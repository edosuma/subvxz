00:30.190 --> 00:34.450
Ariwara no Narihira read it a thousand years ago.

00:34.780 --> 00:36.660
It's a passionate poem of love.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.060
But...

01:09.060 --> 01:10.690
All I can see now...

01:23.910 --> 01:25.870
Are the characters, "Chiha".

02:30.040 --> 02:34.750
[3 years ago]

02:46.450 --> 02:47.830
Please join!

02:50.120 --> 02:51.210
Won't you try out?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.040
Please join!

02:53.960 --> 02:55.210
Let's do our best together!

02:55.210 --> 02:56.210
Mashima!

02:56.210 --> 02:57.710
Taichi!

02:57.710 --> 02:58.760
Wassup!

02:58.840 --> 02:59.720
Hey!

02:59.720 --> 03:01.300
Are you still going to join soccer in high school?

03:01.300 --> 03:02.220
I guess.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.260
You?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.430
I'll surely join the Karuta club.

03:06.010 --> 03:07.020
Karuta club?

03:07.020 --> 03:07.520
Yup.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.340
No way.

03:08.340 --> 03:09.060
Really.

03:09.060 --> 03:11.060
All the guys in our class are going to join the Karuta club.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.060
Ours too.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.100
Why?

03:13.150 --> 03:15.230
Huh? Haven't you heard?

03:15.480 --> 03:16.770
Look here. Look.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.320
The little sister of Chitose Ayase right here

03:19.320 --> 03:22.030
is enrolled here and said she'll form a Karuta club.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.660
The Hundred Poems each

03:26.080 --> 03:28.700
have first verses and second verses.

03:29.080 --> 03:33.670
You first arrange in front of you the second verses.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.630
When the reader says the first verse,

03:37.880 --> 03:40.590
you then pick up its corresponding second verse.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.430
That's all.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.090
Simple, right?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.850
Yeah, yeah.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.430
Then, let's try it out.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.770
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms,

03:55.770 --> 03:57.900
but for winter.

03:58.270 --> 04:05.200
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.

04:08.450 --> 04:16.380
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.480
From this world

04:32.430 --> 04:33.220
Whoa.

04:33.260 --> 04:34.980
I don't wanna go!

04:34.980 --> 04:36.980
Come on! Let's go!

04:36.980 --> 04:37.860
Hey!

04:37.860 --> 04:38.900
W-wait!

04:42.740 --> 04:44.450
Hey Hasegawa! Hey! What's wrong?!

04:44.450 --> 04:46.530
No way! No! No! No!

04:47.070 --> 04:48.660
Wait!

04:52.410 --> 04:53.290
Here she is!

04:53.290 --> 04:56.120
Hey, look, look.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.670
It's fine if it's 4-to-1 next time!

04:57.670 --> 04:58.460
Sorry!

05:00.670 --> 05:02.510
Damn! The little sister's also too cute!

05:02.510 --> 05:03.420
So cute!

05:03.420 --> 05:04.420
Did you see her, Mashima?

05:04.420 --> 05:05.090
Huh?

05:09.350 --> 05:10.390
Mizusawa!

05:10.390 --> 05:13.600
Fight! Fight! Fight!

05:13.600 --> 05:14.560
Mizusawa!

05:14.560 --> 05:17.770
Fight! Fight! Fight!

05:24.740 --> 05:25.570
Hey you!

05:26.280 --> 05:29.620
Let's see!

05:31.780 --> 05:35.000
You're Shiranami Karuta Society's Taichi Mashima, right?!

05:35.160 --> 05:37.460
Whoa! Long time no see!

05:37.500 --> 05:39.040
How many years has it been?

05:39.170 --> 05:39.710
Hey!

05:39.710 --> 05:41.460
Wait! What?!

05:41.880 --> 05:43.590
You're doing tennis?

05:43.590 --> 05:44.170
That's not it.

05:44.170 --> 05:46.840
Oh come on now! Don't be shy!

05:46.840 --> 05:50.550
Now that we're in high school, Karuta's out of the question.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.470
Right.

05:51.470 --> 05:53.970
If you're going to join a club, it should be a popular one, right?

05:54.350 --> 05:57.310
Come on, why don't you join our club.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.560
Let's smash together to Air K!

06:06.400 --> 06:07.280
Who was that?

06:08.030 --> 06:12.620
Because it is required to join club activities in our school,

06:12.830 --> 06:16.910
please choose wisely what club you're going to join.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.920
That is all for today.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.880
Mashima.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.880
Taichi Mashima?

06:36.890 --> 06:39.480
We've only just met so no.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.400
Saki!

06:49.110 --> 06:50.570
What if you're so rich!

06:50.570 --> 06:52.200
So smart!

06:52.200 --> 06:54.700
Good at sports, and above all good looking!

06:54.700 --> 06:56.540
Don't get ahead of yourself!

06:56.540 --> 06:59.410
Hm? Did I just got praised?

07:05.290 --> 07:06.550
No way!

07:07.880 --> 07:08.800
Hey!

07:15.760 --> 07:16.310
Hey!

07:17.060 --> 07:18.060
Hey!

07:19.930 --> 07:21.390
I don't know his name...

07:21.770 --> 07:22.980
Hey!

07:22.980 --> 07:24.650
Air, Air K!

07:24.650 --> 07:27.360
K! Sir!

07:27.440 --> 07:29.990
Anyone there!

07:30.820 --> 07:33.070
Help!

07:40.160 --> 07:41.460
It's no good.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.520
Taichi?

08:14.968 --> 08:15.973
Hey.

08:16.257 --> 08:17.235
It's you, Taichi!

08:17.830 --> 08:19.370
Elementary school was the last time we met.

08:19.715 --> 08:21.084
Taichi!

08:25.710 --> 08:27.960
Please help!

08:27.960 --> 08:31.510
Ma'am? Kana?

08:31.880 --> 08:35.470
Please help!

08:36.140 --> 08:39.809
Hey! Someone! Anyone! Please help!

08:39.809 --> 08:42.059
Ah! Ah! Hey! Hey! You over there!

08:42.059 --> 08:44.350
Hey! The girl over there in school uniform!

08:44.350 --> 08:47.020
Ah! Hey! Hey! The girl over there in school uniform!

08:47.020 --> 08:49.360
Hey!

08:50.190 --> 08:52.690
Chihaya, you aren't popular with the guys, are you?

08:53.240 --> 08:55.820
By the way, why are you in this school?

08:55.820 --> 08:59.040
Didn't the middle school you were also had a high school?

08:59.040 --> 09:02.860
And spend three more years commuting 2 hours each way?

09:06.040 --> 09:07.580
Taichi!

09:08.920 --> 09:10.130
What?

09:11.380 --> 09:14.300
This is "Seo hayami".

09:14.920 --> 09:16.430
"Seo hayami"?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.036
This must be fate!

09:18.036 --> 09:18.930
[ Let's make a Karuta club together ]
This must be fate!

09:18.930 --> 09:20.497
[ Let's make a Karuta club together ]

09:22.930 --> 09:25.890
I've decided that I would build a Karuta club once I entered high school.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.690
We can enter team competitions if there are 5 members.

09:30.110 --> 09:33.530
The summer's nationals will be held at Oumi Jinguu!

09:33.530 --> 09:36.400
It's like the Koushien of Karuta!

09:38.860 --> 09:39.870
What?

09:40.700 --> 09:41.530
Sorry.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.790
You're still so into Karuta.

09:45.870 --> 09:47.830
Of course I am.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.840
You, me, and Arata made a pact to keep playing, right?

09:53.460 --> 09:54.960
What's so funny?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.930
You haven't changed at all.

10:04.890 --> 10:05.600
Here.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.150
Besides, is it good to find members

10:09.150 --> 10:11.310
who won't play Karuta as passionate as you?

10:13.940 --> 10:16.440
I'll do soccer.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.490
What? You're kidding, Taichi!

10:21.490 --> 10:23.580
Hey, hey! You're kidding, right?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.250
Stupid Taichi!

10:30.250 --> 10:33.500
Ms. Ayase! I've not enough words

10:33.590 --> 10:35.250
for what you're doing!

10:36.010 --> 10:38.050
What kind of merchant do you think you are?

10:38.670 --> 10:41.760
Posters are limited to size A4!

10:42.510 --> 10:45.470
As for all of you, go back to your classrooms!

10:45.510 --> 10:47.140
Yes, Ma'am.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.190
Karuta freak.

11:00.110 --> 11:03.280
What do you want, soccer freak?

11:08.330 --> 11:11.120
Have you kept in touch with Arata?

11:15.380 --> 11:17.630
I didn't get a New Year's card from him this year.

11:19.130 --> 11:20.260
You?

11:21.340 --> 11:22.050
Nope.

11:23.890 --> 11:28.100
I heard that he wasn't in last year's national tournament either.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.980
I see.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.350
I wonder what happened.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.480
Maybe he found something more important that Karuta to him.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.570
Is there something like that?

11:40.570 --> 11:43.220
Wow. You heard what I said with a straight face.

11:43.220 --> 11:46.090
No seriously. Nothing comes to mind.

11:46.410 --> 11:47.550
Give me an example.

11:47.550 --> 11:49.550
Example?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.290
Like a girlfriend.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.210
Arata having a girlfriend?! No way!

11:58.210 --> 12:00.590
But we're already high schoolers!

12:01.220 --> 12:03.180
We won't always be doing Karuta.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.050
It's different now.

12:06.430 --> 12:07.720
Compared to then.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.270
I know. Let's do this, Taichi.

12:15.270 --> 12:18.270
If I win this Sunday's tournament,

12:19.110 --> 12:20.990
you're going to help me make the Karuta club.

12:21.110 --> 12:22.570
Why should I?

12:22.570 --> 12:23.740
It's a promise then.

12:23.740 --> 12:24.700
Hey!

12:25.450 --> 12:26.570
Hey!

12:53.080 --> 12:55.200
Taichi.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.360
"Seo hayami"?

13:06.780 --> 13:09.780
"Though divided, on it rushes,
And at last unites again."

13:10.530 --> 13:12.200
You're so slow, Taichi!

13:13.620 --> 13:15.290
"Kimi ga tame"

13:15.500 --> 13:18.380
"But now it is my heart's desire
It may long, long years endure."

13:19.460 --> 13:20.920
"Yo no naka wa"

13:21.960 --> 13:24.630
"Of the little fishing boat
Drawn by ropes along the bank."

13:26.930 --> 13:28.640
"Inishie no"

13:29.090 --> 13:29.970
Ouch!

13:30.600 --> 13:32.770
"In our 9-fold palace court
Shed their sweet perfume today."

13:36.310 --> 13:39.810
Say, since you're moving back to Fukui,

13:40.480 --> 13:46.400
starting next week, you can snowball fight like this everyday, right?

13:48.700 --> 13:49.950
Got you!

13:58.000 --> 14:00.670
Did it hurt? Sorry, sorry.

14:06.550 --> 14:08.090
Thank you...

14:10.180 --> 14:12.510
For playing Karuta with me...

14:17.390 --> 14:18.640
Most likely...

14:19.850 --> 14:21.440
We'll never see each other again...

14:28.700 --> 14:29.780
Why?

14:34.870 --> 14:36.410
But we...

14:37.870 --> 14:39.620
...have Karuta.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.040
Won't we meet again?

14:51.010 --> 14:53.260
If you continue playing, we'll see each other again.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.180
We'll surely see each other again.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.250
It was not for this

15:27.250 --> 15:32.130
I prayed at the holy shrine
That she would become

15:34.430 --> 15:37.810
She's a finalist.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.860
Eyelashes! How much you've grown!

15:45.860 --> 15:47.610
Sir Harada.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.440
Mr. Tsuboguchi's here too. Sorry for not keeping in touch.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.610
I've been worried since you've not shown yourself in the Karuta Society.

15:52.990 --> 15:55.120
It's not just your eyelashes that are all bushy now?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.030
Don't, don't, don't.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.280
Sorry.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.040
Glasses should have grown too.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.960
Arata is...

16:04.330 --> 16:05.500
I'm not sure.

16:05.500 --> 16:13.260
As pitiless and as cold
As the storms on Hase's hills.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.100
It is by its breath

16:17.140 --> 16:19.180
That's too close. Who got it?

16:19.180 --> 16:21.100
Are wasted and driven.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.640
Alright. Chihaya got it.

16:25.180 --> 16:29.690
Didn't she tried snatching it before the first syllable?

16:30.860 --> 16:32.990
The sound before the sound.

16:34.530 --> 16:39.790
Chihaya already heard the "F" of "Fu".

16:41.000 --> 16:43.120
Is that even possible?

16:43.330 --> 16:45.420
Our sleeves were wet with tears

16:47.500 --> 16:49.460
To the dim cottage

16:50.960 --> 16:51.460
If the maple leaves

16:54.220 --> 16:58.600
She has the most important skill for Karuta.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.270
Good ear?

17:02.390 --> 17:05.520
She'll become more and more stronger.

17:05.730 --> 17:07.349
Surely there is none

17:07.400 --> 17:08.730
If your name is true,

17:08.730 --> 17:10.819
She did it by herself.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.410
Even if you guys were gone. Even after that.

17:19.910 --> 17:21.700
I wonder if the gods of Karuta

17:22.369 --> 17:24.910
was watching over Chihaya.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.960
Why do the cherry's new-blown blooms

17:31.960 --> 17:37.260
Scatter like restless thoughts?

17:48.690 --> 17:51.730
To Tago's coast, I see
Perfect whiteness laid

17:51.730 --> 17:53.570
She won.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.400
Thank you very much.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.740
Thank you very much.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.010
Hey Chihaya.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.170
You don't have to cry.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.470
She's dead.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.350
Huh?

18:30.900 --> 18:33.980
She always fall asleep after a match because of burnout.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.650
Come on, let's carry her.

18:36.030 --> 18:36.990
Carry?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.280
What a bothersome girl!

18:40.280 --> 18:44.080
Once you competed to many matches, the player's brain will ran out of sugar.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.830
And you can even lose three kilograms.

18:46.950 --> 18:47.620
Over there.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.120
Wait, wait, wait! Watch out! Ouch!

18:49.120 --> 18:50.293
Ouch!

18:50.750 --> 18:51.790
You okay?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.800
Bye then. I still have things to do.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.460
I'll leave her to you, Eyelashes.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.090
Hey, hey, Sir! Wait!

19:46.220 --> 19:48.390
What repentance is this?

19:50.213 --> 19:51.480
Taichi.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.020
Oh, you're awake. If you're awake then...

19:54.020 --> 19:55.980
It's alright if you forget

19:57.400 --> 19:58.610
about the Karuta club.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.870
The last card that that was left of me was

20:08.740 --> 20:10.910
"Tare o ka mo"

20:13.500 --> 20:20.590
That poem means that my old friends are now gone.

20:34.770 --> 20:35.690
But...

20:37.730 --> 20:40.030
I still think that us three

20:41.030 --> 20:42.950
are still a team.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.570
Even if we play Karuta

20:50.040 --> 20:51.660
or not.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.540
Just you wait Taichi.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.510
Once I make a Karuta club,

21:06.090 --> 21:08.890
I'm going to make Mizusawa a prestigious school of Karuta.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.940
The members will increase.

21:17.150 --> 21:22.190
I'll still teach Karuta to the juniors even after I graduate.

21:25.740 --> 21:28.280
Like how fun Karuta is.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.540
I will make Arata's passion

21:34.471 --> 21:35.813
be spread

21:37.715 --> 21:39.911
and spread

21:40.000 --> 21:42.880
to lots of people.

21:51.970 --> 21:53.560
Are you a kid?

22:02.070 --> 22:04.400
Huh? There's a condo unit here now.

22:13.660 --> 22:14.410
Chi! Bye bye!

22:14.410 --> 22:15.450
Bye bye!

22:21.130 --> 22:23.880
Hey guys. Have you thought about it?

22:23.880 --> 22:25.010
Karuta club.

22:27.550 --> 22:29.970
We don't think we can do Karuta.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.970
Why don't you join the track again, Chi. It looks fun.

22:36.930 --> 22:37.730
But...

22:38.100 --> 22:40.020
I want to do Karuta in high school.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.150
Oh no, we're running out of time.

22:41.150 --> 22:42.110
Oh no!

22:42.730 --> 22:43.480
Sorry.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.940
Sorry, Chi.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.190
See you.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.490
See you.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.570
Take care.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.880
I got this old one from the tea ceremony club.

23:51.220 --> 23:53.140
There are three more so help me out.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.160
Air!

24:05.770 --> 24:07.530
Look out! Look out! Watch it!

24:07.530 --> 24:09.180
Sorry about that. Don't mind it.

24:11.490 --> 24:13.070
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

24:13.490 --> 24:15.660
What are you doing?

24:18.910 --> 24:19.660
No way! Wait!

24:19.660 --> 24:21.000
Carry it properly.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.290
No!

24:22.290 --> 24:24.000
Why do you go that way?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.500
I told you.

24:25.790 --> 24:29.130
The only way it could be an official club

24:29.130 --> 24:31.010
is to have at least 5 members.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.970
Please re-consider.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.050
I can't.

24:34.430 --> 24:36.680
Search for two more.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.066
Two?

24:42.100 --> 24:43.690
There is one thing.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.350
There's a student who

24:46.350 --> 24:48.480
has not joined any club yet.

24:49.610 --> 24:52.690
Whatever we do, we can't make 5 members.

24:52.690 --> 24:54.240
Hey! What should we do?

24:54.530 --> 24:56.160
How about Air K?

24:56.160 --> 24:56.950
Come on now.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.700
That's now Air Karuta of course.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.950
In other words, it's the approach.

24:59.950 --> 25:01.700
Hey, you're joining the Karuta club?

25:01.700 --> 25:03.710
Of course I will. Who do you think I am?

25:03.710 --> 25:05.670
No way! Alright!

25:05.670 --> 25:06.950
This is good news, Taichi!

25:06.950 --> 25:07.540
Nice to meet you.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.000
I'm Chihaya Ayase.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.920
What's with you? This is not the first time we met.

25:12.210 --> 25:15.430
Don't you remember? Your team against

25:15.680 --> 25:17.430
our team in the team competition years back.

25:18.140 --> 25:18.970
Right?

25:19.470 --> 25:20.720
Who are you again?

25:22.770 --> 25:23.680
Don't you remember?

25:24.600 --> 25:25.890
I see now!

25:25.980 --> 25:28.520
You don't remember since you butchered me instantly.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.640
Right, right, Mashima?

25:29.640 --> 25:30.900
No, I don't remember you either.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.490
You traitors! You don't remember?! Come on, come on!

25:33.900 --> 25:35.400
My name starts with "Ni".

25:35.520 --> 25:36.060
Ni?

25:36.060 --> 25:37.020
Ni.

25:37.020 --> 25:38.460
Ni...

25:38.460 --> 25:39.780
Ni...!

25:39.780 --> 25:40.870
Nikuman/Meat Bun!

25:40.950 --> 25:42.330
How rude! This is a pork stew bun!

25:42.370 --> 25:44.080
No! No! No! You're really Meat Bun!

25:44.080 --> 25:45.460
You were also eating that time.

25:45.750 --> 25:46.460
Meat bun?

25:46.460 --> 25:47.460
Was I eating?

25:47.460 --> 25:49.000
During the team competition...

25:50.540 --> 25:52.590
Wait!

25:52.590 --> 25:54.710
What is she, a pre-schooler?!

25:55.010 --> 25:57.800
Nishida! The name is Nishida!

25:58.970 --> 26:00.100
Meat Bun!

26:00.970 --> 26:02.600
The placement of the kimono...

26:03.680 --> 26:04.770
is reversed.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.360
Sorry.

26:22.120 --> 26:25.370
He is our last hope.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.750
Everyone calls him Desk/Tsukue in secret.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.380
That's because he's always at his desk.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.170
This is impossible.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.340
He passed the entrance examinations as second place.

26:38.470 --> 26:40.720
It really suits him to play Karuta.

26:41.090 --> 26:42.010
Come on.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.640
Go away!

26:46.640 --> 26:49.190
Wait! Hold on!

26:50.400 --> 26:52.480
Excuse me, Desk.

26:57.150 --> 27:00.610
This is a desk. This is a wooden desk.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.370
Is it made of cedar or zelkova?

27:02.370 --> 27:04.580
It's lauan plywood.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.080
I see.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.660
What do you want?

27:10.670 --> 27:12.500
Are you going to join a club?

27:13.840 --> 27:15.880
How about joining the Karuta club?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.300
Karuta?

27:20.090 --> 27:21.890
Of all the clubs, why Karuta?

27:22.140 --> 27:23.510
You see...

27:24.680 --> 27:28.100
I'm antisocial. Find someone else.

27:38.940 --> 27:39.440
What the...?

27:39.440 --> 27:42.280
Wait! Wait! Why are you running away?!

27:46.530 --> 27:48.290
I said wait!

27:48.870 --> 27:52.170
The high school that wins the nationals

27:52.170 --> 27:54.210
are considered prestigious.

27:54.210 --> 27:55.040
Do you know why?

27:55.040 --> 27:55.880
Who cares...

27:55.880 --> 27:59.880
That's because you use your head when playing Karuta.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.340
In other words...

28:01.340 --> 28:03.510
If you're good at Karuta...

28:12.560 --> 28:14.480
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry!

28:15.650 --> 28:16.730
Mother!

28:16.730 --> 28:18.610
Why are you calling your mother? Wait, wait, wait.

28:18.610 --> 28:20.240
Aren't you interested in Karuta?!

28:21.400 --> 28:22.610
Do you like Karuta?

28:23.360 --> 28:25.370
Yes. You see...

28:25.370 --> 28:26.910
How do I put it...

28:26.910 --> 28:28.080
The Ogura Hundred Poems

28:28.080 --> 28:29.490
is a Japanese culture we should be proud of.

28:29.490 --> 28:33.370
Anyway, could you check out the Karuta club?

28:33.870 --> 28:36.380
For me to give practice to Karuta is...

28:37.090 --> 28:38.590
Is...

28:39.300 --> 28:42.090
...is an elegant hobby.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.180
Alright! Got it!

28:51.470 --> 28:53.060
Dammit!

28:53.060 --> 28:54.190
What is this?

28:54.440 --> 28:57.560
Isn't competitive Karuta so cool?!

28:57.610 --> 28:59.440
You frequently jam your fingers.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.360
I can't seem to hear the poem at all.

29:03.780 --> 29:04.700
Poem?

29:05.410 --> 29:07.740
You can take cards even if you don't hear the songs.

29:07.740 --> 29:08.620
The "Beginning Character"...

29:08.620 --> 29:09.910
Silence!

29:09.950 --> 29:13.250
They are magnificent poems passed down to us from ancient times.

29:13.620 --> 29:14.750
This is...

29:15.420 --> 29:16.460
This is...

29:17.000 --> 29:18.590
This is blasphemy!

29:20.920 --> 29:23.260
Ah! Wait...

29:25.630 --> 29:27.590
There she goes...

29:28.050 --> 29:29.930
She loves traditional stuff?

29:30.220 --> 29:32.720
Ayase, you should give her up.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.850
She doesn't suit competitive Karuta.

29:35.390 --> 29:38.730
No! There is no bad person who likes Karuta.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.740
Here.

29:46.138 --> 29:49.642
[ Application ]

29:49.642 --> 29:51.310
[ Resignation ]

29:52.450 --> 29:54.160
Don't get the wrong idea.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.420
I will only join because of school regulations.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.000
I will quit whenever I want to.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.500
Oh my.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.750
And if I don't leave within 6 seconds

30:01.750 --> 30:03.710
I might not catch my usual train.

30:27.490 --> 30:31.200
Where are you Oe?

30:31.490 --> 30:32.950
Kana!

30:32.950 --> 30:35.330
You'll get scolded if you don't run.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.620
So you hate running.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.670
Running while wearing a hakama

30:40.830 --> 30:43.170
is a ribald thing to do.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.630
Ribald?

30:46.170 --> 30:48.930
My family is in the traditional clothing business.

30:49.930 --> 30:51.640
That's so cool!

30:52.010 --> 30:56.930
I chose the archery club because I can wear kimono.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.900
I deeply love the cultivated Japanese culture.

31:01.900 --> 31:05.150
Despite it all, the symbolic Hundred Poems

31:05.150 --> 31:07.990
is being used as a fastest fingers first ultra quiz contest.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.240
Um, you see... It's true that

31:14.240 --> 31:17.700
Karuta is being used where you won't hear many of the characters.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.910
But I like a poem out of it.

31:20.370 --> 31:21.540
Do you know?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.590
"Chihayaburu Kamiyo /
Even when the gods held sway"

31:23.630 --> 31:25.580
"Held sway in the ancient days,
I have never heard"

31:25.580 --> 31:27.680
"That water gleamed with autumn red
As it does in Tatta's stream"

31:31.300 --> 31:34.510
The first person who taught me Karuta said this to me.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.770
He said this is my poem.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.440
Your sweetheart said it?

31:43.350 --> 31:44.360
Your sweetheart said it right?

31:44.360 --> 31:45.730
No, no, no. Um. No.

31:45.730 --> 31:48.990
No, no. He's not my sweetheart.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.700
Why'd you ask?

31:52.740 --> 31:55.780
Because it's a love poem.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.040
Love?

31:59.540 --> 32:03.000
The poem is about the Tatta's stream is filled with autumn red,

32:03.000 --> 32:04.880
and looks so pretty, right?

32:04.880 --> 32:06.630
You are indeed correct.

32:06.630 --> 32:11.470
But a thousand years ago, Ariwara no Narihira hid his love with it.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.050
Hid?

32:13.380 --> 32:18.060
Because it's a forbidden love with the empress.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.770
This poem is about

32:23.770 --> 32:27.400
former lovers that was dedicated to the empress.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.400
A poem Narihira made.

32:31.820 --> 32:34.820
Through the fierce stream, his passionate feelings

32:34.820 --> 32:37.660
was intense to dye it red.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.960
He is saying that he still yearns for her.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.000
It is that kind of poem.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.470
With such short words,
there can be many ways of reading it.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.180
That's why poems are interesting.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.760
5-7-5-7-7 character form

32:57.760 --> 33:01.220
nowadays is just a 31 character tweet.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.350
Is something wrong?

33:06.980 --> 33:10.070
It has become so red.

33:15.780 --> 33:17.490
My head

33:18.410 --> 33:20.830
has become so red.

33:22.700 --> 33:23.910
Wow.

33:24.290 --> 33:26.790
Wow! Wow! Wow! Tell me more!

33:27.000 --> 33:30.800
Among the Hundred Poems, even though the
43rd poem has a difficult image, is actually about love.

33:31.500 --> 33:35.170
When the people a thousand years ago worry about love,

33:35.170 --> 33:37.890
don't you think you can somehow relate to them?

33:39.510 --> 33:41.260
Let's play Karuta together.

33:41.810 --> 33:44.640
You should tell all of us

33:44.890 --> 33:47.270
about all your beloved poems.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.940
I have...

33:56.240 --> 33:59.660
I have but one condition.

34:12.590 --> 34:13.710
It's fine.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.260
The Karuta club is approved.

34:16.260 --> 34:17.590
Alright!

34:17.590 --> 34:20.179
I'll be the adviser for now.

34:20.260 --> 34:23.260
But I'm busy with the tennis club too.

34:23.260 --> 34:27.440
I'll just leave the responsibilities to the president.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.400
Yes Ma'am. Leave it to us!

34:31.110 --> 34:34.780
From now on, let's aim to win the
Tokyo championships this coming June!

34:35.739 --> 34:37.780
There are two beginners you know.

34:37.780 --> 34:38.739
It's impossible to be a finalist.

34:38.739 --> 34:40.409
It's not impossible, Meat Bun!

34:40.409 --> 34:40.909
Meat Bun?

34:40.909 --> 34:42.949
I'll start training them hard from now on.

34:42.949 --> 34:46.750
Ah! Be sure to leave your Golden Week open.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.409
We'll have training camp.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.510
Excuse me.

34:49.510 --> 34:50.239
Yes, Ma'am.

34:50.710 --> 34:53.920
You're not the President, Ms Ayase.

34:57.900 --> 35:00.990
[ President: Taichi Mashima ]

35:17.400 --> 35:18.820
By the way.

35:19.070 --> 35:21.570
What was Oe's condition for joining?

35:25.120 --> 35:26.580
What are you doing?

35:26.740 --> 35:28.000
I've decided.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.170
I'll call him right now.

35:32.580 --> 35:33.630
Call?

35:39.630 --> 35:41.340
I can't...

35:42.090 --> 35:43.300
But I'll do it.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.430
Call who?

35:47.146 --> 35:48.240
Arata.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.100
I've decided that I'll call him when I make a Karuta club.

35:53.230 --> 35:54.150
Okay.

36:11.290 --> 36:13.170
Yes? Wataya residence.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.250
Hello?

36:18.453 --> 36:20.168
Arata...

36:21.840 --> 36:23.130
It's you, Arata!

36:23.840 --> 36:25.090
Chihaya?

36:26.970 --> 36:28.470
How are you, Arata?

36:29.060 --> 36:30.680
I'm doing good.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.900
Same as always.

36:33.900 --> 36:34.980
You see.

36:35.350 --> 36:38.690
I made a Karuta club now that I entered high school.

36:38.690 --> 36:40.030
Taichi is in it too.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.950
I see. That's wonderful Chihaya.

36:45.570 --> 36:50.290
We will be the Tokyo winners
and will definitely go to the nationals.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.790
So come see us in Oumi Jinguu.

36:55.170 --> 36:57.540
Everyone at our Karuta club will be waiting.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.500
I'm sure you'll get along with them.

37:15.730 --> 37:16.480
Hey.

37:17.900 --> 37:18.770
Hey!

37:35.120 --> 37:37.290
Though a swift stream is

37:37.290 --> 37:42.050
Divided by a boulder
In its headlong flow,

37:43.090 --> 37:52.180
Though divided, on it rushes,
And at last unites again.

37:58.060 --> 38:07.240
What withers and falls away
In this place is I myself.

38:07.610 --> 38:14.330
Is there any way Except by a messenger
To send these words to you?

38:19.330 --> 38:21.710
Arata. I'm off.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.170
I'll leave grandpa to you.

38:25.742 --> 38:26.420
Okay.

38:26.420 --> 38:29.140
That Akira is such a worrywart.

38:29.430 --> 38:32.680
I'll be fine alone.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.100
Just in case something happens.

38:35.350 --> 38:39.190
If the doctor said that one's head suffers like that of a bomb,

38:39.190 --> 38:41.110
anyone would worry.

38:43.690 --> 38:46.070
Get the nail clippers.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.620
Even if the water stream

39:01.000 --> 39:04.250
come across a boulder and be divided,

39:04.840 --> 39:08.130
it will once again be united in one stream.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.260
"Seo hayami"?

39:12.470 --> 39:14.470
I'm sorry about this, Arata.

39:14.810 --> 39:18.930
To think I would be the boulder.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.940
There's nothing to be sorry about.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.860
As long as we play Karuta, we'll meet them again for sure.

39:29.150 --> 39:32.450
We made that pact.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.500
In Karuta, there are only a hundred poems.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.040
So there's a "beginning character".

39:41.040 --> 39:43.210
If you listen to the first verse's first characters,

39:43.210 --> 39:45.170
you will know its corresponding second verse.

39:45.210 --> 39:48.300
And these are the beginner's cards.

39:48.340 --> 39:52.010
There are one to six characters to be the beginning character.

39:52.550 --> 39:54.850
There's a play in words to help.

39:55.930 --> 39:59.890
The first verse's, "Ukari keru / It was not for this" is paired with

39:59.890 --> 40:01.310
"Hageshikare / As pitiless"

40:01.310 --> 40:02.560
So the wordplay would be:

40:02.560 --> 40:03.940
Ukkari Hage / Carelessly Bald.

40:04.270 --> 40:06.020
That startled me. What's wrong?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.690
The poem, "Ukari keru",
is an excellent poem within an excellent poem.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.780
It's a poem where the one cannot profess his love.

40:11.780 --> 40:14.950
It's really a painful poem of unrequited love.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.120
To think that it would be made into...

40:18.120 --> 40:18.660
Carelessly bald?

40:18.660 --> 40:20.370
Stop it!

40:20.370 --> 40:23.370
That unrequited love will surely not bear fruit!

40:23.420 --> 40:25.500
Wow. Kana here is funny.

40:25.750 --> 40:29.460
In competitive Karuta, the one who hears
and knows the beginning character wins.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.260
In order to measure the timing,

40:31.260 --> 40:34.930
the reader will surely read out the second verse once first

40:34.930 --> 40:36.890
before reading the next first verse.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.100
Like this.

40:41.600 --> 40:48.440
And neither have I beheld
Nor crossed its bridge of heaven.

40:48.570 --> 40:52.450
It was not for this I prayed at the holy shrine:
That she would become

40:52.490 --> 40:55.490
If a card is taken from the opponent's territory,

40:55.490 --> 40:58.330
a card will be given from your territory.

40:59.950 --> 41:01.540
That would be repeated over again.

41:01.540 --> 41:05.290
And you win when all of the cards in your territory are gone.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.750
Desk?

41:08.750 --> 41:11.510
If I don't leave in 11 seconds, I won't make it into cram school.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.630
But you should practice more.

41:13.630 --> 41:14.680
Have you forgotten?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.640
I was just free and joined the club.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.100
I didn't join because I'm serious in playing Karuta.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.400
What should we do with Desk?

41:26.980 --> 41:29.230
Maybe we should find other members?

41:29.270 --> 41:31.150
Even if you say that...

41:31.150 --> 41:34.400
It was only Komano who hasn't joined any clubs.

41:36.990 --> 41:38.410
Desk!

41:43.290 --> 41:45.460
I don't want another member besides you!

41:49.130 --> 41:51.710
You can be the only one, Desk!

41:56.300 --> 41:57.840
Come at the training camp!

41:58.640 --> 42:00.430
Be sure to come!

42:25.500 --> 42:27.670
I wonder if Desk will come.

42:30.630 --> 42:32.040
He's alright.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.550
I'm sure he'll come.

42:57.030 --> 42:58.280
Here, here.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.910
Everyone at Shiranami Society!

43:10.920 --> 43:13.840
We will be participating the training camp this time.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.380
We are Mizusawa High School Competitive Karuta Club.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.800
Thank you for having us.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.800
Please treat us well.

43:20.930 --> 43:21.890
Welcome.

43:22.930 --> 43:26.520
He is my and Taichi's Karuta mentor, Sir Harada.

43:26.770 --> 43:28.560
Pleased to meet you.

43:28.560 --> 43:33.420
For 40 years, I'm still aiming to be the Meijin.

43:33.420 --> 43:36.100
He is also the chief priest of this Bubai shrine.

43:36.610 --> 43:38.650
And this is...!

43:38.650 --> 43:40.900
With the help of Sir Harada,

43:40.900 --> 43:43.990
our special menu!

43:44.870 --> 43:47.080
However you look at it, that's impossible.

43:47.290 --> 43:49.160
A match will at least take an hour and a half.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.170
But to win tournaments,
you'll have to enter a lot of matches per day.

43:52.170 --> 43:55.290
That's why we will build stamina for better matches.

43:56.170 --> 43:57.760
Then the first one would be...

43:58.920 --> 43:59.880
Kana!

44:01.220 --> 44:01.970
Let's do it.

44:03.390 --> 44:04.470
Let's do it, Komano.

44:04.470 --> 44:05.930
Okay. Let's start a match.

44:05.930 --> 44:07.510
Everyone get ready.

44:07.510 --> 44:08.640
Understood.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.650
I thought you won't come.

44:17.570 --> 44:19.650
I told you I'm free.

44:20.070 --> 44:21.570
You're right.

44:22.820 --> 44:24.070
Besides.

44:25.410 --> 44:26.990
It's the first time.

44:27.530 --> 44:28.490
What?

44:30.500 --> 44:33.040
That I've been said I can be the only one.

44:41.380 --> 44:43.220
You can do it!

44:46.010 --> 44:47.720
You can do it!

45:15.580 --> 45:16.330
Hey, watch it.

45:16.330 --> 45:16.960
I'm fine, I'm fine.

45:16.960 --> 45:17.580
Come on, I'll do it.

45:17.580 --> 45:19.380
I told you, I'm fine!

45:19.380 --> 45:20.340
You're cutting like a cat's paw.

45:20.340 --> 45:23.470
Then, Chihaya, can you prepare the eggs?

45:23.720 --> 45:25.010
Okay.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.970
Sorry! You okay?

45:27.970 --> 45:29.180
Sorry! Sorry!

45:29.180 --> 45:30.760
It's your fault, Taichi.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.600
Is that you, Chihaya?

45:36.600 --> 45:37.730
Yeah, yeah.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.230
So besides her is Mashima.

45:41.230 --> 45:44.070
Huh? Then who is the other one?

45:44.610 --> 45:45.650
That's Wataya.

45:46.740 --> 45:48.410
That's Arata Wataya, right?

45:48.570 --> 45:49.370
Yup.

45:49.620 --> 45:50.870
Who is that?

45:52.200 --> 45:57.330
He's the grandson of what is said to be the
best in competitive Karuta's history, Wataya Meijin.

45:58.580 --> 46:01.040
Didn't they transferred to
Tokyo because of money concerns?

46:01.040 --> 46:01.920
That's right.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.590
But they were only here for only a year.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.890
Is Arata strong?

46:07.890 --> 46:12.310
Of course he is. He's the grandson of an eternal Meijin.

46:13.060 --> 46:16.940
He's annually the winner during elementary school.

46:18.060 --> 46:21.690
And guess who's the annual runner up?

46:23.650 --> 46:26.240
You were so strong even then, Meat Bun.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.820
Guess so. I've been told I'm a Karuta prodigy.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.620
But you're always second.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.370
I'm told to be the "capital's lightning"!

46:33.370 --> 46:35.250
But you're still second.

46:37.580 --> 46:39.370
But to win against Meat Bun,

46:39.370 --> 46:41.670
Arata must be something.

46:41.670 --> 46:42.800
Um, Kana.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.630
Stop calling me Meat Bun!

46:44.630 --> 46:48.880
Taichi can't even lose to him when Arata's not wearing glasses.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.930
To think Arata has really bad eyesight.

46:51.550 --> 46:52.850
Did he?

46:52.890 --> 46:55.060
What the? He gave you a handicap?

46:55.060 --> 46:55.560
No, no, no.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.180
When we were doing Karuta in Japanese language class,

46:57.180 --> 46:59.310
the finalists were Taichi and Arata.

46:59.310 --> 47:01.520
During that time, Arata's glasses went missing.

47:01.730 --> 47:04.570
Maybe Mashima hid it.

47:04.570 --> 47:06.530
Taichi won't do something that low.

47:06.530 --> 47:07.740
Right, Taichi?

47:08.650 --> 47:09.530
Yeah.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.160
Really? I'm pretty sure it's his doing!

47:12.160 --> 47:13.660
No he didn't! Why don't you believe me.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.490
No way, no way. I'm pretty sure he'll do it.

47:15.490 --> 47:16.080
He looks like it.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.620
No he won't do that.

47:20.120 --> 47:22.210
15 card difference.

47:22.210 --> 47:24.840
Don't worry about it. You've become a lot stronger.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.300
But you see.

47:26.710 --> 47:29.510
There's nothing wrong with your reactions, Eyelashes.

47:29.970 --> 47:33.100
You just don't put out during the essential moments.

47:33.470 --> 47:36.140
The separated cards have been removed altogether.

47:36.140 --> 47:38.680
What do you mean?

47:38.930 --> 47:41.600
Hmm. It's like this.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.610
You don't have luck.

47:43.610 --> 47:45.020
Does that mean

47:45.020 --> 47:48.440
the Karuta's gods are not with him?

47:48.820 --> 47:50.110
Hey. That's not it, Oe.

47:50.110 --> 47:52.280
No, no. I won't go that far.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.870
Right, Sir?

47:53.870 --> 47:56.120
Maybe he has a bad habit.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.910
Right? To think he's popular with the ladies.

47:57.910 --> 48:00.120
No, I'm not like that.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.580
You've been attacking "Chihayaburu" all out.

48:02.580 --> 48:05.000
I think that's the main cause of it.

48:06.231 --> 48:08.380
I see.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.760
Speaking of "Chihayaburu",

48:09.760 --> 48:12.430
you now go with the same high school with Chihaya.

48:12.430 --> 48:14.090
It's a good thing you two are together.

48:14.430 --> 48:16.220
Hey, wait, wait.

48:16.220 --> 48:17.970
What do you mean?

48:17.970 --> 48:19.520
I think it was autumn of last year.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.440
I stumbled with Taichi at the station,

48:21.440 --> 48:23.900
I told him that Chihaya will go to Mizusawa.

48:23.900 --> 48:25.150
Mr. Tsuboguchi!

48:25.610 --> 48:27.150
That's why you chose Mizusawa, right?

48:27.150 --> 48:28.400
Hey!

48:28.400 --> 48:30.070
Oh my!

48:38.040 --> 48:40.870
I told him to keep it a secret!

48:41.410 --> 48:45.210
Dammit Mr. Tsuboguchi!

48:50.800 --> 48:52.050
A long time ago,

48:52.050 --> 48:55.340
Taichi and Arata used to spend the night here.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.430
I see.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.390
Taichi's sleep-talking was so noisy.

49:02.730 --> 49:04.440
I can't sleep at all.

49:05.060 --> 49:08.110
But Arata was sound asleep.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.440
Um...

49:13.570 --> 49:17.450
Could it be that the one who told you
that "Chihayaburu" is your poem

49:17.870 --> 49:20.370
is Arata?

49:26.120 --> 49:27.750
Yes.

49:28.960 --> 49:30.800
What kind of person is he?

49:39.810 --> 49:41.010
Passionate.

49:48.610 --> 49:55.900
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.

49:58.030 --> 49:58.780
Made white

49:59.370 --> 50:00.030
Wait!

50:02.790 --> 50:03.750
Oh no!

50:04.200 --> 50:05.540
I stuck a card again.

50:05.620 --> 50:08.130
What are you?! You're so strong!

50:10.250 --> 50:12.590
I've been practicing alone all this time.

50:13.670 --> 50:14.880
Alone?

50:15.760 --> 50:19.510
My dream is to be a Karuta Meijin.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.008
Dream?

50:22.970 --> 50:25.180
Why? Why Meijin?

50:26.180 --> 50:29.480
That's because if you become the best in Karuta in Japan,

50:29.860 --> 50:32.730
that means you become the best in the world, right?

50:34.426 --> 50:36.240
The world's...

50:38.355 --> 50:39.857
...best.

50:41.740 --> 50:44.790
To be the best in the world

50:46.750 --> 50:50.210
is something I haven't thought about.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.300
Somehow,

50:57.220 --> 51:01.550
my heart thumped,

51:05.250 --> 51:10.850
and squeezed.

51:14.070 --> 51:15.980
Carelessly bald.

51:17.190 --> 51:20.490
It's the first time I felt like that.

51:20.490 --> 51:21.910
President.

51:23.870 --> 51:27.120
On this 3rd day of training camp, to test their abilities,

51:27.120 --> 51:30.500
I sent Eyelashes and Meat Bun to a tournament.

51:30.540 --> 51:33.790
That sounds so good! I also want to go!

51:33.790 --> 51:36.340
You're running out of money, Chihaya.

51:36.340 --> 51:38.510
That's right!

51:38.590 --> 51:43.800
Even if I should sell this Daddy Bear towel
Harajuku limited edition at Yahoo! Auctions!

51:44.430 --> 51:45.850
No, no, no.

51:46.180 --> 51:49.560
There is a reason I left you here, Chihaya.

51:51.270 --> 51:51.980
Look.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.780
Akihito Sudo.

51:57.780 --> 52:01.150
The Hokuo Academy competive Karuta club he's a member of

52:01.150 --> 52:04.030
had always been participating in the national tournaments.

52:04.030 --> 52:06.280
Champion of the champions.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.920
I wonder what Dad is doing?

52:16.500 --> 52:19.010
Even though he said he'll be back by 8AM.

52:19.130 --> 52:22.970
He's at night shift. He probably got his hands full.

52:25.470 --> 52:26.760
Grandpa.

52:28.930 --> 52:30.930
Maybe I should not attend this time.

52:30.930 --> 52:32.690
It's alright.

52:32.770 --> 52:36.360
I'll just be fine over here.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.690
But...

52:40.150 --> 52:42.150
You want to be strong, right?

52:42.820 --> 52:47.160
So that you can meet your friends at
Tokyo with your head up high.

52:50.370 --> 52:54.460
Go on. There's nothing to worry about.

52:57.210 --> 52:59.340
I'll finish it quick and come back.

53:06.510 --> 53:07.640
Arata.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.230
Don't forget the image.

53:23.860 --> 53:25.740
Let's have a good match.

53:26.030 --> 53:27.070
Ouch.

53:28.530 --> 53:29.830
Excuse me.

53:31.580 --> 53:33.040
Where's your "sorry"?

53:36.210 --> 53:38.080
Where's your "sorry"?

53:39.590 --> 53:40.420
Um.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.580
But I already said "excuse me".

53:43.580 --> 53:45.580
If you don't apologize, I'll make you cry.

53:47.300 --> 53:48.850
There you have it!

53:49.050 --> 53:51.970
The S in Sudo means super sadist.

53:51.970 --> 53:52.640
Got that?

53:52.640 --> 53:53.310
Go away.

53:53.310 --> 53:54.230
Understood.

53:57.560 --> 53:59.310
Let's have a good match.

53:59.310 --> 54:00.400
Super sadist?

54:01.900 --> 54:03.740
This is the place but...

54:08.320 --> 54:09.280
There.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.053
Okay.

54:14.750 --> 54:16.290
Are you nervous?

54:16.330 --> 54:17.330
I'm not.

54:20.728 --> 54:21.484
Ouch.

54:27.380 --> 54:28.470
Arata?

54:29.950 --> 54:31.253
Taichi?

54:31.760 --> 54:33.010
That Arata?

54:33.680 --> 54:35.140
Arata Wataya?

54:35.680 --> 54:38.020
Um, if I remember correctly.

54:39.431 --> 54:39.946
Ni...

54:40.142 --> 54:41.164
Ni!

54:41.377 --> 54:41.820
Ni?

54:41.820 --> 54:42.440
Ni, ni!

54:42.440 --> 54:43.200
Niku / Meat.

54:43.650 --> 54:44.320
Niku / Meat?

54:44.320 --> 54:45.530
It's Nishida!

54:45.530 --> 54:46.400
Mi-meat?

54:46.400 --> 54:47.450
You came.

54:52.990 --> 54:54.830
Give my thanks to Chihaya.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.960
When I got the call from her,

54:59.420 --> 55:01.540
I thought of participating here.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.170
You should say that to her personally.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.050
Well, you see...

55:09.130 --> 55:11.260
I thought you two are dating.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.770
Well, how should I know that I'm far away.

55:15.770 --> 55:18.980
No, no, no, no. We're not dating.

55:20.650 --> 55:22.190
I see.

55:22.980 --> 55:25.980
We will soon begin the opening ceremony!

55:29.450 --> 55:30.280
Here.

55:31.660 --> 55:32.910
Here's my mobile number.

55:34.950 --> 55:35.910
Thank you.

55:36.540 --> 55:38.500
Please tell that Chihaya too.

55:47.590 --> 55:50.970
In the early dawn
When the mists on Uji River

55:51.220 --> 55:52.680
I'm sorry, Mashima.

55:59.980 --> 56:00.770
So fast.

56:01.140 --> 56:01.850
Here.

56:02.730 --> 56:03.940
He's good.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.360
Right?

56:37.560 --> 56:38.770
It's that time.

56:40.730 --> 56:41.940
That time...

56:43.060 --> 56:44.350
I've been abandoned...

56:51.030 --> 56:54.320
When there is only one left,

56:54.410 --> 56:57.080
this is the "fatal game".

56:57.700 --> 57:00.410
If that happens, whichever card is read first,

57:00.410 --> 57:02.460
the outcome will be decided.

57:03.500 --> 57:07.250
That's because anyone can put weight

57:07.250 --> 57:09.340
at the cards near them.

57:12.300 --> 57:16.640
Like Michinoku prints
Of the tangled leaves of ferns,

57:16.640 --> 57:18.970
And like what it's called,

57:19.260 --> 57:21.020
you only have to test your luck.

57:32.150 --> 57:33.360
Come on.

57:33.950 --> 57:35.780
Come on, "Chihayaburu"!

57:35.780 --> 57:38.450
That I have become confused

57:38.450 --> 57:43.960
But my love for you remains.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.530
You really are no good with fatal games.

58:14.240 --> 58:17.110
You should have yourself exorcised by Sir Harada.

58:17.110 --> 58:18.360
Shut up.

58:21.490 --> 58:24.700
There are still trains running. You can go ahead.

58:25.460 --> 58:30.040
I still have to face Arata Wataya in the finals.

58:35.090 --> 58:37.880
Last time I fought him was in elementary school.

58:40.390 --> 58:43.350
I'll show him how much I've gotten strong.

58:45.680 --> 58:47.140
If you're gonna cry, cry.

58:57.950 --> 59:04.330
At the break of day, Just as though the morning moon
Lightened the dim scene,

59:09.670 --> 59:11.920
That's because you didn't say "sorry".

59:16.880 --> 59:18.680
Isn't Sudo's covering hand incredible?

59:19.430 --> 59:20.180
But.

59:21.220 --> 59:23.140
Do you even have time to worry about her?

59:41.610 --> 59:43.950
The rooster's crowing
In the middle of the night

59:43.950 --> 59:47.370
The highlight is Arata Wataya.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.160
He really is the grandson of the Meijin.

59:51.500 --> 59:55.550
Even if his opponent is enough to be an A level player.

59:56.460 --> 59:59.880
But his current opponent is no match for him.

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:13.690
Thank you very much.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.480
Thank you very much.

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:23.320
You just formed because of liking \Karuta.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.870
To think you're aiming to be champions with these kind of members,

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.080
you are just underestimating us.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.750
Sudo has a girlfriend.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.130
So don't be hasty.

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:05.950
There you are, Desk!

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:08.990
Desk! Everyone is acting strange!

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.290
Wa-wait! Hold it!

01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.080
Hold on! Wait! Wait!

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.250
What's wrong guys?

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:18.920
Won't you practice?

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:22.590
You see...

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.890
I don't know what should we practice for.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.600
That's true.

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:40.270
What? What?

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:44.240
What're you all saying?

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:48.320
Did you think that there won't be players better than you?

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:54.880
Ayase!

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.730
Yes!

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:58.460
Whenever you dive fast, you thrust too much.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.630
The hand thrust is unconditional and is twice the difference.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.300
There are matches you can win but won't!

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.170
Understood!

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.550
Mashima!

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.090
Yes!

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.340
You don't practice swinging at all, do you?

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.470
It's not the time to be shy.

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:12.640
You should drive your body to have more sense of distance!

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.390
Understood!

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.480
Meat Bun!

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.270
Yes!

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.270
Whenever your opponent is a girl,
your percentage of winning is lowered tremendously!

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.400
There is no distinction between girls and boys in Karuta!

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.200
Before you stretch your upper lip, stretch your hand first!

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.410
Desk, what is this?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.290
I made a Karuta app.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.710
Wow!

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:37.540
What is this?

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:40.250
This is awesome, Desk!

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.960
Hey, tell me more about myself!

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.340
That's what I told you, Mashima!

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.840
Desk fits playing Karuta!

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:49.340
That tickles! That tickles!

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.430
Wait, wait!

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:51.350
Lemme see, lemme see.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:52.760
Here's Ayase's.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:57.169
[ Days before Tokyo Tournament ]

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:59.690
Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:05.570
Mizusawa! Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.620
Keep!

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.660
Gotcha!

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.450
"Seo hayami"

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.370

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.290
"Ura", "Kaze wo", "Nagara", "Kimi ga tame wo ", "Harasu"

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.130
Here. Here. Here.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.420
No! Here.

01:03:30.426 --> 01:03:32.248
Got it!

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.980
Sorry.

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:41.230
Okay, Ms. Ayase.

01:03:46.888 --> 01:03:48.160
Okay!

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.300
Come on.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.164
Let's go.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:13.760
What?

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.970
One, two...!

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.662
One more time!

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:28.426
Let's go!

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:30.700
Come on, just a bit more.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.740
I'm done.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.580
Meat Bun.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.250
This is so cool!

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.080
It's so beautiful!

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.540
Kana! Kana!

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.920
Hey!

01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:46.500
Let's go!

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.430
"When I take the path"

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:55.720
"To Tago's coast, I see"

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.560
"Perfect whiteness laid"

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.850
"On Mount Fuji's lofty peak
By the drift of falling snow."

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.940
Mt. Fuji must have been there a thousand years ago too.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.450
It has always been there all this time.

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:20.080
You're crying, Oe.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.420
Am I weird?

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:26.630
No, no.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.210
I'm weird, aren't I?

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:29.800
But...

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.090
I'm deeply moved.

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:39.220
You really love poems.

01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:44.190
Whenever I think about the Hundred Poems,

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:48.440
I'm always overwhelmed by the writers'
sentiments no matter how long time goes by.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.080
Oe.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.290
I came to realize this.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.050
I know when the gods abandoned me.

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.180
President.

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:31.070
If you realized it, I think that's well enough.

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:44.540
Also,

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.130
I think love is superior when you are closer.

01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:51.210
I'll be cheering for you.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:10.020
On Mount Fuji's lofty peak
By the drift of falling snow.

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:12.020
On a mountain slope,

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.980
Solitary, uncompanioned,
Stands a cherry tree.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.860
You strained too much at the last covering hand's escape.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.400
You should loosen a bit.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.370
With a snap of your wrist.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.180
It's easy if it's your territory but if it's in the opponent's territory,

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.180
you should thrust more or you won't reach it.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:31.000
You should move more with your body.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.170
What's wrong, Kana?

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.090
It's so quiet.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.720
It seems like we are the only people here at school.

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.850
Well, it's already this late.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.440
"Morotomo ni" is about a monk

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.230
who read the poem when he endured solitary training.

01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.160
There was only one cherry tree that bloom in the mountains,

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.580
and he call out to it to be a friend since they're both alone.

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:08.250
Isn't it a lonely poem?

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:13.830
"On a mountain slope, Solitary, uncompanioned,
Stands a cherry tree."

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:18.630
"Except for you, lonely friend,
To others I am unknown."

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.590
I don't feel lonely at all.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.310
I...

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:34.613
I hear a poem of strong bond.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.859
As long as you're here,

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.609
I can endure.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.620
That's why...

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:50.580
I want to know...

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.500
...more about you.

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:10.640
Let's win this.

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:13.479
Tomorrow's competition.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.250
Thank you.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:37.500
About what?

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.710
Because you become to love Karuta.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.720
Yeah. That makes me

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.810
happy the most.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.770
See you tomorrow then.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.230
See you.

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:03.030
Yeah.

01:10:09.733 --> 01:10:11.333

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:19.380
Let's do our best.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:22.460
Yeah.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:24.510
Bye bye.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.680
Last prayer?

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:12.550
No way.

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.470
Nothing I prayed came true to me.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.770
That's because of my bad habit.

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.690
Tomorrow's the day. I'll be going too to cheer you on.

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:28.500
Sir?

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:29.320
Yes?

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:33.410
The poem "Chihayaburu / held sway in the ancient days"
is about the gods, right?

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.290
Yeah. You can say that.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.620
If it's held sway in the ancient days,

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:42.670
the gods will surely be there too.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.840
If it's a mobile suit, then it's like Gundam.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.130
What's with that example?

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.010
Why do you ask?

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.400
I met Arata at the last tournament.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.690
So you've met Glasses.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:11.200
He was so incredible.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.530
That's when I realized it.

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:21.170
No matter how much I spend all my adolescent life,
I can't beat him.

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:24.130
Are you talking about Karuta?

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.550
There's also that.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.970
Arata

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:33.800
probably thinks that Chihaya and me are meant for each other.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.970
But despite it all,

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.640
I followed Chihaya and enrolled at Mizusawa.

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.230
Even making the Karuta club is

01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:46.270
only an excuse to be with Chihaya more.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.110
It's not that I really like Karuta.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.860
I'm sorry to say that loud to a Karuta instructor.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:56.780
No, it's alright. I have somewhat realized it.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.790
I'm like that.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.340
Outwitted.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.670

No matter how much I begged,

01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.190
compared to him, the gods would not

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.400
make the poem, Chihayaburu, turn my way.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.450
Eyelashes.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.790
You know the the poem, "Kono tabi wa", right?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.380
Since he wasn't able to prepare the offering,

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.630
autumn leaves were given as tribute.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.970
A poem where the judgment would be left to the gods' decision.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.300
"At the present time,"

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.600
"Since I could bring no offering,
See Mount Tamuke!"

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.810
"Here are brocades of red leaves,
As a tribute to the gods."

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.900
You can chant to the gods or to luck.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:17.700
I think it's the special privilege to the people who give their best.

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:54.160

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:27.210
What can you guys say about my order prediction!

01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.800
Hit the bull's eye.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.960
Next is finally the finals.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.590
That's right.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:33.550
I can't believe it.

01:21:33.970 --> 01:21:35.970
Desk's opponent was really strong.

01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.350
Right, Desk?

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.430
I'll be leaving.

01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:46.060
If 3 members win,
that's enough to have an overall win.

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:48.860
Tests are near too.
Truth is, I don't have time for this.

01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:00.200
Desk!

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:03.620
Isn't it to balance out?!

01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:08.920
To say such kind words as I can be the only one!

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:12.210
The truth is anyone is okay, right?!

01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:16.930
I didn't say it like that.

01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:19.850
I really want you to play Karuta.

01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:21.720
That's true, Desk.

01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:29.190
It's better if I didn't play Karuta.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.190
If I was alone like I was before,

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:36.110
I won't feel like this.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.290
I don't

01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:48.750
have talent in Karuta.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.510
I'm sure that

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.050
I won't be of use later too.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:05.810
I don't have talent too.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.690
I still do it even if it hurts.

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:14.900
I still do it even if I want to ran away.

01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:17.990
I still do it so that one of these days,

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:21.620
I have a feeling I can surpass myself now.

01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:35.590
We will surely win so please cheer us on.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.380
Oh, there you are.

01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:41.180
My, my. How are you?

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.510
He is Shiranami Society's...

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.060
We are Hokuo!

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:45.600
Yeah!

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.730
We are strong!

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:47.230
Yeah!

01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:48.230
Aim for the nationals!

01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:49.324
Yeah!

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.030
We were probably

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.240
playing the team competition as if it's individual competition.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.830
We are not a team yet.

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:14.290
We will now announce the players' order for the finals.

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:18.800
Mizusawa High, #1 - Yusei Nishida.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.720
Here.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.090
Hokuo Academy, #1 - Nayuta Amakasu.

01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.800
Here.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.640

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:31.690
Hokuo Academy, #2 - Haruto Takuma.

Here.

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:36.360
Mizusawa High, #3 - Taichi Mashima.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.110
Here.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.990
Hokuo Academy, #3 - Hiro Kinashi.

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.700
Here.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.370
Mizusawa High, #4 - Chihaya Ayase.

01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:45.280
Here.

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:48.540
Hokuo Academy, #4 - Akihito Sudo.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:49.330
Here.

01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:53.710
Mizusawa High, #5 - Kanade Oe.

01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:54.500
Here.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.920
Hokuo Academy, #5 - Yuuta Ryugasaki.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:24:59.840
Here.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.310
You can now line up the cards.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.270
Let's have a good match.

01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:24.490
Can you say it now?

01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:27.370
Apologizing with "sorry".

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:33.330
We will now begin the finals.

01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:36.330
Let's have a good match.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.840
Let's have a good match.

01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:52.770
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter.

01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:54.730
Hokuo! Let's win all 5 matches!

01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:55.600
Yeah!

01:25:56.730 --> 01:26:02.780
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.320
Mi-

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:03.850
-zu-

01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:04.520
-sa-

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:09.550
-wa! Fight!

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:19.840
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.670
For your precious sake,

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.590
Wow!

01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:29.550
They are a prestigious school of Karuta.

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.640
Nice!

01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:33.680
I got mine here, Sudo.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.100
Of course, we're the top.

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:35.850
Of course we are!

01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:37.100
Sudo, nice.

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.230
Nice.

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:39.360
Let's get the next one too.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.150
Yeah!

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:45.610
To the dim cottage

01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:49.840
The spring has passed

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:51.910
Like a string of gems

01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:53.240
Okay, chance!

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:55.460
It's false touch.

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.170
Let's keep this up.

01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.170
Though he forsook me,

01:26:58.170 --> 01:27:01.340
Over the wide sea
Towards its many distant isles

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:02.050
I have kept mine.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.500
Nice!

01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:14.220
What's wrong with everyone.

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:18.190
They feel like losing.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.150
Also...

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.190
Why doesn't he pick up the cards?

01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:22.860
He doesn't even move.

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:24.610
He doesn't even give stance to prepare.

01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:26.650
Maybe he lost interest.

01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.280
Are you underestimating me?

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.370
You've been checking others for awhile now.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:42.590
It would be well this very day
That I should end my life.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:51.180
On a mountain slope, Solitary, uncompanioned,
Stands a cherry tree.

01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:12.910
"Except for you, lonely friend,"

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:15.540
"To others I am unknown."

01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:20.540
I don't feel lonely at all.

01:28:25.090 --> 01:28:27.010
I...

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:32.430
I hear a poem of strong bond.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.270
As long as you're here,

01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.850
I can endure.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.440
That's why...

01:28:48.906 --> 01:28:52.080
I want to know...

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.330
...more about you.

01:30:18.631 --> 01:30:19.440
Chihaya.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.500
It's alright now.

01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:28.130
Just believe in us and go all out.

01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:48.790
Mizusawa! This is it!

01:31:48.924 --> 01:31:50.284
Yeah!

01:31:50.462 --> 01:31:51.333
Yeah.

01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:16.690
Except for you, lonely friend,
To others I am unknown.

01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:20.780
It was not for this I prayed at the holy shrine:
That she would become

01:32:20.977 --> 01:32:22.257
Alright.

01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:24.830
I got it!

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.700
Nice, Nishida!

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.230
Here they come.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:55.400
When I take the path
To Tago's coast, I see perfect whiteness laid

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.520
Nice!

01:32:56.650 --> 01:32:58.480
I got the "Tago no Ura".

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.120
Hokuo, focus!

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:08.284
Yeah!

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:17.500
On Mount Fuji's lofty peak
By the drift of falling snow.

01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:19.510
Surely there is none

01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:21.800
Like a mariner

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.260
Alright!

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.010
Thank you very much.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.720
Hokuo, one win!

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:35.730
Coarse the rush-mat roof
Sheltering the harvest-hut of the autumn rice-field

01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:37.360
Thank you very much.

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.070
Hokuo, two wins!

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:40.360
Nice!

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.320
Hokuo, only one more win and we're champions!

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.580
We'll get three wins.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.960
Let's get three wins guys!

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:57.590
From Tsukuba's peak

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:58.460
I got it!

01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.590
Chihaya, nice!

01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:00.090
The waves are gathered

01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:01.200
Yes!

01:34:02.462 --> 01:34:04.008
Nice!

01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:17.100
I got it!

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.940
Mizusawa, one win!

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.110
Nice fight, Meat Bun!

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.120
Yes!

01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:26.070
Let me show him these

01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.124
Got it!
Let me show him these

01:34:26.124 --> 01:34:27.030
Got it!

01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:28.570
Nice, Chihaya!

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:31.240
Got it!

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:34.410
Chihaya's hearing has started catching up to the reader's habit.

01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:34.960
Truly, this is where

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.786
Yes!

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:37.540
I still got it!

01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.533
Alright!

01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:51.930
Go, Ayase!

01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:13.620
If it were my wish to pick the white chrysanthemums,
Puzzled by the frost

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.200
Yes!

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.080
Alright! Yes!

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:17.790
She did it.

01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:18.960
Ouch!

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.300
Thank you very much.

01:35:33.850 --> 01:35:35.470
Thank you very much.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.820
Thank you very much.

01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:48.110
To think there are still void cards.

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.700
You take cards in lousy ways.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.000
She's dead!

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.750
She's dead! Dead...

01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:05.460
It's alright. She's just sleeping.

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.960
She's dead!

01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:09.680
Anyway, we still have one more.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.760
She's sleeping?

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.840
It's a fatal game there.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.680
A fatal game.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.600
Oh my. A fatal game.

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:17.480
Fatal game?

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:18.770
That's right.

01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:22.020
I have never seen

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.690
Eyelashes' card being read in a fatal game ever.

01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:30.070
What I have is "Kono tabi wa".

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.410
My opponent has "Chihayaburu".

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.750
There are six more cards that haven't been read.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.960
If "Chigiri okishi" has been read,
I have to be careful to not get a false touch.

01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:58.890
Of the early autumn time,
I by chance might pluck the flower.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.310
Though I do not want
To live on in this floating world, If I remain here,

01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:06.320
Focus!

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:06.820
Yes!

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.730
It'll come next!

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:08.530
Yes!

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.240
Gods, I beg you.

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:16.240
I'm fine having bad luck the rest of my life.

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:17.910
Just please, for now.

01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:19.660
Just now.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.830
Just this once!

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.050
Let me remember only
This midnight and this moonrise.

01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:34.640
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:46.520
Eight-fold cherry flowers
That at Nara--ancient seat of our state--have bloomed,

01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:10.130
No.

01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:19.180
Excuse me.

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:37.240
That's not it.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.100
Thank you.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.530
Mashima is practicing swinging when he doesn't used to.

01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:17.110
He's trying to pull out from the opponent's territory.

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:20.320
In a fatal game?

01:39:22.426 --> 01:39:24.115
Taichi.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.000
That's it.

01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:33.550
If you know it won't come, you should come get it.

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:45.680
I'll get it! I'll get it!

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:48.940
I'll get "Chiha"!

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.110
Chihaya.

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.610
Please watch it.

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.370
President's fate.

01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:13.170
In our nine-fold palace court
Shed their sweet perfume today.

01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:39.400
As dew promises

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.610
Void card.

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.540
False touch.

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.450
Thank you very much.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.710
Thank you very much.

01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:51.060
Mizusawa are the champions!

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:39.020
Taichi!

01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.570
Mashima!

01:42:40.650 --> 01:42:41.980
President!

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.360
A thousand years ago,

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:48.240
Ariwara no Narihira read a passionate poem of love.

01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:51.540
It was fun, isn't it, Taichi?!

01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:54.250
It was so much fun!

01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:56.870
But...

01:42:57.330 --> 01:42:58.920
All I can see now is...

01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:02.170
Look at the characters, "Chiha".

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.737
Chihaya.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.540
Here.

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.130
Arata's mobile number.

01:43:42.210 --> 01:43:44.090
I met him at the last tournament I was in.

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:45.300
You met Arata?

01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:50.140
You should let him know.

01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:52.970
It should be coming from you.

01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:13.740
Hello?

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:17.093
Arata?

01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:19.290
Chihaya?

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.420
Our team

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:27.260
won and are the champions, Arata.

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:29.010
We'll be going there.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.390
We'll be going to the nationals.

01:44:48.190 --> 01:44:49.740
Hey, hey, hey. Here, here!

01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:51.320
You should say something, Taichi!

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.280
Hey, hey, hey.

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.290
I've been thinking we should go eat something delicious.
What do you want?

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:59.000
I wanna go! I wanna go! Let's eat! What should we eat?

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.840
Arata?

01:45:07.431 --> 01:45:08.186
Hm?

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:11.930
I...

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:15.260
have something I have to tell you no matter what.

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:17.600
What is it?

01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:23.020
That time.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.320
I was the one who hid your glasses.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.660
That time, you mean that time?

01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:38.540
Yeah. I took it.

01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:41.500
I see.

01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:46.080
You're a mean guy.

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.420
Yeah.

01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:51.260
I know.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.100
I didn't want her to see

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.600
that I would have badly beaten by you.

01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:03.810
I don't want to be hated

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:06.650
by Chihaya.

01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:08.770
I see.

01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:12.150
I kinda understand where you're coming from.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.360
Arata.

01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:18.780
I...

01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:23.750
still don't want to be hated by Chihaya until now.

01:46:28.710 --> 01:46:30.000
That's because I love her.

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:41.260
That's why, one day, I will defeat you.

01:46:42.930 --> 01:46:46.270
I will surpass you in Karuta.

01:46:50.666 --> 01:46:51.680
Taichi.

01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:57.320
As for me...

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:01.450
I quit playing Karuta.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.066
What?

01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:11.320
I quit Karuta.
