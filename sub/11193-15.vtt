WEBVTT

00:05.299 --> 00:07.791
When we found Ernest Littlefield
on PB2-908,...

00:07.860 --> 00:10.433
...we also discovered
a repository of information.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.493
Meaning of life sort of stuff...

00:13.339 --> 00:17.088
Yes. Based on the four distinct
alien languages inscribed on a wall,...

00:17.099 --> 00:20.015
...we concluded it was a meeting place
for the four races.

00:20.056 --> 00:23.343
- We all reread the mission reports.
- OK. Right.

00:23.376 --> 00:28.375
Well, two days ago, the probe
sent back this image from P3R-272.

00:28.376 --> 00:32.814
You'll see that the symbols match one of
the inscriptions from the meeting place...

00:32.814 --> 00:35.103
...on Ernest's planet.

00:42.731 --> 00:44.723
So you realise what this means?

00:44.811 --> 00:47.018
You know what this circle
of symbols says?

00:48.610 --> 00:51.149
No, I-I don't even know
what it sounds like.

00:51.210 --> 00:55.408
But, based on the Norse rune
at the bottom of this inscription,...

00:55.409 --> 00:59.569
...I'm positive one of the four races
in the alliance is Thor's race - the Asgard.

00:59.570 --> 01:04.528
Obviously, that would make the aliens
that belong to this language their allies.

01:06.129 --> 01:09.129
I believe this world is worth exploring,
Daniel Jackson.

01:25.164 --> 01:27.156
Very strange.

01:27.245 --> 01:32.451
Breathable air, moderate temperature...
Where's the life support coming from?

01:35.001 --> 01:36.993
Walls are solid.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.277
As the probe indicated,
there appears to be no exit.

01:47.319 --> 01:48.813
Well...

01:48.920 --> 01:51.920
...this was an intergalactic waste of time!

01:51.960 --> 01:56.156
Well, wait a minute, sir. Where's
the power for the lights coming from?

01:56.156 --> 01:58.149
What's the point of this place?

01:59.076 --> 02:01.069
<i>Hello!</i>

02:01.156 --> 02:02.436
Hello!

02:02.557 --> 02:07.301
I'm Daniel Jackson. We're peaceful
explorers from the planet Earth.

02:09.514 --> 02:10.925
This is worth a try.

02:12.756 --> 02:14.381
Daniel...

02:14.474 --> 02:18.768
...how long you figure we oughta hang out
here and scratch our cosmic heads?

02:19.474 --> 02:21.466
Well, we can't just give up.

02:21.552 --> 02:23.545
Why not?

02:24.432 --> 02:26.223
Let's go home.

02:33.551 --> 02:36.387
OK... That's something.

02:45.227 --> 02:47.896
<i>Watch yourself there, Teal'c.</i>

02:51.747 --> 02:53.871
What do you see?

02:53.947 --> 02:57.480
Blackness. Filled with coloured lights.

03:17.942 --> 03:18.973
Argh!

03:21.341 --> 03:23.334
<i>Colonel?</i>

03:24.901 --> 03:27.473
<i>Jack! Can you hear me?</i>

03:28.461 --> 03:31.330
His pulse is racing. Daniel, dial the gate.

04:42.485 --> 04:44.728
Pupils are back to normal.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.973
Pulse is fine. You feel OK?

04:49.043 --> 04:51.036
Great. Don't remember a thing.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.956
You were catatonic for about an hour
after that thing released your head.

04:54.963 --> 04:56.954
I can't find anything wrong with you.

04:58.601 --> 05:00.677
Well... okey-dokey.

05:06.281 --> 05:08.606
So what caused this device to appear?

05:10.480 --> 05:11.430
We're not sure.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.309
Colonel O'Neill passed through a circle
on the floor before it appeared.

05:15.319 --> 05:16.860
I was first to look into it.

05:16.959 --> 05:19.531
- What did you see?
- Lights. He saw lights.

05:22.518 --> 05:26.384
That's what he said he saw - lights.
Are we done?

05:27.117 --> 05:31.862
Not exactly. Why didn't the device react
to Teal'c the same way as it did to you?

05:33.237 --> 05:36.273
- I don't know.
- Perhaps because I am a Jaffa.

05:36.317 --> 05:40.754
We've seen alien technologies that are
sensitive to a Goa'uld's presence before.

05:40.754 --> 05:42.331
Like Thor's hammer.

05:42.433 --> 05:46.632
Teal'c looked. I looked. It grabbed
my head. I passed out. I came to.

05:46.634 --> 05:49.836
We're here. We're home... Can we go?

05:49.872 --> 05:52.279
Sir... are you OK?

05:54.151 --> 05:56.144
I'm fine. I'm just fine.

05:57.832 --> 05:59.790
A little tired, maybe.

05:59.872 --> 06:01.995
<i>Colonel...</i>

06:02.069 --> 06:04.394
Are you sure you're OK?

06:05.869 --> 06:07.826
I am absolutely fine!

06:07.908 --> 06:09.901
<i>There is nothing cruvus with me.</i>

06:16.228 --> 06:17.603
What?

06:19.148 --> 06:21.721
<i>You just said there was
nothing cruvus with you.</i>

06:23.067 --> 06:25.391
- I did not!
- Yes, you did.

06:25.466 --> 06:28.088
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

06:28.144 --> 06:30.302
- Didn't.
- Did!

06:30.384 --> 06:33.670
<i>- Cruvus? What is that?!
- I don't know.</i>

06:34.903 --> 06:39.862
Well, I'm guessing you were trying to say
there was nothing... wrong with you.

06:40.822 --> 06:43.692
<i>Why don't you take some time to relax?</i>

06:43.742 --> 06:45.569
You're dismissed.

06:45.661 --> 06:48.699
But do me a favour and stay on the base.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.970
Keep an eye on him.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.302
What is the reason for these
padded gloves, O'Neill?

07:16.894 --> 07:18.887
So we don't hurt each other.

07:21.574 --> 07:24.112
I'll be honest, Teal'c.
It's so you don't hurt me.

07:24.175 --> 07:28.552
If our purpose is to not cause each other
harm, why are we doing battle?

07:29.173 --> 07:32.625
What can I tell you? It's boxing.
It's fun! Come on...

07:38.692 --> 07:42.060
Come on, Teal'c. You gotta
move around a bit. You gotta dance.

07:42.090 --> 07:46.170
I do not understand, O'Neill. Are we
preparing to dance or to do battle?

07:48.090 --> 07:53.000
Teal'c, if you don't move around,
you're a sitting duck. You're a target!

07:55.127 --> 07:56.918
Huh? Like that!

08:00.168 --> 08:02.161
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

08:02.247 --> 08:04.819
- I am fine.
- Well, that's why you gotta move...

08:08.605 --> 08:10.728
How was that, O'Neill?

08:10.803 --> 08:12.797
It was good. It was good...

08:13.363 --> 08:17.882
Uh... The thing about keeping
your hands up... Is my nose bleeding?

08:17.884 --> 08:19.877
You are fine.

08:20.523 --> 08:23.773
Keep your hands up.
You gotta keep your feet movin'.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.757
<i>And, uh... bend your cosars.
Keep your cosars bent.</i>

08:26.802 --> 08:29.637
I am unfamiliar with that word.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.754
<i>What? Cosars?</i>

08:33.961 --> 08:36.332
<i>Cosars. You gotta bend your cosars.</i>

08:38.399 --> 08:41.566
I believe you are referring
to your legs, O'Neill.

08:58.395 --> 09:02.144
<i>All right! What the hell
is going on with me?</i>

09:03.394 --> 09:05.388
What do you mean?

09:05.474 --> 09:08.509
<i>Apparently, I have lost
the falatus to speak properly!</i>

09:10.754 --> 09:13.245
That wasn't a joke.
I didn't do that on purpose.

09:14.712 --> 09:18.758
Several times, O'Neill has used
strange words in place of common terms.

09:20.990 --> 09:25.451
<i>- OK. What was that word you just used?
- I believe it was falatus.</i>

09:26.750 --> 09:29.455
OK. Sounds kind of close
to Medieval Latin.

09:31.230 --> 09:34.644
It's, um... possibly a derivation,
maybe even a root.

09:44.985 --> 09:49.384
<i>Faculatus is Latin for ability. You said
you lost the falatus to speak properly.</i>

09:49.385 --> 09:51.424
<i>Nou ani anquietas.</i>

09:53.184 --> 09:54.644
What?

09:57.344 --> 10:00.215
<i>Nou ani anquietas. Hic qua videum.</i>

10:07.902 --> 10:11.650
- Jack, are you reading this?
- I don't know. You tell me!

10:11.662 --> 10:15.778
I don't know. I haven't even been able
to associate sounds to the symbols.

10:15.779 --> 10:18.780
- Do you know what this means?
- No!

10:18.820 --> 10:22.520
<i>I'm just looking at it
and the words pop right into my fron!</i>

10:26.539 --> 10:28.532
Does anybody think this is odd?

10:33.336 --> 10:37.054
The language he's speaking has
similar sounds to Medieval Latin.

10:37.056 --> 10:40.590
- So he's in the infirmary now?
- Yes. But before we took him there,...

10:40.615 --> 10:43.320
...he picked up a chalk
and did this in 30 seconds flat.

10:45.615 --> 10:47.856
Do you have any idea what this means?

10:48.654 --> 10:52.355
No. Even the simple equations
don't make any sense.

10:54.014 --> 10:56.765
No, this is like no math I've ever seen.

10:57.971 --> 11:00.509
A normal human brain operates at about...

11:00.572 --> 11:03.607
...5-10% of its functional capacity
at any given time.

11:05.571 --> 11:08.986
Colonel O'Neill's brain
is operating at over 90% capacity.

11:09.010 --> 11:11.798
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.950
- Where is Colonel O'Neill?
- He should be in the infirmary.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.463
He is not there.

11:20.929 --> 11:24.133
- Teal'c, you take the gate room.
- I'll check the locker room.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.678
Colonel...

11:30.566 --> 11:32.605
What are you doing?

11:34.566 --> 11:36.557
I need this.

11:36.644 --> 11:38.684
What for?

11:45.403 --> 11:47.397
I have no idea.

11:49.322 --> 11:51.562
- Where is he now?
- He's with Teal'c.

11:51.642 --> 11:54.643
Do you think his current condition
poses any threat?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.088
Sir, I don't even know
what's wrong with him.

11:57.161 --> 11:59.831
But his brain function
has increased tenfold.

11:59.879 --> 12:02.038
Jack was able to read the alien language.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.155
Both the inscription from
the wall on Ernest's planet...

12:05.198 --> 12:08.567
<i>.. and the circle of symbols from 272,
where this happened to him.</i>

12:08.600 --> 12:10.591
What does it mean?

12:11.596 --> 12:14.681
Um... Well, my translation's
a little bit vague.

12:14.716 --> 12:18.755
I think the circle means
"the place of our legacy". Um...

12:18.756 --> 12:23.754
Or it could be "a piece of our leg".
But the first seems to make more sense.

12:23.755 --> 12:28.033
The point is Colonel O'Neill is
unwillingly speaking an alien language.

12:28.034 --> 12:30.657
We know the Asgard oppose
the Goa'uld, so maybe...

12:30.716 --> 12:33.004
...all the races of this alliance
felt the same.

12:33.073 --> 12:35.744
It might explain why
the viewer locked out Teal'c.

12:35.793 --> 12:39.207
- What are you saying?
- What if this device somehow...

12:39.231 --> 12:42.481
...downloaded an alien language
into Jack's brain?

12:42.510 --> 12:45.465
Your presence is required
in the control room.

12:49.471 --> 12:51.463
- What's he doing?
- I do not know.

12:58.389 --> 13:00.596
<i>Captain Carter?</i>

13:00.667 --> 13:02.874
The main system's down. I'm locked out.

13:02.947 --> 13:05.105
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir?

13:05.187 --> 13:07.643
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, sir.

13:07.706 --> 13:10.279
You know me and computers.

13:10.346 --> 13:14.784
- Colonel, I'm ordering you to stop.
- I'd love to, sir, but I can't!

13:14.785 --> 13:17.407
<i>- Stop him.
- No! Not yet! I'm not farit!</i>

13:17.466 --> 13:20.880
Sir, I think he wants to finish
what he's doing.

13:21.865 --> 13:23.442
I can't reboot, sir.

13:24.903 --> 13:27.690
- Uh-oh.
- Captain?

13:28.783 --> 13:31.107
Sir, this is machine code.

13:31.182 --> 13:33.886
He must have been entering
some sort of program.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.365
What did you do?

13:44.341 --> 13:48.337
It's a destination map. These are
all the Stargates we've been through.

13:48.341 --> 13:51.341
Sam, are those new gates popping up?

13:53.418 --> 13:55.411
It's not possible.

13:55.496 --> 13:59.495
It takes days to calculate
the planetary shift of each new location.

14:04.895 --> 14:06.687
Whoa, wait a second.

14:11.696 --> 14:17.013
Sir, the new Stargates did not come from
the Abydos cartouche data that we put in.

14:17.013 --> 14:20.463
<i>But that's the only
reference we have, isn't it?</i>

14:20.493 --> 14:23.162
The colonel must have input
new Stargate locations.

14:23.211 --> 14:26.746
That thing must have put more than
just a language into your brain.

14:28.691 --> 14:31.442
The inscription read
"the place of our legacy".

14:32.490 --> 14:36.690
What if that thing you looked into
was some sort of alien database...

14:36.691 --> 14:38.517
...like the one on Ernest's planet?

14:38.610 --> 14:41.860
All the knowledge that these
particular aliens possessed.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.501
Colonel, you're not under arrest.

14:47.567 --> 14:51.645
But you are also not to touch anything
else on this base without permission.

14:51.647 --> 14:53.639
Understood?

14:56.566 --> 14:58.974
<i>Etium,...</i>

14:59.046 --> 15:01.500
...sir.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.971
You can only stare at a computer screen
for so long.

15:07.004 --> 15:11.831
That program you entered rewrote
massive amounts of the machine code.

15:12.722 --> 15:16.388
Jack's lost the ability to speak
anything but the alien language.

15:16.403 --> 15:18.394
Really?

15:19.402 --> 15:21.025
Wow!

15:21.120 --> 15:25.960
But the good news is we seem to have
more of the alien inscription translated.

15:25.961 --> 15:29.245
<i>"Nou ani anquietas" -
"We are the ancients. "</i>

15:29.278 --> 15:30.688
Who are the ancients?

15:30.799 --> 15:33.634
Well, I think they could be
the teachers of roads.

15:34.798 --> 15:36.790
You see, the Romans spoke Latin...

15:36.878 --> 15:40.577
...and they learned to build roads
from gods known as the ancient ones.

15:40.597 --> 15:42.923
I'm still not following you.

15:42.996 --> 15:44.456
Roads.

15:44.557 --> 15:46.015
Stargates.

15:46.116 --> 15:47.741
The gate builders.

15:49.917 --> 15:53.451
What if these ancients were the alien race
who invented the Stargate?

15:53.474 --> 15:55.679
You're still just speculating, right?

15:55.754 --> 16:00.272
That would explain why Jack knew about
Stargates the Goa'uld haven't discovered.

16:00.273 --> 16:04.312
I don't know, Daniel. Why would they
invent a device that would do this?

16:04.312 --> 16:06.934
"The place of our legacy."
To pass on knowledge.

16:06.993 --> 16:12.270
Jack may have knowledge of the original
gate builders downloaded into his brain.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.561
<i>Ego indeo navo locas.</i>

16:16.072 --> 16:18.065
OK.

16:19.429 --> 16:21.422
<i>Ego means I.</i>

16:21.508 --> 16:23.879
<i>- Indeo.
- Need.</i>

16:23.947 --> 16:25.572
<i>- Navo.
- New.</i>

16:25.668 --> 16:28.374
<i>- Locas.
- Locas...</i>

16:28.428 --> 16:30.421
<i>Locas... Locas...</i>

16:34.508 --> 16:38.292
<i>Locatia. Location. You need a new
location! You need a new location!</i>

16:39.027 --> 16:41.019
Where do you wanna go?

16:45.903 --> 16:49.984
OK... I have to get back to the computer.
I wish you could explain this.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.095
10 = 8?

16:58.101 --> 17:00.095
10 = 8...

17:00.182 --> 17:02.174
10 = 8.

17:05.701 --> 17:07.693
10 = 8!

17:07.779 --> 17:10.020
Sir, this is base eight math!

17:18.778 --> 17:22.935
The problem may only be affecting
the verbal language centre of your brain.

17:22.938 --> 17:27.576
It's a different function than writing.
But it looks like the problem is advancing.

17:27.577 --> 17:29.653
Since he lost his speech gradually,...

17:29.738 --> 17:32.406
...whatever it is may be
taking over incrementally.

17:33.174 --> 17:35.166
What's the worst-case scenario?

17:35.255 --> 17:38.041
Well, your computer analogy's
pretty good.

17:38.693 --> 17:40.686
Colonel, your hard drive...

17:40.773 --> 17:45.173
...is filled with information in a language
your computer doesn't understand.

17:45.173 --> 17:47.925
If it continues to progress
the way it has thus far,...

17:47.972 --> 17:51.592
...you may eventually lose the ability
to write or even comprehend us.

17:51.613 --> 17:55.990
Or worse... the computer
could shut down altogether.

18:01.730 --> 18:05.848
We've sent probes to the addresses
Colonel O'Neill entered in the computer,...

18:05.849 --> 18:09.515
...hoping that one would lead us
to the race that affected his mind.

18:09.528 --> 18:11.402
We may have found something.

18:11.488 --> 18:13.528
P9Q-281 has a pedestaI near the gate...

18:13.607 --> 18:16.941
...with symbols that match
the alien language Jack is speaking.

18:16.967 --> 18:18.960
Then I suggest we check it out.

18:20.244 --> 18:22.782
You're authorised to go, Captain.

18:22.845 --> 18:26.380
Major Castleman will be
joining SG-1 on this mission.

18:26.403 --> 18:28.942
Well, if Jack's not going,
then I have to stay.

18:29.003 --> 18:30.913
Why is that, Doctor?

18:31.003 --> 18:35.241
If Sam and Teal'c make contact with
the ancients and they can report back,...

18:35.242 --> 18:37.236
...then Jack and I will go.

18:37.323 --> 18:39.565
Until then, translating this language...

18:39.643 --> 18:43.961
...may be the most important thing
we've done since we opened the Stargate.

18:43.962 --> 18:45.753
You see, I'm pretty sure...

18:45.840 --> 18:49.173
...Jack is speaking the language
of the original gate builders.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.156
At the least, it's one of the races...

18:51.239 --> 18:54.773
...who created the repository
of information on Ernest's planet.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.709
The, uh, meaning of life stuff.

18:56.798 --> 19:01.317
I believe the equation Colonel O'Neill
wrote down is a revolutionary formula...

19:01.318 --> 19:04.403
...for calculating the distance
between planetary bodies.

19:04.439 --> 19:06.727
<i>Bottom line, sir,
what about Jack?</i>

19:06.798 --> 19:10.748
Right now, I'm his only hope
for communicating on a serious level.

19:10.755 --> 19:12.748
I can't... leave him like this.

19:12.836 --> 19:15.161
And I won't.

19:15.954 --> 19:18.114
All right.

19:18.194 --> 19:20.353
The rest of you will leave at 1600 hours.

19:23.193 --> 19:24.689
<i>SG-1...</i>

19:24.794 --> 19:26.750
<i>Your mission is a go.</i>

19:46.670 --> 19:48.662
OK.

19:48.749 --> 19:51.536
I think we're getting
hung up on the grammar.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.667
OK, you have to go through
the Stargate. Where? Where to?

20:18.223 --> 20:21.722
Back to the planet where this happened?
You have to go back there?

20:26.300 --> 20:28.259
Come!

20:28.340 --> 20:31.258
Sir, SG-1 did not return
the probe on schedule.

20:31.299 --> 20:35.380
- Let's open the gate, try to make contact.
- Yes, sir.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.732
SG-1, this is Stargate Command.

20:40.818 --> 20:42.811
Do you read? Over.

20:44.097 --> 20:46.802
They're responding, sir. Video and audio.

20:48.976 --> 20:53.188
<i>Do not send rescue team.
Repeat, do not send rescue team.</i>

20:54.096 --> 20:58.094
This is General Hammond. We copy,
Captain. Where is Major Castleman?

20:58.096 --> 21:00.087
<i>He's looking for shelter, sir.</i>

21:00.175 --> 21:03.010
<i>We're in a little trouble here.
We can't dial out.</i>

21:03.055 --> 21:06.092
<i>The DHD seized up when we tried
to send the probe back.</i>

21:06.134 --> 21:08.839
<i>The temperature here
is increasing rapidly,...</i>

21:08.894 --> 21:13.011
<i>.. which probably explains why we haven't
found any indigenous life forms.</i>

21:13.011 --> 21:16.925
<i>The probe's data did not reveal a second
sun, which rose half an hour ago.</i>

21:16.931 --> 21:21.569
<i>General, we're gonna get one heck of
a sunburn if we stay here much longer.</i>

21:21.570 --> 21:23.729
Can you dial in manually?

21:23.810 --> 21:25.803
<i>Teal'c's attempting a manual dial...</i>

21:25.890 --> 21:28.807
<i>.. but we can't do it with
the wormhole open from your end.</i>

21:28.849 --> 21:30.593
I copy that, Captain.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.730
If you're not back in one hour,...

21:32.808 --> 21:36.641
...we will open the wormhole again
for further communication. Good luck.

21:36.647 --> 21:37.893
SGC out.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.576
- What's he doing now?
- Building something.

21:54.605 --> 21:58.188
I've been taking some notes,
but I'm finding it hard to follow.

22:05.281 --> 22:08.900
<i>I have to go downstairs.
Sam and Teal'c are in trouble.</i>

22:08.921 --> 22:11.328
Just... don't tell Jack.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.638
I think he's got enough on his mind.

22:24.839 --> 22:27.295
This Mylar material,
added to a field tent,...

22:27.356 --> 22:30.228
...should provide
10-20 degrees' worth of protection.

22:30.277 --> 22:33.112
We've augmented air coolers
to work with generators.

22:33.156 --> 22:37.194
- But how are they gonna get home?
- Based on Captain Carter's description,...

22:37.195 --> 22:40.280
...we've run probability tests
using the function data...

22:40.317 --> 22:43.768
...we correlated so far from
the DHD found in Antarctica.

22:43.796 --> 22:47.833
- Do you understand what he said?
- It sounds like they have no idea.

22:47.834 --> 22:51.085
Actually, it's not no idea, sir.
Just not much of one yet!

22:51.112 --> 22:52.654
But we're working on it.

22:56.551 --> 22:58.295
<i>Manual dialling failed.</i>

22:58.392 --> 23:03.230
<i>The DHD is stuck mid-dial and
seems to be locking the gate in place.</i>

23:03.230 --> 23:05.685
- Are we recording this?
- Yes, sir.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.743
<i>By my calculations,...</i>

23:07.830 --> 23:11.909
<i>.. we could be facing a temperature
of over 200Â°F in less than four hours.</i>

23:11.910 --> 23:13.866
Captain, we're sending through...

23:13.950 --> 23:16.654
...heat-resistant tents
and portable air coolers.

23:16.708 --> 23:20.575
<i>General, I don't think you understand
how hot it's gonna get.</i>

23:21.067 --> 23:24.401
<i>Nothing you send us will
provide enough protection.</i>

23:25.546 --> 23:28.119
<i>We'll be dead before
the end of the day, sir.</i>

23:45.781 --> 23:47.775
I think he's finished.

23:49.021 --> 23:50.396
What is it?

23:58.941 --> 24:00.269
That's it?

24:05.419 --> 24:08.917
OK, well, let's... let's just
leave this thing for now.

24:08.938 --> 24:12.270
I have something a little
more important to discuss.

24:21.656 --> 24:26.374
I didn't want to tell you this before.
I thought you had enough on your mind.

24:26.375 --> 24:29.079
Sam, Teal'c, and the rest of SG-1
are in trouble.

24:29.133 --> 24:32.667
The DHD on P9Q-281 isn't working
and they can't get home.

24:32.692 --> 24:35.978
To make matters worse,
there is a very hot sun rising.

24:36.012 --> 24:38.005
They don't have much time.

24:39.252 --> 24:42.917
<i>The rest of the symbols
won't engage. The DHD...</i>

24:42.932 --> 24:46.098
<i>.. is locking the gate in place
so we can't dial in manually.</i>

24:46.132 --> 24:48.836
<i>I've tried everything I know
about these things.</i>

24:52.131 --> 24:54.538
Look, no one else believes...

24:54.607 --> 24:58.771
...you have the knowledge of the original
gate builders in your head except me.

25:27.602 --> 25:29.595
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

25:30.602 --> 25:35.263
- Do you think this is going to help?
- I-I don't... I really don't... know.

25:40.001 --> 25:41.994
"Shut up and go away."

25:53.916 --> 25:57.617
<i>We can't power up the DHD
and get it to recharge its capacitors.</i>

25:57.636 --> 26:00.093
Removing the power source
and reinstalling...

26:00.156 --> 26:02.066
...rebooted the system in tests.

26:02.156 --> 26:05.324
- We never simulated a mid-dial lockup.
- We have to dial in now!

26:05.356 --> 26:07.729
- What is it?
- The colonel has a solution.

26:09.114 --> 26:11.521
We weren't sure
what he was drawing at first...

26:11.594 --> 26:15.045
- That's the dial-home device!
- And instructions on how to fix it.

26:17.913 --> 26:20.700
- You guys can work on this for a while.
- What is it?

26:20.752 --> 26:24.251
No idea. Actually, not no idea.
Just not much of one yet. Work on it.

26:28.873 --> 26:31.873
The object has reached
its destination, sir.

26:34.269 --> 26:37.435
Now we have to hope
those instructions were right.

26:56.704 --> 26:58.697
Glad to have you back.

26:58.784 --> 27:02.199
I thought our goose was quite
literally cooked this time, sir.

27:02.223 --> 27:04.798
These plans were perfect.
Who came up with them?

27:09.063 --> 27:10.807
Colonel?!

27:17.942 --> 27:20.813
I am sorry, O'Neill.

27:20.862 --> 27:22.855
We could not find a way to help you.

27:32.778 --> 27:34.770
- Feel better?
- Much. Thanks.

27:35.978 --> 27:39.311
- Is this what you wanted to show me?
- Yes. Jack built it,...

27:39.337 --> 27:42.088
<i>.. but no one seems to be able
to figure out what it is.</i>

27:43.136 --> 27:46.090
Colonel, you have no idea
what it is or why you built it?

27:50.334 --> 27:53.667
<i>Captain Carter to the control room.
Captain Carter...</i>

28:01.012 --> 28:02.970
We were preparing to send SG-11...

28:03.053 --> 28:06.967
...to the next new Stargate address
Colonel O'Neill put into the computer.

28:06.971 --> 28:09.723
The gate wouldn't dial out.
The computer is frozen.

28:09.772 --> 28:13.640
That doesn't make any sense.
We just ran a full diagnostic.

28:19.049 --> 28:23.212
The Stargate's trying to draw
more power than usual from the system.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.916
I'm guessing we should follow him.

28:47.723 --> 28:50.891
Should we not attempt
to stop him, Daniel Jackson?

28:50.923 --> 28:53.164
Wait a minute. Jack...

28:53.243 --> 28:55.236
What are you doing?

28:55.323 --> 28:57.197
<i>Euge.</i>

28:57.281 --> 28:59.987
I think that means good.

29:00.039 --> 29:03.076
Jack, I-I really don't know
if this is a good thing.

29:03.119 --> 29:04.946
<i>Euge.</i>

29:05.039 --> 29:07.614
<i>- Euge.
- I don't think he understands any more.</i>

29:16.038 --> 29:20.676
The Stargate just got a huge power boost.
It's drawing ten times more than normal.

29:20.678 --> 29:24.806
- Isn't that impossible?
- Yes, sir. The circuit should have blown.

29:27.395 --> 29:28.972
This is General Hammond.

29:29.075 --> 29:32.325
Sergeant Siler and a maintenance crew
to the power room!

29:37.795 --> 29:39.204
Uh, sir...

29:41.075 --> 29:42.983
The gate is dialling out!

29:43.073 --> 29:46.442
- Where to?
- I have no way of knowing.

29:49.631 --> 29:52.122
We've completely lost control, sir.

29:56.549 --> 29:59.006
Come on, let's go!

30:05.148 --> 30:07.142
Chevron five is encoded.

30:07.229 --> 30:10.846
Jack's device is an energy source.
He hooked it up in the power vault.

30:10.868 --> 30:14.118
That explains where the gate's
getting all the extra power.

30:14.145 --> 30:18.384
I would not have authorised that,
Dr. Jackson. Captain, how do we stop it?

30:18.384 --> 30:20.626
You could have Siler
pull the main breaker.

30:20.705 --> 30:24.743
<i>- Chevron six is encoded.
- Jack says this is a good thing.</i>

30:24.744 --> 30:27.034
- So far he's done nothing bad.
- So far.

30:27.105 --> 30:28.563
Chevron seven...

30:31.023 --> 30:33.230
...is encoded?

30:34.864 --> 30:37.153
- And it's not the point of origin.
- What?

30:40.701 --> 30:44.116
What if all these anomalies
that have been happening to Jack...

30:44.140 --> 30:46.133
...are part of some... big plan?

30:46.221 --> 30:48.759
What plan?

30:50.299 --> 30:53.086
Earlier, Jack said he had
to go through the gate.

30:53.138 --> 30:56.140
Maybe everything up until now
has been leading to this.

30:57.659 --> 30:59.734
<i>What's it doing?</i>

31:02.137 --> 31:04.213
Chevron eight is locked!

31:10.734 --> 31:12.728
The wormhole is tracking.

31:14.894 --> 31:16.354
Captain?

31:16.454 --> 31:19.160
The computer indicates
that the wormhole...

31:19.214 --> 31:21.623
...is leaving our known
network of Stargates.

31:21.694 --> 31:24.778
It's going outside of our galaxy. Far out.

31:24.814 --> 31:27.221
That's why the gate needed
all the extra power.

31:27.290 --> 31:29.284
Hold on.

31:29.372 --> 31:32.788
I thought Stargate addresses
were six points in space...

31:32.810 --> 31:35.432
...with the seventh
being the point of origin.

31:35.490 --> 31:39.849
The extra chevron must add a new
distance calculation to the existing points.

31:39.851 --> 31:42.342
Kinda like dialling a different area code.

31:48.048 --> 31:49.590
Now what?

31:52.406 --> 31:54.400
Colonel!

31:57.766 --> 31:59.923
I'm just supposed to let you go?

32:00.006 --> 32:04.217
He's already gone, General.
I don't think we have much of a choice.

32:23.321 --> 32:25.528
I will accompany you, O'Neill.

32:25.601 --> 32:28.435
I really think he needs
to do this alone, Teal'c.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.621
I really hope this is the right thing to do.

32:36.679 --> 32:40.297
Wait! Without the remote code device,
he won't be able to get back.

32:40.318 --> 32:44.356
Without knowing where he's going and
why, that could put us in further jeopardy.

32:44.356 --> 32:46.682
I'm sorry. I can't authorise it.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.628
Jack...

32:52.717 --> 32:55.883
You understand that
if you do this, if you go,...

32:55.915 --> 32:58.123
...you might not be able to come back.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.420
Traveller is still en route.

33:28.828 --> 33:30.868
We've lost the traveller!

33:36.826 --> 33:39.496
Argh!

34:23.376 --> 34:27.753
<i>Ego... deserdi... asordo.</i>

34:36.817 --> 34:38.809
<i>Comdo... asordo.</i>

34:56.851 --> 34:58.844
I'm gonna redial.

35:02.331 --> 35:04.903
The computer won't accept
the eighth chevron.

35:09.128 --> 35:11.168
<i>- Hammond.
- It's Sergeant Siler, sir.</i>

35:11.248 --> 35:15.791
The device that's hooked to
the power grid? It seems to be dead.

35:28.246 --> 35:29.574
Hello.

35:43.523 --> 35:45.516
Um...

35:48.041 --> 35:49.786
Thank you.

35:49.882 --> 35:52.123
You are welcome.

35:55.201 --> 35:58.652
- You understand me?
- We speak many languages.

35:59.759 --> 36:02.760
You're the Asgard - Thor's race. Right?

36:02.797 --> 36:05.835
- You have heard of us?
- Nothing but good things.

36:05.878 --> 36:09.744
You looked into the archive
that stores all the ancients' knowledge.

36:09.757 --> 36:11.001
Apparently.

36:11.117 --> 36:12.943
It was not meant for you.

36:15.476 --> 36:17.469
What...?

36:18.277 --> 36:20.849
This was all an accident?

36:21.516 --> 36:23.509
Human physiology...

36:23.594 --> 36:27.831
...has not advanced to the point where
your brain could handle that technology.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.826
Oh...

36:31.672 --> 36:33.666
Uh... So...

36:34.672 --> 36:36.166
...where am I?

36:36.271 --> 36:38.264
This is the Asgard planet Othala...

36:38.353 --> 36:40.346
...in the galaxy of Ida.

36:43.192 --> 36:45.231
Why did I come here?

36:46.829 --> 36:50.530
The ancients moved on from
our region of space long ago.

36:50.550 --> 36:53.882
Your subconscious mind used
their knowledge to find us here,...

36:53.909 --> 36:56.197
...where you could get help.

36:56.268 --> 36:57.846
Very impressive.

36:57.947 --> 37:00.983
Well... you know...

37:01.027 --> 37:04.527
We did not think your brains
had advanced even that far.

37:05.067 --> 37:07.190
How is it...

37:07.268 --> 37:10.304
...you know so much about our brains?

37:10.347 --> 37:13.300
We have studied your race closely.

37:14.704 --> 37:16.697
Ah...

37:21.023 --> 37:25.483
- What did you learn?
- That your species has great potential.

37:28.143 --> 37:30.135
Great potential...

37:30.222 --> 37:32.215
That's good.

37:32.302 --> 37:33.844
Understand this.

37:33.942 --> 37:37.726
There was once an alliance of
four great races in the galaxy.

37:38.539 --> 37:39.702
The Asgard.

37:39.818 --> 37:42.653
- The Nox.
- Met them.

37:42.699 --> 37:45.190
- The Furlings.
- Don't know them.

37:46.179 --> 37:47.672
And the ancients,...

37:47.777 --> 37:49.853
...the builders of the Stargates.

37:50.777 --> 37:52.936
That's a pretty heady group.

37:53.018 --> 37:55.472
The alliance was built
over many millennia.

37:55.538 --> 37:59.583
Your race has much to prove
before we may interact on that level.

38:02.054 --> 38:04.461
Uh...

38:06.253 --> 38:08.163
Uh...

38:10.054 --> 38:12.045
Look...

38:14.253 --> 38:17.539
You all seem to be quite... wonderful...

38:21.811 --> 38:23.472
...people.

38:26.250 --> 38:28.242
And...

38:28.329 --> 38:31.164
...I don't want to sound ungrateful...

38:31.210 --> 38:36.335
<i>.. because I really, really appreciate
you getting all that stuff out of my head.</i>

38:38.929 --> 38:41.253
But you folks should understand...

38:44.168 --> 38:46.375
...that we're out there now.

38:48.088 --> 38:50.838
And we might not be ready
for a lot of this stuff...

38:50.885 --> 38:52.960
...but we're doing the best we can.

38:56.563 --> 38:59.315
We are a very curious race.

39:26.478 --> 39:30.940
You have already taken the first steps
towards becoming... the fifth race.

39:38.478 --> 39:39.804
We'll have to shut the whole
system down and reboot.

39:39.804 --> 39:41.117
We'll have to shut the whole
system down and reboot.

39:41.235 --> 39:44.902
- Can you close the iris if necessary?
- Apparently not.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.157
That's not good.

39:47.235 --> 39:50.686
I don't care what you have to do.
I want control of this system back.

39:50.715 --> 39:53.086
Yes, sir. I'm trying.

40:01.672 --> 40:04.045
We have an incoming wormhole.

40:30.746 --> 40:33.913
Everything seems to be back online, sir,
including the iris.

40:33.945 --> 40:35.403
Good work, Captain.

40:42.545 --> 40:45.213
- I'm back.
- What happened?

40:47.222 --> 40:49.596
Do you still have
the knowledge of the ancients?

40:52.103 --> 40:54.510
Nope. Don't remember a thing!

40:58.661 --> 41:00.737
But you know that meaning of life stuff?

41:04.900 --> 41:06.976
I think we're gonna be all right.
