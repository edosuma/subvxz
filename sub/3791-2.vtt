01:34.011 --> 01:35.803
Why, Ari, why?

01:35.888 --> 01:39.098
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's 5:00 in the morning.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.683
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.351
I love it when you say "fuck. "
Say it again.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.687
Come on, E.
It's game day, buddy.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.564
Wake up.
This is our tradition.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.983
Only this time
we're playing for keeps.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.444
No Pixar squirrel
is going to stop us.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.237
It's number one
or bust, kid.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.115
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.366
So what are we
hoping for?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.869
$95 mil is what
they're projecting.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.247
- And what's good?
- $95 mil, Eric. That would be good.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.917
Expectations: You beat 'em
by a dollar... life is great,

02:06.001 --> 02:07.835
under by a dollar...
put a gun in your mouth

02:07.920 --> 02:09.586
and make sure
I'm standing behind you.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.672
Okay, keep in touch, Ari.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.638
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.431
You'll talk dirty to E...

02:20.516 --> 02:22.225
Come on.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.393
- It's been three weeks.
- I know, I know.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.604
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.068
And if we don't open?

02:33.821 --> 02:36.447
"If we don't open?"
What... no no no.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.825
"If we don't open?"
What do you mean by that?

02:38.909 --> 02:40.701
Would you say that to a fighter
on the morning of a bout?

02:40.786 --> 02:41.994
"Maybe you'll get
knocked out.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.412
"See you after the fight
if you're not in a coma"?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.331
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.754
Three soft-boiled eggs,

02:51.839 --> 02:54.799
boiled chicken,
wheat toast with jam.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.677
It's not a signature
Johnny Drama breakfast

02:57.761 --> 03:00.012
but there's nothing there
to upset your stomach.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.014
Thanks, Johnny,
but I'm not stressed.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.183
You're hiding it, bro.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.435
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed

03:06.520 --> 03:08.604
but trust me,
you are stressed.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.357
Moviefone says there's
a 2:30 in Northridge.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.025
The Valley?
What are you, crazy?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.194
It's gonna reach
100Â° in the city today.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.196
Vince wants to go to
an out-of-the-way place.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.033
Vince, you know my policy...
except for work,

03:21.118 --> 03:23.327
I only go to the Valley
November through March.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.079
And even then...
only the sushi row.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.581
Come on, Johnny,
go for me.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.959
I'd better hydrate.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.044
So what do you think
we're gonna open at, Vin?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.881
- Oh, God.
- Come on. I don't play this game.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.841
Come on, let's just fuck around
a little. Pick a number.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.510
- Stop freaking him out, Turtle.
- I'm not freaking out.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.013
I know we're gonna open.
It's a foregone conclusion.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.181
- I'm not worried about it.
- So pick a number.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.558
Okay.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.853
$50 million. Huh?

03:49.313 --> 03:51.814
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.233
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million,

03:54.318 --> 03:56.235
we're all working
at Del Taco come Monday.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.237
- So what do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.239
95? Nice.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.867
Fuck 95. I got a little
projection of my own.

04:04.328 --> 04:10.082
$114,844, 117.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.210
- How is that?
- $1 more than "Spiderman" made.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.838
We do any less than that I'll personally
consider the movie a flop.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.591
You're an idiot, Turtle. "Spiderman"
is the biggest movie opening ever.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.136
Plus Spiderman had a much bigger
fan base than Aquaman to begin with.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.013
Can't happen.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.683
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes. It can happen.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.435
You think we got a shot
to topple Spidey, E?

04:29.519 --> 04:31.312
Let's just topple 95,
huh, guys?

04:31.396 --> 04:34.357
I'll tell you what:
If we do beat "Spiderman"

04:34.691 --> 04:36.901
y'all are getting something sick.
Know that.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.612
- How sick?
- What do you mean by "sick"?

04:42.491 --> 04:44.742
It's not even 10:00 a. m.
And it's burning up out there.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.869
I know. My widget says
it's 96 already.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.205
What the fuck's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.165
Seriously, what, are you
wearing a butt plug?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.793
No. I brought you
this for luck

04:53.877 --> 04:54.961
on the opening today.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.380
What is this, a little
Tae Bo instructor?

04:57.881 --> 04:59.131
That is an authentic

04:59.216 --> 05:01.384
12th century Yong Shi
warrior, Ari.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.386
He's the Mongolian
symbol of strength.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.304
If you carry him,
you cannot be stopped.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.723
This is Hollywood, Lloyd.
The only thing Mongolian is barbeque,

05:07.808 --> 05:10.142
- but thanks. I'll take what I can get.
- Oh, and...

05:10.227 --> 05:12.061
I got you in
with Dr. Marcus at 4:30.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.146
Dr. Marcus?

05:14.231 --> 05:16.148
Um, yeah.
Your wife called

05:16.233 --> 05:17.942
and said she needed
an emergency session.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.153
Fuck, Lloyd, why didn't you
just tell her that I didn't have time?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.531
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.533
'Cause I'm scared
of your wife, Ari.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.660
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls

05:27.744 --> 05:29.328
she'll disappear.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.629
We're going to
the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.507
Hey, don't kid yourself, E.
North of Ventura Boulevard

05:41.591 --> 05:43.843
is Hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.219
If you keep drinking
we're gonna have to stop

05:45.303 --> 05:47.096
every 20' for you
to take a leak.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.140
That's what the empties are for.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.101
Don't even think about pulling
your dick out in my car, Drama.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.187
- Hey, Ari.
- "Aquaman" is making waves, pal.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.064
The first East Coast
numbers are in.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.984
They're projecting
$100 mil.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.527
Oh, that is great news.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.821
The movie gods
are smiling on us today.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.948
Well, it's still early.
We could do better, right?

06:06.450 --> 06:08.868
I thought I was greedy.
Listen, the over-and-under is 95.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.411
We hit 100...
I got wood.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.247
I'm just saying. I mean,
"Spiderman" did what, 114?

06:13.331 --> 06:15.291
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- "Spiderman"?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.044
Who... who's said
anything about "Spiderman"?

06:18.795 --> 06:19.879
Eric...

06:21.173 --> 06:22.256
tell me that Vinnie
doesn't think

06:22.340 --> 06:24.633
that we're gonna beat
the biggest opening in movie history.

06:25.761 --> 06:26.761
I'll tell you what:

06:26.845 --> 06:29.680
Manage your client's
expectations.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.308
Do your job. Thank you
for ruining my day.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.310
Ari?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.103
We all good?

06:36.188 --> 06:37.980
I thought you're not worried
about that stuff.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.523
I'm not.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.318
In fact, I don't wanna
know anything till it's official.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.862
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.782
103...

06:47.866 --> 06:50.618
My God.
104!

06:50.702 --> 06:52.495
Unbelievable.
Shit.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.622
- 105.
Eat that, Drama.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.166
- This is inhuman.
- I guess it's true what they say...

06:57.250 --> 06:58.834
the heat really does
affect the elderly.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.252
Yeah, seriously, Drama,
'cause I haven't seen

07:00.337 --> 07:02.838
somebody sweat like that
since Patrick Ewing retired.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.844
Great Mother of God.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
Fuck.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.602
Dude, we got
a monster, Vince.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.978
It's one theater.
Don't get crazy.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.188
How are we
gonna get seats?

07:19.648 --> 07:20.940
Who are you talking to?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.025
There's four taped off
for us in the back

07:23.110 --> 07:25.945
as we speak.
And all it cost us...

07:27.197 --> 07:29.156
was a signed copy
of the new Aquaman game.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.075
Nice job, Turtle.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.828
I'm making a run
for cooler pastures.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.581
Oh!

07:54.891 --> 07:56.100
What do you think?

07:57.269 --> 07:58.644
Oh, they're loving it.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.896
Wait till they get a load of the end
of this scene.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.441
Jesus Christ, where's
this jerkoff going?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.528
Hey, pal... you wanna sit down?
You're about to miss

08:07.612 --> 08:08.904
the best part
of the whole movie.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.115
I have to use
the bathroom.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.909
Sit down.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.154
I dropped my monkey!

08:50.238 --> 08:52.072
No, come back!

08:58.788 --> 09:00.080
Here it comes!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.887
- What the fuck?
- Shit, projector must have gone out.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.931
It's not just
the projector.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.516
We lost the central air.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.061
Waiting for
this movie two hours!

09:22.145 --> 09:25.773
Ahem, sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.442
Um, please calmly
file into the lobby

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
and we'll refund
your money.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.238
Whoa whoa.
Refund their money?

09:32.322 --> 09:34.365
They already saw
half the movie. Fuck that.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.076
Shut the fuck up!
- Give them free popcorn or something.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.249
Holy crap! Aquaman!

09:43.333 --> 09:44.750
Dude, what are you
doing here?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.752
Just checking out
the movie like you guys.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.754
Oh, but who's guarding
the throne of Poseidonis?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.798
It's about to be a madhouse in here.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.384
- I'm gonna go get the car, all right?
- Fire up the AC.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.262
The movie is great, Vince.
We caught the 10:00 a. m. Showing too.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.013
That harpoon fight
was badass.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.099
Did you hear that, E?
They thought I was badass.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.351
- I heard.
- Hey, so Vince, let me ask you...

10:02.435 --> 10:05.187
was that seahorse you rode
animatronic or computer generated?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.438
- E?
- Animatronic.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.649
- Animatronic.
- Yes! You owe me $20.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.943
That is him!

10:11.152 --> 10:14.488
- Oh my God!
Can I have your autograph, Vince?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.258
Whoo!
We made it.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.678
Now let's get back
to civilization. Please.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.271
I begged you to take the 101,

10:47.355 --> 10:48.981
but you had to take
the Canyon.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.984
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.695
All the lights are out, Drama.
What would you like me to do?

10:54.779 --> 10:57.239
You know, it looks
like the whole area is blacked out.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.950
I'm gonna call Ari.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.453
Hey, I was just dialing you.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.663
Hey. That must mean
that we're destined to be in love.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.707
Yeah. You're having a blackout
over there too?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.959
I haven't had a blackout
since I took four Quaaludes

11:09.044 --> 11:11.003
and forgot I fucked
Chantal Lautenberg. Why?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.422
'Cause we're in Northridge.
The whole area is blacked out.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.758
- Is this gonna affect the numbers?
- I didn't even know

11:15.842 --> 11:17.843
that Northridge survived
the '94 quake, E.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.012
Don't worry about that.
Listen, you with Vinnie?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.639
- Yeah.
- Okay, be very cool.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.477
Do not get him excited, but the first
West Coast numbers are in,

11:26.561 --> 11:28.562
- and they're big.
- Go on.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.482
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.233
The webcrawler is
in our sights, Eric,

11:33.318 --> 11:35.944
and I want to squash
that fucker!

11:36.071 --> 11:38.280
So do I, Ari.
All right, thanks.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.411
What?

11:47.957 --> 11:48.999
Nothing.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.834
Fuck you, "nothing. "
What is it?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.128
- Nothing until it's official, right?
- Fuck official.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.755
I don't want you to know
anything I don't.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.634
- Is it "Spiderman"?
- Spidey, E?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.677
- Say something, dick.
- E, speak now

12:00.762 --> 12:02.179
or I'm throwing you
out of the car.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.100
"Spiderman" is
in our sights.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.102
Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:08.186 --> 12:10.854
- Yes!
- I knew it! Fuck you, Tobey!

12:10.939 --> 12:13.399
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, no, I know.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.901
That's cool. Let's go buy some toys
anyway to celebrate.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.445
Yes.
- I know a place.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.698
But not in the Valley, right?
They got toys in the city, Vince.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.626
How do you know
this area, Turtle?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.337
Best rub-and-tug in California
used to be next door.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.257
Yeah, they probably moved
to Santa Monica where it's cool.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.842
There she is.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.886
Ducatis. Sweet.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.932
This is the one
for me, Vince,

12:47.016 --> 12:49.351
the fastest production bike
on the road.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.019
It's yours. E?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.272
I appreciate it, Vince,
but I'm not a motorcycle guy,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.357
and I'm not gonna take
a gift just to take one.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.609
You neither, Johnny?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.611
You know I hate
rice rockets, Vince.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.946
Ducati's Italian,
Drama.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.990
Yeah, well, regardless

13:03.074 --> 13:05.325
it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.244
Yeah, didn't you have one
when you first came out here?

13:07.537 --> 13:09.329
Yeah, I had to hock it
to Michael Madsen

13:09.414 --> 13:13.041
after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.
God, I loved that bike.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.501
Why don't we go
over there tomorrow

13:14.586 --> 13:17.212
- and make him an offer he can't refuse?
- You serious?

13:19.883 --> 13:22.134
God, you're
a fucking prince, bro.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.678
You know, he's also
got a watch of mine.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.681
Mr. Chase, have you
decided yet?

13:27.765 --> 13:29.391
Yes, we have.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.393
We'll take
four of these.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.687
Maybe you guys
will grow to love 'em.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.815
Not again.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.859
So when is the last time
you had sex?

13:38.943 --> 13:42.154
- With each other or?
- If you're not taking this seriously...

13:42.238 --> 13:44.114
I'm taking it seriously.
It's just for the money

13:44.199 --> 13:45.824
we're spending here
I could get you a pro

13:45.909 --> 13:47.993
to service your even most
bizarre fetishes.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.786
Okay, you see?
This is what I'm dealing with.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.330
Come on.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.706
Don't.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.958
- It's Vince.
Ari...

13:55.084 --> 13:56.627
...don't you feel

13:56.711 --> 13:58.504
that a lacking
sexual relationship

13:58.588 --> 14:00.380
is a big problem
in a marriage?

14:00.465 --> 14:02.341
Oh, I do, Doc,
but we fuck

14:02.425 --> 14:04.468
more than any other
married couple you know.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.387
And I know this
because whenever we go out

14:07.472 --> 14:09.681
with another married couple
and the subject comes up

14:09.766 --> 14:12.684
they always say, "I can't believe
how often you guys fuck. "

14:20.026 --> 14:21.944
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.946
Okay... you know, uh,

14:24.030 --> 14:25.614
after the year
that I've had

14:25.698 --> 14:27.533
and on the most important
day of my life you'd think

14:27.617 --> 14:30.118
that she would ask me
what I wanted, you know?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.912
A nice blowjob, perhaps,

14:31.996 --> 14:35.082
where I could just sit back
for the first time in nine months

14:35.166 --> 14:36.959
and do nothing but
admire the top of her head

14:37.043 --> 14:39.878
and pray that this
fucking movie opens

14:39.963 --> 14:41.630
so I can stop selling off assets

14:41.756 --> 14:43.549
Like we're fucking
Michael Jackson.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.634
Now I have to answer
the fucking Batphone

14:45.718 --> 14:49.471
when it rings three fucking times
and it's fucking Vince, okay? So...

14:50.473 --> 14:52.224
- Eric, speak.
Ari...

14:52.308 --> 14:54.560
There's been another blackout
in a different part of the Valley.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.229
You need a fucking night-light or
something? Get back over the hill, okay?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.605
And don't call me
back unless...

14:59.482 --> 15:00.899
Fuck me.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.485
- What's going on, Ari?
- I'm gonna call you back.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.781
Can we prorate
this session, please?

15:12.870 --> 15:15.247
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?

15:15.456 --> 15:17.708
- Hey, Aquaman.
Oh, great.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.668
We're being stalked
by Devo.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.255
- This isn't a coincidence, is it?
- No, we followed you.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.257
- Replenish.
- We, uh, wanted to know

15:25.341 --> 15:26.883
if you guys wanted
to come to a party.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.552
It's our big
graduation bash.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.013
High school party?
Sorry, kid,

15:31.097 --> 15:33.599
we don't go to the parties where
the girls ain't legal.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.393
Although we do like 'em
barely legal.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.479
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like "Almost Famous. "

15:39.564 --> 15:42.482
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up out here.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.568
Another hour and my kidneys
may shut down.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.736
They've got a pool.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.989
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.116
And it'll be a lot easier to get in
with you there, Vince.

15:51.826 --> 15:55.120
So that's it? You guys need Vince
to get you into the party.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.246
What are you
laughing at, Turtle?

15:56.331 --> 15:58.290
You still can't get into
Teddy's without Vince.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.916
Do you wanna go?

16:00.001 --> 16:02.085
Fuck it. It's gonna take hours
to get home anyway, right?

16:02.170 --> 16:03.253
So you'll come?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.506
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!

16:06.591 --> 16:09.343
Aquaman to the rescue!

16:21.731 --> 16:23.231
- Hey, girl.
- Hey!

16:29.614 --> 16:31.657
Did kids look this young
when we went to high school?

16:31.741 --> 16:34.618
- In Drama's eighth year they did, yes.
- Six years, assholes.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.204
And just like I did for these maggots
I'm gonna do for you guys.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.207
Someone gives you guys a hard time
about being here...

16:40.583 --> 16:42.167
Johnny Drama's
got your back.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.920
Thanks. There are some really
tough kids at this school.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.422
Come on,
I'm from New York.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.591
Who the fuck let
nerds in my house?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.885
Here we go.
Jesus...

16:51.969 --> 16:53.804
Drama's gonna get
his ass kicked by a 16-year-old.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.889
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?

16:56.265 --> 16:58.975
- These guys are with us.
- Yeah? Who the fuck are you?

16:59.060 --> 17:02.437
Uh, he's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.439
we saw the party,
we figured we'd drop in.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.858
Whoa whoa, holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.276
You're with these two?

17:09.444 --> 17:10.820
Jay and Reggie?
Yeah, they're my cousins.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.989
But hey, it's cool.
We'll find another party.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.700
Oh, no no no no.
No, you stay.

17:14.784 --> 17:18.119
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.372
Uh, you need a beer, Vince?

17:20.455 --> 17:21.623
That'd be good.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.834
Thanks.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.627
Holy shit, Vince Chase.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.628
Hey everyone,

17:27.714 --> 17:29.881
fuckin' Aquaman
is at my house!

17:33.302 --> 17:34.803
Give me
something good, Ari.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.723
There's nothing good at all, E.
Nothing good.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.850
- Why? What's happening?
- There are massive

17:39.934 --> 17:42.686
rolling blackouts
from the heat.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.730
They're hitting
the whole fucking coast

17:44.814 --> 17:46.773
from San Francisco
down to San Diego.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.193
Shit. Well, I guess we can kiss
"Spiderman" goodbye.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.195
Forget "Spiderman. "
I just named

17:52.280 --> 17:55.157
two of the most populated
cities in the whole fucking country.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.909
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- It means that we are fucked.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.995
We took a massive hit
on the midday numbers

18:00.079 --> 18:02.998
and now they are
projecting 85.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.042
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?

18:06.127 --> 18:08.503
Same thing you've been
telling him all day... nothing!

18:08.588 --> 18:10.589
Keep your mouth shut
until it's official.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.176
- Yeah, when's that gonna be?
- In a few hours, all right?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.178
I want you to email me
your address

18:16.262 --> 18:19.347
and I will come and tell him with you,
all right?

18:21.058 --> 18:22.601
Lloyd!

18:25.146 --> 18:27.147
What happened to the music?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.983
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!

18:39.160 --> 18:40.952
Yeah, our moms say
Reggie looked

18:41.037 --> 18:43.288
exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.166
A little, I guess.
And you're related to Jay too?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.168
Oh, we're practically
like brothers.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.462
You girls should
take care of these two.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.047
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want anything?

18:52.590 --> 18:53.715
All good, Vince.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.926
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
- Jay.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.805
Ha-ha!
Life is good, huh?

19:00.515 --> 19:01.473
Any word?

19:01.557 --> 19:04.226
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?

19:25.957 --> 19:29.000
How is this possible? An hour ago
we're the biggest opening ever

19:29.085 --> 19:31.878
- and now we're a disaster?
- Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.880
Fucking blackouts.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.132
See, this is why I don't like to get
caught up in this shit.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.926
You shouldn't let me
get caught up in it, E.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.595
- Vince, come on.
- I know, I know. I asked.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.265
I'm sorry, buddy.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.599
Yeah.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.478
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.981
Remember how we used to talk
about coming out to Hollywood?

19:51.065 --> 19:53.024
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.528
Fuck it. We're not gonna let this town
make it about money now.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.114
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.992
- We'll make their night.
- All right.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.368
ARl: Blackouts?!

20:04.161 --> 20:05.829
Fucking blackouts?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.499
Thank you very much!

20:10.751 --> 20:13.712
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.089
Baby, it wasn't
the Cubs' fault

20:16.173 --> 20:17.883
when that douche bag
grabbed the foul ball either,

20:17.967 --> 20:19.551
but they still don't get
a World Series ring.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.847
There are no asterisks in this life,
only scoreboards,

20:23.931 --> 20:27.058
and ours is currently
reading "Fucked. "

20:27.143 --> 20:29.227
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it now,

20:29.312 --> 20:31.187
so why don't you
sit down and relax?

20:31.272 --> 20:34.399
Baby, I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.067
After the call.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.403
And who knows
when that will be?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.405
Baby, isn't it
a little convenient

20:40.489 --> 20:41.907
that the kids are
at your mother's?

20:41.991 --> 20:44.451
Ari, I've been patient,
but now

20:44.535 --> 20:46.620
whatever happens is totally out
of your control.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.122
So let's go upstairs.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.584
Fine, but I'm not
gonna like it.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.669
Oh really?

20:58.174 --> 21:00.592
All right, I may like it
just a little bit.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.886
Oh.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.304
Baby, I don't want you to hear this.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.765
I could cry. I have to go to the Valley.
I promise you

21:06.849 --> 21:08.433
when I get back,
no matter what,

21:08.517 --> 21:10.268
we're gonna dent that headboard.
No bullshit.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.437
I guarantee you you will not
walk right tomorrow.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.982
Tell me something good.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.401
Vince, Vince,
Vince, Vince!

21:27.244 --> 21:29.746
- So you work with Vince?
- Yep.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.748
- Is it fun?
- Yep.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.625
You don't talk much, huh?

21:33.709 --> 21:36.044
Not to high school girls,
sweetheart. No offense.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.463
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.465
I'm just chaperoning.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.925
Oh-hh.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.178
Ew. That was
a real creepy turn.

21:56.607 --> 21:59.275
You may have
a couple pounds on me

21:59.360 --> 22:01.111
but nothing outweighs
experience.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.570
You ready?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.573
Are you ready?

22:27.430 --> 22:28.930
Hey, everybody!

22:29.932 --> 22:32.767
Do you know how good
your lives are right now?

22:33.102 --> 22:34.144
Yeah!

22:39.400 --> 22:41.151
My boys are here
from high school

22:41.235 --> 22:43.778
and we wish we could be back
living like this!

22:44.113 --> 22:45.280
Yeah!

22:48.576 --> 22:50.285
What the fuck
is he doing?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.911
He wanted his
"Almost Famous" moment.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.330
ARl: I told you not to tell him anything
until it was official.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.207
Aw, what the fuck
is the difference, Ari?

22:57.626 --> 22:58.960
Hey, Vinnie!

23:01.547 --> 23:04.299
Ari is in the Valley?

23:05.092 --> 23:07.594
Holy shit, we really
must be fucked, huh?

23:08.304 --> 23:10.638
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?

23:11.015 --> 23:13.016
- 116, actually.
- What?

23:13.726 --> 23:16.144
- 116, kid!
How's that possible?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.605
You guys ever hear
of a hanging chad?

23:20.941 --> 23:22.358
Where the fuck am I?
Listen,

23:22.443 --> 23:24.444
the biggest thing
the blackouts affected

23:24.820 --> 23:26.780
were the actual
reporting of the numbers.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.951
- We beat "Spiderman"?
- Well, it's only Friday,

23:32.036 --> 23:34.037
but if there isn't
a tornado in the Midwest

23:34.121 --> 23:36.289
I think we've got a good
goddamn shot, my friend.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.291
Hey, everybody,
you've got the biggest

23:38.375 --> 23:41.377
movie star on the planet
on your roof right now.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.758
It's all you, baby!

23:52.848 --> 23:54.933
- Number one, baby.
Yeah! Do it!

24:02.691 --> 24:04.192
So whose dad is this?

24:04.819 --> 24:06.611
I don't know. Why don't you
throw him in the pool?

24:06.695 --> 24:08.363
Fuck you, "throw me
in the pool. "

24:08.447 --> 24:10.406
Hey, Kong, go get us
some beers.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.619
- Put him in! Put him in!
- Go go!

24:20.543 --> 24:21.626
Hey, you little fuck,

24:21.710 --> 24:23.670
these are $900 shoes!

24:25.047 --> 24:27.632
Okay, you guys are not
gonna believe this!

24:27.716 --> 24:28.842
Those two girls
you introduced us to?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.177
The most untouchable
girls in school. But guess what...

24:31.262 --> 24:32.637
They like you.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.681
They wanna hang
in my basement.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.600
Basement! Nice!

24:38.018 --> 24:40.061
The only problem is,
we can't all fit on the Vespa.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.939
You can't roll chicks
in a Vespa, bro.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.316
Well, we were hoping
maybe you could give us a lift.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.776
- A lift?
Yeah, right.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.778
I can't do that.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.780
But what I can do
is this:

24:50.865 --> 24:52.907
Turtle, give our
new best friends

24:52.992 --> 24:55.410
- the keys to the Mas'.
- There you go.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.496
Oh, that is so cool!
You're lending us your car?

24:58.581 --> 25:01.040
- No no no.
- How do we get it back to you?

25:01.125 --> 25:02.500
You don't.
You return it

25:02.585 --> 25:04.961
to the Beverly Hills
Maserati dealership.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.297
Your lease ends
at the end of August.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.674
- No way.
- Holy shit.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.301
ARl: That was actually
refreshing,

25:11.385 --> 25:13.511
but I have to go home
to hammer the wife.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.513
Give us a lift.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.850
Anything to keep me away
from my house. Come on, bro.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.602
We out.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.103
Aw.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.149
Yeah, the Valley
ain't so bad.
