Previously on Transformers Prime

00:03.600 --> 00:05.160
Bravo, Optimus.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.690
You may wish to save
your strength for the main event.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.240
We need to find Fowler and
get this kids out of here.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.770
It's your fault that
we're stuck in this intensity.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.300
What were you thinking, Miko?

00:15.330 --> 00:16.830
I know math when I see it.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.340
And that is one serious equation.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.580
Well, if this was just
an average day with the Autobots...

00:21.620 --> 00:23.550
then I don't wanna be
a part of it.

00:23.580 --> 00:27.180
Your mindless agenda resulted
in the disassembling of my ship!

00:27.220 --> 00:29.680
And the delay of my plans!

00:30.610 --> 00:33.160
Megatron is building
a Space Bridge

00:33.200 --> 00:35.820
to bring through
his conquering army.

00:35.860 --> 00:38.070
But the only place Megatron could

00:38.110 --> 00:41.980
recruit
that many fallen warriors...

00:42.430 --> 00:43.930
Cybertron.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.720
We cannot allow Megatron

00:55.760 --> 00:58.850
to send Dark Energon
through his Space Bridge.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.420
If we fail, the dead
of Cybertron will rise.

01:07.490 --> 01:09.570
Swarm through its vortex...

01:11.020 --> 01:12.810
and invade Earth.

01:13.280 --> 01:17.720
Bending human kind to
Megatron's twisted rule.

Nice bike.

01:54.390 --> 01:57.190
Arcee, really. Miko already tried.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.240
Tell Optimus
I respect him big time, but...

02:00.490 --> 02:02.380
if you're at war
with the Decepticons...

02:02.870 --> 02:04.690
there's nothing
I can do to help.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.690
Optimus didn't send me,
and no one's asking for your help.

02:07.940 --> 02:12.020
OK, so, if we both agree
that I'm not warrior material...

02:12.300 --> 02:15.390
Jack, I just lost
someone I cared about...

02:15.890 --> 02:19.430
maybe it's the grief talking,
maybe you're growing on me.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.130
Whatever it is...
I'm just not ready to say good-bye.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.060
Optimus, I've pinpointed the
location of Megatron's Space Bridge.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.680
High in Earth's orbit.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.680
Out of our reach.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.720
Ok, so you guys don't fly...

02:36.860 --> 02:38.590
but can't you just
ground-bridge there?

02:39.030 --> 02:41.960
The Ground Bridge
has limited range.

02:42.140 --> 02:45.340
Stretch all the way into
orbit its vortex could snap.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.340
And scatter us to the stars.

02:49.070 --> 02:52.130
Since Megatron is likely
already in transit,

02:52.530 --> 02:55.060
I'm afraid we must take that risk.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.640
Reaching the Space Bridge first

02:57.810 --> 03:00.570
is our only means of stopping him.

03:07.890 --> 03:10.200
Hey, guess who's back!

03:10.560 --> 03:13.310
Autobots, prepare for departure.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.210
- Where to?
- The final frontier.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.210
Space?

03:21.390 --> 03:23.790
I thought they didn't
have any way to get there

03:23.920 --> 03:25.740
They don't, really.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.230
Be seen you?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.260
Be careful, 'Bee.

03:40.970 --> 03:45.450
- I'm so jealous.
- Don't even think about following me.

03:45.590 --> 03:48.740
Optimus, if you leave me
stranded on a planet

03:48.830 --> 03:52.070
teaming with humans,
I will never forgive you.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.960
Until we meet
again, old friend.

03:56.380 --> 03:59.080
Autobots, roll out!

04:10.270 --> 04:12.180
Maximum overdrive!

04:17.820 --> 04:20.440
Autobots, transform...

04:21.589 --> 04:23.410
...and gravitize.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.050
Don't look down. Or up.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.290
Or left.

04:44.770 --> 04:47.390
So Megatron's packing
enough Dark Energon

04:47.480 --> 04:49.430
to raise Cybertron's dead?

04:50.140 --> 04:54.360
And since we don't possess ready
means of disabling the Space Bridge,

04:55.160 --> 04:58.400
nothing gets in... or out!

05:01.550 --> 05:05.280
Optimus Prime
never disappoints.

05:06.220 --> 05:09.370
Unlike you, Starscream.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.390
No need for
concern, Master.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.630
Soundwave is locking on to
Cybertron's coordinates...

05:15.980 --> 05:18.870
...per my instructions.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.950
Well, what are they waiting for?

05:32.590 --> 05:35.920
It appears the Decepticons have
sustained serious damage

05:36.010 --> 05:38.320
to their interstellar
navigation system.

05:39.290 --> 05:43.020
- Uh, that's my handiwork.
- Great job, Bulkhead.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.950
Without the dish, Megatron
would be unable

05:46.040 --> 05:48.220
to aim the Space Bridge at Cybertron.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.930
Don't the Decepticons know
where their own planet is?

05:51.060 --> 05:52.210
Naturally.

05:52.390 --> 05:54.790
But Cybertron is
many light years away.

05:54.970 --> 05:56.030
To reach their target,

05:56.120 --> 05:59.010
their aim must be
astronomically precise.

05:59.270 --> 06:03.140
If Megatron went to the travel
of rendezvousing with his Space Bridge,

06:03.490 --> 06:06.510
he must have an
alternate targeting system.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.200
A remote one.

06:09.350 --> 06:10.990
From what I know of
Earth's technology,

06:11.080 --> 06:14.100
I doubt there exists
a single radio-telescope dish

06:14.190 --> 06:17.430
on this planet powerful
enough to pinpoint Cybertron.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.850
What about a whole bunch
of linked radio-telescope dishes?

06:21.070 --> 06:23.470
Like the giant sized
array in Texas?

06:23.600 --> 06:27.070
Shh! This is not child's play.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.060
Good thinking, Raf.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.420
Ratchet, have agent Fowler

06:31.460 --> 06:34.300
alert the array staff
to the security hazard.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.720
You, soldier!
You on the uniform!

06:38.030 --> 06:39.900
Put on some pants!

06:41.410 --> 06:43.230
That may be a challenge.

06:45.090 --> 06:47.310
I can't get past
the array's firewalls.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.560
They're too thick.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.330
You actually think you could
keep the Decepticons out?

06:52.680 --> 06:55.700
Maybe, if I could get in.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.100
W-wait, Raf, what if we
could get you all the way in?

07:00.190 --> 07:01.920
Like 'inside-the-building' in?

07:02.050 --> 07:05.380
I could log into their intern network
on the other side of the firewall.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.560
The risk is too great,
the Decepticons would be there.

07:09.650 --> 07:11.950
Perhaps even on sight.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.510
Optimus, with all due respect...

07:15.680 --> 07:19.770
you said it yourself, this is bigger
than the safety of three humans.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.080
Yeah, if we let
the 'Cons win,

07:22.120 --> 07:25.180
we are fried, along with
everyone else on our planet.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.540
Raf?

07:30.420 --> 07:31.980
I wanna give it a shot.

07:32.200 --> 07:38.280
Surely, Lord Megatron,
the Autobots are... up to something.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.700
Reeeaally, Starscream?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.070
Crush them!

07:51.780 --> 07:53.870
Here comes the welcoming committee.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.370
That would take
some getting used to.

08:42.530 --> 08:45.440
Security sure is lax
on this place.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.240
I'm in.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.570
And so are the Decepticons.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.470
- What?!
- How can you tell?

08:51.610 --> 08:52.630
Schematics.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.210
With the same alien math
we saw on their ship.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.740
But this time,
I can download it.

08:59.050 --> 09:01.040
It's gotta be the Space Bridge.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.470
The Decepticons are
syncing it to the dishes

09:03.670 --> 09:06.290
- But I can sync in them.
- Would they know?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.160
Even if the Decepticons
see that I'm in the system,

09:09.300 --> 09:11.340
they have no idea I'm in the house.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.810
What just happened?

09:42.060 --> 09:45.750
The Decepticons are
locking on to Cybertron.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.290
Lord Megatron, the Space Bridge
is ready for activation.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.090
Finally!

09:53.670 --> 09:56.490
They're locked on to Cybertron,
but not for long.

10:06.790 --> 10:11.110
Indeed, Bumblebee.
This can only be Raf's doing.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.100
Starscream! What is happening?

10:16.610 --> 10:19.130
Soundwave! What is happening?

10:25.060 --> 10:27.880
The dishes are heading
back towards Cybertron.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.160
I won't let them do that again.

10:32.790 --> 10:34.340
What happens
when the 'Cons realize

10:34.390 --> 10:35.360
they are been punk?

10:35.510 --> 10:39.010
It's only virtual combat,
you know, like on-line gaming.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.830
Yeah, Jack, what are
the 'Cons gonna do?

10:41.920 --> 10:44.740
They're probably like
a thousand miles away.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.700
I won't let them
lock on again.

11:22.790 --> 11:24.880
You handed it an axe?!

11:24.980 --> 11:26.190
Not good...

11:49.810 --> 11:51.360
Why is he leaving?

11:53.160 --> 11:54.570
He has cut the hard-line.

11:54.810 --> 11:57.000
The dishes are
locked on to Cybertron.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.330
For good.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.770
Now, Starscream?

12:07.010 --> 12:08.130
Now.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.870
At last!

13:02.750 --> 13:05.860
Arise, my legion!

13:24.660 --> 13:28.500
So, how do we beat a
whole planet of the undead?

13:28.750 --> 13:32.540
Optimus, I'm registering
a rapidly expanding mass

13:32.630 --> 13:34.190
in their Space Bridge vortex.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.860
One with a peculiar
energy signature.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.660
Dark Energon.

13:38.950 --> 13:42.110
Ratchet, we must
destroy the Space Bridge.

13:43.570 --> 13:46.340
There's enough live
energon cursing through it

13:46.430 --> 13:48.140
to achieve detonation.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.910
But we lack the
firepower to ignite it.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.480
If I knew how the
Space Bridge was engineered,

13:53.580 --> 13:56.450
I might find a tactical way
of accomplishing that feat.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.780
Hm... would schematics help?

13:59.990 --> 14:01.690
Optimus, I must say...

14:02.080 --> 14:03.980
...the Space Bridge is
our sole hope

14:04.030 --> 14:05.680
of ever returning
to Cybertron.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.320
Are you certain it's
destruction is the only option?

14:09.760 --> 14:13.700
- I am afraid so.
- Then by all means...

14:13.940 --> 14:16.610
...let us light our darkest hour.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.310
Autobots, take your positions,

14:20.450 --> 14:22.390
and follow Ratchet's lead.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.060
While I make my stand.

14:35.370 --> 14:38.530
Your fellow Autobots
are wise, Optimus.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.050
They know when to retreat.

14:41.350 --> 14:45.530
I hold no illusions about
engaging your army, Megatron.

14:45.870 --> 14:48.490
But I might derail it's objective...

14:48.880 --> 14:51.210
...by removing it's head.

14:54.710 --> 14:59.960
Highly unlikely, Optimus, as I am
infused of the very might!

15:00.300 --> 15:04.280
One shall stand, one shall fall.

15:31.980 --> 15:34.120
These things are getting closer.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.400
That's bad, right?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.540
Ratchet, we're in position.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.600
Arcee, pay close attention.

16:06.820 --> 16:07.990
Master?

16:08.180 --> 16:10.420
Starscream, what is it?!

16:10.660 --> 16:13.680
I do not wish to question
your all-seeing wisdom,

16:13.870 --> 16:16.740
but I believe the Autobots
are up to something again.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.070
Beneath your bridge this time.

16:19.460 --> 16:25.480
Ah, misdirection, Optimus?
You would had made a fine Decepticon.

16:28.740 --> 16:31.700
I chose my side.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.870
Starscream, my
army approaches.

16:45.940 --> 16:48.480
Rendevouz with the
Space Bridge for pick-up.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.680
Now follow the line from
the flow regulator

16:51.720 --> 16:54.350
to the energon pump.
There should be a valve.

16:55.030 --> 16:55.950
I see it.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.790
Good. To turn all that
power against itself,

17:00.030 --> 17:02.190
all you need to do
is reverse the current.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.020
Current reversed.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.700
Yes! ... Right?

17:11.990 --> 17:14.079
I'll ready the Ground Bridge.

17:49.310 --> 17:52.420
Starscream, where is my ship?!

17:53.580 --> 17:56.010
We would never make it,
Lord Megatron.

17:56.110 --> 17:59.460
Don't be a fool!
Take flight and retreat!

18:01.650 --> 18:04.660
Optimus, the Ground Bridge
is ready and waiting.

18:05.390 --> 18:07.430
Autobots, jump!

18:24.150 --> 18:25.460
My legion...

18:32.120 --> 18:33.480
No...!

18:46.840 --> 18:48.250
Decepticons...

18:48.500 --> 18:53.400
...it is with deep sorrow,
that I note for the log...

18:53.650 --> 18:58.940
...Megatron's spark
has been extinguished.

19:00.110 --> 19:04.390
All hail Starscream!

19:08.910 --> 19:10.990
Do you... think they're...?

19:11.530 --> 19:12.990
Four life signals.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.130
One vary faint...

19:28.100 --> 19:29.220
Bulkhead!

19:49.430 --> 19:51.230
We lost one this week,

19:51.330 --> 19:54.150
by the Allspark,
don't let it be two.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.380
Arcee...

20:03.770 --> 20:05.660
Jack, really...?

20:06.300 --> 20:08.770
There are other motorcycles in the world.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.400
But you're my first.

20:11.830 --> 20:13.290
And Megatron?

20:14.120 --> 20:17.670
Not even he could
have survived ground-zero.

20:17.960 --> 20:18.930
Prime!

20:20.970 --> 20:23.400
I didn't get to thank you,
'Bots, for the save.

20:23.550 --> 20:24.570
I owe you one.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.340
We all do.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.290
So... is this the part
where you say good-bye and...

20:39.530 --> 20:42.110
and tell us we need
to forget we ever saw you?

20:44.930 --> 20:47.600
Without of means
of leaving this world...

20:47.940 --> 20:51.880
...we Autobots take strength
in the bonds we have forged

20:52.020 --> 20:54.310
with our three young friends.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.880
True warriors.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.830
If not in body...

20:59.600 --> 21:01.690
...then, in spirit.

21:01.980 --> 21:04.510
My name is Optimus Prime,

21:04.750 --> 21:06.840
and I send this message:

21:07.280 --> 21:10.100
though we did not choose
to be of Earth,

21:10.340 --> 21:13.210
it would seem that
we are here to stay.

21:13.450 --> 21:16.760
If you approach this planet
with hostile intent,

21:16.950 --> 21:18.170
know this...

21:18.800 --> 21:21.180
...we will defend ourselves.

21:21.620 --> 21:24.630
We will defend humanity.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.420
We will defend... our home.

21:31.770 --> 21:34.200
