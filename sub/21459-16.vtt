00:02.794 --> 00:05.463
{\an8}(Canvas)
From the moment
I rolled into Siesta Key...

00:05.547 --> 00:06.881
{\an7}(Chloe)
This is Canvas.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.173
{\an8}...I was making waves.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.092
{\an8}Oh, Canvas is gonna
get me in trouble.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.386
(Canvas)
I'll be the first to admit...

00:11.469 --> 00:12.637
All I do is trouble.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.931
...I didn't make
the best first impression.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.850
You'd better keep an eye
on Brandon and Canvas.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.894
{\an5}(Canvas)
But at the same time, this
whole crew was just as messy.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.479
{\an5}(Chloe)
Did you know that Garrett
and Juliette broke up?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.106
(Madisson)
Of course they did.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.441
{\an5}(Kelsey)
She's been cheating
on Garrett forever.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.025
{\an1}You deserve a lot better
than all of that.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.777
{\an5}(Carson)
I've seen worse
but I've seen a lot better.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.196
{\an5}(Kelsey)
How many girls do you
go skimboarding with?

00:30.280 --> 00:33.450
{\an5}(Canvas)
And nobody's friendships
were as perfect as they seemed.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.784
{\an1}You know how I feel
about Alex.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.327
I'm not gonna live my life
to please you.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.122
{\an1}Who wants a reaction where
everyone dislikes you?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.332
That is her.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.834
{\an1}Whatever happened in the past
between you and I,

00:42.917 --> 00:44.461
like, I truly am sorry for it.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.629
(Canvas)
Plus, let's not forget,

00:46.713 --> 00:49.007
Brandon was sending vibes
my way too.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.342
But the closer
I got to everyone...

00:51.426 --> 00:55.388
{\an5}I don't want to have
this conversation again,
so step off.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.807
...the more I realized,
maybe I should step off.

00:59.058 --> 01:02.937
But that didn't stop Brandon
from screwing Madisson over...

01:03.021 --> 01:04.355
Let's go this way.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.649
...and I was the only person
that saw it go down.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.485
{\an1}She definitely
deserves to know.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.069
I saw him leave with a girl.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.279
Why would you tell me this?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.489
(Canvas)
I know what it looks like...

01:12.572 --> 01:13.656
We are not friends.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.242
...but, come on,
he was a cheater.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.744
This one's on him.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.829
{\an1}Why would you tell me
you love me when you don't?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.539
{\an1}I do!

01:19.913 --> 01:21.539
{\an3}Oh, my God!

01:21.623 --> 01:23.792
{\an5}(Canvas)
I really was trying
to do the right thing,

01:23.875 --> 01:25.502
but before anyone
would see that,

01:25.585 --> 01:26.836
I'd cause a bigger mess

01:26.920 --> 01:29.589
that would make Madisson
hate me even more.

I just, like, wouldn't

{\an1}to, like-- obviously,
after everything

05:31.247 --> 05:32.457
{\an1}that had happened already,
um, I'm not trying

{\an1}to, like, get into

05:34.292 --> 05:36.127
{\an4}or anything,
you know?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.127
Yeah, you don't want

05:36.210 --> 05:38.921
{\an5}I'm single, man, yeah.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.921
Yeah, don't set yourself
up for that again.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.007
{\an5}Yeah, I don't want to.

You can't trust
that girl anymore, dude.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.759
{\an1}But at the same time,
we have, like,

05:42.842 --> 05:44.510
{\an5}that sexual connection...

05:42.842 --> 05:44.510
{\an3}Right.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.928
{\an1}...where she knows
what I like.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.513
You know, I know
what she likes.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.098

05:47.597 --> 05:49.098

07:14.767 --> 07:17.186
{\an7}I messed up.
I, uh...

07:17.270 --> 07:18.479
What happened?

07:20.606 --> 07:21.566
What happened?

07:21.649 --> 07:22.441
{\an1}Um...
I don't know.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.986
{\an1}The performance was going
really good,

07:25.069 --> 07:29.031
{\an1}and, um, I don't know.
I just, uh...

07:29.115 --> 07:31.784
{\an4}Madisson wasn't there
'cause she was in New York.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.784
{\an3}Right.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.536
{\an1}Um, and...

07:33.619 --> 07:37.165
{\an1}I ended up going home
with another girl,

07:37.248 --> 07:40.001
{\an1}and I regret
that I even did it, but...

07:40.084 --> 07:41.127
I cheated on her.

07:42.461 --> 07:44.547
You know my opinion
on cheating.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.341
If you're gonna be
committed to somebody,

07:47.425 --> 07:49.010
then you need to be
committed with somebody,

07:49.093 --> 07:51.012
and that's a whole lot
that I'm sure

07:51.095 --> 07:53.222
is going through Madisson's
head right now. A whole lot.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.016
{\an1}Yeah, I know. That's why
I want to talk to her.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.727
But is this a mistake or is
this part of your character?

07:57.810 --> 08:01.939
{\an1}It was literally just a...
a mistake,

08:02.023 --> 08:03.733
but I don't care
about that girl.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.067
{\an1}I regret
being with that girl.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.361
{\an1}I would tell Madisson that
a thousand times,

08:07.445 --> 08:09.864
{\an4}but it doesn't help out
with the situation.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.864
So that's...

08:09.947 --> 08:10.907
It still happened.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.283
And that's what she's

08:12.366 --> 08:13.743
gonna have to figure out,
and the only one

08:13.826 --> 08:16.037
that can let her
know that for sure is you.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.916
{\an1}I want to just make sure that
she knows that I care about her.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.209
I did not mean to do that.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.210
{\an1}But she's not
answering the phone.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.004
{\an5}She won't talk to me.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.004
Do not accept the fact

08:25.087 --> 08:27.173
{\an1}that she's not even
picking up your phone calls.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.216
I don't care what you
have to do, Brandon.

08:28.299 --> 08:32.929
Find her and let her
know that you're sorry.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.431
{\an5}(Alex)
My thought on the whole
cheating thing,

08:35.514 --> 08:37.265
it's like, I've done it,
obviously,

08:37.350 --> 08:42.520
and I've lost, you know,
people, you being one.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.441
You don't deserve it
and it sucks.

08:45.524 --> 08:49.737
But I know this
couch potato thing

08:49.820 --> 08:51.530
feels right right now,
but...

08:51.614 --> 08:53.616
{\an1}it's not
what's best for you.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.827
So, I'm taking out
my boat.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.412
Haven't been on it
in a while.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.121
I think it'd be good
for you,

08:59.205 --> 09:01.415
get your mind off of it.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.625
I don't know, Alex.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.502
{\an1}It might be weird
hanging out with Juliette.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.379
Yeah, she'll be there.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.881
{\an1}Like, on the same boat.
Like, that would...

09:08.965 --> 09:10.591
{\an5}Should I get two boats?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.591
(both laugh)

09:10.675 --> 09:13.261
You should come out.
Juliette's cool.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.681
Hiding behind this blanket
is not good long-term.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.223
{\an1}(chuckles)

09:17.306 --> 09:20.810
So, will you come?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.395
Not this time.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.646
Think about it.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.064

10:12.778 --> 10:14.905
{\an4}with my old car,
the Mustang.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.905
The Mustang.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.073
{\an5}Yeah, the 'Stang.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.073

10:20.077 --> 10:22.330
we have so many
memories in that car.

10:22.413 --> 10:26.042
{\an1}I remember the first time you
ever came over to my house,

10:26.125 --> 10:27.918
Colton backed
into that Mustang

10:28.002 --> 10:29.128
and dented it.

{\an1}Yeah.
It's a good memory.

{\an7}Hi.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.506
{\an8}How are
you guys doing?

11:13.589 --> 11:15.549
{\an7}You know.

{\an8}You do not
look too good.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.887
{\an7}I mean, I'm still, like...
it hurts.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.307
{\an1}I, like,
still can't face him.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.475
It's too soon.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.227
He told me he loved me.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.647
{\an1}Look, I get that he's,
like, in a profession...

11:29.730 --> 11:32.316
{\an8}There is no excuse.
Like, there's no excuse.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.151
{\an8}No, I know.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.151
{\an8}Like, you were out of town.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.611
There was no way
for you to know.

11:35.694 --> 11:36.987
{\an1}And I'm going back and,
like, rethinking everything.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.781
{\an1}So, was he
just going around town,

11:38.864 --> 11:40.783
flirting with every girl,

11:40.866 --> 11:42.618
{\an1}like, and then going home
with them?

11:42.701 --> 11:45.538
{\an1}Like, now I don't know what
was real and what wasn't.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.123
That sucks.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.501
{\an5}What angers me is,
like, would he ever
have told you?

11:50.584 --> 11:52.545
{\an4}Exactly. And then
I had to hear it...

11:50.584 --> 11:52.545
Right.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.089
{\an1}And then I had to hear it
from Canvas? Like...

11:55.172 --> 11:56.340
At least someone told you.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.633
{\an1}'Cause she's
all over Brandon anyway.

11:57.716 --> 12:00.553
{\an4}For the past month, I've been
watching her, like...

11:57.716 --> 12:00.553
{\an3}Yeah.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.888
{\an5}fawn over my boyfriend.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.888
Yeah, but if you
think about it,

12:02.972 --> 12:03.639
she did you a favor.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.724
I'm not saying
what she did

12:05.808 --> 12:07.309
was, like,
in the right, but, eh,

12:07.393 --> 12:10.312
{\an5}it's better to know than not.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.312
At least you know the truth.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.982
You've just
got to move forward

12:13.065 --> 12:14.483
and try to figure out
what's best for you.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.987
{\an4}(sighs)

12:14.567 --> 12:17.987

13:26.805 --> 13:28.224
I think you did
do her a favor.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.559
{\an1}I just think you were
the last person in the world

13:30.643 --> 13:31.936
{\an1}that she wanted
to hear that from.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.187

through that.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.064

like any female

13:35.147 --> 13:36.315
should go through that.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.108
Like, I don't want her
to sit there

out of (bleep) town,

13:41.278 --> 13:42.321

just not cool.

with someone, I'm
gonna flirt with him.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.290
It's not always out
of ill intention.

30:37.752 --> 30:40.630
Yeah, I need
some oxygen.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.966
{\an1}Dude, that completely
defeats the purpose

30:43.049 --> 30:44.008
of working out.

30:44.092 --> 30:44.551
This is why
I don't work out.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.803
Dude, put that out.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.763
That's why you can't
even finish your run.

30:48.846 --> 30:50.932
{\an1}Listen, I'm not the only ones
with problems around here.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.726
{\an1}Hannah's running around town
talking (bleep) about you.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.603
{\an1}Okay, what's new
at this point?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.981
{\an1}I wouldn't expect anything
less out of that girl.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.857
{\an1}Well, yesterday
at the little island party,

30:59.941 --> 31:03.152
talk turned into
a... Alex bashing.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.112
{\an1}This way.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.613
Why, like...?

31:05.697 --> 31:08.491
Something about...

31:05.697 --> 31:08.491
{\an1}Dude...

31:08.575 --> 31:10.535
Can't teach an old dog
new tricks.

31:10.618 --> 31:11.995
{\an4}(laughing)
Oh...

31:10.618 --> 31:11.995

31:13.121 --> 31:16.624
{\an1}As in, she's sick of the way
you treat Juliette.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.960
{\an1}I've about had it
with that girl at this point,

31:19.043 --> 31:21.838
when she's the one that has
absolutely no room to talk.

31:21.921 --> 31:25.425
{\an1}And this isn't once,
this isn't twice.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.343
It's not-- it happened--
it happens all the time,

31:27.427 --> 31:28.136
{\an1}and, like,
I just can't let it go.

31:28.219 --> 31:29.220
{\an1}It's not her business,
number one.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.682
{\an1}Like, her and Andrew
have a terrible relationship.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.309
{\an5}And you don't go
butting in...

31:32.765 --> 31:34.309

31:34.392 --> 31:35.310
and I don't get involved.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.769
So that's what she said,

31:36.853 --> 31:38.021
{\an1}"You can't teach
a new dog old tricks."

31:38.104 --> 31:39.689
No, can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

whatever.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.013
{\an8}would you have told her?

32:12.096 --> 32:14.515
{\an1}But I wouldn't have gone home
with him that night.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.516
You wouldn't have.

{\an1}I've gotten to know everyone
a little bit more

32:34.369 --> 32:35.495

{\an1}and one of the reasons
I moved down here

{\an1}was to try really hard
to work on that.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.709
{\an1}And I was hoping that telling
her would make something better,

32:41.793 --> 32:44.045
{\an1}because what's the point of
being in a relationship

32:44.128 --> 32:45.213
with a (bleep) like...

32:45.296 --> 32:47.215

I don't agree with exactly
how it went down,

I kind of--

a fresh face showed up,

38:07.201 --> 38:08.869
trouble was around the corner.

At least this time,

38:42.987 --> 38:44.280
{\an8}It's been a long week.

38:44.363 --> 38:45.906
There are so many birds
out there today.

38:45.990 --> 38:46.991
More than usual?

38:47.074 --> 38:49.410
More than usual.

{\an8}Spawning season.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.246
{\an8}You're so smart.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.832
Did you have fun yesterday?

38:54.915 --> 38:56.917
I had fun, yeah.

38:57.001 --> 38:57.960
{\an1}Looks like you were
having fun

38:58.044 --> 38:59.503
on that tube.

38:59.587 --> 39:00.212
Oh, here we go.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.340
Well, I'm just playing it out.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.886
She just got her heart
broken by Brandon

39:06.969 --> 39:08.888
and I'm her
closest guy friend.

39:08.971 --> 39:11.432
It's, it's... my job
to be there for her.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.894
It sucks
because he was drunk...

39:14.977 --> 39:16.520
That's not really an excuse.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.355
I mean,
it's not an excuse, but...

39:18.439 --> 39:20.274
{\an1}I feel bad for him
'cause I know he regrets it.

39:20.357 --> 39:23.444
{\an5}So, it sucks.

39:20.357 --> 39:23.444
Just don't feel bad for him.

39:23.527 --> 39:24.445
I don't know.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.571
I've been there.

39:25.654 --> 39:26.906
{\an1}Yeah.

39:25.654 --> 39:26.906
{\an3}Obviously.

39:26.989 --> 39:27.948
It's not a fun place.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.743
But I don't think
she's gonna take him back.

39:30.826 --> 39:35.623
{\an1}I don't know how you can
come back from that, you know?

39:35.706 --> 39:37.458
{\an1}Even if they did try,
she would never trust him,

39:37.541 --> 39:40.127
{\an1}they would... she would
always bring it up,

39:40.211 --> 39:42.296
{\an1}he would always,
you know...

39:42.379 --> 39:44.298
I can tell you're
getting a little--

39:44.381 --> 39:48.177
{\an4}I'm not...

39:44.381 --> 39:48.177
--irritated, but...

39:48.260 --> 39:49.512
something I actually got
a little irritated about

39:49.595 --> 39:52.932
when I was with Paul
earlier, he said that

39:53.015 --> 39:54.391
when we were on the boat,

39:54.475 --> 39:56.852
Hannah felt the need
to run her mouth about us.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.479
{\an1}Really?

39:56.936 --> 39:58.479
She was saying

39:58.562 --> 40:00.773
that you can't teach
an old dog new tricks

40:00.856 --> 40:03.234
and, like, how, like,
I'm gonna cheat on you.

40:03.317 --> 40:07.154
{\an1}Like, I get that she's
your friend, but, I mean...

40:07.238 --> 40:07.988
{\an1}Are you gonna
prove her wrong?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.991
{\an3}I have.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.284
I mean, I'm not doing it
to prove her wrong.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.661
{\an4}No.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.661
Like, I don't really care.

40:13.744 --> 40:14.161
{\an4}I know.

40:13.744 --> 40:14.161
I'm actually pretty mad,
because...

40:14.245 --> 40:15.287
Coming from the girl

40:15.371 --> 40:18.165
that cheats on her
boyfriend, I mean...

40:18.249 --> 40:20.501
Why are you
rolling your eyes?

40:20.584 --> 40:22.503
{\an5}That's really mean.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.503
Well, it's true.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.588
I don't care.
I really don't.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.006
{\an1}Hannah's just
trying to be protective.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.508
She doesn't let things go.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.886
{\an1}I'm not gonna let her
sit there and bad-mouth me.

40:30.970 --> 40:31.637
{\an8}Why would you ever say that?

40:31.720 --> 40:33.222
{\an7}She's just skeptical
of the guy

40:33.305 --> 40:35.641
{\an8}that's cheated on me before.

40:35.724 --> 40:36.976
{\an8}That's her (bleep) job.

40:37.059 --> 40:37.977
