02:49.586 --> 02:52.755
Carter, what d'you reckon?
Nice bit of glass?

02:54.633 --> 02:56.551
Yeah, it's a nice ring.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.011
Just don't feel the same way about you,
Miller. Sorry, mate.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.222
Yeah, it's for Sue.
Cost me two months' wages.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.516
I'm gonna pop the question.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.478
- Oh, Miller.
- What's up? I thought you'd be happy.

03:07.563 --> 03:10.022
Problem is she's a six out of ten, man.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.858
- Right, Sim?
- Yeah, a six.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.693
Six and a half.
And I'm being generous there, mate.

03:13.777 --> 03:14.777
You what?

03:14.862 --> 03:18.239
If you're gonna tie the knot with someone,
make sure they're a nine or a three.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.325
A stunner or a complete shitter.

03:21.952 --> 03:26.330
If you fall in the middle you're fucked, mate.
It's never gonna last.

03:26.415 --> 03:30.459
- That's bollocks, man.
- I'm talking bollocks, yeah?

03:30.544 --> 03:34.297
All right, we'll ask the others.
Text Clarkey. Ask her.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.724
Back up, back up! Go!

03:55.152 --> 03:58.362
- Everyone on the floor now!
- Don't move!

03:59.448 --> 04:01.407
You, move over in there!

04:01.491 --> 04:04.535
- Get over to the wall!
- Get on the floor!

04:04.620 --> 04:06.370
Don't fucking look at me!
Keep your hands high!

04:06.455 --> 04:08.414
You, get over here!

04:11.168 --> 04:13.461
Look at the fucking floor!

04:15.672 --> 04:17.589
Sixty seconds.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.966
Look at that gold!

04:24.514 --> 04:29.268
Got a text from Carter. Wants us to
score Miller's girlfriend out of 10.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.561
Don't know. I ain't slept with her.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.772
It's based on looks.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.941
Four and a half in a balaclava.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.027
- What about you, Lewis?
- Don't know her.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.364
What about me, then?
What would you rate me?

04:41.448 --> 04:47.119
Well, if it was prick size I'd give you a
two, but since we're talking about faces,

04:47.204 --> 04:49.205
I'll give you a two.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.125
Thirty seconds!

04:53.210 --> 04:55.211
Stay down there!

04:58.090 --> 04:59.507
Average.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.342
- Average?
- Yep.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.969
Not low enough to be grateful to you

05:03.053 --> 05:06.472
and not high enough
to make you grateful to her.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.432
Fucking recipe for disaster.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.851
What about your girl then?
What does she score?

05:10.936 --> 05:13.020
We're not married.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.906
- Armed police!
- Police! Get on the floor!

05:28.328 --> 05:30.454
Can you get out of the car for me?

05:30.539 --> 05:32.415
Get out of the fucking car now!

05:32.499 --> 05:34.875
You all right, Miller?

05:37.379 --> 05:40.339
Armed police! Get on the fucking floor!

05:47.889 --> 05:49.515
Come here!

05:58.859 --> 06:01.277
- You okay?
- Yeah, go, go, go.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.031
- Get on your fucking front!
- Come here!

06:05.490 --> 06:08.701
Don't move! On your front, yeah?
Don't fucking move!

06:08.785 --> 06:10.578
Get over here now!

06:36.980 --> 06:38.397
Fuck!

07:02.047 --> 07:05.049
We're the Sweeney, shithead. You're nicked.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.434
Yeah, nice work, Regan.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.895
But did you really have to
destroy the whole place in the process?

07:17.979 --> 07:19.313
We got the villains, didn't we?

07:19.397 --> 07:21.941
Well, I got the headache of explaining
why you smashed their heads in

07:22.025 --> 07:24.527
and wrecked the whole depot.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.655
You know we'll have Internal Affairs
on our back again.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.032
We got the villains, didn't we?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.701
Shit always rolls downhill, Jack, to me.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.078
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about the mess,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.497
but there just happened to be
an armed robbery in progress.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.667
Listen, if we wanna stay operational,
we gotta play the game.

07:39.751 --> 07:43.879
It ain't a game when you've got a G3
sticking in the back of your nut.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.133
You get Internal Affairs off my fucking
case and I'll get you results.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.136
Remember who runs this
unit, Jack, all right?

07:50.220 --> 07:52.096
Yeah, well, you know how we go to work.
Deal with it.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.100
Yeah, who put it all together
in the first place?

07:55.392 --> 07:58.185
- Who keeps the wolves from your door?
- Yeah, all right.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.396
- Well done, kid.
- All right.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.733
What was the estimate?

08:04.818 --> 08:08.654
Half a mill plus. Krugerrands and ingots.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.781
Everyone's okay?

08:10.866 --> 08:14.577
Yeah, Miller took one,
but he'll live to fight another day.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.248
The world's running out
of men like you, Jack.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.931
Yeah, yeah, fuck you!

08:40.937 --> 08:45.149
Hey, a toast. A toast to the new boy.
Popped his cherry on the pavement!

08:45.233 --> 08:47.067
Raise a fucking glass.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.528
- Go on, the Sweeney!
- Go on, Paddy.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.948
Yeah, yeah, and maybe next time
Regan will give you a weapon to hold!

08:53.033 --> 08:54.575
Fuck that.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.745
I became a copper because I'm Irish.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.833
All right, well, I became a copper
because I'm black.

09:04.419 --> 09:08.839
- What about you, Wex?
- I become a copper 'cause I'm black!

09:08.924 --> 09:10.216
What about you, pretty boy?

09:10.300 --> 09:11.550
As pretty as my face is,

09:11.635 --> 09:14.428
I obviously don't give a fuck about it
that much, as you can see.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.639
As far as I'm concerned,
there ain't any other job in the world

09:16.723 --> 09:18.766
that gives me the kind
of buzz this one does.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.434
Good boy.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.980
So if this pretty little face of mine has to
take a couple more beatings from time to time,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.649
so fucking be it, right, Sim?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.234
Got you, boy.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.945
- To Carter's face!
- To Carter's face!

09:31.029 --> 09:33.239
It's an improvement on when you left
the house this morning, darling.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.366
Yeah? Yeah?

09:35.450 --> 09:39.286
I'm only kidding.
You're better looking than this lot!

10:12.362 --> 10:15.823
- When you gonna leave him?
- When you gonna ask me?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.494
I don't like the fact you
go home and fuck him.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.039
I haven't fucked him in over a year,
you know that.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.624
Please.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.713
He hasn't made me laugh in over two.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.232
- Duty calls.
- Yeah.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.360
It always does.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.549
All right, Harry?

11:16.718 --> 11:19.928
- How's your luck?
- Okay. Yourself?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.473
Well, still in with a shot.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.979
- How's your leg?
- Still giving me agg.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.320
I hear the work went off well?

11:36.404 --> 11:39.948
Yeah, it was just like you said,
almost fell in our laps.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.117
Word is, one of them got a good hiding.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.453
George did it.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.959
Have you got anything else for me?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.545
Heard about a private bank
on Trafalgar Square?

11:53.630 --> 11:56.298
Apparently it's being looked at.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.052
Nah. No one's that fucking silly any more.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.179
They say it's a sitting duck.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.431
I'll swing past it tomorrow with George.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.433
How is he?

12:06.518 --> 12:09.311
Who, George? George is George, isn't he?

12:10.146 --> 12:12.147
What about you, Jack?
Seeing anyone special?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.775
Schtum. What's the matter with you?

12:15.485 --> 12:18.153
You're getting a nosy old bastard.

12:20.490 --> 12:24.743
I'd better get back in there.
Make sure Carter's behaving himself.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.167
Sweeney!

12:34.421 --> 12:40.759
Sweeney! Sweeney!

12:58.361 --> 13:01.321
- Uncle Jack, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.615
Looking for a cigarette.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.785
Give us one.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.415
Ta.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.169
- Anyway, you shouldn't be smoking.
- Why?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.796
Because you're training
for your sports day.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.682
Looks like you should
be in training as well.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.967
Saucy little sod. Go on.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.805
And don't listen to George,
he's a bad influence.

13:26.890 --> 13:30.142
Are you listening, Neil?
Your stepdad's a bad seed.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.603
You can talk, can't you, mate?

13:35.690 --> 13:37.316
Very romantic, toilets.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.401
God, is that the time?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.737
- We gotta go.
- When was you gonna tell me?

13:41.821 --> 13:45.824
We've gotta flop on that jug
that Harry was talking about.

13:45.909 --> 13:49.828
- How long you been banging her for, Jack?
- And Haskins has called for a briefing.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.498
You do know she's married, don't you?

13:55.835 --> 13:59.588
I've known you half my life
and you didn't think to tell me?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.634
What you don't know won't kill you.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.767
- Do you know her husband?
- Yeah, we knock about together, don't we?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.436
- I mean, do you know who he is?
- Armchair Old Bill.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.812
And he knows about you and her?

14:15.897 --> 14:18.482
What? Me banging her?
Yeah. Thinks it's a great idea.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.858
Nice bloke, then?

14:19.943 --> 14:22.528
- Couldn't roll downhill.
- He what?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.530
He's a fucking square!

14:24.614 --> 14:28.617
Right. You've got 30 seconds
to tell me how you'd rob this bank.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.207
I wouldn't worry about the CCTV
'cause they don't feed out externally.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.626
Getting your hands on a tape
shouldn't be a problem.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.879
It's a private bank, innit?
Private security.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.964
And this lot ain't got a license
to carry firearms,

14:43.007 --> 14:45.425
so, what? Pistols and cable ties
would keep them quiet.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.678
Driver out the front,
two to three through the door,

14:47.762 --> 14:50.055
neutralise the desk
clerk, dominate the room

14:50.139 --> 14:51.682
and disorientate the security.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.225
You'll need one geezer to hold the floor,

14:53.309 --> 14:55.394
while the other two take the lift
up to the strong room.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.022
But only after collecting all mobiles
and depositing them over there.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.400
Got London Underground
situated conveniently close by.

15:01.484 --> 15:06.822
Again, if it all goes tits up out the front,
I'd definitely use that as a possible route.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.451
As for the loot,
I'd settle on any high-denomination bills.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.498
Nice to see you learnt something
in your childhood, George.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.085
Yeah, well, you gotta act like a criminal
to catch one, don't you?

15:21.296 --> 15:24.256
Officers, Mr Bledisloe is here to see you.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.801
- I'd much rather talk to you.
- Unlikely.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.386
What about me?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.935
Regan. Flying Squad.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.772
Just a routine check.
What do you actually do here?

15:40.857 --> 15:42.441
I'm the manager.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.985
No, I mean, what does the bank do?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.654
We're a private clearing bank.

15:47.739 --> 15:52.701
We hold large amounts of foreign currency
for mostly Middle Eastern clients.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.079
We work with Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Dubai...

15:56.164 --> 15:57.456
How large?

15:57.540 --> 16:00.792
On the right day and the right week,
up to 10 million in cash.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.628
And you ain't got proper security?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.296
- Yes, we do.
- No, you ain't.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.049
They'd shit theirself
with a 9-mil in the back of the canister.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.300
We're not a High Street bank.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.803
If you was, there'd be a
blag here every week.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.139
And who's intending to "blag" us?

16:14.223 --> 16:17.100
As I said, this is just a routine check.

16:17.185 --> 16:21.313
We tend not to invite police in the bank
too often, it can unnerve the staff.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.065
No one invited us.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.903
Very well, if there's nothing else...

16:30.365 --> 16:31.907
What a cunt!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.575
- I like him.
- You would.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.661
He's got panache.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.865
You want me to stick someone on here
and watch it?

16:37.914 --> 16:40.916
Yeah, Wextru.
He likes sitting on his arse doing nothing.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.434
Hello. Hello, hello.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.937
- Jack.
- Jack.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.692
How's it going, Lewis?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.778
How's life at the sharp end?

17:10.613 --> 17:15.157
Must be run off your feet catching all them
criminals from behind the desk.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.913
I don't need to be on the streets
to make arrests, Jack.

17:19.997 --> 17:23.250
There's an abundance of criminals
amongst the police keeping me busy,

17:23.334 --> 17:24.835
you know that.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.963
Tiring work, is it?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.482
Excuse me, yeah?

17:48.985 --> 17:50.402
Bye for now.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.406
Wanker.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.743
Grow up, Jack. He's not stupid.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.204
Don't give him a reason
to look up your skirt.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.458
As long as he ain't looking up your skirt.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.265
Come on.

18:29.484 --> 18:30.734
You go left and I'll go right.

18:30.818 --> 18:34.988
We wouldn't want anyone to think
we're banging each other, would we?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.869
- Aye, aye.
- All right, guv?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.288
- What you got?
- Sign.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.956
Lovely.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.626
Me and Regan went down to QTZ today.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.294
What's QTZ?

18:49.378 --> 18:52.798
- It's a private bank in Trafalgar Square.
- Never heard of it.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.134
The reason you've never heard about it
before is 'cause it's private.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.385
Funny.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.598
Anyway, Regan wants you to go down there
and put the place under observation.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.475
- Why me?
- Why not you?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.902
Morning, Sweeney.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.698
Good job yesterday. Top drawer.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.576
Got a friend with me here today.

19:21.661 --> 19:26.498
I know it's hard enough what we do
without being observed as we do it,

19:26.582 --> 19:28.083
nevertheless,

19:28.167 --> 19:32.254
I'd like you to give a warm welcome
to Detective Ivan Lewis from Internals,

19:32.338 --> 19:35.173
who I know some of you already know.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.426
So no larking about.
Give him what he needs, okay?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.428
Thanks, Haskins.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.641
- Jack, nice to see you again.
- How you going?

19:44.725 --> 19:48.770
I'll make this brief.
I'm not here looking for scalps.

19:49.772 --> 19:53.900
All right? I'm not here to shut you down.
I'm just here to observe.

19:54.652 --> 19:59.197
Observe how you operate and, if need be,
suggest some adjustments to your approach

19:59.282 --> 20:02.492
and maybe make some recommendations
of how to improve,

20:02.577 --> 20:04.703
enhance the unit's success rate.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.329
Success rate?

20:06.414 --> 20:10.542
We've just taken out an armed robbery
with no civilian casualties.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.712
The week before that, a
security van attempt.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.338
And all suspects are in custody.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.049
Now, have you got a problem with that?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.343
- No, Jack.
- Good.

20:21.721 --> 20:26.182
And by the way,
people who don't know me call me Regan.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.273
The problem...

20:34.066 --> 20:38.361
The problem is
the significant number of legal cases

20:38.446 --> 20:40.906
that's mounting against your unit.

20:40.990 --> 20:45.911
And these exclusive
and, frankly, exorbitant Sweeney offices

20:45.995 --> 20:48.997
- funded by the tax payer with...
- It's the tax payer we look after.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.541
It causes resentment
in other departments, you know?

20:51.626 --> 20:54.419
- Oh, fuck!
- The problem is the...

20:55.338 --> 20:59.090
Methods and tactics you employ.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.052
I mean, there's even talk of baseball bats.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.306
Pick ax handles being used
to attack suspects.

21:06.390 --> 21:11.019
The problem is the collateral damage
that's left in your wake...

21:11.103 --> 21:14.439
The problem is people like you
that don't let us do our fucking job.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.859
- Easy, Jack.
- Oh, I'm being fucking easy here.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.988
Carter, your lot supposed to be somewhere?

21:22.073 --> 21:24.157
Combat training, sir.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.868
Give me five, will ya?

21:29.413 --> 21:31.414
Don't go too far, George.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.547
So what is it then, Lewis?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.132
What do you want to see?
Your name up in lights,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.426
with a medal pinned on you
for bringing down the Flying Squad?

21:43.511 --> 21:45.136
Regan. Leave it.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.888
Yeah, all right.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.640
What are you like?

21:48.724 --> 21:51.685
You wanna be the little man
that brought down the Sweeney?

21:51.769 --> 21:55.897
Is that it? It's people like you
who want to make us obsolete.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.985
'Cause we still do the things
that you can only fucking dream of.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.323
Now, do you wanna take us on?

22:06.117 --> 22:09.786
Well, you can have a go.
I mean, other people have had a go.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.788
Have you got big bollocks?

22:11.872 --> 22:15.709
Have you? You got big fucking nuts?
Let's have a look at them.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.714
No, I don't think you have.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.430
Tell me something, Lewis.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.684
Is your problem with the job or with me?

22:41.736 --> 22:43.028
The job.

22:43.738 --> 22:48.116
It transpires that some of these ingots
went missing from a crime scene.

22:48.617 --> 22:53.913
It's also emerged that
everybody but the Sweeney was searched.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.166
So what?

22:56.250 --> 23:00.045
Tip of an already melting iceberg.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.467
I work on the front line, son.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.511
Criminals I hunt want me dead.

23:08.596 --> 23:13.433
Day in and day out, I'm undermanned,
under-armed and underpaid.

23:15.519 --> 23:20.106
I fight crime on the street, not from
behind a fucking desk where I can hide.

23:20.191 --> 23:25.528
So do something useful, Lewis,
like catch real fucking criminals.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.664
Regan?

23:40.377 --> 23:42.504
Everyone's got a weak point.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.290
- Everyone on the floor!
- Put me down!

24:57.538 --> 25:00.999
Run, Neil. Run, you little bastard!

25:01.083 --> 25:02.167
Sorry.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.113
Yes! Fucking number one!

25:32.781 --> 25:34.866
Go on, Neil!

25:36.493 --> 25:37.619
Knock yourself out.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.143
You nasty bastard.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.994
- Any luck, John?
- Nothing.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.163
Well, I need something.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.292
- A little unnecessary, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.380
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking Italian tonight.

26:31.924 --> 26:35.677
- What about this mess? Where do you start?
- I'd ignore that.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.596
The getaway car already found
out by Heathrow.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.140
- Yeah.
- It was torched using phosphorus.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.268
It was stolen out of Manchester
about a week ago

26:43.352 --> 26:45.728
and it was reported, and
the plates changed.

26:45.813 --> 26:49.816
Jack, victim was foreign. Natalija Wolscat.

26:51.277 --> 26:55.947
She was working as a temp in a legal firm.
She was only in here buying jewelery.

26:56.031 --> 26:59.534
Ran a check on her.
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.120
She's a civilian.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.873
- Right, that's it.
- All right, guv?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.166
Ta.

27:07.251 --> 27:11.462
The murder weapon was a 9 mm, possibly
a Smithy or a high-powered Browning.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.716
Gonna run a check on the spent cases
now, I'll get back to you ASAP.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.260
But judging by the circumference
of the exit wound,

27:17.344 --> 27:19.595
I'd say they were using dumdums.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.723
- They don't mess about, do they?
- Don't fucking mess about.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.935
Guv, I found a shaped
charge, what's left of it.

27:26.020 --> 27:30.648
Fucking hell, Ellis. You should be
wearing a glove if you're touching that.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.943
What a stain to have on your soul?

27:34.028 --> 27:38.197
Take someone's life for a couple of
hundred grand's worth of stones.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.826
I mean, you'd just leave the fucking work
and walk, wouldn't you?

27:41.910 --> 27:42.994
Yeah.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.376
Looks like they panicked
when the hold-up alarm went.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.378
Why else would they top her?

27:52.463 --> 27:53.963
Got any ideas?

27:56.091 --> 27:58.134
That was blown in 2000.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.303
That was blown the same year.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.847
That was blown the following year.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.141
And that was blown today.

28:08.145 --> 28:11.064
What do you notice
about the shaped charges?

28:16.779 --> 28:19.864
- They're all the same.
- Well done, Grasshopper.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.866
Now, see him?

28:21.950 --> 28:25.286
I gave him his first two sentences
when he was just a teenager.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.789
He robbed a post office
while he was still at school.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.957
He's a fucking torpedo.

28:33.087 --> 28:37.423
Francis Allen. Six years for armed robbery
and attempted murder.

28:37.508 --> 28:41.260
Back behind bars
one week after release for another robbery.

28:41.345 --> 28:44.972
Gets parole. After that
the trail goes cold.

28:45.057 --> 28:49.185
He progressed to running
guns for the Provos.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.895
Earned an absolute fucking fortune

28:50.979 --> 28:55.024
supplying breakaway paramilitary groups,
you know,

28:55.109 --> 28:57.735
with small firearms, light weaponry.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.781
He's got links in Eastern Europe,
Chechnya, Russia, Serbia.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.158
By all accounts,
he went to ground in Montenegro.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.661
- So why come back now?
- Don't know.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.124
Rob a shitty little low-end jewelers?

29:12.543 --> 29:15.878
He's either done all his
beans and gone skint,

29:15.963 --> 29:20.174
or an opportunity came his way
and he simply just couldn't say no.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.552
Well, let's find him and ask him.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.929
Shake a few trees, see what falls out.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.849
And get Simmonds
to go down Hatton Garden,

29:27.933 --> 29:29.934
see if anyone's tried to
fence that bit of tom.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.727
I'm on it.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.939
I'll pick up the new motor,
flop on a few grasses.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.233
Someone's got to know if he's come back.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.526
You look excited.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.113
Yeah, Francis Allen, guv.
Looks like he's come out of retirement.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.281
I need a word.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.367
- I'm jogging on.
- Regan! I said I need a word.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.536
Now.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.539
Yes, guv.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.544
What's up?

29:58.589 --> 30:01.299
You're playing with a straight bat,
aren't you, Jack?

30:01.383 --> 30:02.467
What?

30:03.051 --> 30:06.387
Reassure me that Lewis and his boys
have got nothing on you.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.848
Nothing that can come back and haunt us.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.349
Nothing, no.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.064
His team are taking it more seriously
than I anticipated.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.699
- No.
- Good.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.863
All right, nail your boy for the robbery.
I'm sure this'll be forgotten about.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.287
- Can I splice now?
- Yeah.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.580
Lovely.

30:40.756 --> 30:44.050
- What do you know about Allen?
- He's a slag.

30:44.134 --> 30:47.553
- You close?
- Nah, I gave him his first bit of porridge.

30:47.638 --> 30:50.932
Thought it would be a matter of time
before I saw his fucking face again.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.685
See, cats like Allen, they
can't help theirself.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.437
You look excited.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.273
Sorry, it's your tits.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.610
They don't stick out as much as your belly.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.906
What you saying? I gotta
lose a bit of weight?

31:06.990 --> 31:09.951
As long as you don't
lose your charm as well.

31:13.038 --> 31:18.125
I suppose I could lose
a couple of kilos for you.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.545
Oh, I'm touched.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.005
- I wish I fucking was.
- You're about to be.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.715
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Here we go.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.884
Eyes on the road.

31:34.935 --> 31:38.354
- How do you wanna play this?
- Very low key. No trouble.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.648
- Members only.
- Move.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.525
I said, members...

31:42.609 --> 31:44.443
We're the Sweeney, son.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.488
Get out of the fucking way
or else I'll break your legs.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.408
Listen up!

31:50.993 --> 31:53.494
Now, calm down, we're not here for drugs.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.123
- What do you want, Regan?
- Not you, you fucking grass.

31:58.292 --> 32:01.502
Fucking hell, Regan. Who dug you up, then?

32:02.254 --> 32:05.590
- What do you want?
- Francis Allen. Where is he?

32:06.300 --> 32:09.343
Leave it out. He ain't
been about for years.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.970
You know that.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.015
Well, maybe he just came back.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.601
What do you know about a jewelery robbery?

32:16.685 --> 32:19.020
Innocent girl got one
in the back of the nut.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.646
Ring any bells?

32:22.524 --> 32:24.817
Would you like me to jog
your fucking memory?

32:24.901 --> 32:28.154
Leave it out, Regan.
You got nish, and you know it.

32:28.238 --> 32:31.866
Why don't you take
this fucking little drat and piss off?

32:32.367 --> 32:34.035
Well, I'm gonna enjoy this
a lot more than you are.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.121
Yeah, you think you're gonna enjoy what?
What...

32:37.205 --> 32:38.706
Fucking witch!

32:42.210 --> 32:45.046
Nobody takes liberties on my patch.

32:45.130 --> 32:50.176
If I find out you or any one of these slags
know about Allen and his bit of work,

32:50.260 --> 32:54.513
I'll hit you so fucking hard,
you'll wish you were already in prison.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.732
What a fucking world this is.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.235
What you looking at?

33:13.533 --> 33:16.327
I don't understand. Why would someone
tell you where our man is,

33:16.411 --> 33:17.662
and no one wants to talk to me?

33:17.746 --> 33:19.497
What? Am I losing my touch here?

33:19.581 --> 33:22.782
What can I say? I just come about it from
a different angle than you, that's all.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.835
- You know, ask them nicely.
- Oh, fuck!

33:24.920 --> 33:26.754
Anyway, my new mate here...

33:26.838 --> 33:27.880
- You all right, mate?
- Just bring me up.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.965
Just on the phone, one sec.

33:30.050 --> 33:33.511
He reckons our boy Allen's got
a little bolt-hole in the countryside.

33:33.595 --> 33:36.681
Little anonymous gaff
in the middle of nowhere.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.891
I reckon we should get down there, soon as.

33:40.352 --> 33:44.772
Report to me anything you see.
Do not come off of Channel 6.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.150
Do not compromise our play.

33:48.985 --> 33:53.614
This is Francis Allen we're dealing with.
He's a very capable and dangerous man.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.951
He has killed and he will kill again.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.791
Where the fuck are you?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.925
Been here fucking hours.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.764
Do you think he's even in there?

34:19.850 --> 34:22.976
Well, we'll know one way or the other,
won't we?

34:23.687 --> 34:27.063
He's really got under your skin,
hasn't he, this one?

34:29.985 --> 34:32.737
I can't have animals running about,
killing innocent girls

34:32.821 --> 34:35.614
and thinking they can get away with it,
George.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.574
Not while I'm Sweeney.

34:39.369 --> 34:42.036
Fuck me.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.916
Guv, can I ask your advice on something?

34:46.001 --> 34:48.710
Yeah, go on, knock yourself out, Ellis.

34:50.672 --> 34:54.257
What would be the best way
of asking Lewis out on a date?

34:58.847 --> 35:00.639
- Lewis?
- Yeah, Nancy.

35:01.933 --> 35:06.103
Got a fierce crush on her.
Been thinking about asking her to dinner.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.607
I wouldn't bother if I was you, Ellis.

35:09.691 --> 35:13.903
Well, I fancy her loads and it looks like her
marriage is going down the shitter, so...

35:13.987 --> 35:18.365
Listen, that's a work colleague of ours
you're talking about here, yeah.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.619
Stop being so unprofessional.

35:22.162 --> 35:25.414
Oh, who cares? I'm nuts about her.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.041
Ellis, shut it.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.590
I just really wanna fuck her.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.133
Oh, fucking hell.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.344
And how would you feel
if you ever got the chance, Ellis?

35:38.428 --> 35:41.468
Oh, Jesus. I'd be up on the back of her
like a Jack Russell with two mickeys.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.808
Oh, nito. Nito!

35:43.892 --> 35:45.392
It's Simmonds.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.395
Saveloy!

35:48.897 --> 35:50.397
Where's Wextru?

35:50.482 --> 35:52.191
You sent him to stick a bank
under observation.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.943
Fuck the bank, I want him here.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.153
What about if Allen comes?
I want the whole team here.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.824
- George, get on the blower.
- Here, americano, two sugars.

36:00.116 --> 36:03.494
And an organic soya latte for you, guv.

36:04.913 --> 36:09.041
Soya? Since when did you start
drinking fucking soya?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.001
Oh, fuck me.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.846
She got you on the healthy milk now,
has she?

36:12.921 --> 36:14.713
- Who's that?
- No one.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.717
Is it that serious? Is
it fucking soya serious?

36:19.302 --> 36:22.888
Well, judge for yourself.
She's coming to dinner.

36:24.808 --> 36:28.018
I will have the prawn
cocktail for starters.

36:28.436 --> 36:33.858
Then beef lasagne, some chips and some
garlic bread, please. Eating for two.

36:34.568 --> 36:38.654
I'll have the deep-fried brie to start

36:38.738 --> 36:42.116
and then the roast loin of pork

36:42.200 --> 36:46.036
and a side of chips. Can I get
some mayonnaise with that as well?

36:46.121 --> 36:48.539
I will have... What's a whitebait?

36:48.623 --> 36:51.876
Them little tiny little fishes with
little miserable looks on their faces...

36:51.960 --> 36:54.086
- Yes, darling.
- ...we had in Greece?

36:54.170 --> 36:57.631
I like them. We had them in Greece.
I'll have some of them.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.759
I'll also have rigatoni and meatballs.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.345
Can I have escalope?
Veal escalope on the side.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.097
God, I'm starving.

37:06.683 --> 37:10.769
A bit of garlic bread, I think. Yeah.
What are you having?

37:20.906 --> 37:23.490
I'll have the pear and walnut salad.

37:24.492 --> 37:25.868
All right.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.995
Cheers, mate.

37:34.836 --> 37:38.339
- Did you tell Jack yet, darling?
- No.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.800
George has applied for a promotion to DS.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.137
They're hearing it, too.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.014
Marvelous.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.020
How's Neil doing at school, Meg?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.315
Piss off, Jack.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.277
You never asked about him before.
Anyone would think you cared, mate.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.904
Just enquiring.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.782
So George tells me you're married, Nancy?

38:05.241 --> 38:07.618
Yes. But Jack's a better fuck.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.960
That's a good one.

38:16.044 --> 38:20.339
I'm only joking. Just that, you know,
I'm in the final stages of a marriage.

38:20.423 --> 38:24.593
The only thing keeping us together
is the roof over our heads. So...

38:46.866 --> 38:50.202
Fuckin' hell. No danger of you and me
getting it on tonight, is there?

38:50.286 --> 38:52.287
I'm trying here. I'm fucking trying.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.173
You might lose it before
you get me into bed.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.167
I've got more chance of losing a stone.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.642
If you was looking at
what I was looking at,

39:13.893 --> 39:16.270
you'd know why I was so excited.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.579
Sure it was Allen?

39:33.663 --> 39:37.041
Yeah. He pulled up in a Range Rover
and went in with a suitcase.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.293
Could be the jewels.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.972
Positive ID.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.641
Guess who just woke up.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.065
- We've gotta fucking go now, Carter.
- Wait.

40:01.149 --> 40:05.527
Listen, Jack, we're gonna miss the boat
on this one if we don't go now.

40:05.612 --> 40:06.820
Hold up.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.031
Who's this?

40:10.742 --> 40:15.162
Nobody move.
Unidentified behicle approaching.

40:15.997 --> 40:19.416
Roger that.
We're in position and we're ready to move.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.545
That's gotta be them, innit?

40:24.005 --> 40:26.006
It's the rest of the firm.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.926
Move into position.

40:29.010 --> 40:33.347
Remember, this lot don't mess about,
so hit 'em hard and fast.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.849
Dominate and pacify.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.269
I've got a fuckin' hard
on, I'm telling you.

40:42.857 --> 40:46.360
Simmonds, with me. Ellis, along the wall.
Come on.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.331
Armed police!

40:59.415 --> 41:01.166
Go, go, go, go!

41:08.007 --> 41:09.508
Get up, you...

41:12.846 --> 41:14.763
Ellis, one coming your way!

41:15.598 --> 41:18.225
- Don't fucking move!
- Go, fuck off!

41:54.053 --> 41:58.974
Carter, in pursuit of Allen!
Get in the gardening van and cut him off!

42:01.102 --> 42:03.103
Can you hear me? George?

42:04.189 --> 42:05.439
Fuck it!

42:21.164 --> 42:22.706
Oh, fuck!

42:43.269 --> 42:45.604
Where was you?

42:56.491 --> 42:58.200
Put your trousers on. You're nicked.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.745
I'm gonna rub you right up.
You're gonna get plenty of porridge, son.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.747
Keep fucking moving.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.335
Keep your fucking head round that way.

43:32.235 --> 43:36.571
- Do you want a cigarette?
- I don't want fucking nothing from you, mate.

43:40.285 --> 43:45.122
Look, Freddy, I'm sure your whole life
you've been told not to talk to the police.

43:45.206 --> 43:49.501
You live by a code.
Honor amongst thieves and all that.

43:49.585 --> 43:52.045
Believe it or not, I respect that.

43:52.839 --> 43:55.882
But, you see,
your code's already been broken.

43:56.384 --> 44:00.137
'Cause armed robbery is one thing
and murder is another.

44:01.055 --> 44:05.434
You know, I ain't got a clue
what you're talking about.

44:05.518 --> 44:06.893
I was at a barbecue.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.061
Bang!

44:12.400 --> 44:16.653
I wonder how it would really feel
to be shot in the head. Point blank.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.991
One minute
you're going about your business,

44:21.909 --> 44:25.454
buying a present for a friend, the next...

44:25.538 --> 44:27.164
- Bang!
- ...nothing.

44:28.041 --> 44:31.752
Gone. A full stop on an ordinary life.

44:34.297 --> 44:37.466
A bit funny, innit,
you all meeting round Allen's this morning?

44:37.550 --> 44:40.177
I told you. I was at a barbecue, gawer.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.888
- Bollocks.
- Why don't you check the shopping bags?

44:42.972 --> 44:45.557
You think I carry fucking pork chops around
with me for the fun of it?

44:45.641 --> 44:47.768
Listen to me,
I went round there for a barbecue.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.573
Bollocks. You went round to Allen's house
for your lick of the lolly.

44:50.646 --> 44:54.691
I've got a bag full of peppered steaks
and sausages out there. Go and have a look.

44:54.776 --> 44:56.818
What the fuck happened to you, Allen?

44:56.903 --> 44:59.988
I used to think you was a bit of a player
a few years ago.

45:00.073 --> 45:04.201
Now you're turning over
two-bob jewelery shops.

45:05.912 --> 45:07.662
And killing punters.

45:08.164 --> 45:10.874
- You the trigger man, then?
- No comment.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.293
You like killing innocent women?

45:14.962 --> 45:17.547
She was only buying a present
for a fucking friend, you scum!

45:17.632 --> 45:18.799
Twenty-three years old.

45:20.510 --> 45:25.222
Shaped charge like that is only available
from an industrial builders' merchants.

45:25.306 --> 45:28.016
And you need a ticket for that.

45:29.977 --> 45:33.480
It's a specialist skill set.

45:37.318 --> 45:42.489
Only someone with a criminal
or military history would be capable.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.741
And you weren't in the army, was ya,

45:44.826 --> 45:48.036
'cause I stuck you in the fucking shovel?

45:50.832 --> 45:52.916
- Come here.
- What's up, man?

45:54.001 --> 45:55.419
You see, Mr Guilty Murderer,

45:55.503 --> 45:58.463
I'm the kind of person, I want to see
those responsible brought to justice,

45:58.548 --> 46:01.133
but, you, you're the kind of person,

46:01.217 --> 46:05.804
if you had any information on someone
like that, you'd keep it to yourself.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.901
The wrist. May I?

46:23.865 --> 46:25.615
Knock yourself out.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.044
Do you know what that is?

46:39.005 --> 46:41.423
It's a watch mark tan line.

46:42.550 --> 46:43.800
Know why?

46:48.723 --> 46:50.849
'Cause I've been in the sun.

46:52.268 --> 46:53.351
So?

46:53.436 --> 46:56.396
So you can sit there
and say anything you want about me

46:56.481 --> 46:58.315
and that bit of work,

46:59.317 --> 47:01.401
you can tell me it's my MO,

47:02.904 --> 47:05.447
how it could have only come from me,

47:07.867 --> 47:13.663
fingerprints, DNA, shaped charge.

47:13.748 --> 47:14.831
Yeah.

47:15.917 --> 47:18.919
There is one fact you're
overlooking, Regan.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.253
What's that?

47:20.338 --> 47:22.881
One piece of undeniable evidence

47:22.965 --> 47:26.176
that any jury in the land
will chuck out of court.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.261
Go on.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.765
I was on my yacht,

47:33.976 --> 47:35.602
lying in the sun.

47:38.606 --> 47:41.149
You're gonna have to do
better than that, son.

47:41.234 --> 47:44.903
Why don't you ask your sidekick
to bring my mobile phone in here?

47:44.987 --> 47:46.321
Please.

47:51.077 --> 47:54.162
George? Bring this slag's
mobile in, will you?

47:56.457 --> 47:58.083
I know it's you.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.669
When I put you away, it
will be for so long,

48:00.753 --> 48:04.965
next time you come out,
you'll be walking on fucking sticks.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.134
Maybe.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.812
Go on, dig an 'ole for yourself.

48:46.465 --> 48:52.178
It's me, on board my yacht.
Moored off the coast of Montenegro.

49:01.731 --> 49:04.733
The time and date's at
the top of the screen.

49:07.278 --> 49:10.196
- But you saw that, didn't you, Regan?
- Yeah.

49:15.995 --> 49:18.121
Regan, quick word.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.416
I'll be right there, guv.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.259
Keep your nut on him.

49:31.969 --> 49:36.139
You seem like a smart man, Francis.
You shouldn't underestimate me.

49:37.141 --> 49:39.225
I ain't no one's sidekick.

49:42.897 --> 49:44.356
What you got?

49:45.900 --> 49:47.692
The electronic strip on his passport

49:47.777 --> 49:51.488
confirms he was out of the country
at the time of the robbery.

49:51.572 --> 49:55.075
He re-entered the night Wextru saw him
with a suitcase.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.913
I think you've got the wrong man.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.458
Anyone could have carried his passport.

50:03.542 --> 50:06.461
You know what he's capable of.
It's a move, guv.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.380
It doesn't look like a move from here.

50:08.464 --> 50:11.925
And you know we only have him in custody
for 24 hours.

50:12.385 --> 50:15.146
I just need one more little piece
of evidence to tie him to the crime.

50:15.179 --> 50:17.055
Get it quickly, Regan.

50:17.390 --> 50:20.058
You don't charge him by 10:00 a.m.
tomorrow, he's a free man,

50:20.142 --> 50:22.769
and you're sitting in a pile of shit.

50:44.291 --> 50:47.085
I'm sick of sneaking about in the shadows.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.839
I want you to leave him.
I want you to live with me.

50:50.923 --> 50:53.508
What? Here in a Holiday Inn?
It's not that easy.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.427
I'll get a gaff.

50:58.305 --> 51:02.559
We can set up shop together, you and me.
I mean, we're good together.

51:05.146 --> 51:07.230
You make me feel...

51:10.317 --> 51:11.526
Hungry.

51:18.159 --> 51:19.909
Just think about it.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.582
Come, get back into bed, Jack.
You're stressed.

51:25.666 --> 51:29.043
Nah. I've got this slag in a cell.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.130
I know he's fucking playing me.

51:32.214 --> 51:35.717
I just can't link him to the crime,
but I know he done it.

51:35.801 --> 51:36.926
I know, Jack.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.429
- I just want to put him away.
- I know, Jack.

51:39.513 --> 51:42.557
- I need to fucking put him away.
- I know, Jack.

52:03.996 --> 52:05.288
Who is it?

52:05.372 --> 52:08.041
It's the Pope. Who do you think it is?

52:12.713 --> 52:14.714
What's wrong with you? Don't you sleep?

52:14.799 --> 52:16.966
Put your clothes on, George.

52:22.014 --> 52:24.599
Three armed males enter the premises.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.143
There's one driver outside.
One holds the door.

52:27.228 --> 52:30.104
Two clear the premises
and work the counters.

52:30.189 --> 52:33.358
Shaped charge blows the safe.

52:33.442 --> 52:36.194
They're in and out in under two minutes.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.239
There's one victim.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.735
An innocent girl
who was just buying a fucking present.

52:42.785 --> 52:45.078
I mean, what's that all about?

52:46.789 --> 52:50.166
Two hundred grand's worth of stones
and tom gone.

52:50.251 --> 52:52.752
- What have we got?
- We've got Allen.

52:52.837 --> 52:55.255
Yeah. Only for a couple of hours.

52:58.467 --> 52:59.968
Play it again.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.389
- That's it.
- Wait. I've gone back too far.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.558
Fuck it. Leave it, let it play.

53:06.642 --> 53:10.436
Two come in, clear the place.
Shaped charge the fucking...

53:13.941 --> 53:15.233
Where's my fucking glasses?

53:15.317 --> 53:17.694
Has anyone checked her phone records
to find out who she's talking to?

53:17.778 --> 53:19.737
Yeah, Simmonds is on it.

53:23.576 --> 53:26.035
It's funny how,
a few seconds after she hangs up,

53:26.120 --> 53:28.246
the place gets knocked over.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.294
Watch.

53:39.008 --> 53:41.843
Why turn back? They got what they came for.

53:41.927 --> 53:44.053
He didn't need to kill her.

53:46.932 --> 53:49.309
He's done it for another reason.

53:50.811 --> 53:53.354
He's killed her for another reason.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.108
It wasn't just a robbery.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.153
It was an execution.

54:07.286 --> 54:08.411
- Guv?
- Yeah.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.289
Allen killed the girl to cover something up.
Weren't just a robbery.

54:11.373 --> 54:14.751
Look at the CCTV.
He murdered her for another reason.

54:14.835 --> 54:18.129
We've run a check on her mobile phone.
She's got one number in her address book.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.494
- It's a pay as you go.
- Let me guess, it's disconnected?

54:20.549 --> 54:23.009
Yeah. It's already dead.

54:23.093 --> 54:26.888
- Where are you?
- We're on our way to the victim's house now.

54:26.972 --> 54:30.224
You've got two hours, Regan.
After that, he's gone.

54:30.768 --> 54:33.937
And Lewis has got all he needs
to put the bite on you.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.362
I'm Officer Carter from the Flying Squad.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.614
We're investigating the murder
of Natalija Wolscat.

54:44.698 --> 54:47.033
We believe she was renting a room here.
Is that correct?

54:47.117 --> 54:49.911
- I've already spoken to the police.
- Not to us, you haven't.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.288
- It's still early in the morning.
- So what?

54:52.373 --> 54:56.542
- Have you seen this man?
- No. You got police ID?

55:11.392 --> 55:14.560
She came over from Serbia
several years ago.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.813
She's working as a temp, right?

55:16.897 --> 55:18.898
Who's that? Family?

55:18.983 --> 55:22.026
Well, quite a few of them.
They came over here once.

55:22.111 --> 55:23.653
Did they?

55:26.115 --> 55:27.907
- Boyfriend?
- Brother.

55:31.286 --> 55:32.537
George.

55:33.414 --> 55:34.622
George?

55:36.583 --> 55:39.419
Take a look at this. I ain't got my bins.

55:45.926 --> 55:48.177
Who's the man in the picture?

55:51.765 --> 55:53.307
He came to the house recently.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.893
- How recently?
- Weeks.

55:57.146 --> 56:00.940
What's his name? Think. What's his name?

56:01.316 --> 56:02.817
I don't know.

57:03.170 --> 57:07.507
Fuck it. The wrong man.

57:12.638 --> 57:13.846
Fuck.

57:29.488 --> 57:31.155
You're free to go.

57:32.616 --> 57:35.701
- What are you talking about?
- Leave it, George.

57:39.081 --> 57:41.165
Please.

57:43.502 --> 57:46.921
Law states you've still got 15 minutes
to question me.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.799
Don't you want to use it?

57:49.967 --> 57:51.175
Please.

58:09.111 --> 58:10.945
I can only apologize.

58:16.243 --> 58:21.414
The ramifications of your careless actions
are gonna have severe repercussions, Regan.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.209
Are they?

58:30.674 --> 58:34.969
Simmonds. Show this dog off the premises.

58:42.519 --> 58:46.939
Let's go for a walk. I ought to throw you
out the fucking window, given the chance.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.030
I think I've found your weak point.

58:55.240 --> 58:58.743
No, you've found my glasses.

59:01.246 --> 59:03.497
It's where I found them that matters.

59:03.582 --> 59:05.374
Don't push me, Lewis.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.878
Not when I need a throat
to get my hands around.

59:10.130 --> 59:13.925
- Are you threatening me, Regan?
- No, I'm not threatening you.

59:19.473 --> 59:22.725
We were wrong. You stay away from me.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.126
He's under a lot of pressure.

59:49.211 --> 59:51.504
It's about to get a lot worse.

59:51.838 --> 59:54.173
Well, I apologize on his behalf.

59:54.591 --> 59:58.344
- I heard you applied for promotion, Carter.
- Yeah.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:01.931
You've got an impeccable record.
You know that?

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:07.311
Misdirected adolescent turns his back
on crime after a family tragedy.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.191
Accelerates through basic at Hendon
with honors.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:18.614
A guy like you could be
running the Sweeney in a few years.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.208
Makin Trebolt, you slag.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:34.922
Right. This is our man. Makin Trebolt.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:37.675
He's a Serb, ex-paramilitary.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.638
Wanted for robbery
across Switzerland, Italy, and France.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.474
Got an eye for killing witnesses.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.728
We believe he killed the girl
to cover his tracks.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:54.066
What she saw and what she heard
we still don't know,

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.985
but we will find out.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.572
- Have you got that?
- Yes, guv.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:01.741
Good.

01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:11.459
Mate, you look like shit.
You should go home and get some sleep.

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:17.590
Why didn't I see it coming, George?
Am I fucking losing it or what?

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:20.092
Look, we all thought it was Allen.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.845
Don't worry about it. Go and get some rest.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.181
- You're no good to us like this.
- Guv?

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:29.435
That private bank on Trafalgar Square
that you pulled Wextru off of.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:33.439
Well, a member of staff
has just triggered a hold-up alarm.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:35.608
It's Trebolt.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.732
Right. Everyone down in the compound
under a minute!

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:40.529
Check your weapons, your vests.
Armed robbery in progress!

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:44.116
Do not inform any other unit.
I don't want to spook him.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.202
With me. Armed robbery.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.912
- Is it Trafalgar Square?
- Yeah.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:51.749
Same bank Natalija Wolscat worked at
up until two weeks ago.

01:01:56.338 --> 01:02:01.300
Guv? I fucked up. You were right.
Allen had nothing to do with it.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.761
The man we're after is Makin Trebolt.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:06.764
There's a robbery in progress
at the pribate bank we pulled away from.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.391
Regan, stand down.
That's an order.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:09.875
We're less than three minutes away.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.269
I'm ordering you to stand down,
Regan, do you hear me?

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:15.815
Stay away.
Lewis made an official complaint about you.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.567
Don't give him an opportunity
to close us down.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.569
You hear me, Regan? Stand down.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.073
Fuck!

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.705
I've thought about what you said.

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.084
I'll do it.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.212
I'll come with you.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.426
Come here. Come here.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.100
Keep hold of it.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.912
Get off the fucking street.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:18.043
Armed police! Get on the floor!

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:22.756
- Armed police! Get on the floor!
- Get on the fucking floor!

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.970
Get on the fucking floor!
Get on the fucking floor right now!

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.473
Get on the fucking floor!

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:22.900
Move!

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:53.847
Move!

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.582
- Get down on the fucking floor!
- Go!

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.653
Fuck it!

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.030
Fuck!

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.254
- Police! Get on the ground!
- Get down!

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.723
Regan,
don't make this worse for yourself.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:02.434
Abandon your pursuit. That's an order!

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.253
Go!

01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:32.172
Ellis, take the right-hand door!

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:55.154
Stay there.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.995
Stay in your fucking room.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.955
- Get down. Sit.
- Stay down.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.442
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.611
Well, get yourself out of the way.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.527
Fuck it.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:18.821
Go!

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.004
Fuck.

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.848
Fuck!

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.263
Fuck it!

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.708
Nancy?

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.814
Get out of the fucking car! Get out!

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:19.895
Seberal people,
including a female police officer,

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:24.566
habe been shot dead after a bank
robbery went disastrously wrong

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.943
in London's most famous square.

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:30.280
The armed gang stole around £9 million.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:38.580
The gang, thought to be behind a number
of high-profile robberies across Europe,

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:42.667
ebaded capture,
despite a dramatic pursuit by police.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:43.794
Although it is thought

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:47.506
one of the men suffered
a serious gunshot wound to the neck.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:51.676
Police also want to question
Serbian national Makin Trebolt

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:56.181
in connection with the robbery,
as well as the murder of Natalija Wolscat,

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:59.768
who was killed earlier this week
in another armed raid.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:04.064
Zora Suleman reporting
from Trafalgar Square.

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.192
Janet?

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.300
Sorry for your loss.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:37.222
I'm sorry.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:42.227
I'm gonna destroy you, Regan.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:47.774
I'm gonna make sure
you never work in the police force again.

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:52.112
I'm freezing your bank accounts,
I'm freezing your assets, your home,

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:53.780
your whole life.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:15:00.245
I hold you alone responsible
for what happened,

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.499
for my wife.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.837
You're a dinosaur.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:12.591
You're extinct.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:18.597
And there's no place for a man like you
in our community.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:27.522
Your unit's suspended
pending further investigation.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:32.611
If you approach any witnesses
or suspects associated with this case,

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:35.447
I'll have you arrested
and remanded immediately.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.866
I'm assigning a team to monitor you
around the clock,

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.368
so you think about making a move,

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:43.914
you think again.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.626
Because I'm gonna be there.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.339
I want your gun and your badge
until the investigation's over.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.466
Your mobile phone as well.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.117
If I didn't believe in the law, I'd...

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:29.042
The next time I see you,
I won't show the same restraint.

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:11.876
What are you doing here?
I thought you was in hospital.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.628
You thought wrong.

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:16.673
You coming? Come on. Let's go.

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:21.720
- Go where?
- Trebolt.

01:17:22.013 --> 01:17:24.264
The unit's been suspended, you know that.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.391
So just me and you, then.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:28.226
No.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.689
- Haskins has ordered me to stay away.
- Did he?

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.362
I can't risk my job. I can't.

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:41.990
Not with Megan the way she is.
You know I can't.

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.992
- Lose your job?
- Yeah.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:46.578
You wouldn't have a fucking job
if it weren't for me.

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:50.749
You'd still be a two-bob thief
on the estate sticking brown up your...

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.460
I worked fucking hard to be in this squad.

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:57.464
You may have shown me the fucking door,
but I'm the one had to walk through it.

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:00.342
You think I ain't hurting?
You think I ain't fucking hurting?

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:02.719
I lost a valuable fucking member
of my team today.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:07.057
It don't matter how I feel,
'cause I weren't the one was fucking her!

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.936
Why didn't you protect her, Jack?

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.691
She should have been protected.

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:17.859
Fuck!

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.910
I was stuck in a car.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.622
I couldn't move. I couldn't help her.

01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.791
What could I fucking do?

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:39.339
I can't live like this. I just need your help.
I'm on the fucking ropes here.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.058
We're being watched.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:52.519
- Where?
- On the roadside.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:04.823
Hello, son.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.826
Come here.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:11.162
- Got a mobile on you?
- Yeah.

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:13.790
Well, get your mobile
and take a smudge of me.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.333
Go on, then.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:16.918
What happened to your face?

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:23.174
Give that to Harry. Tell
him to meet me here.

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:26.845
In the Crow's Nest.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:33.351
I want a gun and a badge.

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:40.692
I've never asked you for anything, George.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:11.533
It's a bad business, this.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:15.203
They played me, Harry.
Made me look fucking ordinary.

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.789
Well, there's nothing
ordinary about you, pal.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:22.460
- Where did it all go so fucking wrong?
- You didn't. But they didn't either.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.673
- Who told you about the bank?
- A friend of a friend.

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:30.385
Some Eastern Bloc trigger man
with loose lips.

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:33.680
More chance of finding a bit of class
in Deptford.

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:36.599
Here.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:44.065
That's very good. You got the yogga?

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.945
This is all I could lay my paws on.

01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:51.531
That'll do.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.909
Yeah. I stuck a 9-mil in one of 'em.

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:57.453
He won't be getting far
with an untreated gunshot wound.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.497
I need you to do me a favor, Harry.

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:04.085
I need you to check hospitals, like Bupa
clinics, vets, and quacks, that sort of thing.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.712
Find 'em, Jack.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.798
Yeah, I will.

01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:37.744
Who's Makin Trebolt?

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:43.291
I told Carter. I don't talk to the police.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:45.877
I ain't the fucking police no more.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.962
Now, who's Makin Trebolt?

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:50.673
What's his connection to Allen?

01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:52.759
I told you in the cells.

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.511
I went to Allen's for a barbecue.

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:59.557
- Wrong fucking answer.
- No, no, don't!

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:09.567
He paid me... He paid... Allen paid me!

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.527
- He paid me.
- For what?

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:14.489
To take his passport out of the country.

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:19.869
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.789
- I said...
- God! Please!

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:25.416
- Where the fuck is he now?
- Oh, fuck!

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:29.003
I can't tell you, 'cause I don't know.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:43.851
Now, you tell him I'm coming after him.
I'm fucking coming after all of them.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:56.989
Regan!

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:01.494
We've got orders to search you.
Now empty your pockets.

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:05.790
Come here.

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:07.792
Fuck!

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:13.965
Yeah, that's the language
you understand, isn't it?

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:16.592
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of witness intimidation.

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:18.553
- You have the right to remain...
- You ain't a fucking man!

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:20.012
You bastard!

01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:24.183
Cuff him.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.302
The promotion you applied for...

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.681
I'm not in the market no more.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:50.561
You wanna waste your time
with false loyalties,

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.690
or be of real value to your community?

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:59.987
Redundant camaraderie
or fulfilled potential?

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:02.281
It's a simple choice, Carter.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.578
This is my direct line and my mobile.

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:12.416
You call me when you're ready to become
the man you're capable of being.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:46.576
I know what I'd do if I was you.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:52.498
My inmates are so excited about your
arrival we had to lock down the wing.

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:58.004
Funny to think
on the outside people look up to you,

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:00.923
but in here you're my most hated prisoner.

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:03.509
You make sex cases look popular.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:08.097
Truth is, you should be on the rule in seg,

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:12.810
not on normal courtyard exercise,
for your own safety.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.439
But we haven't got the space.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:21.319
So you'll have to stay on the open wing
till we can transfer you.

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:24.280
All right. Open up.

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.040
Here he is.

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:28.886
- How's the leg, Harry?
- It still bloody hurts.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.516
Tell my friend here what you know.

01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:39.271
Got a call this afternoon,
asking if I could treat a gunshot wound.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.357
For cash.

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:45.820
- Do you know where he is?
- I sure do.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.906
I operated on him an hour ago.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:52.159
Pulled this from his collarbone.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:56.080
- What's his condition?
- Shot.

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:00.793
Regan did it.

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:04.422
There's a taxi cab office
on the next street along.

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:08.884
But in the back they sell crack and heroin.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.346
He's recuperating in the apartment.

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:18.019
I wouldn't go in there blazing.

01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:21.063
He's not alone.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:26.277
- Bernard.
- Take care, Harry.

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:02.688
- Mini Cabs.
- Yes, I'm with a dozen or so friends,

01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:04.982
and we need to get into Soho.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:09.236
Could you tell me how many drivers
you have at base at the moment?

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:16.202
Neil? Neil. It's Uncle Jack.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.580
Listen, I need to speak to Daddy, kid.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.540
He's gone, Uncle Jack.

01:30:21.625 --> 01:30:22.833
Well, where is he?

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.210
I don't know.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:27.671
Listen, Neil, I gotta talk to him.
Get a message to him from me.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:28.798
It's very important.

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:31.092
Allen never left the country.

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:34.428
Funny place to bump into each other.

01:30:34.513 --> 01:30:36.388
- Gotta laugh?
- Yeah.

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:39.660
Where is he?

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:42.580
Where the fuck is he?

01:31:44.374 --> 01:31:46.417
At home with your wife.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.659
Fucking hell!

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:14.046
You've been busy, ain't you, mate?

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:17.466
Nice little diversion you set up, yeah,
when you saw we was onto the bank.

01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:20.302
Very clever. Almost pulled it off as well.

01:33:20.387 --> 01:33:23.347
Just one thing you didn't
take into account.

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:25.724
Me, you cunt.

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:30.312
Now, I'm gonna ask you a question.
You answer it if you want to live.

01:33:30.397 --> 01:33:32.273
Where's Trebolt going?

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:39.947
I ain't fucking about with you, mate!

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:41.791
A friend of mine is over
there on your wall,

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:43.867
he's in a spot of bother
and I ain't about to let him down,

01:33:43.952 --> 01:33:47.788
so you better tell me what the fuck
I want to know or I will shoot you.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:50.582
Answer me! Where's he fucking going?

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:53.460
In English, motherfucker.
I don't speak your language.

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:55.629
- Home.
- How's he getting there?

01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.673
- Boat.
- What boat? Where?

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.552
Gravesend. Pegasus.

01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:04.805
Gravesend. The Pegasus.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.892
That wasn't too difficult, was it?

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:14.857
This is for Nancy.

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:17.401
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:22.489
- Calm down. I'm police.
- Don't talk! Just drop the gun!

01:34:22.574 --> 01:34:25.075
I'm Officer George Carter
from the Flying Squad.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.660
Keep your hands behind your head!

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:29.580
Go in my pocket and you will find my badge.

01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:36.253
Lower your weapons, boys.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:43.969
Got a report that an ID was seen
assembling a firearm in a nearby vehicle.

01:34:47.766 --> 01:34:50.601
Gotta say I'm disappointed
it was you, Carter.

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:53.020
Yeah, well, it weren't
gonna be Regan, was it?

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:58.984
There's your man.

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:29.473
Haskins. You can't shut up shop now.

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:34.957
I told you, I know where Trebolt's at,
I know where he's going.

01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:37.773
I just annihilated four geezers
to get you that information

01:35:37.857 --> 01:35:39.178
and you don't even wanna hear it!

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:40.901
Take it easy, Carter.

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:44.405
I just got you off the hook
and it won't happen again.

01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:46.990
I'm all out of favors.

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:52.204
You can take all your intelligence
down to the NCI when they interview you.

01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:55.624
Haskins, come on!

01:35:56.626 --> 01:36:00.754
You're just gonna leave Jack in prison?
Locked up like a criminal?

01:36:02.841 --> 01:36:04.591
What about the Sweeney?
What about Regan? Come on.

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:08.429
You're starting to sound a lot like him.
And you're better than that.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:11.181
You got a big future ahead of you
if you can just keep your bloody head down.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.517
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.727
Look at the way he's ended up.

01:36:15.812 --> 01:36:18.439
Is that what you want?
To become like Regan?

01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:21.275
You know fuck-all about what I want,
what's best for my future.

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:22.943
I'm my own man.

01:36:23.403 --> 01:36:26.196
I didn't join the police
to be some constable out on the beat

01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:28.157
or to sit behind a desk.

01:36:28.241 --> 01:36:30.868
I became police to be in the Sweeney.

01:36:31.828 --> 01:36:35.706
So if there's no Sweeney,
there is no Officer George Carter.

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:39.877
Come here, Carter.

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:42.254
Carter! I'm talking to you!

01:36:44.716 --> 01:36:46.216
What's Pegasus?

01:36:50.597 --> 01:36:53.140
It's the name of Allen's boat. Why?

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.608
Pig, it turns out you've got a friend.

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:08.423
How the fuck did you manage that?

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:12.594
I couldn't believe it,
they had fucking pictures.

01:38:12.679 --> 01:38:15.264
Hundreds of pictures of us. They've been
watching us the whole fucking time.

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:16.682
We walked right into this.

01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:19.184
Trebolt blew the safe in the jewelers
to make it look like Allen,

01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:22.396
'cause he knew we'd go after him.
That's why it was so easy to find him.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.773
We had him cuffed in a cell
and we let him walk.

01:38:24.857 --> 01:38:28.360
I knew Francis Allen was involved.
We had him on a fucking plate.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:30.946
It's Haskins.

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:32.739
I'm listening.

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:35.158
The Pegasus has already entered
British waters.

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.995
Repeat, Allen's boat is already here.

01:38:39.205 --> 01:38:42.040
And, Jack? I'm sorry.

01:39:30.632 --> 01:39:32.424
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:35.469
Well, let's have it.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:11.421
You go to the front.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.142
Fuck me.

01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:23.577
I knew you'd take the bait, Regan.
All I had to do was dangle a carrot.

01:41:24.871 --> 01:41:27.164
Fucker!

01:41:28.499 --> 01:41:30.584
- Mug!
- You're such an easy target.

01:41:30.668 --> 01:41:33.336
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.

01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:53.231
Fuck. George!

01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:22.552
George, cover me!

01:43:55.146 --> 01:43:56.813
Move, move, move!

01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:09.172
You're nicked.
