WEBVTT

00:36.520 --> 00:38.040
It's half past five.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.560
How the hell do you do that?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.320
What?

00:46.840 --> 00:49.520
Know what time it is
when your eyes are shut?

00:52.080 --> 00:53.120
I just do.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.640
-Hm.
-Why are you up so early?

00:59.840 --> 01:02.880
You know, you could let me keep
a couple of clean shirts here.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.320
Then I could stay
and make you breakfast.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.120
Don't push it.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.320
Or at least stop
throwing away my toothbrushes.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.720
-Morning, ma'am.
-Morning, CJ.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.840
Thanks.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.800
Sylvia Fox's
office, how can I help?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.440
Felicity's office called.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.640
The meeting's started.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.600
I thought it was at00.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.360
Seems they moved it up.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.840
And you can get away early
tonight.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.360
Buy that gift?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.800
Sylvia, it's your
niece's wedding.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.320
I'm not sure I'm going.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.520
Tricky time to take leave.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.440
Ah, Sylvia,
thank you for joining.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.840
You know Imgone Blake
from the Foreign Office?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.640
Yes, of course.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.200
Imogen, would
you bring Sylvia up to speed?

02:55.360 --> 02:57.360
As you're aware, we've been
working hard to improve

02:57.520 --> 02:59.840
diplomatic relations
with the Emirate of Hezrah,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.280
as part of that initiative
we've agreed to share certain,

03:03.440 --> 03:05.600
limited, intelligence
with their authorities.

03:05.760 --> 03:06.600
How limited?

03:06.760 --> 03:08.520
Terrorism related issues
essentially.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.840
The Hezrahni regime makes
no distinction

03:11.000 --> 03:12.440
between terrorists
and dissidents.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.840
We see recent changes
at the top in Hezrah

03:15.000 --> 03:16.360
as grounds for optimism.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.280
Do you? I don't.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.360
The new guard is basically
the old guard

03:20.520 --> 03:22.480
in smarter suits
and speaking better English.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.960
-I'm not here to argue.
-Of course you aren't, dear.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.120
You're with the Foreign Office.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.120
There'll be nothing handed over
that compromises

03:29.280 --> 03:30.600
any of my sources?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.120
Their identities
will of course remain secret.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.760
That's not enough.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.880
I need sight of everything
that goes to the Hezrahnis,

03:37.040 --> 03:39.640
so that it can't be traced back
to any of my people.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.360
-Not possible I'm afraid.
-It's not up to you, is it?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.320
You're seriously prepared to
expose my assets--

03:46.480 --> 03:48.000
-To the risk of--
-Your assets?

03:48.160 --> 03:51.480
I'm standing down the Hezrahni
operation, as of now.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.520
I'll get out there tonight
and start closing it down.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.880
No. You're management now.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.800
Which means sitting behind
a desk and managing,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.080
not dashing across
time zones on a whim.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.800
Can't just--

04:06.960 --> 04:08.840
And there must be no contact
with the individuals involved

04:09.000 --> 04:11.360
without my specific
authorization.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.400
Sylvia, wait. Come on.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.440
That was an ambush,
and you led me straight into it.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.560
So that's why
you were up at dawn.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.640
We couldn't jeopardize
the negotiations.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.080
You don't trust me?

04:26.240 --> 04:28.080
Hah. I used to be married
to you, remember?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.400
What's that supposed to mean?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.240
It means I know you.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.320
I know that you put
your loyalty to your agents

04:33.480 --> 04:36.880
above everything else.
Including your career.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.240
Why am I even surprised by this?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.880
Dame Felicity wrote
the fucking book on betrayal.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.080
Just, uh, just breathe.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.840
Don't patronize me, Adam.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.640
I had enough of that
in there.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.640
Look, I'll come over later.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.160
We'll talk.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.360
Tomorrow then.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.280
I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm taking a few days leave.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.800
Wait, wait, wait. You're not
going to Hezrah I hope.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
I'm not that stupid.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.440
Well, so where are you going?

05:06.600 --> 05:09.720
You're a bloody spy, Adam.
You work it out.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.800
Welcome.
Isabel, your sister is here.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.560
Hi.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.240
You made it!

09:32.400 --> 09:33.720
Of course I did.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.240
We're up here.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.360
Sylvia.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.320
-Hah. Matteo.
-Sylvia.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.560
So wonderful
to see you here at last.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.360
What about a Negroni, huh?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.760
Ah, Isabel,
I like your husband a lot.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.280
-This is for you.
-Grazie.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.640
Here, my dear.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.600
So, let's start
as we mean to go on, hm?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.040
-Hm.
-Hm.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.920
Hm. Hmm.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.240
This place is incredible.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.760
I can't believe you actually
live here. Ha-ha-ha.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.120
It's been in Matteo's family
nearly 200 years.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.160
I can't believe you are
seeing it for the first time.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.320
Yeah, well, we've invited her
often enough.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.440
Hm.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.240
Anyway, you need to change.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.880
Yeah, we're going out to eat
with all the family.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.880
-Oh, wonderful. Heh.
-Yeah. Heh.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.240
You look so well.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.960
-Hmm-hmm.
-And happy.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.920
Of course she does.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.760
She married an Italian.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.680
Anyway, come on,
I'll show you your room.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.600
Is that her?

11:54.760 --> 11:56.800
-Matteo's mother?
-Hm.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
Welcome.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.680
Sylvia, my mother.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.120
Stop it. I'll tell you later,
don't worry, don't worry.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.760
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Italian mothers.

12:08.920 --> 12:09.960
Please.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.520
That's not
the story that she told me.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.560
I can't believe you did that.
That's amazing.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.640
Alice and Tommaso
should be here by now.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.120
They are young and in love,
Isabella. Don't fuss.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.760
My sister didn't tell me

12:21.920 --> 12:23.920
that you were such a romantic,
SignoraVitale.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.480
Antonella, please.
You're family.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.400
I'm glad you came.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.120
Isabella did not think
you would.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.400
Mama.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.200
Couldn't miss
my niece's wedding.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.680
Ah, they're here.
Aah. Hey.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.800
Ah, you made it!

12:41.960 --> 12:45.400
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

12:45.560 --> 12:48.320
This is my Aunt Sylvia,
and this is my Tommaso.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.480
Lovely.
Lovely to meet you, Sylvia.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.960
And you.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.040
Alice told me all about her
favorite aunt.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.800
Her only aunt. Heh.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.160
But she hasn't told me nearly
enough about you. Come.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.400
Is that so?

13:00.560 --> 13:02.600
-Mama, you look gorgeous.
-Isabel.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.800
Good to see you.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.200
You did not come
when Matteo married Isabella.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.240
I was working
in the Middle East.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.520
You have a very important job.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.800
I'm a civil servant,
it's very boring.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.720
-What do you do?
-Me?

13:21.880 --> 13:23.960
-Hm.
-I am a notario.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.600
Like a lawyer but less money.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.920
-Which is not true.
-Also very boring.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.440
That's true.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
-We should order.
-Yes.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.960
Do you want me to translate
the menu for you?

13:40.840 --> 13:44.000
Then, Sylvia,
you should order mm...

13:45.480 --> 13:48.800
Umberto cooks it
almost as well as I do.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.280
See, when Mama's around
we don't need menus.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.000
Hey! Ha-ha-ha.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.240
-Cheers.
-Chin-chin.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.360
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.840
Oh, more emotion than that.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.920
Antonella, this is delicious,
you were right.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.720
Go on, admit it.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.840
You'd have been just as happy
with fish fingers.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.600
Fingers? Fingers what?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.240
Oh, Madonna!

14:10.400 --> 14:11.560
Mum was right though.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.000
Sylvia's freezer
is full of them.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.360
How would you know?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.280
There is nothing wrong
with fish fingers.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.200
I appreciate good food,
I just can't cook it.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.120
-It's not true.
-It is true.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.600
You poor girl.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.240
It's nothing to laugh about.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.760
So...

15:11.920 --> 15:14.720
So you spent a lot of time
together in London, huh?

15:14.880 --> 15:16.760
That's nice.
I didn't know that.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.080
I took the starving student
out for dinner occasionally.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.760
Really?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.760
Yeah, the exhibitions,
restaurants, we got around.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.640
We had some adventures.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.040
-How did you meet Tommaso?
-Oh, yes, tell the story.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.800
-Oh, well now, I mean--
-Sorry.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.640
Sylvia was
just asking me how we met.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.200
Oh, she did?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.600
Um, so...

15:35.760 --> 15:37.040
You remember
when I was waitressing

15:37.200 --> 15:38.880
at that restaurant in Perugia?

15:39.040 --> 15:41.160
So, I was working one night
and Tommaso came in

15:41.320 --> 15:42.440
and I served him.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.520
-And, she forgot half my order.
-Stop!

15:45.680 --> 15:48.400
So, I came back the next night
and the one after,

15:48.560 --> 15:51.240
just to see how long it would
take her to get it right.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.720
I knew something was up
when Alice said

15:54.880 --> 15:57.200
she wasn't coming back to London
and wouldn't tell me why.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.160
I was afraid
you might disapprove.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.000
Disapprove? Of me?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.400
No, of me.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.120
For picking a man
over a master's degree.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.280
Well, lucky for me she did.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.200
She made me believe in myself.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.360
Aah.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.520
What about after the wedding?
What are your plans?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.240
God, I haven't really thought
beyond the honeymoon.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.640
-Have you?
-Crete.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.080
Tommaso's booked the most
fantastic villa.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.800
Can you show them the pictures?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.440
Look Alice,
your friends are here.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.760
Ah.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.440
We're gonna get a quick drink.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.000
Sylvia, do you wanna join us?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.520
No, you go
and have a great time.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.040
-Okay.
-I'll come.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.240
-Yes.
-Yes.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.640
It was a real pleasure.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.120
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.040
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.520
Did Tommaso pass the test?

16:58.680 --> 17:00.480
Well, he seems delightful.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.200
They're very much in love
you know.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.600
I can see that.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.760
But?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.440
But nothing.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.440
Are you okay, my love, you sure?

18:37.760 --> 18:40.600
DV 079FD.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.000
It's lovely.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.760
Do you like him?

19:16.360 --> 19:19.160
He's handsome, charming,
and he adores you.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.400
And your dress is beautiful.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.560
But it's not me though. Is it?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.320
It's in here somewhere, ah.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.400
It's an old one of mum's.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.320
Do you think she'll mind
if I wear it tomorrow?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.680
Oh.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.560
I don't think
she'll mind at all.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.360
Mum!

21:20.520 --> 21:22.200
There's no hot water!

21:22.360 --> 21:23.600
-Mum!
-Matteo.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.960
I heard you.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.200
I'm coming!

22:00.880 --> 22:02.560
Sylvia.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.880
It's so lovely.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.880
What was wrong with the church?

22:09.040 --> 22:11.480
Alice isn't a catholic,
you know that.

22:11.640 --> 22:12.600
Hm.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.080
Alice seems so happy
that Matteo's giving her away.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.400
He's been more of a father
to her than Richard ever was.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.520
Who's here from Tommaso's side?

22:34.680 --> 22:36.640
Oh, he...

22:36.800 --> 22:38.520
He hasn't anyone really.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.080
His parents are both dead.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.680
And there's a sister in Canada.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.480
That's a shame.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.360
Is that his best man?

22:50.480 --> 22:53.880
Yeah. Franco.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.560
He's a-a neighbor, I think.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.920
Why, Sylv?

23:00.080 --> 23:01.960
-Hm?
-Why?

23:02.120 --> 23:03.760
Where's the groom?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.600
He should be here by now.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.720
I'll just go and talk to Franco.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.440
Um, Franco...

23:29.200 --> 23:30.160
What-what are you doing?

23:30.320 --> 23:32.000
Darling, darling.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.040
Wait, darling. Darling!

23:37.520 --> 23:38.880
Alice, wait!

23:47.200 --> 23:48.440
Wait, please.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.680
Something's happened,
hasn't it?

23:53.160 --> 23:54.360
Is Tommaso dead?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.360
No, of course not.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.160
Alice, call him.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.760
Okay.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.640
The number you've dialed
is not--

24:11.800 --> 24:14.160
-No.
-Matteo, try.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.240
Who knows, maybe he...

24:26.400 --> 24:28.200
Alice, are there
any other friends

24:28.360 --> 24:30.400
of Tommaso's you can contact?

24:30.560 --> 24:33.120
Well, I really think
we should call the police.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.520
-No.
-Why not, darling?

24:34.680 --> 24:36.800
And if there has been
an accident and if--

24:36.960 --> 24:38.520
And if there hasn't?
What do we say?

24:38.680 --> 24:40.920
That I was dumped at the altar?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.360
He lives in Magione,
doesn't he?

24:45.520 --> 24:46.560
You give me the address
and I'll go and--

24:46.720 --> 24:49.480
No, no, no. Please, just...
Just leave it.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.560
Please.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.280
How could he
do this to her?

25:00.520 --> 25:02.840
-I call the Carabinieri.
-No, don't.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.360
I think you should let Alice
decide how to handle this.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.200
You have
arrived at your destination.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.880
Hm.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
-Alice?
-What are you doing here?

29:35.840 --> 29:38.560
The same thing as you.
He's not here.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.640
Jesus, is that blood?

29:46.160 --> 29:48.200
How did you get here?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.000
-I--
-How did you get here, Alice?

29:50.160 --> 29:51.600
My scooter, I--

29:51.760 --> 29:53.440
You get back on your bike
and you go straight home.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.280
You talk to no one
and you were never here, okay?

29:56.440 --> 29:57.760
-Okay? Go.
-Yeah.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.880
Hi, boss.

30:06.040 --> 30:09.160
Shouldn't you be dancing with
a tall, dark, Italian stranger?

30:09.320 --> 30:10.600
There's been a slight hitch.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.440
Listen, this is strictly
under the radar.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.560
I've got some prints
I need ID'd.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.040
I'm on it.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.320
SignoraSylvia Fox?

30:42.480 --> 30:44.560
Yes. Who are you?

30:47.200 --> 30:48.440
This is your house?

30:48.600 --> 30:50.520
If it was my house
I would have let you in

30:50.680 --> 30:52.440
rather than leaving you
to break down the gate.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.760
What are you doing here?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.320
The man who lives here
was supposed to

30:55.480 --> 30:56.920
marry my niece today.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.840
He didn't turn up,
so, I came to look for him.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.760
How did you get in?

31:01.920 --> 31:03.560
I climbed over the wall.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.400
And you saw the body
from here?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.080
Bird watcher.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.240
I always travel
with binoculars.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.120
At least the signoradidn't
waste her journey.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.600
I think that's an osprey.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.320
Too small.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.200
Probably a seagull.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.920
Hm.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.360
Are you English?

31:31.520 --> 31:34.200
-Yes.
-And you found her?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.920
Where is your
niece, SignoraFox?

31:37.080 --> 31:38.880
At her parents' house
in Panicale.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.560
-She didn't come with you?
-No.

31:55.800 --> 31:56.960
The signorashould leave now,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.920
so we can search
through the property.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.320
What were you going
to say to SignorRossi

32:01.480 --> 32:03.280
if he would have been home?

32:03.440 --> 32:05.440
Or do to him?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.200
-I hadn't quite decided.
-Hm.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.240
Rabia?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.120
I have a match
on the fingerprints.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.520
That was fast. Does she have
a criminal record?

32:24.680 --> 32:26.080
No,
but she's entered the States

32:26.240 --> 32:28.400
a couple of times.
Laura Boscolo.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.280
Italian national,
born Civitavecchia 1986.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.200
Now resident in Perugia.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.880
Laura Boscolo. Thanks.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.560
Look, I don't know
what's going on out there.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.680
But do you need me to send
in a clean-up crew?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.080
No, it's okay.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.000
I covered my tracks
before I called the police.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.280
Speaking of which,
can you get me background

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
on a Carabinieri officer,

32:49.600 --> 32:51.560
CapitanoGiovanni Riva.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.560
R-I-V-A.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.080
Based in Umbria,
probably Perugia.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.800
Thanks, Rabia.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.720
This morning...

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
when you found out Tommaso
hadn't arrived...

33:07.040 --> 33:09.360
you thought he was dead, why?

33:10.720 --> 33:13.040
I don't know,
I was panicking.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.840
The blood. Is it his?

33:17.320 --> 33:19.240
There was a woman's body
in the lake.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.320
Now we've only got a few minutes
before the police arrive.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.400
So, you need to talk to me.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.800
Does the name Laura Boscolo
mean anything to you?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.800
-No. Hm.
-Sure?

33:31.960 --> 33:34.960
And you've had no word from him,
from either of his mobiles?

33:35.120 --> 33:37.400
-No.
-Okay.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.000
You weren't at Tommaso's house.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.760
You haven't seen me
since this morning.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.480
You know nothing about the body
or about Tommaso's whereabouts.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.720
You haven't heard from him
and you're devastated.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.120
I am devastated.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.040
And how much you know
about Mr. Rossi's work?

33:57.200 --> 34:00.200
Tommaso is a registered notario,
he has an office in Perugia.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.640
Did Tommaso ever introduce you
to any of his clients?

34:02.800 --> 34:04.280
No, why?

34:05.840 --> 34:08.200
And you're sure
you don't recognize

34:08.360 --> 34:09.600
the woman in this photograph?

34:09.760 --> 34:11.520
Never seen her
before in my life.

34:13.200 --> 34:17.720
That body has nothing
to do with me or with Tommaso.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.400
You can only make the promise
for yourself, signorina.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.000
But not for SignorRossi.

34:23.160 --> 34:25.800
So, tell me
again, when was the last time

34:25.960 --> 34:27.840
you met SignorRossi?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.320
Um,
the night before our wedding.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.120
That evening...

34:32.280 --> 34:33.360
Giovanni Riva.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.880
Worked out of the Bari Command
for 20 years.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.560
He was moved to the regional
crime office

34:37.720 --> 34:39.360
in Perugia a year ago.

34:39.520 --> 34:42.000
Doesn't sound like a promotion.
Is he bad news?

34:42.160 --> 34:44.240
Sorry, Sylvia,
that's all I've got.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.160
-SignoraFox.
-Hello again.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.240
-Have you found SignorRossi?
-Not yet.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.280
Has the dead woman been
identified?

35:03.440 --> 35:05.160
If you don't mind me asking.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.520
Do you recognize her?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.040
No.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.520
But I think you did.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.480
Are you a doctor, signora?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.440
-Or maybe a police officer?
-Neither.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.200
Most people
panic at the sight of

35:21.360 --> 35:23.120
dead bodies,
but you were very calm.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.560
I never got that close.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.800
Oh, of course, the binoculars.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.720
Right.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.880
Well, goodbye, SignoraFox.

35:32.040 --> 35:34.120
Or should I say SignoraVolpe?

35:35.280 --> 35:36.280
Hm.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.040
Sounds better in Italian.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.600
Everything sounds better
in Italian.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
Hm.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.680
Where did you
disappear to earlier?

36:20.840 --> 36:23.280
I drove up into the hills,
went for a walk.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.680
You know they've found
a woman's body

36:24.840 --> 36:26.320
in the lake
near Tommaso's house?

36:26.480 --> 36:29.000
Yes, the Carabinieri officer
outside told me.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.560
Well, I can't believe Tommaso
had anything to do with it.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.080
If he didn't,
where is he now?

36:40.480 --> 36:41.760
How's Alice?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.040
How do you think?

36:54.080 --> 36:56.360
Sylvia?

36:57.400 --> 36:58.440
Are you okay?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.000
That's her isn't it?

37:00.160 --> 37:02.560
The woman they found
at Tommaso's house?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.080
Let's see?

37:08.760 --> 37:11.080
That's the Gazzetta di Perugia.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.280
I remember that night, Tommaso
said he had a work thing

37:13.440 --> 37:15.400
but that I couldn't go.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.080
And I was upset because it was
our three month anniversary.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.600
Who is she to him?

38:11.560 --> 38:12.800
Signora?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.000
Can I have a table
for one please?

38:16.160 --> 38:18.920
Sorry, we're fully booked.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.480
A birthday party, 30 children.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.760
Believe me,
you don't want to be here.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.120
Well, that's great to see
that you're doing so well.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.920
I was on the EU subcommittee
that approved your funding?

38:29.080 --> 38:30.480
Now I feel terrible.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.360
Maybe you could come back
another day? Please?

38:33.520 --> 38:37.440
Let me know you are coming and
we'll treat you like a queen.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.440
I think it's wonderful
what you're doing,

38:39.600 --> 38:42.600
training up so many
disadvantaged young people.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.520
And, I so enjoyed meeting
your co-owner, um...

38:45.680 --> 38:49.200
Laura Boscolo,
when we did the funding panel?

38:49.360 --> 38:51.240
I'd like to get in touch
with her again.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.120
I wonder if I could
have her number?

38:54.280 --> 38:57.480
Uh, sorry, I'm not permitted
to give out personal numbers.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.040
You understand, signora?

38:59.200 --> 39:02.280
Carson, Dawn Carson.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.000
Perhaps I could give you mine?

39:04.880 --> 39:06.160
Of course.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.440
-Grazie.
-Thank you.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.840
Could I speak to
Carla Galli, please?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.600
Yes, who's this?

39:46.760 --> 39:49.240
SignoraGalli,
my name is Sylvia Fox.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.360
I've been reading
some of your articles.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.640
And I wanted to ask you
about a Laura Boscolo?

39:56.320 --> 39:58.040
Sorry, I'm not interested.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.800
Oh, do you need some help?

41:03.960 --> 41:05.640
I'm-I'm okay, thanks.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.520
You're Carla Galli aren't you?

41:10.680 --> 41:12.680
My name's Sylvia,
I called you earlier.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.600
Please.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.080
I just need a moment.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.480
What do you want?

41:22.640 --> 41:24.400
You hung up on me.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.840
Was it because I mentioned
Laura Boscolo?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.400
Look, I've only
just started working

41:28.560 --> 41:30.280
and I don't have time
to speak to every person

41:30.440 --> 41:31.960
who thinks they have a story.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.840
You had an accident?

41:34.000 --> 41:37.920
Six months ago. The doctors say
I may even walk again one day.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.440
I'm sorry.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.200
Did you know that Laura Boscolo
has been murdered?

41:43.880 --> 41:45.400
Yes.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.960
Her body was found very close
to the house of a man

41:47.120 --> 41:48.560
named Tommaso Rossi.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.920
My niece was due
to marry Rossi yesterday.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.400
But he didn't turn up.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.840
Look, I've never heard of
Tommaso Rossi.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.240
But, if he had anything to do
with Laura Boscolo,

41:58.400 --> 42:00.840
your niece has had
a lucky escape.

43:35.640 --> 43:38.080
Oh, I'm so sorry, let me help.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.920
I didn't see you there.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.360
I'm really sorry.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.800
No.

45:46.040 --> 45:49.240
Ah, SignoraVolpe.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.440
Have you found another body?

45:52.600 --> 45:55.960
No. But I did find these,

45:56.120 --> 45:57.840
they're from my sister's garden.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.320
Oh, thank you.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.120
Please, sit.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.920
I wondered if there was
any news about Tommaso Rossi?

46:07.040 --> 46:10.320
No, but if Alice hears from him,

46:11.880 --> 46:13.480
will you tell me?

46:13.640 --> 46:15.160
I don't think she has.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.480
I believe that you work for
the UK government, signora?

46:20.640 --> 46:22.920
-Hm.
-Doing what?

46:23.080 --> 46:26.680
Agricultural exports.
Negotiations mainly.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.760
Hm, but that sounds very
straight forward

46:29.920 --> 46:32.040
for someone with
your security clearance.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.880
I met Carla Galli.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.800
Galli? Yeah, good journalist.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.880
It's just terrible
what happened to her.

46:44.320 --> 46:47.000
-The accident.
-Was it an accident?

46:47.160 --> 46:49.800
Well, we found
no proof of criminality.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.880
So, you did investigate?

46:52.040 --> 46:53.720
The brakes of her
car failed,

46:53.880 --> 46:56.360
but we did not
find anything else.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.600
I mean, what did
SignoraGalli tell you?

47:03.080 --> 47:08.120
CapitanoRiva, should I be
worried for my niece?

47:10.160 --> 47:15.680
You should take care, signora,
for your family and yourself.

47:30.320 --> 47:34.680
Hello? Ciao, I was given
your number by a friend.

47:34.840 --> 47:38.160
I'm looking for something to
take to a Christening party.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.000
I wondered if you could help?

47:42.160 --> 47:43.800
Today if possible.

48:10.800 --> 48:14.120
-Are you Raffaella?
-Yes, and you?

48:14.280 --> 48:15.640
Miss Francis.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.720
Oh, yes, the special order?
A Christening party, right?

48:20.880 --> 48:22.400
That's right.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.560
So, what do you need?

48:26.840 --> 48:29.080
An electronic tag
for a mobile phone.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.760
I have a shadow tracker,
will that do?

48:33.920 --> 48:35.160
Yes.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.720
Okay, good.

48:36.880 --> 48:38.560
Your phone please?

48:45.120 --> 48:46.880
Thank you.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.680
Okay. You got the software now.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.200
Thanks.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.600
You know how it works?

49:11.760 --> 49:14.800
I access the OS of the target
device then use this code?

49:14.960 --> 49:18.920
Exactly. It will give you a
location to within ten meters,

49:19.080 --> 49:22.000
plus access to all data
from the host device,

49:22.160 --> 49:23.320
and you can listen in to calls.

49:23.480 --> 49:24.800
Perfect.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.960
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

49:30.360 --> 49:31.680
Possibly.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.640
I thought you gave
that up years ago?

50:56.800 --> 50:58.280
Filthy art school habit.

50:58.440 --> 50:59.720
I've gone from hiding it
from mum

50:59.880 --> 51:01.400
to hiding it from Matteo.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.760
How's Alice?

51:04.920 --> 51:08.720
I think she's scared Tommaso
might have killed that woman.

51:08.880 --> 51:10.760
And that he might be dead too.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.120
Buenos Aires?

52:22.320 --> 52:25.640
-Come on, come on.
-Ow! Ow! Ah!

52:36.560 --> 52:38.440
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.040
Just stepped on a pistachio
shell in the hall.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.600
-Ouch.
-Yeah, yeah.

53:54.080 --> 53:56.440
-Is everything okay?
-Hm.

53:56.600 --> 53:58.280
I didn't know Sylvia
had friends in Italy.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.400
Oh, she has friends
all over the world.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.600
And enemies too probably.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.800
Bound to in her line of work.

54:04.960 --> 54:08.080
-Trade negotiations.
-Oh, darling.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.600
You don't believe
all that stuff about her

54:09.760 --> 54:13.000
being a boring
civil servant, do you?

54:13.160 --> 54:14.960
Sylvia's a spy.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.920
She's a spy.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.880
-She told you that?
-No, she didn't need to.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.240
Studied Arabic at Cambridge,

54:23.400 --> 54:25.480
conspicuously dull
diplomatic career,

54:25.640 --> 54:28.640
endless postings abroad,
what else could she be?

54:30.400 --> 54:32.280
My mother never guessed,
and I didn't let on.

54:32.440 --> 54:33.920
Why haven't you told me
this before?

54:34.080 --> 54:35.760
I can keep secrets too.

54:37.560 --> 54:38.800
Is that coffee ready?

54:38.960 --> 54:40.280
-Hm?
-Coffee.

54:40.440 --> 54:41.600
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

54:41.760 --> 54:44.560
Coffee, of course,
your secret coffee,

54:44.720 --> 54:47.360
secret cigarette
in your secret studio

54:47.520 --> 54:49.200
with your secret family.

55:19.680 --> 55:22.800
It's a long time ago,
in any case,

55:22.960 --> 55:25.120
students records are
confidential.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.440
Well, is there someone
who might remember?

55:29.120 --> 55:31.200
I don't have much
family left, so,

55:31.360 --> 55:32.880
it would really help
if I could find him.

55:33.040 --> 55:34.600
Sorry, signora.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.240
I can't recall Tommaso Rossi.

55:59.400 --> 56:02.360
Are you sure
he was a pupil here?

56:02.520 --> 56:06.840
Well, the man I'm looking for
seems to have treasured this.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.320
Um-hm.

56:12.280 --> 56:15.560
Many of the children
have no books of their own,

56:15.720 --> 56:17.560
they fall in love with one,

56:17.720 --> 56:20.120
and it's natural
they want to keep it.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.280
This is a picture of him.

56:28.160 --> 56:30.000
Does he look like
any of the boys

56:30.160 --> 56:31.480
that you taught 20 years ago?

56:33.400 --> 56:36.160
It's a type, you know.
I am sorry.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.720
Please, signora.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.320
What about this boy?

56:44.240 --> 56:46.360
The hair might not
be quite right.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.120
I can't help you, signora.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.520
Signora?

57:05.160 --> 57:07.160
He wasn't a pupil.

57:09.800 --> 57:13.880
He was the caretaker's boy.

57:15.920 --> 57:19.920
His name was...Luciano?

57:20.080 --> 57:22.480
Yes, Luciano Rinaldi.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.000
What do you remember about him?

57:27.160 --> 57:30.080
Not much, they left
when his father died.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.840
He was murdered.

57:37.480 --> 57:39.000
Goodbye, signora.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.120
Cast your net well
and the fish will come.

58:04.480 --> 58:06.040
Hello, Ercole.

58:09.120 --> 58:11.640
Ah...

58:14.760 --> 58:18.360
How's retirement?

58:18.520 --> 58:20.880
Fantastic.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.560
I'm fighting seagulls
rather than terrorists now.

58:24.720 --> 58:26.320
And it's a battle
I intend to win.

58:28.160 --> 58:32.240
You want to know
about Laura Boscolo?

58:33.640 --> 58:34.920
Did you find much?

58:36.960 --> 58:39.720
Boscolo moved to Perugia
a couple of years ago.

58:39.880 --> 58:43.120
Clean, as far as I can tell,
immaculate in fact.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.040
Hm.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.640
Which is interesting.

58:46.800 --> 58:49.800
'Cause her brother is
Richelmo Gregori.

58:49.960 --> 58:52.080
The boss who pretty much
runs this place.

58:53.760 --> 58:55.360
What are his specialties?

58:56.880 --> 59:01.240
Drugs, intimidation,
violence definitely.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.640
Murder almost certainly.

59:05.800 --> 59:09.200
But no one has ever been able to
lay a finger on him.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.400
Except once.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.680
When he was indicted for fraud.

59:16.640 --> 59:18.880
How long did he serve?

59:19.040 --> 59:24.360
Not a day. Another man took the
plane and went to jail instead.

59:26.640 --> 59:31.240
Was the man's name
Luciano Rinaldi by any chance?

59:37.280 --> 59:41.000
Sylvia, you are not
sanctioned here.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.280
And Gregori will go a long way

59:43.440 --> 59:48.400
to keep his sister's business
legit, dead or not.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.680
Turn around. Slowly.

1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:43.480
-Aah!
-Argh!

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.400
No, no, no, no.

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:47.080
Tommaso?

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.000
Wait!

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000
Tommaso?

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:14.360
You just missed him.

1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:17.240
I saw someone
watching the house.

1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:19.400
Thought it was
one of Gregori's men.

1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.720
Aren't you gonna ask
who's Gregori?

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:25.520
I know who Richelmo Gregori is,
Tommaso used to work for him.

1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:28.760
But he wasn't Tommaso then,
was he?

1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:31.760
He was Luciano Rinaldi.

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:34.120
Clever Aunty Sylvia.

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:36.000
We can talk about this now, or,

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:37.800
I can shout questions
through your door later

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:40.040
so your mother can hear?

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:42.840
When did Tommaso tell you
the truth about himself?

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.920
When he realized things were
getting serious between us.

1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:46.240
And you weren't concerned

1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:47.680
that he was living
under a false name?

1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:50.600
-It wasn't like that.
-What was it like?

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:53.480
Tommaso was just a boy
when his father died,

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:56.000
he said Gregori made him
stay on at school,

1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:58.880
helped him qualify
to be a notario, gave him work.

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:00.360
And then they wouldn't
let him go?

1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:06.120
And so you decided to take off
to South America without telling

1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:10.280
your mother even though you knew
it would break her heart?

1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:13.160
Don't lecture me,
I'm family, Sylvia.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.560
Where were you
when my grandma was dying?

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:25.280
You're not gonna believe this,

1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:27.480
but I didn't know
that she was ill.

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:31.960
Yeah, you're right.

1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:35.040
I don't believe you.

1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:41.360
What's it gonna take, Alice?

1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:43.840
Isn't a dead woman
in a lake enough?

1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:48.840
Aren't you coming?

1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:55.080
How was Rome?

1:02:56.680 --> 1:02:58.320
And your friend?

1:02:58.480 --> 1:02:59.760
Both good, thanks.

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:02.320
You didn't go to Rome, did you?

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:05.240
And there is no friend.

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:06.960
Work, I suppose.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:08.800
I should have guessed.

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.360
Probably the only reason
you came to the wedding.

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:12.560
Oh, that's not true.
For Christ's sake.

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:16.000
If you've found out anything
about Tommaso, tell me.

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:21.240
I'm Alice's mother,
I have a right to know.

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:26.880
Why didn't you tell me
when mum went in to hospital?

1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:28.280
You were on the other side
of the world.

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:30.160
That's why God
invented airplanes.

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:32.840
Oh.

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.600
Mum was so proud of you and your

1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:37.000
glittering career, she didn't
want to bother you.

1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:39.320
Well it bothers me that
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.120
You didn't tell me,
but you're still angry

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:42.760
with me that I wasn't there!

1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:44.480
No, I'm angry because--

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.360
I have to go to Perugia.

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:48.120
See another friend?

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:54.440
I heard about
Laura Boscolo,

1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:57.440
I wanted to offer
my condolences, I'm sorry.

1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:58.640
Yes.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:03.280
Will the restaurant survive?
Without her, I mean.

1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:04.800
I hope so.

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.240
Ah, the rest of the team are
at our training kitchen

1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:16.360
a few minutes away,
you want to see?

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:19.240
-Very much.
-My car is very near.

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:20.960
Mine is just outside.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.080
Did you and Laura set
up the restaurant together?

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:31.840
My father started it.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.120
Laura stepped in a few years ago
when we were losing money.

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:39.080
Turn here please.

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:41.840
Laura's money saved us.

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.120
This training program
was her idea.

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.840
How do you recruit the trainees?

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.360
We take the young
people nobody wants.

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:54.240
You can park through here.

1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:20.080
Gregori.

1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:21.440
No!

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:28.760
You're crazy.

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.440
He just wanted to talk.

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:36.520
There's nothing
in those pizza boxes.

1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:38.240
Was the restaurant
always a front?

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:41.200
No. I was in debt,

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:43.480
Laura put money
into the business,

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:47.120
she kept us going,
I was so grateful.

1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:49.240
But then you found out
the cost of her help.

1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:55.840
-It was only weed at first.
-Drugs?

1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:01.640
Now there's no point even
putting pizzas in the boxes.

1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:05.560
Get out.

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:07.840
We must be 20 kilometers away.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:10.520
Get out.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:45.880
It wasn't an accident, was it?

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.920
Someone who worked
with Boscolo asked to talk.

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:53.280
He said he wanted to help.

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:56.240
I was stupid enough
to believe him.

1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:57.560
He set you up?

1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:00.200
When I was driving back
from our meeting

1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:02.080
my brakes failed.

1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:04.240
The investigation said
it was an accident?

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:06.280
What investigation?

1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:08.800
-The police told me that--
-The police?

1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:10.960
People like them own the police.

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:18.080
The man you met,
the one who set you up,

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:19.480
was it Tommaso Rossi?

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:21.840
I told you, I've never heard of
Tommaso Rossi.

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.680
He called himself
Pietro.

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:29.000
Is this the man?

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:31.760
That's him.

1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:56.760
Do you think I'm stupid,
signora?Or corrupt?

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:01.320
I'm an Italian police officer
so I must be

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:03.560
one or the other, right?

1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:05.520
I know you're not stupid.

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:11.680
You know nothing of
how things work here.

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:13.920
Rossi worked for Boscolo,
presumably.

1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:17.880
It seems Rossi stole
from Boscolo, she found out,

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:20.720
and they killed her
and ran away.

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:23.400
For your family's sake,

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.040
you should really hope
he's very far away.

1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:24.480
Oh, darling, um,
do you want some coffee?

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:26.640
No time, I have to go to Perugia

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.960
to answer some more questions
from the carabineri.

1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:30.160
Oh, well, shall I come with you?

1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:31.920
No, it's fine. Thanks, mum.

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:43.640
She seems brighter,
don't you think?

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:45.280
Hm.

1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:50.840
I should get going too.

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:01.160
Alice!

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:03.400
Hey.

1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:15.640
Did you bring your passport?

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:19.360
The woman in the lake,
Laura Boscolo,

1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:21.000
did you kill her?

1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:23.240
I had no choice.

1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:26.640
-It was her or me.
-I don't understand.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:28.840
The train for Rome
leaves in ten minutes,

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.440
once we are on it you can ask me
any questions you like.

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:33.560
No, no, no, no, no. Now.

1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:36.080
Why was she there?
At your house?

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:39.160
Because she found out I was
going away, she came to stop me.

1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.920
Why? You're just a notario,
she could hire another one.

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.520
It's more complicated than that.

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.000
Laura is Gregori's sister.

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:54.320
-And I went to prison for him.
-Prison?

1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:57.920
That's why he let me
leave Civitavecchia.

1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:04.360
He owns me. He always will.
Unless I get far away from here.

1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:07.200
Nobody can own another person.

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.480
Not in your world maybe.

1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:10.960
In mine it happens all the time.

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:12.800
Alice, I love you,

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:19.000
you made me realize that I could
change and live a better life.

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:28.680
Then it will be okay. I promise.

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.600
You're so beautiful.

1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:49.440
I'll be right back, okay?

1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:20.200
-Don't do it, Alice.
-What are you doing here?

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.800
Trying to stop you throwing
your life away on a killer.

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.160
It was self-defense.

1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:26.080
He stabbed her to death
with a kitchen knife.

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.520
Where did you think
this money was coming from?

1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:33.160
For your new life
in South America?

1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:34.960
I don't know and neither do you.

1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:40.600
Did he tell you
about the journalist?

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:42.120
What journalist?

1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:44.240
Carla Galli was
investigating Laura Boscolo

1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:45.920
when they got to her,

1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:47.680
she was lucky she survived.

1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:49.840
She said she might
even walk again one day.

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.760
That's terrible. But it had
nothing to do with Tommaso.

1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:56.800
It has everything to do with
Tommaso. He set her up.

1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:59.640
Do you think
you can run forever?

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:02.160
They'll find him wherever
you go and they'll kill him.

1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:07.320
And they'll kill you too.
Don't do this.

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:11.440
He has to give himself up,
it's his only hope.

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.720
If you love him
you'll tell him--

1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:15.000
Just stay out of this, Sylvia.

1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:30.600
Okay? Ready? Ready?

1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:33.880
The money for South America,
did you steal it from her?

1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:34.920
-No.
-From Laura?

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:36.520
I earned it.

1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:38.560
I thought we'd be gone
before she found out.

1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:39.920
Why didn't you
just give it back?

1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:41.160
Because she'd have taken it

1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:42.280
and put a bullet in my head.

1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:43.920
That's why.

1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:45.520
Come on,
we don't have much time.

1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:48.800
But the journalist,
the journalist, Carla something.

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:51.520
-Good girl.
-Did you set her up?

1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:54.480
I met Galli to tell her
what I knew,

1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:58.280
Laura must have found out
and had me followed.

1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:00.360
They cut her brakes, not me.

1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:01.840
I don't think
I can do this, Tommaso.

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.080
Yes, we can.

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:04.480
No, you have to
give yourself up.

1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:06.200
It's the only way,
you must see that.

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:09.080
Please, I need you, please.

1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:22.080
Ask him how my sister found out

1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.080
about this little meeting
with Carla Galli.

1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:27.840
Go on, ask him.

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:38.240
She looked at his phone while he
was sleeping in bed beside her.

1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:49.440
You can go if you like, Luciano.
I won't try to stop you.

1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:53.800
I'll just kill
this young lady in your place.

1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:59.840
What? Good.

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:01.480
Here's what's going to happen.

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:22.880
Where are you?

1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:40.840
Shit.

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:24.440
Stop here.

1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:28.480
-Let her go.
-I will.

1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:31.480
When I've finished with you.

1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:34.440
Or maybe I won't,
you'll never know, will you?

1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:53.160
Take this.

1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:56.160
Tie him up, quickly.

1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:17.240
Get out of here
as fast as you can.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:18.840
Don't stop,
don't talk to anyone.

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:22.200
-Come on.
-Not him. Just you.

1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:24.880
No.

1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:29.560
Don't you understand?

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:34.480
It's true what he said.
Everything.

1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:37.960
Me and Laura, true.

1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:42.240
The money, that journalist,
everything.

1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:45.040
No. Please.

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:48.360
Go, Alice. Just go!

1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:02.720
You really do love her,
don't you?

1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:04.720
I had a life with her.

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:10.160
But it wasn't mine, was it?

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:11.640
The police will be here
any minute,

1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:13.600
you have no chance of escape.

1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:20.680
Gregori brought you here at
gunpoint, but you disarmed him,

1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:24.400
you could have killed him,
but you didn't.

1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:26.960
That should count for something.

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:30.440
Tell them everything you know
about Gregori and Boscolo.

1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:32.440
Don't tell them Alice was here.

1:20:34.520 --> 1:20:38.840
Why are you doing this for me?
Who are you?

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:42.120
Just an anxious aunt.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:22.600
Signora Volpe,
what a surprise.

1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:25.640
Take a look in the black SUV.

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:40.600
Sylvia?

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:50.800
CapitanoRivo was here.
You just missed him.

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.000
And?

1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:54.160
Tommaso's been arrested,
but, uh,

1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:57.840
Riva thinks he might be able to
claim self-defense.

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.680
I'm sorry to hear about Tommaso.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:02.400
But not surprised.

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:08.240
That's very good.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:11.320
Yeah. Maybe I'll actually
get to finish it now.

1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:18.760
I think that policeman,
capitano, likes you.

1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:20.080
-Riva?
-Hm.

1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:21.520
He can't stand me.

1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:22.960
For someone so perceptive

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:25.320
you can be very dense
at times, Sylv.

1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:30.280
-For you.
-Really?

1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:35.240
What is it? How did you know?

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:36.760
When I'm not being dense,

1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:38.880
sometimes I can be quite
perceptive.

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:45.400
It's been good to see you.
I wish I didn't have to leave.

1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:48.240
Oh. Well, why don't you
stay for a bit?

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:51.720
I mean, you've hardly seen
anything of the place yet.

1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:56.560
Of course not.

1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:00.760
Sylvia?

1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:04.640
Thank you.

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:06.200
Oh, my pleasure.

1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:08.360
I wasn't talking
about the perfume.

1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:20.880
You think I've been an idiot,
don't you?

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:24.240
I think you fell in love.

1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:35.000
When he first met me,
at the restaurant,

1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:36.920
he was there working
for Laura, wasn't he?

1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:39.800
He's been playing me
since the start.

1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:42.200
I don't think
he was playing you.

1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:45.800
I think he loved you as much as
he was capable of loving anyone.

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.760
Do you still love him?

1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:15.880
Hello?

1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:18.840
Don't you mean buonasera?

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.520
Well, I mean,
I tried to smooth things over,

1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:24.280
but Felicity seems determined
to put you in charge

1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:26.400
of liaison with
the Ministry of Defense .

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:29.640
Retribution.

1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:33.920
When are you coming back?

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:37.920
I miss you.

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:43.960
We've been missing each other
for a long time, Adam.

1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.320
Bye.
