really controlling the pace...

[continues indistinctly]

00:10.706 --> 00:12.708
[phone vibrating]

00:14.971 --> 00:17.974
ANNOUNCER: That's the thing
about these two fighters,

00:18.018 --> 00:20.411
they both have
excellent footwork.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.685
SAM:
Dad?

00:38.647 --> 00:40.823
What are you doing?

00:40.866 --> 00:42.912
You should be
asleep, pal.

00:42.955 --> 00:45.088
I hear noise.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.221
That's just the TV.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.223
All right? Now
close your eyes.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.268
I'm not tired.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.444
[knocking on door]

00:53.488 --> 00:56.752
All right. I got business.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.450
All right? You stay in this bed.
You hear me?

01:00.669 --> 01:03.193
I see you out of this bed,
you and me got big problems.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.542
Yes, sir.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.588
All right.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.509
[front door opens]

01:14.552 --> 01:16.337
MAN: What's happening, man?JOSEPH: Yo, what's good, man?

01:16.380 --> 01:17.773
What you need?MAN: Back up. Back up, man!

01:17.816 --> 01:19.296
I'll take it all.
Give me the roll!

01:19.340 --> 01:22.212
Just give me the cash!
Give me the roll!

01:22.256 --> 01:25.302
[overlapping chatter]

01:25.346 --> 01:26.912
[clattering]

01:26.956 --> 01:28.914

JOSEPH:
No, no. No!

01:30.568 --> 01:31.700

01:31.743 --> 01:34.137
[screams]

01:47.455 --> 01:49.021
[knocking on glass]

01:49.065 --> 01:50.284
Your 10:00 a.m. is here.

01:53.504 --> 01:54.984
Dr. Harper came
to see me yesterday.

01:55.027 --> 01:57.160
He has a rather
daunting legal problem,

01:57.204 --> 01:58.422
and I immediately thought

01:58.466 --> 02:01.425
we're gonna need some
more hands on deck.

02:01.469 --> 02:04.211
Well, before I sign on
for the big voyage,

02:04.254 --> 02:06.169
let's begin at
the beginning.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.084
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.651
I'm a pediatrician.

02:09.694 --> 02:13.045
I live in White Plains
just outside the city.

02:13.089 --> 02:16.875
I was in my offices here
in Midtown, seeing a patient,

02:16.919 --> 02:18.486
just after 11:00
yesterday morning,

02:18.529 --> 02:21.358
when the police showed up
to arrest me.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.751
What for?

02:22.794 --> 02:26.058
The execution-style murder

02:26.102 --> 02:28.452
of a heroin dealer in the Bronx.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.715
Okay.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.674
HARPER:
By the way,

02:32.717 --> 02:36.504
I don't believe that I have been
in the Bronx in over a decade.

02:36.547 --> 02:40.508
I have never ever
in my life done heroin.

02:40.551 --> 02:43.728
I'm not sure I'd know what it
was if it were in front of me.

02:43.772 --> 02:48.733
I've not fired a gun that shoots
anything bigger than a BB.

02:48.777 --> 02:52.694
And I was home
with my wife and two girls

02:52.737 --> 02:57.525
when this...
execution took place.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.528
Why do you think
they arrested you?

03:02.399 --> 03:06.273
DNA evidence was recovered from
under the victim's fingernails,

03:06.316 --> 03:08.362
the result of a struggle
with the killer.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.233
And?

03:10.277 --> 03:13.367
It appears to belong
to Dr. Harper.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.977
How close a match?

03:15.020 --> 03:18.633
100%.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.507
Not a lot of wiggle room there.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.423
Our new client,
Dr. Michael Harper,

03:26.467 --> 03:28.512
is out on $1 million bail
after having been arrested

03:28.556 --> 03:30.862
for the murder
of Joseph Lowell,

03:30.906 --> 03:33.474
a heroin dealer who was killed
in his apartment in the Bronx.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.606
[quietly]: We only represent
the best clients.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.391
MARISSA:
No sign of a break-in,

03:37.434 --> 03:40.481
which suggests the perpetrator
was a known acquaintance.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.526
Additionally, he had
just received a text

03:42.570 --> 03:45.877
from someone with an
untraceable burner phone.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.445
Joseph, the drug dealer,
was killed with his own gun,

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
which was later discovered
in the Hudson

03:50.317 --> 03:53.015
with no recoverable prints.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.017
So is Dr. Harper in fact

03:55.060 --> 03:57.454
a known acquaintance
of this Joseph Lowell?

03:57.498 --> 04:00.414
He claims to have
never heard his name

04:00.457 --> 04:03.721
before the police showed up
at his medical practice.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.549
Okay, so if he's innocent,

04:05.593 --> 04:08.291
then how did his DNA end up
on this dead drug dealer?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.162
At the moment,
no one can answer that question,

04:10.206 --> 04:11.816
but Bull thinks
it may have something to do

04:11.860 --> 04:14.297
with the way the police
made their DNA match.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.559
What do you mean?

04:15.603 --> 04:16.821
After the police found

04:16.865 --> 04:19.389
what they suspected
was the murderer's DNA

04:19.433 --> 04:21.565
under the victim's fingernails,
they ran the sample

04:21.609 --> 04:24.525
through their internal database,
and they came up dry.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.789
I'm confused. Then how
did they make the match?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.617
They didn't, but it turns out
that one of these

04:29.660 --> 04:32.489
big for-profit
genealogy companies did.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.665
Dr. Harper's wife had sent them

04:34.709 --> 04:37.059
some of her husband's DNA
as a birthday present.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.191
He's an only child,
both his parents

04:39.235 --> 04:41.716
had passed two years ago,
and he's got no sons.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.935
He started talking to her
about how he felt

04:43.979 --> 04:45.241
he didn't really know
where he came from,

04:45.285 --> 04:47.374
didn't really have
a handle on his roots.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.637
That he was likely
the last of his family,

04:49.680 --> 04:51.508
but he really had no idea
who his family was.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.554
It seemed like the perfect gift.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.990
Wait. You're talking
about one of those places

04:55.033 --> 04:56.600
you send a cheek swab into

04:56.644 --> 04:58.907
to find out what country
your relatives came from?

04:58.950 --> 05:00.691
TAYLOR: Is it
even legal for them

05:00.735 --> 05:03.259
to turn over your private
information like that?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.087
I'm betting they had
a search warrant.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.307
They sure did.
It was all on the up-and-up.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.526
Perfectly admissible in court.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.094
DNA? That's a,
that's a tough one.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.402
Did you know that 95% of jurors
are willing to convict

05:15.445 --> 05:17.447
based on DNA evidence alone?

05:17.491 --> 05:19.580
CHUNK: Okay, so
let's review.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.930
This man had no
relationship to the victim,

05:21.973 --> 05:25.237
had no criminal record,
no history of drug abuse,

05:25.281 --> 05:27.631
had no ties to the
crime whatsoever.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.286
And where did he say he was
the night of the killing?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.896
Home with his family.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.160
Well, then there must have been
a mistake, right?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.076
Now all we have to do
is prove it.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.469
CHUNK: Your posture should be relaxed.

05:39.513 --> 05:43.560
More than anything, we want
you to appear comfortable.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.693
You don't want to look
like you're trying too hard.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.695
The jury can almost
always sense it.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.392
Trying too hard to what?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.394
Save my husband's life?

05:51.438 --> 05:53.396
Look, I know
that this is difficult,

05:53.440 --> 05:55.398
but alibis from family members

05:55.442 --> 05:57.313
are the toughest
to get a jury to trust.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.141
You'd be surprised,
the things that people say

05:59.184 --> 06:00.751
to protect their spouses.

06:00.795 --> 06:04.189
We were home, with our kids,
watching television in bed.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.584
If I had known I would have
to prove this in a trial...

06:10.457 --> 06:13.068
I'm sorry.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.418
[sighs]

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
He's a pediatrician.

06:17.464 --> 06:21.119
He makes kids feel better
when they're sick.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.557
He comforts them
when they're scared.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.775
That's who he is.

06:24.819 --> 06:25.907
Well, there you go.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.952
That's what
the jury needs to know.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.259
That's what the jury
needs to understand.

06:30.302 --> 06:33.610
You know I'm the one who sent
his DNA to that company.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.830
Michael had nothing
to do with it.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.702
This... is my fault.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.748
Mrs. Harper, you...It was a couple years ago.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.315
I'd completely forgotten about
it until I got that e-mail.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.840
E-mail?

06:45.883 --> 06:48.582
What do you know about
the Fourth Amendment?

06:48.625 --> 06:51.585
Uh, unreasonable search
and seizure.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.587
It's one of
my favorites.

06:53.630 --> 06:57.504
Why? You got a pop quiz coming
up in constitutional law?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.114
Michael's wife is the one

06:59.157 --> 07:02.160
that sent his DNA sample
to that genealogy company.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.380
I know that.But did you know this?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.729
A few days before the arrest,

07:05.773 --> 07:07.470
she got an e-mail
from the company.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.820
It said they had received
a duplicate sample

07:09.864 --> 07:11.648
and that they wanted to know

07:11.692 --> 07:13.955
if it was from her
or another family member.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.218
She just told you that?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.741
I'm like a human can opener.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.526
People spend time with me,
and they can't help themselves.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.744
All right.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.964
So where are you going
with this?

07:23.007 --> 07:26.054
Well, we know the police were
at a dead end.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.230
They couldn't I.D. the DNA
from the crime scene

07:28.273 --> 07:30.058
using their databases.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.626
So they got a search warrant.
You heard Danny.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.497
But how did they get it?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.586
To get a search warrant,
you need probable cause.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.762
There's no way they could've
known that Michael's wife

07:38.806 --> 07:40.808
sent his DNA
into that genealogy company,

07:40.851 --> 07:43.245
or any genealogy company,
for that matter.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.986
I know it sounds
a little crazy,

07:45.029 --> 07:47.510
but what if, before they got
the search warrant,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.687
they sent a sample of this DNA
to the genealogy company--

07:50.731 --> 07:53.864
every genealogy company--
posing as a customer,

07:53.908 --> 07:55.866
all as part of
an elaborate ruse

07:55.910 --> 07:57.520
to get one of these
companies to verify

07:57.564 --> 07:59.783
they had a match
in their system?

07:59.827 --> 08:01.350
That way, they can go
to a judge, and say,

08:01.393 --> 08:03.874
"We need a warrant
for this particular company."

08:03.918 --> 08:05.833
Pretty good.

08:05.876 --> 08:08.270
The website would've flagged it
as a duplicate match,

08:08.313 --> 08:10.664
alerted the
original customer...

08:10.707 --> 08:13.275
And confirmed to the cops
that the killer's DNA

08:13.318 --> 08:15.320
was in their system,
without even realizing it.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.887
Right.TAYLOR:
So you're thinking

08:16.931 --> 08:18.759
if we take this to a judge,
he or she might rule

08:18.802 --> 08:20.848
all this DNA evidence
collected inadmissible?

08:22.371 --> 08:23.459
It's worth a shot.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.547
Your Honor,

08:24.591 --> 08:26.331
this e-mail was sent

08:26.375 --> 08:28.682
to Mrs. Harper five days
prior to Michael's arrest,

08:28.725 --> 08:30.771
and three days prior
to the application

08:30.814 --> 08:31.989
for a search warrant.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.251
It's clearly a Fourth
Amendment violation.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.777
Uh, exactly how so?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.779
Well, the police
contacted the website

08:38.822 --> 08:40.781
under an assumed identity,

08:40.824 --> 08:43.000
effectively tricking
them into participating

08:43.044 --> 08:44.480
in a law enforcement
investigation

08:44.524 --> 08:45.699
without their knowledge.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.744
And the A.D.A. here
signed off on it.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.791
Your Honor, using a ruse,
lying to a suspect

08:50.834 --> 08:53.184
to elicit information
relevant to a criminal case

08:53.228 --> 08:55.796
is absolutely legal here
in the state of New York.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.754
You didn't lie to a suspect, you
lied to a public corporation.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.930
It has no effect on the
legitimacy of the evidence.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.150
Doesn't say a whole hell
of a lot about the integrity

09:02.193 --> 09:03.412
of the D.A.'s office.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.805
Kind of hard not
to wonder what other rules

09:04.848 --> 09:06.023
you'd be willing to break.

09:06.067 --> 09:06.937
Enough.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.722
Judge Volk, the defense requests

09:08.765 --> 09:11.725
that the court suppress all
evidence relating to this DNA

09:11.768 --> 09:13.814
since it was obtained
through what amounts to

09:13.857 --> 09:15.772
an illegal search and seizure.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.818
Your Honor, you mustn't
suppress that evidence.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.471
T-The government's
entire case...

09:19.515 --> 09:21.909
Exactly! The government's
entire case is built on fruit

09:21.952 --> 09:26.609
from a poisonous tree, and you
must, therefore, suppress it.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.655
The discovery's troubling.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.788
But if the defense takes it up
with anyone,

09:31.832 --> 09:33.921
they should take it up
with the genealogy site.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.923
Not the police.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.665
They were just
doing their job,

09:38.708 --> 09:40.144
trying to find
a cold-blooded killer

09:40.188 --> 09:42.712
who orphaned a little boy.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.192
[exhales]

09:44.235 --> 09:46.194
Are you aware that boy's mother
died when he was a baby?

09:46.237 --> 09:49.023
That man,
whatever his troubles,

09:49.066 --> 09:51.939
was all the boy
had in the world.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.941
Now he's in the system.

09:53.984 --> 09:58.815
Where, in all likelihood,
he'll remain until he turns 18.

09:58.859 --> 10:02.950
Someone has to be held
responsible for that.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.824
The DNA match stands
as evidence.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.523
This trial
will continue.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.569
♪

10:22.230 --> 10:26.234
Anybody here ever heard
of the Phantom of Heilbronn?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.539
Female serial killer,

10:27.583 --> 10:29.716
terrorized France,
Germany, Austria,

10:29.759 --> 10:31.369
from 1993 to 2009?

10:33.110 --> 10:36.418
DNA evidence linked her
to over 40 crimes,

10:36.461 --> 10:39.856
including six murders.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.685
And when I say "linked her,"
I mean figuratively,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.513
because even though
they had all this DNA,

10:44.556 --> 10:45.949
they had no idea who she was.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.996
Three different countries.

10:49.039 --> 10:52.521
No apparent links at all
between the victims.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.044
Made no sense.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.046
I sense a punch line coming.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.570
Well, the police
finally tracked that DNA

10:58.614 --> 11:00.442
to a sweet old woman in Latvia

11:00.485 --> 11:04.141
who was working in a factory,
manufacturing cotton swabs.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.404
I'm guessing
the same cotton swabs

11:06.448 --> 11:09.886
used to gather the DNA evidence
from the crime scenes.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.149
What happened?

11:12.193 --> 11:15.152
She must have contaminated them
with her own DNA.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.850
Validate that man's parking.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.635
All right, until we find
our own little Latvian woman

11:19.679 --> 11:22.594
working in a Q-tip factory,
we need to find jurors whose

11:22.638 --> 11:24.553
psychological makeup

11:24.596 --> 11:26.381
will allow
them to look

11:26.424 --> 11:29.384
past what seems to be
incontrovertible evidence.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.429
How in the world
do you do that?

11:31.473 --> 11:34.389
We look for jurors
who rely on an affect heuristic

11:34.432 --> 11:35.607
when it comes
to decision-making.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.436
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.092
A heuristic is a kind
of mental shortcut

11:42.136 --> 11:44.181
we all use to make decisions
throughout the day,

11:44.225 --> 11:46.575
and when those decisions are
allowed to be colored

11:46.618 --> 11:48.708
by our mood or our feelings

11:48.751 --> 11:50.492
in the moment
we make the decision,

11:50.535 --> 11:52.102
that is called
an affect heuristic.

11:52.146 --> 11:55.627
Essentially, we want jurors
who go with their gut.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.281
Why?

11:57.325 --> 11:59.109
Because the one thing there's no
denying is that when you first

11:59.153 --> 12:00.894
meet our client,
"killer" is not the word

12:00.937 --> 12:02.243
that pops into your head.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.810
Yeah, the guy's likable.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.463
You trust him.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.509
Not withstanding
the charges against him,

12:07.552 --> 12:09.511
he strikes you as a good man.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.469
Yeah.And the thing
about jurors is,

12:11.513 --> 12:13.602
if their first impression
is positive, they are gonna

12:13.645 --> 12:15.473
struggle with the idea

12:15.517 --> 12:17.649
that they need
to modify that impression.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.348
And the seemingly irrefutable
DNA evidence

12:20.391 --> 12:23.003
will have less impact.LINDSEY:
And what do I need

12:23.046 --> 12:26.441
to ask them to figure out if
they have this, um, this...?

12:26.484 --> 12:28.617
Affect heuristic?Yes.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.620
You don't have
to ask them anything.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.796
You just have to open your eyes.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.930
BULL: Older woman in the
gray sweater is looking

12:36.973 --> 12:39.367
at Michael like he's her
grandson. We want her.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.326
But we haven't even
talked to her yet.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.807
Words lie,
body language doesn't.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
She likes him.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.810
But at the end of the day,

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
it can't just be
about an affect heuristic.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.597
That might net us one
or two friends on the jury,

12:52.641 --> 12:54.817
but we're gonna need
to broaden our search.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.124
Target jurors
with pessimism bias, as well.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.865
BENNY:
People who tend to exaggerate

12:58.908 --> 13:00.475
the likelihood
that negative things

13:00.518 --> 13:01.781
are going to happen to them.

13:01.824 --> 13:05.523
Why would I want these people
on my jury?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.090
Because our narrative is that

13:07.134 --> 13:10.093
Michael is an innocent man,
wrongly accused.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.574
I believe
jurors with pessimism bias

13:12.617 --> 13:14.968
will put themselves
in Michael's shoes.

13:15.011 --> 13:18.449
And the fear of something
like this happening to them--

13:18.493 --> 13:21.931
it will likely dilute
the importance of the evidence.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.194
LINDSEY:
Good morning.Good morning.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.587
Do you like to travel?

13:25.630 --> 13:27.154
I honestly couldn't say.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.546
I haven't done much of it.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.331
Any particular reason?

13:30.374 --> 13:33.073
I guess maybe
I just feel safer at home.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.944
LINDSEY:
Safer how?

13:34.988 --> 13:37.729
Can't get in a plane crash
if you don't get on a plane.

13:37.773 --> 13:38.861
Can't have terrorists
take over your hotel

13:38.905 --> 13:40.254
if you don't go
to the hotel

13:40.297 --> 13:41.603
in the first place.

13:45.563 --> 13:48.436
This juror is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.830
Acceptable to the prosecution.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.570
Fantastic.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.312
We have ourselves a jury.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.574
We'll see all of you here

13:56.618 --> 13:59.447
bright and early tomorrow
to start trial.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.493
So we've got four out
of 12 jurors that are at least

14:02.537 --> 14:04.756
inclined
to look past the evidence.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.932
I'll take it.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.672
All I need is one
to get a mistrial.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.110
BENNY:
Talk about being happy

14:10.153 --> 14:12.373
in your work...

14:13.678 --> 14:16.377
Yeah. Wonder what that's about.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.597
Everything all right?

14:19.641 --> 14:20.729
Dr. Harper?

14:22.644 --> 14:25.734
What does the D.A.'s office know
that we don't?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.170
What do you mean?

14:27.214 --> 14:28.824
What kind of question is that?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.173
Look, I get it.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.045
The D.A.'s office has DNA

14:32.088 --> 14:34.525
that would seem
to prove you did this,

14:34.569 --> 14:36.397
and supposedly
that's all they have,

14:36.440 --> 14:38.094
but common sense would suggest

14:38.138 --> 14:40.357
that in the absence
of any other link

14:40.401 --> 14:41.793
to this crime, at least

14:41.837 --> 14:44.318
one juror is gonna
take exception to the idea

14:44.361 --> 14:46.102
of putting you behind bars
for the rest of your life.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.800
But the A.D.A. is not
acting that way.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.455
In fact, he's acting
like he has you dead to rights,

14:51.499 --> 14:53.631
and I would like to know why.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.852
Well, I can't help you
with that.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.463
You never met the victim?Never.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.770
Never purchased illegal drugs?Never.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.554
Never consumed heroin?
Never tried to buy heroin?

15:03.598 --> 15:05.687
You never contemplated
trying to buy heroin?

15:05.730 --> 15:06.688
Of course not!

15:06.731 --> 15:08.820
Then why is the A.D.A.
so damn sure

15:08.864 --> 15:11.388
he can draw a line
between you and the victim?

15:11.432 --> 15:13.695
Or is it between you and heroin?

15:13.738 --> 15:15.653
Just trust me,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.264
whatever it is,
they're gonna find it.

15:17.307 --> 15:19.396
[sighs]

15:19.440 --> 15:21.616
And if I'm gonna
keep you out of prison,

15:21.659 --> 15:24.097
I need to know about it.

15:26.664 --> 15:29.841
Can we go somewhere
a little more private?

15:29.885 --> 15:33.628
HARPER:
Couple of years ago, I broke
my ankle playing basketball.

15:33.671 --> 15:37.937
Emergency room doctor
prescribed oxycodone.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.852
I took it.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.681
I kept taking it,
even after my ankle healed.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.469
And I'd never done drugs before.

15:48.512 --> 15:52.255
I mean, never so much
as smoked pot in college.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.737
It was so serene being high.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.261
So tranquil.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.002
Mm.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.526
I never experienced that before.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.833
You ever write your
own prescription?

16:04.876 --> 16:06.182
A doctor writing
his own prescription

16:06.226 --> 16:07.792
for a controlled substance--

16:07.836 --> 16:10.708
the AMA would not
look kindly on that.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.145
No. Never.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.495
The prescriptions were
all legitimate.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.845
All from other doctors.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.631
Of course,
my wife figured it out.

16:21.850 --> 16:25.071
Mm, she knew
something was going on.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.855
She threw away the pills

16:26.898 --> 16:29.989
and threatened to leave
with the kids if I didn't quit.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.253
Did you go to rehab?

16:33.296 --> 16:34.950
No, I did it myself.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.084
It was rough, but...
I was lucky.

16:38.127 --> 16:41.043
I was able to do it on my own.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.394
My wife's the only one
who knows.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.222
I wouldn't count on that.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.050
I'm sure the A.D.A.
has already gone

16:48.094 --> 16:50.748
through your prescription
records, and once

16:50.792 --> 16:52.707
he sees multiples on the oxy,
he is gonna make the case

16:52.750 --> 16:56.058
that you got tired of having to
beg your doctors to supply you

16:56.102 --> 16:59.540
with drugs and switched
to heroin, which is what happens

16:59.583 --> 17:02.978
more often than not
when people get hooked on oxy.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.329
But... that would be a lie.

17:06.373 --> 17:10.899
Look, I swear to you,
I have never done heroin,

17:10.942 --> 17:14.903
and I've never heard
of this man.

17:16.905 --> 17:20.387
I did not,
I could not kill that man.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.432
[clicks tongue]

17:22.476 --> 17:24.478
Okay.

17:24.521 --> 17:28.351
Then we're not putting the wife
on the stand.

17:28.395 --> 17:29.831
Jody? She's his alibi.

17:29.874 --> 17:32.834
Well, no. She is also the
only one who knows that he had

17:32.877 --> 17:35.097
an addiction
to opioid painkillers,

17:35.141 --> 17:38.970
the most common gateway drug
to heroin, which is what

17:39.014 --> 17:40.537
the murder victim was selling.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.670
But what if
the A.D.A. calls her?

17:42.713 --> 17:45.934
Well, then we'll just have
to claim spousal privilege.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.850
I mean,
she's married to the accused.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.895
They can't compel her
to take the stand.

17:50.939 --> 17:55.204
I don't like it,
but what choice do we have?

17:56.249 --> 17:58.816
Morning.
Get your scorecards.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.993
You can't tell the players
without a scorecard.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.433
What's going on?

18:06.476 --> 18:08.522
He's springing
a new witness on us.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.742
I don't know who he is
or how he ties in to all this.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.831
Do you know a Dr. David Parsons?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.053
He's my neighbor.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.011
Just your neighbor?

18:20.055 --> 18:22.536
Well, he's a doctor.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.669
Your oxy connection, right?

18:32.981 --> 18:35.114
COLLINS:
Dr. Parsons, how do you
know Dr. Michael Harper?

18:35.157 --> 18:38.160
We've been neighbors and friends
for the past seven years.

18:38.204 --> 18:42.382
Around the same age,
both in the same profession.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.515
And have you ever treated
Dr. Harper as a patient?

18:45.559 --> 18:48.083
Depends on how
you define "patient."

18:48.127 --> 18:50.041
He is a friend.

18:50.085 --> 18:53.132
And I did help him
with some follow-up

18:53.175 --> 18:55.699
after he broke his ankle
a few years ago.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.006
What kind of follow-up?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.183
Pain management.

19:01.227 --> 19:05.448
This was a few months
after he broke it.

19:05.492 --> 19:09.017
He told me
the ankle was still acting up.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.759
And so you wrote him
a prescription for oxycodone?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.369
An opiate?

19:13.413 --> 19:14.762
I did.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.633
Did you believe he was in pain?

19:16.677 --> 19:18.418
Most definitely.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.072
Most definitely?

19:21.116 --> 19:23.292
The truth is,
you had no way

19:23.336 --> 19:25.468
of really knowing,
did you, Dr. Parsons?

19:29.733 --> 19:32.301
Did you?

19:32.345 --> 19:34.651
The witness will please
answer the question.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.742
I depended largely

19:38.786 --> 19:42.659
on Dr. Harper's
anecdotal impressions,

19:42.703 --> 19:45.096
but that's true
with many patients.

19:45.140 --> 19:48.535
But again, it had been
three months since the accident.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.450
Yeah, that's true,
but it is not unusual for...

19:50.493 --> 19:52.103
In fact, you didn't write
him one prescription.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.366
You wrote him
three, didn't you?

19:53.409 --> 19:55.106
Over a period
of about six weeks.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.197
And was that it, or
did he ask for another?

20:02.723 --> 20:05.943
I'd like to remind you
you are under oath, Dr. Parsons.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.731
Yes, he did.

20:10.774 --> 20:14.213
But you said "no"?

20:20.784 --> 20:22.351

that you no longer thought

20:22.395 --> 20:24.179
he was most definitely in pain?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.833
You could assume that.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.443
And isn't it
true that when

20:27.487 --> 20:29.924
an addict can no longer get
a prescription for oxycodone,

20:29.967 --> 20:32.274
it's common for them
to turn to street drugs?

20:32.318 --> 20:35.321
Most often heroin, which is
exactly what Joseph Lowell sold?

20:38.280 --> 20:41.283
Dr. Parsons is not an addiction
expert, nor is he a mind reader.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.068
Your Honor,
David Parsons is a doctor,

20:44.112 --> 20:45.896

intimately familiar

20:45.940 --> 20:48.116
with the world
of opioid painkillers.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.160

Dr. Parsons,

20:50.945 --> 20:54.296
doesn't oxycodone addiction
commonly lead

20:54.340 --> 20:55.819
to heroin addiction?

21:01.390 --> 21:03.262
[sighs]

21:03.305 --> 21:06.090
Yes.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.658

abused a prescription drug,

that doesn't make
them a killer.

Dr. Bull,

22:10.024 --> 22:11.721
you know, ever since
you told us that story

22:11.765 --> 22:14.376
about the, uh, the old lady
with the cotton swabs,

22:14.420 --> 22:18.293
I've been researching false
positives as they relate to DNA.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.034
And while there
aren't a lot of them,

22:20.077 --> 22:23.167
there was a case in California,
uh, just a few years ago.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.865
Let's see.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.650
Guy was arrested for murder
based solely on DNA evidence,

22:27.694 --> 22:29.086
just like Dr. Harper,

22:29.130 --> 22:31.219
and he swore up and down
he was innocent.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.960
And it turns out, he was.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.397
They figured out
his DNA ended up on the victim

22:35.441 --> 22:37.399
because of something called
"DNA migration."

22:37.443 --> 22:39.358
Never heard of it. You?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.924
No.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.274
It's the secondary
transfer of DNA.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.625
And it happens because
the average person sheds

22:45.668 --> 22:48.628
somewhere between 40
and 50 million skin cells a day.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.761

Also, they don't stay put.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.425
Those cells, that DNA--
just end up on the next person

23:03.469 --> 23:05.384
who touches the creamer jug.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.342
Sounds like
you may have found a way

23:07.386 --> 23:09.388
to un-dot some "I"s
and uncross some "T"s.

So you're saying

You think that'll be enough?

23:25.273 --> 23:29.408
No. We'll need something
concrete, some kind of proof

23:29.451 --> 23:32.759

the murder victim were both in

23:32.802 --> 23:34.587

any way you could try

23:36.153 --> 23:38.808
and retrace the steps
of both men that day,

23:38.852 --> 23:42.464

of intersection,

23:42.508 --> 23:44.423
hopefully a mutual point
of contact?

23:44.466 --> 23:48.122
With a little luck...

23:48.165 --> 23:51.430
Is that something you might be
available to do tonight?

we know that after he dropped
his son off at school,

the day of his death,
he came into Manhattan

people sit in that chair

26:49.695 --> 26:51.740

31:12.174 --> 31:16.091
I'm a man of science. I know
that what they are asserting...

31:16.135 --> 31:18.267
is absolute.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.400
It's unimpeachable.

31:21.531 --> 31:26.232
The only problem
is I'm me,

31:26.275 --> 31:30.410
24 hours a day.

31:30.453 --> 31:33.369
I was not there,
I did not do it,

31:33.413 --> 31:35.632
and I know that with
just as much certainty

31:35.676 --> 31:39.419
as the science is
screaming that I must have.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.378
[Jody sniffles]

31:42.422 --> 31:44.728
If only I didn't
send that sample.

31:44.772 --> 31:47.166
No. Mm-mm.I'm sorry.

31:50.734 --> 31:53.389
It was such a
thoughtful thing.

31:56.479 --> 32:00.005
My parents,

32:00.048 --> 32:04.357
they never liked to
talk about the past.[sniffles]

32:04.400 --> 32:06.620
Whenever I'd ask them
where we came from,

32:06.663 --> 32:09.014
they'd just throw their
hands up in the air

32:09.057 --> 32:11.277
and say we were
Americans.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.759
To finally read about...

32:15.803 --> 32:17.413
my family's history,

32:17.457 --> 32:20.851
the bad parts,
the slave ships...[sniffles]

32:20.895 --> 32:23.419
...the good parts.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.988
That my ancestors fought

32:27.032 --> 32:30.209
side by side with
the colonists to...

32:30.252 --> 32:34.343
secure this freedom for
this country from Britain.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.389
[sniffles]

32:38.521 --> 32:41.524
I'm the last of the line.

32:43.526 --> 32:46.486
And my legacy is...

32:46.529 --> 32:49.445
I killed a man.

32:52.144 --> 32:55.886
Not that I've helped hundreds
of kids get through...

32:55.930 --> 32:59.020
infancy and adolescence

32:59.064 --> 33:01.849
in good health.

33:04.156 --> 33:07.724
Not that I married
this amazing woman.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.335
[sniffles]

33:09.378 --> 33:14.296
And helped bring two phenomenal
girls into this world.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.734
Just...

33:17.778 --> 33:19.910
[sniffles]

33:19.954 --> 33:22.783
...I killed a man.

33:24.524 --> 33:27.222
A man I never met.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.711
I promised the A.D.A. that...

33:37.754 --> 33:41.106
we'd let him know
within 24 hours.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.093
Definitely makes me
an early bird.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.052
Question is,
does that make you two worms?

34:14.095 --> 34:16.706
I couldn't sleep.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.056
I called Taylor.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.666
Luckily, I was alone.

34:19.709 --> 34:22.582
And she agreed to come in here
and help me with something.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.019
Get back to the part where
you said you couldn't sleep.

34:25.063 --> 34:29.023
I just couldn't stop thinking
about poor Dr. Harper.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.199
You were not alone
in that. [sighs]

34:31.243 --> 34:33.984
Something in the way he said
his parents never wanted to talk

34:34.028 --> 34:36.726
about the past, how it
seemed like he's spent...

34:36.770 --> 34:38.989
his whole life feeling...

34:39.033 --> 34:40.817
disconnected.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.168
I'm not unfamiliar
with that feeling.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.822
You're talking about...

34:45.866 --> 34:47.911
being adopted.

34:47.955 --> 34:50.914
[exhales] Dr. Harper
wasn't adopted.

34:50.958 --> 34:53.482
I don't understand
how any of this applies.

34:54.527 --> 34:57.095
Found this 45 minutes ago.

34:58.922 --> 35:01.229
BULL:
What am I looking at?

35:01.273 --> 35:02.665
His mother's
medical records.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.537
The woman he believes
is his mother.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.192
Elinor Harper had
a hysterectomy at 23.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.454
Uterine fibroids.

35:08.497 --> 35:11.457
Dr. Harper came into her life
when she was 28.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.154
She can't be his
biological mother.

35:13.198 --> 35:14.112
It's not possible.

35:17.376 --> 35:20.118
So, why am I looking
at this birth certificate?

35:20.161 --> 35:21.249
I mean, who is this?

35:21.293 --> 35:23.599
Who is... Jackson McKay?

35:24.644 --> 35:26.820
You are, Dr. Harper.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.388
Jackson McKay
was your name

35:29.431 --> 35:31.346
for the first 14 months
of your life,

35:31.390 --> 35:33.609
right up until your parents,
the Harpers,

35:33.653 --> 35:35.263
adopted you.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.091
Adopted?

35:37.135 --> 35:39.093
I'm not adopted.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.225
I know it's got
to come as a shock,

35:40.268 --> 35:42.662
but I have a folder full
of records here

35:42.705 --> 35:45.099
that proves you are.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.362
I'm sorry, why are you
telling us this now?

35:47.406 --> 35:49.973
This is why.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.280
What's this now?

35:52.324 --> 35:55.196
Your brother's
birth certificate.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.764
Your twin brother.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.420
Oh, my God.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.509
The only other person
on the planet

36:03.552 --> 36:07.382
who has exactly the same DNA
that you do.

36:07.426 --> 36:10.646
100% match.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.171
LINDSEY: Can you identify
the man in this photo?

36:14.215 --> 36:16.174
That's Brandon McKay.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.263
[gallery murmuring]

36:18.306 --> 36:20.265
LINDSEY:
And how do you know Mr. McKay?

36:20.308 --> 36:22.223
He's what we would call a client

36:22.267 --> 36:25.792
at the city shelter
on 156th Street where I work.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.272
Like a lot
of our clients,

36:27.315 --> 36:29.665
he would come in when it got
too cold to be on the street.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.014
Objection, Your Honor.

36:31.058 --> 36:33.016
What exactly is the point
of this witness?

36:33.060 --> 36:34.757
I have no idea, Counselor.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.238
But I assure you,
I'm fascinated.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.240
Objection overruled.

36:39.284 --> 36:42.983
You are a social worker
and addiction counselor.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.464
Can you talk about some
of the underlying conditions

36:45.507 --> 36:46.900
that you believe contributed

36:46.943 --> 36:49.294
to Mr. McKay's
chronic homelessness?

36:49.337 --> 36:50.730
Like a lot of our clients,

36:50.773 --> 36:53.167
Mr. McKay struggled
with an addiction to heroin.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.169
And he had a violent streak.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.910
I remember he got
into a fistfight with one

36:56.953 --> 36:58.999
of the other residents
two Christmases ago.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.610
Do you happen to have
his shelter records with you?

37:01.654 --> 37:04.439
I do.And do your records
happen to indicate

37:04.483 --> 37:06.311
Mr. McKay's birth date?

37:07.355 --> 37:10.271
March 2, 1975.

37:10.315 --> 37:14.232
The exact same birth
date as Dr. Harper.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.799
[gallery murmuring]

37:16.843 --> 37:18.192
Give me a sense.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.194
It's starting to look
less like a stoplight

37:20.238 --> 37:22.240
and more like a
Christmas tree in here.

37:24.633 --> 37:28.420
So, what did Brandon McKay
have that my client didn't?

37:28.463 --> 37:30.857
For one, motive.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.512
He was in dire need
of heroin and money.

37:33.555 --> 37:36.341
By robbing the victim's supply,
he could get both.

37:36.384 --> 37:39.387
Second,
opportunity.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.389
He was a known associate
of the victim,

37:41.433 --> 37:45.306
someone Joseph would've let into
his home no questions asked.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.570
And was Dr. Harper identified
by the victim's son?

37:48.614 --> 37:49.919
Of course.

37:49.963 --> 37:53.096
Because he looks exactly like
the murderer.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.185
He's his twin brother.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.927
But the most
important thing

37:57.971 --> 38:01.322
is the one thing
these two men shared.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.411
Their DNA.

38:03.455 --> 38:08.024
Identical twins' DNA
is identical.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.940
A 100% match.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.421
Which means
there is no way to tell

38:13.465 --> 38:16.859
which one of the brothers
committed this crime,

38:16.903 --> 38:19.601
even if, in your hearts,

38:19.645 --> 38:23.083
I think you already know.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.263
Very well then. That concludes
the closing arguments.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.048
And in anticipation
of the jury beginning

38:32.092 --> 38:33.049
their deliberations...

38:33.093 --> 38:34.355
Your Honor,

38:34.399 --> 38:36.879
I apologize for the,
uh, interruption.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.447
But before we ask
the jury to deliberate

38:39.491 --> 38:42.189
upon the evidence
and the testimony,

38:42.232 --> 38:44.409
I was hoping to request
a short recess

38:44.452 --> 38:47.020
so that I might confer
with opposing counsel

38:47.063 --> 38:51.546
and save the court and the jury
some time and...

38:51.590 --> 38:52.547
trouble.

in my chambers.

that means?

39:02.252 --> 39:03.819
Only good things.

39:06.474 --> 39:09.085
[quietly]: Do you
want some company?

39:09.129 --> 39:10.696
Sure.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.700
So,

39:14.743 --> 39:17.703
when he says they're
dropping all the charges...

39:17.746 --> 39:19.357
It means you're free.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.663
It means it's over. They realize
they made a mistake.

39:21.707 --> 39:22.882
BENNY:
A mistake you might

39:22.925 --> 39:24.449
actually want
to sue them for.Mm.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.365
But that's a conversation
we can have another time.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.759
So, now what happens
to my brother?

39:30.803 --> 39:32.587
Will there be
another trial?

39:32.631 --> 39:34.415
Well, if there were,

39:34.459 --> 39:36.678
the same way his DNA
gave us reasonable doubt,

39:36.722 --> 39:38.376
yours would do the same for him.

39:38.419 --> 39:41.379
There's no way, definitively,

39:41.422 --> 39:43.163
to prove which one
of you did it.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.426
So they won't prosecute?

39:45.470 --> 39:46.993
They can't.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.561
Dr. Harper,
the second we found out

39:49.604 --> 39:51.214
that you had
an identical twin,

39:51.258 --> 39:54.217
I had my team out
in the field looking for him.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.784
And we found him.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.179
I'm sorry.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.007
Uh...

40:01.050 --> 40:04.489
he's been in the Philadelphia
City Morgue for three days

40:04.532 --> 40:07.579
as a result of an overdose.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.364
Michael, he was a junkie.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.757

40:11.800 --> 40:14.455
But he looked
just like me.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.805
You're not the same.

40:16.849 --> 40:19.112
I know, but...

40:19.155 --> 40:22.681
still, I looked
him up on-online.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.510
We both played basketball
in high school.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.949
We both struggled
with addiction.

40:29.992 --> 40:33.474

when I was young.

turned out one way

40:38.087 --> 40:40.438

put me through school

me with my sobriety.

by piece, choice by choice.
