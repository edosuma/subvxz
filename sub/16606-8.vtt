00:14.765 --> 00:17.725
Lawrence, it's me.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.437
I know you hate me right now.

00:20.656 --> 00:22.789
I hate me, too.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.192
But three days?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.740
Can we just talk?

00:32.783 --> 00:36.401
I'll do whatever it
takes. Just come home.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.872
I'm sorry.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.323
I miss you.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.120
Please call me back.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.534
I love you.

01:16.202 --> 01:18.582
Yeah, Craig. So, if you could get
that started, that would be great.

01:18.621 --> 01:20.619
After that, Lawrence, start
getting the project team

01:20.644 --> 01:22.464
looking at the public API documentation.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.830
Yeah, actually, that's what I'm
gonna show you by the end of the day.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.877
You know, I was thinking we could
replicate some of the things...

01:26.921 --> 01:29.675
Excuse me. Lawrence,
there's a delivery for you.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.838
Uh, excuse me, guys.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.784
So, what Lawrence was saying,

01:34.809 --> 01:36.534
at the verification three-step process,

01:36.559 --> 01:39.847
I was thinking that we could access
the multiple accounts with a single...

01:43.355 --> 01:45.687
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

01:45.731 --> 01:47.691
I thought you might need some things

01:47.733 --> 01:49.917
while you're staying at Chad's.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.236
Uh, I brought you some toothpaste,

01:53.280 --> 01:54.863
some shaving cream,

01:54.888 --> 01:56.758
some panties.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.293
I'm just kidding. I
didn't get you panties.

02:03.421 --> 02:05.371
I was in a meeting, Issa.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.167
I'm sorry.

02:09.642 --> 02:11.605
I just needed to see you.

02:14.593 --> 02:18.855
- I... I made a mistake.
- Yeah, you fucking did.

02:20.461 --> 02:22.737
I... I still want us to work.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.096
Lawrence, just... just
give me a chance to fix this

02:27.147 --> 02:29.437
and I will...

02:29.483 --> 02:31.308
I'm in this.

02:32.528 --> 02:36.068
I... I love you.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.985
I gotta go.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.118
And stop fucking calling me.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.503
I'm done.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.611
I called the company, like, four times

03:05.636 --> 03:08.119
and we still haven't gotten
our deposit back on our chairs.

03:09.674 --> 03:12.275
I'm starting to think we
shouldn't have let people sit down.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.400
Mm-hmm.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.067
I just finished up my
donor thank-you calls.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.866
- How about you?
- Almost.

03:22.861 --> 03:25.501
Well, don't forget to call
yourself and say thank you.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.740
I know I will.

03:48.594 --> 03:50.858
Can't wait for you to get off.

03:53.361 --> 03:54.691
Hello?

03:54.716 --> 03:56.846
Bitch, you still mad?

03:58.781 --> 04:00.701
Hello? Can you... can you hear me?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.731
Yes, I heard you. What do you want?

04:03.756 --> 04:07.039
Oh, I was just calling to say hi

04:07.081 --> 04:10.001
and to thank you for your donation.

04:10.042 --> 04:13.422
Um, and I'm supposed to let you know
that your gift is tax deductible.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.091
I know. I donated last year.

04:18.836 --> 04:20.255
Is that all?

04:21.720 --> 04:24.430
Um, you still going
to Malibu this weekend?

04:24.473 --> 04:26.608
Of course. I was always going.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.390
I was on the fence,

04:29.436 --> 04:32.412
but, you know, it is
Kelli's birthday trip.

04:33.131 --> 04:35.769
You wanna go half on a
birthday gift this year?

04:35.818 --> 04:38.188
I already got her a gift.

04:38.237 --> 04:42.317
Okay, well, I guess I'll just get
her a gift card from Macaroni Grill.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.826
You know she love to
color on the placemats.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.158
Just hella excited.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.639
Do whatever you want,
Issa. You always do.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.828
- Okay. I guess I'll just...
- What was that?

04:53.877 --> 04:56.647
Yep! Gotta go. All
right, I gotta go. Bye.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.423
Okay.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.236
Shut the fuck up!

06:02.042 --> 06:03.726
Holy shit!

06:03.751 --> 06:06.032
Wow, are you kidding me with this shit?

06:06.075 --> 06:07.815
Oh!

06:07.868 --> 06:11.101
Here are the keys. Uh, Wi-Fi
password's on the fridge.

06:11.126 --> 06:12.748
I already started heating the pool.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.583
- And there's firewood by the casita.
- There's a casita?

06:15.608 --> 06:18.919
- Yeah.
- What is a casita?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.252
- She doesn't have nice things.
- I don't.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.128
- Have fun!
- Thank you.

06:24.453 --> 06:25.723
Okay, ladies.

06:25.748 --> 06:28.803
So, there's two bedrooms
downstairs. There's two upstairs.

06:28.828 --> 06:32.203
I'm gonna take the room upstairs
because I want the view, so...

06:32.960 --> 06:35.271
I'll take upstairs with you.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.015
Okay.

06:44.646 --> 06:47.494
You ever see someone
scream themself awake?

06:47.968 --> 06:49.098
No.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.579
I want y'all on your worst behavior

06:57.626 --> 07:01.336
'cause this weekend I'm
bringing back "We did say!"

07:01.380 --> 07:03.510
Oh, no. Not "we did say."

07:03.549 --> 07:05.669
- We are too old for that.
- Oh, no.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.587
You know the rules... no saying no.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.264
I'm not spending
another night in county.

07:09.289 --> 07:10.975
- Mm.
- It wasn't that bad!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.102
That's how Molly figured out
she wanted to be a lawyer.

07:13.142 --> 07:15.812
- We did say.
- Yo, I'm down.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.023
Okay, as long as it's
marriage-friendly, I'm down, too.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.770
Okay, it's my birthday, Tiffany.

07:21.795 --> 07:24.225
Fuck your marriage!

07:24.278 --> 07:26.438
- And, Issa, get off your phone!
- Right?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.568
Get off Shade Room.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.309
Uh-uh. What's going on between y'all?

07:31.334 --> 07:34.076
Nothing. I'm ready to
have fun with my girls.

07:34.756 --> 07:37.490
Yeah, me, too. I am down for whatever.

07:37.537 --> 07:39.037
Okay, Molly.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.935
I want you to touch that waiter's ass.

07:44.683 --> 07:46.748
We did say.

07:46.805 --> 07:48.451
Coming right up.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.013
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.644
Molly, did you just touch his dick?

07:59.688 --> 08:02.768
Oh, she said be on your
worst behavior. I'm on mine.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.726
Ah! I love it!

08:05.777 --> 08:07.527
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.241
Okay, Issa, your turn.

08:09.842 --> 08:12.161
Well, I didn't get you a
gift, so I guess I'm down.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.912
We did say.

08:13.937 --> 08:15.449
Bitch, I just said I was down.

08:15.474 --> 08:18.037
Ooh, my bad. I was
reading your eyebrows.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.501
They are very expressive.

♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

08:23.967 --> 08:25.076

Y'all know I wished for dick.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.420
Oh, man, I needed this.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.939
Since I got engaged,

08:45.984 --> 08:49.574
all I do is look at flowers and
taste test little cakes and shit.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.403
It's like I'm really getting married.

08:51.825 --> 08:53.535
Yo, you know what's crazy?

08:53.560 --> 08:56.490
Issa and I just looked at rings, too.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.271
Fuck.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.974
Shit's just fucked up, man.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.789
I'm not saying I got
shit together for her,

09:04.836 --> 09:08.279
but I got shit together for her, man.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.298
So, what?

09:11.343 --> 09:13.302
You really done with the ole girl?

09:13.709 --> 09:16.300
- Y'all got history, man.
- Oh, if you was me,

09:16.348 --> 09:19.308
could you just be like, "Hey, you fucked
another nigga, but it's all right"?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.061
Hell, the fuck no.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.403
Shit, I almost punched a dude
at Whole Foods the other day

09:23.438 --> 09:26.108
'cause he asked Leah if she
wanted him to double bag it.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.189
But you a different
type of dude than me.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.865
In what way?

09:30.138 --> 09:32.241
My heart pumps cold.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.099
And you an "R&B, singing all
your feelings" type nigga.

09:35.654 --> 09:37.302
That's cool. That's you.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.896
I like you for that.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.368
Fuck that.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.997
Yo, you know what? Fuck
all this sad shit, man.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.804
Hey, call Brandon and Mike,
and let's go out tomorrow.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.799
Let's go to a club, something.

09:51.842 --> 09:54.224
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.967
All right.

09:57.992 --> 09:59.740
Hell, yeah.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.694
- Okay.
- Oh, shit!

10:06.732 --> 10:09.482
- This is my song!
- Oh, girl, we did say!

10:09.526 --> 10:12.356
- Yes, we did!
- Okay.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.788
Get it, get it, get it.

10:16.788 --> 10:18.115
Hey, how y'all doing?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.450
- Hi!
- Hi.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.209
Are you Jill Scott? You
look just like Jill Scott.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.717
Oh, my God, you look
just like "Twilight"...

10:26.742 --> 10:27.764
- okay?
- Okay.

10:38.436 --> 10:40.011
You okay?

10:40.057 --> 10:42.307
I'm great.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.037
So, what's Lawrence got
planned for this weekend?

10:45.334 --> 10:47.102
He's chilling.

10:47.704 --> 10:49.842
Well, I know he misses you.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.670
Yeah.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.616
Be right back.

10:56.641 --> 10:58.912
Those college boys are
really trying to get it.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.620
- Girl, they are not the only ones.
- Okay!

11:01.661 --> 11:05.331
- We did say!
- Are you getting any reception in here?

11:05.374 --> 11:07.924
Ugh, yes.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.629
If Derek texts me one more time...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.840
I tell him I'm okay,
but he still worries.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.389
- He's so extra.
- Yeah, he is.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.967
This song goes out to my
girl, Kelli, on her birthday!

11:22.015 --> 11:24.715
- Whoo!
- Oh, shit!

11:24.768 --> 11:28.808
- Hey, get it, Kelli!
- This is my jam.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.015
Issa, come on, dance!

11:30.065 --> 11:32.355
- Okay.
- We did say!

11:53.880 --> 11:55.309
Oh, thank you!

11:58.635 --> 12:00.795
Okay, girl, you're missing your mouth.

12:00.846 --> 12:03.466
Then they're gonna have to wipe it down.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.788
Yes.

12:26.602 --> 12:28.904
Molly, what are you doing?

12:29.162 --> 12:31.318
I'm rolling with Kelli. What?

12:31.666 --> 12:34.836
Are you really about to go
off with that baby of a man?

12:35.654 --> 12:37.547
Look, this isn't "we did say."

12:37.591 --> 12:40.221
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, I know. I want to.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.050
You know, it's not like
I'm trying to keep a nigga.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.715
You know me.

12:56.651 --> 13:00.991
So, uh, should I play some
music or something like that?

13:01.031 --> 13:04.371
I have, like, a week left on my
trial subscription to TIDAL, like...

13:04.409 --> 13:06.779
Shut the fuck up.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.619
So, you and Molly really
went in last night, huh?

14:27.659 --> 14:32.659
Yeah, but my ass ended up facedown
on my bed alone, drawers still on.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.616
I mean, I bought that little
boy hella drinks last night.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.837
Men these days are hella trifling.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.063
Just be thankful you have Lawrence.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.149
Yeah.

14:45.270 --> 14:46.680
What's wrong?

14:47.721 --> 14:49.509
Something going on
with you and Lawrence?

14:52.892 --> 14:56.852
You know how I've been super down
on Lawrence for a minute, right?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.356
Yeah.

14:58.478 --> 14:59.978
Well, we...

15:01.484 --> 15:03.824
The other day, some shit went down...

15:03.862 --> 15:05.341
Girl, did he hit you?

15:05.366 --> 15:07.242
What? No.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.282
Okay, I like Lawrence, but I
will go ape on that nigga, okay?

15:10.327 --> 15:11.407
- Does he have a car?
- Kelli.

15:11.436 --> 15:12.653
I know he has a car. You know what?

15:12.678 --> 15:15.708
- I'm gonna fuck that up first.
- He did not hit me.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.879
Okay? We're... we're just going through
this, like, really rough patch...

15:18.918 --> 15:20.998
You're pregnant. I knew it.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.666
I bet Tiffany you would slip up.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.134
And as much as I need that
$100, I'm not trying...

15:25.175 --> 15:27.755
I'm not pregnant, okay?

15:27.802 --> 15:31.722
And you know what? I...
I'm just... I'm tripping.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.595
It's fine. Don't even trip.

15:33.642 --> 15:36.642
Then why you get me all
upset for no... for no reason?

15:36.686 --> 15:38.766
I'm sorry for making this about me.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.313
Yeah, make it about... it's my birthday.

15:40.338 --> 15:41.351
Yeah.

15:41.376 --> 15:44.059
It'll be about you if you
get hit or have a baby.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.654
Do you... do you listen to yourself?

15:47.697 --> 15:50.038
All the time. I have a podcast.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.913
- Of course these heifers are late.
- Ugh, who cares?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.616
They're probably at the crib passed out.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.497
I mean, no shade, but just
once, can they not be basic?

16:01.544 --> 16:04.714
Right? Issa always trying to judge
somebody for how they live their life,

16:04.756 --> 16:06.336
but this bitch is too
afraid to live her own.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.973
"You're doing too much." Shut up!

16:09.017 --> 16:11.033
I mean, you know how
your ratchet friends are.

16:11.058 --> 16:12.126
Mm.

16:12.650 --> 16:15.322
Look who showed up. Where's Kelli?

16:15.495 --> 16:16.689
She's resting.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.431
She said she'll meet
us at the hot tub later.

16:20.650 --> 16:23.355
Next up is our 2013 Zin.

16:23.407 --> 16:24.791
Oh.

16:24.816 --> 16:26.368
Thank you.

16:30.634 --> 16:32.953
- I think I taste stone fruit.
- Mm.

16:32.978 --> 16:34.662
And a little bit of pepper.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.993
Yes! I tasted it, too!

16:37.038 --> 16:40.376
- Look at us.
- I taste wine.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.431
Mm.

16:58.027 --> 16:59.500
Hey, this nigga stupid, though.

16:59.525 --> 17:01.392
But you know what?
I'm telling the truth!

17:01.438 --> 17:03.268
These new black bitches,
man, they be on some bullshit.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.364
Because half of them didn't
have no daddy in the house.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.530
They don't know what a real
relationship's supposed to look like.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.279
Hey, I tell Candace all the time,

17:09.319 --> 17:11.400
"Hey, sometimes marriage sucks.

17:11.454 --> 17:13.244
- "Deal with it."
- You know what it is?

17:13.282 --> 17:16.358
These women today, they wanna be the
woman and the man in the relationship.

17:16.384 --> 17:17.704
That's why they ass
ain't never satisfied.

17:17.729 --> 17:19.332
They some "never happy" bitches.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.872
Issa was like that all
the fucking time, man.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.126
It was either some shit about
work or some shit about me.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.339
It was like, fuck! Just chill.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.048
Hey, they don't make black
women like they used to.

17:28.073 --> 17:30.720
My grandmama was a rider. She
ain't leave 'cause she wasn't happy.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.339
Exactly! My granddad used to
cheat on my grandma all the time.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.006
Nigga had a second
family and everything.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.514
She stuck with him till the end.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.165
Damn, her pussy fat.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.477
Yeah.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.598
I know it don't seem like it right now,

17:42.645 --> 17:44.900
but, my nigga, it's gonna be
popping for you in the streets.

17:44.925 --> 17:45.906
What you mean?

17:45.931 --> 17:47.642
Shit flipped back in niggas' favor now.

17:47.884 --> 17:50.322
All the girls that were in their
20s, used to be all picky and shit,

17:50.361 --> 17:52.821
they in their 30s and 40s
now and thirsty as fuck.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.189
Man, come on.

17:54.214 --> 17:56.454
Mike, show him the girl
you were just fucking with.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.913
- Mm.
- Show him the bitch.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.998
- Damn!
- Mm-hmm.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.703
- So, it's like that?
- Damn!

18:03.728 --> 18:05.298
Man, I tell a girl out the gate,

18:05.323 --> 18:07.498
"You ain't suck dick on the first
date, I ain't fucking with you."

18:07.545 --> 18:09.415
♪ And they do! ♪

18:11.900 --> 18:13.798
Hey.

18:19.111 --> 18:21.431
I got you. Come on.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.017
Yeah, my man!

18:24.042 --> 18:25.483
Man!

18:25.522 --> 18:27.272
- Yes!
- You better get it!

18:27.315 --> 18:29.145
- My man! He ain't gonna do shit.
- Probably not.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.282
Ain't doing shit at all.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.125
You're cute.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.550
Oh, shit. My bad.

18:56.790 --> 18:58.934
You're one of those nice guys, huh?

18:59.470 --> 19:01.012
Nah.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.267
- Nah?
- Nah.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.389
Then show me.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.488
What about him?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.824
He's cool.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.673
I can have fun with that.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.328
How much fun?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.423
That depends.

19:37.374 --> 19:38.381
On what?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.678
On how much you want it.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.602
200 for head, 400 to fuck.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.149
Tomorrow, we can just chill.

19:53.174 --> 19:55.027
So, I was thinking we could
leave after, like, a late brunch.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.322
I know this really cute... oh, my God!

19:58.221 --> 20:00.042
Bitch, we did say!

20:00.067 --> 20:02.363
Oh, my God. Why you looking
at me like you Stacey Dash

20:02.388 --> 20:04.172
and I just told you you black?

20:04.197 --> 20:05.454
- God.
- None of that.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.866
Marriage has made you boring. Issa,
it's your turn next. We did say.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.457
Uh, no, we didn't. I'm good, thanks.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.962
Whatever. I'll take her go.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.594
And can y'all make it good this time?

20:14.631 --> 20:16.446
- Challenge a ho.
- Okay.

20:16.478 --> 20:19.098
I mean, we can't really top what
you did with that guy last night.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.755
Don't be mad 'cause I got game.

20:23.362 --> 20:25.735
You know what? Give her something.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.889
New Molly's got it.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.539
Yes. Yes, she does.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.527
So, we just... we
just all gonna sit here

20:37.570 --> 20:40.700
and pretend new Molly
ain't the same bitch

20:40.740 --> 20:42.820
that we've known for forever?

20:42.867 --> 20:45.117
I wasn't gonna say anything,

20:45.161 --> 20:47.411
but, like, how is new Molly different?

20:47.455 --> 20:49.905
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I embrace who I am, okay?

20:49.958 --> 20:53.383
I do what I want and I do not
give a fuck what anybody thinks.

20:53.758 --> 20:56.877
Old boy from the club was
cute, so I got with him.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.053
But that's what you always do.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.183
No, no, no.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.727
- Now she embraces it.
- Oh!

21:04.752 --> 21:07.719
So, new Molly sabotages
her life on purpose.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.678
Oh! Okay, okay, okay.

21:09.703 --> 21:13.517
So, new Molly chooses for niggas
to walk up out of her life.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.734
- Got it. Cool, cool, cool.
- Cool.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.172
'Kay, 'kay, 'kay.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.288
Kelli, why are you always
coming for somebody?

21:22.313 --> 21:24.071
Why you coming at me?

21:24.117 --> 21:26.077
Because you make everything a joke.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.039
Like, you're 30 and you
fucking act like you're 19.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.134
- Mm.
- And, bitch,

21:30.159 --> 21:31.921
why do you always miss
your big-ass mouth?

21:31.946 --> 21:34.791
- I don't know!
- Kelli, you are a mess.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.786
No, you are, okay?

21:36.838 --> 21:38.628
'Cause you're always
telling somebody what to do

21:38.673 --> 21:39.883
or reading everybody.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.924
And meanwhile, your codependent ass

21:41.968 --> 21:44.138
can't even take a shit
without asking your man first.

21:49.267 --> 21:53.180
Well, at least I'm not up here
pretending I have a man when I don't.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.306
Yeah, I know that you
and Lawrence broke up.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.789
- Wait, what?
- Why?

21:56.899 --> 21:58.364
Because she cheated on him.

21:58.393 --> 21:59.578
Lawrence found out about you and Daniel?

21:59.603 --> 22:00.627
You fucked Daniel?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.573
- I don't wanna talk about this.
- That's who it was?

22:02.613 --> 22:04.110
Derek did not tell me that.

22:04.135 --> 22:05.217
Shit, what happened?

22:05.242 --> 22:07.110
I said I don't wanna
talk about it, okay?

22:08.953 --> 22:10.852
Is that why Lawrence hit you?

22:11.789 --> 22:13.409
Kelli, shut the fuck up.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.414
- I mean...
- Oh, shit!

22:18.504 --> 22:19.743
Damn.

22:19.768 --> 22:21.554
Why the fuck would you
say something like that?

22:21.591 --> 22:23.471
It's the facts.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.386
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:33.436 --> 22:36.396
It's so good to hear your voice.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.281
Uh, I'm really glad you called.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.864
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

22:48.680 --> 22:49.962
You?

22:49.987 --> 22:52.523
No, but...

22:55.541 --> 22:57.985
Um, do you need anything?

22:58.609 --> 23:01.401
- I'm good.
- Okay.

23:02.453 --> 23:05.129
- And Chad's good?
- Chad is fine.

23:06.477 --> 23:09.966
Sleeping on his couch isn't, but, yeah.

23:10.014 --> 23:13.774
Well, um, you know,
I'm gone till Monday,

23:13.810 --> 23:17.940
so if you wanna stay at the apartment,

23:17.980 --> 23:20.730
you know, it's quiet.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.141
All right.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.872
Are you okay?

23:32.912 --> 23:36.912
- You already asked me that.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:42.174 --> 23:43.883
I miss you.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.542
I miss you, too.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.179
I don't know, maybe...

23:57.228 --> 23:59.909
maybe we should talk when you get home.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.612
Yeah.

24:04.026 --> 24:06.316
Okay, let... let's do that.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.572
All right.

24:09.724 --> 24:11.210
Okay, bye.

24:11.235 --> 24:12.561
Bye.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.066
I wanna prank call
Derek. Give me your phone.

24:23.091 --> 24:25.046
- I wanna be you.
- You can never be me.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.549
- I will try.
- Whatever.

24:26.591 --> 24:29.221
- Guys, I need to go home.
- What, now?

24:29.260 --> 24:32.542
Yeah. Lawrence wants to
talk and I need to see him.

24:33.003 --> 24:35.056
It's 1:00 in the morning.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.152
I'm too drunk to do anything.

24:41.704 --> 24:43.304
You know what? It's fine.

24:43.329 --> 24:44.959
I'll figure it out.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.595
I'm not trying to get another DUI.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.568
No, you do not need another one.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.486
And another one and another one.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.035
And another one!

24:58.831 --> 25:00.621
40 minutes?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.536
Fucking Uber.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.825
Shit.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.013
Come on.

25:35.018 --> 25:36.829
We're almost there.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.539
Yeah.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.331
You know what you're
gonna say when you see him?

25:44.377 --> 25:45.917
I don't know.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.710
Practice on me.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.234
- I'm so sorry...
- Fuck you!

26:02.259 --> 26:04.189
- What the fuck?!
- Worst-case scenario, girl.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.204
I'm just trying to keep you
woke. All right, try it again.

26:14.824 --> 26:17.399
I'm really sorry for hurting you.

26:18.160 --> 26:22.391
And I can't imagine my life without you.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.748
You're my best friend and...

26:27.253 --> 26:29.446
you're my body goals.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.451
You were right about me.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.849
I'm a fucking mess.

26:48.316 --> 26:51.566
I just... I don't wanna
be who y'all think I am.

26:52.015 --> 26:53.435
So, don't be.

26:53.460 --> 26:54.710
How?

26:55.950 --> 26:57.120
You asking me?

27:01.620 --> 27:05.404
But I'ma be here while
you figure it out.

27:09.701 --> 27:12.755
So, can we be friends again, or...?

27:12.798 --> 27:16.146
Bitch, I am on the PCH
at 2:00 in the morning.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.639
Hello?

27:23.664 --> 27:25.894
Y'all really just took my car?!

27:25.919 --> 27:27.563
Give me the phone! Kelli!

27:27.605 --> 27:29.555
FYI, don't speed.

27:29.607 --> 27:32.317
I got edibles under the seat.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.650
- This bitch.
- Bye-bye.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.179
I knew she was high the whole trip.

27:36.204 --> 27:37.905
The whole fucking trip!

27:37.948 --> 27:39.408
You want an edible, though?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.120
Nigga!
- No?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.607
I seen this bitch at the market.

27:42.632 --> 27:43.910
She is a bad-ass, my nigga.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.577
I'm tapping on her should...

27:45.640 --> 27:47.661
- What up, blood?
- Yeah.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.788
What's racking, big man?

27:49.835 --> 27:51.665
Nigga, you know I smashed that, too.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.552
- Oh, what the hell, blood?
- Man, I'm strapped.

28:27.118 --> 28:28.427
Text me when you get home.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.972
Oh, baby, yes!

30:02.403 --> 30:04.583
I know.
