00:02.918 --> 00:04.064
Jessie, you really

00:04.065 --> 00:05.209
didn't have to come

00:02.918 --> 00:05.209
and get me.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.709
You mean, I should've

00:06.710 --> 00:08.167
just let you walk home

00:05.250 --> 00:08.167
in your pajamas at 2:00 a.m.?

00:09.083 --> 00:10.959
- No, that would have
- been dangerous.

00:11.334 --> 00:12.876
- I could've taken
- the subway.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.147
Or you could've

00:15.148 --> 00:16.334
just stayed at Nick's

00:13.959 --> 00:16.334
party until morning.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.476
- (LAUGHS)
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

00:17.500 --> 00:19.018
- That seems kind of crazy,
- doesn't it?

00:19.042 --> 00:20.125
To stay there all night?

00:21.751 --> 00:23.292
- It's called
- a sleep-over!

00:23.334 --> 00:25.815
- The terms of - the arrangement are
- Right there in the name.

00:28.042 --> 00:29.313
How am I supposed

00:29.314 --> 00:30.584
to sleep over

00:28.042 --> 00:30.584
if I can't sleep?

00:30.876 --> 00:31.959
What was the problem?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.542
- Bad dreams?
- Bad bean dip?

00:34.751 --> 00:35.876
No...

00:36.167 --> 00:37.834
I missed Kenny.

00:38.167 --> 00:39.417
Kenny the koala?

00:39.459 --> 00:41.000
No, Kenny the plumber.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.500
- Of course,
- Kenny the koala!

00:44.083 --> 00:46.000
- He's my bedtime buddy.

You are a koala-holic.

I am not.

Now I'm going upstairs,

you are in my chair.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.563
Sorry, but the convergence

03:08.564 --> 03:10.042
of air streams from the vents

03:10.083 --> 03:11.709
is creating

03:11.710 --> 03:13.334
a dangerous draft

on the guest chair.

03:14.709 --> 03:16.000
Fine.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.480
But if I catch a cold

03:18.481 --> 03:19.876
and start sneezing

03:17.083 --> 03:19.876
uncontrollably,

03:19.918 --> 03:21.189
it will be on you.

Here you go.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.000
- Sweet-smelling soaps
- for my sweetie!

03:28.500 --> 03:29.689
You call me

03:29.690 --> 03:30.876
"sweetie" again,

03:30.918 --> 03:32.751
- and you're gonna be
- eating some knuckles.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.626
So, you don't

03:34.627 --> 03:35.751
want the gift?

03:35.792 --> 03:37.292
Oh, I'm taking the gift.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.167
Luke,

03:43.209 --> 03:44.480
I think we should talk

03:44.481 --> 03:45.751
about the koala problem.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.563
What problem?

03:47.564 --> 03:49.000
There's no problem.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.584
I think there might be.

03:53.751 --> 03:55.071
- You can't sleep
- without Kenny.

03:55.667 --> 03:56.855
And now, he's

03:56.856 --> 03:58.042
a stowaway in your pants.

03:59.667 --> 04:00.710
Okay, last night

04:00.711 --> 04:01.751
was kind of rough.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.564
So, of course, I need

04:03.565 --> 04:05.334
some extra Kenny-time.

04:06.459 --> 04:08.059
- I checked out this
- great nanny website

04:08.083 --> 04:09.244
- And I think
- it could help.

04:09.876 --> 04:11.500
What did the website say?

04:11.542 --> 04:13.272
That the best way to

04:13.273 --> 04:15.000
overcome separation anxiety

04:11.542 --> 04:15.000
is to start small.

04:15.042 --> 04:16.750
- How about giving Kenny
- up for a week?

04:17.083 --> 04:19.041
No way! Two hours.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.041
- Three days.
- An hour!

04:20.083 --> 04:21.459
- Two days.
- Half an hour!

04:22.584 --> 04:24.864
- Yeah, I don't think - you're getting
- The hang of this.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.542
- Here's what
- we're gonna do.

04:26.584 --> 04:27.626
I'm going to keep Kenny

04:27.627 --> 04:28.667
until tomorrow night.

04:28.709 --> 04:29.834
Tomorrow night?

04:29.835 --> 04:30.959
I'll never make it!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.417
That is pathetic.

04:32.459 --> 04:34.125
- It's just
- a stuffed animal!

04:34.167 --> 04:35.876
Oh, yeah?

04:35.918 --> 04:37.751
- And, uh, what's
- Chubby the Bear?

04:38.083 --> 04:39.876
Hey, I'm eight!

04:39.918 --> 04:41.751
On me, it's cute.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.000
I'll say.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.083
Uh, Luke?

04:47.792 --> 04:49.542
- Yeah? - You gonna leave
- The bear?

04:50.083 --> 04:51.083
Of course.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.856
I'm telling you,

04:58.857 --> 05:00.751
Stuart is obsessed

04:56.959 --> 05:00.751
with me.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.584
- Come on.
- You're exaggerating.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.083
(ZURI SCREAMS)

05:05.584 --> 05:06.918
Stuart!

05:08.000 --> 05:09.042
Right here, my angel.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.522
Do you like it?

05:10.523 --> 05:11.959
Zuart is our 'ship name.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.418
Oh! You're buying me

05:14.419 --> 05:15.709
a ship?

05:17.083 --> 05:19.042
He means relationship.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.459
Well, then forget it!

05:22.083 --> 05:23.083
I hate Zuart!

05:23.709 --> 05:25.000
I hear what you're saying.

05:25.042 --> 05:26.584
I'll change it to Sturi.

05:31.253 --> 05:32.626
is on too tight.

05:36.876 --> 05:38.500
- Jessie,
- we don't need to do this.

05:38.542 --> 05:39.959
I can sleep in my room.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.834

05:41.876 --> 05:43.292
- if you want to
- break a habit,

05:43.334 --> 05:44.417
It's good to get out

05:44.418 --> 05:45.500
of the environment

05:43.334 --> 05:45.500
that triggers it.

05:50.543 --> 05:51.543
back to my room?

05:51.584 --> 05:53.106
Sure you are.

05:53.107 --> 05:54.626
As soon as you get used

05:51.584 --> 05:54.626
to sleeping without Kenny.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.959

- Harry was about
- to size my foot!

07:09.083 --> 07:10.167
Everything okay?

07:11.083 --> 07:13.042
- What were you doing
- in my room?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.667
- I couldn't sleep
- in the guest room.

- hear you people!

07:25.876 --> 07:27.834
Huh. I wonder if whales

07:27.835 --> 07:29.792
listen to sounds of you

07:25.876 --> 07:29.792
complaining to get to sleep?

07:31.083 --> 07:32.918
Just keep quiet.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.834
- And we do not
- have dust mites!

- Usually he's - clinging to you like
- A wet bathing suit.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.250
- I keep giving him
- stuff to do,

08:09.292 --> 08:10.626
So he can focus

08:10.627 --> 08:11.959
on something besides me.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.813
Dearest, I completed

08:14.814 --> 08:16.250
your math homework.

Like you complete me.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.730
Good work.

I hope you got

08:20.125 --> 08:23.334
a few wrong.

I don't want the teachers

08:24.814 --> 08:26.250

08:23.375 --> 08:26.250
too much from me.

08:32.918 --> 08:34.434
- Do you have a decent
- maid of honor dress?

08:34.458 --> 08:35.833
Duh.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.918
- But you're going
- about this all wrong.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.563
If you want a girl

08:40.563 --> 08:42.042
to like you,

08:39.082 --> 08:42.042
or hate you less,

08:42.208 --> 08:44.000
- you need to give her
- some space.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.042
And have some confidence.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.000
- You're polite,
- you're smart, and...

08:48.292 --> 08:49.876
- You can really rock
- a sweater vest.

08:50.792 --> 08:52.334
- I can?
- Yes!

08:53.083 --> 08:54.542
And remember,

08:54.543 --> 08:56.000
Zuri isn't the only

08:53.083 --> 08:56.000
fish in the sea.

08:56.918 --> 08:57.959
I'd love to hear more

08:57.960 --> 08:59.000
of your advice on

08:56.918 --> 08:59.000
matters of the heart.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.751
Can you meet me at

09:00.752 --> 09:02.125
the park in an hour?

08:59.375 --> 09:02.125
Okay.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.605
But in the meantime,

09:04.606 --> 09:06.167
you might want to

09:03.042 --> 09:06.167
take down this,

09:06.209 --> 09:08.083
before Zuri punches that!

09:13.083 --> 09:16.000
Over here, Em my gem!

09:16.167 --> 09:17.209
What's all this?

09:17.250 --> 09:19.042
- A romantic lunch
- for my new beloved.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.000
- I'm wearing
- my picnic pants!

09:22.083 --> 09:23.125
Salmon croquette?

09:24.125 --> 09:26.334
(SCREAMING) No!

09:27.250 --> 09:30.292
So, not a fan of salmon.

09:31.042 --> 09:32.042
Three bean salad?

09:38.417 --> 09:39.834
(YAWNING)

09:39.835 --> 09:41.250
Boy, am I beat.

09:38.417 --> 09:41.250
Time for bed!

09:42.500 --> 09:44.000
- It's 3:00
- in the afternoon.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.375
Is it?

09:48.542 --> 09:49.855
Nice try, but you

09:49.856 --> 09:51.167
don't get Kenny back

09:48.542 --> 09:51.167
for six more hours.

09:51.459 --> 09:53.000
(SIGHS) Please!

09:53.209 --> 09:55.083
- I just want to
- make sure he's okay.

09:55.334 --> 09:57.042
Luke, we made a deal.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.188
And you've been

09:58.189 --> 09:59.292
doing really well.

09:59.334 --> 10:00.647
Except for ransacking my

10:00.648 --> 10:01.959
room, looking for Kenny.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.022
I wasn't

10:03.023 --> 10:04.042
looking for Kenny!

10:04.083 --> 10:05.583
I was looking

10:05.584 --> 10:07.083
for a book to read.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.083
Oh, really?

10:09.084 --> 10:10.084
Spell "book."

10:10.375 --> 10:12.042
- I don't have time
- for a pop quiz!

10:15.083 --> 10:16.918
- I just want to know
- if Kenny's all right.

10:16.959 --> 10:18.647
Luke, he is absolutely,

10:18.648 --> 10:20.334
100% perfectly fine.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.000
We have a slight issue.

10:27.584 --> 10:28.918
(GASPS)

10:29.375 --> 10:35.459
Oh... What is this?

10:36.083 --> 10:37.375
Lizard spittle.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.501
Oh! That is the second

10:40.502 --> 10:41.876
most disgusting thing

10:39.125 --> 10:41.876
I have ever touched!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Don't ask.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.959
I truly apologize,

10:47.042 --> 10:48.542
but why did you

10:48.543 --> 10:50.042
give me the koala

10:47.042 --> 10:50.042
in the first place?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.355
Because I knew

10:51.356 --> 10:52.626
Luke would go through

10:50.083 --> 10:52.626
my room.

10:52.667 --> 10:53.834
He does that

10:53.835 --> 10:55.000
even when I'm

10:52.667 --> 10:55.000
not hiding his stuff.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.063
I never thought

10:57.064 --> 10:58.125
Kipling would

10:56.000 --> 10:58.125
try to eat Kenny!

10:58.167 --> 10:59.438
Really? Have you seen

10:59.439 --> 11:00.709
my stuffed animal

10:58.167 --> 11:00.709
collection?

11:00.751 --> 11:02.417
- You don't have one.
- Exactly!

11:06.292 --> 11:07.668
Look, Stuart,

11:07.669 --> 11:09.042
I appreciate the picnic,

11:09.083 --> 11:10.126
but I think I gave you

11:10.127 --> 11:11.167
the wrong idea.

11:11.209 --> 11:12.209
About what?

11:12.584 --> 11:14.000
- I'd say
- pretty much everything.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.125
So my love for you

11:16.126 --> 11:17.126
is unrequited?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.083
Yes! And unnerving.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.584
Perhaps a bit

11:21.585 --> 11:23.000
of sparkling cider

11:20.167 --> 11:23.000
will change your mind.

11:28.125 --> 11:29.355
Rock climbing's

11:29.356 --> 11:30.584
gonna cost you extra.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.626
(LAUGHING)

11:35.167 --> 11:36.334
Now he's hitting on Emma!

11:37.125 --> 11:38.125
Priceless!

11:39.626 --> 11:41.000
Excuse me.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.626
- Please get him
- away from me.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.334
Oh, come on, Emma.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.000
He's been bugging Zuri

11:44.667 --> 11:48.000
for so long.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.000
- Why can't you take
- a turn being nice to him?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.367
- Aren't you the one - getting paid to be
- Nice to him?

11:53.083 --> 11:54.417
(IMITATES PHONE RINGING)

11:56.083 --> 11:58.000
Oh, hello, Mr. President.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.122
Sorry, I have to take this.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.583
Emma!

12:02.584 --> 12:04.083
Your sparkling cider

12:01.083 --> 12:04.083
is going flat!

12:07.250 --> 12:09.059
- I should've just
- walked out of that picnic.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.125
Why didn't you?

12:11.167 --> 12:13.059
- My feet were too tingly
- from the foot massage.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.500
He's not without skills.

12:15.751 --> 12:17.667
- (SCREAMS)
- Look at my door!

12:17.709 --> 12:19.042
(LAUGHING)

12:19.584 --> 12:20.772
Me and Stuart

12:20.773 --> 12:21.959
on the Titanic?

12:22.125 --> 12:23.125
Add my door

12:23.126 --> 12:24.126
to the list of victims!

12:25.083 --> 12:26.083
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

12:28.083 --> 12:30.042
- Hey, Jessie,
- I've got a riddle for you.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.000
Oh, I love riddles!

12:33.083 --> 12:34.209
What's pink and fluffy

12:34.210 --> 12:35.334
and could scar a child

12:33.083 --> 12:35.334
for life?

12:35.626 --> 12:36.626
No idea.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.083
(JESSIE GASPS)

12:40.083 --> 12:41.105
Why did you

12:41.106 --> 12:42.125
turn Kenny pink?

12:42.167 --> 12:43.625
Why did you

12:43.626 --> 12:45.083
put a bear in with

12:42.167 --> 12:45.083
my new red sweat pants?

12:45.417 --> 12:47.101
- You didn't tell me
- you were doing a red load!

12:47.125 --> 12:49.209
- You didn't tell me
- you were doing a koala load!

12:53.083 --> 12:54.563
Stuart, I might've

12:54.564 --> 12:56.042
been a little mean

12:53.083 --> 12:56.042
to you yesterday,

12:56.083 --> 12:57.147
so I want to

12:57.148 --> 12:58.209
make it up to you.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.334
Here's my homework.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.918
Sorry, I only do

13:02.919 --> 13:04.167
Emma's homework now.

13:04.792 --> 13:06.751
If you'll excuse me,

13:06.752 --> 13:08.709
I have a lot of I's

13:04.792 --> 13:08.709
to dot with tiny hearts.

13:09.459 --> 13:10.563
So that's it?

13:10.564 --> 13:11.667
You're with Emma now?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.042
- You should be happy
- I'm dating someone else.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.667
- It's obvious
- you don't like me.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.147
What'd I do

13:17.148 --> 13:18.209
to make you think that?

13:20.375 --> 13:21.688
You shoved me down

13:21.689 --> 13:23.000
the garbage chute!

13:24.083 --> 13:25.126
Hey, I thought

13:25.127 --> 13:26.167
we were playing tag!

13:32.083 --> 13:34.083
It's Kenny-time!

13:34.125 --> 13:35.125
Give me that bear!

13:36.125 --> 13:38.206
- Kenny's outside drying.
- I gave him a little bath.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.043
It's a thing where you

13:41.044 --> 13:42.584
pour water on yourself

13:39.500 --> 13:42.584
to get clean.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.000
Oh, there's my boy!

13:46.751 --> 13:48.059
- How come you didn't
- put him in the dryer?

13:48.083 --> 13:49.417
- Oh, his label said
- not to.

13:50.209 --> 13:51.438
It also says

13:51.439 --> 13:52.667
he's recommended

13:50.209 --> 13:52.667
for ages two to six.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.209
- Oh, allow me
- to un-clip Kenny.

13:58.292 --> 14:01.042
Luke, I'm so proud of you.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.724
- You know, - I always knew
- You could...

14:03.083 --> 14:04.083
(SCREAMING)

14:04.084 --> 14:05.084
No! Kenny!

14:05.667 --> 14:07.000
(SCREAMING)

14:13.751 --> 14:14.834
Oh...

14:14.876 --> 14:15.938
Kenny is such

14:15.939 --> 14:17.000
a tough little guy.

14:17.292 --> 14:19.167
- I really hope
- he survived the fall.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.834
I think he did

14:20.835 --> 14:22.042
survive the fall...

14:22.417 --> 14:23.793
But not getting skewered

14:23.794 --> 14:25.167
by this taxi antenna.

14:25.209 --> 14:26.459
(SCREAMS)

14:27.083 --> 14:28.209
Or being squished

14:28.210 --> 14:29.334
by that garbage truck.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.335
Or getting trampled

14:32.336 --> 14:33.876
by that mounted policeman.

14:33.918 --> 14:35.000
Oh...

14:36.083 --> 14:37.924
- Or getting his leg
- chewed off by the horse.

14:39.459 --> 14:40.835
Somehow I feel like

14:40.836 --> 14:42.209
this is all my fault.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.125
That's because it is!

14:45.250 --> 14:46.564
Not the chewed leg.

14:46.565 --> 14:47.876
That's clearly on the horse.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.584
Luke, my condolences.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.167
I got an extra

14:52.168 --> 14:53.250
shopping bag

14:51.083 --> 14:53.250
to put the parts in.

14:54.876 --> 14:56.084
You went shopping

14:56.085 --> 14:57.292
at a time like this?

14:57.751 --> 14:59.000
Shopping is for the living.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.355
I was setting up

15:05.356 --> 15:06.584
an investment portfolio

15:04.125 --> 15:06.584
for Emma.

15:06.626 --> 15:07.667
What'd I miss?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.042
- Luke's koala - took a tumble
- Off the terrace,

15:12.083 --> 15:14.000
- And it didn't
- end well.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.105
This is the surgical

15:17.106 --> 15:18.667
challenge I've been waiting

15:15.542 --> 15:18.667
for my whole life!

15:19.125 --> 15:21.000
I can save this koala!

15:21.250 --> 15:22.250
BOTH: You can?

15:22.292 --> 15:24.042
Yes! But first,

15:24.083 --> 15:25.251
does the patient

15:25.252 --> 15:26.417
have any pre-existing

15:24.083 --> 15:26.417
conditions?

15:27.125 --> 15:28.846
- Well, Creepy Connie
- ripped his head off.

15:29.209 --> 15:30.409
- I'll put that
- on his chart.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.042
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:32.083 --> 15:33.126
I'm gonna go put on

15:33.127 --> 15:34.167
my surgery pants!

15:40.167 --> 15:41.209
Let's start closing

15:41.210 --> 15:42.250
the major incisions.

15:42.751 --> 15:43.918
Embroidery needle.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.417
- That's the one with...
- I know.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.605
I was embroidering

15:47.606 --> 15:49.125
when you were in diapers.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.417
- Safety scissors.
- Safety scissors.

15:58.459 --> 16:00.334
- Juice box.
- Juice box.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.292
- Not grape.
- I hate grape!

16:04.375 --> 16:06.250
My mistake, doctor.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.292
Surgeons,

16:08.293 --> 16:09.500
they're such divas.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.271
Oh, you're welcome,

16:19.272 --> 16:20.500
it was no trouble at all.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.593
- Luke, would you - like some
- Hot chocolate?

16:24.626 --> 16:25.689
Zuri, tell Jessie

16:25.690 --> 16:26.751
thanks to her,

16:26.792 --> 16:27.835
I'm too upset

16:27.836 --> 16:28.876
to drink anything.

16:29.209 --> 16:30.459
Have Emma tell her.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.022
I'm too busy

16:32.023 --> 16:33.334
doing my

16:30.709 --> 16:33.334
own homework.

16:35.334 --> 16:36.792
Get over it, Zuri.

16:36.834 --> 16:37.939
It's not my fault

16:37.940 --> 16:39.042
Stuart noticed

16:36.834 --> 16:39.042
how adorable I am!

16:40.417 --> 16:41.771
It's your fault

16:41.772 --> 16:43.125
that you and Stuart

16:40.417 --> 16:43.125
are a thing!

16:43.167 --> 16:44.292
We are not a thing!

16:44.293 --> 16:45.417
There is no thing!

16:45.459 --> 16:46.584
I don't like him!

16:46.626 --> 16:48.083
Neither do I!

16:48.125 --> 16:49.918
- Then why do you
- care if he likes me?

16:49.959 --> 16:51.293
Because if he's going to do

16:51.294 --> 16:52.626
someone's homework,

16:52.667 --> 16:54.000
massage someone's feet,

16:54.042 --> 16:55.105
and hide someone's

16:55.106 --> 16:56.167
money in

16:54.042 --> 16:56.167
off-shore accounts,

16:56.209 --> 16:57.584
it's gonna be mine!

16:59.167 --> 17:00.230
Ladies, please!

17:00.231 --> 17:01.292
No need to fight.

17:01.334 --> 17:02.417
The doctor's got

17:02.418 --> 17:03.500
the cure for

17:01.334 --> 17:03.500
both of you.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.416
BOTH: Butt out, Stuart!

17:09.459 --> 17:10.791
Luke, please,

17:10.792 --> 17:12.125
you've got to tell me.

17:12.166 --> 17:13.367
- What is it
- about this bear?

17:14.334 --> 17:15.500
I can't talk about it.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.209
It's too embarrassing.

17:18.834 --> 17:19.959
You were walking around

17:19.960 --> 17:21.083
with a koala sticking

17:18.834 --> 17:21.083
out of your pants.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.959
- I think that ship
- has sailed.

17:27.541 --> 17:28.541
Luke,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.393
- I think you'll feel - better if you just
- Explain it to us.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.042
- No one's going to
- laugh at you.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.209
Right, guys?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
BOTH: Right.

17:38.584 --> 17:39.709
Okay.

17:40.876 --> 17:41.938
Kenny and I

17:41.939 --> 17:43.000
came here together.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.209
- He's always
- been there for me.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.918
Before I got adopted,

17:47.959 --> 17:49.334
he was my only family.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.230
Luke, we're your

17:51.231 --> 17:52.375
family now.

17:53.042 --> 17:54.542
Yeah, you have me,

17:54.543 --> 17:56.042
and Emma and Ravi,

17:56.083 --> 17:57.334
and Mom and Dad.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.897
And me. And Bertram, too.

17:58.898 --> 18:00.417
Right, Bertram?

18:00.876 --> 18:02.292
Bertram?

18:02.334 --> 18:03.772
That's the saddest,

18:03.773 --> 18:05.209
sweetest story

18:02.334 --> 18:05.209
I've ever heard!

18:05.250 --> 18:06.375
(SOBBING)

18:08.083 --> 18:09.709
Luke, no matter what,

18:09.710 --> 18:11.334
we will always

18:08.083 --> 18:11.334
be here for you.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.628
- It's never going to be
- just you and your bear.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.250
Thanks, guys.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.000
- Technically,
- he is a marsupial.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.709
How's Luke holding up?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.518
- He's chewed off
- all of his fingernails,

18:31.542 --> 18:33.250
- And I'm afraid
- his toes could be next.

18:35.667 --> 18:36.709
It's done.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.188
The operation

18:39.189 --> 18:40.292
was a success.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.500
Then what's that?

18:44.083 --> 18:45.250
Juice-box hemorrhage.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.375
Occupational hazard.

18:49.667 --> 18:50.834
So, Kenny's okay?

18:51.083 --> 18:52.751
- It was touch-and-go
- for a while.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.042
- He lost
- a lot of stuffing,

18:54.083 --> 18:55.918
- But we were able
- to save him.

19:04.334 --> 19:05.709
Thank you, Ravi.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.417
- And thank you, too,
- Stuart.

19:07.959 --> 19:09.375
You're a miracle worker.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.355
I have a gift.

19:12.356 --> 19:13.626
It would be a sin

19:11.083 --> 19:13.626
not to use it.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.334
Unfortunately,

19:16.335 --> 19:17.584
Kenny did lose an eye.

19:18.584 --> 19:20.147
But luckily,

19:20.148 --> 19:21.709
a donor came through

19:18.584 --> 19:21.709
at the last minute.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.042
It's not a perfect match,

19:30.083 --> 19:31.167
but I thought

19:31.168 --> 19:32.250
you should have it.

19:32.876 --> 19:34.542
- I'm sorry, - I teased you
- About Kenny.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.083
Thanks, Zuri.

19:37.542 --> 19:38.793
You know, Chubby

19:38.794 --> 19:40.042
the Bear's eye would

19:37.542 --> 19:40.042
actually match better...

19:40.083 --> 19:41.542
Touch him and

19:41.543 --> 19:43.000
you'll be picking

19:40.083 --> 19:43.000
your nose with a hook.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.959
Stuart, this is for you.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.709
I realize

19:53.710 --> 19:54.959
there's more to you

19:52.459 --> 19:54.959
than being a pest.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.272
You really come

19:56.273 --> 19:57.459
in handy sometimes.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.772
I was just trying to

19:58.773 --> 20:00.042
make you jealous

19:57.500 --> 20:00.042
and it worked!

20:00.083 --> 20:01.334
You're my one true love!

20:01.375 --> 20:03.000
Emma means nothing to me!

20:03.083 --> 20:04.083
Me neither.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.709
Thank you for my gift.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.397
Hey! Is this the same

20:09.398 --> 20:11.000
basket I gave you?

20:11.626 --> 20:12.918
Uh, what makes you

20:12.919 --> 20:14.209
think that?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.272
The plastic's torn,

20:18.273 --> 20:19.459
there's a hair on the soap,

20:19.500 --> 20:20.751
and the card says

20:20.752 --> 20:22.000
"To Zuri, from Stuart."

20:23.083 --> 20:24.751
Do you want it or not?

20:25.083 --> 20:26.542
Oh, I'm taking the gift!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Jessie...

20:31.792 --> 20:32.897
Listen, I am really sorry

20:32.898 --> 20:34.000
I got so mad at you

20:31.792 --> 20:34.000
after Kenny fell.

20:34.918 --> 20:35.939
I know all this time

20:35.940 --> 20:36.959
you've been trying

20:34.918 --> 20:36.959
to help me.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.709
- Just doing
- the nanny thing.

20:40.459 --> 20:41.667
You know what?

20:42.083 --> 20:44.000
- I think I can sleep
- without Kenny now.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.355
Really? Do you think

20:45.356 --> 20:46.584
finally talking about it

20:46.626 --> 20:48.059
- made you realize
- how many people love you,

20:48.083 --> 20:49.724
- So you don't need
- Kenny quite as much?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.083
Maybe.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.042
- Or, it could be that
- he stinks like bleach,

20:53.083 --> 20:54.563
- And it's burning
- my nostril hairs.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.459
(COUGHING) Well...

20:56.500 --> 20:58.181
- It was either that
- or a hot-pink koala.

20:58.542 --> 20:59.751
Now, let's go find

20:59.752 --> 21:00.959
Kenny a new eye.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.480
- That wonky one
- is freaking me out!

21:10.751 --> 21:12.397
Stuart,

21:12.398 --> 21:14.042
this alphabet soup

21:10.751 --> 21:14.042
is delicious.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.542
Extra vowels,

21:15.543 --> 21:17.000
just the way you like it.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.000
- More sparkling cider,
- please.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.667
Thank you, my good man.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.083
Ever try having

21:28.084 --> 21:29.083
a picnic on

21:27.083 --> 21:29.083
the ground?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.042
Your tip.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.000
- Oh, oh.
- (SCREAMING)

21:35.709 --> 21:37.626
Paging Dr. Stuart...

21:39.500 --> 21:41.042
Bertram, please.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.083
It's his day off.
