WEBVTT

01:57.242 --> 01:59.244
-Daniel, wake up.
-Jesus! What the fuck?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.872
We've gotta get out of Wuhan before 10:00.
They're locking it down.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.999
Locking it down? What? How long?

02:05.167 --> 02:06.418
Roads are already closed.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.384
We're not gonna make another train
if we don't make this.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.929
-Okay.
-Eleven million people had the same idea.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.264
-We've gotta go. Go.
-What's going on?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.349
Hey.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.105
-Temperature check.
-Temperature check?

02:27.189 --> 02:29.483
-They're screening for symptoms.
-Let's go.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.028
Excuse me. Sorry.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.280
'Scuse me. Sorry.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.035
He says we can't.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.495
Tell him who we are.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.180
Let's go, let's go.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.978
Did you tell him that we worked for UBA?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.564
No, I told him
my mother's dying in Beijing.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.790
It's time to wake up, America.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.585
Something big is coming.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.547
To the mountains, to the prairies,

03:34.298 --> 03:39.428
to the redwood forest,
to the amber waves of grain.

03:40.095 --> 03:43.390
From sea to shining sea.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.810
Get ready for an important announcement.

03:46.894 --> 03:51.106
Monday, January 27th at 8:00 a.m.,

03:51.190 --> 03:55.903
Eastern Standard Time on The Morning Show.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.489
Your mornings will never be the same.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.326
Only on UBA.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.453
-Oh, my gosh.
-Hot dog.

04:04.536 --> 04:08.790
You guys, guys, guys,
you've been really busy.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.501
There's a lot of stuff.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.419
-I'm so glad that you liked it.
-Yeah.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.004
For a second there,

04:14.087 --> 04:16.757
I thought I'd wandered
into the wrong screening room.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.134
It's like watching promos
for the Second Coming.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.470
Well, yeah, we hired his ad guys.

04:21.553 --> 04:25.349
And I don't want to take anything
away from Jesus, but this is a big deal.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.352
-We're over the moon, right?
-Way over it. Definitely.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.645
The ads are just the start.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.522
When are you sitting down with Laura?

04:31.605 --> 04:34.775
Actually, we're having a little bit
of difficulty scheduling that.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.984
What's the issue?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.986
-Laura wants two days.
-I talked to Laura.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.323
She wants to follow you as you say goodbye
to the quiet life you've been living

04:41.406 --> 04:42.533
and get ready to come back.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.326
She wants to chronicle that transition.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.537
-That sounds good.
-There's a lot of ground to cover.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.373
And she wants
to get into your life a little bit.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.958
Laura's a professional.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.669
She doesn't need two days to follow me.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.587
She could get that
in one afternoon at my place.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.549
-She just wants to do it justice.
-I appreciate that.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.342
And I will win Laura her Emmy.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.720
All eyes will be on
The Morning Show the next day,

05:03.804 --> 05:06.139
and I can do it
and still have time to make dinner.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.266
-Well, I'm sold.
-Great.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.643
Stella, you'll get on scheduling that
and call Laura?

05:09.726 --> 05:11.353
-Of course.
-Great. Thank you, guys.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.773
And I landed on someone to be my producer.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.149
Great. Who is it?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.359
Chip.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.654
Chip Black?

05:20.737 --> 05:24.157
Yeah. Look, Chip did not deserve
to be banished to the hinterlands.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.327
He was Fred's scapegoat
from a bogus investigation.

05:27.411 --> 05:31.623
And he was the best producer
I've ever had, and he's who I want.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.501
Stella, you'll get into that?

05:34.585 --> 05:35.878
Of course.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.921
Okay. Excellent.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.591
If there's anything else you need from me.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.800
Okay?

05:41.884 --> 05:44.428
And I'm so excited
for Monday's announcement.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.263
Really good, guys.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.352
Help me out here.
What are we considering big and special?

05:52.436 --> 05:54.563
I'll read you Mia's text.
"Need week to work.

05:54.646 --> 06:00.152
Alex back, sweeps, all eyes.
Not big and special equals not this week."

06:00.235 --> 06:01.945
-Where we at?
-All set for Thursday.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.447
Oh, fuck. That's great.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.076
Okay, before we get into it,
Alex just gave us some really big news.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.829
-Chip is coming back to produce for her.
-Yes!

06:10.913 --> 06:12.247
Does that seem right?

06:12.331 --> 06:14.833
-He was fired for no reason.
-Okay, listen.

06:14.917 --> 06:18.295
This network is going through
a lot of changes. Good change. Okay?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.715
I worked with Chip for a mighty long time.
All right.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.177
And let's just all get
on board with this. Okay?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.887
So you guys keep going with this.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.724
-I'll be back in a few minutes. Thank you.
-Hey, what happened with Daniel?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.894
Network is quarantining him.
Fourteen days. Beijing Hilton.

06:33.977 --> 06:34.978
-Sweet!
-Wow!

06:35.062 --> 06:37.356
We're all feeling fine so far,

06:37.439 --> 06:40.943
but we're only coming up
on our fifth day in this room.

06:41.026 --> 06:45.572
And we won't know for certain
that we're in the clear for another nine.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.951
Wow. It's tough to even imagine.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.371
So, there's over 50 million people
quarantined in China.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.581
Do they think
that's gonna stop the spread?

06:57.251 --> 07:01.338
They hope.
But the efficacy is still unknown.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.299
Public health experts and epidemiologists

07:04.383 --> 07:08.887
suggest that people exercise caution.
Social distancing.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.556
-What? What?
-Wait, what was that?

07:10.639 --> 07:12.432
"Social distancing"?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.853
I feel my family's been
social distancing for a long time.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.730
Hey, listen, Daniel, get home soon, okay?

07:18.814 --> 07:21.400
We'll check in with you tomorrow, Daniel.
Stay safe.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.278
-I--
-Truly extraordinary.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.445
Yes, it really is.

07:25.529 --> 07:29.575
And speaking of extraordinary,
we have hit the eight o'clock hour,

07:29.658 --> 07:31.201
and it is time.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.495
That's it. Ty, Alison, Yanko.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.664
-Get on down here.
-Here we go.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.291
Come on, join us.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.544
So unless you've been living under a rock,

07:40.627 --> 07:43.255
you know we've been promising
a really big announcement.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.967
And with me sadly bidding farewell
to the show in a couple of weeks,

07:47.676 --> 07:50.512
the big question everyone's been asking is

07:50.596 --> 07:53.724
who is going to be sitting here
with Bradley Jackson

07:53.807 --> 07:58.312
to help you start your day
at 7:00 a.m. on Monday, February 10th.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.981
And whoever you imagine it might be,
it is way better.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.566
Let's not keep the people waiting.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.902
-Let's do it.
-Okay. You talked me into it.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.573
Starting Monday, February 10th,
the person sitting to my right will be

08:09.656 --> 08:12.784
none other than the one, the only,
the incredible--

08:12.868 --> 08:15.454
-The living legend.
-The living legend, thank you, Ty.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.456
We cannot keep this secret
one second longer.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.501
Okay, okay… Alex Levy!

08:20.584 --> 08:22.377
Give me Alex Levy

08:22.461 --> 08:24.546
Give me Bradley Jackson too

08:26.840 --> 08:28.217
It's amazing!

08:31.261 --> 08:33.304
After the break, we will have details

08:33.388 --> 08:37.768
on Alex and Bradley week
here on UBA, the entire week

08:37.851 --> 08:40.938
before Alex reunites
with my friend right here.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.650
And just like Alex Levy,
we'll be right back.

08:44.733 --> 08:45.943
So fun.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.110
And we're clear.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.197
Two minutes, people. Let's clean up.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.533
Okay, the press release went out.

08:52.616 --> 08:55.494
All good reaction I see on Twitter,
and we're up 3% premarket.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.664
-So, congrats.
-You seem excited.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.208
-Yeah, I'm super excited.
-Lots of work left to do.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.003
Hey, great job, everyone.
Great job. Great job.

09:05.963 --> 09:09.049
Wow, you got me excited,
and I already knew the surprise.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.343
I wanna moderate the debate in Vegas.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.930
And would you say that that's indicative
of your moderating technique?

09:15.681 --> 09:16.807
I'm not joking.

09:19.434 --> 09:22.187
I appreciate that, but I'm gonna defer
to Stella on this one.

09:22.271 --> 09:25.607
-So now you defer to Stella?
-Do we need to talk?

09:25.691 --> 09:28.777
We are talking. These are my lips moving,
and they're making words.

09:28.861 --> 09:31.154
And the words are saying,
I'm not gonna get edged out

09:31.238 --> 09:34.449
just because you paid out the ass
for a piece of talent with a bigger name.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.494
-That's not happening at all.
-No, it's not. Not on my watch.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.162
This a broadcast network.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.457
And they need somebody
who people know is an independent thinker.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.503
Alex Levy will always be associated
with The Morning Show.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.340
But moving forward, whenever people think
about political coverage,

09:50.424 --> 09:51.800
I want them to think of me.

09:51.884 --> 09:55.387
Yeah, and everybody is going to see
Laura Peterson interviewing you

09:55.470 --> 09:57.639
in prime time while you cover
the Iowa caucus.

09:57.723 --> 09:58.765
That's politics.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.935
I hear you're having lunch
with Alex today.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.896
I am going to moderate that debate.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.941
Bradley, is your microphone on?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.944
-No.
-Good.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.406
'Cause I can't have you
talking to me this way

10:14.489 --> 10:16.909
in front of a studio full of my employees.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.661
Okay, people, clear.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.246
-Ten seconds, everybody.
-Good show.

10:21.830 --> 10:22.915
Nine.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.209
Eight.

10:25.918 --> 10:26.919
Seven.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.630
-Six.
-Can you take that? Thank you.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.257
So we have been
kicking around Italy for a while

10:32.341 --> 10:33.592
until Milan Fashion week.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.386
Geneva goes every year, as you know,
and now I get to join her.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.680
Geneva says
I get to look at all the pretty models,

10:38.764 --> 10:41.350
like haute couture are a major turn-on.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.645
If I wanted to see skinny teenagers
wearing nothing but two lampshades

10:44.728 --> 10:46.980
-and a serving spoon--
-Just shut the fuck up.

10:47.689 --> 10:51.485
What are you doing? What are we doing?
Is this what you wanted to discuss?

10:52.110 --> 10:55.739
-No, but we haven't talked in a while.
-Yeah, there's a reason for that.

10:55.822 --> 10:56.949
We both got nailed.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.201
What's the point in staying
mad at each other?

10:59.284 --> 11:02.120
Just say it.
Just say what you want to talk about.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.249
Let's be civil, Mitch.
We're on the same side. Co-defendants.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.752
-The same bullshit, cash-grab lawsuit.
-Yeah, that's what lawyers are for.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.796
I don't know how much
your lawyer's telling you,

11:10.879 --> 11:12.589
but we were generous trying to settle.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.716
Yeah. You're such a kind man.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.801
No, it's true.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.221
They have a stinker of a case.
Mitch, we didn't kill this poor girl.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.098
Neither did UBA.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.601
They should sue the guy
who sold her the fucking drugs.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.564
You have no guilt.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.483
Sympathy? Yeah.
Guilt? Not on your fucking life.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.821
All right. Well, let me ask you something.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.074
How stable was this girl
before she slept with you?

11:39.783 --> 11:42.786
You really think your dick is so powerful
that's what messed her up?

11:42.870 --> 11:44.037
This is not a joke.

11:44.121 --> 11:48.417
She was bright, and she was capable.
If she was unstable, she never showed it.

11:49.793 --> 11:54.298
There was one time
when she was a little out of sorts

11:54.381 --> 11:56.925
because we were covering a mass shooting.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.510
And I don't think it's fair…

11:59.511 --> 12:02.222
You know what? Fuck it.
I don't need to talk to you about it.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.975
Pout and wallow to your heart's content
if that's what you wanna do.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.853
But the point is,
we bear no legal responsibility.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.397
I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna shell out
tens of millions

12:10.480 --> 12:13.567
'cause I feel bad that some girl
couldn't handle herself in the real world.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.651
-She has a name.
-Yeah.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.197
And it's gonna get dragged through the mud
in the courts and press. For what?

12:20.157 --> 12:23.827
Now, look, the network is dragging
its feet on filing a motion to dismiss.

12:24.828 --> 12:28.332
We need to present a united front
and demand they do it.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.375
Leave me out of it.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.169
Mitch…

12:40.719 --> 12:43.805
Alex, how does it feel to be coming back
to The Morning Show?

12:43.889 --> 12:45.432
Wouldn't be there if it didn't feel great.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.809
-Is Trump gonna get impeached?
-He was impeached.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.353
-My friend's waiting.
-Alex!

12:50.771 --> 12:52.189
-It's Alex Levy!
-Hi.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.482
What? Oh, my God!

12:53.565 --> 12:55.192
Thanks, my dear.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.362
Okay.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.490
-Hello, hi.
-Hi.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.409
Hi.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.789
Hi.
This place is teeming with journalists.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.042
Don't worry about it.
It's not like we're having an affair.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.587
But I do wanna talk to you
about some things.

13:15.671 --> 13:19.508
I feel like we kind of
left on bad terms the other night.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.009
-I know.
-You know?

13:21.093 --> 13:24.429
I know, we really did.
I was thinking the exact same thing.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.598
Can I go first?

13:27.933 --> 13:29.476
-Sure.
-Okay.

13:29.560 --> 13:35.732
You know, I've been doing a lot of
reassessing over the last nine months.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.235
And I always believed in the golden rule.

13:39.653 --> 13:44.491
But I just think that my life became
so different than everyone else's,

13:44.575 --> 13:47.744
that I couldn't put myself
in other people's shoes.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.707
You know, I just lost touch.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.001
And I just want you to know
that I am trying.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.420
I really am, Bradley.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.381
And I heard every single thing
that you said.

14:00.257 --> 14:03.594
And so I--
And I also was just racking my brain

14:03.677 --> 14:06.054
trying to remember
what it was like when I started out.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.931
And if…

14:08.724 --> 14:12.477
if Mitch ever just left me
and didn't call…

14:14.688 --> 14:16.064
that would really hurt.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.067
I just want you to know
that I'm very sorry.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.990
Well, thank you for going there.

14:25.574 --> 14:26.575
Yeah.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.868
I appreciate that.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.745
I do.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.121
Yeah. Good.

14:32.331 --> 14:35.459
But just to be clear,
I'm still going to compete.

14:38.003 --> 14:41.215
So am I.
We're gonna make each other better.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.717
-Yeah, well, I like that.
-Yeah, I do too.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.385
But I wanted to--

14:45.469 --> 14:47.888
-Fuck. Fuck, fuck.
-What?

14:47.971 --> 14:50.057
Sorry,
Maggie Brener's walking to our table.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.476
-Who cares?
-Just let me do the talking, okay?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.062
-I can talk for myself, Alex.
-Maggie?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.271
-Alex.
-Hi.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.648
-Bradley.
-Hi.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.192
I guess even the dynamic duo needs to eat.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.237
Yes. I guess you saw our commercial.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.280
It was showing in my cab.

15:05.364 --> 15:07.157
It's very exciting, isn't it?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.953
-It is. Very exciting.
-It's very exciting.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.832
Well, it's good to see you both.
I will be watching February 10th.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.420
Oh, God, she bugs me.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.756
She seems perfectly nice.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.510
-Oh, Bradley.
-What does that even mean?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.555
Nothing. Listen, nothing.
Let's just order. Let's just order.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.390
Okay.

15:34.268 --> 15:35.394
Did you--

15:36.186 --> 15:38.647
Did you talk with her for her book?

15:40.232 --> 15:41.358
Yeah, I did.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.278
-Why wouldn't I?
-Just wondering.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.281
I didn't say anything bad about you.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.575
Let's hope not.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.912
Jesus, I didn't just start existing
the minute you saw me.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.706
I've been in this business for decades.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.251
I'm not gonna let some journalist wrangle
me into saying something I don't mean.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.379
I know. I know that you have been doing
this a long time.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.423
But you might not be used to

16:04.506 --> 16:06.925
the Maggie Breners
and the Laura Petersons of the world.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.010
Oh, my God, Alex.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.679
Will you please not poison my brain
about Laura Peterson

16:10.762 --> 16:12.556
before I even have an interview with her?

16:12.639 --> 16:16.059
I am not trying to poison your brain.
Bradley, why are you so dramatic?

16:17.936 --> 16:22.232
God. Okay, look, I've had a life,
and I've had experiences in that life.

16:22.316 --> 16:27.905
And some of those experiences
have included Laura Peterson, okay?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.907
Who I do not particularly trust,

16:29.990 --> 16:32.618
and I don't think
she particularly likes me.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.328
So I'm just trying to protect you.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.166
What in your mind
are you protecting me from?

16:39.249 --> 16:40.375
Okay, okay.

16:43.128 --> 16:46.465
I just think
we need to get our facts straight.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.092
We need to decide what the truth is.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.763
-Did you hear what you just said?
-I did. I heard what I said.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.516
Listen, there's been
so much drama and speculation

16:55.599 --> 16:57.142
about how you and I came together.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.770
And I just don't think
it's anybody's business but our own.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.104
No, I mean…

17:01.188 --> 17:03.482
Well, like, okay, for instance,
what are we going to say?

17:03.565 --> 17:06.108
What happened on my last day at work?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.612
That I was trying to get you fired

17:08.694 --> 17:11.906
because I found out that
you interviewed Mitch behind my back?

17:12.657 --> 17:13.700
That's a big one.

17:14.409 --> 17:18.704
Or that you interviewed Hannah
the day that she died?

17:22.376 --> 17:24.795
And do we really need people to know

17:24.877 --> 17:29.508
that I announced you as my co-anchor
on a whim to get back at the network?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.718
I don't know that--

17:31.802 --> 17:35.472
Right.
That's why we need to have this talk.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.851
And I don't have to tell anybody
how you got hired

17:38.934 --> 17:41.687
if you don't want people thinking
you were unqualified for the job.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.814
'Kay. Okay, I got it, yeah.

17:44.773 --> 17:45.774
Okay?

17:47.317 --> 17:48.402
Okay.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.905
Let's order.

17:53.282 --> 17:57.244
So, you're really against filing a motion
to dismiss with prejudice?

17:57.911 --> 18:02.332
Right. Well, it might be cleaner
for us to keep this under our control

18:02.416 --> 18:04.251
so we can settle it appropriately.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.462
Fred's name is always going to be
associated with UBA.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.299
I don't think it does any good
to have it all over the papers.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.845
Yeah? Sorry, I told them to interrupt
at 4:00. Come in.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.347
We closed down 1%.

18:17.931 --> 18:22.644
The Dow and S&P were both down 1.6%,
so 1% is kind of a positive.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.440
Thanks.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.567
I like the optimism.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.319
Happy days are here again.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.782
Hey. So, who's out there?

18:36.617 --> 18:39.661
Cory, Mia, Stella, Teresa…

18:39.745 --> 18:41.496
-A lot of ring kissing.
-Hey.

18:41.580 --> 18:45.167
-Hi, thank you.
-See? People are excited, you know?

18:45.250 --> 18:49.922
Lots of people looking to get
some rub off of UBA News's big stars.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.257
You should get out there.
Greet everybody.

18:53.634 --> 18:55.594
I will. Are we done?
We're pretty done, right?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.513
-You look great.
-Thank you.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.349
-Is Laura out there yet?
-I don't think so.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.810
Well,
then what am I running out there for?

19:05.979 --> 19:06.980
Okay.

19:17.616 --> 19:19.576
-I know that move.
-What?

19:20.786 --> 19:24.748
Can we just--
Let's get off on the right foot, you know?

19:24.831 --> 19:28.460
Let's not do anything
that could be looked at as diva-like, or--

19:28.544 --> 19:31.672
Honey, listen, if you want to go out there
and keep everyone entertained

19:31.755 --> 19:34.258
while Laura gets her touch-ups,
go right ahead.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.592
Then just come and get me.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.555
You know?

19:40.222 --> 19:41.223
Right. Yeah.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.767
Go out fighting for her.

19:44.268 --> 19:47.312
It's funny 'cause, you know,
my deal still isn't closed yet.

19:47.396 --> 19:50.148
-Oh, boy. Oh, gosh.
-Maybe I shouldn't even be here right now.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.734
Waiting any longer isn't gonna make it
any easier.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.948
Thank you for helping get this together.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.993
Hope we can get something
worthwhile in the time you gave us.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.370
We just have Alex's schedule
packed so tight

20:03.453 --> 20:04.955
since she's coming back in 13 days.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.250
Laura is such an important part
of the UBA family.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.878
We're just so grateful
she made the time to do the special.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.504
Excuse me. One second.

20:13.922 --> 20:18.302
Charlie Black. You're back.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.220
Charlie Black is back.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.848
Please, you know my friends call me Chip.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.601
So that's the right thing
you called me, actually.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.145
God da-- Come on, don't do me like that.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.355
You know I'm kidding. Mostly.

20:32.983 --> 20:36.403
-Chip. Here comes trouble.
-Mia!

20:37.613 --> 20:38.655
Okay.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.367
The show is so great. So great.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.703
Gordon, long time no see.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.915
I hear you've been keeping busy.
Glad you were able to get back.

20:47.998 --> 20:51.877
Allow me to introduce
my very worthy replacement, Stella Bak.

20:52.461 --> 20:53.837
Stella, it's great to meet you.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.839
-Look forward to working together.
-Oh, yeah.

20:55.923 --> 20:58.175
Thanks so much. Should be good.

21:01.303 --> 21:06.391
Okay. I'm gonna go
check to see if Alex is ready. Okay.

21:06.475 --> 21:07.726
-All right.
-Okay.

21:09.186 --> 21:10.187
Excuse me.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.777
Miss Laura Peterson, I presume.

21:17.903 --> 21:22.115
Lord Cory of Ellison.
You put the CE in CEO.

21:22.908 --> 21:27.204
And you put the L into LGBTQ.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.250
UBA365 is still kicking ass.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.253
Imagine what it would be
if you came back full-time.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.713
I put almost 20 years into that show.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.007
I'm ready to be the absentee parent.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.844
My mother did it so gracefully herself.

21:43.095 --> 21:46.265
So only four hours,
and she's late for that.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.933
Well, you know Alex.

21:48.016 --> 21:51.937
But you're a genius, and you're gonna get
God's fucking nectar in these four hours.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.981
Well, from your lips to God's nectar.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.567
Yeah, I do have a favor to ask you.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.068
Another favor?

21:58.569 --> 22:03.323
Well, it is part of the same favor.
Well, tangentially related, in any case.

22:04.533 --> 22:08.203
You're gonna spend, I don't know,
maybe 36, 48 hours with Bradley in Iowa.

22:08.287 --> 22:10.539
Yeah, that's like seven lifetimes in Iowa.

22:10.622 --> 22:13.750
Yeah. Now, see, that's more
than enough time for you to maybe,

22:13.834 --> 22:14.835
I don't know…

22:16.420 --> 22:18.338
coach her a little bit.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.551
You mean…

22:22.634 --> 22:26.555
reporting on sweatshops through a scowl
is not exactly "Morning Show"?

22:26.638 --> 22:28.599
I didn't say that,
and you didn't hear me say that.

22:28.682 --> 22:32.102
You might have seen me think it.
Listen, to be fair,

22:32.186 --> 22:33.937
she got thrown into the deep end.

22:34.021 --> 22:39.610
You had the luxury of watching
Blair Todman up close for all those years.

22:39.693 --> 22:43.197
Absorbing all that knowledge and skill
before you became an anchor.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.158
Would you have been able to do the job
that you did at YDA

22:46.241 --> 22:47.534
if you'd been thrown right in?

22:48.368 --> 22:51.246
Well, that turned out well, didn't it?

22:51.330 --> 22:52.915
Well, that's a different story.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.335
You're already going to Iowa with her.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.630
Just take a look at her, please.

22:59.713 --> 23:03.759
And maybe gently, gently offer
a little bit of guidance.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.137
Well, look who's here.

23:07.763 --> 23:08.805
We gotta get going.

23:12.017 --> 23:13.936
-There she is.
-Here I am.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.145
Hi, Alex.

23:15.229 --> 23:16.480
Hi, honey.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.316
-How's Lizzy? Is she here?
-Oh, God, no.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.985
She doesn't hang out
for this sort of stuff anymore.

23:23.237 --> 23:24.905
Cory, I can see you.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.282
-Get over here.
-Hot dog.

23:27.950 --> 23:30.077
Stella, you too, come on. Come in.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.500
Okay, enough of that already.
Alex, if you're ready, you're over here.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.794
I'm gonna grab a water.
I'll be right there.

23:43.549 --> 23:47.511
-Thank you.
-Okay, everybody, I'm ready.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.514
Everybody who doesn't need to be here,
don't be here.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.267
We've got three hours and 37 minutes
to get this thing.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.518
Plenty.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.228
-You good? Okay.
-I'm great.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.150
What?

24:02.234 --> 24:04.611
I don't think it was a good idea
to bring Chip back.

24:04.695 --> 24:07.614
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but we need to talk to Alex.

24:07.698 --> 24:11.285
Okay, when we're not in a tailspin,
then you can practice your loop the loops.

24:11.368 --> 24:13.537
Right now, you need Alex to land
as much as I do.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.664
I'm not doing loop the loops.

24:17.499 --> 24:22.171
And by the way, it's not like I wanna
just go around not approving of shit.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.256
I just actually care about things.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.717
I want to approve of things.
I want to build things,

24:26.800 --> 24:29.553
but I can't build them
if the ground isn't level.

24:36.435 --> 24:37.519
I hear you.

24:39.229 --> 24:40.230
I do.

24:41.148 --> 24:44.902
And the thing that's gonna give us
the power to make those changes…

24:46.737 --> 24:48.197
success.

24:49.823 --> 24:50.991
Right now,

24:51.074 --> 24:56.705
we need to keep Alex happy
so she can be successful, right?

25:07.049 --> 25:10.636
So, are you sick and tired of people
yelling Paddy Chayefsky lines at you?

25:10.719 --> 25:13.013
"I'm mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take it anymore."

25:13.096 --> 25:16.225
Yeah, I know.
I mean, I'd rather they say, "Hey, Alex."

25:16.308 --> 25:20.646
But, you know, I'm just happy
that it meant so much to so many.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.273
You yourself that day even said

25:23.357 --> 25:26.068
that you had been part of the problem.

25:26.902 --> 25:30.781
So if you today
could talk to you 15 years ago,

25:30.864 --> 25:32.324
what would you tell yourself?

25:34.409 --> 25:37.788
Well, I would first say, "You're not going
to believe who's president."

25:40.290 --> 25:41.291
Mind blown.

25:41.375 --> 25:43.085
And then after I said that,

25:43.168 --> 25:44.920
I think I would have said…

25:46.338 --> 25:47.840
"Success is not the endgame."

25:49.508 --> 25:52.427
It's not even the game necessarily.

25:53.679 --> 25:56.557
But I think we've all woken up
to what was happening--

25:56.640 --> 25:58.267
Well, I should just speak for myself.

25:59.184 --> 26:03.397
When I was worried about my own success.

26:06.233 --> 26:09.945
Well, the network has made
sweeping changes since that day.

26:10.904 --> 26:14.032
Do you feel like
the important things have been addressed?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.243
I do. I do.

26:16.326 --> 26:22.165
I mean, we're all trying, you know?
It's an imperfect science.

26:22.833 --> 26:25.919
But we're all feeling our way
through the dark,

26:26.003 --> 26:30.007
and I just know that it will never go back
to the way that it was.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.635
No one should feel unsafe
in the workplace.

26:35.095 --> 26:39.850
I know that a beloved member
of the TMS family passed away

26:39.933 --> 26:42.060
the morning of your great awakening.

26:45.564 --> 26:48.108
I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable
talking about that.

26:48.692 --> 26:52.029
This was someone who valued her privacy.
So I'd like to respect that.

26:52.112 --> 26:55.532
-Of course. Absolutely. Not a problem.
-Okay, thank you.

26:57.993 --> 27:03.040
So there has been a lot written
about the way things were at UBA,

27:03.123 --> 27:05.626
including the forthcoming book
by Maggie Brener.

27:07.252 --> 27:09.880
She provided me with
an excerpt from her book, and

27:09.963 --> 27:15.469
it provides some fascinating insight into
the world of The Morning Show back then.

27:16.178 --> 27:19.681
She tells the story of a show
and a network

27:19.765 --> 27:23.393
that was rife with sexism and ageism,

27:23.477 --> 27:25.729
of Machiavellian scheming,

27:25.812 --> 27:31.527
of a lust for ratings that allowed even
the worst behavior to be permissible.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.947
Does that line up with your experience?

27:37.407 --> 27:38.534
To some degree, yes.

27:46.792 --> 27:51.296
What was the nature of your relationship
with Mitch Kessler?

28:03.851 --> 28:05.227
He was my best friend.

28:06.353 --> 28:07.688
He was my best friend.

28:09.731 --> 28:15.654
But Mitch could be many things
to a lot of people, clearly.

28:17.322 --> 28:20.033
-And do you still talk to him?
-No, I do not.

28:22.703 --> 28:26.248
They would hire
a documentary filmmaker to,

28:26.331 --> 28:29.126
you know, to do pieces in a news magazine.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.920
Is that what you consider yourself?
A documentarian?

28:32.004 --> 28:33.463
Primarily, yes.

28:33.547 --> 28:36.091
But I would like more consistency
in my life.

28:36.884 --> 28:39.011
-Hard deadlines.
-Yeah, I get that.

28:39.845 --> 28:43.223
I could see if there's someone
that I could send some of your work to.

28:44.975 --> 28:46.935
-Are you gonna get that?
-No, it's--

28:47.019 --> 28:51.023
There's an old colleague who showed up,
and he's been texting me incessantly.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.316
Not a thing.

28:53.525 --> 28:54.776
Maybe it's your kids.

28:56.653 --> 28:57.654
Okay.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.584
-I'm going to go.
-It's--

29:12.002 --> 29:14.338
-What? You're leaving?
-Yes, I am.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.549
No, please. Don't take my-- Okay.

29:17.633 --> 29:19.593
-Don't take my phone.
-Just don't.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.553
You don't want me to scream, do you?

29:24.056 --> 29:26.892
Sorry.
But that's what you got upset about?

29:26.975 --> 29:28.101
Yes.

29:28.769 --> 29:31.104
You should feel pity for her.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.566
Choosing to live in her past.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.026
You have a chance to move on.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.486
I have moved on.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.030
This was an important part of my life.

29:40.113 --> 29:43.325
-You know, it just--
-Poor you.

29:43.408 --> 29:46.995
You're never going to outrun the sadness,
so get some fucking balls.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.997
-Okay. Yeah, that's what I'll do.
-Yes.

29:49.081 --> 29:51.750
I mean, you don't need
the world to forgive you

29:51.834 --> 29:53.919
to do something useful with your brain.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.173
I mean, don't you want to use it
before it's worm food?

29:58.257 --> 30:02.302
Before some sparrow eats it
and your brain is sparrow shit?

30:02.386 --> 30:03.846
Okay, that's horrible. Thank you.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.764
I know it's horrible.
The truth is horrible.

30:05.848 --> 30:08.350
This has been a joy.
This whole thing has just been a joy.

30:08.433 --> 30:09.935
-That's what we do…
-Thank you so much…

30:10.018 --> 30:12.271
-…we expose horrible truths.
-…for this wonderful meeting.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.940
No. No, that's what I did.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.942
Actually, that's not what I did.

30:17.025 --> 30:21.321
What I did was playact
exposing horrible truths.

30:21.405 --> 30:25.450
Listen, you can only look ahead.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.662
You cannot undo what you did.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.123
But you could do
good things for the world.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.374
You can help people.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.293
Nobody wants my help.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.044
Yes, I could use your help.

30:36.795 --> 30:38.839
I want you to do a documentary with me.

30:39.423 --> 30:41.633
Do you want to hear what it is about?

30:42.801 --> 30:43.927
Seriously.

30:44.928 --> 30:49.349
An appeals court in Italy
overturn a rape conviction

30:49.433 --> 30:54.104
-because the defendant said…
-I'm not in a position--

30:54.188 --> 30:57.524
…the victim was too ugly to be raped.

30:57.608 --> 31:01.820
Good luck with that.
Really. I wish you the very best.

31:01.904 --> 31:04.198
-No, it's okay.
-Drinks are on me.

31:09.453 --> 31:10.537
Have a good one.

31:10.621 --> 31:13.415
-Thanks, you guys! Bye.
-Thank you, you too.

31:22.508 --> 31:23.675
What the fuck was that?

31:24.635 --> 31:25.928
To be clear,

31:26.011 --> 31:28.931
which "what the fuck was that"
are we talking about?

31:29.014 --> 31:31.266
"What is the nature
of your relationship with Mitch?"

31:31.350 --> 31:33.185
That's what the fuck I'm talking about.

31:33.268 --> 31:35.896
-Could mean a lot of different things.
-Don't be an asshole, Chip.

31:35.979 --> 31:38.398
You knew exactly what it meant,
and it was completely inappropriate.

31:38.482 --> 31:40.359
I thought you handled it really well.

31:40.442 --> 31:44.238
Of course I did. That's not the point.

31:44.321 --> 31:46.782
That was an accusation.

31:47.407 --> 31:49.076
It was not a question.

31:49.576 --> 31:51.370
It should not have been in that interview

31:51.453 --> 31:53.622
that is going to air
on national television.

31:54.498 --> 31:58.377
-From someone that works at our network.
-Okay, you're right. You're right.

31:58.460 --> 31:59.461
Yeah.

32:00.254 --> 32:02.631
-How could you approve that question?
-I didn't, okay?

32:02.714 --> 32:06.134
The question I approved was more,
"How was your relationship with Mitch?"

32:06.218 --> 32:07.344
There was no "nature of,"

32:07.427 --> 32:09.221
and there was no
discussion of Maggie's book.

32:09.304 --> 32:10.305
Jesus!

32:10.931 --> 32:13.600
-How do you let that get past you?
-I'm not a goalie.

32:13.684 --> 32:17.062
What do you want me to do?
Am I supposed to waterboard Gordon here?

32:17.145 --> 32:19.356
What is this, okay?

32:19.439 --> 32:22.943
Look, I can't imagine
the network's gonna use it anyway.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.528
I don't wanna take that risk.

32:26.238 --> 32:29.575
Look, I really think
you might be overreacting a little--

32:30.409 --> 32:32.160
Well, I'm just saying, you know,

32:32.244 --> 32:34.830
we got a lot of shit to do
before the 10th.

32:34.913 --> 32:37.624
We don't need to be worrying about
stuff like this.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.042
Honestly, all right?

32:39.626 --> 32:42.713
It's all bullshit anyway, right?

32:45.090 --> 32:47.634
No, I'm not asking.
I'm saying it's all bullshit,

32:47.718 --> 32:49.094
so we don't have to worry.

32:51.722 --> 32:53.390
Hey. All right.

32:53.473 --> 32:57.060
I'm clearly not doing a good job at this.
Try not to worry, okay?

32:57.644 --> 32:59.438
You have your book coming out.

32:59.521 --> 33:00.898
It's going to be great.

33:00.981 --> 33:04.318
You are going to tell this story
exactly how it happened,

33:04.401 --> 33:05.694
straight from the source.

33:05.777 --> 33:06.945
Straight from the source.

33:07.029 --> 33:08.906
I know you're still working
Mitch's chapter,

33:08.989 --> 33:10.532
and it's hard, but you'll find it.

33:10.616 --> 33:14.328
If you do want someone to read your book,
no pressure, but, you know,

33:14.411 --> 33:16.496
-if you'd like some input from a friend--
-So nice.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.415
I actually just finished up notes on that.

33:18.498 --> 33:24.004
-I'd love you to read it when I'm done.
-All right. You gotta get some sleep.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.924
Big day tomorrow. 8:00 a.m.?

33:27.007 --> 33:28.258
Okay, ticktock.

33:28.342 --> 33:30.302
Ticktock. We don't stop.

33:30.385 --> 33:31.386
Good job today.

33:31.470 --> 33:32.596
Thank you.

33:41.313 --> 33:44.650
I'm talking about Punxsutawney Phil
from Punxsutawney, PA,

33:44.733 --> 33:47.194
because today is Groundhog Day.

33:47.277 --> 33:48.570
Hey, pop quiz, Ty.

33:48.654 --> 33:51.114
What does it mean
when Phil sees his shadow?

33:51.198 --> 33:52.699
It means six more weeks of winter.

33:52.783 --> 33:55.202
So, did Phil see his shadow today,

33:55.285 --> 33:58.872
or can we all please just hang our
winter coats in the back of the closet?

34:00.624 --> 34:03.710
Ladies and gentlemen, Punxsutawney Phil.

34:03.794 --> 34:07.297
And so, ye faithful, there is no shadow.

34:07.381 --> 34:08.715
He did not see his shadow!

34:08.799 --> 34:11.426
Come on, early spring it is.

34:11.510 --> 34:15.179
Listen, you can keep your bears
and your monkeys and your tigers

34:15.264 --> 34:18.516
because, at least for today,
the groundhog is truly my spirit animal.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.812
And I think for anyone who's sick
and tired of shoveling their front walk,

34:21.895 --> 34:24.565
the groundhog is their spirit animal too.

34:25.274 --> 34:26.900
We'll be right back.

34:26.984 --> 34:28.402
And we're out.

34:29.319 --> 34:31.737
Be sure to tune in to UBA365

34:31.822 --> 34:35.617
for a very special interview
with Alex Levy and Bradley Jackson,

34:35.701 --> 34:38.328
as they team up once again
to help you start your day.

34:38.411 --> 34:41.706
Hosted by Laura Peterson.
Sunday night at UBA.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.091
Hey, I'm about to
get on a plane. What's going on?

34:51.175 --> 34:52.426
Yeah, I know.

34:52.509 --> 34:56.096
Look, I have to tell you something
you need to know before it's too late.

34:56.597 --> 34:58.682
Okay, Alex, I asked you not to do this.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.560
-I'm not doing anything.
-What? What is it? What is so important?

35:01.643 --> 35:04.104
This is not the puff piece
you think it is. All right?

35:04.188 --> 35:07.149
She has her own agenda, Bradley.
She crossed a line with me.

35:07.232 --> 35:08.400
What do you mean?

35:08.483 --> 35:11.904
She asked-- I mean,
she phrased it in a way to suggest

35:11.987 --> 35:15.240
if I had ever had
a sexual relationship with Mitch.

35:16.158 --> 35:19.036
Wait, what? Why would she ask that?

35:19.703 --> 35:21.580
Because she's not a very nice person.

35:21.663 --> 35:24.666
I don't know what
motivates these people. All right?

35:24.750 --> 35:27.961
So you need to be on your guard. Okay?

35:29.296 --> 35:32.549
And for your information, I did not.

35:32.633 --> 35:35.177
-I did not.
-Yeah, I wouldn't assume.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.471
Okay, thank you. Bye.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.139
Bye.

35:40.891 --> 35:43.560
Right on time. Everybody's set up.

35:44.770 --> 35:45.979
Yeah, okay.

35:49.942 --> 35:52.444
So, how you get
a hundred New Yorkers out of a pool?

35:52.528 --> 35:53.529
"Fuck you."

35:53.612 --> 35:56.073
How do you get
a hundred Canadians out of the pool?

35:56.156 --> 35:59.326
-Just ask.
-Oh, my God, okay. What is the--

35:59.409 --> 36:01.537
-Never heard that one before.
-It's a good one.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.667
Well, if it isn't Bradley Jackson.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.128
Yep, that's me.
I've heard so much about you.

36:10.963 --> 36:14.550
-Only good things, I hope.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. All good.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.845
Well, welcome. Come on in.

36:18.595 --> 36:19.596
Hi.

36:28.021 --> 36:30.023
-Okay. Thanks.
-Well?

36:30.107 --> 36:32.526
Please tell me
if they're coming to me this segment.

36:33.402 --> 36:34.611
No go.

36:34.695 --> 36:37.781
What? No go? They're bumping me?

36:37.865 --> 36:41.285
They apologized. They're running long.
But we'll try it again tomorrow.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.662
In the meantime,
we're on UBANC in a couple of hours.

36:43.745 --> 36:46.748
What's so important
that they're bumping me from my own show?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.377
I'm here with Professor Marcus Debs,

36:50.460 --> 36:54.256
chair of the poli-sci department
at the University of Iowa

36:54.339 --> 36:56.758
to help me break down
what will happen tonight

36:56.842 --> 36:59.845
here at one of the many caucus sites.

36:59.928 --> 37:02.222
The gymnasium is just starting to set up…

37:02.306 --> 37:03.307
Oh, God.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.517
…the room is already electric.

37:05.601 --> 37:08.729
Professor, how many people
do you expect to show up tonight?

37:08.812 --> 37:10.480
This is your first caucus?

37:11.023 --> 37:14.610
The West Virginia primary was,
you know, the only one I've ever been to.

37:14.693 --> 37:15.694
Never a caucus.

37:16.528 --> 37:20.908
This was
suddenly a big leap for you, right?

37:20.991 --> 37:26.205
Well, going from reporter in West Virginia
to covering a national election

37:26.288 --> 37:29.708
for the most storied morning news show
in TV history.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.211
Yeah, I know it seems like a big leap,

37:32.294 --> 37:35.380
but I've been working towards this
for a really long time.

37:35.464 --> 37:37.841
A lot has been made about that big leap.

37:37.925 --> 37:42.304
About how exactly it happened
with no one seeing it coming.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.516
I mean, there's been
a lot of ink spilled on the subject.

37:45.599 --> 37:46.600
Yeah.

37:46.683 --> 37:51.313
But there's something
that's fascinating to me

37:51.396 --> 37:55.359
that no one's ever touched upon in full.

37:58.904 --> 38:00.864
What does it feel like?

38:01.782 --> 38:06.453
You know, to be at this stage
in your career at this point in your life.

38:06.537 --> 38:07.871
I mean, by your own admission,

38:07.955 --> 38:11.041
you were toiling in small stations
around the country.

38:11.124 --> 38:12.125
Right. Right.

38:12.209 --> 38:16.213
And to suddenly be given this opportunity

38:16.296 --> 38:19.216
that must have seemed like
it would never come,

38:20.133 --> 38:21.593
how does that feel?

38:23.136 --> 38:26.515
You know… I grew up thinking

38:26.598 --> 38:29.977
that there weren't necessarily gonna be
a lot of possibilities for me.

38:30.060 --> 38:33.188
There just were gonna be
certain doors that would never be open.

38:33.272 --> 38:35.482
But then I found
this thing that I'm good at,

38:35.566 --> 38:40.070
and it seemed like
I could have these big dreams, you know?

38:40.821 --> 38:43.532
And then life happens, you know.
Stuff happens.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.576
And I got to this point

38:45.659 --> 38:49.997
where I thought this level of success
was just not possible for me.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.456
I just wasn't gonna achieve it.

38:51.540 --> 38:55.335
And I convinced myself, actually…

38:57.379 --> 38:59.464
I guess I convinced myself
that I didn't really want it.

39:01.133 --> 39:04.970
And that was a handful
of pretty tough years for me.

39:05.554 --> 39:08.682
And I did that a long time.

39:09.683 --> 39:12.561
And really up until everything happened
about a month ago.

39:13.187 --> 39:16.648
And how did this month
change things for you?

39:17.357 --> 39:18.358
This month?

39:20.194 --> 39:21.945
I was in a place where I felt like

39:22.029 --> 39:24.990
I had control over my life,
control over my destiny.

39:25.073 --> 39:29.661
And then, like that, I realized--
I feared…

39:29.745 --> 39:32.998
I just-- I thought,
I don't have any control at all.

39:34.416 --> 39:38.128
And so then I did something rash,
and I acted out.

39:38.879 --> 39:41.215
And every day that passed,

39:42.049 --> 39:44.134
I thought to myself,
"What if I lose this?"

39:44.635 --> 39:48.889
It took me so long to get here.
What if I never get back?

39:48.972 --> 39:50.182
Right.

39:50.265 --> 39:51.558
And then I realized, like--

39:52.809 --> 39:55.229
Once I realized how I felt,

39:55.312 --> 39:57.898
that's when I realized
what this job means to me.

40:03.654 --> 40:04.738
Oh, shit.

40:04.821 --> 40:07.908
That how you throw your coffee out now?
Just drop it wherever you stand?

40:07.991 --> 40:11.703
-No. I swear. I just-- I'm picking it up.
-No.

40:11.787 --> 40:14.623
-I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot.
-Because I called you on it.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.458
-I'm gonna get you another cup.
-I'm gonna get you new shoes.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.460
I don't need new shoes.
I like coffee-stained shoes.

40:18.544 --> 40:20.087
I can't afford
your beautiful shoes anyway.

40:25.259 --> 40:28.428
-What time is it there?
-Where I am time has no meaning.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.306
2:36 in the morning.

40:31.890 --> 40:34.560
Clearly my time is meaningless to you.

40:34.643 --> 40:39.690
You sent me nine million miles away
to the epicenter of a viral outbreak

40:39.773 --> 40:45.028
which I now have to wait 14 days
in this godforsaken hotel.

40:45.112 --> 40:46.905
Hilton is not godforsaken.

40:46.989 --> 40:48.657
It's godforsaken.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.743
Hey. Hey, how are you?
Could you please put Daniel on the phone?

40:51.827 --> 40:53.161
You bumped me.

40:53.245 --> 40:55.581
We're in the middle of
the third impeachment in US history.

40:55.664 --> 40:56.665
The caucus is today.

40:56.748 --> 41:00.419
Shaq was on to talk about Kobe Bryant.
This stuff is a big deal.

41:01.336 --> 41:03.964
-This is a big deal.
-And you said it yourself.

41:04.047 --> 41:06.133
You're on the other side of the globe.
We don't even air there.

41:06.216 --> 41:08.844
I can hear TVs turning off in Wyoming.

41:08.927 --> 41:10.721
People need to know what's coming.

41:10.804 --> 41:13.473
News isn't just the stuff you wanna hear.

41:13.557 --> 41:16.602
Listen, you're 13 hours ahead,
and it might be news there.

41:16.685 --> 41:19.062
I'm telling you,
I'm walking around midtown Manhattan.

41:19.146 --> 41:23.942
There's a million people on the street.
It is not impacting everyday life here.

41:24.026 --> 41:25.944
And, you know,
Alex is coming back in a week,

41:26.028 --> 41:27.988
and I need a home run, dude.

41:28.614 --> 41:29.907
Shit, I need ratings,

41:29.990 --> 41:31.491
you know, Daniel?

41:34.286 --> 41:35.287
Daniel?

41:38.624 --> 41:39.791
I can hear you breathing.

41:41.376 --> 41:43.420
Goddamn it. Daniel.

41:44.755 --> 41:47.841
My life can't be all about making
everything okay for you in every moment.

41:47.925 --> 41:50.344
Will you do something for me for once
and be a fucking man?

41:52.137 --> 41:53.138
Fuck you.

41:57.434 --> 41:58.435
Fuck.

41:58.519 --> 41:59.686
Yanko?

41:59.770 --> 42:03.023
Apparently, it's not good to say
something is your spirit animal anymore.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.816
-It isn't?
-Christ, something else?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.027
I didn't say anything offensive.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.446
That's so stupid.
But thanks for the heads up, Zoomer.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.785
-Hey.
-Hey, Chip.

42:16.787 --> 42:19.373
Oh, my God, Chip!

42:19.456 --> 42:21.834
Oh, my God, you. You're so pregnant.

42:22.501 --> 42:25.045
They said you were just making
that up to get attention.

42:25.128 --> 42:28.423
No, my life just felt empty
without a baby to take care of.

42:28.507 --> 42:30.008
I'm the baby.

42:30.092 --> 42:31.343
Yep. I get it.

42:33.136 --> 42:35.514
-Layla. Hi.
-Hey, Chip.

42:35.597 --> 42:37.099
It's great to see you.

42:40.310 --> 42:42.312
Do not take that personally.

42:43.021 --> 42:46.400
It's just that there are some people here

42:46.483 --> 42:48.694
that don't think they should've
brought you back.

42:48.777 --> 42:50.404
-I see.
-But they'll get over it.

42:50.487 --> 42:51.947
They just need some time.

42:52.948 --> 42:56.451
No, it's okay.
I understand. Not a problem.

42:56.535 --> 42:59.121
You don't have to
take care of me anymore, remember?

42:59.204 --> 43:03.834
I just wanted to see you and say hi.

43:03.917 --> 43:05.794
It's good to see you. And good to see you.

43:05.878 --> 43:07.087
You too.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.506
-Okay.
-Okay.

43:09.590 --> 43:11.842
-You look great.
-Thank you.

43:14.011 --> 43:17.347
What was the nature
of your relationship with Mitch Kessler?

43:26.607 --> 43:27.900
He was my best friend.

43:28.859 --> 43:30.444
He was my best friend.

43:33.071 --> 43:35.699
-But--
-I'm sorry, can you rewind that, please?

43:35.782 --> 43:36.825
Mitch was…

43:41.121 --> 43:42.539
I didn't approve this question.

43:42.623 --> 43:44.917
So let's see if we can
tighten this up a little.

43:45.584 --> 43:49.922
What was the nature
of your relationship with Mitch Kessler?

43:50.005 --> 43:52.382
Yes, Noorean. I just spoke to
someone at the DNC

43:52.466 --> 43:55.719
that said there will not be
final results tonight.

43:55.802 --> 43:59.389
As you said, this is not the start
that the Democrats were hoping

43:59.473 --> 44:02.643
for the primary season,
but tomorrow is another day.

44:02.726 --> 44:06.313
And if they can't get it sorted out,
maybe they'll call the whole thing off.

44:06.396 --> 44:09.525
Well, I guess we'll see.
Thanks, Bradley. Really good stuff.

44:09.608 --> 44:11.068
Thank you, Noorean.

44:11.151 --> 44:12.694
After the break, we'll be talking to

44:12.778 --> 44:15.572
Senator Elizabeth Warren's
campaign manager, Roger Lau.

44:15.656 --> 44:18.075
-Okay.
-We'll get the campaign's reactions.

44:18.659 --> 44:19.660
Stay with us.

44:35.050 --> 44:36.260
Everybody going to bed?

44:36.343 --> 44:38.512
I don't know. I'm not sleepy.
I know I should be.

44:38.595 --> 44:40.848
-I'm tired, but I'm not sleepy.
-Thank you.

44:40.931 --> 44:43.600
I am both tired and sleepy,
so yeah, I'm going to bed.

44:43.684 --> 44:45.686
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night!

44:45.769 --> 44:46.770
Night.

44:47.271 --> 44:48.397
So?

44:48.480 --> 44:51.191
Was the caucus everything
you thought it would be and more?

44:51.275 --> 44:54.319
Well, in terms of there was no results,

44:54.403 --> 44:55.654
-I don't know.
-Yeah, I know.

44:55.737 --> 44:57.406
-What the fuck happened?
-I don't know.

44:57.489 --> 45:01.743
Well, on the bright side,
there's only 49 more of these things.

45:01.827 --> 45:03.036
Oh, no.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.622
-So, Cory…
-Yeah?

45:05.706 --> 45:07.124
…who I love, by the way.

45:07.624 --> 45:09.376
But he asked me to look after you.

45:11.253 --> 45:14.006
Okay. Wait. Mentor me?

45:14.089 --> 45:18.135
Oh, no. Well, the word "mentor"
was never uttered, but… yeah.

45:18.760 --> 45:22.723
I mean, it came from a good place,
and I probably shouldn't have told you.

45:23.849 --> 45:27.769
But after watching you all day,
I don't think you need it.

45:27.853 --> 45:30.063
Did you think I needed it
before you watched me?

45:30.147 --> 45:31.440
Well, that's not the point.

45:31.523 --> 45:35.027
The point is that you surprised me
in a good way.

45:35.110 --> 45:39.114
-I did?
-Yeah. You were a dynamo out there.

45:40.324 --> 45:43.702
I mean, it's a side of you
I've never seen on TMS.

45:44.328 --> 45:47.289
You're fun. Do they know that you're fun?

45:47.998 --> 45:51.251
Well, I used to be fun.
That's how I got pregnant when I was 15.

45:51.793 --> 45:54.087
That doesn't sound like much fun to me,

45:54.171 --> 45:56.423
but probably just a matter of taste.

45:56.507 --> 46:00.594
Point is… I don't think
they're using you in the right way.

46:01.345 --> 46:02.513
Really?

46:02.596 --> 46:06.725
You know, the people who stay
on The Morning Show forever

46:06.808 --> 46:10.103
are kind of the people
who can't do anything else.

46:11.855 --> 46:13.315
You're bigger than that.

46:17.027 --> 46:19.863
-Thank you. I really appreciate that.
-You're welcome.

46:21.990 --> 46:23.825
Wow, Laura Peterson.

46:29.623 --> 46:33.627
I have to be honest,
I was kinda surprised by you too.

46:33.710 --> 46:35.838
Let me guess, Alex got in your ear.

46:35.921 --> 46:37.548
I'm right, right?

46:38.131 --> 46:40.551
We talk.

46:42.469 --> 46:45.472
-We're partners, you know?
-No. Of course. Nothing wrong with it.

46:45.556 --> 46:47.015
How is that, really?

46:48.350 --> 46:53.897
Am I sensing a tone of voice?
I think there might be a tone of voice.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.941
Yeah, well,
when you know someone long enough,

46:56.024 --> 46:57.860
there's bound to be a tone of voice.

46:57.943 --> 47:02.197
-Jesus, it's freezing out here.
-I know. Okay, let's go inside.

47:34.730 --> 47:36.023
God.

47:53.832 --> 47:57.669
So, do you think you got everything
you needed for the interview?

47:57.753 --> 48:01.298
Oh, yeah. I got plenty. I could have left
before we went inside yesterday,

48:01.381 --> 48:03.050
but I was having too much fun.

48:03.759 --> 48:04.760
Hey…

48:06.220 --> 48:07.888
-now that the cameras are off…
-Yeah.

48:07.971 --> 48:10.807
…and now that I see
how truly awesome you really are…

48:12.601 --> 48:16.980
do you mind if I ask you a personal
follow-up question, just between us?

48:19.358 --> 48:20.984
Sure, you can ask me anything.

48:24.196 --> 48:27.282
Did you actually get vetted for this job?

48:42.047 --> 48:43.423
I'm sorry. I just--

49:42.024 --> 49:44.651
-Goodbye, E!
-Oh, yes.

49:44.735 --> 49:48.113
-Eric, it's been a pleasure.
-Thank you.

49:48.197 --> 49:51.408
-Congratulations. We're gonna miss you!
-Thank you, Bradley.

49:51.491 --> 49:53.577
Good luck with everything. Okay.

49:58.665 --> 50:01.752
But I think we've all woken up
to what was happening.

50:01.835 --> 50:03.378
Well, I should just speak for myself.

50:03.462 --> 50:07.257
When I was worried about my own success.

50:07.341 --> 50:10.135
What was your relationship
with Mitch Kessler?

50:10.969 --> 50:12.387
He was my best friend.

50:13.722 --> 50:14.890
He was my best friend.

50:15.974 --> 50:21.271
But Mitch could be many things
to a lot of people, clearly.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.526
Welcome back.

51:21.456 --> 51:22.708
Welcome back.

51:34.428 --> 51:37.181
Okay, last looks. Moving in!

51:44.730 --> 51:46.064
Clear!

51:46.148 --> 51:51.987
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three.

51:52.070 --> 51:54.323
Two. Start your move, cue her.
