00:13.883 --> 00:15.841
Frank, come on, man!
We got to go!

00:15.841 --> 00:17.843
- We got to go!
- Oh, what?

00:17.843 --> 00:19.019
Come on, man,
we're gonna miss it.

00:19.019 --> 00:19.976
- Wake up, wake up. Come on.
- Wh-What?

00:19.976 --> 00:21.064
- Right away!
- Okay.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.936
Guys, make way.
Make way, please.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.374
- Hey, wait, no, no, please.
- Cutting it
pretty close there, pal.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.636
Ah, I feel like
I got to take a shit.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.725
No, no, no, no, no.
There's no time for that.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.248
- Oh, God, excuse me. Come on.
- No, no, no, no,
no autographs.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.989
- I'm not ready for this.
- Listen, listen.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.251
- You got it, you got it,
you got it.
- Listen to me.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.297
- Back off, back off.
- Frank, you are ready.

00:36.297 --> 00:39.865
Everything you need
is already inside you.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.390
Move. No, out of the way.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.683
<i>Dennis, please.</i>

01:14.683 --> 01:16.119
- Just... Dennis, please, please.
- God, no.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.034
- Pretty please, just help me.
- No! No, Mac.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.862
I'm not helping you, okay?

01:19.862 --> 01:21.646
Stop talking to me about Johnny.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.692
Well, hey, I could help you
with your guy troubles.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.521
No, thanks, Dee.
You suck with men.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.480
Tell that to the guy leaving
my apartment this morning.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.962
That's right. Your girl
got her guts pumped last night.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.616
Oh, my God, that is disgusting.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.835
- Your guts pumped?
- Aren't you, like, 60?

01:36.835 --> 01:39.099
- You're not a girl.
- Yeah, come on, Dee.
This is insane.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.665
- I mean... really.
- Who talks like that?

01:40.665 --> 01:42.972
And, by the way, anybody can
get a guy to bang them once.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.017
Okay, well, I guarantee you

01:45.017 --> 01:46.802
he'll be coming back
for seconds.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.805
In fact, he pulled
an old move of mine.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.894
He took my phone "by mistake"

01:51.894 --> 01:53.156
so that he could see me again.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.724
Oh, okay. Yeah.

01:55.724 --> 01:56.681
- Mm-hmm.
- How's he gonna call you?

02:00.207 --> 02:02.383
- Dennis, can you
help me get my phone--
- No.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.820
- Dennis, Dennis, I need
your help really quick, man.
- No!

02:04.820 --> 02:06.430
Do you remember when we stole a
restaurant buzzer the other day?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.823
I can't find it anywhere.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.129
It's a matter of
national security here, man.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.826
Oh, yes, no, no, I'm sure, yeah.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.306
You know what? Maybe it's in
the back office. Let me check

02:12.306 --> 02:13.785
the back office. Frank,
let me check the back office.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.439
Hey, uh, Frank, could you
help me with something?

02:15.439 --> 02:16.832
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

02:16.832 --> 02:18.094
You want Frank's help
with your guy troubles?

02:18.094 --> 02:19.443
He's insanely homophobic.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.663
Huh? Not anymore.

02:21.663 --> 02:24.231
No, once Mac did the dance,

02:24.231 --> 02:25.841
then I get it.
I get the gay thing.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.190
He gets it.
He's an ally now.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.974
Okay, so, Frank, I need
some relationship advice.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.150
- Yeah.
- I'm having some issues

02:30.150 --> 02:31.934
- with this guy that I'm dating.
- Yeah.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.240
- I want to take it
to the next level, you know,
- Right.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.459
by actually meeting this guy.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.591
What, you've never met the guy?

02:36.591 --> 02:38.027
No, never met him,

02:38.027 --> 02:39.420
never spoken with him,
never seen him,

02:39.420 --> 02:40.856
but it's not weird

02:40.856 --> 02:42.074
because we're in
constant communication

02:42.074 --> 02:42.901
through the beads.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.730
The beads?

02:45.730 --> 02:47.384
Oh, yes.
The extra-large anal beads

02:47.384 --> 02:49.038
that I shoved up my butt,

02:49.038 --> 02:50.387
and Johnny can control them

02:50.387 --> 02:52.433
via an app on his phone.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.912
And when I feel the buzz,

02:53.912 --> 02:55.740
I know it's time
to go to the motel

02:55.740 --> 02:57.438
and wait.
It's very romantic.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.876
Uh, yes, he's never
actually showed up before,

03:00.876 --> 03:04.227
but one day he will,
and it's going to be hot.

03:04.227 --> 03:07.099
That's it.
I'm out.

03:07.099 --> 03:10.581
I'm out. That's it. I don't
get it. I am never gonna get it.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.714
- Beads? You never said
anything about beads.
- Let me-let me explain it again.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.846
- What beads?
- It's beads that go into my ass.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.240
The dance never said anything
about no beads.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.633
Frank, I found it. I found it.
I found it.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.243
Let's get the hell out of here.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.853
We got it, guys, we're good.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.246
Anal beads up his ass.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.291
Dennis, can you please help me
get my phone back?

03:24.291 --> 03:25.509
'Cause I need my phone.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.032
No, Dennis,
help me, though. Help me because

03:27.032 --> 03:29.078
- I need help--
- No, you are beyond help, okay?

03:29.078 --> 03:30.166
You let a stranger
hack your butthole. Dennis--

03:30.166 --> 03:32.821
Enough! Enough.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.389
It is clear that I'm not going
to get a moment's peace until

03:35.389 --> 03:37.173
I foist you two
off on someone else,

03:37.173 --> 03:38.914
so, fine, I will help you.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.437
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, yeah! All right, all right,

03:40.437 --> 03:42.352
<i>let's go.</i>

03:42.352 --> 03:44.789
This is all I could find.

03:44.789 --> 03:47.270
Yeah, no, this is good. Um...

03:47.270 --> 03:49.054
Okay, are there, like, a pair
of, like, weird spy glasses

03:49.054 --> 03:50.969
in here or anything?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.581
- Aw, shit.
- They dropped all those charges
weeks ago. Wh--

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
Call you back.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.933
Hey, what are you guys doing
with all my research equipment?

03:57.933 --> 03:59.674
Charlie and Frank
are gonna play spies.

03:59.674 --> 04:00.675
Yeah, well, we're not
playing spies,

04:00.675 --> 04:02.198
we're playing chess, okay?

04:02.198 --> 04:03.852
There's a Russian grandmaster
coming to town.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.723
I'm entering Frank
in the tournament,

04:05.723 --> 04:07.290
and then he's gonna
rise through the ranks,

04:07.290 --> 04:09.161
and he's gonna beat
this guy's ass, USA style.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.728
So, I need the glasses,
Uncle Jack,

04:10.728 --> 04:12.730
because Frank's got to be able
to transmit me the board

04:12.730 --> 04:14.297
while I play along
on a computer

04:14.297 --> 04:16.168
and I signal him the moves
with the restaurant buzzer.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.301
No, stop, stop, stop.
Uh, you're gonna break it.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.955
This is, uh,
very sensitive equipment.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.870
Right, yeah, okay.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.698
Look, do you have
the spy glasses or not, dude?

04:23.698 --> 04:25.482
Fine. I'll let you borrow them,
but I'm coming with.

04:25.482 --> 04:26.788
Okay? I don't want you
breaking any of this.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.138
A play date.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.487
- Goddamn it.
- Oh, yeah.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.097
- Like we used to.
- We never did.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.317
- Ah... You don't remember.
- Man, we never did.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.974
I mean, what is taking
Uncle Jack so long?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.976
Well, why don't we just go in?

04:40.976 --> 04:42.151
Hang on.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.113
- What the...
- Is that-is that him?

04:48.113 --> 04:49.898
Holy shit.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.334
Uh, Uncle Jack,

04:51.334 --> 04:52.857
what-what is this?

04:52.857 --> 04:54.946
My ice cream truck.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.384
You know, I-I have, like,
a side business.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.691
Ugh. All right, fine. You know
what? Actually, this could work.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.998
- You got the spy glasses?
- Yeah. Here they are.
- Glasses.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.479
- Here's how this goes.
Frank, you got the buzzer?
- Yeah, I got the buzzer.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.089
- All right, so Frank's got
a buzzer in his pocket, okay?
- I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.047
So, he'll hover his hand
over the piece, you know,

05:09.047 --> 05:11.180
one buzz for yes,
two buzzes for no,

05:11.180 --> 05:13.008
three if you need him to switch
to a different piece, okay?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.270
Same goes for where
to put it down. Got it?

05:14.270 --> 05:15.837
- Okay. Yup.
- You clear?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.404
- Give me a Push Pop, will you?
- And get him a Push Pop.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.189
What? Oh, no, I-I don't have
any ice cream.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.409
- Oh.
- Oh, my God. All right, fine.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.324
Just... just...

05:24.324 --> 05:26.108
- get to your spot
and play the-- Ugh.
- Okay.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.892
Hey, I'll be watching you.

05:29.372 --> 05:32.027
Hm...

05:32.027 --> 05:34.159
Should I go here?

05:34.159 --> 05:37.467
Mm. Or should I go...

05:37.467 --> 05:39.295
here?

05:39.295 --> 05:40.818
<i>Charlie, don't look at the kid,</i>

05:40.818 --> 05:42.385
<i>look at the board. Actually,</i>

05:42.385 --> 05:44.692
one quick look at the kid again,
so I can get a screen grab.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.781
- Gross, no, man, no.
- No? No?

05:46.781 --> 05:48.217
I-- No, not you. Sorry.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.088
Talking to the voices
in my head, so...

05:50.088 --> 05:51.960
- <i>Stay on the board.</i>
- Yup. Yes.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.744
Don't mind my friend.
He's schizophrenic.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.267
I am, yeah.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.358
- <i>Got it.</i>
- Go eh...

05:59.315 --> 06:01.056
Boom.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.971
I took your little
castle-y thing.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.407
Suck on that,

06:04.407 --> 06:05.756
<i>boy!</i>

06:05.756 --> 06:07.976
If he does, let me get
another screen grab.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.239
Shut up, dude.
That's gross, man.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.372
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Sir?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.069
Uh, sir, may I have
a word with you?

06:14.069 --> 06:15.549
Um, absolutely not, because
I'm in the middle of watching

06:15.549 --> 06:17.333
a game of chess.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.814
Uh, there is no alcohol allowed
on the premises.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.816
What? Wh-What do you mean?

06:21.816 --> 06:23.121
Like, I got to drink wine
or something?

06:23.121 --> 06:25.036
No alcohol at all.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.125
At a sporting event?
That's crazy.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.693
Fine, dude. Here you go.

06:29.693 --> 06:32.087
Frank, I'm gonna have to find
some way to sneak beer in here.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.567
Excuse me?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.569
Dude, are you still here?
Go away.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.614
I gave you the beer, man.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.836
Now, as you're both aware,
I have a foolproof system

06:41.836 --> 06:43.751
for attracting a woman.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.101
But I also have
a foolproof system

06:46.101 --> 06:48.016
for attracting a man.

06:48.016 --> 06:51.019
- Aw, awesome.
- No way.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.412
- Why?
- How come?
- Shh, shh.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.501
Shh. Shh.

06:54.501 --> 06:57.591
Okay.
Now, it begins

06:57.591 --> 07:01.290
with me setting you both up
with nice, normal dates.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.118
<i>You will begin by greeting them</i>

07:03.118 --> 07:04.902
<i>with the traditional pleasantries.</i>

07:04.902 --> 07:06.338
Very nice to meet you, Patrick.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.470
Kyle, it's a pleasure.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.993
Pleasure's all mine.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.952
<i>I'll be nearby, of course,</i>

07:10.952 --> 07:12.736
<i>to make sure nothing goes awry.</i>

07:14.521 --> 07:16.871
Step one.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.482
S-- suppress your instincts.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.875
See, your first instinct

07:20.875 --> 07:22.485
is going to be to try
to make yourself

07:22.485 --> 07:24.531
seem awesome to him,
but that's wrong.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.880
'Cause this isn't about you.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.925
This is a man
we're talking about.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.274
It's always about him.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.754
Okay?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.234
So, you're going to...

07:32.234 --> 07:34.758
I-- inflate his ego.

07:34.758 --> 07:38.501
Make him feel like
he's awesome, he's funny,

07:38.501 --> 07:41.722
he's the most interesting
person in the room.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.506
You're the most interesting
person in this room.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.899
Uhp, uhp, uhp. Hi.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.335
Hello.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.597
I just wanted to come over
and introduce myself.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.164
I'm-I'm the manager

07:49.164 --> 07:50.774
- of the establishment.
- Yes, I was just saying

07:50.774 --> 07:52.559
that he's the most interesting
man in the room.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.909
Yeah. You know, it's--
I-I caught that, actually,

07:54.909 --> 07:56.388
and I wanted to say to you

07:56.388 --> 07:57.868
that, uh, Mac does,

07:57.868 --> 07:59.914
in fact, know everyone here,

07:59.914 --> 08:02.264
which he would, of course,

08:02.264 --> 08:05.049
have to in order to have said
something like that.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.356
So, it's meaningful.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.707
Now, once your man's
feeling important,

08:10.707 --> 08:12.970
you're gonna show him
that you...

08:12.970 --> 08:15.233
N-- need his power.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.713
Mm.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.193
See, every man's greatest fear

08:18.193 --> 08:20.325
is that he's a... pussy.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.154
- Mm.
- You need to make him
feel powerful.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.549
Oh, boy.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.552
Oh... man. I just can't seem
to get this open.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.640
Do you think you could
help me out?

08:30.640 --> 08:31.946
Sure.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.517
Oh, this is really on tight.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.781
Uh, are you-are you
being serious?

08:40.781 --> 08:42.609
Oh, Christ, Bozo, give it back
to me. I'll do it.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.524
Wai-- No, no. Uh, no.
Yeah, it's-- You can't.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.916
You can't. You couldn't.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.744
No one could,
because these bottles...

08:47.744 --> 08:50.051
are all, uh...

08:50.051 --> 08:52.314
they're defective
and un-openable.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.185
Yeah, there's been a recall,
actually. See?

08:54.185 --> 08:56.318
It's-it's impossible.
Nobody could...

08:56.318 --> 08:59.364
...get these
open today.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.193
- Mm.
- You know what? You do look
very, very strong.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.848
You mind giving this
one more shot for me?

09:04.848 --> 09:07.634
Let's see if you can get it.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.592
- Oh!
- Whoa.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.724
- Wow.
- Wow.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.989
Now that your man's
feeling powerful,

09:14.989 --> 09:17.078
on top of the world, you must...

09:17.078 --> 09:18.862
rip it away from him.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.996
You're going to N--
negate his power.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.607
Yeah, but this
needs to be subtle.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.914
A man's ego is... fragile.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.525
The goal here is to make him
feel that he may be a...

09:29.525 --> 09:31.092
tad bit inadequate,

09:31.092 --> 09:33.442
in comparison, maybe,
to a former lover.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.530
- Yes?
- Oh.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.097
But don't lay it on too thick.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.621
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Subtle.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.623
I used to fuck LeBron James.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.234
Oh, God.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.194
Now, even if things have gone

09:46.194 --> 09:47.456
a little off the rails
at this point,

09:47.456 --> 09:48.631
we can get things back on track

09:48.631 --> 09:50.241
with a classic.

09:50.241 --> 09:53.767
E-- engage physically.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.682
- Hey-o.
- Yeah.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.901
But you got to make sure
that your physical engagement

09:57.901 --> 10:00.121
is appropriate
to the environment, okay?

10:00.121 --> 10:03.167
Your demeanor wants to remain
elegant and classy.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.865
- Right.
- Mm. Got it.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.740
What are you doing?

10:10.740 --> 10:13.264
I'm grabbing your ding-dong.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.744
No!

10:14.744 --> 10:16.877
No, yeah. That's, uh...

10:16.877 --> 10:18.922
And now for the final step,

10:18.922 --> 10:21.446
the most profound move
of the entire system.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.101
D.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.322
"Do you want a tissue?"

10:27.322 --> 10:29.498
- Huh?
- Huh?

10:29.498 --> 10:32.109
You see, with this one
simple but profound question,

10:32.109 --> 10:34.329
you instantly transport
this man back to a time

10:34.329 --> 10:36.287
when he was a tiny,
snot-nosed little bitch

10:36.287 --> 10:38.115
who depended on the most
important person in his life

10:38.115 --> 10:39.856
for absolutely everything.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.815
The person who inflated his ego,

10:41.815 --> 10:43.730
who made him feel powerful,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.340
but also powerless.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.429
The person whose validation

10:47.429 --> 10:50.301
he's been seeking
his entire life.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.563
Guys,

10:51.563 --> 10:52.956
the way to make a man

10:52.956 --> 10:54.741
fall in love with you

10:54.741 --> 10:57.178
is to make him feel

10:57.178 --> 10:59.397
like you are...

10:59.397 --> 11:02.139
his mommy.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.401
Well, it's getting late.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.447
Yeah.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.275
Yeah, we should
probably call it.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.712
I have, uh, one thing
that I'd like to ask you.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.759
Um... do you need a tissue?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.761
Do you need a tissue?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.850
- What?
- What?

11:16.850 --> 11:18.808
- You need a tissue.
- You need a tissue.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.724
Oh. Oh, really? Ah...

11:21.724 --> 11:23.508
Ah, just...
That's-that's embarrassing.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.206
Hang on, all right, stop it.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.642
There we go. Come here.

11:26.642 --> 11:30.211
There we go. Now

11:30.211 --> 11:33.040
my little man
is all ready for his day.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.519
<i>Before, they wanted</i>

11:34.519 --> 11:37.087
<i>nothing more than
this date to be over.</i>

11:37.087 --> 11:38.436
<i>But now they can't help
but ask...</i>

11:38.436 --> 11:41.744
Hey, um, any chance...

11:41.744 --> 11:43.180
Would you want to...

11:43.180 --> 11:44.268
...do this again...

11:44.268 --> 11:45.400
...sometime?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.401
Mm.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.707
It worked.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.273
And there you have it.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.275
That, my friends, is...

11:51.275 --> 11:53.408
the SINNED system.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.757
- Oh!
- Whoa!

11:54.757 --> 11:56.498
- Oh, ho!
- Amazing.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.934
- Crazy creepy, though,
- Oh, yeah, very creepy.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.327
with all the mom stuff, and...

11:59.327 --> 12:00.763
the name's a little
heavy-handed.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.330
Yeah, took a-took a lot
to get there.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.375
It's not as clean
as the DENNIS system.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.942
Well, but listen,
the DENNIS system--

12:05.942 --> 12:07.378
that's a system
for getting a woman.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.815
This is a system
for getting a man,

12:08.815 --> 12:12.122
and that's why SINNED
is actually...

12:12.122 --> 12:13.515
DENNIS backwards.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.561
Oh, my God!

12:16.561 --> 12:18.650
- That's amazing.
- How-how did that line up
like that?

12:18.650 --> 12:19.956
Yeah, like,
what are the odds, though?

12:19.956 --> 12:22.350
- Oh, wow.
- What do you-- The odds of what?

12:22.350 --> 12:24.221
What are the odds that
the steps to the system

12:24.221 --> 12:26.006
would be DENNIS backwards

12:26.006 --> 12:27.659
and that they would spell out
the word "sinned?"

12:27.659 --> 12:30.924
High! High.
'Cause I made it up.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.840
- Oh! Yeah, he did it on purpose.
- Oh, my... He made it up.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.281
- Hey-o!
- Hey-o!

12:40.281 --> 12:41.195
Hey, hey, hey!

12:41.195 --> 12:43.066
What's up, guy--

12:43.066 --> 12:44.328
You know what, I got to say,

12:44.328 --> 12:46.113
I am, I'm still, like,
buzzing from last night.

12:46.113 --> 12:46.983
- Got a little hairy there
for a second, didn't it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:46.983 --> 12:47.984
Yeah, but we pulled it off.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.072
- We sure did!
- We really did.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.291
- We really did.
- Success.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.119
All right, so talk to me,
when are those

12:52.119 --> 12:53.903
- second dates?
- Ooh, yeah, no,
that's not happening.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.949
What do you mean,
that's not happening?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.299
Well, I got home last night,
and, I, uh, found myself

12:58.299 --> 13:00.562
real horny, so I popped
a couple of Mommy's magic beans

13:00.562 --> 13:02.346
and headed over to Kyle's house.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.306
Roofies. I roofied myself. Yeah,

13:05.306 --> 13:07.090
not 100% sure
if we plowed or not,

13:07.090 --> 13:09.223
but I do know I got this.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.964
You stole his phone.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.792
- Yeah, well, I'll be honest,
- Aw...

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
the details
are a bit hazy, still,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.926
but I do know
I stole somebody's phone.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.754
- And you?
- Oh, I'm not doing it either.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.974
- Yeah!
- Okay, but I have
a good reason, Dennis.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.628
I have a really good reason,
'cause I'm not a-a rapist

13:23.628 --> 13:26.153
and a thief like Dee is.
I'm-I'm just a boy in love.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.632
I'm just a boy
in love with Johnny,

13:27.632 --> 13:30.157
and I realized that
I-I have to be with him.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.985
Well, no, see,
that's-that's the thing--

13:31.985 --> 13:34.944
Johnny doesn't love you.
He doesn't even like you.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.728
- You don't know him.
- No, no, no.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.729
You don't know him.

13:37.729 --> 13:38.948
I know him better than you.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.428
Do you? Because I am him.

13:41.864 --> 13:42.909
What?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.736
I invented Johnny as a means

13:44.736 --> 13:45.607
of getting you
out of the apartment

13:45.607 --> 13:46.738
when you were irritating me.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.262
I don't understand.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.959
Okay, like,
when "Johnny" sent you out

13:49.959 --> 13:51.352
to go get those
soft-shell crabs,

13:51.352 --> 13:52.657
- you remember that?
- Yeah.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.137
Yeah. And he was
supposed to meet you,

13:54.137 --> 13:55.965
- but he didn't.
He ghosted you, right?
- No.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.533
And so, you came sauntering back
in the house and all depressed,

13:58.533 --> 14:00.448
and I was like,
"Well, I tell you what, buddy,

14:00.448 --> 14:03.320
I'll eat the soft-shell crabs.
They are my favorite."

14:03.320 --> 14:05.192
And I said, "Oh, my God,
what a coincidence

14:05.192 --> 14:07.455
because they're-they're
Johnny's favorite, too."

14:07.455 --> 14:09.544
- Yeah, because I am Johnny.
- Then who's Dennis?

14:09.544 --> 14:12.025
- What do you mean?
- Well, if you're Johnny,
then who-- who's you?

14:12.025 --> 14:14.114
I'm Dennis!
I've always been Dennis.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.681
L-L-Let me-- This is gonna make
it all clear. This is my phone,

14:16.681 --> 14:18.248
- Don't want to get into this--
- and when I push
a certain button...

14:18.248 --> 14:19.728
Wait, hold on.
H-Hold on a second.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.817
- What, what?
- Johnny's buzzing me.
I got-- Look.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.950
- No, I pushed the button.
- I haven't heard
from him in a while,

14:23.950 --> 14:25.908
and I'm going to the motel.
I got to meet him.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.215
- I'm sorry.
- Mac, it's not Johnny. I pushed
the button on my phone--

14:28.215 --> 14:29.694
I can't engage with you
on this right now.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.479
I got to-I got to
go see Johnny.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.481
Dennis! Dennis.
I need your help, man.

14:33.481 --> 14:34.482
- I need your help, big-time.
- No, no!

14:34.482 --> 14:36.092
I am done helping people.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.702
Dude, we're so close, man.
We're in the finals.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.269
- Yeah? I don't care.
- And there's no way

14:39.269 --> 14:41.315
I'm gonna be able to sneak a
restaurant buzzer in now.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.664
Okay, you know what?
You're not gonna stop talking.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.100
- So, I-I'm just...
- Yes-- No, I'm not, because,

14:44.100 --> 14:45.667
- Dennis, I need your help.
Look, I've
- I don't care.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.321
been controlling Frank using
the restaurant buzzer, okay?

14:47.321 --> 14:48.931
- Wait a-wait a-- whoa, what...
- And it's the perfect plan.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.454
Hold on a second.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.894
Sorry, did you just say
you've been...

14:54.894 --> 14:58.375
controlling Frank
like a pawn in a game?

14:58.375 --> 15:01.204
Like a puppet?

15:01.204 --> 15:03.250
Uh, I didn't say
any of those words, but yeah.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.816
I've been-I've been controlling
Frank, uh, in chess, yes.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.601
Very interesting.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.821
And Frank's been aware
of the puppetry the entire time?

15:09.821 --> 15:12.085
Yeah, of course. He's in on it.
But dude, it's over, right?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.390
Unless you know a way
I can sneak

15:13.390 --> 15:15.827
something into this tournament
that vibrates.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.224
I think I may have a way,
but, uh...

15:21.224 --> 15:22.573
Frank's not gonna like it.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.620
- Dee.
- Mm.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.274
Got any more
of those magic beans?

15:27.274 --> 15:28.405
Yeah.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.450
'Cause we're gonna need

15:29.450 --> 15:31.147
to turn the lights out.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.283
Frank! Frank, get up!

15:36.283 --> 15:37.893
- Wow, what...
- Wake up! Wake up, man!

15:37.893 --> 15:39.286
- We're late!
- Okay. What?

15:39.286 --> 15:42.115
We're gonna miss it, dude.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.073
Move. No, out of the way.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.640
Jesus, Frank. Cutting it
pretty close there, pal.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.163
Ah, feel like
I got to take a shit.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.209
What? You got to sh--
Don't shit, don't shit.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.819
- No, no, no.
There's no time for that.
- I'm not ready for this.

15:50.819 --> 15:54.170
No, listen to me, listen to me.
You are ready.

15:54.170 --> 15:57.957
Everything you need
is already inside you.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.350
Move. No, out of the way.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.013

<i>Mr. Reynolds is about
to make his first move.</i>

You got this, Frank!

16:18.020 --> 16:19.456
You got this, man!

16:22.329 --> 16:24.809
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.986
Frank, trust your gut.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.775
Ooh.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.255
Oh.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.089
<i>He seems a little
uncomfortable, Susan.</i>

16:43.089 --> 16:45.178
<i>Just think about
the incredible amount</i>

16:45.178 --> 16:46.788
<i>of pressure
he's feeling right now.</i>

16:46.788 --> 16:48.877
Oh...

16:52.968 --> 16:55.101
Ho, ho.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.059

16:59.409 --> 17:02.064
Oh.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.805
- Oh, God, no.
- Mr. Reynolds seems
to be going through

17:03.805 --> 17:05.589
a range of emotions

17:05.589 --> 17:07.722
<i>while contemplating
his first move.</i>

17:07.722 --> 17:09.724
You don't have to do this.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.073
You don't have to do it.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.119
S-Should I go here?

17:13.119 --> 17:15.860
Oh...

17:15.860 --> 17:18.037
Uh... There?

17:21.170 --> 17:22.693

17:26.219 --> 17:30.049
Take your time. Take your time.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.061
You don't have to do this!

17:44.280 --> 17:46.021
Should I go there?
Aah!

17:52.810 --> 17:54.377
Hey, Dennis.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.292
Oh, man, I had
the craziest night last night,

17:56.292 --> 17:58.207
'cause I think I, like,
blacked out, and then,

17:58.207 --> 18:00.601
when I woke up, I think
that Johnny broke up with me,

18:00.601 --> 18:02.603
- 'cause he was gone.
- Mac, I can't do this right now.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.952
Here?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.129
Here?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.131
Don't lose your shit, man.
Don't lose your shit.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.090

Nice.

18:15.050 --> 18:17.792

how else to tell you!

18:17.792 --> 18:20.708
Look, I have the texts.
I will show you the texts.

18:20.708 --> 18:24.015
Look, these are the texts that
I sent to you from my phone.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.149
Oh, my God.
You have Johnny's phone.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.498
- This is my...
- Give it to me.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.631
