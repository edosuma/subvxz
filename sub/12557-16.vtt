00:09.776 --> 00:11.644
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:11.679 --> 00:15.398
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:15.433 --> 00:17.283
a journey into a wondrous land

00:17.318 --> 00:19.152
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:19.187 --> 00:22.288
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

02:46.968 --> 02:48.184
Help!

02:48.219 --> 02:50.687
Please help!

02:50.722 --> 02:52.555
Who is it?

02:52.590 --> 02:55.058
Go away.

02:55.093 --> 02:56.309
I've been shot.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.811
I need help.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.697
Who are you?

03:00.732 --> 03:03.199
An... officer.

03:03.234 --> 03:04.450
Police.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.953
Please,
open the door.

03:06.988 --> 03:08.821
I need help.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.707
You're lying to me.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.209
I know you.

03:13.244 --> 03:15.078
You can't fool me.

03:15.113 --> 03:17.580
Help.

03:17.615 --> 03:18.831
You're lying.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.334
You're no policeman.

03:21.968 --> 03:26.339
Why can't you
leave me alone?

03:26.374 --> 03:28.841
I know who you are.

03:32.595 --> 03:35.732
I knowwhatyou are.

03:40.103 --> 03:43.106
An old woman
living in a nightmare.

03:43.141 --> 03:46.859
An old woman who has fought
a thousand battles with death

03:46.894 --> 03:48.745
and always won.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.247
Now she's faced
with a grim decision:

03:51.282 --> 03:53.750
Whether or not to open a door.

03:53.785 --> 03:56.252
And in some strange
and frightening way,

03:56.287 --> 03:59.372
she knows that this
seemingly ordinary door

03:59.407 --> 04:01.257
leads to the twilight zone.

04:06.129 --> 04:08.631
Won't somebody help?

04:31.823 --> 04:34.907
Unless you help me,

04:34.942 --> 04:38.044
i'm going to die.

04:38.079 --> 04:39.295
I...

04:39.330 --> 04:41.798
i don't think
i can move.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.917
Don't say that,
it isn't fair.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.054
You're trying
to trick me.

04:48.089 --> 04:51.174
Don't move.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.810
L-l-i'll close the door.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.061
What?

04:56.062 --> 04:59.816
I've been shot.

04:59.851 --> 05:02.318
I'm bleeding to death.

05:02.353 --> 05:04.821
Please.

05:04.856 --> 05:09.826
My name is harold... beldon.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.694
I need a doctor.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.197
Please, call the hospital.

05:14.232 --> 05:17.333
I haven't got a telephone.

05:17.368 --> 05:20.453
I'd have to unlock the door.

05:20.488 --> 05:24.207
You can't ask me to do that.

05:24.242 --> 05:26.709
I don't want to die.

05:27.343 --> 05:31.097
You understand.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.966
I know who you are.

05:34.717 --> 05:37.854
You're not going to help me?

05:39.105 --> 05:41.607
You're going to let me die?

05:41.642 --> 05:45.111
I don't understand.

05:45.146 --> 05:49.482
But... it hurts.

05:50.768 --> 05:51.367
Oh, it hurts.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.487
Stop. Stop.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.623
Why do you torture me?

05:57.658 --> 06:00.126
It isn't fair.

06:00.161 --> 06:03.880
I... i can't move.

06:03.915 --> 06:05.748
I...

06:05.783 --> 06:08.251
ooh, it hurts.

06:08.286 --> 06:10.386
It isn't fair.

06:12.255 --> 06:16.642
It isn't fair.

06:41.784 --> 06:44.670
I'm still alive.

07:37.089 --> 07:40.843
Now, listen, you should
try and get some rest.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.346
Really, i feel much better.

07:43.381 --> 07:47.733
When the doctor gets here,
he'll take me off your hands.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.605
You didn't call the doctor.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.859
Why not?

07:57.493 --> 07:59.362
I haven't got
a telephone.

07:59.397 --> 08:03.115
But couldn't you go
to one of the neighbors?

08:03.150 --> 08:06.252
There aren't any,
they've all moved away.

08:06.287 --> 08:09.372
Trucks came and took
away their furniture.

08:09.407 --> 08:11.874
First one and
then another.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.262
And...

08:16.297 --> 08:19.382
even-even if i could
call a doctor somehow,

08:19.417 --> 08:23.135
i couldn't take a chance
and let him in.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.638
Don't you see?

08:25.673 --> 08:28.140
He might behim.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.643
Him?

08:30.678 --> 08:32.528
Mr. Death.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.397
I know he's out there.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.899
He's trying to get in.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.402
He comes to the door
and knocks.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.904
He begs me to let him in.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.041
Last week he said
he came from the gas company.

08:45.076 --> 08:47.543
Oh, he's clever.

08:47.578 --> 08:51.297
After that, he claimed to be
a contractor hired by the city.

08:51.914 --> 08:53.799
I knew who he was.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.919
He said this building
was condemned

08:56.954 --> 08:58.804
that i'd have to leave.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.924
I kept the door locked,

09:01.959 --> 09:04.427
and he went away.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.312
He knows i'm onto him.

09:07.563 --> 09:09.432
Mr. Death?

09:10.683 --> 09:15.071
Is this a person,
like you or me?

09:15.106 --> 09:17.073
I know it sounds crazy,

09:17.108 --> 09:19.575
but it's true.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.444
I know it's true.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.329
But
people die

09:23.364 --> 09:25.197
all over
the world.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.084
Now how could one man
be in all those places

09:28.119 --> 09:29.335
at once?

09:29.370 --> 09:31.203
I don't know.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.706
Don't ask me that.

09:33.741 --> 09:37.460
Maybe there is more than one.

09:37.495 --> 09:38.711
Maybe...

09:40.596 --> 09:43.099
please don't cry, i...

09:43.134 --> 09:46.218
i don't want
to hurt you.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.104
Please, i'm sorry.

09:49.972 --> 09:51.857
There.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.233
At first,

10:01.268 --> 10:04.370
i couldn't be sure.

10:04.405 --> 10:06.872
It was a long time ago.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.741
I was on a bus.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.243
There was
an old woman

10:11.278 --> 10:13.746
sitting in front
of me knitting.

10:13.781 --> 10:17.500
Socks, i think.

10:17.535 --> 10:20.002
There was something
about her face.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.139
I thought i knew her.

10:23.174 --> 10:26.258
Then this
young man got on.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.646
There were empty seats,
but he sat down beside her.

10:30.681 --> 10:33.149
He didn't say
anything, but...

10:33.184 --> 10:38.154
his being there upset her.

10:38.189 --> 10:40.656
He seemed a nice young man.

10:40.691 --> 10:43.159
When she dropped her yarn,

10:43.194 --> 10:46.278
he picked it up,
right in front of me.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.781
He held it out to her.

10:48.816 --> 10:52.535
I saw their fingers touch.

10:52.570 --> 10:57.540
He got out at the next stop.

10:57.575 --> 11:02.545
When the bus reached
the end of the line...

11:02.580 --> 11:05.047
she was dead.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.298
Hmm.

11:07.550 --> 11:10.686
But you said yourself
she was an old woman.

11:10.721 --> 11:13.689
But i've seen him since,
several times.

11:13.724 --> 11:17.443
I've seen him in crowds,
i've watched for him.

11:17.478 --> 11:21.197
Every time someone i knew died,
he was there.

11:21.232 --> 11:23.699
Once he was a young soldier,

11:23.734 --> 11:26.819
a salesman, a taxi driver-

11:26.854 --> 11:29.955
someone you wouldn't notice

11:29.990 --> 11:31.824
unless you
were watching.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.326
I wondered why
i could see him

11:34.361 --> 11:37.463
and that no one
else could.

11:37.498 --> 11:39.715
Then i knew.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.835
It was because
i was getting older

11:42.870 --> 11:44.720
and my time was coming.

11:44.755 --> 11:48.474
I could see clearer than
younger people could.

11:48.509 --> 11:49.975
All right.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.095
But if you knew what he
looked like, why be afraid?

11:53.130 --> 11:55.231
You could avoid him.

11:55.266 --> 11:58.350
Because his face is always
different, i couldn't be sure.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.736
How about when you go out?

12:00.771 --> 12:02.988
Couldn't he touch you then

12:03.023 --> 12:04.240
if he wanted to?

12:04.857 --> 12:06.108
I never go out.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.493
Never?

12:07.528 --> 12:11.247
I haven't been
out for years.

12:11.282 --> 12:14.366
Well, what do you do about food?

12:14.750 --> 12:16.619
A boy delivers it.

12:16.654 --> 12:19.121
I leave him money and a list.

12:19.755 --> 12:22.258
And i always wait
until he's gone away

12:22.293 --> 12:24.760
before i unlock the door.

12:24.795 --> 12:27.880
How can you live like this?

12:28.013 --> 12:30.516
If i don't live like this,
i won't live at all.

12:30.551 --> 12:32.017
If i don't watch out,

12:32.052 --> 12:34.520
if i let down
even for a moment,

12:34.555 --> 12:35.771
he'll get in.

12:35.806 --> 12:38.274
I know he will.

12:43.279 --> 12:46.398
I haven't always
lived like this.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.152
I was young once.

12:50.187 --> 12:54.540
People said i was pretty.

12:55.157 --> 12:58.294
I lived out in the sunlight.

13:00.796 --> 13:05.801
People said i'd spoil
my fine complexion.

13:05.836 --> 13:07.670
I didn't care.

13:09.555 --> 13:12.675
I loved outdoor things.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.062
I lived out in the sunlight.

13:20.182 --> 13:23.936
I've always hated
the dark and the cold.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.941
I'm old.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.443
I've lived a long time.

13:33.329 --> 13:35.831
But i don't want to die.

13:35.866 --> 13:38.334
I'd rather live in the dark

13:38.369 --> 13:41.453
than not live at all.

13:47.710 --> 13:48.961
Here.

13:48.996 --> 13:52.097
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.966
We're alone here.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.468
And there's nobody at the door.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.354
You need some rest...

14:06.478 --> 14:08.364
and i need help.

14:53.909 --> 14:56.412
No.

14:56.447 --> 14:58.414
There's nothing to be afraid of.

14:58.449 --> 15:01.533
You better answer it.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.789
Go on.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.674
That's right.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.176
Go ahead.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.432
Go ahead,
answer it.

15:21.437 --> 15:25.441
I'm sorry, lady,
but i've got my orders.

15:27.943 --> 15:30.062
I can't fool around any longer.

15:52.635 --> 15:54.503
Easy, lady.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.388
Just lie quiet

15:56.423 --> 15:59.508
till you get
your strength back.

16:01.510 --> 16:05.898
You gave me quite a scare
when you caved in like that.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.774
And still i live.

16:18.027 --> 16:20.529
You got to understand,
ma'am, i...

16:20.564 --> 16:24.283
i don't get no pleasure
out of busting in doors.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.669
You don't seem
to realize

16:26.704 --> 16:29.171
how important
this is.

16:29.206 --> 16:31.924
I've got a-a crew and
equipment coming in an hour

16:31.959 --> 16:33.175
to pull this tenement down.

16:33.210 --> 16:36.795
Begging your pardon, ma'am,
but it's long overdue.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.298
I'm surprised
it's still standing.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.800
And you're really...

16:41.835 --> 16:43.686
not mr. Death?

16:48.057 --> 16:49.942
Well...

16:49.977 --> 16:52.444
i don't know what
you're talking about.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.313
All i know is

16:54.348 --> 16:57.449
i got a contract to demolish
this row of buildings.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.952
Everybody else
moved out long ago.

16:59.987 --> 17:01.203
Until the other day,

17:01.238 --> 17:03.572
i thought this building
was deserted.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.709
I seen them windows boarded up,
and i figured you moved, too.

17:06.743 --> 17:09.328
You want me to go outside?

17:09.363 --> 17:12.464
You want me to leave here?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.967
I can't.

17:15.002 --> 17:17.219
You were notified months ago,
right?

17:17.253 --> 17:19.088
I'm just trying to do my job.

17:19.123 --> 17:21.589
These buildings
were condemned by the city,

17:21.625 --> 17:23.474
and i'm the one

17:23.510 --> 17:24.843
who's got
to tear them down.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.729
How can you.

17:26.763 --> 17:29.231
This building has had it.

17:29.266 --> 17:31.100
It's worn out,
used up.

17:31.135 --> 17:34.853
All these buildings
have got to come down.

17:41.110 --> 17:43.612
I ain't a monster, lady.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.749
I... i've got a heart
just like anybody else,

17:46.784 --> 17:50.502
but, uh...

17:50.537 --> 17:53.005
i can see how you
could get attached to a place

17:53.040 --> 17:54.873
and not want
to see it wrecked,

17:54.908 --> 17:57.376
but when a building is old,
it's dangerous.

17:57.411 --> 18:02.381
It's got to come down
to make room for a new one.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.517
That's life, lady.

18:05.552 --> 18:09.271
Old make room for the new.

18:09.306 --> 18:11.140
Well, people get the idea

18:11.175 --> 18:13.642
that i'm kind of destroyer,
but...

18:14.276 --> 18:18.030
they think i get kicks
out of tearing stuff down.

18:18.065 --> 18:20.532
That ain't the way it is.

18:20.567 --> 18:24.903
I... i just clear the ground
so other people can build.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.789
In a way,
i help them do it.

18:26.824 --> 18:29.908
Look around-
it's the way things are.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.045
A big tree falls,
and a new one

18:33.080 --> 18:36.165
grow right out
of the same ground.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.667
Old animals die and...

18:38.702 --> 18:42.421
young ones
take their places.

18:42.456 --> 18:46.809
Even people step aside
when it's time.

18:46.844 --> 18:49.311
I won't.

18:53.682 --> 18:56.185
The door.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.439
There's no need
in that.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.941
Now, what's the sense
of locking a door

19:02.976 --> 19:04.827
that won't even
be here in an hour?

19:05.444 --> 19:07.946
If you've got any
possessions you'd want to keep,

19:07.981 --> 19:11.083
i'd move them out.
I'll help you.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.454
Now, look, i've been
trying to go easy,

19:15.489 --> 19:17.339
but if you insist
on staying here,

19:17.374 --> 19:20.459
i'll have to call a cop.

19:20.494 --> 19:23.595
Please cooperate, lady.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.464
Of course.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.966
Explain to him.

19:28.001 --> 19:31.720
Tell him the reason
i can't go out there.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.857
You'll help me,
won't you?

19:34.892 --> 19:37.359
What are you doing?

19:37.394 --> 19:39.228
Who are you talking to?

19:39.263 --> 19:42.981
Mr. Beldon
is a policeman.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.233
Please tell him.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.620
I'm sorry, but if
you're still here

19:48.655 --> 19:50.489
when the crew arrives,

19:50.524 --> 19:52.991
i'll have to call a cop.

20:03.001 --> 20:06.138
Why didn't you help me?

20:06.173 --> 20:08.640
I thought you understood.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.266
You.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.522
He looked right at you

20:23.557 --> 20:26.024
and didn't see you.

20:28.527 --> 20:31.029
No!

20:31.064 --> 20:34.783
Look in the mirror, wanda.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.938
You tricked me.

20:55.973 --> 20:57.806
It was you

20:57.841 --> 21:00.442
all the time.

21:00.477 --> 21:01.693
Yes.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.196
I tricked you.

21:04.231 --> 21:05.948
But why?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.450
The moment i let you inside,

21:09.067 --> 21:12.204
you could have taken me
anytime.

21:12.239 --> 21:14.706
But you were nice.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.826
You made me trust you.

21:17.861 --> 21:22.831
But i had
to make you understand.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.088
Am i really so bad?

21:30.123 --> 21:33.225
Am i really so frightening?

21:33.260 --> 21:35.844
You've talked to me,

21:35.879 --> 21:37.729
you've confided in me.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.232
Have i tried to hurt you?

21:43.986 --> 21:46.488
It isn't me you're afraid of.

21:46.523 --> 21:49.608
You understand me.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.493
What you're afraid of

21:51.528 --> 21:53.996
is the unknown.

21:54.031 --> 21:55.247
Don't...

21:55.864 --> 21:58.367
don't be afraid.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.869
But i am afraid.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.754
The running's over.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.125
It's time to rest.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.513
Give me

22:11.548 --> 22:13.382
your hand.

22:13.417 --> 22:17.135
But i don't want to die.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.021
Trust me.

22:21.023 --> 22:22.274
No.

22:24.142 --> 22:26.645
No.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.399
Mother,

22:30.434 --> 22:32.901
give me your hand.

22:50.168 --> 22:51.420
You see,

22:51.553 --> 22:54.056
no shock.

22:54.091 --> 22:57.809
No engulfment.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.061
No tearing
asunder.

22:59.096 --> 23:03.932
What you feared would
come like an explosion

23:03.967 --> 23:06.435
is like a whisper.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.320
What you thought
was the end

23:08.437 --> 23:09.688
is the beginning.

23:09.723 --> 23:13.442
When will it happen?

23:13.477 --> 23:14.693
When will we go?

23:14.728 --> 23:16.945
Go?

23:18.830 --> 23:20.082
Look.

23:27.089 --> 23:30.208
We have
already begun.

23:50.228 --> 23:53.365
There was an old woman
who lived in a room

23:53.400 --> 23:56.485
and, like all of us,
was frightened of the dark,

23:56.520 --> 23:58.987
but who discovered in a minute
last fragment of her life

23:59.022 --> 24:00.872
that there was nothing
in the dark that wasn't there

24:00.907 --> 24:02.741
when the lights were on.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.495
Object lesson for the more
frightened amongst us, in or out

24:06.530 --> 24:08.997
of the twilight zone.

24:11.399 --> 24:14.336
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

24:14.371 --> 24:16.221
will tell you
about next week's story

24:16.256 --> 24:19.624
after this message.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.726
And now, mr. Serling.

24:21.761 --> 24:22.978
Next week, onthe twilight zone,

24:23.013 --> 24:26.731
we let you in on a... an
extravagant practical joke.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.234
A man who wants
to convey an illusion

24:29.269 --> 24:31.102
that the world
is coming to an end.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.988
Now there are jokes
and there are jokes,

24:33.023 --> 24:34.856
but this one
stands all by itself

24:34.891 --> 24:38.610
as an exercise in the very
different and the very bizarre.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.746
Our play is called
"one more pallbearer,"

24:41.781 --> 24:44.866
and we commend it to you
as something quite special.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.866
This is james arness.

25:17.901 --> 25:19.734
You know, it's only a short hop

25:19.769 --> 25:22.237
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

25:22.272 --> 25:24.739
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
