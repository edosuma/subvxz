WEBVTT

00:01.607 --> 00:03.183
You are being watched.

00:04.111 --> 00:06.142
The government has
a secret system.

00:06.434 --> 00:10.048
A machine that spies on
you every hour of every day.

00:10.789 --> 00:12.922
I know because I built it.

00:13.385 --> 00:15.714
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror, but,

00:15.799 --> 00:17.286
it sees everything.

00:17.435 --> 00:20.010
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people.

00:20.217 --> 00:21.445
People like you.

00:21.568 --> 00:24.040
Crimes that the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.003 --> 00:28.122
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.124 --> 00:30.641
But I needed a partner.

00:30.643 --> 00:32.643
Someone with the skills to intervene.

00:32.645 --> 00:35.463
Hunted by the authorities,

00:35.465 --> 00:37.198
we work in secret.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.150
You'll never find us.

00:39.152 --> 00:41.185
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.187 --> 00:42.653
if your number's up,

00:42.655 --> 00:44.021
we'll find you.

01:02.674 --> 01:05.476
Good morning, Finch.

01:08.847 --> 01:10.881
Don't you knock?

01:10.883 --> 01:12.316
Not if I can help it.

01:13.819 --> 01:16.938
I felt bad about blowing
your cover identity.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.240
Been looking for a new job
for you.

01:19.242 --> 01:22.893
Dog walker, maybe.
Or concert pianist?

01:24.947 --> 01:28.165
I have a job, Mr. Reese,
and so do you.

01:28.167 --> 01:31.702
The machine has sent us
a new number.

01:36.709 --> 01:39.043
His name's Joey Durban,

01:39.045 --> 01:41.578
a soldier
in the 107th infantry,

01:41.580 --> 01:45.633
just back from Afghanistan.

01:45.635 --> 01:47.602
Army commendation medal,

01:47.604 --> 01:49.203
purple heart--

01:49.205 --> 01:50.421
Guy was a fighter.

01:50.423 --> 01:52.106
Just like you.

01:52.108 --> 01:54.392
I fought beside the 107th
in Iraq.

01:54.394 --> 01:56.227
Most of them were just kids.

01:56.229 --> 01:59.614
Joined up because
they lost family or friends

01:59.616 --> 02:00.764
when the towers came down.

02:00.766 --> 02:03.267
Over there, they grew up fast.

02:03.269 --> 02:05.236
Or they died.

02:05.238 --> 02:07.238
Well, at least
Joey came home alive.

02:07.240 --> 02:11.125
And now you can help him
stay that way.

02:11.127 --> 02:13.744
He works as a doorman
at a building in midtown.

02:13.746 --> 02:15.212
I'm on it.

02:15.214 --> 02:17.081
Standard operating procedure--

02:17.083 --> 02:20.501
I'll clone his phone
for voice and texts.

02:20.503 --> 02:21.752
I'll start following him.

02:21.754 --> 02:23.554
And, uh, Finch...

02:23.556 --> 02:24.889
If you're going
to work all night,

02:24.891 --> 02:27.808
you should try
getting some exercise.

02:36.935 --> 02:39.353
You look fabulous, Mrs. J.

02:39.355 --> 02:41.689
I'd ask you out myself,
but I'd have to

02:41.691 --> 02:43.824
fight off Larry Segel.

02:43.826 --> 02:45.676
Thank you.

02:45.678 --> 02:48.029
Hello.

02:55.154 --> 02:58.289
Robbie, I got
to take off early.

03:02.761 --> 03:07.515
Joey's engaged to a girl
named Pia Moresco.

03:07.517 --> 03:10.217
She waited six years for him
while he was deployed.

03:10.219 --> 03:13.721
Yeah, come here.

03:13.723 --> 03:16.524
I love you, Joey.

03:30.989 --> 03:32.373
Hey, Finch.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.874
Finch, are you there?

03:33.876 --> 03:37.361
Yes. Is there a problem?

03:38.915 --> 03:41.048
What are you doing?

03:41.050 --> 03:42.533
Nothing.

03:42.535 --> 03:45.219
Thought you said
you'd never lie to me.

03:45.221 --> 03:47.825
What's the problem,
Mr. Reese?

03:47.860 --> 03:48.806
Our guy, Joe Durban...

03:48.808 --> 03:50.725
I've been on him for eight
hours, and all he's done

03:50.727 --> 03:52.009
is open doors for old ladies,

03:52.011 --> 03:53.761
and now he's
going window shopping.

03:53.763 --> 03:55.396
If the machine's
given us his number,

03:55.398 --> 03:57.214
he must be caught up
in something.

03:57.216 --> 03:59.716
He got a text,
it's a bit garbled.

03:59.718 --> 04:00.684
Sending it over.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.105
- "Anchor D-0."

04:04.107 --> 04:05.556
This supposed
to mean something?

04:05.558 --> 04:06.907
I don't know.

04:06.909 --> 04:08.225
You're the genius.

04:34.187 --> 04:35.352
Get down, get down.
You, open the door now!

04:35.354 --> 04:37.921
Go! Go!

04:37.923 --> 04:40.558
- Get down!
- Get on the ground!

04:40.560 --> 04:43.227
Down, down to the ground!
You, open the door. Now.

04:43.229 --> 04:45.146
I said, "get down."

04:47.765 --> 04:48.899
Head down.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.901
50 seconds!

04:52.037 --> 04:56.040
Head down.
Don't look at me.

04:58.611 --> 05:00.044
40 seconds!

05:02.497 --> 05:04.165
Not a good idea, pal.

05:06.084 --> 05:08.252
30 seconds!

05:11.756 --> 05:14.809
Wrap it up!

05:15.844 --> 05:19.063
10 seconds, Sierra. Move!

05:19.065 --> 05:21.182
Sierra, move!

05:21.184 --> 05:23.818
Enough!

05:35.413 --> 05:37.147
I'm back, Mr. Reese.

05:37.149 --> 05:38.982
I've deciphered that text--
It's a street address...

05:38.984 --> 05:40.734
For a bank.

05:40.736 --> 05:42.169
No kidding, Finch.

05:42.171 --> 05:45.989
What I said about
our guy being boring--

05:45.991 --> 05:49.826
I take it back.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.596
Ladies and gentlemen,
please do not

06:03.598 --> 06:05.431
leave bags unattended.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.498
Unattended bags will be...

06:06.500 --> 06:08.167
John.

06:09.604 --> 06:13.839
I didn't know you were back
from over there.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.442
Jessica.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.511
I'm not.
I'm just...

06:19.513 --> 06:21.180
Heading back, actually.

06:21.182 --> 06:23.115
- Where's your uniform?
- Uh...

06:23.117 --> 06:25.034
I got a new job.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.987
One of those jobs
you can't talk about?

06:39.883 --> 06:42.635
So our friend Joey's
a bank robber.

06:42.637 --> 06:44.804
Is that why the machine
gave us Joey's number?

06:44.806 --> 06:47.173
I built the machine
to look for lethal intent.

06:47.175 --> 06:50.309
Armed robbery wouldn't
normally make the cut.

06:50.311 --> 06:53.262
Either way, I say we gift wrap
him and give him to the NYPD

06:53.264 --> 06:55.731
before someone winds up dead.

06:55.733 --> 06:57.399
Finch, the guy
was a good soldier.

06:57.401 --> 07:00.236
Let me at least find out
how he got into this mess.

07:00.238 --> 07:01.520
Okay, but don't
let your personal feelings

07:01.522 --> 07:03.072
warp your judgment.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.441
No one forced him
to go robbing banks.

07:05.443 --> 07:07.860
Hang on, hang on.
He's meeting someone.

07:09.279 --> 07:10.696
He's giving her something.

07:10.698 --> 07:14.867
Looks like money--
A lot of money.

07:27.965 --> 07:31.767
So...
Who's the other woman?

07:31.769 --> 07:34.406
I don't know her name yet.

07:35.356 --> 07:36.640
Bank robber and a cheet.

07:36.641 --> 07:40.342
Unlikely to have
a happy ending.

07:40.344 --> 07:43.195
- Do you think he's targeting
one of the women? - Could be.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.429
Only way I'm going to find out

07:44.431 --> 07:45.597
is to get closer to Joey,

07:45.599 --> 07:48.150
and that won't be easy.

07:48.152 --> 07:50.202
These guys are organized
and ultra-cautious.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.571
No unnecessary contact.

07:52.679 --> 07:53.412
Thanks.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.325
Hang on.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.698
That cabbie was at the bank.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.667
Just made their courier.

08:04.669 --> 08:05.668
Finch, run a check

08:05.670 --> 08:08.254
on cab medallion number
5-Victor-80.

08:08.256 --> 08:11.507
- Driver's name is Willis,
also an ex-soldier

08:11.509 --> 08:12.925
in the 107th infantry.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.426
Same unit as Joey.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.011
And also a bank robber.

08:16.013 --> 08:18.514
I hacked
the taxi company website.

08:18.516 --> 08:20.316
Before he dropped the cash
off with Joey,

08:20.318 --> 08:21.851
Willis stopped at a bar
in Coney Island

08:21.853 --> 08:23.185
called the Green Zone.

08:23.187 --> 08:27.857
Bar's owned by former
master Sergeant Sam Latimer,

08:27.859 --> 08:29.158
veteran of the First Gulf War.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.861
I think you just found
the gang's ringleader.

08:32.864 --> 08:35.414
I want to get close to Latimer.

08:35.416 --> 08:36.866
And I'll need a cover story.

08:36.868 --> 08:38.017
I'll get on that.

08:38.019 --> 08:40.568
And I need you
to create a vacancy for me...

08:40.571 --> 08:42.171
With the gang.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.757
I'll get on that too.

08:44.759 --> 08:46.592
Anything else?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.660
No, that'll do for now.

09:05.061 --> 09:07.229
You Sam Latimer?

09:08.815 --> 09:10.032
Name's Tony Miller.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.371
Marine buddy down in San Diego,

09:15.373 --> 09:17.072
told me a while back,

09:17.074 --> 09:18.407
if I was ever in New York,

09:18.409 --> 09:19.541
I should look you up.

09:19.543 --> 09:20.492
What's your buddy's name?

09:20.494 --> 09:23.028
Hector Muñoz.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.863
Muñoz, yeah,
I remember him from Mogadishu.

09:24.865 --> 09:25.998
Good shooter.
How's he doing?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.466
Not good.

09:27.468 --> 09:29.551
Ran over an IED in Hellmans.

09:29.553 --> 09:32.171
Lasted a whole week before
he hit room temperature.

09:32.173 --> 09:33.339
Rest in peace.

09:33.341 --> 09:35.507
Tough son of a bitch.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.725
So...

09:36.727 --> 09:38.477
What kind of work are you
looking for? Security?

09:38.479 --> 09:41.897
I'm not looking for wages.

09:41.899 --> 09:43.682
I'm only interested
in lump sums.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.100
You in trouble?

09:45.102 --> 09:46.986
That's my business.

09:46.988 --> 09:48.654
You're making it mine.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.057
I was working freelance
in Tijuana.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.410
Job went South.
People's feelings got hurt.

09:54.412 --> 09:57.746
I need to put some distance
between me and them.

09:58.915 --> 10:02.401
I've got some experience
you could use-- Skills.

10:02.403 --> 10:03.619
What kind of skills?

10:03.621 --> 10:06.672
You have a .45
under the counter,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.073
a shotgun next to the register,

10:08.075 --> 10:10.175
and I can get to them both
before you.

10:12.963 --> 10:14.763
So if you're such a hotshot,

10:14.765 --> 10:15.965
what do you need me for?

10:15.967 --> 10:19.251
I prefer to work with people
who know the area.

10:19.253 --> 10:21.103
I heard you're good
at what you do--

10:21.105 --> 10:25.357
You make a lot of money...
You're still alive.

10:25.359 --> 10:26.692
And that's because
I prefer not to work with a man

10:26.694 --> 10:29.311
whose only reference
is a dead marine.

10:34.818 --> 10:37.720
Well...

10:37.722 --> 10:40.622
There's no job openings
at the moment.

10:40.624 --> 10:41.790
But I'll call around.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.960
Thanks.
You won't regret it.

10:44.962 --> 10:46.829
I know.

10:51.617 --> 10:52.718
Hey, uh, keep the change.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.220
Let me get my case
out of the trunk.

11:22.616 --> 11:25.034
Yellow cab driver,
get out of your vehicle!

11:26.753 --> 11:29.254
Get out of your vehicle!
Now!

11:29.256 --> 11:30.723
We got weapons here--

11:30.725 --> 11:32.491
Shotgun, submachine guns.

11:32.493 --> 11:34.209
I don't know anything
about those.

11:34.211 --> 11:37.463
Those are not mine!

11:40.517 --> 11:42.267
You Carter?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.436
- Yeah.
- Molina-- Robbery.

11:44.438 --> 11:47.506
I hear you're chasing after some
mysterious special forces guy.

11:47.508 --> 11:49.174
Yeah, what is it to you?

11:49.176 --> 11:52.194
Come here.
I may have something for you.

11:52.196 --> 11:55.514
His prints showed up
on a bank job yesterday.

11:55.516 --> 11:56.732
On a bank job?

11:56.734 --> 11:59.701
Yeah. Four armed guys knocked
over a bank on Houston.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.074
See that guard there?

12:05.076 --> 12:06.875
Tries to be a hero.
Someone stops him

12:06.877 --> 12:08.243
from getting
his head blown off.

12:11.214 --> 12:12.697
When CSU did elimination prints

12:12.699 --> 12:15.117
they printed
the guard's holster.

12:15.119 --> 12:16.201
It was your mystery man.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.087
Well, did they stop him?
Interview him?

12:18.089 --> 12:20.139
No, he slipped away before
the first units got there.

12:20.141 --> 12:21.390
Of course.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.930
See the way
these guys are moving?

12:30.517 --> 12:33.769
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure
that's a milspec radio.

12:33.771 --> 12:35.720
They're soldiers.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.323
So your special forces guy
fits right in.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.659
I mean, he--
He could be their inside man.

12:40.661 --> 12:43.278
Mind if I keep this?

12:43.280 --> 12:46.014
Looks like your taxi ride
paid off, Finch.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.117
Latimer just called me.

12:48.119 --> 12:51.036
He wants me to meet
the team...Tonight.

13:15.361 --> 13:19.148
Come on.
Move, move.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.588
What we got, Straub?

13:42.590 --> 13:44.789
- ID checks out.
Pay-as-you-go cell phone

13:44.791 --> 13:45.841
bought two days ago.

13:45.843 --> 13:47.392
Ran the calls--
Mainly take-out,

13:47.394 --> 13:49.228
couple to some jarheads
in San Diego.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.646
Last call's from Latimer.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.853
What the hell is this about?

13:57.855 --> 13:59.488
I thought Latimer
wanted you to meet me.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.073
He also told us to put
a bullet in your head

14:01.075 --> 14:03.075
if we didn't like you.
And right now, we don't.

14:08.831 --> 14:12.417
- I'm just an ex-soldier,
needs some money fast.

14:15.171 --> 14:17.539
You don't trust me?
Fine.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.658
But the 107 trusted me
back in '05,

14:19.660 --> 14:21.343
in Tikrit, and I trusted them.

14:21.345 --> 14:23.178
How the hell
do you know our unit?

14:24.514 --> 14:27.766
Big fella's got it tattooed
all over his arm.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.458
You don't call us.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.743
We call you.

14:54.745 --> 14:56.712
When we do...

14:56.714 --> 14:58.330
You lose that phone.

15:07.258 --> 15:10.092
Killing in battle,

15:10.094 --> 15:11.893
in combat, is one thing.

15:11.895 --> 15:14.930
Killing someone up close...

15:14.932 --> 15:17.432
Someone who can't fight back,

15:17.434 --> 15:21.270
that takes a different
sort of killer.

15:21.272 --> 15:23.238
And Joey's not one of them.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.324
So you think Joey's the target.

15:25.326 --> 15:27.242
Then who's gunning for him?

15:27.244 --> 15:31.396
One of the gang?
One of the women?

15:31.398 --> 15:35.450
Do we even know why
he's such a mess?

15:35.452 --> 15:37.119
He's got a job,
pretty girlfriend,

15:37.121 --> 15:38.954
good service record--
He's throwing it all away.

15:38.956 --> 15:40.122
He's going to end up in prison.

15:40.124 --> 15:43.375
- Or dead.
- You're right, but,

15:45.077 --> 15:49.298
not every ex-soldier meets
a reclusive billionaire.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.219
Okay.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.920
But if Joey's bad choices

15:55.922 --> 15:58.056
mean he's about
to walk into a bullet,

15:58.058 --> 16:01.693
we have to find out
who's firing it.

16:09.565 --> 16:10.849
Excuse me.

16:10.851 --> 16:12.601
- Hey.
- I'm looking for my girlfriend.

16:12.603 --> 16:14.486
What are you doing here?

16:14.488 --> 16:15.554
Just wanted to say hello
to the most beautiful girl

16:15.556 --> 16:16.621
in the world.

16:16.623 --> 16:17.722
You're gonna get me in trouble.

16:17.724 --> 16:19.858
Good tips today?

16:19.860 --> 16:21.443
Not bad.

16:21.445 --> 16:23.845
Julie's out sick,
so I got her tables.

16:23.847 --> 16:25.030
It's been busy.

16:25.032 --> 16:27.533
You better
get back to your shift.

16:27.534 --> 16:29.384
Okay.
Oh, before you go,

16:29.586 --> 16:31.870
Realtor says she can shome
some apartments tonight.

16:31.872 --> 16:33.922
I'd really like it
if you can see them with me.

16:33.924 --> 16:36.258
Things are kind of difficult
at work right now.

16:36.260 --> 16:40.012
I know, baby,
but this is important too.

16:40.014 --> 16:42.297
I just want us
to do stuff together again.

16:42.299 --> 16:44.716
Like have fun.
Remember that?

16:44.718 --> 16:47.919
I'm trying, P.
I really am.

16:57.763 --> 17:02.200
John, I didn't know
you were back from over there.

17:04.954 --> 17:07.039
- Where's your uniform?
- Uh...

17:07.040 --> 17:08.957
I got a new job.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.910
One of those jobs
you can't talk about?

17:14.664 --> 17:17.049
Oh, yeah, I got engaged.

17:17.050 --> 17:21.086
I'm-- I'm moving
back east next month.

17:21.088 --> 17:22.838
His name's Peter.

17:24.057 --> 17:28.343
Peter.
He's a lucky guy.

17:29.512 --> 17:32.564
I waited for you.

17:32.566 --> 17:34.799
- I didn't ask you to.
- No.

17:34.801 --> 17:36.435
No, you didn't.

17:36.437 --> 17:38.353
You just...Left.

17:38.355 --> 17:40.739
Because you thought
you'd get killed over there,

17:40.741 --> 17:42.474
and that that would hurt me.

17:44.494 --> 17:47.028
But I think the truth is that

17:47.030 --> 17:48.997
it was easier for you
to be alone.

17:48.999 --> 17:51.249
That's one of the things
you learn over there--

17:51.251 --> 17:54.252
In the end, we're all alone.

17:54.254 --> 17:57.339
And no one's coming
to save you.

18:00.676 --> 18:04.713
Be happy with Peter.

18:12.622 --> 18:15.173
Oh, Molina, I want to know
more about this gang.

18:15.175 --> 18:17.675
They pulled about
a dozen robberies.

18:17.677 --> 18:20.362
They hit banks, jewelry stores,

18:20.364 --> 18:22.314
money exchanges, casinos.

18:22.316 --> 18:23.648
It's always four armed men.

18:23.650 --> 18:24.816
They haven't killed anyone.

18:24.818 --> 18:25.867
They haven't even hurt anyone.

18:25.869 --> 18:28.120
In and out in 60 seconds,
every time.

18:28.122 --> 18:30.238
- Dozen robberies. They're good.
- Oh, yeah.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.374
A gang like this, they usually
implode after four or five.

18:32.376 --> 18:33.909
You know how
they start dropping money,

18:33.911 --> 18:35.293
they have a falling out
with each other?

18:35.295 --> 18:36.912
Not these guys.

18:36.914 --> 18:39.381
Maybe this will help.

18:39.383 --> 18:41.800
It's a 148 radio--
Painted black,

18:41.802 --> 18:43.969
aerial cut down
to look more like a phone.

18:43.971 --> 18:46.555
It uses frequency-hopping
spread spectrum.

18:46.557 --> 18:48.723
Which means zero chance
of interception.

18:48.725 --> 18:50.542
You know this how?

18:50.544 --> 18:52.210
I used them...

18:52.212 --> 18:54.012
In Iraq and Afghanistan.

18:57.550 --> 18:59.017
Where do I get one of these?

18:59.019 --> 19:00.101
You can't.

19:00.103 --> 19:02.070
Got to steal them
from the military.

19:02.072 --> 19:04.406
I checked with every base
on the east coast.

19:04.408 --> 19:06.024
Fort drum reported the theft

19:06.026 --> 19:07.409
of a radio package
six months ago.

19:07.411 --> 19:09.894
Do they got any idea
who stole them?

19:09.896 --> 19:11.830
Army CID investigated--
No joy.

19:11.832 --> 19:14.416
I'll tell you what you can do.

19:14.418 --> 19:16.201
Cross-check guys
resident in New York,

19:16.203 --> 19:17.285
who left the service
out of Fort Drum

19:17.287 --> 19:18.420
in the last six months.

19:18.422 --> 19:20.288
12 robberies--

19:20.290 --> 19:23.542
Must have
some physical descriptions.

19:39.859 --> 19:41.610
How was school?

19:46.449 --> 19:48.766
Thanks.

19:48.768 --> 19:49.868
Hi, sweetie.

19:49.870 --> 19:52.370
Hey, Finch.
I'm sending you a photo.

19:52.372 --> 19:54.923
Looks like Joey's other woman's
got a little girl.

19:54.925 --> 19:57.375
Think she's Joey's?

19:57.377 --> 19:59.611
Sure looks like that.

19:59.613 --> 20:01.913
You should be able to find
the girl's name,

20:01.915 --> 20:03.298
if Sunny Days Kindergarten's
firewalls

20:03.300 --> 20:06.001
aren't too tough for you.

20:06.003 --> 20:08.587
- And why don't you arrange
a little face-time with Joey,

20:08.589 --> 20:10.755
Mr. Reese?

20:16.546 --> 20:18.930
I thought you said no contact.

20:18.932 --> 20:21.466
What are you doing?
Following me?

20:21.468 --> 20:23.568
I live here, pal.
What's your excuse?

20:23.570 --> 20:26.771
I'm staying in a fleapit
on Colby.

20:26.773 --> 20:30.025
This one's on me...

20:30.027 --> 20:33.662
But I'm, uh, running
a little low on funds.

20:34.914 --> 20:36.615
How long before
we get some action?

20:36.617 --> 20:38.033
That's up to Latimer.

20:38.035 --> 20:40.151
We just follow orders.

20:40.153 --> 20:42.820
Orders-- Don't you ever
get sick of them?

20:42.822 --> 20:46.508
Maybe.
But they make life simple.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.177
Told to go down that road,
you go down that road.

20:49.179 --> 20:50.762
Yeah, you're told
to go into that bank,

20:50.764 --> 20:55.467
you go into that bank, right?

20:55.469 --> 20:56.518
I don't know, man.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.837
Six years,
all I thought about--

20:59.839 --> 21:01.640
Dreamed about--

21:01.642 --> 21:03.608
was coming home.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.727
Finally I come home
and there's nothing.

21:05.729 --> 21:07.395
There's no money,
no jobs--

21:07.397 --> 21:10.115
Bankers gone and lost it all.

21:10.117 --> 21:12.367
Robbed the country blind.
I mean, it's like,

21:12.369 --> 21:13.618
what the hell
are we fighting for, you know?

21:13.620 --> 21:15.820
Joke's on us.

21:15.822 --> 21:17.355
Hey!

21:17.357 --> 21:18.590
You guys were soldiers, right?

21:18.592 --> 21:20.408
What like Iraq, Afghanistan?

21:20.410 --> 21:21.543
Some serious stuff.

21:21.545 --> 21:23.161
Yeah, but you volunteered.

21:23.163 --> 21:24.362
Nobody asked you to go.

21:24.364 --> 21:26.331
It's not like
the country owes you a living.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.532
- We got it, pal.
- No.

21:27.534 --> 21:29.050
You don't "got it"--

21:29.052 --> 21:31.386
Talking about bankers,
like you know anything.

21:31.388 --> 21:34.089
It's not been easy
for us either.

21:34.091 --> 21:36.841
Really sorry about that,
but we're talking here.

21:36.843 --> 21:38.727
Hey, so are we.

21:38.729 --> 21:41.730
Guys like you got to adapt.

21:41.732 --> 21:43.398
It's the knowledge economy now.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.685
Time to use this, my friend.

21:47.503 --> 21:49.354
Okay.

21:49.356 --> 21:50.739
Hey!

21:51.942 --> 21:53.358
All right, come on.
Let's go.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.442
Sorry, Bill.

21:54.444 --> 21:57.362
What made you start
on the banks?

21:57.364 --> 21:59.014
Realized the job that I had

21:59.016 --> 22:01.950
wasn't going to allow me
to do the things that I wanted.

22:02.918 --> 22:05.086
I had a debt to pay.

22:05.088 --> 22:07.622
- Money?
- More like an obligation.

22:07.624 --> 22:09.290
Oh.

22:09.292 --> 22:10.542
You got kids?

22:10.544 --> 22:12.577
No.

22:12.579 --> 22:13.928
Why do you say that?

22:13.930 --> 22:15.680
I was just asking.

22:15.682 --> 22:16.998
What about the rest
of the guys?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.049
They got debts too?

22:18.051 --> 22:21.436
Straub does.

22:21.438 --> 22:22.771
Gambling.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.639
Is that why Straub's so jumpy?

22:24.641 --> 22:27.976
You'd be jumpy too,
you got blown up twice.

22:27.978 --> 22:29.527
Listen, man,
I got to get to work.

22:29.529 --> 22:32.447
Wait for the call.

22:36.602 --> 22:38.603
Any luck ID'ing that woman?

22:38.605 --> 22:41.823
Kindergarten records say
the girl is Amy Myles,

22:41.825 --> 22:43.908
daughter of Stacey Myles.

22:43.910 --> 22:45.443
Father's name not given.

22:45.445 --> 22:47.445
I'm checking hospital records.
What about you?

22:47.447 --> 22:49.664
I'm going to check
on someone else--

22:49.666 --> 22:51.750
A guy named Straub.

22:58.474 --> 22:59.641
Strauby, what gives?

22:59.643 --> 23:01.893
We made you nearly 80 grand
last job.

23:01.895 --> 23:03.178
I got five--
It's not enough.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.897
Well, you know how it is.
I had to clean the money.

23:05.899 --> 23:07.599
That's a big, heavy discount
right there.

23:07.601 --> 23:09.434
Now, you guys made 20 grand--
I made less than than that.

23:09.436 --> 23:11.403
People I owe, they're going to
take away my mom's apartment.

23:11.405 --> 23:13.071
They said one of the paper's
I signed,

23:13.073 --> 23:14.222
- it gives them the right.
- Man, I told you

23:14.224 --> 23:15.573
- to stay away from the sharks.
- Yeah, well,

23:15.575 --> 23:16.775
I didn't have
much choice then, did I?

23:16.777 --> 23:17.859
I need more money.

23:17.861 --> 23:20.745
Listen, I got a job for you...

23:20.747 --> 23:22.247
Tonight.

23:22.249 --> 23:23.415
Now, if you do this right,

23:23.417 --> 23:24.532
there's a big score
coming down--

23:24.534 --> 23:26.367
- 400 grand big.
- You're kidding.

23:26.369 --> 23:28.420
Big client, big job.

23:28.422 --> 23:30.371
200 for me and 200 for you.

23:30.373 --> 23:32.006
Yeah, 200 divided four ways.

23:32.008 --> 23:36.094
Come here.
Come on.

23:37.046 --> 23:39.380
My friend, how you divvy up

23:39.382 --> 23:40.515
is your business.

23:40.517 --> 23:43.167
With this job,
you can pay off all your debt...

23:43.169 --> 23:46.387
Join Manny and Danny
in the land of tequila

23:46.389 --> 23:47.722
and grateful señoritas.

23:47.724 --> 23:50.225
You remember Danny Platt?

23:50.227 --> 23:53.812
Manny Santos? Guys worked hard--
Did what they were told.

23:53.814 --> 23:55.280
And now they're enjoying
their retirement.

23:55.282 --> 23:59.067
Say we don't make it out
of one of these jobs.

23:59.069 --> 24:02.036
Say we take casualties.

24:02.038 --> 24:04.789
Still the same split, right?

24:04.791 --> 24:05.957
50/50 with you?

24:05.959 --> 24:08.042
Sure.

24:09.612 --> 24:11.579
But you guys are going
to make it out.

24:11.581 --> 24:14.249
You're a unit--
Team.

24:21.206 --> 24:26.261
Hey, Carter. I followed up
on your radio lead.

24:26.263 --> 24:29.063
Teddy Dalloway--
6'2",

24:29.065 --> 24:31.549
220 pounds, discharged
from the army five months ago.

24:31.551 --> 24:33.434
A big guy, but that's not
what gave him away.

24:36.155 --> 24:38.106
He's left-handed.

24:38.108 --> 24:40.108
Yep, we've got
a GPS lock on his phone.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.943
See if he leads us
to the rest of the gang.

24:41.945 --> 24:44.696
Uh, look, if, uh,
Teddy makes a move,

24:44.698 --> 24:47.282
you call me.
I don't care what time.

24:52.121 --> 24:54.372
Hey, Finch, just got the call.

24:54.374 --> 24:55.673
Gang's picking me up.

24:55.675 --> 24:58.209
Get told the target en route.

24:58.211 --> 24:59.427
You're not going in with them?

24:59.429 --> 25:00.929
Got to watch Joey's back.

25:00.931 --> 25:03.431
Don't trust his friend Straub
one bit.

25:03.433 --> 25:06.250
I did not understand
"infiltrate the gang" to mean

25:06.252 --> 25:08.686
- join them in their robberies.
- No choice.

25:08.688 --> 25:11.189
I'll keep the line open.

25:11.191 --> 25:12.891
Monitor the police band for me.

25:17.563 --> 25:20.148
Here.

25:20.150 --> 25:22.867
Why the heavy artillery?

25:22.869 --> 25:24.452
Target's a mob gambling joint,
445 Mulvaney.

25:24.454 --> 25:27.238
People inside
guaranteed to be packing.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.457
ETA, 60 seconds.
Phones off,

25:29.459 --> 25:31.709
batteries out,
radio comms only.

25:33.229 --> 25:36.965
- Hey.
- Tracked Teddy Dalloway's GPS.

25:36.967 --> 25:39.467
He left Brooklyn 20 minutes ago,
in some kind of vehicle.

25:39.469 --> 25:41.052
He did three pick-ups.

25:41.054 --> 25:42.670
It's the gang.
Know where they're heading?

25:42.672 --> 25:43.972
Somewhere around here.

25:58.038 --> 25:59.604
Get back against the wall!

25:59.606 --> 26:00.688
Against the wall!
Put the money down!

26:00.690 --> 26:02.273
Back against the wall!

26:02.275 --> 26:03.641
Back! Back! Go! Go!

26:03.643 --> 26:05.577
- Gonna call back up.
- Do that.

26:05.579 --> 26:07.328
Back! Back! Back! Back!

26:07.330 --> 26:09.197
Put it down!

26:09.199 --> 26:12.450
- Put the money down! Down!
- Reese, NYPD dispatch.

26:12.452 --> 26:15.086
Just received a back up call
for that address.

26:17.539 --> 26:21.376
John, NYPD is on route.

26:21.378 --> 26:23.678
- Do you hear me?
- We got to move out!

26:23.680 --> 26:25.830
- Cops are coming!
- How the hell do <i>you</i> know?

26:25.832 --> 26:27.932
Police band.
They have our address.

26:29.969 --> 26:31.219
We gotta move.
Leave the money.

26:31.221 --> 26:32.604
- I'm not going.
- Leave the money,

26:32.606 --> 26:34.505
- we gotta move!
- No way! I'm not leaving.

26:34.507 --> 26:35.757
That's it. Move! Now!

26:37.894 --> 26:39.193
Move! Move!

26:39.195 --> 26:41.062
- Everyone over!
- Move across!

26:46.452 --> 26:47.735
I don't hear any damn cops!

26:47.737 --> 26:49.487
We left like 100 grand
up there!

26:49.489 --> 26:50.688
Hear 'em now, Straub?

26:50.690 --> 26:52.957
Damn lucky for us
he was listening in.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.325
Come on, let's go.
This way.

26:54.327 --> 26:56.778
Let's move.

26:59.665 --> 27:02.583
Nobody move!

27:12.624 --> 27:13.841
I don't know what happened--

27:13.843 --> 27:15.542
We hardly got in there
before the cops were on us.

27:15.444 --> 27:17.411
Joey and the new guy,
they said to leave the money.

27:17.513 --> 27:18.846
Yeah, how thoughtful of them.

27:18.848 --> 27:20.547
You guys let me down, Straub.

27:20.549 --> 27:21.665
Well, I'll make it up to you.

27:21.667 --> 27:22.666
You got to give us
another chance, all right?

27:22.668 --> 27:25.302
Okay, one more--
The big one.

27:25.304 --> 27:26.970
Can you tell me what it is?

27:26.972 --> 27:28.438
In good time.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.340
And keep an eye on the new guy.

27:30.342 --> 27:32.276
You might need him
going in--

27:32.278 --> 27:33.777
Not sure you're going
to need him coming out.

27:35.046 --> 27:36.280
Now how can we wrap this up?

27:36.282 --> 27:37.447
It can't go on, John.

27:37.449 --> 27:38.365
Somebody's going to get killed.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.234
Let me talk to Joey first.

27:40.236 --> 27:41.585
To what end?

27:41.587 --> 27:43.520
I want to find out
what his guilt trip is.

27:43.522 --> 27:45.021
Try to cure him of it.

27:45.023 --> 27:48.125
Might be more complicated
than you think.

27:48.127 --> 27:50.627
I got
into Joey's bank accounts--

27:50.629 --> 27:52.246
Last four months, he's paid

27:52.248 --> 27:55.031
nearly $10,000
into a 529 savings plan

27:55.033 --> 27:56.750
for the little girl, Amy Myles.

27:56.752 --> 27:58.919
It'll pay for her
to go to college.

27:58.921 --> 28:02.205
Amy has to be Joey's kid.

28:02.207 --> 28:03.473
But she's not.

28:03.475 --> 28:04.892
Hospital records show

28:04.894 --> 28:08.529
that her daddy was called
Frank Stephens.

28:08.531 --> 28:09.663
"Was."

28:09.665 --> 28:11.765
Killed in Afghanistan.

28:11.767 --> 28:14.268
He was a soldier in the 107th.

28:14.270 --> 28:15.652
Same unit as Joey.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.169
We're going to meet
in five hours.

28:32.171 --> 28:33.737
It's a new job.

28:33.739 --> 28:36.456
You're going
to risk it all again?

28:36.458 --> 28:38.258
You know Straub's
going off the rails.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.410
Well, yeah. That's why
I gotta have his back.

28:40.412 --> 28:42.078
He needs the money.

28:42.080 --> 28:46.049
Uh, Straub might.
But you don't.

28:46.051 --> 28:48.385
Yeah, I do.

28:50.638 --> 28:53.190
That's right...

28:53.192 --> 28:55.359
Your "obligation."

28:55.361 --> 28:57.861
What is that?

28:57.863 --> 29:01.565
You leave someone behind?

29:01.567 --> 29:04.534
Who was it, Joey?

29:04.536 --> 29:06.870
A friend.

29:06.872 --> 29:10.240
Took my place on patrol.

29:10.242 --> 29:12.826
Got killed.

29:12.828 --> 29:16.113
Why'd he take your place?

29:16.115 --> 29:21.084
LT puts me on honor guard
for this visiting politician...

29:21.086 --> 29:23.003
So I'm scrubbing my boots,

29:23.005 --> 29:25.422
and Frank-- That was his
name-- Frank goes out.

29:25.424 --> 29:28.892
His wife had just had a baby.

29:28.894 --> 29:31.127
This little girl called Amy.

29:31.129 --> 29:37.067
He was so happy,
he said nothing could hurt him.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.969
IED rips him to pieces

29:38.971 --> 29:41.438
in the seat
I should have been sitting in.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.690
So that's your debt?

29:43.692 --> 29:48.028
Yeah. He used to show me
her picture, you know?

29:48.030 --> 29:50.447
He was going to lay the world
at her feet, man.

29:50.449 --> 29:53.316
Was going to give her money
for college, everything.

29:53.318 --> 29:54.668
And he would have
done that too.

29:54.670 --> 29:55.953
He would have done it.

29:55.955 --> 29:58.455
And that's what
you're going to do.

30:00.541 --> 30:02.042
You tell anyone else?

30:02.044 --> 30:06.013
No, not even my girlfriend.

30:06.998 --> 30:09.332
So you're still
fighting the war.

30:09.334 --> 30:11.268
She's still waiting.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.270
When this is done...

30:13.272 --> 30:16.139
I'm with her completely.

30:17.141 --> 30:20.610
Be with her now.

30:20.612 --> 30:26.483
Don't do the job.

30:26.485 --> 30:29.369
My friend got killed.

30:29.371 --> 30:33.373
Got to take care of his kid.

30:45.136 --> 30:46.303
It's Pia, right?

30:46.305 --> 30:48.638
Yeah.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.724
You're even prettier
than Joey said.

30:50.726 --> 30:52.843
You're a friend of Joey's?

30:52.845 --> 30:56.179
Army. Just in New York
for a few days.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.517
He's crazy about you,
you know that?

31:00.519 --> 31:02.402
It's funny how his friends
know more

31:02.404 --> 31:03.653
about what he's feeling
than I do.

31:03.655 --> 31:04.855
Well, you know, Joey's a...

31:04.857 --> 31:07.607
Bit of a closed book.

31:07.609 --> 31:11.745
You're telling me.

31:11.747 --> 31:14.614
Starting to wonder
if he's ever going to let me in.

31:14.616 --> 31:16.833
Waited six years for him
to come home,

31:16.835 --> 31:19.086
and it's like
he's still over there.

31:21.706 --> 31:23.740
Sorry.

31:23.742 --> 31:25.459
Shouldn't go crying
all over the customers.

31:25.461 --> 31:27.044
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's all right.

31:27.046 --> 31:30.464
Look, you're a beautiful woman.

31:30.466 --> 31:32.933
If Joey doesn't come
to his senses,

31:32.935 --> 31:36.386
plenty more fish in the sea.

31:38.089 --> 31:40.223
No, I'm stuck with him.

31:40.225 --> 31:42.859
Loved him since I was so high.

31:45.029 --> 31:50.700
That's the way it is.

31:50.702 --> 31:53.436
Are you there, Mr. Reese?

31:53.438 --> 31:55.572
Get anywhere
with your friend, Joey?

31:55.574 --> 31:58.425
No. Can't cure someone
of guilt.

31:58.427 --> 32:00.961
Soon as I find out
what the next job is,

32:00.963 --> 32:03.080
go ahead and call the cops.

32:03.082 --> 32:04.965
They can pull
the whole gang in.

32:04.967 --> 32:07.050
You did what you could.

32:07.052 --> 32:10.554
Yep.

32:11.556 --> 32:12.956
I got something for you.

32:12.958 --> 32:16.259
Ex-soldiers--
Manny Santos, Danny Platt.

32:16.261 --> 32:19.012
Both murdered.
Shot in the head.

32:19.014 --> 32:20.764
This is from three months ago.

32:20.766 --> 32:22.182
What made you look at it?

32:22.184 --> 32:24.935
I cross-checked CSU reports
for the last six months--

32:24.937 --> 32:27.020
military hardware items.

32:27.022 --> 32:29.272
And look what came up--

32:30.274 --> 32:33.660
148 radio.
Serial number still legible.

32:33.662 --> 32:35.812
One of the radios
stolen from Fort Drum.

32:35.814 --> 32:38.982
It means Santos and Platt
were robbers too.

32:38.984 --> 32:41.317
It explains why
your gang keeps going,

32:41.319 --> 32:42.702
why they don't fall out.

32:42.704 --> 32:46.089
Once they've done four or five
jobs, someone bumps them off,

32:46.091 --> 32:47.707
recruits some new suckers.

32:47.709 --> 32:50.794
Yeah, but who?

32:53.965 --> 32:56.683
They have the target, sir.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.136
Long-term evidence lockup
under Centre Street.

32:59.138 --> 33:00.387
Police headquarters.

33:00.389 --> 33:01.888
They have the cage number,

33:01.890 --> 33:05.175
precise orders
to recover the item.

33:05.177 --> 33:07.527
Security's light--
Four semi-retired cops.

33:07.529 --> 33:09.479
Bad news--
It's right on Centre Street.

33:09.481 --> 33:11.014
It's crawling
with cops and feds.

33:11.016 --> 33:12.015
What are we stealing?

33:12.017 --> 33:13.183
One item only.

33:13.185 --> 33:15.068
Easily concealed,
so even you boy scouts

33:15.070 --> 33:16.186
won't make me leave it behind.

33:16.188 --> 33:17.737
Yeah, but what is it?
Bonds? Jewelry?

33:17.739 --> 33:19.873
Don't know, don't care,
but it's worth 400 grand.

33:21.743 --> 33:23.660
What about exit strategy?

33:23.662 --> 33:25.295
Uh, that's in hand, sir.

33:25.297 --> 33:27.047
Boss says no loose ends.

33:27.049 --> 33:29.082
- Understood?
- Understood.

33:29.084 --> 33:32.052
The team was cracking up anyway.
It's time to refresh.

33:33.421 --> 33:35.589
Latimer gave us clean weapons.

33:37.975 --> 33:40.343
I want cell phones,
pagers, in here.

33:41.395 --> 33:42.879
Come on.

33:46.018 --> 33:48.902
Yeah, even your sneaky
little earwig.

33:48.904 --> 33:52.155
Hey, it's not a problem, is it?

34:21.801 --> 34:22.885
Get up! Get up!

34:22.887 --> 34:24.003
Right now! Get up!
Put your hands

34:24.005 --> 34:25.588
behind your back!
Move! Move! Move!

34:25.590 --> 34:28.040
Move.

34:28.042 --> 34:29.875
I called
from Marmostein Ribner--

34:29.877 --> 34:33.344
Some probate issues
on the Ulman Estate.

34:36.565 --> 34:39.184
Have you got a case number?

34:39.186 --> 34:40.518
Hands in the air!
This is a robbery!

34:40.521 --> 34:41.737
Get out here, now!

34:41.739 --> 34:43.688
Move!
Move it! You too.

34:43.690 --> 34:44.989
Go! Move!

34:44.992 --> 34:46.190
Move! Move!

34:47.393 --> 34:49.777
Move! Get on the ground!

34:53.116 --> 34:55.284
Watch the entrance.
Watch the door.

35:00.373 --> 35:02.341
8-2-5-7-6.

35:06.763 --> 35:08.881
5-7-5.

35:11.886 --> 35:14.753
- You... stop staring at me.
- Leave him.

35:14.755 --> 35:16.272
Not a problem.

35:16.274 --> 35:19.224
I said stop looking at me.

35:19.226 --> 35:21.226
Latimer set you up.
It's a trap.

35:22.529 --> 35:26.115
Sit down. Wait here.

35:26.117 --> 35:28.350
7, 5-7-5.

35:28.352 --> 35:31.103
- 8-2-5-7-7-3, this is it.
- All right, pull it.

35:31.105 --> 35:33.572
Pull it.
Pull it.

35:48.454 --> 35:49.755
Latimer screwed us.

35:49.757 --> 35:50.806
We got to get out of here.

35:50.808 --> 35:51.790
Won't let you pull
that crap again.

35:51.792 --> 35:57.513
Got it!
8-7-3-3-6.

35:57.515 --> 35:58.897
Now move.
This is a trap.

35:58.899 --> 36:03.068
How do you know,
maybe you're the trap.

36:03.070 --> 36:08.440
Point that thing at me again,
and I'll shoot you with it.

36:08.442 --> 36:11.360
Let's move.

36:15.665 --> 36:19.818
We got it.
Let's move.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.621
Let's go.

36:26.293 --> 36:31.096
Keep moving Teddy, I got you.

36:31.098 --> 36:32.798
Carter, I just got a call

36:32.800 --> 36:34.183
of a shooting at Centre Street,
evidence lock.

36:34.185 --> 36:35.434
Who called it in?

36:35.436 --> 36:37.136
Street cleaners saw four guys
go into the lockup,

36:37.138 --> 36:38.721
five minutes later,
shooting started.

36:38.723 --> 36:41.106
Same four guys
came running out.

36:41.108 --> 36:42.524
Getting you to the van, Teddy.

36:42.526 --> 36:43.842
Come on.

36:43.844 --> 36:46.512
Take him in the van.
I'll cover you.

36:47.615 --> 36:48.890
There you go.

36:53.204 --> 36:56.405
Did you get it?

37:02.528 --> 37:04.713
You're a good soldier, Strauby.

37:07.717 --> 37:08.717
Run!

37:13.040 --> 37:16.675
Damn weapon won't fire.

37:21.348 --> 37:22.881
Why didn't my weapon fire?

37:22.883 --> 37:24.983
Latimer must have ground down
the firing pins.

37:28.055 --> 37:30.222
Come on.
Let's go.

37:54.747 --> 38:00.519
The lockup's secured.

38:00.521 --> 38:02.254
As soon as the police ID
Straub or Teddy,

38:02.256 --> 38:03.439
they'll be on to you.

38:03.441 --> 38:05.574
You got to get out of the city.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.443
Go South or west.

38:07.445 --> 38:09.812
Here's a couple of grand
to keep you going.

38:09.814 --> 38:11.196
With your skills,
you'll find work.

38:11.198 --> 38:12.430
But go now.

38:12.432 --> 38:13.765
And don't look back.

38:13.767 --> 38:15.400
I can't.

38:15.402 --> 38:16.368
I can't, man.

38:16.370 --> 38:18.654
I have someone here.

38:18.656 --> 38:20.372
You stay here,
and you'll be looking at her

38:20.374 --> 38:24.710
from behind bars for 20 years.

38:24.712 --> 38:29.548
Call her and ask her
to go with you.

38:29.550 --> 38:31.834
She loves you, Joey.

38:31.836 --> 38:34.419
Just tell her it's gonna be
you and her now.

38:34.421 --> 38:37.622
Just you and her.

38:46.065 --> 38:50.068
Can you hear me?

38:50.070 --> 38:54.490
I think you can.

38:54.492 --> 38:57.727
Guess you're out there,
hiding in plain sight.

38:59.781 --> 39:01.814
I keep looking for you.

39:01.816 --> 39:06.836
I keep finding myself
in some bad situations.

39:10.173 --> 39:13.959
You could always stop
looking for me.

39:13.961 --> 39:16.095
Not an option.

39:16.097 --> 39:17.763
Now I've got two more bodies.

39:17.765 --> 39:21.834
I don't think
you killed those guys.

39:21.836 --> 39:24.687
But I think you know who did.

39:24.689 --> 39:27.223
I'll take care of it.

39:27.225 --> 39:29.475
Playing a dangerous game.

39:29.477 --> 39:32.010
And I'm not sure
I understand why.

39:32.012 --> 39:34.280
I've got my reasons.

39:34.282 --> 39:36.532
Maybe you do.

39:36.534 --> 39:39.452
But every killer I locked up
thought they had a good reason.

39:39.454 --> 39:41.203
And that is how this ends.

39:41.205 --> 39:43.856
Sooner or later,
I'll lock you up.

39:43.858 --> 39:48.411
Or find you bleeding out
somewhere.

39:48.413 --> 39:52.030
I will take my chances.

39:52.032 --> 39:55.200
I think I've told you
everything that I can remember.

40:02.976 --> 40:06.696
Detective, over here.

40:06.698 --> 40:12.985
Looks like this is all
they took.

40:14.404 --> 40:16.722
So you let
our bank robber get away.

40:16.724 --> 40:20.693
He paid his dues,
deserved a second chance.

40:20.695 --> 40:21.894
Then are we done?

40:21.896 --> 40:27.083
Not quite.

40:29.953 --> 40:35.091
I hope that's what you wanted.

40:42.015 --> 40:45.184
So we better talk money.

41:03.870 --> 41:06.872
Someone got here first.

41:06.874 --> 41:09.658
He's dead.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.994
Any idea who did it?

41:11.996 --> 41:14.964
The name on the evidence box
was Elias.

41:14.966 --> 41:16.715
That mean anything to you?

41:16.717 --> 41:19.385
No.

41:19.387 --> 41:21.504
I'd better look into it.

41:37.470 --> 41:40.573
Hey.

42:14.340 --> 42:20.112
The truth is that, it was
easier for you to be alone.

42:20.114 --> 42:23.148
That's one of the things
you learn over there.

42:23.150 --> 42:25.701
In the end, we're all alone.

42:25.703 --> 42:29.205
And no one's
coming to save you.

42:29.207 --> 42:31.207
Be happy with Peter.

42:31.209 --> 42:32.875
You don't believe that.

42:32.877 --> 42:36.912
Not really.

42:36.914 --> 42:39.882
You wanna be brave?

42:39.884 --> 42:42.985
Take a risk.

42:42.987 --> 42:46.805
Tell me to wait for you and...

42:46.807 --> 42:50.009
Say those words and I will.

43:00.320 --> 43:03.522
It would take real courage,
wouldn't it?

43:16.620 --> 43:20.372
Wait for me.

43:20.374 --> 43:21.874
Please.

43:23.986 --> 43:26.578
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
