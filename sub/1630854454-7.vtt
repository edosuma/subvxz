00:01.436 --> 00:02.741
<i>Previously on</i>
Alaska Daily...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.352
<i>Complaints have surfaced.</i>

00:04.352 --> 00:06.397
- We need to walk back the story.
- You do that, Rushmi, I walk.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.051
Stanley. Why are you here?

00:08.051 --> 00:09.792
Her name is Gloria Nanmac.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.228
It's a story about how

00:11.228 --> 00:13.665
the Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women crisis

00:13.665 --> 00:15.232
is being ignored.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.060
Roz, I want to put you
on a story with Eileen.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.062
- Why not just give
the whole story to me?
- It's my story.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.759
Do you know anything
about Alaska?

00:20.759 --> 00:21.978
Following the publication
of your stories,

00:21.978 --> 00:23.849
- Durkin was fired.
- So was Barnett.

00:23.849 --> 00:26.069
When you expose people,
do you worry about blowback?

00:26.069 --> 00:27.679
<i>Hello,
Eileen. Did you get my gift?</i>

00:27.679 --> 00:29.855
<i>The next bullet you receive
won't be in a box.</i>

00:32.858 --> 00:35.078
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Dennis.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.601
How's the blog?

00:36.601 --> 00:39.213
Governor, great to see so many
resources being employed

00:39.213 --> 00:40.257
to find Henley Scott.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.867
Can't put a price on life.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.956
To that point, an Alaska Native
woman's currently missing,

00:43.956 --> 00:45.915
and the amount of money
spent to find her

00:45.915 --> 00:47.786
is less than your sushi lunch.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.093
If it isn't my favorite
pilot poet.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.442
<i>Any chance
you're free tonight?</i>

00:51.442 --> 00:52.922
I gotta rain check.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.272
My, uh, colleagues--
I promised them a drink.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.405
<i>- Good night, Eileen.</i>
- Night, Jamie.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.710
Eileen.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.723
<i>The truth is,
we're the ones being bullied</i>

01:11.723 --> 01:13.290
<i>by the media.</i>

01:13.290 --> 01:15.292
<i>That is what's happening
in our public discourse.</i>

01:15.292 --> 01:17.425
<i>Disagree with anything
they say,</i>

01:17.425 --> 01:20.341
<i>and you're labeled fascist,
racist, homophobic.</i>

01:20.341 --> 01:22.082
<i>- That's bullying.</i>
- Last one inside.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.779
- Hey, guys,
wait up for me!
<i>- They're using language</i>

01:23.779 --> 01:25.650
<i>- like a cudgel...</i>
- Hurry up, Yuna!

01:25.650 --> 01:26.390
<i>...to get us to submit
to their moral subjectivism.</i>

01:26.390 --> 01:28.262
<i>Trust me, I know.</i>

01:28.262 --> 01:29.828
<i>I used to work
at the snowflake factory--</i>

01:57.421 --> 01:58.944
Good night, Jamie.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.774
Eileen.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.167
Who are you?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.603
You know who I am.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.258
Concerned Citizen.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.700
Don't do this.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.747
You left me no choice.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.057
Please, God,

02:25.057 --> 02:27.364
don't-- don't do this.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.149
Give me your phone.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.242
Get up.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.725
Get up!

02:44.033 --> 02:46.818
There are other people here.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.385
There's no one here, Eileen.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.430
It's just you and me.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.346
Move.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.742
Sit down.

02:57.742 --> 03:01.050
You know, we have a night editor
who comes in.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.921
No one
is getting inside this building.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.315
If they do, you're dead.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.670
I'm late.
That's my friends.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.150
They probably are wondering
where I am.

03:17.675 --> 03:18.589
Unlock it.

03:19.677 --> 03:20.722
Slowly.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.344
Whatcha need, Stanley?

03:34.344 --> 03:36.433
So many things.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.088
But I'll settle for
another round for the team.

03:39.088 --> 03:42.396
And a club soda for you?
You got it.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.964
I get that you don't
like the way I do my job.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.444
I'm an outsider.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.231
I'd like to apologize,
Mr.--

03:51.231 --> 03:52.449
Mm. No names.

03:52.449 --> 03:55.974
Okay. Concerned Citizen.

03:55.974 --> 03:58.977
What can I do
to make things right?

03:58.977 --> 04:02.024
I told you to go back
to New York.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.852
You're still here.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.333
I needed the job.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.204
No one would hire me.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.337
Why are you here?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.252
Because
you didn't listen to me.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.383
No one does.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.088
Ah!

04:23.088 --> 04:25.830
And she hits the Redeemer.
Triple 20.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.745
How are you so good at this?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.399
I practically lived here
before I had kids.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.183
Now, that Claire sounds fun.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.359
That Claire was.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.099
Ah! Dagnabbit!

04:34.099 --> 04:36.101
Language, Bob.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.886
You all right, Stanley?

04:37.886 --> 04:40.018
There's a gunman
in the newsroom.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.020
He's taken Eileen hostage.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.849
- What?
- He thinks
it's Concerned Citizen,

04:44.849 --> 04:46.155
the guy who's been
harassing her.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.330
Who's he?
Who are you talking to?

04:47.330 --> 04:49.680
Gabriel's hiding
in the Morgue.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.856
- Oh, my God.
- Concerned Citizen?

04:51.856 --> 04:54.381
The one who sent the bullet
to Eileen last month?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.208
We should have contacted
the police.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.210
- We should call them now.
- Won't that set him off?

04:58.210 --> 04:59.603
I mean, it could.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.952
We don't know
what this guy's capable of.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.215
We don't have a choice.
Call them.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.261
Agreed.
I'll make the call.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.131
Bob, call Pritchard.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.133
Will do.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.268
What's this for?

05:12.268 --> 05:13.965
Your confession.

05:13.965 --> 05:17.317
What am I confessing about?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.276
How you spread lies
and suppress the truth.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.713
How you faithfully serve
your corporate masters

05:22.713 --> 05:24.367
while they destroy
the backbone of our country.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.158
You read <i>The Eagle?</i>

05:33.158 --> 05:34.377
I do.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.423
Dennis Gibson,
he speaks the truth.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.122
He understands what's really
happening out there.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.864
He has an opinion
about what's happening,

05:42.864 --> 05:45.867
but from what I've read,
he doesn't deal in facts.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.738
Ah. You're one to talk.

05:47.738 --> 05:48.957
You're only in Anchorage
'cause you couldn't get

05:48.957 --> 05:51.916
your facts right
back in New York.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.875
And now you're out here
spreading the same liberal crap.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.356
I'm not political.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.097
I don't even vote.

05:59.097 --> 06:03.232
My... obligation is
to maintain objectivity--

06:03.232 --> 06:04.712
Your obligation?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.931
You abandoned your obligations
a long time ago, lady.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.587
See, I've done the reading.

06:10.587 --> 06:11.893
The purpose
of the fourth estate

06:11.893 --> 06:14.939
is to advocate
for the common man,

06:14.939 --> 06:16.811
and that sure as hell
does not describe you.

06:18.290 --> 06:21.598
Okay.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.253
So you want me to confess
about how I'm not doing my job.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.428
Is that it?

06:25.428 --> 06:26.255
Yeah, that's it.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.259
Write.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.311
Karla, could you
put a pot of coffee on?

06:39.311 --> 06:41.313
Yeah, sure can. It got
real quiet back there, though.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.619
Is everything all right?

06:42.619 --> 06:45.056
Uh, no. A situation
in the newsroom.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.318
Someone broke in,
appears to be armed.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.320
Are you serious?
Should we get out of here?

06:48.320 --> 06:51.106
Uh, not sure.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.977
Stanley's still on the phone
with the police,

06:52.977 --> 06:55.763
but you might want
to make this last call.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.156
Uh, oh, and maybe tell them
to use the back door.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.770
That was Captain Freeman.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.163
Freeman's on this?
Not exactly an ally.

07:05.163 --> 07:09.951
Maybe not, but he assured me
that he understands the threat

07:09.951 --> 07:12.910
and he's confident
that he can seal off the TDA

07:12.910 --> 07:14.303
without alerting the gunman.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.783
- Can we stay here?
- I am.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.132
Yeah, I'll talk to Karla.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.613
I know we're all concerned
and scared,

07:19.613 --> 07:22.964
but we need to put
all that aside and focus.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.227
The best way to help
Eileen and Gabriel

07:25.227 --> 07:27.664
is to get the police
some answers.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.493
Who is this guy and why the hell
did he come after Eileen?

07:33.061 --> 07:35.063
Okay, the place is all yours.
Back door's locked.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.065
Front door is open to the police
like you asked, okay?

07:37.065 --> 07:38.849
Thank you, Karla.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.198
All right,
I got our phone records,

07:40.198 --> 07:41.199
but until we get
the Concerned Citizen's name,

07:41.199 --> 07:42.505
there's nothing to cross check.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.593
There's a guy
who's been posting

07:43.593 --> 07:45.726
in our comments section recently.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.162
Oilman223.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.598
Listen to this.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.644
"Environmentalism is
the greatest thing to happen

07:50.644 --> 07:52.863
to increased government control
since 9/11."

07:52.863 --> 07:54.822
- That sounds like Dennis.
- It does.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.040
I'm on <i>The Eagle</i> blog
right now.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.042
Oilman223 basically did
a cut and paste.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.566
He's definitely a follower.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.871
Hey, I got the same handle
trolling Eileen's Twitter--

08:00.871 --> 08:02.960
@Oilman223.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.485
"@EileenFitzgerald's
shameful ambush of our governor

08:05.485 --> 08:06.877
will be her last."

08:06.877 --> 08:08.836
Did you check the profile
biography for a name?

08:08.836 --> 08:11.795
Yeah, it's blank. He's disabled
location services, too.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.231
This jerk was getting ready
for this.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.059
Let's crowdsource it.
Publish his handle.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.626
Someone has to know
his real identity.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.976
- We'd risk exposing the story.
- Yeah, about that.

08:18.976 --> 08:21.065
I hate to bring it up,
but are we reporting

08:21.065 --> 08:23.633
- this hostage situation or not?
- Fair question.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.200
Any other hostage crisis,
we'd be all over it.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.681
But if we go public,
there's no telling

08:27.681 --> 08:30.074
how Oilman223 will react.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.728
The police are on their way.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.818
It's only gonna be unnoticed
for so long.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.820
TV crews get wind of it,
it's gonna blow up.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.953
Who cares?
It's not about that.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.259
We'll deal with that
when it comes.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.913
Sure, we'll get scooped,

08:42.913 --> 08:45.873
but I want to give the cops
as much time as possible.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.658
Remember, we'll be the only ones
on the inside of this thing,

08:48.658 --> 08:50.921
so the second it breaks,
we should be posting

08:50.921 --> 08:53.750
a minute-by-minute account
on TDA's feed.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.753
Until then, no reporting.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.153
You done?

09:06.981 --> 09:08.156
Not yet.

09:08.156 --> 09:11.507
I understand
what you want me to write,

09:11.507 --> 09:15.467
but...
it's not what I believe.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.513
Yeah. That's the problem.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.385
You write whatever you want.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.910
You don't care who goes down
because of it.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.912
Can you give me an example?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.609
Your last article
on General Greene

09:26.609 --> 09:29.699
grounded an entire fleet
of F41s.

09:29.699 --> 09:33.007
The production line
at Armeon was shut down.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.487
A lot of people are gonna
lose their jobs.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.794
Tell that to the parents
of the dead pilot.

09:37.794 --> 09:38.752
That's not the point.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.712
It is the point.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.714
Printing the truth
has hard consequences,

09:44.714 --> 09:47.891
and we all struggle with that,
but you can't blame me for--

09:47.891 --> 09:49.676
Don't give me that "Don't shoot
the messenger" crap.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.984
Then don't shoot
the messenger.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.290
Finish the confession.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.511
And then what?

10:06.606 --> 10:10.000
Oh, come on.
Pick up, pick up.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.001
Talk to me.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.568
You okay?

10:12.568 --> 10:14.614
<i>For now.</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:16.093
And Eileen?

10:16.093 --> 10:17.747
It's pretty tense in there.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.619
He's forcing her
to write a confession.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.838
Is she going along with it?

10:21.838 --> 10:23.666
<i>She is, but not quietly.</i>

10:23.666 --> 10:27.278
I want to help,
but I don't know how.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.108
Stay calm.
We're talking to the police.

10:31.108 --> 10:34.111
<i>Is there a way you can
get a message to Eileen?</i>

10:34.111 --> 10:37.027
Without being seen?
I-I-I don't know.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.029
He took away her phone. Uh...

10:46.863 --> 10:47.951
Wait.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.089
She can see the Analytics Page.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.128
Okay, we have a way
to get information to Eileen.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.260
Where are we with Oilman223?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.523
He's created dozens of sock
puppet accounts on Twitter.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.612
- Fakes?
- People use it
to amplify their messaging,

11:40.612 --> 11:42.745
and he's having them like
and retweet his comments.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.878
- What a loser.
- None of the accounts
are verified,

11:44.878 --> 11:47.097
but I found a link
that's connected to a website.

11:47.097 --> 11:50.187
The domain name is registered
by an E.L. Barry.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.712
I'm logged into Nexis.
There's an Eric Lowell Barry.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.844
Address on Spenard.
Not sure if it's current.

11:54.844 --> 11:58.152
Um, a few unpaid
parking tickets and a DUI.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.631
But no history
of violent crime?

11:59.631 --> 12:00.763
Anybody get a photo
on this guy?

12:00.763 --> 12:01.590
Here.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.552
- What are you doing?
- Gabriel can see him.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.601
Stanley.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.472
Aaron, back here.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.997
Got him.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.738
I'll let Anchorage PD know
we have a name.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.652
- Okay.
- We have a name?

12:20.652 --> 12:24.091
We do.
Eric Lowell Barry.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.657
What do we know about him?

12:25.657 --> 12:28.051
He's disgruntled,
to say the least.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.792
How's Eileen doing?

12:29.792 --> 12:31.359
Gabriel says
she seems all right.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.797
We have a way to get her
messages on the Analytics Page.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.929
Let's go talk
to Captain Freeman. He's here.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.278
Okay.

12:44.676 --> 12:45.939
Bravo Team
to Ground Element.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.942
I have eyes on the suspect.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.204
<i>Copy, Bravo Team.</i>

12:50.204 --> 12:51.683
<i>Sit tight.</i>

12:56.166 --> 12:58.255
Mr. Cornik, Mr. Pritchard.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.735
Captain. How can we help?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.084
You've been
very helpful so far.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.782
This is Laura Cole,
senior member

13:02.782 --> 13:04.522
of our
Crisis Negotiation Team.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.698
I understand we have a name,
Eric Barry,

13:06.698 --> 13:08.048
and can communicate
with Eileen.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.484
- Anything else?
- Not yet.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.051
We're still compiling info
on Eric.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.836
I need Cole to establish contact
as soon as possible.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.490
What's the best office line
for us to call?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.492
Is that safe? Calling?

13:17.492 --> 13:18.536
The best way to protect
your colleagues

13:18.536 --> 13:20.190
is to get this guy talking.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.671
But any other info your team
uncovers would be very helpful.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.020
Okay, so let's keep
sharing information.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.892
In the meantime,
I'm gonna have our snipers

13:25.892 --> 13:28.068
monitoring the newsroom.

13:28.068 --> 13:32.986
"I confess that I,
Eileen Fitzgerald,

13:32.986 --> 13:35.858
am a member
of the liberal media elite.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.251
Not only is
my reporting biased,

13:37.251 --> 13:40.123
it represents a concerted effort
to suppress the truth

13:40.123 --> 13:43.126
and spread lies,
lies which only serve

13:43.126 --> 13:45.999
the global interests
of multi-national corporations

13:45.999 --> 13:48.740
whose ultimate aim is
to control our government

13:48.740 --> 13:50.612
and restrict
our constitutional freedoms..."

13:54.224 --> 13:55.225
That work?

13:56.966 --> 13:58.620
Yeah.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.751
Now type it up and publish it.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.886
- I can't do that.
- The hell you can't.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.019
No, I-I literally mean
I can't.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.542
I don't know how to publish.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.544
My editor has to send me
a live link.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.024
Then get him
to send you a link.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.765
It won't work.
He has to read it, proof it.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.724
Uh, I mean,
editors are like dogs.

14:15.724 --> 14:16.768
They have to piss on everything.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.901
This isn't some damn joke.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.556
I'm not joking.
This confession isn't me.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.992
He'll see right through it.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.167
Anyone who reads it
will see right through it.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.564
That might be my editor.
Let me talk to him--

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
Report.
What happened?

14:34.047 --> 14:37.137
Report.

14:41.228 --> 14:44.100
What happened?
Did the suspect fire?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.449
<i>Confirmed.
A shot was fired.</i>

14:45.449 --> 14:47.408
<i>Stand by for confirmation.</i>

14:47.408 --> 14:50.280
<i>Shot was wide.
Hostage is unharmed.</i>

14:56.112 --> 14:58.636
I wasn't gonna answer it.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.377
I'm just making sure.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.947
I have to go to the bathroom.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.644
This better not be
some kind of trick.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.081
It isn't.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.560
I've been here for hours. Please.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.738
What was that?
Everything okay?

15:13.738 --> 15:17.438
He fired his weapon,
but Eileen's okay.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.962
Claire, you should go home,
deal with your family.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.398
Jeff's got it handled.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.139
I'm not leaving, not while
they're still in there.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.272
- None of us are.
- Thanks, Karla.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.534
Okay, where are we?

15:26.534 --> 15:29.102
Still compiling Eric's posts
and comments.

15:29.102 --> 15:32.279
Any idea why he targeted Eileen?

15:32.279 --> 15:34.107
He definitely hates
mainstream media,

15:34.107 --> 15:35.369
but when it comes
to his trolling,

15:35.369 --> 15:36.761
he doesn't call out
any specific offense.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.546
Yeah, he parrots
Dennis Gibson mostly.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.156
A majority of his work
is on <i>The Eagle.</i>

15:40.156 --> 15:41.157
They were trading messages
right before

15:41.157 --> 15:43.464
Eric walked into the newsroom.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.162
Dennis compared Eileen
to a "spreading cancerous sore

15:46.162 --> 15:48.991
- that requires excising."
- What a dick.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.558
He was my first editor
at the paper.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.776
I'm gonna wake his ass up.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.213
- Cool?
- Yeah. Go.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.609
Hey, guys.
This is Detective Kowalczyk.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.611
- Hello.
- Hey, Walz.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.004
Austin, good to see you.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.266
Sorry it's under
these circumstances.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.312
Us, too, Detective.
How can we help?

16:05.312 --> 16:08.968
Yeah, I have a last known
address for Eric Barry.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.013
- Northwood Drive?
- Exactly.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.972
He's been fighting eviction
for months.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.625
Guess when the bank finally
foreclosed on him?

16:14.625 --> 16:16.105
Three days ago.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.499
Stanley, maybe I head
over there, too?

16:18.499 --> 16:19.413
Canvass the neighbors,
see what they know?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.805
Yeah. Go.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.112
Well, if your car's out front,
it's, uh, trapped

16:23.112 --> 16:25.593
by the police line.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.377
Uh, can you give me a lift?

16:27.377 --> 16:30.424
Uh, officially, no, but if we
call it a "ride-along,"

16:30.424 --> 16:32.600
I can do,
but you have to ask me first.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.473
Can I do a ride-along with you,
Walz?

16:36.473 --> 16:39.520
If you sign a waiver, yes.
Let's go.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.104
You going?

16:59.148 --> 17:01.498
I can't.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.152
I've never peed at gunpoint.

17:07.591 --> 17:11.073
You worked on oil rigs?
Your boots.

17:11.073 --> 17:15.034
I covered the Deepwater Horizon
in 2010.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.080
Yeah, you covered it, huh?

17:18.080 --> 17:20.039
You ever do any real work,
or just cover it?

17:21.301 --> 17:24.434
I think what I do is real.

17:24.434 --> 17:27.611
But if you mean skilled labor,
not so much.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.265
My father did.

17:29.265 --> 17:34.314
He was a... steel worker
in Youngstown, Ohio.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.750
Just like his father.

17:37.752 --> 17:38.927
He was proud of that.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.410
I was, too.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.021
That supposed to make me
like you or something?

17:46.021 --> 17:49.546
You keep calling me elite.

17:49.546 --> 17:54.029
I didn't grow up with money
or fancy schools.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.597
My mom was a teacher.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.643
We didn't have a lot,
but it was a good life.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.603
Then that all went sideways in
the '80s when the mills closed.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.694
My dad was never the same.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.958
It broke him.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.438
It broke our whole family.

18:17.226 --> 18:20.316
We both know
how this goes down.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.536
You're about to be
national news.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.452
Use it. Use me.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.497
Let me tell your story.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.630
So you can twist it into
some angry-white-male crap

18:29.630 --> 18:31.284
for your woke mob?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.024
I was canceled by that mob.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.418
Screw them. I'll be fair.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.159
And anyway,
you'll be able to read it

18:37.159 --> 18:39.292
before I send it
to my editor to publish.

18:41.381 --> 18:44.166
My words?

18:44.166 --> 18:46.690
Gabriel says Eileen
has Eric talking now,

18:46.690 --> 18:48.388
seems less agitated.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.259
That can change
in a split second.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.174
And no luck reaching him
on the phone?

18:52.174 --> 18:54.176
We tried a couple
of the other landlines.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.612
He didn't shoot them,
but he's not picking up.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.484
So, what's the plan?

18:57.484 --> 18:59.355
I have three
sniper teams in position.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.358
Only one has a high
probability of a kill shot.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.621
I want to give him the green
light, but there's one problem.

19:04.621 --> 19:07.668
- What's that?
- Your reporter's in the way.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.366
You want us to tell her to move
so you can shoot the guy?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.846
Might be the quickest,
safest way to end this thing.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.631
I say do it.

19:18.026 --> 19:22.378
I worked on rigs all my life,
onshore and off.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.727
Started on the North Slope

19:23.727 --> 19:25.512
straight out of high school
as a worm.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.470
Worked my way up.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.256
Shell came to town in, uh, 2012

19:30.256 --> 19:33.259
with a $6 billion spend.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.087
Those were great years.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.394
Coulda kept it going,
but then ANWR

19:38.394 --> 19:40.222
and all that crap
messed it up.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.093
Who's ANWR?

19:42.093 --> 19:44.052
Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.228
See, the Feds, they control
this huge amount of land,

19:46.228 --> 19:48.361
but they're controlled
by Greenpeace

19:48.361 --> 19:51.320
and all these other
environmental freaks.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.669
Protested non-stop.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.497
They delayed our ice-breakers.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.586
They sabotaged the Kulluk.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.066
- The drilling rig?
- Yeah.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.242
Well, I thought that thing
had problems for years--

20:00.242 --> 20:02.244
multiple engine failures,
that kinda thing.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.768
Yeah, if you believe
the mainstream press.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.597
So, Shell pulled out?

20:07.597 --> 20:11.122
In 2015, then Chevron,
then Imperial.

20:11.122 --> 20:14.561
Governmental regulations
and this mass hysteria

20:14.561 --> 20:18.434
over this global warming BS
has killed Alaska oil.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.437
You really think
global warming is BS?

20:21.437 --> 20:23.265
Well, I think
it's a zero sum game.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.746
Either we burn fossil fuels,

20:25.746 --> 20:28.052
or-- or we mine
for "green" batteries.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.098
It's all the same result.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.535
So why not just let us work?

20:32.535 --> 20:36.365
Meanwhile, I-I haven't worked
for seven years.

20:36.365 --> 20:37.497
Seven.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.066
And, yeah, it breaks you.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.730
What are you looking at?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.515
Just wondering if
it's light outside yet.

21:08.484 --> 21:11.400
Damn it. She said no.
She's not moving.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.316
God.
Why is she protecting this guy?

21:14.316 --> 21:16.187
Why does Eileen do anything?

21:16.187 --> 21:17.493
If she's talking to Barry,

21:17.493 --> 21:19.495
he may have become
more human to her.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.324
She knows if she plays
along with us, he's dead.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.413
She doesn't want to be
responsible for his death.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.197
Let's hope he feels
the same way.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.460
I wouldn't count on it.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.376
In my experience,
as the pressure mounts,

21:30.376 --> 21:32.247
there's a good chance
he could act on his plan.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.509
Which is to kill Eileen.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.816
Based on what we know, yes.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.963
- Oh. Did I wake you?
- The hell are you doing here?

21:52.963 --> 21:54.922
One of your devoted followers
has taken

21:54.922 --> 21:58.273
Eileen Fitzgerald hostage
in the newsroom at gunpoint.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.927
Suggesting it's my fault?

21:59.927 --> 22:02.103
I'm suggesting you need to talk
some sense into him.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.371
So, now I'm the nut whisperer.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.374
Nuts you embolden.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.984
Eric Barry.

22:13.984 --> 22:18.337
You probably know him better
as Oilman223.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.251
I've had a few exchanges
with him.

22:20.251 --> 22:23.167
I don't recall telling him
to take a reporter hostage.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.300
Last night,
an hour before he did,

22:25.300 --> 22:28.782
you two corresponded
on the <i>Eagle</i> message board.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.131
He asked you what a man's
supposed to do

22:30.131 --> 22:32.220
while people like
Eileen Fitzgerald

22:32.220 --> 22:34.440
"twist facts to turn
the great state of Alaska

22:34.440 --> 22:37.007
into another woke mess
like California."

22:37.007 --> 22:38.444
- It's a good question.
- Mm-hmm.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.097
And what did you say?

22:40.097 --> 22:43.057
I say a lot of things
to my devoted readers. I--

22:43.057 --> 22:45.799
"Take action, Oilman223.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.149
Reporters like Eileen Fitzgerald

22:48.149 --> 22:51.457
are a spreading cancerous sore
that requires excising."

22:51.457 --> 22:53.241
It goes without saying,
I'm speaking metaphorically.

22:53.241 --> 22:56.723
When I talk about taking action,
I mean political action.

22:56.723 --> 22:59.465
I don't think Eric got
the nuance of that.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.989
- You need to call him.
- I'm not getting involved.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.817
You are involved.

23:03.817 --> 23:04.861
Do you want him to kill her?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.776
You can't put this on me, Roz.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.039
I didn't make him sad and angry
and frustrated.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.432
All I did was let him know
he was right

23:10.432 --> 23:13.261
to feel those things,
which he deserved to hear.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.871
I can write this story
one of two ways.

23:14.871 --> 23:18.222
Either you're a villain who
instigated a hostage situation

23:18.222 --> 23:21.269
or a hero who helped save
a fellow journalist.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.923
What's it gonna be?

24:01.744 --> 24:03.442
- Good morning. Mr. Torgeson?
- Yeah.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.095
Austin Teague, <i>Daily Alaskan.</i>

24:05.095 --> 24:06.270
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about your neighbor,

24:06.270 --> 24:07.315
Eric Barry.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.882
Why? Something happen?

24:08.882 --> 24:10.449
Well, I can't give
any specifics,

24:10.449 --> 24:12.015
but he got himself into
some trouble with the police.

24:12.015 --> 24:13.756
I'm just trying to get
some background on him.

24:13.756 --> 24:14.888
Guess I'm not surprised.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.280
Yeah? Why's that?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.369
We used to have a beer
every once in a while.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.415
He took some hits in his life
and got real angry.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.808
And paranoid.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.374
- Paranoid?
- Yeah.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.941
Fenced in his yard.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.508
Even started booby-trapping
the property.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.423
He almost killed my dog.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.860
Walz! Walz, hold up!

24:37.476 --> 24:38.520
Walz?

24:51.751 --> 24:53.143
Walz?

24:53.143 --> 24:55.232
Cool. Okay.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.933
Look. It's nice, huh?

25:14.338 --> 25:16.123
I get that
it's been hard, but oil jobs

25:16.123 --> 25:18.255
are coming back, right?

25:18.255 --> 25:19.822
Not for people like me.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.825
Which means that even if things
are equal résumé wise,

25:22.825 --> 25:25.524
and mostly they're not,
I'm not getting hired.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.310
You think that's fair?
Hmm?

25:29.310 --> 25:31.442
Or even legal?

25:31.442 --> 25:33.401
Maybe not the way
you describe it.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.533
You sound like my ex-wife.

25:35.838 --> 25:36.622
What happened?

25:38.406 --> 25:40.713
She met someone
with a sunnier outlook.

25:40.713 --> 25:43.106
I'm sorry.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.368
Kids?

25:44.368 --> 25:45.413
Daughter.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.675
Where is she now?

25:48.851 --> 25:49.678
I don't want to talk about her.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.334
You leave her out of this.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.465
You hear me?

25:55.554 --> 25:57.207
I hear you.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.256
I clear first,
then you come in.

26:02.256 --> 26:05.085
Yeah.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.229
We're good.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.934
Guess he didn't pay
his electric bill, either.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.466
Hey, Walz.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.033
Yeah?

26:49.825 --> 26:52.175
Daughter.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.177
You know, let me see
if I can find her socials.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.663
Daisy Barry.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.533
All right, got her.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.928
She's pretty active
on Instagram.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.367
Her last post was from rehab.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.804
Hmm.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.240
You should read.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.383
This is a goodbye letter.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.038
Mr. Barry doesn't expect
to come out of this alive.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.869
People have started posting
about the police presence.

27:33.869 --> 27:34.827
We knew this would happen.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.047
That was Austin.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.919
Eric has a daughter,
college age.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.398
He left her
a goodbye letter.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.792
- Where is she?
- In a treatment center
in Wasilla.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.707
We should reach out.
She might be able to help.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.448
We should. Find her. Now.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.407
I can drive. No, I can't.
My car's in the lot.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.888
Here. Take my Range Rover.
It's in the back alley.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.281
Range Rover?

27:54.281 --> 27:57.023
Never drove a car
that cost more than my house.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.373
Do you know who first
sounded the alarm

27:59.373 --> 28:00.809
on the greenhouse effect?

28:00.809 --> 28:02.942
I don't know.
Some Harvard jackass?

28:03.943 --> 28:04.726
No.

28:06.162 --> 28:08.077
It was Exxon.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.689
1977. They funded a study.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.779
Their own scientists discovered
that CO2 from carbon emissions

28:13.779 --> 28:15.998
was catastrophic to the Earth.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.739
They recommended that
Exxon lead the charge

28:17.739 --> 28:19.349
in alternative fuel sources.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.090
But they didn't.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.005
No. They buried it.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.747
It didn't resurface
until reporters dug it up.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.271
Finding the truth is like...

28:28.271 --> 28:30.273
climbing out of a well.

28:30.273 --> 28:33.929
You have to pile fact
on top of fact.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.149
When you're struggling
just to keep the lights on

28:36.149 --> 28:38.064
or put food on the table,

28:38.064 --> 28:40.370
facts don't matter much.

28:40.370 --> 28:44.331
Facts matter because the anger
is fueled by misinformation,

28:44.331 --> 28:48.465
and that comes from
so-called "trusted sources,"

28:48.465 --> 28:50.511
like your friend Dennis.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.296
Yeah, well, Dennis describes
the world I actually live in.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.037
He does.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.257
He understands that people
are struggling.

28:57.257 --> 29:00.826
They feel abandoned,
pushed to the back of the line.

29:00.826 --> 29:06.135
But he also exploits that pain
until anger metastasizes

29:06.135 --> 29:09.182
into an idea--
someone needs to pay.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.186
And then you pick up a gun.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.928
Not him. You.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.850
Hello?

29:24.850 --> 29:26.721
<i>Good morning, Mr. Barry.</i>

29:26.721 --> 29:28.244
My name is Laura Cole.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.986
I'm with the APD's
Crisis Negotiation Team.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.901
We have units
outside the building,

29:32.901 --> 29:36.035
but I want to assure you
nobody is coming in.

29:36.035 --> 29:39.429
<i>- I just want to talk.</i>
- Okay. Talk.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.911
<i>First, can you tell me
how Eileen Fitzgerald is?</i>

29:42.911 --> 29:45.784
She's fine.
For the moment.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.097
"Deranged Anchorage Man Takes
Journalist Hostage at TDA."

29:57.230 --> 29:59.058
So now I'm deranged, huh?

30:02.757 --> 30:05.281
Why do you keep looking
at that?

30:05.281 --> 30:06.456
Just waiting for you
to finish reading.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.371
Stop talking.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.291
All right. Where are
these messages coming from?

30:18.251 --> 30:19.426
Are these coming from inside?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.342
They could be coming
from anyone with a computer.

30:22.342 --> 30:23.952
Stop lying to me!

30:25.824 --> 30:28.348
Tell me where these messages
are coming from.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.223
Come here.

30:41.317 --> 30:42.884
<i>He knows.
He's coming for me.</i>

30:45.191 --> 30:48.150
Gabriel, he's going to find you.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.413
Try to stay calm
and do what he says.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.285
We're doing everything we can.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.939
Get Roz on the phone.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.028
Tell her we need Dennis
to call Eric now.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.161
Get over here.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.120
<i>- Come here! Get over here!
- Hey, it's okay.</i>

31:01.120 --> 31:03.122
<i>- Shut up. Come on.
- Stop!</i>

31:03.122 --> 31:04.036
<i>- Come with me.
- Please,
please, please.</i>

31:12.827 --> 31:14.742
"Confirm at 9:17 p.m.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.091

by a disgruntled oil worker."

31:18.093 --> 31:20.139
- Okay, next tweet.
- Go.

31:20.139 --> 31:23.620
"#Breaking-- Moments ago,
a second reporter who was hiding

Anchorage PD is on the scene.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.408

Shut up!

- What?
- That's right.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.480
Quite a circus down
at <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

31:57.480 --> 31:58.960
Just curious what your--
what your take is.

32:00.527 --> 32:01.528
How'd you get my number?

32:04.531 --> 32:06.446
You listed it
when you subscribed.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.624
Yeah, well...

32:10.624 --> 32:11.625
I haven't really
been following the news.

32:13.061 --> 32:16.847
Yeah, it's all over Twitter.
Just... what's going on?

32:16.847 --> 32:18.849
<i>I'm just-- I'm just doing
my part. That's all, Dennis.</i>

32:18.849 --> 32:20.112

32:23.680 --> 32:24.507

E-Eric, listen, man,

32:28.859 --> 32:31.775
I use language sometimes
to fire people up.

- You never meant what?

32:34.082 --> 32:34.953
A word of it?

32:38.434 --> 32:39.870
<i>They got to you,
didn't they?</i>

32:39.870 --> 32:41.481
What? No.
No one got to me.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.004
They got to you.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.398
<i>No one-- Eric.</i>

32:47.922 --> 32:49.141
He's gone.

32:49.141 --> 32:52.013
Wait, Roz, you saw me.
Hey, I tried.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.493
You--
You can't put this on me.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.755
I'm not the criminal here.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.191
You sure about that?

32:57.888 --> 32:59.499
<i>You think
that was clever, huh?</i>

32:59.499 --> 33:00.717
<i>Having Gibson call me?</i>

33:00.717 --> 33:03.329
Mr. Barry,
I don't know any Gibson.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.505
<i>If someone else called you,
that didn't go through us.</i>

33:05.505 --> 33:07.463
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah,
you wanna play me?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.596
Go ahead.
See what happens.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.946
<i>That is not our intention,
Mr. Barry.</i>

33:11.946 --> 33:13.643
I promised you we would keep
our distance.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.950
We have and will continue to,

33:15.950 --> 33:17.952
<i>but I need you to negotiate
with me in good faith.</i>

33:17.952 --> 33:20.041
Then stop playing games.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.739
<i>No games.
I promise.</i>

33:22.739 --> 33:25.960
We know you are holding
two people inside now.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.179
<i>Is anyone hurt?</i>

33:30.791 --> 33:32.749
No. No one's hurt.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.577
Good.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.450
Now, why don't we start
with what you want.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.886
<i>What I want, huh?</i>

33:38.886 --> 33:41.280
Your demands.
Can you share that with me?

33:43.151 --> 33:45.545
Offer to let Gabriel go.

33:45.545 --> 33:46.720
I can't leave you
with him.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.026
<i>Mr. Barry?</i>

33:48.026 --> 33:49.549
Yeah, I'm s--
I'm still here.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.680
Trust me, Eric.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.943
It will buy you some time
and good will.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.078
I'll call you back.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.955
This type of traumatic news
could cause a relapse,

34:04.955 --> 34:07.045
- so I'm concerned that--
- You're concerned?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.525
Some nutjob is holding a gun
on two of our colleagues.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.700
You heard that part, right?

34:10.700 --> 34:14.095
We'll be as tactful
as we can.

34:14.095 --> 34:17.968
Daisy, these are reporters
from <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

34:17.968 --> 34:19.970
They want to talk to you
about your father.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.019
That's my dad in there?

34:26.760 --> 34:27.891
I'm sorry
to spring this on you,

34:27.891 --> 34:29.632
but our friends
are in real danger.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.330
Well, what can I do?

34:31.330 --> 34:33.636
We'd like for you to come back
to the newsroom with us.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.943
If you could just talk
to your dad--

34:35.943 --> 34:37.684
There's nothing
that I can say.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.077
I haven't seen or spoken
to him in years.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.556
Just seeing you there
could help.

34:42.689 --> 34:44.778
He threw me out.
He can't stand me.

34:44.778 --> 34:45.909
That's not true.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.695
He left you a letter
full of regret.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.436
And you can read it,
but what you need to know

34:50.436 --> 34:51.785
is that
he was saying goodbye.

34:51.785 --> 34:54.353
He's not planning on
coming out alive.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.745
You could change that.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.969
Look, my dad,
he doesn't want to change.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.144
He's not well.

35:05.407 --> 35:07.888
I'm the last person
that could reach him.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.107
I can't help you.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.372
- Daisy, please--
- I just can't.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.025
I'm sorry.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.637
Daisy. Wait!

35:20.509 --> 35:21.423
What's on your mind?

35:23.686 --> 35:24.644
I'm not sure.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.257
I'm just tired of feeling
like this.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.175
Of feeling less than.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.483
And being angry...

35:40.007 --> 35:41.008
...at everyone.

35:46.448 --> 35:49.321
Eric, it feels like
we're coming to the end here.

35:51.758 --> 35:55.805
No one's been hurt, which means
you can walk out that door

35:55.805 --> 35:57.720
and not give away
your entire future.

36:00.897 --> 36:01.898
What future?

36:09.515 --> 36:10.603
Can I see that?

36:12.387 --> 36:13.388
What you've been writing?

36:39.893 --> 36:41.547
You don't make me sound
like a monster...

36:43.505 --> 36:44.680
...or an idiot.

36:47.727 --> 36:48.684
You're gonna get this printed?

36:50.817 --> 36:52.732
You have my word.

36:52.732 --> 36:55.735
Well, that's something,
I guess.

36:57.737 --> 36:58.738
That's something.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.057
Eric, where are you going?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.410
Eric, don't.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.677
Eric.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.351
Eileen.

38:10.679 --> 38:11.898
Come to me!
Come to me!

38:18.078 --> 38:19.645
- You're both good to go.
- Thanks.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.605
Never seen anyone die before.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.260
Have you?

38:27.479 --> 38:29.350
I have, yeah.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.265
In Afghanistan.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.018
Eileen.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.065
Are you hurt?

38:49.065 --> 38:51.154
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.291
Oh, God.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.387
Hey, is, uh,
the bar still open?

39:06.387 --> 39:08.563
We've been here all night.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.349
All of us. Never left.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.002
Even Bob.

39:13.002 --> 39:15.135
He and Yuna went to track down
Barry's daughter.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.314
You're good people.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.404
Thanks.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.319
You're one of us.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.714
Come on.
I'll take you back to the hotel.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.688

39:54.914 --> 39:56.437

It's me.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.189
Yeah.

41:38.017 --> 41:39.497
Uh, I got a favor to ask.
