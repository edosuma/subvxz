00:34.507 --> 00:36.759
Lumos Maxima.

00:39.053 --> 00:41.805
Lumos Maxima.

01:01.909 --> 01:03.536
Lumos Maxima.

01:05.788 --> 01:07.706
Lumos Maxima.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.585
Lumos Maxima!

01:40.990 --> 01:42.575
Harry. Harry.

01:42.741 --> 01:44.743
Harry, open the door.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.961
Marge. How lovely to see...

01:54.170 --> 01:57.548
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

01:57.715 --> 01:59.049
What is it?

01:59.216 --> 02:01.343
Nothing. School stuff.

02:01.510 --> 02:04.180
Later perhaps, if you behave.

02:04.346 --> 02:06.557
I will if she does.

02:06.724 --> 02:09.852
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

02:10.269 --> 02:12.897
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

02:13.063 --> 02:15.024
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

02:15.191 --> 02:19.528
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

02:19.695 --> 02:24.074
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

02:24.241 --> 02:26.035
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

02:26.202 --> 02:28.496
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

02:28.662 --> 02:30.623
Okay.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.879
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.841
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

02:41.050 --> 02:44.011
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

02:44.595 --> 02:46.597
A bit more.

02:47.139 --> 02:50.434
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

02:50.643 --> 02:53.229
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

02:56.315 --> 02:58.317
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

02:58.484 --> 03:02.530
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

03:04.031 --> 03:05.825
What are you smirking at?

03:05.991 --> 03:07.827
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

03:08.035 --> 03:11.330
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

03:11.497 --> 03:14.500
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

03:17.962 --> 03:19.296
Oh, yeah.

03:19.505 --> 03:22.174
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

03:22.341 --> 03:24.927
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

03:25.135 --> 03:28.264
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

03:28.430 --> 03:31.559
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

03:31.725 --> 03:35.646
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

03:35.813 --> 03:37.982
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

03:38.149 --> 03:41.152
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

03:41.318 --> 03:44.155
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

03:44.321 --> 03:46.866
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

03:49.869 --> 03:53.956
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

03:54.123 --> 03:55.958
I think it's time you went to bed.

03:56.125 --> 03:59.378
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

04:00.754 --> 04:03.757
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

04:03.966 --> 04:07.720
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

04:07.887 --> 04:11.932
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

04:12.141 --> 04:13.809
Shut up! Shut up!

04:18.814 --> 04:20.565
Right.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.860
Let me tell you...

04:44.298 --> 04:46.425
Vernon!

04:49.470 --> 04:51.263
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

05:34.723 --> 05:36.725
Stop!

05:39.311 --> 05:41.856
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

05:45.317 --> 05:47.278
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

05:48.571 --> 05:50.364
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

05:51.574 --> 05:53.409
Oh, Vernon.

05:53.576 --> 05:55.327
Oh, God.

05:55.494 --> 05:57.288
Marge!

06:04.336 --> 06:06.547
Please!

06:07.173 --> 06:09.383
Marge!

06:10.467 --> 06:13.637
Come back!

06:37.620 --> 06:40.039
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

06:40.206 --> 06:43.459
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

06:43.918 --> 06:47.046
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

06:47.254 --> 06:50.257
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

06:50.424 --> 06:51.759
You've nowhere to go.

06:51.926 --> 06:54.261
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

08:30.399 --> 08:32.234
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

08:32.400 --> 08:35.779
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

08:35.946 --> 08:40.909
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

08:44.663 --> 08:46.081
What you doing down there?

08:46.832 --> 08:49.001
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

08:49.210 --> 08:51.879
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

08:52.087 --> 08:54.256
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

09:01.388 --> 09:04.433
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.352
Well, come on, then. In.

09:06.519 --> 09:09.355
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

09:14.318 --> 09:16.529
Come on.

09:26.413 --> 09:29.166
Come on. Move on, move on.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.184
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

09:47.351 --> 09:49.603
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

10:00.281 --> 10:03.576
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.247
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

10:08.455 --> 10:11.375
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

10:11.542 --> 10:13.878
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

10:14.044 --> 10:16.839
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

10:20.259 --> 10:22.887
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

10:23.053 --> 10:24.805
They don't see nothing, do they?

10:24.972 --> 10:27.516
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

10:29.268 --> 10:32.313
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

10:41.071 --> 10:43.616
Ten, nine, eight...

10:43.824 --> 10:46.535
...seven, six, five...

10:46.744 --> 10:48.996
...four, three, three and a half...

10:49.205 --> 10:50.998
...two, one and three quarters.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.167
Yes!

10:57.505 --> 10:58.881
Who is that?

10:59.089 --> 11:01.467
That man.

11:03.135 --> 11:04.929
Who is that?

11:05.137 --> 11:06.639
Who is...?

11:06.847 --> 11:09.225
That is Sirius Black, that is.

11:09.809 --> 11:13.062
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

11:14.355 --> 11:16.649
He's a murderer.

11:16.816 --> 11:19.443
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

11:20.110 --> 11:23.531
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

11:23.697 --> 11:25.658
He's the first one that done it.

11:26.617 --> 11:29.245
He was a big supporter of...

11:29.745 --> 11:31.247
...You-Know-Who.

11:31.956 --> 11:33.833
I reckon you've heard of him.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.584
Yeah.

11:35.751 --> 11:37.086
Him I've heard of.

11:39.755 --> 11:42.424
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

11:42.925 --> 11:44.593
They're getting closer, Ernie.

11:45.386 --> 11:47.638
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

11:55.020 --> 11:57.439
Mind your head.

12:02.319 --> 12:04.280
Hey, guys? Guys?

12:04.488 --> 12:06.657
Why the long faces?

12:12.496 --> 12:14.915
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

12:20.379 --> 12:23.757
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.761
Mr. Potter, at last.

12:30.764 --> 12:33.476
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

12:56.665 --> 12:58.501
Room 11.

13:01.086 --> 13:02.421
Hedwig.

13:02.588 --> 13:05.424
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

13:05.591 --> 13:09.303
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

13:11.222 --> 13:14.850
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

13:15.017 --> 13:18.229
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

13:18.395 --> 13:22.358
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

13:22.525 --> 13:26.278
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

13:26.445 --> 13:31.242
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

13:31.450 --> 13:36.121
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

13:36.288 --> 13:38.874
So that's that...

13:39.041 --> 13:41.919
...and no harm done.

13:42.586 --> 13:43.921
Pea soup?

13:44.088 --> 13:46.215
No, thank you.

13:46.382 --> 13:48.592
- Minister?
- Yes?

13:48.759 --> 13:50.511
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

13:50.719 --> 13:54.265
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

13:54.473 --> 13:57.476
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

13:57.643 --> 14:00.187
...for blowing up their aunts.

14:04.150 --> 14:08.696
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

14:08.863 --> 14:11.323
...was very, very irresponsible.

14:11.532 --> 14:15.327
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

14:15.494 --> 14:17.329
Sirius Black, you mean?

14:17.496 --> 14:19.248
But what's he got to do with me?

14:21.542 --> 14:26.380
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

14:26.589 --> 14:29.717
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

14:29.884 --> 14:32.845
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

14:33.012 --> 14:37.016
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

14:41.812 --> 14:43.147
Hedwig.

14:43.481 --> 14:48.402
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

14:48.694 --> 14:51.155
...wander.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.618
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

16:14.405 --> 16:16.448
Housekeeping.

16:19.869 --> 16:22.121
I'll come back later.

16:29.712 --> 16:31.130
I'm warning you, Hermione.

16:31.297 --> 16:35.009
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

16:35.176 --> 16:37.261
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

16:37.428 --> 16:40.431
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

16:40.598 --> 16:43.142
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

16:43.309 --> 16:45.853
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.439
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

16:48.647 --> 16:50.232
Harry.

16:51.317 --> 16:52.735
Harry.

16:53.903 --> 16:56.989
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

16:57.198 --> 17:00.534
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

17:00.743 --> 17:03.913
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.249
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

17:07.415 --> 17:09.835
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.420
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

17:11.587 --> 17:13.714
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

17:13.881 --> 17:15.299
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.635
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

17:17.801 --> 17:19.136
- Got everything?
- Yes.

17:19.303 --> 17:21.472
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

17:21.638 --> 17:23.057
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

17:23.223 --> 17:24.642
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

17:24.809 --> 17:26.685
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

17:26.852 --> 17:30.356
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

17:30.564 --> 17:33.192
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

17:33.359 --> 17:36.987
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

17:40.074 --> 17:43.911
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

17:44.078 --> 17:46.747
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

17:46.914 --> 17:50.251
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.003
You are in danger.

17:53.671 --> 17:56.131
Grave danger.

17:56.632 --> 17:59.260
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

18:00.094 --> 18:02.471
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

18:02.638 --> 18:06.350
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

18:07.059 --> 18:09.854
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

18:10.020 --> 18:11.856
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

18:12.022 --> 18:13.357
Sorry.

18:13.524 --> 18:16.443
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

18:16.610 --> 18:18.237
...Black lost everything.

18:18.404 --> 18:22.700
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

18:22.867 --> 18:25.035
And in his mind...

18:25.202 --> 18:28.205
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

18:28.372 --> 18:32.126
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

18:32.293 --> 18:34.461
And that is why...

18:34.628 --> 18:37.173
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

18:37.506 --> 18:39.216
To find you.

18:40.676 --> 18:42.303
And kill me.

18:43.262 --> 18:45.931
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

18:46.098 --> 18:48.642
...you won't go looking for Black.

18:49.018 --> 18:50.352
Mr. Weasley...

18:50.519 --> 18:54.523
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

18:55.316 --> 18:56.942
Quick. Quick.

18:57.234 --> 18:59.069
Ron, Ron!

18:59.778 --> 19:01.864
Oh, for goodness' sake!

19:02.072 --> 19:04.533
Don't lose him!

19:05.576 --> 19:07.661
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

19:07.828 --> 19:10.289
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

19:10.456 --> 19:14.043
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

19:14.210 --> 19:15.961
I was lucky not to be arrested.

19:16.128 --> 19:18.172
I still think it was brilliant.

19:18.756 --> 19:21.091
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

19:23.928 --> 19:25.304
Who do you think that is?

19:25.471 --> 19:28.349
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

19:28.516 --> 19:30.643
How is it she knows everything?

19:30.810 --> 19:33.938
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

19:34.230 --> 19:37.525
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

19:39.235 --> 19:41.362
I gotta tell you something.

19:54.583 --> 19:57.920
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

19:58.087 --> 19:59.922
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

20:00.089 --> 20:02.091
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

20:02.258 --> 20:04.969
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

20:05.136 --> 20:08.472
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

20:08.639 --> 20:12.643
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

20:14.103 --> 20:15.729
Why are we stopping?

20:16.772 --> 20:18.524
We can't be there yet.

20:22.778 --> 20:24.989
What's going on?

20:25.197 --> 20:27.867
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

20:29.785 --> 20:32.121
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

20:32.997 --> 20:34.915
There's something moving out there.

20:48.512 --> 20:51.557
I think someone's coming aboard.

21:16.749 --> 21:19.627
Bloody hell! What's happening?

22:31.907 --> 22:33.325
Harry.

22:34.410 --> 22:36.245
Harry, are you all right?

22:42.418 --> 22:44.086
Thank you.

22:45.254 --> 22:47.715
Here, eat this. It'll help.

22:48.215 --> 22:50.342
It's all right. It's chocolate.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.726
What was that thing that came?

22:58.893 --> 23:02.313
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.191
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

23:05.357 --> 23:08.986
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

23:13.574 --> 23:16.494
Eat. You'll feel better.

23:22.291 --> 23:23.626
What happened to me?

23:23.792 --> 23:25.544
Well, you sort of went rigid.

23:25.711 --> 23:28.881
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

23:30.633 --> 23:32.426
And did either of you two...

23:32.593 --> 23:33.928
...you know...

23:34.094 --> 23:37.181
...pass out?
- No.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.058
I felt weird, though.

23:39.225 --> 23:41.060
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

23:42.311 --> 23:44.522
But someone was screaming.

23:44.688 --> 23:46.065
A woman.

23:47.024 --> 23:49.026
No one was screaming, Harry.

24:48.210 --> 24:51.964
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

24:52.173 --> 24:54.216
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

24:54.383 --> 24:58.721
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

24:58.888 --> 25:02.141
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

25:02.349 --> 25:04.768
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

25:04.977 --> 25:07.438
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

25:07.605 --> 25:10.149
Good luck, professor.

25:14.737 --> 25:18.073
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.910
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

25:21.744 --> 25:24.747
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.916
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

25:27.082 --> 25:29.460
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

25:29.668 --> 25:31.545
...has decided to retire...

25:31.712 --> 25:35.466
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

25:35.674 --> 25:38.385
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

25:38.552 --> 25:41.388
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

25:41.555 --> 25:45.893
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

25:57.154 --> 25:59.949
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

26:00.157 --> 26:02.660
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

26:02.868 --> 26:08.040
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

26:08.707 --> 26:12.169
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

26:13.128 --> 26:16.799
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.634
Now whilst I've been assured...

26:18.801 --> 26:22.471
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

26:22.638 --> 26:23.973
...a word of caution.

26:24.181 --> 26:27.351
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

26:27.518 --> 26:30.938
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

26:31.105 --> 26:34.733
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

26:34.900 --> 26:38.529
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

26:39.280 --> 26:44.410
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

26:46.537 --> 26:49.832
But you know,
happiness can be found...

26:49.999 --> 26:53.627
...even in the darkest of times...

26:54.837 --> 26:58.716
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

27:10.728 --> 27:12.730
Fortuna Major.

27:15.566 --> 27:18.235
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

27:18.444 --> 27:21.363
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

27:21.530 --> 27:23.365
Watch this.

27:34.126 --> 27:39.089
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

27:39.298 --> 27:42.843
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

27:44.845 --> 27:46.847
Still doing that after three years.

27:47.014 --> 27:49.183
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

27:50.392 --> 27:52.561
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

27:53.604 --> 27:54.980
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.108
Green. That's a monkey.

27:59.902 --> 28:02.571
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

28:02.738 --> 28:04.949
Do not give him one again.

28:05.115 --> 28:07.743
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

28:14.834 --> 28:16.585
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

28:22.258 --> 28:23.884
I think we have a winner.

28:24.844 --> 28:27.179
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

28:27.805 --> 28:30.307
Look at him. His face.

29:13.934 --> 29:16.187
Welcome, my children.

29:16.395 --> 29:21.484
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

29:21.650 --> 29:26.947
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

29:28.365 --> 29:32.328
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

29:32.495 --> 29:37.124
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

29:37.333 --> 29:41.170
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

29:41.337 --> 29:44.924
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

29:45.424 --> 29:46.801
What do you see?

29:46.967 --> 29:52.640
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

29:52.848 --> 29:55.267
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

29:55.434 --> 29:59.980
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

30:00.147 --> 30:02.066
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

30:02.233 --> 30:04.902
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

30:05.069 --> 30:07.363
Is your grandmother quite well?

30:08.030 --> 30:09.490
I think so.

30:09.657 --> 30:12.451
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

30:15.454 --> 30:16.831
Pity.

30:17.039 --> 30:19.667
Broaden your minds.

30:23.254 --> 30:26.590
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

30:26.757 --> 30:28.676
- I think you are.
- Sure.

30:28.884 --> 30:31.095
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

30:31.262 --> 30:32.972
Yeah.

30:33.806 --> 30:38.227
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

30:38.686 --> 30:42.314
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

30:42.523 --> 30:43.858
So...

30:44.024 --> 30:48.070
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.613
Give me the cup.

30:52.199 --> 30:54.076
Oh, my dear boy.

30:56.162 --> 30:57.830
My dear...

30:59.498 --> 31:02.585
...you have the Grim.

31:03.419 --> 31:05.171
The Grin? What's the Grin?

31:05.337 --> 31:08.215
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

31:08.382 --> 31:10.551
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

31:10.759 --> 31:13.220
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

31:13.762 --> 31:15.431
It's an omen...

31:15.598 --> 31:17.433
...of death."

31:21.937 --> 31:25.774
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

31:25.941 --> 31:29.904
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

31:30.070 --> 31:33.741
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

31:33.908 --> 31:37.036
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

31:37.203 --> 31:38.871
A fair few.

31:39.038 --> 31:41.123
Hang on. That's not possible.

31:41.290 --> 31:44.084
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

31:44.251 --> 31:46.253
You have to be in two
classes at once.

31:46.420 --> 31:49.799
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

31:49.965 --> 31:54.220
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

31:55.387 --> 31:59.350
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.352
I got a real treat for you today.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.521
A great lesson. So follow me.

32:14.782 --> 32:17.868
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

32:18.035 --> 32:20.538
And open your books to page 49.

32:20.704 --> 32:22.331
Exactly how do we do that?

32:22.540 --> 32:26.418
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

32:35.803 --> 32:39.598
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

32:43.269 --> 32:46.480
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

32:46.689 --> 32:49.150
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

32:49.358 --> 32:53.028
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

32:53.988 --> 32:55.322
Shut up, Malfoy.

33:09.837 --> 33:11.881
Dementor! Dementor!

33:19.889 --> 33:22.975
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

33:23.142 --> 33:24.602
Yeah.

33:34.820 --> 33:37.823
Isn't he beautiful?

33:37.990 --> 33:40.618
Say hello to Buckbeak.

33:41.202 --> 33:43.454
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

33:43.662 --> 33:45.706
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

33:45.873 --> 33:49.376
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

33:49.585 --> 33:53.464
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.383
It may be the last thing you ever do.

33:56.550 --> 33:59.929
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

34:02.473 --> 34:04.558
Well done, Harry. Well done.

34:07.353 --> 34:08.728
Come on now.

34:09.271 --> 34:10.606
Now...

34:10.815 --> 34:14.527
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

34:14.693 --> 34:16.570
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

34:16.779 --> 34:19.197
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

34:19.364 --> 34:21.492
If he does, you can go and touch him.

34:21.659 --> 34:24.870
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.583
Just make your bow.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.837
Nice and low.

34:38.175 --> 34:39.844
Back off, Harry. Back off.

34:41.719 --> 34:43.222
Keep still.

34:44.889 --> 34:46.891
Keep still.

34:55.067 --> 34:59.488
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

35:01.991 --> 35:04.535
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

35:04.743 --> 35:06.579
Go on. Don't be shy.

35:15.004 --> 35:17.465
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

35:20.801 --> 35:22.219
Not so fast, Harry.

35:27.308 --> 35:30.561
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

35:30.769 --> 35:33.939
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

35:35.816 --> 35:38.152
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

35:38.360 --> 35:40.154
That's it...

35:40.779 --> 35:42.114
Yes!

35:42.698 --> 35:46.118
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

35:46.285 --> 35:48.287
Does he get to fly?

35:48.496 --> 35:50.873
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

35:51.081 --> 35:52.625
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

35:52.791 --> 35:55.961
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

35:56.629 --> 36:01.008
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

37:41.942 --> 37:45.446
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.573
That was wicked, Harry!

37:47.781 --> 37:49.158
Oh, please.

37:49.950 --> 37:52.286
Well done, well done.

37:52.953 --> 37:56.165
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

37:59.585 --> 38:03.798
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

38:04.006 --> 38:05.382
Malfoy, no...

38:06.300 --> 38:07.760
No!

38:08.469 --> 38:10.095
Buckbeak!

38:10.304 --> 38:12.431
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

38:13.599 --> 38:15.392
Whoa! Buckbeak!

38:16.519 --> 38:18.854
Away, you silly creature...

38:19.063 --> 38:22.149
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

38:22.358 --> 38:23.567
Hagrid!

38:23.734 --> 38:28.948
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

38:31.992 --> 38:34.870
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

38:35.037 --> 38:37.331
You and your bloody chicken!

39:00.813 --> 39:02.857
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

39:03.065 --> 39:06.902
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

39:07.069 --> 39:10.406
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

39:10.739 --> 39:13.617
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

39:13.868 --> 39:18.122
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

39:18.330 --> 39:22.042
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

39:22.251 --> 39:24.086
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

39:24.295 --> 39:26.005
Sirius Black!

39:27.047 --> 39:30.050
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

39:30.468 --> 39:33.095
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

39:33.262 --> 39:35.764
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

39:35.931 --> 39:39.268
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

39:39.477 --> 39:44.023
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

39:44.815 --> 39:47.985
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

40:14.094 --> 40:16.180
Intriguing, isn't it?

40:19.433 --> 40:22.186
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

40:22.353 --> 40:24.146
...as to what is inside?

40:24.355 --> 40:28.359
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

40:29.109 --> 40:32.029
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

40:32.238 --> 40:34.281
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

40:34.490 --> 40:35.991
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.411
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

40:39.620 --> 40:44.041
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

40:44.250 --> 40:49.713
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

40:51.090 --> 40:54.844
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

40:55.136 --> 40:57.638
After me. Riddikulus!

40:57.847 --> 40:59.974
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

41:00.182 --> 41:02.685
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

41:02.893 --> 41:05.104
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

41:05.312 --> 41:07.398
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

41:07.606 --> 41:11.610
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

41:11.819 --> 41:15.531
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

41:15.739 --> 41:20.161
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

41:20.327 --> 41:24.456
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

41:24.665 --> 41:27.001
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

41:28.002 --> 41:29.670
Come on.

41:30.129 --> 41:33.632
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

41:33.841 --> 41:35.509
Professor Snape.

41:35.718 --> 41:37.553
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.140
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

41:41.307 --> 41:45.811
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

41:46.312 --> 41:47.897
No...

41:48.731 --> 41:51.525
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

41:51.775 --> 41:54.987
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

41:55.196 --> 41:58.282
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

41:58.449 --> 42:02.328
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

42:02.536 --> 42:05.831
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

42:06.290 --> 42:09.210
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

42:09.418 --> 42:11.128
Can you do that?

42:11.712 --> 42:14.423
Yes. Wand at the ready.

42:14.757 --> 42:18.260
One, two, three.

42:28.062 --> 42:29.939
Think, Neville, think.

42:32.691 --> 42:34.735
Riddikulus!

42:39.281 --> 42:41.951
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

42:42.159 --> 42:45.079
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

42:51.293 --> 42:52.628
Form a line!

42:52.795 --> 42:56.215
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

42:56.423 --> 42:59.510
...and turn it into something funny.

42:59.718 --> 43:01.428
Next! Ron!

43:04.640 --> 43:08.185
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

43:19.655 --> 43:21.198
Wand at the ready, Ron.

43:21.949 --> 43:23.784
Riddikulus!

43:23.951 --> 43:25.286
Yes!

43:25.911 --> 43:28.789
You see? Very good, very good!

43:29.290 --> 43:35.129
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

43:36.922 --> 43:39.133
Show us what you see.

43:48.392 --> 43:51.812
Keep your nerve. Steady.

43:51.979 --> 43:53.939
Riddikulus!

43:54.982 --> 43:56.942
And next! Step up, step up!

43:58.027 --> 43:59.862
Wonderful, wonderful!

44:13.876 --> 44:16.003
Here!

44:21.842 --> 44:23.677
Riddikulus!

44:32.186 --> 44:35.105
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

44:35.272 --> 44:37.274
Collect your books from the back.

44:37.441 --> 44:40.069
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

44:40.236 --> 44:43.280
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

44:45.282 --> 44:49.870
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

44:50.162 --> 44:52.998
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

44:53.165 --> 44:56.085
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

44:56.544 --> 44:59.839
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

45:00.005 --> 45:01.549
That's the rule, Potter.

45:01.757 --> 45:04.969
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.638
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

45:07.805 --> 45:10.307
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.686
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

45:15.980 --> 45:20.568
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

45:21.777 --> 45:25.030
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

45:38.836 --> 45:40.880
Professor, can I ask you something?

45:41.088 --> 45:44.925
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

45:45.134 --> 45:46.552
I thought it'd be obvious.

45:46.719 --> 45:49.555
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

45:49.722 --> 45:53.225
I did think of Voldemort at first.

45:53.434 --> 45:56.061
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

45:56.228 --> 45:58.772
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

45:58.939 --> 46:01.817
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

46:01.984 --> 46:03.486
This is very wise.

46:03.652 --> 46:05.738
Before I fainted...

46:05.988 --> 46:07.990
...I heard something.

46:08.532 --> 46:10.159
A woman...

46:10.618 --> 46:11.952
...screaming.

46:12.161 --> 46:15.414
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

46:15.623 --> 46:18.542
Our pain becomes their power.

46:19.376 --> 46:21.587
I think it was my mother...

46:21.754 --> 46:23.964
...the night she was murdered.

46:25.591 --> 46:30.054
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

46:30.638 --> 46:33.474
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

46:33.891 --> 46:36.060
They're your mother, Lily's.

46:36.977 --> 46:38.437
Yes.

46:38.771 --> 46:41.774
Oh, yes. I knew her.

46:44.109 --> 46:47.947
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

46:48.155 --> 46:51.367
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

46:51.534 --> 46:54.870
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

46:55.371 --> 46:58.457
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

46:58.624 --> 47:04.797
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

47:06.257 --> 47:08.968
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

47:09.135 --> 47:10.678
...he...

47:11.178 --> 47:14.515
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

47:16.809 --> 47:22.314
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

47:26.318 --> 47:29.280
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

47:30.114 --> 47:33.242
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

47:36.704 --> 47:41.083
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

47:41.292 --> 47:43.836
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

47:44.003 --> 47:48.048
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

47:49.425 --> 47:50.926
What's going on?

47:51.093 --> 47:53.554
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

47:53.721 --> 47:56.140
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

47:56.307 --> 48:00.603
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

48:02.229 --> 48:03.898
Get back, all of you.

48:04.064 --> 48:07.234
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

48:07.401 --> 48:08.736
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

48:10.821 --> 48:13.282
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

48:13.449 --> 48:15.367
It's not funny, Ron.

48:17.369 --> 48:21.457
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

48:27.797 --> 48:28.839
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

48:29.048 --> 48:31.008
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

48:31.217 --> 48:33.093
You heard. Move!

48:47.316 --> 48:50.194
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

48:50.528 --> 48:54.615
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

48:54.824 --> 48:57.910
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

48:58.744 --> 49:00.871
The Fat Lady's there.

49:01.705 --> 49:03.707
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

49:04.291 --> 49:06.961
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

49:07.128 --> 49:09.547
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

49:13.134 --> 49:16.011
Dear lady, who did this to you?

49:17.930 --> 49:22.977
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

49:23.894 --> 49:26.897
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

49:27.064 --> 49:29.525
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

49:29.775 --> 49:31.944
Sirius Black!

49:32.153 --> 49:37.283
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

50:05.352 --> 50:10.274
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

50:10.441 --> 50:13.027
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

50:13.194 --> 50:15.154
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

50:15.321 --> 50:17.990
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

50:18.199 --> 50:20.701
I didn't really expect him to linger.

50:21.952 --> 50:24.288
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

50:24.455 --> 50:26.749
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

50:26.916 --> 50:29.585
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

50:29.794 --> 50:31.629
Any theories on how he managed it?

50:31.837 --> 50:34.799
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

50:35.049 --> 50:36.592
You may recall...

50:36.759 --> 50:39.595
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

50:39.762 --> 50:41.847
...about your appointment
of Professor...

50:42.014 --> 50:46.101
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

50:46.268 --> 50:48.687
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

50:48.854 --> 50:52.483
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.985
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

50:55.194 --> 50:57.822
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

50:58.697 --> 51:03.410
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

51:03.702 --> 51:10.209
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

51:47.538 --> 51:50.875
Turn to page 394.

52:00.301 --> 52:03.888
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

52:04.597 --> 52:08.017
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

52:08.184 --> 52:12.062
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

52:12.271 --> 52:17.318
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

52:22.156 --> 52:23.824
"Werewolves"?

52:24.158 --> 52:26.911
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

52:27.161 --> 52:30.289
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

52:30.498 --> 52:33.667
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

52:34.293 --> 52:37.797
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

52:38.005 --> 52:40.424
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

52:41.133 --> 52:43.052
No one?

52:43.552 --> 52:46.472
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

52:46.680 --> 52:49.850
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

52:50.017 --> 52:51.560
A werewolf has no choice.

52:51.977 --> 52:53.687
With each full moon...

52:53.854 --> 52:57.733
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

52:57.942 --> 53:01.529
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

53:02.696 --> 53:05.449
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

53:05.616 --> 53:07.952
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

53:08.118 --> 53:10.121
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

53:10.287 --> 53:13.624
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

53:13.916 --> 53:17.336
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

53:17.545 --> 53:22.133
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

53:22.341 --> 53:26.053
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

53:26.220 --> 53:28.806
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

53:29.890 --> 53:33.227
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

53:33.435 --> 53:37.481
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

53:37.690 --> 53:41.443
Page 394.

53:43.445 --> 53:44.905
The term "werewolf"...

53:45.823 --> 53:50.327
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

53:51.078 --> 53:55.499
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

53:56.167 --> 53:58.502
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

53:58.711 --> 54:01.714
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

54:01.964 --> 54:03.883
...being bitten by a werewolf...

54:22.693 --> 54:26.322
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

56:26.108 --> 56:28.944
Aresto momentum!

56:31.197 --> 56:34.325
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

56:34.492 --> 56:36.786
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

56:36.952 --> 56:39.830
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

56:40.039 --> 56:43.083
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

56:46.754 --> 56:49.715
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

56:49.924 --> 56:51.884
You gave us a right good scare.

56:52.134 --> 56:55.638
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

56:55.930 --> 56:58.265
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

57:02.686 --> 57:04.396
No one blames you, Harry.

57:04.605 --> 57:08.442
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

57:08.651 --> 57:10.736
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

57:10.903 --> 57:14.573
There's something else
you should know too.

57:15.115 --> 57:21.455
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

57:21.956 --> 57:23.457
Well...

57:24.708 --> 57:27.002
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

57:27.336 --> 57:29.964
Is there no chance of fixing it?

57:30.131 --> 57:31.507
No.

57:31.674 --> 57:35.010
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

57:35.427 --> 57:38.514
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

57:38.681 --> 57:41.851
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

57:42.059 --> 57:46.313
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

57:46.856 --> 57:51.443
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

57:51.652 --> 57:55.865
You are not weak, Harry.

57:56.031 --> 58:00.119
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

58:00.327 --> 58:03.414
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

58:03.873 --> 58:06.167
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

58:06.375 --> 58:10.421
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

58:10.588 --> 58:14.091
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

58:14.258 --> 58:16.260
You made the one
on the train go away.

58:16.469 --> 58:18.220
There was only one that night.

58:18.512 --> 58:23.100
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

58:23.434 --> 58:28.397
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

58:28.564 --> 58:32.234
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

58:32.401 --> 58:34.320
For now, I need to rest.

58:59.762 --> 59:04.058
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

59:19.657 --> 59:21.659
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

59:21.826 --> 59:24.745
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

59:24.912 --> 59:27.748
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

59:27.915 --> 59:29.125
We'll get you there.

59:29.291 --> 59:32.002
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

59:32.169 --> 59:35.756
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

59:36.382 --> 59:38.968
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

59:40.386 --> 59:42.513
What are you doing?!

59:42.763 --> 59:45.599
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

59:45.766 --> 59:49.103
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

59:49.270 --> 59:52.189
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

59:52.356 --> 59:54.108
George, if you will.

59:54.275 --> 59:57.570
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:04.785
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:08.164
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

01:00:08.414 --> 01:00:10.666
We owe them so much.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:18.048
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:20.676
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

01:00:20.843 --> 01:00:22.178
- In his study.
- Pacing.

01:00:22.344 --> 01:00:24.305
Does that a lot.

01:00:24.513 --> 01:00:26.348
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:28.559
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:29.852
- Every minute.
- Every day.

01:00:30.019 --> 01:00:33.022
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

01:00:33.189 --> 01:00:35.941
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

01:00:36.108 --> 01:00:38.777
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

01:00:38.944 --> 01:00:42.114
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

01:00:42.281 --> 01:00:44.116
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

01:00:44.283 --> 01:00:47.703
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:52.208
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

01:01:27.535 --> 01:01:29.745
Now, how much do you want?

01:01:37.044 --> 01:01:38.963
Delicious.

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:51.058
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

01:01:51.225 --> 01:01:52.893
Twice.

01:01:53.602 --> 01:01:55.938
Do you want to move a bit closer?

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.857
To the Shrieking Shack?

01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:01.026
Actually, I'm fine here.

01:02:01.193 --> 01:02:03.028
Well, well. Look who's here.

01:02:03.404 --> 01:02:05.698
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

01:02:05.906 --> 01:02:10.202
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

01:02:10.411 --> 01:02:13.622
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

01:02:13.914 --> 01:02:19.044
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

01:02:19.253 --> 01:02:22.673
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.842
You filthy little mudblood!

01:02:29.054 --> 01:02:30.598
Who is that?

01:02:36.812 --> 01:02:39.190
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:01.295
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

01:03:05.257 --> 01:03:06.675
Get out of the way!

01:03:06.842 --> 01:03:08.469
Move!

01:03:08.928 --> 01:03:11.931
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

01:03:15.684 --> 01:03:17.645
Harry!

01:03:17.812 --> 01:03:21.857
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

01:03:23.025 --> 01:03:26.278
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

01:03:26.487 --> 01:03:29.907
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

01:03:30.157 --> 01:03:34.120
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

01:03:34.286 --> 01:03:36.789
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

01:03:36.997 --> 01:03:39.291
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:41.335
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

01:03:41.502 --> 01:03:42.878
Allow me, minister.

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:44.922
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:48.050
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:52.138
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

01:03:52.304 --> 01:03:56.350
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:59.979
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

01:04:00.312 --> 01:04:02.773
And what would bring him here?

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.111
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:09.029
Come.

01:04:11.574 --> 01:04:13.576
Harry!

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:25.754
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:27.965
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

01:04:28.215 --> 01:04:29.800
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

01:04:30.009 --> 01:04:33.179
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

01:04:33.929 --> 01:04:37.850
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

01:04:38.017 --> 01:04:41.937
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:46.525
Tell me what this is all about.

01:04:46.692 --> 01:04:51.155
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:53.991
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.037
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

01:04:58.245 --> 01:05:01.457
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

01:05:01.624 --> 01:05:05.002
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

01:05:05.252 --> 01:05:07.421
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

01:05:07.588 --> 01:05:09.840
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.842
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:14.762
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

01:05:14.929 --> 01:05:19.099
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

01:05:19.308 --> 01:05:23.145
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:25.523
He destroyed him!

01:05:26.148 --> 01:05:30.903
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:34.115
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

01:05:34.281 --> 01:05:37.493
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.538
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

01:05:40.746 --> 01:05:44.500
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.836
...and remains to this day...

01:05:47.294 --> 01:05:48.921
...Harry Potter's godfather!

01:05:57.555 --> 01:05:59.849
Ron, look!

01:06:05.563 --> 01:06:08.149
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

01:06:46.604 --> 01:06:48.439
Harry, what happened?

01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:53.068
He was their friend...

01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:55.821
...and he betrayed them.

01:06:56.614 --> 01:06:58.574
He was their friend!

01:07:00.826 --> 01:07:02.787
I hope he finds me.

01:07:03.412 --> 01:07:05.748
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

01:07:06.207 --> 01:07:08.834
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

01:07:23.098 --> 01:07:24.725
Harry.

01:07:25.226 --> 01:07:26.894
There you are. You came.

01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:31.148
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:33.776
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

01:07:33.943 --> 01:07:35.486
I'm sure.

01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:38.531
Well, everything's prepared.

01:07:38.781 --> 01:07:42.159
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

01:07:42.368 --> 01:07:43.828
Did you ever hear of it?

01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:45.663
No? Well...

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:49.416
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:54.255
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:58.259
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

01:07:58.425 --> 01:08:02.388
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

01:08:02.596 --> 01:08:06.392
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:09.812
Close your eyes.

01:08:11.605 --> 01:08:13.482
Concentrate.

01:08:14.733 --> 01:08:16.819
Explore your past.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:19.196
Do you have a memory?

01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:22.992
Allow it to fill you up.

01:08:23.701 --> 01:08:25.786
Lose yourself within it.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:31.459
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

01:08:31.876 --> 01:08:34.712
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

01:08:38.506 --> 01:08:41.844
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:02.281
Expecto Patronum!

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.410
Expecto... Expecto...

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.370
Expect...

01:09:10.372 --> 01:09:14.460
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

01:09:14.752 --> 01:09:18.546
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

01:09:18.964 --> 01:09:24.094
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

01:09:24.929 --> 01:09:27.807
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:09:28.015 --> 01:09:30.768
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

01:09:30.935 --> 01:09:34.104
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.899
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

01:09:37.066 --> 01:09:40.778
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

01:09:41.987 --> 01:09:45.323
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

01:09:52.206 --> 01:09:57.461
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.507
Well, it is.

01:10:01.674 --> 01:10:04.260
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

01:10:04.426 --> 01:10:08.389
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

01:10:12.768 --> 01:10:15.604
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

01:10:17.398 --> 01:10:19.150
Just do it.

01:10:29.201 --> 01:10:32.455
Expecto Patronum!

01:10:33.706 --> 01:10:37.668
Expecto Patronum!

01:10:59.273 --> 01:11:00.357
Yes!

01:11:02.318 --> 01:11:05.738
Well done, Harry. Well done!

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.409
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:12.995
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

01:11:13.162 --> 01:11:14.955
And just so you know, Harry...

01:11:15.122 --> 01:11:19.126
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

01:11:19.293 --> 01:11:21.337
...is saying something.

01:11:23.506 --> 01:11:25.508
I was thinking of him.

01:11:25.674 --> 01:11:27.843
And Mum.

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:30.262
Seeing their faces.

01:11:30.888 --> 01:11:33.599
They were talking to me.

01:11:33.766 --> 01:11:36.018
Just talking.

01:11:36.185 --> 01:11:38.521
That's the memory I chose.

01:11:40.147 --> 01:11:42.608
I don't even know if it's real.

01:11:43.108 --> 01:11:45.277
But it's the best I have.

01:11:54.495 --> 01:11:56.831
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

01:11:56.997 --> 01:11:58.999
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:01.585
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

01:12:01.752 --> 01:12:04.922
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

01:12:05.089 --> 01:12:07.216
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

01:12:07.383 --> 01:12:10.719
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

01:12:10.886 --> 01:12:14.807
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

01:12:14.974 --> 01:12:17.852
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

01:12:18.018 --> 01:12:20.104
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

01:12:20.271 --> 01:12:21.772
- Did.
- Didn't.

01:12:23.816 --> 01:12:26.443
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:29.905
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

01:12:30.072 --> 01:12:32.741
...talking about why we were there.

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:37.288
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

01:12:37.455 --> 01:12:40.416
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:43.669
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

01:12:43.836 --> 01:12:47.047
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

01:12:47.214 --> 01:12:50.259
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

01:12:50.468 --> 01:12:52.261
And then?

01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:55.681
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

01:12:55.848 --> 01:12:59.977
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

01:13:02.062 --> 01:13:05.065
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:37.473
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:40.226
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

01:13:40.434 --> 01:13:44.396
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:04.708
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:08.003
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

01:14:08.212 --> 01:14:10.673
He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

01:14:18.764 --> 01:14:22.226
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

01:15:05.478 --> 01:15:09.607
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

01:15:17.823 --> 01:15:20.409
Mischief managed. Nox.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.954
Potter.

01:15:24.121 --> 01:15:27.625
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:28.959
I was sleepwalking.

01:15:29.126 --> 01:15:31.670
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

01:15:31.837 --> 01:15:36.592
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

01:15:36.801 --> 01:15:41.138
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

01:15:41.889 --> 01:15:44.975
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

01:15:48.604 --> 01:15:50.397
Turn out your pockets.

01:15:52.107 --> 01:15:54.693
Turn out your pockets!

01:15:57.655 --> 01:15:59.281
What's this?

01:15:59.448 --> 01:16:02.701
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:12.920
Reveal your secrets.

01:16:16.757 --> 01:16:18.217
Read it.

01:16:20.678 --> 01:16:26.183
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:30.479
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

01:16:30.771 --> 01:16:32.231
Go on.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.278
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

01:16:37.528 --> 01:16:40.030
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

01:16:41.699 --> 01:16:44.368
Well, well. Lupin.

01:16:44.577 --> 01:16:49.290
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

01:16:50.666 --> 01:16:53.043
Harry, are you all right?

01:16:53.294 --> 01:16:55.713
That remains to be seen.

01:16:56.589 --> 01:17:00.342
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

01:17:00.509 --> 01:17:04.013
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

01:17:04.221 --> 01:17:09.018
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

01:17:09.185 --> 01:17:12.688
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

01:17:12.855 --> 01:17:16.692
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

01:17:16.901 --> 01:17:21.113
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

01:17:21.322 --> 01:17:24.408
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

01:17:24.617 --> 01:17:27.953
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

01:17:33.959 --> 01:17:36.712
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

01:17:41.801 --> 01:17:43.260
Come in.

01:17:45.054 --> 01:17:50.226
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

01:17:50.434 --> 01:17:54.897
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

01:17:55.105 --> 01:17:58.734
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

01:17:58.943 --> 01:18:00.903
...is a map to you?

01:18:01.779 --> 01:18:04.240
- No.
- No, sir.

01:18:06.242 --> 01:18:09.245
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

01:18:09.453 --> 01:18:13.749
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:18.462
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

01:18:18.671 --> 01:18:23.134
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

01:18:23.342 --> 01:18:25.469
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

01:18:25.678 --> 01:18:28.097
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

01:18:28.305 --> 01:18:31.934
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:36.856
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

01:18:41.569 --> 01:18:45.948
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

01:18:46.866 --> 01:18:51.787
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

01:18:52.246 --> 01:18:54.999
Oh, really? And who might that be?

01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:56.709
Peter Pettigrew.

01:18:59.336 --> 01:19:01.380
That's not possible.

01:19:02.631 --> 01:19:04.258
It's just what I saw.

01:19:07.136 --> 01:19:08.846
Good night, professor.

01:19:12.349 --> 01:19:16.479
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

01:19:16.687 --> 01:19:22.109
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:25.613
Only then can you see. Try again.

01:19:26.155 --> 01:19:28.199
Now, what do we have here?

01:19:30.576 --> 01:19:32.787
Do you mind me trying?

01:19:35.206 --> 01:19:38.125
The Grim, possibly.

01:19:40.336 --> 01:19:44.381
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:48.344
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

01:19:48.552 --> 01:19:52.431
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.268
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

01:19:56.477 --> 01:20:00.439
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

01:20:00.648 --> 01:20:03.734
...to which you so desperately cleave.

01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:21.252
Have I said something?

01:20:25.965 --> 01:20:30.928
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

01:20:31.137 --> 01:20:33.681
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

01:20:33.889 --> 01:20:36.016
Hang on.

01:20:36.267 --> 01:20:39.103
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

01:20:39.478 --> 01:20:42.898
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

01:21:20.644 --> 01:21:25.900
Harry Potter...

01:21:32.823 --> 01:21:37.036
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

01:21:37.244 --> 01:21:38.871
Sorry?

01:21:39.079 --> 01:21:43.709
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

01:21:43.876 --> 01:21:45.920
...shall break free.

01:21:46.086 --> 01:21:48.297
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

01:21:48.506 --> 01:21:54.512
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

01:22:00.851 --> 01:22:04.104
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

01:22:04.897 --> 01:22:06.690
No.

01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:08.692
Nothing.

01:23:01.287 --> 01:23:05.332
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

01:23:05.499 --> 01:23:08.252
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

01:23:08.419 --> 01:23:12.548
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

01:23:12.756 --> 01:23:15.217
This is going to be rich.

01:23:15.426 --> 01:23:17.553
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

01:23:17.761 --> 01:23:20.848
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

01:23:21.056 --> 01:23:22.766
Hermione, no!

01:23:23.392 --> 01:23:25.603
He's not worth it.

01:23:39.742 --> 01:23:41.786
Malfoy, are you okay?

01:23:41.994 --> 01:23:46.207
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

01:23:46.373 --> 01:23:50.753
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

01:24:10.231 --> 01:24:14.527
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

01:24:14.693 --> 01:24:16.946
Why don't we just set him free?

01:24:17.154 --> 01:24:19.532
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.743
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:25.287
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

01:24:26.288 --> 01:24:28.332
When it happens.

01:24:28.499 --> 01:24:29.792
Great man, Dumbledore.

01:24:30.835 --> 01:24:32.378
A great man.

01:24:34.839 --> 01:24:37.842
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

01:24:38.008 --> 01:24:41.178
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

01:24:41.345 --> 01:24:44.974
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.775
Scabbers! You're alive!

01:24:54.984 --> 01:24:58.654
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

01:24:58.863 --> 01:25:02.616
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

01:25:02.783 --> 01:25:03.826
I meant me!

01:25:04.577 --> 01:25:06.787
Blimey. What was that?

01:25:13.252 --> 01:25:14.628
Hagrid!

01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:17.882
Oh, crikey.

01:25:19.383 --> 01:25:22.136
No, minister. Over this way.

01:25:22.344 --> 01:25:26.390
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

01:25:26.599 --> 01:25:30.352
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

01:25:30.561 --> 01:25:34.148
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

01:25:35.566 --> 01:25:37.943
Quick. Quick!

01:25:38.152 --> 01:25:39.862
Hagrid.

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:43.949
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

01:25:45.826 --> 01:25:48.579
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

01:25:48.788 --> 01:25:51.457
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:54.293
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

01:25:54.543 --> 01:25:58.380
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

01:26:00.466 --> 01:26:03.010
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.597
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

01:26:07.765 --> 01:26:11.352
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

01:26:11.519 --> 01:26:14.688
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:20.361
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

01:26:20.528 --> 01:26:24.031
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

01:26:24.281 --> 01:26:28.661
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

01:26:28.828 --> 01:26:30.538
What?

01:26:30.746 --> 01:26:32.790
I thought I just saw...

01:26:32.998 --> 01:26:35.126
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

01:26:40.214 --> 01:26:42.508
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

01:27:29.054 --> 01:27:30.514
Oh, no.

01:27:41.442 --> 01:27:43.652
He bit me. Scabbers.

01:27:44.236 --> 01:27:46.197
Ron. Ron!

01:27:47.156 --> 01:27:50.659
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

01:27:52.203 --> 01:27:53.913
Wait!

01:27:59.877 --> 01:28:04.173
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.634
That's not good. Ron, run!

01:28:09.762 --> 01:28:12.264
Harry, Hermione, run!

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:14.517
It's the Grim!

01:28:21.524 --> 01:28:24.527
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

01:28:24.777 --> 01:28:26.737
Harry!

01:28:28.364 --> 01:28:30.699
- Help!
- Ron!

01:28:32.868 --> 01:28:36.122
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:52.930
Come on!

01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:56.267
Move!

01:29:00.354 --> 01:29:02.064
Duck!

01:29:37.975 --> 01:29:40.269
Harry!

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.163
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:03.209
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

01:30:03.793 --> 01:30:05.252
I just hope I'm wrong.

01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:28.150
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

01:30:29.235 --> 01:30:30.861
Come on.

01:30:41.205 --> 01:30:42.581
Ron.

01:30:43.165 --> 01:30:45.751
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

01:30:46.001 --> 01:30:49.171
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

01:31:03.102 --> 01:31:05.855
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

01:31:06.063 --> 01:31:07.857
No. Only one will die tonight.

01:31:08.065 --> 01:31:09.942
Then it'll be you!

01:31:16.198 --> 01:31:18.325
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

01:31:19.577 --> 01:31:21.370
Expelliarmus!

01:31:25.124 --> 01:31:29.253
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

01:31:29.503 --> 01:31:32.506
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

01:31:33.132 --> 01:31:36.719
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

01:31:47.188 --> 01:31:48.189
- I found him.
- I know.

01:31:48.397 --> 01:31:49.648
- It's him.
- I understand.

01:31:49.857 --> 01:31:53.027
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

01:31:53.486 --> 01:31:57.239
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

01:31:57.948 --> 01:32:00.951
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

01:32:03.788 --> 01:32:05.498
How long have you known?

01:32:05.998 --> 01:32:09.168
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

01:32:09.418 --> 01:32:12.338
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

01:32:12.505 --> 01:32:14.882
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

01:32:15.132 --> 01:32:17.718
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

01:32:17.927 --> 01:32:20.304
Twelve years of it!

01:32:20.971 --> 01:32:23.349
In Azkaban!

01:32:32.817 --> 01:32:34.527
Very well. Kill him.

01:32:35.152 --> 01:32:38.864
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

01:32:39.073 --> 01:32:40.616
I know why.

01:32:40.866 --> 01:32:43.077
You betrayed my parents.

01:32:43.285 --> 01:32:46.205
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

01:32:46.372 --> 01:32:48.249
Somebody did betray your parents...

01:32:48.457 --> 01:32:51.961
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

01:32:52.169 --> 01:32:55.589
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

01:32:55.798 --> 01:32:58.884
And he's in this room! Right now!

01:32:59.426 --> 01:33:02.346
Come out, come out, Peter!

01:33:02.555 --> 01:33:05.558
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

01:33:08.519 --> 01:33:10.980
Vengeance is sweet.

01:33:11.188 --> 01:33:13.399
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

01:33:13.607 --> 01:33:14.900
Severus...

01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:19.822
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:21.323
Brilliant, Snape.

01:33:21.532 --> 01:33:25.911
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.789
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

01:33:28.956 --> 01:33:33.919
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

01:33:34.128 --> 01:33:36.672
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

01:33:36.922 --> 01:33:38.466
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

01:33:38.674 --> 01:33:41.051
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.762
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

01:33:44.346 --> 01:33:46.807
I could do it, you know.

01:33:47.308 --> 01:33:52.897
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

01:33:53.105 --> 01:33:55.775
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

01:33:55.983 --> 01:33:59.487
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

01:33:59.653 --> 01:34:05.075
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

01:34:05.284 --> 01:34:07.495
Severus, please.

01:34:08.579 --> 01:34:10.539
After you.

01:34:15.002 --> 01:34:16.712
Expelliarmus!

01:34:18.506 --> 01:34:22.092
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

01:34:22.301 --> 01:34:24.845
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

01:34:25.054 --> 01:34:26.680
We thought he was our friend!

01:34:26.889 --> 01:34:29.892
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

01:34:30.059 --> 01:34:33.229
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

01:34:33.479 --> 01:34:36.232
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.402
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

01:34:40.903 --> 01:34:45.449
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

01:34:45.783 --> 01:34:48.869
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

01:34:49.078 --> 01:34:51.539
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

01:34:51.747 --> 01:34:54.291
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.419
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:00.923
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:04.093
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.807
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

01:35:09.974 --> 01:35:11.016
Scabbers!

01:35:11.225 --> 01:35:14.311
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

01:35:36.792 --> 01:35:38.586
Remus?

01:35:39.378 --> 01:35:40.838
Sirius.

01:35:41.046 --> 01:35:42.923
My old friends!

01:35:48.596 --> 01:35:52.391
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.228
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

01:35:57.104 --> 01:35:59.690
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:05.112
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

01:36:05.321 --> 01:36:08.157
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

01:36:08.365 --> 01:36:10.951
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

01:36:11.368 --> 01:36:16.957
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

01:36:19.126 --> 01:36:21.504
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

01:36:21.712 --> 01:36:27.384
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

01:36:27.885 --> 01:36:32.014
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

01:36:32.264 --> 01:36:34.308
No!

01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:39.730
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

01:36:39.939 --> 01:36:41.816
But we'll take him to the castle.

01:36:42.024 --> 01:36:47.029
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

01:36:48.239 --> 01:36:50.616
I said we'd take you to the castle.

01:36:50.991 --> 01:36:53.202
After that,
the dementors can have you.

01:36:57.123 --> 01:37:00.876
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

01:37:01.043 --> 01:37:04.547
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

01:37:04.755 --> 01:37:06.298
I was going for the rat.

01:37:06.465 --> 01:37:10.302
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

01:37:10.469 --> 01:37:15.683
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:20.771
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:34.785
Okay.

01:37:39.832 --> 01:37:42.334
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

01:37:42.543 --> 01:37:43.919
It's fine. I'll stay.

01:37:44.712 --> 01:37:46.672
You go, I'll stay.

01:37:47.006 --> 01:37:50.092
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

01:37:51.719 --> 01:37:54.722
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

01:37:54.889 --> 01:37:57.433
They might chop it.

01:37:57.933 --> 01:38:00.603
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:04.982
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

01:38:06.233 --> 01:38:08.027
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:38:08.903 --> 01:38:12.615
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

01:38:13.365 --> 01:38:16.535
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

01:38:18.662 --> 01:38:21.499
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:24.418
He doesn't deserve it.

01:38:24.627 --> 01:38:27.797
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

01:38:27.963 --> 01:38:29.507
...to become killers.

01:38:29.673 --> 01:38:33.344
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

01:38:33.552 --> 01:38:35.888
Alive, you're free.

01:38:36.096 --> 01:38:39.183
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

01:38:39.391 --> 01:38:42.728
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

01:38:42.895 --> 01:38:45.356
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

01:38:45.564 --> 01:38:49.610
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

01:38:52.071 --> 01:38:53.948
I don't know if you know, Harry...

01:38:54.156 --> 01:38:58.202
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:00.371
I know.

01:39:01.539 --> 01:39:05.584
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

01:39:05.751 --> 01:39:08.212
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:10.881
What? Come and live with you?

01:39:12.216 --> 01:39:15.386
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

01:39:15.594 --> 01:39:17.138
Harry!

01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:36.198
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

01:39:37.575 --> 01:39:42.913
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

01:39:44.248 --> 01:39:46.208
This flesh is only flesh!

01:39:47.418 --> 01:39:49.462
Expelliarmus!

01:39:59.597 --> 01:40:01.140
Harry!

01:40:02.224 --> 01:40:05.144
Remus! Remus!

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.694
Run! Run!

01:40:23.746 --> 01:40:25.790
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

01:40:25.956 --> 01:40:31.003
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

01:40:31.212 --> 01:40:33.422
Professor?

01:40:37.551 --> 01:40:39.094
Professor Lupin?

01:40:46.852 --> 01:40:50.106
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

01:40:50.523 --> 01:40:53.025
There you are, Potter!

01:41:26.851 --> 01:41:27.852
Sirius!

01:41:28.727 --> 01:41:31.105
Come back here, Potter!

01:42:36.962 --> 01:42:38.339
Sirius!

01:42:39.173 --> 01:42:42.092
No. Sirius!

01:43:24.009 --> 01:43:26.846
Expecto Patronum!

01:45:39.687 --> 01:45:42.064
Harry?

01:45:42.982 --> 01:45:45.317
I saw my dad.

01:45:45.568 --> 01:45:47.111
What?

01:45:47.319 --> 01:45:48.863
He sent the dementors away.

01:45:49.029 --> 01:45:50.406
I saw him across the lake.

01:45:50.614 --> 01:45:52.241
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

01:45:52.491 --> 01:45:55.327
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

01:45:55.494 --> 01:45:57.955
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

01:45:58.205 --> 01:45:59.999
Much worse.

01:46:00.207 --> 01:46:02.585
They're going to suck out his soul.

01:46:04.295 --> 01:46:05.671
Headmaster, stop them.

01:46:05.838 --> 01:46:09.175
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

01:46:09.383 --> 01:46:11.594
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.137
He's my rat, sir.

01:46:13.554 --> 01:46:17.308
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

01:46:17.558 --> 01:46:21.187
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

01:46:21.437 --> 01:46:23.898
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

01:46:24.148 --> 01:46:29.570
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

01:46:32.656 --> 01:46:35.409
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

01:46:35.618 --> 01:46:39.371
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

01:46:44.585 --> 01:46:47.087
Mysterious thing, time.

01:46:48.297 --> 01:46:49.590
Powerful...

01:46:49.799 --> 01:46:52.635
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

01:46:54.261 --> 01:46:57.848
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

01:46:58.682 --> 01:47:00.810
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

01:47:00.976 --> 01:47:02.770
You must not be seen.

01:47:02.937 --> 01:47:06.565
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

01:47:06.774 --> 01:47:10.277
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

01:47:10.861 --> 01:47:12.655
If you succeed tonight...

01:47:12.822 --> 01:47:15.658
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

01:47:17.493 --> 01:47:19.703
Three turns should do it, I think.

01:47:24.583 --> 01:47:26.377
Oh, and by the way.

01:47:26.585 --> 01:47:32.424
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

01:47:32.591 --> 01:47:34.635
Good luck.

01:47:35.177 --> 01:47:37.596
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

01:47:38.305 --> 01:47:40.599
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

01:48:09.628 --> 01:48:11.255
What just happened?

01:48:11.422 --> 01:48:13.716
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

01:48:13.883 --> 01:48:15.759
Where were we at 7:30?

01:48:15.926 --> 01:48:17.720
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

01:48:17.887 --> 01:48:20.222
Come on. And we can't be seen.

01:48:21.348 --> 01:48:23.142
Hermione!

01:48:41.368 --> 01:48:44.038
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

01:48:45.831 --> 01:48:49.418
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

01:48:49.627 --> 01:48:52.463
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

01:48:52.630 --> 01:48:53.923
That's us.

01:48:54.173 --> 01:48:57.092
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

01:48:57.301 --> 01:48:58.761
This is not normal.

01:49:01.055 --> 01:49:03.432
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

01:49:03.599 --> 01:49:05.810
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

01:49:05.976 --> 01:49:09.313
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

01:49:09.522 --> 01:49:12.691
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:16.237
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

01:49:18.572 --> 01:49:21.742
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:26.163
Good punch.

01:49:26.372 --> 01:49:27.832
Thanks.

01:49:28.874 --> 01:49:30.501
Malfoy's coming.

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.754
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

01:49:34.255 --> 01:49:37.341
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

01:49:37.508 --> 01:49:41.387
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

01:49:42.805 --> 01:49:45.349
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

01:50:04.535 --> 01:50:07.037
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

01:50:08.539 --> 01:50:10.416
Of course.

01:50:10.583 --> 01:50:12.543
Remember what Dumbledore said?

01:50:12.751 --> 01:50:16.797
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

01:50:17.173 --> 01:50:18.466
Let's go.

01:50:39.779 --> 01:50:41.906
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

01:50:42.072 --> 01:50:44.533
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

01:50:44.742 --> 01:50:47.203
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

01:50:48.245 --> 01:50:50.623
Scabbers, you're alive!

01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:53.542
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

01:50:53.793 --> 01:50:56.712
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

01:50:56.879 --> 01:50:59.882
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:06.430
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

01:51:06.639 --> 01:51:09.475
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

01:51:09.642 --> 01:51:12.478
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

01:51:12.686 --> 01:51:14.897
We can't be seen.

01:51:18.234 --> 01:51:19.944
Fudge is coming.

01:51:20.861 --> 01:51:22.905
And we aren't leaving?

01:51:25.116 --> 01:51:26.659
Why aren't we leaving?

01:51:37.628 --> 01:51:39.171
Are you mad?

01:51:45.177 --> 01:51:46.554
That hurt.

01:51:46.762 --> 01:51:48.055
Sorry.

01:52:08.951 --> 01:52:11.620
We're coming out the back door. Go!

01:52:29.013 --> 01:52:31.849
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

01:52:33.893 --> 01:52:35.186
What?

01:52:36.103 --> 01:52:37.897
I thought I just saw...

01:52:38.147 --> 01:52:40.816
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

01:52:55.122 --> 01:52:57.416
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

01:53:03.672 --> 01:53:05.633
Get away. Get off.

01:53:27.822 --> 01:53:31.242
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

01:53:32.076 --> 01:53:35.246
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

01:53:35.454 --> 01:53:39.208
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

01:53:43.712 --> 01:53:46.382
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

01:53:48.801 --> 01:53:52.555
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

01:53:53.431 --> 01:53:56.684
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

01:53:57.101 --> 01:53:58.811
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

01:54:01.522 --> 01:54:04.442
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

01:54:04.692 --> 01:54:06.986
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

01:54:09.613 --> 01:54:14.076
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

01:54:14.326 --> 01:54:15.953
- Now, look there.
- Where?

01:54:16.203 --> 01:54:19.540
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

01:54:19.748 --> 01:54:23.252
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

01:54:23.419 --> 01:54:26.255
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

01:54:27.214 --> 01:54:30.050
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

01:54:30.259 --> 01:54:31.427
- Over there.
- Where?

01:54:31.594 --> 01:54:33.304
- Over there.
- This way.

01:54:33.554 --> 01:54:36.223
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

01:54:37.892 --> 01:54:39.602
But where is it?

01:54:40.519 --> 01:54:42.730
I saw the beast, just now.

01:54:43.355 --> 01:54:45.566
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

01:54:45.733 --> 01:54:47.026
Buckbeak.

01:54:47.276 --> 01:54:51.322
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:52.823
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

01:54:53.073 --> 01:54:57.286
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

01:54:57.536 --> 01:55:00.372
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

01:55:00.539 --> 01:55:02.416
- Right.
- Well, well.

01:55:02.583 --> 01:55:04.126
We must search the grounds.

01:55:04.293 --> 01:55:07.296
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

01:55:07.505 --> 01:55:12.927
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

01:55:13.094 --> 01:55:17.056
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

01:55:17.264 --> 01:55:19.141
Thank you.

01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:22.603
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

01:55:33.405 --> 01:55:34.865
- Come on.
- This way.

01:55:41.705 --> 01:55:43.499
This way, now.

01:55:45.918 --> 01:55:47.628
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

01:55:47.878 --> 01:55:50.339
- How?
- No idea.

01:55:59.682 --> 01:56:02.017
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

01:56:08.482 --> 01:56:10.443
And Snape's coming.

01:56:16.699 --> 01:56:18.325
And now we wait.

01:56:19.577 --> 01:56:21.370
And now we wait.

01:56:48.939 --> 01:56:52.193
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

01:56:54.987 --> 01:56:56.781
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

01:56:56.947 --> 01:57:01.243
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

01:57:01.452 --> 01:57:03.579
...I did see someone.

01:57:03.746 --> 01:57:07.166
That someone
made the dementors go away.

01:57:07.333 --> 01:57:08.626
With a Patronus.

01:57:08.834 --> 01:57:10.711
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.379
According to him...

01:57:12.546 --> 01:57:15.966
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

01:57:16.133 --> 01:57:18.010
It was my dad.

01:57:19.136 --> 01:57:20.930
My dad conjured the Patronus.

01:57:21.097 --> 01:57:23.307
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

01:57:24.767 --> 01:57:27.061
I'm just telling you what I saw.

01:57:31.232 --> 01:57:32.858
Here we come.

01:57:38.531 --> 01:57:40.866
You see Sirius talking to me there?

01:57:41.075 --> 01:57:43.911
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

01:57:44.078 --> 01:57:47.414
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

01:57:47.581 --> 01:57:49.208
It'll just be me and him.

01:57:49.875 --> 01:57:51.836
We could live in the country...

01:57:52.002 --> 01:57:54.588
...someplace you can see the sky.

01:57:54.797 --> 01:57:57.633
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

01:57:58.676 --> 01:58:00.219
Harry!

01:58:01.762 --> 01:58:03.472
Run!

01:58:10.354 --> 01:58:11.897
Let's go.

01:58:31.459 --> 01:58:33.752
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

01:58:38.048 --> 01:58:39.425
Thanks.

01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:45.306
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

02:00:00.422 --> 02:00:02.133
That was so scary.

02:00:02.341 --> 02:00:05.261
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:19.817
Sirius. Come on!

02:00:35.875 --> 02:00:38.002
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

02:00:38.169 --> 02:00:41.338
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

02:00:50.097 --> 02:00:51.891
Any minute now.

02:00:52.141 --> 02:00:54.185
Right there. You'll see.

02:00:55.561 --> 02:00:58.022
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

02:00:58.230 --> 02:01:00.733
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

02:01:04.904 --> 02:01:07.323
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

02:01:09.408 --> 02:01:11.285
...both of you.

02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:15.080
Harry!

02:01:16.999 --> 02:01:20.836
Expecto Patronum!

02:02:19.478 --> 02:02:21.021
You were right, Hermione.

02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:24.567
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

02:02:24.733 --> 02:02:27.486
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

02:02:27.653 --> 02:02:29.989
I knew I could do it
this time because...

02:02:30.197 --> 02:02:31.907
...well, I had already done it.

02:02:32.074 --> 02:02:34.493
- Does that make sense?
- No.

02:02:34.702 --> 02:02:37.538
But I don't like flying...!

02:02:50.676 --> 02:02:51.969
Bombarda!

02:03:25.336 --> 02:03:28.088
I'll be forever grateful for this...

02:03:28.297 --> 02:03:29.590
...to both of you.

02:03:29.799 --> 02:03:32.718
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

02:03:32.885 --> 02:03:35.805
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

02:03:35.971 --> 02:03:37.681
And besides...

02:03:38.641 --> 02:03:41.894
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

02:03:42.103 --> 02:03:44.230
And you know it.

02:03:45.314 --> 02:03:47.191
And for now, that will do.

02:03:49.527 --> 02:03:52.029
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

02:03:53.072 --> 02:03:55.574
...but you look so like your father.

02:03:57.368 --> 02:03:59.328
Except your eyes.

02:04:00.287 --> 02:04:02.581
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

02:04:04.542 --> 02:04:09.588
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

02:04:10.214 --> 02:04:11.674
But know this:

02:04:12.842 --> 02:04:16.011
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

02:04:17.388 --> 02:04:19.348
And you can always find them...

02:04:21.725 --> 02:04:23.602
...in here.

02:04:33.988 --> 02:04:36.490
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:04.977
We have to go.

02:05:33.255 --> 02:05:35.925
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

02:05:36.092 --> 02:05:37.635
Did what?

02:05:37.802 --> 02:05:39.762
Good night.

02:05:48.521 --> 02:05:49.814
How did you get there?

02:05:50.022 --> 02:05:52.691
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

02:05:53.025 --> 02:05:55.611
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:59.323
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:27.309
Hello, Harry.

02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:32.773
I saw you coming.

02:06:37.361 --> 02:06:40.030
I've looked worse, believe me.

02:06:42.783 --> 02:06:45.953
- You've been sacked.
- No.

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:49.039
No. I resigned, actually.

02:06:49.248 --> 02:06:51.041
Resigned? Why?

02:06:51.208 --> 02:06:56.464
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

02:06:56.672 --> 02:07:02.178
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

02:07:02.344 --> 02:07:05.681
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

02:07:05.931 --> 02:07:07.808
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

02:07:08.017 --> 02:07:09.894
...risked enough on my behalf.

02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:13.314
Besides, people like me are...

02:07:13.939 --> 02:07:17.276
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

02:07:26.827 --> 02:07:29.371
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.707
None of it made any difference.

02:07:31.916 --> 02:07:35.419
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

02:07:35.628 --> 02:07:39.131
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

02:07:39.298 --> 02:07:41.759
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

02:07:42.176 --> 02:07:44.637
It made a great deal of difference.

02:07:49.308 --> 02:07:51.519
If I am proud of anything...

02:07:51.685 --> 02:07:54.355
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

02:07:54.522 --> 02:07:57.274
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

02:07:57.441 --> 02:08:01.654
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

02:08:02.613 --> 02:08:05.074
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

02:08:05.282 --> 02:08:07.827
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:09.703
Until then...

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:12.790
...mischief managed.

02:08:47.032 --> 02:08:51.245
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

02:08:51.412 --> 02:08:52.788
Harry.

02:08:53.664 --> 02:08:55.040
Wherever did you get it?

02:08:55.207 --> 02:08:57.585
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

02:08:57.793 --> 02:08:59.920
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

02:09:00.129 --> 02:09:03.382
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

02:09:03.591 --> 02:09:06.051
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:07.720
Did not.

02:09:09.138 --> 02:09:12.641
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

02:09:12.808 --> 02:09:14.351
For me?

02:09:14.518 --> 02:09:17.021
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

02:09:17.229 --> 02:09:19.106
This came with it.

02:09:23.986 --> 02:09:25.613
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

02:09:25.821 --> 02:09:27.615
How fast is it, Harry?

02:09:47.009 --> 02:09:48.636
Lumos.

02:09:48.803 --> 02:09:51.180
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

02:21:10.401 --> 02:21:12.194
Mischief managed.

02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:19.410
Nox.
