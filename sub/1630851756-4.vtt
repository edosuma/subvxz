00:00.880 --> 00:03.000
<i>I wanted Ian Holloway</i>
<i>right from the start.</i>

00:03.800 --> 00:05.920
Ian Holloway bounds
in the door.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.280
<i>Completely different experience.</i>

00:09.080 --> 00:10.600
<i>Everything we hit was going in.</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:11.600
<i>What a run.</i>

00:11.680 --> 00:13.200
<i>Palace were top of the league.</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:14.560
It was quite surreal.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.120
<i>The best I've ever seen us play.</i>

00:17.200 --> 00:19.120
<i>Thirty goals for the season.</i>

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
<i>This is incredible!</i>

00:20.760 --> 00:23.680
<i>And they're in dreamland,</i>
<i>top of the championship.</i>

00:23.760 --> 00:25.600
This is why I like playing football.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.240
An incredible place
to play football

00:27.320 --> 00:29.920
The whole place just exploded.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And the pride of South London,
Crystal Palace!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.400
I loved him, man,
and he was hilarious.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.800
<i>One of the best managers</i>
<i>I played for.</i>

00:37.840 --> 00:39.040
<i>I don't think people realize</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:41.080
<i>how good some of these players</i>
<i>actually are.</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:43.760
Best moments of my career
were in that season.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.160
<i>He just caused mayhem.</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:48.600
Such a big difference
for our community.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.520
<i>I owe it to the club</i>
<i>to come back and finish this off.</i>

00:52.680 --> 00:53.760
Just too good for the division.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.160
We can do this.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.000
Who is gonna stop us?

00:57.120 --> 00:59.000
<i>When we started losing games...</i>

00:59.120 --> 01:01.320
They beat us
like it was a training drill.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.880
<i>Our confidence has been knocked.</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:04.440
<i>It's the worst day</i>
<i>of the whole season.</i>

01:04.560 --> 01:06.000
<i>It wasn't just a slump--</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:08.080
It was a long time
before we had another win.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.720
<i>Completely lost their way.</i>

01:10.840 --> 01:12.640
This has got to be our time, boys.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.760
<i>A big old-fashioned Palace horror show.</i>

01:15.880 --> 01:17.640
And if we're not careful here,
we're gonna blow it.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.960
<i>They are back from the brink.</i>

01:29.160 --> 01:30.760
<i>A club that they've loved since children.</i>

01:31.600 --> 01:33.360
<i>Wilfried Zaha!</i>

01:34.800 --> 01:37.440
<i>That is magical!</i>
<i>Simply Magical!</i>

01:37.560 --> 01:38.880
<i>Top of the championship!</i>

01:39.000 --> 01:41.360
<i>Cannot believe what</i>
<i>Crystal Palace have done.</i>

01:41.440 --> 01:43.520
<i>Back from the brink</i>
<i>of oblivion.</i>

01:43.640 --> 01:46.120
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage!</i>

01:46.240 --> 01:50.240
<i>That will always be etched</i>
<i>in Crystal Palace history.</i>

02:04.960 --> 02:08.040
<i>I think they had about</i>
<i>four chances and scored three,</i>

02:08.160 --> 02:09.400
<i>and one of them was Cresswell.</i>

02:09.440 --> 02:12.200
<i>He drilled it in from, like,</i>
<i>35 yards, you know, but...</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:16.720
Steve and I had a chat after that
and, you know, what's wrong with a draw?

02:16.840 --> 02:18.280
You know, 'cause I was trying to win it.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.320
When I first got the job,
I'm fed up with draws,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.920
I wanted someone
who goes to try and win and...

02:23.040 --> 02:24.640
It really looked
like it was slipping away.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.880
There were 4-0 and 3-0.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.400
<i>And then our confidence had gone,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

02:28.520 --> 02:30.800
<i>We just didn't believe really</i>
<i>in what we were doing.</i>

02:30.920 --> 02:32.200
<i>It's a big step for me</i>

02:32.320 --> 02:35.040
who had success with my new plan
of what I wanted to do.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.520
It never goes well in my opinion

02:37.560 --> 02:41.200
when chairmen start interfering
too much in the football.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.040
Who to play, who to pick,
how to play.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.440
<i>It's such a difficult job</i>
<i>being a football manager.</i>

02:46.560 --> 02:49.120
As it is, without having
so many voices in your ear

02:49.240 --> 02:51.280
that you can't do it the way
that you want to do it.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.160
<i>But, this moment, I couldn't let it go.</i>
<i>Something needs to be said.</i>

02:55.280 --> 02:57.560
<i>You talk about the relationship</i>
<i>between a chairman and a manager,</i>

02:57.680 --> 02:58.760
<i>there is tension sometimes,</i>

02:58.880 --> 03:01.240
<i>but it's functional tension</i>
<i>and that's what you want.</i>

03:01.320 --> 03:03.000
<i>People got to be able to say</i>
<i>what they think.</i>

03:03.120 --> 03:06.400
You have to look at how uncomfortable

03:06.520 --> 03:08.440
the lads were feeling, really.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.760
They didn't want Dougie to go.
They didn't want to change it.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.840
Ian and I had
a very functional relationship.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.200
He's a very easy person to talk to.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.640
So, I went the training ground,

03:16.760 --> 03:19.600
and of course, it was a slightly
difficult conversation.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.960
When you first arrived

03:21.040 --> 03:24.520
and you added what you do
on top of what we had,

03:24.640 --> 03:25.920
we were sensational.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.480
And I just think we've gone
a bit too far too quickly.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.280
We might not be successful,
which would be a real tragedy.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.080
Every fan thought it.
I knew the players thought it.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.560
I knew I was on really strong ground.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.280
And after quite some conversation,
to his eternal credit,

03:41.360 --> 03:45.440
Ian just turned around to me and said,
"Okay. You're right. I'll do it."

03:45.560 --> 03:49.840
And from that moment on, I have to say,
he was absolutely brilliant.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.600
So I had to be big enough
to come back in and say

03:52.680 --> 03:56.000
"Right, lads. Let's get back
to what you do well."

03:56.040 --> 03:58.920
I remember going out
to sort of start training

03:59.040 --> 04:01.680
when I'm waiting and looking at the watch
and no one out there

04:01.760 --> 04:03.760
and it works out that
they were having a meeting

04:03.880 --> 04:06.640
between themselves
about where they wanted to go

04:06.680 --> 04:09.680
with the team to continue on this run
and get into the playoffs.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.320
<i>I think we had four games,</i>
<i>and I said to Ian,</i>

04:11.400 --> 04:13.760
<i>"Look, if we draw these four games,</i>
<i>we'll get in the playoffs."</i>

04:13.880 --> 04:15.040
<i>If we get in the playoffs,</i>
<i>you know we've got</i>

04:15.160 --> 04:16.520
<i>a very good team and we've got a chance.</i>

04:16.560 --> 04:18.440
<i>This isn't about me,</i>
<i>this is about Palace.</i>

04:18.560 --> 04:20.240
<i>This is about</i>
<i>what you've been building</i>.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.080
<i>So let's go right back, start again.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

04:23.200 --> 04:24.880
It was a bit of a...

04:25.360 --> 04:27.960
...a nervous time
and the playoffs had looked pretty likely

04:28.040 --> 04:29.840
and suddenly,
were looking a bit unlikely.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.560
<i>I still did little bits</i>
<i>of my training,</i>

04:40.680 --> 04:44.080
<i>but I adopted the way</i>
<i>they used to do things.</i>

04:51.360 --> 04:54.200
<i>With a twist</i>
<i>of my personality.</i>

05:03.040 --> 05:05.240
<i>And let's move forward</i>
<i>and I believe we'll be good at it.</i>

05:05.280 --> 05:07.120
<i>My bits and pieces got shelved.</i>

05:08.880 --> 05:09.960
<i>We drew the next three games</i>

05:10.080 --> 05:11.520
and then, obviously,
going into the last game

05:11.640 --> 05:13.080
of the season against Peterborough,

05:13.120 --> 05:16.080
we needed to draw at least
to get into the playoffs.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.720
<i>But that whole final day</i>
<i>for the championship</i>

05:24.760 --> 05:27.120
was one of the most exciting final days

05:27.200 --> 05:29.440
ever in football in my lifetime.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.200
<i>Incredible stories up and down</i>
<i>the division.</i>

05:32.240 --> 05:34.440
<i>I do not want to be</i>
<i>in the playoffs with Bolton</i>

05:34.560 --> 05:36.920
<i>The nightmare if Bolton had</i>
<i>gone up and we hadn't gone up.</i>

05:37.040 --> 05:38.920
<i>I mean that would have</i>
<i>just been unthinkable.</i>

05:39.040 --> 05:42.520
Peterborough had to come here
and just needed a point.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.840
<i>We're all pretty nervous</i>

05:43.880 --> 05:46.040
<i>and, you know, there were</i>
<i>all these permutations</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:48.480
<i>that if Bolton won and Forest won</i>

05:48.520 --> 05:50.880
<i>or Leicester won or we lost and...</i>

05:50.920 --> 05:52.000
Anything can happen.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.400
If we'd lost

05:53.920 --> 05:55.240
and depending on other results,

05:55.360 --> 05:57.320
we may well have dropped
out of the playoff place.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.360
Where's your Corvette, madam?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.600
It's my...

06:08.640 --> 06:10.040
What are you waiting for?

06:10.440 --> 06:13.080
<i>Some people have been here,</i>
<i>like, 20-30 years.</i>

06:13.200 --> 06:16.040
They've hung in, sort of,
through the ups and the lows

06:16.080 --> 06:17.840
and then sort of be here for,
you know,

06:17.880 --> 06:20.240
what will be just
an amazing season,

06:20.280 --> 06:21.520
not just for the team,

06:21.640 --> 06:23.680
but obviously for the people
that work here as well.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.400
<i>The atmosphere is so tense.</i>

06:25.520 --> 06:27.360
Hopefully, going up
to the Premier League.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.200
It's tense.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.160
I would be very disappointed
if we don't get into the playoffs.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.320
We've, we've been out there
all the time.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.360
So much of negativity recently.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.280
You know, you go online,
the online message boards

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
or Twitter or anything like that
and you wish you hadn't.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.320
<i>Meltdown seems to be the buzzword.</i>
<i>Everyone's gone into meltdown really.</i>

06:43.440 --> 06:46.240
Ian has a parable
and a metaphor every week.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.480
that he builds his week around

06:47.600 --> 06:49.840
and you'll hear the story
20 times that week.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.840
In fact, you have a speech
of the one he made in Speroni's.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

06:54.320 --> 06:56.320
Manager of Crystal Palace,
Mr. Ian Holloway.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.560
Good afternoon. How are ya?

07:02.760 --> 07:04.560
How are we hanging up? Alright?
Everybody, okay?

07:04.600 --> 07:05.960
-You nervous, son?
-Yep.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.560
He's nervous.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.200
Anybody who went to Millwall?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.680
What a place that is, isn't it?

07:13.800 --> 07:16.320
Even the horses look scared,
I must admit.

07:16.440 --> 07:21.000
The plan of it is we've got to stop
their midfield players getting it

07:21.080 --> 07:23.160
and if we can out power them
and out-dominate them

07:23.280 --> 07:24.440
in that midfield area,

07:24.480 --> 07:27.960
I think our wide men
will hurt their back four.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.320
Okay?

07:29.480 --> 07:30.520
Okay?

07:30.880 --> 07:33.760
You didn't look like you got it.
Yes. Put that red wine down.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.640
It's times like this you live for.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.040
Whatever you thought we might get,

07:38.160 --> 07:40.040
whatever you hoped we might get,

07:40.160 --> 07:43.160
if we haven't got that for you,
don't stop believing in 'em.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.880
Now it feels like, to be honest,

07:45.000 --> 07:46.880
someone's died over
the last six weeks, doesn't it?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.400
Not being funny. It's awful.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.520
But what you have to do
is keep believing

07:51.640 --> 07:53.120
in yourself and in each other.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.160
Now I think that's gradually
coming back with these boys.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.760
They didn't ask for any change.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.240
They want to keep going.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.160
If we'd changed earlier,
I might have got you three wins

08:03.280 --> 08:04.800
the first three games of the season

08:04.920 --> 08:07.360
and we might be now going
for second place

08:07.400 --> 08:10.120
because some of you think that
Dougie might've already got you up.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.160
Well, that's unfair unless
you balance it out correctly.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.000
Is that not right?

08:15.080 --> 08:17.200
Add nine points to what
we've already done.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.480
Don't you start blaming me.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.040
I'm going to be here for a long time.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.320
Okay?

08:22.440 --> 08:26.400
Now, I'm being honest with you,
these boys probably want it too much.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.200
Some of them
have already talked about it,

08:28.280 --> 08:30.760
and I shared
a little thing with them

08:30.880 --> 08:34.720
about my dad when he died
25 years ago, only 50 years old.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.960
Cut a long story short.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.200
We had a massive row,
and he said don't ever ask for one.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.600
You have to ask for my opinion,
I'll never give it.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.440
So I had the worst game I've ever had,
felt absolutely diabolical at Brentford.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.800
So I said to him, "Mortal mistake,
what do you think?"

08:50.200 --> 08:51.880
And he said, and I quote,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.080
"I think you should retire,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.840
I think you should come back to Bath.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.200
I think it's all too much.
You didn't look good enough today."

08:59.240 --> 09:01.760
And that was the first time
he ever said that to me.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.680
Right? Two months later, he died.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.760
Absolutely killed me.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.880
Because I thought he didn't believe in me.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.800
And then I remembered

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
something he told me
when I was nine

09:15.320 --> 09:17.720
and I grabbed that, stuck that to my chest

09:17.760 --> 09:20.240
and every time I played,
I went out and played like that.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.160
He said, "If you don't make it, son,
let it be through lack of ability

09:24.200 --> 09:25.960
rather than lack of effort."

09:27.000 --> 09:29.680
Now, that took me
to the Premier League,

09:29.800 --> 09:32.040
as a player, when I was 29.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.840
It all was going to be too late.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.560
As a manager, because
I carry that in my heart.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.560
All I've asked my boys to do today

09:38.680 --> 09:39.760
is go out there,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.360
I don't know how good they are yet,
they haven't proved it,

09:42.480 --> 09:44.280
but I believe in them even now,

09:44.320 --> 09:46.160
even after not winning
for nine games.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.200
<i>That don't make them bad players,</i>

09:48.320 --> 09:50.400
<i>that don't make them not good enough.</i>

09:50.520 --> 09:52.640
<i>What we need to do now is believe</i>

09:52.760 --> 09:54.560
<i>in each other and in ourselves</i>

09:54.640 --> 09:57.200
<i>and go out there</i>
<i>and try as hard as we can.</i>

09:57.280 --> 09:59.200
<i>And we gotta want it</i>
<i>more than Peterborough.</i>

09:59.400 --> 10:00.960
<i>And if you stop believing in that,</i>

10:01.040 --> 10:03.520
and this team aren't
good enough to do that,

10:03.640 --> 10:05.880
then I don't want you here

10:06.000 --> 10:08.760
because your negativity
might go to them.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.960
Do you understand?

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
And what happens is people start

10:12.680 --> 10:15.040
trying to work out who we should be.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.600
You can't do it.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.200
Not this year, not in this league.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.280
You can't do it.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.640
What you got to do
is get the points that matter.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.320
Now we can't be second.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.320
Right? We can't.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.160
But we can be in them playoffs

10:29.200 --> 10:30.680
and I've been there before.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.400
And I know how they work.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.200
So just be patient,
get behind your team today,

10:35.240 --> 10:37.120
make sure you love them, whatever.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.720
One fan out there said to me

10:38.840 --> 10:42.840
"Ollie, just make sure you tell them
how proud we are of them anyway."

10:43.680 --> 10:46.640
And that's what we should be. Okay?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.040
That's what we're gonna be

10:48.120 --> 10:50.680
and I need you to help them
over this line.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.560
Once we're over the line,
nothing else matters.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.640
We're in there with the chance
and we'll be as good as anybody else.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.240
We need this today

10:58.360 --> 10:59.640
because the last six weeks

10:59.760 --> 11:01.880
have been an absolute
living nightmare.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.160
No one's died. Get on with it.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.560
We lost a few games,

11:05.600 --> 11:07.560
we didn't win when people
thought we should.

11:07.640 --> 11:11.280
Let's get on with it and do it now
'cause we carry your hopes and dreams

11:11.400 --> 11:14.200
in the palm of our hand,
and more importantly, in our legs.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.120
And we're gonna go out there
today and we're gonna run,

11:16.240 --> 11:17.640
and we're going to chase
and we're going to run

11:17.680 --> 11:19.560
as if our heart is gonna burst.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.240
Now if that ain't good enough,

11:21.320 --> 11:22.720
I don't know what else is.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.320
Okay?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.520
On the bench...

11:26.120 --> 11:27.280
Alright, son?

11:27.360 --> 11:28.640
He's a bit worried now.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.440
Thank you very much.
Enjoy the day.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Ian Holloway. Come on!

11:39.160 --> 11:42.240
Probably the most nervous we'd been
certainly since I'd been there.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.080
So the game was huge pressure.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.720
Peterborough were obviously
fighting for to stay up.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.680
So there's huge importance
on the game.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.360
But we were desperate for a win,
I didn't think...

11:50.480 --> 11:52.360
We hadn't won in eight
or nine or something,

11:52.480 --> 11:53.680
we'd had a lot of draws.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.120
We were hopeful we're gonna
make the playoffs in that game.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.400
I think we'd took that position
at the start of the season.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.640
There's always nerves, but you just
go out there and do what you can, really.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.840
A big built up day, wasn't it?

12:04.960 --> 12:08.880
A bit of tension around
and I just remember thinking to myself,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.680
they're gonna have everything
to play for here.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.840
Like, we can't have
our guard down against these.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.320
Today's the day.
Everything that you've done,

12:16.440 --> 12:19.480
together for the last,
God knows how long,

12:19.600 --> 12:20.920
I want it today.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.160
If we have to hit Muzz,
just get something on it.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.760
We need to be strong.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.680
<i>No mistakes.</i>

12:26.720 --> 12:29.520
<i>Our strength today</i>
<i>will be to out power them,</i>

12:31.120 --> 12:34.400
<i>outwork them, outfight,</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:36.400
<i>and then everything starts again.</i>

12:36.520 --> 12:37.840
<i>And we'll be over this period.</i>

12:37.960 --> 12:40.040
<i>I tell you, it makes you stronger.</i>

12:40.160 --> 12:42.840
<i>If you can keep doing</i>
<i>what you need to keep doing</i>

12:42.960 --> 12:44.760
<i>and still believe in yourselves,</i>

12:44.800 --> 12:46.640
<i>you'll get stronger and stronger.</i>

12:46.760 --> 12:48.600
<i>God help anyone else we'll meet.</i>

12:48.640 --> 12:51.800
<i>All right? Let's do this job</i>
<i>one step at a time.</i>

12:52.240 --> 12:54.200
<i>Defending is just recovering.</i>

12:54.280 --> 12:56.760
<i>And I haven't had ever</i>
<i>a better team at doing it.</i>

12:56.880 --> 12:58.920
<i>Remember if they have had an attack,</i>

12:59.040 --> 13:00.840
<i>we got to attack them quickly...</i>

13:01.720 --> 13:02.800
<i>with that energy,</i>

13:02.920 --> 13:05.160
<i>and what we showed</i>
<i>the other day was,</i>

13:05.280 --> 13:08.120
<i>no one's got bigger</i>
<i>or stronger energy than us.</i>

13:08.160 --> 13:10.520
<i>Millwall had a go, but we were terrific.</i>

13:11.320 --> 13:13.760
<i>Do that again today</i>
<i>and that'll be too much for them.</i>

13:13.800 --> 13:15.160
<i>Okay? Let's go.</i>

13:23.120 --> 13:26.680
<i>Well, after months of toil</i>
<i>and managerial departures</i>

13:26.800 --> 13:27.720
<i>and ups and downs,</i>

13:27.840 --> 13:30.360
<i>it all boils down to two simple rules</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

13:30.480 --> 13:33.280
<i>If Crystal Palace win,</i>
<i>they will be in the playoffs.</i>

13:33.360 --> 13:36.600
<i>If Peterborough win,</i>
<i>they will stay up in the championship.</i>

13:36.720 --> 13:39.400
<i>It's a proper blockbuster</i>
<i>end of season day</i>

13:39.520 --> 13:41.200
<i>with absolutely everything at stake.</i>

13:42.240 --> 13:45.560
<i>I reckon the Peterborough</i>
<i>game was crucial</i>

13:45.600 --> 13:48.680
<i>to the spirit of the club,</i>
<i>the energy,</i>

13:48.800 --> 13:51.280
<i>and how we looked</i>
<i>at going forward.</i>

13:51.400 --> 13:53.480
<i>It was a very tense game.</i>

13:53.600 --> 13:55.320
<i>They gave us a right old game.</i>

13:56.240 --> 13:57.680
<i>It's Bolasie.</i>

13:57.800 --> 13:59.880
<i>That's an awkward cross,</i>
<i>Delaney maybe,</i>

14:00.000 --> 14:01.720
<i>and Murray maybe.</i>

14:01.840 --> 14:03.720
<i>It's cleared off the line by McCann.</i>

14:03.840 --> 14:06.040
<i>To the neutral it was probably</i>
<i>quite an entertaining game.</i>

14:06.080 --> 14:08.520
<i>It wasn't entertaining for me at all.</i>

14:08.880 --> 14:10.680
I just wanted it to be over.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.760
<i>It's a day for strong nerves everywhere.</i>

14:19.920 --> 14:22.480
<i>Tomlin turns away from Ward,</i>
<i>being pursued by Bolasie.</i>

14:22.600 --> 14:24.680
<i>Brilliant skills from Tomlin,</i>
<i>he's onto the edge of the D.</i>

14:24.800 --> 14:27.800
<i>He's taking the ball on.</i>
<i>Oh, my word!</i>

14:27.840 --> 14:29.880
<i>It's one of the goals of the season.</i>

14:30.000 --> 14:33.600
<i>Lee Tomlin, an absolutely</i>
<i>astounding goal.</i>

14:33.640 --> 14:36.160
<i>He ran 40 yards and made four defenders.</i>

14:36.280 --> 14:38.520
Lee scored the first goal,
Lee Tomlin.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.920
And then it was just like,
"Oh wow. No way."

14:41.960 --> 14:43.720
That was a worry.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.800
When he waltzed in
from the left wing

14:45.920 --> 14:47.400
and banged one past Jules.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.840
Oh, no, I can't stand this.
If we miss out on this today...

14:51.760 --> 14:53.560
<i>Some concern on that Palace bench.</i>

14:54.400 --> 14:56.680
<i>And this cross from Mendez-Laing</i>
<i>eludes everybody.</i>

14:56.800 --> 14:58.280
<i>How's that not gone in?</i>

14:58.400 --> 15:00.560
I think that game was
our character

15:00.640 --> 15:02.320
and our season summed up in one.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.640
<i>Not long to go.</i>

15:06.000 --> 15:08.080
<i>Zakuani has caught Gabbidon there.</i>

15:10.480 --> 15:12.080
<i>It's a penalty.</i>

15:12.640 --> 15:15.120
Come on! Come on!

15:16.280 --> 15:17.720
Come on!

15:20.480 --> 15:21.960
<i>Here comes Glenn Murray then,</i>

15:22.000 --> 15:25.720
<i>referee blows his whistle,</i>
<i>right-footed. Into the top corner!</i>

15:25.760 --> 15:28.360
<i>And Crystal Palace are back</i>
<i>on level terms.</i>

15:28.400 --> 15:31.080
<i>As things stand, that could be sending</i>

15:31.200 --> 15:33.360
<i>Peterborough down</i>
<i>and out of the championship.</i>

15:33.400 --> 15:36.240
<i>And the Eagles will be flying</i>
<i>into the play-offs.</i>

15:36.320 --> 15:40.280
<i>It's Crystal Palace one,</i>
<i>Peterborough United one.</i>

15:47.920 --> 15:50.720
It's 1-1. Just got a penalty
to make it level.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.360
So, fingers crossed.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.440
Well, it's a really important
15 minutes now.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.600
Whatever the managers
both say in there,

15:57.720 --> 15:59.160
it's going to count, isn't it?

15:59.200 --> 16:02.880
So hopefully, Ian's will be
more inspirational than Darren Ferguson's.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.600
<i>If we were to go on and win this</i>
<i>three or 4-1 today,</i>

16:05.680 --> 16:07.760
everyone will all of a sudden feel
really confident going into the playoffs.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.040
<i>If we draw or if we kind of limp</i>
<i>into the playoffs</i>

16:10.080 --> 16:11.640
<i>like it kind of feels like we're</i>
<i>doing a bit at the moment,</i>

16:11.720 --> 16:14.880
then you're gonna get people

16:15.000 --> 16:16.440
just getting down about it.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.240
<i>So get behind your team</i>

16:18.280 --> 16:20.440
<i>and make some noise</i>
<i>for Ollie's boys.</i>

16:20.480 --> 16:23.520
Come on, you Palace!

16:24.680 --> 16:25.920
<i>Here's Wilfried Zaha,</i>

16:28.360 --> 16:30.640
<i>goes away from two and crosses low.</i>

16:30.760 --> 16:32.560
<i>What about Murray?</i>

16:34.400 --> 16:37.440
That final pass or the final shot,
just like you saw then.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.680
Off the line.
It's just not come off us.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.640
And that's been our luck
in the last few games.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.520
<i>Mendez-Laing, right-hand side</i>

16:45.640 --> 16:49.880
<i>bursts in between Moxey and Jedinak,</i>
<i>goes for a curler! Oh, he scores!</i>

16:49.960 --> 16:53.680
<i>And Peterborough leads again</i>
<i>in this remarkable game!</i>

16:56.120 --> 16:57.920
<i>Down, down, down, slow start.</i>

16:58.720 --> 17:01.120
Back, slow start, down again.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.120
<i>Here's Zaha, who crosses,</i>

17:15.240 --> 17:17.600
<i>and it's over the top</i>
<i>from Murray.</i>

17:19.800 --> 17:22.040
Fucking hell!

17:22.080 --> 17:23.160
<i>Goodness me.</i>

17:23.280 --> 17:24.560
<i>Time's running out.</i>

17:38.160 --> 17:41.320
<i>Phillips turns. Shoots.</i>
<i>Oh, he's found the corner.</i>

17:41.400 --> 17:45.400
And Kevin Phillips has pulled
things back for Crystal Palace.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.960
Come on!

17:48.440 --> 17:50.040
Come on!

17:50.840 --> 17:53.040
Come on!

17:57.280 --> 18:00.240
Kev scores finally and,
and everyone's through the roof.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.440
Wasn't even facing the goal

18:01.520 --> 18:02.920
and I've turned around
and it's in the top corner.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.880
Honestly, I don't know
how he scored.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.120
We get the 2-2
and it just erupts.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.360
Get in there!

18:09.720 --> 18:11.040
Come on!

18:11.160 --> 18:13.160
I feel like you make your luck.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.240
We worked so hard to get there

18:15.360 --> 18:17.480
and the team had character
and the heart.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.800
<i>It's not enough luck.</i>
<i>We needed to go again. Like, just try.</i>

18:24.480 --> 18:26.640
<i>In comes the free kick,</i>
<i>curled in towards the backpost,</i>

18:26.680 --> 18:29.280
<i>up goes the head... Jedinak!</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:42.240
<i>High drama at Selhurst Park.</i>

18:42.360 --> 18:45.760
<i>It's Crystal Palace, 3,</i>
<i>Peterborough, 2.</i>

18:47.840 --> 18:49.800
<i>The referee blows his whistle.</i>

18:50.040 --> 18:52.840
<i>and Crystal Palace</i>
<i>have snuck into the playoffs.</i>

18:52.960 --> 18:56.640
<i>Peterborough relegated.</i>
<i>What an extraordinary afternoon.</i>

19:11.520 --> 19:12.880
Feel gutted for them.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.960
<i>Seeing Peterborough get relegated</i>
<i>by that goal was a shame really.</i>

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
It wasn't nice.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.600
I guess we had tunnel vision
at that point,

19:21.640 --> 19:24.200
we had one goal,
and that's to get promoted.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.440
<i>We were just</i>
<i>so busy celebrating,</i>

19:30.480 --> 19:32.520
<i>we didn't realize</i>
<i>it relegated Peterborough.</i>

19:32.640 --> 19:34.000
So it was a bittersweet feeling
on that day

19:34.080 --> 19:37.160
because they're a great club
and it's awful being relegated.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.320
I don't mind who we play.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.160
I think we're a good enough team
to play anyone.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.560
And I think we can definitely
get to the play-off.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.720
Everything we've worked for,
now we have the opportunity.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.520
To do it the way we did
shows great character,

19:50.560 --> 19:51.840
it's what we've showed all year.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.480
And you know, to turn our fortunes around
with the last game to get a win

19:55.600 --> 19:59.400
and for it being enough to seal
the playoff spot is fantastic.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.960
Onwards from here.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.480
Obviously, we still need to tighten up
because it's not acceptable.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.320
A win going in is, is a bit more positive

20:06.440 --> 20:08.240
than on the back of five draws.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.360
We managed to get
the job done eventually.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.280
A huge sigh of relief on our part.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.040
We'd actually finally made it
and we'd secured that spot,

20:15.120 --> 20:17.720
and I don't know if we knew that
who we were gonna play in the next game

20:17.760 --> 20:20.000
but you know, it turned out to be

20:20.120 --> 20:22.120
probably, the two biggest games
of the season coming up.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.320
<i>It's about the team</i>
<i>that keeps their nerve,</i>

20:26.360 --> 20:27.720
<i>that produces on the day.</i>

20:27.800 --> 20:29.880
<i>We've got a lot of experience</i>
<i>in this squad</i>

20:30.000 --> 20:31.480
that have experienced
these games before.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.200
It was a relief at the end of that game

20:33.280 --> 20:34.640
because we're in the playoffs,
and then of course,

20:34.680 --> 20:37.320
we knew who we were gonna
be playing, our arch rivals.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.920
So it made it even more special.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.520
Just looking at that.
We got Brighton.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.080
It's gonna be big.
It's gonna be a big day.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.680
Probably a little bit sick,

20:44.760 --> 20:46.560
but it was an opportunity

20:46.680 --> 20:48.400
to knock my former club out,

20:48.520 --> 20:50.520
like, what more motivation
did I need?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.080
That sums me up,
to be honest with you.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.520
As you can see,
I don't remember a lot.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.120
I don't even remember going...
Jesus! We're in the playoffs.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.840
My starting point, was always, the day
I walked through the door of Palace,

21:15.880 --> 21:18.080
and anything after that
was a bonus for me.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.360
<i>That win gave us the confidence</i>
<i>to say "Bring it on."</i>

21:23.480 --> 21:25.600
We've beaten most teams
this season.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.720
Yeah, we've been on a bad run,
but who should we genuinely be scared of?

21:29.760 --> 21:33.760
I think the win was important because
we'd almost forgotten how that felt.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.920
And I think that gave us a platform.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.960
You know, that gave the players
that belief again

21:37.000 --> 21:40.960
that we were hard to score against
and we got back to a way of playing

21:41.040 --> 21:42.840
that was functional and it worked.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.040
We, obviously, needed to win the game

21:44.080 --> 21:45.920
because we didn't know
what was happening elsewhere.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.560
But when it turned out
we didn't need to win the game,

21:48.680 --> 21:50.160
I almost felt sorry
for Peterborough

21:50.280 --> 21:52.960
because they, you know,
they almost

21:53.080 --> 21:55.200
didn't deserve
to go down this season, I think.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.800
I understand the frustration
for their fans

21:56.920 --> 21:58.600
because normally, it's the sort
of thing that happens to us,

21:58.720 --> 22:00.360
they went down with a points total.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.760
That would have seen them probably
comfortably mid-table in any other season.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.320
We only won four more games
than Peterborough all season.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.480
<i>Hopefully that will breed</i>
<i>a little bit of confidence</i>

22:10.600 --> 22:13.680
because I think we lost
that confidence at the Amex.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.520
So it'd be nice to see
if we can go back there

22:15.640 --> 22:16.840
and return the favour to them.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.440
Come on!

22:19.440 --> 22:20.520
<i>We were gonna go up regardless.</i>

22:20.640 --> 22:22.240
<i>Play-offs' always the way.</i>

22:22.280 --> 22:23.760
It's the Palace way.
Make it hard for yourself.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.840
-It's never easy.
-Make it hard. Love it.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.280
<i>Ian's saying to me,</i>
<i>"Don't worry about the first leg.</i>

22:47.400 --> 22:49.120
<i>All we need to do</i>
<i>in the first leg is not lose it.</i>

22:49.240 --> 22:51.120
<i>We just don't want</i>
<i>to get beaten badly."</i>

22:51.240 --> 22:53.040
By the time we get
to their place, it's the cup final.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.680
The location doesn't matter.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.920
And ending up in the playoffs,

22:57.040 --> 22:58.920
<i>I was the perfect man</i>
<i>for the job.</i>

23:16.200 --> 23:18.200
<i>We had a little bit</i>
<i>of a reflection on the weekend.</i>

23:18.280 --> 23:19.560
Obviously, we are excited,

23:19.640 --> 23:22.280
but it's how we control our emotions

23:22.400 --> 23:25.040
<i>and you know,</i>
<i>we'll be doing that, definitely.</i>

23:25.800 --> 23:27.120
To be honest,
I don't think there is

23:27.240 --> 23:29.280
such thing as momentum really
going into the playoffs.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.160
In my almost 10 years here,

23:31.280 --> 23:35.040
I couldn't, you know, say anything bad
about the club really.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.000
We've been through good times
and bad times

23:37.120 --> 23:38.880
but I always enjoy my time here.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.480
My time at Palace has been great,
you know.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.840
Obviously, when I first joined,
we were bottom of the league,

23:44.960 --> 23:46.400
<i>and now fifth in the league.</i>

23:46.520 --> 23:48.320
<i>It's been a great season, personally.</i>

23:49.200 --> 23:50.640
Club's on an upward curve

23:50.760 --> 23:54.640
and being in the playoffs is great
and we just got to cherish these moments.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.920
There was a time when there wasn't
even gonna be a Palace.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.520
So I've been with Palace
through the hard times and the good times.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.080
So seeing Palace get promoted
will be the best thing.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.840
<i>So my daughter,</i>
<i>her and her boyfriend</i>

24:05.920 --> 24:07.920
<i>baked us a playoff cake</i>

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and it was totally iced
with an eagle on the top.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.680
<i>That proves to me that my family's</i>
<i>completely totally behind me</i>

24:13.760 --> 24:15.560
and I must admit, I shed a tear

24:15.640 --> 24:19.080
because I want to do something
for this football club

24:19.160 --> 24:22.600
because of what it means to me
and the sacrifice I've made.

24:22.680 --> 24:26.920
And I wanna prove to you people
that I'm worth me weight in gold.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.320
Hopefully, I can do that.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.040
<i>It's a wonderful game, the way</i>
<i>it brings communities together</i>

24:43.120 --> 24:45.560
<i>and gives people pride</i>
<i>in where they come from.</i>

24:45.640 --> 24:48.000
The fact there's a Starbucks
and a McDonald's on every street

24:48.080 --> 24:50.120
and every shopping centre looks the same.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.080
<i>It keeps communities</i>
<i>having something proud of</i>

24:53.160 --> 24:54.720
<i>of where they are</i>
<i>and where they're from.</i>

24:58.320 --> 25:01.120
Eagles!

25:02.240 --> 25:04.360
<i>Before we knew exactly who we were</i>
<i>going to play in the playoffs,</i>

25:04.440 --> 25:06.520
<i>I'd met Gus previously</i>
<i>in a restaurant</i>

25:06.600 --> 25:10.800
<i>and Gus had said to me that I hope</i>
<i>it's not you because it will be a circus.</i>

25:23.960 --> 25:27.440
The rivalry between the two clubs,
of course, the fans, always let you know,

25:27.520 --> 25:30.000
you know, how they feel about those games.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.840
<i>Having that opportunity to make history</i>
<i>and be a part of a group</i>

25:35.920 --> 25:38.080
<i>that has achieved something</i>
<i>that a lot of people</i>

25:38.160 --> 25:40.360
<i>wouldn't have given us</i>
<i>a hope to do.</i>

25:40.440 --> 25:43.400
<i>So everyone had that fire in their belly</i>

25:43.480 --> 25:46.480
to make sure that we were
gonna come out on top.

25:49.920 --> 25:53.280
I didn't even know it was a rivalry.
Obviously, I know about the history now.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.520
The old enemy.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.480
...produce two performances
of our lives.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.840
And I'd love to do it for you.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.240
But we've got a big task ahead of us,
so stick with us.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.800
Thank you ever so much indeed.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.200
Ollie was massive.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.800
That experience that he'd had
with Blackpool. He's brilliant.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.520
He just took all the pressure
off us and put it all on him

26:15.600 --> 26:17.760
<i>and then he came into his own.</i>

26:19.280 --> 26:22.840
<i>Emotions. You don't get any,</i>
<i>in that run just before this,</i>

26:22.920 --> 26:25.600
<i>we got a bit emotional,</i>
<i>and we don't do that here.</i>

26:25.680 --> 26:29.200
<i>We go out there and we give</i>
<i>every fucking thing together,</i>

26:29.280 --> 26:32.320
<i>just stay calm</i>
<i>and just be determined.</i>

26:32.400 --> 26:34.520
<i>The team that enjoys it the most,</i>
<i>the team that's brave,</i>

26:34.600 --> 26:37.040
<i>the team that really wants it the most,</i>
<i>fucking wins it.</i>

26:37.120 --> 26:39.320
<i>We've come through some fucking hell</i>

26:39.400 --> 26:42.680
<i>over the last six weeks</i>
<i>and I'm delighted we have.</i>

26:42.760 --> 26:45.280
<i>We know what that feels like,</i>
<i>they haven't.</i>

26:45.360 --> 26:47.840
<i>Right, they think they're 'it'</i>
<i>and we're gonna fucking show them.</i>

26:47.920 --> 26:51.800
<i>All you gotta do is run</i>
<i>and try harder than them</i>

26:51.880 --> 26:53.800
<i>for 180 fucking minutes.</i>

26:53.880 --> 26:56.440
<i>And I know</i>
<i>that's our biggest strength.</i>

26:56.520 --> 26:57.600
<i>Let's go.</i>

26:59.080 --> 27:02.480
<i>Well, I think we're all fascinated</i>
<i>to see what happens when you combine</i>

27:02.560 --> 27:05.400
<i>the intensity of a championship</i>
<i>playoff game</i>

27:05.480 --> 27:10.040
<i>with the depth of feeling</i>
<i>of a fiercely contested derby.</i>

27:10.120 --> 27:13.440
We were the underdogs really.
The odds were against us massively.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.920
Everyone had written us off at that point

27:15.000 --> 27:16.720
'cause of how Brighton
were playing football.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.440
Which perhaps played into our hands a bit
'cause I think Palace

27:19.520 --> 27:21.040
have always liked being the underdog.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.240
The atmosphere in the first game
was electric.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.040
<i>Their season at stake</i>

27:28.120 --> 27:31.040
<i>under the evening lights in South London</i>

27:31.120 --> 27:32.920
<i>on a Friday night.</i>

27:33.000 --> 27:34.680
<i>There's a genuine dislike</i>

27:34.760 --> 27:38.280
<i>that can be traced back</i>
<i>to the 1970s.</i>

27:42.360 --> 27:44.360
We knew we had a big, big opportunity.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.280
<i>Ulloa is off side.</i>

27:48.360 --> 27:49.840
<i>Getting it in.</i>

27:49.920 --> 27:52.600
<i>Brighton win a great chance</i>
<i>from Ulloa!</i>

27:52.680 --> 27:55.880
<i>Williams may have a sniff</i>
<i>of an opportunity here!</i>

27:57.680 --> 27:59.600
<i>Buckley's gone around him,</i>
<i>it's really inviting!</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:02.360
<i>What a save that is from Julian Speroni.</i>

28:02.440 --> 28:05.320
Things were going against us
and we were getting hosed in that game

28:05.400 --> 28:09.000
...because we got peppered the first half,
Jules had a few good saves.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.480
<i>I think we've seen which team</i>
<i>have finished</i>

28:10.560 --> 28:11.720
<i>the season very, very strongly</i>

28:11.760 --> 28:14.160
<i>and which team has struggled</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

28:14.240 --> 28:16.800
<i>Palace have not been themselves</i>
<i>in this first half.</i>

28:18.320 --> 28:19.880
Since that run of poor games,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.240
the full-backs are not quite
so brave going forward.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.000
I think a turning point
was the second half.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.200
<i>Still going, Zaha.</i>

28:36.280 --> 28:37.800
<i>Oh, he's done superbly well.</i>

28:37.880 --> 28:40.240
<i>Williams was there, Murray was there.</i>

28:40.320 --> 28:41.920
<i>Neither could get a touch.</i>

28:43.560 --> 28:45.760
<i>Can't do any more than, can he?</i>
<i>Wilfried Zaha.</i>

28:51.000 --> 28:52.720
We probably rid
our luck a little bit.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.440
<i>It's whipped in, you can see</i>
<i>Hammond clearly, just off side.</i>

28:56.520 --> 28:58.440
Just gritty, it felt like us.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.280
<i>It's Gabbidon.</i>

29:04.080 --> 29:05.640
We're not gonna lie down here.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.480
<i>It's Jedinak.</i>
<i>Kuszczak got a touch.</i>

29:19.560 --> 29:20.720
<i>Murray.</i>

29:25.080 --> 29:28.080
<i>Oh, he may well have hurt himself there,</i>
<i>Murray falls down.</i>

29:28.160 --> 29:30.360
<i>And he's writhing around in agony.</i>

29:30.440 --> 29:32.160
<i>This is not good for Crystal Palace.</i>

29:32.240 --> 29:33.600
<i>Not good at all.</i>

29:34.640 --> 29:36.600
It was a turn that I'd done

29:36.680 --> 29:39.360
hundreds of times that year
in games, in training.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.040
I've just chopped the ball back

29:41.120 --> 29:43.920
<i>and done a 360 on my right knee.</i>

29:47.960 --> 29:50.680
<i>I spoke to a lot of players</i>
<i>about this</i>

29:50.760 --> 29:52.280
<i>and the pain they felt.</i>

29:52.360 --> 29:54.080
And some lads,
they've walked out the stadium

29:54.160 --> 29:55.400
and come back in the next morning

29:55.480 --> 29:59.040
Been like, my knee's a little bit sore,
but for me it was excruciating.

30:00.160 --> 30:03.160
<i>And I can just remember sort of</i>
<i>lying on the floor screaming.</i>

30:03.240 --> 30:04.760
<i>And I had, like,</i>
<i>an out-of-body experience</i>

30:04.840 --> 30:07.960
thinking this game's live on television,
stop squealing

30:08.040 --> 30:11.200
because right now the camera
will be panning in on you.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.960
<i>And I couldn't stop.</i>
<i>I was in so much pain.</i>

30:13.040 --> 30:15.040
And I can just remember, I think it was

30:15.120 --> 30:19.000
Wayne Bridge that came over
to me and Matthew Upson.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.680
They were the first two.
They were just like,

30:20.760 --> 30:23.480
"Take it easy. Take it easy.
You're fine." And...

30:24.160 --> 30:26.760
Yeah, I just couldn't wait
to get off the pitch.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.920
Yeah, I never went back
in the dressing room

30:29.000 --> 30:30.200
for nine months.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.840
<i>That's a terrible, terrible sight.</i>

30:36.840 --> 30:38.440
<i>For all connected with Crystal Palace</i>

30:38.520 --> 30:40.000
<i>and for Glenn Murray.</i>

30:40.800 --> 30:42.160
<i>We all wish him well.</i>

30:42.240 --> 30:44.240
<i>I was distraught because I was thinking,</i>

30:44.320 --> 30:47.080
this guy scored 30 goals,
"What the hell, man?"

30:47.160 --> 30:48.280
Like, up to this day,

30:48.360 --> 30:50.560
Glenn's one of the best strikers
I've played with. 100%.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.840
To be honest, you're thinking
to yourself, "Wow."

30:52.920 --> 30:54.920
And I thought, "This doesn't look good."

30:55.000 --> 30:56.800
It's doom and gloom around the place.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.120
Around the ground you could feel
the ripples of panic,

31:00.200 --> 31:01.800
<i>when Glenn stretchered off</i>

31:01.880 --> 31:04.960
<i>because of the abysmal run that we'd had.</i>

31:05.040 --> 31:08.080
Thirty-one goals up until then
and it was heart breaking for the lad.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.960
At that precise moment
seeing him get injured,

31:11.040 --> 31:15.280
it was just like, "Oh my God,
like, what are we gonna do?"

31:16.360 --> 31:18.720
<i>These two great rivals could not be split</i>

31:18.800 --> 31:22.400
<i>after this first 90 minutes here</i>
<i>at Selhurst Park.</i>

31:22.480 --> 31:25.600
<i>Gustavo Poyet's Brighton,</i>
<i>came here looking for a clean sheet,</i>

31:25.680 --> 31:27.040
<i>they have that.</i>

31:27.120 --> 31:30.400
<i>Now they get the chance</i>
<i>to win it on home soil.</i>

31:30.480 --> 31:33.440
<i>To lose Glenn in the first game</i>
<i>here and play pretty poorly</i>

31:33.520 --> 31:37.440
and look second best in that game,
but the good news was, it was 0-0.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.200
We managed to hang in there
and we found a way as a team,

31:40.280 --> 31:42.440
as a group, as a football club
to get through it.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.840
The show must go on.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.080
Let's gather our thoughts and do
what we need to do next game.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.680
<i>Yeah, I do remember</i>
<i>the incident after the game.</i>

31:54.880 --> 31:59.440
Remember the comment that
their manager said after the game.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.400
The TV in the changing room was turned on
and Gus Poyet was talking about...

32:02.480 --> 32:04.680
His interview on Sky was being
put out live.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.280
I'm not gonna hide that, you know,
normally, you would say

32:07.360 --> 32:11.680
in a final against Palace anywhere
in the country 50-50, without any doubt.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.760
Now we are at home, I need to give
a little bit credit to my fans, you know,

32:14.840 --> 32:17.360
I put 55 or 60-40 percent for sure.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.440
And I just remember
thinking to myself, "Oh..."

32:22.120 --> 32:24.680
We were kind of sitting,
watching it and going,

32:24.760 --> 32:27.360
he is extremely confident there.
I suppose why wouldn't you be.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.440
They absolutely battered us
at the Amex in March.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.240
They'd battered us at Selhurst.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
They were on a 10-game,
12-game winning run

32:34.400 --> 32:37.680
or something like that.
They were, you know, the form team.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.360
And I suppose going down to the Amex,
no one gave us a chance.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.200
When you look at it from the outside,
you could see that,

32:42.280 --> 32:45.520
but I think people underestimated
the will in the group.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.880
I don't know if that's what you
want to use against this group,

32:47.960 --> 32:49.600
especially me, I was just...

32:49.840 --> 32:52.240
"I don't know about that.
We'll wait and see."

33:36.400 --> 33:38.440
Honestly, the worst.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.440
The worst I've ever see...
I can't.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.720
I literally--

33:44.680 --> 33:45.920
I'll never forget that.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.200
When you hear about it, you're kinda...
Your first reaction's...

33:49.280 --> 33:50.480
"That can't be right."

33:50.560 --> 33:56.160
You probably couldn't even dream
a scenario as humiliating for Brighton

33:56.240 --> 33:57.560
as the one that happened.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.360
If only there had been some
sort of camera crew on hand

33:59.440 --> 34:02.960
to film it as it was all going on,
it'd have been really nice

34:03.040 --> 34:05.600
to see some film footage
of it happening.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.800
<i>We were a little bit annoyed</i>
<i>in the bus ride coming in</i>

34:07.880 --> 34:11.040
because all the Brighton fans
had, like, Wembley 2013,

34:11.120 --> 34:13.120
like, waving for flags
and things like that

34:13.200 --> 34:15.920
and we got, we got pissed off for that.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.080
So we came off the bus
a little bit annoyed.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.280
<i>We arrived and I like to be</i>
<i>one of the first off the bus</i>

34:20.360 --> 34:21.600
walking down the tunnel.

34:21.680 --> 34:25.200
As I'm coming down the tunnel
I seen Ollie steam out the changing room.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.400
Who's in control of your stadium?

34:27.480 --> 34:30.080
And it's quite a bit of a walk
up the corridor

34:30.160 --> 34:31.560
to get in the dressing room.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.320
I remember Ollie was raging.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.560
-...the toilets in there?
-Yeah.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.760
Someone's deliberately done something
on our toilets. You need to find out...

34:38.840 --> 34:41.960
What’s the matter with him now, like?
But that wasn't an unusual occurrence

34:42.040 --> 34:43.200
to say something like that.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.920
It's none of my business, like,
went in the changing room...

34:46.000 --> 34:48.920
I was just focusing on the game
to be honest.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.520
The boys were, a few of them
were in and around and...

34:51.600 --> 34:53.200
I remember a couple of lads
were laughing,

34:53.280 --> 34:54.840
so I took my headphones out
and said, "What's happening?"

34:54.920 --> 34:56.360
Yeah, I needed a number two.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.480
And obviously, I couldn't.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.760
Whoever did that,
did us a big favour, really.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.480
So I want it cleaned up right now.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.720
-Okay. Yes.
-Is that fair enough?

35:06.240 --> 35:07.840
I just remember the smell.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.920
I swear to God, I don't think
I'll ever forget that memory

35:10.000 --> 35:12.240
of walking in
and just literally hitting you.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.480
That awful smell. What's that?

35:15.120 --> 35:16.200
I couldn't explain...

35:16.280 --> 35:17.240
What the hell?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.520
Horrendous.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.720
Absolutely dreadful.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.760
I put my washbag down.
I remember walking in

35:22.840 --> 35:25.280
and there was a stench
in the changing room. It stank.

35:25.360 --> 35:28.200
I didn't exactly see it,
just the smell and stuff.

35:28.920 --> 35:29.920
Just bizarre, man.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.680
It was like a bomb had exploded.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.480
The gaffer's just going crazy.

35:33.560 --> 35:38.040
I don’t expect that sort of shite
to happen at a place like this.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.520
-All right? With the greatest respect.
-Somebody's gonna--

35:40.600 --> 35:43.480
-Who's done that then?
-I don't know. It’s nothing to do with me.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.680
I'll tell you what, I’m gonna write
to the football league,

35:45.760 --> 35:48.120
with greatest respect,
absolutely bang out of order.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.040
Do you want to come in
and have a look?

35:50.120 --> 35:52.680
-If it's alright to come have a look.
-Yeah, of course it is.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.160
The truth was somebody had
missed the toilet deliberately

36:00.800 --> 36:02.000
with a number two.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.440
Someone's destroyed the toilet.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.840
Dropped a load and left it.

36:05.920 --> 36:06.960
Ollie thinks it's them.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.200
A bit of a...
Kind of derailing tactic?

36:09.280 --> 36:10.800
And then Ollie comes steaming
back in the changing room.

36:10.880 --> 36:13.680
Some of the words he came out with
I've never even heard before.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.600
And more than that
they put their gloves on

36:16.680 --> 36:18.360
and spread it
all around the floor,

36:18.440 --> 36:20.640
up the pan and over the seat.

36:21.080 --> 36:24.760
and then obviously, took their gloves off
and thought it was funny.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.600
Someone had pooed themselves.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.080
And was sick at the same time.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.360
That's how I'd describe it.
That's what happened.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.520
I've cleaned my daughter's nappies
and things like that.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.640
And been right up in the face
of it and this was just--

36:37.720 --> 36:40.280
I don't know too much...
I do know what happened and stuff

36:40.360 --> 36:43.360
but I didn't take myself
into the bathroom area.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.560
Could be anyone. I don't think anyone's
gonna admit. It wasn't me.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.880
Definitely wasn't me.
I was nervous, but I wasn't that nervous.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.280
Still I don't even know
what happened really.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.480
There's all different stories.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.800
Apparently, it was a bus driver
or something like that.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.440
Who knows what happened really.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.720
I mean, there's a lot of rumours around.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.400
The rumour has it that the coach driver
must've had a dodgy Ruby,

37:03.480 --> 37:06.240
and maybe had one too many
espressos before he drove in.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.240
It was coming out of both ends.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.000
That's what I believe is the story.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.360
The truth, I don't think
will ever really come out.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.200
I’ll just shake me head.

37:15.640 --> 37:16.800
Yeah.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.280
Move on anyway.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.320
You know, I just said,
"Lads, go outside."

37:20.400 --> 37:22.360
Ollie came in just like,
"Everybody, get out."

37:22.440 --> 37:24.400
I'm gonna deal with this.
He gave us 10 minutes.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.920
We came back
and it was all cleaned up.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.520
I remember Ollie was just fuming
and I thought...

37:29.600 --> 37:31.520
But he channelled it in the right way.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.880
You know, Ollie gets upset
but that's his business.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.880
It obviously upset him.
It's none of my business.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.640
My business is, you know,
four white lines and two goals.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.080
And that's where I need to be
focused on right now.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.080
I just think that actually
they're trying to upset us here

37:44.160 --> 37:45.960
and they must be a little bit scared.

37:46.040 --> 37:49.040
I think it was the biggest mistake
that they did because it spurred us on

37:49.120 --> 37:50.800
and made us wanting
to win the game even more.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.360
It didn't even sway me
at all from the game.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.360
It was just like we've come here
to do what we need to do.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.560
And let's do our best
to get it done.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.400
Ollie just come into his own.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.640
He used an analogy

38:02.720 --> 38:05.280
at the time of ten against one.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.480
<i>Ten Brighton fans to one of ours.</i>

38:08.560 --> 38:10.200
<i>So that's what you're up against.</i>

38:10.280 --> 38:12.280
So what are you gonna do about it?

38:12.760 --> 38:14.920
We got nothing to lose.
I've won here before.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.320
And I remember what it meant
to every one of those people.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.640
I said, "Wilf, the only way
we can prove we're better than them

38:20.720 --> 38:23.480
because we know we are,
let's just go and win.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.240
Let's go and win."

38:26.440 --> 38:28.600
<i>And the stadium built</i>
<i>when Brighton were in League One</i>

38:28.680 --> 38:31.120
<i>with the Premier League in mind.</i>

38:31.200 --> 38:35.040
<i>Now, has the Premier League in sight.</i>

38:35.920 --> 38:39.000
<i>And one of them will be joining</i>
<i>Gianfranco Zola of Watford</i>

38:39.080 --> 38:41.360
<i>at Wembley two weeks today.</i>

38:45.160 --> 38:48.040
<i>A place at final,</i>
<i>a pathway to the Premier League.</i>

38:48.120 --> 38:52.920
<i>And of course, this wonderful,</i>
<i>crackling derby atmosphere.</i>

38:57.800 --> 39:00.920
<i>Wilfried Zaha.</i>
<i>Oh, he's lost out to Buckley.</i>

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
<i>Speroni bails out</i>
<i>Wilfried Zaha and Palace.</i>

39:04.080 --> 39:05.800
<i>Brighton defenders,</i>
<i>it doesn’t matter how many,</i>

39:05.880 --> 39:07.760
<i>he's got the ability</i>
<i>to get around them.</i>

39:07.840 --> 39:11.920
<i>Had there been a Crystal Palace Striker</i>
<i>going into the danger area,</i>

39:12.000 --> 39:13.280
<i>they may have the lead.</i>

39:13.360 --> 39:14.720
<i>There is an awful lot at stake.</i>

39:14.800 --> 39:16.880
<i>135 minutes of football gone</i>
<i>in this tie</i>

39:16.960 --> 39:20.160
<i>and still no nearer to knowing</i>
<i>who is heading to Wembley.</i>

39:20.480 --> 39:22.480
<i>And Palace have started</i>
<i>with real purpose</i>

39:22.560 --> 39:25.240
<i>Zaha pulled back there by Bridcutt.</i>
<i>He's got away though.</i>

39:25.320 --> 39:26.760
When Wilf got the ball
from the counter attack,

39:26.840 --> 39:28.120
just remember busting a gut.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.720
<i>He's got Williams, who's on side.</i>

39:30.800 --> 39:32.240
<i>Wilf's pass was perfect.</i>

39:33.840 --> 39:36.680
<i>Williams for Palace! It's wide!</i>

39:38.880 --> 39:41.360
<i>Palace's best chance of the tie.</i>

39:41.440 --> 39:43.640
<i>But Jonny Williams rolls it wide.</i>

39:43.720 --> 39:45.320
You're thinking, "Oh, is it our day?"

39:51.520 --> 39:54.600
<i>It's a little touch on. It's a chance.</i>
<i>It's off the crossbar.</i>

39:54.680 --> 39:56.360
When you need your big players to turn up.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.640
A miracle save.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.320
It was just instinctive, really.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.640
All the training comes into
those moments.

40:01.720 --> 40:05.800
<i>That is a wonderful save.</i>
<i>It is an absolutely wonderful save.</i>

40:05.880 --> 40:08.640
Don't even remember how I did it.
Just went...

40:09.320 --> 40:10.320
...boom.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.680
<i>I had too much time I think.</i>

40:12.760 --> 40:14.640
<i>I actually think</i>
<i>that’s why he took me off.</i>

40:14.720 --> 40:16.120
You can see how much
it meant to me.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.080
I knew the substitutions
would be vital.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.600
And as the game was going on
and the more it was going 0-0,

40:21.680 --> 40:24.000
I was like, Yala, you're gonna come on
and win the game for us.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.920
I know what the boys are like.
you know everyone riled me up, you know,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.480
to make sure that I was still on it.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.200
If it had been me,
I'd have probably played him.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.040
Yannick coming on made
such a difference.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.240
And Brighty, he said to me,
"We got this, Steve."

40:35.320 --> 40:36.840
As a player, you get a sense.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.760
Even now off the pitch, where you think

40:38.840 --> 40:40.960
something's about to happen
and I nudged him and said,

40:41.040 --> 40:42.960
"We've got 'em. We've got 'em."

40:43.040 --> 40:45.400
And you just felt in that moment

40:45.480 --> 40:46.680
that the tide will turn.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.840
<i>In comes the resulting corner</i>
<i>towards Barnes!</i>

40:48.920 --> 40:50.400
<i>Off the line by Moxey.</i>

40:50.480 --> 40:52.880
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>This one is coming to the boil now.</i>

40:52.960 --> 40:54.480
<i>Crystal Palace can counter.</i>

40:54.560 --> 40:56.120
And the hair stood up
on the back of my neck.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.360
In that moment,
I knew that we had them.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.920
<i>Bolasie's gone across to the left,</i>
<i>to have a go at Calderon.</i>

41:02.000 --> 41:03.160
<i>Here he is.</i>

41:09.440 --> 41:11.840
<i>That will be delivered</i>
<i>to Aaron Wilbraham, oh it’s in!</i>

41:14.520 --> 41:18.600
<i>Wilfried Zaha</i>
<i>might just have had the biggest say</i>

41:18.680 --> 41:20.840
<i>of his Crystal Palace career!</i>

41:20.920 --> 41:23.520
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage.</i>

41:24.280 --> 41:26.040
<i>There's a small section</i>
<i>behind that goal</i>

41:26.120 --> 41:27.800
<i>going absolutely bananas</i>

41:27.880 --> 41:30.760
<i>but the rest of the stadium</i>
<i>had been stunned.</i>

41:36.800 --> 41:37.800
It was unreal.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.920
I could remember just staring
into the crowd

41:45.000 --> 41:47.640
and just everyone's going crazy.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.040
The directors' box erupt,
and the fans erupt.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.160
I'd literally never seen him
head the ball ever.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.520
Diving header.
Rare diving header.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.960
Wilfried takes the game
by the scruff of the neck.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
<i>Dikgacoi.</i>

42:16.640 --> 42:18.920
<i>Zaha. Oh, yes!</i>

42:23.080 --> 42:25.920
<i>Wilfried Zaha, single-handedly</i>

42:26.000 --> 42:27.800
<i>firing Palace to Wembley!</i>

42:34.360 --> 42:35.480
It's amazing.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.680
That night was crazy and--

42:36.760 --> 42:37.880
A night to remember.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.040
Special, man.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.280
Sheer euphoria.

42:40.360 --> 42:41.560
That was something else, man.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.600
I can't remember the goal,
I can just remember the excitement

42:43.680 --> 42:45.920
and just going crazy
in the directors' box

42:46.000 --> 42:48.800
and sort of thinking
we shouldn't be doing this.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.040
Better sit down quick.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.880
Yeah. It was a great moment.

43:02.960 --> 43:06.160
I remember just running down the pitch.
It was wild.

43:06.240 --> 43:10.080
As I was running, what I noticed was a lot
of the Brighton fans started leaving.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.560
<i>It is an incredible sight.</i>
<i>I'm really shocked.</i>

43:12.640 --> 43:15.400
<i>Surely, they should be staying behind</i>
<i>for the end of the game</i>

43:15.480 --> 43:17.600
<i>while their team stay on the pitch.</i>

43:18.200 --> 43:20.680
That is the ultimate satisfaction
you can get as a player

43:20.760 --> 43:22.360
that you've just pissed off

43:22.440 --> 43:24.000
30,000 Brighton fans.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.560
And I just remember thinking,

43:25.640 --> 43:29.200
if I could just freeze one moment
of my life, that would have been it.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.000
<i>He has been the difference here.</i>

43:31.080 --> 43:33.040
<i>Along with his goalkeeper, actually.</i>

43:33.480 --> 43:35.120
And it felt so good.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.080
It felt so good

43:37.920 --> 43:39.280
shutting them up.

43:40.560 --> 43:45.040
<i>Scoring that goal was just amazing, man,</i>
<i>and then the fans were right there</i>

43:45.120 --> 43:46.640
<i>running and celebrating.</i>

43:46.720 --> 43:49.040
<i>It was just...</i>
<i>That was an unbelievable night.</i>

43:49.120 --> 43:51.560
Believe it or not,
I relive that night sometimes.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.120
Like, I watch YouTube

43:53.200 --> 43:56.120
and try to relive that night sometimes
'cause it was unreal, man.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.960
The way he took his two goals,
it was, it was incredible, man.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.400
The second one was just unreal,

44:02.480 --> 44:04.840
<i>the way he just lashed it</i>
<i>into the roof of the net.</i>

44:04.920 --> 44:06.840
And as we were going back up,
I said to Gabbidon,

44:06.920 --> 44:09.000
"We're going to Wembley, Gabs."
And Gabs was like, "Yes, we are."

44:09.080 --> 44:10.760
There's no chance
they're gonna beat us here.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.160
We see the game out.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.560
<i>That's it. Some said it was</i>
<i>mission impossible</i>

44:15.640 --> 44:18.280
<i>but Wilfried Zaha stepped up</i>

44:18.360 --> 44:20.360
<i>to take Crystal Palace to Wembley.</i>

44:20.440 --> 44:24.360
<i>A shot in the 120-million pound game</i>
<i>at Wembley.</i>

44:24.440 --> 44:26.320
<i>To take his boyhood club</i>

44:26.400 --> 44:28.520
<i>through to the final of the playoffs,</i>

44:28.600 --> 44:31.280
<i>away at your arch rivals</i>
<i>and score the goals he did</i>

44:31.360 --> 44:34.200
<i>and the way he did,</i>
<i>yeah, you know, massive credit to Wilf.</i>

44:34.280 --> 44:36.600
He produced the goods that night
and that's what top players do.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.840
They produce the goods
when it matters.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.800
He decided he was gonna be
Glenn Murray in that game.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.560
Such was his love for the club.

44:43.640 --> 44:46.520
I think they did feel that
they'd kind of won it already.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.000
So ramming it down their throat

44:48.080 --> 44:49.960
with those goals from Wilf was fantastic.

44:50.360 --> 44:53.160
<i>Standing next to Martin Long</i>
<i>we were just cheering the Palace fans,</i>

44:53.240 --> 44:55.840
<i>who were cheering the players</i>
<i>and soaked it up.</i>

44:55.920 --> 44:56.960
The atmosphere was brilliant.

44:57.040 --> 45:01.880
What a moment and just all the tension
of the last of 10 games,

45:01.960 --> 45:04.360
<i>I think it was just lifted</i>
<i>in that moment.</i>

45:04.440 --> 45:06.560
It was like being a kid.
It was so exciting.

45:06.640 --> 45:10.080
<i>It's not just the fact that we beat them,</i>
<i>it's the fact that we beat 'em so well.</i>

45:10.160 --> 45:13.080
<i>Twenty-six thousand people were saying</i>
<i>stand up if you hate Palace.</i>

45:13.160 --> 45:14.560
Actually makes me feel quite good

45:14.640 --> 45:16.640
that somebody cares
that much about us, you know?

45:16.720 --> 45:18.080
That rivalry is great,

45:18.160 --> 45:20.440
and I'm sure it's one
that's gonna be continued.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.880
<i>In one way or another, that club</i>
<i>is gonna get into the Premier League.</i>

45:22.960 --> 45:24.840
<i>Hopefully, we're still there</i>
<i>to play them.</i>

45:27.080 --> 45:28.760
<i>I thought the boys ran over them</i>
<i>in the second half.</i>

45:28.840 --> 45:31.120
I thought we were stronger
and wanted it more.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.280
I just, I couldn't be
more proud of them.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.200
Yeah, that excitement,
I couldn't contain it, man.

45:46.280 --> 45:47.440
It was crazy.

45:47.920 --> 45:51.000
<i>To win a playoff semi-final</i>
<i>is always sweet,</i>

45:51.080 --> 45:54.040
<i>but to win it in the backyard</i>
<i>of your biggest rivals,</i>

45:54.120 --> 45:56.560
<i>well, that is priceless.</i>

46:07.360 --> 46:09.560
Huge moment.
Huge moment for this club.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.960
We're going to Wembley.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.440
A proper performance.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.920
We got the ultimate,
the ultimate outcome,

46:15.000 --> 46:16.960
which was to beat them
on their soil.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.680
<i>...talk about character, and that's why</i>

46:18.760 --> 46:20.800
<i>they've been able to dig deep</i>

46:20.880 --> 46:24.440
<i>and grind out a victory</i>
<i>over the two legs.</i>

46:24.520 --> 46:27.520
For me, it was one of the best moments
wearing a Palace shirt.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.840
And for the fans,
it's certainly a moment

46:29.920 --> 46:31.240
that they will never forget.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.480
<i>We're going Wembley.</i>
<i>It means the world to me.</i>

46:33.560 --> 46:35.160
<i>I played for Palace for like 10 years,</i>

46:35.240 --> 46:37.840
so doing this for Palace
is just perfect.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.120
<i>What about Ian Holloway?</i>

46:39.200 --> 46:42.160
<i>He is the playoff specialist.</i>
<i>He thrives on it, doesn't he?</i>

46:42.240 --> 46:43.560
<i>And he gets that siege mentality</i>

46:43.640 --> 46:45.360
<i>with his players</i>
<i>within the dressing room.</i>

46:45.440 --> 46:47.160
<i>Watford in the final,</i>
<i>what do you make of that?</i>

46:47.240 --> 46:49.880
They're a fantastic team.
So are we.

46:51.680 --> 46:56.600
And for all of us, could there have been
a better night beating that team,

46:56.680 --> 46:58.720
you know,
and getting to Wembley?

46:59.720 --> 47:01.080
Unbelievable, isn't it?

47:01.160 --> 47:03.640
I mean, everybody wrote us off,
didn't they?

47:03.720 --> 47:07.040
In all the bad run that we had,
everybody wrote us off,

47:07.120 --> 47:08.520
but that's what it's about, isn't it?

47:08.600 --> 47:10.880
They've stuck with us
through the bad times

47:10.960 --> 47:12.160
and you know what,
we're going to Wembley now.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.320
So we've got one game.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.560
We got a shot to get back
in the big team

47:14.640 --> 47:17.320
-Just tell us about the T-shirt.
-Oh, he's my roommate...

47:18.280 --> 47:21.440
I've been rooming with him
for year and a half now.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.880
Just, he's just one of the good guys.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.600
I feel absolutely devastated.
I'd been there myself.

47:26.680 --> 47:27.960
I know how he's feeling.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.120
So, hopefully, we can get
in the Premier League for him.

47:30.520 --> 47:33.120
Talk to me, Daze, two goals today.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.960
Daze. Talk to me, bro.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.400
I've got nothing to say, man.
Just fucking going to Wembley, mate.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.560
That's what I'm talking about. Rambo?

47:41.640 --> 47:44.120
What did I say to you?
What did I say to you?

47:46.160 --> 47:49.120
But the thing... Yala had obviously,
he had been dropped as well.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.640
And he was in bit of a bad place about it
and he was missing out on the games

47:52.720 --> 47:54.080
and it was eating away at him,

47:54.160 --> 47:55.720
and he played a massive part
when he came on,

47:55.800 --> 47:57.440
and he was just going around
with his camera.

47:57.520 --> 47:59.400
This is a crazy moment, you know,

47:59.480 --> 48:02.520
Yeah. And that's still
a classic video till today.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.200
Yeah! Yeah!

48:19.560 --> 48:21.080
Amazing after all these years

48:21.160 --> 48:22.920
of fighting and fighting
and fighting

48:23.000 --> 48:26.160
and then finally get there,
but I think we all knew that

48:26.240 --> 48:29.240
if we didn't make it,
if we didn't win that game,

48:29.320 --> 48:32.080
then it would have been for nothing.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.040
So we knew we had
a massive challenge in our hands

48:35.120 --> 48:38.680
and that final at Wembley that,
that was the match,

48:38.760 --> 48:40.600
that was the match
that we needed to win.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.320
<i>A place in the Premier League at stake.</i>

48:45.400 --> 48:47.080
<i>After 48 games,</i>

48:47.160 --> 48:50.800
<i>it all comes down to this</i>
<i>one season-defining game.</i>

48:51.280 --> 48:53.840
<i>The most mighty of prizes.</i>
