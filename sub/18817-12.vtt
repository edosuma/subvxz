WEBVTT

00:07.424 --> 00:09.176
[both moaning]

00:11.970 --> 00:14.014
-[horn honks]
-[both laugh]

00:16.266 --> 00:20.479
[sighs] Is it weird that we're
sneaking around to make out like kids

00:20.562 --> 00:23.524
-when our actual kids are waiting at home?
-Yeah.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.400
Before I left the house,
my 15-year-old told me

00:25.484 --> 00:27.444
to tone down the makeup
and be home by 11:00.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.862
Ah, screw her. She's so lame.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.741
That's weird.
My daughter said, "Fifth date, Dad.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.035
Don't bother coming home
unless you get some."

00:35.118 --> 00:36.161
She's three.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.705
Hmm. [chuckles]

00:38.789 --> 00:42.543
I hate to let her down, but I'm more
of a seventh-date kind of girl.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.711
Unrelated, do you want to go
on two dates tomorrow?

00:44.795 --> 00:46.338
[chuckles]

00:46.421 --> 00:49.341
Actually, my friends are having
a dinner party.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.467
Do you want to come?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.927
-[cell phone chimes]
-Ay!

00:52.010 --> 00:54.471
-Yeah, you're right. It's too soon.
-No, I wanna come.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.307
This  "ay"  was for my mom.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.019
My ex is coming back from Afghanistan
for Elena's  quinces,

01:01.103 --> 01:02.479
and she keeps texting me.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.649
"Pick up his favorite soda.
Pick up his favorite potato chips.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.193
Take him back,
so I can die a happy woman."

01:08.277 --> 01:09.278
[Ben] Hmm.

01:09.778 --> 01:13.532
So your mom's really into your ex.
That's... great.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.577
Victor's in the past.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.956
And I'm putting my phone on silent.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.292
[both] Mmm.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.711
[cell phone vibrating]

01:27.504 --> 01:29.882
-[Ben moaning]
-[cell phone chimes]

01:29.965 --> 01:32.301
[grunting] That's me.

01:34.386 --> 01:38.140
"Dear Lupe's friend. Is her phone
on silent, or did you kidnap her?"

01:40.726 --> 01:42.311
How does your mom have my number?

01:44.146 --> 01:45.355
I don't know.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.901
[theme song playing]

02:37.115 --> 02:38.992
[Victor over computer]
That really happened. I'm not kidding.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.912
[laughing]  Ay, qué bueno,  you are home.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.081
We are Skyping...

02:45.082 --> 02:50.546
a handsome,
available man in Afghanistan. [chuckles]

02:52.756 --> 02:53.882
It's Victor.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.136
Your husband?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.891
-[Victor]  Is that your  mami  I hear?
-Yeah, she wants to say hi.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.685
Hi, Victor! Everything good?
Great. See you next week.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.436
Mami,  I need some help in the kitchen.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.190
In a minute. Victor is showing us
a picture of a funny camel.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.651
It is very tiny.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.820
It has no humps.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.072
And... it is a dog.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.618
So... quick question.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.414
When  Papi's  here next week,
do I have to, like, hang out with him?

03:25.497 --> 03:29.168
[chuckles] The whole reason
he's coming home is for your  quinces.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.669
Plus, we haven't seen him
in over a year.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.380
I love  Papi,
but we have nothing in common.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.465
Every time we Skype,
we just stare at each other

03:35.549 --> 03:39.219
until one of us thinks the screen froze.
And sometimes I just pretend it--

03:39.887 --> 03:41.221
Look, I get it,

03:41.305 --> 03:42.890
-but it's only for a few days.
-[sighs]

03:42.973 --> 03:46.435
And, uh, where are we
with the idea of telling him?

03:46.518 --> 03:50.022
Oh, who thinks it's a good idea
to greet my Latino veteran dad with,

03:50.105 --> 03:51.857
"Hey, I like girls!"

03:53.567 --> 03:55.360
You'll finally have something in common.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.989
So, Lupita,
aren't you going to talk to Victor?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.073
No.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.659
Right, not the way you look.
Here, you need a lipstick.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.120
-Oh, thank you.
-[lipstick clatters]

04:05.204 --> 04:08.790
I am telling you,
he is back to how he used to be.

04:08.874 --> 04:13.128
I know he says he's sober, which is great,
but he needs to get actual help

04:13.212 --> 04:15.464
or the drinking and the pills
could start all over again.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.716
Plus, he's not even dealing with his PTS.

04:17.799 --> 04:21.762
Oh, but he looks so healthy.
His skin is glowing.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.013
Hashtag, no filter.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.892
[sighs] Victor and I are not
a thing anymore.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.936
-Okay? You got it?
-Of course.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.271
Oh, give him a chance.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.317
Remember how
you two used to sing the karaoke?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.277
And dance into the night?

04:37.361 --> 04:39.488
[gasps] And remember your wedding day?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.782
God, I looked beautiful.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.953
Ooh, what are you doing,  papito?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.622
Since  Papi  can't be here
for my cello recital tomorrow,

04:48.705 --> 04:50.541
I'm gonna play my part
of the quartet for him.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.595
My God, he is a genius.

05:05.389 --> 05:08.600
It makes more sense
when the other three people are playing.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.102
I wish you could be here.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.186
[Victor]  Oh, yeah.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.772
Wouldn't it be cool if I could do
that  Star Trek  thing

05:13.856 --> 05:15.899
where I could just transport there?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.985
I'd be all,  "Oye,  Scotty,
beam me up, yo."

05:18.068 --> 05:20.487
-[knocking at door]
-[chuckles]

05:22.447 --> 05:23.657
Whoa, it worked.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.701
I was aiming for the living room.
I just missed.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.286
-Papi!
-[chuckles]

05:27.369 --> 05:29.538
-[thud]
-[Victor] You grew!

05:30.747 --> 05:32.249
-Papi!
-[chuckles]

05:36.128 --> 05:39.506
Okay. Wow, look at you.
Beautiful, huh?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.508
You must be breaking all the boys' hearts.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.428
[chuckles nervously]

05:45.846 --> 05:47.389
Looking good,  viejita.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.474
Vente pa' ca. Dame un beso.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.809
[chuckles]

05:54.146 --> 05:55.397
[Lydia speaking Spanish]

05:55.480 --> 05:58.275
[continues speaking Spanish]

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
Okay, let's break it up.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.069
Everyone has told everyone
they're attractive.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.405
[chuckles] Hiya, Lupe.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.449
Hi.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.202
Well, this is a surprise,
because it's not a week from now.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.455
But it's all good,
'cause I got your many messages and texts

06:11.538 --> 06:13.665
telling me you were coming early.
Oh, wait.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.793
-None of that happened.
-[Victor] Yes.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.504
I know, I'm early,
but I really wanted to surprise

06:18.587 --> 06:20.339
papi chulo  over here
and see his cello show.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.465
-Awesome.
-[chuckles]

06:21.548 --> 06:24.426
Qué  nice,  qué  thoughtful...

06:25.219 --> 06:28.305
Kay Jewelers.
They sell engagement rings.

06:32.351 --> 06:35.354
-And anyway, Lupe, I booked a hotel.
-Okay, that sounds good.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.480
That sounds outrageous.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.983
He is family.
Family doesn't stay in a hotel.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.194
Would you want me to live in a hotel?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.908
-Hello?
-No, no, no.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.118
Exactly.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.542
You understand. You know,
we weren't expecting you for another week,

06:56.625 --> 06:59.461
and if you just drop in
out of the blue like this,

06:59.545 --> 07:01.463
you can't really expect us
to be ready for you, it's--

07:02.047 --> 07:03.131
Ready.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.887
Wow.
Is that a pillow mint? [chuckles]

07:08.971 --> 07:09.972
Can't  Papi  stay here,  Mami?

07:12.266 --> 07:13.267
Yeah, sure.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.769
¡Perfecto!

07:15.853 --> 07:19.231
You can have my bed.
I will sleep with Lupe.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.567
Unless...

07:21.650 --> 07:23.485
-No, it's fine.
-He can stay out here.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.239
-Ay, qué cosa linda. Gracias.
-Claro.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.658
Victor made breakfast.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.160
He told me to relax.
Isn't he marvelous?

07:32.244 --> 07:34.580
Someone should take him off the market.

07:36.665 --> 07:37.791
- Toma, Lupe.
-Oh.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.126
-Good morning, Elena.
-Morning.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.919
Hey, I made your favorite.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.756
Clown face pancakes. Huh?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.761
Let me guess,
you don't like clowns anymore.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.764
Or faces.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.935
I just like to start with a protein
because studies show

07:57.019 --> 07:58.145
it's better for developing brain--

07:58.228 --> 08:00.355
Clown pancakes, what?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.650
It's about to be a circus in my stomach.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.029
[chuckles] That's what I meant to say.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.156
Yeah. Oh, uh...
Quick, before you go to school,

08:09.239 --> 08:11.491
I have something for you guys.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.952
I didn't get a chance
to do this last night. [sighs]

08:14.036 --> 08:16.455
-But, uh, I hope you like it,  papito.
-[chuckles softly]

08:16.538 --> 08:18.624
Oh, maybe you can open that after...
Okay.

08:21.543 --> 08:25.088
Dang! A new PS4! Are you kidding me?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.298
Oh, my God. Thanks.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.301
Of course you can't play it
unless your homework's done

08:29.384 --> 08:30.594
and only when  Mami  says it's okay.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.640
And I'm just realizing I should've
asked her before I even gave it to you,

08:34.723 --> 08:37.935
so now I'm just gonna stare this way
and you tell me what her face is doing.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.103
-You can keep it.
-Yes.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.648
But if you mess up,
it goes up on the shelf no one can reach.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.400
-RIP Super Soaker.
-[Victor chuckles]

08:46.735 --> 08:48.111
And for Elena...

08:51.782 --> 08:52.908
[gasps]

08:59.206 --> 09:01.124
[Victor] I know
that you're a little too old for it.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.294
But hear me out, okay? She's a princess.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.089
But a Latina princess.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.883
Yeah.
And she's all, like, empowered.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.176
Yeah, she don't need no prince.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.974
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.225
Thank you. [chuckles]

09:19.351 --> 09:21.019
Hi, princess. I'm Elena.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.357
[imitates doll] "Hi.
My body proportions aren't representative

09:25.440 --> 09:27.276
of a typical girl my age."

09:30.612 --> 09:32.948
[in normal voice] At least you know.

09:33.031 --> 09:37.286
Yeah. And... and she comes with a purse,
and, uh, pajamas...

09:37.369 --> 09:39.830
and, um, a receipt.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.750
Solid effort. Come on, you guys.
Let's go. You gotta go.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.294
We'll see you after school at the recital.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.296
-Can't wait.
-[Lydia] I'm going to go, too.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.506
I will leave you two alone.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.134
-Where are you going?
-Grocery shopping.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.594
At 7:00 in the morning?

09:53.677 --> 09:54.928
I like to beat the traffic.

09:55.012 --> 09:57.306
-You're walking.
-Foot traffic.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.934
It must be nice to have
someone to help out,

10:01.018 --> 10:02.060
go grocery shopping.

10:02.144 --> 10:06.648
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Without her list or her purse.

10:06.732 --> 10:07.900
Or leaving.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.284
[sighs] So...

10:18.160 --> 10:20.954
You're making breakfast,
you're being thoughtful.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.540
What are you doing?

10:24.499 --> 10:26.168
Just trying to be a decent dude.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.962
I'm not the same person
I was before I left.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.715
-I mean, I'm still crazy cute.
-[scoffs]

10:31.798 --> 10:35.552
But, uh, I'm off the pills. I'm sober now.
Been working a program.

10:35.636 --> 10:36.887
-That's great.
-Yeah.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.307
And the other stuff, the PTS?
I'm dealing with it.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.101
I'm in a good place, Lupe.
I'm a new guy.

10:43.852 --> 10:44.895
Trying to be, anyway.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.230
Good.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.399
Good. I'm in a good place, too.

10:50.526 --> 10:51.652
Which...

10:52.569 --> 10:55.155
Ay,  so, look. So I'm just gonna
put it out there. I'm seeing somebody.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.241
What? Who is he?
I'm gonna kick his ass.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.912
Is what the old Victor would have said.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.372
Right? Yeah.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.750
But the new Victor says, "Get it, girl."

11:08.377 --> 11:10.712
-Okay. [laughing]
-It's all good.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.131
I'm just telling you
because I don't want it to be weird.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.967
Although it was weird
that you told me to get it.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.721
But, uh, tonight, me and him have a thing.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.267
-Okay.
-So you're cool?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.561
Well, I don't love it. [scoffs]

11:25.644 --> 11:28.355
I mean, who is this guy?
Is he a big part of your life?

11:28.939 --> 11:30.023
Hey, Pen!

11:34.194 --> 11:36.530
Which shirt do you think is better
for the cello recital?

11:36.613 --> 11:39.199
I feel like the green one
really brings out my eyes.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.453
But then I thought
it might be fun if we did

11:43.537 --> 11:45.622
a "the whole family wears blue" thing.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.082
Hi, I'm Victor.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.254
Is this the guy you're seeing?

11:52.963 --> 11:54.590
[both laughing]

11:54.673 --> 11:56.341
[both] Oh, my God!

11:56.425 --> 11:59.219
-You think he and I?
-Like we would ever!

11:59.303 --> 12:00.345
[both laughing]

12:01.805 --> 12:04.099
Oh, my. Whoo! I needed that.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.143
Oh, man. Me, too. That was funny.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.730
Oh, hey, man.
I'm Schneider, by the way.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.984
[clears throat] She never told me
you were so funny.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.695
So you're just the guy
who takes my son out to baseball

12:16.778 --> 12:18.113
and does all that dad stuff?

12:18.864 --> 12:19.948
[laughing]

12:22.409 --> 12:23.952
Are we still laughing?

12:24.786 --> 12:26.747
-I'm not.
-I am.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.501
'Cause I'm afraid to stop.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.503
You know what, I gotta be honest,

12:32.586 --> 12:35.130
I think I was happier when I thought
you were sleeping with my wife.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.049
Oh, sure, yeah.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.092
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

12:39.676 --> 12:40.552
Uh...

12:41.303 --> 12:44.431
I never come down here
shirtless or pantsless.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.142
I never come down here.
How did I get here? I'm gonna go.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.146
Okay. But we'll see you
at Alex's recital, right?

12:51.230 --> 12:52.606
Oh...

12:52.689 --> 12:56.902
Yeah, I just remembered I double-booked
with another middle school concert.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.030
[chuckles] Recital season, am I right?

13:01.073 --> 13:04.535
Schneider. Come on, don't be ridiculous.
Of course you're coming.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.454
You'll both be there, and it'll be
a good chance to get to know each other.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.623
Yeah. Come on, man.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.167
You should come. I insist.

13:14.670 --> 13:15.838

13:39.903 --> 13:41.446
Look at you two,

13:41.530 --> 13:45.659
all over each other
like the old days. [laughs]

13:45.742 --> 13:51.415
Remember, love is the thing
that keeps you warm in the night.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.001
It is the quilt of passion.

What happened to
love is the quilt of passion?

14:05.179 --> 14:06.805
Yeah, that quilt is too old.

14:11.810 --> 14:12.978
Are you okay there, buddy?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.813
Yep, yep, yep.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.150
Glad to be here as a family acquaintance
to support your son.

14:18.233 --> 14:21.653
[clears throat] What's his name? Alvin?
I don't know. We're not that close.

14:22.446 --> 14:26.241
Hey, great job coaching
Alex's swing this season.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.785
Widening his stance really made him
a monster at the plate.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.078
You must be so proud.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.958
He lives here.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.506
Early onset dementia. Sad.

14:42.549 --> 14:46.011
Listen, man, relax.
It's good, what you're doing for Alex.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.471
I'm not around.
You should keep doing it.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.391
Although I won't be
over there much longer.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.893
-You won't?
-Nah.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.937
Private security in Afghanistan?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.856
I mean, it's not exactly the kind of job
you can grow old in. [scoffs]

14:57.940 --> 14:59.566
Yeah, I know.
That's what I said when you went over.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.027
Yeah. You were right.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.156
-Mom.
-What? What's wrong?

15:06.240 --> 15:08.992
Mrs. Aaron's van got a flat,
and she was moving all the instruments.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.410
I don't have my cello.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.579
I don't have my Jell-O either.

15:18.502 --> 15:19.628
This sucks.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.256
Bad news, everyone.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.550
-No recital today.
-[all groan]

15:24.633 --> 15:26.927
I really wanted to show you
in front of everybody.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.179
You never get to be here for my stuff.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.932
-We have to do something.
-What do you mean?

15:32.015 --> 15:35.102
We gotta stall. I didn't come all this way
to not hear my boy play the cello.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.729
Schneider, I have a mission for you.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.692
I need you to locate and recover that van,
and retrieve those instruments ASAP.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.569
You got it, Dad. I mean, dude.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.904
I mean...
I'm not looking for a father figure.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.783
All right, we need a diversion
until they get back.

15:49.867 --> 15:50.909
Are you in, Sergeant Alvarez?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.453
What do you have in mind,
Sergeant Alvarez?

15:53.537 --> 15:55.956
All right, everyone, uh,
before you all leave,

15:56.039 --> 15:57.916
I happened to notice your karaoke machine.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.586

Thank you, active seniors of Silver Lake!

16:42.211 --> 16:44.046
Do you want to hear it a fourth time?

16:44.129 --> 16:46.131
I didn't hear it the first three times.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.718
Oh, and now,
I couldn't be prouder to introduce

16:49.801 --> 16:53.722
the St. Bibiana String Quartet,
starring cello superstar, Alex Alvarez.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.432
[cheers and applause]

17:06.276 --> 17:08.111
-[mouths] Thank you.
-[mouths] You're welcome.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.953
You glad you came back early for this?

17:17.329 --> 17:18.539
We messed up on a lot, but, uh...

17:19.373 --> 17:21.375
I know a couple of things we got right.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.923
[sobbing]

17:31.385 --> 17:33.220
-Whoo-hoo!
-[all laughing]

17:33.303 --> 17:34.680
[Lydia] Oh!

17:34.763 --> 17:36.807
We were so awesome!

17:36.890 --> 17:38.183
[Victor] Wow. Yeah.

17:38.267 --> 17:41.186
I mean, we probably added five years
to those old-timers' lives.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.773
And  papito,
you were the best one in that quartet.

17:44.857 --> 17:46.984
I mean, that's why they gave you
the biggest violin.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.404
Thanks. Can we set up the PS4 now?

17:50.487 --> 17:52.114
I don't know. What do you say,  Mamita?

17:53.824 --> 17:55.993
-Yes.
-Great. Oh, uh, but first...

17:56.076 --> 17:57.536
I have something for Elena.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.914
-[Lydia] Ooh.
-Um, yeah, I'm sorry about the doll.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.749
Uh, I know sometimes I still think

18:02.833 --> 18:04.585
that you're a little girl.
But you've changed.

18:04.668 --> 18:07.754
And I haven't been so good at keeping up.
But I want to.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.262
A donation to Kiva... in my name!

18:15.345 --> 18:17.264
Why are you giving money
to a guy named Kiva

18:17.347 --> 18:20.642
when you could be giving money
to a guy named Alex?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.645
Oh, Kiva is an organization
that gives a loan to a small business

18:23.729 --> 18:25.939
in a developing nation. They're amazing!

18:26.023 --> 18:27.649
How did you know I would like this?

18:27.733 --> 18:28.901
Well, I did a little research.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.320
And, uh, well,
somebody told me you were... What was it?

18:31.403 --> 18:32.613
Annoying.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.991
[Victor chuckles softly]

18:36.074 --> 18:37.826
A... a social justice warrior.

18:37.910 --> 18:38.994
Same thing.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.332
Anyway, I don't know exactly
how this works,

18:43.415 --> 18:45.876
but if we're ever in Tibet,
we can visit a kickass yak dairy.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.462
[squeals] Thanks,  Papi!

18:48.545 --> 18:50.422
But we're still sharing that PS4.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.549
I like video games, too.
Girls like video games, too.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.051
-Don't you even.
-[Victor chuckles]

18:55.636 --> 18:58.722
I'm in, too.
I wanna  Dance Dance Revolution.

18:59.473 --> 19:00.891
Don't you have a dinner thing?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.603
Oh, that's right. [chuckles]

19:04.686 --> 19:07.105
Aw, it's true love.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.526
I'm sure Juliet forgot
her date with Romeo.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.444
[Penelope] Aw.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.740
Okay. Let me get outta here.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.409
-And I'll see you guys later.
-[both] Bye, Mom.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.328
-Bye.
-Okay, let's do it.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.538
I'm gonna beat you,  Papi.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.248
Just like I used to beat you
in  Connect Four.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.374
[Elena and Victor] Ooh.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.959
[Victor] Tough talk, huh,  papito?

19:27.042 --> 19:30.254
I actually got called to duty, so there's
no way you can beat me at this game.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.965
And Elena, you can't cheat
in this game like you do in  Scrabble.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.592
[Elena] For the last time,
seax is a real word.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.970
-It's a Scandinavian roofer's tool.
-[Alex chuckles]

19:38.053 --> 19:40.347
[Victor] Wow.
You make  Papi  feel real dumb sometimes.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.140
[all laughing]

19:42.224 --> 19:44.309
[Victor] All right,
let's set this thing up, guys.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.980
Lupe, one sec.

19:50.774 --> 19:51.900
Tonight was fun, right?

19:51.984 --> 19:55.279
Yeah. It was nice to have someone
to share the load. [chuckles]

19:55.362 --> 19:58.365
Listen, I... I hope we're on our way
to being good, you know,

19:58.448 --> 19:59.867
which is why I got a present for you, too.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.252
-The divorce papers.
-Yeah.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.130
I know you've been after me
to sign them, so I did.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.215
Once you do, it'll be official.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.844
[sighs]  Ay.  Wow.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.387
[both chuckle]

20:24.850 --> 20:25.893
Thank you.

20:55.547 --> 20:56.882
[Victor sighs]

21:05.307 --> 21:06.767
Have fun at your thing.

21:14.191 --> 21:16.151
-That was great, wasn't it?
-Oh, so great.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.986
I absolutely loved your friends.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.364
I can't believe that Emily and I went
to the same grade school.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.491
And we both mistrust the balloon guy
at the farmer's market,

21:22.574 --> 21:24.159
'cause that guy is full-on sketchy.

21:24.243 --> 21:25.369
[chuckles]

21:25.452 --> 21:29.373
Sebastian and Peter are so cute.
Their wedding pictures were so romantic.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.792
Love wins! We have to break up.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.422
Are you intimidated
by Sebastian and Peter?

21:37.506 --> 21:39.258
They have their problems, too, you know.

21:39.341 --> 21:42.219
I've seen Peter fat-shame Sebastian.
It's not pretty.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.429
It's not that.

21:45.472 --> 21:49.560
[sighs] I just have a lot
going on right now, you know.

21:49.643 --> 21:53.689
Between the  quinces,
my family coming into town,

21:53.772 --> 21:55.357
my ex being back...

21:56.942 --> 21:58.360
It's not fair to you.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.574
If I can't be here, I shouldn't be here.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.286
Yeah. Yeah.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.747
And your ex being back.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.625
[sighs]

22:15.335 --> 22:17.212
It's okay.

22:17.296 --> 22:18.338
I get it.

22:21.758 --> 22:25.470
So... we're stopping after six dates.

22:26.597 --> 22:27.639
Perfect! [chuckles]

23:16.647 --> 23:18.899
You watching me sleep, creepy lady?

23:20.442 --> 23:22.069
[chuckling]

23:23.320 --> 23:26.073
I should've known something was up.
You weren't snoring.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.450
[chuckles] How was your thing?

23:29.576 --> 23:30.869
It was fine.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.456
Home by 11:00? I don't think so.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.710
Why are you with such a snooze, huh?
We know you have good taste.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.255
[sighs]  Ay.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.424
Well, if you must know,
I broke up with him.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.010
Oh, no.

23:48.095 --> 23:49.346
Stop smiling.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.683
Was I smiling?
You better look closer.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.852
No, no, no, no.
Come on, no. None of that.

23:54.935 --> 23:56.311
Come on, I swear, I just wanna spoon.

23:56.395 --> 23:57.771
[scoffs] Oh, yeah.

23:58.939 --> 24:00.607
You just wanna spoon?

24:01.650 --> 24:03.694
I invented that move.

24:03.777 --> 24:07.322
Come on, let's just cuddle, naked.

24:07.406 --> 24:09.032
Nothing can happen.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.200
[chuckles]

24:10.284 --> 24:12.327
And then nothing turned into Elena.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.915
Come on. Just for a minute.

24:37.186 --> 24:39.062
[both sigh heavily]

24:42.774 --> 24:44.985
So, thanks for the divorce papers.

24:47.779 --> 24:50.657
Yeah, I can't wait
to get you outta my life. [chuckles]

24:51.867 --> 24:54.536
Oh, God, it's just so weird.

24:54.620 --> 24:58.457
[sighs]  Mami's  convinced
that we should get back together.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.293
Ah, that  viejita's  no dummy.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.308
-What?
-Why do you smell like beer?

25:18.018 --> 25:20.229
Oh, uh, I had a few before bed.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.190
-[chuckles]
-[gasps] Okay.

25:23.273 --> 25:26.735
[stammering] Uh, I mean, what do we do?
We call your sponsor, right?

25:26.818 --> 25:29.571
I mean, is he in Afghanistan? Here?
What? Where is he?

25:29.655 --> 25:30.906
-No. No, no, no, no.
-Yeah!

25:30.989 --> 25:33.450
'Cause that's part of
working the program, right?

25:33.534 --> 25:35.911
Look, it's not that kind of program.
All right?

25:35.994 --> 25:37.704
What the hell kind of program is it,
Victor?

25:37.788 --> 25:39.706
Okay, look,
you're gonna have to trust me on this.

25:39.790 --> 25:43.001
All right? I'm doing my own thing.
And it... And it's working. I promise.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.546
Yeah, it seems like it's working.

25:45.629 --> 25:49.883
Uh, listen, Penelope.
Okay, look, I'm off the pills, all right?

25:49.967 --> 25:52.094
And honestly, if I feel like having
a couple of Coronas

25:52.177 --> 25:54.388
at the end of the day
to take the edge off, that's...

25:54.471 --> 25:57.224
that's a hell of a lot better
than when I'd pop a fistful of Vicodin

25:57.307 --> 26:00.185
and watch 17 hours of HGTV. [scoffs]

26:00.269 --> 26:01.895
Though I now know what a sconce is.

26:01.979 --> 26:05.816
[sighs] Don't joke about this!
You lied to me!

26:05.899 --> 26:08.527
No, I didn't lie, okay?
I told you that I'm better and I am.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.404
-You're not gonna give me credit for that?
-No, I'm not.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.657
No. Not with your history,
and not what we've been through.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.909
You need to be in a real program.

26:15.993 --> 26:17.536
Oh, what, at the VA?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.746
So I can wait a month
to talk to some  comemierda

26:19.830 --> 26:21.331
who's never even seen a second of combat?

26:21.415 --> 26:22.791
No, I don't think so. I'm not doing that.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.960
Oh, so... so just to be clear...

26:25.043 --> 26:26.628
you're not seeing anyone about your PTS?

26:26.712 --> 26:30.007
Look, I'm doing stuff, okay?
Look, I'm keeping busy. I'm working out.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.133
-[sighs] Oh, God.
-All right?

26:31.216 --> 26:33.677
I can't believe
I let you do this to me again.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.679
Stop!
Stop overreacting over a few beers.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.431
-Overreacting?
-Please!

26:37.514 --> 26:40.851
How many beers was it when you punched
a hole in the wall above the bed, huh?

26:41.643 --> 26:42.728
How many beers was it

26:42.811 --> 26:44.146
when you woke the kids up
in the middle of the night

26:44.229 --> 26:46.231
to say goodbye
'cause Daddy was gonna kill himself?

26:46.315 --> 26:47.316
Huh?

26:49.318 --> 26:52.279
I'm not saying this to hurt you.

26:52.362 --> 26:54.990
I am saying this because I love you...

26:56.658 --> 26:59.328
and I know who you are in here.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.788
I remember who you were.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.832
You've been through some hard stuff, babe,

27:03.916 --> 27:06.710
and... and that's not your fault,
but you need real help.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.128
I'm helping myself!

27:08.629 --> 27:09.880
I'm doing what I'm doing, okay?

27:09.963 --> 27:12.007
And if you don't like it,
well, then, that's your problem.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.134
[Penelope sighs]

27:17.304 --> 27:19.640
Yeah, you're right. That is my problem.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.267
And I can't have that problem here
with the kids. So, you gotta go.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.228
Stay at that hotel.

27:24.311 --> 27:27.856
And the next time I see you
is gonna be at Elena's  quinces.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.775
-All right. Hey, look, I'm... I'm sorry.
-No!

27:29.858 --> 27:31.109
-Come on, Lupe.
-Please!

27:32.110 --> 27:33.237
Just go.

27:36.573 --> 27:37.574
Okay.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.256
Lydia. Lydia,  háblale. Por favor.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.383
Huh?

27:55.551 --> 27:57.511
No, Victor.

27:59.346 --> 28:00.430
Go.

28:22.619 --> 28:23.871
[Penelope sighs]

28:28.584 --> 28:30.502
[Penelope cries gently]
