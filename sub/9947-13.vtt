WEBVTT

00:08.360 --> 00:10.759
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.760 --> 00:13.239
sending prices sky high,

00:13.240 --> 00:16.799
literally, literally
taking the grass from its own roots.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.959
And now you've got your
Con-Dem-nation,

00:19.960 --> 00:23.359
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.199
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.200 --> 00:31.119
Is revolution a word or was it never?

00:31.120 --> 00:35.119
Anybody watching needs to know we cope
better than average with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.359
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.360 --> 00:43.119
and they charge us for water?

00:43.120 --> 00:47.119
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found,

00:48.440 --> 00:51.639
this green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.640 --> 00:54.239
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:54.240 --> 00:57.519
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.119
This is our England now.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.119
Party!

01:03.319 --> 01:08.119

01:08.160 --> 01:12.159
The biggest mistake in life is
to believe someone belongs to you.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.919
I was 12 when I worked that one out.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.959
Mum died.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.759
I learnt that love and loyalty
are only a false sense of security.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.759
So if you've an ounce of nous,
don't give yourself away,

01:25.160 --> 01:28.959
cos in end, whether it's
out-growing each other,

01:28.960 --> 01:32.959
falling out of love, death,
all relationships fall apart.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.279
"Elizabeth, I sense and
feel your frustration,

01:39.280 --> 01:42.799
"but please, I implore you,
don't give up.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.759
"Happiness to those who dream
dreams, and are set to pay

01:45.760 --> 01:48.079
"the cost to make them come true.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.079
"Sincerely, Martin."

01:54.680 --> 01:56.679
Do you want a drink?

01:56.680 --> 01:58.119
Just an orange juice.

01:58.120 --> 02:02.039
Sub us a tenner.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.199
20 will do.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.279
Micky.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.158
Oi. You're barred.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.479
Back off.
You know he's on probation.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.839
Yeah, well, it's his
own fucking fault.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.599
You've been clamped.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.599
Shane's got to do Jackson's
poncey community action project

02:21.840 --> 02:23.559
as a condition of his probation.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.319
He's on his final warning.
If he fucks this up

02:26.320 --> 02:30.319
he'll be growing carrots with
some nonces in a cat C prison.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.599
Leave it be. For me.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.439
Ground rules. No drinks.

02:38.440 --> 02:42.439
And you leave as
soon as you're done.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.599
Silent treatment?
Very fucking mature.

02:49.480 --> 02:53.159
It's my colleagues and the people
I deliver to - they're all nasty.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.919
Plus I never see Frank.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.919
These days we're less Cathy and
Heathcliff and more Sid and Nancy.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.359
I'm tired when I get in, he's out,

03:02.360 --> 03:06.159
I get up early, he's passed out.
We're not making love.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.519
Too much information.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.599
Post for you.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.479
Tits and testes? Mimi, this is
supposed to be a night to raise

03:22.480 --> 03:25.719
awareness on the serious issue
of breast and testicular cancer.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.479
Cancer's depressing enough as it
is without been reminded of it.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.479
People want to have fun. We'll put
the happy into chemo ther-appy.

03:33.400 --> 03:37.399
I'm organising this and I want prestige not
notoriety for my community action project.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.879
Er...my pub.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.879
Yeah, our pub.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.239
Bet he's loving this.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.279
Who cares what he thinks?
I only agreed to this because

03:52.280 --> 03:54.187
the clamping turned us
into social lepers.

03:54.307 --> 03:55.678
If people see us eat humble pie,

03:55.798 --> 03:58.440
it'll win us favour and
we'll be back in business.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.176
Tilly's an inspiration.

04:00.296 --> 04:02.599
Her sort's the heartbeat
of this nation.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.133
Do you know how many charities miss
out on funds

04:04.253 --> 04:06.456
because she monopolises
all available donations?

04:06.576 --> 04:09.926
She's an innocent. She's a mate
of Rick Astley's and Sonia's.

04:10.046 --> 04:11.753
Ruthless as Rupert Murdoch.

04:11.873 --> 04:14.936
She's demanding 40% of the money
I raise for her own charity.

04:15.056 --> 04:18.599
Whatever. This place will
be packed to the rafters.

04:18.600 --> 04:22.599
We'll rake it in cos of her.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.199
How much longer do we have
to humiliate ourselves for?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.079
Permanently.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.679
I have been picking Jackson's brains
about starting our own charity.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.719
You what?

04:40.720 --> 04:43.959
I'm not talking about shifting
aid to third world shitholes.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.079
We'll be helping the plight of
the stranded expat pensioner

04:47.080 --> 04:50.439
in Marbella or the poverty
stricken kids of Hawaii.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.199
Anything that'll guarantee
us an all-year-round tan.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.639
Kelly and Shane feed the world?

04:55.640 --> 04:59.639
Yeah, pay ourselves a high wage, so
it's first class travel, gold taps,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.959
whatever we want. I'll register
first thing tomorrow.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.079
Give us your fucking money!

05:04.080 --> 05:08.079
Give us your fucking money!

05:12.360 --> 05:16.359
I hand him his post, we sit on the
bench opposite his house and talk.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.879
Sometimes we're hours.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.639
We've a lot in common.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.439
He, like me, has a condition.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.879
We both share a passion
for the art of letter writing

05:27.880 --> 05:29.479
and a disappointment
in its decline.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.399
You'll be telling me you finish...

05:31.400 --> 05:33.799
Off each other's sentences.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.279
Yes, we do. Mainly

05:37.280 --> 05:41.279
cos sometimes we're incapable
of finishing our own.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.719
Say cheese.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.319
Eh, you fucking pervert.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.679
This is research for a
serious disease, Frank.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.839
Do you think I want to spend
my night touching men's balls?

05:54.840 --> 05:56.159
It's making me sick.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.679
We decided to write and
exchange letters to keep

05:58.680 --> 06:00.839
the spirit of letter writing alive.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.679
That's all. Martin's a good friend.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.399
Talking about him turned your nipples
so hard you could've had me eyes out.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.399
It's not me you need to convince.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.359
I've, er, run out of gloves, though.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.199
I'm going to have to do it bareback.
You don't mind, do you?

06:21.200 --> 06:25.199
It'll be the first feel I've copped
for in weeks. Knock yourself out.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.319
Just so you know, the lump on me
right breast is just my third tit.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.519
It's got its own nipple.
I'm a biological wonder.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.319
Other booth, Lillian.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.039
What?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.719
Other booth!

06:37.720 --> 06:41.319

06:41.320 --> 06:45.319

07:30.960 --> 07:33.399
Thank you all for
your generosity so far,

07:33.400 --> 07:37.399
and a special thank you
to one person in particular.

07:38.440 --> 07:42.439
He's been my right hand man.
Mr Shane Maguire, come on up!

07:48.200 --> 07:51.999
Shane's been inspired to start
his own charity because of me.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.999
How about that, eh? I'm sure
you'll have all of our support.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.559
Shane Maguire!

07:57.560 --> 08:01.559
Thanks, everyone.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.439
Where do you think you're going?

08:03.440 --> 08:06.719
Business. Not that it's
got fuck all to do with you.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.439
You've turned the family
against us, what more do you want?

08:10.440 --> 08:14.199
That was your doing.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.199
Tilly'll see you now.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.839
How you doing? You all right?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.399
And shut the door.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.399
Sit.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.839
Erm, I wondered if you would referee

08:42.840 --> 08:46.839
and help get my charity
registration approved?

08:46.840 --> 08:49.479
Would you be a gent?

08:49.480 --> 08:51.839
It's medicinal.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.839
Our secret?

08:56.520 --> 09:00.199
Mum said I made my first million
before I was three months old.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.319
I can make you dead popular.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.879
So you'll do it then?

09:03.880 --> 09:07.879
Oh, sorry!

09:09.320 --> 09:10.519
What are you doing?

09:10.520 --> 09:12.399
Be mine and I'll get
you what you want.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.399
What are you talking about?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.519
You think I'm ugly.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.919
Come here.
No, I don't.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.799
I've never had a boyfriend.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.159
I'm married.

09:24.160 --> 09:24.879
I'll pay you.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.199
Listen, you are a kid.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.919
You will find... you will find
someone that's your own age.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.879
Are you saying that because of my condition
I should only stick to basket cases?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.839
No, I didn't mean that.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.839
Know what people say about me? You can get
into bed with Tilly but you don't fuck Tilly.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.519
On the other hand...

09:42.520 --> 09:44.639
Oh, Jesus, you are sick.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.999
I'll make sure you're never
approved. Get back here.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.999
No one says no to me!

09:55.080 --> 09:57.199
Do you know anything about abortion?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.199
Like what?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.439
Reasons to have one...

09:59.440 --> 10:00.959
Shit. You're not?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.999
Shut up.
Got a debate in school tomorrow.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.039
Got to argue for pro choice.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.639
I don't believe in it.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.639
Except for him.
He's a walking advert for abortion.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.439
If you're having an abortion and

10:15.440 --> 10:18.239
some ethical shithead tells
you that you're a murderer,

10:18.240 --> 10:21.799
you're morally obligated to hit
them really hard in the face.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.719
Get us another one in and
I'll tell you some more.

Don't normally get custom

12:10.477 --> 12:13.357
For starters, abortion
could eradicate gays,

12:13.782 --> 12:16.341
cos, let's face it,
gays can't reproduce, can they?

12:16.342 --> 12:21.807
So who's making all the gay babies?
Think about it.

12:22.091 --> 12:26.449
And what about the dilemma of knowing
the risk of a baby being born

12:26.569 --> 12:28.622
with a debilitating birth defect?

12:28.742 --> 12:32.741
Or worse, if that baby
is David Cameron.

12:32.822 --> 12:35.941
Speaking of which, abortion should
be compulsory for ugly people.

12:35.942 --> 12:39.337
Just imagine if Anne Widdecombe
and John McCririck conceived.

12:39.457 --> 12:41.199
The mere thought sends you reaching
for a bottle of

12:41.319 --> 12:43.708

You're losing Libby.

14:33.982 --> 14:36.061
I think to someone
she's met at her job.

14:36.062 --> 14:40.061
Of course you're always
too tanked-up to notice.

14:40.182 --> 14:42.541
Well, it took its fucking time.

14:42.542 --> 14:43.261
What?

14:43.262 --> 14:47.061
Dementia has finally set in.
Hallelujah!

14:47.062 --> 14:48.861
I'm serious.

14:48.862 --> 14:51.181
Libby's not like anyone else.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.621
She has affairs of the mind.

14:53.622 --> 14:55.501
You know better than anyone
how she retreats

14:55.502 --> 14:57.381
into her fictional fantasies.

14:57.382 --> 15:00.101
God knows you took
advantage of it...

15:00.102 --> 15:02.301
Heathcliff.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.781
She's started doing it again.

15:04.782 --> 15:06.501
Why would you give a shit?

15:06.502 --> 15:09.271
You've done nothing but try
and split us up from day one.

15:09.391 --> 15:11.063
You can't stand it

15:11.183 --> 15:14.877
that me and Libby are genuine, so don't
give me your fucking head games.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.341
I won't deny that, but I'm no fool.

15:17.342 --> 15:19.501
Better the devil you know.

15:19.502 --> 15:23.501
And if this man is superior to you,
which I suspect he is,

15:25.302 --> 15:29.301
we'll both lose her.

15:43.302 --> 15:47.301
I want you to quit your job. It's
costing us more than you're bringing in.

15:47.422 --> 15:51.421
These bills. The only thing your
job guarantees is that we get them!

15:57.142 --> 16:01.141
There's no point
keeping this from you.

16:01.622 --> 16:05.621
They've stopped
your benefits, Frank.

16:06.342 --> 16:09.421
Oh, I know. Yeah.

16:09.422 --> 16:11.021
Told me to get a job
or lose my sick pay.

16:11.022 --> 16:13.061
Told them to stick it.

16:13.062 --> 16:17.061
How can I do manual
labour with my back?

16:17.622 --> 16:21.621
You selfish arse. I can't do this,
I can't slave to make ends meet,

16:21.782 --> 16:23.741
while you piss it up
against the wall.

16:23.742 --> 16:27.141
It's only a six-month suspension.
Then I can make a fresh claim.

16:27.142 --> 16:29.621
Six months. What makes you
think I'll still be here?

16:29.622 --> 16:33.621
Trust me, got it all covered.
Coming into a little inheritance.

16:34.222 --> 16:35.261
You're not listening.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.941
You don't care,
don't love anyone, especially me.

16:37.942 --> 16:38.741
Yeah, I d...

16:38.742 --> 16:39.781
Ey, you! >

16:39.782 --> 16:42.781
Tish is being
threatened with suspension.

16:42.782 --> 16:45.221
Well, what you telling me for?

16:45.222 --> 16:47.541
I paid for his pint so he'd
help me with my debate at school,

16:47.542 --> 16:50.061
but instead he filled my
head with all kinds of crap.

16:50.062 --> 16:52.141
It's not my fault
she's thick as shit!

16:52.142 --> 16:54.661
I've seen her trying to
eat yoghurt with a fork.

16:54.662 --> 16:58.661
That's not because she's thick,
it's because she's too bone idle

16:58.822 --> 17:01.421
to wash a spoon, you twat.

17:01.422 --> 17:05.060
You'll go to Letitia's school
and you'll put things right.

17:05.061 --> 17:07.300
Let's be rational here.
Jackson must know what to do.

17:07.301 --> 17:10.015
He's a teacher.

17:10.135 --> 17:12.381
The less he knows, the better.

17:12.382 --> 17:15.032
It's complicated

17:15.153 --> 17:16.424
but the bottom line is

17:16.544 --> 17:20.352
I want what's best for my daughter.
You understand that.

17:21.862 --> 17:25.309
You have to meet with the teacher
and save Letitia's school career

17:25.429 --> 17:28.461
by whatever means necessary.
Have I fuck.

17:28.462 --> 17:30.181
Let me put it another way.

17:30.182 --> 17:34.943
I want you to do it
and if you love me, you will.

17:39.742 --> 17:41.581
They say charity is a selfless act.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.541
Load of shit. It's like Shane.

17:44.542 --> 17:48.541
I'm being crucified, held to ransom,
for my own charitable conceit.

17:49.062 --> 17:50.421
What?

17:50.422 --> 17:54.421
The pissing teachers meeting at
some posh girls' school, bastards.

17:55.622 --> 17:57.701
Micky, get on the phone
to the solicitors.

17:57.702 --> 17:58.901
I want Shane out the nick.

17:58.902 --> 18:02.301
Tell him to cheat, bribe,
whatever to make it happen.

18:02.302 --> 18:04.741
You're joking?

18:04.742 --> 18:06.621
He's dragged us down the shitter.

18:06.622 --> 18:10.621
Cos of what he's done, people won't
deal with us, we're losing business.

18:12.582 --> 18:16.581
He's been sentenced to two weeks. He
knows a way out but we'll need your help.

18:16.662 --> 18:19.461
Done the decent thing and owned
up to stealing the charity money?

18:19.462 --> 18:21.061
No. He didn't take the money!

18:21.062 --> 18:25.061
Who took it then?

18:28.982 --> 18:32.421
Thought so.
What he did was despicable.

18:32.422 --> 18:33.981
Gutless.

18:33.982 --> 18:37.981
So don't come crawling to us
expecting help. He can rot.

18:45.142 --> 18:48.181
Kelly.

18:48.182 --> 18:49.461
That was out of order!

18:49.462 --> 18:52.701
If we take Shane's side
over this, we're fucked.

18:52.702 --> 18:56.701
I won't let that happen.

18:57.702 --> 19:01.701
Whether Letitia Powell used your
work or not, it's inexcusable.

19:01.862 --> 19:05.861
I have to go ahead
with her suspension.

19:09.502 --> 19:13.501
I'm surprised you show such a lack of concern
for the academic future of a young girl.

19:14.142 --> 19:18.141
One who, by all accounts, you are
responsible for potentially damaging.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.421
I was expecting a fight on my hands.

19:21.422 --> 19:25.421
What else can I do? Got plenty of kids
of my own to know they're a lost cause.

19:25.542 --> 19:29.501
You don't strike me as
the married family sort.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.821
Well, I'm not. Married, that is.

19:32.822 --> 19:35.301
Except to my job.

19:35.302 --> 19:38.301
Work in a brewery.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.901
I'm boarded here 24/7.

19:39.902 --> 19:43.381
I've sacrificed a lot for
my dedication to teaching.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.021
And for what?

19:45.022 --> 19:49.021
Year after year of sneering,
ungrateful, pubescent bitches.

19:51.062 --> 19:55.061
Our lives are thankless existences.
But we mustn't moan, eh?

19:56.062 --> 19:58.221
We could help each other.

19:58.222 --> 20:00.541
I'm sure you understand.

20:00.542 --> 20:04.541
A man in your position,
a woman in my position.

20:06.462 --> 20:08.981
We both have needs
that our commitment

20:08.982 --> 20:12.981
to our careers cannot fulfil.

20:13.422 --> 20:17.421
I'll excuse Letitia.
In return for a spot of cunnilingus.

20:20.182 --> 20:24.181
Licky, lick equals win-win.

20:27.022 --> 20:28.261
You're suspended.

20:28.262 --> 20:29.941
You're not the first, you know.

20:29.942 --> 20:31.861
She tries it on with all the dads.

20:31.862 --> 20:35.141
It's a good job I'm not yours then...
You knew this was going to happen?

20:35.142 --> 20:39.141
Libby said to help me by
whatever means necessary.

20:40.302 --> 20:44.301
Don't do it and I'll tell
everyone that you nonced me.

20:53.662 --> 20:57.661
Oi, you little shits.

21:05.422 --> 21:09.421
I'll get it washed off as soon as.

21:41.582 --> 21:45.541
I'm not living here when you lot
have turned your back on Shane.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.981
Jamie's got what he wanted.

21:47.982 --> 21:50.381
I've let things go too far.

21:50.382 --> 21:53.221
No more.

21:53.222 --> 21:55.501
And I'll be fucked before
I let anyone around here

21:55.502 --> 21:57.821
accuse me of being a bad mother.

21:57.822 --> 22:00.021
We want to help clear Shane's
name and get him out the nick.

22:00.022 --> 22:02.301
So what's his plan?

22:02.302 --> 22:06.301
File in a sponge cake? Spring him
out through the prison shit pipe?

22:06.782 --> 22:10.141
♪ Damn, the doctor's
just finished telling me

22:10.142 --> 22:11.821
♪ There's no time

22:11.822 --> 22:14.461

MUSIC STOPS

22:16.702 --> 22:18.701
Did you bring some
white stuff as well?

22:18.702 --> 22:22.701
I know I said I don't do cocaine,
I just like the smell.

22:22.822 --> 22:26.821
What's wrong?

22:31.462 --> 22:33.661
But please, I've got a
rare internal organ disease.

22:33.662 --> 22:36.981
Only one in eight million
have what I have.

22:36.982 --> 22:37.781
Whatever.

22:37.782 --> 22:40.221
Doctors can't help, getting
off my tits is the only way

22:40.222 --> 22:41.981
of numbing this constant ache.

22:41.982 --> 22:45.461
Fine, tell everyone!
No-one will believe you anyway.

22:45.462 --> 22:47.781
Go on, get out! Get out!

22:47.782 --> 22:51.781
Shut it!

22:52.982 --> 22:53.821
Shit!

22:53.822 --> 22:54.861
Shit!
Wait.

22:54.862 --> 22:58.861
Mimi!

23:02.142 --> 23:03.181
(Is she dead?)

23:03.182 --> 23:07.181
Get up, bitch. I've raised enough
kids to know that wasn't a seizure.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.181
It was a hissy fit.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.861
Micky was a bastard for them.

23:12.862 --> 23:16.861
I had borderline epilepsy!

23:17.222 --> 23:21.221
Get the fuck up.
You've got some work to do.

23:31.982 --> 23:34.541
I'm not the victim in all of this.

23:34.542 --> 23:38.541
Shane is. People like him
need love, support, educating.

23:38.702 --> 23:42.261
That's why I'm dropping all charges
and requesting his immediate release.

23:42.262 --> 23:43.821
Thank you.

23:43.822 --> 23:44.981
Thanks.

23:44.982 --> 23:47.021
Thanks, bye.

23:47.022 --> 23:51.021
OK ladies,
can you come together please?

23:55.062 --> 23:59.061
'Is it possible to be in love
with two people at the same time?'

24:19.462 --> 24:23.461
DOOR OPENS >

24:30.422 --> 24:33.501
Something up?

24:33.502 --> 24:37.501
Nothing.

24:38.542 --> 24:41.861
You OK?

24:41.862 --> 24:45.861
Well?
Did you go?

24:45.942 --> 24:47.541
Course I did.

24:47.542 --> 24:51.061
You fixed it for Letitia?

24:51.062 --> 24:55.061
Yes, yes! Ravage me with your
tongue, you dirty savage!

24:57.222 --> 25:01.221
I did it for you.

25:01.942 --> 25:02.981
Beer?

25:02.982 --> 25:06.581
If it's not too much trouble.

25:06.582 --> 25:10.581
Nothing's too much
trouble for my man.

25:10.662 --> 25:14.381
And for proving your love, treat
yourself down the Jockey later.

25:14.382 --> 25:18.381
(BURPS)

25:18.542 --> 25:22.541
Have you been eating tuna?

25:22.622 --> 25:26.621
Yeah, it kind of lingers.

26:01.748 --> 26:03.587
Where did you get it?

26:03.588 --> 26:06.907
I think you're missing the
shitting point, Libby. Who's Martin?

26:06.908 --> 26:08.467
A friend.
A friend?

26:08.468 --> 26:11.101
"I can plug the hole in your existence."

26:11.301 --> 26:13.915
Yeah, we can guess what fucking
hole he's talking about.

26:14.188 --> 26:15.627
D'you love him?

26:15.628 --> 26:16.467
I love...

26:16.468 --> 26:20.467
Then why is there a whole paragraph
dedicated to yours truly?

26:20.828 --> 26:23.067
He calls me a cunt.
How does he know that?

26:23.068 --> 26:24.227
Because I told him!

26:24.228 --> 26:27.107
I told him everything - good and bad.

26:27.108 --> 26:31.107
But I never, I swear, Frank.
We're just pen friends.

26:31.868 --> 26:34.147
Nothing physical happened, nothing!

26:34.148 --> 26:37.387
What happened is
ten times worse than that.

26:37.388 --> 26:41.387
You opened up, you connected
emotionally to another man,

26:42.348 --> 26:46.347
that's what hurts...the most.

26:50.988 --> 26:52.827
And all this, Libby,

26:52.828 --> 26:56.827
if he loved you with all the power
of his soul for a whole lifetime,

26:58.188 --> 27:02.187
he couldn't love you
as much as I do in a single day.

27:02.228 --> 27:05.267
There's an address here,
he wants to meet.

27:05.268 --> 27:09.267
So, if being with me
is so unbearable,

27:10.188 --> 27:12.427
if I'm so wicked,

27:12.428 --> 27:15.587
take the letter and go.

27:15.588 --> 27:19.587
But remember, nothing God or Satan
could inflict would have parted us.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.507
You, of your own will, did it.

27:24.508 --> 27:27.427
I have not broken your heart,

27:27.428 --> 27:29.987
you have broken it.

27:29.988 --> 27:31.867
And in breaking it,

27:31.868 --> 27:35.867
you have broken mine.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.187
Whatever our souls are made of,

27:39.188 --> 27:40.867
yours and mine are the same

27:40.868 --> 27:44.307
and Martin's is as different
as a moonbeam from lightning,

27:44.308 --> 27:48.307
of frost from fire.

27:50.668 --> 27:54.667
THUNDER

28:23.228 --> 28:27.227
Aidan.

28:27.788 --> 28:30.347
What are you doing?

28:30.348 --> 28:33.107
Libby said things are going to be
really tight for cash.

28:33.108 --> 28:33.747
So?

28:33.748 --> 28:35.507
We need money and I'm doing my bit.

28:35.508 --> 28:39.507
I'm going to burn the van out for the
insurance. No-one knows, so keep it zipped.

28:39.588 --> 28:41.747
Before you go,
I'll have a 99-er please.

28:41.748 --> 28:44.027
I don't sell ice cream,
it's a library.

28:44.028 --> 28:45.227
Oof!

28:45.228 --> 28:46.147
Let me come.

28:46.148 --> 28:47.947
No! It's too dangerous for you.

28:47.948 --> 28:51.947
Oh, come on.
It's boring round here.

28:58.108 --> 29:02.107
No way.

29:03.628 --> 29:07.627
Letitia Powell!

29:10.588 --> 29:12.467
I knew it.
You didn't...

29:12.468 --> 29:14.787
No. I found them...
in your ice cream van.

29:14.788 --> 29:16.627
Me own daughter?

29:16.628 --> 29:20.627
It wasn't me!

29:24.908 --> 29:28.227
Frank lives here.

29:28.228 --> 29:29.867
I'd like a word with
Frank Gallagher.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.267
He's not here, can I help you?

29:32.268 --> 29:35.147
I doubt it.
It's a private matter...

29:35.148 --> 29:38.227
Concerning his lack of oral hygiene.

29:38.228 --> 29:39.387
She's got herpes.

29:39.388 --> 29:42.347
Excuse me,
that is another month's detention.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.587
Not fair,
everyone else is saying it.

29:45.588 --> 29:46.707
Who are you?

29:46.708 --> 29:48.467
Who are you?

29:48.468 --> 29:52.467
I'm Frank's fiancee.

The Jockey.

30:02.548 --> 30:04.987
Yep, he's here.

30:04.988 --> 30:07.067
All right, keep your fucking wig on.

30:07.068 --> 30:08.587
Frank, you're wanted at home.

30:08.588 --> 30:10.427
I am home.

30:10.428 --> 30:13.947
It sounded serious.

30:13.948 --> 30:16.907
Family meal tonight.
Wear your Sunday best.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.267
Shane's homecoming.

30:18.268 --> 30:20.507
He's back in the business.

30:20.508 --> 30:24.267
He broke every agreement we made for
his independence, almost ruined us,

30:24.268 --> 30:27.587
and you're taking him back
and throwing him a party?

30:27.588 --> 30:31.587
Our blood. He was lost, son,
and now he's found.

30:32.116 --> 30:33.793
Tilly's little statement wasn't
worth shit

30:33.913 --> 30:35.987
and didn't get people
back drinking in here - I did!

30:37.165 --> 30:40.276
I made it clear that anyone can have
a pop at Shane with no comeback from me.

30:40.396 --> 30:41.394
I'm not going back on that.

30:42.668 --> 30:44.867
He's in, I'm out.

30:44.868 --> 30:47.427
I hate Dad.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.947
I do.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.987
He constantly put me and Shane down.

30:51.988 --> 30:55.507
He controlled us that much, you'd
think we came with fucking remotes.

30:55.508 --> 30:57.787
So I was made up when you took over.

30:57.788 --> 31:00.867
But you're a massive disappointment.

31:00.868 --> 31:03.387
Cos even though
he put the business before us...

31:03.388 --> 31:07.387
he never did when it counted.

31:21.068 --> 31:22.267
Cheating prick!

31:22.268 --> 31:25.347
Aidan. Aidan!

31:25.348 --> 31:29.347
We know what you did
with Letitia's teacher!

31:34.588 --> 31:35.827
Could you leave us?

31:35.828 --> 31:36.867
Are you...

31:36.868 --> 31:39.107
Mother. Now.

31:39.108 --> 31:43.107
Aidan.

31:54.188 --> 31:57.427
Jesus.

31:57.428 --> 32:01.427
It didn't mean anything.

32:02.668 --> 32:04.027
I didn't want to do it.

32:04.028 --> 32:08.027
That little bitch next door,

32:08.268 --> 32:10.627
she threatened to shout, "Nonce!"

32:10.628 --> 32:14.627
It's only oral.
Oral doesn't constitute as cheating.

32:16.708 --> 32:20.707
Anyway, you're not exactly
whiter than white though, are you?

32:22.948 --> 32:26.947
You know, what about that
flowery letter-writing twat Martin?

32:31.348 --> 32:35.347
I...did it...for you.

32:39.868 --> 32:41.107
It was your fault.

32:41.108 --> 32:45.107
"Any means necessary," you said.

32:54.588 --> 32:55.947
Come on, say something.

32:55.948 --> 32:57.907
Shout, scream, hit me.

32:57.908 --> 32:58.947
Hit me, go on!

32:58.948 --> 33:00.907
Anything.

33:00.908 --> 33:04.627
Ooh!

33:04.628 --> 33:08.627
If I start, I won't stop...

33:12.948 --> 33:15.747
..until you're dead.

33:15.748 --> 33:18.027
Is this the inheritance?

33:18.028 --> 33:21.867
I need help, Lib.

33:21.868 --> 33:24.147
"Proud people breed sad sorrows..."

33:24.148 --> 33:26.027
Don't you dare!

33:26.028 --> 33:30.027
My Heathcliff, my saviour.

33:30.068 --> 33:34.067
I see you now. Really see you,
like everyone else always has.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.987
The other day,
lying in bed beside you,

33:36.988 --> 33:40.987
I reached out to stroke your head
and my hand stopped mid-air.

33:41.788 --> 33:43.667
The oddest urge took over.

33:43.668 --> 33:46.347
My hand didn't want to
stroke your head any more.

33:46.348 --> 33:49.267
It wanted to fucking punch it in!

33:49.268 --> 33:53.267
I resisted those urges, fooled myself
into living a fantasy with you - had to!

33:53.948 --> 33:57.827
Because when it faded,
all I felt was...

33:57.828 --> 33:59.707
hatred, resentment,

33:59.708 --> 34:02.067
and I didn't want to believe that.

34:02.068 --> 34:04.667
You knew what buttons to push...

34:04.668 --> 34:05.787
when it suited.

34:05.788 --> 34:08.147
So I let you.

34:08.148 --> 34:10.226
I know it sounds fucked

34:10.228 --> 34:12.027
and you're not going to believe me,

34:12.027 --> 34:15.827
but what I did, I did for you.

34:15.828 --> 34:17.306
You're a liar and a thief

34:17.308 --> 34:18.827
and worst of all,

34:18.828 --> 34:20.427
knowing what you've done,

34:20.428 --> 34:22.147
you gave me an ultimatum!

34:22.148 --> 34:24.507
You or Martin.

34:24.507 --> 34:26.786
That was unfair.

34:26.788 --> 34:29.067
So now I know the truth,
I get to choose again

34:29.068 --> 34:31.867
and you're going to help me.

34:31.868 --> 34:35.547

I can't be with you any more.

Cheer up, hun.
It's just till the heat's off.

I can't see Jamie welcoming
me back with open arms,

35:42.958 --> 35:45.717
not after t' way he reacted
to the wheelchair business.

35:45.718 --> 35:48.597
Your mam has the final say
and if he doesn't like it,

35:48.598 --> 35:49.957
he knows where he can go.

35:49.958 --> 35:53.957
About time he was put in his place

Chemical Mitch.

39:11.998 --> 39:13.637
Remember?

39:13.638 --> 39:17.637
You set me up to think he'd
near drowned me, so I'd kill him.

I thought it'd be for your own good.

39:26.278 --> 39:27.557
I didn't plan...

39:27.558 --> 39:31.557
You weren't supposed to kill him.

39:33.598 --> 39:35.757
A-a-argh!

39:35.758 --> 39:39.757
I have been haunted by that every

I close my eyes, I can see them.

40:01.278 --> 40:03.837
And it drives me to the edge, Shane,

40:03.838 --> 40:06.037
that sometimes the only thing

40:06.038 --> 40:10.037
I can think of to make it stop
is to end it all.

40:11.278 --> 40:14.037
But then I think of Connor,

40:14.038 --> 40:16.317

40:17.998 --> 40:21.997
