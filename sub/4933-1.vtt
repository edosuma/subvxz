00:00.306 --> 00:03.469
Neighbors, may I have your attention?

00:03.609 --> 00:06.077
All you folks that have come
from far and wide...

00:06.145 --> 00:09.478
Henry here wants me to thank you
for coming to help him raise his barn.

00:09.549 --> 00:10.777
Thanks, folks.

00:10.883 --> 00:13.784
And he thanks the ladies
for all the fancy victuals.

00:16.356 --> 00:19.416
Since the barn's got four sides,
there's going to be four teams.

00:19.492 --> 00:22.484
The team that gets their side up first
wins the little heifer.

00:22.562 --> 00:24.291
Henry, show them Annabel.

00:27.667 --> 00:31.831
Now, get your teams set up, neighbors,
and lets see who wins the little lady.

00:32.572 --> 00:34.733
Adam, we could use her on the farm.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.641
How about it, boys?

00:37.810 --> 00:41.405
Mr. Perkins, put the seven of us brothers
down for one team.

00:41.914 --> 00:44.348
Milly says she's taken a fancy to Annabel.

00:44.417 --> 00:46.578
You hear, boys? That was Adam Pontipee.

00:46.652 --> 00:50.281
Last time he came to town, he bragged
how he always got what he set out for.

00:50.356 --> 00:51.482
And danged if he didn't.

00:51.557 --> 00:53.388
He's a hard one to beat, I'm warning you.

00:53.459 --> 00:55.154
- Don't worry.
- We'll handle them.

00:55.228 --> 00:56.490
That's the spirit.

00:56.562 --> 00:58.393
We got a team all set up here, Pete.

00:58.464 --> 00:59.795
And here's your fourth, Pete.

00:59.866 --> 01:02.357
- That's fine. Got your hammers and all?
- Yeah!

01:02.435 --> 01:03.595
Then take your positions.

01:03.669 --> 01:07.127
The sooner you raise the barn,
the sooner you get the victuals.

01:13.279 --> 01:15.110
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

01:15.782 --> 01:16.908
Let's go!

01:28.294 --> 01:29.454
Come on, Adam.

01:29.529 --> 01:31.053
Come on, Frank.

01:49.816 --> 01:52.114
My fault. Sorry,
I shouldn't have had my hand there.

01:52.185 --> 01:53.243
What happened?

01:53.319 --> 01:54.445
Nothing.

01:58.825 --> 02:00.816
Caleb, get that board up there.

02:02.395 --> 02:04.056
Now what happened?

02:04.864 --> 02:06.627
I stubbed my big toe.

02:06.699 --> 02:07.961
Come on, let's get going.

02:08.033 --> 02:10.467
Hey, Frank, get those sideboards up here.

02:13.005 --> 02:14.973
Hurt yourself, Frankincense?

02:20.546 --> 02:22.070
Well, come on, let's go!

02:22.148 --> 02:23.775
What's wrong with you boys today?

02:23.850 --> 02:25.545
Just a little dizzy spell.

02:32.024 --> 02:33.389
Hold it! Take it easy!

02:33.459 --> 02:35.324
He didn't drop that hammer. He threw it!

02:35.394 --> 02:37.328
- We don't want no fight!
- We promised Milly.

02:37.396 --> 02:39.626
We're gonna keep it calm,
so don't start anything.

02:39.699 --> 02:41.098
Come on, we're way behind now.

02:41.167 --> 02:43.328
She's made you
into a bunch of momma's boys.

02:43.402 --> 02:45.427
They're out to murder you,
and what do you do?

02:45.538 --> 02:48.871
Apologize for living! You're a disgrace
to the Pontipee name!

02:49.175 --> 02:52.667
You're a bunch of lily-livered,
chicken-hearted, lick-spittles.

02:54.847 --> 02:57.941
Serves you right!
I hope they break your necks!

03:08.594 --> 03:10.425
All right, Gideon, let's go!

03:12.899 --> 03:13.991
Why're you doing that?

03:14.066 --> 03:15.658
He ain't done nothing!

04:18.598 --> 04:20.656
Boys! Stop the fight!

05:34.840 --> 05:36.000
Witch hazel.

05:37.910 --> 05:39.070
Split lip.

05:42.148 --> 05:43.843
Don't smile for a few days.

05:43.916 --> 05:44.974
Next.

05:47.086 --> 05:48.678
Two beefsteaks. Frank?

05:50.022 --> 05:51.489
A kick in the pants.

05:51.791 --> 05:52.815
Next?

05:53.259 --> 05:55.523
A loose tooth and swolled-up knuckles.

05:55.895 --> 05:59.262
A wonder you have any teeth left at all.
Witch hazel, please.

05:59.498 --> 06:00.590
I'm sorry, Milly, honest.

06:00.666 --> 06:03.362
But when that fella took after Adam,
an innocent bylooker...

06:03.436 --> 06:04.926
I understand, Gideon.

06:05.037 --> 06:07.028
You all did your best, I guess.

06:08.507 --> 06:09.838
Good night, boys.

06:13.312 --> 06:14.677
Good night, Milly.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.144
- Good night, Milly.
- Good night, Milly.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.782
I feel awful strange-like, Milly. Here.

06:26.092 --> 06:29.960
If it's what I think ails you, Gideon,
witch hazel's not going to help.

06:35.134 --> 06:36.931
Alice is sweet, isn't she?

06:39.171 --> 06:40.263
Good night.

06:54.153 --> 06:57.919
What's the matter with you?
Somebody butt you in the breadbasket?

06:58.290 --> 06:59.314
No.

07:00.192 --> 07:02.456
I felt this way even afore the fight.

07:02.595 --> 07:04.495
Ever since I seen Alice.

07:06.565 --> 07:07.725
Adam?

07:08.067 --> 07:09.159
Yeah?

07:11.170 --> 07:13.365
Do you reckon I could be in love?

07:14.774 --> 07:18.870
Well, Pa used to say, love's kind of like
the measles. You only get it once.

07:19.278 --> 07:21.610
The older you are, the tougher it goes.

07:22.181 --> 07:25.048
Young fella like you
ought to get it kind of light.

07:33.159 --> 07:35.286
No, I guess not.

07:40.099 --> 07:43.034
I don't know as I can answer
your question, Gideon.

07:44.203 --> 07:47.866
But according to Milly, and she's had
a heap of book-learning:

07:48.541 --> 07:51.533
<i>When you're in love</i>

07:52.244 --> 07:55.236
<i>When you're in love</i>

07:56.982 --> 08:01.976
<i>There is no way on earth to hide it</i>

08:03.889 --> 08:06.881
<i>When you're in love</i>

08:07.760 --> 08:10.752
<i>Really in love</i>

08:12.231 --> 08:17.225
<i>You simply let your heart decide it</i>

08:19.839 --> 08:22.831
<i>How can you tell</i>

08:23.809 --> 08:27.575
<i>What's in its spell</i>

08:28.447 --> 08:33.441
<i>How can you tell until you've tried it</i>

08:35.888 --> 08:40.847
<i>Wait for that kiss you're certain of</i>

08:44.964 --> 08:50.368
<i>And let your heart decide</i>

08:50.736 --> 08:55.730
<i>When you're in love!</i>

09:05.951 --> 09:07.976
I guess I got the beginnings.

09:09.555 --> 09:12.786
But them townspeople will never
let us court them gals now.

09:13.959 --> 09:15.119
Not after today.

09:15.194 --> 09:16.786
Don't let it fret you.

09:16.996 --> 09:19.897
If you don't get this one,
there'll be another to come along.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.263
One woman's pretty much like the next.

09:22.635 --> 09:24.626
Come on, let's go feed the stock.

10:21.594 --> 10:26.588
<i>I'm a lonesome polecat</i>

10:30.302 --> 10:35.262
<i>Lonesome, sad, and blue</i>

10:38.544 --> 10:43.038
<i>'Cause I ain't got no</i>

10:44.617 --> 10:47.211
<i>Feminine polecat</i>

10:49.021 --> 10:53.151
<i>Vowing to be true</i>

11:03.902 --> 11:07.269
<i>Can't make no vows</i>

11:07.673 --> 11:11.234
<i>To a herd of cows</i>

11:18.851 --> 11:23.811
<i>I'm a mean old hound dog</i>

11:27.259 --> 11:33.220
<i>Baying at the moon</i>

11:35.434 --> 11:39.734
<i>'Cause I ain't got no</i>

11:41.540 --> 11:44.270
<i>Lady friend hound dog</i>

11:46.045 --> 11:50.141
<i>Here to hear my tune</i>

12:00.793 --> 12:04.126
<i>A man can't sleep</i>

12:04.663 --> 12:08.190
<i>When he sleeps with sheep</i>

12:16.041 --> 12:21.001
<i>I'm a little old hoot owl</i>

12:24.550 --> 12:29.249
<i>Hooting in the trees</i>

12:32.825 --> 12:37.159
<i>'Cause I ain't got no</i>

12:38.831 --> 12:41.595
<i>Little gal owl fowl</i>

12:43.402 --> 12:47.566
<i>Here to shoot the breeze</i>

12:58.350 --> 13:02.150
<i>Can't shoot no breeze</i>

13:02.221 --> 13:05.748
<i>With a bunch of trees</i>

13:48.667 --> 13:50.396
It is beautiful, isn't it?

13:50.502 --> 13:51.628
Not to me.

13:52.271 --> 13:53.966
I've seen too much of it.

13:54.907 --> 13:56.238
I'm getting out.

13:56.441 --> 13:57.772
Why, Benjamin!

13:57.843 --> 14:01.540
I'm not gonna spend another winter here,
snowed in for three, four months.

14:01.613 --> 14:05.014
What would we do without you?
We'd miss you so.

14:05.384 --> 14:08.581
There's plenty here
to take care of the farm without me.

14:21.633 --> 14:23.123
- Adam.
- Yeah?

14:24.937 --> 14:27.064
- Benjamin says he's leaving.
- What?

14:27.306 --> 14:29.536
He says it's the winter,
but I know it's not that.

14:29.608 --> 14:32.600
He's grieving for his girl.
They're all grieving for their girls.

14:32.678 --> 14:35.841
Why grieve for them?
They hardly saw them more than once.

14:36.748 --> 14:39.444
Once is all it takes if it's the right one.

14:39.718 --> 14:42.619
I had such dreams
about all of them living around...

14:43.255 --> 14:44.779
dozens of babies and children...

14:44.857 --> 14:47.985
visiting back and forth
at Christmas time and birthdays.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.028
If Benjamin goes, then another will go...

14:51.129 --> 14:52.289
and another.

14:54.499 --> 14:55.830
I'll talk to him.

15:13.552 --> 15:16.180
If you could just get a look at yourselves.

15:16.555 --> 15:19.854
You look like a bunch of lovesick
bull calves.

15:24.062 --> 15:27.225
If you're so sweet on those girls,
do something about it.

15:27.532 --> 15:28.829
Why don't you go marry them?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.664
Sure, just go marry them, as easy as that.

15:32.337 --> 15:34.931
They'd never let us marry them,
not in a thousand years.

15:35.006 --> 15:37.474
Then do like the Romans did
with the "sobbing women"...

15:37.542 --> 15:40.238
or, "Sabine women"
or whatever they called them.

15:40.345 --> 15:42.870
Those Romans were in the same fix
you're in.

15:42.948 --> 15:46.679
They was opening up new territory,
women were scarce, just like here.

15:47.519 --> 15:51.455
And there were these "sobbing women"
in town, so what did the Romans do?

15:51.790 --> 15:54.486
They went down there
and they carried them off.

15:55.026 --> 15:59.429
Now, if you can't do as good as a bunch
of old Romans, you're no brothers of mine.

15:59.831 --> 16:03.028
'Course, this being Oregon
and God-fearing territory...

16:03.335 --> 16:05.530
you'd have to capture
a parson along with them.

16:05.604 --> 16:06.866
Hey, them Romans...

16:06.938 --> 16:08.735
they the ones settled up north of here?

16:08.807 --> 16:12.573
No, this was in olden days.
I read about it here in Milly's book.

16:12.878 --> 16:13.970
Oh, a book.

16:14.112 --> 16:17.138
Why, this is history! This really happened.

16:17.315 --> 16:21.718
<i>Tell you about them sobbing women</i>
<i>Who lived in the Roman days</i>

16:22.220 --> 16:26.884
<i>It seems that they all went swimming</i>
<i>While their men was off to graze</i>

16:27.058 --> 16:31.961
<i>Well, a Roman troop was riding by</i>
<i>And saw them in their me-oh-my</i>

16:32.030 --> 16:36.490
<i>So they took them all back home to dry</i>
<i>Least, that's what Plutarch says</i>

16:36.601 --> 16:41.538
<i>Oh, yes, them a-women was sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing fit to be tied</i>

16:42.174 --> 16:46.634
<i>Every muscle was throbbing, throbbing</i>
<i>From that riotous ride</i>

16:47.078 --> 16:50.047
<i>Seems they cried and kissed</i>
<i>And kissed and cried</i>

16:50.115 --> 16:52.413
<i>All over that Roman countryside</i>

16:52.484 --> 16:56.887
<i>So don't forget that</i>
<i>When you're taking a bride</i>

16:57.489 --> 17:01.755
<i>Sobbing fit to be tied</i>
<i>From that riotous ride</i>

17:02.427 --> 17:05.487
- So, then what happened?
- Gather around, I'll tell you.

17:05.597 --> 17:09.863
<i>They never did return their plunder</i>
<i>The victor gets all the loot</i>

17:10.335 --> 17:14.532
<i>They carried them home, by thunder</i>
<i>To rotundas, small, but cute</i>

17:15.207 --> 17:20.008
<i>And you've never seen, so they tell me</i>
<i>Such downright domesticity</i>

17:20.145 --> 17:24.444
<i>With a Roman baby on each knee</i>
<i>Named Claudius and Brute</i>

17:24.648 --> 17:29.609
<i>Oh, yes, them a-women was sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing, passing them nights</i>

17:30.222 --> 17:33.919
<i>While the Romans was going out</i>
<i>Hobnobbing, starting up fights</i>

17:33.992 --> 17:34.981
Is that so?

17:35.060 --> 17:39.997
<i>They kept occupied by sewing lots</i>
<i>Of little old togas for them tots</i>

17:40.432 --> 17:44.664
<i>And saying, "Some day, womenfolks</i>
<i>Will have rights</i> <i>"</i>

17:45.504 --> 17:47.870
<i>- Passing all of their nights</i>
<i>- Just sewing</i>

17:47.939 --> 17:49.702
<i>While the Romans had fights</i>

17:49.774 --> 17:51.207
Hey, listen to this.

17:51.276 --> 17:56.009
<i>When the men folk went to fetch them</i>
<i>The women would not be fetched</i>

17:56.081 --> 18:00.017
<i>It seems when the Romans catch them</i>
<i>Their lady friends stay catched</i>

18:00.085 --> 18:01.109
<i>Right!</i>

18:01.186 --> 18:05.384
<i>Now, let this be because it's true</i>
<i>A lesson to the likes of you</i>

18:05.590 --> 18:09.754
<i>Rough them up like them there Romans do</i>
<i>Or else they'll think you're tetched</i>

18:10.061 --> 18:14.623
<i>Oh, yes, them women were sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing buckets of tears</i>

18:14.699 --> 18:15.859
<i>Mighty sad!</i>

18:16.001 --> 18:19.368
<i>On account of old dobbin, dobbin</i>
<i>Really rattled their ears</i>

18:19.504 --> 18:23.406
<i>And that ain't all</i>
<i>Oh, they acted angry and annoyed</i>

18:23.608 --> 18:26.008
<i>But secretly they was overjoyed</i>

18:26.111 --> 18:29.877
<i>You might recall that</i>
<i>When corralling your steers</i>

18:29.948 --> 18:32.348
<i>Oh, oh, oh, them poor little dears</i>

18:32.517 --> 18:35.008
What are you sitting there for?
Let's go get them.

18:35.086 --> 18:39.580
<i>Oh, yes, them a-women was sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing, weeping a ton</i>

18:40.792 --> 18:44.626
<i>Just remember what Robin, Robin</i>
<i>Robin Hood would have done</i>

18:45.664 --> 18:50.624
<i>We'll be just like them there merry men</i>
<i>And make them all merry once again</i>

18:51.036 --> 18:54.335
<i>And though they'll be a-sobbing</i>
<i>for a while</i>

18:54.406 --> 18:59.366
<i>Oh, yes, we're gonna make them</i>
<i>Sobbing women smile!</i>

19:14.693 --> 19:16.024
Whoa, there!

19:17.395 --> 19:19.363
Go get them. Be quiet about it.

19:20.031 --> 19:21.658
I'll wait for you here.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.371
Dan! Eph!

19:33.244 --> 19:34.802
Your two's in here.

19:37.549 --> 19:39.073
They're coming out.

19:39.184 --> 19:41.084
- Good night, Liza.
- Good night.

19:47.559 --> 19:49.026
Hey, you got mine.

19:53.131 --> 19:57.067
- How about my good night kiss, Sarah?
- Oh, Carl! You're so persistent.

19:57.168 --> 19:59.033
Be a sport. Just one kiss.

20:00.071 --> 20:02.835
Maybe just a little one. Close your eyes.

20:08.213 --> 20:09.578
Why, Carl!

20:10.382 --> 20:14.580
Frank! What are you doing? Put me down.

20:18.923 --> 20:20.515
That a boy, get them in.

20:22.394 --> 20:23.691
Come on, Frank.

20:25.497 --> 20:26.794
Where's Gideon?

20:31.936 --> 20:33.301
I hear the cat outside.

20:33.371 --> 20:35.271
I'll go, Mrs. Elcott.

20:36.307 --> 20:38.571
Poor Pansy, out on a night like this.

20:54.826 --> 20:56.418
Hurry it up, will you?

21:03.635 --> 21:05.330
Sounds like Pansy has the croup.

21:05.403 --> 21:07.098
I'll look out in back.

21:11.142 --> 21:13.269
It's all right, Alice, she's here.

21:27.058 --> 21:28.252
Dorcas!

21:30.795 --> 21:32.695
Pa! Pa, come quick!

21:34.265 --> 21:35.732
That a boy, Gideon.

21:50.949 --> 21:53.315
- What's keeping Benjamin?
- I don't know.

21:55.453 --> 21:56.818
Keep them quiet.

21:59.357 --> 22:00.483
Let's go!

22:01.392 --> 22:02.450
Come on!

22:08.500 --> 22:09.990
Hey, there, come on!

22:13.738 --> 22:15.933
- Sarah Kines! She's gone!
- So is Alice.

22:16.007 --> 22:18.441
- Ruth Jebson, too!
- Where's Dorcas?

22:18.576 --> 22:21.568
It was them Pontipees.
The whole seven of them jumped me!

22:21.646 --> 22:23.341
Come on, we'll get them.

23:14.999 --> 23:17.593
Make them stop that yelling.
We're coming to the Pass.

23:17.669 --> 23:20.695
Keep them quiet or we'll have
an avalanche down on us.

23:25.276 --> 23:27.767
All right. Here we go. Hold your breath.

23:43.094 --> 23:44.493
Keep her quiet!

23:50.602 --> 23:52.763
Hurry up, Adam. I can hear them coming.

24:22.367 --> 24:23.994
All right, let them go!

24:37.615 --> 24:38.912
There she goes!

26:01.833 --> 26:05.234
<i>On account of old dobbin, dobbin</i>
<i>Really rattled their ears</i>

26:08.339 --> 26:10.239
All right, boys, line them up.

26:10.308 --> 26:11.798
Milly! Milly!

26:13.644 --> 26:15.077
What have you done?

26:15.146 --> 26:18.115
- Milly, help us, please!
- Milly, we've been kidnapped.

26:18.182 --> 26:19.706
Make them take us back!

26:19.784 --> 26:22.252
You take these girls back at once,
do you hear?

26:22.320 --> 26:23.685
- Can't.
- There was an avalanche.

26:23.755 --> 26:26.451
I guess they'll just have to wait till spring.

26:27.725 --> 26:29.090
It was your idea, wasn't it?

26:29.160 --> 26:30.627
I'd say it was more yours.

26:30.695 --> 26:33.562
It all came out of that book
about them "sobbing women."

26:33.631 --> 26:35.724
What kind of men are you, anyway?

26:35.833 --> 26:38.233
Are you animals that you'd do
a thing like this?

26:38.302 --> 26:40.998
Swooping down like hawks,
carrying off poor innocents.

26:41.072 --> 26:43.370
They're just young boys in love, that's all.

26:43.441 --> 26:47.104
Didn't you tell me today you wanted them
all married with wives of their own?

26:47.178 --> 26:48.975
I want my mother!

26:50.181 --> 26:52.706
Please don't cry, Alice. I'm sorry, honest...

26:52.784 --> 26:55.582
but it was the only way
I could get to marry you.

26:56.554 --> 26:57.816
- Adam!
- What?

26:57.922 --> 26:59.913
We forgot to get the parson!

27:00.658 --> 27:04.059
Now, don't worry. Go on in the kitchen.
Nothing's going to happen.

27:04.128 --> 27:06.187
Cheer up. You've got them, haven't you?

27:06.264 --> 27:08.596
Everything's going to turn out all right.

27:08.666 --> 27:10.566
This house is for the girls...

27:10.668 --> 27:14.104
and you're not gonna set foot in it
as long as they're here.

27:14.172 --> 27:17.733
You're gonna eat and sleep in the barn
with the rest of the livestock.

27:17.809 --> 27:20.505
Now, get out of here. I'm ashamed of you.

27:21.312 --> 27:22.939
Go ahead, boys, go on.

27:24.715 --> 27:26.342
- Now, Milly...
- You, too!

27:26.684 --> 27:28.549
You're taking this too hard.

27:28.686 --> 27:32.383
It'll work out fine. Me and the boys'll
get a parson here some way.

27:32.790 --> 27:35.486
Do you think those girls
would marry them now?

27:36.594 --> 27:39.062
You think because you got a wife
so easily...

27:39.130 --> 27:43.328
'cause I didn't make you court me
and coax me, that that's all there is to it.

27:43.401 --> 27:45.801
I said yes to you
'cause I fell in love with you...

27:45.870 --> 27:48.464
the first time I saw you standing there.

27:48.739 --> 27:51.264
- I thought it was the same with you.
- Milly...

27:51.342 --> 27:53.776
You think a wife is just to cook and clean.

27:53.845 --> 27:56.746
You got no understanding,
you got no feelings.

27:57.215 --> 27:59.740
How could you do a thing like this?

28:00.418 --> 28:03.114
When I think of these poor girls,
sick with fright...

28:03.187 --> 28:05.587
and their families crazed with <i>worry...</i>

28:06.090 --> 28:08.251
I can't abide to look at you!

28:22.607 --> 28:26.566
This isn't exactly the way we'd planned
on spending the night, in a barn!

28:29.714 --> 28:32.182
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting out of here.

28:32.250 --> 28:34.684
Going up to the trapping cabin
to wait out the winter.

28:34.752 --> 28:37.721
You can't do it, Adam.
You can't stay up there alone.

28:37.788 --> 28:39.847
The cabin's got enough supplies
for six months.

28:39.924 --> 28:42.188
Don't go, Adam. It's us she's mad at.

28:43.494 --> 28:46.952
It's more than that.
It's something goes a lot deeper.

28:47.498 --> 28:48.692
Suppose you get sick...

28:48.766 --> 28:51.462
or break a leg or something,
up there all alone?

28:51.536 --> 28:53.970
And the wolves are mighty bad this year.

28:54.205 --> 28:58.164
The wolves will seem like good company
after what I've just been through.

29:06.317 --> 29:09.878
Nothing like a nice, hot cup of tea
when you're all tuckered out.

29:10.955 --> 29:13.651
Milly, it's me, Gideon.
I gotta speak to you.

29:14.325 --> 29:17.351
Oh, Milly! Please, Milly,
don't open the door!

29:18.362 --> 29:19.420
What is it?

29:19.497 --> 29:20.589
It's about Adam.

29:20.665 --> 29:24.192
He's going away up into the mountains,
up to the trapping cabin.

29:24.735 --> 29:26.362
Milly, can you hear me?

29:26.771 --> 29:27.795
I hear.

29:27.872 --> 29:30.500
If you'd just speak to him,
ask him not to go.

29:30.808 --> 29:32.139
Please, Milly.

29:34.178 --> 29:36.908
He's gotta learn
he can't treat people this way.

29:59.103 --> 30:00.934
Now, Eph, let's start here.

30:40.978 --> 30:43.003
You afraid of a little snowball?

30:50.087 --> 30:52.180
Snowballs with rocks in them!

30:52.490 --> 30:56.324
"Them poor little dears,
sobbing buckets of tears."

31:00.765 --> 31:03.029
"When the sign was given,
drawing their swords...

31:03.100 --> 31:04.761
"and falling with a great shout...

31:04.835 --> 31:07.599
"they ravished away
the daughters of the Sabine."

31:08.139 --> 31:09.231
Who is it?

31:11.075 --> 31:12.542
It's me, Caleb.

31:14.211 --> 31:15.576
What do you want?

31:16.113 --> 31:20.209
It's a mighty cold night, Milly.
I need an extra blanket.

31:22.987 --> 31:24.284
Go and get one.

31:33.464 --> 31:35.364
"It continues the custom to this day...

31:35.433 --> 31:38.869
"for the bride, not of herself,
to pass her husband's threshold...

31:38.936 --> 31:40.096
"but to be lifted over...

31:40.171 --> 31:43.572
"in memory that the Sabine women
were carried in by violence."

31:45.109 --> 31:46.440
Who is it?

31:47.078 --> 31:48.170
Benjamin.

31:49.714 --> 31:51.079
What do you want?

31:51.615 --> 31:55.551
My leg is feeling poorly.
I need some liniment.

31:58.155 --> 32:00.180
Go ahead, but be quick about it.

32:00.424 --> 32:01.721
Yes, Milly.

32:13.771 --> 32:17.002
"Some say, too, the custom
of parting the bride's hair...

32:17.074 --> 32:19.599
"with the head of a spear
was in token of..."

32:24.715 --> 32:26.273
I got me a stiff neck.

32:26.384 --> 32:27.817
That's enough of this nonsense.

32:27.885 --> 32:29.375
- We just wanted to...
- Look, Milly...

32:29.453 --> 32:33.617
Go on out to the barn, all of you.
Go to sleep, or I'll bolt the door on you.

32:44.301 --> 32:47.065
"...was in token of their marriages.

32:47.138 --> 32:50.938
"It began at first by wars
and acts of hostility...

32:51.242 --> 32:52.504
"and <i>then..."</i>

33:10.861 --> 33:13.591
Doesn't it do anything but snow up here?

33:13.697 --> 33:16.564
We've had a blizzard every day
for the past two months.

33:16.633 --> 33:19.397
I'm going crazy, shut up in this house!

33:19.770 --> 33:23.001
- Alice, why don't you read out loud to us?
- No.

33:23.073 --> 33:25.200
We've heard that book
three times already.

33:25.275 --> 33:28.005
Yes, go on. Read us
about the "sobbing women."

33:28.111 --> 33:30.545
- Please, Alice.
- I can't stand it again.

33:30.647 --> 33:33.172
Then go get the dress Milly promised,
and I'll fit you.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.684
What's the use
when there's no one to see it?

33:35.752 --> 33:36.844
No one?

33:37.120 --> 33:39.588
Well, I like that! We're no one.

33:39.956 --> 33:40.980
Where's Milly?

33:41.058 --> 33:43.253
Out in the barn, hunting eggs.

33:43.827 --> 33:47.422
I wish I could hunt eggs.
I love to hunt eggs.

33:48.432 --> 33:50.957
Which boy slept in this bed,
do you suppose?

33:52.869 --> 33:54.131
Dorcas Galen!

33:55.339 --> 33:58.001
What's the matter?
Didn't you ever think of that...

33:58.075 --> 34:00.669
that you're sleeping in one of their beds?

34:01.178 --> 34:04.011
Well, I certainly never thought
any such thing.

34:04.514 --> 34:08.382
Liza, Alice. Come away
from that window this minute.

34:09.186 --> 34:13.020
I think it's disgusting standing there
where they can see you.

34:13.456 --> 34:17.393
I notice that you peek out often enough
when you think no one's looking.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.292
- I never!
- I saw you!

34:19.529 --> 34:20.587
So did I!

34:20.664 --> 34:21.824
You take that back!

34:21.898 --> 34:23.592
You hear?

34:24.134 --> 34:26.728
How could you dare say a thing like that
about Martha?

34:26.803 --> 34:29.829
And what were you doing last night,
out at the woodpile?

34:29.906 --> 34:30.929
Oh, you!

34:31.007 --> 34:32.235
Girls! Girls!

34:39.916 --> 34:40.905
Girls!

34:42.485 --> 34:43.953
Stop it this minute!

34:44.688 --> 34:45.916
Dorcas! Alice!

34:45.989 --> 34:47.388
Alice, get up!

34:47.491 --> 34:51.154
Girls, please don't squabble.
Not now, not when I need you so much.

34:51.728 --> 34:54.561
You see, I'm counting on all of you
to help me.

34:55.732 --> 34:57.666
'Cause I'm gonna have a baby.

34:58.068 --> 35:00.332
Milly! Come sit down!

35:00.737 --> 35:02.204
Are you comfortable?

35:02.272 --> 35:04.502
You're not going to lift a finger
from now on.

35:04.574 --> 35:06.064
We'll take over everything.

35:06.143 --> 35:09.112
We'll do your chores,
cleaning, cooking, everything.

35:09.179 --> 35:11.079
No, really. That'd be silly.

35:11.148 --> 35:12.342
Where are you going?

35:12.416 --> 35:13.883
I have a few things to do.

35:13.950 --> 35:15.747
When's the baby coming?

35:15.952 --> 35:17.419
You have to be patient.

35:17.487 --> 35:18.954
But when?

35:19.523 --> 35:20.820
In the spring.

35:25.562 --> 35:27.894
- I wish it was me.
- Dorcas!

35:28.598 --> 35:30.998
I've always wanted to be a June bride...

35:31.468 --> 35:33.197
and have a baby right off.

35:34.070 --> 35:35.503
In the spring, maybe.

35:37.974 --> 35:41.569
<i>Oh, they say when you marry in June</i>

35:42.145 --> 35:46.206
<i>You're a bride all your life</i>

35:46.516 --> 35:50.179
<i>And the bridegroom who marries in June</i>

35:50.720 --> 35:54.622
<i>Gets a sweetheart for a wife</i>

35:54.991 --> 35:58.859
<i>Winter weddings can be gay</i>

35:59.229 --> 36:03.097
<i>Like a Christmas holiday</i>

36:03.567 --> 36:07.503
<i>But the June bride hears the song</i>

36:08.004 --> 36:11.906
<i>Of a spring that lasts all summer long</i>

36:12.309 --> 36:16.211
<i>By the light of the silvery moon</i>

36:16.780 --> 36:20.739
<i>Home you ride</i>
<i>Side by side</i>

36:21.117 --> 36:25.053
<i>With the echo of Mendelssohn's tune</i>

36:25.388 --> 36:29.324
<i>In your hearts</i>
<i>As you ride</i>

36:29.726 --> 36:33.628
<i>For they say when you marry in June</i>

36:34.097 --> 36:37.999
<i>You will always be a bride</i>

36:42.005 --> 36:46.965
<i>The day a maiden marries</i>
<i>Is the day she carries through the years</i>

36:47.844 --> 36:52.611
<i>The church is full of flowers</i>
<i>Bridal showers are passé</i>

36:53.483 --> 36:58.284
<i>The groom 's waiting at the altar</i>
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

36:58.488 --> 37:02.754
<i>They're each promising to love and obey</i>

37:03.894 --> 37:08.854
<i>Best man is celebrating</i>
<i>Every bridesmaid's waiting just to see</i>

37:09.766 --> 37:13.964
<i>Which one of them will catch</i>
<i>The wedding bouquet</i>

38:03.453 --> 38:08.413
<i>For they say when you marry in June</i>

38:09.593 --> 38:12.391
<i>You will always</i>

38:15.966 --> 38:20.926
<i>Always be a bride</i>

38:39.055 --> 38:42.855
<i>In November the snow starts to fly</i>

38:43.259 --> 38:46.660
<i>Piling up, ankle-high</i>

38:47.464 --> 38:51.161
<i>Come December it's up to your knees</i>

38:51.501 --> 38:55.301
<i>Still a bride's a bride-to-be</i>

38:55.739 --> 38:59.470
<i>January, higher still</i>

38:59.943 --> 39:03.606
<i>Through the parlor windowsill</i>

39:04.080 --> 39:07.516
<i>February finds a drift</i>

39:08.184 --> 39:11.984
<i>And a storm that seems never to lift</i>

39:12.789 --> 39:16.122
<i>March comes in like a lion, what else</i>

39:16.826 --> 39:20.660
<i>Still the snow never melts</i>

39:21.164 --> 39:24.964
<i>April showers will come, so they say</i>

39:25.435 --> 39:28.927
<i>But they don't and it's May</i>

39:29.673 --> 39:33.541
<i>You're about to forget the whole thing</i>

39:41.551 --> 39:46.488
<i>All at once, one day it's spring!</i>

40:22.125 --> 40:26.255
<i>Oh, the barnyard is busy</i>
<i>In a regular tizzy</i>

40:26.329 --> 40:30.663
<i>And the obvious reason</i>
<i>Is because of the season</i>

40:31.067 --> 40:34.969
<i>Ma Nature's lyrical</i>
<i>With her yearly miracle</i>

40:35.205 --> 40:38.197
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

40:38.808 --> 40:42.938
<i>All the hen-folk are hatching</i>
<i>While their menfolk are scratching</i>

40:43.046 --> 40:47.312
<i>To ensure the survival</i>
<i>Of each brand-new arrival</i>

40:47.717 --> 40:51.744
<i>Each nest is twittering</i>
<i>They're all baby-sittering</i>

40:51.988 --> 40:55.048
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

40:55.525 --> 40:59.393
<i>It's a beehive of budding son</i>
<i>And daughter life</i>

40:59.662 --> 41:03.428
<i>Every family has plans in view</i>

41:03.900 --> 41:07.734
<i>Even down in the brook</i>
<i>The underwater life</i>

41:08.071 --> 41:11.871
<i>Is forever blowing bubbles, too</i>

41:12.208 --> 41:16.269
<i>Every field wears a bonnet</i>
<i>With some spring daisies on it</i>

41:16.346 --> 41:20.840
<i>Even birds of a feather</i>
<i>Show their clothes off together</i>

41:21.017 --> 41:25.010
<i>Sun's getting shinery</i>
<i>To spotlight the finery</i>

41:25.255 --> 41:28.247
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

41:28.858 --> 41:32.453
<i>From his aerie the eagle</i>
<i>With his eagle eye</i>

41:32.996 --> 41:35.829
<i>Gazes down across his eagle beak</i>

41:37.167 --> 41:40.933
<i>And affixing his lady with a legal eye</i>

41:41.271 --> 41:44.570
<i>Screams, "Suppose we set</i>
<i>The date this week?"</i>

41:49.612 --> 41:53.742
<i>Yessiree, spring discloses</i>
<i>That it's all one supposes</i>

41:53.850 --> 41:58.082
<i>It's a real bed of roses</i>
<i>Wagging tails, rubbing noses</i>

41:58.488 --> 42:02.481
<i>Each day is Mother's Day</i>
<i>The next is some other's day</i>

42:02.559 --> 42:06.222
<i>When love is king</i>

42:06.329 --> 42:08.229
Frank, Dan, Ben, Caleb!

42:08.565 --> 42:09.554
Everybody!

42:09.632 --> 42:11.793
Milly's having her baby!

42:38.494 --> 42:40.655
Liza, Martha, Ruth, hurry!

42:40.897 --> 42:42.228
Hurry!

43:09.926 --> 43:11.120
I'm an uncle.

44:10.486 --> 44:12.351
Adam!

44:13.456 --> 44:14.980
Hey, Gideon!

44:15.825 --> 44:18.259
Couldn't stand the barn any longer?

44:18.861 --> 44:21.921
I've come to get you, Adam,
take you back with me.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.092
Yeah?

44:26.035 --> 44:29.596
Well, Milly has a baby.
It come day before yesterday.

44:32.508 --> 44:34.100
I don't believe it.

44:34.510 --> 44:37.638
- It's as true as I'm standing here.
- I don't believe it!

44:38.047 --> 44:40.345
Just one of her tricks to get me back.

44:40.683 --> 44:41.741
Tricks?

44:42.018 --> 44:45.579
You lived with Milly as man and wife,
and you don't know nothing about her.

44:45.655 --> 44:47.885
She's got pride and she's spunky.

44:48.291 --> 44:50.316
She'd never bring herself to ask you back.

44:50.393 --> 44:52.224
She'd be wasting her breath.

44:53.730 --> 44:55.163
I don't figure to go.

44:55.231 --> 44:59.224
Not even to see the baby?
Your own kin? Your own little girl?

44:59.902 --> 45:00.960
A girl?

45:02.005 --> 45:04.166
I might've known she'd have a girl.

45:05.375 --> 45:07.570
I'll be back when the Pass is open.

45:07.643 --> 45:10.237
And I'll stay away till the shooting's over.

45:10.313 --> 45:11.371
Adam...

45:13.082 --> 45:15.050
you're my eldest brother.

45:15.785 --> 45:18.549
I've always looked up to you,
tried to ape you...

45:19.655 --> 45:21.646
but today I'm ashamed for you.

45:23.192 --> 45:26.218
Now, I know you can lick me,
lick the tar out of me...

45:26.329 --> 45:30.288
but I wouldn't hold myself no kind
of man unless I showed you how I felt.

45:39.575 --> 45:40.667
Now, get!

45:55.124 --> 45:57.684
The Pass is open! The Pass is open!

45:57.860 --> 46:01.023
All able-bodied men gather
at the Meeting House.

46:03.900 --> 46:07.700
Bring your rifles, your knives,
your guns, axes, any kind of weapon!

46:09.205 --> 46:11.366
The Pass is open! The Pass is open!

46:12.141 --> 46:13.267
Are you ready, men?

46:13.342 --> 46:15.071
Yeah! Let's go!

46:39.735 --> 46:41.726
Well, what are you staring at?

46:42.071 --> 46:44.369
I told you I'd be back
when the Pass was open.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.464
The Pass?

46:45.541 --> 46:47.975
Milly! What are we going to do?

46:48.044 --> 46:50.638
Go upstairs, girls. Go on. Quickly.

46:53.749 --> 46:55.182
Let's get the guns.

46:57.487 --> 46:59.250
Tell them to hitch up the wagon.

46:59.322 --> 47:00.346
The wagon?

47:00.423 --> 47:03.324
Put plenty of blankets and straw in it.
Go ahead.

47:37.026 --> 47:38.550
What do you call her?

47:39.929 --> 47:42.022
I was thinking of some name like...

47:42.098 --> 47:44.123
Hannah or Hagar or Hephzibah.

47:45.134 --> 47:47.728
Picking up where your mother left off.

47:49.639 --> 47:50.765
Hannah.

47:55.678 --> 47:58.306
I got to thinking up there
in the mountains...

47:59.115 --> 48:00.912
thinking about the baby.

48:03.953 --> 48:07.650
About how I'd feel if somebody
came sneaking in and carried her off.

48:09.025 --> 48:11.220
I'd string him up the nearest tree...

48:11.294 --> 48:14.024
shoot him down
like I would a thieving fox.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.030
I thought about you, too,
while I was up there.

48:22.371 --> 48:25.204
It seemed like I couldn't get you
off of my mind.

48:28.544 --> 48:30.409
Milly, when you're in love...

48:31.614 --> 48:33.605
when you're really in <i>love...</i>

48:48.564 --> 48:50.259
The wagon's ready, Adam.

48:50.933 --> 48:52.025
All right.

48:52.768 --> 48:56.226
Now, get the girls. I want to take them
back to their families.

48:58.608 --> 48:59.700
Oh, Adam!

49:00.810 --> 49:02.778
Adam, you will be careful?

49:10.920 --> 49:12.911
We're not letting you
take them back, Adam.

49:12.989 --> 49:16.390
We've talked it over amongst us,
and we're all agreed. They ain't going.

49:16.459 --> 49:18.051
They're our girls now.

49:21.397 --> 49:25.026
I say I'm taking them back.
I'm still head of this family.

49:26.168 --> 49:28.193
Then I reckon you'll have to show me.

49:28.271 --> 49:29.499
Likewise.

49:32.241 --> 49:35.506
What do I have to do,
beat some sense in your dumb heads?

49:35.811 --> 49:38.405
Taking them back is the only way
you'll ever get them.

49:38.481 --> 49:39.880
The whole town's coming up here.

49:39.949 --> 49:42.179
Let them come! We'll fight them all.

49:43.286 --> 49:44.378
Sure.

49:44.854 --> 49:47.414
Sure you will. And who'll you be fighting?

49:47.590 --> 49:49.057
The girls' kinfolk.

49:49.358 --> 49:52.486
Someone's bound to get hurt,
a father, a brother, maybe.

49:54.297 --> 49:56.458
Think they'll marry you after that?

50:03.639 --> 50:04.901
Adam's right.

50:05.975 --> 50:07.340
I stand with Adam.

50:08.544 --> 50:10.375
Well, don't stand too close.

50:10.913 --> 50:13.746
Adam, the girls have gone.
They've run away!

50:14.216 --> 50:15.683
Go get them, get them back! Go on!

50:15.751 --> 50:17.912
- Ruth!
- Dorcas! Come back here!

50:17.987 --> 50:19.682
- Sarah, where are you?
- Ruth!

50:24.660 --> 50:27.288
Dorcas! Come back! You'll get hurt!

50:30.666 --> 50:33.328
Now, let's keep it quiet.
They can hear us from here.

50:33.402 --> 50:35.063
We'll creep up on them.

50:35.738 --> 50:36.762
Alice!

50:37.239 --> 50:38.604
Please, Alice!

50:38.674 --> 50:40.073
Martha, where are you?

50:40.142 --> 50:42.440
Come back, Martha. Don't run away.

50:44.847 --> 50:47.907
I'm not going back!
I want to stay with you!

50:47.983 --> 50:49.610
You've got to. It's the only way.

50:49.685 --> 50:50.913
I won't! No!

50:53.122 --> 50:54.521
It's Alice!

50:54.623 --> 50:55.988
Come on, Ruth!

51:04.133 --> 51:05.794
Hey, there they are!

51:13.342 --> 51:14.400
Let me go!

51:16.746 --> 51:17.770
No!

51:18.214 --> 51:19.306
Let me go!

51:20.950 --> 51:22.679
Don't! You'll hit Dorcas!

51:33.996 --> 51:35.020
Oh, no!

51:36.132 --> 51:37.156
Not that!

51:49.779 --> 51:51.269
Grab her dress, Ben!

51:52.681 --> 51:54.239
In the barn!

51:54.984 --> 51:56.246
Ruth!

52:09.565 --> 52:10.896
Why, Pa!

52:10.966 --> 52:12.194
Get up!

52:16.439 --> 52:17.599
Alice!

52:22.611 --> 52:23.669
Get off of her!

52:26.315 --> 52:28.306
What are you going to do to him?

52:28.384 --> 52:32.081
We're going to hang him with
the rest of them from the nearest tree.

52:35.791 --> 52:37.691
Just a minute!

52:37.760 --> 52:40.786
Before we go, there's one thing
we've got to know from our girls.

52:40.863 --> 52:42.353
Girls! Girls!

52:42.765 --> 52:45.063
Now, Reverend,
what is it you want to know?

52:45.134 --> 52:48.968
We're all fathers here, and we love you,
so don't be afraid to answer.

52:49.705 --> 52:52.606
A while back I heard a wee babe
crying in the house.

52:52.708 --> 52:53.868
Whose is it?

52:55.511 --> 52:57.809
Whose is it? Don't be afraid to tell.

53:00.583 --> 53:01.777
Mine!

53:06.622 --> 53:09.523
Do you, Alice, Ruth, Martha,
Liza, Sarah, Dorcas...

53:09.592 --> 53:12.459
take these men to be
your lawfully wedded husbands?

53:17.399 --> 53:18.627
We do.

53:18.701 --> 53:21.693
Do you, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel,
Ephraim, Frankincense, Gideon...

53:21.770 --> 53:24.671
take these girls to be
your lawfully wedded wives?

53:30.112 --> 53:31.170
We do.

53:31.413 --> 53:33.142
I now pronounce you men and wives.
