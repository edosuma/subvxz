00:01.930 --> 00:03.715
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:03.750 --> 00:07.050
I found a pair of women's
sunglasses in my dad's apartment.

00:07.085 --> 00:10.010
Returned them to my mom.
Turns out, they weren't hers.

00:10.045 --> 00:10.645
Oh, no.

00:10.680 --> 00:14.480
So, basically just told
her he was having an affair.

00:14.570 --> 00:15.575
What do you want from me?

00:15.610 --> 00:18.340
I want my son to have
what your daughter has.

00:18.375 --> 00:19.620
I want money.

00:20.460 --> 00:24.410
You have a lot of unresolved
stuff that you need to address.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.630
See you around?

00:28.170 --> 00:29.555
Sally brings home the bacon,

00:29.590 --> 00:32.009
and she's better at
making decisions than I am.

00:32.045 --> 00:33.450
Yeah, but you're hotter.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.930
I cheated on Harry last night.

00:36.965 --> 00:39.200
How did it happen? I-I mean, who?

00:39.280 --> 00:41.430
This guy from
work-- Dominic.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.355
You're up early.

00:53.390 --> 00:55.495
And not hungover,
thank you very much.

00:55.530 --> 00:58.480
Welcome to what we normal
people call Wednesday.

01:00.490 --> 01:02.130
You are kidding, right?

01:02.180 --> 01:04.390
Honestly, you should
consider it a compliment.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.495
So what's with the outfit?

01:09.530 --> 01:11.900
Seducing another
personal trainer, are we?

01:11.935 --> 01:13.685
No, I'm going hiking with Alex.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.150
- She invited me.
- Alex the lesbian?

01:16.330 --> 01:17.435
That's just offensive.

01:17.470 --> 01:18.545
Well, how is that offensive?

01:18.580 --> 01:20.550
She does identify as
a lesbian, doesn't she?

01:20.585 --> 01:22.435
Yeah, but it's not
her whole identity.

01:22.470 --> 01:25.260
I mean, she could just as
easily be referred to as

01:25.295 --> 01:27.760
Alex, the new best
friend of Josslyn Carver.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.240
- Yeah.
- What?

01:30.250 --> 01:33.470
No, it's just interesting.
You don't really have friends.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.010
Wow. What do you
call Karen and April?

01:36.045 --> 01:37.390
Savi's friends.

01:39.070 --> 01:39.995
Where is my sister anyway?

01:40.030 --> 01:42.090
We were supposed to
caravan to April's.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.150
Uh, she said she
had an early meeting.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.340
Congratulations, Savannah.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.390
You are officially pregnant.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.250
I...

02:09.860 --> 02:13.570
Sorry. It's just a lot
to take in right now.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.720
It's okay.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.920
Sometimes when a
couple's been trying

02:17.955 --> 02:19.845
as long as you and Harry have,

02:19.880 --> 02:22.610
when it finally happens,
it can be hard to believe.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.150
I'm writing you a prescription
for prenatal vitamins.

02:26.185 --> 02:30.030
We'll start with 600
micrograms of folic acid.

02:30.065 --> 02:31.535
You and Harry will need to fill out

02:31.570 --> 02:33.815
detailed medical histories
of both your families

02:33.850 --> 02:36.060
so we can determine if
there are any risk factors

02:36.095 --> 02:37.950
that may be inherited.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.390
So I'm "the most stunning
woman he's ever met,"

02:49.425 --> 02:51.412
but he's terrified of my package.

02:51.447 --> 02:53.365
Which sadly, is not a euphemism.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.500
The point is, he's not
interested in my drama.

02:55.510 --> 02:57.370
Then he's an idiot.

02:57.930 --> 03:00.710
Hmm. That's what Savi said, too.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.550
Earth to Savi. Come in, Savi.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.280
Uh, sorry.

03:06.570 --> 03:07.815
Just exhausted.

03:07.850 --> 03:10.170
- Did your meeting go okay this morning?
- What?

03:11.280 --> 03:13.080
Uh... Yeah.

03:13.115 --> 03:14.880
It was fine.

03:16.410 --> 03:19.500
Well, then I am officially
caffeinated enough

03:19.535 --> 03:21.742
to climb Everest.

03:21.777 --> 03:23.173
Or Runyon. Mwah.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.784
Later, ladies.

03:24.819 --> 03:26.360
- Have fun.
- Bye.

03:26.395 --> 03:27.670
Bye.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.930
I'm pregnant.

03:35.940 --> 03:37.190
Oh, my God!

03:37.225 --> 03:38.440
Oh, my God.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.750
Oh... My... God.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.450
- Yep.
- How pregnant?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.690
I mean, is it possible
the baby could be Harry's?

03:46.725 --> 03:48.540
Sure, it's possible,

03:48.990 --> 03:50.810
you know, and obviously,
that's what I'm hoping for,

03:50.845 --> 03:52.120
but...

03:52.440 --> 03:54.580
but Harry and I have
been trying for so long.

03:54.615 --> 03:55.635
It means nothing.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.825
Your doctor didn't
even recommend I.V.F.,

03:57.860 --> 04:00.055
so Harry's problem couldn't
have been that dire.

04:00.090 --> 04:02.750
Seriously, I've known couples
who have tried for years,

04:02.785 --> 04:04.955
went through rounds
of medical procedures,

04:04.990 --> 04:07.780
only to get drunk watching
some late night skinemax

04:07.815 --> 04:09.380
and
poof--baby.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.120
It was just one time with Dom.

04:12.130 --> 04:13.985
Exactly. Only one time.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.870
It's just as much of
a chance it's Harry's,

04:15.905 --> 04:17.904
- probably even more.
- Why more?

04:17.940 --> 04:20.800
Because it would be so much
better if it was Harry's.

04:20.834 --> 04:21.665
Exactly.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.650
Then you wouldn't have
to tell him anything.

04:23.890 --> 04:27.120
What are you talking
about? I have to tell him.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.725
No. No.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.610
You have to tell him now.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.690
I just feel so bad
for both of you guys.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.180
I love Harry.

04:35.580 --> 04:36.770
Me, too.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.340
Me, too.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.180
You all right?

04:43.640 --> 04:44.525
Do you need more water?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.675
I'm good. Just need
to catch my breath.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.995
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't
mean to push you.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.810
You just look-- you
look so athletic.

04:50.845 --> 04:52.555
It's actually more
of a metabolism thing

04:52.590 --> 04:55.590
than a being-in-shape thing.
Can we just stop for a second?

04:55.625 --> 04:57.600
- Sure.
- Oh, God.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.360
I like how you think this is funny.

05:03.395 --> 05:05.400
I'm literally dying on a rock.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.085
I'm sorry.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.380
It's just that I'm
used to being the one

05:08.390 --> 05:10.300
that has to beg Sally to slow down.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.780
Well, it's a good
thing Sally's not here.

05:11.815 --> 05:13.770
Oh, yeah. She wouldn't let us stop.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.920
What do you mean, she
wouldn't let us stop?

05:18.060 --> 05:19.260
Never mind.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.260
Somebody likes you.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.570
Eh. He's not my type.

05:26.605 --> 05:27.720
Really?

05:27.980 --> 05:29.340
Used to be mine.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.810
Shut your lady-loving lips.

05:33.845 --> 05:35.245
You slept with men?

05:35.280 --> 05:37.520
Oh, yeah. I hooked up with
boys all through high school.

05:37.555 --> 05:38.700
What happened?

05:38.860 --> 05:40.350
I met Emily,

05:40.360 --> 05:42.370
my freshman college roommate.

05:42.380 --> 05:43.930
And oh,

05:44.120 --> 05:46.110
something just clicked.

05:46.145 --> 05:46.575
What about you?

05:46.610 --> 05:48.890
You ever taken a drive down
the other side of the road?

05:48.925 --> 05:51.580
Yeah. But only with three
of us jammed in a car.

05:51.590 --> 05:52.465
And I was so drunk,

05:52.500 --> 05:55.970
I couldn't tell the stick
shift from the air bags.

05:56.005 --> 05:56.855
What?

05:56.890 --> 05:59.900
Oh, just threesomes. Definitely
never had a girlfriend.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.910
And actually, not that many
girls as friends either.

06:02.945 --> 06:03.922
Really?

06:03.957 --> 06:04.865
How come?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.940
I tend to sleep with
their boyfriends.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.910
You girls must've been
dragging your heels.

06:09.945 --> 06:11.910
- Oh, hi, Sally.
- Got your text.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.510
Took an early lunch to catch up.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.120
You don't do this much, do you?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.005
Come on, ladies.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.890
This is supposed to be exercise.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.650
Let's hustle.

06:25.230 --> 06:26.295
Pick it up.

06:26.330 --> 06:27.360
Come on.

06:37.110 --> 06:38.245
I'm sorry.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.760
I'm so sorry, Dom.

06:39.770 --> 06:40.405
It's my fault.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.600
Okay, you know what? Picking
up some papers off the floor

06:42.610 --> 06:45.400
doesn't make up for you
getting me kicked off a case.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.930
We have a call with opposing
counsel before trial tomorrow.

06:47.965 --> 06:49.530
My office, five minutes.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.870
Don't forget to mention Aspen.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.020
The appraisal. It's in my notes.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.900
What did you say these colors were?

07:02.910 --> 07:05.400
That's platinum and that's steel.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.400
But they're both gray.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.590
Both are of the gray variety, yes.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.370
So why not call them gray?

07:12.460 --> 07:14.770
Call it 20% off if you buy both.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.940
Bienvenue a maison par la
mer. How can I help you?

07:18.975 --> 07:20.740
I'm looking for miss April Malloy.

07:20.775 --> 07:21.535
That's me.

07:21.570 --> 07:22.535
My name is Bob Johnson.

07:22.570 --> 07:25.630
I'm an attorney representing
Miranda Nickleby.

07:26.080 --> 07:26.945
What's this?

07:26.980 --> 07:30.800
Proof of Paul Malloy's
paternity of Scott Nickleby.

07:31.340 --> 07:32.945
I never asked for proof.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.145
No, but we will have to provide it

07:35.180 --> 07:37.275
when we sue Paul for child support.

07:37.310 --> 07:39.760
Wait. What do you
mean, sue? Paul is dead.

07:39.795 --> 07:41.205
His estate is very much alive,

07:41.240 --> 07:44.340
and legally, must
provide for his offspring.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.545
If you refuse to pay,

07:46.580 --> 07:48.560
Ms. Nickleby will see you in court.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.570
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:36.730 --> 08:38.049
I'm gonna get a
refill at the fountain

08:38.085 --> 08:40.159
- before we hit the road.
- Okay.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.620
I appreciate you letting
me crash your hike.

08:46.370 --> 08:48.280
Yeah, I appreciate the
actual workout you gave me,

08:48.290 --> 08:50.545
Although oh, my legs might not.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.895
Yeah, well, I need
you in tip-top shape

08:52.930 --> 08:55.590
so you have the stamina
to keep showing us houses.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.890
Don't worry. I'm determined to
find you two a place to live.

08:58.925 --> 09:01.690
Yeah, well, if you
don't, that's okay, too.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.280
You're more than just a
real estate agent, Joss.

09:05.810 --> 09:06.990
What do you mean?

09:07.560 --> 09:08.820
You're our friend.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.930
Well, more Alex's friend
than mine, granted.

09:11.965 --> 09:14.227
But, uh, yeah, you
know, she's just been

09:14.262 --> 09:16.490
having a really
great time with you.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.250
And looking for houses is
giving her something to focus on,

09:19.285 --> 09:20.810
which is great.

09:21.010 --> 09:22.920
I feel like I'm
missing something here.

09:25.090 --> 09:27.035
It's just that she's
usually so bored.

09:27.070 --> 09:29.470
I mean, she teaches
three yoga classes a week,

09:29.505 --> 09:32.270
and I work 24/7. It's not ideal.

09:32.330 --> 09:35.000
But since we're both busy, I
feel like we're fighting less.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.440
So thank you.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.455
Yeah. I'm, uh, happy
to be a distraction.

09:41.490 --> 09:43.570
Especially because you
are actually in the market

09:43.605 --> 09:45.480
to purchase a home, aren't you?

09:46.010 --> 09:48.290
I am if you find
me one worth buying.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.130
Hey. I got you a
water from the cart.

09:53.165 --> 09:54.490
Thanks, ali-bear.

09:55.410 --> 09:57.050
Mm. Thank you.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.450
I take it you've met my attorney.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.680
I was going to call you.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.010
I called you six times.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.820
I'm still processing.

10:17.090 --> 10:18.250
Look...

10:19.190 --> 10:21.350
I didn't want to bring a
lawyer into this, but I had to.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.180
I can't stay in
California indefinitely,

10:23.215 --> 10:25.840
and I'm not leaving with nothing.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.640
Let's meet today.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.250
Yeah, I'm busy today.

10:32.990 --> 10:34.130
I'll drive up to L.A. tomorrow.

10:34.140 --> 10:35.850
I'll let you know
when's good for me.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.960
My only option is to sell
off a share of the store.

10:42.995 --> 10:44.917
Or I-I guess I could
put the house up

10:44.952 --> 10:46.771
and downsize into
something smaller--

10:46.806 --> 10:48.590
Okay. Pull the brake
on the crazy train.

10:48.625 --> 10:49.565
You're not selling your house

10:49.600 --> 10:51.170
and you're not
giving Miranda a dime.

10:51.205 --> 10:52.195
I don't think that's realistic.

10:52.230 --> 10:53.580
Her lawyer told me
that if I didn't--

10:53.615 --> 10:56.150
Breathe before you pass out.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.380
Good. Another one.

11:00.330 --> 11:01.520
Do it.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.190
There is no proof that those
paternity papers are even real.

11:06.225 --> 11:08.310
Oh, no. They're real.
I called the company.

11:08.345 --> 11:09.875
Paul is his father.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.545
This isn't a scam, Savi.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.540
Everything Miranda has told
me so far has checked out.

11:13.575 --> 11:14.805
She's telling the truth.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.270
Well, she may not be a
liar, but she is a bitch.

11:17.305 --> 11:18.580
I couldn't agree more.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.480
Okay, unfortunately, bitches
still have legal rights

11:21.515 --> 11:23.615
and child support is a real thing.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.820
Maybe there's some number
that'll satisfy Miranda

11:25.855 --> 11:27.500
and not bankrupt me.

11:27.510 --> 11:29.805
No. If it's not done
within a legal framework,

11:29.840 --> 11:31.880
you're gonna be writing checks
for the rest of your life.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.790
It's really better to
handle this in court.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.575
I can't.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.700
There's no way I could keep
something like that from Lucy.

11:36.735 --> 11:37.950
Then don't.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.810
She'll be okay.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.150
Look, I know you're trying
to protect your daughter,

11:43.160 --> 11:45.880
but at a certain point,
you have to ask yourself--

11:46.090 --> 11:47.750
at what cost?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.220
I just don't want to put
Lucy through a big court case

11:53.255 --> 11:56.807
if I can't win, and that
lawyer sounded so confident.

11:56.842 --> 12:00.360
Well, you are clearly not
aware of my mad skills.

12:00.395 --> 12:01.877
If I can prove entrapment,

12:01.912 --> 12:03.325
they have no case at all.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.930
Did Miranda know Paul was married

12:04.965 --> 12:06.440
before she slept with him?

12:06.475 --> 12:07.820
I have no idea.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.030
We never talked about it. We
never talked about anything.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.690
Maybe you should.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.020
Oh, my lord.
Is that--

12:22.660 --> 12:25.140
How do you deal with
seeing him every day?

12:25.175 --> 12:26.420
I try not to.

12:27.930 --> 12:30.460
Kind of hard when you
work in a glass office.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.090
Have you decided what
you're gonna tell Harry?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.810
Not yet.

13:02.220 --> 13:04.340
Lucy, when did you make this?

13:05.700 --> 13:07.015
At school yesterday.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.025
You didn't have a new frame,

13:08.060 --> 13:10.505
so I thought it might help
you get out of your funk.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.000
I'm not in a funk. I just got
a lot going on at the store.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.810
It's more than that.
It's because of daddy.

13:18.020 --> 13:18.895
His birthday is next week,

13:18.930 --> 13:21.350
and you always get sad
around his birthday.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.690
I guess I do.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.190
That's why you're not
talking about him as much.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.420
Because you think I'm gonna
be sad remembering him.

13:35.590 --> 13:36.750
Will you?

13:36.770 --> 13:38.025
No.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.895
I like remembering
the things about him,

13:39.930 --> 13:42.350
like the way we used to blow
out the candles together.

13:42.900 --> 13:43.805
Together?

13:43.840 --> 13:47.100
Okay, when he'd let me blow
out all of his candles for him.

13:47.135 --> 13:49.737
And give you presents at his party.

13:49.772 --> 13:52.340
And wish me a very
happy unbirthday.

13:52.940 --> 13:55.070
He was a great dad, huh?

13:56.060 --> 13:57.320
The best.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.170
Yeah.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.490
For the record,

14:06.620 --> 14:09.220
he thought you were
a pretty great kid.

14:29.170 --> 14:30.385
Dr. Kim.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.950
Uh, you left your wallet in my car.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.160
Oh, man. Thank you. Uh,
been on the phone all morning

14:37.195 --> 14:38.610
canceling credit cards.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.730
You should've called me.
I would've come pick it up.

14:40.765 --> 14:42.890
You're on my way to the office.

14:43.130 --> 14:46.010
Besides your licence
is suspended, isn't it?

14:46.740 --> 14:48.415
I feel like I owe
you an explanation.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.055
- You don't.
- I don't want you to

14:50.090 --> 14:52.910
think I was out partying
like some idiot frat boy.

14:52.945 --> 14:54.430
The truth is, I was out celebrating

14:54.465 --> 14:56.205
and had one too many.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.760
- What were you celebrating?
- Dropping out of school.

14:58.795 --> 15:01.275
I have officially
withdrawn from Brown.

15:01.310 --> 15:04.960
Really? I thought you were
looking forward to going back.

15:04.995 --> 15:07.057
Just 'cause it was something to do,

15:07.092 --> 15:09.120
not because I was
excited or anything.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.530
But something must have happened,

15:11.540 --> 15:14.700
something that made you
decide to suddenly drop out.

15:14.735 --> 15:17.070
Yeah. My dad told me to.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.090
What are you talking about?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.340
It's easier if I just show you.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.940
Uh, I didn't know you
were bringing Scottie.

15:39.975 --> 15:41.740
My sister had to
take an extra shift.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.390
I hope it's not a problem.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.490
Why don't we just sit down outside?

15:47.830 --> 15:50.530
Sure. Oh, can I get a coffee first?

15:52.210 --> 15:53.520
Of course.

15:54.940 --> 15:56.180
Cappuccino would be great.

15:56.190 --> 15:57.580
Extra foam.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.490
Is there any way you can
squeeze me in today? It's urgent.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.610
Uh, I can make that work.

16:08.630 --> 16:11.160
Great. I'll be there. Thank you.

16:12.570 --> 16:15.380
Question for my sister whose
job it is to sway a jury.

16:15.415 --> 16:17.242
Did you get another
speeding ticket?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.035
No. I need to
convince Alex to leave

16:19.070 --> 16:21.440
her controlling,
disrespectful girlfriend--

16:21.475 --> 16:22.955
Except I need to say it nicer.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.795
Did she ask you to comment
on her relationship?

16:25.830 --> 16:28.600
No, but I need to say
something. It's toxic.

16:28.610 --> 16:29.945
Well, if it's not solicited,

16:29.980 --> 16:32.060
I would keep your
opinion to yourself.

16:32.095 --> 16:34.072
It's not an opinion. It's a fact.

16:34.107 --> 16:35.718
Alex is miserable with Sally.

16:35.753 --> 16:37.330
Therefore, they should break up.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.640
Pretty sure you're oversimplifying.

16:39.675 --> 16:40.855
It's very simple.

16:40.890 --> 16:43.860
When a person is in a
relationship that isn't great,

16:43.895 --> 16:45.202
they get out of it.

16:45.237 --> 16:46.510
No, that's what you do.

16:46.710 --> 16:48.730
Lots of relationships
hit rough patches,

16:48.765 --> 16:50.750
and people actually
work through them.

16:50.785 --> 16:51.585
Why are you getting so upset?

16:51.620 --> 16:54.060
Because you're about to give
potentially devastating advice,

16:54.095 --> 16:55.775
which is why nobody
tells you anything.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.290
What are you talking about?
Who's not telling me stuff?

16:58.320 --> 16:58.975
Forget it.

16:59.010 --> 17:00.380
Are you mad at me?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.900
Make you lunch before
you head to court?

17:03.760 --> 17:06.119
I would love that, but I
actually have a meeting first,

17:06.155 --> 17:07.630
which I'm running late for.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.700
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.950
Did I walk into the
middle of something?

17:16.250 --> 17:17.204
It's just drama.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.500
It's what happens when
two ladies live together

17:18.535 --> 17:20.800
and their cycles
haven't synced up yet.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.194
Let that be the last time

17:22.230 --> 17:24.319
you ever talk to
me about your cycle.

17:24.355 --> 17:26.410
Agreed. In exchange
for an espresso?

17:28.520 --> 17:29.710
Step away.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.520
Oh, there. There you go.

17:34.530 --> 17:35.855
Sweetie, take that one.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.690
Don't lose mater, though.
He's your favorite.

17:37.725 --> 17:39.190
Thank you, mommy.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.750
So how do you want to do this?

17:47.930 --> 17:50.290
By answering a few questions first.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.920
Shoot.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.490
Did you know Paul was married?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.580
When I checked him into
the hotel I used to work at,

17:58.615 --> 18:00.920
I did notice that he was
wearing a wedding band.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.562
I also noticed that
he wasn't wearing it

18:02.597 --> 18:04.170
when he took me to
dinner that night.

18:06.470 --> 18:08.740
And how long were you
two having an affair?

18:09.470 --> 18:12.190
At first, we would just get
together whenever he came to town.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.780
I don't even know that I
would call it an affair.

18:14.815 --> 18:16.010
I would.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.050
Uh, anyway,

18:19.550 --> 18:23.070
after a year, we start talking
about getting it serious.

18:23.690 --> 18:25.250
And then I got pregnant,

18:26.100 --> 18:27.295
and that's when he told me

18:27.330 --> 18:30.500
that he had made up
his mind to do it.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.950
To do what?

18:33.830 --> 18:35.160
To leave you.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.120
Let me just get
these in the fridge.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.990
Sure. Sure.

18:56.310 --> 18:58.790
So how is your mother holding up?

18:59.420 --> 19:02.020
Oh, you mean since I
inadvertently told her

19:02.055 --> 19:04.110
my dad was having an affair?

19:04.630 --> 19:05.575
Not too bad.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.800
She's gone from grief to anger.

19:07.835 --> 19:09.185
Maybe it's a good thing.

19:09.220 --> 19:13.050
Anyway, this is what
I wanted to show you.

19:25.810 --> 19:26.765
A camera?

19:26.800 --> 19:29.100
Not just a camera.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.400
A 1923 Eastman Kodak.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.150
My dad got it for me.

19:33.190 --> 19:35.375
His secretary sent it
over about a week ago.

19:35.410 --> 19:37.940
I guess he'd been tracking
it down before he died.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.495
And I had no idea he even
knew I was into photography

19:43.530 --> 19:47.510
until I moved in here and saw
my work hanging on his walls.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.920
You took all these?

19:55.790 --> 19:57.140
I love them.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.135
But I still don't understand

20:00.170 --> 20:02.980
what this has to do with
you dropping out of school.

20:03.790 --> 20:05.310
This was my dad's way of telling me

20:05.345 --> 20:07.302
to--to--to drop
the econ major

20:07.337 --> 20:09.260
and focus on what I actually love.

20:10.330 --> 20:12.350
Maybe. Or maybe he's
telling you to have a hobby.

20:12.385 --> 20:13.680
I don't think so.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.920
Read it.

20:29.650 --> 20:32.860
"It is only passion that
makes life worth living.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.690
"I found my passion
too late in life,

20:36.510 --> 20:37.770
"but when I did,

20:38.580 --> 20:40.860
"I pursued it with my whole being.

20:43.230 --> 20:45.990
"When you find yours,
you must do the same.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.400
Don't hold on to anything
that doesn't bring you joy."

20:53.250 --> 20:55.380
Uh, are you okay?

21:01.840 --> 21:03.810
Can I use your restroom?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.610
Yeah.

21:17.740 --> 21:19.255
Oh. Oh. Excuse me.

21:19.290 --> 21:22.290
Uh, you said the doctor
would only be another minute?

21:22.325 --> 21:24.407
-Yep.
-Yeah, that was 30 minutes ago.

21:24.442 --> 21:26.490
Patients who make
same-day appointments

21:26.525 --> 21:28.250
sometimes have to wait.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.930
Until the second coming?

21:36.630 --> 21:38.995
Shouldn't you be on your
way to court right now?

21:39.030 --> 21:41.195
Are you still up to speed
on the Sullivan case?

21:41.230 --> 21:43.360
I spent the last year
prepping for it with you.

21:43.395 --> 21:45.617
I'm aware. Is that a yes?

21:45.652 --> 21:47.840
- Yes.
- Get downtown.

21:49.650 --> 21:51.670
You can't make it to the
start of the biggest trial

21:51.705 --> 21:52.695
you've ever been a part of?

21:52.730 --> 21:55.500
Something came up,
and I can't put it off.

21:55.730 --> 21:56.535
Does Mitchell know?

21:56.570 --> 21:59.370
He will. Can you be there or not?

21:59.405 --> 22:01.380
Oh, I'll be there.

22:01.650 --> 22:02.960
Thank you.

22:11.070 --> 22:14.800
Scottie, get down from there.
Don't make mama ask again.

22:16.290 --> 22:18.455
Um, what was I saying? Oh, right.

22:18.490 --> 22:22.660
I said that we had driven down
to the Keys for the weekend.

22:22.950 --> 22:26.130
Paul had planned this
whole romantic getaway thing

22:26.630 --> 22:28.270
because of the baby.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.710
He left early that morning to
go on a deep-sea fishing trip,

22:31.745 --> 22:35.100
but he never came
back to the hotel.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.810
He was two hours late for dinner.

22:39.620 --> 22:43.060
And I-I figured he
was partying in town,

22:43.070 --> 22:45.805
and he just--he wasn't
picking up his phone,

22:45.840 --> 22:49.070
and I was all dressed
up with nowhere to go,

22:49.105 --> 22:52.265
planning on marching
into every bar in old town

22:52.300 --> 22:54.770
until I found him and I could
publicly rip him a new one.

22:54.805 --> 22:57.845
And then I saw a report on the news

22:57.880 --> 23:02.820
that someone had gone
missing on a fishing tour.

23:03.790 --> 23:05.870
Fallen overboard and...

23:06.600 --> 23:08.110
That was Paul.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.000
You knew before I did.

23:13.610 --> 23:15.620
I got a 6:00 a.m. wake-up call

23:15.655 --> 23:17.630
from the Key West chief of police.

23:17.770 --> 23:20.790
I didn't know what
to do after that.

23:20.825 --> 23:23.810
I was five months
pregnant and alone,

23:23.845 --> 23:25.160
and then...

23:25.820 --> 23:26.715
When Scottie came,

23:26.750 --> 23:28.860
and I held him for the
first time in my arms,

23:28.895 --> 23:32.077
I... I decided to make it work.

23:32.112 --> 23:35.260
I had to, and--and
I have, but...

23:35.270 --> 23:36.580
It's hard.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.580
You don't know hard.

23:39.615 --> 23:41.075
I'm a single mom, too.

23:41.110 --> 23:43.400
My situation is no
different than yours.

23:43.435 --> 23:44.780
Really?

23:45.180 --> 23:46.825
Six months ago, I lost my job,

23:46.860 --> 23:48.305
and thanks to this economy,

23:48.340 --> 23:49.715
I can't get another one.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.790
My friends, my family--I
have asked them all for help,

23:52.825 --> 23:53.917
but everyone is tapped.

23:53.952 --> 23:54.975
Everyone except me, huh?

23:55.010 --> 23:57.390
Do you think I want to be here?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.635
This is humiliating.

23:59.670 --> 24:02.010
But this isn't about me
anymore. It's about Scottie.

24:02.045 --> 24:03.720
He needs your help.

24:04.730 --> 24:05.815
Mommy!

24:05.850 --> 24:08.260
Oh, my God. Honey, what happened?

24:08.295 --> 24:09.965
Honey, are you okay?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.080
Tell me, where does it
hurt? Where does it hurt?

24:19.460 --> 24:21.165
Can you help, please? My son fell.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.870
I think he might've broken his arm.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.050
Oh. I need assistance. Grab
the gurney for the child.

24:26.730 --> 24:27.300
Excuse me, ma'am.

24:27.310 --> 24:29.005
I'm gonna need some
information from you first

24:29.040 --> 24:30.700
starting with your
I.D. and insurance card.

24:30.710 --> 24:31.780
I-I don't have insurance.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.085
Then I need an I.D.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.440
And a whole mess of
additional forms filled out.

24:34.475 --> 24:36.347
I re... I really want to
be with my son right now.

24:36.382 --> 24:38.220
I'll take care of the
bill. Just go with Scottie.

24:38.255 --> 24:38.940
Are you sure?

24:38.975 --> 24:40.500
Yes. Go.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.250
You cook?

25:05.780 --> 25:07.340
Not as well as my dad did.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.160
I'm trying...

25:09.920 --> 25:11.560
one of his recipes.

25:11.595 --> 25:12.760
Here.

25:13.670 --> 25:15.010
Sit.

25:16.010 --> 25:18.290
Thank you, but I really can't.

25:18.770 --> 25:20.680
You have somewhere else to be.

25:22.550 --> 25:25.800
No, actually, uh, I don't.

25:26.430 --> 25:28.910
So stay.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.700
Do you wanna talk about it?

25:48.310 --> 25:49.215
I'm okay.

25:49.250 --> 25:52.270
I didn't mean to get
so emotional before.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.610
I'm sorry about that.

25:53.645 --> 25:54.305
Don't be.

25:54.340 --> 25:56.605
He was your patient
for a long time.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.780
I forget you guys had
your own relationship.

26:00.740 --> 26:02.510
Yes, we did.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.400
Come on. You know
you love Young Jeezy.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.520
No.

26:22.430 --> 26:24.490
So what's for dinner?

26:36.020 --> 26:37.430
Joss!

26:37.465 --> 26:38.840
Hey. Hi!

26:40.350 --> 26:42.280
This is fancy. I'm
glad I wore a bra.

26:42.290 --> 26:45.500
Thank you so much for coming.
Sally flaked on me again,

26:45.535 --> 26:48.170
and I just hate going
to these things alone.

26:48.260 --> 26:49.895
Does she flake on you a lot?

26:49.930 --> 26:51.495
Mm, it was my fault, really.

26:51.530 --> 26:54.690
I should never R.S.V.P. "Yes"
to anything on a weekday.

26:56.450 --> 26:59.930
So who is this? Some swanky
designer friend of yours?

26:59.965 --> 27:02.255
A friend of a friend, actually.

27:02.290 --> 27:05.410
To be honest, I hardly
know anybody here.

27:05.445 --> 27:07.250
But I love Liza's jewelry.

27:07.285 --> 27:08.847
Which one is Liza?

27:08.882 --> 27:10.410
Uh, over there.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.140
And the blonde next to her is

27:13.175 --> 27:15.932
her girlfriend/muse/sponsor.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.690
Oh. This is a lesbian party.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.660
Well, not exclusively,

27:21.695 --> 27:24.150
but, um, mostly.

27:24.185 --> 27:24.685
Sweet.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.430
I've never been the only
straight one in a room before.

27:27.465 --> 27:29.350
I feel like I have a
dirty little secret.

27:29.385 --> 27:30.565
Well, from what you've told me,

27:30.600 --> 27:32.890
it sounds like you've
got lots of 'em.

27:36.210 --> 27:37.610
Mrs. Davis.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.450
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27:41.890 --> 27:44.440
I see congratulations are in order.

27:44.670 --> 27:46.840
You looking for a new O.B.?

27:46.875 --> 27:48.650
Uh, maybe.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.530
Right now, I'm just more interested

27:51.565 --> 27:54.230
in getting some information on...

27:54.420 --> 27:56.550
paternity tests.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.300
Okay.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.700
Confirmation of paternity

28:03.710 --> 28:05.980
is typically done via amniocentesis

28:06.015 --> 28:07.352
in the second trimester.

28:07.387 --> 28:08.655
It's safest for the fetus

28:08.690 --> 28:12.180
when performed between
16 and 20 weeks.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.435
Wait. 16 weeks?

28:14.470 --> 28:16.000
I'll be showing by then, right?

28:16.035 --> 28:17.135
Not necessarily.

28:17.170 --> 28:20.270
Every body reacts
differently to pregnancy.

28:20.305 --> 28:23.070
There's no way to test any sooner?

28:23.200 --> 28:24.900
Oh, there's a
recently developed test

28:24.910 --> 28:27.600
that only requires a D.N.A.
sample from the mother

28:27.635 --> 28:28.955
and the potential father.

28:28.990 --> 28:31.495
Because it's noninvasive,
it can be done right away,

28:31.530 --> 28:34.990
but it's quite expensive, and
insurance doesn't cover it.

28:35.025 --> 28:37.127
And how long before I
find out the results?

28:37.162 --> 28:39.961
Two or three weeks
once we collect samples.

28:39.996 --> 28:42.760
And by samples, you
mean like a blood test?

28:42.795 --> 28:43.935
Ideally.

28:43.970 --> 28:46.645
But there are different
ways to determine D.N.A.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.550
If the potential father is
unwilling to offer up a sample.

28:49.585 --> 28:51.075
Like a hairbrush?

28:51.110 --> 28:52.865
Hair, skin, fingernails.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.300
Sometimes even a
toothbrush is enough.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.380
Do a lot of people do this?

28:59.990 --> 29:02.000
You'd be surprised.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.735
Alex, right? It's Cassandra.

29:15.770 --> 29:17.980
I've seen you somewhere
before, haven't I?

29:18.015 --> 29:20.300
At another one of Liza's parties.

29:20.335 --> 29:21.930
Maybe.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.470
I don't know. I don't--
I don't remember. Sorry.

29:24.505 --> 29:25.515
I do.

29:25.550 --> 29:29.900
I could never forget
those beautiful brown eyes.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.270
Mm. Here you go.

29:32.380 --> 29:35.535
Ah. Oh. I don't think I
can handle another martini.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.800
- Mm. Don't worry. I'll finish what you can't.
- Thanks.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.360
Thanks for keeping
my girlfriend company.

29:45.370 --> 29:46.805
Girlfriend?

29:46.840 --> 29:48.185
Somehow I doubt that.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.280
See? I leave you
alone for a second?

29:51.315 --> 29:53.680
You're such a flirt, Ali-bear.

29:53.910 --> 29:55.250
Come here.

29:56.410 --> 29:57.960
Don't. Don't do that.

29:57.995 --> 29:59.430
I'm sorry.

29:59.780 --> 30:01.380
Alex, wait.

30:25.830 --> 30:27.295
How's he doing?

30:27.330 --> 30:29.830
It's a hairline fracture.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.875
You really didn't
have to wait for us.

30:32.910 --> 30:37.050
Well, I just wanted to see
if you guys needed anything.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.640
No, we'll be okay.

30:40.050 --> 30:41.860
I'm gonna let him rest
here a little longer

30:41.870 --> 30:45.470
and then head back to my sister's.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.190
You sure?

30:47.730 --> 30:49.020
Yeah.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.350
Thank you.

30:54.850 --> 30:57.500
You're not the person
I expected you to be.

30:59.230 --> 31:00.730
What did you expect?

31:00.765 --> 31:02.270
I don't know.

31:03.390 --> 31:06.150
I just--this whole thing
would be a lot easier

31:06.185 --> 31:08.130
if you weren't a good person...

31:09.700 --> 31:11.270
But you are.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.870
Take care of your little man.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.010
This must be strange for you.

31:33.045 --> 31:34.205
How so?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.970
Well, having dinner with someone
you know these personal things about,

31:36.980 --> 31:39.395
but from someone
else's perspective.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.790
I don't know that
much about you, Sam.

31:41.825 --> 31:44.150
Then why have you
been so nice to me?

31:46.450 --> 31:48.730
I feel like you need someone.

31:49.940 --> 31:51.930
I could say the same about you.

31:55.200 --> 31:59.650
Uh, I feel like we--we,
uh, we need water glasses.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.710
I'll
grab--grab them.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.930
Where are they?

32:10.830 --> 32:12.390
To your left.

32:23.630 --> 32:25.000
I got it.

32:34.330 --> 32:35.660
There you go.

32:43.770 --> 32:45.210
It's done.

32:55.020 --> 32:56.780
You were right. I
haven't made a friend

32:56.815 --> 32:57.895
that's lasted longer than a week

32:57.930 --> 33:01.170
since Lindsay Warner
in elementary school.

33:02.770 --> 33:04.055
What's this?

33:04.090 --> 33:07.910
It's an I'm-sorry-you-lost-your-friend-three-cheese
grilled cheese.

33:07.970 --> 33:10.770
That's the saddest
sounding sandwich ever.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.280
What kind of cheese is that?

33:15.380 --> 33:16.745
You wanna talk about what happened?

33:16.780 --> 33:19.255
No. It's stupid. I
fake-made out with Alex,

33:19.290 --> 33:21.730
because I thought
that's what she wanted,

33:21.765 --> 33:23.330
and I was wrong, obviously,

33:23.365 --> 33:24.570
and she got all mad.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.965
What does "fake" making out mean?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.650
I kissed her, but I
didn't mean to kiss her.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.355
How do you accidentally
kiss a lesbian?

33:31.390 --> 33:32.995
Are you trying to
make me feel worse?

33:33.030 --> 33:35.180
No, but if you ever bothered
to think before you act--

33:35.215 --> 33:36.680
Then I wouldn't be me.

33:38.630 --> 33:41.660
Did you put prosciutto
in this? It's super yummy.

33:43.540 --> 33:45.570
- Is that--
- Yeah.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.250
Alex.

33:52.310 --> 33:54.600
Sally and I broke up.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.680
We just had the
most horrible fight,

33:56.715 --> 33:59.450
and I-I, um,

33:59.650 --> 34:01.230
I didn't--I didn't
know where else to go.

34:01.265 --> 34:01.725
Sorry.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.240
No. No. It's okay. It's okay.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.080
Sweetheart, it's okay.

34:11.760 --> 34:15.060
Yet another personal issue
has kept you from court today?

34:15.230 --> 34:17.090
Do you want to make partner?

34:17.125 --> 34:18.949
Yes. I-I do.
Of--of course I do.

34:18.985 --> 34:21.340
I'm so sorry, Ron.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.380
She's out. You're in for
the remainder of the trial.

34:25.415 --> 34:27.440
Don't screw this up.

34:30.030 --> 34:31.565
That didn't look good.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.010
I can assure you it sounded
a lot worse than it looked.

34:34.190 --> 34:36.360
Well, thank you for that.

34:36.790 --> 34:38.245
For what?

34:38.280 --> 34:39.985
Getting me back on
the Sullivan trial.

34:40.020 --> 34:42.360
I'm sorry you had to fake
a disappearing act to do it.

34:42.395 --> 34:44.070
Yeah.

34:44.310 --> 34:45.620
You're welcome.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.880
Okay. Am I missing something?

34:47.889 --> 34:49.135
Not that it matters,

34:49.170 --> 34:52.074
but I didn't blow off
court to do you a solid,

34:52.110 --> 34:54.940
just like I didn't purposefully
get you thrown off the case.

34:54.975 --> 34:56.295
Then I stand corrected.

34:56.330 --> 34:57.840
I just thought that after
what happened between us,

34:57.875 --> 34:59.640
that you just didn't
want to be around me.

34:59.675 --> 35:02.110
I don't want to be around you.

35:02.950 --> 35:05.250
Savi, talk to me.

35:05.285 --> 35:06.640
No.

35:27.910 --> 35:30.430
I'm sorry, but there's an
emergency at the office.

35:30.465 --> 35:31.717
I have to go.

35:31.752 --> 35:32.970
Seriously?

35:33.030 --> 35:35.170
It's a patient in trouble.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.410
Hazard of the profession.

35:38.140 --> 35:40.330
Yeah. Sure.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.220
Another time.

35:44.580 --> 35:46.050
Good night, Sam.

35:46.085 --> 35:47.380
Good night.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.470
Oh, your jacket.

36:09.770 --> 36:11.190
Thank you.

36:16.410 --> 36:17.735
What are you doing?

36:17.770 --> 36:19.450
Uh, I'm sorry.
I thought--

36:19.485 --> 36:20.770
No.

36:22.150 --> 36:23.800
Come on. You brought
over the wallet

36:23.835 --> 36:25.057
when you could've just sent it.

36:25.092 --> 36:26.245
You were about to stay for dinner.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.200
Sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

36:30.220 --> 36:31.200
We had a moment.

36:31.235 --> 36:32.850
No, Sam,

36:33.090 --> 36:35.420
We did not have a moment.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.390
Good-bye.

37:17.740 --> 37:19.750
Whose are those, mommy?

37:20.430 --> 37:22.990
Someone left them
at the shop, sweetie.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.110
Can I have them?

37:26.220 --> 37:28.150
No, you can't.

37:46.110 --> 37:48.020
Good morning!

37:52.230 --> 37:52.975
Thank you.

37:53.010 --> 37:57.130
Mm, well, thank Savi and Harry.

37:57.950 --> 37:59.770
Thank you for letting
me stay here last night.

37:59.805 --> 38:01.765
Oh, no problem. You
can stay anytime.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.880
Be careful. You might regret
saying that when I'm here

38:03.890 --> 38:06.640
for a whole month because
I can't find an apartment.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.315
Honey, I'm in real estate.

38:08.350 --> 38:10.585
If you want a top
floor, rent-controlled

38:10.620 --> 38:12.820
view of the hills,
I'll find it for you.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.375
So I might sound like a
jackass for asking this,

38:19.410 --> 38:21.680
but the fight didn't have
anything to do with me, did it?

38:21.715 --> 38:23.810
It had everything to do with you.

38:23.845 --> 38:25.095
It was just a kiss.

38:25.130 --> 38:26.645
Do I need to explain
to Sally that I--

38:26.680 --> 38:29.700
It wasn't the kiss. It
was everything. Everything.

38:29.735 --> 38:31.405
The more you and I hung out,

38:31.440 --> 38:33.110
the more I saw my
relationship through your eyes.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.995
No. My eyes are stupid.

38:35.030 --> 38:37.405
You should definitely
not listen to my eyes.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.780
You think that I let
Sally walk all over me,

38:39.815 --> 38:41.600
and you know what? You're right,

38:41.940 --> 38:44.750
And I don't want to
be that person anymore.

38:45.710 --> 38:47.710
So maybe you should talk to her.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.900
I'm sure we will.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.880
You're a good friend, Joss.

38:57.690 --> 38:59.040
Really?

38:59.420 --> 39:00.770
Yep.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.460
Sorry I couldn't get
this to you yesterday.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.255
Oh, no problem.

39:07.290 --> 39:08.665
Thank you for your services.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.460
I doubt I'll be
requiring them again.

39:10.470 --> 39:12.660
So it all worked
out? She bought it?

39:12.695 --> 39:14.090
You did a great job.

39:14.470 --> 39:16.855
Tell that to my agent.

39:16.890 --> 39:18.575
I still don't get why you
couldn't use a real lawyer.

39:18.610 --> 39:21.460
- I mean, if your son really is--
- Lawyers ask too many questions,

39:21.495 --> 39:23.600
which is why you should stop now.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.200
Fair enough. Catch you later.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.750
What?

39:55.610 --> 39:57.900
Do you think you'll always love me?

39:58.380 --> 40:00.360
That was the agreement.

40:00.395 --> 40:02.340
I'm serious, Harry.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.830
Of course I'll always love you.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.690
Why?

40:13.840 --> 40:17.230
Because I love you so much.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.100
All the mistakes I make,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.870
even the little ones like
when I burn your coffee

40:27.920 --> 40:29.620
and the big ones,

40:29.900 --> 40:33.150
like how I acted after our fight...

40:35.280 --> 40:38.720
I make them because
I love you so deeply.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.325
Oh, come on.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.770
We're past all that
now, aren't we, love?

40:43.805 --> 40:45.780
Yeah.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.680
But you know me. Sometimes I
have a hard time letting go.

40:50.490 --> 40:53.110
Well, I kind of
like that about you.

40:53.145 --> 40:55.730
It means you'll never let go of me.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.260
Now that's the way to
start the day right.
