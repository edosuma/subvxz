Everyone was trying to

you were a nobody.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.243
You were a nerd.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.829
If you wanted to
get into the gang,

04:06.830 --> 04:10.541
you had to crawl after and
suck up to all the gang girls.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.710

- Danny gave it to me, 18 karat.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.757
- How many does that make now?

16:48.758 --> 16:49.758
- Nine.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.054
- These Bruce's?
- Yeah.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.185
Sue.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.146
Far out.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.690
(Light music)

17:05.691 --> 17:08.528
(Waves crashing)

18:44.290 --> 18:45.915
- You ain't watching.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.542
- I was.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.543
- [Bruce] I caught this
really good wave, I looked up

18:48.544 --> 18:49.544
and you weren't watching.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.712
- I was, I saw you.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.297
- Yeah, she was.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.759
- Where's me towel?
- Here, here's your towel.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
- Want a smoke?

18:56.761 --> 18:58.720
- [Bruce] Yeah,
where's me smokes?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.556
- Did you see that big one?
- Yeah.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.600
- I've got them, here they are.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.393
- Geez, I'm hungry.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.646
- I'll get you something,
what do you want?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.397
- Chiko roll.
- Give us a match.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.565
- And chocolate thick shake.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.566
- Okay.
- No thanks.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.817
- Anyone else want anything?

19:12.818 --> 19:13.653
- No thanks.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.695
- Oh yeah, get us two deep
sears and a can of coke, thanks.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.530
- Cheeseburger.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.615
- [Debbie] Girls never ate
in front of their boyfriends.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.450
It was unlady like
to open your mouth

19:20.451 --> 19:22.869
and shove something in it.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.622
We're also busting
to go to the lavatory,

19:25.623 --> 19:28.291
but that was too rude for girls.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.877
Our stomachs rumbled
and our bladder's burst.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.712
- Oh yeah, and
don't forget the sauce

19:32.713 --> 19:36.883
and don't take any bites of
it on the way back, alright.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.178
- Isn't this great?
- Yeah.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.185
(Whistling)

19:51.482 --> 19:53.191
- [Teacher] Hip and in.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.193
Hip and in.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.195
One, two, shoulder.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.197
Spin and reach.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.074
One and stronger.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.951
One and hip.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.621
One and two and spin and reach.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.997
- Did you hear about Cheryl?

20:07.998 --> 20:08.874
- No, what?

20:08.874 --> 20:09.834
- Danny dropped her.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.210
- Dead set? Why?

20:13.212 --> 20:16.923
- He caught her
two-timing with strach.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.968
- She's going to get herself
a bad reputation, you know.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.219
- That's for sure.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.265
- [Teacher] Up and hit,
hit and back, back.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.225
- Did you hear I dropped Danny?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.226
- Yeah?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.729
- It was only a nine karat
ring he gave me anyway.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.231
- [Teacher] Now come
fonnard two, three, four

20:33.232 --> 20:36.235
and back two,
three, four and turn.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.404
- Danny asked me to the
drive-in Friday night.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.822
- Dead set? You going?

20:40.823 --> 20:42.907
- Of course, you're going
with Bruce aren't you?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.409
- [Teacher] Turn and reach.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.245
- Mm, I think Bruce and
me root on Friday night.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.247
- You're going
together aren't you?

20:49.248 --> 20:53.084
- Yeah, I don't know
what to do about it.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.252
- Bruce'll know.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.880
- You reckon?
- Of course he will.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.341
- Debra and Susan,
please pay attention,

20:59.425 --> 21:01.551
you might be dancing
as well as Kim.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.261
Now with your permission
we'll start again.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.846
- About all she can do.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.849
- [Teacher] Okay,
back to the top.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.143
- Vicki?
- What?

21:10.561 --> 21:14.397
- What's it like?
- What's what like?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.065
- You know, screwing?

21:16.066 --> 21:18.276
- I don't know.
- Yes you do.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.278
- It's okay.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.280
- What do I do?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.783
- Nothing, just lie there.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.701
- Oh god, I'm begging shit now.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.703
- Shh.

21:28.746 --> 21:29.955
- Four.
- Four.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.718
(Dramatic music)

21:58.442 --> 22:01.195
- You're beautiful, mate.
- Yeah.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.741
- So hot in there.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.743
- [Danny] Don't complain,
you got in for nothing.

22:08.744 --> 22:13.666
- [Mrs. Barker] Processing
complex, please board the bus.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.755
She breathes into
the establishment

22:20.756 --> 22:24.342
of the dairy in 1939, with a
brotherhood growing concern

22:24.343 --> 22:26.469
about the health
of it's members.

22:26.470 --> 22:30.348
Such disease as malaria,
hepatitis and anaphylactic shock

22:30.349 --> 22:33.351
which is the result in life
and death allergy produce

22:33.352 --> 22:37.982
penicillin brought common
about traditional drinkers.

22:40.526 --> 22:44.028
The dairy brings our
lifestyle up to date.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.531
Each carefully selected
blood cow is accompanied

22:46.532 --> 22:49.659
to the village by an
elaborate medical vile.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.161
Before the blood is
test and cartooned,

22:52.162 --> 22:54.372
each Turner is placed
on a stringent diet

22:54.373 --> 22:57.166
and subjected to scutular
interlogical tests

22:57.167 --> 22:59.545
for any blood contaminates.

23:01.005 --> 23:04.716
We assure that all packaged
blood is absolutely free from -

23:04.717 --> 23:05.634

23:05.635 --> 23:07.635
(Muffled speaking)

23:07.636 --> 23:09.137
- [Glenn] Just a hot dog.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.098
- [Danny] Sounds good
and some French fries.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.182
You want anything?

23:13.183 --> 23:16.228
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, a fanta.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.233
- [Mrs. Barker] Attention
please, attention please.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.906
Would all letters a, j, I
and q, please enter the bed.

23:29.575 --> 23:30.950
- [Kate] Who are those people?

23:30.951 --> 23:32.702
- [Mrs. Barker] They're our
visitors for the festival.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.412
They come here
from all over the world.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.039
- [Dr. Fraser] Tonight's
the opening ceremony

23:36.040 --> 23:37.415
and I'll be at the seating.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.833
You're more than
welcome to come.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.713
- [Mrs. Barker] Yes,
you must join us, Kate.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.259
(Grunting)

23:48.260 --> 23:49.261
- Christ.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.072
Move down.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.785
- [Vicki] Hot dog, Danny?

24:19.249 --> 24:20.125
- Shit.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.126
- Sorry.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.804
We're finished?

24:33.889 --> 24:36.724
That was a courting ceremony
in sylvania heights,

24:36.725 --> 24:38.476
where I grew up.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.896
At least I was doing
something on Saturday nights.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.900
(Video game music)

24:52.241 --> 24:54.242
There's something wrong with me.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.284
I couldn't do it.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.786
He couldn't get it in.

24:56.787 --> 25:00.123
- Don't worry about
it, it'll be alright.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.666
- What about Danny, how's he?

25:01.667 --> 25:02.959
- He was really nice.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.670
He didn't even want
to get in the back.

25:05.671 --> 25:06.922
- You're lucky.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.758
Don't tell anyone
I'm still a virgin.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.926
- [Sue] Of course not.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.386
- Promise.
- Promise.

25:13.387 --> 25:16.515
(Video game music)

25:22.187 --> 25:25.356
(Upbeat music)

25:25.357 --> 25:28.693
- Oh, come on Debra, help
Carol with the table.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.653
- Mom, I just
want to finish this.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.281
- [Mrs. Vickers] Now, I'm
waiting to serve up dinner.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.949
- If I don't do my
homework, I get into trouble

25:34.950 --> 25:37.535
and if I do do my homework
I get into trouble.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.079
- Don't be cheeky, please miss.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.539
- I can't seem
to do a thing right

25:41.540 --> 25:43.374
around this place lately.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.544
- Don't speak to
your mother like that.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.003
- Shit.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.255
- [Mrs. Vickers] That'll be 20
cents off your pocket money.

25:49.256 --> 25:52.050
- Everybody's
always picking on me.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.052
(Crying)

25:54.053 --> 25:57.805
- Oh, come on now,
there's no need for this.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.224
- Everybody hates me.
- Yeah.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.392
- Carol.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.727
- Everybody doesn't hate you.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.979
Your father and I
love you very much.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.565
And your friends at
fellowship like you.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.691
- They're all nerds.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.360
- Oh come on, that's not nice.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.821
- Can't do a thing right.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.864
(Phone ringing)

26:14.865 --> 26:15.866
|'|| get it!

26:22.998 --> 26:23.998
Hello.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.584
- Good day.
- Hello, Bruce.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.127
How's the surf?

26:28.128 --> 26:30.338
- Oh, it was okay,
bit of a roost about.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.382
Hang on a second,
Benny hill's back on.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.469
- [Mrs. Vickers] Debra,
your dinner's on the table.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.847
(Laughing)

26:41.016 --> 26:42.767
Debra, did you hear me?

26:42.768 --> 26:43.894
- Coming mom.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.230
Bruce? Bruce?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.440
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.275
(Laughing)

26:51.276 --> 26:53.236
Oh god, you should've
seen Benny hill.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.278
He's just so funny.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.322
- Bruce, I have to go.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.615
- Debra!

26:57.616 --> 26:59.492
- My mother's cracking a mental.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.036
- Yeah, right on.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.222
(Engine revving)

27:30.357 --> 27:33.318
(Tires squealing)

27:40.534 --> 27:41.659
Good day.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.661
- Hello.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.667
- Mom, this is Bruce.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.835
- How do you do, Bruce?

27:50.836 --> 27:53.838
- Good day, Mrs. Vickers.
- Doing some gardening?

27:53.839 --> 27:55.089
My olds are right
into gardening too.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.425
They got heaps
of flowers and stuff.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.677
- That's nice.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.720
- Come meet dad.

28:00.721 --> 28:04.348
- Yeah right on, check
you later, Mrs. Vickers.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.977
(Light music)

28:12.983 --> 28:14.276
- [Debbie] Dad.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.160
- Christ, your old
man must be loaded.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.246
- I think he's upstairs.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.010
- Geez, this is a
fucking mansion, Deb.

28:42.012 --> 28:43.013
- Dad?

28:46.516 --> 28:48.267
Dad, this is Bruce.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.897
- How you go,
Mr. Vickers, getting heaps?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.733
Top furniture you
got here, Mrs. Vickers.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.569
Bet it cost heaps, eh?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.739
Would you mind if I
bludge one of those.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.158
- Oh, not at all.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.038
- Bruce works for his father.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.623
- What does your
father do, Bruce?

29:10.624 --> 29:12.917
- He's a brickie.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.169
- He's training you, is he?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.295
- He's trying.

29:16.296 --> 29:20.549
Not too bloody interested
but, rather surf.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.593
It's pretty hard
work being a brickie.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.762
My dad fu...

29:25.180 --> 29:27.807
Hurt his back pretty bad
carrying bricks a while ago.

29:27.808 --> 29:31.103
He's been on and
off work every since.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.564
- Would you like some more tea?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.316
- No, thanks

29:37.317 --> 29:38.609
- mom.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.946
- No, I think I better
get back to my gardening.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.239
Will you excuse me, Bruce.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.366
- Yeah, sure.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.662
- More tea, dad?

29:49.663 --> 29:51.581
- No thank you, Debra.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.803
(Whistling)

30:13.395 --> 30:15.813
- Nice curtains, Bruce.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.398
- Yeah, my mom made them.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.233
See you around, Mrs. Vickers.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.526
- Yes, goodbye, Bruce.
- Yeah, goodbye.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.403
- [Debbie] Bye, mom.

30:21.404 --> 30:22.695
- Don't be too late home, Debra.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.530
- [Debbie] No, mom.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.490
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, dad.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.369
(Engine revving)

30:32.289 --> 30:33.831
- I don't know what
she sees in him.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.458
- He's got nothing
going for him.

30:35.459 --> 30:38.377
- I reckon he's an idiot.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.089
(Upbeat music)

31:00.692 --> 31:03.612
(Loud chattering)

31:04.529 --> 31:07.406
- [Garry] We had to cut these
pigs eyes up in bio yesterday.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.283
- Hey, Deb.
- Yeah.

31:08.284 --> 31:09.742
- Did you hear we had to
cut up these pigs eyes up

31:09.743 --> 31:10.868
in biology yesterday.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.036
- Oh, yuck

31:12.037 --> 31:13.412
- [garry] Strach collected a
whole pile of them aftennards

31:13.413 --> 31:15.164
and put them in
berkhoff's sandwiches.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.415
- [Debbie] Ew, did he eat them?

31:16.416 --> 31:18.542
- Yeah, he ate the whole
lot on his playground duty.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.505
We just about cracked up.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.464
- You coming.
- What for?

31:23.465 --> 31:24.507
- Screw.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.425
- We were desperate romantics.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.760
Is that all you're
interested in?

31:27.761 --> 31:29.053
We were always trying
to get the boys to say

31:29.054 --> 31:30.763
what they said on TV.

31:30.764 --> 31:31.681
- Come on.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.724
- [Debbie] It's
you, you're the one.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.310
Kiss me, kiss me darling.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.314
And when we get older,
they'll just be you and me.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.899
Forever, together.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.486
- You have the vas?

31:45.487 --> 31:47.363
Vaseline, you got any?

31:47.364 --> 31:48.614
- No.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.077
- There's probably
some in the bathroom.

31:55.205 --> 31:58.916

32:36.580 --> 32:40.749

32:40.750 --> 32:43.752
j“ how long you

32:43.753 --> 32:46.214
- [TV] Too gutless to drive.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.803
- What are you watching?

32:52.804 --> 32:56.015
- Um, it's been really
good, hasn't it, trace.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.141
- [Trace] Oh yeah, really good.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.852
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tubular.

32:59.853 --> 33:00.978
- I know what you mean.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.980
I'm off to my pottery
class, I'll see you later.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.023
- Okay, bye, mom.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.316
- See you later.
- Bye.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.234
- Goodbye.
- Night night.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.068
- See you later.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.654
(Chattering)

33:15.619 --> 33:18.288
(Upbeat music)

33:21.583 --> 33:23.167
- [Debbie] It's hurting.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.003
- [Bruce] Keep still.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.672
- [Debbie] Ow.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.549
(Grunting)

33:29.550 --> 33:32.176
It's no use, it's too big.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.470
- [Bruce] Shit.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.191
- It has been brought to my
attention that some children

33:47.192 --> 33:51.695
are smoking on the bus on
the way to and from school.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.323
I can't stress strongly
enough was a disgusting,

33:54.324 --> 33:57.326
dirty habit this is,
especially when practiced

33:57.327 --> 33:59.828
by children in school uniform.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.039
If it is brought to
my attention again,

34:02.040 --> 34:04.542
I will take the names
of all those concerned

34:04.543 --> 34:06.544
and not only will
I deal with them,

34:06.545 --> 34:10.382
but I will send notes
home to their parents.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.219
- Freda, you slackass moll.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.346
- Bloody hag.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.056
- Hey, Cheryl.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.351
- Bruce is dropping
Debbie, okay?

34:22.351 --> 34:24.853
- Yeah?
- Too tight, tell her.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.524
- Uh, Debbie.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.693
Uh, you're dropped.

34:30.694 --> 34:31.570
- What?

34:31.571 --> 34:33.404
- Strach reckons that Bruce
told him that you're dropped.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.862
- One weak act.

34:34.864 --> 34:38.199
- Yeah, and she was
really good to him too.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.411
- What a turd.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.954
- I got Tequila.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.746
It's been there for heaps,
dad doesn't like it.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.958
Did you have a glass of
milk before you came?

34:45.958 --> 34:46.835
- No.

34:46.835 --> 34:51.255
- Sue, I told you, it puts
a lining on your stomach.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.799
I had two big glasses of
caramel flavor and Brandy.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.801
- Oh, yuck.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.387
- Okay, got to drink
it down really fast.

34:58.388 --> 34:59.597
You won't taste it.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.974
One, two, three.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.522
(Coughing)

35:08.982 --> 35:10.524
Awful.

35:10.525 --> 35:14.279
- Ah, yuck, what do
they put in this thing?

35:15.572 --> 35:17.907
(Coughing)

35:21.745 --> 35:22.996
- Here.
- Thanks.

35:24.998 --> 35:27.541
Come on, this time we'll
just take a sip, okay.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.959
Come on, sue.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.295
Ready, set, go.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.674
- Oh, yuck.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.802
- See, doesn't taste
as bad, does it?

35:38.803 --> 35:39.804
- No.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.475
- Come on, let's go outside.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.604
(Laughing)

35:48.605 --> 35:50.147
I feel awful funny.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.941
- [Sue] Yeah, me too.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.613
- [Debbie] Must
be the air, come on.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.866
- Hey, sue.
- Yeah.

36:00.867 --> 36:01.743
- [Debbie] Let's
have one more sip

36:01.744 --> 36:02.951
and then we'll go
to the party, okay.

36:02.952 --> 36:03.952
- [Sue] Okay.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.331
(Laughing)

36:10.585 --> 36:13.171
(Rock music)

36:18.927 --> 36:19.928
Hi, Vicki.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.012
Hi, garry. Hi, trace.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.181
- [Deb] Hi, Tracy.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.517
One, two, three.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.356
- Hey, what are you two up to?

36:33.733 --> 36:37.194
Tequila, pretty strong stuff
for a little girl, isn't it?

36:37.195 --> 36:39.071
- Who asked you, dickhead?

36:39.072 --> 36:41.031
- Quit drinking this.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.659
Get her some milk, seagull.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.202
Where'd you get
this from anyway?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.870
- Give it back, it's mine.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.372
- Don't grab.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.250
- Give it back to her.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.212
- Well, drink it.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.464
It'll settle your stomach.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.550
- Shit. Hey, leave it.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.512
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.681
- Stupid moll.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.525
(Chattering)

37:25.660 --> 37:26.661
- Shit.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.083
Quick, trace's old's home.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.002
(Frantic chattering)

37:35.003 --> 37:36.671
- Sue, sue come on.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.969
(Rock music)

38:05.533 --> 38:07.911
- [Man] I think they're ill.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.751
- Someone put
something in our drinks.

38:15.752 --> 38:16.795
Honest, mom.

38:28.723 --> 38:32.560
- Pay attention, it's
your future, not mine.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.792
If you look carefully,
you'll notice...

38:56.793 --> 38:58.752
What have you got there?

38:58.753 --> 39:00.337
- Nothing, sir.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.048
- Then you won't
mind if I read it.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.344
Well, come on,
girlie, bring it here.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.195
- A rooting machine.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.489
Now, what exactly
does that mean?

39:27.490 --> 39:29.867
- It doesn't mean anything, sir.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.953
- And who is this Danny?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.540
- Danny Dixon.

39:36.666 --> 39:37.667
- I see.

39:38.543 --> 39:43.088
- And am I to assume that
you are contemplating having

39:43.089 --> 39:46.550
sexual intercourse with
that long haired young lad?

39:46.551 --> 39:47.926
- No, sir.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.553
- I don't understand you, Susan.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.097
Hanging around
with that surfy gang.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.141
You got a good IQ, you
come from a good home.

39:54.142 --> 39:58.980
You'll never get anywhere
going out with boys like that.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.150
I'm keeping this note in my safe

40:03.151 --> 40:04.234
and if you step
out of line again,

40:04.235 --> 40:07.195
I'll have to inform
your parents.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.072
Do you understand?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.073
- Yes, sir.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.703
- I know you'll do the right
thing eventually, Susan.

40:14.704 --> 40:18.666
You'll settle down,
marry and raise a family.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.086
That's all.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.271
(Jazz music)

40:41.189 --> 40:43.733
(Chattering)

40:59.457 --> 41:01.166
- Hey, do you want to score?

41:01.167 --> 41:02.918
- [Danny] Oh, smack.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.629
- Not with those guys, man,
they sell nothing butjunk.

41:05.630 --> 41:09.591
- [Debbie] If you are pimple,
a migrate or just plain ugly

41:09.592 --> 41:12.010
you couldn't get a boyfriend.

41:12.011 --> 41:15.597
If you couldn't get a boyfriend
there were two options,

41:15.598 --> 41:19.017
you could be a prude or a moll.

41:19.018 --> 41:19.894
Being a prude was too boring.

41:19.895 --> 41:21.478
- [Strach] Hey, Freda.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.539
- [Debbie] If you're a moll,

41:22.563 --> 41:23.897
at least people
knew who you were.

41:23.898 --> 41:24.774
- How you going?

41:24.775 --> 41:25.899
- [Debbie] Like Freda cummings.

41:25.900 --> 41:26.901
- Alright.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.988
- Have a good night, Freda.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.115
- What you doing?

41:33.116 --> 41:37.787
- Just came down to get my
brother a birthday present.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.332
Well, I -

41:42.333 --> 41:45.502
- hang on, where you going?
- Home.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.920
- We'll give you a lift.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.506
We're going right past
there, aren't we, Bruce?

41:49.507 --> 41:50.508
- Yeah.

41:51.676 --> 41:52.676
- I don't know.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.928
- It's all under control.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.346
No worries.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.348
Come on.

42:01.644 --> 42:02.937
See yous later.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.648
- It's looks like
it's going to rain.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.150
Want to get in the club?

42:08.151 --> 42:10.527
(Chattering)

42:10.528 --> 42:12.822
(Laughing)

42:13.781 --> 42:15.699
("Girl with stars in her eyes")

42:15.700 --> 42:18.368
J' always knew
she'd be a star j'

42:18.369 --> 42:23.290
j' she said she always would j'

42:23.291 --> 42:26.960

42:44.562 --> 42:46.188
- [boy] Hey, sue, what do
you think about bishop?

42:46.189 --> 42:47.814
- We'd rather than
die than go anywhere

42:47.815 --> 42:50.276
hanging around with you guys.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.698
(Whispering)

42:59.702 --> 43:00.869
- I used to be a
naughty girl once,

43:00.870 --> 43:03.456
but I'm not like that anymore.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.592
- Where we going?
- Home.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.302
- It's not the way.

43:17.303 --> 43:19.055
- Taking a shortcut.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.774
- Ah shit, ow.
- What's going on?

43:30.775 --> 43:34.028
- Shut your face
or you'll get it too.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.616
Are you going to let
us screw her or what?

43:39.617 --> 43:41.034
- [Seagull] No way!

43:41.035 --> 43:44.329
- [Strach] Okay, seagull,

43:44.330 --> 43:46.499
(Crying)

43:50.044 --> 43:51.045

Shit, ah!

43:59.887 --> 44:00.888
Shit, ah!

44:04.225 --> 44:05.809
I don't care how
much you hit me,

44:05.810 --> 44:07.394
I'm not going to
let you screw her.

44:07.395 --> 44:08.396
Ah.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.649
- No, don't hit him, no!

44:12.650 --> 44:13.942
(Screaming)

44:13.943 --> 44:15.110
Don't hit him!

44:15.111 --> 44:16.528
I'll screw you, I'll
screw the lot of you,

44:16.529 --> 44:18.447
just stop hurting him.

44:27.290 --> 44:29.208
- Hey, hey, I'm first!

44:30.334 --> 44:31.252
You're second.

44:31.253 --> 44:32.836
You're slops.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.671
- Oh come on, I'm always slops.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.841
- You got slops, alright.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.801
- [Seagull] I get slops.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.095
Bloody a slops.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.222
Dickheads.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.130
- What time do you have
to be home tonight?

45:17.131 --> 45:19.716
- I'm staying at sue's and
I'm allowed to stay out late.

45:19.717 --> 45:20.842
- Good.

45:20.843 --> 45:23.720
- What?
- Good, it's good.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.388
- What about your mom and dad?

45:25.389 --> 45:27.515
- They're away.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.726
- Who's looking after you?

45:29.727 --> 45:30.728
-I am.

45:31.771 --> 45:34.315
(Chattering)

46:00.258 --> 46:02.759
- They didn't even
take her home.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.387
- It's just a moll.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.015
- Don't get involved.

46:09.225 --> 46:10.226
Come on.

46:11.227 --> 46:13.771
(Whistling)

46:25.825 --> 46:26.950
(Laughing)

46:26.951 --> 46:28.243
- [Cheryl] It's strach's
birthday on Monday,

46:28.244 --> 46:29.411
we're going to bake him a cake.

46:29.412 --> 46:30.829
- Perf, what are
you getting him?

46:30.830 --> 46:32.497
- Some black frenchies.

46:32.498 --> 46:34.207
- Black, never heard of them.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.959
- I used to go out with this
surfer in the north shore,

46:35.960 --> 46:37.128
he used them.

46:44.093 --> 46:45.969
- Wish we had a board.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.138
- Why don't we ask if we
can have a loan of one?

46:48.139 --> 46:50.098
- Girls don't surf.

46:50.099 --> 46:52.393
(Giggling)

46:55.813 --> 46:58.940
- Strach, loan us your board?

46:58.941 --> 47:00.817
- [Strach] What for?

47:00.818 --> 47:03.111
- We want to have a go.

47:03.112 --> 47:04.654
- Bite your bum.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.989
- Aw, why not?

47:05.990 --> 47:07.991
- You might ding it.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.117
- [Debbie] Seagull?

47:09.118 --> 47:10.994
- No way, you're not
touching my board.

47:10.995 --> 47:11.829
- You're mean.

47:11.830 --> 47:13.015
- [Lifeguard] I warned
you three times smart ass

47:13.039 --> 47:13.998
and that's enough.

47:13.999 --> 47:15.540
I'm taking that bloody board.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.834
- Scabs!
- What?

47:18.377 --> 47:20.378
- Pubby's trying to
take Glenn's board.

47:20.379 --> 47:21.421
- What for?

47:21.422 --> 47:23.256
- They reckon he was
surfing between the flags.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.175
- [Debbie] Was he?

47:24.176 --> 47:26.134
- No way. (Yelling)

47:26.135 --> 47:27.594
Clubby wanker.

47:27.595 --> 47:28.636
- Watch it.

47:28.637 --> 47:30.263
- Ah, shove it up
your ass, mate.

47:30.264 --> 47:34.352
- You want a fat lip? (Yelling)

47:36.896 --> 47:39.147
- I'll give you
a fat lip, alright.

47:39.148 --> 47:42.400
(Face paced music)

47:42.401 --> 47:44.653
(Yelling)

48:18.229 --> 48:19.354
- Come on, you clubby dick,

48:19.355 --> 48:21.899
I'll knock your bloody heady.

48:26.737 --> 48:27.738
- Look!

48:38.541 --> 48:40.209
- It's me, it's me.

49:06.694 --> 49:09.238

49:30.217 --> 49:31.301
- Alright.

49:31.302 --> 49:33.470
- Yeah, I bet. How did you get?

49:33.471 --> 49:34.680
- Pretty good.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.642
- My old man wants me to
be a dentist like him.

49:39.643 --> 49:41.769
- I couldn't handle that.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.104
-Around in people's
mouths all day,

49:43.105 --> 49:44.606
I'd rather be in the pits.

49:44.607 --> 49:45.483
- Yeah.

49:45.484 --> 49:49.320
- I reckon you'll look
good in a white coat.

49:50.321 --> 49:52.697
- [Carol] Help me
with that one, mom.

49:52.698 --> 49:54.699
- Well, how many
minutes in an hour?

49:54.700 --> 49:56.034
- [Carol] Sixty.

49:56.035 --> 49:59.621
- You take 60 and
you divide it into 420.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.789
You're not wearing
that old thing?

50:01.790 --> 50:02.999
- I like it.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.709
- A least give it an iron.

50:04.710 --> 50:07.045
Go on, it'll only take a minute.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.254
(Scoffing)

50:08.255 --> 50:10.007
What time's garry
picking you up?

50:10.090 --> 50:11.299
- Now.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.550
- Well, you better hurry then.

50:12.551 --> 50:17.681
And tell him not to bring you
home a stroke after midnight.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.645
- Who's she going out with?

50:23.646 --> 50:24.854
- Garry hennessy.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.856
His father's a dentist
down at the junction.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.317
Been there for years.

50:29.318 --> 50:30.319
- Okay.

50:31.362 --> 50:34.073
(Horn honking)

50:35.366 --> 50:37.033
- Listen Debra, tell
whoever's driving

50:37.034 --> 50:38.701
not to go over 30 miles an hour.

50:38.702 --> 50:39.702
Did you iron this.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.204
- [Debra] Yes.

50:41.205 --> 50:43.039
- Where are you going?
- To the movies.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.082
- Don't sit near the aisle.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.208
- Why not?

50:45.209 --> 50:46.709
- Some pusher may
come along and jab you

50:46.710 --> 50:49.045
in the arm with
heaven knows what.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.047
- Mom.

50:50.756 --> 50:53.049
- I read about it in the paper.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.051
- Bye.
- Bye.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.972
- [Glenn] Don't bug on it, man.

51:45.561 --> 51:48.689
- Well, what are
we going to do now?

51:49.565 --> 51:51.274
- I don't know.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.859
What do you reckon, guys?

51:52.860 --> 51:54.153
- I don't know.

51:55.237 --> 51:57.448
- What are we going to do?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.992
- Why don't we
blow another joint.

52:00.993 --> 52:02.703
- [Glenn] Good idea.

52:03.787 --> 52:06.832
- I got the munchies.
- Yeah me too.

52:08.917 --> 52:12.879
- Do you want to go
get something to eat?

52:12.880 --> 52:14.131
Do you reckon.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.300
- I don't know, Glenn?

52:17.301 --> 52:18.593
- [Glenn] Whatever
you want, man.

52:18.594 --> 52:20.429
- What do you reckon?

52:21.555 --> 52:23.473
- I think I'll have a
cavan aussie special

52:23.474 --> 52:26.142
with a chocolate thick shake.

52:26.143 --> 52:29.771
- Two hamburgers.
- Quarter pounder with cheese.

52:29.772 --> 52:30.938
(Chattering)

52:30.939 --> 52:33.316
- Two pieces of cheesecake.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.778
(Chattering)

52:47.581 --> 52:50.459
(Waves crashing)

52:56.465 --> 53:00.635
- [TV] In a few short months,
95% of Australian showman

53:00.636 --> 53:04.180
will be forced to wear off
the sound and walk out.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.598
- Just in time.

53:05.599 --> 53:06.933
Did you enjoy yourself?

53:06.934 --> 53:09.978
- Yeah, it was a
really good movie.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.356
- What's the smell?

53:13.357 --> 53:15.024
- What?

53:15.025 --> 53:17.610
- Don't say what, Debra.

53:17.611 --> 53:18.736
- It's incense.

53:18.737 --> 53:21.490
Danny's burning some in his car.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.827
- Want some pizza?

53:25.828 --> 53:29.247
- There's some in
the oven if you want it?

53:29.248 --> 53:31.667
- Did I say something funny?

53:34.670 --> 53:35.546
What's funny?

53:35.547 --> 53:38.381
- Goodness only knows.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.258
- I don't know what's
got into that girl.

53:40.259 --> 53:43.554
- Oh, it's all part
of puberty, frank.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.973
- [Man] By the way Mr. Peam,

53:46.974 --> 53:50.977
really sorry you lost
your star account.

53:50.978 --> 53:53.855
- Houdini and his Mrs.
- Houdini and his wife.

53:53.856 --> 53:56.524
- [Man] They had another offer.

53:56.525 --> 53:58.651
- [Man] Well that's
gratitude for you.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.403
After all Mr. Peam did for them.

54:00.404 --> 54:05.534
- [Man] Those damn foreigners,
you can't trust any of them.

54:07.995 --> 54:10.663
- [Debbie] Hi, had to stay
back and finish an assignment.

54:10.664 --> 54:13.417
- [Garry] Got something for you.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.256
- Oh, garry.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.051
Oh, I love it.

54:28.515 --> 54:29.807
You weren't on the
bus this morning.

54:29.808 --> 54:31.267
- No, I slept in.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.435
- Did you go out last night?

54:32.436 --> 54:36.689
- Yeah, just the milk bar,
hang out there for a while.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.275
Had a hit last night.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.693
- Why?

54:40.694 --> 54:43.446
- Strach has some, let's
not damper out the moment.

54:43.447 --> 54:45.031
- That's dangerous, garry.

54:45.032 --> 54:46.115
- No, it's not.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.118
Not if you know
what you're doing.

54:48.202 --> 54:49.786
It's really good, Deb.

54:49.787 --> 54:50.829
It's unreal.

54:52.331 --> 54:53.874
- I don't like it.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.587
- [Sue] Here, let me see, Deb.

54:59.588 --> 55:00.963
Hold it up.

55:00.964 --> 55:03.050
Ah, that's so beautiful.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.177
Eighteen karat?

55:06.178 --> 55:07.970
- [Debbie] Yep.

55:07.971 --> 55:12.475
- [Sue] Does garry, you
know, does he, do you?

55:12.476 --> 55:13.477
- No.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.979
- But you've been
going around for months,

55:16.980 --> 55:18.898
doesn't he hassle you?

55:18.899 --> 55:21.150
- He really likes me.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.860
- You're so lucky.
- Yeah.

55:22.861 --> 55:26.740
- Danny'll drop me if
I didn't root for him.

55:32.120 --> 55:35.039
- [Debbie] Every holiday
we went to mackerel beach.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.499
Ho hum.

55:36.500 --> 55:40.002
Just boring old pinchiners,
fisherman and little kids.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.506
(Chattering)

55:46.134 --> 55:49.346
- Nine, okay and
it's you to go, Mae.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.642
- Good girl.
- Five.

55:54.643 --> 55:57.521
- You girls keep
an eye on Carol.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.898
- Hope she gets
eaten by a shark.

56:00.899 --> 56:02.025
- [Sue] Yeah.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.411
- [Debbie] God,
isn't it boring here.

56:13.412 --> 56:14.872
- [Sue], I know.

56:17.624 --> 56:18.709
- Hey.
- What?

56:19.710 --> 56:21.377
- [Debbie] I wonder
what the boys are doing?

56:21.378 --> 56:22.712
- [Sue] Yeah.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.547
- Dead set, garry,
it's really perfy,

56:24.548 --> 56:26.382
you and Danny should come up.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.259
- What's he saying?

56:28.260 --> 56:30.386
- Just catch the ferry up
and hang around the wharf,

56:30.387 --> 56:31.680
we'll find you.

56:34.016 --> 56:35.225
Okay, see you.

56:37.644 --> 56:39.980
(Giggling)

56:42.399 --> 56:43.858
- [Sue] When are they going
to come, did they say?

56:43.859 --> 56:45.944
- [Debbie] I don't know.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.912
- Great surf.
- Yeah.

56:57.998 --> 57:01.292
(Ferry horn blowing)

57:01.293 --> 57:03.210
- [Debbie] You two could do
without the surf one day,

57:03.211 --> 57:04.212
can't you?

57:05.464 --> 57:07.006
- [Garry] Why don't
we blow a joint?

57:07.007 --> 57:09.175
- [Danny] Right on.

57:09.176 --> 57:10.968
- [Debbie] Not here, I don't
want my olds to see it.

57:10.969 --> 57:13.220
- [Danny] Where?

57:13.221 --> 57:14.722
- [Debbie] There's an
empty house down there.

57:14.723 --> 57:16.433
- [Danny] Let's go.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.439
(Dog barking)

57:28.278 --> 57:29.695
- [Danny] You ever
been inside before?

57:29.696 --> 57:30.864
- [Debbie] No.

58:04.064 --> 58:05.273
- Great place.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.905
Ta-da!

58:12.906 --> 58:15.158
The mackerel beach Hilton.

58:22.916 --> 58:27.294
- [Sue] It's great, look at
this Danny, lots of rooms.

58:27.295 --> 58:28.546
- [Danny] Who owns this place?

58:28.547 --> 58:31.507
- Don't know, it's
a holiday house.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.301
They never come here.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.852
- It's better than study.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.186
- No thanks.

58:44.187 --> 58:46.397
- Do you want to smoke?

58:46.398 --> 58:47.565
- What's that?
- Coke.

58:47.566 --> 58:50.026
- Garry, where'd you get that?

58:50.027 --> 58:51.694
- Down the pub.

58:51.695 --> 58:53.195
- Where'd you get the money?

58:53.196 --> 58:55.698
- I hocked my old
man's cassette player.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.324
- You oaf.

58:57.325 --> 59:00.078
- Don't worry, I'll get it back.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.162
- Ah, shit.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.583
Sturdy chair.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.169
- Do a line, mate?

59:08.837 --> 59:09.838
- No thanks.

59:10.839 --> 59:13.549
- You two could stay here
tonight, couldn't they, Deb?

59:13.550 --> 59:15.176
- I suppose so,
nobody would know.

59:15.177 --> 59:16.553
- I don't mind.

59:30.859 --> 59:32.318
- What's wrong?

59:32.319 --> 59:33.861
- I don't like you doing that.

59:33.862 --> 59:34.987
- Kissing you?

59:34.988 --> 59:37.156
- You know what I mean.

59:37.157 --> 59:39.366
- Will you come here tonight?

59:39.367 --> 59:40.743
- Might not be able to get away.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.411
- You can sneak out?

59:42.412 --> 59:46.290
- My olds would really freak
if they found me missing.

59:46.291 --> 59:49.251
- Well, we might as well go,
there's no surf or anything.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.963
- [Debbie] Surfing, that's
all you ever think about.

59:52.047 --> 59:54.006
- No it's not.

59:54.007 --> 59:56.009
You know it's not, Deb.

59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.263
I really want you to
come here tonight.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.274
(Light crashing)

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.403
(Crickets chirping)

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.285
- Hey.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.204
- Get back to bed.

01:00:24.205 --> 01:00:25.746
- I'm going to tell mom.

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:27.206
- You do and I'll
kick your teeth in.

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:30.876
- Give me 50
cents or I'll scream.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:32.920
- Okay, okay, I'll
give you 50 cents.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.046
- [Sue] Come on, Deb.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.422
- Not now, later.

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:36.883
Get back to bed.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:15.171
- [Sue] We're lucky
we got here at all,

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.006
Debbie's little sister -

01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:19.341
- shh, just watch
this, it's a top show.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.220
(Muffled speech)

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.017
How are you?

01:01:27.018 --> 01:01:28.852
- Good.
- How are you?

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.461
- Found some
blankets and sheets.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.879
Would you like a drink
ofjuice or something?

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.963
- No thanks.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:01.051
- We found some
teas in the kitchen.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.011
Be back.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:03:00.068
(Birds chirping)
(Waves crashing)

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:06.949
I really like you, Deb.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.909
- I like you too.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.288
- I mean, I really like you.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:17.668
- I've got to go outside.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:22.257
Give it to me and I'll throw
it away while I'm there.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.050
- It's gone.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.678
- What do you mean?

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.932
- [Garry] I can't find it.

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:34.310
(Laughing)

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.104
- [Debbie] Oh, rats, let's
hope we find the soddy thing.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:39.399
(Laughing)

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.615
I can feel something.

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:50.284
- Where?

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:51.286
- There.

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.664
- Oh shit, it's the last time

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.709
I use one of those
bloody things.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.838
- Debbie, quick.
- The sun's coming up.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.173
Quick, jump in some clothes.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.175
- Morning.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.138
- Hurry up, your
parents will freak.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.648
(Chattering)

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:31.493
- [Debbie] Nothing.

01:04:31.494 --> 01:04:33.619
- [Garry] Jesus, how
many days is that?

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.037
- [Debbie] Six.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.455
Tracy reckons you
should start worrying

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:38.123
when you're more
than three days overdue.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:41.752
- [Garry] Well, what
are you going to do?

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:44.171
- [Debbie] When Cheryl's
overdue she rides a horse bareback.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:45.547
- [Garry] Does it work?

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.132
- [Debbie] I don't know.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.011
Some of the girls get strach
to punch me in the stomach.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:52.722
I think I'd rather be pregnant.

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:58.353
- [Garry] I've got a
science test tomorrow.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.905
- Hello, darling, I've
got a surprise for you.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.658
- What?
- We're getting a new car.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.786
- Aren't you excited?
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.372
- Honestly Debra, I don't
know what gets into you.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:19.249
You've never been the same

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:21.333
since you've stopped
going to fellowship.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.418
Your father's coming home early

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.169
so we can go and pick it up.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.170
- [Debbie] Do I have to come?

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:27.173
- Of course you do.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.925
I'd thought you
be excited about it.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:30.926
Carol is.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:34.096
- Yeah, we'll Carol's
only a kid, isn't she?

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.475
- Just hurry up and
get changed, Debra.

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:55.201
Come on, Debra,

01:05:55.202 --> 01:05:58.120
I'm not having you spoil
today for your father.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:59.955
- No one cares
about spoiling my day.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.124
- Oh, come on.

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:08.672
- He comes the young lady now.

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:12.843
We're waiting to hear what
you think of the color.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.761
- Come on, sweetheart,
what do you think?

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:16.097
- It's alright.

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:21.435
- Well, it's better than
the old heap, isn't it?

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:22.644
- I suppose.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.271
- Most young ladies like blue.

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:25.731
I bet that's your
favorite color isn't is?

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:26.733
- No.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:28.984
- (Honking)
- Carol.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.652
- Don't worry about it.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.322
I bet it's red then. Right?

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:36.993
- Ours is the same
as this only it's red.

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:41.705
- Hope you won't be
disappointed, frank.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.040
- [Frank] No, I'm
sure you're right.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.292
- We're the toilet?

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:46.419
- Over there.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.893
(Chattering)

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.733
- Check Debbie
vickers with her olds.

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.194
- Don't know why we had
to come to this one.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.196
- Why not, it's the
closest to home.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.822
- Yeah.

01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:17.450
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.662
- What's wrong?
- I'm not hungry.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.039
- [Carol] I am.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.794
- What's she doing now?

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.837
- Going to the toilet, I think.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:33.341
- She just... she just went.

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:01.911
("I hope I never")

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.130

- No, I haven't
seen him for heaps.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:35.402
- Used to go around with him.

- Hi, Debbie, I haven't seen

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:51.645
He's in his room studying.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.188
At least I hope he is.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.939
His father hasn't
been too pleased

01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:56.191
with his exam results lately.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:10:01.363

Still haven't got my period.

What'll I do if I'm pregnant?

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.242
Garry.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.245
You're out of it, aren't you?

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.872

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:52.874

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:56.728
- Would you like a day in bed?

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.313
- Yes.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.190
- Alright.

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:01.900
- How about some toast and
some vegemite and a cup of tea?

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.069
- No, thanks.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.657

- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.420
- Deb, how?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:06.089
- I don't know, I just went
to the toilet and there it was.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.634
- (Giggling)
- That's great.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.385
It's good.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.220
You going to tell garry?

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.848
- He wouldn't care.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.143
Look, got this the other day.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.227
- Isn't it great.
- Oh, wow.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:22.105
- Yeah, try some.

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.984
(Waves crashing)

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:38.164
(Chattering)

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.438
Perf, who made it?

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.482
- We both did
but Cheryl iced it.

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:07.192
- We were having a
good game of cards

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:09.903
til these chicks come along.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:10.905
I'm out.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.015
- Three fives.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.309
- [Strach] Out.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.311
- Two aces.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.486
- [Debbie] Why don't we got
to the movies or something?

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.779
- [Strach] What for?

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.781
- [Debbie] It's better
than sitting around here.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:57.158
- [Strach] Are we
playing cards or what?

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.119
- [Debbie] We could go
for a drive or something?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.037
- Yeah, we don't have the waves.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:03.164
- [Debbie] I meant
into town or something.

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.750
- [Strach] What for?

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:10.380
- [Debbie] All you're
interested in is surfing.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:11.382
- So.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.926
- There are other
things, you know.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.762
- [Strach] Like what?

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.057
- You boys really make me sick.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:24.310
There's heaps of other
things we could do.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:29.525
We could go to the movies or
go and see a band or something.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:38.367
There's more to life than
just surfing, you know.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.039
(Snickering)

01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:49.711
Wouldn't you like to go to
the movies or something?

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.838
- We went to a
drive-in last Friday.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:53.548
- [Strach] Bruce, three.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.301
- [Bruce] Fuck, four.

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:59.972
(Boys chattering)

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:08.730
- [Vicki] I like that one.

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:10.565
The one with silver and gold.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.733
- [Tracy] I like the gold one.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:12.984
- Which one?
- That one.

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:14.152
- Isn't that one nice.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:16.321
- Yeah, that one nice,
do you like that one.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:18.866
(Chattering)

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:26.831
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:27.708
- [Boy] What's going on?

01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:29.626
- [Girl] Let's have a look.

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:32.129
(Chattering)

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.643
- What happened?

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:51.106
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.233
(Chattering)

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:54.234
- [Officer] Move back.

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:55.277
Back please.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:03.910
(Intense music)

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:05.913
- What happened to him?

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.917
(Crying)

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:33.065
- [Officer] Show's
over, let's go.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.710
- Danny!

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.539
- Beaches close in three days.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.234
- It stinks.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:42.236
- What?

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:44.822
- Everything.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:05.092
(Chattering)

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:11.931
- Do you still reckon
we should do it?

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:13.641
- Of course.
- Honest?

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.310
- Come on.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.646
- But everyone will see us.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:19.815
- Too bad.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.987
(Lively music)

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:33.119
- [Girl] Chicks.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.663
- [Girl] Hope they're
not scared of sharks.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.958
- You molls.
- You toilets.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.337
- [Man] Good day, gidget.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:44.256

01:20:58.395 --> 01:20:59.396
- Look.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.859
- [Strach] Slackass molls.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.696
- Get lost.
- Ah, shut your face.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:12.742
- (Chattering)
- Probably can't even surf.

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:14.702
- What do you got that for?

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.037
- We're going to surf.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.121
- Ah, you westies.

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.331
- Chicks don't surf.

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:19.750
- Just you wait.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:25.047
- Jesus.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.549
- [Sue] Let us go first, Deb.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.884
- See you catch
a wave, eh Danny.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.052
- They'll never be able
to catch a wave anyway.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.762
- This'll be good.
- Rubbernecks!

01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:35.307
- Look at that big ass, moll.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:41.312
Who do they think they are?

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:43.064
(Laughing)

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.065
At least they work atjungle red.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.317
- How embarrassing.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:47.736
- Paddle, go, go!

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.912
- You chicks are bent!

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:58.956

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:07.922
(“Nobody takes me

(Waves crashing)

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:52.318
- [Debbie] Did you see
the look on their faces?

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.028
Tracy, did you see
the look on her face?

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.449
Her eyes nearly
popped out of her head.

01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:10.837
- Great day.
- Yeah, unreal.

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:15.383
