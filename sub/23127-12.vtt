WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:03.227
- Previously on Being Human...

00:03.270 --> 00:06.194
Julia is beautiful and normal.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.298
This is my do-over, man.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.900
- I know how to lift this curse.

00:09.940 --> 00:12.272
It's about finding
the man who turned you.

00:12.310 --> 00:13.732
- The wolf is a gift.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.305
- If you kill him,
you're free.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.742
- You took away the only person
who meant something to me.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.112
I will never forgive you
for what you did.

00:21.150 --> 00:24.279
- No one in our world is to have
anything to do with Aidan White.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.654
- I am banished from all
vampires under penalty of death.

00:27.690 --> 00:28.657
- Aidan's leaving.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.055
- I wanted my freedom.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.683
You wanted to move
on from Boston.

00:31.730 --> 00:32.822
But we can have it all.

00:32.860 --> 00:35.852
- You thought
we'd just let you run?

00:37.930 --> 00:39.295
(Fangs clicking)

00:41.940 --> 00:44.307
- (Josh): I used to be
afraid of the dark.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.307
When you're 6 years old,

00:45.340 --> 00:48.071
a shadowed bedroom
can seem as terrifying

00:48.110 --> 00:50.750
as the night sky must've been
to ancient man.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.272
And those things said
to go bump in the night

00:53.320 --> 00:55.049
can feel just as real.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.344
- The turnaround on this
particular betrayal

00:57.390 --> 00:59.358
is awful fast,
even for you.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.188
- I was only
following your advice,

01:01.220 --> 01:02.927
to return to the fold,

01:02.960 --> 01:05.349
do everything
Mother asks of me.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.789
(Growling)

01:07.830 --> 01:09.719
(Grunting)

01:15.300 --> 01:17.359
I'm sorry, old friend,

01:17.410 --> 01:19.060
but an order's an order.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.869
(Growling)

01:26.380 --> 01:28.212
(Groaning)

01:38.290 --> 01:42.693
** Are we are on
the lonely side?

01:42.730 --> 01:45.290
* Say oh, now

01:45.330 --> 01:48.129
* The past long away...

01:50.340 --> 01:52.399
- I'd imagine
something was hiding

01:52.440 --> 01:54.135
in the dark corners of my room,

01:54.180 --> 01:57.002
a monster, ghost.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.677
I'd bolt right up in bed,

01:58.710 --> 02:00.849
terrified, screaming
for my mother.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.348
(Baby crying)

02:02.390 --> 02:04.415
- Zoe, where are
the heck are you?

02:04.450 --> 02:06.885
- Eventually, I grew up,
got over it,

02:06.920 --> 02:09.287
learned that if I could
just hang on,

02:09.330 --> 02:11.321
the sun would
always rise again.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.352
But then everything changed.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.769
In the night, "dark" came to
mean something very different.

02:21.370 --> 02:22.906
That the turn was coming.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.408
* Somebody left the gate open

02:24.440 --> 02:26.875
* You know we got lost
on the way...

02:28.140 --> 02:31.201
- (Echoing): You smell it too,
don't you, Josh?

02:31.250 --> 02:33.344
- (Nora): If you kill him,
you're free.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.319
- Something's coming.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.322
Is this what you're looking for?

02:47.230 --> 02:50.165
You know you don't
have it in you.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.134
* Into the wild

02:54.170 --> 02:55.990
* How are we living?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.405
* Living, living

02:57.440 --> 03:00.330
* Oh how, how, how...

03:00.380 --> 03:04.146
- So the childish night terrors
came right back.

03:04.180 --> 03:08.310
Because now, I'm one of
those things that go bump.

03:08.350 --> 03:11.217
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *

03:11.250 --> 03:13.981
(* Whistling )

03:24.430 --> 03:26.068
- This isn't over, Aidan.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.932
Mother will keep
coming after you.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.961
- Then that singular
ability you have

03:30.010 --> 03:32.729
to endear yourself to the royal
family has finally paid off.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.771
If they'd sent anyone else,
it would've ended differently.

03:34.810 --> 03:36.209
<i>- She will send
someone else!</i>

03:36.250 --> 03:38.048
And they'll keep
coming after you

03:38.080 --> 03:41.448
until Suren's back home, tied up
in Mother's apron strings.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.187
Let me help you.

03:43.220 --> 03:46.781
I managed to stay hidden for
the better part of a century.

03:46.820 --> 03:50.120
Together, we have
a fighting chance.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.299
But you have to
leave her behind.

03:52.330 --> 03:55.356
- Henry, I'm not
leaving her behind.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.266
- Then you're dead.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.270
- I appreciate what
you did back there,

04:00.300 --> 04:03.201
but I do have
a few years on you.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.800
I'm familiar with
the struggle to survive.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.739
(Scoffing)

04:06.780 --> 04:09.442
- Mother's offer might've
been vindictive,

04:09.480 --> 04:11.005
but you have to admit,

04:11.050 --> 04:13.348
this is what you
always wanted,

04:13.380 --> 04:16.384
to live among humans,
to be free of all of this.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.454
- Freedom on her terms
is no freedom at all.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.151
Maybe I want more.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.358
- Is Suren really worth it?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.959
(Loon calling)

04:29.400 --> 04:34.429
- You know, Bishop used to
say the same thing about you.

04:34.470 --> 04:36.438
(Sighing)

04:36.470 --> 04:38.302
You're going back
to Boston, kid.

04:38.340 --> 04:42.129
(Groaning)

04:42.180 --> 04:44.444
- Shhh! Shhh!
It's OK, it's OK.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.448
Listen to me.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.118
I'm the outcast,
not you.

04:48.150 --> 04:52.041
You belong safely in on
the inside, and you always have.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.309
Now, this wound,
it's deep

04:54.360 --> 04:56.328
and it will convince Mother
that you put up a good fight.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.623
And no one will
be surprised

04:57.660 --> 04:59.458
that I stopped short
of killing you,

04:59.500 --> 05:02.424
because it's like
you always said:

05:02.470 --> 05:04.290
I'm nothing,
if not sentimental.

05:04.330 --> 05:05.593
- Aaah!

05:05.630 --> 05:07.496
(Groaning)

05:12.110 --> 05:15.171
We have a talent
for goodbyes, you and I.

05:16.980 --> 05:20.109
- Let's hope we don't have
to wait another 80 years.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.956
(Birds chirping)

05:34.460 --> 05:37.464
- Of course
I'm late again.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.439
- Wow! Our mornings
are progressing

05:42.470 --> 05:44.029
at vastly different rates.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.504
I'm still on 8 across.

05:45.540 --> 05:48.976
- I'm sorry. I sort of
have somewhere to be.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.648
- Don't you know
how rare it is

05:50.680 --> 05:53.980
for a doctor and the
lower-ranking hospital employee

05:54.020 --> 05:57.445
with whom she's is engaged in
an inappropriate relationship

05:57.490 --> 05:59.288
to have simultaneous
days off?

05:59.320 --> 06:00.879
- Josh, it's Chelsea.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.082
She's in town.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.451
- Oh, God.

06:10.230 --> 06:12.324
For the record, the abject
terror on my face

06:12.370 --> 06:14.338
isn't an entirely
accurate reflection

06:14.370 --> 06:16.464
of how I feel about
your best friend.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.935
- And I told her weeks ago
that I was seeing someone,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.108
but I left out the part
about how that someone

06:22.140 --> 06:24.347
is the demon man-child
who ruins lives.

06:25.710 --> 06:31.490
That's what she started calling
you after you ran out on me.

06:31.520 --> 06:35.058
- Huh! Succinct.

06:35.090 --> 06:39.254
- I wanted to make sure that
we were really together first,

06:39.290 --> 06:41.099
that this was gonna stick.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.427
You know
how she is.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.290
- Hence the abject terror.

06:45.430 --> 06:47.637
You wanna tell
Chelsea about us?

06:49.140 --> 06:51.359
- But I also know
that she'll go home

06:51.410 --> 06:55.904
and open that always-gigantic
mouth of hers around Ithaca,

06:55.940 --> 06:58.409
- which means it's
just a matter of time

06:58.450 --> 07:00.339
before our parents are
sobbing over the phone,

07:00.380 --> 07:05.250
insisting how they always knew
we'd work things out someday.

07:05.290 --> 07:08.510
So I wanted
to make sure that...

07:10.230 --> 07:12.289
you wanna tell
Chelsea too.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.224
(Sighing)

07:17.200 --> 07:19.328
- I wanna say
the right thing here.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.190
- Well, don't by--

07:21.240 --> 07:23.265
- No, I won't.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.540
I want this to work.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.200
Please know that.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.373
But yes, there
are some things

07:35.420 --> 07:37.548
that I need to
work out for myself.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.419
'Cause I'm not--
I won't hurt you again.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.950
OK?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.290
- OK.

07:48.330 --> 07:49.252
(Chuckles)

07:49.300 --> 07:52.463
Look, the fact that
you're addressing it--

07:52.500 --> 07:54.468
- That's for us.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.800
- Yes. That's what
matters to me.

07:59.110 --> 08:02.330
But you could also
meet us for drinks at 4:00,

08:02.380 --> 08:04.246
get it over with.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.169
It would mean a lot.

08:10.350 --> 08:12.239
I'll call you.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.360
(Taps thigh)

08:13.390 --> 08:14.551
- Yeah.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.670
(Siren wailing)

08:25.700 --> 08:28.499
- (Woman on PA): Extension 2362,
Joanne Lawson...

08:30.110 --> 08:33.375
- Hey, so fries...

08:33.409 --> 08:34.400
(Chuckling)

08:34.440 --> 08:35.407
...at 10:00 a.m.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.568
I mean, yum!

08:38.610 --> 08:40.419
(Chuckling)

08:42.320 --> 08:44.448
So I just came
from maternity.

08:44.490 --> 08:47.710
Maybe you forgot
to salt the door.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.522
- Maybe I did.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.456
- OK, 'cause, um, I just
thought that the whole, um,

08:56.500 --> 08:59.367
open-season-for-baby-jumping
thing was something

08:59.400 --> 09:00.799
that we were
trying to avoid,

09:00.840 --> 09:02.399
so maybe you should...

09:02.440 --> 09:03.760
- What?

09:03.810 --> 09:06.438
You're worried a ghost
would act selfishly,

09:06.470 --> 09:08.529
use a human being
to get what they want

09:08.580 --> 09:11.504
with no regard for the
ramifications of their actions?

09:11.550 --> 09:13.279
- Zoe, look...

09:14.320 --> 09:16.687
I am so sorry for
what I did to Nick.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.280
It wasn't me.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.085
I was sick.
You saw that.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.679
And I'm getting
better now.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.859
If you don't believe me,
just ask my roommates.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.222
- Which one of them signed off
on your mental stability?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.227
Was it the vampire
or the werewolf?

09:33.270 --> 09:35.090
You know why
I can't bring myself

09:35.140 --> 09:37.529
to keep protecting
those babies upstairs?

09:37.570 --> 09:39.607
It's because of you,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.404
because of what
you did to Nick.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.646
- No!

09:42.680 --> 09:44.375
- Every time
I see a ghost,

09:44.410 --> 09:46.378
I'm reminded that
being a medium

09:46.410 --> 09:48.515
is what's kept me
alone all my life,

09:48.550 --> 09:50.086
that it's a curse.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.815
So you're on your own now,
all of you.

10:15.540 --> 10:19.204
- If you want to lift this
curse, you have kill Ray

10:19.250 --> 10:20.411
while he's still a man.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.449
- Dad!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.657
- How's it going?
Ready for school?

10:29.690 --> 10:31.385
Not gonna
let me go, are ya?

10:31.430 --> 10:32.556
(Chuckling)

10:35.930 --> 10:38.365
Thanks. Bye.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.131
Take care.
Have a good day.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.575
(Engine starting)

10:50.480 --> 10:52.278
Josh!

10:58.220 --> 11:00.314
(Crow cawing)

11:03.960 --> 11:05.780
(Sniffling)

11:05.830 --> 11:07.525
(Sighing)

11:07.560 --> 11:11.667
- See, I thought we had a sort
of an unspoken agreement going.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.964
You were the one
who told me to get lost.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.263
Remember?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.938
- I'm sorry...

11:18.010 --> 11:20.229
about how
we left things.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.272
I know we had
our differences.

11:23.310 --> 11:27.872
- If that's what you wanna call
turning your back on a brother.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.345
- A lot's happened
since then, Ray,

11:31.390 --> 11:35.850
most of it
decidedly unpleasant.

11:35.890 --> 11:39.588
It turns out
you were right about me,

11:39.630 --> 11:42.520
about denying
the wolf.

11:42.560 --> 11:47.259
And I have a 2nd
chance now with a girl.

11:51.540 --> 11:55.272
And you--you are the only
other person I've ever met

11:55.310 --> 11:57.176
who's like me, so I--

11:57.210 --> 12:00.942
- So you thought it
might be worth reaching out.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.914
(Birds chirping)

12:08.220 --> 12:10.120
I told you, didn't I?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.583
That you'd come
looking for me,

12:12.630 --> 12:14.359
that one day,
you'd get it.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.799
Eh?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.061
(Chuckles)

12:20.400 --> 12:22.198
(Both chuckling)

12:22.240 --> 12:24.038
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.538
- Yeah, yeah.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.402
Yeah, I guess so.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.603
I mean, the house.
My God! The job.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.846
- The business.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.211
(Chuckling)

12:34.250 --> 12:36.548
Yeah, it turns out that
uncanny bond with nature

12:36.580 --> 12:39.242
can be milked for
a pretty respectable income.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.519
(Chuckling)

12:40.560 --> 12:44.519
And me and my wife renewed
the vows and everything.

12:46.130 --> 12:48.121
(Sniffling)

12:48.160 --> 12:50.527
I got 'em back, Josh.

12:51.530 --> 12:53.430
My boy, too.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.232
And I have a piece
of advice for you.

12:58.270 --> 13:01.331
You tell that girl
of yours the truth.

13:04.410 --> 13:07.971
- Your wife knows
about the wolf?

13:08.020 --> 13:10.512
- Look, when I turned,
I ran out on them, right?

13:10.550 --> 13:15.249
But as lonely as I was, I knew
Val had to be hurting too.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.156
(Sniffling)

13:17.190 --> 13:19.522
There were tears, sure.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.860
But she and I,
we worked through it.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.322
And now...

13:26.030 --> 13:28.692
I get to live
my truth, Josh.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.478
I gotta shackle myself

13:33.510 --> 13:36.673
in a steel-paneled
basement once a month, but...

13:36.710 --> 13:37.677
(Chuckling)

13:37.710 --> 13:39.439
...we all got
something, right?

13:43.020 --> 13:44.943
- I'm happy for you.

13:48.460 --> 13:52.385
- Why don't you
look me up sometime?

13:55.560 --> 13:58.495
There's no reason
we can't be friends.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.537
(Sighing)

14:15.480 --> 14:18.541
- Where were you?
I'm starving in this motel!

14:18.590 --> 14:21.560
Though its variety of peanut-
butter crackers is impressive,

14:21.590 --> 14:24.184
the vending machine's
running low on fresh blood.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.426
- You have to hang on
just a little while longer.

14:26.460 --> 14:27.530
Henry won't give up
our location.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.550
- No!

14:28.600 --> 14:30.591
- But every time we go outside,
we risk exposure.

14:30.630 --> 14:33.395
I will come back for you when
I've secured a hiding place.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.635
You'll have blood then.

14:34.670 --> 14:37.002
- No! I won't sit here

14:37.040 --> 14:39.463
like some damsel waiting
for you to rescue me!

14:39.510 --> 14:41.399
I can fight my own battles.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.479
- But after today, we won't
have to fight anymore!

14:45.510 --> 14:47.012
(Grunting)

14:47.050 --> 14:49.417
(Both panting)

14:57.530 --> 14:59.419
- I have to go back.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.063
Mother will do anything
to control me,

15:04.100 --> 15:07.035
and that means as long
as we keep running,

15:07.070 --> 15:08.492
your life is in danger.

15:08.540 --> 15:12.067
- No, no! You just
need to trust me.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.579
Suren, this can work.

15:14.610 --> 15:18.399
Where we're headed, it's
isolated and it's off the grid,

15:18.450 --> 15:23.286
and it's the only place where we
can be truly free of her reach.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.618
- Something
happened to you.

15:25.650 --> 15:28.153
- No. Hey, hey, hey.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.453
(Sniffling)

15:29.490 --> 15:32.050
Nothing's gonna
happen to me, OK?

15:32.090 --> 15:34.559
I just need you
to wait here.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.262
OK? Can you do that?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.564
(Sighing)

15:41.600 --> 15:43.307
(Moans)

15:46.640 --> 15:48.608
All right?

15:48.640 --> 15:51.041
We're almost on
the other side of this.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.311
- Hurry, please?

16:04.330 --> 16:06.253
(Car honking)

16:11.500 --> 16:13.195
- And then
there were two.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.800
- Did--did you find Zoe?

16:15.840 --> 16:19.105
- Suffice it to say
that if this was AA,

16:19.140 --> 16:21.279
step 9 would be my Everest.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.108
Hey.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.640
Oprah me.

16:32.150 --> 16:35.188
- If you were a woman...
- Hmm!

16:35.220 --> 16:38.383
- ...of the blood
and guts variety,

16:38.430 --> 16:40.353
and therefore
entirely unaware

16:40.400 --> 16:43.199
of the totality of
the supernatural world--

16:43.230 --> 16:44.868
- Ah, the bliss!

16:44.900 --> 16:47.232
- Right. Would you
want to know

16:47.270 --> 16:50.205
if your boyfriend had
this revolting secret

16:50.240 --> 16:53.505
that borderline ruined
his life on a daily basis,

16:53.540 --> 16:58.239
or would you rather
remain blissful...

16:59.550 --> 17:02.440
but never have the chance to
completely understand him?

17:05.450 --> 17:08.282
- Well, as difficult
as it is for me

17:08.319 --> 17:10.378
to crack that brilliantly
disguised hypothetical...

17:10.430 --> 17:11.420
(Grunts)

17:11.460 --> 17:14.395
...why would you wanna
tell Julia about the wolf?

17:14.430 --> 17:16.728
Thought everything was
hearts and rainbows there.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.763
- That's exactly why.
- Well...

17:19.800 --> 17:22.132
- Well, Julia isn't
just some J Date

17:22.170 --> 17:24.207
who made it to
coffee number two.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.402
You don't get
back together

17:26.440 --> 17:28.204
with the woman who
you left at the altar

17:28.240 --> 17:30.971
if you're not pretty sure
you're totally committed.

17:31.010 --> 17:33.320
- Well, are you?

17:33.350 --> 17:37.787
_ Because this is
life-changing information.

17:37.820 --> 17:41.051
- But lying is what got us
here in the first place.

17:41.090 --> 17:45.186
Isn't it my responsibility
to try to make things right,

17:45.230 --> 17:46.857
whatever it takes?

17:55.440 --> 17:58.535
** What will become
of the truth

17:58.570 --> 18:01.437
* When we keep it in?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.299
(Breathing unevenly)

18:06.350 --> 18:08.819
* The things
we don't remember

18:08.850 --> 18:12.741
* When they ask us

18:16.120 --> 18:18.088
(Sighing)

18:18.130 --> 18:20.189
* When we did the things

18:20.230 --> 18:24.497
* That we learned
we shouldn't do again

18:29.200 --> 18:31.202
* Maybe this is my heart

18:31.240 --> 18:35.438
* And maybe it is yours

18:41.220 --> 18:43.188
* Look at what they praise
Nothing

18:43.220 --> 18:46.212
* If I wanna leave
I will

18:46.250 --> 18:49.288
* Stand on my feet
I do

18:49.320 --> 18:51.186
* It only takes these words

18:51.230 --> 18:55.189
* You never believe are true *

18:56.530 --> 18:58.191
- You have to wait.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.335
They're not to be
woken before sundown.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.338
- Which one is he?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.165
No?

19:06.210 --> 19:08.577
I guess I'll have
to cut them all open.

19:08.610 --> 19:11.170
- Stop, please!

19:11.210 --> 19:14.077
- I don't have
time to wait.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.179
You wake him up now.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.215
- Hey!

19:21.260 --> 19:23.228
- Hi!

19:24.290 --> 19:25.519
- Chelsea.

19:27.630 --> 19:28.597
Ha!

19:28.630 --> 19:29.791
- Mmm!

19:30.570 --> 19:33.198
- She took it
that well, huh?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.095
- I don't know
what you expected.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.539
Or maybe you
didn't realize

19:36.570 --> 19:39.403
the duty of calling each
of your 196 wedding guests

19:39.440 --> 19:41.135
and breaking the news

19:41.180 --> 19:43.603
that the KitchenAid Stand
Mixers were theirs to keep

19:43.650 --> 19:45.277
would fall on
the Maid of Honour.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.278
- Chelsea, please!
We talked about this.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.446
- No, it's--

19:49.080 --> 19:51.617
It's OK.
I deserve that.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.483
- See, Jules? We're on
the same page, Josh and 1.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.524
- Well, then, now that
you got in the allotted jab,

19:57.560 --> 20:00.894
we can get down to the business
of brokering peace.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.659
- Absolutely.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.464
To peace.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.467
- To peace.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.229
(Chuckling
nervously)

20:10.170 --> 20:11.569
- It's good to see you.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.169
- Mm-hmm.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.530
- No, I--
I mean it.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.003
I know what it must've
been like when I left,

20:17.040 --> 20:20.101
that Julia wasn't the
only person that I hurt.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.547
I wouldn't have
agreed to come today

20:25.590 --> 20:29.379
if I couldn't look you in the
eye and tell you that I'm sorry.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.656
And I'm not going
anywhere this time, OK?

20:38.270 --> 20:41.296
- Can I get you guys
another glass of wine?

20:41.340 --> 20:45.504
- Actually, I think
we'll take a bottle.

20:45.540 --> 20:47.099
- (Waitress):
Great.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.938
- (Julia): Oh...

20:50.350 --> 20:53.240
- I realize it's
an unorthodox request,

20:53.280 --> 20:56.341
but Suren and I aren't planning
on staying here hidden forever.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.246
It's just until
it's safe to move on.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.316
- Crossing Mother by hiding
the recognized leader of Boston,

21:01.360 --> 21:02.259
her daughter?

21:02.290 --> 21:04.224
It's not a risk
you can expect us to take.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.479
- Word is your purebred trophy
helped you rise

21:06.530 --> 21:08.225
through the ranks
of the Dutch.

21:08.260 --> 21:11.059
- To a well-deserved
seat on the council, yes.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.296
- You enjoying the
perks of your new gig?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.399
I know Hegeman did.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.933
- If you're suggesting
I haven't earned my way...

21:18.970 --> 21:20.199
(Chuckling)

21:20.240 --> 21:22.732
- Oh, come on.
We were both there, Atlee.

21:22.780 --> 21:26.273
But I just wonder how
your brothers would react

21:26.310 --> 21:30.042
to hearing the truth of
how you avenged his death.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.445
- How many are there?
- Four.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.289
- We can't survive!
- Then return to Pennsylvania, coward!

21:34.320 --> 21:36.857
- I'd rather return
a coward than dead!

21:42.060 --> 21:44.290
- I did Mother's bidding.
Look at me.

21:44.330 --> 21:46.219
Hegeman did Mother's
bidding. Look at him.

21:46.270 --> 21:49.831
Have you asked yourself where
Mother was when Hegeman died?

21:51.370 --> 21:54.010
Where Mother was when
you asked for justice?

21:54.040 --> 21:57.135
I was the only one
who stepped up to help you

21:57.180 --> 21:59.046
and what did I do?

21:59.080 --> 22:01.845
I delivered the pelt that
gave you control of the Dutch.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.217
- Let us agree that
I am in your debt, but this--

22:07.250 --> 22:09.787
- This is how
you repay me.

22:09.820 --> 22:11.982
Only this, only now.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.954
Now is the moment
that we settle.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.537
- They'll need convincing.

22:20.570 --> 22:23.335
- Well, it's a good thing
they're your leader.

22:23.370 --> 22:24.440
- And to them,

22:24.470 --> 22:27.405
you are the heretic
loathe to conform to our ways.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.877
(Bird squawking)

22:35.050 --> 22:37.269
- What can I do?

22:37.320 --> 22:39.243
(Sighing)

22:39.290 --> 22:43.056
- They'll be up
soon and hungry.

22:43.090 --> 22:45.457
They'll want
food, fresh food.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.198
- What does that
have to do with me?

22:48.230 --> 22:50.460
- Bring it now.

22:55.570 --> 22:57.334
- What do you
think of the wine?

22:57.370 --> 22:59.429
- Don't start again, Chels.

23:01.310 --> 23:03.847
Cayuga Lake Wine Trails,
senior year?

23:03.880 --> 23:04.904
- Oh, come on!

23:04.950 --> 23:06.270
In my defence,

23:06.310 --> 23:09.348
I didn't have a lot of tasting
experience back then

23:09.380 --> 23:10.916
- Probably because
of the fact

23:10.950 --> 23:13.339
that the name on your fake ID
was Fabio Cortez.

23:13.390 --> 23:15.552
(Laughing)

23:15.590 --> 23:17.922
I'm gonna use the ladies room.
- OK.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.485
- Try not to kill each other.
- Yeah.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.849
- It takes a determined
man to declare

23:22.900 --> 23:25.926
that the water served to cleanse
the palate between tastings

23:25.970 --> 23:29.099
has a refreshing bouquet
of nutmeg and honeysuckle.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.132
- You say "determined”,
I say "drunk”. Mm-hmm.

23:32.170 --> 23:33.399
(Chuckling)

23:36.310 --> 23:37.380
- I'm sorry.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.902
It's just, uh...

23:41.520 --> 23:44.546
this is exactly how
things were a few years ago.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.513
A couple bottles of wine,

23:47.560 --> 23:49.483
Julia with that look
she gets around you,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.579
like you invented
penicillin or Spanx.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.429
- You want me to apologize
for making your friend happy?

23:57.260 --> 23:59.297
- No.

23:59.330 --> 24:01.640
I want you to keep
making her happy.

24:01.670 --> 24:04.503
I need you to keep
making her happy.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.599
- That's why I'm here.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.170
What about you?

24:12.210 --> 24:15.316
- Julia may have wanted
to broker peace,

24:15.350 --> 24:17.409
but I'm here
to warn you, Josh.

24:19.450 --> 24:21.919
You made her happy before,

24:21.960 --> 24:24.224
For a lot of years.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.283
But then all of
a sudden, you were gone.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.992
She almost had
to drop out of med school

24:30.030 --> 24:31.828
because she couldn't
get out of bed in the morning.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.259
I know what this means,

24:37.300 --> 24:40.201
Julia telling me
about the two of you.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.972
It means that
you've won her back.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.379
She's all in.

24:49.220 --> 24:53.179
So if there's anything left

24:54.420 --> 24:58.186
of whatever it is that
came between the two of you,

24:58.230 --> 25:01.951
you're gonna tell her
about it and soon,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.469
Because a 2nd chance
is tough enough.

25:04.500 --> 25:08.596
There's no one left back home
willing to give you a 3rd.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.439
- Well done, you two.
No bloodshed.

25:11.470 --> 25:14.337
And the table's still
upright and everything.

25:14.380 --> 25:17.077
- Sorry, Jules,
but I've gotta take off.

25:17.110 --> 25:19.477
- What? No! We're not
even drunk yet!

25:19.510 --> 25:22.377
- I know! But the traffic
getting out of the city

25:22.420 --> 25:24.411
is gonna be a nightmare, so...

25:24.450 --> 25:27.181
- Aw! OK.

25:28.590 --> 25:31.127
Thanks for coming. Ah!

25:31.160 --> 25:32.321
- Oh!

25:32.360 --> 25:34.158
- Bye.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.491
- Josh.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.768
I'm really glad
we did this.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.165
- Me too.

25:49.710 --> 25:52.202
- "The world will little note
nor never forget

25:52.250 --> 25:53.479
"what we say here

25:53.510 --> 25:57.344
"while it will never forget
what they did here."

25:57.380 --> 25:59.314
Yeah, that is some
deep prose, huh?

25:59.350 --> 26:02.217
You tired of the
great speeches in history?

26:02.260 --> 26:03.682
'Cause I went to
parochial school,

26:03.730 --> 26:06.153
so I know, like,
half of the 154 sonnets

26:06.190 --> 26:09.057
and I got most of
The Canterbury Tales on deck.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.297
- Enough. Uncle, OK?

26:14.940 --> 26:18.467
- Look, I know that I can
never make up for what I did,

26:18.510 --> 26:21.172
but please don't
use that as an excuse

26:21.210 --> 26:23.076
to turn your back
on your gift.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.506
(Children chattering
and giggling)

26:33.720 --> 26:36.109
- Did Chelsea say
something to you?

26:36.160 --> 26:38.083
- Things.
- Aw...

26:38.130 --> 26:40.326
- Several of them.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.954
- She's just protective of me.
It doesn't mean I feel the same.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.321
- Don't you, though?

26:45.370 --> 26:49.637
Isn't there a little part
of you that still wonders...

26:49.670 --> 26:51.468
if you can
really trust me.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.103
- I want to.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.238
And I'm almost there.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.044
We can make it
this time.

26:59.350 --> 27:02.274
You just have to keep
being honest with me.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.484
- What's going on?

27:05.520 --> 27:07.511
- It's an eclipse.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.830
- What the hell?

27:15.330 --> 27:16.695
Oh!

27:16.730 --> 27:20.166
(Whimpering)

27:20.200 --> 27:21.395
Sally, no!

27:23.910 --> 27:25.537
- (Whispering):
Walter.

27:25.570 --> 27:27.368
He's back.

27:27.410 --> 27:31.449
- Julia, there's something--
- Is everything all right?

27:31.480 --> 27:33.369
- I need to tell you
the whole truth.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.178
(Inhaling)

27:37.220 --> 27:39.484
- But you're--
- No!

27:39.520 --> 27:42.114
- Walter!

27:42.160 --> 27:43.252
Walter!

27:46.360 --> 27:47.555
(Clattering)

27:47.590 --> 27:48.557
(Screams)

27:48.600 --> 27:50.489
- Josh, what's
the matter?

27:50.530 --> 27:51.497
What's happening?

27:51.530 --> 27:52.759
You have to
talk to me.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.360
Are you having pain
in your chest?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.266
(Growling)

27:57.300 --> 27:59.132
- (Woman):
What's wrong?

27:59.170 --> 28:00.308
- Josh!

28:00.340 --> 28:01.603
(Whimpering)

28:01.640 --> 28:03.699
(Groaning)

28:03.750 --> 28:05.275
(Roaring)

28:07.250 --> 28:08.570
- Don't just stand there!

28:08.620 --> 28:10.418
We have to help him!

28:10.450 --> 28:12.316
- He's not supposed
to be here, Zoe.

28:12.350 --> 28:14.216
- What? What are
you talking about?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.853
- I--

28:15.890 --> 28:18.723
He's been shredded, Zoe.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.292
I killed him.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.021
- It's the eclipse.
- Why?

28:26.070 --> 28:29.734
- It's something about the
duality of the sun and moon.

28:29.770 --> 28:31.864
It messes with
the order of things.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.629
It skews the planes of
paranormal existence.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.377
When I was a kid,
I went on this field trip

28:37.410 --> 28:39.708
to watch one through
a filtered telescope

28:39.750 --> 28:41.775
and it just
started happening.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.118
Ghosts started appearing.

28:45.250 --> 28:46.843
Walter,

28:46.890 --> 28:48.517
where did
you come from?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.618
- It was here.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.157
Here in the park.

28:52.190 --> 28:53.851
That's where I did it.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.095
Zoe.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.019
I shredded Walter
and he reappears

28:59.070 --> 29:01.562
in the exact
spot that he died.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.059
- Oh my God!

29:07.110 --> 29:09.704
- Nick. He's at my house.

29:09.740 --> 29:10.844
I'll meet you there.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.939
Hurry.

29:16.150 --> 29:17.618
- Nick?

29:17.650 --> 29:19.015
Nick?
- No! No!

29:19.050 --> 29:21.155
- Are you OK?
- No, no, no!

29:21.190 --> 29:23.079
- It's OK.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.054
(Panting)

29:27.900 --> 29:29.891
(Whispering):
Danny!

29:31.270 --> 29:33.159
(Breathing unevenly)

29:34.170 --> 29:36.059
(Grunting)

29:38.210 --> 29:40.065
- Josh!

29:43.210 --> 29:45.008
Josh!

29:45.050 --> 29:47.075
(Breathing unevenly)

29:49.780 --> 29:52.841
- Nick, I am so, so sorry.

29:52.890 --> 29:55.018
Please, please believe me!

29:55.060 --> 29:57.859
It's me, Sally.

29:57.890 --> 29:59.187
(Breathing unevenly)

29:59.230 --> 30:00.550
- Sally?

30:00.590 --> 30:04.060
- Nick, it's OK.
Just hold on, OK?

30:04.100 --> 30:07.695
Keep talking.
Tell me what happened.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.829
- Uh, I was gone.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.100
It all ended,
but only for a moment.

30:18.110 --> 30:20.101
I lost my body.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.644
But my mind, I--

30:23.680 --> 30:25.045
(Breathing unevenly)

30:25.090 --> 30:27.047
I still knew
that I existed,

30:27.090 --> 30:30.116
that somehow
I had survived,

30:30.160 --> 30:34.154
but in another place.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.656
(Sniffling)

30:35.700 --> 30:37.190
- You were somewhere else?

30:37.230 --> 30:38.823
Somewhere better?

30:38.870 --> 30:41.669
Like heaven?

30:42.640 --> 30:43.960
- No.

30:46.240 --> 30:51.110
It's like I'm
trapped forever.

30:52.680 --> 30:56.639
I can see, but there's
nothing to see.

30:58.390 --> 31:02.611
It's some kind of limbo.

31:02.660 --> 31:03.786
(Inhales sharply)

31:03.820 --> 31:06.152
And the pain!

31:06.190 --> 31:08.693
I can't go back, Sally.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.068
(Sniffling, gulping)

31:16.640 --> 31:17.596
(Whimpering)

31:17.640 --> 31:19.699
- Josh!
- Aaah!

31:19.740 --> 31:21.936
- Josh!

31:21.980 --> 31:23.778
(Gasping)

31:23.810 --> 31:25.073
- No, go back!

31:27.050 --> 31:28.973
(Grunting)

31:29.020 --> 31:30.909
No!

31:30.950 --> 31:33.339
(Roaring)

31:35.760 --> 31:36.716
- Whoa!

31:36.760 --> 31:37.716
(Whimpering)

31:37.760 --> 31:39.819
Josh!

31:39.860 --> 31:40.827
(Whimpering)

31:40.860 --> 31:42.225
Josh!

31:42.260 --> 31:44.194
(Panting)

31:44.230 --> 31:45.698
Look at me.

31:47.130 --> 31:48.939
Please!

32:11.660 --> 32:13.651
(Echoing): Josh...

32:20.370 --> 32:22.964
(Groaning)

32:23.970 --> 32:27.235
(Screaming)

32:29.140 --> 32:30.369
(Screams)

32:33.050 --> 32:35.815
(People shouting)

32:35.850 --> 32:36.920
- No, Julia!

32:36.950 --> 32:38.440
(Groaning)

32:38.490 --> 32:40.288
(People talking, indistinct)

32:42.490 --> 32:44.185
(Josh grunting)

32:48.300 --> 32:49.699
(Birds chirping)

32:54.770 --> 32:56.397
(Breathing unevenly)

32:56.440 --> 32:58.738
- You did this
to me, Sally.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.410
You can't make me go back there.
- Nick, I--

33:01.440 --> 33:02.999
- Please!
I need your help!

33:03.040 --> 33:04.747
- I can't!
I don't know how.

33:04.780 --> 33:05.872
- Nick?

33:07.750 --> 33:08.546
- Oh my God!

33:08.580 --> 33:10.719
- I thought I'd
never see you again!

33:10.750 --> 33:12.980
There's a solar eclipse

33:13.020 --> 33:15.455
and wherever you are,
whatever happened to you,

33:15.490 --> 33:18.790
I think its energy
is merging our 2 planes.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.082
- How much time
do we have?

33:20.130 --> 33:22.258
- I don't know.
Maybe a few minutes.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.268
I got here as
fast as I could.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.790
(Sniffling)

33:27.830 --> 33:29.468
- Sally?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.969
You sure are a sight
for sore eyes.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.469
- Me? Wow.

33:35.510 --> 33:38.275
It must really
be bad in there.

33:38.310 --> 33:42.747
- It's so bad, it's like you
knew where you were sending me.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.782
(Sniffling)

33:44.820 --> 33:46.788
- Nick, I need to know.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.812
You have to tell me
where you are right now.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.225
I mean, are you OK?

33:51.990 --> 33:54.220
I just need
to hear the truth.

33:54.260 --> 33:59.096
- Zoe, you are the first
thing since I died,

33:59.130 --> 34:03.089
the first thing
that made sense.

34:05.370 --> 34:07.304
You saved me.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.009
But, uh...

34:18.120 --> 34:20.748
Now I'm at peace.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.024
And I think I'm in
a better place.

34:28.060 --> 34:31.052
So you don't have to
worry about me anymore.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.295
(Crying)

34:37.199 --> 34:39.339
- Is everybody there like you?

34:40.510 --> 34:41.978
Were they all--

34:42.010 --> 34:43.239
- Shredded?

34:45.179 --> 34:47.376
No, not all.

34:49.920 --> 34:53.288
Some of them just went
through the wrong door.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.288
And others...

34:55.320 --> 34:56.856
(Sighing)

34:56.889 --> 34:58.483
Well, let's just
say, limbo --

34:58.530 --> 35:00.783
That's what
we're calling it --

35:02.030 --> 35:04.192
has its share
of undesirables.

35:04.230 --> 35:07.427
But who are
we kidding, Sally?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.830
It's nothing
I don't deserve.

35:20.110 --> 35:22.340
(Shuddering)

35:31.160 --> 35:33.288
- I miss you so much.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.261
I never thought
I'd be so happy

35:38.300 --> 35:40.894
to get a chance
to say goodbye to someone.

35:49.110 --> 35:51.078
(Shuddering)

36:02.320 --> 36:04.049
- Goodbye.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.120
I won't forget you.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.496
(Sniffling)

36:23.140 --> 36:24.869
(Crying)

36:26.680 --> 36:28.148
- Are you OK?

36:28.180 --> 36:30.239
(Sniffling)

36:35.320 --> 36:37.379
- It doesn't matter.

36:40.230 --> 36:42.289
Nick is OK.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.522
So...

36:48.670 --> 36:50.695
I will be too.

36:56.310 --> 36:58.404
Thank you.

37:14.460 --> 37:15.621
- Suren, I--

37:15.660 --> 37:19.164
** T've been living like this

37:19.200 --> 37:21.339
* For a long time

37:24.310 --> 37:27.564
* Fumbling towards you

37:27.610 --> 37:30.272
* In the dark

37:32.550 --> 37:35.679
* I can't go on

37:35.720 --> 37:39.088
* In this way forever

37:41.290 --> 37:43.054
- Mother?

37:43.090 --> 37:45.730
* Won't you call out to me?
Call me now *

37:45.760 --> 37:47.057
You were right.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.024
This is where I belong.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.564
(Woman talking, indistinct)

37:59.610 --> 38:02.204
(People talking, indistinct)

38:06.750 --> 38:07.740
- (Man): No, sir.
I live here.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.179
(Man on CB, indistinct)

38:09.220 --> 38:10.210
- Julia.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.388
Oh, thank God you're--

38:19.460 --> 38:21.019
(Sighing)

38:33.110 --> 38:34.635
- What...

38:38.180 --> 38:39.648
What are you?

38:39.680 --> 38:41.444
- I'm a wolf.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.343
A werewolf.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.949
- Why didn't
you tell me?

38:50.990 --> 38:51.855
- I couldn't!

38:51.890 --> 38:53.255
(Sniffling)

38:54.860 --> 38:56.498
I didn't know how.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.393
After I found out...

39:06.070 --> 39:08.471
when I was turned...

39:11.310 --> 39:14.143
the life I knew
before ended.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.314
The person I was died.

39:21.490 --> 39:24.118
I didn't want you
to have to face that.

39:27.430 --> 39:29.250
I thought you
were better off.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.257
I was trying
to protect you.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.236
I will protect you...

39:43.280 --> 39:44.645
from this.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.909
I still can.

39:46.910 --> 39:49.117
- No, Josh,
you can't.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.641
It's too late.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.146
(Sobs)

40:23.680 --> 40:25.387
(Crying)

40:26.650 --> 40:28.459
- I'm so--

40:30.820 --> 40:33.152
I'm so sorry.

40:35.460 --> 40:37.349
- This was the reason...

40:38.360 --> 40:39.862
all along...

40:41.270 --> 40:43.034
why you left me.

40:45.470 --> 40:47.609
(Sighing)

40:47.640 --> 40:52.202
** He gave us sheets
made of felt

40:54.250 --> 40:58.312
* Tonight we're not alone

40:58.350 --> 41:03.356
<i>* I am not scared</i>

41:03.390 --> 41:05.256
What is it?

41:10.500 --> 41:12.389
- It's for you.

41:12.430 --> 41:17.391
* Out through the door
of his office

41:18.670 --> 41:22.402
* You love him
I'm all alone

41:22.440 --> 41:24.329
It's OK.

41:24.380 --> 41:29.375
* Covered in gold

41:31.690 --> 41:35.615
* Oh

41:38.320 --> 41:41.699
* Oh

41:41.730 --> 41:44.324
* Oh, oh, oh

41:44.360 --> 41:47.796
* Oh, oh

41:47.830 --> 41:49.696
- I loved you enough, Josh.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.902
* Oh

41:51.940 --> 41:54.261
You just never believed it.

41:54.310 --> 41:57.007
* Oh, oh, oh

41:57.040 --> 42:01.250
* Oh

42:03.050 --> 42:07.385
* The good doctor
he loves Delphia

42:09.060 --> 42:13.884
* Now that I'm gone
I can know

42:13.930 --> 42:18.925
<i>* I was so wrong</i>

42:21.740 --> 42:26.610
* Ooh

42:28.370 --> 42:33.399
* You died knowing
he'll bury you

42:34.480 --> 42:38.314
* Next to your love
in the ground

42:38.350 --> 42:40.318
* We'll be parked

42:40.350 --> 42:45.322
* Underground *
