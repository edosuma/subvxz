WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:05.665
If you do not challenge the corrupt,
then commoners will rise.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.387
Truro lacks an MP.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.984
Sir Francis intends to put up his own candidate
to challenge Falmouth's.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.422
I regret I must decline.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.669
R055: He
won?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.740
Your stubbornness will be your undoing.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.547
Is it wrong to hope for love in a marriage?

00:17.720 --> 00:19.620
Does Mr Whitworth's love mean nothing at all?

00:19.800 --> 00:20.869
Close your eyes and submit.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.780
- No, please!
- Mm-hm.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.825
I'm no Leonardo but you are surely Mona Lisa.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.309
Since the day of her death
he's been icy towards me.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.586
- What does he imagine?
- That Valentine is not his child.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.224
Secret kisses? How many other secrets
must there be between us?

00:36.400 --> 00:39.745
You will never again
speak such vile suspicions

00:39.920 --> 00:42.024
- about your wife and child!
- I swear it.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.020
I believe I have every reason for optimism.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.781
What is it you believe?

00:45.960 --> 00:49.418
Do not ask me for a kiss

00:50.000 --> 00:53.902
Life is short but love is long

00:54.080 --> 00:56.139
In six months' time I'll be completely blind.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.026
Shall we grant ourselves to each other?

00:58.200 --> 01:01.579
- Demelza...
- No, Ross. Ask me nothing.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.260
(Woman laughs)

01:58.600 --> 02:00.579
(Echoing) What is love?

02:01.640 --> 02:04.097
A possession to be hoarded...

02:04.280 --> 02:06.384
or a blessing to be given away?

02:07.080 --> 02:10.459
Did she betray her love for you
by offering some to me?

02:13.280 --> 02:18.217
Can I not give him
even the smallest piece of my heart?

02:35.960 --> 02:38.144
(Laughter)

02:40.960 --> 02:42.222
Papa!

02:44.960 --> 02:46.939
Papa!

02:55.240 --> 02:57.219
We saw you swim away.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.669
No. I'm still here.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.059
And I.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.342
My Right Honourable friends,

03:59.520 --> 04:04.901
I have to inform you that it is my intention
to ask permission of His Majesty the King

04:05.080 --> 04:06.866
to call for an election.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.066
-(Shouﬁng)
- Order! Order!

04:10.680 --> 04:13.023
Order! Order!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.945
(Lively chatter)

04:31.440 --> 04:33.021
Where's the grain bound for?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.667
Lisbon.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.459
(Chatter nearby)

04:43.080 --> 04:46.060
So there it is.
Pitt's dissolved Parliament.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.559
And called an election.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.907
In which I have every intention
of ousting your man here

04:52.080 --> 04:53.547
by putting forward my nephew.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.540
I humbly invite you to try, my Lord.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.920
(Fire crackling)

05:39.880 --> 05:41.859
HUGH: Ups to my //,'05 unfold

05:42.760 --> 05:44.739
The tale of our /0 V6 is told

05:45.600 --> 05:47.579
Hal/owed by sea and sand

05:48.320 --> 05:50.026
Beauty was in my hand.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.181
(Groans softly)

06:05.320 --> 06:09.825
My dear, I hope the gifts
I brought from London found favour?

06:10.240 --> 06:12.902
Valentine has not been used to such kindness.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.981
- He welcomes the change.
- It will continue.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.859
So I would hope.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.339
And were we ever to be blessed
with another child...

06:29.080 --> 06:31.059
You have my word.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.139
Things will be different.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.539
I am now different.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.902
Ah, the prodigal returns!

06:53.600 --> 06:55.386
Jago, boy, come here!

06:56.320 --> 06:57.389
All right, Da?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.107
What 'ee been up to now, son?

06:59.280 --> 07:03.944
Ah, the usual. Brawling, free-trading,
attacking customs officials.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.860
Have you both heard?

07:06.040 --> 07:08.543
Wheal Kitty's closed.
And Jane and Busy.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.780
- Since when?
- Since after banks in Truro shut they doors.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.383
- Mines can't draw wages.
- These are uncertain times.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.902
Pitt's called an election.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.219
If the Bank of England's
suspended its payments,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.027
some local banks will do the same.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.942
- But hopefully it's temporary.
- And meantime?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.827
Are we to eat?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.820
The price of grain is off the scale

07:28.000 --> 07:31.379
and at Truro quay today I see'd it
being shipped away to Lisbon.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.539
Be that lawful?

07:34.920 --> 07:36.785
Quite the reverse.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.303
But many still sell to the highest bidder.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.465
(Hums) Love Is Long

07:59.520 --> 08:01.499
Pretty song, that. What it be?

08:03.440 --> 08:06.000
It's... It's just something I heard.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.899
I can't recall where.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.747
There does appear to be
some slight improvement.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.145
My uncle will be delighted.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.346
He's asked me to stand at Truro
for the next election.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.980
As second choice.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.383
You know he asked Ross first.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.859
I seem to recall you saying
that politics was not to your taste.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.543
Well, perhaps my priorities have changed.

08:57.800 --> 09:02.021
So, you think, with the aid of spectacles,
I'll be able to see to the other side of the House.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.499
There have been Members
who are not all-seeing.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.897
(Laughs)

09:08.840 --> 09:11.024
- (Jeremy yells)
- (Demelza laughs)

09:12.800 --> 09:14.904
That one nearly got me!

09:16.320 --> 09:19.266
That was a big one.
(Jeremy continues chattering)

09:20.960 --> 09:22.621
Your worst nightmare...

09:22.800 --> 09:25.621
- Cold feet?
- Shrieking children.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.983
True.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.617
And though some things
one can learn to tolerate,

09:30.960 --> 09:33.064
cold feet is not one of them.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.027
Children are no guarantee of happiness.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.179
As Ross will testify.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.182
Ross! I think we must go.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.662
Demelza, we must leave now
or we'll be late for the service.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.860
Do you not think, wife,

10:11.040 --> 10:16.342
that the time has come for_us to resume our...
conjugal bliss?

10:17.040 --> 10:19.258
What bliss was that, Osborne?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.540
This is wilfulness.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.468
Neglect.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.540
So, help me, a man has needs.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.180
A wife has duties.

10:30.360 --> 10:34.581
Which I fulfilled in every way
till you saw fit to debauch my sister.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.937
I'm expected at Sawle.
Naturally, you'll not wish to attend.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.621
Miss Agatha was kind to me.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.781
I wish very much to attend.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.621
Friends,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.984
fellow servants of God,

11:09.680 --> 11:13.980
we are gathered here today,
at the behest of Mistress Warleggan,

11:14.160 --> 11:17.937
to honour the life of Agatha Mary Poldark.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.940
How fortunate was that great lady

11:21.120 --> 11:25.341
to have known in her lifetime
such esteem and devotion...

11:26.000 --> 11:30.187
...and in death to be spared the turmoil
and strife which now threatens us all.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.541
War with France. An election looming?

11:34.240 --> 11:36.697
Disorder and riot at every turn.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.587
How blessed are they that have
passed through the Vale of Tears

11:39.760 --> 11:43.184
and now lie down in flowery fields
beside the Lamb of God!

11:43.360 --> 11:45.464
- Praise be.
MOURNERS: Amen.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.020
"Disorder and riot."_
Do we hear rumours of such In Truro?

11:52.200 --> 11:55.499
Nothing that won't be quelled
by a firm response from our magistrates.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.187
If the situation worsens,
you will of course not hesitate...

12:00.240 --> 12:01.787
...to read the Riot Act.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.439
Oh, no, no.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.057
Indeed. Elizabeth.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.943
Your presence today was appreciated.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.907
I regret it took so long to supply a headstone.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.264
It was not for want of affection for her.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.900
At least not on your part.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.386
I feel we should be going, wife.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.262
Captain Poldark, I wonder,
since we are so close to Nampara,

12:57.440 --> 12:59.783
whether my wife and I
might wait upon you today.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.860
We'd be delighted to receive you.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.507
Would we not, Demelza?

13:05.080 --> 13:07.298
- (Clucking)
- Judas, I could crown Ross!

13:07.480 --> 13:10.301
He could hardly refuse.
Sir Francis seemed most eager.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.620
You don't understand. My father
and brothers worked in his mines.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.506
Now he'll be under my roof.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.864
Do you suppose
he'll send you to eat in the scullery?

13:18.040 --> 13:19.302
I think I'd prefer it.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.699
Prudie! Oh, Prudie, make haste!

13:22.880 --> 13:24.507
Oh, Judas, clear the table.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.946
Sir Francis Basset is coming to tea.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.668
Well, what do we have?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.819
Cakes, tarts, jellies?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.265
Has there been any disturbance hereabouts?

13:56.440 --> 13:58.021
We passed people on the road to Truro.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.385
My clear,
the vulgars are full of sound and fury.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.302
But, believe me,
they would not dare take things further.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.379
HUGH: My beloved Demelza,

14:15.560 --> 14:18.700
this poem must suﬁ‘ice
to reside next to your heart;

14:18.880 --> 14:20.586
where I most long to be.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.064
Brave of you to venture into enemy territory,
my Lord,

14:25.520 --> 14:27.340
given that George Warleggan is your man.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.897
Well, he's shortly to be challenged
by a new candidate.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.820
Falmouth's nephew.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.547
Armitage?

14:33.720 --> 14:34.823
I'd not heard.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.662
Oh, sir, we b'aint quite ready.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.300
Mistress is above. No need to go up.
She'll be down directly.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.707
Sir.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.345
Lios to my //,'05 unfo/o’

14:51.520 --> 14:53.226
The tale of our /0 ye is told

14:53.400 --> 14:55.106
Today has been all I could wish.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.464
Hal/owed by sea and sand

14:57.640 --> 15:00.279
I beg you, never speak of this again.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.819
Beauty was in my hand.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.387
ROSS: Demelza! Our guests have arrived.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.299
- Where are they going?
- Truro quay,

15:28.480 --> 15:30.619
to see for theyselves
if what I say it true.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.505
Corn snatched from the mouths of our babes?

15:33.680 --> 15:37.423
Sent to feed Portuguese dandies.
And if it's true, then what?

15:38.360 --> 15:39.861
You'll not turn back the tide.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.019
Someone should.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.019
Jagg!

15:48.800 --> 15:49.824
Jagg!

15:50.000 --> 15:52.457
Curse the lad!
There never was no argufying with him.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.779
I'll go. I have longer legs.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.960
Fear not. We'll fetch him home again.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.139
Jagg!

16:08.880 --> 16:11.986
Come away, brother.
'Tis a fool's errand.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.219
No-one asked 'ee to come along with I.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.979
Go home if 'ee choose.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.464
My Lord de Dunstanville, is life much altered
by your elevation to the peerage?

16:33.640 --> 16:37.269
Oh, not in the least. My dogs are as lazy
and my daughter as wilful.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.702
(Laughter)

16:38.880 --> 16:41.257
Will you be less embroiled in
more mundane matters of state?

16:41.440 --> 16:46.218
Alas, no. I fear I'll be called upon all the more
to pronounce judgment and enforce order.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.459
Particularly in these unruly times.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.338
(Bell ringing)

16:52.640 --> 16:54.301
There she be!

16:54.480 --> 16:56.664
- And that's the grain!
- (Angry shouting)

16:56.840 --> 17:01.140
When merchants flout the law and send
graIn abroad while people at home starve,

17:01.320 --> 17:02.742
who will enforce that order?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.627
(Shouting and groaning)

17:06.720 --> 17:07.823
No...

17:08.000 --> 17:09.501
- Here, stop that!
-(Shouﬁng)

17:09.680 --> 17:12.581
Those in governance
who feel strongly about it.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.865
Get back!

17:20.120 --> 17:21.781
No!

17:22.520 --> 17:24.226
Please stop! Argh!

17:30.280 --> 17:31.622
(Thud)

17:33.960 --> 17:37.259
I believe there are men of honour
and conVIctIon, my Lord.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.504
If one did know where to look.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.104
When one does, you'll often find
such men reluctant to step up.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.760
And now, regrettably,
the moment has passed.

17:47.920 --> 17:52.061
While other candidates serve not so much
the borough but theIr own end.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.782
And Falmouth has a new man
to challenge George.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.383
- His nephew.
DWIGHT: He's accepted the nomination?

17:58.560 --> 18:01.347
He's a good man.
And Westminster has need of good men.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.705
If he wins against the combined forces
of Basset and Warleggan.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.859
That seems unlikely.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.899
(Angry shouting)

18:21.040 --> 18:24.464
This feud between the Poldarks
and the Warleggans,

18:24.640 --> 18:26.107
it should be buried.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.306
Especially in a time of war
when we have a common enemy to fight.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.141
You tell Captain Poldark, will you?

18:31.320 --> 18:34.300
- (Chuckles) If you will tell Mr Warleggan.
- Ah.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.261
- And what of your own feud?
- Of mine?

18:38.440 --> 18:40.499
- With Lord Falmouth.
- Ah.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.240
Is it not a pity that you cannot
agree on a candidate

18:43.400 --> 18:45.265
instead of fighting each other for the seat?

18:45.440 --> 18:48.705
So we might both throw our weight
behind a handsome and poetic war hero?

18:49.840 --> 18:53.662
You think him a fitting substitute
for the man I first favoured?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.985
In every way but one, my Lord.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.105
My husband does not write poetry.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.417
(Chuckles)

19:04.000 --> 19:07.185
Jago Martin did murder a merchant
with his own bare hands.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.702
And the Came brothers with him?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.825
I seen them all three together.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.697
Amongst 2,000 filthy rioters.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.100
2,000 miners descended on Truro.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.703
- 2,000?
- An exaggeration, surely?

19:20.880 --> 19:23.701
Apparently it was too dangerous
to even attempt to read the Riot Act.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.347
I must return to Tehidy at once.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.819
Landowners and squires will be summoned
immediately, yourselves included.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.707
- To what end?
- Immediate re-establishment of law and order.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.657
- May I ask who sent the note?
- The Honourable Member for Truro.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.099
(Clears his throat)

19:47.000 --> 19:49.184
I've had men stationed at all the gates.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.747
With the mood in town,
one cannot be too careful.

19:56.480 --> 20:00.257
I'm thinking particularly of your peace of mind,
my dear.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.862
Especially now, if we're considering
an addition to the family.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.623
And Valentine
would hardly wish to see his father's head

20:07.800 --> 20:10.064
paraded on a spike round Truro quay.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.466
Gentlemen, events today on Truro quay

20:19.640 --> 20:22.666
leave us no choice_ _
but to act SWIftly and decrsrvely.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.025
I hope I may rely on you all
in rounding up the offenders

20:26.200 --> 20:28.760
to prevent any thought of reoccurrence.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.919
Sir John, may I ask you
to take the village of St Ann's

20:35.080 --> 20:36.581
and arrest the following persons?

20:36.760 --> 20:40.025
My Lord, are there any from Sawle
among the accused?

20:41.720 --> 20:43.699
There are.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.741
Dr Enys and I will arrest them.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.779
Mr Stackhouse, the village of Poole.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.265
(Fire crackling)

21:08.640 --> 21:10.267
(Low gas-P)

21:16.600 --> 21:18.864
(Chatter)

21:20.040 --> 21:22.019
(Silence)

21:28.280 --> 21:31.226
There was a riot today on Truro quay.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.160
Charges relating to it are as follows:

21:34.920 --> 21:37.502
theft, violent affray,

21:37.680 --> 21:39.705
common assault,

21:39.880 --> 21:41.939
- murder.
- Murder?

21:42.120 --> 21:46.147
One Samuel Phillips. A com merchant.
There were witnesses.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.742
When I call out your name,

21:47.920 --> 21:51.424
you will kindly step forward
before you are taken to Truro jail.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.160
- Can 'ee not let 'em go?
- It is not in my power to do so.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.743
Believe me, you'd sooner deal with Ross

21:56.920 --> 21:59.821
than the thugs who'll be breaking down doors
from hereto Truro.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.664
You have my word, I will do all in my power
to see you are fairly dealt with.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.149
All in your power? What power's that?

22:07.320 --> 22:08.503
MAN: Aye.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.989
The names are as follows.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.062
John Hoskin.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.427
Peter Hoskin.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.680
- Jago Martin.
- (Murmuring)

22:21.400 --> 22:23.379
Samuel Carne.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.300
Drake Came.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.662
- We never did nothing.
SAM: Brother, swear to God,

22:28.840 --> 22:30.580
we never stole,
we never made assault.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.103
If you are innocent,
you have nothing to fear.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.264
I will vouch for you in court tomorrow.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.583
(Signs)

22:42.440 --> 22:44.180
Say naught of this to Sister.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.748
How can I keep it from her?

22:45.920 --> 22:48.866
You swear,
they who be innocent shall be free?

22:51.680 --> 22:52.817
Yes.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.460
Then it profit her not to know we're arrested
when tomorrow we'll be free again.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.463
(Honking)

23:29.240 --> 23:31.299
Was it very bad?

23:32.440 --> 23:33.543
Yes.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.219
No. I must go out again.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.107
There were arrests.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.259
Men are due in court at midday.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.019
What can I do?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.899
Lie with me awhile.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.019
I must go.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.099
Keep home today.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.820
There's unrest in the villages.
I would have you safe.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.944
My dear, I'm just leaving for the court.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.621
Was not the trial at midday?

24:32.800 --> 24:34.859
Oh, I ordered it to be brought forward.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.941
Best to have such matters
resolved early In the day.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.341
(He makes an animal noise)

24:47.600 --> 24:51.024
- Could it be true?
- Sam and Drake claim they're innocent.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.782
Jago throttled a corn merchant
but swears he left him alive.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.499
Reliable witnesses?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.945
Those in the pay of
the Honourable Member for Truro.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.418
You think George is behind the charges?

25:04.600 --> 25:06.181
7'0 Drake, 5am and Jags?

25:06.360 --> 25:07.941
Without question.

25:08.120 --> 25:12.625
- Such a man is our Member of Parliament?
- Until Hugh defeats him at the election.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.097
(Clears his throat)

25:16.280 --> 25:17.986
In truth, I think Hugh a good man.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.506
Pity we'll see so little of him
if he goes to Westminster.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.342
He'll be absent from Cornwall
for most of the year.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.144
(Chains rattling)

25:46.040 --> 25:47.860
(He chuckles softly)

25:54.680 --> 25:56.500
Where is everyone?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.545
Captain Ross, Dr Enys and the rest?

25:58.720 --> 26:00.699
Captain Ross did say he'd be here.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.945
- Mr Ross gone to Truro?
- No peace for the wicked.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.139
I think maybe he's not that wicked.

26:16.560 --> 26:21.429
Indeed, I clearly wish I'd never telled 'ee
what I saw that day at Sawle church.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.099
Prudie...

26:27.400 --> 26:29.664
It...'twas not on that account that I...

26:31.920 --> 26:34.059
...that Hugh and I...

26:37.880 --> 26:41.509
Indeed, I can scarce account
for what happened at all.

26:44.120 --> 26:48.625
All I know is, a handsome young poet

26:48.800 --> 26:51.780
beguiled me...and I him.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.945
And we shared...a moment...

26:58.520 --> 27:00.499
...then parted.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.259
And that's the end of it.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.019
Prisoners, the court will now move
to place sentencing upon you.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.739
You who stand here today
guilty of riotous assembly...

27:21.920 --> 27:24.627
know that the full rigour of the law
must be applied...

27:24.800 --> 27:26.119
They've already been tried.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.864
...and would surely be so were it not
for the plea made on your behalf

27:30.040 --> 27:31.746
by my Lord de Dunstanville.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.103
It would appear so.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.067
George must have arranged
for the hearing to be brought forward.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.220
In consideration of which,
you will forthwith be released.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.379
(Relieved sighs)

27:42.280 --> 27:46.944
You who have been found guilty of more
serious crimes can expect no such mercy.

27:47.120 --> 27:51.068
Examples must be set,
a clear message sent out

27:51.240 --> 27:54.380
so that others considering
a repeat of these transgressions

27:54.560 --> 27:56.983
may know what lies in store for them.

27:58.320 --> 28:03.303
Michael Penhale,
Mark Pinner, John Hoskin...

28:03.480 --> 28:06.347
you are sentenced
to seven years' transportation.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.226
(Muttering)

28:10.400 --> 28:12.379
Jago Martin,

28:12.560 --> 28:14.221
Samuel Came,

28:14.400 --> 28:15.742
Drake Came,

28:15.920 --> 28:19.139
you will be taken from this court to prison...

28:20.040 --> 28:24.022
...and thence to a place of execution
where you will be hanged from the neck

28:24.200 --> 28:26.179
- until you be dead.
- No!

28:27.680 --> 28:28.704
(Grunting)

28:28.880 --> 28:30.268
(Sam mutters a prayer)

28:30.440 --> 28:32.419
Get back in line!

28:38.000 --> 28:40.343
DWIGHT: Ross, come away.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.381
Ross.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.425
Divine justice has spoken.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.900
Following the riots of last night,
three miserable souls will hang.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.227
- I pity them.
- Do not.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.504
They are criminals of the vilest kind.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.941
I shall urge them to repent
as they mount the scaffold.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.907
- But since they are Methodists...
- Methodists?

29:05.400 --> 29:06.822
Do you know their names?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.422
Nor do I wish to.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.977
It's bad enough that I must pray for their souls.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.899
(Breathes tensely)

29:25.040 --> 29:27.019
(Chains rattling)

29:27.960 --> 29:29.985
(Lock clunks and echoes)

29:49.920 --> 29:51.899
HUGH: tins to my //,'05 unfo/o’

29:53.160 --> 29:55.185
The tale of our /0 ye is told

29:56.040 --> 29:58.179
Hal/oweo' by sea and sand

29:59.040 --> 30:01.019
(Fades) Beauty was in my hand.

30:07.200 --> 30:11.705
Since his mother died, he turned wild
and would never mind me.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.744
- (Sobs)
- I know.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.789
- Courage, brother.
- Will you humour me?

30:26.520 --> 30:30.263
Go to Nampara and swear Prudie to silence.

30:30.880 --> 30:35.067
Invite Demelza to dinner and keep her
by any means from hearing this.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.707
For how long?

30:36.880 --> 30:38.859
Till I send word.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.339
(Neighing)

30:57.280 --> 30:58.861
(Moans)

30:59.040 --> 31:01.019
(Groans)

31:05.120 --> 31:07.099
Is something amiss?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.306
A slight headache, Uncle.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.459
I think I may have caught a chill.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.859
Shall I send for Dr Choake?

31:14.280 --> 31:17.659
No need. I've invited Dr Enys
and his wife to visit tomorrow.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.740
A social call but...

31:19.920 --> 31:22.423
if the headache persists,
I will ask his advice.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.782
Clearly there are many matters
requiring their attention

31:33.960 --> 31:36.906
beyond the arrangements
for your return to Parliament.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.305
Ah, Captain Poldark, I'm informed you
wish to see me on a matter of urgency.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.143
Ross, we were discussing arrangements
for the coming election.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.741
Pitt hopes to strengthen his hand
against those who oppose him.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.582
But his handling of the war
and the current financial crisis

31:54.760 --> 31:56.739
leaves his position in serious doubt.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.423
And what of his bill to help the poor?

32:00.160 --> 32:01.900
Pensions for the old, parish loans?

32:02.080 --> 32:06.267
Well meant but utterly impractical
and opposed by most men in authority.

32:06.440 --> 32:10.137
- Particularly those versed in law.
- But not sufficiently versed in compassion?

32:10.320 --> 32:14.381
Had you entered Parliament, you might
have argued passionately in favour of that bill.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.301
I think the primary objective of Parliament now
is to win the war.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.586
The sure way of doing that
would be to prevent disaffection at home.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.546
We have our own ways of doing that.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.541
As the men sentenced to hang
will shortly attest.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.029
There was nothing more to be done for them.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.657
- The evidence against them was...
- Largely manufactured

32:33.840 --> 32:36.263
and in the case of my brothers-in-law,
entirely so.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.989
They were part of a riot. They were present
when crimes were committed.

32:40.160 --> 32:44.039
And the act of one is the act of all.
You of all people should know that.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.586
You surely see
that an example must be made.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.342
And the harsher the lesson,
the greater the deterrent.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.387
We are talking about men's lives.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.983
Sometimes a man's life is what is required

32:59.160 --> 33:02.027
in order_ to deter others
from followmg In hIs footsteps.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.306
Many a man has been reprieved
at the foot of the scaffold.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.104
We both know who has the power
to make it so.

33:19.880 --> 33:23.782
From Hugh. Will I attend on him
at Tregothnan tomorrow?

33:25.200 --> 33:26.781
Is he unwell?

33:26.960 --> 33:30.737
He says he wants to reassure his uncle
that he's fit to stand for Parliament...

33:33.320 --> 33:36.869
...and urges Caroline
and you and Ross to join me.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.859
Oh.

33:50.840 --> 33:53.866
- (Water dripping)
- Will he bring Sister, do 'ee think?

33:58.120 --> 34:00.259
For her sake, let him not.

34:10.600 --> 34:13.387
Mistress be back. She be indoors.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.979
Does she suspect?

34:17.280 --> 34:19.544
- (She sobs)
- (He sighs)

34:28.320 --> 34:30.299
Ross...

34:31.120 --> 34:32.826
What happened in court?

34:33.640 --> 34:35.619
Some were treated fairly,

34:36.520 --> 34:38.499
others harshly.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.341
What's in the letter?

34:41.520 --> 34:43.499
It's from Hugh.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.538
Inviting us to Tregothnan tomorrow.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.179
Along with Dwight and Caroline.

34:58.880 --> 35:03.101
His letter speaks of a fever.
Of headaches and the like.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.864
I think... I think it would be
a kindness to visit.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.099
A kindness, yes.

35:15.480 --> 35:19.587
Do you think there's room...
in a woman's heart for two men?

35:22.440 --> 35:24.419
Or two women in a man's?

35:33.080 --> 35:35.059
No husband minds his wife...

35:36.120 --> 35:39.419
...being the one that other men desire but...

35:43.520 --> 35:46.580
...no man wants his wife to be
the one that other men possess.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.665
No, Ross.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.778
So, tomorrow, I have further business
regarding the arrests in Truro.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.339
But you...

36:04.280 --> 36:06.419
You go to Tregothnan.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.379
If you think I should.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.139
I do.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.026
(Rope sliding)

36:52.480 --> 36:54.459
(Rope sliding)

37:03.320 --> 37:05.584
(Voice echoes) Drake.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.578
(Thudding)
- (GaspIng)

37:17.320 --> 37:19.345
(Rope creaking)

37:19.520 --> 37:21.704
(Low chatter)

37:21.880 --> 37:23.859
(Children giggling)

37:25.360 --> 37:27.499
She have a right to know.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.699
She'd wish to be there.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.059
Have you ever been at a hanging?

37:34.240 --> 37:35.787
No.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.099
Well, the spectacle is hideous.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.145
I will at least spare her
the horror of witnessing it.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.020
A visit to Tregothnan will keep her occupied.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.623
But if they hang and she not there?

37:57.200 --> 37:59.179
It will destroy her.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.499
And she'll never forgive me.

38:06.320 --> 38:10.541
Still...it's the lesser of two evils.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.540
GEORGE: I take it you won't be joining me
at the execution?

38:39.720 --> 38:41.779
Who's to hang?
Did you tell me their names?

38:44.480 --> 38:47.904
No matter. I think I'll stay here
and prepare for our return to London.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.979
Oh.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.901
Then...you...you will, after all,
be accompanying me?

38:57.480 --> 38:59.744
Of late I'd assumed you'd remain here.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.387
I thought so too.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.586
But on reflection I think it beneficial
if we are not so much apart.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.147
Welcome. Do come in.

39:35.320 --> 39:38.869
DWIGHT: Shall we adjourn briefly?
HUGH: Yes, thank you.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.019
(Fire crackling)

39:54.560 --> 39:56.539
This nomination...

39:57.960 --> 40:00.542
Are you quite certain
you feel strong enough?

40:01.520 --> 40:03.021
Why would you doubt it?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.179
Your time in France.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.860
It will have taken its toll.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.385
The conditions which you and I endured,

40:13.560 --> 40:17.109
there will always be a fragility
that was not there before.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.787
In what regard?

40:19.960 --> 40:22.019
You may be prone to febrile conditions,

40:22.200 --> 40:24.179
palpitations, headaches.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.939
Have you experienced any of these?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.419
Not that I can recall.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.219
Possibly the odd headache.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.259
(Men and women singing)

40:40.440 --> 40:42.419
(Singing and lively chatter)

40:49.280 --> 40:50.986
(Chatter continues)

40:55.400 --> 40:59.666
- Would you wish to be so close?
- Nay, Ross, I was there at his beginning.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.819
I must be there at his end.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.739
Ladies. Oh, please...

41:13.080 --> 41:18.063
Dr Enys, I trust you'll have my nephew
in perfect health by the election.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.300
I need a vigorous young candidate
to oust Basset's man.

41:21.480 --> 41:26.463
Perfect health is difficult for any to attain
and I don't think Hugh is likely to achieve it.

41:26.640 --> 41:29.939
However, I hope second best
will be sufficient for the electors of Truro.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.464
Imagine if you did attain the seat.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.949
I've attained so much already...

41:36.120 --> 41:38.099
for which I am eternally grateful.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.019
(Bell tolling)

42:15.760 --> 42:17.341
My Lord, I...

42:18.040 --> 42:20.941
I wonder, would you consider a truce
with Sir Francis,

42:21.120 --> 42:23.099
erm, with my Lord de Dunstanville?

42:28.920 --> 42:32.060
So that you need not fight each other
over the Truro seat

42:32.240 --> 42:36.745
but unite to find a new candidate
who'd have the people's Interests at heart?

42:36.920 --> 42:40.185
- Well, that would make perfect sense.
- But for one fact.

42:40.360 --> 42:43.181
The arrogant young peer
would certainly not compromise.

42:43.360 --> 42:48.900
I think... That is, I believe he might, my Lord.
Indeed, he lately said so to me.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.138
You ladies are so easily played upon.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.302
I recollect it was Basset who enabled
Warleggan's entry to the House In the ﬁrst place.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.417
When you've been in the world as long as I,
you know a conniving rogue when you see one.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.265
(Door is opened)

43:05.440 --> 43:07.943
Samuel Came, Drake Came,

43:08.120 --> 43:10.702
you have been found guilty of violent assault

43:10.880 --> 43:13.906
and of stealing goods
above the value of 40 shillings.

43:14.680 --> 43:21.427
Jago Martin, you have been found guilty of
the murder of Samuel Phillips, corn merchant.

43:22.120 --> 43:25.066
Have you anything to say
before your sentence is carried out?

43:37.440 --> 43:39.465
Fnends”.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.941
...beloved family...

43:45.280 --> 43:48.829
...know that if I've wronged you in this life
I now beg forgiveness.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.982
Know too that though I did lay hands on
Samuel Phillips, I never left him dead.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.060
And know finally...

43:58.240 --> 44:01.869
that these two men did naught
but come along with I to fetch me home.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.417
Though I be part guilty,
these be wholly innocent.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.342
As God is my witness, I swear it.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.699
(Shouting from crowd)

44:17.800 --> 44:19.119
(Angry shouting)

44:22.760 --> 44:24.421
Have mercy.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.541
(Pleading for mercy)

45:09.560 --> 45:11.983
One moment! One moment!

45:20.120 --> 45:21.940
My Lords...

45:24.600 --> 45:27.023
...when we send a man to meet his Maker,

45:27.720 --> 45:31.781
we must be very certain...
not only of his guilt,

45:31.960 --> 45:35.657
but of our motives in doing so.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.707
Is our aim to see justice done...

45:40.520 --> 45:43.978
- ...or is it to terrify people into submission?
- This man has no authority here.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.139
- He has no right...
- Let him speak.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.508
My Lords, I admit

45:48.680 --> 45:52.377
these are difficult times
to be merciful.

45:52.560 --> 45:56.189
When authority is challenged,
our impulse is to reassert it

45:56.360 --> 45:58.339
in the sternest way possible.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.784
But consider,
here we face conditions

46:02.960 --> 46:05.224
harsher than we have ever known.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.779
Grain is shipped abroad...

46:08.760 --> 46:10.739
...while ordinary people starve.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.098
These men have no grievance
against authority...

46:20.000 --> 46:23.697
...but against the merchants
who grow fat on trade while people die.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.541
(People call out in agreement)

46:30.080 --> 46:33.584
To show mercy now
would not be a sign of weakness.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.259
A signal that justice...

46:38.560 --> 46:42.940
...real justice, had been served...
would be a reprieve.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.027
- Reprieve!
- Reprieve!

46:50.200 --> 46:53.340
OTHERS: Reprieve! Reprieve!

46:54.600 --> 46:56.784
CROWD: Reprieve! Reprieve! Reprieve!

47:03.160 --> 47:05.139
So Ross could not come.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.261
He had business in town.

47:12.760 --> 47:15.467
I think 'tis better if we do not meet at all now.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.339
Do I disquiet you so?

47:19.520 --> 47:21.499
I think we disquiet each other.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.699
Demelza, I must tell you...

47:30.360 --> 47:33.705
- Yes? _
- There were three further “ms to my poem.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.659
What were they?

47:40.120 --> 47:42.099
"And if this day be all

47:43.840 --> 47:45.819
Proud is my heart's recall

47:47.240 --> 47:49.663
Proud is my funeral pall."

47:52.640 --> 47:54.380
What do they mean?

47:57.000 --> 48:01.664
That if I cannot love you again...
it'll be the death of me.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.864
CROWD: Reprieve! Reprieve! Reprieve!

48:22.480 --> 48:24.345
(Whispers)

48:27.240 --> 48:29.219
(Crowd falls silent)

48:29.400 --> 48:33.177
The court in its mercy grants reprieve
to Samuel Came...

48:33.360 --> 48:34.543
- Yes.
- ..and Drake Came.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.426
(Cheering)

48:38.760 --> 48:42.218
- Jago Martin will hang.
CROWD: No!

48:43.320 --> 48:45.299
My Lord!

48:47.200 --> 48:49.020
- (Women scream)
- No!

48:50.320 --> 48:52.299
No!

48:54.840 --> 48:56.819
No!

48:57.120 --> 48:59.145
No...

49:01.560 --> 49:03.061
(Shouﬁng)

49:04.440 --> 49:05.543
(Whispers)

49:06.440 --> 49:08.419
MR MARTIN: N0!

49:15.200 --> 49:17.987
(Waﬁing)
-(Shouﬁng)

49:24.440 --> 49:26.863
(Crowd falls silent)

49:31.120 --> 49:32.781
(Mr Martin continues sobbing)

49:39.960 --> 49:42.099
(Sobbing)

49:45.360 --> 49:47.464
- (Rope creaking)
- (Muttered jeering)

50:03.160 --> 50:05.139
(Door opens and closes)

50:21.000 --> 50:22.979
Did you want something, Osborne?

50:23.720 --> 50:26.939
No, no. Nothing at all.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.519
(Door slams)

50:31.680 --> 50:33.227
(Footsteps recede)

50:41.280 --> 50:42.417
(Signs)

51:08.400 --> 51:12.302
Ah, I grow weary
of this provincial bacloNater.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.539
Quite right, my dear.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.903
A new era is beginning.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.058
And we will take full advantage of it.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.419
You once did lose a child.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.619
Julia.

51:55.160 --> 51:57.139
So 'ee do know.

51:58.560 --> 52:00.539
Yes.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.139
I know.

52:23.720 --> 52:25.699
I had your note.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.099
Life is cheap.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.785
But as Basset himself said,
if it deters others from like resistance...

52:31.960 --> 52:33.427
Which apparently it has.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.579
...perhaps it was not in vain.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.146
Tell that to Zaclq.

52:44.120 --> 52:47.419
And what of your own resistance
to public office?

52:47.600 --> 52:49.386
What of it?

52:49.560 --> 52:51.983
I'd say Basset taught you a valuable lesson.

52:52.160 --> 52:56.347
- To affect genuine change...
- I must sell my soul and become a politician.

52:56.520 --> 52:59.819
Well, the nomination
has gone elsewhere.

53:00.400 --> 53:03.062
Armitage will oppose George
in the next election.

53:03.240 --> 53:06.380
He will. If he's well enough.

53:11.160 --> 53:12.980
You said he is.

53:13.160 --> 53:15.139
I may not have been entirely truthful.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.339
(Waves crashing)

53:33.200 --> 53:35.304
O4ROU/VE'
You really think Hugh is fit to stand?

53:35.480 --> 53:38.460
His eyesight's improved but...

53:38.640 --> 53:41.461
there were other
less encouragIng SIgns.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.701
An EXCESS 0f nervous energy,

53:43.880 --> 53:46.747
something feverish in his demeanour.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.504
Were that all,
I'd say there was no cause for concern.

53:50.680 --> 53:55.617
But...if the fever is symptomatic
of some other condition,

53:55.800 --> 53:57.779
along with the headaches...

53:59.000 --> 54:00.262
It's strange, though.

54:00.440 --> 54:05.423
I thought him so much more robust than I
and now he ails and I grow stronger.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.784
Strong enough to consider
an addition to our household?

54:15.040 --> 54:16.507
Do you mean...?

54:20.160 --> 54:21.661
(Dog growls softly)

54:26.840 --> 54:28.819
(Barks)

54:33.200 --> 54:36.067
My dear, can your election plans
wait for another night?

54:36.240 --> 54:38.424
Perhaps you could attend to your wife.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.219
Or must she attend to you?

54:59.400 --> 55:01.265
Ross.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.863
- I thought maybe you'd stay in Truro.
- Demelza.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.701
I must tell you...

55:05.880 --> 55:07.745
there was a hanging.

55:07.920 --> 55:08.989
Dear God.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.025
Three sentenced, two reprieved.

55:11.200 --> 55:13.179
Who was it?

55:58.680 --> 56:00.227
How was Hugh?

56:03.320 --> 56:05.538
He seemed a little...fragile.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.021
But still in love with you?

56:11.040 --> 56:12.746
I think so.

56:14.600 --> 56:15.817
And you?

56:17.360 --> 56:20.261
I'm grieved for him -
that his health is so uncertain.

56:22.680 --> 56:25.467
They say pity is akin to love.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.786
I don't think it's pity he wants.

56:27.960 --> 56:30.178
They say it's the last thing a man wants.

56:31.400 --> 56:32.822
Or a woman.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.699
Did you pity me
when you left me for Elizabeth?

56:40.880 --> 56:43.940
- I never left you.
- It seemed to me like you did.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.388
That night.

56:47.680 --> 56:49.147
And the day you met her at the church.

56:49.320 --> 56:52.824
I never told you at the time because I
didn't trust myself to find the words.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.980
- To say you still loved her?
- No. The reverse.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.582
I loved her once, as well you know,

57:02.760 --> 57:06.105
and there's a part of me that will always
think of her with affection but...

57:07.280 --> 57:12.820
...I realised that day that she never was,
and never could be, what you are to me.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.467
Indispensable.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.067
Irreplaceable.

57:24.440 --> 57:26.419
You tell me this now because...?

57:26.600 --> 57:28.977
I think perhaps I've taken you for granted.

57:30.360 --> 57:34.262
Assumed you knew...
what to me was obvious.

57:34.440 --> 57:36.419
That you are the better part of me.

57:37.360 --> 57:39.817
I think perhaps I've been guilty of the same.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.219
Oh, Ross...

57:47.440 --> 57:50.341
...how can it be that two people
who love so much...

57:50.520 --> 57:52.829
Understand so little?

58:01.440 --> 58:03.419
Is it now too late?

58:11.880 --> 58:13.780
I hope not.
