>> John: HI THERE!

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
WELCOME TO THE SHOW,

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
STILL, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
THINK OF IT LIKE PRINCE PHILIP,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
IN THAT IT'S WHITE,

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING,

00:37.000 --> 00:37.000
AND I THOUGHT FOR SURE IT'D BE

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
GONE BY NOW.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
AND WE HAVE TO DIVE STRAIGHT IN

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
WITH TUESDAY'S HORRIFIC EVENTS

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
IN THE ATLANTA AREA,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
WHERE A GUNMAN

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
SIX OF THEM ASIAN WOMEN,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
AT THREE DIFFERENT SPAS.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
AND SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS HAS

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
POURED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
ALTHOUGH THERE'VE BEEN SOME

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
TERRIBLE REACTIONS, TOO --

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
LIKE THE ONE FROM THIS OFFICER

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
WHO BRIEFED THE PRESS.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
ABOUT THIS STATEMENT, WHICH MANY

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
FEEL APPEARS TO SYMPATHIZE WITH

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
THE SHOOTER AND NOT HIS ALLEGED

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
VICTIMS.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
>> I SPOKE WITH INVESTIGATORS.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
THEY INTERVIEWED HIM THIS

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
MORNING AND I -- THEY GOT THAT

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
IMPRESSION THAT, YES, HE -- HE

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVITY OF IT

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
AND HE WAS PRETTY MUCH FED UP,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
AT THE END OF HIS ROPE.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
AND -- AND YESTERDAY WAS

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
A REALLY BAD DAY FOR HIM.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
AND THIS IS WHAT HE DID.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
>> John: OKAY, ABSOLUTELY

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
FUCKING NOT.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
YOU GET THAT THIS IS A PRESS

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
CONFERENCE ABOUT A MASS MURDER,

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
RIGHT?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
YOU DON'T GET TO MINIMIZE WHAT

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
HAPPENED LIKE THAT.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
"REALLY BAD DAY?"

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
ALEXANDER HAD A TERRIBLE,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
AND WHAT HE DID WAS SHRUG IT

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
THE FUCK OFF AND GO TO BED WHILE

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
MANAGING TO MURDER ZERO PEOPLE.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
THAT COP EVEN WENT ON TO REPEAT

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
THE SHOOTER'S CLAIMS THAT HIS

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
ATTACKS WEREN'T RACIALLY

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
MOTIVATED; INSTEAD,

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
HIS "SEXUAL ADDICTION" WAS

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
TO BLAME FOR THE KILLINGS.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
WHICH ALREADY FEELS LIKE A

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
WEIRD DISTINCTION TO BE MAKING.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
"HEY!

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I MIGHT BE A MASS-MURDERER,

01:52.000 --> 01:52.000
BUT WATCH WHO YOU CALL A RACIST,

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
BUDDY!

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
WORDS HURT!"

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
AND WHILE IT IS STILL EARLY,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
DETAILS ARE STILL COMING OUT,

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
AND AUTHORITIES SEEM UNWILLING

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
TO CALL THIS A HATE CRIME.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I WILL SAY, A WHITE MAN

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
DRIVING ACROSS COUNTIES

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
TO TWO DIFFERENT TOWNS,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
GOING TO THREE ASIAN-OWNED

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
BUSINESSES, SHOOTING AND KILLING

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
SIX ASIAN WOMEN, IN A CITY

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 4% ASIAN

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
SURE AS SHIT SEEMS A LOT MORE

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
LIKE A HATE CRIME THAN

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
"A BAD FUCKING DAY."

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
AND THIS IS JUST THE LATEST DATA

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
POINT IN A DISTURBING PATTERN.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
ONE GROUP TRACKING HATE-RELATED

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
INCIDENTS AGAINST

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS -- WHICH INCLUDE

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
PHYSICAL ASSAULTS,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
VERBAL HARASSMENT, AND

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS LIKE

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
REFUSAL OF SERVICE -- FOUND

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
NEARLY 3800 REPORTED IN JUST

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
THE PAST YEAR.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
TREND THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
ABOUT JUST LAST WEEK.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
>> VICIOUS HATE CRIMES AGAINST

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS, WHO'VE BEEN

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
ATTACKED, HARASSED, BLAMED, AND

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
SCAPEGOATED.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
IT'S WRONG, IT'S UN-AMERICAN,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
AND IT MUST STOP.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
>> John: YEAH.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
IT MUST.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
AND I AM REALLY GLAD HE

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
CONDEMNED HATE CRIMES AGAINST

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS THERE, BUT TO

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
SAY THAT THEY ARE "UN-AMERICAN?"

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I'D LOVE TO VISIT THE NATION

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
THAT EXISTS IN JOE BIDEN'S HEAD,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE WHERE

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
RACISM "IS NOT WHO WE ARE" AND

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
RACIAL ATTACKS AGAINST ASIANS

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
ARE SOMEHOW "UN-AMERICAN,"

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
DESPITE THE FACT -- AND FAR BE

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
IT FROM ME TO EXPLAIN THIS TO

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
SOMEONE WHO SEEMS LIKE HE'S

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
LIVED THROUGH MOST OF AMERICAN

03:10.000 --> 03:10.000
HISTORY -- ANTI-ASIAN RACISM HAS

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
LONG BEEN A FACT OF AMERICAN

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
LIFE.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.000
FROM THE TREATMENT OF

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
CHINESE RAILROAD WORKERS

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
IN THE 1800s, THROUGH

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
THROUGH THE WATSONVILLE RIOTS

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
IN 1930, IN WHICH A WHITE MOB

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
RAMPAGED THROUGH A FILIPINO

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
COMMUNITY,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
THROUGH THE INTERNMENT OF

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
JAPANESE AMERICANS DURING

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
WORLD WAR II, THROUGH DEADLY

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
CASES OF RACIAL SCAPEGOATING

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
LIKE THE MURDER OF VINCENT CHIN,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
KILLED IN 1982 BY TWO

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
WHITE AUTOWORKERS IN DETROIT.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
WITNESSES SAID THE MEN MISTOOK

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
CHIN, A CHINESE-AMERICAN, FOR

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
BEING JAPANESE, BLAMED HIM FOR

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
TAKING THEIR JOBS, AND BEAT HIM

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
TO DEATH.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
AND BY THE WAY, EVEN THOUGH

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
THEY'D REPORTEDLY USED

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
RACIAL SLURS DURING THE ATTACK,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
THE MEN STILL TRIED TO CLAIM

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
THEY WERE NOT MOTIVATED BY RACE.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
SO NOT ONLY ARE HATE CRIMES

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
AGAINST ASIAN-AMERICANS VERY

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
MUCH "AMERICAN," SO IS DENYING

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
THAT THEY'RE RACIST.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
IT'S ALL SO AMERICAN, IN FACT,

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM COULD

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
PROBABLY BEGIN:

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
"OH, SAY CAN YOU SEE

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
THAT THIS WASN'T ABOUT RACE."

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
AND OUR LONG, UGLY HISTORY OF

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
ANTI-ASIAN RACISM -- AND THE

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
FACT IT OFTEN PEAKS DURING TIMES

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
OF CRISIS -- IS THE VERY REASON

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
WHY, JUST LAST YEAR, MANY WERE

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
LOUDLY WARNING THAT TRUMP

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
CALLING COVID NAMES LIKE

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
"THE CHINA VIRUS" WAS LIKELY TO

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
LEAD TO A RISE IN VIOLENCE

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
AGAINST PEOPLE OF ASIAN DESCENT,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
AN ARGUMENT THAT AT THE TIME,

04:28.000 --> 04:28.000
NOT EVERYONE SEEMED TO FIND

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
CONVINCING.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
>> I THINK IF THE LEFT WANTS TO

04:31.000 --> 04:31.000
FOCUS ON PC LABELING THIS VIRUS,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
IT IS A GREAT WAY TO GET TRUMP

04:33.000 --> 04:33.000
REELECTED.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
PEOPLE CALLING IT WHATEVER THEY

04:35.000 --> 04:35.000
WANT.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
IT'S A DEADLY VIRUS THAT DID

04:37.000 --> 04:37.000
ORIGINATE IN WUHAN.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
>> John: OH, GOOD!

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
MEGHAN McCAIN DOESN'T

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
LISTEN NOT TO THE SCORES OF

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS TELLING EVERYONE

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
THAT THE TERM IS DANGEROUS AND

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
OFFENSIVE!

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
INSTEAD, GATHER ROUND,

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
AND TAKE THE WORD OF A WEALTHY

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
WHITE WOMAN WHO'S DRESSED LIKE

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
SHE'S ABOUT TO LAY OFF 47 PEOPLE

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
OVER ZOOM.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
NOW, I WILL SAY, McCAIN POSTED

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
THIS WEEK, "STOP ASIAN HATE"

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WITH THREE BROKEN HEART EMOJIS.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
WHICH IS A FINE SENTIMENT TO

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
THROW UP ON TWITTER AFTER THE

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
FACT, BUT THERE HAS TO BE AN

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
UNDERSTANDING THAT SAYING,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
"I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
CALLING IT THE CHINA VIRUS"

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
IS VERY MUCH GIVING SPACE FOR

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
THAT HATE TO GROW.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
AND THE MINIMIZATION OF RACIST

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
RHETORIC PLAYS INTO THE HARMFUL

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
STEREOTYPE OF ASIAN-AMERICANS AS

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
A "MODEL MINORITY," PITTING THEM

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
AGAINST OTHER MINORITY GROUPS

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
AND PRESSURING THEM TO SWALLOW

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH RACISM

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
WITHOUT MAKING A STINK, BECAUSE

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
THAT'S HOW YOU EARN

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
WHITE ACCEPTANCE.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
ITS TOLL.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
JUST LISTEN TO BASKETBALL PLAYER

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
JEREMY LIN, WHO RECENTLY

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
REVEALED THAT HE'D BEEN CALLED

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
"CORONAVIRUS" ON THE COURT, AND

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
SPOKE ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THIS

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
WEEK.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
>> ASIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN --

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
HAVE BEEN PROJECTED AS BEING

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
OTHERS OR OUTSIDERS AND YOU

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
CAN -- YOU CAN HEAR AND SEE

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
THESE MICROAGGRESSIONS, IN LIKE,

05:49.000 --> 05:49.000
"OH, NO, WHERE ARE YOU REALLY

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
FROM?"

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
OR, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT THE

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
WAY WE LOOK OR OUR COMPLEXION

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
AND, AGAIN, CALLING IT THE CHINA

05:58.000 --> 05:58.000
VIRUS, KUNG FLU VIRUS, THAT IS

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
ADDING TO IT, FUELING THE FIRE,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
LOT OF THOSE MICROAGGRESSIONS

06:03.000 --> 06:03.000
TURN INTO ACTUAL ACTS OF

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
VIOLENCE.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
>> John: RIGHT.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
COMMENTS LIKE, "WHERE ARE YOU

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
REALLY FROM?" ARE CONSTANT

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
REMINDERS OF HOW

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS ARE REGARDED AS

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
OUTSIDERS, AS PEOPLE WHO DON'T

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
BELONG.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
AND THE FACT IS, "WHERE ARE YOU

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
REALLY FROM?" IS JUST NOT AN

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
APPROPRIATE QUESTION TO ASK

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
ANYONE, UNLESS THEY'VE JUST

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
OPENED UP THEIR TORSO TO REVEAL

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
A TINY ALIEN SQUID OPERATING

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
A ROBOT BODY.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
AND EVEN THEN, HONESTLY, IT'S

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
STILL A BIT IFFY.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
"WELL MY PARENTS ARE FROM

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
RIGEL VII, BUT I WAS BORN IN

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
CINCINNATI, YOU DICK!"

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
THE COMFORT PEOPLE HAVE WITH

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
DIMINISHING AND OTHERING ASIANS

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
IS PERVASIVE.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
EVEN THAT OFFICER YOU SAW

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
EARLIER WAS LAST YEAR PROMOTING

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
T-SHIRTS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
CALLING COVID-19 AN

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
"IMPORTED VIRUS FROM CHY-NA."

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
AND THE FACT THE KILLER CHOSE

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
THESE PARTICULAR WOMEN,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
WORKING LOW-WAGE JOBS, AS

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
TARGETS FOR HIS "SEX ADDICTION"

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
SPEAKS TO HOW ASIAN-AMERICAN

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
WOMEN, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE TO

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
DEAL WITH HYPERSEXUALIZATION,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
AND HOW ASIAN WORKERS TO THE

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
EXTENT THAT THEY ARE SEEN AT ALL

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
ARE SEEN MORE FOR THE LABOR THAT

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
THEY PROVIDE RATHER THAN THE

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
FULL THREE-DIMENSIONAL HUMANS

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
THAT THEY ARE.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.000
SO THERE'S PRETTY CLEARLY A LOT

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
THAT NEEDS TO BE CONFRONTED

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
HERE, AS MANY HAVE BEEN POINTING

07:16.000 --> 07:16.000
OUT.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
LONG INVISIBLE IN THIS SOCIETY.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
IS NOT A RACIST INCIDENT.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
IT IS A RACIST INCIDENT BECAUSE

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
OF THE WAY ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMEN

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
EXPERIENCE RACISM IN OUR

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
COUNTRY.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
>> John: EXACTLY.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
THIS ISN'T JUST A CONVERSATION

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
ABOUT THIS WEEK.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
THE CENTURIES LEADING UP TO IT.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
NOW, SOME HAVE RESPONDED BY

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
CALLING FOR INCREASED POLICE

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
PRESENCE, ALTHOUGH OTHERS ARE

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
UNDERSTANDABLY WARY OF "MORE

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
MORE GUYS LIKE "DEPUTY OOPS ALL

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
FOREHEAD" HERE AREN'T LIKELY TO

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
MAKE ASIAN-AMERICANS, OR,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
INDEED, OTHER COMMUNITIES OF

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
SAFER.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
FROM CONNECTING VICTIMS OF

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
TRAUMA TO SUPPORT AFTER THE

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
FACT, TO IMPROVING COLLECTION

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
ON ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE AND

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
DISCRIMINATION, SO WE HAVE

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
A MUCH MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
AND IF YOU DO WANT TO HELP,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
THERE ARE SOME GREAT

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THESE ONES

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
THAT COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
LOOK, ASIAN-AMERICAN AND

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
ASIAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
HAVE BEEN FEELING EXTREMELY

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
VULNERABLE FOR A LONG TIME,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
AND ESPECIALLY SO RIGHT NOW.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
AND FOR A GROUP WHOSE SUFFERING

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
HAS HISTORICALLY FELT INVISIBLE

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
TO THE MEDIA AND THE COUNTRY AT

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
LARGE, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PAIN RIGHT NOW.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
BUT MORE THAN THAT, DISMANTLING

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
ANTI-ASIAN PREJUDICE SHOULD BE

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000

YOU CAN'T BE HERE!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
WAIT -- YOU GOT THE VACCINE?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU ELIGIBLE

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
FOR THE VACCINE?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
>> HYPERTENSION, JOHN.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
>> John: OH, BULLSHIT!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:09.000 --> 13:09.000
I DON'T CARE!

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!

13:13.000 --> 13:13.000
GET OUT OF HERE!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
YOU'RE SO MUCH WORSE IN PERSON,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
TOTES!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
YOU LOOK LIKE A FURRY

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
WHO CAN'T COMMIT.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
GET OUT OF HERE!

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
THE FACT IS, A HUGE AMOUNT OF

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
THE PLASTIC SURROUNDING US

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
ISN'T RECYCLED BECAUSE IT'S

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
NOT REALLY RECYCLABLE.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
AND THAT MEANS IT ENDS UP IN

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
LANDFILLS, OR BURNT, OR IN THE

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
OCEAN, WHERE IT BREAKS DOWN INTO

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
"MICRO-PLASTICS," GET EATEN BY

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
FISH, AND CAN END UP INSIDE US.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
>> PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN HAS A

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
TENDENCY TO BREAK DOWN INTO EVER

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
SMALLER PIECES.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
AND THESE TINY PIECES THEN GET

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
TAKEN UP EVEN LOWER DOWN

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
IN THE FOOD CHAIN.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
SO WE KNOW THAT IT ENDS UP ON

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
OUR DINNER PLATES.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
THERE IS PLASTIC IN YOUR FOOD,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
PLASTIC IN YOUR SEA SALT,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
AND PLASTIC COMING OUT OF YOUR

13:53.000 --> 13:53.000
TAP.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
A RECENT STUDY EVEN ESTIMATED

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
THAT AN AVERAGE PERSON GLOBALLY

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
COULD BE INGESTING ABOUT A

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
CREDIT CARD'S WORTH OF PLASTIC

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
INTO THEIR SYSTEM EVERY WEEK.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
WHICH KIND OF EXPLAINS

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
CAPITAL ONE'S NEW SLOGAN,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
"WHAT'S IN YOUR STOMACH?"

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
GOOD QUESTION, MR. JACKSON.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
BECAUSE APPARENTLY, IT'S

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
1.5% CASH BACK, A FEW THOUSAND

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
FREE AIRLINE MILES, AND A

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
FUCKING SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
SO HOW IS IT THAT TONS OF

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
PLASTIC THAT WE ASSUME IS

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
GETTING RECYCLED CAN INSTEAD

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
SOMETIMES END UP INSIDE OF US?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
WELL, THAT IS WHAT THIS STORY IS

14:24.000 --> 14:24.000
ABOUT.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
IT'S ABOUT WHY SO LITTLE PLASTIC

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
GETS RECYCLED, THE HARM THAT

14:28.000 --> 14:28.000
CAN DO, AND HOW THE PLASTICS

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
INDUSTRY HAS MANAGED TO CONVINCE

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
US ALL THAT IT'S OUR FAULT.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
AND LET'S START WITH SOME

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
HISTORY.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
AS PLASTIC PRODUCTION

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
BEGAN TO GROW IN THE 1950s,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
SO DID PLASTIC WASTE, AND

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
THEREFORE, PUBLIC BACKLASH.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
BY THE '60s AND '70s,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
ORGANIZATIONS BEGAN DRAWING

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
ATTENTION TO ALL THE PACKAGING

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
WASTE LITTERING THE LANDSCAPE,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
THROUGH ADS LIKE THIS ONE.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
>> SOME PEOPLE HAVE A DEEP,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
ABIDING RESPECT FOR THE NATURAL

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
BEAUTY THAT WAS ONCE THIS

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
COUNTRY.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
PEOPLE START POLLUTION.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
PEOPLE CAN STOP IT.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
>> John: NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
THAT AD BEFORE.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
IT REALLY TOUCHED PEOPLE'S

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
HEARTSTRINGS, BECAUSE APPARENTLY

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
THE WORST THING WHITE PEOPLE

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
EVER DID TO AMERICA'S INDIGENOUS

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
POPULATIONS WAS LITTER ON THE

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
FREEWAY.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
BUT THERE ARE A FEW MISLEADING

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
THINGS ABOUT IT.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
FIRST, THAT MAN WASN'T ACTUALLY

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
NATIVE AMERICAN -- HE WAS AN

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
ITALIAN-AMERICAN ACTOR WHO

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
PLAYED THEM FOR A LIVING.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
AND WHILE IT'S BY NO MEANS

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE OF

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
ITALIAN DESCENT INSERTED

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
THEMSELVES INTO A

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
NATIVE AMERICAN NARRATIVE

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
WITHOUT ASKING, I GUESS AT LEAST

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
THIS TIME NO ONE NAMED A HOLIDAY

15:28.000 --> 15:28.000
AFTER HIM.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
BUT MORE TO THE POINT,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
THE ORGANIZATION THAT PRODUCED

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
THAT AD, KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
WAS FUNDED IN PART BY A PLASTICS

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
INDUSTRY TRADE GROUP, AND

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
COMPOSED OF LEADING BEVERAGE AND

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
PACKAGING CORPORATIONS.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
WHICH MIGHT SEEM ODD, UNTIL YOU

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
REALIZE THAT THE UNDERLYING

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
MESSAGE THERE IS,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
"IT'S UP TO YOU, THE CONSUMER,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
TO STOP POLLUTION."

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
AND THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
THROUGHLINE IN THE RECYCLING

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
MOVEMENT -- A MOVEMENT OFTEN

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
BANKROLLED BY COMPANIES WHO

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
WANTED TO DRILL HOME THE MESSAGE

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
TO DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
IMPACT OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
AND NOWHERE IS THIS CO-OPTING OF

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
ENVIRONMENTALISM CLEARER THAN

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
WITH THAT RECYCLING SYMBOL THAT

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
YOU FIND ON PLASTIC PRODUCTS YOU

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
BUY -- THE FAMOUS "CHASING

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
ARROWS."

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
THEY ARE ON EVERYTHING,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
AND THE NUMBERS INSIDE THEM ARE

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
PRETTY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THEY

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
REPRESENT WHAT TYPE OF PLASTIC

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
IT IS.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
>> NUMBER 1 STANDS FOR P.E.T.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
THINK WATER AND SODA BOTTLES.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
NUMBER 2 IS HDPE, OFTEN USED AS

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
PACKAGING FOR DETERGENT AND

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
SHAMPOO.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
THEN, THERE'S 3, 4, 5, 6, AND

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
WILD CARD NUMBER 7, WHICH STANDS

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
FOR OTHER -- MEANING EVERYTHING

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
ELSE.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
>> John: RIGHT, NUMBER 7 IS

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
BASICALLY THE CATCH-ALL FOR

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
"EVERYTHING ELSE," IN THE SAME

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
WAY THAT THAT ONE DRAWER

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
IN YOUR KITCHEN IS A CATCH-ALL

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
FOR EVERYTHING.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
YEAH, THERE'S KETCHUP PACKETS,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
BUT ALSO, RUBBER BANDS,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
THE INSTRUCTIONS TO AN IMMERSION

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
BLENDER YOU LOST A YEAR AGO,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
AND A POST-IT NOTE WITH JUST

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
A PHONE NUMBER ON IT AND

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
NO INDICATION WHO IT BELONGS TO.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
CALL THAT NUMBER!

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I DARE YOU!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
BUT CRUCIALLY, VERY FEW OF THOSE

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
SEVEN TYPES OF PLASTIC ARE

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
COMMONLY RECYCLABLE.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
CERTAIN TYPES OF NUMBER 1 AND 2

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
PLASTICS -- THINGS LIKE SODA AND

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
LAUNDRY DETERGENT BOTTLES -- DO

17:03.000 --> 17:03.000
GET RECYCLED.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
ALTHOUGH, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
LIVE, CERTAIN OTHER TYPES --

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
LIKE THOSE LETTUCE TUBS YOU SAW

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
EARLIER -- MAY NOT.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
AND WHEN IT COMES TO PLASTICS

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
NUMBERS 3 THROUGH 7 -- WHICH CAN

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
BE THINGS LIKE PLASTIC BAGS,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
CUPS, OR POUCHES -- WE HAVE THE

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
CAPACITY TO RECYCLE LESS THAN

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
5% OF IT.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
SO OUT OF THE SEVEN NUMBERS,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
ONLY TWO ARE REALLY MUCH GOOD.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.000
AND THAT IS A PRETTY BAD RATIO

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
FOR A GROUP OF SEVEN.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
IDEALLY, YOU'D WANT A BALANCE

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
A LITTLE MORE LIKE BTS.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
THERE'S NOT A WEAK LINK IN THAT

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
UNBREAKABLE CHAIN OF

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
HEARTTHROBS.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE ONSTAGE,

17:33.000 --> 17:33.000
YOU'D UNDERSTAND IF SOMETIMES

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
JIMIN ONLY GAVE 50%,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
BUT HE DOESN'T, HE BEATS UP

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
THE DANCE FLOOR EVERY NIGHT

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
LIKE HE JUST CAUGHT IT

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
ROBBING HIS HOUSE.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
REASONS WHY CERTAIN PLASTICS

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
DON'T GET RECYCLED.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
SOME ARE COMPLEX MIXES OF

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
DIFFERENT RESINS, MAKING

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
RECYCLING THEM DIFFICULT.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
OTHER TIMES, THERE ARE PRACTICAL

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
OBSTACLES -- THAT THE PLASTIC IS

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
CONTAMINATED, OR DIFFICULT TO

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
SORT.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
AND THEN THERE ARE ECONOMIC

17:57.000 --> 17:57.000
REASONS -- SOMETIMES, THERE'S

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
NO MARKET FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
PLASTIC.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
AND RIGHT NOW, IT'S CHEAPER FOR

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
COMPANIES TO MAKE VIRGIN PLASTIC

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
THAN FOR THEM TO RECYCLE IT.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
BUT THE THING IS, DESPITE

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
KNOWING THAT MOST PLASTICS

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
CAN'T BE RECYCLED, THE INDUSTRY

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
LOBBIED STATE LEGISLATURES TO

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
PASS LAWS REQUIRING THAT CHASING

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
ARROWS SYMBOL TO BE PLACED ON

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
ALL OF THEIR CONTAINERS,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY COULD

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED OR NOT.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
MANUFACTURERS AND COMPANIES

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
LIKE COCA-COLA ALSO LOBBIED

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INVEST

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
IN CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAMS,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
EVEN THOUGH, BEHIND DOORS,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
ONE INDUSTRY INSIDER

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
ACKNOWLEDGED AS FAR BACK AS 1974

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
THAT, "THERE IS SERIOUS DOUBT

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
THAT RECYCLING PLASTIC CAN EVER

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
BE MADE VIABLE ON AN ECONOMIC

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
BASIS."

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
AND HONESTLY, IT WASN'T ALL THAT

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONVINCE

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
US THAT ALL THEIR WASTE IS

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
RECYCLABLE, BECAUSE WE SO BADLY

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
LIES GO DOWN EASIER WHEN YOU

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
WANT THEM TO BE TRUE.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
IN FACT, OUR DESIRE FOR THINGS

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
TO BE RECYCLED IS SO STRONG THAT

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
EVEN HAVE A SPECIAL TERM FOR IT.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
>> A LOT OF THINGS REALLY AREN'T

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
RECYCLABLE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
WE WANT THEM TO BE.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
PEOPLE JUST WANT TO THROW,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IN AND,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
YOU KNOW, THEY WISH IT WAS

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
RECYCLING.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
SO WE CALL IT "WISHCYCLING."

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
HERE'S SOME "WISHCYCLING"

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
FOR YOU.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
HERE'S AN UMBRELLA.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I WISH IT WAS RECYCLABLE.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
IT'S NOT.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
>> John: NOW, FIRST OFF,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
HE'S RIGHT THAT UMBRELLAS ARE

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
NOT RECYCLABLE, WHICH IS A PITY,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
AS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN GOES

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
THROUGH ROUGHLY 4,000 OF THEM

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
A YEAR.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I'VE ALREADY SOMEHOW LOST 12

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
SO FAR THIS YEAR, AND IT DOESN'T

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
EVEN RAIN IN THIS VOID.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
AND SECONDLY, THE TERM

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
"WISHCYCLING" IS JUST TOO GOOD

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
TO BE WASTED ON GARBAGE.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
"WISHCYCLING" SOUNDS LIKE

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
A SPIN CLASS TAUGHT BY A

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
UNICORN, OR THE SEWAGE TREATMENT

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
SYSTEM AT HOGWARTS.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
"AND THIS, CHILDREN, IS WHERE

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
WE WISHCYCLE ALL YOUR COLLECTED

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
URINE INTO THIS DELICIOUS

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
BUTTERBEER!

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
OH, IT'S FINE, CALM DOWN, IT'S

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
MAGIC, STOP CRYING, IT'S FINE."

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
BUT WISHCYCLING CAN END UP DOING

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
REAL HARM.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
BECAUSE AT BEST, NON-RECYCLABLE

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
ITEMS CAN BE A HASSLE TO REMOVE.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
PLANTS OFTEN HAVE TO STOP

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
MACHINES TO CUT OUT ALL OF

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
THE PLASTIC BAGS THAT PEOPLE

20:01.000 --> 20:01.000
DESPERATELY WANT TO THINK THEY

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
CAN HANDLE.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
AND AT WORST, THEY CAN END UP

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
CONTAMINATING LOADS OF PLASTICS

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
RECYCLED.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
SO THE FALSE IMPRESSION WE'VE

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
ALL BEEN GIVEN THAT ALL

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
THE PLASTICS WE'RE PUTTING INTO

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
THE RECYCLING ARE BEING

20:16.000 --> 20:16.000
RECYCLED IS VERY MUCH

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
NOT THE CASE.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
AND FOR A FEW BLISSFUL DECADES,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
AMERICA AND MOST OF THE WORLD

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
DIDN'T REALLY WORRY ABOUT THIS,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY SHIPPED MUCH

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
OF THE LOWER-QUALITY PLASTIC

20:26.000 --> 20:26.000
WASTE WE COULDN'T USE, IN BULK,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
TO CHINA.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
AT ONE POINT, ROUGHLY 70% OF

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
THE WORLD'S PLASTIC WASTE WENT

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
THERE.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
BUT THAT STOPPED IN 2018, WHEN

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
CHINA FLAT-OUT BANNED THE IMPORT

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
OF MOST PLASTICS.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
AND SINCE THEN, MUCH OF OUR

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
WASTE HAS BEEN LEFT TO EITHER

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
PILE UP IN DOMESTIC RECYCLING

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
PLANTS WITH NO ONE TO BUY IT OR

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
SHIPPED OUT TO OTHER COUNTRIES

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
IN ASIA, WHERE IT CAN GET

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
DROPPED INTO LANDFILLS, LIKE

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
THIS ONE IN MALAYSIA.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
>> LOOK AT HOW BIG THIS IS.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
JUST TAKE A LOOK.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
LOOK HOW FAR IT GOES.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
THIS IS JUST ONE DUMP.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
ONE DUMP.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
A VAST FIELD OF PLASTIC.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
TWO STORIES HIGH.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
>> SEE IF WE CAN LOOK ON THE

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
BACK HERE, "MARYSVILLE, OHIO."

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
THIS IS FROM ITALY,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
LOOK, WALMART BAG.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
>> John: YEAH, A LOT OF OUR

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
PLASTIC JUST ENDS UP SITTING

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
IN GIANT LANDFILLS ON THE OTHER

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
SIDE OF THE WORLD.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
SO I GUESS KATY PERRY'S

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
QUESTION, "DO YOU EVER FEEL

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
LIKE A PLASTIC BAG DRIFTING

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
THROUGH THE WIND, WANTING TO

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
START AGAIN?"

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
SHOULD REALLY BE, "DO YOU EVER

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
FEEL LIKE A PLASTIC WALMART BAG

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
DROWNING IN TWO STORIES OF

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
SOCIETY'S UNMITIGATED FILTH?"

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
AND SINCE YOU'RE ASKING -- YEAH,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
KATY, I DO.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
ALL THE TIME.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
AND THE PROBLEM IS, THOSE

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
COUNTRIES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
THE CAPABILITIES TO DEAL WITH

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
THEIR OWN PLASTIC WASTE, LET

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
ALONE MILLIONS OF TONS OF OURS.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
WHICH CAN HAVE SERIOUS

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH AND

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
SAFETY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
IN MALAYSIA, SOME OPERATIONS ARE

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
ILLEGALLY INCINERATING LOTS OF

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
PLASTIC WASTE.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
AND JUST LISTEN TO THIS

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
COMMUNITY ACTIVIST DESCRIBING

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE NEARBY.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
>> THE AIR POLLUTION BECOMES

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
VERY SERIOUS IN MY VILLAGE.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
THE BURNING CAUSED A LOT OF

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
RESPIRATORY DISEASE PROBLEMS

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
TO OUR PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY OUR

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
CHILDREN AND OUR ELDERLY, WHO

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
HAS THIS PROBLEM OF REPEATING

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
ASTHMA, REPEATING COUGHING

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
ALSO.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
>> John: THAT'S TERRIBLE.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
AND I HAVE TO SAY, THERE'S JUST

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
NO WAY THAT THE PEOPLE

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
RESPONSIBLE FOR BURNING THAT

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
WASTE DON'T KNOW THE FUMES ARE

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
TOXIC.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
WHEN YOU SMELL BURNING PLASTIC,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
YOU DON'T THINK, "OOH, THAT

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
SMELLS GREAT.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
IS SOMEONE BAKING COOKIES?"

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
YOU THINK, "MY NOSE SEEMS TO BE

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
DYING AND IT'S TAKING MY BRAIN

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
DOWN WITH IT."

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, MORE THAN

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
180 COUNTRIES AGREED LAST YEAR

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
TO PLACE STRICT LIMITS ON

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
EXPORTS OF PLASTIC WASTE FROM

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
RICHER COUNTRIES TO POORER ONES.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
FEW COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
DIDN'T RATIFY THAT GLOBAL BAND.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
AND THE THING IS,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
WHEN PLASTIC ISN'T

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
BURNED, IT CAN END UP IN

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
LANDFILLS OR IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
ACROSS THE WORLD, MORE THAN

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
EIGHT MILLION TONS END UP

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
IN OUR OCEANS EVERY YEAR.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
THERE'S FAMOUSLY EVEN A SWIRLING

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
GARBAGE PATCH OF MICROPLASTIC

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
WASTE IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
SPREAD OUT OVER AN AREA THAT IS

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
"BIGGER THAN FRANCE, GERMANY,

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
AND SPAIN COMBINED."

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
AND BY 2050, THE OCEAN IS

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
EXPECTED TO CONTAIN, BY WEIGHT,

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
MORE PLASTICS THAN FISH.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.000
THAT IS ALL FISH.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
THAT INCLUDES THE RED SNAPPER,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
SALMON, AND, OF COURSE

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
THE BLOB FISH, THE ONLY FISH

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
WITH A FACE THAT SCREAMS

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
"I WOULD BE VOICED BY

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
RICHARD KIND IN A PIXAR MOVIE

23:25.000 --> 23:25.000
AND HE WOULD ABSOLUTELY

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
NAIL IT."

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BLOB FISH?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY, JOHN, 100%!

23:28.000 --> 23:28.000
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I'M A BLOB FISH!

23:30.000 --> 23:30.000
I'M SLURP THE BLOB FISH!

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
>> John: OF COURSE YOU'RE CALLED

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
SLURP!

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
THAT IS SOME SPOT ON CASTING

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
RIGHT THERE.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
>> WELL, I'D ONLY BE A

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
SUPPORTING CHARACTER, BUT, LOOK,

23:37.000 --> 23:37.000
WITH THIS FACE?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL I'M GONNA

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
STEAL THE SHOW.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
>> John: I KNOW YOU WILL, SLURP!

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
>> I WOULD PROVIDE COMIC RELIEF

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
THROUGHOUT A VERY FUN, YET

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
INTERMITTENTLY TOUCHING FILM.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
AND WORD HAS IT THERE'S GONNA

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
BE AT LEAST TWO SEQUELS.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
AND JOHN?

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
ENTRE NOUS?

23:54.000 --> 23:54.000
>> John: YES?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
>> I DIE AT THE END OF

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
THE THIRD ONE!

23:57.000 --> 23:57.000
BUT DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT PROFIT

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
PARTICIPATION!

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
>> John: GOOD FOR YOU, SLURP!

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
GET THAT MONEY.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, THE PLASTICS

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
INDUSTRY'S RESPONSE TO ALL THE

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
DAMAGE YOU'VE SEEN HAS BEEN

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
TO MAKE A BIG SHOW OF TINY

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
IMPROVEMENTS, AND THEN REVERT

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
TO WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
WHICH IS HEAVILY PUSH THE IDEA

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
THAT IF WE AS CONSUMERS SIMPLY

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
TRIED HARD ENOUGH, WE COULD MAKE

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
OUR PLASTIC PROBLEM GO AWAY.

24:21.000 --> 24:21.000
KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL --

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
THE PEOPLE BEHIND THAT FAKE

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
NATIVE AMERICAN AD -- IS STILL

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
AROUND, MAKING DUMB COMMERCIALS

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE A BOTTLE

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
GOES ON A LONG, INSPIRING

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
JOURNEY TO A RECYCLING BIN AND

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
ENDS UP FULFILLING ITS DREAM OF

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
BECOMING A BENCH.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
AND IF BOTTLES WERE SENTIENT,

24:33.000 --> 24:33.000
I'D GENUINELY BE SURPRISED IF

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
THEIR BIGGEST DREAM WAS

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
"I WISH OLD PEOPLE WOULD PLAY

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
CHESS WHILE SITTING ON MY FACE."

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
BUT I WILL SAY, AT LEAST

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
THEY'RE BEING HONEST THERE THAT

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
THE BOTTLE BECAME A BENCH AND

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
THEN NOTHING ELSE.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, ONLY ABOUT

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
2% OF ALL RECYCLED PLASTIC WINDS

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
UP IN A SO-CALLED CLOSED-LOOP

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
SYSTEM, WHERE IT BECOMES THE

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
THING IT ORIGINALLY WAS,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
IN OTHER WORDS, A BOTTLE GETTING

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
RECYCLED AND BECOMING A BOTTLE

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
AGAIN.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
INSTEAD, MOST RECYCLED PLASTIC

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
GETS "DOWNCYCLED" TO

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
BECOME A CARPET,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
OR A FLEECE SWEATSHIRT, OR

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
INDEED, A BENCH, AND IT THEN

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
CAN'T BE RECYCLED AGAIN.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
AND YET DESPITE THIS FACT,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
COMPANIES LIKE NESTLE WATER HAVE

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
ADS INDICATING THAT IF WE JUST

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
DID OUR PART, PLASTICS COULD BE

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
PUT INTO CONTINUOUS REUSE, LIKE

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
THIS AD FROM 2012.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
>> NATURE HAS A BIOLOGICAL

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
METABOLISM WHERE ONE THING'S

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
WASTE BECOMES ANOTHER THING'S

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
FOOD.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
SO IF I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
A PLASTIC BOTTLE, I DON'T SEE

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
WASTE, I SEE A NUTRIENT.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
>> THIS IS RAW MATERIAL?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
>> SO IF THIS IS RAW MATERIAL,

25:39.000 --> 25:39.000
PEOPLE NEED TO START THINKING

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
>> IT COULD COME BACK AS A

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
BOTTLE, OF COURSE.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
>> WE ONLY HAVE TO MAKE THIS

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
VIRGIN MATERIAL ONE TIME.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
AND THE REST OF IT'S UP TO YOU.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
WE GET THE BOTTLE BACK, WE'LL

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
MAKE THIS BOTTLE OUT OF RECYCLED

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
CONTENT AGAIN.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
>> John: WELL, THAT SOUNDS

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
AMAZING!

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT THAT

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
EXECUTIVE BOARD KEN DOLL IS

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
SUGGESTING THERE IS COMPLETE

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
BULLSHIT.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
BECAUSE NESTLE WATER DOESN'T,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
IN FACT, HAVE TO MAKE VIRGIN

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
PLASTIC JUST "ONE TIME" IF YOU

26:09.000 --> 26:09.000
SIMPLY GIVE YOUR BOTTLE BACK.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
AND THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
EVEN EIGHT YEARS AFTER THAT AD

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
AIRED, ONLY 20% OF THE PLASTIC

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
THEY USE WAS RECYCLED, MEANING

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
80% WAS FROM VIRGIN MATERIAL.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
SO THAT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
OVERSTATEMENT IN AN AD SINCE

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
THIS ONE FOR GAMEBOY IN THE '90s

26:25.000 --> 26:25.000
THAT CLAIMED IT WAS

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
"MORE FUN THAN A FERRET DOWN

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
YOUR TROUSERS."

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
THAT AD IS REAL.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
AND I'M SORRY, MARIO, BUT NO,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
YOU'RE NOT MORE FUN.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
NOT IF THE FERRET KNOWS WHAT

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
IT'S DOING.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
AND THE CRAZY THING IS,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
THAT COMPANY ACTUALLY HAS

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
A BETTER TRACK RECORD THAN MANY

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
OTHER BRANDS WHEN IT COMES TO

26:42.000 --> 26:42.000
THIS.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
THAT IS HOW BAD THINGS ARE.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
TAKE COCA-COLA.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
BRAND AUDITS OF OF PLASTIC WASTE

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
COLLECTED AT CLEANUPS HAVE

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
CONSISTENTLY FOUND COKE PRODUCTS

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
AS THE NUMBER ONE TOP GLOBAL

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
POLLUTER.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
WHICH IS DAMNING.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
AND PROBABLY WHY COKE HAS BEEN

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
SO ANXIOUS TO MAKE SPLASHY

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
PROMISES WE ALL SO BADLY

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
WANT TO HEAR,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
LIKE PLEDGING TO USE AT LEAST

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
50% RECYCLED MATERIAL IN THEIR

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
PACKAGING BY 2030.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
WHICH DOES SOUNDS REALLY GOOD.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
THE PROBLEM IS, COKE HAS BEEN

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
MAKING AND BREAKING PROMISES

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
LIKE THAT FOR DECADES.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
REPEATEDLY, LOUDLY LAUNCHED BIG

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
RECYCLED-PLASTIC INITIATIVES

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
THAT THEY THEN QUIETLY

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
ABANDONED WITH NO ONE REALLY

27:25.000 --> 27:25.000
NOTICING.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
IN 2009, THEY ANNOUNCED PLANS

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
TO SOURCE 25% OF THEIR PLASTIC

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
FROM RECYCLED MATERIAL BY 2015.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
EXCEPT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
IT'S SIX YEARS PAST THAT

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
DEADLINE, AND THEIR CURRENT

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
PROPORTION IS JUST 10%.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
BY 2030, THE MAIN THING COKE IS

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
RECYCLING IS THE SAME BULLSHIT

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
PROMISES IT'S BEEN MAKING FOR

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
YEARS.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
AND LOOK, ON A PERSONAL LEVEL,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
I KNOW THIS CAN FEEL

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
DEMORALIZING,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
BECAUSE IT CAN SEEM THAT

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
RECYCLING IS POINTLESS.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

27:53.000 --> 27:53.000
IT'S NOT.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY KEEP

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
RECYCLING PAPER, CARDBOARD, AND

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
ALUMINUM.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
AND EVEN RECYCLING PLASTIC --

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
WHILE IT MIGHT BE 90% MORE

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
POINTLESS THAN YOU ASSUMED --

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
CAN STILL HAVE MODEST

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
ALTHOUGH, WE SHOULD DO IT MORE

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
MINDFULLY -- YOU SHOULD CHECK

28:09.000 --> 28:09.000
WITH YOUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITY TO

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
SEE WHAT TYPES OF PLASTIC THEY

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
ACCEPT, AND THEN ONLY RECYCLE

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
THOSE.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
OTHERWISE, REMEMBER, YOU COULD

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
END UP CONTAMINATING USABLE

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
MATERIALS.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
AND AS A GOOD RULE, DEFINITELY

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
DON'T "WISHCYCLE" THINGS LIKE

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
UMBRELLAS, BECAUSE THERE'S A

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
NONZERO CHANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING

28:24.000 --> 28:24.000
TO END UP ANGERING

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
TOTES McGOATS.

28:26.000 --> 28:26.000
OH, SHIT. NO.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
NO.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
NO.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
LEAVE THIS PLACE.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
NO!

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
OUR PERSONAL BEHAVIOR IS

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
NOT THE MAIN CULPRIT HERE,

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
DESPITE WHAT THE PLASTICS

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
INDUSTRY HAS SPENT DECADES,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
AND MILLIONS OF

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
DOLLARS TRYING TO CONVINCE US.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
SO YES, WE SHOULDN'T BE USING

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
SINGLE-USE PLASTICS LIKE

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
GROCERY BAGS OR TAKE-OUT

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
CONTAINERS -- REDUCING THAT

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, AS

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
NEARLY HALF OF THE PLASTIC WASTE

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
GENERATED GLOBALLY IN 2015 WAS

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
PLASTIC PACKAGING, MOST OF IT

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
SINGLE USE.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
BUT IT CAN BE HARD, ON AN

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, TO END THEIR

29:04.000 --> 29:04.000
USE.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
A BETTER MOVE WOULD BE TO

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
IMPLEMENT SMART, THOUGHTFUL,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
TARGETED BANS THAT FORCE THE

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
INTRODUCTION OF ALTERNATIVES.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
AND TO THEIR CREDIT, MANY CITIES

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
HAVE BANNED SINGLE-USE PLASTIC

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
BAGS.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
UNFORTUNATELY, THE INDUSTRY HAS

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
FOUGHT THOSE BANS HARD,

29:21.000 --> 29:21.000
EVEN LOBBYING SOME STATE

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
LEGISLATURES, TO THE

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
POINT THAT EIGHTEEN STATES NOW

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
HAVE PREEMPTIVE LAWS STOPPING

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
LOCAL REGULATION.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
WHICH IS A BIT WEIRD.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
I GUESS THOSE STATES JUST HAVE

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
A HARD-ON FOR PLASTIC BAGS NOT

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
SEEN SINCE THAT CREEPY KID FROM

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
"AMERICAN BEAUTY."

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
THE KID LOVED.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
SO WHAT CAN WE REALLY DO HERE?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
WELL, THE REAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
HAS TO COME FROM PLASTICS

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
MANUFACTURERS THEMSELVES.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
WITHOUT THAT, NOTHING

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
SIGNIFICANT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM INTERNALIZE

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
THE COSTS OF THE POLLUTION THAT

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
THEY ARE CREATING.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
AND THERE IS A WAY TO DO THIS,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
THROUGH A CONCEPT CALLED

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
"EXTENDED PRODUCER

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
RESPONSIBILITY" OR

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
"THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE."

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
THE IDEA IS TO CREATE LAWS

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
THAT ESSENTIALLY SHIFT

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE COSTS OF

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
COLLECTION, FROM THE PUBLIC

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
SECTOR AND ALL OF US TO THE

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
ACTUAL PRODUCERS OF THE PLASTIC

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
WASTE.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
EPR LAWS COULD, AMONG OTHER

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
THINGS, FORCE COMPANIES TO

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
EITHER CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
AND MARKETS TO RECYCLE THE

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
PRODUCTS THEY MAKE, OR FORCE

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
THEM TO STOP MAKING THEM

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
ALTOGETHER.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
THE U.S. IS ONE OF THE ONLY

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ON EARTH

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
WITHOUT A NATIONAL EPR LAW

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
ADDRESSING PACKAGING.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT IS.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
BUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
SEVERAL STATES ARE CURRENTLY

30:29.000 --> 30:29.000
CONSIDERING EPR LAWS, AND THERE

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
WAS EVEN A NATIONAL LAW

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
INTRODUCED IN THE LAST CONGRESS.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
IT WENT NOWHERE, BUT IT'LL SOON

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
BE INTRODUCED AGAIN, AND WE'RE

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
GOING TO NEED SOME VERSION OF AN

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
EPR LAW TO PASS, AND SOON.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM'S GETTING

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
WORSE.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
PLASTIC PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
TO TRIPLE BY 2050.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT MEANINGFUL

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
CHANGE IS ONLY GOING TO COME

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
THROUGH BEING ABLE TO FORCE

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
THIS VERY POWERFUL INDUSTRY TO

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
DO THINGS THAT IT'S SHOWN FOR

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
HALF A CENTURY IT HAS ABSOLUTELY

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
NO INTEREST IN DOING.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM CHANGE --

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
AND IF NOT FOR OUR SAKE, OR THE

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
SAKE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS,

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
LET'S AT LEAST DO IT FOR ALL

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
THE FISH WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
OUTNUMBERED BY PLASTIC

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
IN THE OCEAN.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
>> JUST LIKE ME!

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, JOHN?

31:14.000 --> 31:14.000
>> John: EXACTLY, SLURP,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
JUST LIKE YOU!

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANK YOU SO

31:18.000 --> 31:18.000
MUCH FOR WATCHING.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK, SO WE'LL

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
SEE YOU IN TWO WEEKS' TIME.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.000
>> A HIATUS?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
ALREADY?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
JESUS.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
GOD ALMIGHTY, JOHN.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
C'MON, JOHN, BUCKLE DOWN.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
YOU'VE GOT MORE WRITERS THAN

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
THE JONESTOWN MASSACRE.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
MY GOD!

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
>> John: SLURP, IT'S A VERY

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
INTENSIVE PRODUCTION.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
OUR STAFF IS ENTITLED

31:36.000 --> 31:36.000
TO A BREAK.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
SEE YOU ALL APRIL 4th.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
GOOD NIGHT! >> HEY!

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
LOOK AT ME, EVERYBODY!

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
YOU'RE THINKING I LOOK LIKE

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
SOMETHING ANOTHER FISH COUGHED

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
UP.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
HUH?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
THAT MY HEAD LOOKS LIKE A BASKET

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
INGREDIENT FROM "CHOPPED."

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
YEAH, OKAY.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
TO EVERYBODY OUT THERE

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
ON THE INTERNET WHO SAID I LOOK

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
LIKE TED CRUZ, REMEMBER:

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I GOT FEELINGS.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
AND YOU'VE HURT THEM.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
GOOD NIGHT.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I LOVE YOU ALL.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
MIAMI BEACH IS THE GREATEST

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD!

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
MWAH!

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
GOOD NIGHT!
