WEBVTT

00:13.325 --> 00:14.742
Get the hell off me!

00:22.167 --> 00:24.252
Get up! Stand up!

00:24.254 --> 00:26.671
Stand up. Stand up.
Stand up. Come on!

00:26.673 --> 00:28.089
Let go of me!

00:28.091 --> 00:30.424
Stand up! Hey!

00:36.315 --> 00:38.065
I don't care
how you do it.

00:38.067 --> 00:40.151
Issue a shipwide
announcement if you have to.

00:40.153 --> 00:42.553
Just find him.
Aye, Master Chief.

00:44.222 --> 00:47.742
Officer on deck.

00:48.527 --> 00:50.561
As you were.

00:50.563 --> 00:52.530
With me, Chief.

00:52.532 --> 00:54.081
I understand
we had a situation

00:54.083 --> 00:55.866
in the Enlisted Galley
this morning.

00:55.868 --> 00:58.452
I'm sure they were just
letting off a little steam, sir.

00:58.454 --> 00:59.954
The crew's probably
a little stressed

00:59.956 --> 01:01.339
from the
extended mission.

01:01.341 --> 01:04.257
Oh, you and I both know
that's no excuse, Master Chief.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.510
If they're stressed now,
what the hell are they going

01:06.512 --> 01:08.045
to be like
in a combat situation?

01:08.047 --> 01:10.131
I want to read
the NCIS report.

01:10.133 --> 01:12.350
That makes two of us, sir.

01:14.686 --> 01:16.938
We still can't find
the Special Agent Afloat.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.108
Find him.

01:21.110 --> 01:23.361
Would NCIS
Special Agent Afloat Niles

01:23.363 --> 01:26.948
please contact
the watch commander?

02:08.508 --> 02:10.708
What's wrong
with your hat?

02:12.728 --> 02:15.045
I don't get it.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.350
Hetty, I-I can
explain. Uh...

02:19.352 --> 02:21.602
Actually, no,
this is my fault.

02:21.604 --> 02:24.021
I asked Eric to help me out
with the Toys for Tots program

02:24.023 --> 02:25.656
I'm doing for the Marine Corps,
and, well, I thought

02:25.658 --> 02:27.658
it would be fun for the kids
if we were dressed up.

02:27.660 --> 02:29.994
Yes. It sounds wonderful.

02:29.996 --> 02:31.746
But I'm afraid
it'll have to wait.

02:33.215 --> 02:34.615
We've lost one of our own.

02:34.617 --> 02:36.834
Rally the troops.

02:40.756 --> 02:42.757
Mr. Beale?

02:42.759 --> 02:44.742
You have, um,

02:44.744 --> 02:47.261
elf head.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.101
So, Christmas is
less than a week away.

02:54.103 --> 02:56.854
One of the very few holidays
we get off, if we're lucky.

02:56.856 --> 02:58.272
And you have no plans?
Nope.

02:58.274 --> 03:00.191
Swear?
Yes.

03:00.193 --> 03:01.726
Perfect.
No.

03:01.728 --> 03:03.027
Yes!

03:03.029 --> 03:06.263
No, no, nono, because I have
chosen not to do anything.

03:06.265 --> 03:07.648
It was not by default.

03:07.650 --> 03:10.534
I have made a conscious choice
not to do anything on Christmas.

03:10.536 --> 03:11.652
Also known as step one

03:11.654 --> 03:13.454
to become the crazy lady
with 30 cats.

03:13.456 --> 03:15.823
Kensi, think about this.
Lake Tahoe.

03:15.825 --> 03:19.293
Ski-in, ski-out cabin.
Six feet of fresh powder.

03:19.295 --> 03:21.996
Snowboarding during day,
roaring fire at night.

03:21.998 --> 03:23.631
I don't think so.

03:23.633 --> 03:24.782
Do you suck?

03:24.784 --> 03:27.618
Excuse me?

03:27.620 --> 03:29.453
At snowboarding?

03:29.455 --> 03:31.889
just know it takes a lot
of coordination.

03:31.891 --> 03:34.058
Maybe we could get you,
like, a toboggan.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.810
I can snowboard.

03:35.812 --> 03:37.478
They have a bunny hill.
I don't need a bunny hill.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.629
What are you so afraid of?

03:38.631 --> 03:39.897
I'm not afraid of anything.

03:39.899 --> 03:42.016
I could kick your ass
anytime, anywhere.

03:42.018 --> 03:43.434
This...

03:43.436 --> 03:44.968
double-black-diamond rated.

03:44.970 --> 03:46.103
There is no doubt in my mind

03:46.105 --> 03:47.772
that that is
double-black-diamond rated.

03:47.774 --> 03:49.973
Plus, I told my mom
I'd spend Christmas with her.

03:49.975 --> 03:51.308
Well, then, she should come.

03:51.310 --> 03:52.860
It's a three-bedroom cabin.

03:52.862 --> 03:54.278
Two of which are connected.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.496
Don't even think about it.

03:55.498 --> 03:57.198
For your mom.
Ew!

03:57.200 --> 03:59.083
And you, so you guys
could have adjoining rooms.

03:59.085 --> 04:00.251
What are you thinking?

04:00.253 --> 04:01.318
Nothing.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.504
I bet you were.

04:07.009 --> 04:10.594
It might actually be nice to
give my mom a little vacation.

04:10.596 --> 04:12.496
And what's better
than a white Christmas?

04:12.498 --> 04:14.515
Just the three of us,
hanging out...

04:14.517 --> 04:15.666
sipping hot cocoa,

04:15.668 --> 04:19.937
watching the snow fall
on the cedars.

04:21.773 --> 04:23.173
From the hot tub.
Oh!

04:23.175 --> 04:24.842
You had to go there.
What?

04:24.844 --> 04:25.843
She's a stone-cold fox.

04:25.845 --> 04:26.944
You ruined it!
I didn't.

04:26.946 --> 04:28.863
I made it better.
Didn't I, Nell?

04:28.865 --> 04:30.681
Hetty needs you guys up in Ops.

04:30.683 --> 04:32.516
Great.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.354
Hetty needs you guys up in Ops.

04:37.356 --> 04:39.790
Okay, we'll be right there.

04:39.792 --> 04:42.159
Can I help you with something?

04:42.161 --> 04:44.194
You could, if he knew
what he was looking for

04:44.196 --> 04:45.296
or where he put it.

04:46.699 --> 04:48.082
I didn't want
to go through that whole

04:48.084 --> 04:49.467
Parker Pony thing
like I did last year,

04:49.469 --> 04:51.001
so I asked my daughter
what she wanted

04:51.003 --> 04:52.636
for Christmas in June,
and then I went out

04:52.638 --> 04:54.055
to buy it right away.

04:54.057 --> 04:55.923
He hid it
so she wouldn't find it.

04:55.925 --> 05:00.544
Of course, as we know,
the memory is the first to go.

05:01.897 --> 05:03.848
I think it had something
to do with Harry Potter.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.266
A wand?

05:05.268 --> 05:06.233
No.

05:06.235 --> 05:07.234
How about an owl?

05:07.236 --> 05:08.569
No.
No?

05:08.571 --> 05:09.653
A sorting hat?

05:09.655 --> 05:10.654
A what?

05:10.656 --> 05:11.655
A broom?

05:11.657 --> 05:12.740
You're not helping.

05:12.742 --> 05:15.225
Eh, I'm not really trying.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.862
Who we looking at, Eric?

05:17.864 --> 05:20.664
Jason Niles was the NCIS
Special Agent Afloat

05:20.666 --> 05:22.116
on the <i>USS Van Buren.</i>

05:22.118 --> 05:23.901
He was discovered
dead yesterday.

05:23.903 --> 05:26.420
Cause of death was
blunt force trauma,

05:26.422 --> 05:29.239
either from a fall or a
deliberate bludgeoning.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.074
Any witnesses?
No.

05:31.076 --> 05:32.176
Suspects?

05:32.178 --> 05:33.711
Possibly one.

05:33.713 --> 05:37.014
Petty Officer Simon Allen is
an intelligence specialist.

05:37.016 --> 05:39.183
Now, according to
Agent Niles's last report,

05:39.185 --> 05:41.251
he was keeping an eye
on Petty Officer Allen

05:41.253 --> 05:43.204
for "erratic behavior."

05:43.206 --> 05:45.923
What does that mean?
Well, he doesn't specify in his log

05:45.925 --> 05:49.560
but Petty Officer Allen
is currently in the brig

05:49.562 --> 05:52.029
following an altercation
with a Marine staff sergeant

05:52.031 --> 05:55.432
on the same morning
that the body was found.

05:55.434 --> 05:56.817
What were they fighting about?

05:56.819 --> 05:58.035
Not sure.

05:58.037 --> 06:01.238
But both men tested
positive for cocaine use.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.406
Where's the <i>Van Buren</i> now?

06:02.408 --> 06:04.325
It's on its way to
the Sea of Japan

06:04.327 --> 06:06.076
to keep North
Korea in line.

06:06.078 --> 06:07.995
So then, what are
we supposed to do?

06:07.997 --> 06:10.164
What you do best.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.500
Solve the crime.

06:12.502 --> 06:17.471
I've already arranged for you
all to be flown out to the ship.

06:17.473 --> 06:21.091
Christmas is
going to have to wait.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.170
Wow.

06:32.172 --> 06:33.272
Hello, sailor.

06:33.274 --> 06:36.191
I'm a Marine major.

06:36.193 --> 06:37.426
You're a major hotty.

06:37.428 --> 06:39.795
Oh. Those are some
cool costumes.

06:39.797 --> 06:42.264
Uniform.
They're not costumes, Deeks.

06:42.266 --> 06:45.284
We're going in as crew members,
and Callen's going in as

06:45.286 --> 06:47.286
the replacement
for the NCIS Agent Afloat.

06:47.288 --> 06:48.904
Mm-hmm. So what's my cover?

06:48.906 --> 06:50.372
You, my friend,

06:50.374 --> 06:52.875
are a civilian contractor
doing a computer upgrade.

06:52.877 --> 06:55.127
A geek?

06:55.129 --> 06:56.829
This is all I get?
This, like, clipboard?

06:56.831 --> 06:59.214
There are over 5,000
people on board.

06:59.216 --> 07:01.467
Going in as different
elements of the crew

07:01.469 --> 07:03.135
will allow us to
cover more ground.

07:03.137 --> 07:05.838
Mm-hmm. Just for the record,
this is a gross misuse

07:05.840 --> 07:07.172
of my undercover talents.

07:07.174 --> 07:11.010
Well, if you truly
feel that way, Mr. Deeks,

07:11.012 --> 07:13.846
you can go in
as a Marine, as well.

07:13.848 --> 07:15.814
All right.
Just let me get

07:15.816 --> 07:17.599
my clippers.
What?

07:17.601 --> 07:18.767
Clippers?

07:18.769 --> 07:19.985
Ooh, you're gonna look so good

07:19.987 --> 07:20.986
with a high and tight.

07:20.988 --> 07:22.104
No, no. No, no, no, no, wait.

07:22.106 --> 07:23.489
Just got to do a little, uh,

07:23.491 --> 07:25.441
sense memory work for my
undercover character, you know.

07:25.443 --> 07:27.609
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

07:27.611 --> 07:28.744
Acting, ha!

07:28.746 --> 07:31.080
Chopper's here
to take us to Coronado.

07:34.501 --> 07:36.919
I know that look.

07:38.738 --> 07:40.339
You're starting
to sound like my wife.

07:40.341 --> 07:42.174
You know what they
say when your partner

07:42.176 --> 07:43.542
starts sounding
like your wife?

07:43.544 --> 07:44.710
Get a new wife?

07:44.712 --> 07:46.345
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

07:46.347 --> 07:47.763
See, that's the problem
right there.

07:47.765 --> 07:49.247
You and I don't talk.

07:49.249 --> 07:51.934
Communication goes, the
relationship is soon to follow.

07:51.936 --> 07:53.218
Almost finished?

07:53.220 --> 07:54.470
Just about.

07:54.472 --> 07:57.639
Look, I know you want
to be home for Christmas.

07:57.641 --> 07:59.858
I've missed Christmas,
graduations, birthdays

07:59.860 --> 08:02.194
and everything else
doing what we do.

08:02.196 --> 08:04.313
Then what is it?

08:11.437 --> 08:13.372
Sidirov.

08:13.374 --> 08:16.992
What if he comes back
while we're away?

08:16.994 --> 08:19.795
Then Michelle will do
what she has to do.

08:19.797 --> 08:21.997
Same is if
you were here.

08:21.999 --> 08:24.633
Yeah. But I won't be.

08:24.635 --> 08:25.801
Then we'll make this quick.

08:25.803 --> 08:26.969
Besides, I guarantee you,

08:26.971 --> 08:28.804
Sidirov isn't showing up
here anytime soon.

08:28.806 --> 08:30.255
How can you be so sure?

08:30.257 --> 08:34.243
Criminals take Christmas off
just like the rest of us.

08:34.245 --> 08:35.727
Even the bad guys
don't like

08:35.729 --> 08:37.563
being on the naughty list.

08:43.686 --> 08:45.687
<i>The Navy has a budget</i>

08:45.689 --> 08:50.275
of $155 billion, and <i>this</i>
is the plane that they use?

08:50.277 --> 08:52.638
C2 Greyhound--
workhorse of the sea.

08:52.663 --> 08:53.530
Mm-hmm.

08:53.531 --> 08:56.915
Yeah, well, this horse needs
to be sent to the glue factory.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.168
It's probably the safest plane
you'll ever fly in.

08:59.170 --> 09:00.819
Th-This is the
safe... Really?

09:00.821 --> 09:03.372
Okay, explain to me, then,
why we're wearing helmets

09:03.374 --> 09:04.790
and life preservers.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.542
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but the only time

09:06.544 --> 09:08.210
to wear a life preserver
is in the event

09:08.212 --> 09:10.495
of a water landing.
So tell me, do they know something

09:10.497 --> 09:11.847
that we don't know?

09:11.849 --> 09:14.049
There is nothing
to be afraid of, Deeks.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.218
What? I'm not.
I have hardened nerves of steel.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.970
I just think it's
a little disconcerting

09:17.972 --> 09:20.639
the back of the plane
opens like my garage door.

09:20.641 --> 09:22.441
It's like
a flying tool shed.

09:22.443 --> 09:23.976
Deeks?
Yeah?

09:23.978 --> 09:25.277
I'm trying to sleep here.

09:25.279 --> 09:27.179
Okay. Well,
I'll be sure to wake you up

09:27.181 --> 09:28.313
when we crash into the ocean.

09:28.315 --> 09:30.866
Hey, just try and relax,
Maverick.

09:30.868 --> 09:32.350
Huh? Did you hear that?

09:32.352 --> 09:35.287
I look a little <i>Top Gun</i>
in this thing, don't I?

09:44.464 --> 09:46.915
Hey, I gathered a bunch
of disciplinary reports

09:46.917 --> 09:48.667
from the last several months.

09:48.669 --> 09:50.702
Trying to find anyone
who might have a grudge

09:50.704 --> 09:52.254
against Special Agent Niles.

09:52.256 --> 09:54.423
That sounds good.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.176
You okay?

09:57.178 --> 09:59.678
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

10:01.014 --> 10:02.547
Nell?

10:05.185 --> 10:06.985
Nellie?

10:08.238 --> 10:10.405
Nellster...

10:11.725 --> 10:14.993
It's just... I was
really looking forward

10:14.995 --> 10:17.729
to the holiday party
and the Secret Santa stuff.

10:17.731 --> 10:20.916
It's... it's stupid.

10:23.002 --> 10:25.454
I don't think so.

10:25.456 --> 10:28.740
I'm so... I just get
like this around the holidays.

10:28.742 --> 10:32.211
'Cause I... I can't be home.

10:33.379 --> 10:36.798
And it's like
these people we work with,

10:36.800 --> 10:38.884
they become...

10:38.886 --> 10:42.721
our surrogate family,
and they're not here right now.

10:42.723 --> 10:44.723
They'll be back soon.

10:44.725 --> 10:47.192
And you know what,
even if they're not,

10:47.194 --> 10:51.313
I promise that we will have
a festive holiday celebration.

10:53.267 --> 10:56.434
I mean, I've agreed
to wear an elf hat,

10:56.436 --> 10:58.787
so...
And the ears?

10:58.789 --> 11:00.622
I'm sorry, the what?

11:00.624 --> 11:03.542
You have to wear the elf ears.

11:03.544 --> 11:07.129
Um, I don't think I remember
you saying anything about any...

11:07.131 --> 11:08.380
Oh, come on.

11:08.382 --> 11:11.466
Hey, what's an elf
without ears, right?

11:11.468 --> 11:13.135
Exactly.

11:21.060 --> 11:24.596
Prepare for landing.

11:32.772 --> 11:34.606
<i>Piece of cake!</i>
<i>I don't know what</i>

11:34.608 --> 11:36.641
you guys were so worried about.

11:36.643 --> 11:38.744
Welcome aboard the USS
<i>Van Buren,</i> ma'am, sirs.

11:38.746 --> 11:40.245
I'm Petty Officer Smalls.

11:40.247 --> 11:41.997
Can I point you in the right
direction, Commander?

11:41.999 --> 11:43.415
No, I'm good, thanks.
Special Agent Callen,

11:43.417 --> 11:45.334
would you like to be taken
to the NCIS office?

11:45.336 --> 11:46.818
Actually, I'm headed
to the brig first,

11:46.820 --> 11:48.036
but can find my way. Thanks.

11:48.038 --> 11:50.455
You must be Mr. Colter,

11:50.457 --> 11:52.341
the data entry systems analyst.

11:52.343 --> 11:53.675
Well, you say "day-ta,"
I say data--

11:53.677 --> 11:55.677
I say we split the difference
and call it a date.

11:55.679 --> 11:57.662
I'm the ship's
civilian personnel liaison.

11:57.664 --> 11:59.014
I'll be your escort.

11:59.016 --> 12:01.433
Someone should be here
to meet you momentarily, ma'am.

12:01.435 --> 12:02.500
Thank you.

12:02.502 --> 12:03.602
Fantastic.

12:04.972 --> 12:07.505
I don't know if you,
uh, overheard that,

12:07.507 --> 12:09.858
but I have a, uh, escort.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.311
Fraternization is forbidden
on board, Deeks.

12:12.313 --> 12:14.196
Wow, jealous much?

12:15.031 --> 12:17.733
Major Barret?

12:17.735 --> 12:20.035
Please excuse
my tardiness, ma'am.

12:20.037 --> 12:21.353
I'm Lieutenant
Abernathy.

12:21.355 --> 12:22.520
Welcome aboard.

12:22.522 --> 12:23.989
Thank you, Lieutenant.

12:23.991 --> 12:25.324
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you

12:25.326 --> 12:26.825
to your berthing.
You can get squared away

12:26.827 --> 12:28.693
before you muster on station.
Yes.

12:28.695 --> 12:31.213
So what, they found
the missing link.

12:32.915 --> 12:34.045
Are you coming,
Mr. Colter?

12:34.070 --> 12:36.002
Oh. Colter, no.
Please call me Marty.

12:36.003 --> 12:37.502
And I should
call you...?

12:37.504 --> 12:39.221
Petty Officer Smalls
will suffice, sir.

12:40.591 --> 12:42.140
All right.

12:42.142 --> 12:45.260
So, what were you and
Staff Sergeant Jefferies fighting about?

12:45.262 --> 12:47.562
I don't know, sir.
It was stupid.

12:47.564 --> 12:49.748
I mean, you know
what the Marines are like.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.401
"Oorah" this and
"oorah" that.

12:52.403 --> 12:53.819
Sometimes it just gets
a little tiresome

12:53.821 --> 12:55.237
and you have to stand up to them

12:55.239 --> 12:57.105
or else they walk around
like they own the place.

12:57.107 --> 12:59.358
You two have a history?

12:59.360 --> 13:00.442
Absolutely not, sir.

13:00.444 --> 13:02.394
I couldn't
pick him out of a lineup.

13:02.396 --> 13:04.079
He and his boys
were lipping off,

13:04.081 --> 13:05.580
so I told them to shut it.

13:05.582 --> 13:07.165
Next think you know,
he's tackling me.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.334
Guess he figured he
had something to prove.

13:09.336 --> 13:11.803
Did this fight have anything
to do with cocaine?

13:11.805 --> 13:13.738
I can't speak
for Petty Officer Allen,

13:13.740 --> 13:16.541
but I did not,
nor have I ever used cocaine.

13:16.543 --> 13:18.677
Then how do you explain
your drug test?

13:18.679 --> 13:20.462
It must be a
mistake, sir.

13:20.464 --> 13:22.347
I'd gladly be retested.

13:22.349 --> 13:24.599
Oh, so you test negative now
that it's out of your system?

13:24.601 --> 13:26.601
It was never in
my system, sir.

13:26.603 --> 13:28.553
I'm no angel,
Agent Callen,

13:28.555 --> 13:31.473
but I'll take a lie detector
to prove I'm no drug user.

13:31.475 --> 13:33.558
My father and my uncle
were Marines.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.394
I would never disrespect
this uniform,

13:35.396 --> 13:38.864
this ship or my family
by doing something so stupid.

13:40.933 --> 13:44.286
What's your relationship with
the NCIS Special Agent Afloat

13:44.288 --> 13:45.287
Jason Niles?

13:45.289 --> 13:47.572
I never even knew

13:47.574 --> 13:50.575
who he was until I heard
he was reported dead.

13:50.577 --> 13:52.577
Yeah, I-I only
met him once.

13:52.579 --> 13:56.047
He intervened in an argument
I was having a few days ago.

13:56.049 --> 13:57.666
What was the argument about?

13:57.668 --> 14:00.635
It was music.
Some E3 was in the library

14:00.637 --> 14:02.587
listening to music
with his headphones,

14:02.589 --> 14:05.674
but he had the tunes cranked so
loud, it was bugging everybody.

14:05.676 --> 14:07.625
Where were you yesterday

14:07.627 --> 14:11.229
prior to the...
altercation in the galley?

14:11.231 --> 14:13.181
Fire safety drills.

14:13.183 --> 14:14.966
I had the morning watch.

14:14.968 --> 14:16.651
Which ends at 8:00?
Yes, sir.

14:16.653 --> 14:18.487
The fight took place
just after 9:00,

14:18.489 --> 14:20.805
so what were you doing
for the hour in-between?

14:20.807 --> 14:22.858
Uh, usually I would
jog around the deck,

14:22.860 --> 14:24.776
but flight operations
were in full swing,

14:24.778 --> 14:26.912
so I just walked
below deck.

14:26.914 --> 14:30.248
Uh-huh. Why didn't you use
the treadmills in the gym?

14:30.250 --> 14:34.336
I always feel like
a hamster on those things, sir.

14:34.338 --> 14:35.754
Anyone see you?

14:35.756 --> 14:37.539
Uh, yeah, sure,
lots of people.

14:37.541 --> 14:40.675
Anyone see you around the...
zero-two-tack-

14:40.677 --> 14:43.962
one-eight-two-tack-
six-tango section of the ship?

14:43.964 --> 14:46.097
I-I can't be sure, sir.

14:46.099 --> 14:48.333
Where exactly is that?

14:50.470 --> 14:53.271
Where the body
was found.

14:56.776 --> 14:58.527
The bull's-eyes
tell you where you are

14:58.529 --> 15:01.146
Deck, frame, relation
to centerline and compartment.

15:01.148 --> 15:02.981
Numbers increase
as you go aft.

15:02.983 --> 15:05.283
Even numbers are port,
odd numbers are starboard.

15:05.285 --> 15:07.819
Starbucks?
S-Starboard.

15:07.821 --> 15:10.021
No, I mean, is there
a Starbucks on board?

15:10.023 --> 15:12.240
Or a Coffee Bean?

15:12.242 --> 15:14.059
Panda Express?
T.G.I. Fridays?

15:14.061 --> 15:15.410
Froyo?

15:15.412 --> 15:16.912
Enlisted Mess is

15:16.914 --> 15:18.129
on the second level.

15:18.131 --> 15:20.198
The Dirty Shirt Room,
Wardroom One, is forward

15:20.200 --> 15:21.583
on the O3 level.

15:21.585 --> 15:23.418
Chief's Mess has
the best food,

15:23.420 --> 15:25.053
but you have to be invited.

15:25.055 --> 15:27.639
If you'll follow me
this way, Mr. Colter...

15:27.641 --> 15:30.375
Mr. Colter? Hello?

16:02.259 --> 16:04.009
What's up there, sailors?

16:04.011 --> 16:06.845
Nothing to see here.

16:13.936 --> 16:15.687
What the... what?

16:22.645 --> 16:26.531
What the hell are you doing?
Me? No. I was just...

16:26.533 --> 16:28.149
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

16:28.151 --> 16:29.985
I got lost coming
around one of these corners.

16:29.987 --> 16:31.653
I found myself in the basement
of the <i>Titanic.</i>

16:31.655 --> 16:33.288
Seriously, I think
I just saw Kate Winslet.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.907
She was naked.
You should check it... out.

16:37.277 --> 16:38.293
Hey, I see how this is--

16:38.295 --> 16:40.161
you guys, uh,
want to haze the swabbie.

16:40.163 --> 16:40.991
Here's the problem--

16:41.016 --> 16:42.965
I'm a private contractor,
which means you can't

16:42.966 --> 16:44.966
dress me up like a sea hag,
or whatever it is

16:44.968 --> 16:46.918
you and your seaman
buddy here do for fun.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.628
What the hell
is going on in here?

16:58.014 --> 17:00.932
He was creeping around where
we found that NCIS agent dead, sir.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.485
Sir, you know what they
say about criminals,

17:03.487 --> 17:05.270
always returning
to the scene of the crime.

17:05.271 --> 17:06.271
Yeah, except for Matlock,

17:06.296 --> 17:08.185
I'm pretty sure no one
actually says that.

17:11.993 --> 17:13.810
I'll take him from here.

17:20.153 --> 17:22.252
They're gone.

17:22.255 --> 17:24.623
I just need...
Come on, Deeks,

17:24.625 --> 17:26.590
pull your skirt down--
I hardly hit you.

17:26.593 --> 17:30.095
I know, I was...
I was just in character.

17:30.097 --> 17:31.429
It's fine. I'm fine.

17:31.431 --> 17:33.765
You've been on the ship
less than an hour,

17:33.767 --> 17:36.051
and you're already in trouble.
Yeah, I know,

17:36.053 --> 17:37.469
but I found evidence.

17:37.471 --> 17:38.720
Special Agent Niles

17:38.722 --> 17:41.106
was killed on
a different part of the ship,

17:41.108 --> 17:43.308
and then his body
was dragged here.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.712
<i>These are the sailors</i>
<i>who attacked Deeks.</i>

17:59.714 --> 18:02.598
Both men have had minor
incidents while on shore leave,

18:02.600 --> 18:04.267
but both occurred
before Agent Niles

18:04.269 --> 18:05.685
was assigned to their vessel.

18:05.687 --> 18:07.019
Does either man have
a connection

18:07.021 --> 18:07.937
with Special Agent Niles?

18:07.939 --> 18:09.322
Nothing we've
found so far.

18:09.324 --> 18:11.824
Neither one was noted
in any of Niles' files.

18:11.826 --> 18:14.410
However, one of the men,
Petty Officer Lambert,

18:14.412 --> 18:17.246
worked in Intelligence
with Petty Officer Allen.

18:17.248 --> 18:19.944
All right. See if there's
any other dots to connect.

18:19.969 --> 18:21.969
On it.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.537
So Deeks thinks
Special Agent Niles

18:24.539 --> 18:26.072
was killed
elsewhere on the ship

18:26.074 --> 18:28.107
and then dumped
where his body was found.

18:28.109 --> 18:30.042
The body showed signs
of massive blunt-force trauma

18:30.044 --> 18:31.944
with a distinctive
wound pattern, but there is

18:31.946 --> 18:33.579
nothing in the area
where we found him

18:33.581 --> 18:35.131
that would account
for that sort of injury.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.350
Well, it could've been done
by the weapon the killer used

18:37.352 --> 18:39.602
or some other piece
of equipment he had on.

18:39.604 --> 18:42.688
Except for the fact...
that I found this.

18:42.690 --> 18:44.056
What is it?

18:44.058 --> 18:45.808
That, my friend, is spinach,
or Swiss chard,

18:45.810 --> 18:47.310
possibly kale--
but I think it's spinach

18:47.312 --> 18:48.761
because I nibbled it
a little bit

18:48.763 --> 18:50.029
and it tasted like spinach.

18:50.031 --> 18:52.782
Let me see that.
It's called detective work, boys.

18:52.784 --> 18:55.201
Yeah, I see where
you're going with this.

18:55.203 --> 18:58.487
Popeye ate spinach,
Popeye was a sailor, so...

18:58.489 --> 19:01.040
we're looking for a crew member
with giant forearms,

19:01.042 --> 19:03.826
smoking a pipe.
Why, I oughta...

19:03.828 --> 19:05.077
It could've
come off anyone's shoe.

19:05.079 --> 19:06.295
Could' fallen
out of the trash.

19:06.297 --> 19:09.114
That's true, except for--
wait for it--

19:09.116 --> 19:11.784
this.

19:11.786 --> 19:15.004
One and... two.

19:15.006 --> 19:16.055
Okay.

19:16.057 --> 19:17.807
Wardroom, messes.

19:17.809 --> 19:19.124
This...

19:19.126 --> 19:20.676
is where we found the body.

19:20.678 --> 19:23.012
It's the other side of the ship.
Uh-huh, exactly.

19:23.014 --> 19:25.147
So if you think about all
the passageways and the ladders,

19:25.149 --> 19:28.184
it would be almost impossible
for <i>this</i> to get from one side

19:28.186 --> 19:29.819
of the ship to the other...

19:29.821 --> 19:32.188
without being scraped
off somebody's boot.

19:32.190 --> 19:35.191
It would be improbable,
but not impossible.

19:35.193 --> 19:38.027
What's impossible is to kill
somebody in the galley,

19:38.029 --> 19:39.578
then drag the corpse
through the entire ship

19:39.580 --> 19:40.579
without being seen.

19:40.581 --> 19:41.747
Mm-hmm. How do you
account for that?

19:41.749 --> 19:43.165
I don't have
to account for that--

19:43.167 --> 19:44.817
I'm the one that
found the spinach.

19:44.819 --> 19:46.252
What'd you guys find, huh?

19:46.254 --> 19:48.153
More importantly,
what did Kensi find?

19:48.155 --> 19:50.840
Oh. Kensi found something.
Mm-hmm.

19:50.842 --> 19:54.176
Yeah. Six-two and looks
like a male model.

19:54.178 --> 19:56.328
That's right.
What?

19:56.330 --> 19:58.347
That guy?
That guy's not her type.

19:58.349 --> 20:01.217
He's a Marine.
Really?

20:01.219 --> 20:03.269
Her father was a Marine.

20:03.271 --> 20:04.770
Girls love their daddies.

20:04.772 --> 20:06.138
Yep.

20:06.140 --> 20:06.956
Oorah.

20:06.958 --> 20:10.226
Okay. Good talk.

20:10.228 --> 20:12.111
Do you know Staff
Sergeant Jefferies?

20:12.113 --> 20:13.195
He's serving aboard.

20:13.197 --> 20:15.114
I know <i>of</i> him, ma'am.
Why?

20:15.116 --> 20:17.066
Oh, we're just from
the same hometown

20:17.068 --> 20:18.534
and have mutual
family friends.

20:18.536 --> 20:20.286
I was hoping
to say hello.

20:20.288 --> 20:22.571
But, uh, I hear
he's in the brig.

20:22.573 --> 20:25.491
I think he and one of
the crew got into a scuffle.

20:25.493 --> 20:28.377
That doesn't sound like
the Jefferies I remember.

20:28.379 --> 20:29.862
I'm sure it was nothing
serious, ma'am.

20:29.864 --> 20:31.297
By the end
of a long deployment

20:31.299 --> 20:32.965
everybody's ready to get off
this ship, and having our mission

20:32.967 --> 20:35.051
suddenly extended seemed
to shorten everyone's fuse.

20:39.139 --> 20:40.389
Master Chief!

20:40.391 --> 20:41.507
Master Chief.

20:42.844 --> 20:45.711
Let's talk
about this!

20:46.646 --> 20:48.547
I need a security force
to the ready room.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.984
Come on!

20:53.955 --> 20:56.405
Down!
I need a security force

20:56.407 --> 20:57.656
down here!

20:57.658 --> 20:58.941
Don't touch that!
It's evidence!

20:58.943 --> 21:00.910
Don't touch it!

21:01.778 --> 21:03.746
The lab tested it.

21:03.748 --> 21:06.999
No signs of Niles' hair,
blood, DNA, nothing.

21:07.001 --> 21:08.868
They could've
wiped it clean.

21:08.870 --> 21:11.587
Yeah, it also doesn't
match his head wound.

21:12.589 --> 21:14.590
How's the master chief doing?

21:14.592 --> 21:16.292
Still a little out of it.

21:16.294 --> 21:17.743
What the hell happened?

21:17.745 --> 21:19.879
The senior medical officer

21:19.881 --> 21:22.098
believes that
his altered mental state

21:22.100 --> 21:25.384
was caused by...
cocaine toxicity.

21:29.523 --> 21:31.590
You're way out of line,
Mr. Callen.

21:31.592 --> 21:33.091
It's "Special
Agent Callen""

21:33.093 --> 21:34.810
I've known the
master chief for years.

21:34.812 --> 21:36.712
I'll take his word
over yours any day.

21:36.714 --> 21:39.365
How about the word of your
chief medical officer?

21:39.367 --> 21:41.700
Drug tests don't lie.

21:41.702 --> 21:43.035
No, but they can be wrong.

21:43.037 --> 21:44.787
Then how do you explain
your master chief

21:44.789 --> 21:46.405
attacking crew members
with a wrench?!

21:46.407 --> 21:48.324
With all due
respect, sir,

21:48.326 --> 21:50.609
your ship has a
serious drug problem.

21:50.611 --> 21:53.295
Oh, so first you try and tell me
I got a killer on board,

21:53.297 --> 21:54.630
and now a bunch of drug addicts.

21:54.632 --> 21:56.081
I'm not trying
to tell you anything.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.334
The evidence...
Agent Niles could have fallen down

21:58.336 --> 22:00.553
and hit his head,
for all I know!

22:00.555 --> 22:01.804
All you have are allegations,

22:01.806 --> 22:03.439
and if you're
gonna keep making 'em,

22:03.441 --> 22:06.291
you sure as hell better have
something to back 'em up.

22:06.293 --> 22:10.813
Aircraft carrier is one of the
most dangerous places on the planet,

22:10.815 --> 22:13.098
especially if you're
careless or stupid.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.818
Now, you seem relatively
smart for a civilian,

22:15.820 --> 22:17.937
so I'd suggest
you be careful.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.248
Sorry I'm late;
I got hung up.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.534
How'd you make out
with the XO?

22:31.536 --> 22:33.652
Not as well as I'd hoped--
he basically threatened me.

22:33.654 --> 22:34.870
You think
he's involved?

22:34.872 --> 22:35.955
Nah, I doubt it.

22:35.957 --> 22:38.257
Can't blame the XO
for his behavior.

22:38.259 --> 22:40.459
Everyone on board
is a reflection on him.

22:40.461 --> 22:42.261
His career's
on the line.

22:42.263 --> 22:44.430
Somebody smuggled
the drugs on board

22:44.432 --> 22:45.681
and is now dealing.

22:45.683 --> 22:46.966
NCIS Agent Afloat Niles

22:46.968 --> 22:48.300
obviously came close
to finding out

22:48.302 --> 22:50.219
who that is,
and it got him killed.

22:50.221 --> 22:52.855
It sounds like we got to lean
on those that tested positive.

22:52.857 --> 22:54.339
Both of them
denied using.

22:54.341 --> 22:56.275
Well, they usually do.

22:56.277 --> 22:58.176
We need to search the ship.

22:58.178 --> 22:59.511
You want to search this?

22:59.513 --> 23:01.513
That's like searching Cleveland.
This place is huge.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.115
I didn't say
it would be easy.

23:03.117 --> 23:05.067
But the act alone might
force whoever's behind this

23:05.069 --> 23:07.319
to get nervous and make a mistake.
Okay. I'll ask

23:07.321 --> 23:09.121
to be assigned
to the security search force.

23:09.123 --> 23:11.240
I'll keep digging
through the 4,000-plus crew.

23:11.242 --> 23:13.042
If I let those
in custody think

23:13.044 --> 23:14.860
we're getting close
to finding the source,

23:14.862 --> 23:17.046
they may start talking
to cut a deal first.

23:17.048 --> 23:20.082
- I'll keep working my lead.
- What's your lead?

23:20.084 --> 23:22.218
Funny you should ask.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.639
What's this?

23:23.664 --> 23:25.171
That right there is
a little trace evidence

23:25.172 --> 23:27.172
I found at the crime scene.
Spinach.

23:27.174 --> 23:29.808
Or as I like to call it,
"forensic botany."

23:29.810 --> 23:31.977
No, it's called spinach.
Whatever.

23:31.979 --> 23:34.680
It's difficult to stay
in touch on the ship,

23:34.682 --> 23:37.433
so it's gonna be extra hard
to cover each other's back.

23:37.435 --> 23:38.851
Let's be extra careful.

23:38.853 --> 23:41.503
We already lost
one NCIS agent.

23:57.649 --> 23:58.634
I'm gonna need you

23:58.635 --> 24:00.284
to level with me,
Lieutenant.

24:00.286 --> 24:02.220
Is drug use a common
problem on this ship?

24:02.222 --> 24:03.555
Not that
I'm aware of, Major.

24:03.557 --> 24:05.890
The skipper runs a
tight ship, and dope's

24:05.892 --> 24:07.976
a serious violation.
Well, how hard can it be

24:07.978 --> 24:10.111
to sneak a little cocaine
onto a ship this size?

24:10.113 --> 24:12.280
We only do random searches
around the clock,

24:12.282 --> 24:14.649
especially on those people
returning from liberty.

24:14.651 --> 24:17.652
Okay. How would you
explain what's happening?

24:17.654 --> 24:19.854
Wish I had an
answer, Major,

24:19.856 --> 24:21.406
especially for
the master chief.

24:21.408 --> 24:23.775
He's probably one of the most
squared-away sailors

24:23.777 --> 24:26.327
I've ever met.

24:28.665 --> 24:31.482
What is it, Lieutenant?

24:31.484 --> 24:32.917
Nothing, ma'am.

24:32.919 --> 24:35.453
I told you to level with me--
that's an order.

24:35.455 --> 24:36.788
I did, ma'am.

24:36.790 --> 24:39.490
If you're hiding something from me...
I-I'm not,

24:39.492 --> 24:41.593
ma'am, it's just...

24:41.595 --> 24:43.712
Please, uh, don't take this
the wrong way, Major,

24:43.714 --> 24:45.797
but you don't seem
like a very...

24:45.799 --> 24:47.165
I mean, you do,

24:47.167 --> 24:51.102
and you don't, and I am just
way out of line-- I'm sorry.

24:51.104 --> 24:53.104
Relax.

24:54.190 --> 24:55.356
Ow!

24:55.358 --> 24:56.558
Watch your head, sir.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.776
Yeah, that's, uh...

24:57.778 --> 25:00.862
why they call it
"forewarning" there, Smalls.

25:03.515 --> 25:07.368
These really necessary, sir?

25:07.370 --> 25:09.120
You tell me.

25:09.955 --> 25:11.656
First rule of
behavioral analysis

25:11.658 --> 25:13.958
is that the best predictor

25:13.960 --> 25:16.461
of future violence
is past violence.

25:16.463 --> 25:19.247
You have no history
of violence.

25:19.249 --> 25:21.532
Care to explain?

25:21.534 --> 25:23.334
I've always taken
full responsibility

25:23.336 --> 25:28.139
for my actions
and those who serve under me.

25:28.141 --> 25:31.893
But I got to be honest
with you, sir.

25:31.895 --> 25:34.145
I have no idea what happened.

25:34.147 --> 25:38.983
Medical report says it was
a cocaine-induced psychosis.

25:38.985 --> 25:41.820
That's-that's
just not possible, sir.

25:41.822 --> 25:44.489
You sure about that,
Master Chief?

25:46.725 --> 25:49.744
Because if it wasn't the drugs,
how do you explain

25:49.746 --> 25:53.865
attacking several crew members
and two officers with a wrench?

25:55.701 --> 25:58.586
I can't.

25:58.588 --> 26:00.255
You trying
to silence your dealer

26:00.257 --> 26:01.539
before we found him out?

26:01.541 --> 26:03.374
No.

26:03.376 --> 26:05.260
Let me see your arms.

26:20.092 --> 26:23.027
Put your head back.

26:23.029 --> 26:25.897
You can check between
my toes, my gums,

26:25.899 --> 26:27.899
anywhere you like,

26:27.901 --> 26:29.818
you're not gonna
find anything.

26:29.820 --> 26:33.738
I have to set an example for the men
and women on this ship,

26:33.740 --> 26:34.906
and I do.

26:34.908 --> 26:37.075
I don't drink, I don't smoke,

26:37.077 --> 26:39.160
and I don't do drugs.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.746
Hell, I don't even eat red meat.

26:41.748 --> 26:44.282
Do you have any enemies
on this ship?

26:45.751 --> 26:49.053
I'd like to think not.

26:49.055 --> 26:52.090
The average age
of the crew member on this ship

26:52.092 --> 26:53.474
is 19 years old.

26:53.476 --> 26:56.060
It's my job to help
train them to operate

26:56.062 --> 26:58.897
the most powerful weapon
in the world.

26:58.899 --> 27:03.735
That takes discipline
and responsibility.

27:03.737 --> 27:05.303
And yes...

27:05.305 --> 27:07.805
sometimes there is friction.

27:07.807 --> 27:09.190
Enough that one or more of them

27:09.192 --> 27:11.276
would want to see you
busted for drug use,

27:11.278 --> 27:13.444
maybe even OD?

27:22.705 --> 27:25.089
It's a little early
for Secret Santa, isn't it?

27:25.925 --> 27:27.842
Open it.

27:30.162 --> 27:32.013
Okay.

27:35.184 --> 27:37.969
Uh-huh.

27:47.029 --> 27:48.512
No.

27:49.398 --> 27:50.848
No, no.

27:50.850 --> 27:53.067
This was not part of our deal.

27:53.069 --> 27:55.153
You never said anything about...

27:55.155 --> 27:56.454
panty hose.

27:56.456 --> 28:00.358
Okay, they're leggings,
not panty hose,

28:00.360 --> 28:02.360
and it's part
of your costume.

28:02.362 --> 28:03.795
What it is,

28:03.797 --> 28:06.364
is a death sentence
if Callen, Sam or Deeks

28:06.366 --> 28:07.832
ever saw me wearing them.

28:07.834 --> 28:09.884
It's gonna be fun.
Wha...

28:09.886 --> 28:13.838
No. I am all for helping
children, but...

28:13.840 --> 28:17.375
I'm sorry, I cannot do this.

28:17.377 --> 28:20.211
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

28:21.046 --> 28:22.730
You wear polar bear

28:22.732 --> 28:24.515
and Spiderman pajamas.

28:24.517 --> 28:25.733
Spiderman is cool,

28:25.735 --> 28:26.884
and polar bear...

28:26.886 --> 28:28.653
It's different, okay?

28:28.655 --> 28:31.189
I-I wear those
in the privacy of my own home.

28:31.191 --> 28:33.358
People are going
to see me in this.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.692
There will be kids

28:34.694 --> 28:37.028
and the taking of pictures,
and next thing I know

28:37.030 --> 28:38.696
it'll be on Facebook,
and then... and then...

28:38.698 --> 28:40.748
and then a video on YouTube,
then it goes viral,

28:40.750 --> 28:43.167
then they stat playing it
on a loop on the big screen,

28:43.169 --> 28:44.841
and, oh, my God, Sam is
calling me Elfie McBeal...

28:44.866 --> 28:46.255
Okay, you know what?

28:46.256 --> 28:48.572
You don't have to wear it.

28:51.927 --> 28:53.678
Forget it.

28:55.214 --> 28:57.248
Wai...

29:07.609 --> 29:09.861
What now?

29:09.863 --> 29:11.279
Two pilots were scrubbed

29:11.281 --> 29:13.597
from flight
operations this morning...

29:13.599 --> 29:15.766
due to "illness""

29:15.768 --> 29:16.784
Cocaine?

29:16.786 --> 29:18.102
Haven't heard yet,
but the scuttlebutt

29:18.104 --> 29:20.204
around the ship
is that flight operations

29:20.206 --> 29:21.572
might be suspended.

29:22.858 --> 29:26.361
You get anything
from the chief?

29:26.363 --> 29:28.579
Nothing but denial.

29:28.581 --> 29:30.965
I got to say, I believe him.

29:30.967 --> 29:33.584
This guy's service record's
cleaner than yours <i>or</i> mine.

29:33.586 --> 29:34.886
Well...

29:34.888 --> 29:37.972
definitely mine.

29:37.974 --> 29:41.125
You think a disgruntled sailor
could be trying to set him up?

29:41.127 --> 29:42.927
Possibly.

29:42.929 --> 29:45.630
Doesn't explain the pilots.

29:45.632 --> 29:48.983
Uncle Sam spends millions
to train these guys.

29:48.985 --> 29:52.236
They bust their asses
to get a chance to do this.

29:52.238 --> 29:54.188
They're the best of the best.

29:54.190 --> 29:57.191
Everyone I've questioned
has been exemplary.

29:57.193 --> 30:00.144
And none of them have asked
for a JAG lawyer.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.746
They all seem more concerned

30:01.748 --> 30:04.165
about their careers
than anything else.

30:04.167 --> 30:06.084
Exactly like the XO.

30:06.086 --> 30:08.052
Not what you would expect

30:08.054 --> 30:10.654
from someone who knows
they're guilty.

30:11.490 --> 30:13.591
Nope.

30:16.328 --> 30:19.130
Do you think someone could
have unknowingly drugged them?

30:19.132 --> 30:24.052
Could they be trying to sabotage
the ship and her mission?

30:24.054 --> 30:25.803
The flight operations
are grounded--

30:25.805 --> 30:28.056
they've already
succeeded.

30:29.608 --> 30:31.826
There's something else.

30:33.862 --> 30:36.147
I can't reach my wife.

30:42.905 --> 30:45.039
...safety team
to the ordnance elevator.

30:45.041 --> 30:46.491
On the double.

30:49.495 --> 30:51.329
Well, ahoy, mateys.

30:51.331 --> 30:53.381
Can we help you?

30:53.383 --> 30:55.383
Yeah, I'm just looking
for the ship's stores.

30:55.385 --> 30:56.834
Well, you're looking at them.

30:56.836 --> 30:58.419
Thought you would've
learned your lesson

30:58.421 --> 30:59.587
about snooping around.

30:59.589 --> 31:01.089
Keep it up,

31:01.091 --> 31:03.541
you're gonna end up
in sickbay, like your buddy.

31:03.543 --> 31:05.593
What's that? Oh, yeah,
you guys didn't stick around

31:05.595 --> 31:07.929
long enough to see me
kick his ass, did you?

31:07.931 --> 31:10.398
Hold on, guys, I don't know
what's going on here,

31:10.400 --> 31:11.933
but if we don't get this thing
up and going again,

31:11.935 --> 31:13.484
you're all gonna be eating
salmonella salad.

31:13.486 --> 31:15.219
Yeah, well, if the damn thing
wouldn't keep breaking down,

31:15.221 --> 31:16.687
then we wouldn't have
to keep fixing it.

31:16.689 --> 31:18.356
What seems to be the problem?

31:18.358 --> 31:20.575
No problem--
we just had a faulty

31:20.577 --> 31:22.560
refrigeration unit,
that's all.

31:22.562 --> 31:24.779
They flew another one in.
Uh-huh.

31:24.781 --> 31:26.497
I think I shared a seat with it.

31:26.499 --> 31:28.583
All right, well, listen,
I'm gonna take a look around

31:28.585 --> 31:30.084
if nobody has
a problem with that.

31:30.086 --> 31:33.037
You two? Show of hands? Okay.

31:50.755 --> 31:53.757
Looks like we got it:
Colonel Mustard, on the ship...

31:55.060 --> 31:57.261
...with a pipe valve.

31:58.897 --> 32:02.150
Wow, wouldn't want my head
smashed into that.

32:34.899 --> 32:38.095
How long does it take Eric to
send a damn car to my house?

32:38.195 --> 32:39.445
Maybe she wasn't home?

32:39.447 --> 32:40.396
Then, where is she?

32:40.398 --> 32:41.613
Sam...

32:41.615 --> 32:44.149
if Sidirov was back in the
country, we would know.

32:44.151 --> 32:46.601
The minute he contacts
Michelle, bells go off

32:46.603 --> 32:48.370
with us and the CIA.

32:48.372 --> 32:50.038
Guys.
You find her?

32:50.040 --> 32:53.959
Not yet, but initial forensics
suggest we got a match.

32:53.961 --> 32:54.910
Match for what?

32:54.912 --> 32:56.412
The photo that Deeks sent.

32:56.414 --> 32:59.164
It matches the head wound
that killed Agent Niles.

32:59.166 --> 33:00.716
Deeks found
the murder weapon?

33:00.718 --> 33:01.800
Looks that way.

33:01.802 --> 33:04.169
Some sort of pipe valve.

33:04.171 --> 33:05.220
Where?

33:05.222 --> 33:06.638
I don't know.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.057
He hasn't answered
my last few e-mails.

33:09.893 --> 33:11.176
If Deeks found
the murder site,

33:11.178 --> 33:14.229
he could have found the thing
that got Agent Niles killed.

33:14.231 --> 33:16.648
Can you determine where on the
ship the photos were taken?

33:16.650 --> 33:18.884
It'll be tough since
the paint schematics are uniform

33:18.886 --> 33:20.552
throughout the ship,
but I'll cross-reference

33:20.554 --> 33:23.021
with the plumbing schematics,
see what I find.

33:23.023 --> 33:25.941
Alert Kensi, you call us,
you find anything else.

33:25.943 --> 33:27.159
Got it.

33:27.161 --> 33:28.477
If you wanted
to poison the crew,

33:28.479 --> 33:29.611
you only have a few options:

33:29.613 --> 33:34.116
air, water, food, or some sort
of surface contact.

33:34.118 --> 33:36.034
If Deeks was following up
on his spinach clue,

33:36.036 --> 33:37.002
he was probably snooping

33:37.004 --> 33:38.837
around the food
stores on the ship.

33:38.839 --> 33:42.090
Nobody knows the ship better
than the command master chief.

33:42.092 --> 33:43.208
He could pinpoint
the location.

33:43.210 --> 33:44.676
All right,
I'll show him the photo.

33:44.678 --> 33:45.711
You find Kens.

33:45.713 --> 33:47.429
Open it.

33:47.431 --> 33:48.847
Sir.

33:49.832 --> 33:51.833
You know where this is?

33:51.835 --> 33:53.502
It's a main steam valve.

33:53.504 --> 33:56.004
They're all over the ship.
In food stores?

33:56.006 --> 33:57.856
Yes, sir.
Show me.

34:12.121 --> 34:15.090
You got this?
Yes, ma'am.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.342
<i>Make way!</i>

34:18.344 --> 34:20.913
Coming through!

34:25.168 --> 34:27.202
Hey, what the
hell's going on?

34:27.204 --> 34:28.370
Deeks found
the murder weapon,

34:28.371 --> 34:29.888
but now we can't reach him.

34:31.306 --> 34:33.809
Would Commander Hanna
and Major Barret please report

34:33.811 --> 34:38.397
to zero-two-tack-one-four-four-
tack-seven-Lima compartment?

34:38.399 --> 34:40.599
This way.

34:45.221 --> 34:47.438
Is this what
you're looking for?

34:48.658 --> 34:51.726
It's consistent with the photos
of the victim's wounds.

34:51.728 --> 34:53.445
Callen?

34:53.447 --> 34:55.364
Did you find him?

34:55.366 --> 34:58.000
No, but I think
we're in the right spot.

34:59.035 --> 35:00.619
Deeks?

35:01.337 --> 35:03.422
Hey... you boys see

35:03.424 --> 35:05.123
the guy you were beating up on
yesterday?

35:05.125 --> 35:07.125
The guy who kicked
your ass, sir?

35:07.127 --> 35:08.293
He what?

35:08.295 --> 35:10.045
Do you see
where he went?

35:10.047 --> 35:12.381
He was snooping around
here a few minutes ago.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.467
Hey, hold up a second.

35:15.469 --> 35:17.970
Yo, with the trash!

35:19.722 --> 35:21.756
Go, go! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

35:21.758 --> 35:23.609
Federal agents!
Deeks...

36:01.098 --> 36:03.682
Shooter's down, G.

36:04.517 --> 36:07.436
Like that little
bank shot, huh?

36:07.438 --> 36:09.638
Little eight ball,
corner pocket?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.073
Yeah, I taught you that.

36:11.075 --> 36:12.190
You didn't teach me that.

36:12.192 --> 36:13.909
I definitely taught you that.

36:13.911 --> 36:16.411
You say <i>my</i> memory's going.

36:18.332 --> 36:20.165
I know it's needless to say,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

36:20.167 --> 36:21.700
Thank you.

36:21.702 --> 36:24.586
Couldn't let him throw away
a perfectly good partner.

36:24.588 --> 36:25.537
Did you get him?

36:25.539 --> 36:26.838
Yep.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.090
Is he talking?

36:28.092 --> 36:30.042
Not so much; he's dead.

36:30.044 --> 36:31.510
Master Chief,
could you secure the body?

36:31.512 --> 36:33.211
Yes, sir.

36:33.913 --> 36:36.632
You here and you with me.

36:36.634 --> 36:38.934
Come on.

36:38.936 --> 36:41.553
Okay, so we know where
they killed Agent Niles,

36:41.555 --> 36:43.004
but still no drugs.

36:43.006 --> 36:44.673
Well, it seems
like somebody's been sabotaging

36:44.675 --> 36:47.442
the refrigeration unit
on these storage containers.

36:50.313 --> 36:52.531
K-9s already
searched that area.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.568
Maybe they were sabotaging the
refrigeration unit so the food

36:56.570 --> 36:57.703
would spoil, you know?

36:57.705 --> 36:59.738
The smell
would throw off the dogs.

36:59.740 --> 37:02.374
It's not that easy.

37:06.045 --> 37:09.214
Fresh paint.

37:16.506 --> 37:17.422
What?

37:17.424 --> 37:18.640
It's in the paint?

37:18.642 --> 37:20.342
Wow, they're good.

37:20.344 --> 37:22.377
You got to be
kidding me.

37:22.379 --> 37:25.847
They're really good.

37:28.685 --> 37:30.686
Damn.

37:30.688 --> 37:33.522
Sam?

37:33.524 --> 37:35.440
It's Michelle.

37:35.442 --> 37:37.909
Everything all right?

37:37.911 --> 37:40.862
She was at a friend's house
finishing up costumes

37:40.864 --> 37:42.330
for the kids' play.

37:42.332 --> 37:44.950
Totally forgot about
the Christmas pageant.

37:44.952 --> 37:46.535
What'd I tell you?

37:46.537 --> 37:48.537
You said she'd be all right.

37:48.539 --> 37:51.373
I also said the memory
is the first to go.

37:54.627 --> 37:56.545
I said it.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.598
<i>Leonard Wall is</i>

37:59.600 --> 38:02.584
a produce supplier
who recently won a Navy contract

38:02.586 --> 38:05.887
by significantly underbidding
everyone else.

38:05.889 --> 38:07.689
He could afford to lose money
on the produce

38:07.691 --> 38:09.691
because he was using the Navy
to transport his drugs.

38:09.693 --> 38:11.526
The ship's lab confirmed
that the paint

38:11.528 --> 38:12.944
in the container
was, like,

38:12.946 --> 38:16.481
a highly concentrated cocaine-
hydrochloride mixture.

38:16.483 --> 38:17.899
Drug dogs
can't smell it.

38:17.901 --> 38:19.568
Yeah, it was
a pretty good plan,

38:19.570 --> 38:21.386
but what
he did not consider

38:21.388 --> 38:23.822
was that the coke mixture
would leach into the produce.

38:23.824 --> 38:26.158
All crew members
were potentially exposed.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.160
Cocaine toxicity can be
potentially lethal,

38:28.162 --> 38:29.611
can also cause

38:29.613 --> 38:31.580
severe behavioral changes
like we saw in the master chief,

38:31.582 --> 38:33.131
which proves

38:33.133 --> 38:36.585
my theory that eating healthy
is not only boring,

38:36.587 --> 38:37.786
it's downright dangerous.

38:37.788 --> 38:40.806
Uh, Hetty has arranged
an NCIS Red Team

38:40.808 --> 38:44.125
in Okinawa to meet the ship
and surreptitiously track

38:44.127 --> 38:46.961
the container
when it's off-loaded in Japan,

38:46.963 --> 38:48.780
so that we can intercept
the drugs

38:48.782 --> 38:50.348
at their final destination.

38:50.350 --> 38:53.018
So it looks
like we're going home.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.637
Right, Eric?

38:55.639 --> 38:56.772
Uh, absolutely.

38:56.774 --> 38:59.274
I've already processed
your travel orders.

38:59.276 --> 39:00.358
When?

39:00.360 --> 39:02.527
I'd say, uh, about an hour ago.

39:02.529 --> 39:03.862
When are we leaving?

39:03.864 --> 39:07.249
Look, guys, uh,
in the spirit of the season,

39:07.251 --> 39:09.234
please don't hate me.

39:09.236 --> 39:13.171
I tried everything,
I called in every favor I could,

39:13.173 --> 39:15.590
but the earliest
I can get you guys all home

39:15.592 --> 39:19.177
to Los Angeles is...
December 27.

39:19.179 --> 39:20.212
What?

39:20.214 --> 39:23.632
What, no, n-n-no snow,
no hot tub?

39:23.634 --> 39:25.183
Hetty can pull some strings.

39:25.185 --> 39:27.219
She's already left
for the break.

39:27.221 --> 39:29.888
I'm sorry,
she abandoned us at sea?

39:29.890 --> 39:31.106
You know,
if it's any consolation,

39:31.108 --> 39:32.841
she waited
until the case was wrapped

39:32.843 --> 39:35.026
and knew you were all safe
before she left.

39:35.028 --> 39:36.278
Why is it that,
every time you ask

39:36.280 --> 39:38.513
if it's any consolation,
it's not.

39:38.515 --> 39:41.016
Eric, don't sweat it.

39:41.018 --> 39:42.651
We know you worked hard--
enjoy your holidays.

39:42.653 --> 39:44.703
Thanks, guys.
You, too.

39:44.705 --> 39:47.155
And, again, I'm really sorry.

39:49.076 --> 39:51.910
♪

39:53.663 --> 39:58.333
Well, y'all mocked my forensic
botany, but in the end...

39:58.335 --> 40:00.185
Your spinach played
a vital role.

40:00.187 --> 40:01.469
Thank you,
thank you for that.

40:01.471 --> 40:02.671
Was that so, uh,

40:02.673 --> 40:03.872
so hard, huh?

40:03.874 --> 40:06.224
Actually, don't beat
yourself up too much.

40:06.226 --> 40:09.377
After all, I am the only person
here that's an actual detective.

40:09.379 --> 40:11.513
That's because
we're special agents.

40:11.515 --> 40:13.214
Yeah, well, where I grew up,
"special" meant

40:13.216 --> 40:15.884
that you took the short bus and
wore a helmet in the sandbox.

40:15.886 --> 40:17.986
That's almost as funny as you
telling those two sailors

40:17.988 --> 40:19.654
you kicked my ass.

40:19.656 --> 40:21.106
Really?

40:21.108 --> 40:22.357
You said that?

40:22.359 --> 40:24.576
I didn't;
my undercover character did.

40:24.578 --> 40:25.610
Right.
Ah.

40:25.612 --> 40:27.195
Gentlemen,

40:27.197 --> 40:28.196
ma'am...

40:28.198 --> 40:29.331
I want to thank you

40:29.333 --> 40:30.332
for everything you've done

40:30.334 --> 40:32.784
for the ship,
the crew and...

40:32.786 --> 40:34.402
especially myself.

40:34.404 --> 40:36.204
It's our pleasure,
Command Master Chief.

40:36.206 --> 40:38.256
I'm sorry that this
has adversely affected

40:38.258 --> 40:40.408
your holiday plans with your
family, but, uh, at least

40:40.410 --> 40:41.943
you can have some eggnog
and Christmas dinner.

40:41.945 --> 40:45.463
The cook staff pulls out all
the stops for the holidays.

40:45.465 --> 40:46.915
That sounds fantastic.
Thank you, sir.

40:46.917 --> 40:48.016
Thank you very much.

40:48.018 --> 40:49.801
Thank you.

40:49.803 --> 40:51.353
Officer on deck.

40:51.355 --> 40:53.355
As you were.

40:56.309 --> 40:57.559
Hetty.

40:57.561 --> 40:58.810
Merry Christmas.

40:58.812 --> 40:59.574
What?

40:59.599 --> 41:01.088
We thought you
were on vacation.

41:01.188 --> 41:02.898
I was on my
way to Macao

41:02.899 --> 41:04.232
for the holidays

41:04.234 --> 41:05.633
and I decided to make

41:05.635 --> 41:07.185
a pit stop here.

41:08.487 --> 41:11.506
There is an F-18
Super Hornet up on deck

41:11.508 --> 41:14.075
for a return flight
to Coronado.

41:14.077 --> 41:16.194
The backseat is
empty, Mr. Hanna.

41:16.196 --> 41:19.114
If you were to
leave right now,

41:19.116 --> 41:22.500
you could make it home
by Christmas morning.

41:22.502 --> 41:23.585
For real?

41:23.587 --> 41:25.920
Have I ever lied to you?

41:27.373 --> 41:28.923
Oh, whoa!
I love you, Hetty.

41:28.925 --> 41:29.707
Oh.

41:29.709 --> 41:31.709
Mwah!
Uh...

41:33.013 --> 41:33.995
Now put me down...

41:36.933 --> 41:37.765
Thank you, sir.

41:37.767 --> 41:39.100
Get out of here already.

41:39.102 --> 41:40.168
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, indeed.

41:40.170 --> 41:41.719
Merry Christmas.
Bye, Sam!

41:41.721 --> 41:43.188
Now, who's got

41:43.190 --> 41:44.556
the eggnog?

41:51.063 --> 41:53.114
Merry Christmas.

41:57.186 --> 42:00.238
Whoa, you look...

42:00.240 --> 42:01.789
Elfin?

42:01.791 --> 42:03.241
Elfin amazing.

42:04.244 --> 42:06.244
I don't know what to say.

42:06.246 --> 42:08.663
Well, I believe the
traditional greeting

42:08.665 --> 42:10.248
is "Merry Christmas"--

42:10.250 --> 42:15.303
"Happy holidays" if you're
feeling politically correct.

42:23.979 --> 42:27.732
What was... that?

42:35.859 --> 42:39.861
Uh, I hope you have
a really nice holiday

42:39.863 --> 42:45.016
and I will...
see you next year.

42:47.753 --> 42:49.403
Hey, hey, wait, you know what?

42:49.405 --> 42:51.264
I'm just gonna go get my tights.

42:51.265 --> 42:52.768
They're called leggings.

42:55.213 --> 42:57.175
Oh, and don't forget your ears.
