WEBVTT

00:30.197 --> 00:35.032
HAPPINESS IS NOT ALWAYS FUN

00:45.212 --> 00:49.171
ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL

02:25.729 --> 02:26.718
Yes?

02:26.813 --> 02:31.056
Excuse me,
but it’s raining so hard outside.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.102
And I thought, “Emmi,

02:35.197 --> 02:37.062
better get inside that bar.”

02:37.949 --> 02:41.362
I pass by here every evening
and hear that foreign music.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.370
What language are they singing in?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.114
Arabic.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.165
Arabic. | see.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.754
We have German stuff
in the jukebox, too. Nearly half.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.001
But of course they prefer
the stuff from back home.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.009
Of course.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.933
What would you like to drink?

03:09.106 --> 03:12.189
What do people usually have?

03:12.275 --> 03:16.814
All sorts of things.
Whatever you like. Cola or beer.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.691
That sounds good, thanks.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.780
What then? Beer or cola?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.775
A cola, please.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.625
She’s nuts. Talks a blue streak.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.499
Maybe she never gets
a chance to talk othenNise.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.204
Probably.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.851
- Well, are you coming or not?
- No.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.350
- And why not?
- Cock broken.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.687
- Another beer?
- Sure.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.396
Two beers.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.783
How much?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.830
- For nine beers?
- Yes, nine beers.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.582
Ten marks, 80.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.462
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.777
Why don’t you dance
with the old girl?

04:48.872 --> 04:51.659
Me dance with old woman?

04:51.792 --> 04:54.204
Why not?
Your legs aren’t broken, are they?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.955
What’s up?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.753
She says I should dance
with old woman.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.138
- You dance with me?
- What? Dance?

05:16.274 --> 05:19.983
Yes. You sit alone. Sad.
Not good sitting alone.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.526
Why not?

05:21.655 --> 05:25.147
It must be all of 20 years
since I last danced.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.444
Maybe I can’t anymore.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.323
Don’t matter. Dance very slow.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.506
Turn the lights off.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.017
Where are you from?

05:58.149 --> 06:00.606
Little town in Morocco — Tismit.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.394
Oh, Morocco.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.068
Yes. Very nice, but no work.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.529
You speak German well.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.277
Been here long?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.533
Two years. Much work.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.451
Me, too.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.537
Half of life consists of work.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.678
You have no man? Married?

06:40.442 --> 06:42.307
What do you do?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.360
Work on cars.
All day, all time.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.656
And you spend your evenings here?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.483
Yes.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.409
Good music,

06:53.538 --> 06:55.153
Arab buddies.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.034
Don’t know other places.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.207
Germans with Arabs not good.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.250
Why?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.203
Don’t know.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.630
Germans not same people as Arabs.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.429
- But at work surely...
- Not the same.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.305
German master.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.177
Arab dog.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.604
- But that...
- Who cares?

07:22.567 --> 07:26.025
Better not think too much.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.353
Think much, cry much.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.970
- Here.
- Thanks.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.516
- Like another drink?
- No, thanks.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.890
l have to get up early.
I’d like to pay for the cola.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.941
- One mark.
- Me pay cola.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.643
Here.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.611
Thanks a lot, but...

08:10.699 --> 08:13.406
You talk good with Ali.
Ali pay cola.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.710
- Your name’s Ali?
- Not Ali, but everyone says Ali.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.250
Now I am Ali.
- What’s your real name?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.423
El Hedi ben Salem M’Barek
Mohammed Mustapha.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.674
- That’s pretty long.
- Yes. In Tismit all names long.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.847
I’m afraid I have to go now.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.512
Good-bye.
- Not good-bye.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.847
I go home with you to door.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.557
Not going alone,

08:47.694 --> 08:49.150
better.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.691
If you like.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.210
This awful rain.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.128
Here we are.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.966
- This your house?
- Yes.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.507
You can wait here a minute.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.968
Maybe the rain will stop.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.725
Othen/vise you’ll catch cold,
and it’ll be my fault.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.848
What work you do?

09:28.943 --> 09:32.231
Well, you know...

09:34.032 --> 09:34.817
Yes?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.482
I don’t like to say.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.568
People always give you
such a funny look.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.573
Me not look funny.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.823
No, not you.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.751
Well, I clean.
I’m a cleaning lady.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.494
In big company?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.751
Not too big,
but there’s a lot of glass.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.499
It’s hard work.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.220
There are four of us
to clean eight ﬂoors.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.673
We do two each,

10:01.768 --> 10:04.054
one in the morning
and one in the evening.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.142
In between, I’m free
to do private jobs.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.105
They’re always looking
for cleaners nowadays.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.525
I never learned a proper trade.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.861
You wouldn’t believe
some of the things that happen.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.617
One employer sends for me
in his Mercedes.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.410
With a chauffeur.

10:26.501 --> 10:29.368
Who am I to refuse?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.623
He has a factory or something.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.294
You should wear
lighter-colored suits, Ali.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.883
They’d look better on you.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.634
Me? Light suits? Why?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.885
It’s none of my business,

10:43.977 --> 10:48.141
but dark clothes look so sad,
don’t they?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.639
Don’t know. Maybe.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.609
It’s good to talk with someone.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.312
I’m alone most of the time.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.489
All the time, really.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.067
My children have their own lives.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.495
You have many children?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.787
Three. Two sons and a daughter.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.580
They’re all married.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.495
Where? Other town?

11:14.591 --> 11:16.331
No, here.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.842
But they live their own lives.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.342
We get together
on special occasions, but...

11:23.474 --> 11:25.135
With us in Morocco,

11:25.226 --> 11:28.138
family always together.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.936
Mama never alone.
Mama alone, not good.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.270
Other countries have other customs.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.315
I’ll go see if the rain’s stopped.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.195
It’s still pouring.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.744
Maybe...
- Yes?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.663
Why don’t you come up for a while?
I’ll make us a coffee,

11:52.754 --> 11:55.712
and maybe the rain will stop.

11:55.840 --> 12:01.255
- I’d like to, but...
- People always say “but.”

12:01.387 --> 12:03.252
And nothing ever changes.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.630
Come on up!

12:05.725 --> 12:08.307
I’ve got a bottle of brandy.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.885
A Christmas present
from my oldest son.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.729
You like brandy?
- Brandy? Yes.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.522
There you are.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.104
It’s no fun drinking alone.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.669
Good evening, Mrs. Kurowski.

12:45.390 --> 12:50.259
I wanted to give you
the three marks, 50 that I owe you.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.862
There. And thanks a lot.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.439
Thanks. Good night.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.281
Good night.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.366
Come on up.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.799
- Mrs. Karges?
- Imagine!

13:30.935 --> 13:33.301
Mrs. Kurowski’s got
a foreigner up there.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.011
What?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.480
- A black man.
- Real black?

13:37.608 --> 13:40.896
Well, not that black,
but pretty dark.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.852
She’s not really German herself.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.695
With a name like Kurowski!

13:44.824 --> 13:47.486
What are things coming to?

13:47.577 --> 13:49.863
I wonder what she’s up to with him.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.783
No idea.
Maybe she’s buying a carpet.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.119
At 9:30 at night?

13:56.210 --> 13:57.825
Who knows?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.248
Good night, Mrs. Karges.
- Good night.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.166
Very good coffee.

14:05.970 --> 14:10.088
My family says Emmi’s coffee
is enough to wake the dead.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.180
Would you like some brandy with it?

14:12.310 --> 14:13.925
Please.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.304
My husband was Polish,

14:17.398 --> 14:19.104
not German.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.854
He was a foreign worker
during the war.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.105
He just stayed on aftenlvards.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.608
My parents were still alive then.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.409
They said, “Emmi,

14:32.538 --> 14:34.403
this’ll come to no good.”

14:37.251 --> 14:39.537
That’s because he was a foreigner,

14:40.129 --> 14:42.211
you see?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.293
Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.297
My father hated all foreigners.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.256
He was a party member,
Hitler’s party.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.724
You know who Hitler was?
- Hitler? Yes.

14:55.686 --> 14:59.725
I was in the party, too.
Everyone was, or almost everyone.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.473
But Frantizek and I got along ﬁne.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.729
That was my husband’s name.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.942
But then he started
having liver trouble.

15:09.075 --> 15:13.409
He always drank too much.
But he was always a lot of fun.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.279
He died in 1955.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.744
Oh, well. Another drink?
- Yes.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.623
- And you? Are you married?
- Not married.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.463
And your parents?

15:29.804 --> 15:32.090
- Parents dead.
- Both of them?

15:32.223 --> 15:34.965
Papa very old. Mama very sick.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.932
Any brothers or sisters?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.681
- No brother. Five sisters.
- Five?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.639
Five sisters. Ali smallest.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.731
AII sisters older.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.810
And they’re all still in Morocco?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.653
Not just Morocco.
Algeria, Tunisia.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.818
Papa go walking with camels.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.819
Papa Berber.
Berber walk all over Africa.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.284
Ali must go now. Very late.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.787
Have another drink.
Just ten more minutes.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.374
Last tram now.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.130
Tram go, All walk home.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.633
- Where do you live?
- Very far. Hofmann Strasse.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.177
Do you have a room there?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.801
Yes, with ﬁve friends from work.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.727
Six in small room.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.475
Six men in one small room?

16:23.608 --> 16:26.099
Three beds here, three beds there.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.809
- KI'f-kl'f
- What’s kif-kif?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.310
“Who cares” in Arabic.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.442
That’s funny.

16:32.533 --> 16:36.572
But six men in one room,
that’s inhuman.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.948
Arabs not human in Germany.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.158
Different earlier. But since
catastrophe in Munich, not good.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.627
You know what? Have another drink,
and I’ll ﬁx you up a bed.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.251
You can sleep here tonight.
- Ali sleep here?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.049
Because you have such a long way,

16:52.178 --> 16:55.011
and there are six in a room,
and because you’re nice.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.596
- You nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.389
When do you start work?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.601
At 6:30.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.520
Good. Me too.
We can have breakfast together.

17:04.607 --> 17:08.065
I’ll get your bed ready.
Have another drink.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.908
The bathroom’s down the hall.

17:20.039 --> 17:24.248
I must have a spare toothbrush.
I bought a ten-pack once.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.369
There.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

17:41.644 --> 17:44.386
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.598
I’ve laid out one of my husband’s
pajamas for you.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.982
- Sleep well.
- Thanks.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.615
What’s the matter?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.792
Ali no sleep.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.041
Much thinking in head.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.625
Wants to talk with you. Okay?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.293
All right. Sit down here.

19:07.730 --> 19:12.394
Ali much alone, too.
Always working, drinking. Nothing else.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.476
Maybe German right.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.185
Arab not human.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.689
Nonsense.
You mustn’t even think that.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.283
You said yourself,
thinking makes a person sad.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.908
Though it’s not really true

19:25.998 --> 19:29.616
that thinking makes you sad.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.575
Of course not.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.457
What else should we do
with our time?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.960
All the years, all the months.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.417
And suddenly it’s over,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.925
and what is there to show for it?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.359
My God, I—

20:18.300 --> 20:19.915
Good morning.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.233
Your coffee always good.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.237
I’m actually quite a cook.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.359
You must come for dinner sometime.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.908
I’m sure you’d like it.
- Sure.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.409
- Maybe...
- Yes?

20:56.881 --> 20:58.496
Oh, nothing.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.082
It’s just that
an old woman like me...

21:01.177 --> 21:04.419
You not old woman.
You good. Big heart.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.887
Really?

21:08.559 --> 21:09.844
My God.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.051
Don’t cry.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.599
Please.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.688
Why cry?

21:16.776 --> 21:20.143
Because I’m so happy
and so full of fear, too.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.235
Not fear. Fear not good.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.779
Fear eat soul.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.069
Fear eats the soul?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.950
That’s nice.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.531
Is that an Arab saying?
- Yes.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.912
All Arabs speak so.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.959
It’s late. Must go now.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.629
Ifl come late, not good.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.959
When boss mad with Ali, real mean.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.256
I must go, too. I’ll get dressed,

21:47.348 --> 21:49.714
and we’ll go down together.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.726
I’m taking the subway. You too?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.649
No, I take tram.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.603
- Well, then. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

22:38.274 --> 22:42.984
Today a man chatted me up
in the subway. Me! An old woman!

22:43.070 --> 22:46.028
A foreign worker.
He wanted to buy me a coffee.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.606
- They stop at nothing.
- But...

22:48.701 --> 22:52.535
No, nothing’s sacred to them,
not even old age.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.449
They’re ﬁlthy pigs.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.201
The way they live!

22:56.292 --> 22:59.876
Whole families crammed into one room.
All they’re interested in is money.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.207
Maybe they can’t ﬁnd
a decent place.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.711
No. They’re stingy.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.463
Stingy, unwashed pigs.

23:08.554 --> 23:12.297
And they have only one thing
in their heads: women.

23:12.391 --> 23:16.509
But they do their work.
That’s what they’re here for.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.767
Hogwash. Go down
to the station and look around.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.435
A load of trash!

23:21.567 --> 23:23.398
None of them work.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.267
Exactly. They live here at our expense.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.397
You only have to read the papers,
full of rapes and so on.

23:29.742 --> 23:33.234
But some of them are married
to German women,

23:33.329 --> 23:35.194
aren’t they?

23:35.289 --> 23:38.998
Some women would stoop to anything.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.952
I’d die of shame.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.297
The mere thought!

23:48.052 --> 23:52.512
I’ve always said,
women like that are ﬁlthy whores.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.590
There’s one where | live.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.595
She must be 50 at least.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.301
She’s got one. A Turk, I think.

23:59.438 --> 24:03.431
He’s much younger than she is.
But no one talks with her anymore.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.140
Serves her right.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.231
Maybe he talks with her,

24:08.739 --> 24:10.445
and she doesn’t need anyone else.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.954
Nobody can live without others.
No one, Emmi.

24:19.959 --> 24:24.328
And what can you talk about
with someone like that?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.125
Most of them don’t speak
a word of German.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.794
All they want is sex.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.259
They’re not interested in talking.

24:32.346 --> 24:36.464
Some women want it that way.
Uncivilized.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.719
Sex on the brain.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.802
I’d die of shame
if I were like that.

24:41.647 --> 24:45.560
Well, we’d better get back to work.

25:22.104 --> 25:25.392
- Get me a beer.
- Get it yourself.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.603
If I have to get up,
you’re going to get it good.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.152
You wouldn’t have the energy.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.104
You’ll see.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.036
I have to go back
to work on Friday.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.836
- At last.
- It’s easy for you to laugh.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.884
I’m not laughing. I just want
my peace during the day.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.921
Because I don’t leave you alone?

26:01.435 --> 26:03.767
It depends how you look at it.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.511
Who’s that?

26:06.231 --> 26:09.018
How could I know in here
who’s ringing out there?

26:09.109 --> 26:10.849
Then you’d better go look.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.732
Lazy swine.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.997
- Mom!
- Christ Almighty!

26:27.586 --> 26:30.077
- Guess who’s here.
- I heard.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.250
Be nice to her, Eugen.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.956
Come in, Morn.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.917
Hello.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.465
Hi.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.598
Eugen’s on sick leave
till the day after tomorrow.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.968
- You’re sick?
- Sort of.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.897
- Shall I make you a coffee?
- Yes.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.644
That would be nice.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.695
- What’ve you got?
- A fever and a cough.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.118
Bull. He’s just lazy.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.158
The hell I am!

27:06.291 --> 27:08.156
I had a cough and fever,

27:08.961 --> 27:10.622
but I feel better now.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.672
Aren’t you working
for your manager today?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.086
No, that’s tomorrow.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.293
- And othenlvise?
- Not too bad.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.636
Oh, well. Your coffee.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.679
Want one, too?
- Leave me alone.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.970
Mind your manners
while Mom is here.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.015
I’ll do what I like in my own home.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.139
It’s my home, too.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.516
Shut your trap and put
some clothes on you, you slut!

27:33.652 --> 27:35.438
Just look at you.

27:35.529 --> 27:38.066
It’s like this every day, Morn.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.070
Are there any foreign workers
where you work?

27:44.037 --> 27:47.029
Don’t mention foreign workers.
It makes him see red.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.657
- Why?
- Because they’re swine.

27:49.793 --> 27:50.703
Oh, I see.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.167
Yes, they are!

27:53.172 --> 27:56.756
He’s even got a Turkish foreman.
He just can’t get over it.

27:56.842 --> 28:00.334
Can’t get over it?
I ignore the guy completely.

28:00.429 --> 28:03.546
- And when he gives you orders?
- He doesn’t give me orders.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.681
- Sure he does.
- Then...

28:06.768 --> 28:08.804
Get me the cigarettes.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.937
- I wouldn’t dream of it.
- Krista!

28:12.024 --> 28:13.355
Yes?

28:14.067 --> 28:16.149
Leave it, Mom. I’ll get up.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.851
I’ll get them myself.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.855
- I’ve fallen in love.
- What?

28:23.035 --> 28:24.650
Yes, Krista.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.360
I’m in love

28:26.788 --> 28:29.871
with a Moroccan
who’s 20 years younger than me,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.456
probably more.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.412
You’ve got a strange sense
of humor, Mom.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.164
It’s no joke.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.749
It’s true.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.426
I’m in love

28:43.555 --> 28:46.888
with a Moroccan
who’s younger than me.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.466
Much younger.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.723
I felt it was my duty to tell you.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.517
Don’t bother.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.398
I’ll see myself out.

29:00.781 --> 29:01.987
Bye.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.735
Bye, Mom.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.484
You know what?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.365
No, but I’m sure you’ll tell me.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.912
Your mother’s got a screw loose.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.809
A cola.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.686
Good evening.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.930
Strange,
it’s not even raining today.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.634
No, it’s not raining.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.637
It’s really quite nice.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.144
I’ll pay right away.
- One mark.

30:22.946 --> 30:26.814
- Here you are.
- By the way, this is my bar.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.614
Yes, okay.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.317
And?

32:03.004 --> 32:04.289
Good evening.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.090
Good evening.

32:15.225 --> 32:16.840
Yes?

32:19.855 --> 32:21.470
Yes.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.934
Well, then...

32:40.375 --> 32:43.242
- Like it?
- Tastes good.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.122
Dig in. There’s plenty.

32:45.255 --> 32:46.916
Thanks, not too much.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.294
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, coffee.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.390
- Ali bring money.
- No.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.472
Why no?

33:04.566 --> 33:06.477
Ali eat and drink.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.650
Always you pay. Not right.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.687
But I like to. I earn enough.

33:13.742 --> 33:17.485
And money spoils a friendship.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.953
Not spoil friendship.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.372
You take money.
Everything good.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.294
I’ll keep it for you in the drawer.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.122
When you need it, just take it.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.880
That money not for Ali. For Emmi.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.594
I don’t want it. It’s your money.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.093
I don’t want a penny from you.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.555
You make me so happy.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.601
Good evening, Mr. Gruber.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.860
Good evening, Mrs. Kurowski.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.607
Good evening.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.910
This is Mr. Gruber,
the landlord’s son.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.155
Please have a seat.
- Thanks.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.536
- Like a brandy?
- Yes, please.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.161
But I have something serious
to talk about with you.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.545
Well, then...

34:14.636 --> 34:18.800
I can only think

34:18.890 --> 34:21.222
you haven’t read your lease properly.

34:22.477 --> 34:25.560
Of course I’ve read it.

34:28.108 --> 34:31.600
Then you must know
you’re not allowed to sublet.

34:31.736 --> 34:34.352
Section ﬁve, clause two.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.406
You mean, because of Ali?

34:38.535 --> 34:42.904
Yes, Mrs. Kurowski. I—

34:42.998 --> 34:44.863
Cheers.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.742
That’s good.

34:49.796 --> 34:52.333
All I can say is

34:52.424 --> 34:56.588
your lodger must move out.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.627
By tomorrow, Mrs. Kurowski.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.965
But Ali’s not a lodger.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.593
We’re going to get married.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.349
Well...

35:09.274 --> 35:10.935
that’s different.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.068
I’ll be on my way, then.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.612
You’re old enough
to know what you’re doing.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.446
Good night.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.823
Good night.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.246
Good grief! What have I done?

35:27.334 --> 35:29.120
What he say?

35:29.210 --> 35:31.451
He said you can’t stay here.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.377
Not good man.

35:34.090 --> 35:37.298
He’s like everyone else.
No better, no worse.

35:38.553 --> 35:41.295
I told him we were going to marry.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.422
We marry?

35:43.516 --> 35:45.302
You and me? Okay.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.224
Good idea.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.813
But I didn’t mean it.
I just said it because —

35:51.900 --> 35:56.314
You and me marry,
very good.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.529
Now drink. Cheers.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.651
For everything good.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.245
Yes, Ali. Good for everything.

36:08.291 --> 36:12.876
Now we go tell Arab buddies.

36:16.633 --> 36:20.922
And they were so huge,
with big sleeves and trousers.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.504
And this little man came along
and just vanished in the suit.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.965
We laughed our heads off.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.014
Cheers.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.850
The ﬁlthy old whore.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.813
You’re just jealous.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.187
Jealous? Of her?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.198
Now I’ll play our song.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.010
Come on. Let’s dance.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.465
It’ll never work out.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.588
It’s unnatural,

37:48.683 --> 37:50.799
plain unnatural.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.596
That’s what I say.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.308
Of course it won’t work. So what?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.862
CIVIL REGISTRY ll, MUNICH

38:33.853 --> 38:35.514
You know what my name is now?

38:35.647 --> 38:38.434
- Long name.
- A very long name.

38:38.525 --> 38:43.110
Emanuela ben Salem M’Barek
Mohammed Mustapha.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.195
Sounds terriﬁc, doesn’t it?
- Very nice.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.986
Nice? I don’t know.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.949
Yes, nice.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.652
If you say so.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.404
Come on.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.388
Hello, Krista.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.389
This is Mom.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.357
I’d like to invite you over.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.522
Albert and Bruno, too.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.395
Next Saturday.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.988
Why?

39:29.075 --> 39:32.533
No special reason. I have something
I want to discuss with you.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.235
Call that taxi.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.598
This is where Hitler used to eat,

40:03.735 --> 40:07.398
from 1929 to ’33.

40:07.488 --> 40:09.399
I’ve always wanted to come here.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.902
Hitler, you know?
- Hitler, yes.

40:42.315 --> 40:46.433
Let’s just order the most expensive
things on the menu.

40:46.569 --> 40:50.278
The best soups, the best appetizers.
Or do you want something special?

40:50.406 --> 40:52.192
I eat what you eat.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.984
Good heavens! Look at that!

40:56.120 --> 40:58.577
Caviar costs 45 marks.

40:58.665 --> 41:01.577
Still, today’s a special day.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.875
Did you know
that there’s golden caviar, too?

41:03.962 --> 41:07.625
I read it in a magazine.

41:07.715 --> 41:11.333
- Golden caviar?
- Yes, like real gold.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.801
But it goes to the Shah of Persia.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.046
Ordinary people can’t get it.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.966
Caviar’s good for love, they say.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.718
Good for love?

41:21.813 --> 41:25.852
Yes, it puts you in the mood.
But I don’t believe that.

41:25.984 --> 41:30.023
Or only a bit.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.145
So, I’ll order now.

41:33.032 --> 41:33.817
Waiter.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.202
- Have you decided?
- Yes.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.041
We’ve decided.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.870
Two lobster cream soups,

41:50.091 --> 41:51.877
caviar for two

41:52.010 --> 41:54.001
and...

41:54.137 --> 41:58.346
Chateaubriand for two.

41:58.474 --> 42:00.931
How would you like
the Chateaubriand?

42:01.686 --> 42:05.099
How? Grilled, I thought.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.726
Of course, ma’am.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.770
Rare or medium?

42:12.405 --> 42:14.191
Rare, that sounds good.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.857
Rare, then.
Almost raw. Good.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.656
Raw?

42:21.873 --> 42:22.703
Actually...

42:25.043 --> 42:28.160
If it’s raw, we’d rather —

42:28.254 --> 42:29.869
What was the other one called?

42:30.757 --> 42:31.917
Medium.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.632
Right. That’s not raw?

42:34.719 --> 42:37.210
No, it’s medium.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.718
That’ll be ﬁne.

42:40.808 --> 42:43.140
An aperitif to start with?

42:43.227 --> 42:46.435
An — Oh, of course!

42:46.564 --> 42:48.179
What kind?

42:48.274 --> 42:49.889
Maybe...

42:50.860 --> 42:52.942
What would you recommend?

42:53.071 --> 42:55.904
You’d enjoy our house aperitif.

42:56.032 --> 42:58.489
Well, if you say so, ﬁne.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.241
He really had me on the rack there.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.080
If you’re not used
to things like that...

43:26.104 --> 43:29.141
Well, what’s up?
Why did you ask us over?

43:29.273 --> 43:32.481
You have to know sooner or later.

43:33.528 --> 43:35.109
Are you ill, Morn?

43:36.280 --> 43:38.271
Why ill?

43:38.407 --> 43:40.864
Because this is all so ofﬁcial.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.159
I’m anything but ill, Albert.

43:43.287 --> 43:44.823
I’ve gotten married.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.161
You’ve gotten —

43:50.920 --> 43:52.000
Mom!

43:52.130 --> 43:53.415
But —

43:54.090 --> 43:55.546
Who?

43:55.633 --> 43:57.294
Who did you marry?

43:57.385 --> 43:59.376
Come on in.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.555
This is my husband.

44:04.642 --> 44:08.305
El Hedi ben Salem M’Barek
Mohammed Mustapha.

44:08.563 --> 44:10.144
I call him A".

44:57.862 --> 44:58.851
Leave him.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.277
Bruno!

45:06.621 --> 45:08.703
You shouldn’t have done that,
Mother.

45:09.874 --> 45:11.535
Not that.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.833
It’s a disgrace.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.206
You can forget you have children.

45:17.340 --> 45:19.331
I want nothing to do with a whore.

45:25.473 --> 45:30.012
Come on, Eugen.
We’re not staying in this pigsty.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.638
- What would we like?
- A Libelle.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.382
Libelle.

46:14.397 --> 46:17.605
Not lemonade. Like butter.

46:20.403 --> 46:23.520
- Butter.
- No, not butter.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.320
Like butter. Libelle.

46:29.954 --> 46:33.196
No, mister, not that.
- Make up your mind.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.873
I don’t have all day. Well?

46:35.960 --> 46:39.202
Libelle, like butter. Not lemonade.

46:39.297 --> 46:42.960
Listen, you go and learn
some German ﬁrst. Then come back.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.792
- No understand.
- You understand me all right.

46:45.928 --> 46:50.137
Learn German ﬁrst,
then come back. Good-bye.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.464
Don’t understand.

46:51.642 --> 46:55.305
I say Libelle, like butter.
Not lemonade.

46:55.438 --> 46:57.053
Why you not understand? Why?

47:03.571 --> 47:05.277
What does he want?

47:05.990 --> 47:07.105
Libelle.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.691
Sure, that’s the new margarine.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.239
You think I don’t know that?

47:18.085 --> 47:20.667
He not give Libelle.
Say he don’t understand.

47:20.755 --> 47:24.498
It’s written clearly
on the list, “Libelle.”

47:24.633 --> 47:28.922
I say, “Libelle, like butter.”
He give lemonade.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.675
He just doesn’t want to serve you.

47:31.807 --> 47:34.219
I’ll show him.
- What you do?

47:35.519 --> 47:37.134
I’ll go over and have
a word with him.

47:37.229 --> 47:40.266
I’ve been a customer
of that swine for 20 years.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.189
No ﬁght. Fighting not good.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.562
Iwon’t ﬁght. Don’t worry.

47:50.868 --> 47:51.857
Hello.

47:55.081 --> 47:57.538
Hello, Mrs. Kurowski.
What’ll it be?

47:57.958 --> 48:00.870
Tell me, Mr. Angermeyer,
why won’t you serve my husband?

48:01.003 --> 48:02.618
What’s he done to you?

48:02.713 --> 48:05.921
Not serve your husband?
He can’t tell me what he wants.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.587
He asked for Libelle. Margarine.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.049
You see, I didn’t understand.

48:12.139 --> 48:15.882
You understood him, all right.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.885
But you didn’t want to understand.
And you know why?

48:19.021 --> 48:22.058
Because he’s a foreigner.
That’s why you didn’t understand.

48:22.191 --> 48:26.104
I won’t let you accuse me
of prejudice against foreigners.

48:26.237 --> 48:29.400
I have nothing against foreigners,
not even yours.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.572
Serve him, then, when he comes in!

48:31.700 --> 48:34.237
I can’t serve someone
who can’t speak German.

48:34.370 --> 48:36.452
Nonsense!

48:37.331 --> 48:38.787
He can speak German
better than you.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.202
I’m not letting you tell me

48:41.293 --> 48:45.377
a black can speak better German
than me. Not you!

48:45.464 --> 48:47.796
And that’s the last time
I serve you, too.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.041
I don’t need trouble in my shop.

48:50.136 --> 48:53.299
Leave the shop at once
or I’ll throw you out! You!

48:53.431 --> 48:55.467
- Yes?
- Out!

49:28.674 --> 49:30.289
Mrs. Kurowski.

49:30.426 --> 49:33.338
We’ve been meaning
to have a word with you.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.962
About cleaning the staircase.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.967
In all seriousness.

49:38.058 --> 49:42.392
We’ve spoken to everyone
in the house, and they all agree.

49:43.772 --> 49:45.387
About what?

49:45.483 --> 49:48.975
About the dirt in the house lately.

49:49.111 --> 49:51.102
Dirt? I don’t see any.

49:51.197 --> 49:53.609
But everyone says there is.

49:53.699 --> 49:57.988
And we’ve all agreed
you’ll have to clean twice a month.

49:58.078 --> 50:01.491
Me? Why?
We’ve had our system for years.

50:01.624 --> 50:05.162
Yes, but the situation
has changed radically.

50:05.252 --> 50:06.367
Radically.

50:06.504 --> 50:08.961
It’s the same everywhere.

50:09.048 --> 50:12.085
With people like that
in the house, dirt takes over.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.000
You know what I say?

50:15.137 --> 50:18.550
You put your own house in order,
and I’ll see to mine.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.431
I don’t meddle in your affairs.

50:21.519 --> 50:25.182
We have nothing
to reproach ourselves with.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.482
If you ask me,
you’re jealous, Mrs. Karges.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.479
You’re just jealous.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.026
Good day.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.441
The nerve!

50:35.533 --> 50:37.319
Me? Jealous?

50:38.369 --> 50:40.280
What does she mean by that?

50:49.004 --> 50:50.835
Hello.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.879
Here.
- Thanks.

51:00.182 --> 51:02.548
That’s 236 marks, 50.

51:02.685 --> 51:05.472
Five hours overtime.
One every day.

51:05.896 --> 51:09.855
And I thought you were
boozing it up somewhere.

51:09.942 --> 51:11.728
No understand “boozing.”

51:12.027 --> 51:14.484
Drinking. Beer or liquor.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.608
Ali not drink without you.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.401
That’s all right.

51:18.534 --> 51:20.946
I earned 210 marks this week,

51:21.078 --> 51:23.615
and you 236.50.

51:23.747 --> 51:28.036
That makes 446 marks, 50 in all.

51:28.127 --> 51:29.992
We’ll be rich, Ali.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.162
And we’ll buy ourselves
a little piece of heaven.

51:33.257 --> 51:34.963
Why heaven?

51:35.759 --> 51:38.000
Oh, just a fancy of mine.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.051
I take a shower.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.596
- Want a coffee?
- Coffee? Yes.

52:04.455 --> 52:07.037
You’re very beautiful, AIi.

52:10.586 --> 52:12.201
Coffee’s ready.

52:22.723 --> 52:24.509
- Here.
- Thanks.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.812
Paula. What brings you here?

52:32.900 --> 52:35.266
My sister died today.

52:35.361 --> 52:37.727
She’d been sick a long time.

52:37.821 --> 52:40.062
The funeral’s on Monday morning.

52:40.157 --> 52:43.069
I wanted to ask
if you’d ﬁll in for me.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.821
Come in, please.

52:45.996 --> 52:48.487
This is Mrs. Borchert.
She works with me.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.660
Ali, my husband.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.200
Your —

52:53.337 --> 52:56.921
Yes, Paula. We’ve been married
for three months.

52:58.634 --> 53:00.295
My God.

53:02.221 --> 53:03.836
Hello.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.883
Well, I’d better be going.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.507
- Have a coffee with us.
- No, thanks.

53:08.644 --> 53:11.761
I’ll ask Hedwig about Monday.
Who’d have dreamed that?

53:11.855 --> 53:13.345
But Paula —

53:13.607 --> 53:14.767
That woman no good.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.689
Nonsense. She’s okay.

53:16.777 --> 53:18.483
She was just surprised.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.521
That woman has death in her eye.

53:21.657 --> 53:24.194
No wonder. Her sister just died.

53:24.284 --> 53:26.900
No. Other death in her eye.

53:27.037 --> 53:30.120
You’re imagining things.

53:30.207 --> 53:32.243
Come on, get dressed.

53:32.376 --> 53:35.584
Let’s go see buddies.
Germans not good.

53:35.713 --> 53:38.625
I don’t feel like going out today.

53:45.556 --> 53:50.391
Why don’t you bring
your friends here for a drink?

53:50.477 --> 53:52.092
It’s much nicer here, isn’t it?

53:52.229 --> 53:54.436
Buddies come here?

53:54.565 --> 53:57.398
Yes. Get dressed
and bring them here.

54:13.459 --> 54:15.245
- Hi.
- Hello.

54:15.836 --> 54:19.749
Nobody’s here yet.
Probably doing overtime.

54:19.882 --> 54:21.873
A beer?
- Small beer.

54:31.894 --> 54:33.805
How are you?

54:36.774 --> 54:38.605
Good.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.600
Happy?

54:42.237 --> 54:43.943
Don’t know.

54:47.284 --> 54:51.118
- Come by my place again sometime.
- Maybe.

54:51.246 --> 54:53.828
- I’ll make you some couscous.
- Your couscous good.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.165
- Well, then?
- Don’t know.

54:57.294 --> 54:58.955
Or are you scared of your wife?

54:59.046 --> 55:00.957
Ali not scared.

55:01.548 --> 55:04.460
- Well, come by then.
- Maybe.

55:12.351 --> 55:14.216
- Hello.
- Hi, All.

55:15.604 --> 55:18.516
- Come to my home? Little party.
- Okay.

55:18.649 --> 55:20.935
I’m not going to that
old whore’s place!

55:22.402 --> 55:24.017
She not old whore!

55:24.321 --> 55:26.778
All right. Let me go.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.480
Come on.

55:34.665 --> 55:37.156
Come to my place? Little party.

55:44.675 --> 55:46.336
Bastards.

55:51.014 --> 55:53.221
It’s on the next ﬁoor up.

55:53.350 --> 55:55.386
Can’t get a wink of sleep.

55:55.519 --> 55:58.977
She’s got four foreigners
in her apartment. Four of them!

55:59.064 --> 56:01.020
You’re not safe anymore.

56:01.275 --> 56:02.981
Now, now. Let’s not exaggerate.

56:03.068 --> 56:05.480
She’s not, Ofﬁcer.
They’re all Arabs.

56:05.571 --> 56:08.529
You know what they’re like,
bombs and all that.

56:08.657 --> 56:12.445
They’re not all like that, ma’am.
Come on, Hans. We’ll have a look.

56:17.875 --> 56:21.538
Did you see that?
Policemen with long hair.

56:21.670 --> 56:24.958
Things sure have changed.

56:26.258 --> 56:27.543
Five.

56:27.634 --> 56:30.091
One, two, three, four, ﬁve.

56:34.558 --> 56:37.015
Nothing. Again nothing.

56:37.936 --> 56:39.722
At last.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.105
It’s your turn.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.193
Cheers.

56:54.244 --> 56:55.950
Good evening.

56:56.079 --> 56:59.162
Sorry, but your neighbors say
the music’s causing a disturbance.

56:59.249 --> 57:01.160
If you would turn it down, please.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.248
But —

57:02.336 --> 57:05.078
Sorry, but if it disturbs them...

57:05.213 --> 57:07.249
Okay, I’ll turn it down.

57:07.341 --> 57:08.751
Good night.

57:16.183 --> 57:17.639
Six.

57:18.769 --> 57:21.260
Turn the music down a little.

57:21.396 --> 57:22.602
Why?

57:22.773 --> 57:25.059
They’ve set the police on us.

57:47.005 --> 57:48.961
Could you hand me a knife?

57:50.175 --> 57:54.134
The subway rates are going up.
It was in the paper today.

57:54.221 --> 57:56.212
Not again.

57:56.306 --> 57:58.262
I read it, too.

57:59.017 --> 58:00.803
Want a piece?

58:04.731 --> 58:07.393
Stop acting so strange.
Hand me a knife, will you?

58:08.819 --> 58:11.185
And it said

58:11.321 --> 58:15.485
women should have
a cancer test every six months.

58:15.575 --> 58:18.191
- Every six months?
- Yes, every woman.

58:18.328 --> 58:22.367
Not that it does much good.
My sister-in-law, for instance —

58:22.499 --> 58:24.660
Let’s sit over there.

58:30.841 --> 58:35.255
Anyway, I’m making
an appointment for next week.

58:35.345 --> 58:38.508
Make one for us, too.
You’ll come, won’t you, Frieda?

58:38.598 --> 58:41.431
Yes, if you’re going.
I’d be scared alone.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.172
Hello.

59:18.263 --> 59:19.878
Hello, Mrs. Kurowski.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.969
That rabble.

59:24.269 --> 59:27.102
Can’t we do anything about it,
Mr. Gruber?

59:27.230 --> 59:28.595
Why?

59:28.899 --> 59:31.060
They seem very happy together.

59:31.151 --> 59:33.392
What’s happiness?

59:33.487 --> 59:35.728
There’s still such
a thing as decency.

59:36.615 --> 59:42.076
I fail to see anything indecent,
hard as I might try. Good-bye.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.994
- Can you understand it?
- No.

1:00:09.731 --> 1:00:11.346
Everyone’s looking.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:16.943
Don’t let it bother you.
They’re just envious.

1:00:20.367 --> 1:00:22.653
No understand “envious.”

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:24.401
Envious is

1:00:24.496 --> 1:00:28.034
when someone doesn’t like
another person having something.

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:29.615
Understand.

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:32.959
They’re just envious.

1:00:33.088 --> 1:00:34.703
All of them.

1:00:43.765 --> 1:00:45.380
Why do you cry?

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:51.811
Because I’m so happy
on the one hand,

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:54.898
and on the other,
I can’t bear it anymore.

1:00:55.944 --> 1:00:59.152
All this hatred

1:00:59.281 --> 1:01:01.738
from everyone.

1:01:04.494 --> 1:01:08.157
Sometimes I wish I were
all alone with you in the world

1:01:08.248 --> 1:01:10.284
with nobody around us.

1:01:12.252 --> 1:01:16.495
I always pretend I don’t care,

1:01:18.550 --> 1:01:21.007
but I do care.

1:01:22.721 --> 1:01:24.677
It’s killing me.

1:01:28.852 --> 1:01:31.685
Nobody looks me in the eye anymore.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:35.647
They all have such a horrible grin.

1:01:37.986 --> 1:01:39.851
They’re all swine!

1:01:40.739 --> 1:01:43.196
Dirty swine, all of them!

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:48.573
Stop staring, you stupid swine!

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:50.161
This is my husband.

1:01:50.415 --> 1:01:51.871
My husband.

1:02:18.652 --> 1:02:21.268
I love you, too.

1:02:22.155 --> 1:02:25.113
- Me more.
- How much?

1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:27.486
So much.

1:02:28.536 --> 1:02:30.777
And me, from here

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:32.575
to Morocco.

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:36.245
You know what?
Let’s go away somewhere.

1:02:36.336 --> 1:02:38.827
Somewhere where
we’ll be on our own,

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:42.255
where no one knows us
and no one stares.

1:02:43.510 --> 1:02:47.002
When we get back,
it’ll all be different.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:52.098
Everyone will be nice to us.

1:02:52.227 --> 1:02:53.842
They will.

1:03:28.888 --> 1:03:31.300
They’re back again.

1:03:31.391 --> 1:03:33.006
Who?

1:03:34.311 --> 1:03:37.053
Mrs. Kurowski and her foreigner.

1:03:38.106 --> 1:03:39.721
You know,

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:42.432
I always thought she was nice.

1:03:42.527 --> 1:03:44.984
She is. But that foreigner...

1:03:46.114 --> 1:03:48.446
Things like that don’t last.

1:03:48.533 --> 1:03:50.194
You reckon?

1:03:50.493 --> 1:03:51.482
Of course.

1:03:51.578 --> 1:03:54.240
Listen. Next time she walks by,

1:03:54.331 --> 1:03:57.664
go out and say hello.

1:03:57.751 --> 1:04:00.163
To her? No!

1:04:00.295 --> 1:04:02.160
Anton.

1:04:02.297 --> 1:04:05.084
Don’t forget
she was a good customer.

1:04:06.384 --> 1:04:08.215
You’re right there.

1:04:09.387 --> 1:04:13.005
Just walk out, say hello,

1:04:13.099 --> 1:04:15.055
and things will be back to normal.

1:04:15.518 --> 1:04:18.180
And she’ll do her shopping
here again.

1:04:19.356 --> 1:04:23.975
Yes, they’re all going to
the supermarket instead of coming here.

1:04:25.111 --> 1:04:27.272
You’re right, Adele.

1:04:27.364 --> 1:04:31.357
In business
you have to hide your aversions.

1:04:46.091 --> 1:04:48.503
Mrs. Kurowski. Just the person...

1:04:48.593 --> 1:04:50.879
- Hello, Mrs. Ellis.
- Hello.

1:04:51.221 --> 1:04:57.057
Imagine! They’ve sent my son
to Norway for a whole year.

1:04:57.143 --> 1:04:59.054
I’ll be right up.

1:05:00.105 --> 1:05:05.316
So he asked me to keep
his things here for him.

1:05:08.738 --> 1:05:10.979
But I’ve got such a small cellar,

1:05:11.074 --> 1:05:14.487
and I thought, since I have
all that stuff down there,

1:05:14.577 --> 1:05:16.238
maybe you...

1:05:16.329 --> 1:05:18.411
Of course, Mrs. Ellis.

1:05:18.498 --> 1:05:22.332
I don’t need all that space.
When would you need it?

1:05:22.419 --> 1:05:25.252
Today, if possible.

1:05:25.338 --> 1:05:29.172
His stuff’s been down there
for 10 days now.

1:05:29.259 --> 1:05:31.341
It would be very nice if...

1:05:31.428 --> 1:05:34.920
Okay. I’ll tell my husband
to give you a hand.

1:05:35.014 --> 1:05:37.130
I’m sure it’s not so light.

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:39.974
It’s good to have
a strong man in the house.

1:05:40.103 --> 1:05:43.186
He’ll be down in 10 minutes. Bye.

1:05:44.232 --> 1:05:47.269
Bye, Mrs. Kurowski.
And thanks a million.

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:50.067
Don’t mention it.

1:05:50.155 --> 1:05:52.271
Such a nice woman.
And so helpful.

1:05:52.365 --> 1:05:54.276
Yes, she always was.

1:06:00.957 --> 1:06:04.870
Here are the cellar keys.
Help the woman move her stuff.

1:06:04.961 --> 1:06:08.078
Be nice to her
and she’ll be nice to us.

1:06:08.173 --> 1:06:11.290
I’m going shopping.
Do you understand?

1:06:11.384 --> 1:06:13.796
- Understand.
- And put something else on.

1:06:19.893 --> 1:06:22.475
Anton, here she comes.
Out you go.

1:06:31.571 --> 1:06:35.814
Hello, Mrs. Kurowski.
Back from your vacation?

1:06:35.950 --> 1:06:38.532
Was the weather nice?
- Very nice.

1:06:38.661 --> 1:06:41.573
It’s high time we took a vacation.
Where did you go?

1:06:41.664 --> 1:06:43.495
Not far. To Steinsee.

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:47.326
I know it. Nice place.

1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:50.332
Come in and tell us all about it.

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:03.182
Hello, Mr. Kurowski.

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:07.262
Your mother’s back.
She’s just gone shopping.

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:09.348
She’ll be back in a minute.

1:07:09.484 --> 1:07:11.850
Thanks, Mrs. Karges. I’ll wait.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:17.196
Her husband’s down in the cellar

1:07:17.325 --> 1:07:19.941
helping Mrs. Ellis rearrange things.

1:07:20.036 --> 1:07:25.372
Her son’s suddenly been
transferred to Non/vay.

1:07:25.458 --> 1:07:29.497
And your mother
has the biggest cellar here.

1:07:29.587 --> 1:07:32.670
Mrs. Kurowski.

1:07:32.757 --> 1:07:35.590
Your son Bruno’s here.

1:08:02.579 --> 1:08:05.446
- You got the check?
- Yes, just now.

1:08:06.541 --> 1:08:10.033
The letter was in the mailbox
when I got back, with the check.

1:08:10.128 --> 1:08:12.494
It’s for the TV set.

1:08:12.589 --> 1:08:14.454
I’m sorry,

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:17.628
but I was so surprised
I just lost my head.

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:20.297
I wouldn’t have reacted
like that othenNise.

1:08:20.430 --> 1:08:24.469
You always were a hothead.
Remember the cat?

1:08:24.601 --> 1:08:27.593
My God, Mom, you can’t hold that
against me all my life.

1:08:27.729 --> 1:08:29.435
No.

1:08:30.315 --> 1:08:32.226
I had really forgotten all about it.

1:08:32.317 --> 1:08:35.935
Everything will be okay now.
I’ve spoken to Krista.

1:08:36.029 --> 1:08:39.692
Albert still hasn’t gotten over it,
but he’ll come around.

1:08:39.782 --> 1:08:43.274
Sure. Time heals all wounds.

1:08:44.621 --> 1:08:48.034
Actually,
I wanted to ask you a favor.

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:50.536
Out with it.

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:53.369
No need to beat around
the bush with your old mom.

1:08:54.088 --> 1:08:56.124
No, you’re right.

1:08:57.008 --> 1:08:59.374
- Brandy?
- No, thanks.

1:08:59.469 --> 1:09:03.462
Hildegard wants to take
a part-time job again.

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:07.056
What with everything
being so expensive...

1:09:07.143 --> 1:09:10.977
We’ve hunted high and low
for a kindergarten, but it’s hopeless.

1:09:11.105 --> 1:09:13.016
They’re all booked up.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:17.563
So I thought maybe you could
take Beate from 1:00 to 5:00.

1:09:17.654 --> 1:09:19.815
I’d pick her up aften/vards.

1:09:19.947 --> 1:09:21.903
It would be a great help.

1:09:24.369 --> 1:09:25.984
Hello.

1:09:27.455 --> 1:09:28.820
Hello.

1:09:29.999 --> 1:09:31.955
I’m going to shower.

1:09:35.505 --> 1:09:37.496
Do you think you could manage it?

1:09:37.590 --> 1:09:40.206
Hildegard starts work
at Pschorr on the ﬁrst.

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:42.675
Of course.
I’ve always been there for you.

1:09:42.762 --> 1:09:45.003
Thanks a lot, Mom.

1:09:45.139 --> 1:09:49.348
Then I’ll be going.
They’re waiting for me.

1:09:49.477 --> 1:09:52.184
I might come by on Sunday,
with Hildegard.

1:09:52.271 --> 1:09:53.932
Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

1:09:56.150 --> 1:09:58.232
Finished in the cellar?

1:09:58.361 --> 1:09:59.976
Finished.

1:10:00.488 --> 1:10:03.150
You no make couscous?

1:10:03.241 --> 1:10:06.324
I can’t make couscous,
you know that.

1:10:06.411 --> 1:10:09.995
You should get used to the way
things are done in Germany.

1:10:10.081 --> 1:10:12.367
People in Germany
don’t eat couscous.

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:15.207
Couscous good sometimes.

1:10:22.093 --> 1:10:23.708
I don’t like couscous.

1:10:26.514 --> 1:10:28.379
Where are you off to?

1:10:28.516 --> 1:10:31.883
Ali go to Arab buddies.
Maybe eat couscous.

1:10:32.019 --> 1:10:33.759
You’re not taking me with you?

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:37.143
No. Want to be alone.

1:11:28.701 --> 1:11:31.693
CLOSED TODAY

1:12:30.888 --> 1:12:33.880
Hello. Back in town?

1:12:34.016 --> 1:12:35.426
Come in.

1:12:43.776 --> 1:12:46.188
Have a nice vacation?
- Very nice.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:54.692
- Like something to drink or to eat?
- Couscous.

1:12:56.122 --> 1:12:57.862
Okay.

1:12:57.957 --> 1:13:00.073
I’ll put the pan on.

1:13:00.751 --> 1:13:03.413
There’s some ﬁg brandy
in the cupboard.

1:13:03.546 --> 1:13:05.161
Help yourself to a glass.

1:16:11.192 --> 1:16:13.057
This is Yolanda.

1:16:13.194 --> 1:16:16.061
- She’s from Yugoslavia.
- Herzegovina.

1:16:16.197 --> 1:16:18.483
Interesting. Where’s Frieda?

1:16:18.574 --> 1:16:23.284
Haven’t you heard?
She got ﬁred without notice.

1:16:23.412 --> 1:16:25.073
Fired without notice?

1:16:25.206 --> 1:16:26.992
For stealing.

1:16:28.375 --> 1:16:29.990
No.

1:16:30.086 --> 1:16:33.374
It’s true.
They say she’s been at it for ages.

1:16:33.464 --> 1:16:36.251
They caught her
with an adding machine.

1:16:36.383 --> 1:16:39.466
The next day,
she didn’t show up,

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:41.301
and Yolanda came.

1:16:41.430 --> 1:16:42.545
Well, I never!

1:16:42.765 --> 1:16:45.302
Who would have thought it of Frieda?

1:16:45.434 --> 1:16:51.270
Of course, she never did
look you straight in the eye.

1:16:51.357 --> 1:16:54.144
- Really?
- You must remember. Always shifty.

1:16:54.276 --> 1:16:56.062
You’re probably right.

1:16:56.153 --> 1:16:57.984
And then...

1:16:59.198 --> 1:17:01.029
Let’s go over there.

1:17:05.704 --> 1:17:08.036
There was the matter of our raise.

1:17:08.124 --> 1:17:10.957
That’s right.
Twenty pfennigs. Well?

1:17:11.043 --> 1:17:13.284
You can forget it.

1:17:13.420 --> 1:17:15.331
They’ve probably forgotten us.

1:17:15.464 --> 1:17:17.079
Forgotten? I can’t imagine that.

1:17:17.174 --> 1:17:20.587
There’s no other explanation.

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.343
Come here. Listen.

1:17:32.273 --> 1:17:34.810
Yolanda gets 3.40 an hour,

1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:37.061
50 pfennigs less than us.

1:17:37.153 --> 1:17:39.064
- No.
- Yes.

1:17:39.155 --> 1:17:40.986
They know all the tricks up there.

1:17:41.073 --> 1:17:44.531
We must think of something
to get that raise.

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:48.278
Come to my place
and we’ll talk it over, okay?

1:17:48.372 --> 1:17:50.454
- How about it?
- We’ll see.

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:52.994
What about her?

1:17:58.507 --> 1:18:02.341
There’s no point.
She’s on a different pay scale.

1:18:02.428 --> 1:18:04.510
6:00, then?
- Okay.

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:26.486
This is Ali.

1:18:26.577 --> 1:18:28.408
Say hello.

1:18:29.997 --> 1:18:31.783
Hello.

1:18:34.043 --> 1:18:36.785
He’s a handsome one, Emmi,

1:18:36.879 --> 1:18:38.540
and so clean.

1:18:38.631 --> 1:18:40.087
What do you mean?

1:18:40.216 --> 1:18:45.461
Sorry, but I always thought
they didn’t wash.

1:18:45.554 --> 1:18:48.170
He does.

1:18:48.265 --> 1:18:50.426
He even takes a shower every day.

1:18:51.393 --> 1:18:53.634
And just look at those muscles!

1:18:56.065 --> 1:18:58.431
He’s really strong.

1:18:59.485 --> 1:19:01.146
Come here.

1:19:04.573 --> 1:19:07.030
Go ahead. Feel his muscles.

1:19:09.954 --> 1:19:11.569
Terriﬁc!

1:19:12.623 --> 1:19:14.955
And such nice soft skin.

1:19:15.084 --> 1:19:19.623
He’s so young.
But he’s a good man, really.

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.370
What’s eating him?

1:19:21.465 --> 1:19:25.333
He has his moods.
It’s his foreign mentality.

1:19:25.427 --> 1:19:28.043
Would you like something to drink?
- Yes. Coffee, please.

1:19:28.138 --> 1:19:30.379
You too, Paula?
- Yes, but not too strong.

1:19:30.474 --> 1:19:32.214
I’ll be right back.

1:20:01.964 --> 1:20:05.877
Oh, it’s you.
Come in. But I’m on my way out.

1:20:05.968 --> 1:20:08.459
There’s still some couscous
in the kitchen.

1:20:08.595 --> 1:20:12.179
You can warm it up and watch TV.

1:20:12.308 --> 1:20:13.923
Or do you want to come along?

1:20:14.018 --> 1:20:15.883
No. I stay here.

1:20:15.978 --> 1:20:18.435
Will you be here when I get back?

1:20:21.150 --> 1:20:22.936
See you later.

1:20:43.589 --> 1:20:45.625
Oh, I’m sorry. I thought...

1:20:45.966 --> 1:20:48.252
That’s all right, Mrs. Kurowski.

1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:58.175
Good night.

1:21:34.515 --> 1:21:36.551
- Are you going?
- Don’t know.

1:21:36.683 --> 1:21:39.800
Stay here.
I hate sleeping alone.

1:21:42.064 --> 1:21:44.976
I’ll just go wash quickly.

1:21:48.278 --> 1:21:51.145
Working nights
really takes it out of me.

1:22:57.890 --> 1:22:59.972
There’s this guy at the movies.

1:23:00.058 --> 1:23:01.969
Suddenly there’s an awful stench.

1:23:02.686 --> 1:23:04.722
He asks the guy in front of him,

1:23:04.813 --> 1:23:06.974
“Did you shit your pants?”

1:23:07.065 --> 1:23:09.681
And the guy answers,
“Yes. Why?”

1:23:10.944 --> 1:23:13.686
A mouse and an elephant meet.

1:23:13.822 --> 1:23:16.689
The mouse says to the elephant,
“My, aren’t you big!”

1:23:16.825 --> 1:23:18.656
And the elephant says to the mouse,

1:23:18.744 --> 1:23:20.359
“My, aren’t you small!”

1:23:20.496 --> 1:23:23.579
And the mouse replies,
“Well, I’ve been ill for six weeks.”

1:23:32.257 --> 1:23:34.498
- There he is.
- Yes, thanks.

1:23:38.055 --> 1:23:41.297
Where were you all night?
I’ve been worried sick.

1:23:47.940 --> 1:23:50.477
You shouldn’t do this to me, Ali.

1:23:53.695 --> 1:23:56.528
You don’t have to say anything.
Just come back.

1:23:58.116 --> 1:23:59.731
I need you, Ali.

1:24:00.786 --> 1:24:02.697
I need you so much.

1:24:12.256 --> 1:24:13.917
Who’s that, Ali?

1:24:14.383 --> 1:24:17.546
Your grandma from Morocco?
What does she want?

1:25:03.765 --> 1:25:06.097
His grandma from Morocco!

1:25:23.702 --> 1:25:23.736
Ten marks.

1:25:23.744 --> 1:25:25.655
Ten marks.

1:25:30.542 --> 1:25:32.453
Another 10.

1:25:39.468 --> 1:25:41.129
Fifteen.

1:25:46.975 --> 1:25:48.806
Twenty.

1:26:00.364 --> 1:26:04.824
Go to my place and get
100 marks for me. Hurry.

1:26:07.037 --> 1:26:10.029
He get money,
then I play more.

1:26:13.919 --> 1:26:14.999
Three whiskies.

1:26:15.087 --> 1:26:18.375
Don’t let them ﬂeece you!
You’re gambling away a week’s wages.

1:26:18.507 --> 1:26:21.920
Who care? K/ﬁk/ﬂ
Understand?

1:27:22.154 --> 1:27:23.735
One.

1:27:24.448 --> 1:27:26.063
Two.

1:27:28.326 --> 1:27:29.782
Ten.

1:27:32.748 --> 1:27:33.954
Fifteen.

1:27:37.586 --> 1:27:39.201
Twenty.

1:27:42.841 --> 1:27:44.297
Twenty-ﬁve.

1:27:44.426 --> 1:27:46.132
A cola, miss.

1:27:52.934 --> 1:27:54.549
Shit!

1:27:58.273 --> 1:28:00.138
Thanks, and...

1:28:00.692 --> 1:28:01.647
Yes?

1:28:01.777 --> 1:28:04.985
Would you play
the gypsy record for me, please?

1:28:05.113 --> 1:28:08.731
- “The Black Gypsy”?
- Yes, that’s it. Thanks.

1:29:00.710 --> 1:29:02.666
You dance with me?

1:29:25.694 --> 1:29:28.231
Me sleep with other woman.

1:29:28.363 --> 1:29:30.604
That’s not important, AIi.

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:34.236
Not important at all.

1:29:34.369 --> 1:29:38.157
I don’t want to,
but always so nervous.

1:29:40.041 --> 1:29:42.248
You’re a free man.

1:29:43.503 --> 1:29:46.245
You can do what you like.

1:29:48.133 --> 1:29:50.169
I know how old I am.

1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:52.876
I see it in the mirror every day.

1:29:52.971 --> 1:29:56.555
I can’t keep you from doing things.

1:29:56.683 --> 1:30:00.141
But when we’re together,
we must be nice to each other.

1:30:00.228 --> 1:30:03.891
Othen/vise, life’s not worth living.

1:30:05.567 --> 1:30:07.307
I don’t want other woman.

1:30:07.402 --> 1:30:09.358
I love only you.

1:30:09.738 --> 1:30:11.444
I love you, too.

1:30:11.573 --> 1:30:13.814
Together we’re strong.

1:30:27.047 --> 1:30:30.790
Call an ambulance! Quick!

1:30:37.349 --> 1:30:40.512
Send an ambulance
to the Asphalt Bar,

1:30:40.602 --> 1:30:42.467
17 Cornelius Strasse.

1:30:42.604 --> 1:30:44.811
Someone has collapsed.
He’s groaning terribly.

1:30:45.857 --> 1:30:47.518
Thanks.

1:31:17.055 --> 1:31:19.091
He has a perforated stomach ulcer.

1:31:20.225 --> 1:31:23.433
It happens a lot
with foreign workers.

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:25.476
It’s the stress.

1:31:26.481 --> 1:31:28.563
And there’s not much we can do.

1:31:29.526 --> 1:31:33.565
We’re not allowed to send them
to convalesce. We can only operate.

1:31:34.489 --> 1:31:38.402
And six months later
they have another ulcer.

1:31:38.493 --> 1:31:41.451
- And him?
- Oh, he’ll recover.

1:31:42.330 --> 1:31:44.662
But he’ll be back here
again in six months.

1:31:44.749 --> 1:31:48.913
No, he won’t.
I’ll do everything in my power —

1:31:49.170 --> 1:31:52.333
Well, the best of luck anyway.

1:31:53.675 --> 1:31:55.666
And don’t stay too long.

1:31:55.802 --> 1:31:57.167
Good-bye.
