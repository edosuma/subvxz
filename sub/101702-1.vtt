WEBVTT

00:33.366 --> 00:34.869
<i>Hey, Lion.</i>

00:38.005 --> 00:39.472
<i>Hey, Lion.</i>

00:46.180 --> 00:48.448
Brother, you up?

00:48.582 --> 00:50.483
Yeah,
what's wrong?

00:55.223 --> 00:57.124
We're gonna be good,
Lion.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.826
Yeah, I know, man.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.462
I mean,
I can see it.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.665
I can see our future
when I close my eyes.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.804
We got it all laid out
in front of us.

01:11.205 --> 01:14.075
I can see our house.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.144
We each got a walk-in closet
for all our silk shirts

01:17.278 --> 01:20.480
and handmade
Italian suits.

01:24.018 --> 01:25.719
- You know where it is?
- In California.

01:25.853 --> 01:30.258
Stan, if I don't go to sleep,
I'm not gonna win tomorrow.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.826
We're not gonna lose.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.562
It's fate.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.767
<i>With a new day
comes new opportunities.</i>

01:40.902 --> 01:43.503
<i>A chance to change everything.</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:45.139
<i>What we can or cannot do</i>

01:45.273 --> 01:48.976
<i>comes down to what
we believe is possible.</i>

01:49.110 --> 01:53.114
<i>What will you choose,
fear or hope?</i>

01:53.247 --> 01:56.416
<i>I challenge you to make
your life extraordinary.</i>

01:56.549 --> 01:59.854
<i>What does it take
to live an extraordinary life?</i>

01:59.987 --> 02:01.055
<i>Having focus.</i>

02:18.973 --> 02:21.909
Up and at 'em.
Time to eat.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.013
Lion.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.747
Yo, Lion.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.756
Come on, Ash.
Eat this shit.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.869
Your wrist
bothering you?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.704
Just aches.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.979
It's fight day,
baby.

02:59.814 --> 03:02.049
I'll get you some ice
and a hot towel.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.019
None of that mixie goes to Ash.
All right?

03:08.122 --> 03:10.891
Come here.

03:13.995 --> 03:15.262
Good boy.

03:23.004 --> 03:24.171
All right.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.343
Oh, fuck!

03:31.178 --> 03:32.746
All right,
come on.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.616
Put your hand on the
frame, all right?

03:43.523 --> 03:45.026
Right.
Let's do it.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.695
Let's loosen up.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.892
One, two.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.427
One, two.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.895
One, two.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.038
What's going on,
Barbara?

06:11.172 --> 06:12.406
Looking good.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.276
Something wonderful's
happening tonight, ladies.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.844
I can feel it!

06:18.812 --> 06:20.881
Beast from the northeast
right there.

06:21.015 --> 06:24.418
Lion Kaminsky in the
fight of the century.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.086
That right, bro?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.222
Would you shut up
and go back to work?

06:28.355 --> 06:32.493
You know, Lion's fighting Lefty
Denunzio tonight down at Raoul's.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.894
And who the fuck
is that?

06:34.028 --> 06:35.829
Just some dude
who's old as shit.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.932
You should come.
It's gonna be fun.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.934
The odds are stacked
up against us.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.003
I mean, it's stupid, bro.
We can't lose.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.573
You can come in right
now on the ground floor.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.842
You're a bookie for your own team, huh?

06:48.976 --> 06:52.079
Kaminsky, you're
a fucking weasel, man.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.151
Why you gotta be like that, Clem?

06:57.284 --> 07:00.487
See, this is your problem. That's why you're
going to be here for the rest of your life.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.490
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Making tea towels and shit.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.792
While me and Lion,
we're gonna be over in California.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.294
Right, bro?

07:08.229 --> 07:09.463
Building
the Lion brand.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.665
- Ooh.
- Making tracksuits, sweatshirts,

07:11.798 --> 07:13.267
getting sucked off
by movie stars.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.869
Who's gonna suck you off
with them fucked-up shoes?

07:16.003 --> 07:17.905
Oh, sorry. Excuse me, man.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.608
- I gotta take this. Yo, Lion.
- Fucked-up shoes, talking about getting sucked.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.142
Cover me, all right?

07:32.119 --> 07:35.122
Fucking nice car, man.

07:35.256 --> 07:36.657
I always wanted
one of these.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.359
You got the money?

07:40.494 --> 07:42.162
Yeah, I got it.

07:43.364 --> 07:45.765
Pepper couldn't bother
showing up himself, huh?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.635
Yeah, I guess
he's big-time now.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.637
That's cool.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.105
It's cool.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.642
What is this?
Pepper said you owe him two grand.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.410
It's all I got.

07:57.278 --> 07:59.580
Un-fucking-believable,
man.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.948
Buck...

08:02.650 --> 08:05.085
ask Pepper if he'll let it
ride on the fight tonight.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.220
What?

08:06.353 --> 08:09.123
Come on, the kid's
looking unbelievable.

08:10.391 --> 08:12.059
You never learn,
do you, Kaminsky?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.361
I'm just excited.
Pow, pow.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.230
You're gonna get your legs broken, man.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.966
I'm telling you,
it's a sure thing.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.008
- Ah, all right.
- We good?

08:28.142 --> 08:30.177
He says he'll float you
the rest.

08:30.311 --> 08:33.480
- All right!
- Get out of the car, man.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.717
- Close the door.
- Buy this car off you tomorrow.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.593
How you feeling?

08:46.727 --> 08:47.895
- Great.
- Yeah?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.263
Yeah, I feel great.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.231
You know,
we cannot afford to lose tonight.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.501
Yeah, I know.
How much is the cut?

08:54.635 --> 08:57.104
Look, you don't need to worry about
that, all right?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.439
You handle your business
in there,

08:58.572 --> 09:00.974
and we will get a cut
you will not believe.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.713
I mean, a win tonight will
open up a lot of doors for us.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.748
We could change
our lives tonight.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.849
All right.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.617
Come on, give me
a little roar.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.286
- Let me hear you roar.
- No, man.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.621
- I'm trying to focus.
- Give me a little roar, Lion.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.024
What, are you
fucking embarrassed

09:17.157 --> 09:18.759
- in front of the dishwashers?
- No.

09:32.841 --> 09:34.942
Use the jab.
Use the jab.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.389
He can't touch you.
This guy's older than dirt!

09:49.590 --> 09:51.358
Beautiful!

09:52.359 --> 09:53.660
Beautiful.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.996
Make him fight
another day.

09:57.231 --> 09:59.466
Yes! Yes! Come on!

10:01.468 --> 10:03.203
That's it!
Stay down! It's over.

10:03.337 --> 10:06.173
You're too old for this, man.
You look awful.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.676
Let him up.
Let him up.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.248
That-a-boy!
Work the kidneys!

10:14.381 --> 10:17.551
Work the kidneys!
Make this motherfucker piss blood!

10:20.788 --> 10:22.656
Don't get stuck!

10:26.260 --> 10:27.795
That's it! Work the kidneys!
That-a-boy!

10:27.928 --> 10:30.431
- What is he doing here, Stan?
- What are you talking about?

10:30.564 --> 10:31.866
What the fuck
is he doing here?

10:34.701 --> 10:37.204
- That's nothing to do with us!
- You made a deal with...

10:37.337 --> 10:39.206
No, man!
That's nothing to do...

10:39.339 --> 10:41.241
Lion! Protect yourself!

10:42.176 --> 10:45.379
Protect yourself!
Lion! Block!

10:47.916 --> 10:50.217
Done. Done.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.286
All right, I'm done.

10:58.927 --> 11:00.761
You were supposed
to win, Lion.

11:01.863 --> 11:04.364
You shouldn't have lied to me, Stan.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.835
You told me you wasn't gonna
deal with that scumbag no more.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.136
Yeah, well,
we needed the money.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.143
Stanley, where the hell
are we gonna go, man?

11:16.276 --> 11:19.948
You know, for a guy who hates
moving as much as you do,

11:20.080 --> 11:23.016
you really don't do much
to help the cause.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.687
You were supposed
to fucking win.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.723
Okay, Ash, come on.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.166
Jesus!

11:39.299 --> 11:42.135
Fuck!

11:44.004 --> 11:45.439
Where you going?

11:48.642 --> 11:51.111
Hey, I was looking
for you at the fight, man.

11:51.245 --> 11:53.647
I didn't see you.
Did you not make it?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.582
Fuck!

12:09.329 --> 12:12.432
<i>You owe me money
you don't have.</i>

12:12.566 --> 12:14.101
<i>I could kill you tonight,</i>

12:14.234 --> 12:16.270
<i>but I'd never get a return
on my investment,</i>

12:16.403 --> 12:19.606
<i>so I'm offering you
an opportunity.</i>

12:25.013 --> 12:26.413
Jungleland.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.317
Battle royal for 100K.

12:31.218 --> 12:35.155
Wild-ass, no-holds-barred,
bare-knuckle event.

12:35.289 --> 12:36.690
A week from today.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.693
I can get you
on the card.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.329
- I could do that.
- Why?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.598
Let's not look a gift horse
in the mouth here. This is...

12:44.731 --> 12:47.668
No, I'm asking him why.
Nothing for nothing with you. Right, Pep?

12:49.703 --> 12:51.138
I saw you.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.208
I saw the way you moved
before you took that dive.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.777
That look in your eye.

12:56.911 --> 12:58.378
That...

12:58.512 --> 13:00.480
That rage.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.984
Heard you could've been
Golden Gloves

13:03.116 --> 13:05.285
out in Hartford before Stan
got your ass kicked out

13:05.419 --> 13:06.720
the way he always do,
right?

13:06.854 --> 13:09.256
Now, wait, that was
a complicated situation.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.825
Now look at you.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.429
Fighting like a fucking savage.
For what?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.464
Peanuts?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.133
Plus,
you got no choice.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.574
Where?

13:27.708 --> 13:28.742
San Francisco.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.583
There is one thing
I need.

13:42.356 --> 13:43.757
Are you decent
in there?

13:50.631 --> 13:54.434
Sky...
meet Stan Kaminsky.

13:55.736 --> 13:59.172
Him and his brother, Lion,
they'll take you out west.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.575
Come on, Pepper.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.211
I can't be
moving girls right now.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.379
No, it ain't
like that.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.948
I don't know...

14:07.081 --> 14:09.216
I'd handle it or
have one of my guys handle it,

14:09.349 --> 14:11.418
but, look,
she's a friend of the family.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.153
Here's my
problem, all right?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.721
It's always been
the two of us.

14:14.856 --> 14:17.859
- This could be a complication.
- She's cool. She's cool.

14:17.992 --> 14:20.128
She's a bit of a
handful, but she's cool.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.628
Just keep an eye
on her.

14:21.762 --> 14:23.865
All right.
Just 'cause I gotta ask.

14:23.998 --> 14:26.400
This doesn't have anything
to do with Yates, does it?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.670
- 'Cause I'm just not trying to be...
- Stanley.

14:30.504 --> 14:31.939
Take her
to this address

14:32.073 --> 14:35.375
by this time next week,
and Lion stays on the card.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.546
- "Party Animals"?
- Don't fuck it up.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.516
Opportunities like this
don't knock twice.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.692
Hey.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.313
You serious?

15:13.447 --> 15:14.581
I left some petty cash

15:14.715 --> 15:17.551
and a special gift for you
in the glove.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.519
Told you
this was my car.

15:21.455 --> 15:25.292
We're in an economic
boom, Kaminsky.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.294
Go forth, prosper.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.366
What the fuck?

15:47.849 --> 15:49.917
<i>If you
understand the building blocks</i>

15:50.051 --> 15:52.719
<i>of key relations,
you can have ultimate success.</i>

15:52.854 --> 15:55.689
<i>It's the pyramid
of achievement.</i>

15:55.823 --> 15:59.026
<i>It is only in our darkest
moments, our moment...</i>

17:01.421 --> 17:03.157
Are you still
working on that?

17:03.291 --> 17:04.225
Go right ahead.

17:07.561 --> 17:09.496
That's quite an
appetite you got on you.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.332
You ever take a break
to talk?

17:14.135 --> 17:16.037
What's with
the rattail?

17:16.170 --> 17:18.772
I had it since,
like, forever.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.507
I'm thinking
of cutting it.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.310
No, you're not.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.376
You should.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.512
You see?

17:25.645 --> 17:27.949
You don't know what
you're talking about.

17:28.082 --> 17:29.583
That's
his lion's tail.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.418
This gives him power.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.188
Look at him.
He's like a wild animal.

17:34.322 --> 17:37.724
Get off me, man. Fuck off, Stan. Jesus.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.928
Hey.
I love you.

17:41.062 --> 17:42.163
All right.

17:42.296 --> 17:43.931
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.970
Tell us
about yourself.

17:49.103 --> 17:51.272
I like to know who
we're traveling with.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.373
What do you
want to know?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.375
Like, who you are.
What do you do?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.644
Where are you from?
Anything.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.348
Look, you seem like
really nice guys.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.050
I'm just not really
in the mood to talk.

18:05.353 --> 18:06.753
Gotcha.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.562
I do have one other
question though.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.797
Just...
Last question.

18:21.969 --> 18:23.804
Are you like a...

18:25.505 --> 18:27.674
Am I what?

18:30.111 --> 18:31.145
I mean,
you know.

18:34.315 --> 18:35.782
A pro.

18:35.917 --> 18:39.287
- Stan. Come on.
- I just meant because of the circumstances.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.188
I'm not a hooker.

18:41.322 --> 18:43.657
It's nice to know I make a
good first impression though.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.126
That's all
I wanted to know.

18:45.259 --> 18:48.528
We don't think that, okay?
My brother's an idiot.

18:48.662 --> 18:52.066
I'm not an idiot,
I just...

18:54.135 --> 18:56.469
We've been working
towards something.

18:56.603 --> 19:00.774
Something...
Something very big, all right?

19:00.908 --> 19:04.178
I mean, these are spectacular
goals we're talking about.

19:04.312 --> 19:08.149
And since we gotta spend the
next week together, I just...

19:09.350 --> 19:12.853
I just need there to be a level
of trust between us, that's all.

19:14.989 --> 19:17.557
I gotta
use the bathroom.

19:18.359 --> 19:19.961
Again?

19:20.094 --> 19:24.031
I'm sorry. Is that in violation
of your spectacular goals?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.702
I think she's doing
drugs in there.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.137
She seems
kind of cool.

19:30.271 --> 19:32.306
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.673
Hey,
look at me.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.776
No distractions.

19:39.713 --> 19:41.382
- All right?
- Come on. Just be nice, Stan.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.118
- Come on. It's nice to be nice.
- I'm nice. I'm always nice.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.720
Got a hundred
grand on the line.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.655
We good to go,
princess?

20:21.188 --> 20:22.589
Looks like you're
in luck, folks.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.226
So, that's one night
in the Caesar suite?

20:25.960 --> 20:27.527
That's the nicest
suite you got?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.363
The Caesar is the
only suite we offer.

20:29.497 --> 20:30.931
We'll take it.

20:31.065 --> 20:34.435
Do you have a
card to hold the reservation?

20:40.408 --> 20:42.176
Sir?

20:45.446 --> 20:47.081
I'll pay cash,
amigo.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.087
Don't trust the banks.

21:01.661 --> 21:06.467
Pass the fucking
grappa, baby.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.436
There's a hot tub.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.304
And only one bed.

21:13.007 --> 21:15.209
Requesting backup.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.479
We got a hot tub situation
over at the Venus de Milo.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.183
Gonna need 12 Coors Lights
and three Mountain Dews, stat.

21:22.316 --> 21:24.285
Do you guys mind
if I jump in here first?

21:24.418 --> 21:25.352
Sure, go ahead.

21:25.486 --> 21:27.587
I'd actually...

21:30.458 --> 21:32.126
All right.

21:33.327 --> 21:34.627
You want to do this?

21:46.207 --> 21:49.176
- You want some of this?
- Don't knock the fucking ribs, man, don't.

21:49.310 --> 21:52.012
Want to fight? Want the toe pop?
Want the toe pop?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.783
Not the toe!
Not the toe.

21:56.917 --> 21:59.153
You get the toe.
You get the toe.

21:59.286 --> 22:01.956
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

22:03.057 --> 22:04.592
Got you back.
I got you back.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.527
- You ain't got nothing.
- Oh, shit.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.262
Rear naked choke.

22:08.395 --> 22:11.265
- You ain't got it. You ain't got shit.
- After I put you out.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.436
You ain't got it.
You ain't got this.

22:15.569 --> 22:19.273
- Not that hard to put you out.
- All right, all right.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.877
Motherfucker.

22:28.115 --> 22:29.316
All right.

22:30.184 --> 22:32.119
You want to watch
something?

22:36.957 --> 22:38.259
Want to watch that?

22:38.392 --> 22:39.994
<i>A strong showing
tonight by Kreski.</i>

22:40.127 --> 22:41.562
<i>Obviously,
he's in the middle of three</i>

22:41.694 --> 22:42.830
<i>of his most exciting
performances.</i>

22:42.963 --> 22:44.298
<i>First with Nunes,</i>

22:44.431 --> 22:46.967
<i>then last month against
Pirelli, and now tonight,</i>

22:47.101 --> 22:50.471
<i>a career-making caliber fight
against the champion, Emmet.</i>

22:52.239 --> 22:54.842
<i>A strong, experienced,
and very motivated opponent.</i>

22:54.975 --> 22:56.544
<i>Well, at 5'7" and 159,</i>

22:56.676 --> 22:59.880
<i>this middleweight is just one
pound from light heavyweight...</i>

23:00.014 --> 23:02.216
I'm going to
take Ash for a walk.

23:02.349 --> 23:03.184
I'll be back.

23:03.317 --> 23:05.319
<i>Thirteen KO victories</i>

23:05.452 --> 23:07.354
<i>in 19 professional fights.</i>

23:13.661 --> 23:15.462
Get dressed, Rocky.
We're going out.

23:15.596 --> 23:16.864
Where?

23:16.997 --> 23:19.166
Saw a bar around the
corner we could go to.

23:20.534 --> 23:22.970
Cheers to new friends.

23:39.153 --> 23:40.753
What's happening,
boss?

23:40.888 --> 23:42.356
- Did you see those...
- Whoo!

23:42.489 --> 23:44.491
Darlene, get your
fuckin' ass out here!

23:44.625 --> 23:45.993
Never mind.

23:57.204 --> 23:58.305
Hi.

23:59.907 --> 24:03.344
I came to say congratulations.

24:03.477 --> 24:04.511
He's a lucky man.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.547
Oh, um...

24:06.680 --> 24:08.449
It's my sister Gina.

24:08.582 --> 24:10.551
I don't know why I'm
wearing that stupid thing.

24:10.684 --> 24:12.785
Which one's Gina?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.555
Uh... go big
or go home.

24:16.457 --> 24:18.791
- Savage.
- Yeah.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.029
I like your pants.

24:22.162 --> 24:25.232
- Yeah? Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:25.366 --> 24:26.967
They're from Italy.

24:27.101 --> 24:29.803
I like the way
they make my dick look.

24:33.207 --> 24:36.310
You're funny.

24:36.443 --> 24:39.346
Yeah.
So, did, uh...

24:40.314 --> 24:42.216
Gina get you
your own room?

24:43.350 --> 24:47.488
Mm-mmm. I'm sharing with
six other girls and my aunt.

24:48.255 --> 24:50.724
- I got the Caesar suite, but...
- Oh.

24:50.858 --> 24:52.593
...I'm sharing
with my brother.

24:52.726 --> 24:55.763
He's resting right now.
He's a professional athlete, so...

24:55.896 --> 24:58.832
- Wow.
- You know how that goes.

24:59.767 --> 25:01.168
Hmm. Well...

25:02.703 --> 25:04.171
There's a pool.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.641
You think it's heated?

25:07.775 --> 25:10.544
Do you actually care?

25:23.924 --> 25:25.292
Thanks.

25:27.461 --> 25:28.529
If I went to college,

25:28.662 --> 25:30.798
I wouldn't waste my time
playing stupid games

25:30.931 --> 25:32.866
like these rich pricks.

25:34.635 --> 25:36.737
Yeah, me neither.

25:36.870 --> 25:39.940
I bet you'd be too busy getting
it on with all the girls, huh?

25:40.074 --> 25:42.976
No, I mean I'd be taking
my classes real seriously

25:43.110 --> 25:44.578
'cause of
how expensive it is.

25:44.712 --> 25:47.414
I would read
a bunch of books

25:47.548 --> 25:50.284
where you gotta, like,
know shit to understand them,

25:50.417 --> 25:52.920
and I would study
theater and fashion.

25:53.053 --> 25:55.322
Yeah, you like to sew, right?

25:56.323 --> 25:58.692
I saw what you did at
the hotel with the robe.

25:58.827 --> 26:00.728
And your name?

26:00.861 --> 26:03.063
It looked good,
like, professional.

26:04.365 --> 26:05.399
Thank you.

26:08.769 --> 26:13.006
Me and Stan wanna get our initials
stitched onto some dress shirts.

26:13.140 --> 26:14.942
So, if we make
a bit of money,

26:15.075 --> 26:18.445
hopefully we can
afford your talents.

26:21.248 --> 26:23.283
My mom taught me
how to do that.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.652
Yeah? Where?

26:26.286 --> 26:28.088
Some boring-ass town.

26:28.222 --> 26:30.524
Not that far from here,
actually.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.896
I'm not really
that interesting.

26:36.997 --> 26:38.799
What about you?
Where are you from?

26:38.932 --> 26:40.835
All over.

26:40.968 --> 26:43.570
New Bedford, Portsmouth,

26:43.704 --> 26:45.939
Hartford, Nashua,

26:46.073 --> 26:48.208
everywhere.

26:48.342 --> 26:52.212
You got parents,
or does Stanley cover that too?

26:53.414 --> 26:56.049
Our mom died
when I was real young.

26:58.786 --> 27:00.053
What about your dad?

27:00.187 --> 27:03.090
Well, he didn't want us. So...

27:06.927 --> 27:11.198
That must've been lonely, you
know, not having any parents.

27:11.331 --> 27:13.233
Well,
I always had my brother.

27:17.271 --> 27:19.206
You got any scars?

27:20.441 --> 27:21.608
I got some.

27:21.742 --> 27:24.211
All on my hands, though.
Not on my face.

27:24.344 --> 27:26.480
- Can I touch it?
- If you want.

27:28.649 --> 27:30.852
Go ahead.
Just do it.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.712
You don't seem
like a boxer to me.

27:58.847 --> 28:00.581
What do you mean?

28:01.415 --> 28:03.952
I don't know.
You haven't got that thing.

28:04.084 --> 28:07.654
What thing? This thing?

28:08.957 --> 28:10.624
I don't walk around going
like this to people?

28:10.757 --> 28:13.828
"What the fuck are you looking
at, huh?

28:13.962 --> 28:15.496
I'm a fucking ogre."

28:15.629 --> 28:16.563
Exactly.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.232
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.200
Get the fuck
out of here.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.704
It's a compliment.

28:26.073 --> 28:28.208
I'll take
the compliment.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.444
Maybe that's
my advantage.

28:31.946 --> 28:34.581
People underestimate you.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.117
I guess.

28:39.854 --> 28:41.421
Me too.

29:00.875 --> 29:02.109
Whoo!

29:15.924 --> 29:17.491
Lion.

29:21.128 --> 29:23.063
Lion.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.313
Oh, fuck.

29:41.648 --> 29:42.817
Oh, fuck.

29:51.059 --> 29:52.492
Fucking assholes.

29:53.660 --> 29:54.795
What?

29:55.762 --> 29:57.164
What?

29:57.297 --> 30:00.400
He said the only way that we can
play is if I give him a blow job.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.339
He said that?

30:05.472 --> 30:07.008
Can we just get
the fuck out of here?

30:07.140 --> 30:08.709
Shit.

30:08.843 --> 30:10.677
Lion, don't.

30:10.812 --> 30:13.647
How's it going?
All right?

30:13.780 --> 30:14.615
How's it going?

30:14.748 --> 30:16.283
Doing pretty good.
What's up, bro?

30:16.416 --> 30:18.052
I just want to know
why you think it's okay

30:18.185 --> 30:19.854
to speak to my friend
like that.

30:19.988 --> 30:22.723
Uh, I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

30:22.857 --> 30:24.558
Yes, you do.

30:24.691 --> 30:27.862
She said you said something real
impolite to her. I want to know why.

30:27.996 --> 30:30.865
No, she came over and
asked me about my belt.

30:30.999 --> 30:32.033
You are a liar.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.300
- What did I say?
- I came over here.

30:33.433 --> 30:34.534
I asked
if we could play.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.203
You said the only way
I could play

30:36.336 --> 30:38.538
- is if I gave you a blow job.
- Okay, all right.

30:38.672 --> 30:41.441
See, here's the problem.
This bitch is fucking insane.

30:41.575 --> 30:43.310
You should beat the
fucking shit out of him.

30:43.443 --> 30:45.278
Isn't there a townie bar
you guys can go over to?

30:45.412 --> 30:46.680
We're not
fucking townies.

30:46.814 --> 30:49.316
And fuck you! I'll scratch
your fucking eyes out!

30:49.449 --> 30:51.019
Look down on me,
you piece of shit?

30:51.151 --> 30:53.553
- Orphan Annie, you know what?
- Sorry. Hey!

30:53.687 --> 30:56.356
- My boyfriend is a boxer.
- Something will get you.

30:56.490 --> 30:58.625
Something will get you.
That's all I want you to know.

30:58.759 --> 31:01.461
- Something or somebody will get you.
- Are you drinking?

31:01.595 --> 31:03.563
What are you doing?
You fucking drinking? You drunk?

31:03.697 --> 31:05.967
- I'm having a couple drinks. Why?
- Just everyone,

31:06.100 --> 31:07.300
go back to what
you were doing.

31:07.434 --> 31:10.270
Who are you,
the fucking social worker?

31:10.404 --> 31:12.140
Why you being
an asshole?

31:12.272 --> 31:15.275
Why don't you go to the bar.
I got a tab open. Name's Clay.

31:15.409 --> 31:16.576
Get yourself
whatever you want.

31:16.710 --> 31:18.311
Oh, I see. We can't afford
our own drinks?

31:18.445 --> 31:20.180
- Is that what you're implying?
- I didn't say that.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.950
- That's what you thought though, right?
- Maybe a little.

31:23.084 --> 31:25.419
- You're not listening to me.
- I gotta go sit.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.355
Guys like us don't have the luxury
of settling things with credit cards.

31:28.488 --> 31:31.092
- We gotta go outside, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

31:31.224 --> 31:33.694
Toe to toe.
On the street.

31:33.828 --> 31:35.963
But that's not what you
do, is it?

31:37.531 --> 31:39.901
'Cause you don't know
what it's like to suffer.

31:40.034 --> 31:42.769
I mean, do you know what
it's like to be in pain?

31:43.503 --> 31:46.074
I've been to
fucking prison, man.

31:46.206 --> 31:47.774
You know?

31:47.909 --> 31:51.045
- Check that out. Check that out.
- Okay, all right.

31:51.179 --> 31:52.345
No, I'm not causing
a problem.

31:52.479 --> 31:53.848
I'm just saying,
you can be nice.

31:53.981 --> 31:55.016
Yep, I'm being nice.

31:55.149 --> 31:56.249
Your buddy
just passed out!

31:56.383 --> 31:57.952
- Nice guy.
- Hey.

31:58.086 --> 32:00.154
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

32:00.287 --> 32:01.521
What are you doing?

32:03.323 --> 32:05.325
- Where the fuck is Sky? Get up.
- What?

32:05.459 --> 32:07.829
You just hit
my fucking car!

32:10.430 --> 32:12.066
- Hey, are you okay?
- Sky!

32:12.200 --> 32:13.433
Should I call somebody?

32:13.567 --> 32:15.769
What the hell
are you doing?

32:15.903 --> 32:18.505
- Hey! Where you going?
- Wait there.

32:18.638 --> 32:20.340
Sky!

32:23.177 --> 32:24.411
Sky!

32:25.245 --> 32:26.379
Slow down!

32:26.513 --> 32:28.281
Sky!

32:28.415 --> 32:30.852
What are you doing?

32:31.185 --> 32:32.652
Sky!

32:34.188 --> 32:35.722
Get away!
Get away from me!

32:35.857 --> 32:37.859
- What the fuck is going on?
- Get away! Get off me!

32:37.992 --> 32:39.827
What the fuck did you
do to my brother?

32:39.961 --> 32:41.695
Get off! Get off!

32:41.829 --> 32:43.730
- Calm down.
- Get the fuck away from me.

32:43.865 --> 32:46.200
- Get away!
- You're gonna get us fucking arrested.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.137
Calm down! Calm down!

32:50.004 --> 32:51.705
All right, look,
I'll take my hand away,

32:51.839 --> 32:54.242
but you gotta tell me
what the fuck is going on.

32:54.374 --> 32:57.677
Help me!
I won't fucking go back to him!

32:57.812 --> 32:59.279
Go back to who?

32:59.412 --> 33:01.348
Yates?

33:01.481 --> 33:03.217
She's with fucking Yates?

33:03.350 --> 33:05.253
I specifically fucking
asked you, man.

33:05.385 --> 33:07.621
- <i>You're overreacting.</i>
- You didn't want to take any of the heat,

33:07.754 --> 33:09.556
so you put it on me,
like I'm some kind of chump.

33:09.689 --> 33:11.725
<i>You had a debt to pay, Stan!
And somebody...</i>

33:11.859 --> 33:14.128
You fucking set me up,
Pepper!

33:14.262 --> 33:15.863
<i>Listen,
motherfucker,</i>

33:15.997 --> 33:18.632
<i>I don't owe you shit.
All right?</i>

33:18.765 --> 33:21.102
<i>Of course
I set you up.</i>

33:21.235 --> 33:22.602
Yates?

33:22.736 --> 33:24.504
You know,
Yates thinks you found Sky.

33:24.638 --> 33:26.908
<i>He thinks
you're responsible.</i>

33:27.041 --> 33:29.877
<i>You know, uh,
you owe me a debt.</i>

33:32.880 --> 33:36.884
Why the fuck am I
gonna look out for you?

33:37.018 --> 33:38.418
Hmm?

33:38.552 --> 33:40.387
You look out
for your brother.

33:41.155 --> 33:42.489
This is how
it works.

33:42.622 --> 33:46.726
<i>You said you wanted
to go to Jungleland.</i>

33:49.362 --> 33:51.165
Know what? You're right.

33:51.299 --> 33:52.799
You're right.

33:52.934 --> 33:55.803
<i>Then do as you're told,
Stanley.</i>

33:55.937 --> 33:57.305
No, I understand.

33:57.437 --> 33:59.841
<i>And take this girl
straight to Reno.</i>

33:59.974 --> 34:01.474
Yep.

34:01.608 --> 34:04.644
<i>Stan, listen to me.
This ain't one of Yates's side pieces.</i>

34:05.478 --> 34:07.581
<i>This is family business.</i>

34:08.381 --> 34:09.783
<i>Don't get cute.</i>

34:19.626 --> 34:23.030
You have to let me
get away from Yates.

34:23.164 --> 34:26.666
I made a deal,
and I can't get out of it.

34:28.468 --> 34:31.205
I fucked up...
really bad.

34:31.339 --> 34:33.074
And...

34:34.507 --> 34:36.878
And he is bad.

34:38.612 --> 34:40.413
He is a bad man
in his heart.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.516
Pack your shit.

34:43.650 --> 34:45.253
We're out of here
in five minutes.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.154
- Stan, why?
- Lion, pack for her.

34:47.288 --> 34:48.488
Where we going now?

34:48.622 --> 34:49.991
I'm sorry I crashed your
car, Stanley.

34:50.124 --> 34:52.425
Pack your shit.
We're not stopping till we get there.

34:52.559 --> 34:56.230
Please! He said he was gonna
kill me if I tried to run away!

34:56.364 --> 34:59.466
If we don't get you to Reno,
he's gonna kill us, so...

34:59.599 --> 35:01.869
Lion, you're not moving.
We gotta move, now.

35:02.003 --> 35:04.972
I have cash! I have loads of it!
You can have all of it.

35:05.106 --> 35:07.975
- Stan, look at her, man. She's pleading with you.
- Please, Stanley, please.

35:08.109 --> 35:10.510
Please take it, please.
Please take it.

35:10.644 --> 35:12.779
Please, just let me go,
please!

35:12.914 --> 35:15.249
Stan, look at her.
She's pleading with you, man.

35:15.383 --> 35:17.919
There's nothing
we can fucking do!

35:19.320 --> 35:20.687
Stan,
look at her.

35:20.821 --> 35:24.424
- Come on. Are we that low?
- Listen to me, Lion.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.295
- Stan.
- I feel for this girl.

35:27.427 --> 35:28.695
I really do.

35:28.829 --> 35:30.197
But she fucking
drugged you, man.

35:30.331 --> 35:32.432
It was just
a Xanax.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.534
Saturday night,

35:34.668 --> 35:37.405
we take
what's ours.

35:37.537 --> 35:40.573
The fucking alternative
is that he kills us.

35:44.946 --> 35:47.048
Do you hear
what I'm saying?

35:48.448 --> 35:49.850
Do you trust me?

35:50.952 --> 35:51.953
All right.

35:52.086 --> 35:54.221
Let's get the fuck out of
here, all right?

36:07.435 --> 36:09.937
- How are you?
- Like you give a shit.

36:10.071 --> 36:12.772
I'm trying to be civil.

36:12.907 --> 36:14.408
I wish
I could help you.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.844
But Stanley makes
every decision for you.

36:18.112 --> 36:21.182
Well, you lied to me,
you drugged me,

36:21.315 --> 36:23.583
and you smashed
our car, so...

36:24.919 --> 36:27.121
Doesn't mean
I don't like you.

36:31.558 --> 36:33.394
Sorry, Clay,

36:33.526 --> 36:35.262
your card
was declined.

36:36.330 --> 36:38.199
Oh, fuck.

36:40.267 --> 36:41.869
I don't have 1,400
on me.

36:42.003 --> 36:44.637
Well, you're the one who
needs it by tomorrow.

36:47.041 --> 36:50.077
Look, if we don't
get to San Francisco,

36:50.211 --> 36:54.081
we're gonna miss a big business
opportunity for my family.

36:54.215 --> 36:56.117
There's a lot of money
waiting for us there.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.784
Okay.

36:57.918 --> 37:00.921
So, once we get our hands on
it, we can cut you off a check.

37:01.055 --> 37:04.358
Call it 1,700
for your trouble?

37:04.492 --> 37:06.793
Yeah, that don't
work for us.

37:08.362 --> 37:09.596
Uh-huh.

37:13.868 --> 37:15.668
Hey, Sky,
how much cash you say you have?

37:15.803 --> 37:17.104
You can't take
my money.

37:17.238 --> 37:21.075
Actually, I can.
Lion, check her purse.

37:24.045 --> 37:25.545
All right.

37:27.481 --> 37:28.983
Hey, excuse me.

37:29.116 --> 37:32.520
You know, I didn't see title
or registration in the glove.

37:32.652 --> 37:34.822
Why you looking
in the glove?

37:35.655 --> 37:37.324
Kid, come on.

37:37.458 --> 37:40.261
- He's using you.
- Hold the dog.

37:44.664 --> 37:46.200
All right.

37:47.634 --> 37:49.170
What we got here?

37:56.377 --> 37:58.012
Short.

37:58.145 --> 38:01.748
Maybe you shouldn't have
sprung for the Caesar suite, moron.

38:01.882 --> 38:04.651
Maybe you
should shut the fuck up.

38:06.554 --> 38:08.788
Who's "Pam McGinty"?

38:08.923 --> 38:10.723
That card is expired.

38:14.295 --> 38:15.863
Gary, Indiana.

38:21.569 --> 38:23.237
How far is Gary
from here?

38:23.370 --> 38:25.439
<i>Now there is
Morris putting up a spot three.</i>

38:25.573 --> 38:28.775
They're not gonna help us.
This entire thing is pointless.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.945
<i>...with no one guarding him.</i>

38:31.078 --> 38:34.115
<i>Now it's Stockton
bringing it down.</i>

38:46.594 --> 38:47.895
Boys...

38:48.996 --> 38:50.297
how do you know Mary?

38:53.666 --> 38:55.336
We met at church.

38:55.903 --> 38:57.471
At a, uh,
church group.

38:59.039 --> 39:01.641
That must have been
a recent development.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.776
And what
church is that?

39:03.911 --> 39:06.046
It's called
the Church of All Seasons.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.348
Yeah.

39:07.481 --> 39:08.949
Wonderful church.

39:09.083 --> 39:12.987
Led by, uh,
Father, um...

39:13.954 --> 39:15.289
Denunzio.

39:15.422 --> 39:17.958
- Father Denunzio.
- Yep.

39:18.092 --> 39:20.194
The Lord is our shepherd.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.765
What is it you've
come here for, Mary?

39:27.101 --> 39:28.701
It's Sky.

39:31.539 --> 39:32.540
My name is Sky.

39:32.672 --> 39:33.908
I don't understand that.

39:34.041 --> 39:38.412
Why change such a pretty name
like Mary

39:38.546 --> 39:43.017
to something so stupid
like Sky?

39:45.819 --> 39:47.454
Nevertheless,

39:47.588 --> 39:49.156
perhaps you could answer,
Mary.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.959
Your father asked you
a question.

39:52.759 --> 39:54.061
I need some more money.

39:54.195 --> 39:55.795
What about
all that money you made

39:55.930 --> 39:57.898
from that place
where you danced?

39:58.032 --> 40:00.267
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble.

40:02.036 --> 40:03.871
I'm trying really hard
to be good.

40:04.004 --> 40:06.273
If we gave you
money again,

40:06.407 --> 40:08.275
what lesson would you
have learned?

40:08.409 --> 40:10.411
So, is that a "no"?

40:10.544 --> 40:12.279
Everybody needs a little
help from time to time.

40:12.413 --> 40:13.746
- You can just say no.
- Exactly.

40:13.881 --> 40:15.115
It's brave
to ask for help.

40:15.249 --> 40:16.749
- She's being reasonable.
- Reasonable.

40:16.884 --> 40:18.919
I didn't come here
to be a burden.

40:19.053 --> 40:20.421
- I'll get out of your hair.
- Mary!

40:20.554 --> 40:22.523
We talked about this.
We can't have this.

40:22.656 --> 40:26.260
We have to set a hard line. She can't
just come here when she needs money.

40:32.399 --> 40:33.867
It's not there.

40:34.668 --> 40:37.471
I moved it
after your last visit.

40:37.605 --> 40:38.973
Hey, wait for me.

40:39.106 --> 40:42.076
Mary, you'll never outrun
your circumstances

40:42.209 --> 40:45.112
if you continue
down this path of sin.

40:46.113 --> 40:47.715
Well, you made it look
really easy, Mom,

40:47.848 --> 40:49.817
with your new life
and your new husband.

40:49.950 --> 40:53.988
You poison everything you
come into contact with.

40:54.855 --> 40:57.324
But I'm not gonna
let you poison me.

40:57.992 --> 41:00.160
Get out
of my house.

41:09.036 --> 41:11.872
Okay, that's it.
Everyone, get out of my house.

41:12.006 --> 41:13.173
Take your shit
and get out.

41:13.307 --> 41:15.276
I want you
out of our home, now.

41:15.409 --> 41:18.078
These men are hustlers, and they
need to leave our house immediately.

41:18.212 --> 41:20.147
- Get out of our home.
- Call the police.

41:20.281 --> 41:22.716
- Don't call the cops.
- Get out.

41:22.850 --> 41:24.451
Get out of here!

41:24.585 --> 41:27.554
- We'll be going now. Right, Stan?
- Get out of my house!

41:41.302 --> 41:42.336
Yo.

41:45.873 --> 41:47.141
You all right?

41:47.274 --> 41:48.575
Yeah. Why?

41:51.779 --> 41:54.081
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

41:56.083 --> 41:58.919
I know a place
we can sleep tonight.

42:01.322 --> 42:02.790
All right, do it.

42:02.956 --> 42:05.025
- No...
- Fuck!

42:05.826 --> 42:07.795
- Fuck!
- Did it go through?

42:07.928 --> 42:10.064
Do it again, man.
Do it again.

42:10.197 --> 42:13.167
It has to go all the way...

42:26.480 --> 42:27.514
Fuck.

42:32.453 --> 42:34.054
I gotta pee.

42:34.188 --> 42:35.723
Yeah, well, you're not
doing jack shit

42:35.889 --> 42:37.558
without one of us
watching you.

42:42.396 --> 42:44.031
All right.

42:44.164 --> 42:46.133
Lion, you gotta
eat something.

42:46.835 --> 42:49.403
I'm gonna check out
the cafeteria.

42:49.536 --> 42:50.637
I'll take Ash.

42:50.771 --> 42:54.441
- Hey, don't let her out of your sight.
- All right.

43:13.994 --> 43:16.063
- Can you just go outside?
- No.

43:16.196 --> 43:18.599
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

43:24.873 --> 43:26.507
Make a noise.

43:40.187 --> 43:42.022
Cover your ears.

43:52.533 --> 43:55.669
<i>How much do you get for
winning one of these things?</i>

43:57.104 --> 43:58.639
A big fight?

43:58.772 --> 44:00.707
Couple hundred.

44:00.842 --> 44:04.311
You get your ass beaten
for a couple hundred bucks?

44:06.046 --> 44:07.648
Well, this fight
in San Francisco,

44:07.781 --> 44:09.416
we'd make a lot more.

44:11.585 --> 44:14.054
Why don't you box
with gloves?

44:14.188 --> 44:17.090
Well, we got
our license revoked.

44:18.425 --> 44:20.961
Stan tried
to bribe a ref.

44:27.768 --> 44:31.004
- You're not his possession.
- Yeah, I know.

44:33.942 --> 44:36.109
So, why do you
do it then?

44:42.951 --> 44:45.352
Can't you do
anything else?

44:49.924 --> 44:53.026
Got a business plan to
open up a dry cleaners.

44:55.696 --> 44:58.365
- A dry cleaners?
- Yeah.

44:58.499 --> 45:00.434
Hey, tell me
if this makes sense.

45:05.405 --> 45:07.441
So, Stan likes
his clothes, right?

45:07.574 --> 45:09.142
Yeah, right.

45:09.276 --> 45:12.079
No, he does.
He likes to dress smart.

45:12.212 --> 45:14.481
On fight night,
he really goes to town.

45:15.215 --> 45:17.351
And...
it'd be good for him.

45:17.484 --> 45:19.119
Something that he can
put his mind to,

45:19.253 --> 45:20.889
be hyperactive
and productive.

45:21.021 --> 45:24.491
What would happen is, say people
got, like, important events,

45:24.625 --> 45:27.127
like, uh, weddings
or baptisms.

45:27.261 --> 45:28.795
So, they need clothes
for it.

45:28.930 --> 45:30.464
Instead of getting
new clothes,

45:30.597 --> 45:33.567
they come to us, and we have
them looking real fucking smart,

45:33.700 --> 45:35.302
like brand-fucking-new.

45:35.435 --> 45:37.271
You see here?
Look, the best part.

45:37.404 --> 45:39.072
"Kaminsky Kleaners."

45:39.206 --> 45:40.574
Two Ks.

45:42.309 --> 45:43.310
That'll be
the hook.

45:43.443 --> 45:45.445
That's how
you get them.

45:46.179 --> 45:47.714
Kaminsky Kleaners.

45:49.516 --> 45:51.685
That's not asking
for that much.

45:58.425 --> 46:01.061
Well, hopefully,
after this next fight.

46:02.162 --> 46:04.999
I just gotta tell Stanley.

46:05.132 --> 46:07.334
You should stand up
to your brother.

46:08.168 --> 46:09.770
Do what you want
to do.

46:41.501 --> 46:44.204
I was in so many
stupid plays here.

46:45.606 --> 46:47.107
Thought I was really
hot shit.

46:47.240 --> 46:50.243
So I moved to New York
to become a dancer.

46:53.014 --> 46:54.448
And then what?

46:54.581 --> 46:56.617
Well,
I guess I wasn't.

47:01.288 --> 47:03.557
How did you come up
with "Sky"?

47:04.558 --> 47:06.193
I read it
in a book...

47:09.097 --> 47:10.797
and it sounded pretty.

47:14.068 --> 47:15.769
I wanted
to be free.

47:17.872 --> 47:19.907
I met Yates in a club.

47:21.174 --> 47:23.410
Promised me he was
gonna fix everything,

47:23.543 --> 47:27.314
but he turned out to be a
liar, just like everyone else.

47:29.282 --> 47:31.184
I'm the stupid one
though.

47:32.686 --> 47:35.255
Well, I don't think
you're stupid.

47:37.290 --> 47:39.626
I wanna dance for you.

47:41.863 --> 47:42.897
Where?

47:43.031 --> 47:44.264
Here.

47:46.134 --> 47:48.036
In the living room?

47:48.168 --> 47:49.937
- Yeah.
- All right.

48:24.172 --> 48:27.741
Ooh!

48:32.379 --> 48:34.414
Ah, you're
killing it, Sky.

48:44.192 --> 48:45.258
Lion!

48:54.135 --> 48:55.535
That's right.

48:56.636 --> 48:59.606
Ooh! Let's clap.
Clap.

49:00.808 --> 49:01.943
Whoo!

49:12.086 --> 49:15.288
Hey, don't stop on account of us.

49:31.738 --> 49:33.908
Better than
my mom's chicken.

49:34.041 --> 49:35.675
That's a fact.

49:36.978 --> 49:40.047
All right, I gotta go to bed.

49:40.181 --> 49:42.749
5:30 in the morning,
all right?

49:44.417 --> 49:46.553
Thanks
for the dance.

49:46.686 --> 49:49.322
Anytime.

49:54.327 --> 49:56.429
Sleep tight.

50:14.882 --> 50:17.952
You know, I was worried you
might try to bail tonight.

50:19.187 --> 50:21.055
I'm not gonna
run away again.

50:23.191 --> 50:25.358
I'm sorry
about your family.

50:26.260 --> 50:28.595
It's a fucking
rough one.

50:31.833 --> 50:34.367
What, do you want
to be friends now?

50:38.371 --> 50:40.373
I know what you're
trying to do, Sky.

50:40.507 --> 50:42.509
It's not gonna work.

50:42.642 --> 50:47.547
Me and him,
we're this close to our dream.

50:48.448 --> 50:49.817
I'm not gonna let you
or anyone else...

50:49.951 --> 50:51.819
- You don't know who I am.
- I know Yates.

50:51.953 --> 50:53.955
You don't know
why I do what I do.

50:55.857 --> 50:57.325
Look, Sky...

51:00.360 --> 51:03.030
I just can't let that kid
wake up at 40

51:03.164 --> 51:06.267
and wonder why he didn't do
what he was supposed to do

51:06.399 --> 51:08.702
when he had
the chance.

51:10.770 --> 51:14.075
That kid is better at
fighting than I ever been

51:14.208 --> 51:16.143
at anything
in my life.

51:17.812 --> 51:19.247
I'm not trying
to be a dick,

51:19.379 --> 51:21.082
but probably
you too.

51:25.119 --> 51:26.888
I mean,
he's special.

51:28.956 --> 51:31.524
And I'll never know
what that's like.

51:37.664 --> 51:40.234
The problem with
California is the taxes.

51:40.368 --> 51:41.601
Fuck it.

51:42.469 --> 51:43.804
After this fight,

51:43.938 --> 51:46.841
once we get this money,
we're gonna keep it.

51:46.974 --> 51:51.078
We'll be rolling in silk.
Monogrammed, perfect.

51:51.846 --> 51:54.215
We're gonna get us
a good two-bedroom.

51:54.348 --> 51:56.183
With a lease.
It's ours.

51:56.317 --> 51:59.186
And no one comes in that
place but you and me.

52:00.321 --> 52:02.656
There'll be
steak and wine.

52:02.789 --> 52:04.557
Steak
every morning.

52:06.493 --> 52:08.029
That's it. Let's go.

52:08.162 --> 52:09.830
Come on, faster!

52:10.563 --> 52:12.133
So,
turns out Gary

52:12.266 --> 52:13.633
didn't quite
work out for us.

52:13.767 --> 52:16.436
Well, there's nothing I
can do about that, sir.

52:16.569 --> 52:17.838
Come on, man.

52:17.972 --> 52:20.740
I'm sure there's
something we can do.

52:20.875 --> 52:24.378
Tell you what...
1,400, you get your truck back.

52:27.647 --> 52:30.418
I got
a crazy idea.

52:30.550 --> 52:31.919
How about
we fight for it?

52:32.053 --> 52:33.387
What's up?

52:33.520 --> 52:36.057
We lose, you keep the car.
We win, you do the work for free.

52:36.190 --> 52:38.993
My guy against world's
strongest man over here.

52:39.126 --> 52:41.329
- What you think?
- I'm good with that.

52:41.461 --> 52:42.662
Dude, no.

52:42.796 --> 52:44.298
No. Look,
this is a business.

52:44.432 --> 52:45.765
You need to get out
of here with that.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.301
I'm talking business. All right?

52:47.435 --> 52:49.236
As a businessman,
you should appreciate these odds.

52:49.370 --> 52:52.605
I mean, look at the size of this guy.
He's yoked.

52:53.874 --> 52:56.243
Just talk it over.
All right?

52:57.477 --> 52:59.679
Here's what's going on.
I don't want that...

52:59.814 --> 53:01.748
What the fuck,
Stan?

53:01.882 --> 53:03.783
I need you to step
up for the family.

53:03.918 --> 53:05.152
I'm recovering,
man.

53:05.286 --> 53:07.054
Come on, man.
You can knock this guy out.

53:07.188 --> 53:08.055
You knock him out.

53:08.189 --> 53:09.957
Hey, I'm cleaning up
your mess here.

53:10.091 --> 53:11.491
It's not his mess.
It's yours.

53:11.624 --> 53:13.493
Actually, it's yours.
So you wanna butt out?

53:13.626 --> 53:15.595
Look, no deal.

53:15.729 --> 53:18.232
You get your truck back
when we get the money.

53:22.236 --> 53:24.637
Guess we're gonna have to deal
with this a different way.

53:24.771 --> 53:28.708
Jesus. Stan, don't fucking do that, man.
What's wrong with you? You stupid?

53:28.843 --> 53:30.311
- What's the matter with you?
- Wise up.

53:30.444 --> 53:33.114
- What's the matter?
- Keep your shit tucked in. I got this.

53:33.247 --> 53:35.282
- I'm tucked.
- Keep your shit tucked in. I need to know.

53:35.416 --> 53:38.752
Oh, well, you were in retirement a second
ago. Now you're gonna do something?

53:38.886 --> 53:40.653
- ...come into the fucking shop.
- I get it.

53:40.787 --> 53:43.124
- How about two against one?
- What?

53:43.257 --> 53:45.759
- Two against one, for the car.
- Two what?

53:45.893 --> 53:48.329
Him and any one of these
guys, apart from him.

53:48.462 --> 53:49.830
- In a fight?
- Yeah.

53:49.964 --> 53:51.832
- Come on, man.
- You seem like honest guys.

53:51.966 --> 53:54.435
- Clean for the car. Clean fight. No stupid shit.
- No way!

53:54.567 --> 53:56.137
- No!
- Fellas, I got this.

53:56.270 --> 53:59.606
- I got this for sure.
- Stanley, you can't let him do that!

53:59.739 --> 54:01.674
We fight and whoever
wins, we settle it, yeah?

54:01.809 --> 54:03.576
This is
an unfair situation.

54:03.710 --> 54:04.644
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

54:04.778 --> 54:06.180
Come on.
All right.

54:06.313 --> 54:08.115
This kid's made up his mind.
There's nothing you can do.

54:08.249 --> 54:11.252
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go ahead, let's go.

54:14.321 --> 54:16.023
If I win,
I'm hanging on to the money.

54:16.157 --> 54:17.590
- No problem.
- And whatever happens,

54:17.724 --> 54:19.460
- keep that thing out of it.
- You got this.

54:19.592 --> 54:21.295
All right,
no scratching the eyes.

54:21.429 --> 54:22.830
No balls, no biting.

54:22.963 --> 54:25.066
Just clean, all right?
Respectable.

54:31.038 --> 54:32.139
Get up!

54:32.273 --> 54:33.307
Get up!

54:36.510 --> 54:37.710
Get up!

54:38.711 --> 54:41.382
Get up! Get up! Get up!

54:41.515 --> 54:42.550
- You done?
- Yeah.

54:42.682 --> 54:43.818
- We done?
- Oh, yeah.

54:43.951 --> 54:45.453
You're done,
man.

54:49.857 --> 54:51.525
Yes!

54:51.658 --> 54:53.394
Yes, that's right! Come on.

54:53.527 --> 54:56.596
Pay up.
Give me the keys.

54:56.729 --> 54:58.899
Come on. Give me
the fucking keys.

56:12.973 --> 56:15.409
- Could I get a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

56:20.281 --> 56:21.916
Last supper.

56:27.054 --> 56:29.023
Anyone gonna
say anything?

56:30.723 --> 56:32.792
Dad, look,
a whippet!

56:32.927 --> 56:34.828
Sorry for that.

56:34.962 --> 56:36.729
We've always wanted
one of these guys.

56:36.864 --> 56:39.867
His favorite book to read before
bedtime is <i>Wiley the Whippet.</i>

56:40.000 --> 56:41.635
You guys read that one?
It's great.

56:41.768 --> 56:43.070
Is he friendly?

56:43.770 --> 56:46.040
Not really,
dude.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.375
Jesus.

56:48.509 --> 56:51.912
I feel like we're in the
fucking Wookiee bar. Am I right?

56:52.046 --> 56:53.881
Stan,
we can't do this, man.

56:55.950 --> 56:57.418
Can't do what?

56:58.586 --> 56:59.920
Take her to Yates.

57:00.054 --> 57:02.656
Been through this, kid.
It's out of the question.

57:02.789 --> 57:04.024
Let's take her
to San Francisco.

57:04.158 --> 57:07.194
He knows where we're going.
All right?

57:07.328 --> 57:08.662
He will find us.

57:08.795 --> 57:11.966
Why don't we just bail and go
somewhere else? Fuck the fight.

57:13.701 --> 57:17.905
Why do you keep
making it like we got options?

57:18.672 --> 57:20.207
Like we got
all these sweet deals

57:20.341 --> 57:22.610
and people looking
to hook us up? We don't.

57:22.742 --> 57:24.478
We... We got options.

57:24.612 --> 57:26.779
We got one option.

57:26.914 --> 57:27.881
All right?

57:28.015 --> 57:30.384
We fight, that's it.

57:30.517 --> 57:32.152
I fight.

57:33.753 --> 57:35.122
That's right.

57:35.256 --> 57:37.825
You fight, and I'm the
business end of this company.

57:37.958 --> 57:39.293
Company?
What company?

57:39.426 --> 57:42.096
We're not a company, man.
We don't have a front door.

57:42.896 --> 57:45.132
To have a company,
you need a front door.

57:46.799 --> 57:48.801
All you do is...

57:50.804 --> 57:52.273
What?

57:55.775 --> 57:57.378
All I do is what?

57:58.879 --> 58:00.314
Cling on.

58:01.282 --> 58:02.850
And ruin shit.

58:11.492 --> 58:12.593
Sky tell you that?

58:12.726 --> 58:14.828
Don't make this about her.
I can think for myself.

58:14.962 --> 58:16.530
Then say that again.

58:16.664 --> 58:19.066
I dare you. Look me in the
eyes and say that again.

58:19.199 --> 58:21.368
'Cause I know
it takes you a minute.

58:25.439 --> 58:29.209
You use me and my talents
and what I'm good at.

58:30.044 --> 58:31.979
Everybody knows it.

58:32.780 --> 58:34.581
Oh, really?

58:34.715 --> 58:37.117
Everyone knows it,
huh?

58:38.519 --> 58:39.887
That's something.

58:40.020 --> 58:41.388
You're really something.

58:42.156 --> 58:44.792
You can't do anything
without me.

58:44.958 --> 58:46.794
I do everything.

58:46.927 --> 58:49.830
You got one talent. One.

58:49.963 --> 58:51.398
And that's your fists.

58:51.532 --> 58:53.767
I got things happening, all right?
I got shit going on.

58:53.901 --> 58:55.569
Oh, what you got?
You got some things?

58:55.703 --> 58:56.770
I got ideas.

58:56.904 --> 58:59.106
What, your dry-cleaning
business?

58:59.239 --> 59:00.374
Yeah.

59:02.476 --> 59:05.679
You can't do shit
like that, man.

59:05.814 --> 59:07.047
'Cause you're not smart.

59:07.181 --> 59:09.016
And what's
your plan, man?

59:09.149 --> 59:13.754
You think we're gonna get, like, a small
business loan? Is that what you think?

59:13.887 --> 59:15.789
That we're gonna use
our good credit

59:15.923 --> 59:18.926
to get a fine deal
on some retail space?

59:19.059 --> 59:22.763
Get one of those fucking machines that
swirl around so you can find your pants?

59:22.896 --> 59:25.032
Shh. Shh.

59:25.165 --> 59:27.768
I mean, what are we talking
about here? I use you?

59:27.901 --> 59:29.603
- What the fuck, man?
- Keep it down.

59:29.737 --> 59:31.605
- People are staring at us.
- I use you?

59:31.739 --> 59:33.540
Are you crazy?

59:33.674 --> 59:36.744
Hey, partner, it's
a family restaurant, man.

59:36.877 --> 59:39.814
Oh, then why don't you eat your
pizza with your fucking family?

59:39.947 --> 59:41.582
Stanley,
shut up.

59:42.583 --> 59:44.218
Unbelievable.

59:45.386 --> 59:46.887
I make sure
your hair's cut.

59:47.020 --> 59:49.056
I teach you
about fashion.

59:49.189 --> 59:51.892
I sleep on the hard floor
so you always got a bed.

59:52.025 --> 59:54.094
I skip meals so that
you're never hungry.

59:54.228 --> 59:56.397
And what do you do?

59:56.530 --> 59:57.866
What do you do?

59:57.998 --> 1:00:01.268
Nothing. What do you say?
Nothing. Ever.

1:00:01.402 --> 1:00:04.171
Do you know why?
Because it never occurred to you

1:00:04.304 --> 1:00:05.874
to have any gratitude
for the person

1:00:06.006 --> 1:00:07.674
who's given you
everything!

1:00:09.243 --> 1:00:12.980
I give you everything!
I ask for nothing in return!

1:00:13.113 --> 1:00:15.048
And it's a good job
because I don't get it!

1:00:15.182 --> 1:00:16.283
You're scaring the dog.

1:00:16.417 --> 1:00:17.518
You think I like
living like this?

1:00:17.651 --> 1:00:20.053
You think I like
having no possessions?

1:00:20.187 --> 1:00:23.624
I mean, I know I look like I got
it all covered, but I'm tired, man.

1:00:23.757 --> 1:00:26.895
Hang on, hang on. How many 25 year
olds you know got arthritis, huh?

1:00:28.662 --> 1:00:30.531
- I got fingers that don't bend.
- There's a dog there.

1:00:30.664 --> 1:00:32.232
I forget shit
that happened yesterday

1:00:32.366 --> 1:00:34.134
because my brain
don't fucking work.

1:00:34.268 --> 1:00:35.803
You think your
life's hard, Stan?

1:00:35.936 --> 1:00:38.305
Shit, I'd be a professional
boxer now if it wasn't for you.

1:00:38.439 --> 1:00:40.240
You are
a professional boxer.

1:00:40.374 --> 1:00:42.176
No, I'm not. I fight guys
two-on-one in parking lots

1:00:42.309 --> 1:00:43.912
so you don't
get another felony.

1:00:44.044 --> 1:00:47.314
I'm supposed to protect my fucking hands, Stan.

1:00:47.448 --> 1:00:48.949
I'm supposed
to protect my hands.

1:00:49.082 --> 1:00:50.885
You got me a job at a
fucking sewing factory.

1:00:51.018 --> 1:00:53.253
- Can you please quiet your dog?
- We're a joke.

1:00:53.387 --> 1:00:55.122
We're a fucking joke.

1:00:55.255 --> 1:00:56.790
If you don't
get that dog out of here,

1:00:56.925 --> 1:00:59.894
- I'm gonna call the police.
- I'm sorry. Quiet, Ash.

1:01:00.027 --> 1:01:02.529
- I love you.
- Good boy. Come on.

1:01:02.663 --> 1:01:03.730
She doesn't love you.

1:01:03.865 --> 1:01:05.032
Good boy.

1:01:05.165 --> 1:01:06.200
Can't you see that?

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:08.469
She's turning you
against me, man.

1:01:08.602 --> 1:01:11.672
- Dolores, call the cops.
- He's a service animal

1:01:11.806 --> 1:01:14.274
with fucking
documentation!

1:01:19.112 --> 1:01:22.817
- Get him out of here.
- Totally inappropriate.

1:01:22.951 --> 1:01:24.017
All right,
I'm sorry.

1:01:24.151 --> 1:01:27.020
Dolores, please,
don't call the cops.

1:01:27.154 --> 1:01:29.858
I'll get his papers from the car.
All right?

1:01:29.990 --> 1:01:31.458
In fact, better,
we'll leave.

1:01:31.592 --> 1:01:33.360
- Thank you!
- We'll take that to go.

1:01:33.494 --> 1:01:34.963
- Good.
- All right.

1:01:35.095 --> 1:01:37.197
Outside, you two, now.

1:01:39.901 --> 1:01:42.336
Oh, no. No.

1:01:45.974 --> 1:01:47.341
Fuck me.

1:01:47.474 --> 1:01:49.109
All right,
they're towing the car!

1:01:49.243 --> 1:01:51.111
- We gotta go!
- Walter, sit down.

1:01:51.245 --> 1:01:52.746
Come on!

1:01:52.881 --> 1:01:54.314
Get the fuck
out of my way.

1:01:54.448 --> 1:01:56.283
- I said it's a family restaurant!
- They're towing my car!

1:02:02.924 --> 1:02:04.558
Take this,
meet me out back.

1:02:04.691 --> 1:02:06.260
Hey, here.

1:02:10.664 --> 1:02:11.765
Right.

1:02:12.867 --> 1:02:14.201
Stolen.

1:02:14.334 --> 1:02:16.637
It's registered
in Massachusetts.

1:02:19.506 --> 1:02:20.240
Call it in?

1:02:20.374 --> 1:02:22.209
Yeah,
I just called.

1:02:31.785 --> 1:02:32.719
Fuck!

1:02:36.189 --> 1:02:37.859
Where's the money?

1:02:37.992 --> 1:02:40.627
Tell me you didn't leave
the money in the car.

1:03:15.095 --> 1:03:17.264
I'm gonna take Ash
for a walk.

1:03:27.274 --> 1:03:30.812
- I'm proud of you.
- For what?

1:03:31.612 --> 1:03:33.614
For standing up
to him.

1:03:47.461 --> 1:03:49.696
There's a 7:20 to Reno.

1:03:52.799 --> 1:03:54.068
All right.

1:03:54.201 --> 1:03:56.770
- They know we're coming.
- Where's Ash?

1:03:57.604 --> 1:03:58.940
What did you do
with Ash?

1:03:59.073 --> 1:04:00.707
Come on, let's go.

1:04:07.547 --> 1:04:08.850
What did you
fucking do?

1:04:08.983 --> 1:04:10.183
- Lion.
- Huh?

1:04:10.317 --> 1:04:11.451
What did you do?

1:04:11.585 --> 1:04:13.087
- We needed the money.
- Huh? Huh?

1:04:13.220 --> 1:04:15.890
- Lion...
- What? What fucking money?

1:04:16.024 --> 1:04:17.224
- You sold him?
- I loved him.

1:04:17.357 --> 1:04:18.993
- You sold my fucking dog?
- I loved him too.

1:04:19.127 --> 1:04:20.527
You sold
my fucking dog?

1:04:20.661 --> 1:04:21.996
He was my dog too!

1:04:22.130 --> 1:04:24.932
- He was my dog too! Lion, stop!
- Give me the money.

1:04:48.722 --> 1:04:51.725
<i>Approaching
Carson City Station.</i>

1:04:51.859 --> 1:04:55.595
- <i>Please remember to grab your belongings.</i>
- Sky.

1:04:55.729 --> 1:04:59.266
- Sky. Sky. Come on, shh.
- <i>Second to last stop.</i>

1:04:59.399 --> 1:05:02.937
- <i>Next and final stop, Reno, Nevada.</i>
- Come on. We're getting off.

1:05:19.352 --> 1:05:21.022
Excuse me.

1:05:21.155 --> 1:05:22.723
Excuse me, sir.

1:05:24.859 --> 1:05:26.760
Reno. Last stop.

1:05:36.204 --> 1:05:38.305
Where's my brother?

1:05:39.740 --> 1:05:40.942
I don't know.

1:05:46.214 --> 1:05:49.217
<i>Passenger
assistance to door 127, please.</i>

1:05:49.349 --> 1:05:51.651
- <i>Passenger assistance.</i>
- Kaminsky.

1:05:51.785 --> 1:05:53.921
Hey, what's happening,
fellas?

1:05:54.055 --> 1:05:55.655
Where's Sky?

1:05:55.789 --> 1:05:57.791
<i>All passengers

<i>Please remember to keep

1:06:32.093 --> 1:06:33.727
Twenty-three
dollars.

1:06:34.561 --> 1:06:36.296
Where do you
want to go?

1:06:37.165 --> 1:06:38.698
We don't have
enough money.

1:06:44.939 --> 1:06:47.674
<i>Next bus,
Tucson, Arizona.</i>

1:06:47.809 --> 1:06:50.443
<i>Next bus,
Tucson, Arizona.</i>

1:07:03.690 --> 1:07:06.459
I care about you,
Sky.

1:07:06.593 --> 1:07:08.162
I don't think you
deserve half this shit

1:07:08.296 --> 1:07:09.362
you're going through
right now.

1:07:09.496 --> 1:07:11.498
I think you deserve
a lot better.

1:07:11.631 --> 1:07:13.733
The way I feel right now is
I want to go to the booth,

1:07:13.868 --> 1:07:16.436
pick a place,
buy a ticket, and go.

1:07:17.872 --> 1:07:19.606
So, let's go pick a
place and go somewhere.

1:07:19.739 --> 1:07:21.474
We could go anywhere.
Where do you want to go?

1:07:21.608 --> 1:07:23.144
Pick a place.

1:07:23.277 --> 1:07:26.780
Do you like dry-cleaning?
You want to come dry-clean with me?

1:07:26.914 --> 1:07:28.515
Let's go do that.

1:07:28.648 --> 1:07:30.952
- What do you wanna do? We could...
- Lion.

1:07:31.085 --> 1:07:32.586
What?

1:07:34.322 --> 1:07:36.224
Shut up.

1:07:48.802 --> 1:07:50.537
Oh, shit.

1:07:54.175 --> 1:07:55.943
- Don't worry.
- Huh?

1:07:56.077 --> 1:07:57.410
Don't worry.

1:07:57.544 --> 1:07:59.579
It's fine.

1:08:01.315 --> 1:08:02.917
It's fine.

1:08:10.523 --> 1:08:12.860
It's fine.

1:08:12.994 --> 1:08:15.897
Shh. Shh.

1:08:16.696 --> 1:08:18.732
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

1:08:24.805 --> 1:08:27.808
Fifteen dollars in cash,

1:08:27.942 --> 1:08:30.978
an expired
driver's license,

1:08:31.112 --> 1:08:32.113
uh...

1:08:32.246 --> 1:08:36.117
...another man's
credit card.

1:08:36.250 --> 1:08:37.617
Oh.

1:08:37.751 --> 1:08:40.620
Now what do we have here?

1:08:40.754 --> 1:08:46.760
Is this the big stud
who stole my mama?

1:08:50.932 --> 1:08:54.001
Count to a hundred
before you leave

1:08:54.135 --> 1:08:57.138
so the bartender
doesn't get suspicious.

1:08:58.873 --> 1:09:01.541
He was giving me
weird looks.

1:09:06.247 --> 1:09:07.949
Is it Yates's?

1:09:14.121 --> 1:09:15.622
It's mine.

1:09:24.966 --> 1:09:27.168
We didn't touch her.

1:09:28.336 --> 1:09:34.008
Milos, uh, unmuzzle our friend, please.

1:10:01.135 --> 1:10:03.004
I swear to God...

1:10:03.770 --> 1:10:05.672
we didn't touch her.

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:10.044
She took my brother,
and she fucking ran.

1:10:12.346 --> 1:10:15.182
That feels like
an untruth.

1:10:16.750 --> 1:10:18.986
I don't know anything.

1:10:20.620 --> 1:10:23.157
Pepper, he didn't tell
us the whole story.

1:10:42.776 --> 1:10:45.246
A girl told me to
give this to you.

1:11:25.052 --> 1:11:28.389
<i>The 4:25 express
to Oakland now in the station.</i>

1:11:28.522 --> 1:11:30.757
<i>4:25 express to Oakland.</i>

1:11:38.566 --> 1:11:42.336
<i>Mr. Feldstein,
please return to the information desk.</i>

1:12:09.964 --> 1:12:12.632
The thing is,
Stanley,

1:12:12.765 --> 1:12:15.302
there's only so much

1:12:15.436 --> 1:12:17.304
money can do
for a man.

1:12:17.438 --> 1:12:18.939
I mean,
look around.

1:12:19.073 --> 1:12:21.674
I own a successful
chain of pet stores.

1:12:21.809 --> 1:12:24.612
I move women
through 19 states.

1:12:24.744 --> 1:12:27.882
I'm a successful
businessman.

1:12:28.015 --> 1:12:30.117
<i>But I've come
to the conclusion</i>

1:12:30.251 --> 1:12:33.287
<i>that possessions
don't matter.</i>

1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:36.756
A house isn't a home

1:12:36.891 --> 1:12:40.294
unless you have someone
to share it with.

1:12:41.929 --> 1:12:43.864
And in my heart...

1:12:44.965 --> 1:12:47.201
I think I might be...

1:12:48.602 --> 1:12:50.703
a family man.

1:12:56.844 --> 1:12:58.778
Nobody lives forever.

1:12:58.913 --> 1:13:00.014
Lord knows I'm trying.

1:13:00.147 --> 1:13:04.585
I take 37 vitamins a day.
Christ.

1:13:04.717 --> 1:13:06.921
I haven't pissed yellow
in ten years.

1:13:07.054 --> 1:13:10.324
You have any idea how...
how difficult it is

1:13:10.457 --> 1:13:12.893
for a man my age
to produce

1:13:13.027 --> 1:13:15.629
a viable sperm specimen?

1:13:15.762 --> 1:13:19.967
Oh, Lord, my cock
barely even works anymore.

1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:22.036
I had to use
one of those machines

1:13:22.169 --> 1:13:24.438
like they use
to milk cows.

1:13:24.572 --> 1:13:26.073
But it did the trick.

1:13:26.207 --> 1:13:30.044
And I finally
found my vessel.

1:13:31.645 --> 1:13:33.780
You mean Sky?

1:13:35.282 --> 1:13:36.684
Yes, Sky.

1:13:36.817 --> 1:13:38.785
Fuck! Fuck.

1:13:38.919 --> 1:13:41.255
Fucking hell!

1:13:42.089 --> 1:13:44.291
We had an arrangement.

1:13:44.425 --> 1:13:46.227
We made a deal.

1:13:47.394 --> 1:13:48.829
No!

1:13:52.499 --> 1:13:56.370
I'm not sure
what Pepper told you.

1:13:56.503 --> 1:14:00.941
- And guess what. It's a boy.
- I don't know anything.

1:14:01.075 --> 1:14:04.044
- I would never lie to you.
- All right, go. Go.

1:14:04.178 --> 1:14:06.380
You're not important
anymore, Stanley.

1:14:06.513 --> 1:14:11.218
So, tell me where Sky is,
or I'm gonna eat your fucking heart.

1:14:11.352 --> 1:14:13.187
You understand?

1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:16.423
We're talking
about my legacy here.

1:14:17.324 --> 1:14:19.159
I don't understand
what's happening.

1:14:19.293 --> 1:14:22.663
Sky belongs to me.

1:14:22.795 --> 1:14:24.965
Shit!

1:14:25.099 --> 1:14:27.668
Easy now!

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.737
Easy... Easy, tiger.

1:14:29.870 --> 1:14:31.572
Now,
just take it easy.

1:14:31.705 --> 1:14:34.208
I think we can
negotiate here.

1:14:40.114 --> 1:14:41.515
All right,
give me the knife.

1:14:42.249 --> 1:14:43.350
Knife.

1:14:45.019 --> 1:14:46.620
Let me put it
to you like this.

1:14:46.754 --> 1:14:48.555
Sky's gone.

1:14:48.689 --> 1:14:49.957
She ain't ever
coming back.

1:14:50.090 --> 1:14:53.360
She got her
hooks into you too, eh?

1:14:53.494 --> 1:14:55.996
When you see her,
don't forget to tell her

1:14:56.130 --> 1:14:58.899
that boy she's carrying
belongs to me.

1:14:59.033 --> 1:15:03.837
And I don't give a damn if I have to
cut that baby out of her belly myself.

1:15:03.971 --> 1:15:07.875
Sky will never live to
hold my boy in her arms.

1:15:58.827 --> 1:16:02.463
<i>All aboard,
407 to Emeryville. Last call.</i>

1:16:23.784 --> 1:16:25.319
You all right?

1:16:30.825 --> 1:16:32.626
Look, we don't have
to do this.

1:16:34.261 --> 1:16:37.564
We can just fucking bail right
now, start fresh.

1:16:38.332 --> 1:16:40.901
We done it
a thousand times before.

1:16:41.034 --> 1:16:43.036
Let's just get
the fuck out of here.

1:16:43.170 --> 1:16:46.039
Go somewhere where
no one knows us.

1:16:46.173 --> 1:16:48.008
No, we're fighting.

1:16:51.512 --> 1:16:53.247
We're fighting.

1:18:14.127 --> 1:18:15.796
Why you not talking?

1:18:26.473 --> 1:18:27.207
I'm sorry.

1:18:27.341 --> 1:18:29.176
Just stop, man.
Stop it.

1:18:29.309 --> 1:18:31.678
A-Anything I ever did
that hurt you, all right...

1:18:31.813 --> 1:18:34.515
Stop, stop, stop. Stop, man.
Stop. Let me focus.

1:18:34.648 --> 1:18:36.517
You're special.

1:18:36.650 --> 1:18:40.454
And you're the greatest
fucking thing I ever saw.

1:18:41.956 --> 1:18:44.725
Nothing bad's ever gonna
happen to you again.

1:18:51.231 --> 1:18:52.834
I'll protect you,
no matter what.

1:19:20.794 --> 1:19:22.629
All right.

1:19:35.309 --> 1:19:37.544
- How you feeling?
- Like shit.

1:19:37.678 --> 1:19:42.016
Out of shape,
unprepared... shit.

1:19:42.149 --> 1:19:44.318
<i>Kaminsky, one minute.</i>

1:19:47.021 --> 1:19:50.190
All right.
This is it. Showtime.

1:19:56.129 --> 1:19:58.298
- Here, check this out.
- What?

1:19:58.432 --> 1:20:01.234
Where the fuck did you get that?
Huh?

1:20:01.368 --> 1:20:04.504
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Jungleland.</i>
- Sky made it.

1:20:04.638 --> 1:20:06.808
- <i>In our second undercard of the night...</i>
- It's beautiful.

1:20:06.941 --> 1:20:11.778
- <i>...with a purse of $100,000, we have in the red corner...</i>
- I mean, that's a work of art.

1:20:11.913 --> 1:20:13.982
She's got some
real talent.

1:20:14.114 --> 1:20:18.920
- <i>With a record of 23, 2 and 1, Giomo!</i>
- You look like a fucking prince.

1:20:19.053 --> 1:20:20.621
Like a king.

1:20:20.754 --> 1:20:23.557
<i>In the blue corner,
from Fall River, Massachusetts,</i>

1:20:23.690 --> 1:20:27.028
<i>in his first professional
fight on the circuit,</i>

1:20:27.194 --> 1:20:30.263
<i>Walter "Lion" Kaminsky!</i>

1:20:44.078 --> 1:20:46.346
Coach. How you doing?

1:20:51.652 --> 1:20:52.954
Gentlemen,
welcome to Jungleland.

1:20:53.087 --> 1:20:55.389
Are we ready for this today?
Good clean fight.

1:20:55.522 --> 1:20:57.125
This is good here.
This is good here.

1:20:57.257 --> 1:21:00.260
Anything below that
is low. Got it?

1:21:00.394 --> 1:21:02.229
Touch gloves. I want you
out on the bell.

1:21:19.379 --> 1:21:22.182
Red corner ready?
Blue corner ready?

1:21:23.183 --> 1:21:24.118
Fight.

1:21:30.757 --> 1:21:33.326
Try to get on the inside.
Then outwork him, right.

1:21:33.460 --> 1:21:34.829
You're faster than him.

1:21:39.433 --> 1:21:41.568
Hey, ref, what the fuck?

1:21:41.702 --> 1:21:43.336
What the fuck
was that?

1:21:43.470 --> 1:21:45.272
- You all right?
- Yeah, back of the head, ref.

1:21:45.405 --> 1:21:47.407
Ref,
you gonna call that?

1:21:47.541 --> 1:21:48.943
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1:21:49.077 --> 1:21:50.210
Let's fight.
Come on.

1:21:50.343 --> 1:21:51.846
What, you got fucking
money on this guy?

1:21:57.151 --> 1:21:59.319
Guy's a fucking machine.

1:22:00.922 --> 1:22:02.689
Stay out
of the corner!

1:22:05.292 --> 1:22:07.360
Get out of the...

1:22:08.996 --> 1:22:11.565
Okay.
You're all right.

1:22:23.811 --> 1:22:26.546
- Stick to the move. All right?
- Two.

1:22:28.816 --> 1:22:30.818
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, yeah.

1:22:36.590 --> 1:22:38.792
No,
get out of the...

1:22:38.926 --> 1:22:41.062
Hey, out of the corner!

1:22:41.195 --> 1:22:43.563
Don't fucking trade
with him!

1:22:43.697 --> 1:22:45.900
Break. Break.

1:23:17.265 --> 1:23:18.232
Lion!

1:23:20.333 --> 1:23:22.937
Lion!
Lion, can you hear me?

1:23:23.070 --> 1:23:25.405
Lion, open your eyes!

1:23:25.539 --> 1:23:28.242
- Lion! Stay down.
- Two.

1:23:28.375 --> 1:23:30.111
Just stay down,
all right?

1:23:30.244 --> 1:23:31.478
Three.

1:23:31.611 --> 1:23:34.248
You don't have to do this.
You already won!

1:23:34.381 --> 1:23:35.817
- Four.
- You can throw this.

1:23:35.950 --> 1:23:38.152
- We'll do something else like we always do.
- Five.

1:23:42.322 --> 1:23:43.790
Six.

1:23:45.692 --> 1:23:48.196
- Just stay down, all right?
- Seven.

1:23:48.328 --> 1:23:50.363
Just let me call it.

1:23:50.497 --> 1:23:51.798
- Eight.
- I love you.

1:23:54.035 --> 1:23:56.204
Nine.

1:24:00.274 --> 1:24:01.741
Lion.

1:24:11.853 --> 1:24:15.156
You all right?
If I see something, I'm stopping it.

1:24:16.023 --> 1:24:18.625
Yeah! Come on! Yes!

1:24:18.758 --> 1:24:22.395
Beautiful, Lion!
Beautiful!

1:24:33.908 --> 1:24:35.009
Fight.

1:24:53.261 --> 1:24:54.561
I'm Stan Kaminsky.

1:24:54.694 --> 1:24:56.130
I believe you're
looking for me.

1:24:59.766 --> 1:25:01.168
You're under arrest.

1:25:08.775 --> 1:25:09.877
Yeah!

1:25:18.319 --> 1:25:19.552
Stan?

1:25:22.256 --> 1:25:23.590
Where's Stan?

1:25:26.894 --> 1:25:28.262
Where's my brother?

1:25:40.875 --> 1:25:43.911
Lion! Lion!

1:25:44.045 --> 1:25:45.346
Yes!

1:25:45.478 --> 1:25:47.514
Yeah!
