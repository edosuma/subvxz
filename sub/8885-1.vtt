Beautiful.

Very.

She's got this brother in Brighton and
she hasn't seen him for about five years,

give me a lift back to London?

31:46.880 --> 31:49.599
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.
We'll sort it tomorrow.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.636
Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt.

31:51.720 --> 31:54.075
Tomasz, don't block the car in.
It needs to be jump-started. Lan?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.229
Yeah.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.793
They like you. And they don't like anyone.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.389
(WHISTLING)

32:24.960 --> 32:27.554
CAROLINE: You did what you could.
LUKE: We need to show strength and unity.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.313
- The shirt fit?
- Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.879
I'll take care of this.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.190
As head Fishes,
we need to make a choice now.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.429
We need to choose leadership.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.398
TOMASZ: I don't think
that those bloodstains will wash off.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.189
Don't worry about it. Throw it away.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.594
- I'm in charge of watching you.
- Why?

32:50.960 --> 32:52.439
They told me.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.552
Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.237
I lived there once. Didn't like it.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.709
No.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.675
They kill you.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.671
- Where you from?
- Poland.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.993
Is this your place?

33:08.080 --> 33:10.435
My missus. She's a cod.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.518
- English Fish.
- MIRIAM: Mr Faron.

33:14.280 --> 33:18.512
Kee would like a word with you.
She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.354
I'll watch him.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.636
TOMASZ: Hey, don't smoke in the barn.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.670
EMILY: To Luke, our new leader. Luke.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.079
- To Luke.
- Luke.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.878
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

33:44.560 --> 33:46.357
I'll be right outside.

33:50.640 --> 33:54.918

They cut off their tits. They do.

(IMITATING SLICING)

33:56.480 --> 33:57.754
Gone. Bye.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.152
Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.356
It's wacko. Why not make machines
that suck eight titties?

34:06.080 --> 34:09.277
Is that what you want to talk about?
Cows and titties?

34:09.360 --> 34:11.237
Julian told me about your baby.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.192
Said his name was Dylan.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.554
You taught him to swim when he was two.
He called you "Papa."

34:18.320 --> 34:21.277
She said if anything goes spooky,
I should talk to you.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.237
Said you'd help me,
said you'd get me to the boat.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.072
- What boat?
- The <i>Tomorrow.</i>

34:26.159 --> 34:27.275
The <i>Tomorrow?</i>

34:28.120 --> 34:30.350
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.431
But I'm sure
your friends can take care of you.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.476
But Julian said only trust you.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.594
She said you'd help me.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.591
I don't know why she said that.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.755
Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.228
- You can't leave.
- Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.594
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

34:47.080 --> 34:49.310
What are you doing? Don't do that.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.319
I'm scared.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.313
Please help me.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.194
Jesus Christ.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.669
LUKE: Kee! Kee!
MIRIAM: What are you doing?

35:27.400 --> 35:30.915
- Are you all right?
- She wanted him to know. She has the right.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.873
Of course she has.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.429
For God's sake.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.159
When you're ready, come inside.
Everybody's arrived.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.312
- She's pregnant.
- Now you know what's at stake.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.589
- But she's pregnant.
- Yeah, I know.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.872
It's a miracle, isn't it?

35:55.200 --> 35:58.670
<i>Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor</i>

<i>All suspects should be considered armed</i>
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

36:15.840 --> 36:17.796
This was broadcast an hour ago.

36:17.880 --> 36:21.509
We have to assume it's just a matter of time
before they identify the rest of us,

36:21.600 --> 36:22.635
which includes you, Theo.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.199
WOMAN: Why is he here?
MAN: He's not a Fish.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.271
- He's not one of us.
- KEE: I want him here.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.112
LUKE: Kee wants him, he stays.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.590
Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our
brothers and sisters in the Human Project.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.796
- ALL: Right.
- Now we got to reevaluate that position.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.997
No, there's no need.
We move forward with the original plan.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.069
Yes!

36:38.160 --> 36:40.230
She'll never make it.
The police are looking for her.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.595
We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.033
We'd be risking the girl's life.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.475
Listen, listen! She belongs here.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.551
And this baby is the flag
that could unite us all!

36:48.640 --> 36:50.915
MIRIAM: We said we'd never use this baby
for political purposes.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.149
KEE: My baby's not a flag.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.719
Make it public!

36:54.120 --> 36:55.189
WOMAN: What?

36:55.400 --> 36:56.469
- What?
- What?

36:56.560 --> 36:57.549
Excuse me?

36:58.920 --> 37:00.558
You should make it public.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.795
You saw the telly.
She's about to be very public.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.075
THEO: It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

37:06.160 --> 37:10.790
Oh, right. And then the government will say,
"We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too."

37:10.880 --> 37:11.949
Well, whatever is going on,

37:12.040 --> 37:14.076
whatever your political ideas are,
it's irrelevant.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.479
- It doesn't matter.
- WOMAN: Come on.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.312
- She needs a doctor.
- MAN: You really don't get it.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.391
WOMAN 2: Look, the government
will take her baby

37:19.480 --> 37:21.391
and parade a posh black English lady
as the mother.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.357
- And she'll never see it again.
- KEE: Nobody's taking my baby!

37:23.440 --> 37:25.351
We all know this government
would never acknowledge

37:25.440 --> 37:27.351
the first human birth in 18 years
from a fugee.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.509
A wanted fugee.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.558
Why don't we explain to Mr Faron
what they do to immigrants in this country?

37:31.640 --> 37:34.518
MIRIAM: He knows. He's seen the cages.
He's not that stupid.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.079
KEE: I'm not going to the government.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.071
You told me
you would get me to the Human Project.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.434
- You promised me.
- I know.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.999
And we will.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.237
But I don't think it's safe
to try and reach the coast now.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.992
You could stay here, Kee.
It's a safe place for you to have your child.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.874
And when you and the baby
are well enough,

37:51.960 --> 37:54.110
we will find a way
to get you to the Human Project.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.189
I promise you, Kee.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.352
It could take months
to get back in touch with them again.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.677
This is true.
We have to take it under consideration.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.877
Kee, this is your decision.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.632
What do you think?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.150
- I think you need proper care.
- EMILY: Oh, brilliant!

38:14.240 --> 38:15.673
She has proper care!

38:15.760 --> 38:18.149

- Hang on. Kee?

38:19.080 --> 38:20.832
Kee, this is your choice.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.472
- I have my baby here...
- Yes!

38:25.560 --> 38:26.959
...then you get me to the Human Project.

We had no idea about the cops.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.631
You broke the protocol.
What were you thinking?

39:55.720 --> 39:56.994
What was I thinking?

39:57.080 --> 39:59.275
You could be responsible
for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.588
He needs a proper doctor!

40:00.680 --> 40:02.079
Don't you get it?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.229
We have a baby.

40:03.320 --> 40:06.517
When people see we have a baby,
everyone will join us in the Uprising.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.797
But we can forget about the baby
if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!

40:09.880 --> 40:11.154
What was I supposed to do?

40:11.240 --> 40:13.959
You saw how he is.
He's on death's fucking door!

Simon, right?

40:23.680 --> 40:25.910
- Aye, Simon.
- All right, sit down, Patric.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.150
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.630
Be proud to know that because
of the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.756
The baby will stay with us.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.679
No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then,
after we move the girl.

really fucking safe.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.629
Well, what do you suggest?

44:58.720 --> 45:01.029
Don't worry. I know where to go.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.714
Wait here.

45:29.800 --> 45:30.994
Oh, fuck.

46:49.280 --> 46:52.795
MIRIAM: The <i>Tomorrow</i> is a hospital ship
disguised as a fishing boat.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.359
They'll take us to the Human Project.

46:54.440 --> 46:57.477
I told you, <i>amigo,</i> the Human Project is real.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.835
Yeah, but you're also the guy
that believes in UFOs.

46:59.920 --> 47:02.514
Tell them about that thing
you saw on the heath.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.828
You saw a UFO?

47:05.280 --> 47:07.840
Did you know that the Human Project

47:07.920 --> 47:09.911
is supposed to have
a community on the Azores?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.753
It's a sanctuary.
That's where they'll take us, Kee.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.592
Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

47:14.680 --> 47:19.470
It's going to stop at the last two
weather buoys en route at sunset.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.348
So it will be tonight at Windsmore
and then two night's time at Bexhill.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.476
You can forget about Windsmore.
We'd never make it in time.

47:25.560 --> 47:27.391
No, it's our only chance.
We can't get to Bexhill.

47:27.480 --> 47:28.754
That's a refugee camp.

- Feed her for me, Theo.

I thought I catch the pest.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.995
But then my belly started getting big.

49:28.480 --> 49:32.598
Nobody ever told me these things.
I never seen a pregnant woman before.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.074
But I knew.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.632
I felt like a freak.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.712
I didn't tell nobody.

49:40.480 --> 49:44.155
I thought about the Quietus thing.
Supposed to be suave.

- Froley.

Name my baby Froley.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.960
It's the first baby in 18 years.

51:50.920 --> 51:52.433
Look, Julian and Theo.

51:52.520 --> 51:56.752
Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met
among a million protestors in a rally

51:56.840 --> 51:57.989
by chance.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.674
But they were there
because of what they believed in

52:00.760 --> 52:04.150
in the first place, their faith.
They wanted to change the world.

52:04.320 --> 52:06.880
And their faith kept them together.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.397
But by chance, Dylan was born.

52:10.720 --> 52:11.994
This is him?

52:12.320 --> 52:16.632
Yeah, that's him. He would have been
about your age. Magical child.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.874
Beautiful.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.069
- Their faith put in praxis.
- Praxis?

52:22.160 --> 52:24.230
- What happened?
- Chance.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.473
He was their sweet little dream.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.757
He had little hands, little legs, little feet.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.912
Little lungs.

52:33.560 --> 52:37.758
And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.552
And then, by chance,

52:42.200 --> 52:44.430
- he was gone.
- Oh, Jesus.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.760
You see, Theo's faith

52:49.560 --> 52:51.471
lost out to chance.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.875
So,

52:54.680 --> 52:58.992
why bother
if life's going to make its own choices?

52:59.320 --> 53:02.039
