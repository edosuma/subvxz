WEBVTT

00:04.542 --> 00:07.834
Uh-oh! Dad's here.
Donuts! Run for your lives!

00:10.834 --> 00:11.834
Up top.

00:12.834 --> 00:15.083
It's not funny anymore.
Dad's lost a bunch of weight.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.667
Thanks a lot, Dad. You got skinny
and killed all my best material.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.000
Actually, I've lost so much weight,

00:22.333 --> 00:24.583
I gotta start buying my clothes
in a regular store now.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.583
Oh, no more "Benny's Huge and Bald"?

00:29.291 --> 00:31.083
"Lenny's Big and Tall".

00:32.875 --> 00:34.166
But I love Lenny's.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.792
It's the only store
with steel-reinforced dressing rooms.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.792
All:

00:38.875 --> 00:43.291
The only store where the freight entrance
is also the main entrance.

00:43.375 --> 00:45.875
Okay, wait, wait. Okay, I got one.

00:45.959 --> 00:50.208
It's the only store where the large sizes
are big and the small ones...

00:51.417 --> 00:52.250
aren't.

00:55.375 --> 00:56.458
Yeah, I guess I don't got one.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.750
All right. I'm off to the Mall.

01:00.208 --> 01:03.583
Wow. Shopping without shame.
This is gonna be different.

01:05.375 --> 01:09.375
Hey, Dad. Just don't get a hairpiece.
I mean, you gotta leave me something.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.542
Where the big people are so fat...

01:14.625 --> 01:15.792
- PJ, we're done.

Teddy:

02:12.792 --> 02:15.041
Great news. Remember the play I wrote,

02:15.125 --> 02:16.500
- "The dancing Princess"?
- Yeah.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.583
My theater group is doing the production
and Ivy's directing.

02:19.667 --> 02:20.875
And I'm starring?

02:22.792 --> 02:25.792
- No.
- Oh. Then what's the great news?

02:26.458 --> 02:29.875
Well, you're not in this one, Mom,
but guess who is.

02:30.625 --> 02:31.792
Charlie!

02:31.875 --> 02:33.583
I'm gonna be a Princess.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.333
Good for you.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.458
Hope show business doesn't break
your heart as it did mine.

02:42.917 --> 02:44.959
Hey, Charlie.
Why is that bear still on the floor?

02:45.041 --> 02:46.875
I asked you to pick that up an hour ago.

02:48.959 --> 02:51.542
Hey, Princess.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.750
- Pick up the bear now.
- No.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.667
She's been like this all day.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.041
Mom. If I may...

02:59.333 --> 03:01.333
Hey, Charlie, sweetie.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.667
Could you pick up that bear
for your big sister, please?

03:04.750 --> 03:05.709
Okay.

03:14.709 --> 03:17.250
If you need her to do anything else,
just let me know.

03:18.125 --> 03:21.333
She's three years old. You got lucky.

03:21.417 --> 03:25.500
No, no. It's not luck.
Charlie and I have a special sister bond.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.333
I guess you could call me
"The Charlie Whisperer".

03:29.917 --> 03:32.500
"The Charlie Whisperer".

03:32.583 --> 03:34.041
Okay. Well, if you're so good,

03:34.125 --> 03:35.875
why don't you get her to come out
of your room?

03:43.250 --> 03:45.083
I did that one with my mind.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.083
- What you working on?
- Oh, it's for English.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.875
I have to write a report
about an old person.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.750
"My neighbor Bert. By Gabe Duncan".

04:05.583 --> 04:08.750
"Bert Doogan. Husband, Father,

04:08.834 --> 04:11.083
Astronaut"? Whoa!

04:11.834 --> 04:14.291
I didn't know grumpy old Bert
was an Astronaut.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.250
Neither does grumpy old Bert.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.208
I made the whole thing up.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.417
It was either that or actually talking
to the old dude.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.959
"Whenever I mow Bert's lawn,

04:28.041 --> 04:30.542
he tells me stories
about his adventures in space.

04:30.834 --> 04:33.875
There was this one time where
his rocket sprung a leak and he fixed it,

04:33.959 --> 04:36.000
with toothpaste and moon rocks".

04:37.250 --> 04:38.375
Come on, dude!

04:38.458 --> 04:39.500
No one's gonna believe that.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.000
- What, the moon rocks?
- No, that you mowed somebody's lawn.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.041
Oh!

04:48.875 --> 04:53.208
- Oh, there's my favorite playwright.
- There's my favorite Director!

04:53.291 --> 04:54.291
- Ah!
- Hey!

04:54.375 --> 04:57.375
This is so exciting.
I didn't even know you wanted to direct.

04:57.458 --> 05:01.542
Are you kidding? I talk loud,
I like to boss people around...

05:01.625 --> 05:02.625
I'm a natural.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.583
- Now let's talk casting.
- Yes!

05:07.166 --> 05:08.333
Okay.

05:08.417 --> 05:12.166
Well, uh, at least we know
who's gonna play the young Princess...

05:12.250 --> 05:15.291
- Charlie.
- Whoa. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.625
Charlie's got to audition
like everybody else.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.000
Okay, I get it.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.917
You want me to bring Charlie in
for an "audition."

05:25.709 --> 05:27.750
Yes, I "do."

05:29.500 --> 05:32.208
Ivy, look. It's just one line
and I wrote it for Charlie.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.166
And if she can say it, she gets the part.

05:37.333 --> 05:38.291
Hello.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.208
Mrs. Duncan, please stop calling me.
You cannot be in the play.

05:55.625 --> 05:56.750
Hey, guys.

06:02.250 --> 06:03.417
What was that?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Uh, Bob, honey?
Could you come out here please?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.208
Whatcha wearing?

06:19.750 --> 06:20.750
What, this?

06:21.083 --> 06:22.375
Got it at the Mall.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.500
Yeah, some regular store. Whatever.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.041
Oh, the place was called "Cloz",
with a "Z".

06:30.208 --> 06:32.417
Cloz? I shop there.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.208
At least I used to.

06:37.375 --> 06:40.750
Ooh, question about this "Cloz"
with a "Z"...

06:40.834 --> 06:44.166
Um, do they have mirrors or lights?

06:45.875 --> 06:48.333
All right, all right. All right, fine.
I know what you're thinking.

06:48.417 --> 06:51.834
Hey, at first, I wasn't sure about
this new look either. But you know what?

06:51.917 --> 06:53.667
Everybody kept complimenting me.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.041
- Really?
- Yeah, they said I was "making it work".

07:00.166 --> 07:01.458
"Rockin' that outfit".

07:02.417 --> 07:04.917
Oh, yeah, "Killin' those jeans".

07:06.875 --> 07:09.041
Not sure that last one was a compliment.

07:15.709 --> 07:17.709
And those are the kind
of uplifting stories

07:17.792 --> 07:22.041
my neighbor Bert tells me
whenever my brother PJ mows his lawn.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.959
Gabe, that was wonderful. Thank you.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.834
No, thank you
for giving me the assignment.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.917
You know,
Bert sounds like an incredible man.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.208
Do you think he could come in
and speak to the class?

07:40.792 --> 07:42.583
Um... you know...

07:42.917 --> 07:46.792
I don't think that's a good idea.
He's not moving around very well anymore.

07:47.250 --> 07:50.417
Astronauting is very hard on the knees.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.375
Well, if you bring him in,
I'll give you extra credit.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.000
And it could bring your grade
up to an "A".

07:56.083 --> 07:58.583
Huh. An "A" in English.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.792
Woo! Can't ask for more better than that.

08:08.709 --> 08:09.709
Next!

08:10.125 --> 08:16.041
Okay. For the role of the young Princess,
presenting Charlie Duncan.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.083
Hi, Charlie.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.417
Okay, Charlie, say the line.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.375
Charlie, hey.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.250
Charlie, remember, your line is,

08:27.333 --> 08:30.166
"Your majesty, I was born to dance".

08:30.500 --> 08:31.792
Okay? Now you say it.

08:32.709 --> 08:34.625
I turned my ears off.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.542
Here, just-- Can you give us a minute?

08:38.625 --> 08:39.583
Okay.

08:41.417 --> 08:42.542
Who's next?

08:44.750 --> 08:46.250
Hi, I'm Tammy.

08:46.583 --> 08:47.917
Hi, Tammy. Whenever you're ready.

08:50.667 --> 08:55.125
Your majesty, I was born to dance.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.834
Tammy, that was very good.

09:12.208 --> 09:14.250
Wow. What did you think?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.333
A little show-offy for my taste.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.917
Oh, come on! She's fantastic.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.500
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah sure,
she can act and dance and say the line,

09:24.583 --> 09:28.250
but once you take that away,
then what do you have?

09:29.792 --> 09:30.792
Charlie.

09:37.792 --> 09:38.792
Okay.

09:38.875 --> 09:42.458
We have got two great candidates
for the role of the young Princess.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.000
Let's just compare them objectively.

09:45.709 --> 09:49.083
Charlie versus Hammy.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.000
Tammy.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.959
Oh, it's too late.
I already wrote "Hammy".

09:57.000 --> 10:00.250
Okay! First category, cuteness.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.250
Well, Charlie gets a 10.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.417
No, no question there.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.667
And, uh, Tammy...

10:07.375 --> 10:09.000
let's be generous and give her a five.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.291
A five?

10:11.375 --> 10:13.375
Is that too high? I'll make it a four.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.959
Okay, next category, personality.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.208
- Tammy has a nice smile.
- With dead shark eyes.

10:23.125 --> 10:26.208
I'll make it another four.
Charlie gets a 10.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.500
How about the ability to say lines?

10:29.875 --> 10:33.583
Oh. Yeah. There is some, uh--
There is some debate there.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.166
You know what?
Let's just give them each a five.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.125
Okay.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.375
And there you have it!
Charlie is the clear-cut winner!

10:43.709 --> 10:45.417
Oh, Teddy! Come on!

10:45.500 --> 10:48.417
But the numbers don't lie.
I didn't just make them up.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.834
Yes, you did!

10:51.542 --> 10:53.709
Ivy, I will get her to say the line.

10:54.417 --> 10:56.458
I'm The Charlie Whisperer.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.709
All right. She's got the part.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.875
I don't know how I'm gonna explain this
to Tammy.

11:02.959 --> 11:05.083
Don't worry about Tammy.
She's gonna get tons of parts.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.333
She's amazing.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.375
- Ooh, cookies.
- Hey, they're not for you.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.125
- They're for Bert.
- Bert's coming over?

11:18.208 --> 11:21.125
Yeah, and can you stick around?
You have a way with old people.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.792
Usually, it creeps me out,
but now I need you.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.959
Hey! Bert! Come on in.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.792
I've been living across the street
from you people for 20 years

11:38.875 --> 11:40.959
and I've never been invited over.

11:42.959 --> 11:44.125
We're shy.

11:45.083 --> 11:49.834
Shy? I hear that mother of yours
singing and dancing all the time!

11:50.875 --> 11:54.083
- Women, huh, Bert?
- Hey, tell me about it.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.792
- Cookie?
- Yeah, sure.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.625
That is a nice cardigan.

12:00.041 --> 12:01.458
They don't make them like that anymore.

12:02.917 --> 12:05.250
You got that right.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.834
Now you, I like.

12:08.208 --> 12:11.333
Anyhoo, Bert. I was wondering
if you could come to my class

12:11.417 --> 12:13.333
and talk about your amazing career.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.834
- Amazing? I was a Mailman.
- Oh!

12:18.625 --> 12:20.667
Good stuff. Good stuff.

12:20.750 --> 12:25.250
But let me just suggest one small--
A little tiny tweak.

12:25.625 --> 12:28.917
Instead of Mailman,
let's use a different word.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.709
Letter carrier?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.291
I was thinking Astronaut.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.792
You want me to lie?
What's wrong with being a Mailman?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.375
Nothing.
It's just that the kids these days,

12:41.458 --> 12:42.792
they're not as easily entertained.

12:43.625 --> 12:47.000
What with the video games,
the gizmos and the gadgets.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.875
We're losing our country, Bert.

12:51.709 --> 12:54.875
That's what I always say
when I'm talking to my radio.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.250
So, so you'll do it?

12:58.333 --> 13:00.750
No! I'm not gonna lie about my job.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.125
What will you lie about?

13:03.709 --> 13:04.667
Your vacations?

13:04.750 --> 13:07.250
And could one of them possibly
have been to Jupiter?

13:09.166 --> 13:11.083
Are you off your nut?

13:11.166 --> 13:12.917
Who raised you anyway?

13:17.375 --> 13:18.542
Hey, Bert.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.458
Okay, it's not your fault.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.041
Charlie, it's just one line.

13:35.333 --> 13:40.875
Say it with me.
"Your majesty, I was born to dance".

13:44.667 --> 13:46.709
Charlie, come on, please.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.625
Hey, girls. What's going on?

13:48.709 --> 13:51.000
I can't get Charlie to say her line.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.417
Why don't you just do it with your mind?

13:56.125 --> 13:58.500
If you're done mocking me,
I could really use your help here.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.125
Oh, sweetheart.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.667
I'll never be done mocking you.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.959
Okay, relax. I have an idea.

14:08.041 --> 14:11.792
Okay, Charlie.
We're gonna read a fun new book.

14:12.333 --> 14:18.083
It's called "Your majesty,
I was born to dance".

14:19.583 --> 14:23.375
Ohh! That sounds like a great title.
You wanna say that?

14:23.792 --> 14:26.959
Yeah, do you wanna say it
like the Princess in the book?

14:27.041 --> 14:28.458
That's a dog.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.083
Well, it's a doggy Princess
with an invisible tiara.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.458
I want another book.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.750
Come on, Charlie. You can say the line.

14:43.417 --> 14:46.166
"Your majesty, I was born to dance".

14:46.542 --> 14:49.542
"Your majesty, I was born to dance".

14:49.625 --> 14:51.333
Oh!

14:51.417 --> 14:53.083
Who's the Charlie Whisperer now?

14:58.291 --> 15:01.709
All right, here he is,
Bert Doogan, famous Astronaut.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.959
Well, Bert.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.333
Thank you so much for joining us.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.291
Why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourself?

15:24.709 --> 15:26.667
Could Bert take off his helmet?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.583
Uh, no. Next question.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.500
So, we have a speaker who
can't actually speak?

15:34.959 --> 15:38.500
Okay, kids. Let's all line-up
and we can all touch Bert's helmet,

15:38.583 --> 15:40.000
and then he'll be on his way.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.250
I'll go first.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.583
Gabe, who is this?

15:46.667 --> 15:48.166
It's Bert, my neighbor.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.166
Bert looks surprisingly young.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.250
Oh, thank you, dear.
That's sweet of you to say.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.208
Gabe, I want the truth.

15:55.291 --> 15:58.709
Okay. The truth is that--

16:00.542 --> 16:04.000
On his last mission, Bert went through
a wormhole sending him back in time.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.625
Gabe Duncan, I should have known better.

16:10.083 --> 16:13.959
- You know, you really should have.
- Well, I should get going.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.875
To infinity and beyond!

16:29.458 --> 16:30.458
Oh, hey, hon'.

16:30.542 --> 16:33.959
Hey! There's my baby boy.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.125
Um, Bob, hon', you--

16:37.500 --> 16:40.458
- You missing something?
- Wha-- Oh! This?

16:40.875 --> 16:43.125
Aw, I just decided to update
the work threads.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.875
Well, sweetie.

16:44.959 --> 16:48.125
You're an exterminator.
Isn't the point of your uniform

16:48.208 --> 16:51.208
to protect you from things
that sting and bite?

16:51.834 --> 16:55.458
Hey, these cannons are my protection.

16:59.458 --> 17:00.375
Oh.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.208
Daddy's gone crazy.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.250
Mama's gonna fix it.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.041
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

17:15.125 --> 17:16.125
Teddy:

17:16.208 --> 17:18.208
- And where's Charlie?
- She's at home.

17:18.291 --> 17:21.041
- What?
- She refused to come.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.875
And then when I asked her nicely,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.500
she turned off her ears
and she ran away from me.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.166
How could you do this to me?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.917
Look, it's not completely my fault.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.875
Okay? A good Director
would have chosen Tammy!

17:36.375 --> 17:38.166
Teddy, the--

17:38.250 --> 17:40.834
The young Princess goes on in two minutes.
What are we gonna do?

17:41.667 --> 17:44.166
I'll take care of it.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.166
Your majesty, I was born to dance!

18:16.250 --> 18:17.875
Hey. What's going on?

18:18.834 --> 18:20.875
Vern, what are you doing here?

18:21.333 --> 18:22.917
I'm here because I love you, man.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.375
Uh-oh.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.083
Bob, honey. Come here.
Have a seat next to me.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.000
Bob:

18:35.083 --> 18:37.458
Now, sweetie, we have some things
we'd like to say,

18:37.542 --> 18:39.417
so please just hear us out.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.542
Teddy? You start.

18:41.625 --> 18:45.458
Dad, I miss the old you.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.750
You know, the normal guy
whose clothes aren't tighter than mine.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.834
Okay. PJ.

18:55.625 --> 18:56.500
Dad...

18:57.709 --> 18:59.709
I want us to shop at different stores.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.625
I don't want us to have the same pants.

19:06.125 --> 19:10.834
For the record, I love your new look!
It's a comedic gold mine.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.834
- For instance--
- Uh, uh, thank you, Gabe.

19:16.792 --> 19:19.125
Vern? Would you like to share?

19:20.709 --> 19:21.750
Look at me, boss.

19:23.083 --> 19:28.375
I had to expose my flesh to the enemy
just so you could show off your guns.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.583
What's going on, Bob?

19:32.875 --> 19:35.125
Are you having some sort
of a mid-life crisis?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.250
No!

19:39.834 --> 19:41.417
I--

19:42.500 --> 19:43.583
All right.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.583
A couple of months ago,
I'm in the park with Toby

19:47.333 --> 19:49.959
and, uh...

19:50.041 --> 19:52.834
somebody thought I was his grandfather.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.125
So you went through all of this

19:55.208 --> 19:57.583
because of some off-handed comment
from a stranger?

19:57.667 --> 19:58.542
Yeah!

19:59.458 --> 20:03.166
But it-- Guys, it inspired me
to lose weight, get in shape.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.917
And your new body is great.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.750
What you've chosen
to put on your new body...

20:09.834 --> 20:11.166
not so great.

20:12.959 --> 20:13.834
Dad.

20:15.166 --> 20:18.375
Will you accept our help
and return those clothes today?

20:18.834 --> 20:23.250
There's a car waiting outside to take
you to an age-appropriate store.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.166
All right, fine. I'll go.

20:27.750 --> 20:31.125
But, you're gonna have to give me
20 minutes to get out of these pants.

20:41.667 --> 20:42.917
Well, Charlie.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.917
Dad returned all the clothes,
so there's one less teenager in the house.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.709
- And in other news--
- Bert: Hey! Keep it down in there!

20:51.417 --> 20:53.291
Gabe got in trouble at school,

20:53.375 --> 20:55.375
so now he has to interview
our neighbor Bert for real.

20:55.458 --> 20:56.625
Now where was I?

20:57.333 --> 20:58.792
1983.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.041
1983.

21:02.125 --> 21:05.250
The first-class stamp cost 20 cents.

21:05.375 --> 21:08.333
And the zip plus-four code
was established.

21:08.583 --> 21:11.000
Now the Z.P.4. Code,

21:11.083 --> 21:14.083
was originally supposed to be
just a Z.P.3.

21:14.166 --> 21:17.333
Now this is where it gets complicated,
so just stay with me.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.250
It looks like Gabe's
gonna be there a while.

21:21.458 --> 21:22.750
Wish him good luck, Charlie.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.208
All right, Vern.
You wanna look good in that uniform,

21:29.291 --> 21:30.583
we gotta get you into shape.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.458
All right.

21:33.917 --> 21:38.583
Now before we begin,
we need to stretch out.

21:39.542 --> 21:40.667
You are limber!

21:41.083 --> 21:42.667
All right, let's try some sit-ups.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.250
Now watch my technique.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.083
All right, your turn.

21:55.917 --> 21:58.250
Vern? You okay?

21:58.417 --> 22:01.542
I think I did a little bit
too much too fast, boss.
