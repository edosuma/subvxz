WEBVTT

00:08.809 --> 00:11.045
DON:
You killed eight people.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.815
You double-crossed
your partners.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.518
You killed them
when things went bad.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.189
You lied to me the
first time we met.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.091
You haven't
stopped since.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.361
That's all going
to end right now.

00:30.331 --> 00:33.467
McGOWAN: Just as we've sworn to
uphold all the laws,

00:33.501 --> 00:36.137
we don't get to choose
which rules we obey.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.438
CHARLIE:
"Crito, we owe a rooster

00:37.471 --> 00:39.207
"to Asclepius.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.809
Please don't forget
to pay the debt."

00:43.177 --> 00:44.778
How does 20 years sound?

00:44.812 --> 00:46.180
Thirty?

00:46.214 --> 00:47.615
Life?

00:48.716 --> 00:49.750
I have the warrant.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.152
Let's do this right.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.253
We don't want her walking.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.421
Don't worry, she's not walking.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.357
DON:
You know, I hear

00:56.390 --> 00:59.127
that sodium thiopental is cold
when it goes in your veins.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.294
You look forward to that.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.831
Wait a minute.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.335
Just let me go.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.804
(explosion)

01:21.182 --> 01:23.217
McGOWAN:
Back in the '70s,

01:23.251 --> 01:25.353
when I started out
in the Bureau,

01:25.386 --> 01:26.754
there weren't a lot

01:26.787 --> 01:28.856
of your kind
of agents around.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.125
You mean black.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.894
I mean leaders.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.596
Post-Vietnam,
law enforcement

01:35.629 --> 01:37.665
wasn't all that popular
a vocation.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.300
I read your file.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.535
I've seen the way you operate.

01:41.569 --> 01:45.173
You're the future of this
department, Agent Sinclair.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.275
I appreciate that.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.210
One day,
when you've had the benefit

01:49.243 --> 01:51.445
of sitting in that chair
as long as I have,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.447
you'll understand

01:53.481 --> 01:55.183
that the department
is a lot bigger

01:55.216 --> 01:57.318
than any case
or individual.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.719
You swore an oath to the FBI...

01:58.752 --> 02:00.321
not Don Eppes.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.855
I'm well aware of
my responsibilities.

02:01.889 --> 02:02.990
Did Professor Eppes

02:03.023 --> 02:06.894
act on his own, or was he
led astray by his brother?

02:08.796 --> 02:13.567
Listen, nobody leads
Charlie Eppes anywhere, okay,

02:13.601 --> 02:14.568
least of all Don.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.537
So they have a bad relationship?

02:16.570 --> 02:19.273
They're brothers, so there's
a little bit of arguing

02:19.307 --> 02:22.876
and a lot of success, but
Charlie is his own man.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.545
And if Don failed to stop him,

02:24.578 --> 02:26.247
then you're saying
it was Professor Eppes' idea

02:26.280 --> 02:27.648
to begin with.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.418
I'm not saying
anything.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.186
(engine roaring)

02:32.220 --> 02:33.254
Again.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.967
Okay, that's it.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.968
(Charlie chuckling)

02:48.001 --> 02:49.169
Yeah!

02:50.238 --> 02:53.207
Hey, well done,
Charles.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.508
Thank you, thank you,

02:54.542 --> 02:55.909
but we wouldn't
have been successful

02:55.943 --> 02:56.977
without your aerodynamics work.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.613
You know, it is very cool
that the Aprilia MotoGP

02:59.647 --> 03:00.981
asked for your help
with this.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.616
It is very cool.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.318
But before you pop
the champagne,

03:04.352 --> 03:06.387
you do realize that this
only improved the air flow

03:06.420 --> 03:07.788
by 1/1000 of a second.

03:07.821 --> 03:08.989
Yeah, but, you know,
in the world

03:09.022 --> 03:11.392
of grand prix motorcycle racing,
that means the difference

03:11.425 --> 03:13.227
between a first
and second place finish.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.795
Or the time it takes
light to travel

03:14.828 --> 03:16.464
from Milwaukee to Chicago
and back

03:16.497 --> 03:17.831
or the ruby-throated hummingbird

03:17.865 --> 03:19.833
to flap its wings once
or even...

03:19.867 --> 03:21.802
I'm sure you could go on
all day.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.204
Team Eppes, time
for a pit stop.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.908
Hello?

03:27.941 --> 03:28.976
Okay.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.344
Yeah, I'll be
right over.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.246
I got to go.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.348
Hey.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.284
Clearance or no clearance,
he still knows how

03:36.317 --> 03:37.318
to make an exit.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.590
DON:
Did you get

03:42.623 --> 03:43.657
a good jury or something?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.725
Better.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.294
What's up?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.828
What do you say
to a weekend

03:47.861 --> 03:49.930
at the St. Regis
New York City,

03:49.963 --> 03:53.401
first class,
all expenses paid?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.502
Yeah, I like it.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.870
Skadden Arps law firm
has been following my work,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.839
and they want
to interview me for a job.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.841
They said I could
bring a friend.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.777
Don, LAPD has eight dead
in a coffee shop, Mid-Wilshire.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.379
What, they're
asking for us?

04:05.413 --> 04:06.447
Yeah, joint
investigation.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.715
It's a mass murder.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.016
Their lab's
already overstretched.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.351
Going to need our help.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.352
Well, let's just, uh...

04:11.385 --> 04:13.253
we'll talk about
it later, okay?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.591
Hey, how you doing?

04:17.625 --> 04:18.992
(siren wailing)

04:19.026 --> 04:20.928
(sighs):
What do you say, Colby?

04:20.961 --> 04:22.463
Looks like Fallujah
in there.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.797
We got eight dead,
five with shots

04:23.831 --> 04:25.599
to the back of the head
execution style.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.800
Any kind of motive?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.636
Boys in blue are
saying robbery.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.338
If this was a robbery,

04:30.371 --> 04:32.606
it's the dumbest crew
I've ever seen.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.575
What kind of robbers
leave $500 behind?

04:37.578 --> 04:38.646
Jerry Lowe.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.314
LAPD, off-duty.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.384
Stops here a couple times
a week on his way home.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.985
- You know him?
- No, but when I

04:45.018 --> 04:46.520
worked Narco
out of Rampart,

04:46.554 --> 04:47.555
he was a
patrol team leader.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.889
That gun's unsnapped.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.558
COLBY:
Must have gone for it

04:50.591 --> 04:52.593
and not been
quick enough.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.529
Ryder, on the other hand,
made a play,

04:55.563 --> 04:57.965
but knives don't
deflect bullets.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.967
What about this guy here?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.502
No money,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.604
no I.D., no idea.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.606
COLBY: Maybe he followed the
cook's lead,

05:05.639 --> 05:06.574
tried to be a hero.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.646
Five people
were brought back here

05:12.680 --> 05:14.348
and executed.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.849
What's with
the gold watch?

05:15.883 --> 05:17.050
Why didn't they grab that?

05:17.084 --> 05:18.652
Rolex.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.054
They didn't go
for the cash or the gold.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.023
All right.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.128
Jon Schmidt, Robbery Homicide.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.363
Don Eppes.
I'm glad

05:29.397 --> 05:30.598
to see you
guys are here.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.832
We could really
use the assist.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.467
Jerry Lowe worked for me

05:33.501 --> 05:34.468
over at Intel Division.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.536
Now, he was a good man.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.037
He did not deserve this.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.939
CHARLIE: I have clearance to be
here.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.041
What the hell's going on?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.142
He's with us.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.011
I'm working for the LAPD.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.582
(murmuring,
garbled radio chatter)

05:48.616 --> 05:50.150
LAPD heard about
my suspension,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.785
and they said all
I needed to do

05:51.819 --> 05:52.953
was pass a
polygraph exam.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.122
What, you don't tell me?

05:55.155 --> 05:58.158
I... I didn't think
they'd need me so soon.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.094
The lab rats say they're gonna
need time that we don't have

06:01.128 --> 06:03.096
to unscramble the mess in there.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.433
All right, well,
let... let's see.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.700
Um, would it
help to know

06:06.734 --> 06:08.769
where everyone was seated?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.571
Because that's a simple
question of aggregation.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.672
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.042
During lunch at any typical
high school cafeteria,

06:15.075 --> 06:16.176
each student looks for a seat,

06:16.209 --> 06:18.879
but students aren't always free
to sit where they want.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.081
It's dictated
by the first group to enter.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.984
So, let's say the cheerleaders
enter first.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.186
Next come the jocks.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.757
Naturally, the jocks want
to be near the cheerleaders.

06:29.790 --> 06:34.161
The next group to enter
are the mathematicians.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.064
The mathematicians want to be
as far away from the jocks

06:37.097 --> 06:40.501
as possible, so that no one
gets picked on.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.902
And it's the same thing here.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.771
You know, a truck driver
who's used to being alone

06:43.804 --> 06:44.938
is gonna sit at the counter.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.173
An elderly lady is gonna sit

06:46.206 --> 06:47.508
far away from
the jukebox.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.876
A young couple in a booth.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.144
Right, exactly, and
an aggregation model

06:51.178 --> 06:53.146
filters through the
characteristics

06:53.180 --> 06:55.449
of the victims and searches

06:55.483 --> 06:56.950
for their strongest
attributes to determine

06:56.984 --> 06:58.786
their most likely
choice of seat.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.753
DON:
What's up?

06:59.787 --> 07:02.055
Boss wants you to go
interview a Kurt Young.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.491
SCHMIDT: The guy who
runs Zenith Studios?

07:03.524 --> 07:05.559
Yeah, he's got Brangelina
on speed dial.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.828
DAVID: Apparently, it has to do
with this case.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.797
You were supposed to be
there five minutes ago.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.601
(murmuring, bell ringing)

07:13.634 --> 07:15.736
I understand an
LAPD detective,

07:15.769 --> 07:18.672
Jerry Lowe, was
killed this morning.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.940
Yeah, that's interesting,

07:19.973 --> 07:21.575
'cause the names
haven't been released yet.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.944
I don't wait for the news
to get my information.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.179
Oh?

07:27.848 --> 07:31.251
Lowe was blackmailing me
for the last two years.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.720
He worked in Intelligence.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.922
He spied on people
for the LAPD.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.557
- What did he have on you?
- Enough.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.692
Enough to keep me
from going to the FBI.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.495
Nothing illegal...

07:41.529 --> 07:45.265
but considerably
embarrassing.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.068
You think I look into him,
I'm gonna find that file?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.603
I never forget favors.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.204
(chuckles):
I don't need any favors.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.674
Everyone needs
favors, Agent Eppes.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.777
Consider how quickly
your boss sent you here.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.219
DAVID: You still think Lowe is
the flash point.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.788
NIKKI:
And if Young

08:07.821 --> 08:09.623
had reason to want Lowe dead,

08:09.657 --> 08:11.625
maybe he hires someone
to whack him.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.293
You know, Lowe fought back.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.863
Chain reaction
put eight stiffs in the morgue.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.165
Finished a time line
for Jesse Martinez,

08:18.198 --> 08:19.933
taxi driver.

08:19.967 --> 08:23.103
Jerry Lowe
left two kids behind.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.706
The waitress, Renee Collins...

08:25.739 --> 08:27.675
she left four.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.176
Single parent mom.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.145
The cook, Ryder, lived
with his old man.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.781
He's in a wheelchair,
totally dependant

08:33.814 --> 08:35.816
on his son's
steady paycheck.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.285
I know that Lowe was a cop,
but that doesn't make him

08:38.318 --> 08:40.888
any more special
than the rest.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.891
In LAPD... you kill a cop,

08:43.924 --> 08:45.258
that's a priority.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.829
In the FBI,
if you kill eight people,

08:48.862 --> 08:50.197
they're all a priority.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.675
You know, the LAPD
is a fascinating organization.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.877
You know, they invented SWAT.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.013
They invented
community policing,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.314
the D.A.R.E. program.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.782
Not to mention
Joe Friday.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.984
Oh, yeah, he's
from Dragnet, right?

09:11.018 --> 09:13.754
CHARLIE: Yeah, and you know,
his badge number, 714...

09:13.787 --> 09:15.923
it's been retired--
no officer can wear it.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.691
That's odd, that's
the same number

09:17.725 --> 09:19.827
stamped on U.S.-made
Quaalude tablets.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.132
It's not really relevant
how I know that.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.034
(Charlie and Amita chuckling)

09:27.067 --> 09:27.901
What's up?

09:27.935 --> 09:30.270
It's just nice
to see you happy again.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.805
The Eppes spark is back.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.340
I have my very own spark now?

09:33.373 --> 09:34.441
Most definitely.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.344
Actually, it's more like
a rearranging of molecules.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.179
Hey, speaking of
rearranging molecules,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.615
you see where Professor
Eric Kolokoff has designed

09:41.649 --> 09:45.118
a new kind of graphene-based
digital paper?

09:45.152 --> 09:49.657
Yeah, apparently it's flexible,
just like authentic parchment.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.892
Think of the trees
that will save.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.893
(beeping)

09:52.926 --> 09:53.894
I'm sorry.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.763
Oh, it's okay,
it happens.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.298
Professor Eppes, it seems
you have some results.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.668
All right,
I'll go call Don.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.637
Uh, you mean Schmidt.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.872
Right.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.074
ROBIN:
So, Jerry Lowe was blackmailing

10:07.107 --> 10:08.408
the head of Zenith Studios.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.343
That makes Young
suspect number one by default.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.411
Let me ask you
something.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.946
You know anything about LAPD's

10:12.980 --> 10:14.081
Intelligence Division?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.983
It's like their answer
to the CIA.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.384
Became prominent in the '60s,

10:17.417 --> 10:18.852
infiltrating
radical groups.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.353
Some people
would say they

10:20.387 --> 10:21.288
got carried away.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.692
It was a big scandal
a couple years back.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.827
Officers were getting files
on prominent officials,

10:26.860 --> 10:28.028
celebrities.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.097
So what, it's just like
J. Edgar used to do.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.233
The judge is signing
the warrants

10:33.266 --> 10:35.969
for Lowe's bank accounts,
so we should know soon enough

10:36.003 --> 10:38.005
whether Young
is telling the truth.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.207
Okay.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.975
So I guess you
are pretty busy, huh?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.877
Yeah.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.414
You know, I can push
the trip off a week or two.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.717
I'm sure the law firm
wouldn't mind.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.686
Ah, you know something else
is probably gonna pop up.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.291
I need to go check
on those warrants.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.730
CHARLIE:
Using an aggregation model,

11:02.763 --> 11:05.999
we can see where each victim
was located.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.468
Wow.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.338
No offense, Charlie,
but I'm glad the FBI

11:11.371 --> 11:12.706
suspended you.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.041
Except there's only
seven bodies here.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.208
There's supposed
to be eight.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.779
That's because
victim number three,

11:18.812 --> 11:19.880
Benito Alvarez,

11:19.913 --> 11:20.881
didn't fit in anywhere.

11:20.914 --> 11:21.949
NIKKI:
What do you mean

11:21.982 --> 11:23.283
he doesn't fit in?

11:23.316 --> 11:25.052
Think of a high school
cafeteria.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.921
Each student is seated
in their respective seats,

11:27.955 --> 11:29.990
when a new student comes in.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.225
Now, he hasn't established
a circle of friends yet,

11:32.259 --> 11:34.127
so he's not quite sure
where to sit.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.397
Number three was on the move.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.767
Exactly.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.234
Benito Alvarez.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.736
Man of the hour.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.905
Lab found gunshot residue
all over his hand.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.473
How much?

11:46.506 --> 11:47.340
Enough to shoot seven people.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.442
Okay, well, if Alvarez
was the shooter,

11:49.476 --> 11:51.311
then what happened
to his gun?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.113
And who killed him?

12:01.321 --> 12:06.193
Benito Alvarez scrubbed out
of LAPD Academy after ten weeks.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.228
- He failed a drug test?
- Yeah, so he moves

12:08.261 --> 12:10.397
to his next best career choice,
scumbag for rent.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.099
And he's the guy
that Young hires

12:12.132 --> 12:13.767
to 86 Lowe.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.903
So, what, he commits suicide
'cause he's guilty?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.505
And then, what,
his gun just walks out the door?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.810
What year does it say
he washed out?

12:22.843 --> 12:25.045
1992.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.915
The year that Lowe graduated.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.249
They were classmates.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.252
A 16-year vet
and a guy who failed a pee test

12:32.285 --> 12:34.387
drink coffee
and watch the sun rise together?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.123
I mean, that make sense to you?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.325
What if he was snitching
for Lowe?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.896
What time did you say
that 911 call came in?

12:42.930 --> 12:46.133
Um, lady walking by with
her dog heard gunshots.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.169
Dispatch got the
call at 5:30.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.171
All right,
'cause Lowe, our cop--

12:51.204 --> 12:53.807
he made four phone calls
to the exact same number.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.142
First one at 0520,

12:55.175 --> 12:57.577
and the last one at 0528.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.479
Must have done it while Alvarez

12:59.512 --> 13:01.281
wasn't looking.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.883
You unsnap your gun,

13:02.916 --> 13:04.885
expecting to get in a gunfight,

13:04.918 --> 13:07.020
and you don't
call the cops?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.588
(beep and trilling)

13:08.621 --> 13:10.157
You called Lynn Potter,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.992
Marina Del Rey?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.793
(knocking)

13:15.896 --> 13:17.030
Agents Granger and Sinclair.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.232
Have I done something wrong?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.834
Don't know yet.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.370
Well, why don't you come in
and let's find out?

13:28.275 --> 13:30.077
COLBY:
So, you know a police officer

13:30.110 --> 13:31.144
named Jerry Lowe?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.212
LYNN:
Obviously,

13:32.245 --> 13:33.847
you know I do,

13:33.881 --> 13:35.248
but I didn't kill eight people,

13:35.282 --> 13:37.017
if that's what
you're asking.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.853
Lowe called you four times
before he was killed.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.521
I didn't get any messages.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.523
Where were you
5:00 a.m. yesterday morning?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.525
Passed out on the couch.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.128
I fell asleep watching
L.A. Confidential.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.429
Lowe and I met

13:49.462 --> 13:51.531
last year, had a little thing.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.034
COLBY: Well, it must have been
more than just

13:54.067 --> 13:55.969
a little thing
for him to call you

13:56.003 --> 13:56.970
instead of 911.

13:57.004 --> 13:57.938
You're telling me,
four calls,

13:57.971 --> 13:59.606
you didn't hear one of them?

13:59.639 --> 14:00.540
My cell phone was off.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.510
I only turn it on
when I need something.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.484
Here you go.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.886
I had 'em lighten
the action.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.521
Tell me how that feels.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.989
(click)

14:16.023 --> 14:17.257
Yeah.
Yeah?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.525
Yeah, that's good.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.630
Why didn't you tell me you
were looking for another job?

14:23.663 --> 14:24.965
I haven't decided anything.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.166
I'm just exploring
my possibilities.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.035
My father didn't
pay my way

14:28.068 --> 14:31.038
through Harvard
so I could make 70 grand a year.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.006
Yeah. It's a great opportunity.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.144
I just, um...

14:40.447 --> 14:42.549
I'm listening.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.917
I'm just not, you know...

14:43.951 --> 14:45.652
(door opens)

14:45.685 --> 14:47.320
NIKKI:
Preliminary ballistics.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.389
All victims were shot
with 9mm rounds.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.290
Same gun?

14:50.323 --> 14:52.625
We don't know yet,
but ERT found these.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.531
All stamped
law enforcement only.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.634
I thought
Lowe didn't fire his gun.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.170
DON:
He didn't.

15:03.203 --> 15:03.736
Alvarez did.

15:03.770 --> 15:04.938
Well, why is he carrying

15:04.972 --> 15:08.508
law enforcement ammunition
if Alvarez isn't a cop anymore?

15:08.541 --> 15:12.145
You didn't forget to tell us
anything about Alvarez?

15:12.179 --> 15:14.181
Like he's still on LAPD payroll?

15:14.214 --> 15:18.018
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
tell you guys that earlier.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.154
Alvarez worked deep cover for me
over at Intelligence, all right?

15:21.188 --> 15:24.591
Now, after we disbanded, he was
just rolled over into Narcotics.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.326
The chief only just
authorized me

15:26.359 --> 15:27.327
to read you guys in.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.528
At the time
of his death,

15:28.561 --> 15:29.997
Alvarez was still involved

15:30.030 --> 15:31.598
in sensitive operations.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.266
What was he doing
at the coffee shop?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.968
He and Lowe
stayed tight, you know.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.169
I mean, it's not like

15:36.203 --> 15:38.238
they could join
a bowling league together.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.172
DON:
So it was just

15:39.206 --> 15:40.673
- the wrong place, wrong time?
- Exactly.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.175
And I know those guys.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.044
Those guys would have
gone down swinging.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.712
After Lowe was shot,
I'm thinking,

15:45.745 --> 15:47.714
Alvarez must have
broken cover, right,

15:47.747 --> 15:49.616
and fired at their killer.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.518
- You got a suspect?
- Yeah.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.653
Derek Broxton.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.388
Now this guy served seven years

15:55.422 --> 15:56.656
for a bank job.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.525
Lowe put him in there.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.527
Alvarez testified
as a snitch in his trial.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.162
NIKKI: Yeah, released three
months ago.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.264
Skipped bail, believed
to be in Brazil.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.298
Brazil, my ass.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.399
Now, we picked up

16:06.433 --> 16:08.301
his little girlfriend
last night.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.604
And if she's here,
he's here.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.040
All right,
Broxton finds out

16:13.073 --> 16:15.008
that Lowe goes
to the coffee shop regularly.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.177
Maybe he meets
Alvarez there.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.247
And with Broxton's rap sheet,
eight dead is not a stretch.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.748
Yeah, but why didn't...?

16:21.781 --> 16:23.316
You know what?

16:23.350 --> 16:26.019
I'm gonna catch up
with you in a minute, okay?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.154
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.323
(squeaking)

16:30.357 --> 16:31.791
Nice digs you got here.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.326
Oh, hey.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.062
Yeah, you like this, huh?

16:35.095 --> 16:36.329
- Yeah.
- They hooked me up.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.564
Even has a view.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.631
I see.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.799
Pretty cool.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.201
I don't know.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.136
I never thought
I'd miss this so much.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.072
You know, waking up
in the morning,

16:45.105 --> 16:46.639
and crime
scenes, and...

16:46.673 --> 16:48.408
Uh-oh. You're in trouble, man.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.809
You're addicted.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.644
Yeah.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.746
McGowan's coming after me
pretty hard, huh?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.449
Ah, just tell
the truth.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.585
Well, truth is...

16:58.618 --> 17:01.654
you wouldn't be in this position
if it weren't for me.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.556
Charlie, he's coming
after me for me.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.059
You just got to get
your clearance back,

17:06.093 --> 17:06.859
all right?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.628
I mean, I can take care
of myself.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.667
McGOWAN:
As a former military man,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.304
you must realize the
importance of following rules.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.274
Had a lieutenant used to say,
only one rule mattered.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.543
When in doubt,
empty your magazine.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.613
So you approve
of what Professor Eppes did?

17:26.646 --> 17:27.847
No. Not necessarily.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.516
He broke
with policy.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.584
That's undeniable.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.386
Maybe technically,
but...

17:33.420 --> 17:35.355
sometimes following the rules
will get you killed faster.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.557
I was undercover
for three years.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.159
Hmm.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.594
Ended with a commendation
and your pick of assignment.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.464
Yeah, and almost got myself
turned into fish food

17:44.497 --> 17:45.865
in the process.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.168
Charlie went
outside the box,

17:48.201 --> 17:50.503
and saved my ass.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.572
And how about Agent Eppes?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.308
What, are you kidding?

17:55.342 --> 17:58.211
I mean, if Don hadn't listened
to his gut, I'd be dead.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.180
So Agent Eppes broke
with policy, too.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.121
Let's keep going.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.390
Do we have to?

18:10.423 --> 18:13.493
How'd it go
with McGruff the crime dog?

18:13.526 --> 18:15.695
Uh, felt like
I was six years old again,

18:15.728 --> 18:16.663
talking to my old man.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.131
DAVID:
Yeah, five more minutes,

18:18.165 --> 18:19.299
I would have confessed

18:19.332 --> 18:20.200
to the Kennedy assassination.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.372
- Oh, no.
- I've seen this road before.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.307
Which road is that?

18:27.340 --> 18:30.677
One that says,
"all stalkers this way."

18:30.710 --> 18:32.312
I'm just following a hunch.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.381
I'm getting the feeling
she's holding out on us.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.584
(beeps)

18:37.617 --> 18:39.852
DAVID:
I see what you mean.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.654
I'm starting
to get a hunch myself.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.757
(trilling)

18:44.791 --> 18:47.594
COLBY:
A.K.A. Lindsay Farmer.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.762
Arrested for prostitution.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.664
Brought in
by Officer Jerry Lowe.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.767
Schmidt just called.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.237
Derek Broxton's girlfriend
just gave up his loc.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.340
(sighs)

19:02.442 --> 19:03.876
SCHMIDT:
LAPD in place

19:03.910 --> 19:05.578
on the front side.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.747
FBI?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.882
(hushed):
We're clear on the back side.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.585
Flash bangs being thrown

19:12.619 --> 19:14.287
in three, two, one.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.555
(explosions)

19:15.588 --> 19:18.558
(indistinct shouting)

19:20.627 --> 19:21.594
(grunts)

19:21.628 --> 19:22.529
Don't move.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.464
(panting)

19:26.333 --> 19:28.368
(grunts)

19:29.302 --> 19:31.504
(yells)

19:33.005 --> 19:35.575
(engine revving)

19:35.608 --> 19:37.176
(panting)

19:39.346 --> 19:40.513
(grunts)

19:40.547 --> 19:42.315
(grunting)

19:42.349 --> 19:43.783
(sighs and sniffles)

19:53.493 --> 19:54.627
(grunts)

19:54.661 --> 19:55.895
Hands in the air!

19:55.928 --> 19:57.897
Easy.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.832
(gunshots)

19:59.866 --> 20:01.200
(grunts)

20:09.942 --> 20:11.578
(panting)

20:11.611 --> 20:12.745
Why did you shoot?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.880
You know something?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.615
Thank you might be nice,

20:15.648 --> 20:18.251
considering I just
saved your life.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.853
He was surrendering.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.522
He was reaching for his gun.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.991
Well, congratulations,
Hoover boy.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.659
Looks like you just caught
yourself

20:26.693 --> 20:28.695
the coffee shop killer,huh?

20:44.577 --> 20:47.547
I just got a call from a friend
at LAPD Personnel Bureau.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.949
Said you got a-a warrant
to pull Schmidt's PPI file?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.319
I want to see how many
shootings he's been in.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.587
Is that okay by you, Agent?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.556
Schmidt saved your life.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.690
Were you there?

20:57.724 --> 20:58.925
DON:
Whoa, ho, ho.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.327
What's going on?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.928
Nothing.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.530
Well, it doesn't sound like
nothing.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.297
NIKKI: SID found

21:04.331 --> 21:05.865
Alvarez' gun
in Broxton's house

21:05.898 --> 21:07.300
along with a Glock 9mm.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.368
Now, between the two,

21:08.401 --> 21:10.470
we have ballistic matches
for all eight victims in

21:10.503 --> 21:11.604
the coffee shop.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.440
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- DON: Hey.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.575
- Wait a minute. Come here.
- What are you doing? Hey...

21:15.608 --> 21:17.644
That guy's got four years
working for me.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.679
You've got four weeks.
What's your story?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.648
Are we trying to close a
mass murder investigation,

21:21.681 --> 21:22.882
or dime out a hero cop?

21:22.915 --> 21:25.652
Lowe and Alvarez
both had $150,000

21:25.685 --> 21:26.719
in unreported cash
between them.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.821
They both worked for Schmidt,
they're both dead.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.823
This is the FBI.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.560
We police the police,
you understand?

21:35.528 --> 21:38.498
I only got involved with the FBI
to work with my brother.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.733
I should be back at Cal Sci,
I should.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.435
And you know what I am?

21:42.469 --> 21:43.670
I'm a crime junkie.

21:43.703 --> 21:47.039
I should be worrying
about prime numbers

21:47.073 --> 21:49.576
in the Goldbach
conjecture, rather than

21:49.609 --> 21:52.579
the rising number of
187s in-in South Central.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.580
Exactly.

21:53.613 --> 21:56.449
Or, uh, or, you know,
the-the pattern trends

21:56.483 --> 21:57.517
in the Hadamard matrix,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.752
rather than the pattern
trends of 211s in West LA.

21:59.786 --> 22:00.620
Amen.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.989
I took
the Euler-Mascheroni constant

22:03.022 --> 22:05.458
to 1,400,064 digits,

22:05.492 --> 22:07.560
but who knows if that's really
a rational number?

22:07.594 --> 22:09.996
And-And what is a 211?

22:10.029 --> 22:12.465
Maybe it's time to call it a day

22:12.499 --> 22:14.567
and put everything back
into the big question.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.002
There's no
shame in that.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.037
No, I can do more
good for the world

22:18.070 --> 22:20.507
with one important theorem
than I can with

22:20.540 --> 22:22.008
all these
cases combined.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.610
Just last year,
graph theory led

22:23.643 --> 22:25.478
to an increase in the number
of kidney transplants.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.413
Exactly, and who knows

22:26.446 --> 22:28.681
how many thousands
of lives that'll save?

22:28.715 --> 22:30.483
You're scared,
aren't you?

22:30.517 --> 22:31.784
Terrified. I'm...

22:31.818 --> 22:34.554
a consultant who's found
a passion in police work.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.088
That's Don's job,
it's his life.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.891
It's his pension,
it's his health insurance,

22:38.925 --> 22:40.560
and all that's in jeopardy now.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.061
I think you and Don
can handle it.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.431
He sacrificed for me
when we were kids.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.998
I'm sure he has no regrets.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.601
I do. I don't want him to have
to go through that again.

22:50.537 --> 22:54.674
Lowe arrested you
for prostitution,

22:54.707 --> 22:56.576
and you became his CI.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.111
I was out there alone.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.681
He protected me.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.517
No one had ever done things
like that for me before.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.819
I should have told
you, it's just...

23:06.853 --> 23:09.756
I thought it was
all behind me.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.758
I'm trying to open
this little boutique,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.660
secondhand clothes.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.162
I don't need anything messing
up my loan application.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.031
That hurt as much as
it looks like it does?

23:19.065 --> 23:21.634
I want the truth.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.603
Lowe got a little obsessed
with me.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.671
Wanted to leave his wife,

23:24.704 --> 23:26.506
but...

23:26.539 --> 23:30.443
But what, that's a line
you weren't willing to cross?

23:31.578 --> 23:33.646
Life's a balancing act--

23:33.680 --> 23:37.717
you got the good and bad.

23:37.750 --> 23:42.655
Seems one's always pushing
or pulling you to cross it.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.824
(sighs)

23:44.857 --> 23:47.159
When was the last time
you saw Lowe?

23:47.193 --> 23:49.529
Do you ever stop
asking questions?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.936
Looks like Kurt Young
may be telling the truth

23:56.969 --> 23:59.572
about Lowe blackmailing him.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.208
These are cash deposits?

24:02.241 --> 24:03.876
All under what the IRS requires

24:03.910 --> 24:05.478
the bank to declare.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.847
And Benito Alvarez
has matching amounts,

24:07.880 --> 24:09.782
although he's a bit smarter

24:09.816 --> 24:12.685
and he spread them out
over several accounts.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.687
I don't care how much
money Kurt Young has,

24:14.721 --> 24:16.556
blackmail still
gives him motive.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.625
Maybe he just didn't want
that file to get out.

24:18.658 --> 24:19.992
You going to New York?

24:20.026 --> 24:21.794
Yeah, on the red-eye
tomorrow night.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.231
I mean, i-if I didn't have this
thing with McGowan, I just...

24:25.264 --> 24:27.600
Look, you already said
you can't go. Right?

24:27.634 --> 24:29.001
So, let's just move on.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.274
DON:
You know Benito Alvarez?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.678
Lowe's partner.

24:38.711 --> 24:39.846
Aw, come on, man.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.516
The guy had $80,000 of your
money in his bank account.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.784
Confirming what
I've already told you.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.688
And-And why, again, is it that
you didn't come to us before?

24:48.721 --> 24:50.590
And indict two
LAPD cops?

24:50.623 --> 24:53.059
Great way to keep
my secret a secret.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.595
And I take it you haven't
found my file yet.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.930
No, Mr. Young, I don't
give a damn about your file.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.899
(tires screech)
Then what are you doing here?

24:59.932 --> 25:00.900
I got eight

25:00.933 --> 25:03.135
dead people, two of whom
you had a problem with.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.805
If I had killed them,
I'd have my file back.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.608
And I never
would've called you.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.643
Mr. Young.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.679
(engine starting)

25:21.153 --> 25:22.755
LAPD digital records--

25:22.789 --> 25:27.093
every radio call, MDT
transmission, e-mail or report

25:27.126 --> 25:28.861
Lowe or Alvarez ever
put their name on.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.263
How'd you get
them so quickly?

25:31.297 --> 25:33.600
I used to date a guy.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.735
Turns out, now he dates a guy.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.770
(chuckles)

25:37.804 --> 25:40.172
Look, anyway, I'm not saying

25:40.206 --> 25:41.974
that I was wrong
and you were right.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.811
All right? But...

25:44.844 --> 25:46.746
if Lowe and Alvarez
were dirty...

25:46.779 --> 25:48.748
A lot of tapes,

25:48.781 --> 25:49.982
a lot of hours.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.751
I hear there's a guy
over at LAPD

25:51.784 --> 25:54.153
now who comes up
with magic shortcuts.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.690
*

25:57.724 --> 26:01.794
This the way all your
interrogations wind up?

26:01.828 --> 26:05.231
No, this is
definitely a first.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.233
Why'd you do it?

26:07.266 --> 26:11.270
I mean,
become an FBI agent.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.806
Gary Cooper.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.175
Didn't he die
before we were born?

26:16.208 --> 26:19.378
I broke my leg when
I was ten years old,

26:19.411 --> 26:20.813
I spent the whole
summer in bed.

26:20.847 --> 26:23.049
So my uncle gave us his VCR.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.818
My dad, the only movie
he bought was High Noon.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.888
So I just watched that
over and over again.

26:28.921 --> 26:29.722
(giggles)

26:34.393 --> 26:38.865
I still can't figure out why
Lowe called you four times.

26:41.333 --> 26:45.638
Did you get me into bed
to make love or question me?

26:45.672 --> 26:48.140
Marshal Kane gave
back his badge,

26:48.174 --> 26:50.076
but he was never off duty.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.383
This is nice, you know.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.319
A little tranquility
in the eye of the storm.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.354
So, how's life
treating you, Donnie?

27:02.388 --> 27:04.657
You know Robin might be moving
to New York?

27:04.691 --> 27:06.192
- New York?
- She's got some

27:06.225 --> 27:09.028
great opportunity
with this big law firm.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.397
How do you
feel about that?

27:11.430 --> 27:13.399
I don't want her to go.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.669
Have you told her?

27:16.703 --> 27:18.404
Not exactly.
(laughs)

27:22.374 --> 27:25.211
Things never change with you,
do they?

27:25.244 --> 27:28.080
You and your women.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.448
Anyway, it
doesn't matter.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.218
I suppose.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.053
COLBY:
David.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.355
Hey, I was thinking about
sending out a search party

27:36.388 --> 27:37.790
for you.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.693
Yeah, I stopped by
Lynn Potter's house.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.962
What did she have to say?

27:45.197 --> 27:46.098
(sighs)

27:48.735 --> 27:51.237
Please tell me you did not sleep
with a material witness

27:51.270 --> 27:54.306
in a murder investigation.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.443
I screwed up.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.912
No, no, screwing up is leaving
your gun in the bathroom.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.047
This is messed up.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.882
David, it was
a one-time thing, man.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.383
I mean, it was just
bad judgment.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.753
That's terrible judgment.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.223
(sighs)

28:11.257 --> 28:16.495
Look, I don't think
she's a part of it.

28:16.528 --> 28:21.000
This is coming from the guy
who just got naked with her.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.737
Listen to me, man,
you stay away from her.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.338
If you can't manage to do that,

28:26.372 --> 28:28.875
then you make damn sure
that she stays away from you.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.282
So, my program
analyzed those DVDs.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.318
I got my results using
a hidden Markov model.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.486
From machine learning.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.321
You know
what he's talking about?

28:42.354 --> 28:43.856
Aw, you learn
quick around here.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.858
Um... okay,

28:45.892 --> 28:49.228
so, picture a...
a 3-D stereogram.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.898
A field filled
with rows of cabbage.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.833
You don't really see
anything special,

28:53.866 --> 28:55.768
but when you continue
to look at it

28:55.802 --> 28:58.805
and let your eye focus
on a distant point,

28:58.838 --> 29:02.809
you see another picture
hidden within it.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.410
All right, now, similarly,

29:04.443 --> 29:06.979
the information
you've presented here

29:07.013 --> 29:10.216
appears to be an average
distribution of police work.

29:10.249 --> 29:14.320
Until, like the stereogram,
you stare at it,

29:14.353 --> 29:16.789
you look at the data
over and over and over again,

29:16.823 --> 29:19.826
and... a hidden pattern emerges.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.427
This is the sector
that Lowe was patrolling

29:21.460 --> 29:24.130
since he left the
Intelligence Division.

29:24.163 --> 29:27.800
On any shift, there are between
five and eight cars patrolling.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.936
Lowe was Adam-14.
Now, he's supposed

29:29.969 --> 29:32.004
to stay in that sector,
unless a call comes in

29:32.038 --> 29:34.440
where he needs to be readjusted
to back up another unit.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.976
Everything appears to be
fairly random,

29:37.009 --> 29:40.579
until one call comes up.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.981
It's Bel-Air.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.250
Same address
comes up every week.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.819
And Lowe responds
every time. You know,

29:46.853 --> 29:49.255
it's not his sector, but
he's always the closest car.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.190
Because he knows a call
is coming in.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.192
It's Kurt Young's house.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.295
DAVID:
Once a week,

29:56.328 --> 29:57.997
Young dials 911.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.267
Dispatch sends Lowe's car
to respond because it's nearest.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.169
NIKKI: Then Lowe goes inside
Young's house,

30:03.202 --> 30:04.203
picks up the cash.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.205
No witnesses, nice and clean.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.941
After every call, Lowe goes
code seven--

30:08.975 --> 30:12.511
that's a lunch break-- with a
detective unit from

30:12.544 --> 30:14.113
Robbery/Homicide Division.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.116
Schmidt.
His old boss from Intel.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.953
All right, Schmidt's too smart
to show up at Young's house.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.855
Lowe's his bagman.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.023
DON:
Two weeks ago,

30:24.056 --> 30:26.926
look who shows up three
times in two days.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.862
(sighs) Yeah, maybe Schmidt got
tired of splitting

30:29.896 --> 30:31.263
the money with
Lowe and Alvarez.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.900
Schmidt cuts a side deal
with Young.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.902
Lump of cash for the file.

30:35.935 --> 30:36.835
It's a buyout.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.071
Yeah, but Schmidt
doesn't have the file.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.207
Lowe does.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.310
Schmidt confronts Lowe
and Alvarez at the coffee shop,

30:44.343 --> 30:45.577
but they won't give it up.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.546
Schmidt has to kill

30:47.579 --> 30:50.149
Lowe, Alvarez and the cook.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.418
Then he has to make sure
there are no witnesses.

30:52.451 --> 30:53.986
So he takes Alvarez's gun

30:54.020 --> 30:56.155
and shoots
the remaining five customers.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.289
(gunshots)

30:57.323 --> 30:58.958
That's a great theory.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.292
How the hell do we prove that?

31:08.567 --> 31:10.903
(projector humming)

31:18.610 --> 31:20.479
Those are weekly calls

31:20.512 --> 31:22.915
to 911-- burglary, vandalism,
trespassing.

31:22.949 --> 31:23.983
All with your voice.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.385
I pay a lot of taxes.

31:26.418 --> 31:30.056
Part of my right is to have
the police respond promptly.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.259
Lowe shows up at your house
every week, and he's dead.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.928
I did not hide the fact that he
was blackmailing me.

31:35.962 --> 31:38.564
And Schmidt shows up
two weeks ago instead.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.934
All right,
I'm calling your supervisor.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.435
I already did.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.004
You know what?
He called the US Attorney.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.073
So, I think you might be
out of friends.

31:47.106 --> 31:50.142
Schmidt said he was going
to get my file.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.078
I didn't ask how.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.545
Whatever he did,

31:53.579 --> 31:55.381
it's not my
responsibility.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.016
You're going to help me.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.284
(laughs):
Oh,

31:58.317 --> 32:01.520
and what, testify against a cop
who just killed eight people?

32:01.553 --> 32:02.989
He sees me show up in
the same room

32:03.022 --> 32:04.556
as you, I'm going
to be number nine.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.558
And if you had a real case
against Schmidt,

32:06.592 --> 32:09.561
you wouldn't even need me.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.297
Roll scene seven.
(intercom beeps)

32:11.330 --> 32:12.731
MAN (over intercom):
Right away, Mr. Young.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.067
Hey, do you mind?

32:17.169 --> 32:19.938
DON:
You killed eight people.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.610
SCHMIDT: And just who's your
source-- Kurt Young?

32:24.643 --> 32:28.047
Hmm? The man makes movies
for a living.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.381
He's got to have a vivid
imagination.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.649
Well...

32:30.682 --> 32:31.350
you would know, I mean, you're
the one who's blackmailing him.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.519
Yeah, good luck getting Young

32:33.552 --> 32:34.786
to the witness stand.

32:34.820 --> 32:38.657
He's probably going to have to
cancel his waxing appointment.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.027
(chuckles)
What...?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.561
You went to get the file from
Lowe and-and

32:42.594 --> 32:44.230
- he didn't have it?
- What file?

32:44.263 --> 32:45.597
(laughs)

32:45.631 --> 32:47.599
I'm not in handcuffs.
I don't see

32:47.633 --> 32:50.202
my union rep, so...

32:50.236 --> 32:52.704
I'm thinking you've got
absolutely nothing on me...

32:52.738 --> 32:55.007
Don.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.009
Come on, Eppes,

32:57.043 --> 32:58.777
you know I've been playing
this game as long as you have.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.779
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.182
How's 20 years sound?

33:03.215 --> 33:04.516
Thirty?

33:04.550 --> 33:06.352
Life?

33:06.385 --> 33:09.255
You know something-- I came
in here under my own power...

33:09.288 --> 33:12.291
and I'm leaving the same way.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.260
You know, I hear that sodium
thiopental is cold

33:14.293 --> 33:16.062
when it goes in your veins.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.996
You look forward
to that.

33:26.172 --> 33:29.075
(sighs)

33:29.108 --> 33:31.210
Eh, Schmidt doesn't
have the file.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.380
Without the file,
he gets no money.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.514
Lowe panicked.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.548
Why?

33:36.582 --> 33:38.584
He made four phone calls.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.752
He was trying to get the file.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.289
And the person holding it
for him didn't answer.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.590
(sighs)

33:44.623 --> 33:46.292
I'll get the warrant
for Lynn Potter.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.294
You don't move until I get back.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.530
(sighs)

34:01.273 --> 34:04.243
You know, Charlie, I haven't
seen you this concerned

34:04.276 --> 34:06.512
since you were being considered
for a Fields.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.647
AMITA: You know,
he's right, Charlie.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.183
The charges were dropped,
and you helped a friend out.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.851
You should feel confident and
proud.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.686
What if

34:14.720 --> 34:16.822
getting my clearance back

34:16.855 --> 34:18.357
means betraying

34:18.390 --> 34:19.625
my brother?

34:21.160 --> 34:23.729
It's a bit like Socrates,
isn't it?

34:23.762 --> 34:27.099
Sentenced to die but with
the opportunity to live--

34:27.133 --> 34:29.401
if he renounced

34:29.435 --> 34:31.337
everything
he believed in.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.874
Professor Eppes,
my first question

34:35.907 --> 34:38.810
involves case #9767--

34:38.844 --> 34:40.846
subject by the name
of Crystal Hoyle.

34:40.879 --> 34:44.383
Crystal Hoyle
who kidnapped Agent Reeves?

34:44.416 --> 34:45.551
I understand

34:45.584 --> 34:47.553
Agent Ian Edgerton
beat a suspect

34:47.586 --> 34:48.887
and your brother allowed it.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.756
I don't know anything
about that.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.558
I know

34:52.591 --> 34:54.193
Megan's life was at stake.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.195
So you're an ends

34:56.228 --> 34:58.330
justify the means
kind of guy?

34:58.364 --> 35:00.132
I'm simply saying

35:00.166 --> 35:03.802
that I've learned from watching
the men and women at the FBI,

35:03.835 --> 35:06.138
that risking your own life

35:06.172 --> 35:08.440
invariably saves others.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.343
Even if, on occasion, that means
breaking the rules.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.411
Mmm, like your brother did

35:12.444 --> 35:14.846
when he let Clay Porter,
a deadly felon, walk away.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.449
Agent McGowan,
I thought this was about me--

35:17.483 --> 35:19.485
getting my security

35:19.518 --> 35:20.419
- clearance back?
- You don't think

35:20.452 --> 35:22.588
I felt like beating
my share of crooks?

35:23.722 --> 35:25.757
Hmm?

35:25.791 --> 35:27.526
Guys who run kiddie
porn rings,

35:27.559 --> 35:29.528
turn 13 year olds
out on the street.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.530
But I didn't--

35:31.563 --> 35:34.533
because there are rules
we must adhere to.

35:34.566 --> 35:37.703
Rules prevent misuse of power.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.872
Just as we've sworn
to uphold all the laws...

35:40.906 --> 35:44.576
we don't get to choose
which rules we obey.

35:49.215 --> 35:52.184
"Crito, we owe a rooster
to Asclepius.

35:52.218 --> 35:55.221
Please don't forget
to pay the debt."

35:55.254 --> 35:57.223
Excuse me?

35:58.624 --> 36:00.792
I'm not going to throw
my brother under a bus.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.729
He threw himself under the bus.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.731
We both know
your brother's

36:05.764 --> 36:07.266
been getting more
and more reckless.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.268
One of these screw-ups...

36:09.301 --> 36:11.603
he won't be able to cover.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.639
Help him.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.641
I'll be at home waiting
for your decision.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.844
And I will respect your decision
either way.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.553
*

36:27.586 --> 36:28.854
I'm glad you called.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.790
I wasn't sure I'd get
to see you tonight.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.795
Nice to see you, too.

36:38.597 --> 36:41.567
You lied to me the
first time we met,

36:41.600 --> 36:43.502
you haven't stopped since.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.506
That's all gonna
end right now.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.912
You're an accessory
to murder.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.981
I'm not a criminal.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.752
Why don't you stop
talking like a cop

37:00.786 --> 37:03.389
and start acting
like a human being?

37:06.825 --> 37:09.461
You are a son of a bitch.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.531
Listen to me.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.566
This guy's killed
eight people.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.935
We connected the dots,
so trust me,

37:16.968 --> 37:18.937
so has he.
Leave me alone.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.572
(phone rings)

37:21.673 --> 37:23.475
(clears throat)
Not now, David.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.777
I have the warrant,
let's do this right.

37:25.811 --> 37:26.945
We don't want her walking.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.246
Don't worry, she's not walking.

37:33.985 --> 37:34.853
(keyless entry chirps)

37:34.886 --> 37:36.855
You've jeopardized
this investigation.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.824
Yeah, gotta go.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.329
Lynn...

37:43.362 --> 37:44.863
Lynn, wait a minute.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.499
I was holding onto the file
as a favor.

37:47.533 --> 37:48.934
I may have broke it off
with Lowe,

37:48.967 --> 37:50.636
but I still cared about him.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.971
You want it? Fine.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.873
Take the damn thing.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.007
Just let me go.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.817
(car alarm blaring)

38:07.953 --> 38:08.854
(grunts)

38:22.033 --> 38:25.871
You paid Lowe and
Alvarez over $150,000.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.407
I have never denied that.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.876
From a bank account in
France, via New Zealand...

38:30.909 --> 38:34.413
where there's a holding company
that wrote checks for a movie

38:34.446 --> 38:36.415
called City
of Twilight,

38:36.448 --> 38:38.584
that's being released
by your studio.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.852
What I do with my money
is my business.

38:40.886 --> 38:41.887
What you do

38:41.920 --> 38:44.923
with stockholders' money,
that's our business.

38:44.956 --> 38:45.924
(tapping glass)

38:45.957 --> 38:48.394
Especially fraud.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.532
Thanks, Col.

38:57.503 --> 38:58.404
(chuckles)

38:59.571 --> 39:01.840
Oh, very photogenic.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.050
I got it.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.620
No, I want to do this.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.395
Put your hands
behind your back

39:23.429 --> 39:25.130
and interlock
your fingers.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.873
(handcuffs click)

39:34.906 --> 39:36.808
(laughs)

39:45.183 --> 39:46.151
Hey.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.987
So you're going, huh?

39:52.123 --> 39:54.760
Look...

39:54.793 --> 39:56.762
I want you to have
every opportunity

39:56.795 --> 39:58.029
that-that you deserve.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.965
I-I... I do.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.703
I just would like you

40:04.736 --> 40:06.638
to have them here.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.809
With me.

40:12.844 --> 40:15.046
(chuckling sigh)

40:15.080 --> 40:17.783
*

40:17.816 --> 40:19.851
Exactly how many
frequent flier miles

40:19.885 --> 40:21.587
were you going to
make me rack up

40:21.620 --> 40:23.622
before you said
something?

40:23.655 --> 40:26.625
If someone asked you
if it was worth it...

40:26.658 --> 40:28.627
Eventually, someone will.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.563
Which is why
you have to go.

40:33.832 --> 40:36.735
I meant getting
the file back.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.040
That's what I do.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.943
I'll never tell anyone,
you have to realize that.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.713
Yeah, but I'll know.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.615
I'm always going to know.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.785
We never had a
chance, did we?

40:55.721 --> 40:58.089
You're right.

40:58.123 --> 41:01.026
Besides, Gary Cooper got Grace
Kelly, not the hooker.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.965
*

41:11.537 --> 41:13.539
So?

41:13.572 --> 41:15.574
What happened?

41:15.607 --> 41:17.075
Oh.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.077
Just exactly
what I was afraid of.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.913
In order to get
my clearance back,

41:21.947 --> 41:25.183
he wanted me to give up Don.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.553
And what did you say?

41:29.688 --> 41:32.057
I can always get another job--

41:32.090 --> 41:34.826
I only have one brother.

41:34.860 --> 41:35.861
(knocking on door)

41:37.328 --> 41:39.598
Agent Eppes.

41:39.631 --> 41:40.632
Have a seat.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.568
Is that thing on?

41:44.202 --> 41:45.203
(clicks)

41:46.605 --> 41:48.006
Is now.

41:51.777 --> 41:56.147
* And there's no way
around it... *

41:56.181 --> 41:58.884
Charlie Eppes is a vital part

41:58.917 --> 42:00.752
of the FBI.

42:00.786 --> 42:03.188
And as Supervisor

42:03.221 --> 42:06.024
of the Los Angeles
Violent Crime Squad,

42:06.057 --> 42:10.128
it is my belief that I cannot
perform my duties without him.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.201
You realize what you're saying.

42:16.234 --> 42:19.104
Yeah.
Charlie's back, or I'm gone.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.139
(recorder clicks)

42:21.172 --> 42:24.710
You and your brother have the
same way of looking at things.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.678
You know that?

42:33.051 --> 42:36.021
I haven't heard that, but, uh...

42:36.054 --> 42:38.323
I'll take it.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.595
*
