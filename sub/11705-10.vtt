01:52.195 --> 01:53.947
{\an8}THIS IS HOUSE BUSINESS.
- NO, NO.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.448
{\an8}HE'S GONNA STAY,
BECAUSE HE'S MY FRIEND

01:55.532 --> 01:57.575
{\an8}AND I'M TALKING TO HIM.
- THIS IS FAMILY BUSINESS.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.409

HE HAS TO LEAVE.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.662
{\an8}SHE CAN HOOK UP WITH YOU
LATER.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.871
{\an8}- IF I GOTTA GO, I'LL GO.
THAT'S COOL.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.748
{\an8}- GIMME THE THING
SO I CAN WRITE DOWN HIS NUMBER

02:03.832 --> 02:05.542
{\an8}SO I CAN CALL HIM LATER.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.043

{\an8}'CAUSE WHO THE HELL WOULD WANT
ANGELINA TO CALL HIM AFTER THAT?

02:12.131 --> 02:13.508

02:13.591 --> 02:14.384
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.803

EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE

02:35.989 --> 02:38.241
{\an8}HAS BASICALLY BROKEN ME DOWN

02:38.324 --> 02:40.451

FIND 'EM LIKE THAT THESE DAYS.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.147
{\an8}- BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

16:22.231 --> 16:23.691
{\an8}HOW WAS HE, YOU KNOW?

16:23.774 --> 16:27.528
{\an8}[laughter]

16:28.487 --> 16:30.364
{\an8}LIKE WILL YOU BE
COMING BACK, YOU KNOW?

16:30.447 --> 16:32.199
{\an8}[laughter]

16:32.282 --> 16:35.285
{\an8}- IT'S JUST US, GIRL TALK.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.495
{\an8}- TYPICAL MIKE.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.414
{\an8}HE GOT IT IN WITH HER

16:38.497 --> 16:40.290
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK
MIKE'S DONE WITH HER.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.917
{\an8}AND THAT'S FINE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.545
{\an8}LET HIM DO HIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.426
{\an8}- YEAH, I'D LIKE TO THANK JOSE
FOR BEIN' RESPECTABLE.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.095
{\an8}- I SAID THAT TOO LAST NIGHT,
BUT I COULDN'T TALK.

16:53.178 --> 16:53.971
{\an8}- YOU DID NOT.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.222
{\an8}- WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.892
{\an8}AND LIKE YOU STRAIGHT
SLEPT IN MY BED WITH YOUR DUDE.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.061
{\an8}LUCKY I'M FRIENDS WITH THE KID,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.438
{\an8}- HEY, I APPRECIATE IT,
DUDE, YOU KNOW?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.064
{\an8}NOT FOR NOTHING.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.816
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA BE COOL
'CAUSE I SAID THANK YOU NOW?

17:05.898 --> 17:07.233
{\an8}- YEAH.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.778
{\an8}- JUST--IT'S A RESPECT THING.
IT'S A PRINCIPLE THING.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.115
{\an8}- NO.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.372
{\an8}- I'M HAPPY TO GET OUT
OF THIS HOUSE, THOUGH.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.125
{\an8}LET ME TELL YOU.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.210
{\an8}- DYSFUNCTIONAL HOUSE, RIGHT?

17:25.294 --> 17:28.797
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA WALK YOU OUT.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.424
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU, BRO.

17:30.507 --> 17:34.303
{\an8}I'M REALLY LIKE UPSET
THAT MY GIRLFRIEND HAS TO LEAVE.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.638
{\an8}SHE'S LIKE MY SERENITY
IN THIS HOUSE.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.307
{\an8}IT KINDA SUCKED
TO SEE THAT GO.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.350
{\an8}- IT'S ALMOST OVER, OKAY?
- YEAH.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.268
{\an8}- I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.479
{\an8}I HAD SO MUCH FUN.
- I HAD FUN.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.230
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS
[bleep] MAD DRAMA.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.357
{\an8}BUT, YOU KNOW, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.485
{\an8}HAVE FUN.
CALL ME, OKAY?

17:49.568 --> 17:50.736
{\an8}- I MISS YOU GUYS.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.029
{\an8}YOU ARE MY [bleep]
TRUE FRIENDS.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.240
{\an8}I'M REALLY LIKE UPSET
THAT MY GIRLFRIEND HAS TO LEAVE.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.575
{\an8}IT'S GONNA SUCK FOR ME

17:56.658 --> 17:57.534
{\an8}BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT ANYBODY'S

17:57.618 --> 17:59.411
{\an8}MY REAL TRUE FRIEND
IN THIS HOUSE.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.331
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY I'M A BITCH,
BECAUSE I CAN'T...

18:02.414 --> 18:03.248
{\an8}DEAL WITH THIS.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.000
{\an8}IT'S JUST...IT'S JUST....

18:05.083 --> 18:06.376
{\an8}YOU KNOW?
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.963
{\an8}LOVE YOU.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.472
{\an8}- I GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT
WITH HER YESTERDAY,

18:18.555 --> 18:20.891
{\an8}AND SHE HAS THE AUDACITY,
'CAUSE SHE HAS HER FRIEND OVER,

18:20.974 --> 18:22.017
{\an8}TO SLEEP IN MY BED
WITH HER MAN.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.394
{\an8}YOU DO NOT [bleep]
SLEEP IN MY BED--

18:24.478 --> 18:25.437
{\an8}- WITH JOSE?
- YEAH.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.147
{\an8}YOU EITHER [bleep] SLEEP
ON THE COUCH

18:27.231 --> 18:29.191
{\an8}AND YOU [bleep] SLEEP
[bleep] WHEREVER YOU WANT,

18:29.274 --> 18:30.692
{\an8}BUT NOT IN MY [bleep] BED.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.028
{\an8}- ANGELINA'S SLEEPING
ON MIKE'S BED

18:33.111 --> 18:34.404
{\an8}IS LIKE DISTURBING,

18:34.488 --> 18:36.365
{\an8}'CAUSE SHE PUNCHED HIM
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.493
{\an8}YOU'RE GIVING THESE PEOPLE
REASONS TO RIP YOU APART.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.870
{\an8}YOU'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING
TO FIX IT.

18:41.954 --> 18:46.166
{\an8}- I TALKED TO HER ON
A SPECIFIC LEVEL LAST NIGHT,

18:46.250 --> 18:48.794
{\an8}AS A WOMAN,
TO SHUT HER [bleep] MOUTH

18:48.877 --> 18:49.753
{\an8}AND TO STAY THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,

18:49.837 --> 18:54.174
{\an8}AND YET SHE CONTINUED?

18:54.258 --> 18:55.884
{\an8}- [bleep] BROAD
SLEEPS IN MY BED

18:55.968 --> 18:58.011
{\an8}WITH [bleep] JOSE LAST NIGHT,
DOESN'T HAVE--

18:58.095 --> 19:00.806
{\an8}- OH, SHUT THE [bleep] UP.
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP?

19:00.889 --> 19:02.266
{\an8}YOU WERE WRONG!
- I DON'T CARE!

19:02.349 --> 19:05.477
{\an8}THEN TO MY MAN'S FACE,
HE'S SAYING IT'S ALL GOOD, BRO.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.396
{\an8}- NO, BECAUSE HE APOLOGIZED,
NOT YOU!

19:07.479 --> 19:08.730
{\an8}- NO, I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.316
{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
WHAT ANYONE THINKS ABOUT ME

19:11.400 --> 19:12.568
{\an8}IN THIS HOUSE.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.861
{\an8}I DON'T CARE!
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.070
{\an8}I WILL SAY
THAT YOU WERE WRONG

19:15.153 --> 19:16.655
{\an8}FOR SLEEPING IN MY BED
LAST NIGHT--JUST ADMIT IT.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.907
{\an8}- I SAID THANK YOU WHEN YOU
WERE STANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE

19:18.991 --> 19:20.659
{\an8}RIGHT IN FRONT OF
THE KID'S FACE.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.537
{\an8}- JUST TELL ME FACE-TO-FACE
THAT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST ASK ME.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.997
{\an8}- DROP IT.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.415
{\an8}- WHO THE [bleep] ARE YOU
TO SAY DROP IT?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.041
{\an8}- DROP IT.
- YOU SLEPT IN MY BED.

19:28.125 --> 19:28.917
{\an8}DROP YOUR [bleep] BIG ASS!

19:29.001 --> 19:32.129
{\an8}- DROP YOUR UGLY FACE.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.799
{\an8}- AH...JUST GOT
A WHIFF OF THAT.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.176
{\an8}IT SMELLED LIKE SOMETHING
[bleep] DIED IN THE CAR.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.095
{\an8}IT'S--IT'S--
[gags]

19:40.178 --> 19:41.972
{\an8}- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
ANGE?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.390
{\an8}- I CAN STAY WITH A BUNCH
OF FAKE PEOPLE

19:43.473 --> 19:44.725
{\an8}THAT DON'T LIKE ME.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.560
{\an8}- HOW 'BOUT THIS?
YOU CAN GET THE [bleep] OUT.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.604
{\an8}HOW 'BOUT THAT ONE?
'CAUSE YOU LEFT IN JERSEY,

19:48.687 --> 19:49.396
{\an8}AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL
LEAVE NOW TOO.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.276
{\an8}- JUST TELL ME FACE-TO-FACE

19:54.359 --> 19:55.611
{\an8}THAT YOU SHOULD
AT LEAST ASK ME.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.154
{\an8}- DROP IT.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.906
{\an8}- WHO THE [bleep] ARE YOU
TO SAY DROP IT?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.449
{\an8}- DROP IT.
- YOU SLEPT IN MY BED.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.117
{\an8}DROP YOUR [bleep] BIG ASS.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.744
{\an8}- DROP YOUR UGLY FACE.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.120
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD, MY UGLY FACE?
- HOW 'BOUT THAT?

20:05.203 --> 20:07.873
{\an8}- ANGELINA NEEDS
TO RECOGNIZE HER FAULT

20:07.956 --> 20:09.541
{\an8}AND JUST ADMIT THAT SHE'S WRONG.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.835
{\an8}BUT SHE'S THE TYPE OF GIRL
THAT WILL NEVER DO THAT.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.629
{\an8}- WHOEVER WANTS A [bleep]
AT ME RIGHT NOW,

20:13.712 --> 20:15.130
{\an8}DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

20:15.213 --> 20:15.672
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA BE ANGELINA
SIT THERE NO MORE.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.216
{\an8}[bleep] THAT.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.302
{\an8}I TRY TO BE ALL NICE TO
EVERYBODY IN THIS [bleep] HOUSE.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.304
{\an8}- YOU'RE A [bleep] LOSER.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.513
{\an8}- IN A SENSE, I KNOW
WHERE SHE'S COMING FROM.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.309
{\an8}MIKE CAN DEFINITELY PUSH
THE HOT BUTTONS ON A PERSON.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.685
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

20:28.769 --> 20:29.895
{\an8}HE'S JUST TREATING HER
LIKE A PIECE OF [bleep].

20:29.978 --> 20:32.648
{\an8}- AND I WILL BE A BITCH
TO ANYONE IN THIS [bleep] HOUSE

20:32.731 --> 20:34.024
{\an8}THAT PISSES ME OFF FROM NOW ON,

20:34.107 --> 20:35.943
{\an8}BECAUSE I THINK I [bleep]
DESERVE TO BE IN THIS HOUSE

20:36.026 --> 20:37.486
{\an8}JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE HERE,
AND I'VE BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL

20:37.569 --> 20:40.197
{\an8}TO A LOT OF PEOPLE--I LET
A LOT OF PEOPLE STEP ON ME.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.865
{\an8}SO [bleep] THAT.
NO MORE.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.742
{\an8}ONE PERSON WANTS TO SAY
SOMETHING,

20:43.825 --> 20:44.952
{\an8}COME IN MY FACE,
AND WE'LL FIGHT.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.495
{\an8}THAT'S IT.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.621
{\an8}- HA HA!

20:47.704 --> 20:49.039
{\an8}- I'M SICK OF PROVING MYSELF.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.500
{\an8}I DON'T THINK I NEED TO PROVE
MYSELF TO ANYONE IN THIS HOUSE.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.668
{\an8}I AM ME.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

20:52.751 --> 20:53.919
{\an8}THEN DON'T [bleep]
LOOK AT ME.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.212
{\an8}THAT'S IT.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.172
{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
WHAT YOU SAY!

20:57.255 --> 20:58.048
{\an8}- EXACTLY!
YOU'RE [bleep] WRONG!

20:58.131 --> 21:00.842
{\an8}ANGELINA
DOESN'T WANT TO LISTEN.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.135
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T WANT TO COOPERATE.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.971
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE PART OF THIS FAMILY.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.681
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T WANT TO APOLOGIZE
OR MAKE UP

21:05.764 --> 21:07.057
{\an8}OR DO ANYTHING IN THIS HOUSE.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.517
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
I'M JUST SHUTTING MY MOUTH,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.143
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU DON'T MEAN
ANYTHING TO ME, SO...

21:10.227 --> 21:12.604
{\an8}- OKAY. SO GET THE [bleep]

21:17.275 --> 21:21.196
{\an8}- IT'S WAKE UP THE WHOLE
ENTIRE HOUSE TIME!

21:21.822 --> 21:26.243

{\an8}LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.499

{\an8}HE--HE...HE'S GONNA
HAVE AN ALARM CLOCK SOON.

21:40.298 --> 21:41.800
{\an8}- WHO ELSE IS NOT UP?

21:41.883 --> 21:42.426
{\an8}PFFT!

21:46.430 --> 21:48.890
{\an8}- IS MIKE READY?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.947
{\an8}- IS THERE SOMETHING
UNDER THE SEAT OR SOMETHING?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.240
{\an8}- I'M GONNA THROW UP.

22:05.323 --> 22:08.618
{\an8}- SO WE GET INTO THE ESCALADE
AND IT SMELLED LIKE...

22:08.702 --> 22:09.911
{\an8}SOMEBODY [bleep] DIED
IN THE CAR.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.246

22:11.329 --> 22:12.706
{\an8}- YOU REALLY GONNA THROW UP?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.087
{\an8}- SMELLS LIKE THROW UP.

22:19.171 --> 22:19.921
{\an8}- IS THERE ANYTHING

22:20.005 --> 22:21.131
{\an8}LIKE FOOD OR SOMETHING?

22:21.214 --> 22:23.717
{\an8}- UNDER THE MAT?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.302
{\an8}- WHAT?

22:25.385 --> 22:27.054

22:27.137 --> 22:27.346
{\an8}- WHAT?

22:31.516 --> 22:32.768
{\an8}- A CHEESE SANDWICH.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.853
{\an8}- SOMEBODY LEFT A GRILLED
CHICKEN AND CHEESE SANDWICH

{\an8}WITH SWISS CHEESE.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.607
{\an8}- IT HAD BACON ON IT.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.525
{\an8}- HA.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.278
{\an8}- ANGELINA PROBABLY LEFT
THE SWISS CHEESE IN THE CAR,

22:43.361 --> 22:45.447
{\an8}BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW
THAT RATS LOVE CHEESE.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.240
{\an8}- [bleep] GROSS.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.535
{\an8}- OH, GOD.

{\an8}DID ANYBODY SAY
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT ME

22:55.248 --> 22:56.375
{\an8}THIS MORNING?

22:56.458 --> 22:57.793
{\an8}- ARE YOU STAYING?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.461
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.839
{\an8}WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU

{\an8}- [chuckles] I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO SAY, LIKE, YOU KNOW?

23:07.552 --> 23:11.264
{\an8}- ANGELINA WILL NOT TAKE
ANYBODY'S ADVICE.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.308
{\an8}LIKE I JUST FEEL LIKE
IT'S A TICKING TIME BOMB

23:13.391 --> 23:15.310
{\an8}BEFORE THE GIRL JUST LEAVES.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.194
{\an8}- OH, GOD.

IS A JUICE HEAD.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.078
{\an8}CAN I FIND THAT SOMEWHERE?

23:33.161 --> 23:35.622
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA
GO ON MATCH.COM AGAIN.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.293
{\an8}- HE IS ANGELINA'S EX GUY

23:40.377 --> 23:41.837
{\an8}THAT ANGELINA
BROUGHT HOME ONCE.
