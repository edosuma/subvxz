01:45.480 --> 01:46.773
- Mrs. Roy?
- Lynn.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.358
You called in
a missing person?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.776
- He's been gone all night.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.737
Name's Conrad Roy III.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.031
It's unusual him
being gone all night?

01:54.031 --> 01:57.409
- Absolutely. His phone's off,
straight to voice mail.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.952
<i>It's never off.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:01.621
And he's, uh--
<i>how old is he, 18?</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:03.040
<i>I don't want to hear</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:04.833
<i>any of that "24 hour,</i>
<i>he's an adult" crap.</i>

02:04.833 --> 02:06.168
<i>He always comes home.</i>

02:06.168 --> 02:08.462
<i>This is where he sleeps.</i>

02:08.462 --> 02:11.298
<i>Or at Co's--his dad, my ex.</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:13.258
He hasn't heard
from him either.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.719
He's out driving right now
looking for him.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.429
And what's
your son driving?

02:17.429 --> 02:20.474
<i>Ford F-250, black.</i>

02:20.474 --> 02:23.894
<i>Maybe he's at the docks.</i>
<i>He works there with his dad.</i>

02:30.484 --> 02:33.153
Any reason
<i>he'd up and disappear?</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:36.073
- Drugs? He into drugs?

02:36.073 --> 02:38.116
- I mean, a little pot.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.785

<i>You there, David?</i>

02:39.785 --> 02:41.411

<i>Go ahead, dispatch.</i>

02:41.411 --> 02:43.622
We've got a possible
<i>sighting of a black F-250</i>

02:43.622 --> 02:45.707
<i>at the Kmart parking lot,</i>
<i>nine miles away.</i>

02:45.707 --> 02:47.000
- Copy.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.689
Dispatch, we're gonna need
paramedics, fire...

03:50.689 --> 03:51.773
M.E.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.692
<i>Copy that. Stand by.</i>

04:19.885 --> 04:22.512
- What the fuck?
What the fuck?

04:25.474 --> 04:27.517
I'm going over there.
- You can't come in here, sir.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.935
- Hey, hey, hey. Hold up.
- Back up.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.520
- Hold up. Who are you?
What's your name?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.897
- You want to know
my fucking name?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.523
Check in the fucking glove box.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.567
That's my grandson's truck!

04:35.567 --> 04:37.736
Let me by! Let me by!

04:37.736 --> 04:39.738
This is my grandson's truck.
Did you hear me?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.351
- Co.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.313
Are you with the girls
<i>right now?</i>

05:13.313 --> 05:15.649
- Yeah. Why?

05:16.983 --> 05:20.278
- There's yellow tape
around our son's truck.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.155
What's your name?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.011
- How about Vasquez?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.596
- Oh, total
all-around drubbing.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.057
- Yeah, Sox are still gonna end
up dead last.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.559
Mark my words.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.853
- "Mark"--What are you,
Raymond Chandler?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.339
Hey.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.341
Kid killed himself
this weekend.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.718
- Yeah.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.136
Were you gonna tell me
about it

06:26.136 --> 06:28.388
or just let me babble on
about the game?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.764
Conrad Roy.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.433
- Yeah. You know him?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.144
- Uh, not the kid,
but the family--

06:34.144 --> 06:35.729
not personally.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.772
But it says we got his
cell phone in evidence

06:37.772 --> 06:39.441
but no pass code.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.277
- Yeah, uh, another guy named
Conrad called earlier.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.195
Claims he's the kid's granddad.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.489
Said he could send us
the pass code.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.283
- So did you get it?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.035
- Uh, not yet, no.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.039
You want me to call him back?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.874
- You're gonna be
an 80-year-old beat cop

06:55.874 --> 06:57.292
patrolling in a fucking Rascal,

06:57.292 --> 06:59.210
you don't get your shit
together.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.212
Mark my words.
Yeah.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.929
Mrs. Roy.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.033
- Michelle?

09:35.033 --> 09:36.743
Michelle, what is it?

09:40.872 --> 09:44.334
- Conrad's dead.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.797
- Who's Conrad?

10:58.616 --> 11:00.410
- This is weird.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.787
- Of course it's weird.
He's dead.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.415
- You didn't even know him.
- She asked us to come.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.127
Just...be nice for once.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.463
- Michelle?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.467
- Guys, you came.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.221
- It's okay.

11:22.348 --> 11:26.394
I just can't believe
he's gone.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.483
Hayden, can you give us
some privacy, please?

11:40.950 --> 11:43.411
Door.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.876
Ho--how--

11:51.461 --> 11:52.587
How are you doing?

11:52.587 --> 11:54.839
- It means a lot
that you guys came.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.841
- Of course.
- Yeah.

11:56.841 --> 12:01.095
- I know I haven't always
been the best best friend.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.639
Oh, it's okay.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.850
Don't--
don't worry about it.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.646
- I just loved him so much.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.898
- I know.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.317
- And he loved me.
- Of course he did.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.114
It's all my fault.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.658
I should have been there
for him.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.576
I should have known.
- Don't say that.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.536
You were texting us the whole
time, trying to find him.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.538
- I know. I know.
- You sent me and Cassie,

12:27.538 --> 12:30.333
like, a thousand messages.
Okay?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.085
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.306
- Oh, wait, wait.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.725
Now that you guys are here,
you can help me pick out

12:47.725 --> 12:49.936
what I'm supposed to wear
to the funeral.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.313
I have to look perfect...

12:52.313 --> 12:54.607
For his mom, for his family.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.694
So they know
that I care, you know?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.279
Oh, God.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.407
Something Conrad
would have liked.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.742
I mean...

13:04.742 --> 13:07.537
what do you think?

13:07.537 --> 13:12.041
- Uh...maybe something
with a little less pattern.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.877
Um, maybe something, like,
all black.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.090
Yeah.
Yeah, that's nice.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.218
- Like this?
- That could be good.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.102
- You said he
smoked himself, right?

13:31.102 --> 13:32.520
Yeah. Uh...

13:32.520 --> 13:35.940
He swiped a water pump
from his granddad's shed.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.735
- What's bothering you?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.361
When I opened the phone,

13:40.361 --> 13:43.656
there was only one text
exchange on the whole thing.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.367
- Yeah, and?
- You know any 18-year-olds

13:46.367 --> 13:48.036
with only one text exchange
on their phone?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.954
- I don't go through many
18-year-old's phones,

13:49.954 --> 13:52.165
but I'll play along.
Who was it with?

13:52.165 --> 13:55.126
- This girl, Michelle Carter.

13:57.003 --> 14:01.340
Okay, so, at 6:25 p. m.,
he tells her

14:01.340 --> 14:03.593
he's almost there.
She says, "Okay."

14:03.593 --> 14:06.262
Then from there on out,
it's just inbound from her.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.931
And I'm smushing texts together
so you don't get bored.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.559
But, okay, now, this is--
this is three hours later.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.729
"Please answer me.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.273
I'm scared.
I thought you actually did it."

14:21.402 --> 14:24.405
Then he deletes every text
with other contacts

14:24.405 --> 14:26.199
and whatever he was texting
with this girl

14:26.199 --> 14:27.950
before that first "okay."

14:27.950 --> 14:30.787
- Well, he's hiding something.
- Yeah.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
You can find out
what it is, right?

14:34.207 --> 14:37.752
- Well, you're not here 'cause
I'm pretty to look at, so...

14:37.752 --> 14:39.170
- Thanks.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.554
- How about this one?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.681
Syd.
- Yeah?

14:50.681 --> 14:52.225
How about this?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.018
- It's fine.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.607
- You would have told me,
right?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.067
What?

15:02.401 --> 15:04.362
- If you knew he was
thinking about it.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.241
- Yeah.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.703
- I don't why I asked.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.673
Coco's friend--
that girl Michelle.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.466
Such a sweet girl.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.884
- She texted you again?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.803
- Yeah, she's hurting.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.472
I think she wants to be
close to us or something.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.726
Did you know
they were so close?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.688
- Sort of.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.357
- He left her a note.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.984
- What did it say?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.485
- A lot.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.613
He loved her.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.953
Are you in love with anyone?
- Ma.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.165
- 'Cause we can talk.
- No. Jesus, stop.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.589
- Everything's gonna get cold.
Did you tell her?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.966
- No it's--she knows.
- Should I go get her?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.634
No.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.685
- Why are there bags
in the hallway?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.104
- Uh, New Hampshire.
We're leaving in the morning.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.606
Remember?
- What?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.274
We're going
to the lake house.

16:23.274 --> 16:26.027
- It's been on the calendar
since the same time last year

16:26.027 --> 16:28.529
and the year before that
and the...

16:29.947 --> 16:32.325
- I can't go.
It's Conrad's funeral.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.744
I have to be there.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.829
Everyone would be wondering
where I am.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.123
- I'm sorry, Michelle, but
we're not postponing the trip

16:39.123 --> 16:40.666
so you can go to the funeral.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.460
It's the only time
your dad can get away.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.795
- Yeah.
- I don't care. I'm not going.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.889
I have to be there.

16:54.889 --> 16:58.184
I have to see his mom.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.896
- Honey, we don't even know
these people.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.565
I mean,
are they expecting you there?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.317
Were you invited?

17:06.317 --> 17:10.363
- Of course I was invited.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.366
I can't believe
you would even say that.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.554
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Roy.
- Thanks, Rob.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.681
Let us know
if you need anything.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.308
- I will.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.770
Riley.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.192
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Roy.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.779
I'm always here.
I know.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.407
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.798
- Mrs. Roy, I'm Gail Carter.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.718
Uh, I'm sorry--
so sorry for your loss.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.053
- Thank you.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.971
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.973
I don't know what I would do--
- Michelle?

19:22.453 --> 19:25.247
That kid was born
with the ocean in his blood.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.502
- In Florida, he told me
he was really proud

19:29.502 --> 19:31.837
to be part of a family
that had...

19:31.837 --> 19:35.049
such a strong legacy.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.385
- Hmm.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.388
His dad and him were...
- Yeah.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.475
- Florida.
That's where you guys met?

19:48.437 --> 19:51.482
- Rode bikes...

19:51.482 --> 19:53.901
walked along the beach.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.282
It was perfect.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.079
- I remember that trip.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.707
He came back happy.

20:11.085 --> 20:14.672
Strange that someone
so close to him

20:14.672 --> 20:16.590
and we never met.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.883
- Oh.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.802
Conrad was private.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.887
- Not with me.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.269
I didn't mean--

20:30.271 --> 20:32.523
Look at where we are.
Of course he was.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.319
It's just strange.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.532
It's all so strange.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.125
- I know I'm only 17.

20:53.711 --> 20:57.757
But I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with him.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.018
- Well, did he feel the same?

21:12.229 --> 21:15.149
- Wow.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.234
Just wow.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.911
- I miss him

21:26.911 --> 21:29.705
- Me too.

21:35.628 --> 21:39.298
He left you a note, sweetheart.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.052
- Oh. He did?
Can I read it?

21:43.052 --> 21:44.303
- Well, I didn't bring it here.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.763
I didn't think
it was appropriate.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.890
- No, no. Yeah, of course.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.600
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.520
Mrs. Roy, I'm gonna take off.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.896
- Okay. Thanks, Rob.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.235
Thanks for everything.
Of course.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.986
- Rob?

22:00.986 --> 22:03.656
- Yeah.
- This is Michelle Carter.

22:07.576 --> 22:11.664
- I really appreciate
your friendship with Conrad.

22:11.664 --> 22:15.167
He cared for you so much.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.002
- Uh, yeah.

22:17.002 --> 22:21.131
- And thank you for taking care
of the family and Lynn.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.592
It's been so difficult.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.637
- Sure.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.348
- Rob, maybe Michelle
could help you

22:29.348 --> 22:32.560
with the fundraiser
you were talking about?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.562
- Fundraiser?
- Uh, yeah.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.814
I was thinking of putting
something together for Coco,

22:36.814 --> 22:38.774
for, like, mental health
or something.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.195
If you wanted to help
put it together--

22:43.195 --> 22:44.822
- I would be honored.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.826
Okay, great.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.847
- We came here that day.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.266
Me, him, Syd, and Paige.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.937
It was good, really good.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.898
He laughed.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.858
- About what?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.654
- I don't remember.

24:17.706 --> 24:22.252
- I wasn't sure if you
wanted this back, but, uh...

24:22.252 --> 24:25.881
I took it
from his truck.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.259
It was hanging on the--
on the rearview mirror.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.261
I didn't want the cops
to fucking pocket it--

24:31.261 --> 24:33.681
First Communion cross and all.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.276
You think it was us?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.153
- What do you mean?

24:50.322 --> 24:53.325
- Was it our fault?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.577
- I don't want to talk
about it, Co.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.955
- I just meant--
- They told us to get him

24:57.955 --> 24:59.331
a shrink,
we get him a shrink.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.833
The shrink says,
"Get him some pills,"

25:00.833 --> 25:02.918
we get him some pills.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.294
What are we supposed to do?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.463
Chain him to
the fucking radiator?

25:06.463 --> 25:07.965
- Hey, let me walk you
to your car.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.299
Fuck off.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.988
- Hey, are you packed?

25:30.988 --> 25:33.365
- They spread his ashes
without me.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.992
- Sweetie, it was probably
just family.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.785
They weren't thinking
about you.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.246
- What?
Weren't thinking about me?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.957
- Michelle, I think you just
need to take a breath.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.625
- She left me out.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.336
I was the only one
that mattered to him,

25:46.336 --> 25:49.048
the only one who cared
about him.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.300
How can she do this?

26:04.146 --> 26:05.731
Michelle.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.982
Hi.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.069
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.197
So funny
seeing you guys here.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.409
- Oh, um...

26:17.409 --> 26:19.203
Here, sit.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.709
- So, anyway,
like I was saying--

26:25.709 --> 26:27.628
- Hey, didn't your boyfriend
just off himself?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.171
- Chris.
- Dude.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.006
- I'm--I'm so sorry
about him.

26:31.006 --> 26:34.176
He's acting like
an asshole tonight.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.762
- It's okay.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.806
It's life, right?

26:38.806 --> 26:40.349
- Not really.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.434
Ow, what the fuck?
Stop.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.144
What the fuck?

26:47.064 --> 26:49.399
- I'm just trying to be...

26:49.399 --> 26:53.278
grateful
for the time we had together.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.824
Conrad gave me a forever

26:56.824 --> 27:01.703
within the numbered days,
and I'm grateful.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.082
- Wow. That's deep.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.376
- Just the truth.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.795
BRAD You should be a writer.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.131
- Maybe.
- Right.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.924
'Cause you're up on your books
and shit.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.342
- Books and shit?
- Never seen you read

27:15.342 --> 27:16.593
a book a day in your life.

27:16.593 --> 27:17.886
Why do you have
to jump on my dick?

27:17.886 --> 27:19.012
I got low blood sugar,
and I'm hungry,

27:19.012 --> 27:20.180
so maybe that's why--

27:20.180 --> 27:22.391
- Hey.
If I did, like, a fundraiser,

27:22.391 --> 27:24.309
would you guys come?

27:24.309 --> 27:26.436
Oh, fundraiser
for what?

27:26.436 --> 27:28.272
- For Conrad.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.023
For, like, mental health.

27:30.023 --> 27:33.068
To raise awareness.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.113
We could do it here in town.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.533
Don't you think
you should do it in his town?

27:39.533 --> 27:41.451
Where's he from?

27:41.451 --> 27:43.871
- Mattapo--Mattapoisett?
- Mattapois-ey.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.539
- Where the hell is that?
- I've never heard of that.

27:45.539 --> 27:46.957
- By the water.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.709
- We could play, like,
a softball game or something.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.836
- Oh, like those celebrity
games they do for charity?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.629
- Yes. Yeah.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.381
Exactly.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.260
Would you guys
help me plan something?

27:58.260 --> 28:00.387
Sure.
Yeah, whatever you need.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.055
We could do it
at the high school.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.682
- Ooh, we can get,
like, matching shirts.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.143
We should put it on
Facebook. Maybe it'll go viral.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.729
Facebook?
You don't go viral on Facebook.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.899
You go viral on YouTube.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.984
- Hey, Rob.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.487
How you holding up?

28:17.487 --> 28:20.365
You guys were best friends,
right?

28:20.365 --> 28:21.742
- Yeah.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.328
Hey, look, um, listen,
I need you to do me a favor.

28:24.328 --> 28:27.080
Pretend like
I don't know anything,

28:27.080 --> 28:28.916
- Okay.

28:28.916 --> 28:32.127
- So when was the last time
you talked?

28:32.127 --> 28:34.880
- That day, Saturday. He, uh...

28:34.880 --> 28:37.299
he was supposed to come
see me at Fitchburg.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.675
Canceled at the last minute.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.762
- Give a reason?

28:41.762 --> 28:45.474
Did he ever talk about issues
with, uh, work? With girls?

28:45.474 --> 28:49.895
- No. But, I mean,
clearly he--he had issues.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.481
I mean, he tried before.

28:52.481 --> 28:56.610
- He attempted suicide?
- No one told you that?

28:58.153 --> 28:59.947
Yeah. Couple years back.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.159
- How, uh--how'd he try?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.956
- He took a bunch of Tylenol.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.874
He was in the hospital
for a bit.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.584
- Did he tell you why?

29:12.584 --> 29:13.961
- Not really.

29:13.961 --> 29:17.923
I mean, his parents' divorce
really screwed him up.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.341
You know, Mr. and Mrs. Roy

29:19.341 --> 29:22.427
constantly yelling,
not just at each other.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.930
- At Coco?
- Sometimes.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.723
You know how it is.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.938
- Michelle Carter. Know her?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.856
- Not really.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.942
- They were dating?

29:36.942 --> 29:40.195
- They only met up,
like, once or twice.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.781
She lived an hour away.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.616
Plainville, I think.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.077
- Do you know when they last
saw each other?

29:47.077 --> 29:49.079
- No. Why?

29:49.079 --> 29:51.957
- Well, she was all over
his social media.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.750
Thumbs up this, thumbs up that.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.836
You know, even posting
after he passed.

29:55.836 --> 29:59.214
- People will say anything
to get a like.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.807
- What do you girls want to do
when you get there?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.729
- We could go fishing.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.358
Michelle?

30:18.358 --> 30:20.193
What do you think about that?

30:21.486 --> 30:23.405
Go fishing with your dad.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.409
Michelle?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.246
- Can you turn that up?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.959


30:37.711 --> 30:39.171
- I can't believe
you like the song.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.714
Dad, turn it off.
- Shut up.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.382
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.134
Don't talk to your
sister that way, Michelle.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.761
- Just keep the song on, okay?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.815
- You know,
Conrad would have loved this.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.360
I always wanted him
to come on this trip with us.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.654
He loved the water.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.031
- Is that right?

31:07.699 --> 31:10.494
- He worked on the water,
he and his dad...

31:10.494 --> 31:12.621
tugboats.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.040
I wish
we could have met him.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.877
It seems you guys were close.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.004
- We were close.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.799
- Yeah, that's what I said.

31:23.799 --> 31:27.052
- No, you said "seems."

31:27.052 --> 31:29.012
- I'm just trying
to understand.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.972
You never talked about him.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.850
- So?

31:33.850 --> 31:37.020
- Sweetie, we never even
heard his name.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.288
- You okay?

31:56.540 --> 31:58.083
- No.

32:00.252 --> 32:04.047
- I'm sorry about before.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.882
About the song.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.303
- It just reminded me of him.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.183
- I didn't know you guys
were in love.

32:15.183 --> 32:19.229
- He was the greatest guy
I've ever met.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.316
He told me everything.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.819
And I could tell him
everything.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.532
You know, when people talk
about star-crossed lovers

32:30.532 --> 32:31.700
and things like that?

32:31.700 --> 32:33.118
Well, that's what it was.

32:35.537 --> 32:39.332
The moment we met,
it was just...magic,

32:39.332 --> 32:42.210
like I'd known him
my whole life.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.796
- Wow.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.573
- We've been talking,
and...

33:11.573 --> 33:15.368
your father and I think you
should see the doctor again.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.495
- Why?
- It's just--

33:17.495 --> 33:21.666
it feels a little too similar
to last time.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.460
- That's not true.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.962
- The sulking, the yelling.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.256
- I'm grieving, Mom.

33:31.134 --> 33:34.137
- Remember how much better
you felt after?

33:35.555 --> 33:38.099
It could help.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.977
He could prescribe you
some new meds.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.729
- I'm taking the pills.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.606
What else do you want me to do?

33:44.606 --> 33:47.108
- You could talk to me.
You could talk to your dad.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.194
- You wouldn't get it.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.407
Is that it?

34:06.002 --> 34:08.546
- Oh, goal!

34:08.546 --> 34:10.382
- Nice shot.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.343
Sorry to bust up the game.
Figured you'd want these ASAP.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.220
- That's the extraction?

34:15.220 --> 34:17.347
- Two of eight.

34:17.347 --> 34:20.308
- Jesus Christ.
This is just him and the girl?

34:20.308 --> 34:22.644
- Ask and you shall receive.

34:22.644 --> 34:24.896
Got some cinema in there, too,
tablet on top.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.439
I'll grab the rest.

34:26.439 --> 34:29.192
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.659
- Dad.

34:57.178 --> 35:00.849
<i>- Hi, this is</i>
<i>Conrad Henry Roy III,</i>

35:00.849 --> 35:03.393
<i>reporting to you</i>
<i>about what's been going</i>

35:03.393 --> 35:06.354
<i>through my mind</i>
<i>the past few weeks.</i>

35:06.354 --> 35:10.859
I can't fathom that I was such
a happy kid when I was younger.

35:12.652 --> 35:16.197
<i>I know, I know, I know.</i>
<i>A lot of people tell me.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:20.660
<i>A lot of people tell me that</i>
<i>I have a lot going for me.</i>

35:20.660 --> 35:24.831
I have to be happy.
I have to be happy.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.917
Well, no, you don't
have to be happy.

35:27.917 --> 35:32.339
<i>I think I just need to relax.</i>

35:32.339 --> 35:34.883
<i>I really do,</i>

35:34.883 --> 35:38.720
'cause I just keep thinking
about the past.

35:38.720 --> 35:43.016
This kid having trouble...

35:43.016 --> 35:44.643
talking at the lunch table,

35:44.643 --> 35:48.772
having trouble communicating,
having trouble...

35:48.772 --> 35:50.440
<i>Struggling.</i>

35:52.484 --> 35:54.486
Social anxiety to me

35:54.486 --> 35:57.697
is the inability
to function properly

35:57.697 --> 36:01.618
in a manner that you want to
in a social situation.

36:01.618 --> 36:06.081
<i>Not all eyes are on you</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

36:06.081 --> 36:10.085
<i>People understand</i>
<i>that's just who you are.</i>

36:10.085 --> 36:13.463
You don't have to be
this amazing...

36:13.463 --> 36:15.256
drawn-out,

36:15.256 --> 36:17.842
thought-out superhero...

36:17.842 --> 36:21.680
<i>Incredible Hulk or Superman.</i>

36:21.680 --> 36:23.932
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:23.932 --> 36:27.185
<i>But if I keep talking,</i>
<i>if I just keep talking,</i>

36:27.185 --> 36:30.105
then it's gonna get better.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.487
<i>Racing thoughts,</i>
<i>suicidal thoughts.</i>

36:39.823 --> 36:44.327
<i>What I'm doing is looking</i>
<i>at myself so negatively.</i>

36:45.495 --> 36:48.164
Never be successful.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.917
Never have a wife.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.086
Never have kids.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.755
Comes to a point
where I'm just...

37:00.635 --> 37:02.887
<i>Too nice.</i>

37:17.944 --> 37:21.990
- I loved him, and he loved me,

37:21.990 --> 37:23.366
and...

37:25.201 --> 37:27.370
He loved all of you guys.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.707
I know he did.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.546
I like to sing in the car,
and, um...

37:38.757 --> 37:41.801
Before Finn,
I used to sing alone.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.766
And this was
the, uh, first song

37:47.766 --> 37:49.934
that we would sing together

37:49.934 --> 37:53.354
when we would drive
around together.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.660
<i>- Song that I...</i>
<i>Sang with him</i>

38:07.660 --> 38:10.413
<i>when we would drive</i>
<i>around together, so...</i>

38:12.874 --> 38:15.376
<i>Nobody treat me with...</i>
Kid gloves, okay?

38:17.796 --> 38:20.006
I don't know
what to say either.

38:24.385 --> 38:27.806
I loved Finn, and...

38:27.806 --> 38:30.183
and he loved me.

38:30.183 --> 38:33.186
He loved all of you guys.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.146
I know he did.

38:37.857 --> 38:41.027
I like to sing in the car,
and, um...

38:41.027 --> 38:44.739
Before Finn,
I used to sing alone.

38:47.283 --> 38:51.538
This was the first song
that I sang with him

38:51.538 --> 38:53.581
when we would drive
around together.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.291
So...

38:55.291 --> 38:57.043
this is for him.
