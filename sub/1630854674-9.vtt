00:01.566 --> 00:02.959
<i>Previously on</i> Will Trent...

00:02.959 --> 00:04.482
No! What the hell's your
boyfriend doing here, huh?

00:04.482 --> 00:06.223
What, did you chase
the ambulance here, Trent?

00:06.223 --> 00:08.486
You know how I said
I grew up in a group home?

00:08.486 --> 00:09.574
Will was there.

00:09.574 --> 00:10.662
We could go to the cops.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.055
They won't do anything.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.578
He walked into your room
in the middle of the night

00:13.578 --> 00:14.884
and raped you.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.320
Are you worried
I'm gonna start using again?

00:16.320 --> 00:17.974
Angie,
I know all of you.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.802
How about the next time
you want to run,

00:19.802 --> 00:21.456
give it 24 hours.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.631
See if it passes.

00:22.631 --> 00:23.762
Okay.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.647
Been waiting a long time
for today.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.649
Hopefully, we can
all finally move on.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.954
No matter
what LaPorte gets,

00:41.954 --> 00:43.304
it won't make up
for what he did.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.790
Now fry, cop killer!

00:51.790 --> 00:53.314
Enjoy Hell, LaPorte.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.490
Andrew Hollis was my friend!

01:01.061 --> 01:02.758
Come on.
It's the cuffs.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.848
Look at this place.
We gotta keep moving.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.031
I love your outfit.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.555
Thank you.
It's my favorite.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.209
Not used to the shoes,
yet, though.

01:19.209 --> 01:20.428
Ouch.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.516
Are you a lawyer?

01:21.516 --> 01:22.560
Oh, God, no.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.519
Um... GBI.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.651
But with how often
I testify here,

01:26.651 --> 01:28.479
I might as well have
my own parking spot.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.655
But it is hopping
in here today, huh?

01:32.657 --> 01:34.224
Were those gunshots?

01:34.224 --> 01:35.399
We're gonna be
all right, okay?

01:35.399 --> 01:37.358
Just breathe.
What's your name again?

01:37.358 --> 01:39.011
- Bonnie.
- Bonnie, I'm Faith.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.100
We're gonna be okay.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.063
No service. Of course.

01:47.063 --> 01:51.023
My daughter. She's--
She's in the court.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.069
I'm a mom, too.
I get it.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.941
But stay calm, okay?

02:05.603 --> 02:07.779
Where's the kind
we usually get, Betty?

02:07.779 --> 02:09.346
<i>♪ Doesn't take much
to make me happy ♪</i>

02:09.346 --> 02:10.869
They must have moved
things around.

02:10.869 --> 02:15.047
<i>♪ And make me smile with glee ♪</i>

02:15.047 --> 02:18.138
<i>♪ Never, never will
I feel discouraged ♪</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:19.661
We need these.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.141
<i>♪ 'Cause our love's no mystery ♪</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:24.100
Can we get the regular kind
instead of whole wheat?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.058
Sure, yeah.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.887
If that, uh, works for you.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.326
Hey...

02:32.326 --> 02:33.936
That's bad bitch Betty!

02:33.936 --> 02:35.111
What did you just call her?

02:35.111 --> 02:36.852
That is bad bitch Betty, right?

02:36.852 --> 02:39.333
<i>♪ Want the whole wide world
to see ♪</i>

02:39.333 --> 02:42.945
Listen, I'm not sorry.
Betty is very popular

02:42.945 --> 02:44.207
on the socials.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.470
You didn't even bother
to ask, huh?

02:46.470 --> 02:49.560
This is Trent.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.606
<i>♪ You've got the best
of my love ♪</i>

02:51.606 --> 02:52.824
Courthouse?

02:53.869 --> 02:55.566
Isn't Faith there today?

02:57.307 --> 03:00.528
Yeah, okay, I'm just a--
a block south.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.573
All right, I'm on my way.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.314
All right, look, um...

03:05.576 --> 03:07.491
Don't do anything stupid,

03:07.491 --> 03:09.145
all right?

03:09.145 --> 03:12.322
<i>♪ Oh, oh, you've got
the best of my love ♪</i>

03:14.803 --> 03:16.500
Get those civilians
out of here.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.502
Take them to
the Clerk's office.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.288
Oh, fantastic.
It's the second responders.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.159
You're welcome.
Will Trent, GBI.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.640
- Here to assist.
- Tate Grillo, APD.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.337
Uh, ground floor's secured.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.992
No reported injuries yet,
but we believe

03:29.992 --> 03:32.037
LaPorte stole a pistol
from security.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.691
This courthouse has 14 exits.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.693
Six have security blind spots.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.999
Foster kid.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.479
Spent a lot of time
in this building.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.481
Let's put
that knowledge to use.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.699
Sam LaPorte's smart.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.310
He knows how
to get people to trust him,

03:43.310 --> 03:45.921
but make no mistake,
he's a cold-blooded killer.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.053
You know a lot
about our fugitive.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.272
He killed my partner.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.013
Then let's find him.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.328
Excuse me.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.894
- I said excuse me.
- Hey, don't even--

04:02.894 --> 04:04.156
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

04:04.156 --> 04:06.289
Shut up! Shut up!

04:06.289 --> 04:08.030
Keep breathing, Bonnie.
We're okay.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.727
Come here.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.381
Get over here.
I said don't move.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.514
Please, please.
Look, she didn't do anything.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.647
Look,
I'm Faith Mitchell.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.693
I'm with the GBI,
and I can help you.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.478
Faith Mitchell?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.089
You don't say.
Okay, look.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.917
Put your gun on the ground
and kick it over there.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.529
Slowly.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.012
Look, if you pull
that trigger,

04:34.012 --> 04:36.406
everyone will know
exactly where you are.

04:36.406 --> 04:39.366
Move! Move!

04:41.498 --> 04:44.109
It's up here, on the left.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.243
Put your hands
on your head!

04:47.243 --> 04:49.506
Where is he?

04:50.377 --> 04:54.076
He was gonna kill me,
but she

04:54.076 --> 04:55.556
Who?

04:55.556 --> 04:57.775
Who were you with?

04:57.775 --> 04:59.168
She...

05:00.212 --> 05:01.779
Is this hers?

05:08.177 --> 05:09.178
Where is she?

05:09.178 --> 05:11.746
He took her.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.356
And my car keys.

05:14.444 --> 05:18.970
Ormewood, tell dispatch that
LaPorte is armed and dangerous.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.321
And he's taken
Faith Mitchell hostage.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.508
Slow down.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.858
We don't need any
unnecessary attention.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.301
I have a son. Jeremy.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.955
He's a freshman
at A.C. Tech.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.698
Look, I love that kid.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.657
So I will drive you
to the end of this world

05:53.657 --> 05:55.746
if that means that
I'll see him again.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.579
I'm diabetic,

06:02.579 --> 06:04.581
and I left my kit
at the courthouse,

06:04.581 --> 06:06.496
so if we're gonna
do that,

06:06.496 --> 06:09.107
then we need
to stop for medicine.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.241
Keep straight.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.418
Where are we going?

06:21.511 --> 06:23.731
FAITH [muffled]: Help!

06:23.731 --> 06:25.428
Help!

06:29.171 --> 06:33.088
Help!

06:33.088 --> 06:35.743
Oh, are you there, God?

06:35.743 --> 06:37.048
Oh.

06:37.048 --> 06:40.182
It's me-- Faith.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.749
Dumb joke. Sorry.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.011
Okay.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.187
I'm in a bit of a jam right now.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.754
Maybe you noticed.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.500
Okay, okay.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.284
Relax, relax.

06:55.284 --> 06:59.201
Come on. Yes.

06:59.201 --> 07:03.248
Breathe [groans] space
into the joints...

07:04.249 --> 07:05.990
...through the spine.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.123
Lengthen the arms.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.604
Tighten the core.

07:10.604 --> 07:11.822
Oh, my God!

07:11.822 --> 07:13.824
Why don't we do this
in hot yoga?

07:15.783 --> 07:17.437
Sorry, God. I'm back.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.264
Listen, I need help.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.659
Please don't let
this be my time.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.313
I need to be here for Jeremy.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.275
Please, please, please, please!

07:30.275 --> 07:31.886
Aah!

07:33.365 --> 07:34.758
Thank you, God.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.935
Thank you,
Shanti from hot yoga.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.937
Now please don't let
this latch be broken.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.859
You're under arrest!

07:48.859 --> 07:52.297
Once again, my name is
Special Agent Faith Mitchell,

07:52.297 --> 07:54.082
and I'm with the GBI.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.737
Obviously, I know how
to get out of a trunk.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.393
This is not
what we discussed!

08:01.393 --> 08:03.091
I went in there
and got meds for you.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.875
It was a nice gesture!

08:04.875 --> 08:06.268
Where you going? Where you
going? Where you going?

08:06.268 --> 08:07.530
We're switching cars.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.923
Come on.

08:08.923 --> 08:12.100
Stay right there.
Do not move.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.553
Help!

08:32.729 --> 08:34.252
All right, listen up.

08:34.252 --> 08:37.865
Sam LaPorte has stolen
a black Ford F-150.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.694
APD is patrolling
his previous addresses.

08:40.694 --> 08:44.262
They got a half an hour on us,
but we will find that truck.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.700
Let's go! Be safe!

08:51.095 --> 08:54.403
I got a bad feeling about this
angry mob of trigger-happy cops.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.709
Yeah. Me, too.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.058
We'll find her,

08:57.058 --> 08:59.234
but chasing that truck's
a fool's errand.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.453
It's one of the most
common vehicles in Georgia.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.672
And even if we got lucky

09:02.672 --> 09:05.370
and found the one
LaPorte stole,

09:05.370 --> 09:07.764
a high-speed pursuit
only puts Faith in danger.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.505
And you have
a better idea?

09:09.505 --> 09:12.290
The pharmacist confirmed
that LaPorte stole insulin.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.597
He plans on keeping Faith alive,
at least for now.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.729
The best way
to catch this guy

09:15.729 --> 09:17.121
is by getting one step
ahead of him.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.601
Well, how do you plan
on doing that?

09:18.601 --> 09:20.516
Well, learning about him,
not the crime.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.040
If I wanted to drive in circles,
I'd rent a go-kart.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.787
So this is
his mom's place, huh?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.572
Yeah,
for the last six years.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.139
Now we just wait and hope
the prick comes home.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.880
I didn't know
Andrew Hollis well.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.056
You guys were close?

09:39.056 --> 09:40.841
Yeah, he was in my class
at the Academy.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.234
Great guy,
frickin' genius.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.888
Probably would have
made Captain.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.674
And then he hired LaPorte.

09:47.674 --> 09:52.200
Gave an ex-con a chance,
and look what happened.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.984
Can't trust anybody.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.900
I can't believe
he got Mitchell.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.641
Will must be
losing his mind.

09:58.641 --> 09:59.860
Oh, Mr. Spock?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.078
Yeah, I bet
if Mitchell dies,

10:01.078 --> 10:02.297
it'll probably ruin
his whole afternoon.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.212
Knock it off.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.366
That's him.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.455
No way. Where?

10:31.935 --> 10:33.633
No, uh--

10:33.633 --> 10:35.069
Never mind.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.289
It was somebody else.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.118
What's going on with you?

10:41.118 --> 10:42.424
I'm fine.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.041
Go.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.390
Okay, I'm not taking
another step

10:52.390 --> 10:54.392
until you tell me
where we're going.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.004
In there, in my friend
Glen's house.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.309
No. No.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.703
- Help! Help! Help!
- Stop. Stop! Listen to me!

11:00.703 --> 11:02.400
I'm innocent!
Ow!

11:02.400 --> 11:03.706
He says to the woman
he just kidnapped

11:03.706 --> 11:04.968
in front of the truck
he stole.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.188
I swear, I did not kill
Andrew Hollis.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.538
The night of the crime, I was
in there with my friend, Glen.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.235
He can prove it, and then
you can just clear my name.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.716
You have to see the irony
in threatening to kill me

11:13.716 --> 11:16.501
unless I convince people
you're not a killer, right?

11:16.501 --> 11:17.894
Well, I don't have
any other options.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.462
Now, move.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.595
Glen?

11:23.595 --> 11:25.162
Buddy?

11:27.730 --> 11:29.819
Oh, God.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.647
He's in here!

11:33.649 --> 11:36.217
Sam, call an ambulance!

11:36.217 --> 11:37.305
It's on its way.

11:39.786 --> 11:40.917
Thank God.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.005
He's still got a pulse.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.050
Suspect's armed.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.747
He's upstairs.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.012
I found your gun.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.754
This is Officer Grillo.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.452
I'm at 64 Hawthorne Street.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.499
I got one dead on arrival--
Glen Donato.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.067
Shooter is
GBI Agent Faith Mitchell.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.156
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- What are you doing?

12:02.156 --> 12:04.941
It's you.
You did this to me.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.466
Sam LaPorte's been located.

12:08.466 --> 12:09.772
He and Mitchell
are working together.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.513
I need backup.
Now!

12:11.513 --> 12:12.819
I need backup!

12:14.472 --> 12:16.083
<i>♪ Shake it up, shake it up ♪</i>

12:18.302 --> 12:20.783
<i>♪ I just got paid ♪</i>

12:24.439 --> 12:28.791
<i>♪ I'm feelin',
I'm feelin' nice ♪</i>

12:28.791 --> 12:32.142
-<i>♪ Just got paid, Friday night ♪</i>
- Did you kill him?

12:32.142 --> 12:33.753
<i>Backup is on their way.</i>

12:33.753 --> 12:35.537
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

12:35.537 --> 12:37.626
<i>Faith Mitchell and Sam LaPorte
are armed and dangerous.</i>

12:37.626 --> 12:39.280
- Okay, we need to go now.
- No, no.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.803
We need to stay and explain.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.545
Faith! They're going to
shoot us. We gotta go.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.765
- Come on.
-<i>♪ I'm gettin' down ♪</i>

12:45.765 --> 12:48.071
<i>♪ Just got paid,
just got paid ♪</i>

12:48.811 --> 12:52.772
<i>This is Officer Grillo.
I'm at 64 Hawthorne Street.</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:55.470
<i>I got one dead on arrival--
Glen Donato.</i>

12:55.470 --> 12:58.168
<i>Shooter is
GBI Agent Faith Mitchell.</i>

12:58.168 --> 12:59.648
That's it?

12:59.648 --> 13:01.128
That doesn't prove anything.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.521
Ballistics matched the casings
to Mitchell's handgun.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.567
And her coat was found
at the scene of the crime.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.960
That's hard evidence.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.875
Faith's never pulled the trigger
on the job before.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.007
There were scuff marks
from Faith's shoes

13:11.007 --> 13:12.530
in the trunk of the sedan.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.619
- She was kidnapped.
- She's your partner.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.318
I should pull you from the case
based on your bias alone.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.102
Oh, assign someone worse.
Be my guest.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.191
Director Armstrong,
this isn't

13:21.191 --> 13:22.323
the Faith Mitchell
any of us know.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.672
The two have history.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.153
She arrested LaPorte for
burglary seven years ago.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.112
And it pisses me off that I had
to hear that from someone else.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.985
I need LaPorte and Mitchell
in custody A.S.A.P.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.551
And if the two of you
aren't up to it,

13:33.551 --> 13:35.597
I'll find someone who is.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.346
- We need a plan.
- Shut up.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.130
I need to think.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.481
I need to get a message
to my partner.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.657
- Can we call him?
- With what phone?

13:52.657 --> 13:55.269
I may have killed
an innocent,

13:55.269 --> 13:57.184
highly-decorated
police officer.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.881
You're a convicted murderer.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.492
Even if I could call Will, APD
has already tapped his phone.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.668
They've already tapped
everybody's phone.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.453
<i>We got a manhunt!</i>

14:05.453 --> 14:06.976
<i>Earlier today, Sam LaPorte,</i>

14:06.976 --> 14:09.109
<i>convicted of killing
Officer Andrew Hollis,</i>

14:09.109 --> 14:10.937
<i>escaped from APD custody</i>

14:10.937 --> 14:13.678
<i>with the help of
GBI Agent Faith Mitchell.</i>

14:13.678 --> 14:15.637
<i>Devious!</i>

14:15.637 --> 14:17.682
<i>They were last seen
driving a black F-150.</i>

14:17.682 --> 14:20.729
<i>Do with that what you will, snitches.</i>

14:26.169 --> 14:28.519
Okay, you did not
kill Andrew Hollis.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.304
- I know.
- He kept Glen from testifying

14:30.304 --> 14:31.696
and killed him
after you escaped.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.784
- I know.
- You were framed.

14:32.784 --> 14:33.960
Yeah, I said that
a few times, too.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.050
We need to find a place
to lay low.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.400
We're gonna get through this Together.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.924
Okay. Well, you do know
what they say.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.447
There are two I's
in "fugitive."

14:43.447 --> 14:45.232
Yeah, there's also
an F and a U.

14:55.503 --> 14:58.158
All right, we're just south
of some cabins I know about.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.594
They should be empty
this time of year.

14:59.594 --> 15:00.725
Where are you going?

15:00.725 --> 15:01.901
To get a lottery ticket.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.947
The bathroom.
I'll be quick.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.906
Okay, can you uncuff me
first, please?

15:28.405 --> 15:30.103
Be right back, okay?

15:46.162 --> 15:48.034
Hey, there.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.996
I know, I know.
I look a mess.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.476
I'm having a bad day.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.260
Hey, what do you do
when you have bad days?

15:57.260 --> 15:58.740
Eat candy.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.481
Yeah, well,
when I have bad days,

16:00.481 --> 16:02.135
I like to look
at pictures of puppies.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.485
You know, my friend has
a really cute dog.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.269
You wanna see?

16:13.450 --> 16:14.974
Hey, Nico.
It's Faith.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.932
Tell Will that I'm safe
and I did not kill anyone

16:16.932 --> 16:19.587
and I left my gun
at the courthouse.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.023
Hey!

16:21.763 --> 16:23.286
Start the truck,
start the truck.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.809
You okay?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.463
What were you doing
with my son?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.859
I'm gonna call the police!

16:33.601 --> 16:34.602
Thank you, Patrick.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.083
Nine months is a big deal.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.563
Keep it up, brother.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.131
Would anyone else
like to share?

16:42.131 --> 16:44.568
I would, please.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.005
The floor is yours.

16:47.745 --> 16:48.920
Uh, hi, I'm Angie.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.010
I'm an alcoholic,
a drug addict,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.837
and a Sagittarius.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.014
Hi, Angie.

16:55.014 --> 16:59.235
I am 81 days sober, and...

16:59.235 --> 17:00.932
today's a rough one.

17:02.934 --> 17:07.852
I saw someone today that I hoped
I would never see again,

17:07.852 --> 17:12.509
and now I feel powerless
and, uh,

17:12.509 --> 17:14.468
I feel exactly like
I did the last time I saw him

17:14.468 --> 17:16.078
when I was 15.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.733
Uh, my colleague is...

17:20.213 --> 17:21.605
She's been kidnapped,

17:21.605 --> 17:22.998
and I'm supposed to be
out there looking for her,

17:22.998 --> 17:24.608
and all I can think of is...

17:26.654 --> 17:28.221
Oh, man.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.570
It was so much more fun
telling y'all

17:29.570 --> 17:32.007
about when I got kicked
out of the aquarium.

17:35.358 --> 17:38.840
That man I saw today

17:38.840 --> 17:41.495
was supposed to protect me

17:41.495 --> 17:44.063
because I was a kid.

17:45.194 --> 17:50.547
But he always said he'd rather
treat me as a woman instead.

17:50.547 --> 17:56.336
And I just wish I could forget
that scumbag existed,

17:56.336 --> 17:59.121
but he's back.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.560
Oh, my partner's calling me
non-stop,

18:03.560 --> 18:05.736
and I feel like I'm getting
pulled in a million directions.

18:05.736 --> 18:09.653
But the fact that I'm here
right now means, uh,

18:09.653 --> 18:13.135
in this moment, at least...

18:13.135 --> 18:14.702
I'm in control.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.758
Faith Mitchell.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.760
I can't believe it.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.546
I guess she and LaPorte
had a thing.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.157
Glen was dead
when you arrived?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.377
Who tried
to stop the bleeding?

18:37.377 --> 18:38.508
What?

18:38.508 --> 18:40.728
The pillow.
That bloodstain pattern.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.339
He must've rolled onto it.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.211
Who the hell
let you in here, anyway?

18:45.211 --> 18:46.951
My partner's still missing,
and the door was open.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.563
Your partner tried
to kill me.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.738
Why didn't she?

18:50.738 --> 18:52.218
What's that supposed
to mean?

18:52.218 --> 18:53.828
She killed Glen, right?

18:53.828 --> 18:55.438
You arrived on the scene.

18:55.438 --> 18:56.613
Why didn't she
kill you, too?

18:56.613 --> 18:59.486
- Enough.
- Look, where's Angie?

18:59.486 --> 19:00.661
She had an appointment.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.184
What's more important
than this?

19:02.184 --> 19:04.012
Look, I'm not keeping tabs
on your girlfriend for you,

19:04.012 --> 19:05.187
Trent, all right?
I got this.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.667
What happened
to your neck, Tate?

19:06.667 --> 19:09.017
Oh, this?

19:09.017 --> 19:10.149
Faith strangled me.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.324
With what?

19:11.324 --> 19:12.673
Those look
like ligature marks.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.850
You know, this
homicide case is APD.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.548
GBI was just asked
to help assist in the manhunt.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.507
You're out of
your jurisdiction, Trent.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.725
Again.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.336
I'll walk you out.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.343
Glen's car cost more
than everything in his house.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.735
Wonder how
he afforded that.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.128
You should look
into the VIN.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.043
Oh, I don't need you
to tell me how to do my job.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.392
Are you sure?

19:36.392 --> 19:38.351
Because that crime scene's
busted. It's staged.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.223
And either you're bad at your
job, or you're in on it, too.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.442
In on what?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.183
It's not your case, Trent,
so let it go!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.750
My partner's being framed
for murder! I can't let it go!

19:46.750 --> 19:49.057
Then don't let it go--
someplace else.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.885
Look, I can't explain
those bullet casings,

19:50.885 --> 19:52.191
but if Faith really
shot Glen,

19:52.191 --> 19:53.801
why didn't she use
the same gun on Tate, too?

19:53.801 --> 19:55.846
Think about it.
His neck.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.458
Those are ligature marks.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.068
Faith had handcuffs on.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.811
That's a lot
of leaps, Trent.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.856
I'm going back inside.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.467
That bloody pillow
says everything.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.251
Thanks for the input.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.564
Yeah.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.913
<i>Faith used someone's phone</i>

20:18.913 --> 20:21.394
<i>to send Betty
a message on the 'gram.</i>

20:22.699 --> 20:24.440
Smart.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.355
<i>She says she's safe
and she didn't kill anyone,</i>

20:26.355 --> 20:28.662
<i>and she left her gun
at the courthouse.</i>

20:28.662 --> 20:30.272
<i>Does that make sense
to you?</i>

20:30.272 --> 20:31.317
Yes.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.883
Yes, it does.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.196
We're here. See?

20:41.196 --> 20:43.067
- Now, that wasn't so bad.
- Okay, let me down.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.636
How about a thank you for
carrying you through the woods?

20:46.636 --> 20:49.204
Oh, how about thank you
for saving your life?

20:49.204 --> 20:50.640
You know what?

20:50.640 --> 20:53.556
You might not be a murderer,
but you are an idiot.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.387
And you're my prisoner.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.999
I mean, girl,
those socks are wild.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.218
Oh, you think it's funny

21:03.218 --> 21:04.915
that I lost my shoes
and my favorite coat

21:04.915 --> 21:07.004
while being held hostage
at gunpoint?

21:07.004 --> 21:08.919
Most comedians
have a tight five,

21:08.919 --> 21:11.095
but you-- you got
a tight 25 to life.

21:11.095 --> 21:13.576
- Sam, sit.
- That was a good one.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.104
You really don't
remember me, huh?

21:21.802 --> 21:24.370
Okay, May 11, 2016.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.589
I was at a Best Buy...

21:26.589 --> 21:27.721
unlawfully.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.724
Come on.
You arrested me.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.423
- Maybe.
- No, I'm telling you.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.253
How many times
have you been arrested?

21:39.776 --> 21:40.995
Cool.
Whatever that number is,

21:40.995 --> 21:42.997
there have been weeks
where I did triple.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.521
Well, you were kind.
I never forgot it.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.827
Yeah, well, the next time
you wanna say thanks,

21:46.827 --> 21:50.874
just [sighs] send flowers.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.446
Hey, what do you know
about that fridge?

21:58.882 --> 22:00.580
- Nothing.
- Good answer.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.755
Follow me.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.455
What's left of my
favorite outfit is ruined,

22:06.455 --> 22:08.239
so I'm gonna
take a shower.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.853
And when I get back,
I want you to tell me

22:12.853 --> 22:16.596
everything there is to know
about this fridge.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.467
- Seriously?
- Mm.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.121
This is so messed up.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.688
Yep.

22:21.688 --> 22:22.993
Thanks for saving my life.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.560
Thanks for ruining mine!

22:56.810 --> 23:00.248
I need all the security footage
from the courthouse.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.032
Well, where the hell is it?

23:03.338 --> 23:05.253
I'll call you back.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.690
I had a BPA expert
check the pillow.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.039
Transfer stains.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.519
Faith must have held it
against Glen's chest

23:10.519 --> 23:11.520
to stop the bleeding.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.043
You were right.

23:17.221 --> 23:19.136
I set a meeting
with Andrew Hollis' widow

23:19.136 --> 23:20.877
at my house.

23:20.877 --> 23:21.922
You coming?

23:21.922 --> 23:23.750
Yeah.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.016
Please, come in.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.455
No, no.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.500
- This was a mistake.
- Mrs. Hollis.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.067
- Maia.
- Don't you dare.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.242
Like we're old friends.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.548
Mrs. Hollis.

23:39.548 --> 23:42.551
Maia, we have questions
about Andrew's murder.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.466
Where were you
when I found my husband's body?

23:44.466 --> 23:46.512
When that maniac...

23:49.732 --> 23:50.864
Do you have any whiskey?

23:50.864 --> 23:53.693
I'm afraid
this is a dry house.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.869
That's just great.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.448
Do you think Sam LaPorte
killed your husband?

24:12.146 --> 24:14.627
Andrew liked him.

24:14.627 --> 24:17.238
Wanted to give an ex-con
doing right a leg up.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.458
Why didn't you testify?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.330
My testimony
was not needed.

24:22.330 --> 24:26.639
Tate was the tragic hero
in search for justice.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.510
No one cared about me.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.425
- That's not true.
- Oh, please.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.253
You dropped off a casserole
and disappeared.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.733
Tate ran the investigation.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.082
I asked how you were doing constantly,

24:35.082 --> 24:36.649
and he said you didn't want
to see any of us.

24:36.649 --> 24:41.436
Officer Grillo was
keeping you isolated.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.264
He controlled the narrative.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.527
I couldn't talk to anyone
without him by my side.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.747
Snooped around my house
all hours of the night.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.270
I swear he had
my phone tapped.

24:49.270 --> 24:52.099
Do you have any idea
what Tate was looking for?

24:54.971 --> 24:56.582
I can't. I'm sorry.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.888
Look, I understand
that you're scared.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.542
All right,
but what you know

25:00.542 --> 25:02.631
might help save
someone else's life.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.114
My husband was an honest cop.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.768
He knew Tate wasn't.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.726
He suspected he was
stealing evidence.

25:10.726 --> 25:14.338
He knew Internal Affairs
wouldn't listen without proof.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.907
So he started
to put together a file.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.866
Do you know
where that file is?

25:19.866 --> 25:21.694
I looked everywhere.

25:21.694 --> 25:22.912
I never found it.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.218
Was there anything else
going on

25:24.218 --> 25:25.567
around the time
of Andrew's murder?

25:27.395 --> 25:29.658
Andrew planted
a bunch of bamboo,

25:29.658 --> 25:31.181
and I didn't like it.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.662
So he finally agreed
to change the backyard.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.708
Two weeks into the job,
he was murdered.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.406
Would it be possible for me to
take a look around your house?

25:38.406 --> 25:40.582
I moved after he passed.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.279
Too many memories.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.719
Andrew was right
about Tate.

25:46.719 --> 25:49.983
But he's not just a bad cop.
He's a sociopath.

26:06.303 --> 26:07.696
Sam?

26:09.916 --> 26:11.570
Sam!

26:13.876 --> 26:15.138
Sam!

26:16.444 --> 26:17.706
What the hell
are you doing?

26:17.706 --> 26:20.535
Sam LaPorte, you are
a fugitive from the law.

26:20.535 --> 26:21.754
Put your hands up
or I will shoot.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.105
One more move
and your head will be next.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.585
Wow, that was
a good shot.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.892
- Put your face on the floor!
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.067
Go!

26:32.982 --> 26:34.941
What happened to there
being two I's in fugitive?

26:34.941 --> 26:37.857
My fate relies on your partner
checking his doggy DMs.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.642
And while I'd love to put
my faith in law enforcement,

26:40.642 --> 26:42.339
I think that ship
has sailed.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.732
Look, we need to move.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.429
All right, I got some friends
in North Carolina.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.909
They-- They can get us
some passports.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.781
Just get a grip, man.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.130
Will needs time
to do his job,

26:50.130 --> 26:52.741
and you're my prisoner--
my responsibility.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.264
And we're gonna live
through this.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.701
- You just tried to shoot me.
- And whose fault is that?

26:55.701 --> 26:59.313
As of right now, assigning blame
is a little complicated.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.231
We only had
two bullets left, dummy.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.809
Hey, uh, any update
on Mitchell?

27:16.809 --> 27:18.593
Nothing solid.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.900
What's going on?
Where have you been?

27:20.900 --> 27:22.249
Um, can you do me a favor?

27:22.249 --> 27:23.859
Can you verify that
that's the current address

27:23.859 --> 27:25.513
for Lenny Broussard?

27:25.513 --> 27:27.341
Run it yourself.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.777
Please?

27:29.778 --> 27:31.084
I can't have
my name on it.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.783
What'd this Lenny guy
do to you?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.047
I was in his foster care
for a little--

27:38.047 --> 27:42.182
It wasn't great.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.314
Must've paroled
and no one told me.

27:51.539 --> 27:52.888
<i>But last night,
I was with my friend Glen.</i>

27:55.586 --> 27:56.892
<i>Okay, look.</i>

27:56.892 --> 27:58.981
<i>We got into an argument
when I tried</i>

27:58.981 --> 28:00.635
<i>to replace some bamboo
with some rose bushes,</i>

28:00.635 --> 28:02.245
<i>but listen, I--
I get it.</i>

28:02.245 --> 28:04.073
<i>I mean, it's his money,
his house.</i>

28:05.205 --> 28:07.250
Jeremy.
What are you doing here?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.339
Police brought me in
for questioning.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.082
- Do you really think that--
- No, I don't.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.388
Well, what if
something's wrong--

28:14.388 --> 28:17.130
Jeremy, listen to me.
We're gonna get her back.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.741
I told you
to wait in my office.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.179
And the pizza's here.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.097
Any ideas?

28:28.097 --> 28:29.446
Yeah.

28:29.446 --> 28:32.580
But I think it's best
to keep you out of it.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.844
Yeah.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.767
How quickly
can you find a shovel?

28:48.422 --> 28:50.250
These flashlights
are real subtle.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.817
What the hell
are we doing here?

28:51.817 --> 28:53.470
Well, Sam says he
and Andrew got into an argument

28:53.470 --> 28:55.646
about removing bamboo.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.126
Maybe Andrew didn't want him
touching it

28:57.126 --> 28:59.215
because that's where he was
hiding the file on Tate.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.783
Under the bamboo?
Seriously?

29:03.698 --> 29:06.657
Sounds like a job
for the GBI's Panda Unit.

29:06.657 --> 29:07.789
It's the only lead
we have, all right?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.617
You got a better idea?

29:12.446 --> 29:13.577
Nobody's home.

29:13.577 --> 29:14.970
Now you tell me?

29:14.970 --> 29:17.407
You need a boost?

29:17.407 --> 29:18.757
Could you move your arm?

29:19.714 --> 29:21.585
Not a team sports guy, huh?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.986
Well...

29:33.815 --> 29:35.904
If you're wrong about this,
we're gonna look pretty stupid.

29:47.829 --> 29:51.006
Uh, there's a suspect for you
in holding.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.226
My suspect, right.

29:53.226 --> 29:54.880
Thanks, Lau.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.365
I was told
that I was being brought in

30:02.365 --> 30:04.628
for disorderly conduct.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.108
I don't understand.

30:07.153 --> 30:08.763
Lenny.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.115
Angie.

30:15.683 --> 30:16.902
You're so grown up.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.427
- How--
- Not your type anymore, huh?

30:20.427 --> 30:21.776
Hold on, please.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.647
Angie, I'm sorry.

30:23.647 --> 30:26.346
I am so...

30:26.346 --> 30:28.478
incredibly sorry.

30:28.478 --> 30:31.177
You're sorry for raping me
when I was 15?

30:33.135 --> 30:35.181
Or for getting me pregnant?

30:36.225 --> 30:39.011
Or for all the other girls,
'cause I can't be the only one.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.577
All of it.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.276
I'm sorry for everything.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.278
What I did to you, to myself.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.019
Awful.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.716
I wish
I could take it back.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.112
Listen, I--

30:53.112 --> 30:55.592
Prison changed me.

30:55.592 --> 30:59.814
I have been clean
for 12 years,

30:59.814 --> 31:01.772
and I wanted
to make amends.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.297
And so I have a-- a letter
that I wrote and rewrote,

31:04.297 --> 31:06.255
but now you're here, and I still
don't know what to say,

31:06.255 --> 31:09.041
except for I'm sorry
for what I did.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.217
And all I can do
is promise you

31:11.217 --> 31:13.915
that I am not
that man anymore.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.966
It's great to see you...

31:20.966 --> 31:22.924
helping people for a living.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.578
I can't do this.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.232
I don't know
what I was thinking.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.376
Here's what I don't get--

31:40.376 --> 31:42.291
You blow your nose
with that thing, right?

31:42.291 --> 31:46.295
Then you just keep it
in your pocket all day?

31:46.295 --> 31:48.471
Yeah, Angie won't
answer me, either.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.430
It's a serious question.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.997
You know, I don't know how
you do it, Ormewood, honestly.

31:51.997 --> 31:55.565
All those deep thoughts
just swirling around your head.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.488
That's either a septic tank
or a miracle.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.365
Yeah.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.062
Oh.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.457
Under the bamboo.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.986
Lenny,
what did they want?

32:24.986 --> 32:26.379
I don't know.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.076
It was just a big misunderstanding.

32:34.561 --> 32:36.084
Your mother worries
too much.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.738
Isn't that right, Crystal?

32:46.834 --> 32:49.054
You know, it's surprisingly easy
to pick these locks.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.534
You just need a paperclip,
a little bit of patience.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.060
I guess that works, too.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.330
Well, Andrew was nothing
if not thorough.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.810
He had records of every
evidence seizure.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.769
What they found and then
what they brought in.

33:08.769 --> 33:11.206
And we're talking guns,
drugs, and money.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.903
Yeah, Andrew took
these photos

33:12.903 --> 33:15.994
a few weeks
before he was murdered.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.000
Trent.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.480
APD got a tip
from a sheriff in Pickens.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.221
A lady said two people
tried to steal her phone

33:26.221 --> 33:27.701
at a gas station.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.485
<i>Profiles match Faith
and LaPorte.</i>

33:29.485 --> 33:30.878
What's in Pickens?

33:30.878 --> 33:32.575
A few years ago, there was
a string of burglaries

33:32.575 --> 33:34.360
at a resort community.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.275
<i>MO matches LaPorte's.
He might be headed back.</i>

33:36.275 --> 33:38.494
We've gotta get there before
someone takes a shot at Faith.

33:38.494 --> 33:40.409
<i>We just found proof
that Tate was keeping evidence,</i>

33:40.409 --> 33:41.454
<i>stealing it.</i>

33:41.454 --> 33:43.021
Hollis knew.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.457
We got enough
to re-open the case.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.154
I want that on my desk now.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.590
I'll follow up
on the evidence.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.983
<i>This is Detective Ormewood.</i>

33:48.983 --> 33:50.158
What's he doing there
with you?

33:50.158 --> 33:51.681
I'm on the right side
of this, ma'am.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.770
I hope so.
Get it done.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.033
Will, I'm on my way.

33:56.817 --> 33:59.298
I got this.
Go get your partner.

34:00.386 --> 34:01.387
Thank you.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.519
Don't make it weird.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.347
I don't know how not to.

34:06.566 --> 34:11.136
<i>♪ Think of the future ♪</i>

34:11.136 --> 34:12.920

34:12.920 --> 34:15.488

34:15.488 --> 34:17.359
Oh, my gosh.
You're horrible at this.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.013
Okay, well,
you're a criminal.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.319
Your knife skills
are criminal.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.407

34:28.022 --> 34:32.113
No, actually, um, there's
some... pine nuts in the fridge.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.332
Bottom left shelf.

34:33.332 --> 34:34.724
You told me
to get to learn the fridge.

34:34.724 --> 34:35.769
I listened.

34:38.032 --> 34:42.080
You know, people always
talk about murder and arson,

34:42.080 --> 34:45.692
but you wanna know the most
heinous crime of them all is?

34:45.692 --> 34:47.694
The price of pine nuts.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.565
Dump 'em.

34:49.565 --> 34:52.046
Yep, there goes somebody's
college tuition, right there.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.483
Where did you learn
how to cook?

34:54.483 --> 34:55.832
My mom.

34:55.832 --> 34:58.357
- Your mom.
- Mm-hmm.

34:58.357 --> 34:59.880
What's she like?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.751
Oh, she never missed
a single day of my trial.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.189
And, you know, it didn't look
good from the jump,

35:04.189 --> 35:05.842
but she kept showing up.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.889
All right, let me taste.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.550
Mmm.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.334
Not bad.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.206
Needs some pepper.

35:22.468 --> 35:23.947
- Your mom...
- Yeah?

35:23.947 --> 35:26.385
- She sounds great.
- Yeah, she is.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.735
You know, she lent me the money
to help me start my business.

35:28.735 --> 35:31.041
- Your landscaping business.
- Mm-hmm.

35:31.041 --> 35:34.654
Okay, so did you have,
like, employees?

35:34.654 --> 35:37.613
- Yeah, I, uh, had employees.
- Mm.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.746
Um, Glen was one of them.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.749
I am so sorry.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.751
- He was your friend.
- Yeah.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.101
Everything happened
so fast today.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.537
I just didn't have
time to think.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.669
Yeah.

35:49.669 --> 35:51.410
Look, I made
a lot of mistakes,

35:51.410 --> 35:53.542
and, you know,
I turned things around

35:53.542 --> 35:54.761
and then, you know,
this happened.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.110
My life is over.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.068
No. Not yet.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.680
We're gonna
make things right.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.204

36:06.207 --> 36:07.600

36:14.520 --> 36:17.697
Faith Mitchell!
I know you're in there!

36:17.697 --> 36:20.352
You hand Sam over,
we can work something out.

36:20.352 --> 36:24.747
Or I can just start lobbing
grenades in the living room.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.534
I'm going out there.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.926
- No, no, no. Don't.
- I have to.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.714
Hey.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.896
Thank you...

36:42.896 --> 36:44.289
for everything.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.991
You stay here.

36:50.991 --> 36:54.821
You're my responsibility,
and I will protect you.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.408
Tate!

37:16.408 --> 37:17.931
I'm only gonna ask you
this once.

37:17.931 --> 37:18.975
Get back in the car--

37:23.371 --> 37:25.547
Backup's on the way, Mitchell.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.202
It's all over.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.987
You and your mom are leaving
quite the legacy.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.959
- Aaaah!
- Sam!

38:15.162 --> 38:16.598
Hey.

38:24.780 --> 38:25.868
Drop your weapon!

38:27.305 --> 38:29.568
Get your hands
over your head!

38:29.568 --> 38:31.178
Don't shoot!

38:31.178 --> 38:34.007
My name is Faith Mitchell,
and I'm a GBI agent.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.674
Where is she?

38:52.373 --> 38:54.027
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.380
Hey, wait right there.
Not so fast.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.861
Special Agent Mitchell is
under arrest for shooting a cop.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.037
Three hours ago,
Detective Ormewood and the GBI

39:04.037 --> 39:05.908
seized stolen cash
and several weapons,

39:05.908 --> 39:08.128
including the gun used
to murder Officer Hollis.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.303
And what does that have to do
with the fact

39:09.303 --> 39:10.783
that she murdered a cop?

39:10.783 --> 39:13.133
It was found in a storage unit
rented by Tate Grillo.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.569
Special Agent Mitchell
was defending herself

39:14.569 --> 39:17.877
against a criminal,
and she's coming home with me.

39:25.972 --> 39:28.017
I'm sorry.

39:28.017 --> 39:30.368
You did the right thing, Faith.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.239
You did.

39:46.601 --> 39:49.561
This is how you decide to
tell me Betty has a puppygram?

40:16.936 --> 40:18.503
They're overturning
your conviction.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.462
It's official-- you did not
murder Andrew Hollis.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.898
- H--
- Will did.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.465
He found the weapon that Tate
used to kill Andrew.

40:24.465 --> 40:25.684
So, does that mean
I get to go home?

40:25.684 --> 40:27.033
You still escaped
from custody,

40:27.033 --> 40:28.861
assaulted an officer
at the courtroom,

40:28.861 --> 40:30.166
kidnapped me, uh,

40:30.166 --> 40:32.691
stole two vehicles,
and broke into a cabin.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.954
Yeah, don't forget
about your diabetes medication.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.695
Yeah, I'll put in
a good word with the DA.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.872
Take care of yourself, Sam.

40:41.264 --> 40:42.657
