FELL ASLEEP ON HIS FACE.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.688
OKAY. WELL, THANKS AGAIN.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.565
HEY, A.V. GEEK,

05:54.729 --> 05:57.565
JUST PAN MY BODY NICE AND SLOW.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.234
WHY?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.234
YEAH. WHY?

05:59.276 --> 06:01.528
BECAUSE I'LL NEVER LOOK BETTER

05:59.276 --> 06:01.528
THAN I DO NOW.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.655
COME ON, LADIES.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.655
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.493
A.V. GEEK, I'M GOING

06:05.782 --> 06:08.493
TO NEED SIX MINUTES.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.162
YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TWO.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.162
ROLLING.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.623
FELLOW CHILTON SENIORS,

06:10.204 --> 06:13.623
IT'S BEEN QUITE A YEAR.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.712
I HATE THIS.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.756
ONE GUEST IN THE WHOLE INN.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.756
ONE GUY.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.009
AND I PULLED

06:21.798 --> 06:24.009
TOWEL DUTY TODAY.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.887
IT'S ESPECIALLY AWFUL

06:24.051 --> 06:26.887
HANDLING GUEST'S TOWELS

06:26.928 --> 06:29.472
WHEN YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHICH

06:26.928 --> 06:29.472
GUEST THE TOWELS BELONG TO.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.059
IT'S HIS MITES

06:29.514 --> 06:32.059
ON THOSE TOWELS.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.560
DON'T BE GROSS.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.271
THIS IS DEGRADING FOR A MAN

06:33.601 --> 06:36.271
OF MY CAPABILITIES.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.480
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.233
I'VE GOT NO KITCHEN.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.233
I'M A CHEF.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.525
MY SKILLS ARE DETERIORATING.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.028
I NEED TO SAUTE, EMULSIFY,

06:40.567 --> 06:43.028
MARINATE.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.280
I NEED MORE MENTAL

06:43.070 --> 06:45.280
STIMULATION.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.158
I NEED TO FREAKIN' FRY A DEAD

06:45.322 --> 06:48.158
ANIMAL IN A SKILLET.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.284
I'M GOING NUTS.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.952
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DANCER.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.081
WHAT?

06:50.994 --> 06:54.081
MY MOTHER PUT ME IN DANCE

06:50.994 --> 06:54.081
SCHOOL, AND I REBELLED.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.917
I WANTED TO KICK

06:54.122 --> 06:56.917
THE FOOTBALL.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.917
I SHOULD NOT HAVE.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.961
I'VE SEEN YOU DANCE.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.961
YOU JUMP AROUND LIKE A DUCK.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.590
I'M GETTING MIGHTY

07:00.003 --> 07:03.590
SICK OF YOU.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.590
NOT AS SICK AS I AM OF YOU.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.384
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.384
YOU DO HIS TOWELS.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.594
I'M NOT DOING HIS TOWELS

07:05.424 --> 07:07.594
ANYMORE.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.888
I HATE THAT STUPID GUY

07:07.635 --> 07:09.888
WITH THAT STUPID NEWSPAPER.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.640
YO, GUYS, NO BICKERING

07:09.930 --> 07:12.640
IN FRONT OF THE GUEST.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.851
TELL THAT TO DENEY TERRIO

07:12.682 --> 07:14.851
HERE.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.561
"I SHOULD'VE BEEN

07:14.893 --> 07:16.561
A DANCER."

07:16.603 --> 07:20.065
LORELAI, HOW LONG

07:16.603 --> 07:20.065
CAN WE KEEP THIS UP?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.149
KEEP WHAT UP?

07:21.191 --> 07:23.110
WE HAVE ONE GUEST.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.404
HALF THE ROOMS ARE STILL

07:23.151 --> 07:25.404
CLOSED FROM THE FIRE.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.197
MOST OF THE STAFF

07:25.445 --> 07:27.197
IS LAID OFF.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.782
I AM DOING MITE TOWELS,

07:28.823 --> 07:30.575
AND THE OWNER'S SON

07:28.823 --> 07:30.575
IS WALKING AROUND

07:30.617 --> 07:32.369
WITH A BUNCH OF MEN

07:30.617 --> 07:32.369
IN SUITS.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.371
YEAH, JOHN'S HERE.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.371
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.291
JOHN IS HERE LOOKING THINGS

07:34.413 --> 07:37.291
OVER FOR THE RENOVATION

07:37.332 --> 07:39.084
THAT WILL REOPEN

07:37.332 --> 07:39.084
ALL THE CLOSED ROOMS

07:39.126 --> 07:41.711
SO WE CAN BE UP AND RUNNING

07:39.126 --> 07:41.711

07:41.753 --> 07:43.380
OKAY.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.260
INDEPENDENCE INN.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.260
LORELAI SPEAKING.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.845
LORELAI, IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.845
MOTHER. HI.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.349
I'M CALLING TO FIND OUT

07:50.887 --> 07:54.349
HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK

07:50.887 --> 07:54.349
AT RORY'S GRADUATION.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.351
Are we going to be

07:54.391 --> 07:56.351
sitting together?

07:56.393 --> 07:59.396
WELL, HMM...

07:56.393 --> 07:59.396
HMM...HMM...

07:59.438 --> 08:00.439
LORELAI.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.523
SORRY. HMM...

08:02.565 --> 08:05.277
LORELAI!

08:02.565 --> 08:05.277
MOTHER, OF COURSE.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.277
WE'RE FAMILY.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.071
WELL, I KNEW THAT. I JUST

08:05.319 --> 08:08.071
WASN'T SURE IF YOU DID.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.406
Well, we're sitting

08:08.113 --> 08:09.406
together.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.615
GOOD.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.615
Yes, it is.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.992
ASK HER ABOUT THE GIFT.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.868
DAD?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.868
He's on the other line.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.996
OH. SURE GOT THE QUIET THING

08:13.910 --> 08:15.996

08:16.037 --> 08:19.040
I'M ON THE UPSTAIRS PORTABLE,

08:16.037 --> 08:19.040
BUT I'M ON MY WAY DOWNSTAIRS.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.834
I SEE YOUR MOTHER NOW.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.834
HELLO, EMILY.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.920
I'M ON MY WAY

08:20.875 --> 08:23.920

08:20.875 --> 08:23.920

08:23.962 --> 08:25.713
IT'S LIKE THE THRILLING DAYS

08:23.962 --> 08:25.713
OF RADIO.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.258
WE WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT

08:25.755 --> 08:28.258
A GIFT FOR RORY.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.344
IT'S A BIG GIFT,

08:28.300 --> 08:30.344
A LITTLE EXTRAVAGANT.

08:30.385 --> 08:34.181
IT'S A BIG OCCASION,

08:30.385 --> 08:34.181
SO IT MAKES SENSE.

08:30.385 --> 08:34.181
WE WANT TO BUY HER A CAR.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.723
I-I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.351
REALLY?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.351
WONDERFUL.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.395
Yeah, Rory needs to get back

08:37.392 --> 08:40.395

08:40.437 --> 08:43.731
AND THE QUICKER SHE DOES IT,

08:40.437 --> 08:43.731
THE MORE I GET TO SEE HER.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.442
YES, RIGHT.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.527
I SUPPOSE SO.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.527
DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

08:47.568 --> 08:51.281
JUST NOT A GAS GUZZLER

08:47.568 --> 08:51.281
AND NO FERRARIS OR LAMBORGHINIS.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.615
SO, NOTHING ITALIAN?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.784
IT CAN BE ITALIAN,

08:52.657 --> 08:54.784
JUST SENSIBLE ITALIAN.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.328
ALRIGHT.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.328
WELL, GOOD.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.038
I'M GLAD WE HAVE THIS

08:56.370 --> 08:58.038

GOOD. WELL, MAYBE I'LL SEE

08:58.079 --> 09:00.832

WELL, I-I GUESS THIS MEANS

11:34.402 --> 11:37.656
THAT YOU GUYS CAN FOCUS SOLELY

11:34.402 --> 11:37.656
ON REFURBISHING THE DRAGONFLY,

11:37.696 --> 11:39.491
GETTING THAT UP AND RUNNING.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.491
THAT'S EXCITING.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.659
YES, IT IS.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.577
YEAH, I AGREE.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.577
JUST DRINK SOME MORE.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.245
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

11:44.287 --> 11:46.956
A LITTLE DRUNK, AND ALL I'M

11:44.287 --> 11:46.956
DRINKING IS APPLE JUICE.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.834
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'VE GOT ANOTHER

11:46.998 --> 11:49.834
LITTLE PIECE OF NEWS FOR YOU.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.670
WE CAN'T BUY THE DRAGONFLY

11:51.710 --> 11:53.963
BECAUSE I CAN'T SWING MY SHARE

11:51.710 --> 11:53.963
OF THE MONEY

11:54.005 --> 11:56.424
BECAUSE I NO LONGER

11:54.005 --> 11:56.424
HAVE A STEADY INCOME.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.093
WOW. THAT IS GREAT.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.720
I'M SORRY. WAS THAT AN EXCITING

11:59.135 --> 12:01.720
CHALLENGE, TOO?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.139
ABSOLUTELY.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.891
YESTERDAY OUR LIVES WERE

12:03.181 --> 12:04.891
BORING AND PREDICTABLE.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.435
WE HAD JOBS. WE WERE GONNA

12:04.932 --> 12:07.435
START OUR OWN BUSINESS.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.437
BUT NOW EVERYTHING

12:07.477 --> 12:09.437
IS WIDE OPEN.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.273
WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE WANT

12:09.479 --> 12:12.273
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PENNED IN.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.732
THAT'S GOOD.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.527
YES, THAT'S GOOD.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.613
THINKING OF THOSE NEW CHALLENGES

12:15.569 --> 12:18.613
IS A NICE WAY TO DISTRACT ME

12:18.655 --> 12:20.907
FROM THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WORK

12:18.655 --> 12:20.907
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.702
SO WE'RE GONNA SEE WAY LESS

12:20.948 --> 12:23.702
OF EACH OTHER, SO...

12:23.742 --> 12:27.163
WHICH WILL MAKE OUR LIMITED TIME

12:23.742 --> 12:27.163
TOGETHER MORE ENJOYABLE!

12:27.205 --> 12:29.748
RIGHT, AND SINCE I'M YOUR

12:27.205 --> 12:29.748
VEGETABLE SUPPLIER,

12:29.790 --> 12:31.334
I'M LOSING WORK

12:31.376 --> 12:35.088
AND SEEING MY WIFE AND CLOSE

12:31.376 --> 12:35.088
FRIEND WAY LESS THAN BEFORE.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.548
CHEERS!

12:36.590 --> 12:37.591
YEAH.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.721
THAT WOULD CONVERT IT INTO

12:39.800 --> 12:42.721
A TOWN BYLAW,

12:42.761 --> 12:45.265
A MINOR BUT NONETHELESS

12:42.761 --> 12:45.265
IMPORTANT CHANGE

12:45.306 --> 12:47.183
FROM LOCAL ORDINANCE,

12:47.225 --> 12:51.938
GIVING US THE LEEWAY TO ENFORCE

12:47.225 --> 12:51.938
CHARTER AMENDMENTS FIVE AND SIX

12:51.979 --> 12:56.109

13:11.708 --> 13:14.877
WITH YOU?

13:14.919 --> 13:19.215
IT MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME

13:14.919 --> 13:19.215
60 PEOPLE LOST THEIR TRAIN

13:14.919 --> 13:19.215
OF THOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.051
TAYLOR, YOUR VOICE ALWAYS MAKES

13:19.257 --> 13:22.051

13:25.972 --> 13:28.558
AN UNPLEASANT SUBJECT,

13:28.600 --> 13:31.060
BUT THE DEER POPULATION

13:28.600 --> 13:31.060
IN THIS TOWN

13:31.102 --> 13:33.354
IS REACHING MONSTROUS

13:31.102 --> 13:33.354
PROPORTIONS.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.731
NOT THIS AGAIN.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.733
HE'S ALWAYS GOING ON

13:34.773 --> 13:36.733

13:36.775 --> 13:38.067

13:38.109 --> 13:39.694
BUT THEY'RE TAKING OVER

13:38.109 --> 13:39.694
THE TOWN.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.656
WE NEED TO INSTITUTE

13:39.736 --> 13:42.656

13:42.697 --> 13:44.282
PARTIAL ELIMINATION?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.825

13:44.324 --> 13:46.825

13:46.867 --> 13:50.330
PEOPLE, DO I HAVE TO DETAIL THE

13:46.867 --> 13:50.330
PROBLEMS THAT THESE DEER CAUSE?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.872
NO, BUT YOU WILL.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.875

YEAH, THOSE ONES

13:57.378 --> 13:59.255
YOU CAN SNUFF.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.258
BUT THE WORST PROBLEM

13:59.297 --> 14:02.258
IS THE CROP LOSS.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.135
DEAN, HAND ME THE BLOWUP,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.135
PLEASE.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.471
HEY, DEAN, HE'S PAYING YOU

14:04.177 --> 14:06.471
FOR ALL THIS, RIGHT?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.473
YEAH.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.473
REALLY? HOW MUCH?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.810
PEOPLE, THIS IS

14:08.515 --> 14:11.810

14:11.850 --> 14:14.521
BUT TYPICAL LANDSCAPED AREA

14:11.850 --> 14:14.521
IN THE TOWN

14:14.562 --> 14:17.982

14:14.562 --> 14:17.982
RUMINANT PESTS.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.275

14:19.317 --> 14:20.527
TAYLOR, THAT'S YOUR BACKYARD.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.362
THIS IS A LITTLE

14:20.568 --> 14:22.362
SELF-SERVING.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.905
IT MIGHT BE MY YARD.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.909
MIGHT BE? TAYLOR, NO ONE HAS

14:24.947 --> 14:28.909
A "KISS THE GARDENER" SIGN.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.953
THIS IS A TRUMPED-UP

14:28.951 --> 14:30.953
PROBLEM.

14:30.995 --> 14:34.040
SO, NONE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED

14:30.995 --> 14:34.040
IN ADDRESSING THIS SCOURGE?

14:34.081 --> 14:35.458
I HAVE A THOUGHT.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.043
A CONTROLLED HUNT.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.838
GUNS?

14:37.084 --> 14:39.838
NOT GUNS, WOLVES.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.674
YOU RELEASE A PACK OF WOLVES,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.674
THEY EAT THE DEER.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.509
PROBLEM SOLVED.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.303
OF COURSE, THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO

14:44.551 --> 14:47.303
DEAL WITH YOUR WOLF PROBLEMS.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.097
I SAY THAT WE DEFER THIS

14:47.345 --> 14:50.097

14:50.139 --> 14:52.141

14:50.139 --> 14:52.141

14:52.183 --> 14:53.476

14:53.518 --> 14:55.395

15:00.191 --> 15:02.109
YES, AND I AM STILL

15:00.191 --> 15:02.109

VERY GOOD GUY.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.324

15:50.366 --> 15:53.160

15:50.366 --> 15:53.160
WEDDINGS AT THE INN,

15:53.202 --> 15:55.204
AND I'VE WORKED ON A LOT

15:53.202 --> 15:55.204
OF THEM.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.164
SO I'M A FOUNTAIN

15:55.246 --> 15:57.164
OF USEFUL TIPS.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.625
GOOD.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.212

16:00.376 --> 16:03.212
ALONG WITH THE OTHER ONES.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.757

16:03.254 --> 16:05.757
OF YOUR FAVORITE MOMENTS,

16:05.799 --> 16:08.802
AND YOU WON'T BE STUCK WITH

16:05.799 --> 16:08.802
JUST THE STIFF POSED SHOTS.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.511
CANDID. OKAY.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.306
AND IF THE RING BEARER IS

16:10.553 --> 16:13.306
YOUNGER THAN 5 YEARS OLD...

16:13.347 --> 16:14.891
MY NEPHEW -- HE'S 3.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.226
DON'T GIVE HIM THE RING

16:14.933 --> 16:17.226
UNTIL THE LAST SECOND.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.353
BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN

16:17.268 --> 16:19.353
MANY A RING SWALLOWED,

16:19.395 --> 16:22.315
AND WELL, IT TAKES A COUPLE

16:19.395 --> 16:22.315
DAYS TO GET IT BACK.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.066
GOOD POINT.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.569
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN KIND OF

16:24.108 --> 16:26.569
OVERWHELMING.

I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO RENT

16:26.611 --> 16:29.739

MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DEPOSIT

16:29.781 --> 16:31.532

17:05.399 --> 17:07.944

17:07.986 --> 17:10.112

17:07.986 --> 17:10.112
A SHARPENER.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.615

17:52.655 --> 17:54.114
UGH. I SHOULD GO.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.909
GOT A STUPID JOB INTERVIEW

17:54.156 --> 17:55.909
TOMORROW MORNING.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.744
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:55.950 --> 17:57.744
I'M NERVOUS.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.744
WHICH PLACE?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.161
HARRINGTON'S IN WOODBRIDGE.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.415
THEY WANT ME TO BE THEIR

17:59.203 --> 18:02.415
EXECUTIVE CHEF.

18:02.456 --> 18:06.252
GOD, I CAN'T IMAGINE WORKING

18:02.456 --> 18:06.252
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

18:02.456 --> 18:06.252
AND WITHOUT MY LORELAI.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.047
BUT IT'S ONLY A FEW MONTHS TILL

18:06.293 --> 18:09.047
THE DRAGONFLY OPENS, RIGHT?

18:09.088 --> 18:12.132
UH...YOU HAVEN'T TOLD

18:09.088 --> 18:12.132
HER YET.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.132
TELL ME WHAT?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.802
I WAS WAITING

18:12.174 --> 18:14.802
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.802
TO TELL ME WHAT?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.470
WHICH APPARENTLY

18:14.844 --> 18:16.470
IS RIGHT NOW.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.974
OKAY, UM, HON, LISTEN.

18:20.016 --> 18:23.728
WE, UM, WE'RE NOT BUYING

18:20.016 --> 18:23.728
THE DRAGONFLY.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.938
WHAT?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.856
IT'S JUST NOT

18:24.979 --> 18:26.856
THE RIGHT TIME.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.275
YOU'RE CRAZY.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.275
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.275
NOT REALLY.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.028
BUT IF YOU WAIT, SOMEONE ELSE

18:29.316 --> 18:32.028
IS GONNA BUY IT.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.321
I'M GONNA GO, GUYS.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.321
SORRY TO SPILL THE BEANS.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.907
THAT'S OKAY.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.907
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.658
MOM, WHY PUT IT OFF?

18:37.700 --> 18:40.494
I MEAN, I KNOW THE INDEPENDENCE

18:37.700 --> 18:40.494
INN CLOSING IS A SETBACK --

18:40.536 --> 18:43.039
BIG ONE.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.039
BUT WE'VE GOT THE REST

18:40.536 --> 18:43.039
OF GRANDPA'S MONEY.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.832
THAT'S PLENTY TO BUY

18:43.081 --> 18:44.832
THE DRAGONFLY INN.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.375
WE'LL JUST SCRIMP

18:44.874 --> 18:46.375
ON EVERYTHING

18:46.417 --> 18:48.335
UNTIL IT'S UP AND RUNNING

18:46.417 --> 18:48.335
AND SUCCESSFUL.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.129
IT WOULD TAKE A LOT

18:48.377 --> 18:50.129
OF SCRIMPING.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.756
WELL, I'M A MASTER SCRIMPER.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.300
I WOULD MAKE THE OLYMPIC

18:51.798 --> 18:54.300
SCRIMPING TEAM. I'M THAT GOOD.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.343
HONEY, WE DIDN'T GET

18:54.341 --> 18:56.343
FINANCIAL AID FOR YALE.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.388
NO SCHOLARSHIPS, NO HARDSHIP

18:56.385 --> 18:59.388
MONEY, NO MONEY-OFF COUPONS,

18:59.430 --> 19:00.723
NO GIFT CERTIFICATES,

18:59.430 --> 19:00.723
NOTHING.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.558
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.558
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.561
WELL, IRONY OF IRONIES, THE

19:02.600 --> 19:05.561
MONEY I GOT FROM YOUR GRANDPA

19:05.603 --> 19:07.855
TOOK US OUT OF THE RUNNING

19:05.603 --> 19:07.855
FOR FINANCIAL AID

19:07.897 --> 19:10.190
'CAUSE IT MADE IT LOOK LIKE

19:07.897 --> 19:10.190
WE HAVE MONEY.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.525
WELL, SEND THEM PROOF.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.444
HERE, TAKE A PICTURE

19:11.567 --> 19:13.444
OF THIS COUCH.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.530
NO ONE WILL THINK WE HAVE MONEY

19:13.486 --> 19:16.530
AFTER LOOKING AT THIS COUCH.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.325
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.325
I SWEAR.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.325
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.911
I DIDN'T WANT YOU

19:19.366 --> 19:21.911
WORRYING.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.288
BUT GRANDPA'S MONEY --

19:21.953 --> 19:24.288
IS PAYING FOR YALE.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.581
NO. NO WAY.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.874
RORY...

19:26.916 --> 19:29.209
I'LL TAKE A STUDENT LOAN OUT

19:26.916 --> 19:29.209
FROM THE BANK.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.546
I DON'T WANT YOU BURIED

19:29.251 --> 19:32.546
BY LOANS THE DAY

19:29.251 --> 19:32.546
YOU GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE.

19:32.588 --> 19:36.425
I'LL MAJOR IN SOMETHING

19:32.588 --> 19:36.425
THAT'LL IMMEDIATELY MAKE ME A

19:32.588 --> 19:36.425
LOT OF MONEY WHEN I GRADUATE.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.011
I'LL MAJOR IN BUSINESS

19:36.467 --> 19:38.011
OR ENGINEERING.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.887
YOU'RE NOT CHANGING YOUR MAJOR

19:38.052 --> 19:39.887
FORM JOURNALISM

19:39.929 --> 19:41.597
BECAUSE OF MY LACK

19:39.929 --> 19:41.597
OF MONEY.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.223
IT'S<i> OUR</i> LACK.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
IF YOU NEED TO WORK AS A

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
LOW-PAID INTERN FOR A MAGAZINE

19:46.644 --> 19:48.938
OR A STRINGER FOR SOME

19:46.644 --> 19:48.938
SMALL-TOWN NEWSPAPER,

19:48.980 --> 19:52.025
OR TOM BROKAW'S

19:48.980 --> 19:52.025
TOUPEE-COMBER-OUTER

19:52.066 --> 19:54.819
BEFORE YOU MAKE REAL MONEY,

19:52.066 --> 19:54.819
THEN THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL DO.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.403
THERE HAS TO BE

19:54.861 --> 19:56.403
ANOTHER WAY.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.156
I LOOKED.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.156
THERE'S NOTHING.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.991
THIS IS SO NOT FAIR

19:58.197 --> 19:59.991
TO YOU.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.284
I'LL HAVE MY OWN INN ONE DAY,

20:00.033 --> 20:02.284
I PROMISE,

20:02.326 --> 20:03.953
BUT YALE COMES FIRST.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.705
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

20:05.746 --> 20:07.707
RAIL AT GOD FOR A WHILE.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.709
TELL HER I SAID HI.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.422
WHAT HAPPENED

20:14.213 --> 20:15.422
TO OUR PACKING ELVES

20:15.464 --> 20:17.008
WHO WERE GONNA PACK

20:15.464 --> 20:17.008
OUR PACKS OVERNIGHT?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.425
HOW ABOUT THIS?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.761
YOU HATE THE DRESS I MADE YOU

20:18.467 --> 20:20.761
THAT MUCH?

20:20.803 --> 20:22.138
NOT FOR GRADUATION,

20:20.803 --> 20:22.138
FOR EUROPE.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.597
OH, IT'S PERFECT.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.892
IT'S BLACK, SO IT WON'T SHOW

20:23.639 --> 20:25.892
DIRT OR WRINKLES.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.978
AND IF YOU WEAR IT WITH A MOODY

20:25.933 --> 20:28.978
LOOK ON YOUR FACE,

20:29.020 --> 20:31.064
THEY'LL MISTAKE YOU FOR

20:29.020 --> 20:31.064
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.357
IT'S TOO HEAVY.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.357
SO, WAS THAT

20:31.105 --> 20:33.357
A TRICK QUESTION?

20:33.399 --> 20:35.651
WE BOTH NEED TO CUT WEIGHT

20:33.399 --> 20:35.651
FROM OUR PACKS.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.195
I AM DOING MY PART HERE.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.988
YOU DON'T NEED FIVE PAIRS

20:37.236 --> 20:38.988
OF BOOTS.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.323
I'LL DROP SOME BOOTS

20:39.030 --> 20:41.323
IF YOU DROP SOME BOOKS.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.742
YOU CAN'T BRING 12 BOOKS.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.535
YOU ALSO NEED TO CUT YOUR

20:42.783 --> 20:44.535
UNDERGARMENTS.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.412
WE'LL RINSE IN WOOLITE

20:44.577 --> 20:46.412
EVERY FEW DAYS.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.288
THIS IS GOING TO AN

20:46.453 --> 20:48.288
UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.332
AND YOUR TOOTHPASTE --

20:48.330 --> 20:50.332
YOU HAVE THREE FULL TUBES.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.876
WHY THREE?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.670
IF I LOSE ONE, I'LL HAVE ANOTHER

20:51.918 --> 20:54.670
TO TAKE ITS PLACE.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.090
THEN I'M BRINGING 12 BOOKS,

20:54.712 --> 20:57.090
PLUS A DICTIONARY.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.925
THEN I'M BRINGING A GALLON

20:57.131 --> 20:58.925
OF MERCURY,

20:58.966 --> 21:01.635
WHICH IS ONE OF THE HEAVIEST

20:58.966 --> 21:01.635
SUBSTANCES KNOWN TO MAN.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.138
I THINK THE WRITING'S

21:01.677 --> 21:04.138
ON THE WALL HERE.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.138
CANCEL EUROPE.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.182
I'VE GOTTA RUN.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.182
I LOVE MY GRADUATION DRESS.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.641
I KNOW.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.727
IT'S A SHAME ABOUT EUROPE

21:07.683 --> 21:09.727
BEING CANCELED, HUH?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
THAT GREAT ANYWAY,

21:11.812 --> 21:12.897
EXCEPT FOR THE CHEESE.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.440
NINE BOOKS

21:12.939 --> 21:14.440
FOR TWO TOOTHPASTES.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.608
DEAL.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.696
WHO IS IT, EMILY?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.696
I DON'T KNOW, RICHARD.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.740
MY X-RAY VISION ISN'T WORKING

21:20.738 --> 21:22.740
AT THE MOMENT.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.909
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU

21:22.782 --> 21:24.909
WERE EXPECTING SOMEBODY.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.326
I WASN'T EXPECTING ANYBODY.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.495
RORY.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.206
HI, GRANDMA.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.206
HI, GRANDPA.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.250
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE

21:30.248 --> 21:32.250
ON THIS BUSY DAY?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.836
I HAVE SORT OF

21:32.291 --> 21:35.836
A TIME-SENSITIVE ISSUE

21:32.291 --> 21:35.836
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.379
TIME-SENSITIVE?

21:35.878 --> 21:37.379
WELL, COME IN, COME IN.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.635
WE WERE JUST GETTING READY

21:40.633 --> 21:42.635
FOR YOUR CEREMONY.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.179
I WAS JUST RETYING MY TIE

21:42.676 --> 21:45.179
FOR THE THIRD TIME.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.808
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES

21:45.221 --> 21:48.808
I TIE A TIE,

21:45.221 --> 21:48.808
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR ERROR.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.644
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE,

21:48.849 --> 21:51.644
IS IT?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.644
NOR AN ART FORM.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.395
SIT DOWN. PLEASE.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.565
OKAY.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.565
ALRIGHT.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.692
SHOULD WE BE NERVOUS?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.320
NO. YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.320
I AM A LITTLE.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.990
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.116
I NEED MONEY.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.659
YOU NEED MONEY.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.659
FOR YALE.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.410
YOU NEED MONEY FOR YALE.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.913
STOP REPEATING EVERYTHING

22:08.452 --> 22:10.913
SHE SAYS.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.913
I'M PROCESSING.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.791
LOOK, IT'S A LONG STORY, BUT NO

22:10.955 --> 22:13.791
OTHER FINANCING CAME THROUGH.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.919
AND ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT

22:13.833 --> 22:16.919
MOM AND I HAVE ARE JUST --

22:16.961 --> 22:19.005
WELL, NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.005
SO, HERE'S THE OFFER --

22:19.046 --> 22:22.842
I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU

22:19.046 --> 22:22.842
TO LOAN ME THE MONEY

22:19.046 --> 22:22.842
FOR FOUR YEARS AT YALE.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.094
AND IN RETURN, I WILL

22:22.883 --> 22:25.094
PAY YOU IN INSTALLMENTS.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.138
I WILL CONTINUE THIS PAYMENT

22:25.136 --> 22:27.138
SCHEDULE AFTER GRADUATION,

22:27.180 --> 22:29.515
INCREASING THE PAYMENT AMOUNTS

22:27.180 --> 22:29.515
IN PROPORTION TO MY INCOME.

22:29.556 --> 22:32.643
PLUS, I WILL REINSTATE

22:29.556 --> 22:32.643
FRIDAY-NIGHT DINNERS WITH ME.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.729

22:35.771 --> 22:37.397
WELL, HOW WONDERFUL.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.775
WE'VE MISSED YOU, RORY.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.775
I'VE MISSED YOU, TOO.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.402
SO, THIS SHOULD WORK OUT

22:39.817 --> 22:42.402
FOR EVERYONE, RIGHT?

22:42.444 --> 22:44.155
ABSOLUTELY.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.155
WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.698
NOT SO FAST.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.159
I'M HAPPY TO PAY FOR YALE,

22:48.201 --> 22:50.452
BUT I DON'T WANT IT

22:48.201 --> 22:50.452
TO BE A LOAN.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.246
I WANT IT TO BE A LOAN.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.706
BECAUSE, OTHERWISE,

22:52.288 --> 22:53.706
IT'S TOO EASY.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.333
WELL, THEN, HERE'S

22:53.747 --> 22:55.333
MY COUNTEROFFER.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.792
LET'S MAKE IT A LOAN,

22:56.834 --> 22:59.337
BUT I INSIST THAT YOU NOT

22:56.834 --> 22:59.337
START PAYING IT BACK

22:59.377 --> 23:01.588
UNTIL AT LEAST FIVE YEARS

22:59.377 --> 23:01.588
AFTER YOU GRADUATE,

23:01.630 --> 23:03.632
SEVEN YEARS IF YOU GO

23:01.630 --> 23:03.632
FOR YOUR MASTER'S.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.719
THAT SOUNDS FAIR,

23:03.674 --> 23:06.719
BUT I SHOULD PAY INTEREST.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.719
NO.

23:06.760 --> 23:12.892

36:22.639 --> 36:24.557
I DON'T KNOW

36:22.639 --> 36:24.557
IF THE TIMING'S RIGHT.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.351
THINGS ARE KIND OF WEIRD

36:24.599 --> 36:26.351
RIGHT NOW.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.603
OH, NO.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.603
IT'S BECAUSE I TEASED YOU

36:28.645 --> 36:30.355

36:28.645 --> 36:30.355

PLEASE PROMISE ME

36:32.231 --> 36:34.109

36:34.151 --> 36:35.735
BUT YOU WEREN'T WRONG

36:34.151 --> 36:35.735
ABOUT THAT.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.070
IT GOT ME THINKING,

36:37.112 --> 36:39.781
AND IT IS KIND OF LIKE

36:37.112 --> 36:39.781
COMMITTING TO HER.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.700
I DON'T WANT TO LEAD HER ON.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.953
BUT YOU LIKE HER, LUKE.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.953
YOU LIKE HER A LOT, DON'T YOU?

36:44.995 --> 36:46.872

37:00.802 --> 37:03.304
I GUESS I WAS JUST NERVOUS

37:00.802 --> 37:03.304

42:44.270 --> 42:46.064
ARCHITECTURAL DOODAD...

42:46.105 --> 42:48.233
AND WINGDINGS

42:46.105 --> 42:48.233
AND TUM-TUMS.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.692
THAT WAS CLOSE.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.610
JUST CARVE IT REALLY TINY

42:51.652 --> 42:53.405
HERE ON THE BASEBOARD

42:51.652 --> 42:53.405
OF THE WALL

42:53.446 --> 42:56.324
AND DO IT REVERSED,

42:53.446 --> 42:56.324
SO G.L. AND G.R.

42:56.366 --> 42:59.202
OH, MAYBE IT'S NOT SUCH

42:56.366 --> 42:59.202
A GOOD IDEA.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.953
THE MADNESS PASSES.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.082
HEY, YOU GUYS COMING?

43:00.995 --> 43:04.082
PARTY AT YOUR PLACE, RIGHT?

43:04.123 --> 43:05.791
A PARTY?

43:04.123 --> 43:05.791
JUST A LITTLE GATHERING.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.626
WE'LL MEET YOU BACK

43:05.833 --> 43:07.626
AT OUR HOUSE.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.421
OKAY. SEE YOU THERE.

43:09.462 --> 43:13.383
WAIT, WAIT.

43:09.462 --> 43:13.383
LOOK AROUND FOR A SECOND.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.636
YOU NOTICE?

43:17.678 --> 43:19.680
NOTICE WHAT?

43:19.722 --> 43:23.309
IT'S NOT SO SCARY ANYMORE.

43:23.351 --> 43:25.520
NO. IT'S NOT.
