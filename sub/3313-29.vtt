WEBVTT

00:07.888 --> 00:09.549
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.891
ALL RIGHT, MIXING UP A PITCHER
OF YOUR DAD'S FAVORITE DRINK.

00:11.892 --> 00:13.223
I HOPE IT'S THE WAY
THAT HE LIKES IT.

00:13.224 --> 00:16.516
THE WAY HE LIKES IT IS SERVED
IN A STRIPPER'S NAVEL.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.899
THAT'S TOO BAD. ALL OF OUR
STRIPPERS ARE IN THE DISHWASHER.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.642
DO ME A FAVOR. TAKE A LITTLE SIP
OF THAT AND TELL ME IF IT'S GOOD.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.276
WHOA, SLOW DOWN!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:26.567 --> 00:28.148
MENTALLY PREPARING FOR
MY FATHER'S VISIT.

00:28.149 --> 00:30.990
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE SO NERVOUS ABOUT.

00:30.991 --> 00:32.862
YOUR DAD'S PROUD OF YOU THAT
YOU'RE RUNNING FOR STATE SENATE.

00:32.863 --> 00:35.535
NOT TO MENTION, FOR A CHANGE,
HE'S ACTUALLY BEING SUPPORTIVE.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.157
WELL, I'M NOT NERVOUS
ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:37.158 --> 00:38.368
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT SOMETHING

00:38.369 --> 00:39.579
I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM. (
chuckles nervously )

00:39.580 --> 00:40.960
OH, COME ON, BABY.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

00:40.961 --> 00:43.163
- WHAT ARE YOU SO NERVOUS ABOUT?
- OH, NOTHING.

00:43.164 --> 00:44.664
YOU KNOW, JUST
WHEN HE GETS HERE,

00:44.665 --> 00:46.796
DON'T DO THAT. AND, UM...

00:46.797 --> 00:48.928
DON'T CALL ME "BABY."
( chuckles )

00:48.929 --> 00:50.970
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:50.971 --> 00:52.302
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD YOUR
FATHER ABOUT US.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.884
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SUPER
CRITICAL OF THE MEN I DATE.

00:54.885 --> 00:56.936
I MEAN, THE ONES WHO
WERE LONG-TERM.

00:56.937 --> 00:59.479
YOU KNOW, WHO MADE
IT TILL MORNING.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.441
MORNING, YEAH, THAT'S
AN IMPRESSIVE MILESTONE

01:01.442 --> 01:03.854
- FOR ANY RELATIONSHIP.
- ( doorbell rings )

01:06.947 --> 01:08.778
MY DAD'S A LITTLE
TRICKY, SO LET ME WAIT

01:08.779 --> 01:10.150
TILL THE RIGHT MOMENT
TO TELL HIM, OKAY?

01:10.151 --> 01:11.741
WHEN HE'S IN A RECEPTIVE MOOD,

01:11.742 --> 01:14.115
I WILL DEFINITELY EASE HIM
INTO IT, LIKE A WARM BATH.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.997
PUMPKIN, GIVE ME A HUG!

01:17.998 --> 01:18.869
JOE'S MY BOYFRIEND!

01:18.870 --> 01:20.581
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO ABOUT IT!

01:23.624 --> 01:25.505
HEY, RUSSELL, WHAT'S UP?

01:25.506 --> 01:26.966

01:46.397 --> 01:48.067
Mel: LOOK, JOE AND I NEVER
THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

01:48.068 --> 01:49.029
IT REALLY JUST KINDA
CREPT UP ON US.

01:49.030 --> 01:50.530
YEAH, IT WAS A TOTAL SURPRISE.

01:50.531 --> 01:52.111
HONESTLY, NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS
THAT I THINK I WOULD END UP

01:52.112 --> 01:55.074
WITH, UH... (
chuckles ) THIS ONE.

01:55.075 --> 01:57.287
- OKAY, TOO FAR.
- IT WAS... OKAY.

01:57.288 --> 01:59.579
WELL, IT'S NOT
EXACTLY A SHOCKER.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.122
FRANKLY, I THOUGHT YOU'D BEEN
TIPPING THE HELP SINCE DAY ONE.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.295
WAIT WAIT WAIT. YOU THOUGHT JOE
AND I WERE ALREADY A THING?

02:05.296 --> 02:08.007
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
HIRE THIS FINE-LOOKING

02:08.008 --> 02:10.590
YET TOTALLY UNQUALIFIED
YOUNG BUCK

02:10.591 --> 02:12.842
TO LOOK AFTER MY GRANDCHILDREN?

02:12.843 --> 02:17.016
THANK YOU, RUSSELL. THAT
WAS LIKE 60% COMPLIMENT.

02:17.017 --> 02:18.928
WELL, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP,

02:18.929 --> 02:23.102
BECAUSE I AM A FULLY-GROWN,
31-TO-35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.

02:23.103 --> 02:25.104
WHO LOOKS 28.

02:25.105 --> 02:27.687
ALL KIDDING ASIDE, MEL,

02:27.688 --> 02:30.400
I THINK YOU GOT
YOURSELF A GOOD MAN.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.822
YOU DO? YOU REALLY DO?

02:32.823 --> 02:34.944
AW. THANK YOU, DADDY.

02:34.945 --> 02:36.326
OH, YOU KNOW, IF YOU
WERE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW,

02:36.327 --> 02:37.488
THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT VISIT.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.491
I HAVE TO SAY, HONEY,
DINNER TONIGHT

02:41.492 --> 02:43.543
WITH YOUR FATHER WAS
ACTUALLY TOLERABLE.

02:43.544 --> 02:44.954
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:44.955 --> 02:48.338
HE WAS SWEET, POLITE,
RESTRAINED...

02:48.339 --> 02:49.380
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

02:50.791 --> 02:52.131
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:52.132 --> 02:55.965
UM, LOOKING UP THE SYMPTOMS
OF LATE-STAGE SYPHILIS.

02:55.966 --> 02:59.058
HONEY, I THINK HE JUST HAS
EARLY-STAGE GETTING OLD.

02:59.059 --> 03:00.179
YOU KNOW,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.971
SOMETIMES WHEN GUYS
GET A LITTLE OLDER,

03:01.972 --> 03:03.062
CERTAIN LEVELS START TO DROP,

03:03.063 --> 03:05.515
AND THE OLD LION
BECOMES LESS CONCERNED

03:05.516 --> 03:07.977
WITH TAKING DOWN THE GAZELLE,
AND IS HAPPY TO JUST

03:07.978 --> 03:10.770
SIT IN THE SUN AND SEE HOW
WELL HIS PROGENY ARE DOING.

03:10.771 --> 03:13.112
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING
"THE LION KING" AGAIN?

03:13.113 --> 03:14.654
( chuckles )

03:14.655 --> 03:16.276
THERE'S A LOT OF
DEEP STUFF IN THERE.

03:16.277 --> 03:18.278
JUST 'CAUSE IT'S A CARTOON
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT

03:18.279 --> 03:19.490
SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE.

03:20.741 --> 03:22.121
SO MY HISTORY TEACHER
WAS TELLING ME

03:22.122 --> 03:24.083
THAT THERE'S A SECRET BUNKER
UNDER THE CAPITOL BUILDING

03:24.084 --> 03:27.206
FOR THE SENATORS, IN
CASE THE WORLD ENDS.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.918
WELL, YOUR HISTORY TEACHER
SHOULDN'T BE MAKING

03:28.919 --> 03:31.130
RIDICULOUS CLAIMS...

03:31.131 --> 03:33.132
BUT, YES, IT'S THERE.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.885
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED
FOR REBUILDING CIVILIZATION.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.177
BOOZE AND FERTILE YOUNG LADIES.

03:38.178 --> 03:39.179
( laughs )

03:40.180 --> 03:41.141
I'M KIDDING.

03:41.142 --> 03:43.012
ORRIN HATCH MADE US
GET RID OF THE BOOZE.

03:43.013 --> 03:44.934
WE HAD SOME GREAT
PARTIES DOWN THERE.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.976
I SURE DO MISS MY SENATE DAYS.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.309
AHH, IT'S REASSURING TO KNOW
THAT AFTER THE APOCALYPSE

03:49.310 --> 03:51.190
OUR SEXIST WAY OF
LIFE WILL CONTINUE.

03:51.191 --> 03:53.152
- ISN'T IT?
- OKAY, DAD,

03:53.153 --> 03:54.814
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS

03:54.815 --> 03:56.155
ABOUT MY STATE SENATE CAMPAIGN.

03:56.156 --> 03:58.948
OH, I JUST FORGOT. I
DON'T WANNA BE BORED.

03:58.949 --> 04:00.950
OKAY. GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.

04:00.951 --> 04:02.952
( scoffs ) HOW RUDE IS HE?!

04:02.953 --> 04:05.074
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
GO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT,

04:05.075 --> 04:07.367
AND IF IT MEANS I MISS
OUT ON THIS, WELL...

04:07.368 --> 04:09.669
MY LOSS.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.130
OKAY, SO I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

04:11.131 --> 04:13.212
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE
CALLED, AND THEY SAID

04:13.213 --> 04:15.084
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE
HIM ON THE PLATFORM WITH ME

04:15.085 --> 04:16.876
WHEN I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY.

04:16.877 --> 04:18.928
WELL, LET ME CALL HIM RIGHT NOW

04:18.929 --> 04:21.090
AND WE WILL NAIL THIS BABY DOWN.

04:21.091 --> 04:23.092
- ( cellphone beeps )
- WOW, LOOK AT THAT PHONE, HUH?

04:23.093 --> 04:24.223
YOU KNOW, RUSS, WHEN
YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT,

04:24.224 --> 04:26.556
I'M SURE THE SMITHSONIAN
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.098
LAUGH IF YOU MUST, BUT
THIS OLD WORKHORSE

04:29.099 --> 04:31.190
HAS STOOD BY ME SINCE 1997.

04:31.191 --> 04:33.022
IF YOU WANNA REALLY HELP
MEL'S CAMPAIGN OUT,

04:33.023 --> 04:34.103
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A PHONE
THAT SENDS OUT TWEETS

04:34.104 --> 04:35.274
AND INSTAGRAM PHOTOS.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.237
WHOA WHOA WHOA. SLOW
DOWN THERE, BILL GATES.

04:38.238 --> 04:41.531
MY BRAND IS PRESSING THE FLESH.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.403
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WITH
MEL DOWN IN COLUMBUS

04:43.404 --> 04:45.405
FIVE DAYS A WEEK, HOW
ARE YOU TWO GONNA BE...

04:45.406 --> 04:47.076
- PRESSING THE FLESH?
- DAD!

04:47.077 --> 04:50.710
OHH, HONEY, COME ON. I'M NOT
JUST TALKING ABOUT SUGAR TIME.

04:50.711 --> 04:53.292
I MEAN THE... THE
WHOLE RELATIONSHIP.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.084
HOW ARE YOU TWO
GONNA MANAGE THAT?

04:55.085 --> 04:56.916
WELL, UM...

04:56.917 --> 04:59.298
YOU... YOU KNOW, WE ACTUALLY
HADN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YET.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.470
YOU'D REALLY BE GONE
FIVE DAYS A WEEK?

05:00.471 --> 05:03.683
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS FIRST
IN THE LEGISLATURE,

05:03.684 --> 05:05.685
I WAS THERE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.226
SOMEHOW, THOUGH, I MADE IT WORK.

05:07.227 --> 05:10.229
YEAH YEAH, MOM DRANK HERSELF
INTO AN EARLY FACELIFT

05:10.230 --> 05:12.101
AND, UH, YOU CHASED WOMEN.

05:12.102 --> 05:15.024
DIDN'T HAVE TO CHASE 'EM.

05:15.025 --> 05:16.816
I GUARANTEE YOU, RUSS, MEL AND
I ARE GONNA BE WORKING IT OUT

05:16.817 --> 05:17.937
A LOT DIFFERENTLY THAN THAT.

05:17.938 --> 05:19.439
YEAH YEAH, OF COURSE YOU WILL.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.740
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE?

05:20.741 --> 05:22.442
YOU COULD TAG ALONG WITH
MEL DOWN TO COLUMBUS.

05:22.443 --> 05:24.203
NO, I CAN'T BE TAGGING
ALONG ANYWHERE.

05:24.204 --> 05:25.785
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF BUILDING
A BUSINESS HERE IN TOLEDO.

05:25.786 --> 05:27.657
YEAH, BUT I WOULD HAVE
TO BE IN COLUMBUS

05:27.658 --> 05:28.788
PRACTICALLY FULL-TIME.

05:28.789 --> 05:30.370
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:30.371 --> 05:33.373
THIS MIGHT BE A POSITIVE.
ALL THAT TIME APART...

05:33.374 --> 05:35.585
MIGHT HELP KEEP THE
MYSTERY ALIVE.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.297
LIKE, "WHY ISN'T SHE
ANSWERING HER PHONE?"

05:38.298 --> 05:41.221
OR "WHO'S HE WITH TONIGHT?"

05:42.262 --> 05:44.554
YOU KNOW I'M JUST
MESSING WITH YOU?

05:44.555 --> 05:46.135
OH, WHY SO SERIOUS?

05:46.136 --> 05:47.558
OOH!

05:50.601 --> 05:52.061
LENNOX, LENNOX, LENNOX.

05:52.062 --> 05:53.102
CAN YOU PLEASE COME IN
HERE JUST FOR A MINUTE?

05:53.103 --> 05:54.394
- PLEASE?
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

05:54.395 --> 05:56.235
OKAY, SO I NEED TO COME
UP WITH A BUSINESS IDEA

05:56.236 --> 05:58.027
FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR'S
CLUB TOMORROW.

05:58.028 --> 06:00.319
OH, UH, HANG ON. I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF I CAN FIND SOMEONE WHO CARES.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.482
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.
THIS IS IMPORTANT, OKAY?

06:02.483 --> 06:04.243
JOE SAYS THAT I NEED
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD

06:04.244 --> 06:06.195
ON MY HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS.

06:06.196 --> 06:08.367
COLLEGES MAINLY LOOK
AT YOUR GRADES.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.249
THAT'S WHY I NEED
SOMETHING ELSE.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.452
SO THE FIRST IDEA...

06:12.453 --> 06:14.293
A BIG FOAM BALL, OKAY?

06:14.294 --> 06:15.374
WITH A SLOT IN IT,

06:15.375 --> 06:18.377
SO YOU CAN STICK YOUR
PHONE INSIDE THE SLOT,

06:18.378 --> 06:22.171
SO IF YOU DROP IT, IT'LL
BOUNCE RIGHT BACK UP TO YOU.

06:22.172 --> 06:24.714
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET?

06:24.715 --> 06:27.637
I GOT ANOTHER ONE...

06:27.638 --> 06:30.850
THIS IS A BIG FOAM BALL

06:30.851 --> 06:33.773
THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR DRINK IN.

06:33.774 --> 06:35.395
NEXT.

06:36.777 --> 06:37.777
OKAY.

06:37.778 --> 06:40.279
THIS ONE IS, UH... IT'S A PENCIL

06:40.280 --> 06:41.781
WITH AN ATTACHMENT ON THE END

06:41.782 --> 06:43.784
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO
PUT A CARROT ON.

06:44.945 --> 06:46.325
IT'S LIKE A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE

06:46.326 --> 06:48.288
FOR PEOPLE WHO CHEW
THEIR ERASERS.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.490
I LIKE IT.

06:50.491 --> 06:52.452
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.625
BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN STICK
IT IN A BIG FOAM BALL.

06:55.626 --> 06:57.417
( clears throat ) THAT'S THE
LAST TIME I ASK FOR YOUR ADVICE.

06:59.209 --> 07:00.300
PROMISE?

07:02.593 --> 07:04.423
OKAY, RUSSELL, SO...

07:04.424 --> 07:06.966
ALL YOUR CONTACTS FROM YOUR OLD
PHONE ARE NOW IN YOUR NEW PHONE.

07:06.967 --> 07:10.349
JOSEPH, I'M STILL NOT SEEING WHY
THIS IS SUCH A BIG IMPROVEMENT

07:10.350 --> 07:11.761
OVER MY FLIP PHONE.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.103
YEAH, AND I MISS MY BEEPER.

07:14.224 --> 07:15.975
LIFE GOES ON, MAN.
I MEAN, COME ON.

07:15.976 --> 07:17.356
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE HEADING DOWN
TO MEL'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS,

07:17.357 --> 07:19.188
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA TAKE
OUT YOUR FLIP PHONE

07:19.189 --> 07:21.400
AND CALL EVERYBODY ONE BY ONE AND LET
'EM KNOW YOU'RE GOING DOWN THERE?

07:21.401 --> 07:24.984
OR ARE YOU GONNA TAKE A SELFIE AND LET THE
WHOLE WORLD KNOW YOU'RE GOING DOWN THERE...

07:24.985 --> 07:26.065
INSTANTLY?

07:26.066 --> 07:27.657
A SELFIE?

07:27.658 --> 07:28.988
IT'S A PICTURE OF YOURSELF.

07:28.989 --> 07:30.740
( laughing ) OH!

07:30.741 --> 07:34.874
'CAUSE DOING A SELFIE MEANT
SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN MY DAY.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.746
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY TAKING ONE RIGHT NOW, 'KAY?
- OKAY.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.960
NOW, THE KEY TO A QUALITY SELFIE
IS MAXIMUM ARM EXTENSION.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.964
- OKAY?
- THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOUR ARMS ARE SO SHAPELY.

07:45.085 --> 07:46.296
I'M JUST SAYING.

07:47.928 --> 07:49.258
HERE WE GO. SMILE.

07:49.259 --> 07:50.640
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- BOOM. ALL RIGHT.

07:50.641 --> 07:52.261
Computerized female voice:
Russell, what can I do for you?

07:52.262 --> 07:54.353
WHAT?

07:54.354 --> 07:57.436
YEAH, PRESS THAT BUTTON RIGHT THERE AND
TELL HER TO "SEND PICTURE TO MEL."

07:57.437 --> 07:59.018
- TELL WHO?
- SISSY.

07:59.019 --> 08:00.600
YOU KNOW, LIKE "ASSISTANT."

08:00.601 --> 08:02.021
THAT'S YOUR NEW DIGITAL
SECRETARY RIGHT THERE.

08:02.022 --> 08:03.903
GO ON, PRESS THE
BUTTON AND TELL HER.

08:03.904 --> 08:05.194
( musical tone plays )

08:05.195 --> 08:08.067
SISSY, SEND THAT PICTURE TO MEL.

08:08.068 --> 08:13.112
Right away. And might I
add: nicely composed shot.

08:13.113 --> 08:16.115
WELL, THANK YOU, LITTLE LADY.

08:16.116 --> 08:18.117
ALTHOUGH IT WAS MOSTLY JOE.

08:18.118 --> 08:20.540
OH, MAN! YOU'RE JUST
MESSING WITH ME, RIGHT?

08:20.541 --> 08:22.792
WELCOME TO THE MODERN
WORLD, RUSSELL.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.585
SO I JUST SAY IT,
AND SHE DOES IT?

08:25.586 --> 08:27.176
YOUR IDEAL WOMAN, HUH?

08:27.177 --> 08:28.217
WOW, DAD.

08:28.218 --> 08:29.508
I AM IMPRESSED.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.510
YOU ALREADY LEARNED HOW
TO E-MAIL A PHOTO?

08:31.511 --> 08:32.392
SHE GOT OUR PICTURE!

08:32.393 --> 08:34.393
I DIDN'T EVEN PRESS A BUTTON!

08:34.394 --> 08:35.555
THAT IS AMAZING!

08:35.556 --> 08:36.766
IT'S IN...

08:36.767 --> 08:39.398
I'M GONNA HAVE SO MUCH
FUN WITH THIS THING!

08:39.399 --> 08:41.520
HEY, ARE YOU STILL
THERE, DARLIN'?

08:41.521 --> 08:45.144
DO ME A FAVOR... SEND
JOE BIDEN 50 PIZZAS!

08:45.145 --> 08:48.237
EXCITED ABOUT A PHONE.
THAT IS NOT MY FATHER.

08:48.238 --> 08:50.610
YEAH, WELL, MEL, YOUR
FATHER'S GETTING OLDER.

08:50.611 --> 08:52.612
YOU KNOW, LION AT SUNSET.

08:52.613 --> 08:55.114
CIRCLE OF LIFE, BABY.

08:55.115 --> 08:56.577
( blender whirring )

08:59.419 --> 09:02.582
HEY, MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER JUST WOKE
ME UP WITH THIS INCOHERENT TEXT.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.044
- CAN YOU MAKE ANY SENSE OUT OF THIS?
- YEAH, LET ME SEE.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.467
"RED ALERT: YOUR FATHER'S PEN
IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET."

09:08.468 --> 09:10.049
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
JANEY MEANS, BABE.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.131
- ( cellphone beeps )
- OH, IT'S ANOTHER ONE FROM JANEY.

09:12.132 --> 09:14.724
"WARN EVERYONE... DON'T
OPEN E-MAILS FROM RUSSELL."

09:14.725 --> 09:16.515
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

09:16.516 --> 09:18.097
I DO HAVE AN E-MAIL FROM HIM.

09:18.098 --> 09:19.478
( cellphones ring, vibrate )

09:19.479 --> 09:21.140
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST
GOT ONE FROM YOUR DAD TOO.

09:21.141 --> 09:23.272
OHH! ( gasps )

09:23.273 --> 09:25.354
WHAT? WHAT'S... WHAT'S THE...
OHH!

09:25.355 --> 09:28.147
OH. UM...

09:28.148 --> 09:31.570
JANEY DIDN'T MEAN WHAT'S ALL OVER
THE INTERNET IS YOUR FATHER'S PEN.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.613
IT'S HIS PENIS.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.785
THANKS, I HADN'T
PUT THAT TOGETHER.

09:35.786 --> 09:37.366
WHAT IS MY FATHER THINKING?!

09:37.367 --> 09:39.578
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
DID HE SEND THIS TO?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.371
HE SENT IT TO HIS ENTIRE
CONTACT LIST, BABE.

09:42.502 --> 09:43.582
WHICH MEANS WE GOTTA
GET TO THE KIDS.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.794
- THE KIDS!
- THE KIDS!

09:44.795 --> 09:46.796
LENNOX, RYDER, DON'T
LOOK AT YOUR E-MAILS!

09:46.797 --> 09:48.337
- Joe: DELETE!
- UNSUBSCRIBE!

09:48.338 --> 09:49.339
DELETE!

09:53.674 --> 09:55.845
OKAY, HERE'S THE SPIN
FOR DAMAGE CONTROL:

09:55.846 --> 09:58.267
RUSSELL DISCOVERED A WORRISOME
SPOT ON HIS PRIVATE AREA,

09:58.268 --> 10:00.891
AND HE WAS TEXTING THE PHOTO
TO HIS DERMATOLOGIST.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.483
HE SENT THE PICTURE TO
2,000 PEOPLE, JANEY.

10:04.484 --> 10:06.896
HE WANTED A SECOND OPINION.

10:06.897 --> 10:10.319
SURE, EVERYONE WILL BUY THAT.
ALONG WITH HIS SNAPPY CAPTION...

10:10.320 --> 10:12.611
"THINKING OF YOU KEEPS
ME UP ALL NIGHT."

10:12.612 --> 10:14.613
I DON'T THINK HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT HIS INSOMNIA.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.196
WELL, THERE GOES MY
STATE SENATE CAMPAIGN

10:17.197 --> 10:19.999
AND ANY CHANCE I HAD OF EVER
MAKING IT TO WASHINGTON.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.701
MEL, YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT
IS TWO DAYS AWAY.

10:21.702 --> 10:24.704
WE JUST NEED TO SHIFT FOCUS BACK
TO YOUR VISION FOR OHIO'S FUTURE.

10:24.705 --> 10:26.335
WELL, HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT

10:26.336 --> 10:29.548
WHEN EVERYONE'S VISION IS ON
A CLOSE-UP OF MY DAD'S...

10:29.549 --> 10:31.340
- KICKSTAND?
- ( door opens )

10:31.341 --> 10:32.672
MORNING, EVERYBODY!

10:32.673 --> 10:35.514
WELL, LOOK AT YOU GUYS...
HARD AT WORK ALREADY.

10:35.515 --> 10:38.718
ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOUR
DELIGHTFUL SELF-PORTRAIT

10:38.719 --> 10:40.680
MADE ITS WAY AROUND
THE ENTIRE WORLD?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.472
YEAH, HOW 'BOUT THAT?

10:43.643 --> 10:44.854
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE?

10:44.855 --> 10:47.106
I THINK I NEED ANOTHER
LESSON ON THIS BABY.

10:47.107 --> 10:49.479
WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT A COUPLE
OF PALM TREES BEHIND IT NEXT TIME?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.821
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

10:51.822 --> 10:53.612
YOU KNOW, IT'S A...
IT'S A FUNNY STORY.

10:53.613 --> 10:55.484
I WAS IN A HOTEL LAST NIGHT,

10:55.485 --> 10:57.156
AND MY LADY FRIEND EVELYN,

10:57.157 --> 11:00.659
SHE E-MAILED ME A RATHER PROVOCATIVE
PHOTO OF HERSELF, SO...

11:00.660 --> 11:04.083
LIKE A GENTLEMAN,
I RECIPROCATED.

11:04.084 --> 11:07.246
I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU
REMEMBERED YOUR MANNERS.

11:07.247 --> 11:08.627
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD,
WHERE I COME FROM,

11:08.628 --> 11:11.050
MANNERS NEVER INVOLVE THE
SOUNDS "ZIP" AND "FLOP."

11:11.051 --> 11:12.381
BUT, YOU KNOW,

11:12.382 --> 11:13.592
IT'S DIFFERENT
UPBRINGINGS, I GUESS.

11:13.593 --> 11:16.756
SENATOR, HOW DID YOU
MANAGE TO SEND THE PHOTO

11:16.757 --> 11:19.218
TO 2,000 INBOXES?

11:19.219 --> 11:21.600
WELL, I SAID, "SEND TO EVELYN."

11:21.601 --> 11:24.433
BUT SISSY MUST HAVE THOUGHT
I SAID, "SEND TO EVERYONE."

11:24.434 --> 11:26.355
IT'S CLOSE. IT'S REAL CLOSE.

11:26.356 --> 11:27.857
SHE'S FICKLE, SISSY.

11:27.858 --> 11:29.398
( cellphone rings )

11:29.399 --> 11:30.569
HOLY CRAP!

11:30.570 --> 11:31.981
OH, THIS ISN'T ANYTHING.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.943
HOW BAD IS IT?

11:33.944 --> 11:35.865
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO MY CAMPAIGN?

11:35.866 --> 11:37.616
OH, NO, HONEY. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:37.617 --> 11:39.078
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

11:39.079 --> 11:41.700
SOME CONGRESSMAN
WILL PROPOSITION

11:41.701 --> 11:43.282
AN UNDERCOVER COP IN A BATHROOM,

11:43.283 --> 11:44.994
AND THE REPORTERS WILL
FORGET ALL ABOUT US.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.786
OH, YEAH. OR MAYBE
IT'LL RAIN FROGS.

11:46.787 --> 11:47.997
YOU KNOW, LIKE IN THE BIBLE.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.790
WELL, THERE YOU GO!
PEOPLE LOVE THE BIBLE!

11:50.791 --> 11:53.002
HEY, LISTEN. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

11:53.003 --> 11:55.044
I'VE ALMOST FINISHED WITH THE
SPEECH THAT THAT I'M GONNA DELIVER

11:55.045 --> 11:56.595
WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE
YOUR CANDIDACY.

11:56.596 --> 12:00.719
AND ALL MODESTY ASIDE, I'M
VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT I HAVE.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.721
EVIDENTLY.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.722
DAD, WAKE UP.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.804
YOU CAN'T ANNOUNCE ME.

12:04.805 --> 12:06.515
BUT, PUMPKIN, I...

12:06.516 --> 12:08.898
I FLEW IN TO BE THERE
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.729
AND WHAT WOULD WE HAVE
DONE IF YOU DIDN'T?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.941
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:11.942 --> 12:13.983
I WAS VERY HAPPY
WITH MY FLIP PHONE

12:13.984 --> 12:16.405
UNTIL SOMEONE INSISTED
THAT I UPGRADE

12:16.406 --> 12:18.277
TO THE DEVIL'S PLAY THING HERE!

12:18.278 --> 12:20.619
OH, I SEE. SO FIRST
YOU'RE BLAMING THE PHONE,

12:20.620 --> 12:22.992
AND NOW YOU'RE BLAMING ME? REMIND ME,
WAS I IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM LAST NIGHT

12:22.993 --> 12:23.993
PULLING DOWN YOUR PANTS?!

12:23.994 --> 12:26.996
I DON'T KNOW! I WAS DRUNK!

12:26.997 --> 12:29.168
THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

12:29.169 --> 12:31.791
HE'S SUDDENLY NO LONGER AVAILABLE
FOR YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.502
NO REASON GIVEN.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.505
OH, I'M SURE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR UNFORTUNATE PHOTO OP.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.967
LOOK, YOU MAY NOT
HAVE THE GOVERNOR,

12:37.968 --> 12:41.010
BUT YOU STILL HAVE OHIO'S
MOST BELOVED EX-SENATOR.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.012
SHE WAS REALLY HOPING THAT
THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE THERE.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.474
WELL, TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE
WHO HAS BEEN THERE.

12:45.475 --> 12:48.517
POLITICS IS ALL ABOUT
OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.890
OHH, AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO
PROVIDE THE OBSTACLES.

12:50.891 --> 12:52.771
I GET IT NOW! OH.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.564
THANKS, DADDY.

12:56.656 --> 12:58.818
LENNOX, DON'T YOU
HAVE CLASSES TODAY?

12:58.819 --> 13:01.610
( sighs ) YEAH, BUT THERE'S
LIKE SIX REPORTERS ON OUR LAWN.

13:01.611 --> 13:03.612
I'M NOT EXACTLY PSYCHED
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE,

13:03.613 --> 13:06.745
"HEY, LITTLE GIRL, IS THIS
YOUR GRANDPA'S GOOD SIDE?"

13:06.746 --> 13:08.998
- HEY, GUYS.
- AND WHY ARE YOU HOME SO EARLY?

13:08.999 --> 13:11.330
OH, THE PRINCIPAL SAID
I WAS A "DISTRACTION."

13:11.331 --> 13:13.122
AND APPARENTLY, SOMEONE
THOUGHT THAT I MISSED

13:13.123 --> 13:14.964
THE WHOLE GRANDPA PHOTO THING,

13:14.965 --> 13:17.676
SO THEY PUT A COPY
OF IT ON MY LOCKER.

13:17.677 --> 13:20.299
POSTER-SIZED...

13:20.300 --> 13:23.092
WITH EYES AND A MUSTACHE.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.885
AND THEY WERE SHOOTING
NERF DARTS AT IT.

13:25.886 --> 13:28.137
WOW, I'M GLAD EVERYONE'S SO SENSITIVE
TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

13:28.138 --> 13:31.350
HEY, YOU CAN USE THIS TIME TO COME UP WITH
AN IDEA FOR YOUR ENTREPRENEUR'S CLUB.

13:31.351 --> 13:33.062
YEAH, HOW ABOUT A TIME MACHINE,

13:33.063 --> 13:35.855
SO I CAN GO BACK AND SUPERGLUE
GRANDPA'S PANTS ON.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.236
YOU KNOW,

13:37.237 --> 13:39.358
IF I WEREN'T ABOUT TO
ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY,

13:39.359 --> 13:41.240
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
BECOME SUCH A HUGE DEAL.

13:41.241 --> 13:42.942
NOW YOU GUYS ARE HAVING
TO PAY THE PRICE.

13:42.943 --> 13:44.113
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH IT.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.325
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.907
WELL, MAYBE THIS ISN'T
THE BEST TIME FOR ME

13:47.908 --> 13:49.038
TO BE RUNNING FOR STATE SENATE.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.749
AUNT MEL, ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:50.750 --> 13:51.830
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT WHOLE SCANDAL

13:51.831 --> 13:54.213
BETWEEN OUR FATHER AND
OUR JAILBIRD MOTHER?

13:54.214 --> 13:56.665
WE WERE THE "SCANLON
BRATS" FOR YEARS.

13:56.666 --> 13:58.217
WE'LL BE OKAY.

13:58.218 --> 14:00.719
AW, HONEY. HOW'D YOU
GET TO BE SO BRAVE?

14:00.720 --> 14:04.924
WELL, THERE'S SOMEONE I RESPECT WHO SETS
AN INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE FOR ME TO FOLLOW.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.385
- AW, LENNOX.
- I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,

14:06.386 --> 14:08.388
HAVE YOU HEARD KATY
PERRY'S NEW ALBUM?

14:12.893 --> 14:14.603
HEY, I'M SORRY YOU GOT
DRAGGED INTO THAT, JOE.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.775
I MEAN, MY FATHER WAS WAY
OUT OF LINE TO BLAME YOU.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.437
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD
HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.

14:18.438 --> 14:21.901
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. YOU KNOW
YOUR DAD CAN'T RESIST ANY WOMAN.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.073
NOT EVEN ONE WITHOUT A BODY.

14:24.074 --> 14:26.075
YOU KNOW, LENNOX AND
RYDER ARE SO GREAT.

14:26.076 --> 14:27.746
I MEAN, WITH ALL THE CRAP
THEY'RE HAVING TO PUT UP WITH,

14:27.747 --> 14:30.159
THEY'RE STILL ON BOARD
WITH MY CAMPAIGN.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.912
I'M JUST NOT SO SURE
THAT I'M STILL ON BOARD.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.833
REALLY?

14:34.834 --> 14:38.207
WELL, YEAH. EVEN THOUGH, I SEEM TO
BE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS ANY DOUBTS.

14:38.208 --> 14:42.841
- WELL, MAYBE NOT THE ONLY ONE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:42.842 --> 14:47.426
WELL, HON', YOU KNOW, I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOUR DAD WAS SAYING YESTERDAY.

14:47.427 --> 14:50.429
YOU KNOW, THAT IF YOU WIN, YOU'RE
GONNA BE IN COLUMBUS FULL-TIME.

14:50.430 --> 14:52.271
AND, OF COURSE, I'M GONNA BE STUCK
HERE GETTING LONGO FIT OFF THE GROUND.

14:52.272 --> 14:54.473
AND WE'RE JUST STARTING
OUT AS A COUPLE.

14:54.474 --> 14:57.066
AND THAT KIND OF DISTANCE
COULD REALLY, YOU KNOW...

14:57.067 --> 14:58.227
MESS THINGS UP.

14:58.228 --> 15:00.859
OH, I SEE. SO YOU'RE
NOT SUPPORTIVE

15:00.860 --> 15:02.611
OF MY STATE SENATE RUN.

15:02.612 --> 15:05.824
NO. NO, YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
HAS THE DOUBTS, RIGHT?

15:05.825 --> 15:07.196
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU CAME IN HERE?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.408
NO. OBVIOUSLY, I CAME IN

15:09.409 --> 15:11.201
TO INDIRECTLY ASK
YOU FOR A PEP TALK.

15:12.993 --> 15:14.493
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY THAT THEN?

15:14.494 --> 15:15.914
UH, BECAUSE IF I HAD
TO ASK DIRECTLY,

15:15.915 --> 15:16.956
THAT WOULD RUIN THE WHOLE THING.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.127
RIGHT NOW

15:18.128 --> 15:19.128
YOU SHOULD BE SAYING,

15:19.129 --> 15:20.299
"DON'T DOUBT YOURSELF.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.300
YOU'RE STRONG. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

15:21.301 --> 15:22.541
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING."

15:22.542 --> 15:24.543
OH, I SEE. SO YOU WANT ME TO...

15:24.544 --> 15:26.805
PRETEND THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANY DOUBTS?

15:26.806 --> 15:29.638
YES! BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE DOUBTS,
THEN I CAN'T HAVE DOUBTS.

15:29.639 --> 15:31.680
I MEAN, COUPLES ARE
SUPPOSED TO TAKE TURNS.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.052
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE TALKING ME OFF A LEDGE,

15:33.053 --> 15:35.434
NOT YELLING "JUMP JUMP JUMP!"

15:35.435 --> 15:37.356
I'M NOT YELLING "JUMP
JUMP," ALL RIGHT?

15:37.357 --> 15:39.558
I'M JUST REMINDING YOU THAT YOU
HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT THERE.

15:39.559 --> 15:43.022
AND JUMPING IS ONE OF THEM.

15:43.023 --> 15:44.563
YOU KNOW WHAT ANOTHER ONE IS?

15:44.564 --> 15:45.564
NOW TALKING TO YOU!

15:45.565 --> 15:47.026
MEL.

15:47.027 --> 15:48.617
ARE YOU... HONEY!

15:48.618 --> 15:49.948
COME ON! LOOK, YOU'RE STRONG.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.910
YOU'RE... YOU'RE...
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

15:50.911 --> 15:51.911
YOU CAN... YOU CAN...

15:51.912 --> 15:53.032
OH, GOD. WHO AM I KIDDING?

15:53.033 --> 15:54.874
I'M NOT EVEN LISTENING TO ME.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.921
READ THIS, AND TELL ME
IT'S NOT A GREAT SPEECH.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.383
WHY ARE YOU SHOWING THIS TO ME?

16:04.384 --> 16:07.216
WELL, SO SOMEONE CAN APPRECIATE
WHAT I DO FOR MY DAUGHTER.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.389
MEL DOESN'T WANT ME
INVOLVED AT ALL.

16:15.055 --> 16:16.435
IT'S AMAZING.

16:16.436 --> 16:21.020
I KNOW, RIGHT? SCHOOL KIDS
SHOULD HAVE TO MEMORIZE THAT.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.861
I MEANT HOW
SELF-INVOLVED YOU ARE.

16:22.862 --> 16:24.193
COME ON, MAN.

16:24.194 --> 16:26.365
MEL'S ANNOUNCING HER
CANDIDACY TOMORROW.

16:26.366 --> 16:28.817
AND FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE, YOU
NEED TO PUT ASIDE YOUR EGO

16:28.818 --> 16:31.280
AND JUST BE THERE FOR HER THE
WAY SHE NEEDS YOU TO BE.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.373
YOU OWE HER THAT MUCH.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.206
WE ALL DO.

16:37.207 --> 16:38.617
- ( cellphone dings )
- Sissy: Russell,

16:38.618 --> 16:41.120
here are your reminders
for this evening.

16:41.121 --> 16:43.001
Buy flowers for Mel,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.085
and schedule dinner
with prostitute.

16:47.217 --> 16:48.927
( laughs uncomfortably )

16:48.928 --> 16:51.720
THAT SISSY MISHEARS EVERYTHING.

16:51.721 --> 16:53.932
I BELIEVE I SAID...

16:53.933 --> 16:56.305
"PROTESTANT."

16:56.306 --> 16:58.097
YOU REALLY WANT
TO HELP, RUSSELL?

16:58.098 --> 16:59.138
OF COURSE.

16:59.139 --> 17:01.310
BUY THE FLOWERS.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.273
CANCEL THE PROTESTANT.

17:09.489 --> 17:11.700
WHOA, WHAT'S ALL THIS?

17:11.701 --> 17:14.113
THIS IS MY IDEA FOR THE
ENTREPRENEUR'S CLUB.

17:14.114 --> 17:16.325
CHECK THIS OUT.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.617
"THINKING OF YOU KEEPS ME

17:18.618 --> 17:20.419
UP ALL NIGHT"?

17:20.420 --> 17:22.371
CHA-CHING.

17:22.372 --> 17:26.465
THIS RIGHT HERE IS GONNA BE THE BIGGEST-SELLING
T-SHIRT SINCE "I'M WITH STUPID."

17:26.466 --> 17:29.758
YEAH, BUT YOU ARE KINDA
SELLING OUT GRANDPA.

17:29.759 --> 17:31.430
NO. NO NO NO.

17:31.431 --> 17:33.302
GRANDPA DID THIS
TO HIMSELF, OKAY?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.344
HE EMBARRASSED US.
THIS IS JUST PAYBACK.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.386
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ALSO
SELLING OUT AUNT MEL.

17:37.387 --> 17:38.847
IF HER CAMPAIGN IS
GONNA HAVE A CHANCE,

17:38.848 --> 17:40.179
THIS WHOLE THING
NEEDS TO BLOW OVER.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.640
AND, UM,

17:41.641 --> 17:43.942
THIS ISN'T HELPING.

17:43.943 --> 17:46.315
YEAH, WELL, GENIUS
IDEAS LIKE THIS

17:46.316 --> 17:48.066
DO NOT COME ALONG
EVERY DAY, OKAY?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.650
WHAT ABOUT THAT AWESOME
CELLPHONE IN A FOAM BALL IDEA?

17:51.651 --> 17:52.651
YOU SAID THAT SUCKED.

17:52.652 --> 17:55.284
GREAT IDEAS ARE
ALWAYS LAUGHED AT

17:55.285 --> 17:57.496
AT FIRST.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.328
LOOK AT... LOOK AT
THE WRIGHT BROTHERS

17:59.329 --> 18:01.460
AND... AND GANDHI...

18:01.461 --> 18:03.752
AND "DANCING WITH THE STARS."

18:03.753 --> 18:07.256
OKAY, WELL, THIS T-SHIRT WILL
DEFINITELY MAKE ME THE $100 I NEED

18:07.257 --> 18:10.169
TO STAY IN THE CLUB, SO
IS THAT REALLY SO WRONG?

18:10.170 --> 18:12.341
EH, I DON'T WANNA
JUDGE YOU IN ANY WAY.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.973
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU
THINK IS RIGHT.

18:14.974 --> 18:16.715
AND THEN WHEN YOU DIE,

18:16.716 --> 18:18.428
ENJOY HELL.

18:21.481 --> 18:22.891
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

18:22.892 --> 18:25.724
WELL, BELIEVE IT. THESE TWEETS ABOUT
YOU ARE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.

18:25.725 --> 18:26.725
LOOK.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.437
OH! OH.

18:28.438 --> 18:32.321
SORRY, I JUST HAVE
POST-TRAUMATIC SEXTING DISORDER.

18:32.322 --> 18:34.533
AFTER YOUR FATHER'S
SELFIE, WE TOOK A POLL.

18:34.534 --> 18:36.235
AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S
AN INCREDIBLE SURGE

18:36.236 --> 18:38.116
- IN SYMPATHY FOR MEL BURKE.
- ( door opens )

18:38.117 --> 18:42.331
YEAH, PEOPLE FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN UNFAIRLY
TARRED BY YOUR FATHER'S INDISCRETION.

18:42.332 --> 18:45.164
THE RESULTS ARE:
PEOPLE LOVE YOU, MEL.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.746
YOU'RE WELCOME, PUMPKIN.

18:47.747 --> 18:49.168
( cellphone dings )

18:49.169 --> 18:50.959
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.011
I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

18:53.012 --> 18:55.344
IT TURNS OUT HE'S
SUDDENLY AVAILABLE

18:55.345 --> 18:56.925
FOR US. WOW.

18:56.926 --> 18:58.677
THIS FLIP HAS FLOPPED.

18:58.678 --> 18:59.888
HA HA HA.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.261
I GOTTA GO LOCK
HIM IN RIGHT NOW.

19:02.262 --> 19:04.473
WOW, THOSE ARE AMAZING NUMBERS.

19:04.474 --> 19:05.974
SWEETHEART,

19:05.975 --> 19:07.396
YOUR CAMPAIGN IS
READY TO LAUNCH.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.397
YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.028
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

19:10.029 --> 19:12.531
DOES MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER
STILL HAVE ANY DOUBTS?

19:12.532 --> 19:15.153
JOE?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.535
MEL, I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

19:16.536 --> 19:18.076
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
RUN FOR STATE SENATE.

19:18.077 --> 19:20.909
- YOU STILL DON'T?
- I THINK YOU SHOULD RUN FOR CONGRESS.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.701
ISN'T THERE GOING TO BE AN
OPEN SEAT NEXT YEAR, RUSSELL?

19:22.702 --> 19:27.085
YES, PAT GEARY'S RETIRING. THE SEAT
FOR THIS DISTRICT IS UP FOR GRABS.

19:27.086 --> 19:29.588
WH... WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM?

19:29.589 --> 19:33.382
COME ON, HONEY. YOU ALWAYS SAID
YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL WAS WASHINGTON.

19:33.383 --> 19:35.424
CONGRESSWOMAN BURKE.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.465
IT'S GOT A PRETTY NICE RING
TO IT, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

19:36.466 --> 19:38.467
OH-HO-HO, I'D VOTE FOR THAT.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.510
IN FACT, I'D PAY HOMELESS
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THAT.

19:41.511 --> 19:42.511
OKAY, DON'T DO THAT.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.303
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

19:44.304 --> 19:46.104
WELL, JOE, THAT IS REALLY SWEET.

19:46.105 --> 19:47.306
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:47.307 --> 19:49.308
WASHINGTON IS A LOT FURTHER
AWAY THAN COLUMBUS.

19:49.309 --> 19:51.230
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE
GONNA MAKE IT WORK.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.612
IT'S OVER A YEAR FROM NOW. OUR RELATIONSHIP
WILL BE A LOT STRONGER BY THEN.

19:53.613 --> 19:56.114
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? LONGO FIT
WILL BE NATIONWIDE BY THEN.

19:56.115 --> 19:58.156
SO I'M GONNA BE SPENDING A
LOT OF TIME IN D.C. MYSELF.

19:58.157 --> 20:00.198
YEAH, WELL, I CAN TRIM THE
FAT OUT OF THE BUDGET,

20:00.199 --> 20:01.410
YOU CAN TRIM THE FAT OUT
OF THE POLITICIANS.

20:01.411 --> 20:02.781
YEP!

20:02.782 --> 20:05.454
YOU TWO ARE GONNA BE THE
ULTIMATE POWER COUPLE.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.456
COME ON, LET'S GET A PICTURE
OF ALL THREE OF US TOGETHER.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.458

20:09.459 --> 20:11.250

20:11.251 --> 20:12.252
ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.834
OH! OH, GOD.

20:15.835 --> 20:19.428
YOU SCROLLED BACK
TOO FAR, HONEY.

20:19.429 --> 20:21.009
WE'RE CANCELLING YOUR PLAN.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.642
NO...

20:25.345 --> 20:27.145
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE SHIRTS?

20:27.146 --> 20:28.767
THROWING THEM AWAY.

20:28.768 --> 20:30.269
ALONG WITH ALL THAT MONEY
I WOULD HAVE MADE.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.691
THANKS FOR GUILTING ME.

20:32.692 --> 20:34.693
ANYTIME.

20:34.694 --> 20:36.064
LOOK, YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

20:36.065 --> 20:39.278
WHERE DID THESE COME FROM?

20:39.279 --> 20:41.159
I'M NOT GONNA LIE, GRANDPA.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.992
THOSE JUST SHOWED UP
ON OUR FRONT DOORSTEP.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.324
NO.

20:45.325 --> 20:47.286
HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE
MONEY, BUT HE REALIZED

20:47.287 --> 20:49.077
IT WAS IN POOR TASTE,
AND CHANGED HIS MIND.

20:49.078 --> 20:51.129
YOU WERE GONNA CHARGE
PEOPLE FOR THESE?

20:51.130 --> 20:53.712
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M ASHAMED.

20:53.713 --> 20:56.755
ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.339
THESE WILL MAKE GREAT
CHRISTMAS GIFTS.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.260
MY FANS WILL THINK
THEY'RE FUNNY.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.932
HELL, SO WILL MY ENEMIES.

21:03.933 --> 21:06.975
EITHER WAY, IT KEEPS
MY FACE OUT THERE.

21:06.976 --> 21:09.648
HEY, BETTER YOUR FACE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

21:09.649 --> 21:12.060
DOES YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
TAKE CHECKS?

21:12.061 --> 21:14.192
'CAUSE I WANNA BUY ALL OF THEM.

21:14.193 --> 21:16.395
- YOU MEAN IT?
- YEAH.

21:16.396 --> 21:18.026
( chuckles ) I'M GONNA BE

21:18.027 --> 21:20.238
THE BIGGEST MONEYMAKER AT
THE ENTREPRENEUR'S CLUB.

21:20.239 --> 21:21.279
THANKS, GRANDPA.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.492
YEAH, THANKS, GRANDPA,
FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID

21:23.493 --> 21:24.824
TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE.
