WEBVTT

00:08.775 --> 00:10.310
Morning!

00:10.410 --> 00:11.411
How'd you sleep?

00:11.511 --> 00:13.113
Okay.

00:13.213 --> 00:16.383
You're lying, Victoria Joan.

00:16.483 --> 00:20.820
It's just it's been two days
and Darby won't return my call.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.492
She'll come around.
Give her some time.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.394
I said some awful things, Billy.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.495
You told her the truth.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.030
I don't think
she was ready to hear it.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.398
Well, she's a grown-up!

00:31.498 --> 00:33.233
With a car, and a business,

00:33.333 --> 00:35.068
and a pizza loyalty card.

00:35.168 --> 00:39.539
I just never wanted to
destroy her image of her father.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.709
You didn't destroy it,
you clarified it.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.077
There's a difference.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.881
I don't know, I...

00:47.981 --> 00:51.017
What's this?

00:51.117 --> 00:54.354
"A true masterpiece."
Is this from our first date?

00:54.454 --> 00:55.655
Oh, hey, hey, just--

00:55.755 --> 00:56.856
What?
It's...

00:56.956 --> 00:58.324
Careful with that!

00:58.425 --> 01:00.527
Okay...

01:00.627 --> 01:02.762
It's just this is, um...

01:04.697 --> 01:07.934
This photo's valuable.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.836
Oh!

01:09.936 --> 01:14.407
Uh, I'm s...
I'm sorry.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.242
I'm an idiot.
I overreacted.

01:16.342 --> 01:19.145
There's been a lot of
that going around.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.480
Look, why don't
you call Darby?

01:20.580 --> 01:23.917
Who knows,
maybe she's ready to talk.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.187
Okay.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.766
Whoa,
am I in the Upside-Down?

01:39.866 --> 01:42.602
Darby Spencer actually
woke up before me?

01:42.702 --> 01:45.972
Hey.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.240
I couldn't sleep.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.508
Does it still count?

01:48.608 --> 01:49.609
Mm-hm!

01:49.709 --> 01:52.412
It is so beautiful here.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.481
How could you have hated
coming here as a kid?

01:54.581 --> 01:55.982
Well, my dad had a strict

01:56.082 --> 01:57.951
"no video games" rule
at the cottage.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.419
But, uh...

01:59.519 --> 02:00.753
I fixed that!

02:00.854 --> 02:02.755
Nice!
- Yeah, thanks.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.525
With this view,
he was onto something.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.393
I could stay here forever.

02:07.494 --> 02:08.561
Yeah, about that.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.264
I was sorta thinking
we could head back today.

02:11.364 --> 02:12.866
Things are piling up
at the winery

02:12.966 --> 02:15.301
and the reception's
terrible up here.

02:15.401 --> 02:17.036
We can't leave yet!

02:17.137 --> 02:19.339
Weren't you just saying
how beautiful it is?

02:19.439 --> 02:21.841
Don't you think it's time you
sorted things out with your mom?

02:21.941 --> 02:22.976
No!

02:23.076 --> 02:25.311
She lied to me
about my dad for 16 years

02:25.411 --> 02:27.280
and wrote all about it
in her first book.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.848
Mm, parents lying
to their children?

02:28.948 --> 02:32.352
Yeah, no, I-I know
nothing about that...

02:32.452 --> 02:34.854
I'm just saying,
she had her reasons.

02:34.954 --> 02:37.457
You can't discount
everything good she's done

02:37.557 --> 02:39.225
because of one big lie.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.127
Someone very wise
once told me that.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.495
Oh, okay...

02:45.165 --> 02:48.434
Do you have some kind of
neural link with her?

02:48.535 --> 02:51.070
Des, trust me.
It's for the best.

02:51.171 --> 02:55.508
My mom and I are never,
ever getting back together.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.043
- Okay.
- Ever.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.745
Mm-hm.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.714
[voicemail] Hey,
you've reached Darby Spencer

03:01.814 --> 03:04.884
of The Spencer Sisters
Detective Agency.

03:04.984 --> 03:07.220
She probably isn't up yet.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.056
Listen, there's a gallery
showing up at Cedar Ridge today.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.524
Young Iranian artist.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.759
You'd love her.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.027
Why don't we head up there?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.895
Sure.

03:18.598 --> 03:19.632
- Come with me, quick!
- What?

03:19.732 --> 03:21.201
- Quick, quick, quick!
- What is it? What--

03:21.301 --> 03:22.335
- Come on!
- What is it?

03:22.435 --> 03:23.469
- Go, go!
- Who is it?

03:23.570 --> 03:24.571
What's happening?
Where?

03:24.671 --> 03:25.572
Go, go!

03:27.507 --> 03:28.841
- Get in, get in!
- What?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.310
Whatever you do, stay quiet!

03:30.410 --> 03:32.745
Whatever happens,
don't say a word.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.252
Oh, hey, look,
it's the goon squad.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.054
Okay...

03:41.154 --> 03:42.188
Oof!

03:46.492 --> 03:47.694
Oww!

03:49.028 --> 03:51.898
Well, James, here we are again.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.802
Hey, Vasily.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.737
To what do I owe the pleasure?

03:57.837 --> 03:59.939
Where is The Alchemist?

04:00.039 --> 04:01.074
Alchemist?

04:01.174 --> 04:03.543
I don't know.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.980
Make him talk, please.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.648
What?

04:12.018 --> 04:13.753
Seriously?!

04:13.853 --> 04:15.888
Fine, search the place.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.209
Hey!

04:36.309 --> 04:39.045
Help me with this.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.688
It's, uh...
It's not here.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.258
No, I suppose James
is much smarter than that.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.794
Bring him.
Let's go.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.896
Let's go!

05:14.681 --> 05:16.582
Please...

05:16.683 --> 05:18.284
I need your help.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.804
The leader,
his name, I think was, uh...

05:37.904 --> 05:41.541
Vasily, and, um, they--
they called Billy "James"!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.376
Okay, okay, okay,
slow down, slow down.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.911
You're safe now, alright?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.412
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.215
I didn't want to disturb you
but there was no one else

05:49.315 --> 05:50.249
I could turn to.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.451
Yeah, no, of course.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.652
- Huh?
- Oh, thank you.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.320
Okay,
did you call the police?

05:54.420 --> 05:56.155
No!
We can't call the police.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.857
These men are
definitely dangerous.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.659
There's no telling
what they would do to Billy

05:59.759 --> 06:01.427
if they knew
the police were involved.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.463
- So, what do you want to do?
- I don't know.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.198
We need to find out
everything about them.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.966
Whatever Billy is mixed up in,

06:07.066 --> 06:09.402
we have to figure out
what that is, and...

06:09.502 --> 06:11.070
You could track
his phone, right?

06:13.606 --> 06:15.541
- What?
- So, so, Victoria...

06:15.641 --> 06:17.443
I have to tell you something,

06:17.543 --> 06:19.278
and you're not gonna like it.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.713
You were looking into Billy.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.548
- You know?
- Yeah, I saw a text.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.684
Darby and I had
a horrible fight about it.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.352
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.720
No, no, no, no,
it's fine.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.689
Now I know you were
just looking out for me.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.758
Yeah.
Look, the point is this.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.259
I was tracking Billy's phone

06:33.359 --> 06:35.395
and this was a long time ago,
you know?

06:35.495 --> 06:37.730
But he's got some sort of
location blocker on it,

06:37.830 --> 06:39.031
and it's...

06:39.132 --> 06:40.433
very sophisticated.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.701
Oh, no.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.870
No, what are we gonna do?
I...

06:43.970 --> 06:46.406
Can you tell me everything
that you have on Billy?

06:46.506 --> 06:49.041
Yeah.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.944
"Billy West"
appears to be an alias,

06:52.044 --> 06:53.446
but I found
pretty clear evidence

06:53.546 --> 06:54.781
that he's used other names.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.049
Apparently "James"
is one of them.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.085
Uh-huh.

06:59.185 --> 07:03.122
You know, I hacked
into Interpol's audio files.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.591
- Uh-huh?
- This one's pretty interesting.

07:05.691 --> 07:08.728
Okay.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.797
Alright...

07:23.376 --> 07:25.144
Ugh!

07:25.244 --> 07:26.279
What do you want?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.748
Your text messages
got me in a lot of trouble.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.883
Alastair?

07:30.983 --> 07:33.119
[indistinct] home...
Can you hear me?

07:33.219 --> 07:34.954
No, I can't.
I can't really.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.522
You're breaking up.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.425
You need to come home.
Billy's been kidnapped!

07:39.525 --> 07:41.894
Kidnapped?!
What?

07:41.994 --> 07:44.697
- Is my mom okay?
- Yes, she is safe.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.799
A bunch of men
broke in and they...

07:46.899 --> 07:48.401
Billy...

07:48.501 --> 07:51.003
Well, Alastair,
I can't hear you.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.141
Hello?

07:55.241 --> 07:56.342
Ugh!

07:56.442 --> 07:58.845
This is a waste of time.
I can't understand anything!

07:58.945 --> 08:01.280
It's impossible to tell
what's true and what isn't!

08:01.380 --> 08:03.115
Welcome to my world.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.484
We have to go to Billy's house.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.085
There must be something there
that could tell us

08:06.185 --> 08:07.487
what they were looking for.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.156
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Victoria,
that is too dangerous!

08:10.256 --> 08:11.791
I am not asking
your permission!

08:11.891 --> 08:12.959
And I'm not asking yours!

08:13.059 --> 08:14.694
Okay, it's time
to call the police.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.995
Look, I'm here to help,

08:16.095 --> 08:20.533
but I'm not gonna let you
put your life at risk.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.768
Yeah!

08:29.542 --> 08:33.346
Okay, wait, wait, just
let me get this straight, okay?

08:33.446 --> 08:35.481
You witnessed a kidnapping
and then waited, what,

08:35.581 --> 08:37.817
three hours before
calling the police?

08:37.917 --> 08:40.419
If it were up to me,
I would have waited another day.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.387
A joke!

08:41.487 --> 08:43.155
Wow, that's funny.
She's funny, right?

08:43.256 --> 08:45.191
How'd you like to be
locked up for obstruction?

08:45.291 --> 08:47.994
I'd probably still solve
the case faster than you.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.729
Easy, Victoria.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.397
And who are you
supposed to be?

08:51.497 --> 08:53.399
I work in IT.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.535
He's in IT.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.537
You know, every time
the Spencer Sisters show up,

08:57.637 --> 08:59.405
- I get a migraine.
- Oh.

08:59.505 --> 09:03.175
Graham, do me a favour and get
these two out of my crime scene.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.176
Come on, Vic.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.012
I see your allegiance
is elsewhere.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.114
We'll let ourselves out.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.694
Huh.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.130
Careful with that!

09:28.367 --> 09:30.970
What do you...?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.939
Let's go.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.206
Okay.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.910
What did
he say about it?

09:38.010 --> 09:40.379
It's not so much what he said,
it's what he did.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.481
It's like he didn't
want me to touch it.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.616
This is strange.

09:43.716 --> 09:44.984
These are torque screws.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.285
It's very unusual.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.487
Torque screws?
Ugh...

09:48.588 --> 09:52.358
What has Billy
gotten himself mixed up in?

09:52.458 --> 09:54.360
I hope he's okay.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.262
Whoa...

10:00.232 --> 10:01.267
What?!

10:01.367 --> 10:02.602
- Whoa.
- Those are...

10:02.702 --> 10:05.137
Passports.
Six of them.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.306
- Oh my God.
- Alright, alright, alright.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.141
You and Darby were right.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.443
Billy was a fraud!

10:10.543 --> 10:13.112
Well, you know,
I wouldn't jump to conclusions.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.648
Alastair,
what other conclusion is there?

10:15.748 --> 10:19.619
- I'm a fool!
- Let's just check this out.

10:27.493 --> 10:28.928
Nothing.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.663
These all have
the same passport number,

10:30.763 --> 10:34.166
except for this one:
"James Wolfe."

10:34.266 --> 10:37.036
James, that's the name
that thug, Vasily, called him.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.039
That must be his real name.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.210
James Wolfe...

10:44.310 --> 10:46.145
"An art authenticator
for a British museum

10:46.245 --> 10:48.914
"wanted in connection with
the murder of a gallery owner

10:49.015 --> 10:50.316
-"in Brussels."
- Murder?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.018
No, that--
that's not possible.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.419
It can't be him.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.256
Oh, my...

11:05.364 --> 11:07.933
Help!

11:08.034 --> 11:08.968
Help!

11:22.314 --> 11:26.218
Shall we try this again, James?

11:26.318 --> 11:29.922
I already told you--

11:30.022 --> 11:31.557
I don't know where
The Alchemist is.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.898
What, are you gonna--
you gonna shoot me now?

11:38.998 --> 11:41.067
Like Jason in Brussels?

11:43.102 --> 11:44.336
I have a better idea.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.273
Give me his phone.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.712
Let's see.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.080
Hmm?

11:54.180 --> 11:56.415
Come on.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.086
- Gah!
- Nice.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.889
Who's Victoria Spencer?

12:03.989 --> 12:05.524
She's innocent.
Leave her out of this.

12:05.624 --> 12:06.859
Mm, not so innocent.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.563
You've called her
more than 100 times.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.897
No, no!

12:11.997 --> 12:12.898
No!
No!

12:12.998 --> 12:14.400
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!
- Ugh!

12:18.971 --> 12:21.507
- It's him!
- Oh!

12:24.643 --> 12:26.245
Billy, are you okay?

12:26.345 --> 12:29.148
Hello, Victoria!

12:29.248 --> 12:31.083
Who is this?
And where is Billy?

12:31.183 --> 12:33.252
I think you mean James?

12:33.352 --> 12:36.889
He's fine, but what happens
next depends on you.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.292
Bring me The Alchemist
by 6 pm tomorrow, or Billy,

12:40.392 --> 12:44.230
or James, or whatever
his name is this week, dies.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.731
I'll send you the location.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.133
But I don't know where it is.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.101
- I-I don't--
- 6 pm!

12:49.201 --> 12:51.670
And if you speak
to the police...

12:51.771 --> 12:53.839
you'll never see him again.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.577
Seems like I came home
at the right time.

13:01.080 --> 13:01.113
ed

13:01.113 --> 13:01.147
ed.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.984
Don't.
I'm still mad at you.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.986
I'm here for the case.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.255
Of course.
I would have expected no less.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.589
So who's this "Alchemist"?

13:10.689 --> 13:12.958
It's not a person.

13:13.058 --> 13:16.829
We found all of these passports
that Billy was using.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.231
We think that his real name
was James Wolfe.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.600
He was an art authenticator.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.102
What?

13:23.202 --> 13:25.070
So "The Alchemist"
is a work of art?

13:25.171 --> 13:28.007
And Billy stole it?
Or "James" did?

13:28.107 --> 13:29.041
We're not sure.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.709
We think it's more
complicated than that.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.379
Well, looks like there
are a bunch of paintings here

13:33.479 --> 13:36.348
called "The Alchemist."
Look.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.450
Everything
from Dutch masters

13:38.551 --> 13:40.953
to modern pictographs.
But these are all in museums.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.355
So why would these guys
think Billy has it?

13:43.455 --> 13:46.926
I don't know, but we need
to talk to an art expert.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.661
But who?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.830
Hmph, "The Alchemist"!

13:50.930 --> 13:53.032
The Elvis of the art world.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.901
Every year,
someone claims to have found it,

13:56.001 --> 13:58.437
and invariably
it's discovered to be a fake.

13:58.537 --> 13:59.905
But what is it?

14:00.005 --> 14:03.409
Oh, it's a painting
in the Vermeer style

14:03.509 --> 14:07.313
by an unknown artist
of the Delft School.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.848
Hmm, it was lost during
the Second World War

14:08.948 --> 14:11.250
when the Nazis raided
several private collections.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.585
Let me see...

14:12.685 --> 14:14.186
Okay, listen,
if it's so famous,

14:14.286 --> 14:15.821
how come we couldn't find it?

14:15.921 --> 14:18.390
Well, you were looking for it
under the wrong name.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.392
It's not actually called
"The Alchemist."

14:20.492 --> 14:21.760
That's just a nickname.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.264
Now, where is it?

14:25.364 --> 14:28.868
Ah, here we go.

14:28.968 --> 14:31.937
There you are.

14:32.037 --> 14:36.375
Its actual name is "Lady
and Gentleman with Flagon."

14:36.475 --> 14:37.943
It was nicknamed "The Alchemist"

14:38.043 --> 14:40.145
because of the artist's
incredible ability

14:40.246 --> 14:42.081
to re-create light.

14:42.181 --> 14:45.084
It was like they were
creating gold out of lead paint.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.719
Okay, but where is it?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.287
We need to find this painting.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.388
Uh, I'm sorry?

14:49.488 --> 14:50.789
Billy was kidnapped

14:50.890 --> 14:52.925
by a group of men
who are after the painting.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.494
They're holding him hostage
until we turn it over to them.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.463
Apparently
Billy was lying to me.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.399
He's really an art authenticator
for a British museum

15:00.499 --> 15:02.067
and he's implicated
in the murder

15:02.167 --> 15:06.605
of an art gallery owner
in Brussels.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.641
You...

15:08.741 --> 15:12.344
were dating a murderer?

15:12.444 --> 15:15.648
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

15:15.748 --> 15:20.152
Oh, well, I suppose
it's a lot less glamorous

15:20.252 --> 15:21.687
in real life, no doubt.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.323
At any rate, it makes sense.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.626
I mean, art authenticators
are frequently brought in

15:27.726 --> 15:29.595
to vet private sales,

15:29.695 --> 15:31.797
especially when stolen
paintings are involved,

15:31.897 --> 15:33.399
to make sure
the buyer is getting

15:33.499 --> 15:34.833
what they actually paid for.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.537
It's a lucrative side business.

15:38.637 --> 15:43.642
But if Billy really got away
with "The Alchemist"...

15:43.742 --> 15:45.678
it could be worth...

15:45.778 --> 15:48.213
millions.

15:50.516 --> 15:51.650
This is hopeless!

15:51.750 --> 15:53.986
We may as well just
throw darts at a map.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.988
Not necessarily.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.157
Billy clearly knew
that Vasily and his men

15:58.257 --> 15:59.792
would come after him one day.

15:59.892 --> 16:00.926
I mean, if I were him,

16:01.026 --> 16:03.429
I would keep my one piece
of leverage close.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.331
Duly noted,
but it doesn't change the fact

16:05.431 --> 16:08.534
that he lied to me, that he's
an international art thief,

16:08.634 --> 16:10.069
and perhaps a murderer,

16:10.169 --> 16:12.204
and I don't even know
his real name!

16:12.304 --> 16:14.807
Okay, I get it.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.675
You tried to warn me,
but I wouldn't listen.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.210
That's not what
I was gonna say!

16:18.310 --> 16:20.179
Okay, then some version of
"I told you so."

16:20.279 --> 16:22.481
I was going to say...

16:22.581 --> 16:23.816
I'm sorry.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.751
But you've ruined it now.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.957
If it's any consolation,
I was off the mark, too.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.892
I thought he was trying
to steal your money.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.928
I wish he had.

16:36.028 --> 16:39.231
Instead, he just...
stole my heart.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.201
Lucas?

17:16.301 --> 17:18.437
Oh, no...

17:18.537 --> 17:19.805
No, no, no!

17:19.905 --> 17:23.375
Oh, fff...

17:25.044 --> 17:26.345
Lucas!

17:26.445 --> 17:27.613
Hey!

17:27.713 --> 17:29.615
The wink emoji?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.283
You've got game, Spencer.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.185
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.320
That text was meant for Des.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.222
Ah, yeah.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.590
How are you doing?

17:38.690 --> 17:42.061
Since my near-fatal injection
last time that we hung out,

17:42.161 --> 17:43.328
you mean?

17:43.429 --> 17:47.066
Yeah, that wasn't
totally my fault, per se...

17:47.166 --> 17:48.367
Well, I'm good.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.969
I'm back at work.
On the night shift, no less.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.806
I'm surprised Lindsay
left you out of her sight.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.307
She seemed pretty worried.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.542
Yeah.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.078
But, you know, life goes on.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.947
She's out buying confetti bombs
for the wedding right now.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.282
Confetti bombs?

18:03.382 --> 18:06.285
Yeah, she wants it to rain down
confetti all over the crowd

18:06.385 --> 18:07.986
once it's official, and then...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.955
Yeah, don't get me started.
It's a whole thing.

18:10.055 --> 18:13.492
Okay!

18:13.592 --> 18:15.794
- You okay?
- Me?

18:15.894 --> 18:18.430
Yeah.
Um... sure.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.332
I dunno, things are kind of...

18:20.432 --> 18:22.134
hard these days.

18:22.234 --> 18:25.037
"No masterpiece was ever
created by a lazy artist."

18:25.137 --> 18:26.438
What?

18:26.538 --> 18:28.340
It's what my dad
used to say to me

18:28.440 --> 18:30.008
when I was in my residency.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.045
I was working 90 hours a week.
I was worried about flunking.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.780
I found it super annoying
at the time,

18:34.880 --> 18:37.783
but later it kinda made sense.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.886
Masterpiece.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.155
Darby?

18:43.255 --> 18:44.156
Are you there?

18:44.256 --> 18:45.357
Yeah, I'm here.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.493
You just gave me an idea.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.928
I gotta go!

18:52.965 --> 18:57.035
Mom, why would Billy
frame this photo of you?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.037
Oh, I don't know.
Because he was fond of me?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.873
Plus, I do look great.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.642
-"A true masterpiece."
- Well, okay, fine.

19:03.742 --> 19:04.977
He sometimes went overboard...

19:05.077 --> 19:08.013
No, but that's a really
weirdly specific word

19:08.113 --> 19:09.381
to describe somebody.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.283
A "masterpiece"?
Who says that?

19:11.383 --> 19:13.886
I don't know,
it depends upon the person.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.387
Okay, yes, yes, I get it.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.122
You think that there's
a clue about the painting.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.223
I do.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.126
Where was this photo taken?

19:21.226 --> 19:22.861
Our first date.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.030
At Antonio's.

19:28.967 --> 19:32.137
Antonio!
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.406
Victoria, Darby, what...
what is it?

19:34.506 --> 19:36.875
Uh,
there's no time to explain!

19:36.975 --> 19:39.745
Ah, no, there's nothing here!

19:39.845 --> 19:41.246
What are
you looking for?

19:41.346 --> 19:42.481
Did you forget something?

19:42.581 --> 19:43.615
No, I--

19:43.715 --> 19:45.417
Do these tables
get moved around ever?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.618
All the time.

19:46.718 --> 19:47.819
Doesn't make sense.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.987
It wouldn't be
something movable.

19:49.087 --> 19:52.024
It would be fixed,
like permanent.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.493
Does Billy ever
come here on his own?

19:54.593 --> 19:56.628
Billy?
Every morning.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.697
He's the first one here
before the morning rush.

19:58.797 --> 19:59.898
Where does he sit?

19:59.998 --> 20:03.268
He always orders a double
espresso and sits right...

20:03.368 --> 20:06.004
here.

20:08.140 --> 20:12.277
Oh my gosh...

20:12.377 --> 20:13.612
There's something here!

20:13.712 --> 20:14.780
What is it?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.816
I don't know, it's taped.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.989
Ah, it's a key.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.058
Except we have no idea
what it opens.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.593
Speak for yourself.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.461
I have one just like it.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.098
It's for a security deposit box
at the Bank of Alder Bluffs.

20:37.302 --> 20:37.336
ho

20:37.336 --> 20:37.369
hoa,

20:37.369 --> 20:37.402
hoa, w

20:37.402 --> 20:37.436
hoa, who

20:37.436 --> 20:37.469
hoa, whoa.

20:37.469 --> 20:37.502
hoa, whoa...

20:38.870 --> 20:41.506
You want to break into a safety
deposit box at the bank?

20:41.607 --> 20:42.941
Don't be so dramatic!

20:43.041 --> 20:45.611
We are not gonna break in.
They are going to let us in!

20:45.711 --> 20:46.945
Why would they ever do that?

20:47.045 --> 20:48.513
Because I'm one of
their best customers.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.949
Oh my God, if that is not
the voice of privilege,

20:51.049 --> 20:52.050
I don't know what is.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.152
Relax! Bryn Martell
pulled off a similar gag

20:54.253 --> 20:57.022
in my sixteenth book,
"The Actuary's Abduction."

20:57.122 --> 20:59.458
Okay, first of all,
Bryn Martell--

20:59.558 --> 21:01.693
don't freak out--
is made up.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.962
So when she gets caught,
she just has to seduce

21:04.062 --> 21:05.130
the prison guard or something.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.065
Well, actually,
it was a penal colony,

21:07.165 --> 21:08.967
and she had to
convince the ferryman.

21:09.067 --> 21:09.901
Thank you.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.570
Mom, if you and I get caught,

21:11.670 --> 21:13.739
we have to face very
not-made-up consequences.

21:13.839 --> 21:14.873
What about Billy?

21:14.973 --> 21:17.042
If we don't recover
that painting by 6 pm,

21:17.142 --> 21:18.977
Vasily is going to kill him.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.847
- How is that for consequences?
- Ugh...

21:21.947 --> 21:25.584
If this goes badly, I'm not
sharing a cell with you!

21:28.754 --> 21:31.757
Victoria Spencer!
How lovely to see you again.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.059
I'm a big fan of
your mother's work.

21:34.159 --> 21:37.195
My favourite is
"The Actuary's Abduction."

21:37.296 --> 21:39.564
Oh, yeah!
That one is...

21:39.665 --> 21:41.800
unbelievable!

21:41.900 --> 21:43.101
Yes!
Oh, well, actually,

21:43.201 --> 21:45.003
we're in a bit of a rush, so I--

21:45.103 --> 21:46.905
Oh, you haven't
been here for a while,

21:47.005 --> 21:49.908
so I don't think you know,
but we have a new policy.

21:50.008 --> 21:52.844
Um, we take the key
and we bring the box to you now.

21:52.944 --> 21:57.115
It's more secure.
And, uh, can you believe it?

21:57.215 --> 22:00.452
Some people were trying
to access the wrong box!

22:03.155 --> 22:04.323
Crazy!

22:04.423 --> 22:06.992
Well, that sounds really
complicated and time-consuming,

22:07.092 --> 22:08.293
so we should
probably reschedule.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.895
Oh, it'll just take
an extra second.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.463
Do you have your key?
Mm-hm.

22:11.563 --> 22:14.066
Box number 55, as I recall?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.600
Georgina, you're so smart!

22:15.701 --> 22:19.404
Well, actually,
um, I got another one, 136.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.839
It's my lucky number,

22:20.939 --> 22:23.408
and Blair set me up
with it so...

22:23.508 --> 22:25.844
Oh, I see.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.079
Blair.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.748
Well, I'll have to speak
with her since, of course,

22:29.848 --> 22:31.817
she should have
checked with me first.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.652
I didn't mean to
cause any trouble.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.053
Mm-hm...

22:35.153 --> 22:37.622
I'll be right back.

22:40.726 --> 22:41.793
What are you doing?

22:41.893 --> 22:43.995
She's gonna go
talk to Blair after this!

22:44.096 --> 22:45.897
No! Blair and Georgina
hate each other.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.300
I have been
observing them for years.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.301
This is a bank!

22:49.401 --> 22:50.736
These are people who work here.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.337
They're not
characters in your novel!

22:52.437 --> 22:55.440
- Well, they could be.
- Oh, pfft...

22:55.540 --> 22:59.911
Here you are, box 136.

23:03.248 --> 23:06.051
Oh!

23:06.151 --> 23:09.788
I'm sorry.
I'll leave you to it.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.992
I can't believe that worked!

23:15.260 --> 23:16.862
Holy cow!

23:16.962 --> 23:18.196
Do you think that's
"The Alchemist"?

23:18.296 --> 23:20.298
We don't have time to check.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.100
Wait,
there's something else here.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.069
Grab it, let's go.

23:26.605 --> 23:29.541
So,
is anyone going to open it?

23:30.776 --> 23:32.010
- Okay, I will.
- Right.

23:32.110 --> 23:34.513
I will.

23:34.613 --> 23:36.681
Phew!

23:39.351 --> 23:41.586
Whoa...

23:48.293 --> 23:50.529
It's beautiful.

23:50.629 --> 23:54.166
Help me with it.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.636
Careful.

23:57.736 --> 24:01.006
Oh my gosh,
that should be in a museum.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.942
Whoa,
you should take a look at this.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.016
That's the guy that took Billy!

24:11.116 --> 24:13.084
Vasily Kosikov.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.486
He lives in London.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.788
He's the son of a Russian
oligarch and he inherited

24:16.888 --> 24:19.024
his father's
private equity group.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.525
What's that file,
the video file?

24:20.625 --> 24:23.094
- Open that.
- Yeah.

24:33.939 --> 24:36.007
That's "The Alchemist."

24:36.107 --> 24:41.213
That must be the sale that Billy
was hired to authenticate.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.681
Wait,
what's going on here?

24:42.781 --> 24:43.849
Wait-- what?

24:43.949 --> 24:45.083
Yeah, whoa--

24:45.183 --> 24:46.084
Whoa, oh my God!

24:46.184 --> 24:48.820
Oh my God.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.658
Whoa!

24:55.861 --> 24:58.296
You see,
Billy isn't a murderer.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.066
Well, it's not entirely
evident from that video.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.767
It's not enough proof
to clear his name.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.603
It's probably why
he didn't turn himself in.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.706
Yeah, he's on the run
from both the law and Vasily.

25:07.806 --> 25:08.707
Yeah.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.242
Anyway, we have the painting.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.978
- We have to contact Vasily.
- What?!

25:13.078 --> 25:15.814
Mom, you can't just walk up
to a guy who kills people

25:15.914 --> 25:17.249
and turn over a stolen painting.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.750
Well, I agree,
it's not ideal...

25:18.850 --> 25:20.051
"Not ideal"?

25:20.151 --> 25:21.953
Not ideal is running
out of toothpaste.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.321
This is a lot bigger than that.

25:23.421 --> 25:24.823
Well, then what do you propose?

25:24.923 --> 25:26.525
I propose that
we go to the police

25:26.625 --> 25:27.659
and we tell them everything.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.461
Yes, she's right, Victoria.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.997
No, Vasily explicitly said
not to do that!

25:32.097 --> 25:34.733
And why would we go to all
the trouble to get this painting

25:34.833 --> 25:36.434
if we weren't gonna
make the trade?

25:36.535 --> 25:39.404
- Look, I know you're upset...
- Billy's life is at stake!

25:39.504 --> 25:42.007
And your life, and mine!

25:42.107 --> 25:44.309
We can bargain.
I can convince them.

25:44.409 --> 25:46.478
You can't convince them.
You're delusional!

25:46.578 --> 25:48.647
Is this about the fight
that we had and the secret

25:48.747 --> 25:50.749
- that I kept from you?
- Are you serious right now?

25:50.849 --> 25:52.317
There is no way,
under any circumstances,

25:52.417 --> 25:55.153
that I am letting you
put yourself in harm's way.

25:55.253 --> 25:56.288
End of story.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.622
I'm calling Zane.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.795
Victoria...

26:03.895 --> 26:04.829
Yep, okay.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.398
Yep, okay, yep!

26:13.305 --> 26:17.008
Stolen painting,
false passports, Nazi looters?

26:17.108 --> 26:19.177
Yes, and we're still
filling in the details.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.780
But we were able to get
into Billy's safety deposit box.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.114
How?

26:23.214 --> 26:24.983
Is that really what matters
right now, Detective?

26:25.083 --> 26:27.352
Oh, so we're back to this,
are we?

26:27.452 --> 26:29.287
We found this.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.722
Go ahead.

26:30.822 --> 26:31.823
Uh...

26:37.963 --> 26:40.031
Just be careful with it
'cause it's...

26:40.131 --> 26:41.399
it's fragile.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.368
Right.

26:48.873 --> 26:51.543
Is this some sort of joke?

26:53.378 --> 26:55.046
Oh, no...

26:55.146 --> 26:57.515
Mom?
Mom!

26:57.616 --> 27:00.185
[voicemail] You've
reached Victoria Spencer.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.921
Shoot!

27:08.493 --> 27:11.196
[voice] "Sorry,
darling, but I had no choice.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.531
"PS, There's potato
salad in the fridge."

27:13.632 --> 27:16.635
What?

27:21.106 --> 27:24.009
Okay...

27:24.109 --> 27:26.845
Messages, messages...

27:26.945 --> 27:29.514
"Billy, are you okay?
I have it."

27:29.614 --> 27:32.517
"Come alone."

27:32.617 --> 27:35.153
Oh my God.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.978
Ah, that's funny.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.180
Real funny.
Who did this?

28:02.280 --> 28:04.382
Huh?

28:04.482 --> 28:05.750
Ah...

28:09.754 --> 28:11.056
Detective, you got a minute?

28:11.156 --> 28:12.524
Yeah.

28:12.624 --> 28:13.792
I've been looking
into Darby's claims

28:13.892 --> 28:15.660
about a stolen painting...

28:15.760 --> 28:18.063
It seems there actually
is a missing painting nicknamed

28:18.163 --> 28:19.931
"The Alchemist" and the story
she told about the murder

28:20.031 --> 28:21.232
in Brussels is true as well.

28:21.332 --> 28:22.834
You know, let me stop
you right there, Graham.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.235
I don't want anything
to do with those two,

28:24.335 --> 28:25.704
and neither should you.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.639
Look, I hear you,
but I know Darby

28:27.739 --> 28:29.307
and she has good instincts.

28:29.407 --> 28:30.675
I thought you two
were on the outs.

28:30.775 --> 28:33.511
It's... temporary.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.714
Look, you want to be
a good detective, Graham?

28:35.814 --> 28:36.881
Yeah.

28:36.981 --> 28:40.285
Then you need to figure out
where your loyalties lie.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.521
You understand?

28:43.621 --> 28:44.489
Yes.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.496
Hey, Des.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.765
Hey,
I didn't hear back from you.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.533
Is Billy okay?
And your mom?

28:55.633 --> 28:58.503
Oh, you know, she always makes
a big deal out of everything.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.572
Listen,
can I call you back later?

29:00.672 --> 29:03.274
Sure.
Uh, everything okay?

29:03.374 --> 29:05.176
Yeah.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.881
I just want you to know
that the last few months

29:09.981 --> 29:14.786
have been really special
and I'm glad we reconnected.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.755
Ah, me too.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.857
I just wanted you to know that.

29:18.957 --> 29:22.160
- Take care, okay?
- Okay.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.274
Hey.

29:36.374 --> 29:38.409
Hey!
What are you doin' here?

29:38.510 --> 29:41.679
Well, my meetings finished early
so I thought I'd drop by.

29:43.081 --> 29:44.949
I have news!

29:45.049 --> 29:46.618
Kyle called me into his office.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.154
We have another
class action lawsuit,

29:49.254 --> 29:51.623
500 million in damages.

29:53.658 --> 29:57.095
He asked me to be
first chair again.

29:57.195 --> 30:00.165
Starting next week.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.967
What about the wedding?

30:03.067 --> 30:06.037
You know, with everything
that's been going on, I...

30:06.137 --> 30:08.473
I started to think maybe...

30:08.573 --> 30:10.508
we should...

30:10.608 --> 30:12.510
postpone?

30:12.610 --> 30:14.479
- Until spring.
- Postpone?

30:14.579 --> 30:16.681
What do you mean "with
everything that's going on"?

30:16.781 --> 30:18.216
Lucas, face it.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.018
You know things have been
different between us

30:20.118 --> 30:21.986
ever since...

30:24.789 --> 30:26.357
I feel like I'm
forcing you into this.

30:26.457 --> 30:28.326
You are not
forcing me into this.

30:28.426 --> 30:30.228
Then tell me not to
take the litigation.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.865
Tell me not to, and I won't.

30:38.469 --> 30:39.504
Uh...

30:42.407 --> 30:44.209
Well...

30:44.309 --> 30:45.610
I guess that's my answer.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.612
No, Lindsay.
Lindsay, no.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.480
I have to work late tonight.

30:49.581 --> 30:53.117
Don't wait up.

31:19.844 --> 31:21.346
What are you doing here?

31:21.446 --> 31:23.815
Zane, you need to hear this.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.183
Hi, Lucas.

31:25.283 --> 31:28.553
If anything happens to me,
if you don't hear from me again,

31:28.653 --> 31:32.290
I just want you to know
how much you mean to me.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.292
How much you've always meant.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.261
Take care!

31:36.361 --> 31:38.763
I tried calling her back;
she won't pick up.

31:38.863 --> 31:40.865
I tracked down Alastair.
He traced both their phones.

31:40.965 --> 31:42.133
Alastair,
Vic's tech guy?

31:42.233 --> 31:43.534
Yeah, he's outside.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.803
Darby and Victoria are
heading south towards Hamilton.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.973
What the hell is going on?

32:08.126 --> 32:11.195
Okay!

32:15.066 --> 32:18.503
What do you think I'm hiding,
a Kalashnikov?

32:23.775 --> 32:26.110
Billy!

32:26.210 --> 32:27.478
James!
I...

32:27.578 --> 32:30.882
I don't know what to call you!
I'm so glad you're safe!

32:30.982 --> 32:33.418
I can't believe you came.
You shouldn't have!

32:33.518 --> 32:36.087
Well, nonsense.
I wasn't gonna let you die!

32:36.187 --> 32:39.157
You don't understand.
he's gonna kill us both!

32:44.829 --> 32:47.365
You better have my painting.

33:14.559 --> 33:15.626
Is that my painting?

33:15.727 --> 33:18.663
- Of course.
- Let's see it.

33:24.068 --> 33:27.238
I can't believe it!

33:27.338 --> 33:29.173
I never thought
I would see it again!

33:29.273 --> 33:31.542
I'm not much
into the Dutch School,

33:31.642 --> 33:33.911
but I have to admit,
it's rather special.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.747
- Now hand it to me.
- No, uh-uh!

33:35.847 --> 33:38.216
Excuse me, we had a deal.

33:38.316 --> 33:39.717
Release Billy first.

33:39.817 --> 33:42.220
I admire your fortitude,
Ms. Spencer.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.823
But I'm afraid I have to
change the terms.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.261
You have cost me
two years of my life.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.830
The only mercy I'm going
to show you is killing you

33:52.930 --> 33:55.033
before I kill her!

33:55.133 --> 33:56.801
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.336
Stop!

33:58.436 --> 34:01.172
- What are you doing?
- It's very flammable...

34:01.272 --> 34:02.607
Untie him, now!

34:09.547 --> 34:11.883
I sure hope you know
what you're doing.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.818
Okay,
this is how it's gonna go!

34:13.918 --> 34:16.954
We're gonna back away slowly.
You're gonna put your guns down.

34:18.589 --> 34:19.590
You, handsy guy!

34:19.690 --> 34:21.225
You're gonna
follow us to the car.

34:21.325 --> 34:24.829
Victoria?
Small problem...

34:24.929 --> 34:26.130
Big problem...

34:27.698 --> 34:29.400
I'll take that painting now.

34:32.603 --> 34:36.007
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

34:36.107 --> 34:37.341
Stop!

34:37.442 --> 34:39.243
Easy.

34:39.343 --> 34:41.179
You're gonna wanna hear
what I have to say.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.213
Who are you?

34:42.313 --> 34:44.148
I'm Special Agent Bryn Martell

34:44.248 --> 34:46.084
from the Interpol
Art Recovery Program.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.619
And that painting is a fake!

34:48.719 --> 34:50.655
What are you talking about?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.758
This is Harriet Wingate-Pomeroy,

34:53.858 --> 34:56.694
one of the foremost
art forgers in the world.

34:56.794 --> 34:59.030
She's been working
with James for six months

34:59.130 --> 35:01.532
to create a perfect replica
of "The Alchemist,"

35:01.632 --> 35:03.801
indistinguishable
from the original.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.937
- Yes, and I--
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

35:06.037 --> 35:08.473
Harriet,
don't even think about it.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.374
We're doing this by the book.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.043
By the book...

35:12.143 --> 35:14.178
You understand?

35:14.278 --> 35:16.514
The point is,
no one has to die today.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.583
I have the original
"Alchemist" in this bag,

35:18.683 --> 35:20.952
recovered from
Harriet's studio this morning.

35:22.386 --> 35:24.589
And what's stopping me
from just shooting you as well

35:24.689 --> 35:26.057
and taking both
of the paintings?

35:26.157 --> 35:28.893
You won't do that, because if
I don't contact my supervisor

35:28.993 --> 35:30.428
in the next five minutes,

35:30.528 --> 35:32.363
the police are gonna
lock down this whole area

35:32.463 --> 35:34.365
and trap you like a rat.

35:34.465 --> 35:37.568
How lucky do you feel?

35:37.668 --> 35:39.403
Or there's another option.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.672
I propose a trade.

35:41.772 --> 35:43.875
You give me Harriet and James,

35:43.975 --> 35:46.043
two of Interpol's
most wanted criminals,

35:46.144 --> 35:48.045
and 2 million euros,

35:48.146 --> 35:50.681
transferred to
my bank account in Geneva,

35:50.781 --> 35:53.918
and in exchange, I will not
only give you "The Alchemist,"

35:54.018 --> 35:59.090
I will tell my supervisor that
you and I never saw each other.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.829
And how do I know
the real painting is in there?

36:04.929 --> 36:06.998
See for yourself.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.081
Everybody
on the ground now!

36:26.751 --> 36:29.754
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
On the ground now!

36:46.938 --> 36:49.340
Thank you.
You saved my life.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.475
It felt like
you could use a win.

36:51.576 --> 36:52.743
And you read my first book,

36:52.843 --> 36:54.645
"The Lepidopterist's Liability."

36:54.745 --> 36:57.715
That's how she knew
that Harriet Wingate-Pomeroy

36:57.815 --> 36:59.917
had a duffel bag
full of butterflies!

37:00.017 --> 37:02.820
Well, to be honest,
I read the Wikipedia summary

37:02.920 --> 37:04.255
after Candace gave me the book.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.857
But I will read it in full...

37:06.958 --> 37:08.693
I promise.

37:11.996 --> 37:12.029
:

37:12.029 --> 37:12.063
: No

37:12.063 --> 37:12.096
: No...

37:12.096 --> 37:12.196
: No...

37:12.196 --> 37:12.230
: No...
Ye

37:12.230 --> 37:12.263
: No...
Yes,

37:12.263 --> 37:12.296
: No...
Yes, m

37:12.296 --> 37:12.330
: No...
Yes, ma'

37:12.330 --> 37:12.363
: No...
Yes, ma'am

37:12.363 --> 37:12.396
: No...
Yes, ma'am.

37:14.498 --> 37:16.901
Yes, ma'am.
No... No, uh...

37:17.001 --> 37:19.604
No, no, not a problem at all.

37:19.704 --> 37:22.106
Okay, so they want to fly me
to Ottawa next week

37:22.206 --> 37:23.507
to meet with Interpol...

37:23.608 --> 37:25.176
and Scotland Yard.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.078
Huh, wow.
I'm sorry about that, sir.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.747
What? No.
No, no, this is fantastic news.

37:29.847 --> 37:32.416
This is the kind of arrest
that's gonna launch my career

37:32.516 --> 37:35.152
to the next level.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.021
And of course,
I'll mention how grateful I am

37:37.121 --> 37:40.091
for your assistance!

37:43.327 --> 37:46.197
I'm so sorry that
this has to end like this.

37:46.297 --> 37:49.767
Me too, but I have to answer
for my role in all of this.

37:49.867 --> 37:52.336
I can't run anymore.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.272
I understand.

37:54.372 --> 37:55.973
Everything on
the surface was a lie.

37:56.073 --> 37:59.010
But everything I felt for you...

37:59.110 --> 38:00.911
was real.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.414
In all my travels,

38:03.514 --> 38:06.984
you are the place in the world
that I love the most.

38:15.893 --> 38:18.129
Will we see each other again?

38:18.229 --> 38:21.365
Who knows what the future holds.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.636
Billy!

38:32.977 --> 38:35.313
Alastair, thank you so much!

38:35.413 --> 38:37.648
Zane told me you were
the reason they found us!

38:37.748 --> 38:39.483
I know you risked so much.
Thank you!

38:39.583 --> 38:40.685
Victoria, Victoria, I, um...

38:40.785 --> 38:41.986
I-I, um...

38:42.086 --> 38:44.555
I've been wanting to tell
you this for a long time,

38:44.655 --> 38:48.659
now, I, um...

38:48.759 --> 38:51.662
have taken up pickleball, huh!

38:51.762 --> 38:54.365
And... we should...

38:54.465 --> 38:55.566
we should play!

38:55.666 --> 38:56.734
Okay...

38:56.834 --> 38:59.503
Yeah!
Alright.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.180
Lucas!
I'm so sorry I called you.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.715
I'm so embarrassed. I...

39:10.815 --> 39:11.916
I don't know
what I was thinking.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.417
I shouldn't have
left that message

39:13.517 --> 39:16.620
and I don't know what I--

39:24.362 --> 39:27.631
Oh, God.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.167
I'm sorry. I...

39:30.267 --> 39:33.304
I should not have done that.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.284
Tread carefully.

40:20.384 --> 40:24.822
You might not like
everything you find in there.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.324
I think I'm ready for it.

40:29.994 --> 40:34.265
Mom, I really wish you
would have told me about Dad.

40:34.365 --> 40:36.400
I would have acted differently.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.370
I didn't realize how much
you sacrificed just to protect

40:39.470 --> 40:41.472
this image that I had of him,

40:41.572 --> 40:45.075
and how much crap
you took from me because of it.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.811
Ah...

40:46.911 --> 40:49.346
You didn't deserve that.

40:51.782 --> 40:56.420
That's why I think you
should go on this book tour.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.655
What?

40:57.755 --> 41:00.758
If you don't go,
and it's because of me,

41:00.858 --> 41:03.260
then I'm just doing the exact
same thing that he did:

41:03.360 --> 41:06.163
I'm holding you back from
reaching your fullest potential.

41:06.263 --> 41:08.199
But I'm not even sure
I want to go.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.301
It's months on the road,
and I have to pack

41:10.401 --> 41:13.704
all my shoes and--

41:13.804 --> 41:19.143
Even if you don't want to go,
you should go.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.045
What about the agency?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.981
The agency will be here
when you get back.

41:24.081 --> 41:28.319
And I will be, too.

41:38.929 --> 41:41.265
Okay, let's not go crazy here...

41:44.602 --> 41:47.771
Thank you.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.807
I'll call Sarita.

41:49.907 --> 41:52.309
Good.
