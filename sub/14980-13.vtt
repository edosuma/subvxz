It’s easier for him to
by to mold in his image.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.631
Is there a reason you’re here?

02:13.718 --> 02:15.583

02:36.449 --> 02:38.405
My Wife’s mother is dead

02:38.534 --> 02:42.322
My house is gone.
This case is a top priority
for us, Mr. Ambrose.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.701
So why hasn’t anything been done?
Why isn’t that son ofa bitch in jail?

02:49.128 --> 02:51.540
She’s asking for you.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.626
I want Garcia behind bars.

02:54.717 --> 02:57.504
He thinks you know
who started the ﬁre?

02:57.595 --> 02:59.677
Well, I have a witness
who sawjack Garcia...

02:59.764 --> 03:03.177
running from the Ambrose house
right after the fire started.

03:03.309 --> 03:07.848
That TV reporter?
Yeah. He and Ambrose
were friends in high school,

03:07.938 --> 03:09.724
but they had a ﬁlling out.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.228
So you have a witness
that can putjack Garcia
at the scene ofthe crime?

03:15.696 --> 03:20.986
What’s the problem?
The witness has
a slight credibility issue.

03:21.077 --> 03:23.489
Who’s the witness?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.120
My mommy
left me outside.

03:30.211 --> 03:34.204
She went back in the house to look for Maggie
and Nana. That’s when I saw Mr. Garcia.

03:34.298 --> 03:38.462
Hey, A.j.?
Do you ever tell a lie?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.634
It’s all right, honey.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.347
That’s all right.
We all tell stories.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.551
But today, I need you to tell me the truth.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.558
[A]. i
/am telling the truth.
/ saw Mr. Garcia.

03:51.649 --> 03:54.061
He ran out ofthe cellar.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.188
You know the story ofthe little boy
who cried wolf?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.118
He said the wolfwas there
when it wasn’t,

04:03.202 --> 04:06.239
so no one helped him
when the wolf really came.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.117
That’s right.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.746
He told a lie,
and the wolf ate him.

04:12.837 --> 04:16.045
And ifyou don ’t tell the truth, the wolf’s
gonna come back and he ’s gonna eat you.

04:16.132 --> 04:19.044
- What is this? What—
- Did you see Mr. Garcia?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.428
I saw him running away.
I want you to tell me
the truth now.

04:21.554 --> 04:24.421
I am telling the truth.
The wolf’s gonna come back,
and he’s gonna eat you up.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.130
- You ’re scaring him
- I saw him.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.679
I need you
to tell me the truth.
He killed my nana.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.930
Okay, leave my son alone.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.012
Okay.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.483
You used to be so good
with children.

04:38.571 --> 04:41.187
Well, you don’t want
an innocent man going
to prison for 20 years.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.523
A]. was showing no signs ofdeception.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.573
So I raised the stakes a bit.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.198
- And he still wasn’t anxious.
- No. He seems to be telling
the truth, actually.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.656
Good. Let’s talk tojack Garcia.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.663
- My place or yours?
- Mine. I want Foster to evaluate A.j.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.416
Ah, yes. Gillian.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.542
- What was that?
- I didn’t say anything.

05:04.054 --> 05:08.218
What? Let’s talk to the accused,
and get you some medication.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.139
Thanks to my college buddy,
Army Lieutenant Kenneth,

05:13.230 --> 05:16.267
I know how hard it is for our wounded
veterans to return home.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.771
/ ’m jack Garcia,
and this is what /know.

05:19.862 --> 05:23.275
“This is what I know.”
That really put you on the map.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.276
Right?

05:25.367 --> 05:29.656
Uh, selling the misery ofyour old friends
is kind ofwhat you do.

05:29.747 --> 05:33.114
You’re saying I burned down
a man’s house so I could report on it?

05:33.209 --> 05:36.076
Well, aren’t you in the running
for some big new cable show?

05:36.170 --> 05:40.584
I mean, the story ofan old friend
losing everything could help you along nicely.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.383
You do not want
to be interrogated
by this man. Trust me.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.257
[Garcia Ind/stinct]

05:47.348 --> 05:50.260
It’s kind of fun when you’re
not on the other end though.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.592
[Garcia]
/ told you, we drifted apart.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.972
I have no problem
with Frank Ambrose.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.184
Never have.

05:58.275 --> 06:02.564
R/ght, so,
bad reporter, good liar.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.236
Not a great one.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.939
When he talks about Ambrose,
this is what we get.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.359
- Right.
- Contempt.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.613
Yeah, that’s right.
I’m familiar with that one.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.373
I think we should
probe the relationship
between Ambrose and Garcia.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.876
- See what we can come up with.
- Sounds like fun.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.083
- Cal?
- What?

06:25.177 --> 06:27.509
-Zoe.
- Gillian.

-Hmm.
-Hmm.

-She’s calling.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.642
Cal?

06:39.275 --> 06:42.142
No.
What “no”?

06:42.236 --> 06:45.319
You know what.
We— We have never
worked for her before.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.484
We are not starting now.
It’s an interesting case.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.488
No. There are plenty
of interesting cases.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.786
Do you not remember
what it was like
after she left?

06:53.872 --> 06:56.659
When you wore the same
shirt to the office
every day for a month.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.374
I still do.
You saw the head tilt.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.334
She’s flirting with you.
No. That’s ridiculous. She—

07:01.463 --> 07:03.249
She does this
to you every time.
No.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.964
She is single again, Cal.
No. No. She’s been
with Roger for— What?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.550
Forthe best part
ofa year now, right?
Well, is she still?

07:08.679 --> 07:11.091
Did you ask her?
I don’t know.
Look, I’m taking the case.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.046
I’ll be fine.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.139
Cal—
I’m in complete control
of myself.

07:15.227 --> 07:19.687
Which is more than I can say
for you following me
into the men’s room.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.765
The women’s room, Cal.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.851
Excuse me.
The women’s room.

07:32.661 --> 07:36.574
Why don ’t you tell us
what really happened
between you and Frank Ambrose?

07:36.665 --> 07:39.452
/ told you. Nothing happened
We haven ’t been friends in years.

07:39.543 --> 07:43.411
- Why not?
- You grow older. Things change.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.713
Now, /, um—

07:48.385 --> 07:51.673
- Now we have nothing in common.
- Why do you feel contempt
for him then?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.797
I never said that. I don’t.
You’re gonna have to learn
to lie better than that...

07:54.892 --> 07:57.099
ifyou want a real career
in front ofthe camera.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.353
[Clears Throat]
Look—

08:02.441 --> 08:04.352
Frank called me
about six months ago.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.399
He’djust been laid off.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.273
He seemed desperate,
so I asked him ifthere
was anything I could do.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.104
That’s one of my favorites,
that one.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.362
/ mean, it’s amazing how many
t/mes people say that and they
don ’t mean it. Right?

08:13.452 --> 08:18.242
Yeah, well, he asked me
formoney and / gave it
to him, okay?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.448
You lent a guy money
that you hadn’t
talked to in years?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.407
Yeah, we shared a past.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.414
That meant something to me.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.791
A pparent/y not to him.

08:26.882 --> 08:29.123
I called Frank a month ago.
See how he was doing.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.129
And that ungrateful
son ofa bitch...

08:31.220 --> 08:33.632
acted like
I was squeezing him
for the money he owed me.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.885
And now his boy
is accusing me of
burning down his house?

08:36.975 --> 08:39.057
You’re damn right
I feel contempt.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.935
He sounded con vmcmg.
Yeah, and looked it.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.066
You said that
about the Ambrose boy.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.569
I mean, they both
can’t be telling the truth.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.901
What, are you losing
yourtouch?

08:57.955 --> 08:59.491
I’ll evaluate the boy.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.539
He may not be able
to tell the difference
between fantasy and reality

09:02.626 --> 09:04.537
A.j. may be imagining
what he saw.

09:04.628 --> 09:08.086
Ifhe believes in his fantasy,
it could appear that he’s
telling the truth.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.754
I’m gonna work on something
a little bit more tangible.

09:09.842 --> 09:12.504
I’m gonna get
the F.B.|. to do checks
on Garcia and Ambrose.

09:12.594 --> 09:16.212
But feel free to talk to the boy.
Take him to the zoo ifyou like.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.673

- That’s Roger.
I should probably take this.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.222

between you two? Is it good?
Yeah.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.724

Well, you know,

09:32.489 --> 09:35.105
she’s been with Roger
for a long time, and if
there was something serious,

09:37.202 --> 09:39.238
You know, you can—
Hey, I found out

09:39.329 --> 09:41.536

Fantastic.

to get inside the world
of gangsta rappers?

09:54.553 --> 09:57.044
Sweet place.

For a guy who raps
about being true
to the hood,

09:59.183 --> 10:01.674

put his money where
his mouth is, huh?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.760

Yeah. Dante Edwards

10:12.571 --> 10:14.482
Three nights ago,
he was leaving a club...

10:14.573 --> 10:16.814
when he took two bullets
to the chest in a drive-by.

10:16.909 --> 10:19.116
You think Caden
shot him?

10:19.203 --> 10:21.615
Caden was seen
arguing with Dante
at a party last week.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.868
Dante is part of
Little Sid’s entourage.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.869
He’s a rival rapper.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.871
He and Caden
are in a big feud.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.918
Caden’s a bad man.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.088
He raps about how he’s killed
halfa dozen men.

10:33.175 --> 10:37.043

11:28.689 --> 11:30.600
Did you know Dante Edwards?

11:32.860 --> 11:35.476
Whoa.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.857
That’s a lot of regret for a killer.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.904
Look, I didn’t kill him.

11:39.992 --> 11:43.530
You got a lot of loyal folks
in your entourage. Maybe you
got one ofthem to do it.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.531
[Scoffs]

11:45.622 --> 11:47.533
Let me tell you something.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.036
Look, me and my cousin
grew up with Dante.

11:50.127 --> 11:53.210
He lived three
doors down from us
in the Carolburg projects.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.999
And you coming up in here—
Cay, Cay, Cay—

11:55.090 --> 11:57.081
No, no, no, no.
Let me explain something
why I’m upset right now.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.667
The world should know
this is unacceptable to me.
The world should know this, B.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.505
And you coming up in here
and accusing me of killing
somebody that I grew up with?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.386
Are we finished yet?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.182
I haven’t heard an alibi.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.727
My cousin and I were here,

12:11.815 --> 12:14.602
watching the Carver-Nova game.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.897
- Caden seemed to be
telling the truth.
- Yea h.

12:22.034 --> 12:25.652
And his sadness was for real.
You’re saying you believe
the guy?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.738
The rivalry with
titt/e 5rd’s crew,
the argumen t—

12:28.832 --> 12:30.743
Both point to Caden.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.167
Okay, but why would a killer
show remorse for his victim?

12:42.137 --> 12:45.345
[Gillian]
Okay. A.j., what
about this one?

12:45.432 --> 12:47.343
That’s Santa Claus.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.722
Yeah, it is.
Tell me about Santa.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.394
He has a sleigh and reindeer.
He brings me presents.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.972
Shh.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.649
Be quiet.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.191
Have you ever seen Santa?
No.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.400
/ always err asleep.
But / think / heard mm
on the roof once.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.577
Shh. I told you, quiet now.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.663
Who are you talking to?
That’s Penelope.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.913
Quiet.
I told you to be quiet.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.868
- [A]. I
You d/d that.
- Eh?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.620
You did that.
Penelope did that.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.502
You’re making that up.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.299
Now that’s not fair.
She thinks you’re cool.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.048
There’s no one there.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.754
She told me that
she thought that
you were super cool.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.719
You’re weird.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.681
Your imaginary friend Penelope?

13:37.818 --> 13:40.560
Yeah. It’s the only girl
I know tells me the truth.
Hey.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.316
What? Oh, sorry. So—

13:43.407 --> 13:48.026
It’s clear A]. can tell
the difference between
reality and fantasy, right?

13:48.120 --> 13:52.238
Yes, but that was your fantasy.
He’s a little fuzzier
when it comes to his own.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.323
He’s still at the age
where he thinks Santa’s real.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.706
So you think he imagined Garcia
running away from the fire?

13:57.796 --> 14:00.788
Yeah, I think so.
But I’ll still get him
to draw some more.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.793
It’s a more direct line
to his unconscious.

14:02.884 --> 14:06.422
- I’m not sure we’ll need it.
- We still have a receptionist
here, don’t we?

14:06.513 --> 14:09.846
/ack Garcia wasn ’t
the only person that
Fran/(Ambrose owed money to.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.762
The guy’s undera mountain of debt—
Credit cards, student loans,
you name it.

14:12.894 --> 14:16.227
Take a look at this.
Homeowner’s insurance.
Oh, yeah?

14:16.314 --> 14:18.100
Housing prices ha ve dropped
but his home...

14:18.191 --> 14:21.683
was insured at the value it had
before the market collapsed.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.235
His house was worth
more to him in ashes
than it was standing.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.401
[Frank]
You think I’d burn down
my own house?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.608
I lost everything in that fire.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.160
[Zoe]
You made a lot of money
when the house went do wn.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.112
[Frank]
That doesn ’t make me
an arson/st.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.949
[Indistinct]

14:37.044 --> 14:39.626
[Frank]
/ack Garcia is the one
who did this.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.830
He ’5 a user.
He lives oﬁ‘ the suffering
of e verybod y else.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.882
[Cal]
No w you truly believe that?

14:45.969 --> 14:48.460
[Frank]
God Myson sawhim.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.796
What is the matter
with you people?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.052
So how long
are you stuck here?

14:53.143 --> 14:55.054
My daughter
is in a hospital bed

14:55.145 --> 14:57.852
My doctor said I could go home
at the end ofthe week.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.100
was burned alive.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.649
[ Girl]
It’s not so bad

15:05.697 --> 15:08.860
It’s been kind of cool here.
Really?

15:08.950 --> 15:11.487
All my ﬁ/ends came by

15:11.578 --> 15:13.944
It’s nice having
my family around

15:14.081 --> 15:17.494
Um—
My dad hasn’t left.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.449
Oh, yeah?
What about your mom?

15:21.171 --> 15:23.127
Yeah.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.506
She’s been here too.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.797
[Zoe]
Do you believe Mr. Ambrose?

15:29.888 --> 15:32.846
Yeah. Most ofwhat he said,
but I’m interested in what
the daughter told you.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.219
Family would’ve been
through a lot, and the kid
would’ve seen the worst of it.

15:35.352 --> 15:39.095
What do you got?
A lot ofanger from Maggie—
towards Morn.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.474
Mom?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.982
- [Zoe]
What are you doing?
- Looking at Mom.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.158
[ Gillian ]
How d/d you know Mr. Garcia?

15:53.245 --> 15:56.658
[A]. l
He ’5 ﬁ/ends with my daddy

15:56.748 --> 15:59.205
Yeah. She ’s holding
her breath.

15:59.292 --> 16:03.251
- Anxiety.
- I think I know why
Maggie’s so angry.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.545
[Gillian]
That’s great, A].

16:05.632 --> 16:08.795
Okay, now can you draw
forme what you saw
the night of the ﬁre?

16:08.927 --> 16:11.634
I’m not done.
That’s all right.
I don’t need to talk to A.j.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.633
Uh, what was your
relationship with the man
that your son’s accused?

16:14.724 --> 16:18.216
- Excuse me?
- Were you having an affair
withjack Garcia?

16:25.193 --> 16:28.435
How dare you accuse me
of ha ving an affair
in front of m y son.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.691
Yeah, you’re avoiding
the question.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.319
Are you having an affair
withjack Garcia?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.578
I’m getting my son,
and I’m going.
[Zoe] That’s fine.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.527
But we’ll be back with a subpoena.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.535
/suppose we could always talk
to your husband and ﬁnd out
what he knows about it.

16:47.591 --> 16:51.880
Nine months ago I was
out shopping andJack
walked up to me in the store.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.961
He had so much confidence.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.182
Frank had lost his job.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.177
We were really strugg/rng.

16:58.268 --> 17:02.511
- We had stopped having sex
altogether by then.
- So you had an affair.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.517
Every minute withjack
was a chance...

17:04.608 --> 17:07.896
to be with somebody
who didn’t know me
or my problems.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.897
Ithoughtabout
leaving my husband,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.570
but the children and/
are all that he has left.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.909
And so / broke it off
with jack.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.949
How’d he take it?

17:17.996 --> 17:21.705
He understood.
[Sniffles, Exhales]

17:21.791 --> 17:24.533
Look, this has nothing
to do with the fire.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.960
It’s easier to believe that,
isn’t it?

17:27.047 --> 17:29.288
I don’t know what A]. saw,
but I knowjack Garcia,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.418
and he would never
do something like this to us.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.634
Come on, baby.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.981
Because ofour daughter.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.814
And sex was never
the problem.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.698
Well, you wanted to know
why I never cheated on you.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.076
What about you?

18:07.170 --> 18:09.502
You would’ve known.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.830
Oh.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.169
Besides, I wanted to kill you.
I never wanted to hurt you.

18:29.109 --> 18:32.567
I think that’s what
we should focus on here.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.986
Affairs make for
angry spouses, right?

18:37.450 --> 18:41.113
What could possibly make me
want to burn down
the Ambroses ’ house?

18:41.204 --> 18:44.617
Your husband was
having an affair
with Cheryl Ambrose.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.199
Oh, she knew already.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.501
He told me two weeks ago.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.498
[Zoe]
/f you ’d already told your wife,
why didn ’t you tell us?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.796
- I wanted to—
- I told him not to.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.875
It’s not something
/ wanted to see in the papers.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.177
Look, the idea that my wife
would do this is absurd.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.759
[Cal]
/s it?

19:03.101 --> 19:05.387
She’s still angry.

19:07.397 --> 19:10.230
Not at Cheryl Ambrose.

19:10.317 --> 19:15.027
/-/ knew when jack started
in front of the camera,
it would be different.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.980
Thejack Garcia you see on TV
is not the man I married.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.565
But marriage is about...

19:20.660 --> 19:23.527
figuring out how
to make it through
when things change.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.342
She was lying to herself.
So that’s it?

19:36.426 --> 19:38.758
That’s it then?
Peoplejust change,
and then they move on?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.924
Are you saying that
I’m the one that changed?

19:46.978 --> 19:50.266
You left me. You left.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.099
- Yeah, I left because ofyou.
- Oh, it’s my fault now?

19:53.193 --> 19:56.560
No. I’m saying you should take
a hard look at what happened
before you start blaming me.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.238
Hey, I saw what happened.
I saw what was happening.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.236
You know, I could see the doubt.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.069
I could see the doubt
when you were standing
on the bloody altar.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.575
Everyone has doubts, Cal.
Everyone.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.532
A t the altar;
with their friends,
in the maternity ward..

20:10.627 --> 20:12.868
staring at the very best thing
that’s ever happened to them.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.795
But that doesn’t mean it’s
the only thing that they feel.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.623
You know, you just—

20:18.718 --> 20:20.925
You saw every doubt, every fear.

20:21.012 --> 20:24.425
By the end,
that was all you could see.
You couldn’t let go ofanything.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.469
I was trying to be honest.
Yes. I know.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.642
I know, but I can
tell you, sweetheart,

20:29.729 --> 20:32.471
there really is such a thing
as too much honesty
in a marriage.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.022
What, you, uh— You’d rather
be with someone that doesn’t
really know you then?

20:35.110 --> 20:38.318
How about someone
who doesn’t need to know
everything about me?

20:39.864 --> 20:42.571
Who I can surprise
on his birthday.

20:42.659 --> 20:46.698
Who doesn’t need to point out
every time I’m even remotely
attracted to another man.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.074
Someone with his head
up his ass.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.453
Someone who doesn’t
study my eyebrows
when I’m standing in a thong.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.335
Why are you here, really?

21:03.430 --> 21:06.217
What—
Why’d you hire me?

21:06.349 --> 21:08.931
Eh?
It’s a tough case.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.974
[Scoffs]

21:25.326 --> 21:28.159
[Caden]
Doing my thing right now.
We living it up, baby.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.407
That’s how we do,
you know?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.030
[Ria ]
That C aden?
Yeah.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.788
And Little Sid and his crew
at an album release party
last year.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.712
The victim, Dante Edwards,
is behind him on the right.

21:38.798 --> 21:43.883
Come up to me like,
“Little Sid, please take me
away from this paper rapper.”

21:43.970 --> 21:47.462
How about I put a gun
to your face right now?
What’s up?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.138
Check out the fake anger.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.388
Ifthat anger were real,
his upper eyelids
would be raised,

21:52.520 --> 21:56.058
and his l/ps
would be narrower.
The rivalry’s fake?

21:56.149 --> 21:58.936
That feud is big business.
Sold a lot ofalbums
last year.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.939
So then why would Caden
or anyone else in his crew
want to kill Dante?

22:02.030 --> 22:05.238
I’m thinking
that the murderer
is not in Caden’s crew.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.067
Okay.
[ Beepin g ]

22:08.161 --> 22:09.992
[Sound Garbled]

22:10.079 --> 22:12.570
Let’s take a look
at our victim.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.833
Which group does Dante
look like? The men on the left
or the men on the right?

22:17.921 --> 22:21.163
Um, the men on the left?

22:21.257 --> 22:23.168
Oh, you have a sixth sense.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.466
By that, I mean
you see gay people.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.885
- What, you think Dante’s gay?
- Yeah, and so do you.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.554
All the men
on the left are gay.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.928
A newstudy in The journal
of Experimental Psychology
showed..

22:33.019 --> 22:36.261
that most people
can identify gay men
by face alone.

22:36.356 --> 22:39.769
/t has to do with the pattern
of muscle tension in the lace.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.770

22:41.861 --> 22:44.318

Oh.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.746
Little Sid
is one big homophobe.

22:55.833 --> 22:59.451
If he found out one
of his entourage was gay,

22:59.546 --> 23:01.753
no telling
what he would’ve done.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.966
We’re looking
at the wrong rapper.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.683
More drawings?
Yeah.

23:19.941 --> 23:23.274
- So what do they mean?
- Uh, well, here
the arsonist has a tail,

23:23.361 --> 23:25.272
and there, he’s, uh—
he ’s breathing ﬁre.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.651
- So they’re becoming more—
- It’s getting more elaborate.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.988
Exactly.
If it were a true memory,

23:33.079 --> 23:34.990
he’d stick to
what he remembers,

his story.

Jack Garcia or he didn’t?
Which one is it?

23:43.965 --> 23:45.921

in Santa Claus.

We need to go talk
to A.j.’s parents again.

their son to frame that man.

-Maybe you didn’t leave
Jack Garcia. Maybe he left you.
-What?

You hated mm for taking away
what little joy you had
didn ’t you?

You hated him,

so you set fire to your house.

And you told your son
to say it wasJack.

my own house?

on the house, and get back
at the man who stole your wife.

in your marriage.

That’s a shame,

make the case against Frank.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.128
What?
He had the motive,

25:08.216 --> 25:11.174
the means, and plenty
ofopportunity to implant
the memory in his son.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.637

He had no idea.

it was because we knew

in that house.
- You couldn’t sell it?

The value ofthe house had tanked.
We couldn’t afford to sell it.

payout, we can both go
our separate ways.

it’s about revenge.
