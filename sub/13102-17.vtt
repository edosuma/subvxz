Personal Journal,
Captain Elizabeth Lochley

00:37.458 --> 00:39.708
addendum.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.833
The Centauri War continues
to spiral out of control.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.750
The threat of retaliation
has already reached Babylon 5.

00:47.833 --> 00:49.833
Over half dozen Centauri
have been murdered

00:49.917 --> 00:51.417
in just the last three days.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.708
Get 50 CCs of hydromorphazine.
Medlab two. Let's move. Go. Go.

00:54.792 --> 00:56.667
- Franklin. Go.
- 'Got another one in Red 4.'

00:56.750 --> 00:58.875
Yeah, I'm right there.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.500
(Elizabeth)
In an attempt to reduce
the number of casualties

01:01.583 --> 01:04.208
I've doubled security
on every level.

01:04.292 --> 01:06.125
Uh, excuse me. Pardon me.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.833
(Elizabeth)
It hasn't helped.

01:11.917 --> 01:13.167
Alright.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.292
Send him to Medlab two, alright?

01:14.375 --> 01:15.625
Everybody, clear on out.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.500
Move on out of the way.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.167
If this continues,
we may have no choice

01:20.250 --> 01:23.292
but to quarantine the Centauri.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.833
We'll have to try and limit them
to parts of the station

01:25.917 --> 01:30.250
where they won't run into anyone
they're currently at war with.

01:30.333 --> 01:34.667
Unfortunately, that seems to be
just about everyone right now.

01:34.750 --> 01:38.792
So my options
seem to be somewhat limited.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.833
[door beeps]

01:40.917 --> 01:42.167
Yes?

01:44.250 --> 01:45.917
Mr. President.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.958
You're up late.
It's almost 2:00 in the morning.

01:51.042 --> 01:52.542
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:54.458 --> 01:56.958
I, uh, was just on my way
to my quarters

01:57.042 --> 01:59.208
figured I'd stop by
and bring you up to speed

01:59.292 --> 02:01.458
on the latest
from Mr. Garibaldi.

02:01.542 --> 02:02.542
We've had reports

02:02.625 --> 02:04.083
unconfirmed but reliable

02:04.167 --> 02:07.708
that the Centauri have begun
targeting enemy jumpgates.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.208
But..

02:09.292 --> 02:11.125
...that's a violation
of-of every rule

02:11.208 --> 02:13.375
of civilized warfare.

02:13.458 --> 02:16.333
Wars come and go,
but the jumpgates have to go on.

02:16.417 --> 02:19.250
Otherwise, the entire hyperspace
beacon system falls apart.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.667
If that happens..

02:20.750 --> 02:22.375
...it'll hurt them
as much as anyone else.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.708
I know. I know.
But they're doing it anyway.

02:24.792 --> 02:27.792
They're completely
out of control, which means..

02:27.875 --> 02:30.250
...they might even be willing
to strike here.

02:30.333 --> 02:33.042
I've considered
that possibility.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.583
We're on level two alert.

02:34.667 --> 02:37.292
Uh, the defense grid
is online 24 hours a day

02:37.375 --> 02:40.000
and I've stationed half our
fighters outside the station.

02:40.083 --> 02:42.708
The other half
are standing by in hyperspace.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.708
I don't think we're gonna have
to worry about it

02:44.792 --> 02:46.208
for a while, though.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.917
Even the Centauri
have to realize

02:48.000 --> 02:52.250
that Babylon 5 is-is vital
to the peace process.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.750
No, I don't think
they're gonna come after us

02:53.833 --> 02:55.750
until the White Star fleet
gets into it.

02:55.833 --> 02:57.750
Exactly.

03:00.458 --> 03:03.042
I gave the formal go order..

03:03.125 --> 03:04.792
...a few hours ago.

03:06.833 --> 03:10.417
The White Stars are authorized
to fire on any Centauri warship

03:10.500 --> 03:12.833
engaged in combat
with Alliance vessels.

03:12.917 --> 03:17.542
Any hope of neutrality
Babylon 5 had until now..

03:17.625 --> 03:20.250
...just went up in smoke.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.958
[intense music]

03:23.042 --> 03:24.542

03:27.042 --> 03:28.292
Lochley to C and C.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.958
(man on speaker)
'C and C on line.'

03:31.042 --> 03:32.542
We've got a problem.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.958
[intense music]

03:39.625 --> 03:41.083
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.292
(male #1)
There is a hole in your mind.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.292
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly

03:45.375 --> 03:46.458
what he appears.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.917
Nothing's the same anymore.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.042
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.958
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld..

03:52.042 --> 03:54.333
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of a star.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.000
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

03:56.083 --> 03:57.125
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

03:57.208 --> 03:58.500
a decree today declaring..

03:58.583 --> 03:59.792
(John)
These orders have forced us

03:59.875 --> 04:01.375
to declare independence.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.000
Saw people get off their
encounter suited

04:03.083 --> 04:04.333
butts and do something.

04:04.417 --> 04:05.792
(Zathras)
You're the one, who was.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.458
(Kosh)
To Z'ha'dum you will die.

04:08.542 --> 04:09.958
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:10.042 --> 04:12.250
Do you have anything
worth living for?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.417
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.500
(John)
Giants in the playground. Now,
get the hell out of our galaxy!

04:16.583 --> 04:19.292
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

04:21.208 --> 04:23.000
[theme music]

04:47.042 --> 04:48.833
[music continues]

05:07.792 --> 05:09.833
[instrumental music]

05:15.000 --> 05:17.208
Something's bothering you.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.667
What is it?

05:19.750 --> 05:21.000
I need to ask you
to do something

05:21.083 --> 05:23.208
I don't wanna ask you to do.

05:23.292 --> 05:24.583
Well, um..

05:24.667 --> 05:26.875
...if it's about my wearing
those little..

05:26.958 --> 05:28.667
- No.
- I appreciate the gift.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.333
And I didn't say
I wouldn't wear them

05:30.417 --> 05:32.333
I just said that..

05:32.417 --> 05:35.458
...for me,
from a Minbari perspective

05:35.542 --> 05:37.167
I thought it looked silly.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.250
No.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.875
I mean, it-it's,
it doesn't have anything

05:39.958 --> 05:41.458
to do with that.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.667
Business, then.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.083
Since we got into this war

05:48.167 --> 05:50.750
I've been going over the files
of our resources.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.333
Ships.

05:52.417 --> 05:55.000
We lost a lot of White Star
ships during the Shadow War

05:55.083 --> 05:57.583
the battle for earth
...and we're bound to lose more

05:57.667 --> 06:00.000
now that we're into this thing
with the Centauri.

06:00.083 --> 06:03.250
Sooner or later,
we are going to run out.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.750
I know.

06:04.833 --> 06:07.250
The problem is we've been using
them against everything

06:07.333 --> 06:10.750
from medium-size cruisers
to full-blown destroyers.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.375
[sighs]
So far they've been able
to hold their own

06:13.458 --> 06:15.792
against ships five,
six times their size

06:15.875 --> 06:18.958
and that's commendable, but
...we can't keep doing that.

06:19.042 --> 06:22.292
Exactly. We are going to need
more ships, Delenn.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.917
- Bigger ships.
- That may be a problem.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.542
The Grey Council approved
construction

06:27.625 --> 06:30.458
on the White Star fleet
for use during the Shadow War.

06:30.542 --> 06:33.458
We were fortunate
to inherit them afterward.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.167
But the resources in going back

06:35.250 --> 06:37.292
and building a whole
new class of ship..

06:37.375 --> 06:39.083
Can be spread around a little.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.708
I just had a courier deliver
a message to President Luchenko

06:43.792 --> 06:47.458
suggesting...a joint
Earth-Minbari project.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.458
Now, we'll start
with one or two prototypes.

06:50.542 --> 06:53.500
You'll provide the design specs
and the material

06:53.583 --> 06:55.875
for a destroyer-class
White Star.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.500
Earth handles the, the finances
and the construction.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.042
And her government benefits

07:02.125 --> 07:04.417
from the new
technologies involved.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.667
- Very tidy.
- Mm-hmm.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.875
I assume she said yes.

07:07.958 --> 07:11.750
Well, she said
she'd say yes if..

07:11.833 --> 07:13.333
...the Minbari said yes first.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.042
She's not going to stick
her neck out

07:15.125 --> 07:16.417
if it's not going to happen.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.042
So you would like me to contact

07:18.125 --> 07:20.083
the Grey Council
and propose this.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.625
Yeah.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.750
Done.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.333
Why were you so reluctant?

07:27.250 --> 07:30.625
I need you to go there
in person, Delenn.

07:30.708 --> 07:32.167
This has to be done in secret

07:32.250 --> 07:35.375
until the first prototype
rolls off the assembly line.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.833
But...the hyperspace routes

07:38.917 --> 07:41.958
from here to Minbar
are not safe.

07:42.042 --> 07:44.208
We've got Centauri
all over the map

07:44.292 --> 07:46.708
we've got firefights
every inch of the way.

07:48.292 --> 07:51.625
- If you run into trouble..
- I'll walk out of it.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.208
More dignified that way.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.250
You don't have to do this.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.667
I know.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.542
I'll arrange to leave
at the first opportunity.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.958
Alright.

08:04.042 --> 08:06.292
But don't take
any unnecessary risks.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.250
People always say that.

08:09.333 --> 08:13.000
They want to find lives
in which risk is unnecessary.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.625
There's only one problem
with that.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.750
- Mm?
- It's impossible.

08:19.292 --> 08:21.375
[instrumental music]

08:34.375 --> 08:35.500
[beeping]

08:36.625 --> 08:38.083
Sheridan. Go.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.458
(man over speaker)
'Mr. President,
we've got more reports'

08:39.542 --> 08:41.125
'from the front line coming in.'

08:41.208 --> 08:43.500
Alright. My office, 20 minutes.

08:49.208 --> 08:50.750
Oh. Yes.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.333
Vir, you wanted to see us?

08:55.417 --> 08:58.583
Yes, yes, thank you
for coming. Please, sit.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.708
I'm sorry
about the accommodations.

09:03.792 --> 09:05.458
Uh, the captain
had me moved here

09:05.542 --> 09:07.458
because my other quarters
weren't safe.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.292
Too many people knew
where they were.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.667
That's fine, Vir.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.000
So, what's up?

09:12.083 --> 09:15.458
Uh-uh, I have a favor
to ask both of you.

09:15.542 --> 09:20.333
As you know, our ships
have been in combat with..

09:20.417 --> 09:23.458
...well, just about everyone,
really.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.958
Our biggest losses
have been in the Drazi space.

09:26.042 --> 09:28.458
They are real good fighters.

09:28.542 --> 09:30.083
Not terrific conversationalists

09:30.167 --> 09:33.167
and their table manners
can make you go blind in one eye

09:33.250 --> 09:37.292
but, uh, it's-it's really tough
behind the weapons consoles.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.583
But...on the occasion that we've
destroyed one of their ships

09:41.667 --> 09:44.208
we've always returned
their bodies to them.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.667
They have not done the same
for us in return.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.083
Well, the exchange of bodies
during hostilities

09:49.167 --> 09:51.792
is a key point to
the declaration of principles.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.042
Now, the Drazi signed on,
same as everyone else.

09:54.125 --> 09:57.000
I know. But they're still
not returning the bodies.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.583
Well, that's unfortunate, Vir,
and I feel for you

10:00.667 --> 10:02.542
but what are we supposed
to do about it?

10:02.625 --> 10:04.583
Well...it's the way

10:04.667 --> 10:07.500
that they're refusing
to return the bodies

10:07.583 --> 10:10.000
that-that makes me think
there's something else going on

10:10.083 --> 10:11.500
behind the scenes.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.917
'You, as the chief medical
officer of the Alliance'

10:14.000 --> 10:17.542
'you could put pressure on them
into returning the bodies.'

10:17.625 --> 10:20.667
'And a telepath, a good one,
could find out'

10:20.750 --> 10:23.292
what they're hiding
and where and why.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.792
Vir, this isn't exactly
my area of expertise.

10:26.875 --> 10:27.875
Now, Mr. Garibaldi--

10:27.958 --> 10:30.875
Would not know what to look for.

10:30.958 --> 10:33.167
I mean, what if they're not
releasing the bodies

10:33.250 --> 10:36.042
because our people
are still alive

10:36.125 --> 10:38.167
and they're just torturing them
for information?

10:38.250 --> 10:40.833
I mean, you could find out
who died in space

10:40.917 --> 10:42.625
and who died elsewhere.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.708
You know, this means
going to the Drazi Homeworld.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.625
Look, I have a Vree transport
standing by.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.792
A-and since they're declared
neutral in the war

10:51.875 --> 10:54.750
they would have no problem
landing on Drazi Homeworld.

10:56.417 --> 10:58.792
You're the only one
who could do this.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.417
Please say yes.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.875
[sighs]

11:05.958 --> 11:07.500
I'll have to clear it
with the President.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.875
I'll abide by his decision.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.292
Thank you. Thank you both.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.042
I haven't said yes, Vir.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.625
Ah.. Oh, I'm sorry.

11:16.708 --> 11:19.083
I, uh, I assumed that you were--

11:19.167 --> 11:20.750
(Lyta)
Don't.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.667
I'm willing to go along
and help out Stephen.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.292
We've worked well together
in the past, but..

11:26.667 --> 11:28.708
...considering the risk involved
I'm going to have to ask

11:28.792 --> 11:30.750
for a slightly higher fee
than usual.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.625
Well..

11:34.708 --> 11:35.917
Alright. I can, uh--

11:36.000 --> 11:37.917
Five hundred thousand credits.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.583
[chuckles]

11:39.667 --> 11:41.542
That's a lot of money, Lyta.

11:41.625 --> 11:42.875
Depending on how the work goes

11:42.958 --> 11:45.500
that could be as cheap
as one credit per body.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.875
Uh, I-I could do four, but--

11:47.958 --> 11:49.875
It's five, or I stay home.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.917
This is the uplink address
for the account.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.125
The money
goes into a general fund

11:57.208 --> 11:59.958
to be used in helping other
telepaths escape the Psi Corps

12:00.042 --> 12:02.792
and eventually secure
a Homeworld of our own.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.792
Consider this a charitable
donation.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.708
Hell, it might
even be deductible.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.833
I'll be in my quarters
when you've made up your mind.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.958
Good day.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.542
[chuckles]

12:18.708 --> 12:20.083
Has she changed,
or is it me?

12:20.167 --> 12:21.708
Oh, she's changed.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.708
Have you, uh, talked
to Londo about this?

12:24.792 --> 12:28.000
Maybe he could, uh,
pull some strings.

12:28.083 --> 12:33.667
Uh, the prime minister
is otherwise engaged just now.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.917
[instrumental music]

12:38.250 --> 12:41.000
I still think you
should leave, Mollari.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.917
No. I said
where you go, I go.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.917
It's become a matter
of principle.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.625
You picked a terrible moment
in your social evolution

12:48.708 --> 12:50.708
to develop principles.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.000
Perhaps you could start
with something simpler

12:53.083 --> 12:55.333
the moral equivalent
of an opposable thumb

12:55.417 --> 12:56.833
'for instance.'

12:56.917 --> 12:59.583
Mollari, your people are at war.

12:59.667 --> 13:00.750
I know.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.667
And while it pains me
to be in here

13:02.750 --> 13:04.875
I think that I may do more good

13:04.958 --> 13:07.375
in here than out there.

13:07.458 --> 13:11.750
G'Kar, the regent
either ordered the war directly

13:11.833 --> 13:14.042
or allowed others
to act on his behalf.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.042
Either way, the only way
to stop this war

13:17.125 --> 13:19.208
is to go up against
the regent himself.

13:19.292 --> 13:22.708
In order to do that
without being executed

13:22.792 --> 13:24.792
I have to have supporters.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.958
Now, when the word gets out

13:27.042 --> 13:30.000
that the prime minister
is being held without charge

13:30.083 --> 13:33.875
in a cell in the royal palace
the people will be outraged.

13:33.958 --> 13:36.208
Even the Centaurum
will have to respond.

13:36.292 --> 13:39.625
Demonstrating that the regent
is not acting responsibly

13:39.708 --> 13:41.917
is the first step
in countermanding

13:42.000 --> 13:44.042
his orders to our ships.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.708
The Centaurum may even issue
a cease-fire

13:46.792 --> 13:48.417
over his objections.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.542
I see, and how long
do you plan to wait

13:50.625 --> 13:53.542
for this popular uprising
to take place?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.042
Just until morning.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.750
That will make three days.
More than enough.

13:57.833 --> 14:01.667
Now, please...leave me alone.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.250
I am tired.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.917
And I need to get some..

14:06.000 --> 14:08.125
[high-pitched electronic noise]

14:09.833 --> 14:12.375
[intense music]

14:30.625 --> 14:31.833
[indistinct chatter]

14:31.917 --> 14:34.958
[intense music]

14:40.292 --> 14:42.125
[indistinct chatter]

14:50.917 --> 14:52.625
[electronic beeping]

15:03.583 --> 15:05.208
[intense music]

15:05.292 --> 15:07.208
Adira..

15:14.375 --> 15:17.417
[intense music]

15:39.917 --> 15:42.458
[whirring]

15:57.083 --> 16:00.000
[music continues]

16:07.792 --> 16:09.917
Who-who are you?

16:11.292 --> 16:13.500
What do you want with me?

16:19.833 --> 16:21.708
Yes.

16:21.792 --> 16:24.542
He will be sufficient.

16:26.042 --> 16:28.208
[whirring]

16:30.958 --> 16:33.333
[music continues]

16:43.125 --> 16:45.042
Oh!

16:45.125 --> 16:47.750
You were having
a nightmare.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.750
Yes.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.458
Terrible.

16:54.792 --> 16:56.042
What-what time is it?

16:56.125 --> 16:58.792
Morning. I woke up
when I thought I heard

16:58.875 --> 17:00.375
the expected angry mob

17:00.458 --> 17:02.917
coming to storm the palace
on your behalf

17:03.000 --> 17:04.625
But it was just you.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.208
Did you know
that you snore?

17:06.292 --> 17:07.917
I have to
get out of here.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.917
Yes, that's what I've been
saying for some time now.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.917
No, I have to get
out of here now.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.083
I have this feeling..

17:14.167 --> 17:17.083
...something is...terribly
wrong.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.375
You're at war with
everyone in the known universe.

17:19.458 --> 17:20.583
Perhaps you were
thinking of that.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.208
No, more than that.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.792
I have to get out.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.500
But I have to be
sure I save face.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.208
I said I would stay with you
until they released you.

17:31.625 --> 17:33.958
So...how can I?

17:34.042 --> 17:36.083
Leave it to me.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.125
[gurgles]

17:41.708 --> 17:42.792
What are you doing?

17:42.875 --> 17:45.625
Shh! I have
to concentrate.

17:45.708 --> 17:47.458
Concentrate on what?

17:47.542 --> 17:49.333
Last night's supper.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.125
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait

17:52.208 --> 17:54.458
there has to be
another way! Wait!

17:55.625 --> 17:56.625
Thank you!

17:56.708 --> 17:57.750
[coughing]

17:57.833 --> 18:00.375
Who knew they
could make such a..

18:00.458 --> 18:03.125
...stench as that!

18:03.208 --> 18:04.792
I don't even want
to think about it!

18:04.875 --> 18:07.042
I couldn't stay in there
a moment longer!

18:07.125 --> 18:09.000
And the smell was
not the worst of it.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.667
It was the burning
in my eyes!

18:11.750 --> 18:14.167
I think my buttons
are melting!

18:14.250 --> 18:16.000
[coughing]

18:22.667 --> 18:24.083
Mr. President.

18:24.167 --> 18:27.333
As you requested, generals
Na'Tok, Daro, and Kulomani.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.708
Thank you for coming,
gentlemen.

18:28.792 --> 18:31.792
I believe you all
know Captain Lochley.

18:31.875 --> 18:35.625
Since time is precious to us
all, I won't keep you.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.292
I just wanted to get
a personal report

18:37.375 --> 18:39.458
on the progress of
the Centauri conflict.

18:39.542 --> 18:42.125
With the help of
the White Star fleet

18:42.208 --> 18:44.792
we are holding our own,
Mr. President.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.708
Several incursions
on Brakiri space

18:47.792 --> 18:51.500
have been beaten back
in just the last 24 hours.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.375
The Narn Homeworld
and territories

18:53.458 --> 18:55.583
have experienced
similar attacks.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.042
With the depletion
of our forces

18:57.125 --> 19:00.250
after our last experience
with the Centauri

19:00.333 --> 19:02.625
we would've suffered even
greater casualties

19:02.708 --> 19:05.625
without the assistance
of the White Star fleet.

19:05.708 --> 19:08.083
Am I correct in that
each of your governments

19:08.167 --> 19:11.250
is primarily engaged
in defending your own borders?

19:11.333 --> 19:13.458
Yes.

19:13.542 --> 19:16.167
Why haven't you
consolidated your forces?

19:16.250 --> 19:18.708
I mean, the Drazi have endured
fewer losses in recent months.

19:18.792 --> 19:21.375
You could send some ships
to the Narn sector of space

19:21.458 --> 19:22.542
'and the Brakiri--'

19:22.625 --> 19:25.917
Brakiri will not
take orders from Drazi.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.333
And the Drazi, I'm sorry to say,
will not take orders from us.

19:30.417 --> 19:33.500
We can win this war
on our own.

19:33.583 --> 19:37.042
We do not need
their...guidance.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.250
We have experience
with the Centauri

19:39.333 --> 19:40.750
that might prove useful.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.083
We know all
we need to know.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.000
I thought this was supposed
to be an Alliance

19:46.083 --> 19:48.458
all of you working together
in common cause.

19:48.542 --> 19:52.792
We are, in our own
individual and sovereign ways.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.708
We can settle this
later, captain.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.500
At the moment..

19:57.583 --> 19:59.167
...what I am trying to get
from all of you

19:59.250 --> 20:01.417
is a sense of their strategy.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.583
We've, uh,
detected two different

20:06.667 --> 20:08.083
parts of their program.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.333
One part of the fleet is
designed to protect their bases

20:10.417 --> 20:12.167
from attack, while the other
wing engages

20:12.250 --> 20:14.750
primarily in offensive maneuvers
against everyone else.

20:14.833 --> 20:17.125
Has there been any exchange
between the two sides?

20:17.208 --> 20:18.542
Little or none.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.042
It's like having a defensive
and offensive

20:20.125 --> 20:21.500
special team in football.

20:21.583 --> 20:24.583
Is this typical of their
strategy, General Na'Tok?

20:24.667 --> 20:26.000
No.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.625
Perhaps they have changed.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.167
Yeah, maybe.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.917
It's strange, though.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.583
Anyway, those are their tactics.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.833
What is the overall strategy?

20:34.917 --> 20:36.500
You can't just fight
a war to fight a war

20:36.583 --> 20:38.125
and honk off
your neighbors.

20:38.208 --> 20:41.542
There have to be definitive and
to their minds achievable goals.

20:41.625 --> 20:43.250
Now, what are they?

20:43.333 --> 20:45.292
What does it look
like they might be?

20:45.375 --> 20:47.208
Are they moving
toward anything?

20:47.292 --> 20:51.125
Their strategy has not yet
become clear.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.167
And this doesn't
seem strange to you?

20:53.250 --> 20:54.333
[beeping]

20:54.417 --> 20:56.000
Lochley. Go.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.333
(Corwin)
'We've got a situation
developing up here, captain.'

20:58.417 --> 20:59.958
On my way.

21:00.042 --> 21:01.917
If you'll excuse me.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.167
(General Na'Tok)
'What does seem
strange to me'

21:06.250 --> 21:10.167
is that we are reacting
and not acting.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.625
We have the resources to be
more aggressive

21:12.708 --> 21:15.708
to strike at their holdings
in a more meaningful way.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.667
Why are we
not doing so?

21:18.750 --> 21:21.875
Our first goal should be
to draw a line in space

21:21.958 --> 21:23.833
contain their forces
and then--

21:23.917 --> 21:25.958
We will win the war
more quickly

21:26.042 --> 21:28.375
by attacking
the Centauri Homeworld

21:28.458 --> 21:29.667
as they have
attacked ours!

21:29.750 --> 21:31.667
No! I won't sanction that.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.125
Military targets
are one thing

21:33.208 --> 21:34.917
but if you hit
Centauri Prime

21:35.000 --> 21:36.458
you are hitting
civilian targets!

21:36.542 --> 21:39.250
They have not
hesitated to kill

21:39.333 --> 21:40.875
civilians!'

21:40.958 --> 21:43.375
Now, I know that,
but you can't--

21:43.458 --> 21:47.000
Mr. President,
we must have our revenge.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.375
This isn't about
revenge, general.

21:49.458 --> 21:52.458
This is about taking out
their ability to make war.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.583
We strike cleanly,
surgically

21:56.667 --> 21:59.042
and we do not hit
civilian targets.

21:59.125 --> 22:02.583
Do I make myself
absolutely crystal clear?

22:08.125 --> 22:09.625
[indistinct chatter]

22:12.625 --> 22:14.250
Okay, what do we got?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.417
One of the long-range
hyperspace probes picked this up

22:16.500 --> 22:17.917
'a few minutes ago.'

22:18.000 --> 22:20.250
'It's definitely
a Centauri cruiser.'

22:20.333 --> 22:23.083
- Shall I go to red alert?
- Mmm, not yet.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.417
If they have people
on the station

22:24.500 --> 22:25.833
they'll know we've seen them.

22:25.917 --> 22:27.375
Any sign of support vessels?

22:27.458 --> 22:29.542
Negative.
Just one cruiser.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.083
That doesn't make sense.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.667
A war cruiser that size,
it'd never go out alone.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.083
Is Alpha Squadron
still out there?

22:35.167 --> 22:36.542
Standing by.

22:36.625 --> 22:39.542
Getting some additional
readings from the probe.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.750
Weapons systems currently
not active.

22:41.833 --> 22:43.417
Well, that's encouraging.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.042
Getting some unusual readings
from the jump engines.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.417
Could be an error
in the scanners.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.167
Life signs read..

22:50.250 --> 22:52.833
Captain, life signs
read negative.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.417
There's no one
aboard that cruiser.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.167
She's on auto control.

22:58.042 --> 23:00.083
Captain Lochley
to Alpha Squadron.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.458
Break and attack!
I repeat, break and attack!

23:02.542 --> 23:04.417
(male #2)
'Roger that.
Alpha Squadron heading in.'

23:04.500 --> 23:06.208
She's going to blow
the jumpgate.

23:06.292 --> 23:08.833
[intense music]

23:12.458 --> 23:15.208
Jump engines at critical mass.
Approaching overload.

23:15.292 --> 23:17.125
She'll probably open a jump
point in the middle of the gate

23:17.208 --> 23:19.000
come through, and blow
the whole thing sky high!

23:19.083 --> 23:20.958
Thirty seconds to jump.

23:21.042 --> 23:22.667
Move the struts as far
apart as we can.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.333
If we minimize the damage
when it explodes--

23:24.417 --> 23:25.875
Ten seconds!

23:25.958 --> 23:27.958
[intense music]

23:30.792 --> 23:33.000
[gunfire]

23:40.083 --> 23:43.083
Alpha squadron, I want
that ship out of my sky!

23:44.500 --> 23:46.042
[explosion]

23:49.458 --> 23:51.625
[explosion]

23:56.750 --> 23:58.542
Damage report.
How bad was the gate hit?

23:58.625 --> 24:01.333
Most of the energy was deflected
forward by the jump point

24:01.417 --> 24:03.208
instead of spreading
out to the sides.

24:03.292 --> 24:04.875
Minimal damage
to jumpgate struts

24:04.958 --> 24:06.333
and control mechanisms.

24:06.417 --> 24:07.792
Structural integrity?

24:07.875 --> 24:09.500
It's holding together.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.042
Get a repair crew
out there ASAP.

24:11.125 --> 24:13.375
All traffic will stand by
during repairs.

24:14.458 --> 24:15.917
That was too damn close.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.708
If they had gotten
all the way into the jumpgate..

24:18.792 --> 24:20.292
I want those long-range
probes extended.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.667
They're at maximum now.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.750
Well, use the Starfuries
to boost the signal.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.417
I do not want
another situation like this!

24:29.542 --> 24:32.167
Very sloppy of them.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.667
It's as I told you, Na'Tok.

24:33.750 --> 24:37.083
The humans do not have
the stomach for this war.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.875
We will end it
as it should be ended

24:39.958 --> 24:43.083
by striking
the Centauri Homeworld.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.750
If you are with us.

24:47.417 --> 24:51.375
The Narn government has no
special love of the Centauri..

24:51.458 --> 24:53.417
...or its citizens.

24:54.542 --> 24:56.375
We are with you.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.625
[intense music]

25:02.792 --> 25:04.375
(Delenn)
'Is everyone alright?'

25:04.458 --> 25:06.333
Inside the station, yes.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.083
Two Starfury pilots who were
guarding the jumpgate

25:09.167 --> 25:11.833
were wounded, one killed
in the explosion.

25:11.917 --> 25:13.750
Lochley's got the place
buttoned up tight.

25:13.833 --> 25:15.292
They won't get
a second chance.

25:15.375 --> 25:16.958
How badly was
the gate damaged?

25:17.042 --> 25:18.500
(Sheridan)
'Well...it will be
out of commission'

25:18.583 --> 25:20.125
'at least two or three days.'

25:20.208 --> 25:22.667
'That means the civilian
traffic will be stranded.'

25:22.750 --> 25:25.417
Fortunately the White Stars
and most of the other warships

25:25.500 --> 25:27.167
can jump in and out
on their own.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.417
It looks like
...I was worried about you

25:31.500 --> 25:33.583
when I should've been
worried about us.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.750
'How long until
you get to Minbar?'

25:35.833 --> 25:37.625
48 hours your time.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.708
I've already spoken
with the Grey council

25:39.792 --> 25:41.458
told them I need
to talk to them

25:41.542 --> 25:42.667
though I
haven't said why.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.875
'Good.'

25:44.000 --> 25:46.208
And let me know when
they come to a decision.

25:46.292 --> 25:49.958
I could use a little...
good news right about now.

25:50.042 --> 25:51.417
Well..

25:51.500 --> 25:54.208
...I should be getting back
into things, Delenn.

25:54.292 --> 25:57.625
It-it's frantic around here
and with you and Stephen gone--

25:57.708 --> 25:59.958
Stephen is gone? Where?

26:00.042 --> 26:01.917
I thought you knew.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.458
Stephen and Lyta took off
for the Drazi Homeworld

26:04.542 --> 26:07.333
about a day
before you left. Um..

26:07.417 --> 26:10.333
Some kind of mission of mercy.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.667
[instrumental music]

26:20.667 --> 26:22.250
(Lyta)
'If you turn that
the other way, maybe it..'

26:22.333 --> 26:23.792
(Stephen)
'Oh, yeah, you're right.'

26:23.875 --> 26:25.500
(Lyta)
'Why don't you
just ask somebody?'

26:25.583 --> 26:26.958
- No, no, I got a map. Come on.
- What is this with you men?

26:27.042 --> 26:28.875
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.875
[indistinct chatter]

26:31.958 --> 26:33.000
Wow.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.417
Alright, here we go.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.375
We got to stop soon.

26:39.042 --> 26:41.125
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

26:41.208 --> 26:44.500
Yeah, it's the same hotel
that Michael stayed at.

26:44.583 --> 26:47.333
He said the room service
is good and the food is cheap

26:47.417 --> 26:49.792
and the staff is friendly.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.542
Meaning the food stinks,
the rooms are small

26:52.625 --> 26:53.708
and the staff will knife you
in the back

26:53.792 --> 26:54.917
when you're not looking.

26:55.000 --> 26:55.958
Exactly.

26:56.042 --> 26:58.250
Alright.
I think it's, uh..

26:58.333 --> 26:59.542
...it's that way.

26:59.625 --> 27:00.542
Oh..

27:00.625 --> 27:02.333
Now, now, don't worry, alright?

27:02.417 --> 27:04.292
We have a few hours before
our contact.

27:04.375 --> 27:06.250
You got that?
Let's go.

27:07.583 --> 27:10.000
[intense music]

27:17.500 --> 27:20.750
And there is no one more fond
of the regent than I am.

27:20.833 --> 27:22.833
It was I who recommended him
for the position

27:22.917 --> 27:24.292
after the death
of Emperor Cartagia

27:24.375 --> 27:25.875
and the Centaurum agreed.

27:25.958 --> 27:30.042
After having endured so much
pain and suffering he seemed..

27:30.125 --> 27:32.208
...a safe choice.

27:32.292 --> 27:33.542
Apparently we were wrong.

27:33.625 --> 27:34.875
I disagree.

27:34.958 --> 27:37.417
You disagree?
On what basis?

27:37.500 --> 27:40.375
Minister Cholini,
as head of the defense ministry

27:40.458 --> 27:43.167
you know that our ships
have been used to--

27:43.250 --> 27:47.250
Defend the Centauri holdings
from enemy attack, that's all.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.542
That's not true.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.292
I have seen our ships

27:50.375 --> 27:52.542
attack members
of the Alliance.

27:52.625 --> 27:53.917
I'm not responsible
for what you have

27:54.000 --> 27:55.500
and haven't seen,
Prime Minister.

27:55.583 --> 27:57.333
All I can tell you is..

27:57.417 --> 27:59.417
...that I'm in daily contact
with our fleet commanders

27:59.500 --> 28:01.458
and their orders are
straight from the regent

28:01.542 --> 28:02.708
have never altered.

28:02.792 --> 28:05.000
We've been on a strictly
defensive footing

28:05.083 --> 28:09.417
from the beginning.
Anything else is propaganda.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.792
Now, if you wish to move
against the regent

28:11.875 --> 28:13.583
I'm afraid you must
do it without

28:13.667 --> 28:15.875
the backing
of the ministry of defense.

28:15.958 --> 28:17.750
Good day, Mollari.

28:18.792 --> 28:21.333
[intense music]

28:32.208 --> 28:33.583
[door chimes]

28:35.542 --> 28:36.625
[chimes]

28:38.667 --> 28:40.333
[chimes]

28:40.417 --> 28:42.250
What?

28:42.333 --> 28:43.458
Mr. President--

28:43.542 --> 28:45.292
Michael, do you have
to lean on the doorbell?

28:45.375 --> 28:47.333
I'm sorry. I ran all
the way over here.

28:47.417 --> 28:49.000
You gotta see this.

28:49.083 --> 28:50.292
This is the latest
from the rangers

28:50.375 --> 28:51.750
on the disposition
of our forces.

28:51.833 --> 28:53.292
Thirty percent
of the Narn and the Drazi fleet

28:53.375 --> 28:55.292
have gone missing.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.042
What?

28:57.125 --> 28:59.208
They tried to hide it,
but we got the beacon IDs

28:59.292 --> 29:01.042
on all the ships in the area
where fighting's going on.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.958
They left just enough behind
to defend their assets.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.500
The rest took off.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.292
John, I think they're headed
right for Centauri Prime.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.417
No, I need proof.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.792
No. We don't have time.
No, no.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.500
You are the only one
who can stop them.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.000
You gotta get between them
and the target

29:12.083 --> 29:13.167
or we're gonna end up
with quarter million

29:13.250 --> 29:14.417
dead Centauri on our hands

29:14.500 --> 29:16.833
maybe more,
and mainly civilians.

29:16.917 --> 29:18.292
Damn it.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.292
Alright, get me a White Star,
any of 'em.

29:21.375 --> 29:22.958
I don't care,
just so long as it's fast.

29:23.042 --> 29:24.500
How much of a head start
do they have?

29:24.583 --> 29:26.000
That's unknown. Their ships
could have been en route

29:26.083 --> 29:27.750
the whole time we were
meeting with them.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.917
If that's true, Michael,
I'll skin 'em alive.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.250
Come on.

29:33.583 --> 29:36.125
[instrumental music]

29:45.000 --> 29:47.042
[knock on door]

29:50.083 --> 29:51.625
Okay.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.250
- Dr. Franklin?
- Yes.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.042
Dr. Literana Varda.
We spoke.

29:59.125 --> 30:03.000
Yes. Come on in.
I was hoping that was you.

30:03.083 --> 30:05.500
This is my, uh, associate..

30:05.583 --> 30:08.000
...Lyta Alexander.
This is Dr. Varda.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.708
Honored.

30:09.792 --> 30:12.208
'I cannot stay.
We're very busy right now.'

30:12.292 --> 30:14.375
But I have checked
as you asked.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.542
We have no Centauri bodies here.

30:18.542 --> 30:19.708
I see.

30:19.792 --> 30:21.542
And do you know
where the bodies are?

30:21.625 --> 30:23.000
Out there.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.917
I personally surveyed
the damaged ships

30:25.000 --> 30:26.667
and the bodies
were in such disarray

30:26.750 --> 30:28.417
that you could not
put any of them together

30:28.500 --> 30:30.375
and make sense out of it..

30:30.458 --> 30:32.875
'...just parts
floating in space.'

30:32.958 --> 30:35.208
Why are you lying to us?

30:35.292 --> 30:36.750
I'm not.

30:36.833 --> 30:38.458
This is an outrage.

30:38.542 --> 30:40.083
Lyta, down!

30:44.333 --> 30:45.792
Lyta.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.292
[intense music]

31:10.417 --> 31:11.625
[gunshot]

31:12.875 --> 31:15.875
- Varda.
- What are you hiding?

31:15.958 --> 31:17.625
What?

31:17.708 --> 31:19.750
[gasping]

31:25.333 --> 31:27.167
What? What is it?

31:27.250 --> 31:30.083
Take me there. Now!

31:37.542 --> 31:39.833
- Any word from Na'Tok?
- Negative.

31:39.917 --> 31:42.833
Alright. Keep trying.
We're heading out.

31:42.917 --> 31:45.708
I just hope to God
we get there in time.

31:45.792 --> 31:48.000
Here we go again. Hit it.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.667
(male #3)
'Gravimetric engines on-line.'

31:49.750 --> 31:51.625
(male #4)
'Navigational thrusters,
standard ahead.'

32:01.417 --> 32:03.250
[indistinct chatter]

32:07.583 --> 32:09.083
We're two jumps
from home, Delenn.

32:09.167 --> 32:12.333
Good. Any further news
from Babylon 5?

32:12.417 --> 32:14.000
No, not since the..

32:14.083 --> 32:15.583
[beeping]

32:15.667 --> 32:17.917
- What is it?
- Trouble.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.375
I read four Centauri warships,
too many to fight.

32:26.458 --> 32:27.917
Evasive maneuvers.

32:31.667 --> 32:32.875
They've seen us.

32:32.958 --> 32:34.000
Jump to normal space.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.583
Notify Babylon 5 before..

32:36.875 --> 32:38.750
[missiles firing]

32:39.958 --> 32:41.708
[explosion]

32:42.333 --> 32:44.625
[screaming]

32:44.708 --> 32:46.333
[intense music]

33:01.125 --> 33:04.250
Which way?
Which way?

33:04.333 --> 33:06.625
You tell us which way, or I'm
gonna give you back to her.

33:06.708 --> 33:08.167
Do you understand?

33:09.542 --> 33:11.125
Left.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.625
Let's go.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.750
Open it.
Open it!

33:23.833 --> 33:25.208
Let's see what the hell
was so important

33:25.292 --> 33:27.417
you were willing to kill us
for it. Come on.

33:32.667 --> 33:34.458
Holy..

33:38.542 --> 33:40.958
I don't get it. Wh..

33:41.042 --> 33:42.708
Where are all the bodies?
What is this stuff?

33:42.792 --> 33:44.625
There are no bodies.

33:44.708 --> 33:47.125
The attacking
Centauri warships were empty.

33:47.208 --> 33:50.417
'No crew members aboard,
no one to capture'

33:50.500 --> 33:52.333
no bodies to return.

33:52.417 --> 33:55.958
There were only these
attached to the system.

33:56.042 --> 33:57.583
I know this.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.000
I know what this is.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.958
[shot firing]

34:04.208 --> 34:06.292
Run! They're on to us!

34:08.208 --> 34:10.500
Hello, Mollari.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.083
Regent?

34:14.167 --> 34:18.750
I told you we would speak again
before the end.

34:18.833 --> 34:21.625
I've always tried
to keep my promises

34:21.708 --> 34:25.667
especially to those
who have been kind to me..

34:27.167 --> 34:28.458
...as you have been.

34:29.917 --> 34:32.125
It is no burden.

34:32.208 --> 34:36.417
Regent, I've been trying
to see you for some time.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.333
- Our ships--
- Yes.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.083
I know.

34:44.167 --> 34:46.292
Then you gave the order.

34:48.583 --> 34:51.083
After a fashion.

34:51.167 --> 34:54.333
I have always tried
to do the right thing.

34:54.417 --> 34:55.833
You know.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.000
When circumstances allowed.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.417
Yes. We all do, regent.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.083
Yes.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.875
And now it is your time.

35:09.958 --> 35:12.042
Mine is almost over.

35:13.292 --> 35:14.917
I have to say..

35:16.625 --> 35:18.292
I'll be glad of it.

35:20.250 --> 35:23.167
I'm so tired
of it all, Londo.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.042
I'm glad..

35:28.625 --> 35:31.958
I won't live
to see what follows.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.667
Why? What is going to follow?

35:41.625 --> 35:44.042
What do you mean there
weren't any crew aboard?

35:44.125 --> 35:46.750
Garibaldi said that there were
two separate Centauri fleets

35:46.833 --> 35:47.958
engaged in the war..

35:48.042 --> 35:50.042
...one defensive,
one offensive.

35:50.125 --> 35:51.625
But no one in the Centauri
military knew

35:51.708 --> 35:53.167
anything about the attacks

35:53.250 --> 35:55.542
only that they were defending
themselves against us.

35:55.625 --> 35:56.917
Now we know why.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.250
(Sheridan)
'This isn't making sense.'

35:59.333 --> 36:02.667
This is leftover Shadow
technology, Mr. President.

36:02.750 --> 36:04.333
The Vorlons gave me
information on them

36:04.417 --> 36:05.875
in case I ever
ran across one

36:05.958 --> 36:07.583
and I understand
a few years ago

36:07.667 --> 36:09.625
one was found
by the Psi Corps.

36:09.708 --> 36:11.250
It's an organic device

36:11.333 --> 36:14.000
used to control a ship
from a long distance.

36:14.083 --> 36:16.792
You put two or three of these
onboard a starship

36:16.875 --> 36:18.750
and you don't even
need a crew.

36:18.833 --> 36:20.750
Well, then how the hell
did the Centauri

36:20.833 --> 36:22.083
get their hands on them?

36:22.167 --> 36:23.917
Well, that's
the real question.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Now, we know that a lot of the
aliens who worked

36:26.083 --> 36:28.417
for the Shadows got away
with a lot of their technology.

36:28.500 --> 36:29.792
How much, we don't know.

36:29.875 --> 36:32.000
But it's possible
that one of these races

36:32.083 --> 36:33.917
sold the stuff
to the Centauri.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
With the cooperation
of a few others in charge

36:36.083 --> 36:38.583
of the military, the regent
could run an offensive war

36:38.667 --> 36:41.083
without anybody in the military
knowing anything about it.

36:41.167 --> 36:43.208
But there's
another possibility.

36:43.292 --> 36:45.292
A third party could
use these devices

36:45.375 --> 36:48.458
to set up the Centauri,
turn everyone against them.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.458
And the Drazi, they wouldn't
tell anybody about these things.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.167
They've always competed
with the Centauri for trade.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.917
A war would be
in their best interest.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.458
Besides, this is, this is
pretty advanced technology.

36:58.542 --> 37:00.667
If they told the Alliance,
they'd have to turn over

37:00.750 --> 37:02.208
the devices for study.

37:02.292 --> 37:04.708
And meanwhile,
the attacks go on.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.708
Of course.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.375
Of course!

37:10.458 --> 37:11.792
That's why we couldn't
figure out a strategy

37:11.875 --> 37:13.375
behind the random attacks.

37:13.458 --> 37:16.583
We couldn't see a goal
because there was no goal.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.625
There was no strategy
beyond alienating

37:18.708 --> 37:21.625
everyone in the Alliance,
turn them against the Centauri

37:21.708 --> 37:23.083
so that..

37:24.792 --> 37:27.583
So they'd attack.

37:27.667 --> 37:30.125
'Listen, all the White Stars
in your area are out.'

37:30.208 --> 37:32.625
'Can you get out of there
in one piece?'

37:32.708 --> 37:34.167
I think so.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.583
Good. Get ahold
of Garibaldi if you can.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.333
Tell him he has to
keep trying to reach

37:38.417 --> 37:39.667
the Drazi and Narn fleets.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.000
Now, they are jamming us

37:41.083 --> 37:42.250
but he has to get through
to them

37:42.333 --> 37:43.750
before it's too late.

37:43.833 --> 37:45.625
Give me everything you've got!

37:45.708 --> 37:48.708
The lives of several million
people are riding on this.

37:53.333 --> 37:55.167
[intense music]

38:03.583 --> 38:06.083
[sparks crackling]

38:18.958 --> 38:21.000
[groaning]

38:25.708 --> 38:26.958
Delenn.

38:28.625 --> 38:30.917
Lennier..

38:31.000 --> 38:32.417
What..

38:32.500 --> 38:34.208
Delenn..

38:34.292 --> 38:35.708
...we've been hit..

38:35.792 --> 38:37.625
...badly.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.667
I've managed to get
to the consoles

38:39.750 --> 38:41.750
and check
on our condition.

38:41.833 --> 38:43.458
How bad is it?

38:45.042 --> 38:47.333
Jump engines
are off-line.

38:47.417 --> 38:49.542
Most of the crew..

38:49.625 --> 38:50.958
...are dead.

38:52.333 --> 38:55.042
There are a few survivors
on a lower deck.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.792
They can't get past
the debris between levels.

38:59.833 --> 39:03.042
We have enough power
in our navigational thrusters

39:03.125 --> 39:05.958
to keep from going too far
off the beacon

39:06.042 --> 39:09.042
but-but once
they run out

39:09.125 --> 39:11.000
we'll start to drift.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.875
Distress signal.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.458
Activated..

39:14.542 --> 39:17.083
...but I can't tell if
it's working or not.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.417
And my leg..

39:20.500 --> 39:24.042
...appears to be broken
in two places.

39:25.750 --> 39:27.958
This is bad, then.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.167
Very bad, Delenn.

39:31.250 --> 39:33.500
[intense music]

39:37.333 --> 39:40.042
[intense music]

40:08.333 --> 40:10.958
It's going to be
a pretty night..

40:11.917 --> 40:15.792
...the last one
I will ever see.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.958
You shouldn't talk
that way, regent.

40:18.042 --> 40:20.125
You still have
many years ahead of you.

40:20.208 --> 40:22.833
That's why it's important
to recall the ships.

40:22.917 --> 40:24.500
We can still make peace.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.833
Oh, there will be peace..

40:26.917 --> 40:28.500
...for a while.

40:28.583 --> 40:31.333
It never lasts, really.

40:31.417 --> 40:33.167
They said so.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.000
They said both things,
actually

40:35.083 --> 40:38.375
that there will be peace
and that it won't last.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.333
They also said

40:41.417 --> 40:44.625
I would be dead
by morning..

40:44.708 --> 40:46.417
...and that tomorrow..

40:47.958 --> 40:50.625
...you will be emperor.

40:50.708 --> 40:53.208
'They said
many, many things..'

40:53.292 --> 40:56.083
...things I didn't
want to hear..

40:57.500 --> 41:00.833
...things I didn't understand..

41:00.917 --> 41:05.583
...and things I didn't
want to understand.

41:05.667 --> 41:07.375
"They?"

41:07.458 --> 41:09.542
Who are they, regent?

41:09.625 --> 41:14.542
Oh, you will find out for
yourself soon enough, Londo.

41:14.625 --> 41:20.000
You shouldn't rush
your last free hours.

41:20.083 --> 41:23.375
And there was something else
they told me..

41:23.458 --> 41:25.000
...to do..

41:26.917 --> 41:28.458
...and I did it just
a few moments

41:28.542 --> 41:30.708
before I came to see you.

41:33.792 --> 41:37.250
The last thing I will ever
have to do for them..

41:38.583 --> 41:40.625
...and in a way..

41:40.708 --> 41:44.083
...I'm glad it's over.

41:44.167 --> 41:46.292
What did they ask you to do?

41:48.958 --> 41:51.750
To send away
all the ships..

41:51.833 --> 41:55.167
...guarding Centauri prime..

41:55.250 --> 41:57.458
...on a false emergency..

41:59.958 --> 42:05.333
...and turn off the planetary
defense network.

42:05.417 --> 42:06.625
No!

42:08.583 --> 42:11.292
I think I'll stay..

42:11.375 --> 42:13.500
...and watch from here.

42:13.583 --> 42:16.333
The sky should be lighting up
anytime now.

42:17.708 --> 42:19.583
I imagine..

42:19.667 --> 42:21.833
...it will be..

42:21.917 --> 42:24.250
...quite beautiful.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.458
No!

42:26.542 --> 42:29.583
[dramatic music]

42:44.542 --> 42:47.625
[music continues]

43:12.042 --> 43:13.833
No.

43:13.917 --> 43:15.458
[intense music]

43:16.917 --> 43:19.667
