<i>James.</i>

00:44.779 --> 00:45.644
<i>James.</i>

00:45.646 --> 00:46.412
What?

00:46.414 --> 00:49.515
<i>- I want you to stay in
the car on this one.</i>

00:49.517 --> 00:50.356
Why?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.484
<i>You know why.</i>

00:55.423 --> 00:56.655
That's not gonna
happen again.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.323
<i>That's what you said
the last time.</i>

00:59.427 --> 01:01.760
<i>I'm not going
through that shit again.</i>

01:07.301 --> 01:07.966
Yeah.

01:07.968 --> 01:08.734
Whatever you say.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.537
<i>Hey. Look at me.</i>

01:12.339 --> 01:14.640
<i>If I need you,
I'll let you know.</i>

01:14.642 --> 01:17.810
<i>Otherwise stay in the fucking
car and don't move.</i>

01:18.279 --> 01:19.545
Yeah.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.315
<i>Now what are you gonna do?</i>

01:23.317 --> 01:25.617
I'm gonna stay in
the fucking car-

01:25.619 --> 01:27.719
Until you need me.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.390
<i>A man's only as
good as his word.</i>

01:31.392 --> 01:36.161
<i>So if I see you out
there, we're through.</i>

01:36.163 --> 01:37.830
<i>Understand?</i>

01:38.632 --> 01:39.765
Yeah.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.267
<i>Good.</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:48.340
<i>Alright.
Here we go.</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:35.921
<i>Jesus Christ! Get back
in the car, Downey.</i>

02:36.657 --> 02:37.589
James!

02:38.826 --> 02:40.092
You like to hit people.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.326
Huh?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.328
Yeah, why don't you try
hitting me, you fuck?

02:43.998 --> 02:44.830
Arrgh.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.583
Thinks he's tough.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.267
Take his cuffs off and
see how tough he is.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.870
Take 'em off,
tough guy.

02:51.872 --> 02:52.838
Tough guy.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.311
<i>Stop!</i>

03:01.182 --> 03:03.682
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

03:05.653 --> 03:06.752
Unbelievable.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.986
Un-fucking-believable.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.622
Get him in the car.
Let's go.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.500
Let's go asshole.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.615
Hey!

06:05.866 --> 06:08.500
<i>Oh Donny!
Donny Donny P!</i>

06:08.902 --> 06:10.235
Right on time.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.371
<i>Charlie, my man.</i>

06:12.373 --> 06:15.640
Yeah. Alright?
Yeah, we're good?

06:18.579 --> 06:22.147
Ohhhh.
Funny, funny guy.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.014
All good.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.083
Good. Good.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.052
I like that.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.054
Count it.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.357
That's new.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.592
Yeah.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.560
I got sent it sent
over last week.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.828
Needed some
good music.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.264
If I have to listen to one
more diabetic fat man

06:39.266 --> 06:40.532
playing the
fucking accordion

06:40.534 --> 06:42.667
I'm gonna cut my ears off.
You know what I mean?

06:42.669 --> 06:44.136
I mean, right?

06:44.138 --> 06:46.238
Fucking hell man. They told me
it was gonna be beautiful here.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.807
Ir's like a fucking third rate
Ireland at best, isn't it?

06:48.809 --> 06:51.243
Ireland's already shit,
you know.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.113
It's like all the fucking Irish
retards come over here.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.315
They start fucking each other
and making more fucking retards.

06:57.317 --> 07:01.787
How does it feel to be the descendant
of a bunch of fucking retards?

07:03.791 --> 07:04.689
<i>Oh-oh.</i>

07:05.426 --> 07:08.026
Somebody's getting
his feelings hurt.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.396
I'm not hurt.
I just don't agree.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.164
That's all.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.165
<i>Of course you don't.</i>

07:13.166 --> 07:14.165
<i>'Cause you've lived
here too long.</i>

07:14.166 --> 07:16.166
<i>Can't even smell
the shit anymore.</i>

07:17.037 --> 07:18.837
Maybe.

07:19.907 --> 07:20.939
<i>So?</i>

07:22.242 --> 07:23.742
No problems then, eh?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.844
Nothing we should know about?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.179
<i>No.</i>

07:27.948 --> 07:29.214
You're not using, then?

07:31.118 --> 07:31.983
<i>What?</i>

07:31.985 --> 07:34.152
Don't laugh.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.222
Are you using?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.759
Charlie. Jesus.
Come on, man.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.561
I'm not fucking using.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.397
<i>Don't do that.
Don't fucking lie to me.</i>

07:45.399 --> 07:47.833
<i>That just makes you
look stupid.</i>

07:47.835 --> 07:50.035
<i>Do you think I'm
gonna ask a question like</i>

07:50.037 --> 07:52.204
<i>I don't already know
the fucking answer?</i>

07:53.307 --> 07:54.673
Do I look stupid?

07:55.709 --> 07:56.675
<i>You're not stupid.</i>

07:56.677 --> 07:58.243
I'm not stupid.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.080
So answer
the fucking question.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.250
Are you using?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.121
It's just a little bit.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.290
It's nothing.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.626
<i>It's nothing.
It's nothing.</i>

08:15.596 --> 08:18.864
<i>You know I've heard
of that before.</i>

08:20.067 --> 08:23.635
When I was coming up, I was
paired up with a guy like you.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.772
Umm, what was his fucking name?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.677
Shit, I can't think of his name.

08:34.548 --> 08:38.817
Anyway. Nice guy.
Good guy. Funny.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.986
Everybody liked him.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.856
And then he started to
get a little bit loose.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.124
You know.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.995
Started partying a little bit.
Starting living the life.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.063
Brendan Hutchinson.
Brendan fucking Hutchinson.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.265
That's his name.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.834
Called him Hutch.

08:55.836 --> 09:00.272
So the boss started to notice that
standards were getting a little bit low-

09:00.274 --> 09:01.940
So far as Hutch was concerned.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.442
So he pulled him aside
to have a wee chat.

09:05.979 --> 09:09.915
Of course, Hutch told him
everything he wanted to hear.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.850
But nothing changed.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.255
So next the boss
man comes to me.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.458
And he asks me to do
something rather specific.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.828
Made my stomach churn,
thinking about it.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.132
But you don't say no
to a guy like that.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.967
So I fucking did it.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.304
I cut his fucking nose off.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.842
<i>And you know, the
sound that he made-</i>

09:38.378 --> 09:39.945
<i>was like this really-</i>

09:39.947 --> 09:44.149
weird high pitched screaming.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.117
Never heard anything like that.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.020
I didn't think a man could
make a sound like that.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.190
<i>Point was, in the end-</i>

09:52.192 --> 09:54.826
<i>He couldn't snort that shit
anymore, could he?</i>

09:57.297 --> 10:00.398
He killed himself six weeks
later. The poor fucker.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.775
Do you want to have a go
with the juke box?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.078
<i>It's all good shit.
Hand picked by-</i>

10:14.214 --> 10:14.879
<i>- by me.</i>

10:14.881 --> 10:17.382
<i>What the fuck is that?</i>

10:17.384 --> 10:19.017
Sorry. It's my wife.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.687
You see, you don't leave your fucking
phone on in a meeting like that.

10:22.689 --> 10:23.755
You understand?

10:23.757 --> 10:24.956
That's disrespect.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.424
<i>I know.
It's just that she-</i>

10:26.426 --> 10:27.525
You're fucking kidding me.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.493
<i>Fuck!</i>

10:30.263 --> 10:32.230
Ah, for Christ Almighty.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.433
Cut his fucking nose off!

10:35.435 --> 10:36.201
<i>What?</i>

10:36.203 --> 10:37.402
<i>No wait!</i>

10:37.404 --> 10:39.337
What the fuck?
Just wait!

10:51.184 --> 10:55.053
Jesus fuck.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.335
Check his trousers. See
if he's pissed himself.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.107
Oh!

11:22.215 --> 11:23.782
<i>Oh man!</i>

11:28.855 --> 11:31.056
The look on your face, man.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.393
<i>Can I fuckin' go?</i>

11:35.395 --> 11:38.530
What? You don't wanna
stay and dance with us a bit.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.365
Hey, hey, hey!

11:40.367 --> 11:42.000
Charlie!
What the fuck man!

11:43.270 --> 11:44.102
Come on!

11:44.104 --> 11:44.769
Tanz!

11:44.771 --> 11:45.770
Come on!
What the fuck!

11:45.772 --> 11:47.539
Bang! Bang! Bang!

11:47.541 --> 11:49.441
Jesus!

11:50.977 --> 11:53.044
What the fuck, Charlie?

11:53.747 --> 11:54.679
Bang!

11:54.681 --> 11:57.348
Fuck! Fuck!

12:00.153 --> 12:01.619
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alright. Alright.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.188
Get the fuck out of here.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.622
<i>Get out!</i>

12:04.624 --> 12:06.057
<i>Go call your fucking wife.</i>

12:08.695 --> 12:10.261
<i>Danny! Danny!</i>

12:13.366 --> 12:15.066
Don't get sloppy.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.462
Hey, what's up?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.166
What?

13:31.478 --> 13:32.710
<i>Hello?</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:34.646
<i>Speaking.</i>

13:38.118 --> 13:39.617
What?

13:43.657 --> 13:44.656
What?

13:50.831 --> 13:54.098
Don't do anything
'til I get there.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.038
How was the flight?

15:07.307 --> 15:12.076
Fine.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.249
Here you are.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.219
Where is she?

15:21.688 --> 15:22.587
Right there.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.155
No, where's the casket?

15:24.891 --> 15:27.892
Uh...
She's been cremated.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.560
No. Where's her body?

15:30.597 --> 15:34.632
There is no body.
She's been cremated.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.468
Who told you to do that?

15:37.837 --> 15:38.937
<i>Her son.</i>

15:38.939 --> 15:40.505
I'm her son.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.940
<i>Your brother, then.</i>

15:41.942 --> 15:43.341
I don't have a brother.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.610
<i>Danny.
He signed off on-</i>

15:45.612 --> 15:48.246
He's not my brother.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.917
<i>I'm sorry if there's
been a misunderstanding.</i>

15:52.919 --> 15:57.722
You telling me I gotta say
goodbye to a pile of fuckin' dust?

15:59.726 --> 16:02.927
<i>Uh...</i>

16:02.929 --> 16:05.363
That fuckin' asshole.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.198
Fuck him.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.473
Not too much jam, please.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.141
Mm hmm.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.644
You're old enough. You should
be making it yourself.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.279
I like it when Mom makes it.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.114
I like it when Mom makes it.

16:23.116 --> 16:23.781
Travis.

16:23.783 --> 16:24.482
Ow!

16:24.484 --> 16:26.551
Hey! It's fine.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.057
Morning.

16:33.059 --> 16:33.858
<i>Good Morning.</i>

16:36.162 --> 16:37.662
Did you get any sleep?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.463
Some.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.699
I can't believe they're making
you work the night shift.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.334
You shouldn't have to
be working at all.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.635
We need the money, Jess.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.287
I can't take time off.

16:46.288 --> 16:47.938
Still, they should be giving you
paid leave or something.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.807
Weill. I don't know
what to tell you.

16:49.809 --> 16:50.942
I would if I could.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.043
Hey.

16:52.045 --> 16:56.047
A little early for that,
don't you think?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.148
I'm mourning.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.282
Yeah, I'm
mourning too.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.651
You don't see me
drinking at 10 a.m.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.620
Well, you're not me.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.223
You guys know we're going to
Auntie Rose's wake this evening?

17:05.224 --> 17:06.023
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:06.026 --> 17:06.891
<i>Mmm hmmm.</i>

17:06.893 --> 17:08.425
Good.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.561
I told Val we'd give
him a drive.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.196
Fine.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.401
<i>Is Uncle
Jimmy gonna be there?</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:20.137
Don't fuckin' call him that.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.172
He's not your uncle.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.340
He's my cousin. Okay?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.376
And we don't talk to
him if he's there.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.978
That goes for everyone.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.679
He can go fuck himself!

17:28.681 --> 17:30.214
Language.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.416
She's old enough.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.950
<i>Mom. Toast please.</i>

17:32.952 --> 17:35.386
Coming, sweetheart.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.388
<i>I'm going out.</i>

17:37.390 --> 17:39.590
<i>Hey. Be back by two.</i>

17:39.592 --> 17:40.958
<i>Two.</i>

17:42.862 --> 17:44.062
Hey Travis. Get back here.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.096
<i>Why?</i>

17:45.098 --> 17:45.997
Travis!

17:45.999 --> 17:47.632
<i>What?</i>

17:47.634 --> 17:50.101
Come in and put your bowl
in the dishwasher.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.736
She's your mother.
Not your slave.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.671
Go.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.979
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

18:03.783 --> 18:04.916
Hey.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.117
Back by two, got it?

18:06.119 --> 18:08.319
Jesus fucking Christ!
What is your problem?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.822
<i>Language!</i>

18:10.824 --> 18:13.691
I loved her.
I wanna be there.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.761
Jess. We're in our own home.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.397
Who gives a fuck if we say
a couple of fucks?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.799
This is not what I
want modeled for her.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.568
You got it?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.406
<i>It's okay.</i>

18:34.714 --> 18:36.647
<i>How's it going,
Jimmy b'y?</i>

18:37.917 --> 18:39.417
Roy Burns.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.053
Wow.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.521
Good turnout, eh?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.639
Yeah.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.756
Good turnout.
A lot of people here.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.426
<i>Yeah, she was a lovely woman.</i>

18:49.062 --> 18:50.661
<i>Shame Gus isn't here, eh?</i>

18:51.564 --> 18:53.698
No. Gus is right where
he should be, Roy.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.300
<i>Still, a man should be able
to mourn his wife.</i>

18:56.936 --> 18:58.035
No matter the circumstances.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.504
Circumstances?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.038
Roy, you don't have a fuckin'
clue about the circumstances.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.340
If I do say so.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.009
So, why don't you just stop
talking now, alright?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.044
Roy Burns?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.846
Long time no see.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.680
Doug. How you doing?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.884
What the fuck kinda
question is that, Roy?

19:12.886 --> 19:16.053
My sister-in-law's sitting right
there in a fuckin' urn.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.723
Pretty obvious I'm
not doing too good.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.224
Don't you think?

19:20.226 --> 19:22.793
No I... I just meant...

19:22.795 --> 19:24.595
I'm just fuckin' with you.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.465
But if you could fuck off-

19:27.467 --> 19:29.033
That would be great.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.802
I wanna catch up
with my nephew here.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.572
Of course. Yeah.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.975
Um. Sorry for your
troubles, there, Jimmy.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.047
Good to see you, my son.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.185
How's Toronto treating you?

19:47.187 --> 19:49.053
I see you got you some
fancy fuckin' clothes.

19:50.123 --> 19:51.856
Yeah, at least mine
got sleeves, Doug.

19:51.858 --> 19:52.623
What the hell?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.159
It's either this or
pit stains, Jimmy.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.627
I runs hot.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.629
<i>Is your cousin here?</i>

19:58.631 --> 19:59.630
No.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.199
<i>James?</i>

20:01.201 --> 20:01.999
Yup.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.036
<i>Father O'Brien, over at
St. Patrick's Cathedral.</i>

20:05.038 --> 20:07.438
Take it somewhere else,
Father. We don't need it.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.509
You heard me.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.110
Fuckin' pedophile.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.079
Come on now.
There's no need for that.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.815
You're fuckin' right
there's no need.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.616
Hey.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.719
It's not worth it.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.889
Sorry for your loss.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.525
Why'd you do that?

20:27.527 --> 20:28.960
I coulda made him cry.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.562
I didn't wanna see my uncle
arrested at my mother's wake.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.231
I wasn't gonna hit him.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.834
Was gonna whisper a few
things in his ear.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.204
So. Where're you staying
while you're in town?

20:40.206 --> 20:42.039
I got a spare
room, if you needs it.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.976
Nah, I'm good.
Thank you.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.078
I'm gonna stay at the house
and deal with that whole mess.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.380
<i>Right on.</i>

20:50.617 --> 20:54.151
Well. I hope it's not too hard
for you to be there, you know.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.554
How long ago
was it you-

20:56.556 --> 20:58.389
<i>You left her there?</i>

20:58.391 --> 20:59.824
<i>Seven years now?</i>

21:02.695 --> 21:03.861
Eight.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.663
Eight. Right. Right.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.633
She died there, too.
Poor thing.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.169
All alone.
No husband.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.170
No son.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.808
Jeez, I don't know how
you can stomach that guilt.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.044
I'd wanna kill myself,
if I was you, Jimmy.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.479
Fuck.

21:25.351 --> 21:28.119
<i>What? You can't take
a fuckin' joke?</i>

21:28.121 --> 21:30.054
<i>Jimmy?
Jesus.</i>

23:07.286 --> 23:08.586
Holy Shit.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.922
Looka this fuckin' guy.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.493
<i>What are you doing sitting over there in
your car like some kinda fuckin' creep?</i>

23:15.495 --> 23:16.527
Same thing you're doing.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.997
I don't wanna see your
fuckin' family.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.299
They fuckin' hate me.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.136
I'm not gonna settle
for a handshake.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.904
Gimme a hug,
you bastard.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.240
Hey. It's good to see you.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.108
Yeah, you too John.
How are you?

23:31.110 --> 23:31.876
Not bad.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.077
Not bad.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.612
I can't complain.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.414
I got my health.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.750
So, what's there to
complain about?

23:42.455 --> 23:44.288
I...

23:46.526 --> 23:48.259
I'm sorry about your mom.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.361
I tried to call you.

23:50.363 --> 23:51.829
Did you get my message?

23:52.265 --> 23:53.431
I don't know.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.533
I turned my phone off as
soon as I found out.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.834
Gotta block out all that noise.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.272
Only you would call people
caring about you noise.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.078
So.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.148
How are things
in the big city?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.216
Fine.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.151
Keeps me busy. You know.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.921
Must be more action
than when you were here.

24:16.923 --> 24:17.888
I imagine.

24:18.157 --> 24:18.989
Yeah.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.175
Yeah definitely.

24:21.176 --> 24:23.360
I don't have every second person
wanna stop and have a chat.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.728
Like around here.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.364
I'm home a day already I wanna
slit my fuckin' throat.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.200
God.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.469
Jimmy Power.
The lone wolf.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.971
It's James Downey. Now.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.408
Huh? Keeping your mother's
maiden name alive.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.442
Yeah.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.743
I like that.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.082
How are things around here?

24:46.919 --> 24:48.252
Shit.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.822
Drugs are outta control.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.791
Things are going
down the toilet.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.960
Jesus Christ.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.830
Ever hear from Gus?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.869
Yeah.
Check in now and then.

25:04.871 --> 25:09.006
Doing his time.
Not making any waves.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.842
He's hoping to get out for
good behavior, I s'pose.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.112
Or he's just waiting to die.

25:15.515 --> 25:16.747
Yeah.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.318
You ever think
about what we did?

25:24.924 --> 25:26.790
Jesus.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.293
I fuckin' knew you
were gonna say that.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.495
No.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.998
I don't think about it.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.967
What's done is done.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.203
There's no point
talking about it.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.438
It won't change anything.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.010
Yeah.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.718
To Rose.

25:55.288 --> 25:56.754
<i>To Rose. To Rose.</i>

26:01.961 --> 26:03.894
<i>And to Gus.
He should be here too.</i>

26:03.896 --> 26:04.662
<i>He should.</i>

26:04.664 --> 26:05.729
<i>And Jimmy too.</i>

26:06.499 --> 26:08.332
I'm not fuckin'
drinking to that.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.367
<i>I can't believe
he didn't come.</i>

26:10.369 --> 26:13.737
I mean, your own mother and you
don't show up to the funeral.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.738
That's messed up.

26:15.775 --> 26:16.840
Yeah, that's classic Jimmy.
That's what that is.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.442
Times are tough.
And he runs away.

26:18.444 --> 26:21.145
<i>Maybe he didn't
want to deal with all of you.</i>

26:21.147 --> 26:23.514
Maybe he's a prick and he
did something prickish.

26:23.516 --> 26:25.983
Why are we talking
about him? Val?

26:25.985 --> 26:27.851
Why the fuck did you
bring him up?

26:27.853 --> 26:29.587
<i>Jeez.
I thought it was weird.</i>

26:29.589 --> 26:31.221
Yeah it was weird. We
knew that already.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.357
But you don't gotta keep
fuckin' talking about him?

26:33.359 --> 26:35.125
<i>Jesus Christ.
Let it alone Danny.</i>

26:35.127 --> 26:38.996
<i>Can we just please
keep this about Rose, hmm?</i>

26:38.998 --> 26:40.331
That's what I'm
trying to do.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.566
And then Val brought
up that piece of shit.

26:42.568 --> 26:43.500
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

26:43.502 --> 26:44.468
<i>I brought him up.</i>

26:44.470 --> 26:45.603
What. Whoever.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.870
Can we just -

26:46.872 --> 26:49.573
Please. Nobody say his
fuckin' name again.

26:49.575 --> 26:50.307
Okay?

26:52.945 --> 26:53.744
Okay.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.347
Okay?

26:56.349 --> 26:57.081
Okay!

26:59.118 --> 27:00.184
Thank you.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.058
Sarah. What's your favorite
Auntie Rose memory?

27:08.361 --> 27:09.827
<i>Ummm.</i>

27:10.930 --> 27:13.797
The time me and Travis
caught her cheating at cards.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.666
But she was only cheating

27:15.668 --> 27:18.535
<i>so she could lose and
give us her money.</i>

27:20.640 --> 27:21.472
<i>Amazing.</i>

27:21.474 --> 27:22.940
How much did she give you?

27:22.942 --> 27:24.108
A lot.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.075
<i>Good job.</i>

27:26.112 --> 27:29.880
What's your favorite Auntie
Rose memory, Travis?

29:27.333 --> 29:28.265
<i>Hey.</i>

29:29.835 --> 29:31.568
Time for bed.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.670
Mom. I'm fine.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.572
Come on. Go to bed.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.409
Val. Gimmie a tattoo.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.645
<i>Here we go.</i>

29:41.647 --> 29:43.046
<i>What?</i>

29:43.048 --> 29:45.349
I want a tattoo for Rose.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.150
<i>Aw Jesus.</i>

29:46.452 --> 29:47.451
<i>Okay.</i>

29:48.420 --> 29:51.488
<i>Okay, well,
what's it gonna be?</i>

29:54.960 --> 29:56.693
I dunno.
What should I get?

29:57.563 --> 29:59.296
<i>How about a rose?</i>

30:00.132 --> 30:03.667
Jesus Christ.
That's fuckin' terrible.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.836
That's cheesy
as fuck, man.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.237
<i>I dunno, man.</i>

30:08.507 --> 30:10.874
You telling me you can draw
a fuckin' rose on me?

30:10.876 --> 30:12.042
You're loaded drunk, Val.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.377
You that fuckin' stupid?

30:13.379 --> 30:15.479
Get the fuck outta
here with that shit.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.480
<i>Hey!</i>

30:17.316 --> 30:18.549
<i>You asked for help.
He's helping.</i>

30:18.551 --> 30:20.151
<i>What more do you want?</i>

30:20.152 --> 30:21.752
What a good idea. What
the fuck's your problem?

30:21.754 --> 30:24.188
<i>How about Rose?</i>

30:24.723 --> 30:26.723
<i>Across your knuckles.</i>

30:27.226 --> 30:28.158
See?

30:29.461 --> 30:30.227
See?

30:30.963 --> 30:33.130
There's a fuckin' idea.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.465
My son.

30:40.706 --> 30:41.705
My beautiful son.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.374
How about you
sleep on this one?

30:44.376 --> 30:45.342
You know.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.011
Before you...

30:48.013 --> 30:50.080
<i>permanently mutilate your body.</i>

30:50.082 --> 30:51.415
<i>Like a fuckin' idiot.</i>

30:51.417 --> 30:53.617
Yeah, why don't you shut
your fuckin' face now.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.819
And go back to your welfare
apartment, you cunt.

30:55.821 --> 30:56.553
Hey.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.295
<i>Get offa him.</i>

31:04.296 --> 31:05.963
The problem with you, is
your dad just fucked and left.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.065
And no one ever beat any
sense into you.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.766
<i>Stop it!</i>

31:09.768 --> 31:11.835
Eh? You hear me?
You little prick.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.570
You learning now?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.639
<i>Let him go!</i>

31:15.641 --> 31:16.573
Shit!

31:17.476 --> 31:18.909
<i>Jesus! I'm sorry, luv.</i>

31:18.911 --> 31:20.744
Get the fuck out,
Doug!

31:20.746 --> 31:23.180
Oh. I, I...

31:24.817 --> 31:26.483
<i>Get the fuck out.</i>

31:36.095 --> 31:38.195
Why couldn't you just go to bed?

31:38.197 --> 31:39.162
Huh?

31:46.755 --> 31:47.671
<i>Jesus Mom.
What the fuck?</i>

31:47.673 --> 31:49.072
Don't you swear at your mother!

31:50.009 --> 31:52.542
Christ, you're just
like the rest of them!

31:53.445 --> 31:55.279
We're supposed to be
here for Rose.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.281
And this is what she gets.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.317
<i>Sorry. Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

32:04.189 --> 32:06.690
Travis. Go. To bed.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.425
<i>Okay.</i>

32:12.631 --> 32:14.364
Jesus!

32:15.801 --> 32:17.367
Give me a sec.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.078
Thanks for having me.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.313
Goodnight Val.

32:33.719 --> 32:34.551
Fuck!

32:42.895 --> 32:44.194
I'm going to bed.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.367
If you're not careful.
you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.803
I exercise so I don't give
myself a heart attack.

34:32.804 --> 34:33.937
That wasn't exercise.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.306
That was masochism.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.009
What do you want, Doug?

34:39.011 --> 34:43.179
Jesus! Is that how you welcome
someone into your home in Toronto?

34:43.181 --> 34:45.549
They really are
assholes up there.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.853
Okay.
You gonna make me say it?

34:52.190 --> 34:53.790
I'm sorry.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.992
About what I said at the wake.

34:58.564 --> 34:59.596
Happy?

35:00.899 --> 35:02.833
James.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.236
You got any juice to drink,
or what?

35:06.805 --> 35:08.338
Excuse me.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.874
Jesus Christ!
Are you drunk?

35:11.777 --> 35:14.444
<i>I was. Just haven't slept yet.</i>

35:14.947 --> 35:16.313
Did you drive here?

35:16.882 --> 35:18.448
No one was on the road.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.319
I was just a little
tipsy, officer.

35:22.855 --> 35:23.653
You gonna lecture me?

35:24.690 --> 35:26.556
You're too fuckin'
old to change now.

35:26.892 --> 35:27.757
That I am.

35:27.759 --> 35:28.792
You want some water?

35:28.794 --> 35:30.827
No. Never drinks it.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.195
You never drink water.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.430
Never.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.464
And I'm the one that' gonna
have a heart attack?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.133
You kidding me?

35:36.135 --> 35:37.367
Got any Eggos?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.870
No Doug, I don't have any
Eggos. I have water.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.438
You're a shit host, Jimmy.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.539
You invited yourself in here.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.509
I know. I'm just
pulling your dick.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.878
It's good having you home.

35:48.147 --> 35:48.845
Yeah?

35:48.847 --> 35:49.513
Yeah.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.947
Sure doesn't feel like it.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.417
I'm only speaking
for myself.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.888
You're cousin, now.
He's...

35:58.857 --> 36:00.190
What is it they say?

36:00.192 --> 36:01.992
He's got issues.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.366
Listen Doug.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.434
I have a lot of stuff
to do around here.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.437
So if you could just get
to the point.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.940
Yeah.

36:25.884 --> 36:29.586
Have you heard about all the
drugs going around?

36:30.322 --> 36:31.988
<i>I have.</i>

36:32.758 --> 36:34.457
Normally I wouldn't care.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.859
Have at 'er, I'd say.

36:35.861 --> 36:39.129
But it's brought in
some people from away.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.664
Bad lot.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.934
And they've got their
hooks in Danny.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.069
He helped him get set up.

36:46.071 --> 36:47.871
And now he's selling
coke for him.

36:48.774 --> 36:52.008
But of course, he's
not just selling it.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.443
<i>You know Danny.</i>

36:53.445 --> 36:55.378
<i>More, more, more.</i>

36:55.380 --> 36:56.980
Yeah, right.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.851
<i>Now back in the day,
your father and I woulda handled this.</i>

37:01.853 --> 37:06.790
And if he was here now,
maybe we'd still handle it.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.593
But he's not.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.962
That's on you.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.366
So, the way I see it-

37:16.368 --> 37:18.568
You gotta handle this.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.438
<i>Look, what I do is-</i>

37:21.439 --> 37:23.039
a lot different than
what you and Gus did.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.509
Okay, I'm a cop, I can't
do what you want me to do.

37:30.716 --> 37:34.985
No. It wasn't
that different.

37:34.987 --> 37:39.122
We took money from people
to keep things straight.

37:39.124 --> 37:40.423
We kept people safe.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.092
Yeah, we did things
cops wouldn't do.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.361
But it was for
the community.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.796
<i>Oh, it was for
the community?</i>

37:46.798 --> 37:49.599
Yeah, except if they didn't what
to pay you for what you did,

37:49.601 --> 37:51.001
you'd burn their store down.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.702
That is very noble of you guys.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.237
<i>Now, now.
Don't get it twisted.</i>

37:54.239 --> 37:55.338
<i>We did some good.</i>

37:55.340 --> 37:56.906
We handled that fuck
who touched Danny.

37:56.908 --> 38:00.210
You know the cops wouldn't have
done right by him the way we did.

38:00.212 --> 38:02.045
And so we took some
money from people.

38:02.047 --> 38:02.712
Big fuckin' deal.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.913
We had to make a living.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.915
Your father had to put
food on the table.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.485
<i>My father had to
put booze in his belly.</i>

38:09.521 --> 38:11.621
Well, I dunno.
Life is hard.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.624
Yeah. It is. For some
more than others.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.526
It is.

38:17.362 --> 38:19.162
<i>So, where the fuck
were you?</i>

38:19.164 --> 38:19.929
Wha?

38:19.931 --> 38:20.997
Where the fuck were you?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.065
You saw the bruises.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.402
<i>That was between my
brother and his wife.</i>

38:25.404 --> 38:26.503
<i>It's none of my business.</i>

38:26.505 --> 38:28.338
Oh my God.
You're so full of shit.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.172
<i>It's the truth.</i>

38:29.174 --> 38:30.674
No, you're just a coward.

38:33.378 --> 38:34.778
Apologize for that.

38:35.047 --> 38:35.945
<i>No.</i>

38:35.947 --> 38:39.349
No, you looked the other way
'cause he was your meal ticket.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.685
And that is fucking pathetic.

38:42.587 --> 38:43.253
Is it?

38:43.255 --> 38:44.454
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:45.390 --> 38:47.590
Look at me, Jimmy.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.559
Grade ten education.
No job skills.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.960
What was
I supposed to do?

38:50.962 --> 38:53.830
I'm on fuckin' welfare the last
eight years 'cause of you.

38:53.832 --> 38:54.597
<i>Because of me?</i>

38:55.200 --> 38:56.399
Don't put that shit on me.

38:56.401 --> 38:58.335
If you'd done something,
I wouldn't have had to.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.235
<i>I tried.</i>

38:59.705 --> 39:00.970
Hand 'a God.
I tried.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.907
I asked her if she wanted to
do something about it.

39:03.909 --> 39:04.874
And she said no.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.777
<i>Said she couldn't
live without him.</i>

39:07.779 --> 39:14.150
<i>And when you had him locked
up, she wasn't the same.</i>

39:15.153 --> 39:16.920
I'm sure she wasn't
any happier.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.760
My brother has his flaws.
I know that.

39:25.497 --> 39:30.467
<i>If you'd seen our father,
maybe you wouldn't think yours was so bad.</i>

39:30.469 --> 39:31.868
I doubt that.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.606
<i>Listen, Gus probably
got what he deserved.</i>

39:37.642 --> 39:40.343
I'm not mad at ya. And
know you had your reasons.

39:40.345 --> 39:43.546
But Danny didn't do
anything to you.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.883
And his situation
right now...

39:47.519 --> 39:49.152
That's on you.

39:49.154 --> 39:52.188
You putting Gus away set this
whole thing in motion.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.326
You fucked everyone's life up.

39:56.328 --> 39:58.094
And walked away.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.166
<i>You don't have to do
it the way we would.</i>

40:03.168 --> 40:04.467
<i>Use the cops.
I don't care.</i>

40:04.469 --> 40:06.469
<i>Just fuckin'
take care of it.</i>

40:06.471 --> 40:09.072
<i>I don't wanna go
to another funeral.</i>

40:17.849 --> 40:18.648
Okay.

40:24.423 --> 40:25.555
Good.

40:26.391 --> 40:27.857
Shake on it.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.130
I love you, Jimmy.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.567
I know what it's like.
I know it's tough.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.869
You did the best you could.

40:41.106 --> 40:45.608
I'll leave you alone now, to do
your chores like a good boy.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.782
When a man can make something
like that for his wife-

40:52.784 --> 40:55.819
You'll be forgiven,
more often than not.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.456
I can't draw a fuckin' stick
man. And he can do that.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.025
It don't make sense.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.027
Can you draw?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.330
Yeah, I paint.

41:07.332 --> 41:08.331
Do ya?

41:08.333 --> 41:09.599
Yeah.

41:09.968 --> 41:10.934
Good for you.

41:10.936 --> 41:13.102
Maybe I'll let you
paint me nude sometime.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.571
Jesus Christ.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.139
There's a smile.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.907
About fuckin' time.

41:18.443 --> 41:19.809
I'll be talking to ya.

41:46.705 --> 41:47.704
<i>Wake up!</i>

41:47.706 --> 41:48.638
Wha?

41:48.640 --> 41:49.472
<i>Get up!</i>

41:49.474 --> 41:51.007
<i>Right now!</i>

41:51.576 --> 41:53.109
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

41:54.045 --> 41:56.479
I can explain. That
is what I had to-

41:56.481 --> 41:57.580
<i>Where did you get them?</i>

41:57.582 --> 41:59.115
Jesus!
Can I talk?

42:00.285 --> 42:01.584
I can fuckin' explain.

42:01.586 --> 42:02.986
<i>I'm listening.
I'm listening!</i>

42:13.498 --> 42:15.765
I lost my job at the warehouse.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.601
<i>What?
When?</i>

42:18.603 --> 42:21.838
Just before Rose died.
Two days before.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.673
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

42:23.675 --> 42:25.141
<i>Jesus, when were you
gonna tell me?</i>

42:25.143 --> 42:27.610
I was trying to figure
out what to say, Jess.

42:27.612 --> 42:30.813
And, bang, she was dead.
And everything was fucked.

42:30.815 --> 42:33.550
I still had to pay rent
and feed the family.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.318
That's-

42:35.320 --> 42:38.154
<i>You swore to me you would
never do this shit again!</i>

42:38.156 --> 42:39.889
You swore.

42:40.458 --> 42:41.558
I know.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.792
I was desperate.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.294
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

42:44.296 --> 42:45.528
You didn't know what to do.

42:45.530 --> 42:47.030
You coulda tried
talking to me, Danny.

42:47.032 --> 42:48.831
It's supposed to be
a fucking marriage.

42:48.833 --> 42:49.933
We're supposed to
help each other.

42:50.869 --> 42:52.735
I am helping you.
And the kids!

42:52.737 --> 42:55.038
That's why I did this!

42:58.143 --> 42:59.075
I dunno.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.077
<i>You don't know what?</i>

43:01.079 --> 43:03.146
<i>You don't know if I
love this family?</i>

43:05.383 --> 43:07.083
How did you lose your job?

43:07.519 --> 43:08.985
<i>What?</i>

43:09.721 --> 43:11.921
It's a simple question.

43:13.158 --> 43:16.292
They're downsizing and a
couple of people got let go.

43:17.395 --> 43:19.095
<i>So you got laid off.</i>

43:19.097 --> 43:20.196
Yes.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.834
<i>Because there should be some
kind of severance package, Danny.</i>

43:24.836 --> 43:25.902
<i>There should be money!</i>

43:25.904 --> 43:27.403
<i>You shouldn't have
to do this!</i>

43:29.941 --> 43:31.174
Well, I didn't get any.

43:31.176 --> 43:34.110
I don't know what you
want me to tell ya.

43:38.783 --> 43:39.816
Are you using again?

43:39.818 --> 43:42.318
Aw, Jesus Jess.
Come on!

43:42.320 --> 43:44.120
Of course not.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.689
This is just to bridge the gap
between jobs. That's it.

43:46.691 --> 43:47.790
I'm gonna get another job.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.859
I'm asking around. Okay?

43:53.365 --> 43:57.300
<i>I can't.
I can't do this!</i>

43:57.302 --> 43:58.368
You can't do what?

43:58.370 --> 43:59.836
<i>This!</i>

43:59.838 --> 44:02.839
I'm not doing this again,
Danny. Not with kids!

44:03.742 --> 44:06.175
We live on a fucking island.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.945
Where are you gonna go if the
cops come looking for you?

44:08.947 --> 44:11.381
You gonna jump in the ocean
and start swimming?

44:12.817 --> 44:14.984
<i>It's beyond stupid.</i>

44:17.188 --> 44:18.087
Jess.

44:20.558 --> 44:22.025
Jess, look at me.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.193
Jess!

44:25.196 --> 44:27.997
You're right, okay?
You're right.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.166
Come here.

44:30.502 --> 44:31.834
Come here.

44:32.637 --> 44:34.237
I only robbed one store.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.038
Oh!

44:35.674 --> 44:37.440
No one saw me.
That's it.

44:37.442 --> 44:40.309
And I'm not gonna do it again.
And that's the truth.

44:40.311 --> 44:41.444
Okay?

44:42.647 --> 44:43.379
I fucked up.

44:43.381 --> 44:44.080
Mm hmm.

44:44.082 --> 44:45.214
I'm sorry.

44:45.617 --> 44:47.417
You're right.

44:50.922 --> 44:53.589
Listen to me now.

44:56.127 --> 44:59.495
I will kill for this
family if I had to.

45:01.933 --> 45:04.333
You guys are everything to me.

45:30.795 --> 45:31.561
Mikey!

45:32.564 --> 45:34.197
Ten shots of tequila,
por favour!

47:07.559 --> 47:08.491
<i>Wow.</i>

47:09.494 --> 47:11.394
Looking pretty good in
those glasses, old man.

47:12.497 --> 47:13.663
Do you wanna fuck at
my house, or yours?

47:14.833 --> 47:16.999
<i>Jesus Christ. You are
sick, you know that?</i>

47:17.001 --> 47:19.101
I take that to mean I
won that exchange?

47:19.103 --> 47:21.170
<i>Nobody wins that
exchange, John.</i>

47:21.573 --> 47:22.438
How you doing?

47:22.440 --> 47:23.389
Alright.

47:23.390 --> 47:24.339
Are things settling
down a bit?

47:24.342 --> 47:25.642
Not really.

47:25.643 --> 47:26.943
I'm up at the house.
Gotta deal with that mess.

47:26.945 --> 47:28.411
Gotta sell it, you know.

47:28.413 --> 47:31.447
Yeah, right. Do you wanna sit
down, or is this gonna be quick?

47:31.449 --> 47:32.315
I'll sit.

47:33.251 --> 47:34.684
Good, because my right
foot is killing me.

47:34.686 --> 47:36.085
I think I got the gout.

47:37.922 --> 47:38.638
You are old,
aren't you?

47:38.639 --> 47:39.355
It afflicts many a
young man too, Jimmy.

47:40.658 --> 47:43.059
Oh, before I sit down. Do
you wanna drink or anything?

47:43.061 --> 47:46.462
Like maybe a rum, or beer,
whisky sour, glass of wine?

47:46.464 --> 47:48.397
When are you gonna
quit with that shit?

47:48.399 --> 47:51.100
When you start drinking and
smoking like a normal human being.

47:51.102 --> 47:52.635
Not gonna happen.

47:52.637 --> 47:54.036
Okay,
o what brings you here?

47:54.739 --> 47:56.405
I wanna solve the drug problem.

47:56.908 --> 47:58.441
<i>Holy Fuck.</i>

47:59.677 --> 48:00.977
God bless your optimism, but...

48:00.979 --> 48:02.812
Nobody's gonna solve that.

48:02.814 --> 48:03.713
Not even you.

48:04.449 --> 48:05.581
<i>Not the whole thing.</i>

48:05.984 --> 48:07.216
Just one part.

48:07.652 --> 48:08.651
Danny's part.

48:09.654 --> 48:11.187
<i>Ah, I see.</i>

48:12.824 --> 48:16.025
I figure I've been fighting all his
fights since we were little kids.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.527
<i>Why stop now?</i>

48:18.529 --> 48:19.996
So how much do you know?

48:19.998 --> 48:21.230
<i>Nothing really.</i>

48:21.232 --> 48:23.199
Just that he's in with
some pretty bad people.

48:23.201 --> 48:24.867
<i>Do you know what they are?</i>

48:24.869 --> 48:26.235
No. Do you?

48:26.838 --> 48:28.604
Oh yeah. I do.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.973
And I know that they've
bought the King's Crown.

48:30.975 --> 48:32.575
And they're operating out of it.

48:32.577 --> 48:36.078
Okay, so raid the
place and build a case.

48:36.481 --> 48:37.380
<i>We tried that.</i>

48:37.782 --> 48:38.981
They were clean.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.050
Made me look like
a fuckin' idiot.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.419
And they fuckin' knew it, too.

48:43.421 --> 48:48.357
Oh, the smug look they
gave me during that raid.

48:49.027 --> 48:52.561
<i>It was... Holy fuck.</i>

48:53.264 --> 48:55.531
<i>You woulda lost it,
Jimmy.</i>

48:55.533 --> 48:56.666
<i>Believe me.</i>

48:59.070 --> 49:01.771
So, what can I do?

49:02.607 --> 49:03.339
<i>You know me.</i>

49:03.975 --> 49:06.142
I say meet force with force.

49:06.144 --> 49:09.078
But this place has gone soft.

49:09.981 --> 49:11.147
It's embarrassing.

49:11.983 --> 49:14.083
I coulda used you
during that raid.

49:15.286 --> 49:18.821
<i>No one here is made of the same
stuff as you and me, Jimmy.</i>

49:20.959 --> 49:22.658
Maybe Toronto made me soft too.

49:23.528 --> 49:27.096
<i>Ah. You're still a bulldog.</i>

49:27.098 --> 49:28.397
<i>I can see it in your eyes.</i>

49:29.634 --> 49:31.834
<i>Christ, I wish you were
on that raid with me.</i>

49:33.104 --> 49:37.440
That smile. That fuckin'
smile he gave me.

49:38.743 --> 49:41.610
I wanted to see you just knock
it right off his face.

49:42.914 --> 49:49.485
You know-you give me and you ten
minutes alone with these guys-

49:50.722 --> 49:53.122
<i>And they won't be a
problem any more.</i>

49:55.126 --> 49:57.326
I'm trying not to do
that anymore, John.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.429
That's a shame.

50:00.431 --> 50:01.530
What happened?

50:02.266 --> 50:04.233
Too many suspensions.

50:04.902 --> 50:08.137
It just doesn't fly up there.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.807
Some people just never
understand.

50:13.011 --> 50:17.313
In the real world, the ends
justify the means.

50:18.649 --> 50:19.715
Yeah.

50:23.454 --> 50:25.755
So what do you know
about this Danny thing?

50:26.124 --> 50:27.590
<i>Not much.</i>

50:27.592 --> 50:31.060
<i>I know he's in way over
his head with these guys.</i>

50:31.062 --> 50:32.361
<i>Come to think of it-</i>

50:32.363 --> 50:34.797
<i>I wouldn't be surprised if they
knew who you were.</i>

50:36.100 --> 50:39.268
They don't strike me as they
type to leave loose ends.

50:40.004 --> 50:40.736
Hey.

50:42.273 --> 50:44.173
Did you bring a piece?

50:44.609 --> 50:45.741
No.

50:46.778 --> 50:48.411
<i>Fuck.</i>

50:49.414 --> 50:51.781
Fuck.
Hey. Follow me.

50:52.984 --> 50:54.683
Christ! Fucking foot.

50:55.053 --> 50:57.220
You alright?

50:57.221 --> 50:59.388
Yeah, I'm fine.
Get my coat, will ya?

51:10.535 --> 51:11.400
Here.

51:13.471 --> 51:14.303
Take it.

51:15.973 --> 51:16.772
What's this?

51:16.774 --> 51:19.775
I don't want anything bad
happening to you.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.377
Take it.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.880
Okay. Well, what
happens if I gotta use it?

51:24.882 --> 51:26.482
Nuthin.

51:27.885 --> 51:30.519
Listen.
Maybe you don't need it.

51:30.521 --> 51:33.389
Maybe when you talk to Danny you
can work this whole thing out.

51:33.391 --> 51:38.427
But I don't wanna risk a situation
where you need it and you don't got it.

51:38.830 --> 51:40.729
Just take it.

52:00.751 --> 52:01.584
<i>No thanks.</i>

52:02.620 --> 52:03.552
Suit yourself.

52:22.840 --> 52:24.940
Jesus, Val!

52:25.877 --> 52:28.377
You are one smart
mother fucker.

52:29.981 --> 52:31.413
I can barely use a computer.

52:31.415 --> 52:33.716
And your over here building
fuckin' robots or something.

52:34.685 --> 52:37.052
<i>I dunno.
I'm not that smart.</i>

52:37.054 --> 52:38.888
<i>It's just the way my
brain works.</i>

52:38.890 --> 52:43.159
Yeah, well, my brain's
broken next to yours.

52:43.161 --> 52:45.961
That's why me make
such a good team.

52:46.898 --> 52:47.863
Brains.

52:48.599 --> 52:49.465
Charm.

52:50.067 --> 52:51.300
Like that song.

52:51.569 --> 52:52.268
<i>What song?</i>

52:52.270 --> 52:53.702
You know that song.

52:54.138 --> 52:57.173
♪ You got the brains.
I got the looks. ♪

52:57.175 --> 52:58.407

53:28.172 --> 53:30.439
You don't even know.

53:33.144 --> 53:34.410
Don't get a family, Val.

53:34.412 --> 53:35.144
You're smart.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.913
Stay smart

53:38.749 --> 53:40.649
♪ Money money money ♪

53:44.689 --> 53:46.855
They fucking take it all.

53:46.857 --> 53:48.991

53:48.993 --> 53:50.626
Feeding four people.

53:51.362 --> 53:52.494
Holy Christ, man.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.731
You'd be shocked at
home much that cost.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.500
<i>You know what I was
thinking about the other day?</i>

53:59.937 --> 54:02.271
I was thinking about
that movie, Casino.

54:02.273 --> 54:03.105
<i>Sharon Stone.</i>

54:03.107 --> 54:03.772
Yeah.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.140
<i>Good movie.</i>

54:05.142 --> 54:06.742
That was a great
fuckin' movie.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.377
I was thinking
about that scene

54:08.379 --> 54:12.114
when the slot machine gets
hacked, or whatever.

54:12.116 --> 54:13.882
And DeNiro yells at
the cowboy guy.

54:13.884 --> 54:14.583
<i>Right.</i>

54:14.585 --> 54:15.751
Do your remember that?

54:15.753 --> 54:17.152
<i>Yeah.</i>

54:18.623 --> 54:19.355
<i>Fuck.</i>

54:22.159 --> 54:23.292
<i>He's all like:</i>

54:23.294 --> 54:24.526
<i>Either you're too
stupid to see it.</i>

54:24.528 --> 54:26.362
<i>Or you were in on it.</i>

54:26.364 --> 54:28.197
Either way, you
can't be trusted.

54:28.199 --> 54:30.899
<i>I'm firing you.</i>

54:30.901 --> 54:33.369
<i>I'm fuckin firing you.</i>

54:33.371 --> 54:34.370
I'm firing you!

54:34.372 --> 54:36.238
<i>I'm firing you.</i>

54:36.240 --> 54:38.874
<i>Get outta here!
Get outta here!</i>

54:39.844 --> 54:41.877
That movie's based on
a true story, right?

54:41.879 --> 54:43.512
Yeah, I think so.

54:46.550 --> 54:49.151
Is that something that
could be done in really life?

54:50.388 --> 54:51.420
With a slot machine?

54:51.422 --> 54:53.689
<i>Yeah, like a VLT machine.</i>

54:53.691 --> 54:54.456
Probably.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.726
<i>Could you do it?</i>

54:58.896 --> 55:01.897
Uh, I'd have to get one to open
it up and see how it works.

55:01.899 --> 55:05.901
But, yeah, probably. I
probably could figure it out.

55:09.340 --> 55:10.706
Do you wanna do it?

55:12.376 --> 55:13.108
<i>Are you serious?</i>

55:13.110 --> 55:17.112
Yeah, if I can get you one.
Do you wanna do it?

55:21.752 --> 55:22.518
Sure.

55:23.354 --> 55:24.520
Sure!

55:25.089 --> 55:26.955
<i>Sure! Yes!</i>

55:27.725 --> 55:28.724
Yes!

55:28.726 --> 55:29.458
Yes!

55:29.460 --> 55:31.894
Fuckin' love it!
You crazy fucker.

55:42.973 --> 55:44.840
<i>So how can get get one?</i>

55:46.277 --> 55:47.176
Easy.

55:49.814 --> 55:50.879
We just take it.

56:08.733 --> 56:11.233
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

56:15.773 --> 56:18.607
Sorry, I was off in
another world, totally.

56:18.609 --> 56:22.478
And I was just like, what the
fuck is touching me, and-

56:22.480 --> 56:24.947
Is it okay that I'm here?

56:24.949 --> 56:27.216
Of course. It's-

56:27.218 --> 56:29.518
I'm sorry.
I didn't call.

56:29.520 --> 56:32.154
I just was out, and...

56:32.156 --> 56:34.189
It's really good to see you.

56:34.191 --> 56:35.224
Yeah?

56:35.226 --> 56:36.892
Yeah. Hi.

56:36.894 --> 56:37.860
Hi,

56:39.096 --> 56:41.096
I thought of you and...

56:42.066 --> 56:46.668
Here I am.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.138
Here you are.

56:52.576 --> 56:56.845
Wow, it's exactly
the same in here.

56:56.847 --> 56:59.581
I know.
It's crazy. Right?

57:01.719 --> 57:04.286
She wouldn't let anybody
in here, you know.

57:04.288 --> 57:05.721
Really?

57:05.723 --> 57:11.727
Not me. Not the kids.
That door was always closed.

57:11.729 --> 57:14.763
And it was off limits.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.807
Can we talk somewhere else?

57:26.210 --> 57:30.279
Too weird being in the same room
we used to have sex in.

57:36.754 --> 57:39.888
Um. So... what's new?

57:39.890 --> 57:41.790
You still at the nursing home?

57:41.792 --> 57:42.991
Yeah.

57:42.993 --> 57:43.826
Yeah?

57:43.828 --> 57:44.760
Part time.

57:45.696 --> 57:48.230
Might have to go to
full time. We'll see.

57:50.234 --> 57:53.869
I keep expecting her to come
in here an make me some tea.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.606
Yeah.

58:01.412 --> 58:03.212
Do you want some of her bread?

58:04.615 --> 58:05.881
Is that possible?

58:05.883 --> 58:09.451
Yes. I can make you toast
and butter right now.

58:09.453 --> 58:10.419
Are you in?

58:10.421 --> 58:11.753
Absolutely.

58:21.499 --> 58:22.231
<i>Mmmm?</i>

58:22.666 --> 58:23.398
Mmmm.

58:28.038 --> 58:28.904
Wow.

58:34.812 --> 58:36.211
Shit,
that's good.

58:36.580 --> 58:37.379
<i>I know.</i>

58:38.516 --> 58:41.683
I had a piece, but I
couldn't eat anymore.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.118
I don't know why.
I just-

58:43.120 --> 58:44.953
<i>didn't want it to
be all gone.</i>

58:44.955 --> 58:46.121
<i>Or something.</i>

58:46.123 --> 58:49.258
So, you're just gonna let it
go bad and not have any.

58:50.327 --> 58:52.561
I know it doesn't
make any sense at all.

58:52.563 --> 58:55.297
But I just can't eat it.

58:56.534 --> 58:57.966
So how's Toronto?

58:57.968 --> 58:59.768
<i>Fine.</i>

59:00.304 --> 59:01.570
Whereabouts do you live?

59:01.572 --> 59:02.704
<i>Cabbage Town.</i>

59:04.475 --> 59:05.374
Cabbage Town?

59:05.976 --> 59:07.209
<i>Cabbage Town.</i>

59:08.679 --> 59:10.746
Do you live in a farmer's
field or something?

59:10.748 --> 59:12.247
<i>Yeah, I live in
a farmer's field.</i>

59:12.249 --> 59:14.950
<i>No, it's just a neighborhood
near downtown Toronto.</i>

59:14.952 --> 59:16.151
<i>It's called Cabbage Town.</i>

59:18.422 --> 59:19.187
Is it nice?

59:19.189 --> 59:19.955
<i>Mm Hmm.</i>

59:20.658 --> 59:21.790
It's pretty nice.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.325
There's lots of different
kinds of food.

59:23.327 --> 59:25.227
And culture.

59:25.229 --> 59:30.032
And it's a lot more interesting
than this stale white place.

59:32.303 --> 59:33.802
So how long are you staying?

59:34.705 --> 59:36.605
<i>I don't know. I gotta
sell this place.</i>

59:36.607 --> 59:37.773
<i>I gotta sell the car.</i>

59:37.775 --> 59:39.408
<i>And, I dunno.</i>

59:39.410 --> 59:42.911
<i>I might just head back to
Toronto and do it all from there.</i>

59:42.913 --> 59:44.713
<i>I really don't know what
I'm gonna do yet.</i>

59:45.649 --> 59:47.816
You gotta girlfriend
you gotta get back to?

59:49.320 --> 59:52.421
No. No girlfriend.

59:53.657 --> 59:57.359
I... Actually, I haven't seen
anybody since you.

59:57.361 --> 59:58.760
If I'm perfectly honest.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.963
Holy shit, Jimmy.
Live a little.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:02.864
<i>I know.
I know, right?</i>

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:07.336
<i>Just really busy,
I guess.</i>

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:09.738
Yeah, but come on. Sixteen
years, no girlfriend?

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.407
Are you becoming a
monk or something?

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.576
<i>No. Definitely not.</i>

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:16.345
<i>Um. Just-</i>

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.914
<i>Busy with
work. Routine.</i>

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:22.918
You know, time just
kinda gets away from me.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.153
And you were such
a fuckin' nightmare-

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:27.823
That it kinda
turned me off women.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.694
That was supposed
to be a joke.

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:33.462
Jesus Christ,
Jimmy.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.763
Wow.

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.965
<i>No. I'm sorry. That
was supposed to be a joke.</i>

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.500
<i>It sounded okay
in my head.</i>

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:40.035
<i>But it sounded terrible-</i>

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:42.237
It's fine. You just said it like
you really meant it, is all.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:44.272
<i>I didn't. I'm really sorry.
It was stupid.</i>

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:47.075
<i>I didn't mean it at all.
It was a bad joke.</i>

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:47.743
Okay.

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:48.443
<i>Okay?</i>

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:49.878
Mmm hmm.

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:54.549
So how's Danny?

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:58.320
<i>I dunno.
Not good?</i>

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.622
He's drinking more and-

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:04.192
I'm pretty sure
he's using again.

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:06.328
So there's that.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.931
<i>You feel safe?</i>

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:12.300
What do you mean?

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:15.337
<i>I mean, do you feel like he'd
hurt you or the kids?</i>

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.005
No.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:21.476
No! He's not dangerous.
He's fucked up.

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:24.579
All that shit from
where he was a kid.

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:26.515
I mean,
I can't even imagine.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.651
<i>He's never hit me
or the kids.</i>

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.287
<i>I mean,
he's good to us.</i>

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:35.957
<i>I can tell
you don't believe me.</i>

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:37.159
Nah.

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:40.896
Just struggling to understand

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.165
how somebody could be a good
husband and father,

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:45.367
while drinking and doing drugs,
because my father did that.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.336
And he beat the shit out of
my mom right in front of me.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:50.205
<i>He's not your father.</i>

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.173
Same gene pool.

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:53.575
You got them genes too,
and look at you.

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:54.876
I mean,
you're straight.

01:01:55.646 --> 01:01:57.212
You're a cop,
for Christ sake.

01:01:58.115 --> 01:02:00.082
<i>Genes don't make
someone who they are.</i>

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:03.251
If you say so.

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.020
<i>It's bad.</i>

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:07.889
I'm not saying he's
not hard to be with.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.391
It's just not dangerous bad.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:15.097
I'd be lying if I said I didn't
think about leaving him once a month.

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:16.932
Sometimes once a week.

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:23.205
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like
to take the kids and come live with you.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.579
Sorry I said.

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:35.317
Forget I said that.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:38.487
<i>Jimmy.</i>

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.388
<i>Say something.</i>

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:44.459
I'm just struggling to
understand why you'd think that.

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:47.329
Because I remember what you
said to me when we broke up.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:50.966
You said it was because I was
too much like my father.

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:53.602
Am I imagining that?
Is that what you said?

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:54.336
<i>Jimmy don't.</i>

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:55.270
Did you say that?

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:58.307
Yeah?

01:02:58.308 --> 01:02:59.074
So, why would you
want me back?

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:01.042
Just doesn't make
any fucking sense!

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.712
Which is it? Am I like
my father or am not?

01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:05.046
<i>You're not your father.</i>

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:07.415
Then why did you choose
Danny over me?

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.286
<i>Because I never thought
he was gonna hurt me.</i>

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.388
<i>And I can't say the
same about you.</i>

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:18.560
Okay.

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:23.965
Okay.
I'd like you to leave now.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.433
<i>You brought it up.</i>

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.236
I'd like you to leave now.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:37.212
Just get the fuck out,
right now.

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.591
<i>Thanks for the toast.</i>

01:04:16.587 --> 01:04:17.986
Oof!

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:20.622
<i>Don't fuckin' move
and don't make a sound!</i>

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.057
I can't hear you!
Head phones!

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:23.124
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:26.761
<i>I said don't move and
don't make a fuckin' sound.</i>

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:29.231
<i>Just nod or shake
your head. Got it?</i>

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.633
<i>Is there anyone left
in the pub?</i>

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:34.536
<i>Do you have a key to
the back door?</i>

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.338
<i>Is there an alarm system?</i>

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:39.908
<i>Do you know the
code to turn it off?</i>

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.243
<i>Good. Now, here's
what's gonna happen.</i>

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.144
<i>We're gonna walk right
through that back door.</i>

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:44.679
<i>You're gonna keep looking
straight ahead.</i>

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.214
<i>If you turn to look at me.</i>

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.515
<i>If you try to fuckin' run.</i>

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:49.951
<i>If you make a sound. I'm
gonna fuckin' kill you.</i>

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:51.186
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:52.787
<i>Good. Now let's go.</i>

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.225
<i>Look straight ahead.</i>

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.294
<i>And don't you fuckin' look
at me, you understand?</i>

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:00.495
That's it.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:02.864
That's right.

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:04.065
This way.

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:07.202
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.338
That's right.
Straight ahead.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.475
Atta boy.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:15.644
Up these fuckin' stairs.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.617
Now.

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.486
Don't you be stupid, okay?

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.588
Don't you be stupid.

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:31.159
<i>Whoo! Whoo!</i>

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.172
Now.

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:48.076
Stay right there.

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:50.312
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

01:05:50.314 --> 01:05:51.813
Don't you fuckin' move.

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.782
Now. I want you to
open that door.

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:56.117
And go straight to the alarm.
Go!

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:00.922
Don't fuck up.

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:02.490
Don't Don't!

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.326
Val. Get the keys.

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:05.860
Give 'em to him.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.164
Try it again. Don't
be fuckin' stupid.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.837
Go. Right to the alarm.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.806
Go, go, go.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.320
<i>Val, turn that
fuckin' light off.</i>

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:40.128
<i>Over here.</i>

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.429
<i>Now you fuckin' stand
right here.</i>

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:44.199
<i>And don't you fuckin' move.</i>

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.769
<i>You know there's
not much money in those.</i>

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:48.436
<i>Just coins.</i>

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:50.622
Ugh!

01:06:50.623 --> 01:06:51.973
<i>I told you not to make a
fuckin' sound, didn't I?</i>

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:53.641
<i>Don't touch it.
Let it bleed.</i>

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:56.211
<i>Come on, Val.</i>

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:58.146
<i>Fuck, give me a hand.
It's too heavy.</i>

01:06:58.148 --> 01:06:59.280
<i>Help him.</i>

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:00.515
<i>Just fuckin' help him!</i>

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.384
<i>Just help me
tip it off the wall</i>

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:04.552
<i>so we can put
it on the dolly.</i>

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.821
<i>Come on!</i>

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.656
<i>- What the fuck?</i>

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:09.858
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:12.093
<i>- Fuck!</i>

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:13.828
<i>- Val! Turn that
fuckin' light off.</i>

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.063
<i>- It's fuckin' connected.</i>

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:15.897
<i>- What?</i>

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:18.366
<i>- It's fuckin' connected.</i>

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.167
<i>Look.</i>

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.602
<i>- Turn the fuckin' light off.</i>

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:24.672
<i>You got a bolt
cutter in the van?</i>

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:27.075
- I got one at home.
I could go get it.

01:07:27.077 --> 01:07:27.742
<i>- Goddamn it!</i>

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.844
<i>Mother fucker!</i>

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.614
<i>Uh. Hey! Hey!</i>

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:33.815
<i>Fuckin's stay here!</i>

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:34.949
Hey!

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:58.406
<i>Hey!</i>

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:34.736
Hey.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.038
Is Danny here?

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:40.475
<i>No.</i>

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.645
<i>Is that all?</i>

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.984
Look. I realize I can be
really hard to be around-

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:56.291
Most of the time. And I
just need you to know-

01:09:56.293 --> 01:10:00.929
That I would never hurt you.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:06.534
And I'm really sorry
about being rude to you.

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:17.579
Okay.

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.386
Jimmy, wait.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.960
Danny didn't come
home last night.

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:56.851
Fuck!

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:04.792
Okay. Okay.

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:08.396
Whooa!

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:24.679
Hey! Fuck Face. Put all the Lotto
cards and the cash in a bag now!

01:11:24.681 --> 01:11:27.081
Before I blow a hole in
your fat fuckin' gut!

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:27.882
Do it!

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:28.583
<i>Oh my God!</i>

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:29.851
On the ground, now!

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:31.152
On the fuckin' ground!

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:32.186
Faster, you old fuck!

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:33.755
Faster! Faster!

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:36.224
Shut up!
I"m not gonna hurt you!

01:11:36.226 --> 01:11:37.325
What the fuck?

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:39.694
Fuck you,
you little prick!

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:43.264
<i>That's it!
Run!</i>

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:44.732
<i>Run!
Ya little prick!</i>

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:53.741
So, what did you tell
Travis and Sarah?

01:11:57.013 --> 01:11:59.047
That he was sick in bed.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:04.585
They're gonna be
home from school soon.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.821
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.725
You'll figure something out.

01:12:10.727 --> 01:12:12.193
It's okay.

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.852
What the fuck is this?

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.520
<i>Where
the hell were you?</i>

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:40.221
Out.

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:41.222
<i>You couldn't call me?</i>

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:42.423
What the fuck
is he doing here?

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:43.891
What did you
do to your hands?

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.727
Nothing! What the fuck
is he doing here?

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:47.929
<i>I'm sitting right here.
You can talk to me.</i>

01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:49.630
What the fuck are you
doing here?

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:51.466
<i>I came, actually,
to talk to you.</i>

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:52.367
<i>You weren't here.</i>

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:54.135
<i>She let me in to wait with her.</i>

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:55.970
You couldn't wait alone?

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:57.004
No, I couldn't.

01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:59.607
I thought you were dead!

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:03.144
Bullshit. What, did he
spend the night?

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:04.479
Did you fuck him in my bed?

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:06.030
<i>Danny.</i>

01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:06.913
<i>There's nothing going on.</i>

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:07.915
Yeah, well there's
something going on.

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:09.417
'Cause you're in
my fuckin' house.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.452
And I don't want you in
my fucking house!

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:12.220
<i>Alright.</i>

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:13.588
I'll leave.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:14.522
<i>No.</i>

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.691
<i>No, you stay.</i>

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:19.160
Okay. He's here
because you weren't.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.729
I was out there trying to
provide for this family.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.164
Oh.
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:26.267
If you want to provide for this
family, get a fucking job.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:29.303
Good luck with that, now that
you broke your fucking hand.

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:30.138
Baby, listen.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.756
Don't.

01:13:31.757 --> 01:13:33.373
Do you have any idea how close
I am to taking the kids-

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:34.742
And leaving here?

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.043
Do you?

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:38.279
What, are you gonna run
off with this prick?

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:39.180
Maybe.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.549
Maybe not. It
really doesn't matter.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.084
It matters.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:44.485
No it doesn't. You should be
worried about losing your family.

01:13:44.487 --> 01:13:47.054
Not who I'm going to
fuck when I leave here.

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:49.924
Jess. I don't know what you
think is going on, but -

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.959
You're on fucking drugs!
That's what going on.

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:53.628
<i>We just wanna help you.</i>

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.329
Don't you fucking talk to me!

01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:57.765
<i>Doug told me all about what
was going on, Danny.</i>

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.267
What the fuck does he know?

01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:00.535
What?

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:01.803
<i>He knows that you're in
way over your head.</i>

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.671
He knows that you're doing
some really bad things

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.139
with some really bad people.

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:06.073
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:07.542
Here we go.

01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:08.776
Bad, bad. Bad.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.078
Jimmy Power and his fuckin'
moral judgements.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.114
<i>No judgements here, man.</i>

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.849
Yeah, right. Look at ya.

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:17.518
You look like you wanna
fuckin' puke right now.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.353
Oh poor Danny.
He needs me.

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:22.657
I don't need you to help me.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.891
I don't need you to save me.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:27.728
What makes you so much
better than me, Jimmy?

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:28.396
Huh?

01:14:28.398 --> 01:14:29.964
What is it?

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:34.469
I raised a family
with this woman.

01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:37.605
<i>It's a lot harder than anything
you've ever fuckin' done.</i>

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.442
Look. I know you got your
problems, Danny.

01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:43.077
And I'm just trying-

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:43.744
<i>Oh God!</i>

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:44.846
<i>Yeah here it is.</i>

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.481
Everything is because
of my problems.

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:48.683
Because I got fuckin' molested.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.718
<i>Yeah. Pretty much.</i>

01:14:58.428 --> 01:15:00.828
Am I wrong?

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:01.896
Fuck you.

01:15:02.265 --> 01:15:03.364
Hey. Danny.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.500
No. No.

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:06.834
Fuck you.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:07.969
Fuck you!

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:10.404
Fuck you, Jimmy!

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:12.573
You wanna talk about problems?

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:16.410
Let's talk about some
fuckin' problems.

01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:20.281
What's punching a hole in the wall
next to this girl's fuckin' head, huh?

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:21.649
Is that fuckin' normal?

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:24.151
Is that fuckin' normal?

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:28.289
Just because you don't drink,
doesn't make you a good person.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.691
Ever look in the mirror, huh?

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.260
See Gus staring back at you?

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:34.495
<i>You better watch yourself,
Danny.</i>

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.797
Actually, you know,
I take that back.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.034
<i>Your father's a better
man than you'll ever be.</i>

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:44.038
Are you that fucked up that you
can't see Gus for who he is-

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.673
Because of what he did for you?

01:15:46.376 --> 01:15:48.543
<i>Is that what's going on there?</i>

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:51.212
At least he fuckin' believed me.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.481
No one else did.

01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:55.416
You sure as fuck didn't.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:59.120
When I told Mom that he
made me suck his dick-

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:02.456
she slapped me for lying and made
me go back and see him again.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:04.392
And as soon as Gus found out-

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:05.993
He took care of it.

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.628
He put a fuckin' stop to it-

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:10.398
so it can never happen
to another kid again.

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:12.466
And what did you do?

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:14.802
<i>You waited.
And you waited.</i>

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.904
<i>Until you could find
someone to help you.</i>

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.472
<i>And then you did it.</i>

01:16:19.876 --> 01:16:21.876
You put him in jail for it.

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:24.745
Your own fuckin' father.

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:29.884
Life in prison.
For killing a priest.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.488
A twisted,
soulless fuck of a priest.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.193
But that didn't matter, right?

01:16:40.897 --> 01:16:43.731
Because you had evidence.
And you had Woods.

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:46.233
<i>You have no idea what it was
like to live with him.</i>

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.869
You have no fucking idea.

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:51.806
<i>You ripped her heart out.
You know that, right? Rose.</i>

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:53.641
<i>You ripped her
fucking heart out.</i>

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:54.675
<i>That's enough, Danny.</i>

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:56.811
Shut up, Danny.

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:58.212
<i>You pissed all over everything.</i>

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.581
<i>She was on fuckin'
welfare because of you.</i>

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:02.350
Shut up, Danny.

01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:08.623
I had to take money from my kids
and my family to help her.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:11.192
You weren't her son.
I was.

01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:12.326
Shut the fuck up, Danny!

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:13.327
I was her son.

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:14.428
Shut the fuck up, Danny!

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:15.463
I was her son.

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:16.597
Shut up!

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:18.332
And all she wanted was
to see you again.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:19.467
Shut up.

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:20.568
To touch your face.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:21.902
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:23.371
She asked about you every day.

01:17:23.373 --> 01:17:24.872
Shut the fuck up, Danny.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.107
Every day.

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:29.810
She asked about you
every fucking day.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.278
Shut the fuck up, Danny.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.881
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:35.416
Danny. That's enough.

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:37.385
Shit! They're home.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.786
Listen to me.

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.321
This stops right here.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.073
You here me?

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.824
I don't want them
a part of this.

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:54.635
So that's it now, right?

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:58.239
Just like that. You're gonna
run off to Toronto together.

01:17:58.241 --> 01:17:59.907
Is that it?

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:04.445
<i>That's alright.</i>

01:18:06.416 --> 01:18:08.149
It was hard to
fuck her anyway.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.186
Her cunt smelled like you.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.163
Stop it!

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.397
Uh!

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:31.338
<i>Stop it!</i>

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:39.613
<i>Don't you touch her!</i>

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.615
<i>Stay away from her!</i>

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:45.586
<i>Danny! Danny!</i>

01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:46.554
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:48.389
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.192
Jesus!

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:53.227
What is wrong with you?

01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:02.303
Baby! Please.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.074
Arggh!

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:17.638
Could you repeat that just
one more time, please?

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:19.840
<i>Um, which part?</i>

01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:21.108
All of it.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:28.249
I was coming down Prescott
Street to bring you your money.

01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:30.584
And someone jumped me.

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.486
And he hit me from behind.

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.922
He hit me in the back
of the head.

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:37.324
And he kicked me in the
face a couple of times.

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:40.027
And he took the money that
I was bringing to you.

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:42.029
<i>And I tried to get up
to see him.</i>

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.330
<i>But I didn't fuckin'
see anything.</i>

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.832
And that was yesterday,
was it?

01:21:44.834 --> 01:21:46.667
<i>Yes. Two-three o'clock.</i>

01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:49.803
Three o'clock. Fuck,
that's bad luck isn't it?

01:21:49.805 --> 01:21:51.505
Fuck me.
That's bad luck.

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:52.473
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:57.211
That's bad luck.

01:21:58.114 --> 01:21:59.847
Well, here's the thing.

01:21:59.849 --> 01:22:01.448
Well, two things really.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.485
One. It's really hard to
believe a coke head.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:07.855
I'm not saying your lying.
I'm just saying-

01:22:07.857 --> 01:22:09.156
I mean, obviously
something's happened.

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:10.824
Look at your fucking
face, right.

01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:12.359
But-

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:17.097
What exactly it is
that happened-

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:18.465
I don't know.

01:22:19.902 --> 01:22:23.470
Maybe you got stuck with your
hands in the cookie jar, did ya?

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:29.009
Maybe you deserved it.

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:30.511
I see you've got a broken arm.

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:33.414
<i>Did you get that in the
punch up, did ya?</i>

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:38.852
Charlie, man-

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:39.586
<i>Two.</i>

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:48.829
I don't understand what this
has to do with me at all.

01:22:49.865 --> 01:22:51.632
<i>Someone stole
your fuckin' money.</i>

01:22:52.868 --> 01:22:56.570
No. I would say someone
stole your fuckin' money.

01:22:56.906 --> 01:22:58.706
Allegedly.

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:00.841
Nobody took anything from me.

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:04.611
Except possible you, if you
don't fucking repay me.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:05.546
Right?

01:23:06.916 --> 01:23:08.182
<i>Charlie.
When have I ever</i>

01:23:08.184 --> 01:23:09.583
not fucking paid
you, man?

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:12.553
When have I ever
lied to you, huh?

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.191
You could lie to me
all fucking day long.

01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:19.259
I don't fucking know.
And I don't fucking care.

01:23:19.261 --> 01:23:21.862
Because you always fucking pay
me on time, don't you?

01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:30.671
Fuck. yeah.
That is a good song.

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:34.274
Es ist jenseits von Gut.

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:37.711
<i>Okay.
Just listen to me for a second.</i>

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:38.812
<i>I can get you -</i>

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:39.847
Shultz.

01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:40.981
I can get your money
for you, okay?

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:42.616
I don't have it now,
for obvious reasons.

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:45.019
But if you give me a couple
of more days-

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:46.620
Give me two or three
days tops, okay?

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:48.822
I can fucking get our
money for you Charlie.

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:49.857
I swear to God!

01:23:49.859 --> 01:23:51.291
This is no big deal.
I can fucking-

01:23:51.961 --> 01:23:52.693
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:54.328
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.272
I don't want to hear
your fucking voice anymore.

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:07.674
Do you understand? It's
really bothering me.

01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:08.976
<i>Charlie-</i>

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.277
See, there you go again,
talking!

01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:12.112
Da da da da da da.

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:16.784
I don't want to hear your
fucking voice!

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:27.528
Stick your tongue out.

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:31.365
Why?

01:24:32.001 --> 01:24:34.501
Because I'm gonna cut off.

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:39.506
Nothing crazy. Just a little
bit. You know what I mean.

01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:40.774
You'll still be able to talk.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:43.043
You just might have to
repeat yourself a lot.

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:45.312
But you'll find you
get used to it.

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:47.314
Listen. I have a son.
I have a son.

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:49.116
I don't fucking care
what you got.

01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:50.984
Stick that tongue out.

01:24:50.986 --> 01:24:53.387
Listen to me. You
don't understand.

01:24:53.389 --> 01:24:55.155
He can sell for you.
Okay.

01:24:55.157 --> 01:24:57.724
He's fifteen. He can get
into high schools.

01:24:57.726 --> 01:24:58.675
Into parties, anywhere.

01:24:58.676 --> 01:24:59.625
Stick your fucking tongue out-

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:02.362
or I'll cut through your
fucking cheek right now!

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:04.364
Just think about it,
please!

01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:06.233
Fuckin' think about it!
Think about it, Charlie!

01:25:06.235 --> 01:25:08.335
It's good business,
right?

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.237
It's good business. Just
think about it. Please.

01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:13.707
Please. Please. Just fuckin'
think about it.

01:25:16.879 --> 01:25:17.811
Alright.

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:20.380
Let him go.

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:22.583
Fuck!

01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:41.268
You wanna bring him
here tomorrow, right?

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:45.205
And if I like him, he's gonna
go to work for me.

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:47.274
And you've got three days
to pay me back.

01:25:47.276 --> 01:25:49.676
With interest. Okay?

01:25:52.348 --> 01:25:53.981
And if I don't like him-

01:25:56.085 --> 01:25:58.719
He's gonna watch
you get mutilated.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:05.592
Schultzy here is gonna hold him down
while I cut off your fucking hand.

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:08.896
Or maybe this foot.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.300
Maybe that ear, eh?

01:26:15.905 --> 01:26:18.005
Maybe these lips. Huh?

01:26:18.207 --> 01:26:18.939
Huh?

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:23.710
You understand, yeah?

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:25.412
Yeah.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.783
Good man.

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:36.924
Stand up, ya cunt.

01:26:47.937 --> 01:26:49.102
We got a fucking deal,
yeah?

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:49.836
Yeah.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:56.410
Ah!

01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:09.356
Get the fuck out of here.

01:28:49.792 --> 01:28:51.325
<i>Is the music too loud?</i>

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:52.659
'Cause I can turn it down.

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:55.862
Nah, that's good. Just pause
for a minute, will you?

01:29:04.106 --> 01:29:05.372
How's it going?

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.174
Good.

01:29:08.777 --> 01:29:10.210
How's your face?

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:12.946
It's nothing.

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:15.015
Can barely feel it.

01:29:15.651 --> 01:29:16.750
How's you neck?

01:29:16.752 --> 01:29:18.785
It's fine.

01:29:18.787 --> 01:29:20.654
That's good.

01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:25.092
So, what's up?

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:32.599
Have you ever done drugs?

01:29:33.369 --> 01:29:34.401
<i>Uh.</i>

01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:35.235
You're not in trouble
or anything.

01:29:35.237 --> 01:29:36.636
I'm just curious.

01:29:36.638 --> 01:29:37.671
<i>Feels like a trap.</i>

01:29:37.673 --> 01:29:40.107
It's not a trap.
Answer the question.

01:29:44.747 --> 01:29:46.880
<i>Smoked a bit of weed before.</i>

01:29:49.118 --> 01:29:50.217
<i>That's it.</i>

01:29:52.321 --> 01:29:53.186
<i>Why?</i>

01:29:55.524 --> 01:29:58.825
I smoked weed when I
was your age. And drank.

01:30:00.763 --> 01:30:04.297
I used to get all fucked up and
start acting like an asshole.

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:08.635
I was sloppy.
Don't be sloppy.

01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:11.772
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, okay.</i>

01:30:19.882 --> 01:30:22.682
I think I wanted
someone to hurt me.

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:24.418
You ever fell like that?

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:25.218
<i>No.</i>

01:30:28.424 --> 01:30:29.156
<i>Dad?</i>

01:30:32.227 --> 01:30:32.959
<i>Dad.</i>

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:41.902
Yeah. So, what I need
for you to do-

01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:43.303
Basically.

01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:47.974
Dad, spit it out already,
man.

01:30:56.318 --> 01:30:58.318
Never mind.

01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:00.320
<i>What?</i>

01:31:00.322 --> 01:31:02.222
Never mind. I'll
take care of it.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:03.890
<i>Alrighty.</i>

01:31:04.193 --> 01:31:04.958
Get up.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.659
<i>What?</i>

01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:06.726
Get up and give me a hug.

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:07.561
<i>Why?</i>

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:08.962
Get up and give me a hug!

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.347
<i>Why?</i>

01:31:10.348 --> 01:31:11.731
'Cause I'm your fucking father
and I want a hug, that's why.

01:31:11.733 --> 01:31:12.999
<i>Now get up here.</i>

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:19.973
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:31:25.547 --> 01:31:26.913
You're a good kid.

01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:27.647
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:31.151
Don't loose that,
alright?

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:32.252
Don't. Jesus!

01:31:32.254 --> 01:31:33.854
Alright, bye, Jesus.

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:34.955
Come on.

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.055
Can't a father love his son?

01:31:36.058 --> 01:31:37.191
<i>Sure.</i>

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:38.325
What's wrong with
admiring your face?

01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:39.826
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:44.397
<i>Just, please, please do
it from a distance next time.</i>

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:45.365
<i>Okay?</i>

01:31:45.367 --> 01:31:46.032
Yeah.

01:31:46.034 --> 01:31:46.766
<i>Please.</i>

01:31:47.436 --> 01:31:48.168
Alright.

01:31:50.539 --> 01:31:51.905
<i>See ya.</i>

01:38:12.554 --> 01:38:14.320
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

01:38:15.357 --> 01:38:17.123
<i>I've never seen
anything like that.</i>

01:38:17.492 --> 01:38:20.293
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

01:38:23.265 --> 01:38:23.997
<i>Hey.</i>

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.268
<i>You did good.
Don't worry.</i>

01:38:30.272 --> 01:38:32.605
<i>Everything's gonna be alright.</i>

01:38:33.141 --> 01:38:34.507
<i>They tried to run.</i>

01:38:35.443 --> 01:38:36.676
<i>You had no choice.</i>

01:38:39.114 --> 01:38:41.347
<i>You just got lucky
with a head shot.</i>

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:43.316
<i>Right?</i>

01:38:44.586 --> 01:38:46.119
<i>Does that sound okay?</i>

01:38:49.991 --> 01:38:51.457
<i>Hey Jimmy.</i>

01:38:53.128 --> 01:38:54.827
<i>Can you give me a nod,
or something?</i>

01:38:55.931 --> 01:38:58.598
<i>We gotta be on the same
page on this.</i>

01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:02.635
I had a choice, John.
I chose to kill them.

01:39:03.004 --> 01:39:04.704
You reacted!

01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:07.073
No.

01:39:10.245 --> 01:39:12.679
No.
They were unarmed.

01:39:13.481 --> 01:39:14.948
<i>Jesus, Jimmy.</i>

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:17.550
<i>You did the right thing there.</i>

01:39:17.552 --> 01:39:20.486
<i>They had it coming.</i>

01:39:20.488 --> 01:39:21.487
Yeah.

01:39:22.724 --> 01:39:26.426
I"m gonna need you the get
out of my car now, John.

01:39:27.329 --> 01:39:28.761
<i>Jimmy.</i>

01:39:28.763 --> 01:39:30.930
<i>Look, please don't worry.</i>

01:39:30.932 --> 01:39:34.534
<i>I'll handle the whole thing.</i>

01:39:37.739 --> 01:39:39.739
Please get the fuck out.

01:39:43.812 --> 01:39:45.478
Fuck off, Jimmy.

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:51.217
Get out.

01:40:48.743 --> 01:40:49.876
You look like shit.

01:40:50.512 --> 01:40:51.477
<i>Mmhmm.</i>

01:40:52.547 --> 01:40:54.380
<i>I like to think of
it as character.</i>

01:40:55.784 --> 01:41:00.319
<i>Good to get me some roles in
Hollywood, when I get outta here.</i>

01:41:00.321 --> 01:41:04.924
<i>See, they can't teach a
face like this, me b'y.</i>

01:41:06.428 --> 01:41:09.295
Is that what you're gonna do
if you don't die in here?

01:41:09.297 --> 01:41:10.897
Become a big movie star?

01:41:13.134 --> 01:41:14.700
<i>A man can dream.</i>

01:41:15.804 --> 01:41:19.472
<i>Last I checked.
Can't take that away.</i>

01:41:24.079 --> 01:41:27.380
You never know who
might be on the ship.

01:41:29.651 --> 01:41:32.585
You're grandfather
said that to me once.

01:41:34.055 --> 01:41:35.788
You remember him?

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:37.957
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.027
He used to tap dance.

01:41:41.029 --> 01:41:42.829
Did I ever tell you that?

01:41:43.098 --> 01:41:44.197
<i>No.</i>

01:41:44.199 --> 01:41:45.531
<i>But Mom did.</i>

01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:50.503
Yeah. Well he danced
up a fuckin' storm.

01:41:50.505 --> 01:41:54.807
'Til they put plastic
veins in his legs.

01:41:54.809 --> 01:41:57.610
Then he'd sit in a chair.

01:41:57.612 --> 01:42:00.680
And go through his
steps half time.

01:42:02.884 --> 01:42:03.816
Anyways.

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:09.322
I took him and your grandmother-

01:42:09.324 --> 01:42:13.793
down on a cruise
around Florida once.

01:42:13.795 --> 01:42:16.796
Now that would have been in-

01:42:18.366 --> 01:42:20.266
What year were you born?

01:42:20.835 --> 01:42:23.402
Nineteen seventy seven.

01:42:23.404 --> 01:42:26.472
<i>That was seventy six.</i>

01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:29.609
<i>You might have been
conceived on that cruise.</i>

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.446
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:42:33.448 --> 01:42:34.380
Anyways.

01:42:34.382 --> 01:42:36.449
He's unpacking
his suitcase,

01:42:36.451 --> 01:42:38.151
when I stopped
by with you mother-

01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:41.053
See if he wanted to go
out for a bite to eat.

01:42:41.055 --> 01:42:44.357
And he's pulling his
tap shoes out.

01:42:44.359 --> 01:42:47.793
I laughed and I said: Still
waiting for the big break,

01:42:47.795 --> 01:42:49.529
eh b'y?

01:42:49.531 --> 01:42:53.099
Crack! Smacked me
right across the face.

01:42:53.101 --> 01:42:54.901
Right in front of your mother.

01:42:54.903 --> 01:42:57.703
Right in front of my mother.

01:42:57.705 --> 01:42:58.971
Cut me.

01:42:58.973 --> 01:43:02.341
Above the eye with his ring.

01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:04.377
Anyway, he goes back
to unpacking.

01:43:04.379 --> 01:43:08.981
He said: You never know who
might be on the ship.

01:43:16.157 --> 01:43:17.056
<i>So...</i>

01:43:21.663 --> 01:43:26.999
Did you drop by to apologize for
putting me in the fucking place?

01:43:27.001 --> 01:43:28.100
Or what?

01:43:28.102 --> 01:43:30.436
<i>You put yourself in
here, old man.</i>

01:43:31.439 --> 01:43:36.342
I beg to differ on
that little point, Jimmy.

01:43:39.113 --> 01:43:42.748
The way I see it,
it was you.

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:47.420
And that fuckin' piece of shit,
Woods put me in here.

01:43:48.256 --> 01:43:50.756
Oh, it's okay. It's all good.

01:43:50.758 --> 01:43:52.358
I forgives ya.

01:43:53.194 --> 01:43:57.496
Yeah, you done me like
God did Jesus.

01:44:00.034 --> 01:44:02.535
But I can take it.

01:44:03.838 --> 01:44:05.071
'Cause I'm a man.

01:44:07.642 --> 01:44:13.479
<i>And, besides. I haven't been
completely abandoned.</i>

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:19.051
Family come in often,
do they?

01:44:19.053 --> 01:44:20.853
<i>Me brother,
not so much.</i>

01:44:20.855 --> 01:44:21.887
<i>Once or twice.</i>

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:26.626
<i>But Danny. Once
or twice a month.</i>

01:44:27.295 --> 01:44:29.495
Yeah, he's a good one, Danny.

01:44:29.497 --> 01:44:30.997
Comes by for a little advice.

01:44:30.999 --> 01:44:31.964
Stuff like that.

01:44:33.234 --> 01:44:35.568
You know, he always showed me-

01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:39.071
the respect a father deserves.

01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:42.742
Yeah, you really bought
his love, didn't you?

01:44:42.744 --> 01:44:45.911
<i>I did right.
And he knows it.</i>

01:44:47.882 --> 01:44:49.448
You knows it too.

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:52.852
You just don't wanna say it.

01:44:56.157 --> 01:44:59.091
You wanna know where all your
great advice got Danny?

01:44:59.894 --> 01:45:01.527
<i>Danny's doing all right.</i>

01:45:01.529 --> 01:45:02.962
Yeah, he's doing alright-

01:45:02.964 --> 01:45:07.066
for someone who just got his
fuckin' nose cut off his face.

01:45:16.678 --> 01:45:20.846
Well. That wouldn't
be my advice.

01:45:22.684 --> 01:45:25.184
Danny must have done
something to deserve it.

01:45:26.154 --> 01:45:28.087
You know Danny.

01:45:28.089 --> 01:45:31.791
He was always too emotional.

01:45:34.195 --> 01:45:35.695
Shame I'm in here.

01:45:35.697 --> 01:45:39.732
Never woulda
happened on my watch.

01:45:40.635 --> 01:45:41.600
No.

01:45:42.103 --> 01:45:43.602
I woulda handled it.

01:45:44.405 --> 01:45:47.473
I handled it.
They're dead.

01:45:48.242 --> 01:45:49.241
<i>Atta boy.</i>

01:45:50.411 --> 01:45:52.311
How'd you do it?

01:45:52.313 --> 01:45:53.779
<i>Gun.</i>

01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:54.580
Gun?

01:45:54.582 --> 01:45:55.915
Oh no. That's not good.

01:45:55.917 --> 01:45:59.185
You gotta use your hand
if you wanna be a man.

01:46:00.254 --> 01:46:03.956
But, I bet it felt
good though, did it?

01:46:08.329 --> 01:46:09.895
<i>So.</i>

01:46:10.665 --> 01:46:13.532
<i>How was your mother's funeral?</i>

01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:18.938
I hope as beautiful as her.

01:46:21.376 --> 01:46:22.241
You know...

01:46:23.244 --> 01:46:25.945
I had a little drink
in her honor.

01:46:31.152 --> 01:46:33.519
Now, come one.
That was funny.

01:46:37.625 --> 01:46:40.893
Eight years you been in
here. You still can't dry out.

01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:44.730
They're not as
clever as you were.

01:46:47.769 --> 01:46:49.969
You know you still owes me
for all those bottles

01:46:49.971 --> 01:46:53.105
you emptied on me when
you were a little fucker.

01:46:54.375 --> 01:46:57.276
Ten years old. Outsmarting
someone as smart as me.

01:46:57.278 --> 01:46:59.545
I shoulda hit you up
side he head.

01:46:59.547 --> 01:47:01.313
<i>Dulled that big fuckin'
brain of yours.</i>

01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:05.151
<i>Maybe I wouldn't be in
here now, huh?</i>

01:47:11.859 --> 01:47:12.792
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:47:13.728 --> 01:47:16.228
You know, I'd kill for a fuckin'
kit in here.

01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:19.031
I would. Ease the tension.

01:47:19.033 --> 01:47:20.132
Know what I mean?

01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:23.636
You still play?

01:47:25.139 --> 01:47:26.305
<i>Nope.</i>

01:47:26.307 --> 01:47:28.140
Probably all for the best.

01:47:28.142 --> 01:47:30.109
You never were as good as me.

01:47:31.078 --> 01:47:34.013
All that fuckin' fast
shit you used to play.

01:47:34.015 --> 01:47:35.648
Nuthin' but noise.

01:47:35.650 --> 01:47:36.982
<i>No art to it.</i>

01:47:42.156 --> 01:47:44.857
<i>♪ Sonny don't go away. ♪</i>

01:47:44.859 --> 01:47:47.993
<i>♪ I am here all alone. ♪</i>

01:47:47.995 --> 01:47:53.799
<i>♪ And your daddy's a sailor,
who never comes home. ♪</i>

01:47:53.801 --> 01:48:00.272
<i>♪ And the nights are so long
And the silence goes on ♪</i>

01:48:00.274 --> 01:48:08.347
<i>♪ Im feeling so tired
I'm just not that strong ♪</i>

01:48:14.355 --> 01:48:15.855
Nuthin'.

01:48:16.524 --> 01:48:18.891
Fuck. Tough crowd.

01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:27.766
Mom always used to say that
you had a sickness.

01:48:29.036 --> 01:48:31.971
That when you were drinking,
it wasn't really you.

01:48:31.973 --> 01:48:34.874
That I shouldn't hold that
against you.

01:48:34.876 --> 01:48:38.143
Because you weren't yourself.

01:48:38.145 --> 01:48:41.680
She said that you
were Jekyll and Hyde.

01:48:42.416 --> 01:48:45.417
She was full of shit.

01:48:46.521 --> 01:48:51.557
You were always being yourself.

01:48:51.559 --> 01:48:54.927
You're just a fuckin' scumbag.

01:48:57.565 --> 01:49:00.599
Why'd you come here, Jimmy?

01:49:00.601 --> 01:49:03.202
To call me names?

01:49:03.204 --> 01:49:04.870
Or do you need a hug?

01:49:14.749 --> 01:49:16.348
I just needed to know.

01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:17.950
<i>Know what?</i>

01:49:17.952 --> 01:49:20.219
Know that I'm not like you.

01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:24.023
<i>Well, I'll tell ya.</i>

01:49:24.592 --> 01:49:26.825
I'm in there somewhere.

01:49:30.498 --> 01:49:31.397
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:49:31.999 --> 01:49:33.232
<i>Mom is too.</i>

01:49:34.435 --> 01:49:36.802
<i>She's gonna do what she
shoulda done a long time ago.</i>

01:49:36.804 --> 01:49:38.804
Yeah, what's that?

01:49:40.041 --> 01:49:40.773
Kill you.

01:49:42.376 --> 01:49:43.809
<i>Never woulda happened.</i>

01:49:45.746 --> 01:49:49.014
See, she loved me.

01:49:49.817 --> 01:49:52.117
Even more than she loved you.

01:49:52.653 --> 01:49:54.320
That's fuckin' bullshit.

01:49:54.322 --> 01:49:55.120
<i>Is it?</i>

01:49:55.122 --> 01:49:55.854
Mm hmm.

01:49:57.692 --> 01:50:02.061
<i>Do you remember the time
you tried to fight me?</i>

01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:04.163
You were a little bigger,

01:50:04.165 --> 01:50:06.865
so you probably thought
you could take me.

01:50:08.369 --> 01:50:09.101
<i>I remember.</i>

01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:13.405
<i>I remember I shoulda brought
a fuckin' baseball bat.</i>

01:50:13.407 --> 01:50:18.377
Nah. You gotta have the stomach
for something like that.

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.880
You were too sensitive.

01:50:23.618 --> 01:50:24.950
How old were you then?

01:50:25.453 --> 01:50:26.819
Seventeen? Eighteen?

01:50:26.821 --> 01:50:28.754
<i>Just turned eighteen.</i>

01:50:30.524 --> 01:50:31.957
And what happened?

01:50:33.628 --> 01:50:34.893
You were a full grown man.

01:50:34.895 --> 01:50:36.362
You overpowered me.

01:50:36.364 --> 01:50:37.663
<i>Uh huh.</i>

01:50:37.665 --> 01:50:39.632
<i>And then what?</i>

01:50:39.634 --> 01:50:41.200
Then I left home.

01:50:43.371 --> 01:50:45.771
I'll tell you what I remember.

01:50:46.674 --> 01:50:50.743
I remember your mother
pulling you aside-

01:50:50.745 --> 01:50:53.512
And slapping the shit outta you.

01:50:53.514 --> 01:50:57.082
And you crying like
a little baby.

01:50:57.084 --> 01:50:59.585
As she threw you out
the front door.

01:50:59.587 --> 01:51:02.221
And told you never to come back.

01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:10.329
<i>You see.</i>

01:51:10.865 --> 01:51:13.065
She picked me.

01:51:14.635 --> 01:51:18.804
She could never stand
to see you hurt me.

01:51:20.307 --> 01:51:22.408
She picked me over you.

01:51:23.778 --> 01:51:24.943
And that-

01:51:24.945 --> 01:51:29.048
is the meaning of true love,

01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:30.482
my boy.

01:51:35.823 --> 01:51:39.324
Yeah. I did.

01:51:39.994 --> 01:51:43.462
I had a drink to remember her.

01:51:45.399 --> 01:51:52.438
You see, she always loved it
when I'd take her to bed drunk.

01:51:58.312 --> 01:52:00.446
She liked it rough.

01:52:15.863 --> 01:52:18.997
Truth hurts,
doesn't it, boy?

01:52:22.303 --> 01:52:24.770
I know you don't
wanna talk about it.

01:52:24.772 --> 01:52:27.473
But the kids have got
to see you.

01:52:27.475 --> 01:52:28.674
Jess.

01:52:28.676 --> 01:52:30.042
They can't see me like this.

01:52:30.044 --> 01:52:31.643
They love you.
They miss you.

01:52:31.645 --> 01:52:33.145
They don't care what
you look like.

01:52:33.147 --> 01:52:35.214
You know the doctor
said that if I cry-

01:52:35.216 --> 01:52:36.782
it could fuck up the surgery.

01:52:36.784 --> 01:52:39.351
And if they come in here
and I see them-

01:52:39.353 --> 01:52:40.419
I'm gonna cry.

01:52:41.889 --> 01:52:43.489
So please just drop it,
okay?

01:52:43.491 --> 01:52:46.225
Okay. You're right.

01:52:48.462 --> 01:52:49.628
I'll explain it to them.

01:52:54.168 --> 01:52:55.234
Ugh.

01:52:55.569 --> 01:52:56.301
This is shit.

01:52:56.704 --> 01:52:58.003
You gotta eat.

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:01.640
Come on,
you gotta eat.

01:53:01.642 --> 01:53:02.641
You gotta get better.

01:53:02.643 --> 01:53:04.276
You gotta get outta here.

01:53:04.278 --> 01:53:06.278
Can you run out and get me
something else?

01:53:07.014 --> 01:53:08.647
Yes. Will you eat it?

01:53:08.983 --> 01:53:09.648
Mm hmm.

01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:11.016
What do you want?

01:53:11.018 --> 01:53:12.518
Burger and fries from Ches's?

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.385
Done.

01:53:14.021 --> 01:53:15.487
Anything to drink with that?

01:53:15.489 --> 01:53:16.889
Surprise me.

01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:23.028
Jesus Christ, your face!

01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:25.130
You look so much better.

01:53:25.132 --> 01:53:26.165
Ha ha.

01:53:28.235 --> 01:53:28.934
Love you.

01:53:28.936 --> 01:53:30.002
I love you.

01:53:30.004 --> 01:53:31.403
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

01:53:32.473 --> 01:53:35.007
No, I'm just going out to get
him some real food.

01:53:35.009 --> 01:53:36.175
<i>What's wrong with that there?</i>

01:53:36.177 --> 01:53:38.477
It's shit. That's
what's wrong with it.

01:53:38.479 --> 01:53:40.012
<i>Well, it looks fine to me.</i>

01:53:40.014 --> 01:53:41.580
You come eat it.

01:53:41.582 --> 01:53:42.381
<i>I will.</i>

01:53:42.883 --> 01:53:45.117
I'll be back soon.

01:53:47.388 --> 01:53:48.520
<i>Yeah. Alright.</i>

01:53:49.757 --> 01:53:50.622
<i>You sure now?</i>

01:53:51.659 --> 01:53:53.325
I'm sure, Doug.
It tastes like shit.

01:53:54.395 --> 01:53:56.128
Well, you haven't even
touched the meat.

01:53:57.631 --> 01:53:58.530
Tell you what.

01:53:58.532 --> 01:53:59.498
I'll be your taster, alright?

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:00.632
Yeah, go right ahead.

01:54:00.634 --> 01:54:02.634
Just like with the
King of England.

01:54:04.872 --> 01:54:06.738
Just in case it's
poison, you know.

01:54:10.611 --> 01:54:11.610
<i>It's not that bed.</i>

01:54:12.913 --> 01:54:14.313
<i>Better than I could make.</i>

01:54:15.549 --> 01:54:17.683
You make it sound like you need
some cooking class or something.

01:54:18.619 --> 01:54:20.619
Nah.
I knows how to open a can.

01:54:20.621 --> 01:54:21.520
Use the microwave.

01:54:22.623 --> 01:54:24.356
Jesus Christ.

01:54:25.426 --> 01:54:29.361
Hey, we can't all have fancy
tastes, your Majesty.

01:54:29.897 --> 01:54:30.896
Want the pudding?

01:54:30.898 --> 01:54:32.064
No.

01:54:37.738 --> 01:54:40.138
You-you hear form Jimmy?

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:43.842
<i>No.
I tried calling him.</i>

01:54:43.844 --> 01:54:45.510
<i>But there's no answer.</i>

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:47.212
Sounds about right.

01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:51.516
<i>Did you talk to him at all?</i>

01:54:51.518 --> 01:54:53.552
<i>Like in the ambulance,
or anything?</i>

01:54:54.822 --> 01:54:55.587
No.

01:54:57.157 --> 01:54:58.557
All I heard was gunshots.

01:55:00.661 --> 01:55:03.595
I didn't know it was him until
I was on the stretcher.

01:55:03.597 --> 01:55:05.163
And he didn't say a word.

01:55:07.034 --> 01:55:11.203
He didn't ride in the
ambulance with me.

01:55:14.675 --> 01:55:15.641
<i>Doesn't surprise me.</i>

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:22.681
Did I ever tell you about when
he told his mother-

01:55:22.683 --> 01:55:24.416
Gus was going to prison?

01:55:25.452 --> 01:55:26.184
No. Were you there?

01:55:26.186 --> 01:55:29.087
I was dropping something
off at the house.

01:55:31.792 --> 01:55:32.691
He comes in.

01:55:33.727 --> 01:55:35.260
Stands in the kitchen.
No hello.

01:55:36.130 --> 01:55:40.332
He just says it. Bluntly.
In one sentence.

01:55:42.736 --> 01:55:44.603
She kept asking him, Why?

01:55:46.273 --> 01:55:48.807
He just stood there
like a statue.

01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:51.410
She started crying-

01:55:52.212 --> 01:55:54.146
Hitting him, slapping him.

01:55:56.050 --> 01:55:57.449
His face didn't change,

01:55:58.719 --> 01:56:00.285
I never saw anything like it.

01:56:01.956 --> 01:56:03.555
<i>I had to pull her away.</i>

01:56:04.558 --> 01:56:05.457
Jesus.

01:56:06.427 --> 01:56:07.359
<i>Yup.</i>

01:56:09.997 --> 01:56:11.763
<i>He was gone a few days later.</i>

01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:17.402
<i>But-
such is life.</i>

01:56:27.715 --> 01:56:29.448
<i>This is a
final boarding call</i>

01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:32.250
<i>for flight one eighty two with
non stop service to Toronto.</i>

01:56:32.252 --> 01:56:33.518
<i>All remaining passengers</i>

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.821
<i>should be boarding through
gate number three.</i>

01:56:36.305 --> 01:56:42.678
