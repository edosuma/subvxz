Can I break this one?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.252
Eh...
Don't.

00:53.337 --> 00:55.370
Looks like a doggie.

01:06.684 --> 01:09.068

04:10.801 --> 04:13.568
Who's paying you?

04:32.106 --> 04:33.105
No, mate.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.506
What are you doing?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.744
The dirt's supposed to go
outside the hole, pal.

04:38.846 --> 04:39.778
Huh?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.781
Can I...
can I ask a favor?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.066
No, you can't.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.474
Have you got kids?
Huh?

04:52.576 --> 04:55.310
I've got a family.
I've got two kids.

04:55.412 --> 04:56.545
They aren't...

04:56.647 --> 04:58.146

04:58.248 --> 05:01.733
Can you just not bury me...
not bury me.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.168
I gotta bury you, mate.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.170
No, no, no, so they won't...

05:05.272 --> 05:06.738
they'll know
what happened to me.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.241
They won't...
they won't be left wondering.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.843
Your wife knows
what you do, don't she?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.913
Can I leave a note?
Can I leave...

05:15.015 --> 05:16.048
can I just leave a note?

05:16.150 --> 05:17.265
Just to say that I'm dead.

05:17.368 --> 05:19.234
She'll put two
and two together, mate.

05:19.336 --> 05:21.203
Just keep fucking digging,
will ya?

05:29.213 --> 05:31.947
Don't look at me, cunt.
Look at the fucking hole.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.810
Please, please,
please, please, Please.

06:00.144 --> 06:01.243
Can you tell my family that I...

06:35.913 --> 06:38.180
Dad.

06:38.282 --> 06:39.581
Mm.

06:39.683 --> 06:42.701
Sharny told me
that he's not real.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.138
How would she know?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.639
Her mom told her.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.441
So is he real?

06:52.479 --> 06:54.613
Um...

06:56.350 --> 06:59.301
Santa's like a...
myth.

06:59.403 --> 07:00.869
What's that?

07:00.971 --> 07:03.972
It's like a...

07:04.074 --> 07:05.807
like a tradition.

07:05.909 --> 07:09.244
So he is real?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.947
No, he's not, no.

07:12.049 --> 07:12.681
So where do
presents come from?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.669
- I buy them.
- So why'd you lie about that?

07:19.239 --> 07:20.839
Good question.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.375
I mean...

07:23.477 --> 07:26.678
I don't even know where the
whole Santa thing comes from.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.581
It must got to do
with Jesus being born.

07:31.902 --> 07:34.803
Is Jesus real?

07:34.905 --> 07:37.806
Yeah, look,
I never met the guy, but...

07:37.908 --> 07:39.307
possibly.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.545
What about
the Easter bunny?

07:43.647 --> 07:45.447
No.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.901
The tooth fairy?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.019
Uh...

07:52.940 --> 07:53.905
The tooth fairy's
not real either?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.009
Mm-mm.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.247
What about unicorns?

08:11.775 --> 08:13.475
No, unicorns are real.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.809
Really?
How do you know?

08:14.912 --> 08:17.979
- I've seen one.
- Where?

08:18.815 --> 08:20.315
Blue mountains.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.785
So what happened?

08:23.871 --> 08:25.770
I was driving.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.906
I was driving...

08:28.008 --> 08:30.976
through the mountains and um...

08:33.046 --> 08:34.578
Yes, I needed to wee.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.465
So...

08:37.534 --> 08:40.001
when I got out...

08:40.102 --> 08:42.169
I could hear this noise.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.270
Like, um...

08:43.373 --> 08:45.540
you know when a horse runs?

08:45.642 --> 08:50.145
That noise.
And um...

08:50.247 --> 08:53.281
Yeah, I'm standing there, like,
on the edge of this clearing.

08:53.383 --> 08:55.767
And I can hear
this clip-clop noise

08:55.869 --> 08:57.669
and it's getting louder
and louder.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.038
Then I look up...

09:00.207 --> 09:02.741
And on the other side
of the clearing...

09:02.843 --> 09:04.109
there's this unicorn.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.179
Were you scared?

09:08.282 --> 09:10.515
Actually I was a little bit,
yeah.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.701
Yeah, so I'm like...

09:12.803 --> 09:13.568
standing there
and I'm looking at him

09:13.670 --> 09:15.470
and he's looking at me...

09:15.572 --> 09:17.639
And then he um...

09:19.509 --> 09:23.445
he starts smiling at me.
Huh.

09:23.547 --> 09:26.081
And then he winks at me.
He goes like that.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.268
And he says...

09:30.370 --> 09:33.138
"You take care, Ray."

09:33.240 --> 09:36.107
And... then he flew off.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.245
Wait.
How did he know your name?

09:42.149 --> 09:44.699
Unicorn's know
everybody's name.

09:53.310 --> 09:54.776
Fuck.

09:54.878 --> 09:57.045
Dad, $1.

09:59.383 --> 10:00.515
<i>Champion and, in fact,</i>

10:00.601 --> 10:02.167
<i>I did my sums wrong
before the break.</i>

10:02.269 --> 10:04.436
<i>Joan's going home with
over $10,000 worth of prizes</i>

10:04.538 --> 10:06.871

10:06.974 --> 10:08.506
<i>Yeah, give her
a round of applause.</i>

10:08.609 --> 10:10.241
<i>That's good.</i>

10:10.344 --> 10:13.011
You gotta go?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.480
- No, not yet.
- <i>So well done.</i>

10:15.582 --> 10:17.832
<i>But you'd still like
to win today, wouldn't you?</i>

10:17.934 --> 10:19.501
- <i>Oh, I love to win.</i>
- <i>It's easily done...</i>

10:19.603 --> 10:21.236
What's going on?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.206
Nothing.

10:25.309 --> 10:27.542
Spill it.

10:29.413 --> 10:31.413
Gotta go to court.

10:31.515 --> 10:33.882
Now?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.501
Tomorrow.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.704
What did you do?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.107
Bashed a dickhead.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.644
What happened?

10:45.746 --> 10:48.213
I don't wanna talk about it.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.481
How did they get you?

10:51.068 --> 10:54.302
Rego.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.970
Got a couple of witnesses.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.207
What are you laughing at?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.211
You're getting sloppy.

11:03.313 --> 11:06.014
You can talk.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.403
It's not the fact
that you get to see

11:11.505 --> 11:12.404
all the pretty girls
taking a shower,

11:12.506 --> 11:15.106
all though
that's pretty good...

11:15.208 --> 11:16.274
It's that...
if I'm running late for work,

11:16.376 --> 11:18.276
I don't have
to take one at home, you know?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.779
Ray.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.533
Ray.

11:25.635 --> 11:27.001
What's going on?

11:27.104 --> 11:29.270
- Hey, that guy, Henson?
- Yeah?

11:29.373 --> 11:31.773
- He's not the guy.
- What does that mean?

11:31.875 --> 11:33.575
Well, we thought
he was the guy.

11:33.677 --> 11:35.677
The guy who killed Willie Keys.

11:35.779 --> 11:39.013
See, Henson...
he owed Willie 60 grand,

11:39.116 --> 11:41.666
so we thought it was him...

11:41.768 --> 11:43.401
but it wasn't.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.337
So I killed the wrong bloke?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.640
Hey, look, mate.
I'm sorry.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.241
What... we thought it was him.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.778
What's the... what's the problem?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.081
Next time make sure
you got the right fucking guy.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.069
All right.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.838
Can you wash
your hands first please?

13:26.940 --> 13:27.872
- Yeah.
- And then we're gonna go

13:27.974 --> 13:29.941
straight on to homework.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.370
Luke said
to give this to you

13:42.472 --> 13:43.304
if anything
ever happened to him.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.406
What?

13:45.509 --> 13:47.175
What... what do you mean?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.411
So you been married?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.813
- Engaged.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.766
But I was,

14:13.136 --> 14:14.669
Dodged a bullet.

14:16.406 --> 14:18.773

Got a daughter.

14:24.848 --> 14:26.414
What's her name?

14:26.516 --> 14:27.765
Britt.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.235
Brittany.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.402
How old is she?

14:32.472 --> 14:35.206
Eight.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.842
So what's she into?
Horses?

14:37.944 --> 14:39.177
Unicorns.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.082
- Cute.
- Mm.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.134
What else?

14:49.639 --> 14:52.407
Extortion.

14:52.509 --> 14:54.309
What?

14:54.411 --> 14:56.978
She got this thing
if you swear...

14:57.080 --> 14:58.580
she charges you a dollar.

14:59.583 --> 15:02.166
Oh, yeah, like a...
like a swear jar.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.569
Yeah but there's no jar.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.404
Money just goes
straight in her pocket.

15:06.506 --> 15:10.041
- Swear pocket.
- Swear pocket.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.146
What's going on?

15:32.248 --> 15:34.365
Sorry.
It's just a friend of mine.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.501
She's having guy trouble.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.236
Mm. What's happening?

15:38.338 --> 15:41.272
Oh, no,
she's seeing this guy and...

15:41.374 --> 15:44.442
I don't know, they're kind of
serious but she's thinking...

15:44.544 --> 15:45.443
I don't know,
she's thinking maybe

15:45.545 --> 15:47.645
he's not exactly
boyfriend material.

15:47.747 --> 15:48.479
Oh, okay.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.767
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.402
I mean, I get along fine
and the sex is great.

15:54.504 --> 15:56.037
It's just...

15:56.139 --> 15:57.505
He's a bit shit
in the kissing department.

15:57.607 --> 16:00.308
Oh.
Is that right?

16:00.410 --> 16:01.943
Mm.

16:03.346 --> 16:05.613
I think
you gotta find somebody...

16:05.715 --> 16:06.948
like everybody's
got their own style.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.366
- Mm.
- And you just gotta

16:08.468 --> 16:11.336
find somebody
that fits your style.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.938
Otherwise...

16:14.040 --> 16:16.174
it's not gonna work.

16:16.276 --> 16:21.846
<i>♪ Time drips slow ♪</i>

16:21.948 --> 16:22.947
<i>♪ It's gonna take its toll ♪</i>

16:23.049 --> 16:25.066

- Mm?

16:28.038 --> 16:29.003
Yep.

16:31.141 --> 16:35.910

16:36.012 --> 16:38.279

16:42.502 --> 16:45.136
Yeah, it's good.
Mm-hmm.

17:14.017 --> 17:15.199
Hey.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.944
So what's the story?

17:27.881 --> 17:31.099
The doctor put him in coma.

17:31.201 --> 17:33.668
They say
there might be brain damage.

17:44.247 --> 17:46.013
Hey, hey, hey.

17:46.116 --> 17:48.299
Come on.
Come on.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.368
He'll be all right.
Okay?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.136
He's a fighter.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.139
And he's gonna be fine.
Okay?

17:55.241 --> 17:56.707
All right?

17:56.810 --> 17:59.744
Hey?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.465
So what happened?

18:04.567 --> 18:06.868
These fucking cock fuckers.

18:06.970 --> 18:09.804
They bash him.

18:09.906 --> 18:12.473
We was doing deal.
They buy the guns.

18:12.575 --> 18:15.109
Then these guys come in
and they bash Gary.

18:15.211 --> 18:15.610
Take the guns.

18:19.916 --> 18:22.133
So who were these guys?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.201
I don't know.
They had mask on.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.870
I can't see face.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.305
You're doing a gun deal
with blokes with masks

18:27.407 --> 18:28.339
- on their faces...
- No, no.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.109
We do deal with guy.
I know this guy.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.512
And while we do deal,
these other guys come in.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.148
They bash Gary
and they take guns.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.432
Okay.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.002
So what's the name of the guy
you're doing the deal with?

18:41.104 --> 18:42.303
Why you want to know this?

18:42.405 --> 18:44.572
Why don't you wanna
fucking tell me?

18:44.674 --> 18:46.641
His name is Hassam.

18:48.645 --> 18:50.678
How come they didn't
bash you?

18:50.780 --> 18:52.446
'Cause I didn't
have the guns.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.182
They kicked me in balls.
My balls are killing.

18:54.284 --> 18:56.300
You want to see? Huh?

18:56.402 --> 18:57.702
Show you my...

18:57.804 --> 19:00.404
No, I don't want to see
your fucking balls, you idiot.

19:01.908 --> 19:02.840
Got one of the good though,

19:02.942 --> 19:05.076
huh, one of the cock fuckers.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.777
I punching him in...
his face.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.246
You punched him
three times in the face?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.048
- Right in the face.
- Oh, how's your hands?

19:11.167 --> 19:12.567
- Your hands all right, mate?
- Yeah, they're good.

19:12.669 --> 19:14.502
Yeah, okay.
Well, that's good.

19:14.604 --> 19:16.037
'Cause I used to box
when I kid.

19:16.139 --> 19:17.104
- Oh, did you?
- Yeah.

19:17.207 --> 19:18.406
So I can punch him very good.

19:18.508 --> 19:20.007
Yeah.
Nice. All right.

19:20.109 --> 19:21.509
Thanks.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.242
Wash your hands,
you dirty prick.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.412
Oh, you scare
fucking shit of me.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.480
What you do, Ray?

19:42.582 --> 19:43.648
Take a seat, mate.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.469
What fucking seats, huh?
You come into my house

19:48.571 --> 19:49.303
and you tell me...

19:52.508 --> 19:55.243
- Fuck off me, huh.
- Huh? What are you gonna do?

19:55.345 --> 19:57.278
Let's go for a ride, mate.
Over here, dickhead.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.346
- Stop.
- Come on.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.481
- That's it.
- What the fuck you doing?

20:00.583 --> 20:02.333
You going to fucking kill me,
Ray?

20:02.435 --> 20:06.537
Huh? Man, I had nothing to do
with the Gary thing.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.772
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.540
Prove it.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.211
- See that hand?
- So?

20:13.313 --> 20:14.712
Yep.

20:18.067 --> 20:20.134
See that?
Huh?

20:20.236 --> 20:21.202
That's what your hand
should look like.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.038
Okay, okay.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.073
Okay, I lied to you about that.

20:26.175 --> 20:29.377
But everything else is true.
I swear on life of my family.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.648
The fuck you doing?

20:33.750 --> 20:36.834
Ray, Ray.
I'm Gary brother-of-law.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.736
Okay, mate.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.505
Here's how it's gonna go,
all right?

20:41.608 --> 20:44.308
You start telling
the truth, okay,

20:44.410 --> 20:47.178
or I'm gonna cut your dick off.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.780
And then I'm gonna go
flush it down the dunny.

20:49.882 --> 20:50.881
Okay?

20:52.902 --> 20:54.168
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life

20:54.270 --> 20:56.270
walking around with a stub
where your cock used to be.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.301
Vasilli.
It's Hassam.

21:20.013 --> 21:22.680
Come in.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.000
Whoa.

21:26.102 --> 21:27.868
Hands up.

21:27.971 --> 21:30.004
Where's the piece?

21:30.106 --> 21:31.639
Waist band.

21:38.348 --> 21:40.614
On the bed.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.168
Both of you.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.771
Go on.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.643
All right.
Start talking.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.978
About what?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.946
What do you think?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.300
It was Vasilli's idea
in the first place.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.869
Don't you lie, cock fucker.

22:03.306 --> 22:04.905
He came to me
a couple of days ago,

22:05.008 --> 22:06.574
said we should rip him off.

22:09.312 --> 22:10.644
I didn't want them to bash him

22:10.747 --> 22:13.280
but your friend's
got some balls and...

22:13.383 --> 22:15.499
he put up a good fight,
you know?

22:16.269 --> 22:17.968
So who bashed him?

22:18.071 --> 22:21.272
Just...
guys I know.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.174
They got names?

22:25.478 --> 22:27.778
If I tell you...

22:27.880 --> 22:29.647
will you kill them?

22:36.472 --> 22:38.172
- Stop, stop, stop.
- What?

22:38.274 --> 22:40.374
What is it?
Hey.

22:43.646 --> 22:45.780
I think there's
something out there.

22:45.882 --> 22:47.615
There's nothing out there,

22:47.717 --> 22:48.799
