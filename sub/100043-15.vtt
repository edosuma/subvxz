WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.544
Oh, goodbye, drawer

00:02.628 --> 00:05.047
dedicated to batteries
and take-out menus.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.132
And goodbye, wall dent,

00:07.216 --> 00:09.968
from when we thought
Lily was a trombone prodigy.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.638
Mitchell.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.847
That was your last

00:13.931 --> 00:14.973
- eye roll in this house.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.893
You know what? When the new baby comes,
can you not do it as much?

00:17.893 --> 00:19.144
Because, you know,

00:19.228 --> 00:21.271
you did it around Lily a lot. Ugh.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.107
Okay, hey, no, no, no.
Don't throw those away.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.277
I might wanna use those for
my big baby reveal to the family.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.905
If he's bald, I can do
a whole Elton John thing.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.617
Not only are we moving, but we're adopting
a baby that's due in two weeks.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.827
And that is stressing me out

00:35.911 --> 00:39.414
because 11 years ago
I revealed Lily with <i>The Lion King,</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:41.416
- and there's a lot of pressure...
- Self-imposed.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.337
...to top myself. So, I've been
workshopping a few ideas.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.757
I hope everyone here likes baby.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.760
I can see that taking
everyone's breath away, no?

00:52.052 --> 00:55.055
Uh, I'm more concerned about
the city taking our baby away.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.737
Okay, the repair guys are gonna be here
in five minutes.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.406
I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:12.406 --> 01:13.490
but we might actually be
getting away with...

01:14.700 --> 01:17.160
Hey.
- Hey, what are you guys doing home?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.495
Yeah, I thought you went
to that beach cleanup.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.499
Well, we tried, but the beach yoga people
wouldn't even move 100 feet down.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.585
You'd think they'd have been
a little more flexible.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.669
Oh, Phil.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.672
The good news is, we're back
and we are here to help you set up

01:28.672 --> 01:29.965
for the twins' Easter party.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.676
- Um... We're good.
- Anyway, we got this covered.

01:32.676 --> 01:36.138
And you guys had such a long morning.
Why don't Gamma and Grampy

01:36.138 --> 01:38.682
grab a nap so that
they're fresh for the party, huh?

01:38.682 --> 01:40.309
Okay.
Okay.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.478
- But, uh...
- It's all good, we got it.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.607
Last weekend, Mom and Dad went
to the Artichoke Festival in Monterey.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.941
And Dylan's mom had the twins,

01:48.025 --> 01:50.235
so we took the opportunity
to have a little party,

01:50.319 --> 01:52.905
just to see if we still
had it in us. We did.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.115
<i>I'm trackin' the pizza guy</i>

01:55.199 --> 01:57.075
<i>The pizza guy, the pizza guy</i>

01:57.159 --> 01:58.702
<i>His name is Ibrahim</i>

01:58.702 --> 02:01.955
<i>Don't forget my garlic knots
Garlic knots, garlic knots</i>

02:02.039 --> 02:04.124
Yo, this party is the GOAT.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.753
Greatest of all time. I'm Doug,
across-the-street neighbor.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.839
I was just curbing my bins, heard
the party noise, thought I'd join up.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.341
Wanna refill on that?

02:12.341 --> 02:14.927
There is no scenario where
I accept a drink from you.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.220
Lit.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.849
Nice to see the Dunphy name
still carries some party clout.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.645
You know, we're running low
on jungle juice.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.980
Just soak it up with a towel and wring it
back into your cup.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.065
Okay.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.568
Cool. What kind is that?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.820
Can I have
one conversation tonight

02:33.904 --> 02:35.948
without someone asking me about my snake?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.284
Good Lord.
- What happened?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.119
I slipped on that drink you spilled.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.248
Hurt my ankle really bad.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.334
I mean, I don't wanna sue you,
but I don't really see any other option,

02:47.334 --> 02:48.418
do you?

02:50.254 --> 02:51.964
So now I work for Doug.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.424
Hey, everybody!

02:54.508 --> 02:56.176
Ibrahim has arrived, has arrive...

02:59.555 --> 03:00.973
Don't stare at it, put it out!

03:03.600 --> 03:05.060
We made some temporary fixes...

03:05.060 --> 03:06.728
<i>And scheduled repairs for today</i>

03:06.812 --> 03:09.147
<i>when Mom and Dad said
they'd be at the beach.</i>

03:09.231 --> 03:10.732
<i>Then they came home early.</i>

03:10.816 --> 03:13.360
It's just hard when you
can't trust family members.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.780
"Don't Gamma and Grampy wanna take a nap?"

03:16.864 --> 03:18.365
That's not insulting to you?

03:18.365 --> 03:20.117
Phil.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.579
I wasn't sleeping, I was listening.
And good for you, that is

03:23.579 --> 03:25.330
a lot of steps for one day.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.624
I was talking about the kids.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.793
They're treating us
like actual grandparents,

03:29.877 --> 03:33.922
instead of the premature
grandparents we clearly are.

03:34.256 --> 03:38.343
I'm the only one in my aqua aerobics class
who doesn't need two noodles.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.680
I put the eggs in a cute basket
for the Easter egg hunt.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.724
I saw it in a magazine. Cute.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.058
Haley.
- Oh, no.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.186
Honey, your dad and I didn't
feel like taking a nap.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.562
Why don't you give us a job for the party?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.939
Uh, well, we could use
some help dyeing those eggs,

03:51.023 --> 03:52.774
but why don't you
change for the party first?

03:52.858 --> 03:54.568
- Oh, good idea.
- Yes!

03:54.568 --> 03:56.445
Phil, wakey, wakey.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.655
Okay, we got 60 seconds, people.
We gotta move fast.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.491
Come on, come on. Yes, yes, yes.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.660
Come on, move faster.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.871
Let's go, let's go.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.707
Hurry up little bit.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.834
Come on. Get out of here now.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.919
Go, go, go.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.546
Thank you so much.
I love you guys so much. Bye.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.258
Okay. I think
we actually got away with it.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.469
Oh, no.
- I have to stop saying that.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.347
That dude from the party
who said that his python was pregnant,

04:23.347 --> 04:24.890
do you think those could be her eggs?

04:24.890 --> 04:28.185
Oh, my God. Is one of them hatching?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.269
That's so disgusting. Oh.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.729
We have to cancel the party.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.315
What? No way. We just got back
in with this parent group

04:33.315 --> 04:35.234
after our daughter's biting spree.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.278
If they didn't love their kids
getting gummed by an adorable toddler,

04:38.362 --> 04:39.655
I don't think they're
gonna love their kids

04:39.655 --> 04:41.365
getting punctured by a python.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.117
Calm down. Snakes lay all their
eggs in one dark place.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.119
I've got them all here.
I'm gonna run them by the pet store.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.121
Oh, my God, is one of them moving?
Get them out of here.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.498
That is so gross, gross, gross.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.586
Hey, where are you
running off to, little buddy?

04:57.005 --> 05:00.133
And where are you
running off to, big buddy?

05:04.012 --> 05:07.891
Hey, stranger. Going out again?
I barely see you these days.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.227
Uh, I'd love to hang out, Jay,
but I've got a wine club meeting.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.020
What? Are you into wine? I love wine.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.897
- Okay, see ya.
- Wait a minute.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.399
I'm gonna open a bottle later on,

05:15.399 --> 05:17.442
why don't you bring one,
and we'll have a little tasting.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.944
I guess I wouldn't mind that.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.529
I'll stop by the store on my way back.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.824
While you're there, would you be a prince
and pick me up a soda?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.158
I've got homework.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.828
- Where'd you get a 50?
- Don't worry about it.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.541
Welcome to your new house!

05:32.541 --> 05:36.086
I don't remember this room
feeling so stark and cold.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.630
Luckily this is a smart house.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.091
Adam, warm light mode.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.259
<i>Initiating.</i>

05:42.259 --> 05:43.760
Oh.
- Oh, no, no.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.929
That just brings out the
molding around the windows.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.765
Does it feel like we're in a nursing home?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.767
Adam, party mode.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.935
<i>Initiating.</i>

05:53.020 --> 05:55.397
Oh, God, no, no. That's even worse.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.984
I'm sorry, I just... I don't feel like
I've ever been in this house before.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.485
Adam, I swear to God.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.612
<i>Initiating.</i>

06:01.612 --> 06:03.280
Did we just make a huge mistake?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.032
Look, Mitchell, you know you hate change.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.533
- Oh...
- Remember when you shaved your beard?

06:06.617 --> 06:09.119
You screamed in the mirror,
"Oh, my God. You look hideous!"

06:09.203 --> 06:10.287
That was you.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.498
Ay, Mitch, you've been
a crab all day long.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.834
How do you know?
You haven't even been around us.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.294
I took a crazy guess.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.838
Look, this is buyer's remorse.

06:19.922 --> 06:23.258
I learned that from
my mentor, Phil Dunphy,

06:23.342 --> 06:24.635
and I know how to fix it.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.180
Come with me if you want
to live in this house,

06:28.180 --> 06:30.390
and not be a bummer to everyone.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.309
Lily, you need to help me start unpacking.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.061
We need to work on my baby reveal.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.605
Adam, thinking mode.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.731
<i>Initiating.</i>

06:43.487 --> 06:46.949
I know it sounds crazy, but it works.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.576
In order to accept the new house,

06:49.660 --> 06:52.412
you have to properly
say goodbye to this place.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.957
Okay, I'm not talking to a house, okay?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.000
And why are the movers
just sitting out there?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.253
Okay, don't worry about them.
I'll handle them.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.546
I used to be a mover.

07:00.546 --> 07:04.132
I kind of fell into it
when I helped an ex-boyfriend

07:04.216 --> 07:06.218
steal his brother's refrigerator.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.804
Okay, wait. So you've been
a cab driver, a hairdresser,

07:08.804 --> 07:12.599
a spokesmodel, and a mover.
Is your life real?

07:12.683 --> 07:14.017
Is anything real?

07:14.101 --> 07:18.105
This was a question that I asked myself
when I was a philosophy professor.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.984
Now, say goodbye to the house.

07:21.984 --> 07:25.153
Tell it how much it meant to you.

07:25.237 --> 07:28.282
Be honest with each other, like two lovers

07:28.282 --> 07:31.910
that know that the time has come
when they must part ways.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.705
Okay, well, usually I would just take
my gym membership off his keychain

07:34.705 --> 07:36.039
and then introduce him to my mother.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.212
Hey, house.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.757
Hey, you humps,
we're paying you by the hour.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.050
We're on a coffee break, lady.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.053
Don't give me that. I used to do your job.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.140
And this attitude,
this is why people hate movers.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.392
That and all the stealing.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.311
Whoa! You think you can do better?

07:57.311 --> 08:01.148
I hate to burst your
bubble wrap, but I know I can.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.942
We are actually double booked
today, so this works out.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.027
Have at it.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.821
Oh, no, no, no. Ay, wait!
Come back, humps!

08:09.072 --> 08:10.240
What are you doing with the cat?

08:10.324 --> 08:14.161
Okay, don't worry, on the day,
I will replace Larry with the baby.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.330
Once the family
is all seated around the table,

08:16.330 --> 08:18.624
I'll undo the security rope

08:18.624 --> 08:20.751
and then let the baby
hover above the table

08:20.751 --> 08:23.462
for all the family to marvel at.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.172
Wait. The phone's ringing.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.217
Hello. Yes. Speaking.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.344
What?

08:33.055 --> 08:34.056
No.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.561
Oh, honey, did you just take a sip
from the paintbrush water?

08:39.645 --> 08:41.855
I think I'd know
if I did, Claire.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.942
Oh, this must be the grandparents' table.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.485
- I didn't say that.
- No, I don't think it is.

08:46.485 --> 08:50.322
These are the kids' grandparents,
Gamma and Grampy.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.115
Oh! Nice to meet you.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.076
I'm Meemaw, this is Bobo.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.161
And have you met GimGim and Mimsy?

08:56.245 --> 08:57.955
Uh, you know what,
why don't you take our seats?

08:57.955 --> 08:59.581
I think we're
at the wrong table.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.252
- My back.
- Oh, it happens to me all the time.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.378
Oh.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.839
I'm gonna get you the name of these shoes.

09:06.839 --> 09:10.092
Doug, I have cooked for you,
spray-tanned you,

09:10.092 --> 09:12.511
taken two of your sign-spinning shifts.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.429
Are we seriously not even yet?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.223
I think you're making
too big a deal about this.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.392
I just need you to dress up
like Harley Quinn

09:18.392 --> 09:20.561
and give a foot massage
to the winner of my game night.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.188
Don't worry, I'm gonna win.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.570
And get this, Gerald fell again. Oh.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.779
Wrist this time.

09:30.863 --> 09:33.824
That man's got more pins in him
than a tailor's mouth.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.579
He never learned how to fall
the right way. Too proud.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.289
Wait, there's a right way to fall?

09:40.289 --> 09:41.874
Really? A follow-up?

09:41.874 --> 09:43.458
Resist the temptation

09:43.542 --> 09:45.752
to break the fall with the hands. Mmm.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.381
Land on your bottom.
Aim for the meat, not the bone.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.091
Oh... Mimsy!

09:52.718 --> 09:54.386
See? Good as new.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.722
My dear husband, such a gentleman.

09:56.722 --> 10:00.142
He always opens the bathtub door for me.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.226
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.311
Would you excuse us just a second?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.482
But she was!

10:07.566 --> 10:08.567
It's not good.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.152
I know, totally.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.863
We were just remembering
something that happened

10:12.863 --> 10:14.698
on our last Negroni crawl in Frogtown.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.033
Ah, Frogtown.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.203
"Bird on a bird!"

10:19.203 --> 10:21.622
You all got the TikTok invite
Bridget from Quibi sent out

10:21.622 --> 10:23.582
for her matcha pop-up on Thursday, right?

10:23.957 --> 10:27.211
- You guys down?
- Oh, yeah. That sounds... Frosty.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.131
Small hiccup.
When I got to the pet store

10:31.215 --> 10:33.008
I was down one python egg, which means...

10:33.008 --> 10:34.134
There's still one here?

10:34.218 --> 10:36.386
Yeah, and I just checked the living room,
it's not there.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.722
Okay, nuggets! Everyone outside.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.474
It's time for the egg hunt.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.560
Hey, small hiccup.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.354
Now it's time for the bottle I brought.

10:45.354 --> 10:46.647
Uh-uh-uh.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.440
Fresh glasses.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.444
This, my friend,
is a 2009 Chateau Trotanoy.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.864
You might wanna cinch your belt up.
It's liable to blow your trousers off.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.574
Hmm.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.118
- It's nice.
- "Nice"?

11:00.410 --> 11:04.289
I understand why you would like it,
but this is what my wine club friends

11:04.373 --> 11:05.624
would call "an obvious choice."

11:05.624 --> 11:08.544
I get it. You haven't developed
a taste for fine wine yet.

11:08.544 --> 11:12.464
Um, I hate to say it, but I probably
know more about wine than you do.

11:12.548 --> 11:16.260
Two months ago, you couldn't drink rosé
unless it was mixed with Snapple.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.136
There's only one way to settle this.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.389
Are you up for a little blind taste test?

11:20.389 --> 11:21.473
Bring it.

11:21.557 --> 11:25.310
Joe, go to the wine cellar,
pick out five random bottles.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.145
- We have a wine cellar?
- What's a wine cellar?

11:27.479 --> 11:31.275
You were my first.
And we'd both been through so much.

11:31.275 --> 11:35.779
I was neurotic, you had
a bathroom off the kitchen.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.740
But we both found each other.

11:38.824 --> 11:39.867
Anyway,

11:40.409 --> 11:43.120
I feel like, um, I have to say something.

11:43.120 --> 11:47.916
It's not you, it's me. I just, um...
I need more space.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.461
But we can still remember the good times.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.923
Um, like when I first moved in,
and all I had was that boombox.

11:56.842 --> 11:57.926
Yeah, um...

11:58.010 --> 11:59.261
What do you say? Yeah.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.679
Huh?

12:01.305 --> 12:02.431
One more time.

12:04.558 --> 12:10.647
<i>Now I've had the time of my life</i>

12:10.939 --> 12:14.860
<i>No, I never felt like this before</i>

12:15.360 --> 12:19.198
<i>Yes, I swear it's the truth</i>

12:19.198 --> 12:20.365
<i>And I...</i>

12:20.449 --> 12:21.533
What do you say?

12:21.617 --> 12:22.659
Huh?

12:22.743 --> 12:23.994
Takes you right back, right?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.915
To Valentine's Day 2003, and four.

12:28.624 --> 12:31.502
<i>And I owe it all to you</i>

12:31.502 --> 12:33.504
<i>Gloria was right.
Once I said goodbye,</i>

12:33.504 --> 12:35.631
I was able to embrace this new house

12:35.631 --> 12:38.592
and spend the next few weeks
getting ready for the baby.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.012
I just needed closure.
And so did those drapes.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.098
Because the dancing,
got, uh, got pretty dirty.

12:46.058 --> 12:52.439
<i>Because I've had the time of my life</i>

12:53.315 --> 12:57.152
<i>No, I never felt this way before</i>

12:57.528 --> 13:01.615
<i>Yes, I swear it's the truth</i>

13:03.492 --> 13:05.869
Mitchell, the baby's here. He's early.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.913
What? I'm not ready!

13:07.913 --> 13:09.122
Well, get ready.

13:09.206 --> 13:12.251
And we will be discussing why
you were <i>Time-of-My-Life</i>-ing without me.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.634
The uneducated palate would
identify this as a Cabernet,

13:20.634 --> 13:23.345
when in fact, it is a Merlot
from Bordeaux.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.265
- Correct.
- Oh! Lucky guess.

13:26.265 --> 13:29.017
In my 20s, I befriended
a sommelier from Paris.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.854
Marcel Carone. In fact,
I went to stay with him.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.188
We'd drink wine all night

13:33.564 --> 13:37.943
and fall asleep to the sound of
an accordion on the Rue de Montparnasse.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.821
Much like this wine, that story
has too many fruity notes.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.905
Next glass.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.241
And sip.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.537
Mmm.

13:49.705 --> 13:53.458
That is a mature Napa Valley Cabernet.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.003
- Correct.
- Eat that, old man!

13:56.003 --> 13:58.130
You know, you don't
have to spike the football

13:58.130 --> 13:59.506
every time you get an answer right.

13:59.590 --> 14:03.010
Only you could make talking about wine
into something obnoxious.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.345
Score is tied, two-two.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.222
Time now for the final wine.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.646
And to reveal the answer...

14:15.314 --> 14:17.608
Wait a minute. Maybe we shouldn't.

14:17.608 --> 14:21.403
Before we turned this into a competition,
we were both having fun, right?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.864
We were doing something we both liked.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.824
It did occur to me
that this whole afternoon,

14:25.908 --> 14:27.910
neither one of us checked our watch once.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.329
And if we flip this over,
one of us is gonna feel bad

14:30.329 --> 14:32.039
and it could ruin the thing.
I mean, let's face it,

14:32.039 --> 14:33.832
we don't have a ton in common,

14:33.916 --> 14:36.585
but today I saw a little bit of me in you.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.004
You can be a competitive jerk.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.048
And based on that summer-in-Paris story,

14:41.048 --> 14:43.425
you can be kind of a sensitive,
even perfumey...

14:43.509 --> 14:44.676
That'll do.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.222
Look, when you get back from your trip,
why don't we make this a thing?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.557
We'll have a wine tasting once a month.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.142
Without the competition.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.311
I'm in.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.151
Damn it!

15:03.445 --> 15:04.780
Competitive bastard.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.074
Oh, I love that kid.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.620
Time to face facts, honey.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.747
It's the grandparents' table for us.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.415
Grandpa Phil, huh?

15:15.499 --> 15:16.500
Mmm.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.002
Guess I could get used
to shaving naked at the gym.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.087
Mmm.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.464
The hardest part is our kids
aren't gonna need us anymore.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.758
And it does mean we raised them right.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.428
On the bright side, one of them
actually vacuumed the living room rug.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.972
And it looks brand new.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.474
Guys, help.
- Don't listen to her. I need you more.

15:36.854 --> 15:40.315
Shut up! Mom, I know you told me
not to buy expensive sunglasses

15:40.399 --> 15:42.901
- because I'd only lose them, but then...
- They're on your head.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.571
Oh. Cool.

15:47.698 --> 15:48.949
Hey! You find it?

15:48.949 --> 15:52.870
No, but I just realized why they call
rolling two ones with dice "snake eggs."

15:52.870 --> 15:53.996
That's snake eyes.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.622
Oh. Then what did I realize?

15:55.706 --> 15:57.249
Don't worry, I got this.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.542
What's with the bunny suit?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.669
Well, I needed a plausible
reason to be out in the yard.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.963
- It's your house.
- Okay, I like the costume.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.381
I found one.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.465
- Oh, no!
- On it.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.342
Oh!

16:07.426 --> 16:09.720
I've never seen so many pretty ones.

16:09.720 --> 16:13.432
Mama, the Easter Bunny stole my basket.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.684
That's because I'm the Easter Bandit.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.519
You were a little bad last year.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.896
I know.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.898
I have five now.

16:20.898 --> 16:25.235
Five eggs? Well, congratulations.

16:25.319 --> 16:28.822
You get to trade these five eggs

16:28.906 --> 16:32.242
for one solar path light.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.702
GIRL 2: This egg's moving.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.120
Wait, wait, wait.

16:35.204 --> 16:36.872
Wait, wait, wait.

16:36.872 --> 16:40.000
That is a magic egg.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.585
Oh.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.962
Close your eyes and make a wish.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.257
Okay.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.843
- Where's my egg?
- Disappeared. Gotta go.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.263
Uh, can I at least get a picture with you?

16:53.347 --> 16:55.057
Uh...
- Grandpa.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.935
Uh-oh.

16:59.895 --> 17:00.938
One very quick pic.

17:01.939 --> 17:04.483
Oh. Got my own finger. Sorry.

17:06.485 --> 17:08.445
Well, that's me, how did I do that?

17:08.529 --> 17:09.530
Here we go.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.990
Wait, I'm getting a call.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.035
- Who do I know in Delaware?
- Let it go to voicemail, Jim!

17:15.035 --> 17:16.119
Okay.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.038
Stop squirming, Easter Bunny.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.290
- And one...
- Three!

17:20.374 --> 17:22.334
- Got it.
- Have a good year, everybody.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.877
Be good. Especially you.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.549
What is the big emergency, Alex?

17:28.549 --> 17:31.635
I was using my Shop-Vac to give myself
a hickey to show the guys at game night.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.262
Hello, Doug.

17:33.679 --> 17:34.721
Oh.

17:34.805 --> 17:35.806
The mother.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.891
Look, Alex isn't coming to game night.

17:37.975 --> 17:40.686
She's also not cooking you ribs,
doing your laundry,

17:40.686 --> 17:42.896
or getting you an online MBA.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.022
Actually, I might finish that.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.524
I really think
we can make the dean's list.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.109
Well, we had a deal,

17:47.109 --> 17:48.777
so if she is not gonna keep up her end,

17:48.861 --> 17:50.279
I guess I'll just have to sue.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.866
Oh, no, no, no, Doug.
I think that we can work that out

17:53.866 --> 17:56.660
right here, right now.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.912
What do you think

17:59.955 --> 18:01.331
of this number?

18:01.415 --> 18:02.457
I'd like it a lot better

18:02.541 --> 18:04.126
with another zero on the end. Oh.

18:04.376 --> 18:07.379
- Yeah.
- Okay, well. I blame myself.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.091
You try to instill a sense
of responsibility in your children.

18:11.175 --> 18:14.011
And... Obviously, I failed.

18:15.304 --> 18:17.723
I don't know why I'm surprised.
Story of my life.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.349
I mean...

18:19.433 --> 18:21.143
Loveless marriage, no job...

18:23.270 --> 18:27.107
Some reason I thought that being a mother
would be the one thing I got right.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.193
Well...

18:30.194 --> 18:32.237
Could you at least wait
till Wednesday to cash this?

18:33.906 --> 18:36.116
Uh... No.

18:37.034 --> 18:40.913
Sorry about your miserable life.
I have faith that you'll get it together.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.207
Oh!
Mom!

18:43.207 --> 18:44.374
Oh, my wrist!

18:44.458 --> 18:45.542
My wrist!
Oh, my God.

18:45.626 --> 18:46.919
It's broken. He pushed me.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.796
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. I saw it.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.256
That's elder abuse.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.134
You messed with the wrong Gamma.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.638
Long story short, Doug and I
decided to call it even.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.599
And, thanks to me, not one child got bit.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.726
Are you really
gonna keep that thing?

19:02.726 --> 19:05.187
Do we always have to talk about my snake?

19:05.896 --> 19:07.105
Okay. This is too soon.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.774
She wasn't supposed to give
birth for two more weeks.

19:08.774 --> 19:10.359
Yeah, and you know,
not to be critical of women,

19:10.359 --> 19:12.861
but how hard is it just to hold it in?

19:12.945 --> 19:14.029
You know, I had that giant coffee

19:14.029 --> 19:16.073
and sat through
Manny's one-man <i>Uncle Vanya.</i>

19:16.073 --> 19:19.117
We still haven't baby proofed.
We don't have a changing table.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.411
I haven't even started painting
the mural above the baby's crib yet.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.247
Okay, so I guess there are some positives.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.831
Guys.
Oh!

19:25.332 --> 19:27.334
Lily, I'm so sorry,
I forgot you're back there.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.753
And every time you speak
it's like a ghost popping out.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.672
There's no car seat back here.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.257
Lily, you don't need a car seat.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.633
Honey, not everything is about you.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.468
For the baby.

19:36.552 --> 19:40.389
Oh. Oh, my God! It's packed away,
it's in the moving truck.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.182
Okay, can you hurry?

19:42.474 --> 19:45.894
Sorry I was late,
a smokey set up a bear trap,

19:45.978 --> 19:48.146
and I had to back off the hammer.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.357
I'll get your car seat in no time.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.441
Where are the movers?

19:52.776 --> 19:56.029
Those were no movers,
they were just men carrying boxes.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.743
Those things were broken
before we packed them, huh.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.996
Are we sure we put the car seat in right?

20:03.996 --> 20:06.832
What do you mean, we?
I don't know, it felt shaky.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.333
Oh, God, this is bad. This is really bad.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.835
We don't have diapers,
we don't have formula...

20:09.835 --> 20:10.919
I don't even know where we live.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.337
If somebody asks for an address,
what am I supposed to say?

20:12.421 --> 20:13.672
"Some new house someplace"?

20:13.672 --> 20:15.007
Guys.
Oh, my gosh.

20:15.007 --> 20:17.634
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're awful.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.512
We haven't even checked in with you,
you must be freaking out, too.

20:20.596 --> 20:23.515
No, I'm not and neither are you.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.267
This is just your process.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.437
You get hysterical,
you worry about every detail,

20:28.437 --> 20:30.355
- then you turn on each other...
- No, we don't.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.940
- Yes, we do.
- How dare you?

20:32.024 --> 20:36.153
And after all that craziness, when
it really matters the most, you...

20:36.153 --> 20:37.905
- What?
- What do we do?

20:43.744 --> 20:45.078
Our son.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.496
He's beautiful.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.249
We got this.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.293
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:54.838 --> 20:56.882
Okay, so Gloria said she set up

20:56.882 --> 20:58.467
Joe's old bassinet in our bedroom.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.094
And I think we have enough diapers
to last us till morning.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.554
Don't forget to support his head.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.182
I will. It's not my first rodeo.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.433
Oh, I can't wait to take him

21:06.517 --> 21:07.809
to his first rodeo.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.478
Okay. Um, she's asking what time

21:09.478 --> 21:11.480
she should bring everyone
by for the baby reveal.

21:11.772 --> 21:12.773
I don't know...

21:13.315 --> 21:15.275
Maybe it should just be
the four of us tonight, huh?

21:15.734 --> 21:17.152
Mmm.
Oh.

21:17.236 --> 21:21.406
You know, I think I finally realized what
this house has been missing all along.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.452
- Recessed lighting.
- Totally.
