WEBVTT

00:08.174 --> 00:10.593
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:10.677 --> 00:12.804
You get a fresh start
in a new quadrant.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.764
By my count, we're even.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.850
BOOK:
Until next time.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.644
BURNHAM:
Philippa?

00:19.728 --> 00:22.439
-Are you okay?
-Why would you ever,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.774
ever ask me
a question like that?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.777
BURNHAM:
Nobody knows if the Burn was

00:27.861 --> 00:28.945
an accident.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.572
But devastation flashed

00:30.655 --> 00:33.616
in an instant
across all known space.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.994
ADIRA:
Senna knew the algorithm
we need to find

00:36.077 --> 00:38.455
-Federation headquarters.
-These coordinates...

00:38.538 --> 00:40.457
Will take you
where you need to go.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.334
You didn't tell her about me.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.753
How are you here?

00:44.836 --> 00:46.463
I don't know.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.465
Captain, we're here.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.884
SARU:
Mr. Bryce, hail
Federation headquarters

00:50.967 --> 00:54.137
and tell them the USS Discovery
is reporting for duty.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.973
I'm Admiral Charles Vance,
Commander in Chief, Starfleet.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.517
This is my chief security
officer Lieutenant Willa.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.644
Welcome home.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.333
SARU:
In the past three weeks,
Discovery has evolved

01:23.416 --> 01:26.377
even more
than we could have imagined.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.797
Her battle scars
have been healed.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.507
Internal systems updated.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.593
Programmable matter
has been integrated

01:33.676 --> 01:35.386
with our pre-Burn technology.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.514
Even her nacelles
are now detached,

01:37.597 --> 01:39.140
improving maneuverability

01:39.224 --> 01:42.352
and enabling us to be
more efficient in flight.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.395
Her retrofit
is nearly complete.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.980
It is

01:46.064 --> 01:49.526
quite extraordinary,
the journey we have had.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.987
We are grateful to have assisted
Federation planets

01:53.071 --> 01:55.740
in the deepest regions
of the galaxy,

01:55.824 --> 01:58.868
and equally grateful to be home.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.745
We are now ready
to be of service here,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.039
in any way we can be.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.375
Welcome back to the fleet,
Discovery.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.544
And your crew?

02:07.627 --> 02:10.004
Adapting and retraining
as needed.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.215
Commander Burnham
is overseeing the process.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.591
Thank you, Captain Saru.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.926
Okay. Let's get to it.

02:15.009 --> 02:18.513
Reilling VII
needs additional shields.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.056
They're dealing
with solar flares. Kardashev?

02:20.139 --> 02:21.891
We'll bring them
some shade, sir,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.685
-if they can last a week.
-They can.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.855
Kaijur XII needs replicator
replacement technology.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.525
They've got a severe
food shortage. Captain Rahma?

02:30.608 --> 02:32.902
-That'll be your assignment.
-Aye, sir.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.613
Captain Bandra. Le Guin will
take the supply run to Na'Seth.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.781
We'll see you in two months.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.367
-Yes, Admiral.
-With respect, Admiral,

02:39.450 --> 02:42.203
given severely limited
warp travel,

02:42.287 --> 02:43.705
-if time
is of the essence...
-No question.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.248
I could use
ten of you right now.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.916
But as my only rapid responder,
I need you here.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.085
L'TEIS:
Rapid responder?

02:49.168 --> 02:52.422
-Sir.
-Discovery has an experimental

02:52.505 --> 02:55.550
advanced-drive system
that enables us

02:55.633 --> 02:57.427
to respond instantaneously
anywhere in the galaxy.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.346
Word of this critical asset

03:00.430 --> 03:03.391
will not leave this room
until I say so.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.935
Now, Argeth is on yellow alert.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.146
Our intel says
that the Emerald Chain

03:08.229 --> 03:10.899
might be making another move
in the next 12 hours.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.817
The Andorian/Orion syndicate?

03:12.901 --> 03:15.820
VANCE:
In this part
of the quadrant, yes.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.282
Osyraa and the Chain
have been pushing hard lately.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.743
I don't know what
they're after on Argeth,

03:21.826 --> 03:24.954
but they're damn sure
not gonna get it.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.332
If things heat up, I'm gonna
need you to jump, Captain.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.125
We will be ready, Admiral.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.544
Dismissed.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.469
Are we supposed to be
get new holo-PADDs, too?

03:39.552 --> 03:41.137
You already have them.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.181
(gasps softly)

03:45.183 --> 03:46.517
Cool.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.812
Okay.
This is my new favorite thing.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.066
Your new badges
also function as tricorders.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.193
And communicators

03:55.276 --> 03:57.946
and personal transporters,
but we'll get to those later.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.157
There are also upgrades
to your consoles.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.784
Check it out.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.286
Doesn't seem that different.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.622
WILLA:
Our team kept
the interface similar

04:07.705 --> 04:09.999
for ease of transition,
but once you engage...

04:10.083 --> 04:13.628
Whoa. What just happened?

04:13.711 --> 04:15.004
That's the retrofitted
programmable matter.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.006
It reads your bio-signs.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.549
Do we really need all of this?

04:18.633 --> 04:19.884
Hell yeah, we do.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.719
WILLA:
It's adaptive.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.346
Learns and adjusts
to your reflexes

04:23.429 --> 04:26.683
-to create an interface style
unique to you.
-Wow.

04:28.601 --> 04:33.439
Feels smooth... and cool.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.358
Like glass.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.194
Whoops. Didn't expect to...

04:38.277 --> 04:40.238
This isn't the mess hall.
(clears throat)

04:40.321 --> 04:41.739
Uh, bye.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.701
-(laughter)
-Apparently,
he hasn't adapted yet.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
-(alert chimes)
-Uh, Lieutenant Nilsson,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.163
we are being hailed by a vessel

04:49.247 --> 04:51.207
outside of the Federation's
distortion field.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.084
WILLA:
No one gets here
unless they know

04:53.167 --> 04:54.377
where they're going.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.796
On screen.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.966
(static crackling)

05:05.972 --> 05:08.850
(purring)

05:08.933 --> 05:10.226
(meows)

05:10.310 --> 05:12.145
Grudge?

05:21.279 --> 05:23.197
BOOK:
Hey, Michael.
I'm recording this message

05:23.281 --> 05:25.033
in case I can't tell you
in person.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.868
I was on my way
to the Bajoran exchange,

05:26.951 --> 05:28.453
when this guy
sitting next to me

05:28.536 --> 05:30.705
started talking
about a black box.

05:30.788 --> 05:34.125
And I think his black box is one
of the ones you're looking for.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.503
It's on Hunhau.
Emerald Chain territory.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.756
I'm going to do
some looking around.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.758
If things don't go well,
I'll set the ship

05:41.841 --> 05:43.259
to bring Grudge to you
if I'm not back on board

05:43.342 --> 05:44.427
in 24 hours.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.804
Now, despite her glacial
emotional process,

05:46.888 --> 05:51.601
her initial reluctance
towards you is melting away.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.603
I'll come find you two.

05:53.686 --> 05:57.190
Okay? I won't be long.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.362
This was three weeks ago.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.157
What would the black box
tell us about the Burn?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.118
Since it has a record
of any ship's last moments,

06:09.202 --> 06:11.412
every vessel destroyed
by the Burn

06:11.496 --> 06:14.415
should have stopped recording
at the same microsecond,

06:14.499 --> 06:16.459
but the two that I found
in my year here didn't.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.128
If Book found
a third one out there,

06:19.212 --> 06:20.838
and it shows the same variance,

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
that means the Burn
didn't happen all at once.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.009
-Suggesting what?
-Suggesting the Burn

06:25.093 --> 06:27.136
had a point of origin,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.972
and we can triangulate the data
from the boxes to locate it.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.225
We have got to get to Hunhau.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.018
I'm so sorry, Michael,

06:34.102 --> 06:36.437
but at the moment, we cannot.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.315
-Why?
-Well, the admiral

06:39.398 --> 06:40.983
has ordered Discovery
to be ready

06:41.067 --> 06:43.986
to jump to Argeth
within the next 12 hours.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.030
Ah. It won't take me
nearly that long.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.490
Commander.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.326
To be clear, the situation there

06:50.409 --> 06:54.205
could heat up any time
in the next 12 hours.

06:55.581 --> 06:59.877
Captain, the Federation
cannot stabilize

06:59.961 --> 07:02.171
while the cause of the Burn
remains a question.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.967
And there's a man's life
at stake.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.346
There are many lives.

07:10.429 --> 07:13.015
Today, I saw how vulnerable

07:13.099 --> 07:15.852
the Federation has become.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.689
The admiral would not be
convinced by a cat in a ship.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.276
I understand this will be
difficult, but please

07:23.359 --> 07:25.069
resume your duties
and prepare the crew

07:25.153 --> 07:27.029
for a possible jump to Argeth.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.200
Yes, sir.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.203
(door whooshes open)

07:42.670 --> 07:44.589
BURNHAM:
I can't do nothing.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.215
You're the only person
on this ship who'd say yes

07:46.299 --> 07:48.134
to going on
an unsanctioned mission.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.469
If I'm right about this box,
then I'll be bringing back proof

07:50.553 --> 07:52.221
about what caused the Burn.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.056
You're far too smart
not to realize

07:54.140 --> 07:56.058
you're dropping Saru
in the fire.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.060
He's trying to prove
his legitimacy,

07:58.144 --> 08:00.229
and his Number One is running
all around the galaxy,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.690
disobeying direct orders.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.859
Which has a very familiar ring.

08:04.942 --> 08:08.487
I'd rather regret something
I did than something I didn't.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.240
Now we're getting somewhere.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.784
Are you in or out?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.244
Georgiou?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.581
You had me
at "unsanctioned mission."

08:18.664 --> 08:20.458
(exhales)

08:20.541 --> 08:22.585
♪ ♪

08:50.154 --> 08:53.241
♪ ♪

09:20.351 --> 09:23.104
♪ ♪

09:37.159 --> 09:40.121
(original Star Trek theme
plays)

09:58.139 --> 09:59.849
Hunhau is an M-class planet.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.852
Sparsely populated. Looks like
they mainly salvage ships.

10:02.935 --> 10:06.105
Just so I'm clear,
what is our primary objective?

10:06.188 --> 10:09.191
The black box.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.860
And Book.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.528
So, what does this
cat-loving friend have

10:12.611 --> 10:14.655
that made you fall for him
like a two-year-old

10:14.739 --> 10:16.824
-on the edge of a well?
-Excuse me?

10:16.907 --> 10:19.160
The Tyler thing
ended in disaster--

10:19.243 --> 10:21.537
surprise, surprise--
so I get why

10:21.620 --> 10:23.706
you wouldn't want
to have feelings

10:23.789 --> 10:25.374
for the blob whisperer.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
I don't have feelings
for the blob whisperer.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.837
And trance worms aren't blobs.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.839
I was referring to the cat.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.051
And you seem to know
this ship pretty intimately.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.179
I spent a lot of time here.
I didn't love here or anything.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.221
I had my own ship.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.266
What?

10:42.350 --> 10:45.770
-You said "love here."
-I said "live here."

10:45.853 --> 10:48.105
-"Love here."
-You're not qualified
to judge these things.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.941
Your emotional spectrum
runs from cranky to homicidal.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.985
(echoes): And why are you
bringing up Tyler anyway?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.158
San!

11:00.076 --> 11:01.285
San!

11:01.369 --> 11:02.745
BURNHAM:
It's still raising
my heart rate.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.205
I don't even need
this caffeine right now.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.082
Espresso.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.086
(distorted):
Do you want an espresso?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.216
No.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.176
Philippa?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.096
What is going on?

11:20.179 --> 11:21.263
I know something's
happening with you.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.556
(exhales)

11:22.640 --> 11:24.433
(alert chiming)

11:29.355 --> 11:30.898
GEORGIOU:
Looks like a war zone.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.650
BURNHAM:
It was caused by the Burn.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.277
I've seen these ship graveyars
all over.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.530
The only populated area
is heavily shielded.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.740
I can't get a lock
on Book's life sign.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.492
We're being hailed.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.288
This planet's a private
salvage yard.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.916
Why don't you get our gear?

11:48.999 --> 11:50.459
What are you doing here?

11:50.543 --> 11:53.629
I must be here to buy
some salvage, meat sack.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.632
All buyers go
to the local Bajoran exchange.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.260
I'm not interested in getting
ripped off by an avatar.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.845
You insult me.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.597
My servant and I
are transporting down.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.016
Do that, and my auto-defense
systems will take you out.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.311
I decide who's authorized
to land, and when.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.647
You don't look smart enough
to run this dump.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.816
How soon before
your boss finds out

12:13.899 --> 12:16.819
I have real dilithium on board
I am willing to part with,

12:16.902 --> 12:20.197
and you're making me hover
like a peasant?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.490
Hang on.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.992
Real dilithium?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.201
What did I just say?

12:24.285 --> 12:28.164
Imbecile. You want
to let this prize go?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.708
You don't think your boss is
watching you watching me?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.668
I am losing my patience.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.337
-Well...
-Form a sentence!

12:35.421 --> 12:39.800
All right...
you're cleared to land.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.469
But I've got my eyes on you.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.137
I don't care about your eyes,

12:43.220 --> 12:45.514
unless they were dangling
from my belt.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.684
Really?

12:48.767 --> 12:50.728
He is a bully.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.606
They crumble like a cookie
when they meet a bigger one.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.525
-What is that?
-Cat collar.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.486
To find Grudge,
if she ever got lost.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.237
That cat can't get lost.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.573
It's got its own
gravitational pull.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.743
No, Book never went anywhere
without the receiver.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.369
So I reverse-engineered it.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.371
What he used to find her
will now find him.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.123
The things we do for love.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.084
Let's just go find
what we're here to find

13:14.168 --> 13:15.544
before I strangle you.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.589
(Grudge meows)

13:23.260 --> 13:26.222
-Grudge. Hello.
-(meows)

13:28.641 --> 13:30.184
On my bed?

13:31.936 --> 13:35.147
Hey there, partner.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.108
Pick you up.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.737
Um, just, full disclosure,
I'm not a cat person.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.448
So you're gonna have to
go back in the box, bud.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.242
-(mewls)
-Computer, locate Burnham.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.911
COMPUTER:
Commander Burnham
is not on board.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.999
Did you eat her?

13:55.501 --> 14:00.130
Computer, scan shuttle bay
for Cleveland Booker's ship.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.423
Unable to locate.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.969
-Come here, kitty.
-(mewling)

14:05.052 --> 14:06.887
Come...

14:06.971 --> 14:09.056
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.891
No-no-no-no, there's...

14:10.975 --> 14:12.393
(laughing)

14:12.476 --> 14:13.936
-You got to come here, bud.
-(purring)

14:14.019 --> 14:15.729
You got to go back in the box.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.606
(sighs)

14:17.690 --> 14:19.483
I don't like you.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.449
BURNHAM:
Book said he already found
a black box,

14:27.533 --> 14:29.994
but if you see any others whie
we're down there, grab them.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.329
GEORGIOU:
Out from under
the idiot's nose?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.206
Child's play.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.168
TOLOR:
No merchandise
until I get your dilithium.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.922
And you don't get your weapons
back until you leave.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.592
If I wanted to kill you,
I wouldn't need a weapon.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.135
And from the looks
of this place,

14:46.218 --> 14:47.636
they'd name a holiday after me.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.805
So who put you in charge?

14:49.888 --> 14:52.016
I'm Osyraa's nephew.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.642
This is her territory.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.978
-What makes you think...
-What makes you think?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.771
Oh, don't tell me
you have actual brain matter,

14:57.855 --> 14:59.523
or whatever nephews have.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.483
BURNHAM:
Where do you get your help from?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.319
All these people.
Beta VI?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.321
Marin-Jira?

15:05.404 --> 15:08.198
They owe Osyraa.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.493
They work for us forever.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.828
It's pretty simple.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.497
I'd love to meet this Osyraa.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.499
She sounds like
my kind of girl.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.335
We're going over there.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.973
She's looking for
self-sealing stem bolts

15:33.057 --> 15:35.017
from the late 24th century.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.560
Down there.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.062
Hang a right at the entrance.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.688
Next to the plasma coils.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.232
You should be able to find
what you're looking for.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.362
GEORGIOU:
I'm particularly interested
in any

15:46.445 --> 15:49.198
pre-2400 items.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.492
These ships are old as dirt.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.952
There's plenty
of good scrap in 'em.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.120
Here.

15:56.246 --> 16:00.542
Please. Half of those parts
didn't even exist in that era.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.879
Now, this has all
its original parts.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.714
930 years old,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.050
and it still works.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.760
Don't touch.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.349
(meow sound over device)

16:15.432 --> 16:17.267
TOLOR:
Move it.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.895
Captain, there's more
over there.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.063
Let's go.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.901
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Sector Six
arriving workers.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.278
Report immediately
to Melting Forge Three

16:28.362 --> 16:32.199
for mandatory security
protocols and implantation.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.034
RYN:
I'm sorry, I have to do this.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.252
Try to relax,
it'll only hurt for a minute.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.212
Get off me, traitor.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.802
-LAI: Ah.
-(clang)

16:51.885 --> 16:54.096
Hey, come on, watch
that elbow, Lai.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.723
I'm good.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.434
Not since that regulator tried
to separate you from it.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.394
BOOK:
I got this, okay?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
Hey, Lai,
I found some Tala bark.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.275
I thought it might help
with your elbow.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.485
Anything from you is
nothing I need.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.656
Ryn, let him go.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.160
They think I want to be
this guy.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.955
They know Osyraa will kill you
slow if you say no.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.749
Just try and not
take it personal.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.584
We're all just trying to...

17:26.879 --> 17:27.713
RYN:
Who is that?

17:27.796 --> 17:31.717
Um... friend.
Just keep your eyes down.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.681
Hey!

17:37.765 --> 17:39.349
Drop it!

17:39.433 --> 17:40.601
What?

17:40.684 --> 17:42.352
Show me.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.521
Hey, come on, take it easy.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.483
TOLOR:
You! Shut up.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.112
Are you stealing from me?

17:52.196 --> 17:54.656
It's just a water ration.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.826
Just a water ration.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.830
We work hard to bring you
all the water you need.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.373
I guess that's not enough.

18:07.711 --> 18:08.670
Tolor, please...

18:08.754 --> 18:10.881
(grunts)

18:17.596 --> 18:19.348
TOLOR:
Open the door.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.895
We haven't tested
the new system updates

18:24.978 --> 18:26.980
on the perimeter pylons.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.275
Maybe you'll go free,
or you might not.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.736
There's only one way
to find out.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.868
-Three...
-(hand cannon fires)

18:39.952 --> 18:41.620
LAI:
Please don't.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.580
-Two...
-(cannon fires)

18:43.664 --> 18:45.082
One!

18:48.627 --> 18:49.837
TOLOR:
Faster.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.048
(screaming)

18:53.131 --> 18:54.174
Faster!

19:07.980 --> 19:10.566
I guess it does work.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.157
Get back to work.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.212
GRAY:
I don't get it.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.631
Why are you shutting yourself
away in this goldfish bowl?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.091
ADIRA:
I'm working.

19:36.174 --> 19:39.720
There's a basketball court
out there, and bocce.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.431
-And fencing.
-Enticing.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.475
Adira, we're on this amazing
moving world,

19:45.559 --> 19:47.769
and I've only seen
where you sleep, work and eat.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.771
And these are all
vital functions.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.941
Could we make a new memory,
please?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.318
STAMETS:
Who moved the intermix pods?

19:54.401 --> 19:57.487
Ergonomics don't make any sense.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.951
That's way above
my pay grade.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.119
Talk to the admiral.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.538
Yes, well, the admiral
expects us to jump

20:06.622 --> 20:08.165
to Argeth at any time.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.792
This place is in chaos.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.419
Nothing's where it's
supposed to be.

20:12.502 --> 20:16.131
Oh, these crazy kids
and their chaos.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.593
Linus, don't do that.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.305
Sorry. New badge. Hmm?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.644
The spore drive's new
and improved.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.604
I redesigned it so you won't
have to use those shunts.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.578
Well, it's a lot
more comfortable.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.997
A little gooey.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.707
Nanogel.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.627
It acts as a quantum transducer.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.545
Slips right off.
No residue.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.926
Thank you.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.643
GEORGIOU:
His death was efficient.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.270
TOLOR:
Thank you.
And now you know what happens

21:12.354 --> 21:14.356
when you break the rules.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.899
GEORGIOU:
So I saw.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.819
A little messy,
but I assume that's the point.

21:18.902 --> 21:21.405
I want to buy the tech
for that fencing system.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.408
Proprietary.
Owned by Osyraa.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.576
-Not for sale.
-How disappointing.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.205
How do you control
the perimeter fence?

21:30.288 --> 21:33.375
-From your office?
-I can't say.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.543
The controls are in your pocket.
I know because

21:34.626 --> 21:36.086
you keep touching them.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.714
Servant, we're shopping.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.049
Uh, I want
those magnetic interlocks

21:41.133 --> 21:43.051
and two plasma conduits.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.220
Ma'am, you also wanted
warp coils

21:45.303 --> 21:47.389
-to melt down for cortenum.
-Mm-hmm.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.433
-Buy me some time.
-Okay, go.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.853
What kind of rubbish
do you have down here?

21:52.936 --> 21:55.397
TOLOR:
Well, we've got some
tritanium power coils...

21:55.480 --> 21:57.065
Bring me more.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.650
At the back shelves.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.407
(Burnham sighs)

22:05.490 --> 22:07.367
WOMAN (over P.A.):
45 minutes to shift change.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.077
(whispering):
You weren't supposed to come.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.581
The hell I wasn't. God.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.708
And you sent
a passive-aggressive holo, so...

22:14.791 --> 22:17.794
What? I sent
a passive-passive holo,

22:17.878 --> 22:19.796
which said, "I'm coming here."
It didn't say, "Come here, too."

22:19.880 --> 22:22.424
Oh, I didn't need to.
That was the aggressive part.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.925
I got to get you out of here.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.927
You can't.
I'll get myself out.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.306
If I cross that perimeter,

22:29.389 --> 22:31.099
what happened to that guy
who ran happens to me.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.768
I know.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.145
I got the black box.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.189
Okay?

22:37.272 --> 22:38.440
It's in the wall of my quarters.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.275
You just need to get it and go.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.943
I'm not leaving you.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.238
You see that clock?

22:45.322 --> 22:47.115
43 minutes
until the shift change.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.242
Then I'm in one of those ships
up top for a week.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.285
There's no time.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.620
43 minutes is plenty of time.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.915
Osyraa breaks people.
Understand?

22:54.998 --> 22:56.166
Ryn, the Andorian, he was born

22:56.249 --> 22:57.501
into the Emerald Chain.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.794
He tried to rally
the people against them.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.295
People were beginning
to listen.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.631
So she hacked off his antennae
and made him the guy

23:02.714 --> 23:05.008
that plants this thing.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.134
Now he's a pariah.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.679
BURNHAM:
We are gonna get you
and everybody out.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.099
And I have an idea.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.433
(whispering):
Remember Iso VII?

23:15.060 --> 23:16.978
What's taking them so long?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.980
I pay her to be thorough.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.821
Found what we were looking for.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.823
They were buried pretty deep.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.993
Uh, I'll need 40 minutes to
properly clean and inspect them.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.995
40 minutes? Huh.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.789
That's a lifetime.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.874
-(loud crash)
-TOLOR: What the hell?!

23:37.958 --> 23:40.502
Get a drone to stay on them.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.506
What do you idiots think
you're doing?

23:51.972 --> 23:53.849
Let's do a pre-check
on oxygen and nitrogen levels

23:53.932 --> 23:55.559
-in main bay.
-Uh, what about the...

23:55.642 --> 23:57.853
New stabilization system?
Just about to get to that.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.564
So, if it overloads
when Commander Stamets engages,

24:00.647 --> 24:02.816
just lock it down
and reroute to containment.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.861
-Got it?
-Okay.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.571
-Ensign Tilly.
-Ah-- Sir.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.531
Uh, sorry. I was just
re-running some tests

24:09.614 --> 24:10.907
with the new
spore drive interface,

24:10.991 --> 24:12.868
in case we need to jump quickly.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.704
I appreciate your diligence.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.206
Might I speak with you
privately?

24:20.792 --> 24:23.545
It's about Michael, right?

24:23.628 --> 24:26.214
I was hoping against all logic
you could explain her absence.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.258
(chuckles)
Sorry, no. Uh...

24:28.341 --> 24:30.218
Came into my room
and Grudge was there, and...

24:30.302 --> 24:32.387
-(sighs)
-Sure she has a reason

24:32.471 --> 24:34.681
for keeping us both in the dark.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.184
Commander Burnham left

24:37.267 --> 24:41.354
to pursue a mission of her own
against my direct orders.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.065
Oh, shit. Sh-- shit, shit.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.525
Sorry.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.402
My sentiments exactly.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.615
I will be honest, Ensign.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.075
I have not felt
this mistrusting of her

24:54.159 --> 24:57.412
since we served on the Shenzhou.

24:57.495 --> 25:02.584
I assumed, after all
we have endured together,

25:02.667 --> 25:04.586
that this feeling
would never return.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.922
Sir, you know Michael

25:07.005 --> 25:09.758
is one of the people that I love
m-most in this world,

25:09.841 --> 25:13.220
but she made a choice,

25:13.303 --> 25:16.473
and now because of that,
you don't have one.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.600
You have to tell the admiral.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.229
I expected you
to try talking me out of it.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.439
I know. Me, too, but...

25:24.522 --> 25:26.441
Discovery still has
a lot to prove,

25:26.524 --> 25:27.984
and if Admiral Vance finds out

25:28.068 --> 25:29.736
and you're not the one
who told him?

25:29.819 --> 25:33.073
The entire crew will get
painted with the same brush.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.454
That is astute, Ensign.

25:39.537 --> 25:43.583
I might've done the same thing
in her shoes.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.502
Just for the record.

25:46.544 --> 25:51.174
For the record,
I do not believe you would have.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.059
I think I see tritanium
over there.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.645
GEORGIOU:
Good. Maybe I'll keep
you around, servant.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.003
How long before they notice?

26:28.086 --> 26:30.213
(alarm blaring)

26:35.260 --> 26:36.720
Get back to work.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.098
You know what to do?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.685
BURNHAM:
How many weapons
can you build from this?

26:43.768 --> 26:44.728
We'll have time for one.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.731
There we go.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.275
One blast, then we'll have
the perimeter controls.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.068
I love me.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.236
(sighs)
Let's go.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.363
REGULATOR:
Freeze!

26:55.447 --> 26:59.034
Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

27:04.622 --> 27:06.374
I told as many of the others
as I could.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.543
I don't know if
they believed me, but I tried.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.003
You did good, Ryn.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.047
Here.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.382
I got it. The black box.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.092
Who are these friends of yours?

27:16.176 --> 27:18.720
Very handy, excellent friends.

27:18.803 --> 27:19.929
Okay.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.598
Five minutes
till shit gets real.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.935
What if I can't do this?

27:26.019 --> 27:30.273
You got those
for standing up to the Chain.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.400
You got this.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.695
All you got to do is, uh, run,

27:35.779 --> 27:37.864
and you and I, my friend,
are getting out of here.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.617
All of us, on a transport ship.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.833
SARU: There is no doubt
Commander Burnham made

27:48.917 --> 27:51.211
a serious error in judgment.

27:51.294 --> 27:54.381
But you can be assured that
the absence of our Number One

27:54.464 --> 27:56.091
will not impact
our ability to respond

27:56.174 --> 27:58.760
to any potential conflict
on Argeth.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.221
-WILLA: The Cuyahoga's back.
-VANCE: Well, make sure

28:01.304 --> 28:03.348
they clear the ship
before doing the baryon sweep.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.520
I'm glad to hear you can cope

28:08.603 --> 28:10.105
without your Number One,
Captain,

28:10.188 --> 28:11.940
because we are having trouble
keeping our head above water

28:12.023 --> 28:14.609
with old-fashioned diplomacy.

28:14.692 --> 28:17.112
Emerald Chain
has pulled out of talks.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.447
Stand by to jump on my orders.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.616
We will begin preparations,
Admiral.

28:21.699 --> 28:23.576
Dismissed.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.293
GEORGIOU:
You think you're two steps
ahead of us, but you're not.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.629
I don't know why
you're even bothering.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.756
I keep telling you,
you're too stupid.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.469
You didn't come here
for salvage.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.138
(grunts)

28:43.221 --> 28:47.809
(chuckles) At this point, I'm
almost proud it occurred to you.

28:47.892 --> 28:52.313
SEARCHING REGULATOR:
Sir, I found what you're
looking for.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.276
30 units of pure dilithium.

28:56.359 --> 28:59.446
(Tolor chuckles)

28:59.529 --> 29:01.614
Not as smart as you thought.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.616
Now who's the meat sack?

29:03.700 --> 29:06.327
That would be a bad idea,
to fire that weapon.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.163
If Osyraa sniffed out
what we had on our ship

29:08.246 --> 29:09.998
and wanted to know our story,
she would kill you

29:10.081 --> 29:11.166
for killing us.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.292
(alarm blaring)

29:12.375 --> 29:14.836
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Sector Five worker,

29:14.919 --> 29:16.129
report for shift change.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.881
Let's go!

29:17.964 --> 29:19.299
(workers shouting)

29:25.263 --> 29:27.640
-Stay with me! Let's go!
-Get to the ship!

29:27.724 --> 29:30.477
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Unauthorized perimeter door
accessed.

29:34.147 --> 29:37.025
(screaming)

29:39.402 --> 29:42.197
Go! Go!

29:46.451 --> 29:48.411
(grunting)

29:54.626 --> 29:57.003
RYN:
The perimeter fence is still on.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.047
They'll come through.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.217
(grunting)

30:16.523 --> 30:18.107
GEORGIOU:
San!

30:27.951 --> 30:29.786
BURNHAM:
Get the controller!

30:29.869 --> 30:32.038
Get the controller!

30:33.957 --> 30:36.376
We can't stay here.

30:36.459 --> 30:38.294
(Tolor and Burnham grunting)

30:46.761 --> 30:48.054
(wheezes)

30:49.472 --> 30:51.099
GEORGIOU:
Got it.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.893
You got to be kidding me.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.145
I was just starting
to enjoy myself.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.318
Let's go.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.612
-Let's go, go, go!
The perimeter's down!
-Come on! This way!

31:04.696 --> 31:06.406
-BOOK: On me. Let's move!
-We can make it.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.157
Come on!

31:08.241 --> 31:10.118
(panting)

31:10.201 --> 31:11.119
-Get on the transport ship!
-Come on!

31:11.202 --> 31:12.829
-Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
-Go on! Go on!

31:12.912 --> 31:14.622
-Come on!
-Come on!

31:14.706 --> 31:17.333
(indistinct shouting)

31:17.417 --> 31:18.626
-Come on!
-Bring him down!

31:18.710 --> 31:21.254
-Book!
-Come on. To the ship.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.464
(screams)

31:23.548 --> 31:24.924
Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.384
-(screaming)
-I got you. I got you.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.761
Hey, stay with me.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.471
Hey. Hey, hey.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.932
I got you. I got you.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.310
Stay with me. Okay?

31:36.352 --> 31:37.353
(shouts)

31:40.773 --> 31:42.150
Ryn, Ryn.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.110
Hey, hey. Hey.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.528
-Hey, look at me.
-Get out of here.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.779
Come on, come on. Stay with me.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.323
(indistinct shouting)

32:14.265 --> 32:15.683
(whoops)

32:23.775 --> 32:25.610
(grunts)

32:26.778 --> 32:27.904
Come on.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.618
(Book shouts indistinctly)

32:35.620 --> 32:37.330
BOOK:
Michael!

32:37.413 --> 32:39.082
Michael!

32:39.165 --> 32:40.833
I got you.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.252
(Ryn gasping)

32:46.464 --> 32:47.382
Stay with me. Okay?

32:47.465 --> 32:49.133
Stay with me.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.229
GEORGIOU:
Salvage this,
you son of a bitch.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.213
♪ ♪

33:38.349 --> 33:40.560
I've alerted sickbay
on Discovery.

33:44.897 --> 33:47.233
BOOK:
The black box I promised.

33:49.652 --> 33:53.072
I hope it helps you find
what you're looking for.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.411
(quietly):
Thank you.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.638
So...

34:17.722 --> 34:21.601
we are going to talk about
what happened back there.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.478
You could have gotten us killed.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.646
Don't you think I know that?

34:25.730 --> 34:28.191
Then tell me what's going on.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.655
You don't know, do you?

34:37.408 --> 34:39.577
Philippa, how long
has this been happening?

34:40.578 --> 34:42.455
A couple of weeks.

34:42.538 --> 34:44.373
And it's getting more severe.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.337
You could have come to me.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.797
I could have helped.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.841
Until I understand
what's going on,

34:53.925 --> 34:55.676
there's nothing to ask for.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.429
That's not true. Discovery
is filled with people...

34:58.513 --> 35:00.515
You will tell no one.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.850
This isn't the Terran universe.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.352
(scoffs)

35:04.435 --> 35:07.939
A vulnerability
is not a death sentence.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.195
You're not alone.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.156
We'll get through this.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.994
Trust me.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.247
I remember
another Michael Burnham

35:24.330 --> 35:26.332
telling me to trust her.

35:27.166 --> 35:32.004
She looked
just as sincere as you do now.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.132
And we know how that ended.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.739
(indistinct chatter)

36:09.125 --> 36:12.128
You're talking to yourself.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.423
I don't think you're crazy,

36:15.506 --> 36:16.966
for what it's worth.

36:17.049 --> 36:20.595
But I'm... curious.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.722
You won't believe me.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.644
You have no idea
what goes on around here.

36:28.728 --> 36:29.729
(quiet laugh)

36:29.812 --> 36:31.606
Okay.

36:31.689 --> 36:34.901
Let me just say there's
no head injuries.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.986
Okay.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.284
I was talking to my boyfriend.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.119
He's Trill.

36:45.202 --> 36:47.371
I got my symbiont from him.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.958
When he died.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.794
Um...

36:53.878 --> 36:55.129
my understanding

36:55.212 --> 36:58.049
of Trill is that...

36:58.132 --> 37:01.260
you're supposed to be carrying
his memories, not...

37:01.344 --> 37:03.512
His soul?

37:03.596 --> 37:06.432
Yeah, I-I don't know how it
happened this way, either.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.976
Maybe because we were so close.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.978
Well, I'm, um...

37:11.062 --> 37:15.149
filling in the blanks a bit,
but it sounds like

37:15.232 --> 37:18.527
you're holding
onto someone you love.

37:18.611 --> 37:22.323
And I did that

37:22.406 --> 37:25.701
with Hugh while he was gone.

37:27.161 --> 37:30.957
Before he died,
I thought of life and death

37:31.040 --> 37:33.042
as this linear thing

37:33.125 --> 37:36.837
with a distinct
beginning and end.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.173
And now I know

37:39.257 --> 37:42.885
life will always surprise me.

37:42.969 --> 37:46.555
So... if you tell me

37:46.639 --> 37:50.309
that he's still with you--
what's his name?

37:50.393 --> 37:52.520
-Gray.
-Gray.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.607
I believe you.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.364
He...

38:03.447 --> 38:05.866
says I need to make friends.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.411
But I don't know.

38:08.494 --> 38:12.373
Well, he realizes
you have a lot to give.

38:12.456 --> 38:16.002
What, you think I have
something to give?

38:16.085 --> 38:18.212
Are you kidding?

38:18.295 --> 38:20.214
You can accomplish things

38:20.297 --> 38:22.717
none of us can even imagine.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.721
Including me, and I've
imagined more than most.

38:26.804 --> 38:30.057
You're kind of, like,
the bomb, huh?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.019
I was until you showed up.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.938
(laughs)

38:36.022 --> 38:38.858
-I like this guy.
-(laughs)

38:39.859 --> 38:43.279
He, um... he says he likes you.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.865
Well, he's clearly a genius.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.159
(laughing)

38:58.335 --> 39:00.796
I think I can help you
with this.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.425
How's he doing?

39:04.508 --> 39:06.093
Any news?

39:06.177 --> 39:09.096
Dr. Pollard said it would
take some time, but, uh...

39:09.180 --> 39:10.973
he's gonna make it.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.266
I'm glad.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.936
And you?

39:16.020 --> 39:18.064
Yeah, I mean,

39:18.147 --> 39:20.274
device is gone for good.

39:20.357 --> 39:22.777
Neck's a little stiff,
but she said the swelling

39:22.860 --> 39:25.279
should go down in a few days,
I hope.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.120
Time to face
the firing squad, huh?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.664
Yeah.

39:35.748 --> 39:38.250
We'll see.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.135
Look, uh...

39:48.219 --> 39:51.764
I'm sorry I put you
in this position.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.849
You didn't.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.354
I hope you don't regret it.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.691
How could I?

40:10.699 --> 40:12.701
(turbolift stops)

40:15.287 --> 40:17.331
Thank you.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.170
Thank you for saving my life.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.303
I'm glad I found you.

40:31.387 --> 40:35.015
We always find each other.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.479
Oh.

40:40.563 --> 40:41.647
(both exhale)

40:41.730 --> 40:44.525
This is not the science lab.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.527
(huffs)

40:46.610 --> 40:49.697
(both laugh)

40:49.780 --> 40:52.074
We have these new badges.

40:58.914 --> 41:00.916
♪ ♪

41:16.390 --> 41:18.392
(laughs)

41:20.603 --> 41:24.023
So we have Adira
to thank for this?

41:24.106 --> 41:27.401
God, I hated those things.

41:27.484 --> 41:29.904
I hated them more.

41:29.987 --> 41:32.865
It's amazing.

41:32.948 --> 41:35.492
And she's only 16.

41:37.494 --> 41:39.455
She trusted me today.

41:39.538 --> 41:41.373
And that's bad, why?

41:41.457 --> 41:46.253
Because I've never had time
to be a tween's confidante.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.713
(laughing):
Paul.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.882
She's not gonna invite you
to her slumber party.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.136
Why do you think
you reached out to her today?

41:54.220 --> 41:58.432
Because she's brilliant and...

41:58.515 --> 42:00.601
seemed to have
a hard time with people

42:00.684 --> 42:02.937
or doing anything besides work.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.396
Remind you of anyone?

42:08.317 --> 42:11.111
And...

42:11.195 --> 42:13.656
because she loves someone
who died.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.533
But isn't gone.

42:18.994 --> 42:20.955
I never...

42:21.038 --> 42:23.791
ever thought I'd meet anyone

42:23.874 --> 42:25.417
who knew what that was like.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.836
And...

42:27.920 --> 42:30.965
I guess I'm grateful to her.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.842
And I want to help her somehow.

42:35.427 --> 42:37.930
And she has no idea.

42:40.724 --> 42:42.434
So tell her.

42:44.937 --> 42:49.066
Your job is
to follow orders, Captain.

42:49.149 --> 42:51.652
But I need to rely
on your judgment.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.488
Commander Burnham's mission
was 100% rogue

42:54.571 --> 42:57.324
but also an unexpected
opportunity.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.159
If asked, I may have deemed

42:59.243 --> 43:01.328
the intel worth the risk.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.579
Noted, sir.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.041
VANCE:
Commander Burnham, why don't

43:06.125 --> 43:08.043
you tell me
what I'm about to say?

43:08.127 --> 43:10.045
The source of the Burn
is not an issue

43:10.129 --> 43:13.007
-that you have
the luxury of pursuing.
-Correct.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.968
Because every day you have
a hundred fires you have

43:16.051 --> 43:17.886
-to put out.
-Correct.

43:17.970 --> 43:20.347
And I disobeyed a direct order

43:20.431 --> 43:22.891
and undermined
my captain's authority.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.351
And yours.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.936
Correct.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.396
For a hot second there,

43:27.479 --> 43:29.106
it looked like Discovery
may have had

43:29.189 --> 43:31.066
to engage with the Emerald Chain

43:31.150 --> 43:32.860
without her Number One.

43:32.943 --> 43:35.195
Did you think about the position
you put your captain in?

43:35.279 --> 43:36.864
You put Starfleet in?

43:36.947 --> 43:39.033
As far as I'm concerned,

43:39.116 --> 43:40.701
when you jumped
through that wormhole,

43:40.784 --> 43:41.869
you were doing your job.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.538
You're here now.

43:44.621 --> 43:47.041
And every mission,
you start from zero.

43:47.124 --> 43:49.335
The only reason
you're not in the brig

43:49.418 --> 43:51.503
is because you saved lives.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.047
Am I being clear,

43:53.130 --> 43:54.381
Commander Burnham?

43:54.465 --> 43:57.384
Very clear, sir.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.013
Permission to speak?

44:01.096 --> 44:03.474
It had better be
the best thing I've ever heard.

44:04.850 --> 44:07.561
For the last year,

44:07.644 --> 44:10.856
I have spent every single day

44:10.939 --> 44:14.860
searching for the source
of the Burn.

44:14.943 --> 44:19.531
Until we solve the mystery
of how it happened and why,

44:19.615 --> 44:24.036
I believe the Federation
will never be...

44:24.119 --> 44:26.747
can never be...

44:26.830 --> 44:28.832
brought back together again.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.006
Well, we'll see what
your intel brings, Commander.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.592
I will leave it
up to you, Captain,

44:38.675 --> 44:41.804
to determine the consequences
of her insubordination.

44:41.887 --> 44:44.431
Thank you, Admiral.

44:58.153 --> 45:00.155
I am sorry.

45:01.990 --> 45:04.952
The admiral made
some excellent points.

45:06.745 --> 45:08.705
And I will continue to reflect

45:08.789 --> 45:11.625
on the way I have
handled all this.

45:11.708 --> 45:15.629
We both made mistakes.

45:15.712 --> 45:19.133
I was particularly disappointed.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.927
-That was...
-While I agree

45:22.010 --> 45:24.805
with your intentions,

45:24.888 --> 45:27.683
the decision
I am now forced to make

45:27.766 --> 45:30.436
comes down to one thing
and one thing only, Commander.

45:30.519 --> 45:32.604
It's not about your skill.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.357
It's not about your ability.

45:35.441 --> 45:38.152
It is about trust.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.030
In your defense,

45:42.114 --> 45:43.824
you were clear
in your ambivalence

45:43.907 --> 45:46.493
when I asked you
to be my Number One.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.996
In my desire to...

45:49.079 --> 45:52.458
return to a sense of...

45:52.541 --> 45:54.460
things as they were.

45:54.543 --> 45:56.879
But as we keep learning...

45:59.423 --> 46:02.634
...things are not as they were.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.636
No, they're not.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.639
I take no pleasure in this.

46:09.766 --> 46:11.685
But...

46:11.768 --> 46:13.854
as of now,

46:13.937 --> 46:17.024
you are relieved of your duty
as my Number One.

46:17.107 --> 46:18.859
You will restrict yourself

46:18.942 --> 46:22.696
to chief science officer
duties only.

46:31.121 --> 46:33.123
Saru?

46:38.629 --> 46:41.715
You're doing the right thing.

46:49.765 --> 46:52.392
One day...

46:52.476 --> 46:54.561
we will find the answers

46:54.645 --> 46:58.524
we are all looking for, Michael.
