WEBVTT

00:45.879 --> 00:47.339
Thank you, Colonel!

00:50.259 --> 00:53.345
Sorry. Hey, come on.
Coming through! Coming through!

00:53.428 --> 00:54.888
-That's for you.
-All I'm saying is,

00:54.972 --> 00:57.516
I can't remember the last time
Chickie paid for a beer.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.184
Wait, are you calling me cheap?

00:59.268 --> 01:02.062
No, he's calling you a freeloader.
Now, where's my change?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.147
Thank you.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.399
Are you shittin' me?

01:05.482 --> 01:06.608
Hey, Noodle.

01:06.692 --> 01:10.279
When I get off a ship flushed with cash,
who picks up more tabs than me?

01:10.362 --> 01:11.613
-No one.
-Bingo.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.199
But you haven't been on a ship
in three months. Do the math.

01:14.283 --> 01:17.077
Can't even go to the Shilling no more,
'cause he ain't paid his tab!

01:17.160 --> 01:19.329
Hey, that's bullshit!
I can't go to the Shilling no more,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.331
because that's where
the Keenan brothers hang out.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.750
They still mad about you and their sister?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.378
I don't know. And I don't wanna find out.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.505
Hey, who put this shit on?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.424
I did. I love this song!

01:30.507 --> 01:31.550
I love this song too.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.510
-This song sucks.
-It's not great.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.305
Hey, Colonel! One more round!

01:36.388 --> 01:39.141
Forget it, Donohue.
You're three weeks behind on your tab.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.268
This ain't on me! It's on Brendan!

01:42.269 --> 01:43.645
Lucky boy!

01:44.396 --> 01:46.023
And keep 'em comin'!

01:52.029 --> 01:53.238
Hey.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.742
Get your ass out of bed, you lazy bum!
Come on.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.994
-Fuck. I'm up.
-You're not up!

01:59.077 --> 02:02.915
11:30 mass began ten minutes ago,
for Chris-- Get the hell up, Chick!

02:02.998 --> 02:05.042
I went there five o'clock last night.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.377
Bullshit.
Your mother and I were at the five.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.047
Look at you, sleeping your life away.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.508
I'll stay awake when I'm dead.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.260
For God sake's, Chickie.
Church started already!

02:15.344 --> 02:16.345
Get up!

03:13.068 --> 03:15.654
-What are you doing tonight, Chickie?
-What do you think he's doing?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.573
It's the same every night with him.

03:17.656 --> 03:21.285
He's off on a toot. He sleeps all day.
He's "Good Time Chickie." Must be fun.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.786
Oh, my-- Here we go again.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.581
You know, being a merchant mariner
ain't no pleasure cruise, okay?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.082
-Yeah.
-It's backbreaking work.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.166
Boohoo, Chickie.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.711
So this is my time to kick back
and relax a little,

03:31.211 --> 03:33.380
like a professor on summer break.

03:33.463 --> 03:37.551
Oh, yeah. You're a professor,
and your grandmother's Miss America.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.469
Come on. Do we gotta start this again?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.763
You know what? It's my house.
He's gonna live by my rules!

03:41.847 --> 03:44.558
He wants to be a drunk and sleep all day.
Maybe he should get his own place!

03:44.641 --> 03:45.934
Fine. I'll move out.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.477
That's a waste of money, Chickie.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.521
You're out to sea more than half the year.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.732
Catherine, you gotta stop babying the boy.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.443
When I was your age, I had two jobs.
I had three kids. I had a wife.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.528
So it's my fault
you knocked up Ma in high school?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.488
-Hey!
-Chickie!

03:58.572 --> 04:00.782
We got pregnant after we were married!

04:00.866 --> 04:02.492
Come on, Ma.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.580
You got married in January.
Gerard was born in June. It don't add up.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.124
-It was a leap year.
-A what?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.709
What does that mean?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.253
Gerard came early. That's how it adds up.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.963
Very common in first deliveries.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.466
Johnny Knopf's dead.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.306
-No.
-I just ran into Judy Byrne.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.725
She's best friends with his sister, Mo.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.068
But he just got there.

04:37.819 --> 04:42.533
Well, you know, the family can be proud.
He died a hero, that boy.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.785
How do you know?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.247
How do I know?

04:48.914 --> 04:51.041
Because he died for his country.
That's how I know.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.793
For his country to do what?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.504
Hey, Christine. This ain't the time.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.756
Well, when's gonna be the time?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.591
We don't even know why
we're fightin' over there.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.510
For Chrissakes.
Has it ever occurred to you

05:01.593 --> 05:03.178
our country knows very well
what they're doing,

05:03.262 --> 05:04.471
they just haven't told you yet?

05:04.555 --> 05:07.558
LBJ's lying to us!
He won't even admit it's a war!

05:07.641 --> 05:10.602
-Yeah. Everybody's lying, Christine.
-They are lying!

05:10.686 --> 05:12.020
Christine, that's enough.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.231
Yeah, Ma, it is enough.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.359
Eight kids from this neighborhood
are dead already.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.820
How many's it gonna take
before you all wake up?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.145
The young mother's daughter was shot

05:53.228 --> 05:55.564
while quietly riding a bicycle
with her father.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.859
On a public lane, in a little village.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.195
In the warm sun on a beautiful day.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.114
She will be dead in an hour…

06:05.032 --> 06:06.992
Knopf wasn't even supposed to be there.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.996
He and his old man signed a waiver
so he could enlist at 17.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.207
Jesus. What the hell was his rush?

06:13.707 --> 06:17.544
His rush was
he was doing his patriotic duty.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.796
You make a very good point.

06:22.758 --> 06:26.220
This is bullshit.
They should not be showing this on TV.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.388
This would not fly back in my day.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.849
There was no TV back in your day.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.268
Yeah. And we were better for it.

06:34.895 --> 06:39.525
War is not a TV show. It's too real-life.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.236
And the American people
can't handle real life?

06:42.319 --> 06:45.614
No, they can't.
And they shouldn't have to.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.201
Bringing dead soldiers,
guys with no arms and legs,

06:49.284 --> 06:50.410
into our living rooms

06:50.494 --> 06:52.162
is not helping no one.

06:52.246 --> 06:57.292
If they had showed
the Battle of the Bulge on TV,

06:57.376 --> 06:58.919
we'd have quit after three days.

07:00.003 --> 07:05.175
We didn't. We took our licks,
but we pushed 'em back, and we won.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.637
It was a different time.
It was a different war, Colonel.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.394
What are you selling, Noodle?
You saying you're on their side?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.814
I'll throw you right the hell outta here.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.316
Jesus, Colonel.
You got a short fuse today, huh?

07:21.900 --> 07:25.696
I ain't got a short fuse.
You just don't know when you lit it.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.587
God, I hate these things.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.756
Why can't they just have a funeral
and get it over with?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.509
This just drags it out
and makes it worse for everyone.

07:47.593 --> 07:48.969
Asshole.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.513
The wake is for the family.
It's not about you.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.725
It gives 'em time to grieve and shit
before they put him in the dirt.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.978
You hit it on the head.
We need wakes. They're important.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.814
It's very good for everyone to grieve.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.860
Jesus, Danny. Don't you ever
have an opinion that you stick to?

08:05.527 --> 08:07.779
-You just blow with the wind, don't you?
-No.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.449
I just try to be open-minded
to everybody's point of view.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.409
Like the way dogs are.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.328
"Like the way dogs are"?

08:15.162 --> 08:18.040
-What's he saying?
-I'm just saying dogs don't judge.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.628
The Minogues got a telegram this morning.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.922
Tommy's MIA.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.678
Come on.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.590
Goddamn it.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.552
The ball's dropping in ten minutes.
We're gonna miss it, Chick.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.471
Don't worry about it, Tommy.
It'll drop again next year!

09:14.555 --> 09:16.014
Yeah, but I've never seen it.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.141
-You've never seen the ball drop?
-Only on TV.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.185
Bullshit.

09:20.269 --> 09:23.730
I swear. I've never seen it live, Chick.
Just once I wanna be there live.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.816
All right, come on. Let's go!

09:42.708 --> 09:43.709
Goddamn it.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.506
Poor Minogue. He was the best.

09:50.007 --> 09:53.385
Don't say "was." MIA doesn't mean dead.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.054
If anyone can survive out there,
it's Tommy.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.141
He and his brothers,
they got those street smarts, you know?

10:00.601 --> 10:01.935
Look at these scumbags.

10:02.019 --> 10:05.522
Hey, hey, LBJ!
How many kids did you kill today?

10:05.606 --> 10:07.107
Hey. What are you doing?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.866
Go home! Go home, you commie bastards.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.960
Hey, man! Stop, man! What are you doing?

10:27.044 --> 10:30.339
Those candles represent soldiers
who were killed in Vietnam!

10:32.925 --> 10:35.177
Sorry. I thought they were peace candles.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.595
What, you got a problem with peace?

10:37.346 --> 10:38.847
I got a problem with you, mouth!

10:38.931 --> 10:40.682
These demonstrations
are hurting our troops!

10:40.766 --> 10:43.143
Yeah, why don't you just keep marching
right up to Canada

10:43.227 --> 10:44.478
and lock the key behind you?

10:45.604 --> 10:47.481
Come on, Chickie. Let's get outta here.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.318
What the hell?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.737
How many kids did you kill today?

10:53.820 --> 10:57.032
Hey, hey, LBJ!
How many kids did you kill today?

10:59.201 --> 11:00.536
Hey! Let's go.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.620
…go of me!

11:02.496 --> 11:04.790
What the hell are you doing? Go home now!

11:04.873 --> 11:07.376
You're embarrassing yourself,
and you're embarrassing your family!

11:07.459 --> 11:10.629
Trying to save more Inwood kids from dying
is embarrassing myself?

11:10.712 --> 11:13.882
That's right.
Because this ain't helping nobody.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.801
At least I'm trying to get 'em home alive.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.970
Everyone's doing something,
and you're doing nothing.

11:18.053 --> 11:18.887
Doing nothing?

11:18.971 --> 11:21.723
I served four years in uniform,
starting when I was 18 years old.

11:21.807 --> 11:24.601
You were playing poker
in a military base in Massachusetts.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.895
You weren't dodging bullets,
you were dodging bar tabs.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.564
So quit acting like you've been there!

11:28.647 --> 11:30.691
Come on. You know what? Screw you!

11:30.774 --> 11:31.775
Now, let's go.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.735
I'm not going anywhere with you!

11:33.819 --> 11:36.738
I'm gonna be here every day
until this war's over,

11:36.822 --> 11:38.282
because this war is immoral!

11:38.365 --> 11:40.325
Don't tell us about immoral, all right?

11:40.409 --> 11:43.579
We're burying Johnny Knopf tomorrow,
and Tommy Minogue's MIA,

11:43.662 --> 11:45.455
and you're out here
marching with the enemy?

11:46.290 --> 11:49.126
-Tommy?
-Let's just go home, please?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.336
Don't tarnish Johnny's memory like this.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.505
"Tarnish his memory"?

11:54.006 --> 11:58.093
I'm doing this to honor his memory,
you dumb shit!

11:58.177 --> 12:00.721
I don't wanna see no more kids die
for nothing!

12:00.804 --> 12:04.600
For nothing?
They died to save us from communism!

12:04.683 --> 12:08.604
This war isn't about stopping communism,
it's about spreading imperialism!

12:08.687 --> 12:10.522
Hey, cool-breeze. Shut the fuck up!

12:10.606 --> 12:13.525
-You shut up!
-Yeah. Don't push us into your war.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.652
-Fascist pig!
-You're the problem, man!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.779
What the-- My war?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.699
I'm just here looking out for my friends,
who, by the way,

12:20.782 --> 12:22.784
-are over there fighting for you!
-Exactly!

12:22.868 --> 12:24.828
We don't need your friends killing for us,
man!

12:24.912 --> 12:27.080
You know what, baby killer?
You and me, let's go!

12:27.164 --> 12:29.541
I don't wanna fight, man.
This march is about peace.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.835
To hell with your peace!
Come on. You and me, let's go!

12:31.919 --> 12:33.378
-I'm not gonna fight you.
-Stop it.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.631
You don't have a choice!
I'm gonna hit you in about three seconds.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.924
But I'll give you the first crack.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.259
Go ahead, give it your best shot.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.137
What are you doing?

12:42.221 --> 12:44.014
Don't you do it, Chickie, don't!

12:44.097 --> 12:46.600
-You asshole!
-Stop! Stop it!

12:49.061 --> 12:51.813
Hey! Back off! Back off!

12:52.397 --> 12:54.066
Stay there! Hey! Back off!

12:54.149 --> 12:55.234
Hey, Christine!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.529
Christine!

13:00.781 --> 13:02.282
Take a shower!

13:02.950 --> 13:06.495
Those pussies had us outnumbered 10-to-2,
and we still kicked their asses!

13:07.496 --> 13:09.498
So how'd your cheek get all swelled up?

13:10.541 --> 13:13.794
Sucker-punch. Some hippie.
That's what started it.

13:13.877 --> 13:20.425
Do these dumbass protesters not know
that our soldiers see that bullshit on TV

13:21.009 --> 13:23.178
and that it's broadcast
all over the world?

13:23.262 --> 13:26.348
And this is exactly what the enemy wants.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.977
To see us divided. Fighting.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.812
If Americans can't agree,

13:31.895 --> 13:35.148
it makes it look like they're right,
and we're wrong.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.317
I just wish our guys could see

13:37.401 --> 13:39.695
that the vast minority
of the country's behind them.

13:39.778 --> 13:42.698
-You mean vast majority?
-Well, no. I wouldn't go that far.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.741
I think most people are behind them,
yeah, sure.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.909
But not everyone.

13:46.702 --> 13:49.746
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to go over to Vietnam

13:49.830 --> 13:55.085
and track down Reynolds, Collins,
Pappas, Duggan, Minogue.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.254
You know,
all the boys in the neighborhood.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.758
And just give them a beer, you know?
To say thank you.

14:02.551 --> 14:03.677
To the boys!

14:03.760 --> 14:05.470
-To the boys!
-The boys!

14:05.554 --> 14:06.972
I could do that.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.015
Do what?

14:08.599 --> 14:09.850
Bring 'em beer.

14:11.351 --> 14:15.439
I could sign up for a ship headed to 'Nam.
Drop off a few brews.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.025
Are there even boats going over there
with the wars going on?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.611
Hell yeah.
Who do you think's bringing 'em supplies?

14:20.694 --> 14:21.778
Are you serious, Chick?

14:21.862 --> 14:24.156
You can just hop on a merchant marine ship
and drive over there?

14:24.239 --> 14:26.867
Of course he's not serious.
He's hammered. Look at him.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.454
The man's stone sober.
That's his fifth beer, maybe, tops.

14:31.163 --> 14:34.041
Don't bullshit us, Chick.
Could you really pull this off?

14:34.625 --> 14:37.503
Could, would, and will. That's a promise.

14:38.045 --> 14:42.633
I'm gonna show 'em that this neighborhood
and this country is still behind 'em.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.553
What Chickie's saying is important.

14:46.637 --> 14:47.638
It's very important.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.640
It'll prop our boys up.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.059
Maybe a good ol' American beer
will remind them

14:52.142 --> 14:53.310
what they're fightin' for.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.312
Thank God someone knows.

14:56.647 --> 14:59.316
You bring it to 'em in this.
That way they know it's from all of us.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.859
We're bringing the boys beer.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.864
Hey, Chickie? Chickie, don't do this.
Tell 'em you're full of shit.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.950
-It's always harder afterwards.
-Okay.

15:08.033 --> 15:12.037
Get me a list of all the guys
and the units that they're in, okay?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.290
Because I'm going to Vietnam,
and I'm bringing them beer!

15:15.374 --> 15:18.168
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Let's go!

15:20.295 --> 15:21.797
God bless you, Chickie.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.883
Those brave bastards over there,
fighting and dying for this country.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.803
We're sitting on our asses doing nothing.
Except for you.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.222
Yeah. Well, I ain't done nothing yet.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.140
The hard part's gonna be finding a ship.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.893
Then, once I get over there,
how am I even gonna track 'em down?

15:34.977 --> 15:37.437
Shouldn't be that difficult.
Small country, right?

15:37.521 --> 15:40.357
Shitload of trees, though.
It's like an African jungle over there.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.861
Hey, McFadden just got back from 'Nam.
I bet he's got a map.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.779
He could show you
where they're all stationed.

15:45.863 --> 15:48.156
Right, but like I said,
getting there's the real problem.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.034
Even if I do find a ship,
what if they're fully staffed up? They--

15:51.118 --> 15:54.371
Chickie! When you're in Vietnam,
you're gonna visit my son, right?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.624
-Well--
-127th MP Company.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.710
See, it's right there on the patch
on his shoulder.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.587
He'll be so excited
to see a friendly face.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.922
Yeah, there's still a few kinks
to iron out, Mrs. Collins.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.508
Like, I don't even know
if it's possible for me to get over there.

16:06.592 --> 16:09.094
And when you see him,
please give him a hug for me.

16:11.763 --> 16:15.517
Jesus, those guys are putting the horse
way in front of the cart.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.685
What do you mean?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.897
I never said I was going to Vietnam,
I said I was gonna try to go.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.441
No, I'm pretty sure you said you was going
and that you was bringing beer.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.109
Yeah. If there was a boat.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.903
Yeah, I don't remember that part.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.905
Shit, Noodle. Read between the lines!

16:27.988 --> 16:30.115
How the hell can I control
if there's a boat or not?

16:30.199 --> 16:32.034
-Okay.
-No, it's not okay.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.286
'Cause now I'm gonna look like an asshole
if I don't go.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.663
-To who?
-To those guys.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.957
Don't worry about those guys.
They don't really think you're going.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.667
They're just busting your balls.

16:40.751 --> 16:43.504
What? They don't think I'm going?

16:44.546 --> 16:45.923
Well, you're not going, right?

16:46.507 --> 16:49.343
That's beside the point.
Why do they think I'm not going?

16:50.135 --> 16:52.179
Well, no offense, but, come on, Chick.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.722
There's a lot of things
you say you're gonna do

16:53.805 --> 16:56.642
that you don't get around to doing
'cause, you know, you get busy.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.436
What things I ever say
I was gonna do I didn't do, huh?

17:02.523 --> 17:04.148
Seriously. Name one thing.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.567
You never became a cop.

17:05.651 --> 17:08.237
And you never played shortstop
for the Yankees.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.113
-What?
-It was fifth grade.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.531
I said I was gonna be a cop.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.951
What, you're not allowed
to change your mind after fifth grade?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.035
That doesn't count.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.494
Well, you never graduated high school.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.954
When did I say I would?

17:18.539 --> 17:20.207
You never sold peanuts
at the Polo Grounds.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.875
Because the day I was gonna start,

17:21.959 --> 17:25.295
Patty Benedetto gave me a way better job
loading rigs at Empire Trucking.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.297
Yeah,
but then you quit that job one day after.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.758
So it's my fault the boss was an asshole?

17:29.842 --> 17:33.804
Well-- Look, Chickie, all we're saying is,
you don't have to go to Vietnam.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.639
It's not like people really expect you to.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.224
Let's go.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.274
So when were you gonna tell us?

17:46.316 --> 17:48.527
You know, that you're bringing beer
to your friends in Vietnam.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.655
Richie Reynolds's girlfriend, Jeanie,
dropped these socks off.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.074
She already mailed him a few pairs,
but he never got them.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.451
So she wants you to hand deliver 'em.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.787
And Mr. Collins dropped off 33 bucks
for Tommy,

17:58.871 --> 18:02.374
so he could pay back his poker losses
and he wants you to tell him to stop.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.586
So, I'm just curious,
how many pops in were you

18:05.669 --> 18:07.838
when you came up
with this brilliant notion?

18:08.714 --> 18:11.049
So Christine,
you saying I'd have to be drunk

18:11.133 --> 18:12.926
to wanna support my friends in Vietnam?

18:13.010 --> 18:15.137
How would bringing beer
be supporting them?

18:16.221 --> 18:19.308
It's about friendship and loyalty,
something you know nothing about.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.102
If you really want to support them,
help us get 'em the hell out of there.

18:22.186 --> 18:24.396
Oh, my God. You're like a broken record.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.648
You know, I can't--
The thing I can't figure out

18:26.732 --> 18:29.276
is how he's gonna get
all the Clydesdales on the boat.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.945
You three, don't laugh at him.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.364
You'll talk him into this foolishness
and get him killed.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.991
Stop it, Catherine.

18:36.074 --> 18:39.244
No one's ever gotten killed sleeping
till 3:00 in the afternoon.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.370
Chickie's fine.

18:51.048 --> 18:53.675
Mrs. Minogue. I--

18:53.759 --> 18:56.512
Chickie, I hear you're going over
to visit the boys.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.015
I want you to bring this to Tommy
when you see him.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.353
-Yeah, come on in. Just, come on in.
-No.

19:04.436 --> 19:05.729
I want to drop these off.

19:07.898 --> 19:12.110
They can't find Tommy right now…
but I'm sure they will.

19:12.778 --> 19:15.113
No, please, Mrs. Minogue,
you hold onto those, all right?

19:15.197 --> 19:16.198
If I end up going,

19:16.281 --> 19:18.700
then I'll come and pick 'em up from you,
okay? I promise.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.078
No. You see,
Tommy said that he brought some,

19:21.161 --> 19:22.621
but I bet he didn't.

19:23.956 --> 19:27.292
Anyway, having two sets can't hurt, right?

19:29.753 --> 19:30.963
No, I guess not.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.383
Thank you, Chickie.

19:53.902 --> 19:54.987
Hey, chief.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.448
No chance you have a ship heading
to Vietnam any time soon, right?

19:59.616 --> 20:02.077
That cargo ship, Drake,
getting ready to push off.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.330
No shit. What time?

20:05.831 --> 20:07.207
1700 hours.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.751
Tonight?

20:10.335 --> 20:12.129
-What, in three hours?
-Yeah.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.257
Goes out of Jersey, straight to Panama,
then straight to 'Nam.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.176
Should be there in two months or so.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.345
But I doubt they need an oiler
this late in the game?

20:20.429 --> 20:21.555
Oiler.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.350
Hey, you're in luck.
They're still one short.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.189
And why are they going out of Jersey?

20:30.272 --> 20:32.357
She's loaded with 10,000 tons of ammo.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.735
Blow up half of Manhattan
if something went sideways.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.862
If Jersey goes up, who'd miss it?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.198
You want in?

20:53.962 --> 20:54.963
Chickie!

20:56.423 --> 20:57.925
You can't be serious?

20:58.008 --> 20:59.259
What?

20:59.343 --> 21:01.929
Please don't do this.
This is the dumbest thing I ever heard.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.932
Dumber than carrying around signs,
calling our friends baby killers?

21:05.015 --> 21:07.184
Don't give me that shit.
I wasn't carrying that sign.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.561
Yeah, but you were marching
with someone who was.

21:11.021 --> 21:13.023
Just imagine being a soldier,

21:13.106 --> 21:15.108
just got home
and that's the first thing he sees,

21:15.192 --> 21:16.193
is that sign.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.530
Please, Chick.

21:20.322 --> 21:23.033
-You're gonna get yourself killed there.
-No, I'm not.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.078
Yes, you are! I don't get it.
Why are you doing this?

21:26.745 --> 21:29.831
It's like you said.
Everyone's doing something.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.251
I'm doing nothing.

22:13.709 --> 22:16.753
Three days' leave?
You got some nuts on you, Donohue.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.463
Nobody gets three days.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.799
What about the engine room?
That's gonna run itself?

22:20.883 --> 22:22.843
Sir,
I worked double-time the whole way here,

22:22.926 --> 22:24.344
and I got all my shifts covered, sir.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.180
I don't give two shits.

22:26.263 --> 22:28.807
And don't talk to me like we're
in the marines, you butt-licker.

22:28.891 --> 22:31.310
No one's getting off this ship.
We're in a goddamn war zone.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.519
But I have to.

22:32.603 --> 22:35.105
You have to? What's your deal, Donohue?

22:35.189 --> 22:38.358
I need to find my stepbrother.
Ricky Duggan, First Air Cav.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.611
Stepbrother?
He's not your goddamn real brother?

22:40.694 --> 22:43.405
No way. You ain't getting three days
for a half-ass brother.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.365
I got a rust bucket to run here.

22:45.449 --> 22:49.119
But he is my real brother, sir.
My mom is his mom.

22:49.203 --> 22:52.289
You know, my dad died fighting in Okinawa.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.833
And, you know, my mom remarried
and Ricky was born,

22:54.917 --> 22:57.503
and we was raised together,
just like real brothers.

22:57.586 --> 23:02.090
You know, I just got word
my stepdad, Ricky's dad, just died.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.843
I don't want Ricky to read the news
in a letter

23:05.344 --> 23:07.054
or hear about it on a phone call.

23:08.055 --> 23:10.599
I would like to tell him in person.

23:11.683 --> 23:12.726
How'd he die?

23:13.644 --> 23:14.895
Stroke.

23:14.978 --> 23:15.979
Linger?

23:16.063 --> 23:19.691
Yeah. Like a week or two.
It got real ugly at the end there, so…

23:19.775 --> 23:21.151
Where's this stepbrother?

23:21.235 --> 23:26.698
He's up north. The LZ… Jane.

23:26.782 --> 23:27.783
Christ.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.703
Shit's hit the fan up there.
You could be walking into a bloodbath.

23:31.787 --> 23:32.829
You know that, right?

23:33.747 --> 23:36.166
Well, he's my brother.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.378
You get all the info on the stepbrother
and all that,

23:39.461 --> 23:42.172
in case Donohue gets his balls blown off
stepping on a land mine?

23:42.256 --> 23:43.423
Yeah, all right here.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.426
Okay. You got three days.

23:48.262 --> 23:52.015
It's 8:05. If you're not back here
in 72 hours and one second,

23:52.099 --> 23:53.100
you better be dead.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.644
Yes, sir. You have my word, sir!

24:38.520 --> 24:42.357
Hey,
you guys ain't with the 127th MP Company?

24:42.858 --> 24:44.109
Yeah, and what about it?

24:44.193 --> 24:46.862
You don't happen to know a guy
named Tommy Collins from New York?

24:46.945 --> 24:48.530
Yeah, we know Collins.

24:48.614 --> 24:50.407
-No shit?
-Yeah.

24:52.326 --> 24:56.121
Yeah. You wouldn't know
where I could find him, would you?

24:57.039 --> 24:59.082
-Why?
-I just brought him a couple of beers

24:59.166 --> 25:00.375
from New York.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.961
Seriously, pal,
why you looking for Collins?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.047
No, I'm being serious. I--

25:05.130 --> 25:07.049
This whole thing's full of beer
from back home.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.177
Now, listen, smart-mouth.
You looking to take a swim?

25:10.260 --> 25:12.763
No. Guys-- Look, I ain't messin' with you.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.389
I'm serious. This-- Here.

25:17.434 --> 25:20.812
In fact, you know what?
I got a couple for you too.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.322
Hey, Pete. He's good. Let him in.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.533
Hey, buddy. He is in there somewhere.

25:32.616 --> 25:33.659
-Thanks, guys.
-All right.

25:42.668 --> 25:47.130
All right, which one of you donut holes
wants to get your ass kicked first?

25:50.926 --> 25:53.011
-The fuck you say?
-You heard me, cupcake.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.930
What,
you think that uniform makes you tough?

25:59.142 --> 26:02.020
Come on, bring it on.
I'll stuff you right in that helmet.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.279
Chickie, Chickie, Chickie!
What the hell are you doing in here?

26:10.362 --> 26:11.989
You know, I was just in the neighborhood.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.323
No, seriously. What are you--

26:13.407 --> 26:15.367
Guys, this is my buddy from back home,
Chickie Donohue.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.493
Yeah.

26:16.577 --> 26:18.245
Got some pretty screwy friends, Collins.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.330
Without a doubt. Guess what?

26:21.456 --> 26:24.543
This screwy friend
just came 10,000 nautical miles

26:24.626 --> 26:27.254
to deliver your ass
a sudsy thank-you card.

26:30.299 --> 26:32.467
Like my grandfather used to say,

26:32.551 --> 26:34.678
always ring the doorbell with your elbow.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.889
And that, my friends,
is called the Irish hello.

26:36.972 --> 26:38.515
-Here. Take that.
-Hello, Ireland.

26:38.599 --> 26:39.600
Hello.

26:40.642 --> 26:41.810
Take it.

26:42.728 --> 26:45.981
I still can't believe you came
all this way just to bring me a beer.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.065
Not just you.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.944
I came for Duggan, Reynolds, Pappas.
All the guys.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.947
-That's the dumbest thing I ever heard of.
-Really?

26:54.031 --> 26:56.533
Is it dumber than the time you took a pull
off your nephew's baby bottle,

26:56.617 --> 26:58.827
'cause you wanted to know
what titty milk tastes like?

26:58.911 --> 27:00.829
That was your sister's titty milk?

27:00.913 --> 27:03.123
No, it was my brother's wife's.
I'm not an asshole.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.666
Hey, hey. Wait, wait.

27:04.750 --> 27:08.212
So, I got this from your old man,
$33 to pay off your poker debt.

27:08.295 --> 27:09.713
-Thank you.
-Almeida, what the hell--

27:09.796 --> 27:11.048
Uh-uh. Now we're even, buddy.

27:12.049 --> 27:13.383
What the hell's going on here?

27:13.467 --> 27:14.551
Attention!

27:16.595 --> 27:18.555
Where'd those beers come from?

27:19.431 --> 27:20.557
Who the hell are you?

27:22.059 --> 27:23.143
I'm Chickie Donohue.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.521
And what the hell are you doing here?

27:25.604 --> 27:26.772
Just got off a ship, sir.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.524
Am I talking to you, Collins?

27:32.069 --> 27:33.320
What's your business?

27:35.447 --> 27:36.573
Just traveling around.

27:37.533 --> 27:38.700
Be more specific.

27:39.368 --> 27:43.705
Okay. More specific--
I'm traveling around Viet-- In Vietnam,

27:43.789 --> 27:45.457
and I'm bringing beers

27:45.541 --> 27:48.752
to as many of my friends
from my neighborhood as I can.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.713
You're traveling in country? Alone?

27:53.590 --> 27:54.967
Yeah. That's right.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.559
Understood.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.436
As you were.

28:09.898 --> 28:11.191
As you were.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.405
-He seems like an okay guy.
-He's not.

28:16.488 --> 28:18.031
Did he just have a stroke?

28:18.115 --> 28:19.616
Nah. Don't you get it?

28:19.700 --> 28:21.827
He thinks
your man Don Ho here is a "tourist."

28:23.245 --> 28:24.872
What do you mean? I am a tourist.

28:24.955 --> 28:28.083
-Tourist is what we call CIA.
-CIA? Get the hell outta here.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.169
Man, who else but CIA
would be headed up-country,

28:30.252 --> 28:31.670
dressed like they're going on a golf trip?

28:32.254 --> 28:33.463
No, Erickson's right.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.550
The military brass does not like
to mix it up with CIA.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.552
Yeah, that's the quickest way
to get your ass reassigned

28:38.635 --> 28:39.636
to combat patrol.

28:40.971 --> 28:45.350
You're kidding me. He thinks I'm CIA?
Like James Bond?

28:47.728 --> 28:50.439
Well, in that case…

28:58.113 --> 28:59.740
Yeah, come on!

29:14.338 --> 29:16.298
-Reynolds is over there.
-Yeah.

29:16.381 --> 29:20.385
Duggan's up here somewhere and Pappas is--

29:20.469 --> 29:22.513
He's right around the ammo dump,
right here.

29:23.013 --> 29:26.683
So… I mean,
what's my plan of attack, I guess?

29:26.767 --> 29:28.018
How much time you got?

29:30.145 --> 29:31.647
Forty-seven hours.

29:32.314 --> 29:33.524
It's gonna be tight.

29:34.483 --> 29:39.863
What if he starts up here with Duggan
and then hustles down to…

29:39.947 --> 29:41.698
-Reynolds. Yeah.
-…Reynolds.

29:41.782 --> 29:44.743
And then back down to Pappas?

29:45.661 --> 29:48.580
Why? I don't understand.
How come I just can't go see Pappas first?

29:48.664 --> 29:50.249
'Cause I can practically see his base
from here.

29:50.332 --> 29:51.625
Nah, Baby-Face is right.

29:51.708 --> 29:54.002
Pappas might be the closest,
but he is furthest in time.

29:54.086 --> 29:56.296
Long Binh's the biggest ammo dump
in this country.

29:56.380 --> 29:57.631
They'll be doing background checks.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.300
Ask about your high school girlfriend,
count your hemorrhoids--

30:00.384 --> 30:02.678
Christ, it would take Westmoreland
half a day to get in there.

30:03.262 --> 30:05.264
-Go see Duggan and then the other guy…
-Reynolds.

30:05.347 --> 30:08.392
…and if you're still alive
and you have time,

30:08.475 --> 30:10.519
then you can hit Pappas on the way back.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.104
That's right. How you getting there?

30:13.063 --> 30:14.898
I don't know. I figured I'd hitchhike.

30:16.066 --> 30:18.735
What? You don't have a plan?

30:18.819 --> 30:20.028
Are you kidding me?

30:20.696 --> 30:21.864
How would I have a plan?

30:21.947 --> 30:24.658
It's not like you can hire a tour bus
out here. Can you?

30:25.367 --> 30:26.910
-Jesus Christ.
-I don't know.

30:28.620 --> 30:31.248
What if he caught a plane to LZ Jane?

30:31.331 --> 30:32.332
Go airplane?

30:32.416 --> 30:34.001
How's he gonna do that? He ain't military.

30:34.626 --> 30:37.880
Wait, wait. Why can't I just hitchhike?
Isn't there still roads?

30:37.963 --> 30:39.923
I don't know if it's hit the papers
back home yet,

30:40.007 --> 30:41.800
but folks are getting their asses shot
in these parts.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.218
Are you guys nuts?

30:46.013 --> 30:47.431
Give me that thing.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.601
Stop helping him.
What are you trying to do, get him killed?

30:57.900 --> 30:59.776
Chickie,
you gotta get the hell out of here.

31:00.319 --> 31:03.614
Yeah, okay. I'll get my shit.
I don't want to get you guys in trouble.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.990
No, I mean out of 'Nam.

31:06.033 --> 31:08.911
Yeah, I will. In a few days,
as soon as I see the other guys.

31:08.994 --> 31:10.871
You can't be serious about this, Chick.

31:11.496 --> 31:13.498
Come on, man, you did it.
You got me hammered in Vietnam,

31:13.582 --> 31:16.376
and I'm sure we're gonna have a lot
of laughs about this forever.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.170
Let's quit while we're ahead, huh?

31:19.630 --> 31:21.924
I didn't come all this way just to quit
after one night.

31:22.591 --> 31:25.219
What am I supposed to do? Let you
go out there like a babe in Toyland

31:25.302 --> 31:27.387
and get your brains blown out
like Knopf did?

31:28.222 --> 31:29.973
You're worrying way too much.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.935
I'm not gonna be fighting no one,
I'm just deliverin' beers.

31:33.435 --> 31:36.104
You don't get it, do you, Chick?
This isn't a John Wayne movie, all right?

31:36.188 --> 31:38.273
Where you know who the good guys are
and the bad guys are.

31:38.357 --> 31:39.358
This is guerrilla warfare,

31:39.441 --> 31:41.485
and they can come at you from anywhere,
at any time.

31:41.568 --> 31:44.071
Bringing beers into a fucking war zone?
That's a batshit crazy idea.

31:44.154 --> 31:46.490
I mean, you didn't really think
you can pull this off, did you?

31:46.573 --> 31:48.951
But why the hell you think
I came all the way to 'Nam?

31:49.034 --> 31:51.578
I don't know, Chick! You lost a bet,
you're runnin' from the cops,

31:51.662 --> 31:54.081
you knocked someone up--
I can't figure it out!

31:55.040 --> 31:57.793
Chickie, even if you wanted to do this,
there's no way for you to get around.

31:57.876 --> 31:59.837
The only non-military people
who can travel the country

31:59.920 --> 32:00.921
are the press.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.714
Well, where are they?
I'll go talk to them.

32:02.798 --> 32:04.007
They're at the Hotel Caravelle,

32:04.091 --> 32:05.843
but they're not gonna help you.
You're a civilian.

32:06.468 --> 32:09.221
I'm an American civilian.
I'm one of them, you know?

32:09.304 --> 32:12.015
No, you're not. You're nothing like them.

32:13.559 --> 32:16.144
I think you're forgetting
who you're talking to, yeah?

32:16.228 --> 32:17.354
It's me, Chickie.

32:18.105 --> 32:21.316
Look, you just guard the ships, okay?
I'll handle the press.

32:47.342 --> 32:50.179
No, thank you. It's okay.

32:53.015 --> 32:55.058
Thank you. Thanks.

32:56.351 --> 32:57.352
You American?

32:58.395 --> 32:59.688
Yeah. Yeah.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.065
You from Oklahoma?

33:02.149 --> 33:04.234
No. New York.

33:05.402 --> 33:06.695
Near Oklahoma?

33:07.738 --> 33:10.991
No, not really. Not even close, actually.

33:11.742 --> 33:14.286
Like Oklahoma! Good movie.

33:14.870 --> 33:16.538
Yeah. Good football too.

33:17.164 --> 33:19.208
MacRae, great actor.

33:20.459 --> 33:25.547
Gordon MacRae. Yeah.
Yeah, he is. He's very good. Very good.

33:26.423 --> 33:30.886
Hey, do you know
where the Caravelle Hotel is around here?

33:32.471 --> 33:34.806
Two down, on left.

33:35.849 --> 33:37.518
-Safe to walk.
-Okay.

33:40.312 --> 33:41.313
Hey, Oklahoma?

33:43.065 --> 33:44.399
Thanks a lot!

34:20.018 --> 34:23.397
Hello.
My name is Hien. How may I help you?

34:23.480 --> 34:24.898
A whiskey soda, please.

34:24.982 --> 34:27.067
Whiskey soda on the way.

34:45.668 --> 34:49.255
Boy, this is one hell of a place
to watch a war from, right?

34:49.339 --> 34:53.594
War, it's far. But managed here in Saigon.

34:55.804 --> 34:59.183
Hey, do you know where I can find any
of the reporter guys around here?

34:59.975 --> 35:03.312
Press? Throw dart, hit press guy.

35:03.395 --> 35:05.981
Right. Hey, thank you.

35:23.498 --> 35:24.875
Hey, how's it going?

35:28.754 --> 35:30.214
I'm American.

35:30.297 --> 35:35.469
And I find an attitude of confidence
and growing optimism.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.304
It prevails all over the country.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.681
This is bullshit. Are you hearing this?

35:40.432 --> 35:44.561
Westmoreland's saying there's a feeling
of optimism all over Vietnam

35:44.645 --> 35:47.814
and that the Communists are running
for the hills.

35:48.398 --> 35:50.943
Finish up your drinks, chaps.
Time to go home.

35:52.027 --> 35:54.988
A number of South Vietnamese living
in areas

35:55.072 --> 35:59.660
under government protection tonight
has grown by more than a million

35:59.743 --> 36:01.703
since January of last year.

36:01.787 --> 36:03.747
Turn that lying asshole off.

36:05.082 --> 36:07.417
Hey, I don't appreciate that.

36:07.501 --> 36:09.878
That's the President of the United States
you're talking about.

36:09.962 --> 36:11.463
He deserves some respect.

36:14.174 --> 36:15.384
Why?

36:15.467 --> 36:16.844
All right, look. Look, I don't care

36:16.927 --> 36:19.471
what you think of him personally
as a person,

36:20.764 --> 36:24.268
but you gotta respect the Office
of the President of the United States.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.186
I mean, look who he is.

36:26.270 --> 36:30.691
You expect us to respect the man
who's telling the American people

36:30.774 --> 36:32.150
we're actually winning the war?

36:32.818 --> 36:37.155
And that we, the media,
are keeping it a secret?

36:38.240 --> 36:39.575
If the shoe fits.

36:40.325 --> 36:41.410
Hien.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.580
One more time for Jesus.

36:46.081 --> 36:47.416
So, tell me.

36:48.667 --> 36:51.879
How did you become such an expert
on the public relations of war?

36:52.796 --> 36:55.382
I'm not an expert,
and I never said I was one.

36:55.924 --> 36:57.593
Thanks for the disclaimer.

36:58.343 --> 37:03.724
Hey, mister, people back home
get their news from you guys.

37:03.807 --> 37:06.977
And look, let's face it,
it ain't all been that positive lately.

37:07.477 --> 37:09.021
Why should it be positive?

37:09.104 --> 37:10.439
You don't understand why it's important

37:10.522 --> 37:13.192
that people back home get positive news
about the war?

37:13.275 --> 37:14.651
No. I don't.

37:14.735 --> 37:18.488
So they don't lose hope.
It's going crazy out there, and you--

37:18.572 --> 37:21.033
You're takin' the wind
out of everyone's sails.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.243
You're riling up protesters, it's--

37:24.369 --> 37:26.079
Look, I'm just saying,

37:27.080 --> 37:29.917
you might wanna support our boys
every once in a while.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.631
Telling the truth about this war
is being supportive of our boys.

37:36.131 --> 37:38.592
Well, it sure don't come across that way
on my TV.

37:39.801 --> 37:41.094
How are you supporting them?

37:43.680 --> 37:45.599
I support 'em in…

37:47.059 --> 37:49.937
in, like, many ways,
in lots of different ways.

37:50.020 --> 37:51.438
Yeah, that's what I figured.

37:54.233 --> 37:55.943
Okay, for one thing,

37:56.026 --> 38:00.072
I just traveled 12,000 nautical miles
to bring all my enlisted friends a gift.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.406
What kind of gift?

38:03.116 --> 38:05.118
Beer. Beat that.

38:05.202 --> 38:06.286
Beer?

38:08.664 --> 38:10.999
They can get beer here, you know?

38:13.001 --> 38:15.295
Yeah, but not American beer.

38:21.009 --> 38:25.597
Yeah, but this beer came
all the way from New York. So…

38:26.265 --> 38:28.308
Listen, the beer's not the point.

38:28.392 --> 38:31.019
The point is that I'm trying to show them

38:31.103 --> 38:33.480
that somebody back home
still gives a shit.

38:34.898 --> 38:36.650
Well, I give him credit.

38:36.733 --> 38:39.486
It may be idiotic,
but it's a noble gesture.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.281
Well then,
do you think you guys can help me out?

38:43.365 --> 38:48.537
Listen, I need to hop a plane to LZ Jane.

38:50.831 --> 38:55.085
You know what? I think I can swing it.

38:55.711 --> 38:59.256
I could maybe book you a flight
out of Bien Hoa.

39:00.549 --> 39:04.720
What's your preference?
You want like a window seat? Aisle?

39:05.220 --> 39:06.263
I don't care.

39:06.346 --> 39:09.099
Hey, you wanna go first-class?
Meal service?

39:11.935 --> 39:13.228
Anything you want, kid.

39:17.065 --> 39:18.066
Sorry, buddy.

39:18.150 --> 39:21.528
Why don't you just pack up your beer,
take it back to your frat?

39:23.071 --> 39:25.532
Besides, they won't even let us up there.

39:30.537 --> 39:34.166
Don't let them get to you.
You'll never win.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.794
But they're right about one thing.

39:37.878 --> 39:40.380
Impossible to get around
in my country right now.

39:40.881 --> 39:42.299
Military travel only.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.176
Military, huh?

40:07.658 --> 40:10.244
-Where you headed?
-I'm trying to get to… Bien…

40:11.995 --> 40:14.331
Bien… The air base.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.500
-Come in. I can take you.
-Yeah?

40:18.794 --> 40:19.795
Thanks.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.261
Hey, thank you!

40:31.056 --> 40:32.766
Just go inside and up the stairs.

40:39.523 --> 40:42.609
Hey.
Do you have a plane heading to LZ Jane?

40:46.154 --> 40:49.199
I can get you most of the way there.
Then you're gonna have to chopper in.

40:49.283 --> 40:52.870
Okay. Go ahead and put my name
on the manifest. It's John Donohue.

40:52.953 --> 40:56.707
-Donohue, you said? Right.
-Donohue. Yeah. John Donohue.

40:56.790 --> 40:58.667
And what's your rank, sir?

40:59.751 --> 41:00.961
I'm not military.

41:02.171 --> 41:04.631
Well, that's gonna have to be cleared
with the captain, sir.

41:04.715 --> 41:06.758
Okay. You can go get him.

41:11.346 --> 41:12.431
Get him!

41:17.644 --> 41:18.645
Yeah?

41:29.198 --> 41:30.741
You the guy trying to get to LZ Jane?

41:30.824 --> 41:32.075
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.285
You're a civilian?

41:33.869 --> 41:35.746
Yes. As far as you're concerned.

41:38.248 --> 41:39.583
It's one of you guys.

41:39.666 --> 41:41.585
Why didn't you say so, Private?

41:41.668 --> 41:44.046
Put the gentleman's name
in the manifest immediately!

41:44.129 --> 41:45.380
Yes, sir.

41:58.393 --> 42:01.188
As soon as they're done unloading
the bodies, you can get on.

42:01.271 --> 42:02.272
Right.

42:37.683 --> 42:38.934
John Donohue?

42:39.017 --> 42:40.018
No.

42:43.188 --> 42:45.107
Sorry. I must have gotten the name wrong.

42:45.190 --> 42:49.444
Captain Dyer in Saigon instructed me
to be of assistance in any way I can.

42:51.238 --> 42:55.075
Oh, yeah. Dono… Donohue, yeah.
But they call me "Chickie."

42:55.158 --> 42:57.244
So, he told you to help me?

42:57.327 --> 42:59.121
Yes, sir. He's my superior officer.

42:59.204 --> 43:00.455
They shuffle me between here

43:00.539 --> 43:03.000
and Tan Son Nhut air base,
right outside Saigon.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.377
Habershaw, Lieutenant Habershaw. Yeah.

43:05.460 --> 43:08.589
-Let me get that for you, Mr. Donohue.
-Thank you.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.967
So, what can I do you for?

43:12.050 --> 43:14.344
Well, I need a lift to LZ Jane.

43:14.428 --> 43:17.347
Not a problem. I can have a bird
ready for you in 60 minutes.

43:17.431 --> 43:18.432
Really?

43:19.183 --> 43:20.475
Yeah, perfect.

43:20.559 --> 43:21.768
Have you eaten, sir?

43:22.352 --> 43:24.897
No, I have not.
How's the food around here?

43:25.814 --> 43:27.024
It'll make a turd, sir.

43:27.566 --> 43:28.901
That sounds great.

43:28.984 --> 43:31.403
I'd be honored to have you join me
in the Officer's Club for lunch.

43:31.486 --> 43:33.739
A friend of mine would love to meet you.

43:35.282 --> 43:36.950
You know what?
Thanks, Habershaw, I'm just--

43:37.034 --> 43:39.411
After that flight, I just
don't have that much of an appetite.

43:39.494 --> 43:40.871
-You sure?
-Yeah.

43:40.954 --> 43:42.956
We carry the best scotch
this side of Tokyo.

43:43.749 --> 43:44.750
The…

43:46.919 --> 43:49.922
So, what department are you guys in?

43:50.005 --> 43:53.091
Army transport service,
in conjunction with mortuary services.

43:53.675 --> 43:54.801
We move bodies.

43:55.511 --> 43:59.515
Our soldiers. KIA. In caskets.

43:59.598 --> 44:00.933
That must be hard,

44:02.184 --> 44:03.769
dealing with the dead all day.

44:03.852 --> 44:05.395
I don't think about it much, sir.

44:05.896 --> 44:08.065
I'll have plenty of time
to think about it all later.

44:09.274 --> 44:15.656
So, any chance you can brief us a little
about what you guys are planning?

44:16.698 --> 44:19.117
-You can trust us.
-Come on, Habershaw.

44:19.993 --> 44:23.205
If he could trust us, he wouldn't be
a very good CIA agent. Now, would he?

44:25.374 --> 44:26.375
That's true.

44:28.877 --> 44:30.629
Not that I am a CIA agent.

44:33.799 --> 44:36.468
By the way, I wasn't
the one who told Fusco who you are.

44:36.552 --> 44:38.053
That came from Captain Dyer in Saigon.

44:38.136 --> 44:40.180
I would never blow your cover.

44:40.264 --> 44:44.017
I see a lot of shit,
and it all stays right in here.

44:44.643 --> 44:45.727
Everything.

44:46.812 --> 44:48.397
I got a lot of shit in here.

44:50.399 --> 44:55.028
So, come on.
Can't you give us just a hint?

44:55.112 --> 44:58.740
You know, tell us without telling us?

45:02.077 --> 45:03.412
All right. Let's just say…

45:06.540 --> 45:10.085
I'm here to deliver beer to a friend.

45:11.795 --> 45:14.590
Beer? To who?

45:15.174 --> 45:17.593
A friend in Bravo Company. First Air Cav.

45:19.761 --> 45:20.762
Keg?

45:22.014 --> 45:23.348
Cans.

45:25.851 --> 45:27.769
Wow,
that's gonna be a shit show, isn't it?

45:29.188 --> 45:31.565
It's been a pleasure meeting you, sir.

45:31.648 --> 45:35.027
If you and your people
ever need any help. Any help.

45:35.110 --> 45:39.865
I mean, like, if you ever need
to get something out of here or back in,

45:39.948 --> 45:42.326
and you need it to be under the radar,
I'm your guy.

45:42.409 --> 45:43.410
Good to know.

45:43.493 --> 45:45.412
-Can I ask you a question, sir?
-Shoot.

45:45.495 --> 45:46.997
If someone wanted to do what you do,

45:47.080 --> 45:49.541
how does one go about
getting noticed by Langley?

45:49.625 --> 45:51.084
-Langley?
-Headquarters.

45:51.668 --> 45:53.670
How do the big boys at the CIA find you?

45:54.171 --> 45:57.424
Just be a good soldier and a good person.

45:57.925 --> 46:00.093
I am, sir. If it's not asking too much,

46:00.177 --> 46:02.471
do you think you could maybe
put in a positive word for me?

46:02.554 --> 46:03.847
Which helicopter am I getting in?

46:03.931 --> 46:05.057
-Straight ahead.
-Okay.

46:05.140 --> 46:07.726
So, you think you could?
Put in a good word?

46:07.809 --> 46:09.269
Okay, sure.

46:09.353 --> 46:12.314
Thank you, sir. I very much appreciate it.

46:12.397 --> 46:13.982
Do you need my name and company?

46:14.066 --> 46:15.817
No, we'll find you.

46:15.901 --> 46:19.613
Lt. Gill Habershaw. 528 Support Battalion.

46:20.197 --> 46:21.615
That'll make it easier.

47:04.658 --> 47:06.952
-Who the hell is this guy?
-I don't know.

47:07.035 --> 47:09.037
-I'm looking for Rick Duggan.
-Who?

47:09.121 --> 47:10.539
Rick Duggan.

47:10.622 --> 47:13.166
-You got orders?
-No.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.543
Let me see your papers.

47:15.043 --> 47:16.128
I don't have any.

47:16.211 --> 47:19.089
No orders, no papers. Mission classified?

47:21.675 --> 47:23.677
Goddamn it! They never tell me shit.

47:31.143 --> 47:32.936
Call Duggan in from the ambush post.

47:34.938 --> 47:36.315
Tell him he's got a visitor.

47:36.815 --> 47:37.900
What's your name, sir?

47:38.692 --> 47:41.111
Just call him in.
I kind of wanna surprise him.

47:44.573 --> 47:47.326
Romeo-45, this is Romeo-06, over.

47:47.409 --> 47:48.785
This is Romeo-45.

47:49.369 --> 47:51.705
Duggan, report to TOC ASAP, over.

47:51.788 --> 47:52.789
Right now?

47:52.873 --> 47:55.792
That's 200 meters,
and our situation's hot. Over.

47:57.836 --> 47:59.087
Right now.

47:59.171 --> 48:01.131
While it's still light out? Over.

48:02.341 --> 48:04.760
That's affirmative. Out.

48:05.260 --> 48:06.345
He's on his way.

48:06.929 --> 48:12.601
Okay. That's good.

48:13.185 --> 48:14.269
This is good.

48:14.353 --> 48:18.357
Okay. I'm gonna hide here.
And you guys cover me with this.

48:18.440 --> 48:19.650
No.

48:20.317 --> 48:21.318
Okay.

48:52.891 --> 48:54.893
-You wanted to see me, Sarge?
-No.

49:01.191 --> 49:02.484
Chickie?

49:03.861 --> 49:06.154
-What are you doing here?
-I brung you beer.

49:08.907 --> 49:10.868
-Who are you with?
-I'm with you.

49:11.451 --> 49:14.788
Seriously, Chickie,
what the hell are you doing here? Really.

49:14.872 --> 49:16.999
Me and all the fellas were sitting around

49:17.082 --> 49:19.084
talking about what we could do
to bring your spirits up.

49:19.168 --> 49:22.921
And then, bang! It hit us. Bring you
a beer. So, I brought you a beer.

49:24.756 --> 49:27.217
-You dumb shit!
-What?

49:27.801 --> 49:29.511
You almost got me killed out there!

49:29.595 --> 49:32.806
Wait a minute, Duggan. You mean
to tell me this asshole's a civilian?

49:32.890 --> 49:34.349
Yeah. Yes, Sarge.

49:34.433 --> 49:35.392
Is he nuts?

49:35.475 --> 49:37.060
I don't know. Chickie, are you nuts?

49:37.144 --> 49:38.604
What? No.

49:38.687 --> 49:42.191
-You're delivering beer in a battle zone?
-Yeah, so? It's fine.

49:42.274 --> 49:44.943
I just came from seeing Collins.
He didn't mind.

49:45.903 --> 49:47.613
You found Collins?

49:47.696 --> 49:48.697
Yeah.

49:50.157 --> 49:53.452
It was easy.
He was right next to my ship in Saigon.

49:53.952 --> 49:55.662
After this, I'm going to visit Reynolds
and Pappas.

49:55.746 --> 49:59.166
By the way, a lady tried to sell me
a snake on the way over here.

49:59.249 --> 50:02.377
-You think this is funny? Huh?
-What?

50:02.461 --> 50:05.756
-It's not funny at all!
-I don't think it's funny, okay!

50:05.839 --> 50:07.716
I'm not doing this for laughs, Ricky!

50:08.258 --> 50:11.220
I'm doing it for you, for all you guys.

50:11.303 --> 50:14.139
This is a goddamn war, Donohue.
You shouldn't be here.

50:14.223 --> 50:16.642
Chickie, get back to your boat right now.

50:16.725 --> 50:19.394
Forget about the other guys.
You can buy 'em a beer when they get home.

50:19.478 --> 50:20.938
This is serious shit out here.

50:21.021 --> 50:23.649
Yeah, I know.

50:23.732 --> 50:27.402
No. No, obviously you don't,
or you wouldn't be here!

50:28.654 --> 50:32.157
You keep on this stupid beer run,
there's a 99% chance you're going tits up.

50:32.241 --> 50:36.078
Sarge, can we get a egg beater in tonight
and, you know, scoot him out of here?

50:36.161 --> 50:38.413
It's too dangerous.
Nothing's flying till morning.

50:39.039 --> 50:40.499
So what am I supposed to do with him?

50:40.582 --> 50:42.626
Hell if I know. He's yours now.
Take him with you.

50:42.709 --> 50:44.336
What-- I'm on ambush post, sir.

50:44.419 --> 50:45.671
Your problem, Duggan!

50:50.133 --> 50:51.677
You want a taste of Vietnam?

50:53.095 --> 50:55.222
You're about to get it. Grab your shit.

50:57.474 --> 50:59.268
-Grab your shit!
-I am.

51:02.521 --> 51:03.522
Hey.

51:06.650 --> 51:07.651
Thanks.

51:10.487 --> 51:12.614
-What's this for?
-To shoot the bad guys, dodo.

51:12.698 --> 51:14.658
If it looks like
you're gonna be taken for prisoner,

51:14.741 --> 51:16.493
shoot yourself
or they'll torture you for info.

51:16.577 --> 51:18.579
For info? Hold on. I don't have any info.

51:18.662 --> 51:20.289
They don't know that, asshole!

51:20.873 --> 51:23.417
Okay, geez. A bit edgy.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.710
No. Bad idea, Sarge.

51:24.793 --> 51:27.254
He's got a better chance
of shooting one of us than one of them.

51:27.337 --> 51:31.008
What are you talking about?
I know guns. I was in the military.

51:31.091 --> 51:33.051
-Where'd you serve?
-Massachusetts.

51:33.677 --> 51:34.678
Yeah, give me that.

51:36.513 --> 51:37.639
Are you ready?

51:38.432 --> 51:40.434
I guess. What are we doing?

51:41.768 --> 51:43.270
We're gonna run for our lives.

52:00.871 --> 52:01.914
All right.

52:03.957 --> 52:06.335
-We're halfway home.
-Halfway?

52:06.418 --> 52:08.712
On the count of three, follow me. One--

52:09.296 --> 52:10.297
Wait.

52:10.380 --> 52:12.090
-What?
-Let's go back.

52:12.174 --> 52:14.551
Just as bad going back
as it is going forward.

52:14.635 --> 52:16.053
Then let's just stay here.

52:16.136 --> 52:17.930
Here? We're in no-man's-land.

52:18.013 --> 52:19.640
So? I'm okay with that.

52:19.723 --> 52:20.807
We gotta keep going.

52:21.391 --> 52:23.268
Can't we just call a tank or something?

52:23.352 --> 52:25.604
Tank-- There's no goddamn tanks out here.

52:26.939 --> 52:29.274
All right. On the count of three.

52:29.358 --> 52:32.861
One, two, three.

52:47.376 --> 52:48.377
Oh, shit!

52:52.005 --> 52:54.132
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

52:55.676 --> 52:56.927
All I could think about…

52:58.345 --> 53:00.305
"What if these are
the last moment of your life?"

53:00.806 --> 53:02.266
And all I could think was,

53:02.349 --> 53:06.311
"I hope they're aiming at the asshole
in the checkered shirt."

53:07.980 --> 53:09.189
Relax, relax.

53:09.273 --> 53:10.774
One of your beers just exploded.

53:12.150 --> 53:15.737
Just a beer. Just a beer.

53:31.461 --> 53:34.756
Duggan, where's the Starlight scope?
We got a lot of movement on the perimeter.

53:40.721 --> 53:42.306
What's going on? Are we okay?

53:42.389 --> 53:44.266
NVA are out there moving around.

53:45.100 --> 53:47.311
-NVA?
-Probably just passing by.

53:47.394 --> 53:49.688
But if they attack,
boogie on back to the line post.

53:50.647 --> 53:53.317
Okay. The line post is…

53:53.400 --> 53:56.236
-Back where we came from.
-Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

53:57.196 --> 53:59.323
Tell them to turn on the lights.
Let's see what's out there.

54:02.409 --> 54:04.494
India-26, this is Romeo-45.

54:04.578 --> 54:06.872
We need illumination
forward of our position. Over.

54:07.456 --> 54:09.875
Copy that, Romeo-45. Illumination inbound.

54:46.203 --> 54:47.204
Who's this hand job?

54:47.996 --> 54:48.997
Hi.

54:49.081 --> 54:52.543
He's my next-door neighbor.
He brought me a beer.

54:53.293 --> 54:54.294
What the hell does that mean?

54:54.378 --> 54:56.630
It means he jumped on a freight
in New York.

54:57.214 --> 54:59.967
Came all the way out here.
Bring me a beer.

55:01.385 --> 55:03.428
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

55:03.929 --> 55:07.599
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
you don't have to be here,

55:08.559 --> 55:09.685
and you're here?

55:11.395 --> 55:12.396
Yeah.

55:32.249 --> 55:33.250
Yo.

55:45.762 --> 55:47.055
How many beers you bring?

55:48.682 --> 55:49.683
A bunch.

55:51.768 --> 55:53.562
Now would be the time to pass them out.

55:54.646 --> 55:55.647
Yeah?

56:11.622 --> 56:12.623
Busker.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.875
Sorry, they're a little warm.

56:19.796 --> 56:22.090
That is good.

56:27.179 --> 56:28.597
Reynolds is dead.

56:29.973 --> 56:30.974
What?

56:33.435 --> 56:34.853
Got word a few days ago.

56:35.521 --> 56:36.563
No.

56:40.150 --> 56:41.568
Goddamn it.

56:47.407 --> 56:49.868
We never saw that kid
without a smile on his face.

56:54.998 --> 56:56.041
Yep.

57:01.922 --> 57:03.131
Any word on Minogue?

57:07.845 --> 57:08.846
No.

57:14.476 --> 57:15.811
Now, let's get some sleep.

57:17.688 --> 57:18.856
Where?

57:19.815 --> 57:22.651
Here. What, are you expecting
a Howard Johnson's?

57:37.833 --> 57:39.501
Throw this on if it gets rainy.

58:02.691 --> 58:04.526
You really Duggan's next-door neighbor?

58:08.864 --> 58:09.865
Yeah.

58:12.951 --> 58:14.536
Couple of apartments over,

58:15.746 --> 58:18.165
but close enough to hear
his old man yelling at him.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.168
He was a yeller.

58:22.169 --> 58:23.170
Where you from?

58:23.712 --> 58:24.713
Philly.

58:25.923 --> 58:27.424
How long till you go home?

58:28.592 --> 58:30.302
I don't really keep track anymore.

58:32.137 --> 58:33.639
You don't wanna jinx it?

58:36.266 --> 58:38.602
I went home after my first tour.

58:42.397 --> 58:43.815
I didn't fit in.

58:45.067 --> 58:46.443
So, I came back.

58:49.238 --> 58:50.239
Twice.

58:55.118 --> 58:56.662
I'm way more at home here.

59:00.040 --> 59:01.041
Christ.

59:11.093 --> 59:12.177
Come on. Time to go.

59:12.678 --> 59:13.762
Is it over?

59:13.846 --> 59:15.097
Yeah, you're dead.

59:20.811 --> 59:21.979
That wasn't so bad.

59:28.235 --> 59:29.820
Okay, guys. We're heading out.

59:29.903 --> 59:32.155
Wait, hang on. One second.

59:32.948 --> 59:34.533
One breakfast beer, first.

59:35.659 --> 59:37.411
-All right, just one.
-Thanks.

59:37.494 --> 59:40.247
Hey, fellas. Smile.

59:43.584 --> 59:45.711
-Hey.
-Here you go.

59:45.794 --> 59:47.129
-Thank you.
-This is great.

59:47.212 --> 59:48.380
-Anyone else?
-Yeah.

59:48.463 --> 59:50.465
Here, for your scrapbook.

59:51.967 --> 59:54.428
-Don't peel it open for 90 seconds.
-Got it.

59:55.053 --> 59:56.180
Thank you, sir.

1:00:03.812 --> 1:00:05.063
What's he doing?

1:00:05.814 --> 1:00:06.857
What?

1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:08.317
Just smoking a jay?

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:12.196
What if the sergeant finds out?

1:00:12.279 --> 1:00:13.989
The sergeant probably sold it to him.

1:00:16.867 --> 1:00:17.951
Look, Chick.

1:00:18.535 --> 1:00:20.913
Me and my guys
are happy as shit you brought us beer.

1:00:20.996 --> 1:00:24.249
It's the first time I've seen
a couple of the asswipes smile in weeks.

1:00:24.750 --> 1:00:27.961
But we're going out on patrol today,
and you can't come with us.

1:00:28.670 --> 1:00:31.548
I mean, hell,
you don't wanna come with us.

1:00:33.050 --> 1:00:36.386
All right, there'll be choppers coming in
on the LZ in two to three hours,

1:00:36.470 --> 1:00:37.971
once this shit clears up.

1:00:38.055 --> 1:00:39.890
Try to grab the first one out of here.

1:00:40.682 --> 1:00:41.683
Yeah.

1:00:43.101 --> 1:00:44.102
Okay.

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:50.484
Hey. I got something for you.

1:00:59.493 --> 1:01:01.620
Reynolds's girlfriend
wanted me to give these to him.

1:01:03.205 --> 1:01:04.456
Guess you could use them.

1:01:08.669 --> 1:01:10.879
That's not a rock you're sitting on.
That's elephant shit.

1:01:12.923 --> 1:01:14.466
VC trains them to move equipment.

1:01:14.550 --> 1:01:15.551
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:01:16.635 --> 1:01:20.055
Promise me you'll go right to your boat,
Chick. End it here, please.

1:01:21.390 --> 1:01:24.893
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1:01:24.977 --> 1:01:28.730
And I kind of got to go anyway.
I'm running out of time.

1:01:29.815 --> 1:01:31.608
Duggan, let's go. We're moving out!

1:01:32.192 --> 1:01:33.402
Be right there, Sarge.

1:01:35.821 --> 1:01:38.282
Well, thanks for coming
all the way out here, Chick.

1:01:38.782 --> 1:01:41.493
You're probably the only crazy bastard
on earth to do something like this.

1:01:50.127 --> 1:01:52.963
-Hey, stay safe, Ricky.
-Yeah.

1:01:53.463 --> 1:01:55.382
I'll see you back in the neighborhood.

1:02:27.456 --> 1:02:28.665
Don't worry about him.

1:02:30.501 --> 1:02:33.670
Every once in a while you run into a guy
who's too dumb to get killed.

1:03:22.553 --> 1:03:26.765
-Hey, can you take me to Saigon?
-Is that where you're bringing him?

1:03:26.849 --> 1:03:27.891
Bringing who?

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:49.663
Where's the rest of them?

1:03:51.123 --> 1:03:53.000
He said, "Who?"

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:57.880
Listen, Charlie, I want names now.
Who's been helping you?

1:04:02.676 --> 1:04:04.303
He says, "I don't know anything."

1:04:06.054 --> 1:04:09.349
Okay. Strap in!

1:04:09.433 --> 1:04:12.186
Time to see if this piece of shit can fly!

1:04:17.441 --> 1:04:18.692
Now!

1:04:21.069 --> 1:04:22.529
Hey!

1:04:22.613 --> 1:04:27.618
You've got ten seconds
or you're going out the door! I'm serious!

1:04:27.701 --> 1:04:29.661
What the hell are you doing?

1:04:35.083 --> 1:04:36.627
Who's been helping you?

1:04:50.516 --> 1:04:52.518
He swears he don't know anything.

1:04:52.601 --> 1:04:54.603
Well,
tell him he better make something up,

1:04:54.686 --> 1:04:56.021
or he's going out!

1:04:56.104 --> 1:04:58.982
Come on, man!
Just tell him to tell him what he wants!

1:05:15.916 --> 1:05:17.000
We got it!

1:05:17.501 --> 1:05:19.461
Okay! Take her down!

1:06:19.354 --> 1:06:21.315
What's this? This isn't Saigon.

1:06:21.398 --> 1:06:24.318
The hell you talking about?
Your partner told me to land at Kon Tum.

1:06:29.573 --> 1:06:30.699
Who are you again?

1:06:31.575 --> 1:06:33.827
-Just a tourist, like you!
-Yeah?

1:06:36.246 --> 1:06:37.539
Who's your travel agent?

1:06:38.999 --> 1:06:40.083
Same as yours.

1:06:41.543 --> 1:06:43.086
I'll tell the boss you say hi.

1:06:56.517 --> 1:06:58.936
Sorry, sir.
I can't find nothing going to Saigon.

1:06:59.019 --> 1:07:00.187
Well, keep looking, okay?

1:07:00.270 --> 1:07:03.440
I need to be at the harbor by 8:00 a.m.
So I need to get out by tonight.

1:07:03.524 --> 1:07:06.652
I could ask the helicopter you came in on
if he could take you to Saigon.

1:07:08.654 --> 1:07:10.197
No, I can't go on that.

1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:13.325
Somebody blew their lunch
all over the place. It's disgusting.

1:07:15.035 --> 1:07:16.036
What about those ones?

1:07:17.037 --> 1:07:18.330
They're down.

1:07:18.413 --> 1:07:21.667
Got a couple mechanics driving in
from Pleiku air base to pitch in.

1:07:21.750 --> 1:07:23.210
We'll set you up
with a bed in the barracks,

1:07:23.293 --> 1:07:26.588
-get you out tomorrow afternoon.
-I just told you. I have to be back--

1:07:27.172 --> 1:07:28.632
Pleiku, do they have choppers?

1:07:28.715 --> 1:07:30.884
Sure, it's a helicopter base.

1:07:31.468 --> 1:07:34.054
-Well, how far is it?
-Twenty-four klicks due south.

1:07:34.137 --> 1:07:37.099
-In American.
-About 16 miles.

1:07:37.182 --> 1:07:39.977
-Well, can you get me a lift there?
-Not tonight, sir.

1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:42.104
But I can get you a ride back
with the mechanics tomorrow.

1:07:42.187 --> 1:07:44.231
-What if I walk?
-Sixteen miles?

1:07:44.314 --> 1:07:46.984
-Yeah. I could hitch, you know.
-Not advisable, sir.

1:07:47.067 --> 1:07:48.485
The VC own the night on that road.

1:07:57.953 --> 1:08:01.331
All right. Give me a second.
Let me see what I can do.

1:08:03.417 --> 1:08:04.418
Thanks.

1:08:17.389 --> 1:08:18.390
Anything?

1:08:18.473 --> 1:08:20.517
No, but tell you what.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:22.603
I'll give you a lift
over to Pleiku myself.

1:08:23.103 --> 1:08:25.814
Really?
You can just leave your post like that?

1:08:25.898 --> 1:08:28.942
Yeah. As long as I'm back
in an hour or so, I should be okay.

1:08:30.694 --> 1:08:33.279
Amazing. Which way's your head?
I gotta take a leak.

1:08:34.281 --> 1:08:35.698
Last door on the left.

1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:37.826
I'll meet you out front.

1:08:38.327 --> 1:08:39.328
Thank you.

1:09:40.013 --> 1:09:43.642
Shit! He's running! Let's go!

1:11:05.849 --> 1:11:07.601
All right. Let's get out of here.

1:12:21.884 --> 1:12:24.720
Raquel Welch is with us tonight.
Pretty young lady.

1:12:24.803 --> 1:12:25.804
Oh, yeah.

1:12:25.888 --> 1:12:27.431
Yes. I'll drink to that.

1:12:27.514 --> 1:12:28.932
You'll drink to that?

1:12:29.641 --> 1:12:31.059
You'll drink to a…

1:12:31.143 --> 1:12:33.604
You know.
"There's a tree. I'll drink to that."

1:12:34.146 --> 1:12:36.982
What do you think, Chick?
Am I doing the right thing enlisting?

1:12:37.065 --> 1:12:38.901
Of course you're doing
the right thing, Tommy.

1:12:39.985 --> 1:12:43.071
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think
I'm doing the right thing too. Yeah.

1:12:45.741 --> 1:12:46.825
But sometimes, you know…

1:12:48.410 --> 1:12:49.411
What?

1:12:53.332 --> 1:12:54.541
Everything, you know.

1:12:55.167 --> 1:12:59.171
The whole thing is-- It's confusing.

1:12:59.254 --> 1:13:02.216
I mean, all the shit you hear
about what's going on over there,

1:13:02.299 --> 1:13:03.800
and everyone's got
a different point of view.

1:13:03.884 --> 1:13:05.302
Who does?

1:13:05.385 --> 1:13:06.470
Like my uncle Leo.

1:13:06.553 --> 1:13:08.722
He was a flamethrower in World War II.

1:13:08.805 --> 1:13:10.557
Even he said he wouldn't fight in Vietnam,

1:13:10.641 --> 1:13:12.726
because he doesn't even know
who the Nazis are over there.

1:13:13.936 --> 1:13:15.020
There's still Nazis?

1:13:16.063 --> 1:13:17.481
The bad guys.

1:13:19.149 --> 1:13:20.734
Who are we even fighting, huh?

1:13:22.486 --> 1:13:27.991
Well, that would be the Reds, the commies.

1:13:28.075 --> 1:13:30.494
The guys who want to come over
and take over everything.

1:13:30.577 --> 1:13:32.246
Yeah. When I was talking
to your sister's friends,

1:13:32.329 --> 1:13:34.164
they said just the opposite thing.

1:13:34.248 --> 1:13:37.876
They said there are no bad guys.
It's just a revolutionary war.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.211
And the people we're there defending,

1:13:39.294 --> 1:13:41.171
they don't even want us there
in the first place.

1:13:41.255 --> 1:13:43.423
Minogue,
don't listen to my sister's friends.

1:13:43.507 --> 1:13:46.552
I told you-- Columbia morons.

1:13:50.889 --> 1:13:51.890
Hey, Tommy.

1:13:55.435 --> 1:13:58.564
You're going over there
to defend the United States of America.

1:13:59.439 --> 1:14:02.109
How could that possibly not be
the right thing to do?

1:14:04.361 --> 1:14:09.116
Yeah, you're right, Chick.
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

1:15:48.298 --> 1:15:49.341
You fuckin'--

1:16:12.489 --> 1:16:13.490
No! Don't shoot!

1:16:13.574 --> 1:16:16.159
Don't shoot!

1:16:21.582 --> 1:16:25.335
Chickie? Chickie fricking Donohue?

1:16:25.919 --> 1:16:26.920
Who's that?

1:16:28.630 --> 1:16:30.799
-It's McLoone!
-Who?

1:16:30.883 --> 1:16:35.470
Kevin McLoone from Dyckman Street!
Jesus! What the hell are you doing here?

1:16:35.554 --> 1:16:36.722
Loony?

1:16:38.265 --> 1:16:39.308
You know this guy?

1:16:39.391 --> 1:16:41.935
Yeah,
we used to play CYO basketball together.

1:16:42.019 --> 1:16:44.479
Chickie, what the hell? Why are you--
Am I dead?

1:16:44.563 --> 1:16:47.316
Why are you in the middle of the jungle
in the middle of Vietnam?

1:16:47.399 --> 1:16:49.067
Long story.
But the CIA, they're after me, man.

1:16:49.151 --> 1:16:50.861
-But--
-They're trying to kill me.

1:16:51.361 --> 1:16:53.447
The-- What are you talking about?

1:16:53.530 --> 1:16:55.282
The Central Intelligence Agency.

1:16:55.782 --> 1:16:58.952
-They're after me, man.
-So you came to Vietnam?

1:16:59.036 --> 1:17:03.498
No, I came to deliver Duggan and Reynolds
and the other Inwood's guys beers.

1:17:03.582 --> 1:17:06.210
Wait, beers? What do you mean, beers?

1:17:06.293 --> 1:17:07.961
I thought it would be nice
to bring them all beers.

1:17:08.045 --> 1:17:10.339
But now the CIA is after me,

1:17:10.422 --> 1:17:12.466
because I saw shit
that I wasn't supposed to see.

1:17:12.549 --> 1:17:14.051
What did you see?

1:17:14.134 --> 1:17:16.011
They were throwing people
out of helicopters.

1:17:16.094 --> 1:17:19.264
-How'd you know it was CIA?
-Because I was in the chopper with them.

1:17:19.348 --> 1:17:22.059
Wait. You're CIA?

1:17:22.142 --> 1:17:26.188
No. No, what? No, no, no, no, no.
They thought that I was one of them.

1:17:26.271 --> 1:17:27.898
That's because a major came up to me.

1:17:27.981 --> 1:17:30.526
He saw how I was dressed,
so I just-- I went along with it.

1:17:30.609 --> 1:17:32.152
They-- For a second, it--

1:17:32.236 --> 1:17:34.446
Then they started throwing people
out the helicopter.

1:17:34.530 --> 1:17:37.741
And this kid, he said he could drive me
all the way to Pleiku,

1:17:37.824 --> 1:17:39.618
like he could just leave his post.

1:17:39.701 --> 1:17:42.829
But I knew it was bullshit. I knew
it was bullshit. He was setting me up.

1:17:42.913 --> 1:17:46.667
There was a foot long caterpillar
climbing up my arm,

1:17:46.750 --> 1:17:48.627
on my face, almost in my mouth.

1:17:48.710 --> 1:17:50.254
-Okay, buddy.
-It was seriously--

1:17:50.337 --> 1:17:52.005
Hey, take a breath.
Look, get in the Jeep, Chick.

1:17:52.089 --> 1:17:53.966
We got to get the hell out of here
before we get killed.

1:17:54.049 --> 1:17:55.342
-Come on.
-Okay.

1:17:58.011 --> 1:17:59.012
Sorry, guys.

1:17:59.096 --> 1:18:00.764
Can you take me to Pleiku
so I can catch a chopper?

1:18:00.848 --> 1:18:02.057
Right now we're heading to Kon Tum.

1:18:02.140 --> 1:18:04.852
-Just a few miles up. We got to fix--
-What? No, I can't go back there.

1:18:04.935 --> 1:18:07.145
-That's where the CIA is.
-For Chrissakes.

1:18:07.229 --> 1:18:09.147
I have to get to my ship in Saigon
right away.

1:18:09.231 --> 1:18:11.650
I'm sorry, man.
We got orders. We got to get up there.

1:18:11.733 --> 1:18:13.527
All right, fine. Then I'm out.

1:18:14.111 --> 1:18:15.153
Hey.

1:18:16.405 --> 1:18:18.490
Come on, Chick.
Please get back in the Jeep.

1:18:18.574 --> 1:18:19.658
We'll get you back to Saigon,

1:18:19.741 --> 1:18:21.702
and we'll make sure
the CIA doesn't get you.

1:18:21.785 --> 1:18:23.495
No. I'm not going back to Kon Tum.

1:18:24.079 --> 1:18:26.123
I'm not messing around, Kev.

1:18:26.206 --> 1:18:28.625
I'm in big trouble
if I don't get my ass out of this country.

1:18:28.709 --> 1:18:30.502
Look, man.
We don't got no choice, all right?

1:18:30.586 --> 1:18:31.837
We got to go fix those helicopters,

1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:34.298
and if you stay out here alone,
you're a dead man.

1:18:34.798 --> 1:18:36.133
I'll take my chances.

1:18:36.216 --> 1:18:39.469
-Don't be an asshole! Come on.
-No, you don't be an asshole!

1:18:40.679 --> 1:18:44.099
You know me, Loony.
Why would I make up a story like this?

1:18:46.894 --> 1:18:48.937
Please. Kev.

1:18:53.275 --> 1:18:54.776
Mason, turn it around.

1:18:57.029 --> 1:18:58.030
Thank you.

1:19:04.286 --> 1:19:07.331
Hey, what happened to those elephants
back there?

1:19:07.831 --> 1:19:11.084
Napalm.
It's a miracle anything survives out here.

1:19:26.391 --> 1:19:29.436
I'm sorry about this, Kev.
I really appreciate it.

1:19:30.270 --> 1:19:33.148
Hey, it's not every day
you get to help a secret agent in need.

1:19:34.775 --> 1:19:35.859
Hey, Chick.

1:19:37.110 --> 1:19:40.697
I'm real sorry about Tommy Minogue.
I know how tight you guys were.

1:19:41.657 --> 1:19:43.909
It's not over yet.
They just haven't found him.

1:19:46.119 --> 1:19:47.579
Yeah. Okay.

1:19:51.542 --> 1:19:54.253
Stay safe, Loony.
I'll see you back in the neighborhood.

1:20:08.892 --> 1:20:09.977
Hey, Kev.

1:21:08.410 --> 1:21:10.829
Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

1:21:24.510 --> 1:21:26.470
The Drake wasn't
supposed to leave till tomorrow.

1:21:26.553 --> 1:21:29.723
Intel picked up chatter.
Enemy planning a raid.

1:21:29.806 --> 1:21:33.519
With all that ammo on board,
we unloaded her first.

1:21:33.602 --> 1:21:35.103
She's halfway to Manila by now.

1:21:35.187 --> 1:21:39.107
But she can't leave.
I'm her oiler. I run the engine room.

1:21:39.191 --> 1:21:41.610
Well, apparently she doesn't give a shit.

1:21:42.194 --> 1:21:43.946
How can I catch up with it then?

1:21:44.029 --> 1:21:46.073
How fast can you swim?

1:21:46.156 --> 1:21:47.699
This ain't funny, man.

1:21:48.325 --> 1:21:51.411
Can you call the ship or something
and just tell them to stop?

1:21:51.495 --> 1:21:54.122
No, I can't, man.

1:21:54.665 --> 1:21:56.250
Just give me a break.

1:21:56.750 --> 1:21:59.878
I'm a civilian,
and I just need to get out of this war.

1:22:00.462 --> 1:22:03.340
Well, you're gonna find out
it's a lot harder to get out of a war

1:22:03.423 --> 1:22:04.883
than it is to get into one.

1:22:05.425 --> 1:22:07.594
My suggestion, go to your plan B.

1:22:08.178 --> 1:22:11.348
I don't have a plan B.

1:22:11.431 --> 1:22:16.019
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd say you're borked.

1:22:38.876 --> 1:22:41.545
Oklahoma! Oklahoma!

1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:45.215
New York. Happy New Year.

1:22:45.299 --> 1:22:48.093
Thanks.
You're about a month too late, but--

1:22:48.177 --> 1:22:52.639
No. Tonight Tét eve. Vietnam New Year.

1:22:55.475 --> 1:22:57.352
Right. Well, hey, happy New Year.

1:22:57.436 --> 1:22:59.938
Hey. Which way's the US Embassy from here?

1:23:00.689 --> 1:23:03.108
Right around the corner. Cannot miss.

1:23:03.192 --> 1:23:04.318
What corner?

1:23:07.070 --> 1:23:11.158
Come on. I show you.
Nobody listen me here anyway.

1:23:17.456 --> 1:23:20.375
After war, I visit Oklahoma.

1:23:20.876 --> 1:23:21.877
Really?

1:23:22.377 --> 1:23:25.088
Well, I doubt there's a direct flight
from here to Oklahoma,

1:23:25.172 --> 1:23:28.342
so, why don't you stop over in New York,
and I'll buy you a beer?

1:23:28.425 --> 1:23:31.553
Okay. New York people nice? Friendly?

1:23:32.721 --> 1:23:33.889
The best.

1:23:33.972 --> 1:23:35.724
Just don't look them in the eye
on the sidewalk,

1:23:35.807 --> 1:23:36.975
or you might have to fight them.

1:23:38.143 --> 1:23:39.603
There your embassy.

1:23:40.187 --> 1:23:41.772
Thank you.

1:23:41.855 --> 1:23:44.525
Hey. What New York street you live on?

1:23:45.817 --> 1:23:48.403
You serious? You're really coming?

1:23:49.112 --> 1:23:50.697
Unless you not serious?

1:23:51.865 --> 1:23:54.576
No, I'm serious.
Yeah, I'm more serious than you.

1:23:55.786 --> 1:23:57.204
Hey, here's my address.

1:23:59.540 --> 1:24:03.961
And this is my phone number.
Give me a call. This is great.

1:24:04.044 --> 1:24:05.587
You can stay with me and my family.

1:24:05.671 --> 1:24:08.590
You'll meet my dad.
He's a real ballbuster. You'll like him.

1:24:09.174 --> 1:24:10.592
I'm Chickie, by the way.

1:24:10.676 --> 1:24:11.677
Hieu.

1:24:12.177 --> 1:24:14.555
-Hieu. Nice to meet you. Thank you.
-Thank you, Chickie.

1:24:14.638 --> 1:24:15.639
Thank you.

1:24:15.722 --> 1:24:16.807
See you in New York.

1:24:16.890 --> 1:24:18.100
See you there.

1:24:21.728 --> 1:24:22.813
Name.

1:24:22.896 --> 1:24:27.484
Donohue. John Donohue.
I'm American, I'm a merchant mariner.

1:24:27.568 --> 1:24:31.029
My ship, the Drake, left early.
Something about chatter.

1:24:31.113 --> 1:24:33.615
Anyways, it took off without me,
so I'm in a real jam here.

1:24:33.699 --> 1:24:35.993
You're right here. I got a file on you.

1:24:36.493 --> 1:24:37.494
Great.

1:24:37.995 --> 1:24:40.497
The captain of the Drake
left a message for you.

1:24:43.375 --> 1:24:44.376
And…

1:24:44.459 --> 1:24:47.963
The captain said if you're not dead,
he'll take you back on the ship

1:24:48.046 --> 1:24:49.214
if you can catch up with it.

1:24:49.798 --> 1:24:53.218
Well, I'm not dead. So…

1:24:55.179 --> 1:24:57.014
Not dead.

1:24:59.266 --> 1:25:02.519
So, sorry. Hold on. What's going on?
How do I catch up with it?

1:25:03.770 --> 1:25:04.980
You sit.

1:25:16.450 --> 1:25:20.204
I can get you on a flight
out of Bien Hoa Air Base to Manila

1:25:20.287 --> 1:25:21.830
tomorrow night at 1900.

1:25:23.790 --> 1:25:25.000
Thank you.

1:25:25.083 --> 1:25:27.878
Come by tomorrow morning after 10:00,
and I'll have your papers.

1:25:27.961 --> 1:25:29.963
Tomorrow morning after 10:00.

1:25:31.381 --> 1:25:32.966
You're the greatest. Thank you.

1:25:33.550 --> 1:25:36.220
Hey. Do you mind if I lay down
just for 20 more minutes?

1:25:36.303 --> 1:25:38.305
Then I'll be out of your hair, I swear.

1:25:38.388 --> 1:25:40.140
Great. Thank you.

1:25:46.855 --> 1:25:48.524
For the first time in five years,

1:25:48.607 --> 1:25:51.109
firecrackers are ringing in
the Lunar New Year.

1:25:51.860 --> 1:25:53.904
The South Vietnamese Government have…

1:25:53.987 --> 1:25:56.990
I hope you have a safe trip back home.

1:25:59.409 --> 1:26:00.869
How'd you know I was leaving?

1:26:00.953 --> 1:26:02.704
Everyone leaves Saigon.

1:26:02.788 --> 1:26:06.750
First the Chinese, then the French.
Next, the Americans.

1:26:07.876 --> 1:26:10.754
After we fix it up, someone else comes,
knocks it back down.

1:26:11.255 --> 1:26:13.841
You really need to bone up
on your American history, fella.

1:26:13.924 --> 1:26:15.634
Every country America goes to war with,

1:26:15.717 --> 1:26:17.344
we leave it in better shape
than we found it.

1:26:17.427 --> 1:26:20.639
But don't take my word for it,
just ask the Germans and the Japs.

1:26:25.185 --> 1:26:27.104
If the Americans aren't winning,

1:26:27.187 --> 1:26:29.231
then why would Hanoi
call for a cease-fire?

1:26:29.731 --> 1:26:33.485
Maybe it's not a cease-fire.
Maybe the enemy just ran out of bullets.

1:26:34.194 --> 1:26:37.197
I think you're wrong, Arthur.
I think this is the real deal.

1:26:37.281 --> 1:26:39.908
The first steps
towards legitimate peace talks.

1:26:39.992 --> 1:26:42.578
I believe this country wants
what you Americans want.

1:26:43.078 --> 1:26:44.079
I would hope so.

1:26:44.162 --> 1:26:47.082
I mean, half the people in the city
we saved from bombed-out villages.

1:26:47.165 --> 1:26:48.208
We opened our doors to them

1:26:48.292 --> 1:26:49.877
when they were running away
from the commies.

1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:52.212
Maybe they weren't running away
from the commies.

1:26:53.046 --> 1:26:55.257
Maybe they were just running
from the bombs.

1:26:56.133 --> 1:26:58.760
Well, well,
the blustering beer boy is back.

1:26:58.844 --> 1:27:00.345
I agree with him.

1:27:01.847 --> 1:27:04.808
They might smile at us,
but they sure as shit don't want us here.

1:27:04.892 --> 1:27:06.977
Maybe the cease-fire will make them happy.

1:27:07.811 --> 1:27:10.314
Cease-fire.
When does this cease-fire start?

1:27:10.397 --> 1:27:13.483
Three days ago.
There's a truce through New Year's.

1:27:13.567 --> 1:27:16.528
Well, someone forgot to tell that
to the people living up in the woods.

1:27:17.362 --> 1:27:18.697
What are you talking about?

1:27:18.780 --> 1:27:20.991
They're still fighting like crazy
up north.

1:27:21.074 --> 1:27:23.160
-Where'd you hear that?
-I didn't hear it.

1:27:23.744 --> 1:27:24.870
I saw it.

1:27:25.704 --> 1:27:28.999
I was up in the mountains at LZ Jane
with the First Air Cav.

1:27:29.082 --> 1:27:32.461
Rubbish. They haven't let
non-military personnel up there in weeks.

1:27:32.544 --> 1:27:33.962
That may be true,

1:27:34.046 --> 1:27:37.174
but they didn't mention that
when I was up there.

1:27:39.259 --> 1:27:40.677
Let me see that.

1:27:47.726 --> 1:27:50.229
You silly twat. You're serious.

1:27:51.772 --> 1:27:52.773
Yeah.

1:27:55.943 --> 1:27:58.278
Hey, kid.
What did you say your name was again?

1:28:00.072 --> 1:28:02.616
Chickie. Chickie Donohue.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:09.957
Hien, Chickie Donohue is drinking on me.
All night.

1:28:12.709 --> 1:28:16.213
At the same time, Chick,
I see 100 villagers killed

1:28:16.296 --> 1:28:17.923
and only ten guns recovered.

1:28:20.551 --> 1:28:25.931
I know someone, one of our guys,
got trigger happy.

1:28:26.014 --> 1:28:27.683
And I got to report that story too.

1:28:27.766 --> 1:28:30.185
But see, that's the stuff
that the press can't get enough of.

1:28:30.269 --> 1:28:34.147
That's all you guys report.
That's what pisses me off.

1:28:34.231 --> 1:28:36.024
It's not the whole story.

1:28:36.108 --> 1:28:39.778
I don't know. Maybe if some
of you guys lost as many friends as I had,

1:28:39.862 --> 1:28:41.488
you'd feel a little differently.

1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:44.658
Those names behind the bar…

1:28:47.244 --> 1:28:49.997
that's the names of the journalists
who've been killed so far.

1:28:50.497 --> 1:28:54.543
Friends of mine.
Friends of everyone in this room.

1:28:59.882 --> 1:29:02.176
But then why do you guys
just report the bad stuff?

1:29:02.259 --> 1:29:04.052
That's what we hear back home.

1:29:04.136 --> 1:29:06.930
I mean, doesn't that hurt us?
Like, as a country?

1:29:07.014 --> 1:29:09.183
The truth? The truth hurts us? No.

1:29:09.850 --> 1:29:12.895
The truth doesn't hurt us. It's the lies.

1:29:13.478 --> 1:29:18.901
The lies and the conspiracy to distort
the truth, that's what hurts America.

1:29:20.903 --> 1:29:23.071
You've seen the soldiers
we've got out here.

1:29:24.281 --> 1:29:28.577
They're just kids.
Good kids being patriots.

1:29:28.660 --> 1:29:33.207
Doing what their country asks.
And I want the truth told for them.

1:29:33.999 --> 1:29:37.252
The people running this war,
they're not patriots.

1:29:37.961 --> 1:29:41.131
They're politicians.
And they deal in the currency of lies.

1:29:41.215 --> 1:29:42.382
And if the lies continue,

1:29:42.466 --> 1:29:44.510
they're just gonna keep
sending boys out here to be killed

1:29:44.593 --> 1:29:46.136
to justify the boys
who already got killed.

1:29:47.387 --> 1:29:48.639
And every GI that dies…

1:29:50.641 --> 1:29:52.935
is what, 50, 60 Vietnamese?

1:29:53.644 --> 1:29:54.895
And they're not soldiers.

1:29:56.438 --> 1:30:02.569
They're moms and dads.
Children. Little babies.

1:30:12.871 --> 1:30:15.624
You sure got
some weird fireworks out here.

1:30:15.707 --> 1:30:19.002
That ain't fireworks, man.
They're tracer rounds.

1:30:34.268 --> 1:30:36.311
-Where you going?
-The embassy.

1:30:36.395 --> 1:30:38.564
-I'm going with you.
-No, it's too dangerous.

1:30:38.647 --> 1:30:41.149
Hey, I need to get my papers
or I can't fly out tomorrow!

1:30:42.818 --> 1:30:43.986
Come on.

1:30:49.700 --> 1:30:50.826
Wait!

1:31:01.587 --> 1:31:02.754
It could be VC.

1:31:25.569 --> 1:31:27.279
-No, don't shoot.
-Don't move.

1:31:27.863 --> 1:31:28.906
Don't shoot.

1:31:33.368 --> 1:31:34.369
Yeah.

1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:36.371
Hey!

1:31:37.956 --> 1:31:39.917
Wait, yeah?

1:31:46.298 --> 1:31:47.508
Both of us.

1:31:52.971 --> 1:31:55.682
-Yeah?
-Go!

1:31:55.766 --> 1:31:57.059
Come on.

1:32:00.896 --> 1:32:02.648
Soldier, what's the word?

1:32:02.731 --> 1:32:03.941
Saigon's under attack.

1:32:04.024 --> 1:32:06.401
Viet Cong are everywhere.
They got half of Cho Lon.

1:32:06.485 --> 1:32:07.653
We got to get to the embassy.

1:32:07.736 --> 1:32:10.239
Forget it. There's fighting on every block
and Charlie has the embassy!

1:32:10.322 --> 1:32:12.407
-That's not possible.
-Let's move!

1:32:13.867 --> 1:32:16.370
Hey! Can you get us closer to the embassy?

1:32:17.538 --> 1:32:19.915
No, I told you.
Get your asses out of here before you--

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:44.606
Chick!

1:34:36.802 --> 1:34:37.970
Oklahoma?

1:34:39.096 --> 1:34:40.180
Oklahoma!

1:34:46.019 --> 1:34:47.187
Hieu! Hieu!

1:34:54.862 --> 1:34:57.197
Chickie! Get out of the street!

1:35:01.994 --> 1:35:05.038
He's dead! Move!

1:35:31.607 --> 1:35:32.608
No.

1:35:44.828 --> 1:35:45.913
You okay?

1:35:47.789 --> 1:35:49.291
Yeah.

1:35:49.374 --> 1:35:50.709
Don't forget to breathe.

1:36:00.010 --> 1:36:01.053
I had this coming.

1:36:07.851 --> 1:36:09.311
You know, when I was a kid,

1:36:10.062 --> 1:36:13.982
if I did something wrong
like lie to my mother or,

1:36:14.525 --> 1:36:18.070
you know, sneak into the teacher's office
to steal the test answers,

1:36:18.153 --> 1:36:20.113
hocking candy, or whatever…

1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:25.702
God always found a way
to make me pay for it, you know?

1:36:27.788 --> 1:36:33.627
Like, I'd make an error in the big game,
or I'd break my leg or something.

1:36:34.795 --> 1:36:38.382
I'm telling you, man.
I never got away with nothing. Nothing.

1:36:42.052 --> 1:36:43.846
First time I had sex, I got crabs.

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:47.766
She blamed me.

1:36:49.101 --> 1:36:51.228
Smuggling beer into a war zone…

1:36:53.397 --> 1:36:55.816
that's not the smartest thing
I've ever heard of.

1:36:58.610 --> 1:37:00.445
It's certainly not the worst either.

1:37:29.516 --> 1:37:30.517
Hey, Chick.

1:37:32.352 --> 1:37:35.189
Let's go see
what the world looks like today. Come on.

1:38:51.223 --> 1:38:54.017
Coates, you were right.
The cease-fire was bullshit.

1:38:54.810 --> 1:38:58.438
NVA came in with 80,000 troops.
Attacked over 100 cities and towns.

1:38:59.106 --> 1:39:00.357
How did they get in here?

1:39:00.858 --> 1:39:02.484
VC sappers blew the wall open.

1:39:03.735 --> 1:39:04.736
That wall?

1:39:05.279 --> 1:39:09.157
Our guys blew that out.
After the VC was already in here.

1:39:09.241 --> 1:39:12.202
The military just briefed us.
The VC blew it open and piled in.

1:39:13.036 --> 1:39:14.621
The military must be mistaken.

1:39:15.622 --> 1:39:16.832
I saw it with my own--

1:39:20.961 --> 1:39:23.380
Oh, God. Please tell me
we didn't drop an atomic bomb.

1:39:24.006 --> 1:39:27.759
No. Someone just blew
the ammo dump at Long Binh.

1:39:29.344 --> 1:39:31.680
-Shit.
-Where are you going?

1:39:32.264 --> 1:39:34.683
I got a friend in Long Binh!
I got to get over there!

1:39:36.643 --> 1:39:38.520
You don't even know how to get there.

1:39:38.604 --> 1:39:40.189
I'll follow the mushroom cloud!

1:39:41.648 --> 1:39:45.194
Chickie,
they're not gonna let you in. All right?

1:39:45.277 --> 1:39:46.737
They will if I'm with you!

1:39:48.155 --> 1:39:51.909
This one's got keys.
I'm going. Are you coming?

1:39:56.413 --> 1:40:00.417
Push over. Come on. Push over. Hold that.

1:40:10.761 --> 1:40:11.929
I'm telling you,

1:40:12.012 --> 1:40:14.515
I watched one of our tanks pull up
and blast a hole in that wall.

1:40:14.598 --> 1:40:15.599
I believe you.

1:40:15.682 --> 1:40:18.185
Well, then why would the military say
that it was the VC?

1:40:19.770 --> 1:40:23.899
There's a lot of wars going on in Vietnam.
Most of all, the public relations one.

1:40:24.733 --> 1:40:27.819
The enemy blasting a hole
in the wall is an easier sell

1:40:27.903 --> 1:40:30.197
than some kind of VC inside job, you know?

1:41:44.271 --> 1:41:46.440
Hold it, cowboy. Identification.

1:41:46.523 --> 1:41:49.067
Arthur Coates. Look magazine.

1:41:50.277 --> 1:41:51.778
All right. They're clear.

1:41:59.286 --> 1:42:01.872
Just get anything. Get over here and help.

1:42:22.976 --> 1:42:24.436
I'm gonna look for my friend!

1:42:25.312 --> 1:42:26.313
Hey.

1:42:28.148 --> 1:42:31.151
Put this around your neck.
Anybody asks you, just say you're press.

1:42:42.621 --> 1:42:45.290
-Hey! Bobby Pappas. You know him?
-No.

1:42:45.374 --> 1:42:47.584
-New York kid. New York kid.
-No, I'm sorry.

1:42:51.296 --> 1:42:52.923
Do you know where I can find Bobby Pappas?

1:42:53.006 --> 1:42:54.967
No idea, man.
A lot of hurt people out here.

1:42:55.467 --> 1:42:58.554
-Well, is there an infirmary somewhere?
-Yeah, building 8.

1:43:02.724 --> 1:43:03.725
There you go.

1:43:03.809 --> 1:43:05.519
They're gonna take good care of you.

1:43:29.459 --> 1:43:30.836
What are you doing?

1:43:30.919 --> 1:43:32.629
I'm just looking for a friend.

1:43:32.713 --> 1:43:35.174
-You can't be in here.
-It's okay. I'm with the press.

1:43:35.257 --> 1:43:37.301
You think being with the press
makes it okay?

1:43:37.885 --> 1:43:39.178
Get the hell out of here.

1:43:45.100 --> 1:43:47.060
Come on. Give me a break, please.

1:43:47.769 --> 1:43:49.855
I've come all the way from New York
to look for a friend.

1:43:49.938 --> 1:43:51.190
He might have just got killed.

1:43:51.273 --> 1:43:53.275
Just trying to find out
if he's alive or not.

1:43:55.777 --> 1:43:56.987
What's his name?

1:44:01.700 --> 1:44:04.453
Bobby! Holy shit. Thank God.

1:44:05.495 --> 1:44:09.958
Really? They had to flatten
my entire base to get you to visit me?

1:44:10.042 --> 1:44:11.877
Goddamn, it's good to see you.

1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:14.463
Heard a rumor you were coming.
Bringing beer or some shit.

1:44:14.546 --> 1:44:15.464
Yeah.

1:44:17.674 --> 1:44:19.593
How you doing? You okay?

1:44:21.428 --> 1:44:25.390
I'm still alive. Better than nothing.

1:44:27.809 --> 1:44:30.187
You shouldn't be here, Chick.
It's not safe.

1:44:30.270 --> 1:44:33.565
Don't worry,
I got a flight out of Bien Hoa tonight.

1:44:33.649 --> 1:44:36.109
I don't got any papers,
but I'm sure I can weasel my way on.

1:44:36.193 --> 1:44:39.112
There are no flights out of Bien Hoa.
VC torched the place.

1:44:40.030 --> 1:44:41.156
Then where can I fly out?

1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:43.450
You can't. The whole country's
grounded for commercial air.

1:44:43.534 --> 1:44:45.494
Only military's allowed in and out.

1:44:45.577 --> 1:44:47.246
-For how long?
-Who knows?

1:44:51.166 --> 1:44:52.167
Hey.

1:44:54.169 --> 1:44:58.090
It's just a little thank you
from everybody back home.

1:44:59.842 --> 1:45:00.843
For what?

1:45:02.010 --> 1:45:04.680
For what? For this. For all this.

1:45:07.558 --> 1:45:09.309
For putting yourself on the line for us.

1:45:11.395 --> 1:45:13.897
And a goddamn beer's
supposed to make it all okay?

1:45:20.612 --> 1:45:25.158
Listen, Chickie, all right.
I got a ton of shit to do.

1:45:26.285 --> 1:45:29.538
Okay, we got to find a place for you
to lay low before you get yourself killed.

1:45:33.959 --> 1:45:35.586
Do the phones still work around here?

1:45:35.669 --> 1:45:38.088
Okay. Can you just say that for me
one more time?

1:45:40.048 --> 1:45:42.885
Tan Son Nhut.

1:45:43.802 --> 1:45:48.348
Okay, great. Thanks.
Yeah, I will be there. Thank you.

1:45:49.558 --> 1:45:52.144
Is there any way that you can
get me a ride to Tan Son Nhut?

1:45:52.227 --> 1:45:53.061
Why?

1:45:53.145 --> 1:45:55.314
Because I got a connection there,
and he can help me out.

1:45:59.651 --> 1:46:01.528
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.

1:46:02.237 --> 1:46:04.323
Commander General William Westmoreland

1:46:04.406 --> 1:46:07.409
described the embassy attack
as a Viet Cong defeat.

1:46:08.035 --> 1:46:12.414
In my opinion,
this is diversionary to his main efforts,

1:46:12.497 --> 1:46:16.752
which he had planned
to take place in Quang Tri province.

1:46:16.835 --> 1:46:17.961
"Diversionary"?

1:46:19.046 --> 1:46:21.757
They didn't just attack the embassy,
they attacked the whole damn city!

1:46:24.176 --> 1:46:25.552
"Diversionary."

1:46:25.636 --> 1:46:27.971
Chickie. Come on. Let's go.

1:46:44.738 --> 1:46:47.074
-Hey, let's go.
-What?

1:46:48.075 --> 1:46:50.118
-I got us a way out.
-A way out of where?

1:46:50.202 --> 1:46:52.913
Vietnam. I called a friend.
He's pulling some strings for us.

1:46:53.413 --> 1:46:54.998
I don't need to get out of Vietnam.

1:46:55.666 --> 1:46:57.626
What? What are you talking about?

1:46:58.669 --> 1:47:00.337
I'm a war correspondent, Chick.

1:47:01.588 --> 1:47:04.716
This is a war. Somebody's got to be here
to see what's going on.

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:07.845
Well, yeah. I get that. I get that,
but this is just for a few days.

1:47:07.928 --> 1:47:10.597
You can come back
as soon as things cool down.

1:47:10.681 --> 1:47:12.057
Chickie, let's go.

1:47:12.850 --> 1:47:15.644
Don't be dumb, Arthur.
This ain't a war no more.

1:47:17.020 --> 1:47:18.146
It's mass murder.

1:47:20.357 --> 1:47:24.403
That's what war is, Chick.
It's one giant crime scene.

1:47:25.153 --> 1:47:28.866
Come on, Chickie. Let's go.
I got to get back here. I got a job to do.

1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:41.920
Hey, take care of yourself.

1:47:42.838 --> 1:47:43.964
You too, Arthur.

1:47:46.133 --> 1:47:48.385
Hey, when you get home, do me a favor.

1:47:50.429 --> 1:47:51.597
Take a bath.

1:48:18.165 --> 1:48:20.834
This will get you to Manila, sir.
Then you're on your own.

1:48:21.335 --> 1:48:23.462
Thanks, Habershaw.
This is most appreciated.

1:48:23.545 --> 1:48:26.673
Well, we're all on the same team.
At least, I'd like to be.

1:48:26.757 --> 1:48:29.176
I hope you'll let Langley know about this.

1:48:29.259 --> 1:48:30.719
-Langley?
-Headquarters.

1:48:31.428 --> 1:48:35.140
Right. Right, I will.
Actually, I'm gonna write him a letter.

1:48:35.224 --> 1:48:38.352
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:48:49.988 --> 1:48:54.201
Look, Habershaw, I got to come clean.

1:48:56.203 --> 1:48:57.412
I'm not CIA.

1:48:58.288 --> 1:48:59.331
Yeah, right.

1:48:59.414 --> 1:49:01.416
No, really. I'm not.

1:49:03.043 --> 1:49:04.044
You're not?

1:49:05.212 --> 1:49:06.213
No.

1:49:07.339 --> 1:49:08.340
So…

1:49:10.551 --> 1:49:12.594
What are you?

1:49:15.973 --> 1:49:16.974
I'm nothing.

1:49:25.816 --> 1:49:27.776
You guys are the fucking best.

1:49:41.039 --> 1:49:42.499
I don't even want to know.

1:49:45.711 --> 1:49:48.755
Thanks, Pappy. I appreciate
you taking care of me out here.

1:49:49.798 --> 1:49:52.593
-I'll see you back in the neighborhood.
-Yeah, of course.

1:49:52.676 --> 1:49:55.971
You got a good heart, Chickie.
It's your brain that I'm worried about.

1:49:59.266 --> 1:50:01.101
This life's just a crapshoot, huh?

1:50:01.852 --> 1:50:05.189
And assholes like you and me live,
while Reynolds and Minogue die.

1:50:05.272 --> 1:50:07.983
Mate, Tommy could still turn up.

1:50:11.028 --> 1:50:12.654
He's gone, Chick.

1:50:15.073 --> 1:50:17.409
Tommy, they found him.

1:50:27.169 --> 1:50:28.337
You sure?

1:50:30.881 --> 1:50:32.007
Yeah.

1:51:46.582 --> 1:51:48.792
No way! Chickie!

1:51:51.628 --> 1:51:53.130
Get your ass over here.

1:52:01.722 --> 1:52:02.723
Hey.

1:52:05.726 --> 1:52:07.436
Hey, look who it is.

1:52:08.020 --> 1:52:09.021
-Chickie?
-Chickie!

1:52:09.104 --> 1:52:12.399
-Hey.
-Son of a bitch, he lives.

1:52:13.025 --> 1:52:16.028
-He came back to settle his tab.
-No.

1:52:16.612 --> 1:52:18.780
So how was the trip?
You must have had a ball.

1:52:18.864 --> 1:52:22.201
A ball? He was in a war, for Chrissake.
It must have been hell.

1:52:22.284 --> 1:52:23.785
Yeah. I mean, it must have been hell.

1:52:23.869 --> 1:52:26.830
And if you ever want to talk about it,
ever, I'm here for you.

1:52:26.914 --> 1:52:28.373
And if you don't, I won't.

1:52:28.457 --> 1:52:31.001
Jesus Christ.
You flip-flopping son of a bitch.

1:52:32.586 --> 1:52:33.712
I missed you.

1:52:34.713 --> 1:52:37.549
You hear about Tommy?

1:52:41.136 --> 1:52:42.554
The kid died a hero.

1:52:45.599 --> 1:52:47.184
So how was it, Chick? Really.

1:52:48.018 --> 1:52:49.853
Yeah, are we kicking ass and taking names?

1:52:49.937 --> 1:52:50.938
No.

1:52:52.564 --> 1:52:55.108
What? Well, what do you mean?

1:52:56.235 --> 1:52:58.820
I mean, it's tough to make sense
of anything over there.

1:52:58.904 --> 1:53:02.115
Well, that's what war is.
It's a messy business.

1:53:02.199 --> 1:53:07.454
Yeah. Yeah, but Colonel, all due respect,
this is different.

1:53:08.789 --> 1:53:09.790
It's…

1:53:12.459 --> 1:53:13.669
It's chaotic.

1:53:14.253 --> 1:53:16.255
They all are. But it's a controlled chaos.

1:53:16.338 --> 1:53:20.008
Not this time.
The chaos over there isn't under control.

1:53:20.509 --> 1:53:22.469
It's not under control at all.

1:53:24.763 --> 1:53:27.850
Look, I know our granddads and our dads,

1:53:29.518 --> 1:53:31.728
they went over to Europe
to save the world.

1:53:32.855 --> 1:53:36.859
And I would put today's guys
up there with them any day.

1:53:38.694 --> 1:53:39.862
And I mean any day.

1:53:42.281 --> 1:53:46.994
But I'm not so sure
we're saving the world this time.

1:53:53.625 --> 1:54:00.007
Well, right or wrong,
it sounds like you need a drink.

1:54:01.550 --> 1:54:04.136
Chickie, grab a stool. First one's on me.

1:54:04.219 --> 1:54:05.387
Maybe the first couple.

1:54:06.138 --> 1:54:10.559
Thanks.
But I got to go do something first.

1:54:30.871 --> 1:54:31.872
Chickie.

1:54:37.127 --> 1:54:39.588
I'm sorry I couldn't
get these to him, Mrs. Minogue.

1:54:45.052 --> 1:54:46.094
It's okay.

1:54:49.848 --> 1:54:52.184
I'm proud of you
for going over there, Chickie.

1:54:53.727 --> 1:54:55.395
No one else would do that.

1:54:56.730 --> 1:54:57.814
It was pointless.

1:55:00.734 --> 1:55:01.985
It didn't help no one.

1:55:04.404 --> 1:55:07.866
It helped us. Everyone in Inwood.

1:55:14.331 --> 1:55:18.168
It felt good knowing that someone
was over there, checking on our boys.

1:55:20.754 --> 1:55:21.755
Take these.

1:55:23.048 --> 1:55:24.758
Tommy would want you to have them.

1:55:27.469 --> 1:55:28.470
No.

1:55:33.225 --> 1:55:35.227
I'm the one who talked Tommy into going.

1:55:36.979 --> 1:55:39.356
What? No, he wanted to go.

1:55:39.439 --> 1:55:40.899
No, he didn't.

1:55:44.278 --> 1:55:46.697
I knew Tommy was scared. Everyone knew.

1:55:49.324 --> 1:55:51.451
So, I talked him into it.

1:55:56.582 --> 1:55:59.751
I don't know why.
I didn't want him to be afraid.

1:56:05.549 --> 1:56:07.426
But I should have let him be afraid.

1:56:10.846 --> 1:56:13.348
I should have let him listen to himself

1:56:13.432 --> 1:56:14.975
instead of listening to me.

1:56:31.617 --> 1:56:32.701
I'm sorry.

1:57:02.898 --> 1:57:04.858
-Yeah, I think so.
-I can--

1:57:04.942 --> 1:57:06.109
Guys.

1:57:12.199 --> 1:57:13.200
Hey.

1:57:15.118 --> 1:57:16.119
Hey.

1:57:18.497 --> 1:57:20.123
Do you know what you've put us through?

1:57:21.291 --> 1:57:23.919
We've been worried sick.
Don't ever do something like that again.

1:57:25.629 --> 1:57:26.630
I won't.

1:57:28.966 --> 1:57:30.676
So did you give them their stupid beers,

1:57:30.759 --> 1:57:32.719
or did you drink 'em all
before you got there?

1:57:34.972 --> 1:57:36.473
They got the stupid beers.

1:57:39.142 --> 1:57:41.937
Well, I'm sure it meant a lot to them.

1:57:46.400 --> 1:57:47.401
You okay?

1:57:49.820 --> 1:57:51.405
Got to change a few things up.

1:57:52.281 --> 1:57:53.490
Such as?

1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:03.542
A little less drinking.
A little more thinking.

1:58:19.933 --> 1:58:21.518
You really gonna quit drinking?

1:58:22.853 --> 1:58:24.646
I said "less drinking".

1:58:31.778 --> 1:58:33.322
I saved the last one for you.
