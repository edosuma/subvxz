01:53.475 --> 01:55.773
- B.P. is spiking.
- Oh, God, I'm in pain!

01:56.011 --> 01:57.638
- When did it start?
- Last night.

01:58.013 --> 01:59.446
Is your wife due soon?

02:00.315 --> 02:02.647
- Not for another 5 weeks.
- I'm fine,

02:03.184 --> 02:05.152
- I'm getting better. I'm getting better.
- What's the B.P.?

02:05.387 --> 02:06.479
Still high.

02:06.888 --> 02:08.479
We can fix it, don't worry.

02:09.924 --> 02:11.255
Nolan... Nolan...

02:11.693 --> 02:12.298
What?

02:12.324 --> 02:14.744
Tell me something, please.
Tell me anything.

02:15.163 --> 02:17.290
You're gonna be okay.
Alright?

02:18.733 --> 02:20.534
I want you to lay back down.

02:20.535 --> 02:21.935
- Okay.
- Lay back down and breathe.

02:22.470 --> 02:23.368
Just breathe.

02:24.372 --> 02:25.396
Wait here.

02:29.244 --> 02:30.370
Oh, my baby!

02:34.549 --> 02:38.349
Do think a strong category 4 or a 5...

02:38.486 --> 02:43.355
so certainly devastating...

02:43.491 --> 02:46.392
deaths which occurred at the cone,
which you'll see in a moment.

02:46.561 --> 02:49.792
The cone will cross
right through New Orleans,

02:50.131 --> 02:55.159
but as of 5 am Central time
just, look at this storm.

02:55.437 --> 02:59.806
I mean, meteorologically speaking it
really is a perfect hurricane

03:00.475 --> 03:03.467
with high cloud tops high and visible.

03:12.487 --> 03:15.388
Oh, my God.
Everyone move to the lobby upstairs!

03:15.523 --> 03:18.390
O.R. lobby! O.R. lobby!
Take the stairs! Second floor.

03:19.561 --> 03:20.789
Let's go. Let's go!

03:27.035 --> 03:29.435
Sir? I need you to go upstairs.

03:32.307 --> 03:33.587
The Doctor told me to wait here.

03:33.975 --> 03:36.842
I understand, but the doctors will know
where to find you. Okay?

04:07.442 --> 04:10.969
Just before dawn Katrina heads
north west straight for the coast.

04:11.212 --> 04:14.306
Down a hair from its 175 miles
per hour peak,

04:14.516 --> 04:17.076
and New Orleans buckles in
for a bumpy ride...

04:25.493 --> 04:26.926
Manuel Diego!

04:27.929 --> 04:29.897
Is there a Manuel Diego here?

04:39.307 --> 04:41.537
Mister Hayes?
Walk with me.

04:48.082 --> 04:49.049
So, how is she?

04:49.451 --> 04:51.715
It is a she. Did you know that?

04:52.654 --> 04:53.814
What? Know what?

04:54.355 --> 04:55.481
You have a baby girl.

04:56.991 --> 04:58.049
A girl?

04:58.927 --> 05:00.447
Let me show you
where we're keeping her

05:00.495 --> 05:03.362
but do know that we'll need to monitor her
for the next few days.

05:03.832 --> 05:07.529
The NICU is, is overcrowded
so I've got her in a private room.

05:08.670 --> 05:11.138
Okay. So, how's Abigail doing?

05:14.075 --> 05:18.569
We transfused all that we had.
I want you to know that.

05:19.414 --> 05:22.349
Doctor Mendolson
and I we did all we could, but...

05:23.852 --> 05:26.343
her liver had given up.

05:27.455 --> 05:28.422
She bled out.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.487
I'm sorry.

05:34.128 --> 05:35.493
Okay. Okay, so...?

05:36.164 --> 05:37.324
Mister Hayes.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.298
I'm really sorry.

05:41.436 --> 05:43.370
She expired at seven this morning.

05:47.408 --> 05:48.568
Not Abby.

05:49.644 --> 05:50.269
No.

05:50.478 --> 05:55.006
- I'm sorry.
- Not my Abby. She's fine. Tell me she's fine.

05:57.252 --> 05:58.552
Tell me she's fine.

05:58.553 --> 06:01.716
I swear to God you better tell me
she's fine right now.

06:02.390 --> 06:06.383
Just tell me she's okay. Let's just,
let's go see her. She's okay, right?

06:06.494 --> 06:07.893
Mister Hayes, let...

06:09.797 --> 06:11.924
Don't touch me, though.
I want you to tell me.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.395
Just tell me she's okay.

06:15.403 --> 06:19.134
- I'm sorry, Mister Hayes.
- No, not sorry. I don't want sorry. I want...

06:44.966 --> 06:46.126
Mister Haynes,

06:54.642 --> 06:56.371
let me take you to see your daughter.

07:00.248 --> 07:01.272
Yeah.

07:07.522 --> 07:08.614
Here at the end.

07:18.266 --> 07:19.392
There she is.

07:21.669 --> 07:22.829
What is this?

07:23.504 --> 07:25.131
This is a ventilator.

07:26.808 --> 07:29.368
Your daughter hasn't yet learned
how to breathe on her own, so...

07:29.510 --> 07:30.909
this is giving her a little help.

07:31.713 --> 07:34.876
Now we got an I.V. drip
to feed her nutrients and...

07:35.850 --> 07:37.943
she'll be big and healthy
before you know.

07:40.455 --> 07:41.479
You have any questions?

07:44.092 --> 07:45.389
How's Abigail?

07:53.968 --> 07:59.463
- I'm gonna give you something, It'll help you.
- No. Listen to me.

08:01.509 --> 08:03.875
I'm okay.
It was just a stupid question.

08:05.246 --> 08:07.407
It's okay. It's alright.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.842
I'm gonna have a nurse check on you.

08:12.587 --> 08:14.487
How long will this baby
need the machine?

08:15.690 --> 08:19.182
Your daughter?
The best guess is... 48 hours.

08:19.527 --> 08:20.926
But it's still too early to tell.

08:21.496 --> 08:23.816
You'll know you're out of danger is
when she starts crying.

08:24.432 --> 08:27.401
The first time she does
it's always a good sound.

08:28.336 --> 08:30.668
- I'll be back.
- Alright. And, Doctor Edmonds...

08:31.406 --> 08:33.405
with this storm are you gonna be
moving people out?

08:33.408 --> 08:34.432
It's a hurricane.

08:35.176 --> 08:39.203
Look, people are gonna tell you it's better
at Charity, or Lindy Boggs.

08:39.614 --> 08:43.607
It won't be. Stay with your daughter,
Mister Hayes. Okay?

09:12.513 --> 09:14.174
I don't know you.

09:21.289 --> 09:24.649
I'm panicky. It's just going bad for me. I
see a gun and I see this guy going for it,

09:24.826 --> 09:26.384
so I start wrestling with him
the best that I can.

09:26.527 --> 09:28.495
Mind you? This is all happening
in the middle of the day,

09:28.496 --> 09:30.361
right outside of the bank,
in the parking lot. Sorry.

09:30.465 --> 09:32.330
- That's when I rob all my banks.
- Hush.

09:32.533 --> 09:34.524
So the driver gets out of the car
and he comes running over.

09:34.769 --> 09:37.067
Meanwhile I'm playing keep-away
with the guy for the gun,

09:37.805 --> 09:40.865
- but the driver doesn't go for the gun.
- He goes for the money.

09:41.242 --> 09:41.842
The duffel bag.

09:42.009 --> 09:45.274
So he grabs the duffel bag,
the driver, and he runs back to the car.

09:45.446 --> 09:50.509
- Mean while Mr. pantyhose face is screaming...
- He was, like, "Larry! Larry don't you dare!"

09:50.752 --> 09:53.915
Yeah. So, Larry, the getaway driver,
hightails it out of there.

09:54.288 --> 09:57.929
He's peeling out, he's just about to the street
when this little car comes out of nowhere...

09:58.126 --> 10:00.492
- My car is not that little.
- It's a little car.

10:00.628 --> 10:02.061
It got the job done, didn't it?

10:02.163 --> 10:07.157
- You wanna tell the story or should I finish?
- Anyway, I get out, I run over,

10:07.335 --> 10:09.269
and I mace him
as he's getting out of his car.

10:09.437 --> 10:10.529
Yeah, it was hairspray.

10:11.005 --> 10:14.441
- There's no mace about it. That was hairspray.
- I blinded him and he couldn't run.

10:15.243 --> 10:18.478
I did my job. And the police got there
shortly afterwards and...

10:18.479 --> 10:20.470
- we saved the day... Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:20.648 --> 10:21.729
- That's how we met.
- Yeah.

10:23.117 --> 10:24.311
Oh my god you two.

10:24.519 --> 10:27.317
- You're like an old married couple.
- I worry about your kids.

10:29.090 --> 10:31.170
- Oh, we're not having kids.
- No, we're not married.

13:09.850 --> 13:11.147
Abby.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.511
I don't want the baby now.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.082
I want you back.

13:21.128 --> 13:22.527
I want you.

13:26.033 --> 13:27.193
Please...

13:32.573 --> 13:33.437
Sir?

13:34.442 --> 13:35.739
You can't be back here.

13:39.513 --> 13:40.912
She's my wife.

13:43.985 --> 13:45.247
She's my wife

13:46.687 --> 13:49.383
I'm sorry.
But this area is off limits.

13:50.191 --> 13:51.992
Well, she shouldn't be
on the floor like this.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.721
We're running short on staff today,
there's a backlog.

13:55.730 --> 13:58.392
Well, whatever, let's get a body bag or
something, we'll put her in a body bag...

13:58.466 --> 14:00.525
There really isn't anywhere else
for her to go.

14:00.735 --> 14:03.735
It will only take a minute. Let's just
get her on some higher ground please.

14:03.971 --> 14:05.336
Come on, get her feet.

14:06.407 --> 14:07.533
Okay.

14:18.886 --> 14:20.148
Thank you.

14:22.757 --> 14:23.883
I mean that.

14:25.092 --> 14:26.184
It's okay.

14:29.463 --> 14:30.953
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:33.401 --> 14:34.629
How did she die?

14:38.572 --> 14:40.335
Giving birth to our daughter.

14:42.510 --> 14:43.909
Well, at least you have a child.

14:45.046 --> 14:46.172
That's good news.

14:48.549 --> 14:52.041
Thousands of others sound sleep
when the noise started.

14:55.523 --> 14:59.050
It was Katrina hammering away
at the roof, trying to get in.

14:59.794 --> 15:02.922
You have one saved message.

15:04.331 --> 15:07.960
Hey love. I know I said I was okay
but my heart is racing and, okay,

15:08.936 --> 15:13.930
so, should we chance that out to the hospital,
or do we try to get out of town, because I,

15:14.475 --> 15:16.636
I don't know if it's just nerves
or something serious.

15:17.211 --> 15:18.678
You decide. I trust you.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.711
To replay this message, press...

15:22.016 --> 15:25.417
Hey love. I know I said I was okay
but my heart is racing and, okay,

15:26.520 --> 15:31.856
so, should we chance that out to the hospital,
or do we try to get out of town, because I,

15:32.326 --> 15:34.487
I don't know if this is just nerves
or something ser...

15:44.772 --> 15:46.569
- Mister Hayes?
- Uh, yeah.

15:46.807 --> 15:48.331
Hi. I'm Shelly.

15:48.509 --> 15:49.373
Hi. Nolan.

15:49.810 --> 15:52.244
This is my turf, so if you need anything,
you let me know.

15:52.413 --> 15:55.405
- Okay.
- Okay? And I've got something for you.

15:58.252 --> 16:00.015
It's your daughter's birth certificate.

16:09.930 --> 16:11.227
You have a name for her?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.399
No. We talked about it.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.267
I liked Haley.

16:18.405 --> 16:20.999
But my wife liked anything but Haley.

16:23.744 --> 16:24.676
Yeah.

16:26.947 --> 16:30.747
Well, Katrina seems to be
a popular name right now.

16:34.488 --> 16:38.151
You know,
ah... Abby's favorite place...

16:38.592 --> 16:39.923
my wife, she...

16:40.794 --> 16:43.957
she really liked this tree,
it was in a park by our house...

16:47.434 --> 16:49.994
a few years ago,
it was struck by lightning.

16:51.038 --> 16:52.471
We'd have picnics there.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.008
She always said it was a safe haven.

16:55.643 --> 16:57.235
Because of that old saying that...

16:57.511 --> 17:01.470
- lightning never strikes twice in the same place...
- Yeah. Right.

17:07.387 --> 17:08.752
Do you think that's real?

17:10.523 --> 17:11.512
About lightning?

17:13.294 --> 17:16.593
Well, yeah, I suppose so.

17:22.869 --> 17:24.861
Well, maybe is not just lightening.

17:38.118 --> 17:42.316
- What happens if the power goes out?
- The generators will kick in. We'll be okay.

17:42.790 --> 17:46.385
This place has weathered storms before. And
most of our equipment has battery backup.

17:46.794 --> 17:47.783
Alright.

17:55.536 --> 17:57.003
It's gonna be okay.

17:57.771 --> 17:58.965
Thank you.

17:59.873 --> 18:00.840
You're welcome.

18:33.207 --> 18:35.675
You heard her.
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:03.437 --> 19:05.632
- Hey, what's going on?
- Come on, we gotta go.

19:11.245 --> 19:13.406
- This way people!
- Alright, everyone stay together.

19:15.249 --> 19:18.116
- Hey, what's going on?
- Evacuating. We got three drivers. Come on.

19:41.909 --> 19:43.638
Everyone to the rear entrance.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.105
- Hey, Doctor Edmonds?
- Mister Hayes.

19:48.615 --> 19:51.215
- I thought you said it was bad everywhere.
- This is not my call.

19:52.119 --> 19:53.711
Calm and orderly, please!

19:54.121 --> 19:55.801
Is there something wrong
with the hospital?

19:56.190 --> 19:58.124
We're overcrowded and understaffed.

19:58.292 --> 20:01.318
The administration just got nervous,
that's all. It's just a partial evacuation.

20:01.428 --> 20:03.521
Okay. Then what are you gonna do
with my daughter?

20:03.964 --> 20:05.226
That ventilator isn't portable.

20:05.566 --> 20:08.933
If they order a full evacuation, we'll
get you a private ride to Charity. Okay?

20:09.236 --> 20:11.397
- So, you come back then?
- No, I'm not leaving.

20:11.839 --> 20:13.466
If there's something I can do,
just let me know.

20:13.707 --> 20:14.469
Sure.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.035
Stop the storm.

20:16.877 --> 20:17.901
Let's move!

20:40.434 --> 20:43.460
Hey! You missed the party, man.

20:44.571 --> 20:45.833
Yeah, it looks like it.

20:46.573 --> 20:47.471
You going to Charity?

20:48.575 --> 20:49.439
What?

20:49.510 --> 20:51.501
Charity Hospital, man.
People are leaving.

20:52.279 --> 20:54.440
No. I have to stay here.

20:54.915 --> 20:57.035
You know we're closing the cafeteria
in a few minutes.

20:57.718 --> 20:59.238
Do you think you can get me some food?

20:59.253 --> 21:01.619
No, man.
The nurses took what was left. Sorry.

21:04.591 --> 21:06.684
You think maybe
you can get some coins?

21:11.932 --> 21:13.365
The ones on the first floor,

21:13.534 --> 21:17.197
they're gonna be picked over,
but if you take the stairs up to four,

21:17.838 --> 21:19.999
there's gonna be a little waiting
area outside surgery.

21:20.107 --> 21:21.131
Okay. Thank you.

21:21.508 --> 21:23.069
They're sending me out on the next bus.

21:23.444 --> 21:27.175
Tulane they got food, but no cooks.

21:28.248 --> 21:30.443
- Alright. Well, good luck.
- You too.

21:34.521 --> 21:35.510
Wait.

21:36.957 --> 21:38.254
Some luncheon meat.

21:38.792 --> 21:41.317
No bread, but salami, some turkey...

21:42.396 --> 21:43.363
Take it, man.

21:44.465 --> 21:48.299
- Nah. No. I can't take your food.
- I don't need it like you do.

21:56.410 --> 21:57.502
I was about to get mad.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.812
- I appreciate it.
- Don't eat that all at once, though.

22:24.872 --> 22:26.533
Yeah, finally some good news.

22:27.641 --> 22:31.407
A levy that has broken on Lake
Pontchartrain from New Orleans.

22:31.879 --> 22:35.440
This is new video that we have just gotten
in, we're seeing it for the first time.

22:35.816 --> 22:38.250
Nothing to stop this water
from just pouring in right now...

22:53.000 --> 22:53.967
Hey!

22:56.136 --> 22:57.433
Hey!

22:57.871 --> 22:58.929
What the hell is that?

23:13.887 --> 23:15.115
What's that?

23:44.484 --> 23:45.678
No, no, no, no!

23:53.627 --> 23:56.687
Yes... Okay.

24:06.006 --> 24:06.938
No.

24:08.308 --> 24:09.798
No, don't do this to me.

24:11.712 --> 24:13.270
Stupid machine.

24:15.682 --> 24:16.478
No.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.616
No. Hey! Hey,
we got a bad battery in here!

24:20.654 --> 24:23.680
Hey, is anybody on this floor?
Nurse?

24:32.766 --> 24:35.326
I need a battery.
Battery. Battery.

24:36.003 --> 24:37.231
Alright, hold on.

24:52.953 --> 24:53.885
Alright.

24:59.359 --> 25:00.451
I hear you'!

25:02.429 --> 25:03.396
I hear you'!

25:11.571 --> 25:13.402
Come on, you, stupid battery!

25:19.479 --> 25:19.843
Won't hold a charge.

25:20.247 --> 25:22.715
Hey! Can somebody
get their ass in here, please?!

25:23.283 --> 25:24.443
I could really use some help!

25:25.552 --> 25:26.917
Hey, is anybody here?!

25:28.488 --> 25:30.388
Oh, my God!
The first floor's flooding.

25:32.759 --> 25:34.317
Hey, we're in 204.

25:36.229 --> 25:37.958
Room 204, please!

25:41.468 --> 25:42.730
Somebody please!

25:54.815 --> 25:55.509
Nolan?

25:55.882 --> 25:56.746
Shelly.

25:59.519 --> 26:00.679
The levees broke.
The streets are flooding.

26:00.954 --> 26:03.195
The back entrance is still okay.
You can go out that way.

26:03.356 --> 26:06.519
No, wait. We gotta get her out of here then.
We gotta get out the whole thing.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.040
The battery's old and it's only taking a small charge.
If you look at it, it's only good for 3 minutes.

26:12.532 --> 26:13.132
Move her where?

26:13.400 --> 26:15.391
We could roll it out.
Put it on the bus and get it out.

26:15.469 --> 26:16.493
There's no buses.

26:18.638 --> 26:22.279
We can go up a couple of floors, go to the roof
top and wait for a helicopter to come and...

26:22.442 --> 26:25.468
No. The power is out and we can't get that
thing up the stairs by ourselves.

26:25.812 --> 26:29.013
We'll have to wait 'til the power comes
back on and then we'll get you a Medevac.

26:30.317 --> 26:33.013
- What, so we're stranded here?
- Just until power comes back.

26:33.553 --> 26:34.952
Where's Doctor Edmonds at?

26:35.522 --> 26:36.420
He left an hour ago.

26:37.190 --> 26:39.522
- What?
- He went with some of the ICU patients.

26:39.726 --> 26:42.887
He was going to come back with the bus
drivers, but then the levees broke and...

26:44.197 --> 26:45.027
Shit!

26:45.532 --> 26:46.294
Pump!

26:46.566 --> 26:47.687
Okay, well, I'm not leaving!

26:48.068 --> 26:51.731
Shelly listen, I'm not leaving,
so, think about it.

26:52.172 --> 26:55.073
What else could we do?
Come here. What else can we do?

26:56.009 --> 26:56.771
Okay.

26:57.477 --> 26:58.239
What?

27:00.514 --> 27:01.503
I'll go get help.

27:02.215 --> 27:04.445
Okay? Just hang in there.

27:04.718 --> 27:05.810
Yeah. Well, okay. Go.

27:06.052 --> 27:07.110
- Okay?
- Yes. Please, go. You're right.

27:07.354 --> 27:10.482
Go, please, but, hurry, Shelly.
Come on, alright? Hurry!

27:26.773 --> 27:30.106
I'm told that the New Orleans Police put out
a call to all of its officers saying...

27:30.343 --> 27:32.641
if you have a boat bring it here, help us.

27:32.879 --> 27:36.576
But the officers who have boats
cannot get to them in many cases,

27:36.883 --> 27:39.215
because the roads are floaded
to their homes.

27:55.068 --> 27:56.389
I don't think you want some, huh?

27:58.638 --> 28:01.607
You don't. It's not good for babies.
That's the good stuff.

28:03.210 --> 28:04.609
That's what's good for you.

28:06.513 --> 28:07.707
You like it, don't you?

28:35.308 --> 28:36.400
No.

28:48.588 --> 28:53.355
I'm not going crazy,
I just feel like talking.

29:00.634 --> 29:03.000
Your mother,

29:03.970 --> 29:05.870
she had a hard time sleeping at night.

29:07.908 --> 29:09.341
But in the day time,

29:11.044 --> 29:13.774
she was this real force of nature,
she just...

29:15.415 --> 29:18.213
She ran her own business, and...

29:21.321 --> 29:23.949
She carried herself like
a drill sergeant, you know.

29:25.225 --> 29:26.351
She...

29:28.628 --> 29:30.220
she was bulletproof.

29:31.765 --> 29:33.130
That's what she was.

29:34.234 --> 29:36.361
But at night she had these...

29:41.107 --> 29:43.075
she'd have these stress dreams and...

29:46.446 --> 29:48.471
I'd lay there in bed and...

29:49.649 --> 29:52.914
I would, I would just say anything really,
I'd tell her how much I loved her,

29:53.887 --> 29:56.321
and I would tell her how
everything was going to be okay.

29:57.190 --> 29:58.316
And...

30:02.595 --> 30:07.498
you know, most of the times,
she'd sleep the entire night through.

30:15.008 --> 30:16.669
You would have really loved her.

30:32.492 --> 30:34.357
Let's see what else we got.

30:57.484 --> 30:58.610
Baby blanket?

31:01.388 --> 31:03.913
Latex gloves. What are these?

31:10.263 --> 31:11.389
Diapers.

31:12.732 --> 31:15.493
I didn't even think about that.
You probably need your diaper changed.

31:16.636 --> 31:18.467
We got daddy diaper directions.

31:21.374 --> 31:23.399
We don't need you.
Go away.

31:24.878 --> 31:26.470
Little diapers for a little baby.

31:31.117 --> 31:32.448
Why isn't that working?

31:37.724 --> 31:40.386
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is bad.

31:41.361 --> 31:44.762
God! What has your Mom
been feeding you? Charcoal?

31:50.870 --> 31:52.471
Alright.
Let's get this one out of there.

31:52.906 --> 31:54.601
Okay. Where am I putting this?

31:56.810 --> 31:58.801
Let's get a couple of pieces going.

32:07.153 --> 32:10.122
How does that feel?
Does it feel alright?

32:13.326 --> 32:17.422
Someone please get the next one.
'Cause I am tapped out.

32:45.725 --> 32:47.852
Did they give you one of these
reports to fill in?

32:48.828 --> 32:49.590
No.

32:50.096 --> 32:52.530
God! I hate paperwork.

32:54.033 --> 32:55.432
I'm Nolan, by the way.

32:55.568 --> 32:56.330
Abigail.

32:56.402 --> 32:58.336
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.698
I got suckered. I thought they were gonna
deputize me or something. What a gyp.

33:04.244 --> 33:05.805
Yeah, I don't think it works like that.

33:06.346 --> 33:08.906
Well it should.
I totally stopped that getaway driver.

33:09.249 --> 33:10.511
- You saw that, right?
- No, No, I saw that.

33:10.683 --> 33:11.809
- That was really good work.
- Yeah.

33:12.051 --> 33:14.952
- Yeah. You've done that before.
- Yeah, clearly.

33:17.590 --> 33:20.991
Maybe you can get a reward too.
For walking into the other guy.

33:21.427 --> 33:24.521
- Oh, you mean the guy with the gun.
- Yeah, that one.

33:24.764 --> 33:26.026
- That guy.
- That guy.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.497
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:28.535 --> 33:30.127
What if I don't wanna be deputized?

33:31.404 --> 33:32.803
Well then what are you asking for?

33:34.073 --> 33:35.005
Dinner.

33:37.677 --> 33:38.803
That sounds lovely.

33:39.145 --> 33:40.772
Okay. Alright, but I'm driving.

33:41.247 --> 33:42.509
- Oh, yeah?
- I just figure,

33:42.682 --> 33:46.516
in case on the way we see a jaywalker and you, all
of a sudden, get this urge to run him over...

33:46.586 --> 33:47.245
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:47.487 --> 33:49.088
- Really? ...You had to go there.
- Yeah.

33:49.289 --> 33:51.289
- Yeah, we gotta avoid that stuff.
- You know what?

33:51.357 --> 33:53.325
When I'm deputy tat's gonna be legal.

33:59.532 --> 34:03.992
Yeah, we had our first date that night and then,
what, a month later we moved in together.

34:05.972 --> 34:08.532
Everyone thought we were being crazy, but,

34:09.475 --> 34:11.306
I don't know, it just felt right with her.

34:12.478 --> 34:14.775
I don't know how else to say it.
It just felt right.

34:19.452 --> 34:22.614
That's not even the best story.
When I proposed...

34:24.424 --> 34:25.482
What?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.327
What now?

34:35.335 --> 34:36.302
Shit!

34:39.005 --> 34:40.063
No.

34:42.375 --> 34:43.342
You're kidding.

34:45.277 --> 34:46.245
You're kidding.

34:47.614 --> 34:49.775
Shit! Alright, I'll be back.

35:13.273 --> 35:14.240
Okay.

35:24.350 --> 35:25.339
Shit!

35:28.888 --> 35:29.855
Yeah.

35:34.961 --> 35:37.327
Yeah. Yeah.

35:40.466 --> 35:41.490
The sticker.

35:42.669 --> 35:43.533
Shit.

35:44.237 --> 35:44.999
Okay.

35:46.172 --> 35:48.436
Okay. Okay, okay, okay,

35:52.245 --> 35:54.110
Dammit wait! Wait!

36:00.586 --> 36:01.610
Are you kidding me?

36:07.226 --> 36:08.955
Bingo! Bingo!

36:22.008 --> 36:22.975
Good.

36:40.426 --> 36:41.450
Orange ones.

36:43.496 --> 36:45.191
Okay, good. Okay, good.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.159
Grab some more.

36:49.869 --> 36:51.359
One more over there.

36:52.438 --> 36:54.804
I got the orange ones.
I got the orange ones!

36:56.075 --> 36:56.939
Hold on, baby.

37:00.446 --> 37:01.470
Okay,

37:03.616 --> 37:07.950
Alright. I can do this.
That's right.

37:09.255 --> 37:10.313
Yeah.

37:26.205 --> 37:27.763
Good.

37:39.552 --> 37:40.883
I'm back.

37:41.454 --> 37:43.251
Everything's gonna be all right,
sweetheart.

37:47.393 --> 37:50.920
Yeah, everything's gonna be okay.

37:53.399 --> 37:55.492
And those problems are likely
to linger, Brian.

37:55.935 --> 37:58.733
The water is a problem for,
throughout the metro area.

37:59.038 --> 38:02.872
People are being told to boil it
and electricity is also the problem.

38:03.109 --> 38:07.569
Hardly anybody has it and isn't
likely to have it for up to a month.

38:11.551 --> 38:13.075
This is your Mom.

38:13.786 --> 38:15.879
She was on a panel at a convention.

38:16.989 --> 38:20.720
And... the convention
was on event planning,

38:24.130 --> 38:28.157
It was really just an event
to discuss planning other events.

38:33.172 --> 38:35.072
I keep this picture because...

38:37.176 --> 38:39.872
she'd argue that she didn't look cute
when she was angry.

38:40.446 --> 38:42.505
And she used to hate it
when I told her that.

38:48.354 --> 38:49.343
Yeah.

38:51.557 --> 38:52.990
Pretty cute, huh?

38:57.530 --> 38:59.725
Let me see what else we have.

39:01.434 --> 39:02.765
I hear you.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.040
Okay, here we go.

39:15.882 --> 39:18.510
This is when I proposed to your Mom.

39:19.685 --> 39:24.122
Let me preface by saying that
before I started dating your mother...

39:24.323 --> 39:26.348
she hated the idea of marriage.

39:27.393 --> 39:30.362
She said it was
"the death of the individual."

39:32.231 --> 39:37.191
Yeah. So she plans this romantic
getaway to this beach.

39:38.638 --> 39:40.162
It was really a business write-off

39:40.573 --> 39:42.973
because the hotel was trying
to get her to host events there.

39:43.910 --> 39:48.904
And... I don't know, I just thought it'd be
a perfect time to pop the question, so...

39:51.150 --> 39:52.947
I had my grandmother's ring restored.

39:55.388 --> 39:59.722
They gave these to me
before your mother went into labor.

40:10.603 --> 40:11.763
You know.

40:26.953 --> 40:29.421
Well, we went to dinner that night.

40:30.389 --> 40:31.686
And it was this...

40:32.525 --> 40:34.652
it was a fancy restaurant
at the end of this pier.

40:37.196 --> 40:41.428
It was perfect, really, so,
you know, the drink order came and...

40:42.735 --> 40:45.932
I dropped to one knee,
pulled the ring out...

40:47.473 --> 40:48.565
she got mad.

40:50.509 --> 40:52.773
She got so mad at me,

40:53.312 --> 40:55.439
her nostrils flaring, all-the-way mad.

40:58.050 --> 40:59.449
I didn't know what was going on.

40:59.518 --> 41:01.509
She gets up and she throws
her napkin down on the table.

41:01.587 --> 41:04.112
I thought I was gonna shatter
into a million pieces.

41:04.957 --> 41:06.754
That's why I asked her.
"What's wrong?"

41:09.562 --> 41:11.086
And she pulled out this ring.

41:13.265 --> 41:15.563
She said,
"You, idiot, I was gonna propose to you!"

41:18.037 --> 41:22.406
That's when this roving photographer
snapped this photo of us.

41:27.513 --> 41:28.980
What else do I have?

41:39.525 --> 41:41.686
You know that's somebody
I would have liked you to met.

41:43.496 --> 41:44.986
You two are quite alike, really.

41:53.205 --> 41:55.537
This here? This is your life.

42:00.546 --> 42:01.506
This is you at 3 months.

42:01.814 --> 42:04.476
Kinda look like you're laying in a hammock.
You think?

42:08.154 --> 42:09.121
Let's see what we got.

42:09.989 --> 42:11.709
Oh, this is when you had us really worried.

42:11.757 --> 42:13.958
You were trying to get all your nutrients
from your Mom.

42:14.527 --> 42:16.995
You were doing the best you could,
but, we didn't know.

42:17.363 --> 42:20.161
This was a month later.
You see that?

42:20.433 --> 42:23.834
Your Mom was on this crazy diet,
she was taking vitamins and supplements,

42:24.036 --> 42:26.996
everything that she could to keep you
healthy and you just kept hanging on.

42:29.108 --> 42:29.789
You're a fighter.

42:30.443 --> 42:31.967
That's what the Doctors kept saying.

42:35.681 --> 42:37.239
Kinda like your granddad.

42:44.557 --> 42:46.354
All action and no words.

42:56.368 --> 42:57.426
Now you got me.

42:59.905 --> 43:01.463
Time for me to do the heavy lifting.

43:02.374 --> 43:03.739
I gotta put in my hours.

43:15.054 --> 43:16.453
And I'm on the clock.

43:23.295 --> 43:26.924
There's been some huge health concerns
with poisonous snakes out there, fire ants

43:27.199 --> 43:29.759
and mosquitos infecting the city.
Have you heard much

43:30.336 --> 43:34.363

are about those folks whom...

43:34.840 --> 43:36.933
weren't fortunate to get out.

I want two minutes!
Please, two minutes. Come on!

Okay.

48:09.448 --> 48:10.210

Alright? I'm gonna go check.

53:52.557 --> 53:55.321
Thank you, machine. Thank you.

53:58.663 --> 53:59.789

Now, the Coast Guard has been
spending much of its time...

54:07.439 --> 54:10.408
with 17 helicopters in the area,

54:10.909 --> 54:15.403
rescuing people in and around the area,
literally pulling people off rooftops...

Okay.

We're gonna give this one more try.

56:31.850 --> 56:33.691
What am I gonna do
when I get to the roof, huh?

56:39.190 --> 56:40.885
Okay.

56:41.526 --> 56:42.390
Okay.

56:44.029 --> 56:45.053

58:11.549 --> 58:14.211
No! Come back! Come back!

58:15.186 --> 58:18.280
Goddammit! Goddammit!

58:18.390 --> 58:21.359
That was our way out.
That was our way out!

58:50.155 --> 58:52.487
Hospital already
without power or supplies,

58:52.891 --> 58:56.054
sniper fire hold up effort
to evacuate patients.

58:56.327 --> 58:59.888
Another hospital official said
a gunman tried to take a nurse hostage...

59:00.065 --> 59:01.930
demanding a seat on a helicopter...

59:20.085 --> 59:20.949
Hello?

01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:01.550
Where you at?

Oh, I got you.

01:00:13.972 --> 01:00:15.564
You may as well just come out.

01:00:26.484 --> 01:00:27.416
What the...?

01:00:30.388 --> 01:00:31.047
Hey!

01:00:31.856 --> 01:00:32.948
Hey, buddy.

01:00:35.126 --> 01:00:36.247
What are you doing in there?

01:00:37.529 --> 01:00:38.496
You okay?

01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:43.595
Are you tangled up there?

01:00:47.906 --> 01:00:49.464
Oh, you're tangled up, huh?

01:00:52.043 --> 01:00:54.443
Just take it easy. Stay.

01:00:56.548 --> 01:00:57.776
Well...

01:01:00.585 --> 01:01:01.552
Damnit!

I'll be right back.

01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:30.240
Son of a bitch.

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:42.923
Well, what do you say?

01:01:46.664 --> 01:01:47.688
Easy.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.398
Okay?

01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:59.042
Oh, come on. You don't wanna bite
the hand that frees you.

01:02:00.311 --> 01:02:03.212
Alright? Now be a good dog.
We're gonna do this.

01:02:06.484 --> 01:02:07.815
Let's get this.

01:02:10.922 --> 01:02:12.321
Don't you bite me.

01:02:13.391 --> 01:02:14.449
Big ass teeth.

01:02:14.993 --> 01:02:17.325
Don't bite it. That's okay.

01:02:18.396 --> 01:02:22.355
Come on. I know.
I know, I know, I know, I know. Hold on.

01:02:22.867 --> 01:02:25.529
It's okay. Easy. I'm getting this off.

01:02:29.707 --> 01:02:30.731
Alright.

01:02:32.677 --> 01:02:33.507
Good job.

01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:38.713
Good boy.

01:02:56.768 --> 01:02:59.828
Hang in there, Abby. Okay?

01:03:19.223 --> 01:03:20.053
Hey.

01:03:21.993 --> 01:03:23.633
What are you doing out there in the hall?

01:03:26.064 --> 01:03:29.830
Don't be a stranger. It's okay.
Come on. Come say hey.

01:03:32.804 --> 01:03:33.634
Come on.

01:03:36.007 --> 01:03:37.565
Don't be scared, you, big chicken.

01:03:41.112 --> 01:03:43.910
Okay. I know what you want.

01:03:59.864 --> 01:04:01.229
There you go.

01:04:03.868 --> 01:04:04.960
Go ahead.

01:04:08.673 --> 01:04:09.640
There you go.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.178
That's what I thought.

01:04:18.883 --> 01:04:20.441
So, pooch, you have a name? Hm?

01:04:22.353 --> 01:04:23.149
Shadow?

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:26.379
Spot?

01:04:27.992 --> 01:04:29.323
Or Storm?

01:04:30.828 --> 01:04:35.561
Storm. Kind of fit it right now.
Storm, it's good.

01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:39.060
Work with me, man,
these, these are cool names.

01:04:40.772 --> 01:04:43.570
Brutus. You gotta like Brutus.

01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:47.110
That's like a compliment.

01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:55.418
It's gonna take a while, obviously.
You might as well take a nap.

01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:05.048
Clearly you're smarter than I thought,

01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:08.728
Sherlock. You like Sherlock?

01:05:11.669 --> 01:05:12.761
Sherlock.

01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:15.399
It's kind of cool.

01:05:17.108 --> 01:05:18.769
Well, it's settled, then.
You're Sherlock.

01:05:25.149 --> 01:05:28.516
Oh, but you got a tag.
Let's see what your real name is.

01:05:34.025 --> 01:05:35.322
Rescue dog, huh?

01:05:40.865 --> 01:05:42.196
Hope you're embarrassed.

01:05:48.005 --> 01:05:49.233
Pretty amazing, huh?

01:05:50.408 --> 01:05:52.376
Yeah? What do you think of this?

01:05:54.078 --> 01:05:56.672
Gets old in about two seconds.
Trust me.

01:06:06.891 --> 01:06:08.381
Baby, come on. We gotta go.

01:06:09.894 --> 01:06:11.759
It's this earring is not cooperating.

01:06:13.764 --> 01:06:15.288
Yeah, we're gonna be late.

01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:28.571
How do I look?

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.452
Holy hell!

01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:38.220
What?

01:06:45.296 --> 01:06:47.093
Okay. Okay.

01:06:48.065 --> 01:06:50.090
We don't have time for this.

01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:51.934
We don't have time? Hmm?

01:06:54.272 --> 01:06:58.368
You'll get us late!
Ah! You spoiled my makeup. Nolan!

01:07:04.415 --> 01:07:06.906
- That's our reservation.
- No, it's not.

01:07:07.385 --> 01:07:09.444
Yeah. I should pick that up.
Can, can you please...?

01:07:17.929 --> 01:07:20.955
That did not feel like married sex at all.

01:07:21.432 --> 01:07:25.425
Yeah. Yeah, we should get dressed
before my wife gets back.

01:07:29.574 --> 01:07:30.563
What? What did...

01:07:44.188 --> 01:07:46.088
That was the start of you.

01:08:00.571 --> 01:08:01.629
Okay.

01:08:02.473 --> 01:08:03.531
Back at it.

01:08:08.446 --> 01:08:11.415
See? I told you this was exciting.

01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:16.109
What do you want now?

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:21.520
Oh. Okay, Mister Machine.

01:08:24.194 --> 01:08:27.528
Okay. Okay.

01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:39.469
It this the last one?

01:08:44.247 --> 01:08:45.305
Okay.

01:08:48.653 --> 01:08:49.881
Last one.

01:08:53.491 --> 01:08:54.856
You hanging in there, Abby?

01:09:02.433 --> 01:09:03.421
That looks good.

01:09:08.005 --> 01:09:09.063
Okay. Good.

01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:13.567
I wanted this.

01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:15.270
Okay, good.

01:09:16.314 --> 01:09:17.372
This is for you.

01:09:18.515 --> 01:09:19.676
You play fetch?

01:09:22.353 --> 01:09:26.255
You play fetch?
Oh, yeah. You play fetch.

01:09:33.596 --> 01:09:34.621
Let me see what you got.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:39.368
Let it go.
No, this isn't tug of war.

01:09:40.438 --> 01:09:43.737
Okay. Let me give you
a better throw. Okay?

01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:46.072
Down the hall.,
Come on, Let's go.

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:47.968
Yeah, buddy.
Come on. Down the hall.

01:09:48.312 --> 01:09:51.008
Down the hall. Down the hall.
All the way down the hall.

01:09:55.886 --> 01:09:56.910
Alright, Abby.

01:09:58.522 --> 01:10:00.547
Let's see how crafty Daddy can be here.

01:10:08.532 --> 01:10:09.692
Okay.

01:10:11.235 --> 01:10:15.365
Okay. This should work.

01:10:16.273 --> 01:10:17.638
Let's just try it like that.

01:10:18.476 --> 01:10:19.966
Stretch it tight.

01:10:24.515 --> 01:10:25.379
Thank you.

01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:29.343
No. That's mine.
I gotta focus on this right now.

01:10:30.187 --> 01:10:32.712
But you can watch. Watch this.

01:10:36.127 --> 01:10:37.492
What am I still doing here?

01:10:38.028 --> 01:10:39.086
Where's that dog going?

01:10:39.397 --> 01:10:43.356
Hey, brilliant,
I got your saline bag right here.

01:10:59.483 --> 01:11:00.541
Sherlock?

01:11:04.054 --> 01:11:05.146
Sherlock?

01:11:20.905 --> 01:11:22.270
Oh! Thank you, God.

01:11:23.073 --> 01:11:24.563
Thank you so much for coming.

01:11:27.445 --> 01:11:28.969
What are you doing in here?

01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:33.041
I'm just doing anything
I can to keep my baby alive.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.615
You been in here since power went out?

01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:39.520
Yeah. I can't leave.

01:11:39.824 --> 01:11:42.520
You know, I gotta keep this thing going.

01:11:44.228 --> 01:11:45.957
I've been stuck here without power.

01:11:48.432 --> 01:11:50.923
Looks like you already scavenged
this place real good.

01:11:56.106 --> 01:11:57.232
Yeah.

01:12:00.611 --> 01:12:03.478
Hey. What's going on out there?

01:12:03.914 --> 01:12:05.575
What's going on with the power?

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:07.550
The whole city's out, man.

01:12:08.385 --> 01:12:11.252
Quarter mile of power lines over
on 17th, just gone.

01:12:12.156 --> 01:12:14.124
They gonna have to lay new wire first.

01:12:14.825 --> 01:12:16.850
What about the relief groups?
What about the...

01:12:17.394 --> 01:12:19.419
What about the Red Cross and FEMA,

01:12:20.564 --> 01:12:21.690
and those guys?

01:12:25.336 --> 01:12:26.394
Who are you with?

01:12:27.404 --> 01:12:30.339
Whoever, man.
You got any food?

01:12:37.414 --> 01:12:38.472
What?

01:12:38.849 --> 01:12:41.647
I'm gonna take these, man.
You can keep the rest.

01:12:42.386 --> 01:12:44.445
No, don't you do this to me.
Look at this.

01:12:44.555 --> 01:12:47.251
Look at my situation, man.
Look at the baby here.

01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:50.119
Don't you go and start taking my food.
This, I need help.

01:12:50.494 --> 01:12:51.461
It's not my problem.

01:12:51.929 --> 01:12:53.191
Just go get me some help.

01:12:53.531 --> 01:12:55.565
There ain't nobody out there
gonna help you, man.

01:12:55.566 --> 01:12:58.330
I'm being real nice
lettin' you keep all the Cokes.

01:13:00.004 --> 01:13:02.802
Look, alright? I just need help.

01:13:03.407 --> 01:13:06.899
I'm gonna give you my watch, okay? Here, take this.
I want you to take my watch.

01:13:07.444 --> 01:13:08.809
I'm gonna give you some money.

01:13:10.314 --> 01:13:12.942
- Come one.
- What am I gonna do with a watch, man?

01:13:19.256 --> 01:13:21.053
I'm desperate. Okay?

01:13:21.392 --> 01:13:23.758
That's what I have.
I'm desperate here, okay?

01:13:23.928 --> 01:13:27.329
So I'm pleading with you as a stranger.
Look at my situation, man.

01:13:27.398 --> 01:13:31.926
I just want you to go out there
and just tell somebody about me.

01:13:32.236 --> 01:13:34.568
Tell them what's going on. That's free.
That doesn't cost you anything.

01:13:35.005 --> 01:13:36.472
- Just...
- All the other people out there now,

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.335
you don't want them to know about you.

01:13:38.475 --> 01:13:39.874
They're a lot worse than me.

01:13:40.678 --> 01:13:42.373
Folks raiding all the pharmacies.

01:13:43.447 --> 01:13:46.007
Can't go ten minutes
without hearing another gunshot.

01:13:47.184 --> 01:13:48.549
Now you stay real quiet here.

01:13:49.486 --> 01:13:52.250
But, listen, I don't know
what somebody else's going to want!

01:13:52.456 --> 01:13:53.787
I'll put you down, man!

01:13:55.025 --> 01:13:56.049
Okay.

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:04.528
- Call off your dog, man.
- Easy.

01:14:06.503 --> 01:14:09.199
- Call off your dog!
- No, Sherlock, don't.

01:14:10.374 --> 01:14:11.398
Relax.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.676
Okay.

01:14:30.694 --> 01:14:31.661
Sherlock!

01:14:33.664 --> 01:14:34.926
Hey, Sherlock!

01:14:36.033 --> 01:14:36.965
Get off me!

01:14:51.115 --> 01:14:55.711
Hey! Drop the bag!
The dog just wants the I.V. bags!

01:15:01.325 --> 01:15:03.122
Why the hell does he have these?

01:15:29.486 --> 01:15:31.750
You were gonna bring these to me.

01:15:36.393 --> 01:15:38.054
You bastard!

01:15:39.129 --> 01:15:42.587
She was a nurse! She was a nurse!

01:16:34.918 --> 01:16:37.011
I don't even question why I do it.

01:16:38.589 --> 01:16:39.681
I just do it.

01:16:42.826 --> 01:16:44.760
I keep cranking this thing,

01:16:46.363 --> 01:16:47.955
then I check on the baby.

01:16:53.437 --> 01:16:57.533
I'm gonna crank until my arms fall off
or I'll die trying.

01:17:00.444 --> 01:17:01.433
I know.

01:17:05.883 --> 01:17:07.612
You're so stubborn.

01:17:09.553 --> 01:17:11.612
I love that about you.

01:17:17.027 --> 01:17:19.495
- I don't get it.
- Get what, baby?

01:17:20.531 --> 01:17:24.228
This. Why this?

01:17:26.403 --> 01:17:28.530
This wasn't supposed to happen.

01:17:29.473 --> 01:17:30.633
I know.

01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:37.203
But sometimes you
just have to hold onto whatever you can.

01:17:40.284 --> 01:17:45.483
I won't be a good father.
Not like I was a husband.

01:17:46.256 --> 01:17:47.382
Yes, you will.

01:17:51.428 --> 01:17:54.226
Do you remember Marc's birthday party?

01:17:55.666 --> 01:17:56.633
Yeah.

01:17:57.167 --> 01:17:59.567
We were all loitering
in the parking lot, and...

01:18:00.204 --> 01:18:02.968
the plan was to go
to the dive bar next door,

01:18:03.473 --> 01:18:04.963
keep the party going.

01:18:07.444 --> 01:18:10.607
But you said that we couldn't make it
because I had to work the next day

01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:12.508
and you had to get me to bed.

01:18:13.951 --> 01:18:17.512
- Yeah, and you were pissed.
- Oh, yeah.

01:18:23.327 --> 01:18:25.090
But secretly...

01:18:25.996 --> 01:18:27.486
I loved that.

01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:33.596
Because I knew right then and there,

01:18:35.606 --> 01:18:38.040
you'd be an amazing father.

01:18:47.885 --> 01:18:51.218
But, I need you. You know?

01:18:54.524 --> 01:18:56.321
I don't wanna do this without you.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.124
You have me.

01:19:05.969 --> 01:19:07.368
You always will.

01:19:15.545 --> 01:19:17.672
She is you and me together.

01:19:21.652 --> 01:19:23.449
You're not alone, Nolan.

01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:29.358
Abigail.

01:19:31.895 --> 01:19:33.419
She's listening.

01:19:35.632 --> 01:19:37.930
She recognizes your voice.

01:19:52.683 --> 01:19:53.809
Abigail...

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.485
I'm so tired.

01:20:05.762 --> 01:20:07.320
I'm just tired.

01:20:07.464 --> 01:20:10.490
If they don't have a radio
they're not exactly sure what's going on.

01:20:10.567 --> 01:20:13.764
We actually had one gentleman giving
us some sort of Morse Code...

01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:16.539
with his flashlight this morning
in the early darkness,

01:20:16.873 --> 01:20:18.431
trying to signal to us...

01:21:41.191 --> 01:21:42.658
Sixteen...

01:21:45.295 --> 01:21:46.489
seventeen...

01:22:14.391 --> 01:22:15.358
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:22:42.919 --> 01:22:44.045
Yeah.

01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:50.587
Yeah, and soon you're gonna be
breathing on your own.

01:22:51.194 --> 01:22:53.958
Baby, almost.

01:22:55.265 --> 01:22:56.357
Just a little longer.

01:22:57.968 --> 01:23:02.564
Doctor said 48 hours,
so that should be pretty soon.

01:23:04.007 --> 01:23:07.875
Just hang on a little bit longer.
Okay?

01:23:09.246 --> 01:23:10.838
And then we'll go home.

01:23:17.721 --> 01:23:18.881
Oh, yeah.

01:23:23.426 --> 01:23:24.723
Yeah, that's good.

01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:30.233
Yeah. I'm getting you home.

01:23:31.768 --> 01:23:33.599
I should have done this yesterday.

01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:57.078
- Nothing's gonna be here, man.
- You don't know that.

01:23:57.394 --> 01:23:58.834
- Yeah. Look at this place.
- I know.

01:23:58.895 --> 01:23:59.589
It's been gutted.

01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:02.030
Lenny said it was
just one dude guarding it.

01:24:07.771 --> 01:24:09.612
Take... I'm gonna take
another one of you guys.

01:24:14.711 --> 01:24:16.372
Okay, if I just take one...

01:24:30.894 --> 01:24:31.918
Hello?

01:24:35.465 --> 01:24:36.489
Hello?

01:24:39.836 --> 01:24:40.796
What the hell you doing?

01:24:41.271 --> 01:24:44.536
If dude is still here, might as well call him
out now so I can pop him and be done with it.

01:24:44.841 --> 01:24:48.038
So, the cops are gone and all of a sudden
you wanna shoot everybody.

01:24:51.047 --> 01:24:52.275
Well, yeah.

01:25:02.158 --> 01:25:03.716
Holy shit!

01:25:04.494 --> 01:25:05.392
What?

01:25:05.729 --> 01:25:07.720
Them fools left the pharmacy open.

01:25:16.439 --> 01:25:18.532
Oh, I'm getting so high tonight.

01:25:22.512 --> 01:25:24.713
You, dumb-ass. You know what's better
than getting high?

01:25:25.215 --> 01:25:26.113
Getting rich.

01:25:26.449 --> 01:25:28.713
Spoken like someone
who never been high.

01:25:29.152 --> 01:25:33.020
Get all the hydrocodone
on the top shelf, grab it all!

01:25:42.232 --> 01:25:43.494
You hear that?

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.588
Lobo, hold up.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.275
Jase! What is it?

01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:34.878
Goddamn, man!

01:26:37.053 --> 01:26:38.418
What the fuck?

01:26:44.394 --> 01:26:45.486
A baby?

01:26:48.031 --> 01:26:49.191
Hey, yo, Lobo,

01:26:51.067 --> 01:26:52.159
it's a bab...

01:27:09.686 --> 01:27:10.744
Fuck.

01:27:35.011 --> 01:27:36.308
It's okay, baby.

01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:41.014
It's okay, baby.

01:27:44.487 --> 01:27:47.923
Yeah. Daddy's got you.

01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:55.592
Daddy's got you.

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:54.648
Shit!

01:30:08.565 --> 01:30:09.532
Here.

01:31:02.552 --> 01:31:03.484
Can you hear me?

01:31:11.094 --> 01:31:12.789
One, two.

01:31:15.798 --> 01:31:16.822
Let's go.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.372
Abby...

01:31:27.543 --> 01:31:28.510
Abby...

01:31:29.512 --> 01:31:30.638
Save the strength, sir.

01:31:32.315 --> 01:31:34.442
- Abigail. Abby...
- Hey.

01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:36.852
You got a smart dog there,
you know that?

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.680
Abby...

01:31:39.555 --> 01:31:40.783
My baby...

01:31:42.525 --> 01:31:43.389
My baby...

01:31:46.029 --> 01:31:46.654
What?

01:31:47.196 --> 01:31:48.823
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:31:49.332 --> 01:31:50.162
That's a baby.

01:31:51.134 --> 01:31:52.931
- It's a baby?
- That, that's a baby.

01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:03.378
Holy moly! It's a baby!

01:32:04.447 --> 01:32:06.881
- My God! Is it yours?
- Yeah.

01:32:07.383 --> 01:32:07.940
Yeah.

01:32:08.384 --> 01:32:09.351
Yeah.

01:32:09.952 --> 01:32:10.816
Yeah.

01:32:22.131 --> 01:32:25.328
I know you, baby.
I know you.
