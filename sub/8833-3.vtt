WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.166
Death to the Medicis!

00:02.836 --> 00:04.336
I must return to the palace.

00:04.404 --> 00:09.575
Citizens of Florence, I put
the fate of our Republic

00:09.642 --> 00:11.510
in your hands.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.013
Palle!
The Medici rallying cry.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.681
We apprehend
the Pazzi traitors.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.282
<i>You dare kill a cardinal?</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:20.252
We will dangle you
in your Sunday best.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.521
You let Riario take Nico?

00:22.589 --> 00:24.456
I was supposed
to be on that ship.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.724
There's someone
that can help.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.193
There is a man
named Vespucci.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.696
You wish to sail west
but the Vatican have stolen your ship.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.765
We steal one of theirs.

00:32.832 --> 00:36.168
You seek an alliance with us
against France?

00:36.236 --> 00:37.436
How may we be of service?

00:37.504 --> 00:39.171
Rome's aggression
will not stop.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.672
Did this belong
to your grandfather?

00:40.740 --> 00:42.207
Take it with you
on your journey.

00:42.275 --> 00:45.477

Do you know,
who I am?

02:15.902 --> 02:18.470
Indeed, Count Riario.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.707
The name of the Pope's
nephew is well known.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.343
Well, then, you know
the consequences

02:24.410 --> 02:28.814
if you do not cede
this ship to me.

02:28.881 --> 02:33.251
Alfonso, Duke of Calabria,
governs this vessel.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.421
We carry slaves to Genoa
for his father -

02:36.489 --> 02:39.324
King Ferrante.

02:39.392 --> 02:44.730
If you do not give up
this ship to my command,

02:44.797 --> 02:50.302
in days there shall be
no one left...in Italy

02:50.370 --> 02:53.805
named Sindona.

02:53.873 --> 02:58.810
Your wife,
children, cousins,

02:58.878 --> 03:00.712
I shall visit them all.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.320
I suppose if I set sail
immediately,

03:08.388 --> 03:11.723
then I won't have to
explain to Duke Alfonso...

03:11.791 --> 03:13.925
A wise decision indeed.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.328
Explain what,
Captain?

03:19.265 --> 03:21.433
Count Riario acts
for Pope Sixtus,

03:21.501 --> 03:23.835
who wishes to commandeer
the Sentinel

03:23.903 --> 03:26.304
for a new destination.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.306
Does he now?

03:28.374 --> 03:32.577
Perhaps you did not realize,
I know Riario well.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.480
The Count is
a friend of mine.

03:35.548 --> 03:40.152
While you,
senor, well...

03:40.219 --> 03:42.621
Need I elaborate?
You said this would work.

03:42.688 --> 03:46.358
It would have done if Firello
fucking Two Blades hadn't shown up.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.660
Who masquerades
before Alfonso,

03:48.728 --> 03:53.698
warrior par excellence
and heir of the Kingdom of Naples?

03:53.766 --> 03:56.168
Leonardo.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.503
Sorry,
I'm still in character.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.474
I'm Leonardo Da Vinci. Revolutionary
painter, artist and visionary,

04:02.542 --> 04:04.376
of the Republic of Florence.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.446
Arrogant bastard,
aren't you?

04:07.513 --> 04:11.249
Bastard, yes. But it's hardly
arrogance to speak the truth.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.352
I am the son of a king,
anointed by God.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.824
While you, I gather,
are legally the son of no one.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.358
Not bad.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.788
I was about to say
the same of you.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.598
Well, now you're
just showing off.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.200
Let's get out of here.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.534
Time to swim.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.339
Leo?

04:35.875 --> 04:36.942
Aargh!

04:41.914 --> 04:43.248
Fine.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.721
I am an artist too,
but I paint with steel.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.657
Death by sea or sword?

04:52.725 --> 04:55.694
Either a fitting end
for a bastard.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.581
While restoring the Aqueduct,

05:16.649 --> 05:18.750
I shall rebuild
some 30 churches.

05:18.818 --> 05:23.255
San Vitale, Santa Maria
del Popolo, St Peter's.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.757
I shall commission a new chapel:
frescos on the ceiling.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.326
Your Holiness?

05:28.394 --> 05:30.629
He carries bad news.

05:31.898 --> 05:35.500
Lorenzo de Medici
rules Florence once again.

05:35.568 --> 05:39.237
<i>Jacopo Pazzi has been</i>
<i>murdered by the mob.</i>

05:39.305 --> 05:43.241
Francesco Pazzi
and Cardinal Orsini

05:43.309 --> 05:44.809
have been hanged.

05:44.877 --> 05:50.248
The Cardinal, decaying in his
full ecclesiastical robes.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.887
At last, someone brings me
good tidings from Florence.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.525
How so, Your Holiness?
Lorenzo's sinful Republic

06:00.593 --> 06:02.861
courts heresy at every turn.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.163
The artists
flocking to his city

06:05.231 --> 06:08.700
would find God and truth
on their own.

06:08.768 --> 06:12.070
As if sheep don't need
a shepherd guiding them.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.573
Their manic celebration
of free thinking

06:14.640 --> 06:18.076
has led them to overreach.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.712
Fatally so.

06:20.780 --> 06:25.216
Now they would hang
one of God's own?

06:25.284 --> 06:30.055
Well, such an act
justifies any retaliation

06:30.122 --> 06:32.090
I might consider.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.261
Hm...

06:36.329 --> 06:38.430
Mark this, sirs.

06:38.497 --> 06:41.299
Today,
the Republic of Florence

06:41.367 --> 06:45.437
and every man, woman
and misbegotten child therein

06:45.504 --> 06:49.040
are...ex-communicated.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.244
Let them wallow
in unholy squalor.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.680
Damned in this world
and the next.

06:55.748 --> 06:59.417
The death bell tolls
for Florence.

07:12.898 --> 07:15.100
Jacopo Pazzi's home.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.768
He wants to take a bath!

07:16.836 --> 07:18.503
Let's throw him in the river!

07:39.892 --> 07:43.428
I suppose it's proof
of our fallen nature.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.630
We can't help but to look.

07:46.565 --> 07:49.334
They were monsters.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.569
If you ask me you were
justified in hanging them.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.805
I didn't ask.

07:53.873 --> 07:57.175
You must find someplace
where you can avoid all this.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.843
Such sights
will endanger the child.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.478
I don't believe that.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.085
Neither did I.

08:08.521 --> 08:13.258
I think I should decide
what's best for my child.

08:13.325 --> 08:17.495
I am capable of that...
all on my own.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.401
I don't believe that.

08:31.043 --> 08:34.813
I wasn't anticipating another
ambidextrous swordsman in Italy.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.515
When the barons of Salerno
schemed against Naples,

08:37.582 --> 08:40.652
Alfonso's forces crushed the insurrection.
He lives for battle.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.456
It's hard facing someone who's better
at what he does than you. It's tough.

08:44.523 --> 08:46.391
Is there any other ship
we can accost?

08:46.459 --> 08:49.728
One that will withstand the rigors
of a voyage across the Atlantic?

08:49.795 --> 08:51.162
I know every ship in Pisa.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.131
The Sentinel's
your only recourse.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.133
Then I have to be
on that ship.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.372
<i>Is this quest of yours</i>
<i>worth all the risk?</i>

09:01.440 --> 09:03.875
We can make money in Genoa,
in Savoy, even here in Pisa.

09:03.943 --> 09:06.945
People know Alfonso's assessing
the city for a possible invasion.

09:07.012 --> 09:08.947
And scared people
are easy to fleece.

09:09.014 --> 09:11.549
If you could put aside your
rapacious greed for a moment,

09:11.617 --> 09:13.618
you clot-pole,
we have a friend to rescue.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.820
There's more than
Nico's life at stake.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.022
There are hundreds
of painters in Florence.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.492
And you pair up with the one
who's out to save the world.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.460
If you want our Medici credit
vouchers you'll help us.

09:22.528 --> 09:24.028
I'm always
interested in money,

09:24.096 --> 09:25.897
but your only hope is
the Sentinel.

09:25.965 --> 09:29.067
After our last escape, rowing out there
would provide them with easy targets.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.970
We'd be killed and chopped up
to feed their slaves.

09:34.106 --> 09:36.174
If we could reach
the ship safely,

09:36.242 --> 09:38.042
we could free
those slaves.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.578
They deserve to have
their chains sundered.

09:40.646 --> 09:44.516
And the chaos of slave rebellion
would help us seize command.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.417
Pity we didn't bring
your underwater it.

09:46.485 --> 09:47.645
It wouldn't withstand
the sea.

09:47.686 --> 09:49.487
You made an
underwater suit?

09:49.555 --> 09:50.989
Then the Turk's right.
Your quest is over.

09:51.056 --> 09:52.590
Riario gets the book,
Nico's dead.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.795
Leo, where are you going?

09:56.862 --> 09:59.497
To solve this problem somehow.

09:59.565 --> 10:03.401
I may not be able to best Alfonso man
to man - that doesn't mean I can't win.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.605
Our Republic
is ex-communicated.

10:07.673 --> 10:11.409
We are dammed to a man,
to a woman, to a child.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.945
Sixtus would do
such a thing?

10:14.013 --> 10:16.481
Who is that murderer to
tell us we're not Christians?

10:16.549 --> 10:17.949
Did you expect
no retaliation

10:18.017 --> 10:19.717
when you had
your brother strung up?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.019
Would you for
a moment suggest

10:21.086 --> 10:23.755
that we let any
of Giuliano's killers live?

10:23.823 --> 10:26.357
All of Florence
applauds this justice.

10:26.425 --> 10:27.826
Until they starve.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.597
This declaration is the
equivalent of a trade embargo.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.966
No Christian is allowed
to do business with us.

10:35.034 --> 10:38.603
<i>With King Ferrante, Duke Federico
and Sixtus all against us,</i>

10:38.671 --> 10:40.638
Milan will hesitate
to take our side,

10:40.706 --> 10:42.440
and nor will Spain
come to our aid -

10:42.508 --> 10:44.375
too busy with
their foul Inquisition.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.678
Ferrante will strike
here in Pisa,

10:46.745 --> 10:49.013
and continuing through
Lucca and on to Savoy,

10:49.081 --> 10:52.317
gaining strength to make
a move against Venice.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.452
The peninsula could be
theirs within a year.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.287
With terrifying ease.

10:56.355 --> 10:59.858
Florence creates
the future.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.628
But not if we fall prey
to this infernal alliance.

11:03.696 --> 11:07.665
Rome will control
all faith and knowledge.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.174
Let's just wrap that up.

11:28.454 --> 11:30.955
I will not allow
the Turk to be right.

11:32.524 --> 11:34.792
There is a way to follow Riario
and Nico, there must be.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.694
What the hell is that?

11:36.762 --> 11:37.942
With the right balance,

11:37.967 --> 11:40.168
a man might use fitted pontoons
to walk on water. But...

11:41.734 --> 11:44.602
Alfonso and his men would just
shoot him down on sight.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.939
We could ram the ship
with this.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.674
But then it would sink
uselessly.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.244
Well, no strapping me
into a fucking catapult.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.580
Damn it, Da Vinci,
look here.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.148
Duke Alfonso
has put a price

11:57.216 --> 11:58.983
on that fevered skull
of yours.

12:02.421 --> 12:05.823
This is an appalling likeness.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.660
If only you were a sorcerer,
we'd have the ship by now.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.896
How can the Duke even offer a reward?
He holds no authority in Pisa.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.065
All he needs
is one hungry man

12:14.133 --> 12:16.000
in a scared city
to turn Da Vinci in.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.569
I admit,
I'm impressed by 20 florins.

12:18.637 --> 12:21.639
It's an attractive sum.

12:21.707 --> 12:26.477
Put this one up. People shouldn't
have to suffer pedestrian artwork.

12:28.113 --> 12:32.984
<i>Shellfish!</i>
<i>Shellfish, nice and fresh!</i>

12:33.052 --> 12:35.086
<i>Get your fresh...</i>

12:45.097 --> 12:46.698
It smells like
a cheap whore.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.967
Ah! Brings back
memories, eh?

12:49.034 --> 12:52.236
Remember that ripe little
brothel back in Peretola?

12:52.304 --> 12:54.739
Or have you switched
from fish to meat?

12:54.807 --> 12:57.575
I don't know. Does your
mother qualify as meat?

12:57.643 --> 12:59.911
Trout two florins.
Two florins for trout.

12:59.979 --> 13:03.247
You can't really expect such
a price for trout, can you?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.817
The Pope's damned us to hell,
cut us off from the world.

13:05.884 --> 13:08.553
It will be harder
to buy anything hereon.

13:10.689 --> 13:12.857
Tentacles...

13:12.925 --> 13:16.728
The way this creature attaches
itself to its quarry.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.429
Sort of like a leech.

13:18.497 --> 13:21.432
Greedy, sheep-sucking sponge!

13:21.500 --> 13:23.801
I make money through
connections, Zoroaster.

13:23.869 --> 13:27.805
As would you if you
were more successful.

13:27.873 --> 13:31.743
This shell provides
solid protection.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.878
But moves too slowly.

13:39.618 --> 13:43.588
Oh, shit. He's making
the connection himself.

13:43.655 --> 13:47.392
Hey, you, with the face.
Do I know you?

13:47.459 --> 13:50.194
That scampi you sold me had my
wife being sick for a week.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.262
Yes, I think you know me.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.769
My bride couldn't even shag
me on Midsummer Eve,

13:57.836 --> 13:59.504
this scutmonger
made her so sick.

13:59.571 --> 14:01.839
Is that right?
Is that right?

14:01.907 --> 14:05.143
<i>Mind your backs.</i>
<i>Coming through!</i>

14:05.210 --> 14:07.245
<i>Get out of the way, dear.</i>

14:07.312 --> 14:09.514
<i>Don't want to do you</i>
<i>an injury now.</i>

14:09.581 --> 14:11.182
<i>Mind your backs.</i>
<i>Coming through.</i>

14:13.318 --> 14:14.986
It's all right. Vespucci.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.357
We need to go.
This creature solves it.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.159
Marvelous. We have to go.
Yep...

14:24.363 --> 14:28.032
How could you have executed
Cardinal Orsini?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.401
<i>Our trade and banking partners</i>
<i>are deserting us</i>

14:30.469 --> 14:33.337
<i>as they hear of Florence's</i>
<i>ex-communication.</i>

14:33.405 --> 14:37.408
Surely you knew such action would
bring God's wrath upon our city.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.410
Disavow her, Lorenzo,
to help us...

14:39.478 --> 14:43.781
If anyone deserves God's anger,
is it not Cardinal Orsini?

14:45.918 --> 14:49.220
Who befouled Easter Sunday, the
most holy day of the year?

14:49.288 --> 14:50.588
<i>Who plotted with traitors</i>

14:50.656 --> 14:53.458
<i>to bring death into</i>
<i>our sacred cathedral?</i>

14:54.693 --> 14:56.627
Clarice carried out
my exact wishes.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.362
Then both of you
can take credit

14:58.430 --> 15:00.631
as our city
slowly starves.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.934
Panic is an ugly thing,
gentlemen.

15:03.001 --> 15:05.603
It makes people overreach.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.406
Your Grace, people begin
to flee our Republic

15:08.474 --> 15:10.808
seeking haven
from ex-communication.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.910
The ranks of my own
officers are thinning.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.179
We cannot guarantee
order.

15:15.247 --> 15:20.017
The Medici Bank will founder unless if
we cannot atone for Orsini's death.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.788
Then the head of the Medici Bank
shall take action.

15:26.525 --> 15:31.129
Surely I can reason
any antagonist to my side.

15:31.196 --> 15:34.632
Just as I tamed the mobs
that ran amok in our city.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.168
Neither the Pope
or King Ferrante

15:37.236 --> 15:40.271
will receive any diplomatic
envoy from Florence.

15:40.339 --> 15:41.706
They will receive me.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.346
They will not hide and delay given
the chance to speak to my face.

15:48.413 --> 15:50.515
If you can only reach Naples.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.552
You and I shall ride
there undercover.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.487
Slip through Siena
and the Papal States

15:56.555 --> 15:58.756
and confront King Ferrante
and his court directly.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.192
You and I?

16:03.028 --> 16:05.863
Your legal counsel
will be invaluable.

16:05.931 --> 16:09.167
And I know most of the
Neapolitan court from my youth.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.569
They will attend
my arguments.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.405
<i>And I will persuade Ferrante</i>
<i>that no alliance with Sixtus</i>

16:14.473 --> 16:17.341
ever benefits
the Pope's partners.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.443
My love, perhaps you
haven't yet recovered...

16:19.511 --> 16:22.947
Being the one most hated and
persecuted by our enemies,

16:23.015 --> 16:26.851
I may...by placing myself
in their hands,

16:26.919 --> 16:31.055
be the means of restoring
peace to our city.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.891
I am more bound
than other any man here

16:33.959 --> 16:38.362
to give up all to my country.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.032
Even my life.

16:41.099 --> 16:44.502
But with no Medici authority
among the Signoria,

16:44.570 --> 16:47.872
will we be able to defend
the city in your absence?

16:47.940 --> 16:51.075
Clarice shall supply
that authority.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.045
I trust her to act
on my behalf.

16:54.112 --> 16:56.180
Obey her as you would me.

16:56.248 --> 16:59.250
A woman?
You cannot be serious.

16:59.318 --> 17:03.120
Each word you speak against my
wife invites more retribution...

17:06.625 --> 17:11.262
I will save our city...

17:11.329 --> 17:15.066
..returning to hear
how you supported Clarice.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.137
Or I will feed you your
fat fingers one by one.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.976
Am I understood?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.153
Florence awaits
our success.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.764
<i>Make way for His Eminence.</i>

18:27.306 --> 18:28.939
<i>Make way for His Eminence.</i>

18:38.450 --> 18:42.586
Oh! God's wounds!
Walk steadily!

19:02.607 --> 19:04.742
Good morning, Cardinal.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.982
Just relax.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.885
If I wanted you dead then
my dear friend Quon Shan

19:14.953 --> 19:16.020
would have done
it before you knew.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.256
What do you want?
To enlighten you.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.192
As curator of
the Secret Archives,

19:21.259 --> 19:24.495
you place value on clandestine
knowledge, do you not?

19:24.563 --> 19:26.997
I have a secret I think
you might be interested in.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.433
Ha! Said Eve to Adam.

19:30.969 --> 19:34.972
Inside the Castel Sant'Angelo
the Pope holds a prisoner.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.842
A man about whom
you care deeply.

19:37.909 --> 19:42.580
How would a whore like you know
of the Pope's dealings?

19:45.884 --> 19:50.321
Don't believe me. Search every
corner of the Castel Sant'Angelo.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.490
And then when you have found
the man that I describe,

19:52.557 --> 19:56.327
you will come back here and
meet me, of your own accord.

19:56.395 --> 19:59.063
What stops me from simply
ordering guards

19:59.131 --> 20:03.434
to arrest you and your...
heathen mute?

20:06.037 --> 20:09.507
When you discover whom
the Pope holds prisoner,

20:09.574 --> 20:13.377
arresting us will be
the last thing on your mind.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.282
It's perfect. It's perfect.
It's just as I asked.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.484
Everything. Lamp oil,
grappling hooks,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.987
three dozen leather skins,
glass, scrap iron.

20:23.054 --> 20:24.822
And...from
my own collection,

20:24.890 --> 20:29.994
these maps by the cartographer
Toscanelli should prove useful.

20:30.061 --> 20:33.397
I still need a second well-balanced
sword should I face Duke Alfonso again.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.332
Of course.
I'm glad you're pleased.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.168
We spent most
of your coin on it all.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.536
I thought you said...
Sssh.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.171
What?
Didn't you spend it all?

20:40.238 --> 20:43.174
Not in front
of the laborers.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.309
They work for an advance
against future pay.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.345
They won't take too kindly to
know there is no future pay.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.848
We'll save that revelation
till after we're gone.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.417
You are... As if you've never
duped anyone like this.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.187
I dupe people
who deserve it.

20:56.254 --> 20:59.256
Anyone gullible enough
to be duped deserves it.

20:59.324 --> 21:02.359
Whatever pads one's purse
is fair game. No?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.795
Well, don't tell me you work
for Da Vinci for free.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.200
He doesn't pay you?

21:09.267 --> 21:11.302
Is he that well hung?

21:11.369 --> 21:14.171
You plibbling,
flat-mouthed pustule...

21:14.239 --> 21:18.275
Gentlemen! Your friend
is quick with insults.

21:18.343 --> 21:21.278
But he does not endure
them so well.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.982
What do you plan to make out
of all this...miscellany?

21:25.050 --> 21:28.886
It's a new invention.
A mechanical fish.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.988
Trout, salmon, cod?

21:31.056 --> 21:35.292
Part trout, part turtle,
part lamprey.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.163
Nature always produces ingenious
hybrids, so shall we.

21:39.231 --> 21:43.067
Look! You and I shall
board this craft,

21:43.134 --> 21:45.035
once I've calculated
how much air we need.

21:45.103 --> 21:47.238
We toss it into the sea, float
beneath the surface,

21:47.305 --> 21:49.039
paddling until
we reach the ship.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.275
Grappling hooks
will attach to its hull.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.911
We wait till nightfall, board
the boat, free the slaves,

21:53.979 --> 21:56.814
and in the resulting uprising,
the ship will be ours.

21:58.216 --> 21:59.984
He's not kidding.
He never kids.

22:00.051 --> 22:04.488
So you would get into a turtle
shell with him and drown there?

22:04.556 --> 22:09.159
No, we'd just smash the glass and
swim to safety if it came to that.

22:09.227 --> 22:12.463
Yes, and Alfonso's forces would
see you both hit the surface

22:12.531 --> 22:14.899
and lance you through
with arrows and spears.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.467
You agreed to help us
acquire a ship.

22:16.535 --> 22:20.304
This...is how we'll do it.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.572
I suggest you support it,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.375
seeing how your own plan
failed utterly.

22:24.442 --> 22:27.811
You must know...you're mad.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.213
I've heard it said.

22:34.352 --> 22:37.755
Lunatics think
much of themselves.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.593
I'll not be part
of your madness.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.798
Not that I mind
seeing him go,

22:47.866 --> 22:50.167
but can we afford to lose
our expert on ships

22:50.235 --> 22:51.835
and their capabilities?

22:54.572 --> 22:55.839
To work!

23:04.682 --> 23:07.718
Clearly you meant it when you said
you didn't deserve your family,

23:07.786 --> 23:09.953
for now you would
vanish on us.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.957
In the name
of protecting you.

23:14.025 --> 23:17.761
I nearly lost you to assassins
on Easter Sunday.

23:17.829 --> 23:21.398
Now you dream you can ride into
the court of our enemies

23:21.466 --> 23:23.901
without getting killed.

23:23.968 --> 23:25.936
There must be a subtler
way to negotiate.

23:26.004 --> 23:28.672
In our plight
subtlety will no longer do.

23:30.008 --> 23:33.277
Your plan for Giuliano
to marry Camilla Pazzi,

23:33.344 --> 23:37.081
that was a subtle plan
that got my brother killed.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.884
Deep down I doubted
the notion.

23:40.952 --> 23:43.754
I... should
have gone with my gut.

23:43.822 --> 23:47.191
That's what Giuliano would have
done, and from now on, I do too.

23:47.258 --> 23:49.460
You blame me
for Giuliano's death?

23:49.527 --> 23:50.861
I wasn't making
that exact point.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.564
<i>No, no,</i>
<i>you were being subtle.</i>

23:53.631 --> 23:57.234
And you're right -
fuck subtlety.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.406
Well, now, your real
feelings for me emerge.

24:02.474 --> 24:05.943
I could have obliged the
Signoria and had you thrown out.

24:06.010 --> 24:08.312
Claimed your actions
stemmed from an anger

24:08.379 --> 24:10.447
I could not quell
in my weakened state,

24:10.515 --> 24:13.450
yet...yet I defended you.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.452
A man and woman,
one in marriage.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.054
You've never
believed that.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.656
You see matrimony
as a political tool.

24:19.724 --> 24:22.960
Your grandfather
chose a safe wife from Rome

24:23.027 --> 24:25.929
as a matter
of strategy.

24:25.997 --> 24:30.567
I've tried, but you keep me
outside your heart.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.539
You'll have no luck
using that on me.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.608
No...

24:37.675 --> 24:42.279
This...is for her.

24:42.347 --> 24:44.815
No, no. Clarice, no.

24:44.883 --> 24:49.019
Now it is a masterpiece.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.991
Let's talk of your
vaunted gut instinct.

24:54.058 --> 24:58.695
The one that invited
this whore into our home.

24:58.763 --> 25:02.099
A Roman spy in our court.

25:04.469 --> 25:07.571
Lucrezia...? What...?

25:07.639 --> 25:09.573
No one dared to tell you.

25:09.641 --> 25:12.643
It falls to your
dutiful bride.

25:12.710 --> 25:15.445
Lucrezia Donati betrayed you
to Sixtus and the Pazzi.

25:15.513 --> 25:19.650
Your gut instinct is why
you no longer have a brother.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.688
Ask Dragonetti
if you don't believe me.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.790
He knows
all of Lucrezia's sins.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.859
Not that she
matters anymore.

25:28.927 --> 25:30.894
Riario likely
killed her days ago

25:30.962 --> 25:33.263
when her uses
reached an end.

25:33.331 --> 25:36.900
What she did was
intrigue and deception.

25:36.968 --> 25:39.436
What I do now
is the opposite.

25:39.504 --> 25:43.240
I'm confronting Ferrante
man to man.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.376
I will save my city.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.889
Hang on,
I'm slipping.

26:32.957 --> 26:35.759
<i>Steady.</i>
<i>Steady!</i>

26:40.798 --> 26:43.267
Hold it.

26:44.636 --> 26:45.869
From this angle,

26:45.937 --> 26:48.272
if we paddle west
by southwest for 30 minutes

26:48.339 --> 26:49.706
at 18 revolutions
per minute,

26:49.774 --> 26:53.710
we should reach the hull of the
Sentinel just before dusk.

26:53.778 --> 26:57.648
We'll wait for darkness, scale
the side of the ship...

26:57.715 --> 27:00.150
..and start a revolution.

27:03.454 --> 27:05.289
Time to make history.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.559
And you're sure
we have enough air?

27:09.627 --> 27:11.795
A man at rest breathes one
modius of air per minute.

27:11.863 --> 27:15.599
If we keep to the count, 18 revolutions
per minute, we'll be fine.

27:18.002 --> 27:20.270
Wait. If you die down there,
how do we get paid?

27:20.338 --> 27:23.674
Fish us up, and sell
the remains as salvage.

27:23.741 --> 27:25.609
Heave-ho!

27:28.546 --> 27:29.880
Got it?
Yep.

27:29.947 --> 27:32.582
You in?
Yeah.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.217
Where did you put the pisser?

27:34.285 --> 27:36.486
Tie a knot in it,
it's long enough.

27:36.554 --> 27:38.088
Right.

27:39.290 --> 27:40.957
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

27:41.025 --> 27:44.661
<i>Right, they're ready. Prepare
to cast off. Watch it!</i>

27:54.739 --> 27:56.540
This part's working.

27:56.607 --> 27:58.275
Gravity's sinking us down.
Indeed.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.210
No, we're not, we're not
springing any leaks.

28:00.278 --> 28:02.179
It means
the waterproofing's holding.

28:02.246 --> 28:07.084
When do we start paddling? Once
we stop sinking, and stabilize.

28:07.151 --> 28:09.353
Right. When is that?

28:17.929 --> 28:20.397
Oh, shit.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.871
If you wanted a vessel that sinks
to the bottom, why not ask me?

28:27.939 --> 28:29.806
One step at a time.

28:29.874 --> 28:33.643
Now we just simply
release some ballast...

28:35.646 --> 28:38.148
..until we reach
the correct depth.

28:43.821 --> 28:47.424
Damn,
this could actually work.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.626
Time to start moving.

28:49.660 --> 28:52.295
Remember, 18 revolutions
per minute.

28:52.363 --> 28:55.132
Yes? Push.

29:07.578 --> 29:09.846
Ha-ha-ha!

30:14.779 --> 30:19.549
Haven't seen
one of these in ages.

30:19.617 --> 30:21.985
Do you still play?

30:35.299 --> 30:39.269
Who are you? What have you done
to deserve your chains?

30:39.337 --> 30:42.405
It's good to see you again,
Lupo.

30:42.473 --> 30:45.542
How many years has it been?

30:45.610 --> 30:47.944
God in heaven...

30:49.547 --> 30:51.681
What are you?

30:51.749 --> 30:56.686
In your heart
you know what I am.

30:56.754 --> 31:00.724
The one true hope.

31:01.659 --> 31:02.692
Huh.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.868
Is it true what Captain Sindona
tells me?

31:11.936 --> 31:15.472
Yes. I can lead you
to Da Vinci.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.608
Weren't you with him when
he tried to steal my ship?

31:18.676 --> 31:20.410
Money is money.

31:20.478 --> 31:24.180
I've seen your bounty posters that
offer more than that lunatic can pay.

31:24.248 --> 31:26.616
You'll get the florins when
I have the knave in hand.

31:26.684 --> 31:29.686
Where is he? In a storehouse
I lease by the waterfront.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.756
Building an insane contraption he
thinks will get him to your ship.

31:32.823 --> 31:35.258
I'll take you there.

31:35.326 --> 31:40.363
Perhaps you stay here while I
send men to your storehouse.

31:40.431 --> 31:45.569
If you're lying, I eviscerate
you and pitch you over the bow.

31:46.804 --> 31:49.139
As you will.

31:51.375 --> 31:54.044
Go where he tells you.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

31:55.613 --> 31:59.916
And is it possible you never
recovered Da Vinci's dagger?

31:59.984 --> 32:01.851
The slaves refuse
to hand it over.

32:06.524 --> 32:09.559
Finding it means looking close
enough to get your throat slashed.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.595
And we don't have a man
to spare.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.833
Clever little shits,
aren't they?

32:24.542 --> 32:27.777
Adamu, Mihail...

32:27.845 --> 32:30.480
The other vassals
listen to you.

32:30.548 --> 32:34.684
Produce the weapon or the women
among you suffer.

32:34.752 --> 32:37.053
One by one until you obey.

32:43.227 --> 32:44.327
Not today.

32:45.863 --> 32:49.833
What's your name?
Yana.

32:49.900 --> 32:54.771
You are mistaken.
From now on, your name is...

32:56.807 --> 32:58.475
Toy.

33:02.813 --> 33:05.915
Free her ankles. Keep her wrists
bound and see her to my chambers.

33:05.983 --> 33:07.017
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

33:20.297 --> 33:23.900
If you are
Francesco della Rovere,

33:23.968 --> 33:26.403
who wears
the Pope's robes?

33:26.470 --> 33:28.605
I never knew you
to have a twin brother.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.807
He fled our family.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.742
When young.

33:32.810 --> 33:36.479
We were happy he left.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.381
And then one morning,

33:38.449 --> 33:41.584
after my election
to the Papacy,

33:41.652 --> 33:44.521
Alessandro...

33:44.588 --> 33:46.489
..seized me by surprise.

33:46.557 --> 33:49.726
Threw me in this cell, keeping
me alive for his own reasons.

33:49.794 --> 33:54.130
Killing all those
who plotted with him.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.799
Save only Riario.

33:55.866 --> 33:58.068
How do I know
you are not the imposter?

33:58.135 --> 34:00.537
Test us!

34:00.604 --> 34:06.509
Do you recall... why
I chose the name Sixtus...

34:06.577 --> 34:09.145
..when I became Pope?

34:09.213 --> 34:12.581
That I do. Because I
came from nothing.

34:12.650 --> 34:17.053
The name Sixtus
means polished.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.222
Refined.

34:19.290 --> 34:23.693
My private rebuke to those
who mocked my upbringing,

34:23.761 --> 34:25.795
when we were young scholars.

34:25.862 --> 34:28.531
Only you and I know that.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.902
See if the pretender does.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.050
You should look
where we're going.

34:47.118 --> 34:50.320
I calculated the speed of the current,
I have a compass to direct us.

34:50.387 --> 34:53.389
To be honest, I only put the window
there to keep you entertained.

34:53.456 --> 34:56.297
So you don't need to know about the
sunken wreck we're steering towards?

35:03.434 --> 35:05.535
Well, how close is it?

35:05.603 --> 35:08.238
Four braccia, maybe. Three?

35:08.305 --> 35:10.306
Pedal faster.
What?

35:10.374 --> 35:12.208
The current could save us.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.576
We'll use up air
if we speed up.

35:13.644 --> 35:16.546
Our ramming a submerged hull
might use up air as well.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.449
Quicker, faster.

35:40.404 --> 35:42.372
Oh!

35:45.242 --> 35:46.743
Oh, shit.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.344
We could be in for a bath.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.380
Which is better:
drowning, phyxiating,

35:50.447 --> 35:52.649
or surfacing and being punctured
by Alfonso's men?

35:52.716 --> 35:54.784
Just pedal. Hold your breath.

36:00.457 --> 36:02.325
You want help with that?

36:02.393 --> 36:04.994
I'm surprised you can
still walk after last night.

36:05.062 --> 36:07.130
<i>What were you up to?</i>

36:07.198 --> 36:09.499
<i>She was a beauty.</i>

36:15.639 --> 36:17.073
I was green with jealousy.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.309
<i>I'm surprised you</i>
<i>can keep her satisfied</i>

36:19.376 --> 36:20.376
<i>with what you've got</i>
<i>between your legs.</i>

36:25.649 --> 36:27.417
<i>Yeah, dream on, mate.</i>
<i>Dream on.</i>

36:31.055 --> 36:33.656
I am just a bit concerned we're
gonna die.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.226
We're almost there.
It will be night soon.

36:36.293 --> 36:39.028
You didn't calculate we'd be
losing buckets of air before.

36:50.274 --> 36:52.242
Success.

36:52.309 --> 36:56.679
Are we out?
Then it's not success.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.214
How long till darkness?

37:00.050 --> 37:01.417
An hour.

37:01.485 --> 37:05.088
Right.
Start patching these leaks.

37:05.155 --> 37:08.124
With what, exactly? The excrement
currently filling my pants?

37:09.660 --> 37:13.963
If you want our air to last,
try shutting up.

37:32.449 --> 37:36.152
Fabrizio, surely you know I shall
be dining alone this evening.

37:36.220 --> 37:39.289
My lady, I was told
there was a guest.

37:39.356 --> 37:44.160
Family should dine together.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.296
Guards! Who the hell are you?

37:46.363 --> 37:48.364
Carlo de Medici, my lady.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.935
Bastard son of Lorenzo's
grandfather Cosimo de Medici.

37:52.002 --> 37:55.471
Half-brother
to your father-in-law.

37:55.539 --> 37:59.375
I have lived here for years.
Why have I never met you?

37:59.443 --> 38:02.078
I have traveled many years
as a missionary.

38:02.146 --> 38:05.448
Until the cruelty of the world made
me doubt the Church and its message,

38:05.516 --> 38:08.685
as you have had reason
to doubt Rome yourself.

38:08.752 --> 38:11.154
Hearing of the threats
my family faces from the Pope

38:11.221 --> 38:13.289
I have returned home
to offer my aid.

38:13.357 --> 38:15.124
My family faces many enemies.

38:15.192 --> 38:18.261
You'll understand if I have
doubts as to your identity.

38:18.329 --> 38:22.665
The proof I belong here
is in the very walls.

38:35.145 --> 38:38.381
How fortuitous that you wanted
to see me, Lupo.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.183
How so, Your Holiness?

38:40.250 --> 38:44.654
A guard said you entered a tunnel
that's been untouched for centuries.

38:44.722 --> 38:48.524
Am I not free to come and go in
the Archives, as I wish?

38:48.592 --> 38:51.961
In fact, the reason I was there
was why I wish to see you.

38:52.029 --> 38:55.298
I've been wondering how we might observe
the anniversary of your papacy,

38:55.366 --> 38:58.901
and so sought to consult relics
from the last Pope Sixtus.

38:58.969 --> 39:02.839
But then thought
to seek your counsel.

39:04.074 --> 39:09.045
Why did you choose
the name...Sixtus, I wonder?

39:11.281 --> 39:13.683
No other Pope has gone by that
name in nearly a millennium.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.618
Were you not there
when I chose it?

39:15.686 --> 39:18.054
My age betrays me.

39:18.122 --> 39:22.492
My mind is no Secret Archive
holding everything.

39:33.537 --> 39:38.341
When I took the throne
Rome was in decay.

39:38.409 --> 39:42.345
I wanted to restore it to
the glory of an earlier era.

39:42.413 --> 39:45.681
Like Pope Sixtus The Third
before me,

39:45.749 --> 39:48.518
who built so much
of our city.

39:48.585 --> 39:51.287
Hm. Yes.

39:51.355 --> 39:54.090
How could I have
forgotten...

39:54.158 --> 39:55.992
Your Holiness?

40:06.537 --> 40:09.172
Lorenzo never
showed you this?

40:11.642 --> 40:14.177
There I am.

40:15.412 --> 40:19.182
Not as handsome as I am
in real life, I admit.

40:19.249 --> 40:22.985
And painted many...
many years ago.

40:24.388 --> 40:28.991
Fabrizio, you recognize me
from your childhood, no?

40:29.059 --> 40:32.929
When your father served at table
for Lorenzo's father and myself.

40:32.996 --> 40:35.731
Yes, I think so.
I was young.

40:35.799 --> 40:38.434
Do the servants still keep bottles
of acacia-blossom grappa?

40:38.502 --> 40:40.436
Hidden beneath the rags
in the cellar?

40:40.504 --> 40:42.305
They do indeed,
Your Grace.

40:42.372 --> 40:44.507
That was always
my favorite.

40:44.575 --> 40:48.711
Bring up a bottle.
I'd love to enjoy some now.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.827
Ah, it's getting hard
to breathe.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.170
Almost dark.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.545
Just a little while longer.

41:27.985 --> 41:34.524
Next time...I won't build this
submersible so quickly.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.994
Please...

41:39.229 --> 41:43.099
You have failed us,
Da Vinci.

41:43.167 --> 41:46.936
You are not the one we hoped.
You are not the one...

41:47.004 --> 41:51.240
It is a dark hour,
and your arrogant belief

41:51.308 --> 41:56.445
that you are capable of anything
has only made it darker.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.717
Leo.

42:03.554 --> 42:06.088
Leo!

42:21.638 --> 42:23.673
<i>Fire! Fire in the hold!</i>

42:25.642 --> 42:28.044
Put it out!

42:36.220 --> 42:39.989
Fire in the hold!

42:40.057 --> 42:43.192
<i>Upper deck!</i>
<i>More water!</i>

42:43.260 --> 42:46.295
Amerigo came through.

42:56.940 --> 42:59.408
Quick.

42:59.476 --> 43:01.877
<i>More water!</i>
<i>Get some more!</i>

43:01.945 --> 43:05.548
This sword I carry bears the
words "Freedom for the people".

43:05.616 --> 43:07.216
We will loose your chains.

43:07.284 --> 43:10.987
Fight with us to seize the ship and
we will grant you that freedom.

43:11.054 --> 43:13.089
They bring food for us soon.
You won't have enough time.

43:13.156 --> 43:15.791
Leo, these are serious locks.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.560
Right.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.796
Someone will have to distract Duke
Alfonso whilst you free them all.

43:20.864 --> 43:22.598
You'll find him
in his bedchamber.

43:22.666 --> 43:26.502
You can't take on Alfonso. Does
"ripped you to shit" mean anything?

43:26.570 --> 43:29.705
Two swords will not help that much.
The Duke is seemingly unbeatable.

43:29.773 --> 43:32.475
You said yourself you
can't best him man to man.

43:32.542 --> 43:34.477
Well, I'll redefine winning.

43:34.544 --> 43:36.345
Leo, you are hammered
from lack of air.

43:36.413 --> 43:39.515
He knows your weak spots.
Then work fucking fast.

43:39.583 --> 43:42.351
Don't let me get killed
for nothing, yeah?

43:45.455 --> 43:48.190
Vespucci.
Can you give me a hand?

43:49.259 --> 43:51.260
Vespucci!

44:04.474 --> 44:06.042
Well...

44:15.345 --> 44:17.767
I didn't think I needed
more motive to kill you.

44:17.792 --> 44:18.721
Clearly I was wrong.

44:18.722 --> 44:22.124
There's nowhere to run.
What's your strategy, knave?

44:24.227 --> 44:26.262
Do you know,
I could use some air.

44:35.906 --> 44:37.506
Actually,
I thank you.

44:37.574 --> 44:42.078
This will be even more satisfying
than screwing that Circassian gash.

45:25.455 --> 45:28.124
Time to accept your fate,
Da Vinci.

45:28.191 --> 45:30.159
I must confess
I was distracted

45:30.227 --> 45:32.528
by the thought
of your imminent defeat.

45:35.766 --> 45:37.900
It's almost a shame
to kill you.

45:37.968 --> 45:39.869
What a court
jester you'd make.

45:39.936 --> 45:42.138
Then again,

45:42.205 --> 45:45.040
what a trophy you'll make
for Father's museum.

45:46.476 --> 45:49.378
Aaargh!

45:56.386 --> 45:58.254
You asked about my strategy.

45:58.321 --> 46:00.990
Well, these souls
you carried into bondage,

46:01.057 --> 46:03.092
far outnumber your men.

46:03.160 --> 46:06.996
And they're rather motivated.
They will kill you...

46:07.063 --> 46:12.501
if you do not
deed this ship...to me.

46:16.606 --> 46:18.374
Now...

46:21.344 --> 46:25.848
Before you let him go...

46:34.691 --> 46:37.860
Aargh! Aargh!

46:39.095 --> 46:40.696
Aaargh!

46:47.404 --> 46:48.904
Toy.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.906
You read
my people's language.

46:50.974 --> 46:54.443
Yeah. Pick up what I can.

47:12.829 --> 47:14.129
I've seen what you intended.

47:14.197 --> 47:16.599
Now you have to choose...

47:16.666 --> 47:21.470
to serve the true Pope,
or a deceiver.

47:21.538 --> 47:25.508
But how did you...
of all people...

47:25.575 --> 47:27.343
..know this...

47:27.410 --> 47:29.945
when I did not?

47:30.013 --> 47:34.316
You wondered from the first why
Riario chose me as a spy.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.356
That prisoner is my father.

47:44.194 --> 47:46.462
What am I to do
with this knowledge?

47:46.530 --> 47:49.164
It's simple enough.
Take me to see him.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.704
Go on, move.

47:59.142 --> 48:00.776
You sail with this scum,
Captain?

48:00.844 --> 48:03.979
Understand, my lord,
my ship is my life,

48:04.047 --> 48:07.816
and my treasure -
whoever charters it.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.221
You would put the son
of King Ferrante

48:12.289 --> 48:15.190
on a pinnace
sailing back to Pisa?

48:15.258 --> 48:18.327
Naples will know of
this insult, Da Vinci.

48:18.395 --> 48:22.531
We will bury you and
every leader of Florence.

48:22.599 --> 48:23.966
Well, show them
your battle scar.

48:24.034 --> 48:27.803
Regale them
with every detail.

48:27.871 --> 48:30.339
Oh, particularly
the part where you lost.

48:37.981 --> 48:40.082
I'm indebted to you all.

48:40.150 --> 48:42.017
I hope you never
have to wear chains again.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.920
We thank you,
and pray you are right.

48:44.988 --> 48:48.257
And when we reach Cape Verdi, any of
you who do not wish to accompany us,

48:48.325 --> 48:53.062
to a new world...may leave.

48:53.129 --> 48:56.966
Your lives
will be your own again.

48:57.033 --> 48:59.868
But...

48:59.936 --> 49:01.837
we do still have need
of more crew...

49:01.905 --> 49:03.272
to brave the oceans with us.

49:03.340 --> 49:06.842
And we promise you,
we promise you half

49:06.910 --> 49:09.345
of whatever we find
on our journey.

49:09.412 --> 49:11.246
Free of your chains.

49:11.314 --> 49:15.184
As all should be
in the world I hope to see.

49:52.989 --> 49:56.125
How are you here?

49:56.192 --> 50:01.263
Where is the astrolabe to guide
you safely through the storms?

50:01.331 --> 50:05.067
Where is the map to lead you
to the Book of Leaves?

50:05.135 --> 50:09.838
So, I may...I may have deviated
from your plan,

50:09.906 --> 50:12.875
but I have not abandoned
my quest.

50:12.942 --> 50:14.977
In no future
that we perceived,

50:15.045 --> 50:18.080
did you find another ship.

50:18.148 --> 50:20.115
Maybe I'm making
my own future.

50:20.183 --> 50:24.753
There is a price for straying from
the course of the river of time.

50:24.821 --> 50:30.025
And it will be paid in the
blood of those who follow you.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.264
Instead of issuing
dire predictions,

50:35.331 --> 50:37.132
you might help me
get back on track.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.202
Better to let the river
carry you along,

50:40.270 --> 50:42.304
than to exhaust yourself
fighting it.

50:42.372 --> 50:44.273
Everything I...

50:44.340 --> 50:47.376
Everything
I have ever achieved

50:47.444 --> 50:51.313
has been accomplished
by fighting to exhaustion.

50:51.381 --> 50:54.183
I know no other way.

50:54.250 --> 50:57.753
This journey...

50:57.821 --> 51:02.791
..is entirely of your
own making, Da Vinci.

51:02.859 --> 51:04.760
So, know this.

51:04.828 --> 51:08.664
You will either lead us
all to illumination,

51:08.732 --> 51:10.799
or into further darkness.

51:10.867 --> 51:12.334
Who are you
talking to?

51:16.306 --> 51:17.840
Myself.
