00:34.990 --> 00:37.229
What happened to me
changed my life forever,

00:38.709 --> 00:42.147
and people say... this too shall pass,

00:43.266 --> 00:45.265
and I say, no, not for me.

00:46.025 --> 00:47.764
This is my story now.

01:41.118 --> 01:44.137
Are you waiting for the next 23?

01:44.237 --> 01:46.975
No, I can get the 188.

01:47.075 --> 01:49.074
Ah! Which is coming in,

01:49.714 --> 01:52.053
right. Okay, so...

01:52.153 --> 01:54.292
I'm just gonna go for it.

01:54.392 --> 01:55.571
Obviously you are way

01:55.671 --> 01:56.930
out of my league
(laughs)

01:57.030 --> 01:58.490
and I dunno if it's something about you

01:58.590 --> 01:59.929
or the fact that I can literally

02:00.029 --> 02:01.068
see your bus come down the road right now.

02:01.068 --> 02:02.608
But I'm, I'm feeling pretty emboldened

02:02.708 --> 02:04.087
so I'm just gonna say it.

02:04.187 --> 02:04.926
Would you like to come

02:05.026 --> 02:07.165
to a party...

02:07.265 --> 02:08.845
with me...

02:08.945 --> 02:09.804
now?

02:09.904 --> 02:11.903
(laughs) I gathered that,

02:13.462 --> 02:15.161
I dunno if you make a
habit of propositioning

02:15.261 --> 02:16.681
random strangers at bus shelters,

02:16.781 --> 02:19.639
but it's pretty unorthodox.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.598
Okay, so how does this usually go?

02:21.698 --> 02:23.917
Well, usually goes
and more often than not

02:24.017 --> 02:25.556
takes place in a bar, not a bus shelter.

02:25.656 --> 02:29.814
But can I buy you a drink?
(laughs)

02:31.454 --> 02:33.453
Can I buy you a drink?

02:34.732 --> 02:39.730
[Jess] Sorry.

02:42.248 --> 02:44.247
I'm Ben.

02:45.087 --> 02:47.086
I'm Jess.

02:49.565 --> 02:50.544
After it happened, I thought I'd

02:50.644 --> 02:52.643
never get over it.

02:54.482 --> 02:56.481
And you hear people say it a lot.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.139
Sometimes it's figurative and

03:00.239 --> 03:02.239
sometimes it's for effect.

03:03.718 --> 03:06.916
(calming music plays)

03:11.314 --> 03:15.732
But when I say it, it's
none of those things.

03:15.832 --> 03:17.971
It's just the truth.

03:45.337 --> 03:47.117
was...

devastated.

(Ben groans)

04:35.473 --> 04:36.692
[Jess] Come on.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.411
All right.

04:38.511 --> 04:39.931
[Jess] I'm tired already.
[Ben] We just started already,

04:40.031 --> 04:42.030
you kidding?
[Jess] Right.

04:42.629 --> 04:46.627
(gentle guitar music continues)

04:48.986 --> 04:50.685
It's gonna take forever.
[Ben] Yeah,

04:50.785 --> 04:51.885
I'm kind of regretting that

04:51.985 --> 04:53.984
top floor flat now.

04:57.062 --> 04:59.001
[Jess] Well done,

04:59.101 --> 05:01.100
can you grab me a beer?

05:02.979 --> 05:04.759
Do you know today's our 13 month

05:04.859 --> 05:05.558
and 3 week anniversary.

05:05.658 --> 05:07.917
- Anniversary what?
- Us.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.236
Yeah, I know, but what?

05:09.336 --> 05:10.636
First time we met, first time we

05:10.736 --> 05:11.835
went on a date, first time

05:11.935 --> 05:13.154
- that we...
- Mm.

05:13.254 --> 05:13.994
Although to be fair,

05:14.094 --> 05:15.673
I suppose the first time we met

05:15.773 --> 05:17.352
sort of became our first date,

05:17.452 --> 05:19.951
which also sort of became the first time.

05:20.051 --> 05:23.349
(Jess chuckles)

05:23.449 --> 05:24.909
- I love you.
- Well, you're bouncy

05:25.009 --> 05:26.348
aren't you?

05:26.448 --> 05:28.447
You just found us this flat.

05:30.326 --> 05:33.684
(gentle guitar playing)

05:37.203 --> 05:42.200
Ahhh! (Jess and Ben laughing)

05:43.320 --> 05:46.058
(Jess moans)

05:46.158 --> 05:49.677
(gentle guitar continues)

05:53.275 --> 05:56.693
(keys jingle and door opens)

05:56.793 --> 05:58.252
I need some tea and a wee

05:58.352 --> 05:59.092
and not necessarily

05:59.192 --> 06:00.251
- in that order.
- I've got a deadline

06:00.351 --> 06:01.291
- and I can't find them.
- Yeah,

06:01.391 --> 06:02.151
well I've not been down here

06:02.151 --> 06:03.290
for two weeks so whatever it is,

06:03.390 --> 06:05.389
you can't blame me.

06:11.426 --> 06:13.845
- You all right?
- Yeah

06:13.945 --> 06:14.964
Okay... Well I can tell

06:15.064 --> 06:16.084
that you're lying but you are late

06:16.184 --> 06:16.923
and I need some wee

06:17.023 --> 06:19.202
so I'm gonna let you off.

06:19.302 --> 06:21.301
Mum.

06:21.621 --> 06:23.680
Thanks for coming down.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.939
Wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

(soft angelic melody fades)

07:00.962 --> 07:03.141
Hey!
(door closes)

07:03.241 --> 07:04.540
Hey.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.539
- How'd it go?
- Good, yeah.

07:06.639 --> 07:08.218
I spoke to the features editor,

07:08.318 --> 07:10.017
Dee, and she said if I bump

07:10.117 --> 07:11.217
the piece off by 500 words

07:11.317 --> 07:12.056
then it can go on the

07:12.156 --> 07:13.456
- main paper.
- Do you want some cake?

07:13.556 --> 07:15.675
- Ehh... No.
- Are you sure?

07:17.274 --> 07:18.373
Yeah, why?

07:18.473 --> 07:19.453
Because I wanna tell you something,

07:19.553 --> 07:20.252
but I want you to be

07:20.352 --> 07:22.491
in a good mood when I do.

07:22.591 --> 07:24.590
Just tell me now.

07:26.869 --> 07:28.868
I'm pregnant.

07:31.147 --> 07:33.146
Tell me what you are feeling.

07:33.626 --> 07:35.625
Happy...

07:37.944 --> 07:39.883
and a bit scared

07:39.983 --> 07:41.982
but...

07:43.101 --> 07:45.240
but yeah,

07:45.340 --> 07:46.080
you're happy?

07:46.180 --> 07:46.919
I mean, it's what we've

07:47.019 --> 07:49.018
always wanted, isn't it

07:49.458 --> 07:50.837
you and me and a flat a family

07:50.937 --> 07:52.597
and I mean about 10 years too early.

07:52.697 --> 07:55.595
But... let's do it.
(Jess chuckles)

07:55.695 --> 07:56.715
I said let's do it, we've already done it,

07:56.815 --> 07:58.674
really, haven't we?
(Jess laughs)

07:58.774 --> 08:00.773
but sorry, erm...

08:01.092 --> 08:04.351
- if that's what you want.
- That's what I want.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.950
Don't mean it goes without saying,

08:06.050 --> 08:08.049
I'm terrified, but...

08:09.408 --> 08:11.407
yeah, that's what I want.

08:13.806 --> 08:16.565
(sharp exhaling)

08:17.524 --> 08:22.522
- I'm gonna get some cake.
- Yeah (Jess laughs)

08:24.201 --> 08:27.520
(soothing lively music)

08:28.919 --> 08:31.398
(Jess laughs)

(calming soothing music continues)

08:56.345 --> 08:57.845
(heartbeat continues)

08:57.945 --> 09:01.083
- So is this your first baby?
- What gave us away?

09:01.183 --> 09:01.923
(Ben and Doctor laugh)

09:02.023 --> 09:04.022
Yeah, we just want it to be okay.

09:06.181 --> 09:11.178
Well...
(heartbeat sounds)

09:11.578 --> 09:12.677
well, I can tell you

09:12.777 --> 09:15.196
that it is.
(Jess and Ben chuckle)

09:15.296 --> 09:16.476
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

09:16.576 --> 09:19.394
In fact, it's doubly okay

09:19.494 --> 09:20.713
See?

09:20.813 --> 09:21.573
You said you weren't allowed

09:21.573 --> 09:23.652
- to be certain
- because it's twins.

09:24.452 --> 09:27.130
- Wait...
- You're having twins.

09:31.528 --> 09:34.667
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

09:34.767 --> 09:37.685
(soft music plays)

09:39.444 --> 09:42.903
(strong crescendo starts)

09:43.003 --> 09:45.901
(strong crescendo fades)

09:46.001 --> 09:48.000
[Ben] Open it.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.978
(Jess sharply exhales)

09:52.078 --> 09:54.077
Oh, you just do it.

09:55.716 --> 09:58.715
(rustling of paper)

10:04.912 --> 10:06.971
It's a boy and a girl.

10:07.071 --> 10:08.650
(Jess sobs)

10:08.750 --> 10:10.749
What's wrong?

10:12.868 --> 10:17.006
I wanted a girl.
(Jess sobs)

10:17.106 --> 10:19.105
I know.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.363
I love him just as much though.

10:22.463 --> 10:24.162
I know.

10:24.262 --> 10:28.101
(calming melodic music plays)

10:30.419 --> 10:33.898
(calming music continues)

10:37.656 --> 10:39.655
Can I ask you a question?

10:40.894 --> 10:41.714
Nope.
(Dee chuckles)

10:41.814 --> 10:44.513
- Well, I'm gonna ask anyway.
- You're the boss.

10:44.613 --> 10:46.612
Literally.

10:47.171 --> 10:48.071
Look, I know I've asked you

10:48.171 --> 10:50.170
this before but since then,

10:51.369 --> 10:53.368
have you considered writing about it?

10:59.605 --> 11:01.604
Yes and no.

11:02.924 --> 11:04.923
Meaning?

11:05.242 --> 11:07.741
Yes, I've considered it and no,

11:07.841 --> 11:09.840
I'm not doing it.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.359
Why?

11:13.598 --> 11:17.576
Because I don't even
like to think about it,

11:17.676 --> 11:20.095
and if I were to write about it then

11:20.195 --> 11:23.913
I'd have to think about it a lot and...

11:26.232 --> 11:27.971
Well, some people think that

11:28.071 --> 11:30.070
by writing about a

11:31.190 --> 11:32.969
- difficult experience
- You help other people going

11:33.069 --> 11:35.128
through the same experience, yet,

11:35.228 --> 11:36.767
I don't believe that I, I'm sorry,

11:36.867 --> 11:38.866
but I don't...

11:41.585 --> 11:43.724
I can't do it.

11:43.824 --> 11:45.683
[Charlie] Right, ready?

11:45.783 --> 11:47.602
(everyone laughing)

11:47.702 --> 11:48.421
[Pam] Come, sit down before

11:48.421 --> 11:50.200
- you hurt yourself
- What? You used to love

11:50.300 --> 11:52.239
- my moves.
- I used to tolerate them.

11:52.339 --> 11:53.179
[Charlie] Hey, you
should have seen the way

11:53.179 --> 11:55.238
- your mother used to...
- Enough!

11:55.338 --> 11:57.337
- (Jess and Ben laugh)
- Come here!

11:58.696 --> 12:01.075
- Get off.
- Right there it is.

12:01.175 --> 12:04.653
(Charlie laughs)
My famous barbecue chicken.

12:05.533 --> 12:06.472
[Pam] What's famous about it?

12:06.572 --> 12:07.832
How dry it is.
[Charlie] You see what I'm

12:07.932 --> 12:09.791
- dealing with?
- I do. (Ben chuckles)

12:09.891 --> 12:14.309
Right, Ben I need to ask you something.

12:14.409 --> 12:16.308
Erm, so there are some obvious

12:16.408 --> 12:17.547
cultural differences

12:17.647 --> 12:18.746
- between us.
- Dad...

12:18.846 --> 12:19.686
[Charlie] No, no, no, it's important.

12:19.686 --> 12:22.185
I need to ask. Is it your intention

12:22.285 --> 12:23.664
to raise these children

12:23.764 --> 12:25.423
as Oldham fans?

12:25.523 --> 12:26.863
(Pam, Ben and Jess chuckle)

12:26.963 --> 12:29.701
- Indeed, yeah.
- I'm sorry, dad, I tried.

12:29.801 --> 12:30.821
[Ben] We've talked about buying them,

12:30.921 --> 12:31.820
those little... erm...

12:31.920 --> 12:34.259
- Oldham Athletic baby grows.
- That is never gonna happen.

12:34.359 --> 12:35.618
[Charlie] Hey, where you going?

12:35.718 --> 12:37.717
To the toilet.

12:38.197 --> 12:40.016
Mum?

12:40.116 --> 12:42.115
- Mum!
- Oh

12:46.433 --> 12:47.173
Promise me something...

12:56.988 --> 12:58.987
[Jess] Ben?!...

12:59.547 --> 13:02.465

13:03.545 --> 13:05.484
[Jess] Ben?!

13:11.501 --> 13:13.500
Ben!

13:13.900 --> 13:15.319
Ben...

13:15.419 --> 13:17.718
(door opens)

13:17.818 --> 13:20.476
I think the babies are coming.

13:20.576 --> 13:21.796
You all right?
(Jess moans)

13:21.896 --> 13:23.895
Are you sure?

13:24.215 --> 13:26.673
Okay, remember they
said this would happen.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.872
I'm scared. What do we do?

13:29.972 --> 13:32.191
Look at me, look at me.

13:32.291 --> 13:34.469
Everything and everyone

13:34.569 --> 13:36.888
is gonna be fine. I promise.

13:49.802 --> 13:54.500

13:54.600 --> 13:56.599
okay?

13:57.158 --> 13:59.177
- Love you.
- Love you too.

13:59.277 --> 14:01.336
[Dr. Jackson] Ready nurse?

14:01.436 --> 14:03.435
Here we go.

14:04.235 --> 14:07.074
(monitor beeping)

14:08.193 --> 14:10.292
All right?

14:10.392 --> 14:13.710
(emotional music plays)

14:15.789 --> 14:16.689
[Dr. Jackson] There we go...

14:16.789 --> 14:18.848
Here she is.

14:18.948 --> 14:23.945
[Jess] Ben?
(Jess and Ben laugh joyfully)

14:25.305 --> 14:27.544
Ben? Can you see?
[Ben] Yes.

14:28.983 --> 14:30.482
Why isn't she crying?

14:30.582 --> 14:31.342
[Dr. Jackson] She's just a little

14:31.342 --> 14:32.161
- quiet, that's all.
- Yeah,

14:32.261 --> 14:34.440

Hello, you.

14:43.456 --> 14:47.194
Hi (Ben chuckles)

14:47.294 --> 14:49.293
Hi.

14:50.452 --> 14:51.192
[Dr. Jackson] Okay, let's

put out a crash call.

14:55.850 --> 14:56.829
[Nurse Jones] Neonatal crash call.

14:56.929 --> 14:57.869
Theatre one.

14:57.969 --> 14:59.228
[Ben] What's happening?

14:59.328 --> 15:01.587
Everything's going to be fine.

15:01.687 --> 15:03.186
Nurses, anything?

15:03.286 --> 15:04.266
[Nurses] No.
[Dr. Jackson] Right,

15:04.366 --> 15:05.905
let's bag them immediately.

15:06.005 --> 15:06.744
What does that mean?

15:06.844 --> 15:08.064
It's best if you just stay back

15:08.164 --> 15:10.782
[Jess] Ben... what's happening?

15:10.882 --> 15:11.982
What's going on? What's going on?

15:12.082 --> 15:13.021
Are they okay?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.300
[Nurse Richards] Nothing here? Anything?

15:15.400 --> 15:16.660
[Nurse Jones] Not yet.

15:16.760 --> 15:17.979
[Nurse Richards] Come on little one,

15:18.079 --> 15:19.778
come on little one.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.217
[Nurse Jones] Breathing here,

15:21.317 --> 15:22.257
but faint.

15:22.357 --> 15:23.416
Breathing, good.

15:23.516 --> 15:24.276
[Nurse Richards] Breathing here too,

15:24.276 --> 15:26.455
but very faint, hardly anything.

15:26.555 --> 15:28.134
I need a fast scan and call

15:28.234 --> 15:29.973
peads and intensive care.

15:30.073 --> 15:31.732
[Nurse Jones] Losing it again...

15:31.832 --> 15:32.572
It's gone.

15:32.672 --> 15:33.531
Ben, do something
(Jess cries)

15:33.631 --> 15:34.671
I-I can't, I can't
[Male Nurse] Excuse me, please

15:34.671 --> 15:35.510
[Nurse Richards] Let's get them

15:35.510 --> 15:36.810
to ICU.

15:36.910 --> 15:37.669
[Jess] What's, what's happening?

15:37.669 --> 15:38.849
Which one's not breathing?

15:38.949 --> 15:41.188
[Nurse Richards] Daddy, are you coming?

15:43.307 --> 15:44.646
Don't leave them alone!

15:44.746 --> 15:46.285
[Ben] Wait! Wait! Jess,

15:46.385 --> 15:47.365
are you okay?
[Nurse Richards] Let's go.

15:47.465 --> 15:48.204
[Dr. Jackson] She'll be fine...

15:48.304 --> 15:50.963
- just... just go.
- I love you.

15:51.063 --> 15:52.082
This way.
[Ben] Which one's

15:52.182 --> 15:54.241
not breathing? Can you tell me

15:54.341 --> 15:56.340
which one's not breathing?

16:00.098 --> 16:01.678
[Jack] Daddy?
[Ben] Yes, Jack.

16:01.778 --> 16:03.797
Why are we going quick, quick?

16:03.897 --> 16:05.076
Because you took too long

16:05.176 --> 16:05.995
with your honey on toast

16:06.095 --> 16:08.074
and I couldn't find your other shoe

16:08.174 --> 16:09.274
and yeah, it's a combination

16:09.374 --> 16:12.712
- of factors.
- What does that mean?

16:12.812 --> 16:15.091
It means lots of reasons.

16:16.290 --> 16:18.289
Come on this way.

16:19.409 --> 16:22.567
(melodic music plays)

16:25.406 --> 16:29.404
(melodic piano music continues)

16:33.362 --> 16:37.360
(melodic piano music continues)

16:38.680 --> 16:40.619
How's Jack?

16:40.719 --> 16:42.857
He's good.

16:42.957 --> 16:46.716
(soft piano music continues)

16:48.035 --> 16:50.294
- Where is erm...?
- Shh..shh... shh

16:50.394 --> 16:52.393
she's there.

16:52.833 --> 16:56.311
(sentimental music plays)

16:59.269 --> 17:02.848
(sentimental music continues)

17:02.948 --> 17:06.846
(baby coos)
(Jess laughs)

17:06.946 --> 17:08.485
Oh, he likes the rabbit.

17:08.585 --> 17:12.803
- (baby Jack cries)
- Oh... no he doesn't.

17:12.903 --> 17:14.322
(Ben and Jess laugh)

17:14.422 --> 17:16.281
Yeah, that's thirty quid

17:16.381 --> 17:18.380
well spent.

17:19.819 --> 17:23.917
(baby Jack cries)

17:24.017 --> 17:26.656
[Ben] Do you wanna try and feed?

17:27.895 --> 17:31.214
(baby Jack cries)

17:34.092 --> 17:37.591
Okay, so remember nipples to nose.

17:37.691 --> 17:39.590
See how it goes.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.689
Hello?

17:48.925 --> 17:50.924
Oh! He's doing it.

17:53.283 --> 17:56.122
So... I've been thinking

17:57.801 --> 18:00.260
about what I want to give them.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.359
In life...

18:02.878 --> 18:03.618
and I don't know

18:03.718 --> 18:06.137
if it's because I'm sleep deprived or

18:06.237 --> 18:07.076
the fact that I've been staring

18:07.076 --> 18:10.215
at that wall for the last six hours

18:10.315 --> 18:12.314
but I think I've realised what it is.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.392
Huh?

18:17.511 --> 18:19.510
[Jess] Intensive care.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.788
(Ben and Jess laugh)

18:25.507 --> 18:28.006
[Nurse Richards] Just keep it clean.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.445
(indistinct chatter)

18:29.545 --> 18:31.544
Yes.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.963
That's our taxi.

18:34.063 --> 18:34.863
Listen, I'm sure you hear this

18:34.863 --> 18:35.642
all the time...

18:35.742 --> 18:37.641
but thank you so much...
[Jess] Yeah.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.680
For everything.
[Jess] Thank you.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.779
Wow. Good luck.

18:42.779 --> 18:45.517
[Ben] Come on then.

18:45.617 --> 18:47.616
[Jess] Come on daddy...

18:49.136 --> 18:51.575
(baby cries)

18:52.654 --> 18:54.353
You ready to be a parent?

18:54.453 --> 18:55.353
Not even nearly.

18:55.453 --> 18:57.452
[Ben] Yeah, me neither.

19:01.330 --> 19:02.029
I thought you said

19:02.129 --> 19:04.108
- you'd been practising .
- Yeah, I have.

19:04.208 --> 19:06.207
No, it doesn't show.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.625
Right, I'll go and get

19:10.725 --> 19:12.424
your bag and we're away.

19:12.524 --> 19:14.523
Okay...

19:16.922 --> 19:18.741
Ouch..oooh

19:18.841 --> 19:20.580

19:20.680 --> 19:21.980
