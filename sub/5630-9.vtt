00:01.702 --> 00:02.870
- You know, we all heard about
what we were doing for that boy.

00:04.272 --> 00:07.175
- I just want to thank you
for making him happy.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.377
- That's a woman in warning
with a psychotic ex-husband.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.943
- It's under control.

00:10.978 --> 00:15.049
- 15 years ago, you were a girl
barely surviving on the street.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.884
- Chicago P.D.
Put your hands up.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.452
- I'm proud of you, Erin.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.721
You're about the best thing
ever happened to me.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.190
- And you're my family.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.729
[siren wailing]

00:35.136 --> 00:36.937
- Voight, how's dry land
treating you?

00:36.970 --> 00:38.872
- Still standing.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.008
- I bet this view
never gets old.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.476
- Fourth of July,
it's the best.

00:42.510 --> 00:46.080
When it's 20-below in January,
I dream of a heated firehouse.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.781
- Where's this floater?

00:47.815 --> 00:49.650
- These yacht club guys
claim they took

00:49.683 --> 00:50.984
their boat out to fish

00:51.018 --> 00:52.453
and were casting their nets
for live bait.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.854
- Huh.
- Nearly fell overboard

00:53.887 --> 00:55.223
when they pulled this in.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.128
- I'm thinking
unnatural causes.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.929
- That's why I called you.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.497
We get floaters
every few months,

01:03.531 --> 01:05.899
but not like this.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.737
- Look at that.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.706
Looks like a small-caliber
entry wound.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.874
She's still got her teeth.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.476
We should upload them to ViCAP,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.745
see if we can ID her
from her dental records.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.580
- If we want any real shot
at ID'ing her,

01:19.613 --> 01:22.583
we're gonna need
the rest of the body.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.185
They got GPS.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.287
- Oh, they've got a lot more
than that.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.756
- Let's retrace their path.

*

01:45.306 --> 01:46.807
It's been a few hours.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.942
It's possible the current
swept the body out further.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.511
- Can we give it
a few more minutes?

01:50.544 --> 01:51.712
- I'm not gonna fight overtime,

01:51.745 --> 01:54.182
but my guys only got
15 minutes of air left.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.916
- All right, thanks, Carter.

01:55.949 --> 02:03.324
*

02:03.357 --> 02:04.758
- My first year on patrol,

02:04.792 --> 02:07.695
I responded to this call
at Douglas Park.

02:07.728 --> 02:11.699
A jogger saw a hand sticking out
of the lagoon,

02:11.732 --> 02:14.735
so a marine unit came
and drained it,

02:14.768 --> 02:17.638
and they found two more bodies.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.642
- Mother killed her two boys.

02:21.675 --> 02:25.813
- Yeah, she tied them together
with an extension cord.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.750
That kind of thing
never leaves you.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.221
- Diver one just located
an object on the bottom.

Open up.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.371
She said she was here.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.638
- Yeah, I don't hear anything.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.840
- All right, on three.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.278
One, two...

03:30.311 --> 03:31.979
- Sean.
- Callie.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.314
- [sobbing]

03:33.347 --> 03:34.748
- Come on.

03:34.782 --> 03:35.783
What happened?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.719
- So my ex, Ritchie,
he was loaded

03:38.752 --> 03:41.322
and asking about Andrew
and some of his stuff,

03:41.355 --> 03:43.291
and saying that Andrew
was his boy too,

03:43.291 --> 03:44.892
and I told him
to sleep it off,

03:44.925 --> 03:46.126
and he just went crazy.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.828
- Okay, we are gonna take you
to the district

03:47.861 --> 03:49.096
to file an order of protection.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.131
- An order of protection
didn't work the first time.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.666
A guy like this
needs to learn a lesson.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.034
- No, please, don't.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.403
It will just make it worse.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.938
- Do you have any place
you can stay, family or friends?

03:57.971 --> 03:59.607
- She shouldn't have to leave
her own home because of him.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.775
- Sean, you know the odds are
he's coming back.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.777
- No, he's not.

04:03.811 --> 04:08.816
*

04:11.184 --> 04:12.386
- Good news.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.222
Both head and body belong
to the same person.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.324
- Was there any doubt?

04:16.357 --> 04:18.692
- The pieces they pull
from the Chicago River,

04:18.726 --> 04:21.862
you never know.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.631
She was early 20s.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.900
And water decomps
are tough to pinpoint.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.502
- Ballpark time of death?

04:28.536 --> 04:31.104
- Best guess,
your victim died a week ago

04:31.138 --> 04:34.342
from strangulation as indicated
by the fractured hyoid

04:34.342 --> 04:35.376
in the victim's neck.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.677
- These holes aren't
gunshot wounds.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.112
- You're right.
They were made by a power drill.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.882
Whoever killed this girl
knew what they were doing.

04:41.915 --> 04:45.586
They drilled holes
so the body would sink.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.088
- [sighs]

04:48.121 --> 04:50.358
Just get us something,

04:50.358 --> 04:53.494
anything we can use
to ID her.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.898
M.E. was able to pull
a couple usable prints

04:57.931 --> 04:59.232
off our victim's hand.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.370
ID came back as Victoria Wasson,
26.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.372
She was in the system
for simple possession.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.907
- She used to be a dancer
at the strip club Deluxe.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.108
- It's up on Kingsbury.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.378
Raided it a few times
when I was in VICE.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.480
It's an Outfit joint,
totally protected.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.082
- So, Victoria saw something
she wasn't supposed to,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.484
and the Outfit killed her
for it.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.419
- Give the way the body
was drilled full of holes

05:18.452 --> 05:20.253
so it would sink,
that's a strong possibility.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.424
- Hey, this Victoria could have
crossed paths with all kinds,

05:23.457 --> 05:26.193
dealers, stalkers,
jealous exes.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.862
Let's put the pieces together,
start building a timeline.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.198
- Closest next of kin
is Victoria's little sister.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.434
She's a sophomore at CCU.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.669
She shouldn't have to see
her sister's body like this,

05:35.703 --> 05:38.439
so me and Jay will do
the notification.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.307
- I'll hit the strip club
with Antonio.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.709
- Yeah,
right after you hit the ATM.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.545
- Al, you go with.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.179
- Hank.
- Hmm?

05:47.247 --> 05:48.649
- I've got to be honest.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.084
Every time a case involves the
Outfit, I get a little worried.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.920
- Don't be.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.522
- You remember
they're a social club,

05:54.555 --> 05:56.089
and your father
was a member there.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.691
- Nobody's getting
special treatment.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.428
The Outfit's involved, we hit
them with everything we go.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.330
Until then,
I need more than speculation.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.432
- Right.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.902
- We didn't see each other
a lot.

06:08.936 --> 06:14.107
Vickie worked nights,
and I had class most days.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.910
- When was the last time
you saw your sister?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.178
- Last Friday.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.683
She came home, and she said
a friend was flying her down

06:22.716 --> 06:24.251
to Cabo for the week.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.787
- Did your sister mention
his name?

06:26.820 --> 06:29.356
- Vickie had a lot of friends,

06:29.457 --> 06:31.224
guys she met at work.

06:31.258 --> 06:34.995
I never knew their names.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.297
Our parents died in a car wreck
six years ago,

06:37.330 --> 06:40.668
and...and Vickie stepped up
and decided

06:40.701 --> 06:42.470
she was gonna take care
of us both.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.071
She worked all kinds of jobs.

06:44.104 --> 06:48.041
She--she even started dancing
at that club

06:48.075 --> 06:50.077
to help me pay for school.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.981
- Listen.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.584
We don't care how your sister
lived her life.

06:56.617 --> 07:01.054
We just care about finding out
who did this to her.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.160
- We know Victoria was seeing
customers outside the club.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.762
We just want the names
of her regulars.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.363
- What, you think
I take names at the door?

07:10.397 --> 07:11.632
- That's not a bad idea.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.900
Maybe I'll park
a couple squads out front,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.001
see what that does
for business.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.068
- [scoffs]

07:15.102 --> 07:16.504
You know who owns this place?

07:16.504 --> 07:18.338
Yeah, you go ahead,
make your calls.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.607
We'll make ours.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.409
[dance music playing]

07:22.510 --> 07:24.277
- Ladies, come on.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.379
Help us out here.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.848
The quicker we get through
with this,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.382
the quicker you get back
to work.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.184
I've got to think one of you was
at least friendly with Victoria,

07:31.218 --> 07:33.854
so one more time,
did she ever mention

07:33.887 --> 07:35.623
having a problem
with one of her customers?

07:35.656 --> 07:38.792
- Now this is what your coworker
looked like

07:38.826 --> 07:41.829
when they pulled her out
of the river.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.901
See?

07:47.935 --> 07:50.538
- [gasps]

07:50.538 --> 07:55.008
- Ah, somebody's got a heart.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.544
- We worked Tuesdays together.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.378
- Okay.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.847
- I just--
I can't believe someone

07:59.880 --> 08:01.414
would want to do that to her.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.883
- Yeah.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.053
Do you know anybody
who'd want to hurt her?

08:07.955 --> 08:12.626
- Which one of those
is Victoria's?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.562
- The one with the stickers.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.797
- Oh, okay, thanks.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.800
[dark music]

08:19.833 --> 08:22.570
*

08:22.570 --> 08:24.437
- That's club property.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.273
You got a warrant?

08:26.306 --> 08:29.677
- Well...it kind of
looks open to me.

08:34.582 --> 08:38.184
*

08:38.217 --> 08:40.888
Huh.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.057
Oh, I bet you these weren't used
for buying beer.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.831
- Sean, all I'm saying,
it's a domestic.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.900
You should maintain
a professional distance.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.669
- Let's see what Platt says.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.137
Sarge,
you got a sec?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.305
- [chuckles]

08:58.338 --> 08:59.840
I got a lifetime.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.508
It is a beautiful autumn day,

09:01.609 --> 09:03.076
and I have the best job
in the world,

09:03.110 --> 09:06.113
and last night,
I found this in Randy's truck.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.815
Engagement rings.

09:07.848 --> 09:11.051
I think the old dog
is gonna bend a knee.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.285
- Wow,
that's amazing.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.353
- We got a problem.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.322
Do you remember Andrew's mom?

09:15.355 --> 09:17.925
Her ex is causing trouble,
and I want to use his shift

09:17.958 --> 09:19.526
to track him down
before things go south.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.294
- Look at that.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.497
It's like a ray of sunshine
around your finger.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.036
- Sarge,
so you good with that?

09:30.437 --> 09:33.306
- Yeah, yeah,
whatever you think is best.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.407
- I'm gonna put together
a photo, I'll be right up.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.644
- See you in the car.
- Hey.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.645
- Hey.
Yeah.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.212
- Hey, Burgess.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.547
- Sergeant.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.751
- I'll bet you 20 bucks
I get hitched before you do.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.320
- Okay, we'll see.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.689
- Uh-huh.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.660
- Hey, so I just spoke
to Financial Crimes

09:52.660 --> 09:55.829
about the IDs we found
in Victoria's locker.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.965
Apparently, they've been looking
for the pretty face

09:57.998 --> 10:00.167
behind these check-kiting
schemes for months now.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.601
They just didn't know
her real name.

10:01.635 --> 10:05.673
As Jen Turner, she bilks
35 grand from Citibank.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.176
As Beth Hampton,
44,000 at Bank of America.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.213
And as Lana Del Rio, a cool,
clean 56 grand from Chase.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.749
- Bottom line is, she's cashed
over half a million dollars

10:15.783 --> 10:17.317
worth of counterfeit
treasury checks.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.319
- That's an old-school
Outfit scam,

10:19.352 --> 10:21.321
using young, attractive women
to rip off bankers

10:21.354 --> 10:23.523
with that fugazi paper
instead of guns.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.092
- Yep, the girls keep 10%,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.493
kick the rest back
to their handler.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.561
That's how the Outfit
keeps their hands clean.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.231
- So, do we loop in
organized crime?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.333
- I'll do the digging.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.970
- When?

10:37.004 --> 10:41.441
- I got to run my schedule
by you now?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.943
- Look,
whatever this girl was into,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.277
she didn't deserve
to end up dead

10:44.311 --> 10:45.278
in the bottom of the river.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.479
We know this was Outfit,
so--

10:46.513 --> 10:48.048
- So now you're gonna tell me
what she did

10:48.081 --> 10:51.885
and did not deserve,
like I don't know?

10:51.919 --> 10:55.689
- I'm just asking what
the game plan is here.

10:55.723 --> 10:59.392
- Keeping looking into
Victoria's known associates.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.197
- [laughs softly]

11:04.231 --> 11:05.733
Okay.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.267
- I heard that once.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.103
- Hey, jag-off.
Someone call 911?

11:10.137 --> 11:12.239
- Yeah, I heard you need help
getting out of that chair.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.175
- I love you too.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.744
- Hey, Carlo.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.211
- Hank.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.013
- Hank, pull up a seat.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.749
- Actually, I was hoping
we could talk someplace

11:21.749 --> 11:24.417
a little more discreet.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.119
- This is a social club.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.988
Be social.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.589
- [sighs]

11:34.862 --> 11:38.198
It's about a girl that works
at one of your clubs, Deluxe.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.904
- Well, you could say that
I'm a silent partner.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.440
I heard that your guys
were already out there.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.509
They didn't find
what they needed?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.779
- Got a few more questions.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.213
- Mm.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.515
Well, Frank here knows more
about the day-to-day than I do,

11:55.548 --> 11:58.051
and he can answer
any questions you got.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.188
- Outside?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.523
- Yeah.
- Great.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.065
The girl who cashed these,

12:12.099 --> 12:14.367
we fished her out of the river.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.977
- Shame,
beautiful girl like this.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.450
- Not anymore.

12:30.483 --> 12:35.522
*

12:35.555 --> 12:37.557
Look, Frank...

12:39.492 --> 12:41.528
I'm here as a courtesy.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.630
I know she was hooked into
a check scam

12:43.663 --> 12:47.367
that possibly tracks back here.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.872
Now, I'm counting on you
being straight with me.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.842
I need a name...

12:54.875 --> 12:57.077
or Financial Crimes
is gonna start looking into

12:57.110 --> 13:00.080
how you pay your rent.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.514
*

13:01.548 --> 13:05.652
- So any cash that this girl
may or may not have kicked up

13:05.685 --> 13:08.889
to certain people,
you're not interested?

13:08.922 --> 13:11.191
*

13:11.224 --> 13:14.494
- As far as I'm concerned,
that's the FDIC's problem.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.565
- Okay.

[suspenseful music]

13:23.670 --> 13:31.111

13:31.144 --> 13:32.645

- Clear.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.323

13:43.356 --> 13:45.492
- Door on the right, go.

Go, go, go.

- Aah!
[grunting]

14:19.192 --> 14:22.162

14:22.195 --> 14:24.264
- Augh!
Aah!

14:24.297 --> 14:25.632
- Hands up.
Let me see your hands.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.067
- Aah!

14:32.305 --> 14:33.941
- Make one more move.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.142
Turn around!

14:35.175 --> 14:36.409
On your face.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.577
Hands behind your back.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.246
- You good?

14:39.279 --> 14:40.580
- No.

14:49.990 --> 14:50.123
.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.792
- Charlie Koslow, Polish kid,
grew up on Taylor Street.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.396
He was an up-and-coming enforcer
for the Outfit.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.299
- Then he shattered some guy's
jaw over a parking spot,

14:59.332 --> 15:01.568
and the judge
gave him five years.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.970
Six months into his sentence,

15:03.003 --> 15:06.006
he pissed off some GDs,
who dropped a 45-pound plate

15:06.039 --> 15:08.575
on his head, putting him
in a coma for two months.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.543
His prison psych profile
says after that,

15:10.577 --> 15:12.745
he never fully recovered
mentally.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.047
- Who gave us Koslow?

15:14.081 --> 15:15.415
- Concerned citizen.

15:15.448 --> 15:19.319
- I went back to Deluxe
and flashed Koslow's picture.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.255
Now, Victoria's dancer friend
Sage said that she saw Koslow

15:22.289 --> 15:25.292
arguing with Victoria
the night she disappeared.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.998
- So an up-and-coming
mob enforcer

15:30.998 --> 15:33.333
gets his bell rung
in a prison weight pile.

15:33.366 --> 15:38.038
Next thing he knows,
people stop being afraid of him,

15:38.071 --> 15:40.007
so the Outfit puts X enforcer

15:40.007 --> 15:42.309
out to pasture
with a counterfeit check scheme.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.612
That you?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.214
- Come on, Charlie,
what happened to you?

15:47.247 --> 15:51.184
You and Victoria
have a falling out?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.253
- No.

15:53.286 --> 15:57.690
Vickie was...

15:57.724 --> 16:00.027
I would never hurt her.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.262
- Listen,

16:02.295 --> 16:06.599
whatever amount she was holding
back from your phony checks,

16:06.633 --> 16:10.470
I mean,
it wasn't enough to kill her.

16:10.503 --> 16:14.041
Look, if I'm you,
I'd come clean, make a deal.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.508
- Why don't you tell us
about the fight

16:15.542 --> 16:18.911
you and Victoria
had outside Deluxe?

16:20.280 --> 16:25.285
- Friends sometimes
tell each other the truth.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.290
I didn't like
who she was seeing.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.725
- That's it?

16:32.759 --> 16:36.763
You didn't like her boyfriend,
or you wanted her for yourself?

16:38.198 --> 16:41.201
You wanted her to be
more than just a check girl?

Jim Shelte.

- You, stop talking.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.388

with my client alone.

[indistinct chatter]

17:14.534 --> 17:16.403
- Hey, Denny,
where's your brother Ritchie?

17:16.435 --> 17:18.771
And don't say you don't know,
because I know he stays with you

17:18.805 --> 17:20.207
whenever he's in town.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.242
- Yeah, thanks for making me
look like some sort of snitch.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.377
- What,
you got a rep to uphold?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.213
We can make it look like
a lot worse if you don't

17:26.246 --> 17:27.680
tell me where Ritchie is.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.981
- I haven't seen him in months.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.117
- Hey, your brother's

17:30.150 --> 17:31.684
got his ex-wife Callie
pretty shook up.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.454
We're trying to talk to him
before he does something stupid.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.888
- Yeah, Ritchie mentioned you.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.125
You're that cop
making a move on Callie?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.762
What kind of man takes advantage
of a grieving woman?

17:42.795 --> 17:44.597
- Ask me that again.
- Roman, take a walk.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.965
Roman, you take a walk.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.000
Roman.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.207
And, you, you see Ritchie,
call that number.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.583

[door opens]

18:05.152 --> 18:07.754
- Counselor.
- Yeah.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.758
- Well, I think we can all agree
no matter how we look at this,

18:11.791 --> 18:14.161
it's tragic,
and no one,

18:14.161 --> 18:15.862
least of all
Mr. Koslow here,

18:15.895 --> 18:18.030
wants to cause Victoria Wasson's
family any more grief

18:18.064 --> 18:19.999
or waste any more of CPD's time.

18:20.032 --> 18:24.036
With that in mind,
Charlie's prepared to confess.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.040
But we will need
some assurances.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.010
- What are we talking?

18:31.043 --> 18:32.179
- Manslaughter
instead of first-degree

18:32.179 --> 18:33.546
and protective custody
in prison.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.881
As you know,
Charlie has a history

18:34.914 --> 18:37.650
of being targeted by rival gangs
on the inside.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.019
- I want to
hear it from you.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.103

18:57.204 --> 19:00.907
30,000 from the checks.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.875
If she didn't pay,
it was me who was gonna--

19:02.909 --> 19:04.611
- My client panicked.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.712
They fought.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.215
Wasn't premeditated.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.218

19:11.251 --> 19:12.752
- Huh.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.255
*

19:15.288 --> 19:17.257
Why the sudden
change of heart?

19:17.290 --> 19:20.227
- He's sick with remorse,

19:20.227 --> 19:22.629
and while a confession
won't bring forgiveness,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.897
perhaps it
will bring some closure.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.500
A search of this address
will turn up the boat

19:27.534 --> 19:30.837
and the tools he used
to dispose of the body.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.619
- What do you mean?

19:46.653 --> 19:49.155
Half an hour ago,
he was saying he didn't do it.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.424
- Changed his mind.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.660
- Based on what?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.128
A public defender could get him
off on what we have right now.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.265
- Guess we're lucky
he came clean.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.267
- Did he come clean,
or did his mobbed-up lawyer

20:00.267 --> 20:01.634
get him to take one
for the team?

20:01.668 --> 20:02.902
- I'll tell you what,

20:02.935 --> 20:04.837
you want to volunteer
for the Innocence Project?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.072
I'll get you that number.

Right now,
we got a case to close.

- Not even a partial.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.889
Gotta assume your guy
was wearing gloves.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.825

everything, get it to the lab.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.026
- Thanks.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.761
Hey, that was the DMV.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.597
The last person the boat
was registered to

20:30.630 --> 20:31.831
died two years ago.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.165
Then the title
never gets transferred,

20:33.199 --> 20:35.134
and all the storage fees
have been paid in cash.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.736
- Great.
- And I'm not so sure

20:36.769 --> 20:38.204
it was used to
dispose of the body.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.472
- What do you mean?

20:39.506 --> 20:41.674
- My techs sprayed the whole
cabin and deck with luminol.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.343
Not a single trace of blood.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.478
If your killer used this boat
to transport the body,

20:45.512 --> 20:47.314
a body that was
drilled full of holes,

20:47.347 --> 20:49.616
no way it'd be this spotless.

20:56.356 --> 20:56.489
.

20:57.724 --> 20:58.157
- Searched the boat.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.593
Crime techs found
zero physical evidence

21:00.627 --> 21:03.596
tying Koslow to the boat
or to Victoria's body.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.332
- They had a week
to clean it up.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.335
- Forensic says the way
the body was desecrated,

21:08.335 --> 21:11.170
then that'd be impossible,
so if this was Koslow, he--

21:11.203 --> 21:12.605
- If?

21:12.639 --> 21:16.343
He confessed.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.011
- Will give us a minute?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.184
You remember the summer
I moved in with you?

21:25.217 --> 21:28.455
The cartage warehouse over on
Cermak got knocked off,

21:28.488 --> 21:31.090

got killed.

to Joliet for murder.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.201
- And?

21:42.234 --> 21:43.970
- And it wouldn't be
the first time the Outfit

21:44.003 --> 21:46.373
sent somebody up the river for
something that they didn't do.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.140
- Careful what you're implying.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.443
- I'm not implying anything.

to Victoria Wasson,

22:03.923 --> 22:05.191
but the odd thing is,

22:05.224 --> 22:08.495
there's even more calls
to Lauren Wasson.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.997
That's Victoria's
younger sister.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.198
I mean, it looks like Charlie--

22:12.231 --> 22:14.734
he was in a relationship
with both girls.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.404
- Which Lauren
neglected to mention.

22:17.404 --> 22:21.140
*

22:21.173 --> 22:23.776
Lauren, why weren't you straight
with us from the beginning?

22:23.810 --> 22:25.978
- I already told you
everything I know.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.748
- You left out the part
where you're dating the guy

22:28.781 --> 22:31.918
who's scammed treasury checks
with your sister,

22:31.951 --> 22:34.521
who also just confessed
to killing her.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.256
- Wait, Charlie confessed?

22:37.289 --> 22:39.125
No, no, no way.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.893
- So how about you
tell us the truth then?

22:40.927 --> 22:42.729
Unless you want your boyfriend
going to prison

22:42.762 --> 22:43.896
for a murder he didn't commit.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.898
- Okay, I wanted to tell you,

22:45.932 --> 22:48.868
I swear, but you saw
what they did to Vickie.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.437
- Who's they?

22:50.470 --> 22:51.438
Did someone threaten you?

22:51.471 --> 22:52.439
- I don't know their names.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.440
They're...

22:55.442 --> 22:57.009
Okay, look, all you need to know

22:57.043 --> 22:59.946
is that Charlie was with me
the night Vickie disappeared.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.013
I swear.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.082
- And you can prove that?

23:03.115 --> 23:06.453
- We--we went to the silent
movie theater on Clark,

23:06.486 --> 23:08.455
and then he stayed the night
at my dorm.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.623
- Did he sign the guestbook
at the front desk?

23:10.657 --> 23:12.191
- Guys aren't allowed
past 10:00,

23:12.224 --> 23:15.462
so Charlie always sneaks
in through the garage.

[dark music]

23:26.706 --> 23:28.908

23:28.941 --> 23:32.512

23:35.848 --> 23:38.284
- Want some zeppoles with that?

23:38.317 --> 23:42.321
- I don't really have
an appetite.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.957
Have a seat.

23:44.991 --> 23:52.965
*

23:52.999 --> 23:55.001
- What do you want to know?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.605
- Who really killed
Victoria Wasson?

24:00.873 --> 24:03.175
It's not there.

24:03.209 --> 24:08.881

24:08.915 --> 24:11.383
This isn't that kind of meeting,
Frank, come on.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.224
I mean, you and me...

24:19.592 --> 24:20.927

24:22.862 --> 24:25.632
- You and me got
a lot of history.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.901
I've always held up my end
of the bargain till now.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.903
Give me a name.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.239
I won't go after the money,

24:33.272 --> 24:36.275
but tell me the truth.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.549
You feed me a patsy?

24:42.582 --> 24:46.553
- Do us all a favor,
would you, huh?

24:46.586 --> 24:49.556
You got a confession
from Koslow.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.559
Just take the kid at his word.

24:52.592 --> 24:59.265
*

24:59.298 --> 25:03.603
- I've done...plenty of things

25:03.636 --> 25:05.972
that I'm not proud of.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.576
Sending an innocent man
to prison

25:09.576 --> 25:12.579
is never gonna be one of them.

25:12.579 --> 25:17.750
*

25:17.784 --> 25:20.152
- Boss, hey.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.722
Platt's on my ass about
getting Koslow out of lockup,

25:22.755 --> 25:25.157
in front of a judge
for arraignment.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.894
- Final autopsy results
came in for Victoria Wasson.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.295
Turns out at the time
of her death,

25:29.328 --> 25:30.830
she was 16 weeks pregnant.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.464
- And Victoria's little sister
Lauren

25:32.498 --> 25:33.633
was with Charlie Koslow...

25:33.666 --> 25:35.001
- Who she was banging.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.903
- The night that he
supposedly killed Victoria.

25:36.936 --> 25:40.306
Two of Lauren's dorm mates will
confirm that they saw him there.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.876
- All right,
get Koslow back up here,

25:43.910 --> 25:46.112
and tell Platt we haven't
officially charged him yet.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.015
Still an open investigation.

25:49.048 --> 25:53.986
- I know why you confessed
to Victoria's murder,

25:54.020 --> 25:57.189
'cause you were protecting
Lauren.

25:57.223 --> 26:01.661
You eat the charges, and she
doesn't get hurt, am I right?

26:01.694 --> 26:05.497
- You talked to Lauren?

26:05.531 --> 26:07.366
She okay?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.902
- Yeah, she's in police custody.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.439
I'd say right now you need to
think about helping yourself.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.776
- Charlie,
we know you were with Lauren

26:16.809 --> 26:20.546
the night Victoria
was murdered.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.749
You listening?

26:22.782 --> 26:25.384
Hey.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.120
We need to know
who put you up to this.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.525
- I tell you,
they kill me.

26:35.194 --> 26:38.798
Better off going back
to Stateville.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.467
- Did you know
Victoria was pregnant?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.870
[dark music]

26:43.903 --> 26:47.006
We think that's the motive here.

26:47.039 --> 26:50.576
You said you didn't like
the guy she was seeing.

26:50.677 --> 26:53.946
So, who is he, Charlie?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.683
Who could be the father here?

26:56.683 --> 27:01.954
*

27:01.988 --> 27:04.724
- Charlie.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.693
Charlie.

27:10.697 --> 27:13.700
I know how manipulative
these guys can be.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.868

27:15.902 --> 27:17.870
Family.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.872
Loyalty.

27:19.906 --> 27:23.442
Honor.

27:23.475 --> 27:28.247
And they're--
they're all fine words

27:28.280 --> 27:32.752
until it's their neck
on the block.

27:32.785 --> 27:36.322
No matter what promises
were made...

27:36.355 --> 27:39.726
*

27:39.726 --> 27:43.362
This isn't right.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.932
And I got to tell you,
Lauren...

27:49.501 --> 27:54.040
If you're in prison,

27:54.073 --> 27:58.244
they'll just see her
as a loose end.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.246
She'll never be safe.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.287
- Tafani.

28:08.320 --> 28:16.328
*

28:17.663 --> 28:20.666
- Carlo Tafani?

28:21.901 --> 28:26.138
- Victoria was sleeping
with him.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.208
I told her never get into bed
with the boss.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.210

28:31.243 --> 28:33.780
- You sure about this?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.614
- Yes, sir.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.786
- Carlo Tafani.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.554
He's a boss for
the Outfit's Bridgeport crew.

28:42.588 --> 28:43.823
Tied to money laundering,

28:43.856 --> 28:46.025

in the disappearance

28:46.058 --> 28:48.527
of several witnesses
in the family secrets case.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.163
- Financial Crimes
just sent over a report

28:51.197 --> 28:54.433
detailing recent transactions
by Tafani's front company,

28:54.466 --> 28:55.802
Vesta Inc.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.669
Now, one of the names
that showed up on the report

28:57.703 --> 28:59.906
is none other
than Miss Lana Del Rio.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.141
- Well, that's one of those
aliases that Victoria used.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.242
- Exactly.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.911
Now, the check scam
paid out in cash,

29:04.944 --> 29:07.546
so I'm thinking, you know,
hush money.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.951
- I'll pick him up.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.220
- I'll come with.
- No, you won't.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.222
- You said we'd hit this guy
with everything we got.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.658
- Tafani is not the kind of guy
you punch in the mouth.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.293
- Right now,
he is suspect number one.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.829
- Which is why I'm going
to talk to him.

29:22.829 --> 29:23.996
- Hank.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.397
- Sergeant.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.066
- Sergeant,

29:27.099 --> 29:29.168
if you don't drag Tafani
back here in a set of cuffs,

29:29.201 --> 29:31.037
I will.

29:31.070 --> 29:35.007

is your problem.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.375
You keep talking to me

29:36.408 --> 29:40.412

instead of your boss.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.538
I'm taking you to lockup,

find a reason to put your ass

realize that any connection

30:11.610 --> 30:14.947

Wait, I know I screwed up.

how hard this was for me,

all on Callie.

You were there for my family

30:29.728 --> 30:31.130

and match to her unborn child.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.603
- Well,
save yourself the trouble.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.106
Call my doctor.

34:00.139 --> 34:04.743
I got a vasectomy
five years ago,

34:04.776 --> 34:08.114
and I can prove it.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.681
Now, are we done?

34:09.715 --> 34:11.217
'Cause I'd really like
to go back to my granddaughter,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.451
spend the evening with her.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.121
I only get to see her
once a week.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.355
[knock at door]

34:16.388 --> 34:18.389
Excuse me.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.426
- There's something
you need to see.

34:22.428 --> 34:25.331
So it turns out the only other
person authorized to wire money

34:25.364 --> 34:29.135
out of Tafani's account
is the lawyer, Jim Shelte.

34:29.135 --> 34:32.737
- They need someone
to send the bribe, make bail.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.139
That's what those guys do.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.507
- There's more to it than that.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.609
I had Mouse
run Shelte's financials.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.945
- Get this, if Shelte bills out
600 an hour,

34:39.978 --> 34:41.380
he's still
living beyond his means.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.981
The guy's going
through a nasty divorce.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.516
He's got debt
up to his eyeballs,

34:44.550 --> 34:46.252
a condo, car...

34:46.284 --> 34:48.786
- Boat,
a 55-foot Bertram

34:48.820 --> 34:50.789
he keeps registered
in New Buffalo, Michigan.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.458
- Yeah, It seems he also likes
to live it up

34:52.491 --> 34:53.792
room-service style.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.726
He keeps a standing reservation
at the W Hotel.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.963
Well, he's been crashing there
ever since his wife

34:57.996 --> 35:02.434
kicked him out,
so I accessed security footage

35:02.468 --> 35:03.635
at the hotel.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.003
[types, beeps]

35:06.738 --> 35:09.708
And look who's been visiting him
the last month.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.077
Our D.O.A.

35:12.178 --> 35:15.080
[dramatic music]

35:36.235 --> 35:36.368
.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.004
[knock at door]

35:46.312 --> 35:47.779
- Where's my client?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.448
- Which one?

35:49.481 --> 35:50.616
You've had a busy day.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.718
Maybe we should
assign you a parking space.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.719
- [chuckles]
- We've been over this

35:53.752 --> 35:55.554
from every angle,

35:55.587 --> 35:57.223
and we just can't figure out

35:57.256 --> 36:01.327
why Charlie Koslow
would want to murder Victoria.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.428
[door opens]

36:10.068 --> 36:12.338
- What the hell is this about?

36:12.371 --> 36:14.440
- You're in a lot
of trouble, Counselor.

36:14.473 --> 36:17.042
It looks like you panicked
a little bit

36:17.075 --> 36:18.644
when you found
Victoria was pregnant.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.812
This one's my favorite.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.981
So, you paid her 20 grand
of the boss's money

36:23.014 --> 36:25.784
just to make the problem
go away.

36:25.817 --> 36:29.388
- You didn't want
to keep that baby,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.523
but Victoria wanted to keep it,

36:31.557 --> 36:33.592
so you brought her out
to a remote location,

36:33.625 --> 36:35.327
told her you were going to Cabo.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.695
That's a nice touch.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.298
And then you strangled her,
drilled her full of holes,

36:39.331 --> 36:42.301
little trick you learned
from your mob clients,

36:42.334 --> 36:47.539
and you go out on your Bertram
to dump the body.

36:50.008 --> 36:54.746
- Everything you've got
is circumstantial at best.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.049
- Way I see it,
you got two options:

36:58.083 --> 37:02.721
one, you cop to the murder
right now,

37:02.754 --> 37:06.292
no deal, no assurances,

37:06.325 --> 37:09.795
or two,
walk out that door...

37:11.697 --> 37:15.066
And you know
what's gonna happen.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.570
- Wait a minute.
- What's it gonna be?

37:18.604 --> 37:21.573
[tense music]

37:21.607 --> 37:29.615
*

37:32.217 --> 37:34.152
- I think I'll be going now.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.153
- No way.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.456
- Erin.

37:37.489 --> 37:41.460
- Good luck
with the investigation.

37:41.493 --> 37:48.734
*

37:48.767 --> 37:50.769
- We had him.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.507
[car alarm chirps]

37:55.541 --> 37:58.577
Hey!

37:58.610 --> 38:00.579
This isn't over.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.781
I'm gonna make sure you go down
for Victoria's murder.

38:02.814 --> 38:03.782
- I already told you.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.584
You got your guy in custody
for that.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.219
His name is Charlie Koslow.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.822
- Jimmy, why don't you hop in?

38:12.624 --> 38:13.892
[car alarm chirps]

38:13.925 --> 38:16.895
[dark music]

38:16.928 --> 38:24.936
*

38:42.488 --> 38:44.155
- Hey.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.562
Come on,
I'll walk you out.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.267
- [exhales]

38:57.669 --> 39:00.639
[rock music playing]

39:00.672 --> 39:03.074
*

39:03.108 --> 39:04.109
- Excuse me.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.445
- [laughs softly]

39:06.478 --> 39:07.679
- Can I get a Manhattan?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.214
- Yep.

39:09.247 --> 39:13.284
*

39:13.318 --> 39:15.654
You know, you mentioned
the summer you moved in...

39:18.890 --> 39:23.194
The thing you didn't know
about Tommy Posato,

39:23.228 --> 39:26.998
the thing nobody knew is,

39:27.032 --> 39:31.202
Tommy liked underage girls

39:31.236 --> 39:33.672
and tender-aged girls.

39:35.874 --> 39:36.908
- Here you go, Hank.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.076
- Thanks.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.746
*

39:40.779 --> 39:45.617
The Outfit found out about it,
and they gave him a choice.

39:45.651 --> 39:49.921
.22 to the back of the head

39:49.955 --> 39:52.023
or take the rap
for one of their robberies

39:52.057 --> 39:54.460
and go away to Joliet.

39:54.460 --> 39:58.630
*

39:58.664 --> 40:00.499
Erin...

40:05.637 --> 40:08.173
I'm not always going
to explain what I do,

40:08.206 --> 40:10.341
and you're not always
gonna like me for that,

40:10.375 --> 40:13.378
but...just...

40:14.480 --> 40:15.981
I...

40:17.683 --> 40:20.385
Never forget I love you.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.390
[poignant music]

40:25.423 --> 40:29.861
*

40:29.895 --> 40:31.797
- Callie!

40:31.830 --> 40:32.931
Callie?

40:32.964 --> 40:36.167
- [whimpering]

40:36.201 --> 40:37.469
- Oh, no, are you okay?

40:37.503 --> 40:38.537
- Yeah.
- Callie, what happened?

40:38.570 --> 40:39.738
- Ritchie, Ritchie.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.007
- Ritchie--where is he?
- He went that way.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.475
- Roll an ambulance,
request for backup.

40:43.509 --> 40:44.810
- Hey, Roman,
where are you going?

40:44.843 --> 40:47.112
- Just do it.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.747
- 21-13, squad,
roll an ambulance

40:48.780 --> 40:50.281
to 1932 South Wells.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.584
Here, press.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.753

[suspenseful music]

41:04.129 --> 41:05.864

41:05.897 --> 41:08.567
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

41:08.600 --> 41:16.608
*

41:28.920 --> 41:30.622
- Let me see your hands!

41:30.656 --> 41:31.723
Let me see your hands!

41:31.757 --> 41:32.758
- Roman!

41:32.791 --> 41:34.960
- Over here.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.629
- I heard shots.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.797
- I told him to stop.

41:40.866 --> 41:44.069
- Oh, Sean, he's dead.

41:44.102 --> 41:47.205
- He aimed a gun at me.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.407
- No, I see a phone.
I don't see a gun.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.476
*

41:51.577 --> 41:53.144
Sean, I don't see a gun.

41:53.178 --> 41:56.381
- I swear it was in his hand.

*

42:04.489 --> 42:07.158
[phone buzzing]

42:10.596 --> 42:11.630
- Voight.

- Sergeant,
we have a problem.
