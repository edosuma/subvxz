[music playing]

00:08.008 --> 00:09.910
Okie dokie, who wants what?

00:09.943 --> 00:13.247
[interposing voices]

00:13.281 --> 00:15.283
Yeah, OK, I'll remember
that for next time.

00:15.316 --> 00:19.853
But now, tuna for everyone.

00:19.887 --> 00:23.091
I'm sure if you made it,
Roseanne, it will be delicious.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.292
Cool it, Roger.

00:24.325 --> 00:28.196
Dan doesn't like it when
I'm lied to by other men.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.397
OK, 20 minutes till the movie.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.298
Let's go.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.599
OK, hold on.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.401
Because I want you to wear
my coat with the big pockets

00:33.434 --> 00:35.969
so we can sneak
in our own drinks.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.538
Why don't you wear it?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.874
Oh, they're on to me.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.577
I'll be right back.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.514
Well, isn't anyone
going to introduce me?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.415
I'm sorry.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.382
Nancy, the real world.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.619
The real world, Nancy.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.788
Nancy, this is Roger,
a good buddy of mine.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.357
My pleasure.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.359
Wait a minute, that accent.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.129
You're not from
Lanford, are you?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.029
No it's true.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.164
I'm not from Lanford.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.899
But as a small boy in
London, I dreamed of one

01:05.933 --> 01:08.436
day seeing its sunny shores.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.905
You know, I tried an accent
once but it didn't work for me.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.576
People kept asking if I
was wearing a retainer.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.845
I think you've
got a lovely voice.

01:17.878 --> 01:18.679
Thank you.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.552
Well, she's interesting.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.722
More interesting
than you know.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.124
Yeah, listen, I don't
think you're going

01:30.158 --> 01:31.959
to get anywhere with Nancy.

01:31.992 --> 01:32.860
You see, she's--

01:32.893 --> 01:33.761
Guys, guys, guys.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.296
Not in front of the kid.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.497
Right.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.698
Let's play cards.
- Yeah.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.032
Sounds good.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.001
Dan, have you thought about
going in on that real estate

01:41.034 --> 01:42.336
deal with me and Raj?

01:42.370 --> 01:43.971
Yeah, it sounds good but
there's no way I could do it.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.606
Oh, everybody has
that doubtful little

01:45.639 --> 01:47.275
voice inside their
head but sometimes

01:47.308 --> 01:49.210
you just got to ignore it.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.011
Well, my little
voice is extremely loud

01:51.044 --> 01:54.114
and can deny me sex.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.717
Come on, Dan.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.519
I'm sure your wife
can be persuaded.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.388
Have you tried talking to her?

02:00.421 --> 02:02.523
I tried, but her
hair was full of snakes

02:02.556 --> 02:06.026
and just seemed like a bad time.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.561
They're taking forever.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.697
Entertain me.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.131
Gladly.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.933
All right, I'm in for $0.50.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.902
I'll raise you $0.50.

02:14.935 --> 02:15.936
I'm out.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.806
I'll see that $0.50
and raise you $1.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.774
I think I should let
you know I have no qualms

02:20.808 --> 02:22.843
about taking money from a girl.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.545
What about from a woman?

02:24.578 --> 02:25.713
How about from a little boy?

02:28.982 --> 02:31.252
I'll see that
and raise you $1.

02:31.285 --> 02:34.355
Raise you $2.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.524
Raise you $5.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.593
Got any more money?

02:39.627 --> 02:41.262
Yeah, I need--

02:41.295 --> 02:42.095
Raise.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.101
Take it.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.037
Yes, I won with
a pair of fours.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.243
Very impressive.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.378
You, me and lady luck
should take a little trip

02:57.411 --> 02:58.946
to Vegas sometime.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.248
And he could hold the camera.

03:04.985 --> 03:05.886
OK, Nancy.

03:05.919 --> 03:06.987
We're all here.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.056
You're not going.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.524
She takes my money.

03:10.558 --> 03:14.262
And you, Roseanne,
take my heart.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.330
Up in the trophy case, honey.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.365
We got another heart.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.570
Stay foreign, it
really works for you.

03:26.974 --> 03:30.611
That Nancy reminds me
of my first girlfriend.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.380
Maybe you should
introduce them.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.687
I don't know, Roger, I
don't think you're her type.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.122
Guys, please.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.759
And what kind of
guy does she go for?

03:45.793 --> 03:46.827
The kind that wears a bra.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.695
She's into chicks.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.234
Do you have the cards?

03:54.268 --> 03:58.639
[theme music]

04:45.753 --> 04:47.521
Well, you know, it
doesn't matter what I like.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.156
It's your prom.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.725
You know, I think I
really like the yellow.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.560
You do?

04:55.596 --> 04:56.897
The blue?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.232
It's all right.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.634
The pink?

05:00.668 --> 05:01.535
Oh, yeah.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.804
The pink.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.038
I didn't say I wanted to go.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.375
I just said it might
be interesting.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.776
The only way I'm
going to the prom

05:08.809 --> 05:11.078
is if I can sit in the rafters
with a bucket of pig's blood.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.984
I got to get going.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.152
Darlene, you know, I really
hope that you change your mind

05:19.186 --> 05:21.655
because, well, you can't
be voted prom queen

05:21.689 --> 05:23.557
unless you're at the prom.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.394
You're not helping, Charlotte.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.895
I'm sorry, it's just
that I'm so excited.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.436
Darlene, please.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.804
Just think about it.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.938
Listen, David.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.875
Let me tell you something
about girls here.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.678
If you really want Darlene
to go to the prom with you,

05:44.712 --> 05:46.614
then go over there
and ask her properly.

05:49.149 --> 05:49.950
All right.

05:52.986 --> 05:57.558
Darlene, will you please
go to the prom with me?

05:57.591 --> 06:04.765
[laughing]

06:04.798 --> 06:07.167
Forget about it.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.469
What's his problem?

06:08.502 --> 06:13.807
Oh well, Darlene, this
may be hard for us women

06:13.841 --> 06:14.775
to understand.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.645
But sometimes a
guy he needs to get

06:17.678 --> 06:19.780
all gussied up and
go out on the town

06:19.813 --> 06:22.683
so he can show off his new hat.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.784
Yeah, well I'm not going.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.886
It's against
everything I stand for.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.588
Well, you know, it's
not just for David.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.691
I mean, before I die I would
like to see one of my kids

06:30.724 --> 06:32.092
go out that door
in a prom dress.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.696
And if it's not you, DJ's
going to be real unhappy.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.599
I got better stuff
to do with my time.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.168
I'll let you
stay out till 2:00.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.035
You got to be kidding.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.577
Make it 6:00 and we'll talk.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.944
3:00.

06:50.978 --> 06:54.214
But you gotta wear a dress and
let me take a picture of you

06:54.247 --> 06:56.049
in front of the fireplace
and then parade you around

06:56.083 --> 06:59.687
in front of the neighbors.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.754
4:00 o'clock.

07:00.788 --> 07:01.655
Dress.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.590
One picture.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.525
No parade.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.728
3:30, picture on fridge, deal?

07:07.761 --> 07:08.629
Deal.

07:08.662 --> 07:12.700
But I keep the negative.

[music playing]

08:31.144 --> 08:33.080
See, this isn't so bad.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.415
Do you want to stay for
the rest of prom night?

08:35.448 --> 08:38.819
Well, since it means so
much to you, we could stay.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.188
Thank you.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.255
I wanted to surprise you.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.791
I rented a motel room.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.793
I wanted tonight
to be the night.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.060
But you know, this is cool, too.

08:56.003 --> 08:59.840
[music playing]

09:01.008 --> 09:04.678
Oh Miss Conner, your
prom date is here.

09:04.712 --> 09:10.417
Oh, don't hate me
because I'm beautiful.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.654
Oh man, you dress like
that in front of the fridge

09:13.687 --> 09:17.190
I'd have died and
gone to heaven.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.425
Hi, I'm here.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.060
My butt's too big
for this dress.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.394
Oh, you look great.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.696
Doesn't she, Dan?

09:22.730 --> 09:24.932
Dress and butt
in perfect harmony.

09:24.965 --> 09:25.833
Thanks.

09:25.866 --> 09:26.967
I'm just not sure about this.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.936
Does Roger know I'm coming?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.504
No, it's not like you're going
to be his date or anything.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.507
It's just a whole bunch of us
putting on our formal attire

09:34.541 --> 09:36.710
and going out to, like,
celebrate our own prom,

09:36.744 --> 09:39.747
except for this time
we're really, really old.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.649
I'm just not sure
I'm ready for it.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.985
Well, we just want an even a
number of boys and girls, OK?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.186
And Roger's really cool.

09:46.219 --> 09:51.659
He's really nice and plus,
he sounds like Ringo.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.862
And who likes Ringo?

09:54.895 --> 09:56.529
I like Ringo.

09:56.563 --> 10:01.101
Roseanne, Jackie,
look who's here.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.671
Oh, Roger brought a date.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.939
And Roger's date is Nancy.

10:08.541 --> 10:12.780
Nancy and Roger are dating.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.347
I hope you don't
mind the tag along.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.583
Happy prom, everyone.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.421
All I know is, heaven must
be missing an angel tonight.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.524
Spread it on thick, baby.

10:24.557 --> 10:28.595
How come you never say
anything neato like that?

10:28.628 --> 10:32.432
Baby, somebody whipped up
on you with a pretty stick.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.407
Ah, shut up.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.510
Hey, Jackie, I didn't know
you were coming with us.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.477
I'm not.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.814
I just came over
to do my laundry.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.950
Everything else was dirty.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.518
God, I'm so sorry.

10:51.551 --> 10:52.820
Come on, you still go with us.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.754
No, actually it's good.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.723
I'm really not ready
for dating yet.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.291
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.560
OK, well I'm glad
you're OK because I mean,

11:00.593 --> 11:05.632
I've got to find out how come
Nancy is going back to men.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.102
Nancy, Ann Marie, little
hen party in the kitchen.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.343
So Nancy, what's going on?

11:16.376 --> 11:19.713
I thought you were
our little gay friend.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.981
So?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.550
So, can't you get kicked
out of the club for this?

11:23.583 --> 11:24.517
What?

11:24.551 --> 11:27.054
He's a nice guy
and he worships me.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.857
Yeah, but you know,
he's an outy not inny.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.799
You just don't
get how it works.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.868
Please don't label me.

11:40.901 --> 11:41.935
I am a people person.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.908
God, now I'm losing
men to lesbians.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.515
Champagne, ladies.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.317
Thank god you're back.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.921
For the last 45 seconds
my life lost all meaning.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.790
What are we celebrating?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.257
I sold a house today.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.458
Made a small fortune.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.361
Dinner's on me.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.462
That's great.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.364
I really wish you'd
reconsider letting Dan

12:11.398 --> 12:13.466
in on this deal with
us, Roseanne, then

12:13.500 --> 12:16.069
we'd be toasting more often.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.137
What deal?

12:17.170 --> 12:19.539
Trust me, Rosie,
it's not for us.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.041
I want to know.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.145
Well, all right.

12:25.178 --> 12:29.449
We buy rundown houses cheap,
fix them up ourselves,

12:29.482 --> 12:32.820
and then sell them before the
mortgage and taxes are due.

12:32.853 --> 12:37.190
Next time, Dan's name
could be on this check.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.259
Oh man, how come you
didn't tell me about this?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.661
This is perfect for you.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.263
Because I knew you'd say no.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.364
Oh, right.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.200
So now you know what
I'm always going to say.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.802
Oh hey, I take $5,000.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.103
I put it into this
and I lose it,

12:50.137 --> 12:51.204
and you're not going to be mad?

12:51.238 --> 12:52.505
No.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.041
Not if it's something that
you really want to do, Dan.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.076
I mean, all you're moping
around and whining how you want

12:56.109 --> 12:58.645
to do something special, now
something great like this

12:58.678 --> 13:01.748
comes along and you say
no without even asking me.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.216
Come on, guys.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.284
Give peace a chance.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.556
Roseanne, I can turn
this down if I want to.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.691
Fine, you can turn it down.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.393
But don't be blaming
me like, you know,

13:13.426 --> 13:14.594
I won't let you do nothing.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.364
Making everybody think
that your shrew of a wife

13:17.397 --> 13:19.399
is telling you what
to do all the time.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.169
On the count of three
we go for the door.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.004
I'm sorry I made
everybody in the room

13:24.037 --> 13:25.372
think that you're
a shrew, Roseanne.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.375
Good thing you were here
to clear your good name.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.943
Oh, they're not
thinking that I'm a shrew.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.845
They're thinking
that you're an idiot.

13:31.879 --> 13:35.883
They think I'm an idiot
for marrying a shrew.

13:35.916 --> 13:40.921
Oh, isn't that just like you,
starting a big fight on a night

13:40.954 --> 13:45.092
when somebody else is
going to pay for dinner.

13:45.125 --> 13:49.997
[music playing]

13:59.572 --> 14:00.373
Still?

14:06.479 --> 14:11.118
I just can't believe
this is happening.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.053
I'm ready all the time.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.055
I'm ready in school.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.991
I'm ready at the dinner table.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.161
Why can't I be ready
in a motel room?

14:21.194 --> 14:24.131
Don't ask me.
I never done this before.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.700
Well, neither have I. Maybe
if you just stop pushing me

14:27.734 --> 14:30.537
it would happen by itself.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.373
What do you mean, pushing you?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.475
Well, Darlene, you
just sprang this on me.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.311
I thought we were just
going to the prom.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.512
You mean, you
weren't going to try

14:39.546 --> 14:41.281
to have sex with me tonight?

14:41.314 --> 14:42.482
Yes, I was.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.651
But then I would have been
the one who started it.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.154
OK fine, you can start it.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.855
I'll just lie here and watch TV.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.592
And then when you're ready,
come on over and start.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.295
OK.

15:31.164 --> 15:31.965
Damn it.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.471
Now my arms and legs
are starting to go numb.

15:43.876 --> 15:44.944
I'm sorry, David.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.880
I know how much you
wanted this to happen.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.549
Darlene, just
please stop talking.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.884
You say anything else, I
might disappear altogether.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.924
How do you think
this makes me feel.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.761
I'm the only thing in the
world that doesn't turn you on.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.696
Oh come on, you
know that's not it.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.467
Well, I don't get it.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.568
I mean, I know
you want to do it.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.870
Maybe you just don't
want to do it with me.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.173
No, no, no.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.975
I'm just-- I'm really scared.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.916
I just always figured
that when we did do it,

16:23.950 --> 16:26.186
that you really wouldn't
want to and that you'd

16:26.219 --> 16:28.455
just be doing it for me.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.023
So then I wouldn't
have to be good.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.128
Well, I just wanted
to be with you.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.563
I never expected you to be good.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.972
I just can't see
how this is happening.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.574
My mom probably put
something in the food.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.987
[music playing]

17:19.005 --> 17:20.840
Whoa, scoring
on the first try.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.851
Is that some sort of
slam about last night?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.354
No, I totally forgot
about last night.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.389
It's like it never happened.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.324
Oh, that's it.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.759
This conversation is over.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.060
Hey, how was the prom?

17:41.094 --> 17:42.529
Was it everything you expected?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.097
Not exactly.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.232
Where did you go after?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.133
Did you go out--

17:46.166 --> 17:47.534
We went out driving.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.701
All night?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.270
Well, let's see.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.405
The prom ended at about 12:15.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.474
And from there we
went over to Sharna's.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.244
And we were there from
about 12:30 until 2:00.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.679
And then from there we
went to this other party

17:59.712 --> 18:02.882
over at Sudarat's, and we
were there till like 3:00.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.251
And then we just had
to take people home.

18:04.284 --> 18:08.054
So we didn't get back here
till about five of 4:00.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.523
Wow, you did
have a busy night.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.593
Well, it's 3:00 PM.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.727
I'm going in the other room.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.529
I should be there about 3:01.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.941
Hey, did you talk to
Darlene about the prom?

18:28.975 --> 18:31.211
No, what was the death count?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.579
They got in really late.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.813
And I was talking to them.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.482
And they had some pretty
quick answers about where

18:35.515 --> 18:36.483
they'd been, and when.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.917
And it was prom night.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.587
And I got to thinking about
when you and I were kids.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.389
And I think they had sex.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.460
OK.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.296
Now, don't go crazy, Roseanne.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.097
Just stay calm and
we can work it out.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.432
What's there to work out?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.633
They had sex.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.535
Well, great, Darlene
is a woman now.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.436
Good.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.405
Maybe she can do
her own laundry.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.906
Don't you want to talk
to Darlene about it?

18:59.939 --> 19:00.907
No, Jackie.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.475
I don't even want
to know about it.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.076
Millions of people's
kids have sex every day

19:04.110 --> 19:05.044
and they don't know about it.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.613
How come I have
to know about it?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.449
No, I mean, how come I
have to know about it?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.783
How come my kids
always make sure

19:10.817 --> 19:13.052
I find out every
damn thing they do?

19:13.085 --> 19:15.455
I want to be in
the dark, Jackie.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.958
I want to walk around with
a great big stupid smile

19:18.991 --> 19:20.727
on my face like
everybody else's parents

19:20.760 --> 19:21.828
in the whole damn world.

19:21.861 --> 19:22.995
Well, maybe they didn't do it.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.597
Oh, they did it.

19:24.631 --> 19:28.067
Of course they did.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.869
And you're OK with that?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.003
No.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.772
But what am I supposed to do?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.974
I gave her the birth
control speech.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.945
She's seen the, how a
condom works, puppet show.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.648
David's a good kid and he
really cares about her.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.182
And at least he washes.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.818
I know that because
I do his towels.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.554
I can't believe how
well you're taking it.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.821
Oh yeah.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.056
Oh yeah.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.058
Yeah, as soon as DJ's
old enough to do it, him

19:52.091 --> 19:53.893
and his girlfriend,
they will be doing it

19:53.926 --> 19:55.428
right there on the
other end of the couch

19:55.462 --> 19:57.797
while I'm sitting on the
other end just watching TV

19:57.830 --> 19:59.131
and I won't even
notice a damn thing.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.078
Hey.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.212
I've been to the store.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.615
I've purchased ice
cream and beer.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.983
Oh perfect, we
can make floats.

20:19.786 --> 20:23.189
So, are we making up now?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.258
No, we're celebrating.

20:25.292 --> 20:30.797
I went to visit
Roger, put in $5,000.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.500
Where did you get $5,000?

20:33.533 --> 20:37.036
You finally took all the
empty pop bottles back.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.137
Nope.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.573
Lumber yard gave me
$5,000 worth of credit.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.510

owner of a depressed property.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.411
Wow.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.312
Great.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.348
Now we got a set.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.049
I'm kind of nervous
about this, honey.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.751
I hope you're making
me do the right thing.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.089
I really, think
it's going to be good.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.225
Yeah, me too.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.193
So, what else been
going on around here?

21:01.227 --> 21:02.028
I miss anything?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.334
Nope.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.801
Same old, same old.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.415
DAVID: Darlene, I really
appreciate you being so

21:22.449 --> 21:23.983
understanding about last time.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.586
DARLENE: It's OK,
David, I love you.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.187
DAVID: I love you too.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.056
DARLENE: So are we
ready to have sex?
