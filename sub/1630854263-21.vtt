WEBVTT

00:06.900 --> 00:09.220
Oh, hey, Tina.
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

00:09.420 --> 00:10.490
It's coffee with
the principal day,

00:10.690 --> 00:11.990
and I have to stop
at Starbucks

00:12.190 --> 00:13.360
because school coffee
is straight trash.
Ugh.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.230
Look, r-real quick.
Feel this.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.400
Whoa, that's
a lot of cash.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.800
Why do you
have all that?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.900
If it's illegal,
don't tell me, Tina.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.520
I'm a snitch.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.740
It's advanced ticket sales
for our school musical.

00:27.940 --> 00:31.540
Word must have gotten around
that the director's a genius.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.910
Oh, okay, so you're
a genius now?

00:35.110 --> 00:36.380
Follow the money, mama.

00:36.580 --> 00:38.770
Follow the money.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.020
Oh, have a good day, baby.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.290
Oh.
Mwah.

00:43.490 --> 00:45.840
Hoping to beat traffic.
Okay.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.560
Oh, hey, Calvin. I know
what you're wondering,

00:49.760 --> 00:51.030
and the, uh, the answer is no.

00:51.230 --> 00:52.800
What was I wondering?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.930
Oh, well, you were wondering
if my dad has reached out to me

00:55.130 --> 00:57.940
since I accepted
his friend request one week ago.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.000
He has not.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.170
Oh, well, sorry to hear that.

01:01.370 --> 01:02.380
Hey, it's his loss.

01:02.580 --> 01:04.730
Yeah. (sighs)
You know...

01:05.930 --> 01:07.250
...hadn't thought
about him for years,

01:07.450 --> 01:09.450
but then Grover
found his picture online

01:09.650 --> 01:12.550
and memories
just came flooding back.

01:12.750 --> 01:16.000
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.
Okay, got to go.

01:16.970 --> 01:18.820
You know, every time
I pass a Pizza Hut,

01:19.020 --> 01:21.160
I remember he used to take
me there every Friday

01:21.360 --> 01:22.760
after Little League.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.430
Yeah, I would
go to the salad bar

01:24.630 --> 01:26.500
and fill my pockets
with croutons.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.000
I literally would have
ants in my pants.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.140
Hey, you got to remember
the good times.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.110
Okay, now, talk to you later.

01:34.310 --> 01:37.560
And then one Friday, the Hut
introduced stuffed crust.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.060
I'm so jazzed to
try it with my dad.

01:43.030 --> 01:45.100
That was the Friday
that he disappeared.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.370
Just felt lost ever since.

01:49.140 --> 01:51.860
All right.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.660
Tell me more.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.830
Well, there was a time
I had testicular torsion.

01:57.030 --> 01:59.030
I had no one
to talk to about that.

01:59.230 --> 02:01.870
And you still don't.

02:02.070 --> 02:05.700
Okay, how about we, uh, skip
to the part of your life

02:05.900 --> 02:09.380
where you are
a father and a husband?

02:09.580 --> 02:11.240
You know, like,
if you saw your dad today,

02:11.440 --> 02:12.900
what would you say to him?

02:14.100 --> 02:16.320
(sighs) I don't know.
I guess I...

02:16.520 --> 02:19.120
Guess I would say, uh,

02:19.320 --> 02:21.120
"Hey, Lamar.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.720
"It's great to see you again.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.620
Thanks for abandoning me."
And then face punch!

02:25.820 --> 02:28.230
Okay. All right.
You know what, Dave?

02:28.430 --> 02:31.560
Maybe it's a good thing
he hasn't responded to you.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.370
Yeah, well, maybe it's a good
thing that I haven't responded

02:33.570 --> 02:35.580
to him.
Face punch again.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.490
God, just thinking
about him makes me angry A.H.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.580
You know what? I'm just
gonna go ahead and say it.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.040
Angry as heck!

02:46.250 --> 02:48.060
(door closes)
Oh, damn.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.750
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

02:50.950 --> 02:52.500
* Welcome to the hood. *

02:57.270 --> 02:59.930
Dad? You haven't left yet?

03:00.130 --> 03:03.550
I tried, but I got Dave'd.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.430
Yeah, well, I've been there,

03:06.630 --> 03:08.470
but we need to head over
to the Fuse Box.

03:08.670 --> 03:10.500
Some of the people we hired
don't actually do anything

03:10.700 --> 03:11.540
until I get there.

03:11.740 --> 03:12.740
Look, son, you're gonna have to

03:12.940 --> 03:14.440
light a fire under their asses.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.840
That's your job now.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.530
Management is more than
having a parking spot.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.750
You have a parking spot?

03:21.950 --> 03:23.670
I'm paying $20
to park at the bank.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.340
Hey.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.620
Excuse me. I'm looking

03:30.820 --> 03:32.990
for 1172 Evergreen Drive.

03:33.190 --> 03:34.390
Uh, yeah, that's next door.

03:34.590 --> 03:38.210
Oh, then you must know
my son, David Johnson.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.380
Oh, damn.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.700
You're Lamar?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.400
I am he, and he is I,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.470
and both of me
is delighted to meet you.

03:46.670 --> 03:48.040
(laughs)

03:48.240 --> 03:50.380
Yeah, you are definitely
Dave's daddy.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.840
(laughs)

03:52.040 --> 03:53.610
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just gonna pop in on my son.

03:53.810 --> 03:57.020
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. I mean, what's the rush?

03:57.220 --> 03:59.150
I mean, you've been
gone for 30 years,

03:59.350 --> 04:01.950
what's 30 more minutes?
I think we should talk.

04:02.150 --> 04:04.670
* *

04:06.510 --> 04:09.560
Okay, we're gonna need lots
of spare parts, so I'm gonna

04:09.760 --> 04:12.930
need you guys to hit up
car auctions, salvage yards.

04:13.130 --> 04:15.670
Uh... Oh, Reynard,

04:15.870 --> 04:16.900
you know we started at 10:00.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.700
Yeah, sorry,
my girlfriend's cat.

04:18.900 --> 04:21.640
Oh, no, I-I'm sorry.
Did-did the cat die?

04:21.840 --> 04:23.710
Oh, no, she just has a cat.

04:23.910 --> 04:25.330
You know how it is.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.550
Uh, no, I-I don't. Uh, anyway,

04:29.750 --> 04:31.150
as I was saying,
I've compiled a list

04:31.350 --> 04:32.990
of E.V. parts and
models that we need.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.090
We need motherboards
touch screens,

04:35.290 --> 04:37.090
batteries... Oh, uh,
uh, uh, Reynard.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.620
Uh, R-Reynard,
what are you doing, man?

04:38.820 --> 04:40.860
Oh, my phone's
at one percent, bro.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.760
You can't just unplug things.

04:42.960 --> 04:46.060
I-I was updating our servers.
Now I got to restart the update.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.570
Here. Hey, let's just take ten.

04:47.770 --> 04:49.790
(scoffs) Ten's a
pretty short break.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.520
You just got here.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.050
Hey, lil' bro. I came to
take you out to lunch, but, uh,

05:00.250 --> 05:01.950
looks like you got
your hands full.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.150
That guy sucks.

05:03.350 --> 05:06.320
Yeah, Reynard.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.520
You know, he was great
when we worked together at JPL.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.590
We used to always
screw around together

05:10.790 --> 05:11.820
and make fun of the boss.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.340
But now that I am the boss,
that guy sucks.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.100
Daddy's gonna have to fire him.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.330
Uh, wait, why can't you do it?

05:20.530 --> 05:22.740
You know I'm not
good at confrontation.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.640
I sign every petition
outside of Trader Joe's,

05:24.840 --> 05:25.850
no matter what they're for.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.490
Dad always knocks the clipboards
out of their hand.

05:30.590 --> 05:31.980
Well, Marty, you
keep telling Pop

05:32.180 --> 05:33.710
you want to be treated
like a full partner, right?

05:33.910 --> 05:36.530
Well, drop the hammer
down on that dude.

05:37.770 --> 05:38.700
Go on, now.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.960
And I-I've got to ask,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.290
what were your parents thinking

05:47.490 --> 05:49.230
when they named you Lamar?
Mm.

05:49.430 --> 05:52.160
It's actually a combination
of my parents' names.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.200
Oh.
Oh.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.630
Well, that makes sense.

05:54.830 --> 05:57.350
Latasha and Marcellus.

06:01.190 --> 06:02.780
Of course.

06:02.980 --> 06:04.780
(both chuckle)

06:04.980 --> 06:06.750
Lamar, I got to be
straight with you.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.080
Your son and I are good friends.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.630
Best friends?

06:10.530 --> 06:12.020
He would say that, yes.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.820
And that's why

06:14.020 --> 06:15.220
I wanted to talk to you before

06:15.420 --> 06:17.760
I took you over to see Dave.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.230
He's got complicated
feelings about you.

06:20.430 --> 06:21.790
I-I'm sure you can
understand why.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.430
I get it. I've been out
of his life for years.

06:24.630 --> 06:25.730
When I heard from him,

06:25.930 --> 06:27.230
I couldn't find the words
to write back,

06:27.430 --> 06:29.970
so I just hopped on a bus
and here I am.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.100
(knocking)
Hey, Calvin,

06:32.300 --> 06:33.840
I got your text.
What's the emergency?

06:34.040 --> 06:35.940
Oh, hi. Who's this?
Oh, my God, you're Lamar.

06:36.140 --> 06:37.980
Are you Lamar? You're Lamar.
Dave's gonna freak out.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.480
Don't let him see him. Oh, wait,

06:39.680 --> 06:40.810
that's why you brought him
over here. I'm sorry.

06:41.010 --> 06:42.430
I've had so much coffee
this morning.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.170
You must be Gemma.

06:47.370 --> 06:48.850
Actually, it's Gemma
with a "juh."

06:49.050 --> 06:52.960
Well, you're as beautiful
as you are caffeinated.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.430
Thank you.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.930
Uh, Tina, Gemma, let me talk
to you guys for a second.

06:58.130 --> 06:59.870
Oh. Oh, okay. Excuse us.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.630
(chuckles)
Excuse. Yeah.

07:01.830 --> 07:02.500
Look, uh,

07:02.700 --> 07:04.170
Gemma, this is your call,

07:04.370 --> 07:06.510
but should we take him
to meet Dave?

07:06.710 --> 07:10.480
Oh, God. I mean,
he is Dave's father.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.410
Hi. Sorry.
(others gasp)

07:12.610 --> 07:15.200
But I'd love
to go see my son now.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.470
Yeah. Come on. Yeah, let's go.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.120
Uh, Reynard, can we talk?

07:26.320 --> 07:29.440
Sure. I'm doing
literally nothing.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.600
Uh...

07:32.800 --> 07:34.270
Look, man... (sighs)
Hm?

07:34.470 --> 07:37.270
I'm concerned that your talents

07:37.470 --> 07:39.300
are being underused
here at the Fuse Box.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.110
Clearly, you're capable
of much more, and

07:42.310 --> 07:43.480
I think
we need to make a change.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.210
I've been feeling
the same way.

07:45.410 --> 07:46.780
You have?
Oh, good.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.850
You know, sometimes,
a-a job's requirements

07:49.050 --> 07:51.050
and applicant skills
just don't sync up, you know?

07:51.250 --> 07:53.120
It's nobody's fault.
Agreed.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.050
Yeah. Well,
I'm glad we talked.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.020
You know, goodbye
and, you know, uh,

07:57.220 --> 07:58.420
good luck with that cat.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.230
Thanks for the pep talk.
All right. (chuckles)

08:01.430 --> 08:04.010
I'll see you at lunch.
What the...

08:06.050 --> 08:07.780
Hi, honey.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.200
Hey, buddy.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.310
You okay?
Yeah.

08:13.510 --> 08:16.840
Okay, um, why-why don't you
put down the box?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.110
Just recycling.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.510
Hey, you know
if they take these?

08:20.710 --> 08:21.510
Whoa!

08:21.710 --> 08:23.220
Whoa.
Okay, uh, okay,

08:23.420 --> 08:24.650
Dave, w-why don't you
have a seat?

08:24.850 --> 08:26.150
We have something
we want to tell you.

08:26.350 --> 08:27.590
And we don't want you
to get upset.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.270
Stop it.

08:31.370 --> 08:32.360
Look, Dave,

08:32.560 --> 08:34.230
someone's here
to see you. Now,

08:34.430 --> 08:36.190
you may think it's a bad thing,

08:36.390 --> 08:38.750
but we are hoping
it's a good thing.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.850
Come on in.

08:45.950 --> 08:48.990
David. Son.

08:52.760 --> 08:53.750
Lamar?

08:53.950 --> 08:55.350
I want you to know

08:55.550 --> 08:58.830
that I'm so, so sorry.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.540
Okay, D-Dave, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't want to do this. Dave!

09:05.110 --> 09:06.160
Oh.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.060
Okay.

09:08.260 --> 09:10.580
All right. Well, or that.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.970
Do you remember that time
I took you to the movies

09:20.170 --> 09:22.940
to see <i>Fern Gully:</i>
<i>The Last Rainforest,</i>

09:23.140 --> 09:24.340
but we went
into the wrong theater?

09:24.540 --> 09:26.140
It was <i>Basic Instinct.</i>
(laughs)

09:26.340 --> 09:29.500
I can't believe it took us
an hour to figure that out.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.820
Oh, your mom was so mad.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.720
Yeah, mom was mad.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.650
Mom was mad a lot back then.

09:35.850 --> 09:38.560
E-Especially when you left
and never came home again.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.460
Ooh.

09:40.660 --> 09:43.330
That turned fast.

09:43.530 --> 09:46.900
You know, I was really mad, too.
I still am.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.270
And I certainly
owe you an explanation.

09:50.470 --> 09:51.370
Yeah, you do.

09:51.570 --> 09:53.640
He's been very upset
for a long time.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.970
And that's understandable.

09:55.170 --> 09:56.110
The truth is,

09:56.310 --> 09:58.010
being absent wasn't my choice.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.710
It was the choice
of a jury of my peers.

10:00.910 --> 10:03.100
Oh, damn.
Oh, damn.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.650
Wait,

10:06.850 --> 10:07.950
were you in prison?

10:08.150 --> 10:11.640
Well... yes.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.890
Was it a violent crime?

10:16.090 --> 10:18.330
Because if it was,
my friend Calvin

10:18.530 --> 10:20.350
is gonna take you
right out of here.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.100
No.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.900
No, no, no, I'm not a monster.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.450
Yeah, and-and I'm not
a bouncer, Dave.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.640
I stole some money,
but it was a victimless crime.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.110
I took a bunch of money
from some rich people.

10:32.310 --> 10:33.950
I was like Robin Hood,

10:34.150 --> 10:36.310
legendary hero
of the common folk.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.720
Who'd you give
the money to?

10:37.920 --> 10:39.100
Oh, I kept it.

10:40.370 --> 10:43.310
I was not exactly
like Robin Hood.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.420
Dave, I so wanted
to tell you,

10:46.620 --> 10:48.330
but I didn't want you
to live with the stigma.

10:48.530 --> 10:52.060
Your mother agreed.
Oh, boy, did she agree.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.970
But the hardest thing
about prison

10:54.170 --> 10:55.970
was not being able
to see my son.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.370
What about when you got out?

10:58.570 --> 10:59.600
I was a loser.

10:59.810 --> 11:02.010
I was embarrassed.

11:02.210 --> 11:03.710
Then I pulled myself together

11:03.910 --> 11:05.680
and I worked up the courage
to send you the friend request.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.510
I'd seen pictures of you
and your family on Facebook.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.080
So happy.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.520
So, I've been waiting,

11:11.720 --> 11:14.440
hoping we can have
some kind of relationship.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.790
Well...

11:19.990 --> 11:22.610
face punch seems
a lot less likely now.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.410
Was face punch on the table?

11:27.550 --> 11:29.570
(laughs) Oh, yeah,
it was a face punch
Oh.

11:29.770 --> 11:33.120
and a nut kick and something
to do with jazz hands.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.150
I don't know how Reynard didn't
understand I was firing him.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.180
I told him he was being
underused at the Fuse Box,

11:42.380 --> 11:43.520
that it wasn't a good
match for his skills

11:43.720 --> 11:45.850
and that he'd be
much happier elsewhere.

11:46.050 --> 11:47.590
Well, that's
pretty much perfect.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.140
The only thing you left out
was "you're fired."

11:52.540 --> 11:55.390
It was implied.
It was really, really implied.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.860
(laughs)

11:57.060 --> 11:59.630
Look, it doesn't matter
how implied it was, Marty.

11:59.830 --> 12:01.330
People are gonna hear
what they want to hear.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.570
You know, if you
said that to me,

12:02.770 --> 12:04.650
I would just say,
"Thanks, man."

12:05.850 --> 12:07.470
He just said, "Thanks,
man," didn't he?

12:07.670 --> 12:09.170
Yeah.

12:09.370 --> 12:11.180
Look, bro, as a coach,

12:11.380 --> 12:13.350
sometimes I have to
give players bad news.

12:13.550 --> 12:16.610
The thing I've learned is
it is best to be direct.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.750
Well, it seems mean.

12:17.950 --> 12:19.220
You are damn
right it's mean,

12:19.420 --> 12:21.550
but it is nicer
in the long run.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.260
Okay. Help me.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.560
Teach me your blunt
and brutal ways.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.130
(sighs)

12:28.330 --> 12:30.000
Okay. (clears throat)
I'll be you,

12:30.200 --> 12:31.530
you'll be Reynard.
All right.

12:31.730 --> 12:32.660
Yeah? Sit down.

12:32.870 --> 12:34.370
Don't sit down.
You're fired.

12:34.570 --> 12:36.250
(gasps)

12:40.720 --> 12:41.810
Tina.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.740
I don't mean to
toot our own horns,

12:43.940 --> 12:44.840
but we did
a good thing

12:45.040 --> 12:46.510
for Dave today.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.580
Calvin, quick question,
by any chance,

12:48.780 --> 12:50.280
did you see an envelope
full of cash

12:50.480 --> 12:51.920
that I left on the counter?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.320
Uh, no. Why?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.950
Ugh. It's gone.
It's the school's money.

12:56.150 --> 12:59.660
And I left it here so I wouldn't
forget to move it into the safe,

12:59.860 --> 13:01.690
but I forgot.

13:01.890 --> 13:04.830
I think you're missing
the point of a safe. (laughs)

13:05.030 --> 13:08.230
You put things straight into it
to make it safe.

13:08.430 --> 13:11.520
Hence the name-- safe.

13:12.860 --> 13:13.810
Are you done?

13:14.010 --> 13:15.340
(chuckles)
Come on, come on.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.880
It's got to be here somewhere.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.840
(sighs)
All right? We
haven't had anybody

13:19.040 --> 13:21.080
in the house
who could have, uh...

13:21.280 --> 13:23.620
Oh. Oh.
Oh? Oh, oh, what?

13:23.820 --> 13:24.920
What, what, what?

13:25.120 --> 13:28.720
Lamar. He just told us
that he's been in prison.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.560
He was?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.590
And I gave that thief
bottled water.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.840
I knew I should have just
tapped his ass.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.500
So they fed you
dinner at 05:00?

13:41.700 --> 13:45.450
Yeah, it wasn't
my biggest problem with prison.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.940
But I got to be honest, I still
get hungry at 5:00. (chuckles)

13:49.140 --> 13:50.360
Do you have an apple?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.510
Hey, Calvin, Tina,

13:54.710 --> 13:56.580
Lamar was just telling us
about his time in the joint.

13:56.780 --> 13:58.020
(door closes)

13:58.220 --> 14:00.850
Did you know that you could
wash clothes in the toilet?

14:01.050 --> 14:03.190
Hey, I did not.

14:03.390 --> 14:04.490
But why don't you tell us
all about it

14:04.690 --> 14:05.820
in the kitchen?
Yeah.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.740
Ooh, and get Lamar an apple.
Oh, yeah.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.560
(sighs)

14:10.760 --> 14:13.400
Hey, uh, Calvin, Tina,
I have to thank you

14:13.600 --> 14:15.170
for everything that
you did for me today.

14:15.370 --> 14:18.470
You know, I finally
feel like this huge...

14:18.670 --> 14:21.260
hole in my life has been filled.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.540
Well, we're about
to rip it back open.

14:24.740 --> 14:25.810
What do you mean?

14:26.010 --> 14:27.080
Dave,

14:27.280 --> 14:30.150
Lamar took
Tina's envelope of money.

14:30.350 --> 14:32.920
What?
CALVIN: Yeah.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.770
He cracked your safe?

14:37.640 --> 14:40.480
Money doesn't always
have to be in a safe.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.760
Maybe somebody
else took it.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.660
It had to be him, Dave.

14:45.860 --> 14:49.780
He's-he's the only one that's
been in our kitchen and prison.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.370
I should have known.

14:54.570 --> 14:55.810
Hate to be pushy,

14:56.010 --> 14:57.960
any ETA on that apple?

15:00.130 --> 15:01.810
You have got some nerve.

15:02.010 --> 15:03.600
An orange?

15:05.430 --> 15:06.450
You know what? Lamar,

15:06.650 --> 15:08.890
get out of my house.

15:09.090 --> 15:09.960
What?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.690
Get out of my house.

15:11.890 --> 15:14.030
Get out of my house.

15:14.230 --> 15:15.930
Whoa, Dave, what's going on?

15:16.130 --> 15:17.360
This man is a thief.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.160
Where's the money, Lamar?

15:19.360 --> 15:20.970
What money?

15:21.170 --> 15:22.670
You see?

15:22.870 --> 15:24.840
That's exactly what
a thief would say.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.370
Look at him, hands shaking,
stomach growling.

15:27.570 --> 15:29.790
It's 5:15. I'm starving.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.750
He stole money
from their kitchen.

15:34.950 --> 15:36.180
The money from the play?

15:36.380 --> 15:37.380
(Gemma sighs)

15:37.580 --> 15:39.700
And I was gonna
give you an apple.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.320
How could I be so naive?

15:43.520 --> 15:44.960
You know, I really thought
that we were

15:45.160 --> 15:46.290
starting to build something.

15:46.490 --> 15:48.390
Me too.
Dave, you have to trust me...

15:48.590 --> 15:51.360
T-Trust?
Why would I ever trust you?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.970
You know, this is exactly
what I should have expected.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.800
Everybody said that
you were a selfish loser.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.260
Mom, all the kids at school,
every waitress at Pizza Hut.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.530
But for some reason,
I held out hope.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.980
Get out of my house, Lamar.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.550
Get out of my life.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.640
You already know how to do that.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.380
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, everyone.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.170
(door closes)
(sighs) This is sad.

16:27.370 --> 16:28.530
I know.

16:28.730 --> 16:30.990
He's leaving with my money.

16:36.020 --> 16:39.110
Poor Dave.
I mean, what a roller coaster.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.310
What happened?

16:40.510 --> 16:42.080
Well, Dave had a dad,

16:42.280 --> 16:45.050
then he didn't have a dad,
then he got his dad back

16:45.250 --> 16:47.040
and he lost him again.

16:49.370 --> 16:50.520
And on top of that,

16:50.720 --> 16:52.990
my fat envelope
of cash got taken.

16:53.190 --> 16:56.360
Oh, you mean the one
that was on the counter?
Yeah.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.900
Oh, I put that
in the safe this morning.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.930
What? Wh...
Why would you do that?

17:01.130 --> 17:03.950
So it would be safe.
(short chuckle)

17:05.620 --> 17:07.370
That's why they call it
a safe, Mama.

17:07.570 --> 17:10.540
Hey, uh, Mal-Mal... Mm-mmm.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.080
Not now.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.110
Oh, my God, Calvin.

17:14.310 --> 17:16.980
And you accused that poor man
of stealing the money.

17:17.180 --> 17:20.000
Hey, I mean, you got to admit,
it was a good guess.

17:26.070 --> 17:29.130
Okay, uh, I'll check arrivals,
you check departures.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.900
Dave, this is a bus station.

17:31.100 --> 17:34.580
There's no arrivals or
departures. It's just a curb.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.400
Right. Um...

17:37.600 --> 17:39.340
Okay, w-what if he's already
gone through security?

17:39.540 --> 17:41.960
No security, just a curb.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.980
Yeah, well,
we must have missed him.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.350
(sighs) Look, Dave,

17:50.550 --> 17:52.880
I'm sorry I led you
down this path.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.800
He just looked guilty.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.320
It's all right, Calvin.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.890
You only got involved
because, well,

18:00.090 --> 18:01.580
you love me.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.930
Da... Wha...

18:04.130 --> 18:06.230
What'd I tell you about
throwing the L-word around

18:06.430 --> 18:08.420
all willy-nilly like
this in public?

18:09.620 --> 18:11.170
Ooh, there he is. Lamar. Lamar.

18:11.370 --> 18:15.110
David, what are you doing here?
Uh, well... (sighs)

18:15.310 --> 18:17.540
we wanted to tell you that

18:17.740 --> 18:19.140
we found the money.

18:19.340 --> 18:20.510
Oh, I'm glad.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.250
I told you I didn't take it.
Yeah.

18:22.450 --> 18:26.100
Look, I'm partially responsible.
He's totally responsible.

18:31.540 --> 18:34.060
Look... (sighs)

18:34.260 --> 18:35.390
This is hard for me.

18:35.590 --> 18:37.830
Let me make it easy.
Apology accepted.

18:38.030 --> 18:39.830
Yeah, no.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.150
I'm not apologizing.

18:44.020 --> 18:46.570
You know, I thought
the worst of you

18:46.770 --> 18:49.370
because you never
gave me any reason

18:49.570 --> 18:51.130
to trust you.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.910
You have to earn that.

18:55.110 --> 18:56.710
How can I do that?

18:56.910 --> 19:00.390
I haven't quite
figured that part out yet.

19:00.590 --> 19:03.960
But I'm willing to
work on it with you.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.160
Me too, son.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.990
MAN: (over P.A.):
Bus 343 is now departing
for Oxnard.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.230
That's my bus.

19:12.430 --> 19:13.800
Hope I see you again soon.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.800
Hey, uh, I-I have
one question, man. Um...

19:18.000 --> 19:20.510
You know, there is a-a Lamar,

19:20.710 --> 19:22.810
Latasha, and a Marcellus.

19:23.010 --> 19:25.210
So, where did David come from?

19:25.410 --> 19:27.410
Oh, that was actually a fight
I lost with his mom.

19:27.610 --> 19:29.530
I wanted to name him LaDavid.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.720
Come on, lil' bro,
you got this, all right?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.430
You're right, you're
right. I got this.
Yeah. Okay.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.660
(singsongy):
Good morning!

19:42.860 --> 19:44.000
You are fired!

19:44.200 --> 19:45.630
What?

19:45.830 --> 19:48.930
Boom.
You are fired.

19:49.130 --> 19:51.370
Terminated. Canned. <i>Finito!</i>

19:51.570 --> 19:53.340
Your employment here
has come to an end.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.840
Sayonara and good luck
on future endeavors,

19:56.040 --> 19:59.610
wherever they are,
because they will be elsewhere.

19:59.810 --> 20:01.180
Because, to be clear,

20:01.380 --> 20:03.110
Reynard Kittay,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.170
you are fired.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.350
But the cat has a...

20:09.550 --> 20:11.210
I don't give a damn
about no cat!

20:12.810 --> 20:13.960
Malcolm?
Yeah?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.860
Please escort this man
off the premises

20:16.060 --> 20:17.480
in case he acts a fool.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.730
Let's go, Reynard.
(scoffs)

20:20.930 --> 20:22.630
Can I at least get my Red Bull
out fridge?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.100
I drink your Red Bull.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.050
I drink it up.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.510
Wow.

20:32.710 --> 20:33.780
Who are you?

20:33.980 --> 20:37.830
I, my good man, am a boss.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.490
Yes, you are.
And you know what?

20:41.690 --> 20:43.690
I think you deserve
a parking spot.

20:43.890 --> 20:46.260
Well, all right.
(laughs)

20:46.460 --> 20:47.960
What-what...
Do we have one of those?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.990
Well, sure we do, if you,

20:50.190 --> 20:52.780
uh, paint some lines
next to the dumpster.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.720
Go on, now.
