00:46.263 --> 00:48.439
Hi, there!

00:48.483 --> 00:50.485
Oh, God. Not again.

00:50.528 --> 00:53.705
We are best friends
because, well,

00:53.749 --> 00:57.144
first of all we have
so much in common

00:57.187 --> 00:59.407
and you tell
a lot of better reasons.

00:59.450 --> 01:03.802
Well, 'cause
whenever I first met you,

01:03.846 --> 01:06.936
which was so long ago
I can't even remember...

01:06.979 --> 01:11.027
When we were like first born.
In our mums' bellies!

01:11.071 --> 01:15.075
Our mums knew each other and
went through our mums' bellies.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.294
We were like, "Hi, there!"

01:17.338 --> 01:21.168
Yeah, so we were talking
and literally

01:21.211 --> 01:25.737
I just can't, like,
picture myself without her.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.479
So, yeah,
you're my best friend.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.578
WOMAN'S VOICE: I am loved.

01:40.622 --> 01:43.015
I am special.

01:43.059 --> 01:45.148
I am enough.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.064
I am doing my best.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.415
We all are.

01:51.459 --> 01:57.856
And now we take our ropes
and we lay them around us,

01:57.900 --> 01:59.902
just like so.

01:59.945 --> 02:03.688
And, you know, when we form
a circle around ourselves

02:03.732 --> 02:05.125
we're actually reminded

02:05.168 --> 02:08.737
that we carry with us
an invisible boundary.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.652
It goes with us wherever we go

02:10.695 --> 02:13.698
and no-one enters this boundary
but us.

02:13.742 --> 02:17.311
It's our very own safe space.

02:17.354 --> 02:21.141
And now we breathe in short,
rapid breaths,

02:21.184 --> 02:23.708
just like we practised
in my last video,

02:23.752 --> 02:26.450
and for those new friends
joining us today

02:26.494 --> 02:28.278
that's Episode 253,

02:28.322 --> 02:30.933
Making Friends
With Hyperventilation.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.388
Mm.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.608
And before we seal off
our practice

02:53.651 --> 02:57.177
with 20 minutes
of blissful meditation

02:57.220 --> 02:58.352
I just want to take a moment

02:58.395 --> 03:01.659
to tell you all about
Elon Mask,

03:01.703 --> 03:05.707
the amazing, deep-cleansing,
paraben-free rubber mask.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.319
It's highly absorbent,
perfect for combination skin

03:09.363 --> 03:12.496
and I mean, look,
I use them all the time,

03:12.540 --> 03:14.585
especially before meditating.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.371
I just find that having
a fresh face,

03:17.414 --> 03:19.851
it really helps me
to connect with my body,

03:19.895 --> 03:24.465
my inner essence,
my core self.

03:24.508 --> 03:27.076
And to celebrate

03:27.119 --> 03:32.037
SincerelyCecilia reaching
200,000 followers...

03:32.081 --> 03:33.604
Ooh, wow!

03:33.648 --> 03:37.129
It's still so amazing.
Thank you.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.394

Sincerely, Cecilia.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.514
I am loved
@SincerelyCecilia.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.689
I needed this today.

04:14.732 --> 04:18.954
The world needs more people
like you.

04:18.997 --> 04:22.566
SincerelyCecilia, I think
you just saved my life.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.704
Good evening, Jane. Things have
certainly escalated in the...

05:13.748 --> 05:16.403
..mobilising troops
as international tensions rise.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.101
Sea levels are rising
at the fastest rate in three...

05:21.625 --> 05:25.368
I just... I thought
I was his pick, you know?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.762
Like, I've given
everything to him

05:27.805 --> 05:29.894
and he just goes with Shazza.
Like...

05:31.243 --> 05:33.202
Prayer, sparkle,
angel face.

05:33.245 --> 05:37.772
I... I don't get it.
Like I'm such a good person.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.905
I don't want to cry.
I'm sorry.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.386
I just feel stupid, you know?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.701
Welcome
to Pharm Animals!

05:53.744 --> 05:55.964
Udderly cheap,
udderly friendly.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.749
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.108
Hi.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.415
So my mum gets these, like,
really big headaches

06:12.459 --> 06:15.418
and, um, I don't know
if you have it here?

06:15.462 --> 06:17.507
Like, I talked to the cashier

06:17.551 --> 06:19.553
and they said that like
they don't know

06:19.596 --> 06:21.598
so like they, um...

06:21.642 --> 06:25.428
Basically I just... I need to
help her with that headache.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.648
Do you sell it
over the counter here?

06:27.691 --> 06:32.000
That is... That is available,
but you'd need a prescription.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.567
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.743
In the States they just
kind of... They sell it.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.874
So I need to go to a GP?

06:36.918 --> 06:38.746
You're gonna have to
get to a GP.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.882
- What the actual fuck!
- I just...

06:48.277 --> 06:50.714
Yeah, I'm just pregnant.
It's fine.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.631
Here.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.372
- Ah, we don't take cash.
- Excuse me.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.375
Sissy?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.378
- Oh, my God, it's you!
- Oh, my God.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.120
What's it been,
like 10, 15 years?

07:08.602 --> 07:13.607
It's... It's me, Emma.
Emma Quinn?

07:13.650 --> 07:16.784
- You remember me, right?
- Yeah.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.612
I was thinking about you
the other day,

07:18.655 --> 07:21.484
and now here you are,
right in front of me.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.355
Isn't the universe just crazy?

07:23.399 --> 07:25.053
- So crazy.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.489
It's a little embarrassing,
right?

07:26.533 --> 07:29.753
But I'm just crazy about Fran,
my fiancée.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.755
You should come to
our engagement party.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.888
- We're doing karaoke.
- Oh, I don't...

07:33.931 --> 07:36.499
Nuh, you have to come.
You have to come.

07:36.543 --> 07:40.068
Give me your handle.
I'll send you the deets.

07:42.636 --> 07:48.293
Um, it's...@SincerelyCecilia.

07:51.471 --> 07:56.824
Holy shit.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.827

Are you an influencer?

08:01.437 --> 08:02.699
Influencer?

08:02.743 --> 08:05.397
Sissy, you're doing
really well!.

08:05.441 --> 08:08.226
Ah... Cecilia.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.750

08:09.793 --> 08:11.316
Ah, it's just, um...

08:11.360 --> 08:13.405
It's actually just...

08:13.449 --> 08:15.233

08:15.277 --> 08:17.845
Oh! Yeah! Cool! I love that.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.456
Cecilia. Très profesh.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.810
It was so good to see you,
Sissy.

08:26.854 --> 08:29.509
Sorry. Sorry. Cecilia.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.906

together.

09:15.076 --> 09:18.732
You're the only person
I want to poop my pants with.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.910
Now let's do this.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.471

these like old bats

15:28.405 --> 15:31.713

fucking time

15:31.756 --> 15:36.544

15:36.587 --> 15:40.026
And then I ran into you.

15:40.069 --> 15:44.769
Like... Like what are
the fucking odds?

15:44.813 --> 15:46.771
Right? Right?

15:46.815 --> 15:50.471

It's gonna take me a second.

16:00.046 --> 16:03.179
Be there or die.

Dead face emoji.

Oh, my God,
Alex,

17:27.959 --> 17:31.093
these are so expensive!
Thank you!

17:31.137 --> 17:34.401
Um, hey, do you mind
if we change the address?

17:39.362 --> 17:41.799

Hi, guys.
Welcome to my channel.

18:46.081 --> 18:48.605
My name's Sissy and this
is my best friend, Emma,

18:48.649 --> 18:50.172
and today's her 13th birthday.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.783
Oh, my God,
is this a time capsule?

18:52.827 --> 18:55.525
Your favourite nail polish.

18:55.569 --> 19:01.618
And a poster of the hottest
man on the earth - Jakey.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.664
Who do you want to be
when you grow up?

19:03.707 --> 19:06.623
Tell all the fans at home.
They're dying to know.

19:06.667 --> 19:11.019
I don't know.
I don't really want to grow up.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.760
I don't want anything
to change.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.805
I want to stay
like this forever.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.634
Boring!

19:19.201 --> 19:21.116
I'm sorry.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.902
Let's make a pact.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.209
No matter what happens,

19:27.253 --> 19:30.212
we end up in the nursing home
together, OK?

19:30.256 --> 19:33.563
You're the only person
I wanna poop my pants with.

20:11.427 --> 20:14.648
YOUNG CECILIA'S VOICE:
I am not a sissy.

20:14.691 --> 20:18.217
I am not a sissy.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.480
I am not a sissy.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.700
- I am not a sissy.
- Hey.

20:23.744 --> 20:28.270
I'm not a sissy.
I'm not a sissy.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.011
I'm not a sissy.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.537
- I'm not a sissy.
- Who are you?

20:34.581 --> 20:36.844
I'm not a sissy.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.237
It's not my fault.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.727
Oh!

20:50.771 --> 20:53.513
Ahh! Shit!

21:01.477 --> 21:04.219
I am loved.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.700
I am special.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.571
I am enough.

21:09.616 --> 21:12.140
I am trying my best.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.055
We all are.

21:16.623 --> 21:19.103
- Hey!
- Oh, Cecilia!

21:19.147 --> 21:21.236
Do you know how to drive stick?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.804
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.850
- Of course.
- Keys.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.765
Thank you.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.767
- Right.
- Hurry up, Franny!

21:30.811 --> 21:32.508
OK, well,
if y'all helped me

21:32.552 --> 21:34.945
I would have been in the car
five minutes ago.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.078
I'm so sorry for being disabled
and not be able to help you.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.123
It's such a hard life for you,
isn't it?

21:39.167 --> 21:41.735
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.999
I'm really glad you came.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.414
Shhh!

22:52.458 --> 22:55.286
- Ooh!

22:59.334 --> 23:01.292
Shut the fuck up.
- What?

23:03.251 --> 23:04.339
Shut up!

23:04.383 --> 23:05.862
What, what? What -

23:05.906 --> 23:08.430
Oh, Alex just sent me
a photo of where we're staying

23:08.474 --> 23:12.042
and it's like,
"This is your vacation home."

23:12.086 --> 23:13.827
Like, what is her life?

23:13.870 --> 23:15.829
Um, Alex?

23:15.872 --> 23:17.221
Yeah, ah, Alex Kutis.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.441
Didn't y'all go to school
together?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.536
Come on, Sissy,
don't be a sissy.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.278
Sissy, the sissy.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.541
Sissy, the sissy.

23:32.585 --> 23:35.544
Sissy, the sissy.
- I'm not a sissy.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.765
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

23:38.808 --> 23:42.159
- Sissy...
- Watch out!

23:42.203 --> 23:44.684
What the fuck was that?

23:44.727 --> 23:46.207
I think it was a roo!

23:46.250 --> 23:48.470
Get out the car.
Get out front. Is anyone hurt?

23:48.514 --> 23:49.863
I'm a vegan, guys.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.082
- This is really not cool.
Oh, shit, my neck!

23:52.126 --> 23:53.910
Come on.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.397
Oh.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.138
This is so fucked.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.532
Will someone please
finish it off?

24:06.575 --> 24:10.318
I... I don't suppose anyone
has a gun?

24:10.361 --> 24:14.540
We're in Australia, babe.
We drive back over shit here.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.152
Where's the keys?

24:19.283 --> 24:21.329
Cecilia?

24:27.422 --> 24:29.468
Cecilia. Keys.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.949
- But it...it's still alive.
- Barely.

24:32.993 --> 24:36.126
Look, it's the humane thing
to do.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.911
My dad is selling
this car next week.

24:37.954 --> 24:40.261
- He's gonna be so pissed!
It's a shitty Tarago.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.524
Couldn't be worth
more than $200 anyway.

25:18.386 --> 25:21.215
Oh, my God,
this is gorgeous!

25:21.258 --> 25:23.696
Wow!

25:25.262 --> 25:27.221
My God,
it's so beautiful!

25:27.264 --> 25:29.484
- I wanna fuck this house.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.835
-Bitch, we're here!
-We're here!

25:35.055 --> 25:37.405
Alex, can I please have
intercourse with your house?

25:37.448 --> 25:38.972
Yeah,
if you don't mind.

25:39.015 --> 25:41.235
I wanna come inside.
Oh!

25:42.976 --> 25:44.630
Yeah, let's do it! OK.

25:46.109 --> 25:47.633
This is so beautiful!

25:56.467 --> 25:58.861
Let us in!

26:19.186 --> 26:20.404
Hey.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.276
Um...

27:23.903 --> 27:26.470
Pussy!

27:37.917 --> 27:40.571
G... G'day.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.792
Sissy?

27:43.836 --> 27:50.103
Um... Ah, yeah, you know,
it's actually Cecilia now.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.757
Yeah, how crazy is this?

27:51.800 --> 27:55.848
I ran into Cecilia yesterday,
right, at the pharmacy,

27:55.891 --> 27:57.806
and then I invited...
Alex.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.460
Alex!

27:59.503 --> 28:01.941
Um, Alex? Ow, my hand.

28:01.984 --> 28:05.727
Um, she, um...

28:05.771 --> 28:07.468
What just happened?

28:07.511 --> 28:09.992
Awkward!

28:11.690 --> 28:12.995
Oh, this is cute.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.217
Shut up!

28:17.260 --> 28:18.914
I'm so sorry.
I didn't, honestly...

28:18.958 --> 28:20.655
- She's crazy.
- I know.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.309
I fucking hate her.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.572
I didn't think she'd actually
come. I forgot I invited her.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.530
She's a psycho.

28:34.103 --> 28:38.891
Oh, fuck! That was
great. They're gonna love it.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.719
She has
the weirdest crap, hey?

28:40.762 --> 28:42.982
She? Why do you have to
gender her?

28:47.508 --> 28:48.988
Sorry, Cecilia.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.164
Emma neglected to inform me
that you'd be joining us.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.295
Oh.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.775
Unfortunately all
the beds are taken

28:53.819 --> 28:55.777
but you are welcome to sleep
on the couch.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.606
Oh, thanks.
The couch is totally fine.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.390
Sorry, I didn't
know about the beds.

29:00.434 --> 29:02.436
That's OK.

29:03.524 --> 29:06.005
Ooh, bitches!
Paradise Lost!

29:07.920 --> 29:09.182
Are you guys serious?

29:09.225 --> 29:12.359
This is the most...
THE most commercial,

29:12.402 --> 29:13.882
white, privileged bullshit -

29:13.926 --> 29:15.797
- Oh, shut it, Saint Frances!
It's an example

29:15.841 --> 29:18.191
of how much we've slipped
as a society.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.801
It is.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.978
- Oh, my God, she's so dumb.
- Her bikini.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.937
OK, I'm just going
to the toilet.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.026
Do we just like
objectify women?

29:27.069 --> 29:29.506
- Are they real, though?
- They're not real!

29:29.550 --> 29:31.247
- Is it, um...
- None of these are real.

29:31.291 --> 29:34.120
- OK, but I guarantee you...
- Is it round that way or...?

29:34.163 --> 29:36.600
..half of these girls are
sleeping with each other.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.343
Sorry, I'm busting,
so I'm just gonna...

29:42.868 --> 29:46.306
Don't judge him.
He's a loser.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.657
He's disgusting!

29:49.700 --> 29:50.876
You know this is all scripted.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.834
Have you guys never done that
before?

29:57.708 --> 29:59.841
I am loved.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.365
I am special.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.804
I am enough.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.894
I am trying my best.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.113
We all are.

30:13.637 --> 30:16.466
Yeah, we all are.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.955
I'm sure
it's like a two-point deal.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.392
Like one boob job, the other
boob job, you know what I mean?

30:29.436 --> 30:31.133
You still gonna do that for me?

30:31.177 --> 30:33.570
- No. Stop it.
- I'm joking. It was a joke.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.746
- "I'm joking."
- No, it's not.

30:35.790 --> 30:38.445
- You can't make up this shit.
- It's trash.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.621
Ah, excuse me?

30:40.664 --> 30:42.318
Thank you. Thank you.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.712
And the gaslighting this season
is like the crème de la crme.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.757
Hey, so I just wanted to make
a little speech.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.369
It's artistry.
- Of course it is.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.458
It's so good.
It's just like...

30:51.501 --> 30:53.460
Emma?

30:53.503 --> 30:56.419
- It's not!
- It's beautifully scripted.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.292
- It's the best writing ever!
- Hey, Emma!

30:59.335 --> 31:02.773
- Sorry.
- Hey.

31:02.817 --> 31:07.126
Sorry.
Um, I, ah, I got you this.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.955
Well, I... I mean it's, ah...

31:09.998 --> 31:13.872
I guess it's an early
wedding present.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.744
Something old.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.703
Is this our time capsule?

31:19.747 --> 31:23.185
Oh, my God,
I totally forgot about this!

31:23.229 --> 31:27.059
Oh, Cecilia!
This is amazing.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.538
This is like that
Britney Spears movie

31:28.582 --> 31:29.844
where they bury their dreams
in a box

31:29.888 --> 31:31.933
before they get their period
but by prom

31:31.977 --> 31:33.630
they hate each other
and one of them gets knocked up

31:33.674 --> 31:35.850
and wants to paddle in the
Pacific 'cause her life's over.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.505
- J.G.
- J.G.!

31:38.548 --> 31:40.028
He's too hot.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.943
Do you know how many times
I made out with this poster?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.553
Hold on, this is the best part.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.599
How many times did that
make out with your vagina lips?

31:45.642 --> 31:48.732
Yeah, that's yours! Fuck it.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.213
Hey, guys.

31:51.257 --> 31:54.260
Ah, but what about Paradise?

31:54.303 --> 31:58.220
I promise it'll be so worth it.
Alright?

31:58.264 --> 32:01.267
Just...fuckin' wait.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.138
Babe!

32:05.053 --> 32:07.751
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.061
I totally forgot
about this!

32:13.105 --> 32:17.370
I know!
- Look at us! We're so little.

32:17.413 --> 32:22.549
Literally I just can't, like,
picture myself without her.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.638
So, yeah, you're my best -

32:26.814 --> 32:28.685
Dinner's ready.

32:28.729 --> 32:31.950
But Remy's gonna bitch slap
Chloe!

32:31.993 --> 32:33.299
But I'm gonna bitch slap
you

32:33.342 --> 32:35.301
if you don't get your ass
to that table

32:35.344 --> 32:37.738
because I am really hungry.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.261
Yes, Mum.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.003
I'm gonna get changed.
I smell like rotten cum.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.570
Not mine!

32:43.613 --> 32:47.574
-Your CEO's maybe?
-Don't you fucking dare!

32:47.617 --> 32:49.619
Alex!

32:49.663 --> 32:52.361
Sissy,
don't be a sissy.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.624
Oh, my God, Alex,
these are so expensive!

32:54.668 --> 32:56.452
Happy birthday,
biatch!

32:56.496 --> 32:58.411
And to Alex, my maid of honour,

32:58.454 --> 33:00.761
thank you for hosting us all
this weekend. I love you.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.415
I am loved.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.634
It's the least I could do after
missing your engagement party.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.810
I am special.
I am enough.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.769
And your beautiful
lives together.

33:08.812 --> 33:12.729
I am doing
my best. We all are.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.688
I'll get down on one knee.

33:14.731 --> 33:20.737
I am confident.
I am special. I am enough.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.870
- ..his married CEO!

33:22.913 --> 33:24.828
I'm doing my best.

33:26.874 --> 33:30.660
What about you, Cecilia?
Are you dating anybody?

33:35.056 --> 33:37.145
Oh, nah.

33:37.189 --> 33:39.974
Nah, I don't really have time,
you know?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.194
I'm just like busy and focused

33:42.237 --> 33:45.153
but guess that sounds kinda...
kinda stupid, right?

33:45.197 --> 33:49.636
Not at all. Not when you're as
successful as you are.

33:49.679 --> 33:52.726
- Really? What do you do?
- Oh, I'm... I'm a -

33:52.769 --> 33:55.033
- She's an influencer.
- An influencer?

33:55.076 --> 33:57.948
- Well, um...
- That's your fulltime job?

33:57.992 --> 33:59.515
Pretty much.

33:59.559 --> 34:02.040
She has like
200,000 followers.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.520
Fuck off.
That's more than Alex.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.131
Oh, are you an influencer too?

34:06.174 --> 34:08.350
Ew. No.

34:08.394 --> 34:11.701
Fuck off!
You know Chris Hemsworth?

34:11.745 --> 34:15.140
No. No.
I wouldn't say I know him,

34:15.183 --> 34:17.272
I just promoted his app
for a little bit.

34:17.316 --> 34:22.799
- And you got paid to do that?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

34:22.843 --> 34:26.412
Fucking hell. I'm the least
cool person at this table.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.979
I've been telling you
that for years, babe.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.939
So what's your thing?
Are you like a model, or...

34:31.982 --> 34:35.464
Nuh. No, definitely not.

34:36.509 --> 34:39.555
You're like a therapist, right?

34:39.599 --> 34:42.428
I'm more like a mental health
advocate.

34:42.471 --> 34:43.820
You know, basically

34:43.864 --> 34:46.127
I just try to
help people with their issues.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.650
Like what?

34:47.694 --> 34:52.046
You know, like confidence,
self-worth, self-acceptance,

34:52.090 --> 34:53.830
anxiety, depression,
OCD.

34:53.874 --> 34:57.138
That's really cool. Do you need
a degree for that, or...

34:57.182 --> 34:59.532
Oh, I'm...
I'm not a psychologist.

34:59.575 --> 35:03.318
I'm just, ah...well,
just a fellow human

35:03.362 --> 35:04.711
trying to, you know,

35:04.754 --> 35:06.495
share some things that I've
learned along the way.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.367
How much money do you make?

35:08.410 --> 35:10.108
Tracey!
- What?

35:10.151 --> 35:13.459
- That's none of our business.
- Yes, it is.

35:13.502 --> 35:14.721
If she's a public figure

35:14.764 --> 35:16.766
and she's profiting
from people's pain

35:16.810 --> 35:20.161
then that should be
public knowledge.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.032
I'm not profiting from -

35:22.076 --> 35:23.860
Actually, Alex has a point.

35:23.904 --> 35:27.168
You're getting paid, maybe not
by your followers directly

35:27.212 --> 35:29.518
but you're influencing them to
buy whatever you're advertising

35:29.562 --> 35:31.346
and you're not qualified.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.349
Which, legally, is very murky.

35:34.393 --> 35:37.222
I mean, what if someone
killed themselves

35:37.265 --> 35:38.614
because you didn't
check your DMs?

35:38.658 --> 35:40.138
- Jamie!
- I'm serious.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.184
Cecilia could
get into a lot of trouble.

35:43.228 --> 35:46.361
No, I've always been
very clear with my followers,

35:46.405 --> 35:49.234
you know, from the beginning,
that I'm not a professional.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.846
Sometimes people want to feel
seen, you know?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.891
They wanna feel like, um...

35:54.935 --> 35:59.200
..somebody sees their value
and they want to feel loved.

35:59.244 --> 36:03.291
So, um... I just try to remind
people that they're special.

36:03.335 --> 36:04.727
It's kind of like
what you do, babe.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.121
- Oh.
- Oh, what do you do?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.645
She's a psychologist.

36:09.689 --> 36:12.257
Oh, like an actual
psychologist.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.606
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Wow.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.042
I'm not a psychologist.

36:15.085 --> 36:18.524
I...have a few years left
on my doctorate

36:18.567 --> 36:20.134
- so I'm studying to be.
- Whoa.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.397
- That's really cool.
- Thanks.

36:22.441 --> 36:25.270
Fran helps real people
with real problems

36:25.313 --> 36:28.186
- whereas in Sissy's case...
- Cecilia...

36:28.229 --> 36:30.405
..you could argue that those
people aren't even like real.

36:30.449 --> 36:34.496
Alex, of course Cecilia's
followers are real people.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.846
-Are they, though?
-Alex.

36:36.890 --> 36:39.980
No, no, no, I mean,
Alex is right.

36:40.023 --> 36:44.202
What I'm doing is nothing
compared to what Fran's doing.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.638
That's incredible.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.336
Well, to Fran and Cecilia.

36:48.380 --> 36:52.166
The world needs more
people like you. Cheers.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.212
Cheers.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.910
I just... I'm sorry,

36:56.953 --> 36:59.521
but I can't help but find it
all a little bit ironic.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.480
Ironic?
- Yeah, that of all people

37:01.523 --> 37:03.786
Sissy is preaching
about mental health.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.093
Cecilia.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.182
- What are you, rebranding?
- Alex.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.880
Guys!

37:27.984 --> 37:29.769
OK.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.645
I am enough.

37:36.689 --> 37:38.908
I...I am...

37:41.389 --> 37:43.696
..trying my best. Fuck.

37:56.970 --> 37:59.233
The world needs more
people like you.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.672
I hate myself. Please help.
I'm #trying.

38:03.716 --> 38:06.675
Knock, knock!
- Hi.

38:06.719 --> 38:10.331
Hey. Do you mind if I join you?

38:13.378 --> 38:14.640
Whoo!

38:15.989 --> 38:18.339
- Come on in.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.950
The water's great!

38:27.392 --> 38:29.132
Are you OK?

38:33.702 --> 38:37.532
- Yes. Fuck.
- Oh, don't cry.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.621
Please don't cry.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.406
Fuck.

38:41.449 --> 38:45.061
- Cecilia.
- I'm sorry.

38:46.236 --> 38:49.544
I just feel like I...

38:50.980 --> 38:54.723
I've just tried so hard to...

38:54.767 --> 39:00.773
..to like...to heal
and to move on and...

39:00.816 --> 39:07.083
Whatever. I'm always gonna be
Sissy, the sissy to her.

39:07.127 --> 39:11.044
Well, you know what?
Fuck Alex.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.394
Seriously. Seriously!

39:13.438 --> 39:15.353
- Fuck Alex?
- Yeah.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.442
Do you know how much
fucked-up shit

39:17.485 --> 39:19.052
she's done over the years?

39:19.095 --> 39:23.099
But like this is what I think,
OK?

39:23.143 --> 39:27.930
All of that stuff that happened
between the two of you

39:27.974 --> 39:30.019
was a lifetime ago.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.807
It was an accident.
You were a child.

39:34.850 --> 39:37.157
Like you didn't know
what you were doing.

39:39.246 --> 39:43.468
You are a really good person,
Cecilia.

39:43.511 --> 39:44.904
Mm.

39:44.947 --> 39:47.950
And I'm really glad you came.

39:47.994 --> 39:51.345
So I would like for you
to stop punishing yourself

39:51.389 --> 39:54.261
and just have some fun with me,
OK?

39:56.002 --> 39:58.961
Yeah, righto, OK.

39:59.005 --> 40:02.661
- Do you think it's expired?
- Oh my God.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.793
Come on.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.447
Righto.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.453
- Ohhh.
- Ahhh!

40:12.497 --> 40:14.760
Ohhh. Ooh, still good.

40:14.803 --> 40:17.545
You know, you're exactly
how you said you'd turn out.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.634
Oh, God, really?

40:19.678 --> 40:21.897
What did I say?

40:39.132 --> 40:42.004
God!

41:02.808 --> 41:04.897
Bad dream?

41:08.074 --> 41:12.034
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just came to get some water.

41:14.689 --> 41:16.735
Do you mind if I sit?

41:19.389 --> 41:21.304
Go ahead, yep.

41:29.269 --> 41:31.793
I can't sleep either.

41:40.454 --> 41:46.068
I feel really bad about before.
I'm sorry.

41:46.112 --> 41:49.681
- Oh, look, that's OK.
- Truce?

41:53.467 --> 41:55.425
Um...

41:57.036 --> 41:59.473
Yeah. Yeah.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.257
Yeah. Truce.

42:05.784 --> 42:09.744
You have the softest hands.

42:09.788 --> 42:11.790
Thanks.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.662
Do you moisturise?

42:14.706 --> 42:19.798
Yeah. Um, I use this...
this...

42:19.841 --> 42:23.323
..stuff. Um.. Do...
Do you want...

42:23.366 --> 42:25.107
Maybe...

42:27.980 --> 42:30.199
Maybe you can help me
with this.

43:16.811 --> 43:18.770
Oh!

43:28.780 --> 43:30.172
Thanks, Trace.

43:30.216 --> 43:32.305
Look, I'm just trying to change

43:32.348 --> 43:34.220
the ionic composition
of the air

43:34.263 --> 43:38.790
so we can all reduce our stress
levels after last night's vibe.

43:38.833 --> 43:42.054
Speaking of.
Where is Sissy?

43:42.097 --> 43:44.796
Her name is
Su-sil-ee-ah.

43:44.839 --> 43:48.713
Guys. Not today, please?
Please? Please?

43:48.756 --> 43:51.585
This saviour complex you've
got going is so boring, Em.

43:51.629 --> 43:55.328
Saviour complex?
- The chick's a total killjoy.

43:55.371 --> 43:58.940
Weren't you the one who was
gushing about how cool she was?

43:58.984 --> 44:01.987
I mean, you've literally
never mentioned her

44:02.030 --> 44:03.771
and she's invited
to our hens'.

44:03.815 --> 44:05.033
Babe!

44:05.077 --> 44:06.295
I don't have a problem with it.

44:06.339 --> 44:08.080
It's just a little weird,
don't you think?

44:08.123 --> 44:09.821
Actually, Fran,
it's textbook Emma.

44:09.864 --> 44:11.866
I couldn't stand her
when we were kids

44:11.910 --> 44:13.694
'cause she clung to you
like a fucking koala.

44:13.738 --> 44:17.611
But you were too chickenshit
to tell her, so I had to.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.613
And we both know
how that ended.

44:22.137 --> 44:23.704
How?
- Fuck off!

44:23.748 --> 44:25.184
Yep. Deadset.

44:25.227 --> 44:27.099
-Are you serious?
-Hell, no, that was her?

44:27.142 --> 44:30.058
She's not your best friend.
I'm her best friend.

44:30.102 --> 44:34.323
Really? Well, you're not even
invited to her birthday party.

44:34.367 --> 44:35.716
Alex!

44:35.760 --> 44:37.109
What birthday party?

44:37.152 --> 44:39.981
Well, it's just...
I didn't think you would come.

44:40.025 --> 44:41.200
All the girls are there

44:41.243 --> 44:43.028
and you don't really
get along with them.

44:43.071 --> 44:45.683
So you didn't invite me
to your birthday party?

44:45.726 --> 44:48.511
-I knew it! I knew it!
-Why did you invite her?

44:48.555 --> 44:49.774
She's a psycho!

44:49.817 --> 44:51.384
Oh, my God!

44:51.427 --> 44:54.953
Alex, it's not like you're a
victim. You were bullying her.

44:55.910 --> 44:57.433
Fuck you.

44:57.477 --> 45:00.175
OK, OK, OK, let's just chill,
team, yeah? Just chill?

45:00.219 --> 45:02.308
No, if she's gonna defend
that psycho over me,

45:02.351 --> 45:04.092
then fuck her.

45:04.136 --> 45:09.141
Alex, we were 12 years
old. It is time to get over it.

45:09.184 --> 45:10.577
You're not the one

45:10.620 --> 45:12.013
who has to look in the mirror
every morning

45:12.057 --> 45:14.755
- and be reminded of her.
Sissy's cancelled!

45:14.799 --> 45:16.409
I knew there was
something off about her.

45:16.452 --> 45:18.759
All that self-help stuff
that she spouts?

45:18.803 --> 45:20.805
I mean, this is exactly
what's wrong with social media.

45:20.848 --> 45:22.458
It's a breeding ground
for con artists.

45:22.502 --> 45:24.243
Like Belle Gibson.

45:24.286 --> 45:26.027
Exactly!
Sissy's cancelled!

45:26.071 --> 45:27.507
Jamie, stop.

45:27.550 --> 45:29.770
Can't argue with the clicks,
bitch!

45:30.902 --> 45:32.512
Baby, where are you going?

45:32.555 --> 45:34.775
I'm cold.
I'm going back to the bridge.

45:34.819 --> 45:36.081
Yeah, me too.

45:36.124 --> 45:39.171
OK, well, can you just
give me a second?

45:39.214 --> 45:41.826
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

45:41.869 --> 45:44.959
- I should probably...
- That's OK. Go.

45:45.003 --> 45:47.092
We need to crack
that brie ASAP!

45:47.135 --> 45:48.180
I love you.

45:48.223 --> 45:49.529
You're
lactose intolerant.

45:49.572 --> 45:50.791
No, I'm not!

45:50.835 --> 45:52.401
Your farts were
so rank last night,

45:52.445 --> 45:53.925
I literally couldn't breathe.

45:53.968 --> 45:56.362
-You're homophobic.
-No, dude, she's right.

45:56.405 --> 45:57.755
It's like on another level,

45:57.798 --> 45:59.626
and I think you should really
see a doctor.

45:59.669 --> 46:02.803
I don't need to see a
doctor, OK? I want my cheese.

46:02.847 --> 46:04.544
Just leave me alone!
You guys are bullying me.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.807
- Stop bullying me!

46:06.851 --> 46:10.115
Well, you're not even
invited to her birthday party.

46:10.158 --> 46:13.422
Come on, Sissy,
don't be a sissy.

46:13.466 --> 46:16.382
Sissy, the sissy.

46:16.425 --> 46:19.124
Sissy, the sissy.

46:19.167 --> 46:22.867
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

46:22.910 --> 46:25.826
Sissy, the sissy
Sissy, the sissy.

46:25.870 --> 46:28.698
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

46:28.742 --> 46:31.571
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

46:31.614 --> 46:34.008
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the...

46:34.052 --> 46:35.923
Sissy!

46:35.967 --> 46:38.273
I know you're there.

46:44.584 --> 46:46.368
Hey!

47:00.556 --> 47:02.732
Ooh! It's cold.

47:18.574 --> 47:21.273
Why are you here?

47:21.316 --> 47:23.971
Um, Emma left me a map.

47:24.015 --> 47:29.150
No, why are you here
at Emma's hens'?

47:33.285 --> 47:36.462
I get that you didn't
expect me to be here

47:36.505 --> 47:38.725
so you're probably feeling
really triggered.

47:38.768 --> 47:43.295
And I'm sorry for that.
Like I really am.

47:46.124 --> 47:48.387
I hate knowing that
my presence

47:48.430 --> 47:49.910
is resurfacing old trauma
for you

47:49.954 --> 47:51.477
but wouldn't it be better

47:51.520 --> 47:54.306
- if we just put this -
- Stop it! Ugh. Stop it, OK?

47:54.349 --> 47:56.308
- What?
- No-one's around.

47:56.351 --> 47:58.223
- So you can just drop the act.
- It's not an act.

47:58.266 --> 48:00.399
I'm just trying to connect
with you.

48:00.442 --> 48:02.836
You can't
connect with anyone, Sissy.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.969
You're a psychopath.

48:06.709 --> 48:09.277
Um...

48:09.321 --> 48:11.932
I'm not a psychopath.

48:11.976 --> 48:14.630
- Say that to my face.
- I'm not.

48:16.328 --> 48:19.679
Or better yet
your followers.

48:19.722 --> 48:22.856
W... What, is that my phone?
Did you...

48:22.900 --> 48:25.250
Did you take my phone?

48:26.947 --> 48:28.427
Go on.

48:28.470 --> 48:31.604
Tell them what you did to me.
Go on.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.519
Tell them.

48:37.653 --> 48:40.918
Fine.

48:40.961 --> 48:45.052
- Alex...
- Hey, friends!

48:45.096 --> 48:49.056
I have something to tell you
about your beloved guru.

48:49.100 --> 48:52.364
Cecilia is not as sincere
as you think she is.

48:52.407 --> 48:54.453
How do I know this?

48:54.496 --> 48:56.977
Well, see this scar?

48:57.021 --> 49:00.807
Once upon a time,
she lost her fucking mind

49:00.850 --> 49:02.330
and she tried to murder me.

49:02.374 --> 49:03.897
OK, that's enough.

49:25.875 --> 49:27.529
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

49:30.706 --> 49:32.578
I'm not a sissy!

50:02.347 --> 50:04.262
It's not my fault.

50:04.305 --> 50:05.698
It's not my fault.

50:05.741 --> 50:07.439
Help!
- It's not my fault.

50:10.224 --> 50:13.010
- Help!
- It's not my fault.

50:13.053 --> 50:15.012
- It's not my fault.

50:15.055 --> 50:17.275
Help! Help!

50:17.318 --> 50:19.973
- Help!

51:29.347 --> 51:31.175
Fuck! Fuck!

51:31.218 --> 51:33.090
Alex!

52:37.980 --> 52:42.246
Oh, wow.
Look at these beautiful trees.

52:42.289 --> 52:45.379
And can you hear that?

52:45.423 --> 52:47.207
Silence.

52:47.251 --> 52:50.341
It's so rare, especially
these days, and you know what?

52:50.384 --> 52:53.126
Now would be a great time
to meditate

52:53.170 --> 52:55.955
but first I just wanted
to remind us all

52:55.998 --> 52:58.914
about the power of
kindness.

52:58.958 --> 53:01.613
I found this little
uprooted plant

53:01.656 --> 53:03.919
and I thought
why not repropagate it?

53:03.963 --> 53:05.356
I mean, it's the least
I can do

53:05.399 --> 53:07.967
to offset the erosion
I'm causing by hiking today.

53:08.010 --> 53:10.012
Pay it forward.

53:10.056 --> 53:13.233
And, you know,
simple acts of kindness

53:13.277 --> 53:16.323
are actually known to activate
the area of the brain

53:16.367 --> 53:18.586
that is linked
to improved mood.

53:18.630 --> 53:21.328
So keep that in mind.

53:21.372 --> 53:23.417
And, hey, don't worry
if you don't have a shovel.

53:23.461 --> 53:25.419
I mean,
that's what our hands are for.

53:25.463 --> 53:27.769
Plus, if we get a little dirt
under our nails,

53:27.813 --> 53:30.772
maybe we'll get
a bonus boost of B12.

53:30.816 --> 53:34.646
Alright, everyone.
I love you.

53:34.689 --> 53:36.865
Sincerely, Cecilia.

53:40.173 --> 53:42.044
Fuck!

54:08.984 --> 54:11.117
Wow.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.162
So beautiful.

54:25.523 --> 54:28.003
Hello?

54:29.178 --> 54:31.920
Don't fuck with me, Trace.

54:31.964 --> 54:34.619
My cock's out

54:34.662 --> 54:39.101
and I'm not afraid to use it!

54:40.538 --> 54:43.889
Hey! Jamie.

54:43.932 --> 54:46.457
Were you watching me pee?

54:46.500 --> 54:48.023
No.

54:49.068 --> 54:51.418
Gross.

54:51.462 --> 54:53.638
Nah, I just couldn't find
you guys.

54:57.294 --> 55:00.209
- What happened to you?
- Hmm?

55:00.253 --> 55:05.650
Oh, ah... I tripped
back there. I stacked it.

55:05.693 --> 55:08.000
I went flying.
You should have seen it.

55:08.043 --> 55:11.525
- OK.
- Yeah.

55:11.569 --> 55:14.093
I'm really high right now.

55:18.010 --> 55:21.013
Right, should we go?
Let's go. Let's just...

55:21.056 --> 55:23.145
Should we just head that way,
or...

55:23.189 --> 55:25.800
- Oh!
- Argh!

55:28.020 --> 55:30.544
Fuckin' piss!

55:32.503 --> 55:34.679
Fuck. Sorry.

55:34.722 --> 55:36.942
- Here you go.
- You're pretty.

55:36.985 --> 55:40.206
- You're pretty.
- Shut up.

55:40.249 --> 55:42.904
Shall we go?

55:47.474 --> 55:51.565
- What the fuck?
- Oh!

55:51.609 --> 55:56.222
Oh, my God! Is that Alex?

55:59.921 --> 56:04.491
Hey, Jamie!
Jamie, come back!

56:04.535 --> 56:06.972
Jamie! Jamie! Hold on!

56:07.015 --> 56:09.714
Just... If you just wait
one second!

56:10.845 --> 56:13.021
Just wait a second! Jamie!

56:13.065 --> 56:16.460
You have picked this card
today to help you remember

56:16.503 --> 56:19.027
the importance
of spending time in nature

56:19.071 --> 56:22.770
and connecting with Mother
Nature's healing energies.

56:26.252 --> 56:30.430
Ha. I'll see you guys
back at the house, yeah?

56:30.474 --> 56:31.910
What? You don't have to leave.

56:31.953 --> 56:34.739
Oh, no, no,
I really need some me time.

56:34.782 --> 56:37.611
OK, well, can you check
on Jamie, please?

56:37.655 --> 56:39.570
Yes, Mum!

56:46.620 --> 56:52.147
Look, the thing that I love
most about you

56:52.191 --> 56:54.802
is that you always see
the good in people.

56:56.543 --> 57:01.983
But it's also
one of your biggest flaws.

57:04.812 --> 57:07.119
Which is why...

57:07.162 --> 57:11.166
..you always end up
feeling this way.

57:11.210 --> 57:14.126
You just...

57:14.169 --> 57:16.998
You just need to relax.

57:28.575 --> 57:32.492
I'm sorry. I can't.
I just...

57:32.536 --> 57:34.973
I should probably
go apologise.

57:38.933 --> 57:41.370
Cool.

57:41.414 --> 57:42.981
Great.

57:43.024 --> 57:46.375
Jamie!

57:46.419 --> 57:48.334
Jamie!

57:57.691 --> 57:59.345
Hey.

57:59.388 --> 58:00.955
- Jamie!

58:00.999 --> 58:02.696
Wait! Wait!

58:02.740 --> 58:05.351
- Wait.
- Just let me explain!

58:05.394 --> 58:07.005
Stay the fuck away from me!

58:07.048 --> 58:10.095
It was an accident!

58:10.138 --> 58:13.359
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise!

58:13.402 --> 58:16.275
Alex had it out for me
for years, alright.

58:16.318 --> 58:19.278
And she attacked me and
I didn't have any other choice.

58:19.321 --> 58:20.888
I had to defend myself.

58:20.932 --> 58:24.457
If it was self-defence, then
why hide it? Why not tell us?

58:27.678 --> 58:30.724
I mean, I'm cancelled,
aren't I?

58:32.596 --> 58:34.815
Aren't I cancelled?

58:34.859 --> 58:38.515
So why would any of you
believe me, even if I told you?

58:39.907 --> 58:41.518
Just...

58:43.389 --> 58:45.957
Please, Jamie.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.959
Please help me.

58:48.002 --> 58:51.658
I feel really scared.

58:51.702 --> 58:55.619
Um, it's OK, OK? It's OK.
I'm here, OK?

58:55.662 --> 58:57.664
I've got you. You're safe.

58:57.708 --> 59:00.101
- I see you.
Jamie!

59:00.145 --> 59:01.799
Hey!

59:01.842 --> 59:03.888
Trace-

59:07.674 --> 59:10.285
Jamie!

59:13.854 --> 59:17.597
Jamie! Jamie!

59:19.512 --> 59:23.777
Oh! Oh! Ugh!

59:23.821 --> 59:26.998
Bitch, Paradise Lost is on soon
and I'm not waiting for you!

59:27.041 --> 59:29.827
- Jamie!
- Alex!

59:31.132 --> 59:32.699
Hey,
this is Alex.

59:32.743 --> 59:35.093
Just text a message.
Don't leave me a voicemail

59:35.136 --> 59:37.791
because I'm never gonna
listen to it, OK? Bye!

1:00:17.526 --> 1:00:20.355
I'm not a sissy.
I'm not a sissy.

1:00:29.538 --> 1:00:31.105
All hail, queen.

1:00:31.149 --> 1:00:33.673
SincerelyCecilia,
love your vibe, babe.

1:00:33.717 --> 1:00:35.762
DM us for a collab.

1:01:08.186 --> 1:01:09.709
You know more guys
are coming in here

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:11.450
and they're gonna
throw their dicks at you.

1:01:11.493 --> 1:01:13.582
They better. They better fully
throw their dicks at me,

1:01:13.626 --> 1:01:14.845
otherwise I'm actually done.

1:01:14.888 --> 1:01:16.150
I'm gonna walk
out of the house.

1:01:16.194 --> 1:01:18.065
I can't believe
he didn't pick me.

1:01:18.109 --> 1:01:20.589
- His loss, babe.
Yes. Absolutely.

1:01:20.633 --> 1:01:23.723
In your face. That's it.
- Fuck, yeah, babe!

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:25.594
You got a snack,
I got a snack...

1:01:27.248 --> 1:01:29.773
I mean, I him
one time -

1:01:29.816 --> 1:01:32.689
- Wait, you him?
- No, it was before this even -

1:02:17.864 --> 1:02:19.518
Help.

1:02:19.561 --> 1:02:22.826
- Holy shit, are you OK?
- Help me, please.

1:02:27.091 --> 1:02:29.136
OK, the magnesium
will soothe your body

1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:31.095
and this should help
soothe your face.

1:02:31.138 --> 1:02:33.271
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you're sponsored by Elon Mask.

1:02:33.314 --> 1:02:35.012
Like, that's amazing.

1:02:40.060 --> 1:02:41.496
- Oh, are you...

1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:43.237
Are you crying?

1:02:44.891 --> 1:02:49.069
It's OK. Um... I can't
believe she did this to you.

1:02:49.113 --> 1:02:50.157
When the others get back

1:02:50.201 --> 1:02:52.290
we'll just hash it all out,
yeah?

1:02:52.333 --> 1:02:54.422
Maybe Alex just needed
to get back at you

1:02:54.466 --> 1:02:56.511
to feel better or something.

1:02:58.818 --> 1:03:00.864
Get back at me for what?

1:03:02.648 --> 1:03:04.171
Ah, I don't know. Um...

1:03:04.215 --> 1:03:05.782
That wasn't my fault.

1:03:05.825 --> 1:03:07.479
Yeah, I'm not saying it was.

1:03:09.220 --> 1:03:11.613
So why are you looking at me
like that then?

1:03:14.399 --> 1:03:17.358
- Stop staring at me!
- Sorry.

1:03:19.578 --> 1:03:21.754
Sorry.

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:23.974
- Hey, um...
- It's OK.

1:03:24.017 --> 1:03:26.846
..just having
a really weird day.

1:03:26.890 --> 1:03:30.545
Um... I'm just going to...

1:03:30.589 --> 1:03:32.112
..going to get my phone.

1:03:32.156 --> 1:03:34.767
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on.

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:37.204
- Please can you... Sissy.

1:03:37.248 --> 1:03:40.512
Ah, Cecilia.
Um... You're hurting me.

1:03:40.555 --> 1:03:43.123
- I'm not who she says I am...
- You're really...

1:03:43.167 --> 1:03:45.256
- ..OK?
- OK. Just...you're hurting me.

1:03:45.299 --> 1:03:47.171
- Why don't you believe me?
- Please let me go.

1:03:47.214 --> 1:03:49.826
Please let go.

1:03:53.220 --> 1:03:55.962
- I'm a good person, OK?
- OK.

1:03:57.181 --> 1:03:59.052
- OK.
- OK, look.

1:03:59.096 --> 1:04:02.142
Trace, hey, I'm sorry, OK?
I just feel like -

1:04:02.186 --> 1:04:04.797
Cecilia! Just...

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.364
Sorry.

1:04:06.407 --> 1:04:08.409
That's OK.

1:04:08.453 --> 1:04:10.020
- I didn't mean -
- It's OK.

1:04:10.063 --> 1:04:11.804
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just, um...

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:14.154
- I really didn't mean it.
- Let's just step outside.

1:04:14.198 --> 1:04:15.416
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:17.288
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's get some fresh air.

1:04:17.331 --> 1:04:18.637
- And...
- OK, I...

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:20.813
Let's just talk.
Let's just talk outside.

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:22.902
- Alright.
- We'll figure this out, yeah?

1:04:22.946 --> 1:04:24.512
- Yeah.
- OK?

1:04:30.692 --> 1:04:32.912
Sissy!

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:34.696
Sissy!

1:05:48.466 --> 1:05:54.080
Time to destination,
four hours and twenty minutes.

1:06:03.350 --> 1:06:05.352
Hey! Hey!

1:06:05.396 --> 1:06:07.311
Stop.

1:06:09.487 --> 1:06:11.184
Oh, my God.

1:06:11.228 --> 1:06:14.100
Cecilia, thank you so much
for finding me.

1:06:19.584 --> 1:06:24.023
Dude, I thought that
I was gonna die out here.

1:06:24.067 --> 1:06:26.286
No-one's answering
their phones.

1:06:26.330 --> 1:06:28.158
Why is no-one answering?

1:06:31.161 --> 1:06:35.121
Whoa! Hold on a sec.

1:06:35.165 --> 1:06:36.862
I can't get this seatbelt
to work.

1:06:36.905 --> 1:06:38.995
In four kilometres,
turn right.

1:06:39.038 --> 1:06:41.998
Hey, I think the house is
back that way, you know?

1:06:42.041 --> 1:06:43.216
Where's Emma?

1:06:43.260 --> 1:06:46.872
- What, she's not at the house?
- Mm-mm.

1:06:46.915 --> 1:06:48.656
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:51.355
- Isn't that your job?
- Excuse me?

1:06:51.398 --> 1:06:53.052
Well, if you love her so much

1:06:53.096 --> 1:06:55.098
then why don't you know
where she is?

1:06:57.752 --> 1:06:59.667
Hey, are you OK?

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:04.368
Wait, Cecilia, calm down.

1:07:04.411 --> 1:07:08.981
Don't fucking tell me
to calm down, alright?

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:12.376
Calm down?
After the fucking day I've had?

1:07:12.419 --> 1:07:15.248
OK, I think you should
pull over and let me drive.

1:07:15.292 --> 1:07:16.858
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

1:07:16.902 --> 1:07:19.035
No, I... I don't
but if you could just slow down

1:07:19.078 --> 1:07:22.777
because my seatbelt -
I can't get my seatbelt on.

1:07:26.433 --> 1:07:28.522
OK, but can you just slow down?

1:07:28.566 --> 1:07:30.959
Cecilia, what's happening?
Where are we going?

1:07:31.003 --> 1:07:34.441
Everything's fucked, OK?
That's what's happening.

1:07:36.443 --> 1:07:38.097
Cecilia, stop the car.

1:07:38.141 --> 1:07:40.099
It was supposed to be
me and Emma,

1:07:40.143 --> 1:07:41.970
like, that was supposed
to be us.

1:07:42.014 --> 1:07:44.451
That was our pact.

1:07:44.495 --> 1:07:45.800
Stop the car.

1:07:45.844 --> 1:07:47.715
And we were gonna
make our kids fall in love.

1:07:47.759 --> 1:07:50.109
I don't know what's going on
but could you just slow down -

1:07:50.153 --> 1:07:52.329
And we were gonna like move
into the same nursing home

1:07:52.372 --> 1:07:53.895
when we were too old to pretend
that we cared

1:07:53.939 --> 1:07:55.245
about anyone else
but each other.

1:07:55.288 --> 1:07:56.420
Cecilia, what's going on?

1:07:56.463 --> 1:07:58.117
Slow down. I'm here for you.
We can...

1:07:58.161 --> 1:08:01.642
It was gonna be really cute
and like...

1:08:01.686 --> 1:08:04.297
- Like we promised each other.
- Cecilia.

1:08:04.341 --> 1:08:07.257
I just need you to slow down
and we're gonna solve this -

1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:10.999
And we promised each other
that we were gonna do that.

1:08:11.043 --> 1:08:12.958
- OK.

1:08:13.001 --> 1:08:14.394
- Just... I really...

1:08:14.438 --> 1:08:16.396
Stop the car.
I'm gonna drive, OK?

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:18.485
- I'm gonna drive.

1:08:18.529 --> 1:08:22.141
But I guess none of that's
gonna happen now, isn't it?

1:08:22.185 --> 1:08:23.621
- None of that's gonna happen.
- Cecilia, slow down.

1:08:23.664 --> 1:08:25.362
'Cause you're gonna
fuck off to America

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:27.233
and I'm never gonna
see her again.

1:08:27.277 --> 1:08:31.150
- How the fuck is that fair?
- Stop the car!

1:08:31.194 --> 1:08:33.239
I mean, why do you get
that kind of life

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:35.198
and I'm still
so fucking lonely

1:08:35.241 --> 1:08:37.156
and you don't even know
where she is right now!

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:38.984
- Fiancée of the fucking year!
- Stop the car!

1:08:39.027 --> 1:08:40.899
STOP!

1:08:48.559 --> 1:08:52.476
In three kilometres,
turn right.

1:10:26.918 --> 1:10:30.487
Why'd you do that, Fran?

1:10:31.923 --> 1:10:37.320
Hey! Hey! Hey, it's OK.

1:10:39.452 --> 1:10:42.020
It's OK, it's OK.

1:10:45.502 --> 1:10:47.330
It's the...

1:10:47.373 --> 1:10:49.723
Huh? Huh?

1:10:49.767 --> 1:10:51.682
It's the humane thing to do.

1:11:02.475 --> 1:11:05.435
It's the humane thing to do.

1:11:05.478 --> 1:11:07.828
What?

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:10.309
It's the humane thing to do.

1:11:10.353 --> 1:11:12.050
What?

1:11:12.093 --> 1:11:16.272
It's the humane thing to do.

1:11:16.315 --> 1:11:19.492
- It's the humane thing to do.

1:11:19.536 --> 1:11:21.277
What?

1:14:12.186 --> 1:14:14.232
Phone!

1:14:29.552 --> 1:14:31.510
Senior Constable Martindale.

1:14:34.252 --> 1:14:36.384
Is that you, Gaz?

1:14:37.777 --> 1:14:39.300
I told you to stop calling here

1:14:39.344 --> 1:14:42.478
when you're
fucked off your head. Huh?

1:14:42.521 --> 1:14:43.914
Yeah, yeah, boo-hoo.

1:14:43.957 --> 1:14:46.351
Just sober up, alright,
ya bloody drunk.

1:14:46.394 --> 1:14:47.831
And, mate, I'm not kidding.

1:14:47.874 --> 1:14:49.963
I'm this close to kicking
you off the netball team.

1:14:50.007 --> 1:14:51.225
Ahem!

1:14:57.797 --> 1:15:00.931
What the fuck are you doing
out in the sticks?

1:15:06.414 --> 1:15:08.808
Ah, this is
the Police Department.

1:15:08.852 --> 1:15:10.984
Is this, ah, an emergency?

1:15:11.028 --> 1:15:13.421
We've got your location here,
mate.

1:15:15.293 --> 1:15:17.338
Shit.

1:15:35.008 --> 1:15:36.749
Emma!

1:15:42.494 --> 1:15:44.627
Emma!

1:15:50.023 --> 1:15:52.548
Hey, Emma.

1:16:32.109 --> 1:16:35.242
CECILIA'S VOICE: Now would be
a great time to meditate

1:16:35.286 --> 1:16:37.462
but first I just wanted
to remind us all

1:16:37.505 --> 1:16:39.812
about the power
of kindness.

1:16:42.380 --> 1:16:44.600
Sissy,
the sissy!

1:16:44.643 --> 1:16:47.037
Sissy, the sissy!

1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:48.952
Sissy, the sissy!

1:16:48.995 --> 1:16:51.824
Sissy, the sissy!

1:16:51.868 --> 1:16:54.305
Come on, Sissy.

1:16:55.436 --> 1:16:57.917
Don't be a sissy.

1:17:18.242 --> 1:17:20.984
Get it done.

1:18:08.771 --> 1:18:11.425
Please... Please help me.

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:15.778
Alexandra Kutis has killed
three of my friends,

1:18:15.821 --> 1:18:17.127
maybe more.

1:18:17.170 --> 1:18:21.000
And she's coming for me too.
Please, send help.

1:18:21.044 --> 1:18:22.915
Please. Please.

1:18:43.849 --> 1:18:45.895
YOUNG EMMA'S VOICE: Sissy?

1:18:50.856 --> 1:18:53.119
Sissy.

1:18:53.163 --> 1:18:55.208
Sissy.

1:18:55.252 --> 1:18:57.820
Cecilia.

1:18:57.863 --> 1:18:59.909
Cecilia.

1:18:59.952 --> 1:19:02.912
Cecilia.
Cecilia?

1:19:02.955 --> 1:19:05.741
Cecilia!
What happened?

1:19:07.003 --> 1:19:08.918
OK, don't move. Don't.

1:19:08.961 --> 1:19:10.876
Don't move.
Don't move. Just stay there.

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.139
- Stay there.
- OK.

1:19:16.839 --> 1:19:18.536
Fuck!

1:19:21.626 --> 1:19:23.454
Alex?

1:19:23.497 --> 1:19:24.716
Babe?

1:19:26.762 --> 1:19:29.765
What the fuck!

1:19:29.808 --> 1:19:31.679
Towels?

1:20:08.064 --> 1:20:09.979
What the...

1:20:17.595 --> 1:20:20.859
Oh, my God! Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh, fuck!

1:20:20.903 --> 1:20:22.426
What the fuck?

1:20:22.469 --> 1:20:24.254
What the fuck?

1:20:26.038 --> 1:20:28.606
No! No!

1:20:30.390 --> 1:20:32.610
Fuck!

1:20:32.653 --> 1:20:34.612
Fuck! Tracey!

1:20:50.933 --> 1:20:54.545
Oh, shit. Shit.

1:20:59.724 --> 1:21:02.422
Emma, please,
I'm really scared.

1:21:05.034 --> 1:21:06.644
She went crazy.

1:21:06.687 --> 1:21:09.690
- She... She tried to kill me.
- Who?

1:21:09.734 --> 1:21:11.605
Alex.

1:21:14.913 --> 1:21:17.873
I'm so sorry.

1:21:17.916 --> 1:21:20.963
Fuck, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

1:21:21.006 --> 1:21:23.356
I mean, if I wasn't here,

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:25.315
none of this would have
happened.

1:21:31.321 --> 1:21:33.062
Fuck.

1:21:38.894 --> 1:21:40.634
Um...

1:21:40.678 --> 1:21:43.028
..where's Fran?

1:21:44.203 --> 1:21:46.553
I don't know.

1:21:57.608 --> 1:22:00.480
Cecilia, um...

1:22:00.524 --> 1:22:03.701
..I think it might be time
to call the police.

1:22:06.008 --> 1:22:07.792
No, no, no.

1:22:07.835 --> 1:22:10.403
Nuh. Mm-mm.
There's no time.

1:22:10.447 --> 1:22:12.884
There's no time.
We have to go.

1:22:12.928 --> 1:22:15.974
Come on.
We have to go.

1:22:16.018 --> 1:22:17.889
Come on.

1:22:22.546 --> 1:22:25.592
Emma, come on. Come on.
Just come with me.

1:22:25.636 --> 1:22:27.116
Come...

1:22:49.094 --> 1:22:51.314
It was an accident.

1:22:52.532 --> 1:22:54.621
You were a child.

1:22:54.665 --> 1:22:57.189
You didn't know
what you were doing.

1:22:59.104 --> 1:23:03.891
You are a really good person,
Cecilia.

1:23:03.935 --> 1:23:06.894
And I'm really glad you came.

1:23:06.938 --> 1:23:11.725
So I would like for you
to stop punishing yourself

1:23:11.769 --> 1:23:13.205
and just have some fun
with me...

1:23:13.249 --> 1:23:14.990
We are
best friends...

1:23:15.033 --> 1:23:16.252
..OK?

1:23:16.295 --> 1:23:18.515
..because, well,
first of all

1:23:18.558 --> 1:23:22.301
we are absolutely the same

1:23:22.345 --> 1:23:26.088
and we have so much
in common.

1:23:26.131 --> 1:23:27.828
Oh, my gosh.

1:23:28.786 --> 1:23:31.006
We were so young.

1:23:31.049 --> 1:23:33.660
Doesn't it feel like it was
yesterday?

1:23:33.704 --> 1:23:35.967
So crazy.

1:23:36.011 --> 1:23:38.361
But you know,
the more I think about it,

1:23:38.404 --> 1:23:42.104
the more I realise, like,
time is just a construct.

1:23:48.153 --> 1:23:51.852
Ooh, ooh, hold on.
I'm gonna show you something.

1:23:51.896 --> 1:23:55.030
Get ready, bitch.
It's gonna blow your mind.

1:23:57.771 --> 1:24:00.687
Do you love it?

1:24:00.731 --> 1:24:03.299
Matching! Sisters!

1:24:05.083 --> 1:24:07.346
Pink really is your colour.

1:24:07.390 --> 1:24:09.348
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
shut up!

1:24:09.392 --> 1:24:12.177
Deep blue sea, baby!

1:24:19.010 --> 1:24:20.707
What?

1:24:20.751 --> 1:24:23.971
Oh! You're fuckin' right.

1:24:24.015 --> 1:24:25.930
Let's get you some nail polish,
babe.

1:24:25.973 --> 1:24:29.194
- Mm!
- One second!

1:24:29.238 --> 1:24:31.762
Just hold on one minute,
OK?

1:24:35.505 --> 1:24:37.550
Did you put it in your bag
or something?

1:24:37.594 --> 1:24:41.685
It kinda just grew legs
and walked off!

1:24:41.728 --> 1:24:43.861
Hey, um, give me a second.

1:25:10.888 --> 1:25:13.673
Emma?

1:25:42.528 --> 1:25:45.009
Found it.

1:25:50.275 --> 1:25:52.321
Great! Still some left.

1:25:56.281 --> 1:25:57.500
Emma, what -

1:26:32.274 --> 1:26:33.884
Where's Fran?

1:26:35.581 --> 1:26:37.496
It... It was an accident.

1:26:37.540 --> 1:26:39.194
I just...

1:26:42.284 --> 1:26:44.460
I really didn't mean
to hurt her.

1:26:44.503 --> 1:26:47.114
Everything just kind of
spiralled out of control.

1:26:47.158 --> 1:26:49.204
Please don't hate me!

1:26:49.247 --> 1:26:51.728
No! No!

1:26:51.771 --> 1:26:54.513
No!

1:27:00.171 --> 1:27:02.304
No, no.

1:27:03.783 --> 1:27:06.612
- Oh, gosh.
- Hey.

1:27:06.656 --> 1:27:09.398
OK, look.

1:27:09.441 --> 1:27:11.922
I think we can
get through this.

1:27:21.105 --> 1:27:23.542
You're a fucking monster.

1:27:23.586 --> 1:27:28.286
You're a fucking, psychotic,
little, fucked-up monster.

1:27:28.330 --> 1:27:30.332
You always have been
and you always fucking will be.

1:27:30.375 --> 1:27:32.421
I'm a good person.
You said that!

1:27:32.464 --> 1:27:34.727
You fucking said that!

1:27:36.903 --> 1:27:39.384
Shit, Emma.

1:27:39.428 --> 1:27:41.778
What are you doing?

1:27:41.821 --> 1:27:43.997
Emma, no! No!

1:27:52.267 --> 1:27:54.834
You're the fucking monster!

1:27:58.055 --> 1:28:01.188
I mean, did you ever
even really like me?

1:28:03.669 --> 1:28:06.542
Or did you just get some
kind of like sick pleasure

1:28:06.585 --> 1:28:08.979
out of pitying me?

1:28:28.607 --> 1:28:32.176
You just care so much
what people think about you.

1:28:34.047 --> 1:28:35.397
Can't stand the thought

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:40.097
that maybe someone might
think you're weird.

1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:43.535
They might know the real you.

1:28:43.579 --> 1:28:46.103
Might find out you
have a heartbeat

1:28:46.146 --> 1:28:48.932
or feelings or a fucking soul.

1:28:51.151 --> 1:28:53.066
I'm real.

1:28:53.110 --> 1:28:56.331
And if that makes me a sissy,
then so what?

1:28:56.374 --> 1:28:58.594
Great.

1:28:58.637 --> 1:29:00.726
- I'm proud of that.
- Help. I need help.

1:29:00.770 --> 1:29:02.249
My friends are missing.

1:29:02.293 --> 1:29:04.991
My address is...

1:29:05.035 --> 1:29:06.906
Please, I need help.

1:29:08.821 --> 1:29:10.736
You know, it's people like you

1:29:10.780 --> 1:29:12.216
that make the rest of us
feel like shit.

1:29:12.259 --> 1:29:14.044
Emergency.
Police, fire or ambulance?

1:29:14.087 --> 1:29:15.524
Police.

1:29:15.567 --> 1:29:17.830
- Are you in a safe location?
- No. No, I'm not safe.

1:29:17.874 --> 1:29:19.832
Please help, please help.
Please come.

1:30:37.954 --> 1:30:39.869
Thank you.

1:30:41.697 --> 1:30:44.351
Thank you.

1:30:49.095 --> 1:30:50.662
Em!

1:32:06.521 --> 1:32:08.479
Hey!

1:32:10.263 --> 1:32:13.005
Hey.

1:32:18.228 --> 1:32:22.319
Are... Are you...
Are you alright, love?

1:32:22.362 --> 1:32:24.582
Mm-hm.

1:32:24.626 --> 1:32:28.281
Alright, is there anyone else
in the house?

1:32:28.325 --> 1:32:30.501
Alright, you just...
You stay there, alright?

1:32:30.545 --> 1:32:32.198
You... You...
You're safe there.

1:32:32.242 --> 1:32:34.549
I'm gonna...

1:32:36.333 --> 1:32:38.857
I'm gonna secure the house, OK?

1:32:38.901 --> 1:32:40.772
And I'll be back.

1:32:44.384 --> 1:32:46.169
Yep.

1:32:49.694 --> 1:32:52.784
Oh, my God.

1:32:52.828 --> 1:32:54.830
Oh, my God.

1:33:01.619 --> 1:33:04.404
Fuck me.

1:33:04.448 --> 1:33:08.147
You got this.
Yeah, you're a weapon.

1:33:32.084 --> 1:33:33.782
And this is Sissy,

1:33:33.825 --> 1:33:36.915
my best friend
in the whole wide world.

1:33:36.959 --> 1:33:39.657
This is you
when you were a baby!

1:34:11.036 --> 1:34:14.126
Hi, guys, welcome
to my channel.

1:34:14.170 --> 1:34:16.259
My name's Sissy and this
is my best friend, Emma,

1:34:16.302 --> 1:34:17.956
and today is her 13th birthday.

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:21.699
You're officially old enough
to be a child bride.

1:34:21.743 --> 1:34:24.659
Speak for yourself. I'm gonna
be so cool when I'm older.

1:34:24.702 --> 1:34:27.139
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

1:34:27.183 --> 1:34:30.752
I'm gonna have pink hair
and drive an old yellow car.

1:34:30.795 --> 1:34:31.970
Your turn.

1:34:32.014 --> 1:34:33.668
Who do you want to be
when you grow up?

1:34:33.711 --> 1:34:37.280
Tell all the fans at home.
They're dying to know.

1:34:37.323 --> 1:34:38.977
I don't know.

1:34:41.023 --> 1:34:43.416
I don't really want to grow up.

1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:46.506
I don't want anything
to change.

1:34:46.550 --> 1:34:48.378
I want to stay like this
forever.

1:34:48.421 --> 1:34:50.989
Boring!

1:35:09.181 --> 1:35:11.880
I am loved.

1:35:11.923 --> 1:35:14.099
I am special.

1:35:14.143 --> 1:35:16.754
I am enough.

1:35:16.798 --> 1:35:19.235
I am doing my best.

1:35:19.278 --> 1:35:21.541
We all are.

1:35:22.804 --> 1:35:27.112
And now we take our rope

1:35:27.156 --> 1:35:32.074
and we lay it around us
like so.

1:35:32.117 --> 1:35:37.296
And as always when we form
a circle around ourselves

1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:41.648
we are reminded that we carry
with us an invisible boundary.

1:35:41.692 --> 1:35:44.651
No-one enters that boundary
but us.

1:35:44.695 --> 1:35:47.176
It's our very own safe space

1:35:47.219 --> 1:35:51.354
and we never, ever
have to leave it.

1:35:55.097 --> 1:35:56.794
When I was the lone survivor

1:35:56.838 --> 1:35:59.362
of the Alexandra Kutis
massacre...

1:36:01.581 --> 1:36:04.628
..my boundary was all I had.

1:36:04.671 --> 1:36:08.763
When I hid in that bathroom
as Alex murdered my friends...

1:36:11.026 --> 1:36:13.506
..honestly, I...

1:36:15.378 --> 1:36:18.511
..I wanted to give up.

1:36:18.555 --> 1:36:21.036
I wanted it to be over.

1:36:26.911 --> 1:36:29.566
But then I thought of
all of you

1:36:29.609 --> 1:36:32.874
and I realised
I had to be strong.

1:36:34.876 --> 1:36:38.488
I had to practise
what I preach, you know?

1:36:38.531 --> 1:36:41.491
So I did The Steps.

1:36:41.534 --> 1:36:46.583
I came back into my body,
regained control of my mind

1:36:46.626 --> 1:36:49.238
and refused to be a victim.

1:36:52.197 --> 1:36:53.764
And now you can too.

1:36:53.808 --> 1:36:55.635
Order my new book,

1:36:55.679 --> 1:37:00.858
Don't Survive, Thrive: Simple
Steps to Living Your Best Life.

1:37:00.902 --> 1:37:04.427
And, even better,

1:37:04.470 --> 1:37:07.343
all of my friends,
all ten million of you,

1:37:07.386 --> 1:37:10.563
will receive one of my new,
bespoke,

1:37:10.607 --> 1:37:14.002
non-allergenic therapy ropes.

1:37:14.045 --> 1:37:15.264
