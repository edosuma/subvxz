00:10.440 --> 00:12.879
They needed to send a message.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.556
Turning into a girl, does it
cause sexual confusion?

00:16.620 --> 00:18.599
They all got their powers before me.
That's all he had left.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.519
This girl he turns into,
would you fuck her?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.239
We've never seen her.

00:25.240 --> 00:25.759
Shit!

00:25.760 --> 00:27.879
We can't get caught,
we're on probation.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.879
Didn't take you long did it?
Congratulations.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.839
What d'you say?

01:39.840 --> 01:43.839
I said do you miss it, the running?

01:44.240 --> 01:47.559
Ain't nothing I can do about it,
is there?

01:47.560 --> 01:49.119
Why you even asking?

01:49.120 --> 01:53.119
You're in a good mood!

03:35.240 --> 03:38.679
Hey, you ran an 11.9.
That's quick. That's very quick.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.439
Who's your coach?

03:40.440 --> 03:41.599
I haven't got one.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.599
You should have one. Just think
what you could achieve.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.919
I just want to run.
I'm not interested in anything else.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.919
OK. It's your call.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.799
Hi. Hi.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.119
I'm Emma.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.919
And you're?

04:03.920 --> 04:07.919
Mel... issa.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.799
I'm one of the losers
you thrashed out there.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.959
Looks like we'll have
to up our game.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.399
I should go.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.399
(WHISTLES)

04:29.520 --> 04:31.919
The toilets are out of order.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.159
So you piss in a sink?

04:33.160 --> 04:37.039
Yeah, I was going to piss in like
a bottle or the vending machine,

04:37.040 --> 04:41.039
but this seemed more civilised.
I'm not a complete caveman!

04:43.720 --> 04:46.519
Oh.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.439
Do we know each other?

04:48.440 --> 04:50.359
I don't think so.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.999
Now that is a tragedy.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.999
We should really do something
about it.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.199
Move!

05:12.000 --> 05:15.999
Imagine being up
to your balls in there.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.919
What can I get you?

05:27.920 --> 05:31.919
Vodka and coke. Double.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.279
You're Curtis Donovan, aren't you?

05:36.280 --> 05:39.199
I'm doing the training camp
at the Community Centre.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.359
Saw you doing
Community Service.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.239
Right.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.639
So is that for drugs?

05:45.640 --> 05:48.279
Nah.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.599
Something else.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.599
That's four quid.

05:56.280 --> 06:00.279
This is going to make me
sound totally sad, but...

06:01.280 --> 06:05.279
I used to love to watch you run.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.519
You were so focused,
like there was nothing else.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.479
It's not cool, I know. I said it.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.879
Thanks.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.479
I thought you'd be off the alcohol
and that since you're training?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.279
You sound like my coach.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.919
He says I've got to take
my running more seriously.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.919
I remember that! Your whole life
becomes the training.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.279
You say it like you enjoyed it.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.799
You're one of those people.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.239
What do you call them? They get
off on being spanked...

06:39.240 --> 06:40.279
Perverts?

06:40.280 --> 06:44.279
No. Masochists. I'm not saying
you do like being spanked.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.239
Maybe you do.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.119
Not sure where
I was going with that!

06:51.120 --> 06:53.799
Where are you staying?

06:53.800 --> 06:57.799
Some student halls of residence.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.319
So what is there to do around here?

07:14.360 --> 07:18.359
You should do the lottery.
Use your power. See the numbers.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.799
Stick it to them.
We'll split it, 50:50.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.719
Why should I split it with you?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.479
Because it was my idea, you!

07:25.480 --> 07:29.359
I'm the brains, you're the stare.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.039
OK. 60:50.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.519
It's supposed to add up to 100.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.199
Whoa, don't you even think
about screwing me, sweet cheeks!

07:39.200 --> 07:40.759
70:40. Final offer.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.199
I don't get to choose what I see.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.639
Ah!

07:44.640 --> 07:48.639
Fine! 80:30. But I feel like I've
been raped, and not in a good way.

07:52.080 --> 07:52.799
What're you smiling at?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.599
What? Am I not allowed to smile?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.119
You look like you just got laid.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.719
Did you just have a shag?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.119
Something like that.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.519
So who's the lucky girl?

08:02.520 --> 08:06.519
You don't know her.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.719
Piece of shit!

08:17.720 --> 08:20.959
It won't start. I don't know
why I opened the bonnet.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.839
No idea what I'm looking at.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.919
Want me to look?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.519
What you know about cars?

08:24.520 --> 08:28.519
I know about electronics, cos I'm a
fucking rocket scientist, aren't I?

08:39.440 --> 08:41.599
Try it now.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.719
ENGINE STARTS

08:44.720 --> 08:48.719
Thanks. You want a lift?

08:49.160 --> 08:52.119
Look, you've already
undermined my masculinity.

08:52.120 --> 08:56.119
At least let me drive you somewhere.
Get in.

08:57.200 --> 08:57.839
Where to?

08:57.840 --> 09:01.839
There.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.959
Thanks for the lift.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.839
Any time. I owe you.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.759
Well you can give us
a new power if you want.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.679
I don't owe you that much.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.679
Right, see you around.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.159
Mind if I run with you?

09:40.160 --> 09:44.159
Yeah, I do.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.439
You fancy going to
for a drink sometime?

09:56.360 --> 10:00.359
How about dinner? Hmm?

10:02.040 --> 10:05.999
Jesus!

10:06.000 --> 10:09.999
Catch you on the next lap, yeah?

10:11.080 --> 10:13.279
You look like you had a late one?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.559
You'll never guess who
I met last night.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.679
Who?

10:16.680 --> 10:19.679
Curtis Donovan. Remember him?

10:19.680 --> 10:22.319
Sprinting guy that
got banned for drugs?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.719
Right. So what's he like?

10:24.720 --> 10:28.719
Well, I thought he was cute.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.239
Then we went back to his.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.279
By the time my ban's over,
it'll be too late.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.599
No decent coach will want
to work with me.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.799
All the guys I trained with,
I was way better than them.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.719
He was so negative. Talk about
feeling sorry for yourself!

10:43.720 --> 10:47.599
Running's the only thing
I was ever really good at.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.119
The only thing that made
me feel good about myself.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.079
It's like he blames everyone
else for what happened to him.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.119
I had to kiss him just
to shut him up!

10:56.120 --> 10:58.279
I ended up giving him
a sympathy shag.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.279
What do you mean?

11:04.120 --> 11:08.119
Big mistake.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.439
The guy is clueless.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.199
It was some of the worst sex
I have ever had.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.119
I have to warm down.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.719
Good work today.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.439
Hey, walking back to the Community
Centre? I'll walk with you.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.879
What d'you want?

11:44.880 --> 11:47.519
I want you to come for
a drink with me.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.759
Just one drink.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.359
I'm not interested, OK?

11:50.360 --> 11:54.359
You don't know what you're missing.
I know how to please a woman.

11:56.760 --> 12:00.239
Take your fucking hand off my arse
before I break it!

12:00.240 --> 12:04.239
Oh, my mistake.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.199
Lesbian!

12:11.800 --> 12:12.639
Hi.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.639
Hi.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.719
Look, about last night...

12:19.720 --> 12:22.519
It's all right.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.519
We were both drunk.
Let's just forget it ever happened.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.439
I should get changed.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.279
Ho-ho-ho!

12:37.280 --> 12:39.639
Oh, that were brutal, weren't it?

12:39.640 --> 12:43.079
That were like watching someone
fist a baby lamb.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.799
She just took a huge shit
in your mouth!

12:45.800 --> 12:46.919
Shut the fuck up, man!

12:46.920 --> 12:48.279
All right.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.799
Look, it happens to all of us.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.799
Women are cruel and insensitive,
and they are hurtful.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.679
But they're so beautiful.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.679
They smell really nice.
They smell like...

13:10.200 --> 13:14.199
Toffee apples.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.319
Can I ask you something?

13:26.320 --> 13:29.599
When we were together. Was I...?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.799
What?

13:32.800 --> 13:35.039
Was I all right?

13:35.040 --> 13:37.719
You know, the sex stuff?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.719
We couldn't actually touch
each other, so...

13:40.720 --> 13:43.439
No, what we could do.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.039
Was I shit?

13:45.040 --> 13:46.479
No.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.919
That's one of those nos
that means yes.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.079
"No!" Fucking yes!

13:50.080 --> 13:51.999
No! What're you saying?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.199
I haven't said anything.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.319
You were thinking it.
Go on, I want to hear it.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.319
No, you don't!

14:00.720 --> 14:04.719
Is he better than me?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.119
What, him? He's better than me?!

14:09.120 --> 14:10.479
Don't talk about him like that!

14:10.480 --> 14:12.119
Oh, man!

14:12.120 --> 14:14.279
When we're doing it,
he's focused on me.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.399
What, and I wasn't?

14:15.400 --> 14:17.159
You just spent a lot of time
watching yourself.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.999
That's bullshit!

14:19.000 --> 14:22.999
Oh, really?
Look, you were like this.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.119
You done?

14:35.120 --> 14:38.959
Look, this is the reason why girls
never tell boys this stuff.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.199
Your egos can't take it.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.359
Oh, so that's another thing
wrong with me?

14:42.360 --> 14:43.759
Oh, here we go!

14:43.760 --> 14:44.999
What's that supposed to mean?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.719
It's like there's this big fucking
cloud hanging over your head.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.839
There ain't no cloud!

14:49.840 --> 14:53.119
Oh really? "My life's shit!
Everything's shit!

14:53.120 --> 14:56.359
I shouldn't even be here!"

14:56.360 --> 15:05.999
Look, if you don't want to hear it,
don't ask.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.919
I haven't got anything to wear.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.399
I'll lend you something.
About the same size.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.039
C'mon.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.279
Go out with me.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.639
All right.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.599
Guys, drugs test.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.599
I'm going to need a urine sample
from both of you.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.879
Oh, shit!

16:27.880 --> 16:31.879
Oh, fuck!

16:32.440 --> 16:36.439
Oh!

16:49.000 --> 16:52.999
I had some trouble with my aim.

16:59.720 --> 17:03.719
CAR DOOR OPENS

17:06.960 --> 17:10.959
Come here.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.878
Where are you going?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.439
What's he doing?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.399
I don't know.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.719
So d'you want to tell me
what's going on?

17:35.720 --> 17:36.999
Why're we following him?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.999
Cos I want to know
what he's doing.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.519
Kelly!

17:52.320 --> 17:56.319
What's going on?

18:03.120 --> 18:07.119
Oh, my God.
You fancy him, don't you?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.799
You totally fancy him.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.279
Shut up!

18:12.280 --> 18:16.279
He is really fit.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.719
So who's the dead girl, then?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.279
What're you doing?

18:37.280 --> 18:41.279
That's Curtis' locker.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.439
It's me. Curtis.
This is how I look when I'm a girl.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.239
What're you doing?

18:47.240 --> 18:49.119
I'm running again.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.839
You're running?

18:50.840 --> 18:51.999
Like this?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.039
It's the only way I can compete.
You can't tell anyone.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.759
Not even Alisha.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.719
C'mon, man. I need this.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.479
All right.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.199
Do me a favour.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.919
Zip me up.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.919
I don't know how you're supposed to
do these things up yourself.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.879
It's fucking weird, man.

19:24.240 --> 19:28.239
Don't tell anyone about this, yeah?

20:24.680 --> 20:28.679
I can't believe
you don't have a boyfriend.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.719
You're so beautiful.

20:32.720 --> 20:36.719
I don't really have time, with all
the training and everything.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.719
Are you gay?

20:41.720 --> 20:44.399
Why d'you say that?

20:44.400 --> 20:46.039
I see how you look at me.

20:46.040 --> 20:50.039
It's like how a boy looks at me when
he wants to get into my knickers.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.039
I like it.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.159
Have you ever been
with a girl before?

21:07.160 --> 21:10.839
It's OK.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.839

Ah...

21:55.360 --> 21:59.359
(PANTS)

22:08.600 --> 22:12.599
Being out with her,
it's like we connected.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.479
We just talked.

22:14.480 --> 22:17.039
There was no bullshit. Like...

22:17.040 --> 22:18.719
I could just be myself.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.159
But you weren't yourself.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.959
She's not interested in me as a guy.
I tried that.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.319
It's different.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.479
Maybe I'm different.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.599
Why can't it be like that with her
when I'm me?

22:31.600 --> 22:35.439
We think differently to them.

22:35.440 --> 22:39.039
Girls.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.159
That's not all.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.439
The sex...

22:42.440 --> 22:45.399
You ain't lived until
you've had a multiple orgasm.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.319
Guys are getting short-changed.
Ours is all, "Uh! Pth."

22:49.320 --> 22:51.079
Their's...

22:51.080 --> 22:55.079
The slow build up,
then it's like...

22:55.560 --> 22:59.559
all through your body, ha,
like waves of pleasure.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.639
Are you a lesbian?

23:01.640 --> 23:04.359
What? No! No.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.999
When I'm her, I'm still me and...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.759
and I like girls,
so I guess she does, too.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.679
So she is a lesbian?

23:12.680 --> 23:16.679
I don't think there's
an official term for this shit.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.959
So what're you going to do?

23:23.520 --> 23:27.519
I don't want to stop seeing her.

VENDING MACHINE CLATTERS

23:38.880 --> 23:39.959
Hi.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.559
Hi.

23:43.560 --> 23:47.559
How I was with you...
the other night...

23:49.040 --> 23:50.959
being all negative.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.959
That's not how I want to be.

23:55.240 --> 23:59.239
I guess I need
to work some shit out.

24:01.080 --> 24:05.079
I'm sorry.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.599
Hiya.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.959
I hear you girls are having a bit
of a party tonight. I was er...

24:42.960 --> 24:44.719
thinking we should probably
go together.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.039
I'm already going.

24:46.040 --> 24:50.039
And I will see you there.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.879
I am definitely in there, mate.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.439
And the nice thing is,
she's already seen my cock,

24:56.440 --> 24:58.079
and she's still up for it, so...

24:58.080 --> 24:58.919
How come she's seen your cock?

24:58.920 --> 25:00.519
She caught me pissing in a sink.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.479
It's all worked out very nicely.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.479
Mm!

25:05.480 --> 25:09.479
Hey.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.599
What?

25:19.600 --> 25:23.599
Nothing.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.599
OK, I'll see you later.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.599
Is that painful?

25:47.600 --> 25:51.599
I've just tweaked a muscle.

25:52.800 --> 25:56.799
Let me take a look.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.359
You're very tight.

26:07.200 --> 26:11.199
The muscle's all knotted.

26:17.800 --> 26:21.799
We can't have you cramping up now,
can we?

26:26.920 --> 26:27.959
Ah!

26:27.960 --> 26:29.839
You OK?

26:29.840 --> 26:32.519
Yeah.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.742
It feels better.
I'm going to take a shower.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.879
Mel? Hi. Drink?

27:25.961 --> 27:27.000
Go on.

27:27.001 --> 27:28.600
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

27:28.601 --> 27:29.680
No training tomorrow.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.720
Thanks.

27:32.721 --> 27:35.920
Listen, we should talk about fixing
you up with some more training.

27:35.921 --> 27:39.920
One on one. I think you could
really benefit from it.

27:40.281 --> 27:41.520
OK, yeah.

27:41.521 --> 27:44.920
Maybe we should go somewhere a bit
quieter and talk about it properly.

27:44.921 --> 27:48.200
Can we talk about this
some other time?

27:48.201 --> 27:52.200
Thanks for the drink.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.120
Hey! You made it.

27:57.121 --> 27:58.680
Why are you looking at my tits?

27:58.681 --> 28:02.080
Hello!
They're just there, aren't they?

28:02.081 --> 28:04.200
They're very nice, they're perky.
It's a reflex.

28:04.201 --> 28:08.200
Drink up. We're dancing.

28:09.281 --> 28:12.200
You have yourself a little dance
and I'll get you a drink in.

28:12.201 --> 28:16.200
Oh, yeah.

29:36.801 --> 29:40.800
How much have you had to drink?

29:41.721 --> 29:44.120
I'm going to take you home, OK?

30:20.681 --> 30:23.440
Are you sure that's a good idea?

30:23.441 --> 30:27.440
It's just that you seem a bit
out of it and... Oh!

30:27.761 --> 30:31.760
Ohh, OK!

30:32.121 --> 30:35.440
Yeah, I'll wait outside.

It's not generally
a spectator sport.

30:58.121 --> 30:59.400
I thought it was you!

30:59.401 --> 31:03.400
Is that why
you were calling me "Emma"?

31:03.641 --> 31:07.000
Emma! Wait!

31:07.001 --> 31:08.240
(CHOKES)

31:08.241 --> 31:12.240

stuck in my throat here.

31:18.281 --> 31:19.600
I need to find Emma.

31:19.601 --> 31:22.520
OK. We'll find her.

31:22.521 --> 31:26.520
C'mon.

31:50.001 --> 31:54.000
Just relax.

33:20.961 --> 33:23.200
You know,
when you think you know someone,

33:23.201 --> 33:27.200
then they turn out
to be something different?

33:28.441 --> 33:32.440
Fuck it.
I don't want to think about it.

33:40.041 --> 33:43.640
So, what've you been up to?

33:43.641 --> 33:47.640
Nothin'. Just hanging out.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.640
Oh...

33:52.641 --> 33:56.640
I don't think you really want this.

33:58.921 --> 33:59.920
Put your clothes on.

33:59.921 --> 34:01.320
What is your problem?

34:01.321 --> 34:02.880
Do you want to have sex with me,

34:02.881 --> 34:05.160
or is this a revenge fuck?
I don't want that.

34:05.161 --> 34:09.159
You don't need to do this.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.880
Put your clothes on.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.880
I was wrong about you.

34:19.481 --> 34:21.000
Have I messed things up?

34:21.001 --> 34:25.000
No.

34:52.761 --> 34:55.040
This is my dress.

34:55.041 --> 34:59.040
Why have you got my dress?
I lent this to Mel.

35:00.161 --> 35:01.320
You're shagging her?

35:01.321 --> 35:02.280
No, it's not what you think it is.

35:02.281 --> 35:05.720
So, what is it?
How did this get here?

35:05.780 --> 35:06.739
You're such a fucking prick.

35:06.740 --> 35:09.379
Wait, Emma!

35:09.662 --> 35:11.278
Emma?

35:21.681 --> 35:24.920
Emma found the dress she lent me.
She thinks I'm shagging Mel.

35:24.921 --> 35:27.040
She thinks you're shagging Mel?

35:27.041 --> 35:29.320
No.
She thinks Curtis is shagging Mel.

35:29.321 --> 35:32.240
But I thought you were
sleeping with Emma?

35:32.241 --> 35:35.520
I was, but then Emma came round last
night. She made a pass at me.

35:35.521 --> 35:36.960
She made a pass at you?

35:36.961 --> 35:39.920
No. She made a pass at Curtis.

35:39.921 --> 35:41.560
Isn't that what you wanted?

35:41.561 --> 35:43.960
Yeah, but then she found the dress
she lent me,

35:43.961 --> 35:47.760
now she thinks Mel's cheating
on her, with me.

35:47.761 --> 35:49.400
So who's with Emma?

35:49.401 --> 35:53.400
No-one.
She thinks I'm fucking myself!

35:57.241 --> 36:01.240
I'm gonna get dressed, yeah?

36:12.281 --> 36:14.840
Hey.

36:14.841 --> 36:18.840
Listen, about last night.
I guess we were both drunk.

36:19.201 --> 36:22.520
I only had that one drink...
that you gave me.

36:22.521 --> 36:25.240
Well, maybe it was just me then,

36:25.241 --> 36:29.240
seemed like some really
weird shit was going on.

36:30.601 --> 36:34.600
I think it would be best if neither
of us said anything about it.

36:35.081 --> 36:39.080
We both just forget about it, yeah?

36:51.121 --> 36:52.440
What's going on with you and Simon?

36:52.441 --> 36:53.640
What? Nothing.

36:53.641 --> 36:54.960
That's my mate's boyfriend,
so you stay away from him.

36:54.961 --> 36:56.320
Listen...

36:56.321 --> 36:57.600
What's all that?

36:57.601 --> 36:59.040
Nothing.

36:59.041 --> 37:03.000
It better be nothing.

37:03.001 --> 37:04.440
What's going on?

37:04.441 --> 37:07.200
It looks like she's
after your boyfriend.

37:07.201 --> 37:09.320
Fuck knows why.

37:09.321 --> 37:09.680
That's bullshit.

37:09.681 --> 37:11.600
He was zipping up your dress.

37:11.601 --> 37:13.960
You were sticking your arse out
and jiggling your tits.

37:14.047 --> 37:14.566
Is that true?

37:14.567 --> 37:16.486
It's not what you think.

37:16.487 --> 37:18.926
What is going on?!

37:18.927 --> 37:21.806
This here, is your fault.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.086
Were you flirting with him?

37:24.087 --> 37:25.166
No.

37:25.167 --> 37:26.526
Get your own boyfriend, you slut.

37:26.527 --> 37:28.166
I'm not a slut.

37:28.167 --> 37:29.886
You're fucking Curtis Donovan! No.

37:29.887 --> 37:31.526
You're shagging Curtis now?

37:31.527 --> 37:32.806
It isn't like that.

37:32.807 --> 37:36.006
Ow!

37:36.007 --> 37:40.006
Emma!

37:40.727 --> 37:42.606
She's got an attitude on her,
hasn't she?

37:42.607 --> 37:44.486
I've got an attitude?

37:44.487 --> 37:48.286
You're always staring at my tits.
You had your hands all over my arse.

37:48.287 --> 37:50.286
I was just being friendly.

37:50.287 --> 37:53.526
And you ask before you touch.

37:53.527 --> 37:56.486
All the groping, and staring...
the sleazy chat-up lines.

37:56.487 --> 38:00.486
You have no idea what
it's like to be a woman.

38:02.927 --> 38:04.926
What?!

38:04.927 --> 38:08.526
I think you got your period.

38:08.527 --> 38:12.526
No-one needs to see that.

38:21.807 --> 38:22.926
It's Curtis.

38:22.927 --> 38:25.606
Hmm?

38:25.607 --> 38:27.526
The girl.

38:27.527 --> 38:29.566
It's Curtis.

38:29.567 --> 38:30.686
(HE RETCHES)

38:30.687 --> 38:34.686
You're kidding?

38:35.687 --> 38:36.326
What is wrong with you?

38:36.327 --> 38:40.326
Nothing... wrong.

38:48.087 --> 38:51.606
Curtis?

38:51.607 --> 38:54.126
I know it's you. Are you all right?

38:54.127 --> 38:57.566
Oh, yeah. I'm great!

38:57.567 --> 39:01.566
D'you need a tampon?

39:02.087 --> 39:06.086
D'you need me to show you how to
shove it up there?

39:09.567 --> 39:13.566
I'm good, thanks.

39:14.407 --> 39:18.406
You need to put them
on a hot wash, mate.

39:26.247 --> 39:27.766
So what're you going to do?

39:27.767 --> 39:31.766
I'm going to tell Emma.

39:31.927 --> 39:35.926
Ain't nothing else I can do.

39:40.367 --> 39:44.366
KNOCK ON DOOR

39:47.487 --> 39:49.206
Hey. Are you all right?

39:49.207 --> 39:51.806
Yes, I just thought you
were someone else.

39:51.807 --> 39:54.966
Oh? Listen before you go.

39:54.967 --> 39:57.726
We should talk about fixing up
some more training.

39:57.727 --> 40:00.831
One on one.

40:28.294 --> 40:30.253
Emma?

40:30.254 --> 40:32.773
Hi!

40:32.774 --> 40:34.573
Erm, I'm looking for Emma.

40:34.574 --> 40:38.573
She's out for a drink
with her coach.

40:48.614 --> 40:52.613
Just relax.

42:14.014 --> 42:18.013
What the fuck is going on?
How did I get here?

42:18.574 --> 42:19.773
Mark spiked you.

42:19.774 --> 42:23.773
Don't worry, I stopped him
before he really did anything.

42:26.534 --> 42:27.613
Where is he?

42:27.614 --> 42:29.053
Tied up in the boot of the car.

42:29.054 --> 42:31.133
He did the same to me last night.

42:31.134 --> 42:34.453
He spiked me. That's why
I was so out of it.

42:34.454 --> 42:38.453
What're you talking about?

42:39.054 --> 42:43.053
There's something
I need to show you.

42:47.414 --> 42:49.453
Curtis isn't shagging me.

42:49.454 --> 42:53.453
He isn't cheating on you,
and neither am I.

42:58.534 --> 43:02.533
This is totally insane.

43:05.214 --> 43:08.893
I just wanted to run.

43:08.894 --> 43:12.893
To feel it again... to feel...

43:13.774 --> 43:17.213
good about myself.

43:17.214 --> 43:20.493
Being her...

43:20.494 --> 43:23.533
it was the only way I could do it.

43:23.534 --> 43:27.533
I never meant for any of
this to happen, to hurt you.

43:32.734 --> 43:36.733
Thought I wanted it more than
anything. It's not worth this.

43:40.934 --> 43:44.933
I need to find something else
that makes me feel like that.

44:03.254 --> 44:05.213
What should we do with him?

44:05.214 --> 44:09.213
(SCREAMING)

45:01.534 --> 45:04.013
It was you, you've done this to me.

45:04.014 --> 45:07.013
No-one needs to know about that.
Next time you find a girl

45:07.014 --> 45:09.453
unconscious, you don't touch her.
You get it?

45:09.454 --> 45:12.333
I was checking on you.
It was you that was grabbing me,

45:12.334 --> 45:14.853
kissing me, pushing my head down.
I don't like that.

45:14.854 --> 45:16.693
Who's the real victim?

45:16.694 --> 45:17.973
You never heard "no means no"?

45:17.974 --> 45:20.293
You didn't say no.
You said, "Suck my nipples."

45:20.294 --> 45:24.293
I was spiked. You didn't think it
was strange when I called you Emma?

45:24.614 --> 45:28.333
People say all kinds of
weird shit during sex.

45:28.334 --> 45:32.333
I was fucking this bird, one time,
right, about to blow my load,

45:32.334 --> 45:36.333
and I went
"Auntie!" What's that all about?

45:37.214 --> 45:38.533
You should've known.

45:38.534 --> 45:40.893
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

45:40.894 --> 45:43.973
That's one fine looking gift horse
you've got.

45:43.974 --> 45:47.973
(COUGHS)

45:48.174 --> 45:49.733
Ooh, I've got it.

45:49.734 --> 45:52.173
Eugh, is that a pube?

45:52.174 --> 45:55.533
Mmm! D'you want it back?

45:55.534 --> 45:56.573
Did you...?

45:56.574 --> 46:00.573
For a bloke,
he's got a lovely pussy.

46:01.494 --> 46:05.493
Fuck it.

46:20.814 --> 46:23.373
Why are you
so obsessed with becoming him?

46:23.374 --> 46:24.733
I have to save you.

46:24.734 --> 46:27.653
But if you become him,
you're gonna leave me.

46:27.654 --> 46:28.653
You're the guy in the mask!

46:28.654 --> 46:29.813
You can't tell anyone.

46:29.814 --> 46:31.293
You have a future self?

46:31.294 --> 46:32.733
It's my destiny.

46:32.734 --> 46:34.453
That is so fucking cool.

46:34.454 --> 46:38.373
Being a super hero and
having a girlfriend, they don't mix.

46:38.374 --> 46:41.373
Where the fuck have you been
the past few weeks?

46:41.374 --> 46:43.613
I don't know what's going on!

46:43.614 --> 46:45.493
Simon, wait!

46:45.494 --> 46:47.999
One day you'll come to see that
I did it all for you.
