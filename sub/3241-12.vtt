02:02.840 --> 02:06.606
(SNICKERS) Well, no.
Airplane wings are stationary.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.330
They don't flap.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.044
And you've ridden in one.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.722
Yes, several times.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.400
I love flying.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.170
JAMIE: How high can ye fly?

02:17.400 --> 02:18.925
CLAIRE: Well, I don't know exactly.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.681
Thousands of feet in the air, certainly.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.286
What? Thousands of feet?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.851
Must have God's own view
of the world from that height.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.447
It's amazing.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.282
Especially the first time you go up.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.089
I mean, everything you
can see on the ground,

02:34.200 --> 02:37.363
it just falls away, until it disappears.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.245
How old are you, Sassenach?

02:41.360 --> 02:42.885
I never thought to ask.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.408
- I'm 27.
- Oh.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.886
I always thought you were
about my age or younger.

There were rumors.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.450
Dougal told me afterward

that Randall had got Jenny

the one you're named after.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.841
Why?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.564
Why would you name him after me?

What's wrong, <i>a-graidh?</i>
Are you ill?

06:02.280 --> 06:06.080
Do you not think I've suffered enough
for what I let happen that

06:07.120 --> 06:08.963
ye must name Randall's bastard after me,

06:10.080 --> 06:11.605

06:31.080 --> 06:33.082
Correct me, brother, if I'm wrong,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.367
but I have a strong impression
you're saying that

06:35.440 --> 06:37.442
I played the whore to Captain Randall?

06:37.920 --> 06:41.208
I'd rather I was dead in my grave

06:44.480 --> 06:45.845
And whose is this one?

06:46.360 --> 06:48.966
To have you ruin yourself for me
was shame enough, but...

06:50.200 --> 06:52.931
Another one with no father
to give him a name?

06:53.360 --> 06:54.361
We shouldn't have come.

06:54.880 --> 06:55.961
Jamie, perhaps we should all go inside...

06:56.040 --> 06:58.202
Tell that trollop to keep her neb
out of my business.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.806
She's my wife
and you'll speak of her with respect.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.405
Jamie, please.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.086
Do I have to do what I did
when we were bairns?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.322
Grab ye by the bollocks to make ye
stand still and listen to me?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.801
Are you now trying to shame me
in front of my own wife?

07:11.880 --> 07:12.881
Well, if she's your wife,

07:12.960 --> 07:15.247
I imagine she's more familiar
with your balls than I am.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.690
Don't test me, brother.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.442
Ye always knew how to make an entrance.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.846
We thought you were dead

07:55.920 --> 07:58.366
until we received your chest
from Castle Leoch.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.089

came to my mind to do.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.521
But he didn't like it

13:27.680 --> 13:29.330
when I laughed and I could see that,

13:29.400 --> 13:31.209
so I laughed some more.

Ye see, you were wrong
and I'm expecting an apology.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.401
Well, have I not said as much?

14:32.480 --> 14:34.005
No, you haven't.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.322
She's right. She deserves an apology.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.800
This is between my brother and me.

14:43.680 --> 14:44.806
I was just suggesting that he...

14:44.920 --> 14:46.922
Can I see you in private for a moment?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.441
Excuse us.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.045
I'm your husband.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.124
You mustn't embarrass me
in front of my family and the servants.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.883
You're doing a fine enough job
of that yourself.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.442
And you've a sharp tongue, Claire.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.643
But there's a time and a place for it.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.131
And I suppose you'll be the judge of that?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.929
I need you to trust me here.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.531
I'm Laird. And you are my Lady.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.084
We should both conduct ourselves as such.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.322
I'm not the meek and obedient type.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.044
I don't think anyone would ever
make that mistake, Sassenach.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.168
But then, I don't think anyone would ever
say the same of Colum's wife, either.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.844
- Letitia?
- Aye.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.847
Strong woman. Respected.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.925
Feared even.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.845
But she never crossed
her husband's word in public.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.002
Now, behind closed doors...

16:04.840 --> 16:06.001
Well, let's just say

16:06.080 --> 16:08.606
my uncle dodged his share
of crockery in his time.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.681
Be careful, My Laird.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.931
I have a much better
throwing arm than the fair Letitia.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.086
So, whereabouts are ye from, Claire?

16:47.960 --> 16:49.644
Oxfordshire, originally.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.084
But I suppose this is now my home.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.243
Ye're planning on staying, then?

17:00.640 --> 17:01.721
Aye.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.165
Aye, we are.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.128
What about the price on yer head?

17:11.160 --> 17:15.085
I'm expecting a pardon
with the aid of the Duke of Sandringham.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.240
It hasn't come through yet,
but we're hoping it will soon.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.242
Never thought you'd be
so trusting of the English.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.451
Perhaps I could trouble you
for some warm water to wash?

17:34.760 --> 17:36.000
Been a difficult few days.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.570
- And you mentioned a chest from Leoch?
- IAN: Aye.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.969
It came from a woman
called Mrs. Fitzgibbons.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.963
It's upstairs in the spare room.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.281
Well, since the Laird's staying,
he should have the main bedchamber.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.691
Move our things to the north room.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.047
No, I wouldn't dream
of putting you out of your room.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.806
Well...

17:58.880 --> 18:01.121
Seeing as it's the Laird's room, after all,

18:02.280 --> 18:03.281
I'll get the keys.

The what?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.326
The servants.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.607
They tore through here like dervishes.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.409
I'd barely turned my back,

18:37.560 --> 18:40.245
and they'd cleared away
all of Jenny and Ian's things.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.171
It's almost exactly how I remember it.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.529
My father always had a book over there

18:57.560 --> 18:59.562
open at the page he was reading.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.641
Hmm.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.765
And he used to put his boots here.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.521
Hmm.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.606
And he used to keep his... Keep his...

19:15.600 --> 19:17.489
- (CLUNK)
- Ah...

19:20.440 --> 19:21.521
His blade.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.643
Oh, it's beautiful.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.441

I told you, I was raised by an archeologist.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.042
I recognize the patterns on the hilt.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.808
It's a fine example.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.484
I'd hardly tiptoe in here as a boy,

19:54.920 --> 19:57.241
so sacred was the Laird's room.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.642
But I'd slip in when he was out at the fields

20:01.920 --> 20:04.924
just to hold it for a few moments.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.807
Dream of the day it would be mine.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.802

20:30.120 --> 20:31.645
he built this place, ye ken.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.809
His blood and sweat are in this stone.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.451
This land.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.002
And now his bones are as well.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.882
They buried him out in the graveyard

20:52.560 --> 20:55.211
next to my mother and my brother, Willie.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.483
When was the last time you saw your father?

21:05.880 --> 21:10.090
<i>It was at Fort William,
a week after I'd been flogged the first time.</i>

21:14.880 --> 21:17.087
- Jamie.
- Father. What are you doing here?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.084
Having a word with Captain Randall.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.446
Trying to see if we can get ye out.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.522
I'm sorry for the whole damn mess.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.085
You left me in charge, and now Jenny's...

21:24.160 --> 21:26.003
What has happened is not yer fault.

21:27.480 --> 21:28.891
I know you were flogged.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.004
- I'll be all right.
- Captain Randall is waiting.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.161
No.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.401
This is my son.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.851
Have ye no compassion?

21:36.520 --> 21:37.521
Remember to pray.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.844
And I'll stand by ye, no matter what happens.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.691
Ye're a braw lad, son.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.481
(GRUNTS)

21:58.080 --> 22:00.128
I just met your father.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.250
He's worried about you.

22:06.560 --> 22:10.246
I'm afraid he was disappointed
when I told him

22:10.360 --> 22:12.283
your charges are of such a serious nature

22:12.360 --> 22:13.725
that you cannot be bonded without

22:13.800 --> 22:15.723
a written clearance from the Duke of Argyll.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.881
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:23.320 --> 22:24.651
The thing is...

22:26.040 --> 22:29.203
Even if he does succeed
in getting such a clearance,

22:29.280 --> 22:30.441
which I doubt,

22:32.880 --> 22:36.566
it would be impossible for him
to make it back in time.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.806
So...

22:50.760 --> 22:53.764
It's a shame that you and I
have got off to such a poor start.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.684
Only a week before,

23:02.680 --> 23:05.001
he'd had me flogged near to death.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.770
Didn't understand, I couldna imagine
what he was talking about now.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.444
And he bandied words around for a while.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.802
He likes to do that.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.011
Likes to play with his toys.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.808
But in the end, he was quite blunt
about what he really wanted.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.806
Which was what?

23:35.800 --> 23:36.961
Me.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.130
It's quite simple.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.211
Give over to me,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.123
make free of your body,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.566
and there will be no second flogging.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.650
And if not...

24:06.480 --> 24:07.845

Well...

24:25.920 --> 24:27.729

24:31.840 --> 24:35.367
The first stripes were still raw on my back.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.362
I could scarce bear my shirt

24:40.840 --> 24:44.845
and I felt dizzy every time I stood up.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.885
The thought of...

24:49.880 --> 24:52.201
Of going through it all again...

24:52.920 --> 24:55.571
Being bound, helpless,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.921
waiting for the next lash...

25:05.960 --> 25:08.201
I had no real idea, of course, but...

25:09.120 --> 25:12.124
I thought being buggered
would be less painful.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.326
And be over quicker, most likely.

25:16.400 --> 25:20.325
And he said I'd be set
free the same day, so...

25:23.080 --> 25:24.081
So...

25:25.560 --> 25:27.562
I considered it.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.967
But...

25:44.000 --> 25:47.527
I could still feel my
father's kiss on my cheek.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.761
And thought what he would think of me...

25:52.680 --> 25:56.526
<i>Not the buggery,
he'd not give that a thought or care, but...</i>

25:57.760 --> 25:59.285
<i>For giving in.</i>

26:00.840 --> 26:03.207
<i>For letting that man break me.</i>

26:07.040 --> 26:08.769

26:31.840 --> 26:33.524
<i>I fell halfway through.</i>

26:41.640 --> 26:43.324
<i>He thought I was dead.</i>

26:46.400 --> 26:49.609
<i>Dougal said he let out a small sound,</i>

26:49.680 --> 26:51.648
<i>- and dropped liked a rock.</i>

27:02.760 --> 27:04.762
Didn't see him die.

Didn't see him taken away.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.090
Didn't see him buried.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.726
Never even seen his grave.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.362
Even if you had given in to Randall,

27:24.440 --> 27:26.204
do you really think it would
have made any difference?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.124
And don't you think he would have

27:29.200 --> 27:31.646
still had you dragged out
into that yard and flogged you

27:31.720 --> 27:33.722
just for the sick pleasure it gave him?

No.

JAMIE: Aye.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.163
Then ye'll have a lot to learn
about keeping up a place like this.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.846
I would imagine.
It sounds quite challenging.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.604
But I'm a quick study.

Ye'll get your chance.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.364
- What is that?
- Ah, well...

28:42.840 --> 28:45.525
It's, like, when we collected the rents
for the MacKenzies.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.722
But here, the tenants come to us to pay.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.121
And sorely needed, this quarter.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.487
We've had poor harvests two years running.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.164
We're piling debt upon debt.

Isn't that risky?

29:05.720 --> 29:07.563
At least until your pardon comes through?

29:08.040 --> 29:10.361
- No.
- Our tenants are like family.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.204
Not a man, woman or child

29:12.280 --> 29:14.487

betraying Jamie to the Redcoats.

Of course. That's good to hear.

Aye.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.001
Mmm.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.802
Hair of the dog?

37:33.360 --> 37:35.362
I think I may need the whole hound.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.481
(DOOR OPENS)

37:39.480 --> 37:42.529
Ian tells me ye didna collect
the rents yesterday.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.846
It's been a hard year, as ye said yerself.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.566
As Laird, I decided
to give my tenants some ease.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.484
And how easy do ye suppose
yer tenants will be

37:55.560 --> 37:58.325
when the whole estate goes under
because we canna make ends meet?

37:58.400 --> 38:00.368
Perhaps we should postpone this
until he's feeling a little...

38:00.480 --> 38:02.369
And ye've saddled us
with another mouth to feed.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.686
What're ye on about, Jenny?

38:03.840 --> 38:06.684
Rabbie MacNab's father threw him out
thanks to you.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.127
He said if Jamie Fraser thinks
he can be a better father,

38:09.200 --> 38:10.884
he can damn well pay for his upkeep.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.843
Jenny, he was only trying
to help the boy out.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.160
Clean clothes and bannocks

38:14.240 --> 38:16.607
aren't going to stop the boy
from being beaten.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.771
Do you think life just started

38:18.840 --> 38:20.683
when the two of you
walked through that door?

38:21.760 --> 38:25.685
Rabbie's granny and I were working on
Ronald's sister to take the boy.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.811
Did ye not even consider talkin' to me
before ye pulled our yer fists?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.168
Do ye think that's how Father
would've handled things?

38:34.440 --> 38:36.124
I am the Laird of this estate now.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.283
And I do not need to discuss
the running of it with my sister.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.361
(SCOFFS)

38:42.920 --> 38:46.720
Begging yer pardon, Laird Broch Tuarach.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.325
Mrs. Crook.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.481
Yes, My Laird?

39:12.560 --> 39:16.246
This bread tastes like
it was made with pebbles.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.167
The mill's not working properly.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.323
We had to grind the flour by hand.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.640
What's being done about it?

39:22.920 --> 39:25.400
The Mistress, or Mrs. Murray,

39:26.080 --> 39:28.208
had me send for Davy McAndrews

39:28.320 --> 39:29.560
to fix the mill.

39:30.760 --> 39:31.921
I'll deal with it myself.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.081
(DOOR CLOSES)

39:54.240 --> 39:55.765
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

39:57.040 --> 39:58.041
How's it looking?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.680
It'd be a damn sight better
if the wheel were turning.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.689
There must be something
stuck under the sluice.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.485
I'm gonna have to go down,

40:08.560 --> 40:10.608
- see if I can pry it loose.
- What?

40:13.200 --> 40:15.646
But, Jamie...

40:16.960 --> 40:18.450
You'll freeze to death.

40:19.960 --> 40:20.961
Most likely.

40:22.360 --> 40:25.125
At least ye'll be able to serve
decent bannocks at my wake.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.928
Oh! Cack!

40:30.000 --> 40:32.810
Mrs. Crook told me the stupid fool
had come up here.

40:32.880 --> 40:36.202
Jenny, you shouldn't be chasing around
in your condition.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.282
There was no need for you to come after us.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.561
Aye, there was.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.244
Keep silent. We don't want them
to know you're English.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.761
- Good morrow, ladies.
- Good morrow.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.411
If ye're stopping for a bag of meal,
I'm afraid ye'll be disappointed.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.369
The mill wheel's not working just now.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.842
Perhaps next time ye come this way?

41:17.360 --> 41:18.441
Well...

41:19.880 --> 41:21.086
What's amiss, then?

41:24.720 --> 41:25.721
Ye should call yer master back.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.569
He shouldna meddle in things
he doesna understand.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.969
You've no cause for worry, missus.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.724
The Corporal's father has
a wheat mill in Hampshire.

41:33.800 --> 41:37.122
What he doesn't know about waterwheels
would fit in a shoe.

41:43.640 --> 41:44.721
(MUFFLED) No help for it.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.848
I'll have to go under
and see what's holding it.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.731
Look at that.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.085
I wonder what was stuck in it.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.400
Hey.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.123
A perfectly good shirt.

42:12.240 --> 42:17.485
How on the earth
did that get stuck into the mill?

42:20.160 --> 42:22.162
It's Scotland, sir.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.808
- Ladies.
- Thank ye kindly, sir.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.281
Hiyah!

42:39.760 --> 42:40.966
Jamie!

42:42.400 --> 42:44.050
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

42:44.840 --> 42:46.444
Blessed Michael, defend us!

42:47.440 --> 42:49.681
What the hell were you doing?

42:49.760 --> 42:51.046
Have you not grown up a bit?

42:52.440 --> 42:56.126
Jenny, will ye please turn around
while I try to get out?

42:56.200 --> 42:57.964
Before my cock snaps off.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.645
What the hell was she doing here?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.602
Heard about the Redcoat patrol.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.682
She was just trying to warn you.

43:44.400 --> 43:45.925
IAN: So you're a night owl, are ye?

43:48.360 --> 43:50.442
Yes, I suppose I am.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.565
Jenny's up with the lark,

43:53.040 --> 43:55.407
but I've always been an owl myself.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.890
Is this Jenny?

43:58.080 --> 44:00.606
Aye. Those were her birds.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.488
Any time one was found
with a lame leg or a broken wing,

44:04.560 --> 44:06.449
she'd have it healed
and eating from her hand.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.402
Surprised she has a gentle side?

44:11.600 --> 44:13.125
No, of course not.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.249
Perhaps a little.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.441
She's a Fraser.

44:19.880 --> 44:24.044
Their hearts are as big and soft
as their heads are thick and strong.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.362
It was Jenny who took care of me

44:27.440 --> 44:30.364
after I returned from France
with a stump of wood.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.005
Jamie told me you lost it

44:33.080 --> 44:34.809
while the both of you
were fighting in France.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.242
It doesn't slow me down much.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.489
It aches a wee bit towards the end of the day.

44:41.560 --> 44:44.723
Have you tried guelder rose or water pepper?

44:46.280 --> 44:47.805
I've not tried the water pepper, no.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.169
Well, I'd be happy to make some for you.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.285
Thank you.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.927
Jamie said you were a healer.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.162
You've seen mangled men before?

45:00.600 --> 45:03.285
Yes, many, unfortunately.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.161
Jamie hadn't.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.481
It shocked him to see me like this at first.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.120
He tried to hide it, but I knew.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.367
No matter.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.130
He brought me back to Scotland.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.242
And Jenny made me whole again.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.010
- Is that why you married her?
- (CHUCKLES)

45:20.960 --> 45:22.962
Ye think I had any choice in the matter?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.969
She came up to me out in the field one day,

45:28.120 --> 45:30.122
while I was mending a fence.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.691
I was covered with muck,

45:33.160 --> 45:36.164
and her, standing there
like a bush covered with butterflies.

45:36.960 --> 45:41.602
She says, well, I dinna ken
exactly what she said, but...

45:42.480 --> 45:45.324
It ended with her kissing me, and saying,

45:45.440 --> 45:48.205
"Fine, we'll be married on St. Martin's Day."

45:49.280 --> 45:52.648
And I was still explaining to her
why we couldna do any such thing

45:52.800 --> 45:55.451
when I found myself
in front of a priest saying,

45:55.520 --> 45:57.488
"I take thee, Janet."

45:57.560 --> 45:58.891
(CHUCKLES)

45:58.960 --> 46:01.122
She's an extraordinary woman, isn't she?

46:01.480 --> 46:05.724
Aye. When she's not being an outright
stubborn-headed, pain-in-the-arse mule.

46:07.880 --> 46:08.961
Frasers.

46:09.480 --> 46:11.482
Once they've dug their heels in,
there's no budging them,

46:12.880 --> 46:16.487
and ye don't want to get between them
when their danders are up.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.562
- How do you manage?
- Well,

46:19.400 --> 46:20.765
ye can tug on their rope

46:20.880 --> 46:23.281
or give them a wee kick in their backside.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.771
And they might move,

46:25.240 --> 46:26.765
or ye might get bit for yer trouble.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.361
And then what?

46:31.400 --> 46:32.731
Kick them harder.

46:49.400 --> 46:50.401
(GROANS)

46:51.440 --> 46:53.761
Good. Now I have your attention.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.365
And you're going to listen to me.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.041
I did not marry the Laird of Lallybroch.

46:58.120 --> 46:59.849
I married Jamie,
but I haven't seen much of him

46:59.960 --> 47:01.371
since we walked through
the gates of this place.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.249
- That's who I am, now that...
- I am speaking,

47:03.360 --> 47:04.805
and you can talk when I'm finished.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.284
Your father's dead, Jamie.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.040
But if he were here,

47:11.120 --> 47:13.487
I wager he'd give you a thrashing
for the way you've been acting.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.281
You're trying to be someone you're not.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.765
And in the process,

47:17.840 --> 47:20.241
you're wrecking the family
that you do have left.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.086
And if you're not careful,
you're going to lose them, too.

48:01.160 --> 48:02.161
(EXHALES)

48:03.800 --> 48:04.961
Jenny.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.330
You gave me a start.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.441
Thought it was a ghost for a minute, did ye?

48:14.600 --> 48:15.840
- Jamie, I...
- Jenny, I...

48:22.280 --> 48:24.328
Let me speak first, please.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.728
That's the rent from the tenants.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.369
And I thought perhaps

48:39.440 --> 48:41.283
I could speak to Rabbie's aunt, so...

48:42.680 --> 48:43.886
Even if she had taken him in,

48:43.960 --> 48:45.962
I don't think it would have lasted.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.042
She's a frachety woman
with too many bairns as it is.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.362
This is a better place for him.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.363
Father would have thought so, too.

48:59.640 --> 49:00.721
Aye.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.043
I was wrong not to consult ye,
and I'm sorry for it.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.161
Truly.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.891
I hope to do it different in future.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.321
I'm the one who's wronged you
and I'm so ashamed.

49:20.080 --> 49:21.411
Of What?

49:23.760 --> 49:25.603
Ever since Father died,

49:28.160 --> 49:31.687
a small, dark part of me
has blamed you for his death.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.920
When they told me what
happened at Fort William,

49:36.720 --> 49:38.449
that Randall flogged ye himself

49:38.520 --> 49:40.602
and that seeing that is what killed Father,

49:40.680 --> 49:44.526
I thought ye must have done
something to bring it upon yerself.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.726
Shot yer mouth off

49:45.840 --> 49:47.922
or acted without thinking
of the consequences,

49:48.040 --> 49:49.371
as ye have done all yer life.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.361
But then out at the mill pond,

49:54.920 --> 49:57.241
when I saw the scars on yer back,

49:58.520 --> 50:03.765
scars made by a lash
laid down with such fury...

50:03.880 --> 50:05.211
Dinna fash yerself about it anymore.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.131
It was me. It's my fault
that Randall beat you so.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.725
- You dinna ken what you're saying.
- But I do.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.963
That day...
That day when Randall came here,

50:16.600 --> 50:18.648
when he took me upstairs,

50:19.040 --> 50:21.247
if I hadn't mocked him that way,

50:21.320 --> 50:22.606
if I'd given him what he wanted,

50:22.720 --> 50:24.722
he wouldn't have treated you like he did.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.167
- And then Father...
- Cry not.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.161
Don't.

50:29.640 --> 50:30.641
(SOBBING)

50:34.160 --> 50:37.323
I did anger Randall at Fort William,

50:39.440 --> 50:41.761
and I've spent the past four years
of my life blaming myself

50:41.840 --> 50:43.842
for Father's death because of it.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.922
- But now ye know better?
- Aye.

50:48.440 --> 50:49.441
(CHUCKLES)

50:49.520 --> 50:50.851
Aye. I do.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.444
I know it's not yer fault.

50:58.440 --> 51:00.010
Nor mine either.

51:00.920 --> 51:04.367
There's a devil in that man
that no one can influence.

51:06.320 --> 51:09.369
The only one responsible
for putting Father in his grave

51:11.040 --> 51:12.610
is Jack Randall.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.047
Aye?

51:19.880 --> 51:21.291
It does trouble me, though,

51:23.040 --> 51:25.441
knowing ye went with him to save me,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.843
knowing he might harm ye.

51:29.640 --> 51:32.291
I would have gladly died to spare you.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.320
And if yer life is a suitable exchange
for my honor,

51:36.400 --> 51:39.483
tell me why my honor
is not a suitable exchange for yer life.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.767
Or are ye telling me that I may not
love ye as much as you love me?

51:42.840 --> 51:45.650
Because if ye are, Jamie Fraser,
I'll tell you right now it's not true.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.087
No.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.764
Welcome home,

51:58.480 --> 52:00.482
Laird Broch Tuarach.

52:08.840 --> 52:09.887
Come.

52:27.200 --> 52:30.841
You said "Broch Tuarach" means
"north-facing tower."

52:32.120 --> 52:33.201
Aye.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.362
Well, it's round, it doesn't have a face.

52:36.680 --> 52:37.886
Well...

52:39.400 --> 52:40.765
The door faces north.

52:41.360 --> 52:42.361
(CHUCKLES)

52:46.160 --> 52:47.491
Frasers.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.202
I'm beginning to feel like...

52:57.240 --> 52:58.241
Like I...

52:59.360 --> 53:01.408
Like I actually belong here.

53:05.040 --> 53:09.921
I knew ye belonged here, with me,

53:11.000 --> 53:14.004
almost since the first time I laid eyes on ye.

53:15.080 --> 53:17.162
That's one of the reasons
I agreed to marry you.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.561
Though not the main one.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.601
- Then what was the main one?
- (CHUCKLES)

53:24.320 --> 53:28.325
Because I wanted you more
than I ever wanted anything in my life.

53:30.480 --> 53:33.689
Right from that moment I fell off the horse

53:33.760 --> 53:36.764
and woke up in the dark
looking up at your face.

53:37.920 --> 53:40.764
Then there was that
long ride together with that

53:41.480 --> 53:45.451
lovely round arse wedged
tight between my thighs,

53:45.520 --> 53:48.205
and that rock-solid head
thumping me in the chest.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.760
That's why you agreed to marry me,

53:51.960 --> 53:54.804
because of my round arse
and my rock-solid head?

53:54.880 --> 53:55.927
Mm.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.729
I wanted ye from the first moment I saw ye.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.211
But...

54:01.280 --> 54:02.611
I loved ye

54:03.440 --> 54:06.444
when ye wept in my arms
that first night at Leoch.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.011
But now I...

54:09.840 --> 54:12.684
I wake up every day, and I find that

54:13.320 --> 54:15.846
I love you more than I did the day before.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.642
I love you.

55:18.520 --> 55:19.851
MAN: Keep calm now, lad.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.405
With what right did you
come to this house without...

55:21.480 --> 55:24.848
- (TRIGGER COCKS)
- I’ve heard enough from the likes of you.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.921
Now you stay silent as a lamb, my friend...

55:31.880 --> 55:35.885
Or this lovely lass is gonna be scrubbing
yer brains off the floor.
