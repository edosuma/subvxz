My heart beat!

00:28.194 --> 00:30.113
(Heart beating)

00:30.196 --> 00:32.782
What's Gil listening to?

00:34.451 --> 00:37.162
Yeah, he's listening
to his heart.

00:37.245 --> 00:37.579
It's time for--

00:37.662 --> 00:42.000
My tummy!

00:42.083 --> 00:44.294
Hmm...

00:44.377 --> 00:46.796
{\an3}Your tummy!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.006
(Stomach growling)

00:48.089 --> 00:49.591
Your stomach is
talking to me!

00:49.674 --> 00:51.634
It is? What's it saying?

00:51.718 --> 00:55.513
It's saying...

00:55.597 --> 00:57.807

Hi!

Hello!

01:48.566 --> 01:51.528
It's the mayor!

01:51.611 --> 01:53.279
Hi, Mayor!

01:53.363 --> 01:54.697
Hi, girls!

01:54.781 --> 01:57.575
Run with me!

01:58.284 --> 02:00.662
Where are you running, Mayor?

02:00.745 --> 02:03.248
I'm practicing for the
big marathon!

02:03.331 --> 02:05.083
What's a marathon?

02:05.166 --> 02:07.043
A marathon is a big race!

02:07.126 --> 02:10.505
I've been looking forward
to it all year.

02:10.588 --> 02:11.714
I just love to run!

02:11.798 --> 02:15.009
It's such great exercise!

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
Yeah, and it's fun too!

02:16.886 --> 02:18.054
(Stomach gurgling)

02:18.137 --> 02:20.348
Oh.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.308
What's wrong, Mayor?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.810
(Gurgling)

02:23.893 --> 02:27.397
Heh, it's my stomach.
I have a little tummy ache.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.065
Mayor's got a tummy ache!

02:29.149 --> 02:32.402
Mayor's got a tummy ache!
Send in assistance, immediately.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.945
We're going to get you
to the doctor.

02:34.028 --> 02:37.073
Especially if you want to run in
that marathon today.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.867
You guys, it's nothing...

02:38.950 --> 02:41.744
Send in a clam-bulance.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.372
(Siren wailing)

02:50.753 --> 02:52.755
This is silly, boys.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.717
You don't go to the hospital for
a teeny little tummy ache.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.176
I'm fine!

02:57.260 --> 02:58.761
You're very brave, Mayor.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.263
Mayor's being brave.

03:03.057 --> 03:06.060
Well, girls, I'm sure
everything's fine,

03:06.144 --> 03:09.230
but I guess I'd better go see
my doctor to make sure.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.399
I hope I see you
at the marathon!

03:11.482 --> 03:13.902
I hope your tummy feels better!

03:13.985 --> 03:14.986
Bye, Mayor!

03:15.069 --> 03:17.614
Goodbye, girls!

03:22.994 --> 03:25.204
I'm sure she's going to be fine.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.957
Me too.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.295
Come on!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.387
Hi there!

03:41.471 --> 03:42.555
Hey!

03:42.639 --> 03:44.390
Hello!

03:47.226 --> 03:49.395
ALL:
Good morning, Mr. Grouper!

03:49.479 --> 03:50.897
Well, good morning,
everyone!

03:50.980 --> 03:54.442
Mr. Grouper, Mr. Grouper!
We saw the Mayor!

03:54.525 --> 03:56.486
She was practicing
for a big race!

03:56.569 --> 04:01.074
But then she got a tummy ache,
so she went to the hospital!

04:01.157 --> 04:01.950
{\an3}Oh, no!

04:02.033 --> 04:04.202
Will she be okay, Mr. Grouper?

04:04.285 --> 04:06.996
Oh, I'm sure the doctors
at the hospital

04:07.080 --> 04:09.582
will make sure
her stomach's just fine.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.709
I call my stomach my tummy!

04:11.793 --> 04:13.878
Your stomach is a part
inside your body.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.214
That's right, Nonny!

04:16.297 --> 04:18.841
We have lots of parts
inside our bodies.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.345
Like my heart!
It's in here and it goes:

04:22.428 --> 04:24.013
ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.392
And I breathe with my lungs!

04:27.475 --> 04:30.853
Use your lungs to take
a deep breath with me. Come on!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.523
Inhale.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.358
Exhale.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.859
(Giggling)

04:36.943 --> 04:41.489
Let's think about the parts
we have inside our body!

04:41.572 --> 04:45.785
The part of the body where
food goes is called your...

04:45.868 --> 04:49.038
(Stomach gurgling)

04:49.122 --> 04:50.373
{\an3}Stomach!

04:50.456 --> 04:51.916
That's right!

04:52.000 --> 04:56.963
And the organs that help us
breathe are called the...

04:57.046 --> 05:00.049
(Inhaling)

05:00.133 --> 05:01.050
{\an3}Lungs!

05:01.134 --> 05:03.052
That's right!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.096
And the part of your body
that beats--

05:05.179 --> 05:07.223
ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum--

05:07.306 --> 05:09.600
is called your...

05:09.684 --> 05:12.603
(Beating)

05:12.687 --> 05:13.896
{\an3}Heart!

05:13.980 --> 05:17.066
Yup! The heart in your body
is shaped like this!

05:17.150 --> 05:21.946
And all the important parts like
these are called your organs!

05:22.030 --> 05:25.366
Organs are cool!

If you like your organs

07:17.728 --> 07:18.688
Hi there!

07:18.771 --> 07:20.982
Do you like your tummy
and heart and stuff?

07:21.065 --> 07:22.358
{\an1}Uh-huh!

07:22.441 --> 07:26.070
Then you've certainly come to
the right place!

07:26.154 --> 07:28.656
It's time to play...

07:28.739 --> 07:32.201
ALL:
Let's... get... organ-ized!

07:34.829 --> 07:36.956
As you can see,
this person needs our help

07:37.039 --> 07:40.001
to organize his organs!

07:40.084 --> 07:43.796
Now, if you can put all three
organs in the right places,

07:43.880 --> 07:47.675
you'll win this beautiful
silver stethoscope!

07:50.219 --> 07:53.890
A stethoscope is what doctors
use to listen to your organs.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.892
(Applause)

07:55.975 --> 07:57.643
Okay, let's take a look
at these organs!

07:57.727 --> 08:01.939
Those are the heart, the lungs,
and the stomach!

08:02.023 --> 08:04.150
That's right!

08:04.233 --> 08:06.319
So let's start with the heart!

08:06.402 --> 08:09.030
Now take a look at the shape
of the heart.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.239
Where does it go?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.408
I need your help.

08:12.491 --> 08:16.787
Does this shape go
here, here, or here?

08:20.708 --> 08:21.959
Right there!

08:22.043 --> 08:24.253
That's correct!

08:24.337 --> 08:25.963
The heart pushes blood
through your body.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.341
On to our next organs!

08:28.424 --> 08:30.760
These organs sound like this:

08:30.843 --> 08:31.677
(Breathing)

08:34.179 --> 08:37.600
Those are the lungs!

08:37.683 --> 08:38.893
Right again!

08:38.976 --> 08:40.770
Your lungs help you breathe!

08:40.852 --> 08:42.980
Now... for the
silver stethoscope...

08:43.063 --> 08:46.025
where do the lungs go?

08:46.108 --> 08:47.318
Hmm...

08:47.401 --> 08:49.904
I need your help again!

08:49.987 --> 08:51.989
Do the lungs go here?

08:52.073 --> 08:56.118
Or here?

08:56.202 --> 08:58.538
There!

08:56.202 --> 08:58.538
Right there!

08:58.621 --> 09:00.331
Correct!

09:00.414 --> 09:03.626
That means the stomach
goes there!

09:03.709 --> 09:05.169
That's right!

09:05.253 --> 09:08.172
And now all the organs
are in the right place!

09:08.256 --> 09:10.424
Oona, you've organized
those organs

09:10.508 --> 09:14.553
and you win the
silver stethoscope!

09:14.637 --> 09:15.471
{\an3}Thank you!

09:15.554 --> 09:18.891
And thank you
for all your help!

09:18.975 --> 09:20.184
Excuse me...

09:20.268 --> 09:22.144
What time is it?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.939
My tummy's telling me...

09:25.022 --> 09:26.983
It's time for lunch!

09:41.247 --> 09:42.498
What did you get, Oona?

09:42.581 --> 09:46.210
I have a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.337
What did you get, Nonny?

09:48.421 --> 09:52.049
I got a peanut butter and...

09:52.133 --> 09:53.843
belly sandwich?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.970
(Laughing)

09:56.053 --> 09:58.055
Peanut butter and belly?

09:58.139 --> 10:01.559
That's ridiculous!

10:01.642 --> 10:03.853
We all have lots of organs
in our bodies,

10:03.936 --> 10:07.231
and each organ has a special job
to do-- like the heart!

10:07.315 --> 10:09.233
It pumps blood
that our bodies need.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.609
Hey, Molly.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.072
What are you doing, Gil?

10:15.156 --> 10:16.449
I'm gonna start jogging

10:16.532 --> 10:18.868
so I can keep my heart
healthy and strong.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.037
See that?
That's my heart beat.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.204
{\an1}Neat.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
And the faster I run,
the faster my heart will beat.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.710
{\an3}Watch!

10:27.793 --> 10:28.711
{\an3}See?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.213
Careful, Gilly.
Don't overdo it.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.424
Don't worry... Molly...

10:33.507 --> 10:35.801
I can... run... even...

10:35.885 --> 10:36.218
Uh-oh!

10:36.302 --> 10:40.639
{\an3}(Yelling)

10:40.723 --> 10:41.057
(Barking)

10:41.140 --> 10:43.017
{\an3}I'm okay!

10:43.100 --> 10:44.977
(Laughing)

10:45.061 --> 10:46.479
Hey, Molly!

10:46.562 --> 10:48.731
We're learning about our organs!

10:48.814 --> 10:51.317
Come on!

10:55.488 --> 10:58.908
Ladies and gentlemen...

10:58.991 --> 11:01.452
your organs!

11:02.787 --> 11:05.623
I'm your heart!
I get your blood moving!

11:05.706 --> 11:08.959
You can feel me if you put your
hand on your chest.

11:09.043 --> 11:09.919
Bump-bump! Bump-bump!

11:10.002 --> 11:12.088
{\an1}(Giggling)

11:12.171 --> 11:13.589
BOTH:
Bump-bump! Bump-bump! Bump-bump!

11:13.673 --> 11:16.092
And next...

11:16.175 --> 11:17.593
BOTH:
We're your lungs!

11:17.676 --> 11:20.137
When you take a deep breath,
we get bigger.

11:20.221 --> 11:25.434
(Breathing)

11:28.854 --> 11:32.108
And next we have...

11:32.191 --> 11:35.277
Hey, stomach! You're up!

11:35.361 --> 11:37.238
I'm the stomach.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.241
I turn the food you eat
into energy.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.284
It's no fun when
you get a stomach ache.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.247
You seem upset, stomach.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.374
What's wrong, Oona?

11:48.457 --> 11:51.710
I hope the mayor's
feeling better.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.463
Oh, I'm sure she's doing fine.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.425
Doctors are really good at
taking care of people.

11:57.508 --> 12:01.095
But she really wanted to run
in the race.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.807
Well, maybe she'll feel better
soon, and then she can run.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.809
I hope so!

12:06.892 --> 12:08.060
Okay, everybody!

12:08.144 --> 12:09.478
Line up!

12:38.007 --> 12:39.758
Once upon a time...

12:39.842 --> 12:43.512
there was a little boy with a
really bad tummy ache.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.557
My stomach hurts.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.894
Well, Nonny,
I've run some tests---

12:49.977 --> 12:53.022
and it looks like you have
a nasty stomach bug.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.357
(Roaring)

12:55.441 --> 12:58.611
A bug is just another word

12:58.694 --> 13:01.071
for a bad germ
that makes you sick.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.657
Don't worry.

13:03.741 --> 13:08.662
I'm sending two of my best
nurses to take care of it.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.081
I'm gonna shrink them down and
send them into your stomach.

13:11.165 --> 13:16.295
They'll get rid of that nasty
bug and make you feel better.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.149
Say, "ahh..."

13:37.233 --> 13:39.818
Ahh...

13:39.902 --> 13:41.445
Aaahh!

13:48.244 --> 13:53.290
{\an5}MR. GROUPER:
<i>Nurses, you are now</i>
<i>inside Nonny's mouth,</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:57.711
and are smaller than a
teeny weeny grain of sand.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.881
BOTH:
Cool!

14:00.965 --> 14:04.635
<i>You are approaching</i>
<i>the stomach, nurses.</i>

14:04.718 --> 14:06.428
{\an3}(Screaming)

14:09.557 --> 14:12.393
What was that all about?

14:12.476 --> 14:13.978
Those are good bugs that live in
your stomach.

14:14.061 --> 14:18.274
They help your stomach
use the food you eat.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.734
(Groaning)

14:20.818 --> 14:23.988
We're heading for
the stomach now, Doctor.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.656
(Roaring)

14:25.739 --> 14:26.782
{\an3}Ahh!

14:26.865 --> 14:29.660
That stomach bug is scaring away
all the good bugs!

14:29.743 --> 14:32.121
No wonder Nonny
has a tummy ache!

14:32.204 --> 14:33.038
We've got to stop it!

14:33.122 --> 14:35.791
Hmm?

14:35.874 --> 14:37.167
(Roaring)

14:37.251 --> 14:38.419
Uh-oh...

14:38.502 --> 14:42.590
Let's get out of here!

14:47.177 --> 14:49.805
Phew, I think we lost him.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.473
But where are we?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.310
You're inside Nonny's lungs.

14:54.393 --> 14:58.522
<i>You use your lungs</i>
<i>to breathe air.</i>

14:58.606 --> 14:59.481
(Roaring)

14:59.565 --> 15:01.984
The stomach bug!

15:16.749 --> 15:18.208
(Thumping)

15:18.292 --> 15:19.043
Now where are we?

15:19.126 --> 15:22.838
I think we're inside
Nonny's heart!

15:22.921 --> 15:23.881
Yup!

15:23.964 --> 15:27.593
Our hearts pump blood
all around our bodies.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.344
<i>Loud.</i>

15:28.427 --> 15:32.222
{\an3}(Roaring)

15:32.306 --> 15:34.850
BOTH:
Stomach bug!

15:45.819 --> 15:47.196
What do we do?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.822
If only we had
a shrink ray!

15:48.906 --> 15:52.493
You mean like
this shrink ray?

15:54.286 --> 15:55.996
We have a shrink ray?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.582
{\an3}Eep!

16:04.213 --> 16:05.130
Hey, stomach bug.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.717
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

16:08.801 --> 16:12.137
You're making Nonny sick!

16:12.221 --> 16:15.224
(Sobbing)

16:15.307 --> 16:16.225
I'm sorry!

16:16.308 --> 16:20.229
I didn't mean to make
the little boy sick!

16:20.312 --> 16:23.399
I just wanted to help
his stomach work!

16:23.482 --> 16:27.569
I don't want to be
a bad bug anymore...

16:27.653 --> 16:29.238
Well, if you promise
to be good from now on,

16:29.321 --> 16:33.992
you can help the other good bugs
turn Nonny's food into energy.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.078
Sounds kinda gross.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.705
But they seem to enjoy it.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.582
ALL:
Mm-hmm!

16:40.666 --> 16:42.751
I'll be good.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.629
(Cheering)

16:45.713 --> 16:48.090
And so... the stomach bug
agreed to be good

16:48.173 --> 16:51.093
and went back to the stomach
to help digest Nonny's food.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.053
I feel better.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.431
Incoming!

16:55.514 --> 16:59.518
(Cheering)

16:59.601 --> 17:03.939
And they all lived
happily ever after.

17:04.021 --> 17:06.608
(Cheering)

17:06.692 --> 17:07.568

18:45.415 --> 18:48.001
{\an1}Hi, Gil.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.001
{\an3}Hey, Molly.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.379
Did you know that we use our
lungs to blow up balloons?

18:50.462 --> 18:51.755
Check it out!

18:51.839 --> 18:52.965
When we breath in air,
it goes to our lungs,

18:53.048 --> 18:56.635
and then we blow it out
into the balloon.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.705
ALL:
Field trip!

19:24.788 --> 19:27.916
Do you want to go with us to the
hospital to see the mayor?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.920
Great! Come on!

19:36.508 --> 19:38.468
Open wide, Mayor.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.095
Mayor's opening wide.

19:40.178 --> 19:42.264
Mmm! Yummy!

19:44.224 --> 19:46.476
Hi, Mayor.
How are you feeling?

19:46.560 --> 19:50.188
Oh, I'm feeling much better,
Doctor, thank you.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.024
But...

19:52.107 --> 19:53.859
What's the matter, Mayor?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.819
Oh, I'm fine.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.279
I'm just disappointed

19:57.362 --> 19:59.406
I didn't get to run in
the marathon today.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.116
Mayor's disappointed.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.451
Mayor wants to run.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.621
You can run a marathon
right here!

20:05.704 --> 20:06.914
Really?

20:06.997 --> 20:09.499
It'll be a mayor-thon!

20:09.583 --> 20:11.460
Mayor-thon?

20:11.543 --> 20:12.836
We have just to run three tests

20:12.920 --> 20:14.212
to make sure your organs
are healthy.

20:14.296 --> 20:18.675
We'll test your stomach,
your heart, and your lungs.

20:18.759 --> 20:22.804
When you get the green light
for each test, you pass!

20:22.888 --> 20:24.640
Oh, that sounds great!

20:24.723 --> 20:25.849
I can't wait!

20:25.933 --> 20:27.684
Mayor can't wait.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.312
You'll need this.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.023
Okay, Mayor! Let's go!

20:33.106 --> 20:34.691
Mayor's on the move.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.325
First test: the stomach!

20:50.165 --> 20:51.333
(Cheering)

20:51.416 --> 20:54.461
Second test: the heart!

21:01.426 --> 21:02.970
(Cheering)

21:03.053 --> 21:06.390
Final test: the lungs!

21:11.061 --> 21:13.689
Mayor's all better.
Cleared to run.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.733
(Cheering)

21:17.693 --> 21:20.946
Whoa!

21:38.005 --> 21:40.382

21:40.465 --> 21:43.677
Excuse me.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.472

21:48.807 --> 21:52.894
I'm glad that the mayor feels
better and that she got to run.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.730
Yeah, me too.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.064
(Stomach gurgling)

21:56.148 --> 21:57.899
Was that your stomach?

21:57.983 --> 22:02.821
Yeah, all that running
made me hungry.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.281
(Stomach groaning)

22:04.364 --> 22:07.659
I think somebody else
is hungry too.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.745
Uh-oh.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.164
