We'll embrace her as if
nothing happened ever, ever.

42:03.033 --> 42:04.567
- And I appreciate that.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.433
- He's still in love
with Jessica.

42:06.433 --> 42:08.033
You can tell!

42:08.033 --> 42:09.433
If he doesn't make
one more attempt,

42:09.467 --> 42:11.667
he'll regret it
for the rest of his life.

42:13.433 --> 42:16.700
I am 100% on board with him

42:16.700 --> 42:18.433
putting all his chips
on the table

42:18.467 --> 42:20.633
and trying one more time
with Jessica.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.734
But you can't have
one foot in, one foot out.

42:23.734 --> 42:26.734
[dramatic music]

42:26.734 --> 42:30.000
- Next on "Shahs of Sunset"...

42:30.033 --> 42:32.467
- [laughing]

42:32.467 --> 42:33.700
We're in Queens!

42:33.734 --> 42:35.734
I'm gonna start talkin'
like this.

42:35.734 --> 42:37.467
- You guys are my family.

42:37.467 --> 42:39.467
crowd: MJ! MJ!

42:39.467 --> 42:43.400
- I'm gonna let him know
right away

42:43.433 --> 42:44.667
I'm gonna...

42:46.200 --> 42:48.600
- Wonder where Mike was
last night.

42:48.633 --> 42:50.200
- I went to the Holiday Inn.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.700
- Trying to rekindle something
with your ex-wife?

42:53.734 --> 42:55.033
- Mike and Jessica

42:55.066 --> 42:57.200
need to get in
one last f---.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.667
- That's a f---ing yes!

42:59.700 --> 43:02.633
