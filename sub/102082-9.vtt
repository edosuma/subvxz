And you have. What now?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.760
Now I need my phone.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.440
My phone will prove
I didn't kill Max!

00:10.440 --> 00:12.200
Is James in trouble?

00:12.200 --> 00:15.680
I'm not sure he wasn't involved
in that boy's death.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.280
Oh, you're moving to Brisbane!
Were you gonna tell me?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.400

00:24.600 --> 00:27.240
Dr Fairley, I need you
to take on more duties.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.640
Supervisory duties.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.120
You'll be supervising Dr Harrow.

You don't give a shit about Fern.
You're just using her.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.760
I didn't steal a cent.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.880
FERN: If she thought you did,
what would she do to you?

00:37.880 --> 00:39.840
I think she'd kill me.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.120
Sometimes, when bodies are released

you tried to find us.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.920
You would have talked me back.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.480
Thanks for this, Pat.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.320
I don't understand
why he's not answering.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.080
Oh, he's probably still at work.
He works very hard, your brother.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.440

Well, I can't find Harrow.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.200
Well, there's a crime scene
I'd like him to take a look at.

And you too, so can you drop by
'The Bettie', see if he's there

Yeah. Not yet ambient.

around 4:00am.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.920
After a violent struggle, it seems.
Mm.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.400
Was it a break-in?
No signs of forced entry.

it was unusually quiet.

used to row quite a bit, apparently.

Last employed at a salon
in Spring Hill

08:03.360 --> 08:05.120
but hasn't worked in nearly a year.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.840
She's been living with Aaron Sharpe
for almost two years,

08:08.840 --> 08:11.960
just bought a house
and about to be engaged.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.760
What, the happy couple?

08:13.760 --> 08:15.360
Have you got her scans?

08:19.560 --> 08:22.680
Her thyroid cartilage is fractured.
The larynx too.

08:22.680 --> 08:27.120
And the hyoid bone, suggesting
death by manual compression.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.240
Mm-hm. Strangulation.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.640
Given the severity of
these contusions around her neck,

08:32.640 --> 08:34.880
as well as these scratch marks,

08:34.880 --> 08:37.800
it's highly likely
her attacker used bare hands.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.160
We should swab the wounds. With
any luck, we'll find contact DNA.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.760
And we should look under her
fingernails for skin, flesh, fibres.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.280
Any sign of a struggle.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.520
Well, there's some dirt here

08:52.520 --> 08:54.320
but no skin or flesh.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.840
Same with the left hand.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.600
How can that be?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.560
Perhaps she didn't fight back.
Who wouldn't fight back?

09:00.560 --> 09:03.240
Well, she may have been sedated.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.760
I'll order a full tox,
just to be sure.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.880
This is interesting.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.800
There's a mottled bruising pattern
across her right palm.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.640
What could have done that?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.800
Perhaps she was trying to grab
something while she was struggling.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.120
It's an unusual mark.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.680
Let's remove her clothing
and see what else we can find.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.200
What could that be from?

09:29.200 --> 09:31.240
Given its shape
and position on the body,

09:31.240 --> 09:32.920
I'd say a knee.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.480
From the force of the killer's
body weight?

09:35.480 --> 09:38.080
As she was being held down, yes.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.400
But there are no scratches
on her arms,

09:40.400 --> 09:43.440
no other bruises
or defence wounds that I can see.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.680
Yeah, and no sign of sexual trauma.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.320
But...she did have unprotected sex
at some point in the last 24 hours.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.520
Hmm. Then it may have been
consensual.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.040
Has CIB sent through Aaron Sharpe's
criminal record yet?

09:58.040 --> 10:00.360
There wasn't anything to send.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.960
What, no history of violence?

10:01.960 --> 10:05.520
No speeding tickets, no unpaid
parking fines, nothing.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.000
On paper, Aaron Sharpe is a saint.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.120
But you're not convinced.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.280
Well, you saw how he reacted
back at the house.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.400
He shut down, wouldn't look at us,
talk to anyone.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.920
The actions of a guilty man?

10:18.920 --> 10:20.760
We both know that
in most domestic killings,

10:20.760 --> 10:22.760
it's usually the partner
who's responsible.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.720
And in most cases,
the abuse is ongoing

10:25.720 --> 10:27.960
but you saw her CT scan -

10:27.960 --> 10:30.720
there were no healed bones,
no broken teeth,

10:30.720 --> 10:34.960
no other injuries that would suggest
ongoing physical abuse.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.320
But that doesn't discount
psychological or emotional abuse.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.600
I'll get a fast-track on those swabs.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.600
See if we can get a match
from the DNA database.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.560
Has Aaron Sharpe said
anything to the cops yet?

10:49.560 --> 10:51.360
Not a bloody word.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.520
He hasn't confirmed
or denied anything.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.680
Hasn't asked for a lawyer.
Hasn't even touched his sandwich.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.400
Yeah, mind you,
those vending machine sandwiches

10:59.400 --> 11:00.720
can be a bit iffy.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.720
Did you speak to his employer?
Yep.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.240
Turns out Mr Sharpe only partially
completed his deliveries.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.360
No-one knows where he was
between 2:00 and 6:00am.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.040
Did you track his phone?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.840
Left it in his locker at work.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.520
And get this -

11:15.520 --> 11:18.600
some of the female staff
had recently complained about him.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.320
Didn't like how quiet he was.
Creeped 'em out a bit.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.000
So, the boss puts him on night shift
but that wasn't his only job.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.960
He'd work at a servo during the day

11:27.960 --> 11:30.640
and then he'd wash dishes
at a restaurant on the weekends.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.800
He'd often work 18 hours straight.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.480
His partner hadn't worked
in 12 months.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.080
Yeah, well, she quit her job
after a minor car accident.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.160
Claimed she hurt her neck
and couldn't work.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.280
But she's chasing a compensation
payout that's not forthcoming.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.760
Do you mind if I have a go?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.760
Did you know the 'Sirene'

11:56.760 --> 12:00.560
was the first ship
in the French fleet to carry 40 guns?

12:02.440 --> 12:07.480
And when she was attacked by the HMS
'Agile' off the coast of Martinique,

12:07.480 --> 12:10.680
her captain deliberately
beached the ship,

12:10.680 --> 12:13.160
saving the lives of her 84 crew,

12:13.160 --> 12:14.840
most of whom couldn't swim.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.360
Luckily, she was also

12:17.360 --> 12:20.560
the first ship in the French fleet
to carry life buoys

12:20.560 --> 12:22.160
but that wasn't until...

12:22.160 --> 12:23.560
1812.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.760
My father had a model
of the 'Agile' in his study.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.720
Not as well crafted as the ones
in your living room

12:32.720 --> 12:35.160
but...he loved that ship.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.200
Did Jade like your ships?

12:39.200 --> 12:42.600
She didn't think I had time
to work on them.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.240
Because of your jobs?

12:45.280 --> 12:50.120
How did it make you feel, to work
18 hours a day, seven days a week?

12:50.120 --> 12:52.080
I did it by choice.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.320
Why didn't Jade work?

12:54.320 --> 12:56.240
She couldn't.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.720
Was it the accident?

13:02.960 --> 13:07.480
You said at the house
that Jade broke your ship.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.480
Were you there when she broke it?

13:15.120 --> 13:18.920
Aaron, did you hurt Jade?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.800
I loved her.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.920
Yes, I know. Of course I will.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.800
I'm very aware why I was hired
for the job, Doug,

13:38.800 --> 13:41.120
but you need to let me
handle this my way.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.040
Aaah! Oh! Renee, I am sorry.

14:00.040 --> 14:04.520
Just warming up my vocal cords
for a rehearsal this afternoon.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.200
Mm-hm. Mm.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.600
Look, I won't keep you but I need
those reports you made on Dr Harrow,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.080
as a supervisor.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.160
So soon? I wasn't expecting
to deliver those...

14:16.160 --> 14:18.200
I'd like them on my desk
this afternoon.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.200
Here's those scans you were after.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.680
Thank you.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.680
Aaron Sharpe's case file?
Yes.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.280
But there's no medical history.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.040
What do you want it for?

14:39.040 --> 14:43.800
Well, I was wondering if he'd been
diagnosed with some form of autism.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.840
You think he might be
on the spectrum?

14:45.840 --> 14:48.400
He does have difficulty
engaging people,

14:48.400 --> 14:50.760
he can't look anyone in the eye

14:50.760 --> 14:53.440
and has a clear obsession with boats.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.000
Mm, that can be problematic.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.280
I know how it sounds

14:59.280 --> 15:01.960
but I just want to know
why he's not talking to the police.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.000
(KNOCKS AT DOOR) Results are in.

in the neck wounds,

15:06.600 --> 15:09.160
which matches with the semen
found on the victim.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.680
CIB have run it through
the national database and, uh...

15:11.680 --> 15:13.160

No.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.440
Oh, for...
What the hell are you doing here?

15:34.440 --> 15:37.520
Ah, I was passing by and spotted
my favourite surly detective

15:37.520 --> 15:39.400
and thought,
"I must stop and say hi."

15:39.400 --> 15:41.520
We are trying to apprehend
a potential suspect.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.280
Tony Palladino, yes. Multiple
convictions for GBH and assault.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.080
Which is exactly why you shouldn't
be here. He could be dangerous.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.760
I thought you would have
detained him by now.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.240
Jesus Christ, Harrow!

15:51.240 --> 15:52.880
There's a little thing
called 'due process',

and keep out of the bloody way.

Well, don't I always?
Smart-arse.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.800
Sarge, you'd better
take a look at this.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.160
That's our guy. Tony Palladino.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.360
Looks like the jack failed.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.880
Do you think he might have bumped it
as he was reaching for that bottle?

16:36.240 --> 16:37.840
Yeah, looks that way.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.920
Jeez, he's been here a while,
by the smell of him.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.160
At least 19 hours.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.400
How can you be so sure?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.600
Look at his medial canthus.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.360
His what?
The inner corners of his eye.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.520
What is it - maggots?

17:05.520 --> 17:08.520
The newborn larvae
of the green bottle fly,

17:08.520 --> 17:10.760
which take precisely
19 hours to hatch

17:10.760 --> 17:12.800
after the female has laid her eggs.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.240
So, you're telling me
this guy was dead

17:15.240 --> 17:17.440
before Jade Freeman was strangled?

17:17.440 --> 17:20.080
Well, I would get Entomology
to confirm

17:20.080 --> 17:23.920
but this man did not kill
Jade Freeman.

17:25.440 --> 17:31.160
Can you confirm that the man in
these photographs is Tony Palladino?

17:34.400 --> 17:39.200
Now, he was a friend to yourself
and Jade Freeman. Is that correct?

17:46.640 --> 17:48.320
Mr Sharpe, were you aware

17:48.320 --> 17:50.440
that Mr Palladino and Jade
were sleeping together?

17:52.040 --> 17:54.960
We found messages
on Mr Palladino's phone

17:54.960 --> 17:58.080
that suggest they were having
an affair for quite some time.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.720
Were you aware of that?

18:03.240 --> 18:05.160
What does it matter?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.680
Well, it matters
because Mr Palladino

18:08.680 --> 18:11.080
was found dead in his home
this afternoon

18:11.080 --> 18:13.240
and Dr Harrow has confirmed
time of death

18:13.240 --> 18:15.800
to be several hours
before Jade was strangled.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.440
So, have you got any idea
how that might have happened?

18:23.960 --> 18:26.040
Aaron,

18:26.040 --> 18:28.880
we're trying to find out
what happened to Jade

18:28.880 --> 18:32.160
but we can't do that
unless you tell us what you know.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.440
Of course I knew.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.480
OK.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.240
How long have you known?

18:49.120 --> 18:53.360
Mr Sharpe, after you found out Tony
and Jade were sleeping together,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.520
did you confront Mr Palladino
and kill him

18:55.520 --> 18:57.360
and then strangle your girlfriend?

19:05.960 --> 19:09.160
Will you answer the question,
please, Mr Sharpe?

19:12.040 --> 19:13.800
The one thing I don't understand

19:13.800 --> 19:18.080
is how Tony Palladino's DNA
ended up on Jade Freeman's throat

19:18.080 --> 19:21.040
when he was dead
hours before she was strangled.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.960
Well, we know they had sex
before he died, right?

19:23.960 --> 19:26.520
So, maybe the DNA transfer
could have come from that.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.400
On her neck?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.880
Well, maybe he had his hands
around her neck. I don't know.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.560
But if Aaron was responsible, why
didn't we find his DNA on her neck?

19:35.560 --> 19:38.080
I don't know. Maybe he wore gloves.
Hmm.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.720
We found scratch marks.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.440
Whoever killed Jade Freeman
used their bare hands.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.120
Yeah, well, check the swabs again.
Maybe the lab missed something.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.200
Oh!
Well, come on.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.240
You heard what the neighbours said.

19:49.240 --> 19:52.040
Aaron and Jade had arguments
all the time.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.160
He knew about the affair, he has
no alibi for the night in question

19:55.160 --> 19:58.600
and the one thing he's not saying
is that he didn't do it.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.880
But that doesn't mean that he did.

20:00.880 --> 20:04.560
Oh. OK. I know you think
there has to be more to this.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.240
But I'm not so sure.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.880

trying to move on, Grace.

and I got the job up here,

from somewhere.

You're releasing Max Zoric?

24:52.560 --> 24:54.040
Why?

24:54.040 --> 24:57.200
Because the authorisation
came through this afternoon.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.680
But the police are still
investigating his death.

all the evidence required.

No!

25:09.480 --> 25:11.160
I don't.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.320
He's not your son, so why does it
matter so much to you?

25:17.720 --> 25:20.320
Because I'm afraid my actual son

might have something to do
with this boy's death.

What, and you think
he might have killed...

I don't know. I hope not.

to prove my son didn't.

a ton of shit down on you and Fern.

then don't do anything.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.560
There must be a mistake.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.880
Aaron's not a killer!

28:18.880 --> 28:21.320
He loved Jade
and Tony was his friend.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.200
He had no reason
to hurt either of them.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.680
That...may not be the case.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.040
We found evidence that Mr Palladino
and Jade were having an affair.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.560
Well, then maybe it was Tony
that killed her.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.600
I'm afraid that's not possible.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.680
Mr Palladino also died
hours before Jade.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.320
No!

28:44.320 --> 28:46.280
Look, please, sit down.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.960
I...

28:47.960 --> 28:50.760
Look...you've spoken to Aaron.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.240
You-you've seen what he's like.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.600
He's...he's...quiet. He's shy.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.480
He's not a violent person!

28:57.480 --> 29:00.480
The neighbours said that they heard
arguing coming from the house.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.320
That would have been Jade
yelling at Aaron.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.000
She was always on his back,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.080
making him work all the time
so she didn't have to.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.360
But...Jade couldn't work, could she?
Because of the car accident.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.000
She liked not working. She liked
that my brother did everything.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.880
Look, I know him.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.000
He would never hurt her.
He loved her.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.360
(SIGHS) As far as the police
are concerned,

29:22.360 --> 29:24.160
it looks like Aaron did it.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.200
Then you have to check again!

29:26.200 --> 29:27.800
Please.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.760
There must be a mistake.

29:39.440 --> 29:43.400
Harrow! I didn't know you had
such a keen interest in maggots.

29:43.400 --> 29:48.520
Oh, yes - maggots, slugs,
cockroaches, bedbugs...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
My father didn't let me have a dog.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.920
Well. A good thing too.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.800
Because it seems you were right.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.880
Based on the size of the larvae
you collected,

29:58.880 --> 30:01.000
Entomology have confirmed

30:01.000 --> 30:05.840
that Mr Palladino died at least
19 hours before his body was found.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.760
They were hatchlings,
just as you said.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.520
So, there is no way he could have
killed Jade Freeman.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.080
Correct.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.520
Did Scientific find any fingerprints
on that jack?

30:15.520 --> 30:18.200
Yeah, there were several
of Mr Palladino's on there

30:18.200 --> 30:20.600
but there was another set as well.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
Whose?
Aaron Sharpe's.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.840
Look, I know you want to see
this young man acquitted...

30:28.840 --> 30:32.440
No. What I want is to find the truth.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.800
Jade Freeman was murdered brutally

30:35.800 --> 30:38.840
and if Aaron Sharpe did it,
then he should account for it.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.280
But if someone else did it
and gets away with it,

30:41.280 --> 30:43.680
then that would make
an awful death even worse.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.840
Well, you also found evidence

30:47.840 --> 30:52.240
that Tony Palladino was the only
person to have touched Jade's neck

30:52.240 --> 30:55.640
and, yet, we know he was dead,
so that can't be the whole story.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.160
Although I can't see
how that would explain

30:59.160 --> 31:01.240
Aaron Sharpe's prints on that jack.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.200
(OBJECTS CLATTER)

31:30.720 --> 31:32.920
What are you doing?
Oh.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.600
Uh, are you with the police?

31:36.040 --> 31:38.480
I'm from the Coroner's office.
Well, I haven't done anything wrong.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.840
I'm just returning some things

31:39.840 --> 31:41.240
that I borrowed
for a barbecue that we had.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.960
And you thought it appropriate

31:42.960 --> 31:44.920
to break into a crime scene
to put them back?

31:44.920 --> 31:47.960
Well, I didn't want anyone to think
that I'd stolen anything,

31:47.960 --> 31:50.480
not after what had happened
to poor Jade.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.400
I thought the police
might think that...

31:52.400 --> 31:54.160
Might think that you were involved?

31:57.760 --> 32:02.280
You told the police that you often
heard yelling coming from the house.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.880
Aaron's sister told me that
the arguments were usually one way,

32:05.880 --> 32:08.400
that it was Jade yelling at Aaron.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.120
Is this true?

32:10.120 --> 32:12.120
Well, I suppose it's true.

32:12.120 --> 32:15.120
She was always going on about
his work and his model boats.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.280
Who lent you those?

32:19.280 --> 32:21.360
Was it Jade?
Um, Aaron.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.200
He never seemed to have
time or money

32:23.200 --> 32:25.960
but if you needed anything,
he was the first to give it to you.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.120
He'd lend anything
to anyone who asked.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.520
It was Aaron's jack!

32:40.520 --> 32:41.880
What?

32:41.880 --> 32:44.200
The jack we found
in Tony Palladino's garage.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.680
It was Aaron's.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.440
He lent it to him, which explains
why his prints are all over it.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.720
So?

32:49.720 --> 32:52.920
So, there's a possibility
he might not have killed Tony.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.320
Bit of a stretch. It still doesn't
explain how Jade died.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.400
No, but...

32:57.400 --> 32:59.960
It certainly doesn't change the fact
that Aaron's still not denying it.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.720
I understand that but...
Nah, sorry, Harrow.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.200
I know you're not convinced
about this bloke

33:03.200 --> 33:06.080
but you're really gonna have to come
up with something better than that.

Yes.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.720
I was wondering if your team

34:22.720 --> 34:25.680
found a toothbrush
in Mr Palladino's bathroom,

34:25.680 --> 34:27.440
or perhaps collected it as evidence

34:27.440 --> 34:29.680
when Scientific were
at the house yesterday.

34:29.680 --> 34:31.880
OK. Let me see if it's been logged.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.680
(STARTS CAR)
Sorry, Doc.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.360
Nobody's logged any toothbrushes.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.880
Thank you.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.960
Haven't you done that already?
Yes.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.840
But this time,
I'm not looking for DNA.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.160
What are you looking for?

34:58.160 --> 35:02.720
Lauryl sulfate, sorbitol,
sodium fluoride and...mint.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.520
Toothpaste?

35:06.480 --> 35:09.280
Tony Palladino's toothbrush
was missing from his house.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.960
So?

35:10.960 --> 35:13.080
Do you know what would be
on a toothbrush?

35:13.080 --> 35:16.000
Toothpaste and DNA.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.280
So, you think the person
who killed Jade Freeman

35:19.280 --> 35:22.000
stole a toothbrush
from Tony Palladino's house

35:22.000 --> 35:24.800
and used it to transfer DNA
onto her throat.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.040
Yes.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.320
That person planted
Tony Palladino's DNA on Ms Freeman

35:30.320 --> 35:33.120
to make us think
that he was the killer

35:33.120 --> 35:36.960
but there was one little thing
they missed.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.200
They didn't know
he was already dead.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.480
Do you think Aaron
could have done this?

35:41.480 --> 35:43.960
Well, it would have taken
some planning.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.680
Well, he built those boats.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.680
He's clearly capable
and he knew where Tony lived.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.880
And he had motive, no alibi
and knew both victims.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.560
But you're still not
convinced about him.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.080
I'm still not convinced
we've found the truth.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.880
And Jade Freeman deserves that.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.440

strangled Jade Freeman to death.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.520
It's how you got the mark
on the back of your neck.

38:45.080 --> 38:48.720
I found the same mark on Jade's hand.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.120
She grabbed your necklace,
didn't she?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.920
Ripped it from your neck

38:52.920 --> 38:56.480
while you had your hands
around her throat.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.920
Why did you kill her, Naomi?

39:03.920 --> 39:07.440
Because of the way you thought
she treated your brother?

39:07.440 --> 39:10.840
Making him work three jobs
while she did nothing.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.120
You hated that and you hated her

39:14.120 --> 39:17.800
and when you found out that she was
sleeping with Tony Palladino,

39:17.800 --> 39:19.680
well, that was too much.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.920
So what did you do?

39:22.920 --> 39:25.120
You waited outside their house

39:25.120 --> 39:26.680
until Jade got home,

39:26.680 --> 39:30.160
seething about how she mistreated
your brother,

39:30.160 --> 39:33.280
and when she finally did get home,
around 4:00 in the morning,

39:33.280 --> 39:35.160
you confronted her.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.840
Did you threaten to tell Aaron
what you knew?

39:41.840 --> 39:43.600
Yes.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.640
She told me to piss off.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.080
She said that it was
none of my business.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.240

get away with it.

But Daniel Harrow is one of the
finest pathologists in the state,

45:10.640 --> 45:12.560
if not the country.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.520
But mainly the state.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.320
And, yes, he...he is difficult
to work with.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.720
Yes, he breaks the rules.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.560
But he always gets results,

45:23.560 --> 45:26.040
because he cares.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.920
Sometimes too much.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.480
But that's what sets him apart
from the rest of us.

45:32.560 --> 45:34.400
He's also my friend

45:34.400 --> 45:36.320
and I will not be party
to any decision

45:36.320 --> 45:38.560
that sees him removed
from this building.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.360
Too far?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.040
No. Not at all.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.440
You've made your position
very clear.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.720
Thank you, Dr Fairley.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.440
Right.

You know it?
Know it?!

the Science Squad Cosplay Society,

Not yet.

46:39.360 --> 46:41.280
Just got here.
You OK?

46:41.280 --> 46:42.800
Nervous?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.920
Yes and...yes.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.600
Don't worry. You're gonna kill it.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.800
Call me when you're done, yeah?

46:52.120 --> 46:53.960
Again with this shit?

46:53.960 --> 46:56.920
First you hack into Harrow's email,
now the police system?

46:56.920 --> 46:58.800
What have you got Fern involved in?

46:58.800 --> 47:01.480
I'm just looking after myself.
Yeah, that I believe.

47:01.480 --> 47:04.640
I don't care if you go to jail
but if you get Fern into trouble...

47:05.840 --> 47:07.520
..you'll want to be behind bars.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.160
She believes me.
She wants to believe you.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.720
I think you're full of shit.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.120
Come here!

47:18.120 --> 47:20.520
Ooh. What are you gonna do?

47:20.520 --> 47:22.000

48:25.880 --> 48:28.240
Is there a problem?
Not sure.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.960
Ah. There we go.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.480
Bit slow today.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.640
Can I get you to sign that, please?

48:49.480 --> 48:51.200
Wait, miss?

It's his sister's phone.

Charge them with obstructing justice
and go from there.

But Mila Zoric has him.
