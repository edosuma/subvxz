WEBVTT

00:04.380 --> 00:08.039
before you do anything rash,I think
you should know that I have the cipher.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.050
I handt over right now.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.590
Don't you think we should
discuss terms first?

00:16.340 --> 00:18.740
now... who are you?

00:18.840 --> 00:21.340
You know what?You probably
wouldn't believe me.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.910
Last chance.

00:24.010 --> 00:26.050
Who are you?

00:26.290 --> 00:27.690
Chuck.

00:27.790 --> 00:31.440
Okay.Now,tell me everything,chuck.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.640
- There is no way he's going to believe me.
- And I don't blame him.

00:35.750 --> 00:40.030
I mean,who would believe that the government put all
their secrets into one super computer--the intersect.

00:40.130 --> 00:42.780
And all those secrets got
downloaded into my brain.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.560
of course I can't tell this guy that.

00:45.670 --> 00:50.470
O-okay,okay.Okay,see th-the thing is
I-I kind of sort of work for the cia

00:50.590 --> 00:52.870
and the nsa in my off hours when
I'm not working at the store.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.070
It's kind of like a second job for me.

00:54.170 --> 00:56.390
And though I don't look
it-- being lanky of build¡ª

00:56.470 --> 01:02.980
you should know that I'm probably the most
important intelligence asset In the world.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.760
That is the single dumbest
story I've ever heard.

01:06.820 --> 01:10.400
That very well may
be,but... if you drop me,

01:10.520 --> 01:14.590
there are a couple of people who
are going to be very,very upset.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.480
meet sarah and casey.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.850
They're here to protect me.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.340
At th's sarah.She works for the cia.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.460
Believe me,I know.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.040
And that's casey.He works for the nsa.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.240
He's not as pretty.

01:28.310 --> 01:29.690
Let eke ge go!

01:29.760 --> 01:31.660
Wait!Not out the window.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.280
Aren't we picky.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.820
nice hands,casey.

01:40.980 --> 01:42.700
Why didn't you stay in the car?

01:42.790 --> 01:44.050
You know what?

01:44.140 --> 01:46.610
It's never safe in the car.

01:51.590 --> 01:53.160
Well,did you get it?

01:54.350 --> 01:55.580
Tell me you got it.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.030
I got it.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.210
'Course I got it.It's me.

02:01.130 --> 02:04.130
Excellent work,sarah,casey.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.550
Our transporters will be taking
the cipher out of los angeles.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.560
General,what exactly is the cipher?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.800
I mean,mercenaries
break into the nsa lab,

02:11.840 --> 02:13.800
and it's the only thing they take?

02:13.880 --> 02:19.220
The cipher is the artificial brain
for the new intersect computer.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.340
The new intersect?

02:22.410 --> 02:26.320
We've been working on a new one ever
since the original intersect was destroyed.

02:26.370 --> 02:28.080
The cipher is the final piece.

02:28.180 --> 02:30.450
Uh,wait,time out just for a second here.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.150
What-what happens to
me,the old intersect?

02:33.200 --> 02:38.990
Tomorrow,the new computer will be online,and
operation bartowski officially comes to an end.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.580
You'll be done with us.

02:40.700 --> 02:45.190
No more briefings,no more
missions,no more spies.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.030
Enjoy the rest of your life,chuck.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.070
Are you okay,chuck?

02:56.540 --> 02:59.530
Yeah,I'm,uh,uh... I
mean,I-I don't believe it

02:59.630 --> 03:02.440
but-but,uh,I-I
think I'm great!

03:02.930 --> 03:05.160
You're going to get your old life back.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.800
Yeah,I was starting to think that you and casey
were going to be my spy protectors forever.

03:08.870 --> 03:11.320
Or,whatever the adult
version of forever is.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.120
Don't tell me you're
going to miss all of this.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.660
No.No,of course not.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.710
I don't think I'm really cut out for a job where you
disarm a bomb,steal a diamond,and then jump off a building.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.160
Well,you could have fooled me.

03:21.210 --> 03:25.810
That's very kind of you to say,but I'm pretty sure
my girlish screams in the face of danger give me away.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.050
So,what happens now?

03:32.180 --> 03:34.390
You're almost free.What
are you going to do next?

03:34.480 --> 03:36.240
Well,you know I got the buy more...

03:36.360 --> 03:39.610
- chuck,can I tell you something?
- Of course.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.730
You can do anything.I've
seen you in action.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.800
And I'm not just talking about the
bomb defusing,or the diamond stealing.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.910
I mean,anything you
wanted,you could have.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.470 --> 04:04.190
- I thought you might call.
- Major casey,you understand the situation?

04:04.510 --> 04:09.020
We can't have another intersect wandering
around los angeles getting into trouble.

04:09.060 --> 04:12.900
General,chuck may be a novice spy,but
the results speak for themselves.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.010
Surely we can find
another exit strategy.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.360
You have your orders,major.

04:17.410 --> 04:21.940
Tomorrow night,eliminate
chuck bartowski.

04:30.790 --> 04:32.800
I used to like the sound of that.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.220
morning,chuck.

05:54.870 --> 05:57.390
My eyes!My eyes!

05:57.520 --> 06:00.050
Oh,I'm blind!I'm blind!

06:09.670 --> 06:11.420
Okay,first of all,congratulations,devon.

06:11.540 --> 06:14.170
On the... on what-- you know
whatever god gave you there.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.630
Second of all,the door was not
locked,so I'm not a complete pervert.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.940
And third of all,this is just another
reminder of why I need my own place.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.890
There's no rush,chuck.It's
great having you here.

06:23.860 --> 06:28.570
So,ellie,I've been,I've been thinking a lot
about stuff,you know,like,uh,my life and my job.

06:28.650 --> 06:31.000
Unburden yourself,chuck--
where's that head of yours?

06:31.070 --> 06:32.350
I don't know,I just think
you guys are right,you know?

06:32.460 --> 06:36.030
I shouldn't,I shouldn't be working at a buy
more,right?I should have a real job with a real future.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.780
What happened?

06:38.070 --> 06:39.920
You know when you meet someone
and they just kind of,you know,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.120
they-they flip you on your head,just
shake things up,a little bit?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.960
You're talking about a mr.Tony robbins.

06:46.090 --> 06:48.510
So close.And yet so far away.Honestly.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.770
- I got to go.I'm sorry.We'll talk about it later.
- No,no.

06:50.850 --> 06:53.500
Talk to me,chuck; I need to know if
this is a good thing or a bad thing.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.590
No,no,it's A... it's a good thing.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.630
It's a very-- it's not a tony
robbins cult thing.I want this,so.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.150
Okay.Okay,great,well,then
I'm really happy for you.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.820
I'm,like,super excited right now,and
I'm just trying to keep it in.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.490
Of course.So... which
is healthier,I think.

07:07.620 --> 07:08.500
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.380
I'm so proud of you!

07:10.510 --> 07:12.500
okay,I love you.See ya.

07:36.730 --> 07:38.760
Chuck,come here.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.330
What's up,buddy?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.950
Large mart goons; c theyould be
anywhere.I don't want them to see this.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.530
What is this?

07:48.120 --> 07:49.930
Compound level from call of duty.

07:50.030 --> 07:53.540
After our last battle with those large
mart douches,I started to work on this.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.050
Planning how we could take 'em all out.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.230
All right,listen up.Here
are the specs,are you ready?

07:57.320 --> 08:00.810
23 infantry troopers,16 snipers,seven
heavy gunners,four demolitions experts,

08:00.870 --> 08:05.010
and enough ammunition to orbit arnold
schwarzenegger.50 gamers,one call,all ready for battle.

08:05.130 --> 08:09.110
With this team assembled,and
my plan,I think we can beat 'em.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.360
Morgan,you are my new hero.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.840
I know.I know.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.370
Uh,hey,uh,can I talk to you
about this later?Uh,roger that.

08:16.510 --> 08:19.510
Oh,big mike was looking for you.I told him I
would send you his way as soon as you arrived.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.410
Message delivevered.Your
work here is done.

08:21.490 --> 08:23.350
Hey,casey,casey,casey,casey,casey.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.630
Um,do you have a second?Just
a quick,quick second.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.990
Not now,I've got a single white
female pining for the beastmaster.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.610
It's a quick-- it's justqu
a ick second I promise.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.350
What is it?

08:33.799 --> 08:36.110
Just wanted to say thank you.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.760
I'm leaving.No,hey,hey,wait,wait,wait.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.390
- Hand.
- Sorry.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.130
I was-- forget
about that.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.950
Um,look,I just... I just want
to say I'm going to miss you,man.

08:46.030 --> 08:48.540
You know,and-and-and thank you
for showing me how to do things

08:48.610 --> 08:52.220
that I never thought were
possible,and,and you know what?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.800
You were always there
to catch me when I fell,

08:54.880 --> 08:57.550
which sounds horribly cheesy
now that I'm saying it aloud.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.870
Really.Forget it.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.140
Bartowski!

09:03.320 --> 09:05.030
Bartowski,bartowski.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.950
- Yes,big mike?
- The assistant managership.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.890
The number-two spot here at
the buy more,my right-hand man,

09:10.950 --> 09:15.480
the captain of the ship when I'm not
around,which,as we both know,is often.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.600
Here's the thing-- corporate
is on my ass to fill the spot,

09:19.640 --> 09:22.600
but I really don't want to
interview those characters out there.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.130
- Your employees?
- Exactly,they scare me,chuck.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.990
So...

09:30.950 --> 09:32.730
...want the job?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.420
Well,chuck,do you?

09:41.780 --> 09:45.230
all hail the once and future
assistant manager-- chuck bartowski!

09:45.490 --> 09:46.980
The sleeper has awoken!

09:47.050 --> 09:49.480
Morgan... behold the dawn of
a new age here at the buy more.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.500
I,as your lieutenant,will institute
policies that we've have always wanted.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.870
Right,team?

09:54.030 --> 09:55.920
- Hooray.
- Hurrah.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.550
Morgan,I didn't take the job.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.960
What?Why,oh,why,oh,why,chuck?

10:01.040 --> 10:04.610
I'm also here to inform you that
big mike has ordered me to interview

10:04.660 --> 10:07.870
and choose the new assistant
store manager as my punishment.

10:07.910 --> 10:09.850
- References go to you,charles?
- Or morgan!

10:09.960 --> 10:11.480
See ya; I got a resum?to nail.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.580
If I get the job,you
should quiver in fear.

10:14.770 --> 10:17.160
Listen to me,listen to
me.Chuck,chuck,you being the A.M.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.220
And me being the right hand to the
A.M.Was what we always dreamed of.

10:19.330 --> 10:23.560
I'm not,I'm not completely convinced that the
buy more is where I want to work forever,you know.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.650
Got it.Where would we work then?

10:25.810 --> 10:28.330
Where would... where would we... we?

10:28.940 --> 10:30.970
Uh,I don't know.Wherever.

10:31.070 --> 10:33.160
It's sarah,right?She's finally done it.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.640
No,what,done what?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.750
You know,it makes perfect
sense,too,come to think of it.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.910
I mean,if you were going to choose someone over
me and all that we've built,it should be her.

10:39.960 --> 10:44.150
I mean,she is-- unironically
speaking-- awesome.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.760
So can I be completely honest?

11:12.850 --> 11:14.560
- Yeah.
- I miss the wienerlicious.

11:14.690 --> 11:17.940
I mean,the bavarian charm and the toxic
nacho cheese that you guys had there.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.900
My clothes smelled like sausage.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.090
Nostalgia completely gone.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.160
So what's up?

11:29.770 --> 11:31.990
You want to go on a date sometime?

11:32.500 --> 11:36.730
I mean a date without aliases
and spy gear and a mission?

11:36.890 --> 11:39.070
Like a real date?

11:39.180 --> 11:40.770
Yeah.

11:41.020 --> 11:46.630
Chuck... I'm still a cia agent,and there are
a hundred reasons why I shouldn't do that.

11:46.730 --> 11:50.860
What do you have to lose?In a week,you're going
to be undercover in some place like jakarta

11:50.980 --> 11:54.210
in a knife fight with some
evil-doer,and in that exact moment,

11:54.290 --> 11:59.950
you're going to wish that you would've
spent one last... night of fun with me.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.190
Okay.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.940
Really?

12:12.980 --> 12:14.690
Tonight.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.890
- Our first real date.
- Or our second first date.

12:17.980 --> 12:19.620
- No gunfight,I promise.
- Okay.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.080
Hey,date tonight?

13:18.160 --> 13:22.300
Yeah,yeah-- we're going to go grab some chinese
food and then maybe hit the echo after that.

13:22.390 --> 13:23.660
Did you hear that,devon?

13:23.790 --> 13:26.650
Do you recognize the sound of
a proper date when you hear it?

13:26.810 --> 13:28.800
My tank's empty,babe.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.780
That's my future husband.

13:30.890 --> 13:34.480
What about you?Any revelations?Any
ideas about what you're going to do next?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.300
Um... yeah,a few.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.870
If you say "pilot the millennium
falcon," I will hit you.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.550
I-- why would
I say that?

13:41.640 --> 13:43.620
That's absurd.I'm going
to be a ninja assassin.

13:43.670 --> 13:45.150
No,try again.

13:45.430 --> 13:48.710
olympic...

13:50.350 --> 13:51.830
Secret agent.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.930
This is what happens when you sit in
front of the television set too long.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.550
Seriously,what are you going to do?

13:57.940 --> 13:59.750
I-I don't know.I've got
a bunch of ideas,you know?

13:59.850 --> 14:02.040
A bunch of things to think
about and choose from.

14:02.090 --> 14:03.920
I mean,I want to go finish college.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.670
I mean,I think that's important.And
I want to travel and... I don't know.

14:07.760 --> 14:12.000
I want to learn an obscure language
that,you know,only really cool people know.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.780
oddly enough,not one of my dreams includes
working at the buy more for another week.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.440
Well,look who's growing up.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.900
that'll be sarah.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.970
What's up,dude?I know you have
a date.Not gonna get in the way.

14:28.100 --> 14:32.550
Just wondering if you have five to 45 minutes
to test out a new call of duty strategy?

14:33.650 --> 14:38.350
- Chuck...
- baby steps,sis.

14:38.740 --> 14:40.940
Baby steps.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.590
yeah?

14:49.710 --> 14:51.010
Messenger.

14:58.970 --> 15:01.170
pickup call placed by one G.Beckman.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.640
- Verification code?
- Morning glory.

15:18.670 --> 15:20.220
Where's your backup?

15:29.810 --> 15:30.840
it's done.

15:30.950 --> 15:32.170
I've got the cipher.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.340
Go to the second location.

15:34.540 --> 15:37.080
We have two more targets.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.600
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

15:50.190 --> 15:51.810
****************

15:51.940 --> 15:53.420
So how'd you hear
about this place,anyway?

15:53.530 --> 15:55.180
Morgan,as a matter of fact.

15:55.350 --> 15:57.350
The man has a black belt in dumplings.

15:57.420 --> 16:01.110
I trust any recommendation he gives me
for food items less than ten dollars.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.480
So our first date is a
morgan recommendation?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.980
Wow,no faith in the
little bearded man.Okay.

16:07.090 --> 16:10.870
I think you should know he's always
been supportive of our fake relationship.

16:11.030 --> 16:16.000
And he's never found it remotely unbelievable
that a guy like me could be dating,um...

16:19.030 --> 16:21.160
- you know.
- What?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.830
Um... you know,you.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.800
What about me?

16:32.490 --> 16:34.690
You're really going to
make me say it,aren't you?

16:34.990 --> 16:37.460
You--
wow,okay.Fine.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.700
All right,we'll play it your way.

16:39.930 --> 16:41.710
A girl like you.

16:42.350 --> 16:45.930
Or more appropriately,a woman like you.

16:46.030 --> 16:49.890
Considering the fact that you could probably
kick the ass of everyone in this joint.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.610
And A... a smart one at that.

16:52.740 --> 16:56.980
Not to mention cool and...

16:57.290 --> 16:59.100
extremely beautiful.

16:59.330 --> 17:02.850
And,and you can stop me anytime with
the compliments if they're becoming,

17:02.960 --> 17:04.329
- you know...
- no.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.410
No,that was very sweet.

17:08.339 --> 17:09.410
Sweet?

17:09.569 --> 17:12.510
Golly gee,thanks for making
me feel like I'm eight.

17:13.589 --> 17:15.550
Well,you're not so bad yourself.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.180
Please.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.160
I'm fantastic.

17:20.609 --> 17:23.079
Yeah.You are.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.540
What would casey think if he
knew we were doing this right now?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.830
It would probably kill him.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.610
sorry,sir.

18:07.630 --> 18:10.520
so does it say where you're,uh,going
next?Your new mission?

18:10.640 --> 18:11.860
Actually,it does.

18:11.930 --> 18:14.610
- Really?
- No,not really.

18:14.740 --> 18:16.230
Besides,it doesn't work that way.

18:16.380 --> 18:20.970
They'll probably give me a new cover,and
move me as far away from here as possible.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.180
What if they didn't?

18:26.490 --> 18:29.970
Chuck,a cia officer
doesn't get to choose.

18:30.130 --> 18:33.130
You know,I-I still have an
awful lot of secrets in my head:

18:33.450 --> 18:37.890
The lindbergh baby, the
formula for new coke...

18:38.380 --> 18:40.730
what are you saying,chuck?

18:40.910 --> 18:43.510
What I've always wanted to say,sarah.

18:47.990 --> 18:51.610
no no no no noNot now.

19:11.220 --> 19:12.680
chuck,what is it?

19:12.840 --> 19:14.620
We're surrounded.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.910
Sarah,you have your gun,right?

19:20.030 --> 19:21.610
- Nope.
- What?Why not?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.860
You don't bring a gun on a real date.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.130
Hello again,chuck.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.870
- And you are?
- My name is mr.Colt.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.710
And I need you to come with me.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.890
Now why would we do that,mr.Colt?

19:33.010 --> 19:36.040
'Cause I assume you find me imposing.

19:36.190 --> 19:37.740
Don't worry,be honest.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.330
I'm going for imposing.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.590
Mission accomplished.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.180
Well,I'll tell you what.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.750
The people that hired me...
give me the heebie-jeebies.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.160
You know,when you put it
in context like that,I-I...

19:49.270 --> 19:51.690
let's go.We'll take care of the check.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.270
Um,you know,are you sure? let's go.The
moo goo gai pan is very expensive here,

19:55.370 --> 19:57.560
so we could probably
go dutch or something.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.120
How much do bad guys normally tip?

20:00.960 --> 20:03.530
- sarah.
- Move and she dies.

20:05.590 --> 20:06.860
what is that?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.590
It's a honing device.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.480
Is that a crown victoria?

20:13.660 --> 20:15.100
Move!

20:19.200 --> 20:23.010
- Somebody order
drive-thru?- Go!Go!

20:26.650 --> 20:29.480
- Casey,drive!
- *****

20:36.710 --> 20:38.660
Somebody order drive-thru,huh?

20:38.770 --> 20:40.580
Yo did u think that up as you
were racing over to save us?

20:40.650 --> 20:43.130
"Hey,maybe I'll say this after
I crash into the restaurant!

20:43.200 --> 20:45.340
"Casey,we have to go back and
find out who they work for.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.150
Too many of 'em,we can'T.

20:47.270 --> 20:49.670
Well,at least we still have the cipher.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.180
Yeah,about that...

20:52.820 --> 20:55.260
looks like you're still
the intersect,chuck.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.510
- Sarah...
- don't worry,chuck.

20:58.610 --> 21:00.440
We'll get it back.

21:58.030 --> 22:01.040
Yo,chuck.Got all the
resum together for you.

22:01.860 --> 22:02.970
What?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.350
The assistant manager spot.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.630
You have to pick our boss,man.

22:07.090 --> 22:08.850
you know what,morgan?I'm
making my decision right now.

22:08.980 --> 22:10.530
I want you to be the assistant manager.

22:10.710 --> 22:12.910
Choa,uck,relax.

22:13.130 --> 22:14.100
Let's think about this.

22:14.210 --> 22:17.620
See,I have this perfect system for
doing as little work as possible.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.090
It's a science,really,doing nothing.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.140
A promotion at this point
would destroy all my hard work.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.240
You're telling me I have no choice.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.720
The die has been cast.

22:26.860 --> 22:29.370
- But I'm gonna be here every step of the way.
- That's comforting.

22:29.580 --> 22:33.540
Okay,so the first
interview up is... anna wu.

22:35.270 --> 22:40.820
um,okay,anna,well,your-your resum?has
some really interesting items.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.510
- Is it true that you're trained in the art of...
- tell him to leave.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.250
- I'm sorry,what?
- Orll mgan to leave.

22:51.750 --> 22:54.210
I'm just trying to find the
right applicant,buddy,that's all.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.840
- It's scented.
- Is it?

22:55.960 --> 22:59.180
Rose.oh,honey,would you close the door?

22:59.420 --> 23:01.760
Thank you.Thanks,sugar.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.880
We're alone.

23:09.630 --> 23:12.450
Anna,what exactly are you doing?

23:12.570 --> 23:13.630
X.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.970
Rela I like making my boyfriend nervous.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.830
Howdy.Howdy.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.080
What is this?Is this trash?Am
I supposed to throw this away?

23:22.220 --> 23:24.160
It's my resum?

23:27.020 --> 23:31.430
You-you've,uh,you've been working
here since the store opened?

23:31.580 --> 23:32.940
Very detailed.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.550
Very thorough.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.820
I'm noticing here that you
have a wikipedia entry...

23:37.890 --> 23:39.390
bingo.

23:40.230 --> 23:41.690
...Of yourself.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.910
I have a certain following.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.590
What do you think he thinks
is happening in here right now?

23:49.780 --> 23:51.480
An interview,I hope.

23:51.570 --> 23:58.460
Well,um,you know,that's actually something
that I never,ever wanted to know about you.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.180
- What else can I tell you?
- Nothing.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.020
No,no,no,no.Chuck,you know
what?No more questions.

24:02.110 --> 24:04.920
- Guy needs professional help.
- That's not,that's not called for.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.990
Or... or welcome.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.600
Very unwelcome,actually.

24:08.730 --> 24:10.830
I take care of my friends,chuck.

24:10.950 --> 24:16.010
I,uh... I help those who help me.

24:19.030 --> 24:21.910
okay,here's the thing: We're at the
buy more,and this is not the mafia.

24:22.030 --> 24:24.000
Interesting,interesting.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.490
Hey,whoa.Mr.Bartowski's
conducting an interview.

24:26.610 --> 24:30.060
I... That happens a lot.Deserved.

24:38.390 --> 24:41.320
OK Uh,lester,could you
excuse me for a second?

24:41.430 --> 24:43.600
And,morgan,I need to talk
to casey by myself,thanks.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.310
No,yeah,absolutely,it was great.Yeah,take your
resum?Great job,awesome.Get out of here,please.

24:47.420 --> 24:48.690
Morgan,now,now,now!

24:48.780 --> 24:51.110
Move it,move it,move it!Shut the door.

24:52.610 --> 24:54.890
What is it?I know where they are.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.300
- Who?Who?What do you mean,who?
- Colt!

24:57.420 --> 24:59.350
The guy who smashed you
in the face last night.

24:59.460 --> 25:00.780
Yeah,I flashed on your scar.

25:00.910 --> 25:02.400
It's the emblem for their organization.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.140
They have a secret hideout downtown.

25:04.230 --> 25:06.250
Warehouse 17 on 103rd street.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.100
- We'll hop in the herder...
- cool your jets,hotshot.I'll call it in.

25:09.180 --> 25:11.270
What do you mean call it in?There's no
time!They could be on the move already.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.760
Relax.

25:12.860 --> 25:17.010
I'm not gonna rush us into a hideout situation
until I'm absolutely certain we have the upper hand.

25:17.090 --> 25:18.860
We'll get the cipher.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.020
Just might take some time.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.050
Casey,I can't take this anymore.Do
you understand what I'm saying?

25:24.150 --> 25:25.740
I cannot do this anymore!

25:25.790 --> 25:28.950
I almost died twice in the
period of one day,all right?

25:29.000 --> 25:34.850
And when I'm looking at my life and what my future
could be,I see that it doesn't completely suck.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.990
Your intersect,your new
intersect is almost done.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.190
And when it is,I'm free,I'm
cool,I'm clear,I'm out of here.

25:39.310 --> 25:41.390
I have a future and a
life that I want to live.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.920
Future's a dangerous thing,chuck.Doesn't
always work out like you want it to.

25:45.910 --> 25:49.620
What happened to you?You were this close to
being done with me and being a real spy again.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.820
What?You don't you want me
here to catch you when you fall?

25:54.690 --> 25:58.860
No,as a matter of fact,I'd rather have
you flying jets and blowing things up.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.370
Wait here.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.920
- Hey,big guy,
- what about the interviews,pal?

26:10.970 --> 26:13.020
What?Uh,oh,I don't
know,but you're in charge.

26:13.110 --> 26:14.660
No,no,no.I can't,I
can't do the interviews.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.160
I-I don't make decisions like that.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.490
People talk to me,and I just kind
of tune them out and nod my head.

26:18.590 --> 26:20.470
I'd be making the decision blind.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.260
Fine,fine,fine,fine,use
your own method.I trust you.

26:23.390 --> 26:24.630
Really?

26:25.110 --> 26:26.950
That such a good idea?

26:28.820 --> 26:30.530
What is my method?

26:31.110 --> 26:32.880
Hey,what's happening?You're
going down there,aren't you?

26:32.990 --> 26:34.570
We're on it,chuck.

26:34.710 --> 26:37.930
- What-what's back there?- Well,like
the sign says,yogurt and fun.

26:39.770 --> 26:42.180
Let me come along.You got
to bring charles carmichael.

26:42.310 --> 26:46.040
You remember,debonair superspy,who also happens
to have the intersect in his head?You know,me?

26:46.100 --> 26:47.310
I can help you guys.

26:47.390 --> 26:50.370
Charles carmichael isn't your
real name,chuck.You made him up.

26:50.530 --> 26:53.010
You're just chuck bartowski,and
you're not a real spy,huh?

26:53.060 --> 26:55.640
We have a tactical team meeting us
at the location that you gave casey.

26:55.690 --> 26:59.280
We'll take down colt and find the
cipher,and you go back to work.

26:59.340 --> 27:02.280
Don't worry about the buy more.I put
morgan in charge of the job search.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.620
He's got it under control.

27:06.260 --> 27:10.190
Welcome to thunderdome!

27:10.230 --> 27:11.910
It is the ancient way!

27:12.000 --> 27:15.010
To the victor go the spoils!

27:15.110 --> 27:21.690
One of them will be the new assistant
manager and one of them will be jeff!

27:21.760 --> 27:24.620
The fates will decide!

27:24.690 --> 27:26.600
Begin!

27:39.070 --> 27:41.220
anna?Jeff?Lester?

27:41.350 --> 27:42.730
Bartowski!

27:42.870 --> 27:44.240
Computer emergency!

27:44.380 --> 27:45.610
Hey,where is everybody?

27:45.790 --> 27:46.850
Don't care.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.760
Just got a call for nerd herd help.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.460
They said they got a
recommendation for you.

27:50.540 --> 27:52.580
Well,can I send someone else or
did they ask for me specifically?

27:52.660 --> 27:54.350
You know I hate taking calls.

27:54.490 --> 27:56.060
Get going!

28:12.680 --> 28:15.330
Go,go,go,open.Open up.

28:24.260 --> 28:26.610
- **
- Chuck was wrong.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.550
Or he was right,and we
didn't move fast enough.

28:28.660 --> 28:31.740
Buy more nerd herd.Hello.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.450
I'm here about the...

28:36.920 --> 28:38.870
...computer emergency.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.870
Hello,chuck.Come on in.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.440
call chuck.I got a feeling.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.490
Nothing.I'll try buy more.

29:00.750 --> 29:02.900
Morgan,where's chuck?

29:08.250 --> 29:12.200
So,uh,what-what,uh,seems
to be your computer problem?

29:12.310 --> 29:13.610
Here's the problem,chuck.

29:13.690 --> 29:16.000
You saw my face and you heard my voice.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.560
That's not a problem.That's
not a problem at all.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.750
I forget things all the time.Ask
my sister; I forgot her birthday.

29:19.890 --> 29:23.430
I forget my social security number.Just
anything,ask me,I'll forget it.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.320
what exactly are you doing?

29:26.470 --> 29:28.230
I'm stretching,getting limber.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.010
Why are you doing that?

29:30.140 --> 29:32.500
So I won't pull a muscle
when I break your neck.

29:32.580 --> 29:34.570
Maybe you should get limber,too.

29:43.410 --> 29:45.020
Where you going?

29:45.310 --> 29:47.410
There's nobody here to help you.

29:47.540 --> 29:49.490
Oh,your friends,that's right.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.130
They're next on my to do"" list."

29:52.270 --> 29:56.740
See,you walked into a trap,chuck...
if that is your real name.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.710
My name is charles carmichael.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.660
I'm a cia agent,and this is my trap.

30:13.750 --> 30:17.600
I don't think you gentlemen realize the
gravity of the predicament that you're in.

30:17.770 --> 30:20.530
See,that phone call you made to
the buy more?Yeah,we traced that.

30:20.650 --> 30:23.970
Your compound is currently
surrounded by 23 infantry troopers,

30:24.100 --> 30:27.330
16 snipers,seven heavy
gunners,four demolitions experts,

30:27.490 --> 30:30.000
and enough ammunition to
orbit arnold schwarzenegger.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.510
You're outmatched and you're outgunned.

30:31.660 --> 30:35.580
Those peashooters you're holding might as
well be sharp sticks and strong language.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.380
Nothing there,boss.

30:44.530 --> 30:46.140
Looks clear.

30:47.260 --> 30:48.310
good try,chuck.

30:48.460 --> 30:49.520
Of course you don't see anyone.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.180
Who do you think
we are-- the fbi?

30:51.320 --> 30:55.500
The only thing you're going to see is a muzzle
flash,followed by an e-ticket straight to hell.

30:55.580 --> 30:59.650
So make the smart choice and...
why don't you hand over the cipher?

31:01.640 --> 31:03.570
Wait,w-w-wa-wai-wait,wait,wait.

31:05.260 --> 31:09.820
I think that,uh... I think that
you might want to hear this.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.350
hey,chuck.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.980
- Hey,morgan.
- Yeah,yeah,chuck.

31:15.100 --> 31:18.930
Morgan,I'd like you to tell me the exact
specs for the team surrounding the compound.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.560
The whole shebang?

31:20.640 --> 31:21.790
The whole shebang.

31:21.950 --> 31:26.880
Yes,sir,we have 23 infantry troopers,16 snipers,seven
heavy gunners,and four demolitions experts.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.640
I should tell you I got a little impatient
and we took out one of the sentries.

31:29.750 --> 31:32.070
Don't worry,it was a head
shot.He couldn't warn his buddies.

31:32.180 --> 31:35.330
It was awesome,man,you should have seen
it.His head exploded like a watermelon.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.660
- Thanks,morgan.
- They must have got fritz.

31:37.780 --> 31:39.610
I thought he was in the can.

31:40.810 --> 31:42.420
One more time.

31:42.570 --> 31:44.300
Give up.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.250
He's either lying,or he's crazy.

31:50.370 --> 31:51.380
Check everywhere.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.420
Don't let anything get past you.

32:12.110 --> 32:13.640
This is agents casey and walker.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.440
We're en route.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.780
Don't move.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.920
Please,don't move.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.010
hey,no.

32:37.390 --> 32:38.430
Hand it over.

32:38.570 --> 32:40.570
What'll you do if I give it to you?

32:42.230 --> 32:43.720
To be honest,I'm gonna drop you.

32:43.850 --> 32:45.380
See,thi-this is what I'm talking about.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.480
We got to work on your
negotiating skills.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.530
How about this?

32:48.670 --> 32:52.360
How about you pull me back up and we just
discuss this like two rational adults?

32:52.460 --> 32:53.440
You know what?

32:53.550 --> 32:55.450
- What?
- Freeze!

32:58.560 --> 33:00.190
It ain't worth it.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.530
no!

33:11.900 --> 33:14.850
your boyfriend's dead
now,baby.What you gonna do?

33:24.550 --> 33:26.840
- you,you...
- yeah,I catch you when you fall.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.780
- It's touching,really.
- No,no,I love you.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.460
Keep it in your pants,bartowski.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.330
Now get downstairs.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.660
Okay,enough with the foreplay.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.989
Step away from the blonde.

34:09.139 --> 34:11.100
Ah,you know you got
to put that gun down.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.790
Ain't nobody else here.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.659
Meet the rest of my men.Drop it,chief.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.550
excuse me.

34:25.690 --> 34:26.659
Excuse me,hi.

34:26.800 --> 34:33.050
Sorry to,uh... uh,sorry to interrupt
whatever's going on here,but,uh,mr.Colt,

34:33.190 --> 34:36.030
I just wanted you to meet my team.

34:36.170 --> 34:38.460
Tell me something.Do
you find them imposing?

34:38.580 --> 34:40.630
Go ahead,you can be honest.

34:40.790 --> 34:42.800
I was going for imposing.

34:42.949 --> 34:44.130
Chuck.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.739
Carmichael.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.000
Agent carmichael.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.679
Maybe you could go ahead
and put your weapons down.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.420
I said put your weapons down!

34:53.830 --> 34:59.310
Oh,there you go,there you-- and then,and then
the hands up to imply that your hands are empty.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.550
Your boss,carmichael.

35:01.630 --> 35:04.100
- What?
- He's good.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.310
Don't
worry,I-I-I'm fine.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.740
Do you have the cipher?

35:10.840 --> 35:12.190
Please tell me you have it.

35:12.330 --> 35:15.350
Of course I have it.It's me.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.320
major casey.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.720
Hope I'm not interrupting.

35:32.590 --> 35:33.810
The new intersect ready?

35:33.970 --> 35:35.010
We're minutes away.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.950
- Which means...
- your order remains the same.

35:38.060 --> 35:40.960
Chuck bartowski is to be eliminated.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.940
what was that,casey?

35:45.060 --> 35:48.800
Nothing,general.It's just...

35:52.280 --> 35:54.600
chuck's served his country with honor.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.600
Maybe he even has potential as
an analyst for the organization.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.560
- I unders...
- let me,general.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.640
Major casey,can you extract these
secrets from mr.Bartowski's head?

36:03.760 --> 36:07.670
Can you guarantee him safety
from kidnapping,from torture?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.830
- No.
- Then it's clear.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.140
Chuck bartowski has served
his country with honor.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.510
Now he'll die with honor to protect it.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.860
You sure you can handle it?

36:22.990 --> 36:25.330
yeah,yeah,I think i
can do this,thank you.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.440
Plus,I've wanted to cook dinner
for sarah for a while,so...

36:27.540 --> 36:30.130
you have many skills,chuck,but
the kitchen is not one of them.

36:30.270 --> 36:33.010
Oh,but that's why they
call it hamburger helper.

36:33.140 --> 36:36.430
Hello,does most of the
heavy lifting for me.

36:36.710 --> 36:40.310
I'm making that,uh,that chicken with balsamic
glaze,the one thing dad taught me how to make.

36:40.430 --> 36:42.470
But dad couldn't cook either.

36:42.570 --> 36:43.860
Babe,you ready?

36:43.990 --> 36:45.610
Mongolian bbq beckons.

36:45.720 --> 36:48.540
Going for the record,chuck.Seven
pounds,shredded beef.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.020
- I've been fasting.
- Please,let me help you.

36:51.170 --> 36:54.250
The man has been on a hunger
strike.Come on,go eat,I'll be fine.

36:54.390 --> 36:56.200
You sure about that?

36:56.360 --> 36:57.780
Yeah.

36:57.890 --> 36:59.520
Yes,I'll be fine.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.920
Oh,hey,and I also had an
idea for what I'm going to do.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.910
I was thinking maybe,like,eurorail through
europe,uh,you know,backpacking,that kind of thing.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.390
- That sounds...
- awesome.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.930
Remind me to tell you
about amsterdam,my man.

37:13.390 --> 37:15.900
lovely city,lot of canals.

37:16.270 --> 37:18.120
It's a great idea,chuck;
good luck tonight.

37:18.260 --> 37:20.290
- Good luck,bud.
- Hey,you,too.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.130
And remember,buddy,pace yourself.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.120
It's a marathon.

39:16.770 --> 39:21.360
so,sarah,what do you,what do you think
of,um,what do you think of europe?

39:21.500 --> 39:25.660
You,me,a couple of... eurorail passes?

39:25.740 --> 39:27.890
Just seeing the world.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.430
Seeing,seeing the world.

39:30.790 --> 39:33.190
What the hell?Ask her...

39:40.200 --> 39:42.430
- hey,sarah.
- CHUCK

39:42.500 --> 39:43.610
What is it?

39:43.760 --> 39:47.040
We have to call off the
date.The intersect was destroyed.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.510
What?But the cipher...

39:50.620 --> 39:52.610
it was a trojan horse,a sabotage device.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.370
The moment it came online,it exploded.

39:59.690 --> 40:03.260
- But that means...
- you're still the only intersect.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.470
I'm sorry.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.710
- hello,charles.
- Chuck's fine.

40:26.870 --> 40:30.740
Actuno,ally,he isn'T.You see,as
the assistant manager and your boss,

40:30.860 --> 40:34.130
it's my duty to inform you that I have had
several complaints from customers about you.

40:34.180 --> 40:36.160
Oh,you have,have you?

40:36.530 --> 40:37.880
Not specifically.

40:37.980 --> 40:42.660
But I haven't had any compliments,and
in my book that's the same thing.

40:42.900 --> 40:45.630
Yeah?Good.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.840
How's it going,chuck?

40:49.980 --> 40:53.230
How's it going?That's
a,that's a great question.

40:53.330 --> 40:54.730
I'll tell you,buddy.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.150
I just had a vision,okay?

40:57.190 --> 41:00.190
A vision of the rest of
my life.And you know what?

41:00.360 --> 41:05.950
It takes place in the same outfit,behind
the same desk,in the same store.

41:07.950 --> 41:09.170
Got you.

41:09.310 --> 41:11.380
Talk to dr.Morgan.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.630
It's safe,go ahead.

41:14.140 --> 41:19.540
I just thought I'd be going somewhere,you
know,not just metaphysically or spiritually-but..

41:19.650 --> 41:23.500
- I want,you know,out of burbank to,to...
- glendale.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.930
all right,listen,look at me.

41:29.400 --> 41:34.230
In all honesty,and I hope you know this,I've always
been of the mind that you are destined for great things.

41:34.310 --> 41:40.540
Whatever you want to do,you can do-- all right,senator,president,emperor
of the known universe,whatever you want to do.

41:40.710 --> 41:42.030
You understand?

41:42.300 --> 41:43.110
Yeah.You're good.

41:43.230 --> 41:47.630
But before you go running off to change
the world,I think that I should tell you

41:47.670 --> 41:50.800
that I am currently on my
way to securing 45 twinkies.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.270
Now,by which I mean 45 bags of twinkies.

41:54.370 --> 41:56.410
Why would you do that?Good question.

41:56.510 --> 41:59.100
Because jeff said he'd eat all
of them in under three minutes.

41:59.190 --> 42:03.540
Now,he thinks he's eating 45,but
technically speaking,he agreed to eat 90.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.390
- 90?
- Yeah.

42:05.530 --> 42:08.060
- Nobody can eat 90 twinkies.
- That's what I said,dude.

42:08.200 --> 42:12.920
He may die o-or at least do extreme
damage to several major organs.

42:14.130 --> 42:16.500
This I have to see.

42:17.190 --> 42:18.230
Good to see you,bartowski.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.810
Hey,casey,90 twinkies in
three minutes.Be there.

42:20.950 --> 42:23.290
- Jeff might die.
- No way!
