03:12.208 --> 03:14.051
Hey, Jacobi!

03:14.709 --> 03:16.387
Fatso.

03:18.547 --> 03:20.382
Hold it down, will you?

03:20.383 --> 03:22.434
People are trying to work up here.

03:31.476 --> 03:33.696
Screw you!

03:44.073 --> 03:45.573
No respect for the press.

03:45.574 --> 03:46.700
You in or out?

03:46.701 --> 03:48.252
I'm in.
I'm in.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.204
Ante up.

03:52.205 --> 03:53.248
All right.

03:53.249 --> 03:56.208
Why the hell don't we chip
in and get some new cards?

03:56.209 --> 03:58.837
Don't look at me, I haven't won
a hand since Leopold and Lobe.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.130
Jack bets.

04:00.131 --> 04:01.890
A nickel.
Call.

04:04.801 --> 04:07.679
Possible straight.
Possible flush.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.097
Jack-eight, pair of sevens.

04:10.098 --> 04:11.266
Possible shit.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.444
Pair of sevens bet a nickel.

04:14.312 --> 04:16.313
A nickel, a schtickel.
I raise you a dime.

04:16.314 --> 04:18.939
Gaylord Schwartz, Riverboat
gambler, I raise you a dime.

04:18.940 --> 04:21.151
It's a quarter to me, right?

04:21.152 --> 04:22.152
I'll stick.

04:22.153 --> 04:23.746
I'll call.

04:24.155 --> 04:25.905
Why doesn't somebody
answer the phone?

04:25.906 --> 04:27.957
It's the Examiner phone.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.745
Flush.

04:31.746 --> 04:33.455
Criminal Courts, pressroom.

04:33.456 --> 04:35.247
No, Hildy Johnson isn't here.

04:35.248 --> 04:36.333
Queen.

04:36.334 --> 04:37.958
Oh, hello, Mr. Burns.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.220
No, Hildy hasn't come in yet.

04:40.588 --> 04:44.183
Sure thing, Mr. Burns, I'll tell
him the minute he shows up.

04:44.925 --> 04:47.895
That's the third time
Walter Burns has called.

04:48.638 --> 04:50.180
Where do you suppose Hildy is?

04:50.181 --> 04:52.307
Probably had a big night
at Madame Chow's.

04:52.308 --> 04:54.809
I hear she's got some new
broads in from San Francisco.

04:54.810 --> 04:57.646
I could go for a little of that
sweet and sour pork right now.

04:57.647 --> 04:59.064
Come on, cut the gab.
Jacks bet.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.449
I check to the Chinese gourmet.

05:02.485 --> 05:03.692
Two bits.

05:03.693 --> 05:04.778
Call me a sucker.

05:04.779 --> 05:05.820
El foldo.

05:05.821 --> 05:08.155
This place smells
like the city dump.

05:08.156 --> 05:10.542
How can you breathe in here?

05:14.454 --> 05:16.288
Hey, Bensinger, any
news on the hanging?

05:16.289 --> 05:17.791
Did you talk to the Sheriff?

05:17.792 --> 05:20.468
Why don't you guys get
your own stories?

05:21.837 --> 05:24.171
Who's been using my towel?

05:24.172 --> 05:25.674
And where is my toilet paper?

05:25.675 --> 05:27.174
How many times have I told you...

05:27.175 --> 05:28.768
Temper.
Temper.

05:29.010 --> 05:31.846
For Christ's sake, why don't you
bring your own toilet paper?

05:31.847 --> 05:33.431
Or use those rags you work for?

05:33.432 --> 05:35.684
Two pair, jacks high.

05:35.685 --> 05:37.727
Read them and weep, three treys.

05:37.728 --> 05:38.812
Beats me.

05:38.813 --> 05:40.397
Here you are, Bensinger.

05:40.398 --> 05:41.690
Hey, blushing pink.

05:41.691 --> 05:42.732
Whoa, whoa.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.191
I only used four sheets.

05:44.192 --> 05:45.828
You better count 'em.

05:48.155 --> 05:50.291
Bunch of goddamn gypsies.

05:53.326 --> 05:55.619
This is Bensinger,
give me a rewrite man.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.372
Take your time.
Take your time.

05:57.373 --> 05:59.082
Oh, Marty, is that you?

05:59.083 --> 06:01.459
"New lead on the Earl
Williams hanging."

06:01.460 --> 06:04.754
Yes, the execution is still
set for 7:00 in the morning.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.131
"The authorities are prepared

06:06.132 --> 06:08.851
for a general uprising of
radicals at that time."

06:09.552 --> 06:10.926
Murphy here.
Get me rewrite.

06:10.927 --> 06:13.179
"Extra guards have just been
thrown around the jail,

06:13.180 --> 06:14.346
"the municipal building,

06:14.347 --> 06:16.891
railroad terminals,
elevated stations."

06:16.892 --> 06:19.101
Update on the Williams hanging.

06:19.102 --> 06:21.730
Sheriff Hartman's just put 200
more relatives on the payroll

06:21.731 --> 06:23.647
to protect the city
against the Red Army,

06:23.648 --> 06:25.816
which is leaving Moscow
in a couple of minutes.

06:25.817 --> 06:27.193
Bet a dime.

06:27.194 --> 06:30.697
Now, this is what the condemned
man ordered for his final meal:

06:30.698 --> 06:32.991
Shrimp cocktail with
Thousand Island dressing,

06:32.992 --> 06:34.743
rare roast beef, Brussels sprouts,

06:34.744 --> 06:36.411
apple pie a la mode, Ovaltine.

06:36.412 --> 06:38.120
"For his last meal
Williams is getting

06:38.121 --> 06:41.625
a 95-cent blue plate special from the
greasy spoon across the street."

06:41.626 --> 06:45.754
"At 9:00 tonight, Williams will be
examined by still another psychologist

06:45.755 --> 06:47.422
"Dr. Max J.
Eggelhofer,

06:47.423 --> 06:50.893
at the request of the Friends
of American Liberty."

06:51.093 --> 06:53.720
Eggelhofer.
Yes, he's from Vienna.

06:53.721 --> 06:55.846
It's in my story this morning.

06:55.847 --> 06:59.309
He wrote that book Self Abuse
and Antisocial Behavior.

06:59.310 --> 07:01.102
Poor bastard's gonna
swing in the morning

07:01.103 --> 07:04.189
and this brain wants to ask if he
played with himself when he was five.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.315
Pair of bullets.

07:05.316 --> 07:06.533
More later.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.442
Half a buck.

07:08.443 --> 07:10.444
Wait a minute.
Don't I get a card?

07:10.445 --> 07:11.789
Call.

07:12.782 --> 07:14.156
Pressroom.

07:14.157 --> 07:16.660
No, Mr. Burns, Hildy
hasn't shown yet.

07:16.661 --> 07:18.212
No, we haven't heard a word...

07:20.623 --> 07:23.959
That dumb son-of-a-bitch bastard!

07:23.960 --> 07:25.928
Who does he think he is?

07:26.878 --> 07:29.889
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

07:30.341 --> 07:33.969
Well, look, if Hildy shows
up, will you be kind enough

07:33.970 --> 07:38.139
to tell that dumb son-of-a-bitch
bastard to get his ass over here?

07:38.140 --> 07:39.607
Thank you.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.404
Any luck?

07:43.813 --> 07:46.605
I've tried every speakeasy,
every gamblin' joint.

07:46.606 --> 07:48.942
I've tried the Turkish bath.
No Hildy.

07:48.943 --> 07:50.360
Call the Sanitation Department,

07:50.361 --> 07:52.486
maybe they've picked
him up in some gutter.

07:52.487 --> 07:55.282
I guess I better check the
hospitals or the morgue.

07:55.283 --> 07:59.160
Be just like that clown to die
on me on the eve of a hanging.

07:59.161 --> 08:01.212
How about those headlines?

08:06.042 --> 08:08.304
Which one do you like?

08:10.338 --> 08:12.016
They all stink.

08:13.467 --> 08:17.146
Trouble is, there's not much
you can do with a hanging.

08:17.512 --> 08:20.222
Now, if we had the electric
chair in this state,

08:20.223 --> 08:23.611
that's something you can
really sink your teeth into.

08:24.312 --> 08:26.946
"Williams gets the hot seat!"

08:27.023 --> 08:29.316
"Williams Fries."

08:29.317 --> 08:32.077
"Williams Roasted Alive."

08:34.864 --> 08:37.114
 Step right up Shake my hand

08:37.115 --> 08:39.159
 My baby told me that she loves me

08:39.159 --> 08:40.826
Mr. Johnson, I'm so glad.

08:40.827 --> 08:43.756
Mr. Burns has been looking
for you all over.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.169
 Congratulate me, step right up

08:49.170 --> 08:50.377
 Shake my hand

08:50.378 --> 08:51.805
Hi, Hildy.

08:52.672 --> 08:55.141
Is it a holiday or something?

08:59.262 --> 09:02.057
Hey, look at him.
Prince of Wales.

09:02.058 --> 09:04.485
 Congratulate me I'm in love

09:04.602 --> 09:06.311
Where the hell have you been?

09:06.312 --> 09:08.063
Well, let's see.
I had a haircut,

09:08.064 --> 09:10.065
I got a manicure,
I did a little shoppin'.

09:10.066 --> 09:11.825
Hi, Duffy.
Yeah.

09:12.068 --> 09:13.735
What the hell are
you dressed up for?

09:13.736 --> 09:16.363
You're not covering a polo match,
you're covering a hanging.

09:16.364 --> 09:18.239
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.492
Tomorrow you and I are gonna
stand this town on its ear.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.493
Oh, yeah.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.412
Every damn paper is gonna have the
same damn story on that execution.

09:24.413 --> 09:25.956
But we're going to scoop them all.

09:25.957 --> 09:27.581
Because you know
what goes in there?

09:27.582 --> 09:30.085
A picture of Williams
swinging by the neck.

09:30.086 --> 09:32.420
A picture? A photograph,
the first time anywhere.

09:32.421 --> 09:33.712
Exclusive in the Examiner.

09:33.713 --> 09:34.880
What are you talkin' about?

09:34.881 --> 09:37.258
That's against the law.
You can't bring a camera in there.

09:37.259 --> 09:39.018
Who's gonna know?

09:39.761 --> 09:42.565
Here, I had this
specially rigged up.

09:43.181 --> 09:47.152
You clip it to your ankle,
you run the tube up your pants leg.

09:47.270 --> 09:48.853
Make a hole in your pocket.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.231
The minute Williams drops
through that trap door

09:51.232 --> 09:54.316
you lift your pants leg and
squeeze the bulb. Clever?

09:54.317 --> 09:55.860
You sure come up with some doozies.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.320
At 7:00, the guy kicks off,

09:58.321 --> 10:00.489
at 7:03 you're out
of the jail yard,

10:00.490 --> 10:02.117
there's an ambulance
waiting for you

10:02.118 --> 10:03.952
with a darkroom and a
typewriter inside.

10:03.953 --> 10:05.662
You take off with the sirens going.

10:05.663 --> 10:07.455
While you're batting out the story,

10:07.456 --> 10:08.914
they're developing the negative.

10:08.915 --> 10:11.418
At 7:22, the picture
gets to the engraver,

10:11.419 --> 10:12.961
and we start setting up your copy.

10:12.962 --> 10:15.422
At 7:56, we re-plate
the front page.

10:15.423 --> 10:17.214
At 8:12, the presses start rolling

10:17.215 --> 10:21.061
and at 8:47, you're out in the
street with an extra. How's that?

10:21.803 --> 10:24.805
Walter, you'll either get the Pulitzer
Prize or a year in the clink.

10:24.806 --> 10:26.683
You and me both, we're
in this together.

10:26.684 --> 10:28.685
Now, what I want is
about 1,200 words.

10:28.686 --> 10:29.978
You know, lots of atmosphere.

10:29.979 --> 10:31.228
With the cold, gray dawn,

10:31.229 --> 10:34.024
and a voice from the death house
singing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,

10:34.025 --> 10:37.818
and the body twisting
slowly, slowly in the wind.

10:37.819 --> 10:39.696
I don't have to tell you.
Anything else?

10:39.697 --> 10:41.822
Yeah. We'll need some
last words from Williams

10:41.823 --> 10:44.658
as he walks up those 13 steps.
Something with a punch to it.

10:44.659 --> 10:46.161
If necessary make 'em up yourself.

10:46.162 --> 10:47.828
Last words? You want
some last words?

10:47.829 --> 10:49.623
I'll give you some
last words. I quit.

10:49.624 --> 10:51.248
A guy about to be hung? No.

10:51.249 --> 10:52.334
He wouldn't say that.

10:52.335 --> 10:54.628
Not Williams, me. I quit.
What?

10:54.629 --> 10:56.338
I'm resigning.
Effective immediately.

10:56.339 --> 10:57.838
It's the Tribune, right?

10:57.839 --> 10:59.799
They've been trying to
steal you for years.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.550
I won't work for the Tribune...

11:01.551 --> 11:03.677
Damn right.
Nobody walks out on Walter Burns.

11:03.678 --> 11:06.473
Or any newspaper.
Walter, I'm getting married.

11:06.474 --> 11:09.683
Getting married? What the hell for?
You've already been married.

11:09.684 --> 11:11.937
Some marriage that was.
I never even got to Niagara Falls

11:11.938 --> 11:14.773
'cause you made me get off the
train to cover the torch murder.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.733
That's what makes you a
first-class reporter.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.818
You're always in the right
place at the right time.

11:18.819 --> 11:22.279
But never at home, Walter. Not for
Christmas, not for our anniversary.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.366
When she was sick in the
hospital and nearly died,

11:24.367 --> 11:27.077
I was stuck in Tennessee covering
that goddamn Monkey Trial.

11:27.078 --> 11:29.578
It's not gonna happen again,
Walter. Not this time.

11:29.579 --> 11:31.206
Okay, Hildy.
You want to take

11:31.207 --> 11:32.873
the plunge again, all right.

11:32.874 --> 11:33.959
Tell you what we do.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.293
First you cover the hanging,
then you can get married.

11:36.294 --> 11:37.629
Take the whole weekend off.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.674
Don't come into the office till Monday.
Monday I'll be in Philadelphia.

11:40.675 --> 11:42.716
Philadelphia?
We're taking the midnight train,

11:42.717 --> 11:44.135
tomorrow afternoon we get married

11:44.136 --> 11:46.178
with her family and
everything and everybody.

11:46.179 --> 11:49.266
Monday I start working for her
uncle in the advertising business.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.474
The advertising business?

11:50.475 --> 11:52.893
You heard me. I'm goin' straight.
I'm quittin' this racket.

11:52.894 --> 11:55.187
You mean you're going to
be writing crap like,

11:55.188 --> 11:58.525
"I'd walk a mile for a Camel"
or "Quick, Henry, the Flit"?

11:58.526 --> 12:01.236
You bet.
For $150 a week.

12:01.237 --> 12:03.697
Jesus, Hildy.
You're a newspaperman,

12:03.698 --> 12:05.865
not some faggot writing poetry

12:05.866 --> 12:07.951
about brassieres and laxatives.

12:07.952 --> 12:11.162
It's all set. We got 300 extra
newsboys for tomorrow morning.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.748
St. Paul's Parochial School
is gonna be playin' hooky.

12:13.749 --> 12:16.333
We'll cover Chicago
like a blizzard.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.971
Goodbye, Duffy.
Watch the diabetes.

12:19.045 --> 12:21.849
Walter, it's been fun.

12:21.882 --> 12:23.008
What does he mean by that?

12:23.009 --> 12:24.467
He's leavin' us.
Gettin' married.

12:24.468 --> 12:25.468
Yeah?

12:25.469 --> 12:27.137
That hostess at the
Hotsy Totsy Club?

12:27.138 --> 12:28.430
You're not even close.

12:28.431 --> 12:29.638
This is a very classy dame.

12:29.639 --> 12:31.891
Philadelphia.
Studied to be a concert pianist.

12:31.892 --> 12:35.437
Where the hell would you
meet a concert pianist?

12:35.438 --> 12:37.397
Well, actually, she's a widow.

12:37.398 --> 12:39.316
Husband cracked up in
a brand-new Packard.

12:39.317 --> 12:41.776
Only had 18 miles on it.
So, to support herself

12:41.777 --> 12:44.738
she's playing the organ at
the Balaban & Katz Theatre.

12:44.739 --> 12:45.821
The one in the Loop?

12:45.822 --> 12:47.782
Yeah.
We've been dating three months.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.492
Jeez, why didn't you tell me?

12:49.493 --> 12:51.578
I would've thrown you
a little farewell party.

12:51.579 --> 12:53.455
Oh, no, no.
I know your farewell parties.

12:53.456 --> 12:55.290
When Ben Hecht was
leaving for Hollywood,

12:55.291 --> 12:56.957
you slipped a Mickey
in his gin fizz.

12:56.958 --> 12:59.210
It took four of us to get him
on the California Limited.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.088
Well, look at him now. Sitting
under those goddamn palm trees,

13:02.089 --> 13:04.892
writing dialogue for Rin Tin Tin.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.719
What's the matter with you guys?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.638
You're traitors, all of you.

13:09.639 --> 13:12.599
If it isn't Hollywood,
it's Broadway or Paris.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.309
Write the great American novel.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.736
Be Scott Fitzgerald.
Christ!

13:16.853 --> 13:18.605
And now, you're gonna sell out.

13:18.606 --> 13:21.524
The last real newspaperman
I got on this sheet.

13:21.525 --> 13:23.902
Don't give me that Vaseline, Jocko.

13:23.903 --> 13:26.780
When you did that interview with
Earl Williams in the death house,

13:26.781 --> 13:29.407
our circulation went up 75,000.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.575
It's been your story right
from the beginning.

13:31.576 --> 13:32.701
You can't run out now.

13:32.702 --> 13:33.787
Can't I?
Watch me.

13:33.788 --> 13:35.497
Because, hot or cold,
rain or shine,

13:35.498 --> 13:37.832
I'm gonna be on the midnight
train to Philadelphia.

13:37.833 --> 13:40.126
Okay, you ungrateful
son of a bitch.

13:40.127 --> 13:41.877
I picked you up when
you were a nothing,

13:41.878 --> 13:43.964
covering Polack weddings
on the South side.

13:43.965 --> 13:45.340
I taught you everything I knew.

13:45.341 --> 13:48.051
And now when I need you,
you stab me in the back.

13:48.052 --> 13:50.387
Well, I can take the
greenest cub out there

13:50.388 --> 13:53.348
and turn him into a better
reporter than you ever were.

13:53.349 --> 13:55.234
Fix him another Bromo.

13:55.559 --> 13:59.320
Get out of here, you lousy,
double-crossing heel.

14:00.690 --> 14:03.409
Well, as long as there's
no hard feelings.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.450
You really gonna let him go?

14:12.451 --> 14:14.128
In a pig's eye.

14:14.829 --> 14:17.080
Marrying some dame
that plays the organ

14:17.081 --> 14:20.091
from Philadelphia,
for Christ's sake.

14:33.389 --> 14:36.098
 Button up your overcoat

14:36.099 --> 14:38.560
 When the wind is free

14:38.561 --> 14:40.854
 Take good care of yourself

14:40.855 --> 14:43.365
 You belong to me

14:44.232 --> 14:46.776
 Eat an apple every day

14:46.777 --> 14:49.236
 Get to bed by 03:00

14:49.237 --> 14:51.489
 Take good care of yourself

14:51.490 --> 14:53.617
 You belong to me!

14:53.618 --> 14:55.910
 Be careful crossing streets

14:55.911 --> 14:58.580
 Ooh, ooh, don't eat meats

14:58.581 --> 15:01.248
 Ooh, ooh, cut out sweets

15:01.249 --> 15:05.587
 Ooh, ooh, you'll get a
pain and ruin your tum-tum

15:05.588 --> 15:08.130
 Keep away from bootleg hootch

15:08.131 --> 15:10.592
 when you're on a spree

15:10.593 --> 15:12.719
 Take good care of yourself

15:12.720 --> 15:17.191
 You belong to me!

15:37.577 --> 15:39.913
On his return from the South Pole,

15:39.914 --> 15:41.206
Cdr. Richard E.
Byrd

15:41.207 --> 15:44.051
gets a tumultuous welcome
in New York Harbor.

15:54.469 --> 15:57.471
Party boss Joseph Stalin
reviews Russia's military might

15:57.472 --> 16:00.483
marching past Lenin's
tomb in Red Square.

16:31.382 --> 16:32.465
Miss Grant?

16:32.466 --> 16:33.808
Yes?

16:34.844 --> 16:36.051
Can I have a word with you?

16:36.052 --> 16:38.138
My name is Fishbein, Otto Fishbein.

16:38.139 --> 16:40.140
Oh, if you're a booking
agent, don't bother.

16:40.141 --> 16:41.683
I am getting out of show business.

16:41.684 --> 16:43.143
Well, nothing like that.

16:43.144 --> 16:45.111
I'm a probation officer.

16:45.645 --> 16:47.323
Probation officer?

16:48.106 --> 16:49.608
What's this all about?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.026
Well, it's come to our attention

16:51.027 --> 16:53.360
that you're planning to marry
one Hildebrand Johnson

16:53.361 --> 16:55.322
also known as Hildy Johnson.

16:55.323 --> 16:56.530
So?

16:56.531 --> 16:58.325
Well, that's okay.
But we understand

16:58.326 --> 17:00.201
you're planning to
move to Philadelphia.

17:00.202 --> 17:01.745
Is there anything wrong with that?

17:01.746 --> 17:03.455
Plenty. He can't leave Chicago.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.040
He has to report to us every week.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
Why?

17:06.041 --> 17:07.415
Because he's on probation.

17:07.416 --> 17:08.801
For what?

17:08.877 --> 17:10.669
You mean he didn't tell you?

17:10.670 --> 17:12.172
Well, I can hardly blame him.

17:12.173 --> 17:13.632
What are you talking about?

17:13.633 --> 17:14.758
Now don't get panicky.

17:14.759 --> 17:16.967
He's not really a
criminal, he's just sick.

17:16.968 --> 17:17.968
Sick?

17:17.969 --> 17:19.054
Well, not all the time.

17:19.055 --> 17:21.856
But every so often he
gets this crazy urge.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.601
Mr. Fishbein, I'm not
a naive young thing.

17:24.602 --> 17:26.394
I've been married before.

17:26.395 --> 17:28.781
Now, just what did Hildy do?

17:28.855 --> 17:30.981
As long as he was doing
it in dark alleys

17:30.982 --> 17:32.943
and deserted parks, well,

17:32.944 --> 17:34.985
we in the department
have some compassion.

17:34.986 --> 17:37.614
But this last time, it
happened in broad daylight

17:37.615 --> 17:39.532
in the Chicago Art Institute.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.493
For God's sake, what happened?

17:41.494 --> 17:45.454
Well, there were those 16
high-school girls on a tour

17:45.455 --> 17:47.748
and there he was at the
top of the staircase

17:47.749 --> 17:50.000
wearing a raincoat, and
it wasn't even raining.

17:50.001 --> 17:51.585
Is that some sort of a crime?

17:51.586 --> 17:53.879
You know what he was wearing
underneath? Shoes and socks.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.131
And?
That's it.

17:55.132 --> 17:58.727
We get those exhibitionists all the time.
"Hey, lady, look!"

18:00.513 --> 18:02.439
I... I don't believe it.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.776
We got a file on him this thick.

18:08.271 --> 18:09.478
Poor Hildy.

18:09.479 --> 18:10.730
Poor Hildy.

18:10.731 --> 18:12.232
He'd be in jail right now,

18:12.233 --> 18:14.651
if it weren't for that editor
of his, that Walter something.

18:14.652 --> 18:15.819
Walter Burns?

18:15.820 --> 18:16.945
That's it.

18:16.946 --> 18:19.823
Pulled a lot of strings with the
state's attorney and the judge.

18:19.824 --> 18:21.916
That's what I call a real friend.

18:23.828 --> 18:25.503
That'll be Hildy.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.331
What can I say to him?

18:29.332 --> 18:30.417
Save your breath.

18:30.418 --> 18:31.960
He'll just deny everything, anyway.

18:31.961 --> 18:35.130
If I were you, I'd go back to
Philadelphia and forget all about him.

18:35.131 --> 18:37.390
And not even say goodbye?

18:39.885 --> 18:40.885
Hello?

18:40.886 --> 18:41.970
Hi, baby.

18:41.971 --> 18:44.805
This is your dream lover,
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

18:44.806 --> 18:46.016
I just thought I'd check in.

18:46.017 --> 18:47.942
Boy, have I had a busy afternoon.

18:49.437 --> 18:52.364
Where were you?
At the Art Museum?

18:52.939 --> 18:54.316
Art Museum?
What Art Museum?

18:54.317 --> 18:55.357
I went to the office

18:55.358 --> 18:57.703
and told Walter Burns he
could take his job and...

18:58.487 --> 19:00.488
Then I picked up the rings,
the train tickets,

19:00.489 --> 19:01.990
and I've almost finished packin'.

19:01.991 --> 19:04.159
Did you remember to
pack your raincoat?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.410
Well, who packs a raincoat?

19:05.411 --> 19:07.661
I'm gonna carry it over my arm,
just in case.

19:07.662 --> 19:09.173
Just in case?

19:09.372 --> 19:12.000
Oh, Hildy, You don't need a wife,
you need a doctor.

19:12.001 --> 19:13.834
Look, I feel very sorry for you,

19:13.835 --> 19:16.504
but I just couldn't live with
that kind of a problem.

19:16.505 --> 19:18.599
That's tellin' him.
Now, just hang up.

19:18.673 --> 19:20.549
Uh, honey, w-w-what's the matter?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.811
I... I don't understand you.
What have I done?

19:23.930 --> 19:26.439
Your probation officer
is right here with me.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.652
Probation officer?
I don't know any probation...

19:29.769 --> 19:31.403
He said what?

19:32.270 --> 19:36.024
Me? Oh, now wait a
minute, honey. Well...

19:36.025 --> 19:37.817
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait.

19:37.818 --> 19:39.361
What does this guy look like?

19:39.362 --> 19:41.029
Never mind.
I'll describe him to you.

19:41.030 --> 19:43.740
About 6'3", huge feet,
mean little eyes,

19:43.741 --> 19:45.157
and a nose like a pickle.
Right?

19:45.158 --> 19:47.127
You want to know who that is?

19:47.536 --> 19:49.703
Honey, you're not
gonna believe this.

19:49.704 --> 19:52.465
Walter Burns,
that conniving son of a...

19:53.668 --> 19:55.502
Well, I better be
running along now.

19:55.503 --> 19:57.504
I have a couple of other
cases to look into.

19:57.505 --> 19:58.587
Uh, just a minute.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.048
Hildy would like to speak to you.

20:00.049 --> 20:03.051
Not now.
I have to check up on the candy man.

20:03.052 --> 20:06.388
We call him that because he
hangs around schoolyards.

20:06.389 --> 20:07.648
Here.

20:11.768 --> 20:13.529
Hello.
Fishbein speaking.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.981
Fishbein, huh?
Listen, you lousy baboon.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.816
You better start wearing
cast-iron shorts

20:17.817 --> 20:19.234
because the next time I see you,

20:19.235 --> 20:20.944
I'm gonna bury my shoe up your ass.

20:20.945 --> 20:23.071
Come on, Hildy.
You used to be able to take a joke

20:23.072 --> 20:25.331
before you went into the
advertising business.

20:25.408 --> 20:27.409
Of all of the lowdown, stinking...

20:27.410 --> 20:29.244
You'd wreck my marriage
just to keep me

20:29.245 --> 20:30.786
on that crummy paper of yours?

20:30.787 --> 20:34.915
Hildy, all I'm asking is that
you postpone it for 24 hours.

20:34.916 --> 20:36.719
Just cover this hanging for me.

20:36.918 --> 20:40.212
Mr. Burns, I wouldn't cover
the last supper for you

20:40.213 --> 20:42.424
if they held it in the pump
room of the Ambassador East.

20:42.425 --> 20:45.135
Now, you get the hell off the
phone and let me speak to my girl.

20:45.136 --> 20:48.272
All right. All right.
The flasher wants to talk to you.

20:49.265 --> 20:51.266
That was a rotten thing to do.

20:51.267 --> 20:52.892
It was for your own good,
believe me.

20:52.893 --> 20:55.020
Marry an undertaker,
marry a blackjack dealer,

20:55.021 --> 20:58.105
marry a pickpocket,
but never marry a newspaperman.

20:58.106 --> 20:59.608
That's why I'm making him quit.

20:59.609 --> 21:01.568
You can't make a
leopard change its spots,

21:01.569 --> 21:03.278
or hitch a fire horse
to a milk wagon.

21:03.279 --> 21:04.779
He'll be like a fish out of water.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.822
We'll take our chances.
Now, if you don't mind.

21:06.823 --> 21:09.701
Just a friendly warning.
That's my wedding present to you.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.745
Darling, I'm sorry.
I should've known better,

21:11.746 --> 21:13.622
but he just sounded so convincing.

21:13.623 --> 21:16.123
I finish my last show at 9:15.
Will you pick me up?

21:16.124 --> 21:18.710
Tell Hildy I wish him all the
luck in the world and I mean it

21:18.711 --> 21:21.221
or my name isn't Otto Fishbein.

21:21.671 --> 21:22.589
A dime.

21:22.590 --> 21:23.632
Make it two bits.

21:23.633 --> 21:24.758
I'm shy a quarter.

21:24.759 --> 21:26.227
Too rich for me.

21:27.762 --> 21:29.220
Can I clean up in here?

21:29.221 --> 21:30.221
Yes.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.689
No!

21:32.390 --> 21:34.026
Queen.

21:34.392 --> 21:35.735
Ace.

21:37.521 --> 21:39.563
Hey, listen.
I'm the big loser here.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.107
Somebody must be winning.

21:41.108 --> 21:42.618
Crack it for a dime.

21:42.652 --> 21:44.036
By me.

21:44.152 --> 21:45.779
I'm in.

21:45.780 --> 21:47.571
A deuce, I can't read it.

21:47.572 --> 21:48.657
Pair of fours.

21:48.658 --> 21:50.325
Pair of kings, bets a quarter.

21:50.326 --> 21:51.534
Oh, I'm out.

21:51.535 --> 21:52.744
Good evening.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.912
That's your light.

21:53.913 --> 21:54.995
Give me a card.

21:54.996 --> 21:56.039
Excuse me, gentlemen.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.300
Sorry to interrupt,
but which is the Examiner desk?

21:59.502 --> 22:00.543
The what?

22:00.544 --> 22:02.002
This is the pressroom, isn't it?

22:02.003 --> 22:03.430
So?

22:03.506 --> 22:05.849
I'm Rudy Keppler.

22:06.259 --> 22:08.677
I'm here to cover the
execution for the Examiner.

22:08.678 --> 22:10.345
The Examiner?
How come?

22:10.346 --> 22:11.470
What happened to Hildy?

22:11.471 --> 22:13.305
Mr. Johnson is no
longer with the paper.

22:13.306 --> 22:14.516
What do you mean?

22:14.517 --> 22:17.485
He resigned.
Is this my place?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.020
Resigned?

22:20.021 --> 22:21.106
You're joking.

22:21.107 --> 22:24.024
From what I heard, he's getting
married and moving to Philadelphia.

22:24.025 --> 22:25.235
Come on, not Hildy.

22:25.236 --> 22:27.112
I thought he was
married to Walter Burns.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.487
He'll never give him a divorce.

22:28.488 --> 22:30.532
This place won't be the
same without Hildy.

22:30.533 --> 22:31.907
Well, I would hope so.

22:31.908 --> 22:35.035
I've always found him rowdy,
ill-mannered, and irresponsible.

22:35.036 --> 22:36.371
But a hell of a reporter.

22:36.372 --> 22:38.007
No contest.

22:38.498 --> 22:40.417
That's why I'm so nervous.

22:40.418 --> 22:42.377
Following in his footsteps.

22:42.378 --> 22:44.795
Being here with all
of you old pros.

22:44.796 --> 22:46.673
Hey, I'll bet you went to college.

22:46.674 --> 22:48.258
School of Journalism?

22:48.259 --> 22:49.384
How'd you guess?

22:49.385 --> 22:51.720
University of Wisconsin,
Class of '27.

22:51.721 --> 22:53.138
Oh, that was a good year.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.390
We could sure use some
new blood around here.

22:55.391 --> 22:56.766
That's for sure.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.058
Hey, you play poker?

22:58.059 --> 22:59.269
Cribbage is my game.

22:59.270 --> 23:00.770
And a little auction bridge.

23:00.771 --> 23:02.229
Don't worry.
We'll break you in.

23:02.230 --> 23:05.075
That's very kind of you.
But right now,

23:05.525 --> 23:07.193
is there any paper around here?

23:07.194 --> 23:10.121
Hey, Bensinger, why don't you
give him some of that pink stuff?

23:12.283 --> 23:15.753
I think you're all being perfectly
beastly to this nice young man.

23:20.373 --> 23:22.760
I've been lookin' for you bums.

23:23.126 --> 23:24.919
Hello, sweetheart.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.005
Well, if it isn't
Miss Mollie Malloy.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.130
Nooky-nooky.

23:28.131 --> 23:29.516
How's the old tomato can?

23:30.258 --> 23:32.551
Go on, laugh, damn you.

23:32.552 --> 23:35.013
Hey, Mollie, those were pretty
roses you sent Earl Williams.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.098
What do you want done with
them when he checks out?

23:37.099 --> 23:38.557
He left a 7:00 a.m. Call.

23:38.558 --> 23:40.559
Bunch of wisenheimers, ain't you?

23:40.560 --> 23:42.103
Well, you know what I think of you.

23:42.104 --> 23:43.939
You gonna pay a call
on your boyfriend?

23:43.940 --> 23:45.732
He's right across the
courtyard, Mollie.

23:45.733 --> 23:47.776
I'm sure he'd rather spend
his last night with you

23:47.777 --> 23:49.110
than with the chaplain.

23:49.111 --> 23:51.196
If you was worth breaking
my fingernails on,

23:51.197 --> 23:53.323
I'd tear your puss wide open.

23:53.324 --> 23:55.784
Would someone mind
introducing me to the lady?

23:55.785 --> 23:59.329
Lady? Huh. Just get a whiff of
that perfume, Fleur de Floozy.

23:59.330 --> 24:00.830
Bastards.
All of you.

24:00.831 --> 24:02.123
What are you sore about, huh?

24:02.124 --> 24:03.959
Wasn't that a swell
write-up we gave you?

24:03.960 --> 24:06.044
I never said I loved Earl Williams

24:06.045 --> 24:08.170
and was willing to marry
him on the gallows.

24:08.171 --> 24:09.256
You made that up.

24:09.257 --> 24:11.341
Come on, you've been
sucking around that cuckoo

24:11.342 --> 24:13.134
ever since he's been
in the death house.

24:13.135 --> 24:14.803
Everybody knows
you're his soul mate.

24:14.804 --> 24:16.137
That's a lot of bunk.

24:16.138 --> 24:18.098
Like all that other
stuff you been writin'.

24:18.099 --> 24:19.849
Calling me an Angel
of the Pavement,

24:19.850 --> 24:21.600
a Midnight Madonna.
Who're you kidding?

24:21.601 --> 24:24.437
I'm a $2 whore from Division
Street, and you know it.

24:24.438 --> 24:26.480
That's right.
She shouldn't be allowed in here.

24:26.481 --> 24:28.607
And that love nest you
had with Williams?

24:28.608 --> 24:31.069
That's a lie.
He never even laid a hand on me.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.697
You had that red in your bed
for three days and nights.

24:33.698 --> 24:34.990
Did he have that kind of money?

24:34.991 --> 24:36.950
Or did you make him
a special price?

24:36.951 --> 24:39.493
The poor guy didn't have
enough for a cup of coffee.

24:39.494 --> 24:41.203
He used to hang around
Division Street

24:41.204 --> 24:43.038
every night, handin' out leaflets.

24:43.039 --> 24:44.833
Tellin' us how we
were being exploited

24:44.834 --> 24:47.720
by capitalism and that
we should organize.

24:47.794 --> 24:50.005
So the pimps came
around and beat him up.

24:50.006 --> 24:52.674
And there he was,
lyin' on the sidewalk, bleedin'.

24:52.675 --> 24:54.685
With his glasses broken.

24:54.801 --> 24:58.095
So I took him up to my place,
like any human being would.

24:58.096 --> 25:00.097
That was a very
charitable thing to do.

25:00.098 --> 25:01.850
Yeah.
Meet Florence Nightingale.

25:01.851 --> 25:05.227
Sure, I took care of him.
And for three days and three nights

25:05.228 --> 25:06.896
he just talked to me.

25:06.897 --> 25:09.491
Treated me decent.
Not like an animal.

25:09.524 --> 25:12.485
Now, you guys are trying
to make a fool out of me.

25:12.486 --> 25:13.778
Why didn't you adopt him

25:13.779 --> 25:15.989
instead of letting him run
around shooting policemen?

25:15.990 --> 25:18.283
I told him to stay
away from that corner.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.367
When they sent a cop
to chase him away,

25:20.368 --> 25:23.120
he said it was his
constitutional right.

25:23.121 --> 25:26.091
So the cop pulled a gun
on him and he panicked.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.293
He just grabbed for the
gun and it went off.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.543
He didn't mean to kill him.

25:29.544 --> 25:31.171
Aw, put it on a Victrola record.

25:31.172 --> 25:33.298
Suppose that cop had
been your own brother?

25:33.299 --> 25:37.228
I wish to God it had been one
of you, you lousy punks.

25:39.221 --> 25:40.347
What's that?

25:40.348 --> 25:41.856
Just testing.

25:41.891 --> 25:43.140
Testing what?

25:43.141 --> 25:45.819
They're fixing up a pain in
the neck for your boyfriend.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.031
Maybe we ought to put a
little talcum on the noose,

25:58.032 --> 25:59.874
make it slide easier.

26:03.621 --> 26:05.506
Oh, my God!

26:06.916 --> 26:08.917
You gonna claim the body, Mollie?

26:08.918 --> 26:11.086
Or scatter his ashes
over Division Street?

26:11.087 --> 26:13.170
I suppose all the hookers
will go into mourning.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.349
Yeah, wear black underwear.

26:15.465 --> 26:18.352
Shame on you.
Shame.

26:18.593 --> 26:21.303
A poor little crazy fellow's
sitting there alone

26:21.304 --> 26:24.899
with the Angel of Death beside
him and you crackin' jokes.

26:24.976 --> 26:27.227
It's a wonder a bolt of
lightning don't come

26:27.228 --> 26:29.738
through the ceiling and
strike you all dead.

26:33.985 --> 26:36.444
That's enough of that.
Just go cry somewhere else.

26:36.445 --> 26:38.363
Yeah, Mollie,
get your keister out of here.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.447
This is the pressroom.

26:39.448 --> 26:40.614
I'm $4 behind.

26:40.615 --> 26:42.199
Come on, let's go.
Let go of me.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.368
Shut up!
Come on.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.462
Hey, lady, I'm on your side.

26:45.663 --> 26:46.705
You liars.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.788
Beat it, you tramp.

26:47.789 --> 26:49.300
You hoodlums.

26:50.835 --> 26:52.845
Gentlemen of the press?

26:56.631 --> 26:58.799
Hey, Mollie, what do you know?
What do you say?

26:58.800 --> 27:02.062
Oh, get lost. You're like
all the rest of them bums.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.862
 Is that a break now
Am I awake now?

27:10.438 --> 27:12.698
 or am I dreaming?

27:13.608 --> 27:17.068
Jennie, old girl, did anybody ever
tell you you've got a terrific behind?

27:17.069 --> 27:18.153
Not lately.

27:18.154 --> 27:19.988
Well, a thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

27:19.989 --> 27:22.324
Cut the blarney, Mr. Johnson.
What do you want now?

27:22.325 --> 27:24.909
I could use some ice,
some club soda,

27:24.910 --> 27:26.703
maybe a couple of
bottles of ginger ale.

27:26.704 --> 27:28.204
Coming up.
Right.

27:28.205 --> 27:30.539
King, seven, five, three, seven,

27:30.540 --> 27:32.500
nine, six, five,
and a 10. Bet the king.

27:32.501 --> 27:35.003
All right, you guys, on your
feet and reach for the ceiling.

27:35.004 --> 27:36.087
This joint's raided, see?

27:36.088 --> 27:37.129
Hey, Hildy.

27:37.130 --> 27:39.090
What's all this we hear?
Is it on the level?

27:39.091 --> 27:41.176
You really quitting?
Get a load of that outfit.

27:41.177 --> 27:43.135
What the well-dressed
bridegroom will wear.

27:43.136 --> 27:46.181
Nobody moves to Philadelphia for
Christ's sake! Say it isn't so, Hildy.

27:46.182 --> 27:47.264
It's all true, fellows.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.352
Two tickets to Philly,
and two wedding hoops. 18 carats.

27:50.353 --> 27:52.729
You're looking at
Hildebrand Johnson, Esq.,

27:52.730 --> 27:53.979
care of Waterbury and Adams,

27:53.980 --> 27:56.358
Advertising and Public
Relations, Philadelphia, PA.

27:56.359 --> 27:57.484
No shit.

27:57.485 --> 27:59.361
Nobody but fairies
goes into advertising.

27:59.362 --> 28:00.403
Sour grapes.

28:00.404 --> 28:01.987
How did Burns take the news?

28:01.988 --> 28:03.073
That conniving son...

28:03.074 --> 28:05.200
You know what he tried... Ah,
the hell with it.

28:05.201 --> 28:06.368
Get some paper cups.

28:06.369 --> 28:08.744
Hey, look at the hooch.
It's the real stuff.

28:08.745 --> 28:10.246
Just my farewell to the troops.

28:10.247 --> 28:12.374
Hildy, baby, when you go,
you go first class.

28:12.375 --> 28:15.543
It's worth it. I'll never have to
look at your ugly mugs again.

28:15.544 --> 28:17.504
Let's get rid of some of this crap.

28:17.505 --> 28:19.171
Yeah.
It's about time.

28:19.172 --> 28:20.632
Mr. Johnson?
Huh?

28:20.633 --> 28:22.174
You probably don't remember me,

28:22.175 --> 28:24.344
but we once met in the men's room.

28:24.345 --> 28:25.553
The men's room?
Where?

28:25.554 --> 28:26.720
At the Examiner.

28:26.721 --> 28:29.641
I'm Rudy Keppler, Mr. Duffy
sent me to take over for you.

28:29.642 --> 28:31.851
Is that so? And what were
you doing before this?

28:31.852 --> 28:33.894
Oh, a little bit of everything.
Social notes,

28:33.895 --> 28:35.896
book reviews,
covered a couple of fires.

28:35.897 --> 28:37.732
But this is my first hanging.

28:37.733 --> 28:39.191
Yeah.
It's okay, kid.

28:39.192 --> 28:41.786
It's Williams' first hanging, too.

28:43.239 --> 28:45.240
I snitched the ice from the morgue.

28:45.241 --> 28:46.907
Over here.

28:46.908 --> 28:48.617
What will you have, Jennie?

28:48.618 --> 28:50.327
Uh, maybe a little straight gin.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.997
Careful.
You're getting the cards wet.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.707
It's about time
somebody washed them.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.040
I could go for some ginger ale.

28:55.041 --> 28:56.835
Hey, slick, join us.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.210
Rock & Rye, please.

28:58.211 --> 29:00.014
Here you are, kid.

29:00.256 --> 29:03.090
Well, Hildy, here's to you.

29:03.091 --> 29:04.341
You lucky bastard.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.427
Godspeed, Hildy.

29:05.428 --> 29:07.730
And may the wind at your
back never be your own.

29:09.931 --> 29:12.026
All right.
Ahem.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.145
You sentimental slobs, before
everybody gets falling down drunk,

29:15.146 --> 29:16.605
I got a few markers here.

29:16.606 --> 29:17.938
McHugh, you owe me $5.

29:17.939 --> 29:19.106
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

29:19.107 --> 29:20.984
I won't be here.
I'll send it to you.

29:20.985 --> 29:22.485
I'll bet it gets lost in the mail.

29:22.486 --> 29:23.527
No bet.

29:23.528 --> 29:24.988
Schwartz, $6.
75. For what?

29:24.989 --> 29:27.114
For being a lousy poker player.
That's for what's.

29:27.115 --> 29:29.451
Hildy, about that $30.
You'll have to wait,

29:29.452 --> 29:31.952
it wasn't just my kid taking sick,
my old lady isn't...

29:31.953 --> 29:33.412
What $30?
Forget it.

29:33.413 --> 29:36.123
I might've known I couldn't collect
from you deadbeats, anyway.

29:36.124 --> 29:37.500
Big time Charlie, huh?

29:37.501 --> 29:38.710
How much they payin' you?

29:38.711 --> 29:40.086
Oh, you wouldn't want to know.

29:40.087 --> 29:41.630
It'd just make you green with envy.

29:41.631 --> 29:43.340
Are you gonna have
one of those offices

29:43.341 --> 29:45.674
with a rug on the floor, and
the stenographer on your lap?

29:45.675 --> 29:47.010
Oh, my wife won't go for that.

29:47.011 --> 29:48.762
Bet you get Saturdays
and Sundays off.

29:48.763 --> 29:50.013
And Christmas.

29:50.014 --> 29:52.641
You're gonna join the Country Club,
golf and Mah Jongg,

29:52.642 --> 29:55.310
silk pajamas with a monogram
right across your chest...

29:55.311 --> 29:58.104
Hold it. Now, look who's talking.
Journalists.

29:58.105 --> 30:00.190
Bunch of crazy buttinskies
with dandruff

30:00.191 --> 30:02.233
on their shoulders and
holes in their pants.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.236
Peeking through keyholes, waking
people up in the middle of the night

30:05.237 --> 30:08.415
to ask them what they think
about Aimee Semple McPherson.

30:08.573 --> 30:10.200
Stealing pictures off old ladies

30:10.201 --> 30:12.451
of their daughters that
get raped in Oak Park.

30:12.452 --> 30:14.412
And for what?
So a million shop girls

30:14.413 --> 30:17.040
and motormen's wives
can get their jollies.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.582
And the next day, somebody wraps

30:18.583 --> 30:20.669
the front page around
a dead mackerel.

30:20.670 --> 30:22.002
Don't knock it, Hildy.

30:22.003 --> 30:24.506
How long do you think
you'll last on that fancy job?

30:24.507 --> 30:27.133
Yeah, six months from now
you may be out on your ass.

30:27.134 --> 30:30.053
Never happen. You know why?
Because, my girl's uncle,

30:30.054 --> 30:33.223
he owns that advertising agency.
Now, tie that.

30:33.224 --> 30:34.432
What do you know?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.600
Our Hildy going into
the nephew business.

30:36.601 --> 30:37.560
A gigolo.

30:37.561 --> 30:39.521
Where's your pride, your integrity?

30:39.522 --> 30:41.772
What's the newspaper
business ever done for me?

30:41.773 --> 30:43.858
See, I don't want to end
up like you guys will,

30:43.859 --> 30:45.527
on a copy desk.

30:45.528 --> 30:47.404
Gray-haired, humpbacked,
half blind,

30:47.405 --> 30:49.914
bummin' cigarettes
from office boys.

30:51.908 --> 30:54.753
I think I'll have a
little more gin.

30:57.497 --> 30:59.874
Uh, what's the idea, fellas?

30:59.875 --> 31:02.377
You know better than that.
This is a government building.

31:02.378 --> 31:03.420
Ah, hi, Sheriff.

31:03.421 --> 31:04.546
What'll you have?

31:04.547 --> 31:07.132
I've got a good mind to
have you all locked up.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.758
The state's attorney
wouldn't like it

31:08.759 --> 31:11.102
because I bought that
stuff from his brother.

31:11.846 --> 31:14.306
If you gentlemen need more ice...

31:14.307 --> 31:16.016
Here are your tickets
for the hanging.

31:16.017 --> 31:18.861
Tribune. Journal of Commerce.

31:19.270 --> 31:20.312
Post.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.313
Only two?

31:21.314 --> 31:23.898
I promised a couple of the guys
in the Circulation Department.

31:23.899 --> 31:26.901
What do you think we're putting
on here, the World Series?

31:26.902 --> 31:29.997
Daily News.
Examiner.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.490
Here you are, Rudy.
The new man.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.618
Oh, what happened?
They finally fire you?

31:34.619 --> 31:38.038
I'm retiring to my country
estate outside Philadelphia.

31:38.039 --> 31:40.247
Well, in that case I
will have a drink.

31:40.248 --> 31:41.966
No, you won't.
Not my liquor.

31:42.793 --> 31:44.586
What should I do with
the second ticket?

31:44.587 --> 31:46.721
Sell it to a scalper
like the Sheriff does.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.423
I've had it with you, Johnson.

31:49.424 --> 31:50.884
When I think of all that malarkey

31:50.885 --> 31:52.761
you and Walter Burns
printed about me,

31:52.762 --> 31:56.097
full of hearsay, innuendo,
and character assassination...

31:56.098 --> 31:57.807
What do you mean?
Don't we always refer

31:57.808 --> 31:59.225
to you as "Honest" Pete Hartman?

31:59.226 --> 32:03.364
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And what about those
things you always put around "Honest"?

32:03.563 --> 32:04.688
Journal.

32:04.689 --> 32:07.025
Why can't you move the
hanging from 7:00 to 5:00

32:07.026 --> 32:08.692
so we can make the city edition?

32:08.693 --> 32:11.278
Oh, come on, Murph.
You can't hang a fella in his sleep

32:11.279 --> 32:12.738
just to please the newspapers.

32:12.739 --> 32:14.074
It ain't nice.
No.

32:14.075 --> 32:15.449
But you can reprieve him twice,

32:15.450 --> 32:18.285
so that the hanging comes
just before the election. Huh?

32:18.286 --> 32:20.664
With you and the Mayor running
on a law and order ticket.

32:20.665 --> 32:21.831
That is nice.

32:21.832 --> 32:24.376
I had nothin' to do with it.
That was the Governor.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.127
What if there's another reprieve?

32:26.128 --> 32:27.212
No chance.

32:27.213 --> 32:30.464
Suppose this Dr. Eggelhofer
finds out Williams is insane?

32:30.465 --> 32:33.175
Come on, boys,
you know that's just a formality

32:33.176 --> 32:35.553
to shut up those
pinko troublemakers.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.973
He's gonna examine him in
my office in a few minutes.

32:37.974 --> 32:41.685
But I can tell you right now,
Williams is as sane as I am.

32:41.686 --> 32:42.811
Saner.

32:42.812 --> 32:44.779
Oh, c-come on, fellas.

32:45.021 --> 32:48.984
He shot that cop as part of a
Bolshevik-anarchist conspiracy

32:48.985 --> 32:51.361
to subvert our
democratic institution.

32:51.362 --> 32:53.122
Baloney.

32:53.823 --> 32:55.573
Williams isn't a Red
and you know it.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.534
He's just a screwball
who had the lousy luck

32:57.535 --> 33:00.378
to shoot a colored cop
in an election year.

33:01.163 --> 33:03.497
Now I want you fellas
to tell it loud and clear

33:03.498 --> 33:05.499
that the death warrant
for Earl Williams

33:05.500 --> 33:08.712
is a death warrant for all the
radical elements in this town.

33:08.713 --> 33:09.795
Not again, Pete.

33:09.796 --> 33:12.506
I say reform the Reds with a rope.

33:12.507 --> 33:14.551
Can I quote you on that, Sheriff?

33:14.552 --> 33:15.844
Certainly, my boy.

33:15.845 --> 33:19.180
Sheriff Hartman pledges to
reform the Reds with a rope.

33:19.181 --> 33:21.348
That's worth a good 600,000 votes.

33:21.349 --> 33:23.184
Plus a couple of
100,000 colored votes,

33:23.185 --> 33:25.895
so when that baby drops through
the trap, you guys are a shoo-in.

33:25.896 --> 33:28.064
Are you implying
that the Mayor and I

33:28.065 --> 33:29.774
are playing politics
with a man's life?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.526
Oh, am I glad to get
out of this friggin' town.

33:32.527 --> 33:36.122
That cuts both ways, Johnson.
Both ways.

33:36.656 --> 33:39.585
American.
City Press.

33:40.202 --> 33:42.244
See you around, fellas.

33:42.245 --> 33:46.050
Goodbye, Sheriff.
Gonna miss you. "Honest."

33:47.710 --> 33:49.461
Well, chums,
I got to pick up my girl.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.545
We're gonna have dinner
before we get on that train.

33:51.546 --> 33:53.641
Let's have one for the road.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.643
Mr. Johnson.

33:56.093 --> 33:58.887
If you have any
advice to give me...

33:58.888 --> 34:00.180
Sure, kid.

34:00.181 --> 34:02.264
Never end a sentence
with a preposition,

34:02.265 --> 34:04.567
never draw to an inside straight,

34:05.435 --> 34:08.822
and never, never get caught
in the can with Bensinger.

34:09.357 --> 34:10.398
So long, Hildy.

34:10.399 --> 34:11.483
Take care of yourself.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.360
Drop us a postcard, you stewbum.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.902
Any of you ever get
to Philadelphia,

34:14.904 --> 34:16.445
for Christ's sake,
don't look me up

34:16.446 --> 34:18.739
because from now on I'm
not associating with riffraff.

34:18.739 --> 34:19.949
Cheers!

34:19.951 --> 34:22.494
 Not a soul down on the corner

34:22.495 --> 34:25.413
 That's a pretty certain sign

34:25.414 --> 34:28.833
 That wedding bells are breaking up

34:28.833 --> 34:33.003
 That old gang of mine

34:33.004 --> 34:36.850
 All the boys are
singing love songs

34:36.926 --> 34:41.638
 They forgot sweet Adeline

34:41.639 --> 34:45.568
 Those wedding bells
are breaking up

34:45.725 --> 34:50.281
 That old gang of mine

35:03.119 --> 35:05.754
Could you help me again, please?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.834
I just can't seem
to shake this cold.

35:10.835 --> 35:13.596
Yeah, summer colds.
They're the worst.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.815
All right, unlock the handcuffs.

35:26.475 --> 35:27.767
Was your dinner okay?

35:27.768 --> 35:29.810
It was fine,
but they forgot the ketchup.

35:29.811 --> 35:32.323
That's just too bad.
In here.

35:36.109 --> 35:38.320
Earl, this is Dr. Eggelhofer.

35:38.321 --> 35:39.653
He's going to examine you.

35:39.654 --> 35:41.281
Oh, oh, hi, Doc.

35:41.282 --> 35:43.792
Good evening, sir.
Sit down, please.

35:48.164 --> 35:50.206
You gonna stick some pins into me

35:50.207 --> 35:52.792
and hit my knees with a hammer?

35:52.793 --> 35:54.336
That is very old-fashioned.

35:54.337 --> 35:56.338
I'm merely going to ask
you a few questions.

35:56.339 --> 35:57.421
Oh, thank you.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.174
Now, Mr. Williams,
are you aware

35:59.175 --> 36:01.092
of what's going to
happen to you tomorrow?

36:01.093 --> 36:02.177
They're gonna hang me.

36:02.178 --> 36:03.677
And how do you feel about that?

36:03.678 --> 36:05.055
Well, to tell the truth,

36:05.056 --> 36:08.400
I'll be glad to get out of that cell.
It's so drafty.

36:09.310 --> 36:11.519
See? I told you.
He's 100 percent sane.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.855
It says here that you are,
by profession, a baker.

36:14.856 --> 36:17.525
That's right.
I'm... I'm a specialty baker.

36:17.526 --> 36:20.403
You know, uh, pretzels and
breadsticks and bagels.

36:20.404 --> 36:22.822
You know, I worked for the
same place for five years,

36:22.823 --> 36:24.532
and then one day
they just fired me.

36:24.533 --> 36:25.617
What was the reason?

36:25.618 --> 36:27.701
'Cause I put those things
in the fortune cookies.

36:27.702 --> 36:28.702
What things?

36:28.703 --> 36:30.413
Free Sacco and Vanzetti.

36:30.414 --> 36:32.082
Pretty sneaky, those Bolsheviks.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.208
Who's a Bolshevik?

36:33.209 --> 36:36.544
According to this, you
were arrested in 1925

36:36.545 --> 36:38.546
for illegal possession
of explosives.

36:38.547 --> 36:40.215
Oh, yes.
Well, I don't know

36:40.216 --> 36:42.550
how you feel about
Wall Street, Doctor,

36:42.551 --> 36:45.387
but I mailed this
shoebox to JP Morgan

36:45.388 --> 36:46.762
with a time bomb in it.

36:46.763 --> 36:50.684
And it came back because
of insufficient postage.

36:50.685 --> 36:53.654
Blew the whole roof
off my boarding house.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.690
We should send them all
back where they came from.

36:56.691 --> 36:59.159
I come from Fargo, North Dakota.

37:01.778 --> 37:05.115
Tell me, Mr. Williams,
were you unhappy as a child?

37:05.116 --> 37:06.241
Not really.

37:06.242 --> 37:08.285
I had a perfectly normal childhood.

37:08.286 --> 37:10.245
I see.
You wanted to kill your father

37:10.246 --> 37:12.079
and sleep with your mother.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.665
If he's gonna talk dirty...

37:13.666 --> 37:15.542
When you were in grammar school,

37:15.543 --> 37:17.711
did you practice self-abuse?

37:17.712 --> 37:19.462
No, sir. I don't believe in it.

37:19.463 --> 37:22.257
I would never abuse
myself or anybody else.

37:22.258 --> 37:24.759
I love people, I love all people.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.520
I suppose that cop
committed suicide.

37:28.431 --> 37:30.724
Let us get back to masturbation.

37:30.725 --> 37:33.861
Did your father ever
catch you in the act?

37:34.020 --> 37:35.936
Oh, my father was...
was never home.

37:35.937 --> 37:38.991
He was a conductor on
the Chicago-Northwestern.

37:39.649 --> 37:41.026
Very significant.

37:41.027 --> 37:43.819
Your father wore a uniform
just like that policeman.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.990
And when he pulled out the gun,
an obvious phallic symbol,

37:46.991 --> 37:48.450
you thought he was your father

37:48.451 --> 37:51.544
and was going to use
it to hurt your mother.

37:51.953 --> 37:53.330
He's crazy.

37:53.331 --> 37:56.291
Let us then try to reconstruct
your thought process

37:56.292 --> 37:58.469
at the time of the crime.

37:58.753 --> 38:00.712
May I borrow your gun, please?

38:00.713 --> 38:02.589
Oh, sure thing.

38:02.590 --> 38:04.724
Get up,
Mr. Williams.

38:04.966 --> 38:07.968
All right, you are standing on
that corner with those leaflets,

38:07.969 --> 38:11.306
I am the policeman. I come up to
you and tell you to move along.

38:11.307 --> 38:13.849
You refuse, I draw my gun.

38:13.850 --> 38:18.822
Now, I want you to tell me
exactly what you thought

38:19.231 --> 38:22.243
and show me exactly what you did.

38:24.654 --> 38:26.205
Exactly?

38:26.781 --> 38:29.990
 Gee,
I get that lonesome feeling

38:29.991 --> 38:33.577
 When I hear those
church bells chime

38:33.578 --> 38:36.881
 Those wedding bells
are breaking up

38:38.501 --> 38:39.875
What the hell is that?

38:39.876 --> 38:42.263
Maybe somebody else
is throwing a party.

38:43.214 --> 38:45.765
Must be a riot or a jailbreak.

38:51.806 --> 38:53.515
Hey, Jacobi, what's the matter?

38:53.516 --> 38:55.182
What's going on down there?

38:55.183 --> 38:56.308
Somebody get away?

38:56.309 --> 38:57.352
Who was it?

38:57.353 --> 38:59.478
Hey fatso, what happened?

38:59.479 --> 39:02.983
Go screw! All right,
spread out, you guys.

39:02.984 --> 39:04.526
Watch the gate.

39:04.527 --> 39:06.026
Somebody cover the west wall.

39:06.027 --> 39:08.414
And the rest of you, follow me.

39:09.865 --> 39:11.533
Get away from those windows.

39:11.534 --> 39:12.616
What's the excitement?

39:12.617 --> 39:14.502
Earl Williams escaped.

39:15.246 --> 39:16.246
Williams?

39:16.247 --> 39:17.630
Jesus!

39:22.378 --> 39:24.462
Earl Williams just busted
out of the County jail.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.298
Got clean away.
Cops all over the place.

39:26.299 --> 39:27.424
Lots of shooting.

39:27.425 --> 39:30.509
Don't know if it's from
Williams or at Williams.

39:30.510 --> 39:32.188
No, I don't know how it happened.

39:35.056 --> 39:36.391
Careful, you roughnecks.

39:36.392 --> 39:37.726
Watch where you're shooting.

39:37.727 --> 39:39.185
Stand by.
Call you later.

39:39.186 --> 39:41.103
You bet.
The minute I get anything.

39:41.104 --> 39:42.063
Hang on.

39:42.064 --> 39:43.449
I'm off and running.

39:58.789 --> 40:00.174
Hey, Keppler.

40:03.294 --> 40:04.461
Sir?

40:04.462 --> 40:07.097
Aren't you gonna call
into the office?

40:07.465 --> 40:08.590
You think it's safe?

40:08.591 --> 40:10.935
Those guys couldn't hit anything.

40:12.094 --> 40:14.136
I'm afraid I did something bad.

40:14.137 --> 40:17.024
When the shooting started.
In my pants.

40:21.395 --> 40:23.988
I hope the negative didn't get wet.

40:24.941 --> 40:26.107
Uh, Rudy, the phone.

40:26.108 --> 40:27.450
Oh, yes.

40:29.111 --> 40:30.362
What's our number?

40:30.363 --> 40:31.862
You've got a direct line there.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.289
Really?

40:34.699 --> 40:36.000
Hello?

40:36.576 --> 40:39.003
Hello, Mr. Duffy.
This is Keppler.

40:39.372 --> 40:40.996
Rudy Keppler.

40:40.997 --> 40:43.333
Yes, I'm in the Criminal
Courts building,

40:43.334 --> 40:46.795
but it looks like there's going
to be no hanging tomorrow.

40:46.796 --> 40:49.848
No. No reprieve from the
Governor as far as I know.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.802
I can't hear you, Mr. Duffy, with
all the shooting and the sirens.

40:53.803 --> 40:55.311
Oh, shit!

40:55.805 --> 40:58.898
Duffy, it's Hildy Johnson.
Get me Walter, quick.

41:05.815 --> 41:08.984
Switch that call in here,
will you? It's Hildy.

41:08.985 --> 41:10.192
What'd I tell you?

41:10.193 --> 41:12.279
I knew the minute he saw
we were replacing him

41:12.280 --> 41:15.740
with that snot-nosed kid, it would
be such a blow to his ego...

41:15.741 --> 41:18.660
Look, Hildy, if you want your
job back, it's too late.

41:18.661 --> 41:20.954
I got a first-class guy
coverin' that story.

41:20.955 --> 41:22.998
Yeah, just met him.
Full of piss and vinegar.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.165
Now get this, Walter.

41:24.166 --> 41:25.875
Earl Williams just
lammed out of jail.

41:25.876 --> 41:27.168
That's right.
You heard me.

41:27.169 --> 41:30.472
Holy smoke! Hold everything
in the composing room.

41:32.133 --> 41:34.768
Well, thanks for the call, Hildy.

41:35.136 --> 41:37.846
I know you're in a hurry
to catch that train.

41:37.847 --> 41:40.806
Christ, when I think what you
could have done with this story.

41:40.807 --> 41:43.903
Don't worry, Walter.
I'm right on top of it.

41:45.688 --> 41:47.981
Anything I can do for you,
Mr. Johnson?

41:47.982 --> 41:50.284
Yeah. Change your diapers.

41:51.736 --> 41:52.611
What happened?

41:52.612 --> 41:54.696
How did he get out
of your rubber jail?

41:54.697 --> 41:56.530
Any clue to his whereabouts?

41:56.531 --> 41:58.365
We got to have a statement, Pete.

41:58.366 --> 41:59.451
Come on, Pete.

41:59.452 --> 42:02.369
If you'll just shut up I'll
give you a statement.

42:02.370 --> 42:04.205
Mad Dog Williams shot his way out.

42:04.206 --> 42:05.874
My men chased him up
to the top floor,

42:05.875 --> 42:07.416
but he got out through
the skylight.

42:07.417 --> 42:08.959
We've searched the roof, nothing.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.796
We figured he must've slid
down the rain pipe to the street.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.882
Still not straight on what
happened in your office.

42:13.883 --> 42:16.051
I told you Dr. Eggelhofer

42:16.052 --> 42:18.053
was asking him some questions,
very polite.

42:18.054 --> 42:20.387
All of a sudden,
Williams started firing.

42:20.388 --> 42:23.892
One bullet hit the doctor in the
groin, the second one went wild,

42:23.893 --> 42:26.143
and the third shot
just grazed my ear.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.270
One more inch and... Oh, boy.

42:28.271 --> 42:31.399
What we want to know is,
where did Williams get the gun?

42:31.400 --> 42:33.902
Yeah, well, tha-that's what
I'd like to know, myself.

42:33.903 --> 42:35.277
Was it smuggled into his cell?

42:35.278 --> 42:37.656
Maybe under the roast
beef and Brussels sprouts?

42:37.657 --> 42:40.200
You sure that Chaplain's a
Methodist, not a Communist?

42:40.201 --> 42:42.243
Is this the work of
outside agitators?

42:42.244 --> 42:45.914
Boys, boys, I assure you I'll
follow up every single lead.

42:45.915 --> 42:50.678
Right now, my entire force
plus 200 special deputies...

42:51.586 --> 42:55.473
Make way. Make way.
Make way!

42:55.841 --> 42:57.466
What happened in there, Doc?

42:57.467 --> 42:59.135
Care to give us your version?

42:59.136 --> 43:00.428
Is Williams sane or insane?

43:00.429 --> 43:02.931
Please, gentlemen,
no statements, no questions.

43:02.932 --> 43:04.723
I'm in terrible pain

43:04.724 --> 43:07.644
after what he did to me,
that fruitcake.

43:07.645 --> 43:09.229
Stand back, let him through.

43:09.230 --> 43:10.896
Where are they taking me?

43:10.897 --> 43:13.190
Passavant hospital.
Just 5 minutes from here.

43:13.191 --> 43:15.067
No. No.
No. No.

43:15.068 --> 43:18.113
I want to go to the
Allgemeines Krankenhaus

43:18.114 --> 43:19.780
on Alserstrasse.

43:19.781 --> 43:20.949
Where is that?

43:20.950 --> 43:23.325
In Vienna.
I do not trust American doctors.

43:23.326 --> 43:24.785
You'll never make it to Vienna.

43:24.786 --> 43:28.789
In this case, I want a big
mirror and some instruments.

43:28.790 --> 43:30.791
I shall operate on myself.

43:30.792 --> 43:32.961
Is this your first trip
to the United States?

43:32.962 --> 43:34.336
How do you like Chicago?

43:34.337 --> 43:35.714
Sprechen sie Yiddish?

43:35.715 --> 43:38.559
Where'd he get you, Doc?
Right in the old love bells?

43:40.093 --> 43:42.219
Pete, if you don't mind,
there's a couple of things

43:42.220 --> 43:43.680
about that story that bother me.

43:43.681 --> 43:45.849
Is that so?
Well, you're bothering me.

43:45.850 --> 43:47.475
You don't work here
anymore, Johnson.

43:47.476 --> 43:49.643
I don't have to talk to you.

43:49.644 --> 43:52.147
Jennie, will you mop
up my floor, please?

43:52.148 --> 43:53.522
There's blood all over it.

43:53.523 --> 43:56.026
Right away, Sheriff.
As soon as I get a new bucket.

43:56.027 --> 43:57.943
I've got my own ideas
about the escape.

43:57.944 --> 43:58.944
You do?

43:58.945 --> 44:01.156
Oh, yeah. I think you let
Earl Williams out yourself,

44:01.157 --> 44:02.948
so he could vote for
you next Tuesday.

44:02.949 --> 44:04.627
Very funny.

44:24.764 --> 44:26.388
What happened to
your bucket, Jennie?

44:26.389 --> 44:27.474
He shot it.

44:27.475 --> 44:28.475
Who shot it?

44:28.476 --> 44:29.517
That Earl Williams.

44:29.518 --> 44:32.604
I was cleaning the office next
door when it all happened.

44:32.605 --> 44:33.605
You saw it?

44:33.606 --> 44:35.564
No.
But I could hear what was going on.

44:35.565 --> 44:36.690
What?

44:36.691 --> 44:39.527
I better keep my mouth shut,
'cause he wouldn't like it.

44:39.528 --> 44:40.528
Who?

44:40.529 --> 44:42.279
The Sheriff.
He'd fire me.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.783
Jennie, we've been
friends for a long time.

44:44.784 --> 44:48.452
You told me that your husband could
play his dentures with a teaspoon,

44:48.453 --> 44:49.995
who got him on the Amateur Hour?

44:49.996 --> 44:52.508
Well, I really shouldn't,
but I... I...

45:07.139 --> 45:09.014
Attention all cars, attention.

45:09.015 --> 45:11.892
A man answering Earl Williams'
description has been seen boarding

45:11.893 --> 45:14.437
southbound trolley at
Cottage Grove and Austen.

45:14.438 --> 45:15.780
Please investigate.

45:20.902 --> 45:22.654
Earl Williams has been reported

45:22.655 --> 45:24.114
in vicinity of Wrigley building.

45:24.115 --> 45:25.541
Proceed there immediately.

45:30.871 --> 45:32.163
Here's a late report.

45:32.164 --> 45:34.416
Earl Williams has just
been spotted in a rowboat

45:34.417 --> 45:36.926
on Lake Michigan
disguised as a nun.

46:10.786 --> 46:12.463
Fruitcake!

46:15.291 --> 46:17.258
Fruitcake!

46:17.752 --> 46:19.511
Fruitcake!

46:19.879 --> 46:21.962
Dr. Eggelhofer is on his
way to Passavant Hospital

46:21.963 --> 46:23.298
to operate on himself.

46:23.299 --> 46:24.633
You heard me.

46:24.634 --> 46:26.343
Tightest dragnet in
Chicago's history

46:26.344 --> 46:27.802
is happening in the North side.

46:27.803 --> 46:30.764
Sheriff Hartman expects Williams
to be recaptured any moment now.

46:30.765 --> 46:33.140
Which means they don't have
the slightest idea where he is.

46:33.141 --> 46:35.726
Here's a cute little sideline,
I just spoke to the hangman.

46:35.727 --> 46:38.313
Whether they get Williams
back or not, he gets his $50.

46:38.314 --> 46:39.481
It's play or pay.

46:39.482 --> 46:41.148
Hold on,
I have something coming up.

46:41.149 --> 46:42.691
This is Schwartz.
Give me rewrite.

46:42.692 --> 46:45.320
Mr. Schwartz, your wife left
this for you. Stuffed cabbage.

46:45.321 --> 46:46.363
Ugh.

46:46.364 --> 46:49.156
A tear-gas bomb went off accidentally
in one of the Sheriff's cars.

46:49.157 --> 46:51.242
The following deputies needed
emergency treatment:

46:51.243 --> 46:52.911
Ted Kowalski, Philip Lustgarten...

46:52.912 --> 46:55.664
She said to be sure to
bring home the pot.

46:55.665 --> 46:58.416
Joe Matsburg, Wally Coogan,
William Gilhooley.

46:58.417 --> 47:00.543
The Crime Commission
has offered $1,000

47:00.544 --> 47:01.836
for the capture of Williams.

47:01.837 --> 47:03.380
No one knows about the gun.

47:03.381 --> 47:05.172
Maybe the Reds dropped
it by parachute.

47:05.173 --> 47:07.634
How're we doing?
Any flashes, any scoops?

47:07.635 --> 47:09.219
It's almost deadline time,
you know.

47:09.220 --> 47:10.345
You still here?

47:10.346 --> 47:13.472
Showing the kid the ropes.
Listen, Rudy, the Mayor's car drove up.

47:13.473 --> 47:15.350
See if you can get a
statement from him.

47:15.351 --> 47:16.892
The Mayor just showed up.
More later.

47:16.893 --> 47:18.946
There's gonna be fireworks.

47:27.697 --> 47:29.531
This is Hildy, get me Walter.

47:29.532 --> 47:31.782
I forgot to tell you,
Miss Peggy Grant called.

47:31.783 --> 47:34.244
Peggy? Oh, my God,
I forgot. Walter?

47:34.245 --> 47:35.829
Will you get out of here?

47:35.830 --> 47:37.329
Walter, I got the story.

47:37.330 --> 47:39.090
It's a pip,
and I got it exclusive.

47:39.207 --> 47:42.042
That's my Hildy.
You see why I love you?

47:42.043 --> 47:43.712
Okay, let's have it.

47:43.713 --> 47:46.423
It's the jailbreak of your dreams.

47:46.424 --> 47:49.259
No. No Bolshevik plot.
The whole thing was an inside job.

47:49.260 --> 47:51.720
And guess where he got the gun?

47:51.721 --> 47:53.597
All loaded and ready to fire?

47:53.598 --> 47:55.815
Damn it, hang on, will you?

47:57.392 --> 48:01.906
Yeah? Peggy.
Hi, baby. Hi.

48:02.064 --> 48:05.159
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late, darling. But...

48:05.400 --> 48:06.735
No, I'm not getting drunk.

48:06.736 --> 48:08.661
The party's already over.
It's just...

48:09.488 --> 48:11.740
For God's sake, wait
a minute, Walter.

48:11.741 --> 48:14.284
We could save time, love.
Instead of me coming downtown,

48:14.285 --> 48:17.621
why don't you grab a cab and pick
me up on the way. How about that?

48:17.622 --> 48:19.255
You're a sweetheart.

48:19.539 --> 48:21.540
Okay, Walter, here we go.

48:21.541 --> 48:25.170
That profound thinker from Vienna,
Dr. Max J. Eggelhofer

48:25.171 --> 48:27.714
in order to prove some
cockamamie theory

48:27.715 --> 48:30.175
Decides to reenact the crime.

48:30.176 --> 48:32.010
Naturally, he needs a gun, huh.

48:32.011 --> 48:33.978
Who do you think supplied it?

48:34.013 --> 48:36.430
Don't tell me.
Sheriff Peter B. Hartman?

48:36.431 --> 48:38.724
That's right.
"B" for brains.

48:38.725 --> 48:40.602
That idiot hands his
gun to the Professor,

48:40.603 --> 48:42.187
the Professor points
it at Williams,

48:42.188 --> 48:44.438
Williams takes the gun from
the Professor and shoots him,

48:44.439 --> 48:45.815
right where the money is.

48:45.816 --> 48:48.911
That's beautiful.
Where's Eggelhofer now?

48:49.277 --> 48:51.278
Okay, here's what I want you to do.

48:51.279 --> 48:53.697
Get to the hospital and
get ahold of that bullet.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.918
So, if the Sheriff tries
to deny the story...

48:56.202 --> 48:59.578
Hold it. Walter, I'm not going to any
hospital, not stealing any bullets.

48:59.579 --> 49:01.288
There may be further developments.

49:01.289 --> 49:03.582
In the meantime,
bat me out a lead.

49:03.583 --> 49:06.795
You know, "Sheriff Hartman:
Stooge of Stalin or simply stupid?"

49:06.796 --> 49:09.055
If we move fast,
we can make the early edition.

49:09.257 --> 49:11.925
You don't understand, Walter.
I've quit.

49:11.926 --> 49:14.176
I gave you that story
as a personal favor

49:14.177 --> 49:17.222
because you're such a warm,
loveable human being but that's it.

49:17.223 --> 49:20.267
My girl's picking me up in 15
minutes, it's goodbye Chicago,

49:20.268 --> 49:22.820
goodbye Examiner, goodbye to you.

49:23.646 --> 49:25.196
You maniac.

49:46.377 --> 49:48.386
Listen, you...

49:56.052 --> 49:57.511
not even their wives.

49:57.512 --> 50:00.015
Now you want to throw
it all away for a dame?

50:00.016 --> 50:02.767
You got the brains of a pancake.

50:02.768 --> 50:04.819
Same to you, buster.

50:07.939 --> 50:10.399
How is this going to affect
the election, Your Honor?

50:10.400 --> 50:11.985
Will it cost you the colored vote?

50:11.986 --> 50:13.570
The law and order vote?
No comments.

50:13.571 --> 50:15.196
You're gonna stand there all night

50:15.197 --> 50:16.698
giving us that "no comment" crap?

50:16.699 --> 50:17.699
No comment.

50:17.700 --> 50:20.201
The way we see it, you've got
your ass in a sling, Your Honor.

50:20.202 --> 50:21.494
Rubbish.

50:21.495 --> 50:23.997
The voters of Chicago will
not let themselves be swayed

50:23.998 --> 50:25.831
by this unfortunate incident.

50:25.832 --> 50:28.460
They have complete
confidence in their Mayor,

50:28.461 --> 50:31.212
just as I have complete
faith in Sheriff Hartman.

50:31.213 --> 50:34.174
And I'm sure you boys share
that faith and confidence.

50:34.175 --> 50:35.300
No comment.

50:35.301 --> 50:37.469
Sorry to break in but
we've located Williams.

50:37.470 --> 50:38.552
This time, for real.

50:38.553 --> 50:39.888
Where?
On North Wabash,

50:39.889 --> 50:42.015
at the offices of the Friends
of American Liberty.

50:42.016 --> 50:43.974
One of our patrols spotted
him in the alley.

50:43.975 --> 50:45.726
All right.
Get every available man.

50:45.727 --> 50:47.103
Seal off the whole area.

50:47.104 --> 50:50.272
But remember, God damn it,
I want him taken alive.

50:50.273 --> 50:51.232
Check.

50:51.233 --> 50:52.691
There's your story, boys.

50:52.692 --> 50:54.452
Wait for us, Fatso.

51:02.078 --> 51:04.745
Okay, Pete.
Now, suppose you explain it to me.

51:04.746 --> 51:06.790
How the hell can a guy
escape with a double guard

51:06.791 --> 51:09.125
around the jail and
200 extra deputies?

51:09.126 --> 51:10.751
Well, it could happen to anybody.

51:10.752 --> 51:12.629
It wouldn't have
happened to Prohaska.

51:12.630 --> 51:15.589
I knew I should've put him on
the ticket instead of you.

51:15.590 --> 51:17.183
You... you...
you piss-brain.

51:18.427 --> 51:19.552
Please, Herbie,

51:19.553 --> 51:22.471
I've always been a good party man.
A team player.

51:22.472 --> 51:25.433
Jesus, we're having that fund-raising
dinner at the Palmer House.

51:25.434 --> 51:26.851
All the big money is there.

51:26.852 --> 51:29.104
I'm about to make a pitch
for campaign contributions,

51:29.105 --> 51:31.532
and then I get news like this.

51:31.773 --> 51:34.150
Calm down, Herbie.
It's all over now.

51:34.151 --> 51:35.402
You've heard the latest.

51:35.403 --> 51:37.654
They've got Williams.
He can't get away.

51:37.655 --> 51:40.614
What do you mean, he can't get away?
He got away, didn't he?

51:40.615 --> 51:41.866
Herbie, I personally...

51:41.867 --> 51:43.159
Don't call me Herbie any more.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.120
From now on, it's Your Honor.

51:45.121 --> 51:46.629
Yes.

51:46.956 --> 51:47.956
Your Honor?

51:47.957 --> 51:49.291
I'm warning you, Pete,

51:49.292 --> 51:51.126
if you don't have
Williams on the gallows

51:51.127 --> 51:53.043
by 7:00 a.m., then God help you.

51:53.044 --> 51:56.389
Because you might just as well
go ahead and hang yourself.

51:58.301 --> 51:59.633
 Am I awake now?

51:59.634 --> 52:01.686
 Or am I dreaming?

52:02.305 --> 52:04.180
 Congratulate me, step right up

52:04.181 --> 52:05.347
 Shake my hand

52:05.348 --> 52:08.268
Uh, excuse me.
Which way is the Sheriff's office?

52:08.269 --> 52:09.778
That way.

52:21.741 --> 52:23.033
Uh, Sheriff Hartman?

52:23.034 --> 52:24.417
In here.

52:24.619 --> 52:26.077
Oh, my name is Plunkett.

52:26.078 --> 52:27.579
I just came up from Springfield.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.039
I got somethin' for you.
What?

52:29.040 --> 52:30.206
From the Governor.

52:30.207 --> 52:31.333
What's from the Governor?

52:31.334 --> 52:32.833
It's a reprieve for Earl Williams.

52:32.834 --> 52:33.834
For who?

52:33.835 --> 52:34.920
Earl Williams.

52:34.921 --> 52:37.005
What a hassle getting
over here from the station.

52:37.006 --> 52:39.341
All those police cars on the
wrong side of the street

52:39.342 --> 52:40.634
and runnin' the red lights.

52:40.635 --> 52:42.177
Is this a joke or something?

52:42.178 --> 52:44.095
The Governor has a
commission to consider

52:44.096 --> 52:45.971
last-minute appeals for clemency.

52:45.972 --> 52:47.349
He can't do that to us.

52:47.350 --> 52:49.351
Oh, there was a stack
of mail this high

52:49.352 --> 52:51.685
and a telegram this long
with 4,000 signatures.

52:51.686 --> 52:53.104
How do we know this is not fake?

52:53.105 --> 52:55.190
Yeah. Could be some sort
of a Communist trick.

52:55.191 --> 52:57.817
Oh, no. I was right there with
the Governor when he signed it.

52:57.818 --> 53:00.028
Get the Governor on the phone.
Oh, you can't.

53:00.029 --> 53:01.862
We can't?
He's gone fishing.

53:01.863 --> 53:05.325
Just him, an Indian guide, and
a canoe. No phone, no nothin'.

53:05.326 --> 53:07.545
He sure picked a hell
of a time to go fishing.

53:08.412 --> 53:10.080
Excuse me.

53:10.081 --> 53:12.123
Uh, just between us,
it's not really fishing.

53:12.124 --> 53:14.875
Because that Indian
guide is really a girl.

53:14.876 --> 53:17.837
She isn't even Indian.
She's from New Jersey.

53:17.838 --> 53:19.640
Yes, Jacobi.

53:20.216 --> 53:22.560
What? You do?

53:23.176 --> 53:26.689
Are you sure? Herbie. Your Honor!

53:26.721 --> 53:28.649
Hold on a minute.

53:29.307 --> 53:33.546
It's Jacobi. They've got him trapped.
They've surrounded the building.

53:34.730 --> 53:36.273
Tell him to stay on the line.

53:36.274 --> 53:39.702
Stay on the line. Don't
make a move till I say so.

53:41.319 --> 53:43.822
Look, Mr. Plunkett, about this
reprieve, we can't accept it.

53:43.823 --> 53:44.905
But why not?

53:44.906 --> 53:46.031
It wouldn't be legal.

53:46.032 --> 53:48.200
We don't have Earl
Williams in our custody.

53:48.201 --> 53:49.369
You don't?
Where is he?

53:49.370 --> 53:50.370
He escaped.

53:50.371 --> 53:51.620
You saw those police cars.

53:51.621 --> 53:52.913
We're looking for him.

53:52.914 --> 53:54.291
Oh, dear.
That is a problem.

53:54.292 --> 53:55.916
I think I better
phone the Governor.

53:55.917 --> 53:58.295
You can't. He's off fishing.
Remember?

53:58.296 --> 54:01.088
So, why don't you come
back tomorrow morning?

54:01.089 --> 54:03.967
I'm sure by then, we'll have
him back in our jurisdiction.

54:03.968 --> 54:05.760
You mean,
spend the night in Chicago?

54:05.761 --> 54:07.344
Any objections?

54:07.345 --> 54:08.847
Well, no, sirree, Bob.

54:08.848 --> 54:11.098
Trouble is,
I don't know anybody here.

54:11.099 --> 54:12.892
Do you like Chinese food?

54:12.893 --> 54:15.562
Well, I'm not really hungry,
I had a sandwich on the train.

54:15.563 --> 54:17.856
But you didn't have
a Chinese sandwich.

54:17.857 --> 54:19.024
I never heard of it.

54:19.025 --> 54:20.649
You'll never forget it.

54:20.650 --> 54:22.702
Ask for Madame Chow.

54:22.778 --> 54:24.820
Tell her the Green Hornet sent you.

54:24.821 --> 54:25.946
The Green Hornet?

54:25.947 --> 54:28.617
And just put everything on my tab.

54:28.618 --> 54:29.993
Well, that's very kind of you.

54:29.994 --> 54:31.368
Not at all.
Not at all.

54:31.369 --> 54:32.913
And you can use my chopsticks.

54:32.914 --> 54:33.954
Oh, thank you.

54:33.955 --> 54:36.091
Uh, goodbye, Sheriff.

54:39.712 --> 54:42.254
He's waiting for instructions.
What are we gonna do?

54:42.255 --> 54:43.798
Tell him to shoot to kill.

54:43.799 --> 54:44.799
What?

54:44.800 --> 54:46.383
Shoot to kill, I said.

54:46.384 --> 54:48.677
I... I don't know, Herbie.
What about that reprieve?

54:48.678 --> 54:49.888
I-If it ever comes out.

54:49.889 --> 54:51.640
Nobody reprieved that
policeman he shot.

54:51.641 --> 54:53.265
There was no clemency, either.

54:53.266 --> 54:55.319
Do what I tell you!

54:55.519 --> 54:59.739
Jacobi, you there?
Listen. Shoot to kill!

54:59.856 --> 55:00.981
You heard me.

55:00.982 --> 55:02.817
Okay, okay, Sheriff.

55:02.818 --> 55:04.486
Only, I thought you
wanted him alive.

55:04.487 --> 55:06.413
Anything you say, Sheriff.

55:11.369 --> 55:13.954
We know you're up there, Williams.

55:13.955 --> 55:16.507
Now, this is your last chance.

55:17.541 --> 55:19.834
Throw the gun out the window

55:19.835 --> 55:23.097
and come out with your hands up.

55:23.673 --> 55:25.507
Or we'll smoke you out.

55:25.508 --> 55:29.511
New instructions.
No bullhorn, no tear gas.

55:29.512 --> 55:32.439
We go in there,
and we go in shooting.

55:38.478 --> 55:41.949
All set!
Let's go, men!

55:43.442 --> 55:45.110
Give us a break, fellas,
we're Press.

55:45.111 --> 55:48.070
Christ, we're gonna miss the
whole thing. Come on, will you?

55:48.071 --> 55:49.372
Stand back.

56:20.605 --> 56:23.656
Do you suppose there's
a bathroom around here?

56:37.914 --> 56:39.215
Ah.

56:45.253 --> 56:47.297
The future Mrs. Johnson,
I presume?

56:47.298 --> 56:48.757
Been waiting long, darling?

56:48.758 --> 56:52.394
Only my whole life.
I'm sorry I was tied up.

56:54.721 --> 56:56.981
Oh, like all the orchids
in the Bahamas.

56:58.850 --> 57:01.937
What do you say we pick up the
bags first then eat at the station?

57:01.938 --> 57:04.438
Let's.
Have you got the tickets?

57:04.439 --> 57:07.025
Have I got the tickets.
A lower for you and an upper for me.

57:07.026 --> 57:09.027
Oh, no, darling.
You take the lower.

57:09.028 --> 57:11.372
Tell you what?
Why don't we both take the lower?

57:12.365 --> 57:13.739
What about the conductor?

57:13.740 --> 57:15.626
He can have the upper.

57:16.202 --> 57:17.953
Where to, Mac?

57:17.954 --> 57:19.213
Huh?

57:19.497 --> 57:21.206
Uh-oh.
Oh.

57:21.207 --> 57:24.583
Uh, no place, huh?
Just stay here. God damned idiot.

57:24.584 --> 57:25.794
Who?
Me.

57:25.795 --> 57:27.711
I left the wedding rings
in the pressroom.

57:27.712 --> 57:29.381
I hope the bums
haven't stolen them.

57:29.382 --> 57:30.890
I'll be back.

57:40.393 --> 57:42.227
You don't mind waiting, do you?

57:42.228 --> 57:43.979
What's there to mind?

57:43.980 --> 57:45.146
The night's young,

57:45.147 --> 57:48.117
the orchids are smelling,
the meter is running.

57:49.484 --> 57:51.579
Just made another nickel.

58:11.173 --> 58:13.559
Jesus Christ Almighty.

58:16.178 --> 58:17.937
Shut the door.

58:19.307 --> 58:21.891
Okay, okay, Earl.
Hey, just put the gun down.

58:21.892 --> 58:24.153
I said, shut the door!

58:27.189 --> 58:28.857
How in the hell did you...

58:28.858 --> 58:30.984
I've been hanging in the airshaft,

58:30.985 --> 58:33.028
but I couldn't hold on any longer.

58:33.029 --> 58:36.332
They... They got me in the arm.
Don't move!

58:37.450 --> 58:40.702
You realize they're looking
for you all over Chicago?

58:40.703 --> 58:42.420
You cops.

58:44.664 --> 58:46.665
You're all so dumb.

58:46.666 --> 58:49.376
I'm not a cop, Earl.
You know me. Hildy Johnson.

58:49.377 --> 58:51.971
I interviewed you in your cell.

58:53.215 --> 58:58.269
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Yeah. I read every word.

58:59.055 --> 59:02.766
"An outraged minnow battling

59:02.767 --> 59:05.903
against the tides of injustice."

59:06.395 --> 59:07.947
I liked that.

59:11.067 --> 59:12.493
Earl?

59:13.903 --> 59:15.412
Earl?

59:19.533 --> 59:21.418
Oh, oh... oh.

59:28.084 --> 59:31.419
Hello. Yeah, Duffy.
This is Hildy. Get me Walter.

59:31.420 --> 59:34.807
Well, I don't give a damn!
Just get him. This is urgent.

59:44.599 --> 59:46.725
Walter?
W-Walter, listen.

59:46.726 --> 59:49.437
Will you for Christ's sake listen?
Now get this.

59:49.438 --> 59:52.816
I'm only going to say it once,
I've got Earl Williams.

59:52.817 --> 59:56.161
What's the gag?
You got him where?

59:57.446 --> 01:00:00.958
Honest to God?
You swear?

01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:04.493
Jesus!

01:00:04.494 --> 01:00:07.213
Examiner captures Earl Williams.

01:00:07.373 --> 01:00:08.622
I'll be right over.

01:00:08.623 --> 01:00:11.634
You better. Because I don't know
how long I can keep him sewed up.

01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:15.346
Damn it,
there's someone at the door.

01:00:17.592 --> 01:00:19.350
Just a minute.

01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:33.239
Coming.

01:00:34.317 --> 01:00:35.483
Mollie.
Where is he?

01:00:35.484 --> 01:00:37.736
Who? Who? Earl.
I hear they got him trapped.

01:00:37.737 --> 01:00:39.029
For God's sake, tell me where.

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.156
I don't know.
Ask down in the Sheriff's office.

01:00:41.157 --> 01:00:43.074
They wouldn't give
me the time of day.

01:00:43.075 --> 01:00:45.534
There's nothing you can do here.
Go home and wait.

01:00:45.535 --> 01:00:47.621
Wait for what?
The morning papers,

01:00:47.622 --> 01:00:49.789
so I can read how they
shot him down like a dog,

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.041
the yellow murderers?

01:00:51.042 --> 01:00:53.043
And who's gonna give a damn?
Not you guys.

01:00:53.044 --> 01:00:55.170
'Cause all you care about
is a stinking headline.

01:00:55.171 --> 01:00:56.971
Hello, Mollie.

01:00:58.007 --> 01:00:59.475
Earl.

01:00:59.926 --> 01:01:02.177
Thank you for the roses.

01:01:02.178 --> 01:01:04.261
Earl, what have they done to you?

01:01:04.262 --> 01:01:07.098
They were after me with
searchlights, but I fooled them.

01:01:07.099 --> 01:01:08.642
We gotta get him to a doctor.

01:01:08.643 --> 01:01:09.643
A doctor?

01:01:09.644 --> 01:01:12.436
He'd just turn him over to the cops.
And we don't want that, do we?

01:01:12.437 --> 01:01:14.105
So I'll fool them again.

01:01:14.106 --> 01:01:16.191
I'll bleed to death before
they can hang me.

01:01:16.192 --> 01:01:18.068
No, Earl.
You mustn't talk like that.

01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:19.985
Hold the towel,
stick your arm out.

01:01:19.986 --> 01:01:21.821
Hey, hey, this isn't my suit,
you know.

01:01:21.822 --> 01:01:23.531
It's government property.

01:01:23.532 --> 01:01:25.583
They'll be very sore.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:30.287
Who's that?

01:01:30.288 --> 01:01:31.539
It's me, Peggy.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.300
Peggy who? I'll be right with you.

01:01:34.377 --> 01:01:36.220
Keep him quiet.

01:01:38.463 --> 01:01:41.225
Peggy!
What's on your mind?

01:01:42.218 --> 01:01:43.551
Oh, nothing in particular.

01:01:43.552 --> 01:01:45.387
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

01:01:45.388 --> 01:01:47.555
I didn't forget.
The taxi, downstairs.

01:01:47.556 --> 01:01:50.642
You might be interested to know,
the cab driver just proposed to me.

01:01:50.643 --> 01:01:53.018
And as soon as the meter hits $10,
I'm accepting.

01:01:53.019 --> 01:01:54.271
Don't worry.
I got the rings.

01:01:54.272 --> 01:01:56.648
I need a few minutes.
I'm waiting for Walter to show up.

01:01:56.649 --> 01:01:58.858
You're not getting involved
with Burns again?

01:01:58.859 --> 01:02:00.317
Of course not.
God forbid.

01:02:00.318 --> 01:02:02.027
Things are breaking around here,

01:02:02.028 --> 01:02:05.407
this hot potato dropped right in my lap.
As soon as Walter gets here...

01:02:05.408 --> 01:02:06.575
Hildy, what is that?

01:02:06.576 --> 01:02:08.200
Nothing.
Is that a gun?

01:02:08.201 --> 01:02:12.706
Don't be silly. Now, you just take the
cab and you pick up all the bags,

01:02:12.707 --> 01:02:15.332
yours and mine, come back here.
I'll meet you downstairs.

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.668
What are you doing with a gun?

01:02:16.669 --> 01:02:19.044
I'll explain it later, honey.
On the train.

01:02:19.045 --> 01:02:21.046
In that lower berth, hmm? Hmm?

01:02:21.047 --> 01:02:22.308
Okay?

01:02:23.049 --> 01:02:24.684
I can't wait.

01:02:28.139 --> 01:02:30.765
You don't have to
answer this, Mollie,

01:02:30.766 --> 01:02:32.726
but is it true what they
said in the papers?

01:02:32.727 --> 01:02:34.060
What'd they say?

01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:38.406
That you were willing to
marry me on the gallows.

01:02:39.941 --> 01:02:43.621
Well, if it's in the papers,
it must be true.

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:45.614
They wouldn't print a lie.

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:48.909
The funny thing is, the last night in
your place, I was gonna propose to you

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:50.994
but I couldn't go through with it.

01:02:50.995 --> 01:02:52.621
Of course you couldn't.

01:02:52.622 --> 01:02:54.623
Because you know how
I earn my living.

01:02:54.624 --> 01:02:55.956
No. It's not you, Mollie.

01:02:55.957 --> 01:02:57.626
You're the best person I know.

01:02:57.627 --> 01:03:00.086
It's me. I just had
nothing to offer you.

01:03:00.087 --> 01:03:01.420
Earl, hold still.

01:03:01.421 --> 01:03:03.632
I wrote out a will and I
gave it to the warden.

01:03:03.633 --> 01:03:06.185
I'm leaving everything to you.

01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:11.514
A pile of books. Maybe you can get
something for them second hand.

01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:16.237
And a picture of my mother,
in a silver frame

01:03:16.354 --> 01:03:19.406
and a souvenir pillow
from Atlantic City.

01:03:25.695 --> 01:03:27.414
Hey, who locked the door?

01:03:28.448 --> 01:03:29.824
Anybody in there?

01:03:29.825 --> 01:03:31.158
Uh, just a minute.

01:03:31.159 --> 01:03:32.701
Open up, will you?

01:03:32.702 --> 01:03:35.171
In here.
No, that's no good.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.457
You better climb out on... No,
not with that arm.

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:39.960
What the hell's going on?

01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:41.378
Oh, my God!

01:03:41.379 --> 01:03:42.930
The desk!

01:03:47.969 --> 01:03:50.177
For Christ's sake,
we gotta get to the phones.

01:03:50.178 --> 01:03:51.303
What's the trouble?

01:03:51.304 --> 01:03:53.098
Hildy's in there and
won't open the door.

01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:55.182
Hey, Hildy.
What's the big idea?

01:03:55.183 --> 01:03:56.725
Hold your water.
I'm coming.

01:03:56.726 --> 01:03:58.645
Dead quiet.
Don't even breathe.

01:03:58.646 --> 01:04:01.021
I'll be right here, Earl.
I won't leave you.

01:04:01.022 --> 01:04:03.117
Gee, Mollie, you're swell.

01:04:05.695 --> 01:04:07.988
What are you trying to do,
kick down the building?

01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:09.196
This some kind of game?

01:04:09.197 --> 01:04:10.365
You don't own this office.

01:04:10.366 --> 01:04:11.700
Shit, man, we got work to do.

01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.793
Watch your language.

01:04:17.999 --> 01:04:19.623
Oh, I beg your pardon, ma'am.

01:04:19.624 --> 01:04:21.585
Kinda cozy, with the shades down.

01:04:21.586 --> 01:04:23.461
Are you practicing
for your honeymoon?

01:04:23.462 --> 01:04:25.547
City desk. What happened?
Did they get Williams?

01:04:25.548 --> 01:04:27.506
They couldn't catch a
fart in a rain barrel.

01:04:27.507 --> 01:04:30.217
Halloween going on out there.
Murphy. You ready?

01:04:30.218 --> 01:04:32.012
Sheriff's rifle squad
stormed offices

01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:33.637
of Friends of American Liberty,

01:04:33.638 --> 01:04:35.432
fired off 800 rounds of ammunition.

01:04:35.433 --> 01:04:37.183
Casualties included a water cooler,

01:04:37.184 --> 01:04:40.562
two mimeograph machines and
Rufus McBride, a deaf janitor.

01:04:40.563 --> 01:04:42.981
During the shootout, Mrs.
Phoebe DeWolfe, aged 33,

01:04:42.982 --> 01:04:44.858
watching from a window
across the street

01:04:44.859 --> 01:04:47.611
gave premature birth to a
five-and-a-half-pound baby boy.

01:04:47.612 --> 01:04:50.906
Sheriff's deputies examined the infant
to make sure it wasn't Earl Williams,

01:04:50.907 --> 01:04:52.741
who they knew was hiding somewhere.

01:04:52.742 --> 01:04:53.949
What a screw-up.

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:57.244
Right now my boss is throwing
a costume ball in San Simeon

01:04:57.245 --> 01:05:00.582
with Marion Davies and Ronald
Coleman and Vilma Banky.

01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:01.875
Okay.
Here goes.

01:05:01.876 --> 01:05:04.753
Special Deputy Herman Shulty,
the Sheriff's brother-in-law,

01:05:04.754 --> 01:05:07.213
who was leading a search party
through the Wrigley Building

01:05:07.214 --> 01:05:08.964
has sent out a call
for immediate help.

01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:10.884
Somebody stole his police car.

01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:11.967
City desk.

01:05:11.968 --> 01:05:13.094
Give me rewrite.

01:05:13.095 --> 01:05:15.597
The wounded janitor was
taken to Passavant Hospital

01:05:15.598 --> 01:05:18.849
where he joins Dr. Eggelhofer and
the six deputies injured by tear gas.

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.392
They're opening up a special wing.

01:05:20.393 --> 01:05:23.396
Yeah.
There's no point in talking to the Sheriff.

01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:25.147
He doesn't know shit from Shineola.

01:05:25.148 --> 01:05:27.609
Roadblocks have been set
up at main intersections.

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.903
So far, three police cars
have smashed into them.

01:05:29.904 --> 01:05:31.029
Here's the latest.

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.530
Police launch,
acting on a hot tip,

01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:33.907
sank a rowboat in Lake Michigan.

01:05:33.908 --> 01:05:36.826
The suspect turned out to be Sister
Theresa of Immaculate Heart.

01:05:36.827 --> 01:05:39.161
She is resting comfortably in
Jewish Community Hospital.

01:05:39.162 --> 01:05:41.790
You should've been there.
You missed all the excitement.

01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:42.791
Did I?

01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:44.334
Everybody's been so nice to me.

01:05:44.335 --> 01:05:46.503
Coming back here,
they let me pay for the taxi.

01:05:46.504 --> 01:05:47.878
Ah, you're on your way, slick.

01:05:47.879 --> 01:05:51.015
I should've stayed here
with the stuffed cabbage.

01:05:51.342 --> 01:05:54.427
What are you doing in my chair?
Go flop somewhere else.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:56.470
Lay off her.
She's not hurting anything.

01:05:56.471 --> 01:06:00.057
Out, out. Go peddle your
goodies on Division Street.

01:06:00.058 --> 01:06:03.445
If all men were like you,
I'd starve to death.

01:06:04.479 --> 01:06:06.564
If you don't mind,
I'd like to call my office.

01:06:06.565 --> 01:06:08.566
You got something good?

01:06:08.567 --> 01:06:11.736
An exclusive interview with
that janitor who was shot.

01:06:11.737 --> 01:06:14.531
If I were you, I wouldn't use this phone.
I'd go down the hall.

01:06:14.532 --> 01:06:15.657
Why?

01:06:15.658 --> 01:06:18.033
Because you're the only
legitimate newspaperman here.

01:06:18.034 --> 01:06:19.452
All these bums steal your stuff.

01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:23.339
Oh, let them. They don't have
my style. The Bensinger touch.

01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:27.002
Hold it!
Don't move.

01:06:27.003 --> 01:06:28.627
What's the matter?
Uh-huh, nose bleed.

01:06:28.628 --> 01:06:30.087
Put your head back.

01:06:30.088 --> 01:06:31.630
Oh, must be my blood pressure.

01:06:31.631 --> 01:06:33.425
Or menopause or something.
Hey, slick.

01:06:33.426 --> 01:06:35.135
He needs help.
Take him in there.

01:06:35.136 --> 01:06:36.678
There's a towel in my desk.

01:06:36.679 --> 01:06:38.972
Never mind. Put that ice
on the back of his neck.

01:06:38.973 --> 01:06:40.389
Oh, thank you, dear boy.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:43.476
Look, I'm pretending there ain't
no Earl Williams. So, goodbye.

01:06:43.477 --> 01:06:44.853
He's been seen where?

01:06:44.854 --> 01:06:47.147
Bullshit. I'm not going
on a wild goose chase.

01:06:47.148 --> 01:06:49.815
One more guy in Chicago with a gun,
who's gonna notice?

01:06:49.816 --> 01:06:52.651
Let's get back to work.
Deal the cards.

01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:53.987
Who pulled down the shades?

01:06:53.988 --> 01:06:55.112
Hildy.

01:06:55.113 --> 01:06:56.865
They were shooting
at the window again.

01:06:56.866 --> 01:06:58.450
I thought you had to catch a train.

01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:00.285
Yeah.
You were in such a goddamn hurry.

01:07:00.286 --> 01:07:01.535
Slight change of plans.

01:07:01.536 --> 01:07:02.787
I'm being picked up here.

01:07:02.788 --> 01:07:05.131
You know, fellas,

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:09.303
I got a whole different theory
about where Williams is.

01:07:10.253 --> 01:07:11.504
You do?

01:07:11.505 --> 01:07:12.671
I don't think

01:07:12.672 --> 01:07:14.840
he's in any of those places
they've been looking.

01:07:14.841 --> 01:07:16.343
Well, that's obvious.

01:07:16.344 --> 01:07:19.763
There's no way he could've gotten
out with all those guards around.

01:07:19.764 --> 01:07:21.222
What are you driving at?

01:07:21.223 --> 01:07:23.350
If he was coming
down the rain pipe,

01:07:23.351 --> 01:07:26.102
he could've climbed into any of
those windows along the way.

01:07:26.103 --> 01:07:28.063
My hunch is he's
somewhere in this building.

01:07:28.064 --> 01:07:29.773
Oh, sure.
He's hanging around

01:07:29.774 --> 01:07:31.232
like a duck in a shooting gallery.

01:07:31.233 --> 01:07:33.401
The mastermind at work.
Hawkshaw.

01:07:33.402 --> 01:07:35.861
What correspondence school
did you graduate from?

01:07:35.862 --> 01:07:37.948
All right.
All right.

01:07:37.949 --> 01:07:39.616
But maybe it isn't
all that meshuga.

01:07:39.617 --> 01:07:42.576
Maybe he climbed back into his
cell and is hiding under his bed.

01:07:42.577 --> 01:07:44.829
Yeah, maybe he's stashed
away in some filing cabinet

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:45.914
under "F" for fruitcake.

01:07:45.915 --> 01:07:47.499
He's probably waiting
until morning,

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.637
then he'll come tap dancing down the
stairs singing I Surrender Dear.

01:07:51.461 --> 01:07:53.964
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Maybe Schwartz has got something.

01:07:53.965 --> 01:07:55.382
We ought to search the building.

01:07:55.383 --> 01:07:56.757
Us? Search the building?

01:07:56.758 --> 01:07:57.842
Remember he's got a gun.

01:07:57.843 --> 01:07:58.927
Let the cops do it.

01:07:58.928 --> 01:08:01.096
Jesus. You got the story
right under your noses.

01:08:01.097 --> 01:08:03.974
Let's spread out. Everybody
take a floor. I'll cover for you.

01:08:03.975 --> 01:08:05.141
Oh, you will?
Sure.

01:08:05.142 --> 01:08:06.725
That's white of you.
Glad to do it.

01:08:06.726 --> 01:08:08.645
You wouldn't be trying
to throw us a curve?

01:08:08.646 --> 01:08:09.770
Where'd you get that idea?

01:08:09.771 --> 01:08:10.939
Something funny's going on.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.773
We found him and Mollie alone.

01:08:12.774 --> 01:08:14.359
Door locked and shades down.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.111
What the hell were you doing?

01:08:16.112 --> 01:08:17.821
What do you think we were doin'?

01:08:17.822 --> 01:08:19.913
Playing Parcheesi?

01:08:21.576 --> 01:08:23.243
Okay, fans, so now you know.

01:08:23.243 --> 01:08:25.120
Guy's entitled to have
a little fun, hmm?

01:08:25.121 --> 01:08:26.871
The night before you get married?

01:08:26.872 --> 01:08:28.037
Don't give us that crap.

01:08:28.038 --> 01:08:31.001
I don't know about you guys,
but with the sirens wailing,

01:08:31.002 --> 01:08:33.962
the bullets flying,
all hell breaking loose

01:08:33.962 --> 01:08:36.131
I find that sort of stimulating.

01:08:36.131 --> 01:08:37.881
Sexually, if you know what I mean.

01:08:37.883 --> 01:08:39.049
You and Mollie?

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.261
Come on.
You got better taste than that.

01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:44.189
Take that back,
or I'll belt you one.

01:08:45.932 --> 01:08:48.602
You weren't screwing Mollie.
You were trying to screw us.

01:08:48.603 --> 01:08:51.020
Like you did on that St.
Valentine's Day Massacre.

01:08:51.022 --> 01:08:52.897
Yeah.
Sending us to the wrong garage.

01:08:52.898 --> 01:08:54.398
You think we forgot that?

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:55.774
That's the business.
Dog eat dog.

01:08:55.776 --> 01:08:57.109
What're you trying to pull now?

01:08:57.109 --> 01:08:58.109
Me?
I've quit.

01:08:58.111 --> 01:08:59.779
One last stunt to
make us look stupid.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:01.031
That wouldn't be too hard.

01:09:01.032 --> 01:09:02.282
Give us the lowdown.

01:09:02.283 --> 01:09:03.783
You're on to something.

01:09:03.783 --> 01:09:05.618
You wouldn't hold out on your pals.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.912
You shan't scoop us this time.

01:09:06.912 --> 01:09:09.331
All right, fellas.
I was lyin'.

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:10.831
But I'm gonna level with you now.

01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:12.000
You better.

01:09:12.001 --> 01:09:14.376
The address of that garage
is 2122 North Clark Street.

01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:16.095
You miserable bastard!

01:09:17.298 --> 01:09:19.633
What are they doing to Mr. Johnson?

01:09:19.634 --> 01:09:21.216
What are they doing to my desk?

01:09:21.218 --> 01:09:22.770
Gentlemen, please.

01:09:25.473 --> 01:09:27.349
You won't get away with it, Hildy.

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:28.600
What about Williams?

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.421
Where is he?

01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:31.227
We'll kick your balls in.

01:09:31.228 --> 01:09:33.647
Leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything!

01:09:33.648 --> 01:09:34.773
Says who?

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:35.814
Says me!

01:09:35.816 --> 01:09:38.359
I'm the only one who knows
where Earl Williams is.

01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:40.120
Yeah?
Where?

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:43.907
Why should I tell you anything,
you lousy crumbs?

01:09:43.908 --> 01:09:46.076
Don't let her out.
Somebody close the door.

01:09:46.077 --> 01:09:47.202
You ain't going anywhere.

01:09:47.203 --> 01:09:48.328
Where is he?

01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:51.497
I never squealed on anybody in my
life, and I ain't squealing now.

01:09:51.499 --> 01:09:53.582
Come on, you tart,
or we'll slap it out of you.

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:56.168
We'll turn you over to the cops.
They'll make you talk.

01:09:56.169 --> 01:09:58.596
Get your hands off of me, you...

01:10:02.008 --> 01:10:03.300
Put that chair down.

01:10:03.301 --> 01:10:05.220
Somebody get behind her.
Oh, no, you don't.

01:10:05.221 --> 01:10:08.064
You just keep away from me,
you shit-heels!

01:10:08.975 --> 01:10:10.608
Let go of me, you...

01:10:11.936 --> 01:10:13.979
Six big guys ganging up on a girl.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.522
Let me know if you need any help.

01:10:15.523 --> 01:10:16.690
You stay out of it, Hildy.

01:10:16.691 --> 01:10:17.857
Somebody grab her.

01:10:17.858 --> 01:10:20.860
You try it and I'll break
your goddamn heads!

01:10:20.861 --> 01:10:23.572
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

01:10:23.573 --> 01:10:26.031
If you ask me, you're going
about this the wrong way.

01:10:26.032 --> 01:10:27.242
Well, who asked you?

01:10:27.243 --> 01:10:30.077
Mollie, if you have any
information, we'll pay you for it.

01:10:30.078 --> 01:10:31.538
Sure.
We'll all chip in.

01:10:31.539 --> 01:10:32.872
We'll give you $20.

01:10:32.873 --> 01:10:35.843
Yeah? I'm a whore, ain't I?
I'll do anything for money.

01:10:36.544 --> 01:10:37.626
We'll make it $50.

01:10:37.627 --> 01:10:39.546
You know how many
customers that is?

01:10:39.547 --> 01:10:41.380
Save a lot of wear and
tear on your ass.

01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:42.966
Why don't you all drop dead?

01:10:42.967 --> 01:10:44.301
All right, you slut...

01:10:44.302 --> 01:10:46.303
Want us to get rough with you?

01:10:46.304 --> 01:10:48.387
Take that chair away from her.

01:10:48.388 --> 01:10:50.858
Watch out for those goddamn heels.

01:10:51.684 --> 01:10:53.602
Oh, dear.
Must be my editor.

01:10:53.603 --> 01:10:55.227
You bitch!
Come on, talk.

01:10:55.228 --> 01:10:57.530
I'll see you in hell first.

01:11:01.277 --> 01:11:02.903
All right.

01:11:02.904 --> 01:11:05.538
You want to know where
Earl Williams is?

01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:09.834
I'll tell you where he is.

01:11:11.454 --> 01:11:13.546
Just follow me.

01:11:15.082 --> 01:11:16.549
Mollie!

01:11:16.918 --> 01:11:19.094
Jesus.

01:11:25.593 --> 01:11:26.760
Holy God.

01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.595
She's killed herself for sure.

01:11:28.596 --> 01:11:30.679
That's terrible.
You drove her to it.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.264
I never thought she'd do that.

01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:33.432
What'd you expect?

01:11:33.433 --> 01:11:35.477
All whores are a little goofy.

01:11:35.478 --> 01:11:37.144
Hey, she's not dead!

01:11:37.145 --> 01:11:39.648
Look, look.
She's moving.

01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:40.941
Come on, let's go.

01:11:40.942 --> 01:11:42.450
What a story.

01:11:42.944 --> 01:11:45.663
Shady lady leaps for love!

01:11:52.536 --> 01:11:55.422
Walter, did you see that?
She jumped.

01:11:57.792 --> 01:11:59.260
Yeah.

01:12:02.045 --> 01:12:03.763
Where is he?

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:05.257
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:12:05.258 --> 01:12:09.436
Come on, come on. There's no time
for that. Where have you got Williams?

01:12:10.137 --> 01:12:11.814
Pull those shades.

01:12:12.682 --> 01:12:15.141
Hi, Earl. How you doing?
Don't worry, I'm your friend.

01:12:15.142 --> 01:12:16.434
Where's Mollie?
What happened?

01:12:16.435 --> 01:12:17.936
What did they do to her?

01:12:17.937 --> 01:12:19.646
She's gonna be all right.

01:12:19.647 --> 01:12:21.480
Let me out!
I can't stand it!

01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:24.451
Just stay where you are.
You're sitting pretty.

01:12:24.652 --> 01:12:27.288
Now, then, let's get organized.

01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:31.125
Hello. Burns here,
get me Duffy.

01:12:32.118 --> 01:12:33.994
I don't hear that
typewriter, Hildy.

01:12:33.995 --> 01:12:35.494
Get your ass over there.

01:12:35.495 --> 01:12:37.922
I want some of that old
Johnson word magic.

01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:39.958
What're you waiting for?

01:12:39.959 --> 01:12:43.253
I'm waiting for my girl, that's what I'm
waitin' for. She's gonna pick me up.

01:12:43.254 --> 01:12:46.380
Your girl? What are you,
some puking college boy?

01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:48.924
This is the hottest story
since the Chicago fire!

01:12:48.925 --> 01:12:51.136
We'll make monkeys out
of all the other papers.

01:12:51.137 --> 01:12:53.138
We'll kick City Hall
over like an applecart.

01:12:53.139 --> 01:12:54.221
Expose the bastards, huh?

01:12:54.222 --> 01:12:56.223
Expose them?
We'll crucify 'em!

01:12:56.224 --> 01:12:57.851
You and I will be
running this town.

01:12:57.852 --> 01:12:59.436
They'll be naming streets after us.

01:12:59.437 --> 01:13:01.563
Johnson Street.
Burns Boulevard.

01:13:01.564 --> 01:13:04.482
How come you're a boulevard,
I'm only a street?

01:13:04.483 --> 01:13:07.077
Duffy?
Where the hell is Duffy?

01:13:07.904 --> 01:13:09.954
Somebody answer me!

01:13:10.947 --> 01:13:12.114
Y-Y-Yes?

01:13:12.115 --> 01:13:15.502
Get your head back in there,
you goddamn turtle.

01:13:17.622 --> 01:13:18.954
Quit stalling, Hildy.

01:13:18.955 --> 01:13:20.831
Get that machine and tear into it.

01:13:20.832 --> 01:13:24.010
Now, listen, Earl,
when I rap three times,

01:13:24.921 --> 01:13:28.057
that means the coast is clear.
Understand?

01:13:29.382 --> 01:13:30.935
Attaboy.

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:33.303
How long do you think
you can hide him in there?

01:13:33.304 --> 01:13:35.931
No problem. We take him to the
Examiner, keep him under wraps

01:13:35.932 --> 01:13:37.681
until we can break
the story exclusive.

01:13:37.682 --> 01:13:40.477
How're you gonna get him outta here?
The cops will see him.

01:13:40.478 --> 01:13:41.895
Not if he's inside the desk.

01:13:41.896 --> 01:13:43.562
You're gonna move the whole desk?
How?

01:13:43.563 --> 01:13:46.242
We'll lower it out of the
window if necessary.

01:13:47.068 --> 01:13:48.401
Duffy?

01:13:48.402 --> 01:13:50.861
Duffy!
Where the hell have you been?

01:13:50.862 --> 01:13:53.198
Screw your diabetes.
Here's what I want you to do.

01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:55.492
Send over one of our
delivery trucks right away

01:13:55.493 --> 01:13:57.077
with six gorillas from circulation.

01:13:57.078 --> 01:13:58.994
And tell them to bring
a block and tackle.

01:13:58.995 --> 01:14:00.372
Who is it?

01:14:00.373 --> 01:14:02.289
Rudy Keppler.
Examiner.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:03.676
Piss and vinegar.

01:14:04.584 --> 01:14:07.930
Duffy, keep this line open.
Don't you leave the phone again.

01:14:11.926 --> 01:14:14.970
It's a miracle. She only has a
concussion and a broken leg.

01:14:14.971 --> 01:14:16.011
Thank God.

01:14:16.012 --> 01:14:17.514
She's going to Passavant Hospital.

01:14:17.515 --> 01:14:19.598
All the reporters have gone.
Should I go, too?

01:14:19.599 --> 01:14:20.976
No, we need you here.

01:14:20.977 --> 01:14:22.309
Oh, hello,
Mr. Burns.

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.436
You got that camera?

01:14:23.437 --> 01:14:24.521
Yes, sir, right here.

01:14:24.522 --> 01:14:25.604
Let's have it.

01:14:25.605 --> 01:14:26.906
Yes, sir.

01:14:31.737 --> 01:14:33.822
Earl, I need a picture of you.

01:14:33.823 --> 01:14:35.740
Uh, I don't have one on me.

01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:36.992
Oh, we're gonna take it now.

01:14:36.993 --> 01:14:40.035
It's for the Examiner tomorrow.
Front page. Huh?

01:14:40.036 --> 01:14:41.288
Oh, really?

01:14:41.289 --> 01:14:42.548
Hey.

01:14:42.957 --> 01:14:44.124
You know who that is?

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:46.459
Oh, shut up.
And let's have your collar, too.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.460
My collar?

01:14:47.461 --> 01:14:49.471
It's celluloid, isn't it?

01:14:51.173 --> 01:14:52.433
Ha.

01:14:58.556 --> 01:15:00.931
I'm calling the Sheriff a hyena.
What do you like with it?

01:15:00.932 --> 01:15:03.517
Vile, corrupt,
unscrupulous, depraved?

01:15:03.518 --> 01:15:05.478
Yeah.
And in that order.

01:15:05.479 --> 01:15:07.731
He can sue the paper
for a million dollars.

01:15:07.732 --> 01:15:10.357
Let him.
We'll take it out of your salary.

01:15:10.358 --> 01:15:14.029
Here. When I say "now,"
drop this in there.

01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:15.155
Got it?

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:17.458
All right, Earl. Ready?

01:15:19.577 --> 01:15:20.911
No, Earl.
No smile.

01:15:20.912 --> 01:15:22.495
Give me that hunted look.

01:15:22.496 --> 01:15:24.623
Cowering, fearful of every sound,

01:15:24.624 --> 01:15:27.593
of every footstep,
like an animal at bay.

01:15:28.002 --> 01:15:29.511
Hold it.

01:15:31.172 --> 01:15:32.555
Now!

01:15:33.507 --> 01:15:35.141
That's it.

01:15:36.676 --> 01:15:38.844
Take this over to the paper,
develop it immediately.

01:15:38.845 --> 01:15:41.607
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Mr. Williams.

01:15:42.432 --> 01:15:43.600
How're we coming?

01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:44.902
Beat it.

01:15:47.521 --> 01:15:49.022
What are you gonna do with me now?

01:15:49.023 --> 01:15:50.740
Just trust me.

01:15:53.903 --> 01:15:55.277
Duffy, listen.

01:15:55.278 --> 01:15:57.154
We're gonna rip out
the whole front page.

01:15:57.155 --> 01:15:58.864
The kid's on his way
with a photograph.

01:15:58.865 --> 01:16:00.032
Wait till you see it.

01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:01.867
Hildy's knocking out the story now.

01:16:01.868 --> 01:16:03.712
Yes, I said Hildy.

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:14.713
He said he'd be waiting.

01:16:14.714 --> 01:16:16.091
You want me to get him?

01:16:16.092 --> 01:16:19.310
Would you, please?
Third floor, pressroom.

01:16:19.387 --> 01:16:22.430
A newspaperman?
Don't tell me.

01:16:22.431 --> 01:16:24.849
Those guys, you pick
them up late at night,

01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:27.727
they pass out in the cab.
You schlep them upstairs,

01:16:27.728 --> 01:16:29.729
you undress them, you
put them to bed.

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:31.856
When you go through their
pockets for the fare,

01:16:31.857 --> 01:16:33.774
they start yelling for the cops.

01:16:33.775 --> 01:16:35.694
I schenk you newspapermen.

01:16:35.695 --> 01:16:38.122
Never mind.
I'll go myself.

01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:46.538
To hell with the
Nicaraguan earthquake.

01:16:46.539 --> 01:16:49.133
I don't care if
there's 100,000 dead.

01:16:49.332 --> 01:16:51.459
The League of Nations?
Spike it.

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.254
No, no, no. Don't touch Cdr.
Byrd and the penguins,

01:16:54.255 --> 01:16:55.629
that's human interest.

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:58.842
Can I mention the Mayor's half
interest in that Chinese whorehouse?

01:16:58.843 --> 01:17:01.927
Pour it on, kiddo.
Below the belt, every punch.

01:17:01.928 --> 01:17:05.265
Duffy, has that delivery truck left
yet with the block and tackle?

01:17:05.266 --> 01:17:08.651
Well, goose them up. God damn
it, every minute counts!

01:17:10.021 --> 01:17:11.322
Hildy.

01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:14.366
Hildy.

01:17:15.358 --> 01:17:17.611
Jesus!
People walk in and out of here

01:17:17.612 --> 01:17:20.039
like it was a Greyhound terminal.

01:17:21.364 --> 01:17:23.491
Uh, Peggy, I thought you
were picking up the bags.

01:17:23.492 --> 01:17:25.117
I did.
They're downstairs in the cab.

01:17:25.118 --> 01:17:27.703
Oh, yeah? Well, we got plenty of time.
Sit down, honey.

01:17:27.704 --> 01:17:28.954
The Hoover speech?

01:17:28.955 --> 01:17:31.832
Shove it between the want
ads and the obituaries.

01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:35.127
Oh, this is the greatest thing that
ever happened to me in my life.

01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:36.755
Oh, I thought I was.

01:17:36.756 --> 01:17:39.391
I didn't mean it that way,
honey. Honey...

01:17:40.801 --> 01:17:42.551
What is this, The Student Prince?

01:17:42.552 --> 01:17:44.136
We're working against a deadline.

01:17:44.137 --> 01:17:45.639
So are we.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.098
Let's hear what you got.

01:17:47.099 --> 01:17:50.185
"While hundreds of Sheriff Hartman's
paid gunmen stalked through Chicago

01:17:50.186 --> 01:17:51.645
"shooting innocent bystanders,

01:17:51.646 --> 01:17:53.104
"spreading their reign of terror,

01:17:53.105 --> 01:17:55.856
Earl Williams was lurking less than
200 feet from the Sheriff's..."

01:17:55.857 --> 01:17:57.943
Hold it! Aren't you gonna
mention the Examiner?

01:17:57.944 --> 01:17:59.027
Don't we take any credit?

01:17:59.028 --> 01:18:00.277
It's in the second paragraph.

01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:02.364
Who the hell's gonna read
the second paragraph?

01:18:02.365 --> 01:18:05.157
For 15 years I've been trying to
teach you how to write a lead.

01:18:05.158 --> 01:18:06.700
Do I have to do everything myself?

01:18:06.701 --> 01:18:08.035
Get the story?
Write it?

01:18:08.036 --> 01:18:10.746
Listen, saphead, I can blow
a better story out of my...

01:18:10.747 --> 01:18:12.249
My nose than you can write.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.960
Goddamn dilettante. Maybe
Philadelphia's where you belong,

01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:16.920
making up jingles for Burma-shave.

01:18:16.921 --> 01:18:20.507
Oh, really? Well, who wrote the deathbed
confession of "Three-Finger" Banducci?

01:18:20.508 --> 01:18:22.174
Who wrote Roxie Hart's diary, huh?

01:18:22.175 --> 01:18:23.677
What... what about
the Dayton flood?

01:18:23.678 --> 01:18:25.345
Even the telegraph
operator was crying.

01:18:25.346 --> 01:18:26.887
All right, make me cry now.

01:18:26.888 --> 01:18:28.515
Someday you're gonna
do that, Walter,

01:18:28.516 --> 01:18:30.350
and I'm gonna sock you
right in the schnoz.

01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:32.519
You're beautiful when you're angry.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.155
Duffy.
Duffy?

01:18:36.022 --> 01:18:37.533
Duffy!

01:18:37.858 --> 01:18:40.995
That's what I get for hiring
somebody with a disease.

01:18:41.988 --> 01:18:45.206
I'm beginning to think all
newspapermen have a disease.

01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:59.220
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Now the moon is out.

01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:06.352
This the sort of thing
you had in mind?

01:19:07.847 --> 01:19:09.388
"The Chicago Examiner once again

01:19:09.389 --> 01:19:11.308
"rode to the rescue of
the city last night

01:19:11.309 --> 01:19:12.892
"in the darkest hour
of her history.

01:19:12.893 --> 01:19:14.853
"Earl Williams, the Bolshevik tiger

01:19:14.854 --> 01:19:16.605
"who leaped snarling
from the gallows

01:19:16.606 --> 01:19:18.440
"onto the flanks of
the unsuspecting city

01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:20.232
was captured by..."
Now you're cooking!

01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:22.193
How many words?
Give me everything you got.

01:19:22.194 --> 01:19:24.236
Because, with this, you're
stepping into a new class.

01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:26.706
Heywood Bruin.
H. I. Mencken.

01:19:30.578 --> 01:19:32.796
Grafters and gangsters.

01:19:33.748 --> 01:19:37.416
Sin City: Blood in the gutters.

01:19:37.417 --> 01:19:38.928
A rhapsody in red.

01:19:39.754 --> 01:19:41.630
Red.
That's what we'll do.

01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:43.089
The headline in red ink.

01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:44.466
180 point type?

01:19:44.467 --> 01:19:46.518
180 nothing, 360.

01:19:46.594 --> 01:19:49.521
It's like Lindbergh
landing in Paris.

01:19:58.314 --> 01:20:00.074
Cigarette me.

01:20:26.883 --> 01:20:29.511
Hildy, you don't really want
to give this up, do you?

01:20:29.512 --> 01:20:30.679
Deep down...

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.732
Honey, please, not now.
I-I'm going good.

01:20:41.566 --> 01:20:43.233
Darling, where are the tickets?

01:20:43.234 --> 01:20:45.326
Uh, right in there.

01:20:48.656 --> 01:20:51.449
I'm taking mine.
There's no use my sticking around.

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.286
All righty. Go on down to the station.
Check the bags in.

01:20:54.287 --> 01:20:57.006
I-I'll get there. Don't you worry.

01:20:57.665 --> 01:20:59.550
Goodbye, Hildy.

01:21:00.251 --> 01:21:01.801
See you.

01:21:09.217 --> 01:21:12.344
I hope he saved the sales
slip for the wedding rings.

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:15.441
No big deal.
They'll make nice cufflinks.

01:21:31.908 --> 01:21:33.751
Got enough air?

01:21:38.164 --> 01:21:40.749
Duffy? That kid show
up yet with the photo?

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.043
Well, I want it made up
into a four-column cut.

01:21:43.044 --> 01:21:45.429
Tell Max in circulation,
we're going for a million.

01:21:48.049 --> 01:21:50.266
Hey, open up in there.

01:21:50.842 --> 01:21:51.885
Oh, shit!

01:21:51.886 --> 01:21:53.011
Who's that?

01:21:53.012 --> 01:21:55.721
Bensinger. Tribune.
That's his desk.

01:21:55.722 --> 01:21:57.973
I'll handle this.
What did you say his name was?

01:21:57.974 --> 01:21:59.442
Bensinger.

01:22:01.103 --> 01:22:03.188
Kind of exclusive
aren't you, Johnson?

01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:04.563
Hello, Bensinger.

01:22:04.564 --> 01:22:06.367
Oh, Mr. Burns.

01:22:06.609 --> 01:22:09.194
It's quite an honor
having you here.

01:22:09.195 --> 01:22:10.487
You know my name?

01:22:10.488 --> 01:22:11.905
Do I know his name?

01:22:11.906 --> 01:22:14.074
Hildy and I were just
talking about you.

01:22:14.075 --> 01:22:16.867
That was one swell story you had
in the Tribune this morning.

01:22:16.868 --> 01:22:19.745
Oh, thank you, Mr. Burns.
Did you care for the poem?

01:22:19.746 --> 01:22:21.997
The poem?
That's what made it.

01:22:21.998 --> 01:22:24.084
I'm rather proud of the ending:

01:22:24.085 --> 01:22:28.754
"And all is well outside his
cell "But in his heart he hears

01:22:28.755 --> 01:22:31.465
"The hangman calling
And the gallows falling

01:22:31.466 --> 01:22:34.395
And his white-haired
mother's tears"

01:22:37.472 --> 01:22:39.149
A classic.

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:42.017
Bensinger, how would you
like to work for me?

01:22:42.018 --> 01:22:43.103
You mean that, Mr. Burns?

01:22:43.104 --> 01:22:45.146
I'm not just whistling Dixie.

01:22:45.147 --> 01:22:47.399
Duffy, I'm sending
Bensinger over to see you.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.607
Marvin, isn't it?

01:22:48.608 --> 01:22:50.277
Oh, no, no.
Roy. Roy V.

01:22:50.278 --> 01:22:53.280
You sure? Roy Bensinger, the poet.

01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:54.613
Put him right on the staff.

01:22:54.614 --> 01:22:56.198
How much you getting
at the Tribune?

01:22:56.199 --> 01:22:57.366
$75.

01:22:57.367 --> 01:22:59.919
Give him $100 and a by-line.

01:23:00.246 --> 01:23:02.998
Is that truck on the way over yet?
Good.

01:23:02.999 --> 01:23:05.207
They're coming to pick up your desk.
My desk?

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:08.377
Ah, you shouldn't be working a police
beat. I want you right at my elbow.

01:23:08.378 --> 01:23:10.504
Now, get over to the office
and report to Duffy.

01:23:10.505 --> 01:23:11.715
You mean, right now?

01:23:11.716 --> 01:23:13.883
Oh, I couldn't quit the
Tribune just like that.

01:23:13.884 --> 01:23:15.217
It wouldn't be ethical.

01:23:15.218 --> 01:23:17.304
You don't owe them a damn thing.

01:23:17.305 --> 01:23:19.472
Well, they have been
treating me rather shabbily.

01:23:19.473 --> 01:23:22.267
The way they edit my copy.
They just butcher it.

01:23:22.268 --> 01:23:25.446
On the Examiner,
your copy will be sacred.

01:23:27.899 --> 01:23:29.742
Sacred.
Sacred.

01:23:30.151 --> 01:23:32.027
Roy, here's your first assignment.

01:23:32.028 --> 01:23:34.905
I want you to make up a prayer
for the city of Chicago.

01:23:34.906 --> 01:23:36.947
We'll carry it on
the editorial page.

01:23:36.948 --> 01:23:39.326
"Our Father, who art in Heaven,

01:23:39.327 --> 01:23:43.662
last year there were 421
unsolved murders..."

01:23:43.663 --> 01:23:45.165
All set up in boldface Gothic.

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:47.083
Okay. I'll just get my
rhyming dictionary.

01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:49.336
It doesn't have to rhyme.

01:23:49.337 --> 01:23:53.214
Just give me the Goddamndest
prayer anybody ever heard.

01:23:53.215 --> 01:23:55.091
You want it Old Testament
or New Testament?

01:23:55.092 --> 01:23:58.511
Let's have it between the Sermon
on the Mount and the 23rd Psalm.

01:23:58.512 --> 01:24:00.688
That's easy.

01:24:03.935 --> 01:24:06.977
Duffy, that Tribune sneak
is on the way over.

01:24:06.978 --> 01:24:08.021
Yeah, Bensinger.

01:24:08.022 --> 01:24:10.731
Wait till he hands in his copy,
then tell him his prayer stinks,

01:24:10.732 --> 01:24:13.576
and kick him down the stairs.

01:24:14.027 --> 01:24:17.665
"His white-haired mother's
tears," for Christ's sake.

01:24:19.699 --> 01:24:21.785
Where do you want
these, Mr. Johnson?

01:24:21.786 --> 01:24:23.078
Any place.

01:24:23.079 --> 01:24:24.621
The lady said...
All right.

01:24:24.622 --> 01:24:26.623
Those are my bags.
What are they doing here?

01:24:26.624 --> 01:24:28.874
The lady sent them up.
Peggy?

01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:29.960
Oh, I don't know her name,

01:24:29.961 --> 01:24:32.254
but she sure was crying
when that taxi drove off.

01:24:32.255 --> 01:24:33.295
Okay.
Okay.

01:24:33.296 --> 01:24:34.547
Crying? What did I do wrong?

01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:37.299
Nothing.
Those were tears of happiness.

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.511
She had a narrow
escape and so did you.

01:24:39.512 --> 01:24:41.178
Well, I don't want to escape.

01:24:41.179 --> 01:24:42.931
I'm nuts about her.
I want to marry her.

01:24:42.932 --> 01:24:45.517
But I wouldn't expect you to
understand a thing like that.

01:24:45.518 --> 01:24:47.227
Don't tell me about women.

01:24:47.228 --> 01:24:49.770
That dame in Waukegan
chopped up her husband

01:24:49.771 --> 01:24:51.940
and flushed him down the
drain on their honeymoon.

01:24:51.941 --> 01:24:53.567
He was nuts about her, too.

01:24:53.568 --> 01:24:54.900
And that Mrs. Haggerty.

01:24:54.901 --> 01:24:58.154
Knocked off six husbands by sprinkling
arsenic on their prune whip.

01:24:58.155 --> 01:24:59.780
That's marriage for you.

01:24:59.781 --> 01:25:01.992
You think you got it made?

01:25:01.993 --> 01:25:03.994
No home, no family, no friends.

01:25:03.995 --> 01:25:05.745
Eating cold beans outta tin cans,

01:25:05.746 --> 01:25:08.080
sleepin' on your office
couch five nights a week.

01:25:08.081 --> 01:25:11.041
The only time you ever get it up
is when you put the paper to bed.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:12.544
All right, you've had a nice rest.

01:25:12.545 --> 01:25:14.963
Now put down that fairy
wand and get back to work.

01:25:14.964 --> 01:25:16.131
Goodbye, Walter.

01:25:16.132 --> 01:25:17.757
Hildy, this is desertion.

01:25:17.758 --> 01:25:20.050
If you were in the Army, you
could be shot for this.

01:25:20.051 --> 01:25:21.729
Get out of my way!

01:25:22.763 --> 01:25:25.724
Not so fast, Johnson.
Where do you think you're going?

01:25:25.725 --> 01:25:27.851
To the station, to meet my fiancee.

01:25:27.852 --> 01:25:30.312
Your fiancee, huh?
What's her name, Earl Williams?

01:25:30.313 --> 01:25:31.479
Earl Williams?
You're crazy.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.564
Hang onto him.

01:25:32.565 --> 01:25:33.814
He and Mollie are in cahoots.

01:25:33.815 --> 01:25:35.066
Now his boss shows up.

01:25:35.067 --> 01:25:36.776
There's something
fishy going on here.

01:25:36.777 --> 01:25:39.613
Okay, Johnson.
What are you two cooking up?

01:25:39.614 --> 01:25:42.616
Hartman, you've got any questions,

01:25:42.617 --> 01:25:44.667
address them directly to me.

01:25:44.994 --> 01:25:48.288
All right, Burns.
What are you doing here?

01:25:48.289 --> 01:25:51.540
None of your goddamn business.

01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:53.417
Ever hear of the First Amendment?

01:25:53.418 --> 01:25:57.005
Guarantees freedom of the
press and the pressroom.

01:25:57.006 --> 01:25:59.225
I must ask you to leave.

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.300
You what?

01:26:00.301 --> 01:26:01.801
Or I'll have you arrested.

01:26:01.802 --> 01:26:02.968
Don't let him bluff you.

01:26:02.969 --> 01:26:04.054
Show him who's in charge.

01:26:04.055 --> 01:26:05.805
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm in charge here.

01:26:05.806 --> 01:26:08.308
I don't care what kind of a
hotshot editor you are, Burns,

01:26:08.309 --> 01:26:10.142
I can have you barred
from this building.

01:26:10.143 --> 01:26:11.268
That's right.
You can.

01:26:11.269 --> 01:26:13.270
Why don't you throw us out?
Both of us.

01:26:13.271 --> 01:26:16.816
Oh, no. Nobody's leaving until
I get to the bottom of this.

01:26:16.817 --> 01:26:19.945
Will you give me a break?
My girl's gonna leave without me.

01:26:19.946 --> 01:26:21.947
Now let go of me, God damn it.

01:26:21.948 --> 01:26:25.084
Watch out. Watch out,
he's got a gun.

01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:27.118
I'll take it.

01:26:27.119 --> 01:26:29.829
Hopalong Johnson.
The Drugstore Cowboy.

01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:30.956
Where'd you get this?

01:26:30.957 --> 01:26:32.998
I got a right to carry
a gun if I want to.

01:26:32.999 --> 01:26:34.458
Not this gun.

01:26:34.459 --> 01:26:36.001
I can explain that.

01:26:36.002 --> 01:26:38.505
He was doing a piece
on the Abadaba gang,

01:26:38.506 --> 01:26:40.464
and I gave it to him
for self-protection.

01:26:40.465 --> 01:26:43.717
Oh, yeah?
That's very interesting.

01:26:43.718 --> 01:26:45.136
This happens to be the gun

01:26:45.137 --> 01:26:47.179
that Earl Williams
shot his way out with.

01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.349
Are you trying to
make me out a liar?

01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:51.944
I know my own gun when I see it!

01:26:56.022 --> 01:26:57.356
Your gun?
So that's it.

01:26:57.357 --> 01:26:59.191
I knew something stunk here.
How come?

01:26:59.192 --> 01:27:01.193
What's the story?
Never mind that.

01:27:01.194 --> 01:27:03.530
Where's Earl Williams.
Where have you got him?

01:27:03.531 --> 01:27:06.575
Are you implying that the Examiner
would aid and abet a criminal?

01:27:06.576 --> 01:27:08.285
You're darn tootin'.

01:27:08.286 --> 01:27:10.745
Don't you know what it
says on our masthead,

01:27:10.746 --> 01:27:12.496
right under the eagle?

01:27:12.497 --> 01:27:15.166
"The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."

01:27:15.167 --> 01:27:16.375
Don't listen to that.

01:27:16.376 --> 01:27:17.711
They're playin' us for suckers.

01:27:17.712 --> 01:27:18.837
Give them the third degree.

01:27:18.838 --> 01:27:21.015
Leave it to me, boys.

01:27:21.882 --> 01:27:25.801
Johnson, if you're in such a goddamn
hurry, I'll make you a deal.

01:27:25.802 --> 01:27:28.430
You tell me where Williams
is and I'll let you go.

01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:29.513
Okay, it's a deal.

01:27:29.514 --> 01:27:30.514
Where is he?

01:27:30.515 --> 01:27:32.559
He went to the hospital
to see Dr. Eggelhofer.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.351
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.

01:27:34.352 --> 01:27:36.237
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:27:37.064 --> 01:27:38.698
Wise guy.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.902
Hartman, you're a
disgrace to your badge.

01:27:41.903 --> 01:27:43.235
There's a killer on the loose,

01:27:43.236 --> 01:27:45.164
and you're harassing
innocent citizens.

01:27:46.032 --> 01:27:47.707
Excuse me.

01:27:48.492 --> 01:27:50.543
Don't touch that!

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:52.670
I'll answer it.

01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:55.457
It may be Earl Williams.

01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:57.927
I'll lay you 6-to-5 on that.

01:27:58.336 --> 01:28:00.553
Hello?
Who?

01:28:01.505 --> 01:28:03.924
Yes, this is Walter Burns.

01:28:03.925 --> 01:28:06.801
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Burns,
but I have some bad news.

01:28:06.802 --> 01:28:09.471
The photograph,
I'm afraid it didn't come out.

01:28:09.472 --> 01:28:12.066
Maybe the film was a little damp.

01:28:12.099 --> 01:28:14.025
What photograph?

01:28:14.267 --> 01:28:16.195
Of Earl Williams?

01:28:16.728 --> 01:28:18.531
The one I took?

01:28:18.606 --> 01:28:19.940
Where?

01:28:19.941 --> 01:28:22.317
God damn it, don't
tell me I should know.

01:28:22.318 --> 01:28:24.370
Just remind me.

01:28:26.696 --> 01:28:28.073
That does it, Burns.

01:28:28.074 --> 01:28:30.617
It's against the law to
impersonate a managing editor.

01:28:30.618 --> 01:28:32.786
I'll give you 10 seconds to
hand over Earl Williams.

01:28:32.787 --> 01:28:34.120
You can't even count to 10.

01:28:34.121 --> 01:28:35.330
Damn it!

01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:37.716
I know he's around here someplace.

01:28:39.543 --> 01:28:41.052
Aha!

01:28:44.172 --> 01:28:45.382
Where did this come from?

01:28:45.383 --> 01:28:46.508
How the hell would I know?

01:28:46.509 --> 01:28:48.093
Does it belong to Earl Williams?

01:28:48.094 --> 01:28:49.970
Why don't you put an
ad in the classifieds?

01:28:49.971 --> 01:28:52.439
Maybe he'll come
around to claim it.

01:28:52.597 --> 01:28:54.849
By God!
I'll find him,

01:28:54.850 --> 01:28:58.361
if I have to tear this place
apart brick by brick.

01:29:10.992 --> 01:29:13.743
Hi, Mr. Burns, we
got the truck here.

01:29:13.744 --> 01:29:15.494
Not now, Butch.
Go away.

01:29:15.495 --> 01:29:17.298
Wait a minute.

01:29:17.456 --> 01:29:19.039
What are you fellas here for?

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.041
We're supposed to
pick up somethin'.

01:29:21.042 --> 01:29:22.261
Is that so?

01:29:23.004 --> 01:29:24.754
Well, now we're getting someplace.

01:29:24.755 --> 01:29:27.339
What were you supposed to pick up?

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:30.269
I don't know.
Mr. Burns was gonna tell us.

01:29:31.636 --> 01:29:35.398
All right, Mr. Burns.
Go ahead, tell him.

01:29:35.683 --> 01:29:40.244
Sure. Boys, take those two suitcases
down to the truck and wait for me.

01:29:40.645 --> 01:29:42.396
Here you are, fellas.

01:29:42.397 --> 01:29:44.190
Who are you kiddin', Burns?

01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:47.152
Five guys and a truck to
pick up two suitcases?

01:29:47.153 --> 01:29:49.788
Go fight the Teamsters' Union.

01:29:49.946 --> 01:29:52.415
Forget it, Moe! We won't need it.

01:29:56.536 --> 01:30:00.332
God damn it to hell. I want to
know what's going on around here,

01:30:00.333 --> 01:30:03.001
if I have to beat it out
of you with a rubber hose!

01:30:03.002 --> 01:30:06.305
Hartman, you're through.
You're all washed up.

01:30:06.797 --> 01:30:07.797
Who says so?

01:30:07.798 --> 01:30:08.798
The voters.

01:30:08.799 --> 01:30:12.259
Come Tuesday, they're gonna kick
you out on your big fat can.

01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.387
You'll be sellin' pencils at
the corner of State and Lake

01:30:15.388 --> 01:30:18.149
if you can get a permit
from the new sheriff.

01:30:18.433 --> 01:30:21.152
Why is everybody ganging up on me?

01:30:21.187 --> 01:30:23.188
The Mayor wants to take
me off the ticket.

01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:25.106
My wife isn't speaking to me.

01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:27.400
I got a gallows out
there going to waste.

01:30:27.401 --> 01:30:29.402
I haven't eaten a thing all day.

01:30:29.403 --> 01:30:30.904
It's just not fair.

01:30:30.905 --> 01:30:34.115
Please. Please tell me
where Earl Williams is.

01:30:34.116 --> 01:30:36.952
I'm the law. You gotta
have a little respect.

01:30:36.953 --> 01:30:38.577
Pull yourself together, Hartman.

01:30:38.578 --> 01:30:39.788
Don't you understand?

01:30:39.789 --> 01:30:41.455
The Bolsheviks are everywhere!

01:30:41.456 --> 01:30:43.083
They're taking over!

01:30:43.084 --> 01:30:45.459
They're coming out of
the sewers like rats.

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.294
Climbing up our flagpole

01:30:47.295 --> 01:30:51.307
and gnawing away at our
Stars and Stripes!

01:30:52.218 --> 01:30:53.717
Better get him a straightjacket.

01:30:53.718 --> 01:30:55.563
What'd you say?

01:30:55.846 --> 01:30:57.721
You ought to be put away, Hartman,

01:30:57.722 --> 01:31:00.191
'cause you're sick, sick, sick.

01:31:01.102 --> 01:31:02.893
You'll be sorry when I'm gone.

01:31:02.894 --> 01:31:05.363
And you won't have anybody
to kick around anymore.

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:07.983
What's that?

01:31:07.984 --> 01:31:08.942
What's what?

01:31:08.943 --> 01:31:10.110
Holy God!
He's in there.

01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:11.152
It's Williams.

01:31:11.153 --> 01:31:12.279
He's in the desk.

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:15.407
Stand back, everybody!
Get your guns!

01:31:15.408 --> 01:31:16.866
Dumb commie schmuck.

01:31:16.867 --> 01:31:18.743
City desk.
Don't take any chances.

01:31:18.744 --> 01:31:19.785
Hurry it up.

01:31:19.786 --> 01:31:21.162
We're dealing with a wild animal.

01:31:21.163 --> 01:31:22.455
Shoot right through the desk!

01:31:22.456 --> 01:31:24.749
For God's sake, he's harmless.
You've got his gun.

01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:26.126
Aim right at the center!

01:31:26.127 --> 01:31:27.334
That's cold-blooded murder.

01:31:27.335 --> 01:31:30.337
Pete, I'm warning you.
There's witnesses here.

01:31:30.338 --> 01:31:32.214
Williams, we got you covered.

01:31:32.215 --> 01:31:34.009
I'm gonna count to three.

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:37.262
Open up or we'll blast you!
One...

01:31:37.263 --> 01:31:38.929
Stand by.
Any second now.

01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:40.347
Two... Hold on.

01:31:40.348 --> 01:31:41.600
Coming right up.

01:31:41.601 --> 01:31:43.109
Three!

01:31:52.153 --> 01:31:55.071
All right, Williams.
No funny business.

01:31:55.072 --> 01:31:57.041
Just come on out.

01:32:01.244 --> 01:32:04.039
I can't. I can't.
My legs are asleep.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.624
Grab him, boys!

01:32:05.625 --> 01:32:07.666
Hey, hey, easy.
Easy, now.

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:10.754
Earl Williams was captured in
the Criminal Courts Building

01:32:10.755 --> 01:32:11.837
hiding in a desk.

01:32:11.838 --> 01:32:14.507
He put up a desperate struggle,
but he was overpowered.

01:32:14.508 --> 01:32:17.010
He tried to shoot it out with
the cops, but his gun jammed.

01:32:17.011 --> 01:32:19.095
Williams was betrayed
by an old sweetheart,

01:32:19.096 --> 01:32:21.348
who then attempted suicide.

01:32:21.349 --> 01:32:23.475
Duffy, take this down.
The Examiner,

01:32:23.476 --> 01:32:25.518
guardian and conscience of Chicago

01:32:25.519 --> 01:32:28.020
having single-handedly
captured Earl Williams

01:32:28.021 --> 01:32:31.574
has just handed him over to
Sheriff what's-his-name.

01:32:35.613 --> 01:32:38.864
Now then, the hanging
will go on as scheduled,

01:32:38.865 --> 01:32:41.033
7:00 a.m. Sharp.

01:32:41.034 --> 01:32:43.128
Take him away, boys.

01:32:43.204 --> 01:32:44.412
Goodbye, Earl.

01:32:44.413 --> 01:32:45.579
Tell Mollie not to cry.

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.917
Those 13 steps, they don't
lead up to the gallows.

01:32:48.918 --> 01:32:51.010
They lead up to the stars.

01:32:55.341 --> 01:32:57.550
That's it, Hildy!

01:32:57.551 --> 01:32:59.718
Not to the gallows,
but up to the stars.

01:32:59.719 --> 01:33:01.720
There's your last words.

01:33:01.721 --> 01:33:04.391
And on the front page, we'll
have a composite picture.

01:33:04.392 --> 01:33:07.811
The stars, the steps, and at the
top of the steps, Marx and Lenin

01:33:07.812 --> 01:33:10.272
waiting for Earl Williams.
How's that?

01:33:10.273 --> 01:33:11.991
Just dandy.

01:33:12.357 --> 01:33:14.367
Put the handcuffs on them.

01:33:14.402 --> 01:33:15.703
My pleasure.

01:33:16.445 --> 01:33:17.696
What's the charge?

01:33:17.697 --> 01:33:19.698
Conspiracy to obstruct justice,

01:33:19.699 --> 01:33:22.742
harboring a fugitive,
possession of a stolen weapon

01:33:22.743 --> 01:33:25.161
adds up to about 10 years
apiece for you birds.

01:33:25.162 --> 01:33:27.380
Operator, get me Clarence Darrow.

01:33:29.082 --> 01:33:32.177
Not even Houdini can
get you out of this.

01:33:32.627 --> 01:33:34.421
Now, listen, you pimple head,

01:33:34.422 --> 01:33:36.630
when I finish with you, you'll
wish you were never born.

01:33:36.631 --> 01:33:38.340
We'll butter the town
with your brains.

01:33:38.341 --> 01:33:39.800
Whistling in the dark, huh?

01:33:39.801 --> 01:33:41.595
We've been in tighter
spots than this.

01:33:41.596 --> 01:33:43.929
Remember that minister who
had us thrown into jail?

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.432
Rev. Godolphin.
Because we printed

01:33:45.433 --> 01:33:47.434
he conducted sex orgies
in the organ loft.

01:33:47.435 --> 01:33:49.853
Well, on the day of the trial,
he was on his way to court

01:33:49.854 --> 01:33:52.272
with all his lawyers and witnesses.

01:33:52.273 --> 01:33:54.940
Drowned, by God,
drowned in the river.

01:33:54.941 --> 01:33:58.445
With their automobile and their law
books and their goddamn affidavits.

01:33:58.446 --> 01:34:00.237
And I have the same
feeling right now

01:34:00.238 --> 01:34:01.947
that I had before that accident.

01:34:01.948 --> 01:34:04.868
You don't scare me, Burns.
Lock them up.

01:34:04.869 --> 01:34:06.961
Well, I...

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.289
Honey, get me extension 361.

01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:12.124
I tell you, Hartman,
there's a divine providence

01:34:12.125 --> 01:34:13.919
that watches over the Examiner.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.419
An unseen power.

01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:16.846
Out!

01:34:17.798 --> 01:34:19.299
What did you say, honey?

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.674
That's impossible.

01:34:20.675 --> 01:34:22.594
There's gotta be somebody there.

01:34:22.595 --> 01:34:23.938
It's the jail.

01:34:24.347 --> 01:34:27.273
 Swing low, sweet chariot

01:34:28.059 --> 01:34:30.860
 Coming for to carry me home

01:34:31.187 --> 01:34:34.823
 Swing low, sweet chariot

01:34:35.316 --> 01:34:37.943
 Coming for to carry me home

01:34:37.944 --> 01:34:40.403
 I looked over Jordan

01:34:40.404 --> 01:34:42.154
 And what did I see

01:34:42.155 --> 01:34:45.291
 Coming for to carry me home

01:34:46.369 --> 01:34:48.954
Hey, knock it off, will you?

01:34:48.955 --> 01:34:50.247
What time have you got?

01:34:50.248 --> 01:34:51.455
11:40.

01:34:51.456 --> 01:34:53.124
Where the hell's
Duffy with the bail?

01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:56.001
You have mixed up my whole
life, that's what you've done.

01:34:56.002 --> 01:34:58.213
Who me?
What a horse's ass I turned out to be.

01:34:58.214 --> 01:35:02.350
Falling for a song and dance like that.
They'll be namin' streets after me.

01:35:02.467 --> 01:35:05.553
I'll never meet another girl like that.
She was one in a million.

01:35:05.554 --> 01:35:07.639
I didn't know it was
anything that serious.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.015
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't I tell you?

01:35:10.016 --> 01:35:13.853
I'd be the last person in the world to
stand in the way of your happiness.

01:35:13.854 --> 01:35:16.690
Oh, you hypocritical, dirty...
Now that it's too late.

01:35:16.691 --> 01:35:19.109
It's never too late, kid,
because somebody up there...

01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:22.454
Don't give me that
unseen power crap!

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.222
You're making a big
mistake, officer.

01:35:50.223 --> 01:35:52.808
The Mayor is a personal
friend of mine.

01:35:52.809 --> 01:35:53.809
Sure he is.

01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:56.645
He's even let me use
his chopsticks.

01:35:56.646 --> 01:35:58.741
Get in there.

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.401
It was my one chance

01:36:02.402 --> 01:36:04.988
to get out of this rat race
and lead a normal life.

01:36:04.989 --> 01:36:07.449
By this time tomorrow, I
could've been a gentleman.

01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:09.784
Now, instead of Philadelphia,
I'm going to Joliet.

01:36:09.785 --> 01:36:12.703
What Joliet? In the first place,
they'll never indict us.

01:36:12.704 --> 01:36:14.873
In the second place,
no jury'll ever convict us.

01:36:14.874 --> 01:36:18.043
In the third place, we can always
get a reprieve from the governor.

01:36:18.044 --> 01:36:20.170
With all the dirt I've
got on every big shot...

01:36:20.171 --> 01:36:21.463
Funny you should mention that.

01:36:21.464 --> 01:36:22.505
Mention what?

01:36:22.506 --> 01:36:23.882
A reprieve from the governor.

01:36:23.883 --> 01:36:26.343
I just happen to have one on me.

01:36:26.344 --> 01:36:28.260
Get out of here, you're drunk.

01:36:28.261 --> 01:36:31.056
Oh, I'll say.
I was at this Chinese place.

01:36:31.057 --> 01:36:32.264
The Mayor sent me there.

01:36:32.265 --> 01:36:33.642
You know the Mayor, too?

01:36:33.643 --> 01:36:35.392
Oh, sure.
And the sheriff.

01:36:35.393 --> 01:36:38.230
Of course, I don't know them as
well as I know the governor.

01:36:38.231 --> 01:36:41.399
Wait a minute. If you've got a
reprieve, how come you're in jail?

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.068
Oh, it's not for me.

01:36:43.069 --> 01:36:44.110
It isn't?

01:36:44.111 --> 01:36:46.445
You see, I came down
from Springfield.

01:36:46.446 --> 01:36:48.581
Plunkett's the name.

01:36:51.619 --> 01:36:53.787
Proud of you, Pete.
You did a terrific job.

01:36:53.788 --> 01:36:55.622
All in a night's work, Your Honor.

01:36:55.623 --> 01:36:57.706
You can call me Herbie, again.

01:36:57.707 --> 01:36:59.166
Hey, look who's here.

01:36:59.167 --> 01:37:00.459
The Green Hornet.

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:02.096
Hi, Horny.

01:37:04.131 --> 01:37:05.881
What are those girls doing here?

01:37:05.882 --> 01:37:07.591
The Chink broads?
We just raided them.

01:37:07.592 --> 01:37:08.677
On whose orders?

01:37:08.678 --> 01:37:11.221
We always knock over a few
cathouses before election.

01:37:11.222 --> 01:37:14.056
You know that.
To get the family vote.

01:37:14.057 --> 01:37:15.307
Nice work.

01:37:15.308 --> 01:37:17.278
Thank you, Herbie.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.277
Here they are. Look kinda
natural, don't they, behind bars?

01:37:25.278 --> 01:37:27.279
A sight for sore eyes.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.822
I reckon you boys are gonna be

01:37:28.823 --> 01:37:30.699
away from Chicago for a long time.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.586
Yeah.
Making brooms and license plates.

01:37:34.996 --> 01:37:39.258
Maybe I can fix it for you to work
on a prison paper as copyboys.

01:37:40.792 --> 01:37:42.334
Hot in here, isn't it, Hildy?

01:37:42.335 --> 01:37:45.672
Yeah. Why don't you put in
some fans or ventilators?

01:37:45.673 --> 01:37:47.339
How about an
air-conditioning system?

01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:49.508
Scented with pine needles.

01:37:49.509 --> 01:37:50.719
Suit yourself.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.512
Because tomorrow, you guys
are gonna be in this cell.

01:37:53.513 --> 01:37:54.764
Big joke.

01:37:54.765 --> 01:37:56.975
Yeah.
We were just laughing about it,

01:37:56.976 --> 01:37:59.486
with our friend, Mr. Plunkett.

01:37:59.604 --> 01:38:01.103
Plunkett?

01:38:01.104 --> 01:38:03.741
Hiya, Mayor.
Hiya, Sheriff.

01:38:05.067 --> 01:38:06.318
Who is this man?

01:38:06.319 --> 01:38:08.028
Never saw him before in my life.

01:38:08.029 --> 01:38:10.030
I suppose you never saw
this before, either?

01:38:10.031 --> 01:38:11.113
What is it?

01:38:11.114 --> 01:38:12.364
A reprieve for Earl Williams.

01:38:12.365 --> 01:38:15.502
Hangin' a man just to
win an election, huh?

01:38:15.702 --> 01:38:16.952
Why, that's absurd.

01:38:16.953 --> 01:38:19.955
I don't know what you're
talking about. Do we, Herbie?

01:38:19.956 --> 01:38:21.917
Oh, such big liars.

01:38:21.918 --> 01:38:23.375
Let me see that.

01:38:23.376 --> 01:38:25.337
If Williams has been reprieved,

01:38:25.338 --> 01:38:26.755
I personally am tickled to death.

01:38:26.756 --> 01:38:30.257
Go on. You'd hang your own mother
for a couple of lousy votes.

01:38:30.258 --> 01:38:33.053
That's a terrible thing to
say, Burns, about anybody.

01:38:33.054 --> 01:38:35.898
Sheriff, this document
is authentic.

01:38:36.057 --> 01:38:38.225
Earl Williams, thank
God, has been reprieved.

01:38:38.226 --> 01:38:40.227
The commonwealth of
Chicago has been spared

01:38:40.228 --> 01:38:42.062
the necessity of
taking a human life.

01:38:42.063 --> 01:38:43.562
Save that for the Tribune.

01:38:43.563 --> 01:38:45.482
Pete, I want you to
release my friends,

01:38:45.483 --> 01:38:47.400
Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson.

01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:49.860
I was about to.
They're my friends, too.

01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:51.372
Jacobi.

01:38:51.906 --> 01:38:53.456
Open up.

01:38:54.408 --> 01:38:56.243
Don't be too hard on Pete, boys.

01:38:56.244 --> 01:38:57.993
He gets a little over
zealous sometimes.

01:38:57.994 --> 01:39:00.330
You goddamn hoodoo.

01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:02.624
What did I tell you?
An unseen power.

01:39:02.625 --> 01:39:04.750
Oh, yeah. Except by now,
I've missed the train.

01:39:04.751 --> 01:39:06.585
No. Mayor, here's what
I want you to do.

01:39:06.586 --> 01:39:07.586
Anything.

01:39:07.587 --> 01:39:09.923
There's a train leaving at
midnight for Philadelphia.

01:39:09.924 --> 01:39:11.967
Have them hold it for 10 minutes.
Got it.

01:39:11.968 --> 01:39:13.592
As for you, Sheriff.
You've got it.

01:39:13.593 --> 01:39:15.804
We need a police escort to
take Hildy to Union Station.

01:39:15.805 --> 01:39:18.223
How many do you want?
I have 200 men.

01:39:18.224 --> 01:39:19.723
Hey, what about me?

01:39:19.724 --> 01:39:22.111
Shut up, you goddamn hoodoo!

01:39:23.104 --> 01:39:24.405
Hoodoo?

01:40:04.394 --> 01:40:06.812
Hildy.
Hildy, you can't walk out on us.

01:40:06.813 --> 01:40:08.565
You can't leave your family.
I need you.

01:40:08.566 --> 01:40:09.815
The children need you.

01:40:09.816 --> 01:40:11.026
Daddy!
Daddy!

01:40:11.027 --> 01:40:12.319
What the hell?

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.653
All right, Myrtle.
That's enough. Can it.

01:40:14.654 --> 01:40:17.239
What's the matter, Mr. Burns?
Didn't I do it right?

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.992
You were perfect.
Here's $5.

01:40:18.993 --> 01:40:21.295
Split it between you.
Bye.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.704
What was that all about?

01:40:23.705 --> 01:40:25.624
Just a little somethin'
I had up my sleeve

01:40:25.625 --> 01:40:27.833
in case of a tie, but
it's not necessary now.

01:40:27.834 --> 01:40:29.345
Aha.

01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:00.741
Well, goodbye, Johnson.

01:41:00.742 --> 01:41:02.284
Take good care of him, Peggy.

01:41:02.285 --> 01:41:03.744
You're getting a great guy.

01:41:03.745 --> 01:41:05.497
Never mind the Valentine.

01:41:05.498 --> 01:41:07.456
You may not like what
I'm going to say

01:41:07.457 --> 01:41:10.126
but I don't believe you're as
tough as you pretend to be.

01:41:10.127 --> 01:41:12.470
Underneath it all, I think
you're a real softie.

01:41:13.381 --> 01:41:15.090
Well, don't let it get around.

01:41:15.091 --> 01:41:17.049
You crazy bastard.

01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:18.677
We'll sure miss you on the paper.

01:41:18.678 --> 01:41:21.595
Well, if I ever come back to
the business, which I won't,

01:41:21.596 --> 01:41:24.140
there's only one man I'd ever
work for. You know that.

01:41:24.141 --> 01:41:26.475
I'd kill you if you ever
worked for anybody else.

01:41:26.476 --> 01:41:28.477
Hear that, Peggy?
That's my diploma.

01:41:28.478 --> 01:41:30.447
All aboard!

01:41:32.567 --> 01:41:36.287
Wish I had time to get you
a wedding present. I know!

01:41:36.445 --> 01:41:38.320
What?
Walter, I couldn't take it.

01:41:38.321 --> 01:41:39.321
I insist.

01:41:39.322 --> 01:41:42.242
It was a present from
the big chief himself.

01:41:42.243 --> 01:41:44.244
And if you look on the inside

01:41:44.245 --> 01:41:46.162
you'll find a little inscription:

01:41:46.163 --> 01:41:48.540
"To the best newspaperman I know."

01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:49.749
When you get to Philadelphia,

01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:52.877
you can have my name scratched
out and put yours in its place.

01:41:52.878 --> 01:41:54.462
You know I wouldn't do that.

01:41:54.463 --> 01:41:56.265
Goodbye, Mr. Burns.

01:41:57.258 --> 01:41:59.259
Best of luck, you love birds!

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:01.478
Goodbye, you big palooka.

01:42:28.998 --> 01:42:30.999
That train that just left.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.958
What's the first stop?

01:42:32.959 --> 01:42:34.920
Gary, Indiana.

01:42:34.921 --> 01:42:39.391
All right. Send a message to the
police chief of Gary, Indiana.

01:42:39.674 --> 01:42:42.718
Tell them to meet the midnight
train to Philadelphia

01:42:42.719 --> 01:42:45.231
and arrest one Hildy Johnson.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:46.806
Hildy Johnson?

01:42:46.807 --> 01:42:47.973
Yeah.

01:42:47.974 --> 01:42:50.568
Son of a bitch stole my watch.
