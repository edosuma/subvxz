00:21.446 --> 00:23.676
Well, he's your dad.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.856
I mean it is his rule.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.293
Anyone who sleeps in late...

00:37.529 --> 00:38.628
Run, run, run.

00:42.901 --> 00:44.130
Honey.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.775
Are you all right?

00:51.777 --> 00:53.267
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:54.613 --> 00:57.173
Are you worried about today?

00:58.216 --> 01:02.519
I'm taking 150 teenagers
into the wilderness

01:02.521 --> 01:04.554
for three days.

01:04.556 --> 01:06.388
What's to worry about?

01:07.726 --> 01:08.887
You're right.

01:10.262 --> 01:13.254
There's nothing there to lose sleep over.

01:46.832 --> 01:47.856
Sterling?

01:49.768 --> 01:52.268
What are you listening to?

01:52.270 --> 01:53.897
General Conference.

01:55.707 --> 01:58.475
You're not supposed to have that.

01:58.477 --> 01:59.943
Mind your own business, okay?

01:59.945 --> 02:03.540
'Cause like sacrifice is for losers.

02:05.884 --> 02:07.383
Hey, that's mine.

02:10.622 --> 02:11.921
Gotta get down to the church,

02:11.923 --> 02:13.456
for all I know they could high diving

02:13.458 --> 02:14.958
into the baptismal fountain by now.

02:14.960 --> 02:15.892
Honey.

02:19.531 --> 02:21.030
It's a stake activity, you really think

02:21.032 --> 02:22.298
anyone's gonna be on time?

02:23.502 --> 02:25.602
See ya in three days.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.413
Make sure you
match the code on the sheet

02:37.415 --> 02:38.615
with the one on the envelope.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.482
We got it, mom.

02:39.484 --> 02:41.017
We're gonna
have to wrap this up.

02:41.019 --> 02:43.386
Hey, David Reader, is that us?

02:43.388 --> 02:45.288
That's right, Jamie, we had to use

02:45.290 --> 02:47.457
some of our own family history.

02:47.459 --> 02:48.925
How many of these
did you end up doing, gran?

02:48.927 --> 02:51.795
150, one for each trekker.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.062
Brother Pratt wanted to make sure

02:53.064 --> 02:54.998
that each of the kids
has someone to represent

02:55.000 --> 02:57.534
who actually crossed the plains.

02:57.536 --> 03:00.403
They mentioned that at
orientation, right Tom?

03:00.405 --> 03:02.071
Oh, I don't know, grandma.

03:02.073 --> 03:04.874
Well Brother Pratt,
he is such a great man.

03:04.876 --> 03:06.709
That's why it makes me so sad...

03:06.711 --> 03:09.012
Hey, hey Tom, have you
finished packing yet?

03:09.014 --> 03:11.381
We need to be down to the
church in a half an hour.

03:12.784 --> 03:15.351
The activities they plan
for the young people nowadays

03:15.353 --> 03:16.853
are so special.

03:16.855 --> 03:19.355
They come back with
such strong testimonies.

03:19.357 --> 03:21.057
You'll be all ready for you mission Tom.

03:21.059 --> 03:23.357
Oh yeah, that.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.489
Have you thought
about where you want to go?

03:27.732 --> 03:31.930
Yeah, I was thinking Brazil.

03:32.571 --> 03:35.438
Teaching among the Lamanites, wonderful.

03:36.107 --> 03:38.842
I was actually thinking
about all those nude beaches.

03:46.384 --> 03:47.584
At least we know your grandmother's

03:47.586 --> 03:49.054
pacemaker still works.

03:50.488 --> 03:53.355
Yeah well, would you
rather I told her the truth?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.797
All right, just go get your pack on.

04:00.799 --> 04:01.731
I'll take you to the stake center.

04:01.733 --> 04:03.466
No, I'm not going.

04:03.468 --> 04:04.133
Why not?

04:04.135 --> 04:07.103
Because I don't want to
pull a simulated handcart

04:07.105 --> 04:09.105
for three days so I can have a simulated

04:09.107 --> 04:11.941
spiritual experience and
gain a simulated testimony.

04:11.943 --> 04:13.877
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you had

04:13.879 --> 04:15.845
a great experience at
youth conference last year.

04:15.847 --> 04:18.781
Yeah, but that's when I thought

04:18.783 --> 04:20.683
all that stuff still worked.

04:22.754 --> 04:25.555
Listen Tom, I know it hurts...

04:25.557 --> 04:26.823
Oh, no I'm not.

04:26.825 --> 04:27.724
Forget about it.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.626
I'm going back to bed.

04:29.628 --> 04:31.687
Tom, just wait.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.697
Just give this a chance.

04:34.699 --> 04:36.900
I mean spend some time with your friends

04:36.902 --> 04:38.935
and hang out in the
trees and the fresh air.

04:38.937 --> 04:39.903
Look at the stars.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.871
I really don't want to.

04:41.873 --> 04:45.875
All right, no pressure here, but dude,

04:45.877 --> 04:48.011
it's a camp outwith girls.

04:48.013 --> 04:51.779
Dad, please don't ever
do that again, it's scary.

04:52.183 --> 04:54.948
Seriously though, if
you go on this trek,

04:55.720 --> 04:57.916
I'll pick up your ski pass this season.

04:59.858 --> 05:01.451
Deer Valley?

05:01.626 --> 05:03.059
Don't push it.

05:14.472 --> 05:16.065
Okay just...

05:19.077 --> 05:21.177
Are you gonna
carry that thing the whole way?

05:21.179 --> 05:24.681
Her name is Elizabeth
Barton, and I call her Lizzie.

05:24.683 --> 05:27.817
And yes, mothers carry their
children across the plain.

05:27.819 --> 05:29.585
That's because they had to, okay.

05:29.587 --> 05:31.888
It's not like they sewed
one just for the trip.

05:35.994 --> 05:38.027
At your level of spiritual development,

05:38.029 --> 05:40.129
I don't expect you to
understand it Sterling.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.633
Shauna, I have more
spirituality in this pinky

05:43.635 --> 05:45.101
than you do in your entire body.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.541
You know you can't
wear those clothes, right?

05:51.543 --> 05:53.242
Yeah, well
what I know is that you

05:53.244 --> 05:54.978
can mind your own business.

06:17.702 --> 06:19.936
Oh my freakin' heck!

06:28.747 --> 06:29.779
Good morning Susan.

06:29.781 --> 06:30.646
Good morning.

06:30.648 --> 06:31.647
Hey, do you have your test strips?

06:31.649 --> 06:32.515
Right in here.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.182
Great.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.851
Your blood sugar gets
low, you'll let me know.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.152
I know, I will.

06:36.154 --> 06:38.088
Okay thanks, have fun.

06:58.977 --> 07:01.144
You Pratt?

07:01.146 --> 07:02.712
Ms. Needles?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.081
Mr. Pratt, nice to finally meet you.

07:05.083 --> 07:05.982
This is Wendell.

07:05.984 --> 07:07.950
He drives the supply truck.

07:07.952 --> 07:09.318
Oh great, hi.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.320
So this your rodeo?

07:11.322 --> 07:12.755
My?

07:12.757 --> 07:13.790
Well I'm the medic...

07:13.792 --> 07:15.625
Are you the trail boss or not?

07:15.627 --> 07:17.660
Well I don't think
I call myself the boss

07:17.662 --> 07:19.195
that title belongs to my wife.

07:19.197 --> 07:20.930
We're looking for the
guy who can make sure

07:20.932 --> 07:25.168
nobody goes potty on the trail.

07:25.170 --> 07:28.071
Yeah well, then I guess I'm your guy.

07:44.189 --> 07:46.055
Morning Sister Bartlett.

07:46.057 --> 07:48.321
Good morning, Brother Crabbe.

07:51.196 --> 07:53.296
Outstanding day, isn't it?

07:53.298 --> 07:55.264
It is a really sunny day for a long...

07:55.266 --> 07:58.827
It reminds me of midsummer Reykjavik.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.939
The sky doesn't get any bluer.

08:09.214 --> 08:11.747
Yeah, Wes is gonna love
your hair after you've slept

08:11.749 --> 08:14.047
on the ground for three days.

08:15.753 --> 08:17.778
Get lost, you little creep.

08:18.756 --> 08:19.822
Hey.

08:19.824 --> 08:20.957
Hi.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.024
You look great.

08:22.026 --> 08:23.025
Really?

08:23.027 --> 08:23.858
Oh yeah.

08:25.363 --> 08:26.626
Thanks.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.908
Oh hey guys, I didn't mean.

08:43.381 --> 08:45.314
Oh, I can't tell you
how long I've waited

08:45.316 --> 08:46.943
for that to happen.

08:48.686 --> 08:50.286
Hey what happened to ya?

08:50.288 --> 08:52.155
I had to buy oranges.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.422
I thought you already had bought...

08:53.424 --> 08:54.323
Don't ask.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.020
Hey Brother Pratt.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.730
Yo dude, looking good
with the whole you know hat

09:00.732 --> 09:01.397
n'stuff like that.

09:01.399 --> 09:04.027
You look like one macho Mormon trekker.

09:04.269 --> 09:08.337
Well at least my face ain't
gonna get fried, gringo?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.306
You allowed to post that
'cause they don't let you

09:10.308 --> 09:11.707
bring electronics on this.

09:11.709 --> 09:12.375
Dude, relax.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.242
It's all good, okay.

09:13.244 --> 09:14.877
Brother Pratt asked me to bring it

09:14.879 --> 09:16.746
I guess to make a home
video about it or something.

09:16.748 --> 09:17.847
That's chill, that's chill.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.715
Just leave me out of it, okay?

09:19.717 --> 09:22.285
No worries, you're gonna
bring down my views anyway.

09:22.287 --> 09:23.386
That's harsh, man.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.787
That hurts my feel goods.

09:24.789 --> 09:27.224
Yeah well guess what, I hope it does.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.350
Hey look Tom came.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.196
I thought Tom wasn't comin'.

09:35.934 --> 09:37.129
Hey Tom!

09:37.368 --> 09:39.166
So what they give you?

09:39.337 --> 09:40.369
What?

09:40.371 --> 09:42.004
You know the parental
units, what did they give you

09:42.006 --> 09:44.473
to join this ritual of misery?

09:44.475 --> 09:46.309
Right, last we talked
you were binge watching

09:46.311 --> 09:47.843
The Walking Dead this weekend.

09:47.845 --> 09:50.213
Season pass, Park City.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.382
Sweet man, I wish my parents
would give into bribery.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.484
- Hi guys.
- Hi Brother Pratt.

09:55.486 --> 09:57.215
Got three days worth of batteries, Mike?

09:57.488 --> 09:59.354
Okay, the three of you look great.

09:59.991 --> 10:02.458
The two of you look
decidedly 21st century.

10:02.460 --> 10:05.094
Sister Bartlett has all kinds
of hats and vests and things.

10:05.096 --> 10:06.757
Go take care of it, will ya?

10:14.405 --> 10:15.938
Perfect.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.506
And, here we are folks already

10:17.508 --> 10:19.842
stepping back into history.

10:19.844 --> 10:22.912
Check out these
bandidos peligrosos.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.447
Say hello to history, boys.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.414
Okay, we're done.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.849
Turn that off.

10:26.851 --> 10:27.875
Hey Amanda.

10:28.820 --> 10:29.485
Hey guys.

10:29.487 --> 10:30.319
Hey Amanda.

10:30.321 --> 10:31.387
Who's your friend.

10:31.389 --> 10:33.483
This is my cousin Anna.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.958
This is Mike, and these are

10:36.961 --> 10:39.020
The Beverly Hillbillies.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.030
Howdy fellas.

10:41.032 --> 10:42.431
Hi, I'm Tom.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.802
Are you ready for this
bizarre cultural ritual thing?

10:46.804 --> 10:48.337
Let's call it Mormon cosplay.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.141
Nice, I like that.

10:52.143 --> 10:53.372
That's funny.

10:53.878 --> 10:54.777
Awkward.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.279
I'm Sterling by the way.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.179
Hey.

10:58.082 --> 10:59.815
So Mike,
you're going to video us?

10:59.817 --> 11:02.251
Yeah, Brother Pratt you
know he actually asked

11:02.253 --> 11:04.520
me to bring it, and so I brought it.

11:04.522 --> 11:06.286
And, yeah.

11:07.425 --> 11:09.291
Cool, cool.

11:10.828 --> 11:11.894
Oh, come on Anna.

11:11.896 --> 11:12.962
I want you to meet Marsha.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.864
She knows everything about everyone.

11:23.207 --> 11:24.140
Okay dude, she's gone.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.906
You can reconnect your brainstem.

11:26.544 --> 11:28.411
I didn't know anyone would
look that hot in gingham.

11:28.413 --> 11:31.514
Okay, okay listen 21 Pilots
three weeks from Friday.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.115
I got the tickets.

11:33.117 --> 11:34.915
She's not gonna come if you don't ask.

11:35.186 --> 11:38.187
I know it's just she can
get any guy she wants and so...

11:38.189 --> 11:39.989
Yeah, yeah, she can okay.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.558
So you gotta convince
her that that guy is you.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.459
It's you.

11:43.461 --> 11:45.995
I know I just, I know...

11:45.997 --> 11:47.129
Do you have a stutter?

11:47.131 --> 11:48.364
Okay, what are you talking about Mike?

11:48.366 --> 11:50.599
You've been waiting to turn
16, so you can ask her.

11:50.601 --> 11:52.468
Yeah, when no one's actually
gonna have a heart attack

11:52.470 --> 11:54.097
when you hold her hand.

11:54.405 --> 11:56.305
Listen, she has three
days where she can't

11:56.307 --> 11:58.071
even check her Instagram.

11:58.276 --> 11:59.575
Get it done.

11:59.577 --> 12:02.878
Hey Marsha, I want you
to meet my cousin Anna.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.015
Oh my heck, that is such a cute dress.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.383
Did you make it?

12:07.385 --> 12:09.518
No, it was my Aunt Elaine's.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.887
She made it for the road show I think.

12:11.889 --> 12:14.423
Oh, well this was my
sister Jill's dress.

12:14.425 --> 12:17.292
She wore it on a trek like
this I think three years ago.

12:17.395 --> 12:19.261
Well anyways, when she got back, it had

12:19.263 --> 12:21.027
all these spots on it.

12:21.265 --> 12:24.257
Turns out it was chicken blood.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.302
Ew.

12:26.304 --> 12:26.502
Ew.

12:26.504 --> 12:27.970
All right, thanks for gathering around.

12:27.972 --> 12:29.038
Let's get this thing started.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.873
Now, all of you got the list, right?

12:32.276 --> 12:33.376
You know what I mean?

12:33.378 --> 12:34.643
You remember the list?

12:34.645 --> 12:38.647
The list of things you can
and cannot take on trek list?

12:38.649 --> 12:41.384
Okay now listen, we're serious about this.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.954
In order to keep this reenactment
as realistic as possible,

12:44.956 --> 12:46.287
we're gonna stick to it.

12:46.457 --> 12:50.087
So there will be no extra
or unauthorized food,

12:50.661 --> 12:54.330
no technology of any
kind, no iPhones, iPads,

12:54.332 --> 12:57.166
Androids, Kindles, earbuds, you name it.

12:57.168 --> 12:59.402
Those of you with medical exceptions,

12:59.404 --> 13:00.636
you know who you are...

13:00.638 --> 13:03.369
As for the rest of
you, get your bags out.

13:04.142 --> 13:05.610
Judgment day's at hand.

13:06.277 --> 13:07.510
Thank you Brother Crabbe.

13:07.512 --> 13:09.078
Hey, just gather your things.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.248
We'll meet kindly under
the awning over there.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.115
Thank you.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.032
Oh man, I am so hosed.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.584
Guys, what am I going to do?

14:21.586 --> 14:24.453
Uh, start eating, man.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.991
Look, it's not funny, man okay.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.360
I got like $100 worth of food in here.

14:31.362 --> 14:34.332
Go ahead, make my day.

14:37.768 --> 14:41.337
Hi guys, I'm sorry, but
you're not really supposed

14:41.339 --> 14:43.639
to have those.

15:06.163 --> 15:09.224
Hey, I need that.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.033
Hey!

15:14.805 --> 15:17.072
Whatever happened to free agency, huh?

15:17.074 --> 15:20.743
The world's gonna hear about
this, hashtag satan's plan.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.211
What do you want?

15:22.213 --> 15:25.314
Look okay, we can open her head

15:25.316 --> 15:26.649
and stuff her full of food.

15:26.651 --> 15:27.650
That's sick.

15:27.652 --> 15:29.118
That's like cannibalism or something.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.453
Look you can stitch
her up in two seconds.

15:31.455 --> 15:33.656
Nobody's gonna know the difference at all.

15:33.658 --> 15:37.561
If sacrifice is for
losers, than that makes you?

15:38.529 --> 15:41.697
Okay, okay, look it's just a doll, man.

15:41.699 --> 15:43.432
I'm making you an offer.

15:43.434 --> 15:44.433
What do you want?

15:44.435 --> 15:45.266
Anything.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.139
I get to drive your car anytime I want

15:50.141 --> 15:51.802
for the rest of the summer.

15:53.377 --> 15:54.243
No.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.145
No, no, no, you just have your learners.

15:56.147 --> 15:57.613
Okay, you're going to crash it, no.

15:57.615 --> 15:59.848
Sterling, we're not negotiating here.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.478
Okay, okay, okay, just do it.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.221
Oh, and you're paying for gas.

16:06.223 --> 16:07.122
No way.

16:08.192 --> 16:09.625
Fine.

16:09.627 --> 16:11.160
Okay, okay.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.672
Oh, come on.

16:23.674 --> 16:26.234
It's 7:00 am. for heaven's sakes.

16:26.577 --> 16:28.377
Gross.

16:28.379 --> 16:29.878
Is this something I should worry about?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.313
It's all taken care of.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.443
Jesse's keeping an eye on them.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.116
Maybe this is an inspired activity.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.558
All right everyone,
before we hit the road,

16:42.560 --> 16:44.324
let's have a word of prayer.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.699
Mike, would you offer that for us please.

16:50.701 --> 16:52.434
Sure.

16:52.436 --> 16:54.461
And brethren, hats off.

16:59.343 --> 17:00.843
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank thee

17:00.845 --> 17:02.540
for this beautiful day.

17:02.747 --> 17:04.512
We thank thee for the
opportunity for all of us

17:04.515 --> 17:05.381
to go on trek.

17:05.383 --> 17:07.915
We're grateful to be out
here in this beautiful place

17:07.917 --> 17:09.818
with good friends.

17:09.819 --> 17:13.222
And please, we ask, Heavenly Father,

17:13.223 --> 17:15.257
that thou will watch
over us and be with us

17:15.259 --> 17:17.192
on the river today.

17:17.194 --> 17:19.395
Please bless Lehi doesn't get scared

17:19.396 --> 17:20.863
and cry on the river.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.798
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.665
Amen.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.334
Amen.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.403
Alright everyone, let's load up.

17:31.575 --> 17:33.242
All right, now we're
about to head out on trek.

17:33.244 --> 17:35.406
Let's find out what everyone has to say.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.777
Hey Lehi, do you think this
trek will be hard for ya?

17:42.319 --> 17:43.886
Oh come on, these things are gonna have

17:43.888 --> 17:46.188
like wheels, and there's gonna be

17:46.190 --> 17:47.723
like 10 people pulling 'em.

17:47.725 --> 17:49.258
What's the big deal?

17:49.260 --> 17:50.459
True, true, true.

17:50.461 --> 17:51.460
How 'bout you, Brad?

17:51.462 --> 17:53.228
What are you expecting out of this trek?

17:53.230 --> 17:55.297
I hope 10 minutes in it starts raining,

17:55.299 --> 17:57.768
and it keeps raining
for three days straight.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.468
That would be lit, right?

17:59.470 --> 18:00.335
Am I right?

18:00.337 --> 18:02.271
True, true.

18:02.273 --> 18:03.639
How 'bout you Bobby, you ready for this?

18:03.641 --> 18:04.707
I don't know.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.408
I'm gonna miss my phone.

18:06.410 --> 18:09.175
Ah, he's gonna miss his phone.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.979
Miss Anna, what are you expecting

18:10.981 --> 18:12.247
out of this trek?

18:12.249 --> 18:15.549
Ah, I honestly have no idea.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.420
Me too, actually.

18:18.422 --> 18:19.655
How 'bout you Shauna?

18:19.657 --> 18:20.920
Worried about any snakes?

18:21.692 --> 18:23.625
There are gonna be snakes?

18:23.627 --> 18:24.493
I'm out.

18:24.495 --> 18:25.661
I can't do this.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.296
Me neither.

18:27.298 --> 18:33.328
Amanda, um, sorry, what are
you expecting this trek?

18:34.939 --> 18:37.306
I don't know, maybe lose a few pounds.

18:37.475 --> 18:40.342
I think you're fine
just the way you are actually.

18:40.678 --> 18:42.373
Well thanks, Mike.

18:46.317 --> 18:47.850
Mike, shut it off.

18:47.852 --> 18:50.252
I don't even have all my makeup on today.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.415
Sorry.

18:53.657 --> 18:55.758
Look into my eyes, Mike.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.792
Three days.

18:56.794 --> 18:58.460
All right
everybody let's load 'em up.

18:58.462 --> 18:59.394
Three days.

18:59.396 --> 19:00.596
Come on, come on.

19:00.598 --> 19:01.630
Let's go.

20:13.938 --> 20:18.899
I've got one question, what
the hell are we doing up here?

20:20.878 --> 20:23.370
What you want to go down?

20:23.581 --> 20:24.412
No.

20:25.416 --> 20:27.082
They'll think we're a
bunch of weenies right now

20:27.084 --> 20:28.711
if we go back down.

20:31.922 --> 20:33.447
See you in the river.

20:41.498 --> 20:42.727
Oh crap.

20:45.669 --> 20:46.500
Tom?

20:50.441 --> 20:51.067
Tom?

20:52.943 --> 20:57.471
Tom, it's time to go.

21:34.818 --> 21:37.378
All right everyone, listen up.

21:38.455 --> 21:40.956
All right, let me turn some
time over to Ms. Needles

21:40.958 --> 21:42.925
for a few last reminders.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.860
She's the head of Another Man's Shoes

21:44.862 --> 21:46.995
Living History Reenactment Excursions.

21:46.997 --> 21:49.466
So please everyone, listen up.

21:50.200 --> 21:55.502
As of this moment, we
are guests on federal land.

21:55.773 --> 21:59.775
And, they expect us to
follow a few simple rules.

21:59.777 --> 22:04.079
Number one, stay on the designated trail.

22:04.081 --> 22:07.516
If you get separated,
follow the white cow skulls.

22:07.518 --> 22:09.584
That's what they're there for.

22:09.586 --> 22:16.024
Number two, no fires
except in designated areas

22:16.026 --> 22:17.726
at designated times.

22:17.728 --> 22:21.630
Number three, don't leave trash

22:21.632 --> 22:24.567
of any kind behind.

22:25.002 --> 22:30.105
So if you drop it, pick it up or someone

22:30.107 --> 22:33.839
may very well make you eat it.

22:35.179 --> 22:39.848
Okay, that's, thank you, Ms. Needles.

22:43.954 --> 22:45.087
All right, I need the following people

22:45.089 --> 22:48.457
to come up here and form a line please.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.854
Jeremy Wright,

22:51.862 --> 22:53.887
Chelsea Martin,

22:54.999 --> 22:56.558
Tom Jensen,

22:58.902 --> 23:00.666
Amanda Peterson,

23:02.806 --> 23:04.240
Anna McDowell.

23:05.142 --> 23:06.608
Do they know, I'm not...

23:06.610 --> 23:08.043
Don't worry about it, come on.

23:08.045 --> 23:09.069
Sterling Bennet,

23:11.548 --> 23:12.674
Marsha Hegstrom,

23:15.252 --> 23:16.617
Mike Sandoval.

23:19.089 --> 23:22.124
All right, in the past
your leaders have been

23:22.126 --> 23:23.792
the parents of your groups.

23:23.794 --> 23:24.926
But, we feel there's an opportunity

23:24.928 --> 23:27.295
for you older kids to learn things

23:27.297 --> 23:29.197
a little bit differently.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.966
Your leaders are still gonna be with you,

23:30.968 --> 23:33.733
but this time you're in charge.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.038
Anna, can I see that envelope?

23:36.040 --> 23:36.871
Thank you.

23:37.074 --> 23:39.041
Now, there are two
envelopes of each color,

23:39.043 --> 23:41.209
one for the ma, and one for the pa.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.812
Inside is the rest of your family group.

23:43.814 --> 23:47.716
Your job is to help the
company, keep 'em happy,

23:47.718 --> 23:49.718
make sure they drink plenty of water,

23:49.720 --> 23:52.754
and rub their feet if they get tired.

23:52.756 --> 23:54.122
Except you Sterling.

23:54.124 --> 23:55.190
All right, find your partners.

23:55.192 --> 23:56.224
We've gotta move quickly.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.854
We've got a lot of ground
to cover, all right?

24:06.203 --> 24:07.602
Always knew I'd end up with someone

24:07.604 --> 24:09.629
tall, dark, and handsome.

24:10.974 --> 24:11.907
Hi.

24:11.909 --> 24:12.774
Hey.

24:12.776 --> 24:14.142
I guess you and I...

24:14.144 --> 24:15.771
Yeah, I guess.

24:17.681 --> 24:20.715
In each of your
envelopes is the biography

24:20.717 --> 24:23.318
of someone who walked over 1,000 miles

24:23.320 --> 24:27.120
to join with the saints
in Zion in the 18408.

24:28.092 --> 24:32.051
A lot of people gave up their
lives to make that journey.

24:33.263 --> 24:37.666
But, sacrifice is a very
personal experience.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.270
And, no one knows really how they're gonna

24:42.272 --> 24:45.242
react when they're asked
to give up something

24:49.213 --> 24:51.739
they never imagined they'd lose.

24:53.317 --> 24:56.017
These people did, and
maybe there's something

24:56.019 --> 24:57.578
they can teach us.

24:59.189 --> 25:03.319
Okay, it's a beautiful morning,
got a long day ahead of us.

25:04.094 --> 25:05.327
Let's walk.

26:15.232 --> 26:17.399
So you Amanda are cousins?

26:17.401 --> 26:21.804
Yeah, I'm just visiting for awhile.

26:22.239 --> 26:24.139
Where are you from?

26:24.141 --> 26:25.240
Los Angeles.

26:25.242 --> 26:26.232
Oh wow.

26:27.077 --> 26:29.978
You ever do one of these before?

26:29.980 --> 26:35.885
Ah no, I'm not, I
don't go to your church.

26:37.154 --> 26:40.454
Oh you, oh.

26:41.825 --> 26:44.125
So my cousin when she did trek,

26:44.127 --> 26:46.328
she had the first day a blister
on the sides of her foot

26:46.330 --> 26:48.396
like the size of a quarter.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.265
And then by the next day, it was like

26:50.267 --> 26:52.100
the size of a dollar.

26:52.102 --> 26:54.402
And, then I swear I'm not joking,

26:54.404 --> 26:57.169
on the third day, it
was like half her foot.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.038
Isn't that crazy?

27:02.312 --> 27:03.745
Hey Amanda?

27:03.747 --> 27:04.412
Yeah.

27:04.414 --> 27:08.180
So I was wondering
you know if maybe you...

27:22.799 --> 27:25.200
So who was Mary Thompson.

27:25.202 --> 27:30.368
Ah she, I was born in England in 1822.

27:31.375 --> 27:34.943
Me and my husband Daniel,
that would be you,

27:34.945 --> 27:36.311
were taught the gospel by someone named

27:36.313 --> 27:38.280
Hebrew C. Kimble.

27:38.282 --> 27:42.241
We crossed the ocean in
1849 to join the saints.

27:44.354 --> 27:45.344
Oh my gosh.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.287
What?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.959
Along the way, we lost two children,

27:50.961 --> 27:53.487
a six year old boy and
a three year old girl.

27:54.564 --> 27:56.097
Our provisions have grown so scarce

27:56.099 --> 27:59.501
that we have to suck on the
seems of the flour sacks

27:59.503 --> 28:01.569
in a final attempt to draw the last dregs

28:01.571 --> 28:04.131
of nourishment from the threads.

28:06.376 --> 28:08.344
That's so sad, you know?

28:09.146 --> 28:11.146
I mean what would you even do.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.447
Just so...

28:12.449 --> 28:16.283
So helpless, so alone.

28:18.288 --> 28:20.255
You know what's
so cool about fires?

28:20.257 --> 28:21.088
What?

28:22.492 --> 28:25.484
Everything around us just disappears.

28:27.564 --> 28:33.264
I mean like there's no
trees, no rocks, no water.

28:35.072 --> 28:37.339
It's like we're completely alone.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.275
Well you think you're
alone, but really anyone

28:40.277 --> 28:42.977
who's within five miles can see you.

28:42.979 --> 28:44.947
Well you see that's what's so cool.

28:45.415 --> 28:49.617
Like we're alone, but we're not.

29:07.637 --> 29:09.170
Let's break.

29:09.172 --> 29:13.871
Chow! Just pull your
carts up here along the fence.

29:14.344 --> 29:15.903
Chow!

29:42.305 --> 29:44.069
Ah, what's this?

29:45.108 --> 29:47.509
That's lunch, eat up brother.

29:48.612 --> 29:49.644
Lunch?

29:49.646 --> 29:52.113
Like this isn't lunch.

29:52.115 --> 29:54.106
It's not even a snack.

29:55.519 --> 29:56.985
You don't want it?

29:56.987 --> 29:58.319
No, I don't.

29:58.321 --> 30:02.257
I mean I want it, but like
you don't have any more, do you?

30:05.395 --> 30:09.093
Son, are you a priesthood holder?

30:11.501 --> 30:12.332
Yeah.

30:24.981 --> 30:28.383
Did I just have my personal
priesthood interview?

30:28.385 --> 30:29.651
Hey Shauna, how's the baby?

30:29.653 --> 30:30.518
What?

30:30.520 --> 30:33.285
You know the baby, the
one that has my stuff in it?

30:33.690 --> 30:35.623
Geez, you don't have to make
it sound like a drug deal.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.992
Well hey man, okay, I'm dying here.

30:37.994 --> 30:38.726
You're pathetic.

30:38.728 --> 30:39.594
Thank you.

30:39.596 --> 30:41.329
- Sterling, Sterling.
- What?

30:41.331 --> 30:42.230
Hey, come with me will ya?

30:42.232 --> 30:43.731
We've got a lot of
blistered feet to deal with.

30:43.733 --> 30:46.134
And, you've got your first
aid merit badge, right?

30:46.136 --> 30:47.101
Yeah.

30:47.103 --> 30:47.969
Perfect.

30:47.971 --> 30:48.636
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.469
Come on.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.140
I've seen that.

31:40.056 --> 31:42.286
Amanda's really pretty, isn't she?

31:44.160 --> 31:46.595
She's, yeah.

31:48.398 --> 31:50.992
Have you thought about
maybe asking her out?

31:51.334 --> 31:53.564
She can go outwith any guy she wants.

31:54.237 --> 31:56.638
Mike, any girl here would be thrilled

31:56.640 --> 31:58.606
to go outwith you, any of them.

31:58.608 --> 32:00.308
Don't make it so hard.

32:00.310 --> 32:01.409
You think so?

32:01.411 --> 32:03.278
Absolutely.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.305
Dating should be fun.

32:05.649 --> 32:07.181
You know find someone you connect with

32:07.183 --> 32:09.345
and just let things happen.

32:11.688 --> 32:13.679
And, do me a favor will you?

32:14.190 --> 32:16.491
Whoever you choose, don't just text.

32:18.428 --> 32:21.056
Hold her hand, look in her eye.

32:22.365 --> 32:24.499
You know that's pretty
old school Sister Hanson.

32:25.669 --> 32:28.229
Yeah well, don't knock
it till you try it.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.072
Care for another
orange, Sister Bartlett?

32:35.245 --> 32:37.543
Oh, I don't know.

32:38.448 --> 32:39.540
Is it legal?

32:41.117 --> 32:43.484
Well, if you were a teenage
boy who needed to learn

32:43.486 --> 32:46.321
about discipline and sacrifice, maybe not.

32:46.323 --> 32:49.418
But, since that isn't the case.

32:51.361 --> 32:52.328
Thank you.

32:55.332 --> 32:58.529
That's what I love about this church.

32:58.702 --> 33:02.637
Every activity, every
interaction is designed

33:02.639 --> 33:06.608
to help us realize the truth within us.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.109
Have you been in the church long.

33:08.111 --> 33:13.379
473 days, best year
and a half of my life.

33:15.352 --> 33:18.820
How did you first run into the church?

33:18.822 --> 33:22.490
I was in Cartagena doing
electronic surveillance

33:22.492 --> 33:27.328
on an interest I can't disclose

33:27.430 --> 33:30.531
when two young men in
white shirts and ties

33:30.533 --> 33:32.567
knocked on the door of my bungalow

33:32.569 --> 33:36.403
and introduced me to a
new way of viewing life.

33:39.309 --> 33:41.809
So what were you before that?

33:41.811 --> 33:43.779
I was a pagan animist.

33:45.682 --> 33:50.518
I'm sorry I'm not familiar
with a pagan animist.

33:51.621 --> 33:53.655
Mostly I worshiped snakes.

33:55.258 --> 33:56.491
Come on, gather around.

33:56.493 --> 33:57.324
Let's go.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.495
Hey you've got the pair?

34:00.497 --> 34:04.465
All right people, we've got a few hours.

34:04.467 --> 34:06.801
Let's get rolling, come on.

34:34.931 --> 34:36.864
So why are you doing this?

34:36.866 --> 34:38.630
I was visiting Amanda.

34:38.967 --> 34:40.368
I guess I could've stayed there

34:40.370 --> 34:41.735
and watched Amazon Prime.

34:41.737 --> 34:43.603
And instead, you're
walking for three days

34:43.606 --> 34:45.404
and going without food.

34:45.675 --> 34:47.308
Why are you doing it?

34:47.310 --> 34:49.835
My dad said he's buying me a ski pass.

34:50.313 --> 34:51.678
Why would he do that?

34:52.882 --> 34:54.514
I think maybe he thinks it's going

34:54.516 --> 34:55.916
to improve my attitude.

34:56.686 --> 34:57.952
What's wrong with your attitude?

34:57.954 --> 34:59.620
What are you a reporter or something?

34:59.622 --> 35:00.788
Yeah actually.

35:00.790 --> 35:03.691
I'm studying journalism
in college in the fall,

35:03.693 --> 35:04.792
and you didn't answer my question.

35:04.794 --> 35:06.728
Look, let me tell you something.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.397
You hang around Mormons long enough,

35:09.399 --> 35:11.799
you find out that
everybody knows what's true

35:11.801 --> 35:13.468
and what's right, and
they're all just waiting

35:13.470 --> 35:14.960
to help you find it.

35:16.339 --> 35:20.007
So wanting to help you is a bad thing?

35:20.009 --> 35:21.977
Yeah it is if it's all just made up.

35:25.548 --> 35:26.547
I don't know how anybody knows

35:26.549 --> 35:28.244
What's true about anything.

35:32.722 --> 35:37.291
Okay, so the Three Nephites,
they're out there

35:37.293 --> 35:40.461
preaching, saving lives, right?

35:40.463 --> 35:41.529
Okay.

35:41.531 --> 35:44.499
Okay, so what I want
to know is what they'd do

35:44.501 --> 35:45.733
in their time off.

35:45.735 --> 35:47.368
I don't think they get time off.

35:47.370 --> 35:48.536
Well they got to get a day off,

35:48.538 --> 35:50.438
so what did they do?

35:50.440 --> 35:54.709
Go water skiing, play video
games, get a smoothie?

35:54.711 --> 35:57.478
They have visions, bro.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.414
Like they see the whole
history of the universe.

36:00.416 --> 36:02.750
Super Smash Brothers ain't
gonna cut it with these guys.

36:02.752 --> 36:06.454
But, the prophet's
seen movies, hasn't he?

36:06.456 --> 36:07.946
Maybe PG movies.

36:09.692 --> 36:14.892
- Or PG-13, shoot.
- PG-13, shoot.

36:21.604 --> 36:25.302
Is this child you
carry, Elizabeth Barton?

36:26.376 --> 36:27.002
Yeah.

36:29.412 --> 36:32.480
We gather together
today to mourn the death

36:32.482 --> 36:33.514
of baby Elizabeth Barton,

36:33.516 --> 36:34.582
Hey have you seen Shauna?

36:34.584 --> 36:36.551
- Shush dude, it's a funeral.
- A member of Edward Martin's

36:36.553 --> 36:40.521
Handcart Company who was
only 1 and 1/2 years old

36:40.523 --> 36:43.090
when she passed away in her mother's arms

36:43.092 --> 36:46.790
on July sixth, 1856.

36:47.730 --> 36:50.431
Lizzie's father, William
Barton, followed her in death

36:50.433 --> 36:53.534
on September 30th leaving
his wife, Mary Anne

36:53.536 --> 36:55.036
Wait, what are they doing?

36:55.038 --> 36:56.637
and her other daughter Mary Barton

36:56.639 --> 36:59.472
to finish their trek by themselves.

37:01.611 --> 37:02.442
No, no!

37:04.013 --> 37:06.607
No, you can't do that!

37:10.887 --> 37:13.481
Wow, he's really getting into it.

37:13.623 --> 37:15.756
Better put some rocks on that grave

37:15.758 --> 37:18.887
to keep the wolves from
getting to the body.

37:20.396 --> 37:21.762
But, but...

37:21.764 --> 37:23.789
Dude, it's just a doll.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.093
Sorry bro.

37:31.007 --> 37:33.841
Come on Sterling, let's
just try to walk it off,

37:33.843 --> 37:34.909
shall we?

37:49.692 --> 37:51.893
What do I want to eat?
Fried chicken,

37:51.895 --> 37:54.996
potatoes and gravy, and a giant lemonade.

37:54.998 --> 37:56.130
That's what I want.

37:56.132 --> 37:59.100
I want a big half pound burger

37:59.102 --> 38:01.662
with lettuce, tomato, ketchup.

38:05.041 --> 38:09.706
Homemade scones with butter
and my mom's apricot jam.

38:14.617 --> 38:15.816
Mike!

38:15.818 --> 38:18.583
Porterhouse Steak, medium rare.

38:19.555 --> 38:22.149
Pizza with pepperoni and sausage.

38:24.761 --> 38:25.927
Blueberry pie.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.762
Strawberry shake about this big.

38:29.699 --> 38:34.035
Sushi, like crunchy spider roll.

38:34.037 --> 38:36.005
There's not actual spiders in it.

38:37.073 --> 38:38.905
Bacon with anything.

38:45.581 --> 38:47.715
Okay everyone, since we're all here,

38:47.717 --> 38:49.483
I guess we can eat.

38:49.485 --> 38:52.648
Sister Hanson, would you
please bless the food for us?

38:56.626 --> 38:58.125
Our Father in heaven, we thank thee

38:58.127 --> 39:03.088
for delivering us safely to
this place of beauty and rest.

39:03.199 --> 39:06.000
We thank thee for this food
that we are about to partake of

39:06.002 --> 39:08.630
and ask for a blessing upon it.

39:09.572 --> 39:13.240
Help us to feel thy holy spirit
and follow its promptings.

39:19.182 --> 39:20.982
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.952
Am en.

39:23.853 --> 39:26.253
All right
everyone, we have hot soup

39:26.255 --> 39:28.622
and rolls for you tonight.

39:28.624 --> 39:30.524
Anybody hungry?

39:30.526 --> 39:31.859
Yeah.

39:31.861 --> 39:33.794
Is that it, really?

39:33.796 --> 39:35.229
After that long day, nothing?

39:35.231 --> 39:36.097
Nothing?

39:36.099 --> 39:38.165
Let's go get some food, come on.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.266
All right.

39:45.875 --> 39:48.943
So how'd it go for you guys?

39:48.945 --> 39:50.611
Oh, it was great.

39:50.613 --> 39:52.880
You know I got to bandage people's feet

39:52.882 --> 39:53.981
today which was awesome.

39:53.983 --> 39:57.084
And oh, I watched my
Hershey Bar get buried alive

39:57.086 --> 39:58.619
which is awesome.

39:58.621 --> 39:59.754
And yeah, when that wasn't happening,

39:59.756 --> 40:02.256
I had to listen to Marsha
Hegstrom talk my ear off.

40:02.258 --> 40:04.725
So I don't know, eight out of 10 today.

40:04.727 --> 40:08.629
You know I think Marsha's kind of cool.

40:08.631 --> 40:13.228
Oh man, that girl can
talk paint off a wall.

40:14.137 --> 40:15.866
How 'bout you?

40:16.172 --> 40:17.638
How's Amanda?

40:17.640 --> 40:20.541
Look I was kind of busy
with the whole video thing,

40:20.543 --> 40:22.043
so I really haven't had a chance to just...

40:22.045 --> 40:23.535
No, no dude.

40:24.247 --> 40:26.180
You have to talk to her, okay?

40:26.182 --> 40:28.849
She's not gonna say yes if you don't ask.

40:28.851 --> 40:30.618
Listen, I will.

40:30.620 --> 40:31.951
Right.

40:32.221 --> 40:37.250
How 'bout you with Anna, Anna?

40:37.593 --> 40:39.060
You guys spent all day together.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.829
Yeah, yeah, she's very cool.

40:41.831 --> 40:42.897
She's not Mormon.

40:42.899 --> 40:43.764
Shut up.

40:43.766 --> 40:44.865
Hey wait a minute.

40:44.867 --> 40:46.934
Doesn't that kind of complicate things?

40:46.936 --> 40:48.961
I don't know, does it?

40:49.972 --> 40:51.672
Yeah fight, like you're gonna go

40:51.674 --> 40:53.140
gallivanting off with a no-mo.

40:53.142 --> 40:54.008
I might.

40:54.010 --> 40:55.309
You know your mom
would freak out, right?

40:55.311 --> 40:57.611
Well, I'm through
obeying all these rules

40:57.613 --> 41:00.247
by some guy I don't even
know who invented them

41:00.249 --> 41:01.982
to save me from being normal.

41:01.984 --> 41:03.317
Whoa dude, just chill out.

41:03.319 --> 41:04.718
No, you chill out!

41:06.789 --> 41:08.189
Not everyone's trying to turn themselves

41:08.191 --> 41:10.558
into some Later Day droid, Sterling.

41:11.027 --> 41:12.927
Man, what's your problem?

41:18.868 --> 41:19.835
I'm sorry.

41:23.706 --> 41:25.674
I shouldn't have said that.

41:28.044 --> 41:30.211
Could you hold this for a second?

41:30.213 --> 41:31.044
Thank you.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.215
Oh you know I could
never stay mad at you.

41:34.217 --> 41:35.316
You crazy.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.718
You're getting soup on my pants.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.853
Yeah so when my sister did trek,

41:38.855 --> 41:41.055
they just murdered chickens.

41:41.057 --> 41:42.089
Nice pants, Tom.

41:42.091 --> 41:44.253
I mean so the soup was
like really a luxury.

41:48.164 --> 41:49.997
Did I tell you about
the spots on my dress.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.799
I mean they were everywhere,
and it turned out

41:51.801 --> 41:53.360
it was chicken blood.

41:56.372 --> 41:58.305
So what's going on with you and Tom?

41:58.307 --> 42:00.298
Did I see something happening there?

42:02.178 --> 42:03.339
I don't know.

42:05.414 --> 42:06.779
What's he like?

42:07.984 --> 42:09.316
I think Tom's a great guy.

42:09.318 --> 42:14.255
You know he's sweet, and
he thinks about things,

42:14.257 --> 42:16.726
not just cars and football.

42:18.194 --> 42:19.684
He just...

42:21.898 --> 42:22.729
What?

42:24.967 --> 42:27.698
Well there was an accident last summer,

42:27.970 --> 42:31.201
and Tom's best friend,
Brother Pratt's son,

42:32.909 --> 42:34.741
he was killed.

42:35.845 --> 42:36.812
Oh.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.446
Yeah so...

42:39.448 --> 42:42.816
Attention campers,

42:42.818 --> 42:48.416
if you haven't noticed,
dinner as it were, is over.

42:49.125 --> 42:52.826
So before you bed down for the night,

42:52.828 --> 43:00.997
you may want to spend a few
minutes taking in this wonder.

43:02.705 --> 43:06.266
Oh, and watch out for rattlers.

43:23.960 --> 43:26.361
Imagine when it was
like this every night,

43:27.363 --> 43:34.861
no Netflix, no internet, just this.

43:38.975 --> 43:41.034
Not a bad show.

43:44.280 --> 43:47.272
We sure don't get skies like this in LA.

43:48.951 --> 43:51.045
Look you can see the Big Dipper.

43:53.189 --> 43:54.213
Wait where?

43:55.791 --> 43:56.790
It's right there.

43:56.792 --> 43:59.318
You see the Little Dipper pointing to it.

43:59.762 --> 44:02.296
Ah, you can find
whatever you want up there

44:02.298 --> 44:03.891
if you look hard enough.

44:06.002 --> 44:09.495
Look you see that little
group of stars over there?

44:11.107 --> 44:12.734
You know what that is?

44:13.809 --> 44:15.106
What?

44:15.344 --> 44:16.910
That's a jacuzzi.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.948
Oh a jacuzzi.

44:21.517 --> 44:23.451
All that warm water.

44:25.021 --> 44:27.183
I can feel the bubbles on my toes.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.459
All right, it's time to get some sleep.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.028
You've got another long day tomorrow.

44:34.030 --> 44:35.829
Brethren, you're with me.

44:35.831 --> 44:36.821
Let's go.

44:45.041 --> 44:49.043
We'll call it 220
yards south, southwest.

45:02.091 --> 45:07.027
So, do you two want to get
back to where you belong,

45:07.029 --> 45:10.829
or should the three of us
kneel down and pray together?

45:41.230 --> 45:43.062
Good morning, girls.

45:47.103 --> 45:49.336
How does she look so good?

45:49.338 --> 45:51.500
Doesn't it make you sick?

45:54.009 --> 45:57.511
Tracey, did your boys top
up their water cooler yet?

45:57.513 --> 45:59.480
Yes, they did last night.

45:59.482 --> 46:01.416
Okay, thanks.

46:07.523 --> 46:11.225
In the fall of 1856, the Martin Handcart

46:11.227 --> 46:12.922
Company hit trouble.

46:14.363 --> 46:17.060
They'd walked hundreds of miles.

46:18.334 --> 46:19.995
They'd run out of food.

46:21.637 --> 46:25.506
And, at one point in a
place called Devil's Gate,

46:25.508 --> 46:28.603
Wyoming, it began to snow.

46:30.079 --> 46:34.073
Heavy, wet flakes fell for hours.

46:35.017 --> 46:39.420
And, as they watched that
path ahead of them disappear,

46:39.422 --> 46:44.053
they knew that freezing and
death were just hours away.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.091
How do you think they handled that?

46:51.133 --> 46:53.659
Did they blame God?

46:55.337 --> 46:59.506
Did they curse heaven
for being left so alone

46:59.508 --> 47:02.500
on that empty, frozen desert?

47:04.413 --> 47:05.471
No.

47:14.623 --> 47:20.727
That morning, those 250
men, women, and children

47:20.729 --> 47:24.597
gathered together, and they prayed.

47:26.235 --> 47:27.566
They prayed.

47:29.538 --> 47:34.237
And, then sang the Spirit of
God like a Fire Is Burning.

47:37.713 --> 47:43.250
Though I hate to break
this to you, but there's

47:43.252 --> 47:46.244
a Devil's Gate waiting out
there for each one of us.

47:47.122 --> 47:51.684
Probably not today or
tomorrow, but at some point,

47:53.696 --> 47:56.666
God will push us to the very edge

47:57.700 --> 48:02.638
so that we can learn what it
is that we really believe.

48:04.507 --> 48:08.642
And, I hope at that point that we'll have

48:08.644 --> 48:15.277
the faith that they had to look eternity

48:15.751 --> 48:24.216
in the face and to know
that He really knows us.

48:31.467 --> 48:32.298
Okay.

48:34.436 --> 48:35.335
Let's walk.

48:58.494 --> 48:59.518
Hey.

49:03.799 --> 49:04.765
You okay?

49:07.069 --> 49:08.730
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.474
We're supposed to get going soon.

49:14.476 --> 49:19.680
Okay, great.

49:23.352 --> 49:24.217
Is there anything that I can...

49:24.219 --> 49:30.090
There's nothing
anyone can do, but thanks.

49:31.860 --> 49:33.360
Come on.

49:57.653 --> 50:01.555
So Amanda, I got these
tickets to 21 Pilots,

50:01.557 --> 50:04.591
and you know I was just
thinking maybe if you're

50:04.593 --> 50:07.260
not committed to doing
something with someone else

50:07.262 --> 50:10.330
that night that you know
maybe you and I could,

50:10.332 --> 50:11.732
yeah that's great.

50:11.734 --> 50:12.833
Just commit.

50:12.835 --> 50:14.735
No, I should be committed.

50:14.737 --> 50:17.471
I'm a freakin' idiot, man.

50:20.809 --> 50:22.436
You know what I'd like to see?

50:23.712 --> 50:24.543
What?

50:25.714 --> 50:27.341
A pioneer's foot.

50:28.884 --> 50:32.752
I mean could you imagine the
callouses on that sucker?

50:33.889 --> 50:36.523
Guarantee they're an inch and a 1/2 thick.

50:36.525 --> 50:38.493
Maybe a couple toes frozen off.

50:39.461 --> 50:42.692
Yeah, that'd strengthen
my testimony for sure.

50:45.801 --> 50:47.565
Oh man.

50:50.606 --> 50:52.665
Oh, great.

50:53.308 --> 50:57.211
Oh, my heck.

50:59.648 --> 51:03.516
Whoo, gird up your loins.

51:03.786 --> 51:07.154
Yippee ki-yay, whoo!

51:17.933 --> 51:20.467
Okay everybody, ready to go?

51:20.469 --> 51:22.669
All right, let's do it!

51:30.679 --> 51:31.510
Come on.

51:32.781 --> 51:34.247
Come on, guys.

51:34.249 --> 51:36.479
Let's go, let's go.

51:42.458 --> 51:43.890
Keep pushing, come on.

51:44.893 --> 51:46.693
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

51:46.695 --> 51:48.895
Come on, come on, come on.

52:03.779 --> 52:08.014
Remember it's not the
strength of your muscles, son,

52:08.016 --> 52:09.882
it's the strength of your faith.

52:10.886 --> 52:11.717
Okay.

52:15.524 --> 52:17.288
All right next one.

52:22.798 --> 52:25.532
Sterling, you're not even pulling, help!

52:25.534 --> 52:26.633
Marsha, not the time.

52:26.635 --> 52:27.734
Come on, Sterling, pull!

52:27.736 --> 52:29.226
Shut up Marsha.

52:56.932 --> 52:58.024
Yay.

52:58.767 --> 52:59.866
Thank the maker.

52:59.868 --> 53:01.358
Good job, girl.

53:04.006 --> 53:04.871
You all right?

53:04.873 --> 53:07.541
- I'm okay.
- You okay?

53:07.543 --> 53:08.475
I'm okay.

53:17.352 --> 53:19.753
So is everyone in your family,

53:19.755 --> 53:21.755
do they all go to church?

53:21.757 --> 53:24.324
Everyone in my family goes to church.

53:24.326 --> 53:26.761
Everyone in my family
always goes to church.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.863
And, you don't like that?

53:29.865 --> 53:33.324
No, it's good mostly.

53:33.635 --> 53:35.735
It's just it seems everyone is so busy

53:35.737 --> 53:37.771
going to church that they don't really see

53:37.773 --> 53:38.831
what's happening.

53:39.608 --> 53:40.575
Like what?

53:42.110 --> 53:43.510
You want to know why I couldn't listen

53:43.512 --> 53:45.037
to Brother Pratt this morning?

53:46.548 --> 53:49.850
It's because I already
know about Devil's Gate.

53:49.852 --> 53:51.081
I've been there.

53:58.126 --> 54:01.394
Sister Hanson, Brother
Pratt, Susan's sick.

54:07.569 --> 54:08.768
Susan?

54:08.770 --> 54:11.571
Susan, can you hear me?

54:11.573 --> 54:12.973
Lehi, go get some juice.

54:12.975 --> 54:14.773
It's in a cooler in the truck.

54:15.944 --> 54:18.645
Okay, Susan, all
right just take it easy.

54:18.647 --> 54:19.546
You'll be alright.

54:19.548 --> 54:21.516
Hand me the bag, check her meter.

54:23.051 --> 54:24.517
Let's get her up.

54:29.458 --> 54:30.457
Take that.

54:30.459 --> 54:31.949
I'll help you out.

54:32.427 --> 54:33.656
Okay, all right.

54:35.564 --> 54:36.897
Okay, you're low.

54:36.899 --> 54:37.991
Juice'll help.

54:38.934 --> 54:39.833
I'm okay.

54:40.736 --> 54:42.002
Sure, you are.

54:42.004 --> 54:43.770
We'll have her on her feet in no time.

54:43.772 --> 54:45.839
This just happens sometimes.

54:45.841 --> 54:48.141
I'll be all right in just a minute.

54:48.143 --> 54:49.142
You'll be fine.

54:49.144 --> 54:51.645
What are you talking about?

54:51.647 --> 54:53.672
She's gotta go home, man.

54:54.983 --> 54:56.783
She'll be all right,
Tom, she'll be all right.

54:56.785 --> 54:58.952
No, this is stupid!

54:58.954 --> 55:00.654
Let's all just keep walking till nobody

55:00.656 --> 55:02.088
can think straight, and then maybe we'll

55:02.090 --> 55:03.723
all be so confused that
we'll actually think

55:03.725 --> 55:04.891
we're feeling the spirit!

55:04.893 --> 55:05.759
That's enough, Tom.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.661
That is if we're lucky
enough to be feeling anything

55:07.663 --> 55:10.098
at all, not just drop dead first!

55:10.999 --> 55:12.699
No one's dying here, all right?

55:12.701 --> 55:16.433
Okay, let's just,
everyone, take a breath.

55:16.939 --> 55:19.806
Hey you guys, I'm okay.

55:20.142 --> 55:21.007
That's great.

55:21.009 --> 55:22.101
That's just...

55:24.846 --> 55:25.972
I'm outta here.

55:27.015 --> 55:29.143
Nobody's makin' you stay, Tom.

55:29.518 --> 55:30.952
You want to go, go.

55:37.059 --> 55:38.959
Susan, maybe you should go home too.

55:38.961 --> 55:41.561
No, I'm having so much fun.

55:41.563 --> 55:44.464
I just let my blood sugar
get too low, that's all.

55:44.599 --> 55:46.666
I never get to do anything.

55:46.668 --> 55:48.068
You're not gonna make me leave.

55:48.070 --> 55:48.969
Oh, that's great.

55:48.971 --> 55:50.236
You're as crazy as everyone else.

55:50.238 --> 55:51.237
Shut up, Tom!

55:51.239 --> 55:52.639
You don't know how I'm feeling!

55:52.641 --> 55:54.207
This isn't about you!

55:54.209 --> 55:56.509
All right, just cut it out.

55:56.511 --> 56:00.539
Let's just calm down here.

56:04.019 --> 56:07.787
Okay Susan, you can stay,
but I think you should

56:07.789 --> 56:09.889
ride with me in the
truck for a little while.

56:09.891 --> 56:12.588
In an hour, we'll test your
blood and see where you're at.

56:13.662 --> 56:14.493
Okay.

56:16.832 --> 56:22.566
Tom, make up your mind
what you want to do.

56:24.573 --> 56:26.239
You can wait for the Needles' truck,

56:26.241 --> 56:28.232
or you can come with us right now.

56:29.745 --> 56:35.775
Or, you can stay and pull
your share of the weight.

56:36.284 --> 56:38.753
I'm just gonna drive
you up to the dinner camp.

56:40.088 --> 56:42.188
I'm sorry, everyone.

56:42.190 --> 56:44.657
I apologize for raising my voice.

56:44.659 --> 56:46.855
Come on everyone, let's get going.

56:47.763 --> 56:50.530
When are you gonna stop
beating yourself up, man?

57:00.842 --> 57:03.176
So I'm guessing that
was about last summer.

57:03.178 --> 57:08.947
Yeah, Tom's not usually like that.

57:10.752 --> 57:13.517
Till that trip last summer,
he was like my big brother.

57:37.345 --> 57:39.712
Do you think the
water's gonna be anything

57:39.714 --> 57:41.546
like it was yesterday?

57:42.250 --> 57:44.851
Bobby, that's why we came here.

57:44.853 --> 57:46.947
Oh yeah.

57:48.256 --> 57:49.722
Don't worry, man.

57:49.724 --> 57:51.791
I'm gonna get you through this.

57:51.793 --> 57:53.660
Promise?

57:53.662 --> 57:55.687
Yeah, I promise.

57:58.366 --> 57:59.699
All right, listen up everyone.

57:59.701 --> 58:00.700
Today's gonna be a little bit different

58:00.702 --> 58:01.634
than it was yesterday.

58:01.636 --> 58:02.702
The water's gonna be a little faster,

58:02.704 --> 58:03.903
and the rapids are gonna
be a little bit bigger.

58:03.905 --> 58:06.973
Translation, today's
gonna be a lot more fun.

58:06.975 --> 58:08.942
Exactly, three laws of the river.

58:08.944 --> 58:10.977
Never leave the boat,
never let go of the paddle,

58:10.979 --> 58:12.278
never stop paddling.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.346
Say it with me.

58:13.348 --> 58:15.849
Never leave
the boat, never let go

58:15.851 --> 58:18.151
of the paddle, never stop paddling.

58:18.153 --> 58:20.386
All right guys, life helmets,
life jackets, let's go.

58:20.388 --> 58:22.220
Alright, guys.

58:25.994 --> 58:32.058
Hey you guys, I'm sorry
about going off like that.

58:34.069 --> 58:34.900
I'm just...

58:36.738 --> 58:37.937
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

58:37.939 --> 58:39.668
but I thought it was brave.

58:41.910 --> 58:43.343
It's not easy to stand up to someone

58:43.345 --> 58:45.678
especially when they're leaders like that.

58:45.680 --> 58:48.882
Even if I made a total idiot of myself?

58:48.884 --> 58:50.950
No, Anna's right.

58:50.952 --> 58:53.717
Everybody knows you were
just thinking about...

58:56.358 --> 59:00.955
Thinking about what, about Kent?

59:04.099 --> 59:08.161
Yeah, I guess I was.

59:11.306 --> 59:13.039
But, I still shouldn't
of yelled like that,

59:13.041 --> 59:14.634
so I'm sorry.

59:16.211 --> 59:18.339
That's not what you
should apologize for, Tom.

59:19.981 --> 59:21.447
It's not?

59:21.449 --> 59:22.280
Nope.

59:23.752 --> 59:27.153
What you should apologize for
was when you almost left us

59:27.155 --> 59:29.289
to pull that freaking
handcart up a mountain.

59:29.291 --> 59:30.190
Remember that?

59:32.060 --> 59:32.891
Shoot.

59:38.133 --> 59:39.766
You guys hear that?

59:42.437 --> 59:44.270
Let's go see what it is.

59:55.417 --> 59:57.150
All right, that was wonderful.

59:57.152 --> 01:00:00.486
Listen, no pioneers day
was done without kicking up

01:00:00.488 --> 01:00:02.889
a little dust before the end of the day.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.291
So brothers, I see a lot of
wonderful sisters out there.

01:00:05.293 --> 01:00:08.161
So grab a partner before
they're all taken.

01:00:08.163 --> 01:00:09.028
Let's go.

01:00:13.134 --> 01:00:16.369
So nobody told me
Mormons like to have fun.

01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:17.237
I know.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:19.305
It's shocking, isn't it.

01:00:19.307 --> 01:00:20.173
Yeah.

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:23.376
You want to dance?

01:00:23.378 --> 01:00:24.209
Sure.

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:29.782
Do you want to dance, Amanda?

01:00:29.784 --> 01:00:30.450
It's boring.

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:31.351
It'll work.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:33.987
Hey Amanda, do you want to dance?

01:00:33.989 --> 01:00:34.854
Sure.

01:00:34.856 --> 01:00:36.155
Come on.

01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:59.479
Well I got a burning in
my bosom that tells me

01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:02.015
if a guy wants to score something,

01:01:02.017 --> 01:01:04.349
you guys are the ones to talk to.

01:01:10.058 --> 01:01:10.957
Am I right?

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:15.292
Okay, okay.

01:01:16.398 --> 01:01:17.991
What can I get for this?

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.040
Dude, it's good for 50 meters underwater.

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:28.373
It's gotta be worth something.

01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:42.388
Have you seen Sterling?

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.890
Oh well, Sister Bartlett
told him that he was

01:01:43.892 --> 01:01:45.458
supposed to clean up dinner tonight,

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.521
but I don't know where he
went, so I had to do it.

01:01:52.901 --> 01:01:55.029
So how's your video going?

01:01:55.236 --> 01:01:56.169
It's going good.

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:58.871
I mean kind of hard
when you only have footage

01:01:58.873 --> 01:02:03.609
of people walking, walking,
and just more walking.

01:02:03.611 --> 01:02:06.979
But, I did get this pretty
cool shot of Brother Crabbe

01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:08.948
as the angel of death.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:10.450
Yeah, he was born to play that part.

01:02:13.121 --> 01:02:16.421
Hey, you know I think your
YouTube channel's pretty cool.

01:02:17.592 --> 01:02:18.591
You watch it?

01:02:18.593 --> 01:02:20.426
Yeah, I mean I love that
one where you have the dog,

01:02:20.428 --> 01:02:21.861
and you got it on a snowmobile.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.563
How did you get it to do that?

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:25.198
Funny story with that.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.999
So I got dog food, right?

01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:30.198
And, I just smeared it
all over the seat, and...

01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:34.640
Do you just want to dance, Marsha?

01:02:34.642 --> 01:02:36.109
Yeah sure.

01:02:36.111 --> 01:02:38.044
You gotta be careful though
when you dance out here

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.879
'cause my sister Jill when she did trek,

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:43.149
she danced into a cow
pie the size of Orem.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.373
That's amazing.

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.611
Samoans rock!

01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:17.116
Thank you.

01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:23.954
So what about you, Anna?

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.656
What about me?

01:03:28.463 --> 01:03:31.455
I don't know, why are you really here?

01:03:33.234 --> 01:03:36.169
I told you I was visiting Amanda.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:38.671
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:38.673 --> 01:03:42.175
You just planned a visit while your cousin

01:03:42.177 --> 01:03:46.410
was going on this three
day trek in the desert.

01:03:52.554 --> 01:03:55.580
I'm here because my
parents are getting a divorce.

01:03:58.259 --> 01:04:01.991
They ignore each other all
day, and they scream all night.

01:04:04.032 --> 01:04:07.093
I figured if I was
going to feel all alone,

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.036
it'd be easier without all the screaming.

01:04:12.106 --> 01:04:12.937
Oh.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.141
I'm sorry.

01:04:19.013 --> 01:04:21.107
I'm going to school next month anyway.

01:04:24.619 --> 01:04:29.489
It's just hard finding out that something

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.256
you really believed in isn't
what you thought it was.

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:40.033
Yeah, I know what that's like.

01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:57.551
Oh yeah.

01:05:04.592 --> 01:05:06.526
It's so good.

01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:24.344
Thank you.

01:05:25.813 --> 01:05:27.213
Thank you everybody.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:29.048
It's now time to get some sleep.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.483
Go back to your campsites.

01:05:30.485 --> 01:05:31.611
Goodnight.

01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:35.120
Goodnight, Tom.

01:05:41.262 --> 01:05:43.094
Hey Brother Pratt.

01:05:48.202 --> 01:05:50.836
I'm really sorry about earlier.

01:05:50.838 --> 01:05:53.535
Tom, I'm sorry too.

01:05:54.509 --> 01:05:59.312
What do you say we just
forget about it, shall we?

01:05:59.314 --> 01:06:00.513
Yeah.

01:06:00.515 --> 01:06:01.581
Goodnight.

01:06:22.804 --> 01:06:23.635
Oh.

01:06:33.815 --> 01:06:35.448
Marsha?

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.829
A skunk just licked me in the face!

01:06:53.401 --> 01:06:54.700
It's not funny.

01:07:04.879 --> 01:07:07.644
Oh no, ding it and dang it, no.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.150
Shoot!

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.922
All right everyone, last day!

01:07:16.924 --> 01:07:18.392
Let's go!

01:07:20.361 --> 01:07:21.351
Looking good.

01:08:00.468 --> 01:08:01.701
Everything all right?

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:02.768
Right as rain.

01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:05.204
Listen, we're gonna drive
on back to the trail head,

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.972
make sure the trail's shipshape.

01:08:06.974 --> 01:08:08.340
You all right with that?

01:08:08.342 --> 01:08:09.275
Sounds good.

01:08:09.677 --> 01:08:10.906
See you tonight.

01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:16.582
Don't touch poison ivy.

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:18.384
Don't touch that.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.551
Don't touch it.

01:08:26.627 --> 01:08:28.394
My leg, my leg, my leg.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.495
Oh my heck Sterling.

01:08:29.497 --> 01:08:31.330
This happened to my cousin
when he was on trek.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:32.564
His ankle swelled up like a balloon

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:34.233
and then turned a color
that our mouth gets

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.234
when you eat too many grape popsicles.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.903
Marsha, you don't need
to be doing this right now.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:40.430
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.675
All right Sterling, what happened?

01:08:42.676 --> 01:08:44.009
I just fell on the ground.

01:08:44.011 --> 01:08:45.611
I twisted my ankle really bad.

01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:47.513
I blacked out, and I don't know.

01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:48.481
I just woke up on the ground.

01:08:48.483 --> 01:08:49.348
And, it hurts.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.015
It hurts.

01:08:50.017 --> 01:08:50.883
It hurts.

01:08:50.885 --> 01:08:51.751
It hurts really bad.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:52.718
All right, let me see.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.586
Let me see.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.020
- Is it this leg?
- Yes.

01:08:55.022 --> 01:08:55.921
Okay.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:57.456
This one?

01:08:57.457 --> 01:08:58.890
Yep.

01:08:58.893 --> 01:09:00.826
Okay, yeah no.

01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:02.828
Don't, don't, don't touch the shoe.

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:03.796
It's gonna blow up like a balloon.

01:09:03.798 --> 01:09:04.764
Don't touch the shoe.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.398
It's fine.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:07.733
This ankle?

01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:10.435
Okay don't that's really hurting.

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:11.437
Just put me in the truck.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.537
Just put me the truck
and give me a Twinkie.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.606
Just give me a Twinkie
and put me in the truck.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:14.473
I'll be fine.

01:09:14.475 --> 01:09:15.341
In the truck?

01:09:15.343 --> 01:09:16.008
Okay, right.

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.876
All right.

01:09:16.877 --> 01:09:18.844
Hey guys, could you help lift Sterling

01:09:18.845 --> 01:09:21.346
into the truck please?

01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:22.715
Whoa, stop, stop!

01:09:22.716 --> 01:09:23.616
Don't move.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:27.553
Okay Sterling, shush, Sterling.

01:09:27.555 --> 01:09:31.856
Okay, don't move a muscle.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.593
There's a rattle snake.

01:09:34.595 --> 01:09:36.395
No shush, don't breathe.

01:09:36.397 --> 01:09:37.023
Shush.

01:09:38.698 --> 01:09:39.859
All right just.

01:09:41.068 --> 01:09:42.968
Sterling, Sterling, listen.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.705
Slowly, slowly turn
your head to the right.

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:47.907
Slowly turn your head to the fight.

01:09:47.908 --> 01:09:49.875
I don't want to hit you with this.

01:09:49.877 --> 01:09:50.943
Oh Sterling, watch out!

01:09:55.416 --> 01:09:57.016
That was too easy.

01:09:57.018 --> 01:09:58.484
I'm glad you're okay, Sterling.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:09:59.652
What was that Brother Pratt?

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:01.487
His ankle will be fine.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:02.955
That's not funny.

01:10:02.957 --> 01:10:05.391
Come on guys, I think
it's time for Sterling

01:10:05.393 --> 01:10:07.059
to pull the cart by himself!

01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:08.360
Come on.

01:10:08.362 --> 01:10:10.029
Oh no, come on, it was a joke.

01:10:10.031 --> 01:10:11.397
Yeah well, it wasn't funny.

01:10:11.399 --> 01:10:12.097
It was funny.

01:10:12.099 --> 01:10:13.098
I thought it was funny.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.600
No, it wasn't, Sterling.

01:10:14.602 --> 01:10:15.668
Go!

01:10:29.984 --> 01:10:31.851
I bet there's gonna
be a big turkey dinner

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.686
once we get back to camp.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:35.387
I'm gonna eat so much food.

01:10:35.389 --> 01:10:37.122
I'm gonna stand up
straight, and then I'm going

01:10:37.124 --> 01:10:38.457
to throw up.

01:10:39.794 --> 01:10:41.493
I don't think that's quite the point

01:10:41.495 --> 01:10:42.428
of this experience, Brad.

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:43.397
Hey are you okay?

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:46.498
Sister Hanson, Sister Hanson!

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.934
I think Susan's sick again.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.636
You're gonna be alright.

01:11:00.748 --> 01:11:02.882
All right, this has slowed
you down a little bit,

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.618
but the Needles are bringing
up the read in their truck.

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.919
No problem.

01:11:06.921 --> 01:11:09.720
We'll need to get Susan back which means

01:11:10.524 --> 01:11:12.686
you're in charge Tom for real.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.760
I got it.

01:11:19.533 --> 01:11:22.001
Drink lots of water, and
we'll see you at dinner.

01:11:22.003 --> 01:11:22.970
All right.

01:11:23.871 --> 01:11:25.137
Okay.

01:11:25.139 --> 01:11:26.038
Good to go.

01:11:27.441 --> 01:11:29.034
You're going to be alright.

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:34.780
We'll see ya.

01:11:40.688 --> 01:11:43.749
Well, let's go.

01:11:50.831 --> 01:11:52.097
What are you doing?

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:54.500
He took my spot.

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:11.951
Whoa, whoa guys, stop the cart.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:13.978
Listen, do you hear that?

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:22.930
Tom?

01:12:24.198 --> 01:12:25.931
You know what I'm thinking?

01:12:25.933 --> 01:12:27.232
You guys, I don't know.

01:12:27.234 --> 01:12:28.534
It'll be 10 minutes.

01:12:28.536 --> 01:12:29.201
It'll be quick.

01:12:29.203 --> 01:12:30.669
Yeah, just put the cart right there.

01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:31.804
You can see the trail from there.

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.139
Let's go, let's go.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.840
Okay you guys, we better get going.

01:13:11.612 --> 01:13:13.102
Five more minutes.

01:13:15.783 --> 01:13:17.877
Yeah, five more minutes.

01:13:50.317 --> 01:13:52.551
All right, I gotta get
Susan off this mountain.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:53.652
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

01:13:53.654 --> 01:13:54.319
You got everything under control?

01:13:54.321 --> 01:13:55.187
Yeah.

01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:56.121
Alright, I'm grabbing a couple things.

01:13:56.123 --> 01:13:57.790
Make sure she's ready to go.

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:59.158
I'm gonna go try to find something

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.292
more substantial to eat, okay?

01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:01.762
Thank you.

01:14:02.029 --> 01:14:03.028
You poor, poor thing.

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:04.191
Here, lay down.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.865
She is hot.

01:14:06.867 --> 01:14:08.835
Here, this might help.

01:14:18.712 --> 01:14:19.543
Here.

01:14:20.347 --> 01:14:21.314
There we go.

01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:26.618
Okay.

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.248
Seriously guys, that
turkey's not coming to us.

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:32.015
Mmm, turkey.

01:14:34.161 --> 01:14:35.959
I think I can smell it from here.

01:14:37.364 --> 01:14:39.128
Let's go, let's go.

01:14:42.736 --> 01:14:44.830
Come on, come on, come on.

01:14:51.378 --> 01:14:55.645
Man, I cannot wait to sleep in my own bed.

01:14:55.916 --> 01:14:57.616
No rocks.

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:58.984
No bugs.

01:14:58.986 --> 01:15:00.719
No, Lehi snoring.

01:15:00.721 --> 01:15:02.054
I do not snore.

01:15:02.056 --> 01:15:04.790
Lehi, you snore like a goat with a cold.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.758
Oh come on, you gotta be kidding.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.794
It's true, it's true.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:10.262
That's ridiculous.

01:15:10.264 --> 01:15:13.098
Hey Tom, how far did Brother Pratt say

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.966
we were from the last camp?

01:15:15.369 --> 01:15:16.803
He didn't say.

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:21.206
When was the last time
anyone saw a cow skull?

01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:23.408
I haven't seen one of those since...

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:24.969
Since the creek.

01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:37.990
They were so dirty by the third day

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:40.859
that when they got out of
the shower, it was like...

01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:07.019
Has anyone seen any wheel ruts?

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:08.387
Well, the ground's
been pretty hard packed

01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:09.855
right here, so we
probably wouldn't see it.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:11.190
It's too dark to see anything.

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:12.424
It can't be much further.

01:16:12.426 --> 01:16:14.159
Let's just keep going.

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:20.999
I'll
tell ya, the butterflies

01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:24.096
in the Venezuelan
rainforest are astounding.

01:16:24.838 --> 01:16:29.674
Big as your hand, gorgeous colors,

01:16:30.277 --> 01:16:37.183
reds, yellows, blues, almost
as brilliant as your eyes.

01:16:41.288 --> 01:16:42.154
Water?

01:16:42.156 --> 01:16:43.488
Thank you.

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:44.321
Water?

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:55.464
Ow, ow.

01:16:57.471 --> 01:16:58.503
Are you okay?

01:16:58.505 --> 01:17:00.940
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

01:17:02.276 --> 01:17:03.835
Can you walk?

01:17:06.313 --> 01:17:07.346
Come on then, let's go.

01:17:07.348 --> 01:17:08.213
Tom.

01:17:08.215 --> 01:17:09.081
Tom?

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:09.948
We need to talk.

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.216
About what?

01:17:11.218 --> 01:17:13.018
What do you want to talk about, Brad?

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.353
We just need to decide...

01:17:14.355 --> 01:17:15.447
Decide what?

01:17:17.124 --> 01:17:18.421
What that we're lost?

01:17:19.326 --> 01:17:21.294
Okay yeah, maybe we are.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:24.997
The only thing we can
do now is to keep going

01:17:25.165 --> 01:17:27.327
and look for some light, so let's go.

01:17:27.968 --> 01:17:29.501
I'm really cold.

01:17:29.503 --> 01:17:31.972
Look, you're gonna be alright.

01:17:32.306 --> 01:17:35.037
Susan didn't leave
any food behind did she?

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:38.370
Look, we're going to be fine.

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:41.446
We've just gotta keep going.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:42.415
Now come on.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.126
Wendell?

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.827
Hey, you didn't happen
to see Tom Jensen's group

01:17:55.829 --> 01:17:57.896
at the end of the line, did you?

01:17:57.898 --> 01:17:59.064
Nah.

01:17:59.066 --> 01:18:01.763
We were way back behind the last group.

01:18:01.935 --> 01:18:03.568
I didn't see anybody.

01:18:12.946 --> 01:18:15.514
Come on you guys,
just a few more feet.

01:18:15.516 --> 01:18:18.486
You set down, put it down.

01:18:18.552 --> 01:18:20.247
Get a rock.

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.322
Brake the wheels.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:24.189
You got it?

01:18:24.191 --> 01:18:26.191
- We're good.
- Hang on.

01:18:26.193 --> 01:18:28.060
- Okay, we're good.
- Got it?

01:18:34.401 --> 01:18:36.301
Where are the lights?

01:18:37.971 --> 01:18:40.906
Where are the lights, Tom?

01:18:40.908 --> 01:18:43.008
It can't be much further.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.344
Look, there's a ridge up that way.

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.346
I bet we can see the camp from up there.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.881
You want to go all the way up there?

01:18:49.883 --> 01:18:51.283
Do you want to
find the camp or not?

01:18:51.285 --> 01:18:53.118
Tom, for all you know,
we could've been going

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.986
in the opposite direction.

01:18:54.988 --> 01:18:56.254
We could see Colorado from up there.

01:18:56.256 --> 01:18:57.923
No, no, we're not that far off.

01:18:57.925 --> 01:18:59.424
You don't know everything, Tom.

01:18:59.426 --> 01:19:00.425
Yeah well, I know enough to keep

01:19:00.427 --> 01:19:02.327
from tripping over my own feet, Lehi.

01:19:02.329 --> 01:19:03.195
Tom.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:06.098
You know what, forget
you man, all fight.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.432
I'm going back to the trail.

01:19:07.434 --> 01:19:08.867
I'm right behind you, bro.

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.268
Come on, hey stop.

01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:11.169
- Stop!
- Get off me!

01:19:11.171 --> 01:19:12.404
Tom.

01:19:12.406 --> 01:19:14.539
Lehi, get back here, Lehi.

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:15.407
Shut up!

01:19:15.409 --> 01:19:16.408
Way to go, Tom.

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:17.275
Way to go!

01:19:17.277 --> 01:19:19.111
We've gotta stay
together, Lehi, come on!

01:19:19.113 --> 01:19:20.612
So we can listen to
you complain all night?

01:19:20.614 --> 01:19:21.480
Yeah, no thank you.

01:19:21.482 --> 01:19:22.647
Shut up, Lehi!

01:19:22.649 --> 01:19:23.515
You're not the boss, Tom!

01:19:23.517 --> 01:19:24.383
Yes, I am.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:25.550
Brother Pratt told me
right before we left.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:27.519
Yeah, and you've done a fantastic job

01:19:27.521 --> 01:19:28.487
so far, haven't you?

01:19:28.489 --> 01:19:29.921
I told you to shut up, Brad.

01:19:29.923 --> 01:19:31.556
Do you realize that people are gonna die

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:32.657
because of what you're doing?

01:19:32.659 --> 01:19:33.992
I said shut your mouth.

01:19:35.929 --> 01:19:36.595
Guys!

01:19:36.597 --> 01:19:37.529
Guys, the cart!

01:19:37.531 --> 01:19:38.397
Lehi!

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:39.664
The cart!

01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:41.133
Lehi, look out!

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:44.436
Lehi.

01:19:48.675 --> 01:19:51.109
No, no, no.

01:20:12.232 --> 01:20:13.666
On three.

01:20:25.312 --> 01:20:26.511
Bobby!

01:20:29.216 --> 01:20:30.215
Don't do it!

01:20:30.217 --> 01:20:31.184
Don't do it!

01:20:33.353 --> 01:20:34.184
Kent!

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.122
Kent no.

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:45.397
Here take it.

01:20:45.399 --> 01:20:46.631
We can do this.

01:21:06.019 --> 01:21:06.685
You okay?

01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:07.552
Where's Kent?

01:21:07.554 --> 01:21:08.420
Where's Kent?

01:21:08.422 --> 01:21:10.121
I don't know.

01:21:10.123 --> 01:21:11.089
I am so sorry.

01:21:11.091 --> 01:21:12.057
Do you see him?

01:21:12.059 --> 01:21:13.291
Anyone got eyes on Kent.

01:21:13.293 --> 01:21:14.326
Grab your paddles.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:17.093
There he is, there he is!

01:22:48.221 --> 01:22:49.245
Lehi, Lehi!

01:22:51.158 --> 01:22:53.092
Lehi, talk to me.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.455
Talk to me.

01:22:54.561 --> 01:22:55.427
He's alive.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:57.095
He's alive, hey, hey, hey.

01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:58.229
Where does it hurt?

01:22:58.231 --> 01:22:59.831
Everywhere.

01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:13.244
Hey guys, listen up please.

01:23:13.246 --> 01:23:15.681
Has anybody see Tom Jensen's group?

01:23:17.651 --> 01:23:18.482
Anybody?

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:24.856
All right if you haven't
heard back from us

01:23:24.858 --> 01:23:26.725
in two hours, call the county sheriff

01:23:26.727 --> 01:23:29.260
about getting a search
team up here, all right?

01:23:29.262 --> 01:23:30.328
All right.

01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:31.830
Everyone, good luck.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.143
He doesn't look so good.

01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:47.113
He's half in shock right now.

01:23:47.247 --> 01:23:48.713
We need to get a fire started.

01:23:48.715 --> 01:23:50.582
Who's got some matches?

01:23:50.584 --> 01:23:52.917
Brad, don't you have some matches?

01:23:52.919 --> 01:23:55.520
There's like two left.

01:23:55.522 --> 01:23:58.548
All right, well we're gonna
have to make do with these.

01:23:58.859 --> 01:24:00.358
Let's gather some stuff to make a fire.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.727
The sage is still green,
so don't use that.

01:24:02.729 --> 01:24:05.230
Look for things like you
know paper or dry grass.

01:24:05.232 --> 01:24:06.631
You know anything to start a fire.

01:24:06.633 --> 01:24:10.467
Tom, Tom, what about the cart?

01:24:14.207 --> 01:24:16.775
Oh, I am going to enjoy this.

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:36.822
Tom?

01:24:37.764 --> 01:24:38.595
Tom?

01:24:40.934 --> 01:24:43.835
Do you think maybe we ought
to pray before we try this?

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:52.572
Yeah, okay.

01:24:53.413 --> 01:24:54.312
Brad, will you say the prayer?

01:24:54.314 --> 01:24:59.377
You do it, Tom.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.422
Lisa, would you mind saying the prayer?

01:25:04.424 --> 01:25:05.423
Tom.

01:25:05.425 --> 01:25:06.524
Lehi?

01:25:06.526 --> 01:25:08.358
I want you to do it.

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:38.417
Father in heaven,

01:25:47.834 --> 01:25:53.967
Father in heaven, if you're out there,

01:25:56.042 --> 01:25:57.669
if you can hear this,

01:26:02.482 --> 01:26:04.314
we're in trouble here.

01:26:07.387 --> 01:26:08.479
It's my fault.

01:26:13.994 --> 01:26:15.484
This is my fault.

01:26:18.899 --> 01:26:20.832
But, that is no reason that these guys

01:26:20.834 --> 01:26:22.928
should have to pay for it.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.464
We need help.

01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:32.307
We can't do this on our own.

01:26:38.018 --> 01:26:39.383
Come on, Tom.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.010
You know what to do.

01:26:49.029 --> 01:26:53.364
We need to be found, Heavenly Father.

01:26:56.369 --> 01:26:57.393
We need to be

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:04.834
seen.

01:27:09.449 --> 01:27:10.075
Seen.

01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:18.849
This isn't right, we
shouldn't be down here.

01:27:21.828 --> 01:27:23.494
We need to be up there.

01:27:23.496 --> 01:27:25.129
We need to move this.

01:27:30.604 --> 01:27:31.603
Set him down.

01:27:31.605 --> 01:27:33.369
Stop please.

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:39.878
Lehi, let's never do that again.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.814
You think that was bad?

01:27:42.782 --> 01:27:45.547
I'm 30 pounds lighter now
than I was on Thursday.

01:28:19.452 --> 01:28:20.652
Wait, wait, wait, hold on!

01:28:20.654 --> 01:28:21.951
Don't light that!

01:28:31.965 --> 01:28:37.927
Father in heaven, we have
some kids lost out here tonight.

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.008
I need your help.

01:28:45.712 --> 01:28:47.078
Please.

01:28:52.786 --> 01:28:54.152
Now, we're talking.

01:28:54.154 --> 01:28:55.553
Okay, try that.

01:28:55.555 --> 01:28:56.754
Light that up.

01:29:13.039 --> 01:29:13.905
Feel that?

01:29:13.907 --> 01:29:14.999
Bobby!

01:29:24.517 --> 01:29:25.575
Okay.

01:29:26.786 --> 01:29:28.519
That works.

01:29:28.521 --> 01:29:29.988
Thank you.

01:29:36.596 --> 01:29:37.961
One, two, three.

01:29:42.235 --> 01:29:44.966
So what do Mormons do
when you get in trouble?

01:29:45.905 --> 01:29:48.033
Mostly we just eat.

01:30:00.587 --> 01:30:04.856
♪ The spirit of God ♪

01:30:04.858 --> 01:30:10.728
♪ Like a fire is burning ♪

01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:20.572
♪ The latter day glory
begins to come forth ♪

01:30:26.112 --> 01:30:27.841
Hey guys, shush.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:31.180
Do you hear that?

01:30:32.652 --> 01:30:33.851
Do you hear that?

01:30:33.853 --> 01:30:34.719
Hey!

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:36.120
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:30:36.122 --> 01:30:36.988
Hey!

01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.989
Hey!

01:30:39.192 --> 01:30:40.892
It worked.

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.326
Brother Pratt!

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:44.629
You okay?

01:30:45.832 --> 01:30:47.065
You all right?

01:31:07.187 --> 01:31:08.848
You're gonna be all right, Lehi.

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:12.590
So are you, Tom.

01:31:30.844 --> 01:31:32.176
Here you go.

01:31:32.178 --> 01:31:34.306
You know what let me grab you some water.

01:31:39.886 --> 01:31:42.787
He got the can, he sprays it.

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.755
The fire explodes.

01:31:55.235 --> 01:31:57.169
You did good out there today, Tom.

01:31:58.171 --> 01:32:03.632
I got us lost, and I
nearly got Lehi killed.

01:32:18.158 --> 01:32:20.149
Sometimes, it seems so...

01:32:25.131 --> 01:32:26.758
Do you ever feel...

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:33.169
That day on the river.

01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:41.672
I prayed so hard, Brother Pratt.

01:32:46.386 --> 01:32:49.754
I tried so hard to believe.

01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:59.722
Tom, I wish I could tell
you why Kent died that day.

01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:03.298
But, I can't.

01:33:06.172 --> 01:33:08.005
There are things that happen here

01:33:08.007 --> 01:33:11.739
that may never make sense.

01:33:15.081 --> 01:33:16.378
But, this I know.

01:33:18.985 --> 01:33:23.718
That day on the water Kent gave his life

01:33:23.923 --> 01:33:25.914
to save someone else.

01:33:27.293 --> 01:33:29.853
I mean isn't that what
we're supposed to learn,

01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:33.394
what God sent his son to show us.

01:33:36.803 --> 01:33:45.143
So when those days come,
when it doesn't make sense,

01:33:46.446 --> 01:33:52.010
when it feels so alone,
I try to remember that.

01:33:55.989 --> 01:33:57.957
And, I hope,

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:00.226
the next time,

01:34:02.996 --> 01:34:05.021
I see my son,

01:34:07.333 --> 01:34:11.429
he's as proud of me
as I am of him.

01:34:25.251 --> 01:34:28.185
So that would be plate number?

01:34:28.187 --> 01:34:31.282
This, broseph, is plate number four.

01:34:33.092 --> 01:34:37.228
Oh, hey that thing earlier did you do it?

01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:38.095
You asked?

01:34:38.097 --> 01:34:38.963
Yeah.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.990
Hi Sterling, hey scoot.

01:34:42.368 --> 01:34:43.234
Hi.

01:34:43.236 --> 01:34:44.067
Hey.

01:34:44.837 --> 01:34:47.038
All right, all right.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:47.871
Cool guys.

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:51.475
So good.

01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:58.381
Hey.

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:01.317
I'm sorry.

01:35:03.022 --> 01:35:05.184
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:07.891
We good?

01:35:09.529 --> 01:35:11.429
Yeah, we're good.

01:35:11.431 --> 01:35:13.230
All right.

01:35:13.232 --> 01:35:15.826
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:19.105 --> 01:35:20.971
Do you mind if I join?

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:22.907
Please sit down.

01:35:22.909 --> 01:35:25.241
Okay, it looked a little full.

01:35:29.115 --> 01:35:31.413
Everything tastes so good.

01:35:33.086 --> 01:35:36.852
Even the peas, I hate peas.

01:35:37.223 --> 01:35:38.589
These are incredible.

01:35:40.159 --> 01:35:44.228
It's just one crazy thing
after another out here, huh?

01:35:44.230 --> 01:35:45.197
Yeah.

01:35:47.467 --> 01:35:52.636
Yeah, speaking of crazy, what happened

01:35:52.638 --> 01:35:55.130
out there on that hill tonight, Tom?

01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:00.211
Where did that idea come from?

01:36:02.315 --> 01:36:03.908
I think,

01:36:08.955 --> 01:36:11.288
maybe we weren't as alone out there

01:36:11.290 --> 01:36:13.122
as we thought we were.

01:36:30.209 --> 01:36:32.543
There was a huge hill.

01:36:37.683 --> 01:36:39.383
I ended up using this hairspray

01:36:39.385 --> 01:36:41.652
that I found in a makeup
bag to start the fire.

01:36:41.654 --> 01:36:43.587
We had like one match left.

01:36:43.589 --> 01:36:44.522
We were so worried.

01:36:44.524 --> 01:36:45.990
Hey guys.

01:36:45.992 --> 01:36:46.891
You came!

01:36:47.627 --> 01:36:49.493
I was so worried about you.

01:36:55.701 --> 01:36:57.168
I'm glad you guys are home.

01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:58.269
- Yeah.
- Group hug.

01:36:58.271 --> 01:37:00.137
- Oh group hug
- Good to see you, yes.

01:37:00.139 --> 01:37:02.106
Oh Tom, you smell so bad.

01:37:03.476 --> 01:37:05.176
You guys stink so bad.

01:37:05.178 --> 01:37:06.339
That is... ew.

01:37:11.717 --> 01:37:14.418
Oh okay,
put it away and give me a hug.

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.053
Come on.

01:37:16.055 --> 01:37:17.054
I'm gonna miss you, Carol.

01:37:17.056 --> 01:37:18.656
I'll
miss you too, good job.

01:37:18.658 --> 01:37:19.523
Thank you, I tried.

01:37:19.525 --> 01:37:20.357
You did it.

01:37:20.359 --> 01:37:21.225
You did it, right?

01:37:21.227 --> 01:37:22.092
- I thought I was gonna die.
- Didn't think you could.

01:37:22.094 --> 01:37:23.427
Oh there you go.

01:37:23.429 --> 01:37:24.328
How does it feel?

01:37:24.330 --> 01:37:25.663
You are now in the camera.

01:37:25.665 --> 01:37:27.360
Hey Brother Pratt.

01:37:28.701 --> 01:37:31.702
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:37:31.704 --> 01:37:33.304
You're welcome.

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:34.305
You should come over some time.

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:36.140
Cindy would love to see you.

01:37:36.142 --> 01:37:38.275
Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

01:37:38.277 --> 01:37:39.244
Thank you.

01:37:57.163 --> 01:37:59.393
Been a pleasure, Sister Bartlett.

01:38:00.533 --> 01:38:02.501
Goodbye Brother Crabbe.

01:38:05.204 --> 01:38:08.739
Sister Bartlett, I
was wondering if perhaps

01:38:08.741 --> 01:38:10.641
you'd care to join me in my home

01:38:10.643 --> 01:38:13.577
for a scripture study some Sunday evening.

01:38:13.579 --> 01:38:16.071
Oh, I'd probably be up, oh.

01:38:19.285 --> 01:38:20.116
Oh.

01:38:20.786 --> 01:38:21.981
Oh.

01:38:22.455 --> 01:38:24.288
Oh, I look horrible.

01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:26.457
Oh my gosh, don't look at me.

01:38:26.459 --> 01:38:27.324
Turn away.

01:38:27.326 --> 01:38:28.691
Stop it, please.

01:38:31.564 --> 01:38:35.666
You are the most lovely, most striking,

01:38:35.668 --> 01:38:39.603
sensitive, tender
creature I have ever seen.

01:39:02.194 --> 01:39:05.763
All right, Brother Crabbe,
you want to knock that off?

01:39:13.472 --> 01:39:14.505
Here you are.

01:39:14.507 --> 01:39:15.339
Thank you.

01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:16.604
You're welcome.

01:39:17.843 --> 01:39:20.144
This belongs to you.

01:39:20.146 --> 01:39:21.145
It does.

01:39:21.147 --> 01:39:22.846
Another adventure in the books, huh?

01:39:22.848 --> 01:39:24.214
I'll see you Sunday.

01:39:24.216 --> 01:39:25.683
You two, be good.

01:39:28.854 --> 01:39:30.618
One heck of a vacation, huh?

01:39:31.791 --> 01:39:36.695
Yeah, let's see I
got seven new blisters.

01:39:37.363 --> 01:39:40.097
I got to see a compound fracture up close,

01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:42.566
and I ate quite possibly
the best turkey dinner

01:39:42.568 --> 01:39:45.436
that's ever been cooked
on the face of the planet.

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:48.606
So not bad for a long weekend.

01:39:48.608 --> 01:39:51.077
Yeah no, that's not bad.

01:39:52.445 --> 01:39:54.709
Well hey,

01:39:57.516 --> 01:39:59.316
it was nice to meet you.

01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:06.423
Maybe I'll see you around in the fall.

01:40:06.425 --> 01:40:07.491
What?

01:40:07.493 --> 01:40:11.662
Oh the school I'm going
to to study journalism,

01:40:11.664 --> 01:40:13.597
it's this private school.

01:40:13.599 --> 01:40:16.330
It's actually broadcast journalism.

01:40:16.602 --> 01:40:18.235
I don't know maybe you've heard of it.

01:40:18.237 --> 01:40:20.103
It's called Brigham Young University.

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.539
Oh.

01:40:22.541 --> 01:40:24.305
You mean you're going...

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:38.355
You know Provo's just down the road.

01:40:38.357 --> 01:40:41.625
Shauna, slow down!

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.699
Sterling?

01:41:24.303 --> 01:41:24.929
Sterling?

01:41:25.971 --> 01:41:26.970
Sterling?

01:41:26.972 --> 01:41:28.205
What are you doing here?

01:41:28.207 --> 01:41:29.873
Sunday school started like 10 minutes ago.

01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:30.741
Yeah, I know.

01:41:30.743 --> 01:41:32.711
Sunday school's for losers.

01:41:33.512 --> 01:41:34.978
Fine.

01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.814
Let's do it the hard way.

01:41:43.255 --> 01:41:47.224
Thanks guys, the worth of
the soul is great, even his.

01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:48.726
No problem.

01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:50.494
Absolutely.

01:41:55.401 --> 01:41:56.391
Oh man.

01:41:58.537 --> 01:42:00.637
All that spirituality in your pinky?

01:42:00.639 --> 01:42:03.240
This is for your entire soul, Sterling.

01:42:03.242 --> 01:42:04.608
Don't you guys need to be in like

01:42:04.610 --> 01:42:05.876
Sunday school or something?

01:42:05.878 --> 01:42:07.911
Sister Anderson sent us to find you.

01:42:07.913 --> 01:42:10.547
Relax dude, she brought us treats.

01:42:10.549 --> 01:42:11.715
You didn't think we were really going

01:42:11.717 --> 01:42:13.412
to keep it, did you?

01:42:18.524 --> 01:42:19.957
You guys, rock!
