WEBVTT

00:00.516 --> 00:02.110
What's up, people?

00:02.111 --> 00:04.434
You know there's unspoken
codes out there, right?

00:04.435 --> 00:07.546
For example, when somebody
shows you their ugly baby,

00:07.547 --> 00:10.982
you can't be like, "Damn,
that's an ugly ass baby!

00:10.983 --> 00:13.952
"It look like a FaceTime
with a bad Wi-Fi connection.

00:13.953 --> 00:16.487
Look, look at the baby's face,
it's still buffering."

00:17.756 --> 00:19.390
No, you gotta say,

00:19.391 --> 00:23.060
"Oh, look at the little baby.

00:23.061 --> 00:25.329
Oh, it's a baby."

00:25.330 --> 00:27.531
My point is, without these codes

00:27.532 --> 00:29.200
society would plunge into chaos.

00:29.201 --> 00:33.103
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a date with a young lady

00:33.104 --> 00:35.439
and after I mm-hmm,

00:35.440 --> 00:38.142
I'm gonna tell her
I had a wonderful time

00:38.143 --> 00:39.944
and I'm gonna call her tomorrow.

00:39.945 --> 00:41.812
Codes.

00:47.919 --> 00:53.423
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

00:56.361 --> 00:59.396
Girl, this spa day is long overdue.

00:59.397 --> 01:01.332
I'm so sorry I've been
spending so much time

01:01.333 --> 01:02.466
with Demetrius lately.

01:02.467 --> 01:04.001
- Yvette...
- Hmm?

01:04.001 --> 01:06.537
Do not apologize for being in love.

01:06.538 --> 01:08.906
I'm just glad that you're so happy.

01:08.907 --> 01:12.276
And I've been keeping busy
with my Groupon classes.

01:12.277 --> 01:13.811
Ashley, I know Demetrius

01:13.812 --> 01:16.947
and I have been on
and off again for a while

01:16.948 --> 01:20.150
but this time, it's on for good.

01:20.151 --> 01:24.388
I mean, Demetrius got me
feeling like a brand-new me.

01:24.389 --> 01:26.523
Nothing can kill this vibe.

01:26.524 --> 01:27.825
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.126
- Hey, Ash.
- Hey.

01:29.127 --> 01:31.228
Oh, hey, Yvette.

01:31.229 --> 01:33.564
Girl, I ain't seen you all month.

01:33.565 --> 01:36.834
Well, here's a montage
of greetings you missed.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.870
Hey, Grover.

01:39.871 --> 01:42.806
When did you get back
from Sesame Street?

01:42.807 --> 01:46.110
Hola, Chupacabra.

01:46.111 --> 01:49.546
Hakuna Matata, Rafiki.

01:49.547 --> 01:52.950
Hey, Ren, where's Stimpy?

01:52.951 --> 01:55.719
Hi, sidepiece of Chucky.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.756
Oh, man, I missed us.

01:58.757 --> 02:00.624
You know, I know what this is.

02:00.625 --> 02:03.027
You just can't stand to see me happy.

02:03.028 --> 02:05.362
Girl, I can't stand
to see you, period.

02:05.363 --> 02:08.264
- That's mean.
- All right, knock it off.

02:08.265 --> 02:10.868
Yvette's in love and we should
all be excited for her.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.870
- Pfft.
- Thank you.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.773
Well, love is actually
a manufactured emotion.

02:15.774 --> 02:17.508
An evolutionary fail-safe designed

02:17.509 --> 02:19.710
to trick our species into procreating.

02:19.711 --> 02:22.846
It's an illusion.

02:22.847 --> 02:26.083
Damn it, Stevie, you're such a liar.

02:26.084 --> 02:27.551
Okay, Yvette, hand me my purse.

02:27.552 --> 02:28.986
We got about 90 minutes

02:28.987 --> 02:30.754
to get to the bottom
of that bottomless brunch.

02:30.755 --> 02:32.389
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, Ash.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.291
You gotta wrap your day
of beauty up at 5:00

02:34.292 --> 02:36.093
'cause remember,
I got Laker tickets and me

02:36.094 --> 02:38.395
and Stevie are going
to the game and if you know me,

02:38.396 --> 02:40.965
you know I am a...
together: Laker hater.

02:40.966 --> 02:43.801
Oh, yes, and they are playing
the Golden State Warriors

02:43.802 --> 02:45.803
which means they are bound to lose.

02:45.804 --> 02:47.738
Ah...

02:47.739 --> 02:49.373
I don't like none of them.
I don't like Kobe.

02:49.374 --> 02:53.077
I don't like the coin
stuck in his throat.

02:53.078 --> 02:55.045
I don't like Shaq and his loose eye

02:55.046 --> 02:57.348
and, you know, I can't
understand a word he's saying.

02:57.349 --> 03:00.684
I can't understand
anything that he's saying.

03:00.685 --> 03:03.253
And if Lonzo Ball
is playing Steph Curry,

03:03.254 --> 03:06.991
it's gonna be light on light crime.

03:06.992 --> 03:09.893
All right, so, be back by 5:00.

03:11.863 --> 03:14.331
Demetrius.

03:14.332 --> 03:16.467
Hey, baby. Uh-huh.

03:16.468 --> 03:20.437
Lunch? Actually, Ashley and I were...

03:20.438 --> 03:21.538
I'd love to.

03:22.073 --> 03:23.513
What time do you want to pick me up?

03:24.642 --> 03:26.577
Oh my God.

03:26.578 --> 03:30.214
When he misses me, he tracks my phone.

03:30.215 --> 03:32.516
Oh, sure, when he does it, it's cute.

03:36.254 --> 03:38.522
- Hi.
- Mm, there's my boo.

03:38.523 --> 03:39.857
Both: Mm.

03:39.858 --> 03:41.291
Somebody needs to tell Demetrius

03:41.292 --> 03:43.427
he can't turn
that frog into a princess.

03:43.428 --> 03:45.229
Marlon, my man.

03:45.230 --> 03:47.231
Hey, what's going on, jail buff?

03:49.100 --> 03:51.035
Whose manhood you took this week?

03:55.640 --> 03:57.207
I like the shirt.

03:57.208 --> 04:00.110
Look like you was employee
of the month at Best Buy.

04:01.813 --> 04:03.647
Like the forklift broke

04:03.648 --> 04:06.550
and you started lifting
all the packages yourself.

04:10.055 --> 04:11.855
Oh, man, you know,
for a brother with a bunch

04:11.856 --> 04:14.992
of five star restaurants,
you sure got fast food tastes.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.494
Hey, now, look,
don't be jealous, Marlon.

04:17.495 --> 04:20.363
All right? My baby's smart, confident,

04:20.365 --> 04:23.233
funny, and not to mention
she's... damn!

04:23.234 --> 04:24.668
Mm, mm, mm.

04:24.669 --> 04:28.605
Nah.

04:28.606 --> 04:31.008
You got you a nappy meal.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.509
Don't make me hurt you, Marlon.

04:32.510 --> 04:33.677
All right, I'm sorry.

04:33.678 --> 04:36.680
I know them steroids make you crazy.

04:36.681 --> 04:38.816
All right.

04:38.817 --> 04:41.585
Ash, you're okay
with me changing our plans?

04:41.586 --> 04:44.321
Yes, go. Of course.

04:44.322 --> 04:45.489
Okay, I'll call you later.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.957
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:46.958 --> 04:48.192
- Mm-kay.
- Bye.

04:48.193 --> 04:49.259
Come on, baby.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.694
All right, Demetrius.

04:50.695 --> 04:52.396
Make sure you
have her back by midnight.

04:52.397 --> 04:54.631
There ain't no telling
what she's gonna turn into.

04:56.334 --> 04:58.869
That's a Gremlin joke.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.804
She looks like Stripe.

05:02.907 --> 05:04.274
I don't get it.

05:04.275 --> 05:06.477
What's that guy got that I don't?

05:06.478 --> 05:07.878
A job.

05:07.879 --> 05:09.746
- A house.
- A car.

05:09.747 --> 05:11.215
Savings account.

05:11.216 --> 05:13.150
It was a rhetorical question.

05:15.687 --> 05:17.154
- Marlon.
- Yeah?

05:17.155 --> 05:18.689
Can I get nachos?

05:18.690 --> 05:20.524
Negro, I ain't your daddy.

05:20.525 --> 05:22.259
Look, I already got you tickets

05:22.260 --> 05:23.961
and I bought you
that stupid foam finger

05:23.962 --> 05:25.629
that you just had to have.

05:25.630 --> 05:26.964
And I already said thank you.

05:26.965 --> 05:29.266
Boop.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.034
Oh, look, there's Demetrius.

05:31.035 --> 05:32.603
Maybe he'll buy me nachos.

05:32.604 --> 05:34.071
He owes me,

05:34.072 --> 05:36.140
as he's currently copulating
with my future boo thang.

05:36.141 --> 05:38.208
Uh, brother, I think Demetrius

05:38.209 --> 05:40.444
is a little too busy
to buy you nachos.

05:43.681 --> 05:46.717
Maybe she's his cousin.

05:46.718 --> 05:48.519
Uh...

05:48.520 --> 05:51.221
that's not how you kiss your cousin.

05:51.222 --> 05:54.224
It's not?

05:54.225 --> 05:55.894
Of course it's not.

05:58.152 --> 06:00.429
Damn, he is tasting some her.

06:00.430 --> 06:03.966
Either that, or feeding
her like a baby bird.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.668
That is shameful behavior.

06:05.669 --> 06:08.037
I should go over there
and give him a piece of my...

06:08.038 --> 06:11.340
Big D! Double D.

06:11.341 --> 06:12.841
Supporting his Lakers.

06:12.842 --> 06:14.309
- Having fun?
- Mm.

06:14.310 --> 06:16.444
We're having fun.

06:16.445 --> 06:18.947
- Charmaine, this is Marlon.
- Hey.

06:18.948 --> 06:20.448
- And Stevie.
- Hey.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.183
I didn't know
you guys were Lakers fans.

06:22.184 --> 06:23.451
Oh, yeah. Big fans.

06:23.452 --> 06:25.987
Loyal fans. Faithful fans.

06:25.988 --> 06:27.655
Committed fans.

06:27.656 --> 06:29.657
I'm a Laker hater.

06:29.658 --> 06:30.758
Oh.

06:31.293 --> 06:32.327
Well, hey, look, enjoy the game, guys.

06:32.328 --> 06:35.196
All right. Cool.

06:35.197 --> 06:36.865
- Hey.
- Huh?

06:36.866 --> 06:38.132
We cool, right?

06:38.133 --> 06:39.500
- Oh, oh, yeah.
- You betcha.

06:39.501 --> 06:41.169
- Come on, yeah, we good.
- Definitely.

06:41.170 --> 06:44.505
I ain't seen nothing. Look.

06:47.309 --> 06:49.244
How brazen. Right in front of us

06:49.245 --> 06:50.612
like we're not gonna tell Yvette.

06:50.613 --> 06:53.648
That's because we're
not gonna tell Yvette.

06:53.649 --> 06:55.917
Right, we should tell her anonymously,

06:55.918 --> 06:58.219
that way she won't
hold it against us later

06:58.220 --> 07:00.255
when we try to make love to her.

07:00.256 --> 07:01.789
Stevie.

07:01.790 --> 07:05.426
Listen, bro, I feel
for anybody getting played

07:05.427 --> 07:08.196
but we gotta uphold the man code.

07:08.197 --> 07:09.530
What does this have to do

07:09.531 --> 07:12.400
with not looking
at penises at urinals?

07:12.401 --> 07:14.736
I wasn't talking about that man code.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.905
I'm talking about
the man code that says that

07:16.906 --> 07:18.740
when you see another man doing dirt,

07:18.741 --> 07:20.541
you should shut up
and mind your business.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.377
Oh, I've never heard of this code.

07:22.378 --> 07:23.945
I was raised by women.

07:23.946 --> 07:25.246
Nana always said,

07:25.247 --> 07:27.215
"If you see something, say something.

07:27.216 --> 07:30.418
And always wipe from front to back."

07:30.419 --> 07:35.490
Well, actual men have a code
and we must uphold it.

07:35.491 --> 07:37.892
Okay, what if Marley was married?

07:37.893 --> 07:39.761
And we saw her husband
making out with some woman

07:39.762 --> 07:41.496
at the concession stand.

07:41.497 --> 07:42.997
No, no, see, that's when I black out

07:42.998 --> 07:44.866
and wake up
with a dead body in my trunk.

07:44.867 --> 07:47.168
I'm wearing space pampers,
I'm driving down the I-5

07:47.169 --> 07:50.038
doing 55 so the cops don't
pull me over and ask me,

07:50.039 --> 07:53.241
"Hey, what you doing with that
shovel in the front seat?"

07:53.242 --> 07:55.810
See, that's different.
Marley's my daughter.

07:55.811 --> 07:57.445
See, that's my family.

07:57.446 --> 08:00.181
Yvette is Ashley's friend, okay?

08:00.182 --> 08:03.685
So, this is between her and Demetrius.

08:03.686 --> 08:05.186
Well, it defies all logic

08:05.187 --> 08:07.288
and for the record,
I am diametrically opposed

08:07.289 --> 08:08.756
to this "code."

08:08.757 --> 08:10.458
Now I know why Nana
never bothered with men

08:10.459 --> 08:13.461
and spent her whole life with
her best friend Aunt Ruthie.

08:18.734 --> 08:21.602
Why you walking like
a "Walking Dead" zombie?

08:24.306 --> 08:25.873
I just want to hit you
in the head and go,

08:25.874 --> 08:29.143
"Run, Carl!" Bop!

08:29.144 --> 08:32.813
I had a Groupon for half off
at the batting cages.

08:32.815 --> 08:34.849
I took a stray pitch to the hip.

08:34.850 --> 08:36.551
Ashley, it's very clear

08:36.552 --> 08:38.019
what you're doing with these Groupons.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.988
You're just filling the time
because Yvette is back

08:39.989 --> 08:41.756
with that burly ne'er-do-well.

08:41.756 --> 08:43.224
That's not true.

08:43.225 --> 08:45.259
I just have a lot
of extra time on my hands

08:45.260 --> 08:47.428
so I'm dedicating it to myself.

08:47.429 --> 08:49.230
I'm very happy for Yvette.

08:49.231 --> 08:51.065
Lies.

08:51.066 --> 08:53.801
You have to come clean to her.
She's ruining your life.

08:53.802 --> 08:56.437
Tell her, it's either me or him.

08:56.438 --> 08:58.006
I mean, you or him.

08:58.007 --> 08:59.607
We know it's not me.

08:59.608 --> 09:02.410
But it could be.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.678
Stevie.

09:03.679 --> 09:05.913
We have to stay out of this.

09:05.914 --> 09:08.983
You heartless bastard.

09:08.984 --> 09:10.651
If you wanna ignore my feelings, fine,

09:10.652 --> 09:12.253
but what about Ashley's?

09:12.254 --> 09:14.322
The poor girl's in denial
over Yvette's relationship.

09:14.323 --> 09:17.091
Come on, Ashley's gonna be fine.

09:17.092 --> 09:19.927
So, will the instructors
provide the falcons

09:19.928 --> 09:23.097
or do I need to bring my own?

09:23.098 --> 09:24.899
Her mamma's half white.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.735
They into crazy stuff like that.

09:27.736 --> 09:30.271
Demetrius and Yvette,
they're not gonna last.

09:30.272 --> 09:33.241
Trust me, I give it a week.

09:33.242 --> 09:35.877
He liked it, so he put a ring on it.

09:38.914 --> 09:40.948
Okay, so maybe two weeks.

09:40.949 --> 09:44.152
And he's opening up
a restaurant in New York.

09:44.153 --> 09:47.288
We're moving next Friday!

09:47.289 --> 09:50.058
Ah!

09:50.059 --> 09:53.161
Three weeks, tops.

09:53.162 --> 09:56.063
If she's pregnant, four weeks.

10:00.763 --> 10:01.786
Both: Oh!

10:01.787 --> 10:03.521
Oh my gosh, this is amazing.

10:03.522 --> 10:04.822
Let me see this ring.

10:04.823 --> 10:06.257
Oh, girl, I didn't get a ring.

10:06.258 --> 10:07.425
I got a rock.

10:07.426 --> 10:11.027
- Bam!
- Both: Ah!

10:11.028 --> 10:13.363
Okay, so Fraggle got a rock.

10:13.364 --> 10:15.198
Cool.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.500
Okay, has this gone
far enough for you, sir?

10:17.501 --> 10:18.902
We have to do something.

10:18.903 --> 10:22.038
Okay, I... listen.
I'm gonna handle this, okay?

10:22.039 --> 10:23.573
Relax.

10:23.574 --> 10:24.941
We haven't set a date

10:24.942 --> 10:26.776
but we're thinking about
a spring wedding.

10:26.777 --> 10:29.112
- Aw.
- Yeah, but you know, girl,

10:29.113 --> 10:31.348
do you really want
to give up the single life?

10:31.349 --> 10:33.283
Girl, you've been dating so many dudes

10:33.284 --> 10:34.784
that you was like one dude away

10:34.785 --> 10:37.621
from having your name in a rap lyric.

10:37.622 --> 10:39.256
♪ Hittin' Yvette in the 'vette ♪

10:39.257 --> 10:40.757
♪ Hittin' Yvette in the 'vette ♪

10:40.758 --> 10:41.791
Brrrat!

10:41.792 --> 10:43.326
Well, I'm giving up everythang

10:43.327 --> 10:45.061
for that wedding rang.

10:46.564 --> 10:49.199
Yeah, and that's cute and all,

10:49.200 --> 10:50.667
but, you know, think about it.

10:50.668 --> 10:54.537
New York, summer,
it's all hot and humid.

10:54.538 --> 10:56.640
You know, they wreak havoc
on your hair.

10:56.641 --> 10:58.975
You know, it makes it
all frizzy and poofy.

10:58.976 --> 11:00.310
And then in the winter,

11:00.311 --> 11:01.778
it'll make it all dry and brittle.

11:01.779 --> 11:04.447
You're gonna have to invest
in an all-weather weave.

11:04.448 --> 11:09.386
Well, my husband will
take care of all of my needs.

11:09.387 --> 11:11.855
Yeah, but you know,
marriage... you know...

11:11.856 --> 11:14.124
think about it, do you
really wanna get married?

11:14.125 --> 11:15.992
You know, marriage is tough.

11:15.993 --> 11:17.661
You gotta wake up to the same face

11:17.662 --> 11:19.429
day after day after day

11:19.430 --> 11:23.967
and let's be real, you know,
that face ain't gonna age well.

11:23.968 --> 11:25.402
Damn it, Marlon.

11:25.403 --> 11:27.871
I know we got at it
all the time, but today?

11:27.872 --> 11:30.607
On the best day of my life?

11:30.608 --> 11:31.675
Marlon!

11:31.676 --> 11:33.510
Excuse us.

11:33.511 --> 11:35.612
Come on, Ash.

11:35.613 --> 11:37.614
Why are you being so mean?

11:37.615 --> 11:38.982
I wasn't being mean.

11:38.983 --> 11:40.317
I was gonna say she looked like Kermit

11:40.318 --> 11:42.552
when he sips the tea,
but I didn't wanna...

11:45.957 --> 11:47.857
- Yvette.
- Hmm?

11:47.858 --> 11:49.993
Marlon and I have decided to give you

11:49.994 --> 11:52.662
a going away engagement party
this Saturday night

11:52.663 --> 11:55.465
and Marlon wants to spare no expense.

11:55.466 --> 11:58.601
Oh, she lying... Oof!

11:58.602 --> 12:00.470
Thanks, Ash.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.674
Marlon, we have to do something.

12:04.675 --> 12:07.577
The man code
requires us to do nothing,

12:07.578 --> 12:08.979
say nothing, okay?

12:08.980 --> 12:11.147
Look, it's just like
the dress code, right?

12:11.148 --> 12:12.615
Look...

12:12.616 --> 12:15.652
If you want to dress
like the president

12:15.653 --> 12:17.454
of a historically black university,

12:17.455 --> 12:19.589
hey, man, go for it.

12:19.590 --> 12:23.059
Who am I to tell you, you got
Jehovah Witness pants on?

12:24.628 --> 12:27.030
Excuse me, everybody.

12:27.031 --> 12:28.164
Aw.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.367
Thank you, guys, for coming.

12:30.368 --> 12:33.136
Um, I'm moving to New York
with my love

12:33.137 --> 12:35.972
but I'm leaving
a big piece of my heart here.

12:35.973 --> 12:39.442
And I want to thank God
and all the little people that,

12:39.443 --> 12:41.144
you know, supported me
through the years.

12:41.145 --> 12:42.445
Oh my God, girl,

12:42.446 --> 12:45.482
are you moving
or winning an NAACP award?

12:45.483 --> 12:48.218
Ashley, you're my sister.

12:48.219 --> 12:51.187
Your babies are my little angels.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.323
And Stevie...

12:53.324 --> 12:56.593
you will forever be
like a brother to me.

12:56.594 --> 12:58.728
Damn, you all right. It's all right.

13:00.598 --> 13:04.434
And, I can't even believe
I'm saying this, but um...

13:04.435 --> 13:06.536
I'm even gonna miss
that big-headed Marlon.

13:08.039 --> 13:10.507
Y'all are my family.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.078
You hear that, Marlon?

13:15.079 --> 13:16.946
She thinks we're family.

13:16.947 --> 13:19.516
How ridiculous is that?

13:24.755 --> 13:26.356
Hey, D.

13:26.357 --> 13:28.958
- Congratulations, bro.
- Ah, hey, hey, thank you.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.460
- Looking sharp.
- Thank you, thank you.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.430
Look at you, taking people
off the market and whatnot.

13:33.431 --> 13:35.832
Yeah, well, Yvette is well worth it.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.600
Yeah, man, yeah, yeah...

13:37.601 --> 13:39.803
You know, things change
once you get a ring on it.

13:39.804 --> 13:42.205
You know what I mean?
Trust me, I know.

13:42.206 --> 13:43.907
It means no more little Laker games

13:43.908 --> 13:46.209
with little your friend,
you know what I'm saying?

13:46.210 --> 13:48.511
Yeah, no more Lakers games,
but I got some friends

13:48.512 --> 13:50.380
who like the Knicks
if you know what I mean.

13:50.381 --> 13:52.348
There ain't nobody
that like no damn Knicks.

13:52.349 --> 13:53.950
What you talking about?

13:53.951 --> 13:55.485
- Guess what.
- What?

13:55.486 --> 13:59.589
I'm learning to play
"Ribbon in the Sky" on the harp

13:59.590 --> 14:02.258
for your wedding day.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.061
Groupon!

14:05.062 --> 14:07.564
Ashley, I know what you're doing.

14:07.565 --> 14:09.299
What? I'm just...

14:09.300 --> 14:11.768
Excited for my girl.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.804
I saw you do this
after you divorced Marlon.

14:14.805 --> 14:18.775
You took an improv class,
then puppet making,

14:18.776 --> 14:21.111
and then you even had my ass
up in a hot air balloon.

14:21.112 --> 14:24.881
Talking about,
"We land where we land."

14:24.882 --> 14:28.051
You're distracting yourself
from feeling something.

14:29.220 --> 14:33.156
Come on.
What do you think I'm feeling?

14:34.225 --> 14:37.093
I'm gonna miss you too.

14:38.496 --> 14:41.731
- I love you.
- Aw.

14:41.732 --> 14:44.734
That girl's turning her
whole life upside down for you

14:44.735 --> 14:46.736
and you just playing her like that?

14:47.938 --> 14:49.739
And that involves you, how?

14:49.740 --> 14:51.341
I'm just saying, that's Ashley's girl,

14:51.342 --> 14:53.309
that's how it involves me.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.944
Well, how about I just bust your ass

14:54.945 --> 14:56.880
for being up in my business?

14:56.881 --> 14:58.615
You gonna... you gonna...

15:00.751 --> 15:03.052
Oh...

15:03.053 --> 15:04.587
Oh...

15:04.588 --> 15:06.723
That's what I wanted you to say.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.960
You gonna flare your nostrils at me?

15:10.961 --> 15:12.829
You gonna give me dragon nose?

15:12.830 --> 15:16.399
I breathe you in, boy.
I breathe you in, boy.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.934
Oh, you think you tough because

15:17.935 --> 15:19.569
you got some tattoos on your body?

15:19.570 --> 15:24.707
Your tattoos say, "Smile,"
"Peace," and "Blessings."

15:24.708 --> 15:26.609
"Have a nice day."

15:26.610 --> 15:28.845
How you gonna have tattoos
when you all dark-skinned?

15:28.846 --> 15:30.280
You gotta read
your tattoos like brail.

15:30.281 --> 15:31.814
What they say? Oh, I'm sorry about

15:31.815 --> 15:35.485
your grandma, may she rest in peace.

15:35.486 --> 15:37.921
I know you got... I know
you got pit bull ears

15:37.922 --> 15:41.758
but I ain't scared of you, dog.

15:41.759 --> 15:43.693
I'm a Doberman Pinscher.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.828
I'm a Great Dane.

15:45.829 --> 15:48.164
I'm a Rhodesian Ridgeback.

15:48.165 --> 15:50.567
And you don't want none of this.

15:50.568 --> 15:52.435
You don't want... I smell... Oh.

15:52.436 --> 15:53.803
I smell the fear.

15:53.804 --> 15:55.638
I smell the fear in you.

15:55.639 --> 15:57.207
That's right, 'cause I'm an animal.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.408
I smell the fear.

15:58.409 --> 15:59.609
Huh?

15:59.610 --> 16:00.877
You don't want none of this reach.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.412
Boy, look at that reach.
Look at the reach.

16:02.413 --> 16:04.314
I connect right there. Bow!

16:04.315 --> 16:06.683
You out already, dog.

16:06.684 --> 16:08.151
You think you...

16:08.152 --> 16:09.852
You're gonna clinch your jaw at me?

16:09.853 --> 16:11.921
I'll clinch mine too.
Huh, you think you so tough?

16:11.922 --> 16:14.724
Oh, you think you tough 'cause
you've probably been to jail.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.426
I've been to jail too.

16:16.427 --> 16:18.761
36 hours for parking tickets, boy.

16:18.762 --> 16:19.996
You don't know about that.

16:19.997 --> 16:21.898
You don't know about the hard time.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.866
You don't know about the hard time.

16:23.867 --> 16:26.035
Let me call my boys real fast for you.

16:26.036 --> 16:27.704
Alert! Cuckoo!

16:27.705 --> 16:31.407
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

16:32.943 --> 16:34.777
The whole gang heard it.

16:34.778 --> 16:38.214
Give me four minutes,
they gonna be right outside.

16:38.215 --> 16:40.416
Clapping on you, boy.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.518
Oh, 'cause you got
a little shoulders on you.

16:42.519 --> 16:44.520
'Cause your shoulders got shoulders

16:44.521 --> 16:47.423
and your triceps is like,
all triceptical and stuff.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.525
You wanna get buff?
I'll get buff with you.

16:49.526 --> 16:51.628
You think... and I'll get buff quick.

16:51.629 --> 16:52.929
Ha!

16:52.930 --> 16:54.230
Ha!

16:54.231 --> 16:55.798
Ha!

16:55.799 --> 16:59.035
Think you all tough, looking
like a female body builder.

17:00.204 --> 17:01.804
All right. All right, you got

17:01.805 --> 17:03.973
a little more weight than me.
Let me get my weight up.

17:03.974 --> 17:05.340
Let me get a little sammich.

17:05.342 --> 17:07.944
Get a little protein.
Get some protein in me.

17:07.944 --> 17:11.781
Mmm, boy. Now what?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.782
I got nutrients. I go for days.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.385
I got nutrients in me, boy.

17:15.386 --> 17:18.121
Let me get a drink real fast,
wash this down.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.856
Hold on one second.

17:19.857 --> 17:22.425
Oh, then when I get the drink
in me, if it's dark liquor...

17:22.425 --> 17:26.496
Oh, don't let me get
the dark liquor...

17:26.497 --> 17:29.265
Da-da-la, da-da-la,
da-da-la, da-da-la.

17:29.266 --> 17:32.435
Boy!

17:32.436 --> 17:35.705
I grab you by your thick neck
and toss you right through

17:35.706 --> 17:37.507
that damn buffet table.

17:37.508 --> 17:40.076
Say I won't.

17:41.779 --> 17:44.047
Promise me you'll call me every day.

17:44.048 --> 17:45.615
Of course, girl.

17:45.616 --> 17:49.319
Now, let's just enjoy
this party and no more drama.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.121
- Okay.
- Ah!

17:58.329 --> 18:01.664
I should have never told
that boy my game plan.

18:04.943 --> 18:07.343
Demetrius, what did he say to you?

18:07.344 --> 18:09.512
'Cause I know he be saying stuff.

18:09.513 --> 18:11.146
Marlon.

18:11.147 --> 18:12.381
- Marlon!
- What?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.783
Are you okay? What is going on?

18:14.784 --> 18:16.050
I'm good.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.919
Me and Demetrius was just having

18:17.920 --> 18:23.057
a little heated conversation
about, uh, fantasy basketball.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.293
Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.

18:25.294 --> 18:28.630
Yeah, see, I was telling D
that I don't like the way

18:28.631 --> 18:30.231
he manages his team.

18:30.232 --> 18:32.200
He has this star player

18:32.201 --> 18:33.968
and he won't bench
the rest of his scrubs.

18:33.969 --> 18:36.571
But what Marlon doesn't
understand is they're my scrubs

18:36.572 --> 18:38.673
and I put them in
whatever position I want.

18:38.674 --> 18:40.174
Mm-hmm.

18:40.175 --> 18:41.609
And that's exactly what he was saying

18:41.610 --> 18:45.146
before he playfully tossed me
over the buffet table.

18:45.147 --> 18:50.051
You stupid for that one, boy.

18:50.052 --> 18:52.787
But seriously...

18:52.788 --> 18:56.090
you should be willing
to give up your entire team

18:56.091 --> 18:59.994
for the franchise player
like the one you got.

18:59.995 --> 19:01.763
Man, they both wrong.

19:01.764 --> 19:03.631
All you need is a good ball handler

19:03.632 --> 19:06.834
who can penetrate up the middle.

19:08.804 --> 19:10.905
Aw, come on, Ash.

19:10.906 --> 19:12.206
It's not like I get thrown

19:12.207 --> 19:13.975
through a buffet table every day.

19:13.976 --> 19:15.476
True.

19:15.477 --> 19:19.414
But three times
since I've known you is a lot.

19:22.451 --> 19:24.586
Yvette?

19:24.587 --> 19:27.288
Sweetie, you okay?

19:27.289 --> 19:29.824
I need to talk to Marlon alone.

19:29.825 --> 19:32.593
Okay, I'll let you two talk.

19:38.734 --> 19:40.468
So...

19:40.469 --> 19:42.503
What happened to your ring?

19:42.504 --> 19:45.039
Girl, did you pawn it already?

19:45.040 --> 19:48.443
I threw it out the car window.

19:48.444 --> 19:51.145
I knew something was up when we left.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.615
So, I pushed him...

19:53.616 --> 19:56.684
and he told me he was cheating on me.

19:56.685 --> 20:00.888
But you knew that, didn't you?

20:00.889 --> 20:02.323
Nah.

20:02.324 --> 20:04.058
If Demetrius was double dipping,

20:04.059 --> 20:06.694
this is the first time
I'm hearing about it.

20:06.695 --> 20:08.363
Fine.

20:08.364 --> 20:12.166
You were just fighting over
fantasy basketball because...

20:12.167 --> 20:17.405
you didn't like the way he was
treating his franchise player.

20:17.406 --> 20:20.508
She's the best player he'll ever have.

20:20.509 --> 20:22.176
She?

20:23.379 --> 20:26.514
Oh, it was, um, WNBA fantasy league.

20:26.515 --> 20:28.683
Thanks, Marlon.

20:28.684 --> 20:31.252
- Oh, come on.
- You're my family.

20:31.253 --> 20:33.488
All right, stop it.

20:33.489 --> 20:36.457
You're gonna make me catch
whatever it is you got.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.159
- Marlon.
- What?

20:38.160 --> 20:40.261
You better be hugging her back.

20:40.262 --> 20:42.930
All right, nosey.

20:42.931 --> 20:44.265
All right.

20:44.266 --> 20:46.367
I gotta do something about my face.

20:46.368 --> 20:48.836
Girl, I've been
telling you that for years.

20:48.837 --> 20:51.673
Shut up.

20:51.674 --> 20:53.775
Hey.

20:53.776 --> 20:57.245
Come here, Yvette.

20:57.246 --> 21:00.281
You know you're too good
for that jerk, anyway.

21:00.282 --> 21:02.917
You know he fine.

21:02.918 --> 21:05.420
- Yes, he is.
- Mm-hmm.

21:05.421 --> 21:07.555
But you always got me.

21:07.556 --> 21:09.757
Bitch, that ain't the same thing.

21:11.210 --> 21:16.552
