with James last night.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.152
- He's over there

the guy swings at him

around and apologizing,

so I don't--

04:13.787 --> 04:16.089

about that too.

and I were getting close, yeah.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.997
and I know she doesn't even
like being a bridesmaid, and...

04:24.031 --> 04:26.834
I already knew that I
was not going to ask Ariana

04:26.867 --> 04:28.369
to be a bridesmaid.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.605
I mean, her defending Lala's
indefensible behavior recently

04:31.639 --> 04:35.142
didn't improve the likelihood
that I would ask her anyway.

about f---ing groups,

04:37.611 --> 04:38.846

asshole, but this is how I feel.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.423
Would've been more awkward,

04:49.457 --> 04:51.359

felt like she had to say yes.

Well, then I am not going

04:53.126 --> 04:54.695

08:43.023 --> 08:44.858
people see me winning
right now,

08:44.892 --> 08:47.294
and they don't like it, they--
- But you're not Calvis Harris

08:47.327 --> 08:49.496
right now.
- But at the same time,

08:49.597 --> 08:53.133
I'm giving something more than
what they're giving right now.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.202
Let's face it.
You know, I'm in the position

08:55.235 --> 08:56.704
where everybody wishes
they were in.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.871
Something's got to give.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.472
You got to be
a little bit pissed about,

08:59.506 --> 09:02.610
especially when the newcomer
comes in, becomes the main DJ,

09:02.610 --> 09:04.211
and has a top-100
track on iTunes.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.748
I mean, if I was them,
I would come after me.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.683
So...come at me.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.384
- Do you think you're innocent
in all this?

09:11.418 --> 09:12.920
Just tell me the truth.
- Yes.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.922
- My experience with you...
- Yeah.

09:14.955 --> 09:19.126
- It supersedes any explanation
that you're gonna give me,

09:19.159 --> 09:22.195
because I just...
I don't trust you.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.366
I do have a lot of sympathy
for James,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.235
and I think I've been
more than lenient.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.003
I'm very fair,
but at some point,

09:30.037 --> 09:32.039
I am gonna have to stick
my Louboutin

09:32.072 --> 09:34.007
up his little skinny ass.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.877
It makes it very difficult
for me to keep you employed.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.646
You know that, right?
- Yes.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.280
- I've given you as many
chances,

09:40.313 --> 09:41.649
more than anybody else.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.016
- Oh, my God.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.019
[dramatic music]

09:46.053 --> 09:48.021
*

09:48.055 --> 09:49.289
- Luckily for you,

09:49.322 --> 09:51.291
it looked like the other guy
was the perpetrator,

09:51.324 --> 09:53.160
and I'm happy to hear that.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.762
- Thank God.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.263
- The favors
have run out, James.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.166
If I catch you drinking,
doing whatever you're doing,

09:59.199 --> 10:01.234
if you do any of that,

10:01.268 --> 10:02.970
[clicks tongue] we're done.
- All right.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.839
- I spoke to a plethora
of people at Pump,

10:05.873 --> 10:08.341
and if one person had said
James was at fault,

10:08.375 --> 10:09.743
then he would've been
out of there.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.012
But I just had to let it go,

10:12.045 --> 10:15.348
because this time it wasn't
James Kennedy's fault.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.117
Now, will you go and do

10:17.150 --> 10:19.086
what you're supposed to be doing
and spin some disks?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.754
- Yes.
- Now, get your ass in there.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.024
Coming up...
- This is special,

10:24.057 --> 10:26.694
and I want
you guys to remember this.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.195
- Dude!
- What--

10:33.266 --> 10:34.234
- [singing indistinctly]
* With them $100 bills

10:36.003 --> 10:37.304
* Rollin' in the Rolls

10:37.337 --> 10:39.372
* Came to all that,
everything *

10:39.406 --> 10:40.708
* Sippin' on some Cris

10:40.741 --> 10:42.843
* While that bass
pumpin' louder *

10:42.876 --> 10:45.212
[singing indistinctly]

10:45.245 --> 10:46.714
* Oh, oh

10:46.747 --> 10:48.448
- How did that conversation go?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.550
I saw it.
- It went just fine.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.519
I know you don't like him,
but--

10:52.552 --> 10:53.754
- It's not that
I don't like him.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.655
I just don't respect him.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.457
- Well, he's young and stupid.
- Well, you keep

10:57.490 --> 10:58.859
making excuses for him,

10:58.892 --> 11:01.294
and I mean,
he's a 24-year-old adult.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.630
- Let's cast our mind
back seven years ago.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.765
- But I was just trying
to be nice.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.233
I said, "Hi. You look pretty."
- I know.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.567
- And then she's like,
"What's wrong with your tooth?"

11:07.600 --> 11:09.737
- You did sleep
with her husband.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.304
- Well...

11:11.338 --> 11:13.140
Oh, absolutely.

11:13.173 --> 11:17.010
- I have given him more chances
than he probably deserves.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.413
But I also see what's gone on
in his life the last six months.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.749
- Yeah.
You just can't keep using

11:21.782 --> 11:24.184
one traumatic experience
as an excuse

11:24.217 --> 11:26.787
for all other behavior.
- You're right.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.088
- [British accent]
How many more chances

11:28.121 --> 11:30.057
are we going
to give him, darling?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.324
But right now,
I need to get back to my tables.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.260
- That's the best news
I've ever heard.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.427
Go on. Off you go.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.201
[energetic music]

11:41.234 --> 11:43.403
*

11:43.436 --> 11:44.938
- Hi.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.107
- Are those my drinks?
- Yes, they are.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.341
I'm trying to find a muddler.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.979
Did you see Lisa
and James talking?

11:52.012 --> 11:54.247
- That kid can just not
stay out of trouble.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.583
- He needs work.
We know that.

11:56.616 --> 12:01.554
The DJ is here,
so I guess everything's cool.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.557
- I mean, isn't it always?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.526
- Hey, James,
is everything cool?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.495
- With what?
- With Lisa, with--

12:08.528 --> 12:10.330
- Yeah. We are good.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.799
- All right. Good.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.002
- The fact that I didn't
choose Ariana as a bridesmaid

12:15.035 --> 12:17.805
I feel good about,
especially considering with her

12:17.805 --> 12:19.807
just, like, high-fiving James
in front of me,

12:19.807 --> 12:21.408
who is, like,
the worst version of a person

12:21.441 --> 12:22.876
that humanity has to offer.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.845
- How is everything else?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.147
- We put the deposit down
on the venue,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.716
and, like, luckily,
we want to keep it small.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.218
- And you save money
that way too.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.286
- That's what I'm saying.
He didn't want any groomsmen.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.654
Now, he wants, like, ten.
I'm like--

12:34.687 --> 12:36.824
- Does that mean you are
gonna have to have ten?

12:36.824 --> 12:37.958
- No.
It's probably a conversation

12:37.991 --> 12:41.929
that needs to be had,
but, like...

12:41.962 --> 12:45.432
I know you're not
crazy about bridesmaid stuff.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.634
And I know it's like, yeah,
there was at one point that,

12:47.667 --> 12:49.602
like, you know, obviously...

12:52.205 --> 12:54.107
'Cause like, last year,
we've kind of had, like,

12:54.141 --> 12:55.708
a little bit of
a separation and stuff.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.011
But I like that
it's still...

12:58.045 --> 13:00.313
We're still--it's still good.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.515
- So if you're trying
to tell me

13:02.549 --> 13:04.051
that I'm not a bridesmaid,

13:04.084 --> 13:06.653
it would be a lot easier
if you just said it.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.856
- I didn't want
to put pressure on you.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.657
I didn't want to put pressure
on myself of having,

13:10.690 --> 13:12.192
like,
the dynamic with everyone

13:12.225 --> 13:13.994
and, like, put everyone
out of their comfort zone.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.228
- You know I'm involved
in whatever way

13:15.262 --> 13:16.864
you want me
to be involved in.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.166
It doesn't require me to be
wearing a bridesmaid's dress.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.368
- Right. Yeah.
I'm gonna take this to my table.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.570
Thank you.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.772
- * Life, live it up,
gettin' rowdy *

13:25.873 --> 13:27.007
* This life's all right

13:27.040 --> 13:28.608
* Yeah, we party,
and we rowdy *

13:28.641 --> 13:30.243
* This life's all right

13:30.277 --> 13:31.912
* Live it up,
gettin' rowdy *

13:31.945 --> 13:33.380
* This life's all right

13:33.413 --> 13:34.514
* So open up, baby

13:34.547 --> 13:35.916
* Here I come

13:35.949 --> 13:38.886
* We gonna party all night,
all night *

13:38.886 --> 13:41.021
* Because this life,
this life *

13:41.054 --> 13:42.422
[knock at door]

13:43.891 --> 13:45.725
- What the f--- is this?
- You told us to dress up, dude,

13:45.758 --> 13:47.895
and we can't not
not wear flip-flops...

13:47.928 --> 13:49.362
- I know.
- Because of how many times

13:49.396 --> 13:51.064
we'd get all the way
o the front door of some club

13:51.098 --> 13:52.900
and you'd get turned away

13:52.900 --> 13:54.134
because you were
wearing flip-flops.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.202
- You guys, welcome.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.803
I'm taking care
of you guys tonight.

13:56.904 --> 14:00.007
Jax and Tom are two of the
first people I met here in L.A.,

14:00.040 --> 14:01.674
and I want to do
something special for them.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.676
You know, I want to cook them
a really nice dinner

14:03.710 --> 14:06.313
just as a reminder of how much
I appreciate their friendship,

14:06.346 --> 14:08.715
and I really do value
everything they've done for me.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.183
Dude, those shrimp--

14:10.217 --> 14:11.919
Yo, the freshest shrimp
you'll ever have.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.086
Dude, how good is that?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.922
- Dude, they're delicious.
- Can we focus

14:14.922 --> 14:16.323
on the wedding right now?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.358
Speaking of the wedding, I had
probably one of the top-ten

14:18.391 --> 14:20.360
most awkward moments
of my life.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.595
I had the prenup
conversation.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.999
Before we get married, I think
we should probably get a prenup,

14:26.033 --> 14:27.667
just as a precautionary
measure.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.136
Just--no, no.
Listen!

14:29.169 --> 14:30.637
It's not
an expression of doubt.

14:30.670 --> 14:31.939
- I mean, I hadn't,
like, thought about it,

14:31.939 --> 14:33.340
but, like,
I'm not against prenups.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.409
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.111
I can get it for somebody
who makes $1 million

14:38.145 --> 14:39.947
that's a celebrity that marries
somebody who's not--

14:39.947 --> 14:40.948
- No. I know people
whose lives

14:40.948 --> 14:42.849
have been torn apart
by divorces.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.985
- It's a classic example of,

14:45.018 --> 14:47.420
like, lawyers
basically making the money.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.223
I just feel like prenups
are a good idea.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.026
My mom and dad got divorced
when I was in fourth grade.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.996
My dad actually got
divorced another time.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.830
His second one obviously
went a lot smoother,

14:57.864 --> 14:59.967
because he knew
how to handle it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.201
- But essentially,
I'm bringing you guys over here

15:01.234 --> 15:02.970
just as a reminder
of how much I appreciate

15:02.970 --> 15:05.172
everything you guys did for me
when I first came here.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.040
Oh, my God, I'm actually
getting emotional.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.510
I think you know
what I'm gonna say next.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.712
- What?
- I would love it

15:12.745 --> 15:14.414
if you guys
would be my groomsmen.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.715
- Yeah. Of course.
- I'm in!

15:15.748 --> 15:17.084
- Yeah.
- Dude, come on.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.685
- I mean, come and be
my groomsmen.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.786
Come on. Bring it in.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.254
- Yes. Bring it in
for the good stuff.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.555
- I don't want to get teary.
I don't want to get--

15:22.589 --> 15:24.557
I can't help
but feel nostalgic

15:24.591 --> 15:26.826
about where we
started off from

15:26.859 --> 15:28.895
with the Craigslist ad,
and you know, be like

15:28.996 --> 15:30.263
almost a big brother
to Schwartz

15:30.297 --> 15:33.000
and see him sort of
come into his own.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.403
And I just know
that on the day of his wedding,

15:36.436 --> 15:40.807
I'm gonna be so proud
to be standing next to him.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.110
- You guys,
it's coming in, baby.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.811
- My own girlfriend doesn't
make me dinners like this.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.446
- Look at that. That's mashed
potatoes, jalapeno creamed corn.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.015
There's some broccoli.
No, it's the least

15:48.048 --> 15:49.682
I can do, man, I mean--

15:49.716 --> 15:51.184
- For hazing you for years?
- Yeah, dude.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.021
You guys have done
a f---ing lot for me, man.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.388
- [laughing]
- It started with Jax.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.524
As if it wasn't sad enough to be
sleeping on an air mattress,

15:57.557 --> 15:59.026
Jax would come home wasted.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.661
He would f---ing pull the plug
on my air mattress,

16:01.694 --> 16:03.830
and I would wake up
on the hard floor.

16:03.863 --> 16:04.831
- And then
I would be in my room,

16:04.864 --> 16:06.033
and I'd hear, like...

16:06.033 --> 16:08.135
[Jax and Tom
making pump sound]

16:08.168 --> 16:09.302
- Jax!

16:09.336 --> 16:10.437
- Jax and Tom...

16:10.470 --> 16:12.039
they hazed
the sh-- out of me.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.908
Whether it was out of love
or spite, they hazed me.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.377
- Dude, you've got to--

16:18.845 --> 16:20.113
- Hey, man--
- [laughs]

16:20.147 --> 16:22.815
- Get outta here. Ew--
- What the f---?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.917
- Oh, my God.
- No. I'm not--

16:24.951 --> 16:28.055
- I just feel like
I never got even.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.922
So I've been looking
for a chance,

16:29.956 --> 16:32.892
an opportunity to start to...

16:32.925 --> 16:34.961
make things even,
you know?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.564
Smell that f---ing meat.
You can smell the quality.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.798
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Lick it.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.233
- Yeah.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.434
- I went all out for this meal.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.770
I even made
my own special spice.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.305
I know you like it medium-rare.
It's medium-well.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.506
- It's great, man. Chill.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.575
- That I marinated these in

16:48.608 --> 16:51.111
before
I served them to the guys.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.346
You guys clean your plates,
I'm gonna cry.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.781
- Why?
- F---, man.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.549
It's just,
I mean, I appreciate it.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.151
- Delicious.
- F---. There's no denying

16:58.185 --> 16:59.719
you guys tortured me,
and I feel like

16:59.752 --> 17:01.188
I never
really repaid you guys.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.657
Now is a good time to
sort of start the repayment.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.393
- Uh-oh.
- Don't panic.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.995
Don't panic.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.665
This is special, and I want
you guys to remember this.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.766
I want you to open them up.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.868
- Oh, no.
- Our repayments--

17:15.902 --> 17:17.237
[dramatic music]

17:17.270 --> 17:19.106
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.840
Dude!
- What--

17:20.873 --> 17:23.876
What the hell is that, dude?
- The f---?

17:23.910 --> 17:25.178
What is that, dude?

17:25.212 --> 17:26.813
- What is that thing
in the butt cheek in the middle?

17:26.846 --> 17:29.116
- It's your steak,
mother----er.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.283
- What?

17:30.317 --> 17:33.320
[light music]

17:33.353 --> 17:35.388
Oh, my God!

17:35.422 --> 17:36.989
*

17:37.023 --> 17:38.525
- Dude, what the f---?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.826
- And I should just add this.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.129
Before I did this,
I did run three miles,

17:42.129 --> 17:43.630
and I didn't shower afterwards.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.633
[light music]

17:46.666 --> 17:48.535
*

17:48.568 --> 17:52.672
- I honestly feel a f---ing pube
in my f---ing throat.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.441
I mean, this is, like,
some Shakespearian, like,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.176
cutting up the guy's sons

17:56.209 --> 18:00.513
and cooking it in a meat pie
and feeding it to him.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.715
God, I'm pissed
I didn't think of that first.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.951
- I feel good!

18:04.984 --> 18:06.286
- Dude, are you
f---ing kidding me?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.155
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is genius.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.656
I gotta admit
the food was good.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.159
Ass-steaks or no ass-steaks,
I liked it.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.994
- You ate steaks that were
between my ass cheeks.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.463
- He was worse than I was.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.731
- You put your penis on
his head in the morning.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.932
You put it on there
and went like this.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.434
Tap-tap, tap-tap,
tap-tap-tap.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.036
- Dude, I had to spread
my cheeks so far apart--

18:24.070 --> 18:25.838
- F---ing gross!

18:25.872 --> 18:27.907
I don't want to hear
any more about it!

18:27.940 --> 18:29.676
- Coming up...
- If you were to say to me

18:29.709 --> 18:32.044
right now "Katie, I apologize
for calling you a whore,"

18:32.078 --> 18:33.012
I'd be like, "Girl, we're good."

18:38.618 --> 18:39.186
- * We make the rules

18:40.187 --> 18:41.788
* We call the shots

18:41.821 --> 18:43.190
* We burn the streets

18:43.190 --> 18:44.791
* We all we got

18:44.824 --> 18:47.427
* Me and my,
me and my crew *

18:47.460 --> 18:49.095
* Me and my crew...

18:49.196 --> 18:50.463
- Hi, ladies.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.565
- This is such a cute store.
- Thank you.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.467
How are you?
- Good.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.936
I'm getting married August 17th.
- Okay.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.539
So we're still within,
like, that six to eight weeks

18:59.572 --> 19:01.441
of getting an invitation out.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.075
Here. Let's look
at our font book.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.811
Is this something like--
- This is cool.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.213
I like that.
- You like that?

19:06.213 --> 19:07.447
- Yeah. I do like that.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.915
- You ever do anything
that's kind of

19:08.948 --> 19:10.617
like more like
of, like, a keepsake,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.552
like a tea towel with,
like,

19:12.585 --> 19:14.521
a really cool, like,
graphic with the name?

19:14.554 --> 19:15.588
- Oh, yeah.
- It's actually really cute.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.657
- Really, yeah.
This ties right on top

19:17.690 --> 19:18.825
of the tea towel.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.527
See the texture of,
like, the wood grain?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.395
- I love that.
- Sending a tea towel

19:22.429 --> 19:24.897
with our wedding invitation
was my idea,

19:24.931 --> 19:27.267
and when I ran it by Schwartz,
he really liked it.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.836
- We definitely have an idea
of what you want.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.838
So let me just kind of go
and work some numbers.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.806
- I think his only concern
is that it

19:33.840 --> 19:36.843
doesn't cost more than a penny,
which isn't gonna happen.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.746
In other, like, planning news,

19:39.779 --> 19:42.715
he wanted to have an official
housewarming party, since...

19:42.749 --> 19:44.083
- Fun!
- We've never really had

19:44.116 --> 19:46.018
like a home that we could
have more than six people

19:46.052 --> 19:47.387
in at a time, and--

19:47.420 --> 19:49.256
- Shoot. I might have
to give you presents late.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.458
- Just bring alcohol.
- Yeah.

19:51.491 --> 19:55.262
- And bring Carter,
and bring yourself.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.964
- Bring myself.
- You're single,

19:57.997 --> 20:00.032
and you live alone,
but okay.

20:00.066 --> 20:03.069
- It's really fun doing all of
these bridesmaid things,

20:03.102 --> 20:05.171
but it's really hard
when Patrick and I

20:05.204 --> 20:08.608
are heading
to our final breakup.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.910
I don't even feel comfortable
talking about it anymore,

20:10.943 --> 20:12.279
because it happens all the time.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.846
Every time we break up,
it's a joke.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.248
Every time we get back together,
it's a joke.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.716
I feel like a joke.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.718
- With everything
all put together,

20:18.751 --> 20:21.588
we're talking our
custom-printed tea towel.

20:21.621 --> 20:26.293
You'll have a 5x7 detail printed
on the bellum, your RSVP card,

20:26.326 --> 20:27.527
and then we're gonna
put it in a box.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.896
It's coming to about
18.50 per invite.

20:29.929 --> 20:33.065
You're looking at about 2,775
if we're doing 150.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.667
- Is that, like, normal--
what people spend?

20:34.701 --> 20:35.802
- It is, like I mean,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.504
you're doing something
a bit more custom.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.705
- As Schwartz would say,

20:38.738 --> 20:40.840
"That's just how
the cookie crumbles," so--

20:40.873 --> 20:43.476
- Okay.
Cool! How exciting.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.545
I'm gonna need to rob a bank.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.221

- How's it going?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.331

It's been pretty steady.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.703
- Are you okay, darling?

21:10.737 --> 21:14.341

- Yeah? How's everything going?

21:14.341 --> 21:16.609
- Pretty good. Pretty good.
- No drinking?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.478
Nothing?
- It's busy.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.380
- Let me smell you.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.848
Hey, hey--

21:21.881 --> 21:23.215
- I thought
you meant my cologne.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.452
- No, no, no, I'm not worried
about your cologne.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.987
I'm worried about
your alcohol intake.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.623
I hope this is the behavior
of the real James Kennedy

21:30.657 --> 21:32.659
and not the James Kennedy
that's trying to fool me.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.794
Okay. As long as you're
keeping out of trouble

21:34.827 --> 21:36.963
and keeping your nose clean,
that's all I want to hear.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.065
- Okay. Thank you.
See you later.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.812
- Does Scheana work
tonight?

21:52.845 --> 21:54.381
- Yeah. I think so.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.283
- I'm really feeling badly
about the sh-- I've said.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.620
I just need five minutes,
five minutes.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.855
- Just keep everything, like,
super matter-of-fact.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.625
Scheana and I
used to be friends.

22:05.658 --> 22:09.429
- I've been so f---ing genuine
to everybody,

22:09.462 --> 22:10.930
and I just can't win.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.665
- I know the feeling.
Trust me.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.468
- Scheana, come to Mama,
honey.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.137
- Oh, damn, Gina!

22:18.170 --> 22:21.273
- But now she has her head
so far up Katie's ass,

22:21.307 --> 22:24.877
I am just hoping
that God is with me.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.414
All right.
Well, wish me luck, honey.

- Yeah. Thank you.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.996
- Okay. Let me know
if you need anything.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.264
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.033
- Can I talk to you
for five minutes?

22:47.066 --> 22:48.701
- Not five minutes,
'cause I have tables.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.769
It's busy.
- Five seconds?

22:49.802 --> 22:53.840
Um...I'm just wondering
where you and I

22:53.873 --> 22:56.543
hit a point
where we were no longer okay.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.110
- We were a year ago.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.012
Then I don't like what you've
said about my best friend.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.448
I feel like
she's the first person

23:01.481 --> 23:02.782
you should go to to apologize,

23:02.815 --> 23:04.451
because you--
- I'm not going to her first,

23:04.451 --> 23:05.952
because she hasn't liked me
from the beginning.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.119
This has nothing to do--
- She did like you

23:07.153 --> 23:08.655
in the beginning.
- No, she didn't.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.823
Like, I don't feel good about
what's going on right now.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.460
I'm apologizing
because I feel badly

23:13.460 --> 23:15.995
that I've been
basically a bully.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.597
- It's just so f---ed up,

23:17.630 --> 23:18.965
the things you and James
have said about her.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.067
Like, it's not okay.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.969
- Of course I'm sorry
for the things

23:23.002 --> 23:24.136
I've said about Katie,
but I feel--

23:24.170 --> 23:25.738
- Well, but until you
apologize to her

23:25.772 --> 23:27.339
and she accepts your apology--
- See, I don't like that.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.476
- I'm not cool with people
who trash my friends.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.644
I'm not at a point
where I want to

23:31.678 --> 23:33.713
accept Lala's apology
and forgive her,

23:33.746 --> 23:36.716
because until Katie gets
on that level,

23:36.749 --> 23:38.384
I've learned my lesson.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.853
I'm being loyal.
I am sticking by her.

Whatever Katie wants to do,
I will do as well.

Girl, Lala--I was
checking on a table outside

24:04.010 --> 24:05.878
if they needed more drinks,
and as I'm walking back in,

24:05.912 --> 24:08.548
she, like,
stops me to apologize.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.950
At first--
- I can't. I can't.

24:10.983 --> 24:14.420
- I said--I was like,
"You have talked so much sh--.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.955
It's not okay."
- And unwarranted.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.557
Like, I haven't done anything.
I'm sorry.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.592
The last real interaction we had
was at my engagement party.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.360

what it was--

24:21.393 --> 24:22.862
- Can you wrap it up?

24:22.895 --> 24:24.230
What the f---
are you talking about?

24:24.263 --> 24:26.065
[muttering,
imitating Kristen]

24:26.098 --> 24:28.535

The unfortunate part is

24:28.568 --> 24:30.637
is I have mutual friends

24:30.670 --> 24:32.972
with some of your
mutual friends,

to know, and guess what.

I have not gone publicly.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.410
You want to talk about

24:38.444 --> 24:39.812
Let's talk about you.

from multiple unrelated sources,

24:44.416 --> 24:46.586

24:48.555 --> 24:50.289
And he's been bankrolling her

24:50.322 --> 24:52.725
and got her a nice, new car
and an apartment

24:52.759 --> 24:55.161
and all these, you know,
fancy little presents.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.831
And I prefer to make my money
the old-fashioned way,

24:58.865 --> 25:01.568
by putting in the time
and the effort

25:01.568 --> 25:05.204
as opposed to putting a d---
in my mouth, like Lala.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.874
Anyways, and I know
my table needs a wine list.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.609
- Okay.
- [groans]

25:09.642 --> 25:11.443
- * I'm about to tear this

25:11.477 --> 25:13.079
* Tear this out

25:13.112 --> 25:16.482
* Gotta get a little
messy in here *

25:16.583 --> 25:18.951
* I'm gonna start
some trouble *

25:18.985 --> 25:20.019
- Are you--are you good

25:20.052 --> 25:21.420
to cover me
for just a sec?

25:21.453 --> 25:22.589
- Yeah.
- You're good? Okay.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.590
I'll be right back.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.892
I don't like Katie.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.761
But what I have said about her

25:28.795 --> 25:31.363
is very, very f---ed up.

25:31.397 --> 25:35.134
So just human being
to human being,

25:35.167 --> 25:37.103
I owe this bitch an apology.

25:42.609 --> 25:46.713
Hi. Do you care if I talk
to you for one second?

25:46.746 --> 25:50.983
I know you're upset
at not only me

25:51.017 --> 25:56.188
but things that I've obviously
said to you and about you.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.992
I obviously have been
throwing rocks at you.

26:00.026 --> 26:03.630
- When I open up my phone,
and I see some sh--

26:03.630 --> 26:04.797
like talking about,

26:04.831 --> 26:06.432
"Oh, the only thing
you regret in life

26:06.465 --> 26:07.800
"is not taking your top
off more

26:07.834 --> 26:09.902
in front of Tom Schwartz,"
and, you know,

26:09.936 --> 26:11.537
"Tom's got a big d---,
and you want to f--- him."

26:11.638 --> 26:13.539
- And if you listen
to me really quickly,

26:13.640 --> 26:16.542
I'm not coming out here
to argue with you.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.710
- What exactly--
- I wanted to sit out here

26:17.744 --> 26:19.646
and tell you that I apologize

26:19.679 --> 26:21.047
for pulling low f---ing blows

26:21.080 --> 26:22.481
that I've never,
ever meant, only--

26:22.514 --> 26:24.651
- Giving me a f---ing
BS apology?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.418
- It's not a BS apology.

26:26.452 --> 26:27.887
- There's nothing
real about you.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.155
Your f---ing name isn't
your f---ing name even.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.357
- I've been called Lala
since I was a child,

26:31.390 --> 26:32.859
so you got a problem
with that,

26:32.892 --> 26:35.227
take it up with my mama,
girl.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.664
You want to throw rocks at me,

26:37.664 --> 26:41.300
but then when I retaliate,
we're gonna have a problem?

26:41.333 --> 26:43.369
- I don't throw rocks at you.
- You've been throwing rocks.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.671
- What?
Like, for what? Why?

26:44.671 --> 26:45.772
Because I call you,
like, a whore?

26:45.805 --> 26:48.207
Like, well, I mean,

26:48.240 --> 26:49.742
I call it as I see it.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.681
- A whore is somebody
who sucks d---,

26:54.714 --> 26:57.349
many d---s, for money.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.518
I am in a committed
relationship.

26:59.551 --> 27:02.121
He's the only d---
that I'm sucking.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.090
And I call it as I see it.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.392
- Fat? I know. You did.
You told me to my face.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.694
- F--- the fat comments.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.329
I just apologized for that.
Are we gonna hang onto it?

27:10.362 --> 27:11.698
- And it's a bullsh-- apology.
- It's not.

27:11.698 --> 27:12.865
If you were to say
to me right now,

27:12.899 --> 27:14.533
"Katie, I apologize
for calling you a whore,"

27:14.566 --> 27:15.935
I'd be like,
"Girl, we're good."

27:15.968 --> 27:17.203
We all say sh--
that we don't mean.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.940
- Well, I mean,
I don't apologize for that.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.909
- I'm sitting out here
with someone who, like,

27:22.942 --> 27:25.244
wants to sit here
and pretend like--

27:25.277 --> 27:26.746
- I'm also sitting here
with someone pretending

27:26.779 --> 27:28.247
that they haven't had
a married boyfriend.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.816
- Why would--why would--

27:29.849 --> 27:31.884
I don't have
a married boyfriend!

27:31.918 --> 27:33.552
Who are you talking about?

27:33.585 --> 27:35.121
Who is this human being?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.256
- Lala, don't play
f---ing stupid.

27:37.289 --> 27:40.559
- Oh, my God. I'm in
the f---ing Twilight Zone.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.261
- You bought the Range Rover
and all that because--

27:42.294 --> 27:45.865
- If you want a Range Rover,
you can get one too.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.767
350 a month, honey.
It's a lease.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.168
- Yeah, if you put, like,
10 grand down.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.302
I know how leases work.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.204
- I've never had
a bill in my life.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.140
My parents still pay
my phone bill.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.308
Of course, I can afford
a Range Rover.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.344
You want to know
where my Loubs are coming from?

27:58.377 --> 28:01.748
You can thank my mother.
My Chanel bags? My mother.

28:01.748 --> 28:04.016
- [Katie indistinct]
- If it makes you feel better,

28:04.050 --> 28:05.852
you being in the sh-- car
or whatever it is--

28:05.885 --> 28:07.754
I don't know--
then I'm--you know?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.588
- Okay. You're gonna just
throw the thing--

28:09.621 --> 28:10.857
- Yeah.
I'm gonna throw shade,

28:10.890 --> 28:12.391
because I've apologized,
and you keep coming--

28:12.424 --> 28:13.659
- Oh, my God.
You're a f---ing idiot.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.928
You're a f---ing dumb
f---ing idiot.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.931
[dramatic music]

28:18.965 --> 28:21.300
- Mmm...

28:21.333 --> 28:23.469
- Coming up..
- Like, I love him.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.804
- I know.
- I know he loves me.

28:29.408 --> 28:29.876
[upbeat music]

28:34.180 --> 28:36.382
- That's just the rest of it.
I already put a bunch of sh--

28:36.415 --> 28:38.350
in the fridge and everything.
I got a lotta stuff.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.619
Aren't people
supposed to bring stuff over?

28:40.652 --> 28:42.388
I feel like we're constantly
throwing parties for people.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.655
- I mean, I told some people
to bring some--

28:43.689 --> 28:45.357
- Engagement parties, weddings,
home-warming parties--

28:45.391 --> 28:46.959
Shouldn't they bring
us stuff sometimes?

28:46.993 --> 28:48.260
We have this big
wedding coming up.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.561
It's gonna be super-expensive.

28:49.595 --> 28:52.799
Everyone gets to eat
and drink on our tab,

28:52.832 --> 28:55.201
and I'm throwing this
little housewarming party.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.303
Everyone gets to eat
and drink on our tab.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.504
It sucks!

28:58.537 --> 29:00.339
Do we have little toothpicks?
- Yep.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.809
- Why do people have to pay
for their own weddings?

29:02.809 --> 29:03.976
I feel like weddings

29:04.010 --> 29:05.878
should be crowdsourced
or crowdfunded, right?

29:05.912 --> 29:08.380
Did you put the order in
for the invitations?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.481
Are they expensive?

29:09.515 --> 29:11.818
- Uh...
- Bubba...

29:11.818 --> 29:13.853
- I really want this.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.188
- They better not be
more than $5 apiece.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.957
- They're, like, 18 apiece.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.927
- What? No. Bubba--

29:20.960 --> 29:23.029
- They're really nice.
- 18--dude, we can't.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.530
- That's, like--
it's what people spend--

29:24.563 --> 29:25.932
- Don't say, "That's standard."
- That is!

29:25.965 --> 29:27.433
- No, no, no, no, no,
- It is. You don't know!

29:27.466 --> 29:28.700
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:28.734 --> 29:29.836
- Have you been married before?

29:29.836 --> 29:33.205
- Standard idiocrasy--idiocy.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.374
Maybe I'm living
in a fantasy land,

29:35.407 --> 29:37.309
but I feel like I could
throw a pretty decent wedding

29:37.343 --> 29:39.245
for $3,000,

29:39.278 --> 29:41.680
and that barely covers
our invitations.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.415
How was Sur last night?
Was it busy?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.084
- Well, like, last night
was good,

29:45.117 --> 29:46.752
except for when
I was on my break

29:46.853 --> 29:48.420
just trying to,
like, have a moment,

29:48.454 --> 29:51.557
Lala comes out
and starts giving me some,

29:51.590 --> 29:53.159
like apology.
I mean--

29:53.192 --> 29:54.861
- All right.
Well, that's good. That's good.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.495
- I just feel like it was
a bullsh-- apology.

29:56.528 --> 29:57.864
It's, like, just irritating.

29:57.897 --> 29:58.965
- Yeah.
- And it's just the whole thing,

29:58.998 --> 30:00.867
and then, I, like,
was looking for Scheana,

30:00.900 --> 30:02.869
and then I saw her, like,
talking with Lala, I was like...

30:02.902 --> 30:04.971
It was the end of the night,

30:05.004 --> 30:06.973
and I walked into
the lounge bar

30:07.006 --> 30:10.076
and I saw Scheana at the bar,
and I saw Lala at the bar.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.678
And not only was
Scheana facing Lala,

30:12.711 --> 30:15.447
she was talking to her,
and she was laughing.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.283
Like, what the f---
are you thinking, Scheana?

30:17.316 --> 30:20.419
- Banana chip in moderation.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.588
Look at this spread.
It's coming together.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.193
- If you have a charcuterie
platter at your party,

30:27.226 --> 30:28.995
you're an adult.
- Yeah.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.229
- And then we can tell people

30:30.262 --> 30:32.531
there's, like,
beer and wine in the fridge.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.633
- Bubby, do you want to do
a little celebratory shot?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.302
Cheers.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.105
- It was good.
- Ooh, it finishes nice, huh?

30:39.138 --> 30:41.507
Let's have a f---ing party.
- [chuckles]

30:41.540 --> 30:43.175
[energetic music]

30:43.209 --> 30:46.778
- * We never stop,
we never stop *

30:46.812 --> 30:50.449
* We never stop, we never
stop *

30:50.482 --> 30:52.718
* We never stop,
we never stop... *

30:52.751 --> 30:53.886
- Hey, you haven't been
here yet.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.454
- Yeah.

30:55.487 --> 30:59.691
- Is everybody--is anybody here?
- Any minute.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.260
So I'm making a drink

31:01.293 --> 31:04.430
so I can be a host
and greet people and be,

31:04.463 --> 31:06.498
you know, socially lubricated
at the same time.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.267
- Yeah.
[knock at door]

31:08.300 --> 31:09.268
- Hello.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.170
- Oh, hey, guys. Hello.
- Hello.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.739
- Oh, you brought me a present.
- Yeah.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.441
- Thank you. Hi.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.376
You look so cute.
You got all dressed up.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.646
- It's a little terrarium.
- That's f---ing awesome.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.448
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, Shay, welcome.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.150
- You've got to give him
the grand tour.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.551
- I know. What is this?

31:25.584 --> 31:28.154
- Present.
That's also for you.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.123
Things this year
have been amazing so far.

31:31.157 --> 31:34.560
Shay and I are literally in the
best place we've ever been in.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.098
- The place is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.533
I know.
It's really nice.

31:41.567 --> 31:45.104
I'm gonna ask them if they have
any bottles of water.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.074
He hasn't drank
since last December.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.508
We were just saying
the other day,

31:49.541 --> 31:52.478
like, we're happier today
than the day we got married.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.480
So we were really
happy that day.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.649
- Hey, dude.
- Yo, yo, yo.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.118
- So this is really good,

31:59.151 --> 32:01.153
but you definitely
shouldn't eat it, because...

32:01.187 --> 32:03.422
- Not good for the abs?
- We'll all suffer.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.224
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.859
- What's up, man?
- Listen, we kind of have

32:07.893 --> 32:09.628
to get this
bachelor party going.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.763
- I know--
- We're gonna get transvestites.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.766
- No. Not a transvestites--no.
- Or a transgender.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.003
- Just--no, no, no, no,
no, no, Jax, no.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.504
No, no, no, no.
- Yes!

32:18.537 --> 32:19.705
- Listen, listen--
- I need this.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.173
Who gives a sh--
about the wedding?

32:21.207 --> 32:22.741
I'm excited to plan the party.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.677
Strippers, Vegas, women,

32:25.711 --> 32:28.680
all the boys around--
this is gonna be epic.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.916
- Maybe we'll get
a guy dressed in drag.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.518
- Okay. That's the same thing.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.020
- Just a guy dressed in drag.
- It's not the same thing.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.687
- It's not the same thing, Jax.
- Okay.

32:35.721 --> 32:41.860
*

32:52.504 --> 32:55.174
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.510
- What's wrong?
- No. I'm fine.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.047
I don't know.
Maybe, like,

33:01.080 --> 33:02.814
you're the best person
to talk about it,

33:02.848 --> 33:04.483
because I don't talk about it
with anybody, like,

33:04.516 --> 33:06.652
"Oh, how's Patrick,"
or da-da-da.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.720
I'm like, I feel like
everybody knows not to ask me,

33:08.754 --> 33:11.657
because it's either
we're together or we're not,

33:11.690 --> 33:13.859
and it's always flipping
and flopping,

33:13.892 --> 33:15.694
and I'm embarrassed by that.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.829
I'm sure that Katie
and Kristen are sick

33:17.863 --> 33:19.865
of hearing me talk about me
and Patrick's relationship,

33:19.898 --> 33:22.101
but I need somebody to talk to.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.635
I mean, misery loves company,

33:23.669 --> 33:25.237
but it's really hard
to find company

33:25.271 --> 33:26.938
when all your friends
are so f---ing happy.

33:26.972 --> 33:29.175
It's just a f---ing
sh---y pattern.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.809
I feel like I'm going crazy.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.344
- No. You're--don't.
- So, like, every time, like,

33:32.378 --> 33:33.545
I try and explain it
to somebody,

33:33.579 --> 33:34.713
I'm like, "I don't know.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.149
"Like, I don't know
what the problem is.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.485
I don't know.
Like, I love him."

33:39.518 --> 33:40.786
- Don't cry. I know.
- "I know he loves me.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.388
I know all of that.
I know."

33:42.421 --> 33:44.390
- Oh, stop.
Please, don't cry. Please.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.325
- No. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bother you.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.729
I just want to hide right now.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.164
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- I feel so embarrassed.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.865
- Don't be embarrassed.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.801
If you need to talk
to somebody, talk to me.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.703
I promise,
I will be there for you,

33:57.736 --> 33:59.538
and I'm not gonna judge you.
I'm not gonna be annoyed

33:59.571 --> 34:02.808
that you called me once a week
upset about something.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.009
Okay?
- Are you really--

34:04.110 --> 34:06.145
are you being honest?
- No. I swear to God.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.314
Pinky-promise.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.249
[both laughing]

34:10.282 --> 34:13.419
Here.
Chug some of my vodka soda.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.726
- Coming up...
- Dude, that ass

34:20.759 --> 34:22.394
is nowhere to be found.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.796
She used to have
a f---ing ass.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.265
- I know.
What happened to her?

34:31.203 --> 34:33.739
*

34:37.176 --> 34:38.577
[knock on door]

34:44.150 --> 34:46.518
- Hello.
- Hello, Papi.

34:46.552 --> 34:47.953
James and I--we're homies.

34:47.986 --> 34:49.588
We share things with each other.

34:49.621 --> 34:50.922
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah.

34:50.956 --> 34:53.492
It's nice to have people
that have your back.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.493
[pop]
- Oh!

34:54.526 --> 34:56.061
Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.365
So how'd your night
go last night?

34:59.398 --> 35:03.235
- Dude, with the Katie thing,
she was just not having it.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.971
I will say that girl
is not nice.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.539
She's just not a kind person.

35:07.573 --> 35:08.840
She's a f---ing bitch.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.976
- She didn't really
accept my apology either.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.845
Like, she just gave me
the doll face, you know?

35:13.879 --> 35:15.981
I just wanted to take
a minute and say sorry.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.517
- I just think you're, like,
a horrible person.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.286
- I don't give a sh--.
Just, like, get over it.

35:20.319 --> 35:21.453
- I feel good.
- I said I'm sorry to you.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.454
- I said I'm sorry too.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.589
- Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.656
- So I can walk away
with my hands clean.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.192
But the thing
that bothers me--

35:26.225 --> 35:29.661
she brought up that
I'm dating a married dude,

35:29.695 --> 35:31.363
and I don't know
where it's coming from.

35:31.397 --> 35:34.400
- That's a very harsh
accusation there.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.203
Lala hasn't told me anything
about whoever she's dating.

35:37.203 --> 35:40.406
But I'm gonna step away from it,
because let's be honest.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.607
I haven't got many friends
in this group,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.209
and Lala's definitely
one of them,

35:43.209 --> 35:45.211
and I don't want to lose her
as a friend.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.246
- They're all over having
a housewarming party

35:47.279 --> 35:49.348
for Katie and Schwartz.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.618
- [fake sobs] I'm not invited.
- [laughs]

35:52.651 --> 35:55.086
- So what do you think's
happening at this "party?"

35:55.120 --> 35:56.455
- What do you think
is happening at this party?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.689
- I think--okay.
I think it's a bunch of

35:57.723 --> 36:00.959
f---ing thems being thems,
being basic as f---,

36:00.992 --> 36:03.729
sitting on the f---ing couch,
drinking wine.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.832
Jax is on his way
to getting lit as f---.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.234
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

36:08.234 --> 36:10.068
- I bet you Tom and Ariana

36:10.101 --> 36:11.437
are wishing
they weren't there.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.472
- [whistling sounds]

36:13.505 --> 36:15.407
- I feel like they may
be having fun,

36:15.441 --> 36:17.409
but it's gonna be
talking sh-- on us.

36:17.443 --> 36:20.246
- Don't let them make you
feel excluded.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.547
I can make one phone call.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.914
We'll have a party right here,
right now before Pump.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.983
- Should we just do it?
- I'll get too lit,

36:25.016 --> 36:27.419
and then I'll get fired
from Pump, and this is not good.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.720
I'm not even trying
to come close to fired.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.456
I want to get promoted again.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.924
- Yeah. You want to DJ
from the rooftop.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.661
- Then I'm gonna DJ
from a plane.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.063
Then I'm gonna DJ.
They're gonna go insane.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.498
- Oh, God. All right.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.438
- Lemons,

36:46.472 --> 36:49.140
the limes--know your colors.

36:49.174 --> 36:52.043
Know your fruits, Katie.
It's not hard.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.012
- Dude, that ass
is nowhere to be found.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.348
She used to have
a f---ing ass.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.751
*

36:59.785 --> 37:01.387
- Who's that at the pool?
Who is that?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.721
- Scheana.
- That's Scheana?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.356
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

37:05.657 --> 37:07.426
- I know--
What happened to her?

37:07.459 --> 37:08.560
- Why is she so skinny?

37:08.594 --> 37:09.761
I'm not hitting on her.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.063
But she used to be so curvy,
like, you know?

37:12.097 --> 37:14.132
It's gone.
It's nowhere to be found.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.068
- There's a little bit of this.
- Thank you.

37:17.102 --> 37:18.304
- Do you guys want to see

37:18.304 --> 37:20.138
my rearranging of furniture
in my bedroom?

37:20.171 --> 37:21.607
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.476
You know I love a good
interior-design situation.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.744
- Come, come.

37:27.145 --> 37:31.016
- Oh, my God.
- God, it looks so good.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.718
- It's industrial-chic,

37:32.751 --> 37:34.620
but also,
it's not just industrial-chic.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.323
It's, like,
industrial-chic-eclectic.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.591
- I just went, like, crazy
and bought sh-- that [murmurs].

37:39.625 --> 37:42.594
But I have to tell you guys
about last night,

37:42.628 --> 37:43.995
like away from everyone else...
- Oh, yeah.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.997
Just because--I don't know.
But I go to work last night,

37:46.031 --> 37:47.599
and Lala was there.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.501
She wants to apologize,
so I was like, "Okay.

37:49.535 --> 37:50.769
Let's f---ing talk about it."

37:50.802 --> 37:52.003
Don't come up
and acting like--

37:52.037 --> 37:53.339
acting like you're
a self-worth person

37:53.372 --> 37:54.740
and you're owning your sh--

37:54.773 --> 37:57.343
when I heard she's also
sucking a married dude's d---.

37:57.343 --> 38:00.412
- We've all heard about Lala
sleeping with a married man,

38:00.446 --> 38:03.515
but Katie had the balls
to say it to her face,

38:03.549 --> 38:05.451
and I'm so proud of that.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.186
- She acted like she had no clue
what I was talking about.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.021
- She literally denied
the whole thing?

38:10.055 --> 38:11.390
- And then, I told her,
"Like, you think I'm stupid.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.558
Like, you're sitting here,
lying to my face."

38:12.591 --> 38:15.627
And it was information
that was offered to me.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.763
I wasn't--I don't have, like,
a private detective f---ing

38:17.796 --> 38:19.365
following you around.

38:19.365 --> 38:22.534
- She is a ----.

38:22.568 --> 38:25.704
Lala is like
a sociopathic skank.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.406
There's no other way around it.

38:27.439 --> 38:30.642
You don't date a married man
and then deny and lie.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.811
She's f---ing insane.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.413
Straight-up--
- I know.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.747
I don't even like that word,

38:35.781 --> 38:36.848
and, like,
I'm gonna say it.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.217
- And then, she's--
- ----.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.251
- You weren't at work
last night.

38:40.285 --> 38:41.252
- No. You weren't.
- What happened?

38:41.286 --> 38:43.722
- You missed
the apology tour 2016.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.757
- Whose apology tour?
- Guess.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.092
We have a headliner this year.
- So wait a minute.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.160
Scheana--okay. Lala.
- Yep.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.430
- Oh, how's it going?
- Katie said,

38:51.463 --> 38:53.465
"If you're being dishonest
about half of your life,

38:53.499 --> 38:55.467
how do I know you're being
honest in this apology?"

38:55.501 --> 38:57.068
- Good one.
- Not say you don't

38:57.102 --> 38:58.470
have a point, however,

38:58.504 --> 39:01.673
being dishonest about one thing
does not snowball into,

39:01.707 --> 39:03.241
"You're just
a dishonest person."

39:03.274 --> 39:04.576
- But it kind of does.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.144
How can I be friends
with someone I can't trust,

39:06.177 --> 39:07.846
because you are
a dishonest person?

39:07.879 --> 39:09.481
- Well, she--her life
is none of y'all's business.

39:09.515 --> 39:10.849
- I know.
- You work with her at Sur,

39:10.882 --> 39:13.084
at a f---ing restaurant.
- The point was,

39:13.118 --> 39:15.421
she lies
about a lot of things.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.724
So to me, she just seems fake
and seems like a--like a liar.

39:18.757 --> 39:22.494
I am fully on-board,
100% Team Katie.

39:22.528 --> 39:25.296
Ariana on the other hand,
is a little more Team Lala,

39:25.330 --> 39:27.165
forgetting she's friends
with Katie,

39:27.198 --> 39:28.700
and if something doesn't happen,

39:28.734 --> 39:31.169
there is gonna be a huge rift
in this friendship.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.871
So later I'm like,
"Okay. Like, where's Scheana?"

39:32.904 --> 39:34.339
I go looking for her,
and then, I, like, find her,

39:34.440 --> 39:35.541
and, like--and it's, like,

39:35.574 --> 39:37.342
her and then Scheana,
like, at the bar,

39:37.443 --> 39:38.744
and I'm like, "Cool."

39:38.777 --> 39:39.911
- Sh--.
- No way.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.280
I could not imagine
being at a f---ing bar

39:42.313 --> 39:45.551
with Lala,
even giving like a--that.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.553
I couldn't even give her
a hair flip in a bitchy way,

39:47.586 --> 39:48.854
because I don't even want
to acknowledge her

39:48.887 --> 39:50.556
because of how awful she's been.

39:50.589 --> 39:53.459
- I can't fake a smile and fake
a--fake a friendship

39:53.459 --> 39:54.693
or [stammers].
- No sh--.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.794
- Like, I don't--
I'm not good at that.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.463
- It freaks me out.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.830
I think Scheana kind of needs
to just, like,

39:58.864 --> 40:01.833
take a second to recognize
that she needs to fall in line,

40:01.867 --> 40:04.736
because if you're claiming
we're all your best friends,

40:04.770 --> 40:07.005
then you don't go
and chummy up to Lala.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.540
Home girl better figure it out.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.811
- Hey, gossip girls.
- Major gossip girls.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.780
- You've been in here forever.
- Uh, yeah--

40:14.813 --> 40:16.381
- You've got to be out
of your drink by now.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.850
- Just got filled in.
I need to go.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.887
- I just had
the same conversation. Yeah.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.495
- Hey, gossip girls.
- I need to go.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.698
I'm going.

40:32.731 --> 40:33.932
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.568
- I'm, like, oh, the party.
I'm like,

40:36.602 --> 40:38.269
"Oh, I guess I'm holding court
in my bedroom." No.

40:38.303 --> 40:39.738
I was just, like, telling all
of them, like, what the f---.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.974
It's just, dude--I mean,
truthfully, though, like

40:43.008 --> 40:45.711
last night did kind of, like,
sit uneasy with me, though.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.378
Like, I was like,
"Where is Scheana?

40:47.412 --> 40:49.314
Where's Scheana?" And I walk up
to the bar, and I'm like,

40:49.347 --> 40:50.849
I saw you talking to Lala

40:50.882 --> 40:53.284
and being friendly with her.
Like, that was--

40:53.318 --> 40:55.353
- Well, that's where
I was standing first,

40:55.386 --> 40:56.722
and then she walked up...
- I'm not saying--

40:56.755 --> 40:58.389
- And then I came back,
and I'm like, well, what?

40:58.423 --> 41:00.025
Am I gonna go
stand somewhere by myself?

41:00.058 --> 41:02.027
- I'm not--I'm not accusing.
I'm not, like, upset about that.

41:02.060 --> 41:06.532
But I'm just like, um...
Okay, this is uncomfortable.

41:06.565 --> 41:07.599
I'm not sitting here,
being like,

41:07.633 --> 41:09.234
"Are you gonna be friends
with her?"

41:09.267 --> 41:10.569
But I'm just saying, like,
I, like, went up--

41:10.602 --> 41:11.837
- Hell, no.
- I was like--I just--I just--

41:11.870 --> 41:13.539
- You seem really upset,
and it was, like,

41:13.539 --> 41:16.542
completely taken out of context,
what you're thinking right now.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.309
- I'm just asking for,
like, support.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.679
I don't need to be,
like, corrected.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.413
- I'm not going to
talk to her.

41:22.447 --> 41:23.849
I don't care to be friends
with her.

41:23.882 --> 41:26.552
- It just looks like my friends
are questioning my decisions

41:26.552 --> 41:29.287
and potentially protecting
or defending someone else's.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.556
- I didn't question
anything.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.790
I hate when people tell me

41:31.823 --> 41:33.825
I've said something
I haven't said.

41:33.859 --> 41:37.629
Everything you think
happened actually didn't.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.964
- I feel like now that, like,

41:38.997 --> 41:41.567
she feels comfortable
coming and talking to you,

41:41.567 --> 41:43.201
because you've let her
know that's okay--

41:43.234 --> 41:44.570
- Well, then
I'll shut that down.

41:44.570 --> 41:45.671
- I'm not saying
that's what you should do.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.739
I'm just saying
it was very unexpected.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.575
- And I'm sorry for that.
- So I was like, "Oh."

41:49.575 --> 41:52.377
- You keep saying that I said
something I didn't say.

41:52.410 --> 41:55.013
- I don't feel like I should
have to explain to Scheana

41:55.046 --> 41:56.582
why her being friendly

41:56.582 --> 41:59.250
and chatting
with Lala is not cool.

41:59.284 --> 42:02.888
I mean, Scheana's a smart girl.
I mean, she should get it.

42:02.921 --> 42:06.257
- I 100% support you, and you
should go back to your party.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.693
- It's--I know I should.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.262
You know...

42:19.037 --> 42:21.072
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:21.106 --> 42:23.408
- I think I want you
to officially be a groomsman.

42:23.441 --> 42:27.779
- Oh, my God.
- There is a catch.

42:27.813 --> 42:29.280
- You don't f---ing ever listen.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.415
It's like being
in a relationship

42:30.448 --> 42:31.617
with the f---ing wall.

42:31.650 --> 42:32.984
- Well, Bubba, when you go
to the dark side,

42:33.018 --> 42:34.886
it's f---ing scary as hell.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.388
- You have an issue,
and that's not what, like,

42:37.422 --> 42:39.224
a real,
solid friendship is like.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.326
- I didn't know I was
coming over to get attacked.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.761
- You can't go a day
without getting your ass kicked.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.095
- Because I'm a rock star,
and you're a bartender.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.631
So you need to take an order.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.833
More cosmopolitans.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.234
Pop-tini!

42:49.267 --> 42:51.637
- You've turned
into a drunken asshole.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.673
- I don't know
how to control it.

42:54.706 --> 42:57.676

Rules," go to BravoTV.com.
