[woman]
Last time onNaomi...

00:02.654 --> 00:04.308
Every good UFO investigator
has gear.

00:04.352 --> 00:06.136
He thinks aliens are real.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.095
[Naomi] A few weeks ago,
I was living a normal life.

00:08.138 --> 00:12.012
You are a lot of things, babe,
but normal is not one of them.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.884
Change happens.
And now,
I'm a high-school dropout.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.626
-What are you doing here?
-You don't even go to school.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.410
[Naomi]
I found out I have powers.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.933
Why do I have to learn
how to fight?

00:20.977 --> 00:23.284
It is easy for powers
to become a crutch.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.590
[Naomi] All this time,
I thought you were my enemy.

00:25.634 --> 00:28.071
[Zumbado]
I made your parents a promise
I would keep you safe.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.725
You're gonna save our world.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.598
Your mental game is key.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.078
There will always be obstacles,

00:35.122 --> 00:36.949
but don't let them
shake your confidence.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.561
Think of obstacles
as opportunities
to refine your skill.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.475
I got this.

00:41.954 --> 00:42.781
I'm ready.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.481
[splashes]

00:46.524 --> 00:48.004
[sighs]

00:48.048 --> 00:50.441
Don't worry. The water trap
comes for us all.

00:50.485 --> 00:54.010
She's right.
It took me months
to master this course.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
Wait until you get
to the windmill.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.884
Looks like we'll just have to
practice together more often.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.408
I guess I'd be okay with that.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.453

-[all cheering]

01:08.329 --> 01:09.460
Nice!

01:12.637 --> 01:15.466
Wind is minimal.
You have a clear shot.

01:17.903 --> 01:18.730
Yes!

01:20.210 --> 01:21.081
Do you ever win?

01:22.256 --> 01:24.171
-Definitely not.
-Okay.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.238
-[voices stop]
-[Naomi gasps]

01:48.282 --> 01:50.371
I needed to exchange
the grip on my club.

01:50.414 --> 01:51.328
This one's all wrong.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.202
You okay, babe?

01:56.725 --> 01:58.379
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:56.741 --> 02:57.960
What's all this?

02:58.003 --> 02:59.266
[speaking French]

03:01.616 --> 03:03.705
Happy anniversary.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.881
You recreated
our favorite meal

03:05.924 --> 03:07.926
from our honeymoon in France.

03:07.970 --> 03:11.365
Croissants, quiche, lattes.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.150
This was very thoughtful.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.717
Wait until you see
what I have planned
for the party.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.113
Actually, we're, um,

03:21.157 --> 03:23.464
thinking of cancelling.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.944
[scoffs] What?

03:25.988 --> 03:27.772
You've been planning this party
for months.

03:27.816 --> 03:31.036
It's just not a good time.
[chuckles nervously]

03:31.080 --> 03:34.170
It's your 20th anniversary.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.826
Naomi, all we care about
is that we're healthy
and happy.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.871
That... That you're healthy
and happy.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.268
Is this because of me?

03:45.312 --> 03:46.878
-[stutters] No. No.
-[Naomi] Dad.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.271
I can always tell
when you're lying

03:48.315 --> 03:49.577
because you do that...
You do that thing

03:49.620 --> 03:50.273
where you scrunch up
your forehead.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.235
With all that's been going on,

03:55.278 --> 03:56.714
it's better
to be extra careful.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.151
I'm fine.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.066
You can't cancel this party
because of me.

04:02.024 --> 04:02.981
Please.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.073
I'm making a slideshow.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.033
[both chuckle]

04:13.949 --> 04:15.516
[exhales]

04:15.559 --> 04:18.301
Okay, party is still on.
But we are keeping it small.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.215
Deal.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.391
I'll see you after school.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.273
[heart thumping]

04:33.316 --> 04:34.535
[Greg] It's the best thing
for us to do.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.450
[Jennifer] She loves
Port Oswego.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.843
Are we really gonna
uproot her again?

04:38.887 --> 04:40.323
[Greg] She's not safe here.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.716
We have to
at least consider it.

-[school bell rings]

[announcer on loudspeakers]
Good afternoon, Ducks.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.289
Your Community
Service Week assignments

04:49.332 --> 04:50.899
will be given out shortly.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.379
[Annabelle] Am I having
a nightmare?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.250
That is literally
the only acceptable scenario

04:54.294 --> 04:55.817
-in which you moving is okay.
-[locker slams shut]

04:55.860 --> 04:57.514
Nothing is for sure yet.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.429
I can't believe Greg
and Jen would betray me.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.257
I made them
friendship bracelets.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.390
Pitch legal emancipation.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.348
My cousin's a lawyer,
and I'm pretty sure

05:05.392 --> 05:06.436
that we can pay her
in babysitting.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.829
I'm not divorcing my parents.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.962
Moving may not be
the worst idea.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.270
Okay, now I know
I'm having a nightmare.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.621
You want to leave Port Oswego?

05:17.665 --> 05:19.493
No. I love it here.

05:20.494 --> 05:21.408
It's just, like...

05:22.931 --> 05:24.498
Maybe it's the only way
to make sure

05:24.541 --> 05:25.847
no one around me gets hurt.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.284
If you move,
I would be very hurt.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.286
I'm talking actual
physical harm.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.722
Things are getting dangerous.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.376
First, that thing
with the bounty hunter,

05:33.420 --> 05:35.160
and then everything
that happened with Dr. Bell--

05:35.204 --> 05:37.467
B-T-W, still can't believe
we're friends with Zumbado.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.341
And now there's
this Brutus person.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.474
Zumbado said
he'll come after me.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.389
I've seen your powers.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.087
You can take down
a space warlord.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.567
I'm not sure I can.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.353
And if I am a target,

05:53.396 --> 05:55.485
that means everyone
around me is, too.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.747
You can't move.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.185
I'm not sure I have a choice.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.102
[school bell ringing]

06:06.714 --> 06:09.717
A strike
is the most useful move.

06:11.022 --> 06:11.893
That is the key.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.332
I did it.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.290
-Yes, you did.
-[Zumbado] What's next?

06:18.334 --> 06:19.291
Shadow boxing?

06:23.426 --> 06:25.297
Something wrong?

06:25.341 --> 06:27.735
Just wondering,
what are you expecting her
to do with that?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.826
Mastering a weapon
is about discipline.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.394
[Zumbado] Hmm.

06:34.437 --> 06:39.834
By developing feel
and trust in your instincts.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.096
[Naomi] I've seen Dee
use these.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.185
They seem pretty lethal.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.099
Maybe.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.363
If you're fighting humans.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.628
They won't help you
against Brutus, Naomi.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.021
Dee's a good teacher.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.109
I'm sure he is.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.460
But the only way
that you'll get better

06:57.504 --> 07:01.377
at controlling your powers
is by using them.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.293
Didn't you say using my powers
are a magnet?

07:04.336 --> 07:06.077
She's right.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.515
The more she uses her powers,

07:08.558 --> 07:11.779
the more she risks
drawing the attention
of her enemies.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.258
[Zumbado]
We're beyond that now.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.391
Enemies are likely
already on their way.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.916
And they won't be stopped
by using a... A staff.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.397
-Our training is working.
-It's not enough.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.487
I'm not changing my approach.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.624
Then perhaps it's time for her
to find a new teacher.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.628
I appreciate you both
looking out for me.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.238
Both of you. Really.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.850
But Dee's right.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.983
Our training has been working.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.464
And using my powers
will just put us all in danger.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.424
We're in danger
either way, Naomi.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.649
You know that.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.621
[Annabelle]
Where are Greg and Jen
on their anniversary tour?

08:11.665 --> 08:15.407
Tonight, they're recreating
date number five.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.540
They call it, "The three Bs."

08:17.584 --> 08:19.673
Burgers, budinos and bowling.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.718
[chuckles] Tomorrow
is their overnight trip.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.546
They are truly adorable.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.113
It is so hard
to stay mad at them.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.114
[distinct creaking]

08:27.855 --> 08:28.769
[whispering] I hear something.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.380
Maybe it's just the wind?

08:31.423 --> 08:32.512
[creaking continues]

08:33.643 --> 08:34.601
[whispering] Stay here.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.254
Alone?

08:36.864 --> 08:37.734
No way!

08:43.653 --> 08:44.654
Someone was in here.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.440
Why didn't they take anything?

08:48.484 --> 08:50.573
Like your expensive laptop.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.792
Maybe they weren't here
for that.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.756
Someone stole the disc.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.116
[dogs barking]

09:12.160 --> 09:13.509
When Miss Anderson said
we were gonna be getting

09:13.553 --> 09:14.902
up close and personal
with the dogs,

09:14.945 --> 09:17.600
I was picturing
something very different.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.124
What did Greg and Jen say
about the stolen disc?

09:20.168 --> 09:21.561
I didn't tell them.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.739
Probably for the best.
I mean, we don't want
to accelerate

09:25.782 --> 09:28.611
project "Ruin Annabelle's Life
By Moving Naomi
Out of Port Oswego."

09:31.222 --> 09:32.528
What did Dee and Zumbado say?

09:34.356 --> 09:36.532
I didn't tell them either.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.925
They can't even agree
on my training.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.362
If they found out
an alien stole my disc,

09:40.405 --> 09:42.277
they'd never
let me leave my house.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.149
An alien?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.586
Maybe it was just
your regular
run-of-the-mill burglar.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.152
Who only stole the disc?

09:49.893 --> 09:52.940
I just have to handle this
on my own.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.943
You mean "we" have to
handle this on "our" own?

09:58.293 --> 10:01.078
Babe, if we're hunting aliens,
you're gonna need my help.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.341
[Jacob] Alien hunting?
I'm so in.

10:03.385 --> 10:04.865
Jacob, hi! We were--

10:04.908 --> 10:07.345
Talking about the explosion
at STAR Labs.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.654
Right?

10:11.698 --> 10:13.308
I didn't say anything,
I promise.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.571
[Jacob scoffs] There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.921
I've been a loyal subscriber
for years.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.793
I know some people think
it's a little fringe--

10:19.836 --> 10:20.924
Wait, what are you
talking about?

10:25.059 --> 10:26.843
Um, Otherworlds Weekly.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.932
There was a post
there today theorizing

10:28.976 --> 10:31.848
that there were aliens
at STAR Labs.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.720
Isn't that what you guys
were talking about?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.157
-Yes.
-Yeah.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.202
Right, that's what
we were talking about, hon.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.770
What are you doing here?

10:40.814 --> 10:42.772
I'm picking up
Groucho Barx. [chuckles]

10:42.816 --> 10:44.556
He has a standing
monthly appointment.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.211
Oh, what did the post say
about STAR Labs?

10:47.255 --> 10:48.691
Some people
on the message boards

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
think that they had technology

10:50.475 --> 10:52.826
that could detect aliens
walking among us.

10:57.482 --> 11:00.050
I'm actually working
on a prototype myself.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.445
It uses the principles
of mechanoreceptors
in the skin.

11:03.488 --> 11:04.838
[cell phone notification
chimes]

11:08.406 --> 11:09.886
Zumbado wants me to meet him.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.540
-Can you finish up for me?
-[Annabelle] Yeah.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.241
Hey, are we friends
with Zumbado now?

11:17.285 --> 11:18.678
That's what I said.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.909
Thank you for meeting me.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.606
What are we doing here?

11:34.650 --> 11:35.564
[Zumbado] Training.

11:37.784 --> 11:38.915
Where's Dee?

11:38.959 --> 11:41.439
This session is just us, Naomi.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.963
I know you're just trying
to help me,

11:43.006 --> 11:45.269
but I've been training
with Dee for a while,

11:46.227 --> 11:47.750
and it's helping.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.665
I know. But the skills
that he's teaching you

11:49.709 --> 11:51.362
aren't the only ones
that you need.

11:54.844 --> 11:55.889
I want to see if you can fly.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.674
[Naomi laughs]

11:58.718 --> 12:00.458
No, I definitely can't fly.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.461
How do you know?
Have you tried?

12:03.505 --> 12:05.507
I'm afraid of heights.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.509
That's not
a good answer, Naomi.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.729
-I already jumped off a bridge.
-And what happened?

12:11.469 --> 12:14.603
When I got to the water,
I felt like I was floating.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.912
It's a power called
"weight negation."

12:18.955 --> 12:21.479
So, if I can do that,
then why do I need to fly?

12:24.221 --> 12:27.007
A lot of people assume
that flying
is about convenience,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.228
but it's not.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.144
Flying is about letting go
of all the things
that hold you back.

12:35.842 --> 12:36.756
It's about power.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.193
Strength.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.459
I believe
you have that potential.

12:48.593 --> 12:49.681
I don't think I'm ready.

12:51.727 --> 12:52.597
If you let me help you,

12:53.990 --> 12:55.252
one day you will be.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.780
[rock music playing
over speakers]

13:02.825 --> 13:05.480
I don't think I've actually
been in here before.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.612
-Have you?
-Only when Naomi drags me here.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.703
This is unexpected.

13:13.575 --> 13:17.622
We are here
for community service.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.103
You guys are
my student volunteers?

13:20.147 --> 13:23.454
So, uh, if you could just
sign here, we'll get out
of your way.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.457
-Seriously?
-Well, we kind of thought

13:26.501 --> 13:27.807
you'd take it easy on us

13:27.850 --> 13:30.070
since we're, you know...

13:30.113 --> 13:32.289
-[both laugh]
-No, actually I don't.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.509
Because we're friends and all.

13:34.552 --> 13:37.642
Right. No, that's not
how this is gonna work.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.644
Is this about me and Naomi?

13:39.688 --> 13:43.605
Because if it is,
I am also not dating Naomi.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.521
So, you and I
are in this together.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.306
-Wow.
-Yeah, my dad signed us up
for Community Service Week

13:49.350 --> 13:50.960
because he wanted me
to have help.

13:51.004 --> 13:54.659
So, the only way
I'm signing this
is if you help.

13:54.703 --> 13:58.272
No disrespect,
but it's lowkey empty in here.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.579
There are over
a thousand comics
in this store.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.973
New stock get cycled in,
old stock gets cycled out.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.496
And it all becomes a big mess.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.717
And you guys are gonna
organize everything.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.330
The whole store?

14:14.505 --> 14:15.463
The whole store.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.208
[both sigh]

14:21.251 --> 14:23.645
[Annabelle on phone]
You're at STAR Labs alone?

14:23.688 --> 14:25.647
[Naomi on phone] I just
need to check something out.
I'll be careful.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.243
[door opens]

15:00.769 --> 15:04.251
Hello? If there are
aliens here, I come in peace.

15:07.819 --> 15:08.864
Jacob?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.736
Naomi?

15:11.780 --> 15:13.042
What are you doing here?

15:13.086 --> 15:15.088
I couldn't pass
on the opportunity

15:15.131 --> 15:18.439
to explore a secret
alien lab. [chuckles]

15:20.180 --> 15:22.791
Wait. What are you doing here?

15:22.834 --> 15:27.404
I was...I was also looking
for tech that might be
extraterrestrial.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.579
Really?

15:28.623 --> 15:29.580
Mmm-hmm.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.408
I knew you were into UFOs,

15:31.452 --> 15:34.194
but I didn't realize
you were that into UFOs.

15:36.674 --> 15:39.068
[Naomi] Have you
found anything?

15:39.112 --> 15:41.592
No. The building's empty.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.507
Like everyone left in a hurry.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.292
But there's no damage
anywhere else,

15:45.335 --> 15:48.686
so, they must have been able
to keep it under the radar.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.037
I think this was
Dr. Bell's lab,

15:52.734 --> 15:54.866
which means
that is her observation room.

16:10.621 --> 16:11.448
[Naomi] Look at this.

16:13.407 --> 16:16.540
Hard drive still seems intact.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.673
Maybe some of Dr. Bell's
research is on it.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.596
Jacob, we should
get out of here
before we get caught.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.339
[meter crackling heavily]

16:32.382 --> 16:34.906
[Jacob] Whoa. My energy meter
is going crazy.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.038
That's new.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.432
I wasn't getting
readings before.

16:38.475 --> 16:41.261
What is this thing?
The readings are off the chart.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.262
Jacob, come on.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.263
[rumbling]

16:44.220 --> 16:45.047
Jacob!

16:52.141 --> 16:55.840
That is awesome.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.238
[school bell ringing]

17:02.282 --> 17:04.110
-[locker slams shut]
-[Naomi] Jacob.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.025
-What are you doing?
-You've been
avoiding me all day.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.202
Could you sense
that I was there?

17:09.245 --> 17:10.725
Is that one of your powers?

17:10.768 --> 17:13.075
-What other powers do you have?
-[shushes]

17:13.119 --> 17:14.685
[whispering]
Keep your voice down.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.209
[whispering] This is, by far,
the greatest thing

17:16.252 --> 17:18.385
that has ever happened to me.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.387
I knew aliens were real.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.780
I can't believe
that I'm friends with one.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.391
You can't tell anyone, okay?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.567
Of course. Pfft. I'm a vault.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.571
And maybe
stop yelling "aliens!"

17:31.833 --> 17:32.703
Right.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.792
Ooh. Right.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.317
Wait. What if we had
a code word?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.580
Like, "E.T.Fan."

17:39.623 --> 17:41.234
It's the best alien movie
of all time.

17:41.277 --> 17:44.106
You're taking this
surprisingly well.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.979
I've always thought
there was life
on other planets.

17:48.023 --> 17:51.331
Have you always known
that you were an E.T.Fan?

17:52.332 --> 17:53.811
No.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.378
I found out
after the Superman thing.

17:56.988 --> 17:57.989
He's real, by the way.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.514
[both] Pfft!

18:00.557 --> 18:01.428
[laughs]

18:02.429 --> 18:03.691
Does anyone else know?

18:05.736 --> 18:06.781
Does Annabelle know?

18:07.912 --> 18:09.349
She knows.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.438
-And she didn't tell me?
-Don't be mad at her.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.179
I made her promise
not to tell anyone.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.269
You can't tell her
that you know.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.097
But we're a fellowship now.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.055
I'm trying to keep her
out of this.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.754
-You too.
-You need my expertise
to hack that hard drive.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.715
Fine. But only this once.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.412
Now, can we please
talk about this
someplace else?

18:29.456 --> 18:30.544
-It's just too much--
-[Annabelle] Talk about what?

18:31.762 --> 18:33.155
Since when do you two
hang out

18:33.199 --> 18:34.939
between second
and third period?

18:34.983 --> 18:38.029
That's sacred Naomi-Belle time.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.771
Hey, hon.
We were just talking about...

18:42.904 --> 18:43.774
Um...

18:45.341 --> 18:46.473
Lord of the Rings.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.431
Deluxe edition.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.826
You hate Lord of the Rings.

18:51.869 --> 18:54.524
-You do?
-"Hate" is a strong word.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.265
I'm gonna go to class.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.882
No. In new releases,
Detective Comics,

19:04.926 --> 19:07.058
Future Stateand The Joker
all get piled under "B."

19:07.102 --> 19:09.148
How does that make sense?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.714
Because "B" stands for Batman,
which all these books
are about.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.847
Then why don't they just
title them all Batman?

19:12.890 --> 19:14.892
Because sometimes
they're not about Batman.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.546
[both] What?

19:16.590 --> 19:17.808
Here, I'll just do it.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.288
You go through those boxes.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.334
Those are issues
I'm putting up for sale.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.640
Aren't you supposed to give us
snacks or something?

19:23.684 --> 19:25.164
No eating in the store.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.817
We've been at this for hours.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.689
Fine. I'll grab some bottles
of water in the back.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.434
So much for cakewalk.

19:34.477 --> 19:35.522
[sighs] Yeah.

19:38.829 --> 19:39.830
Check this out.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.311
Lourdes' personal stash.

19:48.970 --> 19:49.971
Whoa.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.192
[Anthony] These are incredible.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.369
These are all super old.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.980
They must be worth a ton.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.811
What are you doing?
That's private.

20:03.854 --> 20:07.118
-Uh, this was
in the "For sale" pile.
-[Lourdes tuts]

20:07.162 --> 20:10.165
Wait, you're not selling
your personal collection,
are you?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.123
I am, and it's not
a big deal, okay?

20:12.167 --> 20:13.734
Just please get back to work.

20:13.777 --> 20:14.865
Why would you do that?

20:17.520 --> 20:20.915
Because, like Nathan said,
this place is lowkey empty

20:20.958 --> 20:22.830
and this is how I keep
the store afloat, okay?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.225
I'm sorry, Lourdes. I...

20:27.226 --> 20:28.488
I didn't know.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.359
No, there's got to be
another way.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.100
We can... We can help
with more stuff
around here. We--

20:32.143 --> 20:34.276
[Lourdes] Congratulations.
Your 40 hours are done.

20:35.886 --> 20:36.757
You can leave now.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.761
Enjoy the water.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.766
Dr. Bell specialized in
dynamic acceleration

20:45.809 --> 20:47.158
as it pertains to energies.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.031
It's pretty fascinating.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.293
That's why
her scanning technology

20:51.337 --> 20:53.164
was able to sense
who I really was.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.949
Exactly.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.777
My prototype
functions more like
a magnetometer.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.169
But I don't think
that'll work here.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.347
Unless we combine them.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.914
Maybe we could model it
like an accelerometer,

21:03.958 --> 21:07.309
but we could modify it
using Dr. Bell's technology.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.050
Then, if we used a transmitter

21:09.093 --> 21:11.270
-to amplify the vibrational--
-We could attract aliens.

21:12.793 --> 21:13.663
Let's do this.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.883
[upbeat music playing]

21:48.524 --> 21:50.613
[trilling]

21:50.657 --> 21:52.223
-[laughs]
-Ha-ha! Success!

22:02.059 --> 22:04.453
-Huh.
-What's wrong?
Is it not working?

22:04.497 --> 22:05.976
I don't know.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.023
I'm getting multiple readings.
There's you.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.025
And then there are
three others.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.812
Are there other aliens
in Port Oswego?

22:15.856 --> 22:17.379
Okay, this is a story
for another day.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.600
This is the one we need.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.515
A storage unit on Hillhurst.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.604
[chuckles] Why is an alien
at a storage unit?

22:26.475 --> 22:27.520
There's only one way
to find out.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.226
We need to talk.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.359
There's nothing to talk about.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.318
You're being naive.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
You haven't been
working with her.
You don't know what she needs.

22:46.582 --> 22:47.496
And you do?

22:56.157 --> 22:57.593
Your approach could work.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.379
If we had more time.

23:04.818 --> 23:05.732
But we don't.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.432
We need to accelerate
the emergence of her powers.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.696
Two months ago,
she didn't even know
she had powers.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.438
It's too fast.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.918
She needs to be pushed.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.921
There's a fine line
between pushing her

23:20.964 --> 23:23.010
and overwhelming her.

23:23.053 --> 23:26.317
I respect you
trying to protect her.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.190
But going easy on her now
only puts her in danger later.

23:29.233 --> 23:32.933
Naomi's emotions
still control her.

23:36.806 --> 23:39.200
That's dangerous

23:39.243 --> 23:41.158
when you're dealing
with power like hers.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.422
That's exactly what we need.

23:43.465 --> 23:47.774
We need to teach her
to use her emotion
to amplify her power.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.951
[Dee] An emotional fighter
is a provoked one.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.387
You don't win fights that way.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.650
Unleashing her abilities
is the only chance

23:54.694 --> 23:56.609
that we have against Brutus.

23:56.652 --> 23:59.481
It's the best way
for Naomi to protect
the people she loves.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.007
You, of all people,
should understand that.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.193
If we push her

24:17.107 --> 24:18.152
too hard,

24:18.848 --> 24:20.589
too fast,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.504
she could lose control.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.158
And then what?

24:24.201 --> 24:28.597
What if she loses someone
she loves because of it?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.294
That would destroy her.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.603
What's happening
is bigger than that.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.826
It's worth the risk.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.088
Maybe to you.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.526
But not to me.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.573
And definitely not to Naomi.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.926
My answer is final.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.148
[Jacob] The echolocation data

24:58.192 --> 25:01.151
indicates the alien energy
is just up ahead.

25:01.195 --> 25:05.286
This place seems pretty empty.
Are you sure that it's working?

25:05.329 --> 25:08.768
Well, I mean, it's a prototype,
so, I'd expect it to be
a little glitchy.

25:08.811 --> 25:09.856
[device chimes]

25:09.899 --> 25:10.944
[Jacob] Here we are.

25:10.987 --> 25:11.814
Stand back.

25:13.729 --> 25:14.730
[lock clanks]

25:16.210 --> 25:18.168
-This will never get old.
-[shutter opens]

25:26.699 --> 25:27.961
Why did it send us here?

25:31.617 --> 25:35.403
Is it possible your device
sensed the energy of the disc?

25:35.446 --> 25:37.971
It's not really supposed
to work like that,

25:38.014 --> 25:40.887
but, then again,
this is a brave new world.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.933
Maybe it's hidden
in here somewhere.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.027
Do aliens like stuffed animals?

25:51.071 --> 25:52.463
I had a bear like that
when I was little.

25:54.378 --> 25:56.685
And a lamp like this.

25:56.729 --> 26:00.646
What are the chances
you also had a box
labeled "Naomi's Baby stuff"?

26:00.689 --> 26:03.083
Our device must have
just found you twice.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.143
Why do your parents
have a go bag?

26:25.322 --> 26:26.585
I have no idea.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.812
After enough champagne,
does anyone really
notice the decorations?

26:38.118 --> 26:39.598
-I notice.
-[chuckles]

26:39.641 --> 26:41.382
[door opens]

26:41.425 --> 26:43.297
Oh, perfect timing.
We could really use your help

26:43.340 --> 26:44.603
-hanging all these--
-What is this?

26:47.518 --> 26:49.390
And why do you have
a secret storage unit?

26:50.260 --> 26:51.653
It's not a secret, baby.

26:51.697 --> 26:54.438
Fake passports, cash.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.353
[scoffs] This is like
something out of a movie.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.619
What is going on?

27:00.662 --> 27:03.709
-Have a seat, pumpkin.
-[Naomi] No.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.145
No, thank you,
I'd like to stand.

27:08.409 --> 27:09.802
This, uh...

27:09.845 --> 27:12.021
It wasn't how
we wanted you to find out.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.153
Is this about us moving?

27:15.808 --> 27:17.331
I heard you two
talking about it.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.464
Not exactly.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.292
[Jennifer] But things
with the military
have gotten dangerous.

27:23.032 --> 27:23.903
Dangerous?

27:24.904 --> 27:27.036
They found your birth rock.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.212
And I can't be sure,
but I think Commander Steel

27:29.256 --> 27:32.172
is starting to suspect
I'm hiding something.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.565
We're not trying to scare you.
That's why we didn't
want to tell you.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.265
But we need to be prepared.

27:38.308 --> 27:39.658
[Jennifer] We've always
had the bag.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.138
Or a version of it.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.707
Ever since you were a baby.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.535
We had to assume
this day might come.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.886
All this time, you've...

27:52.409 --> 27:54.368
You've been living in fear
because of me.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.588
We love you.

27:59.329 --> 28:02.245
We will always do everything
we can to protect you.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.292
But, uh, this time,

28:07.337 --> 28:11.124
that might mean us
leaving Port Oswego.

28:13.822 --> 28:16.695
So, we'll all just be
on the run
for the rest of our life.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.351
And you're okay with that?

28:21.395 --> 28:23.179
if it means keeping you safe?

28:23.963 --> 28:25.312
Absolutely.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.623
-[shop doorbell dings]
-[dramatic music playing
over speakers]

28:35.757 --> 28:37.324
What the hell?

28:37.367 --> 28:39.021
[man] Who is Shelob's mother
and how did she die?

28:39.065 --> 28:40.980
[Nathan] Uh, I wouldn't
even know what a Shelob is.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.809
Tough Q.
Can you answer it, King?

28:43.852 --> 28:49.118
Shelob's mother is Ungoliant,
a giant primordial spider

28:49.162 --> 28:52.469
who died by devouring
herself from hunger!

28:52.513 --> 28:54.341
-Hoo.
-[clapping]

28:54.384 --> 28:55.951
[Jacob] Even Colbert
knows this.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.345
What the hell is going on?
I closed the store.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.434
Your dad let us in.
We wanted to surprise you.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.784
Lord of the Ringstrivia
at Levon's.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.526
We got T-shirts made
and everything.
It's pretty good, right?

29:05.569 --> 29:06.745
I hate Lord of the Rings.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.833
[audience] Aww.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.312
Why do people keep saying that?

29:09.356 --> 29:10.749
Are you trying
to hurt my feelings?

29:16.232 --> 29:17.494
Hi.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.670
Um, this is my store.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.761
The king is dead.
So, everyone please leave.

29:23.849 --> 29:24.675
Now!

29:25.633 --> 29:27.548
[microphone feedback]

29:27.591 --> 29:29.332
Just getting warmed up.

29:29.376 --> 29:32.074
All those orcs and elves
were about to pay
five bucks a head

29:32.118 --> 29:33.554
to try and stump Jacob.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.686
Yeah, I don't care.
This is not my vibe.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.385
No disrespect,
but your current vibe
is "going out of business."

29:38.428 --> 29:40.343
I don't care.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.216
Why would you even think
it was okay to do this
in the store?

29:43.259 --> 29:46.306
Lord of the Ringsisn't even
comic-book-related.

29:46.349 --> 29:49.309
Wait, really? What about
the cloaks and the--

29:49.352 --> 29:51.485
It doesn't matter.
You should have asked me first.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.925
We were just
trying to do something nice.

29:56.969 --> 29:59.014
We wanted to get people
in your store

29:59.058 --> 30:00.668
so you didn't have to
sell your comics.

30:00.711 --> 30:01.974
I didn't ask you to do that.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.327
I don't need your pity.

30:07.370 --> 30:10.199
We just wanted to help.
That's kind of what friends do.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.812
We're not friends.

30:13.855 --> 30:16.945
Okay? If it wasn't for Naomi,
we would barely even
know each other.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.512
Wow. Harsh.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.167
Just facts.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.864
You don't owe me anything.
I don't owe you.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.474
So, just
leave me alone, please.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.695
Get this stuff
out of the store.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.659
I had no idea
this was going to be
such intense cardio.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.576
Tried calling you last night.

30:39.620 --> 30:43.537
Oh, yeah. Um, sorry.
I had a pre-calc study session.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.495
Polynomials are no joke.

30:45.539 --> 30:48.890
Says the girl who got a 110
on her midterm.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.893
I'm sure it had nothing to do
with you being
at a storage unit

30:51.937 --> 30:52.894
with my boyfriend.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.418
Jacob told you?

30:55.462 --> 30:57.203
He has a terrible poker face.

30:57.246 --> 30:58.595
He held out longer
than I thought.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.947
Naomi, what's going on?

31:03.165 --> 31:05.080
I was trying to keep you safe

31:05.124 --> 31:06.777
By lying to me?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.040
Things have changed.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.868
Everything that happened
at STAR Labs

31:09.911 --> 31:11.739
and with the military,
it's all getting
really dangerous.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.525
You should have
told me the truth.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.311
If I had, you would have
found a way to get involved.

31:18.354 --> 31:21.749
Yes, because I'm
your best friend.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.142
That's the point.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.275
My birth parents died
because of me.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.755
Zumbado's life was ruined.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.322
My parents,
they've been living in fear.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.585
All this bad stuff
has happened because of me.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.024
And now people
are coming after me.

31:36.068 --> 31:39.158
That's why you need help.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.769
Moving around all the time,
I had a lot of friends,

31:41.812 --> 31:46.252
but I never had a best friend
until I met you.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.083
If something were
to happen to you
because of me,

31:51.126 --> 31:52.649
I'd never forgive myself.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.917
I get that you're scared,

31:58.960 --> 32:01.745
but you and me
are the OG members
of this alien ride.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.793
You should have given me
the chance to get off

32:05.836 --> 32:07.490
instead of making
that call for me,

32:19.502 --> 32:21.156
What are we doing here?

32:21.200 --> 32:23.942
We need to work
some things out.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.813
If this is about
Naomi's training,

32:25.856 --> 32:28.598
I told you, I'm done talking.

32:29.686 --> 32:30.905
So am I.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.266
Fight me.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.834
You can't be serious.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.750
No wings.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.187
No powers.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.625
Just hand to hand, you and me.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.717
This is not productive.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.024
You say that your style
of training Naomi is better.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.461
So, prove it.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.116
If I win,

33:09.030 --> 33:10.336
our debate ends.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.427
We do things my way.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.129
[both grunt, groan]

33:26.830 --> 33:27.744
[Zumbado] Aargh!

33:29.050 --> 33:30.269
[Dee] Ah!

33:32.314 --> 33:33.750
[Zumbado yells]

33:35.665 --> 33:37.102
[Dee] Enough?

33:37.145 --> 33:38.364
[Zumbado breathing heavily]

33:39.930 --> 33:41.193
No.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.678
[object clattering]

33:55.990 --> 33:57.861
[Dee groaning]

33:59.515 --> 34:00.473
[groans loudly]

34:04.129 --> 34:07.871
[breathing heavily]
We had rules of engagement.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.047
Until we didn't.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.359
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

34:18.839 --> 34:22.103
There is no honor
with Naomi's enemies.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.627
No rules, no code.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.325
I know that.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.588
Then why are you training her
like you don't?

34:37.684 --> 34:39.077
["Laisse moi t'aimer" playing]

34:42.428 --> 34:43.385
Nice to see you.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.822
Hey.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.520
Your parents know
how to throw a party.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.479
These snacks are on point.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.655
Murray's finest. [chuckles]

34:52.699 --> 34:54.092
Any luck with the disc?

34:54.135 --> 34:56.572
Oh! I calibrated
the accelerometer

34:56.616 --> 34:59.140
to adjust for
mechanoreceptor vibrations.

34:59.184 --> 35:02.578
So, this time, it will track
a person, not an object.

35:02.622 --> 35:03.840
Theoretically.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.799
I'll have to test it out first.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.714
-I need my laptop.
-Okay.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.237
And quiet.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.543
You can use my bedroom.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.635
Have I ever told you
my favorite scene
from Lord of the Rings?

35:17.158 --> 35:19.769
Weirdly, I don't think
you have.

35:19.813 --> 35:23.512
At the end of the first book,
Frodo has realized
that the only way

35:23.556 --> 35:26.341
to keep the fellowship safe
is to leave.

35:26.385 --> 35:30.128
So, he tries to sneak away.
Except, Sam won't let him.

35:30.171 --> 35:33.566
Sam says that there's no way
he's letting Frodo go alone.

35:36.308 --> 35:37.787
Sam was with him to the end.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.181
That's where he wanted to be.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.834
[reading]
"Jacob's trivia winnings.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.185
We figured you should have it.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.274
Maybe it can buy
one of your comics.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.711
Nathan and Anthony."

36:49.772 --> 36:51.296
[Zumbado] You said
you wanted to talk.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.995
-You ever work one of these?
-No.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.389
The key to going fast...

37:00.087 --> 37:01.697
isn't about hitting harder.

37:02.611 --> 37:03.525
Too big...

37:06.093 --> 37:07.225
and you break your rhythm.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.664
In a way, going fast
requires you to...

37:19.324 --> 37:20.847
hold back.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.676
[Zumbado] I assume
this is a metaphor.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.895
[Dee] I know the danger
Naomi's facing.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.288
I want her to be ready.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.725
I was just hoping
she'd have more time.

37:29.769 --> 37:30.900
I understand.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.251
But we're past that.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.998
It can't just be your way

37:42.042 --> 37:43.609
and it can't just be mine.

37:43.652 --> 37:47.917
As powerful as Naomi is,
she's still just a teenager.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.745
Her emotions have an impact,

37:51.181 --> 37:52.444
good or bad.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.360
You're right.

37:55.403 --> 37:58.450
Keeping her in balance
requires keeping each other
in balance.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.973
If we're gonna protect her,

38:01.670 --> 38:03.629
takes the best parts
of both of us.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.284
Finally,

38:07.850 --> 38:09.417
something we agree on.

38:12.333 --> 38:16.294
So, apparently, "comic book"
isn't a genre,

38:16.337 --> 38:17.425
it's a medium.

38:19.035 --> 38:22.038
So, Lord of the Rings
is comic-book-related?

38:24.040 --> 38:26.521
We need to talk.

38:26.565 --> 38:29.002
-Are you gonna
yell at us again?
-I didn't yell.

38:30.438 --> 38:34.137
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm just not used to this.

38:35.530 --> 38:36.836
Used to what?

38:36.879 --> 38:39.055
Having friends or whatever.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.319
Aah, so, we are friends.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.499
Yeah, we're sorry, too.

38:47.542 --> 38:51.720
We should have asked you
before doing anything
at of your store.

38:51.764 --> 38:55.463
We have more ideas,
by the way,
better than Stump the King.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.378
Good, because I hate
that movie.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.337
I'm starting
to really get that.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.295
[all laugh]

39:01.339 --> 39:02.514
[glasses clink]

39:05.430 --> 39:07.823
Are you guys hiding
at your own party?

39:07.867 --> 39:13.046
-What? No.
-We were just
taking a breather.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.656
You guys are lowkey hiding.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.484
[Jen and Greg chuckle]

39:18.138 --> 39:20.183
Happy anniversary,
Mr. and Mrs. M!

39:20.227 --> 39:22.925
Cake emergency
has been averted.
Where do you want this?

39:27.365 --> 39:28.322
[Naomi] I'll take it.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.981
You know what?
I think Naomi was right.

39:35.024 --> 39:36.069
We should mingle.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.384
I didn't think you'd come.

39:47.646 --> 39:48.603
What are you talking about?

39:50.300 --> 39:51.737
I thought we were in a fight.

39:51.780 --> 39:56.176
We were in a fight
and it was very dramatic,

39:56.219 --> 39:58.178
but that's what people do.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.222
They fight sometimes.

40:01.311 --> 40:04.010
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

40:04.053 --> 40:06.882
For trying to keep you out,
for trying to not tell you
the truth.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.496
You were right.
This is your choice.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.934
I'm not sure I can
do this without you.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.460
You don't have to.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.722
Ride or ride, remember?

40:23.203 --> 40:25.335
[cell phone notification
chimes]

40:26.728 --> 40:29.427
Jacob just sent us a 9-1-1.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.645
From upstairs?

40:39.132 --> 40:40.002
[car door shuts]

40:44.877 --> 40:46.139
[indistinct radio chatter]

40:52.493 --> 40:53.625
[woman] How much
do we take, sir?

40:56.366 --> 40:57.193
All of it.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.507
Jacob, what's wrong?

41:06.551 --> 41:10.076
Okay, so, you know how I said
that fine-tuning
the mechanoreceptor settings

41:10.119 --> 41:11.512
might detect energy?

41:11.556 --> 41:12.557
[Naomi] Mmm-hmm.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.124
I was right. It worked.

41:15.168 --> 41:18.432
I thought that was supposed
to be a good thing.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.088
I was able to pinpoint
the extraterrestrial activity.

41:22.131 --> 41:23.742
Jacob, what are you saying?

41:23.785 --> 41:26.614
The alien
we're looking for is here.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.356
At the party.

41:38.321 --> 41:39.453
