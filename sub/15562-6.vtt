WEBVTT

00:00.398 --> 00:02.085
Today is a high-alert day.

00:02.164 --> 00:05.082
I can't stress enough the importance
of being vigilant and cautious

00:05.090 --> 00:08.326
in light of the serious
threats we'll be facing.

00:08.352 --> 00:09.050
Dina's right.

00:09.051 --> 00:13.174
So everybody keep an eye out for
anything out of the ordinary.

00:13.208 --> 00:14.642
Okay? Good.

00:14.676 --> 00:17.311
Let's watch out for people
buying toilet paper, eggs,

00:17.346 --> 00:18.713
shaving cream, ketchup,

00:18.781 --> 00:20.481
your squeezables, your squirtables...

00:20.516 --> 00:22.550
everything is a weapon today, okay?

00:22.618 --> 00:24.719
- What about guns?
- Those are fine.

00:24.787 --> 00:27.055
Incidentally,
that costume is ridiculous.

00:27.122 --> 00:28.623
Professor X doesn't drink martinis.

00:28.657 --> 00:31.196
Yes, but James Bond does.

00:31.197 --> 00:31.673
Ugh.

00:31.882 --> 00:33.352
Oh, come on, Dina.

00:33.382 --> 00:36.183
Stop being the Halloween version
of Scrooge, whatever that is.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.303
Oh, Booge!

00:38.337 --> 00:40.372
Boo, Scrooge. I just thought of that.

00:40.406 --> 00:41.506
Yeah, don't be such a Booge.

00:41.540 --> 00:42.486
Put on a costume.

00:42.494 --> 00:45.496
Yeah, don't be a Booge!

00:45.524 --> 00:48.125
Ooh, peer pressure from a group
of people I don't respect.

00:48.159 --> 00:49.793
Now, that's scary.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.604
I mean, I can't believe I'm saying this,

00:51.605 --> 00:53.539
but Sandra's the only
other grown-up here.

00:53.606 --> 00:56.542
Actually, I am dressed up. I'm you.

00:58.318 --> 01:00.152
- What?
- "Shut up, Sandra."

01:00.193 --> 01:01.513
Shut up, Sandra!

01:01.514 --> 01:02.777
Oh, my God, that's so cool.

01:02.778 --> 01:04.779
- You're gonna be twinsies.
- No, we're not.

01:04.846 --> 01:07.014
Wait, you guys
should stand together all day.

01:07.048 --> 01:07.803
I'm up for it.

01:07.804 --> 01:10.404
Yeah, I'm gonna find
a costume to put on.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.807
Booge.

01:15.411 --> 01:17.679
So let's keep an eye out
for teens, tweens,

01:17.747 --> 01:20.682
people who look inappropriately
large or small...

01:21.818 --> 01:23.778
Are you guys even listening to me?

01:25.355 --> 01:26.455
Hello?

01:26.489 --> 01:27.989
Nothing.

01:28.024 --> 01:29.004
Yep, got it.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.580
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:38.897 --> 01:42.015
It's a... interesting costume.

01:42.050 --> 01:45.385
Yeah, you know, what's crazy
are those... the boots.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.888
Boots. Yes, definitely the boots.

01:48.262 --> 01:51.431
I cannot stop staring
at her giant breasts.

01:51.943 --> 01:53.509
You know, now that you say it...

01:53.509 --> 01:54.514
There is a lot of dÃ©colletage, yes.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.449
I'm seeing it.

01:55.517 --> 01:57.050
You guys, relax.

01:57.086 --> 01:59.187
We all think she looks hot, okay?

01:59.221 --> 02:00.889
No, not me.

02:00.923 --> 02:03.725
I mean, maybe with another
personality in that body, sure,

02:03.759 --> 02:06.961
ta-dow, but you got to factor in
the Dina that lies beneath.

02:07.029 --> 02:08.797
Not so fast.

02:08.864 --> 02:12.400
I want to know exactly what you're
planning to do with this toilet paper.

02:12.434 --> 02:14.469
Uh, I'll take extra bacon, extra cheese,

02:14.537 --> 02:16.404
and if you can, make it extra quick,

02:16.438 --> 02:19.073
'cause this outlaw
needs to get his grub on.

02:19.108 --> 02:20.622
- Boo!
- Jeff.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.123
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

02:22.158 --> 02:24.426
Oh, uh, there was a stabbing
at the Kirkwood store.

02:24.452 --> 02:27.221
Well, that's boring, but, you know,

02:28.125 --> 02:31.165
I'm in town till tomorrow, so,
you know, I'm free tonight if...

02:31.166 --> 02:32.366
I know it's last-minute, but...

02:32.434 --> 02:34.835
Please, last-minute is fine.

02:34.869 --> 02:36.252
It's not like I'm one of
those people who can't

02:36.253 --> 02:37.816
go on a date unless he,
you know, works out

02:37.851 --> 02:40.352
and waxes and plucks and bleaches...

02:40.387 --> 02:41.887
got to plan at least
two or three outfits.

02:41.956 --> 02:44.824
Good. All right, well, then
I'll pick you up after work.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.025
- That sounds great.
- Right?

02:46.060 --> 02:48.027
- Jeff?
- Hey.

02:48.391 --> 02:50.663
- Hey.
- To what do we owe this honor?

02:51.034 --> 02:53.335
Oh, um, well, I just came...

02:53.369 --> 02:55.304
Oh, right, the Kirkwood stabbing.

02:55.338 --> 02:57.912
I heard about that. That poor nun.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.247
Not actually a real nun, by the way...

03:00.289 --> 03:01.144
just a woman in a costume.

03:01.145 --> 03:03.576
But still, stabbed
right in the face... oh.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.683
- Yeah.
- Terrible Halloween.

03:05.718 --> 03:08.686
Hey, did you see? I'm a hot dog.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.522
- I did.
- Yeah.

03:19.694 --> 03:22.395
Happy Halloween! Bye!

03:22.430 --> 03:24.597
I love how into Halloween you are.

03:24.632 --> 03:26.566
Oh, my God, it's
my favorite day of the year.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.991
And later, I get to go trick-or-treating
with Emma, which is the best.

03:30.014 --> 03:30.499
Hmm.

03:30.499 --> 03:32.700
Oh, and it doesn't get
any cuter than this.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.002
Left and right and whoo-whoo!

03:35.037 --> 03:37.004
Come on, keep doing the candy dance.

03:37.039 --> 03:39.006
Left and right and...

03:39.041 --> 03:40.975
Oh, look, it's working!

03:41.009 --> 03:43.844
It's working! Way to go!

03:43.879 --> 03:45.880
Ma'am, you realize
that candy from strangers

03:45.914 --> 03:48.015
can contain razor blades
and heroin needles, right?

03:48.050 --> 03:49.584
I'm sorry?

03:49.651 --> 03:51.686
Dina, again,

03:51.720 --> 03:54.188
I did not put heroin needles
in the candy.

03:54.222 --> 03:55.321
I'm not saying you did.

03:55.321 --> 03:57.561
I'm just saying, best-case
scenario: Free chocolate bar.

03:57.577 --> 03:59.077
Worst-case scenario: "Trainspotting."

03:59.113 --> 04:01.781
Okay. Thanks anyway.

04:02.750 --> 04:03.803
That's what I thought.

04:03.804 --> 04:05.970
You have to stop
harassing the customers.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.874
I will not apologize for my
commitment to our customers' safety.

04:09.908 --> 04:13.311
- Dina, don't make me have to...
- What?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.446
What would you do if you were me?

04:15.480 --> 04:16.480
Oh, Glenn, if I was you,

04:16.548 --> 04:17.815
I would've killed myself years ago.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.450
- Okay.
- Dina?

04:19.483 --> 04:22.320
You know, I think I saw
some really sketchy types

04:22.387 --> 04:23.788
headed for the stockroom.

04:23.822 --> 04:24.955
Sounds suspicious.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.757
Yeah, they were...
they were carrying, uh,

04:26.792 --> 04:28.926
toilet paper and shaving cream.

04:28.960 --> 04:29.693
What?

04:29.693 --> 04:32.328
Those are exactly the things
I said to look out for.

04:32.363 --> 04:34.397
It's like I just talk to myself
in this store.

04:35.699 --> 04:37.333
Thanks, Amy.

04:37.368 --> 04:39.636
I was really gonna let her have it.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.338
Has anyone noticed anything
out of the ordinary back here?

04:42.373 --> 04:44.240
Well, it's Halloween, so everything's

04:44.308 --> 04:45.642
kind of out of the ordinary.

04:45.676 --> 04:48.378
Get out of my way, Janay.

04:48.412 --> 04:50.046
It's Janet.

04:51.215 --> 04:52.682
Why is this unlocked?

04:52.716 --> 04:55.518
Janay, who unlocked this?

05:03.430 --> 05:04.764
Funny, I've never been, uh...

05:04.797 --> 05:06.832
never been assigned here before.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.167
Hmm.

05:08.235 --> 05:09.569
Jewelry's a real can of worms

05:09.602 --> 05:11.403
in terms of feminism, you know?

05:13.273 --> 05:14.440
Uh-huh.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.110
This is great.

05:18.144 --> 05:19.477
This is great, us working together.

05:19.512 --> 05:21.780
I feel like we never really
had the chance to... to...

05:21.814 --> 05:24.054
to bond, really.

05:24.054 --> 05:25.855
Yeah, totally.

05:32.963 --> 05:35.131
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers,

05:35.164 --> 05:37.478
I vant to suck your blood

05:37.478 --> 05:39.312
and test it for diabetes.

05:39.347 --> 05:41.981
At-home insulin kits are now half off.

05:42.016 --> 05:44.517
Are you looking
for spook-tacular savings?

05:44.585 --> 05:46.953
Because Cloud 9 has it all.

05:46.987 --> 05:49.689
You can get, um, the...

05:52.760 --> 05:54.994
Uh...

05:55.029 --> 05:57.597
Attention, shoppers,
I vant to suck your blood.

05:57.631 --> 05:58.381
Oh, I did that one.

05:58.382 --> 06:00.515
- Oh.
- Everybody freeze!

06:00.549 --> 06:03.385
There's been an employee theft
in the store.

06:03.419 --> 06:06.254
Nobody can leave. I repeat, no one.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.525
Well, sorry, I-I actually
just meant the employees.

06:10.559 --> 06:12.594
Customers can leave.

06:12.662 --> 06:15.997
So... unfreeze.

06:20.169 --> 06:21.269
You okay? You look sick.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.405
Sick? Yeah, I'm sick.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.621
At 8:24, a crate of irregular
produce was put in the cage

06:30.622 --> 06:32.356
to be returned to fulfillment
and destroyed.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.625
Now it's missing.

06:33.658 --> 06:36.594
I'm sorry. Irregular produce?
You mean rotten?

06:36.629 --> 06:39.331
No, what I'm talking about is
lumps, bumps, extra appendages,

06:39.364 --> 06:42.001
apples that look like pears,
pears that look like guavas.

06:42.002 --> 06:45.469
So we're just throwing away perfectly
good food because it's ugly?

06:45.504 --> 06:47.205
Looks matter, Jonah.

06:47.272 --> 06:50.441
You should know that, being
the prettiest person in here.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.644
I will be interrogating
each and every one of you.

06:52.677 --> 06:55.045
No one leaves until I find out
who did it.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.047
- Ugh, come on.
- No.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.215
- No!
- What?

06:57.283 --> 06:58.516
No, you can't just keep us here.

06:58.550 --> 06:59.969
I'm going trick-or-treating
with my daughter.

06:59.970 --> 07:02.415
Yeah, I have a date...
uh, with a good book.

07:02.447 --> 07:05.874
I'm going to a screening of "Nosferatu"
at the Tivoli, if anybody wants to come.

07:05.942 --> 07:08.310
Wow, that sounds really terrible.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.811
Okay, listen, none of this
is my problem.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.147
Justice does not stop for your plans.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.016
Glenn, you're not gonna
let her do this to us, right?

07:14.050 --> 07:15.183
Absolutely not.

07:15.218 --> 07:17.019
Interrogations start immediately.

07:17.053 --> 07:19.655
Well, if it's already starting...

07:19.689 --> 07:21.023
Man.

07:29.826 --> 07:32.160
So, Amy Dubanowski.

07:32.195 --> 07:36.865
Perfect, perfect, perfect,
perfect Amy Dubanowski.

07:36.899 --> 07:38.567
Why would I steal a crate of fruit?

07:38.601 --> 07:39.234
I don't know.

07:39.235 --> 07:41.686
I mean, clearly you've been
having trouble making ends meet,

07:41.803 --> 07:43.333
neglecting your personal hygiene,

07:43.333 --> 07:45.267
the old clothes, busted-up shoes,

07:45.302 --> 07:47.169
the ratty hair, hints of meth mouth.

07:47.237 --> 07:48.304
Okay, I'm leaving.

07:48.338 --> 07:49.638
Uh-uh, you're not going anywhere

07:49.673 --> 07:51.407
until you answer all of my questions.

07:53.343 --> 07:54.926
- Did you take the fruit?
- No.

07:54.926 --> 07:57.361
Then you can go.

07:57.428 --> 07:58.494
By the way...

07:58.530 --> 07:59.496
What?

07:59.531 --> 08:01.432
That headpiece looks great on you.

08:01.466 --> 08:04.868
Oh. Thank you.

08:04.936 --> 08:08.539
Topics, topics, topics...

08:08.605 --> 08:11.974
Oh, uh, who do you think
stole the produce?

08:12.010 --> 08:15.045
I was thinking, okay, maybe Marcus.

08:15.112 --> 08:18.147
He's been to prison before
for public peeing.

08:18.183 --> 08:20.017
Really?

08:20.050 --> 08:23.853
Well, I was thinking Mary,

08:23.887 --> 08:26.889
because I heard
that she's drinking again.

08:26.958 --> 08:28.025
No.

08:28.059 --> 08:30.527
Mm-hmm.

08:30.562 --> 08:32.328
Alcohol?

08:32.363 --> 08:34.131
I think so, yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:44.075 --> 08:46.009
It's the... it's the bun.

08:48.313 --> 08:50.229
I can't help but notice
that you're sweating.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.097
Got any secrets you'd like to share?

08:53.132 --> 08:53.715
No.

08:53.716 --> 08:55.648
You know, some thieves have a tell...

08:55.681 --> 08:57.616
like talking with your hand
over your mouth.

08:57.651 --> 08:58.851
Oh.

08:58.852 --> 09:00.286
Okay.

09:00.287 --> 09:02.655
You don't have the courage
or the intelligence

09:02.689 --> 09:03.956
to have stolen anything.

09:03.991 --> 09:05.658
Then why are you even talking to me?

09:05.692 --> 09:07.393
I just wanted you to know that.

09:07.461 --> 09:09.328
Did I steal the fruit? No.

09:09.363 --> 09:11.664
Was it an act of civil
disobedience that I admire?

09:11.698 --> 09:12.698
Yes.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.500
Do I know who stole it?

09:14.535 --> 09:15.501
No.

09:15.536 --> 09:17.503
Stop interrogating yourself.

09:17.538 --> 09:19.906
Maybe you put the fruit
somewhere and forgot.

09:19.973 --> 09:22.508
One time, I texted Bo
that I couldn't find my phone,

09:22.543 --> 09:25.244
and then he's like "Hey, dummy,
what are you texting me on?"

09:25.312 --> 09:29.649
And I'm like "Oh, yeah, right.
Goofy face emoji."

09:32.898 --> 09:33.865
What was that?

09:33.899 --> 09:35.500
Do I like fruit? Yes.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.201
What's my favorite fruit? Tropical.

09:38.236 --> 09:39.536
Be more specific.

09:39.570 --> 09:41.505
Mango.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.508
There's something about you
I just don't trust.

09:46.612 --> 09:49.547
Okay. Let's do this.

09:49.581 --> 09:51.549
- Did you steal the fruit?
- No.

09:51.583 --> 09:52.550
You can go.

09:53.937 --> 09:55.338
What if she doesn't find out who did it?

09:55.405 --> 09:57.306
Can she just keep us here all night?

09:57.341 --> 09:58.141
No!

09:58.141 --> 10:00.474
I have to be home in an hour
to trick-or-treat with Emma.

10:04.780 --> 10:08.983
Will all employees
please meet me in the warehouse

10:09.051 --> 10:10.818
for a secret meeting?

10:10.886 --> 10:13.554
Don't tell Dina.

10:13.588 --> 10:14.822
Secret meeting.

10:14.891 --> 10:16.758
Smart.

10:16.793 --> 10:18.727
We all have plans tonight, right?

10:18.761 --> 10:19.928
- Yeah.
- Why you looking at me?

10:19.961 --> 10:22.797
I don't have any plans. Why...

10:22.832 --> 10:27.457
Okay, well, plans or no plans, whoever
took the fruit should just give it back,

10:27.457 --> 10:29.591
and we'll just tell Dina
that it was misplaced.

10:29.633 --> 10:30.667
- Okay?
- Yes.

10:30.728 --> 10:31.661
- Yeah?
- Okay.

10:31.729 --> 10:32.560
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

10:32.561 --> 10:33.562
Great.

10:33.595 --> 10:35.329
So who took it?

10:37.633 --> 10:39.234
Come on, guys.

10:39.268 --> 10:40.435
No one's perfect.

10:40.469 --> 10:43.271
I used to shoplift from the mall
all the time.

10:43.306 --> 10:45.440
Mostly black lipstick.
I was going through a phase.

10:45.474 --> 10:48.109
But we all do things we regret. So...

10:48.144 --> 10:50.312
I'm not even a member
of the Sierra Club.

10:50.346 --> 10:51.758
I just put the sticker on my bumper.

10:51.759 --> 10:52.857
I don't pay taxes.

10:52.892 --> 10:54.359
I catfished my school nurse,

10:54.393 --> 10:56.161
and she ended up moving to Australia

10:56.195 --> 10:57.896
to meet a picture of Michael Fassbender

10:57.930 --> 10:59.118
when he was young.

10:59.118 --> 11:02.487
Okay, does anybody want
to confess to taking the fruit?

11:04.891 --> 11:07.159
I have some questions
about what Cheyenne said.

11:07.226 --> 11:09.928
Fine. Forget it.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.097
She works at a smoothie stand
on the beach now.

11:12.131 --> 11:14.066
- Hmm.
- I think she's happy.

11:21.808 --> 11:24.509
Hey, man, if Dina asks
where I am, cover for me.

11:24.577 --> 11:26.011
Why? What's going on?

11:26.079 --> 11:29.014
Between us, I can't be
around Dina in that costume.

11:29.082 --> 11:30.787
It's like, my rational brain says

11:30.788 --> 11:32.020
that's the same crazy fascist

11:32.087 --> 11:33.922
that physically removed gum
from my mouth,

11:33.956 --> 11:37.659
but my caveman brain
says, "Hey, man, boobs."

11:37.693 --> 11:39.527
It's very confusing.

11:39.595 --> 11:43.431
You could just not look at her...

11:43.465 --> 11:46.483
Have you seen my eye line?
It's unavoidable.

11:46.483 --> 11:48.851
- Fair enough.
- Just keep it on the DL.

11:48.919 --> 11:52.322
- All right, I got you, son.
- Oh, God, don't say that.

11:54.925 --> 11:58.403
Guess who has a crush on Dina.

11:58.434 --> 11:59.754
You?

11:59.996 --> 12:01.328
I called around to other stores.

12:01.328 --> 12:03.562
Obviously, Kirkwood's a no-go
with the whole stabbing thing.

12:03.630 --> 12:05.998
But Chesterfield doesn't go through
their produce till Friday.

12:06.033 --> 12:09.580
We'll get their uglies. Good idea.

12:09.580 --> 12:10.947
Hang on.

12:11.014 --> 12:12.415
Oh.

12:15.162 --> 12:16.663
Uh, I can't reach my wallet.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.899
There's a slit between the meat
and the bun,

12:18.899 --> 12:20.643
if you could just snake your hand in.

12:20.643 --> 12:23.245
- Um, I'll buy it.
- Okay, thanks.

12:23.312 --> 12:26.248
The only problem is that Dina
put a guard at the door.

12:26.315 --> 12:27.916
What?

12:29.540 --> 12:30.640
What do we do?

12:30.709 --> 12:33.277
We need to come up
with some kind of plan.

12:35.279 --> 12:39.249
Oh!

12:46.458 --> 12:47.192
Whoa.

12:48.090 --> 12:51.162
This place is lame on a stick.

12:51.196 --> 12:52.663
Really? I don't think
it looks that different.

12:52.698 --> 12:53.664
Seriously?

12:53.699 --> 12:54.665
They've got bedding

12:54.700 --> 12:56.367
where the jewelry's supposed to be.

12:56.435 --> 12:58.469
It's like, what?

12:58.504 --> 13:00.505
Okay. Produce, produce, produce.

13:00.539 --> 13:03.374
- It should be aisle ten.
- Okay.

13:05.511 --> 13:07.545
What?

13:07.613 --> 13:09.313
Look how dim it is.

13:09.348 --> 13:11.682
What is this, a nightclub?

13:13.285 --> 13:14.719
Whoa.

13:14.787 --> 13:17.321
This is wildly inappropriate.

13:17.356 --> 13:19.483
Well, you've been acting weird
and avoiding me all day.

13:19.483 --> 13:21.284
No, I haven't.

13:21.317 --> 13:23.904
I've just been keeping my head down,

13:24.076 --> 13:25.987
keeping my mind on work, you know.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.987
Wow, so guilty, you can't even
look at me, can you?

13:28.988 --> 13:30.387
I'm looking right at you.

13:30.421 --> 13:33.156
Excuse me, we're having
a private conversation.

13:33.223 --> 13:34.957
Thank you.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.161
Ugly. Ugly.

13:38.229 --> 13:39.396
Wait, wait.

13:39.429 --> 13:41.738
This one looks like Matthew McConaughey.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.740
"All right, all right, all right."

13:44.776 --> 13:47.945
That's really good, Mateo,
but we need to focus.

13:47.978 --> 13:49.145
Ooh.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.817
You know what? This one's all nasty.

13:54.886 --> 13:57.254
How about you take one
of the nicer-looking grapefruit?

13:57.288 --> 13:58.956
- Oh, I don't care how it looks.
- Good.

13:58.989 --> 14:00.489
Well, then if you don't care
what it looks like,

14:00.557 --> 14:01.757
you can just take one of these.

14:01.793 --> 14:03.794
- I want this one.
- Why?

14:03.828 --> 14:06.129
Because I want it, and I need it.

14:06.164 --> 14:07.965
- No, you don't need this one.
- Yes, I do.

14:07.999 --> 14:09.833
- Okay, just give it to me.
- I had it first.

14:09.901 --> 14:11.969
Just give her the ugly
[Bleep] grapefruit!

14:17.608 --> 14:19.492
Sorry.

14:19.493 --> 14:21.728
I just want you to be able to go
trick-or-treating with your son.

14:21.763 --> 14:23.764
- Daughter.
- Whatever.

14:28.878 --> 14:30.578
That's narrow.

14:32.301 --> 14:33.635
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

14:33.669 --> 14:35.303
Where are your bathrooms?

14:35.337 --> 14:37.205
Just back and to the right.

14:38.271 --> 14:39.674
You're joking, right?

14:39.675 --> 14:40.940
I-I don't believe so.

14:40.975 --> 14:43.309
I'm amazed you guys stay open, honestly.

14:43.344 --> 14:44.304
Hey, Bobby.

14:44.305 --> 14:45.605
I finished marking down
the clearance items.

14:45.639 --> 14:46.444
Great!

14:46.445 --> 14:47.780
Why don't you work
on the shrink reports?

14:47.849 --> 14:51.084
- Will do, boss.
- All right.

14:51.445 --> 14:54.478
Wait, is that your assistant manager?

14:54.479 --> 14:56.857
Oh, yeah, Kelly. She's the best.

14:56.891 --> 14:59.559
She was so nice to you.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.294
She's nice...

15:01.362 --> 15:02.729
to me, yeah.

15:07.435 --> 15:09.236
Oh, just to the right there.

15:10.638 --> 15:12.772
Sir? Yeah.

15:12.807 --> 15:15.575
There you go. You got it now.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.445
And Susie went to Mexico
for liposuction,

15:18.479 --> 15:19.779
but something happened,

15:19.814 --> 15:21.615
and now she has a bunch
of bugs in her butt.

15:21.649 --> 15:25.719
Wow, I'm really rooting
for that story to be true.

15:25.753 --> 15:28.605
Hey, uh, what do people say about me?

15:28.606 --> 15:30.173
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on, come on.

15:30.207 --> 15:31.374
I'm sure you've heard something.

15:31.442 --> 15:33.176
It's fine. It's fine. I can...
thick skin.

15:35.112 --> 15:37.480
Okay, well...

15:37.505 --> 15:39.342
some people think that you wear a wig,

15:39.342 --> 15:42.011
and some people think
that you have a crush on Amy,

15:42.044 --> 15:45.756
and some people think that you're
a Sea Org, whatever that is.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.190
Wait, people think
I have a crush on Amy?

15:48.190 --> 15:50.841
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

15:51.639 --> 15:53.674
She's married. That's...

15:53.896 --> 15:55.297
I mean, not that you can't have a crush

15:55.331 --> 15:56.798
on someone who's married,

15:56.832 --> 15:58.229
but I mean, you know, yuck.

15:58.229 --> 15:59.630
You know, not yuck.
I think she's pretty.

15:59.663 --> 16:01.297
But she's not, like, pretty-pretty.

16:01.331 --> 16:03.332
I mean, she's... I don't know.
That's insane.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.235
Who's saying... like, who
specifically... who's saying that?

16:06.271 --> 16:08.338
Just people. Like, everyone.

16:11.809 --> 16:14.177
Kelly will do, like,
anything Bobby asks.

16:14.244 --> 16:16.345
You know, Bobby will be like,
"Hey, Kelly, do this,"

16:16.413 --> 16:18.915
and Kelly will be like,
"With pleasure, Bobby."

16:18.949 --> 16:21.289
And then Bobby will be like,
"Thanks, Kelly."

16:21.289 --> 16:23.357
Glenn, I don't know who either
of those people are.

16:23.390 --> 16:26.392
Oh.

16:28.129 --> 16:29.761
- Hey!
- Hi, Mom.

16:29.762 --> 16:31.330
Hi, baby, I know I'm running late,

16:31.364 --> 16:33.999
but I promise you I'm not gonna
miss trick-or-treating.

16:34.033 --> 16:37.202
Actually, is it okay if I go
to Finley's house instead?

16:37.236 --> 16:39.905
- Dad said he'd drop me off.
- Oh.

16:39.939 --> 16:43.275
Um, I... Yeah, yeah.

16:43.343 --> 16:45.077
I mean, if you want.

16:45.111 --> 16:47.079
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:47.113 --> 16:50.313
Yes, yes, of course. It's cool.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.147
That just means more candy for me.

16:52.181 --> 16:54.549
Num, num, num, num, num, num.

16:54.584 --> 16:57.219
Oh, sweetie. Hang up.

16:57.253 --> 16:59.188
- Thanks, Mom!
- Yeah.

16:59.222 --> 17:00.389
Bye, Emma!

17:00.422 --> 17:03.357
It's Glenn. I'm a hot dog.

17:04.727 --> 17:05.861
Okay.

17:07.222 --> 17:09.690
Garrett, Garrett, Garrett, Garrett

17:09.724 --> 17:11.659
Garrett, Garrett... Garrett.

17:13.846 --> 17:15.480
What are you thinking about right now?

17:15.515 --> 17:17.327
Hmm? Fruit, maybe?

17:17.328 --> 17:19.162
What kind of fruit... tart little kiwis?

17:19.196 --> 17:21.598
No, I bet you like big,
juicy melons, don't you?

17:21.665 --> 17:23.098
Come on, you know
what you're doing here.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.068
Yeah, I do. Catching a thief.

17:26.369 --> 17:27.521
Now, listen.

17:29.574 --> 17:32.442
Just admit what you did,
and we can end this right now.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.344
All right, fine, okay? I took the fruit.

17:34.378 --> 17:37.047
Whatever it takes.
Just get me out of here.

17:37.081 --> 17:39.382
See?

17:39.417 --> 17:40.717
Doesn't that feel better?

17:40.751 --> 17:43.119
I'm having the weirdest day.

17:47.358 --> 17:51.127
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.696
What happened to your costume?

17:52.730 --> 17:56.967
I just didn't feel
like wearing it anymore.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.136
Emma wants to hang out with her
friends tonight instead of me.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.706
Oh, that's a bummer.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.407
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

18:04.442 --> 18:07.644
But it's, you know...
it's normal, right?

18:07.712 --> 18:09.579
Yeah, I guess. It's...

18:09.614 --> 18:11.481
Yes, yes, it's normal.

18:11.549 --> 18:15.652
It's just, I just thought
I had, like, one

18:15.720 --> 18:18.088
or maybe two more years with her.

18:18.122 --> 18:20.056
- Yeah.
- You know, it's weird.

18:20.091 --> 18:23.493
It's like, you bring home
this cute little baby,

18:23.561 --> 18:25.495
and all they want is to be with you,

18:25.563 --> 18:27.264
like, every second of every day,

18:27.298 --> 18:29.132
and then they grow up,

18:29.166 --> 18:31.601
and you're proud, of course,

18:31.636 --> 18:34.854
but... but also sad and lonely.

18:34.855 --> 18:36.889
Yeah, no, babies are hilarious.

18:36.922 --> 18:39.457
I should probably get back out there.

18:45.532 --> 18:47.633
"I admit I stole the fruit

18:47.700 --> 18:50.735
like some Saudi Arabian street rat."

18:50.771 --> 18:52.605
- You want me to sign this?
- Yes, I do.

18:52.639 --> 18:54.807
Stop the interrogation.

18:54.874 --> 18:56.913
We found it, yeah.

18:56.913 --> 19:01.316
Look, crazy story...
it had fallen behind something.

19:01.384 --> 19:05.320
Interesting, because Garrett
just confessed to stealing it,

19:05.388 --> 19:07.155
so somebody here is lying.

19:07.223 --> 19:09.157
You know what?

19:09.225 --> 19:10.492
I don't know what's going on here,

19:10.560 --> 19:12.094
but I intend to find out.

19:12.128 --> 19:14.839
And if I have to keep everyone
here all night to do it,

19:14.840 --> 19:15.810
so be it.

19:17.233 --> 19:19.935
- No!
- I'm sorry, what?

19:19.969 --> 19:23.171
I said no! This is over, okay?

19:23.239 --> 19:24.840
I'm the Bobby here!

19:24.907 --> 19:29.010
And if you don't like it,
you can go kick a cow!

19:29.078 --> 19:32.180
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go home

19:32.248 --> 19:35.183
and cut myself
out of this hot dog costume

19:35.251 --> 19:37.185
and make love to my wife...

19:37.253 --> 19:40.021
if she's up for it.

19:54.337 --> 19:55.303
Hey.

19:55.345 --> 19:57.379
Hey, come on in.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.884
- Ahh. Oof.
- Come on in.

19:59.884 --> 20:01.484
I got the seat warmer on for you.

20:01.553 --> 20:02.753
I put it on level one;
That's my favorite

20:02.788 --> 20:03.888
'cause I don't think it's...

20:03.922 --> 20:05.256
I think it's, like, just warm enough,

20:05.290 --> 20:06.325
you know, where you're...

20:06.326 --> 20:07.860
You can put it on any level
you want, is the point.

20:07.927 --> 20:09.261
- It's great.
- Okay.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.196
- Ooh, toasty tush.
- Yeah.

20:11.264 --> 20:13.031
Okay, we should go
before someone sees us.

20:13.099 --> 20:14.967
Oh, yes, good call.

20:18.171 --> 20:19.938
Mm-hmm.

20:20.673 --> 20:22.107
Do you guys have any plans?

20:22.142 --> 20:24.042
We're seeing "Nosferatu."

20:24.110 --> 20:26.211
Yeah, I don't know why I'm going,

20:26.279 --> 20:28.514
but I'm just in a weird
head space today.

20:28.548 --> 20:30.682
Which is exactly how you want
to see German expressionism.

20:30.717 --> 20:31.950
Mm.

20:31.985 --> 20:34.186
- Uh, do you want to come?
- Uh...

20:34.220 --> 20:35.954
I mean, if you want to.

20:35.989 --> 20:37.890
I don't care if you're there.

20:37.957 --> 20:39.391
You could be there or not be there.

20:39.459 --> 20:42.628
It means nothing to me
if you're there, at all.

20:42.670 --> 20:45.005
You've charmed me. I'm in.

20:45.030 --> 20:45.851
What are you in?

20:45.866 --> 20:48.381
Uh, we're going to see
some terrible German film.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.783
The fact that it's German is irrelevant.
It's silent.

20:50.852 --> 20:52.519
Oh, this just keeps getting better.

20:52.553 --> 20:55.088
All right, I'm in too.
But I call both armrests.

20:55.122 --> 20:57.224
Uh, you should probably
button up your jacket, though,

20:57.257 --> 20:59.525
'cause it's gonna be cold.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.962
Incidentally, I'm... I'm Brexit.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.030
How has nobody asked me
about that all day?

21:06.305 --> 21:12.452
