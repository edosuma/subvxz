Previously on
The Girlfriend Experience...

00:20.896 --> 00:22.208
But I actually enjoy it.

00:22.209 --> 00:25.253
I- I like meeting new
people, I like having sex,

00:25.254 --> 00:27.589
And I only do it a few times a month.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.049
This woman, Jacqueline, vets them for me

00:29.050 --> 00:30.717
and takes care of the bookings.

00:30.718 --> 00:31.760
Why? Do you want to meet her?

00:31.761 --> 00:32.969
I can introduce you, if you want.

00:32.970 --> 00:34.721
You just have to want to do it.

00:34.722 --> 00:35.972
I'm aware of that.

00:35.973 --> 00:37.348
My big question is...

00:37.349 --> 00:40.060
Why would I go with you
when I can do this myself?

00:40.061 --> 00:43.772
The hours that you would spend
finding and then vetting clients

00:43.773 --> 00:45.774
could be spent with
clients, making money.

00:45.775 --> 00:46.900
I'm the infrastructure.

00:46.901 --> 00:49.152
You don't work for me, you work with me.

00:49.153 --> 00:51.321
And if you're unhappy,

00:51.322 --> 00:53.073
you leave.

00:53.074 --> 00:54.783
There's no contract.

00:54.784 --> 00:57.285
Don't worry. No one will
ever see your eyes.

00:58.913 --> 01:00.121
Maybe his wife's coming to town,

01:00.122 --> 01:02.791
or maybe he's just not
that into me anymore.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.266
Either way, I have to pack
up my shit and leave.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.733
Just stay with me until
you figure it out.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.764
Jacqueline won't call me back.

01:17.765 --> 01:19.265
She won't tell me why.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.169
Hi.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.337
Hey, I don't have much time,

01:49.338 --> 01:51.068
I have back-to-back
meetings all day so...

01:53.197 --> 01:55.301
I hear it went very well with Michael.

01:55.302 --> 01:57.804
I hope the whole widower
thing wasn't too intense.

01:57.805 --> 01:59.347
It's fine. I know what the deal is.

01:59.348 --> 02:00.974
Okay.

02:00.975 --> 02:03.309
I'm worried about Avery.

02:03.310 --> 02:05.728
Why won't you talk with her?

02:05.729 --> 02:07.856
Because she is erratic and unreliable.

02:07.857 --> 02:09.357
She needs some help.

02:09.358 --> 02:10.358
She's staying with me.

02:10.359 --> 02:12.902
She's not in school. She's broke.

02:12.904 --> 02:14.403
How is that my problem?

02:14.405 --> 02:17.324
She said you're taking
clients away from her.

02:17.324 --> 02:18.825
'Course she did.

02:18.826 --> 02:20.689
She loves to play the victim.

02:21.829 --> 02:23.830
I have a business to run.

02:23.831 --> 02:25.415
I have to judge pretty quickly

02:25.416 --> 02:27.376
whether I should work with someone.

02:27.376 --> 02:28.459
Because the difference between

02:28.460 --> 02:30.128
being basically able to trust someone

02:30.129 --> 02:33.256
and really being able to
trust someone is huge.

02:33.257 --> 02:35.175
What are you getting at?

02:35.176 --> 02:37.261
Christine, she booked
clients that I gave her

02:37.261 --> 02:39.467
on the side without telling me.

02:40.472 --> 02:42.147
Is that something you condone?

02:44.101 --> 02:46.227
Look, if you want to help her, help her.

02:46.228 --> 02:48.104
But if you're smart,
you'll keep your distance.

02:48.105 --> 02:49.585
Don't let her seduce you.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.864
Sorry, I really do have to go.

02:53.819 --> 02:55.062
Just...

02:56.030 --> 02:57.596
Be careful with Avery.

02:58.157 --> 02:59.219
Okay?

03:17.865 --> 03:18.843
Hi.

03:18.844 --> 03:19.928
Hi.

03:19.929 --> 03:21.096
- How are you?
- How's it goin'? Good.

03:21.096 --> 03:22.096
Good to see you.

03:22.097 --> 03:23.368
It's good to see you.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.437
Do you understand how
much I'm trusting you

03:29.438 --> 03:31.397
by telling you this?

03:31.398 --> 03:33.665
And why it took me a
while to call you back?

03:35.027 --> 03:36.475
It's really interesting.

03:38.322 --> 03:40.216
You think I'm fucked up.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.951
Not at all. You seem very clear.

03:42.952 --> 03:44.140
I am.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.559
So how's business school?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.334
Hi.

04:33.335 --> 04:34.648
Hi.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.465
Akers is out.

05:20.466 --> 05:22.134
Really?

05:22.134 --> 05:23.697
Barr confirmed it this morning.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.265
- Hey, Neil.
- Come on in.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.541
I hear you're leaving.

05:55.542 --> 05:56.584
Who told you?

05:56.585 --> 05:58.169
Carson?

05:58.170 --> 06:00.755
Yeah, it was a tough decision,
but you know how it is, David.

06:00.756 --> 06:03.257
I have my family to think of.

06:03.258 --> 06:05.259
But who knows, maybe I'll hate
it and come crawling back

06:05.260 --> 06:07.366
in a few weeks, begging
for another chance.

06:09.453 --> 06:13.267
Oh, I'm giving you LSI and Polycom.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.436
And XHP?

06:15.437 --> 06:17.105
I'm taking them with me.

06:17.106 --> 06:18.565
I don't know what else to say.

06:18.565 --> 06:20.233
They came to me, David.

06:20.234 --> 06:23.153
Fair game.

06:23.153 --> 06:26.322
How long have you known you
were leaving Kirkland?

06:26.323 --> 06:28.261
Your ten o'clock with Novak.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.163
Hey, XHP are yours.

06:34.164 --> 06:36.249
If they're unhappy with the work I did,

06:36.250 --> 06:37.709
not much I can do about it now.

06:37.709 --> 06:40.461
I just wanted you to know,
in case you need any help...

06:40.462 --> 06:41.546
transitioning.

06:41.547 --> 06:43.736
Oh, I appreciate you offering.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.635
You and Carla still coming on the 14th?

06:47.636 --> 06:48.761
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

06:48.762 --> 06:50.138
It's Carla's favorite.

06:50.139 --> 06:51.098
Great.

06:51.098 --> 06:52.494
We'll have a few in your honor.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.484
Akers is a snake.

07:03.485 --> 07:04.527
I don't give a shit.

07:04.528 --> 07:06.487
He won. You got lazy and lost XHP.

07:06.488 --> 07:07.488
Understand?

07:07.489 --> 07:08.739
I completely understand.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.825
I have no fucking idea
how to absorb this loss.

07:10.826 --> 07:12.285
They accounted for 5% of our billing.

07:12.286 --> 07:13.120
I understand.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.830
Please stop saying that.

07:15.831 --> 07:16.831
Let me fix this.

07:16.832 --> 07:18.082
How?

07:18.083 --> 07:19.292
Trust me.

07:19.293 --> 07:20.544
I can get them back.

07:20.544 --> 07:22.170
Wright is being unreasonable.

07:22.171 --> 07:24.172
These kinds of cases, they take time.

07:24.173 --> 07:26.299
He knew there were gonna be mistrials.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.593
I can turn him around.

07:28.594 --> 07:29.677
I got this.

07:29.678 --> 07:31.220
I'd really like to think I was right

07:31.221 --> 07:33.285
considering you for Managing Partner.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.191
Christine...

07:43.192 --> 07:44.942
Call accounting,

07:44.943 --> 07:47.153
and get a record of all the hours
we billed for XHP last quarter.

07:47.154 --> 07:48.529
Got it.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.260
Get it for the entire year.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.373
Fuck!

08:10.741 --> 08:11.823
Hi.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.476
Have you seen Jacqueline lately?

08:18.477 --> 08:20.186
We had coffee last week.

08:20.187 --> 08:21.479
Did she talk about me?

08:21.480 --> 08:22.480
No.

08:22.481 --> 08:24.732
Really?

08:24.733 --> 08:26.609
Are you sure my name didn't come up?

08:26.610 --> 08:28.110
Not even once?

08:28.111 --> 08:29.904
Yes. You didn't come up.

08:29.905 --> 08:31.447
'Cause she's still not
returning my phone calls.

08:31.448 --> 08:33.157
And I know she got to Garrett.

08:33.158 --> 08:34.866
I know she did. There's no other way.

08:34.868 --> 08:36.681
He was obsessed with me.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.248
I'm sorry.

08:40.249 --> 08:41.289
Do you want some?

08:41.291 --> 08:42.520
No.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.255
I dropped out.

08:47.256 --> 08:48.256
Officially.

08:48.257 --> 08:49.257
You withdrew?

08:49.258 --> 08:50.508
Yeah.

08:50.509 --> 08:53.594
I hate it. I wanna do something else.

08:53.595 --> 08:55.846
How's your coveted internship going?

08:55.847 --> 08:57.640
What are you gonna do?

08:57.641 --> 08:59.600
Blackmail her.

08:59.601 --> 09:02.228
Fuck up her life.

09:02.229 --> 09:04.918
I'm so glad not to be in
fucking law school anymore.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.318
Who knows, maybe I'll go on vacation.

09:09.319 --> 09:10.799
I love vacations.

09:33.782 --> 09:34.760
Kevin?

09:34.761 --> 09:35.761
Chelsea?

09:35.762 --> 09:37.534
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.393
Jacqueline wasn't kidding.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.978
You're stunning.

09:43.979 --> 09:45.771
Thanks.

09:45.772 --> 09:48.232
So, did she get the transfer?

09:48.233 --> 09:49.650
I assume so.

09:49.651 --> 09:51.089
Yeah, thanks.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.324
So you're here 'till Friday?

09:56.325 --> 09:57.366
Yeah...

09:57.367 --> 09:58.826
Yeah.

09:58.827 --> 10:01.329
And do you come to town often or...?

10:01.330 --> 10:02.997
No, not very often.

10:02.998 --> 10:06.626
Ah, about once every
other month or so...

10:06.627 --> 10:09.482
Although that could change.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.611
Why is that?

10:14.531 --> 10:16.052
- Because of you.
- Whoa...

10:16.053 --> 10:18.012
Kevin, slow down.

10:18.013 --> 10:20.765
For your own sake.

10:20.766 --> 10:22.767
I can tell already.

10:22.768 --> 10:25.519
Sorry.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.522
I guess I'm just a little nervous.

10:28.523 --> 10:31.609
It's been a while for me and...

10:31.610 --> 10:33.569
I'm married...

10:33.570 --> 10:35.696
And you're just...

10:35.697 --> 10:37.948
spectacular.

10:37.949 --> 10:39.971
I'm glad you think so.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.810
We have time. There's no need to rush.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.283
Relax.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.999
Touch me.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.589
Hello?

12:16.590 --> 12:17.590
Avery?

12:17.591 --> 12:19.633
She cleaned out my accounts.

12:19.634 --> 12:21.635
She took all my money.

12:21.636 --> 12:23.137
What? Who?

12:23.138 --> 12:25.598
Jacqueline.

12:25.599 --> 12:26.641
What are you talking about?

12:26.641 --> 12:28.768
She had access to your bank accounts?

12:28.769 --> 12:29.769
Yeah, I know.

12:29.770 --> 12:31.646
It was stupid of me.

12:31.646 --> 12:34.064
I'm sorry.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.760
Avery?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.681
Avery?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.121
Hi! What a surprise.

13:31.122 --> 13:33.040
Cleaned out her accounts?

13:33.041 --> 13:34.511
You know what? You know,
now's not a good time.

13:34.512 --> 13:35.376
You fucking used Avery!

13:35.377 --> 13:36.961
Avery used us both.

13:36.962 --> 13:39.193
You're a fucking leech!

13:50.413 --> 13:51.725
Fuck!

13:53.728 --> 13:55.646
Got a minute?

13:55.647 --> 13:56.918
Close the door.

14:00.402 --> 14:02.152
What were you gonna do?

14:02.153 --> 14:04.196
Make a deal. Reduce our rates.

14:04.197 --> 14:05.739
I'm not convinced that'll be enough.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.741
Everyone's got their price tag.

14:07.742 --> 14:10.369
Yeah, that much I know.

14:10.370 --> 14:12.413
You look tired.

14:12.414 --> 14:16.000
You have a way of avoiding the point.

14:16.001 --> 14:17.772
I don't wanna bring you into this.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.735
Office, can you hold please?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.726
You're late.

14:33.727 --> 14:34.810
I know, I-

14:34.811 --> 14:37.313
I had a doctor's appointment. Sorry.

14:37.314 --> 14:40.149
Erase "sorry" from your vocabulary.

14:40.150 --> 14:41.796
Just be on time.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.860
Hey...

15:09.492 --> 15:11.034
What is it?

15:11.828 --> 15:14.850
Um...

15:14.851 --> 15:17.811
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

15:17.812 --> 15:18.958
Okay.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.320
I'm thinking of leaving Jacqueline...

15:26.321 --> 15:28.364
Breaking out on my own.

15:28.365 --> 15:29.990
Ahhh...

15:29.991 --> 15:32.242
Well, she called me.

15:32.243 --> 15:34.203
I was wondering about that.

15:34.204 --> 15:36.288
I don't want to put you
in the middle of this.

15:36.289 --> 15:38.290
And you know I love
spending time with you,

15:38.291 --> 15:41.335
and I'd hate to do anything
to jeopardize that.

15:41.336 --> 15:42.753
I just...

15:42.754 --> 15:45.965
hope you'll still consider seeing me.

15:45.966 --> 15:48.529
And if you're not comfortable
with that, I can wait.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.306
Come here.

15:54.307 --> 15:58.268
Come on.

15:58.269 --> 16:02.022
Now how long have we
been seeing each other?

16:02.023 --> 16:04.942
- Nearly two months.
- Yeah, that's right.

16:04.943 --> 16:07.528
And I'm here with you.

16:07.529 --> 16:10.093
You're the one I want to
be with, not Jacqueline.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.596
Oh, come here.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.249
Just let me know how
you want to handle it.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.376
It's all good.

16:22.377 --> 16:23.564
Thank you.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.602
Susan, you didn't happen to see
who put this on my desk, did you?

17:21.603 --> 17:22.810
What is it?

17:22.811 --> 17:25.439
Just a copy of an XHP affidavit.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.045
I'll take care of it.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.575
Did you see who dropped this off for me?

17:36.576 --> 17:38.619
- No.
- Was it a messenger?

17:38.620 --> 17:41.580
Check the log.

17:41.581 --> 17:44.333
Kirkland and Allen.

17:44.334 --> 17:46.376
Sure, and how can I direct your call?

17:46.377 --> 17:48.003
Okay, please hold.

17:49.089 --> 17:50.568
Kirkland and Allen.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.081
It's already been scanned.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.482
How's your dad?

18:50.483 --> 18:52.713
Oh, you know, it is what it is.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.197
I tried that sushi place you
showed me on North Broadway.

18:57.198 --> 18:58.323
Mmm.

18:58.324 --> 18:59.575
There's Wright.

18:59.576 --> 19:02.995
The fact that he's here
is 50% of our battle.

19:02.996 --> 19:04.371
Glad you could make it.

19:04.372 --> 19:06.415
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

19:06.416 --> 19:07.807
What are you drinking?

19:07.809 --> 19:09.138
Scotch.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.286
Same as me.

19:15.418 --> 19:17.398
I'm sure you know why we asked you here.

19:17.399 --> 19:20.151
We would very much like to
continue our relationship

19:20.151 --> 19:23.362
with both yourself and XHP.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.531
Well, can we talk results?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.366
'Cause we're in legal
limbo and I just can't...

19:27.367 --> 19:28.909
I love to talk results.

19:28.910 --> 19:32.371
I can't justify what you
call "a series of mistrials"

19:32.372 --> 19:33.998
with a deal I'm pretty
sure I could pull off

19:33.999 --> 19:35.332
with my eyes closed.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.001
I understand.

19:37.002 --> 19:39.378
But these cases take time, Emery.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.505
Mistrials are a hazard of our trade.

19:41.506 --> 19:43.340
It may happen 10 or 15 more times

19:43.341 --> 19:44.842
before we get the verdict we want.

19:44.843 --> 19:47.553
I know it feels like you're
being put through the wringer.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.515
I am being put through
the fucking wringer!

19:50.515 --> 19:52.433
I can't believe I'm having
to explain this to you,

19:52.434 --> 19:54.226
the lawyers we pay to solve this!

19:54.227 --> 19:58.397
XHP is now projecting negative
$300 million for this year.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.358
Look, if you're gonna do a sales
pitch, tell me how XHP wins.

20:01.359 --> 20:04.319
It's clear you guys get paid
whether we profit or not.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.904
What is Akers offering you?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.156
You know I can't discuss that.

20:07.157 --> 20:08.449
Of course.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.075
What if we could commit
to three months for free,

20:10.076 --> 20:12.077
to get you back on our team?

20:12.078 --> 20:13.537
I'd have to send it upstairs.

20:13.538 --> 20:15.581
Six months.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.124
Work with us.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.585
Neil Akers is an excellent litigator,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.046
but moving your business to a new firm

20:22.047 --> 20:24.507
will cause a whole new
series of setbacks.

20:24.507 --> 20:27.238
How much will it cost you
to get them up to speed?

20:49.220 --> 20:51.283
Real sweet couple.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.118
Can't thank them enough.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.245
They own a chain of liquor stores

20:55.246 --> 20:58.290
and keep coming back to me to broker.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.667
And now with this hotel
they want to buy,

21:00.668 --> 21:02.961
it would really put me...

21:02.962 --> 21:05.005
on the next level.

21:05.006 --> 21:06.632
And it would mean

21:06.633 --> 21:08.592
that you and I...

21:08.593 --> 21:09.864
What would it mean?

21:12.660 --> 21:15.140
I'm just so happy to see you!

21:15.141 --> 21:17.601
I'm happy to see you, too.

21:17.602 --> 21:20.437
There are things I want to tell you.

21:20.438 --> 21:22.022
I- I shouldn't...

21:22.023 --> 21:23.294
You can tell me.

21:26.007 --> 21:28.570
I'm not crazy.

21:28.571 --> 21:31.156
I know I don't know you well,

21:31.157 --> 21:34.701
but I feel like I do.

21:34.702 --> 21:36.495
Your eyes...

21:36.496 --> 21:38.351
are so honest.

21:41.022 --> 21:45.566
I know-I-I know that sounded
like a-like a line but...

21:46.569 --> 21:50.425
I can't get you out of my head.

21:50.426 --> 21:53.637
And I don't want to.

21:53.638 --> 21:55.284
That's sweet.

21:57.288 --> 22:00.394
You don't have to say that.

22:00.395 --> 22:02.291
I know I don't have to say that.

22:04.587 --> 22:08.318
So many things I wanna tell you.

22:08.319 --> 22:10.299
Just tell me.

22:35.326 --> 22:37.389
Hey Abby, I'm late for class.
Can I call you back?

22:37.390 --> 22:39.266
Yeah, I just wanted to let
you know I'm coming to town.

22:39.267 --> 22:40.267
When?

22:40.268 --> 22:41.268
Tomorrow.

22:41.269 --> 22:42.811
Tomorrow? What time?

22:42.812 --> 22:43.896
I'm not sure yet,

22:43.897 --> 22:45.105
I'll probably get in around three.

22:45.106 --> 22:46.607
Okay, okay...

22:46.608 --> 22:48.192
okay, I love you, bye.

22:56.764 --> 22:58.347
Shit!

23:08.860 --> 23:10.339
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.466
Is there any way I can make up the test?

23:12.467 --> 23:15.177
I'm afraid not.

23:15.178 --> 23:16.782
You have ten minutes.

23:45.313 --> 23:46.812
What are you talking about?

23:48.524 --> 23:50.712
Now I'm paying you to get
me proprietary information.

23:50.713 --> 23:52.464
What part of that isn't fucking clear?

23:52.465 --> 23:55.842
Get me some useful information.

23:55.843 --> 23:58.470
Hi.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.638
You alright?

23:59.639 --> 24:00.639
Yeah...

24:00.640 --> 24:02.224
I got screwed.

24:02.225 --> 24:04.184
I need to shake it off.

24:04.185 --> 24:05.727
Wanna get drunk?

24:05.728 --> 24:08.230
Sure.

24:08.231 --> 24:10.482
He got fed the wrong information.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.817
His source fucked him.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.277
I told him not to bite.

24:13.278 --> 24:15.696
Twenty million gone
'cause he got sloppy.

24:15.697 --> 24:17.823
How long have you been partners?

24:17.824 --> 24:20.742
Too fucking long!

24:20.743 --> 24:21.743
Promise...

24:21.744 --> 24:23.829
I won't talk about it anymore.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.497
I like hearing you talk about it.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.666
It's good for you to talk about it.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.313
I like talking to you about it.

24:31.693 --> 24:33.338
I like you, Chelsea.

24:33.339 --> 24:36.008
I like you, too, Ryan.

24:36.009 --> 24:39.678
Where're you really from?

24:39.679 --> 24:41.388
Just outside of Philly.

24:41.389 --> 24:44.516
Both my parents are teachers.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.935
My mom teaches 5th grade English,

24:46.936 --> 24:49.855
and my dad teaches math in high school.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.377
What do you like to do?

24:53.256 --> 24:55.235
Be alone.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.447
You want to get married?

24:58.448 --> 25:01.491
I don't believe in marriage.

25:01.492 --> 25:02.784
Do you want kids?

25:02.785 --> 25:03.785
No...

25:03.786 --> 25:05.766
Hands down, no.

25:08.313 --> 25:10.334
What do you want?

25:10.335 --> 25:12.753
I'm studying law.

25:12.754 --> 25:14.046
I believe that.

25:14.047 --> 25:15.630
I won't ask what kind.

25:15.631 --> 25:16.944
Patent.

25:18.698 --> 25:20.719
Are your siblings as smart as you?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.596
No.

25:22.597 --> 25:24.723
My brother's great, though.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.932
Just the two of you?

25:25.933 --> 25:29.728
Yep, just one brother.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.980
You're so smart...

25:31.981 --> 25:33.669
and I'm so selfish.

25:53.733 --> 25:56.380
I'm leaving Jacqueline.

25:56.381 --> 25:58.110
Just tell me where to send the money.

26:01.866 --> 26:03.699
Take off your clothes.
