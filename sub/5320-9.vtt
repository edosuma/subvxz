Time to get it done.

Good morning!

00:43.895 --> 00:44.861
Morning.

00:44.946 --> 00:45.645
Mondays, huh?

00:45.730 --> 00:47.814
It's Wednesday, Taco.

00:47.866 --> 00:49.198
I got it.

00:51.236 --> 00:53.035
Taco.
Whoa.

00:57.125 --> 00:57.990
Well, another day,

00:58.076 --> 00:59.158
another dollar.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.460
Literally. Let's go.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.246
Oh, I-I can't
see the stairs.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.081
Oh, my God. Come on.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.383
Should have waited to put the helmet on.
You think?

01:10.004 --> 01:12.972
<i>I'm glad you're finally
going back to that bank job.</i>

01:13.007 --> 01:14.924
<i>Couldn't stay away.
I love banking.</i>

01:15.009 --> 01:17.093
Whee!
Taco, get your head back in the car!

01:18.263 --> 01:19.312
Nice spot!

01:19.347 --> 01:20.179
All right!

01:23.401 --> 01:24.650
Hey, MacArthur!

01:24.686 --> 01:25.818
Hey, Tim!

01:27.605 --> 01:29.689
I didn't know it was "Bring
Your Muppet to Work Day."

01:29.741 --> 01:31.357
What? Oh, no, no.

01:31.409 --> 01:33.492
That guy-- he's, uh...
I'm his brother!

01:33.528 --> 01:34.861
Oh, wait a minute.

01:34.913 --> 01:36.412
Are you one of those
Occupy Wall Street types?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.864
Get a job, you hippie.

01:37.916 --> 01:38.831
I didn't know you had a brother.

01:38.867 --> 01:40.082
That was the point.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.451
Hey, can I put my lunch
in your work fridge?

01:42.537 --> 01:43.618
I'm still an outside banker.

01:43.621 --> 01:44.704
Yes, Taco.

01:44.789 --> 01:46.839
The carpooling MacArthurs.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.090
Okay, um,

01:48.176 --> 01:49.342
let's just keep this
between us, Tim, all right?

01:49.377 --> 01:50.960
Oh, I... will.
I love you, brother.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.511
Taco, please. I...
Oh, my God!

01:52.547 --> 01:54.280
Have a good day at work.

02:00.021 --> 02:02.138
Four score and seven years ago,

02:02.223 --> 02:04.857
our fathers brought
onto this continent--

02:04.893 --> 02:06.726
thank you, sir--
a new nation.

02:06.811 --> 02:08.561
Come on into the bank.
And dedicated...

02:08.645 --> 02:10.562
We've got great rates on CDs.
...to the proposition...

02:10.615 --> 02:12.732
Jenny, what do we owe
the pleasure of your company?

02:12.817 --> 02:15.201
I just had to see this
with my own two eyes.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.736
I used to think I wanted
him to get a real job

02:16.821 --> 02:18.704
until he got a real job.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.039
It's like his job is just

02:20.074 --> 02:22.291
harassing people
and groping women.

02:22.377 --> 02:24.410
- No, that's Judge Warren! No, leave him alone!
- Hello, sir.

02:24.462 --> 02:26.142
Here you go. Hey!
Don't touch Judge Warren!

02:26.164 --> 02:27.413
Hey, hey, looking good! Come on!
I work with him, Taco!

02:27.498 --> 02:29.048
- Hands to yourself!
- Let him do his job.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.751
Wow, ladies love McJiblets.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.803
Not sure about that.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.254
Hey! What's up, Libby?
Hey, hello.

02:35.340 --> 02:37.974
I just ran into
your brother. Hi.

02:38.059 --> 02:40.009
He gave me this flyer,
which was really cute,

02:40.094 --> 02:41.427
and he also gave me a hug.

02:41.512 --> 02:42.845
A really aggressive hug.

02:42.931 --> 02:44.096
I apologize.
So sorry.

02:44.182 --> 02:44.981
That's what he does.
Have a seat.

02:45.066 --> 02:46.515
Oh! No thank you. I can't stay.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.184
I just came by
to personally invite you,

02:48.269 --> 02:49.819
and all of you,

02:49.904 --> 02:51.664
- to my birthday party next week.
- Oh, cool!

02:51.689 --> 02:52.605
Wow, fun!
Nice. Thank you.

02:52.657 --> 02:54.323
I intend on saying good-bye

02:54.409 --> 02:56.826
to my 20's with a hangover.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.110
Fantastic!

02:58.196 --> 02:59.236
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.087
- Yeah? Cool.
- Great.

03:00.114 --> 03:00.696
Just, uh, bump me the deets.

03:00.782 --> 03:01.664
I already did.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.332
Yeah, but I need more deets.

03:03.418 --> 03:05.785
When it's starting, the parking
information, the attire...

03:05.837 --> 03:07.453
Thank you very much
for the invitation, Libby.

03:07.538 --> 03:09.121
Sounds super fun. Yeah.
You're welcome.

03:09.207 --> 03:10.373
All right, you guys. I'll see you later.
Bye. Bye.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.791
So, saying good-bye to her 20's.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.010
Do you think that's suicide,
or just turning 30?

03:14.095 --> 03:15.511
Well, unfortunately for me,
it's turning 30.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.513
I mean, you have no idea
how stressful it is

03:17.598 --> 03:19.799
casually dating someone
who's about to turn 30.

03:19.884 --> 03:21.801
If I show up
to that birthday party,

03:21.853 --> 03:23.686
it pretty much means
I'm her boyfriend.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.439
- May even mean that we're exclusive at this point.
- Wow.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.474
You're about
to sign a long-term contract.

03:28.526 --> 03:30.693
I mean, that's at least a couple months.
Exactly!

03:30.778 --> 03:33.312
Yeah, it's like NFL teams think
really long and hard before

03:33.364 --> 03:35.398
signing a 29-year-old running
back to a long-term deal.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.233
I mean, at 30,
production goes down.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.902
Points go down, playing time
goes down, blow jobs go down.

03:39.988 --> 03:41.787
What?!
They don't go down?

03:41.823 --> 03:44.290
You're disgusting.
Pete, this is a myth.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.159
Adrian Peterson is 30,
and he is kicking ass.

03:47.245 --> 03:50.546
You are terrified of commitment,
that's what this is.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.298
- Chris Johnson!
- Hello, sir. How you doing, sir?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.883
Steven Jackson!
Really?

03:53.968 --> 03:55.251
Come on in, open up
a new checking account! - All right!

03:55.336 --> 03:56.552
Blow jobs are going <i> way</i> down.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.004
<i>I need a conference call</i>

03:58.089 --> 04:00.222
with Poesner any time this
afternoon-- MacArthur!

04:00.308 --> 04:01.757
Yes!

04:01.843 --> 04:04.510
Mr. Lipscombe.
Kind of a late lunch, don't you think?

04:04.562 --> 04:06.512
Oh, you're probably right.
Are you phoning it in

04:06.597 --> 04:07.847
for the rest of the fall,

04:07.899 --> 04:09.515
while you do your little
fantasy football thing?

04:09.600 --> 04:11.984
Or are you trying to get
kicked off the case again?

04:12.020 --> 04:13.269
Huh?
Oh, no. I apologize again. I...

04:13.354 --> 04:14.653
Ah! Just busting
your balls!

04:14.689 --> 04:17.606
Oh...
You!

04:17.692 --> 04:18.858
I like this deer in the headlights look.
Yeah.

04:18.942 --> 04:20.026
This is good.
This is good stuff.

04:20.111 --> 04:21.410
Uh, speaking of busting balls:

04:21.495 --> 04:23.245
You got a brother
who's handing out flyers

04:23.331 --> 04:25.414
in a Mr. McJiblets costume?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.999
What an idiot!

04:27.035 --> 04:28.715
I told him, "You're a dummy!"
No, he's not!

04:28.786 --> 04:30.753
I love Mr. McJiblets.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.805
Me, too.
My son loves Mr. McJiblets.

04:32.874 --> 04:35.257
- Of course. - In fact, we're gonna do
a-a birthday party for him.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.710
- We're gonna get a Mr. McJiblets
guy to come in costume. - Lovely.

04:37.762 --> 04:39.378
Oh!
Mm.

04:39.464 --> 04:41.714
Kevin, I'd like you to meet
my lovely wife Gloria.

04:41.766 --> 04:44.016
You did it again! Oh. Oh.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.887
She came down
to help me plan the party.

04:47.972 --> 04:49.688
Hello. I am Kevin MacArthur.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.964
You were laughing a second ago.

04:50.975 --> 04:52.058
What was so funny?

04:52.110 --> 04:53.309
Me?
Yeah...

04:53.394 --> 04:54.443
Yeah.
Laughing? No.

04:54.529 --> 04:56.028
I think you came over, laughing.

04:56.064 --> 04:58.064
I wasn't laughing.
You weren't laughing?

04:58.116 --> 05:00.066
No.
No. Who was laughing, then?

05:00.118 --> 05:01.901
<i>You</i> were laughing.
I was laughing?

05:01.986 --> 05:04.036
Yup.
I was laughing!

05:04.072 --> 05:07.206
Why was I laughing?
Why was I laughing?

05:07.241 --> 05:08.574
Why were you laughing?

05:08.659 --> 05:13.045
I was laughing because
I remember the time

05:13.081 --> 05:17.133
that you, me and Judge Humphries
did that thing, and...

05:17.218 --> 05:19.752
And then she said...
What did she say?

05:19.804 --> 05:21.003
She said, um... what?

05:23.424 --> 05:24.523
What did she say?

05:24.592 --> 05:26.625
She said it.
It was a thing!

05:26.677 --> 05:28.844
Um, I... was like...

05:28.930 --> 05:30.429
What did she say...?

05:32.166 --> 05:33.149
He works for you.

05:33.234 --> 05:34.600
He's the worst attorney we have.

05:34.685 --> 05:35.684
Yeah.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.106
Namaste.

05:40.158 --> 05:41.740
Andre? Andre Nowzick?

05:41.776 --> 05:43.742
Oh, my God.
Brittany Barber!

05:43.778 --> 05:45.661
Wow, I haven't seen you
since college!

05:45.746 --> 05:47.279
This is bananas!
Yeah, um...

05:47.331 --> 05:48.948
I saw that article of you

05:49.000 --> 05:50.449
in <i> Chi-Town Style</i>
about you being

05:50.501 --> 05:52.668
the number two plastic
surgeon in all of Chicago!

05:52.753 --> 05:54.420
Actually,
that's an old magazine.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.205
I am number one now.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.257
The, uh... the guy
in front of me lost his hands,

05:58.292 --> 05:59.792
so it was a no-brainer.

05:59.844 --> 06:02.005
- I've been thinking about
you, and I was... - Really?

06:02.046 --> 06:03.429
hoping we could meet up.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.431
Um, well, I would love
to meet up with you.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.682
I mean, if you're free.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.717
I will be free for you
anytime you want.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.719
Friday?
Friday is great!

06:10.805 --> 06:12.638
Yeah? Like, 2:00?
Yes! Perfect!

06:12.723 --> 06:14.803
How much time do you think
I need for a consultation?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.360
Uh... 30 minutes?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.146
Great! I can totally
squeeze that in on my lunch.

06:20.231 --> 06:21.647
I cannot wait.

06:21.699 --> 06:23.649
This is crazy. Ah, great.
Oh! Ah!

06:23.701 --> 06:25.151
All right.
Oh!

06:25.203 --> 06:26.902
Oh...
So damp.

06:26.988 --> 06:29.371
Yeah, it's, uh, hot yoga.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.892
Do you want-want a towel?
Oh, no. Also damp.

06:32.012 --> 06:33.744
Okay, yeah. Okay.
Okay.

06:35.658 --> 06:37.237
<i>Yes, it was not my finest hour,</i>

06:37.357 --> 06:38.656
but what was I supposed
to say to the guy?

06:38.742 --> 06:39.908
"I laughed in your face
because there's no way

06:39.943 --> 06:41.744
"I could imagine the two
of you being together

06:41.778 --> 06:43.306
in any situation?"

06:43.426 --> 06:44.961
Is that what it's really
about, or are you just a racist?

06:45.081 --> 06:47.291
No. I'm not racist.
I was surprised.

06:47.411 --> 06:49.127
Being surprised is not racist.

06:49.213 --> 06:52.380
I was surprised by the woman's
size, the mass, her height!

06:52.416 --> 06:55.050
I didn't even notice
the black thing until the end.

06:55.085 --> 06:57.586
It's not racist. Was I...?
What I did, was that racist?

06:57.671 --> 06:59.387
It's not racist,
but it's very rude.

06:59.423 --> 07:01.389
At least, that's the consensus
around the office.

07:01.425 --> 07:04.226
Don't tell anybody around
the office about what happened.

07:04.261 --> 07:05.677
Oh, too late--
everyone's talking about it.

07:05.762 --> 07:07.762
Jumbo, Big Chuck, Ray Ray.

07:07.848 --> 07:09.481
Ray Ray? What?

07:09.566 --> 07:11.766
And can you take the
stupid suit off, please?

07:11.818 --> 07:13.685
We're in public.
You're keeping your suit on.

07:13.770 --> 07:15.770
Plus, I'm naked
under here, so...

07:15.822 --> 07:17.272
Noir! Pinot noir.

07:17.324 --> 07:20.108
Guys, let me tell
you who I saw today.

07:20.193 --> 07:21.826
Brittany Barber.

07:21.912 --> 07:23.912
Brittany Barber?
Yeah. From college?

07:23.947 --> 07:25.330
Wow! The old college crush.

07:25.415 --> 07:26.448
How's she looking?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.199
Well, Pete, she seems absolutely

07:28.285 --> 07:30.201
fine, and she's done
quite well for herself.

07:30.287 --> 07:32.120
"Oh, she seems fine,
she's done well for herself."

07:32.172 --> 07:33.755
Look who's so objective
and calm.

07:33.790 --> 07:36.207
Andre, you were obsessed
with her in college.

07:36.293 --> 07:39.210
She came to me as a patient,
and I am simply her doctor.

07:39.296 --> 07:40.762
Nothing more.
Really?

07:40.797 --> 07:42.514
She was a long-term
investment in your yank bank.

07:42.599 --> 07:44.132
You think you're gonna
be able to examine her

07:44.217 --> 07:45.767
without making a deposit?

07:45.802 --> 07:48.386
I can keep my work bank and my
yank bank completely separate.

07:48.472 --> 07:50.272
Impossible.
Banks merge all the time.

07:50.307 --> 07:51.707
Well, not mine.
I am a professional.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.141
Professional lonely person.

07:53.226 --> 07:54.626
Look, if you're
having problems with

07:54.645 --> 07:56.926
your yank bank, and you need
someone to help you diversify

07:56.947 --> 07:58.813
and protect your interests,
I'll be your yank banker.

07:58.865 --> 08:00.231
A yank banker?

08:00.317 --> 08:01.866
I'll help keep
your accounts separate,

08:01.952 --> 08:03.568
and make sure
you don't go yankrupt.

08:03.654 --> 08:05.487
But first, I'm gonna need
to audit your yank account.

08:05.539 --> 08:06.988
Tell me about your wet dreams.

08:07.074 --> 08:08.707
I'm not telling you about my
wet dreams, thank you very much.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.991
Carpool on the way home?

08:10.043 --> 08:11.743
I'm gonna get
real wasted right now.

08:11.828 --> 08:13.495
- Do I have a choice?
- All right.

08:13.547 --> 08:15.130
Wow, single guy problems.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.831
Who would have thought,
at the beginning of the season,

08:16.883 --> 08:18.550
when we made that bet
about who would be happier

08:18.635 --> 08:20.502
at the end of the season,
that I'd be the single guy,

08:20.587 --> 08:21.886
and you'd be in a
committed relationship?

08:21.972 --> 08:23.338
I am not
in a committed relationship.

08:23.390 --> 08:25.173
I haven't decided whether
I'm offering the long-term deal

08:25.258 --> 08:26.508
to Libby yet.
Oh, really?

08:26.560 --> 08:28.426
Pete, she is a consistently
good performer,

08:28.512 --> 08:30.595
and she's exceeded all
of our expectations.

08:30.681 --> 08:33.565
First of all, Dealmaking 101--
you do not reward past behavior.

08:33.650 --> 08:35.451
I got to look to the future.
She's turning 30.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.184
Oh, my God.
Okay, what if there's a steep decline

08:37.270 --> 08:38.820
in energy and stamina?

08:38.855 --> 08:40.322
She wants to move to the suburbs

08:40.357 --> 08:42.573
and just, sort of like,
ride the pine in a mommymobile?

08:42.659 --> 08:44.859
I mean, her birthday this
year is during the day.

08:44.945 --> 08:46.611
Booty brunches are in.

08:46.697 --> 08:48.496
Get my marg on,
have some nachies.

08:48.532 --> 08:50.198
Don't do that.
No, it's a terrible thing.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.700
It means she probably wants
to go to bed at 9:00 p.m.

08:51.785 --> 08:54.002
You are afraid of commitment!
I am not afraid of commitment!

08:54.037 --> 08:56.538
I mean, maybe I am. Look,
I don't know. I can't decide.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.873
Fine, let's put it into
a context you'll understand.

08:58.959 --> 09:00.625
You're an NFL franchise,
How do you go

09:00.711 --> 09:02.427
about evaluating this player?

09:02.512 --> 09:04.212
I mean, you go to the tape.
Okay.

09:04.264 --> 09:05.547
Well, let's go
to the video tape.

09:05.599 --> 09:09.100
Ow! Yeah, girl! Oh, shit!

09:09.186 --> 09:12.303
Kelly's got the camera!
What's up, bitch! Ladies night!

09:12.389 --> 09:13.555
I'm looking at this.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.360
These are the moves
of, like, a 24-year-old.

09:15.392 --> 09:17.192
She's got great legs.

09:17.227 --> 09:19.144
Still a lot of tread
left on those tires.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.696
Okay, now watch this photo op
fail here. This is crazy.

09:21.732 --> 09:23.314
Hey, get in here. Selfie! Ow!

09:23.400 --> 09:24.532
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Ah...

09:24.568 --> 09:25.817
Oh!

09:25.902 --> 09:27.369
- Ooh!
- Oh!

09:27.437 --> 09:28.987
- Ooh. - You see the way she cuts
that corner right there?

09:29.072 --> 09:30.071
Explosive speed!

09:30.123 --> 09:31.206
No fumble.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.707
How's her ball-handling skills?

09:32.743 --> 09:35.076
You know, a gentleman
never tells, but pretty secure.

09:35.162 --> 09:36.211
- Yeah, let's look at it again.
- Yeah.

09:36.246 --> 09:37.245
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:37.330 --> 09:41.716
Hmm! Well...
Oh!

09:41.752 --> 09:43.032
When was this taken? In college?

09:43.053 --> 09:44.252
This is three weeks ago.

09:44.337 --> 09:47.055
Wow! Really?
Pete, she's pretty spry.

09:47.124 --> 09:48.590
Yeah, I mean, I don't see any
signs of slowing down, either.

09:48.642 --> 09:50.308
She could be the rare exception.

09:50.394 --> 09:51.926
You got to sign her.
Make a commitment.

09:52.012 --> 09:53.928
This is what your program needs.

09:53.980 --> 09:57.599
I know, I just... I feel like
I need a little bit more intel.

09:57.651 --> 09:58.983
Oh, please!
God, what do you need, man?

09:59.069 --> 10:00.268
Just do it!
Oh, for instance,

10:00.353 --> 10:01.770
she's having lunch downtown

10:01.822 --> 10:03.104
with her best friend tomorrow.

10:03.156 --> 10:04.906
Fine. I know someone
with a little more time

10:04.941 --> 10:06.491
on their hands than us;
he can do

10:06.576 --> 10:08.109
some scouting for us.

10:08.195 --> 10:09.611
Taco.
Taco.

10:09.663 --> 10:11.913
Taco.

10:11.948 --> 10:13.782
We literally just said that.
Together.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.333
When?
You're zoning out again.

10:15.419 --> 10:16.084
What?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.954
Andre!
Miss Barber.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.623
Brittany.
Uh, I'm here

10:21.675 --> 10:24.459
to give you your chest exam,
so, um, let's get to it.

10:24.528 --> 10:26.628
Why are you wearing that mask?

10:26.713 --> 10:28.963
This is to, you know...
It's-it's standard.

10:29.049 --> 10:30.465
Will you take off the mask?

10:30.550 --> 10:31.716
Take it off. Oh, sure.

10:31.802 --> 10:34.302
So... what do you think?
Whoa!

10:34.387 --> 10:36.271
Oh, wow! I was, um...

10:36.306 --> 10:37.806
As you can tell,
they're inverted.

10:37.858 --> 10:39.138
I didn't exp...
I wasn't expec...

10:39.142 --> 10:40.809
I wasn't expecting, um...
Wow, they're...

10:40.861 --> 10:42.310
Inverted nipples. I know.

10:42.395 --> 10:45.814
I'm so embarrassed. This is why
I-I wanted to come to a friend.

10:45.866 --> 10:48.032
No, no need to be embarrassed.

10:48.118 --> 10:49.400
Um, you...
Would you please examine them?

10:49.486 --> 10:51.035
I want to make sure

10:51.121 --> 10:53.905
that I can look normal in,
like, a tight sweater.

10:53.990 --> 10:56.708
And I want to be able
to make love with the lights on,

10:56.793 --> 10:58.243
to be able to sit on top.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.295
Well, um...

11:00.330 --> 11:03.331
uh, I have seen...

11:03.383 --> 11:06.918
everything I need to see,
and I think we are good.

11:07.003 --> 11:08.203
Do you want me to come to you?

11:08.255 --> 11:09.637
Or are you gonna come over here
and examine me?

11:09.673 --> 11:11.473
Okay, all right, so...
Okay so...

11:11.508 --> 11:12.924
Describe the problem.

11:13.009 --> 11:14.309
They're different.
They're-they're...

11:14.344 --> 11:15.844
This one is completely shy.

11:15.896 --> 11:17.011
It does not come out to play whatsoever.
Mm.

11:17.097 --> 11:18.980
Okay, I think...
Wow. Okay.

11:20.934 --> 11:22.350
The left one, on the other hand,

11:22.435 --> 11:24.152
will come out to play
if it's stimulated,

11:24.187 --> 11:25.403
like, orally, or,

11:25.489 --> 11:27.105
like, in a hot shower.
Hot shower.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.990
Or if it's, like, rubbing
up against a really

11:29.025 --> 11:30.525
soft kind of sweater.
Okay, okay. E...

11:30.610 --> 11:32.160
Or there was this one time
with honey.

11:32.195 --> 11:33.945
All right. I got it.
I've-I've-I've seen

11:34.030 --> 11:35.763
everything that I need to see.
Actually,

11:35.832 --> 11:37.198
I'm really paranoid
about breast cancer,

11:37.284 --> 11:39.450
so I was hoping
you could do an exam.

11:39.536 --> 11:42.337
Well, I'm not really
qualified, you know.

11:42.372 --> 11:43.705
Andre, you feel tits
all the time.

11:43.757 --> 11:45.206
This is no big deal.
Okay.

11:47.210 --> 11:49.177
Okay. Yup.

11:49.212 --> 11:50.545
You missed. Come here.
Okay.

11:50.630 --> 11:53.014
All right, so, I feel like,

11:53.049 --> 11:55.049
if you cup it, if you really cup it,
Yeah.

11:55.135 --> 11:56.634
and get your hands
all the way around,

11:56.720 --> 11:57.886
All right.
and move it back and forth,

11:57.938 --> 11:59.053
up and down, all around.

11:59.139 --> 12:00.299
Okay.
Here, if I make a circle

12:00.357 --> 12:01.472
with it, see?
Mm.

12:01.558 --> 12:02.838
You feel that?
Mm-hmm, I feel it.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.192
Oh!

12:04.227 --> 12:06.227
Look who came out to play!
Okay, no, that is, um...

12:06.229 --> 12:08.062
That's fine. That's fine. Um...
Really?

12:08.148 --> 12:10.221
You're being a hypochondriac, so...
Whew!

12:10.341 --> 12:13.444
Great examination, and I...
Oh, wait, one more thing.

12:13.564 --> 12:15.144
Since we're such good friends,

12:15.264 --> 12:16.614
do you mind checking out...

12:16.734 --> 12:18.733
down there?
What? Whoa! Uh, I got...

12:18.819 --> 12:21.179
I have to talk to my banker.
No, Andre, don't open the door!

12:22.304 --> 12:23.984
We were out too late last night.

12:24.739 --> 12:27.259
Why didn't we leave sooner?
We need a safe word.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.801
We <i> have</i> a safe word.
We do?

12:29.921 --> 12:31.093
Yeah, it's "White Castle."

12:33.248 --> 12:34.581
I thought you just
wanted White Castle.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.083
I did want White Castle but...

12:37.168 --> 12:39.409
Can't see.
and we get some White Castle, so that's why...

12:39.421 --> 12:40.637
Ah. That's better.

12:40.722 --> 12:42.839
Okay, White Castle it is.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.594
How are you feeling about it?

12:47.679 --> 12:49.596
I'm excited to turn 30.

12:49.648 --> 12:51.064
You're excited to turn 30?
Mm-hmm.

12:51.099 --> 12:54.039
You've been complaining
about it for weeks.

12:54.159 --> 12:55.575
That was the old Libby.

12:55.610 --> 13:00.029
I am making some changes.
I am really looking forward to...

13:00.115 --> 13:03.080
Hah! Tickle me and rub my bell.

13:03.305 --> 13:04.228
Why, hello there.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.246
Hey, you need to go.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.319
Why?
Because <i> I</i> was here first.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.371
But I need to stay, my brother.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.539
What? Your brother?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.907
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.376
I wasn't saying that
because of, uh...

13:16.462 --> 13:17.502
Are you black under there?

13:17.580 --> 13:20.080
Mm-hmm.
Let me see.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.249
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, I'm not black!

13:22.334 --> 13:23.500
I knew it. Look, hey,

13:23.552 --> 13:24.835
why are you encroaching
on our turf, man?

13:24.920 --> 13:26.720
Hey, I'm just minding
my own business,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.505
spying on that girl over there.

13:28.591 --> 13:30.474
Well, look, if I catch
you around here anymore,

13:30.509 --> 13:32.676
it's not gonna end well for you, dude.
Well, I...

13:32.728 --> 13:34.678
I'll drop your ass
like Stephen Douglas.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.514
Okay, okay!
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

13:37.600 --> 13:39.516
Hey, Dumbo,
your friends are dicks!

13:39.568 --> 13:40.767
Aah!

13:40.853 --> 13:42.686
The statue moved!

13:42.738 --> 13:44.822
MacArthur.
Oh!

13:44.857 --> 13:46.990
My wife!

13:47.026 --> 13:48.525
Shut up!
Look at her. Okay.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.494
I've got this problem
with my kid's birthday party.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.863
My Mr. McJiblets guy cancelled.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.833
I tried to find a replacement.
They're all booked solid.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.203
Your brother-- does he still
have the Mr. McJiblets suit?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.537
Yes.
Okay.

14:00.623 --> 14:02.456
Do you think
he could do the party?

14:02.541 --> 14:04.007
It's at this kids' gym downtown.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.460
If he could it,
that would be a life saver.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.178
Yes! Yes, of course!

14:08.214 --> 14:09.546
Good.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.933
I just, like... I like to laugh.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.269
I laugh a lot about nothing.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.721
Make it happen.
Yup!

14:17.773 --> 14:20.607
<i>So, I'm sorry, Pete, I
wasn't able to discover much.</i>

14:20.693 --> 14:24.144
However, I did manage
to draw this sketch.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.562
It's probably not 100% accurate.

14:25.648 --> 14:27.064
I drew it from memory.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.232
And you remember
a large tank there?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.150
Oh! I don't know
if this is useful,

14:30.236 --> 14:33.287
but I did manage to get
a urine sample from myself.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.539
Well, looks like
my work is done here, gentlemen.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.790
Sure you don't want
the urine sample?

14:36.876 --> 14:37.708
I'm good.
Okay.

14:37.743 --> 14:38.575
Hey, you forgot your sketch.

14:38.661 --> 14:41.378
Yes.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.996
Oh, don't forget we have
Lipscombe's kid's party

14:43.082 --> 14:44.665
on Saturday, all right?
We'll carpool.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.301
Fine. I'll do it, but just know
that that's beneath me.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.386
It's not a job
in the financial sector.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.388
I can't do it. I have been
having sexual thoughts

14:51.423 --> 14:53.557
about Brittany. I don't know
what to do. I need help.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.259
Are you asking me to
be your yank banker?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.393
You're dressed for it.

14:56.428 --> 14:57.678
Yeah, if you can help me,
then, yes.

14:57.763 --> 14:58.729
Well, here's
your problem, Andre.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.347
You've got comingled accounts.

15:00.432 --> 15:01.765
Right.
As your ya

15:01.817 --> 15:03.267
I strongly urge you
to be in compliance

15:03.319 --> 15:05.269
with the Glass-Steagall
Act of yanking.

15:05.354 --> 15:07.154
Freeze all activity
on these accounts

15:07.239 --> 15:08.522
until we can clear the books.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.357
But she's a patient.
I have to operate.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.283
No, Andre, you have to stop.
You can't operate.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.694
You can't see her anymore.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.946
You hear me? Or else I'm
not gonna be able to ensure

15:15.998 --> 15:18.198
your yank account
with EBDBBnB FDIC.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.366
FDIC?

15:19.451 --> 15:20.250
Yeah, forbid dick and...

15:20.286 --> 15:22.002
Forget it! Sorry, forget it.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.787
Taco, What you don't realize is
that she's a friend, and...

15:23.839 --> 15:26.673
Andre! You have to stop this
little Ponzi scheme right now,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.258
or else you're gonna
be left with nothing.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.626
You won't be able to operate,

15:29.678 --> 15:31.295
and you won't be
able to masturbate.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.464
Mark my words, she
will yankrupt you.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.633
Yankrupt.
Yeah. And feel free

15:36.685 --> 15:38.268
to call me any time of day.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.720
I work yankers hours,

15:39.805 --> 15:42.522
but, for you, I'll be avail 24/7.
Thank you.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.391
Taco, you're getting
hair in our food.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.310
It's not my hair.
Whose hair is purple?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.811
Check the cooks.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.479
<i>The party's at</i>

15:49.531 --> 15:51.064
a kids' gym
around here somewhere,

15:51.150 --> 15:52.699
but I'm not exactly sure where.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.984
Yes, I'll hold.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.452
Who are you on the phone with?

15:55.487 --> 15:56.903
It's Andre's service.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.405
I'm really worried.
He hasn't called me back.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.324
Oh, that's usually a good thing.
Yes, hi.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.992
I really need to talk to him.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.961
I'm, uh... I'm a
patient of his.

16:03.996 --> 16:07.831
Yeah, he performed my...
penile... sharpening.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.715
Sharpening?
I don't know.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.000
What is wrong with you?

16:10.085 --> 16:11.668
What do you mean,
he's in surgery?

16:11.720 --> 16:15.255
No, no, no, no, no!
That's impossible! Shit!

16:15.341 --> 16:16.340
Listen, brother, I got to go.

16:16.425 --> 16:17.507
What?
I can't do this.

16:17.593 --> 16:18.675
No! You don't have to go!

16:18.727 --> 16:20.227
What are you wearing?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.429
A yank banker always
comes prepared!

16:22.514 --> 16:24.898
- Taco, you have to come to this
party with me, in this outfit! - No, no, no...

16:24.984 --> 16:26.984
I'm sorry, I can't help you!
No, you can help me!

16:27.019 --> 16:28.235
I'm coming, Andre!

16:28.320 --> 16:29.936
Help me, Taco, please!

16:30.022 --> 16:32.155
Taco, get back here! Taco!

16:33.692 --> 16:35.942
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

16:39.915 --> 16:41.448
Excuse me, do you know
where this building is?

16:41.533 --> 16:42.949
I'm looking
for a birthday party.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.368
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm looking
for this child's birthday party.

16:44.453 --> 16:46.453
Do you know where
this building is?

16:46.538 --> 16:48.588
I'm looking for this child's
birthday party.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.424
Do you know where
this address is? No? No?

16:52.461 --> 16:53.877
Oh, hey, guys, I'm looking for
this kid's birthday party.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.429
Can you help me? Whoa!

16:55.514 --> 16:57.047
I thought we told you
to get the hell out of here!

16:57.132 --> 16:59.012
Looks like somebody
forgot their history lesson.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.885
Guys, I don't know what
you're talking about here, okay?

17:01.937 --> 17:03.720
Just take it easy, brother.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.188
Brother? Oh, hell, no!
What?

17:05.223 --> 17:07.223
He just called me brother!
Uh-oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

17:07.276 --> 17:08.892
Hey! Where you going?
Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:08.977 --> 17:10.977
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>
Lincoln, no!

17:11.063 --> 17:12.896
Get back here!
Oh, help!

17:12.981 --> 17:13.864
Help!

17:15.733 --> 17:17.067
Good to see you!

17:17.118 --> 17:18.318
Order my shots!
Hey, girl!

17:18.404 --> 17:20.704
How are you?
Happy birthday!

17:20.739 --> 17:23.540
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.575
Thanks for coming!
Ooh. Nice move.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.160
Ladies, to dirty 30!
Ah.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.631
Total package.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.500
Hey, Libby.

17:33.585 --> 17:34.751
Hi!
How's it going?

17:34.803 --> 17:37.254
Oh, I'm so happy you came!
Happy birthday!

17:37.306 --> 17:38.839
Thank you!
So,

17:38.924 --> 17:40.090
things have been
really great between us.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.758
Yeah.
But I've been thinking,

17:41.810 --> 17:45.095
what if we entered
into a more long-term deal?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.180
I got you this,

17:47.266 --> 17:50.984
and I'm hoping we can have
a great year together.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.770
Oh, that's really
pretty. Keep it?

17:53.822 --> 17:56.573
- Okay. - Look, turning 30 has got
me doing some thinking,

17:56.608 --> 17:59.993
and you're right,
we have fun together.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.028
We have a lot of fun together.

18:02.114 --> 18:05.449
Yeah.
And you don't want to be serious with me.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.034
Put that away. I don't
want to be serious with you,

18:08.120 --> 18:09.953
and when I am ready
to be serious,

18:10.038 --> 18:12.756
I want it to be with someone
I can go... all the way with.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.424
Got it, and you're not sure
I'm the guy

18:14.460 --> 18:16.061
who's gonna be able
to get you that ring.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.961
<i>You're</i> not sure.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.097
Uh, that's fair.
All right, so what is this then?

18:20.132 --> 18:21.932
Free agency?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.633
Free agency. Yeah, I can
get on board with that.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.801
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:24.887 --> 18:25.936
Well, let's drink
to that. Shot?

18:25.971 --> 18:27.053
Fair enough.
Okay.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.605
Why are you chasing me? Help!

18:28.640 --> 18:30.307
How dare you!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

18:30.392 --> 18:32.309
One more, please!

18:32.394 --> 18:33.810
Somebody help me!
Help! Help!

18:33.862 --> 18:35.862
You son of a bitch!
I'll... Aah!

18:35.948 --> 18:37.280
Leave me alone!

18:37.316 --> 18:38.064
- Huh?
- Please!

18:38.150 --> 18:39.232
Help!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.736
Oh! Ford's Theatre!

18:42.821 --> 18:44.204
- Ooh!
- Oh! Ow! Aah!

18:44.289 --> 18:45.989
Are you okay?

18:46.041 --> 18:47.491
My knee!

18:47.576 --> 18:50.043
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry, Libby.
I think I blew her knee out!

18:50.129 --> 18:52.295
And that's kind of why you sign a
guaranteed contract.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.266
I might take this
offer off the table.

18:56.192 --> 18:59.395
Okay, Brittany, we're just gonna
make two small incisions

18:59.515 --> 19:02.717
right there.
I'm so glad it's you doing this.

19:02.802 --> 19:04.457
I don't think I'd be able
to trust anyone else.

19:04.573 --> 19:07.574
I just want you to know, I'm
gonna do the best job possible

19:07.626 --> 19:10.628
because I have
such strong feelings for you.

19:11.487 --> 19:12.542
Excuse me?

19:12.662 --> 19:15.363
I want you to feel as beautiful

19:15.415 --> 19:17.248
as I think you look.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.749
Are you hitting on me right now?

19:18.835 --> 19:19.950
No, I'm not just hitting on you.

19:20.036 --> 19:21.871
It-it's more than that.
You see it's, uh...

19:25.958 --> 19:27.708
Did you just draw a heart on me?
Yeah.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.794
'Cause I heart you.

19:29.879 --> 19:33.431
Ew! Why do you think this
is appropriate to do right now?

19:33.516 --> 19:35.049
It's romantic!
You know, it's

19:35.101 --> 19:37.218
the story that we're gonna
tell our kids, and...

19:37.303 --> 19:38.719
No! no, no, no, no, no!

19:38.805 --> 19:40.604
Get me out of here!
This is unprofessional...

19:40.690 --> 19:42.723
Okay, I might have
misrepresented myself, right?

19:42.809 --> 19:44.525
I don't want to...

19:44.560 --> 19:47.028
Put your mask back on!
I don't want to put the mask back on.

19:47.063 --> 19:49.730
I've been wearing a mask
since college, okay?

19:49.782 --> 19:51.282
And I don't want
to do it anymore!

19:51.367 --> 19:53.818
I want my work bank and
my yank bank to merge.

19:53.903 --> 19:55.953
You are the first customer

19:56.039 --> 19:58.205
at the First United Bank
of Work and Yank,

19:58.241 --> 20:00.194
and your free gift is a hug.

20:00.314 --> 20:01.730
Ew!

20:01.782 --> 20:02.948
Don't touch me!
Get away from me!

20:03.033 --> 20:04.533
I want to get out of here!

20:04.568 --> 20:05.984
Okay, okay, just,
let's forget about it.

20:06.070 --> 20:06.838
And I'm sorry,
and we can just...

20:07.124 --> 20:10.987
No, you are not going to hit
on me, and then knock me out!

20:11.107 --> 20:12.637
No, thank you, Dr. Huxtable!

20:12.757 --> 20:13.671
Forget it.
I just meant that...

20:13.791 --> 20:16.263
Everybody, put your hands up!
This is a yank robbery!

20:16.383 --> 20:17.118
Taco?!

20:17.238 --> 20:19.680
Step away from the breasts,
Andre. Don't be a hero.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.636
I'm in the middle
of an operation!

20:20.721 --> 20:21.803
I can't let you operate
on somebody

20:21.889 --> 20:23.305
you just masturbated to!

20:23.357 --> 20:24.640
What?!
I'm so sorry.

20:24.692 --> 20:26.775
You! Unplug her I.V.,
and no one gets hurt.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.310
Oh, thank God.
Please, get me out of here.

20:28.362 --> 20:31.313
How can you be a yank robber and
a yank banker at the same time?

20:31.365 --> 20:32.814
It's an inside job!

20:32.867 --> 20:35.534
I never want to see you again!
I am suing for malpractice!

20:35.619 --> 20:37.822
Hey, do you have money for parking?
Sure.

20:37.942 --> 20:38.942
Okay, great.
I'm Brittany.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.910
I'm Taco. Nice to meet you.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.070
I'm yankrupt.
