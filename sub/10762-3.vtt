WEBVTT

00:08.575 --> 00:10.076
A hell of a breakfast, Daph.
I'm stuffed.

00:10.076 --> 00:12.078
Thanks. Now come on,
let's do some exercise
s.

00:12.078 --> 00:13.580
And risk a cramp?

00:14.080 --> 00:16.883
What kind of training
did you get?

00:17.083 --> 00:18.051
FRASIER:
Good morning.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.419
Hey, Fras.
Morning.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.420
Want some breakfast?

00:20.420 --> 00:21.421
Oh, uh, no, thanks.

00:21.421 --> 00:22.922
Coffee will be fine.

00:22.922 --> 00:23.923
Hi, Daph, uh, listen,

00:23.923 --> 00:26.192
I could use
an objective opinion.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.961
I am running for
condo board president.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.263
I want to know what you think
of this as a slogan:

00:30.263 --> 00:34.000
"Frasier Crane:
the People's Elixir."

00:36.403 --> 00:40.774
Okay, I'm ready
for my exercises now.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.275
Please, Dad, this is serious.

00:42.275 --> 00:43.652
I have a feeling
this could be my year.

00:44.277 --> 00:45.712
Don't you say that every year?

00:46.012 --> 00:47.080
Yes, I do, but this year

00:47.080 --> 00:49.082
I'm the only one running
against the incumbent,

00:49.082 --> 00:50.016
which means the people
will rally

00:50.583 --> 00:52.552
their inchoate yearnings
for change behind my banner.

00:52.952 --> 00:54.500
Well, you're full
of catchy slogans.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.122
Frasier, don't
 get

00:56.556 --> 00:57.624
your hopes up too high.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.626
I mean, name one person
on the condo board

00:59.626 --> 01:01.061
you haven't ticked off
at least once.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.496
That's just because
I have a type-A,

01:03.496 --> 01:05.465
hands-on, get-it-done
personality.

01:05.865 --> 01:08.701
Seriously, name one.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.969
You know, Frase, you might be

01:10.403 --> 01:12.472
the best man for the job,
but a friendly smile

01:12.472 --> 01:13.973
and a "How do you do?"
in the hallway

01:13.973 --> 01:16.476
goes a lot further than being
"the People's Laxative."

01:18.411 --> 01:21.915
Elixir.

01:22.282 --> 01:25.652
Well, I suppose
you're right.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.323
I haven't really established
myself as the neighborly sort.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.958
I thought that my term

01:32.158 --> 01:34.727
as fire safety captain
might do the trick,

01:34.727 --> 01:39.599
but... I guess I drilled them
once too often.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.335
Maybe you could give him lessons
on how to be a normal person.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.537
I beg your pardon?

01:44.904 --> 01:45.972
Say, I've got an idea.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.374
Dad, why don't you just run?

01:48.675 --> 01:49.709
Why would I want to do that?

01:50.143 --> 01:52.212
Well, because then the people
would get their regular guy

01:52.712 --> 01:55.048
but he would have
my political agenda.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.916
,
I get it.
Your father's the figurehead

01:56.916 --> 01:58.918
like Woodrow Wilson
when he had that stroke

01:58.918 --> 02:00.787
and his wife secretly
acted as president.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.288
Yes, exactly.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.857
But, of course, Dad would
be conscious, presumably.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.291
(laughs)

02:05.658 --> 02:07.227
How did you
know about that?

02:07.694 --> 02:10.196
I'm studying for
 my citizenship exam.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.198
It's about time I became
an American like everyone else.

02:12.198 --> 02:16.202
y.
If you were like everyone else,
you wouldn't know any histor

02:16.202 --> 02:19.072
So, Dad, what do you think?

02:19.372 --> 02:21.741
.
I don't know...
sounds like a big pain

02:21.741 --> 02:22.542
Oh, come on, Dad.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.043
Think of the neighbors.

02:24.043 --> 02:27.380
Think of the building,
the good we could do together.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.449
We can actually achieve

02:29.449 --> 02:32.385
the dream
of luxury apartment living

02:32.385 --> 02:34.420
that our founders intended.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.290
.
Plus, I'll do all the work

02:37.657 --> 02:39.225
I'll tell you something
I always thought we needed:

02:39.225 --> 02:42.228
d.
wider parking spaces
so the doors don't get dinge

02:42.228 --> 02:43.296
All right,
you do this for me

02:43.296 --> 02:45.198
?
I'll make sure
that gets done.
Really

02:45.532 --> 02:47.100
Absolutely... Mr. President.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.502
I like the sound of that.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.904
(both laughing)

02:50.904 --> 02:52.906
Now, I think I should
still run against you.

02:52.906 --> 02:53.907
Why?

02:54.407 --> 02:56.376
Well, if I drop out just as you
announce your candidacy,

02:56.743 --> 02:57.744
people might suspect
something's up.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.246
It's better that our
political legerdemain

03:00.246 --> 03:03.316
remain sub rosa, hmm?

03:03.316 --> 03:05.685
How would a normal person
say that, Dad?

03:05.685 --> 03:09.088
No one needs to know
how the hot dogs are made.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.259
This is going to be sweet.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.999
Which brings me to
my final opponent...

03:19.999 --> 03:21.367
Martin Crane.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.269
Now, we're all well aware

03:23.269 --> 03:25.271
that he is a
decorated war hero

03:25.271 --> 03:27.407
and a much-honored police officer,

03:27.407 --> 03:32.779
but does he have the
building's interests at heart?

03:32.779 --> 03:35.582
Maybe.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.550
I simply ask that you

03:37.984 --> 03:41.821
stack up his 45
years of experience

03:42.055 --> 03:46.559
against my term
as fire safety captain.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.228
Thank you...

03:48.228 --> 03:50.830
and God Bless Elliot Bay Towers.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.899
(light applause)

03:52.899 --> 03:55.702
And now we'll hear
from Martin Crane.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.237
(cheering and applause)

03:57.237 --> 03:59.272
(chuckling)

03:59.272 --> 04:02.108
Uh, thanks,
I'm Marty Crane.

04:02.108 --> 04:06.446
Uh, I just want to say
that it's a privilege to run

04:06.446 --> 04:08.948
and, uh, I'll try to do
the best I can.

04:08.948 --> 04:12.252
Thank you, and... go Seahawks!

04:12.518 --> 04:14.587
(applause)

04:14.587 --> 04:17.523
PAUL:
Here's where we'd hear from our third candidate

04:17.523 --> 04:20.360
current president Jim McIntyre,
but, uh...

04:20.360 --> 04:24.130
last night he informed me that
we was giving up condo board

04:24.130 --> 04:26.132
in order to pursue his dream

04:26.132 --> 04:28.768
of teaching English
as a second language.

04:28.768 --> 04:33.339
Dream? Or court-ordered community service?

04:34.907 --> 04:37.343
So, I guess it's time to vote.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.678
Well, I wish
we would have known

04:38.678 --> 04:39.679
that guy
wasn't going to run.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.147
I wouldn't have had
to spend all night

04:41.648 --> 04:42.649
working on my speech.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.685
Yes... plus, I would
automatically be
president now.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.187
Yeah. Even you couldn't lose
a one-man election.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.890
8.
Hmm? You're forgetting 199

04:50.890 --> 04:54.060
Oh, yeah, when you lost
to the dead guy.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.129
He wasn't dead, he was in a coma.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.998
How was I supposed
to compete with that?

04:58.998 --> 05:01.734
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
we have winner

05:01.734 --> 05:03.970
in a surprisingly

05:03.970 --> 05:07.840
close vote of 15 to two.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.176
Our new president
is Martin Crane.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.011
Yes!

05:12.011 --> 05:14.013
I got two votes.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.018
Bye-bye.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.522
Oh... what a great massage.

05:22.522 --> 05:25.525
It's too bad her English
wasn't better.

05:25.525 --> 05:28.027
She could have told
us some of her secrets.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.530
Yes, but now we know that Urdu

05:30.530 --> 05:32.532
is the official language
of heaven.

05:33.032 --> 05:34.400
I could go for a snack.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.735
Want some pâât￩?

05:35.735 --> 05:36.736
No, thanks

05:36.736 --> 05:37.637
Some cheese?

05:37.637 --> 05:38.538
No.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.472
Pâât￩?

05:39.472 --> 05:41.441
Again, no.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.909
How about a salad?

05:43.309 --> 05:44.377
Or a fruit salad?

05:44.377 --> 05:45.878
Ooh, I could throw together
a little m￩lange.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.380
(doorbell rings)

05:47.380 --> 05:48.381
I'll get it.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.383
A m￩lange sounds lovely.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.387
Roz, I thought you were going out

05:54.387 --> 05:55.388
with that man from your gym.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.223
We didn't even make it
to dinner.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.058
Here's your never-fail
date purse back.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.393
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.061
No, come on in

06:02.061 --> 06:02.862
Are you sure?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.364
You look like
you're going to bed.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.331
No, we just
got a massage.

06:05.331 --> 06:06.766
Come in.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.235
Oh, boy a massage
sounds wonderful.

06:09.736 --> 06:13.239
She did the most incredible
thing to my neck.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.774
Here, let me show you.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.276
Oh...

06:17.276 --> 06:18.778
Mm-hmm.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.279
So, how could you tell

06:20.279 --> 06:21.781
your date wasn't meant to be?

06:21.781 --> 06:24.684
He had the same purse.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.587
Wow, that feels so good.

06:27.587 --> 06:28.855
Mm-hmm

06:28.855 --> 06:29.589
Ooh, hi, Roz.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.023
Hi.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.392
Poor thing had a bad date.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:34.260 --> 06:37.096
Well, now that Daphne's helping you relax,

06:37.096 --> 06:40.166
you want to join us
in a little m￩lange?

06:48.341 --> 06:49.709
What?

06:49.709 --> 06:50.610
You'll love it.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.612
Niles is amazing.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.115
Wait, what are you saying?

06:56.115 --> 06:58.017
Unless you have
other plans.

06:58.384 --> 07:01.954
Well... I guess not, but...

07:03.456 --> 07:04.390
Great.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.793
Then here you go.

07:07.326 --> 07:11.197
Oh... fruit salad.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.765
Oh, my God.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.768
I thought you said "m￩nage."

07:15.768 --> 07:19.305
(laughing)

07:19.305 --> 07:23.910
Well, the fruits
do mix a little
promiscuously.

07:23.910 --> 07:24.811
ROZ:
I mean, I was thinking

07:25.211 --> 07:26.612
"Oh, my God,
what are they saying?"

07:26.913 --> 07:28.981
Rest assured we would have offered you

07:29.482 --> 07:30.983
something more
than fruit salad

07:30.983 --> 07:32.385
to get you
in the mood.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.287
You know what?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.622
She didn't say "no."

07:39.992 --> 07:41.961
You're right, she didn't.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.431
It was only because it was so
weird I didn't know what to say.

07:45.431 --> 07:46.833
Is that why?

07:46.833 --> 07:49.669
I think someone
has a little crush on us.

07:49.669 --> 07:50.837
You wish.

07:50.837 --> 07:53.039
We know what you wish.

07:53.039 --> 07:53.840
Okay, okay, forget it.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.341
Let's talk about something else.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.776
What are you guys going to do
 this weekend?

07:56.776 --> 07:59.178
You, if you get your way.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.180
(laughing)

08:04.717 --> 08:06.719
So, if we had have asked you
you would have said "no"?

08:06.719 --> 08:08.154
Of course I would have.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.589
I see. And what's wrong
with us?

08:10.056 --> 08:11.090
Do you find us
unattractive?

08:11.090 --> 08:12.592
What if we wore masks?

08:12.592 --> 08:14.093
Oh, that'd have to be
Nixon and Frankenstein.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.895
That's all we've got.
All right, you guys!

08:15.895 --> 08:17.196
Stop it.

08:17.196 --> 08:18.698
I'm sorry I didn't understand

08:18.698 --> 08:20.199
your little code word
for fruit salad.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.534
DAPHNE:
We're sorry.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.870
Here you haven't even had dinner
and we're teasing you.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.871
Oh, you haven't?
I didn't know that.

08:25.371 --> 08:26.205
Let me make
you something.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.040
No, it's okay.
I'm not that hungry.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.342
Oh, come on.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.945
Well, all right,
I wouldn't say no to a sandwich.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.748
(both laughing)

08:38.751 --> 08:40.753
Yes, he's doing
a hell of a job, isn't he?

08:40.753 --> 08:41.754
Oh, listen,
what did you think

08:42.255 --> 08:43.256
of the new plants
in the lobby?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.757
Dad was particularly pleased

08:44.757 --> 08:46.759
with how they complemented
the filigree in the sconces.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.263
Don't tell people that.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.767
Yes, I suppose
the best man did win.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.269
Bye-bye.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.171
Another satisfied
constituent.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.341
(doorbell rings)
Well, whoop-de-do.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.144
Hello.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.646
Frasier. Hey, Marty...

09:06.646 --> 09:07.580
Hey, Paul.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.615
I just came down
to congratulate you.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.151
Every president talks about
getting new dryers

09:12.151 --> 09:14.153
but you finally
did something about it.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.089
You see, Dad, they love what
you're doing for the building.

09:17.089 --> 09:20.159
Of course, the sting of losing
was quite painful,

09:20.593 --> 09:23.095
but it's worth it
if we can have a laundry room

09:23.095 --> 09:25.665
that can take us
into the 21st century.

09:25.665 --> 09:29.168
You're being a good sport
about this, Frasier.

09:29.168 --> 09:32.171
Well, you know, public-
spiritedness is the Crane code.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.172
Right on.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.174
Uh, Paul, could you, uh.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.642
Oh, sure.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.110
Hey, is it okay if I move
the recycling bins

09:38.110 --> 09:39.612
down to the landing
at the bottom of the stairs?

09:39.612 --> 09:41.013
Knock yourself out.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.281
Great. Thanks.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.253
Is this going to be a problem?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.254
What?

09:48.754 --> 09:52.158
I think we need to reach
a little understanding.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.894
Now, if someone asks you
a question,

09:54.894 --> 09:56.262
you look at me.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.265
If I scratch my nose...

10:00.766 --> 10:01.767
...it means "no."

10:01.767 --> 10:03.269
You get it?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.138
They both begin with the same
two letters-- N-O.

10:06.472 --> 10:08.441
Now, if I

10:08.741 --> 10:11.310
touch my eye...

10:11.777 --> 10:16.816
it means "aye," as in "yes."

10:16.816 --> 10:19.819
Guess what you're being
if I touch my ass.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.290
Dad...

10:24.290 --> 10:25.291
I think I can at least

10:25.291 --> 10:27.293
take care of the no-brainer decisions myself.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.794
That is not how
this is supposed to work.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.763
Well, I thought how this
was supposed to work

10:30.763 --> 10:32.331
was that if I agreed to do this

10:32.331 --> 10:34.100
you'd do the one thing
I asked for.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.668
Yes, wider parking spaces.

10:35.668 --> 10:38.170
But I have five years of ideas
here to implement first.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.271
Five years?!

10:39.271 --> 10:40.840
By the time
I get my parking space

10:40.840 --> 10:42.842
I'll be driving
a three-wheeled scooter

10:42.842 --> 10:44.143
with an oxygen tank on the back.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.978
Look, even if I could
fast-track it,

10:45.978 --> 10:47.980
there are feasibility studies
to be done.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.483
There's a committee review and
there's a bidding process.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.252
You can't just hire some guy with a can of paint.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.453
That's what I'd do.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.990
Well, that is why
you're not in charge.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.259
Now...

11:00.459 --> 11:03.029
here's your agenda
for the next meeting.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.031
Make sure that you follow it
to the letter.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.033
Yes, master.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.534
Dad, I sense you

11:08.968 --> 11:12.038
chafing under the cruel yoke
of public service.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.507
Remember, we must subordinate
our own wishes

11:14.507 --> 11:16.509
for the good of the building.

11:16.509 --> 11:21.013
And that is not one
of our hand signals.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.519
Next item, a study

11:26.519 --> 11:29.822
to determine the
feasibility of putting

11:30.022 --> 11:34.093
something on the roof.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.061
Any volunteers?

11:35.061 --> 11:39.065
I volunteer,
and I would like to explore

11:39.065 --> 11:42.902
the idea of putting
a patio on the roof.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.671
All right. Well, that
about wraps things up.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.073
Uh, query.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.541
Recognized.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.876
Wasn't there something else
you wanted to bring up?

11:51.177 --> 11:52.244
No. Don't think so.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.612
Are you sure?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.948
I-I could have sworn
I heard the president

11:56.449 --> 11:58.884
say something
about a new ventilation system.

11:59.251 --> 12:00.319
Oh, we've done enough
for tonight.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.287
No, you haven't!

12:07.660 --> 12:11.230
I'm certain that if you
simply consult the agenda

12:11.230 --> 12:13.232
which you
so painstakingly prepared,

12:13.232 --> 12:16.702
you will find that there is
one last item.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.037
Oh, yeah.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.305
Here it is

12:19.305 --> 12:20.806
Wider parking spaces.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.641
MAN:
Oh, that's good.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.310
Real good.
Great idea.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.078
Classic Marty.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.516
No. Wider.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.486
Those in favor
of better parking?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.487
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

12:34.887 --> 12:35.888
Opposed to better parking?

12:36.222 --> 12:37.323
Nay!
Motion carries.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.758
Query!
Not recognized.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.160
Marty, I'm afraid
I have to interrupt.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.095
There's a delivery for you.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.530
Bring it in, Mrs. Richman.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.799
Here we go.

12:47.233 --> 12:47.800
Whoa. A cake.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.301
What's the occasion?

12:49.301 --> 12:51.303
We wanted to show you
our appreciation

12:51.303 --> 12:53.672
for all the great things
you've done for us.

12:53.973 --> 12:58.310
.
Wow! I never thought
I'd see myself in frosting

12:58.544 --> 12:59.612
In the last couple
of weeks,

12:59.612 --> 13:01.113
you've done more
for this building

13:01.113 --> 13:03.115
than the last
two presidents combined.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.117
Where did you get
all these great ideas?

13:05.117 --> 13:06.118
Oh, I don't know.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.686
They just come to me

13:07.686 --> 13:10.122
while I'm trying to watch TV

13:11.457 --> 13:13.225
Why don't you
make yourself useful

13:13.225 --> 13:14.493
and cut the cake, Frasier?

13:16.295 --> 13:20.299
My pleasure, Mr. President.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:40.386 --> 13:42.655
Hello.

13:42.922 --> 13:43.956
Oh, don't be sore.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.492
I'll get to the ventilation system eventually.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.294
You went back
on our agreement.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.629
I'm the one who's suppos
 to call the shots around here.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.199
Our agreement was that I'd get wider parking spaces

13:53.199 --> 13:54.600
but you blew me off.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.435
As far as I'm concerned

13:56.435 --> 13:57.837
the agreement is over.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.839
Besides, I think
I have a knack

13:59.839 --> 14:01.841
for this president thing.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.144
Now, I'd like to keep you

14:05.144 --> 14:07.479
on my team,
but if it's too rough for you

14:07.980 --> 14:09.815
just say the word.

14:09.815 --> 14:14.186
Well, well, well.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.689
The puppet thinks
he's a real boy.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.799
I don't think you have
the skills for this job.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.902
I have something better--
people skills.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.738
So do I, but
these boobs and nincompoops

14:32.738 --> 14:34.640
are too stupid to see it!

14:34.640 --> 14:37.009
Well, if you're so sure you're indispensable

14:37.509 --> 14:39.511
maybe you should
run for president.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.982
Oh, wait. You did. Five times.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.950
They wouldn't
love you so much

14:44.950 --> 14:46.385
if it weren't
for my ideas!

14:46.385 --> 14:48.387
Right, because you need a PhD

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
to think about repainting
the lobby.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.324
Oh, wait. You don't.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.226
Would you stop doing that?

14:54.226 --> 14:55.194
You're right.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.229
It's not an effective
way to argue.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.231
Oh, wait. It is.

15:04.169 --> 15:07.239
DAPHNE:
Don't you just love this part of American history?

15:07.239 --> 15:09.241
I'm not much
of a Civil War buff.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.243
Really? It's fascinating--

15:11.243 --> 15:13.746
much more so than
the English Civil War.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.681
Impossible.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.617
Didn't you want to be there when Charles I

15:18.617 --> 15:21.520
unfurled his standard
at Nottingham in 1642?

15:21.520 --> 15:22.922
Ugh. You sound like school.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.456
We'll let Frasier settle it.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.358
Which civil war
was more interesting?

15:26.358 --> 15:27.726
Spanish!

15:27.726 --> 15:29.528
But I don't
have time to prove it.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.263
I've got to go
confront Evita Peron

15:31.263 --> 15:33.098
at the condo board
meeting tonight.

15:33.098 --> 15:33.966
Dad?
Yes.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.434
I thought he
was doing a good job.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.902
Well, he was--

15:36.902 --> 15:38.771
until he started
to think for himself.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.306
He's so damn popular

15:40.306 --> 15:41.807
everybody else just follows along.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.108
It's like the blind leading the blind.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.910
Well...
But it will not stand!

15:44.910 --> 15:46.912
As soon as he calls
for new business tonight

15:47.413 --> 15:49.415
I am going to leap to my feet
and expose him

15:49.415 --> 15:51.417
for the power-mad dictator
that he's become.

15:51.917 --> 15:52.918
Mm. Mmm, mm, mm.

15:52.918 --> 15:56.622
Then I'll take over.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.024
Maybe you should
take it easy on your father.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.326
Why?!

16:00.793 --> 16:01.860
Because he's getting out more,

16:01.860 --> 16:03.362
having fun with other
people in the building.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.264
You can't take that
away from him.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.665
You get to be a big shot
all the time.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.667
This is Dad's turn
in the limelight.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.035
It's good for his self-esteem.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.272
I don't know why
I even talk to you people.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.642
Frasier.
Not now!

16:16.642 --> 16:19.144
Okay!

16:19.144 --> 16:20.646
Hi. Can I join you guys?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.147
Oh.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.149
I think someone is
coming on to us.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.988
Someone just can't
leave us alone.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.422
Ok

16:30.422 --> 16:32.891
You guys have been doing this
for over two weeks.

16:32.891 --> 16:33.859
Lay off.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.327
I thought laying off

16:35.327 --> 16:37.830
was exactly what you didn't
want us to do.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.832
That's a good one.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.634
Doesn't even make sense.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.336
Listen,

16:44.336 --> 16:46.672
I don't want to have
a threesome with you.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.675
I never wanted
to have a threesome with you,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.144
and I will not have
a threesome with you!

16:52.511 --> 16:54.580
So quit bringing it up!

16:58.283 --> 17:00.619
I think we went
a little too far.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.755
Not as far as she wanted to go.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.089
(both giggling)

17:04.089 --> 17:06.090
Excuse me. Yes.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.160
I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing

17:08.160 --> 17:11.230
and as a fellow
nontraditional sex enthusiast--

17:11.230 --> 17:12.564
our day will come.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.333
Here's my card.

17:16.402 --> 17:17.403
Thank you.

17:18.837 --> 17:20.906
Oh, and by the way,
a bunch of us get together

17:21.406 --> 17:23.909
over at the SeaTac Hyatt
second Saturday of every month,

17:24.410 --> 17:25.877
and if you want
to just tape your wife

17:26.412 --> 17:27.980
with another dude, that's cool

17:40.459 --> 17:42.361
Thank you, Mrs. Richman.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.163
And for anyone
who needs reminding

17:44.163 --> 17:50.035
these meetings start
at 8:00, not 8:07.

17:50.035 --> 17:51.804
Noted.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.972
Well, shall we open the floor up to new business?

17:53.972 --> 17:55.307
Yes! Yes! Yes!

17:55.307 --> 17:57.810
It's time you people
understood the real kind of...

17:57.810 --> 17:58.811
Hold it, Crane.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.112
I got real
business here.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.948
Can you tell us when
we're going to be able to get

18:02.948 --> 18:04.917
our cars back
into the parking garage?

18:05.451 --> 18:06.218
Oh, yeah.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.453
The lines should get

18:07.986 --> 18:09.988
their second coat tomorrow,
and if it doesn't rain

18:09.988 --> 18:12.291
it should be dry
by the end of the week.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.927
Uh-huh, and in the meantime we
have to park out on the street.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.762
Well, I know it's
a little inconvenient.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.663
Inconvenient?!

18:17.663 --> 18:18.730
I got a ticket!

18:18.730 --> 18:20.999
Yeah. My wife got towed.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.701
But after it's done,
we'll have wider parking spaces.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.136
If you make them wider

18:24.136 --> 18:25.604
aren't we going
to lose some spaces?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.873
Where are those people
supposed to go?

18:27.873 --> 18:31.143
Um, well, uh, maybe
we could take turns.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.045
Take turns?!
Take turns?!

18:33.045 --> 18:35.514
Does everybody here
need their car?

18:35.514 --> 18:36.915
Of course we
need a car.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.784
Have you got a copy of
the feasibility report?

18:39.218 --> 18:40.285
Yeah, feasibility report.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.787
Uh, yes, the, uh...
feasibility report.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.789
You only have one piece
of paper there.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.756
How long will it take

18:45.124 --> 18:47.092
before we get them
painted back the right way?

18:47.426 --> 18:47.993
And who's going to pay

18:49.561 --> 18:50.596
I had to lug my groceries

18:50.963 --> 18:51.930
three blocks!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.365
Look, I'm sorry...

18:53.365 --> 18:54.833
What? Did you
just hire a guy

18:55.267 --> 18:56.335
with a can of paint?

18:56.335 --> 18:58.137
No.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.438
People, people!

18:59.438 --> 19:02.241
If you just let him talk,
he could explain.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.543
My father is currently
in negotiations

19:04.543 --> 19:07.546
with a salvage company
to remove the old boiler room,

19:07.546 --> 19:10.382
which would give us
the extra spaces we need.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.284
Where are we going
to park in the meantime?

19:12.284 --> 19:14.353
My father has already discussed
with the building next door

19:14.853 --> 19:16.855
sharing their parking spaces.

19:16.855 --> 19:17.789
Isn't that right, Dad?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.692
Uh... Yeah. Right.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.996
We should have
had more faith in you.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.431
You've had a lot
of good ideas so far.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.501
Well, actually, I've got
something to tell you

19:29.501 --> 19:31.236
about those good ideas.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.304
Dad.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.106
All that
good stuff...

19:34.106 --> 19:36.175
all the stuff
you were crazy about...

19:36.175 --> 19:37.643
it all came from Frasier.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.178
From the very beginning,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.180
he's been the one
running things,

19:41.180 --> 19:43.682
and I think we should
give him a little credit.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.019
Well, thank you, Dad,
that's very kind of you.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.620
In fact, uh...

19:48.620 --> 19:50.189
having me run
was Frasier's idea.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
He figured that

19:51.690 --> 19:54.193
he figured that you'd go for his policies

19:54.193 --> 19:56.495
if they came from somebody else.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.297
So this whole thing was a scam.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.698
Well, I wouldn't call it a scam.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.066
It was just a fake-out

20:01.066 --> 20:03.368
Frasier, how could you
do your father like this?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.270
He's always wanted to be president,

20:05.270 --> 20:08.273
but I never thought
he would stoop this low

20:08.273 --> 20:10.576
All right, that's enough!

20:10.576 --> 20:11.877
My son is the best thing

20:11.877 --> 20:13.912
that ever happened
to this condo board,

20:13.912 --> 20:15.881
but you guys
are too petty to see it.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.950
Well, you people don't deserve him

20:17.950 --> 20:21.220
and if you don't want
him, you don't get me either.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.221
I resign.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.488
Come on, Fras.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.225
Right behind you, Dad.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.460
Now what do we do?

20:28.460 --> 20:31.196
Well, technically,
when the president resigns

20:31.196 --> 20:35.901
the runner
-up takes power.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.474
That's right, isn't it?

20:42.975 --> 20:44.476
Well.

20:44.476 --> 20:48.947
It's not the way I would hav
liked it, but bylaws are bylaws.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.882
So, as your president

20:50.882 --> 20:53.385
I would like to quote a man

20:53.385 --> 20:56.888
who understands
the language of the people.
