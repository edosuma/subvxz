WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:04.485
Oh, dear.

00:04.486 --> 00:06.486
Penny, have you been
recording shows

00:06.488 --> 00:08.321
on our DVR again?
No.

00:08.323 --> 00:10.991
Answer honestly.
This is not a trial.

00:12.393 --> 00:14.244
That'll come later.

00:14.246 --> 00:16.513
Absolutely not.

00:16.515 --> 00:18.615
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

00:18.617 --> 00:19.599
Yeah.

00:19.601 --> 00:22.452
Uh... maybe we were hacked.

00:22.454 --> 00:25.488
You know, the Chinese have been
hacking everything lately.

00:25.490 --> 00:30.744
Why would the Chinese make our
DVR record <i>Paul Blart: Mall Cop?</i>

00:32.797 --> 00:34.247
I don't know.

00:34.249 --> 00:37.283
It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.

00:37.285 --> 00:39.052
I'm deleting it.

00:39.054 --> 00:40.420
Well, hang on.

00:40.422 --> 00:43.256
Maybe the Chinese haven't
finished watching it yet.

00:44.692 --> 00:46.977
You know, if you're trying
to make space on the DVR,

00:46.979 --> 00:48.311
why don't you just get rid of

00:48.313 --> 00:49.813
some of the stuff
you've already watched?

00:49.815 --> 00:51.464
Like, um... <i>Alphas.</i>

00:51.466 --> 00:53.316
No, that's
the season two finale.

00:53.318 --> 00:54.651
That was quite the cliffhanger.

00:54.653 --> 00:56.803
I'm going to re-watch it
before season three starts.

00:56.805 --> 00:58.972
There is no season three.
They canceled that show.

01:02.660 --> 01:03.994
Well, they can't cancel it.

01:03.996 --> 01:05.779
It ended on a cliffhanger.

01:06.547 --> 01:08.248
They did.
PENNY: Uh, Sheldon,

01:08.250 --> 01:09.816
there are two dumplings left.
Do you want them?

01:09.818 --> 01:11.150
Dumplings?

01:11.152 --> 01:13.153
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

01:13.155 --> 01:15.154
As a rule, no.

01:15.156 --> 01:18.408
That show ended with all
the residents of New York

01:18.410 --> 01:19.876
either dead or unconscious.

01:19.878 --> 01:22.512
Now I'll never know
what happened.

01:22.514 --> 01:24.597
Well, why don't you
make up your own ending?

01:24.599 --> 01:27.000
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea.

01:27.002 --> 01:28.184
And after that,

01:28.186 --> 01:30.220
I'll make up my own rules
of oral hygiene.

01:30.222 --> 01:32.639
You know, instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

01:32.641 --> 01:35.025
I'm going to get the number
of the SyFy Channel

01:35.027 --> 01:36.776
and give them what for.

01:36.778 --> 01:38.061
Oh, please, don't do that.

01:38.063 --> 01:40.680
No. They can't just cancel
a show like <i>Alphas.</i>

01:40.682 --> 01:43.066
You know? They have to help
the viewers let go.

01:43.068 --> 01:46.069
<i>Firefly</i> did a movie
to wrap things up.

01:46.071 --> 01:49.072
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>
continued on as a comic book.

01:49.074 --> 01:52.459
<i>Heroes</i> gradually lowered
the quality season by season

01:52.461 --> 01:54.294
till we were grateful it ended.

01:54.296 --> 01:57.147
I feel bad for whoever
gets that phone call.

01:57.149 --> 01:58.465
Ah, don't.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.767
If they didn't want to be
yelled at by crazy nerds,

02:00.769 --> 02:02.529
they shouldn't have started
a sci-fi channel.

02:33.375 --> 02:34.767
I think you're gonna
be really happy

02:34.768 --> 02:35.768
with this security camera.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.253
The optics are great,

02:37.255 --> 02:38.638
it's got infrared technology,

02:38.640 --> 02:39.989
and there's even

02:39.991 --> 02:41.641
a backup battery
when the power goes out.

02:41.643 --> 02:42.792
Whatever.

02:42.794 --> 02:44.227
I can see my little princess

02:44.229 --> 02:46.396
while I'm at work, right?

02:46.398 --> 02:50.132
Why can't you just watch porn
like a regular guy?

02:51.785 --> 02:54.821
I need your laptop so I can
configure the software.

02:54.823 --> 02:55.905
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Wait, hold on.

02:55.907 --> 02:57.473
This is weird.

02:57.475 --> 02:58.658
What?

02:58.660 --> 02:59.993
I was Googling that girl
I've been dating,

02:59.995 --> 03:01.644
and I found her blog.

03:01.646 --> 03:02.829
Cool.

03:02.831 --> 03:04.080
Anything juicy?

03:04.082 --> 03:05.915
She said she recently
went on a date

03:05.917 --> 03:07.350
with a guy named Roger?

03:09.169 --> 03:11.120
And he's Indian?

03:12.172 --> 03:14.290
And he's an astrophysicist, too?

03:16.877 --> 03:19.043
You know what's going on,
don't you?

03:19.044 --> 03:19.509
Yes.

03:19.514 --> 03:20.763
Mummy was right.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.516
American girls are
sexually voracious devils.

03:23.518 --> 03:25.885
I can't believe
I have to explain this.

03:25.887 --> 03:29.355
People change names on blogs
to protect their privacy.

03:29.357 --> 03:32.007
Roger is Raj.

03:32.009 --> 03:33.559
Oh.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.511
I always thought,
if I had a white name,

03:35.513 --> 03:37.680
it would be Gavin.

03:39.366 --> 03:41.067
Keep reading.
What does it say?

03:41.069 --> 03:42.618
No, no, I don't know
if I should.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.354
If she wanted me to know about
her blog, she would've told me.

03:45.356 --> 03:46.739
It's almost like
I'm reading her diary.

03:46.741 --> 03:49.325
That's exactly what it's like.
Keep reading.

03:49.327 --> 03:51.544
No, this is creepy.

03:51.546 --> 03:54.047
Oh, I think we were looking
at creepy in the rearview mirror

03:54.049 --> 03:56.916
when I put up that camera.

03:56.918 --> 04:00.586
It's not creepy.
Don't listen to him.

04:00.588 --> 04:04.924
Oh, look who's got
the sweetest kisses.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:13.016 --> 04:14.684
Should I go?

04:20.324 --> 04:22.057
With all the TV Sheldon
was talking about,

04:22.059 --> 04:23.893
I had the greatest idea ever.

04:23.895 --> 04:25.495
It even blows away my idea

04:25.497 --> 04:28.247
for a <i>Star Wars</i> themed coffee
shop called "Brewbacca's."

04:29.750 --> 04:32.234
You need to watch
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</i>

04:32.236 --> 04:34.420
It is the perfect show
for the two of us.

04:34.422 --> 04:36.122
It's got action and jokes

04:36.124 --> 04:38.708
and hot vampires and romance.
I cannot oversell this!

04:38.710 --> 04:40.242
What do you say?

04:40.244 --> 04:43.245
It's 6:30 in the morning.

04:45.081 --> 04:47.216
I thought you
grew up on a farm.

04:50.387 --> 04:52.889
Hello, SyFy Network?

04:52.891 --> 04:55.975
Yeah, this is your
vice president of programming.

04:55.977 --> 04:59.278
Now, we have made a horrible
mistake regarding <i>Alphas.</i>

04:59.280 --> 05:02.381
Yeah, we need to uncancel it
immediately.

05:02.383 --> 05:04.867
Well, you just put me through
to the people who handle that,

05:04.869 --> 05:06.101
you tell them it's me,

05:06.103 --> 05:07.954
and I don't want to answer
a lot of questions

05:07.956 --> 05:10.272
about if I really am
who I say I am, you know?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.242
I just... I want this done.

05:13.244 --> 05:16.129
No, I am not the person
who just called.

05:18.215 --> 05:21.083
That man was clearly a cowboy.

05:21.085 --> 05:22.385
Yeah, who was plumb concerned

05:22.387 --> 05:23.953
about y'all canceling
his favorite show.

05:25.472 --> 05:28.674
Why do they keep
hanging up on me?

05:28.676 --> 05:30.059
I'm sorry you're upset.

05:30.061 --> 05:33.796
You know, Sheldon, sometimes
people seek the comfort

05:33.798 --> 05:36.265
of physical contact
in moments like this.

05:40.821 --> 05:42.855
I am not flying
back to Texas

05:42.857 --> 05:45.291
just so my mom
can give me a hug.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.994
Okay.

05:47.996 --> 05:50.329
Well, what I think
is going on here

05:50.331 --> 05:53.082
is you have a pathological
need for closure.

05:53.084 --> 05:55.251
Oh, that's nonsense.

05:55.253 --> 05:58.037
I mean, you tell me stories
about your day all the time.

05:58.039 --> 05:59.622
I don't care how they end.

06:01.258 --> 06:03.593
You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

06:03.595 --> 06:06.429
There's a whole field
of behavioral neuroscience

06:06.431 --> 06:09.164
that examines ways to retrain
your neural pathways

06:09.166 --> 06:11.217
so stuff like this
bothers you less.

06:11.219 --> 06:12.552
Yeah, but I just told you,

06:12.554 --> 06:14.187
I don't have a problem
with closure.

06:14.189 --> 06:15.688
You sure about that?

06:15.690 --> 06:16.973
Oh, quite sure.

06:16.975 --> 06:19.609
(knocks "Shave and a Haircut")

06:29.269 --> 06:30.453
That proves nothing.

06:33.824 --> 06:35.041
Ready to go to lunch?

06:35.043 --> 06:37.009
Do you think I'm feminine?

06:38.145 --> 06:39.662
Yeah. Let's go.

06:40.714 --> 06:41.881
Thanks a lot.

06:41.883 --> 06:42.932
What's going on?

06:42.934 --> 06:44.033
(sighs)

06:44.035 --> 06:46.035
I broke down,
and I read Lucy's blog.

06:46.037 --> 06:47.202
And in one
of the entries,

06:47.204 --> 06:48.704
she said, when we first met,

06:48.706 --> 06:50.339
I struck her
as a little feminine.

06:50.341 --> 06:52.041
Just a little?

06:52.043 --> 06:53.593
That's great.

06:53.595 --> 06:56.062
I have to talk to her
about this.

06:56.064 --> 06:57.396
Oh, geez, why do you girls

06:57.398 --> 06:59.048
always want to talk
about things?

07:00.017 --> 07:01.234
Listen to me,

07:01.236 --> 07:02.618
if she's writing
about your relationship,

07:02.620 --> 07:04.237
use it to your advantage.

07:04.239 --> 07:05.738
Rig the game.

07:05.740 --> 07:07.490
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

07:07.492 --> 07:09.892
Is it fair that girls
like confident, normal guys

07:09.894 --> 07:12.245
more than nervous weirdos?

07:12.247 --> 07:13.496
No, it's not.

07:13.498 --> 07:14.898
I've always thought
that was unfair.

07:16.066 --> 07:17.934
So take what's
in that blog

07:17.936 --> 07:20.336
and use it to get
her pants off.

07:20.338 --> 07:22.738
Why do you have to make
everything so filthy?

07:22.740 --> 07:24.590
Why couldn't you just say
the blog is like

07:24.592 --> 07:26.375
her giving me
the key to her heart?

07:26.377 --> 07:28.344
"The key to her heart."

07:28.346 --> 07:29.912
That's nice.

07:29.914 --> 07:30.963
Were you quoting someone

07:30.965 --> 07:33.415
or is it tattooed
on the small of your back?

07:33.417 --> 07:35.417
I was quoting a man

07:35.419 --> 07:37.553
who knows a thing or two
about women:

07:37.555 --> 07:39.438
Sir Elton John.

07:44.027 --> 07:46.162
(music playing over TV)

07:48.098 --> 07:49.598
So, did you love it?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.200
Of course you loved it.
How could you not love it?

07:51.202 --> 07:53.653
Tell me how much you loved it.

07:53.655 --> 07:55.104
It was cute.

07:57.424 --> 07:59.441
Oh, don't say cute.

07:59.443 --> 08:00.459
That's the worst.

08:00.461 --> 08:01.610
W's wrong with cute?

08:01.612 --> 08:03.629
It just makes things seem small.

08:03.631 --> 08:05.081
It diminishes them.

08:05.083 --> 08:08.551
So you want me to stop calling
your little tushy cute?

08:08.553 --> 08:11.120
You can try,
but nobody's gonna believe you.

08:13.974 --> 08:16.458
I just... I don't understand how
you can watch a show that great

08:16.460 --> 08:17.977
and not be excited by it.

08:17.979 --> 08:19.645
I liked it. I'm excited.

08:19.647 --> 08:21.814
Well, then, tell your face.

08:22.666 --> 08:24.266
What do you want from me?

08:24.268 --> 08:25.301
You know what?

08:25.303 --> 08:27.019
Never mind.
We gave it a shot.

08:27.021 --> 08:28.471
Let's just see
what else is on.

08:28.473 --> 08:30.570
Oh, come on,
don't be like that.

08:30.595 --> 08:31.241
Well...

08:31.242 --> 08:32.525
I'm sorry I called it cute.

08:32.527 --> 08:34.308
Let's watch another one.
Really?

08:34.311 --> 08:35.328
Yeah, it was fun.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.279
Kind of reminded me
of my high school.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.982
But instead of vampires,
we had meth heads.

08:39.984 --> 08:41.583
(clears throat)

08:41.586 --> 08:45.304
But both came out at night
and had messed up teeth.

08:45.306 --> 08:46.756
All right, cool.

08:46.758 --> 08:48.424
I-I think you'll like
the next one better.

08:48.426 --> 08:50.876
All the cheerleaders are
suffering from an evil curse.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.879
Oh. Well, that's like
my high school, too.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.749
But instead of a curse,
it was crabs. (laughs)

08:59.002 --> 09:01.637
I've come up with
a series of exercises

09:01.639 --> 09:03.856
to help with your
compulsive need for closure.

09:03.858 --> 09:07.176
I take issue with
the word "compulsive."

09:08.362 --> 09:09.845
All I'm saying is,

09:09.847 --> 09:13.015
we live in a world where
closure isn't always an op...

09:24.611 --> 09:26.379
...tion. Okay.

09:27.881 --> 09:31.083
For the sake of argument,
let's say I have a problem.

09:31.085 --> 09:33.335
What would be your plan
for addressing it?

09:33.337 --> 09:35.971
I'm going to recondition
your brain

09:35.973 --> 09:40.209
so that the need for completion
isn't so overwhelming.

09:42.378 --> 09:43.545
By playing tic-tac-toe?

09:43.547 --> 09:45.714
Yep. Your turn.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.817
Oh, Amy.

09:47.819 --> 09:49.902
And you wonder why people
think neuroscience

09:49.904 --> 09:52.188
is nothing but a goofy game
for diaper babies.

09:53.223 --> 09:57.276
Tic-tac-toe can only end
in win, lose or draw...

09:57.278 --> 10:00.496
none of which will
deny me closure.

10:00.498 --> 10:02.231
Especially since
I'm about to win.

10:13.376 --> 10:14.877
B-But we didn't finish.

10:14.879 --> 10:16.629
Exactly.

10:16.631 --> 10:18.247
How does that make you feel?

10:19.933 --> 10:21.801
The same way any
normal person would.

10:21.803 --> 10:24.437
Feel like I want to
peel off my own face

10:24.439 --> 10:26.555
and tear it in two
and then again and again

10:26.557 --> 10:28.607
until I have a handful
of Sheldon-face confetti.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.777
And that's exactly the feeling
we want to address

10:31.779 --> 10:32.895
with this course of treatment.

10:32.897 --> 10:34.864
Yeah, or you could pitch in,
grab a nostril

10:34.866 --> 10:36.949
and help me get this face off.

10:36.951 --> 10:39.101
Come on, you can do this.

10:39.103 --> 10:41.871
You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

10:41.873 --> 10:43.205
To have a-a desire

10:43.207 --> 10:45.107
build up within you
and be denied

10:45.109 --> 10:47.710
any opportunity for release.

10:55.118 --> 10:56.802
Yeah, sounds like a drag.

11:06.568 --> 11:08.736
(music playing over TV)

11:10.689 --> 11:12.490
(music stops)

11:12.492 --> 11:14.025
Okay, help me out here.

11:14.027 --> 11:15.876
Why does he love
this show so much?

11:15.878 --> 11:18.296
Well, there was action,
it was funny.

11:18.298 --> 11:19.914
I mean, you do get

11:19.916 --> 11:22.550
that usually the monster
chases the pretty girl,

11:22.552 --> 11:25.403
but this time the pretty girl
chases the monsters?

11:26.772 --> 11:28.572
Yippee, it's backwards.

11:28.574 --> 11:30.424
I get it.

11:30.426 --> 11:33.010
Why does this
bother you so much?

11:33.012 --> 11:34.729
I don't know.

11:34.731 --> 11:37.064
It's just, he's so passionate
about so many different things.

11:37.066 --> 11:38.549
I just don't get that way.

11:38.551 --> 11:39.817
Do you?

11:39.819 --> 11:42.653
Well, sure. I'm pretty
passionate about science.

11:42.655 --> 11:45.272
I remember the first time
I looked through a microscope

11:45.274 --> 11:47.692
and saw millions
of tiny microorganisms.

11:47.694 --> 11:50.027
It was like
a whole other universe.

11:50.029 --> 11:54.665
If I wanted to, I could wipe
it out with my thumb like a god.

11:55.884 --> 11:58.619
See? I wish I had some
of that fire in my life.

11:58.621 --> 12:00.538
I mean, I want
to care about things

12:00.540 --> 12:02.123
and get excited
like you guys.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.507
Well, there's no
reason you can't.

12:03.509 --> 12:04.675
You think?

12:04.677 --> 12:06.661
Absolutely.
All we need to do is spend

12:06.663 --> 12:09.263
a little time and find something
you're passionate about.

12:09.265 --> 12:12.967
(groans) That sounds
like a lot of work.

12:17.389 --> 12:18.806
Hey, what's up?

12:18.808 --> 12:20.941
Uh, Lucy's coming over.
I need some advice.

12:20.943 --> 12:25.830
However long you think the
foreplay should be, triple it.

12:26.965 --> 12:29.867
Just tell me which one you think
is more manly.

12:29.869 --> 12:32.987
This hockey jersey or...

12:32.989 --> 12:34.705
this football jersey.

12:34.707 --> 12:38.242
I don't know. Go with hockey.

12:38.244 --> 12:40.628
Good-- black is more slimming.

12:40.630 --> 12:42.229
(knocking)

12:42.231 --> 12:43.464
Oh, that's her.

12:43.466 --> 12:46.000
I got to go be butch.
Toodles.

12:50.789 --> 12:52.390
Hey.
Hi.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.341
Come in.

12:54.343 --> 12:56.844
Oh, look how cute
your little doggy is.

12:56.846 --> 12:58.846
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't get too close.

12:58.848 --> 13:00.598
If I give the right command
in German,

13:00.600 --> 13:02.066
she'll rip your face off.

13:06.688 --> 13:11.075
♪ O'er the land
of the free ♪

13:11.077 --> 13:13.661
♪ And the home

13:13.663 --> 13:16.113
♪ Of the...

13:16.115 --> 13:17.915
Next.

13:22.204 --> 13:24.238
That's quite an impressive
layout, isn't it?

13:26.491 --> 13:28.092
Yes.

13:30.879 --> 13:32.713
Let's box it up.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.383
(mocking):
"Let's box it up."

13:39.855 --> 13:42.506
("Pop! Goes the Weasel" playing)

13:45.944 --> 13:47.361
That's enough.

13:48.346 --> 13:50.481
Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!

13:50.483 --> 13:52.283
(both yell)

13:53.385 --> 13:56.804
Okay, Sheldon, make a wish
and blow out the candles.

14:02.661 --> 14:04.378
Oops, missed one.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.464
Now your wish can't come true.

14:08.867 --> 14:11.719
Lucky for you,
'cause I wished you were dead.

14:15.924 --> 14:17.391
I like your jersey.

14:17.393 --> 14:19.093
Thanks. I love hockey.

14:19.095 --> 14:20.711
Oh, cool. So does my dad.

14:20.713 --> 14:22.680
We watched it
all the time growing up.

14:22.682 --> 14:24.398
Who's your favorite player?

14:29.070 --> 14:32.907
Not Brian Boitano,
that's for sure.

14:34.509 --> 14:35.776
How's your burrito?

14:35.778 --> 14:38.362
It's still a little frozen
in the middle.

14:38.364 --> 14:40.080
Probably because I didn't read
the instructions.

14:40.082 --> 14:43.250
No wrapper's
going to tell me what to do.

14:43.252 --> 14:46.003
Unless his name is Jay-Z.

14:46.005 --> 14:47.755
Is something going on?

14:47.757 --> 14:48.856
What do you mean?

14:48.858 --> 14:50.591
Well, you're acting all weird.

14:50.593 --> 14:52.009
And I'm pretty weird,

14:52.011 --> 14:54.628
so I think I know
what I'm talking about.

14:54.630 --> 14:58.849
I don't know. Maybe it's all
those steroids I've been taking.

14:58.851 --> 15:01.018
I think I'm gonna go.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.470
Thank you for the burrito
and the pork rinds

15:03.472 --> 15:04.922
and the 20-minute lecture

15:04.924 --> 15:08.359
on why monster trucks
are better than regular trucks.

15:08.361 --> 15:10.027
Wait, wait.

15:11.262 --> 15:14.615
I-I found your blog
where you wrote about me.

15:14.617 --> 15:17.868
Oh. I kind of just write that
for myself.

15:17.870 --> 15:19.653
I didn't think anybody
actually read it.

15:19.655 --> 15:21.906
No kidding. You didn't make it
easy to find.

15:21.908 --> 15:23.707
I spent hours
digging around online.

15:25.043 --> 15:26.963
For the record, you have
excellent credit scores.

15:27.712 --> 15:29.213
And your diabetic aunt seems

15:29.215 --> 15:32.049
to be adjusting
to her new leg just fine.

15:33.117 --> 15:35.502
Why were you acting
so strange tonight?

15:35.504 --> 15:37.755
You called me feminine.

15:37.757 --> 15:38.806
And I...

15:38.808 --> 15:41.675
I wanted you to think
I was more manly.

15:41.677 --> 15:44.645
Raj, I didn't say "feminine"
was a bad thing.

15:44.647 --> 15:46.730
I meant that you're sweet
and thoughtful

15:46.732 --> 15:48.766
and your skin looks so much
like caramel,

15:48.768 --> 15:51.301
I just want to dip
an apple in your face.

15:51.303 --> 15:53.904
I do have a pretty
balls-to-the-wall

15:53.906 --> 15:56.657
moisturizing regimen.

15:56.659 --> 15:58.826
So, are you okay?

15:58.828 --> 16:00.361
Yeah.

16:00.363 --> 16:02.145
Good.

16:02.147 --> 16:03.414
Do you even like hockey?

16:03.416 --> 16:04.832
(snickers) No.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.149
Bought this
at the Staples Center

16:06.151 --> 16:07.868
when I went
to see Taylor Swift.

16:11.623 --> 16:14.625
So, I was thinking
how excited you get

16:14.627 --> 16:17.044
about stuff like <i>Buffy</i>
or science

16:17.046 --> 16:19.880
or which TV remote
you and Sheldon should buy.

16:19.882 --> 16:21.098
The "Harmony One" was fine.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.967
We didn't need to upgrade
to the 1100,

16:22.969 --> 16:26.270
which he knows
is too big for my hand.

16:26.272 --> 16:29.607
See, that's the kind of passion
I didn't think I had.

16:29.609 --> 16:32.192
But then I realized
I'm passionate about you.

16:32.194 --> 16:36.864
Oh... my cute little tushy
strikes again.

16:37.782 --> 16:39.733
No, I'm serious.

16:39.735 --> 16:42.119
Look, I've always had
these plans.

16:42.121 --> 16:44.855
I was gonna be in movies
and live this glamorous life,

16:44.857 --> 16:46.240
and anything less than that

16:46.242 --> 16:47.708
just wasn't worth
getting excited about.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.827
Those things can still happen.

16:49.829 --> 16:50.995
Oh, obviously it's gonna happen.

16:50.997 --> 16:53.363
Yeah, a psychic at a
bachelorette party told me so.

16:53.365 --> 16:56.133
Anyway, what I meant was...

16:56.135 --> 16:58.702
I shouldn't wait, you know?

16:58.704 --> 17:03.724
I've got you, I've got Sheldon,
all these wonderful friends.

17:03.726 --> 17:06.143
My life is exciting right now.

17:06.145 --> 17:08.395
That's a big deal.

17:08.396 --> 17:11.482
It is, isn't it? (chuckles)

17:12.983 --> 17:15.234
So, does that mean
we get to do stuff

17:15.237 --> 17:18.888
like talk about cool shows
or get dressed up

17:18.891 --> 17:21.925
in matching costumes
and go to Comic-Con?

17:21.926 --> 17:26.229
Leonard, I had an epiphany,
not a stroke.

17:29.167 --> 17:31.952
Amy, I must say,
I was skeptical at first,

17:31.954 --> 17:35.589
but this has truly been
a transformative evening.

17:35.591 --> 17:38.408
I'm a little surprised to hear
you feeling so positive.

17:38.410 --> 17:40.961
Well, you're an excellent
neuroscientist,

17:40.963 --> 17:44.798
you're a wonderful
girlfriend, and...

17:47.369 --> 17:48.552
And?

17:48.554 --> 17:51.421
Doesn't matter, does it?

17:51.423 --> 17:53.891
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

17:57.261 --> 17:59.596
And a complete sucker.

18:04.152 --> 18:06.103
Oh, yeah.

18:13.561 --> 18:15.429
There he is.

18:18.666 --> 18:22.970
♪ And the home of the brave...

18:22.972 --> 18:25.472
(hits high, off-key note)

18:28.209 --> 18:30.711
Don't stop. Yes, keep going.

18:30.713 --> 18:33.347
Just like that.
Almost there, almost there.

18:33.349 --> 18:35.916
(sighs)

18:38.319 --> 18:39.720
Sheldon, you big weirdo,

18:39.722 --> 18:42.756
I want you to know that I love
that you're in my life.

18:42.758 --> 18:45.592
I love you, too.

18:56.674 --> 18:59.456
Hello. Uh, is this
the Bruce Miller who wrote

18:59.457 --> 19:02.523
the season finale of <i>Alphas?</i>

19:02.525 --> 19:05.359
Oh, smashing.
Yeah, you already sound nicer

19:05.361 --> 19:07.395
than the last Bruce Miller
who suggested

19:07.397 --> 19:10.281
I have sexual relations
with myself.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.765
Yeah, now, down to business.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.484
Um, your show ended
on a cliffhanger.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.422
Could you please tell me
how you planned to resolve it?

19:17.424 --> 19:19.540
Uh-huh.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.109
Mm-hmm.

19:21.111 --> 19:22.460
I see.

19:23.335 --> 19:24.617
Well, that all stinks.

19:24.619 --> 19:26.252
No wonder you got canceled.
Bye.
