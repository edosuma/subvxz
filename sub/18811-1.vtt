01:08.251 --> 01:12.209
What we really need is
universal welfare.

01:12.334 --> 01:13.626
I agree.

01:19.292 --> 01:21.334
I think that old man's hurt.

01:21.459 --> 01:23.459
Shouldn't we help?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.251
- Check him out.
- OK.

01:26.792 --> 01:28.126
Sir! Sir! Are you...?

01:28.251 --> 01:30.584
What a stench!

01:33.501 --> 01:35.667
What? What is it?

01:35.792 --> 01:37.084
He's a homeless guy.

01:37.209 --> 01:39.084
Really?

01:39.209 --> 01:41.501
I was gonna help him
if he was hurt.

02:32.376 --> 02:34.917
Hey, got any water?

02:37.209 --> 02:38.626
Ki-woong!

02:40.251 --> 02:41.751
Are you in the...?

02:43.417 --> 02:44.917
Where is he?

02:47.751 --> 02:51.501
Why's he always leaving
without telling me?

03:04.084 --> 03:06.042
INN

03:07.917 --> 03:09.584
Where are you off to?

03:09.709 --> 03:12.626
Where's the overdue rent?
It's been days!

03:12.751 --> 03:15.917
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Sorry, my ass.

03:16.042 --> 03:18.626
My friend's getting paid today,

03:18.751 --> 03:20.792
so just until tonight, OK?

03:20.917 --> 03:22.042
Just one day.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.834
You've said that for days!

03:24.959 --> 03:28.542
If you don't pay today,
you'll find your stuff in the rubbish!

03:28.667 --> 03:31.167
So tell your boyfriend! Got it?

03:31.667 --> 03:33.709
Yeah, I got it.

03:33.834 --> 03:34.876
I'm sorry.

03:35.001 --> 03:36.334
All talk...

03:36.959 --> 03:39.376
Where's that bastard?

03:39.501 --> 03:42.626
So young and disrespectful.

03:57.626 --> 04:00.501
Honey, I washed myself for once.

04:00.626 --> 04:03.459
- You did?
- I'll give it to you cheap.

04:03.584 --> 04:06.251
- Got $3?
- No, no.

04:06.376 --> 04:10.126
I built 80%
of the buildings in Seoul.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.251
- What?
- I built them.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.167
You bastard!

04:22.292 --> 04:25.834
Asshole, I'll throw this at you!

04:25.959 --> 04:28.584
I'll throw this!
This is a grenade!

04:28.709 --> 04:31.876
You know shit about a tyrant's end!

04:32.459 --> 04:34.709
What are you staring at,
you bald rat?

04:34.834 --> 04:37.209
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, hey!

04:37.334 --> 04:39.084
- No, watch it.
- Don't cause a scene.

04:39.209 --> 04:41.167
I'm not, it's that bastard!

04:41.292 --> 04:43.751
- He's a tyrant!
- Stop it!

04:43.876 --> 04:44.959
Go away!

04:45.876 --> 04:47.834
Go somewhere else!

04:47.959 --> 04:51.376
- Go! Go!
- Come on, bro...

04:51.501 --> 04:53.417
It's too early for this.

05:05.167 --> 05:07.292
That damn tyrant...

05:07.751 --> 05:12.084
So annoying!
He ruined my day!

05:12.209 --> 05:14.792
I saw that asshole today.

05:14.917 --> 05:17.667
Why are you already lying down?

05:19.626 --> 05:22.334
What's all this?
Is it blood?

05:22.459 --> 05:27.751
What happened, bro?
Did something bite you?

05:27.876 --> 05:31.667
Oh no, this is bad. Real bad.

05:32.876 --> 05:36.001
What should I do?

05:36.709 --> 05:39.709
SHELTER

05:46.667 --> 05:50.084
- Sir, is something wrong?
- It's terrible!

05:50.209 --> 05:53.751
My bro is really sick.

05:54.292 --> 05:56.834
Blood, pouring blood, I mean.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.459
Anyway, he needs help.

05:59.584 --> 06:03.251
Where is he hurt?
Do you know?

06:03.376 --> 06:06.209
What I'm saying is,
he's got blood here.

06:06.334 --> 06:08.126
He's bleeding a lot
from the neck?

06:08.251 --> 06:10.792
It's like he's been bitten
by something.

06:13.417 --> 06:16.084
We've got a full house tonight.

06:16.667 --> 06:21.792
Some people are feeling better,
so I'll ask them to offer their beds.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.626
Please come inside.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.292
Thank you, thank you so much!

06:26.417 --> 06:28.042
My bro's saved.

06:29.251 --> 06:31.959
It was so delicious,
nice and chunky too.

06:32.084 --> 06:33.292
That good?

06:33.417 --> 06:34.626
Mr Lee!

06:36.834 --> 06:39.001
Are you feeling better?

06:39.126 --> 06:41.459
Yeah, why?

06:41.584 --> 06:45.084
His companion requires
medical attention.

06:45.209 --> 06:47.417
Could you let him
take your place?

06:50.959 --> 06:53.209
I'll fetch some medicine,

06:53.334 --> 06:56.292
so kindly make your bed, please.

06:56.417 --> 07:00.126
I'll get a first-aid kit for him.
Go and bring him here.

07:00.251 --> 07:02.626
Thank you! Thank you!

07:02.751 --> 07:04.751
- Not at all.
- I'll wait here.

07:04.876 --> 07:06.584
- OK.
- Thank you.

07:07.042 --> 07:09.917
So much work today...

07:10.042 --> 07:13.251
Yo... What are you?

07:13.376 --> 07:14.709
What?

07:18.084 --> 07:20.042
Are you deaf?

07:20.167 --> 07:22.459
Well... the thing is...

07:22.584 --> 07:26.042
my brother isn't well,
he's bleeding...

07:26.167 --> 07:27.959
Which district are you from?

07:28.084 --> 07:30.667
I'll be covered in dew
thanks to you!

07:31.209 --> 07:34.834
Please!
I should've thought better.

07:35.376 --> 07:38.334
I'm sure the meds will do him good!

07:40.251 --> 07:42.959
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- Get out of here!

07:43.084 --> 07:44.501
Piss off!

07:44.626 --> 07:46.084
Dim-witted idiot.

07:46.209 --> 07:47.626
Stupid moron.

07:48.376 --> 07:50.626
This is bad.

07:50.751 --> 07:53.126
Real bad...

07:57.292 --> 07:59.126
Use the magician.

07:59.251 --> 08:01.292
- Shut the hell up.
- You need the magician.

08:10.001 --> 08:13.376
F/19, NEAR SEOUL STATION

08:17.792 --> 08:20.417
- When did you get up?
- What are you doing?

08:20.542 --> 08:23.209
Give me a minute,
I'm almost done.

08:25.292 --> 08:27.042
LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME?
CHECK OUT MY PIC.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.417
Hey! I said I wouldn't do it!

08:32.958 --> 08:34.833
Not so loud. We're in public.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.001
So embarrassing...

08:36.126 --> 08:38.167
Come outside!

08:38.292 --> 08:40.292
I'm gonna call the police!

08:40.417 --> 08:41.667
Hey! Hey!

08:41.792 --> 08:45.084
I'm so fed up! You damn idiot!

08:45.209 --> 08:47.542
Hye-sun! Hey!

08:48.542 --> 08:51.126
- Come on, you asshole!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

08:52.084 --> 08:55.417
That was so embarrassing.
What's up?

08:55.542 --> 08:59.667
The best you could do
was pimping me out?

08:59.792 --> 09:02.376
- Seriously...
- Then what?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.084
What about the rent?

09:04.209 --> 09:07.209
I don't even have money
for the internet café.

09:07.334 --> 09:09.417
Always the internet café and shit.

09:09.542 --> 09:11.792
I told you, I won't do it anymore.

09:11.917 --> 09:14.376
- Then what?
- Then what, what?

09:14.501 --> 09:17.251
Should we sleep
under the stars then?

09:17.376 --> 09:19.626
Then go to the station,
and ask the homeless

09:19.751 --> 09:24.126
if you can join the family,
they'll keep you warm.

09:24.251 --> 09:29.001
You said you were getting
a part-time job, no?

09:29.126 --> 09:33.417
Even if I work all month,
it's never enough for the rent!

09:33.542 --> 09:36.501
Because you're always
at the internet café.

09:36.626 --> 09:40.584
Hye-sun, let's just get
through this month.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.334
Always "this month" and shit!

09:43.459 --> 09:45.126
You don't have to screw 'em,

09:45.251 --> 09:48.834
just steal their money
while they're taking a shower.

09:48.959 --> 09:50.876
Then it's game over!

09:51.001 --> 09:54.042
Stop spewing bullshit!

09:54.167 --> 09:58.542
I'll find a decent job next month, OK?

09:58.667 --> 09:59.834
Exactly how?

09:59.959 --> 10:02.501
You know my friend,
the one with a big tattoo,

10:02.626 --> 10:05.251
he works as a bouncer
down South.

10:05.376 --> 10:07.626
The club with the dome,
you know.

10:07.751 --> 10:10.584
- The Korea House?
- He'll use me as a solicitor.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.542
We can be happy, Hye-sun, please!

10:15.167 --> 10:16.334
No way!

10:16.459 --> 10:19.542
I won't do it anymore! Not ever!

10:20.084 --> 10:22.501
Not do what, goddammit?

10:22.626 --> 10:26.126
Is your body so precious?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.876
Does it wear out by screwing?

10:29.001 --> 10:30.542
Answer me.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.667
Don't hit me, asshole.

10:34.709 --> 10:38.292
Fine, you're so high and mighty!

10:38.417 --> 10:40.126
Don't bother coming home.

10:40.251 --> 10:41.417
Wait...

10:41.542 --> 10:44.417
Don't you remember?

10:44.542 --> 10:47.584
You fled the brothel,
and lived off the street.

10:47.709 --> 10:51.751
Then I found you
and gave you love, hope,

10:51.876 --> 10:55.959
and all that shit,
and now you won't help me out?

10:56.876 --> 11:00.251
Hye-sun, you and I are really over!

11:00.376 --> 11:02.917
What a selfish bitch...

11:03.042 --> 11:04.042
Hey...

11:04.167 --> 11:07.501
Don't ever let me find you.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.584
Ki-woong!

11:11.292 --> 11:12.376
Hey!

11:25.792 --> 11:30.167
Dad... I'm sorry...

12:02.876 --> 12:03.876
MR HONG

12:04.001 --> 12:05.417
What now?

12:06.042 --> 12:07.917
- Hello?
- <i>Suk-kyu.</i>

12:08.042 --> 12:10.834
<i>OK to talk? How are you?</i>

12:10.959 --> 12:12.417
<i>Doing better?</i>

12:12.542 --> 12:13.917
Get to the point.

12:14.042 --> 12:17.792
<i>I wasn't sure if I should
tell you this or not...</i>

12:17.917 --> 12:20.292
I don't have time, get to the point.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.917
<i>I came across a girl online
who could be Hye-sun.</i>

12:24.501 --> 12:25.542
What?

12:26.709 --> 12:28.084
LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME?
CHECK OUT MY PIC.

12:28.209 --> 12:31.042
- What the hell?
- <i>Is it her?</i>

12:31.167 --> 12:32.292
<i>It's Hye-sun, right?</i>

12:32.417 --> 12:34.209
But how...

12:34.876 --> 12:38.209
<i>I think she's selling herself, no?</i>

12:38.334 --> 12:40.459
How do I contact her?

12:40.584 --> 12:42.751
- <i>Hey, calm down.</i>
- Hello?

12:42.876 --> 12:44.251
<i>Calm down, Suk-kyu.</i>

12:57.917 --> 13:01.126
This is bad, really bad.

13:07.792 --> 13:10.209
Buddy, get out!

13:10.667 --> 13:14.376
- Get out!
- It's bad! Terrible!

13:14.501 --> 13:16.251
It really is terrible.

13:16.376 --> 13:18.209
Your being here is terrible!
Go away!

13:18.334 --> 13:20.834
No, it's not that.

13:20.959 --> 13:24.917
My bro's bleeding
so much from his neck.

13:25.042 --> 13:29.001
If he's hurt,
go to the medical centre.

13:29.126 --> 13:30.292
Get the hell out!

13:30.417 --> 13:33.251
- It's for real!
- Get out now!

13:33.376 --> 13:35.459
I'm closing up here!

13:35.584 --> 13:37.042
Go away!

13:37.167 --> 13:38.167
It's bad...

13:40.084 --> 13:41.626
Hurry up!

13:45.917 --> 13:49.417
That stupid idiot came to me,

13:49.542 --> 13:52.334
and said,
"So high and mighty?"

13:53.709 --> 13:56.126
Which district is he from?

13:56.251 --> 13:58.709
Who cares? Drink.

13:58.834 --> 14:01.001
STATION PHARMACY

14:01.459 --> 14:04.001
Excuse me...

14:07.917 --> 14:09.501
I'm closing up, go away.

14:09.626 --> 14:13.042
I...I want to buy some painkillers.

14:13.167 --> 14:16.834
I've got money, I really do!

14:17.417 --> 14:18.667
Dammit...

14:20.084 --> 14:23.459
- Wait a moment.
- Thank you!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.501
ENERGY D

14:45.167 --> 14:46.209
Here.

14:47.001 --> 14:49.792
I'm really sorry, but...

14:50.251 --> 14:55.084
I'm short on cash.
Could I get just a few pills?

14:55.209 --> 14:58.042
And a bottle of Energy D.

14:59.334 --> 15:01.876
Dammit.

15:07.584 --> 15:11.167
Hold on, bro.
This is bad, real bad...

15:14.459 --> 15:18.917
Bro, take this first, OK?

15:25.459 --> 15:26.667
Bro?

15:29.042 --> 15:33.126
Bro!

15:33.251 --> 15:36.126
My bro is dead!

15:37.292 --> 15:39.417
He's dead!

15:41.334 --> 15:45.917
The economy's terrible,
don't even touch real estate.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.709
Sir! Sir!

15:49.834 --> 15:53.251
My bro's dead!

15:53.376 --> 16:00.501
He's dead
because you didn't listen!

16:03.542 --> 16:06.167
- Let's check it out.
- OK.

16:14.501 --> 16:17.084
- Where is he?
- There's no one here.

16:17.584 --> 16:19.959
I'm too tired for jokes!

16:22.501 --> 16:25.001
- Weird...
- Nothing weird here.

16:25.126 --> 16:26.792
Where did he go?

16:26.917 --> 16:29.834
He was here and dead
a minute ago.

16:31.001 --> 16:33.417
Wasted our time in this heat.

16:35.001 --> 16:39.084
Those homeless
are a pain in the arse.

16:39.209 --> 16:43.626
- Let's get some cold noodles.
- You had some earlier.

16:58.126 --> 17:00.126
Hello, sir!

17:00.251 --> 17:02.126
Sorry I'm late.

17:02.251 --> 17:05.251
You called earlier, right?

17:05.376 --> 17:06.876
I must apologise,

17:07.001 --> 17:10.416
she'll be a bit late,
being popular and all.

17:10.541 --> 17:14.666
There's a motel up here,
if you could wait there...

17:14.791 --> 17:16.251
Son of a bitch!

17:16.376 --> 17:17.584
Where's Hye-sun?

17:17.709 --> 17:19.584
Who... Who are you?

17:20.126 --> 17:24.334
- I'm her father!
- Father? Daddy?

18:01.417 --> 18:02.792
Bro?

18:03.501 --> 18:05.001
Bro?

18:05.459 --> 18:08.876
Where did you go?

18:14.334 --> 18:15.917
Bro?

18:16.042 --> 18:17.751
Come on...

18:21.417 --> 18:22.709
Bro!

18:29.626 --> 18:31.584
Hey!

18:37.251 --> 18:38.459
Hey, bro.

18:39.167 --> 18:42.209
You were here?
How are you feeling?

18:51.959 --> 18:54.417
What are you doing here?

19:14.376 --> 19:15.834
KI-WOONG

19:17.376 --> 19:18.792
Son of a bitch.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.459
She's not picking up.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.917
Why the hell not?

19:32.042 --> 19:36.542
If you don't find her tonight,
you're dead meat.

19:36.667 --> 19:37.792
Got it?

19:37.917 --> 19:42.751
Since she has no money,
she'll return to the inn.

19:42.876 --> 19:45.751
She could already be there,
she's like that.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.251
How much further?

19:48.751 --> 19:50.126
Almost there.

19:50.751 --> 19:53.001
There, go into that alley.

20:03.334 --> 20:06.251
Oh, yeah,
cars can't go any further.

20:06.959 --> 20:09.376
We're close.
Let's walk over there.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.209
Sir, I have to say...

20:23.334 --> 20:24.417
What is it?

20:24.542 --> 20:28.334
If it wasn't for me,
she'd be dead by now.

20:28.459 --> 20:30.834
I was sort of a guardian to her...

20:30.959 --> 20:32.542
You asshole!

20:32.667 --> 20:34.542
That makes it right, asshole?

20:34.667 --> 20:39.084
Be thankful that I don't snap
your neck right here!

20:39.209 --> 20:42.459
If anything happens to my girl,

20:42.584 --> 20:45.542
I'll break your legs, understand?

20:45.667 --> 20:48.376
Yes, I understand, please let go!

20:50.417 --> 20:52.584
Puny bastard.

20:55.751 --> 20:58.167
- I almost died...
- Lead on!

21:01.042 --> 21:05.126
INN

21:30.917 --> 21:32.917
Ma'am! What's wrong?

21:33.542 --> 21:37.042
People here are like that,
don't be startled.

21:40.501 --> 21:42.334
What the...

21:42.459 --> 21:44.167
Stop it!

21:48.292 --> 21:49.834
Hurry up, asshole.

21:51.167 --> 21:53.251
Hye-sun! Hye-sun?

21:57.001 --> 21:58.876
Not here yet.

21:59.001 --> 22:00.792
I don't think she's back yet.

22:00.917 --> 22:02.626
She'll be back soon.

22:02.751 --> 22:04.376
Wanna wait inside?

22:10.584 --> 22:12.584
She lived in this dump?

22:21.792 --> 22:25.459
Mister, please help me!

22:33.084 --> 22:34.292
What the hell?

22:39.042 --> 22:40.251
What is it?

22:40.792 --> 22:42.876
What was that?

22:46.292 --> 22:47.626
What the...?

22:47.751 --> 22:51.167
Is there a weapon? Anything?

22:51.292 --> 22:52.792
No weapons...

22:52.917 --> 22:55.042
Weapon, weapon!

22:55.167 --> 22:56.626
Come on!

22:57.292 --> 22:59.084
Who the hell is it?

22:59.751 --> 23:00.667
Don't open it!

23:04.917 --> 23:07.251
Ma'am, what's wrong with you?

23:25.459 --> 23:26.584
Dammit!

23:27.167 --> 23:29.709
Ma'am... ma'am...

23:29.834 --> 23:33.251
Sir, you killed a person.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.584
Sir, hurry! Hurry!

23:55.126 --> 23:56.709
What's wrong with those two?

24:37.667 --> 24:43.792
<i>Those staying inside the station,
quieten down, OK?</i>

24:43.917 --> 24:47.959
<i>If you continue this,
I'll call the police.</i>

24:48.084 --> 24:49.792
<i>I'll say it once more.</i>

24:49.917 --> 24:53.876
<i>Everyone, please be quiet!</i>

25:06.709 --> 25:08.959
Get away! Just run!

26:21.792 --> 26:23.251
Help!

26:27.376 --> 26:28.501
What is it?

26:30.209 --> 26:33.376
Please help us! We almost died!

26:33.501 --> 26:36.001
What's going on here?

26:36.126 --> 26:38.001
Did you get into a fight?

26:38.584 --> 26:40.709
No, it's not a fight.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.876
Everyone's gone insane!

26:45.126 --> 26:46.792
Look at you all!

26:46.917 --> 26:48.334
What a stench!

26:48.459 --> 26:49.834
Get the hell out!

26:49.959 --> 26:51.792
Listen to me!

26:51.917 --> 26:55.042
Where do you think you are?

26:55.167 --> 26:57.167
- Kick them out!
- Yes, sir.

26:57.292 --> 26:58.959
Out! Out!

27:05.084 --> 27:07.417
Jin-young! Jin-young!

27:51.876 --> 27:54.209
What... are they?

27:57.001 --> 27:58.959
Sir, what happened to them?

27:59.084 --> 28:01.376
What in the world?
We can't stay...

28:01.501 --> 28:04.167
- What are they?
- Who knows, idiot?

28:37.959 --> 28:40.126
Get your shit together
and follow me!

28:52.876 --> 28:54.126
Come on!

29:08.001 --> 29:09.501
Move your ass!

29:13.251 --> 29:16.751
Kick it! Right in the face!

29:22.501 --> 29:25.334
A bit more! Grab my hand!

29:47.126 --> 29:48.667
What on earth...?

29:53.584 --> 29:55.959
Call Hye-sun!

29:56.084 --> 29:57.751
Call her mobile now!

30:08.626 --> 30:10.959
No answer! It's turned off!

30:12.209 --> 30:13.417
Dammit!

30:13.959 --> 30:16.792
Let's get to the car first!

30:21.251 --> 30:23.251
Get your ass up!

30:28.626 --> 30:29.751
Over there!

30:31.334 --> 30:33.334
Pull yourself together!

30:33.959 --> 30:35.876
Snap out of it!

30:37.501 --> 30:38.917
Look over there!

30:39.042 --> 30:41.917
Get your shit together and look!

30:43.584 --> 30:45.334
You see that car?

30:45.459 --> 30:48.292
Get down to that roof,

30:48.417 --> 30:51.209
and lure them away from that alley.

30:51.667 --> 30:55.126
No, no, I can't!

30:55.626 --> 30:57.917
Listen carefully, asshole!

30:58.626 --> 31:00.709
Lure them by shouting.

31:00.834 --> 31:03.834
Get them to come to you,

31:03.959 --> 31:07.334
and I'll get the car
and go to the main street.

31:07.459 --> 31:11.042
Then you run through that alley
and reach the street.

31:11.626 --> 31:14.126
I'll meet you there, got it?

31:14.251 --> 31:16.626
No, I'll get killed!

31:16.751 --> 31:19.334
You have to, or we're both dead!

31:26.042 --> 31:27.459
Please...

31:46.376 --> 31:48.459
What are they?

31:55.542 --> 31:56.959
This is Seoul Station precinct!

31:57.084 --> 32:00.042
The homeless are attacking civilians!

32:00.167 --> 32:01.501
Multiple casualties!

32:01.626 --> 32:04.792
Requesting a platoon for support!

32:04.917 --> 32:07.834
I repeat,
the homeless are on a rampage.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.751
Multiple casualties,
multiple casualties!

32:10.876 --> 32:14.209
Hey! We didn't cause this!

32:14.334 --> 32:17.459
Those monsters just attacked us!

32:17.584 --> 32:20.209
Hold still, you bastards!
Sons of bitches...

32:20.334 --> 32:22.334
Don't move!

32:23.626 --> 32:25.917
Sir, I'm not a homeless person!

32:26.042 --> 32:28.209
Save me, please!

32:28.334 --> 32:30.876
- Shit!
- Please help me!

32:31.792 --> 32:33.251
You bitch!

32:33.376 --> 32:37.417
Don't move!
I'll shoot you if you do!

32:39.501 --> 32:43.376
You monsters, I'll kill you all!

32:54.876 --> 32:57.584
Be careful! Jump!

33:07.834 --> 33:08.917
Hey!

33:11.751 --> 33:12.876
Get going!

33:13.626 --> 33:15.292
Get on with it, you moron!

33:28.376 --> 33:29.626
Good, good.

34:12.667 --> 34:14.501
Keep moving!

34:21.958 --> 34:26.208
Bastard!
Watch where you're going!

34:26.333 --> 34:27.667
You got eyes, asshole?

34:27.792 --> 34:30.583
You owe me an apology!
Hey, buddy!

34:32.583 --> 34:34.001
Come back here!

34:38.251 --> 34:40.126
That stupid idiot...

34:42.333 --> 34:43.417
Dammit!

34:54.208 --> 34:56.208
Holy shit! Goddammit!

35:11.501 --> 35:14.501
Main street! Where is it?
Where?

35:15.209 --> 35:16.417
Dammit!

36:08.709 --> 36:10.042
Get in! Hurry!

36:21.917 --> 36:23.709
Sir, hurry! Let's move!

36:58.459 --> 36:59.542
Jin-young!

37:00.126 --> 37:01.584
Are you OK?

37:01.709 --> 37:02.876
Hey!

37:06.667 --> 37:07.834
Jin-young!

37:08.876 --> 37:10.084
Jin-young...

37:19.584 --> 37:22.542
So they can come back
from the dead?

37:27.751 --> 37:29.501
Don't move!

37:30.667 --> 37:32.251
Not a single step,
you bastards...

37:51.001 --> 37:53.292
Don't come any closer!

37:58.917 --> 38:00.917
You son of a bitch!

38:09.417 --> 38:10.751
Die, bastard!

38:11.334 --> 38:12.417
Die!

38:12.959 --> 38:13.917
Die!

38:19.126 --> 38:20.209
Gun...

38:20.876 --> 38:22.042
Gun?

38:26.167 --> 38:27.376
Give it to me!

38:27.959 --> 38:30.334
Wait, mister,

38:30.834 --> 38:33.626
will you let me live?

38:33.751 --> 38:35.167
Give it to me!

38:41.876 --> 38:44.376
Two shots, two left...

38:59.167 --> 39:00.792
It's all over!

39:01.584 --> 39:04.209
This is how it ends.

39:07.917 --> 39:09.376
Ki-woong...

39:09.959 --> 39:11.709
I'm in deep...

39:12.167 --> 39:15.959
I'm in so deep...
What do I do?

39:16.084 --> 39:17.501
Ki-woong...

39:36.792 --> 39:38.209
Hey, you OK?

39:39.334 --> 39:41.001
What were those?

39:41.667 --> 39:45.917
If you lived on the streets,
you must've seen some shit.

39:46.042 --> 39:47.459
Snap out of it.

39:48.876 --> 39:51.334
Have you seen those before?

39:53.876 --> 39:56.459
Let's find Hye-sun first, OK?

39:56.917 --> 39:58.292
Stay focused.

40:33.292 --> 40:36.001
It's over, all over...

40:36.626 --> 40:38.001
It hurts...

40:44.042 --> 40:45.042
What the hell?

40:45.167 --> 40:47.167
Over here!
Please save us!

41:29.126 --> 41:30.917
What's going on?

41:36.209 --> 41:38.876
Where you coming from?
Were you just inside?

41:39.334 --> 41:42.084
Are you hurt? Get inside!

41:44.292 --> 41:45.459
Get in!

41:53.501 --> 41:55.167
All right, let's go!

42:00.167 --> 42:01.751
Sir, sir!

42:01.876 --> 42:04.417
Are you OK?
Where are you hurt?

42:05.251 --> 42:07.792
What happened inside?

42:07.917 --> 42:10.626
Crazy! They're all crazy!

42:10.751 --> 42:12.876
Those crazies, all of a sudden...

42:13.334 --> 42:16.251
It's OK, sir, please stay calm.

42:16.376 --> 42:17.542
Keep breathing.

42:17.667 --> 42:21.417
Please lie down. Calm yourself.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.626
- Over here.
- OK.

42:23.751 --> 42:24.876
Breathe.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.334
Very good.

42:28.084 --> 42:29.542
Just relax.

42:29.667 --> 42:30.876
Is this your blood?

42:31.001 --> 42:32.917
21 MISSED CALLS: KI-WOONG

42:43.501 --> 42:44.542
Hye-sun!

42:46.084 --> 42:49.792
Ki-woong! I'm in trouble!

42:51.334 --> 42:54.084
Where are you?
There's trouble everywhere.

42:54.209 --> 42:56.584
Your father came to find you!

42:56.709 --> 42:59.167
What? My father?

42:59.292 --> 43:01.626
Yeah, I'm with him now.

43:03.709 --> 43:06.251
<i>Where are you?
I'll come and pick you up.</i>

43:07.417 --> 43:12.417
I'm in an ambulance,
heading for the hospital.

43:12.542 --> 43:13.584
<i>Hospital?</i>

43:14.209 --> 43:16.542
OK, we'll head that way.

43:16.667 --> 43:19.126
Keep your phone on, OK?

43:23.542 --> 43:25.751
Sir, I got a call from Hye-sun!

43:25.876 --> 43:28.417
What? Where is she now?

43:28.542 --> 43:30.542
Just get in!

43:31.001 --> 43:33.501
What the hell's going on?

43:34.417 --> 43:36.584
Sick people everywhere...

43:37.417 --> 43:38.751
Say what?

43:39.251 --> 43:43.792
We're bombarded with calls
from bite victims.

43:43.917 --> 43:45.876
We're in a state of emergency.

43:46.001 --> 43:49.209
I don't even know if we can use
the ER when we arrive.

43:49.334 --> 43:52.209
Where are all the bite victims?

43:52.876 --> 43:55.126
They're all at the ER.

43:55.251 --> 43:58.834
They must be busy,
I can't even reach them.

43:58.959 --> 44:00.667
Stop! Stop the car!

44:01.959 --> 44:03.209
Stop right now!

44:03.334 --> 44:06.292
- What for?
- They'll turn!

44:06.417 --> 44:07.667
Stop right here!

44:07.792 --> 44:10.042
We can't go there!

44:10.167 --> 44:12.834
Sir, please calm down!

44:12.959 --> 44:17.001
- Don't get worked up!
- They all went crazy!

44:18.126 --> 44:20.709
- Stop! Stop right now!
- Sir! Don't!

44:21.501 --> 44:24.167
- Sir! Stay calm!
- Let me out!

44:25.001 --> 44:27.084
- What's with you?
- It's dangerous!

44:28.042 --> 44:30.626
- Stop this damn car!
- What's the matter?

44:30.751 --> 44:32.251
What's wrong with him?

44:32.376 --> 44:36.167
- Stop! Let me out!
- Let go!

44:36.751 --> 44:40.292
- Sir, this is dangerous!
- I said stop!

44:40.792 --> 44:43.042
Grab him! Pull him off!

44:43.501 --> 44:44.584
We'll crash!

45:18.667 --> 45:20.042
You son of a bitch!

45:21.751 --> 45:22.834
Goddamn asshole!

45:25.751 --> 45:28.417
I have to flee,
escape from here.

46:06.334 --> 46:08.959
We have to leave this area.

46:42.209 --> 46:43.834
We gotta go down this way.

46:44.417 --> 46:46.417
It's down this way.

47:11.834 --> 47:14.667
Hurry! Hurry!

47:30.251 --> 47:32.542
Go through, hurry!

47:40.292 --> 47:43.834
Your turn, come on!

47:53.709 --> 47:55.251
Sir!

47:59.959 --> 48:01.251
Come on!

48:03.626 --> 48:05.709
Quickly! Quickly!

48:14.126 --> 48:15.792
You sickos!

48:15.917 --> 48:19.001
So damn loud, you damn sickos!

48:19.126 --> 48:21.126
Are you two dating?

48:22.417 --> 48:27.334
So sick of it! Everything's sick!

48:32.876 --> 48:37.001
World's going to shit,
no reason to live.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.751
Die! Just die!

48:48.834 --> 48:51.959
Mum? Where did you go?

48:52.084 --> 48:55.167
Don't leave me alone.

49:44.126 --> 49:46.126
NO SIGNAL

49:47.084 --> 49:49.251
What do I do, Ki-woong?

49:59.459 --> 50:00.709
Ki-woong...

50:28.792 --> 50:30.084
It's too quiet.

50:33.959 --> 50:35.251
Hey.

50:35.376 --> 50:37.417
- Give her a call.
- OK.

50:43.292 --> 50:44.792
Still not getting through.

50:49.376 --> 50:51.959
I'll check out the ER,

50:52.084 --> 50:55.334
so stay right here in the car, OK?

50:56.084 --> 50:58.167
Sure, I can do that.

51:08.834 --> 51:10.334
Too quiet...

51:23.334 --> 51:25.084
It's deserted...

51:33.459 --> 51:36.292
EMERGENCY ROOM

52:55.084 --> 52:58.167
Don't do it, please.

53:01.292 --> 53:02.376
Sir...

53:04.334 --> 53:06.501
Kill it, kill it!

53:13.167 --> 53:14.917
Dammit!

53:15.042 --> 53:17.042
Hurry! Get in!

53:17.167 --> 53:19.584
Drive! Drive! Go!

53:25.251 --> 53:27.751
- Sir, hurry!
- Shut the hell up!

53:46.001 --> 53:48.501
- Call her again.
- OK.

53:52.834 --> 53:54.042
Where the heck is she?

53:54.167 --> 53:56.251
<i>Your call cannot be connected...</i>

53:56.376 --> 53:57.917
No signal.

53:58.042 --> 53:59.584
Dammit!

54:09.459 --> 54:10.792
Sir...

54:12.126 --> 54:14.959
You're an adult, right?

54:17.084 --> 54:20.917
We gotta get away.
Far, far away.

54:22.126 --> 54:26.209
Sir, I want to go home.

54:27.334 --> 54:31.084
I've only met horrible people
since I ran away.

54:32.542 --> 54:38.292
The bar only piled up my debt...

54:43.876 --> 54:49.126
Ki-woong, he's my boyfriend,

54:49.876 --> 54:53.876
he and my dad are looking for me.

54:56.709 --> 55:01.126
Must go far, far, far away...

55:01.251 --> 55:05.667
Sir, I have to go home.

55:06.167 --> 55:08.459
I want to go home!

55:09.667 --> 55:10.792
Home?

55:17.667 --> 55:19.917
I want to go home too.

55:26.417 --> 55:30.417
But I don't have one!

55:41.959 --> 55:44.459
I want to go home!

55:50.542 --> 55:53.084
Daddy!

56:07.126 --> 56:08.376
What happened?

56:18.584 --> 56:21.751
Sir, how do we find her?

56:22.834 --> 56:26.626
Let's get to a vantage point.

56:26.751 --> 56:27.834
OK.

56:33.251 --> 56:35.042
Which way?

56:35.709 --> 56:37.209
I think it's this way.

56:53.876 --> 56:55.042
Over there!

56:55.167 --> 56:58.167
Almost there! We're close!

56:58.292 --> 57:00.959
There'll be people there.

57:34.001 --> 57:37.459
Must go further, much further.

58:12.084 --> 58:13.959
Oh, no! Look at that car...

58:16.876 --> 58:18.126
Over there!

58:47.167 --> 58:48.251
KI-WOONG

58:49.876 --> 58:52.667
- <i>Hye-sun!</i>
- Ki-woong!

58:52.792 --> 58:54.459
<i>Hye-sun, are you safe?</i>

58:54.584 --> 58:59.126
<i>Ki-woong, help me,
come and pick me up!</i>

58:59.251 --> 59:03.417
<i>Stay calm, OK?
Where are you?</i>

59:03.542 --> 59:04.667
I am at...

59:07.209 --> 59:11.959
Hoehyeon Station, exit 4.
Please hurry!

59:13.001 --> 59:15.709
- What is it? Where's Hoehyeon?
- Hoehyeon?

59:15.834 --> 59:17.626
Please hurry!

59:20.042 --> 59:23.126
There! Over there!
Hoehyeon Station!

59:23.834 --> 59:27.667
Hye-sun, we're coming.
Stay where you are, OK?

59:28.251 --> 59:32.084
How can I stay here?
It's dangerous here too!

59:33.167 --> 59:37.126
<i>Take shelter somewhere!</i>

59:41.251 --> 59:44.126
Hello? Hello? What's going on?

59:49.042 --> 59:51.376
Hye-sun! Hye-sun!

59:52.251 --> 59:53.376
Dammit!

01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:18.042
Hey! Over here!

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:21.709
Run! Come on! Hurry!

01:00:26.209 --> 01:00:28.001
Climb over!

01:00:28.584 --> 01:00:29.667
Hurry!

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.334
- Son of a bitch!
- Stay back!

01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:42.959
You bastards!

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.459
Hello? Ki-woong?

01:00:56.584 --> 01:00:57.626
Hello?

01:00:57.751 --> 01:01:00.709
- Hello? Hye-sun!
<i>- Please leave a message...</i>

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:09.667
It went dead.

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.126
Shit!

01:01:13.167 --> 01:01:17.292
Let's get to the station,
come on!

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:40.001
<i>You're participating
in an unlawful assembly.</i>

01:01:41.251 --> 01:01:44.626
<i>If you do not disperse,
you'll be forced to do so.</i>

01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:55.459
<i>If you do not disperse,
you'll be forced to do so.</i>

01:02:05.334 --> 01:02:07.334
It's all over.

01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:11.834
It's all going to shit.

01:02:48.334 --> 01:02:51.084
I need more troops!

01:02:51.209 --> 01:02:53.459
Just send all you got here.

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:58.501
What's going on here?

01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:07.626
We have to get to Hoehyeon.
Can't I pass through?

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:09.792
Go away, move back.

01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:11.792
Please! We have to go!

01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:13.376
Stay back!

01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:16.709
Go away,
we're in a state of emergency!

01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:20.709
Buddy! What's happening here?

01:03:20.834 --> 01:03:22.584
There are uninfected people there!

01:03:22.709 --> 01:03:26.917
It's a state of emergency!
You can't cross, so go away!

01:03:27.042 --> 01:03:28.334
- Son of a...
- Stay back!

01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:32.042
People over there could die.
Let us through!

01:03:32.167 --> 01:03:34.751
So annoying! Stay back!

01:03:34.876 --> 01:03:36.584
Why, you little...!

01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:38.459
Hey, what's going on?

01:03:38.584 --> 01:03:41.959
They're saying they need to get
to the Hoehyeon Station.

01:03:43.792 --> 01:03:44.917
What is it?

01:03:45.834 --> 01:03:49.709
Sir, my girlfriend is stuck
in the station.

01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:52.792
I have to get her.
Please let us through, OK?

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:55.459
- Just us, OK?
- Do us a favour.

01:03:56.001 --> 01:04:00.834
We have to stand by
until there's an order.

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:02.376
Just go back, OK?

01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:05.876
Are you gonna kill
all the normal people?

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:08.834
Come on, sir,
take your boy and go away!

01:04:08.959 --> 01:04:11.251
Send them away.

01:04:11.376 --> 01:04:13.792
Go away, hurry!

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:17.584
You call yourselves cops?
Incompetent idiots!

01:04:21.834 --> 01:04:22.959
What are you doing?

01:04:23.084 --> 01:04:24.751
Hold still, asshole!

01:04:24.876 --> 01:04:26.501
Let go of me!

01:04:28.876 --> 01:04:30.584
Don't move, asshole!

01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:36.792
- We're in a crisis!
- Are you OK?

01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:38.917
He's got... a gun.

01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:42.459
Hey, hey.

01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:45.459
It's OK, put your gun down.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:51.834
Listen, this isn't a normal situation.

01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:54.876
Martial law could be declared.

01:04:55.584 --> 01:05:00.834
Don't get involved.
Just go home and watch the news.

01:05:00.959 --> 01:05:02.792
Understand?

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:07.042
Go home, right now.

01:05:16.751 --> 01:05:19.167
Stay the hell back!

01:05:19.292 --> 01:05:20.834
Piss off!

01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:35.376
Frigging bitch! Stay back!

01:05:42.584 --> 01:05:44.126
You OK?

01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:49.084
He's bitten, he'll turn soon.

01:05:49.209 --> 01:05:52.959
It's just a scratch, I'm OK.

01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:59.042
Yeah, it's too small a bite, right?

01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:01.292
What do we do then?

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:03.876
I'm OK.

01:06:04.876 --> 01:06:09.584
<i>You're participating
in an unlawful assembly.</i>

01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:13.667
<i>Please disperse and head home.</i>

01:06:16.584 --> 01:06:19.542
Why isn't it working?

01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:22.501
Please...

01:06:30.084 --> 01:06:31.834
Please work...

01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:36.376
Why isn't it working?

01:07:13.126 --> 01:07:14.167
Move!

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.209
On the double!

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:24.709
Sir, what's up with those soldiers?

01:07:24.834 --> 01:07:26.667
What'll happen now?

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:28.876
Yes, sir...

01:07:29.376 --> 01:07:31.209
Capital Defence Command...

01:07:32.209 --> 01:07:34.959
...is now in full control.

01:07:48.334 --> 01:07:51.709
Move aside! Out of my way!

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.751
Shut the hell up!

01:07:55.376 --> 01:07:58.417
You bastards!
I worked for my country!

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:03.459
I'm different from you trash!
You're all useless!

01:08:05.584 --> 01:08:13.084
I don't know how I got myself
mixed up with you all!

01:08:14.126 --> 01:08:18.751
It looks like the commies
are behind this!

01:08:18.876 --> 01:08:20.417
But me?

01:08:21.459 --> 01:08:26.376
I don't deserve to die here!

01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:33.584
I dedicated my life to this country!

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:37.167
I'm a good person!

01:08:40.334 --> 01:08:44.501
I'm a good person!

01:08:44.626 --> 01:08:46.334
Out of my way!

01:08:46.834 --> 01:08:47.959
Dammit!

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.001
I'm the same too!

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:53.626
I made sacrifices for this country!

01:08:54.917 --> 01:08:57.292
So how did I end up this way?

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.126
Know why?

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:08.334
This country doesn't care about us!

01:09:08.459 --> 01:09:13.334
But we worked ourselves to death,
you fools!

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:21.292
But the thing is, I must survive!

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:23.417
I want to live!

01:09:25.876 --> 01:09:27.959
Where are you going?

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:30.584
What are you doing?

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.751
Don't go up there!

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:38.667
Get the hell away!

01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:41.292
Die!

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.292
Fuck!

01:10:07.959 --> 01:10:09.084
Where?

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:10.584
Where?

01:10:42.334 --> 01:10:43.459
Sir...

01:10:44.292 --> 01:10:45.501
Sir!

01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:51.459
If I had a place to go,

01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:55.751
I wouldn't have stayed
at Seoul Station...

01:10:59.334 --> 01:11:01.167
Sir... sir...

01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:20.834
Hurry! Hurry!

01:12:24.042 --> 01:12:26.542
A bit further, hurry!

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:27.959
Almost there!

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:30.584
Hurry! Hurry!

01:12:34.001 --> 01:12:35.084
No!

01:12:35.876 --> 01:12:38.667
Don't look down! Over here!

01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:39.959
You can do it!

01:12:41.917 --> 01:12:43.751
No! No!

01:12:46.417 --> 01:12:49.459
That's it! Just a little bit more!

01:12:49.584 --> 01:12:50.584
Quickly!

01:12:51.959 --> 01:12:53.751
Come on!

01:12:54.376 --> 01:12:55.501
A little faster!

01:12:56.584 --> 01:12:58.376
Almost there!

01:12:58.501 --> 01:13:00.084
Come on! A bit more!

01:16:31.501 --> 01:16:33.626
Help! Please help me!

01:16:33.751 --> 01:16:36.126
Hello? Anyone?

01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:37.792
Is anyone here?

01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:39.376
Please! Help!

Ki-woong, Ki-woong,
I'm still alive.

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:39.251
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:42.876
I am...

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:44.834
DARIM APARTMENT
MODEL HOUSE

01:17:44.959 --> 01:17:48.042
Darim Apartment...

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:51.167
I'm inside the model house.

01:17:53.834 --> 01:17:56.334
<i>- It's all right.</i>
- Ki-woong.

01:17:57.251 --> 01:17:59.584
<i>I'll be there straight away!</i>

01:18:00.084 --> 01:18:01.792
<i>I'll come right away.</i>

01:18:02.376 --> 01:18:03.667
Please hurry.

01:18:04.376 --> 01:18:05.667
Hurry...

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.959
Hye-sun, Hye-sun.

01:19:40.417 --> 01:19:41.709
Hye-sun...

01:19:43.667 --> 01:19:45.209
Ki-woong.

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:49.209
It's all over, it's OK.

01:19:51.626 --> 01:19:54.459
Ki-woong, is it safe now?

01:19:56.084 --> 01:20:00.667
Yeah, it's safe,
we can go home now.

01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:07.459
And dad? Where is he?

01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:11.709
Don't worry, he's OK.

01:20:11.834 --> 01:20:13.959
We split up to look for you.

01:20:15.292 --> 01:20:18.084
- He's really OK?
- Yeah.

01:20:18.209 --> 01:20:21.834
- He wasn't well...
- He's very good.

01:20:23.626 --> 01:20:27.084
That's good,
that's really good.

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:31.792
Look! Here he comes.

01:20:32.667 --> 01:20:34.001
- Sir!
- Daddy!

01:20:34.126 --> 01:20:35.251
I found her!

01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:40.501
Hye-sun, my darling!

01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:42.334
You were here!

01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:49.501
Hye-sun! I finally found you!

01:20:49.626 --> 01:20:53.876
I almost died finding you,
you fucking bitch!

01:20:56.417 --> 01:20:58.709
He's not my dad.

01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:00.209
What?

01:21:00.792 --> 01:21:02.959
He was my pimp...

01:21:04.167 --> 01:21:10.042
If you borrowed money,
you gotta pay it back!

01:21:10.167 --> 01:21:14.042
How could you leave me
hanging like that?

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:16.792
Because you ran away...

01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:19.542
Goddamn it!

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.126
Shit!

01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:27.459
You messed me up, real good!

01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:31.501
Please don't...
You said you were her dad!

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:34.126
That's right, idiot.

01:21:34.251 --> 01:21:37.876
I'm a dad to all the girls
I pimp out!

01:21:38.584 --> 01:21:39.876
Call me dad!

01:21:40.001 --> 01:21:42.667
Let's go, let's get back.

01:21:42.792 --> 01:21:43.834
Come on!

01:21:43.959 --> 01:21:44.959
Let go!

01:21:45.084 --> 01:21:47.167
Please don't do this, OK?

01:21:47.292 --> 01:21:48.792
Son of a bitch!

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.626
How dare you?

01:21:54.501 --> 01:21:55.876
You're so dead!

01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.542
Come at me, asshole?

01:21:59.667 --> 01:22:01.501
Get the hell up!

01:22:09.334 --> 01:22:10.417
Fuck! I'll kill you.

01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:12.167
- Boss...
- What?

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:14.334
- I'm begging you...
- Why are you crying?

01:22:14.459 --> 01:22:18.834
Let me just go home, please?

01:22:18.959 --> 01:22:21.501
I want to go home!

01:22:21.626 --> 01:22:23.292
Home?

01:22:23.417 --> 01:22:27.001
Sure, and you can.

01:22:27.126 --> 01:22:30.042
After paying me back, bitch!

01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:34.209
There's no going home
before then, you cunt!

01:22:34.876 --> 01:22:36.667
You bitch!

01:22:36.792 --> 01:22:39.001
Stupid whore!

01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:42.501
Please!

01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:45.001
- Please let me go!
- Goddamn...

01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:51.709
Please!

01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:56.042
So pathetic!

01:22:58.209 --> 01:22:59.417
You bastard!

01:23:00.792 --> 01:23:02.209
Goddammit!

01:23:06.417 --> 01:23:08.251
No, please!

01:23:08.834 --> 01:23:10.334
Ki-woong!

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:26.876
Come here!

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:30.917
Bastard...

01:23:41.542 --> 01:23:42.959
Where the hell?

01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:55.501
Where is she?

01:24:01.042 --> 01:24:02.542
Dammit...

01:24:04.376 --> 01:24:05.542
Huh?

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:16.167
Where the hell is she?

01:24:18.209 --> 01:24:19.667
Sneaky bitch...

01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:36.001
Where is she?

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:51.834
Why is this place so big?

01:24:53.959 --> 01:24:57.126
When will I ever live
in a place like this?

01:24:57.251 --> 01:25:01.042
Hye-sun! No thanks to runaways
with debts like you,

01:25:01.167 --> 01:25:03.876
I'll never live in such so luxury!

01:25:09.626 --> 01:25:10.834
Whoa!

01:25:10.959 --> 01:25:14.876
Just look at this!
So much variety.

01:25:16.501 --> 01:25:19.667
I wish I could fuck in here.

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:22.292
Hye-sun!

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:28.667
If you hadn't taken my money,
I could be living here.

01:25:29.501 --> 01:25:33.251
Sweetie, let's go eat.
I'm starving.

01:25:42.209 --> 01:25:44.042
Hye-sun.

01:25:44.167 --> 01:25:45.292
Hye-sun!

01:25:48.459 --> 01:25:53.209
Listen, you keep saying
you want to go home.

01:25:53.334 --> 01:25:55.834
Should I let you in on something?

01:25:55.959 --> 01:26:00.709
After you took off,
I went to your place to collect.

01:26:01.667 --> 01:26:04.917
Your dad was really sick.

01:26:05.042 --> 01:26:07.084
Do you know what I told him?

01:26:08.251 --> 01:26:11.292
That you took my money and left,

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:15.917
so he should pay back
his kid's debt instead.

01:26:16.042 --> 01:26:20.709
Then he asked me for just a week.

01:26:20.834 --> 01:26:22.959
He said he needed a week.

01:26:23.084 --> 01:26:25.501
So what do I do?

01:26:26.251 --> 01:26:29.459
I actually waited a week.

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:33.417
But he didn't show after a week.

01:26:33.542 --> 01:26:35.584
So I went back to his place.

01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:39.626
Holy shit...

01:26:39.751 --> 01:26:43.209
You keep saying
you want to go home,

01:26:44.334 --> 01:26:48.959
but do you know
what I saw there?

01:26:49.084 --> 01:26:51.792
Your sick father had fled.

01:26:53.501 --> 01:26:56.209
That's your father!

01:26:57.376 --> 01:27:00.126
The daughter takes off
with borrowed money,

01:27:00.251 --> 01:27:04.501
and the father takes off
and abandons his kid.

01:27:05.126 --> 01:27:06.334
Hye-sun,

01:27:06.959 --> 01:27:11.167
the home that you know
is long gone.

01:27:22.834 --> 01:27:23.917
Die!

01:27:24.042 --> 01:27:25.251
Damn bitch!

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:29.792
Sneaky rat!

01:27:33.042 --> 01:27:34.459
Stupid bitch!

01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:14.417
What the hell?

01:28:14.542 --> 01:28:16.042
Hey!

01:28:16.167 --> 01:28:18.876
Hey! What's wrong?

01:28:19.501 --> 01:28:23.751
Wake up! Hey! Hye-sun?

01:28:24.626 --> 01:28:25.792
Dammit!

01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:30.792
Don't die, baby! Hye-sun!

01:28:32.959 --> 01:28:35.001
Please don't! I'm sorry!

01:28:35.126 --> 01:28:37.251
Hye-sun! It's all my fault!

01:28:39.042 --> 01:28:41.709
Please don't die!

01:28:43.792 --> 01:28:47.167
Pay me back first, you bitch!

01:29:14.626 --> 01:29:16.167
Shit...

01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:18.959
Hye-sun...
