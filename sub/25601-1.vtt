and weapons.

00:19.795 --> 00:21.097
You really think you're

00:21.130 --> 00:22.598
I want back in the game.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.367

very proud of you.

02:42.238 --> 02:44.840
My fellow Americans,

02:44.873 --> 02:47.243
I must speak to you tonight
about a mounting danger

02:47.276 --> 02:49.178
in Central America
that threatens

02:49.212 --> 02:50.679
the security of
the United States.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.681
The plan
to aid rebels fighting

02:52.715 --> 02:54.583
the Nicaraguan government
is in trouble in the House.

02:54.617 --> 02:57.052
The administration
has given the Contras

02:57.086 --> 03:01.224
at least $100 million
in the last five years.

03:01.257 --> 03:04.059
And they can't even tell us
how that money was spent.

03:04.093 --> 03:06.429
REAGAN: If we cut off
the freedom fighters

03:06.462 --> 03:08.264
we will be giving
the Soviets

03:08.297 --> 03:10.533

is asking for

in Central America...

03:15.438 --> 03:16.739
(pager buzzes)

REAGAN:
Is so small, so minimal,

03:18.807 --> 03:20.409
considering what is at stake.

03:20.443 --> 03:23.212
The total amount
requested for aid

-I'm sorry?

13:26.681 --> 13:28.884
Have the plane delivered
to Kansas City.

13:28.917 --> 13:32.020
Kansas side, any small airport
west of downtown will do.

13:32.054 --> 13:33.989
What's in Kansas city?

Just saying, a little
heads up would be nice.

13:41.596 --> 13:43.398
But I like seeing you,
Frankie.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.234
Even--even Leon here
is growing on me.

13:46.268 --> 13:48.336
You know how stressful it is
to ride through Encino

13:48.370 --> 13:50.205
with this much fucking coin
in a car?

13:50.238 --> 13:51.840
Okay.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.676
Maybe Leon is not
growing on me so much.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.912
I got a few ounces
lying around somewhere

13:56.945 --> 13:59.181
so you don't feel
I've wasted your time.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.049
Muir,

14:01.083 --> 14:03.718
go to the stash, see what
you can find for Frankie.

14:03.752 --> 14:05.253
MUIR: You got it.

14:05.287 --> 14:07.522
You know...

14:07.555 --> 14:09.357
not too long ago
you were happy

14:09.391 --> 14:11.726
with just
a few hundred dollars.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.528
How we grow, huh.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.597
Likes weeds.

14:17.599 --> 14:19.467
Hey.

14:22.137 --> 14:24.072
Friday.

14:24.106 --> 14:28.043
Come over for Shabbat dinner,
wear a nice coat.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.212
Come on, Franklin.
You have money now.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.114
Get yourself a nice coat.

Hey, what's going on?

15:41.149 --> 15:42.784
Hit him with a 69PC.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.987
-The fuck is a 69PC--
-Felony evading.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.155
Why the fuck you ain't
say that then?

No, you's a moron, Biscuit.

Look.
Least they ain't trying

15:53.528 --> 15:56.031
to rope him in on
a possession of weapons beef.

15:56.064 --> 15:58.133
Now the bad news is,
your boy's got priors,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.168

bail's 50.

16:00.202 --> 16:01.970

You getting paranoid.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.504
Avi and Leon are locked up.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.040
And I just spent the whole

16:38.073 --> 16:40.675
running around Encino
with 42 Gs in a duffel bag

16:40.708 --> 16:44.379

Maybe I'm a little on edge.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.191
Well, with Avi in the clink,

39:30.911 --> 39:32.379
at the department.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.948
Hey, please don't open that.
Don't open that.

39:36.617 --> 39:39.286
-So you're not worried at all?
-Worried about what?

39:39.320 --> 39:43.056
MATT: About that guy, Avi,
deciding to roll on you.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.791
Not really.
I mean, even if he did,

39:44.825 --> 39:46.226
they'd just be chasing
Reed Thompson.

39:46.259 --> 39:47.894
Who's that?

39:47.928 --> 39:49.796
Exactly.

39:49.830 --> 39:51.732
Oh.

39:51.765 --> 39:54.468
So do I get an alias too?

39:54.501 --> 39:55.902
Mm-hmm.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.804
And you should start calling
me Reed.

39:57.838 --> 40:00.273
Okay, Reed.

40:00.307 --> 40:02.976
If you're in the clear,
what's the problem?

40:03.009 --> 40:05.312
The problem is,
we're about import

40:05.346 --> 40:08.315
50 keys of Colombian White.

40:08.349 --> 40:10.116
I got no one to buy it.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.321
MATT: So we need to find
a drug dealer.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.762
Talked to Claudia again,
about the club.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.964
-Mm.
-Offered her a blank check.

40:23.997 --> 40:25.932
She ain't gonna sell, huh?

40:25.966 --> 40:27.801
You know there's other ways
I could push her out.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.302
(scoffs)
Like how?

40:29.336 --> 40:30.804
She got cops on the payroll

40:30.837 --> 40:33.273
so it ain't like you can
just shut it down.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.142
And you ain't gonna kill her,
so what else is there?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.780
Hey...

40:39.813 --> 40:42.182
-can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

40:42.215 --> 40:43.650
You know I noticed
you've been spending

40:43.684 --> 40:45.686
a lot of time over there.

40:45.719 --> 40:47.488
With her.

40:49.556 --> 40:52.292
-Is that a question?
-(laughs) Look...

40:52.325 --> 40:54.495
It ain't my business how you
and Jerome live your lives.

40:54.528 --> 40:56.630
I'm just sayin'
if you falling for Claudia,

40:56.663 --> 40:57.964
it's bad for business.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.366
That's a problem.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.668
You know that.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.473
Or maybe I'm just
getting close to her

41:06.507 --> 41:08.809
trying to figure out a way
to get my hands on that club.

41:08.842 --> 41:11.311
Seeing as how
you seem to be unable.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.480
(scoffs)
Look. Look. Look.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.881
I'ma handle it, okay?

41:14.915 --> 41:16.483
I promise.

41:16.517 --> 41:19.185
I mean, it might not
be a Christmas present, but...

41:19.219 --> 41:21.321
I'ma get it done, okay?

41:21.354 --> 41:23.056
(laughs)

41:25.358 --> 41:28.094
(whistling)

41:32.566 --> 41:35.602

41:39.706 --> 41:42.208
I'm gonna piss.

41:42.242 --> 41:44.745
Anything else you want
to tell me?

41:58.559 --> 42:00.260

42:02.763 --> 42:04.731
LUCIA: Oso?

42:10.571 --> 42:12.473

42:40.967 --> 42:42.936
