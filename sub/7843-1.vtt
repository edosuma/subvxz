00:58.790 --> 01:00.757
How much further?

01:02.191 --> 01:03.818
Wait. Wait. No.

01:05.694 --> 01:08.218
- Okay, you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.955
What do you think?

01:22.603 --> 01:24.593
What? You don't like it?

01:24.704 --> 01:28.035
No. It's a junkyard, Cade.

01:28.139 --> 01:29.935
Yeah, but it's an investment.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.605
You didn't sign anything,
did you?

01:32.708 --> 01:36.074
Yeah, and I got it for a steal.

01:36.177 --> 01:38.507
- Take me home.
- I can't.

01:38.611 --> 01:40.602
What do you mean, you can't?

01:40.712 --> 01:42.680
I let go of our lease.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.873
No. Call them.

01:44.981 --> 01:47.210
Tell them we want it back.

01:47.315 --> 01:51.182
They've already rented our place,
and this place is ours now.

01:53.119 --> 01:54.915
You spent our wedding money?

01:57.522 --> 01:59.512
In a couple of years,
they're gonna build a freeway

01:59.623 --> 02:01.556
just two blocks from here.

02:01.657 --> 02:03.521
It took us over an
hour to get here.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.455
You're not gonna want
to drive this every day.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.683
I quit my job.

02:13.697 --> 02:15.664
I want to start a business here.

02:17.732 --> 02:21.167
Come on. Please.
Just let me show you the lot.

02:23.702 --> 02:26.568
Let me just show you where
I want to build our dream home.

02:30.806 --> 02:32.295
You see all this?

02:32.406 --> 02:34.839
It's all ours.
10 acres.

02:34.941 --> 02:39.035
Over there, that's where I want
to build our dream house.

02:39.143 --> 02:41.804
During the day I'm gonna fix
people's cars,

02:41.912 --> 02:44.106
and at night I'll
design the house.

02:45.814 --> 02:47.474
You're gonna fix
people's cars?

02:47.581 --> 02:50.071
Yeah. I'm an engineer.
How hard can it be?

02:50.183 --> 02:52.116
Right?

02:54.351 --> 02:57.910
Hey, have I ever let you down?

03:02.489 --> 03:04.422
No.

03:29.971 --> 03:33.029
Hey, come on.
Give it a chance.

03:43.244 --> 03:45.734
It's only temporary.

03:47.213 --> 03:49.339
Let me check in with the movers.

03:58.352 --> 04:02.117
Hey, they're gonna be here soon
with all of our stuff, okay?

04:02.221 --> 04:04.155
Okay.

05:01.787 --> 05:03.276
Cade?

05:27.033 --> 05:29.728
What do you mean,
you can't find our stuff?

05:29.835 --> 05:31.927
Hello?

05:32.036 --> 05:33.468
Shit.

05:44.142 --> 05:46.075
- Cade!
- Damn.

05:46.177 --> 05:47.837
You scared me.

05:47.944 --> 05:49.604
What the hell are you
doing up here?

05:49.711 --> 05:51.940
I was just talking
to the movers.

05:53.147 --> 05:54.875
And they said?

05:54.981 --> 06:00.610
That all of our stuff
will be here next week.

06:00.717 --> 06:02.980
Next week?

06:03.085 --> 06:04.984
Yeah, next week.

06:19.195 --> 06:20.752
Oh, baby.

06:25.398 --> 06:27.297
Oh, God!

06:30.800 --> 06:33.233
What the hell was that noise?

06:33.335 --> 06:34.767
What?

06:36.970 --> 06:38.631
Go check it out.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.702
It's just coyotes.

07:00.883 --> 07:03.544
What's sad is when that freeway
comes through here,

07:03.651 --> 07:06.380
those animals are
gonna lose their homes.

07:06.486 --> 07:09.749
But we'll be sitting
on a gold mine.

07:11.622 --> 07:14.488
Look at these two.

07:14.591 --> 07:16.683
Give 'em half the chance,
they'll fill my--

07:22.761 --> 07:26.889
...fill my place up with a bunch
of fuckin' bastard rat kids.

07:28.598 --> 07:30.997
They fuck like rabbits.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.143
- Cade, Cade, wake up!
- What the hell are you doing?

08:11.254 --> 08:14.347
- There's something under this bed.
- What?

08:14.456 --> 08:16.582
There's something
under this bed, this trailer.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.680
I don't know.
There's something down there.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.398
It's just a bunch of old junk.

08:45.006 --> 08:47.064
Please go out there
and check it out.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.636
All right.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.220
Looks like it's just a cat.

09:39.334 --> 09:41.324
What is it?

09:41.435 --> 09:42.959
Nothing.

10:22.123 --> 10:23.090
- Jess!
- Cade!

10:35.364 --> 10:38.628
The trailer shifted.
My arm's pinned.

10:38.733 --> 10:40.700
What should I do?
Should I call the paramedics?

10:40.801 --> 10:43.268
- What do you need?
- No. You won't be able to get a signal.

10:43.368 --> 10:46.234
If you could help me lift,
we might be able to get it out.

10:46.337 --> 10:48.736
Okay.

10:48.838 --> 10:51.397
- Oh, shit.
- I can't make it move.

10:53.741 --> 10:58.142
Get the jack out of the car.

10:58.243 --> 10:59.971
Get the jack for the car.

11:00.078 --> 11:01.567
- Where are the keys?
- I don't know.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.539
Oh, God!

11:17.520 --> 11:20.282
Jess! Hurry!

11:21.723 --> 11:23.485
Hurry.

11:30.394 --> 11:32.724
Oh, my God!

11:36.430 --> 11:38.829
Yeah.
No, the other way.

11:44.234 --> 11:45.632
Crank it.

12:03.378 --> 12:04.844
Thanks.

12:08.714 --> 12:11.772
What did the doctor say?

12:11.882 --> 12:16.283
He said I might need an operation,
but it's too early to say.

12:21.221 --> 12:25.656
Cade, I know this isn't
the best time to bring it up...

12:29.392 --> 12:32.326
There's something
really wrong with that place.

12:34.028 --> 12:38.326
You want me to sell the place
and get my old job back, don't you?

12:39.964 --> 12:42.955
They're not gonna take me back
with my arm like this.

12:48.802 --> 12:52.099
All right. I'll call
the real estate agent tomorrow.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.833
No. You don't have to.

13:02.109 --> 13:04.338
Are you sure?

13:05.778 --> 13:07.836
Yeah.

13:07.945 --> 13:09.912
Yeah, I'm sure.

13:13.982 --> 13:17.610
You know,
you mean the world to me.

13:17.718 --> 13:20.742
If it wasn't for you
and what you've done for me,

13:20.852 --> 13:23.786
God knows where I'd be right now.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.721
We don't have $2,500.

13:31.825 --> 13:34.554
And that's not the price
we agreed on.

13:37.795 --> 13:39.421
Deliver our stuff.

13:41.097 --> 13:43.825
It's just a bunch of old junk.

13:52.335 --> 13:54.064
You must be Jess.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.673
- Martin.
- Cade.

14:03.775 --> 14:08.233
Honey, this is Martin, the Realtor
that sold us this place.

14:15.615 --> 14:17.707
I hurt it out back.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.750
That's too bad.

14:20.851 --> 14:23.250
You want to come inside
for a drink?

14:23.352 --> 14:25.342
You know, l...

14:25.454 --> 14:28.422
I just came by to see
how you guys were doing.

14:30.323 --> 14:32.313
You sure?
It'll just take a minute.

14:32.424 --> 14:36.358
- I'm late for an appointment already.
- Okay.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.757
- Nice meeting you, Jess.
- Yeah.

15:01.539 --> 15:03.768
Happy little...

15:10.044 --> 15:12.011
Iittle fucking couple.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.976
Need architects, electricians,

15:14.079 --> 15:16.672
framers, plumbers, you know...

15:18.348 --> 15:21.407
whatever it takes to
build a new house.

15:23.885 --> 15:26.409
What? You're breaking up.

15:37.859 --> 15:39.883
No use for this anymore.

15:57.236 --> 15:59.726
I can see you're feeling better.

16:00.804 --> 16:02.237
Yeah.

16:02.339 --> 16:03.930
That sounds good.

16:04.039 --> 16:06.905
Yeah, send 'em out.
I'll talk to you later.

16:38.691 --> 16:39.952
Cade?

16:57.668 --> 16:59.328
Cade!

17:22.182 --> 17:23.512
Cade?

18:33.819 --> 18:35.116
Cade?

19:33.784 --> 19:35.375
Hey, baby.

19:40.021 --> 19:43.387
How long have you
been here working?

19:43.490 --> 19:46.423
Ten minutes.
Why?

19:46.524 --> 19:48.650
You okay?

19:48.759 --> 19:51.955
Yeah.

19:52.061 --> 19:54.028
Yeah, I'm okay.

19:56.830 --> 19:59.024
You found my phone.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.496
Must've dropped it.

20:01.866 --> 20:04.163
Stupid arm, you know?

20:04.268 --> 20:07.361
- Are you okay?
- I said I'm fine.

20:09.803 --> 20:13.636
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go take a nap.

20:13.740 --> 20:16.298
Yeah. Okay.

20:16.407 --> 20:19.273
Yeah. I'm tired.

21:29.279 --> 21:31.109
Jess?

22:19.173 --> 22:20.696
How do you know they're gone?

22:22.607 --> 22:26.440
Well, when I looked over
the fence, their car was gone.

22:30.412 --> 22:32.379
You better be right.

22:34.281 --> 22:37.806
Yeah, those folks from the city
always have nice stuff.

22:49.689 --> 22:51.849
Go wake up your little brother.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.918
Cade!

23:02.096 --> 23:03.824
Cade!

23:13.035 --> 23:14.092
Jess?

23:41.784 --> 23:43.683
Cade!

23:54.524 --> 23:56.081
Cade!

23:56.191 --> 23:57.521
Jess?

24:13.634 --> 24:14.861
Jess?

24:16.301 --> 24:17.962
Unlock the door.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.981
Jess?

24:47.419 --> 24:48.386
Jess?

24:52.622 --> 24:53.588
Cade.

25:01.726 --> 25:04.353
What happened to your...

25:05.628 --> 25:07.255
They're gone.

25:15.167 --> 25:16.394
Oh, my God.

25:17.701 --> 25:20.601
He wants you to kill...

25:20.702 --> 25:22.397
He what?
Who wants?

25:24.572 --> 25:28.802
He wants you to kill anyone
that comes on the property, or...

25:28.908 --> 25:30.966
or he'll kill me.

25:33.509 --> 25:35.340
You'd better f--

25:37.045 --> 25:38.671
You'd better fucking do it.

25:53.887 --> 25:57.480
Who in the hell are
these two retards?

26:02.759 --> 26:05.124
Peek-a-boo!

26:07.228 --> 26:09.195
Peek-a-boo!

26:13.131 --> 26:14.563
Peek-a-boo!

26:27.805 --> 26:29.829
You fuckin' idiot!

26:33.641 --> 26:36.234
Grab anything of value.

26:36.343 --> 26:37.934
I was.

26:38.044 --> 26:40.637
And do it before
these people get home!

26:42.580 --> 26:44.877
Don't listen to him.

26:48.283 --> 26:50.182
Maybe this'll change your mind.

27:04.391 --> 27:05.688
Stop it!

27:05.792 --> 27:07.760
Stop it!

27:24.069 --> 27:26.696
You guys, be quiet.

27:55.886 --> 27:57.318
You let her go.

27:58.787 --> 28:00.651
Let who go?

28:02.422 --> 28:03.911
Why don't you put that down?

28:06.258 --> 28:08.657
He's crazy.
Shoot his ass!

28:08.759 --> 28:10.487
Shut up.

28:10.593 --> 28:14.323
Seriously, boy,
put the sword down.

28:16.530 --> 28:18.997
Guys, let's go.

28:26.168 --> 28:28.931
You shot him good, didn't you?

28:31.071 --> 28:32.401
Goodness!

28:34.540 --> 28:36.564
We oughta go.

29:19.030 --> 29:20.894
Oh, no!

29:20.997 --> 29:22.624
Oh, no!

30:05.755 --> 30:05.855
He doesn't know?

30:05.855 --> 30:07.651
He doesn't know?

30:07.756 --> 30:09.950
No. Completely unaware of it.

30:11.458 --> 30:14.017
Does the guy, like,
read newspapers or what?

30:14.126 --> 30:15.820
He's not from around here.

30:15.927 --> 30:17.723
He moved here after all
that went down.

30:17.828 --> 30:20.591
Teresa's gonna be so pissed.

30:20.697 --> 30:22.561
Who's gonna be pissed?

30:22.664 --> 30:24.961
Teresa.

30:25.066 --> 30:27.464
She's always pissed
about something.

30:30.401 --> 30:34.096
Yeah, but you sold the one property
we were told to stay away from.

30:34.203 --> 30:35.727
So what?

30:35.838 --> 30:38.327
It just so happens that
you sold the one property--

30:38.439 --> 30:40.134
That Teresa's sister
was killed at.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.002
What, did she think nobody
was ever gonna buy it?

30:43.108 --> 30:44.904
Come on.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.839
You know, once that freeway
goes in over there,

30:46.943 --> 30:49.775
everybody's gonna be
buying property.

30:51.312 --> 30:54.678
She'll get over it.
It's just business.

31:12.191 --> 31:13.817
Hello?

31:21.195 --> 31:23.355
Mr. McBride!

31:28.599 --> 31:30.463
Oh, my God!

31:51.978 --> 31:54.070
Mr. McBride?

31:54.179 --> 31:57.704
I'm from TCR,
the architecture firm.

32:32.700 --> 32:37.226
Where the fuck are they?

32:38.836 --> 32:41.633
Son of a bitch!

33:04.650 --> 33:05.947
Cade?

33:17.357 --> 33:19.256
That was stupid!

33:19.358 --> 33:22.019
I didn't see a goddamn thing!

33:23.927 --> 33:26.121
I need to see the kill.

33:26.228 --> 33:29.594
That's the whole goddamn point!

33:33.232 --> 33:35.131
Cade, you killed someone?

33:41.236 --> 33:43.226
No.

33:43.337 --> 33:46.169
Jesus Christ.

33:46.273 --> 33:49.035
Get over it, bitch.

33:57.112 --> 33:59.477
Tell him to put everyone

33:59.580 --> 34:01.944
in the room with the cameras

34:02.047 --> 34:07.210
so I can see everything
this time, bitch.

34:14.521 --> 34:16.420
Tell him.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.219
Tell him what to do.

34:38.266 --> 34:43.429
He wants you to take them all
to the room with the cameras.

34:47.705 --> 34:52.800
He wants you to wear
a part of her...

34:54.909 --> 34:57.705
... Iike other killers do.

36:02.612 --> 36:05.205
I think that was their sign.

36:05.313 --> 36:08.940
She said Cade was gonna fix cars.

36:09.048 --> 36:12.777
Why would she let him talk her
into moving all the way out here?

36:12.884 --> 36:14.681
Because they're stupid.

36:16.286 --> 36:19.344
You're so rude sometimes.

36:19.454 --> 36:20.421
Come on.

36:20.522 --> 36:23.683
He quits his job,
he moves way the hell out here.

36:23.790 --> 36:28.384
He's stupid. And she's
stupid for following him.

36:28.492 --> 36:30.686
Just because you're not friends
with Cade anymore

36:30.794 --> 36:32.852
doesn't mean I have to stop
being friends with Jessie.

36:51.805 --> 36:54.671
That's the way
it's gonna be, huh?

37:01.744 --> 37:05.303
You know, your boy
already killed somebody.

37:05.412 --> 37:06.810
He's already...

37:09.080 --> 37:11.013
He's already a murderer.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.641
Like your new hands and feet?

37:19.586 --> 37:23.351
Well, they ain't yours,
exactly.

37:23.455 --> 37:26.445
Your boy,
he's got your hands and feet.

37:26.557 --> 37:27.524
Sleeps with 'em.

37:30.392 --> 37:32.484
Touch a nerve?

37:32.593 --> 37:35.425
Curls up with 'em
like a little teddy bear.

37:44.233 --> 37:46.200
Sorry about that.

37:46.301 --> 37:48.564
These nanners get me every time.

37:49.769 --> 37:52.794
Well, now that that's done...

37:54.538 --> 37:57.097
on to the next agenda.

37:57.207 --> 37:58.696
Now, you get ready.

37:58.807 --> 38:03.105
We're gonna be putting on
the show of shows.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.905
Here.
This is what I'm thinking.

38:06.011 --> 38:08.876
Motor Man's Death Show.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.113
Nah?

38:12.215 --> 38:14.774
I didn't think so, either.
All right, how about this?

38:14.883 --> 38:18.874
Motor Man's Torture Show.

38:21.153 --> 38:22.346
It's gonna be--

38:28.823 --> 38:29.915
Oh, man.

38:30.023 --> 38:33.514
I know how you feel.
I can smell that one, too.

38:33.626 --> 38:37.390
Hey, guys? Jessie?

38:37.494 --> 38:39.222
Jessie?

38:42.831 --> 38:43.922
Wow.

38:52.769 --> 38:55.066
The place is a fuckin' dump!

39:16.215 --> 39:17.647
Jessie?

39:19.150 --> 39:20.673
Cade?

39:40.161 --> 39:42.355
I'm gonna make me some
popcorn for this.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.300
Jessie?

39:57.170 --> 39:58.397
Cade?

40:29.888 --> 40:31.946
Ella?

40:34.924 --> 40:35.891
Ella!

40:41.127 --> 40:43.890
Ella! Ella!

42:24.382 --> 42:25.349
What are you doing?

42:28.117 --> 42:29.675
Cade, no.

42:29.785 --> 42:32.218
Put it down.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.253
Cade, we can figure this out.

43:05.804 --> 43:07.236
Kinda scrawny.

43:09.373 --> 43:11.465
You ain't nothin'
like my first one.

43:11.574 --> 43:13.438
Now, he...

43:16.610 --> 43:19.339
He was wonderful.

43:19.445 --> 43:21.639
You ain't wonderful.

43:42.924 --> 43:47.325
What good is a medical license
when you do fine work like this?

43:49.961 --> 43:51.519
How long's she been missing?

43:52.863 --> 43:55.490
She was last seen on the 23rd.

43:57.732 --> 44:00.631
What was she doing on
the property?

44:00.733 --> 44:04.168
She's an architect. She was
going to meet the new owners.

44:04.269 --> 44:07.361
Somebody bought that place?

44:07.470 --> 44:09.699
From what I understand.

44:32.117 --> 44:33.606
I bet that drill's hot.

44:33.718 --> 44:37.652
I bet that burns, bitchy.
I bet that burns.

44:46.658 --> 44:48.682
He's getting better.

45:10.871 --> 45:13.337
Mr. McBride?

45:13.439 --> 45:15.668
Detective Clark and Murray.

45:15.773 --> 45:18.764
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

45:23.078 --> 45:25.443
Someone's here.

45:27.880 --> 45:29.540
Why don't you go
around that fence?

45:29.648 --> 45:31.205
I'm gonna go right
through here.

45:57.629 --> 45:59.186
Who's there?

46:30.314 --> 46:32.543
Mr. McBride?

46:34.716 --> 46:37.376
I just got a couple of
questions I want to ask you.

46:55.494 --> 46:57.461
This is gonna be good.

46:57.561 --> 46:59.425
This is gonna be real good.

47:50.956 --> 47:54.720
He's good.
This little bastard's good.

47:54.825 --> 47:56.985
Hello?

47:57.093 --> 48:00.084
This is Detective Murray from
the Phoenix Police Department.

48:05.697 --> 48:07.163
Miss?

49:08.031 --> 49:09.361
Clark?

49:09.464 --> 49:10.590
I'm in here.

49:13.733 --> 49:15.098
Clark!

49:16.435 --> 49:17.493
Shit!

49:21.471 --> 49:23.233
Jesus!

49:23.339 --> 49:25.772
Where's your gun?

49:25.874 --> 49:27.773
He...

49:27.875 --> 49:29.341
He must've took it.

49:29.442 --> 49:33.240
Okay, could you call for back-up?

49:33.344 --> 49:35.573
Yeah. I'll call.

50:18.868 --> 50:19.960
Shit!

51:11.097 --> 51:12.996
What a fuckin' idiot.

53:03.923 --> 53:06.482
I know you're in there, buddy.

53:06.591 --> 53:10.389
I won't think twice about
blowing your fucking head off.

53:19.965 --> 53:21.226
Shit!

53:33.305 --> 53:35.000
Go for the gun.

53:35.107 --> 53:37.097
Oh, no. Wait.
Don't go for the gun.

53:45.679 --> 53:49.078
I told you not to
go for the gun, jackass.

53:53.950 --> 53:55.041
Jackass.

53:57.418 --> 53:59.385
Fuck, fuck.

54:56.016 --> 54:58.677
Shit!

54:58.785 --> 55:00.308
What the helI'd you do that for?

55:00.419 --> 55:02.147
And the property owners
are fine with it?

55:02.253 --> 55:04.311
They're perfectly fine with this.

55:07.589 --> 55:09.647
All right, already.
I didn't tell 'em.

55:11.592 --> 55:12.558
You know what?

55:12.658 --> 55:15.592
We are going out there,
and we are gonna tell them.

55:15.694 --> 55:17.422
Can I go with?

55:20.629 --> 55:22.119
I can go Thursday.

55:25.399 --> 55:26.661
You're talking now?

55:26.766 --> 55:28.290
Yeah.

55:47.244 --> 55:48.710
So this is the place.

55:54.914 --> 55:58.280
Well, what do we have here?

56:03.552 --> 56:06.520
A little thin for my tastes,

56:06.621 --> 56:08.747
but they'll do.

56:08.855 --> 56:11.687
Look at the pooper on that one.

56:14.892 --> 56:17.485
Looks like they're not home.

56:17.593 --> 56:20.617
Then we'll wait for 'em.

56:24.297 --> 56:27.128
It's not a good idea
to be wandering around here.

56:28.866 --> 56:31.492
We should stay out here
until they get back.

57:24.696 --> 57:29.653
Oh, I wish I was in the
land of cotton

57:29.765 --> 57:34.791
Good times there
are not forgotten

57:34.901 --> 57:36.561
Look away...

57:45.140 --> 57:47.107
Dixieland

57:50.410 --> 57:52.502
I wish I were in Dixie

57:52.610 --> 57:55.373
Hooray

57:55.479 --> 57:57.105
Hooray

57:57.213 --> 58:00.875
I'm gonna go wait in the car
until they get back.

58:20.159 --> 58:23.285
"Bodies of the victims

58:23.393 --> 58:26.259
"were then stored
in a small room

58:26.362 --> 58:28.420
to the north of the property."

58:36.300 --> 58:38.199
That's right.

58:38.301 --> 58:40.359
We were in all the papers.

58:41.837 --> 58:44.463
We were all famous.

58:50.674 --> 58:51.902
Wow.

58:54.577 --> 58:56.373
Where's my car?

59:24.293 --> 59:27.317
- Someone took my car!
- What?

59:27.427 --> 59:29.519
- Where I left it, it's not...
- Will you relax?

59:29.629 --> 59:31.994
Just calm down.
Maybe the owners moved it.

59:32.097 --> 59:34.326
What?

59:35.665 --> 59:38.394
Did you leave the keys
in the ignition?

59:42.035 --> 59:43.024
What?

59:45.404 --> 59:46.893
What are you looking at?

59:47.005 --> 59:50.201
- Where's Karen?
- She's off somewhere. I...

59:50.307 --> 59:53.604
I told you there's no
reception out here.

01:00:02.113 --> 01:00:04.137
What are you looking for?

01:00:18.122 --> 01:00:21.419
- Where are you going?
- Will you be quiet?

01:00:21.523 --> 01:00:23.717
Okay.

01:01:00.678 --> 01:01:01.871
What the hell was that?

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.413
Martin! Martin!

01:01:08.515 --> 01:01:09.743
I'm leaving.

01:01:09.849 --> 01:01:11.873
What?
We can't leave without Karen.

01:01:11.984 --> 01:01:13.951
Yeah, we can.

01:01:14.052 --> 01:01:16.246
What?

01:01:16.353 --> 01:01:17.979
Shit.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.130
Karen?

01:05:38.859 --> 01:05:42.294
I think he's on to us, kids.

01:05:42.394 --> 01:05:44.725
He ain't stupid.
I'll give him that.

01:06:44.927 --> 01:06:46.826
What are you doing?

01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:53.522
Who are you?

01:07:00.336 --> 01:07:02.394
What are you--
What are you doing?

01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:31.281
Good boy.

01:08:02.335 --> 01:08:05.326
This bitch has got
balls of stone.

01:08:14.009 --> 01:08:17.807
There's no way you can
pull that bolt out.

01:08:26.582 --> 01:08:29.015
Un-fuckin'-believable!

01:09:04.635 --> 01:09:06.693
Fuck me.

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:22.075
Where the hell is she?

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:03.257
There she is!

01:12:34.714 --> 01:12:37.409
What... Karen!

01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:08.754
Can't believe this one
grew some nuts.

01:15:38.678 --> 01:15:41.646
That skinny little bitch
turned sideways and disappeared.

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.089
There he is.

01:16:52.018 --> 01:16:53.780
What the hell?

01:17:12.863 --> 01:17:15.830
You know I don't like it
when I can't see you!

01:17:36.309 --> 01:17:38.276
What the fuck you looking at?

01:17:44.847 --> 01:17:49.645
Why don't you go the fuck over
there and do your goddamn job,

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:52.045
you skinny pantywaist fuck-stick!

01:17:59.287 --> 01:18:02.812
Kinda makes me wish I had the big,
retard from last time, doesn't it?

01:18:10.527 --> 01:18:13.426
What in the hell are you doing?

01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:22.460
You little fuckin' prick...

01:18:22.566 --> 01:18:24.692
... bastard!

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:29.892
That's it.
That's fucking it.

01:18:30.004 --> 01:18:32.937
I am so fucking done with you.

01:18:33.038 --> 01:18:35.801
I ain't letting go
this time, bitch.

01:18:38.442 --> 01:18:39.874
Cade!

01:18:41.376 --> 01:18:42.809
Cade!

01:18:50.548 --> 01:18:51.741
We're gonna find Teresa,

01:18:51.848 --> 01:18:54.338
and we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay?

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:56.417
Where's my camera?

01:19:02.687 --> 01:19:05.280
I'll find your camera.

01:21:07.588 --> 01:21:10.385
We got to lock the car.

01:21:10.489 --> 01:21:13.650
You got to remember
to lock the car.

01:21:16.993 --> 01:21:19.187
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:21:47.243 --> 01:21:49.210
Get my camera.

01:22:06.152 --> 01:22:07.914
Did you get my camera?

01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:47.903
Cade.

01:25:22.057 --> 01:25:24.285
Get away from the girl!

01:25:29.627 --> 01:25:31.821
Get your ass away from
the girl now!

01:25:31.929 --> 01:25:33.486
Now!

01:26:33.695 --> 01:26:36.128
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie

01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.857
Hooray, hooray

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:46.732
I'll make my stand
for Dixieland

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:49.632
Oh, somethin' somethin',
Dixie
