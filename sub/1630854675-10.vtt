21:26.844 --> 21:29.436
The tree?

21:29.455 --> 21:33.516
We came here for relief
from the devastation

21:33.534 --> 21:36.519
of watching our entire vision
of our future fall apart.

21:36.537 --> 21:41.524
And you came
for a tree and golf?

21:41.526 --> 21:43.784
- Don't judge our fantasies.

21:43.861 --> 21:47.287
- Oh, I'm not going
to judge them.

21:47.365 --> 21:50.866
I'm going to destroy them.

21:50.885 --> 21:53.126
- What are you do--hey!

21:53.204 --> 21:55.688
What are you doing?
Hey, those are mine!

22:03.047 --> 22:05.406
Oh, no, you don't.

22:10.054 --> 22:11.996
- Oh, hi!

22:14.334 --> 22:16.575
Uh-oh.

22:16.727 --> 22:17.960
Oh!

22:20.064 --> 22:22.423
Hey!
Maybe slow down?

- [shouts]

22:25.753 --> 22:28.012
- OK.

Double uh-oh.

22:30.575 --> 22:31.557
No, no, no.

22:35.429 --> 22:36.354
- Friends.

22:36.581 --> 22:37.913
We're friends.

Uh-oh.

22:41.919 --> 22:43.694
- Sit.

22:48.092 --> 22:49.608
Hydrating.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.852
Always good.

22:51.929 --> 22:54.279

22:58.527 --> 23:00.378
Why is this so hard?

I feel like I don't even
know how to talk to you.

23:04.775 --> 23:07.776
- I think it's because we're
trying to go back to being

23:07.795 --> 23:12.297
just friends, and the truth is,
we were never just friends,

23:12.374 --> 23:14.800
you know?

23:14.952 --> 23:17.953
- Sorry, um, Elena?

23:17.972 --> 23:19.688
We have a problem.

You are not welcome here.

What are you doing?

24:08.339 --> 24:10.614
- Put that down!
- Stop.

24:10.766 --> 24:12.116
And not a word.

24:12.267 --> 24:14.785
The island has given you
ample opportunity

24:14.862 --> 24:18.197
to resolve your differences,
and you have failed to do so.

24:18.273 --> 24:20.583
So we're going to try
a different way.

24:21.852 --> 24:23.777

24:23.796 --> 24:26.188
I was not expecting that.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.966
- Now, sit your asses down.
We're going to finish this.

24:41.388 --> 24:43.647
- Seth and Natalie.
Vivian and Lou.

24:43.724 --> 24:46.800
Clearly, you are unable
to remain neighbors.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.343
- Agreed.
- Damn straight.

24:48.379 --> 24:49.487
- But we're not moving.

24:49.563 --> 24:51.304
- Well, if you think we are,
you're high.

24:51.382 --> 24:53.549
- Well, since you can't
decide on your own

24:53.567 --> 24:56.518
which couple will move,
the island will decide.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.663
But be forewarned,
the decision is binding.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.577
Let's begin.

25:05.730 --> 25:06.578
- All rise.

25:06.731 --> 25:08.731
Island justice
is now in session.

25:08.733 --> 25:11.917
The case of the Hutchinsons
versus the Roses.

25:11.994 --> 25:13.252
- Island justice?

25:13.404 --> 25:15.596
- It's good, right?
[chuckles]

25:17.925 --> 25:20.851
- Vivian and Lou, you're going
to present your case first.

25:20.928 --> 25:22.353
- Mm-hmm.

25:22.429 --> 25:24.063
- The rest of you,
please be seated.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.695
- We're not lawyers.

25:31.847 --> 25:34.698
- The island will help
with that.

25:34.850 --> 25:36.275
- [sighs]

25:36.277 --> 25:39.185
- Let's start with exhibit A.

25:39.263 --> 25:41.413
Do you recognize this?

25:43.784 --> 25:44.691
- Wait.

25:44.785 --> 25:46.192
Wait a minute.

25:46.270 --> 25:47.545
Is that...
[gasps]

25:47.696 --> 25:49.454
Yes, it is.

25:49.531 --> 25:52.216
Your Honor,
if it please the court,

25:52.443 --> 25:55.970
de facto, this is,
inter alia...

25:57.798 --> 26:02.451
This is a branch from our tree
that Teddy used as a wand.

26:02.469 --> 26:03.802
- [chuckles]
That's right.

26:03.954 --> 26:07.213
One summer, our son was
obsessed with being a wizard.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.566
- He'd collected
all the tree leaves

26:08.717 --> 26:12.795
to make potions because
he said the tree was magic.

26:12.797 --> 26:14.387
- Objection!

26:14.407 --> 26:15.814
It's a twig.

26:15.966 --> 26:19.818
I don't see the sine qua non
to render an adjudication.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.245
- Nice, babe.

26:21.396 --> 26:22.079
- Thanks.

26:22.156 --> 26:24.156
- Overruled.

26:24.232 --> 26:26.250
Exhibit B, please.

26:30.981 --> 26:31.980
- A rock.

26:31.982 --> 26:33.482
How is that helpful?

26:33.484 --> 26:37.094
- It isn't just a rock,
Your Honor.

26:37.245 --> 26:39.079
This marks the spot
where we buried our dog,

26:39.098 --> 26:42.491
Pepper, under the tree.

26:42.493 --> 26:44.250
Pepper was with us
for almost 20 years.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.605
We got him when our oldest
was just a baby.

26:47.681 --> 26:51.257
- Never have a baby and
a puppy at the same time.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.111
But the kids grew up with him.

26:54.188 --> 26:56.280
- They loved him.

26:56.431 --> 26:59.174
- Your Honor,
what is the relevance here?

26:59.193 --> 27:01.510
- Well, these objects
are all pertinent

27:01.528 --> 27:04.179
to their relationship with
the tree that you killed.

27:04.181 --> 27:05.939
- Objection.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.273
Prejudicial.

27:07.351 --> 27:08.867
- You can't object
to the judge.

27:08.944 --> 27:11.962
- I planted that tree for Viv
the first year we moved

27:12.114 --> 27:13.856
into that house 30 years ago.

27:13.858 --> 27:17.450
- Now it's just a stump because
they wanted a dumb pool.

27:17.528 --> 27:19.378
- Which is why
we decided to file

27:19.530 --> 27:25.033
the injunction on the grounds
of res ipsa loquitur.

27:25.127 --> 27:26.718
- Mmm.
- Not bad.

27:26.795 --> 27:28.220
- That's perjury.

27:28.372 --> 27:30.981
Lou doesn't make any
decisions in your home.

27:31.058 --> 27:32.483
- Excuse me?

27:32.634 --> 27:34.710
- The only decision he
ever made was to marry you,

27:34.728 --> 27:36.636
and you haven't let him
make another one since.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.804
- Hearsay.

27:37.898 --> 27:39.973
But that isn't true.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.900
Is it true, Lou?

27:42.052 --> 27:43.827
I--
[gavel thumping]

27:43.904 --> 27:45.070
- Order.

27:45.222 --> 27:47.647
Order in, um--

27:47.667 --> 27:49.057
- [whispering]
Island.

27:49.076 --> 27:51.985
- Island justice.

27:52.062 --> 27:54.296
Let's move to exhibit C,
please.

27:56.658 --> 27:57.991
- Oh.

27:58.068 --> 28:00.569
That's our son
Peter's pocketknife.

28:00.587 --> 28:02.346
He got it when he was
an Eagle Scout.

28:02.497 --> 28:04.330
- Remember we used it
that New Year's Eve

28:04.350 --> 28:06.925
to carve all our initials
into the trunk?

28:07.077 --> 28:09.578
- Yeah,
and Teddy started crying

28:09.580 --> 28:12.648
because he said
we were hurting it.

28:15.419 --> 28:18.086
- I miss it.

28:18.088 --> 28:20.272
- It's not just a tree, is it?

28:20.424 --> 28:22.424
- Uh-uh.

28:22.443 --> 28:24.184
It's all of it.

28:24.261 --> 28:26.945
They're all grown up.

28:27.097 --> 28:29.189
[crying]
I miss all of it.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.117
- You never talk
about this stuff.

28:32.194 --> 28:35.954
- Because it's
too painful, Lou.

28:36.031 --> 28:39.591
[sobbing]

28:40.945 --> 28:42.778
- That can't be real, right?

28:42.780 --> 28:45.447
- Maybe they're
crocodile tears.

28:45.466 --> 28:48.617
- It seems to me
like Vivian's anger

28:48.619 --> 28:52.563
was covering up
a whole lot of sadness.

28:56.961 --> 29:00.362
[sobbing continues]

29:07.395 --> 29:09.062
- They really turned on
the waterworks.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.249
We gotta do the same.

29:12.476 --> 29:14.334
- We'll just tell the truth.

29:15.813 --> 29:16.979
- Oh.

29:16.997 --> 29:19.423
[indistinct whispering]

29:19.500 --> 29:20.740
[clears throat]

29:20.760 --> 29:21.833
All rise.

29:21.910 --> 29:23.409
Court is back in session.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.263
- Oh, that's really
not necessary.

29:26.414 --> 29:27.931
- Oh.
- Seth and Natalie.

29:28.008 --> 29:29.725
You're up.

29:38.168 --> 29:41.403
I call your attention
to exhibit one for the Roses.

29:45.934 --> 29:47.433
- That's not ours.

29:47.511 --> 29:49.453
- It's mine.

29:49.604 --> 29:51.847
From when I was a baby.

29:51.865 --> 29:53.348
- I object.

29:53.367 --> 29:56.184
Baby hats are adorable,
and therefore manipulative.

29:56.203 --> 29:57.853
- Motion to strike
the baby hat.

29:57.855 --> 29:59.871
- Motion denied.

30:00.024 --> 30:04.468
- My mom saved it
for our future baby.

30:04.545 --> 30:06.878
It's green, so she said
it wouldn't matter

30:07.031 --> 30:10.365
if we had a boy or a girl.

30:10.367 --> 30:13.477
I didn't think
we'd end up with neither.

30:15.689 --> 30:18.206
- But we haven't given up hope.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.709
- It's why we started
building the pool.

30:20.711 --> 30:23.378
- If you build it,
they will come.

30:23.397 --> 30:26.381
And with so many
disappointments,

30:26.400 --> 30:28.992
we needed to focus on
something positive.

30:29.144 --> 30:33.905
- We were manifesting future
pool parties for the kids.

30:34.058 --> 30:36.149
Family barbecues.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.152
Birthday celebrations.

30:39.246 --> 30:41.154
- They robbed us of that.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.065
- That is
a mischaracterization.

30:43.067 --> 30:44.566
- Our backyard
is a torn-up mud pit.

30:44.568 --> 30:46.659
- It caused
even more anxiety...

30:46.737 --> 30:50.589
- Which doesn't help when you
are trying to have a baby.

30:50.665 --> 30:52.474
- Let's go to exhibit two.

30:57.764 --> 31:02.175
- [gasps]
Oh, those are lovely!

31:02.194 --> 31:04.969
Oh, yeah.
We had a set just like them.

31:05.122 --> 31:06.530
- Us too.
- Oh.

31:06.607 --> 31:08.866
- We got these from
Maria and Steve

31:09.017 --> 31:10.108
when they bought their house.

31:10.185 --> 31:11.869
- And Vanessa and Amy too.

31:11.945 --> 31:15.038
- Everyone just started
moving to the suburbs.

31:15.190 --> 31:17.040
Having kids.

31:17.159 --> 31:19.192
Felt like the next step.

31:19.286 --> 31:20.769
- Because you wanted it to be,

31:20.787 --> 31:23.121
or because
you felt it should be?

31:23.198 --> 31:24.530
- Your Honor,
my wife wants kids

31:24.608 --> 31:26.199
more than anything
in this world.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.460
- Objection.
That's a lie.

31:28.612 --> 31:29.720
- What are you talking about?

31:29.947 --> 31:31.371
- You're the one who wants
to have kids so much.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.632
Natalie just doesn't
want to disappoint you.

31:33.784 --> 31:35.467
- You're the liar.

31:35.619 --> 31:37.227
And I'll remind you,
you're still under oath.

31:37.304 --> 31:39.045
And how would you know that,
anyway?

31:39.123 --> 31:42.065
- She told me.
- She told you when?

31:42.142 --> 31:44.309
- [sighs]

31:44.461 --> 31:48.238
- During one of our
Sunday golf games.

31:49.891 --> 31:52.300
- You golf with him?

31:52.394 --> 31:55.495
- He's a surprisingly
good listener.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.066
- Yeah, you'd have to be
with a wife like that.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.401
But to golf?
With him?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.253
- I didn't know about
the injunctions then.

32:03.330 --> 32:05.088
- I thought you played golf
with Arthur.

32:05.165 --> 32:06.982
- I do, just not on Sunday.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.075
She golfed in college.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.670
And--and doesn't she
remind you of Abby?

32:11.822 --> 32:14.172
- Our daughter?

32:14.249 --> 32:16.683
- She really improved my game.

32:19.087 --> 32:22.013
- Exhibit three, please.

32:22.090 --> 32:25.108
- [laughing]

32:26.353 --> 32:30.839
Honey, these are the matches
from that diner

32:30.899 --> 32:33.024
where we had our first date.

32:33.177 --> 32:35.360
- It was a great date.

32:35.437 --> 32:36.678
- Yeah.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.790
We got our first place
two blocks from there.

32:39.941 --> 32:42.292
Not big--
- But big enough.

32:42.444 --> 32:44.944
We didn't need a lot of space.
[chuckles]

32:44.964 --> 32:46.112
- Ah.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.632
- We had the city.

32:48.783 --> 32:50.358
And each other.

32:50.377 --> 32:54.454
And our dreams for the future.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.789
<i> [soft music]</i>
