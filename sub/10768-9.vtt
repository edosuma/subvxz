15:48.000 --> 15:50.300
Hey, man, where'd you get
this from anyway?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.000
I stole it.

16:00.900 --> 16:05.100
Will. I'm glad you finally decided
to call me.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.300
Yeah, I figured we needed to,
you know, talk about what happened.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.800
Yeah, definitely.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.800
Um, go ahead.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.800
- What?
- Talk.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.600
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, listen.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.000
Maybe we should have
a cappuccino first, you know.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.300
Just to warm up to our conversation.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.600
- Sure.
- All right.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.200
Hey, man, who you shov...?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.800
All right, this is a stickup.
Everyone on the floor!

16:38.000 --> 16:39.400
[SCREAMS]

16:40.600 --> 16:44.000
Don't anyone try to be a hero.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.900
Let's have the cash, Webster.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.800
Fine, take the money. But then what?

16:56.000 --> 17:00.200
Holed up in some fleabag motel waiting
for the man to come and take you away.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.800
And all that's left is to walk that last
long, lonely mile with the Lord's Prayer...

17:05.000 --> 17:07.900
Will you give the man
the damn money?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.500
All right, get down. Don't you move.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.599
- All right, it's showtime.
- What?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.300
All right, buddy,
you ain't going nowhere.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.400
Will, don't be a fool.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.099
I'm warning you, pal,
this thing is loaded.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.400
Hey, look, point it right at me.
Make it look real.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.599
Huh?

17:26.700 --> 17:28.400
[WILL YELLS]

17:39.600 --> 17:42.300
I said, "Hyah!"

17:51.900 --> 17:53.300
Thank you, thank you.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.900
Lisa, come stand by my side.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.000
Will, that was the most foolish thing I've
ever seen. You could have been killed.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.600
- No, but, baby... Baby...
LISA: No.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.400
Jazz, you can take your fake cop.
Lisa left.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.800
Will, he's real.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.100
And so is he.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.200
And all that for only 40 bucks?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.800
Hey, Uncle Phil, what's up, man?
You busy?

18:24.900 --> 18:26.800
Yes, I am.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.800
Listen. Uncle Phil,
I've been acting real dumb.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.200
Mm-hm.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.000
Look, I know what you thinking,
what's new?

18:37.200 --> 18:42.100
But usually I know why I be tripping,
man, but this time I don't have no clue.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.900
This is about you and Lisa, isn't it?

18:45.400 --> 18:47.200
Sit down, Will.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.600
You know, ever since
the dawn of civilization...

18:50.800 --> 18:53.500
...man has tried to be
the stronger of the species.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.000
The hunter, the protector.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.000
Have you taken any
anthropology classes?

18:58.500 --> 19:01.800
<i>Well, no, but I seen The Flintstones,
like, five times.</i>

19:03.700 --> 19:05.800
Anyway, let me update this for you.

19:05.900 --> 19:09.500
Say a stranger asks you for directions.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.800
Now, you don't know where it is,
but do you say that? No.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.800
You say, "Go down three blocks,
make a left, you can't miss it. "

19:18.700 --> 19:22.700
Yeah. I got plenty of dudes
out there still looking for places.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.600
Same guy asks a woman.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.800
Now, she doesn't know either.

19:28.900 --> 19:32.100
But she says, "I don't know. "

19:32.200 --> 19:33.400
Pfft.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.000
That's the difference
between men and women.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.400
Wait, wait, wait, Uncle Phil.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.400
What is it that makes men
act like that?

19:41.500 --> 19:44.400
It's testosterone, the male hormone.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.500
And women don't have testosterone?

19:47.200 --> 19:52.700
Well, I believe they do,
but theirs is dormant most of the time.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.100
- Excuse me.
- Wait, wait. Uncle Phil, hold on.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.000
You don't know the answer to none of
these questions I'm asking you, do you?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.700
No, I guess I don't.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.800
Then why didn't you just say so?

20:07.100 --> 20:09.600
Because I'm a man. Hmph.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.800
Hey, thanks a lot, Carlton.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.500
Hey, Lisa.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.600
Shouldn't you be out fighting crime?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.300
Listen, can I sit down?

20:26.500 --> 20:30.000
No, Will, I don't think so.
You're too crazy for me.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.400
No, I'm crazy about you.
There's a difference.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.100
Look, Lisa, that's the only reason I had
that guy fake sticking up the place.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.100
Only a real robber came in.
I thought it was the setup dude.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.300
Otherwise, I'd have been
up under the table with you.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.400
Will, what exactly were you
trying to accomplish?

20:49.500 --> 20:53.000
- Honestly?
- Yes, please tell me.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.000
I was trying to fight Akira's dragon.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.700
Only the dragon was from without.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.600
Without what?

21:09.300 --> 21:12.800
That's the same place the whole thing
fell apart for me too.

21:14.200 --> 21:19.200
Look, I think I could be cool with you
being able to kick butt all over the city...

21:19.400 --> 21:22.100
...but I got a feeling you got
some other strengths too.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.200
And, you know, that's the part
that kind of scares me.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.700
Will, just because I'm strong,
it doesn't make you weak.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.500
- I ain't never said I was weak.
- No.

21:34.300 --> 21:38.000
Look, why don't we just think
of ourselves as being equals?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Cool.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.900
But you know if we had the same job,
I'm gonna still make more money.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.500
Will you just shut up and kiss me?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.900
Yes'm.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.900
Get a room.

21:59.900 --> 22:03.300
