ANNOUNCER: <i>In the last episode
of</i> Soap, <i>Jessica told Chester</i>

00:05.572 --> 00:07.072
<i>she'd like him to move back home</i>

00:07.073 --> 00:08.574
<i>while she's</i>
<i>in the hospital sick.</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:10.075
<i>Burt was elected sheriff,</i>

00:10.076 --> 00:12.077
<i>which was sickening news</i>
<i>for Sheriff Prentiss,</i>

00:12.078 --> 00:13.579
<i>who did a very sick thing</i>

00:13.580 --> 00:15.080
<i>and said he won't</i>
<i>give up his office</i>

00:15.081 --> 00:16.582
<i>and won't be taken alive,</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:18.083
<i>which means</i>
<i>Burt has to take him,</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:20.586
<i>and that news made Mary</i>
<i>pretty sick.</i>

00:20.587 --> 00:21.587
<i>In the custody battle,</i>

00:21.588 --> 00:24.590
<i>Carol did a sickening thing</i>
<i>by lying on the stand,</i>

00:24.591 --> 00:26.091
<i>and the judge made it</i>
<i>pretty clear</i>

00:26.092 --> 00:28.093
<i>that Mallu's tactics</i>
<i>make her sick,</i>

00:28.094 --> 00:29.094
<i>and both those things</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:30.596
<i>make Jodie's case</i>
<i>look kind of sick,</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:32.598
<i>which certainly</i>
<i>makes Jodie sick,</i>

00:32.598 --> 00:34.600
<i>and Jessica's doctor</i>
<i>told Chester</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:36.101
<i>that Jessica is a sick woman.</i>

00:36.102 --> 00:40.606
<i>We don't know exactly how sick,</i>
<i>but we do know very sick.</i>

00:40.607 --> 00:44.110
<i>Sick? You won't be</i>
<i>after this episode of</i> Soap.

00:48.114 --> 00:51.116
<i>This is story of two sisters,</i>

00:51.117 --> 00:53.118
<i>Jessica Tate</i>

00:53.119 --> 00:55.621
<i>and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:55.622 --> 00:59.124
<i>These are the Tates,</i>

00:59.125 --> 01:03.128
<i>and these are the Campbells,</i>

01:03.129 --> 01:05.631
<i>and this is</i> Soap.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:47.674 --> 01:49.174
Oh, thank God. Oh!

01:49.175 --> 01:50.175
Burt...

01:50.176 --> 01:51.176
Jo...

01:51.177 --> 01:53.679
Is, uh, fine.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.183
I can really
brighten your day, can't I?

01:58.184 --> 01:59.685
Well, I'm, uh...

01:59.686 --> 02:00.686
It's, uh...

02:00.687 --> 02:02.187
He, uh...

02:02.188 --> 02:03.689
So did, uh...

02:03.690 --> 02:05.691
I'm, uh... Coffee?

02:05.692 --> 02:07.693
Hey... Are you okay?

02:07.694 --> 02:09.696
Oh, su...

02:11.197 --> 02:12.698
Ma, something's wrong.

02:12.699 --> 02:13.699
I know your signs.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.201
Loss of emotional control,
hysteria.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.703
It's subtle, but I can see it.

02:17.704 --> 02:18.704
Now, Ma, what's wrong?

02:18.705 --> 02:20.706
Jo...

02:20.707 --> 02:22.207
Bu...

02:22.208 --> 02:23.709
He...

02:23.710 --> 02:24.710
Bu...

02:24.711 --> 02:25.711
They...

02:25.712 --> 02:26.712
Bu...

02:26.713 --> 02:29.715
I know. I know.
I know.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.716
Ma, it's Wendy.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.217
Wendy, no.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.719
Yes, Ma, I know, but listen,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.220
there's not much we can do.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.221
You just have to have faith.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.222
Look at this,

02:37.223 --> 02:38.724
I came over here all depressed

02:38.725 --> 02:40.225
hoping to get one of your
famous pep talks,

02:40.226 --> 02:42.728
and I end up
giving one to myself.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.229
I know it doesn't look good, Ma,

02:44.230 --> 02:45.731
but don't cry, huh?

02:45.732 --> 02:47.733
That's not why I'm crying.

02:47.734 --> 02:51.737
Oh, too bad, it was
a hell of a speech.

02:51.738 --> 02:52.738
What's wrong?

02:52.739 --> 02:53.739
It's Burt.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.741
The election.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.243
I'm so wrapped up in the trial
I don't even know what happened.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.244
He lost, huh?

02:59.245 --> 03:00.746
He won.

03:00.747 --> 03:01.747
He won.
Well, that's great.

03:01.748 --> 03:02.748
Oh, yeah, great.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.250
Sheriff Prentiss
won't give up the office.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.753
He's sworn
he won't be taken alive.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.255
What a bad loser.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.757
Burt and Danny
went to get him out.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.759
What are they, crazy?
Are they out of their minds?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.761
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go help them.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.262
What are you, crazy?
You out of your mind?

03:17.263 --> 03:18.764
Ma!

03:18.765 --> 03:19.765
Success!

03:19.766 --> 03:23.268
Oh, Burt! Burt!

03:23.269 --> 03:26.271
Oh, Danny.

03:26.272 --> 03:27.773
All right, Mare.
Mare, come on,

03:27.774 --> 03:28.774
it was nothing.
I told you not...

03:28.775 --> 03:30.776
I told you there was
nothing to worry about,

03:30.777 --> 03:32.277
right? Told you.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.278
You weren't worried, were you?

03:33.279 --> 03:35.781
Well, I was a little worried.

03:35.782 --> 03:38.784
How could you do this to me?

03:38.785 --> 03:39.785
Mary...

03:39.786 --> 03:41.286
Mary, what is this?
Now, stop.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.287
You should've seen him, Jodie.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.289
He was beautiful.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.290
What is the matter with you?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.291
Mary, what are you doing?

03:46.292 --> 03:47.292
All right, this is...

03:47.293 --> 03:50.796
What is...? What...?
Why are you hitting?

03:50.797 --> 03:53.298
Why am I hitting?

03:53.299 --> 03:55.300
I am hitting
because I have a child in here

03:55.301 --> 03:58.303
who would like to see you alive,
Burt Campbell.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.805
Mare. Now,
Mare, please.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.306
All right, listen to me.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.307
Just listen to me, all right?

04:02.308 --> 04:05.310
Now, like it or not,
that's my job.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.813
I am a sheriff.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.314
You happen to be married
to a sheriff.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.817
Now, whatever I have to do
to do my job, I'll do,

04:11.818 --> 04:12.818
and whatever you have to do

04:12.819 --> 04:14.820
to keep from going crazy
while I do my job,

04:14.821 --> 04:15.822
that you've gotta do.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.824
Now, Mare, I know you're
scared and frightened,

04:18.825 --> 04:20.826
and I don't want to hear
any more about that.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.328
I used to walk around
all day long on a girder.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.830
That never bothered you.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.333
I used to walk all day
underneath girders,

04:28.334 --> 04:30.836
with guys dropping hot bolts
from 40 stories up.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.838
That never bothered you.
Forty stories, Mary.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.339
That goes right through
the hard hat,

04:34.340 --> 04:35.340
pfft,

04:35.341 --> 04:36.842
winds up in your shorts.

04:38.344 --> 04:39.344
Are you crazy?

04:39.345 --> 04:40.846
Are you out of your mind?

04:40.847 --> 04:41.847
Listen, Bob, don't holler at me.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.348
You are the one that blew it.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.850
Oh, I blew it?
You blew it.

04:44.851 --> 04:45.851
I didn't blow it.

04:45.852 --> 04:46.852
Yeah, you blew it.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.854
They seem to be at a standoff

04:48.855 --> 04:50.355
as to who blew it.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.857
Right in the middle
of an audition,

04:51.858 --> 04:54.359
Bob starts telling
the filthiest joke

04:54.360 --> 04:55.861
I have ever heard in my life.

05:00.867 --> 05:04.369
This lady walks into a bar
with Ed Sullivan and a duck.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.872
Not now, please.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.875
Please, guys.
Later, please.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.877
Hey, Burt. Hey, I'm glad
to see you're alive.

05:11.878 --> 05:12.878
Thank you.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.881
Oh, Jodie, I am so upset.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.382
Don't worry, there'll
be other auditions.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.384
Not about that, you dummy.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.887
It about our little...

05:21.888 --> 05:24.389
Well, it's about our little...

05:24.390 --> 05:26.892
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy...

05:26.893 --> 05:27.893
Bob. Bob, come on.

05:27.894 --> 05:31.897
If we lose her, I don't know...

05:31.898 --> 05:35.400
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

05:35.401 --> 05:38.403
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy!

05:43.409 --> 05:44.409
Come on, Bob.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.911
I'll take you upstairs.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.412
I'll get you a tranquilizer.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.914
Oh, Wendy...

05:53.920 --> 05:56.422
Poor guy, he's beside himself.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.929
You just talked him out of it?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.430
Who?

06:05.431 --> 06:07.432
Oh, Prentiss! Yeah,
Sheriff Prentiss.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.433
Mare, it was incredible.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.935
It was unbelievable.

06:09.936 --> 06:10.936
I mean, I knew.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.938
I knew we were
gonna be okay, so...

06:12.939 --> 06:13.939
It's true, Ma.
It's true.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.440
He kept saying over and over,

06:15.441 --> 06:16.942
"It's fine.
We're gonna be fine,"

06:16.943 --> 06:18.443
and we were.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.446
It was like he had this
mystical, magical power

06:21.447 --> 06:22.447
or something.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.448
So, I mean, I knew.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.450
I knew that he wouldn't
shoot me, so...

06:25.451 --> 06:26.451
So he walks in,

06:26.452 --> 06:28.453
he pours himself
a cup of coffee,

06:28.454 --> 06:29.955
he sits down.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.457
So I said...
I'll never forget what you said to him.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.458
I said...

06:33.459 --> 06:36.962
"Sooner or later you're gonna
have to come out of there.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.965
And why hurt other people
in the process?"

06:39.966 --> 06:41.967
And that was the end of it.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.468
That's fantastic.

06:43.469 --> 06:47.472
Yeah, I thought I told it
pretty well.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.976
Yes, really,
really terrific there.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.477
Thanks, Burt.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.479
I'm so glad you're back.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
I'll get you something to eat.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.982
Hey...

06:56.983 --> 06:58.483
Hey, what?

06:58.484 --> 06:59.985
Hey, you.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.488
I love you.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.990
I love you too...

07:06.993 --> 07:09.494
big jerk.

07:09.495 --> 07:10.996
Well, I'm gonna go wash up.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.999
Boy, I love that!

07:14.000 --> 07:15.500
"I'm gonna go wash up."

07:15.501 --> 07:18.003
Day is done,
Sheriff Burt got his man,

07:18.004 --> 07:21.006
and now he's gonna wash up.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.008
I love that.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.010
Danny?

07:25.011 --> 07:26.011
Yeah, Burt.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.514
Shut up.

07:29.515 --> 07:30.515
Okay, Burt.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.017
Huh?

07:32.018 --> 07:33.519
I love that.

07:38.524 --> 07:39.524
Ma, I gotta go.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.526
Jodie, please don't go.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.529
Uh... I need
to talk to you.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.532
It's... the baby.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.034
Ma, I'm doing
everything I can do.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.535
I can't do any more than that.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.037
Oh, I know, Jodie.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.038
I'm so proud of you.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.040
I'm not talking about your baby.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.042
I'm talking about my baby.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.044
What's wrong?

08:02.548 --> 08:04.549
It may not be Burt's.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.551
Ma! I can't...

08:06.552 --> 08:10.555
Jodie, I didn't do anything,
I swear.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.057
It was his double.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.558
I slept with his double.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.060
I didn't know it was his double.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.061
I thought it was him.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.063
But they looked
exactly alike, right?

08:18.064 --> 08:21.567
That's mainly why I didn't know.

08:22.528 --> 08:23.568
But when the baby is born,

08:23.569 --> 08:25.570
and it looks like it came
from both of you,

08:25.571 --> 08:27.072
what's the difference?

08:27.073 --> 08:28.573
What's the problem?

08:28.574 --> 08:32.077
Because, if it's an alien...

08:32.078 --> 08:35.080
If it's an alien baby,

08:35.081 --> 08:41.087
there is a great possibility
he'll be silver and very short.

08:49.595 --> 08:52.598
Burt's actually fairly tall.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.103
Well, I'm having a baby.

08:58.104 --> 09:01.106
I suppose I should
count my blessings.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.107
Sure, Ma.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.608
I mean, it's not like
the alien father

09:03.609 --> 09:06.111
is going to want
the baby for weekends.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.113
You know what a schlep
that would be?

09:21.127 --> 09:24.629
Oh, my God!

09:24.630 --> 09:27.132
Why her? Why Jessica?

09:28.634 --> 09:30.635
Dutch, would you please relax.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.637
Mom will be fine, really.

09:32.638 --> 09:35.640
Well, I'm eating, Corinne,
but I ain't enjoying it.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.642
It's no reflection
on you, Sandy.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.644
This stuff is aces.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.646
Oh, what a relief.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.649
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.651
Hey, pal, if you ain't
gonna finish that,

09:46.652 --> 09:49.154
you can pass it down here, okay?

09:49.155 --> 09:51.657
Would you care for a shovel?

09:55.161 --> 09:56.162
I'm home, kids.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.164
Daddy's home.

10:03.669 --> 10:04.669
Dutch?

10:04.670 --> 10:07.172
What are we gonna to do,
big guy?

10:07.173 --> 10:09.674
What are we gonna do?

10:09.675 --> 10:11.676
What's the matter with him?

10:11.677 --> 10:13.678
He's upset about Mother.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.181
And I'm not, is that it?

10:16.182 --> 10:18.184
Nobody said you weren't upset.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.187
Saunders,
I'll have my dinner, please.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.190
I'm awfully sorry,
but dinner is over.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.193
Saunders, I just got here.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.697
Yes, I see, but you were tardy.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.200
I'm hungry.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.702
More of an incentive
to be on time.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.704
Can't you whip up
something, for God's sake?

10:39.705 --> 10:41.206
Whip up?

10:41.207 --> 10:44.209
This isn't a chuck wagon.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.211
I prepare. I create.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.712
I'm proud of what I serve,

10:47.713 --> 10:49.714
but never, ever,
under any condition,

10:49.715 --> 10:51.717
do I "whip up."

10:53.219 --> 10:54.719
I live here.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.722
Only temporarily.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.225
I am your employer, Saunders.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.228
Actually,
Mrs. Tate is my employer.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.229
Under her specifications,

11:04.230 --> 11:06.231
I am to serve
only family and guests.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.734
You are neither.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.238
Could I have a little
tiny taste of that,

11:13.239 --> 11:14.399
if it's not too much trouble?

11:19.245 --> 11:21.246
Welcome home, Colonel.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.247
Major...

11:22.248 --> 11:23.249
Sit.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.753
We thought you were dead.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.255
Hope springs eternal.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.759
When did you escape
from your foxhole?

11:34.760 --> 11:36.761
When the fox threw him out.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.264
All right, that's enough.

11:40.766 --> 11:41.766
I have made mistakes

11:41.767 --> 11:44.269
that I will have to live with
the rest of my life,

11:44.270 --> 11:46.271
but no one on this earth
loves your mother

11:46.272 --> 11:47.272
more than I do.

11:47.273 --> 11:51.276
Oh, my God, I can't stand it.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.279
Well, let's put an end
to all this squabbling.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.780
It's petty and pointless,

11:55.781 --> 11:57.782
and let's not forget
your mother is in the hospital,

11:57.783 --> 11:59.784
and we have to remain strong
for her.

11:59.785 --> 12:03.288
I know, but I don't think
I can do that!

12:03.289 --> 12:04.790
Dutch!

12:08.794 --> 12:10.795
We've all made mistakes
in our lives,

12:10.796 --> 12:12.297
every one of us,

12:12.298 --> 12:13.798
but we've gotten through them.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.300
We're a family, for God's sake.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.302
Let's try to act like on.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.804
You're right, Daddy.
I'm sorry.

12:19.805 --> 12:20.805
I'm sorry too, Dad.

12:20.806 --> 12:23.308
May I say something?

12:23.309 --> 12:25.310
Go ahead, Gramps.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.314
I think I'm sitting
on a squirrel.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.815
All right.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.317
This time
I'm really gonna do it!

12:32.318 --> 12:33.318
Leslie!

12:33.319 --> 12:35.320
Oh, don't you "Leslie" me.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.822
When I put these two wires
together, I'm going up.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.324
We're all going up.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.326
We're all gonna be blown
sky high!

12:41.327 --> 12:42.327
Leslie, no.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.828
Oh, stay away from me.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.331
Everybody say your prayers.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.332
Goodbye.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.338
SINGERS:
♪ <i>WGGB... ♪</i>

12:56.842 --> 12:58.343
Leslie...

12:58.344 --> 12:59.344
Billy, wait.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.346
Don't worry, Daddy,
he'll be okay.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.347
Did you see that?

13:02.348 --> 13:04.849
Did he ask to be excused?

13:04.850 --> 13:06.851
Is that the way a person
leaves the table?

13:06.852 --> 13:10.355
I don't know what's got into
young people these days.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.357
I couldn't agree with you more.

13:12.358 --> 13:17.362
Any Cub Scout could see
it's not these wires.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.364
It's these wires.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.365
Major, don't!

13:35.381 --> 13:38.384
Is it autumn already?

13:52.398 --> 13:53.898
All right, this is me

13:53.899 --> 13:57.902
when I got out of reform school.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.404
Did you have a beard?

13:59.405 --> 14:01.906
No, I was biting the top
of the other guy's head.

14:01.907 --> 14:02.907
See?

14:02.908 --> 14:04.409
Oh...

14:04.410 --> 14:05.910
This is me in the Navy.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.412
This is me
in the Naval stockade.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.914
You've had some life, Dutch.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.917
Yeah. I must be
the luckiest guy in the world.

14:12.918 --> 14:13.918
First, Eunice takes me in

14:13.919 --> 14:15.420
and makes me a part
of the family,

14:15.421 --> 14:18.923
and then she dumps me,
and then you take me in.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.425
I love you, Corinne.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.927
I love you, Dutch.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.430
Who is it?

14:25.431 --> 14:26.431
It's Eunice.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.933
Eu... Eu...

14:28.934 --> 14:30.936
Get down.
Get down.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.443
Hiya.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.944
Oh, Corinne, I'm back.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.446
I'm back.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.948
Yes, you are. You're back.

14:43.949 --> 14:44.949
Oh, I heard about Mother,

14:44.950 --> 14:47.452
and I came as fast as I could.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.454
Are you happy to see me?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.956
Happy is not the word.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.458
Oh, Corinne, where's Dutch?

14:53.459 --> 14:55.960
Oh, he'll turn up eventually.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.462
What's that?

14:57.463 --> 14:58.463
What's what?

14:58.464 --> 14:59.464
The lump.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.465
What lump?

15:00.466 --> 15:01.966
That lump there.
This lump.

15:01.967 --> 15:02.967
Oh, you mean this lump.

15:02.968 --> 15:03.968
What is it?

15:03.969 --> 15:04.969
Uh, Rolf.

15:04.970 --> 15:05.970
Who?

15:05.971 --> 15:07.972
I have a dog, Rolf.

15:07.973 --> 15:08.973
Speak, Rolf.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.476
DUTCH:
Woof! Woof!

15:13.979 --> 15:15.480
Dutch!

15:15.481 --> 15:16.982
Woof!

15:20.486 --> 15:21.986
Eunice, what are you doing here?

15:21.987 --> 15:25.490
Well, I suppose I don't have
to ask what you're doing here.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.493
Eunice, it's, uh,
not how it looks.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.994
What?

15:29.995 --> 15:31.996
My boyfriend is in bed
with my sister,

15:31.997 --> 15:33.998
he's going, "Woof! Woof!"
under the sheets,

15:33.999 --> 15:35.500
and it's not how it looks?

15:35.501 --> 15:38.503
What was he doing under there,
hiding a bone?

15:38.504 --> 15:42.507
No, you see...

15:42.508 --> 15:44.008
I... I...

15:44.009 --> 15:46.010
N-n-n...
Not now, Dutch.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.011
Listen, Eunice,

15:47.012 --> 15:48.012
you have a lot of nerve

15:48.013 --> 15:49.514
coming in here being appalled.

15:49.515 --> 15:50.515
I have a lot of nerve?

15:50.516 --> 15:52.517
My sister steals away
my boyfriend.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.018
Steals away?

15:54.019 --> 15:55.520
You ran out on him!

15:55.521 --> 15:57.522
Well, are you calling me
a hussy?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.023
You're calling me a hussy,
aren't you, Corinne?

15:59.024 --> 16:00.024
Go ahead and say it.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.027
My own sister, Corinne,
calls me a hussy.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.028
Go on, say it.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.029
Excuse me.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.531
Later, darling.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.533
Okay. Okay,
you want to get ugly,

16:08.534 --> 16:09.534
let's get ugly.

16:09.535 --> 16:10.535
Excuse me.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.536
You are ugly.

16:11.537 --> 16:12.537
Oh, yeah?

16:12.538 --> 16:13.538
Yeah!

16:13.539 --> 16:16.040
Shut up!

16:16.041 --> 16:19.043
Eunice, what the hell
are you doing here?

16:19.044 --> 16:21.546
Dutch...

16:21.547 --> 16:24.048
I ran away
because I was so frightened.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.551
I loved you so much
it frightened me,

16:26.552 --> 16:29.554
and the more I loved you,
the more frightened I got,

16:29.555 --> 16:31.556
and so, in order
not to be frightened,

16:31.557 --> 16:34.058
I had to stop loving you,
and so I ran away, and...

16:34.059 --> 16:39.063
Oh, Dutch, now
I'm so frightened.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.566
I'm so frightened of losing you.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.569
Stable girl.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.072
Please, take me back.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.073
I can't.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.074
Oh, what?

16:50.075 --> 16:51.075
What did she tell you?

16:51.076 --> 16:52.076
You were great or something,

16:52.077 --> 16:53.578
or that the earth
moved. What?

16:53.579 --> 16:55.079
Eunice!

16:55.080 --> 16:57.081
You know, she fakes it, Dutch.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.583
She has always faked it.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.586
I never faked it in my life.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.588
Come on, Corinne.
You told me the story

17:03.589 --> 17:05.589
about the president
of the audio-visual department.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.592
Eunice, would you mind
getting out of my room, please.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.093
And leave you alone with him?

17:09.094 --> 17:10.094
No way.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.096
How's he gonna make
an unbiased decision

17:12.097 --> 17:13.097
sleeping here with you?

17:13.098 --> 17:15.599
Well, he's certainly not
sleeping with you.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.101
Well, so I'll sleep here too.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.604
With both of us?
Forget it.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.106
Well, if I gotta, I gotta.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.609
No, you sleep here, and Corinne,

17:25.611 --> 17:27.612
you'll sleep with me in my room.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.614
Is that okay with you, Dutch?

17:29.615 --> 17:34.619
No, but I guess there ain't
no other solution, huh?

17:34.620 --> 17:39.123
We'll see you in the morning.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.625
Okay.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.128
Good night, Dutch.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.129
Good night, Dutch.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.691
Good night, Eunice.
Good night, Corinne.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.635
I'll sneak in later.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.142
I'll sneak in later.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.662
It's gonna be
a beautiful day out today.

18:17.663 --> 18:18.663
Oh...

18:18.664 --> 18:21.666
What I don't understand is

18:21.667 --> 18:26.170
why everyone has to get up
at 6:00 in the morning.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.172
I mean, you'd think
we had somewhere to go.

18:28.173 --> 18:30.174
We serve breakfast at 6.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.178
I don't need breakfast.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.681
I haven't eaten breakfast
since I got here.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.683
Well, we also give out
the medicine at 6.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.685
I'm not on medication.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.688
The doctors want you up at 6.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.690
Why? They don't
get here till 10.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.693
At 6:00,
the doctors are home sleeping.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.695
I'm gonna go back to sleep now.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.699
Put in a wake-up call
for me please, at 11:00.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.703
Hi.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.204
Hi.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.206
Would you excuse us, please.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.208
What are you doing here?

19:04.209 --> 19:05.710
I work here.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.712
You should be home sleeping.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.213
That's what I told
the kidney stone

19:09.214 --> 19:10.715
that came in a few hours ago.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.718
So that's how you
refer to us, huh?

19:13.719 --> 19:16.721
The kidney stone,
the gallbladder, the spleen.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.722
What am I?

19:17.723 --> 19:19.725
The gorgeous redhead.

19:21.727 --> 19:22.727
How do you feel?

19:22.728 --> 19:25.229
Tired.
They don't let me sleep here.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.230
How do you feel?

19:26.231 --> 19:28.733
Tired.
They don't let me sleep either.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.235
You know, this is going to seem

19:31.236 --> 19:32.236
pretty silly to you,

19:32.237 --> 19:34.739
but I thought
I was your only patient.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.743
It's because
you make me feel that way.

19:38.744 --> 19:42.748
Well, you're very special.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.255
You got something on your mind?

19:52.257 --> 19:55.259
Well, yes, I do.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.762
W-wait a minute. Don't...

19:57.763 --> 20:00.765
Don't say anything.

20:00.766 --> 20:05.771
Just give me a few more seconds
of immortality.

20:14.279 --> 20:19.784
I think you were about
to tell me I'm going to die.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.287
It's a new strain of virus,

20:23.288 --> 20:26.290
and we just don't know
how to combat it yet.

20:26.291 --> 20:29.293
How fast can you learn?

20:29.294 --> 20:31.796
Not fast enough.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.302
Hmm...

20:38.303 --> 20:40.304
I feel like I'm in a movie,

20:40.305 --> 20:42.807
and any minute, they're going
to start playing the music.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.810
You're being very calm.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.312
Don't worry.

20:48.313 --> 20:50.314
When I'm alone, I'll fall apart.

20:50.315 --> 20:52.817
You know, you can
fall apart now.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.318
Oh, no, I couldn't.

20:54.319 --> 20:58.823
My mascara would run.
I'd look like a raccoon.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.830
How much time do I have?

21:05.831 --> 21:07.832
Not much.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.836
Till lunch?

21:12.337 --> 21:15.339
You have a maximum
of a few weeks

21:15.340 --> 21:16.841
or as little as a few days.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.346
That's not enough time.

21:22.347 --> 21:25.349
You see, there's so much
that I have to do.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.852
There are people
that I have to apologize to

21:27.853 --> 21:29.854
and friends to say goodbye to.

21:29.855 --> 21:33.859
I haven't seen
<i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> yet.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.365
It's not fair.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.367
I know.

21:43.368 --> 21:46.370
I mean, I finally
replace Benson,

21:46.371 --> 21:49.874
and now I'm gonna die.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.877
I'm so sorry, Jessica.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.879
I'm so terribly, terribly sorry.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.883
Oh, it's not your fault.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.886
This is never easy,

22:01.887 --> 22:05.389
but this time,
it's especially hard.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.392
Someone with your kindness
and grace

22:08.393 --> 22:10.395
should be allowed
to stay forever.

22:14.900 --> 22:22.900
Well... a while longer
would have been nice.

22:22.908 --> 22:26.410
Listen, you'd better go now.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.413
You've got sick people
to take care of.

22:29.414 --> 22:32.417
Ones you can help.

22:34.419 --> 22:35.420
I'll come back later.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.923
Well, I'll be here.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.426
Not going to get rid of me yet.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.430
I'll see you later.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.935
You're a brave lady.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.474
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will Leslie ever learn to kill herself?</i>

23:30.475 --> 23:31.976

23:34.479 --> 23:35.479
