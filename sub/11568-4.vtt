00:48.115 --> 00:50.349
Oh, (BLEEP) you, Fred.
Just (BLEEP) yourself.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.451
You're not half
the angler I am.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.954
There's no way you caught
all those giant fish without
doin' something sneaky,

Why don't you hit those S's
a little harder there, Bill.

-Easy there!
-You're not gonna

You mean Fred Cheater?

02:17.505 --> 02:19.037
Yeah, that's right, I said it.

Say, you ever solve
that old mystery

02:21.308 --> 02:24.243

all them fish what was
in his bag?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.544
No.

If you need me to solve
your mystery,

02:34.922 --> 02:37.656
simply write down your mystery
on a small piece of paper,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.758
then attach that paper
to a pigeon,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.693
then let that pigeon fly
to my house,

02:41.695 --> 02:43.295
then I will read your paper,

02:43.297 --> 02:46.098
and then,
before you know it,
mystery solved.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.001
It's as simple as one, two,
three...

Don't delay. Offer ends soon.

It's as simple as
one, two, three, four.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.521
Lindsay, I just got
a great idea.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.425
I think we should frost
this little tip right here,

03:13.427 --> 03:18.130
because this country bumpkin
is goin' to the big city

03:18.132 --> 03:19.798
to find himself a pigeon.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.602
(BLEEP) it.

order something?
-No.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.222
Oh, shit. Pigeon is dead?

03:43.224 --> 03:44.856
Hmm. What do we do with him?

03:44.858 --> 03:47.259
-Dad...
-I don't think you're supposed
to bury them

03:47.261 --> 03:50.329
because they can get ants
or maggots or something
like that.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.730
-Dad.
-We could burn him.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.632
Or flush him down the toilet.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.200
But I don't think he'll fit.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.603
I guess we could always
cut him up into little pieces,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.938
but if you're gonna do that,
you might as well
just burn him.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.774
Jesus Christ, I'm right here.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.043
Oh! Well, then who's this?

04:09.782 --> 04:11.817
BILL: Well, Lufkin
is a small town,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.752
and we just don't
have many pigeons,

04:13.754 --> 04:16.355
so I had gone to Dallas
and I captured one.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.023
Can you believe it?

04:18.025 --> 04:20.792
Next to a dumpster
behind the 76 station
and I got him in my car.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.628
I just put him on the seat
there in the back

04:22.630 --> 04:24.162
and he was just still,
you know?

04:24.164 --> 04:26.898
And we just drove around
in silence for a while.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.734
And I had about forgot about
him when, out of nowhere,

04:28.736 --> 04:31.370
he flapped up in the
front seat and I damn near
crashed my car.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.905
And I guess I must have
just backhanded him
a little bit,

04:33.907 --> 04:36.408
but his little neck
must have just broken.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.876
I felt bad about it.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.144
But, you know, you had
stated in your commercial

04:39.146 --> 04:41.079
to send you a pigeon
with a note,

04:41.081 --> 04:44.082
and I didn't know
if you needed the pigeon
for technical reasons,

04:44.084 --> 04:45.550
or paperwork,
or what have you,

04:45.552 --> 04:46.885
because I don't know
how it works,

04:46.887 --> 04:48.987
so I went into the
box-and-ship place

04:48.989 --> 04:51.456
and they suggested that
refrigerated packaging,

04:51.458 --> 04:53.392
so that there'd
be no spoilage.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.260
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.662
Oh. Okay.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.697
Well, would you like me
to say it again?

04:58.699 --> 05:02.834
No, I was just letting
everyone know that I'm
not interested in any of this.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.938
Well, well, well.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.940

to meet you.

on the boat.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.704
I wouldn't be so cocky
if I were you, Fred.

to be on my boat?

want 'cause I'm the one
