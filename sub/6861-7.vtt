WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:05.039
Sure are taking your time
with that bandage, Doc.

00:05.039 --> 00:07.208
WADE: If there's anything
 I can do to repay the favor,

00:07.208 --> 00:08.442
you know where to find me.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.578
I guess I'm just not
that kind of girl.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.213
WADE:
 Is this why you stopped our
 little frolic the other night?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.648
You got googly eyes
for golden boy George?

00:14.648 --> 00:15.783
Hello there, Dr. Hart.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.218
Are you sure you want
to be seen talking to me?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.552
Yeah, I'll take my chances.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.522
Zoe Hart has flipped
some New York switch in you,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.691
and you are just not
the same person anymore.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.093
LEMON:
 You know how difficult
 this is for me.

00:25.093 --> 00:27.228
LAVON:
 Difficult never stopped me.

00:27.228 --> 00:36.637
I'm so sorry that
I don't know what I want.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.073
without tasting
Agnes's sweet tea.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.241
It's a Southern staple.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.110
I'm not really
into sugary things.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.577
It's not that sugary.

00:45.113 --> 00:48.249
Well, not if you compare
it to her grape lemonade

00:48.249 --> 00:51.119
or... a cup of sugar.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.254
Shep! How's it going?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.655
Well, how do you
think it's going?

00:54.655 --> 00:57.658
Ever since you started that
steak of the month club,

00:57.658 --> 01:00.794
I spend every fourth Tuesday
being chased by gators.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.497
Now, I'm pretty
attached to my legs.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.965
I'd like to stay that way.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.701
And I got a package
for you, Dr. Hart.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.869
It's from your mom.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.104
Nice note.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.340
Seems like she had
a good time down here.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.108
Glad you two made up.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.009
Shep...
Huh?

01:16.009 --> 01:18.346
We'll see you around. Okay?

01:18.346 --> 01:20.114
Yeah, whatever.
(laughs)

01:20.114 --> 01:22.950
Oh...

01:22.950 --> 01:24.285
Cashmere. That's nice.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.819
My mother doesn't do nice.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.422
She definitely doesn't send
a package without an agenda.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.623
There's obviously...

01:29.623 --> 01:31.992
Aha!

01:31.992 --> 01:33.227
An agenda.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.562
One of your friends got married?

01:34.562 --> 01:35.963
My college roommate.
There.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.631
So your mama was being nice.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.402
Lavon, you so don't understand
New York mothers.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.705
She sent this to imply that
my life is at a standstill

01:44.705 --> 01:46.674
while everyone in
New York is moving on.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.243
Look at Sophie, she's married,
in private practice,

01:49.243 --> 01:50.978
while you're doing
a whole big fat nothing.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.046
"Thought I would
enjoy this," my ass.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.682
Big Z, no offense...

01:54.682 --> 01:57.585
I mean, it's not like you, you
working on a social life here.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.888
A) It is impossible to have
a social life in BlueBell.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.290
Who am I gonna date, Crazy Earl?

02:02.290 --> 02:04.392
And B) it doesn't matter,

02:04.392 --> 02:05.893
because I'm only here for work.

02:05.893 --> 02:10.398
And it just so happens that
I find my work very rewarding.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.634
(snuffling)

02:13.634 --> 02:14.602
A pig?

02:14.602 --> 02:16.337
You want me to stitch up a pig?

02:16.337 --> 02:19.139
The vet's all the way
in Mobile.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.409
Please, ma'am,
he's our mascot.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.679
So, you single?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.881
(squeals)

02:42.230 --> 02:43.664
Miss Breeland,
I-I'm sorry, I just can't.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.766
Listen, the entire Junior
League was counting on you.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.168
I'm sure, but...
I'm afraid I'm double-booked.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.738
NASCAR and I do a lot of work
for the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

02:50.738 --> 02:52.973
and there's a lot of kids
in Birmingham that really...

02:52.973 --> 02:55.709
Okay, let me tell you something,
Mr. Brian Vickers.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.645
You may think that
you take your life

02:57.645 --> 02:59.580
in your hands every time
you take the wheel,

02:59.580 --> 03:02.516
but you have not known
true fear-- until now.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.719
Because I am siccing the
entire BlueBell chapter

03:05.719 --> 03:09.122
of the Alabama Junior League
on you, and we will be watching,

03:09.122 --> 03:11.659
and waiting until
the time is right...

03:11.659 --> 03:13.661
to strike.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.467
You take care. It was such
a pleasure to meet you.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.201
You say hello to
the children for me.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
It was nice meeting you as well.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.472
GEORGE:
Hey, Brian.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.408
Hey, dude.
You okay, man?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.877
Ah, man, I'm...
tell her I'm sorry.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.879
I'm... terribly sorry.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.118
Let me guess,
he cancelled?

03:38.118 --> 03:39.553
The day before the event.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.422
I promised that I could
deliver a major NASCAR driver.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.291
Now what am I supposed
to tell Delia Ann

03:43.291 --> 03:44.825
and the rest of
the Junior League?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.627
That he cancelled?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.963
George, the turtle race raises
money for ecological purposes.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.300
It's a, it's a very
important cause.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.434
The cause...

03:53.434 --> 03:55.168
is great, but, I mean...

03:55.168 --> 03:56.970
The race?

03:56.970 --> 04:00.308
I mean, you gotta admit, it's...
it's a... it's a little silly.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.643
Oh, honey. It's okay.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.412
No one expects you to come.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.714
Okay, what are you saying?

04:06.714 --> 04:09.317
(whispering):
Everybody knows that
you're afraid of reptiles.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.918
Okay, I am not
afraid of reptiles!

04:10.918 --> 04:12.453
Okay? I'm practically
poker buddies

04:12.453 --> 04:14.187
with Burt Reynolds
the alligator.
Mm-hmm.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.923
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.226
Just those... racing
turtles are a little...

04:19.226 --> 04:20.528
well, they're
a little unpredictable.

04:20.528 --> 04:21.995
Mm-hmm.
I mean, that Margaret Mitchell

04:21.995 --> 04:24.532
got me in the arm last year.
Dearest, it's okay.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.867
You know what? Tomorrow
night you can just go off

04:26.867 --> 04:29.503
and do whatever you want.
Have a good time.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.272
Baby, I'm serious.
She bit me.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.741
They bite!

04:35.409 --> 04:37.545
ZOE:
 Okay. And how long
 have you been

04:37.545 --> 04:38.679
experiencing the symptoms?

04:38.679 --> 04:39.947
The mild headache
and the hangnail.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.682
Couple weeks.
Few days. Don't know.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.283
Is it true you're
from New York?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.486
Yes.
How long you been in town?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.888
A couple of months.
So is the pain all over

04:47.888 --> 04:49.623
your head, or just
in the front?
You dating anyone?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.659
It just so happens that
I'm taking a year off

04:51.659 --> 04:53.561
from the dating scene.
Mm.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.229
I'm supposed to be
asking you the questions.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.231
Wow, look at that,
headache's gone.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.367
You are a great doctor.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.635
Wait, what?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.338
I'll just take my lollipop
and skedaddle.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.979
I'm sorry.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.115
I didn't see the sock on the
door of my medical practice.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.417
What's eating you?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.054
All my friends in New York

05:21.054 --> 05:24.458
are evolving: going to
openings and parties.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.726
First-run movies.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.661
Getting married
in the New York Times.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.062
When I get back to New York,

05:29.062 --> 05:30.798
I'm going to be like
one of those astronauts

05:30.798 --> 05:32.533
from Avatar, who were shoved
into sleeping pods

05:32.533 --> 05:35.068
and wake up with a year
of their life just gone,

05:35.068 --> 05:36.404
while not advancing
their surgical skills

05:36.404 --> 05:37.505
or their social life.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.806
So, start dating.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.141
I mean, you might meet
somebody wonderful here.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.410
I know I did.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.712
(chuckles)
Oh, honey.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.414
(kissing)

05:46.414 --> 05:49.216
Bill, you are absolutely right.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.118
He is?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.953
Mm-hmm.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.824
I may only be here a year,
but I need to evolve, too.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.225
I should date.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.827
Now, I don't expect to meet

05:59.827 --> 06:01.795
my perfect match in BlueBell--
I'm not banana balls--

06:01.795 --> 06:04.064
but it's time to get out
of that sleep pod thingy.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.535
Put a little life experience
under my belt.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.836
Yeah. I'm gonna date.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.705
ZOE:
 I don't understand.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.641
There must be some single guys
in BlueBell.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.842
SHELLEY:
'Course there are.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.445
Well, I do gut my own fish.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.080
And a good fish gutter
is so hard to find.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.551
Tom, I've told you before,
you're just too young for me.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.587
(snorts with laughter)

06:28.689 --> 06:30.558
GEORGE:
Well, Shelley,

06:30.558 --> 06:32.593
thank you for the grub.
Keep the change. And you...

06:32.593 --> 06:34.862
I heard that you, uh,
stitched up our Bo.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.397
Bet it's the first time you ever
had to do anything like that.

06:37.397 --> 06:42.102
What? No. I-I... I did a farm
rotation in med school. Mm-hmm.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.170
Udder bypasses.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.038
Beakectomies.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.173
Goat-o-suction.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.075
Right.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.142
(laughs)

06:49.142 --> 06:50.878
Well, you have a nice day.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.012
Thank you.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.751
Oh, no.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.620
Oh, honey, don't tell me.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.122
George Tucker is the absolute
opposite of single.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.090
Which means he's...

07:03.090 --> 07:05.225
Taken. I know.
I don't like George.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.928
There's got to be some
other guy in this town.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.697
Someone...
like George, but single.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.532
Well, there's always Wade.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.601
You did nearly hook up
with him a couple weeks ago.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.736
Yeah, and that was a
mistake, mistake, mistake!

07:15.736 --> 07:17.605
Why don't you just
give him a chance?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.508
And then tell me
all about it.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.376
(Wade chatting)

07:23.376 --> 07:25.979
Oh, hey, Doc.
Shelley.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.515
Uh, two beers.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.683
And two more for my wife.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.485
Anyway, so he's drunk...

07:34.454 --> 07:36.924
Brian Vickers bowed out?

07:36.924 --> 07:39.693
It's not a problem.
I'll just find somebody else

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
to cohost with me.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.196
I'll just...

07:43.196 --> 07:46.433
call that agent in Mobile,
and we'll just drum up

07:46.433 --> 07:47.535
some other sports celebrity.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.136
But why?

07:49.136 --> 07:52.105
We've got our own local legend
right in town-- Mayor Hayes.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.373
Oh, no.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.975
We can do much better than that.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.376
I disagree.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.978
Excuse me?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.748
Obviously, I am not
a fan of the man.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.416
But it's time for this
league to face the fact

08:03.416 --> 08:05.553
that the man is
astoundingly popular.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.654
It's settled.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.221
Ask him this afternoon.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.925
But...
I'm sure I didn't
hear a "but."

08:15.128 --> 08:16.296
Of course you didn't.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.931
(laughing)

08:17.931 --> 08:20.167
It's such a great idea!

08:22.269 --> 08:24.037
ZOE :
 Wade is married?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.439
How could I not know this?
We didn't know they
were still married.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.241
But how? Who? Huh?

08:28.241 --> 08:31.178
About four years ago, Tansy
and Wade were messing around

08:31.178 --> 08:32.546
for a few weeks.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.448
Then one night, they get
rip-roaring drunk

08:35.448 --> 08:37.150
and come back married.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.586
Just like a bad sitcom,

08:38.586 --> 08:39.986
except instead of Vegas,

08:39.986 --> 08:42.623
it was a shrimp boat
in international waters.

08:42.623 --> 08:47.060
Only lasted about four months,
'cause they fought all the time.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.462
Thought they were divorced,
but apparently...

08:49.462 --> 08:51.665
There are no single
men in BlueBell.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.701
(knock on door)
Excuse me.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.069
Hi. Uh... Dr. Hart?

08:56.069 --> 08:58.438
Dr. Judson Lyons.
I'm a vet up in Mobile.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.141
Uh, hi, Dr. Lyons.
I just wanted to

09:01.141 --> 09:03.476
thank you for that
wonderful job you did on Bo.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.313
I've never saw subcuticular
sutures on a pig before.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.582
Oh. It was nothing.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.883
May I ask you to dinner?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.252
As a thank you?
You're kidding.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.690
And by that, she
means, "Hell, yes!"

09:23.230 --> 09:25.232
* *

09:29.436 --> 09:31.171
I-It's nice.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.706
I don't want nice!

09:32.706 --> 09:33.974
I want to knock him dead.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.044
I want va-va-voom.
Is it va-va-voomy?

09:38.779 --> 09:41.381
Z, isn't there a girl
around you could ask?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.783
Come on, Lavon, I am so excited.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.052
Okay. The vet, Judson--
that's his name--

09:45.052 --> 09:46.854
Oh, we love Jud.
He treats Burt Reynolds.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.056
There's not many vets out
there who make house calls

09:49.056 --> 09:51.792
for alligators.
Yeah, he seems
kind of awesome.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.426
(chuckles)
We didn't talk for too long.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.728
But he is handsome.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.597
He loves animals,
and he's a doctor, too.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.733
And guess what?
What?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.368
We're going to
an actual restaurant!

10:01.368 --> 10:04.571
I've never been on a first date
in a restaurant before.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.239
I'm sorry, what?

10:06.239 --> 10:07.808
Oh, right. I should
probably mention

10:07.808 --> 10:10.010
that I haven't been
on a date in eight years.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.779
Eight years?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.246
How is that possible?

10:13.246 --> 10:14.982
Well, my ex-boyfriend and I
were together for six years,

10:14.982 --> 10:16.349
and that was just
a study session that

10:16.349 --> 10:18.318
turned into a hook up
that turned into six years.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.287
Oh, wow.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.755
(doorbell rings)

10:23.356 --> 10:24.357
Hello.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.893
Oh, my, what a nice dress.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.228
Oh, goodness, I am
so sorry for your loss.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.997
I presume you're
off to a funeral.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.500
Mayor Hayes,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.035
we have a favor to ask.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.503
We all know you're
incredibly busy.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.772
As are we. So why don't we
just get this over with,

10:38.772 --> 10:40.173
and you can go ahead
and say no.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.710
Usually I like to hear
a request before I refuse it.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.312
Request is, will you
do us the honor

10:45.312 --> 10:47.981
of cohosting the Junior League
Turtle Derby with Lemon?

10:47.981 --> 10:51.852
Again, we know that you have
many civic obligations

10:51.852 --> 10:53.754
and couldn't possibly, so...

10:53.754 --> 10:57.190
It's an important town
event for charity.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.927
And cohosting with
Lemon Breeland--

10:59.927 --> 11:00.928
that sounds delightful.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.129
(Annabeth laughs)

11:03.263 --> 11:05.365
My idea.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
Dr. Hart,
Dr. Hart, hi.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.270
Well, hello there.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.239
Hey, Tansy,
how's that hangnail?

11:12.239 --> 11:14.742
Oh, we both know there was
nothing wrong with me.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.276
Just came by
to check out

11:16.276 --> 11:17.778
this electricity-hogging
New York princess

11:17.778 --> 11:19.947
Wade's been
complaining about.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.648
He is my husband,
you know.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.682
Yeah, so I've heard.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.817
Mazel tov.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.118
Wade's a great guy.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.219
Well, ta-ta.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.856
My husband and I have
somewhere we need to be.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.323
WADE:
Baby.
Hi.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.125
Ba-bam.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.460
Mwah.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.594
We gonna do this
or what?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.429
TANSY:
Yep.
(both laugh)

11:37.697 --> 11:39.699
We're getting a divorce.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.301
Tucker, give us the papers.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.370
Well, hello, Wade.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.371
Hey, Tansy.
Hey.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.374
Uh, let me just
grab 'em real quick.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.278
All right, okay, I'm a-- I'm
assuming not much has changed

11:51.278 --> 11:54.047
since I drew these up
four years ago.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.983
Uh, still no children?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.717
Still no...
Money,

11:57.717 --> 11:59.219
right,
which is

11:59.219 --> 12:01.254
why we were hoping you're
working on commission today.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.291
Yeah, that's right, buddy;
we'll just add it to your tab.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.893
Can't believe we never
got around to signing it.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.128
I did try, like, four times,

12:08.128 --> 12:09.997
but you, you had
that thing with your mom

12:09.997 --> 12:12.532
and then vacation
in Branson, so...

12:12.532 --> 12:15.869
I've been real swamped,
but, come on, it hasn't been
so hard being married to me.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.538
As far as wives go, I've
been pretty undemanding.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.474
You have been pretty easy
on that whole fidelity thing.

12:21.474 --> 12:25.012
Okay, so, um, before you sign
the divorce papers,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.146
there's a question

12:26.146 --> 12:27.647
I always ask my clients,
and that is,

12:27.647 --> 12:30.818
uh, are you sure that the two
of you have done everything

12:30.818 --> 12:32.752
in your power to save
your marriage?

12:32.752 --> 12:33.921
(Wade laughing)

12:33.921 --> 12:36.356
Well, I ain't seen her
in a year,

12:36.356 --> 12:37.757
we haven't slept together
in three,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.961
so, uh, it's hard to say.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.429
What do you think, Tans,

12:42.429 --> 12:44.697
one more roll in the hay
just to make Tucker feel better?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.199
(Tansy laughs)
That's not necessary.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.568
I'm afraid my fiancé might
take issue with that.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.571
WADE:
Oh, right.
Wait a minute,
you-- she-- you're engaged?

12:51.571 --> 12:53.440
Yeah.
So Wade and I trying
to work things out now

12:53.440 --> 12:55.342
would be a
mite awkward.
All right, then,

12:55.342 --> 12:57.377
I think it's time
the two of you go ahead

12:57.377 --> 12:58.445
and sign those papers.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.080
And for that legal advice,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.648
you're gonna charge us
a hundred bucks?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.817
Come on, man.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.224
Ooh, look, there's a Woody Allen
festival in Mobile.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.093
Judson and I could go
after dinner.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.461
Hate to break
it to you, Zo,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.196
but people outside
of L.A. and New York

13:16.196 --> 13:18.265
don't really do
Woody Allen.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.399
Really?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.433
That's interesting.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.102
I think I'll add it
to my flash cards.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.105
"Why don't you like
Woody Allen?"

13:25.105 --> 13:26.539
You got to be
kidding me.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.508
What?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.543
I make a list
of potential date chitchat.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.245
You don't do that?

13:32.245 --> 13:36.149
"If you were on death row,
what would your last meal be?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.986
Also, why are you
on death row?"

13:38.986 --> 13:40.487
You can't be serious.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.123
How else am I supposed to have
an interesting conversation?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.825
If it's the right person,
conversation will just flow.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.795
I'm not really
a flow-y kind of person.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.030
Of course
you are.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.032
You know, I know you
don't like to talk

13:52.032 --> 13:54.367
about your boyfriend
in New York.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.769
The one who dumped me
in the lobby of a hospital

13:56.769 --> 13:57.938
a week before I moved here?

13:57.938 --> 13:58.939
No, I do not.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.407
And I get that,
I get that,

14:00.407 --> 14:02.242
but let's just try
and remember

14:02.242 --> 14:05.145
just for a second what it felt
like in those first days

14:05.145 --> 14:09.182
of falling in love,
so full of possibility.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.650
Yeah.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.718
I love Bill,

14:11.718 --> 14:14.087
but sometimes I'd give anything

14:14.087 --> 14:16.156
to have a magical
first date again,

14:16.156 --> 14:18.325
sharing secrets,
sharing dreams,

14:18.325 --> 14:21.594
finding someone
to share your soul.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.496
WADE:
 All right,

14:23.496 --> 14:24.697
divorced.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.366
Finally.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.202
Hey, just so you know, you're
the best wife I ever had.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.003
(laughs)

14:30.003 --> 14:31.438
We did have some good times.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.740
Remember that night that
we made our own moonshine?

14:33.740 --> 14:34.942
(sighs)

14:34.942 --> 14:36.743
I do recall we found
some pleasant ways

14:36.743 --> 14:38.745
to occupy our time.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.748
Thanks for being such a good
sport about everything, Wade.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.552
I have met a great guy, and
this time, no shrimp boat.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.288
I am going to have the
whole white veil, garter,

14:48.288 --> 14:50.290
cake in the face,
everything,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.792
and this time, I think
it might actually stick.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.961
(car horn honking)

14:53.961 --> 14:56.063
I can't wait to meet him.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.366
Um, yeah, about that,
Colt's a little jealous,

14:59.366 --> 15:02.402
so I actually think you two
should probably not interact.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.203
Seriously?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.771
Thank you. You
are the best.

15:04.771 --> 15:05.973
(honking continues)

15:05.973 --> 15:08.976
Yeah, dang,
you're a sexy creature.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.443
(laughs)

15:10.443 --> 15:11.444
(grunts)

15:11.444 --> 15:12.445
Say it again.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.347
COLT:
I said you are
a sexy creature.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.383
Hell, no.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.618
Hey.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.187
Remember when we were
playing Daphne High?

15:20.187 --> 15:21.421
I broke a rib
blocking that guy

15:21.421 --> 15:22.956
who was about to put
you in a wheelchair?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.224
I guess so.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.026
Good, 'cause you
still owe me a favor.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.494
Where's divorce papers?
Why, Wade?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.296
I mean, what,
what exactly is go...?

15:29.296 --> 15:30.463
Oh, okay.
(tears paper)

15:30.463 --> 15:32.199
I'm not getting
divorced,

15:32.199 --> 15:33.633
that's what.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.303
Thank you.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.954
Do you like your name?

15:54.954 --> 15:55.955
Judson.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.158
Can I call you Jud?

16:00.227 --> 16:02.062
Team Jacob or Team Edward?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.496
(sighs)

16:03.496 --> 16:08.601
Do you think it's okay
for doctors to wear shorts?

16:08.601 --> 16:11.304
(breathing heavily)

16:16.543 --> 16:17.544
(dials)

16:18.845 --> 16:21.048
(phone line ringing)

16:23.383 --> 16:25.185
Hello.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.721
Judson, it's Zoe.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.624
I've been thinking--
I-I don't feel well.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.792
I think I'm sick.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.163
I'm a doctor--
actually, I know I'm sick.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.532
I'm so sorry,
I can't make it tonight.

16:39.532 --> 16:43.070
Okay, well,
I, I hope you feel better.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.505
Okay, thank you.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.419
I just don't get it.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.487
I mean, I knew
you were nervous,

17:00.487 --> 17:01.488
but I thought
you were excited.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.822
You said he
seemed awesome.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.723
What part of "I don't want
to talk about it"

17:04.723 --> 17:06.059
do you not understand?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.394
I feel terrible, okay,
but there's nothing

17:07.394 --> 17:08.494
I can do
about it now.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.762
So can we please
just forget it?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.763
LAVON:
Okay, okay.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.035
Poor Judson.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.338
It's just plain mean.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.872
It's just
plain stupid.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.174
She's not getting
any younger.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.443
Her childbearing
years are dwindling.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.044
SHELLEY:
Zoe Hart, what is
wrong with you?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.346
The only good
single man

17:26.346 --> 17:28.881
in four counties,
and you stand him up?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.016
Why?

17:30.016 --> 17:31.751
Why would
you do that?

17:31.751 --> 17:35.488
You know, I probably
should be getting to work.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.694
Okay, so usually we set up
the track at the bar.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.898
Yeah, well, usually,
Lavon Hayes isn't the cohost.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.667
I say we shake
things up a bit.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.768
Okay.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.204
Okay?

17:51.204 --> 17:52.972
Wait, you-you're not
gonna argue with me?

17:52.972 --> 17:55.875
No, Lavon, I just want to
get through this meeting
as fast as possible,

17:55.875 --> 17:58.378
and I can't even believe that
you agreed to cohost with me.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.380
Lemon, come on now.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.714
Look, I knew
it was gonna bother you,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.983
but I just thought
maybe you could see

18:03.983 --> 18:06.486
that we could have
some fun together.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.622
I'm engaged.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.594
I realize that, and I also
realize that you and I

18:14.594 --> 18:16.729
are long over,

18:16.729 --> 18:18.698
but we both live
in the same small town.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.967
We...

18:20.967 --> 18:23.336
WOMAN:
Afternoon, Mayor Hayes.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.372
We got to figure out
a way to get along.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.340
You're right.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.808
So maybe we can be friends.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.110
I'd like that.
Yeah.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.812
And what better way
to start a friendship

18:32.812 --> 18:34.947
than with a turtle race?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.416
(both laugh)

18:36.416 --> 18:40.153
Oh, wait, you can be
the first to meet...

18:40.153 --> 18:42.222
(imitates drumroll)

18:42.222 --> 18:45.192
Slow Bob.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.626
You have a turtle?
Yeah.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.361
I caught him the other day
running from Burt Reynolds.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.462
He can really fly.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.763
I'm gonna put him
in the race.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.764
Oh, no, no.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.533
Delia Ann's turtle
Margaret Mitchell

18:53.533 --> 18:55.435
has won the turtle race
for the last 18 years.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.170
Because everybody throws
the race for her.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.771
Well, Delia Ann is
a powerful woman.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.640
She gets what she wants.
It's her event.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.309
Well, I am
Mayor Lavon Hayes,

19:02.309 --> 19:04.244
a-and Slow Bob here
is scrappy.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.645
You can't discount scrappy.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.446
(laughs)

19:06.446 --> 19:09.516
Tonight things change.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.352
Yeah, well, we'll see.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.823
I'm gonna call it a day.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.125
Well, you can't just
go home and wallow.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.460
And I won't.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.928
My mother had a point.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.330
I need to make
a life here,

19:23.330 --> 19:25.798
and maybe it needs to be a
life by myself right now,

19:25.798 --> 19:28.335
so I'm gonna take
myself on a date

19:28.335 --> 19:30.703
as an independent,
self-reliant woman.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.673
Well, good for you.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.076
Mm-hmm, as soon as you give
me a lift to the bus stop.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.878
* *

19:38.878 --> 19:42.148
Wade Kinsella,
have you gone certifiable?

19:42.148 --> 19:43.316
Take it you got
my message.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.017
Yeah, I got
your message.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.286
You ripped up
our divorce papers?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.420
What is wrong with you?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.655
You didn't tell me

19:48.655 --> 19:50.957
that Colt is also known
as Todd Gainey Jr.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.325
You know him?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.261
Yeah. Yeah, well, his daddy
and mine used to work

19:54.261 --> 19:55.762
on the same fishing
boat when we were kids.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.397
Now, my daddy--
he may be a drunk,

19:57.397 --> 19:59.466
but those Gainey boys never
let up, making fun of him.

19:59.466 --> 20:03.135
Todd was a bully then and
I bet you he's bully now.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.472
You can do better, Tans,
that's all I'm saying.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.174
That's why you did this--
'cause I can do better?

20:08.174 --> 20:09.576
I don't want you
to be mad, Tans;

20:09.576 --> 20:12.945
it's just, I can't
let you marry him.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.248
You're such an idiot.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.186
Hi.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.120
One ticket, please.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.922
That's right, one.

20:22.922 --> 20:23.856
I'm here by myself.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.326
Don't give me
that pitying look.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.128
Well, well, well,

20:29.128 --> 20:31.264
looks like BlueBell's
fish out of water decided

20:31.264 --> 20:33.366
to swim upstream
to Mobile.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.603
George, um, what are
you doing here?

20:36.603 --> 20:39.906
Well, looks like we are the
only two Woody Allen fans

20:39.906 --> 20:40.940
on the entire Eastern shore.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.209
One, please.
(laughs)

20:43.209 --> 20:47.079
Wow, yeah,
what a coincidence.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.481
Well, you enjoy your movie.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.482
See you in BlueBell.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.084
Oh, or... or
we could, uh,

20:52.084 --> 20:54.721
you know, we could
go in together.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.956
(chuckles)

20:56.956 --> 21:00.693
Yeah, right, right.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.562
Why not?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.363
Okay.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.664
(laughs)

21:15.842 --> 21:18.010
Well, actually,
they've been in the family

21:18.010 --> 21:19.312
for 15 years.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.313
Oh.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.981
Oh, you just go bye-bye

21:21.981 --> 21:23.316
with that stuff.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.317
Hello.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.318
LEMON:
Hello, everyone.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.653
I'm Lemon Breeland.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.488
And I'm Mayor Lavon Hayes,
and welcome

21:28.488 --> 21:32.224
to the 20th Annual Junior League
Black Tie Turtle Derby,

21:32.224 --> 21:33.460
where the going gets slow,

21:33.460 --> 21:35.462
and the slow get going.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.064
LEMON:
And I would
like to offer

21:38.064 --> 21:40.967
a special welcome to Delia
Ann Lee, who dreamed up

21:40.967 --> 21:43.736
this beautiful event over 20
years ago and, in doing so,

21:43.736 --> 21:46.973
has preserved the local
turtle population.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.541
And now our esteemed mayor
will explain the rules.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.542
We'll have four

21:49.542 --> 21:50.943
preliminary heats.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.879
The winners will move on
to race for the championship

21:52.879 --> 21:56.148
and immortality in the field
of reptile athletics.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.584
(applause)

21:59.586 --> 22:01.421
(giggling)
A general reminder.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.822
This is an honorable event.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.425
Cheating will not be tolerated
here.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.759
(laughs)

22:07.994 --> 22:09.228
May the best
turtle win!

22:09.228 --> 22:11.731
(applause and cheering)

22:13.766 --> 22:15.368
Wow.

22:15.368 --> 22:19.305
I forgot how much that movie is
such a love letter to New York.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.573
Yeah.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.409
You must miss
it a lot, huh?

22:22.409 --> 22:23.876
Oh, my God, every day.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.712
Do you?

22:25.712 --> 22:28.014
You know, I miss
it sometimes,

22:28.014 --> 22:31.618
but you don't get nights
like this in New York.

22:31.618 --> 22:35.154
You don't get
sky or stars.

22:35.154 --> 22:38.190
You definitely don't get
75-degree heat in October.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.358
(both laugh)

22:39.358 --> 22:41.193
ZOE:
 I can't believe

22:41.193 --> 22:43.129
I ran into you here... alone.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.165
Yeah, well, Lemon is not a
fan of Woody Allen. She's...

22:46.165 --> 22:47.734
Especially not Manhattan.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.403
Mainly 'cause she's not a
fan of the actual Manhattan,

22:50.403 --> 22:51.838
or Brooklyn or Queens,

22:51.838 --> 22:53.406
or anything to do
with New York, really.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.841
Hmm.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.477
She's kind of anti-Statue
of Liberty on principle.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.479
Well, she's definitely
anti-this New Yorker.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.113
(laughs)
Yeah.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.482
I wish I could disagree.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.916
Mm-hmm.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.352
Anyway, she has the
big turtle race tonight.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.020
What?
What?

23:08.020 --> 23:11.123
I'm sorry. You people say things
like that like it's normal.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.625
Right.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.927
Okay, why aren't you
at this fabulous reptile derby?

23:14.927 --> 23:17.329
Let's just say, I'm not
a big fan of turtles.

23:17.329 --> 23:20.232
Oh, so you two aren't as
perfectly matched as you seem?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.734
We have our
differences.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.935
Oh, you hardly know me.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.771
You don't have
to tell me anything.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.706
No, no, no, no. No,
that's all right.

23:26.706 --> 23:30.076
We just had a rough couple of
years when I was in New York.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.512
You know, I kept on
thinking she'd join me,

23:32.512 --> 23:34.046
and she kept thinking
I'd come back.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.849
And at the end of the
day, who was I kidding?

23:36.849 --> 23:39.586
'Cause can you imagine Lemon
Breeland in New York City?

23:39.586 --> 23:40.953
You know, a few months ago,

23:40.953 --> 23:43.289
I couldn't imagine
Zoe Hart in Alabama.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.491
(laughs)

23:44.491 --> 23:47.193
(sighs)
So...

23:47.193 --> 23:49.796
I thought I was ready to meet
someone here, you know, but...

23:49.796 --> 23:51.030
Yeah, instead, you
called to cancel

23:51.030 --> 23:52.599
while he sat
alone in Fancie's?

23:52.599 --> 23:53.933
Good grief.
What?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.267
I panicked, okay?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.904
It doesn't make me
a terrible person, does it?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.639
Huh.
Oh, man.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.541
Can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

24:01.541 --> 24:03.976
I'm sorry, did you say,
tall glass of wine?

24:03.976 --> 24:05.978
Yes, please.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.449
* *

24:10.449 --> 24:12.585
(crowd cheering)

24:17.957 --> 24:19.826
Yeah! Go,
Margaret Mitchell!

24:19.826 --> 24:21.794
LAVON:
Oh, and Number
Six, Snappy, looks

24:21.794 --> 24:24.163
to be making a dramatic move
on the outside rail.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.698
(crowd gasps)
Oh! Whoops!

24:25.698 --> 24:26.799
Snappy seems to have

24:26.799 --> 24:27.967
taken quite a tumble.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.670
Snappy's on his back,
struggling.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.704
Come on, Snappy.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.873
Snappy!
Oh, he's back up.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.475
Yeah.
Play through the pain,
little dude.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.310
Margaret Mitchell.
Go Margaret Mitchell!

24:38.310 --> 24:39.646
Oh, come on, Mitchell.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.614
Come on, baby.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.851
DELIA ANN:
M.M., don't choke. Don't choke,
baby. Remember what I told you.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.854
I'm just gonna help her
a little bit.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.956
Oh, yeah!
LEMON:
And...

24:49.956 --> 24:51.958
in her jaunty red number,
11, Delia Ann's

24:51.958 --> 24:53.693
Margaret Mitchell
looks as chic

24:53.693 --> 24:55.361
as she does speedy this evening.

24:55.361 --> 24:58.197
(applause)

24:58.197 --> 25:00.733
Go, Margaret Mitchell! Go!

25:00.733 --> 25:03.102
Oh, wait. Wait.
What do we have here?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.604
Number 17,

25:04.604 --> 25:06.205
Shelly Long, seems
to be overtaking

25:06.205 --> 25:07.540
Margaret Mitchell...

25:10.142 --> 25:12.011
Oh, now, come on now!
That's clearly...

25:12.011 --> 25:14.046
Within the rules.
A turtle-racing coach

25:14.046 --> 25:16.082
may correct their
racer's trajectory

25:16.082 --> 25:18.785
so long as they don't push
them towards the finish line.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.352
Go, Margaret!
She's gonna do it!

25:20.352 --> 25:21.554
She's gonna do it!

25:21.554 --> 25:23.890
(applause, cheering
and whooping)

25:23.890 --> 25:25.057
(shouting)

25:25.057 --> 25:26.693
(laughs)

25:26.693 --> 25:27.927
Wow. What do you know.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.696
Margaret Mitchell wins again.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.264
(quietly):
No. Just let it go, okay?

25:33.966 --> 25:36.502
All right, next up
we have, uh, Turtlelini,

25:36.502 --> 25:40.506
Prince Caspian
and my very own, Slow Bob.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.709
(applause)

25:44.677 --> 25:47.046
I was just so excited
for my date with Judson.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.915
It was only
supposed to be fun.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.549
You know, a new life experience.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.218
But then,
Addy started talking to me

25:52.218 --> 25:55.487
about what it's like to fall
in love and sharing your souls.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.957
And that's what it's supposed
to be about, right?

25:57.957 --> 26:00.993
So then I saw Judson
through the window,

26:00.993 --> 26:05.264
and he looked so nice
and so sweet,

26:05.264 --> 26:07.566
like he could be a real thing.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.970
Then I thought,
why bother?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.338
Why bother go on a first date

26:12.338 --> 26:14.540
when I don't know
how to be in a relationship.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.808
Oh, come on now.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.310
I-I hardly believe that is true.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.478
It is.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.047
When my boyfriend broke up
with me,

26:21.047 --> 26:22.414
I didn't even really cry.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.016
And we were together

26:24.016 --> 26:25.317
for six years.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.419
Six years?

26:27.419 --> 26:28.420
Mm-hmm.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.689
Wow.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.523
That's a, uh...
that's a long time.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.893
Especially because...

26:35.361 --> 26:39.598
...I'm not sure that I ever
even actually loved him.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.236
Seriously?

26:45.705 --> 26:48.307
I thought I did.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.376
But we never had one night

26:50.376 --> 26:54.180
like-like Diane Keaton
and Woody Allen in that movie.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.548
One night
when we magically connected,

26:56.548 --> 26:58.450
bared our souls.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.452
Six years,

27:00.452 --> 27:03.890
and I never really let him in.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.592
I'm nearly 30 years
old, and I have

27:06.592 --> 27:09.195
never been
in a real relationship.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.867
Something is just wrong with me.

27:14.867 --> 27:18.437
Zoe, just to let you know.

27:18.437 --> 27:21.007
Ev-Everyone is afraid

27:21.007 --> 27:23.342
to make themselves vulnerable.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.144
You know? It's...

27:25.144 --> 27:27.146
It's about baby steps, though.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.281
And, uh, I'll tell you what.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.685
You did a pretty good job
of letting me in just now.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.158
So, maybe there's hope
for you yet.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.960
(laughs)

27:48.835 --> 27:51.037
(playing pretty melody
on guitar)

27:55.141 --> 27:56.943
Hey, Tans.

27:56.943 --> 27:59.345
What are you doing here?

27:59.345 --> 28:01.080
Ah, I think I know why

28:01.080 --> 28:03.349
you really ripped up
those divorce papers.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.085
'Cause your fiancé
is a Grade-D douche?

28:06.085 --> 28:09.555
Or maybe, you are not ready
to see me with someone else.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.090
Maybe that's
why we both

28:11.090 --> 28:13.092
put off the divorce so long.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.161
Uh, I didn't put it off.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.095
You did.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.964
Wade, look inside yourself.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.598
Look at your behavior.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.467
It seems to me
you want to give us

28:21.467 --> 28:22.601
another chance.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.136
We were only together
four months.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.305
'Cause all we did was fight.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.807
You hated my guts.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.942
I loved you, you goon.

28:29.942 --> 28:33.679
I was just never sure
if you felt the same.

28:33.679 --> 28:34.981
Tans, uh...
But now

28:34.981 --> 28:36.715
that I've seen the way
you reacted

28:36.715 --> 28:38.584
to me and Colt, well...

28:38.584 --> 28:40.452
I think I know how you feel.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.121
Tansy, I...

28:42.121 --> 28:43.689
I think you misunderstood.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.157
I'm-I'm...

28:45.157 --> 28:46.225
You and me--

28:46.225 --> 28:49.195
we have always
been electric together.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.998
We just need

28:51.998 --> 28:54.333
to give in to the passion.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.804
All right.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.307
(vehicle approaching)

29:03.442 --> 29:05.778
Get your hands off my fiancée!

29:05.778 --> 29:07.013
Todd Gainey, Jr.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.447
TANSY:
Colt, honey, calm down.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.515
I strongly suggest you go back

29:09.515 --> 29:11.317
where you came from, boy.
I don't think

29:11.317 --> 29:13.152
you're in any position
to be making suggestions.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.321
What you gonna do about it?

29:18.657 --> 29:20.259
(crickets chirping)

29:20.259 --> 29:21.861
(Zoe sighs)

29:21.861 --> 29:23.796
(laughs gently)

29:23.796 --> 29:25.898
Thanks for taking me home.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.900
It was much better
than the bus.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.401
It was my pleasure.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.804
I had a really
great time tonight.
Me, too.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.039
TANSY:
No. Colt, put that down!

29:33.039 --> 29:34.706
COLT:
Bring it on,
you son of a bitch!

29:34.706 --> 29:36.375
What the hell was that?
TANSY:
Colt, put that down now!

29:36.375 --> 29:37.743
COLT: Come on!
TANSY:
Honey, no.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.811
Wade, what's going on?

29:38.811 --> 29:40.279
WADE:
Hey, guys.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.382
Uh, sorry, uh, now's not
a real good time to hang.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.184
This gentleman...

29:48.354 --> 29:51.023
...claims he's gonna
kill me now.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.926
We weren't
doing nothing!

29:53.926 --> 29:55.061
Colt? Colt, let's just
be reasonable here.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.362
What is that thing, anyway?

29:56.362 --> 29:57.964
It's a crossbow. What
planet are you from?

29:57.964 --> 30:00.799
Go ahead, Todd. Go ahead,
shoot me. I dare you!

30:00.799 --> 30:03.335
Are you insane?!
Wade, shut up. He will.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.304
Colt, I need you to think here,
'cause you're not thinking.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.339
His name ain't Colt.
It's Todd Gainey Jr., and

30:07.339 --> 30:09.208
if ever you need proof that he's
a degenerate, look at him now.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.010
Do not listen to him!
Look at me.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.846
Colt! Look at me.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.115
I'm a lawyer, and
I can tell you,

30:16.115 --> 30:20.486
now what you are about to do
is commit a serious felony.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.788
Now, I'm talking
major jail time.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.857
Now, whatever it is
that you think

30:24.857 --> 30:27.093
Wade has done,
even if he did it...

30:27.093 --> 30:28.260
Which I didn't!

30:28.260 --> 30:29.528
Shut up, Wade.
He's not worth it.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.963
All right, it's
not worth all that.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.331
So why don't you just

30:32.331 --> 30:33.933
give me that, thing?
Come on, Colt.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.268
Just hand it over.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.709
(sighs)

30:43.709 --> 30:45.377
(sighing)

30:45.377 --> 30:47.846
Hey, Tansy, don't...
don't be mad.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.848
I only did it 'cause I love you.

30:49.848 --> 30:50.950
This guy.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.118
Next time try flowers.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.186
Seriously? You're joking now?

30:55.087 --> 30:56.255
You're lucky you didn't

30:56.255 --> 30:57.823
shoot someone,
you lunatic.

30:57.823 --> 31:00.492
George,
the safety!
(yelling)

31:00.492 --> 31:03.162
WADE:
Gainey, you son
of a bitch!

31:03.162 --> 31:05.264
Put your hands
under his head.
Oh, my God.
Shot him!

31:05.264 --> 31:07.133
ZOE: Just like that.
WADE:
Oh, my God!

31:07.133 --> 31:08.300
Oh, he's driving away!

31:08.300 --> 31:09.835
There's a thing in my leg!

31:09.835 --> 31:12.104
Shh...
There's an arrow in my...

31:12.104 --> 31:13.505
Okay, so, in the final
race, it looks like

31:13.505 --> 31:15.407
Boxy the Box Turtle is
still stuck in the wall,

31:15.407 --> 31:17.276
and Tortoise D'Force
is walking backwards.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.611
So, Margaret Mitchell
and my very own Slow Bob are

31:19.611 --> 31:21.613
in a slow race
to the finish!

31:21.613 --> 31:22.881
Go, Slow!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.350
Your turtle is
moving too fast.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.018
Oh, he is scrappy,
ain't he?

31:26.018 --> 31:27.719
Do something
about it.

31:27.719 --> 31:31.757
What? Are you asking me
to throw the race for you?

31:31.757 --> 31:33.859
You know very well
this is my event.

31:33.859 --> 31:36.362
I win, and if the
people help me,

31:36.362 --> 31:38.030
so be it.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.032
(laughs)
I won't do it.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.701
(laughing):
Oh, yes, you will.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.236
You can't come in here

31:44.236 --> 31:47.606
and change the way this race
has been going on for 20 years.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.175
I should never
have let

31:49.175 --> 31:52.878
those ladies talk me into
allowing you to host!

31:52.878 --> 32:00.586
Your arrogance and sanctimonious
attitude has no place here!

32:00.586 --> 32:02.921
And if you won't go
and do anything

32:02.921 --> 32:04.923
about that turtle
of yours, I will.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.659
I am Delia Ann Lee,

32:07.659 --> 32:10.662
and I will win!

32:11.663 --> 32:13.665
(gasps)

32:13.665 --> 32:16.535
(all murmuring)

32:18.537 --> 32:20.339
Oh.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.341
Whoops.

32:28.614 --> 32:29.881
(chuckling):
Thank you.

32:29.881 --> 32:34.720
I haven't seen fire in you
like that in a long time.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.123
So, folks, it's turtle
neck to turtle neck.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.958
ALL:
Go, Slow Bob! Go, Slow Bob!

32:41.560 --> 32:42.461
No!
No!

32:42.461 --> 32:45.431
LAVON:
Come on, go,
Slow Bob!

32:45.431 --> 32:46.432
Slow Bob, go!

32:47.433 --> 32:49.068
Go! Come on!

32:49.068 --> 32:51.437
Slow Bob wins!
Slow Bob, yeah!

32:51.437 --> 32:52.871
Oh!

32:52.871 --> 32:54.806
Ah!
Yes!

32:54.806 --> 32:56.075
Yes!

32:56.075 --> 32:58.277
(laughing)

33:02.981 --> 33:04.250
Addy, thanks for meeting me.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.251
ADDY:
How is he?

33:05.251 --> 33:07.386
Here we go.
Here. Come on.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.988
Okay.
I'm just gonna...
lay down here. That's it.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.523
Okay. Hang on.
That's good.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.259
I really cannot believe
I shot myself in the leg

33:13.259 --> 33:15.027
with a crossbow.
I know how to handle

33:15.027 --> 33:16.162
a crossbow.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.429
Arrow missed his ego.
Good sign.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.964
Right. Well, just
give him the morphine.

33:18.964 --> 33:21.700
At least this time it wasn't
my fault you got injured.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.968
Yeah. Just a little warning

33:22.968 --> 33:24.503
before any indescribable pain
this time!

33:24.503 --> 33:27.439
Whoops. It's easier
when you don't know.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.674
Maybe we should call Brick.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.442
Yeah.
I can handle
this mess you made.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.144
Of course you'd be married
to a psycho

33:32.144 --> 33:34.113
with a crossbow-wielding
fiancé!

33:34.113 --> 33:35.247
Hey, it's not my
fault that she got

33:35.247 --> 33:36.748
engaged to a lunatic.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.850
He's not a lunatic.
He's just extremely jealous.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.420
No, but it is your fault
that you were canoodling
with another man's girl.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.455
You don't know what
you're talking about!

33:43.455 --> 33:45.857
Shh! I have an arrow
in my leg.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.060
All right,
you two, out.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.828
Out!

33:49.828 --> 33:53.432
As soon as I find Colt,
I'm gonna tell him about us.

33:53.432 --> 33:57.869
Whoa, uh, Tans, I think things
got a little out of control.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.938
What are you saying?

33:59.938 --> 34:01.473
Were you about
to kiss me or not?

34:01.473 --> 34:04.076
Well, I was...

34:05.744 --> 34:06.912
but I shouldn't have been.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.081
What's that supposed to mean?

34:09.081 --> 34:12.351
Well, it just, it means...

34:12.351 --> 34:13.985
Tans, I-I don't feel
the same way.

34:13.985 --> 34:17.255
But it doesn't mean
you should marry
that psychopath.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.024
I mean, he's a bully
and a drunk,

34:19.024 --> 34:20.259
and if tonight
doesn't prove that,

34:20.259 --> 34:21.993
then I don't know
what to say.

34:21.993 --> 34:25.197
You have no right to tell me
who I can and cannot marry!

34:25.197 --> 34:27.166
Sure, Colt's
not perfect,

34:27.166 --> 34:28.333
but he loves me!

34:28.333 --> 34:29.967
He loves me enough
to try and kill you.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.404
At least I know that.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.813
You know, I had fun tonight.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.317
Me, too.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.420
Guess it turns out
we can be friends.

34:50.656 --> 34:54.360
Actually, Lemon, um...

34:54.360 --> 34:56.562
I don't think we can.

34:57.963 --> 35:00.166
Why not?

35:03.034 --> 35:05.237
Because I still love you.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.313
(phone rings)

35:15.914 --> 35:17.383
Hello? Addy?

35:19.418 --> 35:20.419
What?!

35:22.120 --> 35:24.323
Okay, okay, thank you.

35:26.024 --> 35:29.027
George is hurt!

35:29.027 --> 35:32.130
I gotta go.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.271
You're all set.
That's what you get

35:39.271 --> 35:41.473
for being a knight
in shining armor all the time.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.974
(chuckles)
Oh, really?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.776
Kind of seems to me

35:44.776 --> 35:47.078
that you're the one
always coming to my rescue.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.880
(chuckles)

35:51.450 --> 35:53.452
I had a very nice time tonight.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.924
You remind me of
a lot of things.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.497
LEMON:
George!

36:05.497 --> 36:09.235
George, sweetheart,
are you okay?!

36:09.235 --> 36:12.538
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm... I'm...

36:12.538 --> 36:13.972
(chuckles)

36:13.972 --> 36:15.974
Honey, I'm, I'm fine.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.009
Oh, my God...

36:18.009 --> 36:20.312
I'm fine.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.848
I'm okay.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.450
Hey...

36:24.450 --> 36:28.554
I'm... just fine.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.892
Nice work.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.893
Thanks.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.762
You okay?

36:36.762 --> 36:40.432
Addy, you were right.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.502
With the right person,
it does just flow.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.110
I don't think
I will, Rick.

36:52.110 --> 36:54.680
Why not? After all,
I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.181
I think
I'm entitled to know.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.584
Last night I saw what
has happened to you.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.586
The rake I knew
in Paris, I could
tell him...

37:00.586 --> 37:02.220
You been here all night?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.023
The one who looked
at me with such hatred.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.893
What you watching?

37:07.893 --> 37:10.429
Casablanca.
It's so sad.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.130
We knew very little
about each other

37:12.130 --> 37:13.432
when we were in
love in Paris.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.234
Why is it that
the ones we want are always

37:16.234 --> 37:18.437
the ones we can't have?

37:21.773 --> 37:23.742
I don't know.

37:26.144 --> 37:27.178
All I know is,

37:27.178 --> 37:28.680
we can't give up.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.215
Love is worth fighting for.

37:30.215 --> 37:33.719
Well, I'm not running away
anymore. I'm settled now.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.387
Above a saloon,
it's true,

37:35.387 --> 37:39.425
but walk up a flight.
I'll be expecting you.

37:44.830 --> 37:45.997
Hey!

37:45.997 --> 37:48.099
Hi.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.668
Glad you're here.

37:49.668 --> 37:55.006
Listen, uh, I didn't
mean to lead you on.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.542
Not last night

37:56.542 --> 37:59.277
and not when we
were together.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.180
I care about you, Tans.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.550
You can do way
better than me.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.486
Certainly do way better
than Todd Gainey, Jr.

38:07.486 --> 38:10.155
Colt is kind of a douche.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.222
Yeah.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.659
I told him it's over.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.664
You're gonna find
someone amazing,
you know?

38:18.664 --> 38:23.201
And you're gonna
have the big wedding

38:23.201 --> 38:24.235
and a cake,

38:24.235 --> 38:26.572
everything.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.306
You deserve to be happy.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.777
I'll have George
redraw the papers.

38:35.347 --> 38:39.117
But, Wade, you deserve
to be happy, too.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.119
Move on from Zoe Hart.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.253
(chuckles)

38:42.253 --> 38:44.122
A girl like that
is never ever gonna

38:44.122 --> 38:45.391
end up with someone
like you.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.958
It's her loss,
but it's the truth.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.194
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.062
Zoe Hart drives me crazy.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.063
(both chuckle)

38:52.063 --> 38:53.298
Yeah.

38:53.298 --> 38:55.801
You used to drive me crazy, too.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.736
* *

39:09.347 --> 39:12.283
How you feeling,
sweetheart?

39:12.283 --> 39:14.853
(scoffs) Well, uh...

39:17.088 --> 39:18.490
kind of stupid,
actually.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.958
(both chuckle)

39:19.958 --> 39:23.194
I mean, I still can't believe
I got shot in the leg

39:23.194 --> 39:24.430
by a dropped crossbow.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.632
It's not even
a tough story.

39:26.632 --> 39:29.601
How'd you even end up
at Wade's in the first place?

39:29.601 --> 39:33.839
I... uh, I was driving home

39:33.839 --> 39:38.243
from the movies,
and I heard someone screaming.

39:38.243 --> 39:42.113
Well, they were lucky
to have you.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.850
I don't know about that.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.384
Mm.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.119
How were the turtle races?

39:48.119 --> 39:51.189
Oh. (sighs)

39:51.189 --> 39:52.858
Believe me, honey...

39:56.928 --> 39:59.397
(sighs)

40:00.566 --> 40:03.401
...you would have hated it.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.270
Hmm.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.473
* *

40:22.821 --> 40:25.924
So how's
the marriage going?

40:25.924 --> 40:30.028
Yeah, we're, uh,
we're divorced now.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.731
Gotta say, seems like
that's for the best.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.536
Ooh, you might want to,
uh, sneak out the back.

40:39.705 --> 40:40.506
No.

40:40.506 --> 40:43.274
I freaked out.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.710
I didn't give Judson a chance.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.712
But he's here, he's single,

40:46.712 --> 40:49.147
and a real possibility.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.448
He could be awesome.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.783
Baby steps.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.787
(clears throat)

40:55.787 --> 40:57.055
Hi.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.325
Hi.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.594
I wanted to apologize... again

41:02.594 --> 41:03.995
for the other night.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.931
I-I... panicked.

41:05.931 --> 41:07.733
I was nervous.

41:07.733 --> 41:09.735
I'm usually not that crazy.

41:09.735 --> 41:13.204
Can I buy you a drink
to make up for it?

41:13.204 --> 41:16.074
It's 10:00 a.m.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.476
Right! Right, right.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.645
Yeah. A cup of coffee?

41:19.645 --> 41:21.680
Oh, we could go to the bakery.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.682
Have you had Agnes's sweet tea?

41:23.682 --> 41:25.751
I hear it's a
real Southern staple.

41:25.751 --> 41:30.488
You know what? I'd love to.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.224
Really?

41:33.224 --> 41:34.225
Yeah.
Great.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.226
Let's go.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.161
Okay.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497
Oh. After you.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.232
Oh, thank you.
