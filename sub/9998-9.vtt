00:16.065 --> 00:18.201
Grabbed your paper.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.803
You ready to get started
with this?

00:21.839 --> 00:23.673
Do I have a choice?

00:23.741 --> 00:26.342
Your ten day window
is up, Clark.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.977
You know how it is.

00:28.045 --> 00:30.780
You don't comply with the law,
I got to tell the judge.

00:30.848 --> 00:32.815
Now come on.

00:32.883 --> 00:34.901
Let's go introduce you
to the neighbors.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.924
I just don't see how
this does anyone any good.

00:40.991 --> 00:42.575
The law's the law, Clark.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.393
You got to do this.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.746
And as your parole officer,
I got to watch you.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.264
I served my time, John.

00:48.332 --> 00:49.899
I just want to
live in peace.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.334
Your new neighbors
have every right

00:51.402 --> 00:53.236
to know who's
moving in next door.

00:53.304 --> 00:56.339
And hey, you ask me,
a little embarrassment's

00:56.406 --> 00:59.175
not a bad price to pay
for getting out of jail.

01:07.417 --> 01:09.585
And you still think
this is a good thing?

01:09.637 --> 01:11.955
I think you got to do
what you got to do.

01:12.022 --> 01:16.025
And right now, you got to
finish putting up these flyers.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.064
Hi, sweetheart.

01:21.131 --> 01:23.533
Morning.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.448
Did you just bring
that paper in?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.150
Yeah, a minute ago. Why?

01:41.218 --> 01:42.285
You want it?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.621
No. Did you talk
to anybody out there?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.522
A man with a tie maybe?

01:46.590 --> 01:49.759
Yeah. He and his friend
were putting up flyers.

01:49.827 --> 01:52.595
I think they're having
a garage sale or something.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.910
Good morning.

â™ª â™ª

02:53.752 --> 02:55.253
Did you find anything?

02:56.423 --> 02:58.361
More than you want to know.

02:58.461 --> 03:00.129
So according to this,

03:00.196 --> 03:02.631
our new neighbor used to be
an English teacher in Tucson.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.933
And ten years ago,
he raped one of his students.

03:05.001 --> 03:06.902
It gets worse.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.587
The girl was too ashamed
to tell anyone,

03:08.672 --> 03:10.472
so a few weeks later,
he tried it again.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.591
That time she pepper-sprayed him
and told her parents.

03:12.676 --> 03:16.712
My God, this girl is only a few
years older than Bridgette.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.614
You're the one
looking to go back

03:18.682 --> 03:20.182
to law school,
so you tell me--

03:20.216 --> 03:22.518
how does a guy
who rapes a teenage girl

03:22.585 --> 03:24.453
get only ten years
in prison?

03:24.521 --> 03:26.321
You know what, we're going
to have to talk to them

03:26.389 --> 03:28.557
before they go to school,
so they know what to do

03:28.608 --> 03:30.192
if they see this guy
around the neighborhood.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.494
I mean, not that we're ever
going to leave them alone again.

03:32.562 --> 03:34.896
Oh, I called Lee.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.199
He thinks he knows
this guy's parole officer.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.435
He's going to ask him
if he can drop by

03:39.502 --> 03:41.036
the police headquarters

03:41.104 --> 03:43.372
so I can ask him how worried
we should be.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.740
I just don't understand.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.242
I mean, how do you let a guy
with that kind of a history

03:47.293 --> 03:51.263
move into a neighborhood where
there are families and children?

03:51.347 --> 03:53.582
I mean, great, they've informed
us that he's living here.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.851
Frankly, all that does
is make me more anxious.

03:55.918 --> 03:59.605
Is the simple solution just to
keep these people locked away?

03:59.689 --> 04:01.156
You know what, honey?

04:01.224 --> 04:02.424
Let's forget about all this.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.693
You have a presentation.
You need to be focused.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.261
Focused-- yes.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.448
You expecting anyone?

04:09.532 --> 04:10.766
Maybe that's our new neighbor.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.468
Maybe he needs
a cup of sugar.

04:13.603 --> 04:14.703
Hi. Good morning.

04:14.771 --> 04:16.488
I'm sorry to
come by so early.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.507
Joe and Allison, right?
Yeah. Hi.

04:18.575 --> 04:20.291
Hi. Susannah Collings.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.078
I met you last year at
the Fourth of July block party.

04:23.146 --> 04:25.848
My daughter and I live around
the corner, two blocks down.

04:25.915 --> 04:27.449
Big house
with the wrap-around porch.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.952
Right. Hi. Susannah,
nice to see you again.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.087
Um, have you see these?

04:32.155 --> 04:33.589
We were just
talking about that.

04:33.656 --> 04:34.690
Yeah, well,
join the club.

04:34.758 --> 04:36.225
Everyone on the block's
in a tizzy.

04:36.292 --> 04:38.427
Anyway, I've decided to have
a meeting at my house tonight,

04:38.495 --> 04:40.462
and I would love it
if you both could come.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.631
Sure.
Great.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.434
In the meantime,
I'm going to call City Hall

04:45.502 --> 04:46.852
and see what our options are.

04:46.936 --> 04:49.071
You know what, I work for
the District Attorney's office.

04:49.139 --> 04:50.739
I'm hoping to meet with
this man's parole officer

04:50.807 --> 04:52.608
and find out what I can.

04:52.675 --> 04:55.944
Oh, wow.
That would be amazing.

04:56.012 --> 04:59.548
So I can count on both of you
for tonight? 7:30?

04:59.616 --> 05:00.749
Yeah, of course.

05:00.817 --> 05:02.918
Oh, and by the way,
thanks for doing this.

05:02.986 --> 05:06.255
Yeah, well, you guys live
three blocks away from him.

05:06.322 --> 05:07.556
I live five doors down.

05:07.624 --> 05:10.159
I really don't feel like
I have much choice.

05:15.965 --> 05:19.334
I'd like to tell you that
Clark Kerwin is a changed man,

05:19.385 --> 05:21.003
Mrs. Dubois, I really would.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.105
But the truth is,
I just don't know

05:23.172 --> 05:24.640
that to be true.

05:26.810 --> 05:29.478
Look, I still have two
little girls living at home.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.396
You have to give me
some kind of encouragement.

05:31.481 --> 05:32.848
Give me some kind of hope.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.717
Mrs. Dubois, I've been
a parole officer for ten years

05:35.785 --> 05:38.153
and a father for 15.

05:38.221 --> 05:40.155
Speaking as a professional,

05:40.223 --> 05:43.625
I'd say Clark's been
a model parolee.

05:43.693 --> 05:47.996
Speaking as a father, not a guy
I'd want hanging around my kids.

05:48.064 --> 05:50.365
Excuse me a second.

05:55.805 --> 05:58.006
Any good news?

05:58.074 --> 06:00.759
He likes the coffee.

06:00.844 --> 06:03.312
Yeah, on
my way.

06:05.515 --> 06:07.749
That was your new neighbor.

06:07.817 --> 06:10.552
Sounds like the welcome wagon's
already paid him a visit.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.122
Someone threw a rock
through his living room window.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.458
I was in the bedroom
when I heard the glass break.

06:16.526 --> 06:18.894
By the time I got
to the front of the house,

06:18.945 --> 06:22.130
whoever did it was long gone.

06:22.198 --> 06:24.399
I guess I should
just be grateful

06:24.467 --> 06:26.401
the rock didn't hit me.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.538
Mrs. Dubois,
Detective Scanlon,

06:29.606 --> 06:31.573
I'd like you to meet
Clark Kerwin.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.675
Clark, Detective Scanlon's
here with the local police.

06:33.743 --> 06:35.410
He's here
to take you report.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.779
Mrs. Dubois, in addition to working
with the District Attorney's office

06:37.847 --> 06:40.299
is one of your new neighbors.

06:40.383 --> 06:42.951
Oh, I'll bet this is almost
as exciting for you

06:43.019 --> 06:44.253
as it is for me.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.022
This is not right.
This is not us.

06:47.090 --> 06:48.891
Whatever.

06:48.958 --> 06:50.359
Mind taking me
in the house?

06:50.426 --> 06:52.294
I'd like to try
to recover the rock

06:52.362 --> 06:53.562
or whatever it is
they used.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.597
Dust it, see if
I can get a print.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.932
Sure.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.701
So what happens now?

06:59.769 --> 07:02.004
You and I going to go
around the neighborhood,

07:02.071 --> 07:03.939
put up a new set of flyers
warning people

07:04.007 --> 07:05.641
there's a rock thrower
in town?

07:08.711 --> 07:10.412
I didn't think so.

07:14.284 --> 07:15.717
Algae biofuel is our future.

07:15.785 --> 07:17.386
We've been hearing it
for years now.

07:17.453 --> 07:19.955
And yet high capitalization
and production costs

07:20.023 --> 07:22.758
have made it
virtually impossible

07:22.809 --> 07:24.993
to make tomorrow's
biofuel profitable today--

07:25.061 --> 07:26.495
until now.

07:26.562 --> 07:28.764
So what you're looking at,
ladies and gentlemen,

07:28.815 --> 07:31.099
is the next generation
of photo bio reactors.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.368
And here's the good news--

07:33.436 --> 07:35.604
we believe that
our unique design

07:35.672 --> 07:38.240
will allow you to generate
algae biodiesel

07:38.308 --> 07:41.376
at approximately
one half your current costs.

07:41.444 --> 07:42.744
Half, huh?

07:42.812 --> 07:45.047
Did you know the boys
at BioFraction say

07:45.114 --> 07:49.484
they'll have a reactor ready in 18
months that would cut costs almost 60%?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.453
Is that what they say?

07:51.521 --> 07:52.754
Well, talk is cheap.

07:52.822 --> 07:54.756
Unfortunately, biofuel
generation isn't.

07:54.824 --> 07:56.892
Go back and ask them
what they plan to do

07:56.960 --> 07:58.260
about light diffusion

07:58.328 --> 07:59.328
in their PBRs.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.696
They don't have
an answer yet,

08:00.763 --> 08:03.265
which is why
they need another 18 months.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.666
My colleague
Todd Gillis and I?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.201
We cracked that nut
last March.

08:06.269 --> 08:07.703
So it's up to you.

08:07.770 --> 08:10.672
You can wait 18 months and see
if the folks at BioFraction

08:10.740 --> 08:13.141
can actually cash the check
they're trying to write you...

08:13.209 --> 08:14.910
or you can go with us today.

08:14.978 --> 08:17.479
if you're wrong about them,
you only miss out on, what,

08:17.530 --> 08:19.481
A few hundred million
in savings?

08:21.384 --> 08:24.286
<i>That was very impressive.</i>

08:24.354 --> 08:25.787
They teach you that
in engineering school?

08:25.855 --> 08:27.155
Hmm, you liked that, huh?

08:27.206 --> 08:29.157
Not too bad.

08:29.225 --> 08:32.027
It doesn't go any better than that.
That's great.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.462
Okay, I'll let everyone on the team
know before we go home tonight.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.631
Listen, before you do, I was hoping you'd
come up to my office for a few minutes.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.168
I've still got a little business
I'd like to talk to you about.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.004
Dan, I've got to meet
my wife like at this...

08:42.071 --> 08:43.422
at this neighbor thing
in like 20 minutes.

08:43.506 --> 08:45.607
Take it from a man who spent
more than a few nights

08:45.675 --> 08:47.976
in the doghouse-- there are
moments that are worth it.

08:48.044 --> 08:49.845
This is one
of those moments.

08:51.147 --> 08:53.265
When you've been doing this
as long as I have,

08:53.349 --> 08:55.984
you start to believe that the
world is basically made up

08:56.052 --> 08:57.986
of two types of people--

08:58.054 --> 09:01.656
engineers who do their best work
with computers or drafting boards,

09:01.724 --> 09:05.160
and business people that don't
really understand the science,

09:05.228 --> 09:09.931
but know how to read buyers and
markets and can close a deal.

09:09.999 --> 09:13.535
It's very rare that you find someone
that can do both those things.

09:13.603 --> 09:15.904
Really nice job today, Joe.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.406
Thank you, Dan.
I appreciate that.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.257
Have a seat.

09:19.342 --> 09:23.411
I would like to bring you
up in the company, Joe.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.547
Senior management position.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.250
The type of job that comes
with an ownership stake.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.052
I-I... Dan, I don't know
what to say.

09:30.119 --> 09:31.386
Don't say
anything yet.

09:31.454 --> 09:33.188
Not till you've read the catch.

09:33.256 --> 09:34.890
Just because I see you
as upper management,

09:34.957 --> 09:36.625
doesn't mean
that anyone else does.

09:36.692 --> 09:39.094
The board sees you
as an engineer.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.196
A science guy.

09:41.264 --> 09:43.832
That's why I'd like you to get
yourself an executive MBA.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.534
Excuse me?

09:45.601 --> 09:48.236
I want you to go back to school.

09:48.304 --> 09:50.072
Now I know
it's an enormous commitment,

09:50.139 --> 09:52.674
but it's the only way
that I can make this happen.

09:52.742 --> 09:54.309
You do it at night,

09:54.377 --> 09:58.213
and after two years, you'll be
helping me run this company.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.085
Uh, I was on the
phone all day today

10:03.152 --> 10:06.388
talking to
various members

10:06.455 --> 10:10.025
of law enforcement, as well as
to our city councilmen.

10:10.093 --> 10:12.594
And the unfortunate
truth is,

10:12.662 --> 10:15.864
none of them particularly care
that my 16-year-old daughter

10:15.932 --> 10:18.800
is living just 300 feet
from a man

10:18.868 --> 10:21.870
who raped a 16-year-old girl
ten years ago.

10:21.938 --> 10:23.805
None of them care

10:23.873 --> 10:26.875
that he lives 500 feet
from you, Nancy,

10:26.943 --> 10:29.144
and you're beautiful twins,
or directly across the street

10:29.212 --> 10:31.446
from you, Bob and Kelly,
and your nine-year-old son.

10:31.514 --> 10:32.881
So what can
we do about it?

10:32.949 --> 10:34.216
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:34.283 --> 10:36.034
Okay, I'm just going
to throw this out there,

10:36.119 --> 10:39.254
but Councilman Dinardi told me
that he heard of some cases

10:39.322 --> 10:42.224
where neighborhoods actually
pooled their resources

10:42.291 --> 10:45.260
to buy the sex offender's house
from him.

10:45.328 --> 10:47.596
Okay.

10:47.663 --> 10:50.048
Didn't think that was going
to go over terribly well.

10:50.133 --> 10:53.235
That leaves one
option, really.

10:53.302 --> 10:56.037
We need to make it as
uncomfortable as possible

10:56.105 --> 10:58.340
for this gentleman to stay.

10:59.442 --> 11:00.809
Oh, I-I heard that someone

11:00.877 --> 11:02.911
threw a rock
through his window today,

11:02.979 --> 11:04.779
so, I mean, who knows?

11:04.847 --> 11:07.182
Maybe... maybe he's
already planning on moving.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.416
Yeah.
Good.

11:08.484 --> 11:09.985
Let's assume
he isn't.

11:10.052 --> 11:13.622
The sidewalk in
front of his house

11:13.689 --> 11:15.707
is public property.

11:15.791 --> 11:20.028
That means that we are entirely
within our legal rights

11:20.096 --> 11:23.398
to gather there and
express our opinion of him

11:23.466 --> 11:25.867
as loudly and as
often as we want.

11:42.685 --> 11:44.252
Hey. I know you.

11:44.353 --> 11:46.354
Didn't you
used to be my husband?

11:46.422 --> 11:48.490
We used to do
things together,

11:48.558 --> 11:49.791
like-- I don't know--

11:49.859 --> 11:51.126
go to community meetings

11:51.194 --> 11:53.528
about sex offenders
who lived on our block.

11:53.596 --> 11:56.748
You know, you've been to
one sex offender meeting,

11:56.832 --> 11:58.833
you've been to them all.

12:00.870 --> 12:02.804
Ooh. You smell like alcohol.

12:02.872 --> 12:04.339
You smell like Allison.

12:06.275 --> 12:08.743
Have you been drinking?

12:08.811 --> 12:10.979
With my boss.

12:11.047 --> 12:14.182
We did some eating, too,
and a lot of talking.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.017
I think I'm his new crush.

12:16.085 --> 12:17.586
<i>He wants you to get</i>

12:17.653 --> 12:19.921
an MBA?
Yeah.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.057
Turns out all the
cool kids have them,

12:22.124 --> 12:24.259
so I guess I
got to get one.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.329
Okay. Do you
even want an MBA?

12:27.396 --> 12:30.999
Honestly, before today, I never
even gave it any thought.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.468
But now I know the kind
of doors that it can open

12:33.536 --> 12:35.603
and the kind of money
that I could be making...

12:35.655 --> 12:37.605
But it seems
pretty ambitious.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.507
I mean, you being
in business school

12:39.575 --> 12:40.775
and me studying law.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.110
Yeah, well...

12:42.178 --> 12:43.645
it's going to be a
logistical nightmare,

12:43.713 --> 12:45.213
but we're going
to figure it out

12:45.281 --> 12:48.416
'cause that's what powerful
couples like us do, right?

12:49.819 --> 12:50.952
Whiskey?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.470
Mouthwash.

12:52.555 --> 12:53.888
Excellent.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.840
Now, come on, tell me
about this meeting.

12:55.925 --> 12:57.959
Well, there's really
not a lot to tell.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.629
I mean, it's pretty much
what you would expect, you know.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.197
People were upset.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.266
And that Susannah woman
was trying to organize

13:04.333 --> 13:05.900
a legal demonstration
outside the guy's house,

13:05.968 --> 13:07.235
and there was
a sign-up sheet.

13:07.303 --> 13:09.904
Mmm. Okay. What did
you sign us up for?

13:09.972 --> 13:11.906
Nothing.

13:11.974 --> 13:13.908
I don't know.

13:13.976 --> 13:17.512
I met the guy today--
the actual guy.

13:19.181 --> 13:20.715
Somebody threw a rock
through his window,

13:20.783 --> 13:22.817
so Scanlon and I went over.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.586
And...?

13:24.654 --> 13:26.154
And...

13:26.222 --> 13:29.557
I've met a lot of scary people.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.827
Murderers, child molesters.

13:32.895 --> 13:37.465
People who have a lot of all
kinds of darkness around them.

13:39.201 --> 13:40.835
And...?

13:40.903 --> 13:44.239
And I don't know--
I just... I didn't see that.

13:44.307 --> 13:45.874
I-I didn't feel that.

13:45.941 --> 13:47.676
Not that. Not in him.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.011
That need to hurt somebody else.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.281
The sadness, the frustration,
the anger--

13:53.349 --> 13:56.151
that I got, but the other?

13:58.187 --> 13:59.587
It's stupid, right?

13:59.655 --> 14:01.489
Come on. The guy was convicted.

14:01.557 --> 14:03.692
He did hard time.

14:03.759 --> 14:08.029
But I... I don't know...
I don't know what my problem is.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.332
I stood in the middle
of that meeting,

14:10.399 --> 14:12.567
and the madder and the madder
people got,

14:12.635 --> 14:16.671
the worse and worse I just
started to feel for this guy.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.276
Say something.

14:21.344 --> 14:23.044
None of it matters.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.013
We're going to be rich.
We're going to move.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.614
That's not funny, all right?

14:26.682 --> 14:29.684
I'm going to go to Susannah's
house tomorrow and sign us up.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.486
Of course, you are.

14:31.554 --> 14:33.521
Pick an easy shift, okay?

14:33.589 --> 14:36.091
Like early Sunday morning
when no one's really looking.

14:37.526 --> 14:40.161
Have I told you lately what
an inspiration you are to me?

14:40.229 --> 14:41.162
No.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.732
There's a reason for that.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.167
This is unacceptable.

14:46.235 --> 14:48.903
You can't give me a B.
I don't get B's.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.271
As a concept?

14:50.339 --> 14:52.340
'Cause I'd be happy
to break it down for you.

14:52.408 --> 14:54.575
Mr. Kerwin, I worked my
butt off on this paper.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.910
I know you did, Stacy.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.580
You told me so when I gave it
back to you on Monday.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.515
And then you told me again
on Tuesday

15:00.583 --> 15:02.817
and Wednesday and Thursday,
and still,

15:02.885 --> 15:06.587
you never really proved the
central thesis of your paper.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.790
Hence the "B."

15:10.126 --> 15:11.459
For the last time,
Mr. Kerwin,

15:11.527 --> 15:13.228
I have to get
an "A" on this,

15:13.295 --> 15:15.663
because without it, I drop
to number two in my class,

15:15.731 --> 15:17.098
and if I'm not
valedictorian...

15:17.166 --> 15:20.034
Stanford will never
take you, right?

15:22.204 --> 15:25.173
This is your last chance,
Mr. Kerwin.

15:25.241 --> 15:29.244
Give me the grade
that I deserve, or else.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.816
Stacy...

15:34.884 --> 15:36.985
are you threatening me?

15:39.155 --> 15:42.257
It's funny you should mention
threats, Mr. Kerwin,

15:42.324 --> 15:45.660
because you've been
threatening me all week.

15:45.728 --> 15:48.296
Check your sent mail folder.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.565
What?
Just do it.

15:58.574 --> 16:00.341
What the hell are these?

16:00.409 --> 16:01.709
Oh, those?

16:01.777 --> 16:04.078
Those are the e-mails
that you sent to me

16:04.146 --> 16:06.147
after you raped me.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.951
Oh, you don't remember?

16:10.019 --> 16:12.053
That's funny, because you get

16:12.121 --> 16:15.290
very specific about
it in your e-mails.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.061
Stacy, how did you...

16:20.129 --> 16:22.997
I'm very good with computers.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.469
What are you doing?
I'm doing what I didn't do

16:27.536 --> 16:28.887
the last time you attacked me.

16:28.971 --> 16:31.389
I am fighting back.

16:32.674 --> 16:33.975
No! Somebody help me!

16:34.043 --> 16:35.727
Stay away from me!
Oh, my God!

16:35.811 --> 16:38.146
Stay away!

16:45.468 --> 16:46.588
Okay. So if this
Kerwin guy really is innocent,

16:49.592 --> 16:51.693
I feel terrible,

16:51.745 --> 16:54.121
but speaking
strictly as a parent,

16:54.214 --> 16:55.741
if he didn't rape
that girl,

16:56.058 --> 16:57.425
then we don't have
a sex offender

16:57.492 --> 16:58.759
living in our neighborhood.

16:58.810 --> 16:59.977
Isn't that good news?

17:00.062 --> 17:02.763
Yeah, for us, but think
about that poor man.

17:02.831 --> 17:06.099
How is he supposed to get a job,
live his life?

17:06.167 --> 17:07.734
Yeah, I don't have an answer
for that, Allison.

17:07.803 --> 17:09.502
Girls are going to be up
in a few minutes.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.877
Hello.

17:16.944 --> 17:18.145
Hey, Lee.

17:18.213 --> 17:19.547
No, no, we're up.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.166
I'm going to go jump
in the shower.

17:23.234 --> 17:24.785
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

17:26.788 --> 17:29.290
Yeah, I can meet you there
in 20 minutes.

17:29.357 --> 17:31.058
I'll see you there.

17:31.126 --> 17:33.194
What? What's so terrible?

17:33.261 --> 17:35.796
That-that-that woman whose house
I was at last night--

17:35.864 --> 17:39.016
Susannah Collings--
her... her daughter is missing.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.135
She told me she was studying

17:41.186 --> 17:42.770
for the SATs
at a friend's house.

17:42.821 --> 17:45.473
I told her to wake me
when she got in.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.809
Suddenly, 4:30, I woke up,
realized she never woke me.

17:48.877 --> 17:50.611
I went to her room--
she wasn't there.

17:50.662 --> 17:53.114
And then I called her friends,
woke them all up.

17:53.165 --> 17:54.748
She wasn't there.

17:54.816 --> 17:57.618
She hadn't been there for hours,
and then, suddenly,

17:57.669 --> 18:02.423
I realized her car
was right out front.

18:02.491 --> 18:06.460
Her car is right
there, but no Hayden.

18:06.528 --> 18:08.562
Have you checked
your cell phone lately?

18:08.630 --> 18:09.880
Maybe she left you
a message,

18:09.965 --> 18:11.382
went out for breakfast
with a friend.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.851
This thing has not left
my hand since I woke up.

18:13.935 --> 18:15.402
I call her every
three minutes,

18:15.470 --> 18:17.505
and then I check to
see if she called me,

18:17.572 --> 18:19.807
and then I check my e-mails
and I double-check my texts.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.609
It's just a question
we have to ask.

18:21.676 --> 18:22.893
Why are we standing here?

18:22.978 --> 18:24.344
Shouldn't we be
looking for her?

18:24.396 --> 18:27.414
Shouldn't we be knocking
at that animal's door?

18:27.482 --> 18:28.516
Pardon me?

18:28.583 --> 18:30.951
No. I won't pardon you.

18:31.019 --> 18:33.621
I won't pardon anyone who
said it was all right

18:33.688 --> 18:36.824
for that... monster to
move onto my block.

18:36.892 --> 18:38.526
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mrs. Collings,

18:38.593 --> 18:40.161
I'd be happy to walk
down the street

18:40.212 --> 18:41.595
and have a chat
with Mr. Kerwin,

18:41.663 --> 18:43.864
but we have no reason
at this point to believe...

18:43.915 --> 18:45.766
Detective,
he raped a teenage girl!

18:45.834 --> 18:47.301
He threatened to kill her.

18:47.369 --> 18:50.905
I have a teenage girl, and
no one can tell me where she is.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.887
Hey, it's Lee.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.606
Listen, uh, put
a little detail together.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.357
Go up the block to 177.

19:10.425 --> 19:12.126
Knock on the door.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.995
Ask if we could please
take a look around the house.

19:15.063 --> 19:18.165
Let me call forensics,
take a look at the car as well.

19:18.233 --> 19:19.900
Yeah.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.870
Susannah, have you
actually met Mr. Kerwin?

19:25.674 --> 19:29.376
Allison, I think you know
the answer to that question.

19:29.444 --> 19:30.644
Look, I'm sorry.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.246
I... I just have
a strong feeling

19:32.297 --> 19:34.114
that he's got nothing
to do with this.

19:35.517 --> 19:36.917
I don't know.
I'm just hoping

19:36.985 --> 19:38.152
that any second,
your little girl

19:38.220 --> 19:39.720
is going to come
through that door

19:39.788 --> 19:42.256
and tell you about her...
her crazy night

19:42.324 --> 19:44.558
and how she lost her cell phone.

19:46.995 --> 19:49.196
I keep hoping.

19:55.303 --> 19:57.004
I swear to you,

19:57.072 --> 19:59.273
I've never seen
that girl before in my life.

20:03.945 --> 20:05.279
You know, I'm not an idiot.

20:05.347 --> 20:08.249
I mean, I see a girl like this,
I cross the street.

20:08.316 --> 20:10.451
I change seats on the bus.

20:10.518 --> 20:11.986
I don't want any trouble.

20:12.053 --> 20:13.587
I just want to live my life.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.289
We understand that,
Mr. Kerwin,

20:15.357 --> 20:17.491
and we appreciate you
coming down here.

20:17.559 --> 20:19.693
To be perfectly honest,
we're not entirely sure

20:19.761 --> 20:21.428
that this girl
was even abducted.

20:21.496 --> 20:23.530
But, uh...
if you could account

20:23.598 --> 20:24.698
for your whereabouts
last night,

20:24.766 --> 20:26.767
this would be
a very short conversation.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.174
I was at home.

20:34.242 --> 20:35.476
I watched TV.

20:35.543 --> 20:36.944
I went to bed.

20:37.012 --> 20:39.113
Can anyone confirm that?

20:39.180 --> 20:42.483
I'm on a list of registered
sex offenders, Detective.

20:42.550 --> 20:45.386
It probably won't surprise you
to hear that I live alone,

20:45.453 --> 20:47.755
so no, of course not.

20:47.822 --> 20:50.257
It wouldn't necessarily have
to be somebody you live with.

20:50.325 --> 20:52.159
Did you call out for a pizza?

20:52.227 --> 20:55.496
Or maybe a neighbor saw you
taking out your garbage?

20:55.563 --> 20:58.065
No, I didn't see anyone,

20:58.133 --> 21:00.334
and no one saw me.

21:01.836 --> 21:04.438
You know, I'm a
college-educated guy.

21:04.506 --> 21:06.407
Don't you think,
if I wanted

21:06.474 --> 21:08.776
to do this terrible
thing-- which I don't--

21:08.843 --> 21:12.012
don't you honestly think
I'd be smart enough

21:12.080 --> 21:14.882
to find someone who didn't
live in my neighborhood?

21:14.949 --> 21:19.320
On my block, where my face
is posted on every tree?

21:19.387 --> 21:21.021
With all due respect,
Mr. Kerwin,

21:21.089 --> 21:25.259
sex offenders aren't known for
their rational decision making.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.895
Even the smart ones.

21:27.962 --> 21:32.633
Okay. You're already searching
my house and my car.

21:32.701 --> 21:34.635
Not that I have a choice.

21:34.703 --> 21:36.970
We all know my Fourth Amendment
rights went away

21:37.038 --> 21:38.706
when I was convicted of rape.

21:38.773 --> 21:42.142
And I want to tell you right now
you're not gonna find anything.

21:42.210 --> 21:46.080
What I want to say,

21:46.147 --> 21:48.282
whatever else
you need me to help with,...

21:48.350 --> 21:51.185
I'll do it. I'm happy to help.

21:51.252 --> 21:54.088
I-I just want
to be clear about that.

21:56.124 --> 22:07.968
Would you be willing
to take a polygraph test?

22:20.949 --> 22:22.750
It's gonna be okay.

22:28.089 --> 22:31.191
Why would you say that to me?

22:33.027 --> 22:36.397
Every police officer,
every lawyer I've met

22:36.464 --> 22:40.067
since that girl
said I raped her...

22:40.135 --> 22:42.669
they look at me
like I'm the devil.

22:42.737 --> 22:48.342
Like... they wish
I would simply die

22:48.410 --> 22:52.179
so they.... they could
be done with me.

22:53.515 --> 22:55.482
I don't know.

22:58.119 --> 23:00.154
I guess
I just don't see the devil.

23:02.390 --> 23:04.792
I don't know why...

23:04.859 --> 23:07.761
but I think it's gonna be okay.

23:09.898 --> 23:13.500
Ah! Ooh!

23:13.568 --> 23:16.353
Well, that's a good-looking casserole
and everything.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.539
But we just ate
a couple hours ago.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.207
I'm not sure I'm up
for another meal.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.309
It's not for you.
It's for our new neighbor.

23:22.377 --> 23:24.478
Are you serious?

23:24.546 --> 23:26.146
You think that's smart?

23:28.199 --> 23:30.367
The guy's still a person
of interest

23:30.452 --> 23:32.519
in a potential kidnapping,
right?

23:32.587 --> 23:35.155
And you still work for the
District Attorney, don't you?

23:35.223 --> 23:37.291
Where are you going with this?

23:37.358 --> 23:39.526
Don't you think that some people
might see that as

23:39.594 --> 23:41.028
a conflict of interest?

23:41.129 --> 23:43.997
Come on. I'm giving the guy
a tuna casserole, not a Lexus.

23:44.065 --> 23:45.999
Fine.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.435
Just do me a favor.

23:48.503 --> 23:50.637
I know you think the guy's
innocent and everything,

23:50.688 --> 23:52.172
but if he invites you inside...

23:52.240 --> 23:54.007
Look, don't worry.
I'm just gonna stand on

23:54.075 --> 23:55.509
the porch and pass it to him.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.512
Okay. If you're not back
in ten minutes,

23:58.580 --> 24:00.280
I'm calling Jodie Foster.

24:20.969 --> 24:22.803
Hey, it's the middle
of the night.

24:22.871 --> 24:24.204
What are you doing up?

24:24.272 --> 24:27.407
Bad dream.

24:27.475 --> 24:28.742
Yeah, I had one, too.

24:28.810 --> 24:30.344
Must be going around.

24:30.411 --> 24:32.746
Tell me yours first.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.884
Well, two well-meaning people
decided to go back to school

24:37.936 --> 24:39.786
at the same time
they were trying

24:39.854 --> 24:42.089
to pay for their
oldest child's education.

24:42.156 --> 24:44.758
And?

24:44.826 --> 24:47.794
And no matter how many ways
the husband tried

24:47.862 --> 24:49.930
to make the figures work,
he just couldn't do it.

24:49.998 --> 24:54.268
Not without robbing a bank
or winning the lotto.

24:54.335 --> 24:57.404
Not for all three people.

25:01.175 --> 25:03.210
What's yours?

25:03.278 --> 25:04.711
It's the same.

25:06.514 --> 25:09.249
Except in my version,
the wife waited almost 18 years

25:09.317 --> 25:12.553
to complete her first education.

25:12.620 --> 25:16.523
Her husband had already gotten
his engineering degrees.

25:16.591 --> 25:21.628
Her children already had college
funds put aside for them.

25:21.696 --> 25:25.132
I just don't know how to do it.

25:25.199 --> 25:28.068
Sure, you do.

25:28.136 --> 25:32.406
You just got to convince me
to wait some more.

25:35.877 --> 25:37.544
Where you going?

25:37.612 --> 25:39.680
Going back to sleep.
I hate this dream.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.315
I'm gonna get me another.

26:02.737 --> 26:03.870
Yep?

26:03.938 --> 26:05.639
Hey. You got a minute?

26:05.707 --> 26:07.774
Sure. What's going on?

26:07.842 --> 26:10.644
Well, I... I just noticed
that you're still interviewing

26:10.712 --> 26:12.946
for that assistant D.A.
position.

26:13.014 --> 26:15.048
Yep. It's a shame
you don't have your degree.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.249
You'd be perfect for it.

26:16.317 --> 26:20.520
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

26:20.588 --> 26:22.956
So how about a raise?

26:23.024 --> 26:26.460
Okay.
Let's start over.

26:26.527 --> 26:28.929
Well, that's the thing.
We can't really start over.

26:28.997 --> 26:32.299
I'm never gonna be 24 again.

26:32.367 --> 26:35.669
I'm never gonna be one of these
kids fresh out of law school,

26:35.737 --> 26:38.005
but at least I could
still get my degree.

26:38.072 --> 26:40.374
I could still get my license
to practice.

26:40.441 --> 26:41.875
I just... I just need

26:41.943 --> 26:43.894
to get some money together
for tuition and...

26:43.978 --> 26:45.912
Okay, Allison,
let me stop you there.

26:45.980 --> 26:49.049
There is not one dime
in the city budget, in my budget

26:49.117 --> 26:51.551
that hasn't already
been spoken for-- twice.

26:51.619 --> 26:54.254
If I could get it for you,
I would, but...

26:54.322 --> 26:56.189
It's okay.

26:56.257 --> 26:58.258
Another life.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.527
Yep.

27:01.546 --> 27:03.463
I heard you were both here.

27:03.531 --> 27:04.931
Thought you'd want to know.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.933
We found the Collings girl
this morning.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.436
Well, that's good news,
isn't it?

27:09.504 --> 27:11.338
She was found
at Riverside Park.

27:11.406 --> 27:14.141
Buried in a children's sandbox.
Buried in a playground sandbox.

27:15.410 --> 27:17.577
That's, that's all I know.

27:17.645 --> 27:21.181
I-I didn't even realize
that I knew that.

27:21.249 --> 27:22.983
Her poor mother...

27:23.051 --> 27:25.419
Cause of death appears
to be multiple stab wounds.

27:25.486 --> 27:28.321
The only good news in all this
is that the knife

27:28.389 --> 27:30.824
used to kill the girl
was found buried with the body.

27:30.892 --> 27:31.825
And?

27:31.893 --> 27:32.959
And we got a partial print

27:33.027 --> 27:33.960
from the handle.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.963
They both point
to the same guy...

27:37.031 --> 27:39.499
your new neighbor
Clark Kerwin.

27:42.306 --> 27:43.706
Coroner counts
16 stab wounds,

27:44.695 --> 27:46.165
one for every year
that she was alive.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.063
My God.

27:47.064 --> 27:48.832
There's also some
bruising consistent

27:48.899 --> 27:51.935
with a sexual assault.

27:52.002 --> 27:54.704
Is that the knife?

27:54.772 --> 27:56.289
Yeah.

28:05.115 --> 28:08.985
I'm sorry, but none of this
makes any sense to me.

28:09.053 --> 28:11.121
What doesn't make sense
to you?

28:11.188 --> 28:14.390
I'm not convinced that he raped
that girl ten years ago,

28:14.458 --> 28:15.859
much less killed this girl.

28:15.926 --> 28:17.227
Okay, let's start
at the beginning.

28:17.294 --> 28:19.095
What's this about
ten years ago?

28:19.163 --> 28:20.296
I had a dream.

28:20.364 --> 28:21.965
In it, he didn't do anything.

28:22.032 --> 28:25.068
It was all a setup.
The girl was angry.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.303
He was her teacher.
He didn't give her

28:27.371 --> 28:28.571
the grade that she wanted.

28:28.639 --> 28:30.406
Okay, all right.

28:30.474 --> 28:32.242
Let's say that was the case.

28:32.309 --> 28:34.611
Nonetheless, Kerwin did spend
ten years in prison.

28:34.678 --> 28:36.513
And prison changes a person,
Allison.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.081
Not always for the better.

28:38.149 --> 28:41.017
It's funny that you suddenly
believe in this guy so strongly.

28:41.085 --> 28:42.652
Why?

28:42.720 --> 28:44.621
'Cause when we picked
him up this morning,

28:44.688 --> 28:45.822
he didn't want his lawyer,

28:45.890 --> 28:46.890
didn't want
the public defender.

28:46.957 --> 28:50.994
All he wanted to do
was speak with you.

28:53.764 --> 28:56.166
Mr. Kerwin?

28:56.233 --> 28:58.601
They told me
you wanted to see me.

28:58.669 --> 29:01.171
You said it was gonna be okay.

29:01.238 --> 29:02.772
You still say that?

29:02.840 --> 29:07.544
They found your fingerprints
on the knife.

29:10.214 --> 29:12.749
I know you showed me her picture
the other day,

29:12.817 --> 29:16.085
but I don't even remember
what she looked like.

29:16.153 --> 29:17.787
I don't even remember her name.

29:17.855 --> 29:21.558
Hayden.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.960
Her name was Hayden.

29:27.798 --> 29:30.200
You said it was
gonna be okay.

29:30.267 --> 29:31.734
I was wrong.

29:31.802 --> 29:34.671
That's it?

29:34.738 --> 29:36.539
That's all you have
to say to me?

29:36.607 --> 29:41.377
No.

29:41.445 --> 29:42.946
Get a lawyer.

29:48.519 --> 29:49.736
Mrs. Dubois...

29:49.820 --> 29:52.121
my friend at the
District Attorney's office.

29:53.591 --> 29:56.526
Susannah, I realize we don't
know each other well, but

29:56.594 --> 30:00.029
I just want to tell you
how sorry I am about your loss.

30:00.097 --> 30:03.433
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

30:03.500 --> 30:05.235
Do for me?

30:05.302 --> 30:07.403
When that man moved
into the neighborhood,

30:07.471 --> 30:10.073
I begged you and the people
you work with

30:10.140 --> 30:12.475
to do something for me.

30:12.543 --> 30:13.543
When Hayden disappeared,

30:13.611 --> 30:15.778
I pleaded with you
and that detective

30:15.846 --> 30:17.580
to go down to that house,

30:17.648 --> 30:19.916
make that animal admit
that he'd taken her.

30:19.984 --> 30:24.120
How do I know
she wouldn't still be alive

30:24.188 --> 30:27.457
if you and your colleagues
had marched down there

30:27.524 --> 30:32.362
guns drawn, demanded
he tell you where she was?

30:32.429 --> 30:35.398
No, I'm sorry.

30:35.466 --> 30:38.902
The offer's a little late.

30:43.974 --> 30:45.642
Thank you.

30:45.709 --> 30:47.076
Hypothetical question.

30:47.127 --> 30:48.745
That's my favorite
kind. Shoot.

30:48.812 --> 30:50.446
Okay, all right,
so in this scenario,

30:50.514 --> 30:52.498
there's this guy,
who, he brings home

30:52.583 --> 30:54.784
most of the money
into his household, right?

30:54.852 --> 30:55.985
Breadwinner.
Got it.

30:56.053 --> 30:58.821
And this guy has an
opportunity, a good one.

30:58.889 --> 31:00.890
The hypothetical breadwinner
has an opportunity

31:00.958 --> 31:03.960
to bring home
a lot more bread.

31:04.011 --> 31:06.462
The problem is, if he goes
through with this,

31:06.530 --> 31:07.630
his hypothetical wife has

31:07.681 --> 31:09.766
to give up an opportunity
of her own.

31:09.833 --> 31:11.401
One that means
a lot to her.

31:11.889 --> 31:13.830
And the hypothetical guy
can't get his wife

31:13.930 --> 31:17.297
to understand that he's not
actually doing this to be selfish.

31:17.373 --> 31:19.041
He's doing it for her.

31:19.284 --> 31:20.549
Are there hypothetical
kids involved?

31:20.738 --> 31:21.772
Hypothetical
college tuitions?

31:22.663 --> 31:24.314
Yes, absolutely.

31:24.381 --> 31:26.616
Oh, well, I gotta say

31:26.684 --> 31:28.551
this one doesn't sound
too complicated.

31:28.619 --> 31:31.554
He's just gotta talk
common sense to the woman.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.157
Like, there are
two opportunities:

31:34.224 --> 31:36.659
whichever one's gonna bring
more money into the family,

31:36.727 --> 31:38.661
that's the one
that has to prevail.

31:38.729 --> 31:41.097
We're grown-ups, Joe. "Dream?"

31:41.165 --> 31:43.433
That's a word that one
of these kids would use.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.702
What if his wife doesn't agree
with his logic?

31:45.769 --> 31:47.804
Well, first of all, she should.

31:47.871 --> 31:49.973
She's a part of this family,
too, right?

31:50.040 --> 31:52.709
She should be capable
of making a tough decision

31:52.776 --> 31:54.744
that's for the greater good.
That's right.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.313
And I mean that's what this
is really about, right?

31:57.381 --> 31:58.581
The greater good?

31:58.649 --> 32:00.850
He's got to do what's
best for his family.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.218
That's right.
His whole family.

32:05.255 --> 32:07.056
Yeah.

32:07.124 --> 32:09.726
Thank you
for picking me up.

32:09.793 --> 32:11.227
I guess we have
old-fashioned kids.

32:11.295 --> 32:14.464
They just like the idea
of having a dad.

32:14.531 --> 32:17.367
That's funny.

32:17.434 --> 32:20.536
So, listen, I need
to talk to you.

32:20.604 --> 32:23.606
I've made a decision.

32:23.674 --> 32:26.342
I'm gonna go
to business school.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.778
I'm gonna go into
my boss tomorrow,

32:28.846 --> 32:31.381
I'm gonna thank him
for thinking of me

32:31.448 --> 32:34.617
and ask him to go ahead
and make a call on my behalf.

32:36.453 --> 32:38.988
I understand if you're upset.

32:39.056 --> 32:43.126
I hate the fact that law school
is not gonna work out right now,

32:43.193 --> 32:46.696
but this is really
the right decision.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.831
This really is
for the greater good.

32:48.899 --> 32:51.567
It really is.

32:51.635 --> 32:53.169
If you say so.

32:53.236 --> 32:54.203
I guess I do.

32:54.271 --> 32:56.105
I guess I say so.

32:56.173 --> 32:58.374
All right, what do you say?

33:00.377 --> 33:01.978
What, me?

33:02.046 --> 33:03.079
Not much.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.515
I mean, I don't
have much to say,

33:05.582 --> 33:07.850
not right now.

33:07.918 --> 33:10.053
It's late,
and I'm tired.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.472
And my husband just
called me out of the blue

33:12.556 --> 33:14.891
to come pick him
up from a bar.

33:14.958 --> 33:17.126
Not to mention there's a
16-year-old girl who lives

33:17.194 --> 33:19.862
around the corner from us who
was just brutally murdered.

33:19.930 --> 33:22.231
So while my husband's
out drinking

33:22.299 --> 33:25.334
and deciding the
future of our family,

33:25.402 --> 33:28.604
I am at home trying to
calm down our daughters

33:28.672 --> 33:32.208
so I can get them to finish
their homework and go to bed.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.509
So I'm sorry.

33:33.577 --> 33:35.678
You know what, I'm gonna
have to just get back to you

33:35.746 --> 33:38.047
on why that, that might
be the stupidest thing

33:38.115 --> 33:40.450
that you've
ever said to me!

33:40.517 --> 33:42.318
And the greater
good my ass!

34:03.841 --> 34:05.641
Hi, there.

34:05.709 --> 34:07.543
I saw the moving
vans this morning,

34:07.611 --> 34:08.878
so I figured we must have had

34:08.946 --> 34:10.246
a new addition
to the neighborhood.

34:10.313 --> 34:11.246
Yeah.

34:11.313 --> 34:13.116
I'm just getting settled in.

34:13.183 --> 34:14.484
Oh, that's great.

34:14.551 --> 34:17.053
We're so glad someone
finally bought this place.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.588
Um, I'm Susannah Collings.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.456
I'm from down 157.

34:20.524 --> 34:22.625
Hi. I'm Clark.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.342
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Clark.

34:24.428 --> 34:26.996
I know you're busy moving in,
so I won't keep you,

34:27.047 --> 34:29.549
but I made you cake.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.766
Just my way of saying,
"Welcome to the neighborhood."

34:31.835 --> 34:34.570
Wow. Thanks.

34:34.638 --> 34:37.072
I wasn't sure if you unpacked
your kitchen things yet,

34:37.141 --> 34:39.559
so I brought you
a little care package.

34:39.643 --> 34:41.177
Some plates, some utensils.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.745
Just drop them by
when you're done.

34:42.813 --> 34:43.880
Okay.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.148
Nice to meet
you, Clark.

34:45.215 --> 34:48.016
I'm sure we'll be seeing
a lot of each other.

34:48.068 --> 34:50.085
Bye.

35:03.570 --> 35:05.110
Susannah gave Clark Kerwin that knife.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.320
She gave it
to him the day

35:06.388 --> 35:07.955
that he moved in.
She pretended she didn't know

35:08.023 --> 35:09.790
who he was;
she knew exactly who he was.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.109
She even printed out his picture
from the sex offender registry.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.360
Wait a minute.

35:13.428 --> 35:15.262
She wanted to make friends
with a sex offender?

35:15.330 --> 35:18.999
She wanted to set him up
for her daughter's murder.

35:19.067 --> 35:20.835
She wanted him
to return that knife

35:20.902 --> 35:22.536
with his fingerprints on it.

35:22.604 --> 35:24.822
She knew if she did a good
enough job setting him up,

35:24.906 --> 35:26.957
we wouldn't even think
to look for another suspect.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.710
And you know what,
she was right, we didn't.

35:29.778 --> 35:31.912
The minute we found
his prints on that knife,

35:31.980 --> 35:34.048
the case was
as good as closed.

35:34.115 --> 35:35.816
But, Allison,
Hayden Collings' body

35:35.884 --> 35:37.451
was savaged with this knife.

35:37.519 --> 35:39.286
And I just can't believe
that a mother

35:39.354 --> 35:40.621
could do that
to her own daughter.

35:40.689 --> 35:42.857
Okay, Hayden was not
Susannah's daughter,

35:42.924 --> 35:44.859
she was her stepdaughter.

35:44.926 --> 35:46.176
I did some research
this morning.

35:46.261 --> 35:48.729
Hayden's real mother died
of leukemia when she was five.

35:48.797 --> 35:50.965
Her father married Susannah
a few years later.

35:51.032 --> 35:53.634
He died in a car accident
18 months ago.

35:53.702 --> 35:55.669
He left his entire life savings
to Hayden,

35:55.737 --> 35:57.471
to be kept in a trust
that matured

35:57.539 --> 35:58.939
the day that she turned 18.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.642
But in the event that Hayden
predeceased her stepmother...

36:01.710 --> 36:03.777
All of it goes to Susannah.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.916
I'm in the middle of something.

36:08.984 --> 36:11.151
All right, put him through.

36:13.622 --> 36:15.522
Yes, sir.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.158
No.

36:18.226 --> 36:20.895
I see.

36:20.962 --> 36:22.096
Thank you.

36:23.832 --> 36:27.334
That was the precinct captain
over at the Arroyo jail

36:27.402 --> 36:29.670
where they were holding
Clark Kerwin.

36:31.573 --> 36:34.508
He hung himself in his jail cell
less than 30 minutes ago.

36:42.851 --> 36:44.618
Hey.

36:44.686 --> 36:45.686
Hey.

36:47.389 --> 36:49.390
You reading about
our neighbor?

36:49.457 --> 36:52.293
I just heard about
it in the car.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.694
He didn't kill this girl.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.596
He didn't rape
the other one either.

36:55.664 --> 36:56.864
You did the
best you could.

36:56.932 --> 36:58.933
Maybe.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.634
What's this?

37:00.702 --> 37:01.635
That's my plan.

37:01.703 --> 37:03.637
That's my financial plan.

37:03.705 --> 37:06.173
That's how much tuition
and how many classes I can take

37:06.241 --> 37:08.409
if I use just my salary.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.311
I submitted
my application today.

37:10.378 --> 37:12.546
You know,

37:12.614 --> 37:14.982
maybe it's egomaniacal,
but I can't help but think

37:15.050 --> 37:17.551
maybe if I was actually
a practicing attorney instead of

37:17.619 --> 37:21.555
whatever it is I am, maybe
Clark Kerwin would be alive.

37:21.623 --> 37:23.691
Maybe his legacy would
be a lot of young people

37:23.758 --> 37:25.326
he'd educated instead of this.

37:27.262 --> 37:29.096
I left you some tuna noodles
in the refrigerator.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.031
I'm going to bed.
I'll see you in there.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.034
Hey, you know what,
if you're smart,

37:34.085 --> 37:35.285
you'll keep your
hands to yourself

37:35.370 --> 37:36.303
the next couple days.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.174
Now, you know the details
of your parole.

37:40.275 --> 37:41.508
No contact with the victim.

37:41.576 --> 37:43.310
No attempts
to contact the victim,

37:43.378 --> 37:44.812
even through a third party.

37:44.879 --> 37:45.946
And you've got ten days

37:46.014 --> 37:47.848
to inform the community
of your presence.

37:47.916 --> 37:50.417
Now, I'm required to be there
when you put up the fliers,

37:50.485 --> 37:52.586
so let me know
when you want to do that.

37:52.654 --> 37:54.888
Questions?

37:54.956 --> 37:56.256
Yeah, I got questions.

37:56.324 --> 37:59.626
Why you people forcing me
to brand myself as a pariah?

37:59.694 --> 38:01.328
I don't deserve this.

38:01.396 --> 38:02.429
I didn't hurt anybody.

38:02.464 --> 38:03.897
I didn't even touch anybody.

38:03.965 --> 38:06.967
We've been over this, Dale.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.669
You're a stalker.

38:08.737 --> 38:11.071
You ignored repeated warnings
to stop harassing

38:11.122 --> 38:12.673
that woman
you used to work with.

38:12.741 --> 38:14.108
Then you trespassed
on her property

38:14.175 --> 38:16.210
and videotaped her
through her bedroom window.

38:16.277 --> 38:19.546
Now, every single one of those
established facts is a crime.

38:19.614 --> 38:22.149
Doesn't matter whether
you touched anyone or not.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.685
I've admitted
I got carried away.

38:24.753 --> 38:26.053
I've paid the price for it.

38:26.121 --> 38:27.054
"Carried away"?

38:27.122 --> 38:29.957
Dale, the police found, what,

38:30.025 --> 38:32.526
250 hours of
illegally obtained footage

38:32.594 --> 38:34.261
on your computer
when they arrested you.

38:34.329 --> 38:36.963
That's not
getting carried away.

38:37.015 --> 38:40.100
That's a pattern of behavior.

38:40.168 --> 38:42.569
Carried away.

38:42.637 --> 38:45.439
Let me know when you find work.

38:45.507 --> 38:47.775
Don't hold
your breath.

38:48.810 --> 38:51.612
Who'd hire me?

38:53.214 --> 38:54.998
What?

38:55.083 --> 38:57.418
You forgot to leave
more forms for me to fill out?

38:59.454 --> 39:00.554
Hi, neighbor.

39:00.622 --> 39:01.955
I saw the moving van.

39:02.023 --> 39:03.090
I wanted to stop by

39:03.158 --> 39:05.859
and welcome you
to our little neck of the woods.

39:09.164 --> 39:11.932
So, you just met Dale Oleck.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.934
Clark, what are you doing here?

39:14.002 --> 39:16.437
Came to tell you
a story about Dale.

39:16.504 --> 39:20.007
Turns out, he moved into
a housing development

39:20.075 --> 39:23.644
on the other side of the highway
about nine months ago.

39:23.711 --> 39:26.180
Our favorite neighbor Susannah

39:26.247 --> 39:29.183
went to welcome him, too.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.484
Same idea.

39:30.552 --> 39:34.388
Brought him a cake,
gave him a knife.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.758
Problem was, Dale never bothered
to return the knife

39:37.826 --> 39:40.761
once he was done
with the cake.

39:40.829 --> 39:42.062
Misanthropic perverts

39:42.130 --> 39:44.598
can be wanting
when it comes to manners.

39:44.666 --> 39:46.233
Why are you telling me this?

39:46.301 --> 39:50.337
You've probably gleaned Dale's
got an obsessive personality.

39:50.405 --> 39:54.875
Stalking that receptionist
at his office that way.

39:54.943 --> 39:57.978
You know, deep in his heart,
he actually believed

39:58.046 --> 40:00.747
she loved him.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.983
Why are you telling me
all of this?

40:03.051 --> 40:06.220
Flash forward.

40:06.287 --> 40:10.991
He does his time, he moved into
a house couple of miles away.

40:11.059 --> 40:14.628
And lo and behold,
a nice lady stops by

40:14.729 --> 40:16.330
and brings him a cake.

40:16.397 --> 40:19.199
Pretty.

40:19.267 --> 40:20.501
Friendly smile.

40:20.568 --> 40:24.037
And a new obsession was born.

40:24.105 --> 40:25.606
What are you saying?

40:25.673 --> 40:28.575
Are you saying that Dale Oleck
is stalking Susannah?

40:28.643 --> 40:30.611
For months now.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.746
He bought himself
a new video camera,

40:32.814 --> 40:35.582
figured how to sneak
into her yard.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.584
Records everything he can.

40:37.652 --> 40:41.455
Matter of fact, he got
some pretty interesting footage

40:41.523 --> 40:42.723
the other night.

40:42.790 --> 40:47.027
Susannah Collings
covered in blood.

40:47.095 --> 40:50.230
Her stepdaughter bleeding
to death on the kitchen floor.

40:50.298 --> 40:52.299
Oh, my God.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.268
You talking to me?

40:54.335 --> 40:56.286
No.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.571
Well, would you
like to talk?

40:57.639 --> 40:58.572
I'd like to talk.

40:58.640 --> 40:59.973
I think we have
a few things

41:00.041 --> 41:01.208
we should talk about.

41:01.276 --> 41:02.476
Where you going?

41:02.544 --> 41:03.577
I got to call my boss,

41:03.645 --> 41:05.078
see if I can get
a search warrant.

41:05.146 --> 41:06.947
I think I figured a way
to nail Susannah

41:07.015 --> 41:08.015
for her stepdaughter's murder.

41:11.619 --> 41:12.586
Oh.

41:12.654 --> 41:14.087
Okay.

41:14.155 --> 41:15.088
Don't worry.

41:15.156 --> 41:16.423
It'll keep.
