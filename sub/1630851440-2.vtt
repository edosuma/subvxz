If you need my help,

01:09.375 --> 01:10.375
just tell me.

01:53.125 --> 01:53.958
Mom.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.291
How's Dad?

01:58.458 --> 02:00.208

I'm sorry, Mom.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.625
<i>I don't know what this is all about.</i>

02:23.833 --> 02:27.458
<i>It might have something
to do with his work.</i>

02:33.500 --> 02:36.500
<i>So how are you? How are you doing now?</i>

02:39.041 --> 02:40.208
I'm fine.

02:42.416 --> 02:43.416
Don't worry.

02:44.958 --> 02:48.375
I'm going to find out
what all of this is about.

02:54.791 --> 02:59.541
Today at Ruampalangjai Foundation Temple,
a chanting rite is being held

02:59.625 --> 03:02.166
dedicated to all the victims

03:02.250 --> 03:05.875
who were killed in the accident
in front of the bus terminal.

03:05.958 --> 03:10.125
The Ruampalangjai Foundation
and Mr. Wat Auajitsamran,

03:10.208 --> 03:13.250
the owner of Wattanakarn, are the hosts.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.291
-Hello, Wat.
-Hello.

03:15.791 --> 03:16.625
Hello.

03:18.416 --> 03:19.458
My condolences.

03:36.208 --> 03:39.125
JIRAYU PRAISOONG

03:50.333 --> 03:51.416
Thank you for coming.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.041
Did you get into a fight?

03:55.583 --> 03:56.416
It's nothing.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.125
I'll leave after the chanting rite.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.833
I'm not very welcome here.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.000
I only came here because of you and Jo.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.125
Take a lot of pictures.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.041
Okay.

05:09.291 --> 05:12.416
Hey, what happened to you?

05:14.500 --> 05:18.333
I myself lost my precious son…

05:20.125 --> 05:22.041
in an accident on the roads of Bangkok.

05:26.166 --> 05:29.041
That's why…

05:31.041 --> 05:34.250
I dedicate myself to philanthropy,

05:35.500 --> 05:36.833
offering my support…

05:38.250 --> 05:41.916
and donating money
to the Ruampalangjai Foundation.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.208
This time, the Ruampalangjai Foundation

05:47.083 --> 05:50.333
has lost one of its finest members

05:51.458 --> 05:54.083
in Jirayu Praisoong, or Jo.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.666
I want to say one thing.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.750
I knew Jo very well.

06:02.416 --> 06:08.166
This young man was a true volunteer.

06:08.916 --> 06:14.416
I believe with all my heart
that Jo never meant anyone any harm

06:14.500 --> 06:19.750
and that he never thought
of taking the life of anyone's loved one.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.833
I'd like to take this opportunity
to express my deepest condolences to those

06:26.916 --> 06:29.125
who have lost someone dear to you.

06:30.125 --> 06:34.375
I promise you that I'll do everything

06:35.500 --> 06:36.916
that I can possibly do

06:38.125 --> 06:42.500
to raise road safety standards

06:43.208 --> 06:44.708
and make them better.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.125
Let this tragedy

06:48.208 --> 06:51.333
be a motivation for me and my team

06:52.458 --> 06:54.291
to do our very best

06:55.083 --> 06:58.250
for all our friends,
brothers, and sisters.

07:09.041 --> 07:12.375
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Pratheep Saengtharnsong.

07:12.458 --> 07:15.291
I am here on behalf
of the Ruampalangjai Foundation.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.500
Next, we will hold the siren ceremony
in memory of the deceased.

07:20.583 --> 07:24.916
Excuse me. Do you have
any leads on the sports car yet?

07:26.583 --> 07:30.625
The foundation hasn't received
any further reports on this matter.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.958
Does that mean it's possible
that the car didn't belong to Jirayu?

07:34.708 --> 07:36.500
I'm afraid the foundation

07:37.125 --> 07:40.291
doesn't have much information
on Jirayu's personal life.

07:40.375 --> 07:46.291
However, Jirayu's brother
might have an answer for you.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.625
What can you tell us?

07:47.708 --> 07:49.708
Was it really Jirayu's car?

07:53.875 --> 07:59.250
Please stand up
and pay your respects to the deceased.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.958
That was so hectic.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.291
Reporters are annoying like that.

08:11.375 --> 08:14.208
Hey, why are you criticizing
our own people?

08:14.958 --> 08:16.583
This is Sek. He's a photographer.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.000
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.833
Wanchai,

08:23.041 --> 08:25.375
where did the reporters
get the information about your brother?

08:29.875 --> 08:30.958
I don't know.

08:31.541 --> 08:34.375
But I don't believe
that Jo was driving that car.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.458
Before I came to Bangkok,

08:41.208 --> 08:43.916
Jo sent me a message
saying he needed help.

08:45.583 --> 08:46.833
About what?

08:46.916 --> 08:48.250
I don't know what it was about.

08:49.291 --> 08:53.666
But after what happened last night,
I think it might be related to his work.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.333
Last night?

08:58.291 --> 09:00.708
Don't tell me the reason
you're in that terrible condition…

09:02.666 --> 09:03.625
What happened?

09:06.291 --> 09:07.458
Wanchai?

09:11.375 --> 09:12.208
It's nothing.

09:15.958 --> 09:19.250
All right, I'll get going then.

09:30.416 --> 09:31.250
Oh.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.375
Wanchai.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.166
Can you give me your number?

09:38.458 --> 09:39.958
So we can keep sharing information.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.958
Let me tell you something.
She's an entertainment reporter.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.125
Don't mind her.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.541
I'll be going then.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.000
Okay.

10:11.541 --> 10:15.041

-Fuck you!

10:52.875 --> 10:55.000
I'll get you!

10:57.125 --> 10:58.291
Hey!

10:59.083 --> 11:02.000

-Hey, he's not letting up, is he?

Are you coming?

12:22.458 --> 12:24.208
Wait. Look.

12:25.541 --> 12:27.708
-Are you sure? Who is it?
-No.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.250
What is he doing there?

12:31.166 --> 12:32.500
He's either high or crazy.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.375
Excuse us.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.333
Cheep, is he going to jump or what?

12:37.916 --> 12:39.916
He's been shaking
like that for a while now.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.083
He's not talking.
I think he's high on drugs.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.541
-Does anyone know him?
-Who is he?

12:47.625 --> 12:49.291
Who knows the guy up there?

12:49.375 --> 12:51.125
-I know him.
-What?

12:51.208 --> 12:52.750
-Come here then.
-Come here.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.750
Is he high or is he mentally ill?

12:55.833 --> 12:57.583
He's not high. He's afraid of heights.

12:57.666 --> 12:58.750
What?

12:59.375 --> 13:00.458
Why is he up there?

13:00.541 --> 13:03.625
Well, my husband came back,
so he climbed out…

13:03.708 --> 13:05.208
-What?
-Your husband?

13:05.291 --> 13:06.541
I see.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.500
Well, he climbed out, and…

13:09.583 --> 13:11.708
He's afraid of heights.
He's scared to go back.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.666
I see.

13:14.750 --> 13:18.291
So this is a romantic situation.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.166
-Between three people.
-That's right.

13:20.916 --> 13:22.083
Oh, my.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.791
-His neck is red.
-Guys, let's go back.

13:24.875 --> 13:28.166
-Let's go. It's nothing.
-Just calm down.

13:28.250 --> 13:31.125
Stay still. The rescuers
are coming up to help you.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.041
Chai.

13:33.916 --> 13:37.666
I heard you were visited by Hardcore.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.750
Make sure you do as he says.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.583
It shouldn't be a problem.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.083
Remember that.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.625
Hi, honey.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.750
I thought I had missed you.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.791
Come on. Come here. Sit down.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.333
Want some chicken?

14:51.375 --> 14:52.208
No.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.375
Do you remember what I told you?

15:01.791 --> 15:05.500
That you and your family owe me.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.625
You do what I tell you to, okay?

15:13.750 --> 15:14.750
What if I don't?

15:31.916 --> 15:35.500
Oh, no.

15:36.291 --> 15:37.208
Asshole.

15:38.666 --> 15:39.791
I almost ruined your good looks.

15:43.541 --> 15:47.791
If you don't disobey me, I won't
lay a hand on your handsome face.

15:47.875 --> 15:48.875

Deliver this to the storage room
at the Jaitham Foundation.

16:03.250 --> 16:07.625
Don't act confused. You've gotten to know
people at the foundation, haven't you?

16:10.208 --> 16:11.416
What?

16:11.500 --> 16:12.625
My goodness.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.000
Don't you know what mooncakes are?

16:20.791 --> 16:22.625
Surprise.

16:24.541 --> 16:27.125
Crystal meth to celebrate
the moon festival, okay?

16:29.125 --> 16:31.083
Why should I deliver this?

16:34.375 --> 16:36.583
You're not in a position to negotiate.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.208
It's not your job to ask me.

16:48.833 --> 16:53.333
Do you want me to call Kiew
and tell him to visit your parents again?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.875

The alley is so narrow.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.291
What do we do, Dad?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.041

<i>The fire is spreading to the upper floors.</i>

23:45.833 --> 23:47.708
<i>Sak, someone's hurt.</i>

23:47.791 --> 23:48.625
Let's go.

23:49.291 --> 23:50.958
-Let's go, Koh.
-Okay.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.208
What's the current situation?

23:58.791 --> 23:59.833
<i>Ms. Reporter.</i>

24:01.375 --> 24:03.625
Why are you butting in when we're working?

24:03.708 --> 24:05.375
Give it back. Give it back to me.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.208
Give my phone--

24:08.916 --> 24:09.958
Don't do that.

24:14.125 --> 24:16.125
Is this asshole acting tough?

24:16.208 --> 24:17.083
Look.

24:19.791 --> 24:24.291
Chai, I hope we're not
going to have a problem.

24:34.750 --> 24:35.583
Help!

24:43.291 --> 24:44.375
It's a child.

24:45.416 --> 24:46.958
Help! There's a child upstairs!

24:47.041 --> 24:48.458
-Where?
-There she is.

24:48.541 --> 24:50.125
There. Look.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.708
<i>There's a child upstairs.</i>

25:04.125 --> 25:07.291
Help! My daughter is trapped in there.

25:09.958 --> 25:11.166
Please save my sister.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.750
There she is! Help, somebody!

25:19.458 --> 25:21.291
Please save my sister.

25:21.375 --> 25:24.208
Help! There's a child trapped up there!

25:24.291 --> 25:25.750
Help!

25:26.333 --> 25:27.166
Hurry up!

25:28.666 --> 25:29.500
Everyone.

25:31.583 --> 25:34.041
-Are you okay?
-Help!

25:34.125 --> 25:35.916
Help! Somebody help!

25:39.583 --> 25:41.583
Somebody, help!

26:33.416 --> 26:34.250
I'm up here.

27:45.000 --> 27:45.833
Where are you?

27:47.708 --> 27:49.125
Make some noise for me!

27:53.250 --> 27:54.458
Help is on the way.

28:02.375 --> 28:03.291
Where are you?

28:09.750 --> 28:10.583
Hello?

28:14.291 --> 28:15.458
Help is on the way.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.250
My daughter.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.833
Please save my sister.

28:46.916 --> 28:48.041
-Help!
-Wanchai!

28:49.333 --> 28:50.375
Wanchai, come out!

28:50.458 --> 28:52.041
-Let the rescuers do their work.

NOT IMPRESSED, DEFINITELY A SET-UP

HE WAS SUICIDAL

34:38.583 --> 34:39.750
I WANT TO LAY ON HIS CHEST

34:47.833 --> 34:50.916
A MIDDLE-AGED RESCUER RUDELY STOPS
A REPORTER FROM FILMING THE FIRE

35:04.166 --> 35:05.000
What is this?

35:08.416 --> 35:11.041
Well, it's the footage
from the fire last night.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.541
I mean this video.

35:22.708 --> 35:25.875
I happened to be at the scene,
so I live-streamed it.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.666
Hundreds of thousands of people shared it.

35:30.583 --> 35:31.541
Ms…

35:33.375 --> 35:35.250
Kat, isn't it?

35:36.333 --> 35:37.541
What department are you in?

35:38.375 --> 35:39.500
Entertainment.

35:39.583 --> 35:40.666
Is this entertainment?

35:42.958 --> 35:45.875
Where are the celebrities?

35:46.625 --> 35:48.333
Can you sell a video like this?

35:49.083 --> 35:50.375
-But--
-Ms. Kat.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.875
Do you know how much debt
the company had when I joined?

35:56.041 --> 35:58.666
Do you know why I had
to lay off hundreds of employees?

36:01.041 --> 36:02.750
How much debt are we in? Take a guess.

36:04.583 --> 36:05.750
Guess.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.250
-No.
-Two billion baht.

36:09.916 --> 36:11.416
And those employees…

36:13.791 --> 36:17.041
They were like cancerous growths

36:18.541 --> 36:19.875
in the company.

36:20.416 --> 36:23.041
I had to step in like a surgeon.

36:24.708 --> 36:26.375
I had to preserve the good parts.

36:29.083 --> 36:32.625
You're still considered
a good part, a useful part.

36:34.375 --> 36:36.416
But you have to do your job properly.

36:40.958 --> 36:44.333
But what I did has been shared
hundreds of thousands of times.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.916
Since I'm a reporter here,

36:47.500 --> 36:50.000
isn't this a good thing for Matimuanchon?

36:50.083 --> 36:53.625
If the media like us wants to adapt
and attract more attention from people,

36:54.666 --> 36:56.625
close coverage of social issues

36:56.708 --> 36:59.208
is better than celebrity gossip, isn't it?

36:59.291 --> 37:01.458
-Kat.
-It's all right, Mr. Wee.

37:03.375 --> 37:07.500
Ms. Kat is still ignorant.
She doesn't understand real life yet.

37:08.958 --> 37:13.333
If you don't want to do your job properly,
please take a long hard look at yourself

37:13.416 --> 37:18.166
and see if you're worthy of being part
of the country's top media organization.

37:22.958 --> 37:25.958
What about you? Are you worthy?

37:27.666 --> 37:29.125
Kat, wait. Kat.

37:32.291 --> 37:35.750
I apologize on that
kid's behalf, Mr. Artorn.

37:35.833 --> 37:39.041
I… Let me talk to her.

37:41.416 --> 37:43.708
For your sake, Mr. Wee,
she has one more chance.

37:44.291 --> 37:46.250
-Yes, sir.
-Only one.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.333
Yes, sir. Thank you.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.875
Do you want to join me?

38:57.583 --> 38:58.916
Can you scrub my back for me?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.375
Don't be a pervert, Aod.

39:00.958 --> 39:04.583
But if it's Wanchai who's asking…

39:04.666 --> 39:06.791
You're the pervert, Po. Go take a shower.

39:06.875 --> 39:09.208
Taking a shower with you
would make me the cleanest.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.458
Can you handle me?
My boobs are big, you know.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.166
Gosh.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.875
-What the hell?
-Let's go. Can you handle it?

39:15.958 --> 39:17.708
Sure thing.

39:17.791 --> 39:20.333
Can you handle big boobs?
This doesn't concern you, Aod.

39:34.125 --> 39:34.958
Wanchai.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.291
Yes.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.333
According to the rules,

39:40.833 --> 39:43.166
rescuers shouldn't do
something that dangerous.

39:49.041 --> 39:50.041
But you were very brave.

39:52.875 --> 39:57.500
You know, you remind me
of the time Jo and I worked together.

39:58.791 --> 40:00.458
You and Jo have the same passion.

40:01.791 --> 40:03.250
I can see it clearly now.

40:06.291 --> 40:09.916
You would make
a good rescuer if you're interested.

40:15.916 --> 40:18.958
All right, members of the Jaitham team.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.791
Let's go eat.

40:23.541 --> 40:24.833
-Let's go.
-I'm hungry.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.416
-Come on.
-Hi, how are you?

40:29.500 --> 40:31.000
-Gosh.
-Are you tired?

40:33.125 --> 40:36.333
Come on, the hero is here.

40:36.416 --> 40:38.791
Here, have a seat. Get us more chairs.

40:41.666 --> 40:43.000
-Hello.
-Hello.

40:43.083 --> 40:46.875
Look, our hero is here too.
You're so famous now.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.208
Hey, grab a chair and sit down.

40:50.958 --> 40:54.166
Excuse me. Can I take a selfie with you?

40:56.333 --> 40:57.458
-Me?
-Yes.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.083
Let's take a selfie.

41:02.083 --> 41:04.833
What the hell? Why are they doing that?

41:04.916 --> 41:07.166
One more time. Smile.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.291
This is unusual.

41:08.375 --> 41:10.125
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks.

41:10.208 --> 41:14.208
I get it now.
It's because of this. Take a look.

41:15.666 --> 41:17.958
Hey.

41:18.041 --> 41:20.833
Hey.

41:20.916 --> 41:22.083
You have the face for it.

41:22.166 --> 41:23.416
It's you.

41:24.458 --> 41:26.750
It's Wanchai. My gosh.

41:26.833 --> 41:29.458
Hey, the news says
Wanchai is in Jaitham too.

41:30.583 --> 41:32.708
-Is it fake news?
-No, it's not.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.166
-Here's some duck for you.
-Here.

41:36.458 --> 41:37.500
Knock yourselves out.

41:37.583 --> 41:40.333
-Great, Mom.
-Enjoy.

41:40.416 --> 41:41.875
I'll eat it all by myself.

41:41.958 --> 41:45.000
-I'm hungry.
-Calm down. Put that down.

41:45.083 --> 41:46.708
-I just want to say--
-Guys, look.

41:47.416 --> 41:49.541
Hey, the donations keep coming in.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.916
How much is it? I'm shortsighted.

41:53.500 --> 41:54.666
It's six figures.

41:54.750 --> 41:55.708
Hey!

41:55.791 --> 41:57.791
Is it really, Aod? Is it?

41:57.875 --> 41:59.041
Yes.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.708
-Hey.
-My gosh.

42:01.791 --> 42:03.208
Six figures. That's amazing.

42:03.916 --> 42:06.458
Should we get new outfits?
Something cooler.

42:06.541 --> 42:08.833
It looks so shabby in the video.

42:08.916 --> 42:11.458
-That's a great idea.
-Come on.

42:11.541 --> 42:13.750
-Here, I have something in mind.
-Let me see.

42:13.833 --> 42:16.041
Like this. What do you think?

42:16.916 --> 42:18.375
I like it. It's cool.

42:18.458 --> 42:19.583
How about a new hat too?

42:19.666 --> 42:22.208
Can we have a new color for the hat?

42:22.291 --> 42:26.250
-Right.
-Like this.

42:26.333 --> 42:28.500
-New shoes.
-Here are the shoes.

42:28.583 --> 42:30.791
The old ones give me blisters.
I can't wear them.

42:30.875 --> 42:32.458
How many times have I told you?

42:33.250 --> 42:34.416
What?

42:35.666 --> 42:38.541
We can't spend donation money
on unnecessary things.

42:40.833 --> 42:43.875
That money comes from the faith
of those who appreciate our work.

42:43.958 --> 42:46.958
We should use this money
for something that benefits society.

42:50.125 --> 42:53.333
I'm sure people want
to see us in cool clothes, Dad.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.541
Is that the top priority?

42:59.708 --> 43:04.458
What's your top priority
if not the members of the team?

43:07.833 --> 43:12.791
Cheep, take it down a notch. Okay?

43:12.875 --> 43:15.500
Come on. Let's eat.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.916
Aod, pass out the plates.

43:25.875 --> 43:28.041
Excuse me.

43:28.125 --> 43:29.833
Are you Wanchai?

43:30.500 --> 43:31.333
Yes.

43:34.458 --> 43:36.041
I was asked to give this to you.

43:38.666 --> 43:39.625
Who is it from?

43:41.125 --> 43:42.125
I don't know.

43:43.791 --> 43:45.291
Man, you're so awesome.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.083
I'm a big fan.

43:48.166 --> 43:49.208
Okay.

43:50.208 --> 43:52.375
I'll get going then. Thank you.

44:13.458 --> 44:18.083
COME SEE ME TONIGHT
AT 7:00 P.M. IF YOU CAN.

44:30.291 --> 44:33.583
Please follow me.
Walk slowly. There's plenty of room.

44:33.666 --> 44:36.458
The innovations you see here
on the left and right

44:36.541 --> 44:40.500
are all ISO 9002 certified.

44:40.583 --> 44:44.958
And most importantly,
every single one can be connected

44:45.041 --> 44:46.291
to an application

44:46.375 --> 44:50.041
which we, at Wattanakarn,
have developed ourselves.

44:50.125 --> 44:53.958
With our drones or all-terrain vehicles,

44:54.041 --> 44:56.833
whenever there is an emergency,

44:56.916 --> 44:59.833
there will be an alert in our system

44:59.916 --> 45:01.666
through the Global Positioning System,

45:01.750 --> 45:02.583
or GPS.

45:02.666 --> 45:05.375
This will allow us to arrive at the scene

45:05.458 --> 45:07.791
and save lives rapidly.

45:07.875 --> 45:09.625
Please follow me this way, everyone.

45:10.750 --> 45:11.833
This way, please.

45:15.458 --> 45:18.625
This is part of the research
and development department.

45:18.708 --> 45:21.208
Our R&D.

45:21.291 --> 45:24.166
What you see here is
an unprecedented innovation.

45:24.750 --> 45:28.791
It provides security and increases safety

45:28.875 --> 45:32.666
for all passengers
in any form of transport.

45:33.916 --> 45:35.416
This is so comprehensive, Wat.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.916
Thank you, sir.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.333
Sir, if I'm awarded the concession

45:40.416 --> 45:43.875
to maintain and implement
safety on the main roads

45:43.958 --> 45:46.500
across our capital city,

45:46.583 --> 45:51.083
I promise that I will install CCTV systems

45:51.166 --> 45:52.625
for all the agencies

45:52.708 --> 45:54.708
under your administration

45:54.791 --> 45:56.458
free of charge.

45:57.375 --> 46:00.791
In any case,
I will support you as much as I can.

46:00.875 --> 46:03.541
That's great. Please follow me, everyone.

46:03.625 --> 46:05.666
-I'll show you the next phase.
-Okay.

46:05.750 --> 46:06.708
This way, please.

46:17.041 --> 46:19.333
Hey, wait.

46:19.416 --> 46:22.083
It's a 1988 Bordeaux, isn't it, Kwan?

46:22.750 --> 46:23.750
-That's right.
-Okay.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.083
Am I doing it right?

46:28.166 --> 46:29.000
You are.

46:29.875 --> 46:32.208
I swirl it around like this, right?

46:32.291 --> 46:35.000
Kwan, I'm interested in that kid.

46:35.750 --> 46:39.625
He's Bakjo's brother.
He's from my hometown.

46:39.708 --> 46:42.541
SOCIAL MEDIA HERO, A BRAVE MAN
WHO WALKED THROUGH FIRE

46:44.958 --> 46:51.083
RUAMPALANGJAI FOUNDATION

46:58.833 --> 46:59.666
Cheep.

47:01.333 --> 47:02.500
You're here at last.

47:03.666 --> 47:06.208
What's wrong? Why the long face?

47:07.083 --> 47:08.333
You fought with your dad?

47:10.666 --> 47:12.375
Forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

47:14.291 --> 47:16.000
Is your dad really not here?

47:17.000 --> 47:20.166
He's been gone since the afternoon.
He won't be back until late.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.125
Come on, let's go inside.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.125
That's so cool.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.250
Jaitham is no match.

47:42.916 --> 47:47.250
Of course not. Dad said
Jaitham will never prosper

47:47.750 --> 47:50.125
because your dad is old-fashioned.

47:53.083 --> 47:53.916
That's true.

47:54.583 --> 47:56.541
Come on, let's go inside.

47:57.875 --> 47:59.041
Let's go.

47:59.125 --> 48:00.083
TO RUAMPALANGJAI SHRINE

48:00.166 --> 48:01.000
ROLLED NOODLES

48:18.083 --> 48:20.041
What did you wish for?

48:21.666 --> 48:22.500
You.

48:24.583 --> 48:25.416
You're crazy.

48:28.958 --> 48:30.083
Do you think…

48:32.041 --> 48:33.208
I'll get my wish?

48:46.125 --> 48:47.416
Hey, what are you two doing?

48:48.125 --> 48:48.958
Dad.

48:52.416 --> 48:53.250
Hello.

48:54.166 --> 48:57.875
Dad, Cheep just came
to hang out for a little while.

48:57.958 --> 49:00.333
I invited him here.

49:01.250 --> 49:04.666
Please don't be mad at him. Please.

49:04.750 --> 49:07.291
PRATHEEP SAENGTHARNSONG,
HEAD OF RESCUE TEAM

49:07.375 --> 49:08.875
I haven't said anything to him.

49:12.916 --> 49:16.041
Don't be scared.
You didn't do anything wrong.

49:18.416 --> 49:21.250
If your dad hadn't left this place,

49:22.375 --> 49:25.083
we would be like family now.

49:25.708 --> 49:26.541
Right?

49:27.250 --> 49:32.250
Go home and tell your dad to lose his ego.

49:33.125 --> 49:34.083
The truth is,

49:35.208 --> 49:38.125
he and I have the same goal.

49:39.416 --> 49:41.208
We want to contribute to society.

49:42.041 --> 49:45.250
If we can work together,
it will benefit society.

49:46.958 --> 49:47.875
Okay.

49:48.708 --> 49:51.958
Push it all the way in. That's it.

49:52.041 --> 49:53.416
Let's get a big one.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.625
-A big one?
-Yes, it's too small.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.458
Three.

50:06.833 --> 50:07.791
What is it?

50:07.875 --> 50:10.875
<i>Sak, I'm only going to tell you this once.</i>

50:12.125 --> 50:14.208
You tell your son, Cheep,

50:16.208 --> 50:18.166
to stay away from my daughter.

50:18.958 --> 50:19.791
<i>Do you understand?</i>

50:33.791 --> 50:37.750
Can you take this inside for me?

50:37.833 --> 50:38.666
Sure.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.333
Thank you.

50:56.166 --> 50:58.791
What's the matter?
Ask me if you need to know anything.

51:00.833 --> 51:01.666
It's nothing.

51:14.375 --> 51:15.208
Write it down.

51:17.791 --> 51:19.666
Can we pick this up tomorrow?

51:36.041 --> 51:37.833
-Do we need anything else?
-No.

51:37.916 --> 51:39.458
That's all for now. That's enough.

51:50.458 --> 51:51.291
Kat.

51:53.958 --> 51:57.333
Hey, boss, are you here
to take care of your celebrity?

52:05.541 --> 52:06.625
It's hot. Be careful.

52:10.625 --> 52:12.083
Do you want some bael juice?

52:16.958 --> 52:18.250
It's not poison.

52:19.333 --> 52:21.291
Why do you look so scared?

52:35.125 --> 52:36.833
I came to see how you were doing.

52:42.541 --> 52:43.375
Wanchai.

52:44.250 --> 52:45.500
You can call me Chai.

52:47.583 --> 52:48.583
Chai.

52:54.750 --> 52:58.708
You know I want information
about rescue workers.

52:59.291 --> 53:02.500
If you have anything useful,
please let me know.

53:05.333 --> 53:06.166
Okay?

53:12.833 --> 53:13.666
Sure.

53:23.625 --> 53:24.833
We're a team, okay?

53:26.541 --> 53:27.875
You look into the rescuers.

53:28.583 --> 53:32.583
I'll help you find out
about the sports car, okay?

53:35.208 --> 53:36.291
Okay, we're a team.

53:51.458 --> 53:53.791
All right.

53:53.875 --> 53:56.375
Who wants a mooncake?

54:00.250 --> 54:01.583
My goodness.

54:01.666 --> 54:04.916
Hey, Pipo, wait until everyone's here.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.083
-Let's share the good stuff.
-I'm impatient.

54:07.666 --> 54:10.916
Here we go.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.875
Ta-da.

54:17.916 --> 54:18.916
Don't they look good?

54:20.208 --> 54:22.541
Come on, Kat. We can have one each.

54:22.625 --> 54:24.791
-Can I take a look first?
-Go ahead.

54:24.875 --> 54:26.083
-What flavor?
-This one

54:26.166 --> 54:29.875
has durian filling.
I know it's your favorite.

54:29.958 --> 54:31.291
You have such a good memory.

54:32.291 --> 54:33.250
Of course.

54:34.500 --> 54:35.583
I didn't read the package.

54:39.291 --> 54:41.166
-It's all gone.
-You don't get one.

54:41.250 --> 54:42.083
Share it, okay?

54:42.166 --> 54:45.291
You should work out. Come on.

54:45.375 --> 54:48.333
I used to suspect Somsak.

54:49.916 --> 54:53.833
But seeing him today,
he seems like a good guy.

55:00.291 --> 55:01.666
I feel the same way.

55:05.125 --> 55:08.000
But you can't tell what someone
is like just by looking at them.

55:11.666 --> 55:15.250
Chai, don't give up on your brother yet.

55:18.916 --> 55:19.750
Thank you.

55:20.833 --> 55:23.916
Don't forget that we're a team now.

55:24.583 --> 55:25.833
Call me if anything happens.

55:34.833 --> 55:35.791
It's an old car.

55:37.958 --> 55:39.000
-It will work now.
-Let me.

55:40.083 --> 55:40.916
Here you go.

55:41.458 --> 55:42.333
Come on.

55:48.166 --> 55:50.000
Okay. Take care.

55:50.083 --> 55:50.916
Thank you.

55:52.291 --> 55:53.125
You're so good.

56:04.166 --> 56:06.541
Everyone, I'm leaving.

56:06.625 --> 56:07.833
-Bye, Sak.
-Bye.

56:07.916 --> 56:09.000
Hey, bye.

56:09.083 --> 56:10.458
-Bye.
-Get home safely.

56:10.541 --> 56:11.375
-Okay.
-Go on.

56:34.583 --> 56:36.375
Hi, honey.
