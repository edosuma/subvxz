00:01.127 --> 00:02.584
Gordon:
<i> Previously on "masterchef"...</i>

00:02.628 --> 00:04.294
Joe: Tonight you have
a team challenge.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.672
Your future in this competition
depends on these people.

00:06.716 --> 00:08.924
<i> Nick was captain</i>
<i> for the red team,</i>

00:08.968 --> 00:10.509
<i> michael for the blue.</i>

00:10.553 --> 00:12.335
Joe:
It's time to teach your teams

00:12.346 --> 00:14.346
how to make
a three-course italian meal.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.682
Yes! Let's go, blue!

00:16.726 --> 00:20.769
The team that will be
safe from elimination
is the red team.

00:20.813 --> 00:22.855
Aarón:
Blue team, you have to prove

00:22.898 --> 00:26.191
that some of you still deserve
to be in this kitchen.

00:26.235 --> 00:30.029
Hey, nick! You have a very,
very important decision to make.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.947
-<i> Tonight...</i>
- Switch!

00:31.991 --> 00:34.241
<i> ...It's the elimination</i>
<i> challenge the home cooks</i>

00:34.285 --> 00:36.160
<i> have been fearing all season.</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:38.746
It's the famous
tag team challenge.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.457
- Oh, lord.
- Two of you will be
going home.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.417
When it says hell
is a burning lake of sulfur?

00:43.461 --> 00:45.794
That is what
the tag team challenge is.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.047
It's season ten.
We're taking it higher.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.300
This challenge makes a chef
or breaks a chef.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.302
- You're not ready to go home.
- No, I'm not!

00:53.345 --> 00:55.512
- 3...
- This was the most chaotic

00:55.556 --> 00:57.380
- thing I've ever experienced.
- 2...

00:57.391 --> 00:59.391
Please respect our intelligence
and don't bring us crap.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.102
- 1...
- I haven't ever witnessed
something like this.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.104
- Switch!
- ( screams )

01:06.859 --> 01:10.652
<i> ( music playing )</i>

01:16.327 --> 01:18.327
let's go, blue team.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.829
I was the captain
of the losing team,

01:20.873 --> 01:25.167
<i> and I do feel like I deserve</i>
<i> this elimination challenge.</i>

01:25.211 --> 01:30.380
<i> I just have to trust today</i>
<i> in my ability to cook.</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:34.218
Blue team, this is the moment
that you all have been dreading.

01:34.253 --> 01:35.719
Put those black aprons on.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.888
Dorian:<i> As frustrating</i>
<i> as it is for me</i>

01:37.932 --> 01:40.599
<i> to be cooking for my life</i>
<i> with this black apron on,</i>

01:40.643 --> 01:44.019
<i> I have to remember</i>
<i> that I'm here for a purpose.</i>

01:44.063 --> 01:47.940
And to make that choice
to leave your family,

01:47.983 --> 01:50.642
to come out
and to follow a dream

01:50.653 --> 01:52.277
<i> is not easy to do.</i>

01:52.321 --> 01:54.696
<i> So I'm going to push</i>
<i> through it.</i>

01:54.731 --> 01:57.783
Today, we want you
to work together

01:57.827 --> 02:02.371
in teams of two
in a "masterchef" classic.

02:02.414 --> 02:07.000
- Bring it, bring it.
- It's time for the famous
tag team challenge.

02:07.035 --> 02:08.043
Uh-oh.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.921
Renee:
<i> Holy freaking crap.</i>

02:10.965 --> 02:12.047
When it says hell
is a burning lake

02:12.091 --> 02:13.549
of freakin' sulfur?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.300
<i> That is what</i>
<i> the tag team challenge is,</i>

02:15.344 --> 02:19.296
and my butt is not going to be
down there and get burned.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.099
In this challenge,
you either talk or you walk.

02:22.143 --> 02:26.937
So, listen,
because tonight two of you

02:26.981 --> 02:29.314
- will be going home.
- Wow.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.609
You couldn't drop
a bigger bombshell.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.278
I was not expecting
that at all.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.238
<i> The judges, they're setting</i>
<i> the standard up.</i>

02:36.282 --> 02:38.740
Nick, because you were
the winning captain

02:38.784 --> 02:41.451
of that incredible three-course
italian fine dining challenge,

02:41.495 --> 02:46.790
you get to pair
the eight home cooks
into teams of two.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.417
Come and join us three
down here, please.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.044
- All right.
- Oh! Moving up.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.505
Having to decide
the fate of the blue team,

02:53.549 --> 02:55.883
<i> it's a huge decision to make,</i>

02:55.926 --> 02:57.384
<i> and two people</i>
<i> are going home tonight.</i>

02:57.428 --> 03:00.637
The equation of this pairing
is in your hands.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.264
Let's start off with sam.

03:02.308 --> 03:05.642
Who would you put
alongside sam?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.895
Nick: I'm going to put
sam with shari.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.938
- Shari. Wow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:09.982 --> 03:14.151
I paired sam with shari
because they're both
very soft-spoken people,

03:14.195 --> 03:18.155
<i> and success</i>
<i> in the tag team challenge</i>
<i> requires communication.</i>

03:18.199 --> 03:20.866
Let's look at
the second pairing.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.492
Who are you going to
place with dorian?

03:22.536 --> 03:25.829
I want to stick her
with subha.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.331
- Oh, my god.
- No.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.498
Subha, swap places
with noah, please.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.543
- Dorian.
- Yes, chef?

03:31.587 --> 03:34.254
- How are you feeling?
- It's sabotage.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.923
I honestly think
that's sabotage.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.008
But I understand it.
It's a competition.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.135
Partnering with me
is sabotage?

03:40.179 --> 03:41.595
<i> Where is the team spirit?</i>

03:41.639 --> 03:43.263
The only way that subha and I

03:43.307 --> 03:45.766
will be able to beat this

03:45.809 --> 03:49.770
is if subha can take direction
and ask questions.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.396
Nick:
Dorian, I think if subha

03:51.440 --> 03:53.482
is managed correctly
in the kitchen,

03:53.517 --> 03:54.775
he's probably one
of the strongest cooks here.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.027
- Thank you.
- We'll see.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.029
Subha, how are you
feeling right now?

03:59.073 --> 04:01.615
I'm hoping that dorian
and I could work together.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.200
Tonight, you got
to find your voice.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.819
- Yes. Yes.
- Remember that.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.829
Okay. So, noah.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.790
After seeing
the first team challenge

04:09.875 --> 04:11.541
of having sarah and noah
as captains,

04:11.585 --> 04:14.086
I am really curious
about what the dynamic would be

04:14.129 --> 04:16.129
if they were on a team,
so I want to put them together.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.547
Wow.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.924
Nick:
<i> Of all the competitors here,</i>

04:18.968 --> 04:20.926
noah stands out
as the alpha male

04:20.970 --> 04:23.053
and sarah stands out
as the alpha female.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.264
And I think as a team
sarah and noah will clash

04:25.307 --> 04:27.140
and go down right away.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.184
- Alphas, baby.
- Gordon: So, our final team--

04:29.228 --> 04:31.144
- michael, liz.
- Yep.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.188
I want to see an intensity
from them tonight

04:33.232 --> 04:35.357
that I don't think
I've seen yet in the kitchen.

04:35.401 --> 04:38.610
Nick, head upstairs to
the safety of the balcony.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.029
Thanks, nick.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.406
( clears throat )

04:42.449 --> 04:45.450
gordon:
Smart picks. Well done.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.663
Understand this,
"masterchef" is the world's
favorite cooking competition.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.416
It's aired across the world.

04:52.459 --> 04:57.296
- And tonight...
- Ooh-la-la.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.964
...You'll be cooking
some of our favorite dishes

04:59.049 --> 05:02.301
from all of our sister shows.

05:02.344 --> 05:06.763
From the philippine islands,
a beautiful pork spring roll.

05:06.807 --> 05:11.810
From india,
we have vegetable samosas
with a mint chutney.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.647
From Italy, we have
the most amazing meatballs.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.108
- From mexico...
-<i> Orale.</i>

05:18.152 --> 05:19.151
We--

05:21.905 --> 05:25.741
we have a beautiful fish taco
with pico de gallo.

05:25.784 --> 05:30.120
From morocco,
the most amazing beef skewers.

05:30.164 --> 05:34.249
And from china, the most
exquisite pork dumplings.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.669
- Nice.
- Beautiful.

05:37.713 --> 05:41.089
I'm scared to death because
I've eaten all of those foods,

05:41.133 --> 05:44.125
but I've never made any of them.
I'm from the midwest.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.262
We make plain chicken
and plain beef.

05:47.306 --> 05:52.300
Tonight, each team will have to
replicate this exact platter.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.643
But that's not quite enough.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.104
- There's more.
- It's season ten.

05:58.984 --> 06:04.863
So you also have to add
one more dish of your very own

06:04.907 --> 06:05.989
to that platter.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.784
Oh, come on.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.162
Shari:
<i> Finding out we have to add</i>
<i> another item to this tray?</i>

06:12.206 --> 06:14.206
<i> I'm already feeling</i>
<i> a bit defeated.</i>

06:14.249 --> 06:17.876
I have been on
every losing team so far,

06:17.920 --> 06:21.296
<i> and I hate leaving my fate</i>
<i> in other people's hands.</i>

06:21.340 --> 06:23.215
Right, all of you,
please head to your stations.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.258
Noah:
<i> Me and sarah being</i>
<i> paired together</i>

06:25.302 --> 06:28.595
is a match made in heaven.
She's an alpha operator.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.473
<i> I know that when I need</i>
<i> to get my ass kicked in gear,</i>
<i> she's going to do it.</i>

06:31.517 --> 06:32.974
When I'm going to
kick her ass in gear,

06:33.018 --> 06:34.267
I'm going to yell
at her a little bit

06:34.311 --> 06:37.345
because I don't kick women.
So, let's go.

06:37.356 --> 06:41.316
On your stations you'll find
everything that you need

06:41.360 --> 06:45.529
to make our around the world
platter of delicious bites.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.824
You'll also have access
to our pantry

06:48.867 --> 06:51.618
to make your seventh dishes.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.736
Joe:
So, take a couple
of minutes now

06:53.747 --> 06:55.872
to discuss and go gather
your ingredients.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.792
If we just do a lamb lollipop,
that'll get the lamb in there.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.920
Immediately,
I think we'll have
those flavors melding.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.549
I was thinking more jerk,
but let's go with the lamb.
I think that's perfect.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.467
Okay, coconut coated
caribbean shrimp

07:07.511 --> 07:09.511
with a little bit
of masala in it.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.972
Listen, dorian's got
an impression that
she makes that in her sleep.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.891
There's indian food,
that's what subha's good--
they can do this.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.601
I'm thinking
I'm going to grab a potato.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.520
I'm going to grab something
to make a tater tot.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.856
- We can make chips
if we have to.
- Chips is weak.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.275
We can do a really
( bleep ) slider.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.318
I made this before.
It's delicious.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.028
I can do a ponzu sauce
with a shrimp tempura.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.655
- Yeah.
- It's just soy sauce,

07:28.699 --> 07:30.115
a little bit of mirin
if I can find it,

07:30.159 --> 07:31.658
and some orange
and lemon juice.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.077
Liz definitely does not
have as much experience

07:34.121 --> 07:36.121
with international food as I do,

07:36.165 --> 07:39.249
so it makes sense for me
to take a little bit of charge

07:39.293 --> 07:40.959
<i> to insure I don't go home.</i>

07:41.003 --> 07:42.544
Right, let's start
breaking away,

07:42.588 --> 07:43.503
getting your ingredients.
Let's go.

07:43.547 --> 07:44.838
Co on, hurry up.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.506
Yes, y'all got it, guys!

07:46.550 --> 07:48.467
Teamwork makes
the dream work.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.634
Oh, my god,
it's already a mix.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.085
Yeah, we won't
need that much.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.804
What else do you need?
Tell me what you need.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.931
- I got all the lamb, so...
- Okay.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.516
Sarah:<i> I want to be</i>
<i> paired with noah</i>

07:56.560 --> 07:59.302
because if there's anything
that's important

07:59.313 --> 08:02.731
with a tag team challenge,
it's constant communication.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.608
Noah doesn't ever
stop talking.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.318
That will never be a problem.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.904
- So we got everything.
- Yeah, we need a blender.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.906
- I got it.
- That one. That one, too.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.282
- This one?
- Yeah.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.160
I absolutely do not
want to be with subha

08:15.204 --> 08:17.787
because he does not
work good under pressure.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.781
- Yeah.
- Subha, you sure
that's everything?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.500
Tamarind, tamarind, tamarind.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.794
- Tamarind. I don't see--
- tamarind. No tamarind here?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.465
- I don't see tamarind.
-<i> And I'm scared that the bulk</i>

08:28.509 --> 08:31.551
of the responsibility
is going to fall on me.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.886
We have perfect
bib lettuce.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.387
- And I did grab buns.
- We have tomatoes.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.889
- I grabbed four buns.
- Is there mayonnaise?

08:35.933 --> 08:38.683
- Let's go! Line up!
- We got to hurry, sam.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.810
Shari:
<i> I'm worried. Sam and I,</i>
<i> we're both really nice.</i>

08:40.854 --> 08:42.354
<i> I think I'm going to have to</i>

08:42.397 --> 08:44.347
<i> just keep telling him</i>
<i> what to do next.</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:46.650
- Did you get shrimp, sam?
- I did get shrimp.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.734
Truthfully,
I think sam's going to

08:47.778 --> 08:49.194
have to do the same for me.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.363
<i> And if we don't</i>
<i> motivate one another,</i>

08:51.406 --> 08:53.657
we're going to
run out of time.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.609
Right, have we all got
everything we need?

08:56.620 --> 08:57.869
- All: Yes, chef!
- Good.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.789
Now, you'll each
take turns cooking.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.416
If you're on the sidelines,
you're there to help.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.920
If you're the one cooking,
listen to your teammate.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.913
When we call "switch,"

09:08.924 --> 09:12.842
you'll tag your partner
and swap out.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.681
You'll have 75 minutes
to make all of your dishes.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.267
Tonight, anything
less than excellence

09:20.310 --> 09:22.143
and you might not
be moving on.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.271
Right, let's get into positions.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.647
Those starting,
stay where you are.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.108
Those finishing,
onto the side, please.

09:28.151 --> 09:32.112
Wuta:<i> This challenge either</i>
<i> makes a chef or breaks a chef.</i>

09:32.155 --> 09:33.780
There's no room for error.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.740
<i> You have to work</i>
<i> together as a team</i>

09:35.784 --> 09:39.077
<i> or you may be going home.</i>

09:39.121 --> 09:40.954
- Is everybody ready?
- Yes, chef!

09:40.998 --> 09:44.082
Your 75 minutes start...

09:48.088 --> 09:49.379
- ...Now! Let's go.
- All right!

09:57.389 --> 09:59.514
Your 75 minutes start...

10:01.351 --> 10:03.727
- ...Now. Let's go.
- Come on, guys!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.520
- All right, liz. Let's go.
- Come on, subha!

10:05.564 --> 10:07.063
First you gotta
get those pots out.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.356
Let's get
those pots out, subha.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.566
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.517
Pots are here, okay.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.695
- Liz, quickly chop
the garlic.
- Okay.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.647
Move faster, move faster.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.824
Doing great, sam.
You got this.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.827
The filipino spring roll
I want to get started on early

10:20.871 --> 10:22.996
<i> because I know exactly what</i>
<i>they're supposed to taste like.</i>

10:23.040 --> 10:26.458
My mother-in-law is filipino,
and she makes it all the time.

10:26.501 --> 10:29.169
So this is something
that I should be able
to knock out of the park.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.588
Great knife skills.
You got that. Perfect.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.049
Look at the knife work!
He's a ninja!

10:34.092 --> 10:35.717
Like a boss.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.762
Noah's starting, because
he's very good at prep.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.139
<i> He has amazing knife skills,</i>

10:41.183 --> 10:43.767
<i> but I have better</i>
<i> plating skills than he does.</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:47.520
So we think it's just
a nice way to get us going
quickly out of the gate.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.815
Tonight is a big, big night,

10:50.859 --> 10:53.068
because tag team challenge--
extremely difficult.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.903
You gotta communicate,
you gotta be fast,

10:54.946 --> 10:56.604
- you've got to
close and finish.
- Absolutely.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.407
Start with
the potatoes, subha.
Use your peeler.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.077
- Yes, yes.
- You don't need to cut them.
There's no ends to a potato.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.746
- Yes, okay.
Got it, got it, got it!
- Okay, come on.

11:04.781 --> 11:06.706
Subha's gonna start,
I'm gonna finish,

11:06.750 --> 11:09.959
<i> because subha gets</i>
<i> flustered with plating.</i>

11:10.003 --> 11:13.296
But out of the gate,
he's already wasting time.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.340
So, how do you
prioritize this platter?

11:15.384 --> 11:17.550
What's the most important
thing you start first?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.511
For me, all the fillings need
to be addressed immediately,

11:19.554 --> 11:22.097
so go for your samosa filling
with the potato mixture.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.516
Gordon: There's an art
in those, guys. Difficult.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.892
I'm gonna work
on the meatballs.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.520
Get that cheese in there.
You got this, sam.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.730
Joe, the italian meatballs,
you've done them in your sleep.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.817
- What's the secret behind them?
- The longer the meatballs
stew in the tomato sauce,

11:33.860 --> 11:36.528
the better they're gonna be.
So the sooner you can get
those meatballs made

11:36.571 --> 11:39.572
- fried, and into the sauce
gives you an advantage.
- Yes, absolutely.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.617
I'm gonna immediately start
making the filipino egg rolls.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.411
We're gonna put a little bit
of the carrot in there.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.621
Ooh, okay.
Take a little back.
Yeah, there you go.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.916
The filipino spring roll,
it's got that pork
filling in there,

11:49.960 --> 11:53.002
so the essence of that
is making sure they're
not too thick.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.754
- It's not easy.
- Just start these kabobs.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.382
Cut it into squares.
Perfect squares.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.926
- I'll prep the pepper!
- Okay, it's right there
in front of you, subha.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.929
- It's right there
in front of you.
- Oh, there it is. Got it.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.764
Now, the moroccan
inspired kabobs,

12:04.808 --> 12:06.641
the secret there is you have
to have everything

12:06.685 --> 12:08.560
in regiment form
in terms of the way it's cut.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.303
One cube too small, too big,

12:10.313 --> 12:11.604
then it's cooking
at different temperatures.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.898
I'm gonna knock out
the dumplings and the stuffing.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.942
How important are those
potstickers, getting
the color on there?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.902
Let me tell you,
there is an art,
there's a finesse to it.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.238
You can't have it overstuffed
and have it too loose

12:20.282 --> 12:21.698
when it comes to the actual
amount of filling.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.825
- You're doing great.
- Thank you, sarah.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.994
You're doing great.
I'm so proud to be
your teammate.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.621
Subha, can you get the grills
out the oven and put 'em on top?

12:28.665 --> 12:32.751
- What's that? Grill?
- Forget it. I'll do it.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.712
Think about the size of
the taco when you cut that.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.505
- That's too big, though.
- What's that?

12:37.549 --> 12:39.424
- Trim it down,
quick, quick, quick.
- Yep.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.301
- The taco?
- What I would like to do

12:41.344 --> 12:43.085
is actually take
those strips of fish,

12:43.096 --> 12:44.220
marinate it
with sufficient time,

12:44.264 --> 12:45.847
make your tortillas
and let them sit,

12:45.891 --> 12:48.975
- and then address
the mango salsa later.
- Right.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.603
- They are making
seven dishes.
- Bri: It's crazy.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.605
I never made a samosa before.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.982
- Hey, salt, salt,
salt, salt.
- Yep.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.860
Gordon:
Thirty seconds to go
until we swap.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.654
- Let's go!
- You know samosas, subha.

13:01.698 --> 13:05.241
- Yes, I'm doing it.
- You have to move with
a sense of urgency.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.409
Move like you're
in a restaurant.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.495
Wait, wait one second.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.413
I need those meatballs rolled
and in the sauce

13:10.457 --> 13:12.040
before you get
out of your station.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.000
- Too big?
- A little big.
Take a little bit out.

13:14.044 --> 13:17.086
- I'm gonna-- yeah.
- What are you gonna
work on next?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.798
I'm gonna get the marinara
going 'cause it's gonna
take time to cook.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.591
- All right, we're
communicating. We got this.
- Noah: We're doing good.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.593
We're gonna be switching
in just a few seconds.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.512
- Good job, sam.
- Aarón: Here we go.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.388
Talk to me
when I'm in there, okay?

13:27.432 --> 13:31.309
Judges:
Five, four, three, two, one.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.604
- And switch!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

13:34.648 --> 13:37.357
- Noah: Okay, sarah.
- Michael: I love it.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.526
Michael, watch the meatballs.
Watch the meatballs.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.696
All right,
nice looking meatballs.
Who formed the meatballs?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.156
Liz got those
meatballs formed.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.158
What is your seventh dish
gonna be?

13:47.202 --> 13:49.536
We're doing
a classic shrimp tempura

13:49.579 --> 13:51.162
with our homemade ponzu sauce.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.289
So I gotta get working
on these sauces really soon.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.667
All right, make sure you taste
as much as you can, okay?

13:55.710 --> 13:57.126
Got it, yep.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.378
- I'm worried for them.
- Yeah.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.922
Okay, get the meatballs
in the sauce.

14:00.966 --> 14:04.092
- They gotta get in there
sooner rather than later.
- Got it. You got it.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.552
- Right, how are you feeling?
- Feeling okay.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.303
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.088
Right now, we have the sauce
for the meatball going,

14:09.099 --> 14:10.473
and we have
the meatball almost made.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.766
It's not quite there yet.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.351
The seventh dish.
What is the dish?

14:13.395 --> 14:15.436
Lucky number seven,
we're gonna go with a slider.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.305
Okay, so, just make sure that
we don't leave each other,

14:17.315 --> 14:19.858
- when we swap out,
a problem.
- Yes, chef.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.193
- Not on the same page,
you're going home.
- Yes, chef.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.987
- Let's go.
- Shari, how are
we doing on samosas?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.989
We're-- I'm getting it
started right now.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.866
Shari and sam,
y'all kick it in the butt.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.567
What do we need to do
for the marinade?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.870
Subha, right now I'm doing
the stuffing for the--

14:31.913 --> 14:34.038
- meatballs, correct. Got it.
- No, not for the meatballs.

14:34.082 --> 14:38.042
- Okay.
- I will be fuming
if she goes home.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.086
Micah:
<i> Subha's not doing anything</i>
<i> of actual use.</i>

14:40.130 --> 14:42.463
You should know what needs
to happen on this dish.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.924
Dorian, talk to me.
Tell me what's in the mind.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.802
( sighs )
I can't look at you.
Just come on.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.638
Not what she's doing,
subha. Think about what
you're gonna do.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.056
Wuta:
Dorian, you got this.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.018
30 seconds to go
until we switch, guys.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.228
Gotta outrun the bear here,
sarah, but we are the bear.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.855
Stand by!

14:58.899 --> 15:02.775
Judges:
Five, four, three, two, one.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.611
- Switch! Let's go!
- Switch!

15:04.654 --> 15:07.071
All right, go ahead.
All right, you got this.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.239
Come on, guys,
you got this.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.699
Nice brunoise.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.868
Remember, I don't know
what any of that means.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.654
- Happy to be safe up here.
- Yeah.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.289
We gotta get
the slider marinated,

15:16.333 --> 15:18.708
otherwise that is not gonna
have that flavor we need.

15:18.743 --> 15:22.003
Gordon:
Just under 45 minutes to go.
Let's go, guys.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.713
Great job, sam.
You're doing awesome.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.799
- I'm so proud of you right now.
- Shari, what a good coach.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.677
It smells awesome. Smell it.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.013
- That smells really good.
- Smells awesome. Yeah.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.640
All right,
what's going on, guys?

15:33.683 --> 15:35.266
- You guys talking?
- Yes, chef. Absolutely, chef.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.936
All right, so you got--
meatballs are cooking.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.437
- Yes, chef.
- That's done.
All right, great.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.688
What is your seventh
dish going to be?

15:40.732 --> 15:42.690
We're gonna be
doing a lollipop.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.400
Who's taking control here?
You guys are two strong voices.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.946
We're melding really nicely.
I feel very calm.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.280
- No one's dominant?
- Just move with purpose.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.240
All right, you just need
three portions, guys.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.284
- Don't go crazy. That's enough.
- Yes, chef. All right.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.995
We're done with that.
Get rid of the ricer.

15:56.039 --> 16:00.583
Subha, subha. Subha.
It's an egg roll, subha.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.378
- Subha, it's an egg roll.
- This is the egg roll?

16:03.421 --> 16:04.629
Set it aside. I'll get it
when I get up there.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.631
I'm gonna dump the peas
in there now.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.967
No, we're not worrying
about the peas right now
for the samosa.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.719
Subha's not listening.
He's not hearing me.

16:11.763 --> 16:15.098
I'm trying to give him
direction, but he's all
over the place.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.975
Cut it up into cubes,
remember?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.352
- Okay, okay.
- The cubes for the kabobs,
remember that?

16:19.396 --> 16:22.355
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay, so cut that meat
into cubes for me, please.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.607
Cut that meat into cubes.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.442
( screams )

16:26.486 --> 16:29.445
- ( bleep )
- dorian:<i> I was a young mom,</i>

16:29.489 --> 16:32.281
<i> I've had to work a ton</i>
<i> of different jobs.</i>

16:32.325 --> 16:34.993
I've struggled hard
to get here.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.037
<i> And I don't know</i>
<i> if subha really wants</i>
<i> to still be here.</i>

16:38.081 --> 16:41.040
I feel like the weight is
totally and completely on me.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.376
- Do you know how to
make a meatball?
- Sorry, wait?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.169
Do you know how to make
an italian meatball?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.046
- Uh, no.
- You don't.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.965
Ooh, I'm so mad right now.

16:49.009 --> 16:52.135
Last 30 seconds.
Get ready, guys.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.845
Put a pinch.
Just a little pinch.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.390
Judges:
Five, four, three, two, one.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.309
- Switch! Let's go!
- Switch!

17:00.353 --> 17:01.561
- Micah: Come on, dorian!
- Gordon: Let's go!

17:01.604 --> 17:05.189
Come on, dorian!
Come on, you can do this!

17:05.224 --> 17:07.275
- You got it, girl.
- Relax, focus.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.068
Don't need to be nervous,
I'm right here.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.404
I'm not nervous
'cause you're right here.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.439
Everything is copacetic.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.075
Copacetic, we got this.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.286
Communication right out
of the gate is flawless.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.371
<i> We are firing</i>
<i> on all cylinders.</i>

17:20.415 --> 17:22.623
Turbo, nos,
we're boosting.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.667
That looks perfect.
That's dead on.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.252
( bleep )

17:26.296 --> 17:29.380
come on, subha!
Speak up, help her.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.757
I don't know
what she's doing.
Dorian?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.341
You don't know
what she's doing?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.802
Wow. Wow.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.971
I'm making meatballs!

17:37.015 --> 17:38.765
- ( bleep )
- okay, okay. All right.

17:41.186 --> 17:44.312
Let's go.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.189
- ( bleep )
- okay, listen,
not the best start.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.649
- No.
- ( exhales )

17:48.693 --> 17:50.526
I've seen you
in the trenches before.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.361
- Yes, chef.
- You've got this.
Come on, dig deep.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.697
What you need to do now,
hey, is take him
under your wing.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.866
Okay, deep breath, okay?

17:56.910 --> 17:59.494
- ( sobs )
- come on, you're not
ready to go home.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.204
No, I'm not!

18:01.247 --> 18:04.540
Dorian, dorian,
let's do it-- come on.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.000
Oh, god.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.055
I've seen you
in the trenches before.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.598
- Yes, chef.
- You're not ready to go home.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.016
No, I'm not!

18:22.060 --> 18:24.435
Let's prioritize
what needs to be done, okay?

18:24.479 --> 18:27.522
- Think about everything you
sacrificed to be here.
- Yes, I did.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.982
- Now just think, think
how important it is.
- Yes.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.318
- Okay, take control.
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.904
- Good girl.
Welcome back. Well done.
- Thank you.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.781
Dorian:
<i> Chef gordon is right.</i>

18:36.825 --> 18:38.449
I have to stay calm

18:38.493 --> 18:41.160
and not let my emotions
get the best of me.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.496
And I want to show
the judges my best.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.206
Dorian, you've got this!

18:45.250 --> 18:47.500
Micah:
You are strong, dorian!

18:47.544 --> 18:50.920
As soon as I jump in,
finishing the lollipops,
cutting them?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.713
Do you know how-- no, don't.
I got it.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.549
All right.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.092
I came into "masterchef"
on a lamb dish.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.718
<i> I cook it a lot at home.</i>

18:57.762 --> 18:59.762
<i> It's my husband's</i>
<i> favorite dish,</i>

18:59.806 --> 19:01.764
but it's taking a lot of time,

19:01.808 --> 19:03.391
<i> and that's making me</i>
<i> really nervous.</i>

19:03.434 --> 19:06.686
Sorry, just--
I'll tell you what,
just let that rest.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.230
- Check the meatballs.
- I'm gonna check it.
I'm gonna put some on, though.

19:09.274 --> 19:13.475
Okay, I think
we're beyond testing.
We just gotta plow through.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.570
- All right.
- Hello, joe. How are you?

19:15.613 --> 19:17.605
All right, sam.
Don't shut down, sam.
Keep talking.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.073
- Hi, chef aarón.
- Where are these meatballs?

19:19.117 --> 19:20.658
The meatballs,
we have the mix right here

19:20.702 --> 19:22.785
and we've already
fried it up.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.079
- You haven't made them yet?
- Those are gonna get made
here soon.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.330
Meatballs do better
when they sit in the sauce.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.416
When they
get in the sauce, yes.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.867
I think they're
a little behind here.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.294
Shari:
<i> We're so behind.</i>

19:31.337 --> 19:33.379
Our time is our worst enemy
right now.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.923
And being here,
this is a dream for me.

19:35.967 --> 19:39.260
<i> I know I can cook,</i>
<i> but I doubt myself a lot,</i>

19:39.304 --> 19:41.596
and tonight is not the night
I want to go home.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.055
Did you marinade
the fish yet?

19:43.099 --> 19:45.349
Um, we have thmarinade done,

19:45.393 --> 19:46.767
but it is not quite
marinated yet.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.102
All right,
here's the deal, guys,

19:48.146 --> 19:50.146
try to get all
of your fillings done,

19:50.190 --> 19:52.523
get your stuff marinating,
all right?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.775
- Thank you.
- All right.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.027
Come on, shari!

19:58.990 --> 20:02.650
We're coming up to 90 seconds
to go until the next switch.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.452
Come on. Let's go.
( gordon claps )

20:04.495 --> 20:06.737
this has not nearly
enough ( bleep ).

20:06.748 --> 20:08.581
There's already salt in there.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.751
I just think they
need a little tiny dust
of cumin on the outside.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.377
Not too much. It's strong.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.129
Stand by!

20:15.173 --> 20:17.256
Dorian, spring rolls,
I'll come back and do that.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.967
- No, no.
- Dorian, it's okay.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.261
- No, subha,
don't worry about this.
- Yes, okay.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.430
- Gordon: Here we go.
- Looking good, sarah.

20:24.474 --> 20:28.684
Judges:
Five, four, three, two, one.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.186
Switch! Let's go!

20:30.230 --> 20:31.604
Get over there
and taste that meat.

20:31.648 --> 20:32.897
Tell me what to do,
all right?

20:32.941 --> 20:35.066
Come on, come on.
Drop-- sarah, drop.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.568
- Taste that
for seasoning, sam.
- Okay, okay, okay.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.488
This is intense.
This is the craziest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.365
I haven't ever witnessed
something like this.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.992
Pinch the sides.
Pinch everything so it
doesn't open.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.695
- Move faster, move faster.
- Just take a deep breath,
come on.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.413
Michael:
<i> We're getting super behind.</i>

20:49.457 --> 20:51.782
<i> We haven't even started</i>
<i> our seventh dish yet,</i>

20:51.793 --> 20:53.751
and I'm really
frustrated right now

20:53.795 --> 20:56.420
because I feel like all of this
is resting on my shoulders.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.798
Leave it to rest like that.
Move on to the next one.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.634
- Subha, start doing--
start doing-- subha.
- Yes?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.636
The shrimp only
take seconds to cook.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.721
We don't have
to do that right now.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.682
- Finish your samosa.
Finish your samosas.
- Yes, okay. I got it.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.016
Set that other stuff aside.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.435
Subha and dorian's team,
like, it's stressing me out

21:11.479 --> 21:13.980
- too much to even go there.
- I can't even look.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.191
Dorian and subha,
it's like watching your parents
go through a divorce.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.359
<i> It's pretty terrifying.</i>

21:18.403 --> 21:20.477
I don't want to use this one.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.571
Subha! Come on!

21:22.615 --> 21:26.158
I don't need to know
where the ricer is.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.703
Right, you need to focus
on your strengths.
What's your strengths?

21:28.746 --> 21:30.538
My strengths is
to make the samosas.
I'm making them now.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.740
The samosas.
That's exactly what
you need to do, okay?

21:32.750 --> 21:35.376
- Yes, absolutely.
- Who showed you how
to make the perfect samosa?

21:35.420 --> 21:38.212
- My mom and my sister.
- And your sister, so you know
what you're doing now, yeah?

21:38.256 --> 21:40.956
- Absolutely.
- Start thinking about that
seventh dish as well.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.176
- What is the dish?
- We're gonna make a coconut
crusted caribbean shrimp.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.304
I know we're behind,
but we can pull
this back, okay?

21:46.347 --> 21:48.723
- Yes, absolutely.
- Come on, guys,
you've got this.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.308
- Let's go, focus.
- I'll work on the sauce
right after this, okay?

21:50.351 --> 21:51.851
I don't know how
to crimp these, do you?

21:51.894 --> 21:53.519
Kinda. I can do it,
I can do it.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.479
Sarah: You're looking good,
you're looking great.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.983
- We got this.
- 60 seconds to go
until we swap!

21:59.027 --> 22:01.235
Just get that ready for me.
I'll do it.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.695
- Here we go.
- Give me one second here.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.488
Don't make a career
out of it, just hurry up.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.158
- This gives a nice little bite.
- I don't care what it gives it.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.785
- I just want it to be done.
- Come on, subha! Yes!

22:09.829 --> 22:13.831
Judges:
Five, four, three, two, one.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.750
- Switch!
- Let's go!

22:15.793 --> 22:19.795
Now I'm doing it
all by my damn self.
What the ( bleep )?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.914
Now crimp it. There you go.
Roll your finger, crimp it.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.716
Perfect, sarah.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.134
So, dorian, you want me
to just boil them, right?

22:25.178 --> 22:27.636
They don't get boiled, subha,
they get fried.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.681
Dear, oh, dear.
Subha and dorian
are a disaster.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.142
Subha could drag her
out of this kitchen tonight.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.853
Liz and michael,
way behind.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.563
They're in jeopardy
of not making it.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.023
These are wrong.
I gotta do it again.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.067
- Oh, goodness.
- ( bleep )

22:41.110 --> 22:43.361
shari and sam
may not be able

22:43.404 --> 22:46.280
- to complete all
seven preparations.
- Shari, at the next switch,

22:46.324 --> 22:49.367
- I'm gonna grill the fish
and grill the beef.
- Okay, sam.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.702
They're literally, like,
a whole step behind
everyone else.

22:51.746 --> 22:55.081
More importantly,
noah and sarah, they've just
put the lamb on the grill,

22:55.124 --> 22:56.916
and I don't know if that
will be cooked in time.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.784
Noah: Little bit of salt,
little bit of pepper.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.294
I'll be throwing the flavor
on it as we go.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.921
40 seconds
till the next switch!

23:01.964 --> 23:04.298
( bleep ).
We need to make the tacos.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.842
We might need to call
an aible with the slider.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.636
At this point, we realize
our seventh dish,

23:08.679 --> 23:10.346
it's out the window.
We're not doing it.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.808
There you go.
Dump it and fry it.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.226
Renee:
Good job, michael!

23:15.269 --> 23:17.228
( snickers )

23:17.271 --> 23:19.772
come on, honey. That's it.
That's it. Perfect.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.232
- This is it.
- Yeah, you can roll
those suckers.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.350
Start getting things
in the fryer.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.361
- Here we come.
- I'll finish them, dorian.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.113
- Dorian, don't worry.
- Judges: Three, two, one.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.489
The taco?
Don't worry about that.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.950
Switch!

23:30.993 --> 23:33.452
I'm actually gonna
have a stroke.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.706
Marinate as we go.
We'll marinate as we go.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.835
- Get the other skewers
on there. We are so behind.
- I know.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.170
- Liz, go, go, go, go, go!
- Michael: Flip those over.

23:43.214 --> 23:46.340
Flip 'em over.
We just gotta get it cooked.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.301
Put the samosa in.

23:49.345 --> 23:52.388
- What's he doing?
- Put the basket in.
Please, lord jesus.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.348
Keturah:
Subha, do the samosa!

23:54.392 --> 23:57.518
- I will get the tacos.
- Okay, all right.

23:57.562 --> 24:01.355
- Subha, leave the tortilla.
- Subha, you're not listening!

24:01.399 --> 24:03.357
Why doesn't he listen?

24:03.401 --> 24:04.567
I absolutely know what
I'm doing in the kitchen.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.068
I've been cooking for 30 years.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.654
<i> But I can't do that</i>
<i> when somebody's coming</i>

24:08.698 --> 24:10.573
back on my neck and shouting
things which I know how to do.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.075
( bleep )
take it off, subha.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.494
- Put it in the form.
- Okay, hold on. Hold on.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.621
Subha, take it off!
You still got it on the heat.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.665
- It's done.
- Okay, hold on.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.417
- It's very thick.
- No, I'm not gonna hold on.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.002
We got six minutes
and four seconds.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.837
- It's very thick.
- Put it in the form, subha.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.715
Subha, put the tortilla
in the form.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.300
Okay, you want me
to put in the form--

24:29.343 --> 24:30.676
oh, ( bleep )!

24:30.720 --> 24:33.429
Subha! Jeez!

24:41.564 --> 24:44.482
Subha, put the tortilla
in the form.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.150
Okay, you want me
to put in the form--

24:46.194 --> 24:47.943
oh, ( bleep )!

24:49.322 --> 24:51.113
- What happened?
- The one tortilla we had,

24:51.157 --> 24:52.490
- he dropped.
- Oh, no.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.534
- 45 seconds to go!
- Wow.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.119
I'm really nervous
for dorian right now.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.078
Really nervous.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.331
My wig is about to come off.

25:00.374 --> 25:05.252
I don't want her to leave
over subha's lack of ability.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.129
Subha, you are not listening.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.256
- I was-- I'm gonna fix this.
- You're not listening.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.508
- Don't shout.
- You're not listening.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.051
I caused
a little bit of drama.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.137
15 seconds to go
until the last switch.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.430
Just get 'em out
if they're done.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.182
- They look good.
- Oh, my god.

25:18.226 --> 25:21.093
Come on, those look good.
Those look great. Come on!

25:21.103 --> 25:23.729
Throw that here on the side.
Come on, come on.
Throw that here, the lid.

25:23.773 --> 25:25.731
- Throw the lid off.
- You might need to tell me--

25:25.775 --> 25:27.858
it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.485
Drop 'em in, all three.

25:29.529 --> 25:33.397
All:
Three, two, one, switch!

25:33.407 --> 25:35.783
Gordon:
Last five minutes, let's go!

25:35.826 --> 25:38.577
Dorian, take over!
Come on, you can do this!

25:38.621 --> 25:39.870
Look awesome,
they didn't explode.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.539
That's what we're
talking about!

25:41.574 --> 25:43.165
For right now, I don't
have time to do them fancy.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.252
No, just get them in.
It's about the flavor.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.754
Two minutes
and 30 seconds left!

25:48.798 --> 25:51.465
Dorian, let's go!
You ain't going home.

25:51.509 --> 25:54.927
- Mangoes. Mangoes and--
- I'm not worried about
no ( bleep ) mangoes.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.179
Shari, shari, one taco's
better than nothing.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.473
- Start plating
some food, guys!
- Let's go.

25:59.517 --> 26:02.050
Shari, plate the meatballs
and grate some cheese on top.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.270
The dumpling, michael.
Get those in there.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.898
- Yeah.
- Set the tortilla in the mold.
Set the tortilla in the mold.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.401
One minute,
15 seconds left.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.695
- I can't watch any of it.
- How long do those take?

26:12.738 --> 26:14.530
It doesn't matter.
I gotta get 'em on the plate.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.365
Wonderful, put it on the plate.
Just put it on the plate!

26:16.409 --> 26:18.325
Liz: You got it, michael!
Come on, you got it. Good job.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.410
Subha:
Meatball on the brown plate.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.287
Yeah, meat
on the brown plate.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.163
Meat on the brown plate.
You've got time.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.916
- Just put it on the plate.
- Hustle, hustle, hustle.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.294
- Twenty seconds to go!
- Finishing touches!

26:28.337 --> 26:29.461
Wuta: Finish strong,
finish strong.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.879
Liz: We got it, michael.
We got it.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.298
- Shari: Your sauces?
- Liz: You got it.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.716
Noah: Let's make it pretty!
Dress the plate.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.092
Parmesan all over
the damn meatball!

26:35.136 --> 26:36.468
Come on,
come on, come on.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.720
Don't forget the salsa
on the shrimp.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.139
- Where is it?
- On this. Sorry.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.974
Dorian, put the fish
on the tacos.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.809
Plate the fish.
Dorian, the fish!

26:43.853 --> 26:47.813
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

26:47.857 --> 26:50.232
- Six, five, four, three...
- What else, sam? What else?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.276
White vinegar.
A yogurt sauce. It's okay.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.312
- ...Two, one, stop!
- Hands in the air.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.113
Jamie:
Dorian, I'm proud
of you, darling!

26:56.157 --> 26:58.824
- Huh?
- We're ( bleep ).

26:58.868 --> 27:00.826
- Everything's on the plate.
- Dorian, you did your best.

27:00.870 --> 27:04.788
Dorian,
look at the other teams.
Dorian, we did awesome.

27:04.832 --> 27:08.083
Dorian:
<i> It's hard putting your fate</i>
<i> in somebody else's hands,</i>

27:08.127 --> 27:11.879
and I'm better than what's
being presented to the chefs,

27:11.922 --> 27:14.465
and I always want
to give them my best.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.343
And today I don't feel
as though they're
getting my best.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.888
Gordon:
Wow, tag team challenge?

27:20.931 --> 27:23.974
That was a tag team meltdown!

27:26.437 --> 27:28.687
Let's taste what's
on those platters

27:28.731 --> 27:31.440
and find out who's cooked
for the last time.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.654
First up, michael and liz.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.451
- Want to take it together?
- No, I'm just gonna--

27:42.495 --> 27:46.163
I'm nervous
'cause I'm worried about
the final cooks on our dishes.

27:46.207 --> 27:47.790
<i> Working with michael,</i>
<i> it was hard,</i>

27:47.833 --> 27:51.293
<i> and what broke down</i>
<i> was the communication.</i>

27:51.337 --> 27:54.546
We have to judge you
on what you give us.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.174
- Right.
- And when you look in there...

27:59.220 --> 28:02.221
- It's raw.
- It's not even seared.

28:02.264 --> 28:07.768
That's dangerous.
When it's not right,
you don't serve it.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.311
Samosas.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.108
What happened to those?

28:18.572 --> 28:21.323
Look at that.
I've got all that
raw dough in there.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.662
You don't need to take
the potatoes so fine to mush.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.957
- Yeah.
- Who didn't crimp these?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.209
I did. I did not, I should say.

28:32.253 --> 28:35.254
And why are they sat
in this oil? What is that?

28:35.297 --> 28:37.673
- It's a sesame oil.
- ( sniffs )

28:39.677 --> 28:42.469
I just got this oil explosion
of sesame seed

28:42.513 --> 28:44.388
that has absolutely
numbed my jaw.

28:44.432 --> 28:45.973
In fact, right now,
I could take a seat,

28:46.016 --> 28:49.768
and pretend I'm at the ( bleep )
dentist, it's that numb.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.228
All, right, I'm gonna start
with this spring roll

28:51.272 --> 28:52.396
'cause this looks a little bit
more promising.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.189
Who took the lead on that one?

28:54.233 --> 28:56.525
I made the filling
and I rolled it and I fried it.

28:58.696 --> 29:02.364
Here's the deal,
it's over, over-saturated
with the aromatics.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.868
- It's really strong.
- Okay.

29:05.911 --> 29:09.413
All right, skewer dish.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.415
The seasoning is unbalanced.

29:11.459 --> 29:15.335
- It's just really
far off the mark.
- This is brutal.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.004
All right, tell me
about these meatballs.

29:17.047 --> 29:19.673
Liz:
So just ground beef,
garlic, panko.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.928
You didn't use egg
either, right?

29:24.972 --> 29:26.138
- No, joe.
- Jeez.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.320
You didn't use egg
either, right?

29:41.363 --> 29:44.573
- No, joe.
- Jeez.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.441
The meatballs are
really hard, really dry,

29:46.452 --> 29:47.993
really difficult to eat.

29:48.037 --> 29:50.412
And the seventh additional
platter was what?

29:50.498 --> 29:51.371
Michael:
We did a shrimp tempura

29:51.415 --> 29:53.540
with a spicy chili
dipping sauce.

29:53.584 --> 29:57.836
- And the chili sauce?
- Sriracha, soy,
and pepper and salt.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.714
I wish you would've
omitted the sauce.
It is so strong.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.633
Joe:
You can't come up here
and fake it and put sriracha

30:02.676 --> 30:04.843
or just soy sauce in a thing
and tell us it's a sauce.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.971
Please respect our intelligence
and don't bring us crap.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.807
- Thank you.
- Wow.

30:09.850 --> 30:12.434
- Wow.
- Thank you, chefs.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.144
Michael:
<i> I'm disappointed.</i>

30:14.188 --> 30:15.604
<i> We just didn't come through</i>
<i> as a team today.</i>

30:15.648 --> 30:17.481
<i> I've worked really hard</i>
<i> to be here.</i>

30:17.525 --> 30:19.191
I'm not ready to go home
right now.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.821
Next up, noah and sarah.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.531
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.282
Sarah:
<i>It was great working with noah.</i>

30:27.368 --> 30:29.076
It was a very
50-50 workload,

30:29.119 --> 30:32.037
and I felt like we communicated
very well together.

30:32.081 --> 30:36.208
But there are parts of every
dish that I'm concerned about.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.168
For me,
it's a bit of a mess.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.504
Both: Yes, chef.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.172
Gordon:
Seventh dish was what?

30:42.216 --> 30:44.716
Noah:
Chinese vinegar
lamb lollipop.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.262
Mine was cooked beautifully.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.680
What you've done
is charred them beautifully,

30:49.723 --> 30:51.223
so I feel like
I got a grilled lamb chop.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.767
- Thank you, chef.
- Good job.

30:53.811 --> 30:56.311
- Who filled the samosa?
- I did, chef.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.022
- So, it's nice and full.
Did you taste it?
- Both: Yes, chef.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.942
I put a little bit more salt
than I normally would.
Hopefully it's right.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.820
- It's good.
- Thank you, chef.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.030
- Who made the dumpling?
- Sarah: I made the dumpling.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.492
- Who seasoned the mix inside?
- Noah flavored the filling.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.444
So, it needs a dipping sauce.
There's no dipping sauce.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.329
But the actually
seasoning's on point.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.873
Thank you, chef.

31:15.916 --> 31:19.084
All right, so, noah,
sarah, spring rolls.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.461
Well, the meat looks
cooked through.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.842
Good flavor.
And now we're gonna
go on to taco.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.552
What'd you season
the fish with?

31:28.596 --> 31:32.347
Cumin, paprika, salt, pepper.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.975
It's not complete.
It needs, obviously,
the mango salsa,

31:35.019 --> 31:40.564
but I think the taco
is a good representation
of what it should be.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.316
All right, so, I'll start
with the skewers.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.776
- Who cooked them?
- It was 50-50.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.446
All right, this is actually
a pretty good medium rare.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.156
Was there any seasoning
put on them?

31:49.199 --> 31:50.616
A little bit of vinegar
just at the end.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.242
The char on the meat's good.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.703
As a simple steak, it's okay.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.456
- Meatballs.
- Sarah: I made the meatballs.

31:57.491 --> 31:59.666
How long did they simmer
in the tomato sauce for?

31:59.710 --> 32:01.585
- About 12 minutes?
- Yeah.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.003
If you had, like, 45 minutes,

32:03.047 --> 32:05.047
it would've raised
the level considerably.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.757
- Both: Yes, joe.
- Thank you.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.966
Thank you all, so much.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.094
- Good job, guys.
- Not bad.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.138
( whispers )
much better than I thought.

32:13.182 --> 32:16.141
Dorian, subha,
let's go, please.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.518
- Go grab it.
- This is the tasting

32:18.562 --> 32:22.230
that we're all waiting for.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.774
Dorian:
<i> I'm feeling defeated,</i>

32:23.817 --> 32:25.692
<i> and I just hope that</i>
<i> the judges see that</i>

32:25.736 --> 32:29.363
in the midst of the chaos
that we are great cooks

32:29.406 --> 32:31.990
<i> and we want to be here.</i>

32:32.034 --> 32:33.742
What on earth happened?

32:33.786 --> 32:36.286
He just gets flustered
under pressure.

32:36.330 --> 32:40.248
I would have to run in
and get us caught up,
and then he would check out.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.751
From the beginning,
we went in with the attitude,

32:42.795 --> 32:44.586
that, you know,
we were going to fail.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.964
So when you have
this spiral attitude...

32:47.007 --> 32:48.298
Who went in with that attitude.
"we're going to fail"?

32:48.342 --> 32:49.633
- Was that dorian?
- As soon as we started,

32:49.677 --> 32:52.344
she got emotional,
she started to cry.

32:52.388 --> 32:53.971
So, you were positive
and she was negative.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.014
- Yes.
- Wow.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.967
Let's be honest, you two
aren't gonna be opening
a restaurant together.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.770
- No.
- But you can work together
for 75 minutes.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.897
Both:
Yes, chef.

33:03.941 --> 33:05.607
I'm amazed you've
got that on a plate.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.359
Visually, you've got
some great colors there.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.528
But there's one big
achilles heel here.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.531
- The fish.
- Fish.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.866
It's a mess.

33:14.910 --> 33:19.204
- So, samosas,
who stuffed them?
- I did, chef.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.831
They look like
a proper samosa.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.585
The seasoning's nice.
Really good.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.797
- Who made the potstickers?
- I did, chef.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.758
- Finally a potsticker
colored on both sides.
- Yeah, perfect.

33:31.802 --> 33:32.759
Aarón: Yeah.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.473
- That's delicious.
- There's no sauce,
though, huh?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.434
- No sauce.
- Too bad. Really good.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.686
Aarón: Who took the lead
on the spring rolls?

33:42.730 --> 33:44.396
I did, chef.

33:47.943 --> 33:48.984
The pork's cooked through.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.862
I like the speckle
of herbs there.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.906
The skewers.
You've got peppers,
you've got red onions.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.451
Very nice medium rare.
Good char.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.703
I think it's the first one
that actually got the marinade

33:59.747 --> 34:01.246
onto the piece
that we're tasting.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.491
This actually came out
very nicely.

34:04.501 --> 34:08.587
- What's the meatball recipe?
- Ground beef,
panko breadcrumbs, eggs.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.590
- Only beef you used?
- Only beef. Salt and pepper.

34:13.427 --> 34:16.136
The marinara sauce with
the grana padano's delicious.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.388
- Who made that?
Perfectly spiced.
- I did.

34:18.432 --> 34:20.432
The seventh dish,
describe it.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.892
Subha:
It's a caribbean shrimp

34:21.935 --> 34:23.518
with some indian spices
mixed in.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.811
It does look good.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.151
- It actually
tastes quite decent.
- Yeah, very good.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.144
That spice is really good.
What'd you spice them with?

34:33.155 --> 34:34.780
Garam masala,
some smoked paprika,

34:34.823 --> 34:37.074
some cayenne pepper,
salt, and pepper.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.533
Joe and gordon:
Thank you.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.786
- How did that happen?
- This flavor and the seasoning

34:40.829 --> 34:42.788
of certain things is so good.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.081
What are you waiting for,
a glass of wine?

34:44.124 --> 34:46.833
- Oh, we're done.
- Thank you, chef.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.043
- Keep your heads up, guys.
- Good job.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.420
- Nice job.
- Good job, guys!

34:50.464 --> 34:53.632
Subha:<i> I'm amazed that</i>
<i> considering all the chaos,</i>

34:53.675 --> 34:56.343
we put out good quality,
tasty food,

34:56.386 --> 34:58.887
<i> which the judges love to eat.</i>

34:58.931 --> 35:01.848
Sam, shari, let's go.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.642
Shari:
<i>This was the most chaotic thing</i>
<i> I've ever experienced,</i>

35:03.685 --> 35:05.927
and I have
two little kids at home

35:05.938 --> 35:08.480
that are constantly
running at my feet
as I'm trying to cook.

35:08.524 --> 35:12.901
<i> I feel like this tray</i>
<i> is doomsday.</i>

35:16.698 --> 35:20.075
75 minutes for that.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.318
I think you both
are strong individuals,

35:22.329 --> 35:27.499
but as a team, diabolical.
Who cooked the samosa?

35:27.543 --> 35:28.834
I believe you threw it
in the fryer.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.837
I did the seasoning
and the shaping.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.714
The seasoning's on point.
Absolutely on point.
Really good.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.091
- Thank you, chef.
- Refreshing.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.593
- Potstickers, who cooked these?
- Sam: I did, chef.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.762
- How long did you
cook these for?
- About five minutes, chef.

35:45.394 --> 35:48.311
( bleep )

35:48.355 --> 35:51.648
- ( bleep )
- what is that?

35:51.692 --> 35:52.858
- Raw.
- It's completely raw.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.287
( bleep )

36:05.330 --> 36:08.373
- what is that?
- It's completely raw, chef.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.878
You feel confident
with the cook on this
spring roll?

36:12.921 --> 36:15.380
Well, after, you know,
the potstickers, no.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.217
- Joe: They got it cooked?
- Yeah.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.514
Here's the deal, apart from
their looking atrocious,

36:24.558 --> 36:27.434
the flavor of the filling
is actually really good.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.060
And now we're gonna
go on to taco.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.983
It's just missing fruit,
missing acid.

36:35.027 --> 36:38.019
- Understood, chef.
- I'm sorry, chef.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.988
What was the recipe
on the meatball?

36:40.032 --> 36:41.907
It was 50-50 beef and pork.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.659
I put some egg in,
some grana padano cheese,

36:44.703 --> 36:47.162
some parsley, salt, pepper.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.539
This is actually
very good, except--

36:49.583 --> 36:51.291
how long did it stew
in the tomato sauce?

36:51.335 --> 36:52.500
15 minutes?

36:52.544 --> 36:55.337
That's not enough.
Too bad.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.589
There's no sauce
on the beef skewers?

36:57.633 --> 36:58.715
- Correct.
- You didn't get to it?

36:58.759 --> 36:59.424
- Mm-mm.
- No, chef.

37:01.929 --> 37:04.638
Aside from being
one-dimensional because
you only put peppers,

37:04.681 --> 37:07.849
the cook on the beef
is actually pretty good,
but incomplete.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.352
And where's our bonus dish?

37:10.395 --> 37:13.104
We didn't get to it, joe.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.889
- Man.
- Oh.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.524
Joe: The flavors
are actually good,

37:16.568 --> 37:19.110
so it's a whole bunch
of stuff that has potential,

37:19.154 --> 37:20.654
but is incomplete.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.364
- Too bad. Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.615
- Thank you, chef.
- Thank you.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.242
Sam:
<i> We failed.</i>

37:25.285 --> 37:27.369
<i> We didn't execute the way</i>
<i> we should have.</i>

37:27.412 --> 37:28.787
And there was supposed to be
a seventh dish

37:28.830 --> 37:31.164
that we didn't even do.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.169
We need a moment to discuss.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.674
I think noah and sarah
came on point.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.009
They had one of the most
together platters,

37:43.053 --> 37:46.263
but the best eating was dorian
and subha in terms of spice.

37:46.306 --> 37:49.307
Joe: You actually can taste
subha's contribution.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.644
I'm more in shock
with michael and liz and sam.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.521
- Aarón: Yeah, me too.
- Joe: And shari.

37:54.564 --> 37:55.847
There's the big no-nos
for me tonight,

37:55.857 --> 37:57.774
with the raw pork wrapped up.

37:57.818 --> 37:59.818
- That's a disaster.
- Raw fish.

37:59.903 --> 38:03.154
Where you do self-edit and say,
"this is not right."

38:14.543 --> 38:17.627
this challenge tonight
was incredibly difficult,

38:17.671 --> 38:21.214
and tonight's
performances shows.

38:21.258 --> 38:26.094
With that said,
two individuals
will be leaving

38:26.138 --> 38:27.721
the masterchef
kitchen tonight.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.809
Noah and sarah,

38:32.853 --> 38:35.854
you guys were far
from great tonight,

38:35.897 --> 38:40.892
but far better
than the rest of the bunch.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.737
And for that, you're safe.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.655
- Woman:
Good job, you guys.
- Yeah.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.991
Woman: Good job.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.534
Noah:
<i> I couldn't be happier.</i>

38:49.578 --> 38:51.077
<i> We were a wolfpack</i>

38:51.121 --> 38:52.579
getting what we needed to get,

38:52.622 --> 38:53.788
moving with purpose.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.709
Dorian and subha...

38:57.753 --> 38:59.586
Complete dysfunctional
teamwork,

38:59.629 --> 39:01.796
but in the food itself,

39:01.840 --> 39:04.424
we tasted good spicing,
good flavors.

39:04.468 --> 39:08.136
We decided...

39:08.180 --> 39:09.545
To keep you
in the competition.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.973
Please head to the balcony.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.767
Dorian:
<i> I worked my tail off.</i>

39:13.810 --> 39:16.478
We didn't do it as beautifully

39:16.521 --> 39:18.855
and as calculated
as we wanted to,

39:18.899 --> 39:20.815
<i> but we got it done.</i>

39:24.738 --> 39:29.240
Right, you four
make your way down,
please. Thank you.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.534
Liz:
<i> I'm nervous because I've been</i>
<i> in the same business</i>

39:31.578 --> 39:34.871
<i> for 35 years doing</i>
<i> the same thing.</i>

39:34.915 --> 39:36.748
But this whole
entire experience,

39:36.792 --> 39:38.541
it's given me
that second chance.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.127
<i> I'm finally following</i>
<i> something that I want</i>

39:41.171 --> 39:43.630
<i> to do for myself,</i>
<i> and it's too soon to leave.</i>

39:43.673 --> 39:46.257
All four of you
fell apart tonight.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.344
Shari and sam,
step forward, please.

39:52.140 --> 39:57.519
Sam, shari,
some fundamental flaws,

39:57.562 --> 40:00.313
but a couple of highlights.

40:00.357 --> 40:01.314
Head upstairs.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.151
Hey, come on.

40:05.195 --> 40:08.863
Michael, liz,

40:08.907 --> 40:10.865
everything left to
the last minute.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.327
Raw fish, a meatball that
you could play golf with.

40:14.371 --> 40:18.665
By far,
your worst performances.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.126
This one hurts for me
personally 'cause I think
you guys have so much potential,

40:21.169 --> 40:25.755
and I just think
this particular challenge
overwhelmed you.

40:25.799 --> 40:29.551
Michael and liz,
you've cooked for the last time
in the masterchef kitchen.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.502
Come up here and say
good-bye, please.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.681
Michael:<i> To make it to</i>
<i> the top 16 of "masterchef"?</i>

40:34.724 --> 40:37.434
<i> It was an honor</i>
<i> and a privilege,</i>

40:37.477 --> 40:39.677
and this is an experience
I'll never forget.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.980
Gordon:
Please put your aprons
on top of your bench.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.482
- I love you, liz!
- Take care, and head home.
Thank you.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.818
Liz:<i> It's sad.</i>
<i> I want to stay till the end,</i>

40:46.862 --> 40:50.321
<i> but I came into</i>
<i> the masterchef kitchen</i>
<i> to learn about myself,</i>

40:50.365 --> 40:52.574
<i> to grow, and I did that.</i>

40:52.617 --> 40:55.743
- It was a blast
out there, michael.
- A hundred percent.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.662
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, guys!

40:57.706 --> 41:00.623
- Bye, everyone!
- Have fun!

41:00.667 --> 41:02.709
- Time to go home.
- I know, right?

41:02.752 --> 41:04.043
Give me a hug.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.259
<i> ( music playing )</i>
