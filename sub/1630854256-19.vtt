10:37.068 --> 10:39.758
He's got cameras
all over the place.

10:39.862 --> 10:41.827
I think he's watching me.

10:43.689 --> 10:45.551
He wants me to go in the water

10:45.655 --> 10:47.482
so I short out
any tracking devices.

10:47.586 --> 10:49.068
Do not go offline,

10:49.172 --> 10:50.758
Agent Callen.

10:50.862 --> 10:52.413
KENSI:
Callen, I know what you want.

10:52.517 --> 10:56.068
Do not let Pembrook manipulate
you into doing something stupid.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.379
[beeping]

11:15.482 --> 11:16.965
We've lost Callen's comms.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.827
You have no control
over your agents.

11:20.758 --> 11:22.379
We can still track him
via his car.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.620
I'll stay close.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.655
I don't want
to lose him.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.689
I am sending
Agent Rountree

11:26.793 --> 11:28.310
to assist Agent Blye.

11:28.413 --> 11:29.724
On my way, Kensi.

11:50.068 --> 11:52.000
Callen's car
still hasn't moved.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.310
You're gonna get
your agent killed.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.689
Kensi, move in.

11:54.793 --> 11:56.068
Let's see what the hell
Callen's up to.

11:56.172 --> 11:57.172
On it.

12:03.758 --> 12:05.068
Hello, Grisha.

12:10.103 --> 12:12.827
This is the conversation
you wanted to have?

12:12.931 --> 12:14.413
At gunpoint?

12:14.517 --> 12:17.758
When I trained you, I taught you
the language of violence.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.724
And I can assure you
I'm still fluent.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.827
Toss me your gun.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.689
I need you to understand
what I'm about to tell you.

12:34.793 --> 12:38.034
And having this seems to be the
only way to get you to listen.

12:38.137 --> 12:39.896
You're not wrong about that.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.793
Drive the van.

12:41.896 --> 12:43.965
I'll tell you where to go.

12:47.655 --> 12:49.896
[sighs][engine starts]

12:50.000 --> 12:51.724
Camarillo Airport
gave us access

12:51.827 --> 12:53.724
to their security footage.

12:55.310 --> 12:56.310
That's Beltran.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.103
Do you know who
these other people are?

12:59.206 --> 13:02.206
No, but I'm gonna find out.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.586
Send them to me,
and I'll forward them to Langley

13:04.689 --> 13:05.689
for facial rec.I can just

13:05.793 --> 13:06.965
run those here.Send them to me.

13:11.344 --> 13:13.413
Sending now.

13:22.517 --> 13:23.793
[door closes]

13:29.793 --> 13:31.275
[sighs]

13:32.344 --> 13:34.655
Callen's not here,
and he's changed clothes.

13:34.758 --> 13:37.344
He said there was an empty van
outside, but it's gone now.

13:37.448 --> 13:38.827
Agent Namazi,
let's find that van.

13:38.931 --> 13:41.137
You've lost him completely.

13:52.137 --> 13:53.724
FATIMA:
Kaleidoscope found Callen's van.

13:53.827 --> 13:56.862
I tracked him to Van Nuys,
then to the 101, to the 405,

13:56.965 --> 13:58.655
past LAX.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.862
Your agent is being hunted
by highly trained killers.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.034
Kaleidoscope is a tenuous
connection at best.

14:04.137 --> 14:06.275
Pray you don't lose him.[cell phone buzzes]

14:06.379 --> 14:08.103
Go.

14:09.344 --> 14:11.379
CIA may have identified

14:11.482 --> 14:13.206
the three operatives
with Beltran.

14:16.862 --> 14:18.620
[sighs]

14:27.275 --> 14:28.655
You could've killed me.

14:28.758 --> 14:30.689
You didn't.

14:30.793 --> 14:31.793
So what are we doing?

14:31.896 --> 14:33.551
I'm trying to talk to you.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.275
I'm trying to understand
how you feel.

14:36.379 --> 14:39.137
No, no.
We're not doing that.

14:39.241 --> 14:41.310
You are not my therapist.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.896
You just tell me

14:43.000 --> 14:44.482
exactly what
you want.

14:44.586 --> 14:46.896
I want to save your life.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.482
I want to save Leah's life.

14:49.586 --> 14:51.724
And, hopefully,
my own in the process.

14:51.827 --> 14:53.517
Well, let me be really clear--

14:53.620 --> 14:56.758
I don't give a damn
about your life.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.206
Full stop.

15:00.620 --> 15:01.758
Turn right.

15:02.586 --> 15:06.275
There's an underground garage
on the left, turn into it.

15:13.862 --> 15:15.103
I got another hit
on Callen's van

15:15.206 --> 15:17.137
crossing 6th
and Harbor.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.931
That's San Pedro,
by the water.

15:20.034 --> 15:21.620
Yeah, if Pembrook's
looking to kill him,

15:21.724 --> 15:23.379
there are a lot better places
to do that.

15:23.482 --> 15:24.931
Well, let's just hope
he's not looking

15:25.034 --> 15:26.448
for a place to torture him.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.724
You do realize
that's what Pembrook does.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.206
He's a sadist.

15:30.310 --> 15:32.862
[cell phone buzzes]Yes, I am well aware of that.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.448
Langley identified the two men
and one woman with Beltran

15:35.551 --> 15:37.793
at the airfield.
You should have it.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.793
The Agency says
they believe

15:39.896 --> 15:42.931
they are Russian operatives
or Russian military contractors.

15:43.034 --> 15:44.551
But they don't seem
to be FSB.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.931
We had hits a few months ago
when they entered the country,

15:47.034 --> 15:50.620
but we don't have any intel
on why they entered the U.S.

16:04.655 --> 16:05.655
Now what?

16:05.758 --> 16:07.793
You are obsessive

16:07.896 --> 16:09.206
and consumed with anger.

16:09.310 --> 16:12.206
This isn't about me.Do you deny it?

16:12.310 --> 16:15.482
Decades of searching for answers
about your past,

16:15.586 --> 16:18.482
that only led to
more questions.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.965
Your anger drives
your obsession.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.793
You're not working
through your past,

16:22.896 --> 16:25.620
you're banging your head
into it, over and over.

16:25.724 --> 16:26.931
What do you want?

16:27.034 --> 16:28.620
Understand,
in no uncertain terms,

16:28.724 --> 16:31.275
I did horrible things.

16:31.379 --> 16:33.931
I'll never deny that.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.000
We were children.
Yes.

16:37.103 --> 16:38.689
Making it that
much worse.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.137
At the time, I thought...

16:43.241 --> 16:46.586
my training methods
were justified

16:46.689 --> 16:49.482
for the greater good
of the children and, uh,

16:49.586 --> 16:51.862
society, but...

16:51.965 --> 16:53.793
it's been clear for decades that

16:53.896 --> 16:56.137
I couldn't have been more wrong.

16:57.103 --> 17:00.793
And I am consumed with remorse
every day of my life.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.275
I don't care.

17:02.379 --> 17:04.103
I'm not
asking you to.

17:05.517 --> 17:07.619
My only solace is that
you fought through

17:07.723 --> 17:09.862
much of your
early childhood trauma.

17:09.964 --> 17:13.172
Stop talking about me.

17:14.378 --> 17:16.137
You don't know me.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.448
Actually, I do, Grisha.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.723
I know everything about you.

17:25.792 --> 17:28.758
I've been watching you
for 35 years.

17:31.206 --> 17:33.517
Thank you.
Uh, transferring you now.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.862
That was NCIS
Director Vance's assistant.

17:36.965 --> 17:38.034
They want you to hop on

17:38.137 --> 17:39.068
a conference call
in three minutes.

17:39.172 --> 17:41.689
I'll send it
to your office.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.724
Perfect timing. Excuse me.

17:47.206 --> 17:49.965
Actually, I've kept tabs on all
the children who went through

17:50.068 --> 17:51.793
Drona.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.827
Tried to help the ones
who suffered the most.

17:53.931 --> 17:55.275
Why don't I buy this?

17:55.379 --> 17:58.034
If we get out of this alive,

17:58.137 --> 18:01.068
as proof of
my benevolent motives,

18:01.172 --> 18:03.068
I will...

18:03.172 --> 18:05.000
get you your paper file.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.965
In it is everything known
about Grisha Callen since

18:09.068 --> 18:12.068
long before your mother's death
to the present day.

18:12.172 --> 18:14.137
All my notes are in there.

18:14.241 --> 18:15.620
[sighs]

18:15.724 --> 18:17.931
It's authentic.
It's handwritten.

18:18.034 --> 18:19.379
You can date-testthe ink.

18:19.482 --> 18:20.724
In it, I talk about

18:20.827 --> 18:22.689
my fear of doing harm.

18:23.965 --> 18:26.310
I talk about my own childhood.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.551
I, too, was denied emotion.

18:30.655 --> 18:32.862
I don't care
about your childhood,

18:32.965 --> 18:34.206
but I want that file.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.034
I know you do.
You should've had it

18:36.137 --> 18:38.344
long ago. I'm sorry.

18:40.241 --> 18:42.275
So that's what this
is all about?

18:43.448 --> 18:45.517
Some sort of apology?

18:45.620 --> 18:47.206
[sighs]

18:47.310 --> 18:50.793
My whole life since Drona
has been an apology.

18:54.862 --> 18:58.827
Understand,
it has taken me years

18:58.931 --> 19:01.241
to trust any relationship.

19:03.827 --> 19:05.517
I have gone from

19:05.620 --> 19:07.172
jobs at DEA,

19:07.275 --> 19:11.000
CIA, NCIS,
all to distract me from...

19:11.103 --> 19:13.275
having to face what you did.

19:16.034 --> 19:19.793
You broke in me

19:19.896 --> 19:21.413
the most

19:21.517 --> 19:24.586
elemental aspect of being human.

19:24.689 --> 19:27.172
I tried to kill
your ability to feel.

19:27.275 --> 19:29.310
I know.

19:29.413 --> 19:32.586
It was a terrible thing to do.

19:33.689 --> 19:36.827
It was a terrible
thing to do.

19:36.931 --> 19:38.413
I'm sorry.

19:39.758 --> 19:43.172
Well, just so you know,
I don't accept your apology.

19:47.034 --> 19:48.827
Of course.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.689
[phone line rings]

19:52.793 --> 19:55.344
Where the hell is that call
from Director Vance?

19:59.517 --> 20:01.620
KILBRIDE [over comms]:
Agent Namazi?

20:03.103 --> 20:04.931
[laptop beeps]

20:32.586 --> 20:34.689
Because we haven't gotten
any other hits on the van,

20:34.793 --> 20:36.172
I believe it could've stopped

20:36.275 --> 20:37.793
somewhere near its
last known location.

20:38.724 --> 20:41.413
Pembrook worked closely
with our agency.

20:41.517 --> 20:43.068
He might be using
a CIA safe site.

20:43.172 --> 20:44.310
That makes sense.

20:44.413 --> 20:45.827
Officer Cortes,

20:45.931 --> 20:48.344
may I speak to you
in my office?

20:49.689 --> 20:51.793
Of course.Agent Namazi will direct you.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.103
Did you talk to Director Vance
about this situation?No.

20:58.206 --> 21:00.379
Come on in. Close the door.

21:04.793 --> 21:05.931
Have a seat.

21:06.034 --> 21:07.206
Do you really think
this is a time

21:07.310 --> 21:08.344
for sitting?

21:08.448 --> 21:09.344
I think there's always time

21:09.448 --> 21:10.862
for two men to sit down,

21:10.965 --> 21:12.965
look each other in the eye,
and have a conversation.

21:13.068 --> 21:14.551
Sit.

21:17.724 --> 21:20.344
Especially when
there has been...

21:20.448 --> 21:22.241
dishonesty.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.586
Dishonesty?

21:25.689 --> 21:27.965
I have one of my agents in
the crosshairs of an assassin,

21:28.068 --> 21:29.931
so I'm gonna need
some straight answers.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.517
I'm an officer of
the Central Intelligence Agency.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.586
Straight answers might be
hard to come by.

21:34.689 --> 21:36.758
Well, I'm an aggravated
old son of a bitch

21:36.862 --> 21:39.034
who knows how to shake the life
out of a tree

21:39.137 --> 21:40.724
until it drops its fruit.

21:42.103 --> 21:43.586
Are you threatening me?

21:43.689 --> 21:46.689
We also did facial rec,
and they came back as Americans.

21:46.793 --> 21:49.068
I'm sure they were backstopped.

21:49.172 --> 21:51.172
One of them went to USC.

21:51.275 --> 21:53.068
He played football there.

21:53.172 --> 21:54.931
Now, I know
Coach Robinson.

21:55.034 --> 21:57.413
I texted him directly.

21:57.517 --> 22:01.137
He remembers the guy.
He was not backstopped.

22:01.241 --> 22:03.206
Okay,

22:03.310 --> 22:04.827
so they're U.S. citizens.

22:04.931 --> 22:07.172
And you are not leaving
my office until you tell me

22:07.275 --> 22:10.586
everything you know
about Pembrook and Beltran.

22:10.689 --> 22:12.896
And you're gonna stop me?

22:14.344 --> 22:16.000
With force?

22:18.137 --> 22:20.517
Don't tease me.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.689
Hey, Fatima,
Rountree just got here.

22:24.793 --> 22:27.034
FATIMA [over comms]:
Because we haven't gotten
another hit on the van,

22:27.137 --> 22:29.965
the thought is it's parked
somewhere in the area,

22:30.068 --> 22:32.448
so just hang tight there.KENSI: All right, got it.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.448
Anything else
on the Russians?

22:34.551 --> 22:35.724
Yeah, I don't think
they're Russian.

22:35.827 --> 22:37.965
The CIA isn't telling us
the whole truth.

22:38.068 --> 22:40.275
Kilbride's going mano a mano
with Cortes right now.

22:40.379 --> 22:42.172
KENSI:
All right, keep us posted.

22:42.275 --> 22:43.689
Will do.

22:43.793 --> 22:45.103
If you care so much
about these Drona subjects,

22:45.206 --> 22:46.448
why do you keep killing them?

22:46.551 --> 22:48.862
And finally we get
to the present day.

22:50.275 --> 22:52.448
I've been running
a team of former

22:52.551 --> 22:53.896
Drona subjects for years.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.275
We were running
black operations...

22:56.379 --> 22:57.482
Tell me something I don't know.

22:57.586 --> 22:59.793
Beltran was part of my team.

22:59.896 --> 23:02.586
He and several
other operatives

23:02.689 --> 23:04.103

She was trying to turn
children into super agents.

39:02.068 --> 39:04.034
That wasn't her intention.
She put you into the program

39:04.137 --> 39:07.137
because you were brilliant
and you were gifted,

39:07.241 --> 39:10.413
and she wanted you
to fulfill your potential.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.482
Her version of my potential.

39:12.586 --> 39:14.310
She couldn't teach
you the violin.

39:15.275 --> 39:17.448
That world was all she knew,
it's all she had to offer you.

39:17.551 --> 39:19.103
It's a mistake
parents often make.

39:19.206 --> 39:21.620
She's not my parents.

39:21.724 --> 39:24.103
You're missing
the most important part.

39:25.310 --> 39:27.689
Call her what you will...

39:27.793 --> 39:29.862
you mean everything to her.

39:32.655 --> 39:34.793
And you always have.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.758
What are you saying?

39:40.862 --> 39:42.241
You were as
close to a son

39:42.344 --> 39:44.655
as she's ever had.

39:49.448 --> 39:51.379
How do you know that?

39:52.241 --> 39:53.862
Because she told me.

40:00.137 --> 40:02.172
Even Henrietta Lange needs
someone to talk to

40:02.275 --> 40:03.931
once in a while.

40:06.689 --> 40:07.896
Now, I know
you think

40:08.000 --> 40:09.448
you have been
alone in this world

40:09.551 --> 40:11.000
all this time,

40:11.103 --> 40:12.689
but you have been...

40:13.931 --> 40:15.931
...you've been far
from an orphan.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.137
You've been loved deeply.

40:23.965 --> 40:25.482
So...

40:25.586 --> 40:27.724
Anyway, here's your, uh...

40:28.758 --> 40:30.413
...here's your file.

40:30.517 --> 40:32.310
It's everything.

40:32.413 --> 40:34.965
Grandparents,
birth, siblings,

40:35.068 --> 40:37.172
adolescence.

40:37.275 --> 40:38.724
Your life.

40:44.068 --> 40:46.827
If you don't mind
taking some advice...

40:47.965 --> 40:52.827
...don't make your life
be just about the past.

40:53.793 --> 40:56.379
Let it be about
the present and...

40:57.310 --> 40:58.689
...and now, the future.

41:01.448 --> 41:06.206
By the way, con... gratulations
on your engagement.

41:09.172 --> 41:11.862
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.

41:13.655 --> 41:15.931
I really do.

41:19.551 --> 41:21.655
Yeah.

41:27.241 --> 41:28.448
Oh,

41:28.551 --> 41:30.379
take a look
in that file.

41:30.482 --> 41:31.379
You'll see

41:31.482 --> 41:32.758
who gave Hetty the dossier

41:32.862 --> 41:36.206
on Senior Chief Petty
Officer Sam Hanna.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.034
You?

41:41.137 --> 41:44.000
I thought he'd make
a great partner.

41:44.103 --> 41:45.586
No, that's not true.

41:47.379 --> 41:50.034
I thought
he'd make a great friend.
