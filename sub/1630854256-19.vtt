WEBVTT

00:15.068 --> 00:16.413
You shouldn't have done
any of this.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.379
Am I Subject 17?

00:18.482 --> 00:19.689
Yes.

00:21.344 --> 00:22.827
I need to find
Pembrook.

00:22.931 --> 00:25.689
CALLEN [over phone]:
Leah, your life is in danger.

00:26.517 --> 00:28.413
14.

00:28.517 --> 00:29.517
I'd like to stay
with Leah.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.103
This is still an active threat.

00:31.206 --> 00:32.931
We both want the same thing,

00:33.034 --> 00:34.206
to kill Pembrook.

00:34.310 --> 00:37.275
He is still a monster, 17.

00:47.862 --> 00:50.172
The doctors give any prognosis?

00:50.275 --> 00:52.965
No. They're saying she's showing
signs of consciousness,

00:53.068 --> 00:55.000
and now we just
have to wait.

00:55.103 --> 00:59.000
The facility they recommended
specializes in rehabilitation,

00:59.103 --> 01:01.172
so that's
a good sign.

01:01.275 --> 01:03.344
We're ready to roll.

01:04.793 --> 01:07.758
Elevators and hallways secure?OFFICER [over comms]: Yes, sir.

01:07.862 --> 01:09.241
All right,
let's move, quickly.

01:15.310 --> 01:17.482
Anything else
I can do?

01:17.586 --> 01:20.551
Ah, nobody will know
the location of the facility.

01:20.655 --> 01:23.137
She's being checked in
under an alias

01:23.241 --> 01:25.103
and no visitors.

01:25.206 --> 01:27.103
We'll keep her safe.All right.

01:28.103 --> 01:30.137
Let me know
how she's doing.
Will do.

01:30.241 --> 01:32.723
[grunts][engine starts]

01:43.378 --> 01:45.000
I didn't want
to say anything back there,

01:45.103 --> 01:46.586
but they just found
Clayton's body.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.723
Geez, if they can
get to Clayton,

01:50.827 --> 01:51.758
they can get
to anybody.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.344
We need a plan.

01:53.448 --> 01:56.517
Everybody wants
to meet, now.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.241
Set it up.

02:09.310 --> 02:11.206
Hang tight back there.
We'll be five minutes.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.689
NURSE: Sure.Let's go.

02:19.551 --> 02:20.862
They found Clayton.

02:20.965 --> 02:22.275
Yeah, I heard.

02:22.379 --> 02:23.931
His wrists were zip-tied.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.689
Eyes burnt out with cigarettes.

02:27.344 --> 02:29.310
They wanted him to
give the rest of us up.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.517
None of us are safe.

â™ª â™ª

03:17.275 --> 03:18.931
What do we got?

03:19.034 --> 03:20.793
Whoa, that's not a good look.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.827
Trust me, it's only gonna
get worse as the day goes on.

03:23.931 --> 03:26.310
Looks like somebody skipped
their 15 minutes of mindfulness.

03:26.413 --> 03:28.862
Four people, including

03:28.965 --> 03:30.862
a CIA officernamed

03:30.965 --> 03:33.034
Avery Lamica, were shot dead

03:33.137 --> 03:36.241
40 minutes ago in the middle
of Pershing Square.

03:36.344 --> 03:37.275
Wait, that's where
you sent Kensi?

03:37.379 --> 03:38.862
Yes, and Callen

03:38.965 --> 03:40.275
was with Lamica just before

03:40.379 --> 03:41.896
she was shot.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.482
Callen said he was gonna be
with Leah Novak.

03:43.586 --> 03:45.310
Lamica was part of Novak's

03:45.413 --> 03:47.344
CIA protection detail.

03:47.448 --> 03:49.793
So we think this has something
to do with Drona?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.103
It would appear that way.

03:51.206 --> 03:52.413
What else did the CIA say?

03:52.517 --> 03:53.793
We're about to find out.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.137
Morning, gentlemen. This is

03:57.241 --> 03:59.137
CIA Officer
Rafael Cortes.

03:59.241 --> 04:00.379
Admiral Kilbride.

04:00.482 --> 04:03.137
This is
Investigator Deeks,

04:03.241 --> 04:04.379
Special Agent
Rountree.

04:04.482 --> 04:05.827
Where are Agents
Callen and Hanna?

04:05.931 --> 04:08.172
Hanna is taking
a personal day out of town

04:08.275 --> 04:09.310
and won't be
joining us.

04:09.413 --> 04:10.517
And Callen?

04:10.620 --> 04:12.000
Callen is en route
to the crime scene.

04:12.103 --> 04:13.793
I don't want Callen
running point on this.

04:13.896 --> 04:15.862
Well, that's not a decision
for you to make.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.067
You asked for our help
on this and...

04:18.172 --> 04:20.310
We asked for information.

04:20.413 --> 04:22.137
CIA doesn't need your help.

04:22.241 --> 04:24.275
FBI is handling
the shooting.

04:24.379 --> 04:26.034
Callen let Anthony Beltran
get away.

04:26.137 --> 04:28.862
Beltran knew as much about
Howard Pembrook as anybody.

04:28.965 --> 04:30.448
Call Callen
back to OSP

04:30.551 --> 04:32.034
so I can question him.

04:32.137 --> 04:33.896
I have a feeling that
he wouldn't come back

04:34.000 --> 04:36.137
even if I did order him,

04:36.241 --> 04:38.310
which I am not
going to do.

04:38.413 --> 04:40.620
Look, Leah Novak was obviously
transported via ambulance.

04:40.724 --> 04:42.620
Does CIA have intelligence on
where that ambulance is now?

04:42.724 --> 04:44.448
No.
ROUNTREE:
Who else was a part

04:44.551 --> 04:46.344
of the protection detail,
besides Lamica?

04:46.448 --> 04:48.206
CIA Officer Chris Behr,

04:48.310 --> 04:49.551
but we haven't been able
to locate him.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.275
Do we know why
Lamica was in the park?

04:51.379 --> 04:54.000
My guess is she was meeting
with other Drona team members.

04:54.103 --> 04:55.620
Why?

04:55.724 --> 04:58.137
Howard Pembrook ran
black ops for DoD,

04:58.241 --> 04:59.448
NSA...

04:59.551 --> 05:00.965
And CIA.
CORTES: Yes.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.827
That was, until they all
started killing each other.

05:02.931 --> 05:05.379
Anthony Beltran said
it was because they were filing

05:05.482 --> 05:06.689
a civil suit against Pembrook

05:06.793 --> 05:08.241
for what he did to them
as children.

05:08.344 --> 05:10.310
As far as I'm concerned,
they're all ticking time bombs.

05:10.413 --> 05:12.344
Pembrook
made monsters,

05:12.448 --> 05:14.655
including Agent Callen.

05:14.758 --> 05:17.448
[sirens wailing,
indistinct radio chatter]

05:17.551 --> 05:19.689
[sighs]
So, that's Lamica.

05:19.793 --> 05:21.310
She was just
at the hospital.

05:21.413 --> 05:23.000
What about the
other CIA officer?

05:23.103 --> 05:25.344
Behr.
He's not here. Hey,

05:25.448 --> 05:27.517
LAPD get anything
from the witnesses?KENSI: No. Nothing yet.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.965
So Lamica goes
down first.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.000
The rest of them try and
get away in this direction.

05:32.103 --> 05:34.137
Well, other than Lamica,
they were all shot from behind

05:34.241 --> 05:35.689
as they ran.

05:36.965 --> 05:38.172
We're gonna have to
go through every one

05:38.275 --> 05:39.379
of those office buildings
to try and find

05:39.482 --> 05:40.482
the sniper's
location.

05:40.586 --> 05:41.827
Yeah, and judging by the angle,

05:41.931 --> 05:43.448
it was probably
one of the top floors.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.103
I'll look at the victims again.
I'll do the math.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.172
I'll narrow it down.Fatima,

05:47.275 --> 05:49.689
see there's any traffic
or security cam footage

05:49.793 --> 05:51.379
from South Olive around
the time of the shooting.

05:51.482 --> 05:52.689
Looking for an ambulance.

05:52.793 --> 05:54.482
FATIMA [over comms]:
Yeah. Checking.

05:54.586 --> 05:57.448
Agent Callen, there is
a CIA Officer Cortes here

05:57.551 --> 05:59.724
who would very much
like to speak to you.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.034
Well, we have a few of them
here right now.

06:01.137 --> 06:02.655
CORTES [over comms];
Agent Callen,

06:02.758 --> 06:03.931
I need to talk to you.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.827
FBI can handle
this investigation.

06:05.931 --> 06:07.965
Well, they're not even
on the scene yet.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.206
Callen,
they think Lamica was there

06:09.310 --> 06:10.379
meeting with Drona subjects.

06:10.482 --> 06:12.551
Behr and Lamica could be Drona.

06:12.655 --> 06:13.827
Which would explain why

06:13.931 --> 06:15.275
they were put on
the protection detail.

06:15.379 --> 06:17.000
There has to be several of them
in the Agency.

06:17.103 --> 06:18.344
CORTES:
Including you, Agent Callen.

06:18.448 --> 06:19.931
You were in the CIA.

06:20.034 --> 06:21.862
You were also a Drona subject.CALLEN: You know what?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.896
Y-You're breaking up. I'm
gonna have to get back to you,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.172
all right?

06:25.275 --> 06:26.379
Looking at the entry

06:26.482 --> 06:28.103
and exit wounds
on Lamica's body,

06:28.206 --> 06:30.379
there is no way that those
gunshots came from the building.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.517
It is too steep.

06:32.620 --> 06:33.862
So where was
the shooter?

06:33.965 --> 06:35.551
I mean, all I can think of
is a helicopter.

06:35.655 --> 06:37.862
They'd be one hell
of a marksman.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.275
All right, according to civilian
air traffic control, there were

06:44.379 --> 06:47.241
eight helicopters in the
vicinity at 8:16 this morning.

06:47.344 --> 06:50.724
We're looking at something due
northeast at about 1,400 feet.

06:51.586 --> 06:52.448
This one.KILBRIDE: Who owns it?

06:52.551 --> 06:53.793
Let's see.

06:54.793 --> 06:57.931
Tail number is
November-0418.

06:58.034 --> 07:00.137
It's owned by
a corporation called

07:00.241 --> 07:02.000
Cypress Park
Industries.

07:02.103 --> 07:03.517
There should be
a point of origin.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.103
Camarillo Airport.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.655
Somebody must've seen
who got on that helo.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.551
Deeks...Yeah, I'm about to find out.

07:09.655 --> 07:11.172
Last chance, Agent Callen,

07:11.275 --> 07:13.206
or I'll have the FBI escort you
from the crime scene.

07:13.310 --> 07:15.000
Everything I know about
Pembrook and Beltran

07:15.103 --> 07:16.551
is in my report.

07:16.655 --> 07:17.655
Besides, we're already done
here. I'm headed back in.

07:26.068 --> 07:27.896
Guys, give us a sec.

07:30.068 --> 07:31.172
Who is this?

07:31.275 --> 07:32.172
PEMBROOK [over phone]:
We need to talk.

07:34.827 --> 07:36.793
PEMBROOK:
Don't feel.

07:36.896 --> 07:38.206
Remember?

07:38.310 --> 07:41.862
Feelings cause pain.

07:45.310 --> 07:46.724
There's nothing I'd like more.

07:46.827 --> 07:49.448
It's a conversation that's been

07:49.551 --> 07:51.482
a long, long time coming.

07:53.793 --> 07:56.000
I've waited
my whole life for it.

08:04.103 --> 08:05.344
PEMBROOK [over phone]:
You're at the bottom

08:05.448 --> 08:06.379
of a deep, dark ocean,

08:06.482 --> 08:08.275
Grisha, and you have no idea

08:08.379 --> 08:10.068
which way is up.

08:13.310 --> 08:15.689
Hey, Fatima, trace the call
coming into Callen's phone now.

08:15.793 --> 08:17.068
And you're gonna show me
the light, huh?

08:17.172 --> 08:18.827
I understand your anger.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.655
You cannot begin
to understand it.

08:20.758 --> 08:22.034
So what do you want to do?

08:22.137 --> 08:23.758
You want to hurt me?
You want to kill me?

08:23.862 --> 08:25.793
I think I choose both.

08:28.896 --> 08:30.965
Then let me give you
the opportunity.

08:31.068 --> 08:34.172
But you have to listen to
my instructions very carefully.

08:34.275 --> 08:36.688
No other agents.

08:36.793 --> 08:38.344
This is between you and me.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.827
Why would I
agree to that?

08:41.206 --> 08:43.688
Because we both know
you'd do anything

08:43.793 --> 08:46.137
to face the monster
of your childhood.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.931
I think you give yourself
a little too much credit.

08:49.034 --> 08:51.172
There's a water bottle
under a bench

08:51.275 --> 08:53.689
on the south corner
of Pershing Square.

08:55.344 --> 08:57.000
You'll find an address on it.

08:57.793 --> 08:58.724
What's going on?

08:58.827 --> 09:00.655
Pembrook's here.
What?

09:00.758 --> 09:03.965
South corner of the
park by a coffee cart.

09:13.103 --> 09:15.448
Fatima, do you have anything
on Pembrook's phone?

09:15.551 --> 09:16.862
I lost the signal.[phone buzzes]

09:16.965 --> 09:19.206
The FBI is now on scene.

09:22.241 --> 09:24.793
Kens, you're not gonna
find him. He's gone.

09:24.896 --> 09:27.000
He left me an address.

09:30.586 --> 09:31.862

FBI.

Go, go.

09:39.551 --> 09:41.517
I'll stay close.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.206
Yeah, we'll get it to you.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.068
I don't know if you guys
are overhearing this, but

09:45.172 --> 09:47.034
the aviation tech
just confirmed Beltran

09:47.137 --> 09:49.275
and three other people
were on that helo,

09:49.379 --> 09:50.827
but no Pembrook.Copy that.

As soon as you get that footage,
I want it sent to Langley

Well, of course.

in the driveway.

on the bottle.

of the pool.

Can you fish it out?

10:37.068 --> 10:39.758
He's got cameras
all over the place.

10:39.862 --> 10:41.827
I think he's watching me.

10:43.689 --> 10:45.551
He wants me to go in the water

10:45.655 --> 10:47.482
so I short out
any tracking devices.

10:47.586 --> 10:49.068
Do not go offline,

10:49.172 --> 10:50.758
Agent Callen.

10:50.862 --> 10:52.413
KENSI:
Callen, I know what you want.

10:52.517 --> 10:56.068
Do not let Pembrook manipulate
you into doing something stupid.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.379
[beeping]

11:15.482 --> 11:16.965
We've lost Callen's comms.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.827
You have no control
over your agents.

11:20.758 --> 11:22.379
We can still track him
via his car.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.620
I'll stay close.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.655
I don't want
to lose him.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.689
I am sending
Agent Rountree

11:26.793 --> 11:28.310
to assist Agent Blye.

11:28.413 --> 11:29.724
On my way, Kensi.

11:50.068 --> 11:52.000
Callen's car
still hasn't moved.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.310
You're gonna get
your agent killed.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.689
Kensi, move in.

11:54.793 --> 11:56.068
Let's see what the hell
Callen's up to.

11:56.172 --> 11:57.172
On it.

12:03.758 --> 12:05.068
Hello, Grisha.

12:10.103 --> 12:12.827
This is the conversation
you wanted to have?

12:12.931 --> 12:14.413
At gunpoint?

12:14.517 --> 12:17.758
When I trained you, I taught you
the language of violence.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.724
And I can assure you
I'm still fluent.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.827
Toss me your gun.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.689
I need you to understand
what I'm about to tell you.

12:34.793 --> 12:38.034
And having this seems to be the
only way to get you to listen.

12:38.137 --> 12:39.896
You're not wrong about that.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.793
Drive the van.

12:41.896 --> 12:43.965
I'll tell you where to go.

12:47.655 --> 12:49.896
[sighs][engine starts]

12:50.000 --> 12:51.724
Camarillo Airport
gave us access

12:51.827 --> 12:53.724
to their security footage.

12:55.310 --> 12:56.310
That's Beltran.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.103
Do you know who
these other people are?

12:59.206 --> 13:02.206
No, but I'm gonna find out.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.586
Send them to me,
and I'll forward them to Langley

13:04.689 --> 13:05.689
for facial rec.I can just

13:05.793 --> 13:06.965
run those here.Send them to me.

13:11.344 --> 13:13.413
Sending now.

13:22.517 --> 13:23.793
[door closes]

13:29.793 --> 13:31.275
[sighs]

13:32.344 --> 13:34.655
Callen's not here,
and he's changed clothes.

13:34.758 --> 13:37.344
He said there was an empty van
outside, but it's gone now.

13:37.448 --> 13:38.827
Agent Namazi,
let's find that van.

13:38.931 --> 13:41.137
You've lost him completely.

13:52.137 --> 13:53.724
FATIMA:
Kaleidoscope found Callen's van.

13:53.827 --> 13:56.862
I tracked him to Van Nuys,
then to the 101, to the 405,

13:56.965 --> 13:58.655
past LAX.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.862
Your agent is being hunted
by highly trained killers.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.034
Kaleidoscope is a tenuous
connection at best.

14:04.137 --> 14:06.275
Pray you don't lose him.[cell phone buzzes]

14:06.379 --> 14:08.103
Go.

14:09.344 --> 14:11.379
CIA may have identified

14:11.482 --> 14:13.206
the three operatives
with Beltran.

14:16.862 --> 14:18.620
[sighs]

14:27.275 --> 14:28.655
You could've killed me.

14:28.758 --> 14:30.689
You didn't.

14:30.793 --> 14:31.793
So what are we doing?

14:31.896 --> 14:33.551
I'm trying to talk to you.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.275
I'm trying to understand
how you feel.

14:36.379 --> 14:39.137
No, no.
We're not doing that.

14:39.241 --> 14:41.310
You are not my therapist.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.896
You just tell me

14:43.000 --> 14:44.482
exactly what
you want.

14:44.586 --> 14:46.896
I want to save your life.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.482
I want to save Leah's life.

14:49.586 --> 14:51.724
And, hopefully,
my own in the process.

14:51.827 --> 14:53.517
Well, let me be really clear--

14:53.620 --> 14:56.758
I don't give a damn
about your life.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.206
Full stop.

15:00.620 --> 15:01.758
Turn right.

15:02.586 --> 15:06.275
There's an underground garage
on the left, turn into it.

15:13.862 --> 15:15.103
I got another hit
on Callen's van

15:15.206 --> 15:17.137
crossing 6th
and Harbor.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.931
That's San Pedro,
by the water.

15:20.034 --> 15:21.620
Yeah, if Pembrook's
looking to kill him,

15:21.724 --> 15:23.379
there are a lot better places
to do that.

15:23.482 --> 15:24.931
Well, let's just hope
he's not looking

15:25.034 --> 15:26.448
for a place to torture him.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.724
You do realize
that's what Pembrook does.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.206
He's a sadist.

15:30.310 --> 15:32.862
[cell phone buzzes]Yes, I am well aware of that.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.448
Langley identified the two men
and one woman with Beltran

15:35.551 --> 15:37.793
at the airfield.
You should have it.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.793
The Agency says
they believe

15:39.896 --> 15:42.931
they are Russian operatives
or Russian military contractors.

15:43.034 --> 15:44.551
But they don't seem
to be FSB.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.931
We had hits a few months ago
when they entered the country,

15:47.034 --> 15:50.620
but we don't have any intel
on why they entered the U.S.

16:04.655 --> 16:05.655
Now what?

16:05.758 --> 16:07.793
You are obsessive

16:07.896 --> 16:09.206
and consumed with anger.

16:09.310 --> 16:12.206
This isn't about me.Do you deny it?

16:12.310 --> 16:15.482
Decades of searching for answers
about your past,

16:15.586 --> 16:18.482
that only led to
more questions.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.965
Your anger drives
your obsession.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.793
You're not working
through your past,

16:22.896 --> 16:25.620
you're banging your head
into it, over and over.

16:25.724 --> 16:26.931
What do you want?

16:27.034 --> 16:28.620
Understand,
in no uncertain terms,

16:28.724 --> 16:31.275
I did horrible things.

16:31.379 --> 16:33.931
I'll never deny that.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.000
We were children.
Yes.

16:37.103 --> 16:38.689
Making it that
much worse.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.137
At the time, I thought...

16:43.241 --> 16:46.586
my training methods
were justified

16:46.689 --> 16:49.482
for the greater good
of the children and, uh,

16:49.586 --> 16:51.862
society, but...

16:51.965 --> 16:53.793
it's been clear for decades that

16:53.896 --> 16:56.137
I couldn't have been more wrong.

16:57.103 --> 17:00.793
And I am consumed with remorse
every day of my life.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.275
I don't care.

17:02.379 --> 17:04.103
I'm not
asking you to.

17:05.517 --> 17:07.619
My only solace is that
you fought through

17:07.723 --> 17:09.862
much of your
early childhood trauma.

17:09.964 --> 17:13.172
Stop talking about me.

17:14.378 --> 17:16.137
You don't know me.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.448
Actually, I do, Grisha.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.723
I know everything about you.

17:25.792 --> 17:28.758
I've been watching you
for 35 years.

17:31.206 --> 17:33.517
Thank you.
Uh, transferring you now.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.862
That was NCIS
Director Vance's assistant.

17:36.965 --> 17:38.034
They want you to hop on

17:38.137 --> 17:39.068
a conference call
in three minutes.

17:39.172 --> 17:41.689
I'll send it
to your office.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.724
Perfect timing. Excuse me.

17:47.206 --> 17:49.965
Actually, I've kept tabs on all
the children who went through

17:50.068 --> 17:51.793
Drona.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.827
Tried to help the ones
who suffered the most.

17:53.931 --> 17:55.275
Why don't I buy this?

17:55.379 --> 17:58.034
If we get out of this alive,

17:58.137 --> 18:01.068
as proof of
my benevolent motives,

18:01.172 --> 18:03.068
I will...

18:03.172 --> 18:05.000
get you your paper file.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.965
In it is everything known
about Grisha Callen since

18:09.068 --> 18:12.068
long before your mother's death
to the present day.

18:12.172 --> 18:14.137
All my notes are in there.

18:14.241 --> 18:15.620
[sighs]

18:15.724 --> 18:17.931
It's authentic.
It's handwritten.

18:18.034 --> 18:19.379
You can date-testthe ink.

18:19.482 --> 18:20.724
In it, I talk about

18:20.827 --> 18:22.689
my fear of doing harm.

18:23.965 --> 18:26.310
I talk about my own childhood.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.551
I, too, was denied emotion.

18:30.655 --> 18:32.862
I don't care
about your childhood,

18:32.965 --> 18:34.206
but I want that file.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.034
I know you do.
You should've had it

18:36.137 --> 18:38.344
long ago. I'm sorry.

18:40.241 --> 18:42.275
So that's what this
is all about?

18:43.448 --> 18:45.517
Some sort of apology?

18:45.620 --> 18:47.206
[sighs]

18:47.310 --> 18:50.793
My whole life since Drona
has been an apology.

18:54.862 --> 18:58.827
Understand,
it has taken me years

18:58.931 --> 19:01.241
to trust any relationship.

19:03.827 --> 19:05.517
I have gone from

19:05.620 --> 19:07.172
jobs at DEA,

19:07.275 --> 19:11.000
CIA, NCIS,
all to distract me from...

19:11.103 --> 19:13.275
having to face what you did.

19:16.034 --> 19:19.793
You broke in me

19:19.896 --> 19:21.413
the most

19:21.517 --> 19:24.586
elemental aspect of being human.

19:24.689 --> 19:27.172
I tried to kill
your ability to feel.

19:27.275 --> 19:29.310
I know.

19:29.413 --> 19:32.586
It was a terrible thing to do.

19:33.689 --> 19:36.827
It was a terrible
thing to do.

19:36.931 --> 19:38.413
I'm sorry.

19:39.758 --> 19:43.172
Well, just so you know,
I don't accept your apology.

19:47.034 --> 19:48.827
Of course.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.689
[phone line rings]

19:52.793 --> 19:55.344
Where the hell is that call
from Director Vance?

19:59.517 --> 20:01.620
KILBRIDE [over comms]:
Agent Namazi?

20:03.103 --> 20:04.931
[laptop beeps]

20:32.586 --> 20:34.689
Because we haven't gotten
any other hits on the van,

20:34.793 --> 20:36.172
I believe it could've stopped

20:36.275 --> 20:37.793
somewhere near its
last known location.

20:38.724 --> 20:41.413
Pembrook worked closely
with our agency.

20:41.517 --> 20:43.068
He might be using
a CIA safe site.

20:43.172 --> 20:44.310
That makes sense.

20:44.413 --> 20:45.827
Officer Cortes,

20:45.931 --> 20:48.344
may I speak to you
in my office?

20:49.689 --> 20:51.793
Of course.Agent Namazi will direct you.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.103
Did you talk to Director Vance
about this situation?No.

20:58.206 --> 21:00.379
Come on in. Close the door.

21:04.793 --> 21:05.931
Have a seat.

21:06.034 --> 21:07.206
Do you really think
this is a time

21:07.310 --> 21:08.344
for sitting?

21:08.448 --> 21:09.344
I think there's always time

21:09.448 --> 21:10.862
for two men to sit down,

21:10.965 --> 21:12.965
look each other in the eye,
and have a conversation.

21:13.068 --> 21:14.551
Sit.

21:17.724 --> 21:20.344
Especially when
there has been...

21:20.448 --> 21:22.241
dishonesty.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.586
Dishonesty?

21:25.689 --> 21:27.965
I have one of my agents in
the crosshairs of an assassin,

21:28.068 --> 21:29.931
so I'm gonna need
some straight answers.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.517
I'm an officer of
the Central Intelligence Agency.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.586
Straight answers might be
hard to come by.

21:34.689 --> 21:36.758
Well, I'm an aggravated
old son of a bitch

21:36.862 --> 21:39.034
who knows how to shake the life
out of a tree

21:39.137 --> 21:40.724
until it drops its fruit.

21:42.103 --> 21:43.586
Are you threatening me?

21:43.689 --> 21:46.689
We also did facial rec,
and they came back as Americans.

21:46.793 --> 21:49.068
I'm sure they were backstopped.

21:49.172 --> 21:51.172
One of them went to USC.

21:51.275 --> 21:53.068
He played football there.

21:53.172 --> 21:54.931
Now, I know
Coach Robinson.

21:55.034 --> 21:57.413
I texted him directly.

21:57.517 --> 22:01.137
He remembers the guy.
He was not backstopped.

22:01.241 --> 22:03.206
Okay,

22:03.310 --> 22:04.827
so they're U.S. citizens.

22:04.931 --> 22:07.172
And you are not leaving
my office until you tell me

22:07.275 --> 22:10.586
everything you know
about Pembrook and Beltran.

22:10.689 --> 22:12.896
And you're gonna stop me?

22:14.344 --> 22:16.000
With force?

22:18.137 --> 22:20.517
Don't tease me.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.689
Hey, Fatima,
Rountree just got here.

22:24.793 --> 22:27.034
FATIMA [over comms]:
Because we haven't gotten
another hit on the van,

22:27.137 --> 22:29.965
the thought is it's parked
somewhere in the area,

22:30.068 --> 22:32.448
so just hang tight there.KENSI: All right, got it.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.448
Anything else
on the Russians?

22:34.551 --> 22:35.724
Yeah, I don't think
they're Russian.

22:35.827 --> 22:37.965
The CIA isn't telling us
the whole truth.

22:38.068 --> 22:40.275
Kilbride's going mano a mano
with Cortes right now.

22:40.379 --> 22:42.172
KENSI:
All right, keep us posted.

22:42.275 --> 22:43.689
Will do.

22:43.793 --> 22:45.103
If you care so much
about these Drona subjects,

22:45.206 --> 22:46.448
why do you keep killing them?

22:46.551 --> 22:48.862
And finally we get
to the present day.

22:50.275 --> 22:52.448
I've been running
a team of former

22:52.551 --> 22:53.896
Drona subjects for years.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.275
We were running
black operations...

22:56.379 --> 22:57.482
Tell me something I don't know.

22:57.586 --> 22:59.793
Beltran was part of my team.

22:59.896 --> 23:02.586
He and several
other operatives

23:02.689 --> 23:04.103
decided to do

23:04.206 --> 23:06.724
missions for hire.You tried to stop them?

23:06.827 --> 23:09.931
The only way to stop them
was to kill them.

23:10.034 --> 23:11.827
You have to understand,
in Ethiopia,

23:11.931 --> 23:15.241
in an effort to change
the course of an election,

23:15.344 --> 23:16.793
Beltran andhis team

23:16.896 --> 23:19.724
murdered a democratic
candidate for hire,

23:19.827 --> 23:21.551
along with his entire family.

23:21.655 --> 23:24.931
They killed this man's children

23:25.034 --> 23:26.551
for a paycheck.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.827
That's why Beltran and his men
are after you and your team.

23:28.931 --> 23:30.413
Yes.

23:30.517 --> 23:32.655
Drona produced men and women

23:32.758 --> 23:35.586
who are psychopathic
killing machines.

23:35.689 --> 23:36.689
You did that.

23:36.793 --> 23:38.862
And now they've turned on me.

23:40.310 --> 23:42.068
And you, Grisha.

23:44.310 --> 23:46.068
[gunshots][yells]

23:48.655 --> 23:50.172
Give me my gun.

23:50.275 --> 23:52.241
Give me my gun!

23:52.344 --> 23:54.655
[gunfire continues]

23:56.137 --> 23:57.137
We got to move.

23:57.241 --> 23:58.896
There's a stairwell over there.

24:07.724 --> 24:09.103
I'll cover you.

24:09.206 --> 24:11.413
Go to the door and
you cover me. On three.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.551
One. Two. Three.

24:13.655 --> 24:15.448
[gunshots continue]

24:34.103 --> 24:35.655
Ah!

24:38.068 --> 24:39.724
Move! Move!

24:48.620 --> 24:51.172
[coughing]You all right?

24:55.103 --> 24:56.448
Let's go.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.931
[exhales]

25:12.103 --> 25:13.137
Do you have a phone?

25:13.241 --> 25:16.103
I... I ditched
the burner at the park.

25:16.206 --> 25:18.482
I'm also
out of ammo.

25:18.586 --> 25:20.000
We got to
keep moving.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.620
Let's go.

25:28.310 --> 25:29.931
Come on.

25:39.655 --> 25:41.137
[door opens]

25:45.586 --> 25:46.793
Come on, come on.

25:47.586 --> 25:48.793
BELTRAN:
Clear the cubicles.

26:01.724 --> 26:03.034
CALLEN [quietly]:
Let's go.

26:14.620 --> 26:16.620
WOMAN:
Next floor.

26:39.103 --> 26:41.551
You can begin
by sharing all your files

26:41.655 --> 26:43.310
on Pembrook's black ops.

26:43.413 --> 26:44.827
That's not gonna happen.

26:44.931 --> 26:47.379
You can have the CIA's
full cooperation, Admiral,

26:47.482 --> 26:49.655
without everything we do
being fully transparent.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.758
CORTES [over comms]:
You can't expect us
to expose operations

26:51.862 --> 26:53.827
that are irrelevant
to this investigation.

26:53.931 --> 26:55.758
FATIMA [over comms]:
Cortes also worked with

26:55.862 --> 26:57.965
the same black ops
team as Beltran.

26:58.068 --> 27:00.793
[phone buzzes]Okay, the Agency is sending me

27:00.896 --> 27:02.655
a list of CIA safe locations

27:02.758 --> 27:04.241
near the last hit
on Callen's van.

27:04.344 --> 27:07.827
If Beltran and Cortes worked
with the same people...

27:07.931 --> 27:10.758
Then we must assume
the transitive property.

27:10.862 --> 27:13.689
If A equals B

27:13.793 --> 27:16.689
and B equals C,
then A must equal C.

27:16.793 --> 27:18.793
Cortes is working with Beltran.

27:18.896 --> 27:20.068
Excuse me?

27:20.172 --> 27:22.724
I'm sorry,
I'm just doing the math.

27:22.827 --> 27:24.482
What would that math be?

27:24.586 --> 27:26.137
That would
be geometry,

27:26.241 --> 27:28.448
Officer Cortes.
More specifically,

27:28.551 --> 27:30.103
geometric proofs.

27:36.379 --> 27:37.793
[door closes]

27:39.172 --> 27:40.206
Wait.

27:41.448 --> 27:42.448
This is
a server room.

27:42.551 --> 27:45.103
It's soundproof,
it's flameproof.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.931
Steel door,
bolts from the inside.

27:48.034 --> 27:48.931
This would
buy us some time.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.137
It'd also trap us.

27:50.241 --> 27:51.896
Not you. Me.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.689
I can't run anymore.
I'm bleeding.

27:56.172 --> 27:57.896
Go, Grisha.

28:00.103 --> 28:02.034
There's only one more floor.

28:03.758 --> 28:04.965
Running out of real estate.

28:10.448 --> 28:11.517
Okay.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.206
Let's do it.

28:26.517 --> 28:28.034
Let's clear it.

28:32.137 --> 28:33.758
You and Anthony Beltran
worked with

28:33.862 --> 28:35.241
the same
black ops team.

28:35.344 --> 28:36.862
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.413
Yes, you do.

28:39.206 --> 28:40.931
I need you to explain to me

28:41.034 --> 28:43.379
precisely what your role
in all this is.

28:43.482 --> 28:45.206
My role?

28:46.517 --> 28:48.862
[laughs]

29:00.931 --> 29:02.206
Hey, over here!

29:11.758 --> 29:12.862
It's a steel door.

29:12.965 --> 29:13.965
See if there's
anything around here

29:14.068 --> 29:15.620
that we can use to get it open.

29:15.724 --> 29:16.655
CORTES:
This is stupid.

29:16.758 --> 29:18.413
It's been nice working with you.

29:18.517 --> 29:20.448
Sit down. You'll never
make it to the door.

29:23.551 --> 29:24.689
Yes, I will.

29:24.793 --> 29:26.448
Are you insane?

29:28.448 --> 29:29.862
[sighs]

29:29.965 --> 29:32.172
My life is over as I know it.

29:33.965 --> 29:36.241
You're Drona.

29:36.344 --> 29:38.241
You're part of

29:38.344 --> 29:41.620
Pembrook's team,
and you're working with Beltran.

29:41.724 --> 29:46.551
Now you understand
the desperation of my situation,

29:46.655 --> 29:50.103
and the lengths I'll go to
to get out of this building.

29:54.068 --> 29:56.862
We have a situation.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.034
Admiral, I wanted...

30:02.931 --> 30:05.275
You're going to need
to move right now.

30:05.379 --> 30:06.620
The Admiral and I are leaving.

30:06.724 --> 30:08.448
No, you're not.

30:09.482 --> 30:12.137
I'll ask once more. Move.

30:13.862 --> 30:16.172
Just listen to him,
Agent Namazi.

30:16.275 --> 30:18.931
Sir, I believe he needs
to listen to me.

30:22.758 --> 30:23.724
Officer Cortes,

30:23.827 --> 30:25.413
please take a look around you.

30:27.620 --> 30:30.172
Go ahead.

30:43.206 --> 30:45.448
All I want to do
is leave this office.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.275
You really want me
to shoot him over that?

30:48.379 --> 30:50.241
Or you?

30:52.724 --> 30:54.379
Stand up.

30:58.137 --> 31:00.379
The next one,
I put into her face.

31:01.413 --> 31:02.896
Stand up.

31:18.034 --> 31:20.068
Tell them
to lower their weapons.

31:20.172 --> 31:22.620
Lower your weapons.

31:27.931 --> 31:29.620
Walk to me.

31:32.310 --> 31:33.310
Come on.

31:35.931 --> 31:37.413
It's that way.

31:42.793 --> 31:44.448
Now move away
from the door.

31:44.551 --> 31:45.931
Which way?

31:46.034 --> 31:47.310
To the left.

31:47.413 --> 31:49.689
To the left,
like the BeyoncÃ© song?Move.

31:49.793 --> 31:52.000
Okay, my left or your left?

31:52.103 --> 31:53.413
To that left.

32:06.482 --> 32:08.034
[grunting]

32:08.137 --> 32:09.551
[yells]

32:20.896 --> 32:22.551
[whirring]

32:33.206 --> 32:35.310
We got to find
another way out of here.

32:46.551 --> 32:47.586
[metal clanks]

32:47.689 --> 32:49.275
Stop.

32:56.586 --> 32:57.965
Keep going.

33:06.758 --> 33:08.068
It's too small.

33:08.172 --> 33:09.344
[breathing heavily]

33:09.448 --> 33:11.310
That's not
gonna work.

33:18.137 --> 33:19.586
We're in.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.068
Cortes has been
sending all our info

33:22.172 --> 33:23.241
about Callen's location

33:23.344 --> 33:24.448
to someone
this entire time.

33:24.551 --> 33:26.172
I would imagine that is Beltran.

33:26.275 --> 33:28.344
Do you have the number?Yeah.

33:28.448 --> 33:31.068
We're gonna need to find the
location of that phone, quickly.

33:36.827 --> 33:38.172
It's an empty
office building,

33:38.275 --> 33:40.310
one block from
the last hit on Callen's van.

33:40.413 --> 33:43.103
It's probably a CIA safe site.

33:43.206 --> 33:44.655
That's how Beltran found them.

33:44.758 --> 33:46.000
Rountree, Kensi?

33:46.103 --> 33:47.103
Go.FATIMA: I'm sending you

33:47.206 --> 33:48.206
an address for Callen.

33:48.310 --> 33:49.586
It's one block east of you,

33:49.689 --> 33:51.137
but proceed with caution.

33:51.241 --> 33:52.655
We believe Beltran's
in there as well.

33:52.758 --> 33:54.413
We can't wait for Deeks.
We're moving.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.103
[drill whirring]

33:58.206 --> 33:59.586
It's close.

34:00.620 --> 34:02.931
Grisha, wait.

34:03.034 --> 34:04.379
When Henrietta

34:04.482 --> 34:06.275
found out what
I was doing,

34:06.379 --> 34:08.965
she pulled you from
the program immediately.

34:09.068 --> 34:10.827
Blame me for everything.

34:10.931 --> 34:12.516
Not Hetty.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.310
ROUNTREE:
See the smoke?

34:21.413 --> 34:23.344
Where there's smoke...

34:27.172 --> 34:28.172
[drill whirring]

34:28.275 --> 34:29.655
Why didn't she tell me?

34:35.931 --> 34:37.551
[coughing]Rountree, anything?

34:37.655 --> 34:39.241
No bodies.

34:42.620 --> 34:44.103
I got blood.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.344
KENSI:
Come on.

34:47.931 --> 34:49.724
[grunts]

34:51.620 --> 34:53.034
Got it.

34:53.137 --> 34:54.757
Hey.

34:55.965 --> 34:58.620
I got nothing.All right, next floor.

35:03.931 --> 35:05.379
Hey, guys.

35:13.758 --> 35:14.620
Where's Callen?

35:14.724 --> 35:17.344
I don't know, we split up.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.896
Keep searching for him.

35:20.172 --> 35:21.896
Mm. [inhales through nose]

35:22.000 --> 35:24.379
Everyone always thought
you were evil.

35:24.482 --> 35:26.206
[coughs]
Some kind
of monster.

35:26.310 --> 35:28.482
[chuckles]

35:28.586 --> 35:30.344
[chuckles]

35:30.448 --> 35:32.379
But I knew different.

35:33.413 --> 35:35.724
That's gonna be your downfall.

35:35.827 --> 35:38.275
I wish that were true.

35:39.931 --> 35:42.137
Because you know what?

35:43.103 --> 35:45.137
Living with what I've done

35:45.241 --> 35:48.137
is much harder than dying.

35:48.241 --> 35:50.310
Well, then...

35:52.620 --> 35:54.068
....let me put you
out of your misery.

35:54.172 --> 35:55.413
[inhales]

35:58.241 --> 35:59.310
[grunts]

35:59.413 --> 36:01.137
ROUNTREE:
Federal agents!

36:01.241 --> 36:02.724
KENSI:
Federal agents!

36:02.827 --> 36:03.827
On the ground, now.

36:03.931 --> 36:06.137
Down.
Get down. Down.

36:06.241 --> 36:07.965
You okay?

36:09.620 --> 36:11.862
He needs an
ambulance.

36:11.965 --> 36:13.275
Quickly.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.275
Fatima, we need
an ambulance now.

36:15.379 --> 36:17.310
[sirens wailing in distance]

36:22.448 --> 36:24.724
Okay, thank you.

36:26.172 --> 36:28.275
Leah and Officer Behr are safe.

36:28.379 --> 36:29.862
Good.

36:29.965 --> 36:33.137
NCIS agents are going
to escort you to the hospital.

36:33.241 --> 36:34.758
After you recover,

36:34.862 --> 36:36.448
you're gonna be held
for questioning.

36:37.275 --> 36:40.275
I want everything you've done
with Drona on record.

36:40.379 --> 36:42.551
It's not going to happen
that way, Grisha.

36:54.862 --> 36:57.172
Agent Callen.

36:57.275 --> 36:58.965
These are
agents from both

36:59.068 --> 37:00.827
DoD intelligence
and NSA.

37:00.931 --> 37:04.344
We're taking Howard Pembrook
into our custody.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.344
Do you know what he's done?

37:07.448 --> 37:08.344
Very much so.

37:08.448 --> 37:10.827
I'm also from the program.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.724
There are a lot of us.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.068
He made us.

37:18.172 --> 37:21.275
For worse and for better.

37:25.862 --> 37:26.655
Hold on.

37:26.758 --> 37:28.931
Walk away,
Agent Callen.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.448
Why didn't Hetty
say anything?

37:34.551 --> 37:35.827
Why didn't Hetty tell me

37:35.931 --> 37:37.379
I was taken...

37:49.448 --> 37:51.655
â™ª â™ª

38:09.241 --> 38:10.482
[sighs]

38:10.586 --> 38:12.482
[phone buzzes]

38:16.241 --> 38:17.586
Who is this?

38:17.689 --> 38:19.827
PEMBROOK:
I can't make up
for what I did...

38:21.241 --> 38:23.482
...but I can take away
the pain of not knowing.

38:23.586 --> 38:25.241
Meet me outside.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.965
[call beeps off]

38:34.965 --> 38:36.896
Hello, Grisha.

38:38.103 --> 38:40.000
Um, I didn't want
to leave like that,

38:40.103 --> 38:42.379
but it-it wasn't the place.

38:42.482 --> 38:44.551
So answer me now.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.172
If Hetty pulled me
out of the program,

38:46.275 --> 38:47.620
why didn't she
ever tell me that?

38:47.724 --> 38:49.551
It's not something
you'd ever see in her,

38:49.655 --> 38:51.896
but Hetty was
consumed with guilt

38:52.000 --> 38:53.965
for putting you in
the program in the first place.

38:54.068 --> 38:56.344
Well, her guilt doesn't
make up for it, okay?

38:56.448 --> 38:57.793
I was used.

38:57.896 --> 39:01.965
She was trying to turn
children into super agents.

39:02.068 --> 39:04.034
That wasn't her intention.
She put you into the program

39:04.137 --> 39:07.137
because you were brilliant
and you were gifted,

39:07.241 --> 39:10.413
and she wanted you
to fulfill your potential.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.482
Her version of my potential.

39:12.586 --> 39:14.310
She couldn't teach
you the violin.

39:15.275 --> 39:17.448
That world was all she knew,
it's all she had to offer you.

39:17.551 --> 39:19.103
It's a mistake
parents often make.

39:19.206 --> 39:21.620
She's not my parents.

39:21.724 --> 39:24.103
You're missing
the most important part.

39:25.310 --> 39:27.689
Call her what you will...

39:27.793 --> 39:29.862
you mean everything to her.

39:32.655 --> 39:34.793
And you always have.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.758
What are you saying?

39:40.862 --> 39:42.241
You were as
close to a son

39:42.344 --> 39:44.655
as she's ever had.

39:49.448 --> 39:51.379
How do you know that?

39:52.241 --> 39:53.862
Because she told me.

40:00.137 --> 40:02.172
Even Henrietta Lange needs
someone to talk to

40:02.275 --> 40:03.931
once in a while.

40:06.689 --> 40:07.896
Now, I know
you think

40:08.000 --> 40:09.448
you have been
alone in this world

40:09.551 --> 40:11.000
all this time,

40:11.103 --> 40:12.689
but you have been...

40:13.931 --> 40:15.931
...you've been far
from an orphan.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.137
You've been loved deeply.

40:23.965 --> 40:25.482
So...

40:25.586 --> 40:27.724
Anyway, here's your, uh...

40:28.758 --> 40:30.413
...here's your file.

40:30.517 --> 40:32.310
It's everything.

40:32.413 --> 40:34.965
Grandparents,
birth, siblings,

40:35.068 --> 40:37.172
adolescence.

40:37.275 --> 40:38.724
Your life.

40:44.068 --> 40:46.827
If you don't mind
taking some advice...

40:47.965 --> 40:52.827
...don't make your life
be just about the past.

40:53.793 --> 40:56.379
Let it be about
the present and...

40:57.310 --> 40:58.689
...and now, the future.

41:01.448 --> 41:06.206
By the way, con... gratulations
on your engagement.

41:09.172 --> 41:11.862
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.

41:13.655 --> 41:15.931
I really do.

41:19.551 --> 41:21.655
Yeah.

41:27.241 --> 41:28.448
Oh,

41:28.551 --> 41:30.379
take a look
in that file.

41:30.482 --> 41:31.379
You'll see

41:31.482 --> 41:32.758
who gave Hetty the dossier

41:32.862 --> 41:36.206
on Senior Chief Petty
Officer Sam Hanna.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.034
You?

41:41.137 --> 41:44.000
I thought he'd make
a great partner.

41:44.103 --> 41:45.586
No, that's not true.

41:47.379 --> 41:50.034
I thought
he'd make a great friend.

41:52.758 --> 41:54.448
â™ª I need the call... â™ª

41:54.551 --> 41:57.000
Despite everything, I, uh...

41:58.655 --> 42:00.793
...I tried to look out for you.

42:02.344 --> 42:03.551
I...

42:04.724 --> 42:07.034
I tried to make up for it all.

42:07.137 --> 42:09.931
â™ª Home â™ª

42:10.862 --> 42:15.620
â™ª I wanna go home â™ª

42:19.172 --> 42:24.551
â™ª It's why I'm going on home â™ª

42:25.482 --> 42:30.000
â™ª I'm going home â™ª

42:30.862 --> 42:33.620
â™ª I'm following the lead â™ª

42:33.724 --> 42:36.344
â™ª Of the setting sun â™ª

42:36.448 --> 42:39.241
â™ª And I'm going back â™ª

42:39.344 --> 42:42.620
â™ª Where I came from. â™ª
