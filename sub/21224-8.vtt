They might be the only kids
that know their way around.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.096
I know.
All the wives and I

11:36.129 --> 11:37.798
were talking yesterday,
and they were like,

11:37.831 --> 11:39.199
"I don't know how
to get anywhere."

11:39.232 --> 11:40.834
I'm like, "Don't worry,
it took me a full year."

11:40.868 --> 11:41.935
I want to hold
my tennis racket.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.370
Okay. All right.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
Hamm: Two weeks ago,
John Fassel and his family

11:45.438 --> 11:46.473
were in football limbo.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.908
All right.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.143
The hiring of
Sean McVay signaled

11:50.177 --> 11:54.147
the end of Fassel's tenure
as the Rams' interim head coach.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.415
Daddy, I want to
hold your hand!

11:55.448 --> 11:57.317
Come on, babe.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.086
But the Fassel family
is staying put.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.521
Put this down right here.
This will be home plate.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.024
Come on. See where
it says "number one"?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.425
That's first base.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.494
Lila and Avery's dad
will return to coach

12:07.527 --> 12:11.398
the Rams' special teams
for a sixth season.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.100
-Oh, yeah!
-[ Laughs ]

12:13.133 --> 12:14.902
Ready?

12:14.935 --> 12:18.071
Armed with a fresh outlook
from his time as head coach.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.539
Oh, yeah.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.374
Fassel:
I always thought I had

12:21.408 --> 12:23.410
the ultimate appreciation
for the position.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.245
Nine.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.849
Now that I had the opportunity
for three weeks to do that,

12:28.882 --> 12:31.151
it's a little bit
different perspective now

12:31.184 --> 12:33.854
being back to, you know,
position coach and coordinator.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.023
It's a totally different world.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.925
-Oh, geez!
-Oh!

12:37.958 --> 12:41.094
Daddy almost lost an arm
on that one.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.530
Once we found out that
Coach McVay was gonna keep us,

12:43.563 --> 12:45.532
we decided basically that day

12:45.565 --> 12:47.801
that we were gonna move
from where we lived

12:47.835 --> 12:50.137
down by the airport up
here to Thousand Oaks.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.372
So, I was sleeping
in the office, you know,

12:52.405 --> 12:54.541
a couple nights a week
and missed a lot

12:54.574 --> 12:57.477
during the season
with all three girls.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.981
Now it's the off-season,
and being a couple miles away,

13:01.014 --> 13:02.950
it's been great.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.284
But, you know, the longer
we can stick out

13:04.317 --> 13:06.820
at one place, the better.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.321
You know, especially
when you feel like you have

13:08.355 --> 13:11.391
a great group of players
and a place you like to live

13:11.424 --> 13:13.026
and a place you like
to work for.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.862
You know, you'd like to stay
because every time

13:14.895 --> 13:16.864
you move it resets the counter
back to one and you're like,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.331
"Well, I don't know
if we're gonna be here

13:18.365 --> 13:21.201
for one or for two or for five."

13:21.234 --> 13:23.403
So, to hang in in one place
as long as you can

13:23.436 --> 13:27.174
is pretty lucky.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.442
When you're done,
you can put a huge heart

13:29.476 --> 13:30.844
around all your stars.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.179
Yeah.
Okay.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.481
Hamm: Fassel is one of
the lucky ones.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.583
Uh-oh! [ Laughs ]
What's that?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.051
I wanted to do that.
What was that?

13:38.085 --> 13:39.352
He won't be uprooting
his family

13:39.386 --> 13:41.889
and moving to another city.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.590
You guys get a couple gunning
reps and just flip-flop.

13:43.623 --> 13:47.194
He, along with running backs
coach Skip Peete

13:47.227 --> 13:50.363
and assistant offensive line
coach Andy Dickerson,

13:50.397 --> 13:52.265
are the only three
assistant coaches

13:52.299 --> 13:54.601
being kept on McVay's staff.

13:54.634 --> 13:58.438
The other 20, fired.

13:58.471 --> 14:03.944
Forced to pack up,
move out, start over.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.520
Boras: My wife Amy and I,
we have three kids.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.023
When we headed out
to Oxnard last year,

14:16.056 --> 14:18.225
left the family behind.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.994
After the season in Los Angeles,
got back to St. Louis

14:21.028 --> 14:23.964
for about two weeks
before getting hired here.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.400
And so, I got here probably
January 15th, January 20th,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.102
so it's been over a year now.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.471
You know, it's been
about 55 weeks.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.007
It's hard to be away, obviously.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.442
We understand
that's part of the life

14:35.475 --> 14:38.345
that you get into as a coach.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.514
But, you know, it's hard,
you know,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.417
when you don't get
to see those guys every day.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.520
Home is where
your family is, you know?

14:47.554 --> 14:50.257
And that, to me, is home.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.159
They've been out here
once house hunting,

14:52.192 --> 14:54.427
so we'll be closing June 16th,

14:54.461 --> 14:56.596
so we're excited about being
together as a family again.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.967
And then the new adventure of,
you know,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.501
of them starting school
and finding friends

15:01.534 --> 15:05.438
and living in a different
part of the world,

15:05.472 --> 15:09.709
which we're getting
pretty good at.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.645
[ Engine starts ]

15:12.679 --> 15:14.547
You know, any time
you get an opportunity

15:14.581 --> 15:16.649
to work in this league,
you want to take advantage

15:16.683 --> 15:20.687
of that opportunity
regardless what your title is.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.991
And so here in Buffalo,
you know, having been hired

15:24.024 --> 15:25.959
as the tight end coach,
you know,

15:25.993 --> 15:31.264
extremely excited about that
and do the best that I can.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.369
Your wife finding friends
and your kids, you know,

15:36.403 --> 15:40.173
hopefully finding friends
quickly and feeling comfortable,

15:40.207 --> 15:42.609
they're the ones
that didn't sign up for it.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.480
They'll get here,
and they won't have

15:47.514 --> 15:50.183
that immediate support system
like a coach does with guys

15:50.217 --> 15:53.153
that he has something
in common with.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.057
The last little over
a year has been hard

15:57.090 --> 15:59.059
just not having
the family around.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.462
So to get them, you know, so I
can get to the basketball games

16:02.495 --> 16:05.632
and the football games and just
go out to dinner with my wife

16:05.665 --> 16:09.336
and have a normal family life

16:09.369 --> 16:12.505
is something
that's real exciting.

16:14.407 --> 16:18.745
Hamm: These days,
there is no NFL off season.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.613
The work continues
in Indianapolis

16:20.647 --> 16:23.016
where coaches and executives
from every team

16:23.050 --> 16:25.352
gather for the Scouting Combine

16:25.385 --> 16:27.354
to take a look
at the top prospects

16:27.387 --> 16:31.124
for the upcoming NFL draft.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.060
Snead: Now you're
getting some guys

16:33.093 --> 16:35.628
that were really productive
football players.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.564
How do they fit?
You got to figure them out.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.199
I mean,
they're gonna play,

16:39.232 --> 16:42.535
That's what makes a draft
a draft, is you don't know.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.338
There you go,
our buddy from Ashland.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.640
280 pounds.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.309
He's going in the second.

16:49.342 --> 16:54.247
He'll go -- I think he's got to
go in the second round.

16:54.281 --> 16:58.385
The Rams are especially
interested in pass catchers.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.754
Look at this.
Big dude.

Jared Goff needs weapons,

of General Manager Les Snead.

two months away,

starting to arrive
in Los Angeles.

five veteran free agents,

including Pro Bowl left tackle,
Andrew Witworth.

closed back over.

was him in my damn face!

a great white today,

with it though, you know?

I can't say nothing negative
about the Rams, you know?

19:24.331 --> 19:28.535
being traded for a coffee mug
and a stapler,

19:28.568 --> 19:29.969
but at the end of the day, man,

19:30.002 --> 19:33.640
they gave me the opportunity
to change my life.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.609
I'll be forever grateful
for that, you know?

my high school football team,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.281
two year starter in college
in a small school.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.751
Now I got lucky enough and had
enough favor over my life

19:44.784 --> 19:46.586
to be able to play
this beautiful sport.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.522
So, for me, it's a blessing,

his most memorable play

all back around,

he is for me to be here,

but there has already
been a trade.

moving up one spot.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.997
What do you think, first blush,
that could be all about?

31:05.031 --> 31:09.668
That's got to be the --
Is that for Trubisky?

31:09.701 --> 31:12.604
I wonder if it's the QB.

With the second pick
in the 2017 NFL Draft,

31:17.977 --> 31:21.147

Mitchell Trubisky.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.182
-Whoa!
-Quarterback, North Carolina.

Eisen: Well, hello.

31:25.284 --> 31:30.256
Mitchell Trubisky
is going to Chicago.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.025

interesting.

That is amazing.

they would take him one.

the team trading up

31:51.110 --> 31:54.180
to draft their quarterback,
Jared Goff,

31:54.213 --> 31:58.317
a move which has left them with
no first round pick this year.

Yes.

You don't have
to convince me on that.

to the 37th overall pick.

a decision to make --

32:24.210 --> 32:26.245

There you go, baby.

You got to play
the probabilities,

Every time...

32:45.397 --> 32:47.766
Every time I've been here,

32:47.799 --> 32:49.568
rule number one,

32:49.601 --> 32:52.671
you don't want to
pick early second often.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.706
But when you pick
the early second,

32:54.740 --> 32:56.342

with the player.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.643
Yeah.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.046

What's that?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.015
Sure.

33:05.484 --> 33:09.355
Well, Buffalo's got
a good deal on our table.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.657
We would get
their 91st pick.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.293
So we give them
37 for 44?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.195
Yeah, and then
we get their third,

33:16.228 --> 33:17.363
but we give them 141.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.398
Yeah.
I could ask them,

33:19.431 --> 33:21.300
"Hey, will you take
our fifth, 149?"

33:21.333 --> 33:24.170

33:26.305 --> 33:31.177
Doug, let's do it.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.279
Eisen: The Bills just
traded up with the Rams

33:33.312 --> 33:35.214
by making this trade.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.283
The Rams swap their
fifth round pick for --

33:37.316 --> 33:39.485
they improved it
into a third round pick,

33:39.518 --> 33:41.320
and then dropped down to 44.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.821
And the Bills are coming up.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.757
That's what we want.
We wanted two instead of one.

33:45.791 --> 33:49.428
So, this is what
we planned, right?

33:49.461 --> 33:51.430
Hamm: After moving
down to 44,

33:51.463 --> 33:53.332
the Rams are still able
to acquire

33:53.365 --> 33:55.367
the small school tight end
they've had their eye on

in Washington.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.455
McVay had this kid,
Gerald Everett,

34:49.488 --> 34:50.556
circled the second he saw him

34:50.589 --> 34:52.124
and said,
"That's my Jordan Reed."

34:52.158 --> 34:54.160
He had him in Washington
and I can tell you,

34:54.193 --> 34:56.162
he had this kid,
Gerald Everett,

34:56.195 --> 34:58.497
ranked above some guys
who were already drafted

34:58.530 --> 34:59.898
at the tight end position
already,

34:59.931 --> 35:01.833
so he was one or two
on their list.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.435
That's why they were
able to trade down.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.137
They knew they can get
another wide receiver.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.273
But Gerald Everett out
of South Alabama was a guy

35:07.306 --> 35:08.507
they circled a few weeks back

35:08.540 --> 35:10.242
and they've been working
on ever since.

That's what we wanted, man.

they acquired from the Bills,

So he knew the board
and that he could get

Everett where he got him
and then he could wait

35:49.715 --> 35:53.319

40:48.914 --> 40:51.617
Hamm:
Win or be shown the door.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.219
Jeff Fisher knew the score
before the 2016 season

40:54.252 --> 40:57.088
ever started.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.225
Fisher: This move thing's
not an excuse.

41:00.258 --> 41:04.162
This move thing is an advantage.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.965
Hamm: If it was,
it never showed.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.703
And the fallout
from a lost season...

41:11.737 --> 41:13.104
Very excited to be here

41:13.138 --> 41:14.640
as the head coach
of the Los Angeles Rams.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.007
Hamm: ...still ripples.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.843
I love the way
you guys are communicating.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.512
Love the way
that we're competing.

41:20.546 --> 41:24.015
Hamm: Across the league,
the story's the same 00

41:24.049 --> 41:29.154
get used to change
or find another line of work.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.823
And if you stick,
you better be strong.

41:31.857 --> 41:36.762
Have faith, make a home
wherever you are.

41:36.795 --> 41:42.033
In a few years the Rams
will have a new home, a palace.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.836
Will it be Jared Goff's domain?

41:44.870 --> 41:49.007
Can Sean McVay
turn this team around?

41:49.040 --> 41:50.976
Will Todd Gurley
and Aaron Donald

41:51.009 --> 41:52.744
still lead them?

41:52.778 --> 41:54.212
Could Jeff Fisher have a say

41:54.245 --> 41:57.749
while prowling
the opposing sideline?

41:57.783 --> 42:00.018
Time will tell.

42:00.051 --> 42:03.154
There's only one thing
they all know --

42:03.188 --> 42:07.525
in the NFL,
nothing is guaranteed.
