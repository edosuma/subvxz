WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:12.012
- Oh, my gosh, Link.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.781
You got me jelly jams
from Metroburg.

00:13.881 --> 00:14.948
How did you know
I wanted these?

00:15.049 --> 00:18.219
- I kinda caught on after
your 20 texts.

00:18.319 --> 00:22.356
- [cell phone beeping]
- Twenty-one!

00:22.456 --> 00:27.461
- Ha, you're on a slow network.
Expect about 35 more of those.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.864
Now stand back--
these can get messy.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.534
[filling splooshing]
- Mm!

00:33.634 --> 00:36.870
- Oh.
- So good.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.407
- Link brought you
jelly jams?

00:39.507 --> 00:40.641
He's so cool.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.643
- Ah, I don't see it.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.612
- I also got you guys some.

00:44.712 --> 00:48.282
- Link's the best!

00:48.382 --> 00:50.418
- You are so thoughtful
and generous.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.454
- And boring and dull
and toothy.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.523
- Oh, that's right.
Max lives here, too.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.024
- Hey, don't worry.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.059
I'll just politely
ask him to leave.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.329
You're the worst.
Get out.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.863
- Gladly.
I'm taking these with me.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.233
- [powers zapping]

01:05.333 --> 01:07.535
- I did not super-stretch
the top half of my body

01:07.635 --> 01:11.305
to Metroburg just so he could
come in and steal my jams!

01:11.405 --> 01:14.742
I got run over three times!

01:14.842 --> 01:16.310
- Okay, just ignore him

01:16.410 --> 01:18.646
and we'll paint his face while
he takes his afternoon nap.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.348
- Not this time, Phoebe.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.783
[arms squeaking]
- Hey!

01:22.883 --> 01:25.153
Let go of these jams!

01:25.186 --> 01:26.920
- What is your problem?

01:27.020 --> 01:29.457
- My problem is the son
of Evil Man should be evil,

01:29.557 --> 01:32.393
not buying delicious baked
goods for goofy girls.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.528
By the way,
you're the goofy girl.

01:34.628 --> 01:38.031
Unhand the jams, nerd!
- LINK: Never!

01:38.166 --> 01:40.334
- I mean it--let go!

01:40.434 --> 01:42.536
- [heavy thud]
- Ha. Ha.

01:48.342 --> 01:52.980
I do not get what
you see in this guy.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.249
- *

01:55.349 --> 01:56.450
* What you see

01:56.550 --> 01:58.186
* Is not what you get

01:58.219 --> 02:01.322
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:01.422 --> 02:03.191
* We fit right in

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
* Bet you never guessed

02:04.692 --> 02:06.093
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:06.194 --> 02:07.595
* Just like all the rest

02:07.695 --> 02:09.430
* A picture
perfect family *

02:09.530 --> 02:11.565
* Is what we try to be

02:11.665 --> 02:12.933
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:13.033 --> 02:14.568
* The crazy things we do

02:14.668 --> 02:16.270
* This isn't
make believe *

02:16.370 --> 02:18.038
* It's our reality

02:18.206 --> 02:19.440
* Just your average family

02:19.540 --> 02:22.543
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:22.643 --> 02:26.380
* Livin' a double life

02:28.949 --> 02:30.218
- Here's your towel, honey.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.819
I can't wash these
things fast enough

02:31.919 --> 02:33.687
since you've been
going to yoga so often.

02:33.787 --> 02:37.825
- It's "broga," Barb.
Yoga for bros.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.295
I'm sorry, you bend this body,
it is gonna sweat.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.764
- [laughing]

02:43.864 --> 02:46.934
- [grunting]

02:47.034 --> 02:50.238
- Well, you have a good workout,
my little bendy bear.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.607
- You know me--
"Namaste" fit for you.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.076
- [laughing]

02:56.244 --> 02:58.246
Phoebe, what's wrong?

02:58.346 --> 03:03.884
- It's Link.
I miss him so much.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.653
- Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.556
You know, I had a feeling
it wouldn't last.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.958
- What? No. We're
still together.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.593
- [gulping water]

03:12.693 --> 03:16.364
- Every time Link comes over,
buttface Max runs him off.

03:16.464 --> 03:19.166
- Now, Phoebe, your brother's
not a buttface.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.706
- [chomping apple]

03:25.806 --> 03:27.275
What?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.277
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.144
- Already did.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.586
As great as it was painting butt
cheeks on his face cheeks,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.654
I'd rather have Link here.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.923
I just wish he and Max
didn't hate each other so much.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.759
- Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.961
- So, you're saying if I set up
a play date for Max and Link,

03:48.061 --> 03:50.798
they might like each other and
my problem would be solved?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.300
- Huh?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.034
Uh, uh, sure, I said that.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.604
- Mom, you are awesome!
Thank you so much.

03:56.704 --> 04:00.608
- Uh, Mom of the Year!

04:02.009 --> 04:05.513
- ...99, 100!
Ready or not, here I come.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.449
[zooming]

04:08.549 --> 04:12.219
- *

04:12.320 --> 04:13.687
- Found you.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.689
- Took ya long enough.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.430
- Didn't dad just
leave for yoga?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.365
Why is he sneaking back in?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.967
- What dad does
is none of our business.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.970
- BOTH: [giggling]

04:30.070 --> 04:32.840
- Come on, let's go
follow him.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.143
- HANK: [laughing]

04:37.678 --> 04:39.680
- What's he doing
in the closet?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.349
- Maybe he thinks
it's the bathroom.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.851
It happens to
the best of us.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.218
Ready?

04:45.353 --> 04:47.988
- Gotcha!

04:48.088 --> 04:50.891
That's weird.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.460
Where'd he go?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.727
- I don't know.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.096
- He's gotta be here
somewhere.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.369
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.936
Ready to go see that movie?

05:03.036 --> 05:05.138
I wouldn't mind getting outta
here before Max shows up.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.074
- Whaddup, losers?

05:07.174 --> 05:08.376
- Too late.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.478
- So, where's this giant
Bigfoot you texted me about?

05:10.578 --> 05:12.780
'Cause all I see
is "The Missing Link."

05:12.880 --> 05:15.849
- Okay, full disclosure--
we're not going to the movies

05:15.949 --> 05:19.920
and Bigfoot doesn't exist,
you big dummy.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.589
I was hoping the guy I like

05:21.689 --> 05:23.256
and the brother I am
forced to put up with

05:23.391 --> 05:26.760
could play a game of basketball
and maybe try to get along.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.397
- I guess, if it means
this much to you,

05:29.497 --> 05:31.399
I'm willing to try.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.401
- Phoebe...

05:33.501 --> 05:35.969
I am not willing to try.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.640
But I am willing to kick this
loser's butt at basketball.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.009
- Ha. Not gonna happen, dude.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.777
- Oh, yeah?

05:43.877 --> 05:46.414
- [arm squeaking]

05:46.447 --> 05:49.583
- Whoa, you play dirty.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.052
I like it.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.722
- And that is how you start
a beautiful friendship.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.890
- [filling splooshing]

06:00.260 --> 06:02.029
- I don't get it.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.997
It's not like a grown
man can disappear.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.835
- Not unless he's Invisiman,
Dr. Vanish, Ghost Cowboy,

06:07.935 --> 06:11.238
Vapor Dude--
- I meant dad.

06:11.338 --> 06:15.443
- Well, he's not here,
but I do smell him.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.211
Wait, I think it's just
these stinky shoes.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.682
Whoa.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.083
We're pushing that, right?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.786
- It's too red not to push.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.623
- [gasping]

06:29.723 --> 06:31.459
A secret room.

06:31.525 --> 06:37.598
I cannot wait to see what
treasures lie inside.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.700
Ew.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.872
- Go! Go! Goal!
[laughing]

06:44.972 --> 06:48.476
- I'd laugh if it was
someone else's dad.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.177
- Oh, hey, kids.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.145
Ahhhhh!

06:52.245 --> 06:53.914
Kids, uh...

06:55.916 --> 06:57.284
Look at this room...

06:57.384 --> 07:01.855
we all just found
at the same time.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.757
- Save it, Dad.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.493
What is this place?

07:05.593 --> 07:07.027
- [sighing]
All right.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.328
I'm gonna level with you.

07:08.496 --> 07:14.067
This is my top secret
superhero surveillance room.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.836
Right now, I'm making sure

07:15.936 --> 07:20.641
everyone's safe
at this soccer game.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.843
- Dad, you're the best.

07:22.943 --> 07:27.981
I wanna be just like you.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.083
- Billy, look around.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.552
How is a buffalo
wing vending machine

07:31.652 --> 07:33.120
keeping people safe?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.055
And look at his face.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.892
He's lying.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.061
- Huh. Well, he's still
onto something

07:41.161 --> 07:44.998
with this no pants thing.

07:45.098 --> 07:49.737
- All right, fine,
it's my Thunderman Cave.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.439
When I tell your mom
I'm going to yoga,

07:52.540 --> 07:56.443
I sneak up here for
a little peace and quiet and--

07:56.544 --> 07:59.312
Come on, ref!

07:59.412 --> 08:02.983
This sanctuary has
to be our secret.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.886
We can't tell mom.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.387
- Of course.

08:07.555 --> 08:11.559
We would never tell mom about
our Thunderman Cave.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.961
- Our Thunderman Cave?

08:14.061 --> 08:18.465
- Best secret room ever!

08:18.566 --> 08:20.167
- Fore!

08:24.304 --> 08:27.641
- Whaddup, Stretch?
- Nothin' much, Cheat Breath.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.810
- This is nice--now that you and
Max are cool with each other,

08:29.910 --> 08:31.579
we've been able
to hang out here.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.213
- Yeah, he's not so bad.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.082
[laughing]
Except at basketball.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
I've been beating
him all week.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.586
- Wow, he really does like you.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.054
Usually, when someone beats him,
he frames them for a felony.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.056
- [laughing]

08:43.156 --> 08:45.458
Oh, you're serious?

08:47.094 --> 08:49.997
- We brought dinner.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.265
- Hey, Dad, can you
take us to yoga?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.101
- Didn't you go
to yoga this morning?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.003
- Yep, we also went after lunch.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.606
I'm getting awesome at darts.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.973
Pinball! Golf!

09:00.073 --> 09:03.143
Yoga stuff!

09:03.243 --> 09:06.179
- I think we've had
enough yoga for one week.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.715
Sometimes too much
of a good thing

09:07.815 --> 09:10.217
can be annoying.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.085
- Maybe Mom can take us.

09:12.185 --> 09:16.123
I bet she'd love to
see the...yoga studio.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.291
- On second thought,
I'll take you.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.094
Can't ever be too flexible.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.765
- [bones cracking]
- Ow!

09:24.865 --> 09:27.334
- Hey, Link, are you still on
for playing video games?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.036
- If you're still
on for losing.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.072
- BOTH: [laughing]

09:32.172 --> 09:33.506
- Look at you two bros.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.275
Talkin' smack,
keepin' it real,

09:35.375 --> 09:39.246
gettin' all chum-chuminay.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.182
Okay, I may have
made that last one up.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.451
- I can't believe
they actually became friends.

09:44.551 --> 09:47.287
- I know, but Link is so nice,
he can be friends with anybody.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.723
- Yeah, well, let's hope
some of his niceness

09:49.823 --> 09:52.826
rubs off on Max and not the
other way around, am I right?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.494
- [laughing]
What do you mean?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.797
- I...I was just making a joke

09:56.897 --> 09:59.767
about Max's evil ways
rubbing off on Link.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.836
- Link could never be evil.
- No, of course not.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.337
Although his father was nice

10:04.437 --> 10:07.540
before he got all buddy-buddy
with Dark Man.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.210
But Link's fine.
He's a good kid.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.846
- Yeah, a good kid.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.285
- [arm squeaking]

10:18.385 --> 10:21.789
- Whoa, you play dirty.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.091
I like it.

10:24.191 --> 10:28.128
What say I turn you evil.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.297
- Well, I am a good kid.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.232
But now that we're buddy-buddy,

10:32.332 --> 10:34.167
what are we waiting for?

10:34.267 --> 10:38.772
- BOTH: [evil laughter]

10:40.741 --> 10:43.343
- The good thing is
you can trust Link

10:43.443 --> 10:45.578
and that's the foundation of
every relationship.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.749
I mean, look at me
and your father, you know?

10:48.849 --> 10:50.718
We're all about trust.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.453
There's nothing that
he hides from me.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.923
Uh, we have no secrets,
you know,

10:56.023 --> 10:58.458
and if you're gonna have any
kind of future with Link,

10:58.558 --> 11:03.396
you have to trust that
you have no secrets.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.399
- You're right, Mom.
I trust Link.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.837
- Good.
- Max, not so much.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.809
- I took a big chance making you
my evil lieutenant, Link.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.745
You're not gonna
let me down, are you?

11:17.778 --> 11:20.647
- I'd never betray
the dark side.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.650
- Whoa, Link, in that cloak,

11:23.751 --> 11:25.886
you look exactly
like your father.

11:25.986 --> 11:29.289
He's toothy, too.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.291
- Max, sooner or later,

11:31.391 --> 11:33.260
I've gotta tell Phoebe
what we've been up to.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.862
- Dude, no.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.864
If you tell Phoebe you
joined my evil brotherhood,

11:36.964 --> 11:38.866
she's only gonna make
trouble for us.

11:38.966 --> 11:42.102
- Now come on--let's go
take down our enemies.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.374
- You're not goin' anywhere.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.077
Whoa-a-a-a!

11:50.177 --> 11:52.045
- [heavy thud]

11:54.614 --> 11:56.784
- First time on a slide?

11:56.850 --> 11:58.251
- No.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.920
Yes.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.789
- COLOSSO: [laughing]

12:07.427 --> 12:09.596
Colosso?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.366
Who froze you?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.634
- I did!

12:14.802 --> 12:17.470
- Ahh!
- [heavy thud]

12:17.570 --> 12:19.973
- That's for
turning Link evil.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.143
- There's something
seriously wrong with you.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.611
- Flower Park?

12:24.711 --> 12:26.646
What terrible things
do you have Link doing

12:26.814 --> 12:28.615
in this park after dark?

12:28.715 --> 12:31.084
- Zip it, rhymy.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.652
You don't know what
you're talking about.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.621
- Oh, really? I heard all about
your evil brotherhood

12:34.721 --> 12:37.657
and how you're gonna take down
your enemies tonight.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.627
- Okay, you kinda know
what you're talking about.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.195
- Yeah, I am not
letting you get to Link.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.430
So, if you wanna
leave this room,

12:43.530 --> 12:45.398
you've gotta go through me.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.634
- [blowing icy air]

12:49.837 --> 12:52.705
Or I can go around you.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.909
[blowing hot air]

12:56.009 --> 12:57.044
- Brrr! Brrr!

12:57.144 --> 13:00.080
Watch out, Max, Phoebe
heard everything and--

13:00.180 --> 13:02.115
Oh, never mind.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.718
- Hey, what took you so long?

13:05.853 --> 13:09.289
- I kinda ran into Phoebe.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.125
- You know what? I think it's
time I tell her what's going on.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.393
- Wait! No, you can't...

13:13.493 --> 13:15.362
because...

13:15.462 --> 13:16.663
I already told her.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.431
- You did?

13:18.531 --> 13:21.234
Was she cool with it?
- Super cool.

13:21.334 --> 13:25.272
Cold, even.
- Oh, great.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.974
Well, then, I don't feel bad
about bringing this--

13:27.074 --> 13:28.876
like you asked.
- [gasping]

13:28.942 --> 13:30.878
Evil Man's Ring of Suffering.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.412
We'll use it to subdue
our enemies--

13:32.512 --> 13:33.780
just like your dad did.

13:33.881 --> 13:37.918
Evil laugh with me
into the night.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.888
[evil laughter]
- LINK: [evil laugher]

13:40.921 --> 13:43.623
- From your gut like this.
- BOTH: [evil laughter]

13:43.723 --> 13:45.558
- It works, huh?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.895
- Pull!
- [powers zapping]

13:47.928 --> 13:50.030
- Pull!
- [powers zapping]

13:50.130 --> 13:52.199
- Enough!

13:52.299 --> 13:58.671
You two have destroyed my peace
and quiet and my man swag.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.607
Stop it or I will--

14:00.707 --> 14:03.810
- Tell mom about your
secret man cave?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.145
- I was gonna say kick
you out of here,

14:05.245 --> 14:08.916
but clearly you're
the one in charge.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.718
- Get ready, Nora.
Two at once.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.186
- [powers zapping]

14:13.286 --> 14:16.957
- [electrical sizzling]
- [metal door slams]

14:17.057 --> 14:18.758
- What's that mean, Dad?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.227
- The Hero League wanted us
to have a safe place

14:20.327 --> 14:22.229
if villains attacked,
so they designed

14:22.329 --> 14:25.065
this thundertanium-
reinforced panic room.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.001
- So we're supposed
to panic now?!

14:28.101 --> 14:32.305
- No, I'll just open the door
by typing in the code.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.241
- [electrical sizzling]

14:34.341 --> 14:36.743
- All right, Billy,
you can panic now.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.947
- Got it.
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

14:39.980 --> 14:42.415
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
There is another way out.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.852
A huge power surge outside
could open the door,

14:45.953 --> 14:48.788
and the only person
who can do that is...

14:48.956 --> 14:52.192
- ALL: Mom.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.961
- Oh.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.964
- What are you waiting for?
Call mom already.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.865
- Yeah, she'll understand why
you've been lying to her

14:58.966 --> 15:03.003
so you can eat meat
in your underwear.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.306
- Only in my dreams, Billy.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.208
New plan.
- Dad.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.642
- That door might
be made out of

15:09.742 --> 15:11.144
the strongest metal
in the world,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.845
but there is nothing
stronger than a man

15:12.980 --> 15:15.815
afraid of getting caught
by his wife!

15:15.983 --> 15:17.317
[roaring]

15:17.417 --> 15:19.352
- [heavy thud]

15:21.654 --> 15:25.158
- Give me...my phone.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.498
- Yes, Hank, I'm right outside.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.134
I don't even know what you're
doing in the panic room,

15:34.234 --> 15:38.405
but stand back, mama's about to
release the kraken.

15:38.505 --> 15:42.675
Ask the kids.
They'll know what that means.

15:42.775 --> 15:47.914
[powers zapping]

15:49.782 --> 15:52.652
- COLOSSO: Whoa! Oh! Oh!

15:52.752 --> 15:54.587
- Whoa. What just happened?

15:54.687 --> 15:57.190
- I'm guessing your mother
released the kraken.

15:59.526 --> 16:04.197
- Max froze me!
- And you froze me, ice witch!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.266
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to yell.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.869
But you have to admit
you're annoying.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.604
Admit it. Admit it!

16:11.704 --> 16:15.308
- [powers zapping]
Yes!

16:15.408 --> 16:18.811
Hank, Billy, Nora,
are you ok--

16:18.911 --> 16:22.382
What happened to the panic room?

16:22.482 --> 16:26.886
- Yeah, you two
wanna explain this?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.655
- Nice try, Hank.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.324
A putting green. Jumbo screen.
The pinball machine.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.627
This was your original plan
for our bedroom.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.364
- Okay, I turned this
place into a man cave,

16:37.464 --> 16:41.234
so I could have
some "Hank" time.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.370
- And then Billy
found out his secret

16:43.470 --> 16:47.074
and the two of them dragged me
into their world of lies.

16:47.174 --> 16:51.644
World of lies!

16:51.744 --> 16:54.281
Anybody buying this? No?

16:54.381 --> 16:59.119
- I'm sorry I lied to you, Barb.
Can you forgive me?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.088
- You know, I could look past

17:01.121 --> 17:02.622
your sneaking around
and your lies,

17:02.722 --> 17:05.125
but you know what
I can't look past?

17:05.225 --> 17:08.428
That amazing buffalo wings
vending machine!

17:08.528 --> 17:13.233
Why would you hide
this from me?

17:13.333 --> 17:16.736
- Wait, you're not mad about dad
having a secret room?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.305
- Oh, no, we have four kids,

17:18.405 --> 17:22.109
none of whom will ever find
my Fortress of Barbitude.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.711
But a buffalo wings machine.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.913
Ooh, I'll have some of those
and some of these.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.915
Oh, mango habanero!

17:37.257 --> 17:38.791
- Where are they?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.461
- MAX: We are here!

17:47.667 --> 17:50.403
Brothers!

17:50.503 --> 17:52.372
And Joni.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.906
Your Duke of Darkness

17:54.006 --> 17:57.544
commands you to chant the words
of our evil brotherhood

17:57.644 --> 18:02.515
as we prepare to take down
the keepers of the light.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.185
- OTHERS: All hail
the Duke of Darkness!

18:05.285 --> 18:08.155
For there is none more
evil or handsome.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.858
- I like that.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.428
Lieutenant, step forward.

18:15.528 --> 18:22.335
Present me
the Ring of Suffering.

18:22.435 --> 18:28.375
Yes, with the Ring of Suffering
we'll be unstoppable.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.578
- Let's get evil!

18:31.678 --> 18:33.513
- Not on my watch, you won't.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.783
- An intruder. She must be a spy
from the light side.

18:36.883 --> 18:41.321
Get her!
- Wait, no!

18:41.421 --> 18:43.556
- [thudding, crashing]

18:43.656 --> 18:45.292
- Oh, no.

18:47.827 --> 18:52.432
- Well, that was a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.234
- Phoebe, what are
you doing here?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.035
- Link, I came to
un-brainwash you.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.670
You can't be evil.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.072
You're super cute
and you bring me jelly jams.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.442
- I thought you told her.
- He didn't have to tell me.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.377
I know exactly what's
going on here.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.713
- Um, is this your
first time LARPing?

19:06.813 --> 19:12.018
Take it down a notch,
Kicki Minaj.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.254
- I'm sorry. LARPing?

19:14.354 --> 19:16.489
- It's a Live Action Role
Play game, Phoebe,

19:16.589 --> 19:18.691
and you ruined it.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.528
I'm the leader of
the Dark Realm.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.430
- Wait, I thought you
were the Duke of Darkness.

19:23.530 --> 19:27.267
- It's the same thing!

19:27.367 --> 19:28.735
For them, this is a game.

19:28.835 --> 19:32.605
But I get to be a supervillain
out in the open and I like it.

19:32.705 --> 19:37.109
- Oh, I get it.
You're a giant nerd.

19:37.244 --> 19:44.050
- No, they're the giant nerds.
I'm the guy with the ring.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.918
The Ring of Suffering!

19:46.018 --> 19:51.958
- OTHERS: You are evil
and handsome.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.060
- Brotherhood, regroup.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.563
Costume check.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.365
- Link, I am so, so sorry.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.533
I thought Max turned you
evil and I'd lost you.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.335
- Phoebe, you know
me better than that by now.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.003
- Yeah, but I also know him.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.372
- Kiss the ring.

20:05.472 --> 20:09.008
Kiss it!

20:09.108 --> 20:11.378
- I'm not gonna stop you guys,
if you wanna keep playing,

20:11.478 --> 20:13.012
and I won't keep you
from being friends.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.582
- Look, I only became friends
with Max for us.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.917
If putting up with his lies
and playing his stupid games

20:18.017 --> 20:20.320
means you and I get
to hang out,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.489
then it's worth it.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.924
- Stupid games?!

20:25.024 --> 20:30.563
From the heart of Hades,
I stab at thee!

20:30.663 --> 20:32.799
- You can't stab your
own lieutenant.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.768
- Join him!

20:35.868 --> 20:37.604
- Dude, we're on the same team.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.273
- I was done with you once
I got your dad's ring.

20:40.373 --> 20:44.744
Enjoy the afterlife!

20:44.844 --> 20:50.149
- The "afterlife" is a picnic
table with punch and cookies.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.118
- WHITE WARRIORS: [roaring]

20:52.218 --> 20:53.820
- The light side approacheth.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.923
Attack!
- [grunts of combat]

20:57.023 --> 20:58.858
- Oh, don't worry.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.827
I'll get your dad's ring back
during his next nap.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.630
- That thing?
It's my little sister's.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.898
It's actually made
out of candy.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.569
- Behold the power of the ring!

21:09.669 --> 21:11.237
- [grunts of combat]

21:11.338 --> 21:18.144
- *

21:20.780 --> 21:23.015
- Yes!
- You high scored, Billy!

21:26.453 --> 21:28.054
- MAX: [powers zapping]

21:29.989 --> 21:32.825
Looks like you missed again,
Bubble Gum Arms.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.396
- Mom, Max is bothering
me and Link.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.997
- Max, leave them alone

21:38.097 --> 21:40.232
and bring me some more
Chipotle Ranch.

21:46.205 --> 21:50.410
- I finally understand her
and dad's relationship.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.111
- Hey, where is your dad?

21:52.211 --> 21:54.113
- [clicks on TV]

21:56.383 --> 22:01.053
Finally, some peace and quiet.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.589
Oh! Oh! Oh!

22:02.689 --> 22:05.492
Yeah, touchdown!

22:05.592 --> 22:09.396
- *

22:12.131 --> 22:27.880
- *
