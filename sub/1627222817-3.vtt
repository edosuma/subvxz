00:30.720 --> 00:32.520
I brought you some coffee.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.120
Thank you.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.960
It should help. Cheers.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.760
How are you feeling?

00:39.760 --> 00:40.840
Warmer.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.600
What's the verdict?

00:43.600 --> 00:46.640
Bit of bruising to the back of the
neck, no other signs of a struggle.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.960
She was drowned, probably by someone
a lot stronger than her.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.560
She said she was meeting somebody
but she didn't say who.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.160
What about her belongings?

00:55.160 --> 00:57.760
Wallet in her jeans had a fiver
and a few cards.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.920
No phone recovered yet.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.960
She shared her location from here,
so she definitely had it on her.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.920
I'll find out what network
she was on...

01:03.920 --> 01:06.880
No. She called me from an app,
so there won't be any records.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.800
It's still worth a try, though.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.600
OK, finish up here.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.400
Let's get her across for postmortem.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.160
Quick as you can, please.
Right.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.400
This is a coordinated attack, sir.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.520
First Burke, now his girlfriend.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.080
I think we should treat
this as one investigation.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.840
I agree.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.320
There's something you need to see.

01:41.680 --> 01:45.760
Now, this is the car that picked up
Jade from the police station

01:45.760 --> 01:50.720
yesterday. I've run the plates, and
the owner is a guy called Mark Hill.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.040
Do we know him?
He works for Patrick Cruden.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.360
Jeez, Holyrood's golden boy? Aye.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.160
That's not your fault.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.120
# Do you want me on your mind

02:38.120 --> 02:43.360
# Or do you want me to go on?

02:46.280 --> 02:52.000
# I might be yours
as sure as I can say

02:53.280 --> 02:58.360
# Be gone, be far away

03:00.240 --> 03:03.440
# Ooh

03:07.640 --> 03:12.280
# Ooh

03:12.280 --> 03:16.720
# Mm. #

03:19.320 --> 03:22.600
 Control. Commence sending
sub vessel footage to CTF. Over.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.920
The diving group found the Mhairi
Finnea's hull this morning, sir.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.640
Winches, what's left of the
outrigger, and then there's this.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.920
Anechoic tiles.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.040
Ripped from the submarine's
skin on impact with the trawler.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.280
They're bagged up
and on there way back now, sir.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.560
Engineering's primed to ID
the class of boat.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.440
Let's see the Russians
talk their way out of this one.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.440
Oh, my God. What is it?

04:28.320 --> 04:32.360
You see the discolouration? There's
a substance dissolving the dye.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.600
It's the same as we found
on Burke's fleece.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.880
So what does that mean?

04:35.880 --> 04:38.920
Burke ingested some kind of toxin.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.560
That's what killed him.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.360
Adams gave him mouth-to-mouth,
and he's been unwell since.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.640
This was a pre-meditated murder.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.120
Do you think you can narrow down

04:56.120 --> 04:59.080
the substance based on Burke's
symptoms? I'm not a toxicologist.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.680
No. But you've got a degree in
medicine, which is one better than

05:01.680 --> 05:04.600
the rest of us.
Could you at least try?

05:04.600 --> 05:07.400
Yeah, of course I will. Good.
I need you to start straight away.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.960
Oh, I have a lot of other duties.
Look, I'm not trying to give you

05:09.960 --> 05:12.680
orders, but if someone's brought
poison on board, there's nothing

05:12.680 --> 05:14.560
stopping them from doing this again.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.280
Fine, I'll get on it.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.360
I need to see the captain.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.040
I'm not here to make friends.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.400
Yeah, I can see that.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.240
All right?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.960
Hardly anyone knew
they were a couple,

05:35.960 --> 05:39.680
but Jade Antoniak and Craig Burke
were murdered a few days apart.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.040
And Jade called me
at 18.45 last night,

05:44.040 --> 05:47.360
and she told me that she
was about to meet someone.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.880
She was scared.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.600
And as we know, she was
dead by the time that I got to her.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.960
The day before, however,
she had expressed suspicions -

06:00.960 --> 06:03.480
of the Navy's
involvement in Burke's death,

06:03.480 --> 06:08.440
and of infiltration within
the peace camp by MI5.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.480
Now, there's no evidence for
either of these accusations.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.480
But she was collaborating with
Craig Burke to gain access

06:15.480 --> 06:17.880
to information on Vigil.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.160
And we suspect that it's that
information that got her killed.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.360
Porter. Over to you for the USB.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.480
There's a mix of operational stuff,

06:30.480 --> 06:33.240
but there's also personal
stuff on crew.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.600
A couple of things stood out.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.200
This is drug-testing of a
hair sample.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.880
Burke paid for it at a private lab.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.840
It's positive for LSD.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.720
There's nothing to ID whose hair
he was testing, but if you look at

06:46.720 --> 06:51.400
the timing, Vigil just got back from
a mission to Port Havers in Florida.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.440
And if you look at the press
around that mission,

06:54.440 --> 06:58.320
15 crew arrested by local cops
for being drunk and disorderly

06:58.320 --> 07:00.840
and, allegedly,
high on drugs as well.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.320
What was the Navy's response?

07:02.320 --> 07:03.960
They tested the whole crew.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.120
All came back negative. No LSD.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.920
So Burke returns to the UK
and commissions this drug test?

07:09.920 --> 07:12.560
And the hair sample comes back
positive for LSD.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.640
Contradicting the Navy's results.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.200
The other thing,
in terms of Vigil's crew,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.720
is a series of photographs.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.360
I've looked through Vigil's HR files
and got a pretty solid ID on her.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.600
The woman is Lieutenant Tiffany
Docherty, ship's doctor.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.720
There's a man caught in the
background.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.040
You can't see much of him,

07:30.040 --> 07:33.000
but you can make out a tattoo
of a dragon on his upper arm.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.200
Is it Burke?

07:34.200 --> 07:35.800
Don't know, sir.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.280
OK, I want this
Lieutenant Docherty vetted

07:38.280 --> 07:40.600
and we need to look into whatever
happened in Florida.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.640
Who's the guy Burke
replaced for this patrol?

07:43.640 --> 07:45.360
The one who broke his leg?

07:45.360 --> 07:48.480
Uh, Chief Petty Officer
John Deerborne.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.200
He would've been with
the crew in Florida.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.080
I could talk to him? Good.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.320
Good, OK. Get a coded
message to DCI Silva.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.120
And let's get straight on
to Cruden's office,

07:58.120 --> 08:00.720
find out what this, uh, this adviser
has to say for himself.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.200
OK, thank you, everybody. Thank you.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.240
Boss, that's Lieutenant
Commander Branning.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.440
Answer it.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.000
Longacre.
Turn on News 24.

08:19.600 --> 08:25.280
 A sailor has been found dead on
the Royal Navy submarine HMS Vigil,

08:25.280 --> 08:28.480
one of four Vanguard-class
submarines

08:28.480 --> 08:31.680
which carries the UK's nuclear
deterrent.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.760
Did this come from your end?
Absolutely not.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.400
Burke's family maybe?

08:35.400 --> 08:38.520
We've also had questions about a
dead activist who broke onto base.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.120
That would not be us.
That is not coming from us.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.280
That's not...
I thought we had an understanding.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.600
So you very publicly arrested

08:56.600 --> 08:59.200
my XO for a murder you now
say he didn't commit?

08:59.200 --> 09:02.480
Prentice is still guilty of assault
and obstruction of justice.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.720
Walsh is guilty
of possession of drugs.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.920
What we haven't done yet is
identify Burke's killer.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.240
I specifically asked you
not to use the word

09:09.240 --> 09:10.640
"murder" in front of my crew.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.360
We've just had a reactor scram
and an enemy submarine trailing us.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.440
I needed them focused!

09:14.440 --> 09:17.560
Your second-in-command cost me two
days, trying to cover his own arse,

09:17.560 --> 09:19.920
and we're still left with
an extremely dangerous person

09:19.920 --> 09:22.720
onboard and very little evidence to
go on, so if you value the safety

09:22.720 --> 09:26.560
of your crew, I suggest you focus
on helping me and not containing me.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.000
Don't you....

09:28.000 --> 09:30.680
What? Sir, you wanted
the diagnostics on the reactor.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.960
It's all clear. No faults.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.960
So run them again.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.680
All of them?
Don't make me repeat myself.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.720
Yes, sir.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.440
So, what now?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.880
Lieutenant Docherty is
researching toxins,

09:46.880 --> 09:49.280
but there's still the question
of how someone would handle

09:49.280 --> 09:51.720
and administer the drug.
You're on a boat with 140 highly

09:51.720 --> 09:53.280
skilled engineers and technicians.

09:53.280 --> 09:57.160
If you're asking who's capable,
I have to say anybody.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.440
OK, look.

09:58.440 --> 10:02.040
We know that Burke didn't eat a meal
the last time he was in the mess.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.400
Of course, we don't know
how quick-acting the toxin was,

10:04.400 --> 10:07.000
so with my limited time...
You've got three weeks.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.240
What?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.680
Your stay with us has been extended.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.320
Orders from our superiors.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.640
I can't.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.600
I'm not prepared for that.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.080
Those are our orders.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.320
Will you excuse me?

10:32.200 --> 10:33.640
Sorry.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.760
Shit!

10:48.400 --> 10:49.680
Shit.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.120
I've got him!

11:09.360 --> 11:11.280
I want to stay with you.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.840
I know, darling,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.480
I want that too,
but it's...it's not my decision,

11:16.480 --> 11:19.880
and they're your grandparents, so...

11:22.320 --> 11:23.920
We'll still see each other.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.360
You don't love me any more.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.000
Oh, God, that is just not true.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.280
Come here.

11:34.440 --> 11:38.320
I am going to be with you
for the whole of your life.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.440
I promise.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.040
Walsh's career is over.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.080
You realise that, don't you?
Not my decision.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.120
He spent his childhood in
and out of care.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.960
You've seen the scars on his arms?
His dad used to put fags out on him.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.400
I'm sorry to hear that...
He's got zero prospects back home.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.080
You've wrecked our mate's life.
He brought drugs on to a Royal Navy

12:14.080 --> 12:16.840
submarine to frame a crew member
for possession. Those are crimes,

12:16.840 --> 12:19.720
and it's my job is to investigate.
It's not fucking personal.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.120
Burke was up to stuff as well.
Did you know that?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.480
What stuff?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.760
Look, the sooner I get answers,
the sooner I can leave

12:32.760 --> 12:35.000
you all alone. I'd say that's
win-win, wouldn't you?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.320
What can you do for Gary?

12:39.320 --> 12:40.840
We'll say he co-operated.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.160
If it goes to court, the judge will
take that into consideration.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.800
Burke had a shit-list.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.960
He told me a couple of weeks ago
he had files on all of us.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.600
So, what did you do about that?

12:57.600 --> 13:00.200
Did what you're supposed to do.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.080
I took it straight to the CO.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.160
To Newsome?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.120
Detective Silva, familygram.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.520
Three in three days. You're popular.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.880
You reckon?

13:19.880 --> 13:22.160
"Burke's girlfriend
murdered last night.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.480
"No suspect yet."

13:23.480 --> 13:26.000
Shit!
"Look into Florida.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.360
"Burke went fishing, got a big haul.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.120
"Burke had photo of doc
plus another.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.000
"Weak visual on him
but he's got my favourite book.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.960
"I hope that makes sense.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.120
"Cat's been asking after you.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.760
"She hopes you're OK.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.240
"So do I."

13:46.400 --> 13:49.920
Look, I don't deny this area
relies on Navy contracts,

13:49.920 --> 13:52.760
but consider what we could do with
the tens of billions freed up

13:52.760 --> 13:54.120
by scrapping Trident.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.400
That's money to
reinvest in this community

13:56.400 --> 13:59.320
and working communities
just like it around the country.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.560
Go ahead, Claire.

14:00.560 --> 14:06.040
Do you have any response to reports
that a sailor has died on HMS Vigil?

14:06.040 --> 14:09.000
Out of respect for a young man's
family, I'll say very little,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.320
but I will say that the Navy's
silence on this is worrying

14:12.320 --> 14:14.520
and I'll be taking it up with
the Prime Minister.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.360
Yes?

14:16.360 --> 14:17.640
You found us, then?

14:17.640 --> 14:20.080
Mr Hill! Thanks for meeting me.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.280
Yeah, sorry it's on the move,
you know, it's a busy time
with the vote coming up.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.320
The office said you had some
questions about an activist?

14:26.320 --> 14:28.880
Aye, Jade Antoniak.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.880
She was seen getting into your car
yesterday

14:30.880 --> 14:32.560
at Kirkmouth police station.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.400
That's right, yeah, it was a favour.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.200
Why were you doing
favours for Ms Antoniak?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.360
I barely knew her.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.960
We have other friends at the
Peace Camp, I did it for them.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.400
Activists tend to be a little wary,
don't they? You said "knew her".

14:46.400 --> 14:48.240
So?

14:48.240 --> 14:49.760
I didn't tell you she was dead.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.080
We have plenty of friends
at the Peace Camp.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.800
Where were you around
nine o'clock last night,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.040
if you don't mind me asking?

15:01.040 --> 15:04.400
I was at my girlfriend's 30th.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.600
The Crown and Thorn, yeah.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.920
I got home around 3am. For God's
sake, don't tell the boss!

15:12.280 --> 15:14.520
I'll need to check that.
Yeah, you do what you like.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.040
Look, um, we've got
two more of these before lunch...

15:17.040 --> 15:19.400
..so I really can't be holding

15:17.040 --> 15:19.400
everyone up.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.400
I'd like you to come
down to the station this afternoon.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.440
I've got a few more
questions for you.

15:26.440 --> 15:30.400
Are you asking or telling?
How's 2pm?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.520
Sure.

15:34.520 --> 15:38.080
Thanks very much, folks. That's all
I've got time for today...

15:59.280 --> 16:01.960
You coming? Burke's memorial.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.520
Everyone not on watch
is supposed to be there.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.600
I'm not sure I'm wanted, am I?

16:06.600 --> 16:09.200
Um...

16:09.200 --> 16:12.400
We're all, um, here for you.
You know that, don't you?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.440
Going soft on me, shipmate?

16:15.840 --> 16:17.120
Prick!

16:24.200 --> 16:27.000
# O Holy Spirit!

16:27.000 --> 16:29.760
# Who didst brood

16:29.760 --> 16:35.880
# Upon the waters dark and rude

16:37.040 --> 16:43.360
# And bid their angry tumult cease

16:43.360 --> 16:50.680
# And give, for wild confusion,
peace

16:50.680 --> 16:57.640
# Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee

16:57.640 --> 17:05.080
# For those in peril on the sea. #

17:10.040 --> 17:12.760
Craig Burke was a force of nature.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.440
On that we can all agree.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.200
He was passionate, and talented.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.280
Now, I know this has been
a tricky patrol,

17:24.280 --> 17:28.080
but we come together today to give
a valued member of our crew

17:28.080 --> 17:29.640
the send-off he deserves.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.760
Sir.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.720
As many of you will know,
a few hours ago,

17:41.720 --> 17:45.040
two of our crew members were
detained for serious breaches.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.400
I want to clarify that those
arrests did not relate

17:50.400 --> 17:51.960
to the death of Craig Burke.

17:51.960 --> 17:55.360
That is an ongoing investigation,
and your continued cooperation

17:55.360 --> 17:57.280
greatly appreciated.

17:57.280 --> 18:02.520
We are, as we were at the beginning
of patrol, a professional crew.

18:02.520 --> 18:09.600
Committed to the mission,
to each other, keeping Britain safe.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.800
That task remains paramount.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.800
We'll now have a reading.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.800
Mark 16. Verse 40.

18:24.800 --> 18:29.000
And when the sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.880
and Mary the mother of James,
and Salome...

18:31.880 --> 18:35.920
..bought spices so that they might
go to anoint Jesus' body.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.280
Very early on the first
day of the week, just after sunrise,

18:40.280 --> 18:44.000
they were on their way to the tomb
and they asked each other,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.720
"Who will roll the stone away
from the entrance of the tomb?"

18:54.240 --> 18:57.640
Mummy, I want to stay with you.
Mummy, please.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.120
I want to stay with you, Mummy.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.480
Mummy! Mummy!

19:16.240 --> 19:19.880
As they entered the tomb, they saw a
young man dressed in white robes...

19:21.720 --> 19:23.640
You OK? Yeah.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.600
Your cook looks upset.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.000
Jackie, yeah,
she's taken it pretty badly.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.520
Her son's been in a bad
place lately.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.920
What about Lieutenant Docherty?
What about her?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.040
What was her
relationship like with Burke?

19:48.040 --> 19:50.920
Oh, can you just
stop for five minutes?

19:50.920 --> 19:52.720
We're at a memorial service.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.480
Chief Petty Officer Deerborne.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.400
How is it?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.960
The ankle? Mm.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.760
Least of my worries.
It's more the boredom.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.480
Might have to take up knitting.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.320
I wanted to talk to you
about Port Havers.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.880
Oh, yeah?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.800
The party boat stuff.
You were there.

20:37.200 --> 20:41.000
Nope. I went across to Tampa.
My sister lives there.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.080
But you must've
heard about it from other crew?

20:43.080 --> 20:45.520
Run ashore, bit of skylarking.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.360
You've been stuck at sea for weeks,
it happens.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.680
What about Burke?

20:49.680 --> 20:52.120
Burke was off his face
and smashed up his cabin,

20:52.120 --> 20:54.320
saying he got
spiked by someone in the crew.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.400
Who'd want to spike him?
Take your pick!

20:57.640 --> 21:01.280
Listen, we all had to do piss tests,
we all got cleared.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.440
He was just trying to shift the
blame for what he did, wasn't he?

21:05.440 --> 21:07.680
Did the Navy believe him?
No.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.880
And with the damage he caused
he got kicked off our boat,

21:10.880 --> 21:13.000
lost his chances of a promotion.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.480
It's only cos of this
he got let back on.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.800
And what do you think
happened at Port Havers?

21:22.520 --> 21:25.920
Like I said, all the urine tests
came back negative.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.760
No, see, John,
that's not what I asked.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.800
I wasn't there when it happened.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.440
Whatever you might have
thought of him,

21:35.440 --> 21:37.880
Craig Burke's family are grieving.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.760
And now a young woman has been
killed as well,

21:41.760 --> 21:43.160
which we think may be connected.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.840
And I believe if people had talked
to us earlier, she might have lived.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.000
She was 24.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.960
This can never,
ever come back to me. Mm.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.920
Look at Davis.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.840
There was a problem with Davis.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.320
I don't know Davis. Is he crew?
I can't do this.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.120
Please, just tell me that.
I can't!

22:16.880 --> 22:20.240
I've got to go, I'm sorry.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.640
I was just about to call you.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.240
Is there a Davis on the Vigil
crew list?

22:34.240 --> 22:35.520
Bear with.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.680
No Davis. What's this about?

22:41.680 --> 22:42.800
Florida.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.920
Could be a past member of Vigil.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.320
Check US Navy personnel
at Port Havers as well. On it.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.720
Oh, and the hair on Burke's
drug test -

22:51.720 --> 22:53.200
I'm pretty sure that was his own.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.000
He was trying to prove he'd
been spiked.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.400
Shit.

22:56.400 --> 23:01.120
In other news, Jade's bank account
and phone records are in.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.040
She got paid a grand a month by a
limited company

23:04.040 --> 23:07.600
called Ansell Holdings.
I've looked into it,

23:07.600 --> 23:09.920
and you'll never guess who the
sole director is.

23:09.920 --> 23:13.600
Who? The guy you spoke to this
morning, Mark Hill.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.280
What about the phone logs?
Any calls last night?

23:19.280 --> 23:22.560
No, you were right, she must have
been using an encrypted app.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.840
But I've been looking further back,

23:24.840 --> 23:26.800
and that's
when things get interesting.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.080
Over the past year,

23:28.080 --> 23:30.880
there's a pattern of late night
calls with one number.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.440
Hill?

23:33.440 --> 23:34.760
Nope.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.240
His boss, the MP Patrick Cruden.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.360
If you're interested,
he's at the City Chambers right now.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.680
OK, I'm heading in.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.240
I don't think I have anything
more to say to you.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.560
Have they told you about Burke
being poisoned? Mm.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.640
OK, I've got a few questions. I'd
appreciate if you could answer them.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.640
If you co-operate,
I'll note it in my report.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.760
It'll help.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.120
You haven't lost everything, Mark.

24:22.120 --> 24:26.960
Lieutenant Commander Prentice.
I haven't been discharged just yet.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.920
Well, maybe it won't come to that.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.080
Yeah, right!

24:36.680 --> 24:39.200
What's the worst thing about this
situation for you?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.120
It's that I've let my crew down.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.200
Vigil needs a strong XO.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.560
It's why the Admiralty posted me
here in the first place.

24:54.560 --> 25:00.400
I mean, Newsome has some merits
but discipline had slipped badly.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.400
That's to do with Florida?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.480
Yeah, Port Havers, last year.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.080
The boat went over for missile
servicing.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.480
Crew went out,
things got out of hand.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.600
Drinking, fighting in the street.
And drugs?

25:16.360 --> 25:19.120
Burke created
a problem for the Navy there.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.640
He kept insisting he'd been spiked,
which created an obvious

25:21.640 --> 25:23.880
discrepancy with the official drugs
test results.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.120
Implying that the Navy had
falsified their findings.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.760
I doubt the Admiralty would have
swept that under the carpet.

25:28.760 --> 25:32.040
Far more likely is that the original
urine samples had been...

25:33.200 --> 25:34.560
..had been tampered with.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.760
How are these tests done?

25:39.800 --> 25:43.720
Back at base, there's...
Well, there's very strict protocol.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.680
I don't know how they do them
abroad.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.480
Doctor probably oversaw them.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.760
Lieutenant Docherty?
Yes. You'd have to ask her.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.240
So why didn't the Navy take Burke's
claims more seriously?

25:56.320 --> 25:57.600
I don't know. It's just...

25:59.600 --> 26:03.240
..I'm trying to think why they might
have wanted to avoid more scrutiny.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.880
Did anything else happen with
Vigil in that period?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.800
Well, if it did, Command never
shared that information with me.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.360
And we certainly don't need
any more scandals.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.560
I appreciate this.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.720
Yeah.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.840
Well, you're trying to keep
the crew safe, and...

26:31.120 --> 26:32.760
..well, that's what matters.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.760
Have you got permission to
be in there?

26:43.760 --> 26:46.280
Prentice is about to be court
martialled.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.760
You shouldn't be seeing him
without a chaperone.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.680
Amy?
Are you being honest with me?

26:56.680 --> 26:58.520
Am I being honest with you?
About what?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.240
Burke was gathering information.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.720
Kierly told me she took it to
Newsome. Did you know about that?

27:02.720 --> 27:05.440
Oh, for God's sake! Newsome would've
told him to stop gossiping.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.920
In fact, I doubt Burke even did it.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.160
He was probably just trying to get
a rise out of Kierly.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.920
And the Port Havers drug tests?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.480
Yeah, well, most of the crew
were relieved

27:13.480 --> 27:15.840
when the tests came back negative.
Burke wasn't.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.800
He said he was spiked.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.640
You knew about that.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.360
And you didn't tell me.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.320
I didn't think that it was relevant.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.200
Burke had a whole
list of petty grievances.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.320
That doesn't make them all real.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.800
Look, I've helped you.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.640
I've gone over and above.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.600
Now, I can see that you're not
coping down here

27:32.600 --> 27:34.040
but I'm not the enemy.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.440
OK, Go on. Ask me.
Ask me anything. I'll tell you.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.800
Did Lieutenant Docherty have any
involvement in carrying out
the drug tests? Yes.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.400
Is there anything else you think
I should know about her?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.160
Like what, for example?

27:48.760 --> 27:51.920
I had a message
back from my colleagues on land.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.880
Craig Burke's girlfriend was
murdered yesterday.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.080
What? I also know that Burke had
an illicit photo

28:00.080 --> 28:01.600
of Docherty with someone.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.000
Who? I don't know, I can't
decipher my colleague's message.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.080
But Docherty has access to
pharmaceuticals on board.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.400
She knows how to use them.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.160
She told us that she gave Burke
a paracetamol for a headache.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.920
And you add in her involvement
with the Florida drugs tests -

28:15.920 --> 28:18.840
she has means, motive
and the opportunity to kill Burke.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.240
I need to speak to her now.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.080
Yes, come in.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.800
We've studied the tiles
from the sink site, sir.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.840
Yes. The engineers are unanimous.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.320
And?

28:39.320 --> 28:40.960
It wasn't the Russians.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.560
So, no contact whatsoever?
No, sir.

28:45.560 --> 28:49.560
Checked all bands, all frequencies
on all sonar sets. Still nothing.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.160
How long?

28:51.160 --> 28:52.520
It's been five days.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.640
No ASW contact. Sir.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.320
As far as we can tell,
there's no-one trailing us.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.880
Sir?

29:00.960 --> 29:03.720
Get out of here.
Sir, I have to talk to you.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.800
Carry on.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.960
Sir, am I still facing discharge?

29:15.960 --> 29:17.800
Now you know
I never planted the drugs?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.640
You still brought the heroin
onboard, didn't you?
Has that changed?

29:20.640 --> 29:23.240
What...what happened in Port Havers
though, sir, that was...

29:23.240 --> 29:24.600
Are you threatening me?

29:26.920 --> 29:30.760
No, sir. You keep your mouth shut,
otherwise discharge will be
the least of your problems.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.640
Dismissed.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.080
Dismissed.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.400
Show me that printout.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.720
Rear Admiral Shaw. We came as soon
as we got your message.

30:01.720 --> 30:05.440
Ray Kohli, MI5. And this
is Laura Michaels.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.520
As far as I'm aware, we are
not at war with the United States.
Is that correct?

30:09.800 --> 30:12.000
We are not at war, sir, no.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.080
So perhaps MI5 can explain to me

30:14.080 --> 30:17.200
why a Los Angeles-class submarine
brought down a fishing trawler

30:17.200 --> 30:20.600
four days ago,
while covertly tracking HMS Vigil?

30:20.600 --> 30:23.640
Because, objectively, it's a
staggering act of hostility

30:23.640 --> 30:25.280
from a supposed ally.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.920
We'll talk to the Pentagon
immediately. Do that.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.160
And while you're there, ask them
why we had to send down divers

30:32.160 --> 30:34.120
to find out this bloody information!

30:34.120 --> 30:36.760
I think we all know
the answer to that, sir.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.280
There's still considerable tension

30:40.280 --> 30:42.000
because of the incident
at Port Havers.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.160
So it's our fault?

30:44.160 --> 30:46.080
You're intelligence. Find out.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.240
We will.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.840
But perhaps we should use the time
we have to discuss Craig Burke

30:52.840 --> 30:54.320
and Jade Antoniak?

31:01.640 --> 31:05.000
Sir, signal from CTF 345.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.360
Jesus!

31:12.360 --> 31:13.520
Carry on. Aye, Sir.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.120
Mr Hill.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.720
Officer. It's not gone 2pm?

32:57.720 --> 33:00.040
Oh, that's not why I'm here.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.320
Where's your boss?

33:02.640 --> 33:05.000
I'd like to
talk about Ansell Holdings.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.080
Why were you paying Jade?

33:08.080 --> 33:10.400
And why use a shell
company to do it?

33:13.200 --> 33:16.000
I think the two of you were paying
her for Trident information

33:16.000 --> 33:17.720
and then leaking it to the press.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.920
I think you briefed them
just today on Burke's death.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.120
OK, this is ridiculous.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.120
And it certainly has nothing to
do with Patrick.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.600
Jade's phone records tell
a different story, don't they?

33:26.600 --> 33:30.760
If you can't tell me why you and
Jade had late-night calls going back

33:30.760 --> 33:33.720
a year, well, then maybe I should
ask your wife, shouldn't I,
Mr Cruden?

33:35.440 --> 33:38.000
Did you have anything to do
with Jade's death?

33:38.000 --> 33:41.400
OK, we're done here.
Mark! Give us a minute, please.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.040
Patrick?

33:45.040 --> 33:47.480
It's OK. It's fine.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.160
I'll be right outside.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.240
It's not what you think.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.080
What do I think?
An affair.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.480
It's not that.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.960
She was my daughter.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.240
I had a fling with her mother,
back in my CND days.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.760
Jade came to see me last year.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.760
It was hard.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.480
But we were getting there, you know?

34:42.720 --> 34:44.720
What about the company?

34:44.720 --> 34:46.840
I asked Mark to set that up.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.880
Why?

34:49.120 --> 34:51.280
So that I could give Jade
an allowance.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.920
My wife didn't know about her.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.120
Still doesn't.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.480
Is it true that Jade was drowned?

35:04.200 --> 35:05.640
I'm afraid so.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.760
I understand this must be difficult.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.480
But if there's anything that you
think might be relevant to

35:20.480 --> 35:23.400
this investigation,
I need you to share it with me.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.440
She said she was being followed.
OK.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.880
When did she tell you that?
Recently.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.160
She'd had her laptop stolen.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.400
She was convinced MI5 had
people in the Peace Camp.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.480
Why would MI5 be following her?

35:37.480 --> 35:39.480
Because of Craig Burke.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.520
You know about the USB stick.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.160
I can't comment on that.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.920
She told me you had it.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.680
Burke saw himself as a
whistle-blower.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.360
A few weeks ago, he got nervous.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.680
He told her he was on to something,
some incident in the States.

35:57.680 --> 36:01.200
There were fatalities, a crew member
was shipped off to the Middle East.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.040
A cover-up?
I didn't get all the details.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.240
But I do know that he was
conflicted about it. Why?

36:08.240 --> 36:12.440
Because he had something that showed
these boats weren't fit for purpose.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.120
And he thought this could
spell the end of it.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.240
He actually said that to you?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.320
I asked to speak to him,
but he wouldn't.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.240
Everything went through Jade.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.120
Got an update on Davis. Aye?

36:33.120 --> 36:34.840
Sort of. Go on.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.280
Well, there's no sign of him
on any Dunloch HR files,

36:38.280 --> 36:40.120
but I did notice something else.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.440
There's this guy in Vigil's crew
list from Port Havers.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.200
A few weeks later, he's gone.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.600
Ross Harmison - junior rate.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.920
Probably nothing but...
Transferred to the Middle East?

36:50.920 --> 36:54.040
Bahrain. HMS Riffa.
How did you know that?

36:54.040 --> 36:55.640
Have you looked him up?

36:55.640 --> 36:58.720
Tried. Been told he's on operations.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.560
Right, OK.
Put me through to Robertson.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.600
Can't. He's in briefing MI5.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.760
They showed up out of the blue,
half an hour ago.

37:07.760 --> 37:10.040
Right. OK. I'm coming in.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.760
Well, thank you for your time.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.520
We'll be in touch.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.120
How much did you tell them?

37:56.120 --> 37:57.680
As little as possible.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.280
How are you getting on?

38:14.280 --> 38:17.520
I think we're looking at three
options, based on Burke's symptoms.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.960
There's a drug called Pilocarpine.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.320
What's going on?

38:24.320 --> 38:27.840
My colleagues on land have been
investigating
the cover-up of some drugs tests.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.240
The tests that were done on Vigil's
crew when you were last in Florida.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.720
I think you cheated them,
and I'm going to give you

38:33.720 --> 38:36.320
the opportunity to be honest with me
about that. What?

38:36.320 --> 38:38.960
I don't know what you're talking
about... I'm tired, Tiffany.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.000
Don't get on the wrong side
of me today.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.200
I switched some of the samples.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.440
OK. Whose?

38:52.440 --> 38:55.240
I won't give you their names.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.080
I was told to get the samples
ready for transfer to the lab,

38:58.080 --> 38:59.840
so I switched them for clean urine.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.120
Where did you get it from?

39:01.120 --> 39:04.320
I knew the tests were going to
happen, so I had a bit of time.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.880
I paid some American recruits.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.840
Did someone pressure
you into doing that? No.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.560
I don't believe you.
Why, then?

39:11.560 --> 39:13.560
Because they're my friends.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.680
And I knew they'd messed up.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.680
Think about the job.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.960
You're asking people to leave
their families at short notice,
for long stretches.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.160
You're asking them to put up with
loneliness, and boredom,

39:25.160 --> 39:26.960
and a total lack of privacy.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.720
When we come alongside,
people let off steam. That's coping,

39:31.720 --> 39:35.280
and they don't deserve to
lose their careers over it.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.160
I think you're covering.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.960
I think someone told you to do it.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.320
I take full responsibility.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.080
That's a carefully worded answer.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.800
Craig Burke's girlfriend died
yesterday.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.640
Were you pressured into doing
anything else?

39:53.000 --> 39:56.480
Like what? Someone on this boat
poisoned Craig Burke.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.160
And you think that was me?

39:59.600 --> 40:02.960
Why would I do that?
I know about the photo.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.840
What photo? The photo that Burke
had of you, with a man.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.720
Was he blackmailing you?

40:10.120 --> 40:13.520
What are you talking about? Burke
was upset about the drugs tests.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.160
He knew they were cheated
and that caused problems for him,

40:16.160 --> 40:19.000
but he never mentioned...
There was never any blackmail.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.000
Please...

40:24.920 --> 40:26.320
What's this photo?

40:32.200 --> 40:36.000
Oh...so you like my cooking now,
do you?

41:28.120 --> 41:29.400
I don't have much time.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.880
That's fine.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.360
This won't take long.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.400
You'll note the date
on that drugs test.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.600
What is this?
We were hoping you could tell us.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.720
I've never seen this before.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.320
Where did you get this information?

41:47.320 --> 41:50.800
It's come to light during the course
of our investigation.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.000
Craig Burke left it on a digital
storage device.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.960
Was Tiffany Docherty pressured
into cheating the drugs tests

41:56.960 --> 41:59.160
done in Port Havers? Absolutely not.

41:59.160 --> 42:02.040
But you can see why that might be
seen as a legitimate

42:02.040 --> 42:04.680
line of inquiry,
based on what we have here.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.240
I hardly know what you have.
I've not seen this before.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.080
Does the name Ross Harmison mean
anything to you?

42:11.560 --> 42:14.960
Harmison was
a junior mechanic on Vigil.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.760
Shortly after the boat
was in Port Havers,

42:17.760 --> 42:21.040
he was transferred to
HMS Riffa in the Middle East.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.160
I'd like to know if there was a
particular reason for that.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.240
The submarine service
isn't for everyone.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.680
Ratings are allowed to
apply for a transfer.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.120
Let's talk about Davis Marine, then.

42:32.120 --> 42:36.240
It's a naval services company,
based out of US Port Havers.

42:36.240 --> 42:40.880
Now, 18 months ago, there were
local press reports of two

42:40.880 --> 42:44.280
Davis Marine contractors
drowning in the harbour.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.040
I've looked at the dates,

42:46.040 --> 42:49.840
and this happened the morning after
Vigil's crew got wasted.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.200
What does this have to do
with your inquiry?

42:52.200 --> 42:54.480
It's a little bit strange, isn't it?

42:54.480 --> 42:57.880
Two contractors going for a dip
in a deep-water harbour

42:57.880 --> 42:59.520
on a Tuesday morning?

43:00.640 --> 43:03.920
I've got sources who suggest
that these deaths were linked

43:03.920 --> 43:07.320
to Vigil,
and that a cover-up took place.

43:07.320 --> 43:11.240
Now, we've also been told
by multiple sources that Jade

43:11.240 --> 43:14.040
thought that the Navy
or MI5 was watching her,

43:14.040 --> 43:16.960
and possibly knew about her
relationship with Craig Burke.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.720
We all know there have been
a lot of leaks recently.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.640
Was the Navy concerned that
Burke might tell Jade what

43:23.640 --> 43:25.440
he knew about Port Havers?

43:25.440 --> 43:29.000
Are you suggesting the Navy murdered
Craig Burke and Jade Antoniak?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.680
We're fact-finding.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.880
Part of our job is to ask
difficult questions.

43:33.880 --> 43:37.560
Now, the question is whether the
Navy saw Burke as a security risk.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.640
Well, ask yourself this. If we'd
thought he was a security risk,

43:40.640 --> 43:43.880
would we have let him back on board?
The Peace Camp always think

43:43.880 --> 43:46.280
they're being spied on.
It helps them feel important.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.400
I'm confident someone was
watching me earlier.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.080
That wouldn't have been us.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.520
The Armed Forces don't
spy on the police.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.200
This isn't North Korea.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.840
OK then.
Thank you for your time today.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.440
That's it?

44:01.440 --> 44:04.240
We've asked our questions, they've
been good enough to answer them.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.400
Aye, but I wasn't...
That'll do, Kirsten.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.160
So, what are you thinking?

44:16.160 --> 44:18.880
I'm thinking she's telling
the truth.

44:18.880 --> 44:20.960
Look, maybe we're
looking at the wrong person.

44:20.960 --> 44:24.040
In what way? The photograph.

44:24.040 --> 44:27.120
Have you got any idea who she might
have been sleeping with?

44:27.120 --> 44:30.520
If it was anybody on the boat,
then I'm sure I'd know about it.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.800
Walsh?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.480
What are you doing?

44:37.280 --> 44:39.080
Shit. Put the gun down.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.240
Shut your fucking mouth.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.680
You've really fucked me,
do you know that?

44:43.680 --> 44:45.040
I've got nothing left.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.560
I was just brought here
to understand why someone died.

44:49.560 --> 44:52.400
I'm not to blame for him dying!
No-one's saying that you are.

44:52.400 --> 44:56.440
Prentice planted the gear on him,
not me. Yeah. He's admitted that.

44:56.440 --> 44:59.400
No-one's trying to blame you. But
Harmison kills whoever, and he what,

44:59.400 --> 45:02.680
he gets a transfer out of it? A bit
of sunshine and a nice new gig?

45:02.680 --> 45:04.880
How's that justice? Gary, mate...

45:04.880 --> 45:06.480
I did my job.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.000
I nearly died doing my job
on this patrol,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.760
and who's got my back? Gary, please.
Just put the gun down.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.120
Shut up! Put the gun down, mate.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.760
The point is...

45:19.320 --> 45:21.360
..it's not fair.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.920
Fuck it. Amy, don't. Gary...

45:26.920 --> 45:30.040
Stay away from me!
Gary, listen to me.

45:30.040 --> 45:33.080
I don't know you well, OK?

45:33.080 --> 45:35.440
But I know there's a lot of people
on this boat that think

45:35.440 --> 45:37.960
a great deal of you, whether you're
in the service or not. No,

45:37.960 --> 45:41.960
you don't understand. No, you're
wrong. I do, I do understand.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.200
I'm not going to tell you how great
life is, because I've...

45:47.880 --> 45:50.240
..I've been exactly where you are.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.120
Gary, look at me.

45:55.400 --> 45:59.160
I watched my boyfriend die,
and it was my fault.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.000
And now his mum won't let me see
the girl that we brought up together

46:02.000 --> 46:04.600
and that fucking broke me.

46:04.600 --> 46:05.920
Gary.

46:07.080 --> 46:09.440
Gary, look at me. No...

46:09.440 --> 46:11.280
I know something that you
don't right now.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.000
Oh, yeah, what's that, then?

46:18.680 --> 46:21.200
That there are still
some bits of light.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.080
Something or...

46:28.080 --> 46:31.680
..or someone will come along
and make it seem worth it.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.560
You have to picture it right now.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.200
Because if you do it...

46:40.760 --> 46:42.920
..there's no going back.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.960
 I think you might consider
trying paroxetine.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.480
Is there any chance that
you could be pregnant

47:13.480 --> 47:15.360
or might become pregnant?

47:19.360 --> 47:22.280
I think your records
are all pretty recent.

47:22.280 --> 47:26.400
Um, any changes since the crash?

47:26.400 --> 47:29.800
Epilepsy, blood sugars,
blood pressure all normal?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.800
No.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.920
Everything's the same.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.000
Do you want to talk about us
signing you off work for a bit?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.920
No. I don't want to stop work.

47:44.680 --> 47:48.880
There is a waiting list for
counselling, but I think it might...

47:48.880 --> 47:52.280
Why does everyone want me to talk?
What is there to say?

47:52.280 --> 47:54.640
I miss them.

47:54.640 --> 47:56.520
I used to have them both
curled up in my bed

47:56.520 --> 47:57.960
and now I don't have either of them.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.920
I haven't even got the right to see
Poppy, never mind...

48:04.560 --> 48:06.920
It's not complicated.
I just miss them.

48:14.640 --> 48:16.440
I'll try the paroxetine.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.320
Can I get you anything else?

48:33.600 --> 48:34.920
No.

48:38.240 --> 48:40.800
I'm sorry to have to ask this, but

48:40.800 --> 48:44.280
back there you mentioned an incident
with someone called Harmison.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.400
Was that in Florida?

48:50.320 --> 48:51.480
Aye.

48:52.720 --> 48:55.880
It was when we were in Port Havers
for missile servicing.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.440
Last year? Yeah.

48:59.200 --> 49:02.120
We docked,
and straight away most of us

49:02.120 --> 49:05.640
got let off for a bit of shore
leave, Harmison included.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.280
Duty watch had the reactor on
cool-down for maintenance.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.400
Harmison got back early doors
to relieve them,

49:14.400 --> 49:17.160
but he was still half-pissed and
coming down off God knows what,

49:17.160 --> 49:19.040
so he went for a kip.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.680
Didn't notice the cold water
hose failing.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.320
Is that serious? Aye.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.800
Aye, it shouldnae happen.

49:28.800 --> 49:32.680
The reactor temperature was
skyrocketing, he was fast asleep.

49:32.680 --> 49:34.920
The generators were
over-pressurised, we had 70 bar

49:34.920 --> 49:37.600
of steam flying round corroded
old pipes and naebody had a clue.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.960
So what happened?

49:40.960 --> 49:43.480
I was back aft running
hydroplane checks.

49:45.400 --> 49:49.440
There were two contractors
in the turbine room, local guys.

49:50.960 --> 49:54.160
One of the pipes must've cracked
under the pressure, because

49:54.160 --> 49:55.640
I heard screaming.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.200
And by the time that
I'd got there...

50:03.160 --> 50:06.360
..they'd been cooked alive.
Oh, Jesus.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.480
So what did you do?

50:11.480 --> 50:13.960
I legged it to the manoeuvring room,
woke up Harmison,

50:13.960 --> 50:16.240
and we called the EO to initiate
cool-down procedures.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.240
Thank God we caught it when we did.

50:20.240 --> 50:24.280
A few degrees hotter, and we were
looking at another Fukushima.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.840
I'm talking a nuclear meltdown

50:25.840 --> 50:29.120
causing a massive hydrogen
explosion. Catastrophic.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.840
We were that close.
And Newsome knew? Aye, he had to.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.960
All got hushed up pretty quickly.

50:36.960 --> 50:39.320
You know, me and Harmison
and the others who were there

50:39.320 --> 50:41.880
taken into a room
and told to sew our mouths shut.

50:41.880 --> 50:43.960
Officially, they just drowned.

50:43.960 --> 50:46.120
And Burke knew? Aye.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.480
God knows how HE found out.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.960
Then again, he has shit
on everybody.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.680
Harmison messed up big time.

50:55.880 --> 50:58.440
But the truth is these boats
are on their last legs

50:58.440 --> 51:01.240
and naebody wants to talk about it.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.000
There's too much at stake.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.880
Burke talked a lot of shite,
but he was right about that.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.320
The medic will see you now.
I'll take you over.

51:12.120 --> 51:14.080
Go and lie down and sober up.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.280
You're a decent man, Gary.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.400
I'm going to make sure you get
the help that you need.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.920
Don't be long. We need to speak to
Newsome. Yes, ma'am.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.600
"Burke had photo of doc,
plus another.

51:44.600 --> 51:47.360
"Weak visual on him,
but he's got my favourite book."

52:20.480 --> 52:22.240
Oh, God.

52:43.360 --> 52:47.000
Hello. We have a situation up here
that needs to be contained.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.880
Detective Longacre to Control.
Can you run a plate for me?

53:15.880 --> 53:17.280
Go ahead.

53:17.280 --> 53:20.000
I'm heading northbound
through the Clyde Tunnel.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.920
Looks like a black SUV tailing me.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.720
Yankee, Charlie, two, zero...

53:27.960 --> 53:31.640
..Oscar, Golf, X-ray. Standby.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.840
Nothing in the system, Sarge. Shit.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.040
Have we got any other cars in the
area? Checking for you now.

53:37.040 --> 53:41.640
You're looking at five to ten
minutes. Shit. Busy one tonight.

53:41.640 --> 53:43.960
Oh, fuck's sake. Jesus.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.360
Sarge? Am I sending units? Um...

53:46.360 --> 53:49.920
Where's the nearest multi-story
car park? Er, Renfrew Street.

53:49.920 --> 53:53.480
Right, OK.
Control, I'm heading there now.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.040
Send backup.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.440
Is there anyone there?

54:09.040 --> 54:10.840
You can't be in here.

54:10.840 --> 54:13.480
How did he get the photo?
Burke stole it from my phone.

54:13.480 --> 54:15.320
But you didn't tell me that.

54:15.320 --> 54:18.600
Why didn't you tell me that?
Cos there's so much going on.

54:21.680 --> 54:24.520
It's OK. I won't say anything.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.280
You should go.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.560
Control, I'm en route, blues on.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.240
I'm one minute out from car park.
What's the ETA?

55:01.240 --> 55:03.560
ETA five minutes. Do not engage.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.520
Repeat, do not engage.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.360
Shit! No.

55:19.520 --> 55:22.760
Come on. Where are they?
Backup four minutes out.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.560
Control, where's that backup?

55:34.560 --> 55:37.400
ETA three minutes, at least.

55:37.400 --> 55:39.600
They're supposed to be here now!

55:44.680 --> 55:46.960
Do not engage. Wait for backup.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.320
Repeat, wait for backup.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.400
Right, OK. I'm on the roof.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.080
I am decamping.

55:53.080 --> 55:55.720
Do not engage.
Repeat, do not engage.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.480
Police. I've backup on the way.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.320
Who are you, why are you foll...

56:05.200 --> 56:07.720
I know you. You're MI5.

56:07.720 --> 56:09.600
You need to come with us.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.040
Did you get anything
else from Walsh?

56:28.040 --> 56:29.320
No.

56:30.680 --> 56:32.320
Everything OK?

56:32.320 --> 56:34.360
I'm tired, I...

56:34.360 --> 56:36.240
I need to get some sleep.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.680
What about Newsome? He can wait.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.680
Are you going to move?
