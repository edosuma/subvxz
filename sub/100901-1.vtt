WEBVTT

00:06.731 --> 00:09.398
(ominous music)

00:15.566 --> 00:18.233
(ominous music)

01:44.200 --> 01:47.761
[Faust] All you need to be a
doctor is confidence.

01:47.761 --> 01:48.810
(chuckling)

01:48.810 --> 01:51.010
[Gretchen] Confidence
doesn't cure cancer.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.130
You think you could tell a dying man

01:54.130 --> 01:55.830
what medicine he needs without it?

01:57.310 --> 01:59.110
I think the drugs would help more.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.313
Of course, it doesn't
matter in the long run.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.479
A patient who has cancer is
probably gonna die anyway.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.854
If you're tending to him, maybe.

02:10.854 --> 02:13.890
(snickering)

02:13.890 --> 02:15.790
Doesn't change the facts.

02:15.790 --> 02:17.863
All men are mortal.

02:19.510 --> 02:22.107
I can't believe no one's
thought of that before.

02:22.107 --> 02:23.024
Hey, hey.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.810
There's a first time for everything.

02:27.090 --> 02:31.240
Sure, and maybe someday

02:31.240 --> 02:33.250
you'll just shut up and do your work

02:33.250 --> 02:35.483
without complaining for once.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.500
Some things are beyond the reach of man.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.800
With what we have here,

02:45.840 --> 02:47.523
we're firing in the dark.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.763
We might as well give up.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.420
What's the point of saving anybody's life

02:56.420 --> 02:58.120
if they're just gonna end up dead?

03:04.260 --> 03:08.520
So, if there was a bullet
in your leg right now,

03:08.520 --> 03:09.970
what would you want me to do?

03:11.990 --> 03:14.960
Why, you planning on putting one there?

03:14.960 --> 03:18.363
If you don't stop being
so stubborn, who knows?

03:19.210 --> 03:20.043
Well?

03:22.130 --> 03:24.230
Sure, I'd want you to call an ambulance.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.743
But it wouldn't matter.

03:28.430 --> 03:31.543
Even if I were to survive,
even if I were to recover,

03:33.150 --> 03:34.830
someday I will die.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.273
And someday so will you.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.610
Another brilliant observation.

03:40.610 --> 03:42.570
If you're gonna be throwing
this many nuggets of wisdom

03:42.570 --> 03:45.540
my way, you should really
be charging by the hour.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.113
I consider it charity work.

03:50.860 --> 03:54.090
It's just one life, one death.

03:54.090 --> 03:56.150
Sure, a couple people may cry over it

03:57.160 --> 03:58.970
but it wouldn't matter to the world.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.320
Not to history, not to eternity.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.380
Unless you were someone like Jonas Salk.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.653
But even then.
Even then?

04:10.350 --> 04:14.430
Salk is dead, but his work lives.

04:14.430 --> 04:16.500
And not because of some text book

04:16.500 --> 04:19.202
but because he made the
impossible possible.

04:20.589 --> 04:25.370
But even if he never did
that, it wouldn't matter.

04:25.370 --> 04:30.230
At the end of the day, there's
just really one disease.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.700
I've been pouring over
this brick for three months

04:32.700 --> 04:34.400
and I can assure you
that there is, in fact,

04:34.400 --> 04:36.430
more than one disease.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.053
There's only one that matters.

04:45.331 --> 04:47.998
(metal tapping)

04:51.844 --> 04:54.511
(door knocking)

04:58.406 --> 05:00.610
(throat clearing)

05:00.610 --> 05:01.563
Can I help you?

05:06.030 --> 05:07.210
This is...

05:08.460 --> 05:09.913
This is Wagner.

05:12.190 --> 05:14.730
Yeah, I know what he is.

05:14.730 --> 05:15.683
Be nice.

05:17.090 --> 05:21.600
Of course, it's always nice
for the dropout to drop in.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.433
Stop it.

05:32.939 --> 05:36.970
You know, that's a bad guy you go with.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.393
Do you have the pills?

05:42.845 --> 05:45.845
(contents rattling)

05:50.780 --> 05:51.660
These are breath mints.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.793
Oh, sorry.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.630
Thanks.

06:06.090 --> 06:08.483
Do you have the other thing?

06:12.180 --> 06:14.963
I had my friend run some
tests on those samples.

06:29.570 --> 06:32.270
Is this...

06:33.690 --> 06:35.300
Is this true?

06:35.300 --> 06:36.163
Trust me.

06:38.510 --> 06:41.333
My friend's very scientific.

06:53.995 --> 06:56.662
(Faust sighing)

06:59.529 --> 07:02.010
(keys dropping)

07:02.010 --> 07:02.843
Gretchen?

07:13.217 --> 07:15.884
(Faust sighing)

07:18.167 --> 07:20.847
(Gretchen groaning)

07:20.847 --> 07:22.263
Come on, get up.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.483
Five more minutes.
I wanna get some food.

07:27.420 --> 07:28.263
Where?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.040
I don't know.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.590
We'll figure it out on the way.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.383
Fine.

07:36.010 --> 07:40.123
[Faust] Okay, actually,
I have to use the bathroom.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
(footsteps leaving)

07:51.103 --> 07:53.686
(door closing)

07:57.694 --> 08:00.444
(dramatic music)

08:02.518 --> 08:05.141
(zipper sliding)

08:05.141 --> 08:06.257
(dramatic music)

08:06.257 --> 08:08.232
(zipper sliding)

08:08.232 --> 08:10.982
(dramatic music)

08:30.658 --> 08:31.491
(zipper sliding)

08:31.491 --> 08:34.241
(dramatic music)

08:59.258 --> 09:02.377
(pills rattling)

09:02.377 --> 09:05.127
(dramatic music)

09:07.452 --> 09:09.217
(pills rattling)

09:09.217 --> 09:11.967
(dramatic music)

09:14.665 --> 09:15.555
(zipper sliding)

09:15.555 --> 09:18.899
(dramatic music)

09:18.899 --> 09:19.732
(zipper sliding)

09:19.732 --> 09:22.425
(dramatic music)

09:22.425 --> 09:23.859
(zipper sliding)

09:23.859 --> 09:26.609
(dramatic music)

09:39.822 --> 09:41.538
(zipper sliding)

09:41.538 --> 09:44.288
(dramatic music)

09:46.818 --> 09:49.401
(door opening)

09:50.513 --> 09:53.180
(water running)

09:59.752 --> 10:02.419
(Faust sighing)

10:03.285 --> 10:04.118
You ready?

10:08.990 --> 10:09.823
Yeah.

10:11.414 --> 10:12.447
Elevator dinging

10:12.447 --> 10:14.523
(doors creaking)

10:14.523 --> 10:16.430
I was thinking pizza.

10:16.430 --> 10:17.393
You down for pizza?

10:18.230 --> 10:19.360
Ah, Faust?

10:19.360 --> 10:21.021
Tacos.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.490
Oh, I could sure do with some tacos.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.463
I saw your book.

10:29.770 --> 10:30.980
You were in my bag?

10:30.980 --> 10:33.003
You're trying to change the subject.

10:36.496 --> 10:38.150
I can't believe you did that.

10:38.150 --> 10:39.570
I want you to look me in the eye

10:39.570 --> 10:41.693
and tell me there's no cause for concern.

10:44.521 --> 10:46.590
(Faust sighing)

10:46.590 --> 10:48.773
You wanna hear me say that, hmm?

10:49.610 --> 10:54.590
Fine, there's no cause for concern.

10:54.590 --> 10:55.953
Are you serious?

10:57.540 --> 10:59.230
What's the use of saving people's lives

10:59.230 --> 11:00.930
if they're just gonna end up dead?

11:01.930 --> 11:03.563
You wanna bring back the dead?

11:07.080 --> 11:07.980
That's step one.

11:08.970 --> 11:12.240
After that I wanna end it all.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.880
This pestilence, this
mortal prison forever.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.130
It'd be the greatest advancement
in human civilization

11:20.130 --> 11:21.770
since the invention of the wheel.

11:21.770 --> 11:23.123
This is insane!

11:24.690 --> 11:28.086
It's not insane to want to
make the world a better place.

11:28.086 --> 11:29.500
(Gretchen chuckling)

11:29.500 --> 11:31.610
So you're gonna do
that with some asshole

11:31.610 --> 11:33.360
who thinks he's the devil?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.460
He's not some asshole.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.030
He's the real deal.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.700
So, you're gonna sell
your soul to the devil?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.423
That's your fucking strategy?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.223
I'm gonna have to find him first.

11:51.030 --> 11:53.720
(door shutting)

11:53.720 --> 11:55.293
It's poison, it's all poison.

11:55.293 --> 11:57.020
You can't judge a book by its cover.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.110
The arsenic, the cyanide?

11:59.110 --> 12:00.397
Purely experimental.

12:00.397 --> 12:02.897
(man choking)

12:11.150 --> 12:12.203
Get over here.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.530
He's dying.

12:14.530 --> 12:16.540
We all have to die someday.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.073
He's not dead yet.

12:29.820 --> 12:32.236
So, Chinese okay?

12:32.236 --> 12:34.240
(slapping)

12:34.240 --> 12:35.073
We're done.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.760
Gretchen, Gretchen?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.580
I don't know who you are anymore.

12:40.580 --> 12:43.030
And I won't watch you
destroy yourself like this.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.863
You gotta be kidding me.

12:47.940 --> 12:51.307
I've endured watching you
burn yourself from the inside

12:51.307 --> 12:54.200
with Wagner's shit for years.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.020
That medicine is prescription.

12:56.020 --> 12:58.490
Prescription cocaine?

12:58.490 --> 12:59.810
That was one time.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.187
One time that I know of.

13:01.187 --> 13:02.540
But see, that's not the problem.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.413
The problem is that you're weak.

13:05.355 --> 13:07.920
I don't need this from
you, I don't, I don't.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.291
Stop.
Weak.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.041
(dramatic music)

13:18.496 --> 13:19.459
(Faust sighing)

13:19.459 --> 13:22.209
(dramatic music)

14:36.761 --> 14:39.511
(music swelling)

15:06.598 --> 15:07.547
Now listen to me, kid.

15:07.547 --> 15:09.563
I'm not your fucking mommy.

15:10.490 --> 15:13.610
If anything, I'm the guy
that's fucking your mommy.

15:13.610 --> 15:17.283
And the moment I'm done fucking
her with my big demon cock,

15:18.180 --> 15:19.770
she's gonna be the first person

15:19.770 --> 15:21.723
that you're going to have to resurrect.

15:24.740 --> 15:25.903
Nice to meet you too?

15:27.928 --> 15:31.410
(Mephistopheles grunting)

15:31.410 --> 15:34.160
So you wanna talk to the dead, huh, kid?

15:34.160 --> 15:36.450
I don't just wanna talk to 'em.

15:36.450 --> 15:38.410
I wanna bring them back.

15:38.410 --> 15:41.870
Why, why do you want to raise the dead?

15:41.870 --> 15:43.720
You got a wife?

15:43.720 --> 15:47.690
Girlfriend, kid that died and
you want to see them again?

15:47.690 --> 15:48.885
(Faust stammering)

15:48.885 --> 15:49.810
(Mephistopheles scoffing)

15:49.810 --> 15:52.210
If you want my advice, you're better off

15:52.210 --> 15:54.793
with a shovel and nightly
access to a graveyard.

15:55.740 --> 15:59.823
And pay off a guard or
two, that usually works.

16:02.220 --> 16:06.130
Huh, do graveyards still have guards?

16:06.130 --> 16:07.230
I don't think so.

16:07.230 --> 16:10.354
Oh boy, I could tell you some stories.

16:10.354 --> 16:13.854
(Mephistopheles laughing)

16:15.380 --> 16:16.373
Where was I?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.500
Breaking into a graveyard.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.333
With a shovel?

16:22.333 --> 16:24.890
Right, you're better off
doing that than worrying about

16:24.890 --> 16:26.913
this necromancy bullshit.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.993
You can get into a graveyard,

16:31.688 --> 16:34.165
you can get your hands around a body.

16:34.165 --> 16:36.560
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

16:36.560 --> 16:37.757
You can loot 'em.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.580
You can fuck 'em.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.910
That's absolutely disgusting.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.740
Don't kinks-shame folks, it's impolite.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.563
I didn't mean any offense.

16:47.710 --> 16:48.943
Offense is taken.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.123
Not given.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.290
But nevermind that.

16:54.290 --> 16:57.410
Let's quit the foreplay and start fucking.

16:57.410 --> 16:59.483
We've got a transaction to make.

17:00.440 --> 17:05.156
Your soul for the ability
to perform necromancy.

17:05.156 --> 17:05.990
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

17:05.990 --> 17:10.423
Perform, you should get yourself
a crowd, do it on stage.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.690
Although that'd make for
a hell of a entertainment,

17:17.690 --> 17:19.089
that's not really the point.

17:19.930 --> 17:20.930
At least not for me.

17:22.119 --> 17:27.119
You see, I wanna make
the world a better place.

17:28.488 --> 17:31.988
(Mephistopheles laughing)

17:45.933 --> 17:48.253
I think you came to the wrong guy.

17:49.873 --> 17:50.880
You're the devil.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.013
So why'd you think I could
help you on your crusade?

17:56.392 --> 17:59.680
You wrote the book on it.
To cause chaos!

17:59.680 --> 18:02.190
Horror, mischief.

18:02.190 --> 18:05.403
I've got little patience
for men with noble motives.

18:06.750 --> 18:07.583
Why do you care?

18:07.583 --> 18:09.930
As long as you get your soul, right?

18:09.930 --> 18:10.763
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

18:10.763 --> 18:13.990
To the point, I like that.

18:13.990 --> 18:15.930
I'll get some bite out of you yet.

18:20.010 --> 18:22.080
You know, I don't entirely hate it

18:22.080 --> 18:23.793
that you got good intentions, kid.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.390
[Faust] Thank you?

18:27.390 --> 18:29.430
If I ever need somebody
to pave up the driveway

18:29.430 --> 18:33.327
by my house, you'll be the
first person I'll call.

18:33.327 --> 18:37.300
(Mephistopheles snickering)

18:37.300 --> 18:38.253
You a doctor?

18:40.080 --> 18:40.913
Yes.

18:42.670 --> 18:44.513
You ever seen a man die?

18:47.720 --> 18:48.553
Yes.

18:50.010 --> 18:51.750
You ever killed anybody?

18:51.750 --> 18:55.060
No, not on purpose.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.120
Well, that's where we're gonna start.

18:57.120 --> 18:57.953
What?

18:57.953 --> 18:59.403
You heard me, bitch.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.540
I'm sorry, I thought...

19:05.160 --> 19:07.410
Excuse me but I want to raise the dead.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.783
Well, somebody's got to kill them first.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.347
I'm sorry, I don't think I can.

19:13.347 --> 19:18.281
Listen here, now you're not
gonna be a cunt now are you?

19:18.281 --> 19:19.114
Are you?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.250
I wasn't planning on it.

19:23.992 --> 19:25.079
(Faust yelling)

19:25.079 --> 19:26.343
(sizzling)

19:26.343 --> 19:29.010
(Faust yelling)

19:29.980 --> 19:32.430
[Mephistopheles] You definitely
don't wanna do that now.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.710
I won't.

19:33.710 --> 19:35.890
[Mephistopheles] I just
sealed the deal in blood

19:36.860 --> 19:38.750
with magic.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.490
That's fairly obvious.

19:40.490 --> 19:42.223
Dark magic.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.900
Wow, and here I was thinking

19:45.900 --> 19:47.100
this was the kind of blood sacrifice

19:47.100 --> 19:50.196
one would describe as using
the good kind of magic.

19:50.196 --> 19:53.696
(Mephistopheles laughing)

19:57.264 --> 20:00.840
Now Faust, you're going to do everything

20:00.840 --> 20:02.942
that I say you're going to do.

20:02.942 --> 20:03.775
Exactly when and how I say it.

20:07.251 --> 20:10.560
I want you to follow my instructions

20:10.560 --> 20:13.060
no matter how difficult
to follow they might seem.

20:14.730 --> 20:18.583
If you don't, I'll torture the
everliving shit out of you.

20:18.583 --> 20:23.583
And ensure you die an
extremely slow and painful death.

20:26.650 --> 20:27.813
That seems reasonable.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.653
Well then, let's start.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.030
Lesson numero uno.

20:36.030 --> 20:38.010
You have to know how it is to take a life

20:38.010 --> 20:40.155
before you can bring anybody back.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.120
(dramatic music)

20:43.120 --> 20:46.642
And if I do this, I get
the powers that I seek?

20:46.642 --> 20:48.450
(Mephistopheles scoffing)

20:48.450 --> 20:50.253
When you get down to it, Faust,

20:51.430 --> 20:53.493
I don't care what your intentions are.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.050
What you want...

20:59.760 --> 21:01.023
It doesn't matter.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.560
What matters is that I get my
reward at the end of our deal.

21:07.986 --> 21:08.819
My soul?

21:10.880 --> 21:12.683
That's the idea.

21:15.020 --> 21:19.603
Three kills, one week,
that's your training.

21:21.599 --> 21:25.780
You don't deliver, you never
get to get your dick hard

21:25.780 --> 21:26.843
on raising the dead.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.163
And there will be hell to pay.

21:33.395 --> 21:36.062
(ghostly music)

21:52.519 --> 21:55.102
(door opening)

22:00.630 --> 22:03.317
(keys dropping)

22:03.317 --> 22:04.150
(Faust groaning)

22:04.150 --> 22:05.053
(water running)

22:05.053 --> 22:08.402
(Faust groaning)

22:08.402 --> 22:11.069
(ominous music)

23:46.347 --> 23:49.453
You can't do this, it's
been less than a week.

23:50.550 --> 23:51.630
You're not my mother.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.630
You went through a month's
supply in less than three days.

23:54.630 --> 23:57.650
No, he took them from me.

23:57.650 --> 24:01.170
Replaced them all with breath mints.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.293
I told you he was a bad guy.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.820
Do you have it?

24:05.820 --> 24:07.020
Do you have the money?

24:08.520 --> 24:10.003
I'll get it to you.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.503
No money, no deal.

24:16.450 --> 24:19.053
But I thought we were friends.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.640
Fine, but just this once.

24:41.299 --> 24:44.299
(Gretchen exhaling)

24:47.522 --> 24:50.272
(dramatic music)

24:55.601 --> 24:56.634
(Wagner sniffing)

24:56.634 --> 24:59.301
(ominous music)

25:15.738 --> 25:18.946
(Wagner scoffing)

25:18.946 --> 25:21.613
(ominous music)

27:36.187 --> 27:37.557
(footsteps approaching)

27:37.557 --> 27:40.390
(Wagner sniffing)

27:48.667 --> 27:51.500
(Wagner coughing)

28:01.294 --> 28:04.210
(Wagner whimpering)

28:04.210 --> 28:05.284
Help!

28:05.284 --> 28:08.284
(Wagner whimpering)

28:16.261 --> 28:17.741
(body blows landing)

28:17.741 --> 28:18.574
(bone breaking)

28:18.574 --> 28:19.591
(Wagner yelling)

28:19.591 --> 28:21.456
(body blows landing)

28:21.456 --> 28:24.456
(Wagner whimpering)

28:29.532 --> 28:31.283
Please, please don't kill me.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.920
[Faust] You're a worm.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.690
You can't do this.

28:35.690 --> 28:36.523
You're a doctor.

28:36.523 --> 28:38.490
Well, I guess this
gonna be the first time

28:38.490 --> 28:40.010
a doctor ever killed anybody then.

28:40.010 --> 28:43.363
Please, is this what
Gretchen would want?

28:44.900 --> 28:46.880
She doesn't know what she wants.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.713
And you do?

28:48.760 --> 28:51.653
I know her better
than she knows herself.

28:51.653 --> 28:55.310
(Wagner chuckling)

28:55.310 --> 28:57.200
She asks me to do things for her.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, I know how you poison her.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.943
Things she'd never ask you.

29:06.766 --> 29:09.460
(zipper sliding)

29:09.460 --> 29:10.710
It's in here.

29:20.580 --> 29:22.410
Thank you for doing this for me.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.810
I know it's a little gross.

29:24.810 --> 29:27.453
No problem, I assure you.

29:31.010 --> 29:32.203
It'll be my pleasure.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.181
What's that supposed to mean?

29:35.181 --> 29:38.098
(Wagner chuckling)

29:41.640 --> 29:44.480
She gave me blood and urine samples.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.710
And I passed them along to
an acquaintance of mine.

29:47.710 --> 29:48.740
Another one of your victims?

29:48.740 --> 29:50.750
Another one of my friends.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.053
Yeah, you have so many.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.853
She ran a variety of tests.

29:59.420 --> 30:00.533
Off the books.

30:02.570 --> 30:05.270
Don't worry, no written logs,

30:05.270 --> 30:08.343
no electronic records, no nothing.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.630
You know what I found?

30:11.630 --> 30:15.610
I found out, just like
your precious Gretchen did,

30:15.610 --> 30:17.963
as a consequence of her little hobby,

30:18.840 --> 30:23.840
it's entirely possible and to
be quite frank, fairly likely,

30:24.680 --> 30:29.680
that her heart could
literally explode at any time.

30:30.404 --> 30:34.020
(Wagner coughing)

30:34.020 --> 30:34.873
Explode?

30:36.430 --> 30:38.820
Pew, explode.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.273
But you already knew that.

30:41.120 --> 30:45.580
After all, you know her
better than she knows herself.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.480
[Faust] You poison people.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.053
And what's that in your hand?

30:53.140 --> 30:54.090
Cyanide

30:54.090 --> 30:57.100
(Wagner chuckling)

30:57.100 --> 30:59.178
You know, maybe you're not so bad--

30:59.178 --> 31:02.261
(body blows landing)

31:03.572 --> 31:05.590
You just bought yourself some time.

31:05.590 --> 31:07.493
A couple of hours at most.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.450
There's no way you're
gonna get away with this.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.650
What you gonna do, hmm?

31:17.650 --> 31:18.653
Call the cops?

31:20.338 --> 31:23.088
(Wagner yelling)

31:26.383 --> 31:29.580
(Wagner whimpering)

31:29.580 --> 31:30.427
So what?

31:30.427 --> 31:32.290
You're gonna rob me too?

31:32.290 --> 31:34.903
Nah, I'm not a thief.

31:36.350 --> 31:37.720
(phone dinging)

31:37.720 --> 31:40.653
I have no passion for those
baser human instincts.

31:42.460 --> 31:45.960
Sometimes, sometimes you
gotta break a few eggs

31:45.960 --> 31:46.923
to make an omelet.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.187
(phone dinging)

32:12.091 --> 32:15.091
(Gretchen retching)

32:31.121 --> 32:34.493
Enjoy your last day, asshole.

32:44.636 --> 32:48.454
(container bouncing)

32:48.454 --> 32:51.204
(dramatic music)

33:29.080 --> 33:30.940
Hey, Gretchen.
Hi.

33:30.940 --> 33:34.090
Your breath is minty fresh.

33:34.090 --> 33:35.810
Is everything okay?

33:35.810 --> 33:36.800
Tell my mother I love her.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.160
Excuse me, we're kinda
in the middle of something.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.057
[Actress] Okay, why can't
you tell her yourself?

33:46.306 --> 33:49.306
(Gretchen retching)

33:52.679 --> 33:54.429
I think that's why.

33:55.797 --> 33:58.746
(phone dinging)

33:58.746 --> 34:01.413
(phone dinging)

34:08.696 --> 34:11.362
(phone chiming)

34:15.396 --> 34:18.063
(phone dinging)

34:25.688 --> 34:28.356
(phone chiming)

34:31.331 --> 34:33.129
(phone dinging)

34:33.129 --> 34:35.879
(phone dropping)

34:46.681 --> 34:49.348
(phone dinging)

34:51.000 --> 34:52.040
[Actress] Oh my God, Gretchen.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.350
Gretchen, look at your phone!

34:53.350 --> 34:54.382
Look at your phone!

35:04.490 --> 35:07.150
Okay, supposed to be here any minute...

35:07.150 --> 35:08.330
No, hey, hey, hey.

35:08.330 --> 35:11.483
No sneak peeks, this is
for cast and crew only.

35:12.489 --> 35:14.290
I'm just here to see my girlfriend.

35:14.290 --> 35:15.980
Oh, Gretchen?

35:15.980 --> 35:16.900
Yeah, you know her?

35:16.900 --> 35:18.743
Oh, she's on the floor over there.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.690
Why is she on the floor?

35:21.690 --> 35:22.523
She dead.

35:26.964 --> 35:29.180
This must be some type
of sick joke or something.

35:29.180 --> 35:31.120
No, for real.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.393
She's dead.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.373
[Actor] I think she moved.

35:35.373 --> 35:36.960
She dead.
I think I saw her do it.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.793
[Actor] She definitely moved.

35:37.793 --> 35:39.330
Oh, oh, she alive now?
I could've swear I did.

35:39.330 --> 35:40.240
[Actor] Okay, she might be alive though.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.073
Oh, she alive?
She might be alive.

35:41.073 --> 35:42.060
[Actress] I think y'all
just like touching her.

35:42.060 --> 35:43.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, what?

35:43.150 --> 35:44.669
[Actor] Okay listen,
I'm gonna check the pulse.

35:44.669 --> 35:45.502
I'm gonna check the pulse.

35:45.502 --> 35:46.335
[Actress] Oh okay, touch her then,

35:46.335 --> 35:47.285
touch her then, touch her then.

35:47.285 --> 35:48.650
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:48.650 --> 35:50.221
You being a pussy, touch her!

35:50.221 --> 35:51.221
All right.

35:52.315 --> 35:54.117
(distant footsteps running)

35:54.117 --> 35:55.917
Oh no, she dead than a motherfucker.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.210
I killed her.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.243
(dramatic music)

36:12.243 --> 36:13.207
I killed her.

36:15.736 --> 36:17.153
I killed my girl.

36:19.301 --> 36:20.676
I killed my girl.

36:20.676 --> 36:22.759
Gretchen, oh my Gretchen.

36:25.619 --> 36:27.350
(Faust whimpering)

36:27.350 --> 36:30.363
Hey buddy, I'm sure that's not true.

36:32.005 --> 36:34.422
I killed her, I killed her.

36:38.273 --> 36:39.106
Gretchen.

36:41.758 --> 36:43.850
(Faust whimpering)

36:43.850 --> 36:46.120
Yeah but, uh, no, no.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.350
Like we saw her kill herself.

36:48.350 --> 36:50.320
There's no one else to blame.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.620
I killed her!

36:51.620 --> 36:53.117
All right, you got it, bro.

36:53.117 --> 36:55.867
(dramatic music)

36:57.756 --> 37:01.160
(Faust whimpering)

37:01.160 --> 37:03.800
Hey, maybe you should move aside.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.120
Wait until we get some
medical attention for her.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.453
Get a ambulance, a
stretcher, or a doctor, okay?

37:10.520 --> 37:11.830
Okay, let me move back.

37:14.430 --> 37:15.263
A doctor?

37:18.674 --> 37:21.841
A doctor, I am a doctor, I'm a doctor.

37:24.879 --> 37:27.624
I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor.

37:27.624 --> 37:29.115
It's okay.

37:29.115 --> 37:31.782
(Faust sobbing)

37:33.483 --> 37:34.316
I'm sorry.

37:40.340 --> 37:41.493
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

37:44.417 --> 37:45.738
I'm so sorry.

37:45.738 --> 37:48.488
(music swelling)

37:52.994 --> 37:56.603
Hey, you're that guy.

37:59.590 --> 38:03.163
Your girlfriend Gretchen,
she killed herself.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.453
That was crazy.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.223
Damn dude.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.950
Anyways, since I ran into you,

38:16.950 --> 38:20.363
I think you should know
that the play is tonight.

38:21.490 --> 38:24.804
We had to push the
premiere back (chuckles)

38:24.804 --> 38:27.830
after everything that happened.

38:27.830 --> 38:30.820
I thought we should go ahead
with what we had planned

38:30.820 --> 38:33.810
but with your dead
girlfriend on the floor,

38:33.810 --> 38:35.940
everyone else was against it.

38:35.940 --> 38:38.427
What's your opinion on the matter?

38:38.427 --> 38:41.737
(dramatic music)

38:41.737 --> 38:42.987
I don't care.

38:45.633 --> 38:50.633
I really don't give a fuck
about your stupid fucking play.

38:52.930 --> 38:53.763
Really?

38:54.612 --> 38:56.660
If you care so little about our play,

38:56.660 --> 38:59.753
then why were you at the
theater the other night?

39:01.863 --> 39:05.150
I was planning on bringing
my girlfriend some red roses.

39:06.883 --> 39:10.888
I knew she liked to visit
her friend when we...when we...

39:10.888 --> 39:13.112
Oh, but she was dead.

39:13.112 --> 39:15.569
White orchids, sympathy lilies

39:15.569 --> 39:18.326
would have been much more
appropriate for the occasion.

39:18.326 --> 39:19.660
I didn't know she was dead

39:19.660 --> 39:22.481
at the time I was at the boutique.

39:22.481 --> 39:26.207
I suppose that's a
reasonable position to have.

39:26.207 --> 39:28.717
But all that bullshit aside,

39:28.717 --> 39:31.116
you oughta know it's a pretty good play.

39:31.116 --> 39:34.492
(dramatic music)

39:34.492 --> 39:36.742
As I said, I do not care.

39:43.071 --> 39:45.241
It's people like you

39:45.241 --> 39:46.824
that makes me wanna

39:49.671 --> 39:52.024
makes me wanna kill myself.

39:52.024 --> 39:54.774
(dramatic music)

40:07.567 --> 40:09.470
Do you think that they'll get to us?

40:09.470 --> 40:10.303
We can run.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.440
[Emil] We can run, run, run.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.793
But we can never escape our destiny.

40:19.710 --> 40:22.900
I don't think we need to
worry about escaping destiny.

40:22.900 --> 40:25.873
For now, I'll settle for
just escaping the Nazis.

40:28.830 --> 40:31.480
You know, Emil, I don't
think this is the best way

40:31.480 --> 40:34.670
of dealing with the imminent
threat of the Gestapo.

40:34.670 --> 40:36.780
I think we should stay here.

40:36.780 --> 40:38.340
Just call it a night.

40:38.340 --> 40:39.173
And then what?

40:39.173 --> 40:40.543
What if things get worse?

40:41.490 --> 40:42.593
We'll burn that bridge
when we get there.

40:42.593 --> 40:44.950
That Nazis already
burned that bridge down.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.430
That's why we took the long way around.

40:46.430 --> 40:47.470
I'm not a coward, Claude.

40:47.470 --> 40:48.770
You're not de Gaulle either.

40:49.970 --> 40:53.823
If I die, I shall die as
someone who was true to himself.

40:55.570 --> 40:57.320
[Claude] Yes, but you'll be dead.

41:02.540 --> 41:03.463
[Emil] Yes.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.423
So, what do you suggest we do?

41:12.950 --> 41:14.930
Go home, go back to what we were doing.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.560
Ah, this is madness.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.393
No!

41:19.250 --> 41:20.750
This is Vichy France.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.868
We have to have faith in ourself, Claude.

41:22.868 --> 41:23.701
(hand slamming)

41:23.701 --> 41:25.790
Go back to doing what we were doing.

41:25.790 --> 41:28.040
Show those rat bastard
what we think of them.

41:28.980 --> 41:31.190
We shall continue to
write highly provocative

41:31.190 --> 41:33.270
satirical poetry about
the Vichy government

41:33.270 --> 41:34.137
and the Nazi regime in general.

41:34.137 --> 41:36.470
[Claude] Ah, they'll kill us.

41:36.470 --> 41:39.620
Not if our observations
are incisive and astute.

41:39.620 --> 41:40.550
They'll guillotine us.

41:40.550 --> 41:42.670
We're not dealing with
the Jacobins here, Claude.

41:42.670 --> 41:44.460
We're dealing with the Nazis.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.563
Nevertheless.

41:47.660 --> 41:48.750
Do you really think that'll work?

41:48.750 --> 41:49.603
Absolutely.

41:50.690 --> 41:54.181
The only thing that will
stop the Third Reich is love.

41:54.181 --> 41:57.181
(audience clapping)

42:04.856 --> 42:07.689
I hope you all enjoyed the show.

42:10.770 --> 42:15.470
I have a announcement and
a special surprise here.

42:15.470 --> 42:18.380
As you may know, our dearest friend,

42:18.380 --> 42:22.723
Gretchen killed herself
last week right here.

42:23.900 --> 42:27.203
That was the announcement,
onto the surprise.

42:28.160 --> 42:31.803
Her boyfriend is with us tonight.

42:33.630 --> 42:36.222
Come out here you handsome devil.

42:36.222 --> 42:37.055
(audience clapping)

42:37.055 --> 42:39.722
(ominous music)

42:42.390 --> 42:45.537
Thank you, thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, thank you.

42:46.680 --> 42:50.783
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
here to speak about something.

42:51.830 --> 42:54.730
Actually, I'm here to speak about someone.

42:55.970 --> 42:58.193
I'm here to speak about a murderer.

42:59.060 --> 43:02.290
Faust, come out here, you dog.

43:02.290 --> 43:04.957
(ominous music)

43:12.490 --> 43:14.040
This is the man who killed her.

43:15.250 --> 43:16.083
You're a rotten liar.

43:16.083 --> 43:16.916
Wait a minute, dude.

43:16.916 --> 43:18.649
I did hear you saying you killed her.

43:18.649 --> 43:20.303
No, no, I didn't kill her.

43:21.230 --> 43:24.470
Not directly, but I'm
indirectly responsible.

43:24.470 --> 43:25.590
That's what I meant.

43:26.764 --> 43:27.922
He killed her, dude.

43:27.922 --> 43:28.755
No.

43:28.755 --> 43:29.983
You killed her, dude.
No!

43:29.983 --> 43:31.120
[Audience] You killed her, dude.

43:31.120 --> 43:31.953
(clap, clap, clap)

43:31.953 --> 43:33.121
You killed her, dude.

43:33.121 --> 43:33.954
(clap, clap, clap)

43:33.954 --> 43:34.787
You killed her, dude.

43:34.787 --> 43:35.620
(clap, clap, clap)

43:35.620 --> 43:36.553
You killed her, dude.

43:36.553 --> 43:37.386
(clap, clap, clap)

43:37.386 --> 43:38.219
You killed her, dude.

43:38.219 --> 43:39.052
(clap, clap, clap)

43:39.052 --> 43:40.477
You killed her, dude. (clap, clap, clap)

43:40.477 --> 43:41.310
You killed her, dude.

43:41.310 --> 43:42.143
(clap, clap, clap)

43:42.143 --> 43:43.360
You killed her, dude. (clap, clap, clap)

43:43.360 --> 43:46.817
You killed her, dude,
you killed her, dude.

43:46.817 --> 43:49.567
(dramatic music)

43:56.792 --> 43:59.167
You killed her, dude,
you killed her, dude.

43:59.167 --> 44:01.217
You killed her, dude.

44:01.217 --> 44:02.283
You killed her, dude.

44:02.283 --> 44:03.624
(dramatic music)

44:03.624 --> 44:05.719
(Mephistopheles snickering)

44:05.719 --> 44:09.268
(footsteps running)

44:09.268 --> 44:12.018
(dramatic music)

44:13.810 --> 44:16.810
(footsteps running)

44:27.563 --> 44:30.980
(Faust exhaling sharply)

44:32.584 --> 44:36.084
Oh my God, Oh my God, what am I gonna do?

44:43.598 --> 44:45.119
You should be asking me.

44:45.119 --> 44:48.202
(fire crackling)

44:51.763 --> 44:53.313
What do you want?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.053
We had a deal.

44:58.190 --> 45:03.123
Well, I should probably inform
you that we don't anymore.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.935
Where the fuck are my bodies?

45:07.935 --> 45:10.435
(tense music)

45:14.183 --> 45:15.373
This was a mistake.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.066
This was all a mistake.

45:19.066 --> 45:21.816
(paper smacking)

45:23.860 --> 45:26.889
Where the fuck are my bodies?

45:26.889 --> 45:29.389
(tense music)

45:37.344 --> 45:38.447
I am not a violent man!

45:38.447 --> 45:40.230
It's a regular old murder.

45:40.230 --> 45:41.830
Not like anybody's getting hurt.

45:43.314 --> 45:48.010
No, no, you can't make me do this.

45:48.010 --> 45:49.305
We'll see about that.

45:49.305 --> 45:51.440
(body blows landing)

45:51.440 --> 45:54.158
I asked for three fucking corpses.

45:54.158 --> 45:56.782
You give me three fucking corpses.

45:56.782 --> 45:59.950
When I ask for three fucking corpses!

45:59.950 --> 46:03.033
Now what the fuck did I ask for, huh?

46:06.500 --> 46:07.713
Three corpses.

46:09.766 --> 46:12.273
I'm sorry, I can't kill anybody.

46:13.979 --> 46:16.173
[Mephistopheles] The
fuck are you talking about?

46:24.442 --> 46:25.633
I'm not a murderer.

46:27.048 --> 46:28.131
I'm a doctor.

46:30.933 --> 46:32.093
I don't get it.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.210
You're three feet away from home base

46:36.210 --> 46:38.420
and I'm trying to coach
you on how to get there.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.360
And you won't let me.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.660
It's not like I'm
starting you from scratch.

46:42.660 --> 46:44.360
What's that supposed to mean?

46:44.360 --> 46:45.200
You killed...

46:46.800 --> 46:47.633
What's her name?

46:47.633 --> 46:48.570
(finger snapping)

46:48.570 --> 46:49.810
Gretchen.

46:49.810 --> 46:51.580
I mean, that's one out
of the way right there.

46:51.580 --> 46:53.493
I didn't kill her.
Yes, you did.

46:54.620 --> 46:58.730
And as a matter of fact,
you got a two-for-one deal

46:58.730 --> 47:01.010
on that, you devious bastard.

47:01.010 --> 47:02.123
Good thinking.

47:06.460 --> 47:08.034
What?

47:08.034 --> 47:10.977
What are you talking about?

47:10.977 --> 47:12.113
You don't know?

47:16.150 --> 47:17.467
You don't know!

47:18.659 --> 47:21.522
(Mephistopheles laughing)

47:21.522 --> 47:22.772
You don't know.

47:25.995 --> 47:28.745
(dramatic music)

47:49.687 --> 47:51.386
She was pregnant?

47:51.386 --> 47:53.500
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

47:53.500 --> 47:54.523
[Mephistopheles] Yeah.

47:59.859 --> 48:01.590
So she died.

48:01.590 --> 48:02.423
Yup.

48:09.750 --> 48:12.950
So this wasn't planned?

48:12.950 --> 48:13.783
No!

48:14.800 --> 48:17.818
This was an accidental abortion?

48:17.818 --> 48:19.010
(Mephistopheles laughing)

48:19.010 --> 48:20.803
That's my favorite kind.

48:23.758 --> 48:26.675
(Faust whimpering)

48:29.110 --> 48:30.660
Oh my God.

48:30.660 --> 48:33.023
Don't get all drama
queen on me now, Faust.

48:33.971 --> 48:35.290
(ominous music)

48:35.290 --> 48:37.063
I mean, it's all just facts.

48:37.970 --> 48:42.020
She killed herself for a
reason and that reason was you.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.020
Take it back.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.193
I'm trying to give you a compliment.

48:46.280 --> 48:49.673
Take it back.
No, it's the truth.

48:51.390 --> 48:54.680
Although, I should point
out that, you know,

48:54.680 --> 48:58.090
given the fact that she had
to deal with you for years,

48:58.090 --> 49:01.340
I'm actually surprised she
held back on killing herself

49:01.340 --> 49:02.483
as long as she did.

49:03.480 --> 49:06.436
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

49:06.436 --> 49:09.519
(body blows landing)

49:20.000 --> 49:22.667
(Faust gasping)

49:36.660 --> 49:41.660
Now, I'm not the guy that
you should be getting mad at.

49:42.390 --> 49:45.057
(Faust gasping)

49:46.545 --> 49:49.212
(ominous music)

49:56.319 --> 50:00.713
I am not a killer.

50:02.136 --> 50:04.660
(Mephistopheles grunting)

50:04.660 --> 50:06.550
You killed two people.

50:06.550 --> 50:08.070
I just want one more.

50:08.070 --> 50:10.003
It's not an unreasonable request.

50:17.996 --> 50:20.746
(Faust grunting)

50:29.220 --> 50:33.423
I am not a killer.

50:34.500 --> 50:38.893
Jesus, now look,

50:40.630 --> 50:41.743
I understand that you think

50:41.743 --> 50:44.384
that this whole thing might be--

50:44.384 --> 50:47.263
(fingers snapping)

50:47.263 --> 50:49.150
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

50:49.150 --> 50:51.983
A terrible miscarriage of justice.

50:53.440 --> 50:58.370
But you, Faust, you decided to
pursue the art of necromancy.

50:59.490 --> 51:03.393
You decided to send me
that fateful fucking email.

51:04.850 --> 51:07.440
And you decided to kill Gretchen.

51:07.440 --> 51:12.440
No, no, I'm done with this.

51:13.560 --> 51:14.660
And I'm done with you.

51:14.660 --> 51:17.520
Bitch, you called me!

51:17.520 --> 51:19.200
You promised me a soul.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.940
You made a contract with your blood

51:20.940 --> 51:23.300
and you promised you weren't
gonna be a fucking cunt.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.670
And look now, here you are.

51:25.670 --> 51:27.900
Do you have any idea
how many people ask me

51:27.900 --> 51:31.190
for the same exact thing you did?

51:31.190 --> 51:33.830
Not even just favors they want from me.

51:33.830 --> 51:36.550
Do you know how many
doctors have reached out

51:36.550 --> 51:39.550
to me over the years to learn necromancy?

51:39.550 --> 51:43.354
For the express purpose of
making the world a better place.

51:43.354 --> 51:44.540
(Mephistopheles scoffing)

51:44.540 --> 51:45.520
How many?

51:45.520 --> 51:47.170
A fuck-ton.

51:47.170 --> 51:48.920
And most of 'em were a breeze.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.953
A pleasure to work with.

51:50.953 --> 51:52.990
Oh, but you.

51:52.990 --> 51:53.993
But you.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.083
Most folks wouldn't dare.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.763
But when cunts like you do,

52:02.330 --> 52:06.863
I crucify them and set their
still-dying bodies on fire!

52:08.751 --> 52:11.460
(Mephistopheles grunting)

52:11.460 --> 52:12.923
Do you take their souls?

52:14.720 --> 52:16.375
They are not worthy.

52:16.375 --> 52:18.504
(dramatic music)

52:18.504 --> 52:22.087
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

52:23.800 --> 52:26.690
I take my pride in my work, boy.

52:26.690 --> 52:29.313
I take a great fucking
deal of pride in it.

52:30.870 --> 52:34.000
But I've never taken a soul
unless I've earned one.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.986
And I've earned my fair
share time and time again.

52:36.986 --> 52:39.736
(dramatic music)

52:45.860 --> 52:49.100
If you had so many
students, how come none of 'em

52:49.100 --> 52:51.300
ever sought to make
the human race immortal

52:51.300 --> 52:53.680
or work to the extinction of death?

52:53.680 --> 52:55.450
Once they figure out
how to make themselves

52:55.450 --> 52:57.640
more than human, people don't wanna share

52:57.640 --> 52:59.750
that luxury with others.

52:59.750 --> 53:04.750
Their luxury only remains
a luxury if it's rare.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.474
What about their secret knowledge?

53:06.474 --> 53:08.720
(Mephistopheles laughing)

53:08.720 --> 53:11.920
I don't give a flying
fuck what they do with it.

53:11.920 --> 53:16.662
When immortality has
lost its new sheen and...

53:16.662 --> 53:17.495
Poof.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.453
They take it with them.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.585
That is the option they choose.

53:25.585 --> 53:28.223
Always.

53:28.223 --> 53:29.056
Always.

53:31.197 --> 53:32.030
Always.

53:36.970 --> 53:38.023
That won't be me.

53:39.060 --> 53:40.710
You won't get there.

53:40.710 --> 53:44.613
You die in this room, you die here now.

53:50.136 --> 53:51.053
I refuse.

53:52.249 --> 53:55.749
(Mephistopheles laughing)

53:57.927 --> 53:59.580
(Mephistopheles clapping)

53:59.580 --> 54:02.183
Not bad, not bad at all.

54:04.706 --> 54:07.153
I am a charmer.

54:09.580 --> 54:12.630
Now, let's chalk this
up as lesson number two.

54:12.630 --> 54:14.597
You're a pain in the ass
but I'm pretty hungry

54:14.597 --> 54:17.110
and I think we had a good talk.

54:17.110 --> 54:18.540
If we're gonna do this...

54:22.011 --> 54:22.844
You gotta know

54:25.430 --> 54:27.480
I'm doing this to save this rotten world.

54:29.930 --> 54:31.630
Not because you scare me.

54:31.630 --> 54:34.733
Aw, that hurts.

54:36.259 --> 54:39.342
(fire crackling)

54:40.841 --> 54:42.107
I don't scare you?

54:43.198 --> 54:47.450
My will is more powerful than
you could possibly imagine.

54:48.950 --> 54:50.450
Do your worst.

54:50.450 --> 54:53.420
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

54:53.420 --> 54:54.807
Happy to oblige.

54:56.855 --> 54:57.688
(skin tearing)

54:57.688 --> 54:58.671
(Faust yelling)

54:58.671 --> 54:59.784
(skin tearing and Faust yelling)

54:59.784 --> 55:00.617
(skin tearing)

55:00.617 --> 55:01.478
(Faust yelling)

55:01.478 --> 55:04.095
(skin tearing and Faust yelling)

55:04.095 --> 55:07.595
(Mephistopheles laughing)

55:16.305 --> 55:17.138
(skin tearing)

55:17.138 --> 55:18.945
(Faust screaming)

55:18.945 --> 55:21.695
(music swelling)

55:25.673 --> 55:26.506
(skin tearing)

55:26.506 --> 55:28.297
(Faust whimpering)

55:28.297 --> 55:31.047
(dramatic music)

55:40.488 --> 55:43.380
I hope you fucking burn in hell.

55:43.380 --> 55:45.130
Hell's got no circumference, kid.

55:49.344 --> 55:52.094
(dramatic music)

56:02.350 --> 56:05.350
(keys turning lock)

56:23.008 --> 56:24.091
(keys dropping)

56:41.540 --> 56:43.103
What's the time, kid?

56:53.610 --> 56:54.653
Five to midnight.

56:57.730 --> 56:59.380
Perfect.

56:59.380 --> 57:02.620
It's the best time for this
sort of thing, I tell ya.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.760
The witching hour's the bitching hour.

57:04.760 --> 57:06.313
That's what I always say.

57:07.820 --> 57:09.280
(Faust gagging)

57:09.280 --> 57:10.980
He's really dead.

57:10.980 --> 57:13.950
(Faust gagging)

57:13.950 --> 57:15.503
Let me check that for you.

57:18.206 --> 57:19.039
(smacking)

57:19.039 --> 57:21.073
Yeah, he looks pretty fucking dead to me.

57:31.141 --> 57:32.474
Abracadabra.

57:35.224 --> 57:36.391
Abracadabra.

57:40.030 --> 57:41.197
Abracadabra.

57:58.114 --> 57:59.281
Abracadabra!

58:00.795 --> 58:01.740
(water splashing)

58:01.740 --> 58:04.490
(Wagner gasping)

58:05.710 --> 58:07.724
What the fuck, dude?

58:07.724 --> 58:10.590
(Wagner gasping)

58:10.590 --> 58:11.473
You're the devil.

58:13.680 --> 58:16.277
No, I'm the devil.

58:17.120 --> 58:18.470
So what?

58:18.470 --> 58:20.530
You're gonna kill me too?

58:20.530 --> 58:22.733
No, he is.

58:25.181 --> 58:27.931
(Wagner gasping)

58:29.090 --> 58:30.923
But I just brought him back to life.

58:31.915 --> 58:35.102
You have to know what it's
like for that to mean nothing.

58:35.102 --> 58:37.852
(Wagner gasping)

58:57.289 --> 58:58.872
I'm sorry Wagner.

59:00.150 --> 59:01.093
No, you're not.

59:05.635 --> 59:06.802
No, I'm not.

59:09.492 --> 59:10.325
(skull smashing)

59:10.325 --> 59:11.158
(Wagner screaming)

59:11.158 --> 59:13.908
(skull smashing)

59:17.525 --> 59:20.192
(Faust panting)

59:24.524 --> 59:26.535
(door opening)

59:26.535 --> 59:29.285
(dramatic music)

59:37.307 --> 59:40.724
(shower curtain sliding)

59:41.700 --> 59:43.412
(shower running)

59:43.412 --> 59:46.162
(dramatic music)

01:00:16.475 --> 01:00:17.642
Abracadabra.

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:20.997
Abracadabra.

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:24.843
Abracadabra!

01:00:24.843 --> 01:00:27.593
(music swelling)

01:00:41.118 --> 01:00:44.285
(shower shutting off)

01:00:52.289 --> 01:00:53.456
Ebrah k'dabri.

01:00:56.232 --> 01:00:58.982
(dramatic music)

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:18.543
I'm sorry.

01:01:18.543 --> 01:01:20.252
I know everything that happened.

01:01:20.252 --> 01:01:21.085
Faust.

01:01:24.257 --> 01:01:28.077
If I knew what he was
doing, I would've stopped him.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:37.963
I'm sorry.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.560
I should be the one apologizing.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.283
Why, it's not like you're
the one who killed me.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.313
Yeah, I totally didn't kill you.

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:53.313
Wagner, that son of a bitch.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.383
Total son of a bitch, bitch of a son,

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.360
a son of a bitch of a son of a bitch.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.130
That motherfucker.

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.983
Total fucker of mothers.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.783
I wanna apologize for
the way I was before.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.233
I'm sorry.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.820
It's...

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.450
This can't go on, not after what happened.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:33.840
Gretchen.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.940
I can't go on.
Living?

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.793
Oh, no.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:42.832
I'm not gonna kill
myself again, I promise.

01:02:42.832 --> 01:02:43.860
(dramatic music)

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.360
Once is enough for a lifetime.

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.673
But then?
Thank you.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.160
Very much for resurrecting
me but this is goodbye.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.708
Gretchen!
At least for a while.

01:02:59.708 --> 01:03:02.458
(dramatic music)

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:04.683
(door closing)

01:03:04.683 --> 01:03:07.433
(dramatic music)

01:03:15.175 --> 01:03:18.258
(fire crackling)

01:03:24.632 --> 01:03:26.132
Tough luck, kid.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.953
Yeah, I know.

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:33.070
It's about to get tougher.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.085
No.

01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:34.960
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.330
No, no fucking way.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:40.080
We had a deal my friend.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.520
You do everything that I say you do.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.697
When I say you're going to.

01:03:43.697 --> 01:03:48.557
And you're gonna do it
exactly how I say it.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.320
This is not a charity.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.070
I don't do my job, I don't get my soul.

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:04.907
And when I don't get my soul--

01:04:05.996 --> 01:04:08.340
(Mephistopheles inhaling sharply)

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.593
I get hungry.

01:04:11.716 --> 01:04:13.810
(Mephistopheles inhaling sharply)

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:15.707
And when I get hungry--

01:04:15.707 --> 01:04:19.874
(Mephistopheles inhaling sharply)

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.343
Let's just say, I'm
not me when I'm hungry.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:29.803
I can't do this.

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:34.366
(Mephistopheles grunting)

01:04:38.922 --> 01:04:43.589
I might be the devil, but
I'm not a fucking communist!

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:49.123
I want my soul.

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.800
I could do everything else.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.200
I have done everything else.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.943
But, I can't do this.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.180
You told me earlier that
you wanted to make the world

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.370
a better place.

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:04.203
I do!

01:05:04.203 --> 01:05:05.720
Did you mean it?
Absolutely!

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.333
I don't think you did.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.280
I don't think you mean
half the things you said.

01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:15.220
I don't think--
Cut the shit!

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.590
I'm gonna get the pitchfork
again if that's what it takes.

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.870
I'm not afraid of
your fucking pitchfork.

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:20.680
Then you're a fool.
And I'm not afraid of you either!

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.430
Then you're a bigger
fucking idiot than I thought.

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:25.003
I didn't think it was possible.

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.759
But here we are.
Yeah, here we are.

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:33.140
(Mephistopheles chuckling)

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.533
What are you afraid of?

01:05:35.533 --> 01:05:38.200
(air whooshing)

01:05:47.998 --> 01:05:49.348
Dust.

01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:52.098
(dramatic music)

01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:46.631
(music swelling)

01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:08.264
(door knocking)

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.420
I said we couldn't do this,

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.167
at least for a while but I...

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:21.292
Are you all right?

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.600
Please sit down.

01:09:41.952 --> 01:09:44.285
I made a pact with somebody.

01:09:49.765 --> 01:09:52.098
I sold my soul to the devil.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:57.423
Don't you dare say what
I think you're going to.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.793
He's cruel, unfair.

01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:07.911
But if he gives me what I
need, at the end of this,

01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:10.240
I could end all human suffering.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.620
That ever was, that ever will be.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.943
[Gretchen] And what do
you have to do for that?

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:24.063
He likes to torture his students.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.463
Sounds like a lot of teachers I've had.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.493
What torture, Faust?

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:45.070
I have to kill you.

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.950
Jesus.

01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:48.670
But I could bring you back.

01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:50.160
Right away.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.230
It's wrong, this is all wrong.

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:54.483
And you know it.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.650
It's necessary.

01:10:57.650 --> 01:10:58.750
You'll get arrested.

01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:01.623
You'll be thrown in jail.

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:05.523
You will be punished.

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:10.940
The arc of the moral universe is long

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:13.710
but it bends towards justice.

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.830
Somebody has got to do the bending.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.760
We all want the same thing in the end.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.670
I don't want to fucking die.

01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:22.383
We both know that's not true.

01:11:25.924 --> 01:11:27.013
You absolute cunt.

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.810
(dramatic music)

01:11:34.644 --> 01:11:36.773
(zipper sliding)

01:11:36.773 --> 01:11:39.523
(dramatic music)

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:15.130
It's not personal.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.180
Why do you think he's having you kill

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.683
the one person you are
closer to than anyone else?

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:28.333
Please, stop.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:33.900
You don't have to do this.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.573
This is not who you are.

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.480
I sent the text.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:42.703
What?

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.393
I beat the shit out of
Wagner, I took his phone,

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.111
I thought it would help you.

01:12:50.111 --> 01:12:51.360
I thought it would be good for you.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.713
You thought wrong.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.810
I thought it'd make you stronger.

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:02.450
If you ever loved me.

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.283
I do!

01:13:04.455 --> 01:13:06.573
More than anything in the world.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.303
Not everything.

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.113
Most things maybe.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.433
But not everything.

01:13:18.773 --> 01:13:19.778
I'm sorry.

01:13:19.778 --> 01:13:22.528
(dramatic music)

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.493
But this?

01:13:27.893 --> 01:13:30.697
This is for the greater good.

01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:33.286
This is for the future.

01:13:33.286 --> 01:13:34.953
This is for mankind.

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:41.635
Liar.

01:13:41.635 --> 01:13:44.385
(dramatic music)

01:13:58.939 --> 01:14:00.124
I can help people now.

01:14:00.124 --> 01:14:03.910
You can help anybody
you goddamn want to.

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:05.683
But let me ask you a question, kid.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:07.853
Was it worth it?

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.120
The few who knew what might be learned

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.330
foolish enough to put
their whole heart on show

01:14:20.842 --> 01:14:22.370
and reveal their feelings
to the crowd below

01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:24.813
mankind has always crucified or burned.

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.730
I now know that there's no nobler cause

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.290
than that which possesses my heart.

01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:32.870
And what is that noble cause

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:35.193
which so dearly possesses your heart?

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.193
Life.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.923
Human life.

01:14:41.855 --> 01:14:45.840
What it once was, it'll never be again.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.740
And I'll make sure of that, I promise.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.900
And God help anybody that gets in my way.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.440
I knew a cunt like you once.

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:58.180
I remember he said to
me the exact same thing,

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.173
the exact same way.

01:15:01.687 --> 01:15:03.330
Would you like to know
what he ended up doing?

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:06.080
(dramatic music)

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.750
Are you sure?

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.850
I don't think you can handle it.

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:12.470
It's knowledge.

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:13.303
Not poison.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.350
He called it reason.

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:21.503
Only to pollute its use by
being brutaler than any brute.

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:26.390
That's not me.

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:29.340
Maybe you shouldn't
have shot me that email.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.560
Maybe you should've just
broken into some graveyards

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.540
and fucked some corpses.

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.633
It would've been much easier.

01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:41.643
I'm a necromancer, not a necrophiliac.

01:15:41.643 --> 01:15:44.490
(Mephistopheles chuckles)

01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:45.323
Hold on.

01:15:47.165 --> 01:15:48.665
You're not gonna take my soul?

01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:52.713
Well, my dear boy,

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.000
the devil's in the details.

01:15:57.528 --> 01:16:00.278
(dramatic music)

01:17:22.051 --> 01:17:24.801
(music swelling)

01:17:55.319 --> 01:17:58.319
(melancholic music)
