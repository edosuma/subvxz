12:31.636 --> 12:33.166
I saw her get some Green Light from

12:33.169 --> 12:34.908
one of them corner boys, and then, um...

12:34.911 --> 12:38.830
This gonna sound crazy,
but after she took it,

12:38.833 --> 12:41.600
for a second, it looked
like she caught on fire.

12:42.585 --> 12:44.552
What do you mean "caught on fire"?

12:44.554 --> 12:49.123
J, I mean, it looked like she was
on fire from inside her body, man.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.293
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's what I saw.

12:52.295 --> 12:54.929
Look, it only lasted a second,

12:54.931 --> 12:58.099
and after that, two men wearing black

12:58.102 --> 13:00.101
jumped out of this van
and they grabbed her.

13:00.103 --> 13:03.423
- Where did this happen?
- Uh, 34th and Oglethorpe.

13:03.426 --> 13:05.506
Okay, start over.

13:05.508 --> 13:08.532
Tell me exactly what happened.
Don't leave anything out.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.694
Heard you were dead.

13:26.696 --> 13:28.540
I was.

13:28.543 --> 13:30.013
Welcome back.

13:34.236 --> 13:37.070
I'm gonna need you to
front me two million in coke

13:37.073 --> 13:38.772
and $400,000 in chronic.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.475
Ever since Green Light hit,

13:41.477 --> 13:43.711
my business in Freeland has
shrunken to almost nothing,

13:43.713 --> 13:47.912
so believe me when I tell
you, your offer is tempting...

13:47.915 --> 13:50.117
- But?
- How do I know I can trust you?

13:50.119 --> 13:52.319
You disappear, then come
back wanting to do business

13:52.321 --> 13:54.421
in much larger quantities
than ever before,

13:54.423 --> 13:58.325
on commission, for a product
that people no longer buy.

13:58.327 --> 14:01.428
It sounds like a setup
and it feels like a setup.

14:01.430 --> 14:04.104
I'm not setting you up.
I just wanna do business.

14:04.107 --> 14:06.574
Like I said, all people
want is Green Light.

14:06.577 --> 14:09.177
They can't get it. One
supplier, and he's out.

14:09.195 --> 14:13.923
One thing I know is, folks
got to do something to get by.

14:17.580 --> 14:18.979
Yeah.

14:19.969 --> 14:22.483
That's a lot of product to
be selling on commission.

14:25.353 --> 14:26.834
What is that?

14:26.837 --> 14:28.722
My mother's address.

14:33.896 --> 14:36.485
You're putting up your
mother's life as collateral?

14:38.968 --> 14:41.435
How do I know it's really her address?

14:43.005 --> 14:44.939
Have your people check it out.

14:46.042 --> 14:47.474
I'll wait.

14:51.205 --> 14:54.048
It appears you returned from
the dead with a sense of purpose.

14:57.954 --> 15:00.487
As long as everything
checks out, we got a deal.

15:13.769 --> 15:16.370
You really gonna put your
moms up like that, man?

15:27.617 --> 15:28.916
[JENNIFER] Hey, Daddy.

15:30.086 --> 15:31.352
Morning.

15:31.354 --> 15:32.820
I heard voices earlier.

15:32.822 --> 15:34.054
Yeah, a friend came by.

15:34.056 --> 15:36.023
He had something to talk
about that couldn't wait.

15:36.025 --> 15:38.826
- I need you to stay home from school today.
- What? Why?

15:39.729 --> 15:41.929
I'm sorry. I can't
explain why right now.

15:41.931 --> 15:44.031
Dad, the results from the student
government race come in today.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.066
Yeah, I just need you to stay home.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.081
Hey. Morning.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.374
[JENNIFER] Dad wants me to
stay home from school today.

15:53.376 --> 15:57.044
Usually, parents have to beg their
kids to go to school, but not mine.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.214
Huh? What's going on?

16:01.037 --> 16:03.783
It may not be safe for
Jennifer to be out and about.

16:03.786 --> 16:05.552
Now, it might be nothing,

16:05.554 --> 16:08.222
but I'd like you to stay with
her until I can make sure.

16:08.224 --> 16:10.291
Does this have anything
to do with last night?

16:10.293 --> 16:12.059
I don't know.

16:13.395 --> 16:16.294
Look, I have to go. I'll
call you when I find out more.

16:16.297 --> 16:17.797
All right. Dad...

16:19.331 --> 16:20.831
be safe.

16:22.547 --> 16:23.746
Yeah.

16:28.644 --> 16:30.993
Excuse me? Have you
seen my friend, Neema?

16:30.996 --> 16:32.362
No, sorry.

16:38.821 --> 16:41.001
Excuse me, can I put this up?

16:42.291 --> 16:43.805
What is this?

16:43.808 --> 16:46.292
My friend, Neema, didn't
come home last night.

16:46.295 --> 16:48.052
Oh?

16:48.055 --> 16:50.531
I knew something was wrong
when she didn't call me.

16:50.533 --> 16:52.609
We talk, like, four
times a day, every day.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.079
And then her parents
called looking for her.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.715
Nobody knew where she was.

16:58.674 --> 17:01.830
- Maybe she ran away.
- Neema would never run away from me.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.132
Have you been to the police?

17:04.946 --> 17:06.213
What?

17:07.550 --> 17:09.049
She was on Green Light.

17:10.286 --> 17:12.920
So, the police don't think
it's worth their time?

17:15.391 --> 17:16.589
I'm sorry.

17:17.626 --> 17:19.173
I'll put your flier up.

17:19.175 --> 17:20.848
Thanks.

17:20.852 --> 17:22.429
[JENNIFER] This is all just too much.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.077
Being like this has
already ruined my life.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.465
[ANISSA] Are you... You
need to calm down. Seriously.

17:26.469 --> 17:29.203
Why is nobody listening to
me? I don't wanna have powers.

17:29.205 --> 17:31.438
I don't wanna save the world. Okay?

17:31.440 --> 17:32.973
Okay, I hear you,

17:32.975 --> 17:35.843
but you're rejecting something that
you don't fully understand, Jen.

17:35.845 --> 17:38.521
Like I told you, this is a
gift, a blessing from God.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.334
In your opinion.

17:40.337 --> 17:41.815
That doesn't make it the truth.

17:41.817 --> 17:43.354
What if it's a curse from the Devil?

17:43.357 --> 17:45.013
You don't even know what you can do.

17:45.016 --> 17:46.153
I mean, you could be out here...

17:46.155 --> 17:48.422
You know what, I don't want
to know. I don't want to know.

17:48.424 --> 17:49.890
- Oh, so, you're just gonna walk away?
- Yes.

17:49.892 --> 17:51.738
That's what you do when things
get tough, you walk away.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.540
Go ahead, quit.

17:54.330 --> 17:55.396

17:59.201 --> 18:00.534
It's real.

No, you have a responsibility
to help save people.

Okay, yep. You're right, you don't.

18:13.879 --> 18:15.416
And you know what, it's probably best

18:15.418 --> 18:16.750
that you don't find out what you can do

18:16.752 --> 18:18.185
because you just might quit.

18:18.187 --> 18:19.469
Just like you quit track.

18:19.472 --> 18:21.755
You'll probably quit on me, Mom,
and Dad when we need you the most.

18:21.757 --> 18:23.891
And let's not forget that
you quit on Khalil, too.

She'll keep her safe.

And you think those were the same kids

19:12.224 --> 19:14.155
that disappeared 30 years ago?

19:14.158 --> 19:15.458
Yeah, I do.

19:15.461 --> 19:16.998
And I think it's happening again.

19:17.001 --> 19:18.894
The ASA made Green Light to replicate

19:18.897 --> 19:20.936
the accident they made with the vaccine,

19:20.939 --> 19:22.742
but most of the people
that take Green Light,

19:22.745 --> 19:23.893
they don't develop powers.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.129
- They just destroy their lives.
- Yeah.

19:26.806 --> 19:28.644
You need to go see Gambi.

So, the pods Anissa described
would draw a huge amount of power.

19:38.879 --> 19:41.613
I might be able to use my
electric vision to find them.

Well, also, powered containers that big

someone seeing something.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.420
- Okay.
- I'll talk to Two-Bits,

19:49.423 --> 19:51.528
see if he knows anything
about the pods moving.

19:51.530 --> 19:54.331
[SCOFFS] Why would Two-Bits
know anything about the pods?

19:54.333 --> 19:57.701

20:03.209 --> 20:05.142
And what is electric vision?

20:05.145 --> 20:08.746
Well, I can see the current of
anything with an electrical signal.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.512
Huh. I didn't know you could do that.

I couldn't. I mean, I could
only feel electricity before,

39:59.416 --> 40:01.416
Lots of other memories.

40:01.418 --> 40:04.286
- Ghosts is more like it.
- Jen, this is not the time.

40:04.288 --> 40:07.489
You all get comfortable.
We'll be here a while.

40:16.266 --> 40:18.667
Ah, it should be safe here.

40:22.539 --> 40:25.641
Thank you for my latest addition.

40:32.216 --> 40:36.512
Have any more subjects
demonstrated abilities?

40:36.515 --> 40:38.285
No, not yet.

40:38.288 --> 40:40.555
I'm sure more will show up.

40:41.158 --> 40:43.156
Keep your eyes open,

40:43.159 --> 40:45.031
and do a better job.

40:47.164 --> 40:48.430
What do you mean?

40:48.432 --> 40:53.435
Jefferson Pierce is Black Lightning.

40:54.938 --> 40:56.138
What?

40:57.812 --> 40:59.441
Uh, no, he's not.

41:00.944 --> 41:03.712
He's been hiding in
plain sight all this time.

41:05.555 --> 41:07.255
Right under your nose.

41:10.454 --> 41:12.187
Why do you think he's Black Lightning?

41:12.189 --> 41:15.507
Because the second he was brought
in, there was a power failure,

41:15.510 --> 41:18.959
which allowed Peter Gambi
to murder two of my agents.

41:18.962 --> 41:20.362
It's him.

41:20.365 --> 41:24.701
You've worked very closely
with Pierce for several years.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.817
Do you think you can take him down?

41:31.375 --> 41:32.541
Yes.

41:33.852 --> 41:35.485
We'll see.
