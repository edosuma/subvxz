WEBVTT

00:03.269 --> 00:06.372
THOMAS:
This phase of our investigation
is a fact-finding mission.

00:06.374 --> 00:10.442
Why did you send Special
Agent Blye to Afghanistan?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.344
We've got trouble,
intruder alert.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.279
Who are they?
Don't let them in
until we know.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.514
NELL:
Department of Justice?

00:15.516 --> 00:18.150
This is an order
from the Executive Branch

00:18.152 --> 00:20.285
for a forensic audit
of this facility

00:20.287 --> 00:22.621
and all employees.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.391
DEEKS:
So, what are they looking for?

00:25.393 --> 00:28.794
Ammunition to bring down Hetty--
they need a sacrificial lamb.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.397
I will check in
with you every day.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.700
However, should I fail to do so,

00:34.702 --> 00:38.070
follow the enclosed directions
as soon as possible.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.807
Chauvenet is a Dark Net Deep
Web site that deals in billions

00:41.809 --> 00:43.642
of dollars of illegal
goods and services.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.644
That's Hetty's house.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.781
Somebody paid $250,000
to find out where Hetty lives.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.313
MAN:
Stop right there.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.483
Weapon on the ground.

01:31.224 --> 01:33.292
(groaning)

01:33.294 --> 01:37.296
(groaning)

02:21.407 --> 02:23.475
(TV playing indistinctly)

02:27.780 --> 02:30.849
(cell phone buzzes)

02:37.624 --> 02:40.159
Ugh. Stop kicking me.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.727
We're being called into Ops.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.928
What? What time is it?

02:42.930 --> 02:43.929
It's just after 6:00.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.631
In the morning?!

02:45.633 --> 02:47.900
Yeah, no.
I need my beauty sleep.

02:47.902 --> 02:49.735
More like a beauty coma.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.903
(groans)

02:50.905 --> 02:53.472
You're obviously not
a morning person.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.740
It's not morning, yet.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.608
Get up.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.278
God, I wish you had
a snooze button.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.588
(cell phone dings)

03:15.728 --> 03:17.796
(cell phone beeps)

03:25.838 --> 03:27.906
(cell phone buzzes)

03:31.511 --> 03:32.911
I'll call you.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.613
Mm-hmm.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.249
What's going on?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.951
Hit it.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.220
ERIC:
Last night a private security
guard shot an armed intruder.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.854
That's Hetty's house.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.389
You've been to
Hetty's house?

03:44.391 --> 03:46.225
ERIC:
The address was sold

03:46.227 --> 03:47.926
on the black market
Web site, Chauvenet.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.862
This is security cam footage
from her front parlor.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.464
That's Duke.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.865
ERIC: He was shot
by a second assailant.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.866
Both intruders got away.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.501
Ah, damn.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.337
What was he checking out
on the ground?

03:59.739 --> 04:01.807
SAM:
Zip ties and a syringe?

04:01.809 --> 04:04.009
That thing that looks like a bag
is probably a hood.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.312
Those intruders were there
to kidnap Hetty.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.647
Wait, so who's Duke?

04:08.649 --> 04:10.882
Hetty's security guard,
David "Duke" Fletcher,

04:10.884 --> 04:12.751
former British Special
Air Services.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.886
He's now in critical condition.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.856
No, he's worked for Hetty
for the past nine years,

04:17.858 --> 04:19.324
so she's probably
as close as it gets.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.492
Hetty did
give me this

04:20.494 --> 04:23.695
before she left
in case of an emergency.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.603
NELL:
In addition to her Hollywood
house that was just breached,

04:31.605 --> 04:36.708
Hetty also has an Encino
property, code name Briar Patch,

04:36.710 --> 04:40.879
a beach house in Venice,
code name Ancora,

04:40.881 --> 04:43.515
a loft downtown,
code name Callisto,

04:43.517 --> 04:47.586
and, of course, her boat,
Lady H, code name Sanctuary.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.621
Wow, I'd heard Hetty slept in
a different house every night.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.622
Thought it was Hetty lore.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.024
Now you know why.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.025
That's a classic Arafat move.

04:53.027 --> 04:54.359
Guess where he learned it.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.360
Bring up the addresses

04:55.362 --> 04:56.461
that were flagged on Chauvenet.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.065
Send us the addresses
for Ancora and Callisto.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.500
We'll check them out.
Already on it.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.468
CALLEN: Kensi, Deeks--
check out her boat.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.071
Where's Granger?

05:06.073 --> 05:08.307
Uh... sent him the alert.
He's not in, yet.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.976
Late night?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.545
Handling LAPD and Hetty's
nosey neighbors.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.781
Cops have agreed to sit
on things for 24 hours.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.516
Well, that doesn't give us
a lot of time.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.017
Well, we don't<i> have</i>
a lot of time.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.086
Special Investigator Wallace
and her minions will be back

05:21.088 --> 05:23.689
any minute to create
even more trouble.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.956
What'd they find at the house?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.059
Not much, maybe a boot print
in a flower bed.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.093
These guys are pros.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.828
Classic black bag job.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.063
The important thing is
they didn't capture Hetty.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.731
Who knows what they would
have done to her.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.099
I can think of a few ideas.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.735
We're gonna check out
the rest of her residences.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.736
All right, be careful.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.404
Let me know what you find.

05:43.609 --> 05:44.810
Yo.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.111
You okay?

05:46.113 --> 05:49.081
Yeah, I was just, uh, thinking
about what Deeks said.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.717
You know,
if Hetty had been home.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.118
She wasn't. If
she had been,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.986
it'd have been worse for
the guys who broke in.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.055
Yeah, maybe.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.991
Boot prints in
her flower beds?

05:59.993 --> 06:03.462
Someone steps on
her daffodils?

06:03.464 --> 06:04.896
She's probably
killed for less.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.567
Doesn't even look right
coming out of your mouth.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.568
They're prize winning.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.637
First of all,<i> why</i> do
you know that?

06:12.639 --> 06:14.439
We talk gardening
on occasion.
Gardening?

06:14.441 --> 06:18.009
Gardening, investment
strategies, woodworking.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.079
Just because the art of
conversation is lost on you...

06:21.081 --> 06:22.381
I can have
an artful conversation.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.582
Yeah, right.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.551
How's your vinyl collection
these days, huh?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.019
That was lame.
It's an icebreaker.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.087
Yeah, okay.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.122
It's a starter.

06:30.124 --> 06:32.591
Yeah, I'm warming up.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.699
Hetty has friends
in high places.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.167
Yeah.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.605
She's gonna need 'em.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.807
Do you have any idea
who's responsible for this?

06:48.809 --> 06:49.975
I don't know.

06:49.977 --> 06:53.011
She's also made
a lot of powerful enemies.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.579
Can I ask you,

06:54.581 --> 06:58.016
are you at all worried?

06:58.018 --> 06:59.584
I'm sorry.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.019
What?

07:01.021 --> 07:03.188
No, it's just that...

07:03.190 --> 07:07.192
Hetty always told me to remain
vigilant and cautious,

07:07.194 --> 07:10.662
but leave the worrying
to your enemies.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.431
That's good advice.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.667
Does she have any idea
any of this has happened?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.669
No, not yet.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.204
She should be briefed.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.439
I'll handle it.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.140
Okay.
What is it?

07:22.142 --> 07:25.076
Duke passed away
on the operating table.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.082
THOMAS:
<i>Miss Lange,</i>

07:31.084 --> 07:33.151
the mission in Afghanistan
was a debacle.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.621
The unsanctioned mission
that you approved

07:36.623 --> 07:42.027
to rescue one of your agents
totaled over $3 million.

07:42.029 --> 07:45.163
How do you justify
such a costly mission?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.232
(cell phone buzzes)

07:47.234 --> 07:49.167
Miss Lange?

07:53.539 --> 07:56.007
Miss Lange, the mission?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.010
Yes, I'm sorry.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.215
Could you repeat the question?

08:04.684 --> 08:08.253
You were about to defend
your egregious policy violation

08:08.255 --> 08:11.523
of negotiating with known
terrorist organizations

08:11.525 --> 08:14.559
using the funds of
the United States government.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.729
Some of the money was mine.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.733
Okay, and the rest of the money?

08:26.272 --> 08:29.674
The rest was funneled
through our operating budget.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.144
In other words,
the U.S. government's.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.225
No hospitals
reporting males

08:47.227 --> 08:48.760
with GSWs to the knee
and shoulder.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.028
They're too smart for that.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.863
Yeah.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.533
Where are Callen,
Hanna and Blye?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.067
Did you try the burn room?
Did you try the car pool?

08:59.005 --> 09:00.672
You two keep playing me,

09:00.674 --> 09:01.940
you're gonna
find yourself working

09:01.942 --> 09:03.775
in the IT department at Petco.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.145
Is there a problem here?

09:09.115 --> 09:12.250
I owe a report to Congressman
Thomas by tomorrow morning.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.219
Let me talk to
your people,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.821
or I'll shut your office
down immediately.

09:16.823 --> 09:20.625
Well, if you want to interview
someone, interview me.

09:22.795 --> 09:23.962
DEEKS:
Yeah, I could do this.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.630
I could handle living
on a yacht.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.965
On your salary?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.233
Maybe a rowboat.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.201
Not if I had
a shipmate.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.004
You'd need about 20 shipmates
to make this work, Gilligan.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.239
What about you?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.708
Nah, it's too rich
for my blood.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.843
I mean as a shipmate,
me and you.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.612
Split bills,
save some money.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.980
Maybe get a
cooler place.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.348
Are you serious?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.350
What? I'm non-smoking.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.819
I-I'm tidy, I'm
professional.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.254
I-I put my dishes
in the dishwasher.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.822
I buy toilet paper before
it's even necessary.

09:50.824 --> 09:55.260
I would live with Monty
before I'd live with you.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.828
Yeah, that goes
without saying,

09:56.830 --> 10:00.699
<i>I'm</i> saying that we
come as a package deal.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.767
Oh, so I get
a dog<i> and</i> a mutt?

10:02.769 --> 10:03.802
No, thank you.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.771
That's fine. It's
probably better this way.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.807
I couldn't put up with
your hoarding anyway.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.742
Okay, for the
thousandth time,

10:10.744 --> 10:12.077
I'm not a hoarder.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.613
Oh, you're a dirty
little hoarder.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.281
You're hoard city.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.350
This is messed up, G.

10:18.352 --> 10:19.818
If they can
get to Hetty...

10:19.820 --> 10:22.053
They can get
to any of us.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.002
Federal agents!

10:42.875 --> 10:44.709
Stop!

10:46.846 --> 10:48.046
(engine starting)

10:49.382 --> 10:51.383
(tires squealing)

11:00.693 --> 11:02.927
Drop that weapon on the ground!

11:02.929 --> 11:04.696
(grunts)

11:06.165 --> 11:07.265
G?!

11:07.267 --> 11:10.135
I'm good.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.071
We're clear back here.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.174
(clears throat)

11:25.017 --> 11:26.685
Eric?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.186
Yeah?
I'm sending you
a photo of the shooter

11:28.188 --> 11:29.788
as well as a number to trace.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.989
You got it.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.323
A find a blue Mustang
leaving Ancora.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.324
I'm on it.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.826
Henrietta Lange.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.194
All-powerful.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.962
I'm sorry?

11:37.964 --> 11:40.031
I thought we were doing
word association.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.366
Henrietta Lange

11:41.368 --> 11:43.301
has repeatedly acted
outside of her role

11:43.303 --> 11:47.172
as manager of operations for
the Office of Special Projects.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.874
And has twice threatened
to resign over it.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.444
Well, I threaten to resign
at least once a week.

11:52.446 --> 11:56.014
Doesn't that suggest
someone who's volatile?

11:56.016 --> 11:58.950
Potentially unfit
as a leader?

11:58.952 --> 12:01.753
Well, they're
not mutually exclusive.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.054
Churchill had a few

12:03.056 --> 12:05.990
volatile outbursts
here and there.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.093
If you're comparing Ms. Lange

12:08.095 --> 12:10.295
to Winston Churchill...

12:10.297 --> 12:11.429
Sounds like you are.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.100
Lauren Hunter.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.935
Before my time.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.770
Ms. Lange trained her

12:18.772 --> 12:21.372
well beyond NCIS protocol

12:21.374 --> 12:23.908
before she became an agent.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.745
The same with a woman
named Grace Stevens.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.147
Women mentoring women.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.784
I guess it's not all
competition and cat claws.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.053
Mentorship?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.988
Or indoctrination?

12:36.990 --> 12:40.358
I thought these questions
were supposed to be about me.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.026
What do you want me to say

12:42.028 --> 12:43.762
in my report?

12:43.764 --> 12:47.065
That Ms. Lange's
team won't comply?

12:47.067 --> 12:50.935
I can't help you
with your homework

12:50.937 --> 12:52.904
unless you ask me
questions that have to do

12:52.906 --> 12:54.472
with my role
as assistant director.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.141
THOMAS:
<i>Ms. Lange?</i>

12:56.143 --> 12:58.977
You have shown nothing
but a blatant disregard

12:58.979 --> 13:01.546
for your orders
from the Secretary of the Navy.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.115
I was operating well within

13:04.117 --> 13:06.117
the bounds of my authority.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.519
WOMAN:
If that were true,

13:07.521 --> 13:10.188
we wouldn't be here.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.091
I did what n...

13:14.093 --> 13:15.927
...need to.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.428
You disobeyed direct orders.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.867
Hetty, would you like
some water?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.068
Air!

13:28.274 --> 13:29.340
(all gasping)
Hetty?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.142
Hetty?

13:33.445 --> 13:35.947
We know at least
three people are involved.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.082
Two of which are
out of commission.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.084
But we still don't know who
they are or what they want.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.820
What they want is Hetty.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.521
Who they are
remains to be seen.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.156
The bigger question is
how did they get

13:45.158 --> 13:46.591
Hetty's personal information
in the first place?

13:46.593 --> 13:50.295
private people on the planet.
She's also one of the most

13:50.297 --> 13:52.096
skilled in tradecraft.
Exactly.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.098
So how the hell did her
information get compromised?

13:54.100 --> 13:55.433
She got burned by
someone in Washington

13:55.435 --> 13:57.268
like this Congressman Thomas.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.104
Maybe. I don't think
he's got the resources.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.172
Then who?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.474
Maybe we have a mole.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.211
Come on, Hetty vets
everyone on her team herself.
(door opens)

14:06.213 --> 14:07.612
How else would you explain this?
(door closes)

14:07.614 --> 14:08.847
Hey.

14:08.849 --> 14:12.016
Granger got a call
from Washington.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.186
Hetty collapsed
at her committee hearing.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.343
I hope you're pleased
with yourself.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.878
Where are you taking her?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.279
Madison General.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.616
(line ringing)

14:46.185 --> 14:48.119
What's going on?

14:48.121 --> 14:49.153
Still waiting
to hear something.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.155
Okay, got it.
Thanks.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.524
She's being rushed
to Madison General.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.659
What the hell happened?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.327
They couldn't
tell me.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.996
But I can try to find out
who's treating her.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.130
You think somebody got
to her in Washington?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.565
Nobody even knows she's there.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.967
Nobody knew her home addresses
last week either.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.435
I swear to God, if
somebody hurt Hetty...

15:04.437 --> 15:06.504
We need to be on the next
plane to Washington.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.605
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.140
We don't know
what's going on yet.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.575
Hetty's in trouble,
that's all I need.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.277
Maybe she just fainted.
She's under a lot of stress.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.012
Hetty? Fainted?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.179
Really?

15:15.181 --> 15:18.216
when she's being shot at.
Hetty did not faint.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.952
But Deeks is right.
We don't know what's going on.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.120
SAM:
I agree.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.289
We need to focus
on what we do know.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.390
And what's in front
of us right now.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.557
We don't have anything!

15:28.294 --> 15:29.694
What if we're wrong?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.195
And someone got to her

15:31.197 --> 15:32.964
while we're chasing our tails?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.632
Then we do what we do best.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.502
We rain hellfire down
on their sorry asses.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.070
ERIC:
Guys?

15:39.072 --> 15:42.473
Tell me you got
something on Hetty?
No, sorry.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.075
Facial rec had nothing
on your dead guy either.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.945
But I did get a hit on
that local number in his phone.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.713
Guy's name is Craig Lennox.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.682
He's a former
German national who runs

15:50.684 --> 15:51.683
a custom furniture shop.

15:51.685 --> 15:52.684
You got an address?

15:52.686 --> 15:53.685
Yeah, it's downtown

15:53.687 --> 15:55.153
off the Willow Street alley.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.055
All right, we'll check it out.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.224
If you need to go to Washington,
we can handle things here.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.427
No. Find out what
happened to Hetty.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.228
Eric send us the address.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.431
Did it. Let me know
when you get any news.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.333
Not bad.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.534
Can I help you?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.302
You just did.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.171
Glad I could be of service.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.140
Ah! You won't be needing this.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.276
And I'll take that.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.548
MAN:
Please state for the record
your official title

16:23.550 --> 16:24.749
and job responsibilities,

16:24.751 --> 16:27.318
Mr. Beale.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.187
I have to use the restroom.
You're not leaving that chair

16:29.189 --> 16:31.489
until you've told us everything.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.558
"Everything"?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.496
MAN:
We're here.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.304
This is the spot.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.173
No security cameras till
the end of the alley.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.408
You're certain?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.642
100%, ma'am.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.681
This'll do just fine.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.355
Thank you.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.736
CALLEN:
<i>This is a waste of time.</i>

17:18.738 --> 17:20.438
SAM:
<i>It's the only lead we've got.</i>

17:20.440 --> 17:22.540
Want to take
a walk around?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.709
Be my guest.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.312
I'm pretty sure
it's your turn.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.380
I'm not feeling it.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.182
(laughs):
So?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.551
So, it'll show
in my performance.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.786
In your performance?
Yeah.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.188
The key to undercover
work is authenticity.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.524
If I don't believe it,
nobody else will.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.559
And that can be dangerous.
Uh-huh.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.061
I think you're
watching too much

17:43.063 --> 17:45.363
of<i> Inside the Actor's Studio.</i>

17:46.498 --> 17:48.099
What's your favorite word?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.300
What terrifies you?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.235
You.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.570
(laughs)

17:52.572 --> 17:55.640
ERIC:
<i>I was caught</i>
<i>in a brutal crossfire.</i>

17:55.642 --> 17:57.675
Explosive rounds
were going off so near my head,

17:57.677 --> 17:59.310
I could barely see.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.779
But I kept my cool.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.315
I waited for them
to reload and the second

18:04.317 --> 18:06.350
they stopped shooting,

18:06.352 --> 18:09.720
I charged across that roof
towards sweet, sweet freedom.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.524
Until that bullet
tore into my neck.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.394
In a computer game.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.129
Not just "a computer game."

18:18.131 --> 18:20.298
I lost the '93

18:20.300 --> 18:23.101
Junior World Championship to...

18:23.103 --> 18:25.570
Oliver Pinkerton.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.740
Scheming Australian trickster.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.246
I felt like I let
everyone down, you know?

18:35.248 --> 18:36.581
Most of all me.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.282
Uh-huh.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.419
Now, when I'm helping
my team at NCIS,

18:41.421 --> 18:44.455
I compete against myself

18:44.457 --> 18:47.391
to see how fast
I can do my job.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.460
Find the unfindable.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.864
Hack the unhackable.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.866
"Unfindable.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.435
Unhackable."

18:57.437 --> 18:59.137
And then I'm not that scared

18:59.139 --> 19:01.639
little middle-schooler
again, you know?

19:01.641 --> 19:05.376
I guess I feel...

19:05.378 --> 19:07.845
empowered.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.221
I've never told
anyone that before.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.191
Thank you.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.671
Yo, G.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.239
The blue Mustang just pulled up.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.419
You're a hard man
to find, Agent Hanna.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.654
Are you kidding me?!

19:49.656 --> 19:51.355
I'm in the middle of a case!

19:51.357 --> 19:53.824
Well, so am I.
I'm on a stakeout.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.260
Then I suggest
we get back in the car

19:56.262 --> 19:57.328
before you blow your cover.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.629
Yeah. Let's do that.
Get in.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.565
Get in! Move over.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.491
What the hell are
you doing here?
I need

20:27.493 --> 20:30.294
to speak to both you
and Agent Callen.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.596
(laughs)

20:31.598 --> 20:33.431
You do realize now isn't
a good time, right?

20:33.433 --> 20:37.602
Unless you prefer
to go back to the office.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.339
(man speaking German)

20:43.408 --> 20:44.775
One of you guys the owner?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.244
Yeah. Can I help you?

20:46.246 --> 20:47.945
Yeah, I just got a, uh,
mid-century craftsman

20:47.947 --> 20:49.480
in Silver Lake that's
gonna need some work

20:49.482 --> 20:51.983
I'm right in the middle
of something.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.884
But if you call back,
leave your information...

20:53.886 --> 20:55.519
Can I just show you a photo?

20:55.521 --> 20:57.455
I said, I'm busy, man.
I know.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.724
I'm a Federal agent, man.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.661
They're running!

21:05.464 --> 21:07.031
And shooting!

21:09.501 --> 21:11.669
Shooter's heading your way, Sam.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.804
I got Lennox.
(tires screech)

21:13.806 --> 21:15.840
Buckle up. We're on it.

21:15.842 --> 21:19.343
(tires screech, engine revs)

21:26.351 --> 21:28.419
Lennox?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.421
Come out with your hands
where I can see them,

21:30.423 --> 21:32.857
you still may walk away
from this.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.462
(crashing nearby)
(both grunting)

21:59.618 --> 22:02.353
Sam, I got Lennox under control.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.388
Sam?

22:04.390 --> 22:07.058
SAM:
<i>You want to ask me questions?</i>
<i>Ask 'em.</i>

22:07.060 --> 22:08.693
What can you tell me
about Afghanistan?

22:10.562 --> 22:12.463
We were sent,
we located the enemy

22:12.465 --> 22:14.365
we rescued our agent.
Next question.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.368
I-I'd prefer you concentrate
on your driving.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.436
I am.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.670
Either ask a question
or get out.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.677
(horns honking)

22:26.679 --> 22:28.546
(tires squealing)

22:28.548 --> 22:30.414
SAM:
<i>You wanted to know what we do?</i>
<i>This is what we do.</i>

22:30.416 --> 22:32.483
Whoa. Whoa.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.855
WALLACE:
<i>Whoa-oa!</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:39.390
SAM:
<i>Any more questions?</i>

22:39.392 --> 22:40.925
Did Ms. Lange
provide you with funds

22:40.927 --> 22:42.593
to appease
the Taliban?

22:43.028 --> 22:43.894
Duck!

22:47.065 --> 22:48.499
Hetty used some of
her personal funds

22:48.501 --> 22:50.067
to help us
complete the mission

22:50.069 --> 22:51.669
and locate and rescue our agent.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.870
Shouldn't you be
writing this down?

22:55.607 --> 22:56.874
Oh!
Hold on!

23:07.486 --> 23:08.619
Damn it.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.087
Eric, run a facial rec

23:10.089 --> 23:11.756
on the traffic cam
at 4th and Molino.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.824
We lost him.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.872
ERIC:
I'm still searching
traffic cams,

23:27.874 --> 23:29.006
trying to see which way
our shooter went.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.975
CALLEN:
All right, thanks. Keep looking.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.076
Any news on Hetty?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.611
No, we're
still waiting.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.645
All right. Keep me in the loop.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.046
No, I understand that,

23:36.048 --> 23:38.115
but this is the
information I was given.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.019
Okay, well, please call
me if you do find her.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.522
Find her?

23:44.524 --> 23:45.990
(sighs)

23:45.992 --> 23:47.725
Madison General has no record

23:47.727 --> 23:49.093
of Hetty being admitted.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.494
Well, she probably
used an alias.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.663
No one matching
her description, either.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.999
(door closes)
Where's Lennox?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.534
He's in holding.
Where you been?

23:58.003 --> 24:00.871
So this is where
you've been hiding.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.873
I'm sorry,
this is a private club.

24:02.875 --> 24:03.974
I'm going to have
to ask you kids to leave.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.543
You must be Detective Deeks.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.544
DEEKS:
Deeks?

24:06.546 --> 24:07.778
No, he left.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.447
You literally just missed him
and his partner.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.081
Yeah. Actually, if we hurry up
we can still catch them.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.216
No one
leaves here

24:12.218 --> 24:14.919
until I'm finished
interviewing them.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.921
And I'll start
with you,

24:16.923 --> 24:18.055
Agent Callen.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.056
CALLEN:
I don't think so.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.057
We have a case.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.459
WALLACE:
I have a subpoena,

24:21.461 --> 24:22.460
which compels you to stay here

24:22.462 --> 24:23.594
and be interviewed.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.063
That authorizes me
to detain you,

24:26.065 --> 24:27.631
should you choose not to comply.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.233
CALLEN:
Then you better cuff me,

24:29.235 --> 24:30.901
because I'm not staying.

24:30.903 --> 24:31.969
You heard the man.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.037
Put him in
the other room.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.038
SAM:
You just don't know

24:34.040 --> 24:35.172
when to stop, do you?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.041
This is completely
ridiculous.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.210
No, this is serious, Ms. Blye.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.111
And since you people
refuse to realize that,

24:41.113 --> 24:42.613
you leave me no option.

24:45.617 --> 24:47.751
Get out of the way or get hurt.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.056
Don't go far,
Agent Hanna.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.791
I may have more
questions for you

24:53.793 --> 24:55.926
after I'm finished
with your partner.

24:58.129 --> 25:00.164
What about some coffee?

25:06.872 --> 25:08.939
(siren whoops)

25:17.883 --> 25:19.049
You won't be needing
that, Ms. Lange.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.218
If we wanted you dead,
you would be.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.153
What do you want?

25:23.155 --> 25:24.021
We'd like you to come with us.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.022
HETTY:
Why?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.690
Who are you?

25:28.093 --> 25:29.527
This way, please.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.911
Son of a bitch!

25:46.913 --> 25:48.979
(seagulls squawking)

25:52.150 --> 25:54.752
(chuckles)

25:54.754 --> 25:57.655
How was
your swim?

25:57.657 --> 25:59.723
Surprisingly
refreshing.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.027
I should have thrown that lady
out when I had the chance.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.663
Yeah? So why didn't you?

26:05.665 --> 26:07.831
I mean, I usually like a woman

26:07.833 --> 26:09.266
that wants to put me
in handcuffs, but...

26:09.268 --> 26:10.801
not that one.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.269
Oh, no, no.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.737
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.105
Did you hear what
you just said?

26:15.107 --> 26:16.340
What?

26:16.342 --> 26:18.842
Sounded like something
Deeks would say.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.211
Oh, God, you're right.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.114
Think I held my breath
underwater too long?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.216
What's the blast radius
of a nuclear weapon

26:26.218 --> 26:28.852
with a ten-kiloton yield
detonated at ground level?

26:28.854 --> 26:30.721
I like cheese.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.189
You're fine.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.092
Look...

26:35.094 --> 26:36.760
if this whole thing

26:36.762 --> 26:39.163
is about somebody wanting
to get to Hetty...

26:39.165 --> 26:41.065
maybe it's time
we just hand her over.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.835
So you guys twins? Huh?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.870
My friend, uh,
Darrel Dinkins

26:46.872 --> 26:48.906
had a twin--
unborn twin, actually--

26:48.908 --> 26:50.841
in his armpit.
It wasn't, like, a full twin,

26:50.843 --> 26:52.843
it was just like a big cyst
but it had teeth

26:52.845 --> 26:55.145
and hair and...
Do you ever shut up?

26:55.147 --> 26:57.081
What are you talking about, man?
I'm just trying to make
conversation, here.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.882
You know what I mean?
I'm trying to interact.
(phone buzzes)

26:58.884 --> 26:59.883
This guy, huh?

26:59.885 --> 27:01.218
Obviously
the grumpy twin.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.754
I have to get back to Ops.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.823
Fine. Go.

27:07.892 --> 27:10.094
(clears throat)
I have to get back to Ops.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.729
To...

27:11.731 --> 27:13.297
Nope. Gonna...

27:13.299 --> 27:14.698
just gonna sit here.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.767
This okay?
Just back down...

27:16.769 --> 27:18.202
Oh!

27:18.204 --> 27:19.203
So we're doing this, huh?

27:19.205 --> 27:20.270
What do you guys do for fun?

27:20.272 --> 27:22.339
Tweedledee
and Tweedledum?

27:24.075 --> 27:26.143
WALLACE:
Let's go back to the beginning.

27:28.013 --> 27:30.047
Who was Jack Simon?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.682
He was a Marine.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.684
A Marine you
were engaged to?

27:33.686 --> 27:34.818
Mm-hmm.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.186
A long time ago.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.788
The CIA believes

27:37.790 --> 27:39.757
Jack Simon was
the White Ghost--

27:39.759 --> 27:43.727
a Western civilian
helping the Taliban.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.195
We all know how accurate

27:45.197 --> 27:47.398
the CIA intel is, don't we?

27:49.801 --> 27:52.903
Was your fiancé the White Ghost?

27:54.739 --> 27:57.241
There was no White Ghost.

27:59.110 --> 28:02.146
So you went halfway
around the world

28:02.148 --> 28:05.949
for several months
chasing misinformation?

28:07.886 --> 28:08.919
Looks that way.

28:10.388 --> 28:12.022
During which time,

28:12.024 --> 28:15.092
you were kidnapped
by the Taliban.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.428
How'd that happen?

28:23.735 --> 28:25.302
What do you mean,
how did that happen?

28:28.006 --> 28:32.309
Why were you off the forward
operating base alone?

28:32.311 --> 28:34.445
I was following a lead.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.114
In hostile territory,
by yourself,

28:37.116 --> 28:39.416
without telling anyone
where you were going

28:39.418 --> 28:41.485
and what you were doing?

28:43.021 --> 28:44.354
That's stupid

28:44.356 --> 28:47.491
or intentional.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.027
Either way, it cost
the taxpayers

28:50.029 --> 28:53.097
several million dollars
for the operation

28:53.099 --> 28:54.898
to get you back,

28:54.900 --> 28:57.201
including $1 million in cash

28:57.203 --> 28:58.902
that was paid to your captors,

28:58.904 --> 29:01.004
and that seems extraordinary,

29:01.006 --> 29:02.873
considering it's been
this government's policy

29:02.875 --> 29:06.009
that we don't negotiate
with terrorists.

29:07.445 --> 29:10.047
Do you have
any idea

29:10.049 --> 29:13.784
how many
guns, bombs,

29:13.786 --> 29:17.254
U.S. deaths that
money will finance?

29:17.256 --> 29:18.789
Do you have any idea

29:18.791 --> 29:20.991
what I went through
in captivity?

29:50.822 --> 29:52.890
♪ ♪

29:56.361 --> 29:57.928
(door buzzes)

30:03.968 --> 30:04.968
Think they bought it?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.905
It's hard to say.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.973
My guess is they
watch all of her houses.

30:11.342 --> 30:12.876
All right, where do you want me?

30:12.878 --> 30:14.511
Upstairs.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.180
Hopefully Kensi and Deeks
will be free of Wallace

30:16.182 --> 30:17.915
before we get
any company.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.286
DEEKS:
Oh, it's about time.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.321
They're done!

30:24.323 --> 30:27.357
Hey, did you finish
your book report?

30:27.359 --> 30:29.293
All right, my turn.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.828
WALLACE:
We're done for now.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.095
We'll be in touch.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.031
Oh...

30:34.033 --> 30:35.265
You're missing out,

30:35.267 --> 30:36.967
'cause I know where
the bodies are buried.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.436
I also know the Colonel's
11 herbs and spices.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.505
That's right, secret recipe.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.873
See you later.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.309
You okay?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.377
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

30:48.880 --> 30:51.415
I don't know, what'd
they ask you about?

30:51.417 --> 30:54.418
Um... just Hetty.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.454
Uh... Afghanistan.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.124
You want to talk about it?

31:02.093 --> 31:04.127
Nope.

31:06.564 --> 31:09.299
I always find that it helps me
when I talk about the...

31:09.301 --> 31:11.301
things that are bothering me.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.603
That's funny, 'cause, um...

31:14.105 --> 31:17.074
...it never helps when
you're bothering me.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.308
(laughs)

31:18.310 --> 31:20.377
Touché.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.449
Except I'm being serious.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.887
Come on, partners
don't keep secrets.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.192
Partners?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.029
I mean,
that's what we are, right?

31:39.031 --> 31:40.097
We're partners.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.132
Come on.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.133
Low five.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.002
Hit me.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.069
Don't leave
me hanging.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.640
You didn't really
even connect.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.074
You gotta make
good contact,

31:51.076 --> 31:52.643
otherwise it
doesn't count.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.047
Oh, my God.
Come here.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.153
It's okay.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.292
(crying):
I just want to forget
what happened.

32:11.963 --> 32:13.563
I know you do.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.233
I know you do,
but you can't.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.535
And the harder you try,

32:18.537 --> 32:20.604
the harder it's just gonna
fight back, trust me.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.409
You just gotta
let it out.

32:27.145 --> 32:30.013
You gotta make
peace with it.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.519
But that takes time.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.587
(sniffs)

32:40.124 --> 32:41.391
I'm so much tougher than this.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.559
I know you are.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.161
You're tougher than me,
and that's tough.

32:48.399 --> 32:50.701
Even with this...

32:50.703 --> 32:55.138
adorable... veneer.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.174
(laughs)

32:57.176 --> 33:00.077
My God. And just like that...

33:00.079 --> 33:02.746
the moment is way gone.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.414
That's okay.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.217
I got more moments.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.318
Okay.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.673
All locked up.
Any movement?

33:29.675 --> 33:31.675
No. But I think
one of us should leave.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.477
They're gonna assume
Hetty has security,

33:33.479 --> 33:36.580
to move a move if they think
there's only one of us.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.648
Keep your eyes open.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.219
I'm glad you're having fun.
Uh-huh.

33:49.093 --> 33:51.161
(car door opens)

33:53.431 --> 33:55.499
Follow me, please.

34:04.475 --> 34:06.543
(elevator bell dings)

34:20.491 --> 34:22.559
Wait here, please.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.378
MAN:
I'm glad to see you've made
such a speedy recovery.

34:45.716 --> 34:48.819
I hope you have a
damn good explanation

34:48.821 --> 34:51.655
for this, Leon.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.156
It's nice to see you, too,

34:53.158 --> 34:55.225
Henrietta.

34:59.664 --> 35:03.500
What's the meaning of all this?

35:05.336 --> 35:07.204
You've got a leak
in your operation.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.206
Oh, the hell I do.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.242
Your personal information
was sold online.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.344
Information that wasn't
even available to us.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.646
How long have you known this?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.415
Long enough.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.784
Long enough to
have informed me?

35:20.786 --> 35:22.385
Doing so

35:22.387 --> 35:24.821
could've tipped off the people
who are behind this.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.624
So, you used me?

35:27.626 --> 35:28.825
I protected you.

35:28.827 --> 35:29.860
Still am.

35:29.862 --> 35:32.162
And the hearing?

35:32.164 --> 35:34.731
Thomas has an axe to grind.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.900
Always looking to make
a name for himself.

35:36.902 --> 35:40.570
So, it wasn't that hard to push
him in the right direction.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.440
You set him on me?

35:43.442 --> 35:45.542
It was the only way
I could ensure

35:45.544 --> 35:47.477
that you would leave
Los Angeles.

35:48.679 --> 35:50.747
(laughs)

35:53.384 --> 35:55.819
Oh, well played, Leon.

35:58.456 --> 36:01.158
I had a good teacher.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.425
But...

36:02.427 --> 36:04.661
by protecting me,

36:04.663 --> 36:08.532
you put my people in
even greater danger.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.634
It's been my experience
that your team

36:10.636 --> 36:13.803
can take care of themselves.

36:13.805 --> 36:17.440
I still don't like this.

36:17.442 --> 36:18.675
Nobody does.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.912
So, what's next?

36:21.914 --> 36:23.813
You remain here in D.C.

36:23.815 --> 36:26.917
protected until we find
those responsible.

36:26.919 --> 36:30.754
What other options do I have?

36:30.756 --> 36:32.189
You don't have any.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.191
I can't protect you

36:34.193 --> 36:36.259
outside of my chain of command.

36:37.595 --> 36:40.664
Is that why you brought me here?

36:40.666 --> 36:44.701
To tell me that
I'm a dinosaur?

36:46.470 --> 36:50.273
I just like the museum.

36:53.477 --> 36:54.778
(tires screeching)

36:54.780 --> 36:56.746
Here we go!

36:59.684 --> 37:01.751
Could use a hand, G.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.553
NELL:
I count

37:03.555 --> 37:04.754
three coming in the front.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.825
<i>Two more headed around back.</i>

37:25.876 --> 37:27.444
MAN:
Upstairs.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.551
(tires screech)

37:36.921 --> 37:38.755
CALLEN:
Nell, status?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.457
I'm holding the high ground.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.993
Copy. Kensi and Deeks
are five minutes out.

37:42.995 --> 37:44.794
(cell phone buzzing)

37:51.836 --> 37:53.837
(door closes)

37:53.839 --> 37:55.805
HETTY:
Nell?

37:55.807 --> 37:57.841
What's going on?

37:57.843 --> 37:58.942
We're under attack.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.910
Where?
Dovecote.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.712
You're in my house?!

38:02.714 --> 38:04.547
Yes, and we're
outmanned and outgunned.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.383
Oh, bugger.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.852
Listen to me carefully.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.789
(grunts)

38:15.593 --> 38:17.927
(grunts)

38:33.311 --> 38:34.778
They came for Hetty

38:34.780 --> 38:36.880
at night with sedatives
and syringes.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.415
These guys aren't here
to kidnap anyone.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.850
(gunfire)

38:40.852 --> 38:41.951
They're here to kill us.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.421
(gunfire upstairs)

38:44.423 --> 38:45.822
Nell!

38:49.927 --> 38:51.461
(grunts)

39:05.876 --> 39:07.110
Nell?!

39:07.112 --> 39:08.845
Go! I got these jokers!

39:08.847 --> 39:09.879
Go!

39:09.881 --> 39:11.548
Nell?

39:13.818 --> 39:15.885
You okay?
Yeah.

39:17.788 --> 39:18.855
Follow me.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.924
(gunfire continues)

39:22.727 --> 39:24.594
Nell, this is a dead end!

39:27.498 --> 39:28.531
Nell!

39:32.036 --> 39:34.771
Of course Hetty has
a secret passageway.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.374
Who do you think put
the trapdoor in the boatshed?

39:37.376 --> 39:38.742
Sam!

39:40.845 --> 39:42.379
(clock chimes)

39:53.758 --> 39:56.526
I love Hetty.

39:56.528 --> 39:59.028
I just wish she wasn't so small.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.731
(sirens wailing)

40:04.635 --> 40:06.636
(helicopter blades whirring)

40:06.638 --> 40:08.638
(indistinct shouts)

40:11.876 --> 40:13.042
Federal agents!

40:14.545 --> 40:15.779
Don't even think about it.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.147
I have had a terrible
day already.

40:18.883 --> 40:20.583
Down!

40:20.585 --> 40:22.018
DEEKS: All the way.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.756
How are we gonna
explain this to Hetty?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.825
We're not. I'm sure
you'll think of something.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.460
Oh, I get it.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.694
You get to have
artful conversations

40:31.696 --> 40:32.862
about, uh,
butterflies and flowers

40:32.864 --> 40:34.197
and I get to give her
the bad news?

40:34.199 --> 40:35.899
It works for me.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.500
Uh-huh.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.440
(door opens)

40:43.442 --> 40:45.508
(door closes)

40:46.877 --> 40:49.879
Just got word that
Hetty's fine.

40:49.881 --> 40:50.880
What was it?

40:50.882 --> 40:53.483
Exhaustion.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.818
So, who the hell are they?

40:54.820 --> 40:57.220
And they're not talking.
Eric's looking

40:57.222 --> 40:58.955
at their biometrics.
Who's the suit?

40:58.957 --> 41:00.590
Their lawyer.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.492
Guy came before
we could take them away.

41:02.494 --> 41:05.795
Interesting.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.063
Where is everybody?

41:07.065 --> 41:10.233
Kensi and Deeks took Nell home.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.734
She okay?

41:13.037 --> 41:15.038
She's never killed
anyone before.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.074
It was him or her.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.109
SAM: Doesn't make
it any easier.

41:23.647 --> 41:24.948
Keep an eye on her.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.049
Let me know
if there's a problem.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.951
She'll be okay.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.922
Hey, I've got positive I.D.'s
on one of the men

41:32.924 --> 41:34.958
you arrested
and one of the deceased.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.125
I'm still working on the rest.

41:36.127 --> 41:37.594
Elias Bauer

41:37.596 --> 41:38.828
and Fabian Schneider.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.029
They both came in
three weeks ago

41:40.031 --> 41:42.932
on legit EU passports
issued by Germany.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.969
What do the Germans
have against Hetty?

41:45.971 --> 41:48.104
Could be guns for hire.
They were both

41:48.106 --> 41:50.773
on a Lufthansa flight
from Frankfurt via Toronto.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.742
I decided to check LAX security

41:52.744 --> 41:55.044
to see if any of the others
were on that flight.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.546
And?
No.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.181
But...

41:58.183 --> 42:00.049
I did find this.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.656
Mattias.

42:06.658 --> 42:10.260
Why would Mattias
come after Hetty now?

42:10.262 --> 42:13.162
With Hetty's personal
information for sale,

42:13.164 --> 42:16.833
He probably thought he could
go in quietly and grab her.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.168
We warned him what would happen

42:19.170 --> 42:22.038
if he ever tried
to hurt her again.

42:26.010 --> 42:28.545
So, what do we do now?

42:28.547 --> 42:31.180
We make good
on our promise.

42:32.716 --> 42:35.752
We hunt him down...

42:35.754 --> 42:37.720
and we kill him.
