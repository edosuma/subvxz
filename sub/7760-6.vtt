00:10.144 --> 00:11.512
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.545 --> 00:13.247
* ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:13.281 --> 00:14.282
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:14.315 --> 00:20.288
*

00:28.596 --> 00:29.730
* ONE, TWO, DO IT

00:29.763 --> 00:32.400

00:32.433 --> 00:33.467
* ONE, TWO, THREE

00:33.501 --> 00:35.303
- * FOUR, FOUR

00:35.336 --> 00:38.439
*

01:38.232 --> 01:40.268
- SO THERE I WAS,
STARK NAKED,

01:40.301 --> 01:43.371
FREEZING MY TAIL OFF,
SPYING ON BEN.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.406
- WAS HE PLUCKING
HIS MAGIC TWANGER?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.807
- NO, HE HAD A NEEDLE,

01:46.840 --> 01:50.244
AND HE WAS GIVING HIMSELF
A SHOT IN THE ASS.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.880
- THE NUTTY PROFESSOR,
A JUICE PIG?

01:52.913 --> 01:55.216
I AM SO TURNED ON.
HERE, FEEL.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.750
[laughs]
- CUT IT OUT.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.752
I'VE SEEN HIM DO IT TWICE.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.488
I THINK
HE'S DOING STEROIDS.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.889
- FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND

02:01.922 --> 02:03.491
WHY SO MANY GAY MEN
WANT TO FUCK THEIR BODIES UP

02:03.524 --> 02:05.226
WITH DRUGS.
- HE'S ALWAYS AT THE GYM,

02:05.259 --> 02:07.295
HE HAS THESE NASTY MOODS.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.230
- 'ROID RAGE.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.565
WELL, CONSIDER IT
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

02:11.599 --> 02:13.167
FOR AN AMAZING BODY.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.635
- YOU'RE A BIG FUCKING HELP.
- HI, GUYS!

02:14.668 --> 02:16.237
- SO HOW ARE
THE TWO LOVE BIRDS?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.172
- UH, FREEZING OUR TITS OFF.
- YEAH, WELL,

02:18.206 --> 02:20.508
AT LEAST I WON'T HAVE TO PINCH
MY NIPS TO GET THEM ALL TAUT.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.642
- ALLOW ME.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.444
- OW, GOD!

02:23.477 --> 02:25.246
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THE LINE
TO GET INTO THIS FUCKING DUMP?

02:25.279 --> 02:27.281
- YEAH, IT'S ON ACCOUNT
OF THOSE GUYS WHO OD'D.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.649
- GREAT, SO BECAUSE
SOME IGNORANT AMATEURS

02:28.682 --> 02:29.850
DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING,

02:29.883 --> 02:31.419
THE REST OF US
SHOULD GET PUNISHED.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.955
- YEAH, YOU CAN THANK
YOUR FRIEND, THE CHIEF.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.791
- LET'S GO INSIDE
BEFORE MY DICK GETS FROSTBITE.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.793
- YOU HAVE A GUEST PASS?

02:39.827 --> 02:42.430
- AND ONLY ONE GUEST.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.532
both: ASSHOLE.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.833
- FREEZING MY NIPPLES OFF
OUT HERE.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.435
- [gasps]
- ALL RIGHT, HONEY, YOU CAN GO.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.937
SEE SOME I.D.?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.939
- MM.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.575
- ANY DRUGS?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.677
- WORK THE POCKETS, HONEY.
WORK THE POCKETS.

02:56.710 --> 03:00.248
[men jeering]

03:00.281 --> 03:01.715
- YOU WANT ME
TO WASH YOUR BACK?

03:01.749 --> 03:05.619
- HMM, ANY EXCUSE
TO KEEP YOUR HANDS ON ME.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.955
- [chuckles]

03:07.988 --> 03:10.858
WELL, YOU KNOW, CLEANLINESS
IS NEXT TO HORNINESS.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.826
- MMM.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.828
I KNOW A REALLY COOL GAME
WE CAN PLAY.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.997
IT'S CALLED
"HIDE THE SOAP BAR."

03:17.030 --> 03:19.433
- OH.
both: [laugh]

03:19.467 --> 03:21.235
[phone ringing]

03:24.004 --> 03:25.739
- HELLO?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.341
YEAH?

03:27.375 --> 03:31.712
OH, HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

03:31.745 --> 03:34.382
NO FUCKING WAY.
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

03:34.415 --> 03:35.583
- WHAT?

03:35.616 --> 03:36.850
- PREPARED?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.719
I'VE BEEN PREPARING
MY WHOLE LIFE.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.721
YEAH, OKAY.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.357
THANKS, MAN.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.792
THAT WAS GLEN.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.860
YOSEF TREBLEK
HAD A TRIPLE BYPASS.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.028
- WHO'S YOSEF TREBLEK?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.464
- THIS--THIS HUNGARIAN
VIOLINIST.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.032
- OH, GOD, THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- NO, NO, NO,

03:52.065 --> 03:54.001
IT'S THE GREATEST NEWS
EVER.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.869
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PLAY
THE HARRISBURG SYMPHONY,

03:55.903 --> 03:58.906
BUT OBVIOUSLY, HE CAN'T NOW,
SO GLEN SUGGESTED ME,

03:58.939 --> 04:01.008
THE SILVER MEDALIST
FOR THE HEIFETZ COMPETITION,

04:01.041 --> 04:02.876
AS THE LAST-MINUTE
REPLACEMENT,

04:02.910 --> 04:04.378
AND THEY SAID YES!
THEY SAID YES!

04:04.412 --> 04:05.679
- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S YOUR FIRST CONCERT.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.014
- [giggles]

04:07.047 --> 04:08.616
IT'S NOT PHILADELPHIA
OR BOSTON, BUT--

04:08.649 --> 04:10.284
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S A START.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.920
- OH, GOD.
[moans]

04:12.953 --> 04:15.923
I WISH YOU COULD
BE THERE WITH ME.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.892
- I WISH I COULD TOO.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.529
BUT YOUR AGENT WOULD FLIP OUT
IF I WAS THERE.

04:21.562 --> 04:25.032
- YEAH, I KNOW.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.901
HEY, I WAS, UH...

04:27.935 --> 04:32.072
I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS
WHEN THE PHONE RANG.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.841
I BOUGHT TWO OF THEM.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.644
THEY WEREN'T VERY EXPENSIVE,
BUT THE GUY AT THE STORE

04:36.677 --> 04:39.380
SWORE TO ME THAT THEY WERE
ONE-OF-A-KIND.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.048
AND...

04:41.081 --> 04:44.852
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WAY
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER,

04:44.885 --> 04:47.821
EVEN WHEN WE'RE APART.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.006
- (TV announcer) CITIZEN,
WAR HERO, COP,

05:06.039 --> 05:09.677
CHIEF OF POLICE.

05:09.710 --> 05:14.882
JIM STOCKWELL: YOU CAN SLEEP
AT NIGHT KNOWING HE'S THE MAYOR.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.852
PAID FOR BY THE COMMITTEE
TO ELECT JIM STOCKWELL.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.096
- WELL?

05:29.129 --> 05:33.434
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:33.467 --> 05:36.904
- IF I WANT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT,
I CAN TAKE A XANAX.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.572
OR I COULD WATCH
YOUR AD.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.140
- [clears throat]

05:40.173 --> 05:42.610
- WHAT MY PARTNER MEANS--

05:42.643 --> 05:45.112
- WHAT I MEAN IS,
IT'S FUCKING BORING.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.448
- THAT SPOT WAS MADE
BY ONE OF THE BEST AGENCIES

05:47.481 --> 05:49.450
IN THE STATE.
- 96% OF THE TEST GROUP

05:49.483 --> 05:51.051
WE SHOWED IT TO
REACTED FAVORABLY.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.853
- WHO WERE THEY,
INSOMNIACS?

05:52.886 --> 05:56.156
- OUR LOYAL SUPPORTERS.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.993
- WELL, YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
THEIR VOTE.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.029
WHAT ABOUT THE VOTERS
WHO ARE UNDECIDED,

06:02.062 --> 06:03.864
OR THE ONES WHO WOULDN'T
CAST A BALLOT

06:03.897 --> 06:05.799
FOR A LAW AND ORDER
CANDIDATE?

06:05.833 --> 06:08.902
YOU HAVE TO PULL THEM INTO YOUR
CAMP IF YOU WANT TO WIN.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.004
AND THERE IS
NO WAY IN HELL

06:11.038 --> 06:12.740
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT
WITH THAT.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.576
- I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
A BETTER PLAN?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.512
- DO YOU WORK OUT?

06:18.546 --> 06:20.147
- FOUR TIMES A WEEK,
RELIGIOUSLY.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.484
- ANY SPORTS?
- GOLF, SWIMMING, BASKETBALL.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.018
- HOBBIES?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.487
- BUILD MODEL AIRPLANES.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.621
- NO SHIT?

06:27.655 --> 06:29.022
I DID THAT
WHEN I WAS A KID.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.691
YOU TOO?
- SURE, WHO DIDN'T?

06:30.724 --> 06:31.925
BUT WHAT'S THE, UM--
- WHAT'S THE POINT?

06:31.959 --> 06:33.661
THE POINT IS,
I CAN RELATE TO IT,

06:33.694 --> 06:35.529
EVERYONE CAN.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.065
BUT WHO THE HELL'S GONNA RELATE
TO SOME STIFF IN A UNIFORM?

06:38.098 --> 06:40.200
- BRIAN, TAKE IT EASY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.935
I DON'T MIND THE TRUTH.

06:41.969 --> 06:45.038
EVEN IF YOU USE IT
LIKE AN ASSAULT WEAPON.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.941
SO...
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.643
- CHANGE YOUR IMAGE.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.078
STOP SELLING YOURSELF
AS A HERO

06:51.111 --> 06:53.080
AND START SELLING YOURSELF
AS A MAN.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.182
- THAT'S IT?
- AN ORDINARY MAN,

06:55.215 --> 06:57.685
WITH THE SAME CARES
AND CONCERNS AS EVERYONE ELSE.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.553
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,
YOU'RE IN A POSITION

06:59.587 --> 07:01.054
TO ACTUALLY
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

07:01.088 --> 07:05.192
- LOOK, I KNOW I CAME TO YOU
FOR SOME FRESH IDEAS.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.727
HOWEVER,
IT'S A RADICAL CHANGE

07:06.760 --> 07:09.963
FROM THE CAMPAIGN
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING.

07:09.997 --> 07:13.701
- TOO RADICAL.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.569
- WELL, IT'S YOUR CALL,

07:15.603 --> 07:16.870
BUT WITH THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING,

07:16.904 --> 07:19.940
I'D SAY YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE...

07:19.973 --> 07:23.944
EXCEPT FOR THE ELECTION.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.714
- SEE NOW, THIS SHADE
OF APRICOT FOR THE WALLS

07:26.747 --> 07:28.716
IS CALLING OUT
FOR A PLUM CARPET,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.751
WHICH PRACTICALLY SCREAMS
FOR THE RASPBERRY COUCH

07:30.784 --> 07:32.586
WITH THE PEACH CUSHIONS.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.121
- YEAH, I KNEW I SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN THE FRUIT COBBLER.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.823
[snickers]
- ISN'T IT A BIT EXTREME?

07:35.856 --> 07:38.559
FOR EMMETT,
I'D SAY IT'S A BIT SUBDUED.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.093
- EXCUSE ME?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.962
- YOU'RE MOVING INTO A DIFFERENT
KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.765
IT'S NOT THE GAY GHETTO.
IT'S A BEDROOM COMMUNITY.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.166
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE?
- YES,

07:46.199 --> 07:48.702
IT'S MORE TRADITIONAL,
MORE RESERVED.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.270
SO MAYBE YOU WANT
TO CHANGE YOUR STYLE,

07:50.303 --> 07:51.872
LOSE THE STREISAND POSTERS.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.974
- THE MAIN EVENT
WAS GOING IN THE ENTRY.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.142
- THE SLAVE BOY LAMPS?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.710
- IT'S GOING ON THE BAR,
RIGHT?

07:56.744 --> 07:58.111
- YOU JUST WANT TO THINK
ABOUT FITTING IN,

07:58.145 --> 08:00.681
RATHER THAN STANDING OUT.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.149
- THINK OUR HOUSE.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.851
- YOUR HOUSE?
AM I TO BELIEVE

08:03.884 --> 08:05.018
I'M ACTUALLY
GETTING DECORATOR TIPS

08:05.052 --> 08:06.587
FROM LESBIANS?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.055
- LOOK, THIS IS
EMMETT'S PROJECT, RIGHT?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.857
HE'S GOT CARTE BLANCHE
TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS

08:09.890 --> 08:14.662
WITH THE HOUSE.
STREISAND, PLUMS, KUMQUATS.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.263
IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS,
THEN THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.998
ALL RIGHT?
- HAVE FUN.

08:18.031 --> 08:18.999
- GOOD LUCK.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.769
- HMM, HMM.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.637
- BY THE WAY,
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME,

08:23.671 --> 08:25.639
AND I DIDN'T HEAR IT
FROM MY COP BOYFRIEND,

08:25.673 --> 08:27.074
BUT THERE'S
A CERTAIN POLICE CHIEF

08:27.107 --> 08:28.809
WHO WANTS TO BE MAYOR
WHO'S TRYING TO GET

08:28.842 --> 08:30.944
SOME ATTENTION FOR HIMSELF
BY GOING AFTER BUSINESSES

08:30.978 --> 08:33.814
THAT PANDER TO,
SHALL WE SAY--

08:33.847 --> 08:35.182
- PRURIENT INTERESTS?

08:35.215 --> 08:38.886
- I WAS GONNA SAY
WEB-WHACKERS.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.220
- WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, DEB.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.755
I RUN A CLEAN OPERATION.

08:41.789 --> 08:45.225
- [scoffs]
TEDDY IS IMMACULATE.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.028
HE EVEN RINSES OUT HIS UNDERWEAR
BEFORE HE PUTS THEM

08:48.061 --> 08:49.162
IN THE LAUNDRY.
[laughs]

08:49.196 --> 08:50.698
- HONEY,
IF THEY WANT TO,

08:50.731 --> 08:53.166
THEY CAN ALWAYS
FIND SOMETHING.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.968
- WELL, THANKS
FOR THE HEADS-UP, DEB.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.237
- WELL, DON'T THANK ME...

08:57.270 --> 08:59.773
THANK
"BENEDICT ARNOLD" KINNEY.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.642
HE'S THE ONE WORKING
FOR THE ENEMY.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.243
- NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.078
I'LL HAVE
A SPLIT-PEA SOUP TO GO.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.582
- JUSTIN, A SPLIT-PEA.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.183
AND FEEL FREE
TO PISS IN IT.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.785
- YOU SHOULD REALLY LEARN
TO SEPARATE

09:11.819 --> 09:13.687
YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS
FROM BUSINESS, DEB.

09:16.624 --> 09:20.227
- IT'S THREE BUCKS.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.732
- WHERE'D YOU GET
THE RING?

09:24.765 --> 09:25.966
- ETHAN.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.334
[cash register dings]

09:27.367 --> 09:28.836
- HOW ROMANTIC.

09:28.869 --> 09:32.840
- FUCK-ALL YOU'D KNOW
ABOUT ROMANCE.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.375
- KEEP IT.
- THAT'S A BIG TIP.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.811
- MAYBE YOU COULD BUY HIM
SOME FLOWERS.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.248
I'M SURE
HE'D LIKE THAT.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.951
[closes cash register drawer]

09:43.984 --> 09:47.855
- [hums]

09:50.390 --> 09:52.225
- ARE YOU HAVING
AN INTERNET AFFAIR, MICHAEL?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.727
HMM?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.696
YOU HAVE BEEN ON THAT
A LONG TIME.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.097
[growls]

09:57.130 --> 09:58.766
- DOING SOME RESEARCH.
- [grunts]

09:58.799 --> 10:00.701
[printer whirring]

10:00.734 --> 10:04.037
WORK?

10:04.071 --> 10:07.841
- FOR YOU.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.311
- ME?

10:17.317 --> 10:20.253
STEROIDS?

10:20.287 --> 10:24.725
- I SAW YOU.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.194
- SAW ME WHAT?
- SHOOTING UP.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.730
SO UNLESS YOU'VE SUDDENLY
BECOME A HEROIN ADDICT,

10:29.763 --> 10:33.066
I FIGURED
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.167
- MICHAEL,
ARE YOU SPYING ON ME?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.803
- SPYING ON YOU?

10:35.836 --> 10:38.138
WE LIVE TOGETHER.
HOW CAN I NOT NOTICE?

10:38.171 --> 10:41.875
- WELL, A LOT OF GUYS
ARE USING THEM, OKAY?

10:41.909 --> 10:44.177
TO FIGHT BODY WASTING.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.746
- YOU'RE NOT WASTING.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.014
- YET.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.282
- DID YOUR DOCTOR
PRESCRIBE THEM?

10:49.316 --> 10:50.751
- NO.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.420
- WELL, THEN
WHERE DID YOU GET THEM?

10:53.453 --> 10:55.022
- WHAT IS THIS,
AN INTERROGATION?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.323
- I'M JUST CONCERNED,
THAT'S ALL.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.025
IT SAYS THERE ARE
A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.728
MOOD SWINGS, DIARRHEA,
LIVER DAMAGE--

11:00.761 --> 11:01.962
- YEAH, I'M AWARE OF
THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.463
MICHAEL, I HAVE DONE
MY RESEARCH TOO.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.666
- WELL, THEN, WE SHOULD'VE
AT LEAST TALKED IT OVER.

11:13.073 --> 11:17.377
- LOOK...

11:17.410 --> 11:19.847
I'M JUST TRYING A CYCLE,
OKAY?

11:19.880 --> 11:23.083
SEE IF IT MAKES
ANY DIFFERENCE.

11:23.116 --> 11:27.054
AND SO FAR, THE ADVANTAGES
ARE BEATING THE DISADVANTAGES.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.456
HUH?
[grunts]

11:29.489 --> 11:32.125
[growls]

11:32.159 --> 11:34.394
HMM? YEAH? HUH?

11:34.427 --> 11:37.397
UGH, UGH.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.933
HUH? HUH?

11:39.967 --> 11:42.335
IT'S NOT TOO BAD, HUH?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.938
- IT'S FINE.

11:44.972 --> 11:48.408
- [whispering]
HOW ABOUT THAT?

11:48.441 --> 11:51.278
- NICE.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.247
OH, DON'T TELL ME
IT WORKS ON THAT TOO.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.352
- MMM.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.221
- HEY, OVER HERE!

12:01.254 --> 12:02.489
IN THE CLEAR!
IN THE CLEAR!

12:02.522 --> 12:04.124
- GET ON HIM, GET ON HIM,
GET ON HIM!

12:04.157 --> 12:05.826
- OKAY, GOT IT.

12:05.859 --> 12:06.860
[men cheering]
- GOOD SHOT.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.863
OKAY, TAKE IT OUT.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.235
[grunts]
- YEAH!

12:15.268 --> 12:18.338
- YOU'RE GUARDING.
MOVE A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT THERE.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.511
- STAY ON HIM,
STAY ON HIM.

12:24.544 --> 12:29.282
- OKAY, LAY-UPS, GUYS.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.051
I'M JIM STOCKWELL,

12:31.084 --> 12:34.387
POLICE CHIEF AND COACH
OF MY SON'S BASKETBALL TEAM.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.124
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU COULD
SEND YOUR KIDS TO THE PARK.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.126
BEFORE SEX AND DRUGS
WERE AVAILABLE

12:39.159 --> 12:40.861
ON EVERY STREET CORNER.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.530
AS A CRIME FIGHTER
AND A PARENT,

12:43.563 --> 12:46.133
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THOSE TIMES AGAIN.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.068
I KNOW YOU WOULD TOO.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.537
VOTE FOR ME FOR MAYOR,

12:50.570 --> 12:55.342
AND LET'S MAKE PITTSBURGH
FAMILY-FRIENDLY ONCE MORE.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.010
- AND CUT.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.012
- KEEP ROLLING, KEEP ROLLING,
KEEP ROLLING.

12:59.046 --> 13:03.350
- [breathing heavily]

13:03.383 --> 13:04.551
HOW WAS THAT?

13:04.584 --> 13:06.153
- THAT WAS GREAT.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.320
- GREAT.
- DID YOU GET THAT?

13:07.354 --> 13:08.956
- YEP, I GOT IT.

13:08.989 --> 13:12.359
- THANKS.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.294
- HOW WAS THAT?

13:14.327 --> 13:17.164
- IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D SWEAR YOU WERE TOM CRUISE.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.567
[men chatter]

13:20.600 --> 13:23.570
- FREEZE IN THE BACKGROUND.
THIS IS SOUND ONLY.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.172
- AND--
- THIS IS SOUND ONLY.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.308
- EVERYONE HAVE
VALID I.D.s?

13:28.341 --> 13:31.178
all: YES, SIR!

13:31.211 --> 13:33.246
- MM-HMM.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.515
ANY CONVICTED FELONS?

13:35.548 --> 13:37.184
all: NO, SIR!

13:37.217 --> 13:40.187
- MM-HMM.

13:40.220 --> 13:44.191
ANY ILLEGAL DRUGS
ON THE PREMISES?

13:44.224 --> 13:47.861
all: NO, SIR!

13:49.963 --> 13:53.600
- EXCELLENT.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.335
ALL RIGHT.
BACK TO WORK.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.070
all: YES, SIR!
- OH, AND, UH,

13:57.104 --> 13:59.206
KEEP IT CLEAN.
all: YES, SIR!

13:59.239 --> 14:01.408
- I MEAN, YEAH,
KEEP IT DIRTY BUT--

14:01.441 --> 14:03.443
all: YES, SIR!

14:06.646 --> 14:10.550
[sighs] FIRE ALARMS,
SPRINKLER SYSTEMS,

14:10.583 --> 14:13.020
HANDICAPPED RAMP,
TOILETS.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.156
- ALL UP TO CODE,
MR. SCHMIDT.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.491
- ANY RODENTS OR PESTS
ON THE PREMISES?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.527
- ONLY THE HUMAN KIND,
MR. SCHMIDT.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.030
- ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS
THE CORRECT SIZE

14:23.063 --> 14:25.298
AND CLEARLY POSTED?
- MEASURED TO THE INCH.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.535
JUST LIKE YOUR JERKERS,
MR. SCHMIDT.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.403
- WELL THEN, EDDIE,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.906
I'D SAY WE HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

14:32.940 --> 14:37.177
EVERY DETAIL HAS BEEN CHECKED
AND RE-CHECKED.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.512
LET 'EM COME AND INSPECT.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.050
WE, AT TEDDY'S WHACK-SHACK,
ARE READY FOR THEM.

14:43.083 --> 14:47.054
[men moaning]

14:50.157 --> 14:54.161
- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
YOUR FIRST CONCERT APPEARANCE?

14:54.194 --> 14:58.331
SCARED, CONFIDENT,
EXCITED?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.134
- DEFINITELY
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.936
- YOU KNOW, IT'S QUITE
A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT

15:02.970 --> 15:06.940
FOR SOMEONE SO YOUNG,
AND OBVIOUSLY, SO GIFTED

15:06.974 --> 15:11.411
TO HAVE
SUCH SUDDEN SUCCESS.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.347
I UNDERSTAND
THAT UNTIL RECENTLY,

15:14.381 --> 15:16.616
YOU WERE PERFORMING
ON STREET CORNERS?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.018
- WELL,
YOU GOTTA PAY THE RENT.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.086
- [laughs]

15:19.119 --> 15:21.154
[door opening]

15:21.188 --> 15:24.157
- WHAT'S UP?

15:24.191 --> 15:27.427
- THIS IS JUSTIN, MY COUSIN,
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, DAPHNE.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.562
THEY LIKE TO USE THE APARTMENT
SOMETIMES WHEN I'M NOT HERE.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.331
HEY, GUYS,
THIS IS ALEXA SCOTT,

15:31.364 --> 15:35.702
SHE'S, UH, INTERVIEWING ME
FOR THE PAPER.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.504
- RIGHT.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.306
- SO...

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
COME BACK ANOTHER TIME?

15:41.208 --> 15:44.177
- SURE.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.946
COME ON, DAPH.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.252
- SORRY
ABOUT THE INTERRUPTION.

15:52.285 --> 15:56.723
- OH.
JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.460
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

16:00.493 --> 16:03.330
- I'D PREFER
NOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.133
- OH.
THAT USUALLY MEANS YES.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.135
- [laughs]
- [laughs]

16:08.168 --> 16:11.271
- "GIRLFRIEND"?
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.740
- HIS AGENT DOESN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW HE'S GAY.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.342
HE THINKS IT COULD
HURT HIS CAREER.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.677
- WHO GIVES A SHIT
WHO A VIOLINIST IS FUCKING?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.679
- DON'T ASK ME.

16:19.712 --> 16:24.217
I AGREED
TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.253
- YOU KNOW,
BRIAN MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

16:26.286 --> 16:28.088
EVERYTHING YOU WANTED
IN A BOYFRIEND,

16:28.121 --> 16:30.690
BUT AT LEAST HE NEVER
ASKED YOU TO LIE.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.226
- HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS ENTIRE
FUTURE CAREER AT STAKE.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.627
- SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE
HIS COUSIN?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.629
LIKE ANYONE'S DUMB ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE THAT.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.231
- NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.632
- JUSTIN,
YOU ALMOST DIED COMING OUT.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.634
HOW COULD YOU
GO BACK IN FOR ANYONE?

16:41.668 --> 16:44.104
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
- BUT IT'S FUCKING UNFAIR OF HIM

16:44.137 --> 16:45.772
TO MAKE YOU PRETEND YOU'RE
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.374
- I SAID I DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

16:47.407 --> 16:53.080
SO WOULD YOU MIND
YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS?

16:58.818 --> 17:00.187
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THOSE DYKES
TELLING US

17:00.220 --> 17:02.189
HOW WE SHOULD
DECORATE OUR HOUSE?

17:02.222 --> 17:05.125
DON'T THEY REALIZE LAURA ASHLEY
WENT OUT WITH ROTARY PHONES?

17:05.158 --> 17:07.660
- NOW, NOW.
SHOW A LITTLE COMPASSION.

17:07.694 --> 17:12.065
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T HELP IT
IF THEY'RE DESIGN-CHALLENGED.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.534
- IT WOULD
LOOK STUNNING HERE.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.069
- WHAT WOULD?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.570
- A CHAIR AND OTTOMAN

17:17.604 --> 17:19.672
UPHOLSTERED IN DYED
BLUEBERRY OSTRICH-SKIN.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.541
- [chuckles]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.676
- BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES.
- HMM.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.712
AH, IT'S--
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, SO--

17:25.745 --> 17:27.480
- WHO CARES ABOUT COST?

17:27.514 --> 17:30.683
THIS ISN'T AN INVESTMENT,
IT'S A HOME.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.420
IT'S OUR HOME.
- HMM.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.156
THIS MUST BE A FAIRY TALE
'CAUSE I MARRIED A PRINCE.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.291
both: [chuckle]

17:38.325 --> 17:40.193
- OH, WHOOPS!
[chuckles]

17:40.227 --> 17:41.294
SORRY, GUYS.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.595
I'M JUST HERE TO REPORT,

17:42.629 --> 17:44.431
THE HOUSE INSPECTOR'S
DOING JUST FINE.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.466
NO MAJOR PROBLEMS SO FAR,
KNOCK WOOD.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.168
[knocking at the door]

17:48.201 --> 17:49.302
WELL.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.505
both: [chuckle]

17:52.539 --> 17:55.508
- HI, I'M SUNNY,
SUNNY REED.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.844
ACTUALLY, IT'S "SUSANNA,"
BUT EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY,

17:57.877 --> 17:59.612
THEY CALLED ME SUNNY,
I GUESS

17:59.646 --> 18:02.249
JUST BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAVE
THE SUNNIEST SMILE ON MY FACE.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.385
- OH, I-I'M JENNIFER.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.587
EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY,
THEY'VE CALLED ME JENNIFER.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.256
- WELL, WELCOME
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.790
I JUST KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO LOVE IT HERE.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.326
- OH, THANKS.
I'M JUST THE REALTOR,

18:13.360 --> 18:16.329
I'M NOT THE NEW OWNER.
- THAT'D BE ME, TED SCHMIDT.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.865
- OH, HI, TED!
SUNNY, SUNNY REED.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.268
MY HUSBAND AND I
JUST LIVE NEXT DOOR.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.869
WELCOME
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.537
I BROUGHT YOU
A CARAMEL CAKE.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.506
I'M FAMOUS
FOR MY CARAMEL CAKE.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.342
BUT DON'T WORRY, TED, I'LL SHARE
THE RECIPE WITH MRS. SCHMIDT.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.612
WHERE IS MRS. SCHMIDT?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.814
- THAT'D BE ME.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.349
- THEN YOU'RE--

18:36.383 --> 18:38.818
- THAT'D BE US.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.354
- WELL, ISN'T THAT
INTERESTING?

18:41.388 --> 18:43.790
WELL, I JUST KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT HERE, EVERYBODY DOES.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.159
WE JUST HAVE THE BEST SCHOOLS
AND CHURCHES,

18:46.193 --> 18:51.498
AND EVERYBODY BABYSITS AND
LOOKS OUT FOR EACH OTHER'S KIDS.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.266
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A VERY FRIENDLY GROUP OF PEOPLE,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.235
DOESN'T IT, GUYS?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.170
- VERY.
- FRIENDLY.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.440
- IN FACT, IT'S A TRADITION
THAT WE HOST A COCKTAIL PARTY

19:00.473 --> 19:02.409
FOR OUR NEW ARRIVALS.
NOTHING FORMAL,

19:02.442 --> 19:05.778
JUST A LITTLE "HI, WELCOME TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD" KIND OF THING.

19:05.812 --> 19:11.384
SO HOW'S FRIDAY AT AROUND 6:00,
JUST RIGHT NEXT DOOR?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.320
- WELL, THANK YOU,
SUNNY.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.189
- SUCH A LOVELY HOUSE.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.392
THE HARRISES, THEY JUST HAD
THE MOST EXQUISITE TASTE.

19:19.426 --> 19:23.796
EARLY AMERICAN FURNITURE
AND ORIENTAL RUGS.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.266
WELL, I SHOULD GO.
[laughs]

19:26.299 --> 19:27.667
OH, YOUR CAKE!
- OH.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.735
all: [laugh]

19:28.768 --> 19:30.670
- OH!
SEE YOU FRIDAY.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.804
[giggles]
- SEE YOU FRIDAY.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.473
- GOOD-BYE, SUNNY.
- BYE.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.276
- TOODLES.
- THANKS.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.346
THERE YOU GO,
MRS. SCHMIDT.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.414
- JEN SAID
THAT TED AND EMMETT'S NEW HOUSE

19:41.448 --> 19:42.982
HAS TONS OF CURB APPEAL.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.817
- LIKE YOU.
- OH.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.553
- ALTHOUGH WHY THOSE TWO
WOULD WANT TO LIVE

19:46.586 --> 19:48.821
AROUND A BUNCH OF BREEDERS
IS BEYOND ME.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.758
- A LOT OF US ARE
MOVING ON UP THESE DAYS.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.960
- I'LL TAKE
LIBERTY AVENUE.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.696
- OH.
OH, SHIT!

19:56.729 --> 19:58.231
- WHAT?

19:58.265 --> 20:00.700
- MY GOOD RING
JUST FELL BEHIND THE FRIDGE.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.968
- YOUR "GOOD RING"?

20:02.001 --> 20:04.437
- YEAH, THE ONE I GOT
ON THE TV SHOW.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.306
- FROM THE JOAN RIVERS
COLLECTION?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.774
- AND DON'T SAY
A FUCKING THING AGAINST HER.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.709
- [laughs]
- I LIKE THAT SHE'S GOT

20:09.742 --> 20:11.711
A BIG, DIRTY MOUTH
THAT GETS HER IN TROUBLE.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.712
- I WONDER WHY.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.980
- SOMEONE GIVE ME A HAND.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.582
- WHAT--MA, WAIT.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.749
- SOMEONE GIVE ME A HAND HERE.
- OH, COME--

20:16.783 --> 20:17.984
DEBBIE, DEBBIE.
DEBBIE, DEBBIE, DEBBIE.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.386
- OH, LET ME DO THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.921
YOU'RE GONNA HURT
YOURSELF.

20:21.954 --> 20:26.826
[grunting]

20:28.361 --> 20:29.362
ALL RIGHT.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.730
- YOU SEE IT?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.765
- U-U-UMM...

20:32.799 --> 20:33.766
THIS?
- YES!

20:33.800 --> 20:34.867
both: [laugh]

20:34.901 --> 20:37.003
- OH, MY HERO.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.605
[chuckles]

20:38.638 --> 20:40.740
OH, NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A REAL MAN.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.675
- MWAH.
- WE COULD'VE DONE THE SAME.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.377
- YEAH,
WITH A FORKLIFT.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.378
[laughter]

20:45.412 --> 20:46.379
- OH, YEAH.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.381
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.387
OKAY, I BETTER GO
WASH MY HANDS.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.925
- HAS BEN ACTUALLY GOTTEN BIGGER
SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.927
- YEAH, WELL, HE'S BEEN
WORKING OUT A LOT LATELY.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.495
- AND IT SHOWS.
- HMM.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.397
WHAT'S HIS SECRET?

21:04.431 --> 21:07.567
- YOU KNOW, PROTEIN SHAKES,
LOW-CARB DIET, STUFF LIKE THAT.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.404
- DOES "STUFF LIKE THAT"
INCLUDE STEROIDS?

21:14.006 --> 21:16.943
- IS THAT WHAT HE'S DOING?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.547
- HE SAYS IT PREVENTS WASTING.
- WASTING?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.581
HE'S BUILT
LIKE A BRICK SHITHOUSE.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.550
- THE STUFF IS POISON.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.785
FOR ONE THING, IT MAKES YOU
MEANER THAN CAT PISS.

21:25.818 --> 21:26.853
AND FOR ANOTHER--
- FOR ANOTHER,

21:26.886 --> 21:29.522
IT'S NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.392
IF THAT'S WHAT BEN NEEDS TO DO
TO STAY ALIVE AND HEALTHY,

21:32.425 --> 21:34.927
THEN THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.929
- CAN'T ARGUE THAT...

21:36.963 --> 21:39.899
IF THAT'S
THE ONLY REASON.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.870
[ethereal music

21:43.903 --> 21:45.672
- I'M JIM STOCKWELL,

21:45.705 --> 21:49.676
POLICE CHIEF AND COACH
OF MY SON'S BASKETBALL TEAM.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.812
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU COULD
SEND YOUR KIDS TO THE PARK,

21:52.845 --> 21:56.115
BEFORE SEX AND DRUGS
WERE AVAILABLE ON EVERY CORNER.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.951
AS A CRIME FIGHTER
AND A PARENT,

21:58.985 --> 22:00.620
I'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE TIMES
AGAIN.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.088
I KNOW YOU WOULD TOO.

22:02.121 --> 22:05.558
VOTE FOR ME FOR MAYOR,

22:05.592 --> 22:09.562
AND LET'S MAKE PITTSBURGH
FAMILY-FRIENDLY ONCE MORE.

22:09.596 --> 22:15.535
*

22:18.137 --> 22:20.039
[music ends]

22:29.749 --> 22:31.651
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.987
- IT'S A MUSIC VIDEO,
NOT A CAMPAIGN ADVERTISEMENT.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.756
- THERE'S NO WAY
WE'RE GOING TO RUN THAT.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.925
- IT'S PRACTICALLY OBSCENE,
REVEALING HIS BODY

22:38.958 --> 22:42.862
LIKE SOME SORT
OF SEX OBJECT.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.466
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
SELLS CORN FLAKES?

22:46.499 --> 22:49.001
- THERE IS A STRATEGY
BEHIND ALL THIS:

22:49.035 --> 22:51.604
WHEN WE'LL AIR THE SPOT,
ON WHICH PROGRAMS.

22:51.638 --> 22:55.808
- THOSE WITH A STRONG
FEMALE DEMOGRAPHIC, AGES 18-34.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.649
- ALL RIGHT, DO IT.

23:02.682 --> 23:03.916
- JIM, YOU CAN'T--
- BUT IF YOU TURN ME

23:03.950 --> 23:06.653
INTO A JOKE...

23:06.686 --> 23:08.655
I'LL FUCKING HAVE
YOUR BALLS.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.090
- IF HE TURNS YOU
INTO A JOKE,

23:11.123 --> 23:14.026
I'LL FUCKING GIVE THEM
TO YOU.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.663
- [chuckles]

23:19.599 --> 23:22.068
[hair dryer humming]

23:22.101 --> 23:24.036
- EM?

23:24.070 --> 23:27.173
- HI, HON,
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.509
- THE NEW TRAVIATA
JUST CAME OUT.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.177
CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.646
- OH, YEAH?

23:33.680 --> 23:35.515
- [laughs]

23:35.548 --> 23:37.116
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

23:37.149 --> 23:39.652
- WELL, YOU PLANNING
ON GOING STRAIGHT AGAIN,

23:39.686 --> 23:41.688
OR IS THIS SOME KIND OF BIZARRO
CROSS-DRESSING PRACTICE

23:41.721 --> 23:43.590
YOU ENGAGE IN
WHEN I'M NOT AROUND?

23:43.623 --> 23:45.057
- I WAS JUST
PUTTING TOGETHER AN OUTFIT

23:45.091 --> 23:46.659
FOR THE NEIGHBOR'S PARTY.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.194
- WELL, YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN.
[chuckles]

23:48.227 --> 23:50.563
- OH, OH,
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.064
IT'S MY NEW COLOR SCHEME
FOR THE LIVING ROOM.

23:52.098 --> 23:56.068
MOCHA WALLS,
CHOCOLATE MOHAIR COUCH,

23:56.102 --> 23:59.105
AND, UM, CHARCOAL
TWEED CLUB CHAIRS.

23:59.138 --> 24:02.809
- IT'S...VERY SMART,
VERY SOPHISTICATED,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.744
BUT NOT VERY YOU.
I MEAN,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.813
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE PLUM CARPET,

24:06.846 --> 24:11.851
THE RASPBERRY SOFA, THE...
CASABA MELON PILLOWS?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.953
- PEACH.
- OH.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.822
- WELL, I...
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

24:15.855 --> 24:18.591
BUT YOU KNOW,
MAYBE MEL AND LINZ WERE RIGHT.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.727
IT WAS TOO FRUITY.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.731
- UH-HUH. SO INSTEAD,
WE GET ASSIMILATIONIST BEIGE,

24:24.764 --> 24:27.233
BLEND-RIGHT-IN BROWN,
AND MAKE-NO-WAVES GREY.

24:27.266 --> 24:30.269
- I JUST FIGURED THAT SINCE
WE'RE LEAVING LIBERTY AVENUE,

24:30.302 --> 24:33.172
MAYBE IT WAS TIME WE LEFT
CERTAIN OTHER THINGS BEHIND TOO.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.742
- LIKE OUR COLOR SCHEME
AND OUR SELF-RESPECT?

24:35.775 --> 24:41.614
I MEAN, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO "FUCK 'EM ALL" HONEYCUTT?

24:41.648 --> 24:43.883
- BACK IN HAZELHURST,

24:43.916 --> 24:47.720
I USED TO LOOK UP
AT THOSE HOUSES ON THE HILL,

24:47.754 --> 24:50.890
YOU KNOW, WHERE
THE RIGHT PEOPLE LIVED?

24:50.923 --> 24:55.261
AND DREAM THAT ONE DAY,
I WOULD LIVE THERE TOO.

24:55.294 --> 24:58.598
AND NOW THAT MY DREAM
IS FINALLY COMING TRUE, I...

24:58.631 --> 25:01.000
JUST, I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
THINKING TH--

25:01.033 --> 25:05.004
- THAT WE'RE THE FAGS
NEXT DOOR?

25:05.037 --> 25:06.873
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

25:06.906 --> 25:08.641
AND IF THEY DON'T SAY IT
TO OUR FACE,

25:08.675 --> 25:11.644
THEY'LL SAY IT
BEHIND OUR BACKS.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.784
WAIT THERE.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.625
THIS IS WHAT
THE WELL-DRESSED QUEER

25:25.658 --> 25:28.561
WILL BE WEARING
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.933
- I LOVE THAT SHIRT.
ISN'T IT SO CUTE?

25:33.966 --> 25:38.938
[indistinct chatter]

25:40.807 --> 25:42.174
- PERFECT.
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.644
- THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.212
LATER.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.353
- I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

25:54.386 --> 25:58.224
- GUESS NOT.
[sniffs]

25:58.257 --> 26:01.794
- YOU DON'T USUALLY WORK OUT
THIS TIME OF DAY, DO YOU?

26:01.828 --> 26:04.563
- NOT USUALLY.

26:09.035 --> 26:12.939
- LOOK,
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.843
- I THINK
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.813
MICHAEL TOLD ME HE WAS
GOING TO TALK TO YOU.

26:20.847 --> 26:24.851
- HUH.
YEAH, WELL HE DID,

26:24.884 --> 26:26.986
AND HE UNDERSTANDS.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.688
- [chuckles]

26:28.721 --> 26:32.124
WELL, THAT'S MICHAEL,
ALWAYS UNDERSTANDING.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.259
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

26:33.292 --> 26:34.727
- IF IT WAS JUST YOU,
I WOULD.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.362
AS MY DEAR OLD DAD
USED TO SAY,

26:36.395 --> 26:41.367
YOU'RE THREE TIMES SEVEN.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.837
BUT IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.172
YOU'RE TAKING HIM DOWN
WITH YOU.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.974
- I DO NOT NEED
TO BE LECTURED

26:48.007 --> 26:49.408
BY THE BIGGEST WHORE
IN PITTSBURGH.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.745
YOU ARE FUCKING LUCKY
YOU'RE NOT POSITIVE.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.820
- [grunts]

27:07.093 --> 27:08.995
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:09.028 --> 27:11.397
- SURE.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.333
- REALLY?

27:22.909 --> 27:25.411
IT WAS THE INTERVIEW.

27:25.444 --> 27:29.749
- NO.
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THAT.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.817
[chuckles]
DAPHNE WAS

27:30.850 --> 27:32.351
PRETTY PISSED OFF,
THOUGH.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.787
PASSING ME OFF AS YOUR COUSIN.
- WELL, COME ON.

27:34.821 --> 27:39.959
I HAD TO THINK OF SOMETHING.
- MM.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.428
IS THIS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE
FROM NOW ON?

27:42.461 --> 27:46.232
LYING, PLAYING GAMES.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.834
NOW YOU'RE GOING AWAY.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.435
- TO HARRISBURG
FOR ONE NIGHT.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.470
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING
ON A WORLD TOUR.

27:51.503 --> 27:55.374
- THAT'S NEXT.
- I WISH.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.244
LOOK.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.446
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
- MM.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.816
- I COULD BOMB,
AND THAT'LL BE THE END OF IT.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.252
BUT IF THIS WORKS,

28:06.285 --> 28:09.221
WE COULD HAVE
THIS AMAZING LIFE.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.792
I WAS THINKING,
WE COULD BUY A FARMHOUSE,

28:12.825 --> 28:18.064
WITH A STUDIO
AND A PRACTICE ROOM.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.066
- YOU DREAM BIG.
- WHY NOT?

28:20.099 --> 28:21.801
DOESN'T COST ANYTHING.

28:21.834 --> 28:26.372
- GOD,
YOU'RE SUCH A ROMANTIC.

28:26.405 --> 28:30.476
- I HATE THAT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE THERE WITH ME.

28:30.509 --> 28:33.813
- NOT AS MUCH AS ME.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.247
- HOW AM I GOING TO PERFORM
WITHOUT MY MUSE?

28:35.281 --> 28:38.484
- [chuckles]
YOU'LL DO FINE.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.821
BESIDES, YOU ALWAYS SAID
I WAS DISTRACTING.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.490
- DON'T YOU KNOW I WAS PLAYING
JUST FOR YOU?

28:44.523 --> 28:47.426
- [chuckles]

29:10.449 --> 29:13.419
- YOU'RE NOT READY.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.324
WELL, COME ON.
GET DRESSED.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.060
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS
ALL THAT HOT, MALE ACTION.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.564
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.800
- THIS.

29:27.834 --> 29:30.269
- HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

29:30.302 --> 29:32.004
WHAT, DID ONE OF YOUR
SEX PARTNERS GET CARRIED AWAY?

29:32.038 --> 29:34.040
- NO, ONE OF YOURS.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.308
YOUR BOYFRIEND PRACTICALLY
STUFFED ME INTO A LOCKER.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.476
- WHAT?
HOW COME?

29:37.509 --> 29:39.078
- WELL,
IT SEEMS I SAID SOMETHING

29:39.111 --> 29:41.480
ABOUT HIS STEROID USE
HE TOOK OBJECTION TO.

29:41.513 --> 29:45.484
- WHY'D YOU SAY ANYTHING
AT ALL?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.219
- UM...

29:47.253 --> 29:50.957
BECAUSE IT'S UNDIGNIFIED
FOR A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR

29:50.990 --> 29:52.424
AND NOT-SO-BEST-SELLING
AUTHOR

29:52.458 --> 29:55.828
TO BE SEEN MAKING DRUG DEALS
IN A LOCKER ROOM.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.466
- YOU SAW HIM?
- YEAH.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.301
AND NOW, I'LL BE FORCED
TO SIT AT HOME,

30:02.334 --> 30:06.338
NOT WEARING MY MOST FABULOUS
NEW SLEEVELESS SHIRT TO BABYLON.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.307
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- YEAH, LIKE THAT MAKES UP

30:08.340 --> 30:10.042
FOR THE FACT THAT I'LL BE
SCARRED FOR LIFE.

30:10.076 --> 30:14.313
- WELL, YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE
YOU GOT IT DUELING.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.581
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TALK TO HIM.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.383
- I DID.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.185
HE SAID IT'S SOMETHING
HE NEEDS TO DO.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.453
- [scoffs]
BEN NEEDS MORE MUSCLES

30:21.487 --> 30:23.089
LIKE I NEED
ANOTHER COCK.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.623
- HE SAID HE'S AWARE
OF THE SIDE EFFECTS.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.226
- LIKE PRACTICALLY MURDERING
HIS LOVER'S BEST FRIEND?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.095
WELL, IF YOU'RE COOL
WITH SLEEPING

30:29.128 --> 30:30.963
WITH YOUR EYES OPEN
AND A HATCHET UNDER YOUR PILLOW,

30:30.997 --> 30:33.465
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.436
JUST KEEP HIM
THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.409
- OKAY,
I GOT MY RENTED TUX,

30:43.442 --> 30:46.212
MY TRAIN TICKET.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.980
MISHA.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.216
OKAY, I GUESS
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.084
EXCEPT YOU.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.120
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.

30:54.153 --> 30:57.356
- I LOVE "STIFF UPPER LIP"
GOOD-BYES.

30:57.389 --> 31:01.260
SO, MRS. MINIVER.
- WHO'S SHE?

31:01.293 --> 31:03.963
- IT'S FROM AN OLD MOVIE.
DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

31:03.996 --> 31:06.665
- I'M AN IDIOT.
- AW, SHUT UP.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.400
- CAREFUL.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.236
THERE MIGHT BE PAPARAZZI
LURKING ON THE ROOFTOPS.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.403
- FUCK 'EM.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.638
- LOOK!

31:12.671 --> 31:16.408
[laughter and jeering]

31:16.442 --> 31:18.044
- [laughs]

31:20.546 --> 31:23.115
I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

31:23.149 --> 31:25.251
WISHING YOU WERE THERE.
- ME TOO.

31:25.284 --> 31:28.254
- YOU WILL BE.
- OH, GOD.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.122
- WHAT A CORNBALL.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.959
- IT'S WHY YOU LOVE ME.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.545
- THIS IS AMAZING,
JUST AMAZING.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.315
- YOU'VE GONE UP EIGHT POINTS
IN THE POLLS.
