<i>The water renews
but does not shed its layers. No.</i>

00:27.402 --> 00:29.947
<i>It drags buried memories to the present.</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:37.079
<i>Once, below these waters,</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:43.001
<i>giant predators swam. Mythical.</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:48.382
<i>Those predators grew legs
and made it to land.</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:52.219
<i>If they could do that,
would it be so surprising if once,</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:57.558
<i>upon one of these times,
witches had been here too?</i>

00:59.852 --> 01:04.022
<i>Each tale told upon this water
informs the next story...</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:06.692
<i>and the next.</i>

02:20.766 --> 02:22.768
Don't know why I had to come out here.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.522
Man agrees to pay you $70,000 for a book,

02:27.105 --> 02:29.441
you best believe you deliver
that shit to him personally.

02:30.943 --> 02:35.030
You know what we look like?
Two drug dealers out to make a sale.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.075
Drug dealers don't gift wrap.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.621
Yeah. I think we should make that...

02:43.622 --> 02:45.332
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.416
Yeah. No problem.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.213
Here you go.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.174
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.177
You got another meeting tonight?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.179
What?

02:59.179 --> 03:02.015
The Survivors Club at the
Chinese Community Center in Flushing.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.142
You been stalking me?

03:05.143 --> 03:08.188
It popped up on the
tribute page when you checked in online.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.316
The tribute what?
What are you talking about?

03:11.316 --> 03:12.401
Tribute page.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.362
For Brian.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.953
"Tribute to Brian."

03:24.204 --> 03:25.414
I'm a fan.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.625
Not a fan, but, you know what I mean.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.836
<i>May angels watch over
that poor child...</i>

03:30.836 --> 03:31.753
<i>Rest in piss.</i>

03:31.753 --> 03:33.338
<i>Two working parents cannot raise a child.</i>

03:33.338 --> 03:35.215
- <i>Genetically unfit.</i>
- <i>Postpartem.</i>

03:35.215 --> 03:36.300
<i>Apollo killed them both...</i>

03:36.300 --> 03:39.887
<i>Dinner plans tonight.
A meal inspired by baby Brian.</i>

03:39.887 --> 03:41.180
<i>Boiled vegetables.</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:44.975
"Boiled vegetables."
Who the hell are these people, man?

03:46.977 --> 03:47.978
Like, what--

03:49.188 --> 03:51.106
Why would this guy make this?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.357
I thought you knew.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.610
My man, I never w--

03:55.110 --> 03:56.820
When I went there,
I saw that you checked in

03:56.820 --> 03:58.488
with The Survivors.
I figured that meant you knew.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.783
No. I checked in
so if my parole officer logged on,

04:01.783 --> 04:02.993
that I'd be able to cover my ass,

04:02.993 --> 04:04.912
but I didn't know it was gonna
end up on this.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.164
Wow. Here I am tripping on witches,

04:07.164 --> 04:10.417
meanwhile social media's
conjuring up something way worse.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.669
What you say?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.963
Nothing, man. I'm not talking to you.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.137
Is that our guy?

04:24.348 --> 04:28.352
Wow. Beige on beige. Tan man.
Very fashionable.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.647
Who the fuck still drinks Tab?

04:32.940 --> 04:36.360
Okay, this is a man who has not been
with a woman in a very long time.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.363
In years. Decades.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.699
One of these incel fat fucks
always posting heinous shit online

04:42.699 --> 04:44.451
about how no one appreciates
how special he is

04:44.451 --> 04:47.788
- and how women only want jerks.
- All right. Calm down.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.666
This is the guy that's gonna
give us a five-figure check, all right?

04:50.666 --> 04:51.583
But keep it up.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.464
I was wrong.
This guy's never been with a woman.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.551
You wanna know
what else he's probably never done?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.557
He's probably never
joined a Baby Brian fan page.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.101
- Hey.
- Apollo.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.771
Hey, William.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.231
Don't trip. He seems safe.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.525
Hey. Good to see you.
Lemme take you to my office.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.779
Sorry. It's a bit of a mess.

05:20.779 --> 05:21.947
It's all right.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.824
Here. Let me--

05:26.159 --> 05:27.160
That's cute.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.038
Oh, yeah. Those are from my daughters.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.624
See, he's got daughters.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.877
And one wife.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.131
I used to call them
my little strawberries.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.011
When they'd get mad,
their faces would get so red.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.348
Got that from me.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.913
Nobody said anything about boats.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.000
"Have you ever been
in a cockpit before, Joey?"

06:18.212 --> 06:19.755
Yeah, I'm old.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.552
Come on. Just ignore me.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.059
Here she is.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.855
Guys, come on.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.440
Yeah.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.784
You know, I can't swim.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.703
- Guys, come down.
- I'll just grab here. Okay.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.416
I got beer.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.798
I'm gonna die. Yep.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.269
It's a nice boat.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.566
Okay, guys. I'm no good at secrets.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.317
You stole the boat?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.822
I didn't steal it, but it's not mine.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.995
I built this app myself.
It's called Rock-A-Bye.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.622
It's like Airbnb, but for boats.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.791
We got this thing for two whole hours.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.461
Okay. I-- But I need to be
in Flushing by five, so I think--

07:41.461 --> 07:43.797
We're not going anywhere.
I don't know how to drive a boat.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.507
- You're a coder?
- Yeah.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.801
And I built my older daughter's
first laptop.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.470
- Put a Core i5 processor in her.
- That's pretty impressive.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
Back at my place, I got me a--

07:54.016 --> 07:57.186
Wow. You guys wrapped it too?
That's really nice.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.939
It was always meant to be a gift anyway.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.073
You know, I guess I hoped
to see it before I bought it.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.035
- You wanna--
- That's okay.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.120
You know, I trust you guys.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.290
Here. Give it to me. Here.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.501
It's-- I'll do it for you.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.668
It's a gift?

08:22.419 --> 08:23.420
Yeah, for my wife.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.506
Birthday?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.257
We're estranged.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.676
She moved back
with her parents in Bay Shore.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.887
I've been on my own 11 whole months now.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.851
Wow.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.895
It's beautiful.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.898
It's got the-- Yeah.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.028
"...Daddy of our dreams."

08:49.112 --> 08:50.572
First edition.

08:52.908 --> 08:53.909
It's perfect.

08:55.744 --> 08:58.497
You know, Gretta's dad used to read this
to her when she was little.

08:59.831 --> 09:03.335
Gretta Strickland. That's my wife.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.463
From Alabama,

09:07.798 --> 09:08.924
just like in this.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.344
It's just a story
about a good father, right?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.682
I think her dad used to read this to her
to show her a model of that, you know?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.142
Then she married me.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.688
I wasn't Atticus Finch.

09:22.688 --> 09:25.482
Yeah, well, neither was he.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.402
'Cause of the other book.

09:29.111 --> 09:32.114
I was that man that thought
you just worked and worked,

09:32.114 --> 09:33.991
provided, and that made you a great dad.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.661
But you know what happens
when you do that?

09:38.912 --> 09:44.001
You look up after 25 years,
your wife and your kids,

09:44.001 --> 09:45.294
they don't know you.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.337
All those new dads.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.048
Those guys at the park
with their kids, 6:00 in the morning...

09:55.596 --> 09:56.889
That's the good stuff.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.849
And I know what matters now.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.520
I know I could do better if she came back.

10:05.272 --> 10:10.694
And I love my daughters so much,
and I never said it.

10:11.987 --> 10:12.988
No, I never said it.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.324
And people need to hear the words,
you know?

10:16.909 --> 10:17.910
Yes.

10:19.703 --> 10:23.624
And now it's costing me everything I saved
just to try and win her back with this.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.669
I mean, what's your feeling, guys?
Could it work?

10:29.087 --> 10:31.298
- I--
- Yeah, tell her whatever you told us, man.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.301
- I'm gonna wrap it back up for you.
- Tell her that. Okay?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.470
There you go.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.138
I sent the funds electronically.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.975
Yes. Yeah, that'll work.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.061
That's it, then.

10:48.232 --> 10:52.945
You know, if this doesn't get Gretta back,
I'm all tapped out.

10:55.739 --> 10:59.785
And this paper, it really is a nice touch.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.626
Patrice!

11:22.933 --> 11:24.268
It's all right.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.601
God!

12:10.522 --> 12:11.857
Emma!

13:31.979 --> 13:33.230
Hey.

13:34.982 --> 13:38.569
Thanks for coming to meet me here.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.866
This place has good memories.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.786
And Emma, she was addicted
to those dumplings,

13:48.662 --> 13:49.955
her whole pregnancy.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.420
I wanna thank you too for--

13:58.130 --> 14:00.090
Helping my mom
with the funeral arrangements.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.718
Brian was my nephew.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.476
Have they been putting fresh flowers
on his grave every week?

14:12.019 --> 14:13.103
We paid extra for that.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.815
I haven't been going. So...

14:16.815 --> 14:18.942
- But you have to--
- I wanted to...

14:21.069 --> 14:23.864
pay you back for what you've done.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.492
What's it? About $10,000 for a birth?

14:27.492 --> 14:28.785
What are you...

14:32.915 --> 14:34.416
You didn't even need me.

14:35.250 --> 14:39.046
Emma did it herself. You did it together.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.966
Yeah, well, you trained us.

14:47.721 --> 14:48.555
Apollo...

14:48.555 --> 14:53.018
I never even got to hear her third wish.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.314
It could've been anything, you know?
She could've--

14:58.023 --> 14:59.608
She could've just told--

15:01.151 --> 15:02.736
I think you should know...

15:09.993 --> 15:11.995
it wasn't supposed to be like this.

15:14.665 --> 15:15.874
This is what it is.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.203
Goodbye, Valentines.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.751
Thank you.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.523
What the fuck? What?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.045
What?

17:06.234 --> 17:07.069
Fuck you!

17:24.461 --> 17:25.628
What?

17:29.341 --> 17:31.176
Where the fuck are you?

17:37.182 --> 17:38.392
William.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.354
Hey! William!

17:43.438 --> 17:44.773
Goddamn it.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.903
- William! Where the fuck are you? Hey!
- Hey. Hey, Mr. Kagwa--

17:49.903 --> 17:51.446
- You little fucking shit!
- Apollo!

17:51.446 --> 17:52.823
Sorry to see you again like this-- No.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.658
- Hey! Oh, come on man.
- The fuck do you think this is?

17:54.658 --> 17:57.327
- This a fucking sick joke to you? Huh?
- No. No.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.746
I didn't mean to get all cloak
and dagger about it. Come on.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.915
What the fuck are you talking about?
Do you know Emma's alive?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.792
- Yes, I do. I swear-- Look--
- What? How?

18:03.792 --> 18:06.253
- I only just found out.
- What the fuck do you mean?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.922
The NYPD
and the fucking Feds couldn't find her,

18:08.922 --> 18:11.508
and you mean to tell me you did?
Is that what you're telling me?

18:11.508 --> 18:13.802
Look, there was a time
when government agencies like that

18:13.802 --> 18:15.637
were the only resource
a person had, Apollo.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.473
- Shut the fuck up with that shit!
- That's not true anymore.

18:19.975 --> 18:23.145
You know, a hundred people with
a hundred computers across the country,

18:23.687 --> 18:25.606
they can cover as much ground as them.

18:25.606 --> 18:26.899
They can cover more.

18:28.025 --> 18:31.069
And if those people really care,
they'll work day and night.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.154
They won't quit.

18:32.905 --> 18:35.574
And that's just what they did
when I told them I wanted to help you.

18:35.574 --> 18:39.161
Okay, okay. So where is she?

18:39.161 --> 18:42.372
If what you say is true,
where is Emma Valentine?

18:43.248 --> 18:44.958
She's on an island in the East River.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.797
- I'm serious. I swear it.
- This fucking guy.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.674
I'm serious.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.261
The Wise Ones, Apollo. I found 'em.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.347
Who are you?

18:59.223 --> 19:02.017
- Apollo, I'm your friend.
- Don't! You're not my fucking friend.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.602
Stop saying that. Stop touching me.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.563
How do I get to her?

19:08.732 --> 19:10.067
You're gonna need a boat.

19:10.901 --> 19:14.112
A fucking boat.
Well, great, I don't have a fucking boat.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.906
Come on, man, relax.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.700
There's an app for that.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.454
Oh, fuck.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.748
- You know this crazy.
- Fuck.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.586
You know what the Library
of Alexandria was in Egypt?

19:29.586 --> 19:32.172
Yeah, I know it. My wife was a librarian.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.590
It held the world's knowledge.

19:33.590 --> 19:38.303
"The place of the cure of the soul."
That's what the Internet is, my man.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.848
Hey, did boat guy
give you any actual evidence

19:40.848 --> 19:42.307
- that Emma was still alive?
- Yeah.

19:42.307 --> 19:46.061
He sent me some kind of file or something,
but I can't open it.

19:46.061 --> 19:49.815
It's probably in Flash, I bet.
Yeah, forward it to me.

19:49.815 --> 19:50.899
Okay.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.735
Good news is I did my due diligence

19:53.735 --> 19:56.113
- on Wheeler before you got here.
- And?

19:56.113 --> 19:59.199
William Webster Wheeler.
Gotta love alliteration.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.742
Born in Levittown.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.871
Owns a house in Forest Hills,
on 86th street.

20:03.871 --> 20:07.082
Served in the Air Force as a programming
specialist in the early '80s.

20:07.082 --> 20:11.003
After that, worked for
the Medical University of South Carolina.

20:11.003 --> 20:15.674
Started making his way back northeast.
Been working as an app developer.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.593
Damn.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.429
- This guy is who he says he is.
- Yeah.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.764
- That means something these days.
- Yeah, he's gonna get a

20:22.764 --> 20:24.224
boat tomorrow night...

20:24.975 --> 20:27.019
Yeah, so why is this guy helping you?

20:27.019 --> 20:29.104
- I mean, what's in it for him?
- I don't know.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.147
Maybe he's fucking crazy.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.733
Maybe he wants to throw me off the boat.
I really don't care.

20:37.905 --> 20:38.947
Yeah.

20:44.745 --> 20:47.414
This looks like CCTV camera footage.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.209
This guy's friends did
some serious digging.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.592
<i>What is a ghost?
The spirit of a dead person,</i>

20:58.592 --> 21:00.093
<i>or a vision seen askew?</i>

21:02.554 --> 21:05.349
<i>Three months since he'd last
seen her alive,</i>

21:05.349 --> 21:08.685
<i>and now here she was.</i>

21:19.696 --> 21:21.198
South Street Seaport.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.891
Thought you didn't know how
to drive a boat.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.311
I can't tell a lie.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.816
<i>Welcome to the wonderful world of boating.</i>

21:55.816 --> 21:57.943
<i>I'm gonna show you how to cast off a dock.</i>

21:57.943 --> 22:00.529
<i>But before I do,
be sure to like and subscribe.</i>

22:00.529 --> 22:03.156
You can learn anything from the Internet.
I'm teaching myself.

22:05.576 --> 22:06.577
Thank you.

22:06.577 --> 22:09.204
Hey, you know,
we can go back whenever you want.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.123
Say the word.

22:14.293 --> 22:15.669
Let me ask you something.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.963
Did you tell anybody else
we were doing this?

22:20.465 --> 22:21.633
I told Patrice.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.139
There's something you need to see then.

22:29.850 --> 22:33.312
- Oh, no. No, not you too.
- Look. Right there.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.357
"Green Hair Harry". There's your Patrice.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.861
- Patrice?
- Yeah. And there's this.

22:40.861 --> 22:43.113
Oh, my God.

22:44.615 --> 22:47.034
Look, I'm sure he meant
to show us support,

22:47.034 --> 22:48.869
but I'm actually out here with you.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.039
Look, we need to be careful.

22:52.039 --> 22:55.083
Vampires can't come into your house
unless you invite them, Apollo.

22:55.876 --> 22:59.588
Posting online is like
leaving your front door wide open

23:00.547 --> 23:03.509
and telling any creature
of the night they can just come right in.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.602
Wow. Rikers.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.437
Lights out.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.472
How would you do it?

23:50.472 --> 23:51.765
Jump off George Washington Bridge.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.113
Shit.

24:36.351 --> 24:39.605
<i>Would you even know if you
crossed into a fairy tale?</i>

24:41.607 --> 24:43.567
<i>Slipped between the pages of a book?</i>

24:48.572 --> 24:53.911
<i>There are portals in this world that we
may never know we've trespassed through.</i>

25:17.267 --> 25:20.812
There. Look, right there. There it is.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.274
Oh, my gosh. You found it.

25:26.818 --> 25:27.819
Yeah, I'm gonna beach us.

25:28.779 --> 25:29.947
Okay.

25:48.215 --> 25:49.216
Ready?

25:49.842 --> 25:50.843
Yes.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.479
It's freezing.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.904
- William.
- Yeah?

26:10.904 --> 26:12.114
Why are you here?

26:16.034 --> 26:17.202
Gretta said no.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.290
She wasn't even mean about it, you know?

26:22.249 --> 26:24.376
She just said to leave the book
for the girls in my will.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.670
If I wasn't out here with you,

26:26.670 --> 26:29.089
I'd just be at home
in my basement, going nuts.

26:29.089 --> 26:32.843
I know this is insane.
At least I'm not alone.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.101
Can I come with you?

26:49.943 --> 26:50.944
Let's roll.

26:51.820 --> 26:52.821
Let's roll.

26:58.911 --> 27:00.495
- Look.
- What?

27:04.458 --> 27:05.459
Hospital beds.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.669
I know where we are.

27:08.754 --> 27:10.881
This must be North Brother Island.
I read about this today.

27:12.591 --> 27:14.551
Yeah,
it was a hospital for the infectious.

27:19.473 --> 27:20.641
Phone died.

27:20.641 --> 27:21.725
Come on, William.

27:22.226 --> 27:23.894
Hey, you know who Mary Mallon was?

27:23.894 --> 27:24.978
Typhoid Mary.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.563
Bingo. You're smart.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.399
The original super-spreader.

27:30.442 --> 27:33.070
You know they quarantined her here
for a third of her life?

27:35.322 --> 27:38.575
Now it's a nesting colony
for the black-crowned night heron.

27:40.202 --> 27:41.203
William!

27:46.250 --> 27:47.960
Hey! Look! Look at that light.

27:48.877 --> 27:52.297
- What is that?
- Holy cannoli. The Wise Ones.

27:52.965 --> 27:55.384
We gotta find out if
these women have weapons and destroy them.

27:55.384 --> 27:58.136
Sabotage their boats.
We could easily take these witches out.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.431
Hey, shut up.
You are a middle-aged IT guy,

28:01.431 --> 28:02.850
and I'm a depressed bookseller.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.354
But I'm the god Apollo.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.567
I am the god Apollo!

28:12.568 --> 28:17.656
Emma! Bitch, where are you? Where are you?

28:19.283 --> 28:25.080
Where are you? Emma! I am the god Apollo!

28:25.581 --> 28:27.749
I am the god Apollo!

28:28.667 --> 28:33.088
I am the god Apollo!
I come for my revenge!

28:33.672 --> 28:39.219
Emma, where are you? Where are you?

28:42.806 --> 28:43.932
Stop!

28:57.779 --> 29:00.032
Let me go. Let me go.

29:01.283 --> 29:03.368
No, no. Let me go.

29:08.415 --> 29:09.791
I'm here for my wife!

29:20.719 --> 29:22.012
Fuck!

29:40.822 --> 29:44.451
<i>When it falls off my wrist,
those three wishes will come true.</i>

29:44.451 --> 29:46.411
<i>I am the god Apollo.</i>

29:46.411 --> 29:50.666
<i>Não corta</i>. Do not cut it.

29:53.293 --> 29:54.586
It's not a baby.

29:54.586 --> 30:00.425
Hey. No matter what happens,
you're coming with me.

30:01.802 --> 30:07.349
<i>Coming with me. Coming with me.</i>

30:13.480 --> 30:14.565
Stop! Stop!

30:19.236 --> 30:20.487
Get off me!

30:20.487 --> 30:25.158
Why do you protect Emma? Why do you
protect her? She killed my baby!

30:25.158 --> 30:26.827
She killed my baby!

30:27.327 --> 30:28.370
You're Emma's?

30:28.954 --> 30:31.248
Of course he is.
Emma was a pain in the ass.

30:31.248 --> 30:32.541
Why wouldn't the husband be too?

30:32.541 --> 30:34.084
Cal will wanna see you.

30:34.960 --> 30:35.878
- Come on.
- Cal?

30:35.878 --> 30:38.255
Cal told me how to get my daughter back.

30:38.255 --> 30:43.010
Cal told me what to do.
I just don't know if I can do it.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.094
Cal?

30:45.721 --> 30:46.680
Come on.

30:52.769 --> 30:53.770
Get off of me!

30:53.770 --> 30:59.443
Get-- Let me go!

31:00.652 --> 31:01.653
Let me go!

31:13.582 --> 31:14.750
It's not a baby.

31:15.584 --> 31:17.085
Hey, hey, wait!

31:18.420 --> 31:19.421
I know her.

31:34.853 --> 31:36.271
It fell in the courtyard.

31:36.271 --> 31:38.482
One of the children
found it and brought it to me.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.068
I thought I trained you
to be more careful.

31:41.068 --> 31:42.152
I'm sorry.

31:42.736 --> 31:43.737
Sloppy.

31:56.792 --> 31:57.876
Which is more frightening?

32:01.630 --> 32:02.673
Hello?

32:04.299 --> 32:05.968
They didn't cut out your tongue, did they?

32:06.927 --> 32:07.928
You're Cal.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.766
Yeah, it's short for Calisto. Come closer.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.646
They're protective of me.

32:18.647 --> 32:21.233
You're not gonna do anything dumb,
are you?

32:27.906 --> 32:29.575
I'm putting on a show tomorrow
for the kids.

32:29.575 --> 32:32.160
Come, help me make a frightening puppet.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.581
Hey, hey! Where is my wife?

32:35.581 --> 32:40.460
Once upon a time, an old man
and a woman had long wished for a child.

32:40.961 --> 32:42.671
And once pregnant,

32:42.671 --> 32:46.967
the wife gazed longingly at a field
of rapunzel greens next door.

32:46.967 --> 32:50.721
So her husband decided
to steal some for her.

32:50.721 --> 32:54.057
But a terrifying enchantress appeared
and said,

32:54.057 --> 32:58.478
"How dare you, you thief!
I will curse you."

32:59.396 --> 33:02.816
But she agreed
that she would spare his life

33:03.317 --> 33:06.737
if they gave her their baby.

33:06.737 --> 33:08.238
Enough. Stop.

33:09.364 --> 33:12.034
Listen, I need to know where my wife is.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.828
Hey, where is my wife?

33:14.828 --> 33:18.332
I need to find her, all right?
Your whatever tried to kill me.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.250
You know, years ago, a husband found us.

33:21.752 --> 33:26.673
He brought with him two guns and
a ton of rage.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.760
I made the mistake of
trying to talk to him.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.763
But he killed
three women and seven children.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.892
That's when we left the world
and we came here.

33:37.976 --> 33:40.229
And we armed ourselves
as best as we could.

33:40.229 --> 33:45.192
And when men show up,
we're just a little more proactive.

33:52.324 --> 33:53.784
How many men did you kill?

33:55.327 --> 33:56.745
Who knows? We're like the police.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.163
We don't keep track of those numbers.

34:00.290 --> 34:02.251
So, how do we protect our children?

34:03.293 --> 34:06.713
That's what <i>Rapunzel</i> is all about.
That's the question that it's asking.

34:06.713 --> 34:09.174
Well, clearly,
I'm the wrong person to ask.

34:11.592 --> 34:16.223
You know, the husband,
he protects himself over the baby.

34:16.223 --> 34:17.641
The baby gets snatched.

34:18.559 --> 34:19.893
And then the enchantress,

34:19.893 --> 34:21.895
I mean, she won't let that kid go
anywhere in the world.

34:21.895 --> 34:24.313
She's like a helicopter parent.

34:24.313 --> 34:30.404
And still, that prince, he manages
to find a way inside.

34:31.612 --> 34:34.116
I mean, no matter what we do,
the world finds a way in.

34:36.827 --> 34:39.621
So, how do we protect our children?

34:41.706 --> 34:44.877
That's a question that has been asked
for hundreds of years,

34:44.877 --> 34:48.130
ever since fairy tales were first told
around an evening fire.

34:50.340 --> 34:54.303
The new fears are the old fears,
and the old fears are ancient.

34:54.303 --> 34:59.725
But when it's our turn to face them,
they are made new.

35:16.700 --> 35:21.079
The children will talk to this puppet
as if it were as real as me.

35:26.502 --> 35:28.921
It's an old kind of magic.

35:29.796 --> 35:32.591
The Scottish called it "glamour."

35:32.591 --> 35:37.221
It's an illusion where something pretends
to be something other than it is.

35:37.804 --> 35:41.725
A monster looks to be a beautiful maiden,

35:41.725 --> 35:45.312
and a ruined castle appears
as a golden palace.

35:46.396 --> 35:50.150
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

35:53.028 --> 35:54.321
It's not a baby.

35:54.905 --> 35:57.032
That's a smart boy.

36:00.118 --> 36:03.497
But if it's an illusion,

36:03.497 --> 36:05.582
that means there's someone
that created it.

36:05.582 --> 36:09.920
- Hello! Are you in there?
- Shit.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.130
You didn't come alone!

36:38.448 --> 36:39.783
Hey, easy.

36:54.381 --> 36:55.883
What was he doing when you found him?

36:55.883 --> 36:59.344
He was on the shore, waving his
phone light over his head, side to side.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.054
It was dead. The phone was dead.

37:01.054 --> 37:03.140
Why the fuck haven't you destroyed
this thing yet?

37:03.849 --> 37:05.976
I thought you'd like to see
what he has on it.

37:14.151 --> 37:15.235
William.

37:15.235 --> 37:19.489
Oh, my God. This is Gretta's husband.

37:51.772 --> 37:54.525
Yeah, we should call her.
She'll wanna be here when we kill him.

37:54.525 --> 37:57.277
Gretta? Please, I'd love to see her.

37:57.277 --> 37:58.737
That's not gonna happen.

38:13.001 --> 38:14.670
Shit. Okay, okay.

38:21.510 --> 38:26.014
And you, you better decide if you're ready
to eat a large slice of humble pie.

38:40.821 --> 38:44.741
Wait. I don't know what's--

38:55.544 --> 38:56.545
Fuck.

38:57.963 --> 38:59.673
Well, at least I got my glasses back.

39:02.342 --> 39:05.053
How are you not dead, man?

39:14.396 --> 39:15.939
You haven't told me everything.

39:19.401 --> 39:20.736
Well, obviously.

39:23.989 --> 39:27.701
They fucking tried to kill me, man.
They tried to kill me.

39:28.243 --> 39:30.829
Yeah. Yeah, and I'm sorry about that.

39:31.705 --> 39:35.459
But if I'm honest,
I didn't think we'd make it this far.

39:36.084 --> 39:38.921
You know, I've been up and down this river
for months and couldn't find the place.

39:38.921 --> 39:42.841
You went and spotted it on your first try. Lucky.

39:42.841 --> 39:46.345
Wait. If you've been up
and down looking for this place,

39:46.845 --> 39:48.388
you didn't learn
how to drive a boat today.

39:50.265 --> 39:51.642
Well, my family's Norwegian.

39:52.726 --> 39:55.479
Heck, I've been on boats
since I was a baby.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.773
Sailing's just kind of in our blood.

39:57.773 --> 39:59.566
Why would you keep that from me, man?

40:00.817 --> 40:01.902
Doesn't make any sense.

40:08.534 --> 40:10.285
What the fuck is going on, man?

40:11.954 --> 40:12.955
Who are you?

40:13.997 --> 40:18.585
Okay. Okay. I have a confession to make.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.464
I knew who you were before we met.

40:27.427 --> 40:28.846
- What?
- Yeah.

40:30.222 --> 40:32.599
Yeah, I read about your wife
giving birth on the A train.

40:34.434 --> 40:35.811
I just knew.

40:36.436 --> 40:37.354
Just knew what?

40:37.354 --> 40:39.022
That we were gonna be friends.

40:39.982 --> 40:42.985
Oh, my God. This motherfucker is crazy.

40:45.028 --> 40:48.657
This motherfucker is crazy.
Batshit fucking crazy, aren't you?

40:48.657 --> 40:51.827
No, I just loved the story about how Brian
came into the world so much.

40:52.786 --> 40:54.454
You know how you hear about someone
on the news,

40:54.454 --> 40:57.249
so you look them up on the Internet
to see what their life is like now?

40:58.250 --> 40:59.918
Well, I just wanted to see the baby.

41:01.086 --> 41:04.339
And I wanted to find a happy ending
where there was none in my own home.

41:05.549 --> 41:08.051
Let me ask you something. Are you happy?

41:08.051 --> 41:09.845
Are you happy with
my fucking happy ending?

41:09.845 --> 41:12.264
You know, I found you
through all your social media accounts.

41:13.473 --> 41:14.641
Early mornings in the park.

41:15.726 --> 41:17.102
All those pictures you posted.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.481
You were so happy.
And I thought to myself, "I love this guy.

41:22.149 --> 41:25.777
You know, he really gets it. He's doing it
exactly the way I should have done it."

41:25.777 --> 41:29.239
Gretta ran off with my daughter
and destroyed my family, but you--

41:30.199 --> 41:32.367
You were a beacon of what it could be.

41:33.410 --> 41:36.955
Daughter? You have two daughters.

41:38.707 --> 41:39.708
No, I had two.

41:41.460 --> 41:45.380
And then Gretta listened to Cal,
just like Emma did, and she--

41:49.718 --> 41:51.053
I called in the cavalry.

41:51.053 --> 41:54.014
What is that?
What is that, man, the police?

41:55.140 --> 41:56.975
Look, Emma is alive, maybe.

41:57.601 --> 42:00.103
The women on this island
aren't gonna help you find her.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.648
But I can help you.

42:03.690 --> 42:04.775
If you help me.

42:04.775 --> 42:07.986
No, no. Why the fuck would I do that?

42:07.986 --> 42:10.364
After all we've just been through, man,
why the fuck would I do that?

42:10.364 --> 42:12.032
Just help me get Gretta and Grace back.

42:12.032 --> 42:15.536
Well, you heard Cal. They're gonna bring
her here. Help me and I can help you.

42:15.536 --> 42:17.538
Well, you've learned how resourceful I am.

42:17.538 --> 42:19.373
I don't know what the fuck
I've learned about you.

42:20.541 --> 42:23.460
I don't even know who you are
or what the fuck is going on.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.505
I don't know-- I don't know anything, man.
I don't know what the fuck this is.

42:26.505 --> 42:29.758
Please, just talk to Gretta
before they do whatever they're gonna do.

42:29.758 --> 42:31.885
William,
I don't know if you've noticed this,

42:32.386 --> 42:36.723
but I'm in a fucking cage too
with your fucking weird ass!

42:38.308 --> 42:40.394
Well, Cal said she'd kill me and she will,

42:40.978 --> 42:42.604
but she offered you
a chance to eat your pie.

42:43.647 --> 42:45.399
You know,
if you could just talk to Gretta,

42:45.399 --> 42:49.278
explain to her.
I understand it's not her fault.

42:49.862 --> 42:52.239
You know, we both lost our minds
after Agnes died.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.412
That was our baby.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.332
You know, I haven't said her name
out loud in a year.

43:04.376 --> 43:05.377
Agnes.

43:06.795 --> 43:07.796
My sweet girl.

43:09.673 --> 43:11.341
Tell her I know it wasn't her fault.

43:13.177 --> 43:15.929
Tell her I wanna beg for her forgiveness
and offer her mine if she wants it.

43:15.929 --> 43:18.599
- Shut the fuck up. All right.
- I want her and Grace to come home.

43:18.599 --> 43:19.558
All right, all right.

43:19.558 --> 43:21.393
I want what's left of my family
to be whole again.

43:21.393 --> 43:24.271
- I'm just asking you to tell her that.
- All right. Shut up, man.

43:24.980 --> 43:27.274
What makes you think I'm gonna see Gretta
before you do?

43:27.274 --> 43:29.276
Just eat the fucking pie, man!

43:29.902 --> 43:31.403
Just get to my wife.

43:33.780 --> 43:35.199
You're the only chance I have left.

43:37.242 --> 43:38.827
I don't wanna die here without trying.

43:44.541 --> 43:45.792
What if I say no?

43:46.502 --> 43:48.420
If I say, "Fuck you. Fuck all of this"?

43:49.880 --> 43:51.089
Then what?

43:53.425 --> 43:54.635
You don't get it.

43:59.723 --> 44:04.728
Apollo, if you don't help me,

44:04.728 --> 44:07.064
everyone on this island is going to die.
