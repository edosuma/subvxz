OPUS PICTURES present

00:23.076 --> 00:28.076
A BA ENTERTAINMENT production

00:56.848 --> 01:05.221
LIFE RISKING ROMANCE

02:32.504 --> 02:34.129
What do we do now?

02:36.504 --> 02:37.629
Chop it up.

02:37.837 --> 02:39.921
Torso at work,

02:40.477 --> 02:44.896
and bury the head in the front yard.

02:45.295 --> 02:48.961
It’ll be cathartic seeing
the head every morning.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.380
Ms. Byeon, that’s a killer idea.

02:53.896 --> 02:56.493
But it’d be a bit wasteful

02:58.030 --> 02:59.571
just to chop it up.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.545
Is there another way?

03:13.796 --> 03:14.837
Wait.

03:16.292 --> 03:17.868
Did you hear something?

04:03.400 --> 04:04.732
Who are you?!

04:08.696 --> 04:10.322
Stay back!

04:10.347 --> 04:13.375
Hey, Jane!
What are you doing here?!

04:14.213 --> 04:15.545
Jane!

04:15.671 --> 04:17.375
Police! Freeze!

04:19.399 --> 04:21.469
You’re under arrest
for murder and…

04:36.459 --> 04:40.833
The interior fits the crime novel
publisher’s office.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.754
This doll is so lifelike.

04:47.545 --> 04:49.921
Sergeant, what are you doing?

04:50.796 --> 04:54.571
This is for our best writer.

04:54.891 --> 04:56.350
No pictures please.

04:57.269 --> 05:00.936
She’s Korea’s Conan Doyle,
Ms. Byeon So-jeong.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.748
It was a simulation
to understand a killer.

05:04.773 --> 05:08.398
It’s crucial for a writer to
become one with the character.

05:10.327 --> 05:13.910
And a pseudo-writer sees it
and makes a false report.

05:15.274 --> 05:19.104
You thought I was
having an affair with her?

05:19.269 --> 05:23.727
And plot to kidnap and
kill my wife for insurance?

05:27.212 --> 05:30.414
I’m asking just in case...

05:31.662 --> 05:33.787
Did you tell my wife?

05:35.962 --> 05:38.087
I don’t believe it!

05:39.296 --> 05:41.421
Jane, I’m gonna sue you!

05:41.941 --> 05:45.274
She’s not a writer,
she hasn’t published in years!

05:46.421 --> 05:47.713
Your hands.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.019
She won’t flee, no need cuff her.

05:55.044 --> 05:59.641
No way, she’s a town nuisance,
a serial false reporter!

05:59.666 --> 06:02.625
- Cuff her feet too.
- Huh? Town nuisance?

06:07.340 --> 06:08.549
Hey, honey.

06:08.899 --> 06:12.625
A suspect farted,
it was like diarrhea gas.

06:13.129 --> 06:15.504
Sorry, you were eating?

06:15.884 --> 06:16.884
Get in.

06:23.321 --> 06:24.738
He’s coming,
look sad.

06:26.212 --> 06:30.337
You were caught red-handed,
that’s 3 years!

06:31.871 --> 06:34.912
If you weren’t a contractual writer!

06:35.766 --> 06:38.642
I’ll repay you with a great book.

06:38.667 --> 06:39.479
Forget it!

06:39.504 --> 06:42.087
If you don’t bring me an idea in a month,

06:42.087 --> 06:44.805
first draft in 6 months,
published in 1 year,

06:44.921 --> 06:47.356
I’ll really sue you
for breach of contract!

06:47.381 --> 06:49.757
We signed so long ago!

06:49.782 --> 06:53.852
I don’t even want a bestseller,
just bring one good idea!

07:00.254 --> 07:02.813
You report a butcher shop
for selling human meat,

07:02.838 --> 07:05.337
a tattoo artist for being in a gang.

07:05.921 --> 07:08.337
Keep it up and you’ll be
forced out of town!

07:08.986 --> 07:10.611
Whatever.

07:12.212 --> 07:15.782
And go to a clinic,
it’s really bad.

07:15.807 --> 07:18.558
For reporting a potential suspect?

07:18.583 --> 07:20.250
No, your fart!

07:20.275 --> 07:22.900
It’s irritable bowel syndrome for sure!

07:22.925 --> 07:27.175
I just need to write a book!
It’s stress-related.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.883
I don’t have any ideas, not one!

07:30.191 --> 07:31.358
Hey, Jane.

07:31.671 --> 07:33.880
I was actually thinking about that.

07:33.946 --> 07:37.363
Mind your business
and catch the serial killer.

07:37.388 --> 07:39.805
That’s what I’m referring to!

07:40.504 --> 07:43.227
Base your new book on
the Itaewon serial killer.

07:43.252 --> 07:45.368
The case is open,
so it’s media-friendly.

07:48.463 --> 07:49.921
Go on.

07:51.191 --> 07:54.067
Let’s go camping
over the long weekend.

07:54.618 --> 07:57.629
We can come up with great ideas!

07:57.934 --> 07:59.351
- Camping?
- Yeah.

07:59.824 --> 08:01.852
Why pay money
to be a homeless?

08:02.848 --> 08:05.250
And why should I go with you?

08:05.588 --> 08:08.921
Who else then? Huh?

08:11.155 --> 08:13.780
A man who looks stylish in a suit,

08:14.230 --> 08:16.855
full lips that’s perfect for kissing.

08:17.098 --> 08:19.597
Your perfect man doesn’t exist.

08:21.696 --> 08:25.154
But you’re not it.

08:25.904 --> 08:26.654
What?

08:27.280 --> 08:30.737
Where you going?
You got a report to fill!

08:32.659 --> 08:33.857
Could you do it for me?

08:33.883 --> 08:35.216
Not this time!

08:36.083 --> 08:37.712
I’ve been doing that for you.

08:37.736 --> 08:41.154
You're cuffing me
enough times today.

08:47.677 --> 08:52.011
Ms. Han, stop right there!
That’s enough.

08:52.238 --> 08:53.737
Please stop.

08:53.762 --> 08:56.086
Buddy! Can’t you do it for me?!

08:56.113 --> 08:57.860
Hey, Jane Han!

08:57.885 --> 09:00.086
They have a weird relationship.

09:00.111 --> 09:02.727
Stop that thief!
Handcuff thief!

09:02.904 --> 09:05.654
‘Thief’? That’s too much!

09:12.683 --> 09:14.933
A man who looks stylish in a suit,

09:14.958 --> 09:17.457
full lips that’s perfect for kissing

09:17.779 --> 09:20.487
Your perfect man doesn’t exist.

09:21.599 --> 09:24.307
He's right here...

09:24.622 --> 09:25.706
Who the hell?

09:26.805 --> 09:28.485
Let go of her!

09:29.297 --> 09:30.930
Let her go!

09:41.696 --> 09:43.112
Let go of her!

09:43.971 --> 09:46.213
Who the hell are you?!

09:46.238 --> 09:48.362
Can anyone tell me
what's going on here?

09:49.283 --> 09:50.450
I just wanted to help.

09:50.779 --> 09:52.445
I thought you were
chasing a criminal.

09:52.571 --> 09:54.946
No, you have done nothing wrong.

09:55.946 --> 09:57.362
That was all our fault.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.740
Anyway, I apologize.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.657
What the heck is he saying?

10:02.682 --> 10:04.306
Just say ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you’.

10:07.623 --> 10:08.790
Sorry, thank you.

10:09.262 --> 10:10.012
Me too.

10:33.476 --> 10:35.352
There goes your chance.

10:35.904 --> 10:37.362
Here comes insecurity.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.029
Shut it.

10:52.299 --> 10:55.341
I’m jealous,
she met her perfect man.

10:59.177 --> 11:04.469
Lord, if you allow us to meet again,

11:05.529 --> 11:08.961
I’ll attend church regularly.

11:15.612 --> 11:18.113
You startled me.

11:19.897 --> 11:22.758
Was I in your way?

11:32.261 --> 11:33.428
Are you…

11:34.404 --> 11:35.904
Hur Jong-gu?

11:38.821 --> 11:40.571
You are him!

11:42.575 --> 11:43.917
How do you know my name?

11:43.942 --> 11:48.318
Well, where do I know you from?

11:51.321 --> 11:53.141
MOST WANTED:
HUR JONG-GU (36)

11:54.731 --> 11:55.838
I… I’m sorry.

11:55.863 --> 11:59.180
I mistook you
for a church friend.

12:10.079 --> 12:11.399
Anyone home?!

12:46.946 --> 12:48.321
Sher Lok

12:52.420 --> 12:56.046
House at the end of alley!

12:56.071 --> 12:57.904
I found Hur Jong-gu!

13:10.519 --> 13:13.977
Could you look the other way?

13:17.340 --> 13:18.250
Jane.

13:18.813 --> 13:19.868
Lok-Han!

13:20.238 --> 13:23.186
What now?
You got a report to write.

13:23.211 --> 13:25.171
Hur Jong-gu,
2 larceny convictions,

13:25.625 --> 13:27.250
expert at fleeing.

13:28.352 --> 13:31.110
I’m sorry, she’s a bit…

13:31.742 --> 13:33.909
Sir, please calm down!

13:34.788 --> 13:38.250
Put the knife down and let’s talk.

13:38.457 --> 13:40.082
Freeze!

13:42.305 --> 13:43.754
- Stop right there!
- Hey!

13:43.779 --> 13:45.243
Hey! Hey!

13:46.578 --> 13:48.796
You could’ve died
if it wasn’t me.

13:48.821 --> 13:50.487
You didn’t even know him.

13:51.196 --> 13:54.171
At least remember names
on the wanted posters.

13:54.196 --> 13:57.029
By the way,
why’s there a suitcase?

14:04.172 --> 14:08.196
Suitcase in a vacant house
could only mean a body.

14:28.338 --> 14:30.772
There’s nothing to see here,
please head back home.

14:30.797 --> 14:31.796
What?

14:32.063 --> 14:34.805
No problem, no problem.
Come back home!

14:34.907 --> 14:37.196
Go back home, you idiot!

14:37.238 --> 14:38.836
You bastard!

14:39.467 --> 14:41.539
Salute! On duty!
Nothing to report!

14:41.564 --> 14:45.329
I’ve had it with you!
Is this nothing?!

14:45.404 --> 14:47.582
Then why the hell
am I here?!

14:47.607 --> 14:49.850
- We’ll rectify!
- You call yourself a cop?

14:49.875 --> 14:53.524
You let a suspect to flee
and tamper with evidence?!

14:53.950 --> 14:56.117
What a stupid moron!

14:56.945 --> 14:59.571
3-month suspension or a transfer to the province,

14:59.696 --> 15:00.821
take your pick!

15:00.945 --> 15:03.422
This is CBL’s Yum Chul-ho!

15:03.653 --> 15:07.879
I’m at the scene,
where third body was found,

15:07.904 --> 15:12.571
and the police declared
Hur as the prime suspect,

15:13.039 --> 15:14.920
and sent out a national APB.

15:14.945 --> 15:17.571
Itaewon Serial Killing Case.

15:17.893 --> 15:21.810
Victims were naked inside
a suitcase in vacant homes.

15:22.154 --> 15:25.780
They were strangled with
a unique belt buckle.

15:26.237 --> 15:30.696
Victims exhibit no signs of
resistance or sexual assault.

15:30.780 --> 15:33.117
If they did not resist,

15:33.829 --> 15:37.610
it’d only mean
they felt at ease with him.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.930
Are you serious?!
Damn you, Windows 98!

16:18.088 --> 16:19.704
Don’t kill me…

16:22.571 --> 16:23.987
Please…

16:28.344 --> 16:32.936
Emergency Dispatch,
hello again, Ms. Jane Han!

16:32.961 --> 16:35.406
A woman is being murdered.

16:35.431 --> 16:38.548
Very good, you sound drunk.
You should hit the sack.

16:38.573 --> 16:40.227
Please stop calling!

16:40.523 --> 16:42.273
It’s for real!

16:43.477 --> 16:47.820
Hello? Hello?

16:49.101 --> 16:51.936
A woman is dying!

16:55.279 --> 16:57.945
Jane

17:00.883 --> 17:03.633
He never answers
when it’s urgent!

17:18.093 --> 17:21.093
Fine, no one will believe me?

17:26.237 --> 17:30.154
Can I really catch a killer?

18:00.488 --> 18:04.112
Food leaflet, you bastard!

18:04.708 --> 18:07.542
Jane, what are you doing?

18:08.315 --> 18:09.148
Hey!

18:09.563 --> 18:11.438
Jane, come on out!

18:11.862 --> 18:13.904
She’s not answering at all.

18:14.352 --> 18:15.686
Are you nervous?

18:15.711 --> 18:18.820
Just sleep with her already.
Get out of the friend zone.

18:19.797 --> 18:23.141
Tonight’s the chance,
birthday is a weakness.

18:23.578 --> 18:27.678
One kiss is your ticket
out of the friend zone.

18:27.703 --> 18:29.248
Stay out of my affairs!

18:29.273 --> 18:29.940
Move!

18:35.847 --> 18:38.888
Friends don’t have
each other’s keys.

18:42.174 --> 18:43.133
Jane!

18:45.196 --> 18:45.696
Jane!

18:45.922 --> 18:46.946
Jane, wake up!

18:46.971 --> 18:49.721
Dude, perform CPR,
give it a go.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.958
Open airway, check breath!

18:52.232 --> 18:53.797
I don’t think she’s breathing.

18:53.863 --> 18:55.529
2 rescue breaths!

19:07.029 --> 19:08.696
No, no!

19:08.943 --> 19:11.693
Your chance is slipping!

19:13.071 --> 19:13.863
Okay.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.321
Chest compresses.

19:16.404 --> 19:18.529
Right on her boobs?

19:40.289 --> 19:41.914
Serial killing in progress!

19:42.904 --> 19:44.529
Killer lives upstairs!

19:44.821 --> 19:47.071
I have to up there
before the evidence is gone.

19:47.238 --> 19:48.899
Let go of me first!

19:51.362 --> 19:54.029
Strangulation and the luggage,
it’s the same method.

19:54.529 --> 19:56.789
You only heard it.

19:57.394 --> 19:59.352
But I’m 100% sure!

19:59.779 --> 20:01.430
Nobody’s home!

20:04.779 --> 20:07.779
Traces of the combination
should still be there.

20:10.362 --> 20:13.571
You idiot! We can’t enter
without a warrant!

20:15.904 --> 20:17.029
A warrant?

20:18.385 --> 20:21.625
Warrants aren’t given away
as birthday presents.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.328
Happy birthday, Jane!

20:33.115 --> 20:36.000
Who still uses Windows 98?

20:36.071 --> 20:36.988
Here.

20:42.578 --> 20:44.821
Sher Lok-Han!
I’m so moved!

20:44.846 --> 20:47.679
You should stop reporting
and start writing.

20:48.393 --> 20:49.501
Yeah, Jane.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.289
It’s not right this time.

20:52.008 --> 20:53.970
You mean,
it’s not this time either.

20:53.995 --> 20:55.036
You douchebags!

20:55.349 --> 20:56.266
Listen!

20:56.411 --> 20:58.578
I’m sure this time!

20:59.654 --> 21:02.904
Bae is coming tonight,
so I’m gonna take off.

21:04.519 --> 21:07.477
The boyfriend
who studies abroad?

21:07.502 --> 21:10.961
I gotta cook, and get ready
for a steamy night.

21:16.154 --> 21:18.113
I just tried it out.

21:18.113 --> 21:21.946
Taking something
without asking is stealing.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.946
What are you doing tonight?

21:29.404 --> 21:31.071
I’m free thanks to
my suspension.

21:31.821 --> 21:33.946
How about a steamy night too?

21:34.113 --> 21:35.188
Pervert!

21:37.529 --> 21:40.071
I’ll kill you
if I ever see you!

21:45.841 --> 21:51.000
Your girlfriend won’t be happy
to know you’re here this often.

21:52.708 --> 21:53.584
Hey!

21:56.654 --> 21:58.446
I think I met you before.

21:58.446 --> 22:00.404
Yeah, I know.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.363
What brings you here?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.987
I live upstairs, #602.

22:06.862 --> 22:10.625
Upstairs? #602?

22:10.696 --> 22:12.363
I just moved here.

22:12.388 --> 22:14.610
Sorry if I was
too loud yesterday.

22:14.945 --> 22:16.404
Ah, yes...

22:17.488 --> 22:19.696
I usually watch movies while showering.

22:19.696 --> 22:21.904
So sorry about the noise.

22:22.696 --> 22:23.446
See you.

22:30.352 --> 22:32.437
Isn’t that your perfect man?

22:32.462 --> 22:33.504
He lives here?

22:33.741 --> 22:34.617
Yeah…

22:35.571 --> 22:38.654
The serial killer upstairs…

22:41.552 --> 22:44.843
Use that imagination
to write your book.

22:47.404 --> 22:50.279
I got a surefire idea
for a crime novel!

22:50.559 --> 22:55.476
So you’re gonna write about
the Itaewon serial killer?

22:55.501 --> 22:56.251
Yup!

22:57.321 --> 22:58.196
Go on.

22:58.914 --> 23:00.997
A woman is murdered,

23:01.154 --> 23:04.696
and a novelist living downstairs
witnesses the crime.

23:05.488 --> 23:11.112
But no one, including the cops,
will believe her.

23:12.288 --> 23:14.205
- Because!
- Because?

23:14.279 --> 23:19.571
She cried wolf one too many times,
and reported everyone in town.

23:19.987 --> 23:23.953
That writer reported me too,
the Itaewon nuisance.

23:30.039 --> 23:34.279
Catch the killer
by following the story rules…

23:36.396 --> 23:40.188
Jane Han’s spectacular comeback!

23:41.363 --> 23:44.654
100% true crime,
extreme suspense,

23:44.921 --> 23:46.463
thrillers!

23:46.558 --> 23:49.558
So the novelist
and the killer fall in love?

23:50.685 --> 23:51.435
Huh?

23:52.862 --> 23:54.446
But love is overkill…

23:54.537 --> 23:57.912
She must use love
to get close to him!

23:58.196 --> 24:01.469
It’s the easiest way
to get to the killer!

24:05.664 --> 24:09.980
This will be a big hit
at the book launch party!

24:18.445 --> 24:22.112
- But, boss.
- Yeah?

24:22.529 --> 24:27.901
What if I capture
the real serial killer?

24:33.636 --> 24:37.469
You’ll be a bestselling writer,
like Ms. Byeon.

24:40.738 --> 24:42.446
Like Byeon, eh?

24:42.571 --> 24:43.571
Think about it.

24:43.904 --> 24:48.237
A crime writer catches a real killer,
and turns it into a novel.

24:48.613 --> 24:51.987
Wouldn’t you be curious to read it?

24:54.237 --> 24:57.776
As if crying wolf isn’t enough,
you’ll go on a hunt?

24:57.821 --> 25:00.347
Why don’t you
just call the police?

25:02.654 --> 25:06.227
Even you don’t believe me,
so what’s the use?

25:06.252 --> 25:10.245
Itaewon Serial Killing Case HQ

25:12.529 --> 25:14.738
Isn’t Hur the prime suspect?

25:15.925 --> 25:17.463
He’s not it.

25:17.488 --> 25:20.144
Look at his face,
doesn’t look like a killer.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.660
He does look like
a criminal though.

25:25.326 --> 25:29.701
He looks cute, very manly too.

25:30.245 --> 25:31.188
Hur’s not it.

25:31.213 --> 25:35.463
Larceny never translates
into serial killing.

25:35.488 --> 25:38.613
First victim on Aug. 20,
second on Sep. 11,

25:38.613 --> 25:40.404
and third on Sep. 24.

25:40.429 --> 25:43.034
This is the killer’s safe zone.

25:43.901 --> 25:45.808
Either the killer is in here,

25:46.469 --> 25:50.504
or he dumps the body within
7 days in a vacant home.

25:50.529 --> 25:55.979
#602 moved in recently,
he might not know this area well.

25:56.121 --> 25:57.167
Not at all.

25:57.339 --> 26:02.696
While searching for his home,
he must’ve seen all vacants here.

26:03.325 --> 26:05.441
You feeling it?

26:05.466 --> 26:06.925
He likes dimsum.

26:09.383 --> 26:10.800
I love it too.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.601
Huh? FBI?

26:12.770 --> 26:15.613
Most serial killers dream of
becoming the law.

26:15.722 --> 26:20.715
Domination, manipulation and control
are all common traits of serial killers.

26:20.740 --> 26:21.532
I got it.

26:22.113 --> 26:26.129
#602 wants to become
an FBI agent.

26:26.154 --> 26:29.463
#602? Jason Chen,
the Chinese-American!

26:29.488 --> 26:32.121
He arrived early August, maybe.

26:32.431 --> 26:35.848
He wanted a room for 2 months,
for some seminar.

26:37.190 --> 26:39.190
I wonder what Jane Han’s up to!

26:39.922 --> 26:42.254
You reported me as a kidnapper!

26:42.279 --> 26:43.949
It was a misunderstanding.

26:45.030 --> 26:49.480
He’s got the expensive suite,
he must be loaded.

26:56.057 --> 26:57.597
What are you doing here?

26:58.125 --> 27:00.121
Don’t get wet.
You’ll catch a cold.

27:02.446 --> 27:03.487
See you.

27:05.987 --> 27:08.404
Jason Chen, early 30s.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.521
His hometown Miami has
an open serial killing case,

27:11.546 --> 27:14.421
that is very similar to the Itaewon case.

27:14.446 --> 27:16.780
After arriving in Korea in August,

27:16.805 --> 27:18.793
the killings in Miami stopped,

27:18.818 --> 27:22.527
and bodies with similar traits
showed up in Itaewon.

27:23.196 --> 27:25.321
Could it be a coincidence?

27:25.446 --> 27:28.699
Found in vacant homes,
Asian women,

27:28.904 --> 27:30.071
suitcase…

27:30.096 --> 27:32.679
Unique belt buckle?

27:33.821 --> 27:35.097
It’s Jason!

27:35.729 --> 27:36.771
Jesus H. Christ!

27:36.796 --> 27:38.879
I’ve never seen six-pack in person.

27:38.904 --> 27:40.904
Amazing…

27:41.363 --> 27:44.029
If you eat chicken breast
and do sit-ups,

27:44.029 --> 27:46.129
anyone can have it!

27:46.638 --> 27:49.746
If so, then where’s yours?

27:50.323 --> 27:51.282
Give it.

27:55.550 --> 27:59.043
I’ve never seen
such perfect curves!

27:59.068 --> 28:00.818
Amazing!

28:04.644 --> 28:06.847
It’s the push-up bra.

28:06.872 --> 28:09.363
She pushed up
even her baby fat.

28:12.230 --> 28:14.168
Isn’t that your bra?

28:14.545 --> 28:16.877
When did she steal that?

28:18.410 --> 28:20.988
Buddy, I’ve had it!

28:21.188 --> 28:22.534
Come here!

28:24.945 --> 28:27.714
This is considered assault.

28:28.183 --> 28:30.283
2 years in prison,
$5,000 fine.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.385
Sexual harassment for you,
1 year in prison, $7,000 fine!

28:33.410 --> 28:35.657
Private property damage,
conspiracy to commit a crime,

28:35.682 --> 28:37.675
maximum of 3 years!

28:43.188 --> 28:44.813
It’s open!

28:51.746 --> 28:55.271
Jesus… He even has
autopsy photos.

28:55.296 --> 28:57.171
Illegal search, 5 years.

28:57.171 --> 28:59.339
That’s 8 years in total!

28:59.941 --> 29:00.691
Buddy!

29:01.296 --> 29:03.707
Stop yapping and pop the trunk.

29:11.796 --> 29:12.921
Hello?

29:15.171 --> 29:17.879
I’m in Seoul for a seminar.

29:21.712 --> 29:22.921
Lok-Han!

29:23.254 --> 29:24.462
It’s Jason!

29:25.296 --> 29:26.504
Come here!

29:26.963 --> 29:28.229
What do we do?!

29:28.254 --> 29:29.871
Have a great Thanksgiving.

29:41.754 --> 29:43.921
Speed bump ahead.

29:46.494 --> 29:49.441
Multiple speed bumps ahead.

30:02.808 --> 30:07.230
One kiss is your ticket
out of the friend zone.

30:51.613 --> 30:54.730
Your fart is a bio weapon.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.129
You got no manner at all.

30:59.327 --> 31:01.183
Jane, wait for me!

31:15.918 --> 31:17.447
Come on!
Let’s go!

31:17.472 --> 31:19.261
Lok-Han! Don’t go!

31:20.730 --> 31:21.769
Dammit!

31:21.798 --> 31:23.644
Let’s get him!

31:27.108 --> 31:28.316
What the hell!

31:29.962 --> 31:31.504
Jane! Help me!

31:31.529 --> 31:33.071
Jane! Jane!

31:44.904 --> 31:47.529
Salute!
Nothing to report!

31:49.072 --> 31:49.906
Sir.

31:50.828 --> 31:52.703
You must be attending the seminar.

31:54.256 --> 31:55.923
Please, have a seat.

31:59.404 --> 32:01.277
Get the hell out!

32:04.377 --> 32:06.044
Sher Lok-han…

32:07.216 --> 32:08.591
I’m sorry, sir…

32:08.945 --> 32:10.433
Get off of me!

32:10.738 --> 32:11.862
I’m sorry, sir.

32:11.862 --> 32:13.237
Sorry, so sorry!

32:13.237 --> 32:16.699
Allow me to introduce
FBI profiler Jason Chen.

32:19.363 --> 32:21.404
Alright, let's get started.

32:23.027 --> 32:24.654
As an FBI profiler…

32:24.654 --> 32:27.237
He’s a real FBI.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.800
… from the crime scene.

32:28.854 --> 32:32.688
And the missing piece is
identifying the suspect.

32:32.851 --> 32:36.685
So, he’s an FBI,
who’s also a serial killer.

32:37.896 --> 32:39.104
Next victim maybe?

32:39.688 --> 32:40.980
I got you now.

32:42.145 --> 32:43.563
What a unique interview.

32:43.646 --> 32:47.062
A mystery writer
and FBI profiler.

32:47.286 --> 32:48.494
Why’s that bitch here?

32:58.104 --> 32:59.980
What can I get you?

33:00.896 --> 33:01.980
Coffee…

33:03.062 --> 33:05.479
Caramel macchiato for me.

33:10.312 --> 33:13.437
FBI is too busy for dating, right?

33:13.771 --> 33:17.771
- I'm not busy at all. Really?
- Are you sure?

33:20.563 --> 33:23.980
Isn’t it a crime for an FBI
agent to be so good looking?

33:24.944 --> 33:25.986
I'm not.

33:26.867 --> 33:29.618
Tomorrow we have a
launch party for my novel.

33:30.463 --> 33:32.755
You will come join us,
won’t you?

33:32.909 --> 33:35.254
Sure, I'll go.
It's my pleasure.

33:35.813 --> 33:37.854
Okay, then…

33:39.187 --> 33:41.604
Can I come to your place
after the party?

33:41.688 --> 33:43.187
Let’s grab a drink.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.271
Is she seducing him?

33:46.396 --> 33:50.813
I’m just curious about what kind of
books an FBI agent reads.

33:52.479 --> 33:54.145
He really is the killer…

33:54.145 --> 33:58.354
Once we find this buckle
at his place,

33:58.938 --> 34:00.354
it’s game over.

34:01.336 --> 34:03.160
But how do we get in?

34:04.610 --> 34:06.109
You want to
come to my place?

34:08.187 --> 34:09.728
Okay, no problem.

34:09.853 --> 34:11.437
You can simply be
my girlfriend.

34:11.437 --> 34:14.312
All the boys are crazy to bring
the girlfriends to their place.

34:16.980 --> 34:18.521
Netflix and chill?

34:41.603 --> 34:44.021
Jason, have you ever
shot a gun?

34:44.145 --> 34:47.228
In Quantico, you must shoot,
if you draw your gun.

34:47.478 --> 34:52.646
It’s in the first section
of the FBI code of conduct.

34:53.145 --> 34:56.437
There’s a similar rule
in the writing method.

34:56.437 --> 35:00.104
If the gun shows up in Act 1,

35:00.771 --> 35:04.437
it has to be fired in Act 3.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.354
It's Anton Chekhov.

35:08.145 --> 35:09.437
It’s Jane!

35:09.688 --> 35:11.729
This is a writers’ soiree,

35:12.604 --> 35:16.604
but you haven’t
written anything in 5 years.

35:17.896 --> 35:20.938
Then Victor Hugo
must not be a writer.

35:21.522 --> 35:24.981
He wrote Les Miserables for 16 years.

35:30.479 --> 35:33.104
We haven’t introduced ourselves yet.

35:34.102 --> 35:35.726
I’m Jason Chen.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.732
I’m Jane,
Jane Han.

35:40.309 --> 35:41.642
Jane Han?

35:42.512 --> 35:46.804
Are you the author of
‘Psychology of Murder’?

35:47.740 --> 35:48.990
What?

35:50.021 --> 35:51.658
How did you know?

35:51.683 --> 35:53.062
You really are!

35:53.265 --> 35:54.763
It’s an honor to meet you.

35:54.788 --> 35:56.538
I really like your book.

35:56.789 --> 35:58.741
Jesus Christ, Jason!

35:59.055 --> 36:00.763
Do you really read
that kind of book?

36:00.788 --> 36:01.747
Of course.

36:02.145 --> 36:04.521
I see, you have some poor taste.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.204
Byeon, it’s not about taste.

36:07.635 --> 36:10.477
How you described the pedophile
in the book was quite realistic.

36:11.258 --> 36:13.788
The big guy who drives
a kindergarten bus,

36:13.977 --> 36:16.351
is inspired by
John Wayne Gacy.

36:16.447 --> 36:17.864
How did you know?

36:18.612 --> 36:20.695
You did read my book.

36:23.231 --> 36:25.022
Do you have any
new story coming up?

36:25.608 --> 36:27.192
I’m really looking forward to it.

36:28.221 --> 36:31.138
By the way, can I have
your autograph next time?

36:32.181 --> 36:33.098
Please?

36:57.575 --> 36:58.616
Are you okay?

37:00.992 --> 37:04.688
I'm not drunk at all.
I'm sober.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.776
I'm fine.

37:09.359 --> 37:11.609
I’m really not drunk, baby!

37:11.634 --> 37:13.955
We can drink another one
in your place.

37:14.581 --> 37:15.830
Baby!

37:17.240 --> 37:20.656
Netflix and chill,
let’s chill!

37:20.681 --> 37:22.306
You’re drunk,
you have to go home.

37:23.682 --> 37:24.706
Good night.

37:24.731 --> 37:25.773
No!

37:28.700 --> 37:30.617
Baby!

37:30.727 --> 37:32.769
You sure dodged a bullet.

37:32.794 --> 37:35.002
I saved your life tonight.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.945
So, you want to go together?

38:01.099 --> 38:04.641
I hope Lok-han’s watching…

38:08.083 --> 38:09.416
Do you like espresso?

38:09.988 --> 38:11.310
Yeah, sure.

38:19.835 --> 38:21.502
Never been to
a single man’s place?

38:21.527 --> 38:22.527
Yes…

38:23.231 --> 38:26.565
No, no, no!
I’ve never been.

38:26.690 --> 38:27.940
You look so nervous.

38:28.036 --> 38:29.286
Please make yourself comfortable.

38:30.401 --> 38:32.026
Unique belt buckle…

38:32.559 --> 38:35.350
Excuse me, I have to
do something about that.

39:37.979 --> 39:38.937
Hey Jane.

39:45.260 --> 39:50.010
The alcohol makes me
feel a little drowsy.

39:55.549 --> 39:58.424
Can I use your bathroom, please?

40:32.158 --> 40:35.949
Wait, so he really was
watching a movie?

40:36.979 --> 40:39.634
I usually don't drink that much.

41:03.042 --> 41:04.585
Did you touch my bag?

41:07.677 --> 41:08.802
No…

41:09.225 --> 41:13.309
What you’ve done so far,
are considered as crimes, Jane.

41:14.704 --> 41:18.412
You reported me as a murderer,
have been tailing me.

41:19.404 --> 41:21.420
And now you’re
searching around my place.

41:21.476 --> 41:23.335
Tailing?

41:33.932 --> 41:36.223
What if I am the real murderer...

41:36.345 --> 41:38.096
What would you do now?

41:49.278 --> 41:52.695
Writer Jane Han,
can I have your autograph, please?

41:54.922 --> 41:56.671
'Psychology of Murder'

42:02.302 --> 42:04.510
I’m heading back to Miami
after the seminar.

42:07.406 --> 42:09.614
I like to prepare things earlier.

42:11.271 --> 42:13.604
Why did you pretend
like you didn’t know

42:13.854 --> 42:15.479
that I was tailing you?

42:15.646 --> 42:20.646
An FBI agent chased by
a mystery writer as a serial killer.

42:22.104 --> 42:24.021
That’s interesting.

42:29.271 --> 42:34.771
I’d be hiding in an empty house
in this area, if I were you.

42:36.980 --> 42:40.896
The murderer always dumps
the body in an empty house.

42:41.479 --> 42:43.354
If he’s still out there killing,

42:43.604 --> 42:47.104
he should appear in one of
the vacant houses in this area.

42:58.354 --> 43:00.521
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

43:47.563 --> 43:48.521
Jesus!

43:48.521 --> 43:50.229
Lok-han!
You scared me!

43:50.271 --> 43:52.113
You scared me more!

43:55.504 --> 43:56.504
What’s wrong?

43:57.510 --> 43:59.343
I was being followed.

44:00.033 --> 44:01.033
Out of my way!

44:01.622 --> 44:03.406
What’s wrong with you?

44:07.257 --> 44:11.704
So, Jane, why do you think
the murderer puts the body

44:11.729 --> 44:13.145
into the suitcase?

44:14.372 --> 44:16.372
Well…

44:16.984 --> 44:20.858
Maybe it’s reflecting
the consciousness of the suspect,

44:21.604 --> 44:24.146
that he shouldn’t
have been born at all.

44:25.186 --> 44:26.228
The reason?

44:26.253 --> 44:29.229
If you look at the bodies,
the victims were all naked,

44:29.992 --> 44:33.750
and their poses remind me
of a baby in the womb…

44:33.782 --> 44:34.615
Wow!

44:35.165 --> 44:36.998
Your imagination is outstanding.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.642
No wonder you're a good writer.

44:45.350 --> 44:46.996
Snap out of it, Jane.

44:47.443 --> 44:49.318
You’ll either end up in his bed,

44:49.556 --> 44:52.848
to get stuffed inside a luggage.

44:58.107 --> 44:59.357
How about…

45:00.683 --> 45:02.351
we go on a real date next time?

45:02.660 --> 45:04.702
Not as a suspect and a writer.

45:09.495 --> 45:11.829
Yeah, I’d love to.

45:12.313 --> 45:13.063
Good night.

45:13.751 --> 45:14.459
Good night.

45:23.981 --> 45:25.136
You love what?

45:25.161 --> 45:26.168
What are you doing here?

45:26.193 --> 45:28.151
I should be asking you that.

45:35.851 --> 45:39.097
Jane, you guys mentioned
date or something.

45:39.122 --> 45:41.871
Are you really
going to date him?

45:42.377 --> 45:44.064
Come on…

45:46.062 --> 45:47.621
I brought this.

45:48.286 --> 45:49.941
It’ll be a victim’s hair.

45:49.966 --> 45:52.204
Send it to the forensics.

45:52.229 --> 45:54.354
The forensics doesn’t do
your chores.

45:54.521 --> 45:57.937
The last time you did this,
it ended up being your own!

45:58.937 --> 46:02.396
Okay, fine!
I’ll take care of it.

46:05.313 --> 46:07.645
Where are vacant houses nearby?

46:08.438 --> 46:10.771
A new body should surface today…

46:10.896 --> 46:12.562
Like hell!

46:12.687 --> 46:16.021
Our investigation is over!
I’m out!

46:33.063 --> 46:35.146
You really are!

46:41.063 --> 46:42.771
It’s a great pleasure to meet you.

46:43.273 --> 46:46.229
And your imagination is outstanding.

46:46.771 --> 46:48.937
No wonder you're a good writer.

46:54.812 --> 46:58.146
This is so confusing!

47:00.196 --> 47:03.529
Jason Chen, who are you?

47:06.526 --> 47:07.860
Jane.

47:12.274 --> 47:15.440
The murderer always dumps
the body in an empty house.

47:18.188 --> 47:20.199
If he’s still out there killing,

47:20.687 --> 47:24.962
he should appear in one of
the vacant houses in this area.

47:28.874 --> 47:30.375
Vacant houses…

47:34.146 --> 47:36.854
Where are those
in this neighborhood?

47:55.729 --> 47:57.771
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

48:01.645 --> 48:04.897
I got inexplicably good memory.

48:15.812 --> 48:16.580
Sherlock.

48:16.645 --> 48:18.021
Lok-han...

48:18.326 --> 48:19.909
You’re no help at all.

48:54.228 --> 48:56.562
Well well.

49:38.327 --> 49:40.661
No one will notice me this way.

49:46.408 --> 49:47.783
Dammit!

50:05.312 --> 50:08.062
Thought you could fool me?
Do I look stupid?

50:08.229 --> 50:09.396
What a dimwit.

50:09.479 --> 50:11.646
Hey, hey, hey.

50:11.813 --> 50:13.187
Really?

50:15.312 --> 50:17.271
It looks like the real thing.

50:17.784 --> 50:18.784
See?

50:55.854 --> 50:56.854
Stay back!

50:56.882 --> 50:58.236
Stay back!

51:09.104 --> 51:10.896
Stay back, you psycho!

51:10.980 --> 51:12.062
You stupid serial killer!

51:12.104 --> 51:13.938
What’s in the suitcase?

51:14.229 --> 51:15.501
Our wedding present.

51:17.896 --> 51:19.354
You think I’m fooling around?

51:22.771 --> 51:24.229
This is fun.

51:25.354 --> 51:26.813
So fun.

51:28.437 --> 51:30.312
Time to walk down the aisle.

51:32.813 --> 51:34.104
The trouble you caused…

51:34.771 --> 51:35.479
Hey!

51:46.185 --> 51:47.393
Calm down, sir.

51:47.733 --> 51:48.942
Put your knife down.

51:49.521 --> 51:50.437
Jason?

51:50.646 --> 51:51.938
I don’t wanna hurt you.

51:52.145 --> 51:53.062
Jason!

51:57.980 --> 52:00.271
I said put your knife down!

52:02.625 --> 52:04.291
Do you understand
what I’m saying?

52:07.771 --> 52:09.104
Seems you don’t.

52:09.437 --> 52:10.896
What the hell is he saying?

52:10.896 --> 52:13.646
He’s the Itaewon serial killer.

52:14.319 --> 52:17.070
I saw him
hide his suitcase!

52:21.062 --> 52:22.938
Die, you bastard!

52:56.806 --> 52:58.681
You really got me worked up.

53:07.549 --> 53:10.674
Jane! Jane!
Are you okay?

53:21.604 --> 53:22.980
Let me go!

53:23.005 --> 53:24.631
Chief! Come at once,
the commissioner is here!

53:24.854 --> 53:26.062
Bravo! Bravo!

53:26.354 --> 53:28.330
One and only FBI!
Good job!

53:28.355 --> 53:29.204
Jane...

53:29.229 --> 53:31.563
He’s the one!
You killed her!

53:31.604 --> 53:34.479
I saw you hiding
at the wedding hall!

53:34.838 --> 53:36.214
Get him out of here!

53:36.354 --> 53:39.229
He was hiding there!
I saw him!

53:39.354 --> 53:40.938
I really saw him there!

53:41.619 --> 53:43.494
It’s him!

53:44.576 --> 53:46.688
Things are getting complicated.

53:47.080 --> 53:48.538
How can…

53:48.854 --> 53:51.938
Do we have an interpreter?

53:52.021 --> 53:53.521
Hey, are you nuts?

53:53.825 --> 53:55.324
How could you
go in there alone?

53:56.462 --> 53:57.462
Are you hurt?

53:57.504 --> 54:00.837
Jason was worried
and followed me there.

54:03.421 --> 54:07.671
He caught the serial killer.
Hur Jong-gu’s the one.

54:07.796 --> 54:10.629
He dumped a body
at the wedding hall.

54:11.213 --> 54:12.129
Commissioner!

54:12.879 --> 54:14.712
Reporter Yum!

54:14.837 --> 54:17.338
We heard you caught
the Itaewon serial killer!

54:17.338 --> 54:19.837
Wait a minute,
you want my interview?

54:19.837 --> 54:21.879
It’s a bit of an inconvenience…

54:22.837 --> 54:24.879
A bit closer please!

54:26.671 --> 54:28.088
Son of a bitch…

54:28.545 --> 54:31.046
This is CBL’s Yum Chul-ho!	.

54:31.046 --> 54:35.754
Ms. Jane Han,
what exactly happened?

54:36.129 --> 54:37.796
Bam! After an upper cut,

54:37.796 --> 54:40.254
he immobilized the bastard!

54:40.535 --> 54:42.993
And then, “FBI!”

54:44.480 --> 54:46.313
Stop… stop!

54:46.338 --> 54:47.587
Oops, sorry.

54:47.963 --> 54:49.213
I got so into the role.

54:49.380 --> 54:50.504
Would you believe

54:51.587 --> 54:57.252
if a crime novelist was the one

54:58.395 --> 55:01.646
who caught the serial killer?

55:01.871 --> 55:05.413
I used the psychology of a killer
that I learned while writing.

55:05.553 --> 55:08.553
Dormant period between
killings shortened…

55:08.578 --> 55:11.037
Ms. Han, get to writing ASAP!

55:11.745 --> 55:14.204
So I infiltrated
a vacant wedding hall…

55:14.288 --> 55:15.621
What’s that doing here?

55:17.662 --> 55:19.246
Byeon, I’m sorry.

55:21.037 --> 55:23.580
They fall in love, right?

55:27.371 --> 55:30.954
Crime writer and FBI agent…

55:31.336 --> 55:34.919
No, beautiful crime writer.

55:35.871 --> 55:40.454
Beautiful crime writer,
and handsome FBI agent,

55:40.496 --> 55:44.871
they fall in love
on the trail of a killer.

55:48.308 --> 55:51.225
Must they really fall in love?

56:08.538 --> 56:11.204
Jane, you got an idea?

56:13.670 --> 56:18.370
It’s a great concept!
Start writing!

56:22.413 --> 56:24.121
He’s a US federal agent…

56:55.254 --> 56:57.004
Freeze! FBI!

57:06.454 --> 57:08.787
Meanwhile, serial killer Hur…

57:16.996 --> 57:18.204
Hur Jong-gu…

57:20.246 --> 57:22.288
Hur Jong-gu…

57:24.204 --> 57:25.413
Hur Jong-gu…

57:34.271 --> 57:37.146
Do you still believe
Jong-gu is a true criminal?

57:37.829 --> 57:39.413
Jong-gu is just a thief.

57:39.680 --> 57:43.513
His appearance,
occupation, intelligence…

57:43.831 --> 57:46.038
they all indicate that
he doesn’t match the profile.

57:46.063 --> 57:47.618
You know that, Jane.

57:48.364 --> 57:50.531
That’s exactly how I see it.

57:59.651 --> 58:00.943
Nothing.

58:03.287 --> 58:04.579
Oh, it’s okay.

58:06.496 --> 58:07.371
Thank you.

58:07.788 --> 58:11.245
He just swooped in
and took your girl.

58:16.435 --> 58:20.102
I have to catch the criminal
and write a novel...

58:20.646 --> 58:21.479
Don’t worry.

58:21.688 --> 58:23.688
You have an FBI agent
living upstairs.

58:29.104 --> 58:32.737
You need to start from the crimes
committed to get to know the criminal.

58:33.658 --> 58:36.658
This is where
the last victim was found.

58:40.854 --> 58:43.479
Some people say that there’s
something in common,

58:43.563 --> 58:44.980
between love and hate.

58:45.771 --> 58:48.854
In either situations,
only one person is wanted.

58:49.229 --> 58:51.646
Only that person can be a target.

59:06.646 --> 59:09.145
It was her birthday so she was
here with her friends.

59:09.604 --> 59:11.729
The victim’s tracks
are lost from here.

59:12.729 --> 59:15.271
Don’t look at it.
I look too ugly.

59:16.192 --> 59:17.609
You look good, see?

59:17.641 --> 59:19.710
No, no!

59:21.297 --> 59:23.694
How’d he have lured
the victim in?

59:25.260 --> 59:27.760
Maybe he was quite attractive.

59:28.318 --> 59:29.359
Like you.

59:34.479 --> 59:35.688
It is ironic.

59:35.813 --> 59:38.813
Normally, you’d expect to walk
in here and have a good time,

59:38.980 --> 59:41.521
but instead, became tragedy.

59:42.062 --> 59:44.938
That maybe
the theme of the killer,

59:45.187 --> 59:47.354
an insult to love and marriage.

59:47.726 --> 59:50.309
We had a similar
case in Miami too.

59:50.711 --> 59:53.210
I was in the investigation
at the time…

59:54.213 --> 59:59.130
There was a prime suspect,
but he died in a car accident.

59:59.747 --> 01:00:00.747
Oh, really?

01:00:00.896 --> 01:00:02.021
We found out that

01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:05.802
he had been abused
by his mother in his childhood.

01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:09.903
His mother was a prostitute,
brought men to his house…

01:00:10.288 --> 01:00:13.996
So every time he had to
hide himself in a big suitcase.

01:00:14.021 --> 01:00:17.521
And that’s why he chose
immoral women to kill

01:00:17.775 --> 01:00:19.317
and put them in the bag.

01:00:22.688 --> 01:00:24.646
That is so sad.

01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:27.145
What?

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.670
If he had been a happy child,
he wouldn’t have killed those women.

01:00:32.479 --> 01:00:35.062
So you think he was
not born evil?

01:00:35.187 --> 01:00:37.145
No one’s born evil.

01:00:37.354 --> 01:00:40.896
Look at children.
They’re all angels.

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:49.688
You’re an angel
in my eyes, Jane.

01:00:53.437 --> 01:00:56.062
This place is a little scary.

01:00:57.062 --> 01:01:00.271
Maybe because the
body was dump here.

01:01:01.051 --> 01:01:02.926
I thought you weren’t easily scared.

01:01:03.104 --> 01:01:05.563
I write mysteries
because I'm timid.

01:01:06.187 --> 01:01:08.312
I always think about horrible things.

01:01:08.604 --> 01:01:10.062
Then the stories come up,

01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:12.896
that I can’t fall asleep easily.

01:01:13.604 --> 01:01:14.521
That’s no good.

01:01:15.396 --> 01:01:17.354
From now, I hope
I can make you forget

01:01:17.354 --> 01:01:19.021
all those horrible things.

01:01:20.646 --> 01:01:21.771
Like this.

01:01:38.435 --> 01:01:41.893
I know it’s late but this
is for your birthday.

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:57.370
Jane Han!

01:01:57.883 --> 01:01:59.008
What are you doing there?

01:02:02.437 --> 01:02:04.938
You’re under arrest for tainting
the evidence, and unlawful entry.

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.021
Lok-han, what are you doing?

01:02:07.062 --> 01:02:09.604
I’m doing my job,
don’t get in my way.

01:02:10.479 --> 01:02:11.604
Lok-han!

01:02:12.138 --> 01:02:13.262
I mean, Officer Sher!

01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:16.221
You’re overstepping your authority.

01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:17.679
Where’s the key?

01:02:26.054 --> 01:02:29.554
Jason is a consultant
to the investigation.

01:02:29.596 --> 01:02:31.304
Of course he can
enter the crime scene!

01:02:31.387 --> 01:02:34.679
He never sent us any formal
cooperation request.

01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:36.402
He thinks we’re chumps!

01:02:36.929 --> 01:02:39.304
But you’re suspended right now!

01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:40.936
- Stay out of this!
- Stay out of this!

01:02:44.262 --> 01:02:48.054
Are cops high and almighty
in this part of town?

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:50.054
Are you belittling me?

01:02:51.096 --> 01:02:52.596
This is an insult!

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.180
It’s an honor to have an FBI agent.

01:02:55.345 --> 01:02:59.096
Honor my ass,
yankee go home!

01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:02.345
You’re out of control.

01:03:02.538 --> 01:03:04.955
Jane Han, you’re not
going anywhere.

01:03:11.096 --> 01:03:12.804
What do you think
you’re doing?!

01:03:13.587 --> 01:03:15.213
Come back here!

01:03:15.213 --> 01:03:16.837
It’s my last warning!

01:03:22.254 --> 01:03:25.671
How dare you!
Don’t move an inch!

01:03:27.477 --> 01:03:28.270
Jane!

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.421
We need to talk.

01:03:29.884 --> 01:03:31.958
- Let me go.
- Just a moment, come out!

01:03:35.421 --> 01:03:36.629
What’s with you?

01:03:36.654 --> 01:03:37.988
Hey, stop it.

01:03:38.879 --> 01:03:40.213
I don't think she wants to
talk to you right now.

01:03:40.504 --> 01:03:42.963
You stay out of this,
it isn’t your business.

01:03:44.213 --> 01:03:45.671
Get in the car.
I’ll take care of it.

01:03:45.712 --> 01:03:46.612
You bastard!

01:03:49.485 --> 01:03:50.111
Hey!

01:03:51.963 --> 01:03:53.129
Calm down, officer.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:55.213
What the hell is he saying?!
Speak Korean!

01:03:56.796 --> 01:03:57.712
Son of a bitch!

01:03:59.421 --> 01:04:01.171
Stop it! Please!

01:04:05.745 --> 01:04:06.662
Stop it!

01:04:07.519 --> 01:04:08.712
You bastard!

01:04:10.087 --> 01:04:12.419
Sher Lok-han!
Come here!

01:04:12.712 --> 01:04:16.004
If you ever touch her again,
I’ll kill you!

01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:18.916
It is truly a scary thing.

01:04:20.254 --> 01:04:22.380
This kind of emotion
we call love.

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:26.046
Thank you.

01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:28.338
Let go!

01:04:28.879 --> 01:04:31.462
Are you insane?
How could you hit him!

01:04:31.504 --> 01:04:34.921
I should be asking you that,
you said he’s a serial killer!

01:04:34.946 --> 01:04:38.904
You followed him to investigate,
but end up kissing him!

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:41.100
And what’s with that necklace?

01:04:44.629 --> 01:04:46.856
Is sleeping with him
also in the agenda?

01:04:47.081 --> 01:04:48.248
Or is it already done?

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.046
You look so pitiful right now.

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:52.671
Don’t you understand?

01:04:52.796 --> 01:04:56.629
Be honest, have you ever
seen me as a man?

01:05:02.254 --> 01:05:05.504
Just drop it,
let’s talk later.

01:05:13.837 --> 01:05:17.088
Remember I told you that
the Miami case had a suspect?

01:05:18.754 --> 01:05:21.671
The suspect was
a local policeman.

01:05:22.754 --> 01:05:23.629
Yeah?

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:28.046
As far as I know,
the Korean Investigation team

01:05:28.171 --> 01:05:29.921
is looking at Itaewon case

01:05:30.004 --> 01:05:33.254
as a copycat crime
of the Miami case.

01:05:34.504 --> 01:05:36.671
And Lok-han is on top of
the suspects list.

01:05:36.796 --> 01:05:37.504
Lok-han?

01:05:37.671 --> 01:05:40.254
They found his fingerprints
on the suitcase with the body.

01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:42.645
That was a mistake.

01:05:42.812 --> 01:05:44.188
It could be,

01:05:44.188 --> 01:05:46.604
because he knew his fingerprints
would be found.

01:05:46.729 --> 01:05:49.646
So he might have touched
the suitcase on purpose.

01:05:50.604 --> 01:05:52.896
If the emotion of love
is denied for too long,

01:05:53.438 --> 01:05:54.854
that could be a trigger too.

01:05:55.438 --> 01:05:57.021
Ted Bundy was such case.

01:05:58.271 --> 01:05:59.854
He killed 37 women.

01:06:08.354 --> 01:06:13.229
How does an FBI agent
fight so lousily?

01:06:14.896 --> 01:06:16.854
FBI my ass…

01:06:17.521 --> 01:06:19.480
He’s just an American po-po.

01:06:19.979 --> 01:06:21.896
Stop it already.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.604
This case is all but over.

01:06:27.771 --> 01:06:30.021
I can’t end it like this.

01:06:30.979 --> 01:06:33.771
I’ve never been so insulted in my life…

01:06:34.645 --> 01:06:36.604
I can’t just stand back.

01:06:38.687 --> 01:06:41.063
You’re really scaring me.

01:06:41.188 --> 01:06:44.313
Where are you going?
What will you do?

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.604
This is CBL breaking news!

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:51.565
Serial killer prime suspect
Lee Jong-gu escaped...

01:06:53.308 --> 01:06:54.384
I’m sorry.

01:06:54.409 --> 01:06:57.771
Hur Jong-gu escaped from
police custody.

01:06:58.021 --> 01:07:03.229
What’s more troubling is that
the police hid this information.

01:07:03.912 --> 01:07:06.288
Our tax is wasted
on those cops!

01:07:06.703 --> 01:07:09.411
This country’s going to shit!

01:07:10.752 --> 01:07:12.502
Where are you from, assholes!

01:07:12.902 --> 01:07:15.318
Mind your damn business!

01:07:15.343 --> 01:07:17.760
Block this too, asshole!

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.874
Wow, ‘Jane Han’ is
#1 searched name.

01:07:21.313 --> 01:07:23.313
And our company name, too!

01:07:24.427 --> 01:07:25.635
Who is it?

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.158
Sir…

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:30.996
Officer Sher?

01:07:31.605 --> 01:07:33.229
It’s about Jane.

01:07:41.155 --> 01:07:44.030
I am sorry if I offended you
when I said…

01:07:45.012 --> 01:07:46.847
Lok-han might be a serial killer.

01:07:48.476 --> 01:07:49.685
That's alright.

01:07:51.426 --> 01:07:53.301
It’s not possible anyway.

01:07:57.497 --> 01:08:01.497
I’m going back to the States
after my vacation here.

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:11.162
You said you’re working on a story
about mystery writer

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:14.729
who catches a serial killer
with an FBI agent, right?

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:25.859
Can we give this story
a happy ending?

01:08:29.157 --> 01:08:31.782
TV NEWS) With Thanksgiving long weekend
starting tonight,

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:35.265
massive migration down south
has already begun.

01:08:36.059 --> 01:08:39.475
Although it was expected to
begin tomorrow,

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.416
many have already left the city…

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.020
I look like a crook…

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:37.578
For someone with no boobs,
she sure is messy.

01:09:37.604 --> 01:09:38.979
This is so small…

01:09:40.529 --> 01:09:41.906
I could use it as sleep mask.

01:09:43.688 --> 01:09:46.938
Just wait till I get you…I’ll…

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.766
Holy cow!

01:10:14.066 --> 01:10:17.496
What are you doing here?

01:10:18.566 --> 01:10:20.149
Lend me this knife.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:23.882
I wanted to cook for once
but I got no knife.

01:10:23.907 --> 01:10:27.324
I told you taking something
without asking is stealing.

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:29.099
So I’m asking now.

01:10:31.504 --> 01:10:32.837
So many here…

01:10:34.588 --> 01:10:37.047
Leave that, please?

01:10:51.183 --> 01:10:53.219
New undies?

01:10:53.244 --> 01:10:55.161
You got a guy to show it off?

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:59.666
Or someone who’ll undress you!

01:10:59.974 --> 01:11:01.016
The FBI upstairs?

01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:03.208
I’m not in the mood to kid.

01:11:05.148 --> 01:11:06.315
Damnit...

01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:26.169
New necklace?
A present from the FBI?

01:11:27.763 --> 01:11:29.888
That’s it, out!

01:11:29.913 --> 01:11:32.842
- Go! Out!
- Don’t you pity Lok-han?

01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:35.491
Wolves make the worst shepherds.

01:11:35.516 --> 01:11:36.516
Why you little!

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.255
Sorry, Jane!

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.822
I’ll keep it a secret from Lok-han!

01:12:11.554 --> 01:12:13.678
Why won’t he ever answer?

01:12:33.798 --> 01:12:34.965
Jason.

01:12:36.314 --> 01:12:38.398
I have something to tell you.

01:12:42.533 --> 01:12:43.367
Baby.

01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:46.044
Sorry, I don't think
it's good time.

01:12:54.185 --> 01:12:55.518
Lok-han.

01:13:02.871 --> 01:13:04.163
Lok-han?

01:13:27.496 --> 01:13:28.829
Lok-han.

01:13:29.884 --> 01:13:31.218
Are you asleep?

01:14:46.158 --> 01:14:47.492
Lok-han?

01:15:10.565 --> 01:15:11.899
Yes, sergeant.

01:15:32.401 --> 01:15:35.276
Everyone’s away
for the long weekend,

01:15:35.301 --> 01:15:36.551
it’s eerie.

01:16:10.294 --> 01:16:12.711
I could be wrong about it.

01:16:14.306 --> 01:16:15.805
I probably am.

01:16:18.859 --> 01:16:21.317
Lok-han’d never do that.

01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:44.050
No, but this is wrong.

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:04.166
Emergency Dispatch,
good evening, Ms. Jane Han.

01:17:04.191 --> 01:17:05.447
Go ahead.

01:17:05.472 --> 01:17:07.056
Jane, it’s me.

01:17:10.076 --> 01:17:13.618
I got something to tell you,
please open up.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.666
Let’s talk tomorrow.

01:17:16.812 --> 01:17:18.353
I’m… really tired.

01:17:25.819 --> 01:17:30.694
Don’t come in!
This is illegal entry!

01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:32.802
Must you be like this?

01:17:34.077 --> 01:17:34.760
But…

01:17:34.785 --> 01:17:38.118
Are you disappointed in me?

01:17:38.644 --> 01:17:41.894
Yes! I really am!

01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:46.346
Why did you do it?
Why! Why!

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:51.413
This isn’t you…

01:17:52.898 --> 01:17:57.564
Go away,
I don’t want to see you.

01:18:03.753 --> 01:18:06.878
I’m getting transferred.

01:18:07.988 --> 01:18:12.988
Now that you found someone,
it’s time for me to leave.

01:18:14.176 --> 01:18:18.051
Looking back,
I was always with you.

01:18:20.046 --> 01:18:23.129
I was so happy
to be by your side.

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:28.624
I wish you’d
find happiness too.

01:18:55.444 --> 01:18:59.195
Sher Lok-han, you idiot.

01:19:13.809 --> 01:19:15.600
Stop crying!

01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:20.924
Don’t cry like a baby.

01:19:24.122 --> 01:19:25.539
Come here.

01:19:34.679 --> 01:19:36.096
I’ll find it for you.

01:19:37.496 --> 01:19:39.705
Lok-han, don’t worry.

01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:40.880
The Missing Chick Case

01:19:40.905 --> 01:19:43.281
The kidnapper is…

01:19:46.752 --> 01:19:48.044
the junk shop man!

01:19:56.461 --> 01:20:00.294
Jane, should we just go home?

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:05.072
No matter what,
stay by my side, okay?

01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:10.320
My chick!

01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:13.042
You brats!
What are you doing here?!

01:20:14.654 --> 01:20:16.237
Stop, you brats!

01:20:16.262 --> 01:20:17.720
What did you take?!

01:20:17.745 --> 01:20:19.109
Stop right there!

01:20:21.982 --> 01:20:23.607
SAT’s coming up soon.

01:20:23.632 --> 01:20:24.799
Which college will you apply to?

01:20:24.824 --> 01:20:26.241
Me? Well…

01:20:26.266 --> 01:20:26.891
You?

01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:28.417
Chung-ang University.

01:20:28.638 --> 01:20:30.513
That’s too bad,
I need you!

01:20:30.538 --> 01:20:32.496
I actually wanted to
go there too.

01:20:34.941 --> 01:20:36.816
The Hwasung Serial Killing Case

01:20:36.841 --> 01:20:40.049
Investigative Club

01:20:55.846 --> 01:20:57.554
Here, birthday present.

01:20:58.758 --> 01:21:00.841
So pretty!

01:21:01.894 --> 01:21:03.144
Thanks.

01:21:03.889 --> 01:21:05.764
I heard you got into
SW Construction.

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:09.354
How about police academy?

01:21:09.888 --> 01:21:10.637
Why?

01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:13.621
To become a crime writer,
I need plenty of real data.

01:21:14.466 --> 01:21:16.716
I could use an insider.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.088
Thank you…

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.092
Salute!

01:21:29.359 --> 01:21:33.026
Officer Sher Lock-han,
reporting for duty!

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.927
Why you're wearing this uniform?
What about SW?

01:21:38.952 --> 01:21:41.118
Government work is for life.

01:21:42.017 --> 01:21:45.184
Why did you drink so much?
Something wrong?

01:21:47.893 --> 01:21:50.684
They say my novel is soulless.

01:21:58.586 --> 01:22:00.252
First snow!

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.296
Make a wish.

01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:11.708
You can’t even fight.

01:22:11.733 --> 01:22:14.275
What’s the point of
chasing a thief?

01:22:15.332 --> 01:22:18.498
Then do cops see thieves and flee?

01:22:18.789 --> 01:22:20.372
Better safe than dead.

01:22:20.592 --> 01:22:21.758
Why?

01:22:22.984 --> 01:22:24.151
Why?

01:22:25.825 --> 01:22:26.992
Because…

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.267
Because…

01:22:58.708 --> 01:23:01.500
That’s all I did,
and now I’m wanted.

01:23:04.395 --> 01:23:08.187
It’s because of the knife,
you’re a thief, not a mugger.

01:23:08.212 --> 01:23:11.379
This is for my protection,
it’s barely a knife.

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:16.154
Don’t be startled,
this is so blunt.

01:23:16.179 --> 01:23:17.471
It’s way too safe.

01:23:18.834 --> 01:23:20.751
You promise?
You never killed anyone?

01:23:20.776 --> 01:23:22.693
Of course not!
You know me.

01:23:23.045 --> 01:23:24.963
I’m really shy.

01:23:25.141 --> 01:23:27.808
That’s why I only rob
vacant houses.

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:31.791
I was so annoyed that
I came across that body.

01:23:31.816 --> 01:23:33.858
Just thinking of
the trouble I got into…

01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:36.508
I thought I’d never see you again
thanks to Jane.

01:23:37.436 --> 01:23:39.477
That’s why
I got you something.

01:23:40.987 --> 01:23:41.946
Tada!

01:23:41.971 --> 01:23:43.388
I’ve always wanted this!

01:23:44.796 --> 01:23:45.963
So pretty!

01:23:46.182 --> 01:23:47.557
Yu-mi,

01:23:48.137 --> 01:23:49.513
let’s live in Hawaii.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:53.375
I’m too famous here.

01:23:54.276 --> 01:23:56.819
Really?
You got money?

01:23:57.774 --> 01:23:59.025
Nope.

01:24:02.655 --> 01:24:04.113
I need one big score.

01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:09.755
Baby, let’s rob this building.

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.821
What do you mean?

01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:14.513
Because of the long weekend,
it’s completely empty.

01:24:16.116 --> 01:24:17.449
- Yu-mi.
- Yeah?

01:24:17.632 --> 01:24:22.507
You’re not only sexy,
but super smart too.

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.616
Baby, that’s a real knife.

01:24:34.762 --> 01:24:36.762
It hurts!
Is it bleeding?

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:39.200
Sorry.

01:24:39.248 --> 01:24:41.831
I don’t think
I can come with you.

01:24:43.321 --> 01:24:44.154
Why?

01:24:45.037 --> 01:24:45.870
Is it Lok-han?

01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:55.736
I’m afraid that he has
some tough time ahead of him.

01:24:57.545 --> 01:25:01.503
I don’t think I can
leave him behind like that.

01:25:01.604 --> 01:25:03.355
Even though he is a killer?

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:07.901
I have Lok-han in every part
of my memories.

01:25:08.495 --> 01:25:13.454
He was always on my side,
in good times and bad.

01:25:16.905 --> 01:25:21.863
Now I feel like he’s another me.

01:25:24.416 --> 01:25:28.457
He may be a killer or he could be
something even worse…

01:25:30.198 --> 01:25:34.198
but I will protect him
no matter what.

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:39.256
I wish I had that
kind of love too.

01:25:47.163 --> 01:25:49.746
This doll sure looks real.

01:25:52.722 --> 01:25:55.305
I don’t think I’m fit
to be a profiler.

01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:59.945
You moron, but you had to use
a doll to practice killing?

01:26:00.331 --> 01:26:03.997
I wanted to help Jane,
so I borrowed it.

01:26:04.998 --> 01:26:06.581
I’m gonna head down now.

01:26:07.817 --> 01:26:10.566
You’re hopeless…

01:26:11.947 --> 01:26:14.738
Well, look at the time!

01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:18.944
Sorry, cover me for 3 hours.

01:26:19.766 --> 01:26:23.182
No way, the chief will kill us both.

01:26:23.207 --> 01:26:24.625
Who cares, let him!

01:26:24.781 --> 01:26:27.032
If I don’t go now,
my wife’ll kill me anyway.

01:26:27.768 --> 01:26:30.019
Her menopause depression
is getting worse.

01:26:30.717 --> 01:26:31.550
I’m off!

01:26:34.402 --> 01:26:35.903
Oh yeah, Lok-han!

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.275
The thing about relationship is,
you must risk everything.

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:43.780
Even if it’s for menopausal wife.

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.471
Lok-han even practiced
killing for you :)

01:27:02.496 --> 01:27:04.288
That bastard…

01:27:04.313 --> 01:27:06.104
What if I am the killer?

01:27:08.278 --> 01:27:11.403
Wait till I get my hands on you!

01:27:12.389 --> 01:27:13.847
I’m sorry?

01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:17.900
It’s nothing…

01:27:19.605 --> 01:27:24.189
FBI and Korean police…

01:27:28.674 --> 01:27:29.925
Forensics Friend

01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:30.700
What?

01:27:30.725 --> 01:27:33.928
Where did you get this sample?

01:27:33.953 --> 01:27:37.162
Why? Is it Jane DNA again?

01:27:37.187 --> 01:27:38.770
One of them is,

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:41.628
but the other is the 4th victim’s DNA.

01:27:42.584 --> 01:27:44.917
You are the killer?

01:27:47.426 --> 01:27:49.967
I have to go.

01:27:50.949 --> 01:27:52.740
Hey! Lok-han!

01:27:52.765 --> 01:27:53.849
Jason is the real killer!

01:27:53.874 --> 01:27:57.041
The hair sample DNA matches
one of the victims!

01:27:59.167 --> 01:28:00.750
Jane! Jane!

01:28:03.071 --> 01:28:04.320
If you’re not mine,

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.303
you shouldn’t belong to
anyone else!

01:28:06.984 --> 01:28:08.650
Now I see what he meant.

01:28:09.253 --> 01:28:11.294
Lok-han’s fingerprints
and blood traces

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.986
will be found together
with the dead bodies.

01:28:14.011 --> 01:28:15.386
A serial killer Lok-han,

01:28:16.402 --> 01:28:18.528
who’s been stalking a girl
for 30 years…

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:21.795
kills the girl
and kills himself.

01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:24.235
Does it make sense?

01:28:26.462 --> 01:28:29.129
No… not Lok-han…

01:28:43.181 --> 01:28:45.723
Hello? This is #502!

01:28:45.748 --> 01:28:47.665
Please call the police!

01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:50.232
Sorry but you are a little late.

01:29:10.208 --> 01:29:12.333
I never wanted to do this,

01:29:13.694 --> 01:29:15.236
but I can’t help it.

01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:27.652
Let go!

01:29:28.776 --> 01:29:30.318
You said you understood me.

01:29:30.343 --> 01:29:31.635
Let go!

01:29:33.777 --> 01:29:36.194
You said that you felt
sorry for me.

01:29:41.421 --> 01:29:42.712
Stop it!

01:29:47.683 --> 01:29:50.142
You could understand
if Lok-han had done it,

01:29:50.167 --> 01:29:51.126
but why not me?

01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:52.984
Do you even need to ask?!

01:29:53.553 --> 01:29:55.386
You killer!

01:30:46.796 --> 01:30:48.545
Why did you bring the knife?

01:30:51.735 --> 01:30:53.486
Hello?! Open up!

01:30:56.902 --> 01:30:58.652
Jane! Jane!

01:30:59.256 --> 01:31:00.298
Jane!

01:31:10.243 --> 01:31:12.451
You damn cop!

01:31:38.802 --> 01:31:40.136
Evening, Ms. Han.

01:31:44.905 --> 01:31:46.155
I heard so much about you

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.222
I’m Yu-mi’s boyfrie...

01:31:47.663 --> 01:31:48.622
Jane.

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.931
That’s my boyfriend.

01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:54.720
Yu-mi? That boyfriend you longed for?

01:32:00.777 --> 01:32:01.860
You feeling okay?

01:32:11.496 --> 01:32:12.580
You okay?

01:32:12.882 --> 01:32:15.299
Please call the cops!

01:32:16.941 --> 01:32:18.692
You are a weirdo.

01:32:18.717 --> 01:32:21.008
You want me to call 911?

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.016
Do you smell something?

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:31.838
It’s in my mouth!

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:34.874
Jason is the serial killer!
Get out of here!

01:32:34.899 --> 01:32:37.275
That’s your excuse for everything,
stop crying wolf!

01:32:43.713 --> 01:32:45.046
Yu-mi, it’s dangerous!

01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:46.405
Get back in here!

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:47.221
Yu-mi!

01:32:47.246 --> 01:32:48.787
You’re far more dangerous!

01:32:48.812 --> 01:32:51.146
Dying in his hands would be
far less painful.

01:32:52.084 --> 01:32:52.833
What the hell?

01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:57.763
Yu-mi! Get out!

01:32:58.632 --> 01:33:01.632
It might be dangerous,
run home ahead.

01:33:01.657 --> 01:33:02.824
Baby, but...

01:33:03.816 --> 01:33:04.983
Don’t worry.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.899
We’re going to Hawaii.

01:33:09.759 --> 01:33:11.217
Hurt your hand, eh?

01:33:13.485 --> 01:33:14.485
Pretty good.

01:33:33.437 --> 01:33:34.437
Baby!

01:33:37.055 --> 01:33:39.138
Yu-mi! Call 911!

01:33:59.814 --> 01:34:00.814
Jane! Can you hear me?

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:02.480
Where are you?

01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:03.876
Lok-han!

01:34:03.901 --> 01:34:05.567
Sorry I’m late.

01:34:08.197 --> 01:34:09.406
Jane, you okay?

01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:12.055
Just leave!
He’s going to frame you!

01:34:12.541 --> 01:34:15.000
I’ll be right there,
stay where you are.

01:34:15.126 --> 01:34:16.625
No! Don’t come!

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:20.069
Lok-han! Lok-han!

01:34:22.483 --> 01:34:23.316
Jane!

01:34:34.103 --> 01:34:34.894
You bastard!

01:34:46.735 --> 01:34:48.027
How can you be a hero?

01:34:48.731 --> 01:34:50.481
You can’t even beat me.

01:34:54.163 --> 01:34:56.413
Don’t touch her!

01:35:17.182 --> 01:35:19.057
Don’t…

01:35:19.707 --> 01:35:21.702
Don’t you dare touch her!

01:35:21.727 --> 01:35:23.810
Stop it, you psycho killer!

01:35:28.243 --> 01:35:31.161
Hey! Are you okay?

01:35:43.348 --> 01:35:44.306
Freeze!

01:35:54.967 --> 01:35:56.592
Stay back!

01:35:56.854 --> 01:35:57.812
Stop!

01:36:00.376 --> 01:36:01.502
Not another step!

01:36:02.770 --> 01:36:04.187
Don’t you want to know

01:36:04.212 --> 01:36:07.170
what it feels like
to kill somebody?

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:41.832
The first bullet of Korean police
is always a blank.

01:36:51.684 --> 01:36:54.893
My feelings for you
were true!

01:36:56.254 --> 01:36:57.671
No!

01:37:10.841 --> 01:37:11.966
Jane...

01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:12.949
Lok-han!

01:37:13.344 --> 01:37:16.177
Get away, hurry!

01:37:17.952 --> 01:37:18.994
Lok-han!

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:26.089
What a day!

01:37:30.504 --> 01:37:32.088
You psycho killer!

01:37:49.306 --> 01:37:50.306
Lok-han!

01:37:51.831 --> 01:37:52.831
Please wake up,

01:37:52.856 --> 01:37:53.856
Come on!

01:37:56.017 --> 01:38:01.391
Wake up!

01:38:01.416 --> 01:38:02.916
Open your eyes!

01:38:09.427 --> 01:38:12.884
Lok-han! Please!

01:38:26.673 --> 01:38:28.798
My god!

01:38:33.404 --> 01:38:37.530
Now that we kissed,
I’m out of the friend zone.

01:38:37.555 --> 01:38:41.930
I thought you were dead!

01:38:41.955 --> 01:38:44.164
Why should I die?

01:38:45.389 --> 01:38:47.263
I’ll be with you forever!

01:38:48.108 --> 01:38:50.719
Says who!
Forget it!

01:38:50.744 --> 01:38:53.744
Hey, I’m still badly injured!

01:38:54.871 --> 01:38:56.746
I know this is medicine to you.

01:39:28.306 --> 01:39:29.389
Lok-han!

01:39:30.203 --> 01:39:33.828
We heard a gunshot,
did you shoot?

01:39:34.415 --> 01:39:35.706
You damn killer!

01:39:36.067 --> 01:39:37.858
Don’t move, asshole!

01:39:38.375 --> 01:39:39.458
Lok-han!

01:39:45.596 --> 01:39:49.596
TV NEWS) Itaewon serial killer Jason Chen
was extradited to USA…

01:39:49.596 --> 01:39:52.346
Fugitive Hur Jong-gu was
reported to have fled to Hawaii

01:39:52.346 --> 01:39:54.554
with his lover Jung Yu-mi.

01:39:54.554 --> 01:39:58.554
Writer Byeon’s new novel got in a plagiarism scandal.

01:39:58.721 --> 01:40:01.012
Reporting for CBL!

01:40:07.845 --> 01:40:10.054
With so much fresh air
into my brain,

01:40:10.596 --> 01:40:12.346
I’m getting so many ideas.

01:40:12.471 --> 01:40:13.471
Nice!

01:40:14.054 --> 01:40:17.096
Don’t you think your novel’s
a bit too traditional?

01:40:17.263 --> 01:40:20.971
Then what? Make protagonist’s
friend the killer?

01:40:24.297 --> 01:40:25.423
Good point.

01:40:27.982 --> 01:40:31.732
That’s why emotion
is important, emotion!

01:40:32.861 --> 01:40:34.819
What’s the main emotional arc?

01:40:36.039 --> 01:40:38.984
Look at you,
a know-it-all.

01:40:39.009 --> 01:40:40.760
I’m sure I brought it.

01:40:42.011 --> 01:40:43.136
The knife’s gone.

01:40:44.051 --> 01:40:45.260
So useless.

01:40:46.662 --> 01:40:49.246
Putting up my tent…

01:40:50.458 --> 01:40:53.083
I’ll use my lady charms.

01:40:55.542 --> 01:40:58.625
It’s such a beautiful day!

01:41:00.412 --> 01:41:04.662
Excuse me,
may I borrow your knife?

01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.474
Sure.

01:41:09.795 --> 01:41:11.712
Are you a couple?

01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:14.370
You two look happy.

01:41:16.795 --> 01:41:19.504
It’s a bit used up,
but it’s comfy to use.

01:41:20.728 --> 01:41:21.853
Wait a minute.

01:41:21.878 --> 01:41:25.503
Aren’t you Jane Han?
‘Psychology of Murder’?

01:41:25.528 --> 01:41:26.820
I am indeed!

01:41:26.845 --> 01:41:28.137
Right? Right!

01:41:28.162 --> 01:41:31.561
Never thought I’d meet
a bestselling author here!

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:32.836
I’m honored!

01:41:33.986 --> 01:41:36.195
Could I…

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:37.303
get your autograph?

01:41:37.328 --> 01:41:40.286
‘Psychology of Murder’
Jane Han

01:41:40.311 --> 01:41:43.186
Make it out to 'Noh Duk-sul'?

01:41:46.604 --> 01:41:47.937
How do you know my name?

01:41:48.479 --> 01:41:49.813
Well, I…

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.913
How do I know your name?

01:41:52.338 --> 01:41:54.171
Most Wanted: Noh Duk-sul

01:41:55.855 --> 01:41:56.646
What? What is it?

01:41:56.671 --> 01:41:59.796
Noh Duk-sul, unpaid wages,
attempted murder!

01:42:01.086 --> 01:42:01.794
Not again!

01:42:01.819 --> 01:42:02.778
Stop right there!

01:42:13.292 --> 01:42:14.083
Run!

01:42:14.108 --> 01:42:15.232
Stop right there!

01:42:25.954 --> 01:42:29.038
How does a cop not even fight?!

01:42:29.063 --> 01:42:32.979
Why does a writer memorize
all wanted posters?!

01:42:34.343 --> 01:42:36.968
Why don’t you jump?

01:42:36.993 --> 01:42:38.618
Hear that?
Let’s jump.

01:42:38.836 --> 01:42:40.059
You don’t know how to swim!

01:42:40.084 --> 01:42:42.543
Better than getting stabbed!

01:42:54.526 --> 01:42:55.484
Help me!

01:42:55.509 --> 01:42:56.426
Lok-han!

01:42:58.172 --> 01:43:00.755
Damn, those crazies really jumped!

01:43:01.672 --> 01:43:03.879
How could you push me!
I almost died!

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:07.504
Aren’t you used to that?

01:43:07.652 --> 01:43:10.109
Hey! You’ll drown!

01:43:17.272 --> 01:43:21.022
The main emotional arc
of my life

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.362
is with Lok-han…

01:43:25.879 --> 01:43:29.462
