that attempts the 50,

05:11.704 --> 05:13.005
there ain't shit out here,

05:13.038 --> 05:15.341
but you gotta be prepared
for anything.

05:15.373 --> 05:17.676
A bunch of fun-loving kids
stole the zigzag

05:17.710 --> 05:20.012
out of the back of the
sheriff's pickup a month ago.

05:20.045 --> 05:22.715
Guess you found it for 'em.

05:22.748 --> 05:24.683
You know what some folks
consider funny?

05:24.717 --> 05:26.685
Just ruin
a man's whole damn day.

05:26.719 --> 05:28.386
God's honest truth.

05:28.419 --> 05:30.555
Now, where'd you say
you're from?

05:30.589 --> 05:31.690
Oh, you're one of those guys

05:31.724 --> 05:33.025
that don't wanna look back,
huh?

05:33.058 --> 05:35.060
You're one where the past lives
in the past, huh?

05:35.094 --> 05:37.528
Yeah, I understand.
No, I can't blame you.

05:37.562 --> 05:39.198
I mean, we all got
so much baggage.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.699
I just say, move forward.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.701
You're a rolling stone.
Yup.

05:42.735 --> 05:44.535
We had a car chase around here
a while back.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.205
Some boy got up
to 150 miles an hour,

05:46.238 --> 05:48.539
just launched it right off
Tension's Peak, man.

05:48.573 --> 05:50.709
It's like a superhero.
It went fwoom!

05:50.743 --> 05:54.947
Carnage was terrible.
It was just... wow.

06:24.442 --> 06:26.412
Oh, fuck me.

06:42.962 --> 06:44.763
- Will you just stop it?
- Open the door!

06:44.797 --> 06:46.966
I'll open the damn door.

06:46.999 --> 06:49.601
What the hell
is wrong with you?

06:49.635 --> 06:52.638
No!
God damn it.

06:55.307 --> 06:56.608
Hey Jed, what's up?

06:56.642 --> 06:58.110
This old boy had
the misfortune

06:58.143 --> 06:59.945
of finding your zigzags
out there.

06:59.979 --> 07:01.613
I figured
I'd bring 'em back to you.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.782
- He all right?
- Yeah, he'll be all right.

07:03.816 --> 07:05.317
Tire's not, but he'll be fine.

07:05.351 --> 07:07.453
He had this pretty Camaro
right here.

07:07.485 --> 07:09.455
Yes, yes, it was
that ocean blue...

07:16.527 --> 07:17.796
Jed, I'll come by
and get 'em later.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.164
All turning around,
spinning out, everything.

07:19.198 --> 07:20.966
He just slid right in there
and then pop, pop...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.302
I don't have time
for this today, okay?

07:23.335 --> 07:24.636
Yes, ma'am.

07:33.679 --> 07:35.814
- Take this off me.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

07:35.848 --> 07:37.149
There's not a chance in hell

07:37.182 --> 07:38.984
I'm letting you out
of this trailer tonight.

07:39.018 --> 07:39.985
I hate you.

07:40.019 --> 07:42.488
Oh, talk sweet to me
all you want.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.657
Get down.
You know the drill. Get down.

07:45.691 --> 07:47.826
- Get out of my way.
- Come here.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.996
What the hell are you doing?

07:51.030 --> 07:52.331
- Wait.
- I'll be back in the morning.

07:52.364 --> 07:54.833
What... how the hell
am I supposed to eat?

07:54.867 --> 07:56.835
How am I supposed
to take a piss?

07:56.869 --> 07:58.504
There are chips
is on the coffee table

07:58.536 --> 08:00.172
and a bucket on the floor.

08:00.205 --> 08:01.539
Try not to make a mess.

08:01.572 --> 08:03.042
You're a bitch.

08:03.075 --> 08:05.010
Oh, I love you too.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.223
Hey, it's gonna be
about $250 for the tow,

08:51.256 --> 08:54.059
and we'll need
all four tires replaced.

08:54.093 --> 08:55.727
And there was something wrong
with that chip, I think.

08:55.761 --> 08:59.231
But I can fix it
for about $1,000.

08:59.264 --> 09:00.265
Yep.

09:03.769 --> 09:06.738
No, cash only. Uh-uh, no.
And in advance.

09:06.772 --> 09:08.774
Yeah, I don't take
no plastic credit cards.

09:14.947 --> 09:16.248
Oh, that over there.

09:16.281 --> 09:19.084
Yeah, we ain't got
no internet in Hayesville.

09:19.118 --> 09:21.920
Yeah, so all the ATMs,
they just don't work.

09:21.954 --> 09:25.924
Yeah, we were gonna get it,
but they just didn't.

09:28.794 --> 09:31.630
You ain't got the cash, huh?

09:31.663 --> 09:33.999
Now ain't that a dilly
of a pickle?

09:36.969 --> 09:38.437
Hmm.

09:38.470 --> 09:40.139
You willing to work it off?

09:46.478 --> 09:48.147
Okay, then.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.649
I think I've got somebody
who can accommodate.

09:58.157 --> 09:59.958
Hey, kid.

09:59.992 --> 10:02.629
I got a guy for you.

10:11.036 --> 10:12.639
You want god to laugh,

10:12.671 --> 10:13.640

10:16.675 --> 10:17.976
Howdy there, partner.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.312

same as the state.

10:20.345 --> 10:22.814

10:22.848 --> 10:24.483
Welcome to Willy's Wonderland.

10:24.516 --> 10:27.654
- Yeah, he don't talk much.
- And I respect that.

10:27.686 --> 10:29.688
I enjoy a man of few words.

10:33.025 --> 10:34.993
Well, business is not
what it used to be,

10:35.027 --> 10:36.495
but I am fixing to reopen

10:36.528 --> 10:38.864
and make Willy's
better than ever.

10:41.867 --> 10:44.503
Anyway, enough horseshit.
Here's my offer.

10:44.536 --> 10:46.838

10:46.872 --> 10:49.341

14:27.092 --> 14:29.227
All right,
let's get the hell outta here.

14:29.261 --> 14:32.931
I can't stand to hear
a grown man scream.

14:36.134 --> 14:38.236
- Liv, you in there?
- Oh, shit.

14:38.270 --> 14:39.906
Yeah, I'm in here.
Can you help me out?

14:39.938 --> 14:42.073
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, calm down, dude.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.910
No need to be a superhero.

14:43.942 --> 14:45.076
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.747
Oh, damn it! Oh!

14:47.780 --> 14:49.948
Nice one, genius.
The door was unlocked.

14:49.981 --> 14:51.416
How am I supposed
to know that?

14:51.450 --> 14:52.451
Oh, shit.

14:52.484 --> 14:53.952
Let me see if we can find
something

14:53.985 --> 14:56.756
to get you out of that.

14:56.789 --> 14:58.791
She gave you a bucket?

14:58.825 --> 15:00.125
Bitch is wicked.

15:00.158 --> 15:02.260
- Liv, you okay?
- Are you okay?

15:02.294 --> 15:04.095
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just...

15:04.129 --> 15:05.598
I found a screwdriver.

15:05.631 --> 15:07.098
What the hell are we gonna do
with a screwdriver?

15:07.132 --> 15:08.433
Have y'all never worn
handcuffs before?

15:08.467 --> 15:09.434
Oh, shut up.

15:09.468 --> 15:11.771
Why not just look
for the key?

15:11.804 --> 15:13.940
What the hell am I looking
in the fridge for?

15:13.972 --> 15:16.308
God, these eggs are
definitely bad.

15:16.341 --> 15:19.144
We need, like, a saw
or a pliers or something.

15:19.177 --> 15:22.280
- Pliers?
- Can't find no key in here.

15:22.314 --> 15:24.784
- Shut up and find something.
- You shut up!

15:24.817 --> 15:26.619
You ain't had no handcuffs on.

15:28.688 --> 15:30.623
Gee, thanks for the help, guys.

15:30.656 --> 15:31.791
- Cool. We good.
- Yo.

15:31.824 --> 15:33.826
Come on. We're late.
I saw the bait already.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.126
Where?

15:35.160 --> 15:36.629
Well, he was with Jed
in his truck.

15:36.662 --> 15:38.798
Probably locked inside Willy's
by now.

15:38.831 --> 15:41.132
Well, let's roll out.
I wanna see that bitch burn.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.468
Yeah, burn, baby, burn.

15:43.502 --> 15:46.806
Wait, guys, this isn't
for your entertainment, okay?

15:46.839 --> 15:48.139
It's for doing what's right.

15:48.173 --> 15:50.141
It's gotta be
a little entertaining.

15:50.175 --> 15:51.978
Look, I wanna see
them freak bastards die

15:52.010 --> 15:53.144
for what I see 'em do.

15:53.178 --> 15:55.146
Shut up, dude.
What have you seen them do?

15:55.180 --> 15:56.314
Remember that one time
I was...

15:56.348 --> 15:58.149
Okay, shut up.
Guys.

15:58.183 --> 15:59.317
If we're doing this,

15:59.351 --> 16:00.820
we're gonna do this
as a mission,

16:00.853 --> 16:03.823
not a field trip.

16:03.856 --> 16:06.826
Are you with me or not?

16:06.859 --> 16:09.160
Yeah, we're with you, Liv.

16:09.194 --> 16:10.362
Whatever you say.

16:10.395 --> 16:11.998
Yeah.

16:12.030 --> 16:14.667
All right. Let's do this.

21:00.485 --> 21:02.288
I'm gonna feast on your face!

22:50.596 --> 22:53.399
Sheriff, if I may,

22:53.431 --> 22:56.235
why'd you request the state
to send backup for one night

22:56.268 --> 22:59.071
to curfew a place
the size of a postage stamp?

23:01.273 --> 23:03.075
Oh, don't get me wrong.

23:03.108 --> 23:06.912
I got a wife and kid on the way
and I do love the overtime pay.

23:06.946 --> 23:09.782
- Double overtime.
- Right.

23:14.954 --> 23:18.757
So what's the plan
the rest of the evening?

23:18.791 --> 23:20.759
- See that phone?
- Yeah.

23:20.793 --> 23:23.796
We're gonna sit here

Ah.

30:47.072 --> 30:48.540
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

30:48.573 --> 30:50.375
Can you pour gas
literally anywhere else?

30:50.409 --> 30:51.878
I'm sorry you pour
like crap, Aaron.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.378
You're pouring gas

30:53.412 --> 30:54.747
All right,
let me go over here

30:54.781 --> 30:56.548

31:00.919 --> 31:02.053
No, I didn't.

Yeah, all right.

- Hey!
- Well, that was rude.

31:31.283 --> 31:32.752

31:37.956 --> 31:39.257
Look, if he wanna
be cremated,

31:39.291 --> 31:40.593
- that's his business.
- Yeah.

31:40.626 --> 31:41.960

we're out.

36:12.598 --> 36:14.267
- Hmm.
- What, Aaron?

36:14.301 --> 36:16.403
We just don't need any more
Batman bullshit, all right?

36:16.435 --> 36:17.736
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, I know.

36:17.770 --> 36:19.738

No, I'm not. It's the truth.

<i>but it's much, much more
than that.</i>

39:36.503 --> 39:38.637
<i>Willy's was built in 1996,</i>

39:38.670 --> 39:41.608
<i>the brainchild
of Jerry Robert Willis.</i>

<i>If that name sounds familiar
to you, it should.</i>

39:44.477 --> 39:46.946
<i>Jerry was
one of the last century's</i>

39:46.980 --> 39:49.616
<i>most sick and sadistic
serial killers.</i>

39:49.648 --> 39:53.319

<i>to be taken alive.</i>

<i>After the police
finally entered</i>

40:45.538 --> 40:48.208
<i>the Super Happy Fun Room,</i>

40:48.241 --> 40:51.844
<i>they discovered
that Jerry and his crew</i>

40:51.878 --> 40:55.014
<i>had performed
a satanic suicide ritual.</i>

40:55.048 --> 40:57.350
<i>Instead of surrendering,</i>

40:57.383 --> 41:01.187
<i>the killers decided

41:01.221 --> 41:05.024
<i>Those familiar
with satanic rituals speculate</i>

41:05.058 --> 41:08.695
<i>that the suicide ritual
was some sort of a Katra</i>

41:08.727 --> 41:10.530
<i>transfer of energy</i>

41:10.563 --> 41:12.031
<i>where the memory</i>

<i>and consciousness
of the living</i>

41:13.933 --> 41:17.704
<i>relocate into

41:28.281 --> 41:29.916

41:32.585 --> 41:35.054
<i>Things are wrong
from the start.</i>

41:35.088 --> 41:37.557
<i>There's reports
that the creatures would</i>

41:37.590 --> 41:38.891
<i>move on their own.</i>

41:38.925 --> 41:40.393
<i>Some would say things</i>

41:40.426 --> 41:42.562
<i>they weren't programmed
to say.</i>

41:42.595 --> 41:46.399
Wanna fuck, fatty?

41:46.432 --> 41:48.767
<i>And others would kill</i>

41:48.801 --> 41:51.904
<i>and feast on customers.</i>

41:51.938 --> 41:54.107
<i>After several
ghastly incidents,</i>

41:54.140 --> 41:57.277
<i>Willy's closes
its doors again.</i>

41:57.310 --> 42:01.414
But Tex still doesn't
bulldoze it to the ground.

42:01.447 --> 42:04.083
Why, you may ask?

42:04.117 --> 42:06.252
Because Willy got to him.

42:06.286 --> 42:08.921
Convinced him to make a deal
with the devil.

42:08.955 --> 42:11.424

other backwoods inbreds

42:11.457 --> 42:14.127

42:14.160 --> 42:16.629
Speaking of
backwoods inbreds,

42:16.663 --> 42:18.264
where'd Bob and Kathy go?

42:23.803 --> 42:25.938
Whoa.

42:33.479 --> 42:36.282
This is where
it actually happened.

42:36.316 --> 42:39.452
This is where those
kid killers offed themselves.

42:39.485 --> 42:42.155
Oh.

42:42.188 --> 42:43.791
Cool.

42:43.823 --> 42:45.658
The fuck?

43:01.674 --> 43:05.478
Okay, yeah, this is...

43:05.511 --> 43:07.480
this is weird as fuck.

43:07.513 --> 43:11.017
Yo, who the hell bringing
their kids up in here?

43:11.050 --> 43:13.353
Shit, not my kids.

43:13.386 --> 43:17.323
Not our kids.

43:17.357 --> 43:20.393
Is it weird that I'm getting
really turned on right now?

43:22.228 --> 43:24.364
Oh, you a <i>freak</i> freak.

43:24.397 --> 43:27.835
It's never seemed
to bother you before.

43:27.867 --> 43:29.502
Who says it bothers me now?

43:39.379 --> 43:42.715
Hmm.

43:42.749 --> 43:44.517
Happy birthday, baby.

43:44.550 --> 43:48.388
It's not my birthday.

43:48.421 --> 43:51.391
I still wanna see you
in your birthday suit.

43:55.561 --> 43:57.530
Have you been listening
to a word I've been saying?

43:57.563 --> 43:59.198
Look at all these
naughty birthday boys

43:59.232 --> 44:01.033
- and birthday girls.
- Oh, shit.

44:01.067 --> 44:03.871

to go nightie night.

45:20.513 --> 45:22.950
Chris, go.

45:30.656 --> 45:32.191
I'm sorry.

46:12.698 --> 46:14.166
Why you stopping?

46:14.200 --> 46:16.837
Has that thing
always been here?

46:16.870 --> 46:18.005
Girl, that thing been

46:18.037 --> 46:19.338
in every single room
we've been in.

46:19.372 --> 46:21.008
It's on the wall right now.
Come on, babe.

46:33.052 --> 46:34.720
It's staring at us.

46:37.256 --> 46:38.391
Well, then let's give it
a show.

46:38.424 --> 46:40.027
What you talking about?
Come on.

46:40.059 --> 46:40.894
Get nasty with it.

48:05.645 --> 48:09.281
- Hayesville Sheriff's Office.
- <i>Sheriff?</i>

48:09.315 --> 48:11.651
<i>This is Sheriff Lund.</i>

48:11.684 --> 48:13.619
It's Chris Muley.

48:13.653 --> 48:16.622
<i>What can I
do you for, Chris?</i>

48:16.656 --> 48:19.793
Christ, I did
something stupid.

48:19.826 --> 48:22.495
We're at Willy's.

48:26.666 --> 48:28.634
Prank call.

48:35.341 --> 48:37.811
You want me to get that?

48:37.844 --> 48:39.980
People made their beds,
they gotta lie in 'em.

48:40.013 --> 48:44.316
Pretty sure the saying is,
"Protect and Serve," Sheriff.

48:44.350 --> 48:46.153
Shut your mouth, smart guy.

48:46.185 --> 48:48.187
You're not funny.

48:49.522 --> 48:51.158
<i>Liv brought us here.</i>

48:51.190 --> 48:52.658
Son of a bitch.

48:52.692 --> 48:54.393
Get your asses
out of there, son.

48:56.195 --> 48:57.496
Put your balls on, Evan.

48:57.530 --> 48:59.365
We're going to Willy's.

50:52.979 --> 50:56.116
Bobby, that thing just moved!

50:56.149 --> 50:59.119
Where the fuck did it go?

51:00.987 --> 51:02.122
No! No!

51:27.379 --> 51:29.149
I really need you to help me
find my friends.

51:29.182 --> 51:33.485
Please.

51:33.519 --> 51:38.325
Oh, my God. Kathy!

51:53.874 --> 51:55.175
Oh, my God.

52:54.267 --> 52:58.071
I'm so sorry.

53:05.111 --> 53:08.415
Hello, little boy.

53:08.447 --> 53:10.417
You don't have to be
afraid of me.

53:10.449 --> 53:17.090
I'm not the same as the others.

53:17.123 --> 53:18.925
They're so mean to me.

53:18.959 --> 53:20.427
They call me ugly

53:20.459 --> 53:23.096
and they make fun
of my colorful skin.

53:23.129 --> 53:25.597
I'm trapped in this body.

53:25.631 --> 53:28.767
I just want to be free.

53:28.802 --> 53:31.770
I guess I don't expect you
to believe me.

53:31.805 --> 53:33.605
I hoped
that you were different.

53:42.148 --> 53:43.783
I'm Chris.

53:43.817 --> 53:46.786
Trust me, Chris.
You know you can.

53:46.820 --> 53:51.324
You can feel my goodness.

53:51.358 --> 53:55.462
If what you're saying
is true,

53:55.494 --> 53:58.664
and you're not like
the others...

54:01.001 --> 54:04.137
I could help you
get to the next life?

54:04.170 --> 54:05.637
It's true.

54:05.671 --> 54:07.639
Evil has kept me here.

54:07.673 --> 54:09.309
You must have questions.

54:09.342 --> 54:12.511
I can tell you so much
about the other side.

54:12.544 --> 54:15.348
I can answer
all your questions.

54:15.382 --> 54:17.317
If you can help me.

54:19.518 --> 54:21.154
You ever use your sidearm?

54:21.187 --> 54:23.156
Oh. In training.

54:23.189 --> 54:24.991
But these are just
punk kids, right?

54:25.025 --> 54:26.826
What, vandalizing
and loitering?

54:26.860 --> 54:28.527
I doubt we'll need to drop 'em.

54:28.560 --> 54:31.498
It's not the kids.

54:31.530 --> 54:33.366
It's Willy.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.002
The dancing rat?

54:37.904 --> 54:39.372
Okay.

54:39.406 --> 54:40.672
I get it. I get it.

54:40.706 --> 54:44.177
The boys told you
to pull a fast one on me.

54:44.210 --> 54:46.346
Bravo. Nice try.

54:46.379 --> 54:49.681
It ain't no prank.

54:49.715 --> 54:54.187
This is real as it gets.
I guaran-damn-tee you that.

54:54.220 --> 54:57.023
<i>See, in town, we knew
what was happening at Willy's.</i>

54:57.057 --> 55:00.527
<i>We knew there was something
supernatural going on.</i>

55:00.559 --> 55:01.861
<i>We bellowed
to the high heavens</i>

55:01.895 --> 55:03.695
<i>that the machines were evil.</i>

55:03.729 --> 55:05.365
<i>No one believed us.</i>

55:05.398 --> 55:07.367
<i>They thought we were yokels.</i>

55:07.400 --> 55:10.370
<i>Tex eventually hired
a demolition crew</i>

55:10.403 --> 55:11.871
<i>to destroy Willy's,</i>

55:11.905 --> 55:14.740
<i>except the day before
bulldozers were set to roll,</i>

55:14.773 --> 55:17.709
<i>Eric Miller, the contractor,
was found in bed</i>

55:17.743 --> 55:20.712
<i>as chewed up
as a McDonald's hamburger.</i>

55:20.746 --> 55:22.882
His whole family too.

55:22.916 --> 55:25.085
After that,
there wasn't a man alive

55:25.118 --> 55:26.718
that would take the job.

55:26.752 --> 55:29.255
The town decided
that maybe it was better

55:29.289 --> 55:31.224
to let sleeping dogs lie.

55:31.257 --> 55:33.560
We told everybody
just to stay away from there.

55:33.592 --> 55:37.063
We figured
we'd just let it rot.

55:37.097 --> 55:40.400
<i>But rabid dogs don't sleep
when they're hungry.</i>

55:40.433 --> 55:41.901
<i>The machines got out.</i>

55:41.935 --> 55:44.270
<i>We found bodies
at the ice cream shop,</i>

55:44.304 --> 55:47.739
<i>the hardware store,
and even the school.</i>

55:47.773 --> 55:50.742
We had a real Hobson's choice
on our hands.

55:50.776 --> 55:52.245
You know what that is?

55:52.278 --> 55:53.413
No.

55:53.446 --> 55:55.582
No choice at all.

55:55.614 --> 55:58.418
We could either go to war
with the machines,

55:58.451 --> 56:00.253
come off like crazy people,

56:00.286 --> 56:01.753
probably lose
a lot of good folk

56:01.788 --> 56:04.090
along the way, or...

56:04.124 --> 56:06.259
Or what?

56:06.292 --> 56:09.262
We cut a deal.

56:09.295 --> 56:12.432
Leave our people be.

56:12.465 --> 56:13.933
Leave our children be.

56:13.967 --> 56:18.637
Leave our town be, and...

56:18.670 --> 56:21.441
and we will feed you.

56:29.516 --> 56:31.784
<i>Well, the good news is,
I can fix it.</i>

56:31.818 --> 56:33.153
<i>The bad news is,</i>

56:33.186 --> 56:35.288
it's gonna have to sit
till I get the part.

56:35.321 --> 56:39.292
Now, Hayesville's
one hotel's booked.

56:39.325 --> 56:42.162
But I do have a place
you can stay tonight.

56:42.195 --> 56:46.132
Now, it ain't the Ritz,
but it's a roof

56:46.166 --> 56:47.467
and it's free

56:47.500 --> 56:50.136
if you're willing to do
a little light cleaning.

56:50.170 --> 56:53.806
Best place for a birthday
party you've ever seen.

56:53.840 --> 56:57.343
Heck, it once was,
but we're gonna fix it.

56:57.377 --> 56:59.312
Bring her back to life.

56:59.345 --> 57:00.813
Congratulations.

57:00.847 --> 57:05.151
You are officially on staff.

57:05.185 --> 57:07.487
We lived up to our end
of the bargain

57:07.520 --> 57:09.355
and they kept theirs.

57:09.389 --> 57:12.492
<i>We tried to find people
who wouldn't be missed.</i>

57:16.728 --> 57:21.568
<i>People with
low moral character.</i>

57:21.601 --> 57:26.673
<i>And some people who were just at
the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

57:33.046 --> 57:36.849
Things didn't always go
exactly as planned.

57:36.883 --> 57:38.717
<i>I usually pride myself</i>

57:38.750 --> 57:41.554
<i>on being able to expect
the unexpected.</i>

57:45.925 --> 57:49.696
<i>But sometimes,
life throws you a zinger.</i>

57:55.235 --> 57:59.372
<i>Well, this was the zinger
of all zingers.</i>

57:59.405 --> 58:00.873
Good night, darling.

58:00.907 --> 58:04.877
Sweet dreams.

58:04.911 --> 58:08.047
I never saw it coming.

58:08.081 --> 58:10.717
So that's why we're going?

58:10.749 --> 58:13.553
Liv.

58:13.586 --> 58:17.724
Much as she pisses me off,

58:17.756 --> 58:20.093
I couldn't live
with losing that girl.

58:20.126 --> 58:22.729
I can show you
what's on the other side.

58:22.761 --> 58:25.231
If you could help me get there.

58:25.265 --> 58:28.401
- Oh, Chris.
- Liv, Liv, it's gonna be okay.

58:28.434 --> 58:30.903
Kay, we're gonna make a deal
and...

58:37.644 --> 58:39.412
Wanna play, bitch?

59:13.813 --> 59:16.282
Playtime's over now,
girlfriend.

1:00:48.941 --> 1:00:50.376
Drop the lizard.

1:01:02.588 --> 1:01:04.390
Get that stuff off of her.

1:01:04.424 --> 1:01:06.592
Willy, I'm so sorry
about this prick.

1:01:09.295 --> 1:01:11.397
Eloise, please, stop.
He's a good guy.

1:01:11.431 --> 1:01:13.901
Shut your yap
and get outside.

1:01:13.966 --> 1:01:14.934
They killed some of 'em.

1:01:14.967 --> 1:01:18.271
Oh.
Stupid idiots.

1:01:18.304 --> 1:01:21.274
It'll just incite him more.

1:01:21.307 --> 1:01:24.410
Willy, this guy does not
act for us.

1:01:24.444 --> 1:01:26.078
His actions should
in no way reflect

1:01:26.112 --> 1:01:27.246
on the town of Hayesville.

1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:29.917
You know that, right, Willy?

1:01:29.949 --> 1:01:31.117
Well, cuff him.

1:01:31.150 --> 1:01:33.085
For God's sakes, cuff him.

1:01:33.119 --> 1:01:34.420
No way.
I'm not leaving him here.

1:01:34.454 --> 1:01:36.756
I'll give you two reasons
why you are:

1:01:36.790 --> 1:01:38.926
your wife and your kid.

1:01:38.958 --> 1:01:40.259
If we don't do
what needs to be done,

1:01:40.293 --> 1:01:42.328
nobody in this county is safe.

1:01:45.998 --> 1:01:49.937
Why couldn't you just die?

1:01:49.969 --> 1:01:52.104
Where are the others?

1:01:52.138 --> 1:01:54.106
They're dead.

1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:55.641
Stupid kids.

1:01:58.644 --> 1:02:00.814
Do you see?

1:02:00.848 --> 1:02:03.282
Okay, time to go.

1:02:03.316 --> 1:02:04.952
- Go.
- No. Uh-uh.

1:02:04.984 --> 1:02:06.452
I'm not leaving without him.

1:02:06.486 --> 1:02:09.455
I'm not giving you a choice.
Go.

1:02:09.489 --> 1:02:12.158
- I'm not leaving without him.
- Get out of here.

1:02:12.191 --> 1:02:13.292
You don't understand.

1:02:13.326 --> 1:02:14.795
You've locked the wrong guy up
in here.

1:02:14.828 --> 1:02:16.496
He's not trapped
in here with them.

1:02:16.529 --> 1:02:19.298
They're trapped in here
with him.

1:02:19.332 --> 1:02:21.334
Not for much longer.

1:02:23.837 --> 1:02:25.171
I'm sorry son.

1:02:35.181 --> 1:02:37.517
Is that what you did
to my parents?

1:02:37.550 --> 1:02:39.519
You're a monster.

1:02:44.190 --> 1:02:45.324
What do we do now?

1:02:45.358 --> 1:02:46.359
Well, I'm gonna wait here

1:02:46.392 --> 1:02:47.828
until this problem
solves itself.

1:02:47.861 --> 1:02:50.162
You drop her off in a cell,
come back, and get me.

1:02:50.196 --> 1:02:52.198
Should be done by then.

1:03:07.915 --> 1:03:09.515
Hey, cowboy.

1:03:09.549 --> 1:03:12.051
Ready for a little
ménage à trois?

- You can't arrest me
- Can and will.

1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:10.409
Breaking and entering,
destruction of property,

1:04:10.443 --> 1:04:12.578
and I'm pretty sure that was
a dead body on the floor.

1:04:12.612 --> 1:04:15.082
What's worse,
the dead body you saw,

1:04:15.114 --> 1:04:16.783
or the guy
that you left to die?

1:04:16.817 --> 1:04:17.918
Are you ready to be a murderer?

1:04:17.951 --> 1:04:19.251
Because that's
exactly what you're gonna be.

1:04:19.285 --> 1:04:20.921
You're gonna be
a cold-blooded...

1:04:24.323 --> 1:04:28.127
Shut up! I ain't no murderer.

1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:30.596
Then what are you?

1:04:30.630 --> 1:04:32.431
You're complicit.

1:04:32.465 --> 1:04:34.433
You're just another cult member
recruited by the sheriff

1:04:34.467 --> 1:04:35.802
to do all of her dirty work.

1:04:35.836 --> 1:04:39.138
I ain't no cult member
and I ain't no murderer.

1:04:40.306 --> 1:04:41.774
And how 'bout you, huh?

1:04:41.808 --> 1:04:43.275
Living with the sheriff
all these years,

1:04:43.309 --> 1:04:45.478
all this going on,
what have you done?

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.682
You don't know what it's like
living with her.

1:04:51.484 --> 1:04:54.654
My entire life,
it's like I've been a ghost.

1:04:54.687 --> 1:04:58.624
And no matter what I do,
it doesn't change who she is.

1:04:58.658 --> 1:05:00.292
So I thought maybe
I could do something right

1:05:00.326 --> 1:05:02.963
and burn
this fucking place down.

1:05:02.996 --> 1:05:04.296
So I am doing something.

1:05:04.330 --> 1:05:05.999
What about you?
Hmm?

1:05:06.033 --> 1:05:08.334
You just gonna sit there
and watch all of this happen

1:05:08.367 --> 1:05:10.336
and not do anything about it?

1:05:18.011 --> 1:05:20.312
I'm gonna set things right.

1:05:20.346 --> 1:05:21.647
That's what I'm
