WEBVTT

00:00.098 --> 00:04.262
- You wouldn't ever forget me, would
you, Bobby? - Diane, I love you.

00:08.373 --> 00:14.334
I want you to find a woman, a woman who disappeared
40 years ago. She worked in a club on Hotel Street.

00:14.412 --> 00:17.176
- She was a hooker?
- She was also my wife.

00:18.683 --> 00:24.349
- He hired me to find you.
- Don't toy with me, especially about Bobby.

00:24.422 --> 00:27.687
- Rick, stop him!
- Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

01:33.492 --> 01:37.600
What's the matter? It's not cold.
Bobby, it's cold!

01:37.800 --> 01:40.234
Come on, Diane.

01:43.569 --> 01:46.970
- What's the matter?
- Bobby!

01:47.040 --> 01:50.669
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
No. It's cold!

01:50.743 --> 01:55.339
Come on, Diane.
Let's go swimming.

02:32.885 --> 02:37.652
Diane, you're gonna be at sea before
Jessie even realizes you've left the club.

02:37.724 --> 02:41.182
Jessie doesn't scare me.

02:41.260 --> 02:44.024
Well, if it's Dutch...

02:48.000 --> 02:50.366
It's you, Bobby.

02:52.572 --> 02:56.064
Diane, I love you,
and I'm gonna marry you.

02:57.143 --> 03:00.340
That's what scares me.

03:00.413 --> 03:04.315
All of this is just...
It's all too good to be true,

03:04.383 --> 03:07.784
and I just keep thinking that
something's gonna happen to spoil it.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.186
Like what?

03:12.091 --> 03:15.458
I don't know. That's because
nothing's gonna happen.

03:15.528 --> 03:21.228
In two hours, we're gonna be married,
and you'll be on the boat to San Diego.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.703
And when I join you next month, we're gonna have the
rest of our lives to raise beautiful little girls...

03:25.772 --> 03:28.400
just like you...

03:33.546 --> 03:36.982
and nasty little boys
just like me.

03:41.487 --> 03:46.789
Bobby, if something did go wrong,
you wouldn't ever forget me, would you?

03:46.859 --> 03:51.489
Will you just stop it
and listen to me?

03:52.999 --> 03:57.493
I love you, and nothing's
gonna go wrong. I won't let it.

03:58.704 --> 04:03.141
You understand, Diane?
I won't let it.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.144
I love you, Bobby.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.051
Hey.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.085
I have to get back to the club.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.529
Hey.

04:28.601 --> 04:32.298
Come on, now. You don't want me to be late
on the night I'm gonna elope, do you?

04:32.371 --> 04:35.272
Diane, why do you have to go? Why
can't we just get out... Bobby.

04:35.341 --> 04:40.438
Bobby, I have to go back to the club.
If I don't, Jessie'll be suspicious.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.650
Don't you worry, honey.

04:45.718 --> 04:49.814
No man is ever gonna
lay a hand on me again except you.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.380
I swear it.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.893
Come on. Let's go. Okay.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.463
Do you want my jacket? Mm-hmm.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.565
Okay.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.242
Come on, honey.

05:17.516 --> 05:20.713
That was the magic of Glenn Miller's
"Moonlight Serenade" emanating...

05:20.786 --> 05:24.244
from the beachfront ballroom
of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

05:24.323 --> 05:28.623
Temperature in Honolulu 74 degrees,
with only 18 days left till Christmas.

05:28.694 --> 05:31.060
It's gonna be a balmy,
beautiful Sunday.

05:31.130 --> 05:35.590
Now let's join the king of swing,
Benny Goodman, "Stompin' at the Savoy."

07:00.586 --> 07:03.817
Mr. Caine? Magnum.

07:03.889 --> 07:06.414
I appreciate your
meeting me like this.

07:06.492 --> 07:10.895
Well, to be honest with you, sir, I was rather flattered.
I've never met a justice of the Supreme Court before.

07:10.963 --> 07:14.524
You haven't met one yet.
I haven't accepted the nomination,

07:14.600 --> 07:17.000
and even if I do, it'll have
to be confirmed by Congress.

07:17.069 --> 07:22.371
Well, from what I hear, that's just
a formality, sir. Well, perhaps.

07:22.441 --> 07:25.501
After Robin Masters
recommended you, I, uh,

07:25.578 --> 07:29.173
got some friends in Washington to
pull out your military record.

07:29.248 --> 07:32.649
Makes for pretty good reading. Personally,
I find it rather boring, sir.

07:33.919 --> 07:37.184
Annapolis, class of'67.
Three tours in Vietnam.

07:37.256 --> 07:41.989
Twice wounded. Mr. Caine, did you come here for
my help, or are you trying to get me to re-up?

07:43.963 --> 07:48.832
- I need your help. - Well, pulling my 201
file isn't exactly a polite way to ask for it.

07:48.901 --> 07:52.337
I had to find out what kind of a man you
were, just how far I could trust you.

07:52.405 --> 07:57.843
The only recommendation I had was Robin's,
and let's face it, he is a novelist.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.613
And you thought he might've lied to you...
the way you lied to him?

08:05.184 --> 08:10.247
Mr. Caine, Robin said you were looking for an old war
buddy you thought might still be living in the Islands.

08:10.322 --> 08:14.486
You wouldn't have pulled my service
records for something as simple as that.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.963
Magnum, I, uh...

08:19.031 --> 08:21.261
I did lie to Robin.

08:21.333 --> 08:27.238
I want you to find a woman, a woman
who disappeared 40 years ago.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.933
- Forty years? - And you've gotta
find her in the next 24 hours.

08:34.046 --> 08:38.380
As long as it's not something impossible.

08:38.451 --> 08:42.443
I don't blame you for being angry at me, but
unless you find Diane by tomorrow night,

08:42.520 --> 08:45.957
I'll have to
decline the nomination.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.755
Come on, Mr. Caine.
What's she got on you?

08:52.465 --> 08:57.801
She, uh... She worked in a club
on Hotel Street before the war.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.839
She was a hooker?

09:03.109 --> 09:05.577
She was also my wife.

09:09.482 --> 09:13.111
It sounded like something
out of a bad Robin Masters novel.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.465
In fact, for a second, I thought the whole
thing might've been one of Robin's jokes.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.692
But Robert Caine
was a nominee to the Supreme Court,

09:20.759 --> 09:24.195
even if I did think he might
be lying through his judicial teeth.

09:24.263 --> 09:29.326
Besides, driving a Ferrari,
it couldn't hurt to know a judge.

09:32.304 --> 09:36.240
I'm sorry, sir.
You wanna fill me in?

09:38.644 --> 09:42.341
About a week after my nomination,
I received a telegram.

09:42.414 --> 09:48.011
It read, ""Congratulations, Bobby."
It was signed, ""Love, Diane."

09:49.388 --> 09:52.152
- You sure it was from her?
- Positive.

09:52.224 --> 09:55.318
The wire came from Honolulu, and she's
the only Diane I've ever known.

09:55.394 --> 09:58.488
Did she ask for money?
Diane would never do that.

09:58.564 --> 10:02.364
Things were different between us.
She was different. Special.

10:02.434 --> 10:05.164
We were married.

10:05.237 --> 10:09.139
I don't care how long ago it's been.
Diane would never blackmail me.

10:11.911 --> 10:17.144
I don't understand the problem, sir. Why don't you
call the president and accept the nomination?

10:17.216 --> 10:19.946
I don't dare take the chance.

10:20.019 --> 10:24.649
- When's the last time you saw her?
- A few hours before the Japanese...

10:24.723 --> 10:27.214
bombed Pearl Harbor.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.354
Now, that, brah, is what
I call a good-looking wahine.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.525
She sure was.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.570
What do you mean, "" was"? Is she
dead or something? Or something.

10:38.637 --> 10:42.767
I don't think you understand.
I'm John Sculley of the Newport Sculleys.

10:42.841 --> 10:45.776
Mr. Sculley, I'm sure in Newport,
you make the tide go in and out,

10:45.844 --> 10:49.041
but here at the King Kamehameha Club, you
have to be a member, which you're not,

10:49.114 --> 10:52.811
or the guest of a member, which you
aren't, in order to use the facilities.

10:52.885 --> 10:58.482
And anyway, sir, it's after 6:00. It
requires a jacket here. What about him?

10:58.557 --> 11:03.551
Hey, didn't I tell you to make all
the deliveries in the rear? Right.

11:03.629 --> 11:09.329
I think I understand. How much is it to join your
little club for an afternoon? Don't even try it.

11:09.401 --> 11:14.202
I was gonna buy you one drink, as a courtesy, at the club.
Now I want you out right now, or I'm gonna throw you out.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.333
You and who else? Me.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.941
- Get me a drink.
- Coming right up.

11:27.019 --> 11:31.353
Thanks. That's all right. I just
didn't wanna see you kill anyone.

11:31.423 --> 11:36.326
Besides, I need your help. I gotta find
her. She used to work Hotel Street.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.659
What club? Wiki-Wiki.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.325
Wiki-Wiki? I never heard of it.
Well, this was some time ago.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.960
I don't think anybody's seen
her since December. December?

11:44.036 --> 11:48.132
1941. 194... 1941?

12:15.134 --> 12:17.125
Aloha.

12:17.202 --> 12:20.000
I'm looking for Maku.
You know him?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.667
What do you want Maku for?
Rick sent me. Thomas Magnum.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.233
Kiki.

12:27.946 --> 12:30.107
Maku's my grandfather.

12:30.182 --> 12:35.586
He's also an old fool.
Boy, that's tough swimming.

12:35.654 --> 12:41.559
I don't know what he's trying to prove.
Swimming to Laie Point and back is 10 miles.

12:45.164 --> 12:49.260
He do that often?
Every time he feels old.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.167
He's in trouble. No, he's not.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.429
Are you crazy?
You nearly drowned.

13:25.504 --> 13:28.496
Hush, child.
Have you lost your senses?

13:28.574 --> 13:32.032
Is that the way to speak to your
grandfather in front of a stranger?

13:32.111 --> 13:36.241
- Not many men can time a wave
like that. Tom Magnum. - Maku.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.512
Kiki, go get us some beer.

13:49.361 --> 13:52.057
Hey, brahda, you married? Me?

13:52.131 --> 13:55.589
No. I'd make a terrible husband.
Huh. All men say that.

13:55.667 --> 14:01.264
Even I say that, and I have 10
children and 43 grandchildren.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.242
But you didn't come all the way out
here just to hear an old man bragging.

14:05.310 --> 14:08.336
Well, Rick sent me.
I'm looking for a woman.

14:08.414 --> 14:12.942
You don't look like you need any help, but the
best one I got just went in for the beer.

14:13.018 --> 14:17.250
Oh, no. See, you don't understand.
I'm not just lookin' for any woman.

14:17.322 --> 14:20.883
I mean, not that Kiki's any woman.
She's beautiful.

14:20.959 --> 14:24.554
I'm sure she's a special, sweet girl.
Hey, brahda, just kidding. Just kidding.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.656
Who's this wahine, this woman,
you're looking for?

14:27.733 --> 14:31.066
- Did you ever hear of the Wiki-Wiki Club?
- Sure. I was the bartender there...

14:31.136 --> 14:34.628
from '39 to '43.

14:34.706 --> 14:38.767
Good club. High-class wahines. Not like
the girls working the streets today.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.941
- Did you know many of the women who worked there
before the war? - Hey, brahda, I knew them all.

14:45.017 --> 14:49.249
- You know what I mean.
- How 'bout this one?

14:49.321 --> 14:52.779
Her name was Diane Westmore.
She disappeared in the attack in '41.

14:59.131 --> 15:02.066
Sorry, brahda. Don't know her.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.261
You sure? She worked there
the same time you did.

15:06.338 --> 15:10.399
Lots of girls worked the club.
They come. They go.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.138
Some stay only for couple of days.

15:13.212 --> 15:17.171
How come you looking for her anyways,
somebody been gone that long?

15:17.249 --> 15:21.345
A relative died,
left her quite a bit of money.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.786
Here you are, Papa.

15:23.856 --> 15:28.020
If we want any money around here,
I gotta catch the bus to go to work.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.324
Hey, maybe you can
give my Kiki one ride.

15:31.396 --> 15:35.355
Take the beer with you. I'll call
some of my friends from the old days.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.232
And you come back tonight,
maybe I'll have something.

15:38.303 --> 15:41.500
Fair enough. Thanks.
You get some rest, okay?

15:41.573 --> 15:44.474
Sure. Hey, stop fussing over
me like I'm an old man.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.376
If I like, I can go swim all the
way out there and back again.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.347
Well, you are an old man,

15:50.415 --> 15:52.679
but I love you anyway.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.845
Aloha. Aloha, Papa.

16:09.768 --> 16:13.260
Mueller.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.808
What'd you tell him?

16:20.879 --> 16:23.473
Okay. I'll tell her.

16:26.718 --> 16:30.119
Oh, uh, don't worry about dinner.
I may not be back till 10:00.

16:30.188 --> 16:33.214
Yes, Mrs. Pauley.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.575
Maku just called me.
Oh, how is he?

16:54.646 --> 17:00.482
Worried. Someone just visited him,
looking for Diane Westmore.

17:14.482 --> 17:17.541
Faced with a tough problem,
some people drink. Some eat.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.019
Me, I swim.

17:20.088 --> 17:22.454
I was pretty sure
Maku recognized Diane,

17:22.523 --> 17:26.550
but when he suggested
he call some friends and get back to me,

17:26.627 --> 17:29.119
I decided not to push it.

17:29.197 --> 17:31.927
Hi, guy.

17:35.904 --> 17:38.498
Where's... Apollo?

18:20.849 --> 18:23.818
Zeus. Apollo. Patrol.

18:23.885 --> 18:27.446
Enjoy your swim?

18:27.522 --> 18:31.390
Oh, whatever it is, Higgins,
the answer is no.

18:31.459 --> 18:34.451
My, we are suspicious,
aren't we?

18:35.864 --> 18:40.130
I won't give up the Ferrari. I wouldn't
dream of asking you to, old boy.

18:40.201 --> 18:44.069
I won't move out of the guesthouse.
Well, I should bloody well hope not.

18:44.139 --> 18:47.666
And I won't let someone move in either.
Never entered my mind.

19:04.526 --> 19:07.689
You want me to
take out your sister?

19:07.762 --> 19:10.458
She's married and living in Sussex
with four monstrous children.

19:10.532 --> 19:15.868
All right. I give up, Higgins.
What is it you want from me?

19:15.937 --> 19:19.668
Are you, by any chance, the T. Magnum who
played on the American bridge team...

19:19.741 --> 19:21.766
in Sao Paulo in '72?

19:21.843 --> 19:24.368
Say good-bye, Higgins,
because the answer is no.

19:24.446 --> 19:28.439
I will not make a fourth
for your Wednesday afternoon bridge club.

19:28.516 --> 19:33.044
- I don't play with amateurs.
- We are all Life Masters.

19:33.121 --> 19:38.616
- Well, then, you're better than I am. - Magnum, I
wouldn't stoop to ask if it weren't a bloody emergency.

19:38.693 --> 19:42.060
- What happened? Your fourth die?
- Yes.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.736
Higgins, uh, I'm sorry.

19:49.804 --> 19:51.863
Look. I was just joking.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.999
I quite understand.

19:56.144 --> 20:01.514
Look. I am on an investigation, but if I can
wrap it up by tomorrow afternoon, I'll play.

20:01.583 --> 20:07.078
Splendid. Now, what can I do
to assist you in your work?

20:12.227 --> 20:14.923
What do you know
about Robert Caine?

20:14.996 --> 20:17.556
Well, only what I've read.

20:17.632 --> 20:21.261
A rather obscure judge till his recent
nomination to the Supreme Court.

20:21.336 --> 20:24.237
However, those who should know
speak very highly of him.

20:24.305 --> 20:27.968
- Shall I pull some clippings?
- That would be very nice. Thank you.

20:28.043 --> 20:33.242
- But I have to leave in an hour. - I'll have
them ready for you and warm up the Ferrari.

20:33.314 --> 20:37.512
Splendid. Higgins, who died?

20:37.585 --> 20:41.214
Mr. Blackmore. Heart attack.

20:42.857 --> 20:44.984
Higgins?

20:46.795 --> 20:50.026
Who's playing
for Mrs. Blackmore?

20:50.098 --> 20:53.727
Well, no one. The funeral's today.
The game's tomorrow.

21:01.810 --> 21:04.404
What a strange little man.

21:09.484 --> 21:12.112
I really had to hand it to Higgins.
In less than an hour,

21:12.187 --> 21:17.386
he'd dug up four articles on Caine,
gassed the Ferrari and packed a lunch.

21:17.459 --> 21:21.589
After bridge tomorrow, Zeus and
Apollo might be having me for lunch.

21:21.663 --> 21:24.154
But until then...

21:31.139 --> 21:33.937
Caine's life
was a Horatio Alger story.

21:34.008 --> 21:36.476
Orphaned at birth,
he ran away to sea at 14,

21:36.544 --> 21:39.536
sailed freighters until the war,
then enlisted.

21:39.614 --> 21:42.811
He fought in Europe and was decorated
for bravery twice. After the war,

21:42.884 --> 21:46.320
law school on the G.I. Bill and a
lucrative practice in New York and so on,

21:46.387 --> 21:49.879
until he was nominated
for the Supreme Court.

22:00.401 --> 22:05.464
Robert Caine was an amazing man.

22:05.540 --> 22:09.340
I wasn't sure a brief marriage to a
prostitute who disappeared 40 years ago...

22:09.410 --> 22:12.709
was going to do him any real damage,
even if it did leak.

22:12.780 --> 22:16.773
Not with his record. But I couldn't help
feeling there was more to it than that.

22:18.019 --> 22:20.852
Right on time.
Have you found her?

22:20.922 --> 22:24.119
Let's go for a ride, Mr. Caine.

22:43.378 --> 22:46.973
Well? I haven't found her yet.

22:47.048 --> 22:50.882
Well, where are we going? On the
phone, you led me to believe...

22:50.952 --> 22:53.079
That I had a lead?

22:53.154 --> 22:57.716
You remember a bartender used to work
the Wiki-Wiki? Big Hawaiian named Maku?

22:57.792 --> 23:02.695
- No. I don't think so. Did he know Diane?
- He says no, but I think yes.

23:02.764 --> 23:04.857
Are we gonna see him? No.

23:04.933 --> 23:07.902
How 'bout a piano player
called Tickler?

23:07.969 --> 23:13.373
Well, I remember somebody at the club who
played piano, but I don't recall his name.

23:13.441 --> 23:17.309
You know, Mr. Caine, it sounds
like you didn't know anybody there,

23:17.378 --> 23:19.869
and nobody there knew you
except Diane.

23:19.948 --> 23:24.817
It was a long time ago. I told you
the club wasn't one of my hangouts.

23:24.886 --> 23:30.586
I met Diane at the beach. Sure, I knew people, but
I don't remember their names, even their faces.

23:30.658 --> 23:34.025
Look, there's only one person I am
interested in meeting, and that's Diane.

23:34.095 --> 23:37.292
Now, if you haven't found her,
where are you taking me?

23:37.365 --> 23:40.095
To jar your memory.

24:05.126 --> 24:09.961
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Last place you saw Diane was here.

24:10.031 --> 24:13.432
No, no. The last time I saw Diane
was on the dock. I told you that.

24:13.501 --> 24:15.935
You know, Magnum,
you keep testing me, and I don't like it.

24:16.004 --> 24:20.839
And you're not telling me everything
you know. Come on, Mr. Caine.

24:20.908 --> 24:26.437
It's tough enough finding a woman who disappeared
40 years ago without my own client sandbagging me.

24:26.514 --> 24:30.177
Magnum, there is nothing more
I can tell you that'll help you find Diane.

24:30.251 --> 24:33.618
Nothing.
You just have to believe me.

24:33.688 --> 24:38.682
Now, uh, take me back
to my hotel, please.

26:20.695 --> 26:24.529
Going for a ride, kiddo?

26:24.599 --> 26:30.196
You know my rules, Bobby.
It's after curfew.

26:31.706 --> 26:36.939
You weren't thinking of leaving, were you,
Diane? Not with two years left on your contract.

26:37.011 --> 26:40.105
You can't hold her, Jessie.
Think not, kiddo.

26:48.089 --> 26:52.685
Of course, if you want to buy her
contract, it's worth at least 20 grand.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.526
But I like you, Bobby.
I'll let you have her for 15.

26:56.597 --> 27:01.864
You haven't got 15?
That's too bad.

27:01.936 --> 27:04.166
Well, I suppose I'm just
gonna have to keep her.

27:04.238 --> 27:06.229
Well, of course you can visit Diane...

27:06.307 --> 27:10.505
for a more reasonable fee
anytime she isn't occupied.

27:15.683 --> 27:19.744
- Dutch is gonna have to kill me, Jessie.
- That's up to you, Bobby.

27:19.821 --> 27:24.952
Bobby, no. Get in the car.

27:28.830 --> 27:31.424
Diane, get in the car! No!

27:31.499 --> 27:34.093
There's a fight.!

27:34.168 --> 27:36.636
- All right, Jessie. I'll stay.
- Sailor!

27:43.678 --> 27:47.774
- No. Please.
- Yah! Yah!

27:57.358 --> 28:00.350
Bobby.

28:07.869 --> 28:10.463
Dear God. Please.

28:12.707 --> 28:15.972
Bobby.!

28:21.983 --> 28:24.451
Bobby?

28:29.290 --> 28:33.852
Come on, Diane.
Get in the car. Come on.

28:35.062 --> 28:37.326
You killed him!

28:41.435 --> 28:44.461
It's okay.

28:45.573 --> 28:48.440
Damn it, you've killed him!

28:48.509 --> 28:53.674
You killed him.! You killed him.
You killed him. You killed him.

28:59.435 --> 29:03.030
I don't know.
Something's not right here.

29:03.105 --> 29:07.838
Thanks, Moki. It's screwy, Rick.
Caine's lying. Maku's lying.

29:07.910 --> 29:11.209
- Hell, I'll bet when I meet this guy Tickler,
he'll be lying. - Do me... Do me a favor.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.240
Finish this beer upstairs
in my office, quick. Huh?

29:13.282 --> 29:16.945
Higgins is here. It's after 6:30. If he catches you in
here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive.

29:17.019 --> 29:19.886
No, he won't. What?

29:19.956 --> 29:24.290
I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay
that old line on me that he's on the board of directors.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.989
He's gonna tell me to throw your
butt out of here. Money's up.

29:32.568 --> 29:34.763
You're on.

29:36.038 --> 29:38.097
Hi, Hig.

29:38.174 --> 29:40.768
And how is your investigation
progressing?

29:40.843 --> 29:43.778
Oh, not too well.

29:43.846 --> 29:46.906
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- - To help?

29:46.983 --> 29:49.315
No. Positive.

29:49.385 --> 29:53.583
Well, if there is anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

29:53.656 --> 29:57.057
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.

30:01.163 --> 30:04.223
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.

30:05.401 --> 30:07.494
Thank you.

30:11.307 --> 30:15.300
You believe that?
You're catching flies, guys.

30:16.879 --> 30:19.177
Give that guy a drink.

30:54.183 --> 30:57.243
How you doin'?
Oh, fine, thank you.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.050
You Tickler? Yes, sir.

31:00.122 --> 31:04.320
Well, Rick sent me. He said you used to work the
Wiki-Wiki Club on Hotel Street during the war.

31:04.393 --> 31:07.328
Sure did.

31:07.396 --> 31:12.595
Great club.
Lot of action. Lot of fun.

31:12.668 --> 31:15.694
Lines for everything.

31:16.772 --> 31:19.502
Even to hear my music.

31:19.575 --> 31:22.339
Times sure have changed.

31:23.379 --> 31:26.712
- She work there?
- Oh. Pretty lady.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.748
Yeah. You remember her?

31:30.820 --> 31:33.846
You know, her face
does look kind of familiar.

31:33.923 --> 31:36.983
Her name's Diane Westmore.

31:37.059 --> 31:39.994
Yeah. Diane. Nice girl.

31:40.062 --> 31:45.090
I remember when she died.
Lot of people cried.

31:45.167 --> 31:47.795
She died? That's right.

31:47.870 --> 31:51.101
During the war. The big one.

31:51.173 --> 31:54.609
In a car accident with some flyboy
from Wheeler, I think.

31:54.677 --> 31:59.580
- You sure it was Diane Westmore?
- About as sure as an old man can get.

31:59.648 --> 32:02.981
Is she related to you? No.

32:04.153 --> 32:07.782
Never met her.
Anyway, thanks a lot.

32:07.857 --> 32:10.883
Thank you. Could I play
anything particular for you?

32:10.960 --> 32:15.727
Oh, no, thanks. I'd love to some other
time, though. Good. Come back again.

32:41.190 --> 32:44.250
Now, don't go doin' that,
Mrs. Pauley.

32:44.326 --> 32:47.727
You've done enough.
I want to, Tickler.

32:47.797 --> 32:52.166
Well, I'm gonna have to earn it.

33:21.730 --> 33:26.030
I guess if I hadn't been so stunned by what
Tickler told me, I'd have noticed the tail.

33:26.101 --> 33:28.399
After all,
I am a private investigator,

33:28.471 --> 33:33.033
and it wasn't the most inconspicuous
vehicle on the island.

33:33.108 --> 33:37.010
But I didn't, because I was trying to
figure how a woman killed in the '40s...

33:37.079 --> 33:39.604
could send a telegram in the '80s.

33:39.682 --> 33:44.949
Anyway, that's my excuse. That and
something else I had on my mind all day.

33:46.088 --> 33:48.056
Aloha. Aloha.

33:48.123 --> 33:51.058
Promised you a ride home.
Remember?

34:06.308 --> 34:09.607
That woman you thought my
grandfather might know... Yeah?

34:09.678 --> 34:13.205
- You didn't find her, did you?
- No. Uh-uh.

34:13.282 --> 34:15.909
But if I had,
I'd still be drivin' you home.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.714
Can I see her picture? Sure.

34:26.661 --> 34:30.723
It's hard to tell in this light,
Magnum, but she does look familiar.

34:30.799 --> 34:34.063
It's like I don't know her, but maybe
her mother or sister or something.

34:34.136 --> 34:36.900
Well, you gotta remember that picture
was taken before you were born.

34:36.972 --> 34:40.965
Diane Westmore would be in her late 50s,
early 60s by now.

34:41.043 --> 34:46.572
Try and picture her that old, you know,
with white hair, a little heavier.

34:48.684 --> 34:51.585
- Look out.!
- Hold on.!

34:55.991 --> 35:00.724
Man, you called me out here for this?
I thought you were dead. Excuse me.

35:00.796 --> 35:03.731
Well, we damn near were.
You know those tow truck types.

35:03.799 --> 35:06.859
They see a Ferrari,
they think you're loaded.

35:06.936 --> 35:09.200
Yeah, and you called me
'cause I know you're broke.

35:09.271 --> 35:11.899
- Well, I'll give you gas money.
- Gas money.

35:11.974 --> 35:14.306
Why don't you just
back this thing out of here?

35:14.376 --> 35:16.674
He can't get it into reverse.

35:16.745 --> 35:20.010
Well, see, I think the clutch
needs a little adjustment.

35:20.082 --> 35:23.643
It probably slipped when we hit the embankment.
We'll be out of here in no time, Kiki.

35:23.719 --> 35:26.916
You wanna bet?

35:26.989 --> 35:30.186
You know, it's great to have
a buddy you can trust, T.C.

35:30.259 --> 35:35.060
Mm-hmm. I mean, most guys would
try and rip you off, you know?

35:35.130 --> 35:38.156
- Tell you, you had something like a...
- Busted transmission?

35:38.233 --> 35:40.201
Yeah. Somethin' like that.

35:40.269 --> 35:42.897
Yeah, well,
that's what you got, baby.

35:42.972 --> 35:45.440
Boy, Higgins is gonna kill you.

35:45.507 --> 35:48.101
No, he won't.

35:51.347 --> 35:53.281
Magnum? Yeah.

35:53.349 --> 35:56.250
I've been doing what you said,
trying to picture her older.

35:58.187 --> 36:01.213
Yeah. I think I know her, but
her name's not Diane Westmore.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.281
What is it?

36:03.359 --> 36:05.259
Mrs. Pauley? Yes?

36:05.327 --> 36:09.457
A friend of the governor's to see you,
ma'am. Said his name is Thomas Magnum.

36:09.531 --> 36:13.831
Magnum. A friend of Michael's? Yes, ma'am.
That's what he said.

36:13.902 --> 36:17.167
All right. Show him in.
Yes, ma'am.

36:27.116 --> 36:31.314
Well, Michael, I can't
keep track of them all.

36:32.388 --> 36:35.653
Thomas Magnum, Mrs. Pauley.

36:38.861 --> 36:42.228
- Thank you, Moana.
- Hello.

36:44.733 --> 36:48.464
Would you care for a drink?
Oh, yes, thank you.

36:48.537 --> 36:51.267
Scotch on the rocks.

36:51.340 --> 36:54.935
You said
you knew my late husband.

36:55.010 --> 37:00.642
Well, no, ma'am. Not the governor.
At least not personally.

37:00.716 --> 37:04.152
I knew your first husband...
Bobby.

37:06.422 --> 37:10.051
You know Bobby? That's right.

37:15.097 --> 37:20.125
Okay, Mr. Magnum, you know who
I was... or rather, what I was.

37:20.202 --> 37:23.933
So just tell me how much you want,
and I'll decide whether to pay it,

37:24.006 --> 37:27.305
although it'd better not be more than 50
bucks, because since the governor died,

37:27.376 --> 37:30.675
I could care less
what anybody knows about my past.

37:30.746 --> 37:34.773
But above all,
don't toy with me,

37:34.850 --> 37:39.878
especially about Bobby,
or you won't even get your 50 bucks.

37:41.890 --> 37:45.018
Mrs. Pauley,
he hired me to find you.

37:48.097 --> 37:51.999
Well, you're remarkably
well-preserved for your age.

37:52.046 --> 37:56.766
Bobby was killed 40 years ago
on the Arizona.

38:11.854 --> 38:16.052
I may have disagreed with your
methods, but I do appreciate...

38:16.125 --> 38:19.424
your having tried
to accomplish the impossible.

38:19.495 --> 38:24.091
I hope that this is sufficient.

38:24.166 --> 38:27.033
Oh, thank you.
That's very generous.

38:37.079 --> 38:42.073
We passed the exit, driver.
Driver, we passed the airport exit.

38:44.086 --> 38:48.648
- Diane isn't at the airport.
- Diane?

38:48.724 --> 38:51.955
- That's who you hired me to
find, isn't it? - Where is she?

38:52.027 --> 38:55.190
- She's on her way to meet us.
- Where?

38:55.264 --> 38:58.961
At the Arizona Memorial.

39:01.069 --> 39:05.938
Of the 1, 177 sailors and marines killed
in action on the Arizona,

39:06.008 --> 39:10.172
1, 102 are still entombed
in the hull beneath us.

39:10.245 --> 39:14.181
To the navy, these men
are considered to be buried at sea.

39:14.249 --> 39:17.878
At 0755 on
the seventh of December, 1941,

39:17.953 --> 39:22.117
the first wave of Kate torpedo bombers
came skimming in over Pearl City.

39:22.191 --> 39:26.924
They fanned out across the harbor at 40 feet
and headed straight for battleship row.

40:16.278 --> 40:19.714
Bobby? Bobby?

40:25.988 --> 40:29.219
Oh. Ohh!

40:29.291 --> 40:31.657
Ohh.

40:34.930 --> 40:38.093
Oh. Ohh.

40:41.003 --> 40:43.471
I thought you were dead.

40:43.538 --> 40:47.872
All these years
that I thought you were dead.

40:47.943 --> 40:50.468
Diane, what on earth
happened to you?

40:50.545 --> 40:53.912
Well, you just disappeared.

40:53.982 --> 40:59.443
I never left Oahu. I put you on the Orion.
I watched it sail.

40:59.521 --> 41:03.548
W... I... I couldn't leave you
to face the police alone.

41:03.625 --> 41:07.288
I got off the Orion
before she weighed anchor.

41:07.362 --> 41:11.560
And then, a couple of hours later,
the Japanese attacked,

41:11.633 --> 41:14.466
and the next day,
you were listed as missing in action.

41:14.536 --> 41:20.133
Bobby, what happened? Well, I drove up into
the hills to the old sugar cane fields...

41:20.208 --> 41:22.733
to watch you sail away.

41:22.811 --> 41:27.145
The Orion was barely over the
horizon when the Japanese attacked.

41:27.215 --> 41:31.174
I realized that almost all my shipmates
on the Arizona must have been killed,

41:31.253 --> 41:34.620
and if I didn't report to someone,
they'd list me as missing in action.

41:34.690 --> 41:38.649
So three days later,
I shipped out...

41:38.727 --> 41:41.821
with some able-bodied seamen
on a cargo ship to the mainland.

41:41.897 --> 41:46.266
Then when I couldn't find you, I enlisted
in the army under the name of Caine.

41:46.335 --> 41:50.066
And you were here all the time.

41:50.138 --> 41:52.265
All the time.

42:01.183 --> 42:04.619
Sorry. Look. I hate
to break up this reunion,

42:04.686 --> 42:07.985
I really do,
but one of you is lying to me.

42:08.056 --> 42:13.653
Mr. Caine, you hired me to find Diane,
but you left out a few important facts...

42:13.729 --> 42:16.527
that in 1941,
you were Ensign Robert Wicks...

42:16.598 --> 42:19.829
and that the night you and Diane eloped,
there was a hell of a fight.

42:19.901 --> 42:23.803
And how could I tell you that? That's
what I was being blackmailed with.

42:23.872 --> 42:27.239
Diane, whatever
your reasons were...

42:27.309 --> 42:33.009
But... Uh, Bobby, I didn't know you were alive
until Magnum told me a couple of hours ago.

42:33.081 --> 42:35.743
Well, now, that's very interesting,
Mr. Caine, considering...

42:35.817 --> 42:39.514
I've never even seen this telegram
Diane supposedly sent you.

42:39.588 --> 42:42.887
I never sent a telegram.

42:48.263 --> 42:50.823
And then last night...

42:50.899 --> 42:55.632
I also received this message asking for
$50,000 to be dropped at a phone booth...

42:55.704 --> 42:58.002
at the Ala Moana Park
at 2:00 this afternoon.

42:58.073 --> 43:00.507
Why the hell didn't you show me this?
What difference would it have made?

43:00.575 --> 43:02.543
I'm not gonna pay for blackmail.

43:02.611 --> 43:06.672
That's why I was going back to the
mainland today to decline the nomination.

43:06.748 --> 43:10.878
I guess I should've known all along
that I never could accept it.

43:10.952 --> 43:14.911
Well, that's all well and good, Mr. Caine,
but somebody took a shot at me.

43:26.568 --> 43:32.165
After all these years...
still bleeding oil.

43:33.375 --> 43:37.209
That's where I belong, you know.

43:37.279 --> 43:40.976
If I hadn't killed Dutch,
I'd... I'd be down there now.

43:42.584 --> 43:45.644
Dutch didn't die.

43:47.622 --> 43:51.217
He came to me...
oh, it was years ago...

43:51.293 --> 43:53.784
to apologize.

43:53.862 --> 43:56.558
He was broke. He'd heard that I'd
helped others from the old days,

43:56.631 --> 43:59.327
and he wanted to know
if I could help him.

43:59.401 --> 44:02.996
Mrs. Pauley, you sound like
you still know where Dutch is.

44:06.208 --> 44:08.642
He's my chauffeur.

44:14.049 --> 44:17.610
It was more ironic
than a Robin Masters novel.

44:17.686 --> 44:20.917
She thought he was dead.
He thought she was dead.

44:20.989 --> 44:25.050
And only the chauffeur knew the truth.
He should've been the butler.

44:25.127 --> 44:29.223
I just hoped that Rick didn't get lonely
and start talking.

44:33.201 --> 44:36.102
Hey. You been hackin' long?

44:36.171 --> 44:39.106
You got the sports page. Could I take a look
at it? I wanna see if my horse won yesterday.

44:39.174 --> 44:42.234
It's my first day.
Probably be your last.

44:42.310 --> 44:46.303
Boy, I hope so. I'm chauffeuring the
judge around for this pal of mine.

44:46.381 --> 44:49.661
Hey, let me ask you somethin'. Don't you get
bored just sittin' around here all day?

44:56.591 --> 44:59.355
Now what's he tryin' to do?

45:06.034 --> 45:08.901
Rick, stop him!

45:08.970 --> 45:10.995
What?

45:11.072 --> 45:13.063
Stop him!

45:15.110 --> 45:17.078
Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

45:17.145 --> 45:21.047
What the heck is goin' on?
That guy almost ran over my foot. What?

45:21.116 --> 45:25.280
I thought
I'm supposed to be the driver.

45:51.179 --> 45:53.670
Hey! This is security unit one.

45:53.748 --> 45:56.444
Here come the marines!

45:56.518 --> 46:01.217
Two unauthorized vehicles have just
penetrated base security. We are in pursuit.

46:01.289 --> 46:03.621
Take it easy. This isn't a Ferrari.
Trust me.

46:07.329 --> 46:10.264
Oh, cute. This is really cute.

46:29.217 --> 46:33.244
Intruding vehicles are black limousines
currently headed for Pier 67.

46:33.321 --> 46:35.380
Request assistance. Over.

46:35.457 --> 46:41.089
Security unit five, unit one
reporting pursuit of vehicles on Pier 67.

46:44.299 --> 46:47.632
Hold on!

46:49.971 --> 46:52.667
It's blocked, and we're blocked.

47:05.387 --> 47:09.949
Oh, hi, guys.

47:12.327 --> 47:16.320
Uh-oh. They can't
make us re-up, can they?

47:21.703 --> 47:24.831
I'm, uh, sure he'll be here
at any moment.

47:26.941 --> 47:30.536
Ah. Must be him now.

47:39.054 --> 47:43.047
Glad you could join us, old boy.
Thank you.

47:43.124 --> 47:48.061
- I believe you know Mrs. Blackmore. - Ah, yes.
I was very sorry to hear about your husband.

47:50.899 --> 47:55.302
And this is Mrs. Pauley,
the widow of Governor Pauley.

47:55.370 --> 47:58.533
Nice to see you again.
Thank you.

48:00.208 --> 48:02.369
You know each other?

48:02.444 --> 48:05.140
Well, we have a mutual friend.
Have you heard from the judge?

48:05.213 --> 48:08.705
Yes. He's meeting
with the president about now...

48:08.783 --> 48:11.149
to politely decline.

48:11.219 --> 48:16.589
- Really? - And then he's coming
back here for a long vacation.

48:17.926 --> 48:21.089
Higgins, you're catching flies.
Oh, yes.

48:21.162 --> 48:24.689
Well, shall we begin?

48:24.766 --> 48:29.169
Uh, Higgins, I think there's something
we should get straight before we start.

48:29.237 --> 48:32.434
Of course. What conventions we play.
We play Kennedy, single Swiss,

48:32.507 --> 48:36.068
jacoby transfer, Michael's cue-bid,
August response to weak twos and DOPI...

48:36.144 --> 48:38.578
in addition to Gerber,
Blackwood and Stayman.

48:38.646 --> 48:41.638
I assume those are the same conventions
you used on the American team.

48:41.716 --> 48:44.378
I was never on the American team.

48:52.327 --> 48:57.390
You're not the T. Magnum
who played in Sao Paulo in '72?

48:59.067 --> 49:02.059
Higgins, I never said I was.

49:03.204 --> 49:06.537
I'm sure I can learn bridge.
I'm great at poker. What's wild?
