00:06.110 --> 00:07.610
[Jace] <i>Previously
on</i> Shadowhunters...

00:08.450 --> 00:09.450
[Alec] <i>What did I do?</i>

00:09.530 --> 00:12.240
- Clary, I am so sorry.
- Please don't.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.596
<i>Can you raise my
mother from the dead?</i>

00:13.620 --> 00:16.790
I'll bring your mother back, and,
as payment, you can owe me a favor.

00:16.870 --> 00:19.790
- The deal's off.
- No. You took a blood oath.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.710
[Cleophas] <i>If ever demons
overtook the world...</i>

00:22.580 --> 00:23.460
As a last resort,

00:23.540 --> 00:27.130
<i>the Soul-Sword would destroy
demon-blooded creatures in its path.</i>

00:27.210 --> 00:29.550
- Demon-blooded creatures.
- Downworlders.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.380
We have to free the angel.
If Valentine has the angel...

00:35.470 --> 00:37.300
[Clary] <i>He can activate
the Soul-Sword.</i>

00:41.940 --> 00:43.780
[Magnus] <i>I've seen the
havoc</i> yin fen <i>can wreak.</i>

00:43.820 --> 00:45.296
[Isabelle] <i>Do you know where
to look for the source?</i>

00:45.320 --> 00:48.046
Probably one of the Night Children.
<i>Yin fen</i> is made from vampire venom.

00:48.070 --> 00:49.870
There's just something I need.

00:55.330 --> 00:56.930
[Eloise] What do you
need, Shadowhunter?

00:58.620 --> 01:00.870
Look,
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.290
I just need a little... venom.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.750
Someone's been a naughty girl.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.850
All out of <i>yin fen?</i>

01:11.130 --> 01:13.760
That's okay.
You can have a little venom...

01:14.640 --> 01:17.270
I'm just gonna need
a lot of blood.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.560
[vampires hissing]

01:22.230 --> 01:23.400
[chuckles]

01:24.060 --> 01:26.350
You're quick,
but not quick enough.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.520
Forget the venom.

01:29.610 --> 01:31.570
Too late, pretty thing.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.190
[grunts]

01:34.160 --> 01:35.410
Release the Shadowhunter.

01:36.620 --> 01:37.790
On my orders.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.510
[Isabelle breathing shakily]

01:50.880 --> 01:52.630
I thought you hated me.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.850
Call it an intense dislike.

01:55.970 --> 01:57.220
So why are you helping me?

02:00.470 --> 02:01.680
I don't know.

02:07.690 --> 02:08.860
[Isabelle groaning]

02:14.860 --> 02:16.860
The pain... it's everywhere.

02:16.950 --> 02:18.000
[shuddering]

02:18.080 --> 02:20.080
What did you think <i>yin
fen</i> would do to you?

02:20.160 --> 02:21.280
I need something...

02:22.040 --> 02:23.540
something to stop it.

02:23.620 --> 02:25.950
What you need to
do is sweat it out.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.210
Okay, over time,
you'll be better off.

02:29.090 --> 02:30.396
- You need to be strong.
- I can't.

02:30.420 --> 02:31.500
You have to.

02:32.710 --> 02:36.050
I swear, I'll never ask again.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.360
Just this once.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.940
Forgive me.

02:57.870 --> 02:58.870
[gasps]

03:28.270 --> 03:29.336
[Luke] How could you
not tell me that?

03:29.360 --> 03:32.206
The Downworld would be in total chaos
if they knew what the Sword could do.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.670
There would be
uprisings everywhere.

03:33.730 --> 03:36.820
So you're saving the Downworlders
from themselves? We never asked.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.240
We didn't even know that
Valentine could activate the Sword

03:39.320 --> 03:41.570
until we realized
he had an angel.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.980
Luke,
I didn't want you to worry.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.096
Well, it's too late for that.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.030
- Look, you don't understand, all right...
- No. I do understand.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.580
He has my sister.

03:53.210 --> 03:54.710
{\an8}What else aren't
you two telling me?

03:58.510 --> 04:01.390
{\an8}The angel, he...
he showed us something.

04:02.430 --> 04:04.906
{\an8}Just now, on the rooftop,
he showed us both a vision of a demon

04:04.930 --> 04:06.300
{\an8}that can destroy the Sword.

04:06.390 --> 04:08.720
{\an8}How do you know that's
what he was telling you?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.820
{\an8}There's no other explanation.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.110
{\an8}When the demon touched the Sword,
he and the Sword both disintegrated.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.980
Luke, it was a demon
I'd never seen before.

04:20.110 --> 04:21.110
Then go find it.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.700
I'll head out and see if that bastard
left any clues for us to track him down.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.550
[processing]

04:34.250 --> 04:36.790
There.
They said that was the angel.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.606
[Isabelle] It could have
been a shooting star.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.750
Are you saying you don't
believe Jace and Clary?

04:40.840 --> 04:42.000
I thought you'd be impressed.

04:42.050 --> 04:43.550
I'm not saying I
don't believe them.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.440
It's just that no one's seen
an angel in hundreds of years.

04:49.310 --> 04:50.430
[sighs] So...

04:50.520 --> 04:53.280
{\an8}did you take my
advice about Magnus?

04:53.940 --> 04:54.980
You did, didn't you?

04:55.520 --> 04:56.850
Okay, start talking.

04:56.940 --> 04:58.980
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Hey, you guys.

04:59.070 --> 05:03.530
{\an8}-Hey, buddy. How are you doing?
- Max! I missed you so much!

05:03.620 --> 05:05.410
{\an8}You look so handsome.

05:05.490 --> 05:06.820
What are you doing here?

05:07.660 --> 05:09.620
Alec. Isabelle.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.130
It's good to see you both.

05:12.210 --> 05:13.760
{\an8}-Really?
- Izzy...

05:13.830 --> 05:16.750
{\an8}'Cause the last time you were here,
you turned your back on all of us.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.350
{\an8}-Especially Jace.
- I was following orders.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.090
{\an8}I had no choice.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.590
{\an8}Max has some big news.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.770
Tell them, sweetheart.

05:24.850 --> 05:28.060
I passed my last trial.
I'm ready for my Rune Ceremony.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.140
Congratulations.

05:29.230 --> 05:31.190
So you finally perfected
your roundhouse kick?

05:31.270 --> 05:33.780
Yeah, and I knocked out
two different instructors.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.140
{\an8}Sadly, your father
won't be able to attend.

05:37.230 --> 05:39.480
{\an8}So, Alec,
as the eldest male in the family,

05:39.570 --> 05:42.740
{\an8}you will be in charge of
Max's ceremonial party.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.190
{\an8}What do you mean
he won't be here?

05:45.030 --> 05:48.030
{\an8}He's tied up with the
Valentine task force in Idris.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.580
I can't believe Dad
would miss this.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.450
[Maryse] He doesn't
have a choice.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.880
We're all on high alert, especially after
what that demon did to both of you...

05:56.540 --> 05:57.790
{\an8}and Jocelyn.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.170
I was surprised not to see
you at the Rite of Mourning.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.300
Dad called to see how we were.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.480
{\an8}Isabelle...

06:13.810 --> 06:16.270
{\an8}Bet you wish you
were back in Idris.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.900
{\an8}I thought I was coming here
to get away from the fighting.

06:19.530 --> 06:22.030
{\an8}Fighting? Mom and Dad?

06:22.110 --> 06:23.610
{\an8}All the time.

06:24.780 --> 06:26.610
What's going on?

06:26.700 --> 06:29.420
Mom doesn't like you
having a warlock boyfriend.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.250
And you?

06:33.870 --> 06:35.950
Whatever, I don't care.

06:41.090 --> 06:42.970
{\an8}My mother's back.

06:43.050 --> 06:45.180
{\an8}Which means I'll
make myself scarce.

06:45.260 --> 06:48.270
{\an8}-No, I have something else in mind.
- Hmm.

06:48.350 --> 06:51.520
{\an8}How would you feel
about throwing a party?

06:53.140 --> 06:54.140
{\an8}Have you met me?

06:55.890 --> 06:58.560
{\an8}It is for Max's Rune Ceremony.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.820
{\an8}-I think I'll pass.
- Magnus...

07:01.730 --> 07:05.690
{\an8}I'm sure I'll love Max. But Maryse?
That woman hates me.

07:05.780 --> 07:07.300
{\an8}That's sort of the
point of the party.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.110
{\an8}So that she can see that
this, us, it's not going away.

07:14.580 --> 07:15.580
{\an8}You sure about this?

07:16.790 --> 07:17.870
Why wouldn't I be?

07:20.790 --> 07:22.080
Then I better get to work.

07:52.780 --> 07:54.370
{\an8}Mr. Morgenstern.

07:55.330 --> 07:56.710
What can I help you with?

07:57.620 --> 08:00.750
A potion? A spell?
I'm very versatile.

08:01.590 --> 08:03.430
In a way that makes
my skin crawl.

08:05.170 --> 08:07.840
I thought we would
understand each other.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.880
Both scientists
in our own right.

08:09.970 --> 08:11.730
I applaud your spirit,
but it won't help you.

08:13.890 --> 08:17.020
I hear you've met my
daughter, Clarissa?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.810
- I had no idea...
- [sighs] Children...

08:23.900 --> 08:26.450
have a way of making
us terribly vulnerable,

08:27.740 --> 08:29.200
don't they?

08:37.200 --> 08:38.740
Don't.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.700
Please, don't hurt her.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.590
I will do anything you ask.

08:43.669 --> 08:46.470
Yes... you will.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.300
[Simon] This isn't crazy.

08:52.390 --> 08:53.600
[chuckles] You drank blood.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.810
[stuttering] You...

08:54.890 --> 08:56.850
You've bit a rat.
It's gonna be fine.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.220
You fought a cobra.
You went to India.

08:59.310 --> 09:00.750
You can...
You can totally tell her.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.400
It's Clary. It's not like it's a...
another cobra.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.690
That would be something.
Seriously...

09:06.780 --> 09:09.330
- [Clary] Simon, are you okay?
- Yeah.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.860
- [chuckles]
- I'm very okay.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.700
Hopefully.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.216
Do you wanna sit?
I mean, standing works, too.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.700
Okay. What's going on?

09:16.450 --> 09:19.490
I get this weird text to meet you here
at, like, 11:00 at night?

09:22.620 --> 09:24.660
Did something happen
with you and Maia?

09:26.590 --> 09:28.640
Yes. Something did happen.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.390
Um...

09:30.470 --> 09:32.060
Look, Clary...

09:33.640 --> 09:36.560
the thing is, um...

09:38.470 --> 09:40.720
Simon,
I don't have a telepathy rune.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.150
[both laugh]

09:42.230 --> 09:43.610
Right. Of course not.

09:43.690 --> 09:45.030
Okay.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.700
We've been friends...

09:49.740 --> 09:51.280
Best friends for a long time.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.650
A really long time.

09:53.740 --> 09:57.040
And the last thing I'd ever
want to do is screw that up.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.290
Because it's...
it's really important to me.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.710
It's really important to
me, too.

10:02.790 --> 10:06.300
But... the thing is,
when two people are friends...

10:07.790 --> 10:09.710
people like you and me...

10:11.220 --> 10:14.600
sometimes feelings
evolve, you know?

10:14.680 --> 10:17.520
And the relationship,
friendship, whatever it is,

10:17.600 --> 10:19.400
needs to change along with it...

10:19.470 --> 10:22.180
Look, Simon, I...
Is this because of Maia?

10:24.190 --> 10:28.280
I don't want you to think that we can't
still be best friends because you...

10:29.900 --> 10:31.230
because you're seeing someone.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.700
No, see, that's... that's it!

10:33.610 --> 10:35.900
I don't...
I don't want to see anyone.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.710
Anyone... anyone else, I mean.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.840
I'm in love with you, Clary.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.220
But I realized that you
might not feel the same way.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.760
[stuttering] And it might get weird...
It might be...

11:10.570 --> 11:11.570
[exhales]

11:12.780 --> 11:13.780
We did that.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.240
- We did.
- [laughing] Yeah, we did.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.690
[laughs] We did.

11:19.660 --> 11:22.120
Was it... Was it, you know...

11:22.200 --> 11:23.490
- [stammering]
- Weird?

11:23.580 --> 11:24.790
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

11:27.670 --> 11:29.840
In the best way possible.

11:39.890 --> 11:42.480
{\an8}At the residence of Magnus Bane?

11:44.100 --> 11:45.940
It's very kind of
your friend to offer,

11:46.020 --> 11:48.860
but the Rune Ceremony is
a solemn rite of passage.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.070
For Shadowhunters.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.490
Not some Downworlder rave.

11:52.570 --> 11:55.030
Where does it say
anything about a rave?

11:55.110 --> 11:57.360
- And why is it only for Shadowhunters?
- It's tradition.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.120
Traditions change,
especially those based on ignorance.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.120
[chuckles]

12:01.200 --> 12:02.910
Anyone who cares about
Max should be there.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.280
And that includes me and Magnus.

12:05.370 --> 12:06.370
Together.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.380
[sighs]

12:07.460 --> 12:09.620
- If Dad were here he'd understand...
- Well, he's not.

12:14.090 --> 12:17.100
Alec...
I don't want to fight with you.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.520
This dinner, it should be about family.
Our family.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.310
What family?

12:23.890 --> 12:27.310
- You wanted Jace dead.
- I was following orders.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.190
You keep saying that.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.490
After a while,
it loses its meaning.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.440
[sighs]

12:38.320 --> 12:39.330
You're right.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.070
Of course we'll be there.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.250
Thank you for going to
all this trouble for us.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.050
Thank Magnus.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.920
[cats meowing]

13:06.430 --> 13:08.470
- [purring]
- Magnus!

13:11.980 --> 13:12.980
Aw!

13:13.690 --> 13:15.860
[speaking French]

13:15.940 --> 13:17.730
[clicks tongue] You're
new, aren't you?

13:18.820 --> 13:20.200
[tutting]

13:24.320 --> 13:26.610
I spoil them. I can't help it.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.100
It's the only way
to win them over.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.726
Well, I guess when you
put your mind to it,

13:29.750 --> 13:32.300
you can win over just about
anyone, huh?

13:33.830 --> 13:34.870
You're talking about Alec.

13:35.590 --> 13:37.130
Look, I've been there.

13:37.210 --> 13:40.840
I know it's a whirlwind fling that
burns so hot all it can do is flame out.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.840
Is this what you think it is?
A fling.

13:44.930 --> 13:46.350
I don't know what it is,

13:46.430 --> 13:48.650
but I know my brother.
He's sensitive.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.600
And now that you guys have taken
things to the next level...

13:51.690 --> 13:55.190
- He told you.
- No, he didn't have to. We're <i>parabatai.</i>

13:59.150 --> 14:02.150
No. No, no, no.
No, it's not like that.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.200
It's... I can, uh...

14:04.280 --> 14:06.110
I can just...
I can sense that he's happier.

14:06.950 --> 14:09.360
Look, I'll make this
simple, okay?

14:09.450 --> 14:11.280
I'm never gonna let
anyone hurt him.

14:13.670 --> 14:14.800
Then we have that in common.

14:16.790 --> 14:20.880
You think I'd invite Maryse
Lightwood to my home for just anyone?

14:26.140 --> 14:27.140
[exhales]

14:27.220 --> 14:28.720
I hope this party
has an open bar.

14:32.850 --> 14:34.470
[Clary and Simon laughing]

14:36.650 --> 14:37.990
[laughing]

14:40.030 --> 14:42.910
- Is there something on my face, or...
- No, no, um...

14:43.990 --> 14:45.160
You're great.

14:46.530 --> 14:49.240
- Am I being too, uh...
- Not at all.

14:52.330 --> 14:53.330
[Clary chuckles]

14:53.410 --> 14:55.516
So do you think anyone's
going to notice that we're...

14:55.540 --> 14:57.700
Only one way to find out.

14:57.790 --> 14:58.870
[Simon sighs]

14:58.960 --> 15:00.290
[Clary sighs]

15:01.050 --> 15:02.340
[chuckles]

15:02.420 --> 15:03.500
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.170
[indistinct chatter]

15:08.430 --> 15:09.810
[Spanish music playing]

15:16.480 --> 15:17.650
Can I get a beer.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.390
I thought I smelled cocky.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.400
Magnus must be really scraping the
bottom of the bartender barrel.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.200
Aw, you still bitter about getting
your ass kicked by a werewolf?

15:27.280 --> 15:30.450
In case you forgot,
that was a three-against-one fight.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.070
[sighs] Well, I'm actually happy
I didn't maul you to death.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.700
Why? So you can slowly
annoy me to death instead?

15:35.790 --> 15:37.170
No.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.460
Because now I know you
didn't kill Gretel.

15:43.050 --> 15:44.180
I asked for a beer.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.050
Beer's boring.
Have some sangria.

15:46.130 --> 15:48.130
Apparently Magnus has
a thing for Spain.

15:48.220 --> 15:49.486
[Simon] That is a
lot of Shadowhunters.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.130
Yeah, it's a Shadowhunter party.
Are you okay with that?

15:52.890 --> 15:55.190
Didn't think he had it in him.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.690
Guess your date
didn't go so well.

15:57.770 --> 15:59.900
No, it went great.

15:59.980 --> 16:03.390
I, uh, told him to make a move,
and that's exactly what he did.

16:05.490 --> 16:06.490
[sighs]

16:07.780 --> 16:10.160
[Jace] Hey. [Clary] Hey.

16:10.820 --> 16:11.820
Hey.

16:13.370 --> 16:16.540
- Well, you two look cute together.
- Thanks.

16:16.620 --> 16:17.806
We were just heading to the bar

16:17.830 --> 16:19.726
to see what kinds of
blood-types Magnus has on tap.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.410
Do you want anything?

16:22.750 --> 16:23.750
- [chuckles]
- I'm good.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.180
Okay.

16:27.170 --> 16:28.340
[chuckles]

16:29.510 --> 16:31.810
Well, I guess
congratulations are in order.

16:31.890 --> 16:32.890
I guess so.

16:34.430 --> 16:35.550
I'm happy for you.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.640
Thank you.

16:43.690 --> 16:50.110
Maia, um, I just wanted to say thank
you for being so cool about, you know...

16:50.200 --> 16:51.410
everything.

16:51.490 --> 16:54.160
Yeah, just don't screw it
up by talking too much.

16:55.450 --> 16:57.056
Uh, looks like it's
about time for my break.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.380
[chuckles]

17:01.710 --> 17:03.210
Is everything okay?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.290
I'll be right back.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.720
I'm worried the
empaÃ±adillas are soggy.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.560
- I gave the chef specific directions...
- Magnus.

17:12.470 --> 17:13.849
Everything is perfect.

17:16.430 --> 17:17.430
Max!

17:19.230 --> 17:20.270
Mother.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.060
I heard you like to drink.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.490
[chuckles] Welcome, Maryse.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.700
Max, this is your night.

17:35.830 --> 17:37.870
You do have exotic
taste, don't you?

17:37.950 --> 17:40.660
Oh, the Spanish theme is in
honor of you and your husband.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.210
Really? How so?

17:43.290 --> 17:45.460
Alec told me that Robert
proposed to you in Barcelona.

17:46.210 --> 17:50.630
I wanted to celebrate a joyous memory.
Especially since he couldn't be here.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.106
How sweet that Alec
feels comfortable

17:52.130 --> 17:54.460
sharing our personal
family stories with you.

17:54.550 --> 17:57.430
Especially considering your...
disparate backgrounds.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.180
How about a drink?

18:00.270 --> 18:04.070
Sangria for the lady,
a Roy Rogers for the guest of honor.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.240
Clary!

18:24.120 --> 18:26.540
- Clary! Hey, I've been looking for you.
- In Maia's arms?

18:26.630 --> 18:29.680
- No... Oh, no, you saw us.
- Yeah.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.760
Look, she kissed me. I...
I didn't know what to do.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.800
That's it? That's seriously
all you have to say?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.630
[stuttering] Look...

18:35.720 --> 18:38.850
What you said about not wanting
to risk the friendship...

18:39.600 --> 18:41.190
Maybe this is a mistake.

18:42.430 --> 18:43.970
So you make out with Maia?

18:44.060 --> 18:45.286
No, we weren't...
We weren't making out.

18:45.310 --> 18:48.060
[stuttering] We were just,
I don't know, having a moment.

18:48.730 --> 18:51.560
- I cannot believe this is happening.
- [stuttering] Look...

18:52.530 --> 18:55.040
Clary,
no matter how close we are,

18:56.530 --> 19:00.160
you will never understand what
it's like to live like this.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.070
But she does.

19:04.870 --> 19:06.290
She gets it.

19:09.630 --> 19:11.260
Then why did you even...

19:16.090 --> 19:18.510
Hey! What's going on, biscuit?

19:19.550 --> 19:20.550
It's Simon.

19:21.510 --> 19:24.390
He poured his heart out about
wanting to be with me, and then...

19:24.480 --> 19:26.520
[breathes shakily] he
hooks up with Maia.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.850
That doesn't sound like Simon.

19:27.940 --> 19:30.900
Are you sure you haven't had
too much sangria? It's strong.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.310
- I made sure of it.
- Please. I just need to leave.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.820
Hey, don't.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.216
We'll figure out what's
going on with Simon.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.830
But tonight's about Max.

19:39.450 --> 19:41.080
- [sniffling]
- And Alec and Izzy.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.766
You'll never forgive yourself if
you're not there for your friends.

19:43.790 --> 19:44.790
[softly] Okay.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.060
[gasps]

20:09.770 --> 20:12.980
Sorry. I'm just...
a little jumpy.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.480
Venom withdrawal.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.280
Saps the nerve endings.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.240
Oh, I'm totally fine.

20:22.370 --> 20:24.080
Why did you call me here?

20:25.250 --> 20:29.090
Your bite... it was so strong.
But then...

20:29.170 --> 20:31.840
Vampire venom is more
powerful than <i>yin fen.</i>

20:33.130 --> 20:35.470
It also wears off quicker.

20:35.550 --> 20:37.140
That's why it was
a one-time deal.

20:37.220 --> 20:39.060
Thought I made
that clear to you.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.840
I know. Look...

20:41.510 --> 20:45.010
I wouldn't have asked you to come
back if it wasn't an emergency.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.770
My mom's in town.

20:46.850 --> 20:48.930
I can't let her
see me like this.

20:49.020 --> 20:50.706
That's the best excuse
you can come up with?

20:50.730 --> 20:52.110
It's not an excuse.

20:52.190 --> 20:54.990
Excuses, justifications,
call it what you want.

20:55.070 --> 20:59.410
Trust me when I tell you, Isabelle,
sweat it out while you still can.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.910
- You don't understand.
- But I do.

21:01.990 --> 21:03.740
You can get through this.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.670
You're one of the strongest
Shadowhunters I know.

21:08.620 --> 21:09.910
No, I'm not.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.010
Everyone thinks I
am, but I'm not.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.010
Just a drop.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.270
Please.

21:25.350 --> 21:28.270
Shadowhunter blood is more
potent than human blood.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.570
Okay. I can't.

21:33.650 --> 21:34.690
[hisses]

21:37.320 --> 21:38.740
[grunts]

21:39.860 --> 21:41.900
[breathing heavily]

21:41.990 --> 21:43.290
Sure you can.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.370
Please.

21:51.870 --> 21:53.540
[groaning]

22:05.430 --> 22:07.190
I don't see anything.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.060
That's because you're
not looking hard enough.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.400
[Magnus chuckles]

22:13.480 --> 22:15.320
Congratulations,
young Shadowhunter.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.990
- What do you say, Max?
- Thank you.

22:20.780 --> 22:22.080
Where's your warlock mark?

22:23.030 --> 22:25.450
- [Alec] Max...
- You were just as curious at his age.

22:25.530 --> 22:26.820
It's okay.

22:27.450 --> 22:29.490
I only share with
my closest friends.

22:35.830 --> 22:38.210
- How much of you is a demon?
- Max, enough.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.790
That's not how we
treat our friends.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.380
- Apologize to Magnus.
- You can't tell me what to do.

22:43.470 --> 22:45.196
Hey, just because you're
getting your first rune

22:45.220 --> 22:47.076
doesn't mean you can talk
to your brother like that.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.390
Jace isn't my brother.

22:49.350 --> 22:50.400
Max!

22:50.470 --> 22:53.010
Mom says you're not
even part of our family.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.610
Jace, I...

23:00.730 --> 23:01.730
[sighs]

23:03.280 --> 23:04.280
This is your fault.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.610
I've tried to keep
Max out of it.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.960
The hell you have.
He learned this behavior from you.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.670
If you ever want to make
things right with me,

23:12.750 --> 23:14.230
you better make them
right with Jace.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.180
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

23:32.850 --> 23:34.440
There's nothing to talk about.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.770
I think there is.

23:36.730 --> 23:39.860
Max is right.
You're not his brother.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.480
What?

23:41.570 --> 23:44.410
You were a ten-year-old
left on our doorstep.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.580
We had no choice
but to take you in.

23:47.610 --> 23:49.860
But if I had known
you were a demon,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.170
I would've done this years ago.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.080
[both grunt]

24:09.680 --> 24:12.810
[Raphael] Isabelle, when your mom
leaves, disappear for a while.

24:13.890 --> 24:16.230
Bear the pain and get the
venom out of your system.

24:16.310 --> 24:17.770
But it feels so good.

24:17.850 --> 24:20.250
- You feel it, too. I know you do, Raphael.
- Yeah. Too well.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.440
When I first turned,
I fed on human blood.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.910
And I couldn't control myself.

24:28.490 --> 24:30.830
The more I had,
the more I craved.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.200
How did you stop?

24:33.280 --> 24:34.910
I met a certain warlock...

24:34.990 --> 24:37.700
who cared enough about a lost
vampire to help him regain his faith.

24:39.750 --> 24:40.760
Magnus.

24:41.540 --> 24:44.420
When I was a boy,
I went to church every Sunday.

24:45.340 --> 24:49.760
Magnus gave me the strength to...
understand that where I came from...

24:50.680 --> 24:52.140
wasn't gone forever.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.550
That I was that person.

24:56.310 --> 24:58.770
I just had to find myself again.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.930
I had no idea.

25:05.820 --> 25:06.860
Hey.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.190
Go. Be with your family.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.780
You have no idea how lucky
you are to have them.

25:21.250 --> 25:24.510
[sighs] Thank you
for walking me here.

25:25.420 --> 25:26.620
Thank you for everything.

25:30.510 --> 25:32.770
Are you sure you
don't want to come up?

25:32.840 --> 25:35.430
Uh, I'm not too big on
Shadowhunter parties.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.390
[Spanish music playing]

25:58.990 --> 26:00.370
[indistinct chatter]

26:02.870 --> 26:05.830
Izzy, hey. Where have you been?

26:07.590 --> 26:09.680
- Out.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.600
I feel horrible that I
kept the rune from you.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.100
I... I never meant to hurt you.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.770
I know.

26:16.850 --> 26:19.270
Good, because I really
need to talk to you.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.480
You ever think you
know someone so well,

26:22.560 --> 26:24.850
and then they start acting
completely out of character.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.850
Clary, I'm sorry, I...

26:27.940 --> 26:30.060
[sighs] I...
I don't have time for this.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.810
I'm looking for my mom and Max.

26:31.900 --> 26:34.650
- Can we talk later?
- Yeah.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.590
You have got to be kidding me.

26:43.830 --> 26:46.790
- Slow down, hotshot.
- Get out of my way, Magnus.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.630
Oh, no.
I'm not letting you make a scene.

26:48.710 --> 26:52.460
This is an elegant affair, not an
episode of <i>The Real Housewives of Idris.</i>

26:52.550 --> 26:54.146
Tell Simon that,
because I can't stand here

26:54.170 --> 26:56.340
while he hits on Maia
right in front of me!

27:01.600 --> 27:03.520
I think we have different
idea of courtship.

27:07.610 --> 27:09.610
Jace, I've been looking
everywhere for Mom and Max.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.166
- Have you...
- Maryse just tried to kill me.

27:11.190 --> 27:12.360
What?

27:16.860 --> 27:20.200
Magnus, I can't stay here, okay?
Everyone is acting completely insane.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.250
- I have to leave.
- Not while you're hallucinating.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.670
Stay right here while I
figure out what's going on.

27:32.710 --> 27:35.750
Hey, are you leaving?

27:39.260 --> 27:40.300
I have to.

27:42.010 --> 27:47.350
Seeing you here, drink in hand,
all smiles, it makes me sick.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.770
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you killing my mom.

27:57.150 --> 27:59.110
Oh, my God.
Jace, what did you do?

27:59.200 --> 28:00.840
I told you, Izzy,
I didn't have a choice.

28:04.540 --> 28:07.340
Okay, the sangria may
have been too strong.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.780
She just tried to kill
me, Magnus.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.370
This will help.

28:16.090 --> 28:17.630
She just threw an ax at my head.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.236
Okay, it's stuck in the
shelf, right there.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.060
See for yourself.

28:21.140 --> 28:22.600
Jace, there's nothing there.

28:24.850 --> 28:26.770
It's right there.
Why can't you see that?

28:27.730 --> 28:30.690
- [gasping]
- Mom, are you okay?

28:30.770 --> 28:32.916
Hey, hey, hey, don't let her up.
She's out of her mind.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.610
Jace, I came up here
to apologize to you.

28:35.690 --> 28:37.150
Then, why would you...

28:37.240 --> 28:39.790
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

28:40.990 --> 28:42.820
She just said it.
Don't you hear her?

28:43.620 --> 28:45.790
Listen to me.
Nobody's trying to kill you.

28:45.870 --> 28:48.160
You have to believe me.
Someone's playing with our minds.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.130
Feeding into our insecurities...

28:50.210 --> 28:52.630
[Clary] Alec. Alec, no!

28:55.630 --> 28:56.880
Alec...

28:57.880 --> 28:59.960
what are you doing?
You're scaring me.

29:01.590 --> 29:03.090
You're a murderer, Alec.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.640
Nothing more.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.640
Why are you still here?

29:11.850 --> 29:14.480
Alec, please,
come down from there.

29:15.820 --> 29:18.950
All those times you told me I
wasn't a good Shadowhunter...

29:19.030 --> 29:22.370
I know... I know you wish I
was dead instead of Jocelyn.

29:22.450 --> 29:24.910
I don't wish you were dead.
You let a demon possess you?

29:25.540 --> 29:27.380
You're weak. Please...

29:27.450 --> 29:29.240
Okay? Don't worry. Take my hand.

29:29.330 --> 29:30.420
Nobody's gonna miss you.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.010
Weak. The guilt must be eating you alive.
Take my hand.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.960
[echoing] Murderer.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.130
Alec!

29:40.590 --> 29:41.670
Alec!

29:42.340 --> 29:43.340
Oh, my God.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.020
What happened?

30:00.110 --> 30:03.570
All of a sudden, he started talking
about how I hated him for killing my mom.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.700
Alec?

30:04.780 --> 30:07.490
It's okay. I sedated him when
I pulled him from the ledge.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.766
You know what, you stay away from him.
You can't be trusted.

30:09.790 --> 30:11.000
I can't be trusted?

30:11.080 --> 30:14.370
Now you see why I was wary of
having a party at a warlock's house.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.526
- [stutters] Wow. What's going on here?
- Oh, what do you care?

30:17.550 --> 30:18.840
Maia is at the bar.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
Yes, and Alec's on the ground.

30:21.010 --> 30:23.390
- Is he gonna be okay?
- You're all gonna be okay.

30:23.470 --> 30:26.480
Everyone just stay here.
I'll be right back.

30:26.550 --> 30:28.550
[indistinct chatter]

30:39.230 --> 30:40.610
What did you say to my son?

30:40.690 --> 30:43.020
You don't think that Alec
feels guilty enough...

30:43.110 --> 30:45.716
You talked to Clary, didn't you?
That's why she's acting all weird.

30:45.740 --> 30:46.926
- Listen, I did nothing.
- You bring him up here...

30:46.950 --> 30:49.290
I did not bring him up
here, I followed him.

30:49.370 --> 30:51.630
[all arguing indistinctly]

30:52.580 --> 30:54.030
[speaking French]

31:00.460 --> 31:02.000
[grunts]

31:08.760 --> 31:10.260
[Jace] Mom...

31:10.350 --> 31:11.906
[Simon] Um, what's going on?
[Maryse] Jace.

31:11.930 --> 31:13.100
[Jace] You okay?

31:14.060 --> 31:15.400
- Simon...
- [sighs]

31:15.480 --> 31:17.036
[Maryse] I'm fine.
[Clary] I am so sorry.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.270
- [stutters] I know you didn't kiss Maia.
- You thought I kissed Maia?

31:20.360 --> 31:21.490
What happened here?

31:21.570 --> 31:24.050
It seems a warlock has been having
a little fun at our expense.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.110
[Maryse] Is he okay?

31:25.700 --> 31:27.330
[Simon] What happened?

31:27.410 --> 31:28.540
Alec...

31:31.450 --> 31:32.740
Someone has taken my spell book.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.670
You're putting your wards up?

31:40.750 --> 31:42.330
Nobody leaves until
I get it back.

31:50.930 --> 31:54.180
I was this close to
lining up a three-way...

31:55.270 --> 31:57.820
and you guys let
yourselves get spelled?

31:59.310 --> 32:00.940
Is he the last one?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.650
It appears I'm the
only warlock here.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.296
[Clary] Magnus, what happens if
we don't find your spell book?

32:06.320 --> 32:08.150
That's not an option
you want to explore.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.910
That book can undo every
spell I've ever cast.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.660
From the elementary
to the complex.

32:12.740 --> 32:14.570
In new and old languages...

32:17.040 --> 32:18.130
Champenois.

32:19.420 --> 32:22.050
It's an old French dialect.

32:22.130 --> 32:23.130
[speaking French]

32:25.050 --> 32:26.220
The red-haired cat.

32:33.510 --> 32:35.760
Magnus, what cat?

33:00.120 --> 33:01.250
[cat yowls]

33:06.380 --> 33:07.380
<i>Duratus!</i>

33:10.130 --> 33:13.090
I hate party crashers. [Grunts]

33:17.180 --> 33:18.640
[panting]

33:38.450 --> 33:39.910
[gasping]

33:45.040 --> 33:47.880
You haven't changed one bit since
the last time I saw you crawling

33:47.960 --> 33:49.710
from the ruins of la Bastille.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.430
Old French spells.

33:51.510 --> 33:52.770
Your favorite.

33:53.390 --> 33:55.140
- [whimpers]
- Where are my counterspells?

33:55.220 --> 33:57.930
[groans] Valentine!

33:59.850 --> 34:01.180
He has Madzie, too.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.260
If I don't go back,
I don't know what he'll do to her.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.560
What does Valentine want
with my counterspells?

34:08.650 --> 34:10.020
I don't know.

34:10.110 --> 34:13.400
[yelling] I don't know!

34:13.489 --> 34:14.870
[pants]

34:14.949 --> 34:18.920
All... all he said was that
I had to get them for him.

34:18.989 --> 34:23.040
And I wasn't to harm Clary,
or he'd make Madzie suffer.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.710
Magnus, please.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.370
I'm all Madzie has.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.960
Have mercy. [Panting]

34:30.050 --> 34:31.429
After everything you've done?

34:34.219 --> 34:35.389
Release them.

34:35.469 --> 34:36.600
[sighs]

34:44.980 --> 34:48.699
[panting] Clary Fairchild...
you made a blood oath.

34:49.730 --> 34:51.270
Find Madzie.

34:57.450 --> 34:59.290
She's the Clave's problem now.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.330
[Alec] Okay,
what is Valentine up to anyway?

35:05.420 --> 35:06.510
I don't know.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.320
[whispering] It's too dangerous.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.470
Jace, they're our family.
They need to know.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.770
Know what?

35:16.970 --> 35:18.390
The angel Ithuriel.

35:19.010 --> 35:21.890
Valentine was going to use him
to activate the Soul-Sword.

35:21.970 --> 35:24.600
He needs someone with pure
angel blood to activate it.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.576
- Well, that doesn't sound good.
- [Jace] It's not.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.140
With the Soul-Sword activated,

35:28.230 --> 35:30.310
Valentine could decimate
the entire Downworld.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.836
The angel showed us a vision of a
demon who could destroy the Sword.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.690
If we could find that demon,
we could stop Valentine.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.240
How did you two save the angel?

35:42.410 --> 35:44.620
With runes the angel gave to me.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.170
[Jace] New runes, Magnus.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.120
Ones no one's ever seen before.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.170
- Why did he choose you?
- I have no idea.

35:55.090 --> 35:56.210
[Magnus] I might.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.980
Years ago, a Silent Brother told
me about a special connection

36:01.060 --> 36:03.400
the original Shadowhunters
had with the Angel Raziel.

36:04.640 --> 36:09.100
That they could communicate
from afar through... visions.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.910
Because they were
created from his blood.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.770
Are you saying that...

36:17.610 --> 36:20.400
Clary may have a blood
connection to that angel.

36:20.490 --> 36:23.320
And that must mean she
has pure angel blood.

36:24.580 --> 36:27.090
That's why Valentine
wants Clary unharmed.

36:29.170 --> 36:31.170
Clary can activate
the Soul-Sword.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.850
[Simon] "Soul-Sword."

36:41.470 --> 36:44.380
Strange name for a weapon
of mass destruction.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.270
Simon, we're not going
to let him activate it.

36:46.980 --> 36:49.190
I'll do whatever it takes.

36:49.270 --> 36:52.740
Clary, you might be a Shadowhunter
with all kinds of crazy abilities,

36:52.820 --> 36:54.416
that doesn't mean you
can stop the inevitable.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.480
It's not inevitable, all right?
It can't be.

36:57.570 --> 36:59.330
Hey...

36:59.400 --> 37:03.780
this... news of a Downworld
apocalypse, it's not all bad.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.910
Because now,
it's clearer than ever...

37:09.370 --> 37:11.540
I want to spend every minute
of every day with you.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
[sighs]

37:21.640 --> 37:23.640
[Max] <i>To the Angel
I entrust my life...</i>

37:31.400 --> 37:33.690
<i>And vow to uphold
the laws of heaven.</i>

37:43.240 --> 37:45.150
<i>I take this mark to honor Him...</i>

37:52.920 --> 37:54.550
<i>To bring His light into me...</i>

37:58.800 --> 38:00.760
And vow to uphold
the laws of heaven.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.760
<i>So I may join the ranks
of the Shadowhunters...</i>

38:04.640 --> 38:06.440
the guardians of peace.

38:20.490 --> 38:22.200
[rune searing]

38:40.170 --> 38:42.880
Hey, you should know...

38:42.970 --> 38:44.560
Valentine's coming for
me, isn't he?

38:46.850 --> 38:49.890
Which means I'm never
letting you out of my sight.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.860
The ceremony was beautiful.

38:57.940 --> 39:00.850
- Yeah, Max did great, huh?
- Didn't even flinch.

39:03.490 --> 39:04.780
[sighs] Give me a minute.

39:08.160 --> 39:12.750
Alec, whatever you heard me say
when you were under the spell...

39:14.290 --> 39:18.300
you have to know,
I don't blame you for my mom.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.340
I don't.

39:31.850 --> 39:34.810
Maryse, look, I...
I just want you to know...

39:34.890 --> 39:36.350
I don't need any more apologies.

39:37.980 --> 39:39.560
Because you don't owe me one.

39:40.610 --> 39:43.700
I don't regret taking
you in for one second.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.080
Max was totally out of line,

39:47.160 --> 39:49.410
because I have been out of line.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.700
As a parent,
your greatest hope is that

39:53.790 --> 39:55.920
your children don't
inherit your worst traits.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.370
[Jace chuckles]

39:59.830 --> 40:03.830
[sighs] Yeah, well, Max is still young.
Impressionable.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.420
You can still steer
that ship straight.

40:06.510 --> 40:07.810
[chuckles]

40:09.180 --> 40:10.480
[Alec sighs]

40:11.470 --> 40:13.300
Max says that you and
Dad have been fighting.

40:13.390 --> 40:15.970
- [sighs]
- About me and Magnus.

40:16.060 --> 40:18.780
Max doesn't have any idea what's
going on between your father and me.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.270
Then what is it?

40:23.480 --> 40:25.940
I didn't want to
burden you all...

40:29.110 --> 40:30.860
[breathes heavily]

40:36.370 --> 40:37.620
Is Dad cheating on you?

40:42.630 --> 40:43.630
Bastard.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.170
You can't tell Isabelle.

40:47.260 --> 40:50.010
[sniffles] She worships Robert.

40:50.090 --> 40:52.010
I can bear it,
but it would destroy her.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.720
[sobbing]

41:01.360 --> 41:02.490
Come stay with us.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.890
You and Max.

41:04.690 --> 41:05.730
[sighs]

41:05.820 --> 41:07.500
You don't have to go
back to Idris or Dad.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.410
Oh... I wish I could stay...

41:13.910 --> 41:15.040
more than anything.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.210
[breathes heavily]

41:17.290 --> 41:19.040
But I have to get
back to the Clave.

41:19.120 --> 41:21.950
Why?
Let Robert take care of that.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.710
Everything's different now
because of Clary and the Sword.

41:26.630 --> 41:29.420
I can't let my problems
interfere with my duty.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.100
Not now.

41:49.610 --> 41:51.190
That's a good girl.

41:52.490 --> 41:56.080
You and Clarissa are going
to get along so well.
