02:20.840 --> 02:22.159
( growls )

02:32.880 --> 02:34.245
- SORRY.
- I'M GOING WITH--

02:34.350 --> 02:36.682
- ONLY FAMILY RIDES ALONG.
- I WON'T GET IN THE WAY.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.055
I CAN'T LET HIM GO ALONE.
- I'LL BE WITH HIM
THE WHOLE TIME.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.856
MA'AM, ALL YOU
CAN DO IS FOLLOW.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.451
- NATE--
- DON'T TRY TO KEEP UP.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.925
WE'LL BE RUNNING
THE RED LIGHTS.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.332
( siren wailing )

02:53.440 --> 02:55.590
NO! WAI--
I AM FAMILY!

02:55.700 --> 02:57.201
HE'S MY STEPBROTH ER!

03:12.920 --> 03:14.558
( beeps )

03:17.260 --> 03:19.319
( cell phone ringing )

03:23.370 --> 03:24.792
( ringing continues )

03:32.940 --> 03:34.498
( line rings )

03:34.610 --> 03:37.841
You have 45 minutes
and $300.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.817
- Go for it.
- Woman: You really
have to think...

03:40.920 --> 03:42.717
JUST FIVE MORE
MINUTES. OKAY?

03:42.820 --> 03:45.414
- OKAY.
- Woman: You have to meet
the needs of the client.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.489
For me, it set off just
a total panic attack.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.820
Man:
(bleep) ...I am glad
this final challenge is...

03:50.930 --> 03:52.750
- ( cell phone buzzing )
- ...an evening gown
because I think

03:52.860 --> 03:56.694
that is probably
my true speciality.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.165
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

03:58.270 --> 04:00.693
- David, it's Maggie.
- HI, MAGGIE.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.566
( sobbing )
NATE COLLAPSED
AT MY HOUSE.

04:04.670 --> 04:09.573
- NATE WHAT?
HE WH’lAJ-lh? WHY?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.602
- I DON'T KNOW.
- IS HE OKAY?

04:11.710 --> 04:14.645
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS STILL PASSED OUT.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.379
THE PARAMEDICS TOOK HIM.
CAN YOU MEET ME
AT THE HOSPITAL?

04:18.490 --> 04:20.549
- WHICH HOSPITAL?
- Saint Bridget's.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.855
- DAVID--
- I'M ON MY WAY.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.450
DAVID, COULD YOU
CALL BRENDA?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.598
YEAH.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.998
- ( beeps )
- TELL THEM AVM.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.897
- MAGGIE?
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO NATE?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.834
GET ME THE NUMBER
FOR SAINT BRIDGET'S
AND DR. DiPAOLO.

04:37.940 --> 04:40.636
D-I-P-A-O-L-O.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.776
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO
BE OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

04:44.880 --> 04:47.041
( phone ringing )

04:51.950 --> 04:53.952
WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU?

04:54.060 --> 04:56.324
- Brenda, it's David.
- DAVID, I'M SORRY.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.853
- Is Nate with you?
- HE'S AT SAINT BRIDGET'S.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.191
- Something happened to him--
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:02.300 --> 05:06.293
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
ANY OF THE DETAILS.
I JUST GOT A CALL.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.732
WHO CALLED YOU?
WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL ME?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.138
- CAN YOU COME?
- YEAH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

05:11.240 --> 05:12.901
BRENDA, I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO CALL MY MOM.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.672
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING
UNTIL YOU GET THERE.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.008
DAVID.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.446
( beeps )

05:23.290 --> 05:25.542
( sighs )

05:25.650 --> 05:27.550
( classical music
Playing )

05:27.660 --> 05:30.220
- Waiter:
ARE YOU READY YET?
- YOU'RE QUIET.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.854
( chuckles )
AM I? SORRY.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.090
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NICE TO BE
QUIET WITH SOMEBODY.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.095
DO YOU LIKE
THIS PLACE?

05:42.200 --> 05:44.339
YEAH. IT'S LOLY.

05:47.110 --> 05:47.974
BUT?

05:50.510 --> 05:52.842
( chuckles )
YOU CAN TELL ME.

05:52.950 --> 05:55.771
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HURT MY FEELINGS.
-(laughs)

05:55.880 --> 05:58.747
I JUST KIND OF FEEL
LIKE NANCY REAGAN
MIGHT WALK IN

05:58.850 --> 06:01.785
- AND SIT AT
THE NEXT TABLE.
-(laughs)

06:01.890 --> 06:05.223
YEAH, I THINK
WE'VE STUMBLED UPON
A REPUBLICAN NEST.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.696
I BELIEVE IT'S
CALLED AN ENCLAVE.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.529
NO NO,

06:09.630 --> 06:13.134
LIKE VAM PIRES,
A NEST.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.437
HERE THEY ARE,
SAFE IN THEIR FANCY
RESTAURANT BUBBLE

06:16.540 --> 06:18.633
WHILE THAT STUPID,
EVIL WAR GOES ON AND ON.

06:18.740 --> 06:21.300
- STUPID, EVIL,
I DON'T THINK SO.
- RIGHT.

06:21.410 --> 06:24.072
WE ELIMINATED A MURDERING
ASSHOLE DICTATOR.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.672
AND NOW WE'RE ESTABLISHING
DEMOCRACY WHICH, OF COURSE,
TAKES TIME.

06:27.780 --> 06:31.079
BUT WE HAVE TO
STABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE WAR WAS INEVITABLE.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.753
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.
- OF COURSE I'M SERIOUS.

06:44.730 --> 06:45.697
MA'AM.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.860
MA'AM?
WILL YOU COMPLETE
THIS, PLEASE?

06:53.810 --> 06:55.698
Woman on PA:
Physical Therapy
to Five West.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.745
Physical Therapy
to Five West.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.909
I DON'T KNOW IF HE
HAD A COLONOSCOPY

07:01.020 --> 07:03.011
OR WHAT HIS PATERNAL
GRANDMOTHER DIED OF.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.112
I DON'T-- I DON'T
KNOW THE ANSWERS
TO ANYTHING.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.518
HOW ABOUT HIS
INSURANCE PROVIDER?

07:08.620 --> 07:10.383
I DON'T KNOW.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.754
DO YOU HAVE
HIS WALLET?

07:12.860 --> 07:14.953
I DON'T KNOW.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.188
- MAYBE IT'S IN HIS JACKET.
IS THAT HIS JACKET?
- YEAH.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.131
( sniffles )

07:22.440 --> 07:23.668
OKAY.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.674
YOU DON'T THINK THEY
WANTED A FREE ELECTION?

07:27.780 --> 07:29.077
DID YOU SEE THOSE PICTURES?

07:29.180 --> 07:31.205
THEY WERE DANCING
IN THE STREETS, LITERALLY.

07:31.310 --> 07:34.518
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY WANTED TO BE
INVADED AND SLAUGHTERED.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.010
I SAW THE PICTURES FROM
ABU GHRAIB, TOO, AND NOBODY
WAS FUCKING DANCING THERE.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.112
- THAT WAS AN ISOLATED GROUP
OF DISTURBED INDIVIDUALS.
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

07:41.220 --> 07:45.224
THOSE ORDERS CAME DOWN
FROM THE TOP, THE TOP!
THERE'S MEMOS TO PROVE IT.

07:45.330 --> 07:46.524
WOW!

07:46.630 --> 07:49.861
THE WORLD IS CORRUPT.
HOW CAN THAT BE?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.528
FREEDOM ISN'T FREE.

07:51.630 --> 07:55.031
OH, GOD! WHAT ARE YOU?
SOME REDNECK BLOGGER PIG?

07:55.140 --> 07:57.404
COME ON.
NAME ONE RIGHT,
ONE CIVIL LIBERTY,

07:57.510 --> 08:00.502
THAT DOESN'T HAVE BLOOD
ALL OVER IT, THAT PEOPLE
HAVEN'T FOUGHT AND DIED FOR.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.340
WE DIDN'T GO TO WAR
TO PROTECT IRAQI
CIVIL LIBERTIES.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.613
- THAT'S JUST
A LAME JUSTIFICATION.
- I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS JUST.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.745
BUT THAT'S THE WAY
HUMAN BEINGS
MAKE PROGRESS.

08:08.850 --> 08:10.943
WE'RE VIOLENT.
IT'S OUR NATURE.

08:11.050 --> 08:13.655
IT'S A LITTLE NAIVE
TO EXPECT ANYTHING
DIFFERENT.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.752
SO YOU JUST
RATIONALIZED AWAY
ALL MORAL RESPONSIBILITY.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.487
- I GUESS YOU LEARNED
THAT IN LAW SCHOOL.
- ( cell phone ringing )

08:22.100 --> 08:23.124
WHAT?

08:29.770 --> 08:32.534
( sighs )
OH, NO.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.972
- Man:
HE'S STABLE FOR THE MOMENT.
- Maggie: IS HE CONSCIOUS?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.844
- NOT YET.
- I LLED HIS SPECIALIST,
DR. DiPAOLO,

08:37.950 --> 08:40.271
- BUT HE'S OUT OF TOWN.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.713
HIS RECORDS ARE COMING OVER
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM IN
FOR A CAT SCAN RIGHT AWAY.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.550
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
- HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY
ASYM PTOMATIC

08:46.660 --> 08:49.049
FOR TWO YEARS,
SINCE THE EMBOLIZATION?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.525
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

08:50.630 --> 08:54.225
AND IMMEDIATELY PRIOR,
ANY NAUSEA OR PAIN?

08:54.330 --> 08:57.128
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT HIS ARM.

08:57.230 --> 09:01.132
HAS THERE BEEN ANY RECENT
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL STRESS?

09:01.240 --> 09:05.028
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
I THINK HE'S BEEN
UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.209
BUT NOTHING PHYSICAL?

09:11.510 --> 09:12.875
EXCEPT...

09:12.980 --> 09:15.471
BEFORE HE FELL,
THERE WAS...

09:15.580 --> 09:17.787
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.

09:19.050 --> 09:22.019
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WOULD YOU
CHARACTERIZE IT

09:22.120 --> 09:23.758
AS EXTREME EXERTION?

09:26.460 --> 09:28.348
NO.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.599
NO, BUT...

09:30.700 --> 09:33.897
UM... THERE
WAS A CLIMAX.

09:35.470 --> 09:38.633
OKAY.
THAT'S HELPFUL.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.334
WHEN THERE'S
NEW INFORMATION,
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.941
PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.713

Pain Management.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.471
Dr. Klein,

09:49.580 --> 09:52.686
MY MOTHER'S
NOT ANSWERING
HER PHONE.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.350
I TRIED HER
AT YOUR FATHER'S.
SHE'S NOT THERE,

09:55.460 --> 09:57.018
NOT THAT SHE
WOULD BE, BUT...

09:59.090 --> 10:00.489
YOU WANT ME TO CALL
GEORGE AGAIN?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.591
- MAYBE HE COULD COME--
- NO. GOD, NO.

10:06.270 --> 10:09.489
- I'M LOOKING
FOR MY HUSBAND.
- I'M SO SORRY.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.331
- I KNOW.
- DAVID.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.329
- IS HE OKAY?
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.078
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.239
UM...

10:20.350 --> 10:24.946
I CALLED 9-1-1.
HE WAS AT MY HOUSE
WHEN HE COLLAPSED.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.881
HE CAME TO PICK
ME UP FOR CHURCH.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.515
THAT WAS LIKE
TWO HOURS AGO.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.384

10:32.490 --> 10:35.050

10:43.270 --> 10:45.704
OKAY, SO...

10:45.810 --> 10:47.903
WHAT, WE WAIT?

10:48.010 --> 10:49.034
YEAH.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.147
( overlapping voices )

10:59.890 --> 11:01.983
( radio playing )

11:09.460 --> 11:11.564
THIS WASN'T PLANNED,
YOU KNOW.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.537
- I KNOW.
- ( groans )

11:14.640 --> 11:16.801

11:40.330 --> 11:42.491
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.158
NOTHING.
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT ANYONE.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.694
I DON'T, EITHER.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.102
I WANT TO DO IT.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.217
( electricity crackles )

12:05.790 --> 12:08.213
Woman on PA:

12:13.030 --> 12:16.124
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS HE OKAY?

12:16.230 --> 12:20.530
HE'S IN RADIOLOGY.
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS YET.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.062
( sighs )
WHERE'S MOM?

12:22.170 --> 12:24.809
- I HAVEN'T REACHED HER.
- WHAT?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.799
- THAT SUCKS.
SHE SHOULD BE HERE.
- I KNOW.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.038
WHEN CAN WE SEE HIM?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.970
PROBABLY AFTER
THE CAT SCAN.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.469
LAST WE HEARD,
sHE WAS STILL
UNCONSCIOUS.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.054
OKAY.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.184
UM... THIS IS
MY FRIEND TED.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.588
- THIS IS
MY BROTHHEIR DAVID.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.089

HI.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.308
HI.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.819
WHY IS SHE HERE?

13:11.920 --> 13:13.148
( whispers )
LATER.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.780
( Hiram sighs)

13:18.890 --> 13:21.688
WHENEVER I SEE A FIRE,
I THINK OF YOU.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.121
IT REMINDS ME
OF THE COLOR
OF YOUR HAIR.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.960
SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE ALL I HAVE
GOING FOR ME

13:27.070 --> 13:28.264
IS THE COLOR
OF MY HAIR.

13:28.370 --> 13:31.237
IT REMINDS ME
OF YOUR SPIRIT...
( moans )

13:31.340 --> 13:34.070
YOUR SEXUAL SPIRIT.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.932
( grunts )

13:36.040 --> 13:38.941
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.870
LET'S TALK A LITTLE.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.948
WE'RE TALKING.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.610
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D LIKE?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.859
WHAT?

13:47.960 --> 13:51.282
I'D LIKE TO SEE
LIFE CLEARLY,

13:51.390 --> 13:53.699
BUT THAT'S THE FIRST THING
TO FLY OUT THE WINDOW

13:53.800 --> 13:56.621
WHEN I GET ROMANTIC.

13:56.730 --> 14:01.133
I WONDER IF THERE'S
A WAY TO DO IT WHERE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.936
( sighs )
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.565
YOU NEED TO JUST...

14:06.670 --> 14:09.173
LET THINGS FLOW.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.374
YOU CAME BACK TO ME
FOR A REASON.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.277
I DID?
WHAT REASON?

14:17.620 --> 14:18.541
THIS.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.450
THIS IS DR. FRAKER.
SHE'S NATE'S NEUROSURGEON.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.826
- NEUROSURGEON?
OH, GOD.
- WHAT DID YOU FIND?

14:29.930 --> 14:32.967
- THERE WAS A HEMORRHAGE
IN HIS BRAIN.
- HOW BAD?

14:33.070 --> 14:35.937
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
ANY HEMORRHAGE IS BAD,
BUT I'VE SEEN WORSE.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.338
WE NEED TO GET HIM
INTO THE O.R. AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.671
WAS IT ANOTHER AVM?
OR DID THE OTHER SURGERY
NOT WORK, OR WHAT?

14:41.780 --> 14:44.305
WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW
UNTIL WE GET IN THERE.
WE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW THEN.

14:44.410 --> 14:47.948
ARE THERE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS?
SOMETIMES THERE ARE.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.883
NOT THIS TIME.
WE HAVE TO STOP THE BLEEDING
BEFORE THERE'S MORE DAMAGE.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.617
- THERE'S DAMAGE?
- WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE?

14:52.720 --> 14:54.153
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
MAYBE NONE,

14:54.260 --> 14:57.388
BUT YOU SHOULD
PREPARE YOURSELVES
FOR POSSIBLE... CHANGES.

14:57.490 --> 15:00.493
- "CHANGES."
- WE REALLY NEED
TO SEE HIM.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.228
- YEAH.
- Doctor: I'M SORRY. WE NEED
TO MOVE ON THIS RIGHT NOW.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.366
Fraker:
I'LL TALK TO YOU
AS SOON AS WE FINISH.

15:05.470 --> 15:09.099
IT'S GOING TO BE
AT LEAST A FEW MORE HOURS.
SHOW TM TO THE WAITING ROOM.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.977
MRS. FISHER, COULD
YOU GO WITH DERRICK
AND SIGN THE PAPERS?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.105
sI'M NATE'S WIFE.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.705
H. UH...
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.448
IF EVERYONE
COULD FOLLOW ME.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.596
( sniffles )

15:47.010 --> 15:49.433
- ( objects clatter )
- FUCK.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.404
( sighs )

15:54.620 --> 15:56.247
( sighs )

15:56.350 --> 15:59.012
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.955
YOU HURT?

16:10.930 --> 16:13.592
( heavy sigh )

16:13.700 --> 16:15.167
FINE.
I GIVE UP.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.698
HOW COULD YOU SAY
I DON'T LOVE YOU?
HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT?

16:24.680 --> 16:27.774
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO THINK?
YOU TREAT ME LIKE SHIT.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.213
WE ALREADY ARGUED ABOUT THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO GO
THROUGH IT AGAIN.

16:33.790 --> 16:37.089
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOVE
SOMEONE WHO CHEATS ON YOU.
IT'S STUPID.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.886
IT'S WEAK.
I KNOW, BECAUSE I WORK
WITH THESE WOMEN.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.096
THEY GET THEIR HEARTS
BROKEN EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,
AND I WON'T BE LIKE THEM.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.725
I FUCKIN' REFUSE.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.764
IT WILL NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN.

16:50.870 --> 16:54.931
BUT THEN HERE I AM
IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH YOU,
AND I'M SO SCARED

16:55.040 --> 16:57.349
BECAUSE YOU'RE CLOSER
TO ME THAN MY SKIN.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.475
THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU'RE
A PART OF ME, RICO.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.249
I CAN'T EVER STOP
LOVING YOU.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.911
THAT'S WHY I TREAT
YOU LIKE SHIT.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.248
DON'T YOU GET IT?

17:13.600 --> 17:14.624
- ( sobs )
- GOT IT.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.635
( phone rings )

17:21.740 --> 17:24.038
David:
OKAY, RICO. BYE.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.835
( phone beeps )

17:25.940 --> 17:28.238
( sighs )

17:28.340 --> 17:30.706
I'M RUNNING OUT OF BATTERY
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

17:32.580 --> 17:34.411
HERE.
TAKE MINE.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.714
THANK YOU.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.217
WHERE COULD SHE BE?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.880
- SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER CELL?
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.254
( beeping )

17:47.230 --> 17:49.892
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHEN THEY TOOK HIM IN.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.467
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.066
I DON'T KNOW.

17:56.170 --> 17:58.559
I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE
TO CALL KEITH.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.313
OH, GOD, WHAT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER?

18:11.150 --> 18:14.051
THAT'S EXTREMELY
UN LIKELY.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.287
I'M SURE SHE'LL
CALL BACK SOON.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.687
I'M KIND OF FLIPPING.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.824
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.833
I THINK I'M GOING TO LEAVE.
SO WOULD SOMEONE GIVE ME
A CALL AND LET ME KNOW--

18:33.940 --> 18:37.341
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.248
YOU WERE WITH HIM.
YOU MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING
THAT NONE OF US DO.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.792
DID HE JUST PASS OUT?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.357
WHAT WERE
YOU GUYS DOING?

18:56.460 --> 18:57.722
NOTHING.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.136
TALKING.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.403
DID HE SAY SOMETHING?
WAS HE NOT FEELING WELL?

19:04.510 --> 19:06.239
COULD YOU TELL
SOMETHING WAS WRONG?

19:06.340 --> 19:08.399
NO, HE WAS FINE
TILL HE...

19:08.510 --> 19:12.378
DID HE HAVE HIS PHONE ON?
'CAUSE I CALLED
LIKE 20 TIMES.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.519
- HOW LONG WERE
YOU GUYS TALKING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.756
OH?

19:24.860 --> 19:27.624
WELL, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A GREAT CONVERSATION.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.288
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

19:29.400 --> 19:31.288
HIS DAUGHTER
AND HIS PREGNANT WIFE?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.434
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO STAY.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.879
- I KNOW.
- I MEAN IT.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.777
I'VE GOT PEOPLE
HERE FOR SUPPORT.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.570
RIGHT.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.545
( sighs, laughs )

19:56.960 --> 19:59.224
- Hiram: OH, GOD,
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.797
OH, WAIT. OW!

20:00.900 --> 20:03.095
I'VE FANTASIZED
ABOUT ANOTHER NIGHT
WITH YOU IN THE WOODS,

20:03.200 --> 20:06.021
KISSING YOU EVERYWHERE,
YOUR SOFI', WHITE SKIN.

20:06.130 --> 20:07.939
THERE'S A ROCK
RIGHT UNDER ME.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.168
- DID YOU THINK ABOUT ME EVER?
- IF YOU COULD JUST
SHIFT THIS WAY.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.477
TELL ME YOU MISSED ME.
OH, GOD, YOU FEEL
WONDERFUL.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.901
- YOU'RE TOO HEAW. PLEASE.
- WOULD YOU HOLD ME?

20:16.010 --> 20:19.377
- I CAN'T BREATHE. MOVE.
- I WANT YOU NAKED.
SAY MY NAME.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.948
- HIRAM!
- YES, YES.

20:22.050 --> 20:25.349
- GET OFF ME!
- WHAT?

20:26.650 --> 20:27.810
I CAN'T DO THIS.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.581
OH!

20:39.930 --> 20:41.830
( phone ringing )

20:52.280 --> 20:53.838
( beeps )

20:57.650 --> 21:00.687
HEY, WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO GO DOWN
TO THE CAFETERIA

21:00.790 --> 21:03.054
AND GET YOU SOME TEA
OR REAL FOOD?

21:03.160 --> 21:05.481
NO, I'M GOOD
WITH THESE.
THANKS.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.122
- ( sighs )
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

21:11.230 --> 21:13.460
- WITH THE PREGNANCY?
- OH. GOOD, GOOD.

21:13.570 --> 21:16.892
NO MORNING SICKNESS.
SHE'S KICKING
LIKE A HORSE.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.558
SHE?

21:18.670 --> 21:21.707
YEAH. YEAH,
IT'S A GIRL.

21:21.810 --> 21:23.846
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANKS.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.372
- HAVE YOU PICKED A NAME?
- WELL, THE ONLY ONE

21:25.480 --> 21:29.348
THAT NATE AND I COULD
AGREE ON IS WILLA.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.044
WILLA?
THAT'S PRETTY.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.380
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

21:34.490 --> 21:38.426
- A LITTLE SISTER
FOR MAYA.
- YEAH.

21:38.530 --> 21:41.954
ANTHONY AND DURRELL
HAVE SUCH A BOND.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.324
I REALLY ADMIRE
YOUR CHOICE.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.864
YOU DIDN'T GO
FOR THE PERFECT
LITTLE INFANT.

21:46.970 --> 21:50.064
WELL, WE WENT FOR IT.
WE JUST DIDN'T GET IT.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.263
AND I'M TOTALLY GLAD
WE DIDN'T

21:52.370 --> 21:55.168
BECAUSE THESE KIDS
NEED US

21:55.280 --> 21:57.236
AND I LOVE THEM
TO DEATH.

21:57.350 --> 22:01.116
I DIDN'T KNOW I'D FEEL
LIKE THIS, LIKE A LIONESS
WITH MY CUBS.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.517
Man on PA:
Dr. Hoffman 308.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.713
Dr. Hoffman, call 308.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.186
THEN THERE ARE DAYS
I WANT TO KILL THEM.

22:07.290 --> 22:08.951
WELL, THAT'S PART
OF THE FUN.

22:13.190 --> 22:14.521
( sighs )

22:20.870 --> 22:22.633
( Hiram snoring )

22:37.050 --> 22:39.086
( phone ringing )

22:42.290 --> 22:43.928
( door opens )

22:46.890 --> 22:49.597
- IS HE OKAY?
- WAS IT THE AVM?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.395
LET ME TELL YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW
UP FRONT,

22:51.500 --> 22:53.468
AND THEN I'LL
TRY TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS.

22:53.570 --> 22:56.698
HE DEVELOPED A NEW AVM.
THAT'S WHAT RUPTURED

22:56.800 --> 22:59.132
AND CAUSED SOME HERNIATION
AND SWELLING IN THE BRAIN.

22:59.240 --> 23:02.801
WE DID MANAGE TO STOP
THE BLEEDING AND TO RELIEVE
THE CRANIAL PRESSURE...

23:04.180 --> 23:05.738
BUT THERE WERE
SOME PROBLEMS

23:05.850 --> 23:08.216
WITH HIS HEART RATE
AND HIS BREATHING.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.039
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- HE'S IN A COMA.

23:11.150 --> 23:14.278
THERE MAY BE SOME LONG-TERM
EFFECTS FROM EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

23:14.390 --> 23:18.224
WE WON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN
UNTIL HE WAKES UP, AND WE
DON'T KNOW WHEN HE WILL.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.820
JESUS.

23:19.930 --> 23:23.058
- SO HE COULD BE
IN A COMA FOR...?
- DAYS, WEEKS.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.469
WHAT KIND
OF LONG-TERM EFFECTS?

23:25.570 --> 23:28.164
LOSS OF VISION,
MEMORY,

23:28.270 --> 23:30.534
IMPAIRMENT OF SPEECH,
MOVEMENT.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.403
BUT YOU CAN LEARN HOW
TO SPEAK AND WALK AGAIN.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.831
MY GRANDFATHER
HAD A STROKE,
AND HE DID.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.033
Fraker:
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.870
BUT, LIKE I SAID, WE ARE
NOT GOING TO KNOW ANYTHING
UNTIL HE'S CONSCIOUS.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.016
WE REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.647
ONCE HE'S
OUT OF RECOVERY.
IF ALL GOES WELL,

23:45.750 --> 23:47.889
WE'LL TRANSFER HIM
TO THE NEURO STEP-DOWN
UNIT IN THE MORNING.

23:47.990 --> 23:51.289
BUT LET'S JUST GET HIM
THROUGH THE NIGHT
FIRST, OKAY?

23:51.390 --> 23:53.893
- HOLD GOOD THOUGHTS.
- David: THANK YOU,
DR. FRAKER.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.696
THANK YOU FOR
THE WORST FUCKING NEWS
I EVER HEARD.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.137
( sobbing )

24:09.310 --> 24:10.971
HE'S ALIVE.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.775
THAT'S SOMETHING.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.442
( Brenda sighs )

24:19.550 --> 24:21.279
( monitors beeping )

24:21.390 --> 24:23.654
- Brenda:
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HER?
- Nate: YES.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.127
Brenda:
YOU'RE SO FUCKING
PREDICT ABLE.

24:27.230 --> 24:28.925
- IT WASN'T ABOUT THE SEX.
- OH, RIGHT, YOU FUCKED HER

24:29.030 --> 24:33.421
- BECAUSE OF SILENCE
AND MEANING AND GOD.
- YEAH.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.029
WE'RE ALWAYS HAVING
A HARD TIME.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.938
THERE'S ALL THIS
PAIN AND ANGER
AND STRUGGLE HERE.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.406
I USED TO THINK
IT WAS PASSION,
BUT IT'S JUST DRAMA.

24:44.510 --> 24:46.375
YOU CAME TO ME.
I HAD MY OWN FUCKING LIFE

24:46.480 --> 24:49.119
BEFORE YOU TURNED UP
ON THE DOORSTEP,
BLEEDING AND CRAZY.

24:49.220 --> 24:52.519
- REMEMBER?
- I REMEMBER.
WE HAVE TO FACE THE TRUTH.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.814
WE DON'T FIT.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.388
WE NEVER HAVE.
WE WEREN'T MEANT TO BE.

24:58.490 --> 25:00.424
"MEANT TO BE"?

25:00.530 --> 25:03.351
WHAT QUAKER BULLSHIT.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.724
YOU THINK YOU AND MAGGIE
ARE MEANT TO BE

25:05.830 --> 25:07.661
AFTER YOU SLEPT
WITH HER, WHAT, ONCE?

25:07.770 --> 25:10.967
- WHAT ARE YOU, 15?
- NO, I'M 40 YEARS OLD.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.906
AND I SEE THAT THERE
CAN BE PEACE BETWEEN
A MAN AND A WOMAN,

25:15.010 --> 25:18.400
- AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
- FINE.

25:18.510 --> 25:20.171
GO FOR IT.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.317
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING
TO BEG YOU TO STAY.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.513
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO ASK YOURSELF,

25:25.620 --> 25:27.087
"WHAT KIND
OF PERSON AM I?"

25:27.190 --> 25:31.320
WHAT KIND OF MAN BETRAYS
HIS PREGNANT WIFE
AND LEAVES HER?

25:31.430 --> 25:34.092
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.
YOU KNOW IT IS.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.191
( monitors beeping )

25:46.770 --> 25:49.000
( monitors beeping )

25:59.120 --> 26:00.656
NATE.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.955
NURSE, HE'S AWAKE.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.584
NATE.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.555
- I'LL GO GET THE DOCTOR.
- NATE.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.721
NATE.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.934
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

26:18.640 --> 26:20.437
BRENDA.

26:20.540 --> 26:23.236
( sobs )

26:23.340 --> 26:25.774
YOU HAD A CEREBRAL
HEMORRHAGE.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.940
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
IN A COMA FOR MONTHS, BUT...

26:29.050 --> 26:31.610
- ( exhales )
- ...HERE YOU ARE.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.985
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
MY ARM AND MY LEG?

26:37.090 --> 26:40.696
WELL, THEY SAID
YOU MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS
JUST FOR AWHILE.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.864
- MAYA?
- SHE'S WITH MY MOTHER.

26:49.270 --> 26:50.828
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.002
( sighs )

26:58.980 --> 27:01.175
YOU WERE WITH MAGGIE.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

27:03.990 --> 27:07.482
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
STEP OUT, MRS. FISHER.

27:07.590 --> 27:09.251
WE'RE GOING TO
RUN SOME TESTS.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.659
- HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?
- A LITTLE WHILE.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.751
HERE.
LET ME HELP YOU.

27:16.530 --> 27:19.590
Brenda:
I'M GOING TO GO TELL
EVERYBODY YOU'RE AWAKE.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.396
CHUCK, GET BACK
IN THAT BED.

27:23.570 --> 27:25.333
BREN DA?

27:25.440 --> 27:28.637
I THINK IT'S VERY CHILDISH
THAT YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING
TO ME, HIRAM.

27:28.740 --> 27:32.506
- BUT SUIT YOURSELF.
- I DON'T WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING I'LL REGRET.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.841
GO AHEAD.
WHAT'S ONE MORE REGRET?
I'M FULL OF THEM.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.919
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK IT WAS RUDE
AND SELFISH OF YOU

27:39.020 --> 27:40.647
TO LEAVE THE TENT
LAST NIGHT.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.716
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME
FOR LEAVING THE TENT.

27:42.820 --> 27:46.028
- YOU'RE MAD AT ME
FOR NOT HAVING SEX.
- WELL, YES.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.223
YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT CAME INTO THE SALON.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.890
THEN YOU SEDUCED ME WITH
THE PROMISE OF APERITIFS.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.592
THEN IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO GO CAMPING.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.634
YOU LED ME ON,
THEN PUSHED ME AWAY.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.537
I FEEL REJECTED
AND HUMILIATED.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.528
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO LEAD YOU ON.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.562
I WANTED TO WANT
TO HAVE SEX IN THE TENT,

28:00.670 --> 28:04.276
- BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN
TO IT, I COULDN'T.
- COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T?

28:04.380 --> 28:07.543
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
JUST LIE THERE WHILE YOU
DO WHATEVER?

28:07.650 --> 28:09.277
I AM NOT
A RECEPTACLE.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.986
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
YOU COULD HAVE DONE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN OFFER.

28:13.090 --> 28:16.082
- DO YOU MEAN ORAL?
- YES, OR A HAND JOB.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.181
HIRAM, A WOMAN HAS
TO BE IN THE MOOD

28:18.290 --> 28:20.087
TO DO THAT STUFF,
OR IT'S JUST NO GOOD.

28:20.190 --> 28:22.920
I'M A SENSITIVE MAN,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE NEEDS.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.794
YOUR NEEDS ARE NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY!

28:28.340 --> 28:31.832
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
YOU CAN'T SURVIVE OUT
HERE ON YOUR OWN.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.771
YOU HAVE
NO WILDERNESS SKILLS.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.098
OH, GO GIVE YOURSELF
A HAND JOB!

28:39.110 --> 28:41.249
- David:
WHERE'S DR. FRAKER?
- SHE WENT HOME.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.739
I'M HER ASSOCIATE.
I'M FOLLOWING NATE
AT THE MOMENT.

28:43.850 --> 28:47.308
- WE CAN TALK, OR YOU
COULD WAIT TO TALK--
- NO, NO MORE WAITING.

28:47.420 --> 28:51.322
OKAY, WHAT NATE HAD
WAS CALLED AN ARTERIAL
VENOUS MALFORMATION.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.419
- WE KNOW.
- OH.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.658
- HE HAD ONE BEFORE.
- OH.

28:55.760 --> 28:59.127
UM... OH, RIGHT.
HERE IT IS.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.596
WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME
IS THIS AVM RUPTURED,

29:01.700 --> 29:02.837
CAUSING HERNIATION
AND BLEEDING.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.635
WE KNOW.
WE'VE BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT.

29:04.740 --> 29:07.538
SO YOU KNOW THE OPERATION
WENT WELL AND HE WAS
IN A COMA BRIEFLY?

29:07.640 --> 29:09.232
- YES, WE KNOW.
- HOW IS HE NOW?

29:09.340 --> 29:11.501
HIS VITALS ARE STABLE,
AND EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD,

29:11.610 --> 29:14.511
EXCEPT FOR A WEAKNESS
ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE, NATE.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.747
- ( sighs )
- YEAH.

29:16.850 --> 29:19.546
WHAT ABOUT
PHYSICAL THERAPY?

29:19.650 --> 29:21.356
WE'LL START AS SOON
AS HE'S UP TO IT.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.553
WHEN DO YOU THINK
HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?

29:23.660 --> 29:26.424
A WEEK OR TWO,
IF HE CONTINUES
TO IMPROVE.

29:26.530 --> 29:30.557
- THAT'S NOT LONG.
- YES.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.321
( Claire sighs )
ARE YOU OKAY?

29:33.530 --> 29:35.589
I AM NOW.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.669
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

29:38.770 --> 29:42.638
Doctor:
YOU PUT UP A GREAT FIGHT.
WE'RE ALL PROUD OF YOU.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.776
I'VE GOT A LOT
TO LIVE FOR.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.380
Claire:
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

30:04.370 --> 30:08.158
Woman on PA:
Dr. Klein, call
Pain Management.

30:08.270 --> 30:09.567
Dr. Klein,
call Pain Management.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.600
I KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE MAYA.
I'LL GO PICK HER UP.

30:17.710 --> 30:18.972
THAN KS.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.989
( sighs )

30:43.040 --> 30:45.565
RUTH, YOU CAME TO ME
FOR A REASON.

30:47.070 --> 30:48.537
- YEAH, THIS.
- ( groans )

30:48.640 --> 30:51.074
- ( bell rings )
- ( circus music playing )

30:51.180 --> 30:53.444
RUTHIE, BRING ME
MY LUNCH.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.745
- ( bell rin
- OH!QS)

30:57.850 --> 31:00.148
I CARE FOR YOU.
LET'S RUB HEADS.

31:00.250 --> 31:03.458
- ( shudders )
' ( gasps )

31:03.560 --> 31:06.256
IT'S PERFECT LY NORMAL
TO LIVE IN A BOMB SHELTER.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.855
_ - OH!
( bell rings )

31:12.930 --> 31:14.659
I'M YOUR FIRST
LOVE, RUTH,

31:14.770 --> 31:16.965
THE FATHER
OF YOUR CHILDREN.

31:17.070 --> 31:20.528
I'M WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.631
OH, NATHANIEL.
( laughs )

31:27.750 --> 31:29.672
( groans )

31:29.780 --> 31:32.578
( sighs )

31:36.590 --> 31:38.820
Chuck:
GO ON, DURRELL,
IT'S YOUR PLAY.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.455
HEY HEY HEY!
QUIET, ALL RIGHT?

31:41.560 --> 31:44.358
SO WE DON'T GET BUSTED
BY HAVING TOO MANY
VISITORS IN THE ROOM.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.325
- OKAY.
- BE CAREFUL, DURRELL.
CHUCK'S A SHARK.

31:47.430 --> 31:49.136
THERE YOU GO.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.902
ANTHONY, COME TALK
TO YOUR UNCLE NATE.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.434
IS THIS TOO MUCH
ACTION FOR YOU?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.178
NO, NO, IT'S GOOD.

31:57.280 --> 32:00.841
- THEY WANTED TO
COME AND SEE YOU.
- NO, I DIDN'T.

32:00.950 --> 32:02.372
David:
ANTHONY.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.211
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
YOUR ARM AND YOUR LEG.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.650
IT FEELS STRANGE.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.786
I HAVE TO REALLY CONCENTRATE
TO MAKE ANYTHING HAPPEN.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.790
BUT IT'S NOT
PERMANENT.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.960
THERE'S A COP I KNOW.
THEY SAID HE WOULD NEVER
GET OUT OF A WHEELCHAIR.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.425
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOW HE'ﬁlRILIJNNING.

32:20.530 --> 32:23.033
- Durrell:
HA! IWON!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:23.140 --> 32:25.028
WHOA, WHOA.
SHH!

32:25.140 --> 32:26.664
YOU OWE ME A DOLLAR.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.307
David:
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
ANYBODY'S MONEY.

32:31.510 --> 32:33.671
WHERE'S ANTHONY?

32:33.780 --> 32:35.042
HE WAS RIGHT HERE.

32:38.320 --> 32:41.050
- ANTHONY,
COME BACK HERE.
-(laughs)

32:41.160 --> 32:43.617
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.427
I'LL THINK OF A WAY.

32:46.530 --> 32:48.555
NO, I MEAN IT.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.823
I MEAN, HOW MANY GUYS
WOULD SPEND THE NIGHT

32:51.930 --> 32:54.694
IN A HOSPITAL
ON THE FIRST DATE?

32:57.200 --> 33:00.704
I MEAN, THAT IS JUST
FUCKING GOODNESS.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.375
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE LIKE THAT.
- NOT A BIG DEAL.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.347
YOU'D DO THE SAME THING
FOR ME, WOULDN'T YOU?

33:10.380 --> 33:11.586
I WOULD NOW.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.324
THANK YOU.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.351
YOU'RE WELCOME.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.699
YOUR BROTHER'S FINE.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.142
David: ALL I COULD
THINK ABOUT DURING
THE PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

33:39.250 --> 33:41.616
WAS HOW MUCH I WANTED
TO SMOKE A JOINT.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.518
( laughs)
UM...

33:46.720 --> 33:50.019
- MAGGIE.
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.486
NO. PLEASE.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.649
I WON'T STAY.
I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.455
STAY.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.768
I'M SURE MY BOYS
ARE CREATING
MAYHEM SOMEWHERE.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.269
I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE BIT.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.204
- HI.
- HI.

34:08.310 --> 34:10.778
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:10.880 --> 34:13.769
SWEAR TO ME.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.075
I SWEAR.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.410
IF ONLY I HADN'T
ASKED YOU FOR A RIDE.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.681
HEY...

34:20.790 --> 34:22.485
I'M NOT SORRY
FOR ANYTHING.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.556
YOU'RE MAKING LOVE
WITH SOMEBODY AND YOUR
HEAD EXPLODES.

34:27.660 --> 34:30.823
- THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
-(laughs)
STOP IT.

34:30.930 --> 34:34.093
YOU'RE AWFUL.

34:34.200 --> 34:36.668
I'M SO RELIEVED.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.203
LAST NIGHT WAS JUST...

34:38.310 --> 34:40.562
100 YEARS LONG.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.745
SO MANY THINGS I WANT TO SAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.169
JUST REST.

34:51.820 --> 34:54.459
( knocks )

34:54.560 --> 34:56.687
- OH, HEY, MAGGIE.
- HI, RICO.

35:00.130 --> 35:02.724
TAKE CARE, NATE.
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.333
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:17.180 --> 35:20.206
MAN, OH, MAN, OH, MAN.
WHAT THE HELL, NATE?

35:20.310 --> 35:23.575
- PRETTY FUCKIN' BIZARRE, HUH?
- DAVID TOLD ME, BUT I
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

35:23.680 --> 35:27.081
- I MEAN, YOU WERE FINE.
- I'M STILL FINE.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.454
WHAT A SHOCK.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.256
I HAD TO COME BY,
BUT I ONLY GOT A MINUTE.

35:32.360 --> 35:36.091
THERE'S AN INTAKE.
THIS GUY GOT MAULED
BY A COUGAR.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.590
- NO SHIT.
- YEAH, RIGHT HERE IN LA.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.964
HE WAS WALKING
IN THE CANYON.

35:42.070 --> 35:44.903
( sighs )

35:45.010 --> 35:48.400
- THE ECOTONE.
- HMM?

35:48.510 --> 35:51.377
ECOTONE.
IT'S THE AREA

35:51.480 --> 35:53.505
WHERE TWO ECOLOGICAL
WORLDS OVERLAP.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.748
YOU KNOW, LIKE WILDERNESS
AND CIVILIZATION.

35:57.850 --> 36:00.011
HMM, ECOTONE.

36:00.120 --> 36:03.487
- MM-HMM.
- I'LL BE SURE TO SAY
THAT IN THE INTAKE.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.332
( Chinese music
Playing )

36:29.620 --> 36:31.383
- EXCUSE ME.
I NOTICE YOU HAVE A BUS.
- ( speaking Chinese )

36:36.390 --> 36:40.383
COURTNEY.
COURTNEY.

36:40.490 --> 36:43.425
PLEASE, SOMEBODY.
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.330
HI. I'M COURTNEY.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

36:53.040 --> 36:55.031
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.973
FINE.
THEN DON'T EAT.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.570
- I'LL TAKE HIS.
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

37:05.550 --> 37:07.586
WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO CRAZY?

37:07.690 --> 37:11.057
WE ARE STAYING WITH
UNCLE NATE UNTIL WE ARE
SURE THAT HE IS BETTER.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.821
MAN, IT'S OKAY.
JUST CHILL.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.522
NO!

37:14.630 --> 37:17.451
- HEY, GET BACK HERE.
- HE'S GOING FOR
THE FRONT DOOR.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.790
DURRELL, STAY HERE
AND HELP ME CLEAN THIS UP.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.862
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?
- ARE YOU BLIND?

37:24.970 --> 37:28.371
HE HATES HOSPITALS.
WE ALWAYS HAD TO GO
WHEN MAMA O.D.'D.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.808
- WHY DIDN'T HE TELL US?
- YOU DIDN'T ASK.

37:32.910 --> 37:36.141
CAN I GO GET HIM NOW?

37:36.250 --> 37:37.478
YEAH.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.385
Brenda:
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.650
- DADDY!
- HEY.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.593
HEY, BIG GIRL.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.692
COME ON UP.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.506
COME HERE.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.963
GIVE ME A BIG HUG,
WOULD YOU?
COME HERE.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.305
I AM VERY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

38:12.050 --> 38:16.089
- ( sighs )
- WHY DON'T YOU READ
YOUR BOOK, HONEY?

38:16.190 --> 38:17.817
YOU BROUGHT
A BOOK, HUH?

38:22.930 --> 38:26.525
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE CHURCH
LAST NIGHT...

38:26.630 --> 38:29.292
- ( pages turning )
- ...WHEN YOU AND MAGGIE
WERE...

38:29.400 --> 38:30.628
TALKING.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.932
- ( sighs )
- I TOLD YOU TO GO
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.007
I GUESS YOU DID.

38:40.510 --> 38:43.479
I'M SORRY.
I NEVER WANTED IT
TO GO THIS WAY.

38:43.580 --> 38:46.913
LISTEN.
( sighs )

38:47.020 --> 38:49.386
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT,

38:49.490 --> 38:50.718
THINKING AND...

38:54.360 --> 38:55.691
YOU'RE ALIVE.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.325
THAT'S ALL THAT
REALLY MATTERS.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.761
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH WORSE
TOGETHER, I GUESS,

39:04.870 --> 39:06.906
AND WE'LL GET
THROUGH THIS, TOO.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.104
I DON'T THINK SO.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.281
WHAT?

39:20.390 --> 39:21.755
NOT TOGETHER.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.494
- ARE YOU SAYING WHAT
I THINK “YEARS! SAYING?

39:43.210 --> 39:46.907
UH...

39:47.010 --> 39:51.481
- WHAT ABOUT MAYA?
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.740
THAT'S A FUTURE
CONVERSATION.

40:00.330 --> 40:02.628
SO THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE DONE?

40:04.970 --> 40:06.824
(sighs)
UM...

40:06.930 --> 40:10.798
WE'RE-- WE'RE NOT
EVEN GOING TO TRY?

40:10.900 --> 40:12.606
WE'VE BEEN TRYING.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.676
BOTH OF US,
FOR A LONG TIME.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.349
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

40:20.450 --> 40:22.543
WE'RE JUST DIFFERENT,
THAT'S ALL.

40:25.350 --> 40:28.751
YEAH. YOU'RE
A NARCISSIST.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.487
I DON'T EVEN THINK
YOU'RE CAPABLE

40:30.590 --> 40:33.821
OF COMMITTING TO ANYBODY
OR ANYTHING, EVEN YOURSELF.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.457
I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.563
I AM SO TIRED
OF FIGHTING.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.608
( heavy sigh )

40:53.710 --> 40:55.678
( speaking Chinese )

40:55.780 --> 40:57.919
DO YOU REALLY WANT
A HUSBAND AGAIN?

40:58.020 --> 41:01.649
MAYBE. I DON'T
REALLY FEEL ANY BETTER
AS A SINGLE WOMAN.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.320
( translating in Chinese )

41:04.420 --> 41:06.354
HMM.

41:06.460 --> 41:10.157
( speaking Chinese )

41:10.260 --> 41:14.424
- DID THE CRAZY
HUSBAND BEAT YOU?
- OH, NO, NO.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.100
HE'S A GENTLE PERSON,

41:17.200 --> 41:18.736
SOMETIMES BORING.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.139
I THINK HE
MAY WANT A MOTHER
MORE THAN A WIFE.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.539
( speaking Chinese )

41:26.350 --> 41:28.375
( speaking Chinese )

41:28.480 --> 41:30.414
THEY'RE ALL LIKE THAT.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.283
HAVE YOU HAD
OTHER BOYFRIENDS?

41:32.390 --> 41:34.517
YES, UNFORTUNATELY.

41:34.620 --> 41:37.714
( speaking Chinese )

41:40.530 --> 41:42.953
- ( Courtney laughs )
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

41:43.060 --> 41:45.927
ALL MEN ARE CRAZY.
STICK WITH THE DEVIL
YOU KNOW.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.689
WHERE THE FUCK
COULD MOM BE?

41:50.800 --> 41:53.360
- SORRY, CHUCK.
- Chuck: THAT'S OKAY.

41:53.470 --> 41:56.439
I'M A BUDDHIST.
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT SHIT.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.132
( chuckles )

41:58.240 --> 42:01.471
FIRST, I WAS WORRIED,
BUT NOW I'M JUST PISSED.

42:01.580 --> 42:04.708
IT'S REALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE OF HER.

42:04.820 --> 42:08.779
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO HANDLE IT, ANYWAY.

42:08.890 --> 42:11.381
YOU KNOW, SHE'D
GET ALL UPSET

42:11.490 --> 42:14.823
AND FLAP AROUND AND SQUAWK.
WE'D HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.296
POOR MOM.
SHE'S SO OUT THERE.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.995
IT'S ALL THIS
STUFF WITH GEORGE.
IT REALLY DID A JOB ON HER.

42:23.100 --> 42:27.002
WELL, SHE COULD
STILL SHOW UP FOR
HER OWN SON'S COMA.

42:27.110 --> 42:28.634
( laughing )

42:34.580 --> 42:36.172
( groans )

42:39.020 --> 42:41.045
( sniffs, grunts )

42:41.150 --> 42:43.653
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO GO HOME AND TAKE
A SHOWER.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.819
Nate:
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.023
BUT THEN I'M GOING
TO COME RIGHT BACK.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.935
( kisses )

42:56.040 --> 42:59.305
OKAY. WILL YOU CALL ME
LATER, PLEASE?

42:59.410 --> 43:01.401
YEP.

43:01.510 --> 43:02.932
YOU, YOU REST.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.543
MMM.

43:05.650 --> 43:08.073
- GOOD-BYE, CHUCK.
- Chuck: GOOD-BYE.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.917
DAVE, YOU
SHOULD GO, TOO.

43:14.020 --> 43:16.284
MAYBE LATER.
I'LL KEEP YOU COMPANY
A LITTLE WHILE.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.828
YOU LOOK TIRED.

43:21.930 --> 43:24.558
IAM.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.365
WE'LL WATCH TV.

43:33.070 --> 43:36.608
- HEY, CHUCK, TURN
IT UP, WILL YOU?
- YEAH.

43:36.710 --> 43:40.999
(TV music increases )

43:59.870 --> 44:01.735
- ( car horn honking )
- David: NATE!

44:05.540 --> 44:07.030
David:
YO, NATE!

44:11.310 --> 44:13.403
( sighs )

44:13.510 --> 44:15.114
( soul music playing
on radio )

44:18.520 --> 44:22.354
* Hello, my love,
I heard a kiss from you... *

44:22.460 --> 44:26.123

44:27.590 --> 44:30.957
- WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.
- ( groans )

44:31.060 --> 44:34.120
JESUS, DAVID.
WATCH THE GRIP, MAN.

44:34.230 --> 44:35.788
LIGHTWEIGHT.

44:35.900 --> 44:38.733
* Rainbows and waterfalls
run through my mind *

44:39.840 --> 44:42.229
* In the garden,
I see *

44:42.340 --> 44:44.900
* West purple shower,
bells and tea *

44:45.010 --> 44:49.276
* Orange birds
and river cousins
dressed In green *

44:50.580 --> 44:52.810
* Pretty music I hear

44:52.920 --> 44:55.388
- * So happy and loud...
- WHERE'S YOUR SUIT?

44:55.490 --> 44:57.651
* Blue flowers echo
from a cherry cloud *

44:57.760 --> 45:00.786
I'M WEARING IT, DUDE.

45:00.890 --> 45:03.495
* Feel sunshine sparkle
pink and blue *

45:03.600 --> 45:05.227
* Playgrounds

45:05.330 --> 45:07.560
YOU STOKED?

45:07.670 --> 45:09.490

Is It cool? *

45:09.600 --> 45:11.636

45:24.790 --> 45:27.384
- * Over the sea...
- WHAT?

45:27.490 --> 45:29.355
I HAD THIS WHOLE
OTHER IDEA OF YOU.

45:29.460 --> 45:33.282
I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE THIS WHOLE
COMPLETELY OTHER PERSON.

45:33.390 --> 45:37.099
