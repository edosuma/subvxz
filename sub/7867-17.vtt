01:24.382 --> 01:26.409
- Did you unscrew the Phillips heads?
- Check.

01:26.534 --> 01:30.529
- Did you unscrew all the flat heads?
- Yep. And now we wait.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.800
Now, go hide the evidence
while I walk around saying:

01:55.142 --> 01:58.821
"What happened?
Who would do such a thing?"

01:58.946 --> 02:02.509
I'll return these to the shop room...
What's left of it.

02:09.731 --> 02:12.423
- Don't tell him I'm here.
- I know you're there, Skinner!

02:12.591 --> 02:15.509
I'd recognize those discolored
Hush Puppies anywhere.

02:16.021 --> 02:18.587
Hear that? He thinks
my Try'N'Save brand Shush Mutts

02:18.712 --> 02:20.283
are genuine Hush Puppies.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.434
We've got the "how,"
and we've got the "who,"

02:28.559 --> 02:29.982
but not the "why."

02:30.150 --> 02:32.026
Here it is.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.892
Hard to believe one lad
can cause all this mayhem.

02:37.017 --> 02:40.576
Particularly a lad who failed
"Introduction to Unscrewing."

02:42.412 --> 02:46.040
And I don't buy
this "lone prankster" theory.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.084
I think there was a second "funman."

02:49.402 --> 02:53.255
And if you don't identify him,
you're looking at a week's suspension.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.532
A nickel?

02:55.258 --> 02:58.093
You realize, if you're suspended,
you'll be missing...

02:58.394 --> 02:59.762
Taco Wednesday.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.162
Crunchy shell, ground beef,
lettuce,

03:04.287 --> 03:07.018
mild sauce, and of course,

03:07.143 --> 03:08.725
shredded cheddar cheese!

03:19.871 --> 03:21.575
I'll never tell.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.619
Then consider yourself suspended,
mister.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.997
Willie, take him to the big house...
where he lives.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.342
Let's go, lad.

03:30.556 --> 03:32.880
Suspended boy walking!

03:45.744 --> 03:47.268
Thanks for not selling me out.

03:47.534 --> 03:49.552
This really sucks, Bart.

03:49.677 --> 03:52.174
I'm grounded, and spend all day
listening to my dad

03:52.299 --> 03:54.608
 yell at "Mad Money"
with Jim Cramer.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.486
You said tech stocks
were bulletproof!

03:59.277 --> 04:00.583
Look, I gotta go.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.733
But don't worry,
I'll visit you every day. I promise. 

04:04.680 --> 04:07.288
Bart, you're a true friend.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.488
I'm glad they suspended Milhouse.

04:13.613 --> 04:15.574
He's a bad influence on you.

04:16.351 --> 04:20.208
You know, I think
Milhouse is El Barto.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.889
And now,
you're gonna visit your grampa

04:25.057 --> 04:27.349
while I park around the corner
and take a nap.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.819
So, Grampa,
not like I'm anxious to go,

04:38.987 --> 04:40.822
but I've been here 10 minutes,

04:40.947 --> 04:43.506
which is like 7 hours in kid years.

04:45.915 --> 04:49.580
It's her! The little girl
who doesn't recoil at the sight of us!

04:55.671 --> 04:56.690
Hi, guys.

04:57.388 --> 04:58.964
I brought cookies.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.462
Chocolate chip for Donald,
low sodium for Abe,

05:03.173 --> 05:05.248
not-made-by-immigrants for Sam

05:05.373 --> 05:07.932
and imaginary for Major Preston.

05:08.646 --> 05:12.061
With this cookie I can buy back
Private O'Malley from the Zulus.

05:12.736 --> 05:15.177
I think it is so cool
what you're doing.

05:15.302 --> 05:18.007
So, what's the gag?
You put ex-lax in the cookies,

05:18.132 --> 05:20.194
then just sit back
and watch the fireworks?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.869
- I would never do that.
- Oh, right.

05:22.994 --> 05:25.435
I was thinking of other things
that are hilarious.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.697
Like. Things that you think
are funny.

05:28.438 --> 05:29.909
Those are funny.

05:31.106 --> 05:32.546
- I'm Bart.
- I'm Jenny.

05:33.415 --> 05:36.199
She had more curves
than a Hot Wheels track.

05:36.324 --> 05:39.032
Well, she didn't yet,
but she would after puberty.

05:40.671 --> 05:42.565
Oh, my God.
How long was I zoned out?

05:42.690 --> 05:46.018
Bart, this is my Aunt Belle.
We dress alike. Isn't that cute?

05:47.764 --> 05:50.423
Math, done. Pine cone, collected.

05:50.548 --> 05:52.154
Permission slip, signed.

05:52.279 --> 05:56.090
Now, time for a break.
A little social studies.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.609
"What will Springfield be like
in 50 years?"

06:00.777 --> 06:02.767
Let's see what the computer says.

06:06.875 --> 06:09.540
That's horrible. What else?

06:12.664 --> 06:13.745
Oh, my God!

06:18.924 --> 06:21.422
It just gets worse and worse.

06:27.045 --> 06:29.564
So, who's the special someone?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.303
Jenny. Fifth grade girl.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.144
She gets to use the real scissors.
Nice.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.063
When she talks to me,
I feel like a better person.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.087
Powerful stuff.
You'd better claim her as your own.

06:41.212 --> 06:43.628
Punch her in her arm,
or if you're really serious,

06:43.753 --> 06:45.237
stick gum in her hair.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.248
Here, I always come prepared.

06:48.716 --> 06:50.617
Take two.
You might get lucky.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.447
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hi, Bart.

07:00.184 --> 07:03.756
Boy, you make it look effortless.
And that kid's giving you zero pump.

07:04.517 --> 07:06.498
You know what a girl likes to hear.

07:07.569 --> 07:10.248
Seal the deal!
Punch her! Punch her!

07:11.958 --> 07:13.512
Punch her!

07:16.604 --> 07:20.188
Do you want to go on a picnic tomorrow?
You'd love my PB and J.

07:20.313 --> 07:22.775
The secret is, no PB, double J.

07:23.622 --> 07:24.624
It's a date.

07:28.378 --> 07:31.067
- Willie, I've got a girlfriend!
- Really?

07:31.192 --> 07:33.452
Well, I do, too!

07:33.620 --> 07:37.122
She's... a bikini model from Sweden.

07:38.252 --> 07:39.338
That's great.

07:43.372 --> 07:45.852
Willie, darling, come back to bed.

07:45.977 --> 07:49.635
- Don't you love me?
- Don't compete with my job, Inga.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.968
You'll never win.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.989
And now, Ralph Wiggum
will read his essay

07:57.114 --> 07:59.186
 on "Springfield in 50 Years."

08:00.053 --> 08:03.426
"In 50 years,
the vacuum cleaner will be quiet

08:03.551 --> 08:04.780
and not scary."

08:06.361 --> 08:08.862
Next, we have Lisa Simpson.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.504
Ralph, how I envy your optimism!

08:14.629 --> 08:17.395
There is no Springfield,
50 years in the future!

08:17.520 --> 08:21.511
With global warming trapping the CO2
inside our poisonous atmosphere,

08:21.636 --> 08:25.291
our super-heated oceans will rise,
drowning our lowlands,

08:25.416 --> 08:27.395
leaving what's left of humanity

08:27.520 --> 08:30.688
baking in deserts
that once fed the world!

08:32.212 --> 08:36.097
And in the new Nineveh,
darkness falls.

08:42.938 --> 08:46.441
Lisa, your outburst was either a sign
of deep emotional imbalance,

08:46.609 --> 08:49.069
or a passionate response
to a sobering truth.

08:49.376 --> 08:51.738
Luckily, the treatment for both
is intensive therapy.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.075
What's therapy going to do for me
when the world is in ashes?

08:55.399 --> 08:57.010
I don't know.
But when you go,

08:57.135 --> 08:59.048
could you return
this Sports Illustrated for me?

08:59.173 --> 09:01.582
Someone must have...
put it in my bag.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.751
They do that, you know.
They're always putting things in my bag!

09:06.918 --> 09:08.338
So, you visit old folks,

09:08.506 --> 09:10.924
How else do you make the world
a better place?

09:14.973 --> 09:18.977
I spend a lot of time
working with a mentally-challenged guy.

09:19.102 --> 09:20.434
Wait, here he is now!

09:20.602 --> 09:22.544
- Lookin' good, Homer!
- Boy.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.738
- He seems pretty high-functioning.
- Just wait.

09:28.248 --> 09:29.873
Don't shake your fist at me!

09:30.542 --> 09:31.987
I don't want any trouble.

09:32.366 --> 09:34.926
Come on. Here, just take my wallet.
Leave me alone, okay?

09:39.487 --> 09:41.914
Do you know who else
was really into rowboats? Jesus.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.332
And he could've turned his rowboat
into a jet ski,

09:44.457 --> 09:46.168
but he didn't. Good guy.

09:47.112 --> 09:48.921
Cheese and crackers! Look!

09:51.562 --> 09:54.775
You want your duckling back?
Here it is.

09:55.018 --> 09:56.101
Psych!

09:57.941 --> 10:01.183
That'll teach you to match wits with us,
you stupid mother duck!

10:01.533 --> 10:03.357
Bart, can't you do something?

10:08.526 --> 10:11.250
Those bullies are gonna kill me!
Why am I doing this?

10:18.116 --> 10:19.409
Please, give me a break.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.536
Give me the duckling
without beating me up.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.039
Well, we'll have to beat you up
a little.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.166
Come on.
I'm trying to impress a girl.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.405
So are we.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.964
Either the duck suffers
or the kid does.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.783
Or none of you's getting nothing
from Shauna.

10:34.005 --> 10:35.243
I'm Shauna.

10:42.084 --> 10:45.618
Bart, if those ducklings
understood how magnificent you were,

10:45.743 --> 10:47.485
they'd stop biting your leg.

10:53.121 --> 10:57.114
We believe Lisa is suffering
from Environment Related Despair.

10:58.850 --> 11:01.368
It's even worse
when you know it has a name.

11:01.536 --> 11:05.278
Now don't worry, she'll be fine
after years of expensive treatment.

11:05.403 --> 11:08.250
And, we have a new drug
to combat this syndrome:

11:08.418 --> 11:09.710
Ignorital.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.878
Let me show you how Ignorital works.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.256
It turns this... to this.

11:16.165 --> 11:19.332
Lisa's a little young
to be taking "happy pills."

11:19.457 --> 11:22.364
Marge, we came to an appointment
in the middle of the day!

11:22.489 --> 11:24.516
That's the most a parent can do.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.352
- We done here?
- Go ahead... numb me.

11:30.925 --> 11:32.781
Mom, can I get those dishes
for you? 

11:35.110 --> 11:37.604
- What's your angle, mister?
- No angle.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.809
If this girl I'm seeing
comes here, and she might,

11:40.934 --> 11:43.545
I wouldn't mind if you told her
I was the kind of boy

11:43.670 --> 11:44.870
that does the dishes.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.315
Yeah, busboys get all the chicks.

11:49.826 --> 11:51.293
Well, off to school

11:51.461 --> 11:55.041
where they'll prepare our little minds
for a future we'll never see.

11:55.166 --> 11:58.083
Sounds like someone's got
a case of the Mondays.

12:05.006 --> 12:07.001
I'm going to Dizzyland.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.005
So, this is setting the table!

12:37.173 --> 12:39.667
If I'd known how easy this was,
I'd have just done it, 

12:39.792 --> 12:41.648
instead of throwing
all those tantrums.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.382
Bart, I don't care
that this is just an act.

12:44.507 --> 12:47.749
You've finally become the boy
every mother dreams of.

12:47.874 --> 12:49.014
A girl.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.236
You never told me
that the "special" man

13:01.361 --> 13:03.231
you were working with
is your father.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.450
It's not an easy thing to admit.

13:12.946 --> 13:16.352
Is the rest of your family... okay?

13:17.450 --> 13:18.463
Well...

13:18.631 --> 13:20.549
Hello, Smiley Face.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.522
Hello, Smiley Face!

13:26.812 --> 13:27.931
Officer down.

13:29.152 --> 13:32.351
Jenny, it's amazing
what you've done with my son.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.729
Well, I think Bart
is an incredible combination

13:36.854 --> 13:39.576
of Habitat For Humanity
and the Jonas Brothers.

13:40.306 --> 13:43.084
And nothing can ever change
my opinion about him.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.977
We don't have any money!
Go away!

13:50.274 --> 13:52.851
May I de-corn your cob, my darling?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.382
Why didn't you come
to visit me, Bart?

14:02.550 --> 14:05.739
Yeah, I meant to,
I've just been so busy.

14:05.864 --> 14:08.138
My schedule has been
all like... "Rooo!"

14:08.306 --> 14:10.974
But what could be more important
than your best friend?

14:11.652 --> 14:12.906
Who's this, Bart?

14:15.279 --> 14:17.246
I see how it is.

14:18.229 --> 14:21.037
Actually, I don't.
My glasses are fogged.

14:25.936 --> 14:29.100
I learned some great new swear words
from my uncle.

14:29.225 --> 14:32.246
He's got a broken back,
so he's in constant pain.

14:32.902 --> 14:36.041
Bart?
Would you be interested in swears?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.335
Yes, because only by knowing them

14:38.460 --> 14:40.962
can you prevent bad little kids
from saying them.

14:42.686 --> 14:43.744
What do you want?

14:43.869 --> 14:47.385
I want to know why my best friend
didn't visit me like he said he would.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.940
Milhouse, real best friends
often don't speak for years at a time.

14:51.065 --> 14:53.058
Like John Adams
and Thomas Jefferson.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.741
Just because you saw one episode
of one mini-series

14:56.866 --> 14:59.147
doesn't mean you get to use it
as a whip.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.722
Look, man,
I have to keep my dark past hidden.

15:01.847 --> 15:03.917
There's someone new in my life, now.

15:10.556 --> 15:12.839
I get it. It's love.

15:12.964 --> 15:16.540
- I guess you found your Abigail Adams.
- My who?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.271
So I'll be on my way.

15:18.396 --> 15:20.373
I can see I'm the fifth wheel

15:20.498 --> 15:22.511
on this bicycle
with training wheels.

15:22.636 --> 15:24.718
But the next time I see you two,

15:24.843 --> 15:27.679
I might not be able
to hold my tongue.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.768
It's really quite difficult.

15:37.179 --> 15:39.288
Reverend, care for some
of my devils food cake?

15:39.413 --> 15:41.429
Is that really devils food?

15:41.554 --> 15:44.176
No, it's angel food
with chocolate on top.

15:44.683 --> 15:45.527
I knew it.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.237
Sorry I'm late.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.755
I didn't realize you had to turn
the oven on to bake stuff.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.026
So, Jenny, I hear you're religious.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.494
Know what my favorite book
of the Bible is?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.580
Revelations.

15:56.748 --> 15:57.847
Mine, too.

15:57.972 --> 16:01.251
Bart, we should take Milhouse
on our trip to juice country.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.324
Are you nuts?
Milhouse will spill everything.

16:04.449 --> 16:06.423
By which I mean juice, not secrets. 

16:06.591 --> 16:08.468
Yeah, you guys don't want me there.

16:09.652 --> 16:13.098
But I'm sure
we'll see each other soon.

16:27.703 --> 16:30.477
Bart, you look tense.
Have a cookie.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.466
If you don't stop smiling,

16:55.591 --> 16:57.766
you're gonna get a kiss.

17:01.624 --> 17:04.643
That's it!
We're getting you off the meds.

17:15.992 --> 17:19.329
We should be safe from Milhouse, here.
Being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.579
Milhouse is funny.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.751
The way he's always shaking me
by the shoulders

17:22.876 --> 17:24.797
and saying:
"I don't know the real you."

17:25.460 --> 17:26.252
Funny.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.088
I'm tired of talking about Milhouse.

17:29.213 --> 17:30.423
Hello, Bart.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.093
Surprised to see me at sea level?

17:33.261 --> 17:36.346
You can't bleed out your nose
when your heart's broken.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.599
Milhouse, could you stop being creepy
for just a minute?

17:40.935 --> 17:43.378
Jenny, do you see
how the dolphin in that tank

17:43.503 --> 17:45.605
seems to shy away from Bart?

17:46.305 --> 17:52.769
