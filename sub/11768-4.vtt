01:19.400 --> 01:21.067

DON'T SEEM TO MIND IT.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.300

01:25.467 --> 01:27.800
OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO TIRED.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.567
THERE WAS THAT THREE HOUR
DIFFERENCE AND...

01:29.600 --> 01:31.933
YOU SHOULD GO UP
AND TAKE A NAP.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.267
UH, I'M TOO WOUND UP
RIGHT NOW.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.067
YOU KNOW LITTLE GRIFFIN,
MY YOUNGEST NEPHEW ?

01:37.100 --> 01:39.400

01:39.433 --> 01:41.500
UH, AND HE WANTED TO
PLAY ON THE STAIRS

01:41.533 --> 01:43.367
AND MY SISTER'S LIKE,
"NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS."

01:43.400 --> 01:44.767
MY MOM SAYS,
"OH, I'VE RAISED FOUR KIDS."

01:44.800 --> 01:45.767
I--

01:45.800 --> 01:48.167
UH-HUH.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.567
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WATCH YOUR GAME ?

01:50.600 --> 01:53.067
COME ON, IT'S THE LAST
TWO MINUTES.

01:53.067 --> 01:55.600
I'LL BE RIGHT UP, OKAY ?

01:55.633 --> 01:59.733
( announcer )
Man, they shoot themselves
in the foot every single time

01:59.767 --> 02:01.100
they get in this position.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.067
SO, SOMEBODY
TOLD ME TODAY

02:09.067 --> 02:12.067
THAT TOO MUCH SOY
MAKES YOUR BRAIN SHRINK.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.733
KIND OF SCARED ME
A LITTLE BIT.

02:15.767 --> 02:18.700
I'VE BEEN HAVING SOY FOR
BREAKFAST WITH MY CEREAL

02:18.733 --> 02:20.600
EVERYDAY FOR
THE LAST 10 YEARS.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.300
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
SWITCH TO MILK NOW ?

02:25.333 --> 02:27.100
I DON'T KNOW IF COULD
SWITCH TO MILK.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.867
YOU KNOW, CHOLESTEROL.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.200
CAN'T WIN, REALLY.

02:40.133 --> 02:42.133
SO, SO TELL ME
ABOUT THE TRIP.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.400
WHAT, UM...

02:44.433 --> 02:47.367
HOW'S YOUR COUSIN,
GRIFFIN ?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
GRIFFIN IS MY NEPHEW.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.600
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER
AND EVERYTHING ?

02:56.633 --> 02:58.367
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

02:59.700 --> 03:04.567
SHE'S SARCASTIC WONDERFUL
OR JUST...

03:04.600 --> 03:07.100
DOES THAT MEAN
SHE'S NOT WONDERFUL OR...

03:07.133 --> 03:10.267
NO, SHE REALLY
IS WONDERFUL.

03:15.067 --> 03:19.067
WELL, I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED DOWNSTAIRS

03:19.100 --> 03:22.533
WHEN YOU GOT HOME.

03:22.567 --> 03:23.733
I WAS WATCHING THE GAME

03:23.767 --> 03:26.767
AND IT'S LIKE THE LAST
TWO MINUTES, YOU KNOW.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.400
THAT'S FINE.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.133
DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE IT'S FINE.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.267
BUT, YOU KNOW...

03:36.300 --> 03:38.367
I'M SENSING RANCOR.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.867
OR IS IT "RANKER" ?

03:39.900 --> 03:41.900
RANCOR ?

03:41.933 --> 03:42.900
I KNOW HOW TO SPELL IT.

03:42.933 --> 03:46.500
LARRY, PLEASE,
IT'S FINE.

03:46.533 --> 03:48.900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT ME TO SAY RIGHT NOW.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.300
WELL, HOW ABOUT...

03:53.333 --> 03:54.533
"HONEY, I FORGIVE YOU.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.067
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE SEX ?"

03:56.067 --> 03:57.800
HOW ABOUT THAT ?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.800
OR ANY COMBINATION
OF THAT.

03:59.833 --> 04:00.867
MM-HMM.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.633
EITHER FORGIVENESS
OR THE SEX.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.100
OF COURSE,
BOTH WOULD BE GREAT.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.467
THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.633
I'M NOT
EXPECTING BOTH.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.133
HEY, IF YOU WERE WATCHING
THE OSCARS OR SOMETHING, OKAY,

04:13.167 --> 04:17.467
AND THEY WERE ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE
THE BEST ACTRESS CATEGORY

04:17.500 --> 04:20.667
AND I CAME HOME,
I WOULD SAY,

04:20.700 --> 04:22.867
"NO, SIT DOWN,
FINISH WATCHING IT."

04:22.900 --> 04:26.067
I THINK IF YOU HAD
BEEN GONE ON A TRIP,

04:26.067 --> 04:28.800
I COULD MAKE
TWO MINUTES FOR YOU

04:28.833 --> 04:31.633
TO LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED
AND SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.867
IF IT WAS IN
THE THIRD QUARTER,

04:33.900 --> 04:36.733
EASILY, I'D GIVE YOU
15 MINUTES.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.233
BUT WE'RE IN THE LAST
TWO MINUTES OF THE GAME.

04:39.267 --> 04:41.500
THEY'VE GOT THE BALL
ON THE 35 YARD LINE.

04:43.467 --> 04:46.700
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE MOMENT IS PASSED.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.367
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.967
( female )
HOW MANY FREQUENT FLIER MILES
DO I NEED ?

04:59.067 --> 05:00.867
OKAY, I'M GONNA
CALL YOU BACK.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.667
HI.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.900
PHIL SCHEFF CALLED.

05:04.933 --> 05:07.933
HE SAID YOU CAN CALL HIM
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

05:07.967 --> 05:09.567
WHAT ARE
YOU WEARING ?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.300
I'M GONNA
WORK OUT LATER.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.067
YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.667
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OUTFIT
I GOT YOU LAST WEEK ?

05:15.700 --> 05:17.833
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE IN IT,
IT'S TOO NEW.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.733
HEY, WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.500
YOU HAVEN'T SHAVED.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.800
ALRIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

05:24.833 --> 05:25.867
NOTHING.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.100
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
SOMETHING'S UP WITH YOU.

05:28.133 --> 05:30.900
CHERYL'S NOT TALKING
TO ME, THAT'S ALL.

05:30.933 --> 05:33.400
ALRIGHT,
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

05:33.433 --> 05:36.400
WELL, I WAS WATCHING THE GAME,
THE FOOTBALL GAME,

05:36.433 --> 05:37.733
AND SHE'D BEEN AWAY
FOR FOUR DAYS

05:37.767 --> 05:41.667
AND SHE COMES HOME
WITH TWO MINUTES
LEFT TO GO IN THE GAME

05:41.700 --> 05:44.933
AND MY ATTENTION
WAS DIVERTED AND, UH...

05:44.967 --> 05:48.200
OH, LARRY, LARRY, LARRY.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.433
YOU GOTTA
GET HER A GIFT.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.800
YOU CAN'T COME HOME
EMPTY HANDED.

05:51.833 --> 05:52.800
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

05:52.833 --> 05:53.833
YEAH.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.900
WE WERE AT THIS JEWELRY STORE
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

05:57.933 --> 06:01.467
23rd STREET JEWELERS AND SHE WAS
LOOKING AT THIS BRACELET

06:01.500 --> 06:03.967
AND IT WAS PLATINUM, IT HAD,
LIKE, LITTLE DIAMONDS IN IT.

06:04.067 --> 06:07.167
OOH, OH, YEAH,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.200
YEAH, IS THAT IT ?

06:08.233 --> 06:10.100

I WAS AFRAID OF.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.733
HEY, HEY !

06:32.567 --> 06:33.833
HEY, THANKS A LOT

06:33.867 --> 06:35.133
THAT WAS
HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.300
YEAH, OH,

06:36.333 --> 06:37.533

06:47.200 --> 06:48.533
OKAY, TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.400
OKAY.

06:51.733 --> 06:52.700
NO.

06:52.733 --> 06:55.600
I WASN'T

06:55.633 --> 06:57.533
I'M NOT WITH HIM !

06:57.567 --> 07:00.300

07:11.333 --> 07:13.633
EXCUSE ME, SIR,

07:13.667 --> 07:14.700
I'M GONNA
DIAL A NUMBER.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.067

JUST HANG UP,

07:17.067 --> 07:20.467
AND IF A MAN ANSWERS,
HAND IT BACK TO ME, OKAY ?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.167
ARE YOU PUTTING ME ON ?

07:22.200 --> 07:23.767

07:23.800 --> 07:25.067
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT,
WHAT ARE YOU--

07:25.067 --> 07:26.067
I HATE MY FRIEND'S
GIRLFRIEND.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.467
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO HER.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.233
PLEASE, THANK YOU.

07:32.567 --> 07:33.533

LOOK AT YOU.

07:51.467 --> 07:52.500

07:52.533 --> 07:54.300

08:03.600 --> 08:04.900
I JUST WANT YOU

08:04.933 --> 08:07.167
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
FOR ME TO THANK YOU FOR.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.967
GOOD POINT, GOOD.

08:09.067 --> 08:11.467
SO, THE BRACELET IS
RIGHT IN THE FRONT.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.100
IT'S PLATINUM,
IT'S GOT LITTLE DIAMONDS.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.333
IS THERE A NAME LIKE
"PLUTO'S TAIL" OR ANYTHING ?

08:14.367 --> 08:16.533
I DON'T KNOW
THE NAME OF IT.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.167
IT'S RIGHT IN
THE FRONT CENTER.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.167
OF WHAT ?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.433

VELVET NECK THINGS ?

08:23.167 --> 08:24.500

08:25.933 --> 08:28.567
IT'S A BRACELET, A BRACELET,
IT'S NOT ON A HAND.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.567
IT'S A BRACELET.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
IT'S NOT ON A THING ?

08:30.633 --> 08:32.500
THERE'S ONLY
TWO BRACELETS IN THE--

08:32.533 --> 08:35.067
IT HAS TO EITHER BE ON
A HAND OR ON A MANNEQUIN.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.400
WHY'D I EVER
CALL THIS GUY ?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.333

IT'S ABOUT 25 MINUTES,
A HALF HOUR IT'LL TAKE US.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.133
SO WHAT ?

09:18.167 --> 09:19.400
COME ON, LIKE WE'RE
IN NEW YORK AGAIN,

09:19.433 --> 09:20.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

09:20.433 --> 09:21.700
I NEVER WALKED
IN NEW YORK.

09:21.733 --> 09:23.067
BRISKLY, IT'S ONLY
ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.067
I NEED IT FOR
MY CARDIOVASCULAR.

09:25.067 --> 09:28.267
I TOLD YOU, 25 RELATIVES
HAD HEART ATTACKS IN MY FAMILY.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.333
DO ME ONE,
LET ME WALK.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.233
OKAY, PLEASE.

09:31.267 --> 09:32.367
I'M NOT LYING.

09:39.567 --> 09:40.800
WHY DO YOU THINK ?

09:40.833 --> 09:42.467
WE'RE MEN
AND MEN NEED IT MORE.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.933
NO, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THAT.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.533
I GOT IT.

09:45.567 --> 09:46.533
WHY ?

09:46.567 --> 09:48.167
I GOT IT, IT'S FINE.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.933
NO, IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE
SO OFFENDED BY OUR GENITALIA...

09:54.333 --> 09:57.967
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE
IN LOVE WITH US TO HAVE IT.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.833
THAT'S WHY WE CAN HAVE SEX
WITH ANYONE AND THEY CAN'T.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.600
OH, BECAUSE PENISES DON'T LOOK
AS ATTRACTIVE AND THAT'S WHY...

10:03.633 --> 10:05.633
YES, THEY CAN'T JUST
HAVE SEX WITH ANY MAN.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.500
THEY HAVE TO
REALLY LOVE THE MAN

10:07.533 --> 10:09.633
TO GET INVOLVED
WITH THEIR PENIS,

10:09.667 --> 10:12.733
WITH THEIR
GROTESQUE PENIS.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.400
I'M MISSING SOMETHING.

10:14.433 --> 10:17.333
NO, I THINK
IT'S A GOOD THEORY.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.633
IT'S A DISGUSTING THEORY
AT LUNCH,

10:18.667 --> 10:19.767
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.733
WE'RE ALREADY FINISHED
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:24.433 --> 10:25.567
THANKS FOR LUNCH,
BY THE WAY.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.800
YOU'RE WELCOME,
WHAT IS THIS ?

10:27.833 --> 10:29.167
WHAT ?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.767
THERE'S A SPACE HERE
TO TIP A CAPTAIN ?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.100
A CAPTAIN ?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.700
INSTEAD OF A WAITER ?

10:34.733 --> 10:36.567
NO, BOTH.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.067
LOOK AT THIS.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.233
THERE'S A SPACE FOR A CAPTAIN
AND A SPACE FOR A WAITER.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.333
SO, YOU GIVE BOTH.

10:43.367 --> 10:44.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I GIVE BOTH ?

10:44.567 --> 10:45.933
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO GIVE ?

10:45.967 --> 10:47.033
YOU GIVE THE WAITER
WHAT YOU WANT

10:47.067 --> 10:48.567
AND THE CAPTAIN HALF.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.700
HALF OF THE WAITER'S ?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.833
HALF OF MY 20 PERCENT
ALLOTMENT TO THE WAITER ?

10:51.867 --> 10:52.967
ALLOTMENT ?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.333
WELL, I HAVE 20 PERCENT
ALLOTTED TO THE WAITER.

10:55.367 --> 10:56.767
SOUND LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE SCHEMATA BUSINESS.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.400
THE CAPTAIN'S GONNA BE
HORNING IN NOW ON MY ALLOTMENT ?

11:01.433 --> 11:02.667
ON WHAT THE WAITER'S
GETTING ?

11:02.700 --> 11:05.067
NO, NO,
THE WAITER WAS GOOD.

11:05.067 --> 11:07.567
SO, IT'S 30 PERCENT,
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.700
20 AND 10.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.233
20 AND 10 ?

11:10.267 --> 11:11.733
YOU SEE A CAPTAIN,
WHAT DOES HE DO ?

11:11.767 --> 11:14.167
I THINK I SAW, THE GUY
AT THE PODIUM, HE POINTED.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.333
I THINK THE CAPTAIN'S HORNING
IN ON THE WAITER, FRANKLY,

11:16.367 --> 11:18.067
'CAUSE MOST PEOPLE
ARE PROBABLY

11:18.067 --> 11:19.833
REDUCING THE TIP
TO THE WAITER.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.300
YOU THINK
HE'S HORNING ?

11:21.333 --> 11:23.100
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.567
WHO IS THIS CAPTAIN
OUT OF THE CLEAR BLUE SKY ?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.067
YOU'RE GONNA NOT
LEAVE ANYTHING FOR THE-- ?

11:27.067 --> 11:28.567
I'M GIVING THE WAITER
30 PERCENT.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.667
LET THE WAITER GIVE THE CAPTAIN
10 PERCENT IF HE WANTS.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.100
I'LL GIVE
THE WAITER THE MONEY.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.967
LET'S GO, THANKS FOR LUNCH,
BY THE WAY.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.533
AND THANKS FOR
THE PENIS TALK.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.067
NEXT TIME, THERE'LL BE
A SPACE FOR A LIEUTENANT,

11:42.100 --> 11:44.067
THEN MAYBE A COLONEL,
TIP THE COLONEL,

11:44.067 --> 11:45.400
HOW MUCH, COLONEL ?

11:45.433 --> 11:46.400
WHAT DOES
THE COLONEL GET ?

11:46.433 --> 11:47.867
I BET IN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

11:47.900 --> 11:52.400
YOU DIDN'T PUT THE LITTLE PENNY
IN THE UNICEF SLOTS, RIGHT ?

11:52.433 --> 11:53.500
IT'S UNLIKELY.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.800
HELLO, EXCUSE ME ?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.267
HI, HI.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY STOPPED.

11:58.700 --> 12:01.100
I'VE BEEN STANDING OUT HERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

12:01.133 --> 12:04.167
AND YOU'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE
THAT HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.067
ANYWAY, I HATE
TO IMPOSE ON YOU.

12:07.067 --> 12:10.400
I WONDER IF I COULD JUST TAKE UP
A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR TIME.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.600
I NEED A LITTLE HELP.

12:12.633 --> 12:14.967
WHAT DO YOU NEED ?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.400
UH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.667
I JUST MOVED INTO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

12:18.700 --> 12:22.733
AND I HAVE THESE BOXES IN
THE MIDDLE OF MY LIVING ROOM

12:22.767 --> 12:26.800
AND I ACTUALLY JUST NEED
A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME

12:26.833 --> 12:28.767
TO HELP ME MOVE THEM
TO THE CORNER

12:28.800 --> 12:30.700
SO, I DON'T
TRIP OVER THEM.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.800
I DON'T SEE.

12:32.833 --> 12:35.333
WHERE DO YOU LIVE ?

12:35.367 --> 12:37.467
AROUND THE CORNER,
JUST RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.967
IT WOULD HELP ME SO MUCH
IF YOU COULD JUST HELP ME.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.833
I KINDA GOTTA
GET TO THE JEWELRY STORE.

12:42.867 --> 12:44.400
YES, I KNOW,
IT'S A TERRIBLE IMPOSITION.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.233
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

12:46.267 --> 12:49.133
HOW CAN YOU NOT
HELP A BLIND MAN ?

12:49.167 --> 12:51.867
HOW COULD YOU SAY "BLIND MAN"
IN FRONT OF A BLIND MAN ?

12:51.900 --> 12:53.933
OH, PLEASE, NO.

12:53.967 --> 12:56.333
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
IN A BAD WAY.

12:56.367 --> 12:57.833
I MEANT SIGHTLESS.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.067
I DIDN'T MEAN...

12:59.100 --> 13:01.067
I RESPECT THE BLIND
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.767
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM,
BELIEVE ME.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.633
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
IN A DEROGATORY SENSE

13:04.667 --> 13:06.067
I GOT
MY OWN PROBLEMS.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.333
AND I'M
A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.733
I HAVE INTIMACY PROBLEMS.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.600
POOR GUY, TERRIBLE
INTIMACY PROBLEMS.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.133
CAN'T GET CLOSE TO A WOMAN,
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

13:14.167 --> 13:15.967
IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.767
WE'RE ALL THE SAME,
WE'RE ALL THE SAME.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.567
HE CAN'T SEE AND YOU HAVE
INTIMACY PROBLEMS.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.900
YOU GUYS HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

13:22.933 --> 13:26.200
YOUR PROBLEMS

MY FINGERS ONCE, WILL YA ?

14:14.200 --> 14:15.200
GREAT.

14:15.233 --> 14:18.367
JUST THROW A LITTLE CHAIR
AND I'M GOOD.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.833
YEAH, OOH,
THE ANCAPATHA, SORRY.

14:21.867 --> 14:24.267
THIS IS VERY HEAVY.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.633
MEMBER OF
THE LILY FAMILY.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.167
PUSH IT, PUSH IT !

14:27.200 --> 14:29.067

THERE'S NOTHING ELSE,

14:42.600 --> 14:45.733
WHERE DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD PUT THE TV ?

14:45.767 --> 14:47.067

15:57.500 --> 15:59.833
UH-HUH.

15:59.867 --> 16:03.767

OF THE FIREPLACE.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.467
WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY DID
WE MOVE IT IN THE BEDROOM THEN ?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.600
WHY IS IT
IN THE BEDROOM ?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.500
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE MOVED IT
IN THE BEDROOM, I--

16:09.533 --> 16:10.533
YOU TOLD US TO MOVE IT
IN THE BEDROOM.

16:10.567 --> 16:11.767
NO, I DID NOT !

16:11.800 --> 16:13.400
RICHARD SAID
BRING IT IN THE BEDROOM.

16:13.433 --> 16:16.267
ANYWAY, YOU DON'T EVEN WANT IT,
WHY DO YOU WANT IT OVER HERE ?

16:16.300 --> 16:17.267
FOR MY GUESTS !

16:17.300 --> 16:18.267
IT DOESN'T WORK
OVER HERE.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.800
YOU COULD RUIN THE WHOLE
HEARTH AFFECT.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.067
I THINK YOU SAID
THE BEDROOM.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.167
WHAT IN
THE NAME OF GOD

16:22.200 --> 16:23.500
AM I GONNA DO

16:23.533 --> 16:25.067
I'M BLIND,
FOR CHRISSAKES.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.067
BUT IT DOESN'T
WORK IN HERE !

16:26.067 --> 16:27.067
IT JUST DOESN'T,
DOESN'T FIT !

16:27.100 --> 16:28.633
THAT'S WHERE
IT BELONGS !

16:28.667 --> 16:32.133
ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY SENSE OF SPACE, LARRY ?

16:32.167 --> 16:33.967
I'M NOT QUESTIONING
YOUR SENSE OF SPACE, BUT--

16:34.067 --> 16:37.267
THANK YOU, BRING IN THE GODDAMN
TV AND BE DONE WITH IT !

16:37.300 --> 16:39.133

THANK YOU, RICHARD.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.167

16:45.533 --> 16:46.500

RICHARD !

16:46.533 --> 16:47.867
I'M SORRY.

16:52.433 --> 16:56.067
LOOK, WE DID A GOOD THING,
BUT I, WHO KNEW ?

16:56.067 --> 16:57.767
THE BLIND MAN
MISLED US THOUGH.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.967
IT'S TRUE, BUT--

16:59.067 --> 17:00.267
HE DID MISLEAD US.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.567
HE DIDN'T TELL US THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT WE HAD TO MOVE.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.400
HE WAS
A DECEPTIVE BLIND MAN.

17:04.433 --> 17:07.100
I THINK IF YOUR BLIND,
YOU HAVE SOME, UH...

17:07.133 --> 17:09.067
YOU GOT LICENSE,
YOU GOT BLIND LICENSE ?

17:09.067 --> 17:11.100
I CAN FINISH
MY OWN THOUGHT.

17:11.133 --> 17:12.600
YOU WEREN'T DOING
A VERY GOOD JOB OF IT.

17:12.633 --> 17:13.833
I'M EXHAUSTED.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.533
( laughing )

17:22.933 --> 17:23.900
YOU LIKE THAT ?

17:23.933 --> 17:24.900
SHIT HAPPENS.

17:24.933 --> 17:26.567
OH, SHIT HAPPENS.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.067
THAT'S GREAT.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.367
LET ME SEE THIS THING

17:29.400 --> 17:32.367

LIFETIME TRYING TO GET.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.400
SEE IN THE FRONT,
IN THE CENTER.

17:35.433 --> 17:36.767

RAMP THING ?

17:36.800 --> 17:37.933
YEAH, YEAH.

17:37.967 --> 17:38.933
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.067
I KNOW, IT'S NICE.

17:41.067 --> 17:43.433
WAVE GOODBYE.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.667
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.067
YEAH.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.100
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA
TELL YOU THIS.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.433
YOU HELPED
A BLIND MAN.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.433
AND, YOU KNOW, TO ME,
THIS WAS A GREAT DAY.

17:51.467 --> 17:52.500
IT WAS ?

17:52.533 --> 17:53.833
YEAH.

17:53.867 --> 17:56.067
EVERYDAY'S
A GREAT DAY FOR ME.

17:56.067 --> 17:59.567
LOOK AT YOU, NORMAN VINCENT,
NORMAN VINCENT LEWIS.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.100
NO, I'M NOT
NORMAN VINCENT LEWIS.

18:01.133 --> 18:02.400
ARE YOU
NORMAN VINCENT LEWIS ?

18:02.433 --> 18:05.733
IS IT TRUE OR NOT THAT
I HAVE MORE, I DON'T KNOW,

18:05.767 --> 18:07.067
SERENITY THAN YOU ?

18:07.100 --> 18:09.900
YOU SEEM NEVER,
YOU HAVE NO GRATITUDE.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.533
YOU HAVE MORE SERENITY ?

18:11.567 --> 18:13.967
IN MY OWN WAY I DO.

18:14.067 --> 18:16.067
I AM IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE
IF THAT'S THE CASE.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.267
I MEAN,
I LOVE YOU.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.233
YOU ARE JUST A BABBLING
BROOK OF BULLSHIT.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.433
I'LL SEE YOU.

18:23.467 --> 18:24.433
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

18:24.467 --> 18:25.533
YEAH.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.900
YEAH, YEAH,
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

18:31.933 --> 18:33.400
BUT I GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING, RICHIE BOY,

18:33.433 --> 18:35.133
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.367
IF THEY PUNT, THE WAY
THE GIANTS DEFENSE IS PLAYING,

18:37.400 --> 18:40.567
THEY WON'T GET
THE BALL BACK.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.167
HEY, LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.500
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO
PICK UP MY CREDIT CARD

18:43.533 --> 18:45.467
AT LUNCH TODAY,
DID YOU ?

18:45.500 --> 18:48.333
I DON'T KNOW, I MUST HAVE LEFT
IT ON THE TABLE OR SOMETHING.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.067
GREAT, WE'RE ALL MADE UP.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.067
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.567
GOT HER SOME ROSES.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.633
BOY, IT'S AMAZING
HOW THESE ROSES WORK.

18:58.667 --> 18:59.867
YEAH.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.967
YOU WANT TO
BUY THE BRACELET ?

19:07.267 --> 19:09.300
IS IT HER BIRTHDAY ?

19:13.900 --> 19:17.800
WELL, YEAH,
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.067
THEY'RE RUNNING,
OH, WHAT IDIOTS !

19:23.067 --> 19:24.633
DO YOU BELIEVE
THIS TEAM ?

19:26.067 --> 19:30.233
OH, I GOTTA GO,
CHERYL'S HOME.

19:30.267 --> 19:31.867
HI !

19:31.900 --> 19:32.867
HEY !

19:32.900 --> 19:33.867
HOW ARE YA,
HONEY ?

19:33.900 --> 19:34.867
HI.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.367
OH, OH...

19:39.567 --> 19:40.533
OKAY.

19:40.567 --> 19:43.167
HOW'S IT GOING ?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.467
OH, IT'S FOOTBALL AGAIN.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.900
IS THERE A GAME ON ?

19:46.933 --> 19:47.900
YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT ?

19:47.933 --> 19:49.300
RIGHT NOW,
ON THE TV ?

19:49.333 --> 19:50.500
YOU'RE KIDDING ?

19:50.533 --> 19:52.067
WOW.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.800
HOW WAS
YOUR NRDC MEETING ?

19:53.833 --> 19:54.967
OH, IT WAS GREAT.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.200
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG
BEACH CLEANING DAY.

19:57.233 --> 19:58.200
BEACH CLEANING DAY ?

19:58.233 --> 20:00.833
YEAH, LIKE THOUSANDS
OF VOLUNTEERS.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.067
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE BOOTHS
ALL UP AND DOWN THE BEACH,

20:03.100 --> 20:04.867
AND HOPEFULLY IT'LL GET
MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.000
HOPEFULLY, BUT, YOU KNOW,
NOT ME, OF COURSE,

20:07.033 --> 20:08.533
BUT I WISH
EVERYBODY GOOD LUCK.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.833
THANK YOU, I WOULD NOT
EXPECT YOU TO GET INVOLVED.

20:10.867 --> 20:12.533
WELL, IT'S A LOT
OF WORK.

20:12.567 --> 20:13.900
VOLUNTEERING.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.000
OH, AND
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

20:15.033 --> 20:18.733
I PASSED BY THAT
JEWELRY STORE ON 23rd

20:18.767 --> 20:20.833
AND I THINK I REALLY
DO WANT THAT BRACELET.

20:23.267 --> 20:26.433
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

20:26.467 --> 20:31.700
I WAS GONNA BUY YOU
THAT BRACELET TODAY.

20:31.733 --> 20:33.800
REALLY ?
I ALMOST BOUGHT IT.

20:33.833 --> 20:34.967
YOU DID ?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.600
YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE STORE WAS CLOSED.

20:37.633 --> 20:39.833
OH, WELL, YOU CAN
GET IT TOMORROW.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.233
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS...

20:45.267 --> 20:47.833
I WAS TALKING TO RICHARD LEWIS
ON THE PHONE EARLIER

20:47.867 --> 20:49.933
AND HE WAS
WITH ME TODAY, AND...

20:52.067 --> 20:54.800
HE JUST ASKED ME IF HE COULD
BUY IT FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND

20:54.833 --> 20:57.967
AND I GUESS I KINDA
TOLD HIM, "OKAY."

21:00.433 --> 21:03.267
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ?

21:03.300 --> 21:05.533
WELL, WE'D ALREADY
MADE UP.

21:05.567 --> 21:08.533
SO, I DON'T WANT THE BRACELET
BECAUSE WE MADE UP ?

21:08.567 --> 21:09.533
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.933
I KNOW IT DOESN'T,
IT WAS STUPID.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.633
LET'S JUST CALL HIM
AND TELL HIM

21:13.667 --> 21:16.400
THAT IT WAS A MIX-UP AND NOT
TO GET IT FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND.

21:16.433 --> 21:17.533
I'LL GET IT
FOR YOU TOMORROW, OKAY ?

21:17.567 --> 21:18.533
FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING.

21:18.567 --> 21:19.800
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO CALL HIM

21:19.833 --> 21:21.600
BECAUSE HIS GIRLFRIEND'S
GONNA PICK UP THE PHONE

21:21.633 --> 21:23.133
AND I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO HER.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.133
I'LL CALL, I'LL CALL.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.867
NO, NO, BECAUSE
HE'S GOT CALLER ID

21:25.900 --> 21:27.067
AND THEN I'M GONNA
BE ON THE PHONE WITH HIM

21:27.067 --> 21:30.067
FOR FIVE HOURS EXPLAINING
TO HIM WHY I HUNG UP.

21:30.067 --> 21:31.533
AND I DON'T WANT THAT.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.067
I'LL GET UP
AND GO DOWN THERE.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.700
I WILL BE THERE WHEN
THEY OPEN THE STORE.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.533
I WILL TURN THE KEY.

21:38.567 --> 21:41.433
I'LL GREET THEM
IN THE MORNING.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.500
IT'S ALL DONE.

21:42.533 --> 21:45.767
UNCLE LARRY
IS HERE, YEAH.

22:07.067 --> 22:10.533
LARRY ?
OH, OH.

22:10.567 --> 22:11.633
WHOA.

22:13.233 --> 22:14.500
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT ?

22:14.533 --> 22:18.133
WELL, I HAVE TO GET DRESSED UP
TO GO TO THIS JEWELRY STORE.

22:18.167 --> 22:20.100
OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK GREAT.

22:20.133 --> 22:21.100
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.500
WOW.

22:22.533 --> 22:24.567
WOULD YOU MIND HANDING ME
THAT SPORT JACKET
THERE, PLEASE ?

22:24.600 --> 22:27.333
I CAN BARELY MOVE,
I'M JUST SHOCKED.

22:27.367 --> 22:29.300
OH, THE RESTAURANT CALLED
WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SHOWER.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.300
THEY HAVE
THE CREDIT CARD ?

22:30.333 --> 22:31.367
YEAH.
OKAY, GREAT.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.367
SO, YOU DON'T
NEED MINE ?

22:32.400 --> 22:33.533
NO, I'M GONNA
GO PICK IT UP

22:33.567 --> 22:34.800
BEFORE I GO TO
THE JEWELRY STORE.

22:34.833 --> 22:35.767
OKAY.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.800
EXCUSE ME.

22:47.833 --> 22:48.967
OH, HI.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.367
HI, I CALLED EARLIER
ABOUT THE CREDIT CARD.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.233
OH, YEAH, OKAY,
LET'S SEE.

22:57.467 --> 22:58.667
UM, WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

22:58.700 --> 22:59.833
LARRY DAVID.

22:59.867 --> 23:01.333
ALRIGHT,
IT'S YOURS.

23:01.367 --> 23:02.333
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:02.367 --> 23:03.400
OKAY.

23:03.433 --> 23:05.367
HI, MORNING.

23:12.767 --> 23:13.800
FUCK !

23:16.733 --> 23:19.233
THE ONLY TABLE I HAVE
THAT NIGHT IS, UH...

23:19.267 --> 23:23.067
EXCUSE ME,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

23:23.067 --> 23:24.567
MY CAR'S BLOCKED IN.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.800
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S FROM THIS RESTAURANT.

23:26.833 --> 23:28.600
IT'S A BLACK BMW,
IT'S A CONVERTIBLE.

23:28.633 --> 23:30.167
IT'S PROBABLY
PERRY'S CAR.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.167
WHO'S PERRY ?

23:31.200 --> 23:33.433
THE CAPTAIN.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.300
HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.400
PERRY ?

23:41.633 --> 23:42.933
UM...

23:44.400 --> 23:45.433
COULD YOU PLEASE
DO ME A FAVOR ?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.600
I THINK YOU'RE
BLOCKING MY CAR.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.500
OH, DID YOU PARK IN
AN EMPLOYEE RESERVED SPACE ?

23:50.533 --> 23:51.833
I DID, I LEFT
MY CREDIT CARD HERE.

23:51.867 --> 23:53.567
I JUST HAD TO RUN
IN FOR 30 SECONDS.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.100
THAT'S ALL.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.167
OH, YOU'RE THE GUY
FROM YESTERDAY.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.167
SO, YOU GOT YOUR CARD ?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.167
YES, I DID.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.167
OH, GOOD.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.233
AND YOU HAD
THIS TABLE, TOO, RIGHT ?

24:00.267 --> 24:01.233
YES.

24:01.267 --> 24:02.467
AND THE TABLE WAS GOOD ?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.667
IT WAS GREAT,
WASN'T IT ?

24:04.700 --> 24:05.867
IT WAS OKAY.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.800
THE SERVICE WAS GOOD ?

24:07.833 --> 24:09.167
IT WAS FINE, YEAH.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.833
WE DID EVERYTHING,
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

24:10.867 --> 24:14.267
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY
WHEN WE HAVE GOOD SERVICE,

24:14.300 --> 24:15.933
WE GET TIPS.

24:15.967 --> 24:20.300
I THINK YOU LEFT SOMETHING
LIKE 30 PERCENT FOR THE WAITER

24:20.333 --> 24:22.933
AND YOU JUST DREW A LINE THROUGH
MY WAITER CAPTAIN TIP.

24:22.967 --> 24:25.100
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT
WAS SOMETHING.

24:25.133 --> 24:27.900
HOLD ON A SECOND.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.900
THE WAITER DIDN'T
GIVE YOU ANY MONEY ?

24:29.933 --> 24:32.400
NO, WAITERS DON'T TIP OUT
TO WAITER CAPTAINS.

24:32.433 --> 24:35.267
AND I MAKE A LIVING
OFF MY TIPS.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.967
THAT WAITER DIDN'T SHARE
THAT TIP WITH YOU ?

24:37.067 --> 24:38.600
NO, HE DIDN'T.

24:38.633 --> 24:41.367
THAT IS SO UNFAIR,
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.567
REALLY TERRIBLE.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.733
YEAH.

24:43.767 --> 24:46.067
YOU KNOW, I MEAN YOU MAKE
A LIVING OFF YOUR TIPS.

24:46.100 --> 24:48.900
AND HERE IS A 30 PERCENT TIP
AND HE GETS THE WHOLE THING.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.600
YEAH, AND A LINE RIGHT
THROUGH THE WAITER CAPTAIN.

24:53.067 --> 24:56.633
WELL, I WAS EMPHASIZING
WHAT AN EXTRAVAGANT TIP IT WAS

24:56.667 --> 24:57.633
IN SOME WAYS, I GUESS.

24:57.667 --> 24:58.900
NO, WELL,
THE WAITER'S--

24:58.933 --> 25:01.933
I WAS CALLING ATTENTION TO IT,
YOU KNOW, HERE...

25:01.967 --> 25:04.200
SHARE THIS.

25:04.233 --> 25:06.733
ACTUALLY, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, SO--

25:06.767 --> 25:08.067
LISTEN, I'LL MOVE
THE CAR FOR YOU.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.867
JUST GIVE ME
THE KEYS AND I'LL...

25:09.900 --> 25:11.433
I'LL MOVE YOUR CAR
AND I'LL PUT IT IN THE SPACE--

25:11.467 --> 25:13.167
IT'S GOT A SPECIAL CODE.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.533
IT'LL TAKE TWO SECONDS.

25:14.567 --> 25:18.467
STAY HERE, DO YOUR WORK
AND I'LL JUST GO MOVE THE CAR.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.900
YOU BETTER FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER MODE OF TRANSPORTATION.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.467
RICHARD !

25:56.500 --> 25:57.433
WAIT !

25:59.300 --> 26:00.300
