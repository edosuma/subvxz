WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.040
When the defendant shot
and killed Jamil Issa,

00:05.040 --> 00:07.720
he left a very substantial trail
of evidence.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.000
Armed police!

00:09.000 --> 00:10.960
The firearm recovered from his flat?

00:10.960 --> 00:13.720
The same weapon used in the murder.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.080
Traces of the victim's blood
were found

00:16.080 --> 00:18.280
beneath the defendant's fingernails.

00:18.280 --> 00:22.040
Hairs matching the defendants
were found in Mr Issa's car.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.240
CCTV of him driving
towards the murder site

00:25.240 --> 00:28.120
moments before Jamil Issa
was killed.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.720
The truth
is that I did not kill that boy.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.000
I sell cars.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.640
How much to stick Kyra in the back
seats for the night as well?

00:34.640 --> 00:37.480
You're a wasteman, Jamil.
You know that!

00:37.480 --> 00:39.480
But everything goes back to her.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.600
Ky. It's midnight, call me, yeah?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.920
Ky? I can't find her.
She, like, vanished.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.400
What do you mean "vanished"?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.240
Who else can you call
who knows, Kyra?

00:49.240 --> 00:51.560
Is this the person who stuck up
posters of the girl?

00:51.560 --> 00:54.000
I saw someone last night
who looks exactly like her.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.400
So I got my answer.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.560
Now I knew where she'd gone.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.800
Do you know where I could get a gun?
For YOU?

01:00.800 --> 01:02.360
She saw her and you let her go!

01:02.360 --> 01:03.560
She got driven off.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.160
So what's that stupid car
of yours for, then?!

01:06.160 --> 01:08.280
You drive and you follow her
and you bring her home!

01:27.720 --> 01:29.000
Oh, yo, wait up!

01:31.360 --> 01:33.720
Bruv, deal with me first.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.440
Nah, get out of here, man.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.720
Nah, come on, man, how much?

01:44.120 --> 01:45.160
I've got money.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.920
100 quid.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.200
I only got 80.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.520
What can I get for that?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.360
If I see you again, boy,
you get bodied.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.040
That's what you get for 80 quid.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.800
Come on. Nah, come on, man.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.680
Yo, you already took my money, man.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.760
I get at least ten minutes, no?

02:12.760 --> 02:13.920
Yo, hold up.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.800
HE CHUCKLES

02:18.640 --> 02:20.280
No, don't hurt him!

02:20.280 --> 02:21.960
Shut up, man! Ah!

02:21.960 --> 02:23.760
Did I tell you to talk, bitch?

02:23.760 --> 02:26.080
Did I? Shut up, man.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.440
No! Ah!

02:31.440 --> 02:35.320
HE SCREAMS AND GROANS

02:38.560 --> 02:41.080
Go! God!

02:41.080 --> 02:43.040
What have you done?!

02:43.040 --> 02:45.480
Go! Let me go! Let me go!

02:45.480 --> 02:47.840
Get in the car.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.520
No! Get in, Kyra.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.360
What have you done?

02:54.360 --> 02:57.720
Open the door!

02:57.720 --> 03:00.120
Let me out of the car!

03:00.120 --> 03:02.000
Let me out!

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
This can't happen.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.200
Let me out. You need to let me go!

03:06.200 --> 03:07.840
SOBS: Let me go.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.160
Fuck!

03:11.520 --> 03:13.400
Just listen to me!

03:15.720 --> 03:17.280
We're getting out of here.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.200
I need to get out. We're getting out
of here. Let me out!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.920
Let me out. You need to let me go.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.000
Just let me out, let me out...
Stop shouting!

03:25.000 --> 03:27.560
Just let me out of the car!
Stop shouting, Kyra! Come on!

03:27.560 --> 03:30.920
Ah! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

03:49.920 --> 03:51.120
You're safe now.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.040
I'll get you something
for your hands.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.400
We're going to be OK.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.640
I'll sort this out, yeah?

04:46.240 --> 04:47.480
Ky?

04:50.320 --> 04:52.640
Oh, shit. Kyra!

05:00.520 --> 05:01.920
Oh, shit!

05:15.640 --> 05:17.240
What's going on?

05:18.560 --> 05:20.280
What are you doing?
I've got to go back.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.160
Babe, what are you doing?
You don't understand...

05:25.080 --> 05:26.960
Please, Kyra, please.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.800
Please just don't go.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.880
Just stay for a minute, please.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.080
I know I just told you I shot a man,

06:05.080 --> 06:07.320
but he didn't die.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.920
And I'm not on trial for that.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.760
My QC told me under no circumstances
to tell you that story.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.120
He said it proves I had a gun
and I was willing to carry it

06:19.120 --> 06:21.200
and shoot someone with it.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.360
And that's all true.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.000
Even though I'm not on trial
for those things.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.040
Maybe you judge me for it.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.080
All I can do is give you the truth.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.960
Gunpowder residue evidence
is a result from a lab.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.760
All it says is SOMETHING happened.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.400
They say what happened
is I killed Jamil.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.920
But they're wrong.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.520
And that's the part
that matters here.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.800
My Lord, there is a legal matter
that needs to be dealt with

06:50.800 --> 06:53.240
in the absence of the jury.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.920
Members of the jury,
I will ask you to retire

06:56.920 --> 06:58.720
while we hear this argument.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.280
And can we clear the gallery,
please?

07:20.680 --> 07:22.880
As Miss Mahmood points out,

07:22.880 --> 07:27.000
you are very frequently
introducing new evidence,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.280
things you are now claiming
to have done.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.720
The jury will be told
to disregard it.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.080
And depending on how far you go,
I may consider allowing

07:37.080 --> 07:39.200
prosecution counsel
a right of reply.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.920
That will be my application
in due course, My Lord.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.680
The Crown believes
that the defendant

07:43.680 --> 07:47.520
is using his closing speech
to construct a work of fiction.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.880
We'd like the chance to make
that absolutely plain to the jury.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.920
I follow. Your Honour, I've got
all these points I need to make

07:56.920 --> 08:00.720
about the evidence, but if I leave
things out, it makes no sense.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.080
Kyra connects everything.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.000
I'm doing my best.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.720
Now...

08:08.840 --> 08:11.920
..which evidence
will you be discussing next?

08:15.960 --> 08:17.520
PAPER RUSTLES

08:20.320 --> 08:22.600
How my hair ended up in Jamil's car.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.440
Hello? Hi, can I speak with Jamil,
please?

08:28.440 --> 08:30.080
Qalbi. Phone!

08:31.480 --> 08:33.680
Yeah? Yo, look,

08:33.680 --> 08:36.480
I'm trying to work on this essay,
but...

08:36.480 --> 08:38.640
..but I don't even know
what the focus is.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.640
It's loyalty ladders,
Porter's five forces -

08:41.640 --> 08:43.720
it's all in the notes I gave you.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.680
Look, I got that thing for you,
didn't I?

08:45.680 --> 08:47.320
So get my essay done.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.760
You made that deal.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.840
Yeah, but...

08:48.760 --> 08:50.840
LINE DISCONNECTS

09:16.120 --> 09:17.800
FAINT RATTLING

09:23.320 --> 09:24.360
I locked it.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.800
I just don't understand.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.000
I'll always come back for you, Kyra.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.160
You've got to know this.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.680
DOOR CLOSES

10:43.000 --> 10:44.120
How you feeling?

11:11.280 --> 11:13.680
I can take her to my GP.
No, Mum, we can't do that.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.800
Someone might her.
Why is that a problem?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.120
You weren't there.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.160
Dragging her back to the car
was bad.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.160
How did this happen to her?
I don't understand.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.840
We need to look after her.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.920
All right? Let things die down.
It's just a few days.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.360
And keep her prisoner?

11:30.840 --> 11:32.240
Look at her, Mum.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.280
SHE SIGHS

11:34.280 --> 11:35.800
You saw her.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.040
She's not right,

11:39.040 --> 11:41.240
and she's not safe
being left on her own.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.280
So please.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.040
Look, I'm going to lose my job
if I don't go back.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.080
And I don't have anyone else.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.680
Hmm?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.120
SHE SIGHS

11:56.120 --> 11:57.320
Thank you.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.800
Hmm?

12:23.320 --> 12:24.720
I have to go.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.480
I should have got rid of the gun.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.120
And I tried to, believe me.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.560
But then I'm thinking...

12:49.560 --> 12:51.760
..what if Glockz find us?

13:02.640 --> 13:04.520
Believe me,
I've been where you are now.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.640
Looking at some bad choices
someone's made, thinking, "Idiot."

13:10.960 --> 13:12.600
Why get yourself into that mess?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.080
What did you expect would happen?

13:16.760 --> 13:19.000
And I've 100% judged those people,
too.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.280
But I promise you,

13:23.280 --> 13:25.080
it's different
when you're afraid.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.080
You know what the right thing is,

13:29.080 --> 13:30.760
but you don't feel safe enough
to do it.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.400
My head was a mess.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.000
I was trying to calm down,
telling myself we'd be OK.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.360
Cos all they really knew was the guy
who took Kyra was driving

13:45.360 --> 13:47.360
a blue BMW sports car.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.920
That's all they had.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.800
Got a bit of a ding there.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.760
Honestly, I'll take
whatever you can give me, Sam.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.280
Just need to downsize.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.760
Yeah, but a little run-around
after driving an M2?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.840
Putting my girl on the insurance,
innit?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.600
Need something a bit smaller
for the way that she's parking.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.040
Wait till you've got kids,

14:09.040 --> 14:11.560
then nothing matters
except the boot space.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.400
It's a tragedy.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.680
Do you want the same colour
as this one?

14:15.680 --> 14:19.040
Nah. Need to forget about this one.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.720
Well, what about that one?

14:20.720 --> 14:22.200
That's a good colour.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.640
Yeah, yeah... You don't like it.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.760
What? Any time you're lying,
you do that thing with your mouth.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.280
I've seen you do it
with the customers.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.360
All right, you got me.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.520
I don't like the green.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.200
Maybe we could try a silver or grey?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.240
Whichever you want, my friend.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.880
End of the day, I've sold
enough cars to know

14:51.880 --> 14:54.000
you're not the car you're driving.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.960
What mattered to me was Kyra.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.000
And she was safe now,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.720
even if she hadn't
exactly come back,

15:05.720 --> 15:07.200
if that makes sense.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.120
Couldn't really reach her.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.480
But her books,

15:11.480 --> 15:13.160
they always got through, you know,

15:13.160 --> 15:16.680
so I thought that's the one thing
I could try doing for her.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.640
BANGING ON DOOR

15:57.560 --> 16:00.640
Yo, Kyra, open up.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.960
We got to talk to you. Shit.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.200
Get the fucking door open!

16:06.200 --> 16:08.880
What's wrong with you, homie?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.440
BANGING ON DOOR

16:15.040 --> 16:16.840
Fucking hell.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.480
She ain't here, innit?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.640
But it's has she BEEN here?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.080
She's not been back.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.040
What, she ain't got no flatmate
or anything? Nah.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.160
Spooks says she lives on her own.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.560
Fuck what fucking Spooks says, yeah?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.760
Nah, bruv, trust me,
Spooks wants her found.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.760
Well, she ain't coming back here
after this.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.280
Oh, fuck.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.680
Yeah, we're done. Done.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.200
DOOR CLOSES

17:07.760 --> 17:10.360
FIRE ALARM BEEPS

17:16.520 --> 17:17.880
Fuck!

17:20.920 --> 17:22.440
HE COUGHS

17:40.880 --> 17:43.640
HE COUGHS

17:43.640 --> 17:45.280
Hey, look.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.120
Go! Go!

17:50.120 --> 17:52.360
Are you all right?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.880
Yo!

18:31.880 --> 18:33.520
People want it simple -

18:33.520 --> 18:36.200
guilty or not guilty,
innocent or not.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.640
I know that's the question
you have to answer about me.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.600
Even though maybe you know
the world isn't like that.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.120
If that is the question, though,

18:49.120 --> 18:50.760
then I am innocent.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.600
I'm telling you the truth.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.080
They only told her they'd purchased
the photograph in 1982.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.320
KNOCK ON DOOR

19:14.960 --> 19:16.720
Could you give us a minute, please?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.280
Went to your flat today.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.480
Wanted to get you some books.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.240
Ky, when I was there,
two guys broke in.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.080
They started a fire.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.640
I'm very sorry, I tried.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.080
All my books...

20:11.080 --> 20:12.120
Yeah.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.560
Everything's gone.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.000
They mentioned
someone called Spooks.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.240
Spooks is my brother.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.120
He's in prison.

20:33.200 --> 20:39.440
He, um, he got five years
for having a gun and dealing drugs.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.160
He gave the police information
about Glockz,

20:42.160 --> 20:44.120
and they found out.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.600
And I'm all he's got.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.160
So you sold yourself for him?

20:52.160 --> 20:53.320
Can you not say it like that?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.000
You gave up our whole life
for someone

20:55.000 --> 20:57.880
who was dealing drugs
and snaked on his own gang? Yes.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.680
Ky, if it was me,
I'd rather someone killed me

20:59.680 --> 21:02.440
than see Bless put to work
on the street
for something that I'd done.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.000
She'd do it for you, though.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.360
And Bless wouldn't ask you either,
she'd just do it.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.240
He didn't ask me.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.560
If you needed money...

21:18.720 --> 21:20.560
It wasn't about money.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.560
They wanted to hurt him
for what he did,

21:22.560 --> 21:24.480
and so they made me do it.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.120
And if I said no...

21:28.280 --> 21:29.400
..then they'd kill him.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.880
I had to choose.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.280
You chose him. Don't.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.320
Don't you fucking judge him.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.040
You are only a good person

21:42.040 --> 21:44.400
because your life has let you
live that way.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.600
SHE EXHALES

21:50.280 --> 21:52.440
I can't do this.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.280
I'm sorry. I can't, I can't.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.440
Ask me,
would I do those things for you?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.480
Yeah, I would.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.600
I know I would.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.680
I bought a gun.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.960
I shot a man.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.640
Those things ain't me,

22:11.640 --> 22:13.400
but I did them
cos I wanted to make sure

22:13.400 --> 22:14.440
you were safe.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.400
And I can see...

22:19.400 --> 22:21.160
I can see how what you did was love.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.840
And I hate it.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.960
But I can see it.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.680
You don't have to be with me.

22:39.680 --> 22:42.760
You don't owe me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

22:42.760 --> 22:44.840
SOBS: You don't owe me anything.
Hey, hey, hey.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.280
That's not it. Hey, that's not it.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.920
I'm here now.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.280
And that's not changing.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.960
What happens next,
we can talk about.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.880
But all I want right now
is for you to come home with me...

23:07.520 --> 23:09.720
..and for us to be together.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.880
You can always come back to me here.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.400
Let's say grace.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.560
SHE PRAYS

23:36.440 --> 23:39.800
Father, in the name of Jesus,
we thank you for this food

23:39.800 --> 23:41.800
and bringing Kyra back to us.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.480
Without her,
there was a hole in our family.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.360
Thank you for your grace
and for your love.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.040
In Jesus's mighty name, we pray.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.080
Amen.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.880
So we went home.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.520
In some ways, nothing had changed.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.560
Only...

24:04.040 --> 24:05.680
..everything had changed.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.000
I don't think they'll kill Spooks.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.680
Not until they know what's going on.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.240
They'll try and find me first.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.840
When was the last time you saw him?

24:28.920 --> 24:30.640
How come you don't see him,

24:30.640 --> 24:32.800
if it means that much to you?

24:32.800 --> 24:34.880
You didn't even tell me about him.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.600
Because you'd only end up
thinking you should help him,

24:37.600 --> 24:39.960
just because you love me.
Yeah, and what's wrong with that?

24:39.960 --> 24:42.640
You want to help him.
That's different.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.760
He's my brother.

24:44.760 --> 24:47.000
I love him.
And how is that different?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.680
Talk to me.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.680
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right?

25:03.760 --> 25:07.600
Spooks stole this from the school
library for my birthday present.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.760
I took it back to them,
but they let me keep it.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.160
I was in and out of school
and we moved around a lot.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.960
I don't know, it's just
it's just hard making friends.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.040
Maybe Spooks tried harder
than I did.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.280
He'd find out about
all the local teams

25:30.280 --> 25:32.200
and try and fit in that way.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.560
This one's about
a champion ice skater.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.120
And then the foster family

25:39.120 --> 25:41.960
we were staying with took us
to a real ice rink for my birthday.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.880
That was Spooks' idea.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.400
He was a really good brother.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.680
Tell me about him.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.120
I just want to know.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.720
Tell me.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.360
Tell me something fun
that he did.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.440
OK.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.680
I guess one thing
he used to do was...

26:14.760 --> 26:17.560
..put beans in a bit of bread,

26:17.560 --> 26:21.920
fold it in half and call it
a bean pie, you know,

26:21.920 --> 26:24.160
cos anything that's got
a filling is a pie.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.880
THEY CHUCKLE

26:26.880 --> 26:29.040
And I always thought
that was really funny.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.080
I don't know, it's just...

26:37.240 --> 26:38.920
I didn't read these ones
all that much,

26:38.920 --> 26:41.200
it's kind of weird
seeing them together.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
Just grabbed what I could, really.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.560
No.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.040
These are the ones I'd want.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.840
It's just some of them
are things I miss.

26:55.720 --> 26:56.760
I get that.

26:59.560 --> 27:03.440
I could only bring one bag
when we came to live here.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.320
I had to leave most of my books,
but I still remember them.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.200
Can that be enough now, please?

27:16.640 --> 27:18.040
Yeah.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.240
DOOR CLOSES

27:52.960 --> 27:54.360
You think back to the things

27:54.360 --> 27:56.280
that didn't make sense
at the time.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.080
And now they do.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.640
DOOR OPENS

28:06.800 --> 28:09.640
Hey, babe.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.280
Tea? Yes, please.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.720
You, eh,
might want to move your car.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.520
Yeah? Why?

28:20.520 --> 28:22.440
Don't want people go through it.

28:24.600 --> 28:28.040
Alishia's little brother
smashed the side window.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.040
I saw him do it. Seriously?

28:31.040 --> 28:34.360
Little fucker... Hey, stop.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.840
Hey, move, please. Just leave it.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.720
I'm going to kill him.
No, you're not.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.360
Move, please!

28:40.360 --> 28:42.840
You don't know
what's going on with him.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.920
Maybe he's hungry.
Maybe he owes someone money.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.440
Maybe he's an addict.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.800
Is that my problem, Ky?

28:49.320 --> 28:50.760
Exactly.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.880
If you go, then we are done.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.240
We are through, I swear it.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.120
Why do you give a shit
about this kid?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.880
You don't even know him.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.800
He'll have had a reason.

29:18.200 --> 29:22.760
Kyra laid low and I tried
to make things look normal.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.080
But maybe I didn't do
that good a job

29:30.080 --> 29:33.200
cos Sam knew
I had something going on.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.680
He kept giving me
all these motivational talks.

29:37.560 --> 29:41.560
So what I like to do is think
about the good things, you know,

29:41.560 --> 29:42.880
the good memories I got.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.800
And I let them...

29:44.800 --> 29:46.440
..yeah, infuse me.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.720
Infuse? Yeah, you know,
like a teabag.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.640
You let the good feelings
spread out through you.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.000
Helps you remember
we're only selling cars.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.600
Then - boom.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.200
Someone comes in and buys a car.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.520
SAM CHUCKLES

30:03.200 --> 30:06.520
Every time.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.080
Every time.

30:12.080 --> 30:15.880
This felt like it was maybe
one of those bad situations.

30:15.880 --> 30:20.800
So I tried, like Sam said,
just to let things go,

30:20.800 --> 30:22.560
think about better days.

30:27.720 --> 30:28.760
Nice.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.640
I loved my job.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.520
And I love my family.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.240
I just wanted everything
back to how it was.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.000
NO AUDIBLE SPEECH

30:52.000 --> 30:54.520
We had space to breathe.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.360
And even though I never stopped
looking over my shoulder,

30:59.360 --> 31:02.960
I was starting to feel like things
could end up being all right.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.840
HE CHUCKLES

31:25.440 --> 31:27.120
SHE CHUCKLES

31:32.960 --> 31:34.880
CAR WHIRS

31:34.880 --> 31:36.720
SHE GIGGLES

31:36.720 --> 31:38.440
Where did you find this, then?

31:38.440 --> 31:40.560
Got it out of your wardrobe.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
Oh, did you? Mm-hm.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.520
How was your day?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.000
Really boring.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.640
I'm good with that, though.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.920
Try to stay away from the windows
for a few more days.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.680
OK.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.800
Yo, man, I need to talk to you.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.400
Yo, man, I got work.
Bruv, fuck work.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.520
Look, if this has something to do
with the essay I wrote you...
Fuck the essay.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.440
There's north-man
coming around the estate.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
What? Man from north London,

32:25.440 --> 32:27.880
Tottenham, Camden.
All of them lot.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.480
Binks just got G-checked
by four of the Glockz mandem.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.240
I'm not on road.
I sell cars, you know this.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.880
Yeah, but Kel said that
they were asking about Kyra.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.680
Yeah, and so what? Why you got beef
in Camden anyway, bruv?

32:40.680 --> 32:43.720
Bruv, I've got business there,
like I got business everywhere,

32:43.720 --> 32:45.040
but I keep it on the low.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.720
Now they're in our ends,
my fucking doorstep.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.440
Do you understand? That's a problem.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.000
But that's not my problem, is it?

32:52.600 --> 32:55.440
Have you found Kyra, bruv? No.

32:57.320 --> 33:00.120
Hey, asking you a question, have you
found her? I said no, bruv!

33:00.120 --> 33:02.880
When you do, you need to tell her.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.800
Call whoever, do whatever.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.720
I do not want these man
in these ends, do you understand?

33:08.720 --> 33:12.440
All right, man. If I see her,
I'll tell her. Thank you.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.160
That's all I'm asking, man.
All right, man.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.240
Well done on the essay as well.
You've got a 70.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.880
You're welcome.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.960
What's that gun saying?

33:25.600 --> 33:26.880
That's all done with now.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.800
Look after yourself, yeah?

33:56.680 --> 33:58.960
That was it.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.200
The moment
the walls began closing in.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.120
PHONE BUZZES

34:15.400 --> 34:18.400
Hello? Good morning.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.920
We've got a parcel
we tried to deliver yesterday.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.440
Hold on.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.400
Can I confirm some details with you?

34:30.160 --> 34:31.440
Yeah, go on.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.000
Can I get your name
and the first line of your address?

34:36.480 --> 34:37.920
Yeah, sure.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.360
What's this parcel?

34:45.480 --> 34:46.880
I don't know what's in it.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.800
OK, and who are you?

34:50.800 --> 34:52.440
We're the courier company.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.240
Right.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.320
Where exactly
is this parcel meant to go?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.440
Can you confirm your address?

35:08.400 --> 35:10.000
Shit.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.640
If someone calls you
that you don't know,

35:17.640 --> 35:18.960
don't tell them anything.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.400
Why? What's happened?

35:21.400 --> 35:23.000
I think the Glockz got my number.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.640
Now they're trying to get
our address off me.

35:26.640 --> 35:30.400
Just don't answer the door,
right? And stay inside.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.040
And if anything dodgy looks like
it's happening, call the police.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.640
They're going to find us,
aren't they? Hey, no, no, no.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.280
I'll think of something, all right?

35:41.280 --> 35:45.120
Just...give me time to think. Yeah?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.040
No-one from your old estate
knows you live here, right?

35:51.040 --> 35:53.440
I didn't really talk
to my neighbours.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.120
So how the fuck
have they got my number

35:55.120 --> 35:57.080
and how are they tracking you
to this estate?

35:57.080 --> 35:58.920
I don't know. How did you find me?

36:07.280 --> 36:09.360
I had put those things up
everywhere.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.040
My phone number
was right there for anyone to get.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.600
Put stuff online as well.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.320
A million things linking me
to her.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.560
And my photo
was on the dealership website.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.160
I mean, if you were looking for me,
I wasn't hard to find.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.640
And nobody's come looking for us
at our house?

36:29.640 --> 36:31.840
KYRA: No, nothing all day.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.600
OK, good.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.240
What's going on? Talk to me.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.000
It's nothing.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.360
Talk to me.
Look, it's cool, all right?

36:41.360 --> 36:42.600
We're good.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.280
Be back soon. OK.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.760
Be careful. OK.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.920
Yo, come here, man.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.040
Them Glockz ain't going away. OK.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.280
You found Kyra, didn't you?

37:06.280 --> 37:09.120
What? Kyra, man!

37:09.120 --> 37:13.040
I know you found her,
cos you stopped looking for her,

37:13.040 --> 37:15.240
and I seen her up there
in your flat.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.320
What? Is she up there?

37:21.320 --> 37:23.400
I ain't seen her.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.200
All right?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.400
And if you've seen girls
in my flat, then maybe that's

37:27.400 --> 37:29.560
because I get girls, Jamil.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.360
And the reason
that I stopped looking for her

37:32.360 --> 37:34.160
is cos I stopped
giving a shit about her.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.920
But just for you, yeah?

37:37.920 --> 37:39.840
If I see her,
I'll give her your number.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.720
You're a shit liar, man.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.720
I know you got that gun
to get Kyra back.

37:44.720 --> 37:50.160
If I was you, I would tell that girl
to pack her fucking bag today.

37:50.160 --> 37:53.160
Cos them boys do not fuck about,
do you hear me?

37:53.160 --> 37:56.440
I'm telling you, she ain't there.
Mm.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.600
We'll see.

37:59.600 --> 38:04.040
All I know is that the next time
them Glockz boys come round here,

38:04.040 --> 38:06.680
I'm sending them your way, cuz,

38:06.680 --> 38:09.440
cos she was your girl.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.800
And I haven't her cause
any more trouble for me.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.120
Hey.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.200
What's wrong?

38:32.520 --> 38:34.560
Jamil knows you're here.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.360
He's been dealing all over London,
including Camden,

38:38.360 --> 38:41.240
so Glockz are going
to recognise him, and he knows that,

38:41.240 --> 38:44.160
and he knows
that they're looking for you.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.480
So he's going to tell them
where you are.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.800
Would he really do that?

38:48.800 --> 38:50.280
Yes.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.520
Yes, he would do that.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.080
He literally just said
that's what he was going to do.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.560
Well, what do we do?

38:56.800 --> 38:57.960
I'm going to handle it...

38:59.640 --> 39:01.080
..but I need to see your brother.

39:03.480 --> 39:06.000
Don't tell him that I know you,
just set it up.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.440
Yeah?

39:15.960 --> 39:18.160
Mate, what is this?

39:18.160 --> 39:20.120
It's about Kyra.
But I don't know you from nowhere.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.360
Spooks, I ain't got all day.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.840
I know where she is
and I know she called you,

39:23.840 --> 39:25.760
so are you going to sit down
or not?

39:31.040 --> 39:32.480
Is she OK, yeah?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.880
I can tell you who took her.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.920
Who shot that Glockz boy
when he was doing it.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.880
Same guy been shooting crack
in Camden,

39:48.880 --> 39:52.000
stealing Glockz's business,
and they don't even know his name.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.600
Don't know who he is.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.880
Who the fuck are you?

39:58.960 --> 40:00.920
You've got a deal with them, innit?

40:00.920 --> 40:03.800
Yeah, you give them the name
of the guy who took Kyra,

40:03.800 --> 40:05.640
then you're back in with them,
right?

40:05.640 --> 40:08.000
Brother, what you want from me?
You can see I'm in jail.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.320
What'd you come here for, money?
It's a start.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.800
So, who is it, then?
I still got questions.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.840
Questions... This guy, bruv...

40:18.840 --> 40:20.560
Do you know
what happened to Kyra?

40:22.440 --> 40:25.280
What you want to know about all this
for? Answer the fucking question.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.920
Yeah, they told me, innit.

40:29.920 --> 40:33.680
You agreed to that? No. Your sister
being put to work on the streets
cos of something that you did?

40:33.680 --> 40:36.200
SPOOKS SUCKS TEETH

40:33.680 --> 40:36.200
Come on, man.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.760
Fuck's sake, man!

40:37.760 --> 40:40.440
Pack it in, or you can join him.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.080
Right. Give it up, man.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.600
They told me about it afterwards,
man.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.760
Yeah? What did you do about that?

40:48.760 --> 40:50.360
You think you know me?

40:52.600 --> 40:55.280
Come on. You think I ain't changed?

40:57.720 --> 40:59.480
I even got stabbed.

40:59.480 --> 41:02.080
And as soon as I got out of the
hospital, you know what they done?

41:02.080 --> 41:04.280
They said, "It's cool, bro.

41:05.360 --> 41:06.720
"Kyra sorted it."

41:10.400 --> 41:12.440
You got family, bro?

41:12.440 --> 41:13.720
We're not talking about me.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.080
She's safe, yeah?
Yeah, man, she's safe.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.640
Swear to God...

41:26.880 --> 41:29.440
And she ain't going to go back? No.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.000
Look, I got a little 5K in a bango
in Tottenham.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.600
I can't spend it, you can have it.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.360
Where?

41:41.360 --> 41:43.800
Name first.
Do I look like a dickhead?

41:47.200 --> 41:51.360
Godwinson House, Broadleaf Estate.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.960
Bango, third floor.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.720
So what's his name, then?

42:01.440 --> 42:03.160
The guy who took her
is called Jamil.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.400
Sometimes he goes by JC.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.400
Lives on Wyndham Estate
in Camberwell.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.520
He's been doing it all
right under their noses.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.520
If they look for it,
they'll find him.

42:20.680 --> 42:21.960
Jamil, yeah?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.360
Yeah, we'll find him.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.280
Glockz had a name now.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.120
And once they start looking
into what Spooks told them,

42:32.120 --> 42:33.440
it will all look real.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.760
I gave them that name.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.160
Yeah, that's him.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.080
Kyra knew nothing.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.440
Had to keep her out of it.
Keep her safe.

42:42.440 --> 42:46.240
If Spooks says Jamil took Kyra
as well, then it's true.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.320
Now, all that's left is
what they're going to do about it.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.840
You know
what they're going to do about it.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.680
Even if Jamil calls Glockz now,
they're not believing him.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.880
They've seen what he's doing.

43:31.440 --> 43:32.720
I know what I've done.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.520
What it means for him now.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.160
And I was waiting.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.240
I'm sorry.

44:07.400 --> 44:11.960
SHE SINGS

45:11.840 --> 45:13.480
This looks beautiful.

45:19.560 --> 45:24.320
Sometimes I think it's like books
are letting me feel close to life,

45:24.320 --> 45:25.720
but not be in it.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.560
And I want to go somewhere now.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.640
I want to go away with you and...

45:35.320 --> 45:38.280
..do some things
without a book in my hand.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.880
Does that make sense?

46:15.600 --> 46:17.440
Yo!

46:18.440 --> 46:19.880
GUNSHOTS

46:21.480 --> 46:22.520
Oh, my God.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.520
RAPID GUNFIRE

46:27.960 --> 46:30.240
What can you see?
I can't really see.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.040
It's too far.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.600
Oh, shit.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.480
What's wrong? Are you OK?

46:46.520 --> 46:48.920
DISTANT SIRENS

46:57.280 --> 47:00.480
I only ever wanted
to protect the people I loved.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.400
And I can't say all my choices
were good, but...

47:03.400 --> 47:05.640
..I don't know,
maybe that's just it,

47:05.640 --> 47:08.760
but that is not the same
as me being guilty over Jamil.

47:08.760 --> 47:14.280
And, yeah, I was willing to let
Jamil die, but I did not kill him.

47:19.240 --> 47:21.520
BANGING ON DOOR

47:28.280 --> 47:30.360
Wait. What if it's Glockz?

47:30.360 --> 47:32.240
BANGING CONTINUES

47:32.240 --> 47:35.000
BINKS: Come on, man, open up. Fuck.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.680
All right, get under the bed.
Don't come out.

47:37.680 --> 47:39.040
I'm not losing you!

47:39.040 --> 47:41.120
Hey, they not going anywhere,
are they?

47:41.120 --> 47:42.800
But I need to know you're safe.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.800
BANGING ON DOOR

47:44.800 --> 47:46.720
Open the door,
or I'm booting it down.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.160
Go.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.360
Step out, fam.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.160
What are you guys doing here?
We'll talk later, man, let's go.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.000
Go where, man? I got work
in tomorrow... Tough.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.240
Come out of the house.

48:18.360 --> 48:21.280
Yo, at least let me grab my jacket!
Shut up, man.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.560
You heard all that gunfire?

48:29.880 --> 48:31.440
Yeah, I heard.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.200
You haven't got no questions
about that?

48:47.600 --> 48:49.560
Yo, baby!

48:49.560 --> 48:52.080
Yo, my name is JC.
Remember that, yeah?

48:53.600 --> 48:56.080
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

48:57.560 --> 48:59.080
Fuck!

49:02.000 --> 49:04.320
Right, go, go, go, go!

49:04.320 --> 49:07.520
Oh, fuck! Go, go, go, man! Go! Fuck!

49:10.480 --> 49:13.480
LAUGHTER

49:13.480 --> 49:16.320
JC, yeah? Remember that!

49:19.880 --> 49:21.320
Where are you taking me?

49:31.400 --> 49:36.520
I knew lots of little things
about Jamil, but at that point,

49:36.520 --> 49:38.720
I really didn't know
the big picture.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.800
I had no idea who he was
and what he could put together.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.160
SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE

50:06.520 --> 50:08.360
I'd break your arms.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.480
That's how my hair
got into Jamil's car.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.040
Not because we were friends.

50:20.040 --> 50:22.480
Not because we were selling drugs
to each other.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.000
It's because
they dragged me in there.

50:28.040 --> 50:30.480
The prosecution's whole case
is like that, though.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.800
They've got all these little bits
of evidence,

50:34.800 --> 50:38.000
but the way they put it together
isn't even close to what happened.

50:39.440 --> 50:43.520
Jamil was always one step ahead
of Glockz, and me.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.720
So, yeah...

50:48.800 --> 50:50.400
..they put me in their car.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.560
Didn't know where
they were taking me, but...

50:58.800 --> 51:03.560
..I gave up Jamil,
so maybe I deserved this.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.400
The way they were driving

51:07.400 --> 51:09.920
took us past all these places
I've known from day.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.840
What you need to understand, cuz,
is you brought this on yourself.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
You ain't got no-one
to blame but you.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.920
Those places where
we used to kick around bored.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.640
A lot of nothing places
I hadn't looked twice at for years

51:38.640 --> 51:40.960
all of a sudden
started meaning things to me.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.160
And I wanted so much to be
back there, but you can't, can you?

51:48.600 --> 51:51.760
Can't ever really go back
and correct the choices.

52:12.800 --> 52:16.160
The shop where we used to rent DVDs
on the weekend,

52:16.160 --> 52:19.360
and it was always a row with Mum
over what Bless wanted,

52:19.360 --> 52:21.800
and Bless saying
she'd watch whatever I wanted.

52:26.840 --> 52:30.480
And I'm sat there
thinking I'm going off to die,

52:30.480 --> 52:33.800
and sort of wishing that I'd said,
even just once, "You know what?

52:35.360 --> 52:38.360
"It's her turn. Let Bless pick."

52:45.280 --> 52:46.960
We go past a church,

52:46.960 --> 52:48.840
and it's not even
the one Mum goes to,

52:48.840 --> 52:51.600
but all the same,
it puts her in my head.

52:51.600 --> 52:54.080
And then I'm thinking about
her and Bless burying me,

52:54.080 --> 52:56.440
and I'm hoping they know
it wasn't for nothing.

52:59.520 --> 53:02.960
Because what I tried to do for Kyra,
that was the right thing,

53:02.960 --> 53:04.520
and I believe that.

53:04.520 --> 53:07.320
OK, it's not some big cause.

53:07.320 --> 53:09.280
It's not going to go
in any history books.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.560
I've had a small life,
and I'm good with that.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.720
But I've loved someone.

53:26.240 --> 53:27.760
And I've tried to help them.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.880
I've tried.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.560
HE SOBS QUIETLY
