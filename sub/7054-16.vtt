<i>Previously, on Fringe...</i>

00:03.357 --> 00:04.424
I want what you want.

00:04.492 --> 00:07.561
What do you think
we should do about that?

00:09.363 --> 00:11.531
The laws of physics
are being disrupted here.

00:11.599 --> 00:13.199
Like the other universe,

00:13.251 --> 00:16.036
our world is starting
to come apart at the seams.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.971
Am I responsible for this?

00:18.038 --> 00:21.641
- You don't know that to be true.
- Unfortunately, I do.

00:21.709 --> 00:24.177
What happens to the body's
energy after death.

00:24.228 --> 00:25.812
William theorized
we should be able

00:25.880 --> 00:28.398
to capture that energy
using what he called

00:28.482 --> 00:29.883
"soul magnets."

00:29.934 --> 00:31.101
He said if he were right,

00:31.185 --> 00:33.186
he would contact me
from the great beyond.

00:33.237 --> 00:36.356
The last will and testament
of William Bell.

00:36.407 --> 00:39.292
Nina,
a memento of me.

I didn't realize until later.

00:55.459 --> 01:00.380
I woke up,
and there she was in my bed.

01:00.431 --> 01:02.265
Yoko.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.516
What did he say?

01:04.584 --> 01:09.356
It was the '70s.
What could he say?

01:16.530 --> 01:19.366
This is wonderful, Kevin.

01:19.433 --> 01:23.136
You getting to sit here
all night,

01:23.204 --> 01:25.505
looking at these monitors.

01:25.573 --> 01:27.741
What a magnificent job.

01:27.792 --> 01:32.479
CEO of Massive Dynamic
is not a bad gig either.

01:32.546 --> 01:34.881
Must be nice, all that power.

01:34.949 --> 01:38.952
It was Belly's intellect
made the company great.

01:39.003 --> 01:42.806
All I've managed to do
with its vast resources

01:42.890 --> 01:46.676
is to create a new flavor
of cupcake frosting.

01:49.063 --> 01:52.632
Bacon-berry.

01:52.683 --> 01:55.151
Well, not for nothing,

01:55.219 --> 01:59.322
but I've worked for Mr. Bell
for a long time,

01:59.390 --> 02:02.359
and you're the best boss
I've ever had.

02:20.544 --> 02:22.379
Look at them,

02:22.463 --> 02:24.681
moving through the halls.

02:24.765 --> 02:26.716
There's a rhythm to it.

02:26.801 --> 02:28.351
A cadence.

02:28.436 --> 02:32.138
Each monitor is
its own movement.

02:32.189 --> 02:36.810
All blending together
in a beautiful symphony.

02:39.363 --> 02:40.497
What's in that room there?

02:40.564 --> 02:42.482
No one ever goes in there.

02:42.533 --> 02:44.951
You know what that is,
don't you?

02:45.019 --> 02:47.804
That's William Bell's office.

02:53.861 --> 02:55.662
Walter, what are you doing?

02:55.713 --> 02:57.530
I have spent the last
two hours in Belly's old office.

02:57.581 --> 02:59.382
I found the most
amazing things.

02:59.467 --> 03:02.052
Animal ESP, morality detector,

03:02.136 --> 03:03.837
viral dreaming,
powdered water,

03:03.888 --> 03:05.005
some of our best ideas.

03:05.056 --> 03:06.473
Walter, why are you
going through

03:06.540 --> 03:08.041
William's old research files?

03:08.092 --> 03:09.893
You know as well as I do

03:09.977 --> 03:12.095
that our universes
are on a collision path.

03:12.179 --> 03:14.314
I have to protect our world.

03:14.381 --> 03:17.217
If Belly were here,
he wouldn't let everyone down.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.085
Walter, you're not
letting anyone down.

03:19.153 --> 03:20.770
William would
have worked out

03:20.855 --> 03:23.023
what the machine does
and how it relates to Peter.

03:23.074 --> 03:24.858
And to make matters worse,

03:24.909 --> 03:27.110
for the first time since
we've been reunited,

03:27.194 --> 03:29.395
Peter is truly happy.

03:29.447 --> 03:32.382
- Oh? How so?
- Peter and Olivia.

03:32.450 --> 03:35.418
I thought you knew.

03:35.486 --> 03:38.204
They're a couple now.

03:38.255 --> 03:41.174
- Wow, well, that's wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

03:41.241 --> 03:45.211
And his happiness
is a constant reminder

03:45.262 --> 03:47.630
of the price of my failure,

03:47.715 --> 03:50.433
of what will be lost
if I don't succeed.

03:50.518 --> 03:53.603
And I sat there, and...
Looking at these,

03:53.687 --> 03:57.891
feeling depressed,
missing my old friend,

03:57.942 --> 04:01.694
wondering if I could
succeed without him,

04:01.762 --> 04:03.730
thinking how good
we were together.

04:03.781 --> 04:09.268
But then I remembered
how good we were together.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.205
And then I realized

04:12.272 --> 04:15.542
that maybe these
contained a solution.

04:15.609 --> 04:17.777
Maybe if I went
through these files,

04:17.827 --> 04:20.579
every detail,
every thought pattern,

04:20.630 --> 04:23.616
then maybe I could
remember how to think

04:23.667 --> 04:25.451
the way I used to,

04:25.503 --> 04:27.420
the way we used to

04:27.471 --> 04:30.256
back when there were
no limitations,

04:30.307 --> 04:32.642
back when anything
was possible.

05:32.369 --> 05:36.456
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

05:37.541 --> 05:38.691
Hey!

05:43.547 --> 05:46.365
- Koenig!
- Come on!

05:46.417 --> 05:48.218
Let me see your hands!

06:02.216 --> 06:04.500
Oh, my God.

March fiftth.

06:34.374 --> 06:35.675
Initial testing
on the memory discs

06:35.759 --> 06:36.959
I retrieved
from the shape-shifters

06:37.010 --> 06:38.461
revealed no information.

06:38.512 --> 06:40.463
However, the daisy-chain
wiring pattern

06:40.514 --> 06:41.881
seems to have activated them,

06:41.965 --> 06:45.634
somehow revealing tons
of previously undetected data.

06:45.686 --> 06:49.338
Unfortunately,
I have absolutely no idea

06:49.389 --> 06:52.007
how the hell to read it.

07:02.903 --> 07:03.903
Hey.

07:03.987 --> 07:05.404
I thought you were
gonna sleep in.

07:05.489 --> 07:07.239
<i>I thought you were gonna
let me sleep in.</i>

07:07.324 --> 07:10.493
Well, I woke up early and
it's actually warm outside.

07:10.544 --> 07:12.912
<i>And there's this great street fair
on Memorial Drive.</i>

07:12.996 --> 07:15.548
- You like a street fair?
- I love a good street fair.

07:15.632 --> 07:17.333
And you're not so bad yourself.

07:17.401 --> 07:19.885
<i>So I figured because
you're on the way...</i>

07:19.970 --> 07:21.554
Actually,
I'm not home right now.

07:21.638 --> 07:23.339
Oh.

07:23.390 --> 07:25.391
Yeah, I got up early
and went to the gym.

07:25.475 --> 07:27.510
<i>Oh, well, I wouldn't want
to interrupt your workout.</i>

07:27.561 --> 07:29.345
No, no, I'm almost done.

07:29.396 --> 07:32.014
Just let me shower up,
and I'll meet you in fifteen.

07:32.065 --> 07:33.933
Perfect.
I'll swing by the house.

07:34.017 --> 07:36.018
<i>Bye.</i>

07:40.907 --> 07:42.691
<i>Please say a command.</i>

07:42.743 --> 07:44.276
Read text.

07:44.361 --> 07:46.895
<i>I need you
and the Bishops.</i>

07:49.032 --> 07:52.418
It's magical.

07:52.502 --> 07:53.902
"They glanced up

07:53.954 --> 07:57.072
"and saw Icarus
float through the sky,

07:57.124 --> 07:58.740
"and taking him for a God,

07:58.792 --> 08:00.376
they stood still in wonder."

08:00.427 --> 08:02.261
Icarus had wings.

08:02.345 --> 08:05.414
We have no idea
what's keeping him up there.

08:05.465 --> 08:08.134
He was shot by a security guard
early this morning.

08:08.218 --> 08:09.585
The guard said
he found two of them

08:09.636 --> 08:11.437
coming down from the roof.

08:11.521 --> 08:13.305
There's no alarm
on the upper windows.

08:13.390 --> 08:15.775
Apparently they
used their ability

08:15.859 --> 08:17.109
to get up there.

08:17.194 --> 08:18.778
What a marvelous way to pilfer.

08:18.862 --> 08:20.646
So the other one got away?

08:20.730 --> 08:24.099
Ooh.

08:29.156 --> 08:31.773
This man is dead.

08:31.825 --> 08:33.275
Assuming he is a man.

08:33.326 --> 08:37.046
I thought I saw him
reach for a gun so I shot him,

08:37.113 --> 08:38.614
and then he just floated away.

08:38.664 --> 08:42.001
Okay, so the other one,
the one who got away,

08:42.085 --> 08:43.335
this is what he looked like?

08:43.419 --> 08:45.287
Yeah, but his hair was longer.

08:45.338 --> 08:47.389
Any idea what they were after?

08:47.457 --> 08:49.141
We've been through most
of the precious metals already,

08:49.226 --> 08:50.643
the gold, the platinum.

08:50.727 --> 08:52.144
Doesn't look like
anything was taken.

08:52.229 --> 08:54.463
I mean, they went to a lot
of trouble to get in here.

08:54.514 --> 08:56.565
So they must
have been after something.

08:56.633 --> 08:58.234
Agent Broyles.

08:58.301 --> 09:01.487
We found a key card
on the dead man.

09:01.555 --> 09:02.804
This used in the building?

09:02.856 --> 09:04.273
No, we're still
old-fashioned bolt and key.

09:04.324 --> 09:06.192
Contact the manufacturer.

09:06.276 --> 09:07.526
Let's find out
what door it unlocks.

09:07.611 --> 09:09.745
Agent Dunham.

09:09.812 --> 09:11.030
You got something?

09:11.114 --> 09:12.414
We know what the thieves took.

09:14.534 --> 09:16.652
Well...

09:16.703 --> 09:19.171
I think I know how they
achieved counterbalance.

09:19.256 --> 09:21.674
The boots are weighted.

09:21.758 --> 09:25.327
Hold still,
you infernal creature.

09:27.097 --> 09:29.548
So still thinking
he's not human, Walter?

09:29.633 --> 09:31.350
Mustn't rule anything out.

09:33.887 --> 09:35.504
Huh, that's odd.

09:35.555 --> 09:37.556
Those calf muscles
are extremely atrophied.

09:37.641 --> 09:40.226
You don't utilize muscles
when you float.

09:40.310 --> 09:43.863
Astronauts in space lose
5% of their body mass a week.

09:43.947 --> 09:46.282
Of course,
deterioration like this,

09:46.349 --> 09:48.317
he would have had to be
weightless for some time.

09:48.368 --> 09:50.686
But the chest and shoulders
are all perfectly normal.

09:50.737 --> 09:52.238
Wouldn't that affect
the entire body?

09:52.322 --> 09:54.156
Yes.

09:54.207 --> 09:56.992
Hey, do you guys know
anything about osmium?

09:57.043 --> 09:59.245
Uh, it's a metal, durable.

09:59.329 --> 10:02.498
Used in electrical contacts
and fountain pen nibs. Why?

10:02.549 --> 10:04.250
Well, the warehouse is missing
a substantial quantity.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.201
So I think maybe that's what
our thieves were after.

10:06.253 --> 10:07.536
Well, that's weird
though bec...

10:07.587 --> 10:09.371
Because osmium
is extremely rare,

10:09.422 --> 10:11.223
but isn't all that valuable.

10:11.308 --> 10:13.309
No, but it's ironic.

10:13.376 --> 10:16.729
Osmium is twice
as dense as lead.

10:16.813 --> 10:19.732
It's the heaviest
element on earth.

10:19.816 --> 10:24.403
It's like using balloons
to steal bowling balls.

10:27.274 --> 10:28.407
That would require

10:28.491 --> 10:30.242
that the cockpit
be resistant to radiation

10:30.327 --> 10:32.578
- at higher altitudes, no?
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.662 --> 10:33.746
So why don't we try to blend it

10:33.830 --> 10:35.080
with a slightly
denser compound?

10:35.165 --> 10:38.400
Do you have anything in mind?

10:38.451 --> 10:41.337
Dr. Krick?

10:41.404 --> 10:43.872
I'm sorry, Scotty.
Give me a minute, will you?

10:48.762 --> 10:52.047
- What are you doing here?
- Koenig is dead.

10:52.098 --> 10:53.749
There was a guard.
He shot him.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.619
His body?

10:56.686 --> 10:58.920
I left it.
I had to.

10:58.972 --> 11:00.773
What do we do?

11:00.857 --> 11:04.393
Go home.
I'll figure something out.

11:04.444 --> 11:06.111
There's something else.

11:09.115 --> 11:11.867
I've been nauseous.

11:11.934 --> 11:14.403
And my head is killing me.

11:14.454 --> 11:17.539
I didn't feel like this
the last time.

11:17.607 --> 11:20.108
Did you get what I asked for?

11:20.160 --> 11:22.110
Not here, not here.

11:22.162 --> 11:23.095
Go to the lab.

11:23.163 --> 11:26.215
Wait for me there.

11:29.502 --> 11:33.288
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

11:45.431 --> 11:46.748
What exactly am I
looking for here, Walter?

11:46.799 --> 11:48.767
Anything related to gravity.

11:48.851 --> 11:50.052
I think I remember

11:50.103 --> 11:52.521
seeing a file
on floaters in there.

11:52.588 --> 11:54.272
Of course it could
have been from the period

11:54.357 --> 11:57.225
when Belly was in search
of the perfect bowel movement.

11:57.276 --> 12:01.730
- Charming.
- Everybody poops, dear.

12:01.781 --> 12:05.433
- Personal floatation devices?
- Read that one to me.

12:05.485 --> 12:08.203
"The balloon is to be swallowed
and then inflated with helium

12:08.270 --> 12:10.372
via a tube inserted
into the subject's..."

12:10.439 --> 12:13.825
Yes, we never really did
solve that design issue.

12:13.910 --> 12:18.296
I suspect that's why we
didn't get many volunteers.

12:18.381 --> 12:21.666
And no helium
in the blood works

12:21.751 --> 12:23.718
and no indication
of anything gaseous,

12:23.786 --> 12:24.803
hydrogen, methane.

12:24.887 --> 12:26.287
Now this is interesting.

12:26.339 --> 12:28.957
His white blood cell
count is low.

12:29.008 --> 12:30.625
He's got a weakened
immune system.

12:30.676 --> 12:31.893
Perhaps what's
making him float

12:31.961 --> 12:34.563
is attacking
his body's defenses.

12:34.630 --> 12:38.100
Well, whatever it is,

12:38.151 --> 12:40.569
I think the effects
are wearing off.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.070
Hey.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.805
Any news on the second subject?

12:43.856 --> 12:47.159
- So far he is not in the system.
- What'd you find?

12:47.243 --> 12:49.077
Well, the key card that
we found on the balloon man,

12:49.145 --> 12:51.079
the manufacturer traced it
to a warehouse in Allston.

12:51.147 --> 12:52.864
Perfect.
Let's take a ride.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.152
Hmm.

12:57.203 --> 12:59.204
- What's up?
- Nothing.

12:59.288 --> 13:01.123
When your mother
and I were courting,

13:01.174 --> 13:03.592
we used to take
long walks in the park.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.710
But I can see
for your generation

13:05.795 --> 13:08.763
that a drive to a warehouse
would be just as enchanting.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.331
Right.

13:10.383 --> 13:12.801
Call us if
you learn anything.

13:28.618 --> 13:30.785
What's happening to me?

13:35.741 --> 13:36.741
Oh, no.

13:40.580 --> 13:45.133
I don't understand.

13:45.201 --> 13:46.718
You said if I got more
of that stuff

13:46.802 --> 13:47.869
that it would be permanent.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.471
Yes, I'm working on that.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.256
Then why am I getting sick?

13:51.340 --> 13:53.208
You can't defy gravity
without consequences.

13:53.259 --> 13:55.427
That's the problem.

13:57.847 --> 13:59.181
You're a pioneer.

13:59.232 --> 14:01.299
Men like you,

14:01.367 --> 14:03.351
your participation
in this experiment

14:03.402 --> 14:04.986
will help me discover a way

14:05.054 --> 14:07.405
to eliminate the side effects.

14:07.490 --> 14:11.493
I believe we may be
just about there.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.045
Doesn't make any sense.

14:30.096 --> 14:33.381
There's nothing here that would
alter body density.

14:35.584 --> 14:40.255
- 2:35, Astrid!
- Walter, I'm right here.

14:40.306 --> 14:44.476
Pick him up and
put him on a table.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.696
Body has dropped three feet

14:47.763 --> 14:49.430
in the last half hour.

14:49.482 --> 14:51.616
Like a dying balloon.

14:51.701 --> 14:54.369
You ever seen a balloon
lose its buoyancy so inconsistently?

14:54.436 --> 14:56.554
No, no, no, no.
Something is eluding me.

14:56.622 --> 14:57.756
Walter, I can't...

14:57.823 --> 14:58.957
I don't expect you
to solve it, dear.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.075
It's a very difficult problem.

15:00.126 --> 15:01.943
No, I mean...

15:01.994 --> 15:03.945
I mean him.
He's too heavy.

15:13.306 --> 15:15.290
Dear God.

15:15.341 --> 15:17.008
He weighs a ton.

15:17.093 --> 15:19.177
What...

15:19.262 --> 15:21.229
What is it?

15:21.297 --> 15:24.899
Take another sample
of his blood.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.768
Run a test for osmium.

15:26.819 --> 15:28.937
Well, you think that...

15:28.988 --> 15:31.139
Why would that make him float?

15:31.190 --> 15:32.824
It can't, of course.

15:32.908 --> 15:35.076
That's what's troubling me.

15:41.517 --> 15:42.574
Your turn now.

15:42.585 --> 15:44.536
- Okay, I got one.
- Okay.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.288
You know when we're watching TV

15:46.339 --> 15:48.006
and you start to rub my back,

15:48.090 --> 15:49.791
and you're not really
paying attention

15:49.842 --> 15:51.009
'cause you're
kind of distracted?

15:51.077 --> 15:52.260
Yeah.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.596
And you turn your hand
in a circle

15:54.663 --> 15:58.767
just over and over
and over and...

15:58.834 --> 16:00.001
I wouldn't say that's
exactly how it is,

16:00.052 --> 16:01.469
but yes, I know what
you're talking about.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.138
It's kinda like you're
burrowing through the muscle

16:03.189 --> 16:05.724
right into the bone.

16:05.808 --> 16:07.559
Okay, I think I get the point.

16:07.643 --> 16:09.344
Okay.

16:09.395 --> 16:10.729
- I don't like it.
- Really?

16:10.813 --> 16:11.846
I had no idea.

16:11.897 --> 16:14.682
All right,
no more burrowing.

16:14.734 --> 16:16.284
See, I love
this full disclosure.

16:16.352 --> 16:19.037
Why didn't we make
this agreement earlier?

16:19.121 --> 16:20.521
Well, it's supposed to be about

16:20.573 --> 16:22.190
how we feel
about each other but...

16:22.241 --> 16:23.524
No, it's about everything.

16:23.576 --> 16:26.194
Why?
You holding out on me?

16:26.245 --> 16:28.013
No, no, no,
I'm just clarifying.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.530
It's about trust.

16:29.582 --> 16:32.384
So it's a great game
if two people are playing.

16:38.724 --> 16:43.128
Uh, Doyle Street.
Just turn left here.

17:37.983 --> 17:40.819
Looks like we found
the second thief.

17:40.903 --> 17:43.738
Yeah, and I think
there's a third.

17:43.789 --> 17:45.290
Unless he did that to himself.

18:14.436 --> 18:16.154
These bodies were dissected,

18:16.238 --> 18:17.872
but that's not
what killed them.

18:17.940 --> 18:20.241
It was the high concentration
of osmium in their blood.

18:20.292 --> 18:21.626
They all have toxic levels.

18:21.710 --> 18:23.828
What kind of exposure
would lead to that?

18:25.464 --> 18:27.248
Injection via syringe.

18:27.299 --> 18:28.950
But then why cut up the bodies?

18:29.001 --> 18:31.586
Tissue samples, I suspect.

18:31.637 --> 18:33.454
Looks like an attempt
at an autopsy.

18:33.505 --> 18:35.340
So how could injecting someone

18:35.424 --> 18:37.492
with the world's heaviest
element make them float?

18:37.543 --> 18:39.294
It shouldn't have.

18:39.361 --> 18:41.396
It runs contrary
to the laws of nature.

18:41.463 --> 18:43.130
- So how's that possible?
- I don't know.

18:43.182 --> 18:46.133
Do I look like I have answers?

18:46.185 --> 18:48.353
I have a few.

18:48.437 --> 18:51.573
There are eight
wheelchairs in total.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.942
One of the unis found them.

18:53.993 --> 18:55.827
We I.D.ed
a few of the bodies.

18:55.911 --> 18:57.812
Those men suffered
from muscular dystrophy.

18:57.863 --> 18:59.313
They'd been handicapped
for years.

18:59.365 --> 19:00.982
Of course.

19:01.033 --> 19:05.086
A variation that primarily
affects leg muscles.

19:05.153 --> 19:06.788
Simple.

19:06.839 --> 19:10.291
That's why their chests
and arms were healthy.

19:10.342 --> 19:12.627
The weightlessness didn't
cause the atrophy.

19:12.678 --> 19:15.213
The disease did.
How could I have missed that?

19:15.297 --> 19:16.965
So why target these people?

19:17.016 --> 19:18.633
Does it have something
to do with the disease?

19:18.684 --> 19:20.585
Well, they'd be
eager volunteers.

19:20.653 --> 19:22.604
They were confined
to wheelchairs for years.

19:22.671 --> 19:24.939
How could they pass up
an opportunity to fly?

19:25.007 --> 19:28.142
That's a deal with the devil
nobody would pass up.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.315
Oh! Stu!

19:36.852 --> 19:41.456
- Michael, Michael, heads up.
- Nice.

19:41.523 --> 19:43.357
- Go!
- Oh!

19:43.409 --> 19:46.027
- Go, Michael.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

19:46.078 --> 19:47.662
Yes!

19:47.713 --> 19:50.364
Time, Ref, time.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.750
- Let's go.
- Bring it in, guys.

19:55.137 --> 19:56.387
That was a hell
of a play you made.

19:56.472 --> 19:57.722
I'm impressed.

19:57.806 --> 20:00.925
These newbies don't know
how to play defense.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.510
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

20:02.561 --> 20:04.211
No "d"?
No "d."

20:04.263 --> 20:06.147
- Michael.
- Yeah.

20:06.214 --> 20:07.432
Go get 'em.

20:25.751 --> 20:26.701
Hey.

20:26.752 --> 20:28.703
Tough sport, huh?

20:28.771 --> 20:30.204
Brutal.

20:30.255 --> 20:31.756
Quite a rush.

20:33.592 --> 20:36.044
Why aren't you out there?

20:38.263 --> 20:39.797
Never been
healthy enough to play.

20:43.469 --> 20:46.688
But you wish you could though,
don't you?

20:46.755 --> 20:49.357
I wish a lot of things.

20:49.424 --> 20:51.192
But I stopped believing
in leprechauns and miracles

20:51.259 --> 20:52.710
a long time ago.

20:58.767 --> 21:02.153
What if I told you
I could give you a miracle?

21:13.999 --> 21:15.166
What is it?

21:15.250 --> 21:16.634
Osmium.

21:16.702 --> 21:20.605
From the dead men's blood
in solid form.

21:20.672 --> 21:23.091
I had the morgue send me over
the corpses' blood

21:23.158 --> 21:24.642
so I could isolate it.

21:24.727 --> 21:26.060
Speaking of which,

21:26.128 --> 21:29.597
perhaps you could dispose
of the excess.

21:36.355 --> 21:37.805
I went to Quantico for this?

21:37.856 --> 21:40.141
So all the victims
had different doctors?

21:40.192 --> 21:41.743
And different
insurance carriers.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.161
They must have
something in common

21:43.245 --> 21:44.495
outside their disease,

21:44.580 --> 21:45.913
something that makes them
easy targets

21:45.981 --> 21:48.616
for whoever it is
that's doing this.

21:48.684 --> 21:49.984
You want to get a pizza?

21:50.035 --> 21:51.652
I don't think Regina's
delivers this late.

21:51.703 --> 21:52.670
No, it doesn't.

21:52.755 --> 21:54.288
I was thinking maybe
we could go get it.

21:54.339 --> 21:55.790
You look like
you could use a break,

21:55.841 --> 21:57.125
and I definitely could.

21:57.176 --> 21:58.376
We'll take the files in the car.
Come on.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.928
- I gotta eat, right?
- Excellent.

22:00.996 --> 22:02.830
Hey, guys,
we're going on a pizza run.

22:02.881 --> 22:03.831
You want anything?

22:03.882 --> 22:07.101
Mmm, just some licorice.

22:07.169 --> 22:09.170
I'll get you some
from the machine, Walter.

22:09.221 --> 22:11.606
And no thanks,
I think I just lost my appetite.

22:11.673 --> 22:13.891
Fair enough.
We'll see you in a bit.

22:16.195 --> 22:18.012
This smiling is kinda
freaking me out, right?

22:18.063 --> 22:20.198
Oh, don't look now.

22:23.068 --> 22:24.652
Hello, Nina.

22:24.703 --> 22:26.454
What you doing here?

22:26.521 --> 22:27.855
Oh, I just came by
to drop off a file

22:27.906 --> 22:30.074
that Peter requested
from Massive Dynamic.

22:30.159 --> 22:32.126
But please, do not let go

22:32.194 --> 22:33.961
of a beautiful woman's hand
on my account.

22:34.029 --> 22:36.130
Walter told you, didn't he?

22:36.198 --> 22:37.582
Yes, and he's very pleased,

22:37.666 --> 22:39.050
as am I.

22:39.134 --> 22:40.635
So what's the file about?

22:40.702 --> 22:42.720
I'm just doing some research
on shape-shifters.

22:42.805 --> 22:44.922
Oh, I didn't realize.
Anything in particular?

22:45.007 --> 22:46.924
No, just background.

22:47.009 --> 22:48.476
It's Broyles.
I'll be right back.

22:48.543 --> 22:51.062
Dunham.

22:51.146 --> 22:52.563
I must say,
I think you have made

22:52.648 --> 22:56.100
a very wise decision
to go forward.

22:56.185 --> 23:00.605
You deserve to be happy.
Both of you.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.248
No, no, no,
this is simply not possible!

23:10.332 --> 23:12.250
Well, I got more bad news.

23:12.334 --> 23:13.868
They're out of licorice.

23:13.919 --> 23:15.586
But I got you some mints.

23:18.573 --> 23:21.209
Whoever enabled
these people to float

23:21.260 --> 23:24.345
is altering the basic
properties of osmium,

23:24.412 --> 23:28.299
making the heaviest
element lighter than air.

23:28.383 --> 23:30.268
He's defied physics.

23:30.352 --> 23:32.520
Our entire universe

23:32.587 --> 23:36.023
exists in a delicate state
of equilibrium, hmm?

23:36.091 --> 23:39.426
And we know what happens
if that balance is upset.

23:39.478 --> 23:41.262
It could cause
a chain reaction.

23:41.313 --> 23:45.233
He's messing with the
fundamental constants of our world!

23:45.284 --> 23:46.951
It could lead to chaos.

23:47.035 --> 23:48.536
Ahh!

23:48.603 --> 23:51.622
Walter!

23:51.707 --> 23:55.109
I don't imagine you're
preparing for a science fair.

23:58.630 --> 24:02.800
- I'll get a mop.
- No, I'll get a mop.

24:02.885 --> 24:04.802
Good to see you, Astrid.

24:08.724 --> 24:10.975
Walter, what is it?

24:11.043 --> 24:13.377
I need Belly.
I need his help.

24:13.445 --> 24:14.562
I can't do this alone.

24:14.629 --> 24:18.015
This case, Peter...
I'm failing, Nina.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.133
Walter...

24:19.184 --> 24:21.986
I know he's dead, I know that.

24:22.070 --> 24:25.439
But maybe we can
bring him back.

24:25.490 --> 24:27.808
Look, one of his
research projects.

24:29.644 --> 24:33.698
He posits here
that a person's soul

24:33.782 --> 24:35.116
or consciousness

24:35.167 --> 24:37.118
continues to live on
after death.

24:37.169 --> 24:40.504
And all it needs is a vessel
or a host to return to.

24:40.589 --> 24:42.456
Yes, I remember.

24:42.507 --> 24:44.425
It was one of William's more
extreme flights of fancy.

24:44.492 --> 24:47.061
All he'd need to do
was to prepare someone

24:47.129 --> 24:51.299
by inserting a microscopic
soul magnet inside them.

24:51.350 --> 24:53.801
And he proposes using
injections, food,

24:53.869 --> 24:55.002
- or a cup of tea...
- Walter...

24:55.053 --> 24:56.837
What if he did it?
What if he's done it?

24:56.888 --> 24:59.023
What if he's done it, Nina?
What if he's done it?

24:59.107 --> 25:01.192
Then all we have to do
is to figure out

25:01.276 --> 25:03.527
how to trigger the magnets
to summon the soul

25:03.612 --> 25:04.812
back into the host,

25:04.863 --> 25:08.515
and he'll be back here with us.

25:13.805 --> 25:17.074
He cut out parts
of my brain, Nina.

25:17.159 --> 25:18.876
I don't think I'm capable.

25:18.961 --> 25:22.129
Walter, it was never
your intellect

25:22.197 --> 25:24.548
that made you exceptional.

25:24.633 --> 25:26.250
You're brilliant, of course.

25:26.335 --> 25:28.252
But it was your imagination,

25:28.337 --> 25:32.373
your boundless creativity.

25:32.424 --> 25:35.926
Yes, you're not
quite whole, Walter.

25:36.011 --> 25:37.678
But the best parts
of you remain.

25:37.729 --> 25:39.847
So focus on that.

25:42.484 --> 25:43.934
What if I fail?

25:44.019 --> 25:45.987
You won't fail, Walter.

25:46.054 --> 25:49.890
How can you be so sure?

25:52.611 --> 25:54.895
Because you can't.

26:16.430 --> 26:18.514
All right, just like that.

26:32.813 --> 26:36.649
There. All done.

26:38.318 --> 26:40.886
- That's it?
- Yeah.

26:44.441 --> 26:46.242
I don't feel anything.

26:48.428 --> 26:50.663
Are you su...

26:54.968 --> 26:57.136
Oh, my God!

27:01.608 --> 27:03.559
Oh, my God!

27:03.626 --> 27:05.428
Good. You're standing.

27:05.479 --> 27:06.962
Now walk.

27:07.013 --> 27:08.681
Go on.
You can do it.

27:08.765 --> 27:10.966
I can walk.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.906
You can do much more
than that, Vince.

27:16.973 --> 27:19.608
Oh, my God!

27:21.745 --> 27:26.282
- This is amazing!
- Easy, easy, easy.

27:26.333 --> 27:27.533
Oh... Okay.

27:27.617 --> 27:29.919
You'll have plenty of time
for that later.

27:32.706 --> 27:35.091
Okay... Okay.

27:35.158 --> 27:37.042
What are you, about a size 12?

27:37.127 --> 27:39.962
- Yeah, why?
- Here.

27:40.013 --> 27:41.714
These'll keep you grounded.

27:41.798 --> 27:43.299
It's very important
that you wear these

27:43.350 --> 27:45.351
when you're outside.

27:45.435 --> 27:47.269
Without a tether,
you'll just keep floating up

27:47.337 --> 27:50.022
into the atmosphere.

27:50.107 --> 27:51.724
I don't know how to thank you.

27:51.808 --> 27:54.860
You don't have to.

27:54.945 --> 27:58.314
I just wish I had enough
to make it permanent.

27:58.365 --> 28:01.817
Unfortunately, that was
the last of my treatments.

28:01.868 --> 28:05.154
I don't have the stuff I need
to make another batch.

28:06.656 --> 28:08.073
How do we get more?

28:13.580 --> 28:18.134
Nina was right.
I just had to get creative.

28:18.201 --> 28:20.469
Walter, how is liquid nitrogen
melting metal?

28:20.537 --> 28:23.088
Whoever's doing this has
reversed the laws of physics.

28:23.156 --> 28:26.509
Up is down.
Left is right.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.977
And hot is cold.

28:28.044 --> 28:31.547
So cold temperatures will
melt the element instead of heat.

28:31.598 --> 28:33.382
Correct, my dear.

28:36.837 --> 28:39.388
What's that white stuff?

28:39.439 --> 28:43.725
It appears... the osmium was
mixed with another element.

28:43.777 --> 28:46.362
A mystery element.

28:46.413 --> 28:48.864
Call Peter and Olivia.

28:48.915 --> 28:51.333
Tell them to come right over.

28:51.401 --> 28:53.619
We have something to show them.

29:00.743 --> 29:02.211
- Ready, Michael?
- Right.

29:05.415 --> 29:07.132
- Ohh...
- Thank you.

29:07.217 --> 29:09.718
And one...

29:09.769 --> 29:11.804
Two.

29:15.692 --> 29:17.393
You going somewhere, Dad?

29:17.444 --> 29:20.229
Oh, I've got some work
to do back at the office.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.481
It's nearly midnight.

29:22.566 --> 29:26.068
It's just this new project.

29:26.119 --> 29:28.070
It is keeping me busy.

29:28.121 --> 29:30.656
You push yourself
too hard, Dad.

29:30.724 --> 29:32.625
Yeah.

29:38.415 --> 29:42.451
I'm close to something big,
Michael.

29:44.621 --> 29:48.173
A breakthrough
that'll change everything.

29:48.258 --> 29:50.509
Change lives.

29:52.312 --> 29:55.464
But the answer
is just out of my reach.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.433
You'll get there, Dad.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.852
I know you will.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.770
You've never failed before.

30:01.838 --> 30:03.739
You won't fail this time.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.282
- Good night, kiddo.
- Night, Dad.

30:16.586 --> 30:18.921
- Michael.
- Yeah.

30:22.309 --> 30:24.460
See you in the morning.

30:26.296 --> 30:28.764
Lutetium.
It was mixed with the osmium.

30:28.831 --> 30:30.933
Lutetium is dense, Walter.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.102
Extremely dense,
just like osmium.

30:33.169 --> 30:35.471
Correct. Two shouldn't even
be able to form a molecule,

30:35.522 --> 30:39.108
let alone one that would
make a human being float.

30:39.175 --> 30:41.843
So Walter, is this other
element as rare as the osmium?

30:41.895 --> 30:44.146
- Yes. Very rare.
- What are you thinking?

30:44.197 --> 30:46.198
Well, if it's rare, then he's
probably got a limited supply.

30:46.266 --> 30:47.983
Meaning he's gonna
have to get some more.

30:48.034 --> 30:49.318
So Walter,
whereabouts in Boston

30:49.369 --> 30:51.654
would he be able
to acquire lutetium?

30:51.721 --> 30:54.123
It's mainly found
in meteorites.

30:54.190 --> 30:57.626
Do you think the perpetrator's
from outer space?

30:57.694 --> 30:59.728
Um, probably not.

30:59.796 --> 31:01.297
Where do you think we could
find it on Earth, Walter?

31:01.364 --> 31:03.299
Well, he'd need
several samples,

31:03.366 --> 31:05.834
so somewhere where there's
an abundance of meteorites.

31:05.885 --> 31:07.553
The Museum of Science.

31:07.637 --> 31:10.172
The Museum of Science has
an excellent astronomy wing.

31:10.223 --> 31:11.557
I'm gonna call Broyles.

32:11.267 --> 32:12.618
Whoa-oa-oa!

32:28.284 --> 32:30.969
BPD's sending a unit
to sit on the museum.

32:31.054 --> 32:32.120
Good. How's security?

32:32.172 --> 32:33.305
According to the curator,

32:33.390 --> 32:34.640
there's a night watchman
on duty,

32:34.724 --> 32:37.226
and all the wings are individually
locked from the inside.

32:37.293 --> 32:38.394
Seems pretty solid.

32:39.962 --> 32:42.765
Not solid enough.

33:01.984 --> 33:04.036
You sure you disabled
the alarm?

33:04.120 --> 33:05.370
I did exactly what you told me.

33:05.455 --> 33:08.707
- The way we practiced.
- Come on.

33:08.792 --> 33:10.626
We don't have much time.

33:10.677 --> 33:12.511
If we were being robbed,
I'd know.

33:12.595 --> 33:14.513
We got cameras
on all the doors.

33:14.597 --> 33:16.632
They didn't come in
through the doors.

33:18.668 --> 33:20.636
You almost done?

33:20.687 --> 33:22.020
Almost.

33:31.815 --> 33:33.515
Somebody's coming.

33:36.703 --> 33:38.904
Well, hurry up!

33:38.988 --> 33:40.456
Get that door open now!

33:40.523 --> 33:41.957
Come on!

33:45.295 --> 33:47.296
- Let's go!
- Wait, you can't just leave me!

33:47.363 --> 33:48.297
I need your help!

34:04.681 --> 34:06.482
Stop!

34:10.320 --> 34:11.436
Turn around.

34:17.443 --> 34:18.694
Help me!

34:18.745 --> 34:19.995
It's slipping.

34:20.062 --> 34:21.530
I can't hold on!

35:08.196 --> 35:11.231
Dad, nobody will tell me
what is going on.

35:18.323 --> 35:20.874
I hurt some people, Michael.

35:22.827 --> 35:24.611
- What...
- I was trying to help them.

35:24.662 --> 35:26.947
I wanted to fix them.

35:26.998 --> 35:28.599
They were in wheelchairs,
like you.

35:30.818 --> 35:33.637
I know I should have
told you sooner.

35:33.721 --> 35:36.106
Maybe if I had,
it never would have come to this.

35:36.174 --> 35:38.942
I did it for you, Michael.

35:41.896 --> 35:44.948
When it was perfected,
I was gonna give it to you.

35:48.236 --> 35:51.171
Is that how you see me?

35:51.239 --> 35:52.990
As something
that you need to fix?

35:53.074 --> 35:54.858
No, no.

35:54.943 --> 35:55.909
No.

35:55.977 --> 35:57.911
Of course not.

35:57.979 --> 36:01.498
I just wanted you to be happy.

36:01.582 --> 36:03.834
I was happy.

36:03.918 --> 36:05.652
I went to bed at night

36:05.703 --> 36:07.838
knowing I had a father
who loved me.

36:20.001 --> 36:23.603
Michael.

36:26.474 --> 36:27.674
Michael.

36:32.363 --> 36:34.681
Daedalus crafted wings
for his son Icarus

36:34.732 --> 36:36.316
so he could fly away.

36:36.367 --> 36:39.536
So that he could be free.

36:39.620 --> 36:43.890
The wings he gave him
wound up killing his son.

36:43.958 --> 36:47.344
I suppose that makes me
a lucky man then.

36:49.180 --> 36:51.348
Other parents
weren't so fortunate.

36:54.419 --> 36:56.753
I need to know
how you did it.

36:56.821 --> 37:00.640
How did you defy
the laws of physics?

37:09.400 --> 37:10.917
I work in aeronautics.

37:10.985 --> 37:13.770
A few months ago,
I was contracted

37:13.855 --> 37:17.741
to develop a new alloy
for military aircraft...

37:17.825 --> 37:19.192
A metal dense enough

37:19.243 --> 37:21.161
to keep pilots safe
from ground fire

37:21.228 --> 37:22.746
but still allow for flight.

37:22.830 --> 37:26.516
I wasn't having much success.

37:27.752 --> 37:30.537
And then I combined
two elements.

37:30.605 --> 37:33.824
- Rare elements.
- Osmium and lutetium.

37:33.891 --> 37:35.642
And that's when it happened.

37:35.710 --> 37:39.012
I'd combined two of the densest
elements on earth,

37:39.080 --> 37:42.248
and somehow the result
was a new molecule...

37:42.300 --> 37:45.118
A molecule lighter than air.

37:45.186 --> 37:47.888
- And that's it?
- It should never have worked.

37:47.939 --> 37:52.192
It was an accident.

37:52.259 --> 37:53.944
A miracle.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.831
Oh. Walter.

38:16.651 --> 38:19.086
- I know what made the men float.
- Oh, yes.

38:19.137 --> 38:20.954
I heard that an arrest
had been made.

38:21.005 --> 38:23.173
You found the man
responsible, I take it.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.641
There is a man in custody,

38:24.725 --> 38:29.262
but Dr. Krick is not
the man responsible.

38:29.313 --> 38:31.731
I am.

38:31.799 --> 38:35.902
Dr. Krick's serum
should never have worked.

38:35.970 --> 38:39.072
This man wasn't changing
the fundamental laws of nature.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.908
I think they were
changing on their own.

38:41.976 --> 38:44.244
I think he took
advantage of it.

38:44.311 --> 38:46.196
Don't you see, Nina?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.981
Our universe
is starting to break down

38:48.032 --> 38:50.834
because of what I did
twenty-five years ago.

38:50.918 --> 38:52.869
What we've seen happening
on the other side

38:52.954 --> 38:55.338
is starting to happen here!

38:55.406 --> 38:58.125
Well, you seem to be taking
the news rather well.

38:58.176 --> 39:02.129
Because I finally
figured out how to stop it.

39:06.551 --> 39:09.136
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:10.605 --> 39:11.855
Thanks for meeting me.

39:11.939 --> 39:14.774
Is this why you asked me
to meet you across campus

39:14.842 --> 39:16.693
and not at the lab...
So that we could make out

39:16.777 --> 39:18.862
in front of college kids
and not your dad?

39:18.946 --> 39:20.981
No. Not exactly.

39:21.032 --> 39:23.233
I haven't been entirely
honest with you.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.534
Oh?

39:24.619 --> 39:26.820
Whatever's happening
between the two universes,

39:26.871 --> 39:28.371
whatever our fate is,

39:28.456 --> 39:30.290
I'm right at the center of it.

39:30.357 --> 39:32.576
Peter, I mean,
we're all there for you.

39:32.660 --> 39:35.495
We're all working together
to figure this out.

39:35.546 --> 39:37.197
Look, I know that you're
all trying to help,

39:37.248 --> 39:40.000
but it's not your face
in that drawing.

39:40.051 --> 39:41.835
- It's mine.
- So what are you saying?

39:43.554 --> 39:45.889
I've been working
on something for a while now.

39:45.973 --> 39:47.924
Something that I didn't want
to tell anybody about

39:48.009 --> 39:49.643
because, frankly,
I can't trust the FBI,

39:49.710 --> 39:51.511
and as much as I know
Walter cares...

39:51.562 --> 39:53.480
He's too protective.

39:53.547 --> 39:55.899
I... I can't trust
his judgment.

39:55.983 --> 39:57.717
But I do trust yours.

39:59.987 --> 40:01.605
But I don't want there to be
any more secrets

40:01.672 --> 40:03.556
between the two of us.

40:03.608 --> 40:05.408
So full disclosure.

40:11.415 --> 40:13.366
"Soul magnets."

40:13.417 --> 40:15.752
Oh, Walter, I thought
we already talked about this.

40:15.836 --> 40:18.171
William is gone.
You can't bring him back.

40:18.239 --> 40:20.373
Maybe I can.

40:20.424 --> 40:21.791
Belly's notes are incomplete,

40:21.876 --> 40:25.195
but I think I was right
about the trigger.

40:25.263 --> 40:27.464
I think there is an instrument

40:27.548 --> 40:29.799
that can draw Belly's
consciousness

40:29.884 --> 40:32.219
out of its new vessel.

40:34.255 --> 40:36.640
- Walter, what are you doing?
- And I think...

40:36.724 --> 40:40.026
Belly would have left it
with someone he trusted.

40:41.595 --> 40:43.446
No. You can't be serious.

40:45.950 --> 40:47.934
A person's consciousness...

40:47.985 --> 40:50.620
Their soul is energy.

40:50.705 --> 40:54.040
And energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

40:54.108 --> 40:56.743
No matter where
Belly's consciousness is,

40:56.794 --> 40:59.796
the harmonic vibrations
emanating from this bell

40:59.880 --> 41:02.949
will draw it forth from whatever
vessel he chose before...

41:03.000 --> 41:04.801
Walter, you're being...

41:13.261 --> 41:14.527
Belly?

41:15.813 --> 41:17.781
No, Walter.
It's still me.

41:17.848 --> 41:20.016
Mm. Of course.

41:20.084 --> 41:22.135
Well...

41:22.186 --> 41:24.571
- What now?
- If I'm right...

41:24.638 --> 41:27.691
Wherever Belly is...

41:27.775 --> 41:30.393
He will find us.

41:44.709 --> 41:47.660
It's everything we know
about the machine,

41:47.712 --> 41:49.179
every schematic,
every piece of data,

41:49.263 --> 41:51.164
every diagnostic.

41:57.004 --> 41:58.355
Are these...

41:58.439 --> 42:00.056
Memory disks from dead
shape-shifters. Yeah.

42:00.141 --> 42:02.642
Well, how did you get them?

42:10.985 --> 42:12.736
They're still working.

42:12.820 --> 42:15.622
The information on them's
encrypted, though.

42:15.689 --> 42:17.707
I thought maybe Astrid
could figure it out,

42:17.792 --> 42:20.026
but I didn't want
to bring her into this.

42:21.996 --> 42:23.330
I've run it through

42:23.381 --> 42:25.065
every code-breaking
program that I know,

42:25.132 --> 42:27.250
but so far I can't break it.

42:27.318 --> 42:32.939
That's because the decoder key
is in my office.
