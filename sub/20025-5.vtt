WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.441 --> 00:13.046
Six years ago, the Geordie Squad
first got together.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.483
(cheering)

00:16.549 --> 00:18.451
But it's not all been one big party.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.453
Back to work.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.189
We've had to work
for that wrinkly fuck Anna.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.527
But we fucking nailed it.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.596
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:32.031 --> 00:35.001
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.406
So, now the squad is expanding.

00:39.472 --> 00:42.609
Oi, oi!
Hello! Hiya!

00:42.675 --> 00:44.878
Cheers!
(cheering)

00:50.183 --> 00:54.053
I'm not gonna be able to
keep all yous all on full time.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.792
We need to help Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

01:01.027 --> 01:03.329
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:03.396 --> 01:06.099
Are they fucking radge enough...

01:06.166 --> 01:08.868
To join this crazy family?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.576
Let wuh fuckin gan.

01:17.343 --> 01:22.081
So far, Anna has sent Abbie, Zahida,
Sarah, Elettra, Eve, Billy and Sam

01:22.148 --> 01:24.684
for us to put through their paces.
(laughs)

01:24.751 --> 01:26.519
Team sausage!

01:26.586 --> 01:28.988
Are you single?
Seven years strong. Woo!

01:29.055 --> 01:31.324
What was that?
I just felt my fanny flutter.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.359
(cheering)

01:34.227 --> 01:35.795
I kissed the new boy.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.133
I wanna party!

01:41.768 --> 01:44.871
I do have a boyfriend, but I
still wanna have fun with Aaron!

01:47.907 --> 01:51.678
As much as I'd like to have sex in
that shag pad, I care about Marnie.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.880
I won't pull girls
in front of her face.

01:55.915 --> 01:58.985
Night after night, I have to
watch him and Elettra neck on.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.054
It's getting too much now.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.689
Surely tonight's the night!

02:04.157 --> 02:06.759
Am I ever gonna get past
necking on with Elettra?

02:10.128 --> 02:12.532
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.400
Never kiss without a six pack.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.136
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.572
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.708
I'm preened to perfection.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.077
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.946
I'm cheeky, colourful,
full of mischief.

02:27.013 --> 02:29.883
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:29.949 --> 02:33.486
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.089
(all) Geordie Shore, Why-aye!

02:45.632 --> 02:46.833
(groans)

02:54.507 --> 02:58.678
Chloe, you got upset over Elettra.
I know.

02:59.879 --> 03:03.983
Elettra and Marty were all over each
other and he doesn't give a shit.

03:04.050 --> 03:08.187
Nobody would want to see someone
they like getting with another girl.

03:08.254 --> 03:13.092
It must be so hard for Chloe,
seeing Marty get with Elettra

03:13.159 --> 03:15.962
but she's been so strong
and stayed away from him.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.197
You didn't get violent,
which is good.

03:18.264 --> 03:22.201
I feel like you are starting to
distance yourself from Martin. I am.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.137
Is Sam your rebound?

03:24.203 --> 03:26.039
I do like Sam, he's a nice lad,

03:26.105 --> 03:30.009
but I want to concentrate on
getting over Marty before I move on.

03:37.917 --> 03:42.221
I've spent two nights in Elettra's
bed now, and I finally got...

03:42.288 --> 03:43.289
nowhere!

03:43.356 --> 03:47.160
Nice to have you back. I'm starting
to forget what you look like.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.829
What actually happened?
Cuddled and kissed.

03:49.896 --> 03:54.467
(laughs) A little fondle, play with
my willy for two and a half seconds.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.171
I think Marty, deep down, knows that
Elettra is stringing him along,

03:58.237 --> 04:02.442
but every time she shakes her
little arse, he can't resist!

04:02.508 --> 04:06.145
Anna can't put any more people in
here. It's like a fucking hotel!

04:06.212 --> 04:09.382
People are coming and going.
I feel like we're reception.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.484
"Welcome to the
Geordie Shore hotel."

04:11.551 --> 04:14.187
Anna has never given us
so much responsibility.

04:14.253 --> 04:17.724
We're helping her decide who stays,
and I'm fucking loving it.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.293
Right, we've got you.
(laughs)

04:26.032 --> 04:28.034
(phone rings)

04:30.136 --> 04:31.738
It's the phone again.

04:31.804 --> 04:36.309
Please, Anna, don't say that I have
to work in the cold another time.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.343
Hello.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.716
Anna's got another job
for the new workers.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.486
Another chance to teach them
how to blag like fuck

04:46.552 --> 04:48.588
and pretend we know
what we're doing.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.997
Me and Gaz can sit back,
relax, chill

04:58.064 --> 05:00.400
and watch the newbies
do all the work.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.169
Right, me and Gaz
are taking all the newbies

05:03.236 --> 05:05.705
on an open-top bus tour
around the town.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.974
Oh! Come on.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.410
So, newbies, you will
have to be up for it.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.126
Oi, oi!
(all exclaim)

05:30.563 --> 05:34.100
It's one of my mates Chelsea,
and I'm fucking buzzing to see her.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.668
Hello.
You all right?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.970
I'm Chelsea, I'm 24, I'm single,

05:38.037 --> 05:41.240
and I'm looking for a man
to sweep us off my feet.

05:41.307 --> 05:43.843
Banter bus is here!

05:46.479 --> 05:49.348
I know I haven't pulled yet,
but this could be the girl

05:49.415 --> 05:52.618
to get me over my Marnie issues.
She is fit as fuck.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.922
Straight away, we're going
to work today, you're coming.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.891
Me, Aaron and all the newbies.
It's amazing to be here,

05:58.958 --> 06:02.228
but Anna's told me she's
trying out loads of new workers

06:02.295 --> 06:03.529
and this place is full!

06:03.596 --> 06:05.598
I guess I'm gonna
have to play catch up

06:05.665 --> 06:09.035
and the pressure's on
to make a big first impression.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.908
I'm so happy to do a tour,
but not in a bus.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.010
Maybe in a limousine with a blanket.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.679
(laughs)

06:22.749 --> 06:24.150
To the bus!

06:28.554 --> 06:31.691
Thing is, I know Chelsea,
we've been friends a long time.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.826
Is she loud?
She's one of my best mates!

06:33.893 --> 06:38.464
One of my ex boyfriends,
she shagged him after a week.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.099
I wouldn't trust her, then.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.302
Marnie can still be friends
with someone who banged her ex.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.271
I wouldn't go near her!

06:54.480 --> 06:56.482
All aboard!
The party bus!

06:58.084 --> 07:01.654
Today at work is a tough one.
On an open top bus, freezing cold,

07:01.721 --> 07:04.824
and you've got to get people excited
and happy to be there,

07:04.891 --> 07:07.326
while giving them a tour
of Newcastle.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.229
Right, who wants the mega,
mega, mega, megaphone?

07:10.296 --> 07:12.965
There's Newcastle city centre,
everyone go radge

07:13.032 --> 07:16.636
and put your hands in the air
and go berserk. (cheering)

07:17.303 --> 07:21.574
Hello, everyone. I'm Chelsea.
On wuh right, St James' park.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.443
Who supports the Toon?
Toon black and white army!

07:25.478 --> 07:27.180
(cheering)
Woo!

07:27.246 --> 07:28.948
Mamma Mia!

07:29.015 --> 07:31.050
Ciao, ciao, Newcastle.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.687
These are traffic lights.
Red means stop.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.889
Amber means hesitate.
Green means go.

07:40.526 --> 07:43.062
Make some noise if you're cold.
(cheering)

07:43.129 --> 07:45.932
It is fucking freezing on this bus,

07:45.998 --> 07:49.602
and Sam, Abbie, Sarah and Zahida
haven't really had a chance to work,

07:49.669 --> 07:53.639
so I'm gonna move this Georday tours
somewhere more familiar, a bar.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.385
Right, don't you dare fart.
Never.

08:06.452 --> 08:09.655
Me and Marnie are not only cousins,
we're very close.

08:09.722 --> 08:13.893
And Marnie is even that close,
she can bleach my bumhole.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.294
Oh, my God!
Is it burning?

08:15.361 --> 08:17.797
No. Oh, it tickles so much!

08:17.864 --> 08:19.131
Fuck me.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.767
Ooh.
What do you mean, "ooh"?

08:21.834 --> 08:25.304
That is the most beautiful arsehole
I've ever seen now.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.341
I think I'm really good at this
bumhole bleaching crack.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.644
I'll have to tell Anna,
and she can sell my services.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.448
I want you to be honest,
do you think it's improved?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.951
Looks like a baboon.
(laughs)

08:41.754 --> 08:43.688
Come on, lets go, go, go, go, go, go.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.661
For the second half of work, the bus
driver has managed to find a bar

08:48.728 --> 08:51.864
that's going to let us work in there,
lucky for me and Aaron,

08:51.931 --> 08:54.100
the newbies are doing the graft.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.702
We came off the bus
cos it was fucking freezing.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.939
We need to come up with some games.
Normally we're prepared,

09:00.006 --> 09:02.174
but we haven't got anything to use

09:02.241 --> 09:04.277
Spin the brolly. Got me own brolly

09:04.343 --> 09:06.178
Time for me and Sam to step up.

09:06.245 --> 09:10.216
Get everybody standing in a nice
semi-circle, please, right now.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.218
Spin the umbrella, kiss or dare.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.754
Perfect for me,
cos I fucking love necking on.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.156
Kiss.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.893
That's gotta be good enough, Anna.
Keeping the clients happy.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.795
(cheering)

09:27.166 --> 09:28.467
I'll kiss a bird.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.372
Sam suddenly jumped in on my kiss.

09:33.439 --> 09:36.442
What are yous doing?
That bird's mine, not yours.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.210
Your face in her tits.

09:38.277 --> 09:41.414
Start your engine, lads.
Let's get motor-boating.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.650
(cheering)

09:44.717 --> 09:47.820
Sam and Zahida spinning it,
people are necking on.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.389
All I want is Aaron
to get over Marnie.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.760
And I dare Aaron
to neck on with Chelsea.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.063
Gaz has set up for me
to neck on with Aaron.

09:57.129 --> 10:00.800
I am thinking about Marnie, but I
also want to make a big impression.

10:00.866 --> 10:04.003
if I back out now,
I'm gonna look like a right loser.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.874
(cheering)

10:11.010 --> 10:15.348
Wow. Not only is Aaron really fit,
he's also a wicked neck on.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.652
Wingman strikes again. (laughs)

10:19.719 --> 10:20.886
Thanks, Gary.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.891
Today was a test
and Chelsea done well.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.328
Now that's done, let's get back,
get ready, hit the Toon hard.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.631
And hopefully I'll be cracking on
to Chelsea even harder.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.777
# I love to shave #

10:44.844 --> 10:48.214
Everyone's buzzing for tonight.
We've got a new girl, Chelsea.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.716
Time to show her
how we party Geordie style.

10:56.722 --> 10:59.125
Tonight, I'll neck on
with Chelsea all night.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.626
All night.
All night.

11:00.693 --> 11:03.229
Then where are you goin'?
To the shag pad.

11:03.295 --> 11:06.332
Chelsea has made the blood pump
back around my chopper,

11:06.399 --> 11:07.733
which I forgot existed.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.935
Marnie said it's OK if I pull
anyone,

11:10.002 --> 11:12.371
so Chelsea is going to
feel the full force

11:12.438 --> 11:14.907
of the Aaron Chalmers
charming experience.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.743
I want to kiss Chelsea's fanny.
Ooh!

11:25.284 --> 11:28.621
Tonight, we need to be family,
stick together, no aggs.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.789
Yes?
(all) Yes.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.224
(all cheer)

11:32.291 --> 11:33.392
Into the taxi!

11:39.331 --> 11:42.935
Tonight is wicked.
We're dancing like no-one cares.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.309
(all shouting)

11:50.876 --> 11:53.546
What the fuck? Someone
hoyed a nugget off me face!

11:55.314 --> 11:57.883
Best first night ever.
(screams)

12:02.988 --> 12:03.189
.

12:05.724 --> 12:05.925
.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.607
Tonight,
I've only got one thing on my mind,

12:21.674 --> 12:25.211
and that's getting with Chelsea.
And nothing is gonna stop us.

12:27.646 --> 12:30.850
We're in the club
and I'm buzzing for my first night.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.320
Who knows what could happen
with me and Aaron, wait and see.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.288
To Chelsea!

12:43.963 --> 12:46.265
I'm watching Sam
do his best dance moves

12:46.332 --> 12:49.602
and fuck me, I'm dripping wet
and I can't help it.

12:49.668 --> 12:51.170
Come here you, sexy bitch.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.093
I see Chloe's necking on
with Sam again.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.630
That means I'm free to put some
serious graft in with Elettra.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.968
Come here,
my little pesto pasta shell.

13:39.385 --> 13:44.123
The way that Chloe dances is
the most unfuckable in the world,

13:44.190 --> 13:46.892
but I like her, I want to kiss her.

13:54.366 --> 13:57.203
Elettra doesn't realise
what she's doing,

13:57.269 --> 13:59.605
but Chloe does.
She's trying to wind us up.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.474
Why can't we just have
a normal fucking night?

14:16.055 --> 14:19.158
Marty say to me,
"You cannot kiss Chloe."

14:19.225 --> 14:24.530
I mean, baby, who are you to tell me
what I have or not have to do.

14:29.635 --> 14:33.138
I just wish I could speak Italian,
so I could tell Elettra

14:33.205 --> 14:34.707
not to kiss Chloe,

14:34.773 --> 14:38.077
but I don't think she understands
what I'm fucking saying!

14:54.727 --> 14:57.930
I know Marnie better than anyone.
She said she wouldn't mind

14:57.997 --> 15:01.300
if I pull other girls, but if I
was to do it in front of her face,

15:01.367 --> 15:03.202
she would fucking hit the roof.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.243
I can't help being
really attracted to Aaron,

15:11.310 --> 15:14.613
but Marnie might have a problem
with me and him getting close.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.350
It's only me first night, and I
already feel stuck in the middle.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.695
Marnie's been watching
Chelsea and Aaron like a hawk,

15:29.762 --> 15:32.765
even though she's got a
boyfriend now and she's moved on.

15:32.831 --> 15:37.670
If she sees Aaron get with Chelsea,
that is gonna hurt real bad.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.849
I thought that me and Aaron
were in a good place,

15:50.916 --> 15:53.485
but now Chelsea's here,
it's like I don't exist.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.555
I need to speak to Chelsea
and see what's going on.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.412
I hope that Chelsea does
like Aaron and he likes her,

16:20.479 --> 16:23.549
cos it's risking the friendship
with both of them.

16:30.255 --> 16:33.425
I know I've just gotta be
the bigger person, be mature,

16:33.492 --> 16:36.362
be understanding,
but really all I can think is,

16:36.428 --> 16:38.764
what the fuck are you
playing at, Chelsea?

16:49.575 --> 16:52.811
This is mint.
Marnie's being so understanding.

16:52.878 --> 16:56.448
I haven't stepped on anyone's toes
and I'm getting the green light

16:56.515 --> 16:59.551
to crack on with a lad
that I really fancy. Win, win!

17:05.089 --> 17:08.660
Tonight is wicked.
We're dancing like no-one cares.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.363
It makes me want to stay
with this lot forever.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.705
Me and Gary do have
a big role in this house.

17:20.772 --> 17:24.643
He's, like, looking after the boys
all the time, he's like a wise owl.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.046
I'm like the silverback gorilla,
looking after all the girls.

17:42.361 --> 17:45.063
This is one of the best nights out
we've had so far.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.734
The energy was insane,
but now it's time to get home.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.847
(shouting, cheering)

18:03.849 --> 18:06.452
We're back at the house
and we're all shit-faced

18:06.518 --> 18:09.388
and we don't want the party
to stop yet.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.290
We're standing next to each other.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.260
(screams)

18:15.327 --> 18:17.129
(laughs)

18:17.196 --> 18:21.533
Not me. No me. Aaron, you do realise
everyone is throwing food at us?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.735
Someone hit me in the face
with a nugget.

18:23.802 --> 18:27.139
There's no way I'm having that.
Return of the food fight.

18:27.206 --> 18:30.576
Oh! You little fucking shit-heads!

18:33.479 --> 18:35.447
Come on, then!

18:35.514 --> 18:36.849
(laughter)

18:36.915 --> 18:39.852
The floor is so dirty,
I can't stand up.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.490
Chelsea, I'm sorry,
I'm taking you down with me.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.325
Ow, me head!

18:46.391 --> 18:49.228
Cheers, Nathan,
way to take a man down with you.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.336
I've got cum on my face!
I got jizz on my face.

18:57.402 --> 19:01.106
This is why this house is so
fucked up, we're having a food fight

19:01.173 --> 19:03.775
and there's people hiding
behind an umbrella.

19:03.842 --> 19:06.778
Nathan's behind the cooker,
people are stacking it.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.448
I wouldn't change this house
for the world.

19:10.549 --> 19:14.219
Chicken nugget grenade!
Chicken nugget grenade! Ow!

19:14.286 --> 19:15.921
Ah! What the fuck, man?

19:15.988 --> 19:20.259
Someone's just hoyed a nugget off me
face and it's popped me fucking lip!

19:20.325 --> 19:22.828
Are you all right? Are you hurt?
Is it bleeding?

19:22.895 --> 19:25.731
A little bit, yeah.
Zahida, me fucking face!

19:27.533 --> 19:29.268
I pay a lot of money for this moy,

19:29.334 --> 19:32.170
and someone's just gonna
fuck it up like that? Ooh!

19:34.239 --> 19:37.509
Someone just threw a chicken nugget
really hard at my face.

19:37.576 --> 19:43.181
(laughs)
Me fillers are double the size!

19:43.248 --> 19:46.385
I'm trying to keep a straight face,
but howay, man, Sarah.

19:46.451 --> 19:50.088
You only got hit in the nugget
with a nugget. Man up, mate!

19:50.155 --> 19:53.091
Is she crying cos a chicken nugget
hit her in the head?

19:53.158 --> 19:56.895
A chicken nugget hit her in the lip.
It was hard!

20:01.333 --> 20:03.268
Chelsea, come and have a chat.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.541
Me and Chelsea have been getting
closer all day and night,

20:09.608 --> 20:13.211
so it's only right that I show her
to her room. I'm a proper gent, me.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.650
I've had an absolutely unreal night,

20:18.717 --> 20:22.020
but I'm not gonna lie, ending it
with Aaron has topped it off.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.957
You said, "We'll not
neck on in front of Marnie."

20:25.023 --> 20:28.126
Me and Chelsea didn't neck on
in the club out of respect,

20:28.193 --> 20:30.062
so I'm gonna make up for lost time.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.563
So, Marnie's not here.

20:47.145 --> 20:50.382
I've decided that Sam can
spoon me tonight, but that's it.

20:50.449 --> 20:54.386
If he wants some hanky panky,
then he needs to work a lot harder.

20:55.787 --> 20:59.524
Aaron's got into bed with Chelsea
and I'm going to bed with Elettra.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.759
Good fucking night!

21:03.028 --> 21:07.332
Things are getting pretty heated in
here. Aaron's getting very hands on.

21:07.399 --> 21:10.369
I might let him slip a cheeky
finger or two, but that is it.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.705
Best first night ever.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.210
Whoa, hands off.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.444
I love a house party.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.247
We're having a house party tonight.
Oi, man.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.016
What a fucking bellend.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.351
Boobs, boobs and boobs.

21:28.286 --> 21:30.789
Does that mean I'm gonna
have to be naked? Yes!

21:30.856 --> 21:33.525
Probably the best job in the world.
(cheering)

21:39.464 --> 21:39.665
.

21:42.200 --> 21:42.401
.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.585
Someone volleyed a fucking
chicken nugget off me lip.

22:06.591 --> 22:10.262
Last night was wicked. We didn't
bang cos it was our first night,

22:10.328 --> 22:12.564
but Chelsea is putty in my hands.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.970
Morning, Samuel.
Morning, Nathan.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.672
How was your night, Sophie?

22:21.306 --> 22:23.575
The same as yours,
I was out with you!

22:23.642 --> 22:27.612
(all laugh) I think we had a really
good night, didn't we, Chloe?

22:27.679 --> 22:31.516
Yeah, there was no hanky panky. Best
fucking not have been in my bed!

22:31.583 --> 22:32.984
Hanky panky!

22:33.051 --> 22:37.689
Nothing happened between me and Sam
last night, cos I am a classy woman.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.191
Me and Marty are friends.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.160
She necked on with me.

22:42.227 --> 22:46.064
I honestly think she fancies me
more than she fancies him. She does.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.500
She likes pussy.
Would you have a threesome?

22:48.567 --> 22:52.237
Who? Her and Martin? Probably.
(all laugh)

22:55.874 --> 22:59.611
I've woke up in bed with Elettra
and once again I didn't do anything,

22:59.678 --> 23:00.879
but that's all right.

23:00.946 --> 23:04.883
I need to go see the lads, cos I'm
starting to get separation issues.

23:04.950 --> 23:08.820
(yawns) Gaz, I have to say,
you're probably the best wingman.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.289
If I didn't say it before,
I will say it again.

23:11.356 --> 23:14.259
I've been wingman-ing the shit
out of Aaron and Marty,

23:14.326 --> 23:16.762
and now eventually
they're with two girls.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.164
Got a bit of smelly fingers.
(laughs)

23:19.231 --> 23:22.701
What did you get?
A wank for 15 seconds.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.237
Any of you come?
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

23:25.303 --> 23:27.305
With Elettra, it's micro steps.

23:27.372 --> 23:30.809
Boys, I feel like coming out of
retirement and showing yous up.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.944
Lucky for yous,
I've got a girlfriend.

23:33.011 --> 23:36.214
We've done all of the initiations
I can think of, right,

23:36.281 --> 23:39.518
but the one thing

23:39.584 --> 23:42.621
that you've got to be able to
survive in this house, right,

23:42.687 --> 23:43.989
is a house party.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.158
I love a house party.

23:46.224 --> 23:49.127
And this will be the ultimate test
for them newbies.

23:49.194 --> 23:52.564
It's all on them. They've got to
do everything. (they laugh)

23:59.471 --> 24:02.507
We, over the years, have had
some insane house parties.

24:02.574 --> 24:06.077
Now we've had this idea for a party,
I need to brief the newbies

24:06.144 --> 24:10.615
and explain what we expect.
They can't fuck it up. Can they?

24:10.682 --> 24:14.119
Go out shopping, get everything
you need for a house party.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.421
And we're going to judge yous
on how well

24:16.488 --> 24:19.157
you can throw
the ultimate house party.

24:19.224 --> 24:21.860
This will be hard.
Everything has to be done.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.529
Everyone knows we love
a fucking house party.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.699
And if they can pull that off,
they deserve to stay.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.135
Yous stay down here
and start brainstorming

24:30.202 --> 24:33.805
cos you've got a lot to think about.
Let's have a party!

24:33.872 --> 24:36.541
(cheering)

24:36.608 --> 24:37.609
Leave yous to it.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.811
Right, newbies,
it's down to yous now.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.747
But trust me,
you've got a lot to live up to.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.558
Right, so, let's get thinking.

24:53.625 --> 24:57.562
Fuck me, party planning?
OK, first things first, theme.

24:57.629 --> 25:00.966
What about, like, full on charvas?
Like, proper radgies.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.935
As long as we look nice,
Don't wanna stitch ourselves.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.805
I know, we've gotta
make ourselves look nice.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.173
Sam, what do you think?

25:08.240 --> 25:12.043
Instead of dress to impress, maybe
something like "less to impress".

25:12.110 --> 25:14.479
Really small clothes,
so still sexy...

25:14.546 --> 25:17.282
But yeah, I think that's
quite a good idea.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.218
Sam's come up with the idea,
"less to impress",

25:20.285 --> 25:24.122
basically wear as little as you can,
which will be fucking mint.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.057
We can make a party good.

25:26.124 --> 25:29.327
I just hope the originals
like the theme as much as we do.

25:29.394 --> 25:32.497
They like to wear less
and we're trying to impress.

25:32.564 --> 25:33.598
Let's go!

25:40.005 --> 25:42.607
Ready?
Shall we get cracking? Let's go!

25:44.009 --> 25:46.611
We're all off to get
the supplies for the party.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.713
It's gonna look fucking sick.

25:59.491 --> 26:02.394
Less to impress. Less to impress.
Less to impress.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.065
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

26:07.132 --> 26:11.303
Less to impress is the theme.
That makes outfits so easy.

26:11.369 --> 26:15.240
Knickers, stockings and what are
them little tutu things called?

26:17.042 --> 26:18.643
I wear them every night out.

26:18.710 --> 26:21.846
We've got all the costumes,
we're gonna look mint.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.716
Let's get back to the house
and get everything ready.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.596
Thinking about how many good
house parties we've had.

26:38.663 --> 26:41.466
They've got...
There's a lot of expectations.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.868
There's a lot that goes
into a house party.

26:43.935 --> 26:47.806
Decorate the house, get props,
outfits, get a DJ, sort drinks out.

26:47.872 --> 26:51.009
And it's all down to the newbies.
This is a big challenge.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.611
Ooh.
(phone rings)

26:57.282 --> 26:58.283
Hello?

26:58.350 --> 27:00.752
First time I've ever
answered the phone.

27:06.124 --> 27:09.260
Right. Well, I'll see you later.
Ta-ra.

27:09.327 --> 27:11.329
Anna's just said
she wants to meet us.

27:11.396 --> 27:15.166
While we're out, gives them time to
decorate the house and we come back

27:15.233 --> 27:17.168
and walk in and see
how they've done.

27:17.235 --> 27:20.305
I'm loving being Anna's eyes
and ears for the newbies.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.474
Boozy meeting? No bother, Anna.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.852
We must have just missed the others.

27:33.918 --> 27:37.489
Fuck knows where they are, but right
now we've got to get this place

27:37.555 --> 27:39.557
looking M to the I to the N to the T.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.326
That spells "mint", by the way.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.763
What we gonna do?
Who's got ideas?

27:44.829 --> 27:47.565
We've got the costumes,
we've got the decorations,

27:47.632 --> 27:49.567
time to start decorating.

27:50.435 --> 27:52.170
Yes!

27:53.905 --> 27:55.473
Oh, hands off.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.679
We decorate the house,
like, amazing.

28:01.746 --> 28:06.651
Boobs, boobs, boobs,
boobs and boobs.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.823
I hope we smash this, you know.
Yeah, we will, man.

28:25.170 --> 28:28.406
Although we are working with Anna
to find the best workers,

28:28.473 --> 28:30.975
it does go on us.
We have got to live with them

28:31.042 --> 28:32.977
and we've got to like them, too.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.413
I've always thought
Eve feels a bit forced.

28:35.480 --> 28:40.518
Even when she does well. I feel
sorry for her, but she's too quiet.

28:40.585 --> 28:43.388
We're all gonna have
different opinions.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.557
But everyone's opinions count.

28:45.623 --> 28:48.026
I'd rather live with Billy
than Zahida.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.929
I'd rather live with Billy
than Zahida.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.364
Me too, yeah.
Aye, I would.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.705
Hello.
Thanks for all coming.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.208
We all know why we're here,
don't we?

29:03.274 --> 29:06.177
I like our little meetings,
little get-togethers.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.979
Anna enjoys our meetings.

29:08.046 --> 29:11.683
I bet you do. Only entertainment
you get outside the care home.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.519
How do you think
Chelsea's fitting in?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.387
Chelsea done well at work.

29:16.454 --> 29:19.457
What about as a team?
Like, in the house, outside of work,

29:19.524 --> 29:22.127
who do you think...
Sarah's still at the top.

29:22.193 --> 29:25.663
We need to think about who we can
stand to permanently live with

29:25.730 --> 29:29.200
and Sarah is on top. She's a nice
person and she's good at work.

29:29.267 --> 29:32.837
It is going to be getting
really, really busy. All right?

29:32.904 --> 29:35.206
We're playing with
people's live here.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.575
We know who we like
and we know who we don't,

29:37.642 --> 29:40.545
but Anna might not even
take notice of it. Who knows?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.281
We're having a house party tonight.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.116
Oi, man.
Martin!

29:47.552 --> 29:49.120
Wow.

29:50.655 --> 29:52.157
What are you doing?

29:52.223 --> 29:55.760
I can't believe Marty's told Anna
we're having a house party.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.129
What a fucking bellend!

29:58.196 --> 30:00.798
It's all right,
I'm cool about the house party,

30:00.865 --> 30:04.269
but only because yous have been
doing really, really well.

30:04.335 --> 30:08.706
Enjoy it, but please report
back to me, yeah? (all) Bye!

30:08.773 --> 30:10.875
Bye, team.

30:13.745 --> 30:17.048
I wanna see what they've done
to that house. Lets go, then.

30:20.919 --> 30:22.086
I'm bloated now.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.828
Hello!

30:30.895 --> 30:33.665
We arrive back at the house
and all I have to say is,

30:33.731 --> 30:35.266
what the fuck is this?

30:35.333 --> 30:37.202
What the fuck even is the theme?

30:37.268 --> 30:40.171
The theme is "less to impress".
It's actually good.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.540
I think yous have done a good job!

30:42.607 --> 30:43.841
It's so good, I love it!

30:43.908 --> 30:46.444
They've came up with
a really good theme.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.013
Wait, does that mean
I have to be naked?

30:49.080 --> 30:51.149
I fucking don't think so!

30:51.216 --> 30:54.252
Let's get ready to get this
party started! (all cheer)

31:04.128 --> 31:06.364
You know when I have
the best nights ever?

31:06.431 --> 31:08.132
When you're fucking mortal.

31:08.199 --> 31:11.269
Drunk Nathan, is on the VIP
guest list for this party.

31:11.336 --> 31:14.439
He's going to come up, rock up
and get his fucking cock out.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.647
This is getting fucking
serious now, like.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.149
This is probably the best job
in the world.

31:25.216 --> 31:31.022
You can't stick with your friends
at a party, you've got to mingle.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.224
At the end of the day,
they're the hosts.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.226
One, two, three, bosh not.

31:38.429 --> 31:43.167
Welcome to your first ever
Geordie Shore house party. Welcome.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.369
(all cheer)

31:44.435 --> 31:47.839
Everyone, P-A-R-T-Y! Cos we wanna!

31:49.440 --> 31:50.975
House party bitches!

31:54.279 --> 31:58.349
One Marty finger stroking Elettra's
clitty clitty bang bang!

32:00.318 --> 32:03.588
Does he not think it's weird
he's getting entertainment

32:03.655 --> 32:05.156
out of my naked bum cheek?!

32:11.396 --> 32:13.631
Right now, I don't know
if I'll come back.

32:18.970 --> 32:19.170
.

32:21.673 --> 32:21.873
.

32:33.584 --> 32:36.754
House party bitches!
House party bitches!

32:43.995 --> 32:46.364
My friends are here.
I'm buzzing to see them.

32:46.431 --> 32:50.535
There's been a lot of pressure on
us, now I can chill and get drunk.

32:58.676 --> 33:01.446
Don't know why Marty's
rubbing himself against us.

33:01.512 --> 33:05.516
I'm not gonna get a stiffy. Well, I
might do, but I'm gonna try not to.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.752
Wait a minute, can girls get stiffys?

33:20.531 --> 33:22.467
I don't even need a wingman any more

33:22.533 --> 33:26.704
cos all I'm going to do is just
cuddle and kiss Elettra.

33:50.828 --> 33:53.965
It doesn't matter how much of
an effort Marty makes with us.

33:54.031 --> 33:57.435
I'm not gonna go back there.
I'm a new independent classy woman.

33:58.403 --> 33:59.570
(farts)

33:59.637 --> 34:01.572
(laughs)

34:16.888 --> 34:20.324
I know for a fact me and Chelsea are
gonna be in that shag pad later.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.560
All I've got to do
is not piss Marnie off

34:22.627 --> 34:24.094
by rubbing it in her face.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.170
Aaron's right, if we're gonna
neck on, we should do it in private.

34:32.235 --> 34:35.206
Neither of us want to
rub it in Marnie's face.

34:52.123 --> 34:56.060
Marnie's saying she's OK with Aaron
and Chelsea getting with each other.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.096
I know that deep down
it's hurting her

34:58.162 --> 35:00.932
and it's only a matter of time
before she kicks off.

35:30.828 --> 35:34.165
Marty always make me laugh because
he is so stupid and so silly.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.233
I like it.

35:37.368 --> 35:39.003
Right, can I just say...

35:40.438 --> 35:43.307
I was so happy that
Chelsea walked through the door,

35:43.374 --> 35:46.010
but now that she's here,
I just wish she'd fuck off.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.429
Everything's going well. I've teed
up Chelsea for the shag pad.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.533
I'm just gonna check with Marnie
everything's all right.

36:08.599 --> 36:12.436
Even though she said it would be,
I don't want her ruining anything.

36:15.506 --> 36:18.409
Aaron hasn't spoken to us
ever since Chelsea got here.

36:18.476 --> 36:22.079
Now he's trying to be best friends
after he kissed her in front of us.

36:22.146 --> 36:25.316
He's either stupid or brave,
and I know he's not brave.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.736
A few nights ago, Marnie,
you're telling me that

36:45.803 --> 36:49.307
you want me to get with other girls.
And now I am, you can't handle it

36:49.373 --> 36:52.743
and you're kicking off for no
fucking reason. You look stupid.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.279
I'm not arsed. I don't care! Ha, ha!

36:59.283 --> 37:01.218
I'm gonna have to put myself to bed,

37:01.285 --> 37:04.055
because I just can't be arsed
with any more dramas.

37:09.193 --> 37:12.096
Most nights, me and Chloe
always have a cheeky neck on,

37:12.163 --> 37:15.066
but I feel like Chloe's
still got feelings for Martin.

37:15.132 --> 37:17.768
Tonight, me and her
are better off just as mates.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.419
Mate, what happened there?

37:35.486 --> 37:38.589
I just seen you getting
collared by the fucking birds.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.358
Marnie is messing with my head.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.627
I didn't think I'd done
anything wrong,

37:42.693 --> 37:44.862
or she'd be able to
have a problem with it.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.331
I need to talk this out
with a grown-up.

37:47.398 --> 37:53.337
I am sick of Marnie dictating what
you do, right? She's got a boyfriend,

37:53.404 --> 37:55.740
she hasn't got a leg to stand on.

37:55.806 --> 38:00.211
There's nothing more I can say or do.
Aaron, it's up to you, mate.

38:09.053 --> 38:12.123
So far,
the night is a roaring success.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.925
We're absolutely smashing it

38:14.992 --> 38:17.395
and I want everyone
to go fucking radge.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.735
I see Nathan's mate,
he's looking canny fit

38:24.802 --> 38:26.637
so I just neck on with him.

38:33.711 --> 38:36.047
Tonight is my night off.

38:36.113 --> 38:38.616
What does Angel Nathan
do on his night off?

38:38.683 --> 38:42.086
Do shots of tequila, vodka.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.689
Basically, anything
I can get my hands on.

38:44.755 --> 38:47.591
I'm fucking shit-faced.

38:57.868 --> 39:00.805
Marnie said for us to be a player,
and there's a posh lad

39:00.871 --> 39:02.907
who looks exactly like Prince Harry.

39:02.973 --> 39:05.176
Ooh, I've always wanted
to be a princess.

39:14.485 --> 39:17.922
Nice one.
Chloe's been distracted by some kid

39:17.988 --> 39:21.025
that looks like he's just
been dropped off by his butler.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.828
Which means she won't be
kicking off with Elettra,

39:23.894 --> 39:27.264
and that means I might have a
chance of shagging her! Hopefully.

39:34.171 --> 39:38.776
I feel so drunk, but now it's
time to relax in the Jacuzzi.

39:43.147 --> 39:45.049
Touchdown. Guess what.

39:45.116 --> 39:49.687
I've moved past kisses and cuddles,
my pinkie is now in her pinkie.

39:49.754 --> 39:54.391
One Marty finger stroking
Elettra's clitty clitty bang bang.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.698
Tonight has been a belter.

40:00.765 --> 40:03.567
Us newbies have pulled off
a wicked house party.

40:03.634 --> 40:07.104
Time to get these pissed-up radgies
the fuck out of here.

40:14.311 --> 40:18.449
I'm really thirsty, so what
better to do than drink the punch

40:18.516 --> 40:19.917
and get more drunk?

40:27.124 --> 40:29.226
I feel like tonight
has been a success.

40:29.293 --> 40:31.629
I've got pissed,
overall wicked night.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.499
Gary's whipping me and I'm naked.

40:35.566 --> 40:38.869
Does he not think it's weird
that he's getting enjoyment

40:38.936 --> 40:40.771
out of my naked bum cheeks?

40:40.838 --> 40:43.674
I don't fucking care.

40:50.147 --> 40:53.217
This party has been wicked.
The newbies have done well.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.920
Chelsea, me and you
are going to the shag pad.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.424
Marnie's going to freak out
when she hears about this,

41:00.491 --> 41:03.127
but I'm gonna creep upstairs
and have a good look

41:03.194 --> 41:06.263
because I love a free sex show.

41:13.971 --> 41:17.508
Sophie and Chloe are spying on Aaron
and Chelsea in the shag pad.

41:17.575 --> 41:22.079
Come on, girls, you know I can't
not look. Of course I'm gonna look!

41:26.917 --> 41:30.254
Marnie, I really don't think
you should see this.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.498
I literally can't get over
what I'm seeing.

41:41.565 --> 41:44.768
Chelsea's been in the house
no more than five minutes,

41:44.835 --> 41:49.440
and she's on top of Aaron, grinding
in the shag pad. What the fuck?

41:49.506 --> 41:52.276
Oh, God, man!
Marnie, don't. Marnie.

41:53.644 --> 41:55.479
I knew this was gonna happen.

41:55.546 --> 41:59.683
If you're living with your ex,
you will never ever fully move on.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.253
Marnie, come on!
Marnie, Marnie, Marnie!

42:07.958 --> 42:10.928
Me and Chelsea are in the shag pad
messing around.

42:12.229 --> 42:15.532
And then fucking Marnie
starts kicking off. Here we go.

42:17.635 --> 42:21.171
This whole situation with Chelsea
and Aaron is embarrassing us

42:21.238 --> 42:25.175
and I'm embarrassing myself. I just
need to get away and clear my head.

42:28.479 --> 42:29.880
Marnie has gone ape shit.

42:29.947 --> 42:32.783
I guess the situation
wasn't as simple as I thought.

42:32.850 --> 42:34.585
I tried to make a big impact,

42:34.652 --> 42:37.521
but I could have ruined
my chances of staying on.

42:48.165 --> 42:51.302
Everyone's asleep,
but this situation with Aaron

42:51.368 --> 42:54.939
and Chelsea has made it really
difficult for us to be in the house.

42:55.005 --> 42:58.175
I feel like I need to go,
and I don't know if I'll come back.

43:08.118 --> 43:10.888
Everyone's gonna blame me
for Marnie leaving.

43:10.955 --> 43:14.024
It just makes her relationship
look pathetic.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.360
Ow! me knee!

43:16.427 --> 43:17.962
Fuckin' dinosaur.

43:18.028 --> 43:22.199
I managed to get more than a neck on
with Elettra, I fingered her.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.701
Slippy slide, finger in.

43:23.767 --> 43:26.870
No! No, not true.
Fucking liar.

43:29.206 --> 43:33.010
Wow. If I don't say your name,
pack your bags... What the fuck?

43:33.077 --> 43:34.578
...and go home.

43:34.645 --> 43:35.879
Right now?
Right now.

44:02.439 --> 44:02.639
.
