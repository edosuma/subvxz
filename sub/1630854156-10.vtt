WEBVTT

00:03.746 --> 00:05.562
(tapping)

00:05.581 --> 00:08.232
Look at my Gene-y Gene
practicing.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.916
And that sound is gonna...

00:10.011 --> 00:11.235
keep going or what?

00:11.328 --> 00:12.569
I was curious about that.

00:12.588 --> 00:14.254
I just want the performance
to be perfect.

00:14.406 --> 00:16.181
If you installed
xylophones in the booths,

00:16.408 --> 00:18.425
like I requested,
this would sound better.

00:18.577 --> 00:21.261
Well, it's great you're
so excited about tonight.

00:21.413 --> 00:22.412
Of course I am.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.356
It's Ms. Merkin's
first-ever original

00:24.525 --> 00:26.841
sixth grade
holiday all-xylophone

00:26.861 --> 00:28.009
musical spectacular.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.586
She says it's about
love and loss

00:29.679 --> 00:31.846
and online shopping
and the end of innocence.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.014
It's her greatest work.

00:33.108 --> 00:35.200
Aw, I'm so sad
I'm gonna miss it.

00:35.427 --> 00:37.202
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get it all on tape.

00:37.429 --> 00:39.521
And your mother's gonna record
Tina's Thundergirl thing,

00:39.540 --> 00:41.874
and we'll watch them both
when we all get home tonight.

00:42.025 --> 00:45.544
A cheap phone and an
old camcorder, battling it out.

00:45.695 --> 00:47.437
Oh, my teeny Tina.

00:47.456 --> 00:50.774
The star of the Thundergirls'
holiday play at City Hall Plaza.

00:50.867 --> 00:54.386
The star<i> in</i> the Thundergirls'
holiday play at City Hall Plaza.

00:54.538 --> 00:57.723
I'm a star. Like, an actual star
in-in the sky.

00:57.874 --> 00:59.466
But still, the star.

00:59.635 --> 01:01.543
Everybody's roles
are pretty much the same size.

01:01.637 --> 01:03.637
Mom's really confused
by the star thing.

01:03.789 --> 01:05.230
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.
-Where's your sister?

01:05.457 --> 01:06.565
Louise is coming with me, right?

01:06.716 --> 01:08.400
I guess she can go
with either one of us.

01:08.627 --> 01:10.569
How did you two choose
who was gonna go to what?

01:10.796 --> 01:12.554
Flipped a coin.
Calmly flipped a coin.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.741
(groans) Cut me in half
so I can go to both.

01:15.968 --> 01:17.134
Oh, God.

01:17.227 --> 01:18.893
-Oh, crap.
-Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

01:18.987 --> 01:20.470
-It's under the fridge.
I got it.
-(dry heaves)

01:20.489 --> 01:22.730
-I almost threw up.
-I was also very torn.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.417
But you actually weren't
'cause my thing is indoors.

01:25.527 --> 01:27.661
-I mean, it's cold out.
-No, I get it completely.

01:27.830 --> 01:29.404
-There she is. You ready to go?
-Yeah.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.406
-Who's taking me to the library?
-You want to go to Tina's thing

01:31.500 --> 01:33.258
-or Gene's thing? Wait, what?
-Sorry, what?

01:33.410 --> 01:35.243
-Who's taking me to the library?
-You want to go to Tina's thing

01:35.262 --> 01:36.320
-or Gene's thing?
-Wait, what's happening?

01:36.413 --> 01:38.839
Remember,
the holiday poetry contest

01:38.991 --> 01:39.840
at the library?

01:39.934 --> 01:41.158
I got selected to read my poem

01:41.176 --> 01:42.159
BOTH: That's tonight?

01:42.161 --> 01:43.844
Sounds like you're both

01:43.996 --> 01:44.845
excited about it?

01:44.997 --> 01:46.163
I thought it was tomorrow.

01:46.181 --> 01:47.831
I only know what she knows.

01:47.850 --> 01:50.258
It's fine. It's not a big deal.
You know the drill.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.927
Every year, I enter a poem
with the word "poop" in it,

01:52.947 --> 01:54.171
so that, if it gets selected,

01:54.264 --> 01:55.763
I get to say "poop"
in the library.

01:55.858 --> 01:57.432
And they put the poem
on the wall for a month.

01:57.526 --> 01:59.601
That's not a great reason...
Never mind.

01:59.695 --> 02:02.028
Anyway, this year, I...
Well, um,

02:02.181 --> 02:03.938
somehow I got in.
I just need a ride.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.682
You don't have to stay.
In fact, I don't want you there.

02:05.701 --> 02:07.775
If you tried to stay,
I'd say, "Go on, get,"

02:07.795 --> 02:09.686
-and I'd spray you
with the hose.
-Wow.

02:09.705 --> 02:12.280
Two parents, three kids'
Christmas performances.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.466
Dear, God, why?
There's got to be a way.

02:14.693 --> 02:17.544
-What time does
everyone's thing start?
-KIDS: 6:00.

02:17.696 --> 02:19.045
(wails)

02:19.198 --> 02:20.213
-(crying)
-Lin, easy.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.882
S-Someone's gonna
call the police.

02:22.034 --> 02:23.700
Hi. She's happy.
She's-she's good.

02:23.793 --> 02:26.478
Uh... I-I think we got to go
with Louise's plan.

02:26.630 --> 02:29.148
Lin, you drop her at the library
on the way to city hall,

02:29.299 --> 02:30.983
and then pick her up
on your way back.

02:31.134 --> 02:33.152
I will walk over
to the school with Gene.

02:33.303 --> 02:34.728
Louise, you'll just have to

02:34.880 --> 02:37.547
kind of recreate the reading
for us tonight, okay?

02:37.566 --> 02:39.399
We really want to hear
your poop poem.

02:39.551 --> 02:41.067
I get it.
I'll do a reenactment later.

02:41.236 --> 02:42.402
I'll give myself a funny accent.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.888
Ugh, this is the worst day
of my life.

02:44.907 --> 02:46.481
Yup. So, w-we should go. Gene?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.483
-Camera, Bob. Camera!
-Right, right.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.910
-Sorry.
-Get a good angle!

02:50.004 --> 02:52.504
-Okay, okay.
-This is killing me.

02:52.656 --> 02:53.397
Oh, my God.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.156
So, the poem you submitted

02:55.250 --> 02:56.991
was<i> Who Picks Up</i>
<i> the Reindeer Poop?</i>

02:57.011 --> 02:59.403
-Um, yeah.
-I still think you should've
submitted something

02:59.421 --> 03:02.163
from the heart this year,
not so much about poop.

03:02.241 --> 03:03.331
I know.
That would've been hilarious.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.017
-What're you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

03:05.168 --> 03:08.078
I've been trying to convince
Louise to submit an actual poem

03:08.080 --> 03:09.746
for the holiday poetry contest.

03:09.839 --> 03:12.098
<i>Who Picks Up the Reindeer Poop?</i>
is an actual poem.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.508
And, frankly, it's a subject

03:13.527 --> 03:14.935
that everyone
should be talking about.

03:15.087 --> 03:16.028
I mean, why don't we
talk about it?

03:16.179 --> 03:17.178
Right, but, I mean, a poem

03:17.272 --> 03:18.438
about something that's

03:18.532 --> 03:21.349
important to you,
or a feeling, or...

03:21.368 --> 03:23.276
Okay, Tina-ly Dickinson,
I get it.

03:23.429 --> 03:24.519
You like feelings.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.613
Some of us answer
to a higher calling, okay?

03:26.690 --> 03:28.207
The word "poop" on the wall

03:28.358 --> 03:30.617
at the library for one month.
Let's drop it, all right?

03:30.711 --> 03:33.453
But didn't you say you wrote
a "dumb serious" one,

03:33.605 --> 03:35.547
which were your words not mine.
Can I just see your folder?

03:35.699 --> 03:37.699
-I thought I saw you
put something...
-Tina, enough.

03:37.793 --> 03:40.201
I'm not gonna be poop-shamed
during the holidays.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.295
Okay, we're here.
I'm double parked, so, Tina,

03:42.448 --> 03:44.130
stay in the car.
I'm gonna walk Louise in.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.207
There's gonna be some hugging,
and I might cry,

03:46.227 --> 03:47.875
but we also have to hurry.
Where's tissues?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.377
Forget it, I'll use my sleeve.

03:49.504 --> 03:51.455
-What do we do?
Can we do something?
-I don't know.

03:51.548 --> 03:54.549
Geez. What's going on?
People seem sort of upset?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.460
I don't know. Grown-ups always
look that way to me.

03:56.553 --> 03:59.387
Hi. I'm Rachel.
I mean, Miss Bisselbender.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.223
I'm, um, I'm the substitute
music teacher. (chuckles)

04:02.317 --> 04:04.910
-The what?!
-I know. Uh, Ms. Merkin's sister

04:05.061 --> 04:06.745
had an emergency appendectomy,

04:06.896 --> 04:09.248
-and Ms. Merkin was still
gonna come to this...
-Of course.

04:09.475 --> 04:11.232
But then,
her appendix burst, too.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.418
-Aah!
-I guess you can have
a sympathetic appendix.

04:13.570 --> 04:16.146
Anyway, she's gonna be fine,
but she's in surgery

04:16.164 --> 04:18.114
with her sister,
and the school called me

04:18.166 --> 04:19.483
and I'm supposed
to run the assembly

04:19.501 --> 04:21.334
because it was too late
to call it off.

04:21.487 --> 04:22.319
Okay.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.155
-And what an opportunity.
-Uh-huh.

04:25.248 --> 04:27.324
But I also don't know
anything about music.

04:27.342 --> 04:28.600
-BOTH: Oh.
-And I told the school that

04:28.827 --> 04:31.328
when they called me,
but they said I'm the only sub

04:31.497 --> 04:33.254
that answered the phone,
so I had to come

04:33.348 --> 04:35.499
if I ever wanted to
"work in this town again."

04:35.592 --> 04:37.334
-Uh-huh.
-Uh, so why don't you, uh,

04:37.427 --> 04:40.279
go look apprehensive
with the other parents, and...

04:40.430 --> 04:42.114
-Gene.
-Gene, you come with me,

04:42.341 --> 04:43.931
and we'll, um,
we'll get through this.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.933
-(whimpers)
-It should be okay.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.435
You've been practicing, right?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.179
Yeah, but... (sighs)
Well, I'm not sure

04:49.272 --> 04:51.105
we can do this without
Ms. Merkin directing us.

04:51.199 --> 04:52.682
She kind of realized
that none of us

04:52.776 --> 04:55.368
were good at reading music,
so she came up with a system.

04:55.521 --> 04:56.611
"This note is C.

04:56.705 --> 04:58.688
The one we talked about.
When you get here..."

04:58.707 --> 05:00.281
<i> MS. MERKIN:</i>
<i> "...look at me. I'll point up</i>

05:00.375 --> 05:01.949
<i> "when you should play</i>
<i> a whole step up,</i>

05:02.044 --> 05:04.210
<i> "and I'll point down when you</i>
<i> should play a whole step down.</i>

05:04.305 --> 05:05.637
<i> With my other hand,</i>
<i> I'll indicate the rhythm."</i>

05:05.789 --> 05:07.547
-Oh, boy.
-BISSELBENDER:
Okay, sixth graders,

05:07.699 --> 05:08.698
follow me.

05:08.867 --> 05:11.034
Parents, take your seats.
No one panic.

05:11.053 --> 05:13.036
It's fine. I mean, welcome.

05:13.055 --> 05:15.630
<i> (chuckles) Thank you.</i>

05:15.724 --> 05:16.648
Whew.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.558
Big turnout.
Lot of poetry lovers.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.135
Hi, how are you?
Oh, you're not looking at me.

05:21.304 --> 05:23.396
You're looking at him.
Great, great, great.

05:23.549 --> 05:26.158
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> This is good. Good costume.</i>

05:26.309 --> 05:27.400
-Thank you.
-You make this?

05:27.477 --> 05:29.235
Yes, I stayed up
all night, but it's fine

05:29.388 --> 05:30.812
because I don't have
a full-time job.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.854
Just kidding, I do.

05:31.856 --> 05:33.314
But so nice for the girls.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.559
<i> Winter Traditions</i>
<i> from Around the World.</i>

05:35.652 --> 05:37.243
I got it off the Internet
'cause all the parts

05:37.338 --> 05:39.153
were the same size
and it seemed sweet.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.064
18 different costumes, Linda.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.067
I didn't see that crucial detail
till it was too late to change.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.585
Ginny's a little stretched.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.571
Did the girls audition for the
parts, or how did you choose?

05:47.589 --> 05:49.406
-Randomly assigned.
-Randomly assigned, I told you.

05:49.575 --> 05:52.834
Still, fits her like a glove,
this outfit.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.001
I wanted to be the star.

05:54.096 --> 05:55.354
You're the candle, Harley.

05:55.505 --> 05:57.414
You have pathos.
You have emotion.

05:57.432 --> 05:59.933
It's fire. Be the fire, Harley.

06:00.085 --> 06:01.434
I'm four other parts, too,

06:01.587 --> 06:02.936
but the star is kind of
a through line.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.512
Uh-huh.
(whispering): Watch your back.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.273
She's gunning for you.
They all are.

06:07.426 --> 06:09.201
So, she gave you all
sheets of paper,

06:09.352 --> 06:11.185
but they basically
just say to look at her

06:11.279 --> 06:12.445
and she'll tell you what to do

06:12.598 --> 06:13.947
-with her hands?
-STUDENTS: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

06:14.099 --> 06:15.432
At the same time, even though

06:15.450 --> 06:17.525
-some of you play
different notes?
-STUDENTS: Mm-hmm.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.269
That doesn't seem...
Is that possible?

06:19.287 --> 06:22.272
-Ms. Merkin's in Mensa.
-She's on a whole other level.

06:22.290 --> 06:25.083
Would you say this is
important to you guys?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.459
STUDENTS:
Yeah.

06:26.612 --> 06:28.035
-Ms. Merkin's
my favorite teacher.
-Same.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.613
She's my 68-year-old
soul sister.

06:29.631 --> 06:32.282
All right. Understood.
We'll just have to, um,

06:32.451 --> 06:35.877
figure out a way to, uh,
make Ms. Merkin proud.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.287
We probably have
about one minute.

06:37.347 --> 06:38.730
Anyone want to explain
music to me real quick,

06:38.957 --> 06:41.307
so I can make it happen
with my arms somehow tonight?

06:41.460 --> 06:43.235
Uh... I'll start
at the beginning.

06:43.462 --> 06:45.404
I'll start with Prince.
Who's got an MP3 player?

06:45.597 --> 06:47.647
How are you
with explicit lyrics?

06:47.799 --> 06:49.241
Where's Linda, Bob?

06:49.392 --> 06:50.742
We had to split up tonight.

06:50.894 --> 06:53.303
Our oldest is doing a play
at City Hall Plaza.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.747
We're rushing out after this
to go see our oldest do,

06:55.974 --> 06:57.082
uh, choir at the high school.

06:57.309 --> 06:58.566
Is that how you say that,
"do choir"?

06:58.660 --> 07:00.160
-Yeah, that's right.
-That sounds right.

07:00.312 --> 07:02.312
We, uh, we actually have
three kids' things tonight.

07:02.330 --> 07:03.647
We're missing one completely.

07:03.815 --> 07:04.831
-Oh...
-Oh.
-(winces)

07:04.983 --> 07:06.407
Oh. You all just reacted

07:06.427 --> 07:07.817
more than I thought you would.

07:07.911 --> 07:09.152
Now I feel really bad.

07:09.171 --> 07:10.820
-No...
-No. No.

07:10.839 --> 07:13.156
-There you go.
-Thanks for your help, Linda.

07:13.249 --> 07:14.433
This all went more smoothly

07:14.660 --> 07:15.917
when the dress rehearsal
was in my apartment,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.327
and we didn't do
the "dress" part.

07:17.345 --> 07:19.162
No problem.
Hey, you don't want to put on

07:19.331 --> 07:20.588
a show like this without a...

07:20.607 --> 07:22.165
-What is this?
-Yule log.

07:22.258 --> 07:24.109
Norse tradition,
not a giant poop.

07:24.260 --> 07:26.002
Oh, no, I didn't think that.

07:26.171 --> 07:28.004
It's come up. Thank you, Jodi.

07:28.173 --> 07:29.597
-Sorry, once you see it...
-No, I know.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.524
-JODI: Poop.
-GINNY: Yup.
<i> -TINA: Hmm.</i>

07:31.677 --> 07:33.843
<i> Wonder if Louise</i>
<i> has read her poop poem yet.</i>

07:33.862 --> 07:35.436
<i>She was acting weird in the car.</i>

07:35.514 --> 07:37.013
I still think
you should've submitted

07:37.032 --> 07:38.198
something from the heart
this year.

07:38.274 --> 07:39.699
I know. That would've
been hilarious.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.201
<i> -TINA: I think...</i>
-But didn't you say

07:41.353 --> 07:42.852
you wrote a dumb serious one,

07:42.913 --> 07:44.854
which were your words not mine.
Can I just see your folder?

07:44.873 --> 07:47.073
-I thought I saw you
put something...
-Tina, enough.

07:47.225 --> 07:49.301
<i> TINA:</i>
<i> Did she...</i>

07:49.528 --> 07:50.210
Oh, my God.

07:50.362 --> 07:51.470
What, you got to pee?

07:51.697 --> 07:53.046
Too long to get you
out of there.

07:53.198 --> 07:54.121
Hold it, honey.
Everyone hold it, okay?

07:54.216 --> 07:55.456
YULE LOG GIRLS:
Okay.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.124
No, Mom, I think Louise
wrote a real poem

07:57.293 --> 07:58.551
for that library contest.

07:58.704 --> 08:00.145
I think she was embarrassed

08:00.372 --> 08:03.631
to admit that it might actually
be important to her.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.150
What?!

08:05.301 --> 08:07.043
<i> That sneaky sneak head.</i>

08:07.212 --> 08:08.636
<i> And no parent there to see it.</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:10.213
<i> She's all alone.</i>

08:10.232 --> 08:12.407
<i> TINA:</i>
<i>Maybe they're livestreaming it?</i>
<i> Probably not.</i>

08:16.071 --> 08:18.830
-GINNY: Thundergirls Troop
number 119 proudly presents...
-Call me back.

08:18.982 --> 08:20.406
...where poetry was born.

08:20.559 --> 08:22.167
Even before the written word,
people gathered by the fire,

08:22.360 --> 08:25.319
and there were odes and sermons.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.248
You know what I think the very
first poem was called?

08:28.400 --> 08:29.991
<i> -How Great is This Fire?</i>
-...while the students get, uh,

08:30.068 --> 08:31.251
settled behind
their instruments,

08:31.345 --> 08:32.919
-I'll say a few words.
-(phone buzzing)

08:33.071 --> 08:34.629
-(whispers): Sorry.
-BISSELBENDER: Which is what
I'm doing.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.681
-These are words.
Tonight we're playing...
-Sorry.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.166
-BISSELBENDER: Twerkin' Merkin's
Holiday Xylo-Jam.
-I'm sorry. Sorry. So sorry.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.094
-Louise what?
-She tricked us.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.262
She wrote a real poem.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.930
-Why would she do that?
-I know.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.190
What, she's sincere
all of a sudden?

08:45.341 --> 08:46.507
No, why would she trick us?

08:46.601 --> 08:48.418
Maybe 'cause she was hiding
her hurt feelings

08:48.420 --> 08:50.344
-that we couldn't go.
-Oh, God.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.197
I was wondering why
they chose a poop poem.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.181
I assumed they were
just being edgy.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.092
Bob, one of us
has to get over there

08:56.185 --> 08:57.443
to hear her read that poem.

08:57.596 --> 08:59.371
You're right, you're right.
Uh, you have the car.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.873
Can you go to Louise's thing
after Tina's?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.266
Or partway or something?

09:03.285 --> 09:05.359
Ugh, I would go,
but I'm a stagehand now.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.288
The troop leader--
uh, she's a little overwhelmed.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.939
You should see
the substitute teacher

09:10.033 --> 09:11.032
trying to run Gene's assembly.

09:11.126 --> 09:12.292
Look, I-I know you're on foot,

09:12.386 --> 09:13.960
but how long is Gene's thing?

09:14.112 --> 09:15.554
45 minutes? An hour?

09:15.663 --> 09:19.115
Could you, like, slip out, and
take, a-a cab to the library

09:19.134 --> 09:21.226
and then come back
and see the end of Gene's?

09:21.377 --> 09:23.136
What, like, go to both, somehow?

09:23.288 --> 09:25.789
-Louise has nobody.
-I... I mean, I...

09:25.882 --> 09:26.973
I guess? I don't...

09:27.067 --> 09:28.458
(gasps)
Oh, my God! There's a cab!

09:28.551 --> 09:30.718
Uh, I'll-I'll,
uh, I'll call you back, Lin.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.811
Taxi!

09:32.055 --> 09:33.129
Christmas morning.

09:33.148 --> 09:35.723
Christmas mourning. I miss her

09:35.817 --> 09:37.650
so much it hurts.

09:37.803 --> 09:38.910
Peppermint tears.

09:39.062 --> 09:41.154
Grandma feels near
this year, but...

09:41.230 --> 09:43.081
not anywhere I can reach.

09:43.308 --> 09:44.824
-(applause)
-(sniffles)

09:44.918 --> 09:47.143
Thank you, Aliah. Amazing.

09:47.236 --> 09:50.922
Whew. Okay, next up,
uh, Benjamin Branf.

09:50.999 --> 09:53.316
Good luck following that.

09:53.409 --> 09:55.594
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
You'll be great.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.503
(panting)

09:57.598 --> 09:59.413
You drove so far
before you saw me.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.099
Sorry about that.
I thought you were a jogger,

10:01.250 --> 10:02.267
and you were going
the same way as me.

10:02.494 --> 10:03.918
That's why I gave you
the thumbs up.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.586
I yelled so much.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.180
So, if you were yelling, I
apologize. I don't hear so well.

10:07.332 --> 10:09.332
You're, uh, you're taking me
to the library, right?

10:09.351 --> 10:11.092
-To the what?
-Where are we?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.685
-Like, what town?
-No.

10:12.838 --> 10:14.170
Are you taking me
to the library?

10:14.263 --> 10:16.339
-You said "refinery."
-No. What?

10:16.358 --> 10:18.024
Oh, my God,
we're going the wrong way.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.143
Uh, I need you to take me to
the library, the public library,

10:21.145 --> 10:22.454
-that's what I said.
-Oh...

10:22.681 --> 10:24.514
What refinery
were you taking me to?

10:24.607 --> 10:26.199
I don't know,
but I didn't want to seem

10:26.351 --> 10:27.533
like I didn't know, you know?

10:27.702 --> 10:29.185
-Agh!
-All right, let me see

10:29.204 --> 10:30.611
if there's a place
I can turn around.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.872
I got to be honest,
I'm not great at turning around.

10:33.024 --> 10:34.115
Oh, this can't be happening.

10:34.209 --> 10:36.876
(xylophones playing haphazardly)

10:37.028 --> 10:38.720
(groans)

10:44.219 --> 10:46.293
TINA:
A star's light shines

10:46.313 --> 10:47.812
more brightly in the winter sky.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.630
-A star's light can bring hope,
-A star's light can bring hope,

10:49.650 --> 10:51.557
-can inspire great journeys.
-can inspire great journeys.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.526
(grunting)

10:55.304 --> 10:57.230
-Mom, go to Louise's thing.
-I can't,

10:57.382 --> 10:59.065
but it's okay,
your father's going.

10:59.217 --> 11:00.474
Also, don't you have
another scene?

11:00.494 --> 11:02.327
It doesn't matter.
I don't have any lines in it.

11:02.478 --> 11:04.145
How is Dad going to Louise's?

11:04.222 --> 11:06.072
-We have the car.
-He's taking a cab.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.332
He's probably there by now.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.000
<i> -DRIVER: Is that it?</i>
<i> -BOB: No.</i>

11:09.152 --> 11:10.393
Is that it?

11:10.486 --> 11:12.170
Do-do you know
what a library looks like?

11:12.339 --> 11:13.487
(laughing) I know, right?

11:13.581 --> 11:14.506
I think, um...

11:14.733 --> 11:15.990
Actually, I think
I know where we are.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.592
Uh, j-j-just let me out here.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.345
Um, keep the change.
Happy holidays.

11:20.496 --> 11:22.238
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

11:22.331 --> 11:24.908
That's not a good thing
for a cab driver to say.

11:25.001 --> 11:27.519
(sighs)
Library. Oh, come on.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.913
Other people have maps
that work. Nope.

11:29.931 --> 11:32.173
Okay.
Calling Linda. Lin?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.750
Did you see it?
Was it good?

11:33.768 --> 11:35.268
The cab was a disaster.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.769
Uh, I'm not at the library yet.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.921
Oh, Bob.

11:37.939 --> 11:39.013
She might've read it by now.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.181
Do you see any, uh...

11:40.200 --> 11:42.200
bicycles you could hop on?
Or horses?

11:42.427 --> 11:44.928
I'm running.
I'm hoping for a miracle here.

11:45.021 --> 11:46.520
Also, do you know the address
of the library?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.206
Yeah, I just
dropped her off there.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.266
It's, uh, it's on that street.

11:50.285 --> 11:52.101
Oh, my God, I'm blanking.
What's the street?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.102
You know the one.

11:53.121 --> 11:54.379
Wait! I see it! Yes!

11:54.530 --> 11:56.773
I see the library.
The back of it.

11:56.791 --> 11:58.032
Lin, I'll call you back
in a bit.

11:58.126 --> 11:59.867
The back of it?
Oh, he hung up.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.294
Uh, good job out there.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.279
Uh... Okay...

12:03.298 --> 12:05.131
-Uh, hi. Hey.
-Hey?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.783
-Wow, that's bright.
-Thank you.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.618
Do you know if there's a way
to get through the fence there?

12:08.636 --> 12:10.286
-To get to the library?
-To the library?

12:10.305 --> 12:12.472
Yeah. My daughter's
about to read a poem.

12:12.624 --> 12:14.232
A sincere poem.
If I have to go all the way

12:14.309 --> 12:15.716
around the block,
I'm worried I'll miss it.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.068
A sincere poem?

12:17.220 --> 12:19.220
Yeah, it turns out.
Not like her.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.314
I don't know a way through,
but I'll give you a boost.

12:21.466 --> 12:24.242
-(both grunting)
-(barking)

12:24.469 --> 12:26.077
-Louie, no!
-What's happening?

12:26.304 --> 12:27.245
-Sorry.
-(grunts)

12:27.396 --> 12:29.138
-(screams)
-Louie, down.

12:29.157 --> 12:30.473
-Down, Louie.
-Aah! Why's he doing this?

12:30.566 --> 12:32.917
Maybe he thinks you're
a burglar? Uh, kisses.

12:33.069 --> 12:35.236
-Just kisses, Louie.
-(grunts)

12:35.404 --> 12:37.422
-Uh, thanks?
-Oh, you're welcome.

12:37.649 --> 12:38.648
Oh...

12:38.741 --> 12:42.076
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:42.170 --> 12:43.410
What happened here?

12:43.505 --> 12:45.655
I'm at the library,
she's not at the library.

12:45.673 --> 12:47.432
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> What was I thinking?</i>
<i> I can't read this.</i>

12:47.659 --> 12:49.083
<i> What if they hate it?</i>

12:49.252 --> 12:51.436
<i> I could... read this one.</i>

12:51.663 --> 12:53.846
<i> They'll be like, "That's</i>
<i> not the poem you submitted,"</i>

12:54.015 --> 12:56.441
<i> but by the time they</i>
<i> figure it out, I'll be done.</i>

12:56.668 --> 13:00.353
<i> I'll be out of here. Did I put</i>
<i> my tights on backwards?</i>

13:00.505 --> 13:01.696
<i> Yes, I did.</i>

13:06.177 --> 13:07.601
-(phone vibrates)
-Bob?

13:07.695 --> 13:08.953
(panting)
Wrong branch.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.789
-What?! Right, sorry.
-Shh.

13:10.940 --> 13:12.791
I went to the main branch
of the library.

13:12.942 --> 13:14.367
They're closed.
Where's Louise?

13:14.519 --> 13:16.202
Our branch, the local branch.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.778
You went to the main branch?

13:17.798 --> 13:18.946
There's a local branch?

13:18.965 --> 13:20.206
Did we used to come to this one?

13:20.358 --> 13:22.208
Yeah. Then they built one
closer to us.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.511
Oh, it's too many libraries.
There should just be one.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.879
I mean, I wouldn't run
for office on that platform.

13:27.032 --> 13:29.808
Oh, I feel really bad
about myself right now.

13:29.993 --> 13:31.551
Oh, God, we're bad parents.

13:31.703 --> 13:33.052
Should I go?
I can't go.

13:33.204 --> 13:35.204
Listen, I'm going back
to school,

13:35.298 --> 13:36.722
to catch the end of Gene's.

13:36.891 --> 13:38.799
I... I hate the holidays, Lin.

13:38.893 --> 13:41.302
<i> -No.</i>
-All right, I don't. I don't,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.880
but I-I definitely
hate running,

13:43.898 --> 13:44.972
and I've been doing a lot of it,

13:45.024 --> 13:46.566
and I hate this camera bag. Oh!

13:46.660 --> 13:49.235
-Bob? Bob?
<i> -(crying) Ow!</i>

13:49.387 --> 13:51.830
-(playing haphazardly)
-Okay... Okay.

13:51.981 --> 13:52.980
Okay. Hey.

13:53.074 --> 13:55.074
(chuckles)
Thank you.

13:55.226 --> 13:57.484
That was, I think,
three different songs

13:57.579 --> 14:00.063
being played at the same time,
and that is on me.

14:00.156 --> 14:01.322
-(scattered applause)
-We are going

14:01.416 --> 14:03.157
to, uh, have
a little intermission now.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.992
Please, um, don't leave.
I mean, you know,

14:05.161 --> 14:06.736
stay in the auditorium.

14:06.754 --> 14:08.571
We're just, um... We're gonna
huddle up for a sec, and

14:08.590 --> 14:10.256
we'll be right back
to finish our program

14:10.408 --> 14:11.349
for this evening. Again, uh,

14:11.576 --> 14:13.092
don't leave.
Uh, I mean, you have to take

14:13.244 --> 14:15.078
your children home with you,
so you can't.

14:15.171 --> 14:18.172
(chuckles)
Okay, um... bye.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.265
We're terrible.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.342
I've never heard
angry applause before.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.362
No. No, you're not terrible.
We had a good start,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.923
then ten or 12 minutes
of a kind of...

14:27.016 --> 14:28.107
Musical torture?

14:28.259 --> 14:29.701
Experimental torture.

14:29.852 --> 14:31.369
-But we can finish strong.
-How?

14:31.596 --> 14:33.746
I don't know.
What would Ms. Merkin do?

14:34.933 --> 14:36.265
-I don't know.
-Aah!

14:36.284 --> 14:37.375
Hey. Uh, hi.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.785
I'm trained in trauma
and disaster counseling.

14:39.938 --> 14:41.379
-Thank you. That's not helpful.
-Sorry.

14:41.606 --> 14:44.290
Just... I'm trained, and
I'm available to do that, now.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.200
Should we just not play anymore?

14:46.294 --> 14:48.778
Like, at all? Ever?
As a group of people?

14:48.871 --> 14:49.795
Wait, that's it.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.781
-It is?
-No. Uh, yeah.

14:51.799 --> 14:53.282
We're playing too much.

14:53.301 --> 14:56.043
Uh, too many notes.
What if we have fewer choices?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.454
I don't know what you mean,
but I love this tone of voice.

14:58.547 --> 15:00.473
HARLEY and GINNY:
Myths, traditions.

15:00.642 --> 15:03.384
-Go.

Mom, seriously,
go to Louise's thing.

15:11.819 --> 15:13.469
Dad didn't make it,
but you can still go.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.655
Linda, please, dear God,
don't leave me.

15:15.807 --> 15:16.822
Ginny, we can handle this.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.491
Linda, if you leave, I will die.

15:18.643 --> 15:20.901
-I will die.
-Aah, this is a nightmare.

15:20.995 --> 15:21.902
-What?
-Nothing.

15:21.996 --> 15:24.497
Oh, no.
(panting)

15:24.649 --> 15:25.648
Is it over?

15:25.667 --> 15:27.241
Intermission.
What happened to you?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.076
-Are-are your knees bleeding?
-Yes.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.244
I'm worried about you, Bob.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.504
Did you go around
and see what life

15:31.598 --> 15:33.264
would've been like
if you had never been born

15:33.416 --> 15:34.915
and someone punched you
and threw you out of a bar

15:35.009 --> 15:36.659
and then you jumped in a river?

15:36.752 --> 15:38.085
-It was a little like that.
-Well, that's actually better

15:38.104 --> 15:39.178
than what's been happening here.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.664
My ears feel like
your knees look.

15:41.683 --> 15:42.923
Please, take your seats.

15:43.001 --> 15:44.850

15:50.766 --> 15:52.599
