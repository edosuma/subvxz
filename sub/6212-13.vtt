WEBVTT

00:02.469 --> 00:04.238
Oh, my, how on Earth

00:04.238 --> 00:06.273
do you find anything
in this mess?

00:06.273 --> 00:07.808
I know my homework
looks disorganized

00:07.808 --> 00:09.510
but I have a logical system.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.545
What part of your
logical homework system

00:11.545 --> 00:13.480
is a coupon
for Popeye's Chicken?

00:13.480 --> 00:15.983
Well, um... I am a chicken

00:15.983 --> 00:17.651
when it comes
to taking science tests

00:17.651 --> 00:19.286
so what better bookmark to have

00:19.286 --> 00:21.455
than a chicken coupon?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.724
Ooh-- ten pieces for $7.99.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.660
Sabrina, I need
to get you organized.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.896
You'll need dividers,
colored markers

00:28.896 --> 00:32.933
accordion file, label maker
and a jumbo paper clip.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.668
I have everything upstairs.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.738
You are so lucky you came to me.

00:37.738 --> 00:38.705
Some people win the lottery.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.575
I have an aunt who
collects office supplies.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.010
Hi, Sabrina.
What are you doing?

00:43.010 --> 00:44.344
I just came over
to ask Aunt Zelda

00:44.344 --> 00:45.846
for some help with
my physiology homework

00:45.846 --> 00:47.614
and she decided I need
to get organized.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.483
She went upstairs
for supplies.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.085
Quick-- I'll distract her
while you make your getaway.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.422
Aunt Hilda, is it just me or
have you noticed that Aunt
Zelda's

00:55.422 --> 00:57.291
just a tad compulsive.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.358
A <i>tad?</i>

00:58.358 --> 00:59.893
She rearranged my sock drawer

00:59.893 --> 01:02.262
according to country of origin.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.397
Doesn't that bug you?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.231
Oh, sure.

01:04.231 --> 01:07.534
You just have to find
little ways to amuse yourself.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.469
Watch this.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.373
Okay, I think we
have everything we...

01:13.373 --> 01:15.208
something's wrong.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.578
This room is totally
out of balance.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.412
No, it isn't.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.547
Sabrina, is anything
out of balance?

01:20.547 --> 01:22.349
Only Aunt Zelda.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.557
( <i>sighing</i> )

01:30.557 --> 01:30.955

BARNEY:
Have you got
everything straight?

02:12.299 --> 02:14.067
GOMER:
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you sure?

02:14.067 --> 02:17.170
Don't worry, Barn--
anybody does any

02:17.170 --> 02:20.240
I'll nab em' and slap em'

02:20.240 --> 02:23.443
That's not number one,
that's number two!

02:23.443 --> 02:25.412
One, two!

02:26.179 --> 02:27.214
Can someone
explain to me

02:27.214 --> 02:28.682
why we've stayed
up till 4:00 in
the morning

02:28.682 --> 02:30.751
to watch 12
continuous hours
of <i>Andy Griffith?</i>

02:30.751 --> 02:33.553
Because Mayberry
is a microcosm

02:33.553 --> 02:34.688
of the human condition.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.690
How does the insecure
Barney cope

02:36.690 --> 02:38.592
working in the shadow
of an icon like Andy?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.127
What <i>are</i> the
long-term effects

02:40.127 --> 02:42.229
of Opie growing up without
his two front teeth?

02:42.229 --> 02:44.097
And did Aunt Bee
never marry

02:44.097 --> 02:46.733
because she secretly
worked for the CIA?

02:47.067 --> 02:49.269
I just like watching Gomer
and Goober.

02:50.871 --> 02:51.805
All I know is
I've got a Psych test at 8:30.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.840
I'm going to sleep.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.976
Hey, everybody. What's going on?

02:55.976 --> 02:57.177
We've all got class
in the morning.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.278
We're going to bed.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.180
<i>Before</i> sunrise?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.149
As your R.A., I am
very disappointed

03:02.149 --> 03:03.617
in your lack
of college spirit.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.551
You have a point.

03:04.551 --> 03:05.752
I mean,if I wanted to live
by the rules

03:05.752 --> 03:06.820
I'd be at home
with my Aunt Zelda

03:06.820 --> 03:08.588
helping her
color-code
the condiments.

03:09.022 --> 03:15.529
Yeah, that's true. We're adults
now. We can be spontaneous, do
whatever we want.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.663
Tonight...

03:16.663 --> 03:18.131
I'm not putting
the toilet seat down.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.233
ALL:
Oh, yes you are.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.068
I say we hit an all-night diner

03:21.068 --> 03:22.703
for corn dogs and curly fries.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.937
Ooh, and then
we can go down
to the docks

03:23.937 --> 03:25.839
and have some
clam chowder with
the longshoremen.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.809
Soup and guys
that smell
like fish?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.377
I'm in.
Let's go.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.479
Morgan?

03:32.479 --> 03:33.180
Oh, no thanks.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.848
I've got class in the morning.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.655
Oh, no!

03:41.655 --> 03:43.290
This is so much fun.

03:43.290 --> 03:47.461
I can't believe I waited
200 years to redo our floors.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.162
Hey!

03:49.162 --> 03:50.864
When you tried to
remodel our last house

03:50.864 --> 03:54.067
the drawbridge collapsed
and we were castle-bound
for weeks.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.303
You and Lancelot
weren't exactly complaining.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.605
Well, I had to do something
to occupy my time.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.674
Zellie, rest assured--

04:00.674 --> 04:02.175
this time is going
to be different.

04:02.175 --> 04:02.709
First of all

04:02.709 --> 04:04.377
I have a kick-butt
power tool

04:04.377 --> 04:06.713
and a new-fangled
invention called...

04:06.713 --> 04:08.882
electricity!

04:09.549 --> 04:11.585
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.787
Trust me, I know
what I'm doing.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.788
Whoo!

04:14.788 --> 04:16.189
Oh, Lord!

04:17.457 --> 04:19.726
And I know
what <i>I'm</i> doing.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.096
Aunt Zelda, what are you
doing here so early?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.532
Early? It's 4:00
in the afternoon.

04:25.532 --> 04:25.966
I knew that.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.300
I meant, what
are you doing here

04:27.300 --> 04:28.702
so early in the year?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.004
I mean it could snow,
you could catch cold...

04:31.004 --> 04:32.706
but I see you brought
extra clothes.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.074
Why'd you bring
extra clothes?

04:34.074 --> 04:36.109
Hilda broke the house.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.313
Look-- I see you've been
pulling an all-nighter.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.682
Oh, I remember those days.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.785
What were you studying?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.386
Gomer and Goober?

04:46.386 --> 04:49.322
I'm not that familiar
with the German philosophers.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.158
Anyway, your
Aunt Hilda--

04:51.158 --> 04:52.459
the human
wrecking ball--

04:52.459 --> 04:54.661
is on a home
remodeling binge.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.296
Do you mind if
I stay with you?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.098
Oh, not all.

04:58.098 --> 04:58.799
For how long?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.500
Oh, just
a few days.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.034
A few days--

05:01.034 --> 05:03.703
that's so much more
than one day.

05:03.703 --> 05:04.638
Well, I thought
it would be fun

05:04.638 --> 05:06.606
to spend some time
with my favorite niece.

05:06.606 --> 05:07.674
That is, if she wants me.

05:07.674 --> 05:08.809
Oh, of course I want you.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.743
You know, it's just...

05:09.743 --> 05:12.045
my roommates might feel
a little weird about it.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.814
They kind of like to hang loose.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.081
No problem.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.517
I'm the original
"hang loose" gal.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.753
I just love to
go with the flow, you know?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.054
Kick back...

05:21.054 --> 05:22.589
chill out...

05:22.589 --> 05:25.091
scour and disinfect.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.127
Good thing I brought
my cleaning supplies.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.696
You travel with
cleaning supplies?

05:29.696 --> 05:31.064
Oh, I guess
you do.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.933
Just the essentials.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.269
And they're all
monogrammed, too.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.173
You know, when
I went to school

05:40.173 --> 05:41.708
we didn't study
like <i>that.</i>

05:41.708 --> 05:43.076
We sat at
a table...

05:43.076 --> 05:44.911
treated our
books with <i>care...</i>

05:44.911 --> 05:46.179
and prayed that the students

05:46.179 --> 05:48.982
who'd used them before us
hadn't died of the plague.

05:48.982 --> 05:49.983
You know, Aunt Zelda

05:49.983 --> 05:51.685
things today
are a little different.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.752
I know

05:52.752 --> 05:54.287
and I don't have
a problem with that

05:54.287 --> 05:54.988
because I'm a...

05:54.988 --> 05:56.890
..."hang-loose" gal.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.425
You really don't have
to keep saying that.

05:58.425 --> 06:01.461
Fine. I'll just
whip up some dinner.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.764
Let's see what
you have.

06:04.764 --> 06:09.336
Hmm. Diet soda, nail polish,
and batteries.

06:09.336 --> 06:12.205
That should make
quite a casserole.

06:12.205 --> 06:12.906
BOTH:
Hi.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.741
Hey, guys, listen--
my aunt's going to

06:14.741 --> 06:16.443
stay here for a few days
if it's okay with you.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.544
Oh, it'll be great.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.146
You can never have enough
adult supervision.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.748
And I can say that
with a big smile

06:21.748 --> 06:22.949
because I have
a room of my own

06:22.949 --> 06:24.751
on a whole
different floor.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.920
See ya.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.721
Well, I guess
you did

06:27.721 --> 06:29.256
have me at your
house for Christmas

06:29.256 --> 06:31.625
and as my Uncle Louie
"The Lip" says

06:31.625 --> 06:33.994
"It's time to pay the piper."

06:33.994 --> 06:35.595
Now, don't worry,
girls--

06:35.595 --> 06:37.564
you won't even
know I'm here.

06:37.697 --> 06:41.568
Oh, 10:00--
everybody ready to turn in?

06:41.568 --> 06:43.236
<i>Green Acres</i> is just
about to start.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.170
( <i>Green Acres</i> theme playing)

06:44.170 --> 06:45.672
Ooh, I love
gardening shows.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.873
It's not a
gardening show.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.441
It's about a ditzy
Hungarian socialite

06:48.441 --> 06:50.143
who lives on a farm
with her husband

06:50.143 --> 06:51.845
and a pig
named Arnold.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.346
You know,
it wouldn't
hurt you girls

06:53.346 --> 06:54.481
to try to nourish
your minds

06:54.481 --> 06:57.050
with something
a little more
educational.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.518
We've been nourishing
our minds all day.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.253
We need a funny pig.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.688
But there's
a wonderful
production

07:01.688 --> 07:03.423
of <i>Die Fleidermaus</i>
on PBS.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.992
♪ New York is where
I'd rather stay... ♪

07:05.992 --> 07:07.894
( <i>man singing German opera</i> )

07:07.894 --> 07:09.462
Ah! Now that's what I call
a <i>basso profundo.</i>

07:09.462 --> 07:11.064
He's no Mr. Ziffle.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.499
I say we take a vote.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.433
Here's my vote--

07:13.433 --> 07:14.801
we let my aunt watch
her Nazi opera here

07:14.801 --> 07:15.969
and we go to
the Student Union

07:15.969 --> 07:17.170
and watch the pig
on the big screen.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.705
Good idea.
Later.

07:18.705 --> 07:19.306
Bye, Aunt Zelda.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.674
Oh, 'bye.

07:20.674 --> 07:25.545
Well, it looks like it's just
you and me, Prince Orlowski.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.952
I dream this dream a lot--

07:31.952 --> 07:35.288
but it usually involves
babydoll pajamas...

07:35.288 --> 07:37.857
and I can't remember
what you're wearing.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.393
Oh, hello, Miles.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.796
I'm going to be staying here
for a few days.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.564
I hope you don't mind.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.966
Me? Yeah.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.068
No-- I mean,
no, no, not at all.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.404
Good. Well, would you
like to sit and watch
<i>Die Fleidermaus</i> with me?

07:51.404 --> 07:53.173
It would be
the high point
of my existence.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.208
You don't still have that
little crush on me, do you?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.010
That? No.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.244
Way... over it.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.380
Gone, like ancient history.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.586
I think I'll go
to my room.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.124
This is a much bigger job
than I thought.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.225
Especially after we add on

08:12.225 --> 08:14.761
the repair work to the floor.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.463
Or, we leave it like it is

08:16.463 --> 08:19.299
and turn the dining room
into a cock-fighting pit.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.800
I know we can get this job done.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.435
It's going to take
a little elbow grease.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.005
I'm a cat. I don't have elbows.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.474
<i>You,</i> on the other hand,
have a magic finger.

Don't you want the satisfaction

08:31.578 --> 08:33.446
of knowing that
we did this ourselves?

08:33.446 --> 08:36.583
No, I want nothing more
than to eat, sleep

08:36.583 --> 08:39.352
and dream
about Mrs. Michael Douglas.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
I don't care what
you and Zelda say.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.190
I am going to make our house
a nicer place to live.

Shh!

08:56.803 --> 08:58.571
I'm ordering a Ginzu knife.

If I act now, they'll throw in

a complete set
of titanium kabob skewers.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.611
And if I act now

09:04.611 --> 09:05.912
I might actually
get some sleep.

Throw in the Gabe Kaplan

09:15.188 --> 09:16.756
Aunt Zelda, I'm
a little confused here.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.591
When I left, you were
watching the opera.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.895
How did you go from
<i>Die Fleidermaus</i> to deboner?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.464
Well, after
the opera ended

09:24.464 --> 09:26.132
I was flipping
through the channels

09:26.132 --> 09:27.634
and that show
came on--

09:27.634 --> 09:29.903
the one with
the Hungarian and the pig?

09:29.903 --> 09:33.573
And before I knew it,
I was laughing myself silly.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.310
Oh, that Gabor gal in
the peignoir, husking corn?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.545
Still tickles me.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.046
That's my
favorite episode.

I can't believe how much
I've been missing.

09:44.017 --> 09:44.851
Sabrina, I know why

09:44.851 --> 09:47.153
you and Roxie
ditched me tonight.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.855
Mm, because you're
a teeny-weeny bit

09:48.855 --> 09:50.890
of an uptight
control freak?

09:50.890 --> 09:52.192
I was.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.094
But that's about
to change.

09:54.094 --> 09:54.794
And you got
all this

09:54.794 --> 09:56.062
just from watching

10:00.600 --> 10:02.702
every time I wanted
to cut loose

10:02.702 --> 10:05.071
somebody was there
telling me I couldn't.

10:05.071 --> 10:08.241
And usually that
somebody was me.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.309
Well, after all these years

10:09.309 --> 10:11.177
you're finally ready
to pop out of your shell.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.213

You probably don't want me
in the room for this.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.485
I'm going to go.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.120
Well, that's great.
You go, girl.

I mean, Aunt Girl.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.823

Morning, Aunt Zelda.
So, how'd you sleep?

10:29.662 --> 10:30.897
Amazingly well.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.099
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

10:33.099 --> 10:34.534
Oh, breakfast.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.769
The most important meal
of the day.

You can have
anything you want.

Just reach in
and grab

10:39.839 --> 10:41.541

that appeals to you.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.576
Oh, I couldn't.

Dare I?

10:46.279 --> 10:47.780
You must, unless
you want to go back

10:47.780 --> 10:49.082
to being your
old uptight self.

10:49.082 --> 10:49.582
Never.

sound cool enough

12:29.182 --> 12:30.483
they tell you
where the party is.

varnished herself into a corner.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.323
First of all,
I am not in a corner.

it takes for varnish to dry?

Hilda, if there was ever a time
to use your magic, it's now!

16:03.563 --> 16:07.033
All right, but I did
all the tough part myself.

Well, that solves
that problem.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.075
Why are my feet
sticking to the floor?

nine hours of varnishing.

all night last night
dancing at a rave.

those wild, out-
of-control parties

shut down by the police?

How come you
didn't invite me?

16:31.691 --> 16:32.892
Aunt Hilda,
I'm really worried.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.460

off the deep end.

my very favorite artists.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.196
You've been over to
my Uncle Michelangelo's
parlor in Jersey, huh?

17:10.196 --> 17:11.797
Oh, no.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.799
I was talking about
the Michelangelo

17:13.799 --> 17:15.601
who painted
the Sistine Chapel.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.436
Oh, great.
More competition.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.872
This is Zelda's
first tattoo.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.575
Better late than never.
So, what'd you have in mind?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.610
Can you give me a rendering of

17:24.610 --> 17:27.680
Lucas Cranach the Elder's
<i>Judgment of Paris?</i>

17:27.680 --> 17:31.150
No, but I can give you a rat
that says "Keep on Trucking."

17:31.150 --> 17:31.951
Go ahead,
look around.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.519
See what
you like, babe.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.922
Okay... babe.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.262
Zelda, what
are you doing?

17:43.262 --> 17:44.564
Choosing a tattoo.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.432
And I can assure you,
it won't be of you.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.366
You can't get a tattoo.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.367
It's not your style.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.503
Maybe it wasn't before,
but it is now.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.638
Oh, yeah, your biceps
are just crying out for

17:52.638 --> 17:54.507
"So many chicks,
so little time."

17:54.507 --> 17:56.809
Look, I really don't appreciate
the two of you

17:56.809 --> 17:58.244
interfering in my affairs.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.378
Welcome to my world.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.013
Yo, babe,
you pick one out yet?

18:01.013 --> 18:03.849
Not yet, babe.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.818
I would like for both of you
to leave, now.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.587
We can't leave you here
to ruin your life.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.921
I'm not ruining it.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.924
I'm changing it, and I refuse
to discuss this any further

18:11.924 --> 18:14.193
with a couple
of busybody tattoos.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.930
So, what's it
going to be, babe?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.532
I've made up my mind.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.168
I want that rose,
right over there.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.003
Spooky.

18:24.003 --> 18:27.006
That's the one
Mom picked.

18:28.074 --> 18:28.741
Get ready, babe

18:28.741 --> 18:30.576
'cause this is going
to hurt like hell.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.645
Eh--

18:33.346 --> 18:35.314
Most chicks say
it's not as bad as childbirth.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.517
Well, now that
I'm completely at ease--

18:38.517 --> 18:40.252
ink me, baby.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.823
Something's wrong--
it's not working.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.725
I've never seen
anything like this.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.426
Your skin won't absorb the ink.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.328
That's odd.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.663
That was
a brand-new needle.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.965
Hey, lady, you got
some very weird flesh.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.267
Hey, don't dis
my girl's flesh.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.936
Come on, babe,
we'll try another place.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.270
No.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.273
I should have realized
I couldn't get a tattoo.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.743
You want to get something
pierced instead?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.578
I'm sorry, Vic.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.546
This just isn't
going to work out.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.547
Why not?

19:08.547 --> 19:11.417
'Cause I'm trying
to be something I'm not.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.919
It's not you, it's me.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.588
Good-bye...

19:15.588 --> 19:16.455
babe.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.726
Good-bye, babe.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.929
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.364
So, how's the rib eye
this week?

19:25.364 --> 19:27.266
I'd go with
the porterhouse.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.602
Well, that was
a big waste of time.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.336
It's all my fault.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.338
I only meant to loosen
Aunt Zelda up a little bit.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.040
Instead I turned her
into trailer trash.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.608
Maybe it's not
such a bad thing.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.444
Now I'm the classy one
in the house.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.111
Drat!

19:39.111 --> 19:42.348
We're out of pork rinds
and Ding Dongs.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.749
Aunt Zelda, you're back!

19:43.749 --> 19:45.317
With no visible tattoo.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.986
I didn't get a tattoo.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.688
Oh, so we did
get through to you.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.989
I'm so glad.

19:49.989 --> 19:50.489
It's so nice to know that

19:50.489 --> 19:52.658
I helped my sister
in her time of need.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.860
The needle wouldn't
penetrate my skin.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.496
My witch subconscious wouldn't
allow me to do something

19:57.496 --> 19:59.465
so untrue to myself.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.366
Same thing happened to me

20:00.366 --> 20:02.301
when I tried to become
a nutritionist.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.770
I guess I'm just condemned
for all eternity

20:04.770 --> 20:07.973
to be a beautiful,
uptight genius.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.241
Give yourself a hundred years.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.377
You won't be so beautiful.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.179
Thank you
so very much.

20:13.179 --> 20:16.048
Aunt Zelda, you're
not condemned to be uptight.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.116
Your subconscious
didn't stop you

20:17.116 --> 20:19.552
from eating Gummi Bears
and an eight-day-old meatball.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.654
No, I guess it didn't.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.755
See, you can loosen up.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.457
You just have to stay true
to who you are.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.058
You're right, Sabrina.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.661
Thanks to you, I can
still be a hang-loose gal.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.563
Ow!

20:30.563 --> 20:31.597
Of course you can.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.666
Now, want to go out
and get some breakfast?

20:33.666 --> 20:34.900
Now?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.569
Shouldn't you
be getting ready for class?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.205
And by the way, Sabrina,
if you keep up that
partying all night

20:39.205 --> 20:41.140
you are going
to flunk out of college.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.342
So much for hanging loose.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.376
Welcome back, Aunt Zelda.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.779
SALEM:
Help, cat stuck in varnish!

20:46.779 --> 20:49.115
On second thought,
breakfast sounds good.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.391
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

20:59.391 --> 21:01.360
One of us should
really get that.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.795
Yeah, one of us should.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.064
The youngest
or the closest?

21:05.064 --> 21:07.566
I can't make such
a big decision right now.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.602
Let's wait till
the next commercial.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.170
Oh, I'll get it.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.838
Come in!

21:12.838 --> 21:13.606
Hi!

21:13.606 --> 21:15.207
Oh, no, not again.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.242
Oh, relax.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.476
I'm not moving in.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.844
I just came by
to drop off

21:18.844 --> 21:22.314
a little thank-you
gift from Zelda.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.116
Oh, a suitcase
full of raw meat.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.384
That's so thoughtful.

21:25.384 --> 21:26.752
And so marbled.

21:26.752 --> 21:27.753
I'm keeping
the T-bone. Bye!
