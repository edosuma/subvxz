- No can do.

01:11.325 --> 01:12.492

01:13.517 --> 01:16.506
- Don't push my buttons Bridger.

01:16.506 --> 01:19.666
I run this house not you, not your mama.

01:19.666 --> 01:22.437
Now give me that remote now!

Get down there, pick it up.

01:29.445 --> 01:30.366
- Get off me.

01:30.366 --> 01:31.973
- Now pick it up!

01:31.973 --> 01:32.806
Pick it up!

01:32.806 --> 01:33.639

01:34.546 --> 01:36.226
Stop, don't be, stop.

01:36.226 --> 01:37.527
- Get off of me!

01:37.527 --> 01:38.677
Pick that up!

01:38.677 --> 01:39.510

01:41.687 --> 01:43.221

(thuds)

01:43.221 --> 01:44.195

01:44.195 --> 01:46.445
(coughing)

01:47.367 --> 01:49.394
Hey, you okay, you with me?

01:49.394 --> 01:52.738
Come on, come on, hey, hey, are you okay?

01:52.738 --> 01:53.686
- Yeah.

01:53.686 --> 01:55.703

01:55.703 --> 01:56.620
Go, go, go.

01:57.946 --> 01:58.779
Go.

(engine running)

02:27.018 --> 02:27.851
Bridger!

02:29.338 --> 02:32.255
(tires screeching)

02:44.639 --> 02:47.806
- I'm sorry, I should have been there.

02:49.228 --> 02:50.686
I mean for once I just wanna find

02:50.686 --> 02:53.103
someone who treats you right.

02:54.487 --> 02:56.287
- Me to mom.

02:56.287 --> 03:00.253
- Well, you know what they
say, the right kinda love

03:00.253 --> 03:01.949
- Lasts a life time.
- Lasts a life time.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.782
- I know.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.970
I hope we both find it someday.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.970
- So do I baby, so do I.

03:10.970 --> 03:12.951
- Hey how much money do we have saved up?

03:12.951 --> 03:14.869
- Check my purse.

03:14.869 --> 03:18.119
There's not much, Earl kept finding it.

03:21.111 --> 03:22.278
- 197 dollars.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.540
- I know it's your dream to see the ocean

03:25.540 --> 03:26.719
but I don't think that's gonna be

03:26.719 --> 03:28.969
enough money for gas money.

03:30.770 --> 03:34.246
- Don't worry mom we'll make it.

03:34.246 --> 03:35.246
- Always do.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.130
- I know.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.713
(upbeat music)

03:57.204 --> 03:58.871
- Hey, hey, hey, no.

04:01.621 --> 04:02.541
- Ow.

04:02.541 --> 04:05.490
(upbeat music)

04:05.490 --> 04:06.819
- Are you moving that?

04:06.819 --> 04:08.061

04:36.388 --> 04:39.555
It's kinda dry but I like the mustard.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.018
You can have the rest.

05:25.197 --> 05:26.967
- I adjusted the carburetor.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.506
Should do the trick for now but I really

05:28.506 --> 05:30.997
don't know how much
longer she's gonna last.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.287
How much money do we have?

05:32.287 --> 05:34.454
- 16 dollars and 22 cents.

05:36.025 --> 05:38.175
- We are never going to make it on that.

05:38.175 --> 05:39.457

Come on.

06:23.669 --> 06:25.229
Come on!

06:25.229 --> 06:26.729
Somebody, help me!

06:29.207 --> 06:30.040
Bridger!

06:30.040 --> 06:32.123
(sirens)

06:33.544 --> 06:34.952
- That's it.

06:34.952 --> 06:36.452
Some deep breaths.

06:40.862 --> 06:43.018
He needs to go to the hospital for an EKG.

06:43.018 --> 06:43.851
- [Helen] Okay.

06:43.851 --> 06:45.493
- No I'm fine.

06:45.493 --> 06:46.544
- [Helen] No you're not Bridger,

06:46.544 --> 06:47.784
you need to go to the hospital.

06:47.784 --> 06:51.324
- Mom, I'm fine this is all I need.

06:51.324 --> 06:52.157
I promise.

06:53.253 --> 06:54.624
- Can't make you go but you really

06:54.624 --> 06:57.374
should for preventative measures.

06:59.304 --> 07:04.053
- [Helen] I think we're
fine, thank y'all very much.

07:04.053 --> 07:07.303
- So your truck is pretty much totaled.

07:11.693 --> 07:14.301
- How much do we owe you for the tow?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.468
- 150 for the extra miles,

07:17.525 --> 07:18.365
but I won't charge you for that,

07:18.365 --> 07:21.820
just give me a 100 even
and we call it square.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.645
- I'm really sorry but we just don't

07:23.645 --> 07:26.405
have that kind of money right now and um.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.238
- Here.

07:29.045 --> 07:30.813
You have the money in there right?

07:30.813 --> 07:31.646
- Ya.

07:34.096 --> 07:37.263
- Here 16 bucks and, thanks, meteorol.

07:41.773 --> 07:43.271
- But maybe we can do
something around your shop,

07:43.271 --> 07:45.002
Bridger is great with an engine

07:45.002 --> 07:48.419
and I can get the grease off of anything.

07:50.899 --> 07:53.037
- Where are you folks from?

07:53.037 --> 07:54.832
- Chesterfield Missouri.

07:54.832 --> 07:57.261
- You're a long way from home.

07:57.261 --> 07:58.266
- We're not going back there, it's just

07:58.266 --> 07:59.451
the truck and your clothes,

07:59.451 --> 08:01.016
that's pretty much all we've got.

08:01.016 --> 08:01.994
We're were heading for the coast

08:01.994 --> 08:05.666
it's Bridger's dream to see the ocean.

08:05.666 --> 08:06.792
- I'm Will.

08:06.792 --> 08:07.873
- Helen.

08:07.873 --> 08:09.764
That's my son Bridger.

08:09.764 --> 08:11.764
- It's nice to meet you.

08:13.012 --> 08:15.054
You've got two or three
hundred in scrap weight here,

08:15.054 --> 08:16.421
if you take it to a yard the nearest

08:16.421 --> 08:18.812
ones just a little over
100 miles east of here.

08:18.812 --> 08:21.252
- Would you consider
taking that as payment?

08:21.252 --> 08:25.422
- Oh I can't do that, I
don't get out way to often.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.441
Only when I need a part.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.941
Cost me half that much in gas.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.215
- Yeah.

08:34.563 --> 08:36.897
- Tell you what, tows on me.

08:40.861 --> 08:41.695
- Really?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.611
- Don't worry about it.

08:47.220 --> 08:51.433
- Alright, is there some
sort of motel around here.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.444
- Not on 16 dollars a night.

08:53.444 --> 08:56.027
(gentle music)

09:16.572 --> 09:18.191
- Beautiful place.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.191
- It's home.

09:20.572 --> 09:22.628
That's my daughter Clover.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.849
She's kinda shy till you get to know her.

09:25.849 --> 09:28.593
Well follow me, I'll show
you to your quarters.

09:28.593 --> 09:30.247
- Our quarters?

09:30.247 --> 09:31.330
Sounds fancy.

09:32.192 --> 09:36.275
- That's not exactly the
word that comes to mind.

09:42.993 --> 09:44.873
I apologize for the clutter.

09:44.873 --> 09:46.930
Hasn't been used in a number of years.

09:46.930 --> 09:49.052
- We are very grateful
for your hospitality

09:49.052 --> 09:52.684
and this isn't nothing a
little elbow grease can't fix.

09:52.684 --> 09:54.108
- Well I'll go get some cleaning supplies

09:54.108 --> 09:56.164
and hook up the electricity and

09:56.164 --> 09:58.687
the stove and the fridge
should work just fine.

09:58.687 --> 09:59.748
- Great.

09:59.748 --> 10:02.581
(dramatic music)

10:15.246 --> 10:16.406
(horse whines)

10:16.406 --> 10:19.156
(dramatic music)

10:28.428 --> 10:33.028
- Excuse me Mr. Sims,
where'd you like this stuff.

10:33.028 --> 10:34.217
- Over by the trash can.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.967
(dramatic music)

11:16.364 --> 11:18.754
I'm tired, you doing okay?

11:18.754 --> 11:19.587
- Yeah.

11:21.975 --> 11:23.735
You're a good due to pay.

11:23.735 --> 11:24.818
- Thanks mom.

11:25.964 --> 11:28.381
(cluttering)

11:38.834 --> 11:40.514
- It's delicious.

11:40.514 --> 11:42.314
- [Bridger] Yeah, thank you.

11:42.314 --> 11:43.564
- Your welcome.

11:44.743 --> 11:46.935
I can't take all the credit.

11:46.935 --> 11:50.602
Clover does most of the
cooking around here.

11:53.503 --> 11:55.086
- May I be excused?

11:56.895 --> 11:57.728
- Sure.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.935
Clear any dishes please.

12:10.458 --> 12:11.458
I apologize.

12:12.903 --> 12:17.583
It's nothing personal it's
just been a really rough year.

12:17.583 --> 12:21.333
- She's very polite,
she's a very sweet girl.

12:22.814 --> 12:27.306
- Her mother passed away
when she was little.

12:27.306 --> 12:29.889
It's been her and I ever since.

12:34.476 --> 12:36.684
You can stay here as long as you like.

12:36.684 --> 12:37.924
- That's very nice of you,
we'll just stay as long

12:37.924 --> 12:39.883
as it takes me to raise
the money for a car

12:39.883 --> 12:43.050
and rent of course, I gotta get a job.

12:44.383 --> 12:46.676
- I can take you to town
tomorrow on my way to work.

12:46.676 --> 12:48.396
I think there are some
stores that are hiring.

12:48.396 --> 12:50.114
- Any restaurants?

12:50.114 --> 12:52.727
- Yeah, a friend of mine
owns a diner here in town,

12:52.727 --> 12:55.417
I'll put in a good word for you.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.417
- Thank you.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.578
- And I know it's kinda late
in the school year Bridger

12:59.578 --> 13:00.959
but, there's a high school here

13:00.959 --> 13:03.687
in town if you're interested.

13:03.687 --> 13:07.854
- Sure, I mean I know my
mom wants me to graduate.

13:09.047 --> 13:10.536
- Clover and her friends
meet here about seven o'clock

13:10.536 --> 13:12.898
in the morning, you can
catch a ride with them.

13:12.898 --> 13:15.065
- [Bridger] I'll be ready.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.000
- Oh here.

13:18.599 --> 13:20.050
I'll help you.

13:20.050 --> 13:20.883
- Alright.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.898
- You wanna dry?

13:22.898 --> 13:27.065
(laughing)
(chattering)

13:31.359 --> 13:33.276
- Be very, very, quiet.

13:34.777 --> 13:36.444
I'm hunting rabbits.

13:37.595 --> 13:39.544
- Bo, if the coach finds out we're

13:39.544 --> 13:42.112
checking we're gonna get
kicked off the football team.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.279
- Oh, if coach finds out we
kicked off the football team.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.411
- Drink up.

13:50.819 --> 13:52.508
- [Guy] Hey toss me one of those?

13:52.508 --> 13:54.163
- Oh.

13:54.163 --> 13:55.904
- Good toss.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.464
(gun fires)

13:57.464 --> 13:58.974
- Dude, not funny.

13:58.974 --> 14:01.344
Stop pointing around, that's
dangerous, hold the barrel up.

14:01.344 --> 14:02.961
- Shut up.

14:02.961 --> 14:03.944
- I wanna go home.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.224
- No, we have to see the caves first.

14:06.224 --> 14:08.769
- Leave her alone, don't worry Clover

14:08.769 --> 14:10.682
there's nothing out here to be afraid of.

14:10.682 --> 14:11.607
(laughing)

14:11.607 --> 14:12.440
- Just me.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.077
- Give me the gun Bo,
you're gonna hurt someone.

14:19.077 --> 14:19.910
Give me the gun.

14:19.910 --> 14:20.743
- [Guy With Gun] No.

14:20.743 --> 14:23.368
(yelling)

14:23.368 --> 14:24.408
(gun fires)

14:24.408 --> 14:26.227
(screams)

14:26.227 --> 14:28.977
(dramatic music)

14:54.935 --> 14:58.004
(door creaks)

14:58.004 --> 14:58.837
- Clover?

15:12.025 --> 15:13.192
I'm here baby.

15:18.505 --> 15:21.588
- How cold anyone ever love me daddy?

15:22.727 --> 15:24.362
Look at me, I'm ugly.

15:24.362 --> 15:26.445
(crying)

15:27.926 --> 15:31.676
- The right hearts gonna
find you, I promise.

15:33.764 --> 15:35.132
- Dad.

15:35.132 --> 15:37.215

15:47.494 --> 15:49.604
- Well ya got any
experience as a waitress?

15:49.604 --> 15:52.564

15:52.564 --> 15:53.484
I can work the front of the house,

15:53.484 --> 15:54.716
I can work the back of the house,

15:54.716 --> 15:56.945

15:56.945 --> 15:58.324
- That sounds good.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.264
When can you start?

16:00.264 --> 16:02.681
- Is right now to soon?

16:02.681 --> 16:06.204
- I like you already, I'm Stan,
I'm the owner of this joint.

16:06.204 --> 16:07.425
- Hey Stan, I'm Helen.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.924
- Okay and we got an apron
in the back with your

16:08.924 --> 16:10.356
name on it so you wanna come back there,

16:10.356 --> 16:12.625

hand written tickets,

16:12.625 --> 16:13.945

16:13.945 --> 16:15.084
- That sounds good to me.

16:15.084 --> 16:15.917
- Alright.

16:15.917 --> 16:18.772
- Alight so I guess I'll see you later.

16:18.772 --> 16:19.682
- Glad it worked out.

16:19.682 --> 16:20.515
- Thanks.

16:23.002 --> 16:25.752
(dramatic music)

16:37.013 --> 16:38.821
(honks)

16:38.821 --> 16:41.571
(dramatic music)

16:48.217 --> 16:50.384
(honking)

17:01.909 --> 17:04.708
- She's gonna make me late
for bird watching again.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.040
- Bird watching?

17:07.419 --> 17:09.858
- There she is, get in the back.

17:09.858 --> 17:10.692
- Alright.

17:10.692 --> 17:11.525
- Go.

17:11.525 --> 17:12.525
- I'm going.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.127
- What took?

17:22.898 --> 17:23.896
- Sorry.

17:23.896 --> 17:26.298
- You know Albert sometimes
it takes ladies a little time

17:26.298 --> 17:27.859
in the morning to get ready.

17:27.859 --> 17:29.719
- Mister president, shut it.

17:29.719 --> 17:32.465
- Can we just go please?

17:32.465 --> 17:34.048
- Anything for you.

17:37.450 --> 17:38.925
Listen to this bad boy.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.675
(engine running)

17:49.162 --> 17:51.412
(laughing)

17:53.092 --> 17:57.259
It's not funny, I'll have you
know this car is a classic,

17:58.202 --> 18:00.338
I could sell it for top dollar to

18:00.338 --> 18:02.200
any collector in the world.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.320
- [Back Seat] Okay.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.737
- It's the truth.

18:06.617 --> 18:07.575
(bangs)

18:07.575 --> 18:08.610
- Ow!

18:08.610 --> 18:11.109
- You guys are like my only real friends.

18:11.109 --> 18:14.276
- Friends, keep telling yourself that.

18:16.981 --> 18:17.898
Who's that?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.672
- Just some stray my dad
picked up on the side

18:20.672 --> 18:22.872
of the road, can you just drive please?

18:22.872 --> 18:24.762
- He looks like a weirdo.

18:24.762 --> 18:25.595
- And we don't?

18:25.595 --> 18:26.661
- Can we just drive?

18:26.661 --> 18:27.494
Please?

18:35.653 --> 18:38.403
(dramatic music)

18:48.482 --> 18:50.562
- [Bike] How's it going?

18:50.562 --> 18:51.395
- Hey.

18:52.453 --> 18:57.412
- Correct me if I'm wrong
but yo look a little lost.

18:57.412 --> 18:58.245
- Yeah.

18:58.245 --> 19:00.528
- Okay well where ya headed.

19:00.528 --> 19:02.869
- Where ever the high school is.

19:02.869 --> 19:05.853
- Hop on, I'll give you a lift.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.373
- How do I know you're not
some serial killer freak?

19:08.373 --> 19:10.451
- Wow you come up with that by yourself?

19:10.451 --> 19:11.284
It's good.

19:15.002 --> 19:17.184
Wait you're serious?

19:17.184 --> 19:18.182
- Yeah.

19:18.182 --> 19:21.634
- If you just keep walking straight nine,

19:21.634 --> 19:24.354
ten miles the school's up on the left.

19:24.354 --> 19:25.874
Can't miss it.

19:25.874 --> 19:26.707
Good luck.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.535
- Alright, I'll take a ride.

19:33.691 --> 19:35.154
- Okay, here you go.

19:35.154 --> 19:36.594
- I'm not wearing that.

19:36.594 --> 19:40.011
- You're gonna wear this or keep walking.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.531
(whirring)

19:53.124 --> 19:55.504
- I'll give ya 100 bucks for it.

19:55.504 --> 19:58.202
- Come on Murphy there's
at least 300 in scrap here.

19:58.202 --> 19:59.902
- I gotta make a living.

19:59.902 --> 20:02.453
- But it's for a good cause.

20:02.453 --> 20:04.757
- Cry me a river, 150.

20:04.757 --> 20:06.191
- 250.

20:06.191 --> 20:08.301
- 200 or you can drag this hunk of junk

20:08.301 --> 20:10.140
back to the garage where it came from.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.293
- Done.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.832
- Highway robbery if you ask me.

20:13.832 --> 20:14.665
- There's a tender heart underneath

20:14.665 --> 20:16.592
that thick skin after all Murph.

20:16.592 --> 20:19.413
- Just get outta here
before I change my mind.

20:19.413 --> 20:21.859
- I'm gone, thanks Murph,
catch ya next time.

20:21.859 --> 20:23.541
- Every body thinks I got money,

20:23.541 --> 20:27.708
I aint got no money, what the
hells the matter with them?

20:41.037 --> 20:42.973
- Hey, thank you for the ride.

20:42.973 --> 20:44.346
- No problem.

20:44.346 --> 20:45.929
- It's a nice bike.

20:47.341 --> 20:49.045
- It's definitely a rebuild,

20:49.045 --> 20:52.448
the engine needs an overhaul, bad.

20:52.448 --> 20:54.281
- It's 74 Honda right?

20:55.239 --> 20:57.178
- Take it you're into motor cycles?

20:57.178 --> 20:59.978
- Yeah, if I had the money I would be.

20:59.978 --> 21:01.227
- I didn't catch your name.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.447
- I'm Bridger.

21:02.447 --> 21:03.280
- It's nice to meet you.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.309
- Nice to meet you to.

21:04.309 --> 21:07.008
- I'm Roman, let me introduce
you to misses Collins.

21:07.008 --> 21:08.175
She's awesome.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.349
- Here's your schedule,

21:12.349 --> 21:15.778
first period started about 30 minutes ago.

21:15.778 --> 21:16.824
- Thanks.

21:16.824 --> 21:18.157
- [Lady] Uh huh.

21:25.039 --> 21:25.968
- What?

21:25.968 --> 21:27.317
What's wrong?

21:27.317 --> 21:28.650
- This is cruel.

21:30.728 --> 21:32.509
- I'm not contributing to

21:32.509 --> 21:34.955
the mass murder of all these frogs.

21:34.955 --> 21:37.568
- Yeah well, you kinda have to other

21:37.568 --> 21:39.706
wise we're gonna get an F so.

21:39.706 --> 21:40.720
Just grab a scalpel and.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.970
- I don't care.

21:42.893 --> 21:44.399
- I don't care either.

21:44.399 --> 21:46.115
Aren't you supposed to be bird watching?

21:46.115 --> 21:47.755
This isn't even your class.

21:47.755 --> 21:52.008
- Well Clover needed my help
of course and Mr. Clark,

21:52.008 --> 21:55.899
he doesn't even know I'm here
so mind your own bees wax.

21:55.899 --> 21:56.732
- Sorry.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.565
- Scalpel.

22:03.507 --> 22:04.787
I thought you said you quit.

22:04.787 --> 22:05.620
- I did.

22:06.635 --> 22:09.626
- Well it didn't look like that.

22:09.626 --> 22:10.459
I'm worried about you.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.292
- Don't.

22:14.606 --> 22:16.296
- Him again.

22:16.296 --> 22:18.213
What does he even want?

22:20.666 --> 22:22.333
Hey, snap out of it.

22:24.115 --> 22:24.966
- What are you talking about.

22:24.966 --> 22:27.915
- You we're staring right at that guy.

22:27.915 --> 22:29.832
- What ever, I was not.

22:34.926 --> 22:37.676
- Clover this surgeon is at work.

22:38.696 --> 22:41.006
Please try and pay attention.

22:41.006 --> 22:43.766
- Even Clover's checking him out.

22:43.766 --> 22:45.078
As if she'd ever had a chance.

22:45.078 --> 22:48.536
- Leave her alone, alright
she's been through enough.

22:48.536 --> 22:50.918
- It's her fault you got
kicked off the football team.

22:50.918 --> 22:52.003
I mean all she had to do was tell

22:52.003 --> 22:54.043
the judge that she saw
Bill holding the gun.

22:54.043 --> 22:55.358
- Look we've been through this okay?

22:55.358 --> 22:56.486
She said that it was dark and

22:56.486 --> 22:57.856
that she didn't remember,

22:57.856 --> 23:00.606
I'm not going to hold that against her.

23:00.606 --> 23:02.216
- She ruined your chance
to play in college.

23:02.216 --> 23:03.998
- It's just football, I'm gonna be fine.

23:03.998 --> 23:05.246
- I stood up for you.

23:05.246 --> 23:09.175
- Well that doesn't mean you
have to treat her so bad.

23:09.175 --> 23:10.758
- Don't talk to me.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.409
(gentle music)

23:22.854 --> 23:25.433
- So he's staying at your house?

23:25.433 --> 23:27.203
- No in a trailer.

23:27.203 --> 23:28.643
- For how long?

23:28.643 --> 23:29.893
- I don't know.

23:31.203 --> 23:33.286
- Well that's just great.

23:35.574 --> 23:37.220
- Maybe he's nice.

23:37.220 --> 23:38.637
- Maybe he's not.

23:40.785 --> 23:41.618
- Really?

23:41.618 --> 23:43.812
- Just focus on the frog.

23:43.812 --> 23:47.312
If you couldn't tell there is some sort of

23:47.312 --> 23:51.479
exquisite synergy that's
going on between us right now.

23:52.943 --> 23:54.563
Don't disturb that Edward.

23:54.563 --> 23:55.934
- Yeah, sir, wouldn't want to.

23:55.934 --> 23:56.767
(bell rings)

23:56.767 --> 23:59.229
- Alright that's time kids.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.259
Close your books, leave your frogs.

24:02.259 --> 24:04.426
(chatter)

24:10.848 --> 24:13.431
- Parting is such sweet sorrow,

24:14.981 --> 24:18.148
that's from Romeo and Juliet actually.

24:19.821 --> 24:22.101
What, it's her favorite book.

24:22.101 --> 24:24.518
- No, Pride and Prejudice is.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.938
- Dang it, but I was pretty
close with the Romeo and.

24:28.938 --> 24:31.021
- Not really, I gotta go.

24:32.682 --> 24:33.842
- Stop smiling.

24:33.842 --> 24:36.592
(dramatic music)

24:44.341 --> 24:45.712
- Are you kidding me?

24:45.712 --> 24:46.669
Who is that?

24:46.669 --> 24:47.502
Hey!

24:49.352 --> 24:52.685
What the hell do you think you're doing?

24:53.872 --> 24:55.453
- What does it look like?

24:55.453 --> 24:56.312
I'm helping her with her books.

24:56.312 --> 24:58.002
- Well don't.

24:58.002 --> 25:01.293
You know you should mind
your own business blondey.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.212
I mean I don't even know you

25:03.212 --> 25:06.379
and you don't want to know me so walk.

25:07.636 --> 25:11.803
Are you deaf, I said let scar
face pick up her own mess.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.672
I don't think you understand who I am.

25:23.672 --> 25:27.012
- You picked on girls,
that's all I need to know.

25:27.012 --> 25:28.962
- You know what?

25:28.962 --> 25:32.543
Maybe you're right, you look like a girl.

25:32.543 --> 25:34.802
maybe I should treat you like one.

25:34.802 --> 25:36.682
(laughing)

25:36.682 --> 25:38.877
- What's going on here?

25:38.877 --> 25:40.139
- Oh hey Mr. Williams,

25:40.139 --> 25:43.587
I was just getting to
know my new friend here.

25:43.587 --> 25:46.182
Yeah we were just talking right?

25:46.182 --> 25:47.422
Newbie?

25:47.422 --> 25:48.255
- Right.

25:52.092 --> 25:52.925
- Clover?

25:55.360 --> 25:58.443
You have something you wanna tell me?

25:59.412 --> 26:02.662
- I just accidentally dropped my books.

26:06.910 --> 26:09.892
- Okay, everyone get to class.

26:09.892 --> 26:11.102
Now Bo, go.

26:11.102 --> 26:14.019
- It was good to meet you, see you.

26:20.010 --> 26:22.400
- Pride and Prejudice.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.483
- Yeah, it's stupid it's,

26:26.149 --> 26:29.187
they're making me read it for class.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.432
- I don't think it's stupid at all.

26:31.432 --> 26:33.118
It's actually my favorite book.

26:33.118 --> 26:35.424
(gentle music)

26:35.424 --> 26:36.257
No really.

26:44.275 --> 26:46.304
- Hey, wait up.

26:46.304 --> 26:50.195
That was pretty cool, you
sticking up for Clover like that.

26:50.195 --> 26:52.115
- Somebody had to.

26:52.115 --> 26:55.115
- Not me, nobody stands up to Bo.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.934
You gotta be brave or crazy.

26:56.934 --> 26:58.563
- I just hate bullies.

26:58.563 --> 26:59.824
- Well you're lucky Mr. Williams

26:59.824 --> 27:02.995
showed up otherwise he woulda smashed you.

27:02.995 --> 27:05.664
- Yeah, I'm not very much of a fighter.

27:05.664 --> 27:08.275
- So you know where you're going?

27:08.275 --> 27:09.664
- No not really.

27:09.664 --> 27:10.747
- Let me see.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.155
Shop class with Mr. Williams,

27:15.155 --> 27:18.083
teacher that just stopped
the fight, he's way cool.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.322
- Yeah he picked me up after

27:19.322 --> 27:21.563
you guys left me behind this morning.

27:21.563 --> 27:25.146
- Yeah, listen I'm
really sorry about that.

27:26.115 --> 27:27.094
- It's all good.

27:27.094 --> 27:27.927
- Names Edward by the way.

27:27.927 --> 27:29.392
- I'm Bridger.

27:29.392 --> 27:30.933
- Well I have the same class as you

27:30.933 --> 27:32.421
so I'll show you where to go.

27:32.421 --> 27:33.254
- Oh cool.

27:33.254 --> 27:34.087
(bell rings)

27:34.087 --> 27:35.512
- This way.

27:35.512 --> 27:36.861
- Alright.

27:36.861 --> 27:41.028
Can someone tell me what the
heart of the motorcycle is?

27:43.792 --> 27:45.351
Mister Chinsley?

27:45.351 --> 27:46.512
- My name is Bo.

27:46.512 --> 27:47.672
- Fine, Bo?

27:47.672 --> 27:49.501
- The engine.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.842
- It's not the answer I'm looking for.

27:51.842 --> 27:53.259
Any other takers?

27:55.872 --> 27:56.705
Bridger?

27:56.705 --> 27:58.613
- The carburetor?

27:58.613 --> 27:59.482
- That's correct.

27:59.482 --> 28:00.982
- That's bullshit.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.513
- Get out of my class.

28:07.690 --> 28:08.523
- [Bo] For what?

28:08.523 --> 28:10.100
- Get out of my class Bo.

28:10.100 --> 28:10.933
Now.

28:12.021 --> 28:12.938
- Whatever.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.733
- Okay, alright.

28:21.072 --> 28:23.989
Bridger, what makes this the heart.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.472
- Because it's responsible for

28:26.472 --> 28:29.280
releasing fuel for the
combustion in the engine.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.338
If it's not working
properly then nothing is.

28:32.338 --> 28:34.080
- That's right, it's like blood

28:34.080 --> 28:35.933
pumping through a human heart.

28:35.933 --> 28:36.850
It's vital.

28:39.217 --> 28:43.127
Now I know that most of
you following graduation

28:43.127 --> 28:46.429
will probably be living here
the rest of your lives so in

28:46.429 --> 28:49.368
order for you to survive you
need to know how to fix things.

28:49.368 --> 28:53.206
Our senior class project
is gonna do just that.

28:53.206 --> 28:55.255
We're gonna rebuild the engine of my motor

28:55.255 --> 28:59.005
cycle and we're gonna
start with carburetors.

29:00.157 --> 29:03.567
- [Albert] I would have
done the same exact thing.

29:03.567 --> 29:06.286
- No you wouldn't have,
you're scared of Bo's shadow.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.119
- Am not.

29:07.119 --> 29:08.536
- You are to.

29:08.536 --> 29:10.188
So am I.

29:10.188 --> 29:12.647
Bridger's pretty cool actually.

29:12.647 --> 29:14.980
- Get in the back, hurry go.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.792
- [Edward] Every time.

29:23.499 --> 29:26.159
- You know Clover
waiting for you is just a

29:26.159 --> 29:30.326
pleasure but why is it that
girls always make guys wait?

29:32.039 --> 29:34.359
- So we do I guess.

29:34.359 --> 29:35.889
- Who you looking for?

29:35.889 --> 29:37.220
Oh don't tell me.

29:37.220 --> 29:38.053
Bridger.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.438
- We should give him a
ride back to my house.

29:42.438 --> 29:43.271
- [Edward] Yeah.

29:43.271 --> 29:44.104
- No way.

29:44.104 --> 29:44.937
- Yeah.

29:44.937 --> 29:45.770
- Why.

29:45.770 --> 29:46.628
- He can find his own ride.

29:46.628 --> 29:48.249
- Really?

29:48.249 --> 29:50.416
- Yeah, I don't have room.

29:57.343 --> 29:59.343
(bangs)

30:05.076 --> 30:06.735
- It was.

30:06.735 --> 30:09.045
It was Bridger right?

30:09.045 --> 30:09.996
- Yeah.

30:09.996 --> 30:11.124
- Cool man.

30:11.124 --> 30:12.644
(banging)

30:12.644 --> 30:16.811
If you ever get in my business
again and I will kill you.

30:17.815 --> 30:20.663
(cries out)

30:20.663 --> 30:24.242
It's okay, some people just
have to learn the hard way.

30:24.242 --> 30:25.075
- [Roman] Hey!

30:25.075 --> 30:29.903
- Oh hey Mr. Williams,
hey good talking Bridger.

30:29.903 --> 30:31.236
- What was that?

30:32.140 --> 30:33.507
- Nothing.

30:33.507 --> 30:35.751
- What do you mean nothing?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.147
- I'm fine.

30:37.147 --> 30:40.067
- No, hey, you need a ride?

30:40.067 --> 30:41.317
- [Bridger] No.

30:49.517 --> 30:51.968
- You did real good out there today.

30:51.968 --> 30:53.062
- Thank you.

30:53.062 --> 30:57.968
- Glad to have you on
board, I'll see ya tomorrow.

30:57.968 --> 30:59.385
- Mr. Warrington?

31:02.019 --> 31:02.852
Thank you.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.983
- No thank you, I mean it I mean

31:05.983 --> 31:08.650
a good waitress is hard to find.

31:15.138 --> 31:15.971
- Here.

31:17.114 --> 31:18.757
- What's this?

31:18.757 --> 31:21.924
- I took your truck to the scrap yard.

31:24.218 --> 31:25.256
I know I said I wasn't gonna

31:25.256 --> 31:29.423
but I ended up having to go
that way so it's no big deal.

31:30.746 --> 31:31.913
Hope it helps.

31:33.256 --> 31:35.006
- More than you know.

31:37.808 --> 31:38.641
Thank you.

31:42.254 --> 31:43.106
- Hungry?

31:43.106 --> 31:44.328
- Starved.

31:44.328 --> 31:45.927
- I know this great little barbecue joint,

31:45.927 --> 31:47.356
best ribs you've ever had.

31:47.356 --> 31:49.439
- That sounds good to me.

31:53.225 --> 31:55.975
(dramatic music)

32:02.695 --> 32:05.362
(doors banging)

32:23.602 --> 32:27.514
Oh my gosh that really was the
best barbecue I've ever had.

32:27.514 --> 32:28.347
- Glad you liked it.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.180
- Yeah.

32:30.572 --> 32:32.146
- Here why don't you give that to Bridger,

32:32.146 --> 32:33.671
I'm sure he's hungry.

32:33.671 --> 32:36.279
- You don't think Clover wants it?

32:36.279 --> 32:38.830
- She probably already ate.

32:38.830 --> 32:40.060
- Well he'll love it.

32:40.060 --> 32:40.893
- Good.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.119
- Thank you so much, I
really had a good time.

32:43.119 --> 32:43.952
- Me to.

32:46.967 --> 32:50.231
- I can give you a ride
into work tomorrow.

32:50.231 --> 32:51.547
- You don't mind?

32:51.547 --> 32:53.236
- Not at all.

32:53.236 --> 32:54.776
It's on the way.

32:54.776 --> 32:57.416
- Alright, I'll take you up on it.

32:57.416 --> 32:58.749
Good night will.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.311
- Good night Helen.

33:05.546 --> 33:06.379
- Hey.

33:08.216 --> 33:09.175
Are you okay?

33:09.175 --> 33:10.258
- Just tired.

33:11.718 --> 33:14.507
- Oh my gosh, I had a crazy day

33:14.507 --> 33:16.827
and it was actually kinda good.

33:16.827 --> 33:20.410
That diner is a bit
trashed but it was nice

33:21.705 --> 33:25.134
and then we went to barbecue,
I brought you some home.

33:25.134 --> 33:26.767
How's school.

33:26.767 --> 33:28.958
- I'm not going back.

33:28.958 --> 33:32.266
- What do you mean you're not going back?

33:32.266 --> 33:34.933
- I don't want to talk about it.

33:38.272 --> 33:40.821
- I want you to finish school Bridger.

33:40.821 --> 33:41.654
- I don't.

33:42.522 --> 33:44.910
Mom I hate this place.

33:44.910 --> 33:45.821
Let's just save up enough money

33:45.821 --> 33:48.238
and get the hell out of here.

33:56.682 --> 33:57.515
- Take your pill.

33:57.515 --> 33:58.592
- Where'd you get the money?

33:58.592 --> 34:02.442
- Will was nice enough to take
our truck to the scrap yard.

34:02.442 --> 34:05.192
There's some food if you want it.

34:06.682 --> 34:09.681
I am really sorry you had a bad day.

34:10.914 --> 34:12.414
I love you Bridge.

34:14.935 --> 34:16.101
- Love you to.

34:19.668 --> 34:22.251
(gentle music)

34:53.652 --> 34:54.880
(dramatic music)

34:54.880 --> 34:56.452
(laughing)

34:56.452 --> 34:58.401
(beeping)

34:58.401 --> 35:00.568
(yelling)

35:01.692 --> 35:03.192
- [Helen] Bridger?

35:04.292 --> 35:05.519
Hey Bridger.

35:05.519 --> 35:08.354
(crying)

35:08.354 --> 35:10.415
- Mom what's wrong with me?

35:10.415 --> 35:11.868
- [Helen] What do you mean?

35:11.868 --> 35:14.701
- I feel different, I always have.

35:16.230 --> 35:17.897
- You are different.

35:18.761 --> 35:20.789
You're a miracle.

35:20.789 --> 35:22.956
- No I'm not, I'm a freak.

35:24.553 --> 35:26.970
- Everything's gonna be fine.

35:28.889 --> 35:31.033
Did you take your pill?

35:31.033 --> 35:31.866
- Yeah.

35:33.406 --> 35:35.341
- Right now I want you to get some sleep,

35:35.341 --> 35:38.091
it's late you gotta get up early.

35:39.384 --> 35:40.717
Hey, I love you.

35:42.545 --> 35:43.878
- I love you to.

35:52.644 --> 35:54.061
- kay, goodnight.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.065
- Goodnight.

36:04.124 --> 36:06.291
(honking)

36:17.095 --> 36:20.928
- Wow, you're only ten
minutes late this time.

36:22.855 --> 36:23.772
Thank you.

36:23.772 --> 36:25.735
- Your welcome.

36:25.735 --> 36:27.235
- Where's Bridger.

36:28.533 --> 36:30.853
- Probably still in the trailer.

36:30.853 --> 36:33.135
- [Edward] I think we
should give him a ride.

36:33.135 --> 36:33.968
- [Clover] Me to.

36:33.968 --> 36:34.801
- Why would you say that?

36:34.801 --> 36:35.634
- Why not?

36:37.905 --> 36:38.738
- Nope.

36:39.804 --> 36:42.044
We will not give him a ride.

36:42.044 --> 36:43.235
There is no way.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.494
- Fine, I'll walk.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.494
- So will I.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.417
- Okay, okay.

36:53.664 --> 36:55.841
I'll give him a ride, but Edward,

36:55.841 --> 36:59.924
you are paying me double
for gas money next week.

37:01.577 --> 37:02.410
- If that's what it takes to be

37:02.410 --> 37:05.410
nice to a fellow outsider then fine.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.585
Want me to go get him?

37:09.585 --> 37:11.185
- Please if you don't mind.

37:11.185 --> 37:12.268
- Not at all.

37:17.333 --> 37:18.663
(knocking)

37:18.663 --> 37:19.496
Bridger?

37:20.493 --> 37:21.962
If you're in there, we just wanted

37:21.962 --> 37:25.129
to see if you needed a ride to school.

37:36.063 --> 37:37.253
No answer.

37:37.253 --> 37:38.823
I don't think he's coming.

37:38.823 --> 37:41.490
- I am so completely devastated.

37:42.467 --> 37:43.550
- Okay, cool.

37:45.034 --> 37:47.103
- Easy on my ride okay?

37:47.103 --> 37:48.741
- Can we just go please?

37:48.741 --> 37:50.663
- When we get married this will also be

37:50.663 --> 37:54.830
your car and you will want
to treat it with respect.

37:55.762 --> 37:58.512
(engine running)

38:14.951 --> 38:17.701
(dramatic music)

38:53.613 --> 38:57.780
Edward I cannot say a approve
of the seating arrangement.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.238
- Of course not.

39:02.222 --> 39:03.222
- Thank you.

39:04.288 --> 39:05.121
- Yeah.

39:07.698 --> 39:10.531
(throat clearing)

39:15.138 --> 39:17.048
- She must not know I've arrived.

39:17.048 --> 39:19.078
- I'm sure that's what it is.

39:19.078 --> 39:21.495
(bell rings)

39:22.989 --> 39:23.822
- Want a rubber fry?

39:23.822 --> 39:25.437
- Get outta my face, get outta my face.

39:25.437 --> 39:27.672
- It's disgusting, it's like coal.

39:27.672 --> 39:31.672
- Hey, hey, hey, party
at my house this weekend.

39:33.687 --> 39:35.447
My parents are going outta town okay?

39:35.447 --> 39:36.280
- Hey.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.722
- Sweet.

39:37.722 --> 39:39.305
- What do you want?

39:40.157 --> 39:42.240
- I'm through with Trent.

39:43.075 --> 39:45.075
- Good, it's about time.

39:49.313 --> 39:51.523
- I can't believe he still blames you.

39:51.523 --> 39:52.969
That he would ever forgive that freak.

39:52.969 --> 39:57.136
- It was him, alright, he
grabbed the gun from me.

39:58.011 --> 39:59.221
You saw it.

39:59.221 --> 40:00.554
- Yeah, totally.

40:01.992 --> 40:04.906
All she had to do was
admit that it was him

40:04.906 --> 40:09.073
and you would have rocked
this years quarter back.

40:11.470 --> 40:14.220
(dramatic music)

40:15.280 --> 40:17.634
- He'll get what's coming to him.

40:17.634 --> 40:18.467
Trust me.

40:20.909 --> 40:22.242
And so will she.

40:27.108 --> 40:29.108
- What's so interesting?

40:35.720 --> 40:36.553
Oh great.

40:46.219 --> 40:49.219
- Hey, hey, hey, check out who's coming.

40:49.219 --> 40:51.719
- Check this out, hey Bridger.

40:53.222 --> 40:55.722
Hey man, look I just wanted to

40:59.596 --> 41:03.348
apologize for what happened yesterday.

41:03.348 --> 41:04.681
I'm sorry, cool?

41:11.457 --> 41:14.374
Come on bro don't leave me hanging.

41:17.962 --> 41:19.045
- We're good.

41:20.348 --> 41:21.647
(clatters)

41:21.647 --> 41:23.897
(laughing)

41:27.908 --> 41:29.377
- It's not funny, stop laughing.

41:29.377 --> 41:32.511
- Get over yourself, it's very funny.

41:32.511 --> 41:34.761
(laughing)

41:47.756 --> 41:49.055
- I'm sorry.

41:49.055 --> 41:50.705
- It's okay.

41:50.705 --> 41:52.922
It's not the first time.

41:52.922 --> 41:55.089
(chatter)

42:04.404 --> 42:06.244
- Stop staring!

42:06.244 --> 42:07.865
What is wrong with you people, all you do

42:07.865 --> 42:12.032
is stare at people you disapprove
of what is your problem?

42:13.716 --> 42:14.799
Stop staring!

42:22.927 --> 42:24.260
You're pathetic.

42:28.521 --> 42:30.604
(laughs)

42:36.176 --> 42:38.926
(dramatic music)

42:52.151 --> 42:53.234
Are you okay?

42:55.460 --> 42:56.877
- Yeah, I'm fine.

43:03.220 --> 43:05.929
- I wanted to say thank you

43:05.929 --> 43:08.679
for standing up for me yesterday.

43:10.340 --> 43:12.090
- I guess we're even.

43:15.110 --> 43:17.169
- I thought you were one of them.

43:17.169 --> 43:18.002
- Really?

43:18.920 --> 43:19.753
- Yeah.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.222
But I was wrong.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.392
Sorry for judging you.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.949
You're really different.

43:29.949 --> 43:31.032
- So are you.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.360
- Mister Chinsley.

43:46.940 --> 43:51.596
Look, I know what you're
about okay so I suggest

43:51.596 --> 43:56.457
that you tread lightly or you
and I can sort things out.

43:56.457 --> 43:57.290
Okay?

43:57.290 --> 43:58.708
- Is that a threat?

43:58.708 --> 44:00.791
- No, no, it's a promise.

44:09.719 --> 44:11.297
- [Clover] He must have
left after lunch right?

44:11.297 --> 44:12.708
- [Albert] Well I'm through looking,

44:12.708 --> 44:15.375
you guys have wasted all my gas.

44:16.567 --> 44:19.217
- Hey hey there he is,
pull over, pull over.

44:19.217 --> 44:20.057
- Why should I?

44:20.057 --> 44:20.890
- Because it's

44:20.890 --> 44:22.039
- the right thing to do
- Pull over!

44:22.039 --> 44:22.872
- Albert!

44:25.679 --> 44:26.512
Thank you.

44:37.737 --> 44:38.828
- Are you serious?

44:38.828 --> 44:40.257
- Go back Albert.

44:40.257 --> 44:43.176
- No, he stole you from me.

44:43.176 --> 44:44.576
- What are you talking about?

44:44.576 --> 44:47.167
- You were supposed to
be mine, are you blind?

44:47.167 --> 44:49.767
- We're just friends Albert.

44:49.767 --> 44:53.600
That's all we'll ever
be, do you not see that?

44:54.676 --> 44:55.727
- I do now.

44:55.727 --> 44:58.169
- Good, now will you please go back?

44:58.169 --> 44:59.002
- No.

44:59.002 --> 44:59.959
- Please will you go back Albert.

44:59.959 --> 45:01.575
- No!

45:01.575 --> 45:04.325
(dramatic music)

45:20.105 --> 45:22.272
(panting)

45:28.055 --> 45:31.138
- Hey, Bridger, hey look at me buddy.

45:31.975 --> 45:33.850
What's going on?

45:33.850 --> 45:34.683
- Nothing.

45:36.133 --> 45:37.161
- You okay?

45:37.161 --> 45:38.923
- Yeah, I'm fine.

45:38.923 --> 45:41.256
- Hey, hey, wow, slow, slow.

45:46.141 --> 45:48.823
I don't need to take you
to a hospital or something?

45:48.823 --> 45:49.812
- No.

45:49.812 --> 45:50.895
- You sure?

45:50.895 --> 45:52.449
- Yeah.

45:52.449 --> 45:53.282
I'm fine.

45:54.841 --> 45:56.591
- Get you some water.

46:02.790 --> 46:04.023
Here.

46:04.023 --> 46:04.856
Drink up.

46:10.492 --> 46:13.075
Take it you could use a change?

46:20.310 --> 46:22.060
- I said I was sorry.

46:30.100 --> 46:30.933
- Nice job.

46:30.933 --> 46:32.601
- Don't even talk to me, kay

46:32.601 --> 46:34.331
you're lucky you're even getting a ride.

46:34.331 --> 46:35.748
- What ever dude.

46:36.771 --> 46:39.241
- So that's why she
always covers her face.

46:39.241 --> 46:40.074
- Yeah.

46:41.052 --> 46:43.731
I can't imagine how hard it been on her,

46:43.731 --> 46:47.080
I mean she went through
numerous reconstructive

46:47.080 --> 46:50.997
surgeries to fix the
damage but it left a scar.

46:52.401 --> 46:54.781
In more ways than one.

46:54.781 --> 46:56.948
- I think she's beautiful.

46:58.119 --> 47:01.143
- Well you got a good heart Bridger.

47:01.143 --> 47:04.810
You see things differently
than most people.

47:08.343 --> 47:10.760
Let's get you outta here huh?

47:17.216 --> 47:18.299
- Who's that?

47:24.593 --> 47:26.343
- [Roman] Hey Clover.

47:27.372 --> 47:28.772
- Hey mister Williams.

47:28.772 --> 47:30.272
- Where ya headed?

47:31.321 --> 47:34.601
- I was just coming to see
if Bridger needed a ride.

47:34.601 --> 47:35.601
- Yup, good.

47:37.541 --> 47:40.481
- I'm sorry about Albert that was rude.

47:40.481 --> 47:42.064
I told him to stop.

47:44.783 --> 47:46.033
- I understand.

47:48.972 --> 47:50.389
- So, wanna ride.

This is my secret spot.

48:30.502 --> 48:34.391
Been coming here ever
since I was a little girl.

48:34.391 --> 48:35.808
- It's beautiful.

48:37.087 --> 48:38.200
- You're the first person I've

48:38.200 --> 48:40.783
ever brought here since my dad.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.363
- What's that over there.

48:45.508 --> 48:46.925
- That's my fort.

48:48.199 --> 48:49.949
- Can I check it out.

48:51.079 --> 48:53.162
- I guess, yeah go ahead.

49:01.468 --> 49:03.828
- Did you do this yourself?

49:03.828 --> 49:05.879
- No not at all.

49:05.879 --> 49:10.046
My dad helped me and Donnie
deserves some credit to.

49:11.783 --> 49:12.616
- Donnie?

49:14.770 --> 49:16.159
- My horse?

49:16.159 --> 49:17.739
- Oh.

49:17.739 --> 49:20.929
- Yeah he hauled it all up the mountain,

49:20.929 --> 49:22.610
my dad bought him for me when I was five

49:22.610 --> 49:25.907
and we've been best friends ever since.

49:25.907 --> 49:28.218
- I like your dad, he's cool.

49:28.218 --> 49:31.135
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna keep him.

49:32.570 --> 49:34.153
I like your mom to.

49:36.387 --> 49:38.738
- Yeah, she's always there for me.

49:38.738 --> 49:39.571
- Yeah?

49:48.428 --> 49:49.511
That's Molly.

49:51.126 --> 49:55.293
We have a lot of one sided
conversations together.

50:06.359 --> 50:07.714
- Bet you could hit a rabbit from

50:07.714 --> 50:09.725
50 feet away with this thing.

50:09.725 --> 50:10.558
- Try 100.

50:13.786 --> 50:14.619
Mhm.

50:29.194 --> 50:30.297
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

50:30.297 --> 50:31.464
- That's okay.

50:34.154 --> 50:36.237
She died when I was five.

50:40.702 --> 50:44.035
It's just been me and my dad ever since.

50:46.463 --> 50:49.074
- My dad left before I was even born,

50:49.074 --> 50:51.407
I've never even met the guy.

50:54.772 --> 50:55.605
- Wow.

50:58.084 --> 50:59.291
So how long are you planning on

50:59.291 --> 51:01.791
staying here until California?

51:02.681 --> 51:05.241
- Probably gonna leave after graduation

51:05.241 --> 51:09.371
but if my mom saves up
enough money we'll go.

51:09.371 --> 51:10.859
- Oh.

51:10.859 --> 51:15.131
- Yeah, I don't know,
I kinda like it here.

51:15.131 --> 51:16.881
Well I'm starting to.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.829
Why won't you ever look at me?

51:26.371 --> 51:28.704
- I don't know, shy I guess.

51:32.010 --> 51:34.510
- I know what happened to you.

51:37.259 --> 51:38.561
We all have scars Clover.

51:38.561 --> 51:40.311
- Yeah not like mine.

51:42.651 --> 51:44.401
- You'd be surprised.

51:45.339 --> 51:49.506
I have scars didn't make us
know that our past is for real.

51:51.491 --> 51:53.324
- Pride and Prejudice.

51:55.649 --> 51:58.070
You know you're the first guy I've ever

51:58.070 --> 52:00.310
met who loves that book more than I do.

52:00.310 --> 52:02.393
(laughs)

52:03.470 --> 52:06.053
(gentle music)

52:28.290 --> 52:30.802
Finished all the dishes daddy.

52:30.802 --> 52:33.930
Anything else you want me to do?

52:33.930 --> 52:35.882
- Aren't you in a good mood.

52:35.882 --> 52:37.501
- It was a great day.

52:37.501 --> 52:40.084
- Anything I should know about.

52:43.210 --> 52:45.627
- No, it was just a good day.

52:47.832 --> 52:50.010
- Well that's good honey.

52:50.010 --> 52:53.593
I was thinking that,
you know Helen doesn't

52:54.671 --> 52:58.250
have any clothes and, I was thinking

52:58.250 --> 53:01.200
maybe we could give her
some of your mothers.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.283
If it's alright with you.

53:07.741 --> 53:10.241
- I think that's a great idea.

53:13.642 --> 53:15.010
- I was hoping you'd feel that way.

53:15.010 --> 53:17.593
(gentle music)

53:34.781 --> 53:37.031
(knocking)

53:48.093 --> 53:48.926
- Hey.

53:49.821 --> 53:50.654
- Hey.

53:54.679 --> 53:57.179
My dad wanted your mom to have

53:58.602 --> 54:02.423
those clothes they were my mom's so.

54:02.423 --> 54:04.673
- But isn't this your book?

54:05.911 --> 54:09.078
- Not anymore I wanted you to have it.

54:11.349 --> 54:14.182
- Wow, that means a lot thank you.

54:20.631 --> 54:22.131
- Well, goodnight.

54:25.612 --> 54:26.695
- Good night.

55:35.437 --> 55:38.270
- The more I see of the world the more

55:38.270 --> 55:41.280
am I dissatisfied with it and everyday

55:41.280 --> 55:42.680
confirms my belief of

55:42.680 --> 55:46.013
the inconstancy of all human characters.

55:50.119 --> 55:53.419
- Not everyone's like that Clover.

55:53.419 --> 55:56.919
Some of us are actually who we say we are.

56:04.110 --> 56:06.277
- Where did you come from?

56:08.219 --> 56:09.052
- Mars.

56:15.799 --> 56:17.549
You're looking at me.

56:21.310 --> 56:23.630
- It's easier in the dark.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.463
You can't see my scar.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.977
- I wanna show you something.

56:37.699 --> 56:41.616
Something that I've never
showed anyone before.

56:57.771 --> 56:59.104
- What happened?

57:01.243 --> 57:03.923
- I had a heart transplant
when I was a little boy.

57:03.923 --> 57:06.506
(gentle music)

57:21.296 --> 57:23.698
I told you we all had scars.

57:23.698 --> 57:26.281
(gentle music)

58:10.455 --> 58:12.057
You are so beautiful.

58:12.057 --> 58:14.640
(gentle music)

58:31.525 --> 58:33.754
- Didn't think you'd be here.

58:33.754 --> 58:35.921
I was planning on walking.

58:39.543 --> 58:43.293
- Clover I owe you an
apology, our friendship

58:44.340 --> 58:48.507
means more to me than anything
else and I'm really sorry.

59:10.223 --> 59:11.056
- Bridger.

59:17.354 --> 59:21.521
- Well Bridger it's pretty
lame what I did yesterday.

59:24.034 --> 59:26.951
But I hope we can still be friends.

59:29.095 --> 59:30.487
- I'd like that.

59:30.487 --> 59:31.737
- Cool, hop in.

59:33.375 --> 59:35.917
- Sweet ride, classic.

59:35.917 --> 59:37.426
- Finally.
- [Edward] Why Bridger?

59:37.426 --> 59:39.277
- Someone who appreciates
my wheels for what

59:39.277 --> 59:42.277
they truly are, a classic, a classic

59:43.745 --> 59:47.662
- So Albert, thinking I
can ride shotgun today?

59:49.346 --> 59:51.887
- Fine Edward but don't get used to it.

59:51.887 --> 59:52.720
- Man.

01:00:01.695 --> 01:00:03.935
(dramatic music)

01:00:03.935 --> 01:00:06.102
(yelling)

01:00:07.765 --> 01:00:10.182
- I want him, I call Bridger.

01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:14.279
(cheering)

01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:18.100

celebrated many victories

01:02:59.889 --> 01:03:01.798
and we have sorrowed after

01:03:01.798 --> 01:03:05.631
the many, many, many,
many enumerable defeats.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.327
But we have always picked
ourselves up and carried on.

01:03:15.818 --> 01:03:17.727
And so when you walk through

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.126
the doors today do not think

01:03:20.126 --> 01:03:22.937
that you are ending
your educational journey

01:03:22.937 --> 01:03:24.657
but that you are beginning

01:03:24.657 --> 01:03:27.740
the educational journey of your life.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:32.078
And so with out further ado I present

01:03:32.078 --> 01:03:35.995
to you the graduating
class of Greenville High.

01:03:36.907 --> 01:03:38.240
Congratulations.

01:03:39.187 --> 01:03:41.437
(cheering)

01:03:48.526 --> 01:03:49.827
- Hey, I'll be right back.

01:03:49.827 --> 01:03:50.660
- Where are you going?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.966
- Just to the bathroom.

01:03:51.966 --> 01:03:52.799
- Are you okay?

01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:53.849
- Yeah I'm fine.

01:03:53.849 --> 01:03:56.099
(cheering)

01:04:06.251 --> 01:04:08.418
(panting)

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:29.879
- I am so proud of you.

01:04:29.879 --> 01:04:30.799
- Hi dad.

01:04:30.799 --> 01:04:32.879
Thank you so much dad.

01:04:32.879 --> 01:04:33.712
- Congratulations guys.

01:04:33.712 --> 01:04:34.545
- Thank you.

01:04:34.545 --> 01:04:35.378
- Thanks.

01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:42.048
- [Bo] Hey Bridger.

01:04:42.048 --> 01:04:43.881
Fancy seeing you here.

01:04:45.479 --> 01:04:47.562
- Just leave it alone Bo.

01:04:48.993 --> 01:04:50.508
Alright?

01:04:50.508 --> 01:04:52.496
I'll be leaving this town for good

01:04:52.496 --> 01:04:55.228
and you'll never have to see me again.

01:04:55.228 --> 01:04:56.061
Okay?

01:04:56.061 --> 01:04:59.607
- I'm just going to give you
something to remember me by.

01:04:59.607 --> 01:05:00.537
- [Clover] I did it.

01:05:00.537 --> 01:05:03.616
- Well duh, you're to smart
for your own good young lady.

01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:05.767
- Thanks Mr. Williams.

01:05:05.767 --> 01:05:06.799
- [Roman] How you doing Will?

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:09.017
- I'm great Roman, good to
see ya, it's a great day.

01:05:09.017 --> 01:05:10.055
- Yeah it is.

01:05:10.055 --> 01:05:10.888
Miss Jenkins.

01:05:10.888 --> 01:05:15.021
- Nice to see you,
congratulations you guys.

01:05:15.021 --> 01:05:16.359
- Where Bridger?

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:18.807
- I was just coming to ask
you guys the same thing.

01:05:18.807 --> 01:05:21.640
- I think he went to the bathroom.

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.154
- Can you excuse me?

01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:30.447
- And you did.

01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:31.477
Alone.

01:05:31.477 --> 01:05:33.727
- Happy graduation Bridger.

01:05:35.988 --> 01:05:38.738
(dramatic chord)

01:05:40.027 --> 01:05:40.860
Grab him.

01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:45.465

01:05:45.465 --> 01:05:48.215

01:06:11.773 --> 01:06:13.093
- What'd you do?

01:06:13.093 --> 01:06:14.035
What'd you do!

01:06:14.035 --> 01:06:18.118
(thuds)
(clangs)

01:06:20.384 --> 01:06:21.217
Really?

01:06:23.264 --> 01:06:26.097
Come on, come on buddy, it's okay.

01:06:30.662 --> 01:06:32.115
Come on.

01:06:44.591 --> 01:06:46.431
- Only one person can
ride in the ambulance,

01:06:46.431 --> 01:06:47.264
we gotta go now.

01:06:47.264 --> 01:06:48.481
- Helen we'll follow.

01:06:48.481 --> 01:06:51.064

♪ I'm okay but I went to
see the doctor yesterday ♪

01:07:03.099 --> 01:07:04.099
- How is he?

01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:06.779
- The blunt force trauma he received

01:07:06.779 --> 01:07:10.696
to his head has caused
him to sink into a coma.

01:07:11.859 --> 01:07:14.107
But we have another serious problem.

01:07:14.107 --> 01:07:15.419
- What?

01:07:15.419 --> 01:07:18.969
- His body is rejecting
the heart transplant.

01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:22.969
- Why would that happen
now after all this time?

01:07:24.809 --> 01:07:28.488
- It happens frequently
in transplant patients.

01:07:28.488 --> 01:07:29.689
The rejection is causing the heart

01:07:29.689 --> 01:07:33.727
to become stiff and to contract poorly.

01:07:33.727 --> 01:07:37.867
The fear is that this
leads to heart failure.

01:07:37.867 --> 01:07:39.636
We've put him on another transplant list

01:07:39.636 --> 01:07:43.241
but that could take months or even years,

01:07:43.241 --> 01:07:44.824
we just don't know.

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:46.762

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.869

Mister Darcy you see, is the man.

01:10:17.194 --> 01:10:19.136
Now Lizzie I think I have surprised you,

01:10:19.136 --> 01:10:20.659
could he or the Lucas's have pitched

01:10:20.659 --> 01:10:23.326
on any man within the circle of.

01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:31.114
- [Girl] Hey.

01:10:31.114 --> 01:10:31.947
- Hey.

01:10:33.224 --> 01:10:37.391
- We're really sorry for
everything that we put you through.

01:10:43.634 --> 01:10:44.634
- Thank you.

01:10:47.085 --> 01:10:48.502
He'll like these.

01:10:49.533 --> 01:10:50.624
He had done all this for a girl

01:10:50.624 --> 01:10:53.293
whom he could neither regard nor esteem.

01:10:53.293 --> 01:10:55.415
Her heart did whisper that
he had done it for her.

01:10:55.415 --> 01:10:57.582
(beeping)

01:11:02.783 --> 01:11:04.033
Okay let's see.

01:11:04.954 --> 01:11:07.371
Is there another one in here?

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:12.354
A lady's imagination is very rapid,

01:11:12.354 --> 01:11:13.993
it jumps from admiration to love,

01:11:13.993 --> 01:11:17.683
from love to matrimony in a moment.

01:11:17.683 --> 01:11:19.016
- Then marry me.

01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:26.134
(gentle music)

01:11:29.822 --> 01:11:31.072
- You're awake?

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:36.104
(crying)

01:11:46.631 --> 01:11:49.298
- You didn't answer my question.

01:11:51.577 --> 01:11:53.160
- What did you say?

01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:56.591
- I said will you marry me?

01:11:59.442 --> 01:12:00.942
- Are you serious?

01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:05.392
- I love you Clover.

01:12:05.392 --> 01:12:09.151
I've never been more serious in my life.

01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:10.484
- I love you to.

01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:13.530
Of course I'll marry you.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:16.113
(gentle music)

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.301
- There's no long term damage.

01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:26.472
His cognitive skills and memory

01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:29.220
don't seem to have been affected.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.803
He's getting stronger everyday.

01:12:33.192 --> 01:12:35.082
- What about his heart?

01:12:35.082 --> 01:12:37.672
- The new medication seems to be helping

01:12:37.672 --> 01:12:39.992
but there are no guarantees.

01:12:39.992 --> 01:12:42.151
He needs to be monitored regularly

01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:44.376
and stay on his medication.

01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:45.209
- Okay.

01:12:46.421 --> 01:12:48.832
When can we take him home.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.165
- In a few days.

01:12:51.441 --> 01:12:53.693
- I heard you whooped Bo pretty good

01:12:53.693 --> 01:12:56.344
before they ganged up on ya.

01:12:56.344 --> 01:12:59.474
- Ya, thanks for finishing him off.

01:12:59.474 --> 01:13:01.064
- I wish I had gotten there sooner.

01:13:01.064 --> 01:13:02.094
I'm sorry.

01:13:02.094 --> 01:13:03.094
- It's okay.

01:13:04.073 --> 01:13:07.524
- They will be doing some jail
time for aggravated assault.

01:13:07.524 --> 01:13:08.857
That's for sure.

01:13:09.792 --> 01:13:11.959
- Sorry you lost your job.

01:13:13.041 --> 01:13:15.440
- School boards hands were tied.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.441
Besides I think it's
time for me to move on.

01:13:18.441 --> 01:13:19.993
So what about you?

01:13:19.993 --> 01:13:22.201
You staying, you going?

01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:23.542
What going on?

01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:26.492
- We're getting married yeah,

01:13:26.492 --> 01:13:30.782
and we're gonna spend
the summer at the beach.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:31.615
- What?

01:13:32.972 --> 01:13:34.722
When did this happen?

01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:37.258
- A few days ago.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.910
- I'm stepping out, excuse me.

01:13:47.481 --> 01:13:48.532
- I'll be right back.

01:13:48.532 --> 01:13:49.365
- Kay.

01:14:00.782 --> 01:14:04.330
- Well, can't say this isn't awkward.

01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:05.866
- Yeah.

01:14:05.866 --> 01:14:07.241
- Let's go grab a burger.

01:14:07.241 --> 01:14:08.074
- Yup, good idea.

01:14:08.074 --> 01:14:09.157
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.948
- Glad you're feeling better.

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:30.124
- I'm really happy for you.

01:14:30.124 --> 01:14:33.041
All of your dreams are coming true.

01:14:33.993 --> 01:14:36.342
- Why are you crying?

01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:38.833
- Because I'm gonna miss you.

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:40.918
- I want you to come with us.

01:14:40.918 --> 01:14:42.452
- Really?

01:14:42.452 --> 01:14:44.472
- Yeah we started this journey together,

01:14:44.472 --> 01:14:47.564
we have to finish it and go see the ocean.

01:14:47.564 --> 01:14:49.212
- Okay.

01:14:49.212 --> 01:14:51.295
- Dad, dad wait a second.

01:14:54.222 --> 01:14:56.305
I thought you'd be happy.

01:14:58.044 --> 01:14:59.172
- I am.

01:14:59.172 --> 01:15:01.922
- Well you're not acting like it.

01:15:04.572 --> 01:15:08.739
- I couldn't ask for a better
young man to marry my daughter

01:15:10.382 --> 01:15:13.811
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:17.978
- He has already given me
enough love to last forever.

01:15:19.401 --> 01:15:20.651
I love him dad.

01:15:24.428 --> 01:15:25.261
Please.

01:15:26.547 --> 01:15:28.214
I need your support.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.503

You may now kiss the bride.

01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:22.538
Don't worry I'll be back.

01:16:23.783 --> 01:16:25.833
- You needn't worry Clover,

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:28.432
I will take very good care of Donnie.

01:16:28.432 --> 01:16:29.765
- Thanks Albert.

01:16:30.724 --> 01:16:33.462
You know you'll always be my best friend.

01:16:33.462 --> 01:16:34.629
- Yeah I know.

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:39.888
(engine rumbling)

01:16:47.163 --> 01:16:49.754
- Hey, the engine sounds great.

01:16:49.754 --> 01:16:51.775
- Well you guys did a good job.

01:16:51.775 --> 01:16:54.500
- You gonna auction it off now?

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.588
- No.

01:16:55.588 --> 01:16:56.580
- You gonna keep it?

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.413
- Nope.

01:16:58.802 --> 01:16:59.635
You are.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.282
- No way, really?

01:17:03.282 --> 01:17:05.492

as a wedding present.

01:17:05.492 --> 01:17:07.321

01:17:07.321 --> 01:17:08.703
- You don't have to say anything.
