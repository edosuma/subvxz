How's dinner looking? 'Cause
it's getting kind of late.

- Mom, this isn't the good china.

22:00.140 --> 22:01.726
This is going to be my seventh

- Hey! No boys allowed. Strip or split.
- Yeah.

22:36.526 --> 22:39.023
- Yeah.
- I needed to talk to you.

I didn't expect to see you

22:40.470 --> 22:41.960

22:47.671 --> 22:49.000
She did? Is everything okay?

22:49.025 --> 22:50.718
- No.
- What happened?

22:51.564 --> 22:52.960
Well, she said everything was okay,

22:52.985 --> 22:56.054
but she kept taking these long
pauses like it was Morse code.

22:56.629 --> 22:58.859
My parental bells rang hard, Beth.

22:59.597 --> 23:00.945
So nothing's wrong?

23:01.351 --> 23:04.242
Well, she said she was calling
just to check in on me,

23:04.267 --> 23:06.421
- but I think that...
- Oh, my God, Randall!

23:06.585 --> 23:08.171
You seriously crashed your sister's

23:08.196 --> 23:09.804
bachelorette party to tell me that?

23:09.829 --> 23:11.242
Beth, I know what this sounds like,

23:11.267 --> 23:12.882
- but my gut tells me...
- One night.

23:12.907 --> 23:15.242
You couldn't give me one night.

23:15.267 --> 23:18.912
I sit inside your anxiety every
damn minute of every damn day,

23:18.937 --> 23:20.836
- Excuse me, Beth.
- and you can't give me one night...

23:20.861 --> 23:23.101
I didn't realize that it was so
difficult being married to me.

23:23.126 --> 23:24.617
Hey, it's not always a party, husband.

23:24.642 --> 23:26.281
Well, I'll tell you something, wife.

You know, I may lead with my
heart, but at least I've got...

23:29.716 --> 23:32.226
What? No. What? Say it.
You're gonna say I'm heartless?

23:32.251 --> 23:35.015
- No, not my words.
- No, because you said I was detached.

23:35.657 --> 23:37.437
You said I was the head,
and now you're trying to say

23:37.462 --> 23:40.109
I'm heartless because
I just want a break from this?

23:40.134 --> 23:42.039
- From all this?
- From all of this?

23:43.109 --> 23:44.510
You know what, Beth? You're right.

23:44.793 --> 23:46.085
The way that you're reacting

23:46.110 --> 23:48.218
to everything that's happened
is perfectly normal.

23:48.326 --> 23:49.459
You're all heart.

- You know what? Screw you!

- RANDALL: Screw you, Beth.
- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

23:58.251 --> 24:00.500
Everybody take it easy.
Let's just take it easy.

24:00.525 --> 24:01.992
- Hey.
- Hey, please stay out of this.

24:02.017 --> 24:03.223
This is between me and Randall.

24:03.248 --> 24:04.523
This doesn't have anything
to do with you right now.

24:04.548 --> 24:07.039
I understand that. I...
But can you understand

24:07.064 --> 24:08.500
- where he's coming from?
- Please just sit back down,

24:08.525 --> 24:10.054
- all right?
- I'm not gonna sit down.

24:10.079 --> 24:11.898
Kate, this is not a Big Three moment.

24:11.923 --> 24:13.750
I know that, but he's my brother.

- He's also my husband.
- Oh, I know.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.796
Randall has made it very clear
who's more important to him.

24:23.638 --> 24:25.289
I don't know why I just said that.

24:25.569 --> 24:27.023

- I never what?
- Jack, really?

24:48.343 --> 24:50.491
Well, I had to go wash my hands

- 'cause he had me cutting the onions.
- Oh, no.

can eat it tomorrow.

26:06.151 --> 26:07.374
Oh, we'll be fine.

so much greased-up man meat,

first time for everything.

26:17.374 --> 26:19.296
She wanted to make sure you were okay.

26:24.334 --> 26:27.882
I just want you to know, okay,
that I like to pride myself

26:28.044 --> 26:29.843
on being the first person to realize

26:29.868 --> 26:32.203
that Randall Pearson
was the coolest human ever.

<i>I've known that since we were kids.</i>

<i>You know, everyone thinks that
it was always Kevin and Kate.</i>

26:38.252 --> 26:39.853
<i>But the year after Dad died,</i>

26:40.050 --> 26:42.406
it was Kate and Randall

26:42.546 --> 26:45.507
eating Hot Pockets and watching
Mom pretending to be okay.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.020
<i>And binge-watching Sex and the City</i>

26:47.054 --> 26:48.960
<i>when binge-watching wasn't even a thing.</i>

26:49.382 --> 26:52.162
<i>And I knew that one day
that I was gonna lose you</i>

26:52.187 --> 26:54.210
<i>to somebody who was as cool as Beth.</i>

26:54.914 --> 26:57.070
But that someday... it happened so fast.

26:58.065 --> 27:01.396
And, God, she is spectacular.
I-I get it, I know it.

27:01.421 --> 27:04.531
But then, when I did,
when I lost you, I...

27:04.556 --> 27:08.025
First off, you can never lose me.

27:08.445 --> 27:09.750
Not even if you tried.

27:10.234 --> 27:12.278
You basically got brother LoJack on me.

27:12.531 --> 27:16.405
Okay? Kate, I was
a straight, black teenage boy.

27:16.430 --> 27:19.406

Uh, did you guys, like, bond?

27:46.806 --> 27:48.171
Did you, um, do the secret handshake?

'Cause I think he really wants
a secret handshake.

(LAUGHS) What? No. We... I just...

27:52.651 --> 27:54.187
We left him with his friends.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.757
(SIGHS) Okay.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.132
What?

28:01.171 --> 28:03.148
It's just that
his friends were the fillers.

28:04.445 --> 28:06.937
And he just wanted this weekend

28:06.962 --> 28:10.598
to be about, you know,
you and Kevin, and...

28:16.203 --> 28:18.265
- Hey, man.
- Uh, hey.

28:19.645 --> 28:22.156
I thought you guys had
gone to bed or something.

28:22.593 --> 28:24.718
Yeah, about that. We, uh...

- We're sorry we bailed on you tonight.
- Right.

Honestly, we didn't think you'd miss us.

28:29.147 --> 28:32.429
Oh, honestly, I didn't, so...

28:36.379 --> 28:38.632
- Want to go for a walk?
- Yeah, let me get my jacket.

to sit at the table and eat right now.

28:50.537 --> 28:51.856
Why don't you just put it out,

28:51.881 --> 28:54.035
and I'll come back downstairs
and wrap it up later.

28:54.060 --> 28:57.543
Yeah, I'm just gonna let it
cool off a little bit.

29:00.101 --> 29:03.059
Wow. I mean, they really did try.

the follow-through, but...

29:07.619 --> 29:10.254
Well, it's hard to live up
to your standard. It is.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.348
- Hey, babe?
- Mm-hmm.

29:15.516 --> 29:17.817
I really missed
giving you a gift this year.

29:17.842 --> 29:19.262
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:19.762 --> 29:21.356
Even if it wasn't gonna be as great

29:21.381 --> 29:23.027
as the one you would have given me.

29:25.652 --> 29:26.957
I'm sorry for...

29:28.185 --> 29:30.004
de-Jacking you.

29:30.821 --> 29:31.981
De-Jacking me?

29:32.006 --> 29:33.090
(LAUGHS)

29:34.668 --> 29:35.910
- Yeah.
- Yes?

29:35.989 --> 29:37.277
- Hey.
- Yeah.

29:37.515 --> 29:40.074
- Let's never do nothing again.
- No. Yeah.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.777
- Deal?
- Deal.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.559
Come on, let's go upstairs.

30:01.184 --> 30:02.582
What? Jack.

30:02.607 --> 30:03.723
- No...
- Is this you?

30:03.748 --> 30:05.535
No, this is not me, I swear.

30:05.882 --> 30:07.027
(CHUCKLES): I swear.

30:09.593 --> 30:10.723
What is that?

30:13.597 --> 30:14.762
"Mom and Dad."

30:18.769 --> 30:20.621
"Dear Mom and Dad, go out on the roof,

30:20.646 --> 30:24.549
lie down, look up, hold hands
and wait. Love, the Big Three."

30:24.574 --> 30:25.809
- "Meteor shower."
- Oh.

30:25.834 --> 30:26.905
(LAUGHS)

30:26.930 --> 30:28.238
Well, you did it, babe.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.645
- You created mini yous.
- We did.

30:32.115 --> 30:33.332
You did.

30:34.649 --> 30:35.996
Look at this.

30:46.003 --> 30:48.410
Madison is drunk snoring
in my room. (CHUCKLES)

30:49.379 --> 30:51.051
Who knew that such a loud sound

30:51.076 --> 30:52.754
could come from such a tiny person?

30:55.234 --> 30:58.043
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

And when I'm drunk.

31:10.111 --> 31:11.262
I didn't know that.

31:12.423 --> 31:13.606
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:14.916 --> 31:16.918
It's really hard for me to make friends.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.387
My brothers were my friends.

31:20.684 --> 31:23.426
I was always, um, self-conscious

31:23.474 --> 31:24.621
and, um...

31:25.371 --> 31:28.535
defensive around strong women.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.043
I mean, look no further than my mother.

31:33.636 --> 31:37.906
And so when Randall met you,
I was, I was intimidated.

31:38.879 --> 31:40.871
Intimidated? Why?

31:42.941 --> 31:44.301
Because you're flawless.

31:44.399 --> 31:45.988
Because when I was a waitress,

31:46.366 --> 31:49.215
you were getting a master's
and building a house.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.668
And then you...
you have a meaningful job.

31:53.693 --> 31:56.270
You bought a building
and you foster kids.

31:56.295 --> 31:58.910
And I-I sing and I-I adopted a dog.

32:00.082 --> 32:01.379
Kate... (SCOFFS)

32:02.456 --> 32:04.824
Man, I am so far

32:05.559 --> 32:08.043
from doing what I actually want to do

32:08.068 --> 32:11.777
in my job that I agreed to buy
a building with your brother,

32:11.863 --> 32:13.973
which is exhausting.

32:14.441 --> 32:17.629
And that is nothing
compared to fostering,

32:17.654 --> 32:22.692
which is the hardest thing
I have ever done in my life.

32:24.802 --> 32:27.152
And I went and got myself
attached to this little girl,

32:27.177 --> 32:28.520
and now she's gone.

32:29.888 --> 32:30.981
And...

32:32.498 --> 32:34.668
I've been trying not to think about her,

32:36.270 --> 32:38.176
but it's... I can't. It's like...

32:41.011 --> 32:43.457
I just keep wondering, like,
is she okay, you know?

32:43.482 --> 32:44.645
Is she cold?

32:45.876 --> 32:47.106
Is she stressed?

32:49.304 --> 32:52.879
Does her science teacher
know how smart she is?

32:53.741 --> 32:54.973
Oh, Beth.

32:56.416 --> 32:57.785
I'm sorry.

32:58.313 --> 32:59.785
I'm so sorry.

33:00.081 --> 33:01.379
Such is life.

33:07.424 --> 33:10.348
So I-I had this whole new plan
for my life, you know,

33:11.449 --> 33:12.824
and for my career, actually.

33:12.849 --> 33:15.316
And then the movie fell apart,
then the plan fell apart,

33:15.341 --> 33:18.113
so I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

33:18.487 --> 33:19.676
Randall, you go.

33:20.490 --> 33:24.035
Uh... I got to let go of Deja.

33:25.301 --> 33:27.090
I got to move on, mentally,

33:27.115 --> 33:29.746
and not put it on my wife
to be the only strong one.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.215
You came up with that all by yourself?

33:32.240 --> 33:33.785
Listen, man, he... that's his thing.

33:33.810 --> 33:35.621
He does that. What about you?

33:36.121 --> 33:38.691
Whew. I'm just wondering if it
was worth dropping a few grand

33:38.716 --> 33:41.160
to fly three strangers out here
so I didn't look lame

33:41.185 --> 33:43.043
in front of my future brothers-in-law.

33:47.514 --> 33:49.816
- You guys know I have a brother?
- No.

33:51.106 --> 33:53.340
Yeah. He, uh, couldn't
make it this weekend.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.973
I doubt he even tried.

33:56.277 --> 34:00.623
I was ten when he was born,
so I adored the kid since birth.

34:00.657 --> 34:02.832
I-I remember, I was 16,
I was such a nerd.

34:02.857 --> 34:03.941
I was like a...

34:03.966 --> 34:07.035
like a Dungeons & Dragons
by myself kind of nerd.

34:07.060 --> 34:07.793
Ugh.

34:07.818 --> 34:09.315
You do not want to
know what it feels like

34:09.341 --> 34:13.139
to be a 16-year-old when
your six-year-old brother says

34:13.164 --> 34:15.431
he doesn't want
to play with you anymore.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.440
And you know that he means it.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.996
Look, I'm sorry I brought
you guys all this way

34:23.021 --> 34:24.262
with everything you got going on.

34:24.286 --> 34:26.598
I just got excited about
having a second chance at...

34:27.676 --> 34:29.340
two new brothers, you know?

34:31.379 --> 34:32.434
I wanted to impress you,

34:32.458 --> 34:35.534
and not-and not just because
my gal loves you,

34:35.560 --> 34:37.706
but because you guys
impress the hell out of me.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.237
Kevin Costner.

34:45.762 --> 34:47.895
Kevin Costner was cut out of
<i>The Big Chill.</i>

34:48.022 --> 34:50.996
Four years later, he went on
to star in <i>The Untouchables</i>

34:51.021 --> 34:53.190
with Connery, Garcia and De Niro.

34:53.715 --> 34:55.340
Do you have Ron Howard's phone number

34:55.364 --> 34:56.895
in that fancy phone of yours?

34:57.787 --> 34:58.793
Yeah.

34:59.319 --> 35:01.053
- Call him.
- No.

35:01.252 --> 35:02.520
- Y-Yeah.
- No.

35:02.703 --> 35:05.402
You call him,
and you tell him he has made

35:05.427 --> 35:08.566
a <i>Pretty Woman</i> sized mistake. Big.

35:08.959 --> 35:10.895
Huge. All right?

35:10.920 --> 35:13.387
Y-You-You thank him for the opportunity,

35:13.887 --> 35:16.824
but you let him know that it's his loss.

35:16.953 --> 35:19.426
You make him believe it
because you believe it.

35:19.847 --> 35:21.645
- Now, Randy. Can I call you Randy?
- No.

35:21.670 --> 35:25.066
Okay. I'm not gonna give you
any advice about Deja.

35:26.110 --> 35:29.762
But know this: if you, Randall Pearson,

35:29.787 --> 35:32.051
are beating yourself up about anything,

35:32.215 --> 35:33.965
then the rest of the world

gonna be a famous chef one day.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

what Randall told me

36:08.677 --> 36:10.449
about meteor showers?

36:10.788 --> 36:14.145
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, he kind of told me a lot.

36:14.723 --> 36:17.199
- Like, a lot. (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHS) Of course.

36:17.292 --> 36:20.427
But what he told me, at least the...

36:21.606 --> 36:23.027
the part that I understood,

36:23.770 --> 36:27.027
was that meteors are always up there,

36:27.570 --> 36:29.043
whizzing around.
