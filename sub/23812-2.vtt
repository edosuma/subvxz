00:06.207 --> 00:07.539

- Yep!

00:07.641 --> 00:09.341
Just take two more step...

00:10.945 --> 00:13.312
Oh, guess it was just one step.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.218
- Welcome to the
Phoenix Squad rec room.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.654
- Whoa.
And ow!

00:24.225 --> 00:26.625
- Each squad gets their
own hangout in the castle.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.861
- But only ours has this.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.663
Prudence from downtown!

00:35.202 --> 00:36.802
Yes!

00:39.040 --> 00:40.806
- Sorry, I get a little excited.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.877
- Want to read a book by
the crystal fireplace?

00:44.979 --> 00:46.245
Just call out a title.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.280
Bookshelf, "Diary
of a Whimpy Knight."

00:52.753 --> 00:54.853
- I always said
reading was dangerous.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.758
- And if you want to chill out,

00:59.860 --> 01:03.128
try one of our magical
jelly beanbag chairs.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.899
- My butt's gonna love that!

01:09.470 --> 01:11.737
- Just don't eat
the jelly beans.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.472
You'll explode.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.009
- That's the horn
for knight school.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.410
We better go.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.912
- Ciarra, wait.
I-I need you to...

01:20.014 --> 01:21.480
- Yes, Arc.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.115
I promise I'll keep your secret

01:23.217 --> 01:24.616
that you lied your way
into knight school.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.919
- No, I-I need help out
of this candy trap.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.157
You touched my ring!

01:32.259 --> 01:34.193
- I know!
Your princess is showing!

01:37.264 --> 01:39.198
- Next time, remind me
to use my other hand

01:39.300 --> 01:41.300
so no one else
finds out my secret.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.634
- It's okay.
They left.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.803
- Trust me, Warwick
always forgets something.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.706
- Forgot my shield.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.542
Oh, and my sword.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.746
- ♪ Ahh, oh, ahh ♪

01:55.916 --> 01:59.685
- I may only be a quarter
giant, but I'm 100% hungry.

02:05.059 --> 02:07.025
- Good job, Prudy!

02:07.128 --> 02:09.161
You didn't eat the
bone this time!

02:11.065 --> 02:12.865
Ouch!

02:12.967 --> 02:14.666
- I know that ouch.

02:17.338 --> 02:21.373
Fizz, what are you doing here?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.675
- I want to see
my hero in action.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.244
- Thanks, kid.

02:25.346 --> 02:29.014
But, uh, I put my battle
pants on one leg at a time,

02:29.116 --> 02:30.282
just like you.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.185
- Heh, heh.
Not you, Hair Gel.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.687
- He means Warwick.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.323
This is his little
brother, Fizzwick.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.959
- Oh, you can't keep
sneaking into knight school.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.361
- But you're always telling me

02:42.463 --> 02:44.463
how you're the best knight
in this school since Dad.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.099
I need to soak in my
brother's awesomeness.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.203
- What you need to do is go
soak in a shower, Garbage Boy!

02:52.439 --> 02:54.606
- Yes!
Warwick gave me a nickname!

02:56.844 --> 02:58.877
- Squads, gather around!

02:58.979 --> 03:02.748
Kraken Squad, Unicorn
Squad, Phoenix Squad.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.016
As you know,

03:04.118 --> 03:06.618
only the best squad in knight
school will become knights.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.622
And to help decide, I'm proud
to announce the annual...

03:10.724 --> 03:11.924
Roxbury Cup.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.325
Yeah!

03:13.427 --> 03:15.661
- The competition is
named for Sir Roxbury,

03:15.763 --> 03:20.032
who saved Astoria from the
great ocean hag infestation...

03:20.134 --> 03:22.568
which really wasn't all
that-that great, by the way.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.236
It wasn't.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.940
You have until tomorrow to
inform me who from your squad

03:28.042 --> 03:30.042
will compete to win the cup.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.119
- Jeez, how will we ever decide?

03:41.222 --> 03:44.256
- I'm doin' it!
- Are you sure?

03:44.358 --> 03:46.992
'Cause Ciarra beats
you all the time,

03:47.094 --> 03:49.127
and I have to cheer you
up with my happy dance.

03:51.732 --> 03:55.000
- I was the best in knight
school before Ciarra showed up.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.469
Maybe if I beat her in
front of the whole castle,

03:57.571 --> 04:00.239
then everyone will remember
how great I am.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.074
Then I can do my
happy dance too.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.843
Ah, yeah!

04:04.945 --> 04:07.179
That looks the same
as your mean dance.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.350
- Hey, since I'm the new guy,

04:11.452 --> 04:13.051
I'd love a chance
to compete for us.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.621
- Arc, that's so nice of you.

04:15.723 --> 04:16.887
No.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.658
- Why do you get to decide?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.892
- Because I want to
win like I always do.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.962
- Well, I want to win
that big fancy cup.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.898
- You can hold mine after I win.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.968
- I'm gonna win.
- No, I'm gonna win.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.571
- No, I'm gonna win!
- No, I'm gonna win!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.072
- Should we take
away their swords?

04:35.409 --> 04:36.642
- That's a yes.

- Guys!

05:06.340 --> 05:08.807
You've been shouting at
each other for hours.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.142
You have to settle this.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.611
- I want to settle this.
- No, I want to settle this.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.146
- What about a coin flip?

05:14.248 --> 05:17.182
- Good idea.
Coin, get over here.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.119
- You called for me?

05:21.221 --> 05:24.222
- Arc, this is Coin.
He's a flipping elf.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.226
- I call tails.
I'm assuming that's his butt.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.963
- Arc's the butt.
That checks out.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.500
- Hit it, Coin.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.569
- Flippity-flip-flip!

05:37.671 --> 05:39.204
Whoa!

05:40.074 --> 05:41.540
- Tails.
Arc wins.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.674
- Yeah!

05:42.776 --> 05:44.476
- Oh, come on!
That elf is bottom heavy.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.380
- Too late.
The elf's big booty has spoken.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.382
I'm in the Roxbury Cup.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.254
- Fizz, I told you
you're not allowed

05:56.357 --> 05:57.789
to hang out at knight school.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.124
- I work here now.

05:59.226 --> 06:03.595
You're looking at knight
school's new dean of bookcases.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.597
- He means knight
school's janitor.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.234
Now, go spit clean the weapons.

06:09.336 --> 06:13.839
- I get to spit on stuff?
This job keeps getting better!

06:13.941 --> 06:15.340
- This is bad.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.975
I've been keeping
Fizz away from knight school

06:17.077 --> 06:18.176
so he wouldn't realize...

06:18.278 --> 06:20.278
- You're not as amazing
as you told him you are.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.415
- No one is that amazing.
No one.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.185
- Relax.
You're getting better every day.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.920
- You know what?
You're right.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.022
I'm gonna be a legendary
knight just like my dad.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.563
- It was their fault
for standing there.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.267
- Attention, students!

06:42.369 --> 06:45.771
It's time to find out who will
compete in the Roxbury Cup.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.572
First up, Kraken Squad.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.044
Kraken's
choice is Sage.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.480
- Welcome to the age of Sage.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.551
- Yeah, she's done
embarrassing herself.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.488
- And next, Phoenix Squad.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.027
- What is that?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.228
- It's my intro music.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.630
It's my first knight
school contest.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.798
I have to make a splash.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.074

07:24.211 --> 07:26.445
- What?
You're sitting this out?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.813
I need to take you down.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.081
Not some chump doing
the Funky Griffin.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.951
- Sage, mind your own business.

07:33.053 --> 07:37.189
- Oh.
I get what's going on.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.857
You're letting Arc compete
because you know

07:38.959 --> 07:42.394
I'm finally gonna beat you.
Loser!

07:42.496 --> 07:46.898
- Oh, you want a loser?
You got a loser!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.333
That came out wrong!

07:50.037 --> 07:52.003
- The Phoenix
Squad's choice is...

07:55.075 --> 07:55.907
Ciarra.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.275
- What?

07:57.377 --> 07:58.877
- Yeah, next time, pick
a shorter intro song.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.312
Just tighten it.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.281
- Look, I am so sorry, Arc.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.951
Sage said things and I
kinda just lost my mind.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.252
You get that, right?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.920
- I get that you stole my spot.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.523
You know, I really wanted this.
Why do you always have to win?

08:11.625 --> 08:14.359
- I don't.
I just always have to not lose.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.529
- Isn't that the same thing?
- You're the same thing!

08:19.366 --> 08:20.765
- Well, it's about time
someone taught you

08:20.868 --> 08:23.502
that winning isn't everything,
and that someone is me.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.070
Cue my outro music!

08:37.083 --> 08:38.549
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪

08:39.785 --> 08:40.784
- That's it.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.822
I'm taking you
down to Fizz Tower.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.660
- Fizz, what are you doing?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.796
- That kid said Warwick
isn't in the Roxbury Cup

08:51.899 --> 08:53.598
because he stinks.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.902
- Whaaaat?

08:57.004 --> 08:59.838
- Yeah, whaaaat?

08:59.940 --> 09:01.006
- I know, right?

09:01.108 --> 09:04.109
But seriously, bro,
why aren't you competing?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.244
- I didn't want
to tell you this,

09:06.346 --> 09:09.481
but Sir Gareth gave me a special
assignment during the match.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.017
I have to...
- Protect the castle.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.085
- Yeah.
- Yup!

09:14.187 --> 09:16.821
- What's going to attack?
A monster?

09:16.924 --> 09:21.426
- A scary monster that's
part fish, part Sasquatch.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.627
A Basquatch!

09:24.031 --> 09:26.364
- Of course.
They're in season.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.067
- Which is why the top
student in knight school

09:29.169 --> 09:30.368
has to save the castle.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.804
- While the top student's
brother cheers him on.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.972
- That's right!

09:34.074 --> 09:35.774
Wait, what, no.
That's very wrong.

09:42.449 --> 09:46.851
Prudy, if a Basquatch
doesn't attack,

09:46.954 --> 09:49.020
Fizz will know I'm a phony.

09:49.122 --> 09:54.059
- Then we'll just have to make
sure a Basquatch shows up.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.327
- To be clear,

09:55.429 --> 09:57.796
you're gonna dress up
like a Basquatch, right?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.600
I have a fur bodysuit
in my closet.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.901
- Why?

10:04.905 --> 10:08.340
- Because sometimes I
like to feel pretty.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.678
- ♪ Hey
Na, na, nana ♪

10:13.780 --> 10:16.114
♪ Na, na, nana, na, na ♪

10:16.216 --> 10:17.415
- It is a beautiful day

10:17.517 --> 10:20.118
for a royal speed walk
in my new exercise crown.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.823
- My King?
May I bother you for a sec?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.725
I'm here on behalf of the
students of knight school

10:26.827 --> 10:29.894
to invite the princess to
attend our Roxbury Cup tomorrow.

10:29.997 --> 10:34.666
- Uh, that is very nice of
you, but I already have plans.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.667
- What plans?

10:35.769 --> 10:39.270
- I'm, uh, practicing
my princess wave.

10:39.373 --> 10:40.705
See?
It's like a wet noodle.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.608
- Nonsense!

10:43.710 --> 10:45.510
I command you to
attend the Roxbury Cup.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.514
And we're walking!

10:56.857 --> 10:58.990
- Do you have any idea
of what you just did?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.526
- Well, I made it so Ciarra will
have to quit the competition

11:01.628 --> 11:04.062
and I'll take her place.
- Ciarra can't quit.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.964
Quitters get kicked
out of knight school.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.432
- They do?
- Yes.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.301
And thanks to you, I also have
to be there as the princess.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.337
- Well, how are you gonna
be in two places at...

11:12.439 --> 11:13.872
oh, I see it now.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.006
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪

11:17.477 --> 11:18.309

11:24.418 --> 11:25.450
Uh oh.

11:29.623 --> 11:32.424
- Whoa, you have
another secret passage?

11:32.526 --> 11:33.692
Well, let's talk about that,

11:33.794 --> 11:36.227
forget everything else
that happened today.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.697
- You ruined my
knight school dreams.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.032
- You started this when you
ruined my Roxbury Cup dreams.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.668
- You mean the dream
you've had since yesterday?

11:44.738 --> 11:47.872
- Look, I'm the new guy.
All right?

11:47.974 --> 11:50.241
I'm not gonna feel like a real
member of the Phoenix Squad

11:50.343 --> 11:52.610
unless I prove I
make us stronger.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.612
- I didn't know
you felt that way.

11:54.715 --> 11:58.116
- You wouldn't, 'cause all
you care about is winning.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.617
- That's because
this whole kingdom

11:59.720 --> 12:01.886
thinks of me as just a princess.

12:01.988 --> 12:04.756
I want to become a knight to
show them I'm more than that.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.192
And the only way I can do
that is if I keep winning.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.495
- You make it really hard
to stay mad at you

12:10.597 --> 12:11.796
when you say stuff like that.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.067
- Now I have to figure out how
the princess and Ciarra

12:16.169 --> 12:19.337
can be at the Roxbury Cup
at the same time.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.039
- We need to figure it out.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.241
We made a promise to protect
each other's secrets,

12:23.343 --> 12:24.943
and that's what we're gonna do.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.712
- That means a lot.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.082
- Now that we're cool, can I
use your secret passageway?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.584
- We're not that cool.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.320
- ♪ Ah ♪

12:35.422 --> 12:36.421
♪ Oh, na, na ♪

12:36.523 --> 12:39.124
♪ Nana, na, na, na ♪

12:39.226 --> 12:40.825
- Okay, when the
Basquatch comes,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.595
I'll sneak up on him as he gets
distracted by his favorite food,

12:43.697 --> 12:45.463
shrimp calzones.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.368
- It's coming!

12:57.377 --> 12:59.144
- Basquatch, meet my foot.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.686
- Oh no!

13:09.556 --> 13:11.289
- Great costume, Prudy!

13:11.391 --> 13:14.159
Let's make this quick so
we can go watch Ciarra win.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.760
Okay, here come the slaps.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.137
Aah!

13:31.378 --> 13:33.611
- Prudy, what gives?

13:34.548 --> 13:37.182
Oh, you're not Prudy!

13:39.853 --> 13:41.519
Let me guess, here
comes the slaps?

13:46.993 --> 13:47.725
- ♪ Hey ♪

13:47.828 --> 13:50.929
♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪

13:51.031 --> 13:52.697
- Okay, I told
Sir Gareth the princess

13:52.799 --> 13:54.132
was sick and contagious.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.534
So you say hello, then
watch from inside this hut.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.103
- Then I'll transform into
Ciarra and win that cup.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.805
- Then we go home through
your secret passageway.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.140
- It's still not gonna happen.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.213
- Welcome to the Roxbury Cup!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.685
- Our princess must
watch from that hut

14:13.787 --> 14:16.354
because she has a revolting
case of bubble gut.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.157
- You could've just
said I had a cold.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.758
- Yeah, I could've.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.532
- Princess, so you have
any words for the students?

14:27.634 --> 14:30.835
- I do, Sir Gareth.
Be brave!

14:30.937 --> 14:33.071
And stay out of my hut.
For Astoria!

14:33.173 --> 14:34.906
For Astoria!

14:36.109 --> 14:40.545
- To begin, let's welcome
Sage from Kraken Squad.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.684
- I knew you'd win, Sage!
Happy dance!

14:47.587 --> 14:48.820
- Haven't started
yet, Buttercup.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.121
- Okay.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.125
- Nigel from Unicorn Squad.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.131
- And for Phoenix Squad, Ciarra!

15:01.701 --> 15:03.568
- I'm here!
- Oh, sorry.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.070
I didn't see you.
You were on my patch side.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.305
There you are.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.644
For this year's competition, we
will playing Capture the Hag.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.382
FYI, I'm the hag.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.119
- This is a full contact battle.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.189
The first student to capture the
hag in their net wins the cup.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.397
Oh, you'll never catch me,
land lovers!

15:36.736 --> 15:38.569
- That hag's more slippery
than the baby mermaid

15:38.672 --> 15:40.271
that ate off my toe.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.077
- You...

15:52.152 --> 15:54.652
- Prudy, looking great, girl.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.454
- Aww! Thanks.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.159
Aah!

16:03.096 --> 16:06.364
- I'm gonna go tell Warwick
how great he's doing.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.970
- That's a real
Basquatch, Prudy.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.707
- I know you're scared.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.844
- But you've got two choices.
You can run and hide.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.013
- Done.
Where was I?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.082
- Or...

16:24.184 --> 16:26.718
you can stay here
and fight this thing.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.220
If you do that, you may just
become the brave knight

16:29.322 --> 16:30.855
you've been telling
your brother about.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.096
- Yeah, you're right.
I can do this.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.098
I'm the mighty Warwick, the...

16:52.145 --> 16:54.579
- Whoa, oh, oh, oh!
Bro!

16:54.681 --> 16:57.148
He fell right into
your tree trap!

16:58.184 --> 17:01.986
- Yeah, I call that
one the Branch Lanch.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.255
- I'm gonna go tell
everyone you don't stink.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.291
- We did it, Prudy.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.229
Only I have to pretend to be
brave for four more years.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.164
- Let's go watch
Ciarra win the cup.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.200
You forgot your sword.
- Oh, I forgot my sword again.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.681
- Yo, Hag!
Get your ugly butt in my net!

17:30.784 --> 17:34.118
- Sea talk
won't work on me!

17:47.167 --> 17:49.067
- Princess, are you
enjoying the contest?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.435
- Uh oh!

17:50.537 --> 17:52.537
- Princess, are you okay?

17:55.175 --> 17:57.108
Oh, oh, yes, Sir Gareth.

17:57.210 --> 18:01.312
It's me, the princess.
And I'm enjoying the match.

18:01.414 --> 18:05.116
It's-it's-it's fun,
with a splash of weird.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.487
- Even sick, you have
the voice of an angel.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.057
Of course, that-that baby
mermaid also ate my eardrum.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.436
- Ooh, tough break.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.739
- Broken net.
Nigel's out.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.808
It's down to Sage and Ciarra.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.813
- I thought this
would be complicated,

18:35.915 --> 18:37.882
but it's actually
going really well.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.784
- I demand to see my daughter.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.085
- Spoke too soon.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.226
Step aside.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.695
I heard my baby girl has
bubble gut, and I must see her.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.964
- Oh, uh, my King, you
don't want to see that.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.332
She's been ripping
major belches in there.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.502
- Open the bubble gut hut!

19:01.441 --> 19:03.508
- Oops, I just
triple knotted it.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.978
- You said "oops," but you
clearly did that on purpose.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.779
Guards, arrest him!

19:20.093 --> 19:21.392
- Wazow!

19:30.670 --> 19:32.236
You missed again!

19:32.338 --> 19:34.172
- Did I?
I got your magic shell.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.507
Oh, oh, poop deck.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.947
- Without her magic shell,
the hag is powerless.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.315
- Ciarra's about to win!

19:44.417 --> 19:47.018
- Go, bestie!
Snag that hag!

19:49.622 --> 19:51.722
- Wazow, ow, ow!

19:54.060 --> 19:56.260
- You're going to the dungeon.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.729
- The dungeon?

20:01.267 --> 20:03.501
Whoopsie!
I better go get that.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.571
- She really Warwicked that.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.540
- Hey!

20:10.610 --> 20:11.943
Ow!

20:12.045 --> 20:14.111
Oh, you've captured the hag.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.548
- Sage wins the Roxbury Cup!

20:19.285 --> 20:21.953
- Buttercup, we
actually beat Ciarra!

20:22.055 --> 20:23.588
Happy dance!

20:27.193 --> 20:28.326
- Take him away.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.195
- Wait!
I asked him to guard my hut.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.397
Dad, tell your
guards to free, uh...

20:33.499 --> 20:36.200
what-what's your name?
Fart?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.303
- It's Arc.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.043
- Honey, are you
still feeling sick?

20:46.145 --> 20:47.378
- Uh, nope.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.180
I was cured by thinking about

20:49.282 --> 20:51.282
how lucky I am
to have you as a dad.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.552
- Aww, honey!

20:56.489 --> 20:58.589
Bring me the I'm not
crying, you're crying crown.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.264
Nobody look at me!

21:11.571 --> 21:13.504
- Wait, Arc, you
talked to the princess?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.940
- Yeah, I put in a good
word for you, buddy.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.409
- Which word?
Pants?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.980
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry
you lost, Ciarra.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.749
- It's okay.
I'm fine.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.219
Arc helped me realize
winning isn't everything.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.021
- Wow, no one in this squad

21:30.123 --> 21:31.856
has ever been able
to do that before.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.825
- Good job, new guy.
- Yeah.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.862
Thanks to Arc, our team's
never been stronger.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.665
That's all I wanted to hear.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.267
Squad hug!

21:45.972 --> 21:48.739
- Eew, who smells
like dolphin barf?

21:48.841 --> 21:51.642
That would be me.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.646
- Well, what the heck?
