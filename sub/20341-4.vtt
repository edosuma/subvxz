(muffled)
Let it go, Rolly!

01:07.250 --> 01:08.750
(grunts, muffled)
You let go!

01:09.750 --> 01:11.333
-Ow!
-Oof!

01:11.333 --> 01:14.333
Looks like the stick
let go of us! (laughs)

01:14.333 --> 01:17.583
-Hey there, dog-stars!
-Both: Bob!

01:17.583 --> 01:19.416
(both barking)

01:19.416 --> 01:23.208
Well, it looks like
you two are in the mood
for a fetch-filled day.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.333
But I've got something better
than a drippy old stick!

01:26.333 --> 01:28.708
-(clatters)
-I invented it just for you!

01:32.125 --> 01:34.583
I call it
the Go-Long Retriever!

01:34.583 --> 01:35.958
It looks like a stick!

01:35.958 --> 01:37.166
Probably more
than a stick,

01:37.166 --> 01:40.875
although I'd be pretty happy
if all it was was a stick.

01:40.875 --> 01:44.416
I've already started over
on several versions
of this invention,

01:44.416 --> 01:45.583
because they weren't
working right.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.875
-I hope this is the one
that finally works.
-(clicks)

01:47.875 --> 01:49.708
Go-Long:
Play fetch with me!

01:50.833 --> 01:52.833
(laughs)

01:52.833 --> 01:54.375
(boings)

01:56.291 --> 01:58.333
Play fetch with me!

01:58.333 --> 02:01.416
Did that stick
just throw... itself?

02:01.416 --> 02:05.416
Yeah, so somebody needs
to bring it back!

02:07.125 --> 02:09.958
-I got it!
-Rolly: I was here first!

02:09.958 --> 02:11.458
(laughs)
Good job!

02:11.458 --> 02:14.000
Now, let's see if it does
what it's supposed to do

02:14.000 --> 02:16.208
if you don't bring it back.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.291
Play fetch with me!
(boings)

02:21.500 --> 02:22.875
Hey!

02:22.875 --> 02:24.583
Play fetch with me!

02:27.333 --> 02:31.458
Ha-ha! Yippidy-dog!
I think this one's
a keeper!

02:31.458 --> 02:34.458
When that stick
lands somewhere
where you can't get it,

02:34.458 --> 02:37.875
it's supposed to come
right back to wherever
you are, and it did!

02:37.875 --> 02:39.750
-(watch alarm chimes)
-Oh no, I'm late for work!

02:39.750 --> 02:43.875
I always lose track
of time when I'm playing
with my best friends.

02:43.875 --> 02:46.000
Play fetch with me!
(boings)

02:46.000 --> 02:47.958
(leaves rustle)

02:48.958 --> 02:50.333
There it goes again.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.000
Now watch it come
right back!

02:53.000 --> 02:54.416
Hmm?

02:56.458 --> 02:59.333
Hmm. It shouldn't
be taking that long.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.708
This one must not
be working right either.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.333
Oh, well. It was fun
while it lasted.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.458
Well, if I find it later,
I guess I'll just have
to start over

03:07.458 --> 03:10.375
on a whole new version
of my invention... again!

03:10.375 --> 03:12.875
See ya later,
doggy-dudes!

03:12.875 --> 03:14.750
-(door opens)
-Too bad about that stick.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.083
-It seemed
real nice... for a stick.
-(door closes)

03:17.083 --> 03:19.375
I wonder why
it didn't come back.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.875
-(boings)
-(meows)

03:23.166 --> 03:24.708
(spits, sputters)

03:24.708 --> 03:28.458
-Your stick's back.
-Play fetch with me!

03:28.458 --> 03:30.333
How about if I chew
on you first?

03:30.333 --> 03:32.375
'Cause, well,
that's what I do.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.750
Nom-nom-nom!

03:33.750 --> 03:35.875
Rolly, Bob said
he needed to start over

03:35.875 --> 03:37.416
with a new version
of his invention,

03:37.416 --> 03:40.458
so maybe we should
help him by getting rid
of this one for him!

03:40.458 --> 03:42.958
(whimsical music playing)

03:46.958 --> 03:50.416
-(muffled) Bye-bye, stick.
-It's been nice gnawing you.

03:50.416 --> 03:53.000
Play fetch with me!

03:56.208 --> 03:57.458
(trash can opens)

03:57.458 --> 03:59.333
Play fetch with me!

04:00.416 --> 04:01.750
(laughs)
No, you silly stick.

04:01.750 --> 04:05.208
(laughs)
We're trying
to get rid of you!

04:08.333 --> 04:10.458
Play fetch with me!

04:11.416 --> 04:15.583
Get ready to go
really long, Go-Long.

04:15.583 --> 04:18.250
-(laughs)
-(both grunt)

04:18.250 --> 04:20.000
Blast-off!

04:22.291 --> 04:23.583
-(clatters)
-We did it!

04:23.583 --> 04:25.375
-Yeah!
-(boings)

04:25.375 --> 04:27.166
Play fetch with me!

04:27.166 --> 04:29.750
-I guess we didn't do it.
-Nope.

04:29.750 --> 04:33.000
What are we
gonna do with you,
you stickity stick?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.333
I know what we're gonna do.
We're going on a mission,

04:35.333 --> 04:39.250
and we're not coming back
until that stick's not
coming back, either!

Ah-ah-ahem!
The perfect place
to get rid of what?

05:31.250 --> 05:34.708

Bob made it to do.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.583
Well, then I changed my mind.
I don't want it.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.875
Rufus, let go of that stick!

06:21.291 --> 06:24.166

07:36.250 --> 07:38.833

I'm a dog who loves
chasing sticks,

07:50.833 --> 07:53.291
but I never thought I'd be

07:53.291 --> 07:54.833
Play fetch with me!

07:55.833 --> 07:57.708
Play fetch with me!

08:01.000 --> 08:04.500
Come on! That stick won't
be able to find us
if we hide in there.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.875

Won't that stick just go
"boingity, boing, boing, boing"

08:24.125 --> 08:26.458
in here and then we'll have
to run away again?

08:26.458 --> 08:28.083
No, it's a blow-up bouncy house.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.875
Pointy things
aren't allowed in here.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.625
There's a sign outside
that says so.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.708
Bow to the wow,
Bingo, we did it!

08:33.708 --> 08:35.500
Hey, can I jump for joy?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.750
We're in a bouncy house.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.875
You can jump
for whatever you want.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.375
-Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

08:43.375 --> 08:46.000
-(hissing)
-What's that sound?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.125
The bouncy house
is losing its air!

08:51.333 --> 08:53.375
Like it was poked
with something.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.500
Poked with something
like a stick!

08:55.500 --> 08:56.958
Play fetch with me!

08:56.958 --> 09:01.333
-Both:
It's in the bouncy house!
-Play fetch with me!

09:01.333 --> 09:04.125
A bouncy house is
no place for a pointy stick!

09:04.125 --> 09:07.458
-Yeah, that sign said so!
-Play fetch with me!

09:09.083 --> 09:10.583
Play fetch with me!

09:11.583 --> 09:13.750
-(kids cheer)
-Yay! Yahoo!

09:15.708 --> 09:17.875

09:17.875 --> 09:19.625
Go-Long:
Play fetch with me!

09:20.625 --> 09:23.500
Oops!
We can't go this way!

09:23.500 --> 09:25.875
Play fetch with me!

09:25.875 --> 09:28.708
Can't you just, please,
stop trying to come back to us?

09:28.708 --> 09:31.458
Yeah, we want to get out
of this sticky situation!

09:31.458 --> 09:33.875
-(drum rimshot)
-(water flowing)

09:33.875 --> 09:35.958
Rolly, are you strong enough
to lift this wood?

09:35.958 --> 09:38.458
I'm strong enough
to lift anything.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.708
Wait for my signal.
I'll say, "Now!"

09:40.708 --> 09:43.250
-Not yet.
-But you said, "Now."

09:43.250 --> 09:45.833
I'll say, "Now,"
when I want you to lift it.

09:45.833 --> 09:46.708
You just said it again.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.458
I didn't mean now
when I said it just now.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.583
I'll say, "Now,"
when I mean, "Now!"

09:51.583 --> 09:53.250
-(boinging)
-Not yet.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.750
Not yet. Now!

09:55.750 --> 09:58.833
-"Now" for real "now"?
-"Now" for real "now"!

09:58.833 --> 10:00.083

10:00.083 --> 10:01.708

10:01.708 --> 10:03.833
Go-Long:
Play fetch with me!

10:03.833 --> 10:06.375
We did it, Rolly!
That stick is gone!

10:06.375 --> 10:09.625
Good, because I really
don't want to play anymore.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.458
(sighs) I don't want
to see another stick
as long as I live.

10:16.458 --> 10:19.875
Me neither,
but at least we did
what Bob wanted us to do.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.875
Yeah. When we want
to get rid of something,

10:21.875 --> 10:23.500
-we get it gotten rid of.
-(knocks on door)

10:23.500 --> 10:25.000
-Both: Huh?
-(knocks)

10:25.000 --> 10:27.875
I hear a "knock-knock,"
but I don't want to say,
"Who's there?"

10:27.875 --> 10:30.166
(knocks)
Play fetch with me!

10:30.166 --> 10:32.458

That's who
I thought was there.

10:32.458 --> 10:36.000
Stay away from us, stick!
You were supposed to stay away!

10:36.000 --> 10:39.125
-Rolly: It's getting inside!
-Play fetch with me!

10:40.125 --> 10:44.000
-Play fetch with me!
-This way! Run!

10:44.000 --> 10:46.708
-Faster!
-We're already going faster!

10:46.708 --> 10:48.708
(both grunt, thud)

10:50.750 --> 10:53.708
Listen.
It stopped knocking.

10:53.708 --> 10:56.250
-(Go-Long boings)
-It came around
the other side!

10:56.250 --> 10:57.625
Play fetch with me!

10:57.625 --> 11:00.375
-Who put all this stuff here?
-We did.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.833
Well, now we need
to put it back!

11:01.833 --> 11:04.208
-(door opens)
-(both scream)

11:04.208 --> 11:05.875
(toy squeaks)

11:05.875 --> 11:09.500
Whatcha doing?
Are you two having
a doggy-house day?

11:09.500 --> 11:10.625
-It's Bob!
-Bob!

11:10.625 --> 11:14.250
(grunts, laughs)
Hey!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.875
-Bob, you're you!
-You're home! It's you!

11:15.875 --> 11:19.833
Whoa, I'm super-duper happy
to see you, too!

11:19.833 --> 11:23.250
Hey! The Go-Long Retriever
finally came back!

11:23.250 --> 11:26.000
And it looks like
you've been playing
with it all day.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
I better take this one back
to the shop to make sure
its still working right.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.625
(clicks)

11:31.625 --> 11:34.750
-(barks)
-(laughs) Not tired
of fetch yet, huh?

11:34.750 --> 11:37.458
How about we try
the real thing this time?

11:37.458 --> 11:40.833
Go long, boys,
go long!
(laughs)

11:40.833 --> 11:43.083
Race ya back!
The long way!

11:46.958 --> 11:47.708
(laughs)

11:50.000 --> 11:52.291
-(clicks)
-(boings)
Play fetch with me!

11:52.291 --> 11:53.875
Uh, no, thanks.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.708
(boings)
Play fetch with me!

11:56.708 --> 11:59.000
Uh, don't really want to.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Play fetch with me!

12:05.208 --> 12:06.625
Hmm?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.458
Play fetch with me!

12:08.458 --> 12:11.083
(both scream)

12:11.083 --> 12:14.000
-Play fetch with me!
-Cupcake: Get away!
Get away! Get away!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.583
Get away!
No! Get away!

12:17.458 --> 12:20.083
(Bingo speaks)

12:20.083 --> 12:23.750
Ow! Move your paw, Rolly.
It's poking me in the stomach.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.875
That's not my paw!
That's your paw!

12:25.875 --> 12:27.958
It is? Oh.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.583
Which one of our backsides
is in front of my face?

12:32.583 --> 12:33.833
Lemme find out.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.708
-Is it wiggling?
-Yep.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.708
-It's mine!
-Bob: Guys, come take
a look at this!

12:39.708 --> 12:41.208
What is it, Bob?

12:41.208 --> 12:43.458
(both barking)

12:47.875 --> 12:49.708
(laughs)
Check out this video!

12:49.708 --> 12:52.500
-(surfing music plays)
-It's a puppy on waterskis!

12:52.500 --> 12:54.958
(laughs)
Look at that doggy go!

12:54.958 --> 12:56.250
(poofs)

12:56.250 --> 12:57.500
-(music slows, stops)
-(clatters)

13:00.000 --> 13:04.083
-Hey, where'd the doggy go?
-(gasp) My computer!

13:04.083 --> 13:05.708
Oh darn, it's broken.

13:05.708 --> 13:08.875
And these things
are expensive to fix.

13:08.875 --> 13:13.000
I bet it costs me
a pot of gold to get
this thing working again.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.875
Well, I guess I'll have to worry
about fixing my computer later.

13:16.875 --> 13:21.708
But at least I can look
forward to seeing you two
when I get home from work!

13:23.375 --> 13:24.875
Enjoy your nap, Hissy.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.500
And the nap
after your other naps.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.375
-(meows)
-(door opens, closes)

13:29.375 --> 13:34.000
Poor Bob. I wish we could
find him that pot of gold
in order to fix his computer.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.083
Yeah, 'cause we're really good
at finding things.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.708
Like, I always know
exactly where my tail is!

13:38.708 --> 13:41.208
Wait! Where'd it go?
There it is.

13:41.208 --> 13:44.166
Where'd it go?
There it is. Where'd it go?

13:44.166 --> 13:45.958
Watch it!

13:45.958 --> 13:48.125
-(beeps)
-Man on TV: There will be
rain and sunshine today,

13:48.125 --> 13:51.000
which means there
will also be rainbows.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And if you find
the end of the rainbow,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.958
be sure to grab
that pot of gold!

13:54.958 --> 13:57.083
Rolly, did you hear
what he said?

13:57.083 --> 13:59.250
Bob needs a pot of gold
to fix his computer,

13:59.250 --> 14:01.625
and we can find one
at the end of the rainbow.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.291
Hissy:
That's just a legend.

14:03.291 --> 14:06.958
-Bingo: What is?
-That at the end of every
rainbow there's a pot of gold.

14:06.958 --> 14:12.166
Well, Rolly and I are going
to find exactly what Bob needs
to fix his computer, so come on!

14:14.125 --> 14:17.000
This is our mission, Rolly.
First we're gonna
find a rainbow,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.375
then we're gonna find the pot
of gold at the end of it.

14:19.375 --> 14:22.083
And then we'll take it to Bob,
and he can fix his computer,

14:22.083 --> 14:24.458
and we'll be able to look
at that doggy waterski.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.125
(gasping)

14:26.125 --> 14:28.166
Puddles!

14:30.458 --> 14:33.875
(laughing)

14:33.875 --> 14:38.166
(grunts) Arr!
I'm a splishy-splash monster!

14:42.375 --> 14:45.375
I guess I'm also
a sinky-winky monster.

14:45.375 --> 14:48.583
-(shudders)
-(laughs)

14:48.583 --> 14:50.708
Rolly, look,
there's the rainbow!

14:50.708 --> 14:52.416
(trolley bell dings)

14:52.416 --> 14:55.625
Let's go find the pot of gold
at the end of that thing!

14:59.000 --> 15:01.375
It looks like the rainbow
ends behind that factory,

15:01.375 --> 15:04.708
so all we have to do is go
through those front doors
and out the back.

15:04.708 --> 15:07.833
If we can get past that
big, scary guard dog, first.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.625
The big, scary what?

15:09.625 --> 15:11.958
(growling)

15:11.958 --> 15:14.500
Looks like our mission
just got a whole lot harder.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.708
Yeah, how are we going
to get through that place

15:16.708 --> 15:19.708
-and to the pot of gold
without being seen?
-I don't know.

15:19.708 --> 15:22.208
But we know
someone who does.

15:22.208 --> 15:27.250
Oh, sure, I know that factory.
I collect stuff other people
throw away,

15:27.250 --> 15:30.708
and when this friend
of mine found plans
for that place in the trash...

15:30.708 --> 15:35.083
-he gave 'em to me.
-I knew Bulworth would
be able to help us.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.708
Junkyard dogs
are the best!

15:36.708 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, yeah. Now put
those snouts to work, will ya?

15:44.125 --> 15:48.458
See that ditch right there?
You want to crawl through
that to the front door.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.500
Then, when you're
inside the factory,

15:50.500 --> 15:53.750
you're gonna
ride this conveyor belt
through the assembly room.

15:53.750 --> 15:57.000
-A ride?
That sounds fun!
-Hey!

15:58.375 --> 16:01.750
Hey, it's not an amusement park,
so don't dilly-dally.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.833
I won't dilly... or dally.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.083
Then you've got to make it
through the wrapping room,

16:06.083 --> 16:09.875
take a shortcut
through this hallway,
and exit out the back.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.875
Stay out of trouble,
and that pot of gold'll
be yours.

16:12.875 --> 16:16.125
Don't worry, Bulworth.
Nothing is going to trip us up.

16:16.125 --> 16:19.208
(screams)
Hello?

16:19.208 --> 16:20.125
(laughs)

16:21.166 --> 16:22.708
Bulworth was right.

16:22.708 --> 16:25.333
We can walk through this ditch
all the way to the front door.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.083
Let's go!

16:31.458 --> 16:33.291
Either the water's
getting deeper

16:33.291 --> 16:34.833
or my legs are getting shorter.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.291
Stay down.
I'm gonna take a peek

16:36.291 --> 16:38.291
and see where
that guard dog is.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.125
(blowing bubbles)

16:43.875 --> 16:46.375
(ominous music plays)

16:46.375 --> 16:47.583
(growls)

16:47.583 --> 16:50.958
Deep breath, Rolly.
Deep breath!

16:58.583 --> 17:00.875
-(both inhale deeply)
-Is he gone?

17:00.875 --> 17:03.875
Yeah, and there's
the front door, so come on!

17:05.250 --> 17:07.000
(shudders)

17:09.833 --> 17:11.750
Whoa!

17:11.750 --> 17:14.333
I know Bulworth said
that this wasn't
an amusement park,

17:14.333 --> 17:15.708
but it looks as fun as one!

17:15.708 --> 17:17.875
Okay, first thing we're
supposed to do is

17:17.875 --> 17:19.708
ride the conveyor belt
into the next room.

17:19.708 --> 17:23.708
Then next room?
Here we come!

17:27.375 --> 17:29.750
Bingo, why are
you going that way?

17:29.750 --> 17:32.708
I don't know.
Why are you going that way?

17:35.416 --> 17:36.708
Uh, where'd you go?

17:37.708 --> 17:39.750
Both: Jump!
(grunting)

17:41.500 --> 17:44.875
Jump, Rolly, jump!

17:46.208 --> 17:48.291
-(grunts)
-I've got you!

17:49.208 --> 17:51.625
-Thanks for the paw.
-Any time.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.125
Bulworth said this next room
is called the wrapping room.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.333
What happens
in the wrapping room?

17:56.333 --> 17:58.875
-(hissing)
-(both yelps)

18:00.458 --> 18:01.750
That happens.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.375
-Whoa!
-Falling!

18:03.375 --> 18:05.000
(both thud)

18:05.000 --> 18:09.083
Well, now I know
what an upside-down
turtle feels like.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.416
(grunts)

18:11.416 --> 18:15.458
These bubbles
are wrapped around us
so tight we can't walk!

18:15.458 --> 18:18.291
And if we can't walk,
we'll never get to the end
of the rainbow

18:18.291 --> 18:21.208
and find
that pot of gold for Bob,
which is our mission!

18:21.208 --> 18:25.416
Then you and I
need to get unwrapped.
And I know just how to do it.

18:25.416 --> 18:27.333
(record scratches)

18:27.333 --> 18:29.708
-♪ We've been bubble wrapped ♪
-♪ And we're in trouble ♪

18:29.708 --> 18:31.500

19:06.708 --> 19:08.375
We did it, Rolly!
We did it!

19:08.375 --> 19:10.958
Yeah, I just wish
there was more bubble wrap
for us to pop,

19:10.958 --> 19:13.958
'cause I could play
with that stuff all day!

19:13.958 --> 19:15.125
(giggles)

19:18.333 --> 19:20.458
Rolly, did you do that
on purpose?

19:20.458 --> 19:24.583
-Maybe.
-Well, then, we're just gonna
have to pop all of it!

19:24.583 --> 19:27.625
-Yeah! Yahoo!
-(popping)

19:30.250 --> 19:33.291
They should put bubble wrap
on every floor, everywhere.

19:33.291 --> 19:38.083
-That'd make
walking a lot more fun.
-(whispers) Rolly, wait!

19:38.083 --> 19:40.750
The guard dog
is right outside.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.500
If he hears us
popping bubbles,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.416
he'll catch us
and ruin our mission.

19:45.416 --> 19:47.166
But how are we going
to get down the hallway

19:47.166 --> 19:49.708
without going
"Poppity, pop-pop-pop"?

19:49.708 --> 19:52.250
We'll have to walk
between the bubbles.

20:01.125 --> 20:02.875
(growls)

20:07.125 --> 20:09.333
-(pops)
-(growls)

20:12.875 --> 20:15.375
Okay, Rolly, your turn,

20:15.375 --> 20:17.958
but you need to follow
my exact steps.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.875
-That'll be easy.
I watched you really close...
-(fly buzzing)

20:20.875 --> 20:24.166
...so I'd know
where to step and--
Hey, look, a fly!

20:24.166 --> 20:25.500
Rolly, no!

20:25.500 --> 20:28.083
I'm gonna get you,
you flip-flappy fly!

20:34.458 --> 20:35.833
(snarls)

20:37.458 --> 20:39.583
(laughs)
Ooh! Ugh!

20:42.458 --> 20:46.166
That was amazing!
You missed every single bubble!

20:46.166 --> 20:47.875
But I didn't catch
one single fly.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.708
Forget the fly!
We're almost to Bob's
pot of gold.

20:50.708 --> 20:54.708
Someday I want
to go on a mission looking
for a pot of flies.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.458
We made it
through the factory!

20:58.458 --> 21:01.458
And now that we're in the back,
we should be able to see...

21:01.458 --> 21:03.958
(gasps)
Whoa!

21:03.958 --> 21:06.416
The rainbow
and the pot of gold!

21:06.416 --> 21:08.458
But where's the pot?

21:08.458 --> 21:10.708
I don't know.
Maybe there was
too much gold to fit in it

21:10.708 --> 21:13.333
or somebody took it
in order to make spaghetti.

21:13.333 --> 21:17.166
Well, this is what
Bob said he needed
to fix his computer, so...

21:17.166 --> 21:19.458
Get away
from that pile!

21:19.458 --> 21:22.625
Dogs aren't allowed
back here.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.208
Well, you're back here.

21:26.458 --> 21:30.708
Dogs other than me
aren't allowed back here.

21:30.708 --> 21:32.458
What do we do, Bingo?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.833
I don't know.
Bulworth never said
what to do

21:34.833 --> 21:37.625
if the scary-looking dog
actually saw us.

21:37.625 --> 21:41.125
Bulworth?
You two know Bulworth?

21:41.125 --> 21:43.458
Yeah, he's one
of our best friends.

21:43.458 --> 21:46.458
-Mine, too.
-You're a friend
of Bulworth's?

21:46.458 --> 21:50.708
I am. I love how
that guy collects stuff
that's being thrown away.

21:50.708 --> 21:53.458
So when I found the plans
for this factory in the trash,

21:53.458 --> 21:54.750
I gave them to him.

21:54.750 --> 21:57.125
And he showed us
those plans to help us get

21:57.125 --> 21:59.208
to the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.625
And here it is!
Well, without the pot,

22:01.625 --> 22:03.625
because somebody might
be making spaghetti in it.

22:03.625 --> 22:07.958
That pile is where
they toss the old parts
from last year's computers.

22:07.958 --> 22:09.333
Would it be okay if we took some

22:09.333 --> 22:10.583
of that gold home for Bob?

22:10.583 --> 22:11.708
Take whatever you want.

22:11.708 --> 22:13.708
It's all gonna
be thrown out, anyway.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.458
Hey, I should give some
to Bulworth.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.000
That'd make his tail wag.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.708
(chuckles)
Yeah, that dog loves
his garbage.

22:20.708 --> 22:23.125
-See ya, fellas!
-See ya! Thanks!

22:24.458 --> 22:25.875
Bingo:
We did it, Hissy.

22:25.875 --> 22:28.458
We found
the end of the rainbow
and the pot of gold,

22:28.458 --> 22:31.458
even though there wasn't a pot,
but there was nothing but gold!

22:31.458 --> 22:34.958
Wait a minute,
you mean there actually
was something there?

22:34.958 --> 22:36.708
Yep, and we brought it
back here.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.333
Put that stuff
on Bob's desk, Rolly.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.625
He'll be so happy
when he finds that gold here.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.083
-(mumbles)
It's just what he needs!
-(door opens, closes)

22:44.083 --> 22:45.375
Bob's home!

22:45.375 --> 22:47.291
(both barking)

22:47.291 --> 22:49.375
Hey, there, puppies!

22:49.375 --> 22:50.625
We found the gold, Bob.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.583
At the end
of the rainbow!

22:51.583 --> 22:54.458
Did you have lots of fun
while I was gone?

22:54.458 --> 22:56.583
Hey, what's that
under my desk?

22:59.708 --> 23:02.458
Look at this!
It must have fallen out

23:02.458 --> 23:03.750
of my computer
this morning,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.250
but I didn't see it.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.750
(laughs)
It works!

23:06.750 --> 23:10.458
Because the two of us
found the gold. High paw!

23:10.458 --> 23:14.583
Now we can watch
the rest of that puppy dog
waterskiing video.

23:14.583 --> 23:18.583
-(surf music playing)
-I gotta say, that is
one special dog.

23:18.583 --> 23:21.625
But you know what?
There aren't any dogs

23:21.625 --> 23:24.125
who are
more special than you.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.416
(laughs)

23:26.416 --> 23:28.291
Aw, come on!

23:32.500 --> 23:34.458
(theme music
playing)

23:35.708 --> 23:37.208
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.291 --> 23:42.458
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.708 --> 23:45.708
(record scratching)

23:52.166 --> 23:53.166
Bark!

23:57.000 --> 23:58.625
Bark! Bark! Bark!
