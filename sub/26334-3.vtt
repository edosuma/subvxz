♪

00:08.617 --> 00:10.097
Pretty lucky,
you know that?

00:10.140 --> 00:12.186
Lucky? My wife shot me.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.231
Well, it's above your shoulder
and it's barely a flesh wound.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.798
An inch down, it would've
stopped your heart,

00:15.841 --> 00:16.886
so, yeah, you're lucky.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.453
Well, here's
to my wife's bad aim.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.671
From the looks
of this place, you two had

00:19.715 --> 00:21.151
a pretty heated argument, huh?

00:21.195 --> 00:24.067
My wife's a good person
with a bad drinking problem

00:24.111 --> 00:26.461
and even worse jealous streak.

00:26.504 --> 00:29.116
Anything in particular happen
to activate that jealous streak?

00:29.159 --> 00:30.421
She thought the girl
behind the counter

00:30.465 --> 00:32.075
at the bodega
was flirting with me.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.816
Okay.Day before,
it was some woman

00:33.859 --> 00:34.860
on the subway.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.253
Day before that,
it was our waitress.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.559
Should I keep going?

00:37.602 --> 00:38.908
Okay, she's got
a jealous streak.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.214
We get it. Where is she now?

00:40.257 --> 00:42.825
She ran out the second
I called 911.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.174
I tried to
stop her, but...

00:44.218 --> 00:45.784
Any idea where
she might go?

00:45.828 --> 00:49.571
Like I said,
she's got a drinking problem.

00:49.614 --> 00:52.226
Any particular watering hole
she'd go to?

00:52.269 --> 00:53.966
Any hole with water.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.109
Hey, got a minute?
Nope.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.371
Oh, okay.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.765
But for you, I will make one.
What's going on?

01:09.808 --> 01:11.767
Well, they got me on
this Costello robbery.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.856
Bad guy robbed an old lady
on her way home

01:13.899 --> 01:15.249
from the
grocery store.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.294
Wait, didn't
they tell you?
Tell me what?

01:17.338 --> 01:20.210
I'm knocking that down
to a misdemeanor petty larceny.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.429
What

01:21.472 --> 01:24.214
Because I've got 500
other cases ahead of it

01:24.258 --> 01:26.129
that need our time
and resources.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.131
Ahead of an old lady
getting robbed?
No.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.611
What I mean is,
there is no case.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.134
It's her word against his.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.267
There's no weapon,
there's no surveillance footage.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.051
He's a first-time offender.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.140
The judge will give me the
stink eye before I even get,

01:37.184 --> 01:39.142
"Good morning, Your Honor,"
out of my mouth.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.840
So you're gonna cut bait?Yeah, that's my job.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.146
That's your new job.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.148
Do you have a problem
with my new position?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.629
Only that the old Erin would've
clotheslined this new Erin

01:47.672 --> 01:50.545
in a steel cage match
to see this case through.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.558
This new guy Reagan's more
Boy Scout than NYPD.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.864
Gave me a rip 'cause I wasn't
wearing my flashlight

02:05.908 --> 02:07.127
during the day.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.520
Exactly.
Sarge is handing out CD's

02:09.564 --> 02:11.522
like demerits back in
Catholic school.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.874
I pass him this morning,
I say under my breath,

02:15.918 --> 02:18.747
"Is that a stick up your butt
or you just happy to see me?"

02:18.790 --> 02:20.140
Now I'm working midnights.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.229
What you get when your
old man's the Commissioner.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.927
He's not the first boss who
thought he could change the 2-9.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.234
Bide your time, boys.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.279
I give it about a month
before he's begging Daddy

02:29.323 --> 02:31.368
for a transfer out of here.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.247
You really think
I'm gonna say that?

02:40.290 --> 02:42.379
I'm starting to think
maybe not?

02:42.423 --> 02:43.859
Definitely not.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.034
Perhaps you could say that,

02:45.077 --> 02:46.949
while you appreciate
Istanbul's offer,

02:46.992 --> 02:48.907
you are unable to accept

02:48.951 --> 02:50.822
the police chief's
invitation at present.

02:52.955 --> 02:56.045
Or just say that
you're under the weather.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.178
Why don't you just
tell the truth?

02:58.221 --> 03:00.571
That Istanbul's police
practices make you long

03:00.615 --> 03:02.965
for good old-fashioned
martial law.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.575
Where's Garrett?

03:04.619 --> 03:08.275
He's held up at the Bed-Stuy
community outreach town hall.

03:08.318 --> 03:12.496
What are you gonna say
when you talk to Istanbul?

03:12.540 --> 03:13.584
I don't know.

03:13.628 --> 03:16.457
I'm at my best
when I just wing it.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.415
But boss? I'm betting
this guy's seen

03:18.459 --> 03:21.244
every duck and heard
every excuse ever invented.

03:21.288 --> 03:24.116
Well, maybe I can
come up with a new one.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.989
Commissioner,
this is a code red.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.992
We have a credible threat.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.255
Please step away
from the window.

03:52.971 --> 03:57.019
Commissioner Reagan, if you
would confirm your identity.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.629
Welcome to Bravo Bunker.

03:58.673 --> 03:59.630
GORMLEY:
Bravo Bunker?

03:59.674 --> 04:01.415
Thank you, Chief.Commissioner.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.939
Can I ask where we are?Bravo Bunker.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.767
Yeah, we got the name.
What is this place?

04:05.810 --> 04:08.335
This is where we go
when everywhere else is a no-go.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.553
And has that happened?

04:09.597 --> 04:11.381
Commissioner,
your computer is online

04:11.425 --> 04:14.776
and your secure phone
is confirmed and ready for use.

04:14.819 --> 04:19.041
Thank you, Inspector.
How'd we do?

04:19.084 --> 04:23.001
Record best time
for the weekday scenario.

04:23.045 --> 04:26.918
Good. Well done, everyone.
At ease.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.269
Boss, I'm definitely
not at ease.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.271
So we're not under attack?

04:31.314 --> 04:34.361
No, this was just a drill,

04:34.404 --> 04:36.058
but had there been an attack,

04:36.101 --> 04:37.973
you would've followed
the same procedure.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.148
This place
is no joke.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.715
We're fully operational here.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.761
Pretty much anything we do
at 1PP, we can do here.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.503
Except order pizza in.

AZOULAY:
In order to access

04:49.027 --> 04:50.638
this building,
you'll need this card.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.074
Keep it on you
at all times.

04:52.117 --> 04:55.120
And you can't even tell

04:55.164 --> 04:57.384
your priest about this place.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.386
If you don't see them
in this room,

04:59.429 --> 05:01.126
you can't talk to them about it.

05:02.519 --> 05:06.349
Why are we on the list
all of a sudden, may I ask?

05:09.744 --> 05:10.962
No.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.747
No, we're not on the list?

05:14.401 --> 05:17.142
No, you may not ask.

05:19.144 --> 05:22.234
♪

05:45.649 --> 05:46.911
Anything?

05:46.955 --> 05:48.739
Wife's name
is Clara Hayes.
Uh-huh.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.612
She's gone. Vanished.
No online activity.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.788
No hits on the license plate
readers. Nothing.

05:53.831 --> 05:54.789
She'll show up.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.878
Why don't you seem more worried?

05:56.921 --> 05:59.533
Because her last ATM transaction
was three days ago.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.708
She withdrew $100.

06:00.751 --> 06:01.883
When that runs out,
she's gonna have to

06:01.926 --> 06:03.493
use the card again
or her credit card,

06:03.537 --> 06:04.494
and when that happens,

06:04.538 --> 06:05.756
this phone's gonna ring.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.150
But you heard her husband,
she's a drunk.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.108
What if she's passed out
in some alley somewhere?

06:10.152 --> 06:12.197
If she's passed out
in an alley somewhere,

06:12.241 --> 06:14.374
she's gonna wake up eventually,
and when she does,

06:14.417 --> 06:17.420
she's gonna want some food
or, most likely, another drink.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.162
I think we should check
the emergency rooms.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.381
Already did.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.991
And the homeless shelters

06:23.034 --> 06:24.993
Reagan.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.823
Yeah, what do
you got?

06:28.866 --> 06:31.739
Yeah, the Edward Joseph Hotel
over there

06:31.782 --> 06:33.784
by the Queensboro Bridge,
I know it.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.439
You're kidding me.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.006
Thank you.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.835
She just opened up a tab
at a rooftop bar.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.227
I love rooftop bars.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.447
Me, too. Let's crash the party.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.805
Sorry I'm late, I...

07:12.562 --> 07:13.781
That's right.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.435
Start the paperwork.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.349
Mrs. Costello.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.916
Eh, let me
get back to you.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.919
Come in, come in.
Here, let me make some room.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.921
I'm sorry to bother you.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.097
It's no bother at all.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.100
You're still upset?

07:29.144 --> 07:31.886
I just don't understand.
I was assaulted.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.931
I was robbed.
The police

07:33.975 --> 07:35.933
saw the bump on my head,

07:35.977 --> 07:37.108
and then you're
telling me

07:37.152 --> 07:39.197
you're knocking my case
down to nothing.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.243
Look, I-I'll be honest with you,
Mrs. Costello,

07:41.286 --> 07:43.027
I-I feel exactly
the same way as you.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.987
So then why are you doing it?My hands are tied.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.903
The D.A.'s office decides which
cases they're gonna prosecute.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.818
It's not right, Anthony.

07:50.861 --> 07:53.255
Believe me, I know.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.171
You keep agreeing with me,
I'm gonna bop you on the head.

07:56.214 --> 07:57.825
At least fight with me.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.262
Here, come on, you can
punch me on the arm.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.438
Come on.
Oh.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.266
There, feel better?

08:04.309 --> 08:06.224
Nope.

08:06.268 --> 08:09.532
Look, I-I'm sorry,
Mrs. Costello, I really am.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.447
I don't know what
the world is coming to

08:11.491 --> 08:14.145
when a woman can be
held at gunpoint

08:14.189 --> 08:17.061
and there's not a damn thing
the city can do about it.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.236
Again, I-I'm...

08:18.280 --> 08:21.109
Wait, did you say
held up at gunpoint?

08:21.152 --> 08:22.240
That's right.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.720
There's no mention of a gun

08:23.764 --> 08:25.113
in the police report.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.593
Well, there should've been.

08:26.636 --> 08:29.987
That little rat held it
right here at my ribs.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.293
And you told the cops?

08:31.336 --> 08:32.599
Yes, I did.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.731
Well, somehow it didn't
make it into the report.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.603
Mrs. Costello,
this changes everything.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.213
It does?
Yeah.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.780
Uh, hell yeah.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.347
Now we got him on
a B violent felony.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.741
Is that good?
Very.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.221
Hi, this is

08:46.264 --> 08:48.876
Detective Abetemarco, I called
you about that prisoner.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.486
Do not release him.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.677
Anyone ever tell you
you look great in stripes?

09:07.721 --> 09:09.200
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.898
Um, what-what brings you
down here anyway?

09:10.941 --> 09:12.552
Nice to see you, too,
sweetheart.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.902
I just mean that
I wasn't expecting you.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.382
That's because
it was a surprise.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.428
Surprise!
Oh, thank you.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.430
Eggplant parmesan hero
from Di Palo's.
Whoa.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.824
Taste of the old neighborhood.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.608
That's really
nice of you.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.045
Is everything okay?
Sure.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.265
'Cause you don't seem okay
with me being here.

09:30.308 --> 09:31.266
I'm fine.
Really?

09:31.309 --> 09:32.223
'Cause I'm definitely getting

09:32.267 --> 09:33.442
a "not fine" vibe.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.271
Just working, Eddie.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.055
So how's it
going down here?

09:38.099 --> 09:40.188
You haven't really had
a chance to break it down.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.581
Good.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.061
Is the 2-9 really as tough
as they all say it is?

09:44.105 --> 09:46.281
Uh, busy. Lot of bad guys
on the streets,

09:46.324 --> 09:47.282
much busier than the 12th.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.327
What about off the streets?

09:49.371 --> 09:51.025
Hm?In the station house, I mean.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.766
Are you getting along
with th

09:52.809 --> 09:55.029
Well, I'm a sergeant now.Right.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.379
Means I'm not their buddy.Sure, but...

10:00.948 --> 10:01.905
But what?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.341
Nothing. You were right.

10:03.385 --> 10:07.258
I should get out
of your way. Um...

10:07.302 --> 10:08.738
Probably shouldn't
kiss you good

10:08.782 --> 10:10.566
I'll check in with you later.
Thank you for lunch.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.919
You wanted to see me, Sarge?Please.

10:24.406 --> 10:28.236
CAMBRIA: Clara,
whatever you think is so bad,

10:28.279 --> 10:31.718
I promise you is not so bad.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.937
:
I shot my husband.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.333
I tried to kill the only person
who ever loved me.

10:38.376 --> 10:42.076
The only man who ever
saw any good in me.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.468
DANNY:
I got an idea.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.687
You got your phone?Yeah.

10:44.731 --> 10:45.688
I want you to text me.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.907
What do you want me to say?

10:46.950 --> 10:49.126
I'm a drunk.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.954
I am worthless.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.608
CAMBRIA:
Take my hand

10:52.652 --> 10:54.218
and let's talk
about this inside.

10:54.262 --> 10:57.395
No, I'm not stupid. If I go
with you, you'll take to jail

10:57.439 --> 10:59.136
for attempted murder.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.268
DANNY:
You send it?

11:00.311 --> 11:01.225
Come on, come on, come on.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.226
Sent it.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.750
Tell Richard I'm sorry.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.447
Tell him he was right.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.275
I was never worthy of him.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.758
Clara! Don't do it!

11:12.584 --> 11:15.283
Clara! Look at me.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.414
Look at me, Clara.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.634
It doesn't have to be
a death sentence.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.376
Lieutenant.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.204
Can I try something?

11:23.247 --> 11:24.379
What do you got, Danny?

11:25.946 --> 11:28.775
Hey, Clara? I have someone here
that wants to speak to you.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.170
Clara?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.389
Detective Reagan.

11:34.432 --> 11:37.609
I was first on the scene
with your husband.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.872
How is he

11:38.915 --> 11:41.483
Richard's fine. Okay?
He's got a flesh wound,

11:41.526 --> 11:43.659
he's on his feet,
he'll be like new in no time.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.661
He hates me.No, he doesn't.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.271
He sent me with a message. Look.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.969
Look, come on, look at this.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.188
That's his words.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.585
He sent you that?

11:56.628 --> 11:58.761
He forgives you, okay?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.676
He wants you to be safe.
He loves you.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.374
Now let me get you
down from there,

12:03.418 --> 12:05.768
get you back to him, he can
tell you those words himself.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.121
All right?

12:15.865 --> 12:17.562
Okay?

12:17.606 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.043 --> 12:23.612
All right.

12:23.655 --> 12:26.484
:
I'm sorry.Okay. It's okay. Okay.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.530
It's all right.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.100
All right, all right.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.938
We got a positive ID...Yep.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.983
...a confession
from the shooter.Mm-hmm.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.419
You've got the weapon,

12:48.463 --> 12:51.031
and ballistics confirms
it's the gun.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.684
Yep.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.599
I'm sorry, what have you done
with my brother Danny Reagan?

12:54.643 --> 12:55.949
Always with the jokes.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.167
Well, can you blame me?
You usually come in here

12:57.211 --> 12:58.952
with a half-baked case
and a hunch.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.910
Today, you're walking in
with a royal flush.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.085
No, today, I walked in

13:02.129 --> 13:04.261
with a pair of twos
and three stragglers.

13:04.305 --> 13:05.480
What are you talking about?

13:05.523 --> 13:06.873
Eh, something's
not right about it.

13:06.916 --> 13:07.830
It's too easy.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.658
You are impossible.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.312
No, I'm serious.Let me guess.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.879
It's your gut.
No,

13:12.922 --> 13:14.445
it's not my gut, okay?

13:14.489 --> 13:17.057
I can't explain it, it just
doesn't pass the smell test.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.842
Then plug your nose,
because this is a slam dunk.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.452
You have a
defendant indicating

13:21.496 --> 13:22.758
she's gonna plead guilty.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.761
No, no. Do not let her do that.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.893
Okay. That's enough. Get out.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.024
No, I'm dead
serious, okay?

13:28.068 --> 13:30.026
At least not yet, anyway.

13:30.070 --> 13:30.853
Something isn't right.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.464
Yeah, it's... it's you.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.857
Now go.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.338
Go!

13:37.381 --> 13:41.342
Even when I don't want
your help, you won't help.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.213
ABETEMARCO:
You're kidding me.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.041
This is great news.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.260
Anthony.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.740
Steak dinner on me.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.873
You name the time
and the place...

13:50.917 --> 13:52.701
What the hell are you doing?

13:52.744 --> 13:55.138
That's the exact question
I want to ask you.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.705
What are you talking about?

13:56.748 --> 13:58.881
Why am I getting e-mails asking
when we're presenting

13:58.925 --> 14:01.449
the Costello robbery case
to the grand jury?

14:01.492 --> 14:04.147
Yeah, yeah, look, uh,
it's good news.I specifically said

14:04.191 --> 14:06.976
we were offering a misdemeanor
on that case.

14:07.020 --> 14:07.890
Yeah, but something's come up.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.152
It's a much better case now.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.241
Oh, is that right?A hundred percent.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.983
Interesting. Because when I look
around this office, I don't see

14:14.027 --> 14:15.071
a law degree anywhere.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.594
Wow.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.988
Now you're gonna
play like that, huh?

14:19.032 --> 14:21.208
Yeah, I'm gonna play
any way I want, Anthony.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.993
Careful Erin.No, you be careful.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.038
Now drop it.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.039
What?

14:26.082 --> 14:27.040
You heard me.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.824
I can't do that.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.656
Yes, this is A.D.A. Reagan.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.223
You did not just do...

14:36.266 --> 14:38.442
There was a gun, Erin.What gun?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.009
Uh, t-the perp stuck a-a nine

14:40.053 --> 14:42.185
right in old lady
Costello's ribs.

14:42.229 --> 14:45.362
There is no mention of a gun
on that police report, Anthony.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.755
There was a mix-up
with the paperwork,

14:46.798 --> 14:48.713
we got it sorted out.
We also got the gun.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.759
We could put this punk away
on a B felony.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.764
Why didn't you tell me that?

14:55.807 --> 14:56.896
I've been trying...No, you haven't.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.027
Not hard enough.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.595
I'm sorry.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.379
I want that paperwork
on my desk now.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.121
Every "I" better be dotted,
every "T" better be crossed.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.167
Yes, ma'am.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.049
Baez.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.964
You know, your
hunch sucks, Reagan.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.750
There is nothing unusual with
Richard Hayes's credit cards,

15:25.794 --> 15:28.275
nothing unusual on
his social media.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.580
Nothing, nada.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.539
Yeah, but there's
something there.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.063
What makes you so sure there's
something going on with him?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.065
I just know it.
Something doesn't feel right.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.415
Well, everything in the evidence
says it feels great.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.895
You're wrong, Reagan.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.505
No, I'm not wrong
this time, Baez.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.985
I know it's tough
to swallow,

15:43.029 --> 15:46.119
but even the great Danny Reagan
can be wrong sometimes.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.511
Yes.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.600
I canbe wrong,
on that rare occasion.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.907
However, this isn't that time.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.129
Phone records,
credit cards, bank records,

15:56.172 --> 15:58.653
social media, employee file.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.656
Every single one of them
checks out squeaky clean.

16:01.699 --> 16:04.398
Every single one
except this one.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.226
What the hell is that?

16:06.269 --> 16:08.489
I followed the heartbroken
husband Richard Hayes,

16:08.532 --> 16:11.840
right into the loving and
waiting arms of his girlfriend.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.581
Who is she?I don't know.

16:13.624 --> 16:14.930
Well, does she have a name?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.062
Don't know
that, either.

16:16.105 --> 16:19.979
But I suspect Mrs. Hayes might.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.723
And now I am going
to hand it off to Garrett.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.725
What else you got? I'm starving.

16:27.769 --> 16:28.944
GARRETT:
Last item.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.380
I spoke to Istanbul.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.992
You did?And I told them

16:33.035 --> 16:34.994
you were very excited
to meet with Chief Nadir

16:35.037 --> 16:36.169
during your swing through.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.779
You agreed to a sit

16:37.822 --> 16:39.172
And that top on your list

16:39.215 --> 16:41.391
was visiting their
jails, with retinue

16:41.435 --> 16:43.176
and press in tow,

16:43.219 --> 16:44.916
to show the world
just how much

16:44.960 --> 16:46.875
they'd improved on human rights.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.442
And the upshot was?

16:48.485 --> 16:49.486
They'd get back to us.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.966
BAKER:
As in, don't hold your breath?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.533
Even in translation.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.230
That's very good.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.145
I don't think I could've
winged it any better.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.452
You were gonna wing it?

16:58.495 --> 16:59.714
Yeah.GORMLEY:
Oh, yeah.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.498
He was all set to
when the, uh...

17:04.110 --> 17:05.415
When the what?

17:05.459 --> 17:08.027
Nothing. It was nothing.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.289
It doesn't sound like nothing.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.204
Something came up.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.988
So it was something.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.077
Uh...

17:15.121 --> 17:16.861
Shrugs

17:16.905 --> 17:18.472
It was just an exercise.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.908
Like, a fire drill.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.344
Like a fire drill,
or a fire drill?

17:21.388 --> 17:23.868
Like.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.003
Is that why none of you
were here when I came by?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.874
Yeah, probably.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.441
So where'd you guys go?

17:31.485 --> 17:34.531
Police business.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.967
Police?

17:36.011 --> 17:37.665
Yes.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.058
And what kind
of business am I in?

17:39.101 --> 17:40.494
Mattresses and bedding?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.844
That's all I can
tell you right now.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.672
Copy that.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.851
I'm starving.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.679
I'm not.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.072
Excuse me.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.173
This is the first time

18:07.216 --> 18:09.044
getting to eat breakfast
together in a long time.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.480
Dinner.Right, forgot.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.135
And thank you for meeting me
before going to sleep.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.138
Any idea how much longer
you'll be working midnights?

18:16.182 --> 18:17.922
Till the bad guys start
keeping banker hours.

18:20.577 --> 18:24.538
So, Winston and Morales came by
the 12th yesterday

18:24.581 --> 18:26.931
to pick up
the rest of their stuff.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.585
MmThey said the 2-9

18:28.629 --> 18:30.587
is pretty hardcore.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.415
Yeah, busiest house in the city.
They knew that coming in.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.764
Well, yeah, but I think

18:33.808 --> 18:35.766
they were a little surprised,
you know?

18:35.810 --> 18:37.942
The attitude of some
of the cops there?

18:37.986 --> 18:39.466
Oh, they'll get their sea legs.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.555
You know, it takes a while
to get used to a new place.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.774
It's even tougher
for a new place

18:43.818 --> 18:46.299
to adjust to a new boss, I bet.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.866
Is there something
on your mind, Eddie?

18:48.910 --> 18:51.042
No.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.135
Can you say that again?

18:56.178 --> 18:57.788
I swear, it's like dating
a human lie detector.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.400
Worse. You're engaged
to a human lie detector.It is not funny.

19:00.443 --> 19:01.792
Why don't you just tell me
what's really on your mind?

19:01.836 --> 19:04.360
It's nothing.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.623
That's why you're so reluctant
to discuss it?

19:06.667 --> 19:09.409
Okay, fine. The other day
I came by to see you

19:09.452 --> 19:11.062
and there were some cops
hanging out front,

19:11.106 --> 19:14.457
and they were talking
smack about you.

19:14.501 --> 19:18.722
What are their names
and shield numbers?

19:18.766 --> 19:21.551
I don't know, but if I saw them,
I could pick them out.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.597
I'm kidding.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.774
Oh. Oh.I'm kidding.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.471
Eddie, of all the years
that we rode together,

19:28.515 --> 19:30.386
did you and I ever bitch
about our sergeant?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.432
Well, yeah, but
that's different.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.260
Everyone hates their boss.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.393
And I'm a boss now, something
you got to get used to.

19:43.051 --> 19:46.402
But I-I don't understand
why he's not here,

19:46.446 --> 19:48.752
'cause you told-- why
isn't he here with you?

19:48.796 --> 19:50.319
'Cause you said
that he missed me.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.191
Yeah.
He told you that...

19:52.234 --> 19:53.366
he told you that he forgives me.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.584
Yes.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.195
I'm sure he's gonna
visit you soon.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.500
But in the meantime,

19:57.544 --> 19:59.546
we need you to help us
with something, okay?

19:59.589 --> 20:01.025
He does this, he does this.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.505
You know, he, he'll
s-say one thing,

20:02.549 --> 20:05.029
and then he does the other,

20:05.073 --> 20:07.467
and I'm somehow the crazy one.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.730
Clara, we want
to show you something.

20:09.773 --> 20:10.687
Like, he'll-he'll
tell me

20:10.731 --> 20:12.776
to do something,
and I'll do it.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.997
I'll do it, and then he'll
tell me that I didn't do it.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.564
Okay, Clara...Or I'll talk to someone,

20:17.607 --> 20:18.695
Clara.and I'll tell him something,
and then he'll insist

20:18.739 --> 20:21.742
that I never told him,
and I did, I did.

20:21.785 --> 20:22.830
Clara.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.615
I need you to focus in
right now. Okay?

20:25.659 --> 20:27.574
:
Yeah.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.793
Can you do that?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.491
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.970
What is it?

20:33.014 --> 20:34.842
Do you know this woman?

20:34.885 --> 20:37.018
Um...

20:37.061 --> 20:39.890
Yes. This is Dr. McCabe.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.283
Dr. McCabe. Okay.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.720
Does your husband know
Dr. McCabe, also?

20:43.764 --> 20:47.898
Uh, we both do.
She's our couples therapist.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.292
Couples...

20:50.336 --> 20:51.859
therapist.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.904
Okay.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.176
What are you doing?

21:05.220 --> 21:06.700
Dr. McCabe's building
is over here.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.311
You'll see.What are you doing
in the street?

21:09.355 --> 21:10.617
I'm looking for this.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.488
Right here.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.708
"Police,
please don't ticket."

21:14.751 --> 21:17.537
Every doorman in the city
makes this play.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.581
Okay, but why?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.366
Excuse me. Officer.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.324
I'm right here.DANNY: Yeah,
it's Detective.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.500
And the sign says
no standing any time.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.110
I know, Detective,
and I'm sorry.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.677
Mm-hmm.
The next garage
is six blocks away

21:27.721 --> 21:29.070
and a hundred dollars a day.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.550
Yeah, well, that's
not our problem.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.942
Call for a tow, please?Oh, no.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.988
No, no, please.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.598
Tell you what,
we help you, you help us.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.948
Okay. Do you know this woman,

21:37.992 --> 21:40.299
Dr. McCabe?Yeah, I know her.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.517
That's Camille McCabe, 3C.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.302
But doctor? She ain't no doctor.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.173
She doesn't run
a couples therapy business

21:45.216 --> 21:46.479
out of her apartment?

21:46.522 --> 21:47.958
I don't know what you're talking
about with that.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.526
She's a professor, or something.
No couples therapist.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.919
Mm-hmm.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.359
Have a good day.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.752
ABETEMARCO:
All right, all right.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.580
It's very nice of you guys,
but it was no big deal.

22:00.623 --> 22:01.842
No, it was good work, Anthony.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.539
Thank you very much.
I really appreciate it.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.414
I'll see you guys in a bit, huh?

22:08.457 --> 22:10.329
MAN:
Great work, Anthony.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.206
Hey, uh, I just wanted
to let you know

22:18.249 --> 22:20.904
we got an indictment on
the Costello robbery case.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.428
Do you really think
there's anything

22:22.471 --> 22:25.126
that happens in this office
that you know about before me?

22:25.169 --> 22:28.347
Right, of course, uh,
I just wanted to say thanks.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.958
No, what you were here hoping
was that I would say thanks,

22:31.001 --> 22:32.220
which is not
gonna happen,

22:32.263 --> 22:34.440
so you can be on your merry way.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.877
I don't get it.
We got a good indictment.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.487
What are you so pissed about?

22:38.531 --> 22:40.750
You made me look like an idiot
in front of everyone.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.405
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
you did that all on your own.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.667
You are already
in the doghouse.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.582
You really want
to end up in the pound?

22:46.626 --> 22:49.455
Look, y-you came
into my office a-all hot,

22:49.498 --> 22:51.587
hanging up on people,
screaming and yelling.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.502
You disobeyed a direct order.

22:53.546 --> 22:56.113
I didn't disobey, I just came
upon new information.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.593
And then you proceeded
to move on it

22:57.637 --> 22:59.595
without clearing it
with me or this office.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.118
You don't get to do that.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.294
Things were moving
a hundred miles an hour.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.861
I didn't have time.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.472
I honestly didn't
even think about it.

23:06.515 --> 23:07.951
Well, maybe you should have.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.693
Come on, Erin, you and I have
done this kind of thing

23:10.737 --> 23:13.087
a thousand times together.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.523
It's different now.

23:14.567 --> 23:15.481
Well, why?

23:15.524 --> 23:17.613
'Cause you're the boss?Yeah.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.659
That's right.

23:25.491 --> 23:29.843
You let me make an ass of myself
in front of the entire staff.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.975
You wouldn't let me
get a word in.

23:32.019 --> 23:33.629
And-and,

23:33.673 --> 23:36.371
to be honest, I didn't even
see them all there.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.069
Anthony, you have
to work with them.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.028
I need to lead them.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.856
I can't do that

23:42.899 --> 23:46.120
without their respect,
which I lost, thanks to you.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.828
Still don't understand
how you got the college

23:58.872 --> 24:00.743
to just give you her computer.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.005
My chiseled good looks.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.445
My powers of
hypnotic persuasion.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.927
Okay. When I told the dean
that Camille McCabe

24:10.971 --> 24:13.408
was the subject
of a police investigation,

24:13.452 --> 24:15.192
he said the computer
didn't belong to her,

24:15.236 --> 24:16.585
it belonged to
the state of New York.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.195
So he gave it to me.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.675
I guess the dean doesn't
want to run afoul

24:19.719 --> 24:21.460
of that sweet state funding.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.463
Sounds right to me.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.029
Anything yet?

24:26.073 --> 24:30.599
No real red flags, but...
well, this is a little weird.

24:30.643 --> 24:31.905
What is?

24:31.948 --> 24:34.168
You ever see that
old movie Gaslight?

24:34.211 --> 24:36.431
Gas--no.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.824
Well, she has.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.652
Quite a bit, it seems.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.654
You see all these websites?DANNY:
Mm-hmm.

24:41.697 --> 24:42.959
Each of them is either

24:43.003 --> 24:45.745
a message board about
the movie or a fan blog.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.529
Some of them are even
psychiatric papers

24:47.573 --> 24:49.400
written about the dynamic.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.054
Okay, well, what the hell is it?

24:51.098 --> 24:52.491
Well, in the movie,

24:52.534 --> 24:54.623
the husband basically drives
the wife insane.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.451
It's like psychological warfare.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.235
And over time, he
slowly convinces her

24:58.279 --> 25:02.283
that everything she thinks
is wrong or her imagination.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.850
That's what you think this is,

25:03.893 --> 25:06.809
with the Hayes couple,
uh, gaslighting?

25:06.853 --> 25:08.550
Well, it sounds a lot like
what she was saying to us

25:08.594 --> 25:09.769
the other day, right?

25:09.812 --> 25:11.553
It sounds like nonsense.Come on.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.208
Listen to my hunch.
I went with yours.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.994
What?

25:18.038 --> 25:21.041
I think both our hunches
might be right.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.180
You realize this
isn't Augusta, right?

25:35.664 --> 25:36.752
Okay!

25:38.319 --> 25:40.451
That was amazing.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.105
How'd you do that?

25:42.149 --> 25:43.629
Do what?

25:45.108 --> 25:47.241
So you want to tell me
why we're back here?

25:47.284 --> 25:49.286
Why are you always
so suspicious?

25:49.330 --> 25:51.288
Occupational hazard.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.942
I just thought it'd be fun.

25:52.986 --> 25:57.730
So the fact that I proposed to
you here is just a coincidence?

26:01.385 --> 26:03.779
I want to transfer to the 2-9.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.434
What?

26:07.435 --> 26:08.567
Absolutely not.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.438
But it was your idea.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.961
Was, and then
you turned it down.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.050
Well, I'm turning it up.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.444
The answer is no.
Why?

26:16.487 --> 26:19.360
Because you think the cops
at the 2-9 don't like me,

26:19.403 --> 26:20.753
you think I have
a public relations problem

26:20.796 --> 26:23.712
and you want to come over
and be my personal DCPI.

26:23.756 --> 26:24.626
That is not true.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.893
Okay, fine, it's a little true.

26:30.937 --> 26:34.114
It started out that way, but
that's not the real reason why.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.726
What are you...

26:37.770 --> 26:40.294
Fine.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.733
Fine. Here's the real reason.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.867
Our vows.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.477
Yeah. I don't want them
to just mean something

26:49.520 --> 26:50.609
on our wedding day.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.393
I want them
to mean something today

26:52.436 --> 26:55.483
and tomorrow
and every day after that.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.398
I will always have your back.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.400
If you fall behind,
I'll wait up.

26:59.443 --> 27:02.795
I'll earn your respect, and pay
you respect, every day we have.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.667
I'll be your scout, your night
watchman, your cavalry.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.757
Your medic, your chaplain
in our army of two.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.846
No retreat. No surrender.No surrender.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.763
You can count on me.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.765
You can count on me.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.693
And your two cents?

27:31.737 --> 27:34.522
Oh, totally your call.

27:34.565 --> 27:38.308
I know that,
but I am asking for your input.

27:38.352 --> 27:41.355
Whatever you think is best.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.966
Yes, and the way
I make that determination

27:44.010 --> 27:46.621
is a process that includes me

27:46.665 --> 27:49.363
soliciting your opinion.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.147
Why would my opinion matter?
It's police business.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.498
And there it is.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.804
Now, when you're
right, you're right.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.806
And you're right,
I am not a cop.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.721
Oh, cut it out.I am confident that I could
advise you on certain matters

27:59.765 --> 28:01.854
It's an office, not a sandbox.that pertain to
police business,

28:01.897 --> 28:04.595
caused by the hidebound
big blue wall

28:04.639 --> 28:06.641
that police business
is conducted behind...

28:06.685 --> 28:09.470
Garrett, please cut it out....the jams that lack

28:09.513 --> 28:11.777
of transparency causes,
but I am not a cop,

28:11.820 --> 28:14.127
so I recuse
myself on matters

28:14.170 --> 28:16.172
requiring that expertise.

28:30.839 --> 28:34.625
Okay. We'll do it the hard way.

28:37.977 --> 28:40.240
Dr. McCabe?

28:40.283 --> 28:41.763
Dr. McCabe.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.547
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

28:43.591 --> 28:44.548
Yes?

28:44.592 --> 28:45.767
You are Dr. McCabe, right?

28:45.811 --> 28:47.551
Camille McCabe, PhD.

28:47.595 --> 28:48.857
Mm. So not

28:48.901 --> 28:52.339
Dr. Camille McCabe,
couples therapist, right?

28:52.382 --> 28:54.602
Can I help you detectives
with something?

28:54.645 --> 28:55.777
Yeah, actually,
you can.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.300
How long have
you known Richard Hayes?

28:57.344 --> 28:58.649
Who?

28:58.693 --> 29:00.086
DANNY: The guy with
his tongue down your throat.

29:01.435 --> 29:02.392
CAMILLE:
I don't know.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.177
Uh, a year?

29:04.220 --> 29:06.527
And how long have you
and Richard Hayes

29:06.570 --> 29:08.529
been gaslighting Mrs. Hayes?

29:08.572 --> 29:09.748
E

29:11.227 --> 29:12.838
We had been seeing each other

29:12.881 --> 29:14.753
for about a year
when we first discussed it.

29:14.796 --> 29:18.408
Discuss your plan to gaslight
Richard's wife Clara.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.064
Richard tried

29:22.108 --> 29:24.240
to leave her many times.
She would simply refuse.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.461
And that's why you decided
to drive her mad?

29:27.504 --> 29:30.812
It doesn't make you insane,
it just confuses you.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.509
Whose idea was it?

29:32.553 --> 29:34.381
I was doing
some research on the topic

29:34.424 --> 29:36.775
for one of my lectures,
and it caught Richard's eye.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.646
He asked me to
drill down on it.

29:38.689 --> 29:39.821
And you did.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.518
DANNY: And when
that didn't work,

29:41.562 --> 29:44.521
you decided to double down,
and take on the role

29:44.565 --> 29:47.568
of a phony couples therapist
for Richard and Clara?

29:47.611 --> 29:48.874
Richard insisted
she was close to breaking.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.659
He just thought she needed
a little nudge.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.661
"Nudge" being drugging her
with chloroform

29:53.704 --> 29:55.794
and staging an attempted murder.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.186
Hey, that was all Richard.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.753
I had nothing to do with that.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.147
When I found out the reason
that Richard wanted me

30:01.190 --> 30:02.496
to research the effects
of chloroform,

30:02.539 --> 30:04.019
I told him he was crazy.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.065
I said I wanted nothing
to do with it.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.458
But you didn't call the police.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.591
No.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.506
But I should have.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.725
I absolutely should have.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.858
Would you be willing
to testify in court

30:16.902 --> 30:18.164
to all of this?

30:19.556 --> 30:22.603
Absolutely.
A hundred percent.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.520
Richard should pay
for what he did.

30:39.794 --> 30:40.664
CAMILLE :
Absolutely.

30:40.708 --> 30:43.363
A hundred percent.

30:43.406 --> 30:44.843
Richard should pay
for what he did.

30:48.194 --> 30:51.414
This is garbage.
Complete and utter nonsense.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.633
This was all her idea.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.504
He said, she said.DANNY:
Yep.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.158
And she said first,
so guess what?

30:56.202 --> 30:57.507
She's the grand
prize winner.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.118
Well, she's lying.
Mm.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.771
It was her idea
to fake the shooting.

31:00.815 --> 31:01.685
Her idea to
make it look like

31:01.729 --> 31:04.601
Clara shot me.I'm sure it was.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.647
I'm not lying.
This was all her plan.

31:07.691 --> 31:08.649
She was there, too.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.695
Say again.It's true.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.481
She was in the kitchen,
hiding.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.657
She's the one that slipped
chloroform into her drink.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.571
Hell, she's the one
who actually shot me

31:17.614 --> 31:19.051
after Clara passed out.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.401
Sounds like you're throwing
a little bit of a Hail Mary,

31:21.444 --> 31:22.619
don't you think, Richard?

31:22.663 --> 31:23.794
It's the God's honest truth.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.622
He said, she said.
Yeah.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.668
Only matters what
you can prove. Come on.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.670
Come on, get up.Wait, wait, wait.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.151
I can prove it.
I can.

31:32.194 --> 31:33.717
How you gonna
do that, Richard?

31:33.761 --> 31:36.720
You gonna gaslight us, too?No, no, no.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.679
I've got a nanny cam
in the living room.

31:38.722 --> 31:41.160
I put it there to keep an eye
on Clara when I wasn't home.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.249
Camille didn't know
about it, but...

31:43.292 --> 31:45.686
it had to have
recorded everything.

31:45.729 --> 31:46.905
The shooting will be on there.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.907
Hmm. Right.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.970
Oh...
RICHARD:
See?

32:09.014 --> 32:10.711
Told ya.

32:17.196 --> 32:21.678
Well, you guys are crazy,
but this is good news.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.767
Yeah?Yeah.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.683
Does this get me off?It gets your wife off.

32:26.727 --> 32:27.902
And puts you
and your girlfriend away

32:27.946 --> 32:28.990
for a very long time.

32:29.034 --> 32:31.514
Come on, get up.
Get up!

33:05.766 --> 33:07.028
Officers, fall in
for roll call.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.687
Officer Cooper.Here, sir.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.298
2-9 Frank. Don't forget
to fill up this time.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.039
Officer Tedesco.Here.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.127
Patrol post 15.

33:19.171 --> 33:22.130
Officer Janko.Present, sir.

33:22.174 --> 33:23.349
Patrol post 11.

33:23.392 --> 33:24.437
Yes, sir.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.656
And welcome to the 2-9.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.876
Officer Goldman...Yes, sir.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.921
Patrol post 9...

33:47.808 --> 33:51.812
Hey, Erin, I'm so sorry.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.074
No, it's me.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.076
It's just, it's this job.
I should have...

33:55.120 --> 33:57.209
Nonsense. I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.080
And I should have listened.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.125
What do you say
we bury the hatchet

34:00.168 --> 34:01.430
in a couple of martinis?

34:01.474 --> 34:04.607
Straight up with a twist?Let's do it.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.834
[mellow piano music playing,
indistinct chatter]

34:19.187 --> 34:20.841
Good night.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.886
WOMAN:
Bye.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.591
Deputy Commissioner Moore,
come with us, please.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.071
What the hell?!

34:33.114 --> 34:35.986
Just come with us, sir.
It's okay.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.988
Come with us, right now,
let's go.

35:01.316 --> 35:04.798
12 minutes and four seconds
from pickup.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.148
Well done.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.671
That'll be all,
Inspector,

35:08.715 --> 35:09.716
and thank you.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.069
Where am I?

35:15.113 --> 35:18.072
Bravo Bunker.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.729
This place was created
in the wake of 911.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.470
Why am I here?

35:24.513 --> 35:26.820
We've been asking ourselves
the same thing.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.517
Yeah, boss.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.606
I am getting to that.

35:32.260 --> 35:36.177
Look, I was assuming
that all three of you

35:36.221 --> 35:40.790
would be in my office
at the same time.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.969
You were delayed, so you were
deleted from the drill.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.884
Yeah, I felt pretty deleted.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.713
I-- You made that very clear.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.717
But there wasn't an option.

35:54.761 --> 35:58.547
No one talks of this place
outside of this place.

36:00.549 --> 36:04.292
This facility was designed
for only the most

36:04.336 --> 36:08.209
indispensable men and women
of the NYPD.

36:12.909 --> 36:16.870
I have come to realize
that title and rank

36:16.913 --> 36:21.570
are not the only things
that go into "indispensable."

36:23.442 --> 36:25.139
You are.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.710
You are.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.944
You are.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.699
I will now show you your bunks

37:03.743 --> 37:06.572
and the kitchen

37:06.615 --> 37:08.791
while you say a prayer

37:08.835 --> 37:11.403
that we never have
to use them.

37:11.446 --> 37:12.621
EDDIE:
In the name of the Father,

37:12.665 --> 37:14.406
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

37:14.449 --> 37:18.192
Our Father, full of grace
who arts in heaven,

37:18.236 --> 37:21.456
forgive us our daily bread,
and blessed is the fruit

37:21.500 --> 37:23.719
of those who trespass
against us...

37:23.763 --> 37:24.851
HENRY:
Okay, Eddie, Eddie,

37:24.894 --> 37:26.896
I have to stop you there.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.811
Seriously, what was that?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.335
I was saying grace.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.640
I have no idea what
you were just saying.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.294
Yeah, but it definitely
wasn't grace.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.600
JAMIE:
It's okay, babe,

37:34.643 --> 37:36.079
I think you just got
a little confused.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.038
I think you were saying
the Our Father...

37:38.081 --> 37:39.648
With a little Hail Mary
thrown in there.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.302
And then she circled back
to the Our Father again.Right...

37:41.346 --> 37:45.088
SEAN: And then it was just kind
of like a super weird mash-up.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.351
It made no sense.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.266
It's okay, babe.
They're just busting chops.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.268
Yeah, it's-- I just--
I was just, I don't know,

37:50.311 --> 37:52.966
I was just trying
to fit in. I...

37:53.009 --> 37:55.795
I don't know why you guys
have to all be so mean.

37:55.838 --> 37:56.883
Eddie, they were--

37:56.926 --> 37:58.319
You just sat there.
You let them.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.413
Really, guys?

38:05.457 --> 38:06.762
Jamie...

38:10.549 --> 38:13.856
Well... happy?

38:15.380 --> 38:17.469
Who knew she was so sensitive?

38:17.512 --> 38:19.297
Who knew we were
so insensitive?

38:19.340 --> 38:21.690
I guess we're just
used to each other.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.345
I started it.
I guess I'll go and apologize.

38:24.389 --> 38:27.435
Thanks, guys, I really
appreciate the warm welcome.

38:27.479 --> 38:28.828
What's next, noogies?

38:28.871 --> 38:29.829
She leave?No.

38:29.872 --> 38:32.353
She's just getting a grip.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.225
Eddie, I-I started it.
It was wrong.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.488
It was just wrong.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.316
Yeah, I think it was
just our family's

38:38.359 --> 38:40.840
poor attempt at humor.
We're-We're sorry, Eddie.

38:40.883 --> 38:43.321
Lame of us to go
for the easy joke.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.583
Even lamer of us

38:44.626 --> 38:46.193
to make fun of
the effort you put in.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.806
Sorry.
Sorry.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.113
Sorry.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.376
I don't know.

38:55.420 --> 39:00.207
I don't know what
to say, except...

39:00.250 --> 39:03.428
Wow, you guys are
really easy.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.647
What?
EDDIE:
What a bunch of suckers.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.127
A few crocodile tears

39:07.170 --> 39:08.476
and you're-and you're
just groveling to me.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.957
DANNY:
Oh, my God.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.265
Okay, all right,
so this is all a big joke.

39:15.309 --> 39:16.397
Payback is a bitch.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.312
Oh, so you were
in on it?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.618
Well, after last week's
initiation,

39:19.661 --> 39:20.706
I told him I wanted
to give you guys

39:20.749 --> 39:21.837
a taste of your own medicine.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.405
So we cooked this up together.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.798
Yeah, but our
family's tradition

39:25.841 --> 39:27.887
is to gang up
on the new spouse.That's right.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.367
Not the other way around.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.806
Well, now we got
a new family tradition.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.503
Well done.

39:35.547 --> 39:36.765
Bravo.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.550
Well played.You did good.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.552
Pass the potatoes.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.076
Thank you.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.556
It was just so funny.
