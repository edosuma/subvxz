00:56.820 --> 00:58.412

05:24.020 --> 05:26.682
WHAT DO EXPERIENCED OFFICERS

05:26.720 --> 05:28.051
GOOD ONES
GO OVER THEIR NOTES.

05:28.090 --> 05:30.581
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING...

05:30.630 --> 05:32.029

05:51.010 --> 05:52.944
I DON'T KNOW, OBNOXIOUS.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.039
AND SOME MIGHT ALSO SAY
THAT IGNORING SOMEBODY'S CALLS

05:55.080 --> 05:56.684
IS KIND OF OBNOXIOUS, TOO.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.517
LOOK, STEVE...

05:58.550 --> 06:02.384
I-I'M NOT LOOKING

OF THAT, BROTHER?

07:38.290 --> 07:41.054
YOU... ME, SAM.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.728
IT'LL BE LIKE
A BEER COMMERCIAL,

07:42.760 --> 07:45.024
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU
ARE GONNA BRING THE BEER.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.823
I CAN'T.
I GOT AN EARLY START TOMORROW.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.122
WE'RE IN. HOW MUCH BEER?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.525
(Oliver) NICE!
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN CARRY.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.720
WE'RE LEAVING IN TEN MINUTES.
TEN MINUTES!

07:51.770 --> 07:53.032
(door closes)

07:54.570 --> 07:55.992
YOU SEE?
WHAT?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.860
WE'RE IN. WE'RE MEN.
(door opens)

07:57.910 --> 07:59.161
WE'RE GOING TO A CABIN.

07:59.210 --> 08:01.132
(thud)

08:01.180 --> 08:02.875
(indistinct conversations)

08:02.910 --> 08:04.571
(door buzzes in distance)

08:04.610 --> 08:06.100
HEY.
HEY.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.243
(sets cup down)

08:08.280 --> 08:10.145
(refrigerator door opens)

08:12.020 --> 08:14.159
OH. (chuckles)
LOOK AT THAT.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.851
YOU TAKE CREAM
IN YOUR TEA, TOO.

08:15.890 --> 08:17.084
THAT'S FUNNY.
(chuckles) YEAH.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.882
THAT'S ACTUALLY HYSTERICAL.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.795
WELL, I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE
WILL TAKE IT WITH MILK

08:20.830 --> 08:22.525
OR JUST BLACK.
(pouring tea)

08:22.570 --> 08:24.219
CAN YOU SAY THAT TEA IS BLACK,
OR IS THAT JUST COFFEE?

08:24.270 --> 08:26.226
HEY. WHY ARE YOU
SO TWITCHY?

08:26.270 --> 08:28.591
I'M NOT. I'M NOT.
I'M JUST, UH...

08:28.640 --> 08:30.107
I'M REALLY HAPPY
THAT WE'RE FRIENDS.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.732
YOU KNOW, OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT WE ARE,

08:31.770 --> 08:34.102
AND I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO
ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE THAT.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.131
AND--AND IF I DID DO SOMETHING
TO JEOPARDIZE THAT,

08:36.180 --> 08:37.738
THEN I WOULD WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.145
OKAY, THEN LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT.

08:39.180 --> 08:40.272
OKAY.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.844
GOOD. GOOD.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.586
LINES OF COMMUNICATION
ARE... OPEN.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.985
(inhales)

08:45.020 --> 08:46.715
HERE GOES.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.593
(stammers)

08:52.630 --> 08:54.951
THIS ISN'T REALLY
HOW I COMMUNICATE.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.194
RIGHT.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.294
WOW. OKAY, SO I DID THAT.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.835
BUT THAT WAS LONG OVERDUE.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.337
(radio chatter)

09:03.370 --> 09:06.828
AND NOW I HAVE TO GO.
(alert beeps, woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

09:06.880 --> 09:08.131
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.000
YOU TELL ME.

YEAH--

09:10.050 --> 09:12.575
OH. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SOMETHING TELLS ME PEOPLE ARE

09:12.620 --> 09:14.611
BEING ASKED TO STAY LATE.
YEP, BUT NOT US.

09:14.650 --> 09:15.878
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT BOOKING,
ALL RIGHT?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.342
YEAH.
STEP LIGHTLY.
COME ON, BOYS.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.018
(radio chatter,
telephone ringing)

09:20.060 --> 09:21.186
(Oliver) SAM!

09:21.220 --> 09:23.085
YOU'RE KILLING ME, MAN!

09:23.130 --> 09:24.688
(woman) HALF OF
THE ONCOMING SHIFT

09:24.730 --> 09:26.027
IS OUT WITH FOOD POISONING.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.199
WHO BUSTED THE GROW-OP
ON EUCLID?

09:28.230 --> 09:29.663
OH, I DID, STAFF.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.122
WELL, IT'S A BIG JOB,
AND WE COULD USE

09:31.170 --> 09:33.035
SOME EXTRA UNIFORMS
TO HELP OUT.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.129
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE ON THE GO.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.001
GREAT.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.268
(radio chatter)

09:39.310 --> 09:40.868
I DON'T KNOW,
MIGHT BE NICE

09:40.910 --> 09:42.969
TO WORK WITH SOME
NEW PEOPLE, RIGHT?

09:43.010 --> 09:44.875
SURE.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.741
(radio chatter continues)

09:46.780 --> 09:48.941
(door creaks)

09:50.090 --> 09:51.739
(radio chatter)
WHOA.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.054
(camera shutter clicking)

09:54.090 --> 09:56.081
TRACE? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

09:56.120 --> 09:57.929
I AM THE DETECTIVE ON THIS.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.825
I'M OVERSEEING
THE INVESTIGATION.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.088
OH.

10:01.130 --> 10:02.893
OKAY, SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HERE,

10:02.930 --> 10:04.397
BESIDES WASTING
OUR PRECIOUS TIME?

10:04.430 --> 10:06.739
FORENSICS CAN'T REALLY
GO OVER THE SCENE

10:06.770 --> 10:08.863
UNTIL ALL THE PLANTS
HAVE BEEN CLEARED.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.162
CLEARED?

10:10.210 --> 10:13.134
WE WERE BROUGHT HERE
TO CLEAR PLANTS?

10:13.180 --> 10:16.001
GAIL, MANY PEOPLE FIND
GARDENING THERAPEUTIC.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.974
(Nick) SUIT UP, LADIES.

10:18.010 --> 10:18.942
THAN KS.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.949
(radio chatter,
shutter clicking continues)

10:21.980 --> 10:23.288
HEY, IS THERE SOMETHING
ELSE I CAN DO?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.641
PAPERWORK? ANYTHING?

10:25.690 --> 10:27.009
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.755
SOMETHING'S UP WITH YOU
AND GAIL. WHAT IS IT?

10:28.790 --> 10:30.849
NO. WE'RE GOOD.

10:30.890 --> 10:31.959
WE'RE GREAT.

10:31.990 --> 10:35.118
HEY, NASH.
YOU FLYING SOLO ON THIS?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.866
YEP. IT'S A GROW-OP.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.027
SO TONS OF FILING,
CHAIN OF CUSTODY.

10:39.070 --> 10:40.697
I CAN HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.164
WELL, MAYBE IT JUST GOT
A LITTLE MORE GLAMOROUS.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.269
(man) FOUND HIM IN THE CONTAINER
BY THE PLANTS.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.375
HELL OF A DAY TO BE
FLYING SOLO.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.086
(Young Rival) * SHE'S BEEN
TO JAIL TWO TIMES BEFORE *

11:03.130 --> 11:05.325
* HER FATHER WAS A COP

11:05.360 --> 11:07.794
ALL RIGHT, LOAD UP, MEN,
WE'RE HERE!

11:07.830 --> 11:09.866
BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH, MAN.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.765
NOT SO FAR FROM THE CITY,
BUT...

11:11.800 --> 11:14.064
HERE YOU GO.
FEELS LIKE
A MILLION MILES AWAY.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.091
GRAB WHATEVER YOU CAN.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.209
**

11:17.240 --> 11:19.162
(whirrin
OHHIQ)

11:19.210 --> 11:21.804
* SHE SAYS, "IS IT TRUE?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.444
* YOU AND ME ARE THROUGH?"

11:23.480 --> 11:25.300
TAKE A _DEEP BREATH.
(Inhales)

11:25.350 --> 11:28.319
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT SMELL IS?
EXHAUST FUMES?

11:28.350 --> 11:29.749
(mocking laugh)

11:29.790 --> 11:32.315
THAT IS FREEDOM.
(keys jangle)

11:33.920 --> 11:36.309
ENJOY IT. (inhales)

11:36.360 --> 11:38.783
(cell phone chirps)
NO, NO, NO!

11:38.830 --> 11:41.025
HEY. NO PHONES. NOT TODAY.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.766

11:44.030 --> 11:46.760
THANK YOU, DOV.
YOURS, TOO, DIAZ.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.394

11:49.440 --> 11:51.931
(cell phone rings)
OH.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.335

12:03.390 --> 12:06.018

(door closes)

12:06.050 --> 12:09.110
WE HAVE TWO BEDROOMS.
THE BATHROOM IS OVER THERE.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.025
WE ARE, UH, STANDING
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

12:11.060 --> 12:12.755
AS I OVERSTATE THE OBVIOUS.
(door opens)

12:12.800 --> 12:14.449
AH. DIAZ, FEEL FREE.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.764
HELP YOURSELF TO ANYTHING THAT'S
IN THE, UM, IN THE FRIDGE.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.267
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE FRIDGE.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.836
OH, YEAH. RIGHT, RIGHT,

12:19.870 --> 12:21.428
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, MAN,

12:29.980 --> 12:31.277
I'LL BE IN THE MASTER SUITE.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.971
WELL, HOW COME WE AUTOMATICALLY
GET THE BUNK BEDS?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.510
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A DEMOCRACY.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.370
OH, IT IS. IT IS.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.012
FEEL FREE TO COMPLAIN
ALL YOU WANT.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.881
TOP OR BOTTOM?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.114
DON'T EVER ASK ME THAT AGAIN.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.309
(laughs)
(claps hands)

12:42.360 --> 12:43.850

12:53.840 --> 12:57.901
(switch clicking)
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

12:57.940 --> 12:59.339
WHICH ALSO MEANS NO HEAT.

12:59.370 --> 13:01.930
OKAY. THAT'S...

13:01.980 --> 13:03.277

14:07.040 --> 14:08.132
FIRST NAME?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.045
IVAN.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.105

14:12.150 --> 14:14.573
DOOR WAS OPEN, I WENT IN,
FIGURED I'D BLAZE A J-MAN,

14:14.620 --> 14:16.986

I WAS HEADING OUT WHEN
THAT OFFICER GRABBED ME

14:19.090 --> 14:21.581

14:32.300 --> 14:33.892
'CAUSE HIS BREATH WAS

14:33.940 --> 14:35.362

15:23.520 --> 15:25.647
WHICH ONE IS CHEECH?
IS HE THE SMART ONE?

15:25.690 --> 15:26.987
WAS THERE A SMART ONE?

15:27.020 --> 15:28.351
(cell phone chimes)

15:28.390 --> 15:29.618
IT WAS A JOKE.
(beep)

15:29.660 --> 15:30.752
OH, THE GROW HOUSE IS CLEAR.

15:30.790 --> 15:33.293
WHICH MEANS I CAN HEAD BACK,
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCENE.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.389
IT MIGHT HELP IF I HAD
A UNIFORM WITH ME.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.966
SOMEBODY WITH GOOD EYES,
GOOD INSTINCT.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.991
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD JOB FOR OFFICER PRICE.

15:39.030 --> 15:40.338
IT DOES?
IT DOES?

15:40.370 --> 15:41.496
I'LL HANG BACK,

15:41.540 --> 15:43.132
JUST FOLLOW UP
ON SOME OF THESE LEADS.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.400
A'IGHT. CHLOE IT IS.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.930
(clicks pen)

15:48.480 --> 15:49.538
GIGGLE STICK.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.571
GIGGLE STICK.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.475
(radio chatter)

15:53.520 --> 15:55.408
(groans)
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

15:55.450 --> 15:58.419
YEP. GIVES NEW MEANING
TO THE TERM "HOT BOX."

15:58.450 --> 16:00.452
(laughs)
ANDY?

16:00.490 --> 16:02.082
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
CAN YOU SAY IT?

16:02.120 --> 16:04.088
IF NOT, CAN YOU STOP
ACTING WEIRD?
(liquid splashes)

16:04.130 --> 16:06.325
_ WHAT THE HELL?
(Sighs) NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.725
WHAT THE HELL?
OKAY, LISTEN.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.263
GAIL, I AM SO SORRY,
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED--

16:10.300 --> 16:12.495
AAH! AH I
WHAT?!"

16:12.530 --> 16:14.532
GOD, MY WRIST IS BURNING!

16:14.570 --> 16:16.435
OH, IT'S BURNING,
IT'S BURNING.

16:16.470 --> 16:18.267
IT'S INDUSTRIAL
DRAIN CLEANER.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.108
UGH! (panting)
WHOA! OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

16:21.140 --> 16:22.334
I THINK WE NEED TO GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.747
LET'S GO.
(panï¬ng)

16:25.780 --> 16:28.214
(birds calling and chirping)

16:28.250 --> 16:29.774
YOU KNOW, IT IS
PRETTY NICE OUT HERE.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.242
GLAD WE CAME.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.258
YEAH. IT'S AWESOME.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.378
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.479
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHRIS?
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.124
I THOUGHT WE'D CROSSED OVER,
BUT... (scoffs) LOOK AT US.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.354
ERRAND BOYS.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.618
COME ON, MAN, THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.626
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE
TO GET THESE GUYS' RESPECT?

16:46.670 --> 16:49.639
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND,

16:49.670 --> 16:52.138
FIND SOME WOOD,
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.502
OKAY. WHAT ABOUT
THAT TREE RIGHT THERE?

16:54.540 --> 16:57.270
IT'S GREEN. WON'T BURN.

16:57.310 --> 16:59.471
YOU'RE TELLING ME
NONE OF THESE TREES WILL BURN?

17:01.220 --> 17:03.347
OH, MAN, THOSE TWO...
(laughs)

17:03.390 --> 17:04.709
IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.150
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
KINDA BREAKS MY HEART.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.158
ANYWAY, WHO--HOW'S THIS?

17:09.190 --> 17:10.657
THIS IS A PIECE OF CAKE.
GOOD.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.521
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE DOING IT.
(laughs)

17:12.560 --> 17:14.653
(laughs) SO, UH...
HMM...

17:14.700 --> 17:17.794
WHAT MADE YOU... BUY
THIS PLACE OUT OF NOWHERE?

17:17.830 --> 17:19.661
(breathes deeply)
CELERY HAD A, UH...

17:19.700 --> 17:22.134
CELERY HAD A-A HOUSE BLESSING
TO GO TO,

17:22.170 --> 17:24.434
SO WE WERE OUT LOOKING
FOR SPECULAR HEMATITE.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.062
BUT THE GUY--

17:26.110 --> 17:27.634
THE GUY IS TRYING TO
SELL US TUMBLED,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.568
LIKE WE DON'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.578
AND... (sighs)

17:31.610 --> 17:34.147
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
THIS IS OF NO VALUE TO YOU.

17:34.180 --> 17:36.273
UH, THE POINT IS, WE WERE
HEADING BACK TO THE CITY,

17:36.320 --> 17:38.117
AND I SPOTTED THIS JOINT,
YOU KNOW?

17:38.150 --> 17:39.708
ONE LOOK AND I KNEW
I HAD TO BUY IT.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.615
SO YOU AND THE WITCH
WENT TO BUY MAGIC CRYSTALS

17:41.660 --> 17:43.582
AND BOUGHT A HOUSE
MADE OF TWIGS INSTEAD?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.222
(laughs) YEAH.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.194
I MEAN, WE GOT THE HEMATITE,
TOO, BUT...
OH, GOOD.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.356
I DON'T KNOW.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.220
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
THAT I LOOKED AT SOMETHING

17:50.270 --> 17:51.623
AND JUST KNEW, YOU KNOW?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.297
LESS THINKING,
MORE DOING, RIGHT?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.262
YEAH. COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE, SO...

17:55.300 --> 17:57.461
(chuckles)
LET'S DO THIS.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.636
PASS ME MY BEER,
WILL YOU?

17:58.670 --> 18:00.308
YES, OF COURSE, PAL.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.228
OH.
(clink)

18:02.280 --> 18:03.645
To--
To YOUR HOUSE.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.238
(laughs)

18:05.280 --> 18:08.147
HMM. TO CELERY.
(laughs)

18:08.180 --> 18:11.115
SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN TRICKY
TO GET IVAN INTO THAT DRUM,

18:11.150 --> 18:12.686
AND WHOEVER IT WAS
CLEANED UP AFTER THEMSELVES.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.278
THERE'S NO BLOOD.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.412
(radio chatter)

18:15.460 --> 18:16.779
CAN YOU STEP BACK
A BIT?

18:16.820 --> 18:18.128
OH, YEAH. SORRY.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.128
(clattering)
CH LOE--CHLOE!

18:20.160 --> 18:22.720
LET'S TRY TO PRESERVE
THE SCENE AS MUCH AS WE CAN.
I KNOW.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.796
OKAY?
I'M S--I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.537
(sighs) ALL RIGHT,
NO REAL SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY,

18:27.570 --> 18:30.130
SO IVAN MUST HAVE KNOWN
THE GUY, LET HIM IN.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.637
AND NO SIGN OF A SCUFFLE.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.638
AND IVAN
WAS SHOT IN THE BACK,

18:33.680 --> 18:35.671
SO HE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW THAT IT WAS COMING.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.541
NOT A TRUE FRIEND.
(men speaking indistinctly)

18:37.580 --> 18:38.808
HMM?

18:38.850 --> 18:40.442
YOU KNOW, OSCAR WILDE--

18:40.480 --> 18:43.142
A TRUE FRIEND STABS YOU
IN THE FRONT, YOU KNOW?

18:43.190 --> 18:45.283
BUT IVAN WASN'T STABBED.
HE WAS SHOT.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.687
TRACI NASH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.381
GUNS AND GANGS, BABY.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.921
UH, DO YOU WANT TO
CHECK OUT THE BASEMENT?

18:52.960 --> 18:55.554
WE KNOW THE PORTUGUESE GUYS
HAVE BEEN RUNNING THIS AREA,

18:55.600 --> 18:57.522
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT
NO SMALL-TIME DEALER

18:57.570 --> 18:59.390
IS MOVING THIS MUCH PRODUCT
ON THEIR OWN.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.931
SO, ERGO, WE'RE TAKING
AN INTEREST.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.631
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

19:02.670 --> 19:04.558
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
ANSWERED.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.907
ANYWAY, THAN KS
FOR HOLDING THE FORT.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.669
MAYBE YOU GUYS--
YOU WANT TO TAKE FIVE,

19:07.710 --> 19:09.871
JUST, YOU KNOW, LET US
DO OUR THING, AND THEN--

19:09.910 --> 19:11.605
THEN I'LL BRIEF YOU, OKAY?

19:11.650 --> 19:14.175
EXCUSE ME.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.949
WAIT. THANK YOU.
YEAH.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.346
THANKS.
OKAY, SO I TALKED TO HIM.
HE SAID THAT, UH...

19:18.390 --> 19:20.813
MY FIRST SOLO HOMICIDE.
HE'S GONNA GET IN MY WAY

19:20.860 --> 19:22.680
BECAUSE I DIDN'T RETURN
HIS CALLS?

19:22.720 --> 19:25.427
(camera Shutters clicking)

19:25.460 --> 19:26.654
UNLESS...

19:26.690 --> 19:28.897
HEY, SAAB, WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE?

19:28.930 --> 19:31.660
BULLET CASING.
9-MILLIMETER.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.236
SENDING IT IN FOR PRINTS
RIGHT NOW.

19:33.270 --> 19:34.965
(bag rustling)
PRINTS?
WH-WHEN THOSE GET BACK,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.661
DO YOU MIND IF I AM
THE FIRST TO SEE THEM?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.907
AREN'T YOU SHARING THIS
WITH GUNS AND GANGS?

19:38.940 --> 19:40.407
HOW'S NADIA?

19:40.440 --> 19:41.771
SHE'S FINE.

19:41.810 --> 19:43.675
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I AM THE ONE

19:43.710 --> 19:45.701
WHO SET YOU GUYS UP,
AREN'T I?

19:45.750 --> 19:47.411
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

19:47.450 --> 19:48.815
I GUESS IT WOULDN'T HURT
IF YOU GOT THEM

19:48.850 --> 19:50.545
A LITTLE SOONER
THAN THEY DID.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.716
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE LUCKY
SHE'S CUTE.

19:57.490 --> 19:58.923
(reads in German)

19:58.960 --> 20:00.928
WHAT, UH, WHAT DO YOU
THINK THAT MEANS?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.518
(German accent) I DON'T
SPEAK THE GERMAN. (laughing)

20:02.560 --> 20:03.925
(German accent) YOU DON'T
SPEAK THE GERMAN. ALL RIGHT.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.392
(normal voice)
WHERE'S THE SOCKET WRENCH?

20:05.430 --> 20:06.590
(normal voice) I DON'T GOT
A SOCKET WRENCH, MAN.

20:06.630 --> 20:08.530
WHAT DO--WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T HAVE A SOCKET WRENCH?

20:08.570 --> 20:10.435
I DON'T KNOW. THESE WERE HERE
WHEN I GOT THE PLACE.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.835
ANYWAYS,
I RECALL YOU SAYING

20:11.870 --> 20:13.576
THIS WAS GONNA BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

20:13.610 --> 20:15.407
I-I--THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW YOU
DIDN'T HAVE A SOCKET WRENCH.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.930
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE.
JUST--WHAT ABOUT THIS?

20:16.980 --> 20:18.447
(crackling, explosion)
AAH! AAH! AAH!

20:18.480 --> 20:19.572
OHH' (lau '
. h
ow? "'9'

20:19.610 --> 20:21.646
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
IS YOUR HAND OKAY?

20:21.680 --> 20:23.545
(laughs)
DON'T LAUGH.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.387
I'M S--I APOLOGIZE.
(stammers)
DAMN IT!

20:25.420 --> 20:26.682
I DON'T--
UH, UH, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.608
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT?

20:28.660 --> 20:30.355
THANKS FOR INVITING ME,
OLIVER.

20:30.390 --> 20:31.857
I'M HAVING SUCH
A GREAT TIME, YOU KNOW?

20:31.890 --> 20:33.494
I'M REALLY--
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO YOU

20:33.530 --> 20:35.691
BECAUSE I'M NOT SITTING
AT A BLACKJACK TABLE

20:35.730 --> 20:37.027
IN A WARM CASINO RIGHT NOW.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.823
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

20:38.870 --> 20:40.531
THAT EPSTEIN AND DIAZ
HAD THE RIGHT IDEA.

20:40.570 --> 20:41.935
THEY'RE OUT THERE
HAVING A BLAST,

20:41.970 --> 20:44.530
NOT SITTING IN HERE,
NOT FIXING THIS.

20:44.570 --> 20:46.504
I'M FREEZING.
I KNOW.

20:46.540 --> 20:47.837
AND HUNGRY.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.677
HEY, WHAT ABOUT THAT?

20:49.710 --> 20:51.746
SERIOUSLY, DUDE,
THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.748
IF IT'S GREEN,
IT WON'T BURN.

20:53.780 --> 20:54.974
(birds calling)

20:55.020 --> 20:57.409
DEAD TREE--2:00.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.010
SAME PROBLEM. IT'S ROTTEN.
IT'S TOO WET.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.484
I'M STARTING TO THINK
YOU'RE MAKING THIS STUFF UP.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.885
YOU KNOW, OLIVER AND SWAREK

21:03.930 --> 21:06.285
ARE PROBABLY YUKKING IT UP
IN THE CABIN RIGHT NOW

21:06.330 --> 21:09.299
WHILE WE'RE STUCK OUT HERE
IN THIS FIRE-RETARDANT FOREST.

21:09.330 --> 21:11.525
(grunts)

21:11.570 --> 21:12.798
UH...
(groans)

21:12.830 --> 21:15.037
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.760
(groans)

21:18.810 --> 21:21.404
I ROLLED MY ANKLE.
OKAY. THIS IS STUPID.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.930
WE GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
ALL RIGHT? SWAREK AND OLIVER--

21:22.980 --> 21:24.675
THEY CAN GET THEIR OWN
DAMN WOOD.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.644
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.
HOLD ON. I'M FINE,
I'M FINE.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.942
YOU SURE? I DON'T MIND.
NO. I'M FINE.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.072
JUST TAKE MY ARM.
REALLY.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.382
I'M HERE FOR YOU.
(mutters)

21:30.420 --> 21:32.809
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.688
HEY. WE CAME
FROM THIS WAY.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.585
UH, NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
WE CAME FROM THIS WAY.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.393
NO, NO, NO.
WE CAME FROM NORTH,

21:40.430 --> 21:41.954
WHICH IS THIS WAY.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.093
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE NORTH IS,

21:44.130 --> 21:47.395
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
WE CAME FROM OVER HERE.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.698
GREAT.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.867
(sighs) NOW WE'RE LOST.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.679
COME ON.

21:56.710 --> 21:57.677
(bird cries)

21:57.710 --> 21:59.405
OKAY, SO THE NURSE SAID
THAT THE PAINKILLERS

21:59.450 --> 22:01.475
SHOULD START
TO KICK IN SOON.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.475
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU ANYTHING

22:02.520 --> 22:03.487
WHILE WE WAIT
FOR THE DOCTOR?

22:03.520 --> 22:05.385
LIKE A MAGAZINE
OR C|\OC|):FEE?

22:05.420 --> 22:06.444
I ACTUALLY THINK
I'D RATHER TALK

22:06.490 --> 22:09.015
ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA
TELL ME BACK AT THE SCENE.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.925
GELATIN? I CAN GET YOU
SOME GELATIN.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.928
NAH. I'M MORE INTERESTED

22:12.960 --> 22:15.690
IN "I'M SO SORRY
SOMETHING HAPPENED."

22:15.730 --> 22:17.823
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

22:17.870 --> 22:20.088
OKAY.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.964
(chair wheels roll)
LET'S DO THIS.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.776
(sighs) GAIL,
SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN...

22:27.810 --> 22:29.107
ANDY.
AND PEOPLE GET HURT.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.142
YOU KNOW, GOOD PEOPLE.
ANDY?

22:31.180 --> 22:32.374
ANDY.

22:32.410 --> 22:35.015
IS THAT AN ELEPHANT?

22:35.050 --> 22:36.540
EXCUSE ME?

22:39.090 --> 22:40.409
GET IT FOR ME.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.916
OKAY.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.822
(chair creaks)
(sighs)

22:50.870 --> 22:52.724
THIS IS SO LITTLE.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.835
IT'S LIKE A BABY, YOU KNOW?

22:55.870 --> 22:56.962
MM-HMM.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.706
IT'S A BABY ELEPHANT.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.436
IT'S... IT'S FREAKING ME OUT,
ACTUALLY.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.698
IT'S ACTUALLY FREAKING ME OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.445
IT'S FREAKING ME OUT,
MCNALLY.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.573
I WANT YOU TO GET IT
AWAY FROM ME--
OKAY.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.576
GONE.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

23:09.620 --> 23:12.714
HOW MUCH OXYCODONE
DID THEY GIVE YOU?

23:12.750 --> 23:15.753
A LOT.
AND I KIND OF LIKE IT.

23:15.790 --> 23:17.587
AAH. (exhales deeply)

23:17.630 --> 23:19.586
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

23:19.630 --> 23:20.949
UM...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.697
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW...
SOFT YOUR HAIR IS?

23:24.730 --> 23:28.939
IT'S PRETTY SOFT.
IT'S VERY SOFT.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.437
OKAY.
IT'S PRETTY SOFT.

23:30.470 --> 23:32.438
I'M GONNA GET THE NURSE.

23:34.740 --> 23:36.833
(door buzzes and beeps)

23:36.880 --> 23:38.905
(radio chatter,
telephone ringing)

23:38.950 --> 23:40.577
ALL RIGHT,
PRISONER FEEDING TIME.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.110
(door closes)
YOU'RE LUCKY.

23:42.150 --> 23:43.708
WE STILL HAD ONE LEFT.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.684
THANKS, MAN.
I WISH I COULD PARTAKE,

23:45.720 --> 23:47.915
BUT I ABSTAIN FROM GLUTEN.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.724
I READ ON THE INTERNET
IT KILLS BRAIN CELLS.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.149
I WANNA HOLD ONTO THESE BAD BOYS
AS LONG AS I CAN.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.658
YEAH, WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'D BE CONCERNED.
(turns doorknob)

23:55.700 --> 23:57.964
HEY, DID THEY FIND
THE DUDE WHO ICED IVAN?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.627
LIKE, CAN I GO YET?

23:59.670 --> 24:01.968
NO. NOT YET. YOU STILL HAVEN'T
BEEN CLEARED AS A SUSPECT.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.059
UNLIKELY.
CAN'T YOU JUST RELEASE ME

24:04.110 --> 24:06.169
ON A PROMISE TO APPEAR
OR SOME CRAP?

24:06.210 --> 24:07.837
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THOSE?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.108
(scoffs) DUDE, LOOK AT ME.

24:09.140 --> 24:12.075
(packaging rustles)
OBVIOUSLY, I WATCH
A TON OF TELEVISION.

24:12.110 --> 24:14.749
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
EAT GLUTEN.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.715
(mouth full) OH. YEAH.
I FORGOT.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.611
(door buzzes and beeps)

24:21.660 --> 24:24.049
SO THE HOUSE IS REGISTERED
TO OUR VICTIM, IVAN GERTNER.

24:24.090 --> 24:25.728
OH.
IT'S THE ONLY NAME
ON THE MORTGAGE.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.159
HE MADE THE DOWN PAYMENT
IN CASH.

24:27.190 --> 24:28.919
THERE'S NO STEADY JOB.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.860
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE MONEY'S COMING FROM.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.539
FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.561
GOOD ONE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
INCOMING.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.931
(Traci) OH. HERE WE GO.

24:36.970 --> 24:40.064
(indistinct conversations)

24:40.110 --> 24:41.532
STEVE PECK.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.933
TRACI NASH.

24:42.980 --> 24:43.947
DO--DO YOU WANNA HEAR
SOMETHING FUNNY?

24:43.980 --> 24:44.947
YEAH.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.868
SOMEONE TOLD ME YOU'RE WORKING
THE EUCLID CASE,

24:46.910 --> 24:49.140
INDEPENDENT FROM GUNS AND GANGS.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.513
I'M A DETECTIVE
WORKING A HOMICIDE CASE.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.586
AND I'M A DETECTIVE FILLING IN
GAPS BETWEEN THIS GROW-OP

24:54.620 --> 24:56.679
AND ITS CONNECTION TO
THE PORTUGUESE IN THE AREA.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.119
SO... WHAT, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU WORRIED

24:58.160 --> 24:59.923
THAT I'M CRAMPING
YOUR STYLE?

24:59.960 --> 25:01.689
NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M JUST WORRIED
YOU'RE GONNA GET LOST IN THE MIX

25:01.730 --> 25:03.891
AND I'D--I'D HATE
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

25:03.930 --> 25:07.024
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LIKE YOU, NASH.
WOW.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.698
YOU ALWAYS THIS GOOD
WITH WOMEN?
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

25:09.740 --> 25:12.300
WORK THE CASE, BUT I GOTTA
WARN YOU. I GOT A...

25:12.340 --> 25:14.638
(pats folder)
HELL OF A HEAD START
ON THIS ONE.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.001
JUST SAYING.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.941
HEY. IDENT ASKED ME
TO PASS ALONG A MESSAGE.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.572
THE PRINTS CAME BACK
ON THE BULLET CASING

25:21.620 --> 25:23.815
FROM THE GROW-OP.
GUY NAMED GIL ABRINO.

25:23.850 --> 25:24.987
KNOWN GANG AFFILIATIONS.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.113
GOOD. LET'S GO PICK HIM UP.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.755
(radio chatter)

25:36.200 --> 25:37.599
CHRIS, WE'RE GOING IN CIRCLES.
DON'T SAY THAT.

25:37.630 --> 25:40.098
IT'S TRUE.
WOULD YOU STOP?

25:40.130 --> 25:41.859
I MEAN, WHEN--
WHEN DO YOU EVEN THINK

25:41.900 --> 25:42.867
THEY'RE GONNA NOTICE
WE'RE MISSING?
OH. (mutters) STUPID...

25:42.900 --> 25:44.265
PROBABLY WHEN THEY WAKE UP
TOMORROW MORNING,

25:44.310 --> 25:47.063
THEY NOTICE THAT WE'RE NOT
HERE TO COOK 'EM BREAKFAST.
(grunting)

25:47.110 --> 25:49.135
UHH!

25:49.180 --> 25:53.071
(grunting)

25:53.110 --> 25:54.839
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA BURN.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.815
I DON'T CARE
IF IT BURNS OR NOT!
(whacking)

25:57.850 --> 26:00.819
I AM SICK AND TIRED
OF HEARING YOU COMPLAIN!
(clatter)

26:00.860 --> 26:03.579
YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED
SINCE WE GOT OUT HERE.

26:03.630 --> 26:06.622
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD
IT WAS FOR ME TO COME BACK HERE?

26:06.660 --> 26:08.252
I HAD TO TURN MY LIFE
UPSIDE DOWN.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.962
I SACRIFICED EVERYTHING
TO DO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.867
AND THINGS JUST GOT WORSE.
AND WHAT DID IT GET ME?

26:13.900 --> 26:15.731
I GOTTA STAND OUT HERE
AND LISTEN TO YOU COMPLAIN

26:15.770 --> 26:17.260
ABOUT WHERE YOU SIT
IN THE DIVISIONAL PECKING ORDER.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.506
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT!

26:18.540 --> 26:21.270
I DIDN'T WANNA COME TO THIS
STUPID CABIN IN THE FIRST PLACE!

26:21.310 --> 26:23.232
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
SAID SIODWIIETHING.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.874
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID IT
LOUDER.

26:25.910 --> 26:26.945
CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

26:26.980 --> 26:29.778
YOU'RE SO BUSY MAKING DECISIONS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

26:29.820 --> 26:31.742
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ANYMORE.

26:31.790 --> 26:32.882
OH, SO I SHOULD BE
SELFISH LIKE YOU?

26:32.920 --> 26:36.048
NOT SELFISH.
JUST NOT SPINELESS.

26:36.090 --> 26:38.627
IT'S OKAY TO DO THINGS
THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.151
YOU HAPPY.
YOU USED TO KNOW THAT.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.318
(birds calling)

26:45.370 --> 26:47.895
I'M SORRY.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.293
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD
A HARD TIME RECENTLY.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.870
LOOK, WHEN I WAS
IN TIMMINS... (sniffles)

26:53.910 --> 26:56.174
NOBODY TREATED ME
LIKE A ROOKIE,

26:56.210 --> 26:59.407
BECAUSE NOBODY THERE THOUGHT
I WAS ONE, INCLUDING ME.

26:59.450 --> 27:01.077
SO I WASN'T.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.112
(vehicle approaches)

27:04.150 --> 27:05.412
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SEMI.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.111
THERE'S--THERE'S GOTTA BE
A HIGHWAY OVER THERE.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.881
(grunts)
I'M KEEPING THIS.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.057
LET'S JUST GET
THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.898
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

27:16.930 --> 27:20.161
YOU KNOW, 40-YEAR-OLD DIVORC
WITH 3 KIDS, THIS CABIN.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.339
MY GIRLFRIEND IS A WICCAN,
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.861
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
BUT...

27:24.910 --> 27:28.778
YOU KNOW, THIS...
(exhales deeply)

27:28.810 --> 27:30.402
THIS IS A MID-LIFE CRISIS.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.971
I MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE
WITH CELERY?

27:35.950 --> 27:36.974
YES.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.715
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

27:38.750 --> 27:40.889
A FEELING.
I SEE YOU TWO TOGETHER,

27:40.920 --> 27:42.683
AND I KNOW SHE'S RIGHT
FOR YOU.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.755
LIKE YOU AND MCNALLY?

27:43.790 --> 27:45.826
EXACTLY.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.896
(chair creaks)

27:49.930 --> 27:51.818
(chuckles)

27:53.470 --> 27:55.028
YOU KNOW WHAT? AHEM.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.435
YOU GOT
THREE BEAUTIFUL KIDS...

27:56.470 --> 27:58.768
OH, NO, NO.
A GIRLFRIEND.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.778
YEAH, YOU'RE DIVORCED,
BUT, UH,

28:00.810 --> 28:02.277
YOU OWN A CABIN, AT LEAST.

28:02.310 --> 28:04.699
UH-HUH. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, MAN.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.377
YOU'RE MOVING.... FORWARD.

28:06.410 --> 28:09.413
SO DON'T COMPLAIN, ALL RIGHT?
DON'T COMPLAIN.

28:09.450 --> 28:12.715
I DIDN'T COME UP HERE
TO LISTEN TO YOU MOPE.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.957
OH. (chuckles) YEAH,
THAT IS RICH. THAT'S GOOD, MAN,

28:14.990 --> 28:15.911
COMING FROM YOU.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.780
ALL RIGHT. CONSIDERING
I JUST WATCHED YOU MOPE

28:17.830 --> 28:19.024
FOR THE LAST YEAR, HUH?

28:19.060 --> 28:22.996
EVER--EVER SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
OUT OF UNIFORM AND MCNALLY LEFT.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.396
NAME ONE TIME
YOU SAW ME MOPE.

28:25.430 --> 28:28.263
I WATCH YOU MOPE
ON THE INSIDE.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.767
I KNOW. THAT MIGHT NOT
MAKE ANY SENSE,

28:29.800 --> 28:30.869
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
HERE'S ANOTHER THING.

28:30.910 --> 28:34.277
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL BET YOU MARLO SEES IT, TOO.

28:34.310 --> 28:36.437
YOU KNOW? HUH?
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.778
I'VE BEEN ON THAT SIDE,

28:38.810 --> 28:39.845
YOU KNOW, WITH ZOE.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.041
AND THAT IS--THAT IS, UH,
NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE IN.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.241
IT HURTS, AND IT SCREWS
WITH YOUR HEAD.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.941
(sighs)

28:46.990 --> 28:48.389
(chuckles)

28:48.420 --> 28:50.456
I MISS HER, MAN.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.896
I WISH I DIDN'T,
BUT I DO.

28:56.930 --> 29:01.037
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

29:01.070 --> 29:03.903
KIDS, PARK ON SUNDAYS.

29:03.940 --> 29:09.776
REAL LIFE.
SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS...

29:09.810 --> 29:13.439
WITH HER.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.048
YOU GOTTA TELL MARLO.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.887
(sighs)

29:23.930 --> 29:26.558
HOW DID WE GET
ONTO THIS?

29:26.590 --> 29:28.319
THEY...

29:30.330 --> 29:32.560
THEY SAID WHEN WE GET OLDER,
THIS WOULD GET EASIER.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.468
WELL... THEY LIED.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.570
* HELLO, MY BABY

29:41.610 --> 29:43.009
(Andy) GAIL.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.576
* HELLO, MY HONEY
GAIL.

29:44.610 --> 29:47.170
(nasal voice)
* I'M A RAGTIME GAL

29:47.210 --> 29:48.177
GAIL.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.040
* SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE

29:50.080 --> 29:52.514
I SLEPT WITH NICK.

29:52.550 --> 29:54.950
I'M SORRY.

29:54.990 --> 29:58.050
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

29:58.090 --> 30:00.888
YOU...

30:00.930 --> 30:02.192
AND NICK.

30:02.230 --> 30:03.197
YES.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.527
SLEPT TOGETHER?

30:04.570 --> 30:06.265
YES.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.300
(telephone ringing in distance)

30:11.340 --> 30:12.932
I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.198
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU KNEW?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.601
SO THIS WHOLE TIME THAT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU,

30:17.640 --> 30:21.474
YOU'VE JUST BEEN--
JUDGING YOU? YEAH.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.841
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.187
OH.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.951
WELL, I MEAN, I COULD--
I COULD CRY.

30:28.990 --> 30:30.457
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CRY?

30:30.490 --> 30:31.582
NO.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.052
OR I COULD TELL YOU
HOW RIGHT

30:33.090 --> 30:35.923
I THINK YOU AND NICK ARE
FOR EACH OTHER,

30:35.960 --> 30:37.598
AND THEN I COULD GAG
ON MY OWN WORDS. I DON'T KNOW.

30:37.630 --> 30:40.224
IT JUST ALL DEPENDS
ON WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING.

30:40.270 --> 30:41.897
I WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING
ANYTHING.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.329
WELL... OTHER THAN HOPING

30:44.370 --> 30:47.362
THAT MAYBE WE COULD TALK
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.

30:47.410 --> 30:50.379
YOU'RE KILLING MY MELLOW,
MAN.

30:50.410 --> 30:51.946
GET OUT.

30:51.980 --> 30:52.969
WHAT?

30:53.010 --> 30:54.409
JUST... MOVE IT.

31:00.350 --> 31:01.487
YOU KNOW WHAT, GAIL? WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS--

31:01.520 --> 31:04.227
I SAID BEAT IT, NARC.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.491
(radio chatter)

31:08.530 --> 31:09.997
IT'S GIL ABRINO?

31:10.030 --> 31:11.065
YEAH, BUT, TRACI,
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT GIL

31:11.100 --> 31:12.067
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.489
(speaks Portuguese)

31:14.540 --> 31:16.360
YEAH. HE ONLY SPEAKS
PORTUGUESE.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.301
PERFECT. TALK TO STAFF,
TELL HIM WE NEED AN INTERPRETER.

31:19.340 --> 31:21.570
OH, ACT UALLY--
OF COURSE, BY THE TIME
THE INTERPRETER GETS HERE,

31:21.610 --> 31:22.429
THIS GUY'S GONNA BE LAWYERED UP,

31:22.480 --> 31:23.469
AND WE'LL NEVER
GET ANYTHING OUT OF HIM.

31:23.510 --> 31:25.398
MEANWHILE, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT CHUCK?

31:25.450 --> 31:26.940
LET'S RELEASE HIM
ON A PROMISE TO APPEAR.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.470
AHEM!
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.909
CHLOE PREO A SEU SERVICO.

31:30.950 --> 31:33.111
I-I SPEAK PORTUGUESE.

31:33.150 --> 31:35.015
YOU DO?
MM-HMM.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.459
OKAY. GET HIM
INTO INTERVIEW THREE

31:36.490 --> 31:37.457
AND WAIT FOR ME.

31:37.490 --> 31:40.129
(speaks Portuguese)

31:48.740 --> 31:51.038
(speaks Portuguese)

31:51.070 --> 31:54.005
(speaks Portuguese)

32:14.400 --> 32:16.220
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32:16.260 --> 32:18.160
WELL, WE KNOW HE HAS
GANG AFFILIATIONS.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.020
WE ALSO HAVE HIS CELL PHONE,
SO I'M JUST GONNA MAKE

32:20.070 --> 32:21.697
SOME CALLS
TO HIS PORTUGUESE GANG BUDDIES

32:21.740 --> 32:23.230
AND TELL THEM
THAT MR. ABRINO HERE

32:23.270 --> 32:25.363
GAVE US THEIR CELL PHONE NUMBER.

32:25.410 --> 32:26.661
YOU DO THAT,
AND MY FAMILY'S DEAD.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.007
YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?

32:28.040 --> 32:30.474
I KNEW IT. I TOTALLY KNEW IT.
HOW?

32:30.510 --> 32:32.569
WELL, HE USED THE EXPRESSION
"BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE,"

32:32.610 --> 32:34.214
WHICH IS AN ENGLISH EXPRESSION.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.070
PORTUGUESE ONE
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.747
THERE'S NO TREE, NO DOGS.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.645
I FIGURED I'D GIVE IT A TRY.

32:39.690 --> 32:42.750
LOOK... I HAVE A WIFE
AND A SON.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.519
YOU TELL MY BOSS
THAT I'M A RAT, AND I'M DEAD.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.754
THEY'RE DEAD.

32:45.790 --> 32:47.280
TELL US
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW,

32:47.330 --> 32:48.957
WE WON'T HAVE TO ASK
YOUR FRIENDS.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.528
I GOT A CALL LAST WEEK
FROM MY BOSS.

32:56.570 --> 32:59.004
HE SAYS THAT WE'RE TAKING OVER
THE GROW HOUSE ON EUCLID

32:59.040 --> 33:02.476
AND THAT I GOTTA TAKE THE GUY
OUT WHO WORKS THERE--IVAN.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.273
THINGS DIDN'T GO
AS PLANNED?

33:04.310 --> 33:07.279
I FROZE.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.369
HE CAME AT ME. I PANICKED.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.479
I JUST DROPPED THE GUN,
AND I TOOK OFF.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.613
SO WHO FINISHED THE JOB?

33:13.650 --> 33:15.686
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO CALL THIS ONE NUMBER

33:15.720 --> 33:17.153
WHEN I WAS DONE.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.078
YOU STILL HAVE
THAT NUMBER IN YOUR PHONE?

33:21.630 --> 33:24.019
LET'S GO FIND OUT WHO
THAT NUMBER BELONGS TO.

33:24.070 --> 33:28.166
(door buzzes)

33:28.200 --> 33:29.132
IT'S GOTTA BE
ONE OF THE LAST NUMBERS.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.694
I HEARD YOU BROUGHT IN ABRINO.
WHERE IS HE?

33:30.740 --> 33:32.264
I WANNA TALK TO HIM.
DON'T BOTHER.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.106
WE DON'T THINK
HE DID IT.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.505
THEY ORDERED ABRINO
TO DO THE HIT,

33:34.540 --> 33:35.529
BUT HE BOTCHED THE JOB.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.707
SOMEBODY FOUND OUT
AND TOOK CARE OF IT FOR HIM.

33:37.740 --> 33:39.605
SO... YOU BELIEVE HIM?
I DON'T KNOW YET.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.049
GAVE US THE NUMBER
THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL

33:41.080 --> 33:43.446
AFTER THE HIT.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.084
SO WHAT, NOW YOU'RE JUST
GONNA CALL IT?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.247
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?

33:49.790 --> 33:52.156
(door buzzes and beeps)
HEY, GUESS WHO'S
GETTING OUT OF HERE.

33:52.190 --> 33:53.555
KIND OF UNFAIR, BRO.
(door closes)

33:53.590 --> 33:55.091
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO ELSE IS IN HERE.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.348
IT'S YOU, CHUCK.
TURNS OUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.822
YOU'RE BEING RELEASED
ON A PROMISE TO APPEAR.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.089
WOOT-WOOT! (laughs)
WHAT ABOUT MY STUFF?

34:02.140 --> 34:03.664
IT'S ALL IN HERE.
YOU'LL GET IT AT RECEPTION.

34:03.700 --> 34:07.261
HEY, COULD I... GET SOME WATER
FOR THE ROAD, MAN?

34:07.310 --> 34:09.801
I'M PARCHED.
OR A PETITE SNACKAGE?

34:09.840 --> 34:12.104
WHAT IS THIS, THE RITZ?
I GAVE YOU A GRANOLA BAR.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.777
YEAH, BUT I ONLY ATE HALF
ON ACCOUNT OF THE GLU--

34:13.810 --> 34:15.641
THE GLUTEN. RIGHT, FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:15.680 --> 34:17.773
YOU SIT TIGHT.
I WILL GET YOU SOME WATER.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.708
YOU CAN GET A SNACK
AFTER YOU LEAVE.
(door buzzes and beeps)

34:19.750 --> 34:21.354
AGUA FOR CHUCKUA?

34:21.390 --> 34:24.154
(radio chatter)

34:24.190 --> 34:25.418
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

34:25.460 --> 34:26.757
I'M ABRINO'S WIFE.
DON'T SAY TOO MUCH.

34:26.790 --> 34:27.757
KEEP THEM ON THE PHONE
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

34:27.790 --> 34:28.825
THIS IS RIGHT.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.499
YEAH. HERE GOES NOTHING.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.225
HEY, MAN, HOW'S IT GOING?
YOU KNOW.

34:33.270 --> 34:37.161
(coins clatter,
cell phone rings)

34:37.200 --> 34:39.236
(ring, can clatters)

34:39.270 --> 34:40.635
NO--NO ONE'S PICKING UP.

34:40.670 --> 34:43.104
SEE IF HE HAS VOICEMAIL.
OKAY.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.607
(ï¬ng)

34:44.650 --> 34:48.108
(ï¬ng)

34:48.150 --> 34:50.641
(ï¬ng)

34:50.680 --> 34:51.783
(ï¬ng)

34:51.820 --> 34:52.844
(ringing stops)

34:56.560 --> 34:57.652
(ring, beep)

34:57.690 --> 34:58.782
THAT WAS A BUST.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.298
WAIT. HOLD ON.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.127
(door buzzes and beeps)
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

35:04.400 --> 35:07.198
(sighs)

35:07.230 --> 35:09.130
TRY IT AGAIN.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.365
(beep)

35:11.410 --> 35:13.901
(cell phone rings)

35:13.940 --> 35:16.500
(ringing)
SOMEBODY'S REALLY TRYING
TO GET AHOLD OF YOU.

35:16.540 --> 35:17.438
IT'S PROBABLY MY MOM.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.471
SHE'S KIND OF OVERPROTECT IVE,
YOU KNOW?

35:19.510 --> 35:21.239
(ï¬ng)

35:21.280 --> 35:23.145
(ring, beep)
NOTHING.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.886
ONE MORE TIME.
(beep)

35:27.520 --> 35:29.784
CHUCK, EASY, EASY.
WE'RE NOT IN A RACE.

35:31.290 --> 35:34.498
(cell phone rings)

35:34.530 --> 35:36.657
(ï¬ng)
NICK!

35:36.700 --> 35:38.759
(ï¬ng)

35:38.800 --> 35:41.234
NICK!

35:41.270 --> 35:42.362
NICK! WAIT.
(ï¬ng)

35:42.400 --> 35:44.937
HEY! STOP!

35:44.970 --> 35:47.200
(ring, beep)

35:47.240 --> 35:51.301
CHLOE?

35:51.350 --> 35:52.408
CUFF HIM.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.419
(handcuffs jangle)

35:56.950 --> 35:58.611
(speaks inaudibly)

36:00.390 --> 36:02.881
THE BURNOUT
WITH A HEART OF GOLD.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.820
THAT'S A GOOD COVER.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.418
I ALMOST BOUGHT IT, TOO.

36:06.460 --> 36:08.394
(door buzzes and beeps)

36:08.430 --> 36:10.728
(radio chatter)

36:14.740 --> 36:15.798
ARE WE HAVING A YARD SALE?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.638
WHEN IVAN BOUGHT THE HOUSE
ON EUCLID,

36:18.670 --> 36:23.232
HE MADE A $10,000
DOWN PAYMENT IN CASH. OKAY?

36:23.280 --> 36:26.602
A WEEK BEFORE THAT,
YOU TOOK OUT...

36:26.650 --> 36:30.279
THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT
FROM YOUR ACCOUNT.

36:30.320 --> 36:34.381
ALL I SEE IS A GUY
WHO'S BAD WITH HIS DOUGH.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.251
YOU WERE PARTNERS
WITH IVAN.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.485
YOU FRONTED THE MONEY
FOR THE GROW HOUSE.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.259
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO MADE
THE DEAL WITH THE PORTUGUESE

36:40.290 --> 36:41.689
TO EXPAND YOUR BUSINESS.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.493
BUT IVAN WASN'T INTO THAT.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.929
SO HE HAD TO GO.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.928
KEEP GOING.
THIS IS AWESOME, REALLY.

36:47.970 --> 36:49.938
OKAY, WELL, GIL TOLD US

36:49.970 --> 36:50.891
THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO CALL YOUR CELL PHONE

36:50.940 --> 36:53.761
WHEN THE JOB WAS DONE,
BUT HE NEVER CALLED.

36:53.810 --> 36:56.335
YOU PHONED HIM.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.743
YOU PHONED HIM...
19 TIMES THIS MORNING

37:00.780 --> 37:02.372
'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

37:02.420 --> 37:05.480
BUT HE DIDN'T ANSWER
BECAUSE HE CHICKENED OUT.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.284
SO YOU HAD TO TAKE CARE
OF IVAN YOURSELF.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.380
MAYBE, OR MAYBE
THE EASTER BUNNY KILLED IVAN

37:11.430 --> 37:14.649
'CAUSE THEY WERE FIGHTING
OVER THE TOOTH FAIRY.

37:14.700 --> 37:17.396
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
TO GET IVAN INTO THAT DRUM...

37:17.430 --> 37:18.624
MM-HMM.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.865
AFTER YOU SHOT HIM.

37:20.900 --> 37:24.404
WRESTLING WITH THE BODY
IS PROBABLY EASY. LOSE A HAIR.

37:24.440 --> 37:25.930
YEAH,
AND IT WON'T TAKE LONG

37:25.970 --> 37:27.631
FOR US TO FIND
THE KILLER'S D.N.A.

37:27.670 --> 37:29.831
ON IVAN'S BODY.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.440
AND WHEN WE DO...

37:32.480 --> 37:33.799
(packaging rustling)
WE'LL JUST MATCH IT

37:33.850 --> 37:36.341
TO THE D.N.A. FOUND
ON THIS.

37:48.730 --> 37:51.290
WHAT'S A GUY GOTTA DO
AROUND HERE TO GET A LAWYER?

37:55.900 --> 37:57.959
(switch clicks)
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN?

37:58.000 --> 37:58.967
(Sam)
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LEG?

37:59.010 --> 38:00.602
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.505
(Dov) WHY IS THE GENERATOR
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

38:02.540 --> 38:03.802
YOU GUYS STILL HAVEN'T
FIXED IT?

38:03.840 --> 38:05.774
WELL, WE GOT
A LITTLE DISTRACT ED.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.346
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST STAND BACK.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.199
OKAY, DOV AND I
GOT THIS.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.343
OF COURSE. YOU KNOW
HOW TO FIX THIS.

38:10.380 --> 38:11.517
YOU JUST DIDN'T
TELL US.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.484
WELL, YOU NEVER ASKED.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.010
SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU WILL NEXT TIME.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.948
(chuckles)

38:16.990 --> 38:19.424
SO WHO'S GRABBING
OUR BEERS?

38:19.460 --> 38:22.099
(Donovan Woods)
* I WAS GONNA GO BACK HOME

38:22.130 --> 38:26.692
* OH, IF SHE HAD THEM
SPREAD OUT ON THE FLOOR *

38:26.730 --> 38:28.436
I WAS LUCKY TODAY.

38:28.470 --> 38:29.539
LUCKY?

38:29.570 --> 38:32.767
YEAH, WHAT WERE THE ODDS

38:32.810 --> 38:37.838
HIGH TANO. IT'S SWAHILI

38:37.880 --> 38:39.074
SWAHILI?

38:39.110 --> 38:43.376
YEAH. SWAHILI, PORTUGUESE,
SPANISH, GERMAN...

38:43.420 --> 38:44.910
WELL, ACTUALLY,
WHAT ELSE CAN I SPEAK?

38:44.950 --> 38:48.818
AMAZING. SERIOUSLY, CHLOE,
YOU WERE A ROCK STAR TODAY.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.816
* IF SHE'S NOT
COMING OVER LATELY *

38:50.860 --> 38:52.589

GRACIAS.

38:53.630 --> 38:55.655
* I WAS GONNA GO BACK HOME

38:57.600 --> 39:00.125

WANTED TO BE SOMEBODY.

THESE DAYS.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.702
YOUR FIRST HOMICIDE CASE.

39:05.740 --> 39:06.900
YOU NAILED IT.

39:06.940 --> 39:08.635

39:08.680 --> 39:10.079

39:10.110 --> 39:11.099
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:11.140 --> 39:13.574
WELL, YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE MY NUMBER

39:13.610 --> 39:15.373
WHEN IT SHOWS UP, SO...

39:15.420 --> 39:16.819
(buttons click)

39:16.850 --> 39:18.909
I THOUGHT I'D MAKE IT
EASIER FOR YOU.

39:18.950 --> 39:21.453
THERE.

39:21.490 --> 39:24.653
"CAPTAIN OF THE UNIVERSE"?

over P.A.)

40:20.980 --> 40:22.868
WHAT? ARE YOU STILL HERE?

40:22.920 --> 40:24.444

40:52.810 --> 40:54.107
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DATE
A FRIEND'S EX.

40:54.150 --> 40:56.710
YOU'RE NEVER--NEVER SUPPOSED
TO DATE A FRIEND'S EX,

40:56.750 --> 41:00.948
BUT... THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT IT.

41:02.220 --> 41:03.881
THAT'S YOUR PUNISHMENT.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.683

engine starts)

42:02.350 --> 42:03.977
OKAY. (sighs)

42:04.020 --> 42:05.248
JUST HAD TO MAKE SURE.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.178
(siren wailing)
MAKE SURE OF WHAT?

42:07.220 --> 42:10.257
THAT IT WAS WORTH IT.

42:10.290 --> 42:14.158
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKED, AND THEN...
PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE.

42:14.190 --> 42:17.057
OKAY. SO?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKIN'?

42:19.330 --> 42:21.161
TELL YOU IN THE MORNING.
