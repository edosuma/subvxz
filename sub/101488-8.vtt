WEBVTT

00:21.396 --> 00:23.189
-Great burger, Bob.
-Thanks, Teddy.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.025
Might have another one.
I don't even care

00:25.108 --> 00:27.068
-that I'm allergic to eggplant.
-Wait. You are?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.737
Yep. Makes me wheezy and itchy.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.697
Teddy, why'd you order
the burger of the day?

00:30.780 --> 00:32.198
It's got "eggplant" right in the name.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.076
Bob was so excited about it.
I wanted to be supportive.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.453
Plus, I have eggs all the time,

00:36.536 --> 00:37.996
and those don't seem to bother me.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.081
You know that eggs aren't
related to eggplant, right?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.499
-What do you mean?
-Never mind.
-(phone rings)

00:41.583 --> 00:42.834
Bob's Burgers.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.544
Linda, it's Ma!

00:44.627 --> 00:46.588
I'm calling you on the telephone.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.882
-Can you hear me?
-Ma. Hi.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.092
How's your trip going?
How's Uncle Ricky?

00:51.176 --> 00:53.386
He's fine. He got a new hip,

00:53.470 --> 00:57.349
but it's not the right size,
so he's walking in circles.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.143
-Aw.
-Listen, we're at the airport
in Connecticut.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.978
We're about to get on a plane,

01:02.062 --> 01:05.065
-but we have a layover near you.
-Uh-huh...

01:05.148 --> 01:08.735
-We'll only be an hour
and a half from your place.
-Uh-huh.

01:08.818 --> 01:12.113
Yeah, so your father's eczema
is acting up again.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.824
He's starting to scratch like a dog.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.910
-Uh-huh.
-We need you to come

01:16.993 --> 01:20.914
to the layover airport
and bring us anti-itch cream.

01:20.997 --> 01:24.709
Uh, yeah.
Uh, w-we could do that, I-I think.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.379
-Uh-oh.
-Uh, you know what?
Um, can I call you right back?

01:27.462 --> 01:30.799
Okay, but I don't know if calls
can come into the airport.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.009
They can. It's a cell phone.
You'll see.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.969
Okay, I-I'll talk to you soon, Ma.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.263
Bob, my parents need us to meet
them during their layover

01:37.347 --> 01:38.765
and bring them some anti-itch cream.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.725
-You're joking, right?
-No, I'm not joking.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.894
My father's had eczema his entire life.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.063
When he was growing up,
everyone called him Corn Flakes.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.481
-Mm.
-So how about this?

01:46.564 --> 01:48.066
-We close the restaurant.
-No.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.401
We drive to the airport together.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.819
-Mm-mmm.
-You stay out in the car

01:50.902 --> 01:52.278
so we don't have to deal with parking.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.988
And then I run in
and give them the itch cream.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.615
-It's simple.
-I hate it.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.826
Uh, also, they-they shouldn't
have asked you to do that.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.662
-It-it seems like a lot to ask.
-Well, they asked.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.081
And, like, something you should say no to?

02:03.164 --> 02:04.290
Well, I didn't.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.834
Hey, if you do get to the airport,

02:05.917 --> 02:07.210
will you do me a favor
and grab me a snow globe?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.753
Mine broke.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.006
-Extra snowy please, but tasteful.
-Sure, Teddy.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.508
Lin, why can't your parents
just buy anti-itch cream there?

02:13.591 --> 02:16.219
They don't sell anti-itch cream
at the airport, Bob.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.346
That's one of the things
that's wrong with our society.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.889
(mumbles): Your parents
are what's wrong with our society.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.225
(gasps)
Wait a minute. Bob.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.060
What if this counted as our visit?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.395
Like our <i>visit </i>visit?

02:25.478 --> 02:26.563
Yeah.
We all go,

02:26.646 --> 02:28.523
we park, we go in, we have a visit.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.651
And then we don't have to go
to Florida in the spring?

02:31.735 --> 02:33.695
And then we don't
have to go to Florida in the spring.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.321
(chuckles)
I'm in. Let... Uh, let's go.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.906
-Teddy, get out.
-Mmm... Hey.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.283
Sorry.
I meant, uh, finish up,

02:38.366 --> 02:39.909
cause we're gonna close the restaurant.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.704
-Kids, guess what.
-Your tone says this is good news,

02:42.787 --> 02:44.748
but your body says there is no good news.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.750
Let me guess, you're finally allowing me

02:46.833 --> 02:48.543
to legally change my name to Geenathan?

02:48.626 --> 02:50.962
-That's great.
I'll call you Gene for short.
-I love it.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.380
No, we're going to the airport

02:52.464 --> 02:54.299
to see Grandma and Grandpa
on their layover.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.968
And we're stopping to get
anti-itch cream on the way.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.887
-Yay?
-Say the fun thing.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.472
Also, hopefully, you guys are picking up

03:00.555 --> 03:01.765
a sweet new snow globe.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.850
Money is no object.
But under nine dollars.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.853
Wait.
Why are <i>you </i>so excited about this, Dad?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.730
Uh, uh, what do you mean?

03:08.813 --> 03:10.523
We-we love your grandparents, obviously.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.485
-Obviously.
-And we look for opportunities

03:13.568 --> 03:15.278
to spend time with them, obviously.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.613
Obviously.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.114
And we are looking forward to spending

03:18.198 --> 03:20.533
an hour and a half today
in a really nice airport restaurant

03:20.617 --> 03:22.577
or snack bar and then never see them again

03:22.660 --> 03:25.038
-for the rest of the year.
-Oh, I see.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.207
So you want to spend an hour with them now

03:27.290 --> 03:28.708
so we don't have to go to Florida.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.876
Kind of like you're checking a box.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.252
Grandma's box?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.254
-Gene, don't say that.
-Say what? "Grandma's box"?

03:33.338 --> 03:34.631
-Mm.
-Okay. Come on.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.424
We're doing it.
We got to move, we got to move.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.967
Real quick, can I use your bathroom?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.053
I'll be, like, between
five and 30 minutes.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.680
Take it to-go, Teddy.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.441
Bob, I know you're happy about this,

03:53.525 --> 03:55.068
but I need you to make a promise.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.487
-Anything.
-Okay, actually three promises.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.239
One, you can't not talk.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.199
If this is gonna be a visit,
you have to talk.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.743
-Even to my dad.
Even if he can't hear you.
-Got it.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.746
Two, you can't bring up
the phone charger thing with my mom.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.039
She stole it, Lin.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.333
-She stole your phone charger.
-Get it out now.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.711
-And she won't admit it.
-Are we done?

04:12.794 --> 04:14.045
And now you take my phone
charger so I don't have

04:14.129 --> 04:15.380
a phone charger.
Okay, now I'm done.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.048
And three, you can't mention

04:17.132 --> 04:18.883
the book they got the kids for Christmas.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.302
You mean the book about
staying active in retirement?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.513
I'm pretty sure that was a regift.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.890
-There were a few good tips.
-I want to try Mahjong.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.392
It sounds delicious.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.894
Okay, I won't bring up that great gift.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.813
Even though there was a whole chapter

04:31.896 --> 04:33.648
about keeping your sex life alive.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.275
-With illustrations.
-Mm.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.527
Oh, we're getting closer.
Hi, plane.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.154
I can't wait till the day I actually get

04:39.237 --> 04:40.697
on my first real airplane.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.866
I'm gonna put my tray table
down and then up

04:42.949 --> 04:44.617
and then down and then up
and then down

04:44.701 --> 04:46.202
and then I'm gonna leave it down.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.830
I'm gonna put my seat
so far back I start a fight

04:48.913 --> 04:51.166
with the person behind me
and then make Mom beat him up.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.709
I'm gonna look out the window.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.586
Tina, honey, you've already
been on an airplane.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.629
-When you were little.
-Wait, really?

04:56.713 --> 04:58.340
Wha...
How come I didn't know about this?

04:58.423 --> 04:59.966
You and Gene weren't born yet.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.301
We went with Tina to Buffalo

05:01.384 --> 05:02.969
for my second cousin's third wedding.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.263
-That's how Tina got her wings.
-Her what?

05:05.347 --> 05:06.514
Her wings.
It's a pin.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.724
Pilots give them to the kids
when they fly.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.100
It's cute.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.518
So that's what those wings
on my dresser are.

05:10.602 --> 05:11.686
I thought that was a barrette

05:11.770 --> 05:12.771
that you gave me that hurts my head.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.522
Well, damn it, now I need wings.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.275
Yeah, me, too.
The pin and the food.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.985
Sorry, but I think
they only give them to kids

05:19.069 --> 05:21.237
who are actually traveling,
which you're not today.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.573
-They don't know that.
-Yeah, for all they know,

05:23.656 --> 05:26.159
we're business-children
on our way to close a huge deal.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.994
And we're not wearing suits
because we're young

05:28.078 --> 05:31.247
and we're hip and we're
the future of video marketing.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.041
LINDA:
Okay, we're gonna meet my parents

05:33.124 --> 05:35.418
in the food court since
we can't get past security.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.170
Because Mom's booty is the bomb.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.964
-Aw, thank you, Gene.
-Look at all the shops.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.217
There's a smoothie shop,
an electronics shop.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.053
There's even a whole shop
just for neck pillows. Finally.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.346
Uh, Lin, do you want to call your mom?

05:46.429 --> 05:48.014
-Let her know we're here?
-Oh, yeah.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.518
-Hello?
-Ma, it's Linda.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.103
I just wanted to let you know
that we parked,

05:53.186 --> 05:54.479
and we're on our way to the food court.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.815
Okay.
We just got on the shuttle.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.233
Shuttle? What shuttle?

05:58.316 --> 06:00.026
We followed some people off the plane

06:00.110 --> 06:01.903
and they got on a shuttle.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.446
I'm sitting next to a woman

06:03.530 --> 06:05.865
who's talking really loud on her phone!

06:05.949 --> 06:09.202
And the driver is driving too fast!

06:09.285 --> 06:12.330
-Wait, Mom, no! Uh, uh, shuttle?
-Oh, God.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.082
Al, stop itching.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.668
You're getting dead skin
all over that baby.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.170
-Linda, I have to call you back.
-Wait, Ma, don't...

06:19.254 --> 06:22.298
-Ugh. So they got on a shuttle.
-Yeah, I heard.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.093
Both sides of the conversation.
Because it was your mom.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.094
That's why we call her

06:26.177 --> 06:27.137
Grandma Speakerphone.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.430
All right, all right, don't worry.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.056
We'll, uh... we'll find them.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.850
I mean, h-how many shuttles can there be?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.810
Oh. Lots.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.813
-BOB: Crap.
-GENE: I think you mean, "holy shuttle."

06:39.274 --> 06:41.735
Darn it. I've called her three times
but she's not picking up

06:41.818 --> 06:44.446
-for some reason.
-Maybe she's just not that into you.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.448
I'm calling again.
Oh, pick up the frickin' phone.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.366
-Hello?
-(chuckles): Oh, hi, Ma.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.160
-Yeah, are you still on the shuttle?
-Yeah.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.203
Is that why you keep calling me?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.581
Yes. Listen, the shuttles
just go in a big loop.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.875
So stay on until you come back
around to the terminal

06:56.958 --> 06:58.501
-and then get off.
-Okay.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.337
Oh, I see the terminal now.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.422
-We're getting off.
-No, Ma.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.965
You can't be at the terminal.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.675
We're at the terminal. Ugh.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.761
-Hello?
-Maybe they're at the south terminal.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.179
GENE:
Ooh, the south terminal.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.431
I bet they have sweet tea
and lightning bugs.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.184
-That's probably where they are.
-Okay, everyone, come on.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.560
We're running to the south terminal.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.229
-Let's go.
-Running? What the hell?

07:18.313 --> 07:21.024
(panting):
Oh, my God. That was...

07:21.107 --> 07:23.151
That was so, so far.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.528
(panting):
I think we ran to a different airport.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.073
-Is this Greece?
-Look, there's Grandpa.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.074
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, Al.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.325
-Hey, Al.
-Aah!

07:30.408 --> 07:32.160
-Oh, hello.
-Hi, Dad.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.162
Here's your itch cream.
Wait, where's Ma?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.997
-She went back to the plane.
-What?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.665
What do you mean,
she went back to the plane?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.459
-She forgot something.
-What'd she forget?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.336
-Her magazine.
-Oh, my God.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.714
It was in the seat pocket.
It was called <i>Come And Jet It.</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:48.218
-Dad, that's a free magazine
they give out on every flight.
-Yeah, right.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.804
Oh, my God, she's never gonna
find her way back here.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.139
-We need to go get her.
-How? We can't get past security

07:53.223 --> 07:54.474
unless we have a ticket.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.101
Dad, do you have your plane ticket?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.519
No. Gloria has it.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.437
All I have is an extra battery

07:59.521 --> 08:01.064
-for my hearing aid.
-Crap.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.607
-What?
-He said crap!

08:02.691 --> 08:04.859
-Louise.
-Maybe we could just buy
a cheap ticket somewhere.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.403
How about Pittsburgh?
That's a place.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.571
Or Düsseldorf,
the birthplace of Stephen Dorff.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.740
Let's just go ask someone
at the counter for help.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.076
Okay. Dad, come on.
We got to go inside.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.412
Grandpa, we go to go inside!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.914
Oh, good.
I like going inside places.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.083
Like a big shot.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.836
-ID, please.
-Hi.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.421
Uh, I don't actually have a ticket.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.381
I'm just trying to help
my mom, because she's...

08:26.464 --> 08:28.133
Right.
Anyone assisting any unaccompanied minor

08:28.216 --> 08:30.468
or elderly traveler needs an escort pass.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.970
Can I see your mother's ticket?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.889
I don't have it,  cause she's not with us.

08:34.973 --> 08:37.600
I mean, she's not dead,
she's fine, but she's at the gate.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.019
Well, if she's at the gate,
it doesn't sound like

08:39.102 --> 08:40.145
she needs assistance.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.855
-Good point.
-Doing great, Mom.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.857
Uh, uh, let me, uh,
just jump in here quick.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.567
Hello.
Hi, I-I'm Bob.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.319
Uh, so the situation
is that her parents are in town

08:48.403 --> 08:50.488
on a layover and we were
just hoping to spend

08:50.572 --> 08:51.865
some family time with them.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.367
Just like, uh, an hour, two hours, tops.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.411
Actually that sounds like a lot,
saying it out loud.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.871
They're-they're really great.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.372
I mean I... I love them.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.666
-She did take my phone charger.
-Bob.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.251
Well, listen, I could bring her back,

09:03.335 --> 09:05.670
but I'm still gonna need proof
that they're actually related.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.589
Trust me, when you see my grandma,
you'll know

09:07.672 --> 09:09.466
my mom's apples
didn't fall far from that tree.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.010
-Gene.
-Our grandma's apples are just lower.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.219
-Louise.
-Also they both have big boobs.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.679
Oh, my God.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.473
-(phone vibrating)
-Oh, look. She's calling me.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.183
Ma... Hello? Hello?

09:18.266 --> 09:22.604
Linda, they won't let me back
on the plane to get my magazine.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.607
And also they're saying
this wasn't my plane.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.068
Ma, do you think you can find
your way back to us?

09:28.151 --> 09:30.278
Okay.
As soon as I get my magazine,

09:30.362 --> 09:32.447
I'll just get on another shuttle.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.240
No, no, no. You know what?
Don't move.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.076
I'll-I'll come to you.
But real quick,

09:36.159 --> 09:38.161
I need you to tell this nice man
that I'm your daughter.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.371
-Can you tell him that?
-What?

09:39.454 --> 09:41.790
Uh, okay, I'll escort you to the gate.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.333
Really?
You didn't even talk to her.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.751
Yeah, it's obvious she's your mother.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.336
You sound exactly the same.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.046
We do not sound exactly the same.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.464
-Eh
-Pretty close.
-Yeah, you do.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.549
Fine.
Bob, take my dad and the kids

09:51.633 --> 09:53.009
somewhere they can sit down.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.219
I'll call you when I got my mother.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.012
BOB:
So, Al,

09:56.096 --> 09:57.764
how's, uh, Florida?

09:57.847 --> 10:00.642
-Still w-where you live?
-My neck hurts.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.686
-Oh, uh, sorry to hear that.
-What?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.604
Uh, I'm sorry that your neck hurts.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.106
-How do <i>you </i>know?
-Oh.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.691
Because you said your neck hurts.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.776
Uh, and then I said sorry.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.070
And then that's where... where we're at,

10:12.153 --> 10:14.197
in this conversation.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.324
-My neck hurts.
-Mm-hmm. Yep.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.244
-Psst. Gene, do you see what I'm seeing?
-Yeah.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.745
Great gum selection.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.747
-I get why people travel now.
-No, the guy.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.291
I think he's a pilot,
Which means he's probably

10:25.375 --> 10:27.210
packing some wings in that roller bag.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.713
And a musky fragrance for men on the go.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.256
-What are you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.466
You wouldn't understand
since you already have wings.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.635
Hey, it's not my fault
I have an interesting past.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.429
(sighs)
I'm gonna get my wings.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.347
And I'm not gonna
be a wing-waster like you.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.641
I'm gonna take those babies and soar.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.446
Tell us about the world.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.698
Why tell you when I can show you?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.995
BOTH:
Yay!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.830
-I didn't know they worked that way.
-Pretty sure they do.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.790
They have unlimited power, Tina.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.709
Unlimited power.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.836
I'd like the jumbo Cajun tater tots

11:09.919 --> 11:11.588
with a side of strawberry chocolate milk.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.922
Uh, we don't have that.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.343
(gasps) Coming right up, sir.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.803
So you would just get more tater tots?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.889
I mean, Louise thinks
they'll make her fly.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.515
Don't make Louise feel bad
that she didn't think

11:22.599 --> 11:24.476
-of the tater tot thing first.
-Okay, Gene,

11:24.559 --> 11:26.019
if we're gonna do this, we got to do it.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.520
Hey, Dad, can we go over there

11:27.604 --> 11:28.897
and look at some airport stuff?

11:28.980 --> 11:31.649
Also, what's our gum budget
in this family-- 400?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.319
Yes, you can look at stuff.
Gum budget is zero.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.154
And don't go too far.
Your Grandpa Al and I

11:36.237 --> 11:37.739
will just be here, talking.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.491
Oh, he closed his eyes.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.369
Well, brother, looks like
we have just a few minutes

11:42.452 --> 11:43.912
before we board our flight.

11:43.995 --> 11:47.040
Yep, our very first flight on a plane,

11:47.123 --> 11:48.541
in the sky.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.377
Not mine.
Already ridden that pony.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.171
Excuse me, I couldn't help but
overhear you kids talking.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.631
Is today really your first flight?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.758
It sure is.
We're headed to, uh...

11:56.841 --> 12:00.428
-Montana.
-Yeah, Montana, to see, uh...

12:00.512 --> 12:04.224
-The ocean.
-Yep, yep, we're gonna
see the Montana coast.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.393
It's gonna be amazing.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.478
Sure would be nice
to commemorate this special day

12:08.561 --> 12:10.605
with some tiny metal object that I could,

12:10.689 --> 12:12.649
I don't know, pin on my clothes.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.901
Ha, probably just some stupid dream.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.569
Well, you're in luck.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.071
How would you like some wings?

12:18.154 --> 12:21.408
What?! Thank you.
We were not expecting this.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.159
Oh, bummer city.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.369
-Aw.
-What? What's wrong?

12:24.452 --> 12:25.412
It looks like I'm all out.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.831
Ha, ha, that's funny.
Pilot humor.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.125
-But seriously.
-I'm sure the pilot on your flight

12:30.208 --> 12:32.335
will have some.
Have a great time in Montana.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.630
-Ugh!
-So I guess I'm still
the only kid in the family

12:35.714 --> 12:37.966
-with wing bling.
-Tina, I'm gonna tell everyone in Montana

12:38.049 --> 12:39.592
what a monster you are.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.595
-Ah, there she is. Ma!
-Linda!

12:42.679 --> 12:45.557
Thank God.
This lady's trying to give me

12:45.640 --> 12:49.394
another magazine,
but it doesn't have Sam Elliott in it.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.855
I want the one with Sam Elliott in it.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.606
Mom, please just take the magazine.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.358
The whole family's waiting for us.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.986
Fine.
But I'm giving you a low score

12:58.069 --> 12:59.779
on the customer survey,

12:59.863 --> 13:03.199
and I will not forget your name, Delta.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.618
-Bob, we found her.
-Gloria, hi.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.662
-So, uh, great to see you.
-Bob.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.830
-Grandma.
-Hi, Grandma.
-Sup, Grams?

13:08.913 --> 13:11.166
-Hi, kids.
-Uh, let's get visiting, huh?

13:11.249 --> 13:13.335
I mean, this already feels
like such a good visit.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.545
Me and Al were just getting into it.
Wait.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.547
-Where's Al?
-Yeah, where is he?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.716
Huh, that's weird.
He was just here a second ago.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.176
He-he must have walked away.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.510
You don't know if he walked away?

13:22.594 --> 13:23.762
What have you been doing?

13:23.845 --> 13:26.097
Well, we were having
such a great conversation

13:26.181 --> 13:29.851
that I may have started
watching, um, this. Uh, sports.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.228
-Sports?
-Yeah. I think it's basketball.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
-Basketball?
-Yeah, it's definitely basketball.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.982
-Yeah, bro.
-Al!

13:36.066 --> 13:38.651
-Great job, Bob. You lost my father.
-Al!

13:38.735 --> 13:41.112
You know what they say.
If you love something,

13:41.196 --> 13:42.864
let it go walking off in an airport.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.407
Al!

13:46.868 --> 13:48.703
-Al?
-I don't understand how my father

13:48.787 --> 13:50.246
could have just wandered off.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.749
I must have been distracted by the sports.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.209
-I'm really sorry.
-(cell phone vibrates)

13:54.292 --> 13:55.710
Teddy, it's not a good time.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.128
-I was just calling to see
-(beeping)

13:57.212 --> 13:59.130
if you tracked down a snow globe yet.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.092
No, Teddy, we're-we're dealing
with bigger problems right now.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.760
Wait, what's that beeping noise?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.471
-Well, I'm in the ER.
-What? Oh, God.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.431
Turns out that eggplant I ate earlier--

14:08.515 --> 14:11.184
I started to asphyxiate just a little bit.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.061
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.604
-Don't worry about me.
-GLORIA: Al!

14:14.688 --> 14:16.398
Okay, Teddy, I-I got to go.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.899
Sorry about your throat.
Please don't die, okay?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.484
Don't forget my snow...

14:19.567 --> 14:22.028
It's okay, Ma,
we're gonna find him, right, Bob?

14:22.112 --> 14:23.655
Because their flight is leaving soon,

14:23.738 --> 14:26.574
and if we don't find him,
we won't have time to visit

14:26.658 --> 14:29.744
until we see them in Florida
in a few months.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're gonna...
We're gonna find him.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.998
All right. Everybody spread out.
Search the area.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.250
Meet back here in ten minutes.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.502
Okay, I'm gonna
look for a trail of skin flakes

14:37.585 --> 14:38.670
and grandpa droppings.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.149
Hi.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.442
You folks again, huh?

15:00.525 --> 15:03.695
So, uh, we lost her father now.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.364
Bob lost him.
That's Bob, right there.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.283
All right.
Well, how can I help you this time?

15:08.366 --> 15:10.660
-Can you page him?
-Sure, I can page him, yeah.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.829
Uh, it's gonna have to be really loud.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.622
And for, like, the next hour.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.167
-Over and over again.
-Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.169
We do have security cameras, though.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.628
I'll bring you guys over to TSA.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.880
They're in charge of camera stuff,

15:21.963 --> 15:23.631
and then you can be their problem.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.760
-(cracks knuckles)
-Okay, let's see what happened to Gramps.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.053
Find out who took him.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.929
Oh, not took him.
Not took him.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.181
Eh, we'll find out.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.141
So, here we see

15:33.224 --> 15:36.019
-the two of you sitting together.
-Uh, yep, that's us.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.562
TSA AGENT:
Wow, he's hanging on
your every word, huh?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.563
BOB:
Uh, yeah.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.939
TSA AGENT:
Okay, now, what is that?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.108
-What are you doing?
-BOB: Oh, my leg fell asleep,

15:42.192 --> 15:43.735
so I was, uh, uh, pinching it.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.279
But then I hurt my hand
and I had to shake it out.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.365
You hurt your hand pinching yourself?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.325
-Ye-Yeah.
-But in a cool way.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.701
Is there any way

15:51.785 --> 15:53.828
-we can get a copy of this tape?
-Louise.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.664
TSA AGENT:
Okay, now it looks like
you're staring at the TV,

15:56.748 --> 15:58.500
barely looking at your father-in-law.

15:58.583 --> 16:02.045
Uh-huh.
But that's still kind of visiting, right?

16:02.128 --> 16:05.131
Ugh. Let's just find him,
Mr. Sports Talk Sleepy Legs.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.051
TSA AGENT:
Here's where your father-in-law
wakes up and walks off.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.844
(gasps):
Can we follow him?

16:09.928 --> 16:12.097
Can we-can we look at the footage
from other cameras?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.765
Well, let's cycle through
some of the live feeds

16:13.848 --> 16:14.933
and see what we see.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.143
-Let's T.S. this A.
-This guy.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.603
TSA AGENT:
No. No.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.563
-Whoa!
-ALL: Aah!
-Oh, his face!

16:20.647 --> 16:22.941
Al?
Al, answer me!

16:23.024 --> 16:25.276
Quick! Can you radio someone
to tackle him? Gently?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.320
-Yeah! A tickle tackle!
-Take the shot.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.947
-Take the shot!
-Where is that?

16:29.030 --> 16:31.574
-How do we get there?
-Too bad none of us have access

16:31.658 --> 16:33.410
to an electric cart that we're allowed to,

16:33.493 --> 16:35.120
I don't know, drive around inside.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.455
Oh, wait. <i>I </i>do.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.792
This is way better than running.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.419
And flying. I assume.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.670
Get out of the way!

16:43.753 --> 16:45.296
We're hunting the most dangerous game!

16:45.380 --> 16:47.048
-My bag!
-BOB: I'll get it.

16:47.132 --> 16:50.010
Sorry, ma'am.
We pulled some serious Gs on that turn.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.012
Wait. Is this a phone charger?

16:52.095 --> 16:53.805
Ha! See, Linda? Aha.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.056
Aha!

16:55.140 --> 16:57.392
-What's his problem?
-It's so weird, Gloria.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.311
Linda used to have a charger
just like this.

17:00.395 --> 17:03.189
It even had a drawing of a butt
on it that Gene did.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.233
Like this.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.277
It's my commentary on technology.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.154
-Bob.
-You're talking crazy, Bob.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.448
This isn't your charger.
Admit it.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.324
No. I'm not admitting anything.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.827
'Cause it <i>is </i>my charger.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.120
Did you draw a butt on it?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.831
I'm gonna go look for Al by myself,

17:19.914 --> 17:22.834
-over there.
-Oh, great job, Bob. Super.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.586
You saw it, Linda.
You saw the butt.

17:24.669 --> 17:25.920
We all saw the butt.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.464
-I saw the butt.
-I saw the butt.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.257
I saw the butt.
Should we start a club?

17:29.341 --> 17:32.469
Ooh, Butt Club.
Wait, no. Butt Society.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.391
So you promised
<i>not </i>to bring up the charger,

17:38.475 --> 17:39.934
but then... you did.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.269
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.313
She won't come out, Bob.
And my father's

17:43.396 --> 17:44.731
still wandering around somewhere

17:44.814 --> 17:46.358
getting itch cream all over the place.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.027
This is a really great family
visit. I hope you're happy.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.279
Oh, my God, the mother lode.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.781
Parents, we'll be right back.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.033
Yoo-hoo! Pilots!

17:55.116 --> 17:57.160
Lin, uh, I-I'm sorry.
I just wanted your mom

17:57.243 --> 17:59.329
-to admit the truth.
-We had a deal, Bob.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.331
You weren't gonna bring up the charger.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.667
I just don't get why you don't
ever confront them about stuff.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.502
'Cause it doesn't make a difference.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.463
At the end of the day, you know,
they're doing the best they can.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.674
-Uh, which is bad.
-Yeah, sometimes it's not great,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.926
but get over it--
it's just a dumb phone charger.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.719
Yeah, Bob.
It's just a phone charger.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.179
It's not about the phone charger,

18:16.262 --> 18:18.348
and it's not about
the bad Christmas gift to the kids.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.809
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
The Christmas gift for the kids?

18:20.892 --> 18:23.269
-I don't know about this.
-I'll tell you in a second.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.690
Anyway, what bothers me is that
none of this stuff bothers you.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.692
So you're bothered
because I'm not bothered?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.736
Yes. It-it should bother you
when you have to drop everything

18:31.820 --> 18:33.905
to bring them itch cream an hour away.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.949
Wait. Itch cream?
They sell itch cream here.

18:36.032 --> 18:39.119
-Oh, my God.
-Look, Bob, it doesn't bother me
to do things for my parents.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.121
It should.
Lin, I see how hard you try

18:41.204 --> 18:42.956
and how little they appreciate it,

18:43.039 --> 18:44.791
and they never admit when they're wrong,

18:44.874 --> 18:47.085
and it drives me nuts,
because you're, like,

18:47.168 --> 18:50.380
-the best daughter in the world.
-Aw, Bobby. That's sweet.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.382
-It really is, Bobby.
-Thank you.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.467
But I put up with them
because I love them.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.220
And since you love me,
I need you to do that, too.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.140
So you're saying the way
to show you I love you

19:00.223 --> 19:02.726
is just to quietly
let your parents be crappy?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.853
-Kinda.
-(sighs)

19:04.936 --> 19:06.604
Uh, okay, I can do that.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.773
-Mwah!
-LOUISE: So, it turns out pilots

19:08.857 --> 19:11.568
do not have to give you wings,
even when you say it's an order.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.445
-You guys like stickers?
-No.
-Sure.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.488
-I'll take a sticker.
-Sorry, I don't have stickers.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.907
I just know that kids like stickers.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.410
I'm glad you apologized, Bob.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.746
Because you were so wrong
about the charger.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.790
I told everyone in the bathroom about it.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.208
I'm sure you did.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.878
-And you lost Al!
-That is true.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.339
He basically just said
one thing to me, and then he...

19:32.422 --> 19:35.133
Wait a second.
I think I know where he is.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.302
LINDA:
Dad! There you are!

19:37.385 --> 19:38.720
Yay! We found Grandpa Al.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.555
-He's breathing, right?
-(snoring)

19:40.638 --> 19:42.140
Yeah, he's breathing.
We're good.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.642
Hey, Al said something
about his neck, and I heard it,

19:44.726 --> 19:46.770
which means we had a good talk.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.147
I-I-I'm a good son-in-law!

19:49.230 --> 19:51.399
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Calm down.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.318
-This is a crazy first day.
-What?

19:53.401 --> 19:55.070
<i>MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i>Attention all passengers--</i>

19:55.153 --> 19:58.948
<i>this is final boarding</i>
<i>for Flight 2128 to Fort Lauderdale.</i>

19:59.032 --> 20:00.492
That's our flight!

20:00.575 --> 20:02.702
Al? Al!

20:02.786 --> 20:05.538
Go, go, go!
But take off your shoes. But go!

20:05.622 --> 20:08.208
My back...
I-I can't take off my shoes!

20:08.291 --> 20:10.377
All right, just leave 'em on.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.129
-But you're gonna have
to throw away that itch cream.
-Okay.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.216
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, okay, everyone, say bye! Quick bye!

20:16.299 --> 20:19.427
-Come on. Bye!
-Bye! Bye! Bye!

20:19.511 --> 20:20.970
Bye. I love you.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.181
-Great visit.
-Listen, if you want, Lin,

20:23.264 --> 20:25.392
we can go to Florida in the spring.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.937
-Oh, no. No way. This counts. This counts.
-Oh, thank God.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.856
Wait, I know where I've seen wings.
Follow me!

20:31.940 --> 20:34.651
The lost and found, baby!

20:34.734 --> 20:36.653
Look, Bob! A snow globe!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.738
Oh, uh, hey, Mr. TSA Man,

20:38.822 --> 20:41.199
could we maybe take that
for our friend Teddy?

20:41.282 --> 20:43.576
I mean, I was gonna
give it to my girlfriend,

20:43.660 --> 20:45.870
when I get a girlfriend,
but I can figure something else out.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.414
-You can take it.
-Thank you.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.499
Kids, here's what I wanted to show you.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.794
Look at them all.
It's like a whole flock.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.296
Eat your heart out, Paul McCartney!
We've got wings!

20:55.380 --> 20:57.173
Mine, mine, mine! All mine!

20:57.257 --> 20:58.842
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

21:31.958 --> 21:33.918
