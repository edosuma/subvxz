00:34.208 --> 00:37.500
-Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.291
<i>What's great about</i>
<i>having an older brother</i>

00:56.375 --> 00:57.958
<i>is that they can teach you stuff,</i>

00:58.041 --> 01:00.166
<i>because they've gone through</i>
<i>all of it before you.</i>

01:01.166 --> 01:03.208
<i>At least that's the way</i>
<i>it's supposed to be.</i>

01:04.291 --> 01:07.250
<i>But my brother Rodrick's too busy</i>
<i>to teach his little brother anything.</i>

01:09.708 --> 01:11.875
<i>I guess</i>
<i>I'm just not a big priority for him</i>

01:12.708 --> 01:15.208
<i>because all his free time</i>
<i>just goes to his band.</i>

01:17.625 --> 01:20.750
<i>The thing is, if Rodrick</i>
<i>would just take me under his wing,</i>

01:20.833 --> 01:22.666
<i>I could totally surprise him.</i>

01:22.750 --> 01:24.875
<i>And that would really change things</i>
<i>for us.</i>

01:28.833 --> 01:31.416
<i>But I guess that's just not gonna happen.</i>

01:31.500 --> 01:33.416
<i>And before long, Rodrick will move out,</i>

01:33.500 --> 01:35.708
<i>and I'll have to figure things out</i>
<i>for myself.</i>

01:39.750 --> 01:42.625
<i>But as long as the two of us are</i>
<i>living under the same roof,</i>

01:42.708 --> 01:45.833
<i>I'm gonna soak up every bit</i>
<i>of big brother knowledge I can get.</i>

01:56.916 --> 02:01.000
<i>Player has received</i>
<i>Hammer of Ultimate Smashing!</i>

02:01.541 --> 02:04.541
<i>Smash, smash…</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:08.583
Ooh. Ready, aim, fire!

02:08.666 --> 02:09.666
Manny!

02:09.750 --> 02:10.833
Aw.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.416
Boys, the stuff in the dishwasher
is clean.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.041
You just need to put the dishes away
before we get back.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.125
Okay, yeah.
I got your hair dryer and my belt.

02:18.208 --> 02:20.541
Um, was that-- Was--
Am I forgetting something?

02:21.250 --> 02:22.666
Your pants?

02:22.750 --> 02:25.333
Right. My pants.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.041
Wait. Where are you guys going again?

02:29.166 --> 02:32.291
Your father and I are going
into the city for our anniversary.

02:32.375 --> 02:35.708
You're going away? Like, overnight?

02:35.791 --> 02:37.250
Two nights, Greg.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.041
Come on, Greg.
We've been over this a hundred times.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.333
But-- But how are we gonna
take care of ourselves?

02:42.416 --> 02:43.875
What about Manny?

02:43.958 --> 02:46.375
-Manny's staying with Gramma.
-Hey!

02:46.458 --> 02:51.250
And you boys will be just fine.
I stocked up on groceries.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.541
-Groceries?

02:52.625 --> 02:53.750
Did you get snacks?

02:53.833 --> 02:55.625
-I refuse to buy junk food for you guys.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.208
I've told you before, if you want snacks,
you can buy them for yourselves.

02:59.291 --> 03:00.458
Mommy, gimme!

03:00.541 --> 03:02.041
Ugh, fine.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.625
-I'm cashing these in.

03:05.708 --> 03:09.250
250 Mom Bucks for 25 real ones.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.500
"Mom Bucks"?

03:13.833 --> 03:16.458
Oh. Yes, Frank.

03:16.541 --> 03:19.708
The boys earn them by doing chores
and getting good grades.

03:19.791 --> 03:22.583
Wait. Then how did Rodrick get so many?

03:22.666 --> 03:24.125
Mind your own business.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.750
-Yuck.
-Rodrick should be earning real money,

03:27.833 --> 03:30.958
not play money with, you know,
like, a real job.

03:31.041 --> 03:33.916
When Löded Diper makes it big,
money won't be an issue.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.333
Okay. And what if, just saying,
just putting it out there,

03:37.416 --> 03:40.500
what if your band doesn't make it big?
What's your plan then?

03:43.125 --> 03:46.750
I'll sell my hair for wigs
and fake mustaches and stuff.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.083
Well, that sounds foolproof.

03:51.500 --> 03:55.041
Okay, time to go!
We've got dinner reservations.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.916
-See you boys Sunday!
-Whoo!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.375
Mom!

03:58.458 --> 04:01.583
Now, we are trusting you
to be responsible this weekend.

04:01.666 --> 04:03.916
I don't want you doing anything
I wouldn't do. Got it?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.166
Frank, we talked about this.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.958
I-I just wanted to make sure
we're all on the same page.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.041
We good here?

04:11.541 --> 04:14.541
Okay? Okay, we're good.

04:14.625 --> 04:17.625
You can't leave me and Rodrick alone
together for a whole weekend.

04:17.708 --> 04:20.291
Mom, we literally don't even know
how to take care of ourselves!

04:20.375 --> 04:23.750
-Oh, come on, Greg. You two will have fun.

04:25.083 --> 04:28.583
Play some video games together.
Throw a ball in the backyard.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.625
Do you even know Rodrick?

04:32.625 --> 04:36.166
Listen, I know that you and your brother
don't always get along,

04:36.250 --> 04:38.333
but a weekend like this
can help change that.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.500
-Yeah!
-Ow!

04:43.250 --> 04:45.833
Who knows?
You two might surprise yourselves.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.875
Don't forget to unload the dishwasher!

04:54.625 --> 04:56.041
-Whoa!
-All right, Greg.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.791
We've got one hour
to get this place ready.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.125
Ready for what?

04:59.833 --> 05:00.916
The party.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.250
What? No way! Mom and Dad
would never let you have a party!

05:05.333 --> 05:08.666
They'll never even know,
and it's not my party anyway.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.750
It's our party.

05:10.833 --> 05:13.250
Whoa. What do you mean "our party"?

05:13.333 --> 05:17.041
The Heffley brothers
are throwing this party together.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.833
The Heffley brothers?

05:19.375 --> 05:23.916
That's right. You and me, together.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.875
People will be talking about this night
for years.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.666
It's gonna be epic.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.041
Epic.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.916
So, what do you say? Are you in?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.500
Okay, I'm in.

05:39.583 --> 05:42.208
But who's coming to this thing?

05:42.291 --> 05:44.458
I invite my friends. You invite yours.

05:45.208 --> 05:48.083
W-Wait. Y-You do have friends, right?

05:48.166 --> 05:54.625
Yeah, I have lots of friends!
There's Rowley, and there's Rowley.

05:54.708 --> 05:57.125
Well, then,
why don't you call this "Rowley"

05:57.208 --> 05:58.916
and have him come over to help set up?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.958
I don't know. I'm not sure Rowley
could really handle a high school party.

06:03.041 --> 06:05.250
Plus, his parents
would never let him come.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.125
So, you have him
tell them it's a sleepover.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.625
Come on, we need all the help we can get.

06:09.708 --> 06:12.166
Oh. That's pretty good.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.708
And when he gets here, you guys can start
by bringing up one of those plastic tables

06:15.791 --> 06:16.791
from the basement.

06:16.875 --> 06:20.083
Wait. Why can't you do that?

06:20.166 --> 06:22.666
Because…

06:22.750 --> 06:25.291
I can't do this without your help.

06:25.958 --> 06:29.000
And besides, I'm going to get snacks.

06:29.541 --> 06:32.416
Whoa! How do you have so many friends?

06:32.500 --> 06:35.791
It's called popularity. You should try it.

06:36.625 --> 06:40.875
All right. The clock starts… now.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.250
Now.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.458
-Whoa! Party at Rodrick's, dude!

07:02.541 --> 07:04.250
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

07:05.333 --> 07:08.166
-…totally got their nose rings locked.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.166
Whoa! Rager at Rodrick's!

07:10.250 --> 07:11.625
-Yes!
-It's gonna be awesome!

07:11.708 --> 07:12.750
-Whoa!

07:14.458 --> 07:15.458
Party!

07:22.958 --> 07:25.958
Hey, Greg! It's party time!

07:26.041 --> 07:29.458
No, no, no!

07:30.791 --> 07:33.666
Whoa! Rowley, what are you wearing?

07:34.250 --> 07:35.875
You said this was a party.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.291
Not that kind of party.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.500
A cool party with, like, high schoolers,
and loud music and stuff.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.416
You mean a boy-girl party?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.916
Rowley, don't call it a boy-girl party.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.041
Why? Is it gonna be guys only?
'Cause that could be fun too.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.000
No, just call it a party, okay?

07:57.083 --> 08:00.375
And seriously, don't embarrass me tonight.

08:01.125 --> 08:04.666
It's just that
me and Rodrick never team up like this,

08:04.750 --> 08:06.916
and I really don't want anything
to mess it up.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.041
-Okay?
-Okay.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.041
All right.
You boys got your work cut out for ya.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.166
Get to it.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.333
Ugh.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.333
Go! Go, go, go, go!

09:18.833 --> 09:20.333
-Ow!

09:20.416 --> 09:23.250
Hmm. Good job, guys.

09:23.833 --> 09:29.458
Huh. You know what, though?
We could use one more of those tables.

09:30.750 --> 09:31.750
We're on it.

09:34.458 --> 09:38.208
Do we have to do this?
The first table was heavy.

09:38.291 --> 09:43.041
Everything's gotta be perfect!
Rodrick's, like, an expert at this stuff.

09:43.125 --> 09:47.458
But it seems like he's just getting us
to do all the hard stuff.

09:47.541 --> 09:51.250
You don't get it, Rowley.
Rodrick's depending on me.

09:51.333 --> 09:54.333
Our party's gonna be… epic.

10:05.791 --> 10:07.833
Um.

10:22.458 --> 10:23.791
Whoa.

10:30.541 --> 10:32.666
I don't think
we should be in Rodrick's bedroom.

10:32.750 --> 10:35.625
Relax, we're just in here for the table.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.916
Do you think
there will be party games,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.375
like charades
or pin the tail on the donkey?

10:45.833 --> 10:47.708
It's not that kind of thing, Rowley.

10:47.791 --> 10:50.791
High-school parties are totally different
than little-kid parties.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.041
How do you know?

10:52.125 --> 10:54.291
I just know stuff.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.833
Listen, we're gonna be
the only middle schoolers at this thing.

10:56.916 --> 11:00.333
We've gotta blend in.
Just try and be cool, okay?

11:00.416 --> 11:03.458
But pin the tail on the donkey is cool.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.625
Wait, what?

11:11.916 --> 11:15.625
"See you after the party."

11:16.583 --> 11:17.583
Oh, no.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.208
What's going on? Is it stuck?

11:20.291 --> 11:23.500
It's not stuck!
I think Rodrick locked the door.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.666
But why would he do that?

11:25.750 --> 11:28.291
What about the party?
What about the Heffley brothers?

11:29.875 --> 11:32.583
It was, uh, probably just a joke.

11:32.666 --> 11:36.875
Rodrick? Rodrick!

11:39.250 --> 11:40.250
Rodrick!

11:42.458 --> 11:43.708
Rodrick!

11:45.541 --> 11:46.625
Rodrick!

12:00.625 --> 12:01.625
Rodrick!

12:02.416 --> 12:03.416
Is he coming?

12:03.500 --> 12:04.625
Just wait here, okay?

12:07.041 --> 12:09.166
But I have tap-dancing lessons
in the morning.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.375
I was sick last week,

12:10.458 --> 12:14.583
and if I miss two in a row,
Miss Tilly's gonna be mad.

12:14.666 --> 12:17.166
Relax, Rowley.
I've got everything under control.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.041
Hmm.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.916
I'm scared. What if we starve down here?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.958
-My celery sticks are in my overnight bag.

12:28.041 --> 12:31.416
Can you please stop talking
for five seconds? I need to concentrate.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.458
What's going on out there?
Are they… partying?

12:43.416 --> 12:47.000
I think I can reach the lock.

12:48.416 --> 12:49.583
Ow!

12:53.666 --> 12:55.000
Can you reach it?

12:55.083 --> 12:56.083
No.

12:56.166 --> 12:59.833
But I've got an idea. Wait here.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.000
Let's get this party started!

13:07.583 --> 13:09.916
-Whoo!
-Nice brain bucket.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.583
And I was like,
"Underwear goes under your pants, bro."

13:13.666 --> 13:14.500
Ew!

13:19.458 --> 13:20.625
Whoa.

13:22.416 --> 13:23.708
-Whoa.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.625
Move.

13:30.625 --> 13:31.666
What's that for?

13:33.708 --> 13:34.958
Evidence.

13:36.166 --> 13:37.791
Whoa.

13:38.958 --> 13:42.750
-Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

13:43.708 --> 13:44.875
He actually did it!

13:44.958 --> 13:46.416
Yeah!

13:46.500 --> 13:47.833
Whoa!

13:48.750 --> 13:50.333
Huh? What--

14:04.541 --> 14:05.541
Whoa!

14:05.625 --> 14:06.625
-Ow!

14:07.250 --> 14:08.250
What?

14:08.333 --> 14:09.416
-Ew!

14:11.583 --> 14:13.916
I think I'd better go home.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.291
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.666
Dude.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.125
Not cool, dude.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.166
-Not cool.

15:03.708 --> 15:05.458
-My head.

15:05.541 --> 15:07.458
-This sucks.
-Not cool.

15:15.375 --> 15:19.125
What's your problem, man?

15:19.666 --> 15:22.750
It's not even, like, afternoon yet.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.125
You locked me in the basement!

15:25.208 --> 15:28.583
Yeah, like, as a joke.

15:28.666 --> 15:33.875
Well, the joke's on you, because
when Mom and Dad get home tomorrow,

15:33.958 --> 15:36.375
I'm gonna tell them
all about your little party.

15:39.708 --> 15:41.833
You wouldn't have the guts.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.083
Hey, Mom. How is the trip going?

15:48.166 --> 15:51.833
Well-- Well, it was going great
until Manny got a stomach bug.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.541
We're headed to Gramma's to pick him up.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.125
Wait. You're coming home today?

15:56.208 --> 15:57.333
-Yes, Rodrick.
-Got it.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.916
We should be home in an hour.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.583
Did you boys empty the dishwasher
like I asked?

16:01.666 --> 16:02.833
You gotta be kidding me.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.625
Not yet.

16:06.708 --> 16:09.416
<i>Well, it had better be done</i>
<i>by the time we're back.</i>

16:09.500 --> 16:12.041
No problem. See you soon.

16:13.208 --> 16:18.500
Okay, you heard her. We've got one hour
to clean up this whole mess.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.333
Not my problem. I'll be in my room.

16:25.833 --> 16:26.833
Dude!

16:26.916 --> 16:31.083
Mom and Dad are gonna go ballistic
if they find out I had a party!

16:31.166 --> 16:33.250
Please, you've gotta help me.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.500
And why would I do that?

16:38.791 --> 16:39.875
Because we're brothers.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.500
Yeah, well, brothers don't lock each other
in the basement.

16:43.583 --> 16:48.208
Okay, okay. I slipped up.
Won't happen again, I swear.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.958
Please!

16:51.833 --> 16:56.041
If I help you clean up this mess,
things are gonna be different between us.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.375
Different? Like how?

16:58.458 --> 17:02.625
For starters, you're gonna start
treating me better, like an equal.

17:02.708 --> 17:06.208
Okay, okay. Done. Equals. Got it.

17:06.791 --> 17:08.083
And you're gonna owe me.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.916
Owe you what?

17:10.500 --> 17:11.750
I'm-- I'm-- I'm thinking.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.875
Dude, we've got no time!

17:16.166 --> 17:20.666
Okay. Yeah, I owe you.
Can we just work out the details later?

17:20.750 --> 17:22.250
Fine.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.916
All right, my man! Let's do this.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.000
And go!

17:37.083 --> 17:38.625
-What?
-Hmm.

17:39.416 --> 17:40.791
-Hmm.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.291
Gonna blow chunks!

17:43.375 --> 17:45.708
Don't worry, Manny.
We'll be home in a jiffy.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.625
Honey, better step on it.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.916
-Whoa!

17:59.750 --> 18:01.166
I am taking the shortcut!

18:03.333 --> 18:05.083
Whoa!

18:08.375 --> 18:09.541
Manny!

18:14.666 --> 18:16.166
Huh? What?

18:16.250 --> 18:18.041
Whoa!

18:19.916 --> 18:21.166
Ouch!

18:38.208 --> 18:40.375
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.333
Mission accomplished, little bro.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.583
It's permanent ink!
This is never coming off!

19:28.666 --> 19:29.666
Um--

19:29.750 --> 19:31.166
We need another door!

19:31.250 --> 19:34.375
Another door?
Where are we gonna get another door?

19:34.458 --> 19:37.416
The basement!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

19:49.666 --> 19:51.625
Oh, let's hurry up and get you inside.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.375
Quit pushing!

19:55.458 --> 19:57.458
Quit pulling! Push!

19:57.541 --> 19:58.750
I said pull!

19:58.833 --> 19:59.833
Ow!

20:02.291 --> 20:03.708
Come on, Frank.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.458
Boys?

20:18.541 --> 20:19.708
We're home!

20:19.791 --> 20:21.583
Oh. Hey, Mom!

20:22.666 --> 20:26.083
So, did you guys do some brotherly bonding
while we were gone?

20:26.166 --> 20:27.916
Uh, kinda, I guess.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.666
Rodrick, y-you're sweating!

20:31.291 --> 20:33.958
Oh, I hope you don't have what Manny has.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.458
I knew it, Susan!

20:35.958 --> 20:38.166
I knew they couldn't be trusted!

20:38.250 --> 20:40.041
They didn't empty the dishwasher.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.916
-Oh, that's gross.
-Manny all better!

20:59.500 --> 21:01.583
Oh.

21:01.666 --> 21:03.166
Oh, man!

21:05.333 --> 21:06.458
Hmm.

21:06.958 --> 21:12.125
There's gotta be evidence.
They're not that smart.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.291
Aha!

21:31.291 --> 21:33.916
You think he knows? I-- I think he knows!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.416
Shh! Keep your voice down, dummy.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.000
If he doesn't know,
he's gonna figure it out.

21:39.083 --> 21:42.166
I mean, he's been sniffing around
the house ever since he got back.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.916
He's gonna find something.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.625
You need to calm down. We covered
our tracks. We cleaned up the place.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.500
Yeah, and you owe me for that.

21:50.583 --> 21:53.583
And you can start paying me back
by finishing with these leaves!

21:53.666 --> 21:57.041
Wait, wait, wait.
What-- What is this about owing you?

21:57.125 --> 21:59.583
I don't remember saying
anything like that.

22:00.583 --> 22:04.666
Are you kidding me? I cleaned up
your stupid party, and that wasn't easy!

22:04.750 --> 22:09.708
Don't you mean our party?
We were partners in this thing.

22:09.791 --> 22:11.958
That mess was our mess,

22:12.041 --> 22:15.916
and if Mom and Dad ever find out about it,
we're both in hot water.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.500
No way! This was your party!

22:18.583 --> 22:21.041
You're the one who's getting in trouble,
not me!

22:21.125 --> 22:23.666
I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad
what really happened.

22:26.750 --> 22:30.791
Fine, fine. I'll pay up.

22:31.625 --> 22:33.708
Yeah? And how are you gonna do that?

22:34.416 --> 22:38.500
By giving you my most valuable possession.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.625
What? Mom Bucks?

22:40.708 --> 22:43.333
No, thanks. I've seen where you keep them.

22:43.416 --> 22:48.000
Something even better than that.
Knowledge.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.000
I've seen your report card.

22:50.083 --> 22:55.625
Not school knowledge. Real knowledge.
Stuff you can actually use.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.958
I'm listening.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.000
I'll give you a little taste.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.250
Let's start with the way
you bag your leaves.

23:01.333 --> 23:05.166
When you do it, you fill your bag
to the top and then tie it shut.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.041
But that's not smart.

23:07.125 --> 23:09.708
Mom's paying three Mom Bucks a bag.

23:09.791 --> 23:13.875
So, if you wanna maximize your income,
you've gotta do it like this.

23:17.916 --> 23:20.083
But isn't that cheating?

23:20.166 --> 23:23.166
It's not cheating.
It's just gaming the system.

23:23.875 --> 23:26.541
So, what? You're just gonna give me
a bunch of yard work tips?

23:26.625 --> 23:28.916
I can teach you lots of things,
little brother.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.166
Stuff that'll make your whole life easier.

23:32.250 --> 23:34.625
Your problem is that you work too hard.

23:34.708 --> 23:37.500
I want that underwear off the table

23:37.583 --> 23:39.833
by the time I get back
from the grocery store.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.791
-<i>What you do is set the bar low,</i>

23:42.875 --> 23:45.000
<i>so Mom and Dad don't expect</i>
<i>too much out of you.</i>

23:45.500 --> 23:46.833
<i>Because then…</i>

23:48.375 --> 23:49.375
Wha--

23:49.458 --> 23:52.541
<i>…they're happy</i>
<i>when you do practically nothing at all.</i>

23:52.625 --> 23:53.625
<i>Here's another tip.</i>

23:54.208 --> 23:56.000
<i>Pretend you don't know how to do stuff,</i>

23:56.083 --> 23:58.708
<i>because that'll get you out of</i>
<i>a lot of unnecessary work.</i>

23:58.791 --> 24:00.916
H…

24:01.750 --> 24:04.333
H… Hmm.

24:05.375 --> 24:06.875
I'll just do it, okay?

24:09.666 --> 24:12.500
<i>And if you really</i>
<i>don't feel like doing something,</i>

24:12.583 --> 24:15.541
<i>a well-timed trip to the bathroom</i>
<i>is always your ticket out.</i>

24:15.625 --> 24:16.958
I'm ready to start!

24:17.041 --> 24:18.541
I just finished.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.208
My body is on a schedule.

24:23.958 --> 24:27.125
Okay, I'll admit it. That's--
That's pretty good.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.333
What else can you teach me?

24:28.416 --> 24:33.125
Oh, I've got loads of stuff like that.
I call it my Rodrick Rules.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.791
Don't you mean "Rodrick's Rules"?

24:36.875 --> 24:41.791
No, Rodrick Rules.
There's only one Rodrick, me.

24:41.875 --> 24:42.750
Yeah.

24:42.833 --> 24:45.291
I meant, like, apostrophe S.

24:45.375 --> 24:49.375
Rodrick Rule number one.
No apostrophes or any other nerd stuff.

24:50.416 --> 24:53.041
That kinda stuff will get you beat up
at school.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.583
So, what's rule number two?

24:54.666 --> 24:57.541
Uh, I've already given away too much.

24:57.625 --> 25:01.625
If you want more, we're gonna have to
make this deal official.

25:02.125 --> 25:07.333
You keep your mouth shut about the party,
and I'll tell you everything I know.

25:08.458 --> 25:09.458
Deal.

25:23.875 --> 25:27.291
Greg, Rowley's here! Time to go!

25:28.458 --> 25:32.250
Hello, Rowley. Don't you look handsome?

25:33.416 --> 25:39.041
Um, this weekend I had tap-dancing lessons
with Miss Tilly.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.833
Uh, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.500
-Whoa. Hey, Rowley!

25:48.583 --> 25:51.791
It's been a while.
Friday afternoon, right?

25:51.875 --> 25:52.916
Yeah, we--

25:53.416 --> 25:57.333
-Whoa! So clean.
-Uh…

25:57.416 --> 26:00.708
Yeah, yeah. Time to go, Rowley!
Time-- Time to go. Get out.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.666
Come on, Rowley.
Two more seconds in there,

26:04.750 --> 26:06.958
and you were gonna spill your guts
about the whole party.

26:07.041 --> 26:10.333
Sorry, I'm not good at this stuff.

26:10.416 --> 26:12.833
You don't think my dad heard you
back there, right?

26:12.916 --> 26:15.416
'Cause he's been acting really suspicious.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.833
How did you get the house so clean,
though?

26:18.333 --> 26:21.416
Um, me and Rodrick
actually did it together.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.375
I told you, me and him are a team.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.791
You and Rodrick?
But he locked us in the basement!

26:26.875 --> 26:30.458
Uh, yeah.
Brothers just joke like that.

26:30.541 --> 26:33.291
It's actually pretty hilarious
if you really think about it.

26:34.708 --> 26:35.958
Don't look at me like that.

26:36.875 --> 26:40.000
Anyway, yeah, Rodrick's been, uh--
He's been taking me under his wing.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.958
He's been teaching me a bunch of stuff.

26:42.458 --> 26:44.500
Really? What kind of stuff?

26:44.583 --> 26:47.000
Uh, like, how you need to set the bar low,

26:47.083 --> 26:49.041
so your parents don't expect
too much from you.

26:49.125 --> 26:52.250
Oh, and how you can trick them
into helping you with your homework.

26:52.333 --> 26:53.625
That kind of thing.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.750
That seems like bad stuff.

26:56.833 --> 26:59.083
This information is like gold, Rowley!

26:59.166 --> 27:01.291
It's what makes having an older brother
worth it.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.208
But why is Rodrick being so nice to you
all of a sudden?

27:08.375 --> 27:11.666
I don't know. Maybe 'cause he just likes
having me around.

27:11.750 --> 27:14.666
You know what? You wouldn't understand.
You're an only child.

27:14.750 --> 27:15.750
No offense.

27:16.416 --> 27:23.166
Well, I'm glad I'm an only child.
'Cause this brother stuff is complicated.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.000
Rodrick!

27:57.291 --> 27:58.583
Rodrick!

28:00.041 --> 28:01.333
Rodrick!

28:05.125 --> 28:06.375
What?

28:06.458 --> 28:10.875
You need to teach me something new.
You never got past rule number one.

28:10.958 --> 28:14.250
You only get one rule a week.
That's Rodrick Rule number two.

28:15.750 --> 28:18.333
What? That's not fair.

28:18.416 --> 28:19.833
Life's not fair.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.583
Rule number three.
And now you made me break rule number two.

28:24.666 --> 28:26.458
Fine.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.250
Ow! What the--

28:29.333 --> 28:31.250
I've been looking for that.

28:31.333 --> 28:32.333
What is this?

28:32.416 --> 28:34.458
It's an echo pedal. We need it…

28:34.541 --> 28:37.458
…for the talent show.

28:37.541 --> 28:41.375
Oh, yeah, the talent show.
I'm trying out too.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.541
You? You don't have any talent.

28:45.833 --> 28:48.750
Yeah, I'm in Rowley's magic act.

28:48.833 --> 28:50.416
<i>I'm his…</i>

28:50.500 --> 28:51.583
<i>assistant.</i>

28:54.958 --> 28:59.041
Man, they're--
they're gonna laugh you off the stage.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.125
Yeah, I know. Mom's making me.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.208
Hey, do you think
you can get me out of this?

29:05.291 --> 29:08.958
Sorry, you c--
You can't leave your friends hanging.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.208
Rodrick Rule number four.

29:10.291 --> 29:14.125
All right, enough with the rules.
How about you teach me something for real?

29:14.208 --> 29:15.416
Like what?

29:15.500 --> 29:16.833
I don't know.

29:17.625 --> 29:21.666
Maybe you could teach me
how to play the drums or something.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.375
Are you sure
you could handle that, little brother?

29:28.416 --> 29:29.833
-Yeah!
-All right.

29:30.541 --> 29:31.541
It's simple.

29:31.625 --> 29:37.708
You just gotta grip the sticks,
feel the flow, and let it rip.

29:41.041 --> 29:46.708
Okay, now loosen up that wrist a bit.
Keep it flowing. Feel the rhythm.

29:46.791 --> 29:50.916
That-- Th-That's it!
You've got potential, little bro.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.833
Are you ready to rock?

29:57.708 --> 30:00.333
<i>Bill Walter</i>
<i>is the lead singer of Löded Diper,</i>

30:00.416 --> 30:03.208
<i>even though</i>
<i>he's something like 35 years old.</i>

30:03.291 --> 30:05.375
<i>I'm pretty sure Rodrick asked him to join</i>

30:05.458 --> 30:08.250
<i>because he got named</i>
<i>"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star"</i>

30:08.333 --> 30:10.416
<i>when he was in high school.</i>

30:13.125 --> 30:15.708
Beat it, kid. Grown-ups are talking here.

30:17.458 --> 30:21.208
Nah, that-- That's all right.
He can stay. He's cool.

30:24.041 --> 30:25.708
Whatever you say, dude.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.875
You ready to burn this place down?

30:27.958 --> 30:29.875
We are Löded Diper!

30:29.958 --> 30:31.416
One, two, three, four!

30:41.833 --> 30:44.500
-Huh?

30:55.333 --> 30:58.166
Isn't setting the table Greg's job?

30:58.250 --> 31:00.541
He's hanging out with his brother
in the basement.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.666
I didn't want to interrupt
their "together time."

31:03.750 --> 31:05.708
Listen, I--

31:05.791 --> 31:09.458
Do you think it's a good idea that those
guys are spending so much time together?

31:09.541 --> 31:11.708
Why wouldn't it be a good idea?

31:13.833 --> 31:16.083
It's just that-- Well, I mean--

31:16.166 --> 31:19.625
Look, who knows what kind of stuff
Rodrick is teaching Greg?

31:19.708 --> 31:21.958
-Somebody farted!

31:23.500 --> 31:24.750
Ew, gross.

31:27.833 --> 31:30.416
-Somebody farted!

31:32.750 --> 31:34.333
I rest my case.

31:34.416 --> 31:36.708
The boys are bonding, Frank.

31:36.791 --> 31:38.958
Isn't that what we want to happen?

31:39.666 --> 31:44.125
Look, sometimes my older brother, Joe,
would string me along,

31:44.208 --> 31:45.750
and then I'd get burned.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.041
Greg needs to protect himself.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.791
Because if Rodrick pulls the rug out
from under him, he's gonna get hurt.

31:51.875 --> 31:55.625
We can't police every interaction
between these boys, Frank.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.875
They need to work things out on their own.

31:57.958 --> 32:01.416
Maybe you're right.
But I just-- I--

32:01.500 --> 32:04.666
Now why don't you just take off that tie,
and try and relax a little?

32:05.666 --> 32:09.083
I'll, uh, go get washed up for dinner.

32:17.500 --> 32:21.583
Hey! Didn't this door used to lock?

32:24.125 --> 32:25.250
So, you guys are telling us

32:25.333 --> 32:29.458
that you have no idea why
the bathroom door suddenly doesn't lock?

32:29.541 --> 32:33.375
Wait. We have a bathroom on this floor?

32:33.458 --> 32:38.458
I feel like there's something
the boys aren't telling us.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.833
Greg, would you like to say something?

32:43.625 --> 32:44.625
Um…

32:47.583 --> 32:51.333
Actually, something did happen
on Friday night.

32:51.916 --> 32:53.583
Something I should've told you about.

32:58.833 --> 33:01.541
I went in the bathroom,
and I tried to lock the door.

33:01.625 --> 33:02.625
But I couldn't.

33:03.666 --> 33:07.500
I think I must have broken it
by shutting it too hard or something.

33:07.583 --> 33:08.583
Sorry.

33:14.750 --> 33:18.375
Okay. Mystery solved. Let's move on.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Nice save.

33:20.666 --> 33:25.916
Boys, your father and I are taking another
shot at celebrating our anniversary

33:26.000 --> 33:28.333
since our first attempt got cut short.

33:28.416 --> 33:30.750
You're going away this weekend?

33:30.833 --> 33:32.666
Yes, but don't worry.

33:32.750 --> 33:34.958
You see, we're not gonna leave you two
on your own again.

33:35.041 --> 33:36.416
Why? Who's coming over?

33:37.500 --> 33:40.625
You two boys are gonna visit your grandpa.

33:40.708 --> 33:44.166
Wait. At Leisure Towers?
But there's nothing to do there.

33:44.250 --> 33:47.166
Oh, there's plenty to do
at Grandpa's complex.

33:47.250 --> 33:50.000
Shuffleboard, bingo, the pool.

33:50.083 --> 33:53.375
And you know how much
my dad loves board games!

33:54.250 --> 33:55.500
Board games?

33:55.583 --> 33:56.583
Come on, guys.

33:56.666 --> 34:00.000
You know Grandpa appreciates it
when you spend time with him.

34:00.083 --> 34:01.958
-But--
-Mom's right, Greg.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.500
It's been way too long
since we paid Grandpa a visit.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.708
This-- This is gonna be great.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.958
Okay, guys. Better get packed.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.291
Greg, I'll help you.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.583
-Rodrick?
-Yeah?

34:16.666 --> 34:18.000
Good role modeling.

34:18.625 --> 34:20.750
Well, I try.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.916
Ready, set, go!

34:31.000 --> 34:32.916
Whoo-hoo! Whee!

34:33.000 --> 34:35.250
-Aha!

34:37.250 --> 34:39.541
-Ooh. Hey!

34:42.000 --> 34:43.250
Dagnabbit!

34:44.416 --> 34:48.541
Okay, boys! This is Gutbusters!

34:48.625 --> 34:53.000
One player reads a card,
and the other players try not to laugh.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.208
Them's the rules!

34:54.291 --> 34:56.333
-That sounds so fun!

34:56.416 --> 34:58.416
-Roll the dice, Grandpa!

34:59.708 --> 35:01.875
Ha! Snake eyes!

35:01.958 --> 35:03.208
It's your turn to read, Greg.

35:03.291 --> 35:09.458
"A man who would pun,
would just as easily pick a pocket."

35:15.541 --> 35:17.000
Huh? I don't get it.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.458
Come on, Rodrick!

35:21.541 --> 35:23.208
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:23.291 --> 35:25.583
I'm sorry,
I-- I-- I-I-I couldn't help it.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.708
That one gets me every time.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.791
All right, boys.

35:29.875 --> 35:35.166
Now, why don't you clean up this mess
while I take a potty break?

35:35.250 --> 35:39.000
Okay, Grandpa.
But don't take too long in there.

35:40.875 --> 35:43.041
I can't believe you agreed to coming here.

35:43.125 --> 35:45.333
Why didn't you at least try
to get us out of it?

35:45.416 --> 35:49.041
Can't talk. Concentrating.

35:49.875 --> 35:51.916
Rodrick, what are you doing?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.583
Isn't one game enough?

35:55.125 --> 35:57.375
You think I'm here to play games?

35:58.208 --> 36:00.833
Are those Mom Bucks?

36:00.916 --> 36:02.958
Millions of dollars worth.

36:05.916 --> 36:08.250
That's amazing. Wow!

36:08.333 --> 36:11.375
So, this is why you wanted to come
to Leisure Towers.

36:11.458 --> 36:14.291
Bingo. Now you're starting to get it.

36:14.375 --> 36:15.916
Come on. Let's split it up.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.875
-Ah! Da, da, da, da! Not so fast.

36:18.958 --> 36:20.250
Go find your own supply.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.833
Come on, Rodrick. You owe me.

36:23.750 --> 36:28.250
Fine, here's a hundred.
Don't spend it all in one place.

36:29.125 --> 36:32.583
Now, why don't you go change?
You look like you wet yourself.

36:32.666 --> 36:34.833
I can't. Grandpa's in the bathroom.

36:34.916 --> 36:36.916
Then use the one in the lobby.

36:37.750 --> 36:40.333
<i>I've gotta hand it</i>
<i>to Rodrick on this Mom Bucks thing.</i>

36:40.416 --> 36:42.500
<i>Every time</i>
<i>I think I've figured him all out,</i>

36:42.583 --> 36:44.125
<i>he surprises me with something new.</i>

36:44.916 --> 36:47.625
It's pea soup again tonight, I hear.

36:47.708 --> 36:50.083
That sounds pretty good to me.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.625
Huh?

36:56.500 --> 36:58.333
Oh, my.

37:09.458 --> 37:11.750
Hi, Merle! Going to bingo tonight?

37:11.833 --> 37:13.583
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.708
Well, you can kiss
your winning streak goodbye.

37:16.791 --> 37:18.958
I'm bringing a good luck charm with me.

37:19.041 --> 37:21.541
-Oh! Isn't he cute?

37:21.625 --> 37:25.291
Merle, Irene, bingo tonight?

37:25.375 --> 37:26.708
Ha! We'll see.

37:26.791 --> 37:32.500
Can you believe my luck last week?
Two games in a row.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.833
It was all thanks to my lucky charm.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.083
Say…

37:50.166 --> 37:52.208
"Boys size small?"

37:52.291 --> 37:54.375
A Peeping Tom!

37:58.583 --> 38:02.083
We see you in there, Boy Size Small!

38:02.166 --> 38:05.000
We're gonna hand you over
to the authorities!

38:05.083 --> 38:07.208
They'll put you in the slammer!

38:10.750 --> 38:13.208
-Where did he go?
-I don't see him.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.708
Did he give us the slip?

38:16.958 --> 38:18.125
-There he is!

38:18.208 --> 38:20.291
He's on the move, ladies!

38:30.166 --> 38:31.250
After him!

38:32.708 --> 38:34.916
-Huh? Huh?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.375
-We're coming through!
-Hey! Watch it!

38:37.458 --> 38:39.541
-Don't let him get away!

38:45.250 --> 38:47.208
-You get out of here!

38:48.375 --> 38:50.000
Killing my bingo buzz!

38:50.083 --> 38:51.750
There he is!

38:51.833 --> 38:53.416
There's Boy Size Small.

38:56.166 --> 38:59.041
-Come back here! We're gonna get you!
-Yeah! Yeah!

39:00.583 --> 39:01.583
There he is! Come on!

39:01.666 --> 39:02.958
-Hey, kid!

39:03.041 --> 39:05.000
-Come back here!
-Come on. Wait!

39:05.083 --> 39:06.250
-Out of my way!
-Hey! Get off!

39:06.333 --> 39:07.750
Where do you think you're going?

39:11.166 --> 39:13.458
Hmm, what do we have here?

39:14.583 --> 39:16.375
-Oh!
-Uh…

39:18.791 --> 39:19.791
That's nasty.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.083
-All right!

39:23.666 --> 39:25.333
-Hey!
-There he goes! This way!

39:25.833 --> 39:26.833
D'oh!

39:27.416 --> 39:28.750
Come here!

39:37.375 --> 39:39.791
I could've sworn he went this way.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.291
Where is he?

39:41.375 --> 39:43.083
He gave us the slip.

39:50.291 --> 39:52.916
<i>Somehow, I managed</i>
<i>to get back to Grandpa's room.</i>

39:54.250 --> 40:00.833
<i>But Rodrick can never find out about this.</i>
<i>'Cause if he does, I'm a dead man.</i>

40:00.916 --> 40:03.833
You're in big trouble, young man.

40:07.916 --> 40:10.250
Rodrick just rolled a 12!

40:15.208 --> 40:18.458
That means you've gotta fork over
half your cards.

40:19.416 --> 40:23.000
Come on, snake eyes!

40:25.458 --> 40:30.041
Put some pants on, for the love of Pete.

40:31.583 --> 40:34.083
Is there something you want to tell me,
little brother?

40:48.875 --> 40:49.875
<i>Open up!</i>

40:54.750 --> 40:58.125
Grandpa, can we--
Can we please change the channel?

40:58.208 --> 41:01.041
There's nothing but a bunch of garbage
on TV.

41:01.916 --> 41:03.916
I like to watch people come and go.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.416
<i>Ooh! Hot in there.</i>

41:05.500 --> 41:06.958
Barry Grossman!

41:07.625 --> 41:10.375
You've got time to sit in the sauna
for two hours,

41:10.875 --> 41:14.958
but you can't bother yourself
to return my vacuum cleaner!

41:16.291 --> 41:20.208
Bah, fine! You can have the clicker.

41:21.916 --> 41:25.791
<i>And in some disturbing news,</i>
<i>earlier this evening,</i>

41:25.875 --> 41:29.500
<i>a Peeping Tom was spotted</i>
<i>in the women's bathroom at Leisure--</i>

41:38.166 --> 41:41.583
You're jumpy tonight.
Mind you don't wake up your brother.

41:41.666 --> 41:45.458
Oh, yeah. You're right, Grandpa. There's--
There's nothing good on TV.

41:45.541 --> 41:47.416
Ha! Told you so.

41:47.500 --> 41:53.416
You know, Greg, I might be old,
but I'm no fool.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.083
I know what's really going on.

41:56.666 --> 41:57.666
You do?

41:57.750 --> 42:01.041
You and your brother aren't here
because you want to be here.

42:01.541 --> 42:03.708
Your parents made you come.

42:03.791 --> 42:06.958
That's not true.
Grandpa, we wanted to come here.

42:09.083 --> 42:14.208
No boys your age would choose to spend
the weekend with an old codger like me.

42:14.291 --> 42:17.458
Ha! Yeah, well, I'll tell you this.

42:17.541 --> 42:21.583
I've enjoyed every second of it.
You're good boys.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.083
I guess.

42:25.166 --> 42:30.500
I know you boys love each other,
because you spend time together.

42:31.791 --> 42:36.500
It wasn't always that way with my boys.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.375
And now they've grown apart.

42:39.458 --> 42:42.125
They don't even spend
the holidays together.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.250
I just wish they'd worked things out
when they were young.

42:47.166 --> 42:49.000
Like you and Rodrick have.

42:49.875 --> 42:52.041
Maybe things would be different now.

42:54.250 --> 42:55.250
Yeah.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.625
Hey, Greg.

43:09.583 --> 43:12.000
Rowley, I told you not to wear stripes.

43:12.083 --> 43:14.666
But I thought we could be twins.

43:14.750 --> 43:18.583
Eh, eh? See? Twins.

43:19.416 --> 43:21.000
Great. Now I gotta change.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.833
What did you do
your Life Sciences project on?

43:26.708 --> 43:29.750
-My what?
-Your Life Sciences project.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.000
It's due today.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.458
That's due today?

43:32.541 --> 43:35.791
Yeah. And it's, like, 25% of our grade.

43:35.875 --> 43:39.000
Oh, man! I forgot all about that project.

43:39.083 --> 43:43.625
What are you gonna do?
'Cause this project is 25% of our grade.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.583
I know, Rowley! Let me think.

43:52.166 --> 43:53.166
Rodrick.

43:54.291 --> 43:55.375
Rodrick?

43:59.166 --> 44:00.875
Rodrick! I need your help!

44:00.958 --> 44:04.000
Calm down, Gregory.
What's got your underwear in a bunch?

44:04.083 --> 44:06.166
I've got a Life Science project due today!

44:06.750 --> 44:08.958
Yeah? And what's that got to do with me?

44:09.041 --> 44:12.166
Well, I figured you might know some trick.
Some way out of this.

44:13.291 --> 44:16.333
Well, you could pretend you're sick.
Skip school.

44:16.416 --> 44:19.375
Mom would know I'm faking.
She always knows.

44:19.458 --> 44:21.291
You could tell your teacher Manny ate it.

44:21.375 --> 44:23.625
Really, Rodrick?
That's the best you can come up with?

44:29.208 --> 44:32.958
You know I still have dirt on you, right?
I can come clean to Mom right now.

44:34.833 --> 44:39.291
Hmm. Did you say Life Sciences?
That does ring a bell.

44:40.750 --> 44:42.166
Let's see.

44:42.750 --> 44:43.875
No. No.

44:43.958 --> 44:46.750
-Ah!
-What are you doing?

44:47.375 --> 44:52.041
My life Sciences project.
And in mint condition too.

44:52.750 --> 44:53.750
Let me see that.

44:53.833 --> 44:55.208
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

44:55.291 --> 44:58.125
This is some of my best work.
It's why I saved it.

44:58.208 --> 44:59.541
Awesome. Here, give it.

44:59.625 --> 45:03.166
No, sir. This is gonna cost you.

45:03.250 --> 45:06.875
Come on, Rodrick.
Me and you have a partnership. A deal.

45:06.958 --> 45:11.375
Yeah. Well, our deal doesn't cover
this kind of thing. This is extra.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.083
Okay, what do you want for it?

45:13.166 --> 45:14.666
I want cash.

45:14.750 --> 45:17.000
I don't have any cash.

45:17.083 --> 45:19.791
I'm talking Mom Bucks. Large bills only.

45:19.875 --> 45:21.791
Come on, Rodrick. Don't you have enough?

45:21.875 --> 45:25.625
No, you can never have enough Mom Bucks.
That's Rodrick Rule number five.

45:25.708 --> 45:27.833
Fine. I'll give you 20. That's fair.

45:28.833 --> 45:33.666
Mmm, actually,
you seem a little too eager.

45:33.750 --> 45:34.958
Make it a hundred.

45:37.333 --> 45:39.833
Fine. But you can't tell anyone
about this.

45:40.583 --> 45:44.583
I may be a lot of things,
but one thing I am not is a snitch.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.750
Great doing business with you, brother.

45:56.208 --> 46:02.125
You got one of Rodrick's old projects?
But isn't that cheating?

46:02.208 --> 46:05.208
It's not cheating. It's gaming the system.

46:07.375 --> 46:09.375
I told you not to look at me like that.

46:09.458 --> 46:11.041
But what if he got a bad grade?

46:11.125 --> 46:14.666
My parents always help Rodrick
with his homework. So, I'm all set.

46:14.750 --> 46:15.958
Can I see?

46:17.666 --> 46:22.875
Um, Greg? I don't think
your parents helped with this one.

46:22.958 --> 46:24.208
Give me that!

46:24.791 --> 46:26.791
<i>Do plants sneeze?</i>

46:26.875 --> 46:29.458
<i>Hypothesis. Plants probably sneeze.</i>

46:29.541 --> 46:31.208
<i>Experiment. Hmm.</i>

46:31.291 --> 46:33.458
<i>Conclusion. Plants don't sneeze.</i>

46:38.000 --> 46:39.125
Hmm.

46:39.208 --> 46:41.291
Rodrick!

47:10.291 --> 47:11.625
You lied to me!

47:11.708 --> 47:14.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not true, bro.

47:14.166 --> 47:16.541
You said this was your best work!

47:17.583 --> 47:21.166
It was. You should've seen
my other school projects.

47:22.041 --> 47:23.041
Yeah.

47:23.125 --> 47:24.833
Well, I want my money back.

47:25.333 --> 47:27.750
No refunds. A deal's a deal.

47:28.916 --> 47:32.416
Yeah, about that.
Let's see if these change your mind.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.375
Yo! That's me.

47:38.666 --> 47:41.208
Wha-- Oh. My bad.

47:41.291 --> 47:43.125
Please, uh-- Please continue, bros.

47:44.333 --> 47:47.916
You wouldn't show these to Mom or Dad.
You're no snitch.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.708
You have no idea what I'm willing to do.

47:50.791 --> 47:55.208
All-- All right.
Here, I'll give you your $100 back.

47:55.291 --> 47:59.125
Hmm. You seem a little eager.

47:59.875 --> 48:03.958
It's gonna cost you
approximately 200 Mom Bucks.

48:04.541 --> 48:06.708
Uh, "Mom Bucks"?

48:08.291 --> 48:12.083
Nice doing business with you,
brother.

48:13.458 --> 48:17.083
So, do plants sneeze?

48:19.666 --> 48:23.041
<i>I'm not gonna say</i>
<i>I'm proud of myself for what I did.</i>

48:23.125 --> 48:25.208
<i>But I learned how to negotiate</i>
<i>from the master.</i>

48:38.041 --> 48:41.666
Greg, you need to watch
where you're going.

48:41.750 --> 48:45.000
Just look at this mess.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.583
I don't believe this.

48:55.666 --> 49:00.125
I-- A party? Guys? Seriously?

49:00.208 --> 49:03.708
Counterfeit money?
Where did you boys get all this?

49:04.416 --> 49:09.416
I knew that bathroom locked!
Aha! I am not going crazy.

49:09.500 --> 49:15.166
You boys had a party in our home.
Somebody could've gotten hurt or worse.

49:15.250 --> 49:16.250
See? See?

49:16.333 --> 49:18.958
Didn't I tell you it wasn't a good idea
for these two to be hanging out?

49:19.041 --> 49:24.041
Greg, it might not have been your party,
but you helped cover it up.

49:24.125 --> 49:26.041
You lied to us.

49:26.125 --> 49:27.791
And because of that, you are grounded.

49:27.875 --> 49:31.166
No video games or electronics
for three weeks.

49:31.250 --> 49:33.625
And Rodrick, you're the older brother.

49:33.708 --> 49:36.208
What kind of example are you setting
for Greg?

49:36.291 --> 49:39.333
A bad example?

49:40.416 --> 49:44.041
You're grounded for a month.
Hand over your van keys.

49:46.708 --> 49:48.791
Plus, you boys are doing the dishes
every night.

49:48.875 --> 49:52.458
And don't give me any of this
"my body's on a schedule" nonsense.

49:52.541 --> 49:53.541
Mom?

49:53.625 --> 49:54.625
What, Rodrick?

49:54.708 --> 49:57.500
So, I get that I can't use my van.
Totally fair.

49:58.041 --> 50:01.083
But I can still go to the talent show
if I get a ride, right?

50:01.166 --> 50:05.125
No, Rodrick. Grounded means grounded.
No extracurricular stuff.

50:05.208 --> 50:09.291
But-- But-- But-- But we--
But we've been practicing for months.

50:09.375 --> 50:11.583
If I can't play, the other guys
won't be able to be in the show--

50:11.666 --> 50:14.000
Actions have consequences.

50:14.083 --> 50:18.083
What kind of parents would we be
if we let you go to the talent show?

50:19.125 --> 50:20.791
Good parents?

50:23.791 --> 50:25.708
-Mom?
-Yes, Greg?

50:26.208 --> 50:29.750
Since Rodrick can't be in the talent show,
I can't either, right?

50:29.833 --> 50:31.500
Because that wouldn't be fair.

50:31.583 --> 50:35.916
You are not using this as an excuse
to get out of that talent show, Greg!

50:36.458 --> 50:40.125
You can't let Rowley down.
He's done so much for you.

50:40.208 --> 50:43.041
Now go.
Go help your brother with the dishes.

51:01.708 --> 51:04.375
So, that was pretty crazy back there, huh?

51:05.333 --> 51:08.375
I mean, three weeks of no electronics,
I expected.

51:08.458 --> 51:10.958
But your punishment was a little harsh
if you ask me.

51:11.041 --> 51:14.208
It wouldn't have happened
if you didn't snitch.

51:14.291 --> 51:16.708
Hey, whoa! I didn't say anything!

51:16.791 --> 51:20.000
You marched right upstairs
and went straight to Mommy and Daddy.

51:20.083 --> 51:21.791
You ratted me out!

51:21.875 --> 51:25.458
No snitching.
That's Rodrick Rule number one!

51:25.541 --> 51:29.041
I thought rule number one was
no apostrophes.

51:29.875 --> 51:31.750
And besides, that's not what happened!

51:31.833 --> 51:35.750
I took you under my wing! I trusted you!

51:38.750 --> 51:42.833
Yeah, it's been great.
You've taught me a lot.

51:43.875 --> 51:47.750
Yeah, and the only reason that I did
was because you had dirt on me.

51:47.833 --> 51:50.750
And now you don't. So, watch your back.

51:51.916 --> 51:53.291
But--

51:53.375 --> 51:56.750
I thought you were cool.
Guess I was wrong.

52:06.958 --> 52:11.500
Introducing the Amazing Rowley Jefferson!

52:12.541 --> 52:14.541
Whoo, yeah!

52:15.291 --> 52:21.375
And with a wave of my magic wand,
the egg has disappeared!

52:23.791 --> 52:28.208
Greg, you were supposed to turn the cup
upside down before you gave it back to me.

52:29.625 --> 52:32.041
Huh? Oh, yeah. Next time.

52:32.125 --> 52:36.583
If we don't get this right
by Friday night, we're never gonna win!

52:36.666 --> 52:40.375
We're not gonna win, Rowley.
We're competing against high schoolers.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.083
Well, at least we don't have to go
against your brother's band.

52:45.583 --> 52:49.166
Yes, we do.
They got a replacement drummer.

52:49.250 --> 52:50.625
Oh.

52:51.250 --> 52:53.041
Hey, I've got an idea.

52:53.625 --> 52:55.875
I was thinking
maybe I could be the magician

52:55.958 --> 52:58.291
and you could be the assistant.

52:58.375 --> 53:00.250
It's way more believable that way.

53:00.333 --> 53:04.250
But it's my magic set!
I got it for my birthday!

53:05.416 --> 53:07.291
Okay, okay.

53:07.375 --> 53:08.500
-Gee whiz.

53:08.583 --> 53:10.375
Hey, guys!

53:10.458 --> 53:13.708
Hi, Rodrick. Wanna see some magic?

53:13.791 --> 53:17.083
Nah, wouldn't want you to spoil it for me.
Save it for the big night.

53:17.166 --> 53:19.125
Oh. Okay!

53:19.208 --> 53:21.083
Wait. What are you doing up here?

53:21.166 --> 53:25.416
I found something on the kitchen table.
Thought it might belong to you.

53:26.583 --> 53:28.291
Hey! Give it back!

53:28.375 --> 53:33.291
Easy there, little brother.
I was just returning your property.

53:34.416 --> 53:37.291
Wait. You didn't read it, did you?

53:37.375 --> 53:40.666
Read it?
Way too many words for me.

53:43.458 --> 53:46.625
I did look at the pictures though.

53:46.708 --> 53:48.708
And boy, I learned a lot.

53:48.791 --> 53:53.250
Like what really happened
at Leisure Towers.

53:54.791 --> 53:55.791
That's private.

53:55.875 --> 53:58.500
Well, it's about to be public.

53:58.583 --> 54:00.250
See, I know people.

54:00.333 --> 54:03.916
And those people have little brothers
and sisters that go to your school.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.125
And I'll bet they're gonna love
reading about your little adventure

54:07.208 --> 54:08.208
in the women's bathroom.

54:08.291 --> 54:09.625
You wouldn't!

54:09.708 --> 54:13.500
You ratted me out.
These are the consequences.

54:15.583 --> 54:16.583
Give me that!

54:22.583 --> 54:23.750
Oh!

54:23.833 --> 54:25.250
-Ow!

54:27.500 --> 54:28.666
No!

54:29.791 --> 54:30.958
Ooh!

54:33.541 --> 54:34.666
Nice catch.

54:36.250 --> 54:37.583
-Oops!

54:41.125 --> 54:42.875
No!

54:44.958 --> 54:45.958
My bad.

54:47.333 --> 54:50.541
<i>Believe me, I did not</i>
<i>want to go to school the next day.</i>

54:50.625 --> 54:55.041
<i>After Rodrick's little text was sent out,</i>
<i>my reputation was gonna be ruined.</i>

54:56.375 --> 54:58.166
<i>But I knew I couldn't hide forever.</i>

54:58.250 --> 55:01.916
<i>So, I just decided to bite the bullet</i>
<i>and get it over with.</i>

55:08.125 --> 55:10.750
All right, Rowley. Let's do this.

55:11.291 --> 55:12.291
Rowley?

55:13.583 --> 55:15.625
You got this, Greg!

55:19.666 --> 55:22.041
-This week's flying by, like, so fast.
-I know!

55:22.125 --> 55:24.041
-Wait. Wait. Is that Greg Heffley?
-Look!

55:24.583 --> 55:25.833
Whoa!

55:28.708 --> 55:29.791
What?

55:31.958 --> 55:35.916
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!

55:36.000 --> 55:38.958
<i>It took me a few minutes</i>
<i>to figure out what was going on.</i>

55:40.000 --> 55:42.583
<i>Rodrick's message went out</i>
<i>to all of his friends.</i>

55:44.250 --> 55:47.083
<i>His friends told their brothers</i>
<i>and sisters what happened to me,</i>

55:47.166 --> 55:48.458
<i>and they told their friends.</i>

55:48.541 --> 55:49.541
<i>Just like Rodrick planned it.</i>

55:49.625 --> 55:51.583
<i>But I guess people mixed up the facts</i>

55:51.666 --> 55:55.541
<i>because by the time I got to school,</i>
<i>the story was totally scrambled.</i>

55:58.250 --> 55:59.500
<i>Somehow the story went</i>

55:59.583 --> 56:02.791
<i>from me being caught</i>
<i>in the ladies' room at Leisure Towers,</i>

56:02.875 --> 56:07.166
<i>to me sneaking into a bingo game</i>
<i>and walking off with the grand prize.</i>

56:07.250 --> 56:09.750
Bingo!

56:10.916 --> 56:14.458
<i>And the only thing people got right was</i>
<i>me getting chased by the security guards.</i>

56:14.541 --> 56:16.916
<i>But even that stuff got exaggerated.</i>

56:18.833 --> 56:19.958
-Hey!

56:20.041 --> 56:21.041
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

56:27.416 --> 56:29.375
<i>Even the thing</i>
<i>with the vending machines</i>

56:29.458 --> 56:30.541
<i>made it into the story,</i>

56:30.625 --> 56:32.291
<i>but the facts got mixed up there too.</i>

56:33.833 --> 56:36.833
<i>I wasn't exactly in a hurry</i>
<i>to set the record straight, though.</i>

56:36.916 --> 56:40.250
<i>Because the new version of the story</i>
<i>made me look pretty sick.</i>

56:44.500 --> 56:46.666
<i>So Rodrick's plan backfired,</i>

56:46.750 --> 56:49.000
<i>and I got a taste of what it's like</i>
<i>to be popular for once.</i>

56:49.083 --> 56:51.541
Wow! This is so cool! I got his autograph!

56:52.375 --> 56:54.125
<i>But I knew it wouldn't last.</i>

56:54.791 --> 56:58.208
<i>Because the second I took the stage</i>
<i>as Rowley's assistant at the talent show,</i>

56:58.291 --> 57:00.250
<i>my reputation was gonna take a nosedive.</i>

57:00.333 --> 57:03.875
I don't get
why I have to go to this thing.

57:03.958 --> 57:08.500
You're here to cheer on your brother,
Rodrick, and your bandmates.

57:08.583 --> 57:10.166
Ex-bandmates.

57:10.875 --> 57:14.916
D-Does the rec center have
a bathroom?

57:27.958 --> 57:31.208
Okay. Everyone, hop out.
I'll go look for a spot.

57:40.166 --> 57:42.500
Yo! What's shaking, little man?

57:42.583 --> 57:43.791
Uh, nothing much.

57:43.875 --> 57:47.541
So, we heard about your little dustup
over at Leisure Towers.

57:47.625 --> 57:48.625
The what?

57:49.250 --> 57:50.375
Oh, yeah. That.

57:50.458 --> 57:53.041
Dude, you're a legend!

57:53.125 --> 57:55.500
An absolute lege, dude!

57:55.583 --> 57:56.875
Yeah, I guess.

57:56.958 --> 57:58.625
So, we were thinking,

57:59.333 --> 58:03.666
if we join forces tonight,
we could win this thing.

58:03.750 --> 58:05.458
Huh? I-I don't get it.

58:05.541 --> 58:08.750
You've got the middle school vote.
And we've got the high school vote.

58:08.833 --> 58:11.208
And I've got the Mom vote. Not to brag.

58:11.291 --> 58:13.125
What do you mean "join forces"?

58:13.208 --> 58:18.250
How'd you like to be
Löded Diper's new drummer?

58:18.791 --> 58:20.833
What? I don't know how to play the drums.

58:20.916 --> 58:22.875
We know your brother's been teaching you.

58:22.958 --> 58:26.583
Time for the student to become the master.

58:26.666 --> 58:31.291
Sorry, guys. I'm in my friend's magic act.
I can't get out of it.

58:31.375 --> 58:37.708
That's where Larry comes in.
We'll do a clean swap. You for him.

58:37.791 --> 58:39.791
Magic is my real passion.

58:40.333 --> 58:41.666
Ta-da!

58:42.166 --> 58:46.166
I just can't do that to Rodrick.
He's my brother.

58:47.250 --> 58:48.833
Why don't you just think it over?

58:49.750 --> 58:52.416
Maybe this is your turn to shine, my dude.

59:04.083 --> 59:05.541
I'll think about it.

59:06.041 --> 59:08.750
That's all we're asking, little man.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.416
-Yo! It's Greg!
-That's Greg Heffley!

59:37.041 --> 59:39.875
-You're a legend, dude.
-Yeah, thanks.

59:41.166 --> 59:42.458
Oh!

59:42.541 --> 59:44.916
Is that Boy Size Small?

59:47.958 --> 59:49.000
Where were you?

59:49.083 --> 59:50.500
I just got held up.

1:00:01.625 --> 1:00:04.666
Oh, this is so exciting.

1:00:06.166 --> 1:00:09.750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!</i>

1:00:09.833 --> 1:00:14.458
-<i>Welcome to the Talent Show!</i>

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.750
Then the man in the orthopedic shoes said,
"I stand corrected!"

1:00:53.291 --> 1:00:54.291
Oh.

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:12.458
I've got to get ready.

1:01:12.541 --> 1:01:14.500
-Break a leg, Greg.
-Okay.

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:17.625
Do your best for Rowley.
Try and look like you're having fun.

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:18.708
Hey, Greg.

1:01:19.625 --> 1:01:24.125
Can't wait to see you do your magic.
So uncool.

1:01:30.208 --> 1:01:32.541
Are you ready for some magic, Manny?

1:01:32.625 --> 1:01:35.208
-Yay!
-Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1:01:35.291 --> 1:01:38.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

1:01:38.791 --> 1:01:41.833
We have just one question for you.

1:01:41.916 --> 1:01:43.583
-Wake up!

1:01:43.666 --> 1:01:48.250
Are you ready to rock?

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:51.083
Yeah!

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:57.000
Now, before we explode your eardrums
with a blast of pure rock and roll,

1:01:58.041 --> 1:02:03.000
it's time to introduce
the newest member of Löded Diper.

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:09.666
Please join me in welcoming
Greg Heffley to the stage!

1:02:09.750 --> 1:02:10.708
-Greg?

1:02:20.125 --> 1:02:22.916
Come on, little dude. Give 'em a taste.

1:02:25.791 --> 1:02:27.833
Oh. Oof.

1:02:44.416 --> 1:02:46.541
Yeah, right on.

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:48.375
We love you, Greg!

1:02:48.458 --> 1:02:54.125
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!
Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg!

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:18.375
Yo, you ready
to blow the roof off this place?

1:03:38.333 --> 1:03:40.375
Hey. You're missing the show.

1:03:40.958 --> 1:03:45.083
What are you doing out here?
Aren't you supposed to be on stage?

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:47.333
I don't know. It didn't feel right.

1:03:47.416 --> 1:03:50.291
Well, maybe that's because it's not right.

1:03:50.833 --> 1:03:55.250
You stole my spot just to get back at me
for the diary thing.

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:59.458
Pretty much.
But it wasn't just about payback.

1:03:59.541 --> 1:04:01.500
Yeah, right.

1:04:02.208 --> 1:04:05.208
I, uh, wanted you to be proud of me.

1:04:05.291 --> 1:04:07.916
Proud of you? For what?

1:04:08.541 --> 1:04:11.291
I-I know. I-It was dumb.

1:04:13.166 --> 1:04:16.000
I've got something that I've got to
get off my chest too, I guess.

1:04:16.083 --> 1:04:20.291
I-- I shouldn't have taken your diary.

1:04:21.125 --> 1:04:24.125
That wasn't… cool.

1:04:26.250 --> 1:04:30.333
I don't understand why we can't
just get along like normal brothers.

1:04:30.833 --> 1:04:33.708
This is normal. Brothers fight.

1:04:34.208 --> 1:04:37.375
We just… took it too far.

1:04:37.875 --> 1:04:42.500
But do you think we're gonna be all right,
like, in the long run?

1:04:42.583 --> 1:04:45.375
What? What do you mean?

1:04:45.458 --> 1:04:49.583
Well, Dad and his brothers don't even
see each other on holidays anymore.

1:04:49.666 --> 1:04:51.875
Is that gonna happen to us?

1:04:57.416 --> 1:05:01.500
Heck, yeah, we're gonna see each other
on the holidays. We're family.

1:05:04.916 --> 1:05:07.625
But I am not hosting. Too much work.

1:05:07.708 --> 1:05:09.750
Okay. Deal.

1:05:09.833 --> 1:05:12.750
Listen, me and you
are gonna have our battles.

1:05:13.333 --> 1:05:15.875
But I really hope you know
that when the chips are down,

1:05:15.958 --> 1:05:18.666
and I mean really down,

1:05:18.750 --> 1:05:22.041
I'm gonna have your back.
And you better have mine.

1:05:22.125 --> 1:05:24.875
Because it's the Heffley brothers
against the world.

1:05:26.458 --> 1:05:27.625
The Heffley brothers.

1:05:29.833 --> 1:05:32.875
Greg! Greg! Greg!

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:37.041
So? Are you gonna keep sitting out here,
or are you gonna go make me proud?

1:05:37.625 --> 1:05:41.541
Yeah, about that.
These don't belong to me.

1:05:47.083 --> 1:05:50.416
Like you said, there's only one Rodrick.
And that's you.

1:05:55.375 --> 1:05:57.291
Wait a second.
I'm still grounded.

1:05:57.375 --> 1:05:59.416
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:04.291
Oh, well. Rodrick Rule number
ten. Always go out in a blaze of glory.

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:08.500
-Come on, entertain us!

1:06:08.583 --> 1:06:13.000
Stand by. Uh, we're just having some,
uh, technical difficulties.

1:06:14.625 --> 1:06:16.708
All right!

1:06:16.791 --> 1:06:22.541
Please welcome
Löded Diper's original drummer,

1:06:22.625 --> 1:06:24.583
Rodrick Heffley!

1:06:24.666 --> 1:06:26.833
-Whoo!

1:06:26.916 --> 1:06:28.166
-What?
-Rodrick?

1:06:38.083 --> 1:06:40.041
Rodrick rules!

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:42.250
We love you, Rodrick!

1:06:43.125 --> 1:06:44.583
Unbelievable.

1:06:47.791 --> 1:06:51.750
Greg, you do understand
that you're both grounded?

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:53.291
Yeah, I know.

1:06:53.375 --> 1:06:55.583
Rodrick isn't supposed to be up there.

1:06:56.333 --> 1:06:59.583
So, we have no choice
but to extend your punishment.

1:07:01.791 --> 1:07:02.791
It's worth it.

1:07:02.875 --> 1:07:05.416
He's my brother. I've got his back.

1:07:09.583 --> 1:07:12.583
You're raising some good boys there, Son.

1:07:13.708 --> 1:07:14.708
Yeah.

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:36.708
-Yippee!

1:07:36.791 --> 1:07:38.666
-Whoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

1:07:50.208 --> 1:07:51.208
Come on!

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.458
Huh?

1:08:04.291 --> 1:08:06.791
-Yeah! Löded Diper!
-Uh-huh! Yeah!

1:08:10.708 --> 1:08:12.541
Whoo! That's my jam!

1:08:31.833 --> 1:08:33.500
What? Susan!

1:08:33.583 --> 1:08:34.916
Yeah!

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.083
Whoo-hoo!

1:08:41.458 --> 1:08:42.458
Susan, your bunions!

1:08:42.541 --> 1:08:43.833
Whoo!

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.208
-Oh, man!
-Look at her!

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:56.416
-Oh! See, I can't unsee that!

1:08:56.500 --> 1:08:57.500
That's right.

1:08:58.041 --> 1:09:00.250
-Whoo-hoo!
-Oh. Whoo!

1:09:02.958 --> 1:09:06.750
<i>Even after all that,</i>
<i>Löded Diper didn't win the talent show.</i>

1:09:06.833 --> 1:09:09.333
<i>First place went to</i>
<i>the Amazing Rowley Jefferson</i>

1:09:09.416 --> 1:09:11.958
<i>and his assistant Larry the Wonderful.</i>

1:09:13.291 --> 1:09:15.875
<i>But it wasn't all bad news</i>
<i>for Rodrick and his band.</i>

1:09:15.958 --> 1:09:18.958
<i>Thanks to Mom,</i>
<i>their music reached a whole new audience.</i>

1:09:29.458 --> 1:09:32.333
<i>I'm really not too worried</i>
<i>about me and Rodrick growing apart.</i>

1:09:32.833 --> 1:09:35.625
<i>Sure, we'll have our ups and downs,</i>
<i>but for now…</i>

1:09:37.208 --> 1:09:38.208
<i>…we're cool.</i>
