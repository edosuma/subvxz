09:36.445 --> 09:37.794
What did you tell her?

09:37.838 --> 09:39.100
I stalled.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.755
What was I supposed to do?

09:43.844 --> 09:44.975
Hey.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.154
I think you already know.

09:50.198 --> 09:53.288
Leon, I swore

09:53.331 --> 09:54.855
that she would never find out.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.421
Yeah.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.859
And I understand why.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.731
But, Jack, this is, um...

10:01.775 --> 10:04.299
this is not
an easy genie to keep

10:04.342 --> 10:06.127
in the bottle these days.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.086
Between social media

10:09.130 --> 10:10.653
and-and online
DNA sites,

10:10.697 --> 10:13.264
she's gonna figure
this out eventually.

10:13.308 --> 10:16.180
I know, I know, I just...

10:16.224 --> 10:19.096
I just want to protect her.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.838
Of course you do,
because you're her parent.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.276
Please, barely.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.887
No.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.976
There's no middle ground.

10:29.019 --> 10:32.327
You either are or you're not.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.068
Okay, Director Yoda.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.940
[laughs]

10:36.984 --> 10:40.552
So what the hell do I do?

10:40.596 --> 10:45.340
Like I said...
I think you already know.

10:48.343 --> 10:51.085
TORRES:
Ah, that college smell.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.000
Doesn't it make you
all nostalgic?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.697
Can we just focuson the case?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.090
MAN: Ready for
something new?

10:56.133 --> 10:57.482
Aspire is ready for you.Excuse me...

10:57.526 --> 10:59.310
you know where
we can find the dean?

10:59.354 --> 11:01.182
Oh! You found him.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.880
Dean Patterson.NCIS.

11:03.924 --> 11:08.319
Oh, great. The career day
speakers are right this way.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.278
The students are
very excited.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.410
Actually, that's notwhat we're here for.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.848
Ooh, wait, is that,
is that a MakeItMax Pro?

11:14.891 --> 11:16.893
Now can youjust focus

11:16.937 --> 11:18.503
on the case?Actually,

11:18.547 --> 11:21.028
that is the
MakeItMax Quantum.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.682
One of only five in the state.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.119
TORRES:Right. Well, we're not herefor career day.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.424
We're looking for
Beverly Berkshire.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.599
Know her?

11:27.643 --> 11:29.253
Of course.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.342
We're a new school,
and still pretty small,

11:31.386 --> 11:33.127
so I know all of our students.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.999
Student? We thought
she was a teacher.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.654
And one day maybe
she will be.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.440
At Aspire Technical College,
we have students of all ages,

11:42.484 --> 11:44.616
but we cater to people
looking to make a fresh start

11:44.660 --> 11:46.401
in their lives.

11:46.444 --> 11:50.274
If you're ready for something
new, Aspire is ready for you.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.233
We have a student
loan seminar

11:52.276 --> 11:54.496
starting in five.
Do you want to sit in?

11:54.539 --> 11:56.846
[chuckles]
Beverly.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.326
Berkshire.Ah.

11:58.369 --> 12:02.199
She should be in computer lab
about now.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.506
I hope she isn't
in any kind of trouble.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.551
So does she.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.424
Yeah, I left that voice mail.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.947
But you guys
are totally overreacting.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.427
You threatened to shove

12:12.470 --> 12:14.995
Petty Officer Whistler's
intestines down his throat.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.127
And then you said,
"You're dead."

12:17.171 --> 12:19.782
I was beingmetaphorical.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.392
Well, now he's dead.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.265
MAN:Whoa.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.136
That guy is totally dead.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.747
Can we help you?

12:27.790 --> 12:31.402
I, um...
I got locked out again.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.622
You literallywrote the password on your arm.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.798
Now shoo!Oh, that's right.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.278
That's my new lab partner.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.149
Jeremy was my oldlab partner.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.934
He didn't show up for class
last week, so I got assigned

12:40.977 --> 12:42.457
Stephen Hawking
over there.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.024
So what happened?

12:44.067 --> 12:46.374
You mean, aside from you sayingyou were gonna kill him,

12:46.417 --> 12:47.418
and then somebody killing him?

12:47.462 --> 12:48.463
[scoffs]TORRES:Voice mail.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.074
Talk.Like I said,

12:51.118 --> 12:52.815
Jeremy and I shared a computer.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.425
Last week, I noticed someonehad used our log-in

12:54.469 --> 12:55.992
to hack into the school network.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.299
They were capturing
student financial data.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.474
And you're suggesting

12:59.517 --> 13:00.692
that that was
Petty Officer Whistler.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.346
Well, it sure as hell
wasn't me.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.653
And Jeremy was the only other
person that had the password.

13:04.696 --> 13:07.438
If you thought that Whistler
was hacking the school,

13:07.482 --> 13:09.876
why not report him?Nobody would've believed me.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.573
Look, I was tutoring
half the class for free.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.837
Everyone thought Jeremy
was a saint.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.534
And I might have a prior.

13:17.405 --> 13:18.449
Or two.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.711
For...?

13:19.755 --> 13:21.670
Bank fraud.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.324
See the problem?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.848
So when I found out what Jeremywas doing on ourcomputer,

13:25.892 --> 13:26.936
I lost my cool.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.633
But all I wanted was
for him to stop.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.157
So why do you think
Petty Officer Whistler

13:30.200 --> 13:32.724
was trying to access
student financial information?

13:32.768 --> 13:34.509
Are you kidding me?

13:34.552 --> 13:36.728
[exhales]
Do you not know who he is?

13:36.772 --> 13:38.426
I thought that's whyyou guys were really here.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.862
Who is he?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.429
TerrorCastor.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.780
TerrorCastor? The hacker?
You're kidding.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.868
We shared a computerfor two months.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.869
I saw his raw code.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.828
I'm telling you,
he's TerrorCastor.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.743
Okay, pretend like you're
talking to someone cool.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.354
TerrorCastor is number nine

13:53.397 --> 13:55.530
on the FBI's
Cyber Most Wanted list.

13:55.573 --> 13:58.750
He likes to target food stamprecipients and old grandmas.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.796
I thought you said
he was a saint.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.843
I said people thoughthe was a saint.

14:03.886 --> 14:07.150
But that guy was the devil.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.902
So, our victim wasn't
Mr. Nice Guy after all.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.469
I could've
told you that.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.253
Oh, yeah? How?

14:23.297 --> 14:25.342
Thin lips.Is that a thing?

14:25.386 --> 14:27.344
Nana Palmer always said,
"You never trust a man

14:27.388 --> 14:28.563
with thin lips."

14:28.606 --> 14:31.392
Or an FBI task forceafter them.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.915
Let's hear it.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.875
FBI just sent over their
case files on TerrorCastor.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.920
This is definitely our guy.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.487
They've been after
him for years.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.358
He's done everything
from bank phishing

14:41.402 --> 14:42.882
to the Nigerian prince scam.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.622
Mostly targetsthe elderly.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.190
Maybe he pissed off
the wrong nana.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.800
What abouthis lab partner?

14:48.844 --> 14:50.063
Her story checks out.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.978
She's got an alibi
for the time of death.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.414
Run down his victims.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.155
Someone looking for revenge.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.505
Boss, there's a lot
of names in this file.

14:57.548 --> 14:58.767
It's gonna take a while.

14:58.810 --> 14:59.942
Get Jack to help.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.813
Well, she hasn't
shown up yet.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.076
Which actually is
really strange,

15:03.119 --> 15:05.078
'cause usually she's
the first one to work.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.296
Tim.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.819
I'm on it.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.386
You confirm C.O.D.?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.998
Our Navy Reservist was
definitely strangled to death.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.304
But I'm having a tough time
figuring out by what.

15:14.348 --> 15:18.047
These, uh, ligature marks
are unlike any rope or wire

15:18.091 --> 15:19.005
that I've ever seen.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.485
What's that?

15:21.529 --> 15:24.967
Oh, that is why we call
you Eagle Eye Leroy.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.229
[chuckles]

15:26.273 --> 15:28.753
We don't-- we don't
really call you that.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.103
I just made that up.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.888
That's a knife wound.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.890
Uh, based on the
scar tissue, I'd say

15:34.934 --> 15:36.631
it's no more than
a few months old.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.067
Based on the angle
of the injury, I'd say

15:38.111 --> 15:39.764
it was definitely
an attack.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.028
And, Gibbs, a wound
in this location

15:42.071 --> 15:43.943
would've been impossible
to hide from his wife.

15:43.986 --> 15:47.250
I think she knows more
than she's been telling you.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.299
Got a second?No, not really.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.562
I just came to pick upa few of my husband's things.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.564
You can talk to us now,

15:56.607 --> 15:59.741
or you can talk to usin interrogation.

15:59.784 --> 16:03.049
You lied to us.

16:03.092 --> 16:06.095
Look, we know your husband
was a wanted hacker,

16:06.139 --> 16:08.010
and we're guessing
you know that, too.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.360
No. He was a soup kitchen...Soup kitchen cat hero,

16:10.404 --> 16:13.973
and you can't think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him.

16:14.016 --> 16:14.974
GIBBS:
Somebody did.

16:15.017 --> 16:15.975
He was stabbeda few months ago.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.977
Yeah, now he's dead.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.936
So, if you want to find out
who made that happen...

16:20.980 --> 16:22.546
Talk.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.634
Who stabbed him?

16:23.678 --> 16:25.636
No, no. Don't you
dare stand here

16:25.680 --> 16:27.943
in your fancy clothes
and judge my husband.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.684
He was a good man.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.207
He was a criminal.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.557
He did what he had to do
to protect his family.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.951
From what? Having to
make an honest living?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.345
Our daughter was sick.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.129
She was born with
a neuroblastoma,

16:40.173 --> 16:41.870
and we nearly went
bankrupt trying to pay

16:41.913 --> 16:43.045
for her doctor bills.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.786
So, yeah, we were desperate.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.006
Jeremy wasn't a...

16:47.049 --> 16:48.964
you know, a
rocket scientist.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.010
He was a
blue-collar guy,

16:51.053 --> 16:52.968
and the only way that he could
make the money that we needed

16:53.012 --> 16:54.187
was to cut a
few corners.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.058
He cut too many.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.668
Is any of that even true?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.714
Okay, clearly, you don't get it.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.672
Jeremy hated
what he did.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.022
He was looking to
make a fresh start.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.588
Why do you think he
was going back to school?

17:04.632 --> 17:06.590
He was looking for new targets.

17:06.634 --> 17:10.159
He was stealing credit card
info from his classmates.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.337
Who stabbed him?

17:14.381 --> 17:17.036
Hell, it was probably you.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.299
No.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.779
No, it wasn't me.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.565
And fine, yeah,

17:24.608 --> 17:27.220
I know who stabbed him.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.832
His best friend.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.008
Taye Tanner,the bestie.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.314
These two

17:34.357 --> 17:36.185
were pretty tight.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.928
They both got twin juvie recordsfor, uh, petty larceny.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.017
In high school, they
started a gang called

17:42.061 --> 17:44.106
the Twin Tornados.
Then they joined

17:44.150 --> 17:45.716
the Navy together.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.153
How'd that work out?Well,

17:47.196 --> 17:48.719
Taye was caught skimming
Social Security numbers

17:48.763 --> 17:50.112
from his shipmates.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.635
He was dishonorably
discharged,

17:51.679 --> 17:54.116
then dropped off the map.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.727
Ah. I see
why you're down here now.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.425
You can't find him.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.166
There's a rumor you have a lead.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.342
As it turns out,I have been digging

18:02.385 --> 18:05.040
in the dark webfor posts by TerrorCastor.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.259
But I ended up finding

18:06.302 --> 18:08.391
a lot more by this guy
who calls himself

18:08.435 --> 18:09.740
TerrorPollux.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.221
I think that's
your bestie.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.136
Okay. Why?Uh...

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
Hello? Castor and Pollux,

18:16.182 --> 18:19.098
the two brightest stars
in the constellation Gemini.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.230
If Whistler
is your Castor,

18:21.274 --> 18:24.146
Pollux has got to be
this Taye guy.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.713
Were you ableto get an IP address

18:25.756 --> 18:26.844
on the posts?

18:26.888 --> 18:28.150
Uh, no. It is the dark web.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.152
I am lucky
that I made it out alive.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.936
But TerrorPollux

18:31.980 --> 18:33.416
does havean Instagram feed.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.418
Now, he never posts
a photo of his face.

18:35.462 --> 18:38.334
But I noticed, every
day, without fail,

18:38.378 --> 18:40.728
he posts a photoof mint chocolate

18:40.771 --> 18:42.512
ice cream.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.688
Okay, I'll callthe REACT team.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.734
All right, hold your horses,
McSarcasm.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.389
Notice how he's doing
something different every day

18:49.432 --> 18:50.999
before he gets his fix?

18:51.042 --> 18:52.740
"Rocking the mint chip

18:52.783 --> 18:54.568
after hitting the gym."

18:54.611 --> 18:55.960
"Nothinglike peppermint bonbons

18:56.004 --> 18:57.614
after a sweat lodge."

18:57.658 --> 18:59.921
Wednesday is
laser tag day.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.706
Now, look at what he posted
the same day last week.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.491
"Walking over to snag

19:04.534 --> 19:06.841
my mint 'n chip after killing itat laser tag."

19:06.884 --> 19:08.843
Yeah. See where this is going?

19:08.886 --> 19:11.585
Yeah. We need to find outhow many laser tag places

19:11.628 --> 19:13.630
are within walking distanceof ice cream parlors.

19:13.674 --> 19:14.631
Ooh.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.416
One.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.808
So, go arrest his ass.

19:17.852 --> 19:22.030
And then bring Mama
back some rocky road.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.901
Yeah.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.816
Mm.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.470
TORRES:
All right, laser tag place

19:27.514 --> 19:30.256
said Taye left about
five minutes ago.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.693
Must be mint chip time.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.216
There's a lot of kids in there.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.957
Let's waitand see if he's gonna come out.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.958
All right.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.916
Good by me.Yeah.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.918
TORRES:So, what does this guy do again

19:40.962 --> 19:42.833
that he can play
laser tag all day?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.879
Steals from old people.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.446
Oh, wow.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.448
Now, that's a guy
that should be ashamed

19:48.491 --> 19:49.971
to show up to his reunion.

19:50.014 --> 19:50.841
[chuckles]

19:50.885 --> 19:52.887
Which reminds me...

19:52.930 --> 19:54.889
[sighs]

19:54.932 --> 19:57.021
I really want to go.

19:57.065 --> 20:01.461
I want to go, but I just thinkit's too much for Delilah.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.507
Uh-huh.

20:04.551 --> 20:05.943
Sure.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.945
Look, do you know
that I graduated

20:07.989 --> 20:10.687
with a biomedical engineeringdegree from Johns Hopkins?

20:10.731 --> 20:12.298
This another midlife crisis?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.169
You know what most of myclassmates are doing right now?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.867
Half of themare rich CEOs

20:16.911 --> 20:19.870
of biotech companies, flyingaround on their private jets.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.350
What am I?

20:21.394 --> 20:22.482
A cop with a gun.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.179
Yeah, on a government salary.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.094
With a gun.

20:26.137 --> 20:31.186
You're NCIS Senior Special
Agent Timothy frickin' McGee.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.797
You eat corrupt CEOs
for breakfast

20:33.841 --> 20:36.017
and murderers for lunch.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.018
Yeah, but...

20:37.061 --> 20:38.759
No, no. There's
no buts, man.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.457
You shouldn't be embarrassed toshow your face at the reunion.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.894
Your-your classmates
should be embarrassed

20:43.938 --> 20:46.723
to stand in the same room
as you.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.901
Tim.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.729
I'm serious, man.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.166
You're really good
at what you do.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.213
Man.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.433
You should be proud.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.349
Thanks, Nick.

21:03.392 --> 21:04.480
Thank you, man.

21:04.524 --> 21:05.829
I appreciate that.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.355
Ooh, there's our guy.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.660
Want me to take this?

21:12.096 --> 21:13.097
No, you know what? I got him.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.450
BISHOP:
Thanks.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.016
All right. They got him.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.062
Torres and McGee
are bringing him in now.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.803
Hey.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.283
Tag team with McGee
in interrogation?

21:25.545 --> 21:28.025
Work up a profile?

21:28.069 --> 21:29.810
Jack!

21:29.853 --> 21:31.681
What was that about?

21:32.726 --> 21:33.901
Got no idea.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.511
Hmm.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.126
[knock on door]

21:44.085 --> 21:46.305
Was that a "no"to the interrogation with McGee?

21:47.349 --> 21:49.177
Hey.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.881
You okay, Jack?

21:57.925 --> 22:01.624
Uh, Faith came to see me.

22:01.668 --> 22:04.279
She wants to know
who her father is.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.022
Tell her.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.024
Hmm.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.243
It's not that simple.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.640
I was 19.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.947
A sophomore in college.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.342
Some friends
asked me out.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.345
And we went to a party,
and I drank too much.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.782
Waytoo much.

22:30.174 --> 22:33.047
I asked one of my friends
to drive me home.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.614
Someone I was close with.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.138
Someone I trusted.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.923
And he raped me.

22:40.968 --> 22:44.972
After it happened,
I blamed myself.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.974
For drinking too much.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.976
For putting myself
in that situation.

22:49.019 --> 22:52.762
All the things that
survivors put on themselves.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.460
[clears throat]Eventually,

22:54.503 --> 22:56.505
I left school over it.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.029
Six weeks later,

22:59.073 --> 23:00.466
I found out I was pregnant.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.337
Can you imagine?

23:03.904 --> 23:06.689
After the adoption,
I joined the Army

23:06.733 --> 23:08.865
to get my life
back on track.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.868
Tested into PsyOps.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.654
The rest is history.

23:17.961 --> 23:21.095
Uh, aren't you
gonna say anything?

23:21.138 --> 23:23.880
What's his name?

23:33.020 --> 23:34.935
Conversation's not over.

23:34.978 --> 23:35.849
Oh, yes, it is.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.372
Will you slow down?

23:37.416 --> 23:38.939
It was just a question.

23:39.983 --> 23:42.116
And you're not getting
an answer.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.423
Why do you thinkI never told you before?

23:45.989 --> 23:49.471
Because you thoughtI was gonna go kill the guy?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.560
Because I couldn't
stand the idea

23:51.604 --> 23:54.476
of you looking at me like
I'm some sort of a victim.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.392
Like I'm a fragile teacup
in need of saving.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.960
And that's exactly
what you're doing.No, I'm not.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.701
It's a guy thing.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.224
Okay.

24:03.267 --> 24:07.054
This isn't about ancient
history that can't be changed.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.622
This is about Faith today.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.624
[exhales]

24:11.667 --> 24:14.844
Look, I get that you're mad.

24:14.888 --> 24:18.805
Okay? And all I can say
is welcome to the club.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.721
I've been a member
for almost 30 years.

24:21.764 --> 24:25.725
Please, I can handle
this on my own.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.031
TORRES:
Um...

24:28.075 --> 24:31.905
[clears throat] So, the bestie
is in the interrogation room.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.995
But, of course,
I can come back.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.866
No, no, it's-it's fine.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.347
We're finished
here anyway.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.877
This was my favorite hoodie.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.836
You know chocolate stains, bro.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.881
Yeah, I wouldn't
worry about it.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.144
You'll be exchanging it
for an orange jumpsuit

24:54.188 --> 24:55.319
soon enough.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.669
[scoffs]

24:56.712 --> 24:58.888
We know you're the hackerTerrorPollux.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.890
Oh, is that what you know?

25:00.934 --> 25:02.849
Yeah. And we also know

25:02.892 --> 25:05.852
that Petty Officer Whistler
was TerrorCastor.

25:05.895 --> 25:09.333
Wait, what do you mean "was"?

25:09.377 --> 25:10.770
It's called past tense.

25:10.813 --> 25:13.381
We use it when we're talkingabout people who are dead.

25:13.424 --> 25:14.948
[door opens]Or, in this case...

25:14.991 --> 25:16.776
Murdered.So start talking.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.648
Now.A-About what?

25:19.692 --> 25:21.258
You're crazy if you
think I killed Jeremy.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.956
[chuckles]:
I mean, that was my homie.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.000
I-I would never.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.393
You shoved a knife into him.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.221
We got an eyewitness
that said you stabbed Jeremy

25:27.264 --> 25:28.439
three months ago.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.790
Now he's downin our morgue.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.879
Do you see what
we're getting at here?

25:34.620 --> 25:37.361
Okay. Look,

25:37.405 --> 25:40.451
Jeremy and me just had a
simple misunderstanding.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.583
That's all.

25:41.627 --> 25:42.976
Over what?

25:44.630 --> 25:46.588
Orange jumpsuit.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.113
So, about a year ago,

25:50.157 --> 25:52.855
Jeremy and me started selling
security software online.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.944
To get rid of viruses
on people's computers.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.946
Viruses that you puton their computers

25:56.990 --> 25:59.122
in the first place.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.080
Prove it.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.169
Misunderstanding!

26:02.212 --> 26:03.997
All right, so, we're
making a killing.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.043
Dumped, like, 50 grand into
a numbered offshore account.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.089
That sounds completely legit.

26:09.132 --> 26:12.092
And then suddenly, the
account gets cleared out.

26:12.135 --> 26:14.660
Jeremy acted like he had
no idea what happened,

26:14.703 --> 26:16.009
but I'll tell you what happened.

26:16.052 --> 26:17.184
He's the one that took it.

26:17.227 --> 26:19.099
I mean,
that turncoat stole from me.

26:19.142 --> 26:20.187
So you killed him?

26:20.230 --> 26:21.928
No, no, no, no.
I confronted him.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.930
And things got heated.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.367
My knife might've,
you know...

26:26.410 --> 26:27.586
slipped.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.544
The wound was four inches deep.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.980
He lived.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.635
And that was the last time
I saw that thief.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.072
Look, I don't know who
killed him, but it wasn't me.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.728
Well, he was right.
It wasn't him.

26:39.772 --> 26:43.123
And he hasthe saddest alibi possible.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.300
He was at a laser tagconvention in Ohio

26:46.343 --> 26:48.389
when Petty Officer Whistler
was murdered.

26:48.432 --> 26:50.043
Talk to the wife again.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.740
About what?

26:51.784 --> 26:54.351
I mean, all she's gonna do
is tell us about the amount

26:54.395 --> 26:56.136
of kittensher husband rescued.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.965
Our revenge theorywas a bust, too.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.228
Most of Whistler's hacking
victims were out of state

27:01.271 --> 27:03.534
when he was killed,and the ones that were

27:03.578 --> 27:05.362
closer byall alibi'd out.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.538
So I have...Nothing.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.062
All of you got nothing.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.413
Well, not for lack of effort.

27:12.456 --> 27:15.155
Boss, we ran downalmost 400 names.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.722
Well, run it down again.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.114
Boss...

27:18.158 --> 27:19.420
We missed something.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.422
So recheck everything.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.032
The crime scene.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.033
The wife.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.861
Computers at the school.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.428
Somebody killed this guy!

27:27.471 --> 27:29.386
Find out who.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.914
Well, Gibbs is mad.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.829
Oh, yeah. I noticed.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.353
About what?

27:43.879 --> 27:46.577
[birds chirping]

28:14.649 --> 28:16.346
Jackie Sloane. My God.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.957
What are you doing here?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.349
How long has it been?

28:19.393 --> 28:21.656
Haven't seen you
since Santa Barbara.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.747
Spare me the buddy routine.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.444
We're not friends.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.142
And you can probably guesswhy I'm here.

28:29.185 --> 28:32.058
Um, no, not really.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.670
Then let me jog your memory.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.760
You raped me.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.764
After the homecoming dance.

28:42.808 --> 28:46.855
You drove me homeand attacked me.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.858
H-Hold on. You'd been flirting
with me for months.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.208
You asked me to drive you home
because you wanted...

28:52.252 --> 28:54.776
What I wanted wasfor you to stop!

28:54.820 --> 28:57.823
I said no! Over and over again.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.259
I said no!

28:59.302 --> 29:01.696
If you had said no,
I would've stopped.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.480
I would've...I tried to fight you off.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.656
I even gave you that scar.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.703
Just before you pinnedmy shoulders down.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.749
You remember that?No.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.967
You're remembering
it wrong.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.795
You were drunk that night.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.014
Shut up!

29:17.799 --> 29:21.542
That gaslighting crap might'veworked on me 30 years ago.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.805
But not anymore.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.764
I know the truth.

29:27.156 --> 29:30.812
Ah, and I see that you do, too.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.335
What do you want?

29:32.379 --> 29:34.163
An apology?

29:34.207 --> 29:35.991
Money?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.864
It was 30 years ago.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.822
What are you doing here?

29:43.869 --> 29:46.654
There's a woman coming.

29:46.697 --> 29:50.136
In a few days,she will ring your doorbell

29:50.179 --> 29:51.790
and ask foryour medical history,

29:51.833 --> 29:53.182
and you'll give it to her.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.837
Why would I give it to her?

29:55.881 --> 29:59.798
Because halfof her DNA is yours.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.931
After you answerall of her questions,

30:02.975 --> 30:05.934
you'll tell herthat we had a fling in college,

30:05.978 --> 30:09.590
it didn't work out
and we haven't spoken since.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.548
And thenyou'll explain to her

30:11.592 --> 30:13.942
that you have no placein your life for her.

30:13.986 --> 30:18.207
And then you will never,ever talk to her again.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.950
You won't even think about her.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.431
You got that?

30:27.216 --> 30:28.827
Good.

30:28.870 --> 30:32.265
You have no right to
tell me what to do.Sorry?

30:33.309 --> 30:34.571
If I want to talk

30:34.615 --> 30:35.964
to this woman again,
I will talk to her.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.836
She's my daughter,
too, after all.

30:37.879 --> 30:38.837
[grunts]

30:38.880 --> 30:41.535
[panting]

30:45.060 --> 30:47.846
This is a waste of time.What are we even looking for?

30:47.889 --> 30:50.936
I don't know. But you're more
than welcome to tell Gibbs

30:50.979 --> 30:53.808
you didn't think it
was worth the effort.Pass.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.593
Why do you think this case isgetting under his skin so badly?

30:56.637 --> 30:58.987
You know, I don't thinkit's the case.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.728
Torres said he heard
Gibbs and Sloane

31:00.771 --> 31:03.949
getting into something
on the stairs.Oh.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.516
Oh.You thinkthey're breaking up?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.692
Do we think they're
even dating?

31:08.736 --> 31:09.911
McGee, come on.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.565
Well, I-I didn't
even like to think

31:11.608 --> 31:13.132
about my parents
dating, okay?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.873
And Gibbs, you know,

31:14.916 --> 31:16.570
lies somewhere between
them and Ducky.

31:16.613 --> 31:17.876
Yeah, but...

31:17.919 --> 31:19.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.097
You hear that?

31:22.141 --> 31:24.621
I don't hear anything.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.797
Exactly.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.670
Where are the students?

31:44.815 --> 31:47.122
Where is the school?

31:56.871 --> 31:58.917
TORRES:
The entire school
was cleaned out.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.571
Desks, computers,even vending machines.

32:01.615 --> 32:02.877
Did you try calling?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.966
Well, nobody's answering
the phones,

32:05.010 --> 32:07.447
because there aren't any left.

32:07.490 --> 32:08.970
The website is down, too.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.972
It's like... school disappeared.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.843
Schools don't just disappear.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.367
Yeah, this has to be connected

32:14.410 --> 32:15.803
to Petty Officer Whistler's
murder.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.979
Maybe it's just
some random robbery.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.981
It wasn't a robbery.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.809
I just spoke
with a bunch of students.

32:21.852 --> 32:22.984
They saw

32:23.028 --> 32:25.160
leasing company truckspicking up

32:25.204 --> 32:27.206
equipment from the school

32:27.249 --> 32:29.425
when they showed upfor class yesterday afternoon.

32:29.469 --> 32:30.905
You get the name of the company?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.602
Yeah. I alreadyran it down.

32:32.646 --> 32:35.997
Looks like Aspire Tech hasn't
been paying their bills, so,

32:36.041 --> 32:37.042
the leasing company repossessed

32:37.085 --> 32:38.130
their stuff.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.045
Used the term"con artists."

32:40.088 --> 32:42.134
Maybe it doeshave something
to do with Whistler.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.223
But if this was one
of his cons...

32:44.266 --> 32:45.659
What's the con?

32:45.702 --> 32:47.487
I think
I have an answer to that.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.358
And you can thank Florida Man

32:49.402 --> 32:50.838
for clueing me in.

32:50.881 --> 32:51.926
Come on.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.018
Oh, come on. How can you
not know Florida Man?

32:57.062 --> 32:59.673
Kase, I got... I got no ideawhat you're talking about.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.283
Okay, forget my attempts
to socialize you.

33:01.327 --> 33:04.373
All you need to know is,
last year, I did a web search

33:04.417 --> 33:06.245
for my birthday and the
phrase "Florida Man,"

33:06.288 --> 33:08.029
and found this story.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.118
GIBBS:
"Welcome to Screw U."

33:10.162 --> 33:12.991
It's an exposé
on pop-up scam schools.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.341
GIBBS:Pop-up?

33:15.384 --> 33:17.038
Well, the concept ispretty simple.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.344
A scammer rents a space,

33:18.387 --> 33:19.954
then puts up a shingle
for a trade school,

33:19.998 --> 33:22.000
and hires a bunchof teachers. Then,

33:22.043 --> 33:24.915
they enroll as many studentsas they can, helping them

33:24.959 --> 33:28.136
apply for as many student loansas they can.

33:28.180 --> 33:31.574
Then when all that juicy
loan money comes in...

33:31.618 --> 33:33.924
They let the school go bust,
start over somewhere else.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.274
I think

33:35.317 --> 33:37.058
that's what's happening
with Aspire Tech.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.712
I've been digging
into their financials,

33:38.755 --> 33:40.322
and that place is
a house of cards.

33:40.366 --> 33:44.065
Yeah, Aspire hired real teachersand got a real school going,

33:44.109 --> 33:45.501
but it wasn't built to last.

33:45.545 --> 33:48.287
Aspire got loanson overextended lines of credit,

33:48.330 --> 33:51.551
missed mostof their payments,
and when they got an extension

33:51.594 --> 33:52.900
to hire more teachers,they hired

33:52.943 --> 33:54.815
more loan counselors instead.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.122
So when you say "they,"you mean Petty Officer Whistler?

33:57.165 --> 34:00.168
I'm not so sure he's the con man
we all thought he was.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.779
Remember that offshore accounthis bestie said he cleaned out?

34:02.823 --> 34:04.564
Mm-hmm.Well, I traced the withdrawals.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.566
He didn't steal from his bestie.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.394
Whistler used the money
to give refunds

34:08.437 --> 34:10.091
to all the people they scammed.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.267
Now, on the other hand,he was stealing credit card

34:12.311 --> 34:14.182
information
from Aspire students, so,

34:14.226 --> 34:18.012
he had to be involved somehow,
but running an actual school

34:18.056 --> 34:19.622
was sort of out
of his wheelhouse.

34:19.666 --> 34:23.104
Yeah. He had a partner.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.975
These allegations are absurd.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.934
I mean, do you even
have any proof?

34:26.977 --> 34:30.068
Uh, well, Agent McGee,
do we have any proof?

34:30.111 --> 34:33.854
Well, Agent Bishop,
uh, this is yoursignature

34:33.897 --> 34:35.638
on this loan extension.

34:35.682 --> 34:36.944
And, oh,

34:36.987 --> 34:40.904
look-- you personally
hired all the teachers.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.776
Looks like you were running
the entire operation.

34:42.819 --> 34:45.779
Okay, that's-that's justhow new schools works.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.259
Okay, my job was to...

34:47.302 --> 34:48.695
Blah, blah, blah.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.741
Your job was to
blah, blah, blah.

34:51.785 --> 34:54.918
Look, we know Aspire
Tech was a scam.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.094
And we know you
were running it.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.531
What we don't know is...

34:58.574 --> 35:02.709
why you murdered Petty
Officer Whistler.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.276
What?! No!

35:04.319 --> 35:06.669
We know he's got a habit
of ripping off his partners.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.758
Okay, you are
way off base here!

35:08.802 --> 35:11.370
He rip you off, too?I didn't kill anybody!

35:11.413 --> 35:14.982
All I was doing was-was...Just running a school.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.593
Without a single credentialthat qualifies you to be a dean.

35:17.637 --> 35:20.727
That's because
I'm not a real dean!

35:21.771 --> 35:25.166
I'm justa previously-owned car salesman.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.342
You're a used car salesman?

35:27.386 --> 35:31.259
Yeah, and, well, I also doa little acting on the side.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.261
Well, how does
a used car salesman

35:33.305 --> 35:35.045
end up running a school?

35:35.089 --> 35:37.178
[sighs]

35:37.222 --> 35:41.095
Last year, I was sending outrésumés to get a new gig,

35:41.139 --> 35:44.011
and I got contactedby this headhunter online

35:44.054 --> 35:45.621
who saidhe represented these people

35:45.665 --> 35:47.188
who were startinga new school.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.669
They were looking for someone
who knew how to sell,

35:49.712 --> 35:53.151
which, for the record, I do.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.283
Hmm.I was just supposedto be a figurehead.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.939
Show up at recruitment seminars,sign papers.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.202
I looked at itlike an acting gig.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.030
More like a scam gig.

36:03.073 --> 36:06.425
I was hired to enroll students,which I did.

36:06.468 --> 36:09.036
Everything elseis above my pay grade.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.560
Okay, well, good luck
with that in court.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.736
Of course, you know,
we could put in a good word

36:13.780 --> 36:15.260
for you with the D.A.

36:15.303 --> 36:18.001
In exchange for...?

36:18.045 --> 36:20.743
Telling us where we can find
that headhunter.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.052
[sighs]

36:25.095 --> 36:28.273
So, the GI Bill covers almost$25,000 per academic year,

36:28.316 --> 36:31.406
which is more than enough tocover your tuition and expenses.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.713
And we can even help
with all of the applications

36:33.756 --> 36:35.758
so that the money gets routed
properly.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.238
What about legal fees?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.806
'Cause I see a whole lot
of those in your future.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.330
Remember me? We met
in the computer lab.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.811
I see you found a comb,
by the way. Nice.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.770
If, uh,
you could excuse us, okay?

36:49.946 --> 36:52.471
Where are you going?

36:52.514 --> 36:54.734
I was just gonna grab a bite.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.910
Mm. Well, you might want

36:56.953 --> 36:58.738
to pick up a new belt
while you're at it.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.827
Yeah, we're gonna need
to test that one for the DNA

37:00.870 --> 37:02.481
of the guy
you strangled with it.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.573
BISHOP:
Apparently, this is

37:07.616 --> 37:09.009
the third school con

37:09.052 --> 37:10.967
our bad guy pulled off
in the last five years.

37:11.011 --> 37:14.362
So was Petty Officer Whistler
part of it or not?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.451
Not.So why is he dead?

37:16.495 --> 37:18.148
Because he uncovered it.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.325
We found a bunch of e-mails
on the bad guy's computer.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.065
Uh, looks like

37:22.109 --> 37:24.677
Whistler figured out theschool was a con pretty quickly.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.809
Never con a con man.

37:26.853 --> 37:28.594
It turns out he didn't
hack Aspire's network

37:28.637 --> 37:29.856
to steal credit cards.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.466
He was collecting evidence.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.207
Evidence for what?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.861
To blackmail the bad guy.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.559
"As long as you

37:37.603 --> 37:38.865
"keep this place running,

37:38.908 --> 37:40.562
I won't rat you out."

37:40.606 --> 37:42.216
TORRES:
So, Portland posed

37:42.260 --> 37:43.870
as a student
to find out

37:43.913 --> 37:45.350
who was blackmailing him.

37:45.393 --> 37:46.655
When he found out
it was Whistler,

37:46.699 --> 37:48.353
he killed him.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.876
Whistler's wife wasn't lying.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.834
He was trying to go legit.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.227
Better late than never.Mm.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.099
Nice work. Pass this alongto Gibbs and McGee,

37:56.143 --> 37:57.797
uh, wherever they are.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.582
We don't know
where Gibbs is,

38:00.626 --> 38:04.282
and McGee just left for his
college reunion, of all things.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.284
And I'm back.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.633
Wait. What are you doing here?

38:07.676 --> 38:09.156
Aren't you supposedto catch a plane?

38:09.199 --> 38:10.940
Yeah. Well, uh,

38:10.984 --> 38:12.768
I was about to board

38:12.812 --> 38:14.770
when I got this text.

38:16.816 --> 38:19.558
"Tim, we missed you
at the reunion."

38:19.601 --> 38:22.343
It was last night.
I messed up the date.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.345
Aah! You did not.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.304
Well, nonetheless,
welcome back, Agent McGee.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.741
Thank you, Director.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.482
Yeah, apparently, I got

38:30.525 --> 38:32.875
my potty training datesmixed up with my reunion dates.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.225
Well, that's not impressive
at all.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.880
Maybe it was better
you didn't go.

38:37.924 --> 38:41.710
Yeah, but who am I reallytrying to impress?

38:41.754 --> 38:44.844
The more I thought about it,the more I realized that

38:44.887 --> 38:47.499
I was going
for all the wrong reasons.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.196
So it's probably best

38:49.239 --> 38:51.154
that I didn't end up there
at all.

38:51.198 --> 38:55.115
Damn, son. Sounds like
I gave you the bad advice.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.030
Oh, no, you gave me
the rocking advice.

38:57.073 --> 39:00.033
No, I'm gonna save
that pep talk for a rainy day.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.606
Hey.Hey.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.477
Hey there.How you doing?Good. How are you?

39:09.521 --> 39:11.697
Good.Good to see you. Thanks.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.655
[sniffles, clears throat]

39:13.699 --> 39:17.920
So, did you get what you needed?

39:17.964 --> 39:19.835
Yeah. I did.

39:19.879 --> 39:23.230
My doctor has all the
info she wanted, and...

39:23.273 --> 39:26.755
I finally got to meet
my biological father.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.410
And... how did that go?

39:29.454 --> 39:35.068
Um, yeah, I don't know what
I was expecting, but, uh,

39:35.111 --> 39:38.071
let's just say, I don't
think he and I will be

39:38.114 --> 39:40.421
getting coffee
anytime soon. [laughs]

39:40.465 --> 39:43.119
But, um...

39:43.163 --> 39:45.948
I have a feeling that
there's more to the story

39:45.992 --> 39:49.125
maybe than
what he told me.

39:49.169 --> 39:51.389
I'm not sure what you mean.

39:51.432 --> 39:54.870
Wasn't a fling, was it?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.266
What did he say?

39:59.309 --> 40:02.965
Nothing. He didn't have to.

40:03.009 --> 40:06.969
When we talked in your office,
I-I knew something was off.

40:07.013 --> 40:11.800
The look you got on your face
when I asked about my father.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.237
I've seen it on
enough women's faces

40:14.281 --> 40:16.326
at the trauma center
at the hospital.

40:19.504 --> 40:23.116
I'm so sorry...

40:23.159 --> 40:25.510
what happened to you.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.862
Ah, I'm sorryI didn't tell you,

40:29.905 --> 40:32.734
but I want to tell youeverything now, okay?

40:32.778 --> 40:35.476
When I was pregnant,

40:35.520 --> 40:38.958
I rememberI was so scared.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.874
I was terrified that, um,

40:41.917 --> 40:43.963
maybe I couldn't...

40:44.006 --> 40:46.226
love you
because of what happened.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.751
But then you were born, and I...

40:49.795 --> 40:51.753
didn't want to let you go.

40:51.797 --> 40:55.104
But I was afraid I, um...

40:55.148 --> 40:57.106
couldn't be the mom
that you deserved.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.761
I just felt so, um...

41:01.981 --> 41:05.245
I felt so damaged.

41:06.594 --> 41:09.771
I wantedto protect you.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.034
You did.

41:13.253 --> 41:15.821
You gave me up.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.476
[cries]

41:18.519 --> 41:22.001
That was you
protecting me.

41:24.046 --> 41:26.309
Thank you.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.443
You gave me a
wonderful life. You did.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.793
[sniffles]

41:31.837 --> 41:33.534
[sighs]

41:33.578 --> 41:35.710
[cries, sniffles]
