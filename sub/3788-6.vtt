Do I look overdressed, Vince?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.870
You gotta dress like
they're pulling you out of your day.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.955
Get all suited up,
you look fucking desperate.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.458
- Is your name Vince, asshole?
- You look good, Johnny.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.376
Besides, why would you listen to a guy...

01:25.461 --> 01:27.503
who's only worn sweats
since the eighth grade?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.005

- Welcome.

Koppelman bar mitzvah is in Ballroom 3,
by the way.

- I knew it, I look desperate.
- I'm kidding, you look amazing.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.808
You're fucking old school.
Where's he going?

01:40.893 --> 01:43.561
He's going downstairs
to Adam Davies' office, third floor.

01:44.730 --> 01:48.149
Thanks a lot, Ari, I appreciate it, man.
Turtle, roll with me.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.567
- Come on.
- All right.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.610
Good luck, bro.

- It's a fucking experience.

you could not be in a better position...

The studio's interested in Vince
for either David Koresh...

03:16.613 --> 03:19.031
or the young, out-of-control FBI agent.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.701
- Director status?
- They are out to Milos Forman.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.995
Milos Forman's a genius,
you see Cuckoo's Nest?

03:24.079 --> 03:26.205
- No, I did the play in high school.
- All right.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.457
- And he was great, I saw it.
- I sucked.

Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

04:10.959 --> 04:11.959
Yeah.

When I read the e-mail
that Vincent Chase's brother...

04:16.380 --> 04:19.591
needed an agent, I assumed
it must be his younger brother.

04:19.676 --> 04:23.846
Biologically, I'm older,
but I think we play around the same age.

I'll fight for you. But I can't lie.

to get you back in the game.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.953

The John Walker Lindh story?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.559

05:11.561 --> 05:13.229
It was one idea, but it happened.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.982
Listen, I'm tired of this.
I've asked you 10 times now.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.359
Why isn't the deal for
Queens Boulevard done yet?

05:18.443 --> 05:21.404
Because there is no offer.
Why is there no offer?

05:21.488 --> 05:24.115
There's no money.
No money means it's not a real movie.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.701
Which means they're just
a bunch of words on a page.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.036
- Yeah, but they're good words.
- Great words.

05:29.121 --> 05:32.957
These scripts that you're talking about,
they could be good, and they could suck.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.210
- They could suck, Ari.
- This we know is good 'cause this we lived.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.962
You know what? E's right.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.006
We should just focus on Queens Boulevard.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.550
You know what they feed people
on an indie set, Vinny?

05:42.634 --> 05:45.845
Nothing. No trailer.
They tell you to go sit on an apple box.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.180
You ever try to bang an extra
on an apple box?

05:48.265 --> 05:51.517
- If anybody could do it, Vince could.
- I do have great balance.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.353
Look, okay. We threw out, what, 10 ideas?

05:54.438 --> 05:58.065

- Good work, E. Way to keep him on his toes.
- What did he do?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.883
He had Ari freaking.
I thought he was going to cry.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.553
I had to straighten him out a bit.
I'm tired of his bullshit all the time.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.222
- You the man!
- Johnny, how did your meeting go?

06:30.432 --> 06:33.392
Wake up, Drama.
They're asking how your meeting went.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.064

06:38.231 --> 06:40.983

the guy does nothing for you.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.583
VINCE: All right,
what are you so upset about?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.585
DRAMA: You asked him to help me
with representation.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.545
The best he can do is Adam Davies?

07:01.630 --> 07:05.257
ERIC: You serious, Drama?
VINCE: You know what, Johnny's right, E.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.761
I asked Ari to help him and he sets him up
with a glorified assistant.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.764
- I'm actually semi-upset.
- Thanks, Vince.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.391
At least you're dressed up
for tonight, Drama.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.686
- We still have to go to this thing?
- It's for Shauna, we have to go.

- What is this crap?
- He's Shauna's client, so be nice.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.330
Why, is he retarded?

07:36.498 --> 07:41.085
This piece evokes all of the emotions...

07:41.419 --> 07:44.588
from what I call a discombobulated man.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.675
This is emotional dyslexia.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.678
This is emotional confusion.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.306
And what is emotional confusion, you ask?

07:54.391 --> 07:58.060
It's like running naked
through a cornfield backwards at midnight.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.984
That was beautiful, Gary.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

08:12.200 --> 08:13.409
You know...

08:14.035 --> 08:17.079
this kind of reminds me
of Jason Pollock's early work.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.291
He employs a similar technique.
Pointillism, they call it.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.002
- TURTLE: How do you know?
- I read for Basquiat.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.422
ERIC: Nice try, Drama, but first of all
his name is Jackson Pollock...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.674
and his work was called
abstract expressionism.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.969
Pointillism's a style using points of color,
this is neither.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.014
- Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I took art history in college.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.017
- Yeah, community college, loser.
- At least I went to college.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.393
- I was working.
- Schmucks.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.644
What?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.563
Do you like the work or not?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.981
- Phenomenal.
- Fabulous.

- Johnny Drama.

- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

08:56.161 --> 08:59.997
- Good, what are you doing?
- I'm working.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.625
- Glad to have the job.
- Get out of town.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.501
Gus, I can't believe this.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.129
You were the second lead
in Cornelius and Son.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.840
- I was only a recurring.
- That was nine years ago.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.687

They're really flexible when it comes to...

09:23.772 --> 09:27.274
going on an audition, or getting a job,
a commercial or something.

to make a few extra bucks.

- Shrimp puff.

if he knew you were going...

10:43.435 --> 10:44.977
to a party at Josh Weinstein's.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.396
- Why? It's a party.
- No, you have to tell him.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.690
- If you don't tell him, I have to.
- So tell him.

You're going, too, we have plans
on Saturday night, remember?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.905

- What?

10:58.325 --> 11:01.118
- I just got offered a job.
- Nice, buddy, what's it for?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.494
Yeah, as a fucking waiter.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.872
I don't know, Drama,
that's a lot of responsibility.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.125
- Maybe you should try out busboy first.
- Eat shit, Turtle.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.502
Why don't you serve it to me, motherfucker.
Oh!

- Where am I going?
- Ivy, you're 20 minutes late.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.354
- Ari, I need to talk to you about something.
- Walk with me.

at Josh Weinstein's.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.359
- Who's Josh Weinstein?
- He's your old assistant.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.610
I have many old assistants.

Two before me, after Jackie, before Jared.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.198
My "J" phase,
I think I fired him for stealing pens.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.700
- Why do I care about Josh?
- Now he's an agent at Triad.

11:41.785 --> 11:42.743
Uh-huh.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.121
And he's the one who gave
the boys Queens Boulevard.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.541
That's why no more guys.
You fire a guy and you create a rival.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.585
You fire a woman
and you create a housewife.

You're gonna be sitting on Jack's lap.

for the Lakers on Saturday.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.816

- Who they playing?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.776
Playing the Wizards, it'll be a great game.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.237
- ERIC: Wizards.
- Fuck that, bro.

Should I be worried about this little party...

over at Josh Weinstein's house?

You want a medal or are you a coward?

When you gonna get it to him?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.117
Busey's a lunatic, you better pay him.

13:47.202 --> 13:51.038
He beat up the gaffer on Point Break
