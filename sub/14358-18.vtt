<i>(Frankie) There are</i>

<i>In Orson, that house is...</i>

00:16.688 --> 00:18.654
<i>The Donahues'.</i>

00:18.655 --> 00:21.624
Hey. Where you been?
(Door closes)

00:21.625 --> 00:23.193
The Donahues'.

00:23.194 --> 00:24.760
You're sure over there a lot.

00:24.761 --> 00:27.763
Yeah, they got a flat screen TV.
Ours is all thick and stupid.

00:27.764 --> 00:30.932
Yeah, well,
ours is all paid for.

00:30.933 --> 00:34.068
I have to do a report for school
where I interview my family.

00:34.069 --> 00:36.070
Okay. Shoot.

00:36.071 --> 00:39.106
When you were young,
what did you want to be?

00:39.107 --> 00:40.807
What were
your hopes and dreams,

00:40.808 --> 00:42.842
and how did you see it
benefiting mankind?

00:42.843 --> 00:45.044
And how close would you say
you've come

00:45.045 --> 00:46.611
to achieving those goals?

00:46.612 --> 00:54.051
Um, okay, well, Hmm.
When I was little...

00:54.052 --> 00:56.819
You wanted to work in a mine?

00:56.820 --> 00:59.321
Oh, no. Dean Martin had
this cool show,

00:59.322 --> 01:01.756
and he had these dancers
who wore go-go boots,

01:01.757 --> 01:03.758
and they were called
gold diggers,

01:03.759 --> 01:07.228
because... well,
their values weren't very good.

01:10.164 --> 01:12.865
Hi, Mr. Heck.
Hi, Mrs. Heck.

01:12.866 --> 01:15.667
O.M.G.,
it's so good to see you.

01:15.668 --> 01:17.668
Hi, Brad.
Hi, Brad.

01:17.669 --> 01:19.736
<i>Brad was Sue's ex-boyfriend.</i>
<i>She broke up with him</i>

01:19.737 --> 01:21.838
<i>after she discovered him</i>
<i>smoking.</i>

01:21.839 --> 01:24.706
<i>There might be one other thing</i>
<i>they had left to discover,</i>

01:24.707 --> 01:26.709
<i>but we weren't about</i>
<i>to tell 'em.</i>

01:26.710 --> 01:28.643
Mr. Heck,
I love your haircut.

01:28.644 --> 01:31.711
You have to give me
the name of your stylist.

01:31.712 --> 01:33.846
Uh, I go to this guy Al,

01:33.847 --> 01:36.915
and I think if I called him
a stylist, he'd punch me.

01:36.916 --> 01:39.984
Well, kudos to Al,
and kudos to you for rockin' it.

01:39.985 --> 01:41.986
Mm.

01:41.987 --> 01:44.989
Brad, why don't you go
look for the CD in my room?

01:44.990 --> 01:46.890
I'll be in in a sec.

01:46.891 --> 01:49.792
Aah! (Giggles) It's Brad.

01:49.793 --> 01:52.027
Yes, it is.
So are you two...

01:52.028 --> 01:54.728
Oh, no, no.
We're just friends now.

01:54.729 --> 01:56.130
And don't worry.

01:56.131 --> 01:58.197
His parents sent him
to a special religious camp

01:58.198 --> 02:01.533
where they cured him
of his... (Whispers) Smoking.

02:01.534 --> 02:03.769
Oh.
Oh.

02:03.770 --> 02:06.370
(Normal voice) No more urges.
(Laughs)

02:06.371 --> 02:10.639
Mom, did you want to be
anything that wasn't on TV?

02:10.640 --> 02:13.509
Oh, well,
when I was in college,

02:13.510 --> 02:16.511
I thought I might have
a career in banking or finance.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.446
I used to be good at math.

02:18.447 --> 02:20.514
But here I am,
just selling cars.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.549
Why don't you ask your dad
some questions?

02:22.550 --> 02:23.951
He's probably getting bored.

02:23.952 --> 02:25.351
No, I'm okay.

02:25.352 --> 02:27.254
Donahues'. Later.

02:27.255 --> 02:29.288
But you just got home.
Hey, you know,

02:29.289 --> 02:31.523
you and your friends can
hang out here sometimes.

02:31.524 --> 02:34.458
We have some fun stuff.
We've got most of a Jenga set.

02:34.459 --> 02:35.926
(Gasps) Jenga!

02:35.927 --> 02:38.095
I'll be back tomorrow.
Maybe Tuesday.

02:38.096 --> 02:40.629
He's always at the Donahues'.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.831
I never see him anymore.
I miss him.

02:42.832 --> 02:45.599
That's why you're the mom.
I don't.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, but, Mike,
think about it. He's 16.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.602
He's only gonna be living
here for a few more years.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.203
Well, don't worry, honey.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.571
When the outside world
gets a load of him,

02:53.572 --> 02:55.306
I think they'll send him right back.

02:55.307 --> 02:57.039
Axl's right.
This house is lame.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.780
You know,
if we had a cooler house,

02:58.781 --> 03:00.295
maybe he and his friends
would hang out here more.

03:00.296 --> 03:01.744
And that's not a bad thing,

03:01.745 --> 03:03.048
'cause we could keep our eye
on him.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.354
I mean, didn't you get
in trouble with your friends

03:05.355 --> 03:07.143
when you were his age?
(Laughs) Yeah.

03:07.144 --> 03:09.056
We got these fake ID's

03:09.057 --> 03:11.405
and took these girls
in my friend's dad's car...

03:11.406 --> 03:14.392
Dad, could you talk slower?

03:16.791 --> 03:18.622
<i>At the moment,</i>

03:18.623 --> 03:21.556
<i>about the only place lamer</i>
<i>than our house was work.</i>

03:21.557 --> 03:24.959
<i>We hadn't seen a customer</i>
<i>all day.</i>

03:24.960 --> 03:28.529
(Doorbell dings)
Hey, somebody sell me a freakin' car!

03:28.530 --> 03:30.096
Thank God.

03:30.097 --> 03:31.730
Oh.

03:31.731 --> 03:35.733
Hi. I'm Frankie.
How can I help you today?

03:35.734 --> 03:38.702
Well, Frankie, my name's Abby.
This is your lucky day.

03:38.703 --> 03:40.237
(Slurring) I'm ready to buy a car.
Sell me a car.

03:40.238 --> 03:41.771
Wow.
Y... well, I'd love to.

03:41.772 --> 03:43.823
Uh, was there any particular
car you were interested in?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.874
Yeah.
How about a red car?

03:45.875 --> 03:48.076
Okay, well,
I was thinking make or model,

03:48.077 --> 03:50.244
but we can start with color.
Oh, whoa! (Laughs)

03:50.245 --> 03:53.279
Oh. Abby did you happen to have
a few drinks this morning?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.981
I haven't had
one single drink today.

03:55.982 --> 03:59.785
Oh, my God.
You got pretty eyes.

03:59.786 --> 04:02.419
My grandmother says
they're my best feature.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.121
Abby, are you sure that
now is the best time

04:05.122 --> 04:07.190
to be shopping for a car?
You're right.

04:07.191 --> 04:09.458
I should test-drive it first.
Give me the keys.

04:09.459 --> 04:10.960
(Sighs)

04:10.961 --> 04:12.361
(Taps)

04:13.797 --> 04:16.363
I've given her
five cups of coffee.

04:16.365 --> 04:17.899
She just seems drunker.

04:17.899 --> 04:20.666
God, how horrible a person am I
to sell a drunk woman a car?

04:20.668 --> 04:22.568
Do it, you gutless wonder.
(Sighs)

04:22.569 --> 04:24.937
I'd have sold her
matching r.V.S by now.

04:24.938 --> 04:26.939
She's totally into my eyes.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.774
You think I should make my move
while she's still hammered?

04:29.775 --> 04:32.308
Ugh.

04:32.309 --> 04:34.743
Oh, is that the paperwork?
Gimme, gimme.

04:34.744 --> 04:37.745
(Sighs) I'm sorry, Abby.
I can't let you buy this car,

04:37.746 --> 04:40.547
not when you're not fully aware
of what you're doing.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.415
(Normal voice) You should've
sold me the car, Frankie.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.050
You should've made the deal.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.684
Wh-what?

04:45.685 --> 04:49.687
Yep, you screwed the pooch
on that one, Frances.

04:49.688 --> 04:52.923
Drunk customer...
the easiest sale in the book.

04:52.924 --> 04:55.124
Meet Abby Michaels,

04:55.125 --> 04:57.592
a motivational consultant
I hired

04:57.593 --> 04:59.461
to whip you losers into shape.

04:59.462 --> 05:03.097
You got your work cut out for you, Abby.
(Chuckles)

05:03.098 --> 05:05.598
I'm gonna turn off
the security cameras,

05:05.599 --> 05:07.134
and you...
Do what you gotta do.

05:07.135 --> 05:08.668
(Clicks tongue)

05:16.068 --> 05:17.568
Hey.

05:17.569 --> 05:19.570
Oh, good.
You've got your hammer out.

05:19.571 --> 05:21.105
Do me a favor?
Smack me in the head with it.

05:21.106 --> 05:22.638
I'm getting a beer.

05:22.639 --> 05:23.940
I'm guessing you would like one, too.

05:23.941 --> 05:25.240
Ugh.
Ehlert has hired

05:25.241 --> 05:26.741
this whackadoodle
motivational consultant,

05:26.742 --> 05:29.276
who for some reason
has decided to zero in on me

05:29.277 --> 05:31.145
and my terrible sales record.

05:31.146 --> 05:33.712
Or maybe
it's 'cause I'm a woman.

05:33.713 --> 05:35.614
I've got something that
might make you feel better.

05:35.615 --> 05:36.966
It's in the basement.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.316
Oh, honey, that was fun once,

05:38.317 --> 05:40.683
but that old mattress is
so icky.

05:40.684 --> 05:43.418
Get your mind out
of the gutter. Kids, come on!

05:43.419 --> 05:45.420
I want to show you something
in the basement.

05:45.421 --> 05:46.854
A pool table?

05:46.855 --> 05:49.389
Yep, and I got that weird smell
out of the mini fridge, too.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.458
Whoa! I can't believe
how awesome you guys are.

05:51.459 --> 05:53.726
Well, it's the shock
in your voice

05:53.727 --> 05:55.392
that makes it all worthwhile.

05:55.393 --> 05:56.594
You are awesome, honey.

05:56.595 --> 05:57.794
I'm not gonna argue with you.

05:57.795 --> 05:59.228
Can we afford this?

05:59.229 --> 06:01.830
Can we afford free?
(Gasps)

06:01.831 --> 06:03.415
Cheaters went out of business.

06:03.416 --> 06:04.999
Oh. Wow, the economy's bad
when the bars go under.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.868
Hey, is it okay
if I bring my friends over?

06:07.869 --> 06:10.570
Well, we were thinking
this was more of a family thing,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.170
but I-I guess if you want
to make it kind of a home base,

06:13.171 --> 06:15.005
I don't see why not.

06:15.006 --> 06:16.306
(Gasps) Ohh...

06:16.307 --> 06:18.641
Who's got the cool house now?

06:18.642 --> 06:21.410
Brick,
are you licking the chalk?

06:21.411 --> 06:23.912
I'll never eat
white chalk again.

06:25.415 --> 06:27.348
<i>So while the family was</i>
<i>having fun playing pool</i>

06:27.349 --> 06:29.616
<i>at what is now sure to be</i>
<i>the fun house,</i>

06:29.617 --> 06:31.619
<i>i was doing my damnedest</i>

06:31.620 --> 06:34.187
<i>to get out from behind</i>
<i>the eight ball at work...</i>

06:34.188 --> 06:36.521
<i>which wasn't easy,</i>

06:36.522 --> 06:37.856
<i>since Abby seemed to be</i>
focusing all her crazy on me.

06:37.857 --> 06:39.190
 Well, I see you've
been eyeing this...

06:39.191 --> 06:42.425
freeze! Bear with us. She's
in training. Okay. Go again,

06:42.426 --> 06:45.662
but this time, try using
our customer's appearance

06:45.663 --> 06:46.980
to get to his hot button issues.

06:46.981 --> 06:48.296
Hot button issues?

06:48.297 --> 06:50.365
Issues you can connect
with the customer on

06:50.366 --> 06:51.632
to gain their trust

06:51.633 --> 06:53.634
and then ultimately exploit
to make the sale.

06:53.635 --> 06:55.935
For example, if you walked
into my dealership,

06:55.936 --> 06:57.970
and I looked at your appearance,
I would think, tired,

06:57.971 --> 07:00.005
obviously doesn't care about
her appearance, must have kids.

07:00.006 --> 07:02.140
Boom! Minivan.

07:02.141 --> 07:03.574
(Sighs)

07:03.575 --> 07:05.810
It's such a smooth ride.

07:05.811 --> 07:07.345
(Singsongy) Boring!

07:07.346 --> 07:09.012
(Normal voice)
Bear with us, Rhonda.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.946
Your patter's like knocking back
a sleeping pill

07:10.947 --> 07:13.281
with a shot of scotch.
Am I right, Rhonda?

07:13.282 --> 07:15.317
No need to spare her feelings.
It's for her own good.

07:15.318 --> 07:16.768
And the gearshift...

07:16.769 --> 07:18.218
freeze!
Bear with me.

07:18.219 --> 07:19.803
The feel of the wheel seals the deal.
Say it, Frankie.

07:19.804 --> 07:21.386
The feel of the wheel...

07:21.387 --> 07:23.255
seals... the... deal.
Seals... the... deal.

07:23.256 --> 07:24.491
- Faster.
- The feel of the wheel seals the deal.

07:24.492 --> 07:25.339
Tell him.

07:25.340 --> 07:26.239
The feel of the wheel seals the deal.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.323
Resume selling.

07:28.917 --> 07:29.453
Bear with me.

07:31.177 --> 07:31.923
(Beeps)

07:32.900 --> 07:36.527
Mr. Heck, outstanding job
on the pool table.

07:36.528 --> 07:38.283
On behalf
of the whole neighborhood,

07:38.284 --> 07:38.937
thank you.

07:38.938 --> 07:40.462
You're welcome, Sean.
Glad you're having fun.

07:40.463 --> 07:42.317
Yeah, we're out of bean dip.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.342
One step ahead of you.
I made a snack run yesterday.

07:46.237 --> 07:48.562
Excellent foresight
and planning, Mr. Heck.

07:48.563 --> 07:49.822
A-one.

07:49.823 --> 07:52.742
Your dad set you up with
bean dip over at your house?

07:52.743 --> 07:54.576
No, sir, he does not.

07:55.117 --> 07:57.196
Axl, your dad rules.

07:57.197 --> 07:59.279
<i>♪</i>

07:59.280 --> 08:01.114
yes, I do.

08:01.115 --> 08:03.083
Hey, I saw Nancy Donahue
on her porch

08:03.084 --> 08:05.384
looking over at our house.
I think she's jealous.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.452
She should be.
It's pretty fun over here.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.853
Yeah.
(Sue giggles)

08:08.854 --> 08:10.586
Oh, hey, Carly

08:10.587 --> 08:13.189
I just came over
to check out the pool table.

08:13.190 --> 08:15.857
Mike, you're lucky. I'm stuck
at work with a lunatic,

08:15.858 --> 08:17.925
and you're here being
the cool dad.

08:17.926 --> 08:19.110
I wanted to be the cool parent.

08:19.111 --> 08:20.293
(Microwave beeps)

08:20.294 --> 08:23.230
Well, if you want, I can let you
take down the Pizza Rolls,

08:23.231 --> 08:25.266
could I?

08:25.267 --> 08:27.699
Yes. But you have to
let 'em know

08:27.700 --> 08:29.867
that I'm the one
who cooked 'em.

08:29.868 --> 08:32.302
Frankie.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.504
Have a seat.
I-I'm only late

08:35.505 --> 08:37.206
because some kids spent the night.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.907
(Scoffs) Relax.
Put your feet up.

08:38.908 --> 08:41.674
Uh... o-okay.

08:45.379 --> 08:47.613
Frankie, you might think
a woman like me

08:47.614 --> 08:49.413
don't understand
a woman like you.

08:49.414 --> 08:51.683
I mean, sure,
my life is glamorous...

08:51.684 --> 08:53.916
one town after the next...
Des Moines, Dayton...

08:53.917 --> 08:55.485
an expense account
at cracker barrel,

08:55.486 --> 08:57.251
uh, free "USA Todays"
with my Continental Breakfast.

08:57.252 --> 08:59.253
I mean, really,
the list goes on.

08:59.254 --> 09:01.455
But it took a lot of hard work.
Do you know what I'm saying?

09:01.456 --> 09:03.557
<i>Nope.</i>
I sure do.

09:03.558 --> 09:06.225
Then get your feet off that desk
and move some metal!

09:06.226 --> 09:08.493
Ehlert wants me to get rid
of one salesperson

09:08.494 --> 09:10.328
before the end of the week.

09:10.329 --> 09:12.464
It'd be a shame if it's you.

09:14.166 --> 09:17.667
(Lowered voice) Bob,
she's firing someone.

09:17.668 --> 09:20.669
Abby told me that Ehlert
told her to fire someone here.

09:20.670 --> 09:21.871
What?!

09:21.872 --> 09:23.071
Yeah.
And it's gotta be one of us,

09:23.072 --> 09:24.806
because Pete's the top seller.

09:24.807 --> 09:26.539
Well, it can't be me 'cause
I'm sleeping with her.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.541
What?

09:28.542 --> 09:31.144
Or it could be me
'cause I'm not all that good.

09:31.281 --> 09:33.182
<i>With me trapped at work</i>
<i>with Looney Tunes,</i>

09:33.183 --> 09:34.716
<i>Mike was beginning to think</i>

09:34.717 --> 09:36.718
<i>the fun house wasn't</i>
<i>all that fun for him.</i>

09:36.719 --> 09:38.536
Mr. Heck, please, let
us help you with that.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.353
Thanks, guys.
(Clears throat)

09:40.354 --> 09:42.355
(Sets keys on counter)

09:43.477 --> 09:45.510
Hey, th-there's raw chicken
in there.

09:45.511 --> 09:47.878
Eh, never mind.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.146
Animals.

09:50.147 --> 09:53.882
"Question 17... now that
you're the mom of the house"...

09:53.883 --> 09:55.351
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:55.352 --> 09:57.887
I'm not the mom of anything.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.389
You got chalk on your face.
Come here.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.927
Go to your room.

10:04.928 --> 10:09.031
(Sighs)

10:09.032 --> 10:11.668
Oh, hey, Brad.
How's it going?

10:11.669 --> 10:14.504
Good. Good.

10:14.505 --> 10:17.307
I think Sue and Carly are
downstairs.

10:17.308 --> 10:19.509
Oh, yeah, I know.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.946
Mr. Heck, can I ask you
a question,

10:21.947 --> 10:24.414
you know, man to man?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.683
Sure.

10:26.684 --> 10:29.585
Well, Mr. Heck,
I guess I'm confused

10:29.586 --> 10:31.688
about certain feelings
I've been having.

10:31.689 --> 10:34.157
Brad, I'm not sure

10:34.158 --> 10:35.526
I'm the person you want
to talk to about this.

10:35.527 --> 10:36.893
You see...

10:36.894 --> 10:38.928
there's your parents,
your minister,

10:38.929 --> 10:40.362
lots of people, really.

10:40.363 --> 10:43.866
See, when e and I were dating,
it was really fun, you know,

10:43.867 --> 10:45.801
but we both sensed
something was missing.

10:45.802 --> 10:48.370
Well, mostly I did, I guess.
Mm-hmm.

10:48.371 --> 10:51.006
And now I've been having
these new feelings,

10:51.007 --> 10:53.008
<i>very</i> intense feelings.

10:53.009 --> 10:55.110
But I'm afraid
if I act on them,

10:55.111 --> 10:58.046
it might be surprising and might
hurt people I care about.

10:58.047 --> 11:00.449
Oh. I don't know
if it'll be as surprising

11:00.450 --> 11:02.452
as you think it will.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.121
People kind of sense things
about people, in my experience.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.422
Good talk.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.025
I'm just so conflicted.
(Sighs)

11:10.026 --> 11:12.361
It's like...
I don't know which end is up.

11:12.362 --> 11:14.163
What do I do?

11:15.732 --> 11:18.834
I think you follow your gut.

11:18.835 --> 11:21.437
If you make a decision
by following your gut,

11:21.438 --> 11:24.339
it can't be bad, right?

11:24.340 --> 11:27.409
Can we be done?

11:27.410 --> 11:28.844
(Mouths word)

11:30.313 --> 11:32.682
Frankie.
Abby's been looking for you.

11:32.683 --> 11:34.750
She's in the service center.

11:34.751 --> 11:36.252
Since someone's getting fired,

11:36.253 --> 11:38.520
I'll just take
this opportunity to say...

11:38.521 --> 11:40.789
I think it's you.

11:44.793 --> 11:48.998
You're always running from
conflict, aren't you, Frankie?

11:48.999 --> 11:51.634
That's your style...
avoid and retreat.

11:51.635 --> 11:53.103
Oh, that's not true.

11:53.104 --> 11:56.038
I run toward conflict,
usually, right smack into it.

11:56.039 --> 11:59.041
Attack and collide...
that's my style, actually.

11:59.042 --> 12:00.977
Oh, good. Glad to hear it.

12:00.978 --> 12:03.084
Then you won't have a problem
deciding who gets the boot.

12:03.919 --> 12:04.274
What?

12:04.275 --> 12:06.315
Show me what you're made of,
Frankie.

12:06.316 --> 12:08.383
I'll fire
whoever you tell me to.

12:08.384 --> 12:10.385
You've got 24 hours
to give me a name.

12:10.386 --> 12:11.887
I'm off in the morning.

12:11.888 --> 12:14.656
There's a struggling video store
in Topeka that needs my help.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.331
Thank you.

12:22.332 --> 12:25.800
Yeah, they're easier to pick up
when they're in little pieces.

12:27.436 --> 12:29.205
Why did you tell Brad to

12:29.206 --> 12:30.973
- go out with Carly?
- What?

12:30.974 --> 12:32.975
He said you told him
to follow his gut,

12:32.976 --> 12:35.810
and now he asked her out
on a date to the pie house

12:35.811 --> 12:37.880
Friday night,
in their own booth!

12:37.881 --> 12:41.017
His parents are gonna walk
the mall until they're done.

12:41.018 --> 12:43.819
Carly? That's not what I thought
we were talking about.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.689
What did you think you
were talking about?

12:45.690 --> 12:47.557
Uh...

12:47.558 --> 12:50.593
Hey! Mom's home.

12:50.594 --> 12:53.895
Dad told Brad to date Carly
instead of me.

12:53.896 --> 12:57.465
And I'll let him tell you
about the pie house.

12:57.466 --> 13:00.537
Why would you do that?
You know she likes him.

13:00.538 --> 13:02.505
Do I?
I don't know anything.

13:02.506 --> 13:04.774
I got kids running around
all over the place.

13:04.775 --> 13:06.776
You're not here.

13:06.777 --> 13:08.878
Seriously? Carly?

13:08.879 --> 13:10.780
I would love to be here.

13:10.781 --> 13:13.283
I'm at work
dealing with this nut bag,

13:13.284 --> 13:15.069
and now she wants me to
pick somebody to fire.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.853
Well, then fire Pete.

13:16.854 --> 13:19.955
Then get back here and help me
clean these chips off the floor.

13:19.956 --> 13:21.690
Hey.

13:21.691 --> 13:23.391
<i>It wasn't that easy.</i>

13:23.392 --> 13:25.428
<i>I was faced</i>
<i>with an impossible choice,</i>

13:25.429 --> 13:27.429
<i>and the clock was ticking.</i>

13:27.430 --> 13:29.398
<i>It was like</i>
<i>my own reality show...</i>

13:29.399 --> 13:31.266
<i>not the one where people</i>

13:31.267 --> 13:33.436
<i>have to eat live spiders</i>
<i>or something.</i>

13:33.437 --> 13:35.938
<i>That would actually be more fun</i>
<i>than this.</i>

13:35.939 --> 13:38.439
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>i did have my final answer.</i>

13:38.680 --> 13:39.962
Fire me.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:51.487 --> 13:52.730
Oh, no!

13:55.327 --> 13:58.349
Hey, Brad. Listen,
yesterday when we had our talk,

13:58.350 --> 14:00.448
I might have given you
some wrong advice.

14:00.449 --> 14:03.018
You told me to follow my gut.
How could that be wrong?

14:03.019 --> 14:04.348
Ah!
It was so freeing.

14:04.349 --> 14:05.927
Yeah, well,

14:05.928 --> 14:07.711
I don't think I really knew
what we were talking about.

14:07.712 --> 14:09.846
What'd you think we were talking about?

14:09.881 --> 14:11.314
That's not important.

14:11.349 --> 14:13.384
The thing is, Sue's crushed,

14:13.418 --> 14:15.352
so what I meant to say was,

14:15.386 --> 14:19.323
if you're choosing
between two girls, pick Sue.

14:19.357 --> 14:22.259
(Indistinct conversations)

14:22.293 --> 14:24.328
Everyone else has been
at the dealership

14:24.363 --> 14:25.730
longer than me.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.800
I have the worst sales record.
So... (Sighs) Fire me.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.202
What does this say, Frankie?

14:33.172 --> 14:35.273
"Fire me."

14:35.307 --> 14:37.875
That's right. I wrote down
what I knew you would say.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.845
That's why I made up this whole
charade of someone being fired,

14:40.879 --> 14:43.614
to show you
how you don't value yourself.

14:43.649 --> 14:46.552
Wait a minute.
Ehlert's not firing anybody?

14:46.585 --> 14:48.888
You made it up?

14:48.921 --> 14:51.123
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.893
I have been in agony!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.995
You are crackers, lady.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.930
Or am I?

14:58.965 --> 15:01.233
If I hadn't brought you
to this point,

15:01.269 --> 15:04.135
would you have been open enough
to hear what I'm about to say?

15:04.170 --> 15:06.138
I don't know.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.506
Maybe.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.576
I know you. See, you've got
this tape playing in your head...

15:10.611 --> 15:13.679
"oh, I'm just a person
who didn't finish college.

15:13.714 --> 15:16.149
I'm just a mom."

15:16.183 --> 15:18.284
Let go of the "justs," Frankie.

15:18.319 --> 15:20.085
Just let 'em go.

15:20.121 --> 15:23.389
Empower yourself to be
who you want to be

15:23.424 --> 15:25.158
and love that person.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.193
Okay.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.295
'Cause right now you're living
paycheck to paycheck.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.298
And the sad thing is,
you're working really hard.

15:33.334 --> 15:34.969
(Whispers) I am.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.303
I'm working really hard.

15:37.338 --> 15:39.338
I know. You have a choice.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.374
You can say... (Flatly)
"I get up every morning.

15:41.409 --> 15:43.576
"I deal with a mean boss.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.378
The economy sucks,
and no one's buying cars."

15:46.413 --> 15:47.813
Or you can say...

15:47.847 --> 15:49.882
(Brightly)
"I get up every morning.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.817
"I deal with a mean boss.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.753
"The economy sucks,
and no one's buying cars.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.722
"But that's what gets me up
in the morning,

15:56.757 --> 15:58.757
"because I am Frankie Heck,
and I can do it all.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.726
"I get my family dressed
and fed

16:00.760 --> 16:03.195
"and send my kid off to school
with his science fair volcano,

16:03.230 --> 16:05.699
"and I find the missing car keys
in the Lego fort, and then

16:05.732 --> 16:07.833
"I get the Pop-tart stain
out of the football jersey.

16:07.868 --> 16:10.169
"I walk in the door
of the dealership.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.003
"Pow! Bring it on!

16:12.039 --> 16:14.673
"I can sell ten cars today.
I'm not scared.

16:14.708 --> 16:18.477
I'm a mom.
I can do <i>anything!"</i>

16:18.511 --> 16:21.913
I <i>can.</i> I can do anything.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.282
<i>Wow. She's good.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:25.351
<i>She's, like,</i>
<i>the woman whisperer.</i>

16:25.385 --> 16:28.020
I've seen this.
The chick's a dude.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.855
Really?

16:29.889 --> 16:32.290
Who are you?
Logan.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.159
How you know Axl?

16:34.193 --> 16:35.527
Who's Axl?

16:35.561 --> 16:38.797
<i>(Woman and man speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly on TV)</i>

16:45.805 --> 16:48.874
(Brad) S, do you think
we could talk for a minute?

16:48.909 --> 16:51.778
I feel really bad
about how things turned out

16:51.812 --> 16:54.247
with you and me and Carly.
(Sue) Me, too.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.899
I want to make sure
we're still friends.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.517
Yeah, we're friends.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.887
Because I talked to your dad...

17:00.921 --> 17:02.120
Oh, no!

17:02.121 --> 17:04.557
And he said you were crushed.
What?

17:04.590 --> 17:05.991
(Rapid footsteps approaching)

17:06.026 --> 17:07.826
(Whispers) Sorry.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.694
Dad.

17:09.730 --> 17:13.332
You told Brad I was crushed?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.318
I was just trying to help.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.270
Hey, dad? My interview
report is due tomorrow,

17:17.304 --> 17:19.506
and you still
haven't checked it.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.907
(Whispers) Checked it.
I'm sure it's fine.

17:21.943 --> 17:23.976
Why were you even talking
to my ex-boyfriend?

17:24.010 --> 17:25.877
You didn't even look at it.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.680
He didn't give me a choice.
Mom always checks it.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.683
Well, mom's not here.

17:30.684 --> 17:32.651
Why can't you just leave us all alone?!

17:32.685 --> 17:34.286
You got it!

17:52.606 --> 17:54.540
What are you doing?

17:54.575 --> 17:56.476
(Mouth full) I ordered pizza.

17:56.510 --> 17:59.145
Get in and shut the door
before the kids smell food.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.213
Okay, so guess what?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.015
I'm not fired.

18:03.050 --> 18:06.285
And not only that, but Abby
thinks I have potential.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.686
Yeah.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.655
My problem is I have been
undervaluing myself.

18:09.723 --> 18:12.725
There's no reason I couldn't
be selling ten cars a day

18:12.760 --> 18:15.162
if I wanted to.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.129
Well, ah, not... not maybe ten,

18:17.163 --> 18:18.831
but five at least.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.099
It's about my attitude.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.737
I just have to get up and say,
"yes! I get to get up early

18:24.770 --> 18:26.804
"and... and make
everybody's lunches

18:26.838 --> 18:29.641
"and look for the car keys,

18:29.675 --> 18:32.076
"and bust my butt
to get to work,

18:32.110 --> 18:33.511
where nobody's buying cars."

18:33.545 --> 18:35.846
I'm not saying it
as good as she does,

18:35.881 --> 18:40.183
but, look, there's something
about Lego cleaning.

18:40.217 --> 18:42.919
A "pow" in there.

18:42.954 --> 18:45.421
God, it seemed to make
so much sense before.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.492
Not it just sounds like
it's gonna take a lot of energy.

18:49.527 --> 18:52.495
Maybe I should just try
to get to work on time.

18:52.529 --> 18:54.464
I just want
to get back to work, period.

18:54.499 --> 18:56.499
I'm not cut out for this,
Frankie...

18:56.534 --> 18:58.535
entertaining teenagers, getting
sucked into their drama,

18:58.569 --> 19:00.203
checking Brick's homework.

19:00.237 --> 19:03.441
<i>Actually, Mike really should</i>
<i>have checked Brick's homework.</i>

19:03.474 --> 19:05.409
"My mom wanted to be
a gold digger.

19:05.443 --> 19:08.412
My dad didn't think my brother
was playing enough pool."

19:08.446 --> 19:10.814
The end.

19:10.848 --> 19:12.816
I need them
to reopen the quarry.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.819
I need them to reopen it now.

19:14.852 --> 19:17.521
I miss my trailer.
I miss my desk.

19:17.555 --> 19:20.124
Around here, I don't get
a minute of peace.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.059
You could say it that way,
Mike, or you could say...

19:22.094 --> 19:23.545
(Brightly) I don't get
a minute of peace.

19:23.546 --> 19:24.996
Hmm.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.899
Ohh. Come on inside. Didn't
you hear? We're the fun house.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.901
No. This is my room now.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.903
I've had enough
of the fun house.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.873
I tried to make you happy,
but I'm done with that.

19:35.907 --> 19:38.509
I'm sorry. I thought
it would be more fun.

19:38.544 --> 19:41.045
Let's just ship 'em all back
to the Donahues'.

19:41.079 --> 19:44.248
Good luck. We're out of food,
and they still won't leave.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.986
I say we flood the basement.
Asps) I have a better idea.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.488
(Billiard balls clack)

19:50.522 --> 19:52.489
Mr. Heck,
can I talk to you?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.824
Absolutely not.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.661
Oh. I've decided to take a break
from girls for a while.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.696
Probably wise,
until you figure things out.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.264
Good luck.

20:05.303 --> 20:07.571
Whoa! Party foul.
What are you doing down here?

20:07.605 --> 20:10.107
Oh, we just thought
we'd check out the "haps,"

20:10.142 --> 20:13.177
see what's going on down here.

a little disheartening.
