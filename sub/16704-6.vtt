00:20.321 --> 00:21.855
Bob!

00:21.923 --> 00:23.624
Hey! Whoo!

00:23.692 --> 00:26.293
Bob! Hey,
I think you missed a spot!

00:26.360 --> 00:29.029
Oh, never mind.
That's just your mustache!

00:29.097 --> 00:31.265
Ka-boom!

00:31.332 --> 00:33.434
Ha-ha. Ha-ha,
Jimmy! Good one.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.720
Uh, at least I could grow one.
You can't!

00:36.788 --> 00:39.139
Gene? Louise?
How about a "ka-boom"?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.709
You can do better than that, dad.
Yeah, step it up.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.777
Okay, you do better.
Give me something.

00:43.845 --> 00:45.729
How about, I don't know...

00:45.797 --> 00:49.216
Nice shoes, Jimmy. Do they
make them for men, too? Ha!

00:49.284 --> 00:51.802
That's, uh... that's good.
Hey, Ji...

00:51.870 --> 00:53.470
Oh. They're gone.

00:53.538 --> 00:55.439
God, I hate Jimmy Pesto

00:55.507 --> 00:58.859
with his crappy food and
all his... customers.

00:58.927 --> 01:00.928
Oh, forget about your silly
rivalry for one minute.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.429
Bob, listen, come here.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.981
Tina's birthday's coming up,

01:04.048 --> 01:05.582
and I think we should
do something special

01:05.650 --> 01:07.050
since she's turning 13.

01:07.118 --> 01:08.886
This is the year
she becomes a woman.

01:08.953 --> 01:10.337
Yeah, I don't want
to hear this.

01:10.405 --> 01:12.606
Bob, she deserves
a special party this year.

01:12.674 --> 01:14.491
If what it says in
her diary is true,

01:14.559 --> 01:16.477
then I'd say she
needs it. A lot.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.895
It's true.

01:17.962 --> 01:19.430
Wait. You read her diary?

01:19.497 --> 01:21.181
Yeah.
What I can stomach.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.250
I just skim it to make sure
she's not on drugs.

01:23.318 --> 01:24.518
What... what does it say?

01:24.586 --> 01:25.886
It says, "I'm not on drugs."

01:25.954 --> 01:27.688
It's pretty rough.

01:27.756 --> 01:30.090
But she thinks things will
really turn around this year.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.259
Yeah, she dubbed it
the "year of Tina."

01:32.327 --> 01:34.328
Why is everyone
reading her diary?

01:34.395 --> 01:37.214
It's well-written.
She's better on the page than in person.

01:37.282 --> 01:38.799
And what if the Nazis get us,

01:38.867 --> 01:40.868
and it's all we have
of our family?

01:40.935 --> 01:44.455
Okay, fine. We'll make this
birthday extra-special.

01:44.522 --> 01:48.125
All right.
Tina, sweetie, come here. Yeah?

01:48.193 --> 01:50.093
Listen, baby,
we'd like you to have

01:50.161 --> 01:52.463
and extra-special
13th birthday party.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.981
So take your time,
and think about

01:54.048 --> 01:55.933
what would make
the perfect party.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.351
I'd like it to be
a boy-girl party.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.403
Mm-hmm. Mm.
With mingling.

01:59.471 --> 02:02.055
I want to close the restaurant
and invite my whole class over.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.924
No.
And I want there to be a dj,

02:03.992 --> 02:05.993
and dancing, and a
smoke machine, mmm-mm.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.394
And about two hours
into the party,

02:07.462 --> 02:09.096
I want there to be a moment

02:09.163 --> 02:11.298
where I see Jimmy Jr.
Across the room hmm.

02:11.366 --> 02:12.599
And we're pulled
toward each other.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.434
Mmm-mm.
We meet under the disco ball,

02:14.502 --> 02:17.037
mm. And we kiss until our
bodies and souls become one.

02:17.105 --> 02:18.505
Oh, God.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.207
And it's my first kiss.
Mm.

02:20.275 --> 02:22.643
And it's perfect,
and I remember it forever.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.978
Freak.
Scary.

02:25.046 --> 02:27.548
Wow. You've really put
some thought into it.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.250
That, uh, sounds expensive.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.786
And I could do without the
kissing Pesto's kid part.

02:32.854 --> 02:35.956
Oh. It's okay, I guess I wasn't
meant to have a good life.

02:36.024 --> 02:37.558
Bob, a word?
Now?

02:37.625 --> 02:38.759
Not now.
Now.

02:38.827 --> 02:40.010
All right.

02:40.078 --> 02:42.145
You want to kiss
Jimmy Pesto Jr.?

02:42.213 --> 02:44.081
Yes. A lot.
Many times.

02:44.148 --> 02:46.817
I can help you. I'll be
your kissing coordinator.

02:46.885 --> 02:48.819
It's my birthday
present to you.

02:48.887 --> 02:50.454
Yeah, I think
I know how to kiss.

02:50.522 --> 02:53.757
Ow! Do ya?
You think you know how to kiss?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.692
You know how to lock lips, huh?
Do ya? Ow!

02:55.760 --> 02:58.362
You think you know what it feels
like to kiss a man, Tina?!

02:58.429 --> 03:00.364
If you don't know what
you're doing out there,

03:00.431 --> 03:03.000
you could get yourself killed.
Or worse! Ow, ow!

03:03.067 --> 03:04.768
STDS, Tina,
have you heard of them?

03:04.836 --> 03:06.820
Have you heard of herpes?
Have you? Yes. Yes.

03:06.888 --> 03:08.956
Do you know what herpes feels
like on your mouth? Yes.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.174
What? What is it? What?

03:11.242 --> 03:13.644
Like, um, cuts on your mouth.

03:13.711 --> 03:15.012
That sounds right.

03:15.079 --> 03:16.947
Sla... I'm gonna slap gene.
Ow!

03:17.015 --> 03:19.366
Closing down the restaurant,
getting a smoke machine,

03:19.417 --> 03:21.301
and a dj? That's
gonna add up.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.220
We have nothing extra
this month, lin.

03:23.288 --> 03:24.788
Well, we got
to do what we got to do.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.056
Look at her.

03:26.124 --> 03:27.291
She's so awkward.

03:27.358 --> 03:29.142
She's a good girl.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.545
Okay. I'll talk
to Fischoeder

03:31.613 --> 03:33.280
about getting
an extension on the rent.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.950
It's foggy.

03:37.018 --> 03:38.552
Yes, it is.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.120
Are you there?
I am.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.440
Why are we here in the fog?

03:43.508 --> 03:45.893
I-I wanted to meet you,

03:45.960 --> 03:47.311
and then you told me
to meet you here.

03:47.378 --> 03:48.629
Oh, that's right.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.948
It was a good idea.
I love the fog.

03:51.015 --> 03:52.883
Listen, Mr. Fischoeder,
I know we talked

03:52.951 --> 03:54.384
about never doing this again,

03:54.452 --> 03:56.286
but if you can just give us
two extra weeks

03:56.354 --> 03:58.071
this month on the rent...

03:58.122 --> 04:00.574
I'm going to have to stop
you right there, Bob.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.912
Were-were you going to follow
that up with anything?

04:04.979 --> 04:07.180
No.
Oh.

04:07.248 --> 04:10.417
Oh, I love the way
the fog feels under my cape.

04:10.485 --> 04:12.753
Uh, right. I'll get going.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.354
Bob, listen. What do
you think of this?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.572
What if I don't give you
an extension on your rent,

04:16.641 --> 04:18.909
but I do give you
the opportunity

04:18.976 --> 04:22.913
to earn some extra money
in one of my side businesses?

04:22.981 --> 04:25.215
That sounds...
Sketchy.

04:25.283 --> 04:26.917
Oh, it is, Bob.
Oh.

04:26.985 --> 04:28.251
But you get to wear this hat.

04:29.454 --> 04:30.704
So, for the next week,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.839
I'll be driving a taxicab

04:32.907 --> 04:34.324
to pay for Tina's party.

04:34.392 --> 04:35.776
And I'll be wearing this hat.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.161
Cool! Cool!
Cool hat or job?

04:38.229 --> 04:39.663
Job. Hat.
Thank you, dad.

04:39.731 --> 04:41.231
This party is gonna sizzle.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.834
Stop it.

04:43.918 --> 04:45.335
Wait, wait.
Bob, Bobby. Yes?

04:45.403 --> 04:46.870
When are you going to
have time to drive a cab?

04:46.938 --> 04:48.922
Well, I'll work the full
day at the restaurant, lin,

04:48.973 --> 04:50.207
then I'll go drive the cab

04:50.274 --> 04:51.875
from 10:00 P.M.
To 6:00 A.M.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.810
Aww, Bob.

04:53.895 --> 04:55.612
All right, all right.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.713
Wait. Why do you have
to wear a hat?

04:56.781 --> 04:58.265
Just let this be fun for me.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.133
Dad, you won't regret this.

05:00.201 --> 05:02.202
When I kiss Jimmy Jr.
Under the disco ball,

05:02.270 --> 05:04.271
it'll be like we're all
kissing Jimmy Jr.

05:04.339 --> 05:06.440
Under the disco ball.
I call first.

05:06.491 --> 05:08.308
Really?
Well, if I'm gonna kiss him,

05:08.376 --> 05:10.110
I don't want to
go after you guys.

05:10.178 --> 05:11.712
I'll go last. I'm
fine with that.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.580
We're not kissing Jimmy Jr.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.982
Yes, we are!

05:18.440 --> 05:20.441
That's ten pieces of gum, Tina.

05:20.509 --> 05:21.959
Chew! Chew!

05:22.027 --> 05:24.312
A kiss is like
a fight with mouths.

05:24.379 --> 05:26.114
And... time.

05:26.181 --> 05:27.565
Spit.

05:27.633 --> 05:29.133
I'm going to destroy this kiss.

05:30.486 --> 05:32.603
Ow!
Not yet.

05:32.671 --> 05:34.822
There's my
Johnny two-jobs.

05:34.890 --> 05:37.425
Making money for the
dream birthday party.

05:37.493 --> 05:38.426
Okay.

05:38.494 --> 05:40.061
Off into the night I go.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.662
Bobby, be safe out there.

05:41.730 --> 05:43.731
And make chitchat.
You'll get more tips.

05:43.799 --> 05:45.133
Yeah, and keep
the meter running.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.667
Watch out for pukers.

05:46.735 --> 05:48.469
And stay away from route one.

05:48.537 --> 05:50.004
It's bumper-to-bumper
all the way to the interstate.

05:50.072 --> 05:51.706
Tina, how did you know that?

05:51.773 --> 05:53.741
I like traffic updates.
Why?

05:53.809 --> 05:56.344
I like when they say
"bumper-to-bumper."

05:56.411 --> 05:57.545
"Bumper-to-bumper"?

05:58.714 --> 06:01.115
Yeah. Uh, bye.

06:06.321 --> 06:08.689
Stupid beaded seat cover.

06:08.757 --> 06:11.642
Ooh, okay.

06:11.710 --> 06:12.777
I get it.

06:15.314 --> 06:17.815
Fm. Nice.

06:26.925 --> 06:29.460
Hey, guess what?
You're my first fare.

06:29.528 --> 06:30.628
Oh, no!

06:30.696 --> 06:32.196
No. Oh.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.611
Uh, where to, ladies?

07:03.679 --> 07:04.829
Fourth and ocean, doll.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.364
Thanks for stopping.

07:06.448 --> 07:08.199
Most cabbies are too prudish
to pick us up.

07:09.701 --> 07:11.135
And, uh, that's
because you are...?

07:14.656 --> 07:16.007
Fabulous!

07:16.091 --> 07:17.341
That's true.

07:17.426 --> 07:18.492
Well...

07:18.543 --> 07:19.911
You're clearly fabulous.

07:19.978 --> 07:20.928
Yeah.
Yes.

07:20.996 --> 07:22.096
Hey, eyes on the road, mister.

07:22.163 --> 07:23.514
Yeah, stop staring at us.

07:23.582 --> 07:25.016
This ain't no library.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.300
Don't fall in love,
Mr. cabdriver.

07:26.351 --> 07:27.668
You can't afford us.

07:27.719 --> 07:29.403
Hey, who's picking up who here?

07:31.506 --> 07:33.808
Hey. Don't worry, ladies.
I'm-I'm kidding.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.142
I'm, uh, I'm a married man.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.560
So am I.

07:39.615 --> 07:42.550
Now, Tina, anyone can tie a
cherry stem with their tongue.

07:42.618 --> 07:44.785
Let's see what you can do
with this banana peel.

07:44.853 --> 07:46.203
Get-get it in there.

07:47.789 --> 07:50.491
Bobby! Good morning.
You're home.

07:50.559 --> 07:52.760
Yeah. Guess who
learned a lot

07:52.828 --> 07:54.612
about transvestites last night.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.648
I was only on that web site
for, like, two seconds.

07:57.716 --> 07:59.517
What? No. I was
talking about me.

07:59.584 --> 08:01.252
I picked up a group
of transvestite hookers

08:01.320 --> 08:02.553
who showed me

08:02.621 --> 08:04.622
a side of this town
I never knew existed.

08:04.690 --> 08:07.058
And, gene, you're banned from
the computer for two days.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.193
After what I saw,
I'm-I'm fine with that.

08:09.261 --> 08:11.128
What's a transvestite hooker?

08:11.196 --> 08:12.813
Bob, I'm not sure
this is appropriate

08:12.881 --> 08:14.298
breakfast conversation.

08:14.366 --> 08:15.733
I guess you're right.

08:15.801 --> 08:17.969
Maybe I should just
try and go to sleep.

08:20.005 --> 08:22.239
Gene, honey, I think
he's sleeping.

08:22.307 --> 08:23.908
I have to go to school.

08:23.976 --> 08:25.543
Shh, shh. Just
hold still.

08:25.610 --> 08:28.045
Ew. Is this
drool or sweat?

08:28.113 --> 08:30.781
It's both. Your father
is a very moist sleeper.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.417
Aw, look at my two boys.

08:33.501 --> 08:34.452
Nice.

08:34.519 --> 08:35.820
Oh, a bow.

08:35.886 --> 08:38.072
Let's put that on dad's head.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.789
There's your transvestite.

08:39.857 --> 08:41.241
Get the camera.

08:44.011 --> 08:45.880
I'm having a birthday
party this Saturday.

08:45.947 --> 08:47.248
It's co-ed.

08:47.316 --> 08:48.649
Because I'm becoming a woman.

08:48.717 --> 08:49.633
Co-ed?

08:49.701 --> 08:51.302
My hands just got clammy.

08:51.386 --> 08:53.871
Hey, Jimmy Jr.
Hi, Tina.

08:53.939 --> 08:56.340
This is an invitation
to my birthday party.

08:56.408 --> 08:59.794
Hey, I notice you haven't
RSVP'd to my party yet.

08:59.861 --> 09:02.196
Um, I need to ask my
dad for permission.

09:02.263 --> 09:03.831
Can I let you know later?

09:03.899 --> 09:05.099
Sure, okay.

09:06.267 --> 09:08.152
Butt.

09:13.775 --> 09:17.795
♪ Across 110th street ♪

09:17.879 --> 09:21.799

09:36.331 --> 09:37.898
Oh, how you holding up, Bob?

09:37.966 --> 09:40.134
Good. I mean, I'm tired.

09:40.202 --> 09:43.037
And, um, I might be a pimp.

09:43.105 --> 09:44.705
You're gonna need a bigger hat.

09:44.773 --> 09:46.407
Well, you're still
father of the year. Hmm.

09:46.475 --> 09:48.359
Tina's party's
gonna be amazing.

09:48.443 --> 09:50.277
I got a disco ball

09:50.345 --> 09:51.829
and streamers.

09:51.913 --> 09:53.381
It's gonna be
like Buckingham Palace.

09:53.448 --> 09:55.800
Yeah, yeah.
Studio 54.

09:55.867 --> 09:58.119
Those are two
very different examples.

09:58.186 --> 10:00.755
Well, you get the idea.
You know. It's a party.

10:00.822 --> 10:02.490
So, is Tina happy?

10:02.557 --> 10:05.359
Uh, she'll be happier
once Jimmy Jr. RSVPs.

10:05.427 --> 10:07.528
She's over at Pesto's right
now to see if he'll come.

10:07.596 --> 10:09.130
I told her to show some skin.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.567
So, how'd it go?

10:13.635 --> 10:16.387
Jimmy Jr. isn't coming
to my birthday party

10:16.471 --> 10:17.671
even though he wants to

10:17.722 --> 10:18.989
because his dad won't let him.

10:19.057 --> 10:20.825
All because our dads
hate each other.

10:20.892 --> 10:22.593
Oh. Sorry, Tina.

10:22.661 --> 10:25.196
I'll never know how soft
Jimmy Jr.'s lips are.

10:25.263 --> 10:27.098
My guess is,
they're pretty soft.

10:27.165 --> 10:28.299
Like, a...

10:28.366 --> 10:30.267
Like a Kitty cat's tummy.

10:30.335 --> 10:32.470
Gene, stop.
Without Jimmy Jr.,

10:32.537 --> 10:35.239
I don't want to have a party.

10:35.307 --> 10:37.341
Hey. Your father's
been working very hard

10:37.409 --> 10:39.009
for this party, young lady.

10:39.077 --> 10:40.911
It's going to happen.

10:40.996 --> 10:42.863
Right, Bob?

10:44.433 --> 10:46.233
I'll refrost it.
It's still good.

10:46.301 --> 10:47.334
Mmm. Oh, it's
delicious.

10:52.457 --> 10:54.892
Tina, honey, your father's been
working his you-know-what off,

10:54.960 --> 10:56.494
driving a cab to pay for this.

10:56.561 --> 10:57.862
Yeah, and we've rented
the smoke machine,

10:57.929 --> 11:00.398
so this party
is definitely happening.

11:00.465 --> 11:01.799
You've been working
your you-know-what off?

11:01.867 --> 11:03.701
I've been working my ass off!

11:03.769 --> 11:05.369
Night and day training!

11:05.437 --> 11:07.238
Louise, take it easy.

11:07.306 --> 11:09.974
Do you know what she was like
when I started working with her?

11:10.042 --> 11:12.443
She was a sick joke!
Now look at her!

11:12.511 --> 11:14.662
Incoming.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.297
Bob, you gotta go talk some
sense into Jimmy Pesto.

11:16.365 --> 11:17.498
This isn't fair.

11:17.549 --> 11:18.616
Fine.

11:20.085 --> 11:21.919
Uh, hey, Bob.

11:21.987 --> 11:23.521
You look like crap.
Nice.

11:23.588 --> 11:25.439
Yeah, that was funny.

11:25.507 --> 11:27.441
Look, Jimmy,
my daughter Tina said

11:27.509 --> 11:30.061
that Jimmy Jr. isn't allowed
to go to her birthday party.

11:30.128 --> 11:32.279
Whatever issues we have
shouldn't matter.

11:32.347 --> 11:34.415
Just please let Jimmy Jr. go.

11:34.483 --> 11:36.033
Okay. Okay.

11:36.118 --> 11:37.468
You know it's going
to cost you, right?

11:37.536 --> 11:38.619
Oh, God.

11:38.687 --> 11:40.338
Yeah, you see, Bob,
I'm a collector

11:40.405 --> 11:42.773
of rare and exotic trophies.

11:42.841 --> 11:43.874
Well, that's pathetic.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.860
And you have something

11:45.927 --> 11:47.662
I want to add to my collection.

11:47.729 --> 11:49.697
Your mustache.

11:49.748 --> 11:54.652
Your bushy, robust,
filthy eyesore of a moustache.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.087
What are you talking about?

11:56.154 --> 11:58.005
I want you to shave
your mustache,

11:58.073 --> 12:00.458
and bring it over in a baggie,
and I'll pin it on the wall.

12:00.525 --> 12:01.592
What? Why?

12:01.660 --> 12:03.361
As a trophy.
Trophies.

12:03.428 --> 12:05.162
Well, I'm not giving
you my mustache.

12:05.230 --> 12:07.782
Well, I'm not giving you
Jimmy Jr. then.

12:07.849 --> 12:10.384
This is crazy, just let him
go to my daughter's party.

12:10.452 --> 12:12.353
If you want a bag
of hair so bad,

12:12.421 --> 12:14.839
why don't you just pick it out
of the food you serve here?

12:14.906 --> 12:16.207
Ka-boom!

12:16.274 --> 12:17.541
How dare you.

12:17.609 --> 12:20.261
No 'stache, no bash.

12:21.863 --> 12:23.330
So, what'd he say, honey?

12:23.398 --> 12:25.700
Are these lips gonna see
any playing time?

12:25.767 --> 12:27.635
Yeah, is Jimmy Jr.
Coming to my party?

12:27.703 --> 12:30.254
No, Tina. I'm sorry, he's not.

12:30.322 --> 12:32.807
What happened? You two
couldn't work it out?

12:32.874 --> 12:34.642
No! We couldn't work
it out, Linda.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.111
He said the only way
he'll let Jimmy Jr. go

12:37.179 --> 12:38.913
is if I shave my mustache
and give it to him.

12:38.980 --> 12:41.048
So Jimmy Jr. can
come to my party?

12:41.116 --> 12:42.750
What? No, Tina.

12:42.818 --> 12:44.385
But if all you have to do

12:44.453 --> 12:46.420
is shave your mustache
then he can come.

12:46.488 --> 12:49.690
Yeah, it sounds to me like you
just said that Jimmy Jr. can come.

12:49.758 --> 12:51.258
That's what I heard.
Done deal.

12:51.326 --> 12:53.327
I'm not shaving my mustache.

12:53.395 --> 12:54.428
It's my mustache!

12:54.496 --> 12:57.248
Hey, no, watch it.

12:57.315 --> 12:58.816
You know, Bobby, you're
just as handsome

12:58.884 --> 13:00.351
without the
mustache. Kind of.

13:00.419 --> 13:02.420
Uh, so that's what we should
show our kids, lin--

13:02.487 --> 13:04.789
that it's okay
to negotiate with terrorists?

13:04.856 --> 13:07.958
I'd drive a cab every night for
the rest of my life for my kids,

13:08.026 --> 13:10.895
but I'm not letting
Jimmy Pesto humiliate me.

13:10.962 --> 13:12.763
You're the most selfish father
in the world.

13:12.831 --> 13:13.898
Oh, Bob.

13:13.965 --> 13:16.667
Good night!

13:16.752 --> 13:19.053
You can't shave it, Bob.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.755
It's glorious.

13:20.822 --> 13:24.091
Oh, I miss having a mustache.
Pff. Miss it?

13:24.142 --> 13:26.510
Honey, news flash...
I can see it from here.

13:26.578 --> 13:27.812
You can see it from space.

13:27.879 --> 13:29.580
Stop it, cha-cha.

13:29.648 --> 13:32.450
I will thumb your eyeballs
out of your skull. Ay!

13:32.517 --> 13:34.018
Hey, come on.

13:34.102 --> 13:36.070
Glitter, your... I
happen to like the way

13:36.138 --> 13:37.188
your upper lip looks.

13:37.272 --> 13:38.773
Thank you, prince Valiant.

13:38.824 --> 13:40.474
<i>Your shift's almost over,
right, papi?</i>

13:40.525 --> 13:41.826
Yea... uh,
yeah it is.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.527
Why don't you join us
for a beer?

13:43.612 --> 13:45.229
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:45.297 --> 13:47.264
We'll throw back a few beers
and smoke some crack.

13:47.332 --> 13:48.432
Crack?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.201
Just the beer, then?

13:53.338 --> 13:54.872
What is that?

13:54.940 --> 13:56.674
Ooh, your breath!
I know.

13:56.741 --> 13:58.175
Bobby, listen.
Hmm?

13:58.243 --> 13:59.710
All right, I talked to Tina,

13:59.778 --> 14:01.745
I told her how hard
you've been working,

14:01.813 --> 14:03.814
and she agreed to come
to the party tonight.

14:03.882 --> 14:05.249
For a few minutes.
It's something.

14:05.317 --> 14:06.750
What party?

14:06.818 --> 14:08.302
Bob, you're delirious.

14:08.370 --> 14:09.887
<i>Shh. You are.
You're drunk.</i>

14:09.955 --> 14:13.574
I may or may not
have tried crack.

14:13.642 --> 14:16.310
Okay. Last night.
I don't think I did.

14:16.378 --> 14:18.746
But if I did, I liked it.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.031
Okay, Bobby, listen,
go take a nap,

14:21.099 --> 14:22.833
and I'll watch the
restaurant, please.

14:22.901 --> 14:24.952
Take off your clothes.
Bobby!

14:25.020 --> 14:26.620
I got to go to bed.
Bobby?

14:26.688 --> 14:28.489
I don't want to do this.
Stop it.

14:28.557 --> 14:30.241
Get your hands off
me, sick idiot.

14:30.325 --> 14:32.159
Such a freak.

14:32.210 --> 14:33.611
Pull it together.

14:33.678 --> 14:35.462
I'm like an animal!

14:35.530 --> 14:36.831
Keep your voice down.

14:36.882 --> 14:38.299
I'm like king Kong!

14:38.366 --> 14:39.783
Unbelievable.

14:39.851 --> 14:41.669
I need to go to bed.
Good night.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.037
Go get me special pillow.

14:43.104 --> 14:45.155
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

14:45.223 --> 14:48.826
Hey, sleepy bear.

14:48.894 --> 14:50.294
What time is it?

14:50.362 --> 14:51.595
How much longer till the party?

14:51.663 --> 14:52.997
It started a half hour ago.

14:53.064 --> 14:54.448
What? Ow! Oh.

14:54.516 --> 14:55.783
You let me sleep all day?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.735
Why didn't you wake me up?

14:57.802 --> 15:00.154
I tried. That was not the first
pickle I dropped on your face.

15:01.923 --> 15:05.259
The boys hate dancing, and
the girls won't ask the boys.

15:05.327 --> 15:07.745
It's a Mexican stalemate
out there.

15:07.829 --> 15:09.997
Come on, boys. You're
the peanut butter.

15:10.065 --> 15:12.166
Girls, you're the jelly.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.652
Let's make some sandwiches!

15:14.719 --> 15:17.338
Oh, God, why is mort
doing magic?

15:17.405 --> 15:18.873
It's his gift to Tina.

15:18.940 --> 15:21.308
Uh-oh.
I mean, ta-da!

15:23.094 --> 15:24.845
Tina, you look... great.

15:26.464 --> 15:27.498
Maybe I can cheer her up.

15:27.566 --> 15:29.633
Louise, smoke me.

15:31.102 --> 15:33.487
Tina, dance with mommy.

15:33.555 --> 15:35.422
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

15:35.473 --> 15:38.726
It's a party.
All right!

15:38.777 --> 15:40.027
Did someone say party?

15:40.094 --> 15:41.929
They don't go to my school.

15:41.997 --> 15:44.098
I'm sorry, ladies. We're
closed for a private party.

15:44.165 --> 15:46.400
We were invited by Bob.
Bob?

15:46.451 --> 15:47.985
You invited transvestite prostitutes

15:48.053 --> 15:49.687
to our daughter's
birthday party?

15:49.754 --> 15:52.189
No. Maybe. I...

15:52.257 --> 15:54.241
This week has been
kind of a blur.

15:54.292 --> 15:56.377
All of you are coming
to my daughter's party.

15:56.444 --> 15:57.878
We're gonna have so much fun.

15:57.946 --> 15:59.279
And bring whoever you want.

16:00.865 --> 16:02.416
I might have
thrown it out there.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.635
Is this the sweet 13 party?

16:04.703 --> 16:06.470
Dad, you brought all
your nighttime friends,

16:06.554 --> 16:08.822
but you won't
shave your mustache

16:08.890 --> 16:10.975
to get me Jimmy Jr.?

16:12.394 --> 16:13.777
Where do I put my coat?

16:13.845 --> 16:15.479
Oh, hey, marshmallow.

16:17.904 --> 16:19.555
So, marshmallow, how'd
you get your name?

16:19.623 --> 16:22.208
'Cause if you show me a sweet
potato pie, I am on top of it.

16:22.275 --> 16:23.709
I knew it!

16:23.777 --> 16:26.445
Tina, I know you're upset

16:26.513 --> 16:28.781
because Jimmy Jr.'s
not here,

16:28.849 --> 16:30.449
and that there are
more transvestites

16:30.517 --> 16:32.652
than you imagined, but...

16:32.719 --> 16:34.787
Unless you're Jimmy Jr.,
and you're here to kiss my lips,

16:34.855 --> 16:36.122
I don't want to talk to you.

16:50.337 --> 16:51.970
Come on, girl.
It's your party!

16:52.022 --> 16:53.322
You might as well enjoy it.

16:53.407 --> 16:54.807
It's like I always say.

16:54.858 --> 16:56.025
When life gives you lemons...

16:56.109 --> 16:57.660
Tuck em'!

16:57.744 --> 17:00.663
Uh, I think what my girlfriend
here is trying to say is,

17:00.747 --> 17:03.249
when it's time for you
to blossom into a woman,

17:03.316 --> 17:05.151
you can't let anything
stop you.

17:05.218 --> 17:07.185
Not a party, not a boy,

17:07.253 --> 17:08.987
and not a town full of doctors

17:09.039 --> 17:10.756
who refuse
to remove your penis.

17:10.824 --> 17:12.575
And you have
a very good father, baby.

17:12.642 --> 17:14.009
Never forget that.

17:14.077 --> 17:15.961
It's true.

17:16.012 --> 17:17.813
Not many fathers would
make the sacrifices

17:17.881 --> 17:19.832
your father made to
throw you this party.

17:19.883 --> 17:21.400
Working two jobs.

17:21.468 --> 17:23.636
The things he saw.
The things he smelled.

17:23.704 --> 17:25.971
He deserves an award.

17:31.361 --> 17:33.529
Bob, what'd you do?

17:33.597 --> 17:35.231
You lost your nose cozy.

17:35.298 --> 17:37.733
Oh, Bob.

17:37.818 --> 17:39.652
You made yourself ugly
to save Tina's party.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.555
Yes, Linda, this is why
I didn't want to do it.

17:42.622 --> 17:44.039
But you know, it's worth it

17:44.124 --> 17:47.309
if it means
Tina will be a happy teenager.

17:47.377 --> 17:49.779
Just stop staring.

17:49.846 --> 17:51.230
Stop! Don't do this.

17:51.298 --> 17:52.698
I... just did it.

17:52.766 --> 17:54.133
You don't need to.

17:54.201 --> 17:55.668
I don't want you to.

17:55.736 --> 17:57.586
You know
how mustaches work, right?

17:57.654 --> 18:00.139
Well, don't give
it to Jimmy Pesto.

18:00.206 --> 18:01.807
What about Jimmy Jr.?

18:01.875 --> 18:03.759
Jimmy Jr. isn't gonna
make this party perfect.

18:03.827 --> 18:06.762
You already have.
Really?

18:06.847 --> 18:09.548
I'm sorry I didn't appreciate
everything you've done for me.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.400
I didn't appreciate it
as a girl,

18:11.485 --> 18:13.753
but I do appreciate it
as a woman.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.388
It would have been nice to hear
you say that a minute ago.

18:23.013 --> 18:24.914
Bastard.

18:27.451 --> 18:29.418
Come and join the party, Bob.

18:29.503 --> 18:30.953
That's Jimmy Pesto,
cha-cha.

18:31.037 --> 18:32.705
The guy
I was telling you about.

18:32.773 --> 18:34.423
Wait. That's
Jimmy Pesto?!

18:34.508 --> 18:35.958
I know that guy.

18:36.026 --> 18:38.076
<i>We all know
that guy.</i>

18:38.128 --> 18:40.212
But we know him
as baby num num.

18:40.263 --> 18:42.047
Baby num num?

18:42.098 --> 18:43.966
Wait. Pesto is one
of your dates?

18:44.034 --> 18:45.334
He wishes.

18:45.402 --> 18:46.919
We run in the same circles.

18:46.970 --> 18:49.138
He's a regular
over at the desire dungeon.

18:49.222 --> 18:51.173
He's what's known
as a diaper-lover.

18:51.241 --> 18:52.775
You know what that is?

18:52.843 --> 18:54.226
It's nasty.

18:55.695 --> 18:58.147
Jimmy Pesto is a diaper-lover?

18:59.766 --> 19:01.550
Ha, ha, ha.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.552
Hello, Bob.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.938
Well, I see I'm getting
my trophy after all.

19:05.989 --> 19:09.558
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
Not so fast, baby num num.

19:09.626 --> 19:10.910
Baby...

19:10.977 --> 19:12.411
How do you know about that?

19:12.479 --> 19:13.562
Hey, baby.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.330
Oh.
Hi!

19:14.397 --> 19:15.564
No.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.999
We just wanted to see

19:17.067 --> 19:18.834
if "wittle" baby num num...

19:18.902 --> 19:20.236
Shh. Come on. Quiet.

19:20.303 --> 19:21.770
Wanted to change his mind

19:21.838 --> 19:23.806
about letting Jimmy Jr.
Go to Tina's party.

19:23.874 --> 19:25.925
Or maybe he wants the whole
"westaurant" to know about...

19:25.992 --> 19:28.394
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Hey! We got...

19:28.461 --> 19:30.112
Fresh pie! ...
How he likes to put on...

19:30.180 --> 19:31.764
Listen, would you...?
...Diapers and poop in them.

19:35.569 --> 19:37.319
I don't believe it.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.107
Thanks, dad.

19:42.175 --> 19:43.993
You're the best pimp
I'm ever gonna have.

19:44.077 --> 19:46.912
I've been waiting to hear
those words all my life, Tina.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.531
Happy Birthday.

19:48.615 --> 19:50.349
Bobby, come help me
with the candles.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.750
This one goes out
to the birthday girl.

I'm gonna glue this to my
