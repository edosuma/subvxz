morning in his holding cell

was trying to kill him,

to be protected.

of Campbell's death,

6 days earlier, she showed up
with this letter

a few days before.

04:09.072 --> 04:11.239
They started a file, but Helen wasn't
especially concerned.

04:11.241 --> 04:13.741
And in light of Campbell's death,
they exhumed Helen Mitchell's body,

04:13.743 --> 04:16.244

were found in her system as well.

04:16.245 --> 04:17.612

11:24.236 --> 11:27.003
Reid: The victim left
momentarily...

11:28.906 --> 11:31.141
The unsub slipped in
the arsenic...

11:36.614 --> 11:38.581
And left the bar.

11:39.650 --> 11:42.786
And when Campbell returned
from the bathroom...

11:47.558 --> 11:49.626
He took a drink.

11:54.465 --> 11:56.533
He never had a clue.

11:56.535 --> 11:59.302
[Clapping]
Oh! Holy cow!

11:59.304 --> 12:02.605
[Laughing]

12:02.607 --> 12:05.308
All right, Bill.
Last chance, buddy.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.944
You sure you want
to leave all this splendor

12:07.946 --> 12:10.246
for some lousy island
in the Mediterranean?

12:10.248 --> 12:14.284
You know, Bill almost jumped the gun
and went 20 years ago.

12:14.286 --> 12:16.419
Had his ticket bought
for Greece and everything.

12:16.421 --> 12:17.654
[Laughs] Except,

12:17.656 --> 12:19.989
me and him went out
and tied one on the night before,

12:19.991 --> 12:22.725
and Bill missed the shuttle
van to the airport.

12:22.727 --> 12:24.027
Aww...
[Laughter]

12:24.029 --> 12:26.529
And I could never
look a Mai Tai in the face again.

12:26.531 --> 12:29.265
Hurry it up, Wick. I don't like room
temperature champagne.

12:29.267 --> 12:31.201
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:31.203 --> 12:33.703
But here's to
your new life, Bill.

12:33.705 --> 12:35.605
Yeah!
Congratulations, bill.

12:39.443 --> 12:40.924
Just remember to keep

12:40.949 --> 12:42.279
an extra hammock
strung up on the beach

12:42.280 --> 12:43.947
for your old buddy Wick, huh?

12:44.949 --> 12:46.282
Come on, speech.

12:46.284 --> 12:47.417
Come on.

12:47.419 --> 12:50.620
Speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech...

12:50.622 --> 12:52.856
Um, I...

12:54.792 --> 12:59.496
I was just thinking about how
all of this was here before...

13:00.931 --> 13:04.868
And then how it's all
gonna be here after.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.673
You know, 'cause...

13:13.677 --> 13:15.745
When they're living
like--

13:15.747 --> 13:17.347
[laughs] You know, I think--

13:17.349 --> 13:19.710
I think Bill's given up
on English already and

13:19.735 --> 13:21.285
is already talking Greek.

13:21.286 --> 13:23.186
[Laughter]

13:23.188 --> 13:24.888
Come on up, guys,
get some cake.

13:24.890 --> 13:27.757
[Indistinct chatter]

13:34.698 --> 13:37.200
Same kind of twine
found in Wayne Campbell's pocket.

13:37.202 --> 13:40.870
A friend of the victim's, Benjie Ruiz,
came by the shop around 9:40

13:40.872 --> 13:44.274
and saw a single customer
milling around in the muffler section.

13:44.276 --> 13:46.075
There was no
surveillance camera,

13:46.077 --> 13:48.111
but a cash register
receipt confirms

13:48.113 --> 13:50.079
somebody exchanged
a muffler at 9:36.

13:50.081 --> 13:52.148
When Mr. Ruiz left
5 minutes later,

13:52.150 --> 13:53.750
the customer
was still there.

13:53.752 --> 13:56.686
At 9:50,
Carlos was found dead.

13:56.688 --> 13:57.987
No customer in sight.

13:57.989 --> 13:59.856
Do we have
a description of him?

13:59.858 --> 14:02.792
White male in his 40s,
large build, and he wore a hat.

14:02.794 --> 14:04.360
That's the same description
the bartender gave to me and JJ.

14:04.362 --> 14:05.862
It's gotta be our guy.

14:05.864 --> 14:08.331
A green car was parked
outside when Benjie Ruiz arrived

14:08.333 --> 14:09.866
and was still there
when he left.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.434
No make or model,
but pretty old.

14:11.436 --> 14:12.869
According to Mr. Ruiz,

14:12.871 --> 14:15.638
Carlos had no drug
or alcohol issues.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.941
He was a solid,
hard-working family man.

14:17.943 --> 14:19.475
Well, that puts a dent
in our theory of an unsub

14:19.477 --> 14:21.177
punishing people
for their indiscretions.

14:21.179 --> 14:22.679
Unless Carlos had a vice
we don't know about.

14:22.681 --> 14:24.914
We just confirmed that
the chocolates and the water cooler

14:24.916 --> 14:26.215
both tested positive
for arsenic.

14:26.217 --> 14:28.418
Any twine found at
Helen Mitchell's house?

14:28.420 --> 14:30.219
A couple feet of it were
tossed in the kitchen trash.

14:30.221 --> 14:32.055
We're thinking the chocolates
may have been wrapped in it.

14:32.057 --> 14:33.590
Guys, I did a geographic
profile of the victims,

14:33.592 --> 14:35.058
and it turns out
they all lived or worked

14:35.060 --> 14:38.094
in the same 2.65 square-mile
radius in the north part of the city.

14:38.096 --> 14:39.395
Well, that gives us
his hunting ground,

14:39.397 --> 14:40.897
but not his victim
selection criteria.

14:40.899 --> 14:42.432
The bartender said
the unsub may have

14:42.434 --> 14:44.767
struck up a conversation
with Campbell there that night.

14:44.769 --> 14:46.169
That's ballsy.

14:46.171 --> 14:48.304
The same way he walked
into Carlos' store

14:48.306 --> 14:49.606
to exchange the muffler.

14:49.608 --> 14:51.040
And for some reason,
he feels the need

14:51.042 --> 14:54.177
to interact with his victims
in the hours before they die.

15:30.381 --> 15:33.282
Aah!

15:33.284 --> 15:36.185
[Grunting, shouting]

15:39.790 --> 15:42.125
Aah!

15:43.927 --> 15:45.395
Uhh!

15:48.098 --> 15:52.568
[Indistinct muttering]

15:52.570 --> 15:55.872
[Overlapping voices]

15:58.642 --> 16:01.678
[Voices fading]

16:32.509 --> 16:35.645
[Kids chattering,
ball bouncing]

16:58.435 --> 17:00.803
[Line ringing]

17:00.805 --> 17:02.371
911. What's your emergency?

17:02.373 --> 17:05.241
It's not an emergency, really.
I just want to file a complaint

17:05.242 --> 17:06.843
against some kids
in the neighborhood.

17:06.845 --> 17:08.377
Hold on, ma'am.
I'm transferring you.

17:08.378 --> 17:09.679
Ok.

17:12.182 --> 17:15.184
Uh-huh. These kids
are how old?

17:15.185 --> 17:18.054
And can you tell me
the nature of the note?

17:18.056 --> 17:20.356
Can you read it to me?

17:23.026 --> 17:24.660
Ma'am, do not hang up.

17:24.662 --> 17:27.130
I'm getting someone
from the FBI.

17:27.132 --> 17:28.364
FBI?

17:28.366 --> 17:30.266
I don't need that.
It's only some kids.

17:30.268 --> 17:33.736
Agent Rossi, we have another
person with a note.

17:33.738 --> 17:36.038
A Janice Cheswick.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.940
[Telephone ringing]

17:40.944 --> 17:43.579
Ma'am, this is
agent David Rossi.

17:43.581 --> 17:46.015
Are you alone
in your house?

17:46.017 --> 17:48.050
Yes. I mean, I--

17:48.052 --> 17:49.352
I think so.

17:49.354 --> 17:52.822
Double check that all your doors
and windows are secured.

17:52.824 --> 17:56.025
Stay calm, and do not
hang up your phone.

17:56.027 --> 17:58.060
My God.

18:08.806 --> 18:10.873
Everything is locked.
Now what?

18:10.875 --> 18:13.709
All right. Police have been dispatched
to your home.

18:13.711 --> 18:15.378
Do not leave your house.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.546
I'm scared!

18:16.548 --> 18:18.314
Listen, Janice.

18:18.316 --> 18:23.019
This is very important that you
do not eat or drink anything.

18:23.021 --> 18:24.520
I won't.

18:24.522 --> 18:27.290
Ok. Everything's
gonna be ok.

18:27.292 --> 18:28.891
Help is on the way.

18:34.565 --> 18:35.798
[Screaming]

18:35.800 --> 18:37.567
Janice?

18:37.569 --> 18:38.868
Janice?!

18:38.870 --> 18:40.536
[Screaming] Help!

18:40.538 --> 18:42.605
Janice!

18:42.607 --> 18:43.739
[Screaming]

18:43.741 --> 18:45.908
[Line disconnects]

19:07.352 --> 19:09.220
JJ: We've got an APB out
in the surrounding area

19:09.222 --> 19:10.421
for an older green car.

19:10.423 --> 19:11.522
Hotch: Do we know
how he got in?

19:11.524 --> 19:13.958
Garage door shows
signs of forced entry.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.693
Probably spiked the wine.

19:15.695 --> 19:17.895
And when she called
the police instead...

19:17.897 --> 19:20.297
This time he used the
twine to strangle her.

19:20.299 --> 19:21.532
Overkill.

19:21.534 --> 19:23.033
The unsub was denied
what he wanted most,

19:23.035 --> 19:25.035
the chance to engage
with her before she died.

19:25.037 --> 19:28.572
Sharp knife,
this level of frenzy.

19:28.574 --> 19:30.040
Hopefully
this son of a bitch

19:30.042 --> 19:32.176
also did some damage
to himself.

19:34.279 --> 19:39.250
I'll notify local E.R.s to be
on the lookout for hand lacerations.

19:40.986 --> 19:43.454
You all right, Dave?

19:44.723 --> 19:47.024
I told her
she'd be ok, Aaron,

19:47.026 --> 19:49.360
that she'd be fine.

19:50.762 --> 19:53.164
Let's go find this guy.

20:01.706 --> 20:05.142
Hey, kid. Our geo profile
just go turned upside down.

20:05.144 --> 20:07.111
Our latest victims lives
and works a good 10 miles

20:07.113 --> 20:08.779
from the unsub's
hunting ground.

20:08.781 --> 20:11.115
He's either branching out
or we're missing something.

20:11.117 --> 20:13.651
Hey, baby girl, I need you
to work that magic of yours.

20:13.653 --> 20:15.085
Rub my lamp,
release the genie.

20:15.087 --> 20:16.654
Our latest victim,
Janice Cheswick--

20:16.656 --> 20:18.923
track her activities
as far back as it takes

20:18.925 --> 20:21.258
to find a link between
her and our other victims.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.360
As far back
as in days or weeks?

20:23.362 --> 20:24.862
Months, if necessary.

20:24.864 --> 20:27.331
Pushing it, Aladdin,
but I'm a go.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.866
That's why I love you.

20:28.868 --> 20:30.467
These pieces of twine
are all different lengths.

20:30.469 --> 20:32.169
Are you just now
figuring that out?

20:32.171 --> 20:33.637
I think it's by design.

20:33.639 --> 20:36.272
Starting with the first victim,
the lengths are 25, 15, 12,

20:36.375 --> 20:37.775
and 19 inches.
Yeah, so what?

20:37.777 --> 20:39.109
If you convert inches
to centimeters,

20:39.111 --> 20:41.445
you'll have
64, 38, 31, and 48,

20:41.447 --> 20:44.248
the exact ages
of all 4 victims.

20:45.784 --> 20:48.118
I think I know
what this is about.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.087
The man we're looking for
is a highly organized offender,

20:50.089 --> 20:53.090
but we don't yet know why or how
he's choosing his victims.

20:53.092 --> 20:54.825
These appear
to be killings of opportunity,

20:54.827 --> 20:56.460
yet he's researched
his targets

20:56.462 --> 20:59.163
as though they'd been selected
carefully and with premeditation.

20:59.165 --> 21:00.364
They run the gamut.

21:00.366 --> 21:02.266
Young and old, rich and poor,
male and female.

21:02.268 --> 21:04.335
But with all of them,
he leaves behind a piece of twine.

21:04.337 --> 21:06.070
Why does he do that?

21:06.072 --> 21:07.571
What does the twine
represent?

21:07.573 --> 21:09.473
In Greek mythology,
a person's destiny

21:09.475 --> 21:11.175
was in the hands
of the 3 fates.

21:11.177 --> 21:13.177
One to spin
the thread of life,

21:13.179 --> 21:14.445
another to
measure the thread,

21:14.447 --> 21:15.913
and finally atropos,

21:15.915 --> 21:18.582
the one who cut the thread with
shears at the moment of death.

21:18.584 --> 21:20.384
Hotch: We think that's what
the twine symbolizes.

21:20.386 --> 21:23.287
He's decided the fate of his victims
and then he observes them.

21:23.289 --> 21:26.423
As if assuming the form of
a mythological God himself.

21:26.425 --> 21:28.058
JJ: We don't know
what triggered the spree,

21:28.060 --> 21:31.895
but the unsub may have recently
suffered a loss and is now lashing out.

21:31.897 --> 21:35.466
Blake: If he can't control his own fate,
he will control others.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.101
This unsub is also
quite meticulous.

21:37.103 --> 21:39.436
He studies his victims
in advance to the murders,

21:39.438 --> 21:42.206
follows them, learns their habits,
even interacts with them.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.608
Hotch: His need to engage
directly with his victims

21:44.610 --> 21:47.411
is a compulsion that overrides
the risk of being caught.

21:47.413 --> 21:49.546
Morgan: This compulsion
will likely be his downfall

21:49.548 --> 21:51.081
and lead to his eventual
capture.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.917
The time period between
warning his victims and killing them

21:53.919 --> 21:55.753
is getting shorter
with each murder.

21:55.755 --> 21:56.987
He could be unraveling.

21:56.989 --> 21:58.455
The public
needs to be made aware

21:58.457 --> 22:00.057
that if they receive a note
similar to the ones

22:00.059 --> 22:02.960
he's already sent, they need
to contact 911 immediately.

22:02.962 --> 22:04.628
Thank you.

22:13.405 --> 22:15.606
So sorry,
my beautiful creatures,

22:15.608 --> 22:17.241
my DMV search
yielded nuttin',

22:17.243 --> 22:18.909
but I did make progress
on another front.

22:18.911 --> 22:22.446
That Janice Cheswick, she lives clear
across on the other side of town, right?

22:22.448 --> 22:25.749
Well, last week,
at 4:17 in the afternoon

22:25.751 --> 22:27.785
on the 23rd,
to be precise,

22:27.787 --> 22:31.055
she charged a double
soy latte at a coffee shop

22:31.057 --> 22:34.491
smack dab in the middle
of the geo zone of the other 3 victims.

22:34.493 --> 22:36.493
Sending this now.

22:36.495 --> 22:38.128
It's next to the university.

22:38.130 --> 22:39.730
The unsub may be
a part of academia.

22:39.732 --> 22:41.446
All right, Garcia, start with the schools
of classics and humanities

22:41.447 --> 22:42.268
and work out from there.

22:42.293 --> 22:44.399
Check any students
or faculty for red flags.

22:44.737 --> 22:47.137
A fighting bull like moi
looks for nothing else.

22:47.139 --> 22:50.474
I've got a sudden craving
for a double soy latte.

22:50.476 --> 22:52.643
Let's take a ride.

22:54.279 --> 22:57.648
Do you recognize
any of these people?

22:57.650 --> 22:59.817
I don't. Sorry.

22:59.819 --> 23:01.285
What's this about?

23:01.287 --> 23:03.020
We're investigating
a series of murders,

23:03.022 --> 23:03.943
and we think the killer

23:03.961 --> 23:05.430
may have seen one or more
of these victims

23:05.431 --> 23:06.248
at this coffee shop.

23:06.273 --> 23:08.273
Victims? You mean...

23:08.361 --> 23:09.727
All these people
got killed?

23:09.729 --> 23:13.163
Excuse me. Is that
a pinhole camera?

23:17.836 --> 23:20.904
You secretly videotape
your employees?

23:20.906 --> 23:23.807
Not the employees,
just the cash register area.

23:23.809 --> 23:26.243
Yeah, well, I guess
that means the employees.

23:26.245 --> 23:28.045
We've got
a pilferage problem.

23:28.047 --> 23:30.080
How long has this
surveillance been going on?

23:30.082 --> 23:33.217
Uh...5 weeks.

23:33.219 --> 23:35.719
Go to 4:17 p.m.
on the 23rd.

23:41.693 --> 23:43.660
That's her.

23:44.863 --> 23:46.797
That's all of them.

23:51.069 --> 23:53.003
The unsub must be
just out of camera range.

23:53.005 --> 23:54.671
This is the moment
he selected all his victims.

23:54.673 --> 23:56.273
It ties in with his idea
of fate, that these 4

23:56.275 --> 23:57.941
were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

23:57.943 --> 24:00.077
Let's bring in Benjie Ruiz
and the bartender

24:00.079 --> 24:00.928
and see if they recognize

24:00.953 --> 24:02.833
anyone who came in that day
as the man they saw.

24:03.249 --> 24:07.050
There's another identification
we need to make, and fast.

24:07.052 --> 24:09.052
The next in line.

24:40.418 --> 24:42.986
[Knock on door]

24:42.988 --> 24:44.621
Who is it?

24:44.623 --> 24:46.690
It's me, Wick.

24:46.692 --> 24:49.526
Uh, ok, just a minute.

24:56.935 --> 24:58.602
Hey.

24:58.604 --> 25:00.971
You forgot to turn in
your keys.

25:00.973 --> 25:02.306
Oh.

25:02.308 --> 25:05.309
Heh. Thought I'd swing by
and get 'em,

25:05.311 --> 25:08.545
before you were on
the other side of the world.

25:08.547 --> 25:11.048
I haven't been here
in a while.

25:11.050 --> 25:12.850
Yeah.

25:12.852 --> 25:14.251
Sheesh.

25:14.253 --> 25:16.720
[Laughs] I love what
you've done with the place, though.

25:16.722 --> 25:18.322
Thanks, man.

25:18.324 --> 25:21.124
Oh, wow, what did you
do to your hand?

25:21.126 --> 25:23.227
Oh, I cut it. Clumsy.

25:24.229 --> 25:28.098
So what's the deal
with you and Greece, anyway?

25:28.100 --> 25:32.236
I don't know. Just
always made sense to me.

25:32.238 --> 25:34.037
Really?

25:35.507 --> 25:37.541
This makes sense to you?

25:37.543 --> 25:40.110
Yeah.

25:49.621 --> 25:51.221
Here.

25:55.326 --> 25:56.660
Thanks.

25:58.663 --> 26:00.864
Well, man...

26:00.866 --> 26:02.466
Safe travels.

26:03.301 --> 26:06.136
I should've gone.

26:06.138 --> 26:08.338
20 years ago,

26:08.340 --> 26:09.640
I should have gone.

26:09.642 --> 26:12.809
You were broke
20 years ago, Bill.

26:12.811 --> 26:16.380
Hell, I did you
a favor that night.

26:16.382 --> 26:18.849
A favor?

26:18.851 --> 26:23.120
I...got you wasted
on purpose.

26:26.090 --> 26:27.591
Come on.

26:27.593 --> 26:30.594
You had to have figured
that out by now.

26:32.697 --> 26:34.398
Like you were about
to leave a primo job

26:34.400 --> 26:36.033
to go halfway
across the world,

26:36.035 --> 26:38.702
with no money,
no prospects.

26:38.704 --> 26:41.405
Then your mom got sick
right after that, right?

26:41.407 --> 26:44.107
Well, if you'd have gone,
you wouldn't have been here

26:44.109 --> 26:45.943
to look after her
the way you did.

26:45.945 --> 26:47.544
And now you're set, man.

26:47.546 --> 26:50.147
You got--you got your healthcare,
you got your pension.

26:50.149 --> 26:51.548
You worked hard for that.

26:51.550 --> 26:54.117
You can go do Greece in style now.
You've earned it.

26:54.119 --> 26:57.120
[Overlapping voices]

27:09.240 --> 27:10.194
How long have they
been at it?

27:10.195 --> 27:12.662
2 hours, 11 1/2 minutes.

27:23.207 --> 27:26.409
Garcia's still combing through
university records.

27:26.411 --> 27:27.844
No luck.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.545
The fifth customer
paid in cash,

27:29.547 --> 27:30.980
so we can't track her.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.316
But an enhanced VidCap of her
is being distributed

27:33.318 --> 27:36.252
to everyone that worked
at the coffee shop the last 6 months.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.054
Hopefully someone knows
who she is.

27:38.056 --> 27:41.257
At the coffee shop, a couple of guys
came in wearing scrubs.

27:41.259 --> 27:44.293
Is there a hospital
near campus?

27:45.195 --> 27:46.863
Yeah, there's
a medical center

27:46.865 --> 27:48.664
affiliated
with the university.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.300
What if that's why the killer
was in the vicinity?

27:51.302 --> 27:53.302
For the hospital,
not the university.

27:53.304 --> 27:56.372
We profiled the unsub
may have experienced a loss.

27:56.374 --> 27:59.275
What if someone
he was close to died

27:59.277 --> 28:01.010
or was diagnosed
with a serious illness?

28:01.012 --> 28:03.746
Except this doesn't feel like a guy
who has close friends

28:03.748 --> 28:05.882
or a tight-knit family.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.416
What if it's him?

28:09.219 --> 28:12.221
The unsub himself
got some bad news.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.191
If they told him
he had a terminal illness,

28:15.193 --> 28:16.659
it would explain the M.O.

28:16.661 --> 28:18.194
You get thrown
a curveball...

28:18.196 --> 28:19.829
You throw a curveball back.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.898
Do unto others
what was done unto you.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.834
Let's get Garcia on it.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.102
Let's go, guys.

28:27.504 --> 28:29.705
They couldn't identify
any of the other customers

28:29.707 --> 28:31.807
as the man they saw
at the auto shop or sports bar.

28:31.809 --> 28:33.376
The killer is picking his
victims in the moment, right?

28:33.378 --> 28:35.611
You, you, you, and you.

28:35.613 --> 28:37.647
That's how it looks.
No advance planning.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.249
Yet he later stalks each one,
learning their habits.

28:40.251 --> 28:41.684
How does he manage
to do that

28:41.686 --> 28:43.986
if they all scatter
after they get their coffee?

28:46.256 --> 28:47.990
Parking lot.

28:49.459 --> 28:52.361
Reid: He saw them
through the window.

28:52.363 --> 28:56.599
Waited till they came out
one by one and drove away.

29:05.442 --> 29:07.376
Morgan: Took down
their license plate numbers.

29:10.647 --> 29:12.949
A little research
at the DMV.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.918
None of the coffee shop employees
can identify the fifth woman in line.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.154
Detective, can you make
the surveillance video go any faster?

29:18.156 --> 29:19.655
It'll go any speed
you want.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.691
Go back to the beginning.
I need to watch all 5 weeks in the video.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.025
525 hours.
But that's--

29:23.027 --> 29:25.928
Yeah. We don't have
time for that.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.997
Reid, tell him what
you did this morning for breakfast.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.665
I read "War and Peace."
Reread it, actually.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.334
This time in
the original Russian.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.902
Trust me, detective,
there's enough time.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.137
[Sighs]

29:35.139 --> 29:38.374
The university was a wash,
but the med center may just pay off.

29:38.376 --> 29:40.343
In the last 3 months,
485 patients

29:40.345 --> 29:42.144
were diagnosed
with terminal illness.

29:42.146 --> 29:44.947
34 of those were white
males in their 40s.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.216
8 of those have green cars
over 15 years old.

29:47.218 --> 29:48.618
Like I said, I'm close.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.420
If there was only a way
to research who wears hats.

29:51.422 --> 29:53.689
Did any of the 8 have reason
to be at the hospital on April 23rd?

29:53.691 --> 29:56.125
23rd...

29:58.295 --> 30:00.596
Bingo! William Harding
had an appointment with his oncologist,

30:00.598 --> 30:01.664
got the bad news.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.266
An address, Garcia.
Sending it now.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.101
Thank you.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.369
FBI!

30:26.023 --> 30:28.024
Hotch.

30:44.908 --> 30:46.375
How do you do that?

30:46.377 --> 30:48.077
By employing the same
principles used in speed reading.

30:48.079 --> 30:49.779
I minimize subvocalization
of the images

30:49.781 --> 30:51.113
and reduce
cognitive load by--

30:51.115 --> 30:52.548
Wait, wait.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.750
Back up the feed.

30:55.752 --> 30:57.987
There.

31:01.758 --> 31:03.159
That's her.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.960
Can you push in
on her name tag?

31:04.962 --> 31:06.829
Yeah.

31:12.602 --> 31:15.438
[Doorbell rings]

31:18.442 --> 31:20.409
Hey. It's 12.50.

31:20.411 --> 31:22.611
Hold on.
Let me get my wallet.

31:28.452 --> 31:29.652
There you go.

31:29.654 --> 31:30.953
Thank you very much.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.122
[Cell phone ringing]
Bye.

31:37.928 --> 31:39.595
Bonnie Taylor
isn't answering.

31:39.597 --> 31:41.030
ID this her home address?

31:41.032 --> 31:42.431
Yeah, but today's
her day off, so she's not at work.

31:42.433 --> 31:45.167
Detective, send squad cars
to this address immediately.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.535
Right away.

31:47.971 --> 31:49.138
[Sighs]

31:49.140 --> 31:51.941
So much for my diet.

31:52.943 --> 31:55.311
[Sirens]

32:07.824 --> 32:10.526
And you're sure you've
never seen this man?

32:10.528 --> 32:13.262
Uh...I'm positive.

32:13.264 --> 32:17.299
This was in
the mailbox outside.

32:19.803 --> 32:21.504
Oh, my God.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.672
When was the last time
you checked your mailbox?

32:23.674 --> 32:26.108
Uh, yesterday, I think.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.644
Wait, no, um,
the day before.

32:28.646 --> 32:30.379
I--I...

32:30.381 --> 32:32.248
I skip sometimes.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.249
Excuse us.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.617
Ok.

32:36.953 --> 32:39.220
They haven't found
any arsenic yet.

32:39.221 --> 32:40.888
We must have
gotten here first.

32:40.890 --> 32:42.281
No, he had plenty of time.

32:42.306 --> 32:43.858
I don't think Bonnie's
his target anymore.

32:43.859 --> 32:46.093
The shift in the M.O.
is too dramatic.

32:46.095 --> 32:48.062
The time between leaving the note
and the murders was contracting,

32:48.064 --> 32:50.297
not expanding, and he made no effort
to interact with her.

32:50.299 --> 32:51.899
He could be devolving.

32:51.901 --> 32:53.901
It's not a loss of focus,
it's a shift in focus.

32:53.903 --> 32:56.570
Between the time that Harding
left the note and now,

32:56.572 --> 32:59.673
a more important target's
presented itself.

33:09.451 --> 33:11.518
You must be a glutton
for punishment.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.188
One day retired and
you're back for more.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.756
I thought we could
have a drink.

33:15.758 --> 33:17.391
A drink.

33:17.393 --> 33:21.061
Ah, I'm liking this
new Bill Harding already.

33:23.798 --> 33:25.232
What's the occasion?

33:25.234 --> 33:27.868
I didn't realize
until today

33:27.870 --> 33:31.005
how you'd gone out
of your way for me 20 years ago.

33:31.007 --> 33:33.140
Oh, Bill.

33:34.042 --> 33:36.744
I thought I'd return
the favor.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.181
Skol.

33:55.758 --> 33:57.934
Garcia, does Bill Harding
have any family in the area?

33:57.935 --> 33:59.100
Parents deceased, no siblings.

33:59.102 --> 34:00.435
What about his job?

34:00.437 --> 34:03.204
Uh, worked the cargo bays
in a shipyard.

34:03.206 --> 34:05.607
Yesterday was his last day,
actually.

34:05.609 --> 34:07.142
What type of cancer
does he have?

34:07.144 --> 34:08.743
Mesothelioma.

34:08.745 --> 34:10.178
Asbestos.

34:10.179 --> 34:11.646
He got it working
at the shipyard.

34:11.648 --> 34:13.181
His anger might be
directed toward someone there.

34:13.183 --> 34:14.516
Send Morgan
the work address.

34:14.518 --> 34:15.684
Yes, sir.

34:18.154 --> 34:19.454
Look at you, huh?

34:19.456 --> 34:22.290
Going off to live
your dream.

34:22.292 --> 34:23.692
And here I am.

34:23.694 --> 34:28.295
I got the wife, kids,
a two-damn-car garage.

34:28.297 --> 34:32.233
Probably be working on these docks
for the rest of my life.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.168
Bill: Cheers.

34:36.672 --> 34:38.344
Oh, God, you know,

34:38.370 --> 34:40.242
if we ever run out of
paint thinner around here,

34:40.243 --> 34:41.842
I know what to buy.

34:41.844 --> 34:44.179
Hotch: Does he have any
criminal history or mental health issues?

34:44.181 --> 34:47.614
Well, he's been on
antidepressants most of his life.

34:47.617 --> 34:49.184
But he's got
a clean police record.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.587
Oh, my.

34:52.589 --> 34:53.722
What is it?

34:53.724 --> 34:56.591
He was part of a massive
police search and rescue

34:56.592 --> 34:58.426
when he was 6 years old.

34:58.428 --> 35:01.863
When I was 6, before my folks
moved here from Idaho,

35:01.865 --> 35:06.201
my best friend Randy
and I got lost up in the mountains.

35:06.203 --> 35:08.670
We were on
a camping trip with...

35:08.672 --> 35:10.939
our parents.

35:11.974 --> 35:13.908
It started snowing
and got cold,

35:13.910 --> 35:17.479
so we decided to separate to try
to find our way back and get help.

35:17.481 --> 35:21.383
Randy never made it.
I did.

35:23.219 --> 35:27.355
When they found Randy,
he was frozen.

35:27.357 --> 35:31.559
I was in the hospital
for a week.

35:31.561 --> 35:34.362
Damn, Bill.

35:34.364 --> 35:36.698
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

35:36.700 --> 35:39.234
People said
it was my fault.

35:39.236 --> 35:41.136
We shouldn't have
split up.

35:41.138 --> 35:43.171
They think
that's why Randy died.

35:43.173 --> 35:44.239
Come on.

35:44.241 --> 35:46.875
When I was in
the hospital,

35:46.877 --> 35:49.944
my first-grade teacher
came to visit me.

35:49.946 --> 35:52.080
And she gave me
this book.

35:52.082 --> 35:55.917
A kids book
on Greek mythology.

35:55.919 --> 35:57.819
I opened it...

35:57.821 --> 35:59.621
And there it was.

35:59.623 --> 36:02.123
There what was?

36:02.125 --> 36:04.225
A picture of
the Labyrinth.

36:04.227 --> 36:06.394
It looked just like
that forest

36:06.396 --> 36:09.197
that Randy and I
got lost in.

36:09.199 --> 36:11.966
But I escaped.

36:11.968 --> 36:13.935
Just like Theseus.

36:13.937 --> 36:16.438
Like Theseus.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.908
You know, you're starting
to talk a little crazy.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.242
You know that, don't you?

36:21.244 --> 36:22.710
Oh, it's not crazy.

36:22.712 --> 36:24.446
It's fate.

36:24.448 --> 36:28.149
I got out...

36:28.151 --> 36:30.018
and he did not.

36:31.253 --> 36:33.021
Read this.

36:42.398 --> 36:45.500
[Chuckles]

36:49.472 --> 36:51.206
What, is this a joke?

36:51.208 --> 36:53.808
Sorry.

36:55.778 --> 36:56.978
Not funny, Bill.

36:56.980 --> 36:58.346
No.

37:02.651 --> 37:04.480
I did more digging, Hotch,

37:04.505 --> 37:06.722
and I can tell you where
he's gonna be a week from now--

37:06.723 --> 37:08.556
flight 906, seat 23A,

37:08.558 --> 37:10.125
LAX to Athens, Greece.

37:10.127 --> 37:12.494
Get this. Bill Harding

37:12.496 --> 37:14.896
also applied for
an extended visa to Greece

37:14.898 --> 37:16.331
way back in 1994.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.298
Did he go?

37:17.300 --> 37:18.566
Negative.
He reserved a spot

37:18.568 --> 37:20.735
with Higgins
airport shuttle,

37:20.737 --> 37:24.239
didn't show up,
plane left without him...

37:24.241 --> 37:27.909
Oh, man, you are not
gonna believe this.

37:27.911 --> 37:30.578
I'm dying.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.013
Cancer.

37:32.015 --> 37:34.649
The doctor says I have
3 to 6 months to live,

37:34.651 --> 37:37.852
but it doesn't matter,
because most of me died

37:37.854 --> 37:39.521
when I missed that plane.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.623
Oh, Bill...

37:41.625 --> 37:43.892
When I left
the doctor's office,

37:43.894 --> 37:46.661
I stopped
at a coffee shop...

37:46.663 --> 37:50.899
[Indistinct chatter,
laughter]

37:55.204 --> 37:58.006
[Laughing]

38:04.580 --> 38:07.182
I couldn't get out.

38:07.184 --> 38:11.719
Because there were
just all of these people

38:11.721 --> 38:14.355
all around, so happy,

38:14.357 --> 38:18.526
making plans.
They were so damn sure

38:18.528 --> 38:23.398
that nothing bad was
ever gonna happen to them.

38:25.734 --> 38:30.705
[Whispering voices]

38:33.375 --> 38:35.877
It's fate.

38:35.879 --> 38:39.714
Some are chosen
and some are not.

38:39.716 --> 38:42.016
What are you gonna do, Bill?

38:42.018 --> 38:43.952
Are you gonna kill me
with that thing?

38:43.954 --> 38:45.453
No, not this.

38:45.455 --> 38:47.055
Poison.

38:51.060 --> 38:53.561
Morgan: FBI, don't move.

38:53.563 --> 38:55.129
William Harding,
you're under arrest

38:55.131 --> 38:56.731
for the murders of Helen Mitchell,
Wayne Campbell,

38:56.733 --> 38:59.033
Carlos Ortega,
and Janice Cheswick.

38:59.035 --> 39:00.568
Drop the weapon--now.

39:00.570 --> 39:02.337
I think he poisoned me.
We'll get you to a hospital.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.038
But right now you need
to drop the weapon.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.176
No. He took 20 years
of my life from me.

39:08.178 --> 39:09.644
JJ: You got that
backwards.

39:09.646 --> 39:10.812
That shuttle bus,

39:10.814 --> 39:12.680
it crashed on the way
to the airport.

39:12.682 --> 39:14.315
All 5 people were killed.

39:14.317 --> 39:16.951
You not getting in that van
kept you alive.

39:21.757 --> 39:25.093
Now put it down.

39:50.052 --> 39:52.854
Rossi: "A person often
meets his destiny

39:52.856 --> 39:56.891
on the road he took
to avoid it."

39:56.893 --> 39:59.394
Jean de La Fontaine.

40:13.442 --> 40:14.475
Thanks.

40:14.477 --> 40:18.279
Given any more thought
to, um, career day?

40:18.281 --> 40:20.364
Jack's third-grade class

40:20.389 --> 40:22.518
is descending on the BAU
on Monday.

40:22.519 --> 40:24.385
Excellent.

40:24.387 --> 40:26.120
And is Jack happy
about it?

40:26.122 --> 40:27.588
Ecstatic.

40:27.590 --> 40:29.290
He's very excited.

40:29.292 --> 40:32.860
He's proud of you.

40:32.862 --> 40:35.063
I know.

40:35.065 --> 40:37.932
And I don't want to take
that away from him.

40:37.934 --> 40:42.136
The challenging part is coming up with
a profiling presentation.

40:42.138 --> 40:44.042
Well, after 20 years

40:44.067 --> 40:47.042
of facing down killers,
rapists, and psychopaths,

40:47.043 --> 40:52.513
SSA Aaron Hotchner
may have finally met his match.

40:53.994 --> 40:55.828
I've observed each of you.

40:55.830 --> 40:58.731
I've interrogated you.

40:58.733 --> 41:02.635
And none of you
claims to have the stapler.

41:02.637 --> 41:06.639
At first I thought it was you.

41:06.641 --> 41:09.475
But then...

41:09.477 --> 41:11.144
I profiled...

41:14.414 --> 41:17.116
That it's really you.

41:17.118 --> 41:19.485
[Kids cheering]

41:19.487 --> 41:21.454
Whoo-hoo!

41:21.456 --> 41:23.289
[Laughing]

41:23.291 --> 41:24.690
What exactly
did you profile?

41:24.692 --> 41:25.958
Well, a few things.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.593
First, Jesse, you wouldn't
look at me in the eye.

41:27.595 --> 41:29.428
But you were very
fidgety with your hands.

41:29.430 --> 41:31.497
And then when Ms. Garcia
dropped her lucky quarter,

41:31.499 --> 41:34.133
all 3 of you noticed,
but you didn't react at all.

41:34.135 --> 41:36.302
You were too busy keeping
a lie straight in your head.

41:36.304 --> 41:39.305
Well, this has been a very interesting
demonstration, Mr. Hotchner.

41:39.307 --> 41:40.606
Thank you, Ms. Springer.

41:40.608 --> 41:42.341
Class, let's all give him
a big thank-you.

41:42.343 --> 41:43.676
All: Thank you!

41:43.678 --> 41:44.744
You're welcome.

41:44.746 --> 41:47.313
Sir, may I show them
my office?

41:47.315 --> 41:49.182
Absolutely. Everybody
go with Ms. Garcia.

41:49.184 --> 41:51.350
Come on, you guys.
It's like the bat cave.

41:51.352 --> 41:54.520
[All chattering]

41:56.123 --> 41:58.457
Can I be a profiler
when I grow up?

41:58.459 --> 42:01.160
Sure, honey. If you get good grades
and you work hard

42:01.162 --> 42:03.062
and you think you might
be good at it, why not?

42:03.064 --> 42:04.197
I'm good at it.

42:04.199 --> 42:05.264
Are you?

42:05.266 --> 42:06.899
I did a profile
on Ms. Springer.

42:06.901 --> 42:08.267
Me?

42:08.269 --> 42:10.136
Yeah. You like
Jack's dad.

42:10.138 --> 42:11.504
I'm not sure--

42:11.506 --> 42:14.106
when you talk about
your cat, you talk real, real fast,

42:14.108 --> 42:15.641
because you really
like your cat.

42:15.643 --> 42:17.710
You talked real fast
like that today,

42:17.712 --> 42:19.445
not like with
the other dads.

42:19.447 --> 42:21.647
[Rapidly] Thanks again, Mr. Hotchner.
Thank you for the great time.

42:21.649 --> 42:22.882
You're welcome.

42:27.120 --> 42:30.389
Probably had to go
feed the cat.

42:31.425 --> 42:32.859
So how did I do?

42:32.861 --> 42:33.960
It was cool.

42:33.962 --> 42:36.095
It was cool.
So what do you say we celebrate?

42:36.097 --> 42:37.096
Yeah.

42:37.098 --> 42:38.264
Hot dogs or hamburgers?

42:38.266 --> 42:39.398
Both.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.301
I'm a profiler. I should
have seen that coming.
