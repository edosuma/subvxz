00:03.871 --> 00:07.241
[theme music]

01:01.162 --> 01:02.730
Mother, remember
when you told DJ

01:02.830 --> 01:05.032
if he got the hall bathroom
all disgusting he was gonna

01:05.133 --> 01:06.834
have to clean it up himself.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.603
Yes, and it's been
spotless ever since.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.139
Well, that's because
the little slob's

01:11.239 --> 01:13.207
been using our bathroom.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.909
Is that why I keep yanking
those huge wads of hair

01:16.009 --> 01:18.112
out of the drain?

01:18.212 --> 01:20.080
You know, one was in so
damn deep, I had to use

01:20.181 --> 01:23.083
your toothbrush to get it out.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.286
Ew!

01:25.386 --> 01:27.688
Hey, pig, quit washing
your hair in our sink.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.523
It's not my hair.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.758
Well then whose is it?

01:30.858 --> 01:34.462
Don't worry, it's dead.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.664
I'm moving.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.499
You know, of all the
people in the world

01:38.599 --> 01:43.036
to have as a role model, our
kid has to pick Eddie Munster.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.406
Oh, you're the one who thought
it'd be great to have a son.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.708
Well, it would've.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.077
Listen, I've got
to go down to Lobo.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.845
I'm meeting Davey.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.080
We're gonna have
a couple of beers

01:53.181 --> 01:55.816
and work up a bid for
the Hanover development.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.351
Well, you're not gonna
be too late, are ya?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.287
- Well, I don't know, why?
- Darlene, beat it.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.227
Don't you remember
what day it is?

02:06.327 --> 02:08.562
It's Wednesday.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.497
Oh yeah.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.235
I'll be back.

02:14.335 --> 02:18.672
I'll be here with bells on.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.241
Don't you wanna know how many?

02:20.341 --> 02:21.775
Surprise me.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.845
[growls playfully]

02:24.945 --> 02:27.315
[growls playfully]

02:27.415 --> 02:28.582
Don't come back all bloated.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.273
[sniffs]

03:26.474 --> 03:27.808
Ah-ha!

03:27.908 --> 03:30.978
A hair that isn't his.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.180
Oh, it's mine.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.682
[sniffs] Phew.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.624
[toilet flushing]

03:56.404 --> 03:58.272
[bang]

04:02.310 --> 04:04.144
[winces]

04:09.717 --> 04:10.518
Good.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.692
Have either of you seen
your dad this morning?

04:18.792 --> 04:19.593
Not me.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.994
There's a note on the counter.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.095
JACKIE: Hey!

04:22.195 --> 04:22.996
Hey.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.202
Geez.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.204
Mom, is everything OK?

04:31.305 --> 04:34.908
Yeah, there's more
orange juice in the fridge.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.412
Hey, Ma, can I have 5
bucks for no good reason?

04:38.512 --> 04:41.349
It's in my purse.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.050
Something's definitely wrong.

04:43.150 --> 04:43.951
Yep.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.520
I should've gone for $10.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.423
JACKIE: Hey, you
got any detergent?

04:49.523 --> 04:50.558
Yes.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.560
I have detergent.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.595
I have no marriage.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.096
Oh.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.766
So where's the detergent?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.601
Jackie, I'm serious.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.269
What'd Dan do now?

05:02.370 --> 05:06.039
It's what he didn't do
in the bedroom last night.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.642
Well, one night.

05:08.742 --> 05:12.112
Wednesday night, the night.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.146
You're kidding?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.649
You guys have a night?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.419
Yes, we have a night.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.622
It's not only Wednesday,
but it's always Wednesday.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.891
You got a time, too?

05:23.991 --> 05:27.761
Yeah, 20 minutes or
until he gets a cramp.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.498
Well, you should make him
wait half an hour after he eats.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.139
Come on, this has been
working for 17 years, you know?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.575
And then last night, he
comes in, crawling in here

05:41.675 --> 05:42.776
at like 3:00 in the morning.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.378
Then he's gone this
morning, leaving me a note.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.779
And it doesn't even
say he's sorry.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.681
So he missed one Wednesday.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.582
Two Wednesdays.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.183
OK, two Wednesdays.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.920
Don't worry about it, Roseanne.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.257
Around 14, you get numb.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.127
Hey, I'm not talking
about sexual frustration.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.295
I am.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.399
I think Dan's having
an affair, Jackie.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.967
Oh, come on!

06:07.067 --> 06:09.136
Dan?

06:09.236 --> 06:10.838
Why, you think he's ugly?

06:10.938 --> 06:11.939
You think he's stupid?

06:12.039 --> 06:12.940
You don't think there's
women out there that

06:13.040 --> 06:13.941
want to sleep with my husband?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.943
I think there's
plenty of women.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.911
There's millions of women
who'd like to sleep with Dan.

06:18.011 --> 06:18.812
Who?

06:18.912 --> 06:20.648
Tell me!

06:20.748 --> 06:22.783
You're really serious!

06:22.883 --> 06:23.684
Well, of course.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.352
I mean, he comes in late.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.821
He's totally preoccupied.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.790
And then, like, he's
laying there in bed making

06:29.890 --> 06:32.159
all these little happy noises.

06:32.259 --> 06:37.498
And if we're having Wednesday,
what's he so happy about?

06:37.598 --> 06:40.668
Come on, just because you
guys aren't having Wednesday

06:40.768 --> 06:43.737
doesn't mean that he's out
Wednesdaying somebody else.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.511
But isn't this what a man
does just before he walks out?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.212
What are you asking me for?

06:56.517 --> 06:57.585
All right.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.952
Well, we'll go
down the checklist.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.721
What's the first thing
he does when he comes in?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.122
He goes to the bathroom.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.757
[winces]

07:03.857 --> 07:05.425
What was that?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.227
Nothing.
It's not--

07:07.327 --> 07:08.328
That was a noise.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.363
It was like a checkmark
kind of a noise.

07:10.464 --> 07:15.402
I just-- [sighs] meant that
if you want to be suspicious,

07:15.503 --> 07:17.638
it could mean that he's washing
up so you don't smell any,

07:17.738 --> 07:19.873
like, perfume.

07:19.973 --> 07:24.645
I've been smelling Dan
as often as I can, Jackie.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.546
And?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.280
He smells like smoke.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.682
[winces]

07:28.782 --> 07:30.951
I know he doesn't smoke, and
he says he's going to the Lobo,

07:31.051 --> 07:33.086
and it does smell
like smoke down there.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.523
[winces]

07:35.623 --> 07:36.690
I want the house!

07:36.790 --> 07:38.726
He can have the kids, but
I'm keeping the house!

07:38.826 --> 07:41.495
Now, come on, Roseanne!

07:41.595 --> 07:43.664
This is Dan we're talking about.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.199
I think you owe him a
little bit of trust here.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.036
Just give him another chance.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.871
Yeah.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.673
Yeah, you're right.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.441
OK.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.076
What's the worst
that could happen?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.078
[winces]

08:01.682 --> 08:04.585
DAN: [moans with pleasure]

08:21.134 --> 08:23.136
Dan!

08:23.236 --> 08:24.037
Shh.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.939
It's my wife.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.676
Wake up!

08:28.776 --> 08:29.943
What?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.178
What were you doing?

08:31.278 --> 08:32.079
Sleeping.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.280
With who?

08:33.380 --> 08:35.783
[sighs] I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:41.454 --> 08:42.690
Who is she, Dan?

08:42.790 --> 08:43.691
Who's who?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.425
Are you cheating
on me Dan Conner?

08:45.525 --> 08:46.660
Where'd you get that from?

08:46.760 --> 08:47.961
Because I'm laying
there watching you

08:48.061 --> 08:48.996
slobber all over your pillow.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.530
You haven't slobbered
over me lately,

08:50.631 --> 08:52.600
so I wonder who you're
slobbering all over.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.401
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

08:54.501 --> 08:57.437
Then who is [slobbers].

08:57.537 --> 08:58.906
All right, Roseanne.

09:02.442 --> 09:06.413
I have been having a dream
about, you know, sex.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.048
But that doesn't mean
I'm cheating on you.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.549
It's just a dream?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.051
Yeah.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.320
Well, what are you
dreaming about, you and me?

09:13.420 --> 09:16.089
Sure, why not?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.224
I don't believe you, Dan.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.258
You come in late.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.526
You crawl in bed
with me, and you're

09:19.627 --> 09:20.828
dreaming about other women.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.429
Roseanne, you're blowing
this way out of proportion.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.563
It's not a lot of other women.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.166
It's just one woman.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.569
That did not help me.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.771
The same woman every time?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.205
At least I'm faithful.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.241
Roseanne!

09:34.341 --> 09:36.710
Roseanne, I'm
dreaming not cheating.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.046
You're dreaming
about cheating.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.648
I can't help it!

09:40.748 --> 09:44.084
So who is she, Dan, one of
those women in your magazines?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.285
Oh, give me some credit.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.620
You think I'd go for that?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.421
It's just a little redhead
down at the hardware

09:48.521 --> 09:49.456
store in the mall.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.357
Shut up, Dan.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.798
Rosie, I don't even know her.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.532
I don't know why I'm
dreaming about her.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.433
I just am.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.501
I can't help it.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.003
Look, look, it's late.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.337
We're both tired.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.206
Why don't we talk about
this in the morning?

10:06.306 --> 10:11.411
Oh, you can't wait to
get back to sleep, can you?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.146
Well, you're hitting
the couch, buddy.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.147
Roseanne.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.883
And take your
little tramp with ya.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.824
So anyway, you're
saying that you

10:23.924 --> 10:26.393
never, ever have these dreams?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.128
Well, yeah, I have
dreams like that,

10:28.228 --> 10:29.629
but they're always about Dan.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.265
Oh, that's so romantic.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.868
Of course he looks
like Sean Connery,

10:34.968 --> 10:38.806
you know, and he has that
accent, but I know it's Dan.

10:38.906 --> 10:39.707
Yeah, yeah.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.808
You're such a hypocrite.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.276
It's OK for you to dream
about Sean Connery,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.846
but it's not OK for Dan to dream
about some cute little redhead.

10:45.946 --> 10:46.747
I told you!

10:46.847 --> 10:49.082
It's not Sean Connery!

10:49.182 --> 10:51.719
Hey Roseanne, cup of coffee?

10:51.819 --> 10:54.688
We're trying to have a
private conversation here, Carl.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.655
What'd I say?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.758
I said cup of coffee.

10:57.858 --> 10:58.892
I've got a mall to protect.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.395
I'm not here to yak
about bikini wax.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.464
Though I've been known
to give a few in my time.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.939
One coffee to go.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.542
Hey, aren't you gonna
introduce me to your friends?

11:15.642 --> 11:19.646
Yes, that's my sister Jackie
and my girlfriend Crystal.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.482
Crystal, Jackie, this is Carl.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.416
He's a big loser.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.219
Would you like cream, Carl?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.588
Yes, thanks.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.223
Hey.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.025
Are you the sister who's a cop?

11:32.125 --> 11:35.228
Oh, yeah, but I'm
off the force now.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.830
Got hurt in the line of duty.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.433
Really, that's great.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.337
[sighs] God, I hope
to get hurt some day.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.505
You like guns?

11:45.605 --> 11:47.474
Because I got some
beauties at home.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.042
Maybe we can get together
one of these weekends

11:49.142 --> 11:51.845
and kill something.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.713
What?

11:53.814 --> 11:56.249
Well, what's good for
you, Friday, Saturday?

11:56.349 --> 11:57.184
Never.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.052
OK, good.
We'll leave it open.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.191
Well, see you ladies.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.092
Carl--

12:05.192 --> 12:08.829
Oh, don't call him back here.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.163
Yeah?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.465
You say you know
everyone in the mall.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.234
It's my job, Roseanne.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.702
Well, there's this woman--

12:15.803 --> 12:18.305
I know her.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.774
She works at Fillmore's
hardware store.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.375
She's the little redhead.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.377
Oh, Roseanne,
just let it drop.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.947
No, I wanna know what
she's got that I ain't got.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.381
You mean, Marge
Dolman over there?

12:28.481 --> 12:29.282
What about her?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.926
No way, no.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.660
Isn't there somebody
else that works there,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.396
some cute little foxy thing?

12:43.496 --> 12:44.297
Nope, she's it.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.572
Damn.

12:52.672 --> 12:53.473
She's cute!

13:00.647 --> 13:02.649
Why is he dreaming about her?

13:02.749 --> 13:04.918
Well, she could be younger.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.353
Yeah, maybe that's it.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.454
You think so?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.555
Oh, yeah.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.257
You're much older
than she is, Roseanne.

13:10.357 --> 13:14.061
Welp, you could be her mother.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.997
I'm going to pretend you
didn't say that, Crystal.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.399
Me too.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.468
Is anyone gonna tell
me what's going on?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.136
No.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.437
OK.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.006
I get it.

13:26.106 --> 13:26.907
I'm out of here.

13:30.777 --> 13:31.578
Call me.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.351
I'm gonna go over
and talk to her.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.452
No, don't, don't!

13:39.552 --> 13:41.521
Yeah, she's Dan's
dream woman, Jackie.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.890
I want to see what
it is about her.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.064
Hi, I'm your waitress, Roseanne
Conner, Dan's wife and mother

13:51.164 --> 13:53.400
of his three children.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.636
Can I order now?

13:56.736 --> 13:57.871
Yeah.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.473
I'll have a bacon,
lettuce, and tomato sandwich,

14:00.573 --> 14:02.709
but not in that order.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.745
Mayonnaise on the
bread, tomato, then

14:05.845 --> 14:10.217
lettuce, then bacon, whole
wheat toast, lightly toasted.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.619
Wait, put the mayo on the side.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.021
In fact, put
everything on the side.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.056
I'll put it together myself,
'cause you won't get it right.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.294
OK.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.100
Well?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.201
Well, she's not just cute.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.903
She's got a great personality.

14:40.513 --> 14:44.251
So Dad, rode the old
sofa again last night, eh?

14:44.351 --> 14:47.187
Mm.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.088
What's with you and Mom?

14:48.188 --> 14:49.889
You guys never sleep apart.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.859
No problem, I just fell
asleep watching the TV.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.793
Two nights in a row?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.930
- Shut up, Darlene.
- Come on, Dad.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.998
We're not little kids.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.933
If you and Mom are
having serious problems,

15:00.033 --> 15:01.801
I think you owe us the truth.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.203
Yeah, and enough
lead time to let us

15:03.303 --> 15:05.305
decide who we'd
like to live with.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.107
[doorbell ringing]

15:07.207 --> 15:08.608
I'll get it.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.543
[grunts]

15:15.015 --> 15:16.849
[grunts]

15:19.352 --> 15:20.887
Hi, Danny.

15:20.988 --> 15:21.788
Oh my god.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.789
What are you doing here?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.857
I waited until
your wife drove away.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.459
I just wanted to
see what you lived.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.995
Well, here it is.

15:28.095 --> 15:28.895
Bye.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.297
Uh, no, no thanks.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.764
We don't-- we don't
need a new religion.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.832
We already have one.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.368
Mind if I use the phone?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.269
Ooh!

15:36.369 --> 15:38.071
Is this your little boy?

15:38.171 --> 15:39.606
Aren't you adorable?

15:39.706 --> 15:40.840
Yep.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.076
You must get all your
good looks from your daddy.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.312
[chuckles] She's just
here to use the phone.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.879
There it is.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.780
Hurry.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.450
MARGE: [giggles]

15:50.550 --> 15:52.285
Did you see that?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.454
- I can't believe it.
- What?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.723
Dad, she was
flirting with you.

15:56.823 --> 15:57.824
What are you talking about?

15:57.924 --> 16:00.160
That religion lady
was coming on to you.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.594
You're crazy!

16:01.694 --> 16:03.863
Dad, she winked at you.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.035
You must get all your
good looks from "yo daddy"?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.902
It doesn't mean anything.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.571
(SING-SONGY) Dad's
got a girlfriend.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.472
Wait till Mom founds out.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.373
OK, that's it.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.507
Everybody goes to school.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.408
Come on.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.843
Is that lady my new mom?

16:16.943 --> 16:18.411
Yeah.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.779
Go on, scram.

16:19.879 --> 16:20.647
Get a job.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.086
How could you do this?

16:26.186 --> 16:28.321
Oh Danny, don't be mad.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.423
This is my home, my family.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.125
Oh, come on, Danny.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.495
I need you now!

16:35.595 --> 16:37.430
I said no.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.898
I am not asking, Danny.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.966
I am taking.

16:40.067 --> 16:40.867
Oh!

16:46.939 --> 16:49.309
Dan!

16:49.409 --> 16:50.577
I knew it!

16:50.677 --> 16:51.744
No, no, wait, Roseanne.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.979
This is a mistake.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.748
You bet it is!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.717
No!

16:57.817 --> 16:59.219
No, don't!

16:59.319 --> 17:01.221
Don't shoot!

17:01.321 --> 17:02.489
[gunshot]

17:02.589 --> 17:03.723
No, don't shoot!

17:03.823 --> 17:05.225
No!

17:05.325 --> 17:06.193
Dan?

17:06.293 --> 17:07.394
You want to wake
up the whole house?

17:07.494 --> 17:10.130
Oh geez, that was a bad one.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.999
What, did you and
Marge have a little tiff?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.967
Who?

17:15.068 --> 17:16.703
You know, your dream
girl from the hardware

17:16.803 --> 17:19.206
store, Marge Dolman.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.408
That's her name?

17:21.508 --> 17:23.743
Marge Dolman?

17:23.843 --> 17:26.713
Yeah, she came over
to the restaurant today.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.516
I thought she was cute, but
Jackie and Crystal both thought

17:29.616 --> 17:32.285
you could do a lot better.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.488
Oh, great, you told
Jackie and Crystal.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.923
Well, I have to know.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.225
I'm trying to
figure it out, Dan.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.393
I mean, what do you
see in this woman?

17:40.493 --> 17:41.561
Is she sexier than me?

17:41.661 --> 17:42.629
No.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.530
Does she make you laugh?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.698
No, no laughs.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.467
Is she better than me?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.368
I'm thirsty.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.269
You thirsty?

17:51.638 --> 17:52.539
Well, help me out here, Dan.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.773
I mean, I just can't understand.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.609
OK, if you were dreaming
about somebody like, oh say,

17:56.709 --> 18:01.080
Kathleen Turner, then I'd
just go, OK, he's a pig.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.583
But this woman, I mean,
I just don't get it, Dan.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.884
I don't know what it's about.

18:04.984 --> 18:05.785
I don't know.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.254
I hardly know her.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.055
I go to the hardware store.
I want something.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.457
She knows exactly
what aisle it's in.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.092
She knows exactly
what to charge me.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.963
So when you leave, you're
getting exactly what you want.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.265
I gotta lay down for this.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.466
OK, doc.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.434
I hated my father, and I
wanted to marry my mother.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.470
Go.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.507
Well, what is it that
she does in these dreams?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.708
Stop it.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.076
No, come on.

18:30.177 --> 18:34.281
I want to know what she does
in the dreams that's so great

18:34.381 --> 18:38.985
so I can, you know, do that.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.687
It's personal.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.588
I'm your wife.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.855
I wash your shorts.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.990
You can tell me.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.625
I can't.

18:45.725 --> 18:50.330
[sighs] Well, would it
help any if I was to tell

18:50.430 --> 18:53.099
you that I got some needs too?

18:56.736 --> 18:57.570
Like what?

18:57.670 --> 18:58.471
I asked you first.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.507
I asked you second.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.141
You tell me.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.377
All right.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.646
All right.

19:06.746 --> 19:12.419
In the dream, she treats
me like I'm some kind

19:12.519 --> 19:13.986
of irresistible sex toy.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.125
Get out of here!

19:19.226 --> 19:23.696
I'm so glad I got
that off my chest.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.065
That's what you like?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.768
Go away.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.737
No, Dan, I mean,
how come we can do it

19:30.837 --> 19:33.406
but we can't talk about it?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.975
I mean, maybe-- maybe you think
we're in some kind of a rut,

19:36.075 --> 19:37.176
you know?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.246
Maybe you-- maybe you
want to try something new?

19:44.517 --> 19:48.655
Well, maybe we could
forget about Wednesdays

19:48.755 --> 19:53.693
and try to be a little
more, you know, spontaneous.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.662
OK, fine.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.596
Now, this is great.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.497
See, we're talking.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.332
It's great.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.300
What else?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.201
That's it.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.537
Well, what does
she do in the dream?

20:04.637 --> 20:07.073
Roseanne, this is
really tough for me.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.008
I know, but it's
healthy, honey.

20:09.108 --> 20:09.909
Please.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.110
Come on, tell me.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.984
[whispers]

20:20.420 --> 20:21.220
Dream on!

20:29.596 --> 20:30.497
Here!

20:30.597 --> 20:31.398
Oh!

20:31.498 --> 20:32.465
He loves me.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.501
He loves me not.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.968
One more, Roseanne.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.170
He He loves me.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.139
Oh, looky, looky, looky.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.776
DAN: Oh please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,

20:43.876 --> 20:46.045
please, please, please, please.

20:46.145 --> 20:46.946
Hi, Marge.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.815
Oh god.

20:48.915 --> 20:53.019
I wanted to say thanks,
and I'll take it from here.

20:53.119 --> 20:53.920
OK?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.391
What'd you think
I was gonna say?

20:58.491 --> 20:59.526
I don't know.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.628
You're capable of doing
anything at any time.

21:01.728 --> 21:06.132
Yes, crazy,
impulsive, spontaneous.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.468
Get in here.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.337
DAN: Roseanne, we're
in an elevator!

21:10.437 --> 21:11.237
ROSEANNE: So?

21:11.338 --> 21:12.138
Hurry up!

21:18.845 --> 21:22.081
[theme music]
