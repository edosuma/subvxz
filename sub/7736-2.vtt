Do you want to tell me what this is?

00:27.161 --> 00:30.874
- What?
- This. This failure notice from your school?

00:30.957 --> 00:33.292
If you're an expert on what it is,
why did you have to ask me?

00:33.376 --> 00:35.420
Don't start. Honestly, Kevin,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.797
you're in danger of failing
every class you have.

00:37.881 --> 00:39.298
[mumbles] Not every class.
I'm acing speech.

00:39.382 --> 00:42.134
- What did you say?
- I said I'm acing speech!

00:42.218 --> 00:44.971
Aah! Your father's gonna
have an absolute stroke,

00:45.055 --> 00:46.932
and you can clean him with a sponge.

00:47.015 --> 00:48.892
- Fine, I will!

- Leave your sister alone.
- All right, all right, all right!

00:55.440 --> 00:57.525
Can't I have one day
without any upsetment?

00:57.609 --> 00:59.318
I'm gonna ride to the railroad tracks.

00:59.402 --> 01:00.987
- Oh, no, you are not.
- Yeah, I am.

01:01.071 --> 01:02.739
Honestly, do you think
you get to live your life

01:02.822 --> 01:04.908
not doing anything your
mother wants... [all arguing]

01:04.991 --> 01:07.994
...not following any of your mother's
rules, just to make her go insane?

01:08.078 --> 01:09.871
You are gonna make me
go completely insane.

01:09.955 --> 01:12.958
That is what's gonna happen.

Oh, hiya, honey. Mm. 
How was your day?

01:59.838 --> 02:03.382
Ah, it was a rough one. I had to
help Ed's widow clean out his locker.

02:03.466 --> 02:06.240
- Oh, that poor woman.
- One minute everything's fine,

02:06.241 --> 02:08.086
Ed's walking around the tarmac with his

02:08.086 --> 02:09.931
head attached to his
body like it always is.

- Chair.

Oh, don't start with me,
you fuckin' disappointment.

02:19.107 --> 02:21.567

If you don't like this,

03:12.375 --> 03:15.205
go to your room and watch
whatever you want on your TV.

- Aside from your haircut? What?
- [Kevin] This.

- No.

- This!
- What the hell is this?

- Kevin!
- He's flunking out and you knew about this?

03:34.265 --> 03:38.103
- I wanted your food to settle!
- Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

03:38.186 --> 03:41.189
You got one job: pay attention
and pass your classes.

03:41.272 --> 03:44.358
- That's two jobs!
- No son of mine is gonna flunk out.

03:44.442 --> 03:46.236
I don't care. I hate school!

03:46.318 --> 03:48.362
Well, I hate my life,
but I keep on doing it!

03:48.446 --> 03:50.615
I got a mortgage, I got dependents,

03:50.698 --> 03:54.493

damn day to run that airport!

- As beautiful as it is...
- [chuckles] Right.

05:38.139 --> 05:40.725
Ew. Daddy, Bill flicked
his cereal at me.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.643
- Knock it off, Bill.
- She started it.

around the neighborhood.

- It's called Plast-A-Ware!
- You're right. Plast-A-Ware.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.919
So while Mommy's busy
with her little hobby...

06:08.002 --> 06:10.338
- It's a job!
- Yes, fine, a job.

each other and don't get in any trouble.

06:13.549 --> 06:15.425

charge of your sister today.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.510
- You got that?
- Yep.

06:16.594 --> 06:20.181
Okay, if anything bad happens to her,
I want you to call me at work.

06:20.265 --> 06:21.599
- Okay, buddy?
- Sure, Dad.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.726
Good, 'cause then I
will come right home,

06:23.809 --> 06:26.229
and I will put you
through that fuckin' wall.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.815
Have a great day, princess.

06:29.107 --> 06:31.650
- Dad put me in charge of you.
- Good for you.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.903
- So you have to do what I say.
- Okay.

06:33.986 --> 06:36.781
- Can I go get my coloring book?
- Yes, you can.

- Hey. Get up, son.
- [sleepy voice] Oh, come on,

06:57.593 --> 07:00.012
I was having a dream about
not being part of this family.

07:00.096 --> 07:01.639
That's great. 
Come on. It's important.

07:04.058 --> 07:05.101
Where you taking me?

07:09.897 --> 07:12.483
Hey, Frank! She wouldn't leave.

- Capricorns, right?
- Ah, that guy.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.573
Where we going?

07:21.284 --> 07:22.534
I'm not getting a haircut.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.914
Look, I'm sorry I'm flunking out, 
but History's not my fault.

07:26.998 --> 07:29.834
I wasn't gonna say this,
but Mr. Hackett's a perv.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.628
Like, a major perv. He's
always brushing up against me.

07:32.711 --> 07:34.955
I'm pretty sure I gave him a boner.

07:40.052 --> 07:43.555
Look, I realize no matter how much I yell
and scream, you're never gonna change.

07:43.639 --> 07:46.851
<i>You're not gonna do better in school,

07:46.934 --> 07:48.477
We're not gonna fight
you on this anymore.

07:48.478 --> 07:50.021
So I guess you're done with school.

07:50.104 --> 07:51.814
And you know what? That's fine.

07:51.897 --> 07:56.402
- Oh. Cool.
- So we decided to sell you to the Army.

07:56.486 --> 07:57.611
- What?
- Yep.

07:57.695 --> 08:00.695
- You are going to Vietnam.
- What?

08:02.033 --> 08:05.119
It's called "Troubled Youths To
Southeast Asia," or something like that.

08:05.203 --> 08:08.039
- It's an early-induction program.
- What the hell are you talking about?!

08:08.122 --> 08:11.125
Good, good, that's great. Get all
that attitude outta your system now,

08:11.209 --> 08:14.170
because your commanding officer's
probably not gonna stand for it.

08:14.253 --> 08:15.963
You can't do this to me. It isn't legal.

08:16.047 --> 08:19.133
Yeah, it is. It's a new program. 
A lot of parents are really excited about it.

08:19.217 --> 08:21.302
It's a "can't lose."
You're done with school,

08:21.386 --> 08:23.388
and we might get a nice
folded flag out of it.

08:23.471 --> 08:25.494
Ah, would you look at
that. Hey, we better hurry,

08:25.495 --> 08:27.517
<i>your flight to Saigon leaves in an hour.</i>

08:27.599 --> 08:29.894

<i>Where are you taking me?!</i>

08:44.616 --> 08:45.951
[inhaling]

08:46.035 --> 08:49.080
Mm... [sighs]
here we go!

08:49.163 --> 08:51.749
You can't do this to me!
Wait, I'll be good!

08:51.832 --> 08:54.313
- Father, please!
- Oh, and if you see a six-year-old

08:54.314 --> 08:57.671
running away from you, he's
about to compromise your position.

08:57.755 --> 09:00.758
So, what you want to do is shoot
him right in the back of the head.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.177
A brain stem shot. All right?
And don't worry, don't worry,

09:03.261 --> 09:04.970
- everything's fair game over there.
- No!

09:05.054 --> 09:07.806
You hold him up on your
bayonet for the others to see.

09:07.890 --> 09:11.185
- It's all about sending a message.
- [sobbing] I want to go home, Daddy!

09:11.269 --> 09:13.479
Ah, we all want to go home, Kevin.

09:13.563 --> 09:16.232
But sometimes you have to
destroy an entire culture first

09:16.315 --> 09:18.817
before that's possible.
And I'll tell you right now,

09:18.901 --> 09:21.003
if the Vietnamese are
anything like the Koreans,

09:21.004 --> 09:24.698
- they're very tough to de-bone.
- No, please! I'm so sorry!

09:24.782 --> 09:26.992
I don't even know what a brain stem is!

09:27.076 --> 09:29.787
I'll work hard in school!
I'll be good, okay?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.997
D-D-Don't send me to Vietnam!

09:32.081 --> 09:35.334
Jesus Christ, Kevin.
You're not going to Vietnam.

09:35.418 --> 09:37.169
What? I'm not?

09:37.253 --> 09:39.755
You really think they'd
take a 14-year-old flunky?

09:39.838 --> 09:41.799
They only take 18-year-old flunkies.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.935
Seriously? That's so fucked up!

09:45.344 --> 09:47.138
<i>[Frank] You are gonna
spend the day with me.</i>

09:47.221 --> 09:50.099
<i>So you see what I do to put food
on the table for this family.</i>

09:50.182 --> 09:52.810
Then maybe you'll learn to
have just a little more respect

09:52.893 --> 09:55.521
for your "just a
baggage handler" father.

09:55.605 --> 09:58.857
Ah! Piece of shit! Goddamn it!
[door slams]

09:58.941 --> 10:02.153

- You remember my boy, Kevin, right?
- Oh, hey, kid. You've grown.

10:25.343 --> 10:27.219
What are you in,
seventh, eighth grade now?

10:27.303 --> 10:29.305
- [scoffs] Try ninth.
- Shit.

10:29.388 --> 10:33.601
Time sure flies when
you work 51 weeks a year.

10:35.686 --> 10:37.563

Don't throw that!

10:58.584 --> 11:01.003
If Maureen gets hurt,
my dad's gonna kill me!

11:01.086 --> 11:04.590
- I won't get hurt.
- It's okay, we's insulated.

11:04.674 --> 11:09.080
- I think I'm allergic to my pink pillow.
- This is stupid.

11:09.115 --> 11:11.305
Let's just play something
where Maureen won't get hurt.

11:11.389 --> 11:12.722
OK.
[groans]

11:12.806 --> 11:16.101
Ah, shit! 
Why does this hurt so much?

11:16.185 --> 11:20.113
Should've worn a cup, like me.
[chuckles]

11:21.524 --> 11:23.609
<i>[Frank] Now let me show you where you</i>

11:23.610 --> 11:26.737
<i>can get in life when you stay
in school. This right here</i>

11:26.738 --> 11:29.865
is what you call the "nerve center" 
of the whole operation.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.680
You recognize that handwriting?

11:32.681 --> 11:37.039
- That's me. I made out that schedule.
- Gee, Pop, that's cool.

11:37.122 --> 11:40.903
It's not "cool." It's important.
Just like air traffic control.

11:40.938 --> 11:42.878
It's all about sequencing and spacing.

11:42.961 --> 11:45.214
- [scoffs] Of lunch?
- No, of everything.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.883
Without that schedule, the
bags don't get off the planes

11:47.966 --> 11:51.303
and the whole airport grinds to a halt.
That leads to a domino effect.

11:51.387 --> 11:54.098
Every airport closes.
Then anarchy sets in.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.059
- Food lines grow...
- Dad, it's not that big of a deal.

11:57.142 --> 11:59.645
Yeah? Talk to me when we're
eating the fucking dog for supper!

11:59.729 --> 12:02.648
<i>[man shouts over PA]
Murphy! My office! Now!</i>

12:02.732 --> 12:05.859
All right, that's the big boss.
I'll be right back. You stay here.

12:05.943 --> 12:08.320
Do not move your ass from this spot. 
You understand me, Einstein?

12:08.404 --> 12:11.990
- All right. Yeah, Dad, I got it.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

12:12.074 --> 12:16.203
[door closes]
[singsong] # Fuck you. #

12:18.015 --> 12:19.289
_

12:19.290 --> 12:21.709
No fucking door's gonna
tell me what to do.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.496
[horn beeps]
Ah, shit!

12:32.261 --> 12:34.138
Mm-hm. Hm. Hm.

12:36.515 --> 12:38.768
Ooh. You're a bad one.

12:42.104 --> 12:44.273
See? This is fun, right?

12:44.356 --> 12:45.983
- I guess.
- And it's safe.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.985
- You guys ready?
- All ready.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.245
Hold your girl balls!

12:51.447 --> 12:53.532
[giggling]

12:55.451 --> 12:58.203
[gasps, grunting]

12:58.287 --> 12:59.622
[tires screeching]

13:01.999 --> 13:03.125
Shit!

13:03.208 --> 13:07.879
- Maureen! I killed her.
- I want to do it again!

13:07.963 --> 13:10.675
No! I don't care if
you die, but Dad does.

13:10.758 --> 13:13.594
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Are you all right, Maureen?

13:13.678 --> 13:15.554
The Nazi knows my name!

13:15.638 --> 13:16.806
[kids screaming]

13:16.888 --> 13:20.058
Ah! The joy of children at play.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.313
[knocking]
[door opens]

13:24.396 --> 13:27.426
- You, uh, wanted to see me, Bob?
- Sit down.

13:27.427 --> 13:30.709
[loud, labored breathing]

13:33.531 --> 13:37.207
Frank, it was a horrible
way for you to get Ed's job,

13:37.236 --> 13:40.454
God rest his soul, but
everything happens for a reason

13:40.538 --> 13:44.458
and I know you're the guy 
to turn this department around.

13:44.542 --> 13:46.043
Thank you.

13:46.126 --> 13:50.047
To be honest with you, Ed
lost control of his crew.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.300
You see how they've been acting
out there? [sputtering cough]

13:53.384 --> 13:56.846
Oh, did I get you? 
There's no discipline anymore.

13:56.928 --> 14:01.809
So you're the new sheriff and I'm
counting on you to lay down the law.

14:02.768 --> 14:06.564
Good skin.
They should make a chicken just of skin.

14:06.647 --> 14:09.650
I'd buy that. Everybody'd buy that.

14:09.734 --> 14:13.028
To tell you the truth, we were
getting ready to let Ed go anyway.

14:13.111 --> 14:18.033
So this terrible accident was
kind of a blessing in disguise.

14:18.116 --> 14:20.285
[grunting, gasping]

14:20.369 --> 14:21.995
[groaning]

14:23.873 --> 14:26.500
One good thing has come
out of this tragedy.

14:26.584 --> 14:30.462
From now on, if you're
wearing a tie on the tarmac,

14:30.546 --> 14:34.299
- it's gotta be a clip-on.
- That's a nice way to honor his memory.

14:34.383 --> 14:38.241
So listen, I'm hearing some
rumblings that Rosie and

14:38.242 --> 14:42.099
the baggage handlers are
thinking of going on strike.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.687
I'm really counting on you to
make sure your men understand

14:46.771 --> 14:50.357
that wouldn't be in
anybody's best interest.

14:50.441 --> 14:51.508
Oh, they're not gonna strike.

14:51.509 --> 14:55.195
- They're my guys. They're reasonable.
- That's good.

14:55.230 --> 14:59.032
Because just between you
and me and these pieces of poultry,

14:59.116 --> 15:01.786
a strike would kill this airline.

15:01.869 --> 15:05.539
Times are tough. 
Inflation. Recession.

15:05.623 --> 15:09.418
Oil embargo.
 We're all in this together.

15:09.501 --> 15:11.044
If one side...

15:11.128 --> 15:15.966
Oh, for Christ's sake, this
bucket's only got three biscuits!

15:16.049 --> 15:17.968
<i>It's supposed to have four!</i>

15:18.051 --> 15:20.596
That's what's wrong with
this country! [bucket thuds]

15:21.639 --> 15:24.391
[grunts] Oh, here it is.

15:25.183 --> 15:31.118
You're in management now, Frank,
and we take care of our own. Here.

15:31.523 --> 15:35.451
We'd like you to have
these, courtesy of our CEO,

15:35.452 --> 15:38.071
<i>Roger Dunbarton himself. [grunts]</i>

15:38.155 --> 15:41.784
These are for the game next
Sunday. Corporate seats!

15:41.867 --> 15:44.787
Enjoy them. 
You're on our team now.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.789
I know you'll come through for us

15:46.872 --> 15:50.542
and shut down any of this
crazy talk about a strike.

15:50.626 --> 15:55.172
- I can count on you, right?
- [clears throat] Uh... Yes. Yes, sir.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.142
- All right, Frank, we're done here.
- Thanks, Bob.

16:00.928 --> 16:03.463
I'm not a stander, Frank.

16:05.641 --> 16:07.852
<i>Bang it harder, man!
[man grunts]</i>

16:07.935 --> 16:09.269
<i>I'm trying, I'm trying!</i>

16:09.353 --> 16:11.271
<i>Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on!</i>

16:11.355 --> 16:13.524
Come on, you little fuckers!

16:13.607 --> 16:17.194
Ho-ho! All right, high tar!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.196
- Makes your dick hard.
- Oh, hey, man.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.739
It's not stealing if you're on a break.

16:20.823 --> 16:24.159
- Oh, shit, that's Frank's kid.
- Are you gonna tell your dad on us?

16:24.242 --> 16:27.329
My dad's a dildo. Now how
about one of those cigarettes?

16:27.412 --> 16:30.081
- All right.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

16:40.091 --> 16:41.092
There.

16:41.844 --> 16:42.970
All done.

16:43.053 --> 16:46.974
[sighs] Now I'm free to
enjoy the rest of my day.

16:47.057 --> 16:51.255
[clock ticking]
[faucet dripping]

16:54.023 --> 16:57.010
[ticking echoes]

17:11.205 --> 17:14.041
[sobbing]

17:19.714 --> 17:22.175
[wailing]

17:23.761 --> 17:27.137
[muffled sobs]
[whining]

17:28.348 --> 17:31.393
<i>[sobbing] Oh, God!</i>

17:36.815 --> 17:39.651
<i>Get out of here! 
Leave me alone!</i>

17:39.735 --> 17:41.445
<i>Get out! Ew!</i>

17:42.654 --> 17:44.531
All right, Einstein. Up and at 'em!

17:45.699 --> 17:47.242
Ah, shit!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.037
[horn beeps]
[gasps]

17:51.496 --> 17:52.873
Maureen!

17:52.957 --> 17:56.209
You said you'd only climb
to the first big branch!

17:56.293 --> 17:58.420
When are you gonna realize I'm a liar?

17:58.503 --> 18:00.505
Hey, look, free eggs!

18:01.256 --> 18:04.217
Yuck. Somebody put a bird in this one!

18:04.301 --> 18:06.511
Maureen, get down now!

18:06.595 --> 18:08.831
[singsong] # I can't hear you #

18:08.866 --> 18:10.170
[yelling]
[gasps]

18:13.018 --> 18:14.394
[thudding]

18:14.478 --> 18:16.814
<i>So he forces me to come
with him on his day off</i>

18:16.897 --> 18:18.607
to learn respect for what he does.

18:18.690 --> 18:22.903
And it's all 'cause he spazzed out
when I started flunking a few classes.

18:22.987 --> 18:23.862
[coughs]

18:23.946 --> 18:28.033
Fuck school! Whoa!
That'd be a great name for a porno.

18:28.117 --> 18:30.452
Look at that, I didn't
even finish tenth grade

18:30.535 --> 18:32.913
and I just came up with
an idea for a movie.

18:32.997 --> 18:36.291
People still go to
school, but they fuck.

18:36.374 --> 18:38.877
I'd watch that.
Everybody would watch that.

18:38.961 --> 18:42.547
Carl, check it out! This
one just came in from Boston.

18:43.173 --> 18:45.342
"Lewis Futon." Nice.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.636
She's probably banging
the mayor. [chortles]

18:47.719 --> 18:50.263
Better put it on the belt. Oops!

18:50.347 --> 18:51.974
<i>Missed the belt!</i>

18:52.057 --> 18:55.602
"Leonora Pender." 
Oh, you dirty pill-billy.

18:55.686 --> 18:58.105
- What are they?
- Only one way to find out.

18:58.188 --> 19:01.817
And that's why they call it
"experimenting" with drugs.

19:03.318 --> 19:06.321
- Whoa. Can I have some?
- Dude, you're a kid!

19:06.404 --> 19:08.323
You can only have one.

19:09.366 --> 19:10.367
Whoa.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.237
- You're gonna be a great father.
- Thanks, man.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.000
- Rosie, you seen my kid?
- Thought he was with you.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.836
Ah, geez. Kid's gonna put
me six feet under. Thanks.

19:20.919 --> 19:22.203
Frank, real quick, real quick.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.131
What did Bob Pogo want
to talk to you about?

19:24.214 --> 19:26.758
Well, uh... he was missing a biscuit.

19:26.842 --> 19:28.969
[laughing]

19:29.887 --> 19:32.165
I didn't do it!

19:33.306 --> 19:35.684
Anyway, what did he want, Frank?

19:35.767 --> 19:38.687
Pogo was just, you know, he
doesn't want you to go on strike.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.605
And look, I know you guys got a beef.

19:40.689 --> 19:42.440
They shouldn't be
cutting your overtime pay.

19:42.524 --> 19:46.132
Exactly. It isn't right. I mean,
we're busting our asses out here.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.738
How much money they gotta make?

19:47.821 --> 19:51.867
We're not asking for a lot, man, you
know, just spread it around a little bit.

19:51.950 --> 19:53.368
I mean, you understand, right?

19:53.451 --> 19:56.371
Rosie, you know I got your back.
I'll always be one of you guys.

19:56.454 --> 19:59.499
If this shit goes down,
we can count on you, right?

19:59.583 --> 20:01.292
Yeah, Rosie. Of course you can.

20:01.376 --> 20:04.254
- Good.
- I better go find my kid.

20:04.337 --> 20:08.013
Hey, I hope Pogo didn't eat him!
[both laughing]

20:08.050 --> 20:10.572
He's too lean, though, right?
[chuckles]

20:10.844 --> 20:14.806
- Ah...
- Excuse me, are you the manager here?

20:14.890 --> 20:17.184
Why, yes, ma'am, I am.
How can I help you?

20:17.267 --> 20:18.894
Don't you backtalk me!

20:22.689 --> 20:25.109
- Are you all right?
- Do you want my pillow?

20:25.192 --> 20:28.445
- Get away from her!
- I... can't... breathe!

20:28.528 --> 20:30.239
You just got the wind
knocked out of you.

20:31.115 --> 20:33.825
I bet I can go higher this... time.

20:33.909 --> 20:37.454
Jesus Christ, Maureen,
what's wrong with you?!

20:37.537 --> 20:40.498
All day long, if it's not
one thing, it's another!

20:40.582 --> 20:42.626
I'm just trying to protect you!

20:42.709 --> 20:45.623
Do you have a death wish,
you stupid fuck?!

20:45.754 --> 20:47.714
[gasps, sniffles]

20:48.465 --> 20:51.468
Ah, shit. [sighs]

20:51.551 --> 20:54.763
I'm sorry. Okay. Okay.

20:54.846 --> 20:57.224
Can you walk, or do you
want me to carry you?

20:57.307 --> 21:03.063
[sniffles] I can walk, but I
still want you to carry me, okay?

21:11.321 --> 21:13.364
<i>[Kevin] I know that guy.
That's my dad's boss.</i>

21:13.448 --> 21:16.409
It is for about two more seconds.
[chuckling] Here he goes.

21:16.493 --> 21:19.913
<i>Alive... alive... alive...</i>

21:20.497 --> 21:21.331
<i>[yells]
[men] Oh!</i>

21:21.414 --> 21:23.708
- What happened to his head?!
- Just a second.

21:24.168 --> 21:25.543
Holy shit!
[men cackling]

21:25.627 --> 21:27.171
- I can't stop watching this.
- Oh, man!

21:27.254 --> 21:30.381
<i>Look, look. Alive. Dead.</i>

21:30.465 --> 21:32.259
<i>Alive. Dead.</i>

21:32.342 --> 21:33.760
<i>Alive. Dead.</i>

21:33.844 --> 21:35.512
<i>I'm gonna put him back together. Oh!</i>

21:35.595 --> 21:37.722
<i>Now he's apart. 
I use Head and Shoulders.</i>

21:37.806 --> 21:39.808
<i>Oops! Now just Shoulders.
 [giggles]</i>

21:39.891 --> 21:43.394
Oh, don't get ahead of yourself!
The Prince of Darkness says you live!

21:43.478 --> 21:44.855
<i>Oh, no, you don't!</i>

21:44.938 --> 21:47.899
Uh, my... dad's probably...

21:47.983 --> 21:50.235
- I should go find him.
- Okay, see ya.

21:50.319 --> 21:52.904
"I wear a tie because
I'm a professional."

21:52.988 --> 21:54.823
Not anymore.
[both cackling]

21:57.326 --> 22:00.495
I'm sorry you had to see
all that, but I'm fine now.

22:00.578 --> 22:03.540
Really, I am. I'm very happy.

22:03.623 --> 22:07.878
I mean, so what if all I really have is...
I'm a mom and a wife.

22:07.961 --> 22:10.964
And all I have outside
of that is Plast-A-Ware.

22:11.048 --> 22:14.009
But I'm happy.
I don't need anything else.

22:14.092 --> 22:16.803
No, no, no, don't go. 
Here, more cheese.

22:18.096 --> 22:20.431
I'm really very happy.

22:20.515 --> 22:21.641
<i>[door opens]
[Bill] Mom?</i>

22:21.725 --> 22:24.393
We'll talk later.
Hang on, honey, Mommy's here!

22:24.477 --> 22:27.314
[stammers] Mrs. Pender,
I am so very sorry

22:27.396 --> 22:29.774
that something was lost
from your luggage in transit.

22:29.858 --> 22:34.071
It's not "something." It's my pills.
And they were in that bag!

22:34.154 --> 22:36.698
They're for my uterine lining!

22:36.781 --> 22:38.783
Are you sure you packed
them before you left Boston?

22:38.867 --> 22:42.954
Are you suggesting I'm senile, 
you baggage jockey?

22:43.038 --> 22:44.998
<i>This is your fault!</i>

22:45.082 --> 22:49.169
You are an absolute disgrace
to this once-proud airline.

22:49.253 --> 22:51.213
<i>And if you think I'm gonna stand...</i>

22:51.296 --> 22:53.506
Whoa!
[men cackling]

22:53.590 --> 22:55.675
You should see the tape

22:59.428 --> 23:01.147
You guys should get back to work.

23:02.349 --> 23:05.518
Oh, man, I got the cramps something bad.

23:05.602 --> 23:10.107
- Really? Are your breasts tender?
- No, but I can't feel my balls!

23:10.190 --> 23:12.441
Murphy, ma'am. Frank Murphy.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.237
Well, Frank Murphy, you're
about to lose your job!

23:15.320 --> 23:19.991
Excuse me, sir? Um...
I don't know your name, obviously,

23:20.075 --> 23:23.494
but um, I found this bottle
by the baggage carousel

23:23.578 --> 23:25.622
and just thought it might be important?

23:25.705 --> 23:28.457
Oh. Uh... 
Thank you, uh, young man.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.918
Mrs. Pender, here you are.

23:30.001 --> 23:33.213
Oh. Well, this still
doesn't excuse your rudeness.

23:33.297 --> 23:34.881
Ma'am, I am terribly sorry.

23:34.965 --> 23:37.092
It's 100 percent our fault.
I understand completely.

23:37.175 --> 23:41.012
And your complete lack of
professionalism and respect for...

23:41.096 --> 23:44.682
Excuse me, but um...
why don't you just...

23:44.766 --> 23:47.301
[yelling] shut the fuck up?!

24:02.033 --> 24:04.577
Kevin... you shouldn't have said that.

24:04.661 --> 24:08.397
That was very rude. 
[laughing]

24:08.873 --> 24:11.542
And just because I'm laughing
doesn't make it right, okay?

24:11.626 --> 24:13.462
You should've shown
that lady some respect.

24:13.544 --> 24:17.799
- Why? She'll be dead in a week.
- Yeah, with any luck. [laughing]

24:17.882 --> 24:22.304
- She sure was pissed.
- Yeah, don't tell your mother!

24:22.305 --> 24:24.109

24:44.368 --> 24:47.704
[turns down volume]
Doesn't that just rock your soul?

24:47.787 --> 24:50.040
I gotta tell ya, I-I just don't get it.

24:50.123 --> 24:53.293
Dad, you can't understand
progressive rock for the first time.

24:53.377 --> 24:56.833
- You gotta keep listening.
- No, I don't. When you get to be my age,

24:56.868 --> 24:58.340
you can recognize bullshit
right out of the gate.

24:58.423 --> 25:02.927
So listen, my boss gave me these
tickets to the game next Sunday.

25:03.011 --> 25:05.596
Corporate seats. You want to go?

25:05.680 --> 25:08.892
Really? Yeah, sure. Thanks, Dad.

25:08.975 --> 25:12.270
- Cool.
- Yeah. It'll be fun.

25:13.771 --> 25:16.233
Dad, I'm real sorry about my grades.

25:16.316 --> 25:20.320
I'm gonna stop goofing off and
make up all my assignments, I swear.

25:20.404 --> 25:23.031
Okay. Good. 
That would really make me proud.

25:23.114 --> 25:25.325
And I'm glad you took
me to your job today.

25:25.409 --> 25:27.244
It really opened my eyes.

25:27.327 --> 25:29.662
I shouldn't have called you
"just a baggage handler."

25:29.746 --> 25:33.333
- What you do is... remarkable.
- Ah...

25:34.376 --> 25:39.172
- Thanks, son.
- I mean, what an awful job you have.

25:39.256 --> 25:42.780
Seriously, watching you just
have to stand there while

25:42.781 --> 25:46.304
that lady came down on you,
you were like a human urinal.

25:46.388 --> 25:49.266
- I was... I was embarrassed for you.
- Okay.

25:49.349 --> 25:51.600
I mean, like, the humiliation.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.937
- Your soul must be weeping.
- Got it.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.648
<i>[Kevin] I don't know how the
human spirit can endure that.</i>

25:57.732 --> 26:03.196
She was literally, like, shoveling
her own feces in your mouth.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.822
And you just kept eating it.

26:04.906 --> 26:07.409
- Yeah, you said that already.
- No, I said "urinal."

26:07.492 --> 26:10.161
Anyway, I don't know how you do it.

26:10.245 --> 26:11.662
Day in and day out...
[turns up volume]

26:11.746 --> 26:13.164

26:16.376 --> 26:18.462

<i>No. No, I don't...</i>
