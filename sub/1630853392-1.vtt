04:20.394 --> 04:23.297

- You know you wanna dance.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.951
Okay, worst hangover ever.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.752
I mean, easy, that's tomorrow.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.056
Best hangover cure?

04:49.090 --> 04:51.658
Um, pancakes and syrup?

04:51.691 --> 04:54.061
Easy, it's Tequila.

04:54.095 --> 04:55.262
Tequila!

04:55.296 --> 04:57.965
- To friends!
- To amigos!

04:57.998 --> 05:00.267
Salud!

05:02.369 --> 05:03.838
Aghh!

05:03.871 --> 05:05.282
Let me help you out there,
baby girl.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.975
Alright, line 'em up.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.144
Bad news.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.213
- Time to play spin the bottle?
- Yeah!

05:12.246 --> 05:14.915
Okay, and then, and then
the loser has to go to the bar.

05:14.949 --> 05:16.383
- Yeah!
- Yeah, alright, okay!

05:16.417 --> 05:18.751
Whoa...!

05:20.254 --> 05:22.789

05:22.823 --> 05:26.060
- Okay, beers? Beers, beers?
- Beers!

05:26.093 --> 05:28.295
And don't forget the Tequila!

05:35.035 --> 05:36.871
She better not come back
with water.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.039
Oh, you know she's gonna
drink water.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.975
That's Nat in a nutshell.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.705
Hi, Mom and Billy!

06:12.739 --> 06:14.741
I just wanna say
I really miss you guys.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.443
Can't wait to see you.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.380
<i>Por favor.</i>

06:19.413 --> 06:21.248
Sure.

06:21.282 --> 06:25.052
Let me see. Uh, one second.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.122
- There.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

06:28.155 --> 06:30.024
Uh, can I get you something
to eat?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.358
<i>Quieres comer?</i>

06:31.392 --> 06:35.062
<i>No, gracias. Cigarillo?</i>

06:35.095 --> 06:37.998
Oh, no. No, thank you. No <i>fumo.</i>

06:38.032 --> 06:40.935
Uh, <i>donde estan tus amigos?</i>

06:40.968 --> 06:45.206
Uh, my friends, uh,
they're on the beach. Partying.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.474
Ah.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.977
Hmm. <i>Tiburon.</i>

06:50.978 --> 06:53.113
<i>Gran Tiburon Blanco.</i>

06:57.851 --> 06:59.987
Hey, Nat. Who's your new friend?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.754
- Are you gonna introduce us?
- Uh...

07:01.788 --> 07:05.092
<i>- Tiburon.</i>
- T-tibur... what dude?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.228
I think that's how
he must've lost his legs.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.230
It's a good thing
we're out of here tomorrow.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.331
Tyler!

07:10.364 --> 07:12.866
<i>Escuchame. No estoy mintiendo.</i>

07:12.900 --> 07:14.435
- Whoa. Uh...

07:14.468 --> 07:16.937
<i>- No estoy mintiendo.</i>
- Dude's loco.

07:16.971 --> 07:18.806
-And in serious need of a bath.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.043
<i>Cuidado.</i>

07:23.077 --> 07:26.814
- Hey, dude. Hands to yourself.
<i>- Cuidado. Cuidado.</i>

07:26.847 --> 07:28.449
<i>- Cuidado.</i>
- "Watch out."

07:28.482 --> 07:30.985
<i>- Cuidado.</i>
- He told me to watch out.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.987
It's fine.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.163
Ooh! It's warm!

07:43.197 --> 07:44.498
Ooh! So nice!

07:44.531 --> 07:46.533
- I don't wanna go home.
- Me neither.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.503
Oh, man! I almost slipped
in the water!

07:49.536 --> 07:51.138
What are you guys doing?!

07:51.171 --> 07:53.274
- What are you doing?!
- What the fuck are you doing?

07:53.307 --> 07:55.809
Get the fuck over here!

08:00.347 --> 08:02.816
Hey!

08:02.850 --> 08:05.853
It's our last spring break.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.554
Nat!

08:14.194 --> 08:17.197
<i>Vamos a la playa,</i> homies!

08:24.905 --> 08:28.509
Hey! Let's get this show
back on the road.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.078
<i>Nada mas.</i> I need to sleep.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.212
No, honey. Come
six o'clock this evening,

08:33.246 --> 08:36.183
our asses are on a plane
back to Kansas.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.320
And that's it. <i>Adios.</i>

08:39.352 --> 08:42.890
Plea-ease! When we're back
home, you can sleep for, like,

08:42.923 --> 08:46.193
the next 50 years for all
I care, but... right now,

08:46.226 --> 08:50.230
you're gonna get that cute
little butt of yours into gear.

08:50.264 --> 08:53.133
And we're gonna party!

08:53.167 --> 08:55.102
Okay!

08:55.135 --> 08:57.271
- Whoo!
- Wait up, boom, uh...

09:01.675 --> 09:04.044
Whoo!

09:04.078 --> 09:08.115
- Whoo! Loser!
- Yeah. Douche!

09:11.018 --> 09:12.319
Hey.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.955
Jet skis?

09:22.496 --> 09:24.264
Guys! Look what we found!

09:24.298 --> 09:25.999
Go, go, go!

09:28.469 --> 09:30.571
Come on, get over here!

09:30.604 --> 09:33.507
Ride or die, motherfuckers!

09:33.540 --> 09:35.309
Whoo!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.978
Just break it, man.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.448
This is such a bad idea,
you guys.

09:41.482 --> 09:44.017
We're just borrowing
a couple of jet skis.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.252
Still stealing!

09:45.285 --> 09:47.287
Oh, my God,
keep taking those chill pills.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.655
Spring break!

09:48.689 --> 09:51.925
And our last chance
to do some dumb shit like this.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.927
Well, I-I'm out of here,
you guys.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.498
Oh, my God, you can
take a girl out of Kansas...

09:57.531 --> 09:59.133
You were doing
a good impersonation

09:59.166 --> 10:00.968
of someone who knew
how to enjoy herself.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.004
Hey, Nat.
Something to tell the grandkids!

10:07.508 --> 10:10.043
Alright!

10:15.549 --> 10:16.950
Come on!

10:18.385 --> 10:19.686
- Has he got the keys?
- Yeah.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.664
- He has the keys?
- He got the keys, got the keys.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.357
Are we actually doing this?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.262
This is gonna be
fucking awesome.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.098
Alright, come on!

10:31.131 --> 10:34.168
30 bucks an hour, guys!
Who's paying?

10:34.201 --> 10:37.404
Ha-ha, yes! Gimme them bad boys.

10:37.438 --> 10:38.605
- Okay.
- Hell yeah!

10:38.639 --> 10:40.574
Hey...

10:42.109 --> 10:44.278
- Hey!

10:45.379 --> 10:46.947
Hey, guys. Wait up!

10:48.215 --> 10:50.551

- Whoo!

10:50.584 --> 10:52.553

10:52.586 --> 10:55.088
<i>Vamos!</i>

10:56.056 --> 11:00.294
Whoo!

11:01.695 --> 11:03.063
Where is he?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.698
Tom, you're a douchebag!

11:06.200 --> 11:09.303
- Is he al... Ah, hey!
- Hey! Whoo!

11:09.336 --> 11:10.637
Asshole!

11:10.671 --> 11:12.539
That's it dude,
I'm definitely driving.

11:12.573 --> 11:14.775
Oh, yeah? Keys.

11:14.809 --> 11:17.211
Hey, there's room
for a little one.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.412
Hop on, honey!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.447
Come on,
a quick five minute blast

11:20.481 --> 11:22.316
and then we can get churros
for breakfast!

11:22.349 --> 11:23.750
Churros!

11:23.784 --> 11:25.652
Churros!

11:27.154 --> 11:29.356
- Yes!
- Ahh! Yes!

11:31.425 --> 11:33.193
- Woo!
- Are you on?

11:33.227 --> 11:34.595
Yeah.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.597
- Whoo!
- Do it!

11:43.203 --> 11:44.806
Yeah!

11:44.839 --> 11:46.773
Whoo!

11:56.650 --> 11:59.319
- That's all you got?!
- Losers buy breakfast!

11:59.353 --> 12:01.188
Let me show you, baby!

12:14.836 --> 12:17.304
Yeah!

12:21.308 --> 12:23.110
- Yeah!
- Go on!

12:23.143 --> 12:25.145
- Come on!
- Go on!

12:26.346 --> 12:28.482
We're going too far out!

12:28.515 --> 12:32.152
Greg, I wanna go back to shore!

12:33.821 --> 12:36.223
Greg, please!
Take me back to shore!

12:38.425 --> 12:40.694
Come on! Yeah!

12:41.795 --> 12:43.730
- Where are they going?!
- Jokers!

12:43.764 --> 12:46.433
Go get 'em!

12:46.466 --> 12:49.236
- Okay!
- What are you doing?!

12:49.269 --> 12:50.771
- Slow down!
- Whoa!

12:50.805 --> 12:52.840
Let's go!

12:52.874 --> 12:54.541
Losers!

12:55.843 --> 12:58.145
You wanna play chicken?!
Let's go! Come on!

12:58.178 --> 12:59.746
- Greg, that's enough!
- Whoo-oh!

13:01.214 --> 13:03.317
Yeah, let's go! Woo, woo!

13:06.286 --> 13:07.721
Whoa!

13:10.424 --> 13:12.759
Greg, that's enough.
This is wrong!

13:12.793 --> 13:14.294
That was totally awesome!

13:14.328 --> 13:16.163
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Let's go again!

13:16.196 --> 13:17.564
Please take us back to shore!

13:17.598 --> 13:19.132
Don't be a chicken.
Come on, man!

13:19.166 --> 13:20.400
Yeah, come on!

13:20.434 --> 13:21.768
- Whoo!
- Greg, no.

13:21.803 --> 13:24.137
Who's the chickens here?
Come on!

14:02.776 --> 14:05.345
My leg... My leg!

14:05.379 --> 14:07.547
- Greg?!
- I fucked my fucking leg!

14:09.616 --> 14:10.885
I'm coming!

14:13.654 --> 14:15.890
I'm coming! Greg!

14:19.793 --> 14:22.229
Help, Tom. I can't swim!

14:23.530 --> 14:24.832
Tom!

14:27.835 --> 14:30.203
You alright, Milly?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.472
Milly, you alright?

14:32.506 --> 14:34.441
Okay, stay there, I'm coming.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.714
Don't worry, I got you.
Hold on to me. Okay?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.619
Is it bad?

14:45.652 --> 14:49.222
No, no. Nothing we can't fix.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.693
- What's that smell?
- Gas.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.429
Fuel tank. Must've ruptured.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.598
Tyler?! Where's Tyler?!

14:58.632 --> 15:00.701
Tyler?! Where's Tyler?!

15:02.302 --> 15:03.470
Tyler?!

15:05.739 --> 15:06.974
Tyler?!

15:14.314 --> 15:15.983
Fuck!

15:18.019 --> 15:19.386
Dude!

15:20.387 --> 15:22.622
Dude, dude. Come on. Dude!

15:29.396 --> 15:31.966
Come on.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.902
No, Greg, Greg, Greg,
Greg, Greg. No, please.

15:34.936 --> 15:37.771
Okay, hold on.

15:37.805 --> 15:39.573
- You need to talk to him!
- What?!

15:39.606 --> 15:41.943
In case he has a head injury.
Ask him some questions!

15:41.976 --> 15:44.311
- Dude, what's your name?
- Huh?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.513
Your name, dude! Your name!

15:46.546 --> 15:48.749
It's Tyler, you dumb shit.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.618
- How long you known me for?
- He's good.

16:04.065 --> 16:06.800
Okay, dude. Come here.

16:06.834 --> 16:09.804
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
One, two, three.

16:09.837 --> 16:13.306
Alright, one, two, three...

16:21.548 --> 16:22.884
Here!

16:26.954 --> 16:29.389
Oh, God!

16:31.458 --> 16:32.793
My cell!

16:32.827 --> 16:35.029
You gotta keep still
or you're gonna tip us over.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.035
You okay, bro?

16:42.837 --> 16:44.538
It's working!

16:44.571 --> 16:47.008
Oh, fuck. No signal.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.876
- Fuck, fuck!
- Here, let me.

16:56.050 --> 16:58.518
Son of a bitch, come on!

16:59.854 --> 17:01.588
It's okay.

17:03.057 --> 17:05.059
We'll be okay.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.361
Hang on.

17:51.939 --> 17:53.607
Oh, no, no. No, no.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.810
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, no, no, no, no...

18:00.848 --> 18:02.716
We need to get him to hospital.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.552
You think you could take us
back to shore? Nice and steady?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.055
What? Yeah, uh,
but how are we all gonna fit on?

18:08.089 --> 18:09.957
There's only room
for three of us.

18:11.625 --> 18:14.061
Let's get Greg to the hospital.

18:14.095 --> 18:17.164
No. No, no, wait, hold on.
I can't swim properly!

18:17.198 --> 18:19.066
- We'll come right back for you.
- What?!

18:19.100 --> 18:21.002
The sea's calm
and the water's warm.

18:21.035 --> 18:23.703
No. No, no, no way, sorry!

18:23.737 --> 18:26.573
You can hold on to the other
jet ski if you have to.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.975
We gotta get him back to shore.

18:28.009 --> 18:30.011
Please. Please, I don't...
I don't wanna die.

18:30.044 --> 18:33.214
Milly, Milly. We're good
right here. Okay? Right here.

18:33.247 --> 18:35.850
Look.
Hold on to me if you have to.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.154
- Alright?
- We need to do this. Right now.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.026
Okay.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.627
Okay.

18:47.661 --> 18:49.964
Hey, breathe. Breathe.

18:59.673 --> 19:02.043
- Hold on to me, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

19:02.076 --> 19:04.744
- I got you.
- Alright. Okay.

19:08.249 --> 19:09.716
You two cool?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.551
It's a nice day for a swim, bro.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.988
- Nat?
- Yeah, I got him.

19:16.290 --> 19:18.792
Okay, yeah. Alright. Yeah.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.499
- Shit!
- What?!

19:26.533 --> 19:27.902
- God damn!
- Well, what is it?

19:27.935 --> 19:29.502
It's dead!

19:31.939 --> 19:35.042
- Motherfucker!
- Can you fix it?

19:35.076 --> 19:37.744
I major in history. Tyler,
you know anything about engines?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.746
I don't even know
where the engine is.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.514
I can feel something.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.260
- I... I think it's a clasp.
- Good work, dude.

19:43.284 --> 19:46.153
We need to move him
so we can get under the seat.

19:46.187 --> 19:49.556
We're gonna move you, okay?
Guys, we need help.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.690
Come on.

19:51.993 --> 19:54.895
- Okay, go.
- W-w-w-wait!

19:57.231 --> 19:58.933
- Hold on to me, alright?
- Yeah.

19:58.966 --> 20:00.800
- You gotta hold on.
- You got him?

20:00.835 --> 20:02.669
- Hold on to us.
- Easy.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.972
Slow. Slow, Greg. Slow. Slow.

20:08.075 --> 20:10.878
It's okay, it's okay, dude.

20:10.911 --> 20:12.847
It's okay, dude.
We got you. We got you.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.049
Let's do this. Quickly.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.096
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.835
Can you see anything?

20:34.869 --> 20:36.603
I don't know. Hang on.

20:39.106 --> 20:40.875
How am I supposed
to get this thing off?

20:40.908 --> 20:43.344
Uh... uh, is there a toolbox?

20:43.377 --> 20:45.712
No. Fuck!

20:45.745 --> 20:47.281
Alright, try starting it again.

20:52.353 --> 20:54.055
We need to get him back up.

20:58.192 --> 20:59.726
Pull me up!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.829
Three, two, one...

21:45.840 --> 21:47.141
<i>Animales.</i>

22:09.263 --> 22:11.265
It's, like,
seven in the morning.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.101
No one's out and about.

22:15.136 --> 22:17.404
You got any other bright ideas?

22:17.438 --> 22:19.273
I was just saying.

22:19.306 --> 22:20.841
Well, don't.

22:20.875 --> 22:23.210
Cos every time I listen to you,
I end up in trouble.

22:30.050 --> 22:32.119
We're drifting out.

22:32.153 --> 22:33.888
What?

22:33.921 --> 22:37.324
There was a church tower on the
left and I can't see it anymore.

22:37.358 --> 22:39.093
The tide must've changed.

22:40.327 --> 22:43.097
We have to get signal
on Milly's cell.

22:43.130 --> 22:45.399
- Tom?
- Shh, dude, someone's coming.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.667
No... I'm so thirsty.

22:49.403 --> 22:51.138
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

22:51.172 --> 22:53.740
Greg, you can't drink the water.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.309
- Please. Please.
- Dude, I'm sorry.

22:55.342 --> 22:56.977
Okay.

22:57.011 --> 22:59.813
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.748
- Okay.
- I'll get us out of here.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.018
Okay. Okay.

23:04.051 --> 23:06.387
"Can't stop thinking
about last night."

23:07.521 --> 23:09.089
What?

23:09.123 --> 23:10.858
"So hot."

23:15.429 --> 23:17.464
Give me the phone.

23:17.498 --> 23:19.266
No!

23:20.401 --> 23:21.869
What are you doing?!

23:21.902 --> 23:23.413
- What am I doing?!
- Give me the God damn phone!

23:23.437 --> 23:24.939
- No!
- Give me the God damn phone!

23:24.972 --> 23:26.440
- No! I...
- Shit!

23:26.473 --> 23:29.310
- Look what you've done!
- What I've done?!

23:29.343 --> 23:31.312
- Yes, you!
- I trusted you!

23:31.345 --> 23:33.480
- Nat, I was drunk!
- Cheaters!

23:38.485 --> 23:40.854
- Asshole!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:40.888 --> 23:43.290
You are such an asshole.

23:43.324 --> 23:45.826
- Nat, I am sorry.
- Fuck you.

24:14.822 --> 24:16.991
He's never gonna get it.

24:44.618 --> 24:46.353
God, where is he?

24:52.626 --> 24:55.996
- No! Whoa, whoa!
- What was that?

24:56.030 --> 24:57.564
- Milly?!
- Shit.

25:01.235 --> 25:02.303
Sorry.

25:02.336 --> 25:04.905
You dragged me under!
You asshole!

25:07.875 --> 25:10.277
Didn't think
I was gonna make it.

25:10.311 --> 25:12.313
Here's the cell.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.591
Asshole.

26:23.450 --> 26:25.586
Natty, I'm so, so, so sorry.

26:27.354 --> 26:28.956
I was so drunk.

26:30.224 --> 26:31.358
So was he.

26:33.193 --> 26:35.963
He said you two weren't
getting on and that's why...

26:40.634 --> 26:42.202
That's why he what?

26:44.471 --> 26:46.640
I may not be the only one.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.442
Did anyone notice
that dude in the boat?

26:48.475 --> 26:51.111
- What?
- We passed him on the way out.

26:51.145 --> 26:54.014
He was on some kind of sailboat.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.049
I don't think he was moving
very fast,

26:56.083 --> 26:58.652
so he might still be out there
between us and the shore.

26:58.685 --> 27:01.989
So why can't we see him?

27:02.022 --> 27:04.658
I don't know. But I think
I'm gonna take my chance.

27:04.691 --> 27:07.094
We have to stick together
till someone comes.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.163
And what if no-one comes?

27:13.367 --> 27:16.670
Look, I can ace this.
I can do this.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.572
Tyler, no.
You took a bang to the head.

27:18.605 --> 27:22.075
That might be a problem if there
was something inside of there.

27:22.109 --> 27:25.212
You don't have to do this.

27:25.245 --> 27:28.048
- Please.
- I reckon I do.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.417
Thank you.

27:31.318 --> 27:32.653
Here.

27:32.686 --> 27:35.756
I got it when I was 14
at the Platte County Fair

27:35.789 --> 27:37.491
from the guy running
the bumper cars.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.461
That all he gave you?

27:40.494 --> 27:42.095
That's so cool.

27:45.399 --> 27:46.600
Bro.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.070
Kick ass.

27:51.238 --> 27:53.240
Dude.

27:53.273 --> 27:54.675
You got this.

27:59.646 --> 28:01.448
Good luck, Tyler.

28:02.583 --> 28:05.319
Y'all just hang tight now,
alright?

28:07.721 --> 28:09.156
No partying when I'm gone.

28:13.093 --> 28:14.795
- Go, Tyler!
- Whoo!

28:14.829 --> 28:16.797
- Go on, Tyler!
- Go, Tyler!

28:16.831 --> 28:19.700
- Go, Ty!
- Go, Tyler!

28:19.733 --> 28:21.568
Whoo-ooh!

28:26.173 --> 28:27.307
Shit.

28:27.341 --> 28:29.776
Don't worry, he's gonna make it.

28:29.811 --> 28:31.478
He's got this.

28:31.512 --> 28:33.313
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

29:22.696 --> 29:24.164
Fuck.

29:25.465 --> 29:27.434
Shark. Shark!

29:27.467 --> 29:29.102
What?

29:29.136 --> 29:31.438
Tyler! Shark!

29:34.374 --> 29:36.076
- Tyler!
- Tyler!

29:40.647 --> 29:42.683
Get out of the water, shark!

29:51.558 --> 29:53.861
- Where did it go?
- Uh...

30:02.402 --> 30:03.770
You sure it was a shark?

30:03.805 --> 30:06.740
Shit, I don't know! What does
a shark even look like?!

30:10.177 --> 30:11.211
Let me up!

30:34.869 --> 30:36.570
Greg! Greg!

30:38.538 --> 30:41.508
- I can't swim! Ah!
- Milly!

30:41.541 --> 30:43.543
We need to get out the water!

30:46.580 --> 30:47.614
Milly!

30:51.919 --> 30:54.721
- I'm coming! Milly!
- Greg!

30:59.493 --> 31:02.262
I felt something on my leg!

31:07.267 --> 31:08.402
Milly! Come on!

31:08.435 --> 31:09.904
Come on.

31:23.851 --> 31:26.821
We need help! Somebody help!
Tom!

31:26.854 --> 31:28.823
Somebody help me!

31:37.397 --> 31:38.933
Tom!

31:38.966 --> 31:40.634
We need help!

31:42.436 --> 31:44.872
Nat, stay there. I'm coming.

31:48.308 --> 31:50.912
Please, God.

31:55.782 --> 31:56.984
Nat!

32:01.655 --> 32:04.424
It's dragging both of you!
You have to let go!

32:07.895 --> 32:09.229
Nat!

32:13.734 --> 32:15.335
Nat!

33:01.548 --> 33:03.918
- Nat!
- Oh, my God!

33:05.652 --> 33:07.521
Oh, my God, come on, come on!

33:09.489 --> 33:11.358
- Keep going, keep going!
- Keep swimming!

33:11.391 --> 33:14.628
Come on, come on!
You can do it, you can do it!

33:17.098 --> 33:18.398
Come on!

33:19.000 --> 33:20.667
Grab my hand.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.569
- Tom, help her.
- I got her.

33:25.372 --> 33:27.707
I thought we lost you.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.713
You're safe now, okay?

33:33.747 --> 33:35.049
You're safe now.

33:36.017 --> 33:38.085
Just breathe.

33:38.119 --> 33:40.320
Nice and slow.

33:42.722 --> 33:44.457
It's okay, Nat.

33:46.861 --> 33:48.528
It's okay.

34:41.181 --> 34:42.850
Is there any way that...

34:47.554 --> 34:50.091
Greg, he maybe...

35:17.584 --> 35:20.420
<i>Gran tiburon blanco.</i>

35:27.261 --> 35:29.130
What?

35:31.598 --> 35:35.669
The beggar... in the town.

35:38.906 --> 35:41.775
He told me he had lost his legs
in a shark attack.

35:49.749 --> 35:51.685
He said it was a great white.

36:42.303 --> 36:44.238
Anything?

36:44.271 --> 36:45.906
No.

36:53.247 --> 36:55.816
What if no-one comes?

36:59.120 --> 37:01.188
What if Tyler
can't find the boat?

37:01.222 --> 37:03.124
Milly, shut up!

37:04.624 --> 37:07.594
The shark gets him
and then comes back for us.

37:07.627 --> 37:09.296
Milly, shut the fuck up!

37:17.204 --> 37:19.773
I'm such an asshole,
you're right.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.213
How many others were there?

37:29.283 --> 37:31.651
How many besides Milly?

37:40.861 --> 37:42.029
Two.

37:42.997 --> 37:44.331
I'm sorry.

37:54.375 --> 37:58.212
My mom and dad got you down
as a stand-up guy.

37:59.180 --> 38:02.016
Real son-in-law material.

38:02.049 --> 38:05.186
And Billy, he hero worships you.

38:08.022 --> 38:10.891
I mean, why are you even
still with me?

38:15.396 --> 38:16.729
Huh?

38:18.765 --> 38:20.201
Cos I love you.

38:20.234 --> 38:23.070
Tom, the only person you love
is yourself.

38:24.805 --> 38:27.041
Okay. So, maybe you should start

38:27.074 --> 38:29.243
trying to show yourself
some love.

38:29.276 --> 38:32.079
And stop doing shit for people
and trying to please everyone.

38:32.113 --> 38:33.746
It's called showing respect.

38:33.780 --> 38:34.949
It's called being a doormat

38:34.982 --> 38:36.984
and that's why people
walk all over you.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.343
Hey!

39:02.376 --> 39:04.078
Hey! Over here!

39:08.015 --> 39:10.351
Hey! Right here!

39:17.391 --> 39:18.691
Hey!

39:18.725 --> 39:19.960
Hey!

40:29.530 --> 40:31.198
No! No!

40:31.232 --> 40:34.268
No, no. No...

40:51.518 --> 40:54.455
Help! Shark! Help!

41:26.520 --> 41:28.222
What time is it?

41:30.891 --> 41:32.926
Nat? Time.

41:38.098 --> 41:40.534
It's 3:15.

41:40.567 --> 41:43.037
How long we been out here?

41:45.873 --> 41:48.375
Tyler must've found the boat
by now.

41:52.212 --> 41:55.549
Someone's gotta be
missing us? Right?

41:56.583 --> 41:58.152
Someone cares?

42:08.595 --> 42:10.397
I just wanna go home.

42:20.641 --> 42:22.876
I hope you can forgive me.

42:45.265 --> 42:47.101
I think I've found something.

43:00.647 --> 43:02.583
I don't know
what I'm looking at.

43:10.591 --> 43:12.025
Don't.

43:13.560 --> 43:17.931
If you wanna feel even more
dehydrated, be my guest.

43:27.074 --> 43:28.409
Try, uh...

43:30.010 --> 43:31.578
Try licking your lips.

44:23.297 --> 44:27.267
It's 6:30. It'll be dark soon.

44:29.269 --> 44:31.472
Least we'll be out of the sun.

44:34.041 --> 44:36.109
We were supposed
to be home by now.

44:40.481 --> 44:45.118
The airline, they'll
know we're missing, right?

44:51.291 --> 44:53.527
I don't wanna be
out here in the dark.

45:21.455 --> 45:23.223
So cold.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.562
What the fuck was that?

45:30.264 --> 45:31.765
I don't know.

45:36.236 --> 45:38.806
Do sharks hunt at night?

45:38.840 --> 45:43.477
I guess... it depends
if they're hungry or not.

45:43.510 --> 45:45.312
This thing's fucking with us.

46:02.629 --> 46:03.764
There's a light.

46:05.465 --> 46:06.700
Guys!

46:07.601 --> 46:08.802
Is that a boat?!

46:10.203 --> 46:12.874
Guys, there's a light.
Over there!

46:12.907 --> 46:14.842
- Hello?!
- Hey!

46:14.876 --> 46:16.677
Somebody?! Hey!

46:16.710 --> 46:18.745
- Hey, over here!
- We're over here!

46:18.779 --> 46:20.858
- What is it? What is it?
- That is a boat over there.

46:20.882 --> 46:22.316
- Hey! Dude!
- We're stuck!

46:22.349 --> 46:24.251
- Hey!
- Over here!

46:24.284 --> 46:27.487
- Over here!
- I don't think they can hear us.

46:27.521 --> 46:29.556
Use the torch! The torch
on your cell phone

46:29.590 --> 46:31.358
so they can see us in the dark!

46:31.391 --> 46:33.126
Somebody, help. Please!

46:33.160 --> 46:35.529
Hey, hey! Over here!

46:37.331 --> 46:38.565
What are they doing?

46:38.599 --> 46:40.367
Give me the phone.

46:41.234 --> 46:42.569
Hello?!

46:43.938 --> 46:45.339
- Hey!
- Hey!

46:45.372 --> 46:46.773
- This way!
- Help!

46:46.808 --> 46:50.243
- What are they waiting for?
- Don't know.

46:50.277 --> 46:51.813
How far is it?

46:51.846 --> 46:53.780
50, maybe 60 yards.

46:53.815 --> 46:55.382
You think you can swim it?

46:58.752 --> 47:00.354
What?

47:00.387 --> 47:02.656
One of us is gonna have
to swim over to the boat.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.829
You can do this.

48:40.287 --> 48:41.989
I can't, I can't.

48:42.023 --> 48:43.858
I can't. I'm sorry.

48:50.564 --> 48:51.866
Sorry.

49:04.846 --> 49:05.980
I'm sorry.

49:11.986 --> 49:13.320
Nat?

49:14.554 --> 49:15.923
You don't have to.

49:17.324 --> 49:18.759
Nat.

49:21.829 --> 49:25.867
You see anything...
move in the water...

49:28.735 --> 49:30.270
you holler.

51:17.912 --> 51:20.047
Are you okay?

51:21.983 --> 51:23.818
What happened here?

51:42.103 --> 51:43.436
- Nat!
- Nat!

51:43.470 --> 51:44.704
- Nat!
- Hey!

51:44.738 --> 51:46.140
We have to do something!

51:46.173 --> 51:49.010
Do something!

51:56.884 --> 51:58.718
Oh, fuck.

52:09.163 --> 52:10.998
It's only me!

52:11.032 --> 52:12.766
It's only me, it's only me.

52:12.799 --> 52:15.502
It's only me. Come on. Got you.

52:18.738 --> 52:20.041
I got you.

52:23.110 --> 52:25.679
We're almost there.
Nearly there.

52:31.052 --> 52:32.519
It's okay.

52:36.790 --> 52:38.960
- Milly, come on, help.
- Give me your hand, here.

52:42.196 --> 52:43.831
Did it bite you?

52:48.535 --> 52:49.636
There was...

52:52.605 --> 52:54.809
- Tell me.
- There was a man...

52:56.077 --> 52:57.812
in the water in a life vest.

52:57.845 --> 53:00.580
He must've been a sailor.

53:00.613 --> 53:02.950
I think the shark
must've wrecked his boat

53:02.984 --> 53:04.218
and killed him.

54:53.094 --> 54:55.229
Oh, what is it?!

54:56.831 --> 54:58.165
Oh, geez.

55:03.170 --> 55:05.039
Holy fuck.

55:16.683 --> 55:21.155
If we sit here and do nothing,
we're shark bait.

55:21.188 --> 55:24.125
If we don't die of dehydration
first.

55:30.264 --> 55:33.766
There's some driftwood.
You think we can reach it?

55:45.913 --> 55:47.714
Got it! Got it.

55:49.116 --> 55:50.683
For you.

55:50.717 --> 55:52.419
There's a life vest.

55:52.453 --> 55:56.157
What if I fall in the water?
I can only do the doggy paddle.

56:32.927 --> 56:34.128
Okay.

56:36.230 --> 56:39.033
Now hold it right there.

56:39.066 --> 56:40.434
Holy shit.

56:41.869 --> 56:43.736
Who's doing this?

57:19.240 --> 57:22.109
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

57:25.546 --> 57:27.248
Thanks.

58:10.124 --> 58:12.226
Are you sure it's this way?

58:12.259 --> 58:15.329
Uh, I can't tell.

58:51.365 --> 58:53.400
Come on, back there.

58:53.434 --> 58:55.235
I'm exhausted.

58:57.371 --> 58:58.872
God, I'm sorry.

58:58.906 --> 59:02.276
Sorry's... not good enough.

59:02.309 --> 59:04.144
Screw you, Nat.

59:05.112 --> 59:08.115
Screw... you, Milly!

59:15.222 --> 59:16.357
Where did it go?

59:30.237 --> 59:32.272
Oh, shit!

59:40.981 --> 59:42.449
Oh, God.

59:47.388 --> 59:50.657
Nat got the motherfucker
real bad. Like, real bad.

59:50.691 --> 59:52.559
So why would it even bother
coming back?

59:52.593 --> 59:55.162
Cos now it's pissed
as well as hungry.

59:58.098 --> 59:59.566
We gotta get this thing started.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.169
We all get up, real slow.

01:00:02.202 --> 01:00:03.537
We already did that.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.539
There's no way I'm going into
the God damn water.

01:00:05.572 --> 01:00:08.342
We have to try.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:10.377
How are we gonna do this?

01:00:13.614 --> 01:00:16.450
You go the left,
I'll go to the right.

01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:18.085
Hold on to each other,

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:19.987
keep ourselves
from falling into the sea.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.489
Whoa, whoa! We have to go
at the same time. Okay?

01:00:22.523 --> 01:00:24.391
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:27.628
On the count of three.

01:00:28.495 --> 01:00:30.097
One...

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.633
two, three.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.276
I got you. I got you.

01:00:46.613 --> 01:00:49.650
- Natty!
- You're good. You're good.

01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:53.153
Tom, you got this?

01:01:13.774 --> 01:01:16.043
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:01:16.076 --> 01:01:17.578
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:24.051
Yeah.

01:01:25.252 --> 01:01:26.687
Further.

01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:34.495
Now what?

01:01:34.528 --> 01:01:37.397
We need to get that casing off
so we can get into the engine.

01:01:47.508 --> 01:01:50.544
If I can get something
under it, I can work it loose.

01:01:51.745 --> 01:01:54.248
We need to break it.

01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:58.085
I'm in the wrong position.
Milly, you try.

01:01:58.118 --> 01:02:00.320
Nat, grab the other side
and we'll pull together.

01:02:00.354 --> 01:02:01.722
Oh, fuck.

01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:04.091
Come on. Milly?

01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:09.029
Nobody move.

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:12.466
Why?

01:02:19.206 --> 01:02:20.641
What's it doing?

01:02:21.575 --> 01:02:23.110
Circling us.

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:31.251
It's getting closer.

01:02:32.519 --> 01:02:34.288
We have to get
the seat back down.

01:03:16.864 --> 01:03:19.466
Milly! Milly!

01:03:19.499 --> 01:03:21.635
Tom!

01:03:21.668 --> 01:03:23.838
- Tom!
- Nat!

01:03:34.548 --> 01:03:36.818
Tom!

01:03:36.851 --> 01:03:38.285
Milly!

01:03:39.887 --> 01:03:41.588
Help! No!

01:03:41.622 --> 01:03:43.690
Fuck!

01:03:45.559 --> 01:03:46.760
Milly!

01:03:48.729 --> 01:03:51.465
Tom, I have to get you
to help me, okay?

01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:52.799
Hold on!

01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:54.668
Hold on!

01:03:58.472 --> 01:03:59.706
Tom!

01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:02.643
Milly!

01:04:02.676 --> 01:04:04.444
Milly!

01:04:05.479 --> 01:04:06.814
Milly!

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.290
Milly!

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.863
Come on, Milly!

01:04:21.896 --> 01:04:23.196
Milly!

01:04:28.002 --> 01:04:29.569
Come on!

01:04:29.603 --> 01:04:31.338
I've got you!

01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:35.242
I've got you.

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:38.578
I got you.

01:04:38.612 --> 01:04:40.280
Hold on. Hold on.

01:04:42.016 --> 01:04:43.951
Milly!

01:06:24.986 --> 01:06:26.686
I'm a Kansas girl.

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.491
Go Kansas.

01:06:33.928 --> 01:06:35.963
Kansas girls go down fighting.

01:06:39.733 --> 01:06:41.002
Tom?

01:06:42.736 --> 01:06:43.938
Tom?

01:06:46.439 --> 01:06:47.674
Tom?

01:06:51.979 --> 01:06:53.747
Stay with me, okay?

01:07:17.404 --> 01:07:18.572
Tom?

01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:24.344
Tom, uh, best linebacker?

01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:26.580
Huh?

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.749
Come on, Tom. Talk to me, Tom.
Best Chiefs linebacker?

01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:34.956
Tom?!

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:36.991
Bobby Bell.

01:07:37.024 --> 01:07:40.560
Bell sucks.
Derrick Thomas all day!

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:48.970
Uh, best quarterback?

01:07:52.139 --> 01:07:54.141
Come on, Tom. Best quarterback?

01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:01.548
Shit.

01:08:01.581 --> 01:08:03.717
I can't hear you, Tom.
Keep talking.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.053
I'm thirsty.

01:08:06.087 --> 01:08:07.855
We'll be back in San Jose

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:10.024
drinking a cold cerveza
in no time.

01:08:35.015 --> 01:08:36.582
You can do this.

01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:21.560
Nat!

01:09:21.594 --> 01:09:24.031
Nat! Nat!

01:09:36.776 --> 01:09:39.779
Nat. Nat...

01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:04.071
Nat. Nat!

01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:06.173
It's coming back!

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.709
It's coming back!

01:10:14.882 --> 01:10:16.783
It's coming back!

01:10:16.817 --> 01:10:18.551
Nat!

01:10:23.057 --> 01:10:25.126
Nat...

01:10:33.067 --> 01:10:34.567
Nat?

01:11:27.388 --> 01:11:29.957
I thought you were dead.

01:11:41.368 --> 01:11:43.904
Still need to get the seat up.

01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:54.808
Hold me. Not too tight.

01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:12.159
Please, God.

01:13:25.172 --> 01:13:26.773
Hang on, Tom.

01:14:08.382 --> 01:14:12.186
Tom, I can see the shore!
We're almost there!

01:14:20.427 --> 01:14:22.162
We're gonna make it!

01:14:35.309 --> 01:14:36.443
Hold on!

01:14:45.419 --> 01:14:48.022
Shit! We're taking in water.

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:55.529
I don't know if we have
the power to outrun it

01:14:55.562 --> 01:14:57.131
and make it to shore.

01:14:57.865 --> 01:14:59.333
Come on!

01:15:03.237 --> 01:15:06.206
Tom, we're sinking.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.175
We're too heavy.

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:09.843
Can you see it?

01:15:09.877 --> 01:15:12.246
Is it still following us?

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.986
Tell your folks and Billy

01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:20.254
I really was a stand-up guy.

01:15:20.287 --> 01:15:22.056
God!

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:27.995
- I love you.
- Tom!

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:32.232
Tom? Tom! No! Wait!

01:15:35.502 --> 01:15:37.905
- Get out of here.
- Hold on!

01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:42.176
Shark. Shark!

01:15:45.446 --> 01:15:47.381
Tom, no!

01:15:47.414 --> 01:15:49.316
Come on. Please!

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.251
I can't do this alone.

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:52.953
Just go.

01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:57.358
You can still make it. Come on!

01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:02.162
Come on, Tom. Please.

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:05.065
I'm sorry.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.001
Tom!

01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:11.238
No!

01:17:48.702 --> 01:17:50.304
Shit.

01:21:41.368 --> 01:21:43.503
