WEBVTT

00:35.493 --> 00:36.453
What?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.414
That color looks good on you.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.112
Hi.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.364
Hey.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.534
Did you need something?

02:41.327 --> 02:42.245
No.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.707
Okay.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.709
I was thinking…

02:48.877 --> 02:52.088
maybe we could grab dinner tonight?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.180
There's this place on 9th Avenue.

03:01.472 --> 03:02.473
Yeah.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.019
Never mind. I'll let you get back to work.

03:06.102 --> 03:09.355
Does the lady prefer red or white flowers
for her corsage?

03:12.275 --> 03:13.985
-What?
-For our first date.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.362
This is a date, right?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.324
Right?

03:20.408 --> 03:21.492
Don't push it.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.163
I'll text you the address.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.790
Wait, so it's red or white?

03:28.374 --> 03:30.376
I think it's red. It's red.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.027
There.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.155
That's better.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.596
Three days, maybe four.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.098
If you don't get lost.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.267
Which you will.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.895
Here I come lights.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.564
Whatever you are.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.153
Holy shit.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.325
Hello.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.334
Hello.

05:47.930 --> 05:48.931
No.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.065
Fuck!

05:59.275 --> 06:00.276
Shit.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.488
Straight lines are hard out here.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.992
You know, could be worse.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.161
Yeah, how?

06:12.789 --> 06:13.956
You could be dead.

06:49.033 --> 06:53.162
-Mom.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.706
Mom.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.296
-Mom!
-What is it, sunflower?

07:02.380 --> 07:03.631
I'm working.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.384
Where's Dad? I have Girl Scouts.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.678
In a faculty meeting.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.305
So, now I get to take you.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.777
Why did you do that?

07:25.486 --> 07:28.406
Houses… are prisons.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.909
-We have to take two subways.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.790
-Mom.
-We're not taking the subway.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.375
We're taking the car, sí?

07:40.376 --> 07:42.753
We have all the time in the world.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.672
Does Dad know you're driving?

07:48.009 --> 07:51.596
Your father needs to stop trying
to control everything we do.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.426
Open your eyes!

08:32.887 --> 08:34.680
Move! Ah!

08:34.764 --> 08:36.015
Where's the funeral?

08:39.769 --> 08:41.771
What an idiot!

08:42.772 --> 08:44.273
You're passing it! Stop!

08:52.949 --> 08:54.784
I should be a stunt driver, right?

08:55.993 --> 08:57.119
It ends at00.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.915
Don't eat too much,
summer solstice is here.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.627
Your father says I put too much turmeric
in the stew.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.213
I'll buy him the bread
with the seeds he likes, he needs cumin.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.174
Oh, should I make popcorn for the movie?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.261
Too much melted butter
makes the crunch go away.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.556
Are you okay?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.016
Mighty fine.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.394
- 00 or- 00?

09:21.978 --> 09:23.104
What?

09:23.187 --> 09:25.147
-Fuck! Go!

09:25.231 --> 09:26.774
She wants to pull out.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.651
- 00 or fucking- 00, Liv?

09:39.161 --> 09:41.789
You don't want to go
to the movies tonight?

09:45.501 --> 09:46.836
00 is good.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.732
It's one thing to travel
in a straight line,

10:07.815 --> 10:11.152
when you have a fixed point
you can keep your eye on.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.987
Today we're gonna learn how to make…

10:14.030 --> 10:14.947
a compass.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.868
If you're ever lost,
this is how you find your way home.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.203
Your North.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.915
Okay, put it through the cork

10:25.958 --> 10:28.336
and then we're gonna drop it
into the water.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.299
Who wants to try next?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.978
What's wrong?
You forget your cork collection?

10:46.062 --> 10:47.229
Yes.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.398
Today's just not your day.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.303
Fuck.

11:19.887 --> 11:24.684
Okay, first we're gonna magnetize
the needle just like this.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.478
Then we're gonna put it through the cork.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.356
Magnet.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.316
Fucking magnet.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.280
Fuck.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.200
Shit.

11:46.622 --> 11:50.459
Okay. Okay, there's got to be one. Fu--

12:31.167 --> 12:32.918
That should be enough.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.101
Fuck, yeah.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.395
Fuck, yeah.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.493
Ow! Ah, fuck!

15:49.782 --> 15:50.866
Perfect.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.458
The usual, hon?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.962
Uh, not yet,
I'm actually waiting on someone.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.422
Not just you and your laptop tonight?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.174
Who's the lucky fella?

16:08.258 --> 16:09.843
Oh, just some guy from work.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.721
-Hey!

16:13.722 --> 16:14.932
Easy.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.560
I am going to dance on the bar
the day that thing dies.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.814
You know what?

16:23.107 --> 16:24.274
I will have something.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.735
My usual.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.590
What are you going to play?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.216
Hey.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.261
You came.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.929
Yeah. Um, am I late?

17:36.013 --> 17:38.807
-I thought you said00.
-No, no, no, no. I'm just always early.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.434
Come on. I'm at the bar. Come on.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.357
They serve food in here?

17:47.441 --> 17:48.650
Uh…

17:48.734 --> 17:50.277
Do peanuts qualify?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.613
They're accompanied
by my favorite bourbon.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.742
-What are we drinking, kids?
-Mm, same for me.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.954
-A club soda, thanks.
-What? No.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.708
Come on, one drink.
This is my happy place.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.669
This is your happy place?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.588
Mm-hm, it's where I come to forget.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.258
One drink.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.393
When did you… when did you
know you wanted to be a lawyer?

18:24.311 --> 18:25.270
Sixth grade.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.772
Mm-hm.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.441
I conducted an investigation

18:29.525 --> 18:32.986
in my homeroom
because someone stole my pencil case.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.449
Yeah, the trial was held during recess.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.076
You?

18:39.660 --> 18:42.496
Well, I'm still not sure
I do want to be a lawyer.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.166
You know, I studied philosophy in college.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.545
-Of course, you did.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.506
-I thought I was gonna teach.
-Oh, yeah? What happened?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.843
Uh… my mom died.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.891
-I'm sorry.
-But it's okay, I kind of checked out.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.852
Backpacked through Europe for a while.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.439
And when the money ran out,
I decided to go to law school.

19:10.274 --> 19:14.486
Dance with the devil a few years,
then cash out while I still have a soul.

19:14.987 --> 19:19.449
Go do something meaningful or meaningless.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.370
Buy an RV, see the world.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.542
Plant a garden with flowers, have goats.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.671
You know, like, regular life.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.132
What?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.927
Please tell me you have never been
to Burning Man.

19:39.011 --> 19:43.682
No, but I do consider myself
Burning Man adjacent.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.767
Okay, can I get the check, please?

19:45.851 --> 19:48.687
-I'm very much Burning Man-curious.
-I'm done.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.148
-What, you don't want to go with me?
-No, thank you.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.941
Seems like a great place to forget.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.861
Oh, trust me, I've got that covered.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.203
Thanks for showing me your happy place.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.986
Hi, you've reached Liv Rivera.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.531
I can't return your call right now.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.577
My phone is dead
and I'm stranded in the forest.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.041
Please contact Danny Summerfield

20:51.875 --> 20:54.253
and tell him to stay the fuck out
of my snack drawer.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.299
And that I'm sorry.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.053
Thank you.

21:08.058 --> 21:08.892
Hi.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.812
It's me, Liv.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.815
Your daughter. Remember?

21:23.490 --> 21:24.825
Where were you?

21:25.450 --> 21:31.123
The adventurer returns
bearing gifts from her travels!

21:35.210 --> 21:36.545
Guess what I found at the store--

21:36.628 --> 21:37.921
What if something happened to her?

21:38.005 --> 21:39.923
I have a sickness.
I didn't choose to be this way.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.926
But I won't make myself disappear.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.429
Look how much I've been painting.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.557
Look at all those people
who came to my show.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.225
Use your head. You're a mother.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.353
That's not all I am.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.648
I am a painter. I am a person!

21:57.482 --> 21:59.818
Also, Dad died.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.780
Not sure if you care about that but…

22:06.408 --> 22:07.367
Now I'm here…

22:08.827 --> 22:10.037
walking in the woods.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.374
I almost died in a plane crash.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.379
What else?

22:21.214 --> 22:22.549
Well, I'm pregnant.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.093
Any motherly advice?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.764
Other than always put yourself first?

22:30.098 --> 22:32.351
And… and don't tell me to have fun.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.478
Fuck fun.

22:37.230 --> 22:41.360
I'm where fun goes to die.
That's on you, by the way.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.658
I think I'm lost.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.247
Is this how you felt
before you left?

23:01.421 --> 23:03.090
Never mind, it doesn't matter.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.091
No!

23:53.640 --> 23:55.559
Oh, no, no, no…

23:55.642 --> 23:57.060
Uh-oh!

23:57.144 --> 23:59.479
Looks like your magnet wore off.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.773
You forget something?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.532
-Shouldn't you think this through?
-I have.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.534
I'm going back to the lake
to get the watch.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.370
And what makes you think
you can find your way back

24:15.454 --> 24:17.080
better than you can find your way forward?

24:17.164 --> 24:18.540
I can do it better than you.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.667
Oh, yeah? How's that?

24:20.750 --> 24:22.544
For one thing, you're dead.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.547
Yeah, but I'm also you.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.425
I can find my way home.
I've done it before.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.351
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-Shut up.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.314
You should have just let him drag me
into the woods.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.150
He was only trying to survive.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.527
-And I was already dead.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.739
Did you really think
you were going to find her?

24:52.324 --> 24:55.702
Or is this whole thing
just you throwing another match

24:55.785 --> 24:58.163
into the gas can you call your life?

24:59.039 --> 25:00.499
I am all that you have got.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.043
-You need me.
-For what?

25:03.835 --> 25:06.713
To tell me how everything I'm doing wrong
and how everything's gonna go to shit,

25:06.796 --> 25:07.839
I can do that on my own.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.425
I've been doing in entire my life.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.095
Now get the fuck out of my head.
I am done with you.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.954
What song are you humming?

26:22.622 --> 26:23.540
It's a secret.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.835
Let's dance.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.426
Oh.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.315
What?

26:49.566 --> 26:50.817
Watch this.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.908
Whoo!

26:58.992 --> 27:01.828
-What is happening right now?
-Try it, it's fun.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.665
Come on, kick a can whenever you can.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.875
Ooh!

27:06.958 --> 27:08.126
That's right.

27:08.209 --> 27:11.796
In addition to being a kick-ass lawyer,
I'm also a fucking poet.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.590
Just like my dad.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.806
You know, when my mom was in the hospital,
I wasn't very--

27:21.890 --> 27:25.185
You know, what? Why don't you kick
the fucking can already?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.271
Come on, Burning Man.

27:30.523 --> 27:31.608
Kick it.

27:32.734 --> 27:33.985
That's not a kick!

27:34.694 --> 27:36.738
-This is a kick!

27:40.325 --> 27:42.786
-Are you okay?
-Mighty fine.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.761
What's wrong?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.894
I'm going to take you home, huh?

28:10.188 --> 28:14.192
I'm not going home
until we finish our dance.

28:14.275 --> 28:15.527
-Liv.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.617
There's a word in Hebrew.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.869
Mekhila.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.790
It means something like forgiveness.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.378
It comes from the same word as makhol.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.256
Which means dance.

Mekhila.
