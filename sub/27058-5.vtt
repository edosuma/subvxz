MATTHEW: <i>Once the world was full of wonders</i>

00:23.400 --> 00:26.040
<i>but it belongs to humans now.</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.794
<i>We creatures
have all but disappeared -</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:32.156
<i>demons, vampires and witches...</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:34.118
<i>hiding in plain sight</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:37.955
<i>fearful of discovery,
ill at ease, even with each other.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:41.914
<i>But, as my father used to say...</i>

00:42.800 --> 00:44.200
<i>in every ending...</i>

00:45.400 --> 00:47.551
<i>there is a new beginning.</i>

00:58.560 --> 01:00.040
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

01:04.480 --> 01:05.880
SHE SIGHS

01:11.480 --> 01:13.358
Witch water.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.320
Power like that
is rarely seen nowadays.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.160
What you did I've not seen
for many centuries.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.593
I didn't mean for it to happen.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.316
Witch water, witch wind...

01:31.720 --> 01:34.918
it's just more magic
that my body can't control.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
MARTHE: Give it time.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.990
DIANA SIGHS

01:44.600 --> 01:46.114
I should go to Madison.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.310
See if my aunts can help me.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.080
MARTHE: You're not going anywhere for now.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.030
And I made my son a promise.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.350
YSABEAU: Get dressed, we're going hunting.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.394
The lab's secured.
We've accounted for everything.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.393
It was witches.
Their scent was everywhere.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.233
They tried hacking into the computers.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.960
MIRIAM: They failed, of course.
Our servers are impenetrable.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.520
MATTHEW: I need to see it for myself.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.200
MATTHEW: This is Peter Knox's doing.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.471
It's because of you, Matthew.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.950
We've run this lab for years
without being noticed.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.714
Flown under the radar
of humans and creatures.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.076
Then suddenly, it's all jeopardised

02:37.160 --> 02:39.994
because you decide
to mate with a witch.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.992
That is enough, Miriam.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.072
Don't even begin to deny it.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.318
I'm the only one of us
who's mated before. I know the signs.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.199
Domenico knows, too.
Ysabeau phoned me.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.112
Domenico can go to hell.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.270
You're absolutely positive
nothing was stolen?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.319
Diana's DNA samples, her bloods?
They're secure.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.596
You think this was about Diana?
Of course this is about Diana.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.872
SHRILL TONE SOUNDS OUT.
HE SNIFFS

03:16.880 --> 03:18.473
I know that scent.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.395
Where are you going?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.480
Matthew, don't go there!

03:32.040 --> 03:33.076
SHE SCOFFS IN ANNOYANCE

03:33.560 --> 03:35.916
Call Baldwin.
It's time we told him the truth.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.399
What do you mean, they're mating?

03:45.440 --> 03:46.794
He's fighting it.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.480
He's gone back to Oxford
and she's at Sept-Tours.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.557
Ysabeau says
he will respect the Covenant.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.193
<i>He just needs to get his head straight.</i>

03:53.280 --> 03:54.896
I thought this was about
<i>The Book Of Life.</i>

03:54.920 --> 03:56.479
It was.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.040
It still is.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.759
But there's more to it than that.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.554
<i>Someone broke into the lab - witches.</i>

04:02.640 --> 04:05.599
<i>Matthew thinks they were looking
for information about Diana.</i>

04:05.640 --> 04:08.314
I was just thinking, with you being
a member of the Congregation

04:08.400 --> 04:10.790
and the head of our family that...
<i>That I can save him?</i>

04:11.960 --> 04:16.192
Matthew never destroys only himself,
Marcus.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.634
<i>He always drags the rest of us
down with him.</i>

04:21.480 --> 04:23.073
Well, I can't help him this time.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.834
If he breaks the rules...

04:27.040 --> 04:28.554
<i>he pays the price.</i>

04:29.720 --> 04:31.677
YSABEAU: I thought I'd take you hunting.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.275
Have you ever seen a vampire, hunt?

04:36.520 --> 04:39.991
<i>It's not as romantic
as humans believe.</i>

04:40.080 --> 04:42.800
<i>It's relentless and it's brutal.</i>

Do not come anywhere near me
when I'm hunting, do you understand?

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
Yes.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.513
If the animal scent
gets confused with yours

05:12.600 --> 05:14.956
I can't promise
I won't attack you instead.

DEEP BROODING MUSIC

06:01.600 --> 06:03.000
What do you want?

06:03.080 --> 06:05.390
Still marking undergraduate essays.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.480
Is that why you're jealous of Diana?
I'm not jealous of her.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.998
Or is this about preferment?

06:13.520 --> 06:17.036
Has Knox told you
you're going to rise in the ranks?

WOODPECKER ECHOES OUT

06:41.600 --> 06:43.990
MATTHEW: What were you
looking for, I wonder?

06:45.560 --> 06:46.560
Tell me.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.679
Makes me sick
that she'd debase herself with a vampire.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.634
BRANCH SUDDENLY CRACKS

07:02.400 --> 07:03.914
He was right.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.718
Could you be with my son
knowing that he kills?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.759
That hunting like this
is the only way for him to survive?

09:02.840 --> 09:05.355
If you're trying to frighten me
away from your son...

09:06.840 --> 09:08.354
you've failed.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.114
Marthe said this wouldn't be enough
to make you reconsider.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.360
DIANA: Well, she was right.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.914
Sylvia reports that
Miss Chamberlain took photos

10:09.000 --> 10:12.914
when she was inside the laboratory,
but De Clermont took her phone.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.359
Can Sylvia tell us
anything that Gillian saw?

10:16.440 --> 10:20.229
It appears the vampires
are studying witches' DNA.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.794
KNOX: What's Clermont up to?

10:26.680 --> 10:28.034
Testing witches?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.120
SIGISMUND: It's good
Miss Chamberlain discovered it.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.872
But why did she break into a vampire
laboratory in the first place?

10:35.360 --> 10:36.635
She could have been killed.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.672
KNOX: Matthew de Clermont
abducted her friend.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.514
She must have been acting
out of concern for Diana.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.631
Will one of us need to go to Oxford?

10:43.680 --> 10:46.115
Sylvia will handle Oxford
and Gillian Chamberlain.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.394
We'll be needed here.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.593
DIANA: Hey, Sarah.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.077
I'm sorry I haven't called.
<i>Oh, no matter.</i>

10:59.120 --> 11:02.272
Just talk to us now.
Honey, is everything OK?

11:03.440 --> 11:06.239
This Venetian vampire came.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.433
<i>He's on the Congregation.</i>

11:11.200 --> 11:13.396
He told me about the Covenant.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.835
How come I didn't know about this?
<i>Well...</i>

11:16.880 --> 11:19.395
You... You turned your back
on being a witch.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.154
You... You refused
to talk about magic.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.630
We didn't tell you because...

11:24.720 --> 11:26.518
it wasn't relevant to your life.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.597
Well, it is now.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.118
I love Matthew.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.032
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

11:42.160 --> 11:43.480
That's impossible.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.591
<i>Witches and vampires
can't be together.</i>

11:45.680 --> 11:48.354
Yeah, everyone keeps telling me that.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.795
But for me, there... there is no choice.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.550
You cannot put yourself
in that danger.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.109
I thought you two might understand.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.430
Honey, it's just the Congregation

12:00.520 --> 12:03.399
is going to do everything
in their power to stop

12:03.440 --> 12:05.318
<i>a mixed species relationship.</i>

12:05.400 --> 12:09.155
They don't get to choose who I love

12:09.240 --> 12:11.072
no matter the consequences.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.471
Honey, what does Matthew
have to say about all this?

12:15.880 --> 12:19.078
He... He hasn't told me
how he feels yet.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.640
HAMISH: You've left her with Ysabeau?

12:24.800 --> 12:27.235
A twisted idea of culture.
She loves me.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.153
Or she says she does.
And you love her?

12:33.560 --> 12:35.756
- Oh, Christ, Matthew.
- I know.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.072
I've been fooling myself that
the Congregation would no longer care.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.073
And somehow, she didn't even know
about the Covenant.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.199
Why should they tell us who to love?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.759
They haven't stopped me.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.834
A relationship between a demon
and a human doesn't threaten them

12:50.920 --> 12:52.718
but a vampire and a witch.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.111
This vampire, a De Clermont no less,
and this witch.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.396
Honestly, Hamish, she...

12:59.480 --> 13:01.676
she is astonishingly powerful.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.034
And she's clever and funny.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.513
She's full of courage.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.711
Then don't fall in the trap
of thinking for her.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.671
This isn't just about
the Congregation, is it?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.080
She's a historian.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.911
I am her latest research subject.
Ah!

13:20.000 --> 13:22.640
And you fear
she'll come to know your past?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.354
I know about it...

13:26.320 --> 13:27.470
and I love you.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.594
There are many things in this life
one can control.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.880
Love is not one of them.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.877
If you love her, then don't let
anything get in your way.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.958
Matthew has been living
for 1,500 years.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.429
You've been with him a few days.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.636
You know nothing about him.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.870
It's time you began to understand.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.350
Matthew was born in the village.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.750
He'd drive his father mad

14:08.440 --> 14:11.831
following him around,
picking up his work tools.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.792
He became a craftsman,
just like his father.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.352
This is what I wanted you to see.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.232
Matthew built it.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.471
SLOW, ORGAN-LIKE MUSIC

14:55.080 --> 14:56.878
"Peace."

14:58.080 --> 14:59.833
Perfect peace.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.878
"Blanca and Lucas."

15:05.520 --> 15:07.751
Who were Blanca and Lucas?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.399
When Matthew was human...

15:10.280 --> 15:12.351
he had a wife and son.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.874
What happened to them?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.912
Fever spread through the village.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.751
Lucas was just a small boy.
He'd not long turned five.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.032
He and Blanca were both struck
with the sickness

15:29.120 --> 15:30.679
and died.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.312
He laid this stone in their memory.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.036
Matthew's true love

15:43.120 --> 15:44.998
will always be Blanca.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.434
She gave him a son.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.434
You'll never be able
to bear a child by him.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.710
In 1,500 years,
Matthew has never mated.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.951
And I don't think he ever will.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.039
It's forever.
I will never leave him.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.230
Of course you will.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.119
Your life is fleeting
compared with a vampire's.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.998
When you are long gone...

16:13.000 --> 16:15.674
Matthew will have to carry on
living without you...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.076
just as he did with Blanca.

16:19.800 --> 16:20.995
WOMAN: Madame De Clermont.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.350
YSABEAU: Ah!

16:25.080 --> 16:26.480
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

16:27.280 --> 16:28.680
<i>Comment allez-vous?</i>

16:35.720 --> 16:37.439
BIRDSONG FILLS THE AIR

16:44.680 --> 16:46.831
I sired Matthew in the church.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.553
No one knew whether he slipped
or if he jumped.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.670
His body lay here on the ground.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.118
His legs and back broken.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.880
Dying man.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.353
I told him I could
take his suffering away

17:09.440 --> 17:11.715
and make him live forever.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.196
He was so out of his mind with pain.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.671
I don't think he completely
understood what he'd agreed to.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.799
If I could use my blood to save him,
I would.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.877
I felt the gods were giving me
an opportunity to make a child.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.634
And afterwards?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.874
How did he adapt?

17:36.520 --> 17:39.433
Matthew was in a rage at being sired.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.831
His need to feed was... endless.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.791
I can't imagine him like that.
He's always...

17:48.880 --> 17:50.997
so controlled.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.271
He would go away for periods of time.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.233
Philippe forbade me asking
where he'd been.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.437
Matthew was in a dark place

18:02.240 --> 18:05.119
doing things Philippe
didn't want my eyes to see.

18:07.560 --> 18:11.634
KNOX: I demand that Diana be removed
from the clutches of the De Clermont family

18:11.720 --> 18:13.791
and be brought back to the witches.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.359
Last night, the equilibrium between
the species was further threatened

18:20.440 --> 18:22.955
when Matthew de Clermont
brutally attacked a witch.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.136
Gillian Chamberlain was attacked
because she was trespassing

18:27.160 --> 18:28.640
on vampire territory.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.833
Rules are rules.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.752
We won't survive
if the vampires continue

18:32.840 --> 18:34.718
to abuse their power
in the Congregation.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.197
Careful, Agatha.
KNOX: We must question Diana Bishop.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.511
And bring Matthew de Clermont
to account.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.798
I offer my services
to retrieve the witch.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.996
Be assured, I can be
a little more persuasive

18:49.840 --> 18:51.559
than Domenico.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.030
AGATHA: We can't leave the responsibility
of her retrieval

18:54.120 --> 18:56.237
in the hands of just one creature.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.874
A representative from each species
should go to Sept-Tours.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.270
Sept-Tours is my property.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.353
I will not have a swarm of creatures
invading my home.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.198
I will go and get Diana Bishop myself.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.632
TENSE MUSIC

19:20.920 --> 19:22.593
A DOOR CLUNKS AND ECHOES OUT

19:25.480 --> 19:29.793
SATU: We must find a way to look inside
Diana, see how she's hiding her power.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.155
An opening spell.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.437
You can't put a living witch
through that.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.912
They rarely survive the trauma.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.277
That sort of dark magic's unreliable
and highly dangerous.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.719
It's almost impossible to master,
anyway.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.190
It affects the spell-caster greatly.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.196
What if Baldwin wants her for himself?

19:52.680 --> 19:54.512
She's on his land.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.997
We have no choice
but to let him go.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.710
Have you ever considered working
with other vampires against him?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.634
Have you been talking with them?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.553
No, of course not.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.472
GATE CLANGS. Domenico's a sneak.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.319
And Gerbert... Gerbert is unspeakable.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.757
It's long been rumoured that he's
kept a witch captive for centuries

20:18.840 --> 20:19.910
in his thrall.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.077
You keep away from them both.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.353
Humans, they should be given the choice

20:37.400 --> 20:39.596
to either accept us or not.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.876
A couple of witches at uni
know what I am.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.856
Well, there's a big difference between
a couple of witches knowing what you are

20:44.880 --> 20:46.200
and all humans knowing.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.319
The Congregation are running scared.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.829
The vampires and witches
want to shut us up

20:50.920 --> 20:52.070
keep us on the outside.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.190
They're afraid of us.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.336
They're afraid of what we might do
if we come together

20:56.360 --> 20:59.000
which is only natural,
it's how we're supposed to be.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.616
And the thing is, not all humans
are ignorant when it comes to us.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.792
FEMALE DAEMON: Really?!
What humans are we talking about?

21:04.840 --> 21:07.150
I've got mates at uni and they're fine...
Hold on a sec.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.833
Alright. Cool, nice one.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.755
Hey. Where have you been?
Sorry, I, erm... I...

21:12.840 --> 21:16.675
I fell asleep and I had this
really weird dream.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.994
Agatha and the witch
were in it and my dad

21:20.040 --> 21:23.192
saying over and over
I have to tell the truth.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.600
Can we talk about this later?

21:24.640 --> 21:27.792
I mean, people are actually here, Soph.
They came.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.999
Look, the forum actually worked.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.356
SOPHIE: I know, Nat, but I figured it out.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.757
The dream. I, erm...
I need to speak to your mum.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.150
I have to tell her about my family
and what I am.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.232
Soph, you can't. I know, but...

21:41.320 --> 21:43.994
She's a Congregation member, OK?
Think of the baby.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.720
It's not safe.
But she'll understand.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.554
And I can't pass the statue on
without her.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.474
The witch needs it.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.351
OK.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.232
SOPHIE SIGHS - Let's do it.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.760
Yeah.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.954
DRAWERS CLUNKS OPEN

24:42.880 --> 24:44.030
How are you?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.470
Ysabeau has been
keeping me entertained.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.194
<i>Telling me stories about you.</i>

24:50.280 --> 24:52.237
Yes, I was afraid of that.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.320
<i>According to her</i>

24:53.360 --> 24:55.750
you're a mix between Superman

24:55.800 --> 24:56.916
<i>and Lancelot.</i>

24:57.880 --> 24:59.553
Well, I try.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.916
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- Yes.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.912
Yes, it doesn't look like
anything's been taken.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.191
Was it witches? Peter Knox?

25:12.240 --> 25:14.516
I don't want you to worry about that.

25:23.640 --> 25:24.640
OK.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.960
It's late. I'm gonna go to bed.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.680
Goodnight, Matthew.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.676

26:41.840 --> 26:43.240
What are you doing?

26:44.240 --> 26:47.517
Comparing Diana's DNA
to pre-11th-century witches.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.196
MIRIAM: I already did that.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.191
The programme didn't recognise
her markers.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.240
Genetic mutations over the centuries
made an exact match impossible, but...

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
HE SIGHS

26:58.520 --> 27:00.830
I compared the actual physical data.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.992
The similarities were unmistakable.
Take a look.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.080
Go on.

27:12.520 --> 27:13.874
How is this possible?

27:15.560 --> 27:17.756
Everything before
pointed to species decline.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.951
This changes everything. Everything.

27:24.680 --> 27:25.750
Help me run them again.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.870
I need to get back and tell Diana
what we've discovered.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.757
DRAMATIC MUSIC

27:44.360 --> 27:47.478
MARTHE: Good morning, Diana.
Matthew called for you.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.113
He's on his way.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.629
DIANA EXHALES DEEPLY

28:05.080 --> 28:06.196
Tell me.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.230
If I do...

28:10.640 --> 28:13.712
there's no turning back.
You have to understand what that means.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.752
Ysabeau made me understand.

28:18.920 --> 28:19.920
Tell me.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.560
YSABEAU BREATHES DEEPLY

28:35.000 --> 28:36.434
From this moment...

28:38.080 --> 28:39.400
we will always be one.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.675
Diana...

28:51.400 --> 28:52.675
I love you.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.509
Do you know what you have just done?

29:21.640 --> 29:25.111
If we're not welcome here,
Diana and I will leave.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.598
Have I ever deserted you?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.910
No, <i>Maman.</i> Then why would I now?

29:36.160 --> 29:38.356
You are my beloved son.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.630
And you are now my daughter.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.915
Your fight is now my fight.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.755
If you have the courage
to love my son...

30:04.960 --> 30:07.270
you have no need to fear your power.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.673
The women of the De Clermont family
defend themselves.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.876
And you will be no different.

What is it? What can you see?

31:22.360 --> 31:25.353
Is Diana Bishop
the witch from the prophesy?

31:25.560 --> 31:30.237
Beware of the witch
with the blood of the lion and the wolf

31:30.840 --> 31:34.356
for with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.794
I know that. I know.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.840
Speak to me
or you'll get no more of this.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.440
Two.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.833

Where can I find her?

31:55.800 --> 31:58.110
MERIDIANA:
Beware the witch with the blood...

31:58.160 --> 31:59.913
of the lion and the wolf

32:00.000 --> 32:03.789
for with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.590
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf

32:07.680 --> 32:08.796

32:09.680 --> 32:12.479

SINISTER MUSIC

32:36.120 --> 32:39.750
You think that lighting a fire
and pouring some wine will help them?

32:40.760 --> 32:42.160
He loves her, Ysabeau.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.878
They'll need more than love.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.237
The witches will think that Diana
has turned her back on her own kind

32:49.320 --> 32:51.357
and they will come.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.514
And when they come,
her weakness will put us all at risk.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.230
She will find a way to use
her magic to protect herself.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.040
Then she'd better stop
behaving like some human

33:02.120 --> 33:04.191
and find a way fast.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.393
MATTHEW: I need to show you something.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.792
What is this?

33:22.880 --> 33:25.793
When I was in Oxford
I worked on your DNA samples.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.554
These are the results. You ready?

33:31.960 --> 33:34.350
We don't understand everything yet

33:34.840 --> 33:37.309
but so far we've discovered
that you have...

33:38.320 --> 33:43.554
every genetic marker
we've ever seen in a witch.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.838
You have the elemental markers
of air and water.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.877
Witch wind and witch water. Mmm.

33:50.440 --> 33:53.239
You also have earth

33:53.320 --> 33:55.960
which means you're likely,
more than likely

33:56.040 --> 33:57.713
to be able to cast spells.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.760
SHE SCOFFS

34:00.760 --> 34:02.752
It's bizarre.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.071
I've never felt connected to magic

34:05.160 --> 34:06.992
like Sarah or Em.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.556
Or... even Gillian.

34:10.639 --> 34:11.639
MATTHEW: Mmm.

34:13.280 --> 34:16.637
Does this test tell us
why this is happening now?

34:16.719 --> 34:20.839
Well, your magic's behaving as though
it's waking up from a long sleep.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.956
It's restless.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.157
It wants to get out.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.359
My parents were persecuted
because of their powers.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.793
Hey.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.591
We will face this together.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.792
Otherwise, you'll always be running.

34:51.480 --> 34:55.838
I need to talk to you
about Oxford, Diana.

34:57.360 --> 35:01.195
I don't want to hear
about Oxford, Matthew.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.874
MATTHEW AND DIANA GIGGLE

35:14.560 --> 35:15.596
MATTHEW: So...

35:17.840 --> 35:20.435
what does the distinguished historian
know about...

35:22.120 --> 35:23.236
bundling?

35:23.680 --> 35:25.717
- DIANA: Bundling?
- Mmm.

35:25.800 --> 35:31.398
Well, I'm familiar with the custom,
but it <i>is</i> 2018.

35:34.640 --> 35:35.994
GLASSES CLINK

35:49.320 --> 35:50.390
DIANA BREATHES HEAVILY

35:50.440 --> 35:51.440
MATTHEW WHISPERS: Diana.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.116
You may not like what you see.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.633
SHE INHALES ABRUPTLY

36:33.360 --> 36:34.510
SHE WHISPERS: Oh.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.914
Oh, Matthew.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.640
That one was made by
the tip of a broadsword

36:43.680 --> 36:45.797
during the 100 Years War.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.118
Think of them as, er...

36:53.240 --> 36:55.800
a map of my life.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.393
I want to hunt down
everyone who hurt you.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.754
HE WHISPERS: My love.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.759
With you my life has a beginning,
a middle and an end.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.955
When you're gone my life will be over.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.031
SHE EXHALES IN PLEASURE

38:08.440 --> 38:10.875
THEY BOTH GIGGLE

38:22.600 --> 38:24.671
SHE WHISPERS:
I don't think that's bundling.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.120
THEY GIGGLE

38:27.400 --> 38:28.675
Well...

38:29.320 --> 38:30.879
it is in France.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.192
DEEP BROODING MUSIC

38:48.160 --> 38:50.072
ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC

38:51.040 --> 38:52.235
INDISTINCT CHATTER

39:21.280 --> 39:23.670
I wouldn't bother going home.

39:23.720 --> 39:27.873
Gerbert's very disappointed in you.
Matthew wasn't even in Oxford.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.269
It wasn't my fault.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.799
I know where he is.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.120
You see, unlike you

39:37.200 --> 39:40.034
he's been able to move on.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.157
He has a new woman.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.840
A witch.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.957
Diana Bishop.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.236
He only wants her for her powers.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.439
That's all.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.637
Matthew hates witches.
Not this one.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.039
He's in love with her.
He's in love with me!

39:59.080 --> 40:00.480
Matthew's mine.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.158
He belongs to me.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.033
What are you waiting for?

40:07.440 --> 40:09.159
She's at Sept-Tours.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.630
I can't go without
Gerbert's permission.

40:12.680 --> 40:13.680
Really?

40:43.560 --> 40:45.438
LIGHT PIANO MUSIC

41:18.240 --> 41:19.640
DIANA BREATHES HEAVILY

41:28.600 --> 41:30.034
A BUSH SUDDENLY RUSTLES

41:37.720 --> 41:39.154
SUDDEN WHOOSHING

41:39.600 --> 41:40.875
DIANA SCREAMS

41:43.160 --> 41:44.480
EM: Diana!

41:44.520 --> 41:46.557
She's in pain. What did you see?

41:47.840 --> 41:48.910
SHE GROANS IN PAIN

41:50.240 --> 41:52.160
I'll kill you if you've harmed her!
Where is she?

41:52.200 --> 41:55.159
MARTHE: I caught her scent in the garden,
but mixed with another.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.416
You've clearly involved in this.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.160
I assure you
this has nothing to do with me.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.638
Gerbert took her then.
I know what he's capable of.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.639
Is this witch really worth
going to war against our own for?

42:05.680 --> 42:06.636
Yes!

42:06.680 --> 42:09.514
This is what happens to witches
who don't co-operate.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.520
SHE SCREAMS - THUDDING

42:12.305 --> 42:18.477
