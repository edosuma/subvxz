¶ Boom, boom, boom, boom, ¶

03:15.863 --> 03:17.429

03:19.633 --> 03:21.867

He's down there every
day, hopin' and waitin'.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.361
Couldn't hit

05:38.572 --> 05:40.872
Bad rat? Rat here no good.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.841
Make people sick.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.811
Stick to snake.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.653
No! No, thanks.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.722
You captain Doyle? Yeah.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.458
I'm jhon.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.893
Where's captain Cahill?

06:01.895 --> 06:04.463
Up trail,

06:04.465 --> 06:05.897
but you rest.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.467
We eat, then go.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.469
I'll wait for you at the top.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.489
Try it with a 60-pound pack.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.684
Not your fault, huh?

06:59.686 --> 07:02.187
Not used to air up high.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.160
You know captain Sam?

07:08.162 --> 07:11.797
Uh-uh. I know of him.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.832
Where I'm from,
everybody knows of him.

07:13.834 --> 07:17.202
He's a legend. So where is he?

07:39.593 --> 07:40.826
Cahill.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.160
Sam right there.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.829
Where? Which hut? Where is he?

07:43.831 --> 07:44.863
No, no. Sam right there.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.902
Cahill?

07:52.906 --> 07:56.608
Captain Samuel Cahill,
sog/op 39?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.877
Hello?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.212
Stop.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.700
You're the guest of honor.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.936
Um...

08:28.575 --> 08:29.708
Took you longer than expected.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.843
We're waiting for you.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.211
Have a little trouble
on the hill?

08:34.780 --> 08:36.948
Um...

08:36.950 --> 08:38.850
They always
have a wine ceremony

08:38.852 --> 08:41.586
to celebrate the arrival
of an important visitor.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.788
Of course,
they'd have a wine ceremony

08:43.789 --> 08:45.690
to celebrate
the arrival of Tuesday.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.928
It's numpai... rice wine.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.598
And it tastes like a combination
of sugar water and vomit.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.234
It's a little early in the day
to be hammered, isn't it?

08:56.236 --> 08:59.838
You have to drink it.
All of it.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.208
And whatever you do,
don't spit it out.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.710
It's an incredible
insult to the chief.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.583
If that's it,
maybe we could go...

09:44.585 --> 09:48.219
not quite. You have to meet po.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.721
Po. Po. Po.

09:49.723 --> 09:50.956
Po. Po. Po.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.958
Po? Cahill: Yeah.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.926
He's a village elder or what?

09:54.928 --> 09:55.927
Kind of.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.629
Here he comes.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.631
Don't turn around,
and close your eyes.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.699
Po will wanna touch your face.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.233
Excuse me?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.269
You don't want to insult po.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.838
It's worse than
spitting out the wine.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.707
Close your eyes.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.309
Close my eyes.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.397
This is serious
n.V.A. Territory, captain.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.199
They know the montagnard
are helping us,

10:34.201 --> 10:35.333
so they come around here
all the time

10:35.335 --> 10:37.969
looking for any excuse
to give 'em hell.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.639
Rule number one:
Don't give them one.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.340
That's why you couldn't
fly here directly...

10:42.342 --> 10:44.809
why I only come here
when it's safe.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.745
And rule number 2?

10:46.747 --> 10:49.147
Never forget rule number one.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.851
I think I can remember that.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.319
I leave here Saturday.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.187
That gives me a week
to get you ready.

10:56.189 --> 10:56.955
Oh, I'm prepared, captain.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.791
I can do the job.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.961
And how you gonna do it?
By the book?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.329
There's a better way?

11:06.433 --> 11:13.238
Huh. Look. I got
a few things to tie up.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.740
Jhon'll show you around
and answer any questions.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.176
Captain, I didn't come
here for a village tour.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.412
My orders are
to go to the trail.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.213
You don't start
movin' the big stuff

11:22.215 --> 11:23.815
until after midnight.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.817
Until then, captain Doyle,

11:25.819 --> 11:28.420
I suggest you start
getting to know this village.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.723
These people have been the difference
between life and death for me.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.704
What's that?

11:45.706 --> 11:47.939
The forest gave us so much,

11:47.941 --> 11:50.942
we pay tribute for protection
of the good spirits.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.854
So she's not just a big pet.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.857
No, no. We use elephants.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.760
My father, his father,
his father, forever.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.929
War drives elephants South.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.265
Dak nhe lucky to have one.
Dak nhe are blessed.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.334
I'm happy for you.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.403
Look, let's...

12:19.906 --> 12:21.873
let's go see the trail.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.742
Sam say we go later.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.343
Yeah, I know, but you're
gonna be working for me now.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.246
Forget Sam. Where's the trail?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.415
I forget.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.451
Candy you got?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.987
No, no. Get... no.
No candy. Get away.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.323
Please. Candy. I share.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.891
Kids: Candy! Candy!

12:39.893 --> 12:41.993
Candy! Candy! Candy!

12:41.995 --> 12:43.995
All right.
All right. All right.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.431
I only have one.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.267
Understand? One.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.369
One... hey!

12:59.880 --> 13:02.547
Oh, this is great.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.915
That's it?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.284
Cahill: Ho chi minh trail.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.887
Disappointed? I was.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.557
I expected something a
little bit more established.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.526
That's the beauty of it.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.261
You call in an air strike,

13:16.263 --> 13:17.529
blow the heck out of it,

13:17.531 --> 13:18.863
and they move it.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.900
They use it
to supply an entire army.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.434
It never stops.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.838
Oh, look at that.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.008
Shoulder-fire
surface-to-air missiles.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.343
Whoa.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.579
Second set of s.A. Sevens we've
seen come South this week.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.580
Really?

15:27.961 --> 15:30.295
You bring bad spirit!

15:30.297 --> 15:32.463
It wasn't my fault!

15:32.465 --> 15:33.698
D-d-Doyle!

15:33.700 --> 15:35.033
It wasn't my fault!

15:35.035 --> 15:36.567
The kid took the candy.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.038
He stole the candy,
and then he ran off.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.572
It wasn't...

15:43.476 --> 15:46.945
ok, it was my fault.
It was my fault.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.013
I'm sorry about the elephant.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.683
If I could bring him
back to life, I would.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.385
We no want you. You go!

15:54.387 --> 15:55.887
No, wait. Fine!

15:55.888 --> 15:57.388
I never intended to work with
these people in the first place.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.489
Maybe you can!

15:58.491 --> 15:59.958
Maybe I can what?!

15:59.960 --> 16:02.593
The tradition here is
that at high noon

16:02.595 --> 16:03.695
on the last day of wapasat,

16:03.697 --> 16:05.496
the new moon festival,

16:05.498 --> 16:09.033
the king of fire enters on
top of the village elephant.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.401
Now we have to do it by Friday.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.669
That's pushin' it.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.304
Wait. Do what by Friday?

16:13.306 --> 16:17.041
Duan, I give you my word

16:17.043 --> 16:20.044
that when the king of fire
enters the village this wapasat,

16:20.046 --> 16:23.281
he will not do so
on his own feet.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.583
He is going to get you
a new elephant.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.690
I am not getting them
an elephant. No! No!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.000
These people have risked
their lives helping us.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.501
Well, then let's
get them a tractor.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.502
A tractor would last
8 minutes in that big...

16:44.504 --> 16:45.870
well, then don't
get them anything.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.237
Oh, come on! What
are you talkin' about?!

16:47.240 --> 16:48.823
You've been
in the jungle too long!

16:48.824 --> 16:50.407
What about you?!
Will you both shut up?!

16:55.048 --> 16:58.416
The village provides important support
for operations in the region.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.419
If we don't get them an
elephant by Friday afternoon,

17:01.421 --> 17:03.054
we lose the village.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.756
We don't need the village.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.656
It's as simple as that.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.029
Well, maybe we don't
need the village,

17:11.031 --> 17:12.763
but then again, maybe we do.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.665
I think we err on the side of
caution this time, captain Doyle.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.569
You two go out and
get them their elephant.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.705
We'll need some men, sir.
5 should do it.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.342
You get 2.

17:24.344 --> 17:28.046
2 of the very best
and brightest I can borrow.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.749
Now get outta here.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.485
Whatever you do,
don't embarrass me.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.787
Don't worry, sir.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.358
Now, hold on a second.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.493
Aren't we forgetting something?

17:42.495 --> 17:45.063
Who's gonna lead this
delightful little operation?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.664
I am. I am.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.833
Well, I'm sure you both
have very good reasons.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.701
The thing is,
I really don't care.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.838
So odds or evens? One.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.843
Evens. 2...3.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.512
Marvin gaye:
¶ youse a son of a gun ¶

18:01.514 --> 18:03.247
¶ oh, baby ¶

18:03.249 --> 18:04.615
¶ youse a son of a gun ¶

18:04.617 --> 18:06.317
spec-4 ashford?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.819
No, sir. He's in the hooch.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.423
Ashford!

18:12.425 --> 18:14.425
Haul your butt out here!

18:14.427 --> 18:17.361
Sir? He ain't comin' out.

18:21.734 --> 18:22.767
Why is that, red?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.802
Well, he's short 7 days.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.704
Goes back to the world
next Monday.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.707
This man is taking no chances.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.609
He ain't even come out
of his hooch for 2 days.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.482
Troop.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.785
Grenade!

18:40.787 --> 18:42.386
Oh, that's really funny.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.548
Who's the hilarious son of a...

18:50.296 --> 18:51.362
my mistake.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.606
Pack your gear

19:01.608 --> 19:03.708
and be ready to move out
at 1300 hours.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.344
You've been reassigned.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.546
This is
some kind of joke, right?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.781
It's a joke, all right.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.517
You can't reassign me.

19:12.519 --> 19:16.387
Sir, I'm catching the
freedom bird in 7 days.

19:17.757 --> 19:21.425
168 hours.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.861
I'm so short.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.864
I'm so short...
1300 hours, ashford.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.837
¶ Dang me, dang me ¶

19:32.839 --> 19:35.706
¶ they ought to take
a rope and hang me ¶

19:35.708 --> 19:38.643
¶ high from the highest tree ¶

19:38.645 --> 19:41.512
¶ would you weep for me? ¶

19:47.554 --> 19:51.556
Dang it. Dang it!

19:54.694 --> 19:56.327
Spec-5 farley?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.862
Yes, sir!

19:57.864 --> 19:59.363
So what's the mission, sir?

19:59.365 --> 20:00.631
Unless you can't tell me,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.333
like if we're operatin'
on a need-to-know basis.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.734
We are, and you don't.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.370
Yes, sir.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.606
Where you from, farley?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.641
Iowa, sir. Or as my Uncle
Fergus liked to put it,

20:10.643 --> 20:14.312
I owe a hell of a lot of
money on them farm loans.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.781
He doesn't say much about it
since the thresher accident.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.800
Mama likes to say you can
hardly tell anything happened

20:18.801 --> 20:20.818
unless you get up real
close, but I beg to differ.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.420
You been on a farm?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.621
Yes, sir. My daddy
owns a dairy farm,

20:23.623 --> 20:25.823
seein' as I bein'
from the corn state.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.325
So you've had
experience with animals.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.659
Yes, sir.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.328
Just none of 'em good.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.395
I don't know what it is.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.763
Animals just
don't seem to like me.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.632
Never have,
probably never will.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.700
And that didn't make life
easier growin' up on a farm.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.401
Tell you that.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.586
Shoot, one of the main reasons

20:38.587 --> 20:39.770
why I joined the army
in the first place.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.506
Get away from
all the dang animals.

20:48.548 --> 20:53.517
Gilman, hey, I need
25 submariners at 300 per. Ok?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.823
Gilman, may I remind you
I have friends

20:58.825 --> 21:00.825
with absolutely no regard for
the sanctity of human life, ok?

21:00.827 --> 21:04.395
I say the word, I have your head in
a bag on my desk tomorrow morning.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.565
Hang on. General. It's done.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.534
425 per.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.470
Pleasure doing business
with you, sir.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.472
Yes, sir, and give my regards

21:14.474 --> 21:15.806
to your lovely wife
and daughter.

21:15.808 --> 21:19.543
I didn't mean
anything by that, sir.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.878
I gotta go. I got a call
on the other line.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.280
All right, thank you.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.547
Gilman, so where were we?

21:23.549 --> 21:25.650
I think
I had your head in a bag,

21:25.652 --> 21:28.552
350? Done.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.656
All right. Send them to general
John Richardson in danang, please.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.291
Thanks, pal.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.525
And, oh, by the way, gilman?

21:34.527 --> 21:36.661
I'd still let somebody
taste your food.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.538
I thought you were dead.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.307
You mean you hoped I was dead.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.376
What can I do for you guys?

21:52.378 --> 21:53.778
You're a requisitions officer.

21:53.780 --> 21:58.449
Well, we require something.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.356
Not even funny.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.458
We need an elephant
by tomorrow.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.460
Or you don't you think
you could do it?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.762
Please.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.564
Spare me
the I-dare-you crap, Cahill.

22:13.566 --> 22:17.535
Everybody knows I can get
anything anywhere anytime.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.371
Just so happens I'm
startin' 5 days of r-and-r.

22:20.373 --> 22:24.542
This time tomorrow I'll be sittin'
on a beach in Hawaii, my friend.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.577
You're getting us the elephant.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.980
Or what?

22:28.981 --> 22:31.382
You gonna still try to hold that
business with the 64th over my head?

22:31.384 --> 22:33.651
Come on. So the pork
was a little off.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.453
A little off?

22:35.455 --> 22:38.489
I know men who spent a week on the
latrine because of that pork.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.624
It's old news, Cahill.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.892
I got too many friends
in high places

22:41.894 --> 22:43.761
to go down for something
small-time like that now.

22:43.763 --> 22:47.565
Oh, I know other things
about you, poole.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.667
Let me tell you
something, Cahill.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.435
There isn't anything you know

22:51.437 --> 22:54.805
that's gonna keep me from gettin'
on that plane to Honolulu.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.585
Doyle: 180 Miles
in the middle of a war.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.387
We can get a truck and drive
it up close to dak nhe.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.455
That'll take about 3 days.

23:11.457 --> 23:12.690
And another day to walk it in.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.592
We'll get there by Friday.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.927
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of air travel.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.696
I lined up a cargo plane

23:18.698 --> 23:20.765
to meet us at an airstrip
near ban don, ok?

23:20.767 --> 23:23.100
We fly the elephant down
to this old CIA airstrip

23:23.102 --> 23:24.902
about a 3-hour walk
from dak nhe,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.771
then your montagnard friends
have their elephant

23:26.773 --> 23:28.773
by 2:00 this afternoon, I'm
sitting on the beach in waikiki

23:28.775 --> 23:30.174
in time to see the sunset.

23:30.176 --> 23:34.412
And you wanted a week!
Good job, poole!

23:34.414 --> 23:36.547
We're coming up on ban don now.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.483
There's no place to land
in the rice paddies.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.453
We'll have to go to an I.Z.
Behind the village.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.854
It was real hot here
2 weeks ago.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.424
Probably ok now.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.426
Probably? We're gonna
land on a "probably"?

23:48.428 --> 23:49.660
Lock and load!

24:11.150 --> 24:13.150
Hey, this isn't that bad.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.686
It's kind of peaceful, really.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.556
All right, move out.

24:26.599 --> 24:29.500
Well, Cahill,
you want elephants,

24:29.502 --> 24:31.602
I give you elephants.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.505
Beautiful elephants, I might
add, at no extra cost.

24:34.507 --> 24:35.840
Knowing you, poole,

24:35.842 --> 24:38.843
they're probably big
puppets with men inside.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.479
Let's go.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.162
Y b'ham?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.701
Let me handle the negotiation.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.803
I already talked to
this guy on the radio.

25:05.805 --> 25:09.840
Thinks he's tough, but I'm
gonna crack him like a walnut.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.167
Oh, you're killing me.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.836
What's the problem?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.271
I thought you could
negotiate anything.

25:40.273 --> 25:41.939
I can with leverage. Problem
is we don't have any.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.707
He doesn't care if he sells
the elephant or not.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.276
We don't make his price,
he blows the deal.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.245
What's his price?

25:47.246 --> 25:49.213
Problem number 2.
He wants 60,000 piasters.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.214
The requisition form
captain Doyle gave me

25:50.216 --> 25:51.248
is only good for 50, so...

25:51.250 --> 25:53.784
that's it?
Hell, 10,000 piasters...

25:53.786 --> 25:54.852
that's only about 150 bucks.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.787
We can raise that between us.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.256
No. You tell him 50,000
is our final offer.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.941
We can do it.

26:00.942 --> 26:02.625
Private funds can't be used
for an official purchase

26:02.628 --> 26:04.728
as per regulations.
It's also an order.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.231
Understood? Tell him.

26:08.834 --> 26:13.304
I get it. It's a perfect
way out for you.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.939
You blow the deal,
and the mission is over.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.609
It's what you wanted
from the beginning.

26:18.611 --> 26:21.779
We're going back to the I.Z.
And call for a ride.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.847
Let's go.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.183
Poole, let's move it.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.285
Ok, 50,000.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.727
You're quite
a negotiator, Doyle.

26:39.265 --> 26:43.334
Gracious sir, perhaps now
we could go to the river

26:43.336 --> 26:44.735
and pick our elephant.

26:44.737 --> 26:47.705
River? 50,000 don't
get elephant in river.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.307
50,000 get you Bo-tat.

26:50.309 --> 26:53.210
Bo-tat!

26:56.315 --> 26:57.314
Uh-oh.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.253
Beat it.

27:11.897 --> 27:15.265
Bo-tat is she, not he.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.935
Boy is linh.
Boy go with Bo-tat.

27:17.937 --> 27:21.338
What? No, boy no go
with Bo-tat.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.741
Boy go with Bo-tat.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.275
We're going to a village
far away.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.644
I'm sure linh's family...

27:26.646 --> 27:29.647
boy has no family. All killed.

27:29.649 --> 27:30.881
In the war?

27:30.883 --> 27:33.283
No. Hit by falling star.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.920
Yes, in war.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.922
Which side?

27:38.924 --> 27:40.391
It matter?

27:40.393 --> 27:43.227
I think it's better
if the boy stays here.

27:43.229 --> 27:47.331
He not belong here.
From north, not our people.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.900
We might as well
take him with us.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.236
N-no. We are not
taking a kid with us.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.871
He'll be my responsibility.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.239
No, captain. All right.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.877
Anyone else here know
how to work an elephant?

27:59.879 --> 28:01.445
I was in love with
a fat woman once,

28:01.447 --> 28:02.946
but she never listened to me.

28:02.948 --> 28:06.984
Oh. Mr. Y b'ham,
you must know how

28:06.986 --> 28:08.452
to work an elephant,
right, sir?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.854
I live with elephants
all my life.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.423
I learn nothing?

28:12.425 --> 28:16.860
Is this guy sarcastic,
or is it just me?

28:25.337 --> 28:27.705
Great. Would you like
to come with us, sir?

28:27.707 --> 28:29.740
20,000 piasters.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.241
Deal.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.494
Good job, Doyle.

28:33.495 --> 28:35.746
I think Mr. Y b'ham
would be a wonderful choice.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.214
Just one problem.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.882
What?

28:38.884 --> 28:41.418
He doesn't stare into space
because he's a wise old soul.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.253
He does it because
he's blind as a bat.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.256
Y b'ham not blind.
Y b'ham can...

28:46.258 --> 28:49.359
y b'ham is blind.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.230
10,000 piasters?

29:09.215 --> 29:10.347
Farley: It's a nice view.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.415
Ashford: What nice view?

29:11.417 --> 29:14.918
All I can see
is an elephant's butt.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.230
<i>Parlez-vous francais?</i>

29:27.767 --> 29:29.466
Any luck?

29:29.468 --> 29:32.369
I tried vietnamese,
Cambodian, French,

29:32.371 --> 29:34.271
and 3 dialects of jeh.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.343
Keep an eye on him.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.979
He's on an elephant.
He's hard to miss.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.281
You know what I mean.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.350
We don't know which side
killed his family.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.452
It could've been us.
He might hate Americans.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.987
We don't know, and until we do,

29:49.989 --> 29:51.321
he can't be trusted. Doyle...

29:51.323 --> 29:54.291
he right. Linh
can't be trusted.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.997
Linh no trust Americans.
Americans not trust linh.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.367
Everything's number one, a-ok.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.524
That elephant just came along
to say good-bye, right?

30:27.526 --> 30:29.893
You're not actually thinking
of putting that on my plane?

30:29.895 --> 30:30.894
What's the problem?

30:30.896 --> 30:33.430
What's the problem?

30:33.432 --> 30:34.464
It's an elephant.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.966
Yeah, but, major...

30:35.968 --> 30:37.568
no, no, no. You see,
you cannot put an elephant

30:37.570 --> 30:39.336
on an airplane.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.305
Suppose it starts to panic
and starts moving around?

30:41.307 --> 30:43.473
I lose trim,
the plane goes down.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.008
We all buy the farm.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.577
That's important,
what he just said.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.245
No, no, no.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.847
It's not getting
aboard the plane

30:49.849 --> 30:51.281
unless it's dead.

30:51.283 --> 30:54.451
Now, I'd be happy to oblige...

30:54.453 --> 30:56.486
If you've all grown
too attached to it.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.588
No!

30:57.590 --> 30:59.590
Linh, it's ok.

30:59.592 --> 31:02.226
No one's gonna shoot Bo-tat.

31:04.463 --> 31:05.996
Doyle.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.870
Poole.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.371
Do you have a package

31:14.373 --> 31:16.373
for a Dr. David poole,
d.V.M., on board?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.941
Yeah, I do.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.918
Here we go, gentlemen.
Animal tranquilizer.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.387
She won't move an inch.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.289
Bo-tat's gonna take
a big nap-nap.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.258
Hey, nice try,
but I don't care.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.593
See, my orders say nothing
about lifting an elephant.

31:36.595 --> 31:40.297
Gentlemen, you have a good war.

31:40.299 --> 31:45.002
Ahem, major, maybe
you should read this.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.239
Ok?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.474
This operation's top-secret,

31:50.476 --> 31:51.575
and that's why
you never heard anything

31:51.577 --> 31:53.010
about our large mammal
friend over there.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.544
As a matter of fact,
if anybody asks,

31:54.546 --> 31:57.014
you're moving
a shipment of tuna.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.448
Tuna?

31:58.450 --> 32:00.284
Tuna.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.687
Moving an elephant.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.023
What elephant?

32:11.030 --> 32:12.396
You got 10 minutes.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.333
Gentlemen, I'm responsible
for anything

32:16.335 --> 32:17.601
that goes onto that cargo hold.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.304
Now, if that thing
even twitches,

32:20.306 --> 32:22.472
you're gonna see
an elephant fly.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.309
Hey, that's funny.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.446
All right, yeah.
What's with the letter?

32:29.448 --> 32:32.683
John westmoreland.
Top priority.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.484
Got 8 left.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.287
Now, couldn't get
elephant tranquilizer

32:37.289 --> 32:38.588
'cause the only place
that has it is the London zoo.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.724
It would take too long
to ship, so...

32:40.726 --> 32:42.259
And what's that?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.027
Water buffalo tranquilizer.

32:44.029 --> 32:46.363
It's not as strong,
but my vet guy says

32:46.365 --> 32:49.399
you just give her a little
more, it should work.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.672
My word.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.041
I guess we give her one now,
and then we give her...

32:58.043 --> 32:59.609
One later if she needs it.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.312
How are we supposed to get her
to swallow one of these?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.748
Well... ahem... actually,
according to this,

33:04.750 --> 33:07.384
she's not supposed
to swallow it.

33:09.722 --> 33:12.456
Well, Dr. David poole...

33:12.458 --> 33:14.491
oh, no, no, no, no.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.293
I said I would
help you guys out,

33:16.295 --> 33:18.028
but putting my hand
up an elephant's ass

33:18.030 --> 33:20.297
was never part of the deal, no.

33:20.299 --> 33:21.465
On 3?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.668
Oh... No.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.504
Please, please, please, please.
Ok, what do you have?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.605
Evens. Ok.

33:28.607 --> 33:29.606
1, 2, 3...

33:30.609 --> 33:31.775
Oh.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.610
Heh heh heh heh.

33:35.481 --> 33:39.416
Doyle: Don't you move,
you big suitcase.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.622
Oh, that's horrible.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.593
You weird.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.463
Good thinking, poole.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.033
Well, come on, let's go.

33:56.035 --> 33:59.770
Let's get her on the plane
before this stuff kicks in.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.505
Come on, come on.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.040
Linh thought you joking.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.308
Bo-tat not get on plane.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.478
Excuse me?

34:09.481 --> 34:11.748
Bo-tat no like be on plane.

34:13.619 --> 34:14.751
How often does she fly?

34:14.753 --> 34:17.286
Bo-tat no like plane.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.755
The kid's right.
Let's get a truck.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.757
The plane is here.
We're taking the plane.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.492
Bo-tat no like plane.

34:22.494 --> 34:23.827
Kid... I'll handle it.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.429
Well, then handle it.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.264
Hurry up.
She goes down out here,

34:27.266 --> 34:28.532
you'll never get her inside.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.534
Linh... you nice American?

34:30.536 --> 34:32.402
You think you number one?

34:32.404 --> 34:35.572
You number 10.
You all number 10.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.739
Cahill!

34:45.317 --> 34:46.483
Bo-tat...

34:47.518 --> 34:49.753
that's the way. Come on.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.629
Heads up.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.264
You number 10.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.499
Tell her to lie down.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.733
What'd you do to Bo-tat?

35:03.735 --> 35:06.336
Tell her to lie down
so she doesn't hurt herself.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.761
Tko. Heh heh heh.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.365
What'd you do?

35:35.367 --> 35:37.634
She's ok, linh. She's not dead.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.270
You killed everything.
You killed everything.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.705
You killed Bo-tat.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.440
She's not dead.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.342
You killed Bo-tat.
You killed Bo-tat.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.811

You killed Bo-tat.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.779
You killed Bo-tat.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.450
Cahill: She's fine.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.321
She's just sleeping.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.360
¶ Your love ¶

you're gonna do

36:28.453 --> 36:29.653
when you get home?

36:29.655 --> 36:30.787
First thing?

36:30.789 --> 36:33.757
Hug my mom and
give her a big kiss.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.358
Second thing.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.628
Second thing?
Get her some kleenex.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.430
She gonna be bawling
her eyes out.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.581
So what about you, captain?

36:41.582 --> 36:42.731
What's waiting for you
back in the world?

36:42.734 --> 36:44.534
Uh...

36:46.438 --> 36:47.604
A hammer.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.607
My brother's
got a roofing company

36:50.609 --> 36:51.875
in fort lauderdale.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.778
Wants me to be a part
of that. Can't wait.

36:54.780 --> 37:00.350
Been dressed in green too long.
Time to get a real life.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.555
Ahh...

37:10.529 --> 37:12.662
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what are you kissing?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.364
What is that?

37:14.366 --> 37:16.666
Oh, it's nothing.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.501
Come on, what is it?

37:18.503 --> 37:20.537
It's stupid. It's, uh...

37:20.539 --> 37:22.639
When I first got to 'nam,

37:22.641 --> 37:25.875
I was in the main administration
building in da nang,

37:25.877 --> 37:30.447
feeling scared and...
Nervous like we all do

37:30.449 --> 37:32.349
and thinking about home.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.651
I was walking past
this coke machine,

37:34.653 --> 37:36.519
a bottle of coke
just dropped down,

37:36.521 --> 37:38.888
so...

37:38.890 --> 37:42.759
Drank that bottle of coke
and kept the cap for luck.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.362
So has it worked?

37:45.364 --> 37:47.564
Well, I don't really
believe in that stuff,

37:47.566 --> 37:49.633
but, you know...
2 years without a scratch.

37:49.635 --> 37:50.900
Who knows?

37:50.902 --> 37:51.901
I'll buy it.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.304
Nah, man, I couldn't.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.840
Come on, $20. I'll buy it.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.575
Keep your money, man. I...

37:58.577 --> 38:00.644
$40.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.880
Well, hell, if it means
that much to you, I mean...

38:03.882 --> 38:07.450
he just got it off the bottle
he's been drinking.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.655
Captain,

38:11.657 --> 38:13.890
major wants a word with you.

38:15.827 --> 38:19.362
Hey, farley, look at this
great big beautiful beast.

38:19.364 --> 38:21.364
How can you not like
something like that?

38:21.366 --> 38:22.365
Well, sir, I tell you...

38:22.367 --> 38:23.366
uhh... ow.

38:23.368 --> 38:25.635
Yeah?

38:25.637 --> 38:28.371
Yeah, we got a nasty headwind.

38:28.373 --> 38:31.474
Give baby the other
dose, captain.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.547
Poole,

38:37.549 --> 38:40.750
we have to give
the elephant the second pill...

38:40.752 --> 38:41.785
farley had a little run-in

38:41.787 --> 38:43.653
with the second pill, captain.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.728
Well, how much longer
will she stay out?

38:51.730 --> 38:53.230
Well, one of these
things is supposed

38:53.231 --> 38:54.731
to knock out a water
buffalo for 6 hours.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.366
And Bo-tat's about the size
of 3 water buffaloes...

38:56.368 --> 38:58.335
how much longer
do we have, poole?

38:58.337 --> 39:00.670
We got another hour, easy.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.673
Ok.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.555
I, uh...

39:18.557 --> 39:20.490
I was using the metric system.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.101
Tell me you did that.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.404
Uhh.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.109
Doyle: Whoa!

39:48.687 --> 39:50.687
It's awake!

39:50.689 --> 39:51.654
What was your first clue?

39:51.656 --> 39:52.889
Dump it.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.694
All: Whoa!

40:01.933 --> 40:03.500
Whoa!

40:04.770 --> 40:05.902
Bo-tat!

40:05.904 --> 40:07.871
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

40:16.581 --> 40:19.182
All: Whoa!

40:21.887 --> 40:24.187
Hey!

40:34.800 --> 40:37.700
Ashford: Aah!

40:41.706 --> 40:42.806
Doyle: Hey, hit the button!

40:42.808 --> 40:45.442
Hit the button!

40:48.647 --> 40:50.180
Get back there and shoot it!

40:50.182 --> 40:52.582
Shut it! We're gonna die!

41:07.566 --> 41:09.199
No!

41:10.469 --> 41:11.901
Hey!

41:24.216 --> 41:26.583
Uhh!

41:45.570 --> 41:47.604
Back in the pit, pilot boy.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.672
All right.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.954
Linh: Bo-tat! Bo-tat!

42:37.956 --> 42:42.592
Bo-tat! Bo-tat! Bo-tat!

42:47.198 --> 42:48.932
Hey! Hey!

42:48.934 --> 42:51.935
Hey! Hey!

42:51.937 --> 42:53.937
Wait! Wait a minute!

42:53.939 --> 42:55.305
You can't leave me here!

42:55.307 --> 42:57.140
Hey! Hey!

42:57.142 --> 42:59.809
I'm going to call lbj!

42:59.811 --> 43:02.278
I knew it! Uhh!

43:05.784 --> 43:07.951
Uhh!

43:11.723 --> 43:13.823
Guys?

43:13.825 --> 43:16.159
Guys? Wait up!

43:33.712 --> 43:35.778
Stop!

43:35.780 --> 43:37.146
No, no, no.

43:37.148 --> 43:38.781
Bo-tat scared! Bo-tat need me!

43:38.783 --> 43:40.717
Yeah, well, all I need is for
you to run off and get lost.

43:40.719 --> 43:41.851
Let me go!

43:41.853 --> 43:43.570
Cahill: Doyle, let him go.

43:43.571 --> 43:45.288
If I let him go, we might never
see him or the elephant again.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.623
Well, if you don't let him go,

43:46.624 --> 43:47.957
you'll never see Bo-tat again.
That's for sure.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.727
I'll go with him.

43:50.729 --> 43:52.929
All right.

43:52.931 --> 43:56.332
Farley: Come on.
Yep. There we go.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.904
Bo-tat understand American.

44:34.906 --> 44:36.339
Bo-tat,

44:36.341 --> 44:37.874
we're going to take you
to a beautiful land

44:37.876 --> 44:39.342
high in the mountains

44:39.344 --> 44:40.943
where you'll be
loved and respected.

44:40.945 --> 44:44.280
Where the air is cold and fresh

44:44.282 --> 44:46.716
and the water
is cool and sweet.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.918
It's the land where
you came from, Bo-tat.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.420
It's where you belong.

44:51.823 --> 44:53.990
Come with me.

45:57.989 --> 46:00.423
Doyle: We're about here,

46:00.425 --> 46:02.825
which means we're not
that far from tuy hoa,

46:02.827 --> 46:05.228
maybe about 10 Miles.

46:05.230 --> 46:09.232
We can get there tomorrow
and get ourselves a truck.

46:09.234 --> 46:13.770
An elephant on a truck for 150
Miles in the middle of a war.

46:13.772 --> 46:15.071
Piece of cake.

46:15.072 --> 46:16.371
Poole: Gilman, you know
those solid gold dog tags?

46:16.374 --> 46:18.074
They're yours.

46:18.075 --> 46:19.775
All you got to do
is get me out of here.

46:19.776 --> 46:21.476
Ah! Man, I just can't
spend the night in here.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.179
Just send... poole!

46:23.181 --> 46:24.447
Poole! Hang on a second...

46:24.449 --> 46:26.349
poole! Give me that!
What are you doing?

46:26.351 --> 46:27.550
Rustling up some
accommodations, captain.

46:27.552 --> 46:29.252
I can have beer and steak

46:29.253 --> 46:30.953
and... and padded cots here
in, like, half an hour.

46:30.955 --> 46:31.988
Maybe even some ice cream.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.356
And then, I figured,

46:33.358 --> 46:34.891
since you guys don't
really need me anymore,

46:34.893 --> 46:36.726
I could sort of head
back with the pilot.

46:36.727 --> 46:38.560
If all the enemy within 5 Miles
doesn't already know we're here,

46:38.563 --> 46:40.530
they sure as hell will
when a huey lands.

46:40.532 --> 46:42.865
Come on, give me a break, will you?
I got you the elephant.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.267
I'm supposed to be sitting in
the middle of a beach right now

46:44.269 --> 46:45.568
worried about my tan line,

46:45.570 --> 46:47.370
not out here in booneyville
worrying about snakes.

46:47.372 --> 46:48.938
Snakes? Snakes?

46:48.940 --> 46:50.907
You're right, poole.
You shouldn't be here.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.275
Give me the radio.

46:52.277 --> 46:53.876
I'll call general Richardson.

46:53.878 --> 46:56.445
I'm sure he can
get you reassigned.

46:58.383 --> 47:02.318
Break out rations, gentlemen.
This is home tonight.

47:04.556 --> 47:08.558
I'll bet you wish you had your lucky
bottle cap now, don't you, you smart ass?

47:24.475 --> 47:26.375
Linh: What are you doing?

47:28.346 --> 47:31.380
H.A. Is going home soon, linh.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.883
He wants good luck to make
sure he gets there safe.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.452
You want good luck?

47:36.454 --> 47:37.920
Don't tell me,

47:37.922 --> 47:39.488
you have an ancient
vietnamese bottle cap

47:39.490 --> 47:41.357
you're willing to sell me.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.260
Linh not sell anything.

47:44.262 --> 47:46.996
Here, elephant is good luck.

47:48.566 --> 47:52.468
You want good luck,
you touch Bo-tat.

47:53.571 --> 47:56.339
Yeah, right.

47:59.444 --> 48:00.977
So what's bad luck?

48:00.979 --> 48:03.646
Um, don't whistle in dark.

48:03.648 --> 48:05.548
Snake will come out
and bite you.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.583
Snakes?

48:07.585 --> 48:09.285
It get worse.

48:09.287 --> 48:10.453
Yeah?

48:10.455 --> 48:13.022
If you see owl at night,

48:13.024 --> 48:15.324
someone in your family die.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.460
Wow. So that's the worst?

48:17.462 --> 48:19.295
No. No?

48:19.297 --> 48:21.597
Owl nothing compared to crow.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.499
You see crow any time,

48:23.501 --> 48:25.935
that very, very bad luck.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.570
So what happens
when you see a crow?

48:27.572 --> 48:29.472
I tell you,

48:29.474 --> 48:31.641
if you see a big black bird,

48:31.643 --> 48:33.542
you run away.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.016
You know what?

48:40.018 --> 48:41.984
This country's
really beautiful.

48:41.986 --> 48:44.287
I mean, I am shocked.

48:44.289 --> 48:46.289
Yeah, it is great, isn't it?

48:46.291 --> 48:47.223
Kind of reminds me of home.

48:47.225 --> 48:48.357
Oh, yeah?

48:48.359 --> 48:49.592
They got a lot of rice paddies

48:49.594 --> 48:51.260
in cornpone, lowa,
do they, farley?

48:51.262 --> 48:52.662
Oh, no, that's Arkansas.

48:52.664 --> 48:54.363
I just meant... you meant what?

48:54.365 --> 48:55.698
Tell me exactly what you meant.

48:55.699 --> 48:57.032
Tell me exactly what
it is about this place

48:57.035 --> 48:58.267
that reminds you of home, huh?

48:58.269 --> 49:00.236
What is it?

49:00.238 --> 49:01.504
The spirit-crushing humidity?

49:01.506 --> 49:02.605
The disease-bearing insects?

49:02.607 --> 49:04.407
Or is it the special feeling

49:04.409 --> 49:06.242
that comes from the knowledge
that at any given moment,

49:06.244 --> 49:08.511
a sniper's bullet could come
spiraling towards your forehead?

49:08.513 --> 49:10.947
Is that it?

49:10.949 --> 49:13.983
Poole, I'm getting this weird
feeling you don't like it here.

49:13.985 --> 49:15.251
What's wrong with you?

49:15.253 --> 49:18.487
I love it. Everybody loves it.

49:18.489 --> 49:20.356
Bet you're the only
American in Vietnam

49:20.358 --> 49:22.024
who would rather
be someplace else.

49:22.026 --> 49:23.025
Enough.

49:31.402 --> 49:32.735
Hey! Hey, come on!

49:32.737 --> 49:34.603
Gimme... gi...

49:34.605 --> 49:37.239
ohh.

49:37.241 --> 49:39.041
Let's keep moving.

49:41.245 --> 49:43.379
Where are you going? Hey!

49:43.381 --> 49:45.414
They're going to help.

49:45.416 --> 49:49.251
For the love of... Cahill,
don't get me wrong.

49:49.253 --> 49:50.619
I would like nothing more

49:50.621 --> 49:52.555
than to skip through the
countryside doing good deeds,

49:52.557 --> 49:53.990
but we don't have the time.

49:53.992 --> 49:55.725
We have to get
a truck, remember?

49:55.727 --> 49:57.593
It won't take long.

49:57.595 --> 49:59.996
Besides, we might even
get something out of it.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.601
Maybe they'll
give you the stump.

50:07.305 --> 50:08.671
You go play good samaritan,

50:08.673 --> 50:12.675
I'm going to go to the
road and do our job, ok?

50:12.677 --> 50:16.012
Go. Go play. Go play.

50:38.736 --> 50:40.269
Bye, now.

50:40.271 --> 50:41.838
Doyle: Where is everyone?

50:41.839 --> 50:43.406
They'll be back in a minute.

50:44.776 --> 50:46.308
Big stump.

50:46.310 --> 50:48.411
America won something today,

50:48.413 --> 50:50.613
and we didn't even
have to shoot anyone.

50:50.615 --> 50:52.481
Oh, yeah?
Well, we lost 2 hours,

50:52.483 --> 50:54.817
and we still don't
have ourselves a truck, so...

50:54.819 --> 50:59.055
Yeah. How about an old diesel
with a 16-foot flatbed?

50:59.057 --> 51:00.097
You think that ought to do?

51:07.765 --> 51:11.333
One of our developing
agencies gave them a truck.

51:11.335 --> 51:12.768
But they rarely can afford gas,

51:12.770 --> 51:15.337
so they gave it to us for
pulling out the stump.

51:21.479 --> 51:24.413
¶ Hang on, sloopy ¶

51:24.415 --> 51:25.748
¶ sloopy, hang on ¶

51:34.325 --> 51:37.426
Forever. She belong father.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.495
Huh. What happened
to your father?

51:40.531 --> 51:42.832
He die.

51:42.834 --> 51:45.434
Well, how'd that happen?

51:47.538 --> 51:49.738
Do you think it was our side?

51:50.808 --> 51:52.508
I don't know.

51:54.612 --> 51:55.811
I hope not.

51:55.813 --> 51:57.813
¶ Hang on, sloopy ¶

52:36.554 --> 52:39.355
we got a leaky radiator.
I'll try to patch it.

52:49.534 --> 52:52.635
Poole, I speak the language.

52:52.637 --> 52:54.637
It's a joke.

52:54.639 --> 52:58.340
Any more joking,
I'll call you know who.

53:06.450 --> 53:08.284
Hey, stop!

53:08.286 --> 53:09.652
Bo-tat need move.

53:09.654 --> 53:11.420
Food.

53:11.422 --> 53:12.888
Water.

53:12.890 --> 53:14.790
She hungry.

53:14.792 --> 53:17.359
She thirsty.

53:17.361 --> 53:18.427
Now!

53:18.429 --> 53:19.895
All right. All right.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.533
All right, h.A., farley,

53:24.535 --> 53:25.801
take her down to
that fountain there

53:25.803 --> 53:27.403
and give her some water.

53:27.405 --> 53:29.605
We'll give her food
when we get it.

53:34.745 --> 53:37.746
Ah! Oh... Bo-tat!

53:37.748 --> 53:40.816
Jeez, what you
been eating, baby?

53:45.456 --> 53:47.356
One... one minute?

53:47.358 --> 53:48.457
Ashford: Drink up, Bo-tat,

53:48.459 --> 53:51.727
we don't want to
overstay our welcome.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.896
One moment?

54:08.646 --> 54:12.281
Hey, farley,
w-where's she goin'?

54:12.283 --> 54:14.350
Oh, no.

54:14.352 --> 54:15.351
Captain Doyle!

54:15.353 --> 54:16.652
Captain Cahill!

54:16.654 --> 54:17.753
Help.

54:26.797 --> 54:30.766
Linh: Bo-tat! Bo-tat!

54:30.768 --> 54:32.735
Bo-tat!

54:32.737 --> 54:34.470
Linh, stop that elephant!

54:34.472 --> 54:37.740
Ashford: Come back here!
Come back!

54:45.650 --> 54:47.883
Stop!

54:50.321 --> 54:51.654
Excuse me.
Watch out for the elephant!

54:51.656 --> 54:54.390
Aah!

54:56.560 --> 54:59.295
Whoa!

55:01.532 --> 55:02.798
Ashford: Is he all right?

55:02.800 --> 55:03.832
Farley: Oh, man!

55:03.834 --> 55:06.535
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

55:09.907 --> 55:11.674
Hey, um, sorry
about your chickens.

55:11.676 --> 55:14.543
Linh, we got to turn the
elephant back this way.

55:15.913 --> 55:17.546
We need to bring it back...

55:17.548 --> 55:19.548
we need to bring the
elephant back this way.

55:19.550 --> 55:22.318
Farley: Turn him around
and bring him...

55:22.320 --> 55:24.887
hey. Hey...

55:24.889 --> 55:26.455
whoa. Whoa... whoa!

55:26.457 --> 55:28.657
Farley: H.A.!

55:28.659 --> 55:30.859
Help!

55:30.861 --> 55:32.461
We gotta go this way!

56:04.662 --> 56:06.462
Let's go.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.399
Wait, we haven't
even done the...

56:13.804 --> 56:15.371
Oh, my God.

56:35.693 --> 56:36.825
Cahill: Let's go.

Whoa... unh!

57:47.698 --> 57:49.231
That doesn't sound very good.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.933
I know. We don't
have time to stop.

57:50.935 --> 57:53.202
If they weren't after us
before, they will be now.

57:53.204 --> 57:54.703
That guy at the feed depot

57:54.705 --> 57:55.704
wasn't the only n.V.A.

57:55.706 --> 57:57.573
They try to blend in.

57:57.575 --> 58:00.576
They all got
that same damn haircut.

58:16.694 --> 58:19.261
Cahill: Ohhh.

58:19.263 --> 58:22.164
Hey, w-where's he goin'?

58:22.166 --> 58:23.265
Doyle: Poole, where you going?

58:23.267 --> 58:24.500
Saigon.

58:24.502 --> 58:26.502
Get back here.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.170
Poole, do you want me to
call general Richardson?

58:28.172 --> 58:30.839
Yeah, Cahill. Yeah, I do.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.608
Ok? Call general Richardson.

58:32.610 --> 58:33.775
Let me get him on the
line here for you, ok?

58:33.777 --> 58:37.613
Because I am sick and tired...

58:37.615 --> 58:39.715
I...

58:41.218 --> 58:43.519
That's it. I've had it, ok?!

58:43.521 --> 58:45.054
Ok, I was on a plane
that almost crashed,

58:45.055 --> 58:46.588
I came this close to being
killed by an angry mob,

58:46.590 --> 58:48.624
and now... Look at my uniform.

58:48.626 --> 58:50.826
It's covered in elephant crap.

58:50.828 --> 58:53.529
So, if you think
that I really give a damn

58:53.531 --> 58:54.730
whether or not you call
general Richardson

58:54.732 --> 58:56.198
and tell him that I
slept with his wife...

58:56.200 --> 58:57.566
Doyle: Huh?

58:58.669 --> 59:00.802
Oh!

59:00.804 --> 59:02.571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:02.573 --> 59:04.573
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.392
You slept with the wife

59:06.393 --> 59:08.753
of general "kill 'em all and let
God sort it out" Richardson?

59:09.880 --> 59:11.280
I thought it was his daughter.

59:11.282 --> 59:13.215
Oh, yeah. He woulda
been fine with that.

59:16.620 --> 59:17.886
First off, poole,

59:17.888 --> 59:19.288
Saigon's the other way.

59:19.290 --> 59:22.724
Second, the nearest
town in any direction

59:22.726 --> 59:25.327
is hau bon, which is
30 Miles upstream.

59:25.329 --> 59:27.729
And third, the only
hope in hell you have

59:27.731 --> 59:29.898
of getting out of here
alive is to stay with us.

59:46.884 --> 59:47.916
Doyle: It's cooked.

59:53.223 --> 59:55.591
Ashford: What are we
gonna do, captain?

59:55.593 --> 59:57.326
We wait.

59:57.328 --> 01:00:00.729
Things come along
when you need 'em.

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:02.731
My motto's
"have a little faith."

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.834
Yeah, well, my motto is
"explosives and plenty of 'em."

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.606
Load the truck with all the
claymores and grenades we've got.

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:12.708
String one of the
claymore's trigger wires

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.727
to the door.

01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:16.745
N.V.A. Comes along, goes
to open the door, kaboom.

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:18.880
If we're lucky, it might
even take out the bridge.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.716
Lucky for who?

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:21.883
The people around here
use this bridge every day.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:23.885
That's enough already.
We're in a war here,

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:25.287
in case you don't remember.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.322
If you're right about the n.V.A.
Being after us,

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:28.557
they're gonna be
coming down that road

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:29.791
for one reason
and one reason only...

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.727
to kill us.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:34.396
Their lives
are my responsibility,

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:35.731
so excuse me if I don't
get all choked up

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:36.732
at the thought of disrupting

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:39.301
some local peasant's
daily commute.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.403
How do you know the n.V.A.'S
gonna be the first ones here?

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:42.971
What if it's
a bunch of school kids

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.406
who are goin' home?

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:46.875
You ever think about that? No!

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:49.277
Why? Because guys like you

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.846
don't think things through!

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:55.317
Me? What about you?!

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.953
You've got 5 people and an
elephant risking their lives

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.255
so you can go home
with a clear conscience.

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:02.290
You're afraid when
you're up on the roof

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.159
with your brother
in fort lauderdale

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.728
and you're lookin' back over
your sparkling military career,

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.397
you're not gonna like
what you see!

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:10.232
You're afraid
Vietnam's gonna wipe out

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.733
everything you did before,

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:13.869
so you want to do one
good thing before you go.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.737
Which is great.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:18.407
But your one good thing isn't pulling
a kid out of a burning building

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:20.909
or diving on a grenade.
It's <i> this!</i>

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:24.413
And because it's this,
it means it involves <i> us!</i>

01:01:24.415 --> 01:01:26.982
But you didn't think
about that, did you?!

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:28.350
No!

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.952
Why? Because guys like you

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:32.821
don't think things through!

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:51.873
Hey, come on, sirs,
break it up.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.742
Break it up, sirs.

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:54.976
Aah!

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.244
Oh, God! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.415
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.251
Gimme your hand. Pull him in!

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:08.757
You ok?

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:09.891
Whew!

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.861
Ok?

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:22.270
Yep...

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.939
I'm real happy
about my decision

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.173
to stick with you guys.

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:31.279
Uh, at the risk of
rekindling hostilities,

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:34.883
what do we do now?

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.986
Like I said,
have a little faith.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.419
¶ Ha ha ha ha ¶

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.530
Is that my ears,
or has your singing

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:22.931
actually gotten worse?

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:24.332
Must be your ears.

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:26.468
It was as bad
as it already could be!

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.471
Doyle: Have
a little faith, my eye.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.373
You knew this boat was coming.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.909
My first tour, I was
stationed at hau bon.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:35.477
Every Wednesday afternoon,

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.280
monsieur Goddard and the <i> Marie
antoinette</i> would drop in.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.448
He gave us
the best intelligence

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:43.318
on the location of the v.C.
We ever got.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.920
What... what can I say?
I love America.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.988
Yeah. Hey.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.960
You gave the v.C.
Their best intelligence

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.562
on our location, too.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:55.997
I can't help it, you know.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.365
I love everybody.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:58.533
Would anyone
like some wine here?

01:03:58.535 --> 01:03:59.835
Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.369
Wine?! No!

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.271
What is this, the opening
of an art gallery?!

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:04.873
No. This is a war.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.908
The green beret motto
is "free the oppressed,"

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.376
not "eat, drink, and be merry."

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:09.477
Yeah, now it is.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:11.379
Aww.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:14.382
What did I do? What did I do?!

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.251
I should be on some
high-priority mission

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.953
with a group
of crack commandos.

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:19.921
Instead, I'm in an episode
of <i> mchale's Navy,</i>

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:22.591
starring dumbo, Mr. French,
and the 3 stooges!

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:33.902
<i>D'ng lai.</i>

01:04:33.904 --> 01:04:35.237
That mean stop.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:37.406
<i>D'ng lai?</i>

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.574
<i>Dee.</i> That mean go.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.243
<i>Dee?</i>

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.578
You try.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.447
<i>Dee!</i>

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:48.917
Uh... d-d-d... uh... uh...

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:49.885
<i>D'ng lai!</i>

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:51.219
Good.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.921
You know 2 of 3
most important words

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:54.289
for elephant.

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.024
What's the third?

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.360
Huh?

01:04:58.362 --> 01:04:59.995
It means get off me.

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:03.331
Poole.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.502
Can you get more of that
water buffalo tranquilizer?

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.471
You really enjoyed that,
didn't you, Doyle?

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.909
Linh was right.

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:15.010
You are weird.

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:16.478
Poole.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.013
Poole: Yeah, yeah.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:18.980
As much as you want.

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:21.283
Ok.

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:23.351
We get off past
hau bon tonight.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.387
Tomorrow we take
one of these trails

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:26.454
which, God willing,

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:27.923
isn't in enemy hands,

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:28.957
over one of these ridges,

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:30.692
down into pleiku.

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:32.460
Friday morning we fly Bo-tat

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.462
to the airstrip
near the village.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.932
By noon we walk her in.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:37.933
Piece of cake.

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:43.305
Get down!

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:53.014
Doyle: Stay down!
Everyone stay down!

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.020
Farley. Hold your fire.

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:01.289
They're out of range.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.294
They're gonna have us
in 5 rounds.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.696
I know this. I'm artillery.

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:11.399
Give them a moving target.
Zigzag.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.409
Keep moving.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.693
Linh, what's wrong with Bo-tat?

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:40.562
She hurt here.

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:42.030
Oh, sh...

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.698
oh, no, she's seasick.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.403
Look out... she's gonna blow!

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:49.404
Eww!

01:06:58.248 --> 01:06:59.714
Years from now
my kid's gonna ask me,

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:02.317
"daddy, what's the worst
thing you saw in the war?"

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.752
After this, there's no contest.

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:14.396
Doyle: Can't you get this
tub to go any faster?!

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:18.333
You are going to sink my boat.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:21.603
Maybe not.

01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:28.476
Gilman, who would
I actually know

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:29.611
that could get me
your head in a bag?

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:30.745
It was a joke, pal.

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:33.048
Yeah, I was kidding.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:35.050
I love you, man.
Like a brother.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.618
What are you, nuts?!

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.470
Where am I gonna find
a triumph spitfire

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.321
in the middle of Vietnam,
you rotten little rat?!

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:42.323
Ok, ok, I'm sorry. I apologize.

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:46.061
Ok. All right, you got it.

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:47.695
Just patch me through to
firebase cheo reo now, ok?

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:49.064
And direct to artillery.

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:50.598
I don't have time
for channels or anything.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.634
Ok. He's puttin' me through.

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:55.503
Son of a... heh heh.
Right here. Hang on.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.274
Uh... Yeah...

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:00.775
We're on the song ba river

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.344
being pursued
by n.V.A. In a boat.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.613
What? Yeah,
this is hotel Alpha.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.515
Who's this? Barney?

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:08.850
Hey, Barney, what's up, man?
What you doin'...

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:10.385
h.A.! H.A.! I'm sorry.

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:13.321
Uh, cheo reo, we
need your help pronto.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:15.423
Request fire mission
and expedite.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.791
Call for battery fire
at grid coordinates

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:20.428
bravo Romeo 354...1105 niner.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.830
Fire one marking round.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.640
Barney, that was perfect, man!

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:35.510
No, it wasn't perfect.
It almost hit us!

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.462
Give 'em other coordinates.

01:08:37.462 --> 01:08:39.412
Captain, we're moving. Those
coordinates are gonna be perfect.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.648
Right about... Better be right.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:41.783
Fire for effect!

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:43.718
Better be right. Now.

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:58.633
Ha! Whoo! Whoa!

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.834
Yeah!

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:01.870
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
start callin' you

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:03.638
the brown bomber!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.439
Brown bomber.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:32.367
You wanna try it on?

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:52.287
I found a place where
we can spend the night.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:30.792
Farley: Hey, sir,
what is this place?

01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:33.661
An ancient temple.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.463
Buddhist?

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:38.533
Actually, it's tam giao.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:42.904
A little buddhism, a little
confucianism, and a little tao.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.654
What's with all the elephants?

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.425
The elephant
is the God in tam giao.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:06.894
Not a God.

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:09.330
<i>Father</i> of God.

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:14.535
In beginning,
elephant were white,

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:17.805
and they fly in the air with
the clouds and the rain.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:25.413
One day, elephant fly down and
go into side of queen Maya...

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:28.650
While she sleep and dream.

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:31.386
She have baby.

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:35.290
Prince siddhartha,
the gautama Buddha.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:38.459
Elephant, father of God.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:11.092
Linh, that story
you told was great.

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.860
I... I loved the bit
about the flying elephants.

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.730
Uh, just one thing, though.

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.832
It might be better if you
started, "in the beginning,

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.667
all elephants were black."

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:22.670
All right, this
is our only option.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:26.541
We have to take this trail
over this pass into pleiku.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:28.576
Is the pass secure?

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:30.845
Tch. I don't know.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.680
We could find out
at this village

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.682
unless you think 5
Americans and an elephant

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.818
waltzing into town might
arouse suspicion.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.586
Hmm. Not at all.

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:39.921
We could send in linh.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:41.422
No one would suspect him.

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:42.590
No, we can't do that.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.691
Why not?

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:44.692
You know why.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.494
We can't take that chance.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:55.737
I got it. Wait.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.168
Doesn't matter to me
who killed your family.

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.704
I imagine it doesn't
matter to you, either.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:35.476
V.C. Killed
mother and sister...

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:39.414
But linh not know
who killed father.

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:40.548
Linh and father going home...

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:45.153
There was big light.

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:47.588
Everything happened fast.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:52.693
People yell, shoot gun.
Father hold linh tight.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:54.128
Bo-tat run.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.930
They shoot Bo-tat.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.135
Father and linh land apart.

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:04.705
Father get up, run
to linh, and fall down.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:07.909
He shot.

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:09.877
Linh not move.

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:11.913
Bo-tat save linh.

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:14.582
Men shoot Bo-tat more times.

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:18.486
Bo-tat no stop for many Miles.

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:23.191
Bo-tat save me.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.916
Were you hurt?

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.253
You said you couldn't move.

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:55.790
No, I said I not move
because I too scared.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:58.226
Father die because I not help him.
I scared.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:14:59.760
No, no, linh, that's not why.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:01.696
Yes, I scared!

01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:02.763
Of course you were scared.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:05.700
I'd be scared.
Anyone would be scared.

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.902
Linh.

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:08.836
It wasn't your fault.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:10.771
Who fault?

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:11.939
People.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:17.211
People far away, linh.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:21.182
People who've never been here.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.218
Linh no understand.

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:34.929
How did you get to ban don?

01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:36.797
American take linh.

01:15:36.799 --> 01:15:39.667
Said take linh back
to mountains someday.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:42.837
Never did. Lie to linh.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:47.208
I'm gonna take you
back to the mountains, linh.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.712
I promise you.

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:08.629
Linh father was a good father.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.731
Number one father.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.867
I'm sure he was.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.581
I'm sure he was.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:17.398
Yeah.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:42.356
Oh, man, I just went
to go take a whiz.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.226
I didn't want to
desecrate the temple.

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:46.861
Forget about it. It's done.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.896
He probably went to get
some food or something.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.898
Whatever the reason, they're gonna
find out we're here pretty damn soon.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.199
He's just a kid.

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:53.868
I know. I have to go get him.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.337
I'll get the elephant to pleiku
and we'll meet you there.

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.972
Excuse me, guys, <i>una momento.</i>

01:17:57.974 --> 01:17:59.974
But how are we gonna
move old Bo here, huh?

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.976
Linh taught farley
the basic commands.

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:03.878
No, he didn't.

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:06.414
Ok, sir, he did, but...

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:09.884
Take someone with you.

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.719
I screwed up. I'll go.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:27.902
Th-that's funny. My... my
legs don't work.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:30.971
Poole: Ah, hell. I'll go.

01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:34.975
Kid's got my watch.

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:18.986
Ok, do the foot. Get... get her
to do the foot and get up.

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:20.287
Let's go.

01:19:20.289 --> 01:19:21.288
Come on.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.356
I don't... I don't know that one.

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:23.808
All right, can you
guys give me hand?

01:19:23.809 --> 01:19:25.259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here' take the gun.
Take the gun.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.461
Put your foot on my leg.

01:19:27.463 --> 01:19:29.363
Ok. One... do you wanna jump in?

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:32.933
On 3, h.A., 1...2...3.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:37.471
Ok, I'm up. I'm up.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:39.306
Good job. Good job.

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:40.541
I don't know about this, sir.

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:44.378
I guess that means she's ready.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.013
I think she's mad.
Doyle: Come on.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:54.321
This way. Take us
around the village.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.191
Farley, this way!

01:19:57.193 --> 01:19:58.359
He didn't teach me how to turn.

01:19:58.361 --> 01:19:59.927
Then stop her!

01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:01.328
Ok, ok. Uh... Dee!

01:20:03.348 --> 01:20:05.365
I mean... I mean,
Dee d'ng. D'ng. Dai!

01:20:05.368 --> 01:20:06.433
Farley!

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.868
Uh!

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:08.969
Tell my mom I love her!

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.479
Stop!

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:54.014
Stop, darn it,
you crazy animal!

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:04.225
Ohh!

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.935
Whoa! Aah!

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.337
Bo-tat?

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:21.475
Farley, you wild a driver.

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:22.543
Ha ha.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:31.585
Sam!

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:32.653
You all right?

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:34.021
Yeah. Huh?

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:44.498
They worked him over
pretty good.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.967
He hit me this many.

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:52.373
So, when I tell him you
in hau bon, he believe.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.341
You told him
we were in hau bon?

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:05.319
Kid, why did you come here?

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:08.289
You want to find out
if trail ok...

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:11.325
But linh is the only one
who can ask.

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:15.396
Before linh caught,
linh find out trail ok.

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:17.031
You trust linh now?

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.367
Yeah.

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:25.472
I trust linh now.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:38.452
You guys do this hug a lot.

01:22:41.324 --> 01:22:43.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:22:43.025 --> 01:22:44.491
Bo-tat!

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:46.293
No!

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:47.594
Yee-hoo!

01:23:13.622 --> 01:23:16.690
¶ Aow! Walk that walk ¶

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:19.560
¶ come on, talk that talk ¶

01:23:20.596 --> 01:23:23.597
¶ come on, tell me, baby ¶

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:26.700
¶ come on, tell me
that you love me... ¶

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.003
canceled?

01:23:30.773 --> 01:23:33.007
What do you mean
the mission is canceled?

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:35.042
Turns out Doyle was right.

01:23:35.044 --> 01:23:36.410
We don't need the village.

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:42.416
While you two
were off on safari,

01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:44.485
the ho chi minh trail
moved again,

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:47.021
and intelligence estimates are
it's gonna stay where it is.

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:49.056
The village is of
no strategic interest.

01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:51.759
"No further
strategic interest"?

01:23:51.761 --> 01:23:56.630
Major pederson, sir,
we're so close.

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:58.499
Let us finish what we started.

01:23:58.501 --> 01:24:00.401
We just have to fly
the elephant to...

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:01.568
to where, Cahill?!

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.738
To that old CIA airstrip
near the village?

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.474
The n.V.A. Blew the heck
out of it 3 days ago.

01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:09.410
You have no place to
land your elephant.

01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:11.045
The airstrip's gone.

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:12.579
End of mission!

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:14.415
What about linh and Bo-tat?

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:17.384
Who?

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.319
The boy and the elephant, sir.

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:21.622
Well, you ship them back to
where you picked them up.

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:33.700
Where are you going?

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:34.835
I can't tell you.

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:36.336
Ashford: Why not?

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:37.337
'Cause if I tell you,

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:38.539
you'll try to stop me.

01:24:38.541 --> 01:24:39.807
If you don't try to stop me,

01:24:39.809 --> 01:24:41.075
you'll be court-martialed.

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:42.643
The mission's been canceled.

01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:44.745
I have a feeling the
captain's gonna ignore that.

01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:48.782
What are you gonna do, steal
a truck from the motor pool?

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:49.716
If that's what it takes.

01:24:49.718 --> 01:24:51.618
Oh, hell!

01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:54.321
If we're gonna steal a truck,

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:56.356
we might as well steal a plane.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.626
What?

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:01.428
You worried because
there's no airstrip?

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.530
We don't need one.

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:05.599
Remember when
we first went to pederson

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.434
and I said,
"let's get them a tractor"?

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.769
What if we had?

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.437
How would we have
gotten a tractor in?

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.807
Tractors don't need airstrips.

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:16.276
Poole.

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:17.744
Yeah?

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:20.414
Ok, we're gonna
need parachutes...

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:21.882
we?

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:23.784
Poole: Yeah, captain.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.853
We.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.689
H.A., farley, are you in?

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.626
Yeah.

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:35.395
Ok.

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:38.265
You take one step toward dak
nhe with that elephant,

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:41.435
you can kiss your sweet
military career good-bye.

01:25:43.606 --> 01:25:46.640
Yeah, well,
maybe we all need to do

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.442
one good thing before we go.

01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:22.776
E-easy now, easy.

01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:52.773
Hey!

01:26:52.775 --> 01:26:54.308
Shh!

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.521
This is insane.
Bo-tat's not a tractor.

01:27:41.523 --> 01:27:43.757
Poole, did we just hear
a heartfelt human emotion

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:45.359
come out of you?

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:48.462
Yeah, it was.
I feel bad for her.

01:27:48.464 --> 01:27:49.664
Don't tell anybody I said that,

01:27:49.665 --> 01:27:51.365
ok, you guys?

01:27:51.367 --> 01:27:53.734
It's top secret, ok?

01:27:53.736 --> 01:27:55.435
So top secret, we're not
even getting clearance

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:56.470
from the tower.
Radio's silenced

01:27:56.472 --> 01:27:58.505
and nobody knows anything.

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:00.539
As a matter of fact,
this never happened.

01:28:10.586 --> 01:28:11.885
Sir, they've stolen
a 123 out of pleiku.

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:13.353
When?

01:28:13.355 --> 01:28:13.854
About 5 minutes ago, sir.

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:15.756
Damn it!

01:28:15.758 --> 01:28:17.758
Get on the radio
and tell 'em to get back.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.726
That whole area is jammed
with n.V.A. Anti-aircraft.

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:21.428
Yes, sir.

01:28:40.549 --> 01:28:42.382
Cahill: Don't
be nervous, poole.

01:28:42.384 --> 01:28:44.384
I just never
have jumped before.

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:46.820
Well, neither has she.
Does <i> she</i> look nervous?

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.490
All right, listen up.

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:54.094
Bo-tat and the crate
are on a static line.

01:28:54.096 --> 01:28:56.430
Now, the drogue will trigger
the parachute to open

01:28:56.432 --> 01:28:58.365
the second
she's out of the plane.

01:28:58.367 --> 01:29:01.535
Now, you three are gonna
jump before Bo-tat.

01:29:01.537 --> 01:29:04.671
Free fall for a count
of 10, and then pull.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:07.107
Ok? Got it?

01:29:08.544 --> 01:29:09.810
We want to make sure
you don't get tangled

01:29:09.812 --> 01:29:11.745
in Bo-tat's lines going down.

01:29:11.747 --> 01:29:12.913
And we want you to be clear

01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:15.682
of our large friend
before she lands.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.684
Now, captain Cahill and I
are gonna stay on board

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:19.419
until Bo-tat gets off.

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:22.389
Once she's off,
we're gonna go, ok?

01:29:22.391 --> 01:29:23.423
Sam: Any questions?

01:29:23.425 --> 01:29:24.791
Linh get one?

01:29:24.793 --> 01:29:26.393
Well, no, linh.

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:27.694
You have to stay on the plane.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.364
Well, maybe he...
linh could take mine,

01:29:30.366 --> 01:29:32.132
and, uh, I could, um,
stay on the plane. I mean...

01:29:32.134 --> 01:29:34.568
but linh go with Bo-tat.

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:35.836
I'm sorry, linh.
It's too dangerous.

01:29:35.838 --> 01:29:37.537
You can't.

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:40.640
You promised you take linh
and Bo-tat home to Mountain.

01:29:40.642 --> 01:29:42.476
You will go home.

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.544
You'll see Bo-tat
in a day or 2.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:45.912
But first you have to
go back to the base

01:29:45.914 --> 01:29:47.381
with the pilot. There's no...

01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:50.417
you lie! You lie!

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:54.554
Hey.

01:29:57.493 --> 01:29:59.159
Hey, you're right.

01:30:00.496 --> 01:30:01.695
I did say I'll get you home,

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:03.497
and I will.

01:30:03.499 --> 01:30:06.166
I'll stay with you
on the plane.

01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:11.471
I'll get you to the mountains.

01:30:11.473 --> 01:30:13.407
I'll get you back to Bo-tat.

01:30:14.443 --> 01:30:16.943
You just can't go with her now.

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:21.181
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:28.789
Here comes another one!

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.193
Oh!

01:30:34.563 --> 01:30:35.929
Take us down below the radar.

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:36.830
Pilot: This isn't a fighter.
This is a cargo plane.

01:30:36.832 --> 01:30:38.165
Do it!

01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:45.605
Aah! Aah!

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.595
You can't drop
from this altitude.

01:31:08.597 --> 01:31:11.131
We'll go back up when we
get closer to the village.

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.799
Doyle: No, now.

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:14.801
Do it now! Now!

01:31:27.216 --> 01:31:28.715
Doyle: Ah, jeez!

01:31:28.717 --> 01:31:30.484
Looks like we're all
gonna be jumping.

01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:31.518
Can you get us in
over the village?

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.854
One pass, then we bail.

01:31:34.957 --> 01:31:36.256
We're going now!

01:31:36.258 --> 01:31:37.724
Get ready.

01:32:16.632 --> 01:32:18.231
Change of plans, linh.

01:32:18.233 --> 01:32:19.866
Pilot: We're coming in
on the village!

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:21.268
I'll be right down.

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:30.310
Stand by!

01:32:33.582 --> 01:32:34.581
Ready?

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:35.582
Yeah. Ok.

01:32:35.584 --> 01:32:37.717
Go! Go! Go!

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:39.853
I... I can't go, guys. I... I
left something back inside.

01:32:39.855 --> 01:32:41.321
I gotta... I can't do this.

01:32:41.323 --> 01:32:42.856
I'm an office guy, man.
I work in an office

01:32:42.858 --> 01:32:45.225
behind a desk!

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:51.731
Ashford: Isn't
this great, chief?

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.733
It's moving!

01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:57.270
Farley: Isn't this fun, poole?

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:21.595
No! Bo-tat!

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:35.842
Hold on tight!

01:33:38.747 --> 01:33:40.981
Linh: Aah!

01:33:52.628 --> 01:33:54.728
Sam: Hold on!

01:33:57.633 --> 01:33:59.933
Aah! Aah!

01:34:03.405 --> 01:34:05.739
Aah!

01:34:07.342 --> 01:34:08.908
Get it! Go!

01:34:20.922 --> 01:34:23.323
Hold on, Bo-tat. Hold on.

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:24.658
I'll get you.

01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:45.278
Oh!

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:06.766
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:35:06.768 --> 01:35:07.767
Whoo!

01:35:07.769 --> 01:35:08.768
Yeah!

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:09.736
Thank God!

01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:28.848
Poole: Please, God,
get me through this.

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:30.950
I'll never lie again.
Please. Uhh. Oh!

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:33.920
Hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo.

01:36:33.922 --> 01:36:35.355
Farley: Whoo!

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.894
Farley, you're dead.
Swear to God.

01:36:40.896 --> 01:36:43.296
I'm gonna kill you.

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:44.931
Ashford: Oh, my God.

01:36:44.933 --> 01:36:46.833
Oh, my God.

01:36:46.835 --> 01:36:47.901
Whoa! Whoa!

01:36:47.903 --> 01:36:49.936
Aah! Aah!

01:36:51.273 --> 01:36:53.339
Linh like hug. Hug good.

01:37:11.593 --> 01:37:13.560
Sam: Be careful. Be careful.

01:37:13.562 --> 01:37:16.896
Keep everybody back.
All right. Very good.

01:37:32.581 --> 01:37:34.380
Is she ok?

01:37:34.382 --> 01:37:37.317
Everything number one a-ok!

01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:42.488
Hey, where's h.A.?

01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:44.924
Get me a ladder!

01:37:47.929 --> 01:37:49.596
Doyle: Back her up, linh!

01:37:49.598 --> 01:37:51.865
Come on, sweetheart. We gotta
get you ready for the ceremony.

01:37:51.867 --> 01:37:53.399
Good girl.

01:37:55.337 --> 01:37:56.369
Uh-oh.

01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:02.909
Unh!

01:38:04.312 --> 01:38:05.578
Drop your weapons!

01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:18.458
You bring elephant very far.

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.959
Very admirable.

01:38:19.961 --> 01:38:21.494
I congratulate you.

01:38:21.496 --> 01:38:25.598
Too bad you go
to all this trouble

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.267
for nothing.

01:38:29.938 --> 01:38:31.237
Bird, if I were you,

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:32.572
I'd get the hell out of here.

01:38:34.042 --> 01:38:35.475
Elephant going to die.

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.979
Drop your guns! Drop your guns!

01:38:39.981 --> 01:38:41.347
Drop... drop 'em!

01:39:35.003 --> 01:39:37.737
Roger, whiskey tango. Over.

01:39:37.739 --> 01:39:40.239
Crossbow 6 out.

01:39:41.576 --> 01:39:43.576
What did he say?

01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:46.512
Well, the good news
is that capturing nguyen

01:39:46.514 --> 01:39:48.381
and his men
has made you a hero.

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:51.317
And the bad?

01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:52.585
Recon photos are indicating

01:39:52.587 --> 01:39:55.288
that the trail has moved
back this way again.

01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:58.324
Pederson wants you to stay.

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:03.329
That is bad news.

01:40:20.415 --> 01:40:23.249
I have to go now, linh.

01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:25.351
You not like it here.

01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:28.421
I love it here.

01:40:28.423 --> 01:40:33.593
I love this place more than
any place I've ever been.

01:40:33.595 --> 01:40:35.728
You not like linh.

01:40:37.432 --> 01:40:39.399
You know that's not true.

01:40:39.401 --> 01:40:41.501
Then why you go?

01:40:45.407 --> 01:40:49.742
Just like you had
to go where you belong,

01:40:49.744 --> 01:40:52.378
I have to go where I belong.

01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:21.074
You forget linh?

01:41:24.779 --> 01:41:27.380
When I forget how to breathe.

01:41:43.832 --> 01:41:45.431
Take her easy, linh.

01:41:46.534 --> 01:41:47.533
Safe trip home.

01:41:47.535 --> 01:41:49.635
Oh, thank you. Good luck.

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:52.338
Thank you.

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.639
Hey, hope to be
in special forces, too,

01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:54.640
one day, sir.

01:41:54.642 --> 01:41:55.775
Thanks. Good job, soldier.

01:41:55.777 --> 01:41:57.610
Thanks.

01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:59.378
Captain.

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.646
Ever need anything...

01:42:00.648 --> 01:42:01.781
Ok.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.652
Yeah.

01:42:23.805 --> 01:42:26.305
Doyle: Sam.

01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:27.607
When you're standing on a roof

01:42:27.609 --> 01:42:29.542
with your brother
in fort lauderdale...

01:42:31.379 --> 01:42:33.446
I think you're
gonna like the view.

01:43:02.443 --> 01:43:04.343
You watch Bo-tat?

01:43:05.313 --> 01:43:07.880
Yeah. I'll watch Bo-tat.

01:43:07.882 --> 01:43:09.348
Have fun.

01:43:19.561 --> 01:43:21.627
Cliff Edwards: The horsefly.

01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:24.730
I seen a dragonfly.
I seen a housefly.

01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:28.734
Cliff Edwards: See,
I seen all that, too.

01:43:28.736 --> 01:43:32.371
¶ I seen a peanut stand,
and heard a rubber band ¶

01:43:32.373 --> 01:43:35.508

that winked its eye ¶

01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:39.312

01:43:43.318 --> 01:43:44.550
Jim Carmichael: With the wind.
