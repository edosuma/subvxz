WEBVTT

00:45.915 --> 00:47.003
Monet.

00:48.657 --> 00:49.745
Monet!

00:50.615 --> 00:51.703
Hey.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.097
Can you watch these boxes

00:54.271 --> 00:55.359
while I get
the other ones up?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.232
What if someone
tries to take something?

00:58.797 --> 01:00.495
You just ask them
politely to freeze,

01:00.669 --> 01:02.323
while you're sketching
for the police.

01:18.469 --> 01:19.992
Can you help your mama out,
please?

01:20.645 --> 01:22.125
Mom, I'm painting.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.388
Is that how you gonna be
the man of the house?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.435
Mom, why can't you have
more sons,

01:27.609 --> 01:29.393
so we can take turns
being the man?

01:29.567 --> 01:30.960
It's exhausting.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.616
Yeah, I'm exhausted already.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.662
I wish
you don't ever have to grow up

01:37.836 --> 01:38.837
to be a man in this world.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.883
Especially a Black man.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.803
Sorry, babe, let me just
put that there for a sec.

01:51.676 --> 01:52.982
Are these my toys?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.027
Hey, be careful.
Those are fragile, okay?

01:58.248 --> 02:00.076
-Monet!

02:03.993 --> 02:06.300
Jesus, not this one.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.305
Sorry.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.656
You know, your dad got this
for me as a wedding gift.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.617
If you look
on the bright side,

02:19.791 --> 02:22.054
now it's gonna remind you more
of Dad when you look at it.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.929
Your tongue
is a good enough reminder.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.461
Mom, why everything
looks different here?

02:38.114 --> 02:39.159
What do you mean, baby?

02:40.116 --> 02:42.292
The homes,
the people, the streets.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.729
Everything is much brighter.
It's not like back home.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.471
Yeah, it's different, but...

02:48.559 --> 02:49.908
you'll have
a brighter future.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.085
And you'll go
to a different school

02:53.260 --> 02:55.740
and see brighter looking kids.

02:56.872 --> 02:57.916
Do you know what?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.528
I bet you shine brighter
than all of them.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.405
What if they don't like me,
'cause we don't look alike?

03:09.232 --> 03:11.191
Hey,
what do I always tell you?

03:13.758 --> 03:17.109
You can only see
the true color of a diamond

03:17.284 --> 03:18.415
through a shining light.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.635
There's a...

03:20.809 --> 03:22.332
There's a rainbow
in everyone

03:22.506 --> 03:24.856
if we just look beyond
our deceiving sight.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.206
Right.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.818
All right,
let me see your masterpiece.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.473
I think
that girl across the street

03:32.647 --> 03:33.909
could see my rainbow.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.705
Stay here.
I'll be right back, okay?

03:48.663 --> 03:50.099
I'm scared of cops.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.536
Baby, hey.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.321
They smell fear, remember?

03:55.626 --> 03:57.149
What you gonna be,
a lion or a lamb?

03:57.846 --> 03:58.890
A lion.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.544
That's my boy.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.372
I'll be right back.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.254
Hey, officer.

04:14.863 --> 04:15.951
Everything okay?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.735
Are these your items?

04:17.909 --> 04:20.129
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I just moved here.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.479
Anything wrong, officer...

04:23.306 --> 04:24.394
Clinton?

04:25.134 --> 04:27.267
Well, you know,
you're blocking the public path.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.529
May I check your ID?

04:37.015 --> 04:38.147
It's my hair.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.541
I-- I used to
straighten it back then.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.413
You know,
my mom used to say

04:43.587 --> 04:46.242
a Black woman should never ever
straighten her hair.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.200
You ever see a lion
playing with its mane?

04:48.375 --> 04:50.899
Ma'am, ma'am.
Please, step aside.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.597
I need to check
the content of the boxes.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.382
May I ask why?

04:55.947 --> 04:57.340
We've had
a few concerning calls

04:57.514 --> 04:58.602
from neighbors.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.169
I'm just doing my job.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.436
What a warm welcome.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.268
Hey, can you just
be a little more gentle?

05:12.442 --> 05:13.574
That's my son's toys.

05:14.879 --> 05:17.142
-How old is your son?
-Nine.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.278
Isn't he too young
to be around guns?

05:22.452 --> 05:24.106
Leave my toys alone!

05:25.542 --> 05:26.543
Monet, stop!

05:27.588 --> 05:28.937
Hey,
what are you doing?

05:29.111 --> 05:30.330
Hey, stop!

05:31.635 --> 05:33.594
Don't you fucking
point your gun at my son.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.726
This is how
you're raising your child?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.293
Leave my mom alone!

05:38.076 --> 05:40.035
Hey, it's--
it's just a game.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.645
Okay?
We're just playing a game.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.735
So, she's not a real cop?

05:45.475 --> 05:46.520
No.

05:47.782 --> 05:48.826
Certainly not.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.451
Look at you growing
all big and tall.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.243
All right.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.208
Hey,
can you stop that please?

07:06.904 --> 07:09.080
-But it's fun.
-Yeah, well, not for me.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.739
Okay, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.005
Do me a favor.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.095
Okay.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.707
Can you show me
where this color is?

07:26.881 --> 07:28.360
I don't know.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.406
Okay, look, we know
that the card says what?

07:30.885 --> 07:32.190
Green?

07:32.364 --> 07:33.409
Right, so,
if the label's green,

07:33.583 --> 07:35.150
take this and match it

07:35.324 --> 07:37.108
with something else
in this apartment.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.898
Mmm.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.204
Close.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.254
I can't tell.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.474
Try again.
Try a little harder.

07:56.911 --> 07:57.955
Mmm...

08:02.351 --> 08:03.439
Okay.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.660
-I can't tell.
-Okay.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.750
What do we know
for sure is green?

08:11.229 --> 08:13.449
-The tree.
-That's right.

08:17.758 --> 08:18.802
Careful.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.287
Good one!

08:26.418 --> 08:27.811
- Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.599
Okay, what else?

08:33.774 --> 08:35.602
I don't know.
Give me a clue.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.002
Is the sky always blue?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.918
-Not always.
-Mom, look at the sun.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.312
Hey, don't look up there
too long, okay?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.836
I like how bright it is.

08:53.010 --> 08:53.924
Yeah, but, Monet,
you're gonna go blind

08:54.098 --> 08:55.535
if you stare too long.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.058
I'm already blind.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.929
Monet, you're not blind.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.452
Says the blind.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.108
Monet, we're colorblind.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.023
Well, that's still blind.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.198
-Monet, I don't want to hear it.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.722
Stop. Please.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.029
Okay, listen, there are people
that can see color,

09:12.203 --> 09:13.988
but that doesn't make them
any different than we are.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.339
People label colors
just like we do.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.907
They just do it
in their minds.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.650
But, look, we got
a better imagination, right?

09:24.738 --> 09:25.782
Mmm.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.788
What colors
do you see in the sky?

09:33.529 --> 09:35.966
I see pink and red.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.882
Like a giant pomegranate.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.363
Like a giant pomegranate.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.061
Where'd you get
all that imagination?

09:44.235 --> 09:46.150
Can we eat
pomegranates tonight?

09:46.324 --> 09:47.891
Baby, I don't think

09:48.065 --> 09:49.327
there are enough pomegranates
on this planet

09:49.501 --> 09:51.242
to satisfy your appetite.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.202
We haven't had any
since we moved here.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.205
All right, all right,

09:57.379 --> 09:59.294
um, when we're done
furnishing the apartment,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.731
I'll run out and grab
some pomegranates, okay?

10:02.776 --> 10:04.081
Can you come
help me with this map?

10:07.955 --> 10:08.999
Grab that side.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.268
Did you know that
where we originally come from,

10:17.442 --> 10:19.270
there's tons of
pomegranate trees?

10:19.444 --> 10:20.532
Can we move back?

10:21.533 --> 10:23.448
Maybe. One day.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.994
Yes? Can I help you?

10:47.168 --> 10:49.170
Hi, Mr. Walton.
Sorry to bother you.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.302
How do you know my name?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.174
I'm the new tenant
downstairs.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.392
New tenant?

10:54.871 --> 10:56.699
Yes, I'm Magdalene.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.396
The rental management told me
just to pay you directly--

10:58.570 --> 10:59.876
Hold on, there must be
some kind of mistake.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.052
I'm expecting
a Magdalene Whyte.

11:02.574 --> 11:03.532
Yeah, that's me.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.665
W-H-Y-T-E.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.581
I know it's weird
seeing a Black person

11:09.756 --> 11:10.931
with a white last name,

11:11.105 --> 11:13.455
like, literally Whyte.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.849
Huh, strange.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.328
But management informed me

11:17.502 --> 11:18.939
that an old white woman
was here

11:19.113 --> 11:21.028
looking for an apartment
for her daughter.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.421
Yes, that was my mom,
she was helping me out.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.858
She used to live
around this area.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.555
Your mom?

11:27.599 --> 11:28.688
Is this
some kind of a joke?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.083
All right, let me explain
before you think I'm crazy.

11:33.257 --> 11:36.130
So, I was adopted
by a white woman.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.784
She couldn't have
any kids of her own,

11:37.958 --> 11:39.220
so, she raised me...

11:40.177 --> 11:41.439
and she gave me

11:41.613 --> 11:43.093
the good Catholic name,
Magdalene,

11:43.267 --> 11:44.442
and, of course,
I took her last name

11:44.616 --> 11:46.444
and so here we are.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.707
Huh.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.449
Believe me, if I could pick
a Black family, I would,

11:51.623 --> 11:53.887
for everyone's convenience
and clarity.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.111
Right, uh, so,

12:01.285 --> 12:04.636
here is this month's rent
and deposit.

12:06.682 --> 12:07.639
-Thanks.
-Wait, wait.

12:07.814 --> 12:08.902
I want to count it first.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.600
Make sure you didn't give me
more than I asked for.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.128
We good?

12:21.349 --> 12:22.872
We good?

12:23.046 --> 12:25.527
Um, there was a boy
in the application.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.442
That's my son, Monet.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.097
-Monet?
-Mm-hmm.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.751
I named him
after my favorite artist.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.929
French impressionist artist?

12:36.407 --> 12:38.148
Was going blind
through his career,

12:38.322 --> 12:40.150
but still painted anyway?

12:40.324 --> 12:41.630
-No?
-No. Don't know.

12:41.804 --> 12:42.849
Mm-hmm.

12:43.719 --> 12:44.764
Where's the father?

12:46.330 --> 12:47.636
He's not with us.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.551
Oh.

12:50.378 --> 12:54.077
So, you have a man
or someone to look after?

12:56.906 --> 12:59.779
Look, um, are we good?
Can I go?

13:00.257 --> 13:01.693
-So I can--
-Yeah, I, uh.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.695
-I'll just get your receipt.
-Thanks.

13:08.135 --> 13:09.223
Got a nice place.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.529
Could use some color, though.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.793
I'd love to give you
one of my paintings.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.056
I hate colors.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.797
Of course.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.018
-You paint, huh?
-Yup.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.672
Professionally?

13:24.194 --> 13:25.239
Yeah, that's why I moved here.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.806
I got an invitation

13:26.980 --> 13:27.894
from the city's
Contemporary Art Gallery

13:28.068 --> 13:29.939
and I hope to use that

13:30.113 --> 13:32.072
to help pay
for my son's education.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.682
Hmm.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.423
You know,
the gallery's closed, yeah?

13:36.641 --> 13:39.035
Look, you'll get your money
on time, okay?

13:39.775 --> 13:41.690
Well, I'm gonna need
last month's rent.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.301
What do you mean?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.390
Well,
you said you paint, right?

13:47.217 --> 13:48.653
So?

13:49.176 --> 13:51.874
I'm gonna need last month's rent
in case something happens.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.964
In case what happens?

13:56.052 --> 13:57.837
Look.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.361
I'm a retired firefighter.
I assess risk for a living.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.493
Given this current situation,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.060
it seems highly unlikely

14:04.234 --> 14:05.366
to be able
to keep up with the rent.

14:06.541 --> 14:09.239
And, uh, your damage deposit
won't be enough

14:09.413 --> 14:11.894
to clean the cheap paint
off my expensive furniture.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.157
I'm sorry, cheap paint?

14:14.331 --> 14:15.985
Yeah.
My apartment, my rules.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.596
You're lucky
I accepted your application.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.860
-Unknowingly.
-Still.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.471
A lot of landlords
in this neighborhood

14:23.645 --> 14:25.865
wouldn't be so open-minded.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.606
Well, thank you
for your open-mindedness,

14:28.780 --> 14:30.870
but I don't have
that kind of money for you.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.656
I mean, there must be some
kind of renters' protection,

14:34.830 --> 14:36.092
or some human rights.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.921
Look, you do
what you have to do...

14:40.314 --> 14:43.447
but I'm a firefighter
and you don't play with fire.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.591
Uh, bet you don't have
colored neighbor problems

15:40.765 --> 15:42.202
where you are, Mr. Jackson.

15:50.862 --> 15:51.951
All right.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.604
-Sorry.
-Asthma, huh?

16:37.300 --> 16:38.649
Damn.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.608
I think I heard
this is a good brand.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.305
Yeah, it gets worse
in the winter.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.572
Uh, you know what?
I-- I'll take that another time.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.619
Okay, well...

16:52.228 --> 16:54.491
I think I'm gonna need one
of these inhalers my damn self.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.015
-Excuse me?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.495
Well, girl...

16:59.453 --> 17:00.584
you so fine...

17:01.368 --> 17:03.370
...you're taking
my breath away.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.676
Oh, Lord. All right.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.374
I bet you say that
to all the ladies

17:07.548 --> 17:09.289
-that come in here.
-Oh, no, no, no.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.421
Just to a fine sister like you
with a sense of humor.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.425
See, I can't be myself
around these other folks.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.601
-If you know what I mean.
-Yeah.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.169
The name's Benyah.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.085
You new here, right?

17:23.564 --> 17:25.870
Yeah. Magdalene.
Just moved in.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.438
With my son, actually.
These are all for him.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.179
-He must love pomegranates.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.138
Oh, he's obsessed with them.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.273
Jesus, $25?

17:37.447 --> 17:38.970
What is this?
Some forbidden fruit?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.450
-Uh.
-It's not even red.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.148
Well...

17:43.758 --> 17:44.933
let me tell you a secret.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.196
You see,

17:47.370 --> 17:49.720
I call these
diaspora pomegranates.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.767
Taken from their native land.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.247
Trying to blend
into their new home

17:54.421 --> 17:56.858
for over 400 years.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.687
But don't be deceived
by their exterior...

18:00.427 --> 18:01.819
because deep down,

18:01.993 --> 18:03.082
they haven't forgotten
who they are,

18:03.256 --> 18:04.518
their true colors.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.087
They know who they are
and where they come from.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.307
Do you?

18:15.224 --> 18:17.270
That one's coming
out of your pocket, Benyah.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.793
Oh, yeah, don't worry
about that, Alvin,

18:18.967 --> 18:20.621
I'll put all these
on my-- on my tab.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.710
-Oh, no, I can't allow that.
-Yes, you can.

18:22.884 --> 18:26.105
Just consider it
a welcome gift.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.456
Okay. Thanks.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.724
Wow.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.208
You okay?

18:44.732 --> 18:47.256
Ooh, okay, okay, okay.
Don't drip it.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.954
-You'll spill everywhere.
-So good.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.130
Did you do your homework?

18:53.001 --> 18:54.350
No homework,
it's winter break.

18:54.872 --> 18:58.180
Okay, school is closed,
but education is not.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.530
You don't stop learning
just 'cause they tell you to.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.533
But I want to
be a painter like you.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.622
Oh, baby.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.929
This world is too cruel
to artists.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.931
Plus, I want to make sure
you get an education

19:10.105 --> 19:11.454
that I wasn't able to have,
okay?

19:11.628 --> 19:12.890
So that
when the opportunities come,

19:13.064 --> 19:14.153
you just catch it.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.956
Let me show you
what I learned today.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.392
You see this pomegranate?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.664
See all the seeds
stick together?

19:49.057 --> 19:50.363
That's how
we gotta stick together.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.105
You know, sometimes life,

19:54.280 --> 19:55.498
it's gonna be tough on you.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.198
It's going to squeeze you...

20:00.068 --> 20:03.767
pressure you
to every last drop exactly.

20:06.770 --> 20:07.815
But...

20:09.730 --> 20:10.774
even then...

20:12.472 --> 20:13.516
we stay together.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.257
Like a pomegranate.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.610
-Like a pomegranate.
-Mm-hmm, lock it in.

20:21.872 --> 20:25.615
-Like a pomegranate seed, baby.
-Like a pomegranate.

20:28.749 --> 20:29.880
All right, here you go.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.406
-To our new home.
-And my new friends.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.624
-Cheers.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.023
Oh. Oh!

20:42.197 --> 20:44.286
Excuse me.
Where did you learn that from?

20:46.070 --> 20:47.289
I've seen how you drink.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.858
Wait, so you're telling me
I'm raising a little spy?

20:52.294 --> 20:53.600
What else have you seen?

20:58.648 --> 21:02.870
Oh, wow. Okay.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.915
Just gonna embarrass me
like that, huh?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.743
Okay, great.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.876
Go to your room.
Go to your room.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.486
-You're on punishment.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.096
Ten days.
No video games, no nothing.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.576
What're you doing?

22:05.454 --> 22:07.326
Oh, did that hurt?

22:44.537 --> 22:45.973
Hey!

22:46.147 --> 22:47.627
Turn down that jungle music!

22:49.890 --> 22:51.239
Turn down that jungle music!

23:01.684 --> 23:02.816
Anyways, you ready to eat?

23:03.817 --> 23:05.645
Okay, there you go, baby.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.651
Uh, hi, hello?
Did you forget something?

23:14.784 --> 23:16.307
What would your Dad do
if he was here?

23:16.482 --> 23:18.440
I don't know.
I wasn't born yet.

23:18.614 --> 23:22.183
I wasn't born yet.
He would say his prayers first.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.750
Come on.
Get to do grace.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.713
Ah! Colorblind, not blind.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.630
Go ahead.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.242
Dear Lord.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.983
Thank you for
the colorful dish

23:40.157 --> 23:42.943
and helping us see things
as you created them.

23:43.378 --> 23:45.685
Excuse me, I hope
you're not mocking God.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.384
Okay.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.255
You know what?
Hold on.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.823
-Yeah.
-No.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.564
You're not gonna--
you're not gonna eat yet.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.436
You need to do
a good deed today first.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.176
But why?

24:00.569 --> 24:01.788
-But why?
-I'm hungry?

24:01.962 --> 24:03.398
Oh, you're hungry?

24:03.572 --> 24:05.008
And you haven't did
your deed either.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.315
Uh, I'm sorry,
who's the mom, me or you?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.883
-You.
-Yeah.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.362
What does the Lord
say about neighbors?

24:12.494 --> 24:13.800
Avoid your neighbors.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.454
Monet.

24:19.283 --> 24:21.547
-Love your neighbors.
-Very good.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.636
So...

24:24.550 --> 24:28.031
I want you to take this up
to the landlord, okay?

24:28.205 --> 24:30.251
And make sure you politely
introduce yourself,

24:30.425 --> 24:31.470
you understand?

24:34.124 --> 24:35.386
But why?

24:38.520 --> 24:39.826
Because...

24:42.219 --> 24:43.612
a good deed
goes a long way.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.572
No, because
you didn't pay enough rent.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.225
What? Hey.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.794
I overheard you.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.710
Hey, uh, first of all,
you shouldn't do that

24:54.884 --> 24:56.277
and I did pay, and...

24:57.365 --> 24:59.628
listen, it's not about
paying rent, okay?

25:00.324 --> 25:01.543
It's about paying respect.

25:03.763 --> 25:06.287
Sometimes people need kindness
more than they need money.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.421
Oh, wait, but one thing,

25:10.596 --> 25:12.162
don't tell him about
your color blindness, okay?

25:12.336 --> 25:13.424
But why?

25:14.513 --> 25:16.036
Because we don't know him.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.777
And sometimes people
like to take advantage

25:17.951 --> 25:19.169
of the disadvantaged people.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.910
-All right?
- Mm-hmm.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.390
You don't want to show
anyone your weakness.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.088
Remember when your friends
made fun of you at school?

25:25.262 --> 25:26.568
When they found out?

25:27.221 --> 25:28.309
-Yeah.
- All right.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.571
Go ahead.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.748
Uh, you know what?
Hold on a sec. Come here.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.275
Uh, yeah.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.364
There you go.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.236
It's a symbol
of peace, okay?

25:42.932 --> 25:43.977
Right in there.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.638
Black Lives Matter.

25:52.812 --> 25:55.597
Well, I say all lives matter

25:55.771 --> 25:57.120
and to protect our lives

25:57.294 --> 26:00.080
in this chaotic country
that we live in,

26:00.254 --> 26:04.998
uh, I'm asking you
as a retired firefighter

26:05.172 --> 26:07.653
to, uh--
oh, no, no, no, no wait.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.350
We need law and order.
That's it.

26:09.524 --> 26:12.222
Law and order
and as a retired firefighter,

26:12.396 --> 26:13.789
I'm asking you people

26:13.963 --> 26:16.618
to extinguish
the destructive flames

26:16.792 --> 26:19.403
of thugs and criminals
in our streets.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.843
Oh, for crying out loud.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.807
-Yes?
-Hi, I'm Monet.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.942
Hello. What do you want?

26:36.116 --> 26:38.509
My Mom asked me
to bring this dish to you,

26:38.684 --> 26:40.120
but don't eat
the flower though,

26:40.294 --> 26:43.427
that's just the symbol
of peace, I guess.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.255
Yeah, well,
that's very nice of your Mom,

26:45.429 --> 26:46.692
but I'd rather be
alone in peace.

26:46.866 --> 26:47.910
Thank you very much.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.610
You can eat alone in peace.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.483
Here.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.399
Okay, tell you what.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.619
You stay here.
I'll be back with the plate.

27:04.492 --> 27:07.147
Holy moly,
was that ever good!

27:07.321 --> 27:10.063
Oh, delicious!
Man, oh, man.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.074
There you go.
All in one go, all done.

27:21.248 --> 27:22.292
Delicious.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.903
That was fast.

27:25.121 --> 27:28.211
Yeah, well, you tell your Mom,
thanks very much,

27:28.385 --> 27:30.649
but, uh, I'd rather see
the overdue rent

27:30.823 --> 27:31.911
on a plate next time.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.742
She said sometimes people need
kindness more than money.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.701
Is that so?

27:40.746 --> 27:41.790
You wait here.

27:45.054 --> 27:48.231
I'll give you
a symbol of peace.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.847
Peace out.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.779
How'd it go?

28:23.049 --> 28:24.137
Why did he give you these?

28:24.877 --> 28:27.357
As a symbol of peace,
I guess.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.759
Did-- did I do
something wrong?

28:38.281 --> 28:40.283
No, baby, you didn't.
No. Listen.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.765
I don't ever want you
talking to that man again.

28:43.939 --> 28:44.984
You understand?

28:50.163 --> 28:52.078
But you said kindness
goes a long way.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.296
Yeah, I was wrong.

28:54.254 --> 28:55.821
He's a giant

28:55.995 --> 28:57.648
and giants
have the smallest hearts.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.303
Come here.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.140
Come here.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.928
Okay.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.409
Hold still, hold still.
Don't move, don't move.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.415
Voila!

29:25.589 --> 29:26.852
Now, you just gotta keep it on
for ten minutes, okay?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.115
Can I keep it on longer?

29:29.289 --> 29:30.594
No, baby, no, you can't.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.470
Do bright people
have bright colors?

29:39.473 --> 29:40.735
What?

29:41.214 --> 29:42.737
My friend Abby
used to tell me that.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.047
Let me show you something.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.791
I want you to think about...

29:53.748 --> 29:55.097
how much you love me.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.577
Really feel it, okay?

29:58.971 --> 30:00.015
Okay.

30:02.148 --> 30:05.064
Now, still feel
the same love for me?

30:08.241 --> 30:09.285
Okay, good.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.853
How about...

30:15.901 --> 30:16.902
now?

30:18.207 --> 30:19.556
Still feel
the same love for me?

30:22.777 --> 30:23.865
Okay, see?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.955
Doesn't matter
how you look on the outside.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.263
If someone has love
in their heart for you

30:30.437 --> 30:31.481
or hate...

30:32.613 --> 30:33.875
the outside doesn't change.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.703
On the inside...

30:36.573 --> 30:37.574
you still feel the same.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.402
You understand?

30:40.360 --> 30:41.578
Yep.

30:46.670 --> 30:47.976
Why do we have
to look different?

30:49.021 --> 30:51.675
Hmm, well...

30:54.026 --> 30:55.941
Look, you think
these masks look different,

30:56.115 --> 30:57.159
but they're not.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.597
They have the same essence,

31:00.771 --> 31:02.948
just different colors.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.647
Listen.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.215
What's really important...

31:10.390 --> 31:11.826
and the most
important thing is...

31:13.697 --> 31:15.003
having fun.

31:19.747 --> 31:22.271
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

31:26.362 --> 31:29.104
You know, Shelby,
we gotta get you a mate.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.933
Yeah.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.980
No, me. Me?

31:35.589 --> 31:36.982
I'm not alone.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.548
I don't--
I don't need anyone.

31:38.722 --> 31:39.941
You worry about yourself.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.683
Yeah.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.120
Yeah.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.081
You know, she would have made
a great mother, you know.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.213
Look at that. Yeah.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.216
And you would have made
a great babysitter.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.180
Here you go. Good boy.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.979
Are you going
to your new gallery tomorrow?

32:18.719 --> 32:22.027
-Uh, yes, but not for long.
-Can I come?

32:22.201 --> 32:23.637
No, baby,
children aren't allowed.

32:23.811 --> 32:25.856
But you said
I wasn't a child anymore.

32:26.031 --> 32:29.034
I said you need to stop
acting like a child.

32:31.732 --> 32:35.866
I am technically
the man of this house.

32:36.041 --> 32:40.001
Hmm, well, technically
you'll still be my child

32:40.175 --> 32:43.613
even when you have great peach
fuzz growing on your booty.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.225
-That's gross!

32:54.102 --> 32:56.626
Mom, I wish I'd met Dad.
What was he like?

32:58.063 --> 32:59.760
Well, he was...

33:00.761 --> 33:02.023
very cute...

33:03.851 --> 33:05.548
and curious.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.333
Just like you.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.687
Okay!

33:18.866 --> 33:21.173
Mom, what happens
when people die?

33:23.566 --> 33:24.828
Let me
show you something.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.049
So over here.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.356
There are just lights...

33:31.574 --> 33:33.837
and then you cross over
to the other side...

33:35.013 --> 33:36.927
they become a rainbow.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.105
See that?

33:45.893 --> 33:48.461
Your Daddy could be up there
in all those colors.

33:50.289 --> 33:51.942
All right, it's time for bed.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.902
- Good night, Mom.
-Thank you.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.830
Now let's find
my babies a new home.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.315
Now, which one?

34:24.714 --> 34:28.109
Just freezing
my ass off all day.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.812
Not
the best time to sell.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.814
Yeah, tell me about it,

34:37.988 --> 34:39.033
I've been here all day
and nothing.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.992
This would be a lot easier
if it was in my gallery.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.211
Your gallery?

34:43.994 --> 34:45.648
Yeah, that's--
that's why I moved here.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.608
These pieces are supposed
to be in my exhibition

34:48.782 --> 34:51.045
for the, uh,
Contemporary Art Gallery.

34:51.219 --> 34:52.916
Oh,
you mean the MOCA Gallery?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.744
Yes. You know it?

34:54.918 --> 34:57.530
Everyone knows it,
it's very prestigious.

34:57.704 --> 35:00.010
It's too sad
they had to close down.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.403
Well, you know what?

35:02.012 --> 35:04.450
Art must go on, right?

35:06.887 --> 35:08.671
You know what? I would love
to give you a discount

35:08.845 --> 35:10.586
since you're
my first customer here.

35:11.674 --> 35:12.675
Well, let me see.

35:15.765 --> 35:16.810
Hey, guys.

35:18.681 --> 35:21.554
How much for the yellow
and green one right there?

35:21.728 --> 35:22.816
Uh...

35:23.773 --> 35:24.861
yellow and green.

35:27.951 --> 35:30.128
Um...

35:30.302 --> 35:32.042
Uh, this one?

35:32.217 --> 35:33.653
No, the--
no, the one

35:33.827 --> 35:35.916
that's mainly yellow
with the green line,

35:36.090 --> 35:37.309
right-- right there,
over there.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.880
Do you mind pointing out
which one exactly you wanted?

35:44.446 --> 35:46.274
Are you sure they're yours?

35:46.448 --> 35:48.102
Oh, yeah, they're mine.
I-- I painted them.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.150
I-- I don't want
to get in any trouble.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.977
What-- what trouble?
There's no trouble.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.545
I painted them, they're mine.
I-- I'm colorblind.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.593
Oh, come on!

36:04.901 --> 36:06.120
Of course. Thank you.

36:11.343 --> 36:15.216
I started as a surrealist,
but after today?

36:16.261 --> 36:20.047
Yeah, that rain turned me
into an impressionist.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.745
To my new mentor,

36:22.919 --> 36:24.007
the rain.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.578
Mom, I need to pee.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.232
Baby, let me spend
a little more time

36:31.406 --> 36:32.451
in this surreal reality

36:32.625 --> 36:34.061
before you drag me back.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.458
I need to pee!

36:43.462 --> 36:45.377
Okay, it's open.
Come in.

36:50.033 --> 36:52.035
Some privacy, please.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.950
Boy, ain't nobody
looking at you.

36:55.691 --> 36:56.997
Hey, and lift up the lid.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.739
You said you weren't looking!

36:59.913 --> 37:02.176
I-- I have ears,
so I can hear.

37:05.527 --> 37:06.659
What are you still doing up?

37:08.051 --> 37:09.270
I had a nightmare.

37:11.272 --> 37:14.101
Oh, come here,
tell me what happened.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.323
You know what you were?

37:19.193 --> 37:20.238
So colorful.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.763
Wait. You dream in colors?

37:27.288 --> 37:28.637
That's weird.

37:29.812 --> 37:31.423
What happened?

37:31.597 --> 37:33.468
You were laid down
still without breathing,

37:33.642 --> 37:35.427
so calm and so silent,

37:35.601 --> 37:39.344
then slowly a huge rainbow
coming out of your mouth.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.520
Okay.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.044
A rainbow?

37:44.740 --> 37:45.785
Out of my mouth?

37:48.309 --> 37:49.441
You really dreaming in colors?

37:50.180 --> 37:51.921
Yeah, I swear to Dad.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.968
Okay. Okay, all right.

37:55.621 --> 37:56.665
I believe you.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.628
I don't think
I can go back to sleep.

38:03.498 --> 38:04.847
Oh, okay, baby.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.545
Go back to bed.

38:06.719 --> 38:07.894
I'm gonna come in there
in just a minute, okay?

38:08.068 --> 38:09.156
Okay.

38:12.638 --> 38:15.118
My baby's seeing colors.

38:17.860 --> 38:18.905
Okay.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.743
What should I name this one?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.009
Oh, good Lord.

38:37.445 --> 38:38.577
Yikes.

38:46.672 --> 38:47.803
Gosh.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.330
Okay, how's it going
over here, baby?

38:54.375 --> 38:56.508
It doesn't look as happy.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.205
Yeah,
I told you not to pick it.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.207
Flowers are never as happy

39:00.381 --> 39:01.426
when they're separated
from the soil.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.125
What do we do?

39:05.299 --> 39:06.387
Um...

39:07.301 --> 39:09.303
why don't we take it outside,
on the patio?

39:09.477 --> 39:10.957
Get some sunlight.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.351
Wait, wait hold on.
I'll give you your coat.

39:15.265 --> 39:16.354
Here.

39:33.675 --> 39:34.720
Good morning.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.725
-Nice flag.
-What's that?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.596
Nice flag.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.382
-I have the same one, see?

39:44.556 --> 39:45.600
Oh, yeah.

39:45.774 --> 39:46.906
It's not the same thing, Monet.

39:47.472 --> 39:48.908
It looks the same.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.257
It's not the same,
it's a different color.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.215
But it looks the same.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.347
But it's a different color
with different meeting, okay?

39:53.521 --> 39:55.044
It looks the same.

39:55.218 --> 39:56.655
All right,
but it's different.

39:56.829 --> 39:57.438
Come on, let's just
keep fixing this.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.269
Excuse me,
do you mind putting that out?

40:02.443 --> 40:03.879
What's that?

40:04.227 --> 40:05.490
I have asthma, so you mind
while we're out here

40:05.664 --> 40:06.926
if you could
just put that out?

40:07.622 --> 40:09.972
Hey, I'm just sitting up here
having a smoke on my side.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.280
Keep your smoke
to your side then.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.369
Hey, talk to the wind, kid.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.589
Monet, let's go.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.331
When are you gonna pay the rent?

40:22.681 --> 40:25.553
-Talk to the wind, giant!
- Monet!

40:25.727 --> 40:27.425
Sorry about that. Soon.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.775
Monet, careful,
careful, careful,

40:29.949 --> 40:30.950
you'll get your shirt dirty.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.168
I just washed that.

40:46.661 --> 40:47.923
Hey, guys. How can help you?

40:49.011 --> 40:50.056
How much is this one?

40:51.144 --> 40:53.233
You know what?
I can give that to you for 550.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.456
510, we got a deal.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.155
Yeah, okay. Sure.

41:07.290 --> 41:08.378
Thanks.

41:09.031 --> 41:10.076
You only got hundreds?

41:11.773 --> 41:12.818
You have enough change?

41:13.601 --> 41:15.385
You know what, these days,
all I got is change.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.604
Let me check.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.481
Okay.

41:24.220 --> 41:27.746
20, 40, 90.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.617
Here you go.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.489
I'd take that other one
if you can make the same deal.

41:33.099 --> 41:34.187
You-- you want one too?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.233
Okay, yeah, sure.

41:38.017 --> 41:39.584
Where do you
get this money from?

41:42.804 --> 41:44.589
Rich neighborhood, dude,
rich kids.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.157
You sell on the street,
you gotta have mutual trust.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.986
Yeah, yeah, of course.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.511
One sec. Thanks.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.995
There you go.

42:01.083 --> 42:04.086
Thanks.
Hey, thank you guys so much.

42:04.652 --> 42:06.524
Thank you.
You know what?

42:06.698 --> 42:08.395
Hey, when the gallery opens,
I'll invite you out,

42:08.569 --> 42:10.049
and you can appreciate those
on the wall.

42:18.057 --> 42:20.276
'Cause what?
I'm an artist, duh!

42:20.929 --> 42:24.150
All right,
let's pack this up, okay.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.245
Girl, you sold
those paintings,

42:32.419 --> 42:35.553
you sure did sell
those paintings.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.518
You're kidding me.

44:08.254 --> 44:10.996
Shit.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.258
Oh, shit.

44:12.867 --> 44:14.521
Okay, wait, wait, my inhaler.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.132
My inhaler, God.

44:17.916 --> 44:19.395
Oh, fuck, okay.

44:19.569 --> 44:21.702
Okay, okay, it's okay.

44:48.163 --> 44:49.861
-What do you want?
-Where's your mom?

44:50.035 --> 44:51.601
She left
to go get something.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.168
Yeah. She what?

44:53.342 --> 44:54.648
She left to go get
some pomegranates.

44:54.822 --> 44:56.128
You mean at the grocery store?

44:56.911 --> 44:58.391
Well, how long ago
did she leave?

44:59.174 --> 45:00.393
Just a few minutes ago.

45:01.263 --> 45:02.308
Right.

45:02.961 --> 45:04.310
Do you want
some pomegranates too?

45:04.527 --> 45:06.660
No, I don't want
any goddamn pomegranates.

45:19.499 --> 45:21.501
Yeah, hi, yeah.
This is Walton Gray.

45:21.675 --> 45:23.024
I'd just like
to report a fraud.

45:24.069 --> 45:26.680
Yeah, my-- my new tenant
just tried to pay the rent

45:26.854 --> 45:27.986
with counterfeit money.

45:29.465 --> 45:31.511
Well, the colors were off,
I'm not fucking blind.

45:32.468 --> 45:34.122
Sorry. Sorry.

45:35.297 --> 45:36.690
No...

45:40.738 --> 45:42.217
What does
she look like again?

45:43.436 --> 45:45.655
Bushy brown hair,

45:45.830 --> 45:47.919
uh, she was wearing
a white jacket.

45:48.571 --> 45:50.704
- Black, White?
- Black.

45:50.878 --> 45:55.230
-Uh, about 5'7, 5'8.
- All right.

45:56.492 --> 45:59.147
That's her, officer.
That's her right there!

45:59.321 --> 46:00.540
It's okay,
thank you, thank you.

46:01.062 --> 46:02.020
-Hi, there.

46:02.194 --> 46:03.673
Just stay right there,

46:03.848 --> 46:05.240
don't move,
I just want to talk to you.

46:05.414 --> 46:06.676
I-- I just want to
ask you a few questions.

46:06.851 --> 46:08.113
Just don't move.
Stay right there.

46:08.287 --> 46:09.897
Stay right there,
no, no, no!

46:10.071 --> 46:11.725
-I didn't do anything wrong!
- No, no!

46:11.899 --> 46:12.639
-I-- I said stop, don't move!

46:12.813 --> 46:14.815
Gotcha! Gotcha!

46:16.469 --> 46:17.383
Face down,
don't move--

46:17.557 --> 46:18.776
What the hell is that?

46:22.997 --> 46:24.999
A little extra tight,
just for you, huh?

46:28.960 --> 46:30.962
Suspect
is a Black woman in her 30s.

46:31.136 --> 46:33.616
Average build, under arrest
for disobeying the order.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.708
Get off of me, I can't breathe.

46:38.883 --> 46:40.754
Oh, stop
with that cliché bullshit.

46:40.928 --> 46:42.277
I'm nowhere near your neck.

46:45.411 --> 46:48.196
-I didn't do anything wrong.
- No? No?

46:48.370 --> 46:49.850
Then why the hell
did you run away from me?

46:50.024 --> 46:52.026
-Why'd you run?
- I was scared.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.942
Stop resisting or I will
taze you again, you hear me?

46:55.508 --> 46:56.726
And fuck your pomegranate.

47:04.343 --> 47:06.867
Okay, all right,
let me see something.

47:07.041 --> 47:08.086
Hold on.

47:09.348 --> 47:11.741
What's your name, huh?
Magdalene Whyte.

47:11.916 --> 47:14.048
What do you do for a living,
Magdalene?

47:16.398 --> 47:18.096
-I'm a painter.
- Oh, you paint?

47:18.270 --> 47:19.837
Are you an artist,
or a con artist?

47:20.011 --> 47:21.055
What?

47:23.579 --> 47:25.277
Look familiar to you?

47:25.451 --> 47:26.800
You buy a lot of things
with these counterfeit bills?

47:27.670 --> 47:29.455
Counterfeit money?
What are you talking about?

47:30.195 --> 47:32.545
Those boys, they gave it to me.

47:35.156 --> 47:37.898
Yeah, I've got her.
I'm heading there right now.

47:38.072 --> 47:39.073
What's the address?

47:41.597 --> 47:43.948
Well, apparently,
it's not the first time

47:44.122 --> 47:46.167
you've been using
these counterfeit bills, huh?

47:46.341 --> 47:47.560
What?

47:47.734 --> 47:49.214
You are in big trouble, sister.

47:49.388 --> 47:50.911
-Get up! I said get up!

47:51.085 --> 47:52.130
Come on.

47:54.219 --> 47:56.438
I hate this ghetto shit,

47:56.612 --> 47:59.311
and I fucking hate
pomegranates.

48:00.573 --> 48:01.704
Come on.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.532
Counterfeit money, huh?

48:03.706 --> 48:05.360
I swear,
I don't know, I didn't know!

48:05.534 --> 48:06.753
Oh, you do,
or you couldn't tell why?

48:06.927 --> 48:07.972
What, you blind or something?

48:10.061 --> 48:12.106
What is it?
Say it, spit it out. Come on.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.368
I'm colorblind.

48:14.587 --> 48:16.284
You're a colorblind artist

48:16.458 --> 48:18.634
who paints, do you think
I'm stupid or something?

48:20.419 --> 48:22.203
Get them away.
There's nothing to see here.

48:22.377 --> 48:23.813
There's nothing to see.
Back off.

48:23.988 --> 48:24.945
I said back off!

48:28.340 --> 48:29.384
Now, listen to me.

48:31.604 --> 48:33.475
I'm going to gather
the rest of the evidence,

48:33.649 --> 48:35.390
and you better come up
with a better excuse

48:35.564 --> 48:36.783
by the time I get back here.

48:39.177 --> 48:40.787
Fuck off, man,
let her go.

48:40.961 --> 48:41.962
- Come on, who are you?

48:42.702 --> 48:43.790
You okay?

50:21.670 --> 50:24.630
Now, she's claiming
to be an artist of some kind.

50:24.804 --> 50:27.111
-A painter. Any truth to that?
-Yeah, yeah.

50:27.285 --> 50:29.678
Uh, she's probably
made a big mess

50:29.852 --> 50:30.897
of my apartment already.

50:32.420 --> 50:35.032
Look, officer,
how can I get my money back?

50:35.641 --> 50:37.425
We'll deal with that
soon enough.

50:37.599 --> 50:39.166
Now, do you know anything
about her being colorblind?

50:39.340 --> 50:40.689
Colorblind?

50:40.863 --> 50:42.517
Well,
think about it, officer.

50:42.691 --> 50:43.997
She makes her living
as a painter for Christ's sakes.

50:44.737 --> 50:46.260
I wouldn't believe
anything she says.

50:47.305 --> 50:49.611
In fact, I think
her ID's all fake.

50:49.785 --> 50:51.309
You gonna run a check on it?

50:51.787 --> 50:53.746
-I'm asking the questions here.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

50:54.747 --> 50:56.836
Now, you see people coming
in and out of her apartment?

50:57.010 --> 50:58.751
Maybe she's got
others helping her?

50:58.925 --> 51:00.274
Does she live alone?

51:00.448 --> 51:02.102
No, no, she has a son
living with her.

51:02.276 --> 51:04.104
He told me that she's gone
down to the store.

51:04.800 --> 51:05.888
And where is he?

51:06.454 --> 51:07.542
Just down below us.

51:08.326 --> 51:10.632
-How old is he?
-I don't know, eight or nine.

51:10.806 --> 51:12.025
It's hard to tell
with that black skin.

51:12.199 --> 51:13.244
Can't see too clearly.

51:14.723 --> 51:15.768
Right.

51:16.551 --> 51:19.554
-Can you show me?
-Yeah, yeah, it's, uh...

51:20.729 --> 51:21.817
just right down there.

51:21.991 --> 51:23.515
Uh, 201.

51:23.689 --> 51:25.082
All right.
You'll just stay here?

51:25.256 --> 51:26.344
I'll be back in a few.

51:26.909 --> 51:27.997
Okay.

51:39.052 --> 51:40.575
-Hello.
-Hi, there.

51:43.448 --> 51:44.492
Are you a cop?

51:45.667 --> 51:47.887
-Mm-hmm.
-Can I see your badge?

51:49.889 --> 51:51.891
Sure.

52:01.640 --> 52:04.904
Sorry, my mom says
"Always be careful around cops."

52:05.557 --> 52:06.601
What's your name?

52:08.212 --> 52:09.300
Monet.

52:10.431 --> 52:13.565
Well, listen, Monet,
I'm here because of your mom.

52:14.609 --> 52:15.741
Where is she?

52:16.220 --> 52:17.743
Don't worry.
She's safe, she's with us.

52:19.571 --> 52:20.659
Now, I'm more worried.

52:22.922 --> 52:25.229
Look.

52:26.099 --> 52:27.883
Not all of us are bad guys.

52:28.797 --> 52:31.191
We're just showing her
around the neighborhood.

52:31.365 --> 52:32.453
We'll bring her back soon.

52:32.975 --> 52:35.456
-Can I come?
-Oh, no. I'm sorry, buddy.

52:35.630 --> 52:36.718
You're too young
to come with us,

52:36.892 --> 52:37.980
but I'll tell you what.

52:38.459 --> 52:39.808
When you're old enough,

52:39.982 --> 52:41.288
I'll show you
around the neighborhood.

52:42.420 --> 52:44.161
I won't go anywhere
without my mom.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.555
Right, of course.

52:49.253 --> 52:50.863
Now, listen to me, Monet, um,

52:51.037 --> 52:54.258
do you have any relatives
or other family in town

52:54.432 --> 52:56.129
that we could call
to come watch over you?

52:58.784 --> 53:00.046
Nobody at all?

53:00.220 --> 53:02.048
Only my grandma back home.

53:02.222 --> 53:03.702
But she's far, far away.

53:04.268 --> 53:06.095
Okay, well, in that case then,

53:06.270 --> 53:08.054
um, your mom probably wants you

53:08.228 --> 53:10.578
to stay
with Mr. Walton over there

53:10.752 --> 53:12.406
until she comes back.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.408
-The giant? No, thanks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:14.582 --> 53:16.323
Just for a few hours.

53:17.411 --> 53:19.108
I'd rather be alone.

53:19.283 --> 53:22.286
Well, I-- I don't think
that's such a good idea, okay?

53:23.287 --> 53:24.766
It's just for a little while.

53:25.245 --> 53:26.681
If you don't help me,

53:26.855 --> 53:28.205
then I can't help
to bring your mom back.

53:29.858 --> 53:30.903
You understand me?

53:33.427 --> 53:34.733
Promise you bring her back.

53:41.305 --> 53:44.351
Oh, uh, Monet,
one last thing.

53:45.439 --> 53:46.962
Do you know
if your mom is colorblind?

53:48.790 --> 53:49.878
Uh...

53:50.923 --> 53:52.272
Is she?

53:52.446 --> 53:53.578
It's very important
for us to know.

53:54.927 --> 53:56.624
No, she-- she's not weak.

53:57.146 --> 53:58.626
Okay, good.

53:59.888 --> 54:01.150
Now, why don't you
pack up some stuff,

54:01.325 --> 54:03.283
Mr. Walton
will come by to get you.

54:03.457 --> 54:05.242
All right?
It'll be fun. I promise.

54:10.159 --> 54:11.248
Okay, um...

54:12.640 --> 54:14.120
look, I need you
to babysit the kid

54:14.294 --> 54:15.948
'til we figure out
the situation.

54:16.775 --> 54:19.168
No fucking way.
I don't think so.

54:19.343 --> 54:21.910
Look, I can't bring him
with me, all right?

54:22.084 --> 54:23.434
There's too much responsibility.

54:23.608 --> 54:25.218
Besides, we don't want
to see this kid

54:25.392 --> 54:27.438
watch his mom going through
this kind of an ordeal.

54:27.612 --> 54:29.440
-It's not his fault.
-Hey, it's not my fault either.

54:29.614 --> 54:30.702
I'm the victim here.

54:34.227 --> 54:36.969
You're
a retired firefighter, correct?

54:37.143 --> 54:38.753
Yes.

54:38.927 --> 54:42.670
Well, just think of this
as a fire drill, all right?

54:42.844 --> 54:44.672
Look, I'm trying
to put out a fire here.

54:45.238 --> 54:47.066
- All right?

54:47.240 --> 54:48.981
Hey, you want to kick them out
when she comes back? Great.

54:49.155 --> 54:51.679
But until then, I need you
to babysit this kid,

54:51.853 --> 54:54.378
to take care of him,
'til the smoke clears.

54:56.597 --> 54:57.903
Will I get
my money back pretty soon?

54:58.904 --> 55:00.514
Yeah, I'll do
everything in my power.

55:04.213 --> 55:05.519
Yeah.

55:08.043 --> 55:09.262
I'll be right there.

55:09.871 --> 55:12.047
I gotta go, okay?
I have all your contact info,

55:12.221 --> 55:13.440
I will be in touch.

55:14.398 --> 55:17.662
-Remember, fire drill.
-Yeah.

55:40.728 --> 55:41.773
What?

55:43.644 --> 55:44.950
Can you pass the pepper, please?

55:46.691 --> 55:47.735
It's the red one.

55:50.651 --> 55:51.696
Hello.

55:53.567 --> 55:54.612
The red one.

56:04.883 --> 56:06.188
What, you not hungry?

56:06.363 --> 56:07.755
I'm starving.

56:08.626 --> 56:09.801
What are you
waiting for? Eat.

56:11.106 --> 56:12.194
I can't eat.

56:13.413 --> 56:15.937
What do you mean you can't eat?
'Cause it's not fried chicken?

56:17.722 --> 56:19.114
I'm vegan.

56:19.288 --> 56:20.333
I'm sorry, what?

56:20.986 --> 56:22.204
I can't eat meat.

56:23.467 --> 56:24.555
I'm vegan.

56:24.729 --> 56:27.906
That's ridiculous.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.342
A Black vegan kid.

56:30.299 --> 56:32.476
What a messed-up world
we live in, I tell you.

56:34.303 --> 56:35.783
So I can't be Black,
because I'm vegan,

56:35.957 --> 56:37.655
or I can't be vegan,
because I'm Black?

56:39.265 --> 56:41.354
Oh, well, excuse me

56:41.528 --> 56:43.617
for not being prepared to,

56:43.791 --> 56:46.185
uh, take care of
a Black vegan kid.

56:46.751 --> 56:48.405
What, do you want
some ice cream, Your Majesty?

56:50.102 --> 56:51.712
Is it made
with non-dairy milk?

56:51.886 --> 56:53.322
Oh, for fuck's sakes,
come on.

56:53.497 --> 56:55.020
You said the F-word.

56:55.194 --> 56:57.414
-Yeah, so what?
-You need to rinse your mouth.

57:02.027 --> 57:03.289
There. Happy?

57:07.554 --> 57:09.687
Oh, what do vegan kids eat?

57:09.861 --> 57:10.905
Ah, ooh.

57:12.341 --> 57:14.518
There.
That vegan enough for you?

57:26.704 --> 57:28.488
Do you want to go to juvie?

57:30.664 --> 57:33.667
Okay, "They say
Black lives matter,

57:33.841 --> 57:35.582
well, I say all lives matter.

57:36.670 --> 57:38.063
.

57:39.107 --> 57:41.414
Blue lives matter,
police lives matter.

57:42.546 --> 57:44.809
No Black people--"

57:47.681 --> 57:48.726
what?

57:49.683 --> 57:50.815
What are you memorizing?

57:51.946 --> 57:53.295
You wouldn't understand.

57:53.470 --> 57:54.949
I heard you
practicing it.

57:55.123 --> 57:56.821
It's about
all lives matter, right?

57:56.995 --> 57:58.518
What?
You eavesdropping on me?

57:59.258 --> 58:01.434
I know how hard it is
to memorize something.

58:01.956 --> 58:03.828
I used to be the same at school,

58:04.002 --> 58:05.873
but they taught us
a trick that really helped.

58:06.395 --> 58:07.788
A trick?

58:08.267 --> 58:10.269
Apparently, some people
are better at looking skills,

58:10.443 --> 58:12.401
and some better
at listening skills.

58:12.576 --> 58:14.055
I guess,
you're the first kind,

58:14.229 --> 58:17.145
so it's best for you
to listen to memorize.

58:17.319 --> 58:20.061
But it's true, it's true,
you know, when I was a kid...

58:21.019 --> 58:22.542
I was a great listener.

58:22.716 --> 58:24.936
I used to spend hours
listening to the piano.

58:26.285 --> 58:27.286
So what's this trick?

58:28.722 --> 58:31.638
Have someone read it to you
over and over

58:31.812 --> 58:34.032
until it gets
into your big, giant head.

58:38.210 --> 58:41.213
-"They say Black lives matter."
- "Black lives matter."

58:41.387 --> 58:44.477
-"We say all lives matter."
- "All lives matter."

58:44.651 --> 58:47.349
-"Police lives matter."
- "Police lives."

58:47.524 --> 58:49.177
-"Law matters."
- "Law matters."

58:49.351 --> 58:50.483
"Order matters."

58:51.658 --> 58:53.007
Yeah.

58:53.573 --> 58:55.749
-"Blue lives matter."
- "Blue lives matter."

58:56.315 --> 58:57.795
"Let Black lives matter

58:57.969 --> 58:59.492
to Blacks and their own
Black neighborhood."

58:59.666 --> 59:01.146
"Let Black lives matter

59:01.320 --> 59:02.800
to Blacks and their own
Black neighborhood."

59:03.888 --> 59:06.673
"Let them keep their crimes away
from us in their streets."

59:06.847 --> 59:08.893
"Let them
keep their crimes,

59:09.067 --> 59:11.939
uh, out of our neighborhood,
off our streets."

59:12.113 --> 59:13.245
Is that right?

59:13.419 --> 59:14.942
Just forget it. Move on.

59:16.814 --> 59:18.946
"We're offering
a peaceful solution."

59:19.773 --> 59:21.949
"We're offering
a future solution."

59:22.428 --> 59:23.734
Peaceful.

59:23.908 --> 59:25.605
"A peaceful solution," yeah.

59:26.693 --> 59:28.042
Seg-- gus--

59:28.608 --> 59:29.957
What's segregation?

59:31.524 --> 59:34.440
Um, well, it's, uh, you know,

59:34.614 --> 59:36.224
Whites with Whites
and Blacks with Blacks.

59:36.398 --> 59:37.704
No mixing, you get it?

59:38.226 --> 59:40.446
No mixing, then, how do you get
a colorful palette?

59:40.925 --> 59:42.535
-A what?
- My mom mixes

59:42.709 --> 59:44.232
black and white to get gray.

59:44.406 --> 59:46.974
Then, she mixes
yellow and blue to get green.

59:47.148 --> 59:49.411
Then, she paints
a whole colorful garden

59:49.586 --> 59:50.717
with her palate.

59:51.849 --> 59:53.372
Yeah, but that's different.

59:53.546 --> 59:55.113
We're talking about people,
not paints.

59:55.722 --> 59:57.768
So paint can mix,
but not people?

59:57.942 --> 59:59.770
Well, they can mix,
but they shouldn't.

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:02.337
Look at me.

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:06.298
You know
when you're doing your laundry,

01:00:06.472 --> 01:00:08.648
you have your whites
and you have your colors,

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:10.563
and you keep them
separate, right?

01:00:10.737 --> 01:00:12.347
You don't mix them,

01:00:12.521 --> 01:00:13.784
because if you put
the whites with the colors,

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.263
the colors
will stain the white.

01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:16.700
So you gotta
keep them separate.

01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:18.353
So law and order, you see?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.967
-So is my skin stained?
- No, no.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.623
That's not what I meant.

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:28.668
What I'm saying
is that you and I

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:31.628
are not the same,
and we never will be, okay?

01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:37.198
So did God make us different?

01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:41.289
Yeah, I think so.

01:00:42.987 --> 01:00:45.467
Does God like
each of us differently?

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.687
I don't know, I'm not God.

01:00:50.298 --> 01:00:52.431
Why couldn't God make
everyone the same color,

01:00:52.605 --> 01:00:54.302
and make them all the same?

01:00:54.476 --> 01:00:55.913
Why go through so much trouble
to make us different?

01:00:57.262 --> 01:01:00.221
Look, can we get back
to work, please?

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:03.050
If we're not the same,

01:01:03.224 --> 01:01:04.835
why not divide us
from the beginning,

01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:06.663
and put each color
in a different color planet,

01:01:06.837 --> 01:01:08.534
so we'd never know
the other one existed?

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.536
Then we'd never know
that we're different.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:12.799
God sounds like a jerk that
wants us to fight on purpose.

01:01:12.973 --> 01:01:14.975
Maybe God is the one
who's colorblind.

01:01:15.149 --> 01:01:16.934
Jesus Christ, kid.

01:01:17.108 --> 01:01:19.458
I'm asking you to help me
with my speech, not give me one.

01:01:20.633 --> 01:01:21.721
I'm sorry.

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:23.549
I just miss my mom.

01:01:24.637 --> 01:01:26.465
She always says
question things...

01:01:27.422 --> 01:01:28.685
until I understand them.

01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:31.775
Yeah, I know.

01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:33.385
I know,
but some questions just...

01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:35.692
just can't be answered.

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:45.179
The truck is blue.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:52.926
The wall is white.

01:01:57.844 --> 01:01:59.585
The light bulb is yellow.

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:04.155
The plant is green.

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:06.200
The tree is green.

01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:09.029
The people are all white.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.902
People, white,
people, white, people, white,

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:13.817
people, white, people, white,

01:02:13.991 --> 01:02:16.341
people, white,
people, white, people, white.

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:18.647
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.084
Stay away from that tree.

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:21.999
Is this a family tree?

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:24.175
I said,
stay away from that tree.

01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:28.396
What about my family?
When's my mom coming back?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.182
I don't know
just stay away from that tree.

01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:32.487
It's a sacred tree.

01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:45.065
I miss her and I'm bored.

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:48.677
What do you do
when you're at home and bored?

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:50.462
I paint with my mom.

01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.681
Yeah, well,

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.509
you can't paint here
and I'm not your mom.

01:02:56.685 --> 01:02:58.339
Do you have
any games to play?

01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:01.952
Uh.

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.433
No. Only chess.
And that's not a kid's game.

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:06.783
I can play chess.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.220
You can play chess?

01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:13.441
You're a lot smarter
than you look.

01:03:19.186 --> 01:03:21.798
Well, I guess we don't have
to assign colors now, do we?

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.191
-Let's go.
- Good choice.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:25.540
Okay.

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:30.023
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.417
White always goes first.

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:34.723
I'm sorry, I forgot.

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:39.250
Do you see everything
black and white, too?

01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:41.426
- Huh?
-Nothing.

01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:48.172
That's it.

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:49.956
You can't keep running away,
I'm gonna catch you.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:58.486
Now, I'm gonna
punish your queen.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:00.880
Queen.

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:05.145
And...

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.148
checkmate.

01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:12.544
Hold on a second,
I got a phone call.

01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:15.852
Yeah, Walton here.

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:18.855
Oh, hello, officer.
Yes, yes.

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:20.552
Uh, yeah, I've been
waiting for your call.

01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:22.249
Is it my mom?

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:23.468
What?

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:25.862
The boy's right here, yeah.

01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:29.126
Hospital?
What are you talking about?

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.041
I thought I said she took him
down to the station?

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:32.694
What have you guys done?

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:35.219
What?

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.395
All right,
well, keep me posted.

01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.614
I'm not a babysitter.

01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:44.706
Oh, hey, you can't do that.

01:04:46.665 --> 01:04:47.840
Queen's off the board.

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.888
My mom says,
no matter how many times

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:54.847
you fall on your face you still
have to get back up to win.

01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:57.894
Well, I'll--

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:00.853
I'll make an exception
this time, okay?

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:03.900
Did they say
when my mom's coming back?

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:07.077
Uh, no, but I'm sure
she'll be home soon.

01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:10.645
-What's wrong?

01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:13.735
Uh, I don't know,
I'm just a little tired.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:16.521
I think it's time for my nap.

01:05:16.695 --> 01:05:17.914
What about the game?

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:21.221
-You won.
-Huh? I win?

01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:22.570
Yeah, you did.

01:05:27.445 --> 01:05:29.708
The black queen
claims her island.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:34.495
Out the white soldiers,
out the white castle.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.063
Out the white bishops.

01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:41.372
Out the white king,
your time is up.

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.765
Why don't you
make yourself busy

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.289
while I take a nap, huh?

01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:46.899
Don't wake me up.

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:49.510
What if I'm hungry?

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.686
Well, there's some, uh,

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.775
some candies in the blue jar
on the counter,

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.952
but just take them quietly
and don't wake me up

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:57.605
'cause I get
really grumpy, okay?

01:05:58.563 --> 01:05:59.781
Mm-hmm.

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.976
Oh, my God.

01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:07.545
My sweet Candy.
What the hell have you done?

01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:09.982
I told you
the fucking blue jar.

01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:11.766
Are you blind or stupid?

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.987
No, I-- I'm sorry,
the tortoise scared me.

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.380
Sorry's not gonna cut it.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.643
You know what?

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.210
If it weren't for that
nigger drunk driver,

01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:21.950
my wife would be alive
and you people

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.039
can't even leave her
in peace in her own house!

01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:25.519
I'll clean it up.

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:27.173
Well, no, no,
you'll clean it up

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:28.522
by getting the hell
out of my neighborhood.

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:30.698
-Come on.
-I'm not going!

01:07:31.264 --> 01:07:32.831
Now, look at you.
You know what?

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:34.441
Go back to the jungle
where you came from.

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:36.139
Maybe you'll find
your mother there, huh?

01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:37.488
I'm going!

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.490
Out! Get out.

01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:49.587
Oh, Shelby.
Oh, you poor old thing.

01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:50.979
Look at you.

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:53.417
It's tricky going through for--

01:07:54.026 --> 01:07:56.376
All right, man, I got you.

01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:58.335
You okay?

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:00.902
You're good?
Yeah, of course you are.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.339
Yeah.

01:08:10.999 --> 01:08:12.827
Magdalene Whyte,
a Black artist,

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:15.134
who was recently arrested
for counterfeit money,

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:18.094
is now in critical condition
after the police locked her up

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:20.183
unattended
in the car to freeze.

01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:21.880
According
to the witness footage,

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.012
she was abandoned
for 30 minutes

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:26.580
and freezing temperatures
before the officer showed up.

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:29.017
The medical staff
at the hospital confirmed

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:31.150
that Magdalene
had a history of asthma,

01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:33.631
which is believed
to worsen her condition.

01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:36.851
It was also later revealed
that she was in fact colorblind,

01:08:37.025 --> 01:08:39.245
a condition that may have
played a crucial factor

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:41.813
in her arrest and may
also prove her innocence.

01:08:41.987 --> 01:08:44.120
A peaceful protest
outside the hospital

01:08:44.294 --> 01:08:46.034
is now turning into
a violent clash

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:48.036
between the police
and the protestors

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:50.691
as they are becoming aware
that Magdalene Whyte

01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:52.606
unfortunately
just went into a coma.

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.391
Let's see
what they have to say.

01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:58.003
What do you have to say?

01:08:58.177 --> 01:08:59.787
Magdalene is still in a coma,

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.181
but her brothers and sisters
have just woken up.

01:09:02.355 --> 01:09:04.270
We are wide awake!

01:09:04.444 --> 01:09:07.186
We are wide awake!
We are wide awake!

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.146
We are wide awake!
We are wide awake!

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.843
We are wide awake!

01:09:12.017 --> 01:09:14.454
We are wide awake!
We are wide awake!

01:09:14.628 --> 01:09:16.195
We are wide awake!

01:09:16.369 --> 01:09:18.676
We are wide awake!
We are wide awake!

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:20.417
We are wide awake!

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:23.028
We are wide awake!
We are wide awake!

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:24.725
-We are wide awake!

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.859
We are wide awake!
We are wide awake!

01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.295
We are wide awake!

01:09:35.954 --> 01:09:37.216
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.872
Monet!

01:09:41.699 --> 01:09:42.743
Open the door!

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:50.534
Monet! Oh, my God.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.971
-Oh, my God!

01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:54.755
What are you doing in here?
Come on.

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.583
-Let's get you out of here.
-I'm not going with you!

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:58.281
-You have to come!
-I am not going!

01:09:58.455 --> 01:10:00.065
-You have to get up. Come on.
-I'm not going!

01:10:00.674 --> 01:10:02.633
-Monet, stop it. Stop it!
-Not going with you!

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:05.505
-There's too much smoke.
-Not going, I'm not going!

01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:08.116
All right, take it easy.
Here we go, come on.

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:11.772
Let's go upstairs,
get upstairs.

01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:23.871
Breathe in, breathe out.

01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:25.699
There you go.
You're doing good.

01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:27.310
All you need
is a little fresh air.

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:28.963
You're gonna be just fine.

01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:32.576
That's it.
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:35.274
Yeah, you want a--
you want a glass of water?

01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:37.102
I'll get you a glass of water.
Hang on.

01:10:44.414 --> 01:10:45.545
There you go.

01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:48.983
Sip it slowly now.

01:10:53.205 --> 01:10:55.381
Now, what were you doing
with all those candles?

01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:58.210
I was trying
to pray for my mom.

01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:00.343
You know, you're lucky
I'm a firefighter.

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:01.648
You could be dead.

01:11:02.519 --> 01:11:05.217
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, I'm sorry.

01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:08.176
I overreacted.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:15.009
So you're a real firefighter?

01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:18.274
Yeah, I'm--
Yes. Well, I was.

01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:23.017
How many lives have you saved?

01:11:23.931 --> 01:11:25.585
Let me see.

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:28.545
Well.

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:30.808
Not as many as I wished
I could have.

01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:33.985
Is this your wife's room?

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.597
Monet--

01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.295
why didn't you tell the truth?

01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:40.992
What truth?

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.907
That you and your mom
are both colorblind?

01:11:43.734 --> 01:11:45.301
It would have
changed everything,

01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:47.607
cleared up any
misunderstandings if we knew.

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:49.348
My mom says nothing changes

01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:51.872
as long as other person's
still colorblind.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.528
I miss her.

01:11:58.226 --> 01:11:59.358
Do you ever miss your mom?

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:01.926
My mom?

01:12:03.536 --> 01:12:04.842
Yeah,
I haven't thought about my mom

01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:06.713
in a very, very long time.

01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:11.022
I can't even remember
what it's like to be a kid.

01:12:11.196 --> 01:12:13.546
-Do you want to remember?

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.512
Try it.

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:23.730
What? Me?

01:12:23.904 --> 01:12:25.123
Uh-huh. Yes, you.

01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:26.994
Yeah, let's see.

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:28.256
Hang on.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.477
I do red here,
you do blue here.

01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:32.957
Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:36.482
So, what do you think?

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:39.180
You're just like a robot.
Let it loose.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.966
Hey, I'm a piano player,
not a painter.

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.490
I can only play the piano
with these hands.

01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:47.537
Then imagine
you're playing piano with paint.

01:12:47.711 --> 01:12:48.886
What does that mean?

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.801
Hey, hey, hey, be careful.

01:12:50.975 --> 01:12:52.629
Don't get it on the floor now.

01:12:52.803 --> 01:12:55.762
Whoa, whoa, are you--
are you out of your mind?

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.155
Come on!

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:58.896
Come on, try it.

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:00.506
You know something?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.769
I'm trying really,
really hard to like you,

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.424
but it's getting
very difficult, boy.

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.122
You told me
not to get on the floor.

01:13:08.296 --> 01:13:09.472
See? I didn't.

01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:12.170
Come on!

01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:15.956
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it, ready?

01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:24.704
-Fun, right?

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:26.576
It is kind of fun, actually.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.229
Nice play, high five.

01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:32.059
What color is this?

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.324
Purple!

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.631
Hey, you put blue and red
together and you get purple.

01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:39.850
Oh.

01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:41.460
Yeah, oh.

01:13:42.592 --> 01:13:44.550
Oh, Candace, my wife...

01:13:46.552 --> 01:13:48.206
always wanted to have kids.

01:13:48.685 --> 01:13:50.034
Now I know why.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.733
Why didn't you?

01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:57.084
Well, we almost did.

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:00.740
And then, uh...

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.830
and a drunk driver...

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.443
bad car accident...

01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:12.186
You know,
the kid we would have had--

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:15.146
had a grandchild
about your age now.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.108
- What happened?
- Oh, this old building.

01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:22.501
I'll be back in a minute.

01:14:30.248 --> 01:14:33.120
And now we are cavemen.

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:42.782
You know this--

01:14:42.956 --> 01:14:44.262
I don't know what it is,
it's very strange,

01:14:44.436 --> 01:14:45.524
but you look
awfully familiar to me.

01:14:45.698 --> 01:14:47.178
Maybe you've seen my dad.

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:49.963
My mom says we look the same.

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:51.443
Well, maybe.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.141
I wish you could have
saved him, too.

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:55.621
Saved who? Your dad?

01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:58.145
Yeah.

01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:00.583
He died from burning in a fire.

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.889
Oh, that's horrible.

01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:05.501
I'm so very sorry.

01:15:06.153 --> 01:15:07.198
It's okay.

01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:09.243
I wasn't born yet.

01:15:10.027 --> 01:15:11.419
The firefighters tried,

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:12.812
but they couldn't
get there in time.

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:16.773
When did he die?

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:19.993
While my mom
was pregnant with me.

01:15:21.778 --> 01:15:24.171
That was back home, right?

01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:26.783
No.

01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:29.742
When my mom and dad
used to be students here.

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:32.571
They used to work at
a painting studio downtown.

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:34.442
- Mm-hmm.
-One day...

01:15:35.182 --> 01:15:36.662
everything caught on fire...

01:15:38.359 --> 01:15:40.100
and burned everything.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.452
No, no,
that doesn't seem possible.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.371
It can be
if you're not careful.

01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:52.286
The paint caught on fire.

01:15:52.896 --> 01:15:54.375
Everything got burnt.

01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:03.907
-You want to come see?

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:05.299
Yeah, sure.

01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:24.754
Just don't tell my mom.

01:16:24.928 --> 01:16:26.320
She would kill me.

01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:32.588
Is this your dad?

01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:36.809
He was so burnt,
they couldn't bury him,

01:16:36.983 --> 01:16:40.073
so they put him in that jar.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:41.988
Was your wife burnt too?

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.338
No.

01:16:45.426 --> 01:16:46.602
Do you have a picture?

01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:58.614
Oh.

01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:05.621
It's-- it's--

01:17:06.099 --> 01:17:07.710
Oh.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.111
It's okay.

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:22.246
My mom says
he's in a better place now.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.595
Yeah.

01:17:26.554 --> 01:17:29.079
I-- I don't feel so good.

01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:30.167
Excuse me.

01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:44.616
Oh, look at me.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.619
Oh, God, forgive me.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.935
God, I could've saved him,
but I didn't even try.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.459
I didn't even try.

01:19:58.881 --> 01:19:59.969
Monet?

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:03.842
Monet?

01:20:07.498 --> 01:20:08.804
Monet, you in there?

01:20:10.675 --> 01:20:12.068
No, no, no, no.

01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.394
-Hey, hey.
-Yo.

01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:36.788
Do you know where
the police station is?

01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:38.224
The station
got burnt down, kid.

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:39.660
No roads in or out.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.838
You okay?
Where are your parents, huh?

01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:44.970
Hold on, kid.

01:20:45.579 --> 01:20:47.494
Mom, Mom,
are you in there, Mom?

01:20:49.279 --> 01:20:51.977
Monet! Monet!
What are you doing there?

01:20:56.547 --> 01:20:58.244
Come on, bro, come outside!

01:20:58.418 --> 01:21:00.899
Let's go!
Go home, go home!

01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:18.525
Get away from there,
it's not safe.

01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:20.136
Your mom is not there.

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:22.703
Where the hell's
the fire department?

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:26.751
Monet! Come back here!

01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:33.584
Monet!

01:21:40.286 --> 01:21:41.897
I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:21:45.378 --> 01:21:46.466
Hey, come over by the car.

01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:55.084
Here, come on.

01:21:55.998 --> 01:21:58.043
-All right.

01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:00.306
Hey, did you see a kid
when you were in there?

01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:02.221
Kid? What kid?

01:22:02.395 --> 01:22:03.744
There's a whole
bunch of people in there,

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:04.528
-we gotta get them out.

01:22:05.224 --> 01:22:06.660
I'll take care of that.

01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:08.010
You gotta get out of here,
you're free now.

01:22:08.184 --> 01:22:09.576
Come on, let's go.

01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:13.450
Free? I've always been free.
You racist son of a bitch.

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:15.408
Hey, I'm just trying
to save you, man.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:18.150
Look, the last thing I need
is a fucking white savior.

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:19.760
You're the one
that needs to be saved.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.371
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:22.938
I've seen you rant
and rave all week

01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:25.070
at those blue lives
racist rallies.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:29.248
I know a white supremacist
when I see one, okay?

01:22:31.033 --> 01:22:34.036
You don't understand,
things have changed.

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:37.082
-I've changed.
-Maybe for you, but not for me.

01:22:37.648 --> 01:22:38.823
I'm going in there
to save my people.

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:40.216
Get the hell out of my way.

01:22:56.754 --> 01:22:58.321
Hand me the boy,
hand me the boy.

01:23:01.193 --> 01:23:03.195
Everybody, come on out.
It's not safe in there.

01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:05.502
Let's go, let's go.
I can see a way out.

01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:07.678
Just head into the light,
head into the light.

01:23:08.809 --> 01:23:10.594
Follow the light,
follow the light.

01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:13.640
Follow the light,
just follow the light, guys.

01:23:14.293 --> 01:23:15.991
Anybody in there?

01:24:32.502 --> 01:24:33.764
Where are we going?

01:24:35.722 --> 01:24:38.943
We're going to the place
where the sun rises in the East.

01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:40.379
Where's that?

01:24:45.428 --> 01:24:48.387
That's out
beyond the racial rainbow

01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:50.563
of our sacred skin colors,

01:24:50.737 --> 01:24:56.352
beyond all the judgmental books
on our God given covers.

01:24:56.526 --> 01:24:59.355
Next to the alley
of acceptance,

01:24:59.529 --> 01:25:02.619
where hate loses
all its powers.

01:25:02.793 --> 01:25:05.752
There, there's a field of love

01:25:05.926 --> 01:25:10.583
for you, me,
and all humanity lovers.
