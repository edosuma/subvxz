01:55.724 --> 01:59.851
Another day to live through,
better get started.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.633
December, 1965.

02:30.634 --> 02:34.303
Is that all it has been since
I inherited the world?

02:34.304 --> 02:36.514
Only three years.

02:37.099 --> 02:39.934
It seems like a hundred million.

04:43.225 --> 04:47.853
Yeah, I own the world.
An empty, dead, silent world.

04:57.114 --> 05:01.825
More of them for the pit.
Every day there are more of them.

05:01.827 --> 05:05.996
They live off the weak ones
and leave them for the pit.

05:47.289 --> 05:50.499
K-O-K-W calling. Come in.

06:04.848 --> 06:07.266
K-O-K-W calling.

06:07.976 --> 06:12.104
I'm on international
frequency. Come in.

06:45.722 --> 06:48.640
They can't bear to see their image.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.809
It repels them.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.270
I need more mirrors.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.315
And this garlic's lost its pungency.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.373
There was a time when
eating was pleasurable.

07:12.374 --> 07:16.668
Now it bores me.
Just fuel for survival.

07:16.712 --> 07:20.547
I'll settle for coffee and
orange juice this morning.

07:20.924 --> 07:26.094
But first there is my life to consider.
I'd better replace that garlic.

07:39.026 --> 07:43.362
I need more, lots more.
Better stop off and get them.

08:05.552 --> 08:10.180
I can't afford the luxury of anger.
Anger can make me vulnerable.

08:10.265 --> 08:15.352
It can destroy my reason, and reason
is the only advantage I have over them.

08:15.687 --> 08:19.022
I've got to find where
they hide during the day.

08:19.024 --> 08:21.483
Uncover every one of them.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.945
Now, where did I
finish off yesterday?

08:24.946 --> 08:28.282
Madison Street to 31st Avenue.

08:28.492 --> 08:33.120
Eleven kills over three years.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.957
And there's more than half
the city I haven't searched.

08:58.855 --> 09:00.606
They're perfect.

09:00.607 --> 09:05.528
Just wide enough to keep the flesh
apart so their body seal can't function.

09:05.529 --> 09:08.114
How many more of these
will I have to make...

09:08.115 --> 09:10.282
before they're all destroyed?

09:10.283 --> 09:14.286
They want my blood,
it's their lives or mine.

09:14.704 --> 09:16.830
But, I still get squeamish.

09:25.006 --> 09:27.883
Wait... that garlic.

09:28.343 --> 09:30.886
I'd better put it back
where it belongs.

09:30.887 --> 09:35.307
I can't live a heartbeat away
from hell and forget it.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.731
I'm out of gas. That means one
more stop I'll have to make.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.089
I can get rid of them later.

10:49.090 --> 10:51.717
Right now, I'm out of gas.

14:12.961 --> 14:14.837
They're still fresh.

14:14.838 --> 14:18.590
But I'll take only what I need.
They've got to last.

14:51.541 --> 14:55.002
They can wait too.
I've got my life to worry about.

14:55.003 --> 14:58.421
Those mirrors have to be
replaced before dark.

15:29.162 --> 15:33.624
Square blocks to search.
How many of them still exist?

15:33.625 --> 15:36.918
How long will I have to
keep up this search?

16:42.819 --> 16:47.072
I haven't much time left.
It'll be dark in an hour.

17:35.830 --> 17:40.792
And now 12 long hours
before the sun will rise...

17:40.793 --> 17:44.295
and drive them back to darkness.

18:25.421 --> 18:28.715
Morgan, come out.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.092
Come out.

18:43.940 --> 18:49.777
Morgan, come out. Come out.

19:32.363 --> 19:34.697
Robert, help me!

19:47.545 --> 19:49.420
Another day.

19:49.630 --> 19:53.091
Another day to start all over again.

22:29.457 --> 22:31.082
Virge.

22:33.169 --> 22:35.169
Virge.

22:35.796 --> 22:38.464
God, how I miss you.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.666
The sun's already set.
They'll be everywhere!

24:21.736 --> 24:24.695
It's Morgan. Get him!

25:31.597 --> 25:33.681
Do you hear?

27:55.991 --> 27:58.200
Morgan.

27:59.703 --> 28:02.246
Do you hear, Morgan?

28:02.748 --> 28:04.248
Morgan.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.543
Do you hear, Morgan?

28:09.922 --> 28:12.173
Three years.

28:14.593 --> 28:17.970
Three years.

28:33.988 --> 28:38.199
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

28:39.159 --> 28:40.535
Hey, Virge? Virge?

28:40.536 --> 28:44.872
Yes? Oh no! My makeup. My hair!

28:46.417 --> 28:48.068
Hey, where is everybody?

28:48.069 --> 28:50.044
- All I can see is...
- Hi, Ben!

28:50.045 --> 28:53.214
I can hear children,
but I can't see any children.

28:53.215 --> 28:55.049
Uncle Ben!

28:56.010 --> 28:58.135
Uncle Ben!

28:58.596 --> 29:00.805
Look at Uncle Ben!

29:01.181 --> 29:04.266
Ben! Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!

29:08.105 --> 29:11.232
- What did you bring me?
- Open them and see.

29:11.233 --> 29:14.026
- Come. Come.
- Go on and open them Kathy.

29:27.875 --> 29:30.126
Take a look at this.

29:41.096 --> 29:44.557
- It's highly theoretical, Ben.
- Theoretical?

29:45.476 --> 29:49.937
Do I have to remind you that theory
is the beginning of solution?

29:55.319 --> 29:59.738
"Is Europe's disease carried
on the wind?" Is it, Ben?

30:00.407 --> 30:03.450
- It could be.
- And if it is?

30:03.869 --> 30:05.953
It isn't, Virge.

30:06.246 --> 30:09.290
Is that what you really think,
or just what you'd like to think?

30:09.291 --> 30:13.211
I cannot accept half-baked
theories that sell newspapers.

30:13.212 --> 30:16.422
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.424
You're whistling past the graveyard.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.344
Is that a commentary
on my work at the lab?

30:21.345 --> 30:24.389
- We both know how hard you've worked.
- I'm sorry, Ben.

30:24.390 --> 30:28.726
I just can't accept the
idea of universal disease.

30:29.895 --> 30:33.022
Uncle Ben, you promised
us card tricks.

30:33.023 --> 30:36.567
All right, Kathy.
Who can resist that face?

30:37.403 --> 30:41.071
All right. Card tricks. Card tricks.

30:43.158 --> 30:44.783
Robert...

30:44.785 --> 30:48.704
Is it possible this germ,
or virus, could be airborne?

30:50.124 --> 30:52.750
Anything is possible, Virge.

30:52.876 --> 30:56.963
The best brains in the world have
been running through this thing...

30:56.964 --> 30:58.673
with a fine-toothed comb.

30:58.674 --> 31:00.883
The germ is visible
under a microscope...

31:00.884 --> 31:04.303
but it's not like any
bacilli I've ever known.

31:05.013 --> 31:06.639
In what way?

31:06.640 --> 31:11.060
It can't be destroyed by any process
we've been able to uncover.

31:11.645 --> 31:15.773
But with the whole world trying,
there must be a solution.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.443
Mommy, when are we
gonna cut the cake?

31:20.738 --> 31:24.031
Right now our problem
is to cut that cake.

31:25.409 --> 31:29.870
- Hey, Mommy. Mommy!
- Coming. Coming.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.958
The wind wake you up?

32:56.959 --> 32:58.918
It always does.

32:58.919 --> 33:01.688
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right.

33:01.689 --> 33:04.866
- Don't get up, honey.
- I'm not sick, Bob.

33:04.867 --> 33:07.343
- I'll make your breakfast.
- You don't have to.

33:07.344 --> 33:10.513
I'll be all right.
Go on and read your paper.

33:10.514 --> 33:12.264
All right.

33:54.808 --> 33:58.102
Sweetheart, look, if you don't
feel well, please go back to bed.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.063
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

34:01.732 --> 34:04.733
I wish somebody would find a vaccine.

34:05.402 --> 34:08.445
It's all we're working
on at the lab, Virge.

34:09.197 --> 34:12.616
Maybe you better not send
her to school today.

34:13.869 --> 34:15.702
All right.

34:16.413 --> 34:20.040
- Do you think you should go to work?
- I have to.

34:20.083 --> 34:22.042
Bob?

34:22.085 --> 34:25.712
Bob, I'm so frightened.

34:26.882 --> 34:30.426
Everything's going to be
all right, sweetheart.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.043
- Well?
- The bacilli are multiplying.

35:05.545 --> 35:08.381
That kicks the bone marrow
theory in the head.

35:08.382 --> 35:10.716
This specimen shows a
higher white count...

35:10.717 --> 35:13.469
than when I put it on the slide.

35:13.720 --> 35:17.848
Those cells are still living,
Dr. Mercer, off one another.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.559
There has to be an answer.

35:20.560 --> 35:24.105
You've heard that all communications are
ended outside the continental limits?

35:24.106 --> 35:25.398
Yes, I heard.

35:25.399 --> 35:29.693
That leaves it in our laps.
So we keep trying. Where's Cortman?

35:30.028 --> 35:32.238
Well he should be here by now.

35:32.239 --> 35:35.783
You two stay on this virus theory
until I decide it's exhausted.

35:35.784 --> 35:37.326
Right.

35:38.495 --> 35:40.997
- Yes, sir?
- Morgan will fill you in.

35:40.998 --> 35:42.915
All right, sir.

35:44.960 --> 35:49.281
And what did the great man of science
have to say today? More of the usual?

35:49.282 --> 35:52.133
Oh, he's trying, Ben.
Just like the rest of us.

35:52.134 --> 35:54.218
And nothing works.

35:54.386 --> 35:57.138
The streets are swarming
with truckloads of bodies...

35:57.139 --> 35:59.974
that they're throwing
into that God-awful pit.

35:59.975 --> 36:01.892
And the dedicated
Dr. Mercer goes on...

36:01.893 --> 36:04.770
with his plodding,
unimaginative approach.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.732
- You have a better idea?
- Maybe.

36:07.733 --> 36:11.485
- At least it involves imagination.
- Ben, it's as simple as this.

36:11.486 --> 36:14.697
An unknown germ is being
blown around the world.

36:14.698 --> 36:18.242
It's highly contagious,
and it's reached plague proportions.

36:18.243 --> 36:21.787
And you don't believe some
of the dead have come back?

36:21.788 --> 36:23.914
Let's get to work.

36:25.709 --> 36:29.670
And why are they burning the bodies?
Why don't they bury them?

36:29.671 --> 36:32.673
Because it's the best known way
to control the contagion...

36:32.674 --> 36:34.717
to keep the germ from spreading.

36:34.718 --> 36:37.386
That's what we've always
believed, at any rate.

36:37.387 --> 36:41.598
- You'd prefer us to believe in vampires?
- If they exist, yes.

36:42.225 --> 36:44.685
There are stories being told, Bob.

36:44.686 --> 36:47.855
By people who are out of
their minds with fear!

36:47.856 --> 36:52.234
Maybe, but there are too many
to be just coincidental.

36:53.236 --> 36:57.864
Stories about people who have
died, and have come back.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.034
They're stories, Ben, stories.

37:00.035 --> 37:04.371
And why are the infected people
always so tired in the daytime?

37:04.372 --> 37:07.124
Why can't they stand the sunlight?

37:07.125 --> 37:09.918
Why are they only seen at night?

37:11.338 --> 37:13.130
Come here.

37:15.717 --> 37:17.510
- Look.
- I know as well as...

37:17.511 --> 37:18.635
Look!

37:21.681 --> 37:24.683
- Now, is this bacilli or isn't it?
- It doesn't alter...

37:24.684 --> 37:29.105
And this bacilli is found in the blood
of every infected person, or isn't it?

37:29.106 --> 37:32.358
To show me germs is not to
refute these stories, Bob.

37:32.359 --> 37:36.903
The point is, if there are vampires,
they exist in spite of these germs.

37:37.072 --> 37:39.656
Come on, let's get to work.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.792
Until further notice this station...

37:49.793 --> 37:53.838
will continue its around-the-clock
coverage of this national disaster.

37:53.839 --> 37:57.299
And now we switch you
to the state capitol...

37:57.300 --> 38:00.136
where His Excellency, the Governor

38:00.137 --> 38:03.305
is speaking from the
executive mansion.

38:04.141 --> 38:08.102
Further, I have in conjunction
with the Federal Government...

38:08.103 --> 38:11.313
declared this state to
be a disaster area.

38:11.314 --> 38:15.234
The public health is dependent on the
bodies of the deceased being burned.

38:15.235 --> 38:17.820
You must notify the Health
Department immediately...

38:17.821 --> 38:19.864
if you have a plague
victim in your home.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.491
Under no circumstances
should you gather publicly.

38:22.492 --> 38:25.535
In view of the dire emergency
that exists, I intend to...

38:30.834 --> 38:32.793
Anything new?

38:33.628 --> 38:35.671
No, nothing new.

38:44.514 --> 38:46.181
Nothing.

38:52.689 --> 38:54.898
Mommy, where are you?

38:56.276 --> 38:58.568
Mommy, I can't see.

38:59.279 --> 39:00.737
Mommy...

39:02.073 --> 39:05.325
- I'm going to call the doctor.
- I said no.

39:09.039 --> 39:11.916
Virge, there's nothing they can do.

39:11.917 --> 39:16.420
- But we can't just let her lie there.
- Well, this way she has a chance.

39:16.421 --> 39:20.674
If you call a doctor, he'll report it.
Do you want that?

39:26.056 --> 39:28.098
Mommy, help me.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.100
Mommy...

39:30.727 --> 39:32.811
Mommy, please help me.

39:33.146 --> 39:34.771
Mommy, help me.

39:35.899 --> 39:40.152
- How can you be so sure she's...
- Blindness is one of the symptoms.

39:40.904 --> 39:44.531
You're not to call a doctor
under any circumstances.

39:44.532 --> 39:48.368
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that.

39:48.703 --> 39:51.913
Mommy... Mommy...

39:52.832 --> 39:55.208
Mommy, where are you?

39:56.670 --> 40:01.465
I've got to pick Ben Cortman
up on the way to the lab.

40:02.217 --> 40:05.135
No one is to come into this house.

40:05.387 --> 40:07.512
Now remember that!

40:22.487 --> 40:26.198
No! No! No! Please!

40:29.369 --> 40:32.662
Please don't let him
be buried in the pit.

40:33.540 --> 40:37.584
Please, for God's sake.
Don't take him away like this.

40:37.585 --> 40:40.420
You can't! You can't!

41:15.790 --> 41:19.501
- Who's there?
- It's me, Ben. We're late.

41:25.759 --> 41:28.593
Ben, what's the matter with you?

41:28.636 --> 41:31.096
Nothing. And I'm going
to keep it that way.

41:31.097 --> 41:35.642
- Ben! Look, let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

41:36.478 --> 41:40.772
You think I'm out of my mind.
You laughed at me and my theory.

41:41.399 --> 41:42.983
You might be one of them.

41:42.984 --> 41:45.235
Ben, look, you're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.070
No doctors.

41:47.113 --> 41:50.407
You take care of your life.
I'll take care of mine.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.701
Now get away from here.

41:52.786 --> 41:55.662
You understand? Get away from here!

43:11.197 --> 43:15.033
If you're looking for
anybody but me, forget it.

43:21.416 --> 43:24.626
- Are they all gone?
- That's right.

43:24.627 --> 43:27.921
Is there any hope from
the latest reports?

43:27.922 --> 43:30.173
No, not yet.

43:30.884 --> 43:33.760
But believe me, Morgan,
we'll find an answer.

43:33.761 --> 43:37.263
When, Doctor?
We need it right now. I need it!

43:37.932 --> 43:41.810
You're the only one who wasn't
afraid to come here today.

43:41.811 --> 43:44.771
What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer?

43:45.356 --> 43:49.776
Is everybody in the world going to die
before someone finds the answer?

43:49.777 --> 43:52.028
No, I don't think so.

43:52.780 --> 43:57.826
I don't deny that there's some strange
evolutionary process going on.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.162
But mankind won't be destroyed.

44:01.206 --> 44:04.874
The fact that you and I
are working here today...

44:05.376 --> 44:07.585
is evidence of that.

44:26.523 --> 44:28.732
All right. Let's roll.

45:03.184 --> 45:04.768
When?

45:05.895 --> 45:07.187
When?

45:07.188 --> 45:09.356
I called a doctor. I had to.

45:09.357 --> 45:11.900
I told you not to call anyone.

45:11.901 --> 45:14.819
Bob, she was blind.

45:15.029 --> 45:17.030
She couldn't see.

45:17.031 --> 45:20.867
She kept reaching out her
hands, and groping for me.

45:21.744 --> 45:26.498
And all of a sudden she was gone.

45:28.668 --> 45:30.627
And they came...

45:30.628 --> 45:33.714
and I tried to stop them.
They took her.

45:33.715 --> 45:36.174
I saw a truck out there.

45:37.093 --> 45:39.761
Was that it? Was it?

45:39.762 --> 45:41.346
Yes.

45:53.860 --> 45:56.945
I'm sorry, lady.
There's nothing I can do.

45:56.946 --> 45:59.990
Let that truck through.
Get out of the way.

45:59.991 --> 46:03.326
Get back, folks.
Nobody's allowed out there.

46:03.745 --> 46:06.997
Please, all of you.
Get behind those lines.

46:06.998 --> 46:10.333
Look sharp there. Move. Move along.

46:12.629 --> 46:16.214
Make way for that truck. This way.

46:18.801 --> 46:21.970
Hey, you, mister! Come back!

46:33.149 --> 46:36.026
Did this truck just come
in from Market Street?

46:36.027 --> 46:38.904
I said, did this truck just
come in from Market Street?

46:38.905 --> 46:41.156
Mister, I don't know.

46:56.255 --> 46:59.424
Hey, you don't
belong in here. Get out.

47:00.426 --> 47:03.011
- I said get out!
- I want my daughter.

47:03.012 --> 47:06.681
Mister, a lot of daughters are
in there, including my own.

47:44.303 --> 47:46.596
Bob, I can't see!

47:46.723 --> 47:48.598
I can't see!

47:51.060 --> 47:52.352
Virge!

48:16.794 --> 48:18.795
Virge.

48:40.067 --> 48:41.651
No.

48:42.695 --> 48:45.822
I won't let them put
you there, Virge.

48:46.908 --> 48:48.741
I promise.

48:50.036 --> 48:52.787
I won't let them put you there.

50:52.783 --> 50:55.118
Let me in.

50:58.789 --> 51:01.332
Let me in.

51:02.376 --> 51:05.128
Let me in.

51:07.298 --> 51:09.924
Let me in.

51:13.846 --> 51:16.639
Let me in.

51:21.270 --> 51:23.980
Let me in.

51:23.981 --> 51:26.357
Let me in.

51:37.203 --> 51:38.995
Who is it?

51:44.210 --> 51:46.127
Who's there?

52:09.986 --> 52:13.154
Robert.

52:13.781 --> 52:15.907
Robert.

52:19.453 --> 52:22.997
Robert.

52:47.231 --> 52:49.607
Morgan.

52:49.608 --> 52:52.985
We're going to kill you, Morgan.

52:53.446 --> 52:57.156
Morgan? Do you hear?

52:57.450 --> 52:59.909
Morgan.

53:01.704 --> 53:04.455
Morgan!

53:05.499 --> 53:08.167
Do you hear, Morgan?

53:08.502 --> 53:13.589
Morgan? Do you hear, Morgan?

54:08.938 --> 54:12.273
If Cortman thinks he can get
to me by destroying my car...

54:12.274 --> 54:14.734
his wits are getting dull.

54:19.782 --> 54:22.200
This convertible would be nice.

54:22.201 --> 54:24.535
Probably handles well.

54:24.620 --> 54:26.996
But I can't think of comfort.

54:26.997 --> 54:30.249
There was a time when
I shopped for a car...

54:30.334 --> 54:33.044
but now I'm looking for a hearse.

54:33.087 --> 54:36.088
This station wagon will have to do.

55:19.592 --> 55:21.258
Alive.

55:21.677 --> 55:23.552
It's alive!

55:28.684 --> 55:31.560
Wait. Don't run away!

55:31.604 --> 55:33.438
Come back here.

55:33.439 --> 55:35.731
Don't run away!

55:40.529 --> 55:43.906
Come back. Come back here!

55:46.493 --> 55:48.703
Wherever he is, I've got to find him.

55:48.704 --> 55:51.581
If I have to search every street,
every house, every alley...

55:51.582 --> 55:54.834
every inch of this town,
I've got to find him.

55:59.757 --> 56:01.590
Come back!

56:05.554 --> 56:08.013
Hey, boy, where are you?

56:14.772 --> 56:17.440
Where are you, pal? Come here.

56:51.350 --> 56:53.309
They're dead.

56:53.310 --> 56:55.519
They've been staked!

57:04.113 --> 57:08.157
But these are made of
iron, not wood like mine.

57:12.329 --> 57:15.623
Someone else is alive in this world.

57:15.624 --> 57:18.876
But where are they?
Where are they hiding?

57:24.508 --> 57:28.260
How many are there?
Where did they come from?

57:28.387 --> 57:30.846
Why haven't I seen them?

57:38.397 --> 57:40.731
This is Robert Morgan.

57:41.358 --> 57:45.820
If somebody can hear me, answer me.

57:46.697 --> 57:49.240
For God's sake, answer me!

57:52.661 --> 57:54.912
This is K-O-K-W calling.

57:54.913 --> 57:57.122
K-O-K-W calling.

57:57.333 --> 57:59.124
Answer me.

58:33.285 --> 58:36.662
So you finally decided to come back.

58:37.289 --> 58:39.290
It's alright boy.

58:39.291 --> 58:41.250
Good boy.

58:42.127 --> 58:44.545
Oh, no.

58:48.008 --> 58:50.092
Don't worry, boy.

58:50.344 --> 58:53.804
You're going to be all right.
Yes, you are.

59:07.361 --> 59:10.571
There now, we've got
you all cleaned up.

59:11.782 --> 59:13.658
You're gonna feel better.

59:13.659 --> 59:17.578
Gonna put you down here
now and you can rest.

59:17.996 --> 59:20.706
Got you all cleaned up.

59:38.100 --> 59:40.935
You know they're out
there, don't you?

59:40.936 --> 59:43.938
You poor driven thing.

59:49.361 --> 59:52.237
Everything's going to be all right.

59:52.573 --> 59:55.032
Nobody's going to hurt you.

59:55.784 --> 59:58.619
Everything's going to be all right.

59:59.371 --> 01:00:01.205
All right.

01:00:01.415 --> 01:00:03.958
You're going to get better.

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:06.919
We're going to have lots
of happy times together.

01:00:07.754 --> 01:00:11.090
You'll see. Everything's
going to be fine.

01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:08.313
What's the use?

01:02:09.585 --> 01:02:13.462
Wait, I'm not going to hurt you.
Can't you understand? Wait!

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:35.943
Wait.

01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:39.571
I'm not going to hurt you. Wait.

01:02:41.199 --> 01:02:44.660
I couldn't be out here in the
daylight if I was one of them.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:48.163
You know that they can't
come out until sundown.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:52.584
Do you want to come with me,
or do you want to face them?

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:25.969
- You feeling better?
- Yes.

01:04:26.179 --> 01:04:30.015
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.

01:04:42.821 --> 01:04:46.698
- You seem very well organized here.
- Yeah.

01:04:48.368 --> 01:04:50.827
My name is Ruth Collins.

01:04:53.498 --> 01:04:55.499
I was married.

01:04:57.252 --> 01:04:59.378
I lost my husband.

01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:03.882
You are alone?

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.637
- You were married?
- Yes.

01:05:09.514 --> 01:05:11.265
Children?

01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:14.393
A daughter.

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:38.166
What are you doing?

01:05:41.213 --> 01:05:43.964
Please, stop! Stop it, please!

01:05:43.965 --> 01:05:45.841
You're making me sick.

01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:49.261
Why do you turn away?
Why do you turn away?

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:59.604
- You are infected.
- No.

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:05.736
Infected systems are
allergic to garlic.

01:06:06.404 --> 01:06:09.614
- You think I'm one of them.
- You will be.

01:06:11.785 --> 01:06:14.787
You've made up your
mind just because I...

01:06:14.788 --> 01:06:17.331
You can't change the
facts by talking.

01:06:17.332 --> 01:06:20.167
Facts? What facts?

01:06:21.086 --> 01:06:22.837
That I got sick?

01:06:22.838 --> 01:06:25.381
I've had a sensitive
stomach all my life.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:29.760
I saw my husband killed. Torn to
pieces, right in front of our house.

01:06:29.761 --> 01:06:32.179
I've been wandering ever since.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.515
Hiding at night.
Not eating more than scraps.

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:40.479
Sick with mourning,
sick with fear, unable to sleep.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:43.607
Then you shout at me.

01:06:43.608 --> 01:06:46.151
You chase me across
the field, hit me...

01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:48.779
drag me to this house,
and to top it all...

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.658
when I get sick because you shove
a piece of reeking garlic in my face...

01:06:52.659 --> 01:06:55.077
you tell me I'm infected.

01:06:56.872 --> 01:06:58.539
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.249
You can't go out there.
It's almost sunset.

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.084
- Let me go, I said.
- You can't go out there now.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:05.462
In a few minutes the streets
will be full of them.

01:07:05.463 --> 01:07:08.424
- I don't care.
- At least let me give you a blood test.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:10.384
Don't touch me.

01:07:11.344 --> 01:07:13.845
Don't touch me.

01:07:14.848 --> 01:07:17.057
Don't touch me.

01:07:26.359 --> 01:07:29.778
You must be hungry.
I'll fix you some dinner.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:51.967
- You know, you should eat.
- I can't.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.236
- You seem used to them.
- As much as anybody could be.

01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:15.407
I'm not frightened of them anymore,
if that's what you mean.

01:08:15.408 --> 01:08:19.662
I protect myself against them,
but only because there are so many.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.913
Individually, they're weak.

01:08:21.915 --> 01:08:25.459
Mentally incompetent,
like animals after a long famine.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.211
If they weren't...

01:08:27.212 --> 01:08:31.381
they surely would've found a way
of breaking in here a long time ago.

01:08:31.383 --> 01:08:33.591
Come out, Morgan.

01:08:36.388 --> 01:08:38.220
Hear that?

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:40.724
That's Ben Cortman.

01:08:40.975 --> 01:08:43.560
- He was my friend.
- Your friend?

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.645
He was like a kid brother.

01:08:45.647 --> 01:08:48.814
If I could find him
and destroy him...

01:08:49.484 --> 01:08:51.902
But you said he was your friend.

01:08:51.903 --> 01:08:56.406
When I find him I'll drive a stake
through him, just like all the others.

01:09:01.955 --> 01:09:06.291
But you lived through all this.
Do you know why?

01:09:07.335 --> 01:09:09.627
Perhaps I was chosen.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:13.215
That's a laugh.

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:18.261
Or perhaps it's because a long time
ago when I worked in Panama...

01:09:18.263 --> 01:09:21.014
I was bitten in my sleep by a bat.

01:09:21.474 --> 01:09:23.475
My theory is that the...

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:26.937
the bat had previously
acquired the vampire germ.

01:09:26.938 --> 01:09:28.731
By the time it entered my blood...

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:31.483
it had been strained and
weakened by the bat's system.

01:09:31.484 --> 01:09:35.319
As a result, I have immunity.

01:09:36.322 --> 01:09:39.908
It's only a guess,
but it's all I have to go on.

01:09:42.996 --> 01:09:47.832
You don't think that
I'm immune, do you?

01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:51.377
It's a simple matter to find
out whether you are or not.

01:09:57.343 --> 01:10:01.930
What will you do if I am infected?

01:10:02.182 --> 01:10:04.099
Cure me?

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:08.395
You don't have to answer.

01:10:08.396 --> 01:10:10.897
I know as well as you do...

01:10:11.983 --> 01:10:13.650
it's incurable.

01:10:13.651 --> 01:10:15.652
There might be a way.

01:10:15.653 --> 01:10:20.740
If not of killing the germ, at least of
containing it, keeping it from spreading.

01:10:21.242 --> 01:10:24.578
If I had the equipment, the time.

01:10:25.413 --> 01:10:27.497
Which you don't.

01:11:09.249 --> 01:11:11.208
You are one of them.

01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:15.378
I was. And without that
injection, I'll be one again.

01:11:15.797 --> 01:11:17.714
What do you mean?

01:11:17.715 --> 01:11:20.884
- You found a solution?
- That's right.

01:11:21.261 --> 01:11:23.720
Exactly as you said it could be.

01:11:24.389 --> 01:11:26.598
I take that for it.

01:11:28.768 --> 01:11:30.310
What is it?

01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:33.605
Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine.

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:36.525
The blood feeds the germ...

01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:39.111
the vaccine keeps it isolated...

01:11:39.112 --> 01:11:41.988
and prevents it from multiplying.

01:11:43.825 --> 01:11:46.618
We've had it for some time now.

01:11:46.828 --> 01:11:48.328
We?

01:11:48.746 --> 01:11:49.663
We?

01:11:49.664 --> 01:11:52.457
There are quite a number of us.

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:56.086
And I thought you were alone.

01:11:56.296 --> 01:11:58.755
I was going to cure you.

01:11:59.174 --> 01:12:01.633
- Does that amuse you?
- No.

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.471
Now, I want the truth.

01:12:07.849 --> 01:12:10.475
I want all of it. Why are you here?

01:12:10.476 --> 01:12:13.187
To find out if you know
any more than we do.

01:12:13.188 --> 01:12:14.980
You know far less.

01:12:14.981 --> 01:12:18.775
We're alive. Infected, yes.
But alive.

01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:21.861
We're going to reorganize society.

01:12:22.197 --> 01:12:26.867
Do away with all those wretched creatures
who are neither alive nor dead.

01:12:26.868 --> 01:12:29.744
Start everything all over again.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:33.123
And you want me to join?

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.792
You can't join us.

01:12:35.793 --> 01:12:38.128
You're a monster to them.

01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:40.839
Why do you think I
ran when I saw you?

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.467
Even though I was
assigned to spy on you.

01:12:43.468 --> 01:12:47.012
Because I was so terrified
of what I'd heard about you.

01:12:47.013 --> 01:12:51.182
You're a legend in the city.
Living by day instead of night.

01:12:51.476 --> 01:12:55.229
Leaving, as evidence of your
existence, bloodless corpses.

01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:58.815
Many of the people you
destroyed were still alive.

01:12:59.651 --> 01:13:03.236
Many of them were loved ones
of the people in my group.

01:13:04.581 --> 01:13:06.165
I didn't know.

01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:07.771
Is there any way you
can get out of here?

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:09.807
What do you mean?

01:13:10.308 --> 01:13:12.847
They're coming after you tonight.

01:13:12.848 --> 01:13:18.168
That's why I was sent here.
To prevent you from resisting them.

01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:24.090
I'm supposed to keep
you here until they come.

01:13:24.884 --> 01:13:27.969
- To kill me?
- Yes.

01:13:28.179 --> 01:13:31.055
Your new society sounds charming.

01:13:31.432 --> 01:13:35.477
The beginning of any society
is never charming or gentle.

01:13:35.561 --> 01:13:39.397
And you pretended to be
shocked at my violence.

01:13:39.941 --> 01:13:42.359
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.904
Why don't you go on and use it?
Get it over with. Use it!

01:13:45.905 --> 01:13:47.864
Get it over with!

01:13:58.042 --> 01:14:00.293
Now you know.

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:06.174
What are you going to do?

01:15:47.026 --> 01:15:51.195
- What are you doing?
- It's already done.

01:15:51.531 --> 01:15:53.031
What?

01:15:59.956 --> 01:16:01.915
Look.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:03.917
Look!

01:16:17.557 --> 01:16:20.975
You see? It worked, Ruth.

01:16:21.602 --> 01:16:24.687
The antibodies in my blood worked.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.566
My blood has saved you, Ruth.

01:16:27.567 --> 01:16:32.487
Do you know what this means?
You and I can save all the others.

01:16:32.697 --> 01:16:36.407
We won't be alone.
We'll never be alone again.

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:39.369
You are sure?

01:16:39.954 --> 01:16:41.788
Wait.

01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:01.140
Don't be afraid.

01:17:27.535 --> 01:17:29.212
- Where are you going?
- I have to get out of here...

01:17:29.213 --> 01:17:31.156
- and tell them you're not a threat to us.
- You can't go out there.

01:17:31.157 --> 01:17:34.063
You can save all of us. When they
come here there won't be time...

01:17:34.064 --> 01:17:37.060
for questions and answers.
They'll come to kill.

01:17:37.061 --> 01:17:40.805
For God's sake, Robert, let me go.
Oh Robert, please.

01:17:40.806 --> 01:17:43.349
Ruth, look. Tomorrow.

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:46.936
Please. Robert.

01:17:46.938 --> 01:17:50.606
Tomorrow, Ruth.
Tomorrow will be all right.

01:17:51.651 --> 01:17:53.860
Robert, no.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.967
- Robert.
- Yes, Ruth?

01:18:16.968 --> 01:18:20.553
- What if this doesn't last?
- But it will.

01:18:21.055 --> 01:18:24.099
I've already checked it
under the microscope.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.309
Wait, I'll show you.

01:18:26.769 --> 01:18:29.228
I'll prove it to you.
I'll check it again.

01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:54.420
Ruth, just take a look at this.

01:18:55.673 --> 01:18:57.591
This'll prove it to you.

01:18:57.592 --> 01:19:00.635
Ruth, there's no change.
I've double... checked.

01:19:01.721 --> 01:19:03.513
- Robert!
- Ruth.

01:19:04.432 --> 01:19:06.432
- Ruth!
- Robert!

01:19:06.684 --> 01:19:07.851
Ruth!

01:19:07.852 --> 01:19:10.103
Get away from her.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.440
Ruth, are you all right?

01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:15.483
Are you all right?

01:19:26.245 --> 01:19:28.663
Run, Robert! Robert, run!

01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:34.836
Run! They've come
to kill you, Robert.

01:19:48.476 --> 01:19:50.518
Run! Run!

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:13.833
Up there!

01:20:30.685 --> 01:20:32.810
There he is.

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:37.440
Wait, you don't understand. Wait!

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:41.903
Get him! Get him!

01:20:52.164 --> 01:20:53.706
Wait!

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:02.506
Surround the block. Move! Move!

01:21:13.978 --> 01:21:16.020
This way. Hey, over here.

01:21:16.021 --> 01:21:18.481
This way. Cover all sides!

01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:18.541
Stand back.

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:09.717
There he is! In the church!

01:23:15.975 --> 01:23:17.475
Over there!

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.446
Hold your fire!

01:25:05.542 --> 01:25:07.418
Freaks!

01:25:07.753 --> 01:25:09.379
All of you.

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:12.923
All of you, freaks. Mutations.

01:25:21.642 --> 01:25:23.142
Hold it.

01:25:23.143 --> 01:25:25.019
You're freaks.

01:25:25.437 --> 01:25:27.271
I am a man.

01:25:27.815 --> 01:25:30.858
The last man.

01:25:33.404 --> 01:25:35.654
Robert!

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:40.743
They were afraid of me.

01:25:41.036 --> 01:25:43.704
They were afraid of me.

01:25:44.498 --> 01:25:46.666
They were afraid of me.

01:25:46.667 --> 01:25:49.126
They didn't know.

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:31.210
Don't cry.
There's nothing to cry about.

01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:33.754
We're all safe now.

01:26:34.465 --> 01:26:36.215
All safe.
