WEBVTT

00:03.217 --> 00:06.155
Okay, folks, open your eyeholes
and shut your pieholes,

00:06.281 --> 00:07.495
'cause this is big.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.387
We've been hired to test the security

00:09.527 --> 00:12.263
of what might be the most
treasured document of our time.

00:12.375 --> 00:14.387
Constitution?
Declaration of Independence?

00:14.533 --> 00:18.202
K.F.C.'s secret recipe
of 11 herbs and spices.

00:18.427 --> 00:20.473
Awesome! Double down!
No freakin' way!

00:20.595 --> 00:21.618
I bet one is paprika.

00:21.745 --> 00:24.167
Now I need this team to
meld seamlessly, just like

00:24.300 --> 00:25.875
those 11 herbs and spices.

00:26.004 --> 00:28.126
All right, team, get on it!
We're free!

00:28.252 --> 00:32.409
Let's go, bitches! Note to self--
more white suits.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.348
Oz says I need to get
into that K.F.C. vault

00:34.477 --> 00:36.138
in under two minutes.
I'm gonna have to pull out

00:36.275 --> 00:39.590
all the stops on this one.
And you're gonna want to be organized,

00:39.739 --> 00:42.846
which is why I got you this case
for your lock-picking tools.

00:43.542 --> 00:46.125
Well, look at you being all thoughtful.

00:46.235 --> 00:48.206
Well, you know, I saw it
and thought about you.

00:48.322 --> 00:51.071
I love accessories.
Attention, fellow employees

00:51.187 --> 00:53.342
and people I haven't introduced myself to,

00:53.480 --> 00:55.471
but now it's too late,
and it would be awkward

00:55.606 --> 00:58.418
if I did it now--I think you're all gonna
want to hear this.

00:59.107 --> 01:02.415
Baby, come here. Get over here.

01:02.818 --> 01:04.212
Come here.

01:04.745 --> 01:06.282
I've done a lot of soul searching,

01:06.421 --> 01:10.103
and I come before you on bended knee.
Oh, no.

01:10.251 --> 01:14.898
Will you do me the honor...
of moving in with me?

01:15.318 --> 01:16.827
Oh, thank God.

01:17.079 --> 01:19.162
Wait. No, no, definitely bad. Still bad.

01:19.294 --> 01:20.749
Yes!
Yeah?

01:20.872 --> 01:22.254
Yeah!

01:23.131 --> 01:24.401
Come on!

01:26.403 --> 01:29.236
Living in sin and getting it in!

01:50.759 --> 01:52.220
Hello, Joshua. Very excited

01:52.342 --> 01:54.302
about our date tomorrow.
Yeah, me, too.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.686
I made an itinerary.
You'll pick me up at 7:15 P.M.,

01:57.805 --> 01:59.616
and then we'll proceed
to our fondue dinner,

01:59.737 --> 02:01.841
bond over molten cheese, enjoy some fro-yo,

02:01.974 --> 02:04.403
followed by some light petting
if we're not too gassy.

02:05.124 --> 02:09.114
Melted cheese?
The ultimate aphrodisiac!

02:09.431 --> 02:10.801
I'm a dead man.

02:17.617 --> 02:20.855
How about working on your game, man? Ugh!

02:20.972 --> 02:22.206
How could Josh do this to me?

02:22.326 --> 02:23.847
He knows I've been in love with Ana Ng

02:23.979 --> 02:26.851
since before the dawn of time!
No offense,

02:26.981 --> 02:28.386
but you've kinda known her
for, like, six months,

02:28.513 --> 02:31.854
and you've never even talked to her.
Hey, I've talked to her.

02:32.062 --> 02:33.811
So, um, uh, Jet Li--

02:33.928 --> 02:35.262
I mean, am I wrong?

02:36.404 --> 02:38.220
Uh, pandas?

02:38.911 --> 02:40.175
Hello Kitty.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.378
Should I have said "Jackie Chan"?
Wow.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.384
Listen, any other day, you
can cry on my shoulder,

02:44.514 --> 02:46.257
but not when Melanie's
moving in with Dutch.

02:46.387 --> 02:48.026
Do you know how many times
he's shown me his junk?

02:48.728 --> 02:50.524
Hey, Cam, look what I
got for your birthday.

02:50.646 --> 02:53.169
Is this anything to worry about?
Oh! Ugh!

02:53.376 --> 02:56.994
Hey, Cam, check out my new belt buckle.

02:57.744 --> 03:00.375
Ohh! Gotcha.
Ugh!

03:00.503 --> 03:01.911
Learn from my mistakes.

03:02.032 --> 03:04.216
She's already made her decision.
She's moving in with him.

03:04.336 --> 03:05.662
I mean, it's just so frustrating.

03:05.803 --> 03:07.683
Can't Melanie open her
eyes and think for once?

03:07.820 --> 03:09.582
She's being so stupid.
I just want to shake her and say,

03:09.718 --> 03:10.843
"Get a brain in your head!"

03:10.973 --> 03:13.751
Why is everybody just standing around?
Come on! Move it!

03:13.868 --> 03:15.954
Let's make colonel Harland Sanders proud!

03:18.298 --> 03:21.328
Right this way.
All right.

03:21.450 --> 03:23.913
Okay. I jammed the cellular
connection on the alarm system

03:24.033 --> 03:25.638
so it can't dial out.
Should give us enough time

03:25.773 --> 03:27.821
to get that secret recipe. Mel, you're up.
Ooh,

03:27.970 --> 03:30.331
I'm honored you would trust
this to my little pea brain.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.225
What is her deal?

03:38.712 --> 03:39.803
We're in.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.333
It's more beautiful than I imagined.

03:49.662 --> 03:51.095
Guys, we have to get moving!

03:51.254 --> 03:53.061
Those alarms are gonna
go off in 15 seconds.

03:53.203 --> 03:54.491
Guys, I gotta blerf blerf blerf

03:54.630 --> 03:56.653
'cause I stole Ana Ng from Cash!
Okay,

03:56.783 --> 03:58.711
first of all, you really
need to work on your me,

03:58.846 --> 04:00.306
'cause at no point did I say "blerf."

04:00.430 --> 04:02.042
You gotta work on your blerf,

04:02.181 --> 04:04.964
'cause at no point did I say, "blerf blerf."
Okay, guys, guys,

04:05.086 --> 04:06.148
please, please.
We gotta switch this out now.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.450
Melanie, hand me the dummy envelope.

04:07.570 --> 04:09.165
Of course I would have the dummy envelope.

04:09.285 --> 04:10.525
I don't know what's going
on with you right now...

04:10.622 --> 04:14.376
But we don't have...
Aah! Aah!

04:15.813 --> 04:18.963
You think the recipe is wet?
Whoa!

04:21.855 --> 04:26.863
You guys had one job--
steal the colonel's secret formula--

04:26.985 --> 04:29.888
and you finger-licked it up
pretty darn good, didn't ya?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.667
You touch that drumstick,
I'll chop yours off.

04:32.788 --> 04:34.935
Chicken is for closers.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.738
If we'd been successful at this job,

04:36.868 --> 04:40.359
K.F.C. would've hired us to
do their security worldwide.

04:40.475 --> 04:42.809
Well, Melanie wouldn't give me the envelope.
Oh, okay!

04:44.130 --> 04:45.558
Enough!

04:45.707 --> 04:48.117
I need a team that will walk
through fire for each other.

04:48.260 --> 04:50.414
You guys will sell each other
out at the drop of a hat.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.164
Yo, brother, could you make
this rant kinda quick?

04:53.286 --> 04:54.897
I got a shiatsu in 20.

04:55.027 --> 04:57.913
I got something for ya.
Sasquatch.

05:02.323 --> 05:05.091
Oz, what did you do to him?

05:05.209 --> 05:07.712
It's just a garden variety hypnotic trance.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.415
Dutch is amusing to a point,

05:09.550 --> 05:13.052
but I put in a safeguard to shut
him down for moments like this.

05:13.445 --> 05:15.449
I mean, six weeks?
That's a long time

05:15.568 --> 05:17.112
to be working at one place without a raise.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.908
I got crazy expenses--

05:19.103 --> 05:23.410
bronzing, frosting, waxing...

05:24.319 --> 05:25.843
Breathe deep.

05:25.965 --> 05:28.807
From this moment forward,
the trigger word will be...

05:29.134 --> 05:32.010
Sasquatch.
You're not gonna zombify the rest of us, are you?

05:32.147 --> 05:34.954
Yeah, I can't be no zombie.
Well, you better shape up.

05:35.086 --> 05:38.452
Nobody leaves this office
until you guys stop acting

05:38.573 --> 05:41.232
like little babies and
start acting like a team,

05:41.370 --> 05:44.488
and that means team-building exercises.

05:44.614 --> 05:46.631
Bullpen, five minutes.
What?

05:46.759 --> 05:49.346
Bitches, we are dead meat.
So dead.

05:49.486 --> 05:52.569
What's the big deal?
I can handle a couple trust falls.

05:52.692 --> 05:55.846
Trust falls would be easy.
This is Contra team building.

05:57.397 --> 05:59.591
Yeah!

06:00.938 --> 06:02.943
Now that you've all mastered the apple,

06:03.099 --> 06:04.036
let's up the stakes a little bit

06:04.178 --> 06:07.652
with a game I like to
call pass the grenade!

06:10.402 --> 06:12.666
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:13.585 --> 06:15.493
The grenade was fake...

06:16.551 --> 06:18.940
But the fear was real.

06:19.300 --> 06:20.372
Let's just suck it up

06:20.492 --> 06:22.599
and get through this stupid team building.

06:22.726 --> 06:25.940
Well, if it's stupid, it
must be my cup of tea.

06:26.072 --> 06:27.730
Okay, what is your deal?

06:27.863 --> 06:29.817
I heard you talking smack about me to Cash.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.717
You... you think I'm stupid.
You wanna put a brain in my head.

06:32.848 --> 06:33.828
Okay, I get it.

06:33.946 --> 06:35.691
I'm not the smartest person who works here.

06:35.786 --> 06:39.779
We didn't all get to go
to college or high school

06:40.067 --> 06:41.029
or middle school.

06:41.159 --> 06:44.142
No, you're totally misunder--
Middle school? Really?

06:44.286 --> 06:47.599
My dad was a grifter! I'm street smart.

06:47.913 --> 06:50.700
You think a stupid person can do this?

06:51.639 --> 06:55.638
Yeah, just picked your pocket.
Ooh, $7.

06:55.775 --> 06:57.449
Watch out, ladies.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.594
Wait. Hold it.

07:03.712 --> 07:04.934
What?

07:05.260 --> 07:07.005
Where'd everybody go?

07:07.273 --> 07:09.435
Why does this keep happening to me?

07:09.580 --> 07:10.737
Wait. Come on, Melanie.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.622
You're taking what I said out of context.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.946
Um, Oz isn't in his office,

07:15.122 --> 07:16.343
and everybody else is gone,

07:16.486 --> 07:19.244
so it looks like team building is canceled.

07:19.365 --> 07:22.119
Thank God. I think we can all
use a break from each other.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.563
Not so fast, mutants.

07:24.676 --> 07:26.801
The team building's just beginning.

07:26.926 --> 07:29.805
See, unless you guys can find
a nice way to work together,

07:29.930 --> 07:32.052
you're gonna be trapped here all weekend.

07:33.178 --> 07:36.063
Guys! Front door is locked.

07:36.191 --> 07:38.348
The back door is locked, too.
What the hell is going on?

07:38.482 --> 07:40.630
You folks are the best in the
business at breaking in.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.951
Well, let's see how good you are
at breaking out--of Contra.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.658
No, no, no, no, no. I gotta get outta here.

07:45.791 --> 07:48.128
There's a special-edition
screening of "Tron" tonight.

07:48.254 --> 07:50.534
I've been polishing my helmet all week.

07:51.191 --> 07:53.628
Oh. Thank God it's an actual helmet.

07:53.749 --> 07:56.007
Screw this noise. I'll get us outta here.

07:59.194 --> 08:02.383
Oh! My face! That's my meal ticket.

08:02.617 --> 08:05.787
Seriously. I model for an
energy drink calendar.

08:05.918 --> 08:06.769
I'm Mr. June.

08:09.761 --> 08:11.686
What are you doing there, sugarplum?

08:11.798 --> 08:13.358
You really think I'd let you just lock-pick

08:13.482 --> 08:15.303
your way outta here?
No, no.

08:15.417 --> 08:18.928
You guys have to work together as a team.

08:19.062 --> 08:21.269
And don't bother trying
to call anybody for help.

08:21.383 --> 08:23.230
He's right. I got no signal.
Yeah, me neither.

08:23.355 --> 08:25.226
Oz must have knocked out
the wireless booster.

08:25.353 --> 08:27.531
Damn it! I just bought this!

08:27.873 --> 08:30.780
Your phone would've...
Never mind. Good choice.

08:30.887 --> 08:34.323
Come on, folks!
Teamwork makes the dream work.

08:34.438 --> 08:36.745
Oh, and if your tummies start
to get a little growly,

08:36.857 --> 08:38.484
I left you some yummies in the fridge--

08:38.614 --> 08:41.302
lasagna, just like mom used to make.

08:44.198 --> 08:46.139
Sometimes I panic-eat.

08:51.177 --> 08:54.064
Okay, here's what we're gonna do--
We fix the van

08:54.208 --> 08:57.152
and then we try to drive it
through the doors again.

08:57.271 --> 08:59.253
Hey, I'm blacking out.
Yep.

09:02.203 --> 09:04.324
Okay, we're trapped, and
you're not helping, Cash.

09:04.446 --> 09:05.753
What the hell are you doing?

09:06.001 --> 09:08.217
I'm building one of my signature gadgets.

09:08.349 --> 09:10.387
I had to take apart the
fridge for the freon.

09:10.492 --> 09:12.578
What, are you gonna freeze the
hinges off the front door?

09:12.703 --> 09:15.591
No, I'm building a time machine.
When we get outta here,

09:15.716 --> 09:17.543
I'm gonna go back to Ana Ng's childhood,

09:17.650 --> 09:20.330
meet up with her in a field,
make her fall in love with me,

09:20.451 --> 09:23.898
then tell her I will return.
That's "The Time Traveler's wife."

09:24.011 --> 09:25.317
On the off chance that doesn't work,

09:25.447 --> 09:27.368
I've run a hacking program
for the last three hours.

09:27.493 --> 09:29.362
It's gonna bust right through Oz's system.

09:29.485 --> 09:33.040
Whatever. Now get the flux
capacitor outta here.

09:36.361 --> 09:37.902
Dutch? You okay?

09:38.069 --> 09:40.389
Yeah, I was just huffing some paint.

09:40.532 --> 09:43.111
Ah, I can't lie to you, Cam.
I wasn't huffing paint.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.205
I just told you that so you'd respect me.

09:45.316 --> 09:47.595
I'm freaking out over
this whole Melanie thing.

09:48.541 --> 09:50.703
Aren't you the one who
asked her to move in?

09:50.830 --> 09:52.962
Yeah, to my place,

09:53.090 --> 09:54.777
Casa de Dutch.

09:54.922 --> 09:58.158
Dude, I got a sweet 2-headed
shower, an at-home tanning bed,

09:58.289 --> 10:01.131
and a bidet, son! But this morning,

10:01.495 --> 10:04.044
Melanie gave me a bunch
of apartment listings.

10:04.165 --> 10:06.736
She wants to find a new place.
That wasn't the dealio.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.673
The plan was to have her weave herself

10:08.794 --> 10:10.907
into the fabric that is my awesomeness.

10:11.021 --> 10:13.618
Okay, well, Dutch, relationships
are about compromise.

10:14.357 --> 10:15.805
Exactly.

10:15.979 --> 10:17.510
Hey, maybe you can convince her

10:17.648 --> 10:19.412
to compromise and move in with me!

10:19.535 --> 10:22.636
She trusts you, Cam!
You're like her gay best work friend.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.535
For the hundredth time... not gay.

10:24.644 --> 10:27.949
I'm sorry, dude.
Closet gay best work friend.

10:28.075 --> 10:29.248
Not gay.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.049
Wow. Look at that dress. Oh, my God.

10:33.185 --> 10:35.632
Wow. Look at that dress. Oh, my God.

10:35.752 --> 10:37.221
Hey, you wanna go splitsies on this salad?

10:37.337 --> 10:38.997
It's way too big for me to finish.

10:39.074 --> 10:41.978
It's got a basil-oregano thing going.
It's--it's really good.

10:41.979 --> 10:43.827
Oh, you know, I saw it
and thought about you.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.212
I love accessories.

10:45.588 --> 10:46.765
Talk to her, man.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.659
Get her to move into my place.

10:49.198 --> 10:52.239
What do you say? Come on, bro.

10:52.858 --> 10:56.177
Broheim-oth. Bro-sario Dawson.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.887
Angelina Bro-lie.

10:57.888 --> 10:59.303
Sasquatch.

11:00.905 --> 11:03.694
Wow. That is useful.

11:04.528 --> 11:05.843
Oh, finally.

11:05.844 --> 11:07.646
I think I found a hole in Oz's system.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.004
Au contraire, mon frere.

11:10.187 --> 11:12.296
It's gonna be tough to do
all that clickety clack

11:12.297 --> 11:14.928
without any Internet or power. Boop.

11:15.524 --> 11:17.467
Cam, what the hell did you do?

11:17.999 --> 11:20.622
Oh, no. I'm okay.
I fell on some soft pillows.

11:20.623 --> 11:23.048
That's me! Oh. Ooh. Ow!

11:26.371 --> 11:27.144
What?

11:27.145 --> 11:31.309
Great, Cam. Now we have no A.C,
no lights, no Internet.

11:31.310 --> 11:33.368
Ergo... no pornography.

11:33.369 --> 11:34.753
And we're running really low on food.

11:34.754 --> 11:36.682
Guys, guys, I know we hate
each other right now,

11:36.683 --> 11:38.288
but it's a team-building exercise,

11:38.289 --> 11:40.156
so let's just pretend to like each other.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.552
Come on. We come up with one good idea,

11:41.553 --> 11:43.124
we'll be outta here in a half-hour max.

11:45.417 --> 11:46.928
Well, this sucks.

11:47.231 --> 11:50.467
So far Cash has given us a lot
of vulgar nicknames for Josh,

11:50.468 --> 11:54.222
and the other half are shockingly
vulgar nicknames for me.

11:54.639 --> 11:55.386
You're welcome.

11:55.387 --> 11:58.040
Which brings us to the only
legitimate idea we have--

11:58.513 --> 12:00.235
Cash's time machine.

12:00.236 --> 12:01.849
W-wait. Wait, guys.

12:02.553 --> 12:03.746
I know I talk a good game,

12:03.747 --> 12:06.568
but I've never actually
time-traveled before.

12:06.881 --> 12:08.887
All right, what do you say
we take a hard 5-hour break

12:08.888 --> 12:10.332
and attack this with fresh eyes?

12:10.333 --> 12:11.241
Cool. I'm out.

12:11.242 --> 12:15.286
Yep. Hey. Hey. We've gotta get outta here.

12:15.287 --> 12:16.940
You're--you're spitting on me.

12:16.941 --> 12:17.968
You talked to Mel?

12:17.969 --> 12:18.791
No.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.174
I-I don't really feel comfortable getting

12:20.175 --> 12:22.666
in the middle of your relationship, okay?

12:22.667 --> 12:24.009
Why don't you talk to her?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.495
Because I don't want to mess it up.

12:26.207 --> 12:27.877
The more I think about
this new apartment thing,

12:27.878 --> 12:28.961
the more I'm buggin'.

12:29.285 --> 12:31.063
I'm not ready to give up my freedom, Cam.

12:31.954 --> 12:34.170
Look, none of this changes
the way I feel about her.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.429
I mean, next to Melanie, every
other girl looks like some big,

12:36.430 --> 12:37.623
nasty sasquatch.

12:40.068 --> 12:42.712
Oh, the very rare self-sasquatch.

12:42.713 --> 12:43.580
I didn't believe it was real.

12:43.678 --> 12:45.724
Did you just sasquatch him?

12:45.736 --> 12:47.317
No, no. He did it to himself.
Oh,

12:47.318 --> 12:49.974
what, you're telling me
he self-sasquatched?

12:49.980 --> 12:51.659
Okay, you know, I'm tired of this crap.

12:51.660 --> 12:52.990
I'm getting myself outta here.

12:56.132 --> 12:57.942
I just grazed his junk.

12:58.894 --> 13:00.326
Dude, give it up.

13:00.327 --> 13:01.745
We're never gonna get out of here.

13:01.888 --> 13:04.081
Much like the lasagna, we're finished.

13:04.082 --> 13:05.982
Oh, by the way, I ate all the lasagna.

13:07.008 --> 13:08.729
Yeah. You know, that jag man makes a point.

13:08.838 --> 13:10.376
I say we declare defeat.

13:10.758 --> 13:12.869
Defeat? I'm in.

13:15.231 --> 13:17.861
Defeat? Am I really hearing this?

13:17.862 --> 13:19.819
Very disappointing, munchkins.

13:19.820 --> 13:20.888
Look behind you.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.788
You!

13:22.789 --> 13:23.877
Me!

13:24.063 --> 13:25.121
You came back?

13:25.122 --> 13:26.531
Technically, I never left.

13:27.022 --> 13:28.672
I gave up my whole weekend

13:28.673 --> 13:31.210
to teach you sad sacks
how to work together,

13:31.211 --> 13:34.478
even used a little movie
magic to make it look legit.

13:34.524 --> 13:37.950
Not so fast, mutants.
The team building's just beginning.

13:38.197 --> 13:41.082
The way out was simple.
I left you a lasagna.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.550
If you put your heads together,
you would have remembered that

13:43.551 --> 13:46.566
the acid in the tomato sauce
is a known corrosive.

13:46.567 --> 13:48.989
You could've used that to
disable the locking mechanisms

13:48.990 --> 13:50.658
and get outta here as a team.

13:50.659 --> 13:52.321
Yeah, that was so obvious.

13:52.322 --> 13:54.908
Duh! We can always use the
battery acid from the van,

13:54.909 --> 13:56.325
salvage what's left of this weekend.

13:56.326 --> 13:57.550
I've got countries to visit.

13:57.607 --> 13:59.365
Well, the battery's kinda shot

13:59.366 --> 14:01.467
because Dutch obliterated the van.

14:01.589 --> 14:03.842
All right, plan "B."
I'll just switch the power back on,

14:03.843 --> 14:04.888
and we'll get outta here.

14:08.988 --> 14:10.990
Oh. Impressive.

14:10.991 --> 14:14.629
It seems Cameron's hack job
overrode my system. Where is he?

14:14.630 --> 14:15.744
I need him to shut it down.

14:15.745 --> 14:18.008
He's in the vents, trying
to find a way out.

14:18.401 --> 14:19.730
The vents?

14:21.431 --> 14:22.989
You let him go up in the vents?

14:26.830 --> 14:28.381
Oh, crap!

14:37.106 --> 14:39.545
Not good. Not good. Not good.
I installed security gates

14:39.546 --> 14:41.346
in the vents in case
somebody tries to break in.

14:41.359 --> 14:43.926
Josh, give me the time.
Uh, 4:32 A.M.

14:43.927 --> 14:45.182
Oh, that's really not good.

14:45.183 --> 14:46.886
Why are you panicking? You never panic.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.714
Because the heat kicks on at 4:30.

14:48.715 --> 14:49.965
Well, we'll override the program.

14:49.966 --> 14:51.770
Again, I need Cameron for that.

14:51.771 --> 14:53.286
Well, what happens when the heat turns on?

14:53.287 --> 14:56.312
Well, he'll do some sweating, then... die.

15:02.390 --> 15:04.763
Why? Why?!

15:05.595 --> 15:08.718
Why couldn't we have done trust falls?!

15:08.719 --> 15:10.275
Guys, it's 125 degrees up there,

15:10.276 --> 15:12.859
which means we have approximately
30 minutes to get Cameron out.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.200
Mel, gear up and hydrate.
You're going in. Unlock that grate.

15:15.201 --> 15:16.780
Josh, find the blueprints to these vents.

15:16.781 --> 15:18.080
Cash, how's that rover coming?

15:18.081 --> 15:20.329
It's on like Tron, boss man.

15:20.399 --> 15:21.462
You think he's okay?

15:21.463 --> 15:28.718
♪ But you'll look sweet upon the
seat of a bicycle built for two ♪

15:30.729 --> 15:32.078
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

15:36.474 --> 15:39.681
Oh, it's so hot in here. I'm baking alive!

15:40.468 --> 15:41.839
Hey, Sammy.

15:42.329 --> 15:43.650
Oh, you're so cute!

15:43.651 --> 15:46.241
Give me a kiss. Come on.

15:46.554 --> 15:47.599
Come on.

15:47.612 --> 15:48.641
I'm on it.

15:49.306 --> 15:50.557
Be careful, baby.

15:50.652 --> 15:52.326
Okay, he's 20 feet to your north.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.583
Get him water fast.

15:54.069 --> 15:54.997
Cam?

15:54.998 --> 15:56.610
The heat's rising. We don't have much time.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.219
Melanie! Over here!

16:00.117 --> 16:03.629
Put this around your neck and drink this.
Okay. Yes.

16:03.918 --> 16:07.583
Oh, water, yes.
I've always enjoyed this beverage.

16:07.584 --> 16:08.651
Mmm!

16:10.069 --> 16:11.826
You're using your lock-picking case.

16:11.827 --> 16:14.459
Just sit tight.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

16:15.328 --> 16:16.808
I love you.

16:17.783 --> 16:19.822
Yes, Cameron, I love you, too.

16:19.866 --> 16:24.149
No, like, I love you... for real.

16:24.509 --> 16:26.261
Seriously, Melanie.

16:26.332 --> 16:28.256
The first time I saw you crack a safe,

16:28.257 --> 16:30.320
I knew I was in love with you.

16:30.508 --> 16:31.828
And you're cool

16:31.829 --> 16:35.290
and you're smart and--and every song
on your iPod is good,

16:35.291 --> 16:36.874
and that is unheard of.

16:38.509 --> 16:40.402
You're hallucinating.

16:40.403 --> 16:41.608
No, I'm not.

16:42.237 --> 16:44.749
I wish I didn't feel this way, but...

16:45.236 --> 16:46.575
But I do.

16:46.743 --> 16:47.961
When you overheard me the other day,

16:47.962 --> 16:49.722
I wasn't calling you stupid,

16:49.723 --> 16:51.127
I was saying it's stupid...

16:52.676 --> 16:54.471
You're moving in with Dutch,

16:55.348 --> 16:56.728
because...

16:57.692 --> 17:01.094
I'm jealous you're with
him and--and not me.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.169
Well, don't just lie there. Say something.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.723
Cam, I'm on your left!

17:11.134 --> 17:14.493
It was taking too long. I got worried.

17:14.494 --> 17:17.818
Well, this is a low point.
Dutch, just--just--just go back.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.159
I-I got it, okay?

17:19.160 --> 17:22.482
The vent's too small! I'm stuck!

17:23.215 --> 17:25.200
Of all the days not to grease up.

17:25.201 --> 17:27.711
Seriously, I can't move a muscle!

17:27.723 --> 17:31.508
Damn this Adonis-like torso.
Oh, it's so hot in here!

17:31.509 --> 17:33.864
Hold tight. We're coming up.
I'm trapped!

17:34.258 --> 17:35.652
I'm totally trapped!

17:36.135 --> 17:37.397
Help me, lord!

17:37.398 --> 17:40.362
I don't want to die in here! I'm too sexy.

17:40.463 --> 17:41.849
God, help me!

17:43.113 --> 17:44.565
This is embarrassing!

17:44.566 --> 17:48.117
Dutch, just relax. Breathe.
I can't.

17:48.118 --> 17:50.233
It's this whole moving in thing, Mel.

17:50.234 --> 17:52.900
Look, I love you so much, I wanna explode,

17:52.926 --> 17:55.042
but being trapped here like this,

17:55.043 --> 17:58.315
it just... it made me realize that...

17:58.931 --> 18:00.989
I need my space!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.407
I'm sorry!

18:02.976 --> 18:06.053
Okay, kind of a lot of things
coming at me right now.

18:06.145 --> 18:07.969
Hey, on your right.

18:07.970 --> 18:08.687
We brought some motor oil

18:08.688 --> 18:10.981
- so we could slather up Dutch
and get him outta here. - Oh,

18:11.992 --> 18:14.466
I love you guys so much, I wanna explode.

18:14.535 --> 18:18.421
Cam, you're the closest to Dutch!
Lube him up! Lubricate!

18:18.422 --> 18:21.370
I can't reach. Forget about me.
Save yourselves!

18:21.371 --> 18:23.944
No, no, no! We're all getting
out of here together.

18:23.945 --> 18:25.269
Damn right. I'm not leaving

18:25.270 --> 18:27.113
till every last one of us is out of here.

18:27.114 --> 18:29.511
Exactly. We die as a team.

18:30.315 --> 18:31.474
I love you guys.

18:31.475 --> 18:34.042
Yeah. I love you guys, too.

18:34.164 --> 18:38.557
Now that is the kind of teamwork
that I was talking about.

18:38.558 --> 18:41.769
Two days ago you guys couldn't even
steal a recipe without bickering.

18:41.770 --> 18:44.470
Now you're willing to walk
through fire for each other.

18:44.786 --> 18:49.661
Wait. This was all fake?
But the fear was real,

18:49.947 --> 18:53.211
so was the team building.
Nice job, folks.

18:53.212 --> 18:56.466
And as a reward, your
68 degrees of cool A.C.

18:57.927 --> 19:00.408
Ahh! That's good.

19:00.409 --> 19:01.857
And your freedom!

19:02.572 --> 19:03.676
Oh, thank you, dear lord!

19:03.677 --> 19:04.691
Oh, my God.

19:05.032 --> 19:06.134
I'm free!

19:06.579 --> 19:09.414
Free! Yeah, but I'm still stuck.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.600
Cam?

19:12.577 --> 19:14.013
Get to lubing.

19:19.062 --> 19:20.912
Freedom!

19:21.242 --> 19:22.803
You lunatic!

19:22.956 --> 19:24.459
You're learning!

19:24.701 --> 19:26.974
Oh, my back. Ah! Ah!
Hey, man, I've been thinking.

19:26.975 --> 19:29.066
Hmm?
I'm not gonna go out with Ana Ng.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.602
Oh, good. I can ask her out, then.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.264
You're gonna ask out my girl?

19:32.567 --> 19:34.094
Well, I take it back.

19:34.095 --> 19:35.921
Are you out of your mind?

19:36.200 --> 19:39.144
You were willing to bake me for
a team-building exercise?!

19:39.145 --> 19:41.399
Relax. You were never in any real danger.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.771
I was monitoring your core
temperature the whole time.

19:43.772 --> 19:46.235
How could you be monitoring
my core temperature?

19:46.236 --> 19:48.122
I certainly haven't
implanted a chip in you,

19:48.123 --> 19:49.861
if that's what you're insinuating.

19:50.555 --> 19:52.016
No, Oz, this is serious.

19:52.017 --> 19:55.318
Some things were said up there
that I can't take back ever.

19:56.268 --> 19:57.435
What?

19:57.436 --> 19:59.582
That stuff about you being
in love with Melanie?

19:59.778 --> 20:02.976
Something tells me that particular
feline is out of the bag.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.357
I lubed Dutch!

20:06.402 --> 20:08.065
Team building!

20:09.549 --> 20:10.719
Hey.

20:11.113 --> 20:12.257
Hey.

20:12.424 --> 20:15.196
Uh, listen, I said some stuff
back there that I--

20:15.197 --> 20:16.304
Oh, no, no. Stop.

20:16.305 --> 20:18.552
I know you didn't mean that stuff.
I mean, you were loopy.

20:18.553 --> 20:21.602
Why don't we just chalk it
up to extreme circumstances?

20:21.603 --> 20:24.535
Yeah, writing it off.
That seems like a good strategy.

20:24.553 --> 20:26.262
Yeah. 'Cause I mean, if I
really meant that stuff,

20:26.263 --> 20:27.554
and we still had to work together,

20:27.672 --> 20:30.332
that would be really awkward.
It would be really awkward,

20:30.793 --> 20:33.283
especially since my boyfriend works here.

20:33.284 --> 20:36.869
Yes. So many examples of
why it would be awkward.

20:37.726 --> 20:40.709
So... friends?

20:41.134 --> 20:43.351
Absolutely. Friends.

20:45.718 --> 20:47.168
Oh.

20:48.115 --> 20:50.797
So where'd you and Dutch land on the
whole moving in together thing?

20:51.259 --> 20:52.791
Oh, I mean, we talked about it.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.163
Decided we're gonna give
it a little more time.

20:55.164 --> 20:58.202
I gotta be honest.
I was--I was pretty nervous about it, too.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.796
Well, you're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.

21:02.368 --> 21:03.545
Yeah.

21:04.349 --> 21:06.269
I'll see you Monday.
It is Monday!

21:06.366 --> 21:08.887
I don't know about you guys, but
I feel pretty rested. Uh, uh...
