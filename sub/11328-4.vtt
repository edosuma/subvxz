Previous on the secret
life of American teenager.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.500
There must be something
I can do for you today.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.500
Can you bring back my dad?

00:06.800 --> 00:09.300
I just can't beleive I like you
talk me to have sex with you.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.600
But we didn't kill your father.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.200
yes,we did.I am hate you.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.100
whoes gonna watch John
and the other children

00:15.100 --> 00:16.700
if you went on the doctor,
they are hero.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.400
I'm tired of working.
I want to go out.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.000
you'd better not be? with age
because you are not getting sex of me.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.200
We are not enough of a couple
to go to funeral together.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.200
I just don't kown how this
could have happen to the two us

00:28.300 --> 00:31.200
Maybe someone was in quite
a hand with a???

00:31.400 --> 00:33.300
It's my sex life,I quite.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.900
Nothing you did cause your father to die.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.800
Please go to the funarel of your family.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.100
Are you sure this isn't you baby?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.100
I'm sure I have told you.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.900
You are gonna go to whatever service
your dad planned for himself.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.700
Don't be stupid, Jack.
Never drink alone.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.600
If your dad was here now,
he'd probably kill you for acting like this.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.800
Go out there and do
what you have to do.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.200
He loved you.
No matter what, he loved you.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.100
You know that.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

01:06.600 --> 01:07.700
How was he?

01:08.300 --> 01:10.100
He was just hungry and wet.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.200
He's okay now, though.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.800
- What time is it?--
- It's 4:30.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I can't decide if I should stay awake and
study or if I should go back to sleep.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.400
I know.I feel like
I should go back to bed,

01:20.400 --> 01:23.200
but we've been up for so long,
It feels like it should be daylight already.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.600
- I'm sorry, Mom.--
- It's okay.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.400
I'll be apologizing to you
soon enough for the same thing.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.600
Did David call?

01:29.700 --> 01:31.900
No. I don't know what time
his flight is getting in.

01:32.600 --> 01:33.800
He said it would be late.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.600
Well, he didn't tell me.
He had his assistant call and tell me.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.800
Oh.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.400
I have a feeling he's avoiding me.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.600
Yeah, he's kind of immature,you know?

01:42.900 --> 01:43.800
oh.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.000
What's going on?

01:45.400 --> 01:46.800
Ashley said your light's been on for hours.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.200
What is Ashley doing up?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.200
<i>Twilight Zone</i> marathon.
Everything okay?

01:50.700 --> 01:51.800
She has school tomorrow.

01:52.100 --> 01:52.600
It's the weekend.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.600
It's not the weekend.
Tomorrow's Friday.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.000
No, actually it's today.
Today is Friday.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.600
Well, no one does anything
on Fridays, do they?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.700
Yes. It's the same
as any other school day.

02:01.900 --> 02:02.900
Not according to Ashley.

02:04.100 --> 02:04.900
I'm just kidding.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.800
We both fell asleep in the
living room at 7,woke up at 3,

02:07.800 --> 02:09.199
so we decided to get up.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.000
At 3:00?

02:10.100 --> 02:11.300
That's right.That's living the life.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.800
Going to be when you want
and going to bed when you want.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.600
What, are you rubbing it in?

02:14.700 --> 02:15.300
Rubbing what in?

02:16.500 --> 02:17.900
What's wrong? Who's sick?

02:18.300 --> 02:20.000
No one. John was crying.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
What was he crying about?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.000
He just cries.He's a baby, okay?

02:24.300 --> 02:25.400
Okay with me.I don't live here.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
Hey, is anybody hungry?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.900
How about a scrambled eggs
and bacon sandwich? Hash browns?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.200
Mmm.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.900
- You got eggs and bacon?--
- Everything's right where it's always been.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.200
Like he can get through to
where everything's always been.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.600
Why's this place
so messed up all the time?

02:36.800 --> 02:39.700
Because I'm in high school
and I work. Mom works, too.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.500
Well, you've got three hours
before you leave for school.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.600
You could clean now.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.500
I didn't go to bed at 7.I'm tired.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.500
Oh, and crabby.Don't forget crabby.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.500
Yeah, you're crabby. Your mom's crabby.
Because you miss us, huh?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
- We miss Ashley.--
- You miss Ashley.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.100
Oh, thanks. You know,are you gonna
be like this for the next 18 years,

02:55.100 --> 02:57.500
or do you think you might start
enjoying the kid at some point?

02:57.700 --> 02:58.800
- Ashley!--
- Amy!

02:59.000 --> 02:59.900
- George!--
- Anne!

03:00.100 --> 03:01.900
I think she has a point.
Ashley has a point.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.900
Sooner or later, Ames,
you gotta start enjoying life again.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.100
John can tell you're not happy
and that's why he cries.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.400
Get happy.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.400
And how am I supposed to do that?

03:10.700 --> 03:12.000
I think I'm gonna throw up.

03:12.700 --> 03:13.800
And then I'm gonna go back to bed.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.000
Good night.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.700
I'm gonna go back to bed, too.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.300
Just leave my egg sandwich
on a plate in the microwave.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.200
No bacon for me.
But I'll take the potatoes.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Thanks, Dad. 

03:26.300 --> 03:27.800
They're a mess,the two of 'em.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.800
Nothing we can do about that.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.000
Sure there is.
We can clean up some of this mess.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.200
And tomorrow we can find
some way to get Amy's mood up.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.200
Make her laugh or something.
She's gotta lighten up.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Get happy.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.700
And Mom? Are we gonna
try and make her happy, too?

03:40.900 --> 03:42.700
That's not my job anymore.
That's David's job.

03:42.900 --> 03:43.600
Is it?

03:43.700 --> 03:45.400
He's her boyfriend.
He's the father of her baby.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.500
Oh, yeah?
Why, what do you know?

03:47.900 --> 03:48.800
What do you know?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.300
Nothin.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.900
I don't mind hanging out again.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.500
We hang out every night.
I'm tired of hanging out.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.100
But I'm too tired to do
anything but hang out.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.700
<i>Then we can go to dinner.</i>

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
We can take John with us.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.800
No, we can't take John with us.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.800
I'm not taking him out
until he's three months old.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
You took him to the doctor's office.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.600
Could a restaurant be more germy
than a doctor's office?

04:30.800 --> 04:33.300
That's not the point.
I don't want to take any chances.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.900
Can Ricky or your mother
or your sister babysit?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.900
I doubt it.They all have lives.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.500
<i>Then we'll just hang out.</i>
And I'll bring over dinner.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.700
Or we can try cooking dinner.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.500
After I get home from work,
we're going to cook dinner?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.200
Well, we have to eat, don't we?

04:47.300 --> 04:48.400
We have to learn how to cook.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.700
I'll just, uh--
I'll talk to you at school.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.100
I gotta get up,
or I'm gonna be late.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.200
All right. I'll see you at school.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.000
- Hi.--
- Hi.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.300
Didn't mean to overhear,but

05:03.300 --> 05:04.300
I thought we should talk.

05:05.300 --> 05:09.000
Yeah,I've been trying to talk to you.
but every time I see you,you're with Betty.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.300
I have spent a lot of time
with Betty this week.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.200
I needed to spend a lot of time
with Betty this week.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.300
uh,I needed to be around another adult.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.700
Someone I could talk to.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.200
About me?

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Listen, Dad, I'm sorry
about quitting the butcher shop.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.400
I tried to go back, you know.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.400
I know.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
But you wanted to make it on your own,
and there's nothing really wrong with that.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.600
I took what I had,
and I turned it into something more--

05:37.800 --> 05:40.100
not just for me but for my family.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.500
You want to start from nothing?
Start from nothing.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.400
Go ahead.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.800
Dad, I said I was sorry.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.300
I know.And I'm sorry,too.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.000
I'm sorry I let a week go by
before telling you

05:49.000 --> 05:51.900
that's not how you leave a job
that someone's given you.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.900
Yeah. Not just someone,but you.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.500
Yeah, me.The guy who
loves you most in the world.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.300
Dad, I'm sorry, and...

05:59.500 --> 06:01.200
Can I have my job back?
Please?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.700
You sure you want your job back?

06:03.100 --> 06:04.100
I need a job.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.500
A job isn't easy to get.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.800
- Have you been looking?--
- Not really.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.300
I was hoping you'd forgive me
and give me my job back.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.000
Forgive you for...

06:12.100 --> 06:15.800
For sounding like it was a burden to have
the privilege of growing up with money

06:16.000 --> 06:19.300
and certain opportunities,like
having a family business to work at.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.000
Even when you're not that good at it.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.000
Good answer.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.200
I like that answer.
You can have your job back.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.100
And I have a proposal for you.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.500
Okay, great.I'll do
whatever you ask of me.

06:29.500 --> 06:35.600
But please realize that I'm not that
good at handling meat or knives or blood.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.300
You're good with customers.
That's what Bunny told me.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.300
You're good at remembering
what customers like,

06:40.300 --> 06:43.300
while,whether it's at the counter
or repeat mail order.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.400
- I am?--
- Yep.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.500
So I've been thinking.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.300
How would you like to
go to Italy this summer?

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
To Bologna?

06:48.900 --> 06:49.700
On a vacation?

06:49.900 --> 06:51.800
No, to work.
We have family there.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.800
I went there the summer
before I met your mother when I was 13.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.900
It was a blast.I loved it.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
What would I do there?

06:58.100 --> 07:01.200
Work at your uncle's hotel.
It's a small hotel,very nice.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.800
But I bet you'd be really
good with the clientele.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.200
They got a lot of Americans.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.100
Me go to Bologna and work at a hotel?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.500
Yeah.I think it'll be
good for you to get away.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.300
Could Amy and John go with me?

07:12.500 --> 07:15.000
I think that'd be really good for Amy
to get away from everything.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.600
I mean,she's really stressed right now.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.400
I'll have to ask, but...

07:18.900 --> 07:21.100
Do you really want to take
Amy and the baby with you?

07:21.300 --> 07:23.400
You think it might be good
to have a couple of months to

07:23.400 --> 07:25.800
just have some time to yourself?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.500
I'd think about that, Ben.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.400
You have your whole life
to spend with Amy and John.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.400
And she might be just as stressed
in Bologna as she is here.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.200
Maybe more so since you'll be
the only one there to help her out.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
Yeah, maybe.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.000
I'll miss ya,
but I think it'll do you good.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.700
And you have Betty here,
so you'd be okay, right?

07:43.800 --> 07:44.900
More than okay.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.300
Oh, by the way,
does Betty know the Bowmans?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.400
Does she know Grace's brother?
He seemed to recognize her at the funeral.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.600
She's very friendly,Betty.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.000
Tom, you didn't have to
cook again this morning.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.100
I was trying to get down here early
so I could cook for you.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.800
What's the matter?
Are you tuff of my cooking?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.200
No, not at all, honey.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.000
I just need to do something.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.900
I need to be busy.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.400
I'm feeling a little blue.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.700
Still?

08:23.000 --> 08:23.900
Still.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.400
I think it's gonna take me
longer than a week.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.500
It might take me longer than a year.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.700
It might take me a lifetime.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.400
Don't get me wrong.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.900
I miss Dad.

08:35.299 --> 08:38.000
But as Pocahontas said,

08:38.400 --> 08:39.799
all must die.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.500
You know, Tom,
that's not exactly comforting

08:43.900 --> 08:45.000
at a time like this.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.900
All must die?

08:47.100 --> 08:48.200
But it's true.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.600
We all die sometime.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.500
And you know he went to heaven.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.400
And you know you will see him again.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.200
Have a little faith.

08:58.300 --> 09:02.300
Honey, I'm gonna need more than a little
faith to be where you are with this.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.700
You have been really strong.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.700
Grace.

09:11.000 --> 09:11.900
Good morning.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.700
You look beautiful,sweetheart.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.000
Yes, you do.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.500
What happened?

09:16.600 --> 09:19.500
I don't know.I just decided
I'm gonna go to school today.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.300
It's Friday.
If you want to wait until Monday.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.500
That'll be okay.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.500
I was thinking today that maybe
we could all go talk to Reverend Stone.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.900
You know, just kind of check in with
where we are,where we want to be,

09:30.500 --> 09:32.900
how we want to handle things.
Get help if we need it.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.800
- Talk.--
- You and Tom can go.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.900
I'm fine.
I don't need to talk to anybody.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.900
I'm-- I'm better now.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.200
Honey, we could talk
to someone else if you'd like.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.000
He gave me the name
of a family grief therapist

09:43.000 --> 09:45.700
who wrote a really good book
on family and loss.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.500
I don't really want to grieve
according to some book.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm okay.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.500
I want to go back to school.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.300
I want to be busy,really.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.700
- Really?--
- Yeah.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.900
I know it's gonna be hard,
but I have to go back to school sometime.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.500
And instead of waiting until Monday,
I just thought I'd start now

10:01.500 --> 10:03.300
so at least I have the weekend

10:03.800 --> 10:06.300
before my second day back,
in case today doesn't go so great.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.100
Yeah, you're probably
going to need the weekend.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.300
Well, you're doing okay.
Why shouldn't I do okay?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.800
Because I didn't do anything,

10:15.200 --> 10:18.000
so I don't have any guilt.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.500
- Tom.--
- No, that's okay.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.400
There's going to be plenty of that
when I go back to school.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.000
But you know what?

10:23.800 --> 10:24.600
I can do it.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.500
There's only a month left of school
and I can get through it.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.700
I can.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.200
I don't know how,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.900
but I know God will find
a way to get me through.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.800
Then go.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.700
I will.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.300
Have a little faith, remember?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.100
We all just have to have
a little bit of faith.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.200
You'll be fine. We'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.200
Eventually.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.300
I mean, besides,
we can't wait until I'm 100%.

10:50.500 --> 10:54.100
I don't know when I'll be 100%.
It could be years.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.800
So I'm just gonna go get my stuff.

10:57.600 --> 11:05.100
Does the guy who wrote the book on grief
talk about using internet hookers?

11:05.300 --> 11:06.100
What?

11:06.500 --> 11:09.200
I saw Betty at the funeral.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.900
She dropped Ben off at the church.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.800
I was thinking maybe--

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
No! Absolutely not.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.600
I was just trying to make you laugh.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.200
Oh.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.500
Okay, Tom, that was good.You got me.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.000
But were joking about
Betty dropping off Ben?

11:27.100 --> 11:28.300
What, Ben and Betty?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.000
Yep.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.700
Hello?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.900
Good morning.This is Ben Boykewich.
<i>Is this Adrian?</i>

11:45.100 --> 11:46.300
Hey, Ben. What's up?

11:46.700 --> 11:47.700
I was just, uh--

11:48.200 --> 11:50.700
- I was wondering if--
- Oh, I'm not having sex with you.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.700
<i>Give Amy time.</i>

11:51.900 --> 11:53.200
Like in a couple of years,

11:53.200 --> 11:56.100
when she graduates high school,
<i>then she'll have sex with you.</i>

11:56.800 --> 11:57.900
Probably.

11:57.900 --> 12:01.300
Uh, no, no. I wasn't gonna
ask you to have sex.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.900
Although sex with you
would be very nice, I'm sure.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.700
Yeah, you can be sure of that.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.200
<i>What are you so nervous about?</i>

12:08.400 --> 12:10.200
Are you sure you weren't
gonna try and have sex with me?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.300
No, I wasn't calling you for sex.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.300
I just, uh--
I need some advice.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.000
About sex?

12:16.200 --> 12:18.600
No! No!
<i>I'm not having sex.</i>

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Not going to have sex until Amy is
absolutely,positively ready to have sex.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.100
And I love her,so I'll wait.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.400
I'll wait as long as I have to wait.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.000
<i>And, as you pointed out,</i>
<i>it could be a long time from now.</i>

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
It could be after high school.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.700
Way after high school, even.
After college. I mean...

12:35.400 --> 12:39.600
And whenever we do have sex£¬
I'm sure it'll have been worth the wait.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.000
- Or not.--
- <i>Anyway,here's the thing,</i>

12:42.000 --> 12:44.600
I don't really want
anyone else to know about this.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.500
Oh, whoa.
That's what guys always say.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.000
Are you sure you're not
trying to have sex with me?

12:49.100 --> 12:53.100
No. I would never try
because I don't want to try and fail.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.500
I would fail, right?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.900
- Probably.Yes.--
- Could I get a definitely?

13:00.400 --> 13:01.800
Just for the record in case

13:02.200 --> 13:04.900
the idea ever popped in my head
or anything.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.800
- Definitely.--
- Okay.

13:07.900 --> 13:11.500
So it's just that I don't know
how to present this opportunity 

13:11.500 --> 13:15.300
to Amy in a way that
she won't want to jump on it.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.200
Spit it out.
I have to get to school.

13:17.300 --> 13:20.200
I have an opportunity to go to
Bologna, Italy, this summer,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.500
- and I was--
- Interesting.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.500
You know what Bologna's known for, right?

13:25.700 --> 13:26.700
Bolognese sauce?

13:26.900 --> 13:29.900
Ha,ha,And other things.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.600
I don't know what Bologna is known for, no.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.100
We have relatives there.
<i>It's just that if I tell Amy</i>

13:35.100 --> 13:37.600
<i>that she and the baby could go with me,</i>
I'm sure they'd want to go,

13:37.600 --> 13:41.100
and honestly,I think it's best if they don't.
<i>It would be really difficult</i>

13:41.100 --> 13:43.100
to be in Italy and not have sex with Amy.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.800
Oh, don't you mean it would be
difficult to be in Italy with Amy

13:45.800 --> 13:47.400
and have sex with someone other than Amy?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.200
No! No, I do not.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.600
Honestly, I don't think it's the right time
for Amy and I to go away right now.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.500
And yet I don't want to hurt her feelings.
So I figured, hey, you're a woman.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.600
Maybe you could tell me.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.200
What should I say to Amy
so that she doesn't hate me?

14:02.700 --> 14:05.400
- Is Ricky going with you?--
- What? Ricky? No.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.400
So he'd be here with Amy for the summer.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.500
The two of them alone without you?

14:11.200 --> 14:12.100
Yeah.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.200
Then I hate you.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.700
Amy! We have to leave now!
We're late!

14:29.400 --> 14:30.400
What happened in here?

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
Dad cleaned up.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.300
Those your pajamas?
You go to work like that?

14:34.300 --> 14:36.400
No, I'm gonna drive
Amy and John like this.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.500
Unless...

14:39.800 --> 14:41.700
Oh, I can do it. I don't mind helping.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.800
I've tried to help as much
as you two will let anyone help.

14:44.200 --> 14:44.800
Thank you.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.800
I could really use
some more time to get ready.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
- How you feeling?--
- Better.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.200
Much better.Thank you.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.100
Won't you see if there's
anything you can do for Amy.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.400
Yeah, why don't I?
And you two can talk.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.400
Talk about what?

14:58.900 --> 14:59.700
Oh, I don't know.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
Are you getting a dog?

15:02.800 --> 15:04.500
Is that what Ashley
wants us to talk about?

15:05.000 --> 15:05.600
A dog?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.600
You're getting a dog.
I knew it.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.200
George, you don't need a dog.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.300
If you get a dog,
you're not gonna be able to travel

15:11.300 --> 15:13.200
or go anywhere without
having to worry about the dog.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.400
That would be true if I weren't
living next door to my ex-wife,

15:15.400 --> 15:16.800
who I'm sure would be
happy to take care of the dog

15:16.800 --> 15:17.700
when I'm not here.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
You love dogs, right?
If you got a dog,

15:18.800 --> 15:20.600
I'd be willing to keep
you dog when you travel.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.700
- You and David.--
- David doesn't like dogs.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.300
Does he like children?
I hope he likes children.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.800
Yeah, he likes children.

15:25.900 --> 15:30.300
But we can't take care of our baby
and Amy and Amy's baby and your dog,

15:30.300 --> 15:32.100
so if that's your plan,think again.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.800
- We're totally overwhelmed here.--
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.900
Look, I appreciate you cleaning up.
I do.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.400
Not enough to take care
of your dog for you in return,

15:39.400 --> 15:40.300
but I do appreciate it.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
Tell me something.
Where is your boyfriend?

15:42.800 --> 15:44.300
Why isn't he around here helping out?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.700
It's not his grandson.
It's our grandson.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.400
I'm sure it'll be different
when it's his baby.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.100
Will it?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.800
I didn't see him here last night
holding your hair back

15:50.800 --> 15:52.100
when you were puking your guts out.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.200
That's what I used to do.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.400
He's not even doing what I used to do,
and I thought I set the bar
pretty low back then.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.600
He just got back from a trip last night,
and he had to go to a job site.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.800
Anyway, I'm older now.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.000
I've been through this before.
I can take care of myself.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.300
Uh-huh.I can see that.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.100
Did he call,see how you were?

16:06.300 --> 16:07.200
I'm fine.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.300
It's just the sight
of bacon that did me in.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.100
Raw pig fat and pregnancy
don't mix for me.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.400
What are you getting at,anyway?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.800
What I'm getting at,
is just because this guy is the guy 

16:15.800 --> 16:18.000
who got you pregnant,it doesn't mean
he's the right guy for you.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.100
Any more than Ricky
is the right guy for Amy.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.300
Well, he's not Ricky.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, he is Ricky.And I'm Ben.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.400
Or I would be Ben
if we were still in love.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
But we're not.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.500
It wouldn't make any difference if we were.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.200
It's too late now,because unlike Ben,

16:30.400 --> 16:33.400
I'm not really interested in being the boyfriend
to a girl who's having another boy's baby.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.900
That was always the problem, wasn't it?

16:34.900 --> 16:37.900
I was always just another one of your
girlfriends,not really your wife.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.300
Let's go to school!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.400
Sorry about your dad.
And the other thing,you know.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.300
I know just how you feel.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.900
I lost my cat last year.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.300
And my virginity.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.200
My dad almost died, too.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.900
It's okay.I got your back.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.400
Look, I know you haven't called me.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.300
I know you haven't felt
like calling anyone.

17:11.300 --> 17:11.900
But

17:12.400 --> 17:14.200
- we're still friends--
- Grace!

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Hi,What's going on?

17:21.400 --> 17:24.099
What's going on is your boyfriend
is going to Italy this summer.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.100
Grace!

17:48.800 --> 17:50.300
Grace, it's me, George.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.800
George Juergens.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.400
Grace?

17:57.800 --> 17:58.800
Are you okay?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.700
Oh, it's okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.400
Grace, it's okay.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.800
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.000
Better?

18:17.300 --> 18:18.500
You want to talk?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.200
Did someone say something
to you at school?

18:23.900 --> 18:25.200
You wanna tell me what they said?

18:27.700 --> 18:29.200
First day back, huh?

18:31.400 --> 18:32.500
You know, there's only
a month left of school.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.900
Why don't you just stay home for now
and go to summer school?

18:35.300 --> 18:36.200
I can't.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.100
My mom said if I stay home
I have to talk to somebody.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.500
Sometimes it's good to talk to someone.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.700
On the other hand, I'm not really big
on talking to people about my problems.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.200
You have problems?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.800
Well, not like your problems.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.500
Maybe the opposite of your problems.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.700
Yeah, your problems can't be
as bad as my problems.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.600
Nah, no one's d--

18:59.400 --> 19:00.300
Dad?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm sorry, Grace.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.200
I know you were really close to your dad.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.900
I just want to know where he is.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.500
He's dead, Grace.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.900
Yeah, but dead dead?
Or is he in heaven somewhere?

19:15.200 --> 19:15.800
Where is heaven?

19:16.800 --> 19:17.700
I don't know.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.700
But I'm pretty sure there is one.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.100
So you believe in God?

19:21.300 --> 19:21.800
Of course.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.500
You don't have to go
to church to believe in God.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.200
Or you can go to church
and not believe in God.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.000
Do you believe in God?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.800
I thought I did it.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.700
But then he killed your dad?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.800
Yeah,I don't think it works like that.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
I know it doesn't work like that.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.000
And if it does work like that,
well, then, darn it,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.400
God, strike me dead!

19:45.600 --> 19:46.800
See? Nothing.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.300
And my daughter had sex
with someone she hardly even knew..

19:51.000 --> 19:52.500
So did my wife,for that matter.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.500
If your dad was alive,

19:56.100 --> 19:57.500
he'd get over you having sex with Jack.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.400
He might have gotten upset about it,
but he would have gotten over it.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.000
He was a nice guy, your dad.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.800
Not that I knew him.
But that's what people say.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.700
"Nice guy, Dr. Bowman."

20:08.300 --> 20:09.900
He was the nicest.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.200
I just don't know why I
couldn't do what he told me to do

20:13.400 --> 20:15.200
or not do what he told me not to do.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.800
it's tough to do the right thing.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.400
Believe me, I've been there.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.100
It's tough to forgive Jack.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.500
Tough to forgive Adrian.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.600
Even tougher to forgive yourself.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.300
Yeah.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.400
You just got to forget everything that
could have been or should have been.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.900
Forget everything.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.200
but how much you love Jack
and how much you love Adrian.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.500
Because in the end,
all we need is love.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.000
- Beatles.
- Beatles.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.600
I just don't know
if I can love them like I did.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.800
I guess what happened isn't their fault.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.900
No, it's not.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.900
And you know, Jack feels so bad
about it, he started drinking.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.900
He was drinking at your dad's funeral.
He's heartbroken.

20:53.700 --> 20:56.700
- Wait, Jack is drinking alcohol?
- Yeah. I told him to lay off.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.300
That's been done. Teen and alcohol.
He should try teen and sober.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.600
Teen and no alcohol
or drugs or even sex.

21:02.700 --> 21:05.000
I don't think Jack can go without sex.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.200
So that's how it happened.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.600
Trying to keep him away
from all the other girls, huh?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.600
Well, I got news for you.
Guys aren't animals.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.600
They're not completely
ruled by their hormones.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.300
They're animals with brains.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.900
They can be trained to go without sex
for long periods of time.

21:18.300 --> 21:21.100
Just ask any guy who's been
married for a few years and has kids.

21:21.900 --> 21:22.800
You're funny.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.000
I wish my Amy thought so.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.600
I can't even get her to smile these days.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.000
Mr. Juergens, you really
helped me by talking to me.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.100
I feel a lot better. I really do.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.200
Do you want to tell me
what your problem is?

21:35.400 --> 21:37.100
It might help. I'm a good listener.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.700
And it might make me feel
better to help somebody else.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.200
Especially you, 'cause you were
so kind to listen to me.

21:43.000 --> 21:43.900
All right.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.000
I told my wife I got
a certain surgery when I didn't.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Now she thinks she's
pregnant by her boyfriend.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.100
Oh, my.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
Yeah.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.000
Pray for me.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.500
I was going to tell you.
I just wasn't ready to tell you.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.500
How did she know?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.300
- Who?
- Who?

22:10.300 --> 22:12.000
Did you tell people other than Adrian?

22:12.100 --> 22:14.200
Oh, no, Adrian. Yeah, I told her.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.200
I wanted to ask her advice about how
to tell you so that I didn't upset you.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.100
Why would you be getting
advice from Adrian?

22:19.500 --> 22:20.900
Oh, I'll tell you why.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.400
Because you were hoping to
get more than advice from Adrian.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.900
No, that's not true.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.900
It's just you've been kind of...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.700
tired and not in the best mood.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.000
And I didn't want to upset you.
And she's very mature, Adrian.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.700
Oh, yeah, right.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.500
Amy, I love you.
But my uncle needs me.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.200
Your uncle in Bologna?

22:39.600 --> 22:40.700
- Baloney!
- No, no, no.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.000
My uncle runs a small hotel there,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.400
and he really needs me to come
in and work for him this summer.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.500
It's a family thing.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.700
I can make more money there
than at the butcher shop.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.800
And all I have to sacrifice
is seeing you and John every day

22:51.800 --> 22:54.100
for a few weeks--
a couple months, tops.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.200
Couldn't your dad just give
you a raise at the butcher shop?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.400
Yeah, he could, but honestly,
why would he?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.700
Other than I'm his son.
I'm not that good at it.

23:01.100 --> 23:04.700
Amy, you know I want to invest some
time in me and finding myself.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.100
I want to be my own man.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
And maybe I'll find
something in Bologna,

23:08.500 --> 23:11.300
something in my uncle's business
that's right for me.

23:11.300 --> 23:14.300
Something that I can use my whole life
that will benefit the two of us.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.600
I can't believe you'd
just take off for the summer.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.200
Well, you could go too, but--

23:19.200 --> 23:20.100
Really?

23:20.300 --> 23:22.300
Well, I mean, if you
could take John with you.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.900
??You'd have to take
John out of the country,

23:23.900 --> 23:25.500
and you don't even want to
take John out of the house.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.800
Then I'll just leave John here.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.900
He won't miss me for a few weeks.
He's too young.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.600
But you just couldn't
go off and leave him.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.900
Well, it wouldn't be like
I was going off and leaving him.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.700
I have a family.
My family could help out.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.400
Even if it's just for like a month.
I really need to get away.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
What's up with those two?

23:45.700 --> 23:46.900
Ben's going to Bologna.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.000
Italy?

23:48.800 --> 23:51.000
Leaving you here for
the summer, alone with Amy.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.200
Amy and John. Not Amy.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.200
Why Bologna? I've never
heard him mention Bologna.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.100
Well, he has an uncle
he can work for there,

23:58.100 --> 24:00.600
but I don't think he's going for work.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.100
Bologna's known for three things.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.100
1, it's known for having the
oldest university in the world.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.300
2, it's known for its incredible food.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.800
And 3, it's known for oral sex.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.800
Come on. Every city
in Europe is known for sex.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.500
Same in Asia. Every place but America.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.100
No one seems to come here
to America for sex.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.700
Not willingly, anyway.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.900
So Ben's dad is sending him
to Italy to get...

24:25.200 --> 24:26.100
Yeah.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.500
Maybe I can go, too.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.300
You can get that right here.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.300
- So can he.
- Oh, what, from me?

24:33.300 --> 24:34.500
No, not from you.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.500
You're not the only girl
in this school having sex.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.000
Half the girls here are having sex.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.100
Yeah, and half are not. Like Amy.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.300
Let me ask you something.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.100
Are you having sex
with anyone other than me?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.100
- What?
- Wrong answer.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.700
Wai-- You're not available.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.100
My dad's trying to
get back together with my mom.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.700
They're looking at houses.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.200
And when we get a house,
we can have our privacy back.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.200
- And until then?
- Until then you can wait.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.800
And if you can't wait, then...

25:02.400 --> 25:04.800
then don't come back around
when we do get a house.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.000
And I mean that.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.300
Go. Go with him. Go to Bologna!

25:09.300 --> 25:14.100
Have sex that's named after
rigatoni and spaghettini and fusilli.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.700
What do I care?

25:19.400 --> 25:20.500
What?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.300
It's nice to have you back
so quickly, you know.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.100
You just got to get back up on the horse.

25:36.300 --> 25:39.600
Oh, I'm referring to your dad,
not the other thing.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.000
Thanks for clarifying that.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.400
It's always hard to know
what to say, isn't it?

25:44.700 --> 25:46.700
I really appreciate
what you're trying to do.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.100
It's really nice that people care,
that you care.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.400
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Grace.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.800
I didn't know if you
were speaking to me or not.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.400
Yeah, I'm speaking to you.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.400
I'm speaking to everybody.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.600
I'm really sorry about
the way I've been acting.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.500
Oh, no, no. Don't apologize to me.
I was totally in the wrong here.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.000
Wrong not to wait. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.100
No, the two of us made this decision.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.300
And I think it was
a bad decision. I really do.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.800
Even though you're the guy for me,
and I love you, Jack,

26:25.800 --> 26:28.900
I had sex with you because I didn't want
you to have sex with anybody else.

26:29.100 --> 26:32.100
Grace, if you'll have me back,
I swear I'll never have sex again.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.100
Even when we're married?

26:34.400 --> 26:36.200
You still care enough
about me to marry me?

26:36.300 --> 26:38.200
Yes, of course I do.

26:38.300 --> 26:41.100
But you have to stop with
the drinking thing right now.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.300
Mr. Juergens told me.

26:43.700 --> 26:44.900
It was just beer.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.100
I thought a couple beers would
make it easier to get over you.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.300
And over losing you and your dad.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.000
And my dad, for that matter.

26:53.700 --> 26:56.300
I thought I was over that, but I--

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
I don't think
I'm ever gonna be over that--

26:59.700 --> 27:00.700
losing my dad.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.900
I still think about him all the time.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.500
It's just been really painful lately and...

27:05.700 --> 27:06.600
I'm sorry.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.800
You're the only person that can say
"I know what you're going through"

27:08.800 --> 27:09.800
and really mean it.

27:09.800 --> 27:13.200
But I don't know if I can really say that.
I don't know what it's been like for you.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.900
I only know what it's like for me.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.500
And it's just been horrible.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.200
I mean, for me
and my mom and Tom and...

27:19.500 --> 27:21.400
I just made it so much more horrible.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.900
But now I have to dig a little deeper
and find a little bit more strength

27:24.900 --> 27:27.100
and just do something
honorable for my dad.

27:27.800 --> 27:28.500
And other than that,

27:28.500 --> 27:31.700
I just don't think there's anything
else we can do about losing our dads.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.100
But there is something
we can do about losing us.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.900
I don't want to lose what we had.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.800
And I'm in love with you, Jack.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.400
And I want to be your girlfriend.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.800
I just don't want to
have sex again until I'm married.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.700
And I expect you not to have
sex again until we're married.

27:49.700 --> 27:52.000
- Any kind of sex.
- I promise.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.100
I won't have any kind
of sex until we're married.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.800
I'd do anything for you, Grace.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.000
- And no drinking.
- No drinking.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.600
- No drugs.
- No drugs.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Just us.

28:01.800 --> 28:02.900
That's enough for me.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.400
Can I give you a ride home?

28:07.500 --> 28:08.600
I'd like that.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.300
Thank you.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.400
So you're going to Italy to have sex, huh?

28:27.400 --> 28:30.200
Going all the way out of
the country just to have sex.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.600
Not even real sex. More like foreplay.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.500
I don't know that for sure.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.800
Oh, yeah, you do.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.400
You know, I can help you get laid here.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.600
It's not about sex, okay?

28:38.600 --> 28:41.400
It's not about anything
other than getting a summer job.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.700
A summer job, huh?

28:42.800 --> 28:44.600
Come on, it's not about work.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.500
It's about running away
from your responsibilities

28:46.500 --> 28:47.800
and getting rewarded for it.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.100
I thought you'd be happy I'm going.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.600
I thought you'd be happy to
have Amy and the baby all to yourself.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.100
Amy said you asked her to go with you,

28:53.100 --> 28:55.300
so you'll have Amy
and the baby to yourself.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.900
Oh, yeah. I did ask.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.600
I don't know if they're going, though.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.200
- I mean, I'd like for them to go, but--
- No, you wouldn't like for her to go.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.800
I talked to Adrian, too, you know.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.100
And why are you going
to Adrian for advice?

29:08.100 --> 29:09.900
Because I wanted
a woman's point of view.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.800
And I thought she wouldn't tell anyone.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.200
Why didn't you talk to your friend?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.300
What's her name, Alice?

29:14.300 --> 29:16.600
Oh, because Alice only knows
what she reads in books,

29:16.600 --> 29:19.600
and Adrian's got some
real-life experience. That's why.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.200
And that's what you want,
Some real-life experience?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.400
You stay away from Adrian.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.200
Stay away as in
don't even talk to Adrian?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.800
- Because...
- Because.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.900
Because you have real feelings for her?

29:30.900 --> 29:33.500
Because you don't need to
have sex with anyone other than Amy

29:33.500 --> 29:35.500
when Amy is ready to have sex.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.400
Which isn't gonna be anytime soon.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.600
I don't need you to tell me when
I can or cannot have sex with Amy.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.100
Amy'll decide that.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.200
And what, I don't need sex, but you do?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.500
It's not a matter of need.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.500
I'm not having sex because I need sex.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.800
I'm having sex
because I want to have sex.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.800
Well, yeah, I want to have sex, too.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.700
Hello, Ben.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.200
Oh, excuse me for interrupting,

29:57.200 --> 30:00.300
but your dad said I could
drop by and pick up some steaks.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.900
We're grilling out tonight.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.700
Hi. You must be Ricky.

30:04.700 --> 30:08.300
Oh, I'm sorry. Betty, this is Ricky.
Ricky, Betty.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.300
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.100
this is my dad's fiancée.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.400
Yeah, that's French for betrothed.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
I didn't know
Mr. Boykewich was betrothed.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.100
Congratulations to him.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.600
I think it's "best wishes"
to the future bride.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.100
Oh, I didn't know that.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.400
I have a lot of useless
information in my head.

30:25.400 --> 30:29.200
Lucky you. I can't seem to
keep any information in my head.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.000
I have to write everything down.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.600
That's four steaks, all right?

30:33.100 --> 30:34.200
Yeah, right.

30:36.200 --> 30:39.400
I'm just so surprised Ben didn't
tell me about you and his dad.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.000
Oh, well, that's not Ben's fault, really.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.800
It's just we've been trying to
keep it quiet until we can find my dog.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.000
I hear you're going to Bologna.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.100
Maybe, yeah.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.900
I've never been to Bologna.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.400
Have you ever been to Bologna, Betty?

30:53.400 --> 30:56.100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Lots of times.

30:56.100 --> 31:00.300
It's beautiful, and the people
are really, really friendly.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.900
And there's-- there's
spaghetti all over the place.

31:03.900 --> 31:05.500
What's Bologna known for?

31:05.700 --> 31:08.000
Everyone knows
what Bologna's known for.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.500
- I don't.
- Ricky.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.700
The Leaning Tower of Pizza.

31:13.100 --> 31:13.800
Betty.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.300
All right, Benjamin, no.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.700
I was just making a dumb blonde joke.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.300
I was just kidding around.

31:20.300 --> 31:23.300
Everyone knows
what Bologna is known for.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.700
- How about my steaks?
- Yeah.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.500
Bye, boys.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.600
- Is she--
- Court reporter!

31:37.800 --> 31:40.700
Or so she says.
I don't know. I don't ask questions.

31:40.700 --> 31:41.800
It's none of my business.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.400
My dad loves her.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.600
- Betty?
- Yeah, Betty.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.400
Betty.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.300
Where have I heard that name before?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.600
She gave me a ride
to the funeral last week.

31:51.600 --> 31:55.300
She waved to Grace's brother Tom.
She seemed to know him somehow.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.400
- What?
- Nothing.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.400
Hi, Mom.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.100
Welcome home.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.400
Did you make dinner?

32:18.500 --> 32:20.700
- A real dinner?
- It's just a chicken.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.400
Dad let me help out
at the grocery store.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.700
And I'm making rice and a salad.

32:24.900 --> 32:27.800
And you managed to do all
that and keep the house clean?

32:27.900 --> 32:30.300
- Yeah.
- I'm really impressed, Amy.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.600
It's really nice to come home
to a clean house and dinner.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.000
You did it for us for how many years?

32:36.500 --> 32:37.300
15.

32:37.300 --> 32:41.100
So I just tried really hard to
do something nice in return for you.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.200
Why?

32:43.500 --> 32:46.700
Because I love you,
because you're my mom,

32:46.800 --> 32:48.700
and you're expecting.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.400
And would you mind watching John
It would just be for the summer.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.600
??

33:01.600 --> 33:04.000
I've never been to Italy.
I've always wanted to go to Italy.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah, me, too.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.200
- Why don't you take the baby with you?
- Yeah, there you go. Take John with you.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.900
Are you two out of your minds? I cannot
take a 10-week old baby with me to Italy.

33:11.100 --> 33:13.800
It's not like he doesn't know Mom.
She's with him every single day.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.500
She could just leave him at the nursery.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.100
Yeah, what about the nursery?
What would you do about your job?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.400
It's a pity job.
They don't really need me there.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.900
And Ashley could do it.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.700
I don't think so. It's your job.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.100
And you're my sister.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.800
And I'm too young to be tied down
with a baby for the rest of my life

33:28.800 --> 33:30.000
without a break!

33:31.100 --> 33:34.700
I need to get away, Dad.
I really need to get away.

33:35.100 --> 33:39.300
I'm tired of being locked up at home
with the baby, with John.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.500
I love him. I really love him.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.200
But I'm 15.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.300
Yeah, almost 16.
You got a birthday coming up.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.700
I know. And I would like to
spend it in Italy in Bologna with Ben.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.400
- That's where Ben is going?
- Why, what's wrong with Bologna?

33:52.500 --> 33:53.600
Nothing.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.500
- Hey. Steak's ready.
- I'll be right there.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.500
I just wanted to clean up before dinner.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.600
I think this is the first time
Betty's ever cooked dinner.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.900
She looks like she really
knows what to do with a grill.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.100
Surprised me.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.000
She seems like a really nice woman.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.900
Yeah. I'm a lucky man.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.100
Any luck getting her unhitched?

34:14.500 --> 34:15.400
Why?

34:15.699 --> 34:16.800
Oh, nothing.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.100
You gonna have a big wedding?

34:18.100 --> 34:20.100
Probably just something
here at the house.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.300
But don't worry,
we won't get married without you.

34:22.300 --> 34:25.199
Speaking of which, how are
your summer plans coming along?

34:25.199 --> 34:27.699
I mean, how'd it go with Amy?
Did you tell her about Bologna?

34:27.699 --> 34:32.000
Yeah. And I had to ask her if
she wanted to go or she'd kill me.

34:32.100 --> 34:34.000
Well, all right.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.600
Well, did you know
that Bologna's known for--

34:36.600 --> 34:38.000
Yes.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.900
Urban legend, probably.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.500
Yeah. I figured.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.300
You don't think
she'll actually go-- Amy?

34:43.300 --> 34:45.500
I really doubt
she'll be able to, but maybe.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.199
And you're gonna go
without her, if she can't go?

34:48.199 --> 34:49.100
Oh, yeah.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.900
I mean, such a great opportunity.

34:51.900 --> 34:55.300
Traveling abroad is more educational
than even going to school, right?

34:56.300 --> 34:57.300
It can be.

34:57.900 --> 34:58.700
Yeah.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.000
Thanks, Adrian.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.500
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.500
I like being with you.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.200
I'm sorry I can't stick around.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.600
Oh, that's okay.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.700
Ruben's picking my mom up at the
airport, and he'll be back soon.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.000
I convinced him it'd
be romantic to surprise her.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.500
What would be romantic
as far as you and I are concerned?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.300
- Why?
- Just askin'.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.100
I don't want romance.
It's not real.

35:27.700 --> 35:31.900
This-- This is real. Just two people
getting together to have sex.

35:32.100 --> 35:32.800
Yeah.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.100
Two people, no commitment.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.900
I want a commitment.

35:43.800 --> 35:47.000
I don't want you to have sex
with any other guys, especially Ben.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.200
I would never sleep with Ben.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.000
I don't want you to
sleep with Jack, either.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.100
I have no plans to sleep with Jack.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.900
What would make you think
I'd sleep with Jack?

35:54.900 --> 35:56.600
They're getting back together,
Grace and Jack.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.800
I saw them leaving school, holding hands.

35:59.100 --> 36:00.700
And she's not gonna
have sex with him again,

36:00.700 --> 36:02.500
and he's not gonna
be able to leave it alone.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.100
So I don't want you with Jack.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.300
Or Ben.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.900
All right.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.200
I have to go over to Amy's
and help her with John.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.200
Yeah, I know.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
I don't want you to have sex with Amy.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.900
I'm not gonna have sex with Amy.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.800
You're not even gonna try?

36:19.200 --> 36:20.900
With Ben in Italy for the summer?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.600
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

36:22.700 --> 36:23.800
Ben's my friend.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.700
So Ben's the reason? Not me.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.300
Look, I just asked you for a commitment.
What more do you want from me?

36:30.300 --> 36:32.000
Nothing. Nothing.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.000
Good night. I'll call you later.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
No, that's okay. You don't
have to if you don't want to.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.000
Oh, shoot.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.100
Adrian?

36:56.500 --> 36:59.500
Yeah, it's me, Grace.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.400
Sorry. I hit the speed dial

37:01.400 --> 37:03.600
before I remembered you didn't
want to be friends with me.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.800
No. I'm glad you hit the speed dial.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.500
I'm on your speed dial?

37:07.800 --> 37:12.500
- You're 1 on my speed dial.
- Really? That's so nice.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.400
I miss talking to you, Adrian.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.100
And I'm so sorry about what
I said to you at school today.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.800
I was so wrong.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.200
<i>Are you there?</i>

37:20.200 --> 37:22.000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I'm here.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.100
So we're still friends?

37:25.100 --> 37:27.500
Yeah, if you'll still have me as a friend.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.300
After the way I treated you,

37:29.300 --> 37:31.700
I don't even know why
you'd want to be my friend.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.700
Because you make me
feel like I'm somebody.

37:35.700 --> 37:37.200
You are somebody.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.200
<i>- I'm really sorry about your dad.
- Thanks, Adrian.</i>

37:41.500 --> 37:44.000
But I can't really talk about it
without completely losing it.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.200
So tell me what's going on with you.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.000
<i>Why'd you call?</i>

37:47.600 --> 37:51.700
Ricky just told me that he doesn't want
me to have sex with any other guys.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.700
That's great.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.200
<i>Did I tell you that
Jack and I are back together?</i>

37:57.200 --> 37:59.500
But we're not going to have sex again.

37:59.700 --> 38:00.900
Great. Yeah.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.000
And we're going to try
to be better Christians.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.200
Yeah. Me, too.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.900
I don't even know what that means.
But I'm just so excited to talk to you.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.300
How are you?

38:11.600 --> 38:13.300
<i>Is it just horrible?</i>

38:13.500 --> 38:15.200
Yeah. It's horrible.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.900
I feel like my heart exploded.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.000
I wish there was something I could do.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.100
It's completely unfair.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.600
Ricky gets to go anywhere he wants,

38:23.600 --> 38:26.000
and I have no time
at all without the baby.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.300
And once Mom's baby gets here,

38:27.300 --> 38:29.100
there's going to be
two babies in the house.

38:29.100 --> 38:32.200
I'm sure I'm going to
have to babysit for her and David.

38:32.500 --> 38:35.100
So why can't she just do
this one little thing for me,

38:35.100 --> 38:38.200
and let me go for-- I don't know--
two weeks, three weeks, a month?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.800
You two have been wanting a dog, right?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.600
If you keep John just for a few weeks,

38:42.600 --> 38:45.300
I promise I'll keep your dog
whenever you want to go out of town.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.600
Hey, here's a good idea.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.700
Why don't you just put John
in a kennel while you're gone?

38:52.100 --> 38:53.100
Hi.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.600
Your mom told me you were over here.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.000
Oh, I hope I'm not disturbing you.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.700
I would've stayed over there,
but that guy's over there-- David.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.400
Hey, there.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.600
Want to come with Daddy,
give Grandpa a break?

39:18.200 --> 39:20.200
You're really good with John.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.100
You're great with him.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.100
Well, I'm going to bed.

39:25.700 --> 39:29.100
I think this might be a good time for me to
go over and talk to your mom and David.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.700
I can't take him while you go to Italy.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.600
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're his mother.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.900
- You're his father.
- You have a job.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.200
You have a job.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.300
You can put him in the
nursery when you go to work.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.000
Let Ben go, Amy. Let him go.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.700
The guy's been really
good to you and to me.

39:47.700 --> 39:50.200
And if he wants to go away
for the summer, let him go.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.700
This is our son--
my son and your son.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.400
Ben's not obligated to take care of him.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.100
We are.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.600
Let Ben go, and let him go
without feeling bad about leaving.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.100
- He deserves that.
- No.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.700
If I let him go there by himself,

40:07.100 --> 40:08.600
he's going to get into trouble.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.300
He could get into trouble here.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.200
How did we get ourselves into this?

40:17.200 --> 40:18.200
Sex.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.100
Oh, sex.

40:28.700 --> 40:31.000
I'm sorry. She really tried.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.100
Yeah. I'm sorry she tried, too.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.600
There's something
I think I should tell you

40:35.600 --> 40:38.200
before we both collapse
from food poisoning.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.700
What's that?

40:40.500 --> 40:44.400
I-- I got a little
suspicious about the pregnancy.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.000
- Suspicious?
- I'm an only child.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.600
Infertility runs in my family.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.200
My first wife and I
had irreconcilable differences--

40:53.200 --> 40:55.500
differences of opinion
over whether we should try

40:55.500 --> 40:59.200
different methods to
conceive or to adopt.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.400
- That's why we split up.
- Yeah?

41:02.500 --> 41:07.500
Yeah, so, I made an appointment
with a doctor today

41:07.500 --> 41:10.000
to sort of have things checked out,

41:10.000 --> 41:14.600
thinking that maybe-- just maybe--
you were trying to trick me.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.100
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

41:17.400 --> 41:21.300
Maybe because I'm
the sole heir to a large fortune.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.800
I'm just being honest
with you. Completely honest.

41:25.800 --> 41:28.400
So you think I got pregnant
to get my hands on your money?

41:28.400 --> 41:30.600
It's not my money. It's my dad's money.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.600
And without an heir, they're
leaving it to medical research.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.500
And they want to be frozen.

41:36.700 --> 41:40.800
Yeah. You should meet them sometime.
They're two very special people.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.200
I don't want to meet them.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.300
And I think that you'd better leave.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.400
This is your baby.
And George has had a vasectomy.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.300
It's not his baby. It's your baby.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.500
But if you don't want to have
anything to do with me or my baby,

41:52.500 --> 41:53.600
that's your decision.

41:53.900 --> 41:56.000
But I'm not interested
in your parents' money.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.500
Or their factories?

41:57.800 --> 42:02.800
Or real estate? Or investments?
Or stock portfolios? Any of that?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.500
I don't know anything
about any of that!

42:04.500 --> 42:06.700
Again, I just am being
totally honest with you,

42:06.700 --> 42:09.200
and I hope you're being
honest with me, because, Anne,

42:09.500 --> 42:11.300
I love you, and I want to marry you,

42:11.300 --> 42:13.800
but we haven't known
each other that long,

42:13.800 --> 42:18.700
and I have to ask because my fathering
a child is a bit of a medical miracle.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.400
- Really?
- Really.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.300
Well, you didn't have to ask me
if I was some kind of con artist.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.400
Why didn't you just
have me investigated?

42:26.400 --> 42:27.500
- I did.
- What?

42:27.500 --> 42:28.800
I had to.

42:28.900 --> 42:29.900
Forgive me, Anne.

42:29.900 --> 42:33.300
It's just that I wanted to make sure
there wasn't something I wasn't seeing.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.800
I'm just so crazy about you.

42:35.900 --> 42:41.300
And if you don't mind, I was wondering
if you were open to a prenup?

42:41.300 --> 42:44.100
Well, what makes you think I'd even
want to marry you after all that?

42:44.100 --> 42:46.000
I don't know. But...

42:50.400 --> 42:52.200
Will you marry me?

43:03.500 --> 43:09.300
