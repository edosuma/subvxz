WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:06.093
Squad is an elite unit.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.443
<i>Cruz got very big shoes
to fill.</i>

00:08.443 --> 00:09.792
We got a change in personnel.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.141
We gotta make sure
that the gears are meshing.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.621
You like how he says, "we"?

00:12.621 --> 00:14.405
<i>No wonder Severide
hightailed it out of here.</i>

00:14.405 --> 00:16.016
My whole company
is falling apart

00:16.016 --> 00:17.321
because I can't handle
one joker.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.367
Don't second guess yourself, Cruz,

00:19.367 --> 00:22.022
because nobody else
second guesses you.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.849
Bamford, we lift
each other up.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.242
So you're gonna have to try
and do it our way

00:25.242 --> 00:27.505
while you're here.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.768
I got a construction gig
right after shift.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.379
Oh, I thought
you quit construction.

00:31.379 --> 00:35.383
<i>My brother cleaned me out,
so I need the cash.</i>

00:35.383 --> 00:38.342
Tomorrow is your
last chemo treatment.

00:38.342 --> 00:41.215
Cin, you deserve to celebrate.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.434
We're gonna do a party,
and it'll be

00:43.434 --> 00:46.394
when we get the news
that all this is really over.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.313
All doctors are the same.

00:52.313 --> 00:55.838
It's not your life,
so what does it really matter?

00:55.838 --> 00:57.492
Hey, what's going on?

00:57.492 --> 00:59.624
While you were in the shower,
Dr. Bishop's office called.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.757
They pushed today's appointment
to Friday.

01:01.757 --> 01:02.845
What?

01:02.845 --> 01:04.629
They said the
doctor was dealing

01:04.629 --> 01:06.196
with some kind of emergency
at the hospital,

01:06.196 --> 01:08.633
but still, four more days?

01:08.633 --> 01:11.288
We've barely been sleeping
waiting for this appointment,

01:11.288 --> 01:13.073
but what does Dr. Bishop care?

01:13.073 --> 01:16.946
He is not the one waiting
to be told if the chemo worked,

01:16.946 --> 01:19.731
or if the cancer has advanced,
or I'm just--

01:19.731 --> 01:20.906
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

01:20.906 --> 01:23.866
I know this is crazy-making,
all right?

01:23.866 --> 01:25.607
But hey, we can do it.

01:25.607 --> 01:28.088
Just gotta keep thinking
good thoughts, all right?

01:28.088 --> 01:31.265
I honestly don't think
I can do this.

01:31.265 --> 01:34.572
I just wanna go
burn down the hospital.

01:34.572 --> 01:38.185
The good news is,
if you do,

01:38.185 --> 01:40.056
I'll be first on scene.

01:42.102 --> 01:46.018
Well, hey, hey.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.805
All right, you're not
gonna burn anything down,

01:49.805 --> 01:54.331
and you are gonna
continue to be the warrior

01:54.331 --> 01:57.073
that you have been
through this whole thing.

01:57.073 --> 02:02.948
And we, we're gonna get
to that appointment, okay?

02:02.948 --> 02:04.080
Mm-hmm.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.787
Are you coming to my
basketball game tomorrow?

02:15.787 --> 02:19.313
How are you doing hockey and
basketball at the same time?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.357
That's a lot of games.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.750
Basketball is for school.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.273
Hockey isn't.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.188
You've missed so many.
Maybe you can come to this one?

02:25.188 --> 02:26.885
We play St. Hilda's.

02:26.885 --> 02:29.192
Their uniforms look like
Stormtrooper outfits,

02:29.192 --> 02:30.976
all white with black edges.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.152
It's so cool.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.979
Our uniforms suck.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.329
That's great.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.026
That our uniforms suck?

02:37.026 --> 02:38.636
- What?
- Nothing.

02:38.636 --> 02:42.553
Just can you come
to the game this time?

02:42.553 --> 02:45.165
I'm sorry, papito.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.689
No, I can't.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.517
There's so much work
to do at the firehouse

02:49.517 --> 02:51.083
now that I'm acting lieutenant.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.351
Okay, come on.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.483
We gotta--we gotta
get out of here.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.356
If I drop you off late,
your mom will kill me.

03:10.015 --> 03:13.236
I saw you sell your Bronco
the other day.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.543
This one
called your name instead?

03:15.543 --> 03:18.285
Well, when you said that
Bronco was the manliest car

03:18.285 --> 03:19.634
on the planet,
I realized I could get

03:19.634 --> 03:21.592
top dollar for it, so why not?

03:21.592 --> 03:24.421
Come on, why did you
let that hot car go?

03:24.421 --> 03:27.337
Pickups are easier
when you're doing construction.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.338
I've been taking
a lot more jobs lately,

03:28.338 --> 03:29.600
so it just made sense.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.906
Hmm.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.648
Well, pickups are good
for drive-in movies too.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.519
True fact.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.566
So Severide is enjoying
the arson program?

03:38.566 --> 03:40.350
He is.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.265
I can tell
he misses being here,

03:42.265 --> 03:43.832
but I know he's not
gonna leave early,

03:43.832 --> 03:46.574
so it's gonna be another
month and a half.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.576
I'm really glad I went.

03:48.576 --> 03:51.579
My mind had started
to spin being apart,

03:51.579 --> 03:53.668
but we had a really great time.

03:53.668 --> 03:57.237
And he's excited
to come back to 51.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.673
Good.

03:58.673 --> 04:02.111
You know, the absence
of a leader like Severide

04:02.111 --> 04:05.027
is always gonna have an effect
on the dynamic here.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.463
So it is our job

04:06.463 --> 04:08.639
to keep things running smoothly
in the meantime.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.946
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.730
Come on. Let's go.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.518
- See you, Chief.
- Hey.

04:17.518 --> 04:18.997
Thought you had
the oncologist

04:18.997 --> 04:20.085
appointment this morning.

04:20.085 --> 04:22.000
Yeah.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.567
It got postponed until Friday.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.005
I'm sorry.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.573
I know how hard
the waiting has been.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.358
I'll make sure Donna knows
so she can reach out to Cindy.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.360
Yeah.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.926
If there is anything
that I can do...

04:36.537 --> 04:41.150
<i>All units, structure fire,
3397 Frederick.</i>

05:15.358 --> 05:17.055
Hey, you okay?

05:18.709 --> 05:20.581
All right, nice and easy.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.147
- Oh!
- Come on.

05:27.805 --> 05:28.763
Nice and easy.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.591
You got it?
- Yeah.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.332
Hey, what happened in there?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.203
We were doing a blood drive,

05:34.203 --> 05:35.813
and the place just
started filling with smoke.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.293
We saw flames in the hallway.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.208
It started somewhere
in the back of the building.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.601
Okay. All right.

05:40.601 --> 05:41.863
All right, Herrmann!
- Yeah.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.212
Let's get a line
on that fire.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.648
Hold it back.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.781
Truck, Squad,
let's do a primary search.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.304
Truck handles the blood drive.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.479
Squad, you clear the rest
of the building.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.959
- Copy.
- Let's go.

05:50.959 --> 05:51.916
Come on.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.314
All right, we split up.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.620
Capp, Tony, take the left side.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.491
Bamford, we're on the right.
Stay on my hip.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.710
Well, I don't really
need a babysitter,

06:02.710 --> 06:04.712
but all right, you're the boss.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.326
Capp, Tony, basement!

06:10.326 --> 06:11.893
Copy.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.547
Everyone, let's clear away
from the building.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.375
Is anyone hurt?
- Fire department!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.377
Call out!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
Fire department! Call out!

06:19.379 --> 06:21.729
Help! Over here!

06:23.470 --> 06:24.645
Hey!

06:24.645 --> 06:26.255
Don't worry about the fire!

06:26.255 --> 06:27.604
You gotta get outside.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.432
The cooler, we need
to save the cooler.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.478
No--

06:41.531 --> 06:43.272
We need to save the cooler!

06:43.272 --> 06:45.100
- Gallo, give me a hand.
- Yeah.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.930
Mouch,
check for other victims

06:48.930 --> 06:50.627
and then try to get
that cooler.

06:50.627 --> 06:54.588
- Copy.
- One, two, three.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.372
Come on. We gotta go.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.206
Fire department!
Call out!

07:08.297 --> 07:10.995
Fire department! Call out!

07:10.995 --> 07:12.649
Please! Please, help!

07:12.649 --> 07:15.783
Help me! Please help me!

07:15.783 --> 07:17.915
I'm over here. Please help me.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.743
- I can get to her.
- Do it!

07:19.743 --> 07:21.179
Please help! Please!

07:21.179 --> 07:23.007
Help, help! Here! Please!

07:23.007 --> 07:25.488
Stay down. It's all right.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.316
Just stay down.
You're gonna be all right.

07:27.316 --> 07:30.058
Can you get her out
through the window?

07:30.058 --> 07:32.016
Affirmative.
See you outside.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.757
- Copy that.
- You're gonna stay low.

07:33.757 --> 07:37.152
You're gonna stay next to me.
We're gonna be all right.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.849
Squad, there's one victim,
coming out, delta side.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.503
<i>Copy that.</i>

07:49.207 --> 07:51.558
Fire department! Call out!

07:51.558 --> 07:54.343
Let's make this arch
our position.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.823
Copy.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.231
All right,
let's get you some oxygen.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.929
- Where is he?
- Hey.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.932
He's got a job to do, but he'll
be out when he can, all right?

08:17.932 --> 08:19.150
Medic.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.979
Here. It's okay.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.372
Okay.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.507
Hey, you did it.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.943
Nice work.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.423
Let's go over here
and get you checked out.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.860
Finished our sweep, Lieutenant.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.078
No more victims
in the back room.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.341
All right. Mouch, report.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.306
Mouch, where are you?

08:48.397 --> 08:49.354
Joe!

08:53.837 --> 08:54.925
Hey, whoa.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.100
Keep back. It's hot.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.928
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.998
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.956
- They're good?
- They are.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.479
Thank you.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.960
This is enough blood to save
a hundred lives or more.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.614
Look at you, Mouch.

09:31.614 --> 09:32.746
A hundred lives?

09:32.746 --> 09:34.225
That's gotta be
some kind of record.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.753
All right,
now let's get you checked out.

09:41.711 --> 09:45.193
Okay, 51, let's wrap it up.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.171
That was a bloodbath,
am I right?

10:07.171 --> 10:08.956
Yeah, it was a new one on me.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.132
Yeah, that was a good fire.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.177
Cruz tried to sideline me
back there,

10:13.177 --> 10:15.223
and I still
pulled off the save.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.147
Chief, you got a sec?

10:26.147 --> 10:27.583
What do you need, Joe?

10:34.111 --> 10:35.678
Keith Bamford
isn't working out.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.027
How so?

10:37.027 --> 10:38.550
He doesn't seem
to respect me much,

10:38.550 --> 10:41.162
and I just figured there's
gotta be somebody else

10:41.162 --> 10:42.903
we can get
that won't give me heartburn.

10:42.903 --> 10:46.471
If he isn't respecting
your command, write him up.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.299
I can find a new replacement.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.953
Write him up?

10:49.953 --> 10:52.390
He has been detailed here
due to Severide's absence.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.218
So if you wanna get rid of him,

10:54.218 --> 10:55.959
you need to document cause.

10:55.959 --> 10:59.833
I mean, I figured
I'm just acting lieutenant.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.271
Chief, I don't wanna be
the reason the guy

11:03.271 --> 11:04.576
gets a black mark
on his record.

11:04.576 --> 11:07.797
Cruz,
you are leading Squad 3.

11:07.797 --> 11:10.234
Either make it work
or send him packing.

11:10.234 --> 11:11.453
Your call.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.196
Thank you, Chief.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.687
Hey, what you
got there, Mouch?

11:27.687 --> 11:32.256
A Chicago classic,
'72 American LaFrance.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.997
- What is that, a model?
- Sure is.

11:33.997 --> 11:37.174
1:25 scale, level 5 build.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.698
That's the highest level.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.264
That's neat.
What a fun hobby.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.613
It's not a hobby.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.876
It's historical preservation.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.748
You all know the Chicago
Craftsmanship Museum?

11:45.748 --> 11:47.054
- No.
- I really haven't heard of it.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.969
Normally when I finish
one of these bad boys,

11:48.969 --> 11:51.667
I donate it to the museum
for the world to enjoy,

11:51.667 --> 11:55.018
but this one,
I'm building on commission.

11:55.018 --> 11:58.369
Deputy District Chief Clem
Girardi recognized my talents

11:58.369 --> 12:01.633
from a '64 Mack Pumper
I built a few years back

12:01.633 --> 12:04.680
and personally asked me
to track this one down for him.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.855
Why?

12:05.855 --> 12:07.204
Yeah, why didn't
he build it himself?

12:07.204 --> 12:08.684
Isn't that the point
of these models?

12:10.077 --> 12:12.862
It's a level 5, Brett.

12:12.862 --> 12:16.779
And while I find a challenge
like this calming,

12:16.779 --> 12:20.217
a real meditation,
an amateur builder

12:20.217 --> 12:22.176
would crumble
under the pressure.

12:22.176 --> 12:25.309
It takes patience
and a laser-like focus.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.834
You have to go totally zen.

12:27.834 --> 12:32.926
If any one piece is off axis
when that glue dries...

12:36.886 --> 12:38.148
You have to reglue it?

12:38.148 --> 12:41.717
Where's the deck gun?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.806
Nobody move.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.464
Come on! Where is it?

12:49.464 --> 12:50.682
There has to be a deck gun!

12:50.682 --> 12:52.815
It's the metaphorical
cherry on top.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.818
<i>Ambulance 61,
person in distress.</i>

12:55.818 --> 12:58.734
- Watch your step.
<i>- 348 West Maxwell.</i>

13:04.044 --> 13:06.481
Hurry, please!
My husband, he's acting crazy.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.004
I don't know what's wrong.
- Yeah, what's his name?

13:08.004 --> 13:09.092
Andrew.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.267
Don't.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.834
No, stay away.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.314
Whoa.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.706
Hey, Andrew,
we're here to help.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.535
What's he doing here?

13:17.535 --> 13:19.363
Why--why'd you bring him?

13:19.363 --> 13:20.800
No, no, no!

13:25.500 --> 13:28.503
Make him go away.
All of you, leave.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.505
Has he taken any drugs,
prescription, recreational?

13:30.505 --> 13:33.377
No, he doesn't. He wouldn't.
He gets drug tested for work.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.901
He's a county prosecutor.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.424
How long
has he been like this?

13:36.424 --> 13:38.818
Not long, a few minutes
before you got here.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.341
A few hours ago,
he had a bad headache.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.516
He was dizzy.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.866
He started throwing up,
and then this.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.954
Maybe it's food poisoning?

13:44.954 --> 13:46.260
What has he eaten today?

13:46.260 --> 13:48.958
He had oatmeal
and a grapefruit, I think.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.568
Okay, he's calming down.

13:50.568 --> 13:53.876
Let's take a look.
- Okay.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.923
Hey, Andrew, we're gonna
do a quick exam, okay?

13:56.923 --> 13:59.012
What's happening to me?

13:59.012 --> 14:00.361
That's what
we're gonna figure out, okay?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.672
May I have your hand?

14:07.672 --> 14:10.414
Great.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.894
Heart rate's elevated.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.330
All right,
I'll get his pressure.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.507
What's--what's happening?

14:16.507 --> 14:18.553
Why can't he breathe?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.381
I hear wheezing.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.209
All right, drop 0.3 epi.
I'll get the CPAP on him.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.775
You got it.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.734
Andrew, you need
to try and stay calm.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.779
Take slow, easy breaths, okay?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.045
All right.

14:45.406 --> 14:48.191
Okay, he's stable,
but we need to get him to Med.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.540
Something's not right here.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.934
These symptoms do not add up.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.414
I'm gonna grab the stretcher.
- Yeah.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.982
Oh. Oh.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.167
Hey, Kidd, can I, uh,
pick your brain for a second?

15:07.167 --> 15:09.386
Sure, just leave me
enough to work with.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.957
Hey, you know
how you ironed out

15:14.957 --> 15:16.785
that situation with Carver?

15:16.785 --> 15:17.960
Is it ironed out?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.788
I'm never quite sure.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.050
What's up?

15:21.050 --> 15:22.356
Is Bamford still
giving you grief?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.010
It's tricky.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.882
Solid firefighter.
It's just that attitude of his.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.579
Ah.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.364
Boden said it's up to me
whether to keep him or not.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.453
I just wanna give it
my best effort.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.936
I thought Carver
was a lost cause at first,

15:36.936 --> 15:39.242
you know,
just a cocky pain in the ass.

15:39.242 --> 15:42.985
But I dug a little deeper,
and turned out

15:42.985 --> 15:45.379
there was a lot more going on.

15:45.379 --> 15:48.208
I can't say
it fully corrected, though.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.775
What, so maybe that's what
I should do with Bamford.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.082
You know, dig a little deeper,
see what I've got?

15:53.082 --> 15:55.606
Sounds right to me.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.174
- Thanks, Kidd.
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.871
Gotcha.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.919
Hey, man, is there
more coffee sweetener

16:03.919 --> 16:05.138
hiding around here someplace?

16:05.138 --> 16:06.530
You know, I'm still
finding my way

16:06.530 --> 16:08.880
around this kitchen myself.
Maybe try that one?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.188
Ah, score!

16:14.234 --> 16:15.931
- Hey, Bamford?
- Yeah?

16:15.931 --> 16:17.672
You got any plans
tomorrow night?

16:17.672 --> 16:19.282
I don't think so. Why?

16:19.282 --> 16:22.068
Meet me at Molly's,
join me for a beer.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.767
Yeah, sure.

16:25.767 --> 16:26.811
I just had a beer
with this guy.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.291
I gotta do it again?

16:28.291 --> 16:33.166
Is this like a thing with 51,
mandatory team spirit?

16:33.166 --> 16:36.517
I'll tell you something,
this place is high maintenance.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.822
Maybe a little.

16:37.822 --> 16:41.174
Hey, Mouch,
how about this one?

16:41.174 --> 16:42.262
It's got a deck gun
that might fit,

16:42.262 --> 16:44.046
and there are three in stock

16:44.046 --> 16:45.743
right now at the Target
on LaSalle.

16:45.743 --> 16:46.788
Keep looking.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.224
We've searched everywhere.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.357
We've searched hobby sites
and eBay stores--

16:50.357 --> 16:54.317
Gallo has been
on the deep web for hours.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.189
I'm almost bought a real gun
from a guy in Slovenia.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.625
I'm probably on some
government watchlist now.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.802
It looks pretty close
to what's on the box.

17:00.802 --> 17:05.024
Would you put a Volkswagen
engine in a Ferrari?

17:07.896 --> 17:09.811
Chief Girardi.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.943
At ease, gentlemen.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.597
I was in the area
when I got your text

17:13.597 --> 17:15.034
about the model coming in.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.818
Figured I'd stop by
and see for myself.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.299
It's still
a work in progress.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.301
Ooh, looks like
it's really coming together.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.824
You could finish
by end of shift, huh?

17:22.824 --> 17:24.913
Uh, I don't know about that.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.567
A call or two might come in.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.569
Yeah, we're one of the
busiest houses in the city.

17:28.569 --> 17:29.874
Uh-huh.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
Well, whatever you can do
to complete it ASAP,

17:31.354 --> 17:34.401
I would greatly appreciate.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.752
You know, my father rode
on a rig just like this.

17:39.754 --> 17:44.585
He doesn't have much time left.
Any day now really.

17:44.585 --> 17:48.197
- Oh, wow, I didn't realize.
- You know what?

17:48.197 --> 17:49.894
I didn't wanna put any
unnecessary pressure on you

17:49.894 --> 17:54.595
to find it in time, but now
here it is taking shape.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.118
I knew we could
count on you, McHolland.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.905
Gentlemen.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.131
We're--

18:09.131 --> 18:10.872
Mm-hmm, yeah.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.309
Ah.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.137
I once saw a case
of pufferfish poisoning

18:15.137 --> 18:16.617
that had similar symptoms.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.053
Tetrodotoxin, right?

18:18.053 --> 18:20.011
Yeah, headache,
vomiting, stomach pain,

18:20.011 --> 18:21.143
mental impairment,
cardiac arrhythmia.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.927
It was all there.

18:22.927 --> 18:26.017
But I doubt he was garnishing
his oatmeal with pufferfish.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.193
Well, maybe it's a mental

18:27.193 --> 18:29.020
and physical breakdown
due to stress.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.283
His wife said
he's a county prosecutor,

18:30.283 --> 18:31.675
which is
a pretty stressful job.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.024
Maybe.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.983
I'd be curious to see
what the tox report says.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.767
I couldn't help overhearing.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.248
At my last house, we had a call
where this guy was going nuts,

18:39.248 --> 18:40.467
acting like a real whack job.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.946
Turns out his liver
was failing.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.558
Yeah, that's called
end-stage liver disease, ESLD,

18:44.558 --> 18:46.168
which is associated
with delirium due to

18:46.168 --> 18:47.952
altered cortical
brain activity.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.607
And abdominal pain
and nausea, which our guy had.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.043
But his wife said
he's been in great health,

18:52.043 --> 18:53.088
and there's been
no previous signs,

18:53.088 --> 18:54.176
so that can't be it.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.483
Not a bad guess, though.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.006
I'm thinking guesses
aren't good enough

18:58.006 --> 18:59.355
in your line of work.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.835
Well, sometimes
it's the best we can do

19:00.835 --> 19:02.576
until we get them to Med.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.667
So what's your story,
Bamford?

19:06.667 --> 19:08.190
My story?

19:08.190 --> 19:09.844
Yeah, your background.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.368
Like, you got any family
at home?

19:12.368 --> 19:14.240
Two kids and an ex.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.155
AKA, I'm broke.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.593
Sorry to hear that.

19:19.593 --> 19:20.681
Yeah.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.596
How old are your kids?

19:22.596 --> 19:28.863
10 and 12,
two girls, great kids.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.213
I miss them like hell
when they're with the ex.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.354
I'm a terrible person.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.964
What are you talking about?

19:42.964 --> 19:45.140
I came to work
to avoid Cindy.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.750
She's so stressed out
right now,

19:46.750 --> 19:48.230
I wasn't sure that
I could handle it.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.277
So--but what kind
of person does that?

19:51.277 --> 19:54.715
A loving husband who maybe
needs a little break.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.586
Eh.

20:02.288 --> 20:06.117
I gotta go home, right,
calm her down,

20:06.117 --> 20:07.945
be there for her and the kids.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.251
Whatever you want.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.427
I got the bar, all right?

20:11.427 --> 20:12.646
Go.
- All right.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.648
Go.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.686
Morning, super medic.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.514
Hey, Reggie.
How's the elbow?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.298
Better, thanks.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.648
I'm carrying gallons of gin
and juice now with no problem.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.085
Mm. It's important work.

21:01.085 --> 21:05.046
I owe you an apology,
or at least I'm going to.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.875
I'm having some renovations
done on the living room.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.703
You know,
building it out a little bit.

21:09.703 --> 21:10.878
It could get loud.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.662
Oh, don't worry about that.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.011
I'm barely home
during the day anyway.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.274
Well, I'll remind you of that

21:15.274 --> 21:16.710
when you come banging
on my door.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.887
I'll see you then.

21:19.887 --> 21:23.107
Hey, Reggie,
have you hired anybody yet?

21:23.107 --> 21:25.893
Because I think I might have
a great recommendation for you.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.635
Well, you just lost
a potential customer

21:28.635 --> 21:32.029
and gained a one-star review
on Yelp.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.944
Still no luck
finding the deck gun?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.337
It's worse than that.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.078
After calling every hobby shop
in the Midwest,

21:37.078 --> 21:39.907
I found a place in Des Moines
that has a complete kit

21:39.907 --> 21:41.648
for a '72 American LaFrance.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.389
That sounds like good news.

21:43.389 --> 21:46.914
Except the old man who runs
the place says it's in storage

21:46.914 --> 21:48.481
and he can't get to it
right now on account

21:48.481 --> 21:50.396
of his recent hip surgery.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.050
Says it'll take
three or four weeks at least.

21:53.050 --> 21:55.879
So you're going
after him on Yelp?

21:57.794 --> 21:59.927
I'm in a desperate
situation here.

21:59.927 --> 22:03.931
Well, I picked one up
just in case.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.325
Yeah, it was on sale
for like eight bucks.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.718
Anything that's
for ages three and up

22:08.718 --> 22:11.373
isn't exactly
museum-grade quality.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.027
You just need the deck gun.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.638
And it really seemed like
his father could go any minute.

22:15.638 --> 22:19.033
True, and I would rather
not have his last words be,

22:19.033 --> 22:21.078
"That's the wrong deck gun."

22:23.385 --> 22:24.734
I'm not giving up yet.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.215
So he has a family,
you know, kids.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.043
I just can't give up
on the guy.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.305
I mean, I know how much stress

22:30.305 --> 22:31.654
that can bring
to someone's life.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.656
I haven't been
to a school game in weeks.

22:33.656 --> 22:34.962
I even missed out on Otis

22:34.962 --> 22:36.442
saying Javi's name
for the first time.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.660
Oh.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.359
Yeah, he called him Vi-vi.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.664
I don't know how you juggle

22:41.664 --> 22:43.013
everything as a lieutenant.

22:43.013 --> 22:46.974
I don't have to deal
with the kids part yet.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.237
You got this, Joe Cruz.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.373
I mean, now I'm on
the same roller coaster

22:54.373 --> 22:57.419
I was a few days ago.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.334
And all I can think is...

22:59.334 --> 23:01.902
If--if it's bad news...

23:08.299 --> 23:10.606
I won't make it.

23:10.606 --> 23:13.827
You've gotta do your best
to push those thoughts

23:13.827 --> 23:15.785
right out of your head.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.483
Is the appointment tomorrow?

23:17.483 --> 23:21.661
Uh, yeah. At 9:00 a.m.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.185
Right.

23:24.185 --> 23:29.233
Hey, you know who's been
calling to check in regular?

23:29.233 --> 23:31.105
Matt Casey.

23:31.105 --> 23:34.891
Well, that's good to hear,
and I am not surprised.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.851
I heard Cindy talking
to him again yesterday.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.853
He can really cheer her up.

23:39.853 --> 23:43.857
I think she's always had
a little crush on him,

23:43.857 --> 23:45.989
to be honest.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.519
The last two days, she, um,

23:53.519 --> 23:58.349
she's been holding it
together pretty good.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.918
And now it's me
that's losing it.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.711
It's just that if...

24:11.711 --> 24:15.671
the chemo didn't work,

24:15.671 --> 24:19.675
there is not a lot
of other options.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.036
You know...

24:35.474 --> 24:41.088
Maybe it'll all be fine,

24:41.088 --> 24:42.916
or at least a little fine.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.919
It can just be
a little fine, right?

24:45.919 --> 24:49.357
I mean, that's--
it's not too much to ask.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.185
No, it isn't.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.493
Yeah.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.018
All right,
I'll grab the syringes

24:58.018 --> 24:59.454
and the saline flushes.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.282
See if you can find
a spare CPAP circuit,

25:01.282 --> 25:03.545
but we may have to order one.
- Heads up! Coming through!

25:03.545 --> 25:05.112
Okay, I'll call you back.
What are we looking at?

25:05.112 --> 25:06.287
We're not really sure--
a headache,

25:06.287 --> 25:07.723
nausea, confusion,
stomach pain,

25:07.723 --> 25:09.203
cardiac and respiratory distress.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.944
Trauma three right away.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.119
Hey, Will, we had a patient
with the same

25:12.119 --> 25:14.121
cascading symptoms
the other day.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.557
This is our second one
this morning.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.950
The other went to Lakeview,
and they told us they had

25:16.950 --> 25:18.865
a couple of more just like it.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.084
Sounds like a multiple
exposure scenario.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.565
We'll start revving up
the tox screens.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.611
Damn.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.221
This is not good.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.179
What the hell is going on?

25:42.541 --> 25:43.803
Getting close, huh?

25:43.803 --> 25:44.891
Just about.

25:44.891 --> 25:49.286
One last decal
to stick into place.

26:09.350 --> 26:12.048
And there it is.

26:12.048 --> 26:15.095
The '72 American LaFrance.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.313
Wow.

26:16.313 --> 26:19.012
18 hours
of total building time,

26:19.012 --> 26:20.796
horrible eye strain,

26:20.796 --> 26:22.929
super glue
under all my fingernails,

26:22.929 --> 26:27.586
and a crick in my neck
that'll last for weeks.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.414
But it's all worth it
to hold a piece of history

26:30.414 --> 26:33.374
in your hands.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.638
Unfortunately,
it isn't complete

26:36.638 --> 26:38.988
and will sully my reputation

26:38.988 --> 26:41.991
in the fire replica community
once word gets out.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.472
I doubt anyone will notice.
It looks amazing.

26:44.472 --> 26:47.170
His father rode this rig.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.781
Of course he'll notice.

26:48.781 --> 26:52.175
And what happens
when he passes shortly?

26:52.175 --> 26:55.004
What if Chief Girardi decides
to donate it to the museum

26:55.004 --> 27:00.227
and then my folly is on
full display for all to see?

27:00.227 --> 27:02.359
I'm sorry.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.535
It's time to face the music.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.888
Call Chief Girardi.

27:08.888 --> 27:12.848
A dying man's wish is more
important than my bruised ego.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.284
I found one!

27:14.284 --> 27:17.548
An authentic miniature
American LaFrance deck gun.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.289
Oh, thank God. Where?

27:19.289 --> 27:22.205
I posted about the missing
piece on a Reddit forum,

27:22.205 --> 27:25.556
and this guy from Berwyn wrote
me back and says he has one.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.428
Really?
How much does he want for it?

27:27.428 --> 27:29.038
Nothing. He wants to trade.

27:29.038 --> 27:31.127
I mentioned we're firefighters,
he got really excited.

27:31.127 --> 27:34.304
Wants to swap for something
off of our rigs.

27:34.304 --> 27:35.871
Like what?
It's all city owned.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.831
You can't just give it away.
- Unless...

27:38.831 --> 27:41.311
there is something
we carry on our rigs

27:41.311 --> 27:43.705
the CFD didn't pay for.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.187
I'm glad they're
gonna be running

27:47.187 --> 27:48.362
more tox screens at Med.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.711
Hopefully that'll tell us more.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.234
Yeah, with everything
going on out there,

27:51.234 --> 27:54.368
you just gotta hope
it's not communicable.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.283
Be right back.

27:56.283 --> 27:59.590
Hey, my neighbor Reggie
is doing some construction

27:59.590 --> 28:03.551
on his apartment,
and I told him about you.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.683
Here's his number.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.598
That's--that's very cool.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.687
Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.559
<i>Ambulance 61.</i>

28:11.559 --> 28:13.256
<i>Person injured.</i>
- Ugh, it's nonstop.

28:13.256 --> 28:16.303
<i>6701 Indiana.</i>

28:16.303 --> 28:18.914
She's this way. Follow me.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.264
I think she's having
a panic attack or something.

28:21.264 --> 28:23.092
I don't know, it's weird.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.445
- Marilyn?
- You know her?

28:28.445 --> 28:29.708
We treated her husband
the other day.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.318
My stomach, it burns.

28:31.318 --> 28:35.191
- We should mask up.
- Yeah.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.627
Here, have a seat, Marilyn.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.851
Her pupils are dilated.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.114
Heart rate's elevated.
I'm gonna check her pressure.

28:45.114 --> 28:47.856
Marilyn, can you tell us what
happened before you got sick?

28:47.856 --> 28:49.466
I went home
to check on Andrew.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.511
How's he doing?

28:50.511 --> 28:52.295
Better.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.688
But I had a bad headache.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.995
I haven't been sleeping well,
worried about him.

28:55.995 --> 29:01.043
So I took something for it,
came back to work, and--

29:01.043 --> 29:04.351
Ow!

29:04.351 --> 29:06.135
What is this?

29:06.135 --> 29:07.963
It hurts so bad.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.617
- Let's get her to Med.
- Okay.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.144
Hey, thanks for lunch, Cruz.
You didn't have to do this.

29:15.144 --> 29:17.799
Well, I thought it would be
a good morale booster.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.279
You thought right, Joe.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.672
How'd you find
the tamale guy, by the way?

29:21.672 --> 29:24.066
I tried tracking him down
on Twitter, but no dice.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.720
I have my sources.

29:25.720 --> 29:29.115
Like I said, hon,
I'm ready to go.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.377
I know, Cindy.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.814
Yeah, I know, 9:00 a.m.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.077
Don't worry, all right?
I'll be there.

29:37.036 --> 29:42.041
Boy, she really got
you whipped, doesn't she?

29:42.041 --> 29:43.216
Huh?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.131
I'm saying,
she keeps a tight leash.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.654
I saw how she had
you running out

29:46.654 --> 29:47.873
of Molly's the other night.
- Hey.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.744
It's not your fault.

29:49.744 --> 29:52.138
The relationship between
a husband and a wife

29:52.138 --> 29:53.443
is psychological--

29:53.443 --> 29:56.403
one's psycho,
the other's logical.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.145
Looks to me like you got
yourself a real psycho there.

30:03.366 --> 30:04.846
- Whoa, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.761
Herrmann, Herrmann.
Herrmann, Herrmann, Herrmann.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.285
Hey, ignore him.

30:11.157 --> 30:14.769
You will never know anybody
as good as Cindy Herrmann.

30:24.431 --> 30:27.782
Herrmann, I'm so sorry.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.262
He's an idiot.

30:29.262 --> 30:31.786
He better steer clear
or I'll lay him out.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.229
Okay, I'm trying
not to freak out,

30:40.229 --> 30:42.536
but did whatever this is
just go viral?

30:42.536 --> 30:44.407
It'd be way more widespread.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.323
I'm just saying, the same
exact symptoms as her husband?

30:47.323 --> 30:48.585
It can't be a coincidence.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.675
No, I agree,
but why now, days later?

30:51.675 --> 30:52.938
What if it's something new,

30:52.938 --> 30:54.591
something we don't have
in our playbook?

30:54.591 --> 30:57.072
The next Ebola or COVID?
- I don't know.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.769
I just keep thinking
of what Marilyn said.

30:58.769 --> 31:01.860
They both had headaches,
which we've been assuming

31:01.860 --> 31:05.385
is the first symptom,
but what if it's the cause?

31:05.385 --> 31:08.127
What do you mean?

31:08.127 --> 31:10.390
If I remember right, they
don't live too far from here.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.782
Okay.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.090
Hey, Andrew, wait.

31:15.090 --> 31:17.527
We were here the other day.
We took you to the hospital.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.051
I got a call about my wife.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.313
She's at Med
in stable condition.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.967
- I have to see her.
- No, I know,

31:21.967 --> 31:23.620
but before you go,
you and your wife both

31:23.620 --> 31:25.884
took medication for headaches
and then got very sick.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.363
Did you take
the same medication?

31:27.363 --> 31:28.799
Yeah, I guess.

31:28.799 --> 31:29.888
We keep a bottle
in the kitchen.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.106
Could you get it for me?

31:31.106 --> 31:32.499
- Now?
- Yeah, it's important.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.935
It could help us figure out
why this happened.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.503
Okay, be right back.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.897
You think it's a reaction
to the medication?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.811
I hope that's all it is.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.117
He is looking better.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.597
That was
a pretty quick recovery.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.033
Here it is.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.948
Was there plastic on the cap
when you bought it?

31:46.948 --> 31:48.341
Plastic?
I don't remember.

31:48.341 --> 31:51.126
How about the seal?
Was it intact?

31:51.126 --> 31:52.823
I think my wife opened it.
Why?

31:52.823 --> 31:54.173
What's all this about?

31:54.173 --> 31:55.130
I'm worried someone
might have

31:55.130 --> 31:57.132
tampered with the medication.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.836
That looks like--

32:05.836 --> 32:07.490
that was from a syringe.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.590
Yeah, I'll make sure
to tell them.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.810
You let us know
if there's anything more

32:22.810 --> 32:24.986
we can do on our end.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.596
Voight says nice work.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.250
They followed up
with the other victims,

32:28.250 --> 32:29.773
all those who were taking
the same medication

32:29.773 --> 32:31.906
from the same store,
and they have already

32:31.906 --> 32:33.386
pulled it from the shelves.

32:33.386 --> 32:35.257
They're contacting anyone
who made a recent purchase.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.129
So that means someone
did this in the store?

32:37.129 --> 32:39.479
Or bought a bunch of pills
and put them back on the shelf.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.394
Either way, they're combing
through the store's

32:41.394 --> 32:43.178
security footage
from the past week or so,

32:43.178 --> 32:45.659
looking for a possible suspect.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.443
How twisted
do you have to be?

32:47.443 --> 32:49.619
Yeah,
it all sounds too familiar.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.360
The Tylenol murders of '82.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.362
That's what gave me the idea.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.277
You think
there's a copycat out there?

32:55.277 --> 32:56.757
Wouldn't be the first time.

32:56.757 --> 32:57.845
Won't be the last.

32:57.845 --> 33:02.589
But you two,
you saved lives today.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.721
It was all Brett's idea.
She put two and two together.

33:04.721 --> 33:07.463
But in '82,
it was cyanide poisoning,

33:07.463 --> 33:08.943
which killed a bunch of people.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.467
We had, what, eight or nine
victims that we know of?

33:11.467 --> 33:13.730
All of them got sick, but
thankfully, none of them died.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.515
Maybe it was
less concentrated,

33:15.515 --> 33:17.473
used a needle
to spray whatever it was

33:17.473 --> 33:18.953
all over the pills like that.

33:18.953 --> 33:22.652
PD is looking into it,
having their labs analyze it.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.655
I'm sure they'll come up
with some answers soon enough.

33:25.655 --> 33:26.482
Thank you.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.489
JD, this is Mouch.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.491
Mouch, this is JD.
- Hey.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.015
Thanks for driving
all the way in from Berwyn.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.146
I took the Blue Line.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.496
Oh, okay.
You brought the deck gun?

33:40.496 --> 33:41.758
I don't mean to rush things,

33:41.758 --> 33:43.934
but I am working
on borrowed time here.

33:43.934 --> 33:47.808
This is authentic, injection
molded in polystyrene.

33:47.808 --> 33:51.029
You won't find me hawking
any 3D-printed replicas.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.856
Uh, you got what you promised?

33:52.856 --> 33:55.163
Of course, even trade.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.865
This is the Slamigan.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.042
Part sledge hammer,
part Halligan bar.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.217
It will open any door.

34:05.217 --> 34:08.176
Signed by the inventor himself,
Joe Cruz.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.569
Okay.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.790
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.401
That looks exactly
like the one

34:15.401 --> 34:16.837
from the model kit
I bought for you.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.970
But it's not.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.885
So you're headed
to see the cops now?

34:21.885 --> 34:23.931
Yeah, hopefully they'll
have some more information.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.193
Keep me posted.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.455
Hey, your neighbor
called me back.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.153
I'm set to start next week.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.068
I might have told him that
you did all the renovations

34:30.068 --> 34:32.809
in my apartment
and are extremely talented,

34:32.809 --> 34:35.508
so do not screw this up.

34:35.508 --> 34:36.900
I'll do my best.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.042
Hey, Bamford.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.609
What's up?

34:49.609 --> 34:51.089
Oh, look, if this is about
Molly's, I got a date tonight.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.873
It's not about Molly's.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.918
Look, I just wanted
to say thank you

34:54.918 --> 34:57.269
for taking up the slack
around here

34:57.269 --> 35:00.837
for the last couple of shifts,
but you're not a good fit.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.319
Oh, come on.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.147
Cruz, I'm still getting
to know the guys.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.670
I didn't know
his wife was sick.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.976
You don't know
anything about her,

35:08.976 --> 35:10.978
but that didn't keep you
from running your mouth.

35:10.978 --> 35:13.328
I was going for a laugh.

35:13.328 --> 35:17.245
Okay, look, I will be
more careful, all right?

35:19.508 --> 35:21.815
Hey, I got two girls, you know?

35:24.078 --> 35:25.775
You'll find
another house, Bamford.

35:25.775 --> 35:26.820
Seriously?

35:29.344 --> 35:32.130
Wow.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.914
Okay.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.839
Didn't work out, huh?

35:48.494 --> 35:50.931
I knew in my gut
the whole time.

35:50.931 --> 35:54.108
I should have listened
to it earlier.

35:54.108 --> 35:56.328
I don't think I'm cut out
for this lieutenant thing.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.766
I was gonna say the opposite.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.160
Watching you
figure this one out,

36:02.160 --> 36:04.466
do your due diligence.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.902
I've got bad news.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.513
You've got leadership
all over you.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.920
You did it!

36:23.920 --> 36:26.271
Wow, what a beaut.

36:26.271 --> 36:27.794
Look at this.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.797
Has the red wheels, gold trim.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.277
Even has a little deck gun.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.104
It wouldn't be
complete without it.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.497
I can't thank you enough.

36:35.497 --> 36:38.196
This will make my father
so happy.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.458
Oh.

36:42.765 --> 36:45.420
Vera, honey, come out here.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.467
- Is that for me?
- Uh-huh.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.685
Now, don't run away with it.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.078
Let me get a photo
for Grandpa first.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.298
I, uh, I thought
this was for your pop.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.169
Oh, it is, yeah, a photo
of his granddaughter playing

36:55.169 --> 36:57.258
with a toy truck just like
the one he used to ride on

36:57.258 --> 36:58.520
will mean the world to him.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.218
- Toy?
- Bang!

37:00.218 --> 37:01.523
Whoo!

37:01.523 --> 37:03.003
Thanks again, McHolland.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.222
I better get a photo quick
before the kid

37:04.222 --> 37:06.528
destroys it, huh?

37:06.528 --> 37:09.096
Whee! Oh!
Oh, would you look at her?

37:09.096 --> 37:11.011
She's a wild one.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.491
Hey, hold still
so it's not blurry.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.668
- Bang!
- Oh, boy, really aggressive.

37:15.668 --> 37:17.147
You're having fun, though.
I'm gonna take a video.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.630
There he is,
putting about a dozen

37:21.630 --> 37:23.241
or so bottles
back on the shelf.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.459
Wow, you were right, Vi.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.069
He took them home first.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.158
Mm-hmm, and paid for each one
with his own credit card.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.770
Ugh, I can't tell if he's
extremely cocky or stupid.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.989
I brought him in--
little bit of both.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.295
Did the lab results
come back yet?

37:34.295 --> 37:36.428
Traces of LSD and cyanide.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.560
Yeah, talk about a bad trip.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.214
He probably took inspiration
from '82

37:40.214 --> 37:41.433
but put his own spin on it.

37:41.433 --> 37:42.825
- Mm.
- Yeah.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.784
Injecting poison through
a tamper-proof seal,

37:44.784 --> 37:46.786
which was invented because
of the Tylenol murders.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.222
I guess that explains
why some people

37:48.222 --> 37:49.702
got more sick than others.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.312
There's no way for it
to be distributed evenly.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.748
And mostly just the pills
on top were affected.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.272
We're thinking he wanted
to scare people

37:54.272 --> 37:55.925
more than anything, probably
wanted to get arrested,

37:55.925 --> 37:57.579
make the news.
- Yeah, well, it worked.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.320
I'm scared as hell,
and I'm gonna be

37:59.320 --> 38:01.801
triple checking the seals
on my medication from now on.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.585
Yeah. Thank you, Upton.

38:03.585 --> 38:04.499
Yeah, you got it.
See you guys.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.893
See ya.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.242
What happened now?

38:08.242 --> 38:09.417
Damn doctor moved

38:09.417 --> 38:11.245
the 9:00 a.m. appointment
to 4:00 p.m.

38:11.245 --> 38:14.683
That's seven hours away,
and I've waited long enough.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.685
The doctor will see me now.
- Come on.

38:16.685 --> 38:17.860
We'll got get some brunch,
all right?

38:17.860 --> 38:19.384
Maybe we'll go for a walk.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.907
Okay.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.569
I know you don't care,

38:30.569 --> 38:32.614
that I'm just
some faceless file to you,

38:32.614 --> 38:34.268
but I have a husband
and five kids,

38:34.268 --> 38:36.792
and I can't wait any longer
to know if I'm going

38:36.792 --> 38:38.228
to be leaving them behind.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.709
Now, before you changed it,
my appointment

38:40.709 --> 38:43.451
was for 9:00 a.m.,
which is now.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.671
And that's when
you should see me.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.021
- Cindy Herrmann?
- That's right.

38:53.766 --> 38:55.463
I think he's going
to get security.

38:55.463 --> 38:56.725
Good.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.379
Let them try
and drag me out of here.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.859
Yeah.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.643
I'm sorry for moving
the appointment.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.080
I didn't realize they had
already rescheduled it.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.821
Well, they had.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.824
Have a seat.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.743
Honestly...

39:14.743 --> 39:17.746
I have to give a lot
of bad news in this job,

39:17.746 --> 39:19.313
so I tend to save it
for the end of the day

39:19.313 --> 39:22.011
when I get the chance
to share something wonderful.

39:24.405 --> 39:27.887
It gives me some hope
to carry home with me.

39:29.279 --> 39:33.240
Something--
something wonderful?

39:33.240 --> 39:35.503
Cindy...

39:35.503 --> 39:38.376
your scan is clean.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.335
There's no cancer.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.602
The chemotherapy did its job.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.390
Now, that doesn't mean there
won't be periodic checks

39:52.390 --> 39:53.608
for the next few years.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.567
We'll have to be
vigilant about that.

39:55.567 --> 39:58.526
But this is the best news
we could hope for.

40:10.451 --> 40:13.062
I'll give you two a moment.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.629
Oh, my girl.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.332
My girl.
