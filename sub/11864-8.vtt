00:07.549 --> 00:09.625
It's Daisy. Daisy Adair.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.218
Daisy's a reaper.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.503
- What are you doing?
- Getting a ride.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.132
If you need a place...

00:15.265 --> 00:18.550
Not in that life, not in this one, not ever.
But thanks.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.306
Rube said I should bunk with you.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.731
You didn't get me a place.
Why did you say she could stay with me?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.528
- I thought you'd hit it off.
- I'd hit her.

00:28.653 --> 00:32.817
- Reggie's principal called.
- She's been cutting school.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.574
Where's she going?

00:36.578 --> 00:40.243
Keeping a dead animal
is something a crazy person would do.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.998
I'm not crazy.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.283
How do you honour Georgia's memory?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.455
Reggie's been stealing toilet seats,

00:47.589 --> 00:50.080
you think a few photos are gonna stop that?

00:50.216 --> 00:53.170
- Who complained?
- The eggs were not good.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.304
So who do we blame - the hen or the cook?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.513
Let's blame the hen.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.895
Nice guy.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

02:06.918 --> 02:09.408
Stop and smell the roses.

02:09.545 --> 02:13.045
When someone is flying through life
that's what you tell them.

02:13.174 --> 02:19.047
"Slow down, take stock, appreciate
what you have, use all your senses."

02:20.557 --> 02:23.048
"Stop and smell the roses."

02:23.184 --> 02:27.016
It's advice you tell someone
when they're 30, I guess.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.729
Not something
you'd ever tell an 18-year-old girl.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.939
I wish someone had told me...
before I died and all.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.531
I wouldn't have listened anyway.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.249
- Morning.
- Georgia...

02:56.384 --> 03:01.260
I don't mean to pick on you so early,
but may I ask you something personal?

03:01.389 --> 03:06.217
- Can I just get some coffee first?
- Have you been using my eye cream?

03:06.353 --> 03:09.768
No, Daisy. I have not touched
your stupid eye cream.

03:09.898 --> 03:14.394
Because I have noticed an erosion
over the past few days.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.612
You stole it from some dead woman's purse.

03:17.739 --> 03:22.282
It's very expensive stuff, Georgia.
It contains an anti-oxidant complex.

03:22.410 --> 03:27.119
Why don't you ever say anything to her?
Stealing from dead people?

03:27.248 --> 03:31.875
I have no moral objection to taking
the possessions of someone who's dead.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.088
- I'm gonna start stealing stuff.
- That's a bad idea.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.627
- But you said...
- I said I'm OK with this kind of theft.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.756
- What are you having, darling?
- Just coffee, please.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.177
- What fresh hell is this?
- Corned beef hash and eggs.

03:48.311 --> 03:53.103
Corned beef hash - I speak for aficionados
of the dish - is to be fried

03:53.233 --> 03:54.976
with a crisp exterior.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.861
This, my dear Casey, is not crisp. It's...

03:58.905 --> 04:01.906
- I don't know what this is.
- It doesn't look good.

04:02.033 --> 04:06.991
I do not say this phrase lightly
in this hallowed place.

04:07.122 --> 04:11.166
This is fucking inedible.
It could give me trichinosis.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.534
Don't do this to me.

04:19.134 --> 04:24.638
Please tell him how I want my hash.
It's my prerogative and this is my wish.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.722
- Let's not tarry. I'm a hungry man.
- Just dump some ketchup on it.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.855
Do what the little girl says,
put ketchup on it.

04:33.982 --> 04:38.644
The man is already in a foul mood.
He's gonna take it out on me.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.613
He might take a crap into your hash.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.029
You tip good, but you're pushing me.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.611
Telling me not to tarry.
You can kiss my ass.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.662
All right. There's work to be done.

04:53.793 --> 04:57.957
Wait. This person dies in 45 minutes.
I don't have time for coffee.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.957
I'm coming with. I don't think
it's a good idea to eat here today.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.058
I think she's one of them.

05:26.117 --> 05:31.325
- Oh, God, she's old. It's so sad.
- Would you rather she were your age?

05:31.456 --> 05:35.406
I just... I don't know. They look so sweet.

05:35.543 --> 05:39.458
Then do something sweet for her
before she dies.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.671
Excuse me.
Is one of you ladies Mrs Todd?

05:49.808 --> 05:53.141
- I'm Mrs Todd.
- Quinn, maybe you won something.

05:53.269 --> 05:57.101
Mrs Todd, that gentleman
over there on the right

05:57.232 --> 06:01.526
wanted me to tell you that you look very -
and this is a quote -

06:01.653 --> 06:04.025
beautiful today.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.607
Oh. Quinn's got an admirer.

06:07.742 --> 06:12.238
Nicely handled, Georgia.
You're growing up to be a fine grim reaper.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.370
His name is Henry Lancridge.
He made a lot of money in real estate.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.961
- Oh?
- I'd fuck him.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.090
- How was your hash?
- Excellent.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.090
- Prepared to your liking?
- Without question.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.887
- Second time around.
- I don't make a lot of money here, pal.

06:33.018 --> 06:37.015
I'm aware of that. You all right today?
You don't seem yourself.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.266
You mean my food
doesn't seem quite like me today.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.729
You are not at your best.
Your food was not good today.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.904
What's your name, my friend?

06:52.245 --> 06:55.495
- Angus Cook.
- You're a cook, your name is Cook.

06:55.623 --> 06:59.206
- Is there a fucking echo here?
- Are your people from Scotland?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.458
- Yeah.
- Edinburgh?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.079
- Yeah. Both parents.
- Lovely city.

07:05.342 --> 07:09.885
You look like a man
with a terrible problem on your mind.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.255
I wish you could unburden yourself.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.519
I'm sensing some kind
of a financial difficulty.

07:19.814 --> 07:24.144
Yeah. I lost everything I own. Everything.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.483
- Goddamn pyramid scheme.
- Vitamins?

07:26.613 --> 07:30.148
- Hair products.
- Sorry you had to go through that.

07:30.283 --> 07:34.945
Put me down for a case. Try to clear
your head when you cook tomorrow.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.291
Bye bye.

07:44.381 --> 07:49.043
- How old d'you think she is? I'm thinking 770.
- I'm not good at that.

07:49.177 --> 07:53.009
It's just a game.
You guess someone's age.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.465
How old are you? Like, 35?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.676
Yeah. You're not good at it.

07:57.811 --> 08:03.397
I can't tell if she's had work done
or whether she's just moisturised often.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.398
That's a toughie.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.148
- What moisturiser do you use?
- I don't.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.770
Georgia... Sweetheart...

08:11.825 --> 08:15.443
Just because you're dead
doesn't mean you have to give up.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.868
Your T-zone is so dry.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.368
- My what?
- Your T-zone, silly.

08:25.630 --> 08:29.213
- I have to go do this.
- OK.

08:29.342 --> 08:33.256
Be sweet about it.
You may be the last face she sees.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.926
- What a beautiful dog!
- Thank you.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.726
- Say "thank you", JD.
- Yeah, what a sweetie.

08:43.857 --> 08:48.104
He likes you. He always likes little girls.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.988
- What kind of dog is he?
- Golden retriever.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.783
They're extraordinary companions.

08:53.908 --> 08:58.866
I know I may sound crazy,
but I don't know what I'd do without JD.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.867
I really love him.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.621
And I'm sure he really loves you too.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.094
JD?

09:19.184 --> 09:22.968
JD, come! JD, come!

09:24.064 --> 09:25.262
JD!

09:43.667 --> 09:48.957
This one shouldn't have been hard.
She was old. She wasn't like me.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.758
She'd lived a life.

09:51.883 --> 09:56.047
But somehow I felt guilty.
I wasn't sure why.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.507
Maybe it was the stupid dog.
It was definitely the dog.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.762
What about JD?
Who's gonna take care of JD?

10:03.895 --> 10:06.386
Um... I don't know.

10:08.525 --> 10:12.902
- I'm not good at the pet thing.
- He likes little girls.

10:14.614 --> 10:19.323
Well, don't you have any kids
or grandchildren or something?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.406
They're thousands of miles away.

10:24.332 --> 10:28.496
- Does he bark?
- He's a dog!

10:28.628 --> 10:31.202
I should have responded as I did

10:31.339 --> 10:35.918
whenever someone tried to hand me
some stupid responsibility when I was alive.

10:36.052 --> 10:41.343
I should have said, "Thanks, but I prefer not to."
Polite, firm, hard to argue with.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.727
I'll take hi...

10:56.531 --> 10:59.651
And then it was just the two of us.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.705
I wanted to tell JD
that he'd be better off without me.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.699
And even though that sounded
like some sappy break-up line,

11:09.836 --> 11:12.042
it really was the truth.

11:12.172 --> 11:16.798
The fact is, I had a rather sordid past
when it came to animals.

11:16.926 --> 11:22.347
That probably sounds like I used to
molest them, but it was nothing like that.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.428
I actually loved every pet I ever had.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.596
First there was my mouse,
Speedy Gonzales.

11:28.730 --> 11:33.558
I fed him a jalapeÃ±o because it seemed
only natural that he would like them.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.443
Mom!

11:38.573 --> 11:40.482
He didn't.

11:40.617 --> 11:44.828
After Speedy Gonzales passed away,
I was on the rebound hard.

11:44.954 --> 11:49.166
There was a void. I told my mom
only a new puppy could fill it.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.700
Happy Easter, sweetheart.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.463
- This isn't a dog.
- A dog is a lot of responsibility.

11:58.593 --> 12:02.507
- You don't think I can take care of a dog?
- Not true.

12:02.639 --> 12:07.716
But this Easter chick needs a mom
and I think you're the best girl for the job.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.512
I named my chick Tweety.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.979
The problem was
our cat, Sylvester, ate Tweety.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.192
And promptly choked to death.

12:25.328 --> 12:28.199
It was grisly scene -
possibly a murder/suicide pact.

12:28.331 --> 12:32.792
I don't know what the fuck happened.
I never really made peace with it.

12:32.919 --> 12:38.162
It went on and on like that. The more
I loved my pets, the quicker I killed them.

12:39.217 --> 12:43.760
Which is why it wasn't for purely
selfish reasons that I wanted to lose JD.

12:43.888 --> 12:49.227
His demise would be sure and swift
and I knew somehow I'd be the cause of it.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.139
Frankly, I had enough guilt and regret

12:52.272 --> 12:55.641
without adding the death
of this beautiful dog to the mix.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.562
Come on, JD. Let's go home.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.664
What the fuck is wrong with you?

13:33.897 --> 13:39.900
Daisy, I've been thinking about earning
some extra cash by doing all this acting stuff.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.151
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.985
In fact, you could give me a few pointers.

13:45.116 --> 13:48.900
You could come over,
we could read some scenes together.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.287
- That kind of stuff.
- I don't see that happening.

13:52.415 --> 13:57.124
Daisy, this is not some cheap move.
I had my first audition yesterday.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.457
- What was it for?
- Some beer advertisement.

14:00.590 --> 14:06.842
The notice said young, like 20s,
hip, good-looking, so come on...

14:07.889 --> 14:10.760
- How did it go?
- I didn't get it.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.893
Don't be discouraged.
I'm sure it was the accent.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.772
It was a print ad, so you didn't speak.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.816
Then the accent's not a problem.
What a gorgeous dog.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.778
- Isn't she?
- Is it a golden?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.482
Yes, she is.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.532
- What's its name?
- JD.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.066
- JD's a male.
- Yes, she is.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.611
Why are you calling him a she?

14:32.747 --> 14:36.496
Because dogs are referred to
in the feminine.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.295
- Like a guy talks about a car?
- Exactly.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.256
- "She gets 20 to the gallon"?
- Sure.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.593
Actually, you refer to dogs by their sex
as in "Here, boy. Down, girl."

14:50.765 --> 14:53.600
It's not her dog.

14:53.727 --> 14:57.855
Yeah. I picked up on that.
Who does JD belong to?

14:57.981 --> 15:02.310
- You mean who did she belong to.
- Please don't tell me this was her dog.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.904
OK, folks. How many times
can I fucking say this?

15:10.493 --> 15:13.613
Do not get emotionally involved
with these people.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.823
Just do your job.

15:15.957 --> 15:19.825
- Hey, get the dog out of my restaurant!
- It's out. I'm sorry.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.626
You are killing me. Just do the job.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.425
What is his problem?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.677
Wow.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.156
Pay the check.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.375
- Hey.
- So what does JD stand for?

16:02.504 --> 16:06.336
I don't know.
Maybe his owner was a boozer.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.628
Maybe JD stands for Jack Daniels.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.514
You took her soul. What did you see?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.724
I don't think
she named him Jack Daniels.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.971
He's your dog now.
You should figure it out.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.604
I'm gonna take a walk.
I'll see you later, peanut.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.979
"Just do the job".
Like we were hit men.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.776
Don't get emotionally involved.
Clean your gun, go home.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.986
I guess that's what those guys did.

16:36.121 --> 16:40.118
But what we did for a living -
what we did for the living -

16:40.250 --> 16:42.538
was not as easy.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.539
Death happened. It happened a lot.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.044
And it happened randomly.

16:48.174 --> 16:52.836
Chances were you were going
to know someone who was about to die.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.343
The sheer numbers kinda
calmed me down about JD.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.845
I decided that even though
this dog would die some day,

17:01.980 --> 17:04.732
nothing would hurt him while he was with me.

17:04.858 --> 17:09.852
I mean, I wasn't the only kid
who had accidentally offed a pet.

17:09.988 --> 17:14.068
My little sister
was just as star-crossed as I was.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.734
Reggie had already
blown through an aquarium full of fish

17:17.871 --> 17:20.278
and now had moved on to mammals.

17:20.415 --> 17:25.409
Wherever Silverberg is now,
I'm sure he forgives you.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.996
I mean, he was nothing if not reasonable.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.457
Hey. What's for dinner?

17:33.803 --> 17:36.674
Oh. Did we lose somebody?

17:37.724 --> 17:41.057
Actually, yes.
We had a little accident here.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.890
Reggie thought
she'd teach the gerbil to swim.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.228
Why teach a gerbil to swim?

17:46.358 --> 17:49.442
Mom said that everybody
needs to know how to swim.

17:49.569 --> 17:54.397
Yes, sweetie, but throwing him in
the toilet's a rather tough-love approach.

18:00.872 --> 18:04.952
- I didn't even know she had a gerbil.
- There's a shocker.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.540
And so it began for Reggie.

18:07.671 --> 18:11.964
Things she cared about suddenly
began to disappear from her life.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.297
- How was everything?
- Oh, it was just fine.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.302
He's in a better mood this afternoon.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.815
I enjoyed your eggs very much.
Thank you.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.852
You're welcome.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.824
Oh, shit!

19:34.632 --> 19:36.672
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

19:36.801 --> 19:39.755
- Going into my apartment.
- I mean, the dog.

19:39.888 --> 19:45.013
- The dog's going in too.
- Georgia, this is a small space we share.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.559
Share?
I can't believe she knew the word.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.689
- So?
- Well...

19:51.816 --> 19:57.522
I know this isn't something you care about,
but I own some beautiful clothes.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.989
- What's your point?
- He looks like a shedder.

20:01.117 --> 20:06.622
- That's something I can live with.
- Truth is I'm wildly allergic to dogs.

20:06.748 --> 20:10.448
"Wildly allergic"?
Seems you might have started with that.

20:10.585 --> 20:14.749
I don't like talking about my flaws.
Thanks for understanding.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.252
Oh, yes. I'll see you later.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.712
If she's allergic, why did she pet you?

20:32.607 --> 20:36.901
JD and I wandered through the park
for the better part of an afternoon.

20:37.028 --> 20:41.856
The kind of wandering that takes place
when you didn't have to be anywhere.

20:41.991 --> 20:47.330
But, in our hearts, both JD and I knew
we were just killing time.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.662
And we needed a home.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.802
What? No, no, no...

21:04.931 --> 21:09.225
And if a home
was a place where you felt comfortable...

21:09.352 --> 21:11.428
.. this was not it.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.686
Yeah.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.226
Whoa...

21:29.414 --> 21:31.288
Millie? Millie.

21:31.416 --> 21:34.168
I'm working. Oh...

21:35.503 --> 21:38.173
This is so not cool.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.998
Neither is catching Zs on the J-O-B.

21:42.135 --> 21:46.346
- Oh.
- Is there something I need to know?

21:46.473 --> 21:49.592
No. I'm good. Just a little tired.

21:49.726 --> 21:54.684
A tired worker is a poor worker.
A poor worker is often an out-of-work worker.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.059
What's going on?

21:56.191 --> 21:59.275
I have this dog.
My roommate says she's allergic.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.652
I'm staying with this guy, but he's kinda...

22:02.781 --> 22:05.153
Skeevy?

22:05.283 --> 22:07.240
- English.
- Eeugh.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.413
- What kind of doggie?
- Golden retriever.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.366
Lovely companions.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.747
Why don't you stay with me for a while
while you figure things out?

22:17.879 --> 22:23.834
Oh, that's very generous of you, Delores,
but I'll be fine. I'll take care of things.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.045
I'm sure you will.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.932
You have a Post-it on your forehead.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.765
So he choked to death.

22:39.693 --> 22:43.524
I've never had a choker.
I can't imagine it's very pretty.

22:43.655 --> 22:47.403
It isn't. I couldn't even look this time.
I took off.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.321
I feel terrible, just terrible.

22:50.453 --> 22:54.617
A shot through the heart.
I was here. Didn't even see him go down.

22:54.749 --> 22:59.577
- Yup. Poor guy.
- Choked on a ham sandwich.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.832
- Just like Mama Cass.
- Just like Mama Cass.

23:02.966 --> 23:08.209
- I sure wish I'd heard him sputtering.
- Why? You know the Heimlich?

23:08.346 --> 23:13.055
No. I got Roberto in there cooking.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.019
- The boy can't even fry an egg.
- The bus boy?

23:16.146 --> 23:20.689
What else am I supposed to do?
It's not like Angus gave me notice.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.977
Casey, I know how to cook.
I know how to cook very well.

23:26.114 --> 23:29.115
- In a diner?
- Burn one on the hoof, hold the bread.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.777
I'm a gifted man.
Why are you looking for somebody?

23:33.997 --> 23:38.789
Well, anybody's better than what I got.
I can't speak Spanish.

23:39.794 --> 23:42.997
- Go. Vamoose.
- Yes.

23:52.557 --> 23:55.392
It's all yours. I don't need this bullshit.

23:55.518 --> 23:59.219
And I'm a fucking citizen, dude.
Speak English.

24:01.524 --> 24:04.194
Got the sand, got the sea dust,
got mud...

24:04.319 --> 24:08.269
Just call it coffee. Don't call it mud.
It'll only confuse people.

24:08.406 --> 24:11.775
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Neither are you.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.743
Work was unbearable that day.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.950
Not just because it was work,

24:20.085 --> 24:24.378
but because I didn't know
what was going on with JD and Mason.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.746
Thanks.

24:26.883 --> 24:29.884
Mason said
he would take care of him,

24:30.011 --> 24:32.549
but I wasn't sure what that meant.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.681
I wondered what he was doing with my dog.

24:35.809 --> 24:39.308
Then the guy dog says to the girl dog,

24:39.437 --> 24:43.933
"I don't know what the hell you rolled in
tonight, but it smells lovely!"

24:45.777 --> 24:47.319
Whoo!

24:48.279 --> 24:51.150
So maybe it didn't make any sense,

24:51.282 --> 24:57.368
but I didn't like the idea of Mason using
my dog for some evil scheme to bag women.

24:57.497 --> 25:00.332
That's right. My dog.

25:00.458 --> 25:04.373
I knew something had to be done.
Something drastic.

25:05.422 --> 25:09.550
Good timing. I was just
about to start the last Hot Pocket.

25:09.676 --> 25:13.127
Don't let me do it no matter how much I beg.

25:13.263 --> 25:17.047
- Come on in.
- Thanks for letting us stay here.

25:17.183 --> 25:22.178
Well, you're not the first strays
to find shelter at Chez Delores.

25:22.313 --> 25:26.145
God knows I've taken in
my fair share of drifters.

25:26.276 --> 25:32.029
Shame about the homeless. They are
passionate lovers, but they rob you blind.

25:32.157 --> 25:37.827
I'm not gonna rob you, I just don't
exactly know where home is these days.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.243
Stay as long as you like.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.327
You know what they say,
home is where the Herbig.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.958
- Would you like a tour?
- Sure.

25:47.088 --> 25:50.789
Well, it's actually more of a twirl.
This is it.

25:50.925 --> 25:54.757
It's nice. Clean.

25:54.888 --> 25:57.924
I like to look at every inch
as an opportunity.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.968
Delores, where's your cat?

26:01.102 --> 26:04.020
Murray? How sweet to remember.

26:04.147 --> 26:07.598
Murray's away.
Dialysis, three days a week.

26:08.777 --> 26:11.149
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.735
This is my snooze bin.

26:13.865 --> 26:17.068
Hope you don't mind my night sweats.

26:17.202 --> 26:20.156
Kidding! Those ended weeks ago.

26:20.288 --> 26:25.033
Over here is where I puzzle.
I got a real head-scratcher here.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.326
Tonight we make a big push.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.538
And over here...

26:31.007 --> 26:32.881
This is central ops.

26:33.009 --> 26:37.303
This is where I make my "to do" lists,
but the doing happens all over.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.217
Are you a doer in the home, Millie?

26:40.350 --> 26:42.841
I'm more of a TV watcher.

26:42.977 --> 26:45.765
Well, you came to the wrong place,
lazybones.

26:45.897 --> 26:49.147
You take a couple of seconds
to get your bearings

26:49.275 --> 26:53.024
and then you and I
are gonna be busy little beavers.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.406
Damn it!

27:16.928 --> 27:18.885
- Your PCs are bubbling.
- What?

27:19.014 --> 27:21.469
Your pancakes. I'll get 'em.

27:25.687 --> 27:29.767
Flip 'em over before the bubbles burst
or they lose their elasticity.

27:29.899 --> 27:32.058
- Flip 'em, not flop 'em.
- I'm flipping.

27:32.193 --> 27:34.151
- You're flopping.
- So what?

27:34.279 --> 27:37.979
If you don't know, we're knee-deep in water.
Plate 'em.

27:44.205 --> 27:47.621
- Time! You're breaking my heart.
- It's a three stack.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.874
- Axle grease 'em.
- Pardon?

27:50.003 --> 27:53.372
Butter! You're killing me.
Butter is elemental.

27:53.506 --> 27:57.504
- I've been eating them for 20 years.
- That's all you know how to do.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.506
- Don't drown 'em.
- Fucking butter on pancakes.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.212
If that's your attitude... Check, please!

28:03.350 --> 28:07.181
You gotta criticise and teach
in the same breath.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.554
Please, no finger painting.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.727
I'm giving you wisdom,
an ancient Chinese secret,

28:13.860 --> 28:19.020
recipes that have been passed down
that originated on the moors of Scotland.

28:19.157 --> 28:22.360
Banana Bonanza originated
on the moors of Scotland?

28:22.494 --> 28:23.739
Eggs!

28:26.414 --> 28:27.956
- Run zippo.
- What?

28:28.083 --> 28:30.324
Spoon with the holes.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.829
It's called the line
because it's like being on the front.

28:33.963 --> 28:38.293
Every soft egg that turns hard
is like a soldier that died in your arms.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.502
Dang. Another man down.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.923
Dang. Another man down.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.060
Rest in peace.

28:49.771 --> 28:54.397
I like leaving folded laundry out
for a moment before I drawer it.

28:54.526 --> 28:58.060
Let it breathe. Hey, don't quit on me now.

28:58.196 --> 29:01.814
The night is young
and there's much to be done.

29:01.950 --> 29:06.659
And that's what it's all about -
getting things done.

29:07.497 --> 29:12.657
Hey, how about we lay some new
contact paper on the cabinet shelves?

29:12.794 --> 29:14.336
Come on.

29:17.799 --> 29:22.046
I couldn't decide between Ferns & Flowers
and Country Rose so I got both.

29:22.178 --> 29:25.049
What do you like?

29:30.520 --> 29:33.723
Oh. Did you put detergent
in the dishwasher?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.976
- No. I thought you did.
- Oh, silly us.

29:37.110 --> 29:40.277
We'll have to locate those dishes
and wash them again.

29:40.405 --> 29:44.983
- The computer told you that?
- No. Stinky 5,000 told me that.

29:45.118 --> 29:49.163
Looks like he's also voting
for Ferns & Flowers.

29:51.499 --> 29:56.208
- Who's voting?
- Oh, my gosh! Didn't I tell you?

29:56.338 --> 29:58.414
I have my own website.

29:58.548 --> 30:01.419
"Getting things done with Delores".

30:01.551 --> 30:03.876
No fucking way.

30:04.012 --> 30:07.962
We live in a society that speeds along
and with people so busy,

30:08.099 --> 30:11.468
character-building chores
just fall by the wayside.

30:11.603 --> 30:14.806
So people like watching me
getting things done.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.727
There's a camera there...

30:17.859 --> 30:20.397
.. and there... and there... and there.

30:20.528 --> 30:25.107
But not in the bathroom. Folks looking
at me on the potty would be wrong.

30:25.241 --> 30:29.286
While watching her
everywhere else is just plain insane.

30:29.412 --> 30:32.828
I was thinking
about calling it Herbig Website,

30:32.957 --> 30:38.414
but I was worried I'd attract people
with a fetish for, you know... big things.

30:39.631 --> 30:44.293
So people actually pay to watch you?

30:44.427 --> 30:46.835
I get two cents when someone clicks on,

30:46.971 --> 30:51.016
but that all goes straight
to the American Amputee Association.

30:51.142 --> 30:54.262
Oh, Christ.
My boss has a wooden leg.

30:54.396 --> 30:57.432
My good friend,
Rebecca Randall, climbed Everest.

30:57.565 --> 31:02.062
She made the summit,
but lost all ten little Indians.

31:02.195 --> 31:05.362
She keeps tipping over.
No balance, poor dear.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.024
Oh!

31:09.160 --> 31:12.695
Hungry Girl
wants to know the dog's name.

31:12.831 --> 31:16.116
- Um, JD.
- And what does the JD stand for?

31:17.210 --> 31:19.748
I don't know.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.046
Well, enough chatting.
We gotta get things done.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.212
Oh.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.527
So he didn't cross over.

31:47.991 --> 31:51.360
What a pain in the ass.
What do you think happened?

31:52.412 --> 31:54.488
I have no clue.

31:57.792 --> 32:01.576
- You like baseball?
- Not really.

32:01.713 --> 32:05.461
- I did once blow Babe Ruth.
- Who didn't?

32:06.509 --> 32:11.467
Pitcher pitches, batter doesn't swing,
umpire doesn't say anything.

32:11.598 --> 32:14.848
Batter says,
"So what was it? Ball or strike?"

32:14.976 --> 32:18.013
Umpire says, "It ain't nothing till I call it."

32:18.146 --> 32:22.475
This fucking guy
has been called out on strikes.

32:22.609 --> 32:27.152
- And won't get out of the batter's box.
- Won't get out of the box.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.736
Cheeseburger. Try not to fuck it up.

32:31.201 --> 32:33.774
See the way he talks to me?

32:33.912 --> 32:35.287
Yeah.

32:37.999 --> 32:42.163
The thought that people
were watching me kept me awake.

32:42.295 --> 32:47.716
I couldn't help wondering who liked
to watch Delores "getting things done".

32:47.842 --> 32:51.543
What were those people getting done
while they were watching?

32:51.680 --> 32:54.799
Oh, baby, dry those dishes. Uh-huh.

32:54.933 --> 32:57.887
Dry them. Make them squeaky clean.

32:59.229 --> 33:03.689
Oh, yeah... Use the hand towel. Oh, yeah.

33:04.734 --> 33:08.186
I needed
to find a place to sleep.

33:19.582 --> 33:21.824
What?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.371
Don't say a word.

33:23.503 --> 33:26.587
It's my life, my apartment, my dog!

33:26.715 --> 33:32.219
You're the guest and if you don't like it,
you can kiss my dead ass goodbye.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.801
Are we clear?

33:34.931 --> 33:38.799
And you. A dog in a hot tub?

33:38.935 --> 33:41.343
That's just sick.

33:49.988 --> 33:52.905
- A dog in a hot tub?
- No clue.

33:58.204 --> 34:01.953
- Not bad?
- Come on. That is spot-on. It's Michelangelo.

34:03.293 --> 34:05.001
Load 'em.

34:05.128 --> 34:08.877
Guy wants the cheese
melted on the bread, not the patty, and kraut.

34:09.007 --> 34:11.793
- Fine.
- No, no. That's how it starts.

34:11.926 --> 34:17.134
You give in, next you're making a rib-eye,
well done, smothered in ketchup.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.219
- You're being melodramatic.
- I'm not!

34:20.351 --> 34:21.893
I'm not talking to you.

34:22.020 --> 34:25.353
- I'm not paying for it.
- Oh, you pay for it.

34:25.482 --> 34:28.268
Sending back a dish is a hostile act.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.817
Are you going to take orders
from a fucking customer?

34:43.375 --> 34:46.329
Hey. How are you doing?
You order a patty melt?

34:46.460 --> 34:50.922
- Yeah. Is there a problem?
- You don't know what a patty melt is.

34:51.049 --> 34:55.510
A patty melt not only implies
what it is but also how it's prepared.

34:55.637 --> 34:59.848
- The cheese is melted on the patty.
- I like the cheese on the bread.

34:59.974 --> 35:04.103
That'd be a grilled cheese.
How about I make you a grilled cheese?

35:04.229 --> 35:08.309
I want a patty melt with kraut
and cheese melted on the bread.

35:10.235 --> 35:13.105
Sorry. I can't do that.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.609
What do you mean?

35:15.740 --> 35:22.870
Well, you give in on one little thing,
you compromise and compromise...

35:22.997 --> 35:26.865
until you're a shell of a man
beaten down and you stand for nothing.

35:27.919 --> 35:30.457
I want to talk to the manager.

35:32.048 --> 35:36.260
A dish is a collection
of flavours, consistencies.

35:36.386 --> 35:42.175
Start swapping ingredients and it's like
fucking with a Jenga tower of tastes.

35:42.308 --> 35:46.140
- You don't know what you're asking for.
- I know.

35:46.271 --> 35:50.019
Kraut on Der Patty Melt
is akin to knocking the tower down.

35:50.150 --> 35:52.475
"Der Patty Melt" should have kraut on it.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.611
"Der" is German for "the".

35:57.240 --> 36:01.154
The Waffle House. The patty melt.

36:02.537 --> 36:06.120
I want der fucking patty melt
with der cheese melted on der bread

36:06.249 --> 36:08.407
with der fucking kraut on it. Got it?

36:13.590 --> 36:17.089
No, you got it. On der house.

36:26.269 --> 36:30.481
Fucked with the wrong cook today,
eh, Angus? Angus?

36:33.902 --> 36:36.653
Who are you talking to back here?

36:37.697 --> 36:40.782
Me? No one.

36:40.909 --> 36:45.950
I got a new guy coming in today,
who worked at Ihop, so he's really good.

36:46.081 --> 36:48.619
That's great.

36:48.750 --> 36:52.748
So this'll be your last shift
and I wanna thank you for helping out.

36:52.879 --> 36:55.168
You're welcome.

36:55.298 --> 36:58.750
I could help you
show the new guy the ropes.

37:00.345 --> 37:04.639
I mean, the oven's
always 25 degrees hotter than it reads.

37:05.725 --> 37:10.019
When he does his Belgian waffles,
you know the trick? Vanilla.

37:10.146 --> 37:13.729
Pinch of nutmeg.
Makes it taste like Christmas all year.

37:13.858 --> 37:18.022
Boy, you didn't just eat here.
You really watched Angus cook.

37:18.863 --> 37:21.568
Yeah. Man had a gift.

37:39.426 --> 37:43.554
- Millie. May I have a moment?
- Sure.

37:46.808 --> 37:50.177
This is difficult to say. Especially now.

37:50.311 --> 37:55.816
I always find it hard to maintain authority
after I've shared a bed with someone.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.271
Sure.

37:57.402 --> 38:02.693
I printed the postings from
the "Getting Things Done With Delores" website

38:02.824 --> 38:08.163
and I'm sorry to say the response
to your visit was not what I hoped.

38:08.288 --> 38:09.319
Delores...

38:09.456 --> 38:16.205
Pure Attitude 477 described you
as "lethargic and uninspiring" and, uh...

38:16.338 --> 38:21.628
Truth Machine 8 said he went to bed
feeling nothing had been accomplished.

38:21.760 --> 38:27.465
- Millie, this just won't do.
- Listen, don't worry about kicking me out.

38:27.599 --> 38:32.095
I just think there might be a better environment
for you some place else.

38:32.228 --> 38:37.223
Some place slower, where you can
get things done at your own pace.

38:38.985 --> 38:42.769
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

38:42.906 --> 38:48.991
Maybe this is the spark you need to
light a fire under that ass you like to sit on.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.658
If you'll excuse me.

38:51.790 --> 38:56.416
There's a Hot Pocket in the microwave
calling my name. Don't try to stop me.

39:01.633 --> 39:05.168
JD and I wandered
through the park one last time

39:05.303 --> 39:07.343
before I took him home.

39:07.472 --> 39:10.888
I think some people wander
because that's who they are.

39:11.017 --> 39:14.351
Wandering is what gives them oxygen.

39:14.479 --> 39:17.895
It's the wandering
that allows them to live.

39:18.024 --> 39:21.974
I was beginning to think
that that's the kind of person I was.

39:22.112 --> 39:26.489
The kind of person
for whom one job, one love,

39:26.616 --> 39:30.115
even one life,
wasn't going to be enough to hold me.

39:31.496 --> 39:35.790
Then there are those who wander
because they don't have a place to go -

39:35.917 --> 39:38.455
to call home.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.959
So I took JD home.

39:53.518 --> 39:56.223
Come on. Stay.

39:57.272 --> 40:00.226
You be good. You be good, JD.

40:04.612 --> 40:07.448
Stay. You stay.

40:07.574 --> 40:09.116
Stay.

40:15.999 --> 40:18.075
And who are you?

40:20.378 --> 40:22.537
"JD".

40:22.672 --> 40:24.914
Are you lost, JD?

40:34.517 --> 40:38.562
All right. You can come in. Come on.

40:38.688 --> 40:43.267
Maybe that's what happens
to some souls. Maybe they get lost.

40:43.401 --> 40:47.565
Maybe they have to wander
because they're not quite at peace yet.

40:48.740 --> 40:53.117
Maybe there's some kind of
unfinished business with these souls.

40:53.244 --> 40:57.871
Like they're holding on to something.
Holding their breath.

40:57.999 --> 41:01.997
And when the business is done,
they can finally let go,

41:02.128 --> 41:05.414
exhale... and sleep.

41:10.095 --> 41:12.633
The dog's in the bed.

41:13.807 --> 41:17.970
- Will the dog be sleeping in the bed?
- Maybe.

41:18.103 --> 41:21.353
- Will you be sleeping in the bed?
- Maybe.

41:23.191 --> 41:25.314
What do you think JD stands for?

41:25.443 --> 41:27.270
Just Dog.

41:28.988 --> 41:30.780
I kinda like that.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.357
Get the dog off the bed, Reggie.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.743
That was my mother.

42:59.913 --> 43:01.905
