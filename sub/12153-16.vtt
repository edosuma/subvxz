My name.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.099
You would presume to speak my name?

01:04.099 --> 01:09.200
<i>Because I am returned in the body of a human,</i>
<i>you think you can speak to me.</i>

01:09.200 --> 01:11.700
- It's disgusting.
- Who is Winifred Burkle?

01:13.700 --> 01:18.100
I thought the humans would
have long died out by now.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.700
Instead you've grown bold.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.100
- So you don't know who Fred is?
- Nor care.

Yes.

We are.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.100
Oh.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.000
Now I remember.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.100
Winifred Burkle is the shell I'm in.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.600
She's the woman you killed.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.100
This is grief.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.100
I'm watching human grief.
It's like offal in my mouth.

02:52.700 --> 02:57.400
If you stay here, you'll taste it
every day, every second.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.500
Look. Humans rule the Earth.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.600
<i>They will last for millennia...</i>

03:04.600 --> 03:08.000
<i>like roaches crawling everywhere...</i>

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
crying and sweating...

03:10.000 --> 03:12.400
and puking their feelings all over you.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.000
Go back.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.600
Sleep until the humans are gone.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.000
They are stupid and weak.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.900
They'll kill each other off...

by humans...

03:50.400 --> 03:52.900
then I have work to do.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.300
Can't even get drunk.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.500
Why would anyone ever make
a bottle this small?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.300
It's inhuman.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.700
Thousands would have died
if we'd saved her.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.300
Yeah.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.600
[ Sighs ]
Yeah.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.300
I tried calling Wes.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.100
There's no answer.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.700
Guess she's gone then.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.800
It's like a bloody tease.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.800
It's, like, here's what
a bottle ofJack would look like...

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
if you actually had one.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.300
Or here's a drink,
but it's very far away.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.700
<i>What does that mean, really?</i>

04:54.700 --> 04:57.300
It's a play on perspective.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.300
Gone. Wh-What does it mean,
that she's gone?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.700
Well, in the world of men,
a person dies, they stay that way.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.900
- Unless you're a vampire.
- Or the ghost of one that saved the world.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.700
Or Buffy.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.000
Death doesn't have to be the end,
not in our world.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.400
Rules can be broken.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.400
All you have to do
is push hard enough.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.000
<i>- Gonna torture him?</i>
- Thinkin' about it.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.500
Can I help?
I'm really good at it.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.800
Thanks,
but this is kind of personal.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.500
Why do you think I wanna help?
Because I've got some kind of blood lust?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.800
Well, okay, that too,
but Fred's my friend.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.900
We went out for drinks
all the-- once.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.700
And if Poindexter here had anything to do
with hurting her...

05:42.700 --> 05:45.200
then I'm in for a big,
fat pound of flesh!

05:45.200 --> 05:47.100
Angel?

05:47.100 --> 05:49.400
He's on his way back. How's Fred?

05:49.400 --> 05:52.900
- You tied Knox up.
- We're gonna torture him.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.000
Good. Why?

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
He knows what's happening. Been hiding it the
whole time. I just need a few minutes alone.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.900
- He's involved in this?
- Pretty sure.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.600
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Yeah, buddy. Why didn't you?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.500
- Shut up!
- I thought we wanted him to talk.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.600

- Doesn't matter anymore. Fred's gone.

It's not what you think.

It's-- It's beautiful.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.200
Tell them.
Tell them what happened.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.400
The infection--

06:33.400 --> 06:36.300
Illyria consumed her...

06:36.300 --> 06:38.100
took over her body.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.000
Then it's still Fred, right?
This thing is just controlling--

06:44.300 --> 06:46.300
She's... gone.

06:46.300 --> 06:49.100
- You don't know that.
<i>- Wait. I'm confused.</i>

06:49.100 --> 06:51.400
It looks like Fred, but it's not?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.800
<i>She's so much more than that now.</i>
<i>Beyond flesh.</i>

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
<i>Beyond perfection.</i>

06:58.100 --> 07:00.900
I loved Fred. I really did.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.800
<i>She had a warmth</i>
<i>that took you in and held you...</i>

07:04.800 --> 07:08.600

07:12.900 --> 07:14.700
<i>I ever met.</i>

07:16.600 --> 07:19.300
That's why I chose her.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.600
She's the only one that was worthy.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.800
Wes, don't.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.900
- We need him. I know how you feel.
- You know--

07:29.000 --> 07:31.300
You didn't feel her die.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.700
She was shaking with pain
and terrified and so brave.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.300
She was better
than anyone I've known.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.100
Better than--

07:46.800 --> 07:48.600
She's gone.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.900
<i>I know.</i>

07:53.900 --> 07:55.900
Now let's get her back.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.500
- So that's it? England was a bust?
- Not entirely.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.500
We found out where the sarcophagus came from.
There were thousands of'em.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.300
- Minus one.
- What about this Drogyn character?
He wouldn't help?

08:04.300 --> 08:06.200
He couldn't.
We were too late.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.000
I should have seen it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.800
<i>Knox. He sang for me,</i>
<i>and I should have seen this.</i>

08:11.800 --> 08:16.600
- It's not your fault.
- If I'd concentrated harder,
read him better, maybe Fred--

08:16.600 --> 08:18.600
There's a lot we might have done...

08:18.600 --> 08:21.200
starting with never coming
to Wolfram and Hart in the first place.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.600
We can beat ourselves up over it later,
but right now--

08:23.600 --> 08:28.300
<i>I'm sorry, Angelcakes.</i>
<i>I-- I got nothin´</i>

08:29.600 --> 08:31.500

08:31.500 --> 08:34.400
- [ Sighs ] Lorne!
- No, let him go.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.799
If he's doubting himself,
he won't be any good to us.

08:36.799 --> 08:40.200
Lorne's right.
We should have seen this coming.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.100
Wouldn't have made a difference. Drogyn said
the sarcophagus was preordained to be released.

08:44.100 --> 08:47.000
Nothing could have
stopped it from arriving.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.600
That's not completely true.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.000
I played a round of piñata with lab boy
while you were gone.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.500
<i>The sarcophagus</i>
<i>was stuck in Customs...</i>

08:55.500 --> 08:59.400

08:59.400 --> 09:01.200
Who?

09:04.800 --> 09:08.300
- I'm working on it.
- Oh. You're working on it.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.500
Good for you, Charles.
Not a moment to lose.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.200
<i>[ Angel ] Wes. I know you're hurting.</i>
<i>Keep your footing.</i>

09:13.200 --> 09:16.500

09:16.500 --> 09:18.900
- There is no Fred anymore.
- You don't know that.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.400
I watched it gut her
from the inside out.

09:21.400 --> 09:25.400
<i>Everything she was is gone.</i>
<i>There is nothing left but a shell.</i>

09:25.600 --> 09:27.700
Then we'll figure out a way
to fill it back up.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.000
The thing only took over her body.
Just the tip of the theological.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.800
It's the soul that matters.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.900
Trust us.
We're kind of experts.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.000
What about her--
if her organs have been liquefied?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.600
Flash fried in a pillar of fire,
saving the world.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.600

You really believe there's a chance
of bringing her back?

- We need the big guns.

- Willow.
- Won't be the first time she rattled the dead.

Last time I heard,
she was in South America.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.200
We'll track her down
and get her here as soon as we can.

we need to contain Illyria.

That's why you were called to me.
We're bound together.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.100
We know what you are, Illyria.
We've seen the rest of your kind.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.300
All the Old Ones,
sealed away forever...

14:14.300 --> 14:17.800
like you were,
where you should have stayed.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.500
<i>You've taken something of ours...</i>

14:20.500 --> 14:22.400
<i>something very precious.</i>

14:22.400 --> 14:25.400
Stand down, and I promise...

14:25.400 --> 14:28.900
we won't destroy you taking it back.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.100
Your choice.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
I decline.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.500
<i>[ Gunn ]</i>
<i>Take her.!</i>

15:04.800 --> 15:06.800
[ Groaning ]

15:13.900 --> 15:15.800
<i>[ Bell Dings ]</i>

15:15.800 --> 15:18.200
Sorry, boss. Maybe if I'd stopped her
back in Gunn's office--

15:18.200 --> 15:20.200
- Did she toss you out a window?
- No.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.200
- Then you're one up on me. Hey, what do you got?
- Smoke and mirrors.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.800
- No trace of either of them.
<i>- [ Gunn ] Put tactical on Code Black.</i>

15:25.800 --> 15:28.600
- If Illyria shows up again--
- She won't. She got what she came for.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.700
- Knox?
- And some spiffy new threads.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.000
- Any idea how she got past you?
- One second she was standing there,
the next, poof.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.100
- She's a teleporter.
<i>- [ Wesley ] I don't think so.</i>

15:36.100 --> 15:38.800
No characteristic displacement
of the atmosphere around her.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.600
I fancied I saw a blur
just before she went Houdini.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.500
Like she was pulling a Barry Allen.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.800
Jay Garrick? Wally--

15:47.800 --> 15:51.800
- She was moving really fast.
- Or we were moving very slow.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.000
- Great. She's superstrong, and she can alter time.
- Well, that's not fair.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.800
It makes it complicated,
but doesn't change what we need to do.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.800
Wes, take the lab apart, check Knox's files,
the sarcophagus, anything to help get Fred back.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.400
Come on. I got a degree
in tearing things up.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.300
Never a truer word.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.000
I got a few contacts I could try,
see if anything shakes loose.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.400
Great. Do it. Let's see if we can track her
down, figure out where she's headed.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.400
Any thoughts on how we're
supposed to track Fred?

16:15.400 --> 16:18.300
Or Illyria?
Or whatever the hell that thing was?

16:18.300 --> 16:21.400
We just do it. That's all.

16:21.400 --> 16:25.800
<i>Back in the lab, she was standing</i>
<i>right there in front of me...</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:28.400
<i>but there was no scent, nothing.</i>

16:30.200 --> 16:32.800
It was like she wasn't even there.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.600
I know.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.500
Look...

16:40.500 --> 16:44.500
I want Fred back
as much as any of us...

16:44.500 --> 16:47.700
but seeing her there like that--

16:49.300 --> 16:51.600
- Maybe she really is--
- No.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.200
I lost Cordelia because
some <i>thing</i> violated her...

16:55.200 --> 16:58.900
<i>crawled inside, used her up.</i>

16:58.900 --> 17:01.000
No way in hell...

17:01.000 --> 17:03.800
am I letting that happen again.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.400
I never trusted that little nerd.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.099
The rumpled hair,
socks that didn't match...

17:11.099 --> 17:13.700
that cute, lopsided grin.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.800
So totally playing it up.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.099
I mean, who did he think
he was fooling?

17:18.099 --> 17:21.099
<i>Besides all of us.</i>

17:21.099 --> 17:24.500
Um, shouldn't you be wearing
one of those...

17:24.500 --> 17:26.599
moon suits?

17:26.599 --> 17:29.900
- I think this has done all the damage it's going to.
- Right.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.300
Mind if I put one on?

17:34.500 --> 17:37.000
She was curious.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.800
That's why Fred didn't put it
into containment immediately.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.000
How things work.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.400
What makes them special.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.900
<i>She was always searching</i>
<i>for what other people couldn't see.</i>

17:55.400 --> 17:57.600
She was just curious.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.300
I think I hate her a little for that.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.100
- Wes.
- Hand me the pry bar.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.600
The girl of your dreams loved you.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.300
That's more than most people ever get.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.500
I know...

18:26.500 --> 18:29.100
but it isn't enough.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.500
Wes! Stop it!

18:35.500 --> 18:37.900
Wes!

18:39.200 --> 18:42.400
Appreciate the urge to smash,
but that's not helping.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.900
No.

18:47.900 --> 18:51.000
- But this might.
- I thought that was supposed to
be unbreakable or something.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Time.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.300
The markings refer to a series
of concussively timed intervals.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.100
This gem is the focal point
of the sarcophagus.

19:04.100 --> 19:07.000
It might be useful,
if it isn't already drained.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.300
Got me beat. All I found was
a cell phone and a cheese sandwich.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.400
Was it Knox's?

19:12.400 --> 19:16.200
It had his name written on the bag,
with a little smiley face in the ''O,'' the big girl.

19:16.200 --> 19:20.200
- The cell phone, Harmony.
- Oh. Um, I think so.

19:20.400 --> 19:25.600
Got a Rick Springfield screen saver,
which opens up a whole new set of questions.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.000
<i>- [ Phone Beeping ]</i>
- Outgoing numbers have all been deleted.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.500
Same for incoming calls.

19:33.500 --> 19:37.400
[ Sighs ]
What about missed calls?

19:37.400 --> 19:41.100
Knox couldn't have erased them
if he didn't have his lady phone on him.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.400
Three in the last few hours...

19:44.400 --> 19:46.900
all from the same person.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.900
Always messy
when you have to open them up.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.200
That's why I prefer
the less invasive procedures.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.600
Never got used to the sight of blood.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.900
Ugh. Still makes me nauseous.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.500
Then this is gonna be
an uncomfortable conversation.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.200
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Gunn.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.900
<i>All the knowledge and deductive reasoning</i>

20:18.600 --> 20:22.600
- Been a little preoccupied.
- Ah, yes. Miss Burkle.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.800
How is she?

20:24.800 --> 20:28.100
You want to get real straight
with me real fast.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.300
Of course.
Customer's always right.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.200
Everything you know...

20:33.200 --> 20:37.700
or there won't be enough of you left
to stitch back together, Frankenstein.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.400
The sarcophagus contained
the essence of an Old One...

20:40.400 --> 20:44.100
<i>a race of ancient demons</i>
<i>dead and buried for millions of years...</i>

20:44.100 --> 20:46.000

How?

20:54.200 --> 20:56.600
[ Panting ]
You can't.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.200
I don't believe that.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.700
You know a way. You have to.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.000
Get the sarcophagus
released from Customs...

21:06.000 --> 21:08.700
in exchange for making
your cerebral alterations permanent.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.100
That was the bargain
and the extent of my involvement.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.100
Then take it back.

21:13.100 --> 21:17.700
Everything you put in my head-- the law,

21:42.100 --> 21:44.700
For better or worse,
you made a deal, Mr. Gunn.

21:44.700 --> 21:48.200
I suggest you learn to live with it.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.200
Is there something you'd like
to tell me, Charles?

21:58.700 --> 22:01.000
<i>Knox was in contact with the doctor.</i>

22:01.000 --> 22:04.300
<i>- But you already know that, don't you?</i>
- Yeah, one of my sources--

22:04.300 --> 22:06.300
Don't.

22:06.300 --> 22:10.300
What he said about Fred...

22:10.300 --> 22:12.300

22:12.300 --> 22:14.100
Is it true?

22:16.400 --> 22:18.200
What did you do, Charles?

22:19.900 --> 22:22.800
It was just a piece of paper.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.700
And he could fix it, make it permanent.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.400
So I signed a piece of paper.
It was a Customs release form.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.500
I didn't think anyone would get hurt.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.100

23:03.900 --> 23:07.200
I understand it, and I can forgive it.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.000
But you knew
what was happening to her.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.900
<i>You knew who was responsible,</i>
<i>and you didn't say anything.</i>

23:25.400 --> 23:27.200
You let her die.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.100

23:31.100 --> 23:33.700
I'm less forgiving about that.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.900
- What the hell did you do?
- What I had to.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.500
I don't remember seeing ''stab Gunn''
on the agenda this morning.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.200
I avoided the major organs.
He'll probably live.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.000
- That's supposed to make it all right?
- Nothing is all right!

23:46.000 --> 23:48.400
Nothing will ever be all right.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.400
- We'll get her back, Wes.
- No, we won't.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.400
Fred's soul was--

23:55.900 --> 23:59.600
Fred's soul was destroyed
resurrecting Illyria.

24:02.300 --> 24:05.000
Are you sure?

24:08.600 --> 24:13.500
- What about Gunn?
- He let the sarcophagus in to Wolfram and Hart.

24:13.500 --> 24:17.200
What he knew, when he knew it--
It doesn't change what happened.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.700
He let her die.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.500
So did I.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.900
<i>At the well in England...</i>

24:29.900 --> 24:32.200
there was a way to save Fred...

24:33.400 --> 24:37.300
but only if thousands of others
died in her place.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.100
As much as I love Fred,
I couldn't let that happen.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.800
I need you to bury it-- everything
you're feeling, everyone you wanna hurt.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.400
I need you to put it aside and focus
on what has to be done.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.200

- We need to stop her before--
<i>- She unleashes hell on Earth?</i>

24:58.200 --> 25:00.500

25:00.500 --> 25:03.600
and a name-- Vahla ha'Nesh.

25:03.600 --> 25:07.400
Vahla ha'Nesh.
What does that mean?

25:07.700 --> 25:09.600
It's her temple.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.200
This is where she was supposed
to be resurrected.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.400
- That's Illyria.
- In its native form.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
What are these smaller bits?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.000
Her army of doom.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.400
- There's a shock.
- They were entombed with her.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.700
- Waiting for her return.
- To Los Angeles?

25:24.700 --> 25:28.500
This is where her temple was
millions of years ago, and it's still here.

You think I would've remembered seeing
something like this parked next to the Ralph's.

How could you do that
to your friends, to Fred?

27:51.300 --> 27:53.500
Because I was weak.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.600
[ Scoffs ]

27:55.600 --> 27:58.900
Because I wanted to be
somebody that I wasn't.

Let's start with you walkin' around

You think your actions will restore her.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.900
- No.
- Yet you seek a confrontation you cannot win.

Yes.
