00:10.200 --> 00:11.873
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.080 --> 00:15.039
<i>I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:19.832
<i>But instead, since Hannah came back
into my orbit, she's all I can think about.</i>

00:21.080 --> 00:23.037
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

00:23.720 --> 00:25.916
I don't know him. I'm sorry.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.276
Joey, my friend was murdered.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.917
Once I catch the killer, you won't
have to be scared anymore.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.238
If Deb were asking you to stay,
you wouldn't put up a fight.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.511
She'd want to catch
the killer as bad as I do.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.319
Sorry I'm not Deb.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.598
I think Hannah McKay is back in Miami.
Are you interested?

00:42.760 --> 00:45.150
Very.
What are you doing here?

00:45.360 --> 00:47.158
I came here for her.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.078
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

00:51.320 --> 00:53.789
I don't wanna know. I don't want
to know anything else ever.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.556
She's your problem now.
I can't go to jail, Hannah.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.154
Lose my kids again? I couldn't take it.
We've always stuck together.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.876
That's not gonna change now,
is it?

01:05.760 --> 01:09.151
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.352
Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.638
How did my blood end up there?
Your plane leaves at 8:00.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.400
Twenty-seven minutes later,
you'll land in Nassau.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.597
From there,
where you go is up to you.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.111
Where do you think you'll go?
I haven't decided.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.073
Argentina?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.271
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

01:33.560 --> 01:36.951
<i>But the changes,
they're never what we anticipate.</i>

01:37.200 --> 01:41.240
I believe Hannah McKay was just in Miami
under the alias of Maggie Castner.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.113
Stay with me.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.120
I just want to stay here with you.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.397
I know, but you can't.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.317
Dexter, I'm so sorry about Zach.
I know how much he meant to you.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.760
I need to see Dr. Vogel
and figure out our next move.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.319
You should stay here,
inside, out of view.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.274
I have to see Arlene
this afternoon after her shift.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.954
Why?
It's not safe for me to draw money

04:18.120 --> 04:20.476
out of Maggie Castner's
account anymore.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.919
The only money I have is what I've been
sending away to Arlene to hold for me.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.677
And I'm gonna need that money
to start a new life.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.192
Okay.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.557
"Be careful." I know.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.519
Actually, I was gonna say,
"I love you."

04:46.240 --> 04:48.152
I love you too.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.194
Poor child.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.074
I'm gonna have to find a way
to let the family know.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.119
Just give me a little time before
Miami Metro gets brought in.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.720
I will.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.316
This is the song that was playing
when I found Zach's body.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.593
Do you know it?
Of course.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.434
I used to play it all the time.
Still do.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.119
Does it mean anything?
It was just a pleasant song.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.556
Possibly my patients
heard me playing it.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.799
There are some signs of a struggle.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.717
They fought here.
This table is out of place.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.556
But whoever did this cleaned up
after himself. There's no blood.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.955
I wish I could understand
what this is all about.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.073
Why he's doing this.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.989
I mean, it's clearly not simply
to frighten me.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.470
He's trying to send a message.
But what is it?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.950
I don't care what his message is.
He killed Zach.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.510
He broke into my apartment
and dumped his body there.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.717
What if Harrison
had been home?

06:07.880 --> 06:11.237
I will find who did this,
and I will kill him.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.318
I'm sure you will, Dexter.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.837
But you need to remain focused.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.553
I am focused.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.232
Blood. He missed it.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.952
And a few hairs pulled out
by the roots.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.119
There's a big fingerprint
in the middle of it all.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.397
Zach's, most likely.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.157
Almost like
it was put there deliberately.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.832
Zach learned from me.

06:49.320 --> 06:53.155
He knew the importance of DNA. It's
possible that he ripped these hairs

06:53.320 --> 06:56.597
from whoever attacked him
and stuck them there for me to find.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.872
If this is a clue, as you said,

07:00.040 --> 07:04.478
then Zach acted with
extraordinary calm, rational thought.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.236
Yes.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.794
Something I'm not sure you're
doing right now, Dexter.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.749
What?
Your desire to avenge Zach's death,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.279
that's an emotional response,

07:18.080 --> 07:21.960
possibly fuelled by having
to say goodbye to Hannah.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.676
I didn't say goodbye to her.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.712
How do you mean?

07:26.920 --> 07:29.151
We're going to make a life together.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.913
Dexter, how?

07:32.520 --> 07:35.115
I don't know. We'll figure it out.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.317
Over the time I've spent with you,

07:42.520 --> 07:44.716
I've come to realise
that you're not

07:44.880 --> 07:47.600
the perfect psychopath
I thought you were.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.512
You have a depth of emotion
I never thought possible.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.634
It's true.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.710
I'll find the Brain Surgeon
and I'll kill him.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.514
But once I do, I'm gonna focus
on a life with Hannah.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.390
I think you misunderstood my point.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.276
Straddling two worlds as you are,
it's dangerous.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.678
Killers cannot have
a full emotional life.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.830
I think you underestimate me.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.678
So this is Maggie Castner's
passport photo.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.828
That's Hannah McKay's.
I won't ask how you got those.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.719
Good. Please don't.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.751
They look pretty much
the same.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.155
Have you had contact?
I have not.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.109
Her boat left for St. Kitt's yesterday,
but I don't think she was on it.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.990
What makes you think that?
Just a hunch.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.992
A lot of good that does me.
Her husband?

08:51.160 --> 08:54.119
Supposedly in New York City,
but no record of his jet landing

08:54.280 --> 08:58.911
or taking off from here. Don't know.
All right, then. I'll look into this.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.120
There's one more thing. I'd actually
like to be a part of the team on this.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.280
Heh. Thanks, but the marshal service
doesn't take on partners.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.352
I understand--
If I do find her,

09:09.520 --> 09:11.398
you'll get your reward money.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.797
Fair enough.
All right.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.760
Deb.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.520
Hey.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.438
I saw you from my car
and I had this moment

09:30.600 --> 09:32.637
where it was just like old times.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.397
Tell me you're here to see me.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.839
Quinn, actually.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.753
I meant what I said the other day.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.676
We'd love you to come back with us.
I don't think Matthews would go for it.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.038
He was pissed that I left so abruptly.
You never know, Deb.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.078
I'll leave you two be.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.991
Thanks for coming.
I need to ask you for a favour.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.198
Yeah. Anything.
I think I know who Cassie's killer is,

09:59.360 --> 10:02.797
but Matthews asked me to lay off.
The guy's from this rich family.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.192
Could you look into him for me?
Sure. This all you have?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.352
Yup. His info.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.237
Social, address,
his name's Zach Hamilton.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.597
Kid's a serial killer
in the making.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.235
I think Cassie's
the second person he killed.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.996
Yeah, I'll get right on it.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.633
I'm gonna go say hello to Dexter.

10:28.320 --> 10:32.519
<i>The sooner I can identify Zach's killer,
the sooner I can be done with all this</i>

10:32.680 --> 10:34.080
<i>and get back to Hannah.</i>

10:38.360 --> 10:41.398
You can't go in there. Sorry.
Who the fuck are you?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.193
Hey, hey, hold it.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.558
Deb, uh,
this is my daughter, Niki.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.071
Niki, this is former lieutenant
Debra Morgan.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.876
Oh, shit. Sorry.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.073
My dad says you're a total rock star.
Why'd you leave?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.031
She's a curious one.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.272
Let's go see some files over here.
Nice to meet you!

11:07.160 --> 11:09.755
What the fuck are you doing
with Zach Hamilton?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.640
Quinn called.
He thinks Zach killed Cassie.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.319
I thought so too,
but I checked it out.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.394
Zach didn't.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.720
What was Zach doing
with you and Hannah in the Keys?

11:25.920 --> 11:28.389
Serial killers convention?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.551
I was helping Dr. Vogel out.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.760
I don't know why I even
ask you these questions.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.072
No one else knows.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.992
Zach's dead.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.632
Now I know.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.637
I don't want to know, because now
I have to explain how I know.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.593
Kind of, yes.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.275
I was thinking
about coming back here.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.309
About being a detective again,
doing something good for a change.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.480
But...

12:12.040 --> 12:15.272
It'll just lead me into another
fucked up situation, won't it?

12:33.040 --> 12:35.157
<i>A familial match...</i>

12:36.720 --> 12:39.076
<i>to Dr. Evelyn Vogel?</i>

12:42.360 --> 12:45.717
What?
The hairs we found in Zach's studio.

12:45.880 --> 12:49.271
I ran a mitochondrial DNA match on
them. It tests a person's mother line.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.116
Yeah, I'm aware of those tests.
Well, it's a direct match to you.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.558
Zach's killer is related to you.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.832
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.916
How is that possible?
I have no family.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.440
Well, not anymore.
Anymore.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.195
Well, I was married
and I had two sons.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.031
Daniel and Richard.
And now?

13:13.600 --> 13:16.479
They're gone.
What happened to them?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.998
One day, I found Richard,
he was my youngest,

13:23.320 --> 13:25.755
at the bottom
of our swimming pool, dead.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.952
At first I thought it was
an accident.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.879
He wasn't a strong swimmer.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.271
But then I realised the truth.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.359
My older son, Daniel...

13:36.720 --> 13:38.154
he...

13:39.480 --> 13:42.518
He killed Richard.
Yes.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.353
Daniel was--
Daniel was highly intelligent.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.119
But he was also very troubled.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.875
No, it was much more than that.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.110
He was devoid of empathy,

13:57.680 --> 14:01.390
had a complete lack of fear
or the sense of right and wrong.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.992
He was a psychopath.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.153
Realising this and wanting to...

14:10.040 --> 14:12.600
find a way to help Daniel
led me into this field.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.590
I failed Daniel. I...

14:25.040 --> 14:27.635
I was never able to treat him.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.833
Maybe that's one reason
I was so determined to help you.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.513
This is Daniel.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.997
My husband and I covered up
his involvement in Richard's death.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.550
Said it was an accident

14:42.240 --> 14:45.551
and then we put Daniel
into a mental health institute.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.439
He was only 14.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.913
Here in Miami?
No.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.992
No, I sent him back to England.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.117
Three years later, he was dead.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.880
How?

14:59.160 --> 15:02.597
A fire broke out in the wing
where Daniel was living.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.515
Some idiot nurse had left the door
locked to take a coffee break.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.713
The children couldn't get out.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.280
Seven of them perished.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.631
One of them was Daniel.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.959
Did you see the body?

15:15.440 --> 15:18.080
No. My husband did.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.672
He was horribly burned.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.598
If it was his body.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.350
That's preposterous, Dexter.
He can't be alive.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.236
You said yourself he's highly intelligent.
Could've faked his death.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.312
But after all these years,

15:34.520 --> 15:37.319
why would he do
these terrible things now?

15:37.960 --> 15:39.792
The brain cores.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.320
Do they mean anything to you?

15:44.240 --> 15:45.879
Well...

15:46.520 --> 15:49.240
Well, even as a child, Daniel was

15:50.040 --> 15:53.875
aware that he lacked empathy

15:54.640 --> 15:57.155
and how I felt about it.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.198
It's possible he boxed some up...

16:02.640 --> 16:04.393
and left it at my door.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.120
<i>Daniel Vogel would be in his mid-40s.</i>

16:31.480 --> 16:34.154
Anybody. Nobody.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.560
<i>That guy Cassie was dating.
He was interviewed that night.</i>

16:57.680 --> 16:59.239
<i>Oliver Saxon.</i>

17:10.079 --> 17:12.914
<i>Is it possible this is Vogel's son?</i>

17:22.960 --> 17:26.476
<i>Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.</i>

17:26.680 --> 17:30.037
You created half a dozen fake IDs.
He could've done the same.

17:30.240 --> 17:35.031
The easiest way is to assume
the identity of a dead person.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.240
Oliver Saxon,
death certificate.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.831
The guy's a fake. Doesn't mean
he's your brain surgeon.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.834
I need to get a DNA sample
from him.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.639
Dexter, this is
Deputy Marshal Clayton.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.277
He's here on a tip that
Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.516
Uh, sorry if I don't seem glad to
meet you, this is kind of a shock.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.598
I guess you haven't talked to her.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.952
Why would I?
I told him that you dated Hannah

18:07.160 --> 18:10.073
before you turned her in
for the Sal Price murders.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.000
Wasn't the smoothest breakup.
I guess not.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.674
And that makes you a target.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.239
Frankly, the Hannah McKay I knew

18:19.840 --> 18:22.400
would be too smart to risk
coming back to Miami.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.156
Could be. Look, I got no
definite information she's here.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.597
I'm just following up on a tip.
But until we know for sure,

18:29.760 --> 18:32.434
we should put unis
on you till this plays out.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.593
<i>That's the last thing I need
trying to help Hannah hide.</i>

18:35.800 --> 18:39.953
<i>On the other hand, the Brain Surgeon's
still out there. He knows where I live.</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:41.918
I don't need unis to watch me,

18:42.080 --> 18:44.800
just my apartment
and my son when he goes to school.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.316
Don't worry,
we'll watch Harrison like a hawk.

18:47.520 --> 18:52.390
Deputy Marshal Clayton, how do you plan
to find Hannah even if she is here?

18:52.600 --> 18:56.071
Getting her picture out with local media,
asking anyone to call if they spot her.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.680
Okay.

18:57.840 --> 19:02.073
But if by some chance she decides
you two need to talk things over,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.792
be sure and give me a call,
won't you?

19:04.960 --> 19:07.794
Of course. I want her behind bars
as much as you do.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.793
Okay.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.355
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.591
Trying to straddle both worlds.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.713
You should be following up
on Saxon right now.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.039
Let Hannah handle her own problems.
I can do both.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.077
Hey.
<i>Have you gone to see Arlene yet?</i>

19:36.240 --> 19:37.833
No, I was just about to leave.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.600
Don't. I just had
a federal marshal in my office.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.918
<i>They know you're here.</i>
Oh, God.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.311
You can't go to Arlene's. Lay low.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.796
I can't start a new life
without that money.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.674
<i>I can give you money.</i>
Half a million dollars?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.280
Well, no.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.435
I'll drive you.
I'm not letting you go by yourself.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.074
Okay, but hurry.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.716
This marshal changes everything.
We can never be together here.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.479
I know.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.194
What are we gonna do?

20:20.440 --> 20:22.397
Let's get your money,
figure it out later.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.514
You were right, the hotel manager
in Key West positively ID'd Zach.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.071
He was down there when she was killed.
Where do you get your information?

20:35.760 --> 20:37.911
I have my sources.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.597
Wish I had your sources.
Thought I had this one nailed.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.671
Well, you're at square one. You've
been there before. You'll close it.

20:45.840 --> 20:49.356
Just after the whole
sergeant dick dance, you know,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.029
I got something to prove.
You're a good cop.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.913
You don't have to prove anything.

20:55.080 --> 20:59.199
Then there's Jamie, you know,
I'd kind of like to solve it for her.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.839
She was really close to Cassie.
Yeah.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.271
I just haven't
been there for her lately.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.759
I thought she moved in.
I mean, like, emotionally.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.038
Heh. Since when are you Mr. Sensitive?
Fuck you.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.113
It pours right out of you.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.029
You know, she's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.517
Oh. Um...

21:27.360 --> 21:30.080
Well, I mean, I can't really
advise you on that.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.757
Puts me in an awkward position.
Why?

21:32.960 --> 21:37.000
Because of our history, asshole.
I mean, history is history, right?

21:40.160 --> 21:42.675
Jamie knew Cassie
better than anyone.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.669
Question her again . Maybe
something'll turn up.

21:45.840 --> 21:50.551
She's been a wreck, it's hard walking
the line between boyfriend and cop.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.234
I'll talk to her.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.274
Really?
Yeah. Be fun to play cop again.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.073
That'd be great. Thanks.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.671
You can buy me lunch.
And two fucking desserts.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.510
Nice place.
Found that when you're a fugitive,

22:15.680 --> 22:19.230
asking somebody to hold half
a million dollars, incentives help.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.840
So Arlene gets a cut?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.680
She gets what she needs to keep
the kids off welfare, I get--

22:23.880 --> 22:25.997
The bank of Arlene.
Exactly.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.352
Hey, babe.
Hey, Arlene.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.750
Huh.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.078
You're the asshole who turned her in.
That would be me.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.640
Long story.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.193
Can we come in?
Yeah.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.189
So now we're
back together, huh?

22:44.400 --> 22:46.153
How's that gonna work out?

22:47.240 --> 22:48.754
We're figuring it out.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.756
I told the kids there's snakes in
here so they wouldn't go near it.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.554
There you go.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.473
Ah, shit.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.919
Who's that?
Federal marshal.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.717
Stay here. I'll handle this.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.792
You answer the door.
Come with me.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.998
Like you've got nothing
to hide.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.158
Can I help you?
I'm Deputy Marshal Clayton.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.397
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.674
- Uh, Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.073
Dexter Morgan.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.719
What are you doing here?

23:39.480 --> 23:42.951
Arlene's a friend.
We met through Hannah.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.712
Really now?
Yeah, I stopped by

23:45.920 --> 23:48.640
to tell her what you said,
Hannah might be in Miami.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.714
Yeah, I gotta keep
an extra eye on the kids.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.236
Looks like you recently
changed your address.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.313
Seems like a step up.
Better school district.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.593
Says here you work part-time
waiting tables at Denny's.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.400
That's right.
That won't buy you a doll's house,

24:05.560 --> 24:07.791
let alone pay rent on this.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.350
You sure you haven't gotten
help from Hannah McKay,

24:10.520 --> 24:14.070
who just happened to have married a man
worth over half a billion dollars?

24:14.240 --> 24:17.631
Didn't even know she was married.
Says here you got a record.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.996
Do you have any idea
how many years

24:20.200 --> 24:23.876
aiding and abetting a fugitive buys?
I'm the one who's been...

24:26.760 --> 24:28.592
helping out Arlene.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.472
Heh. Now I see what you two
really bonded over.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.634
You sure can pick them.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.394
Listen, do me a favour.

24:40.560 --> 24:43.394
Either of you hear from
your old friend, Hannah McKay,

24:43.560 --> 24:45.358
you give me a call.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.000
Of course.
Yeah, we will.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.599
Hey, Deb. Dexter's not here.
I know, I was driving by.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.752
Wanted to say hello
to the little man.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.351
Oh.
Look, Aunt Deb, I can write my name.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.920
That's awesome.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.712
I am so sorry about Cassie.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.120
You doing okay working here
and everything?

25:23.800 --> 25:26.554
Honestly, no. Not really.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.430
The cops are watching
the place, which helps.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.239
She have a lot of friends?

25:31.640 --> 25:34.030
Yeah. She's pretty popular.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.029
Everyone's just in shock,
you know? Especially Oliver.

25:39.400 --> 25:42.359
Who's that?
This guy Cassie was dating.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.158
Were they dating for a long time?

25:46.320 --> 25:48.391
Just a couple weeks.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.479
I guess it was love at first sight.
At least for him.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.430
What do you mean "for him"?
Between us,

25:54.600 --> 25:57.195
I think Cassie was gonna
break it off with Oliver.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.194
Then he was all,
"Let's go to the Bahamas for a week."

26:00.360 --> 26:03.637
After two weeks of dating?
He kept pushing her into it.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.589
He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
You weren't a fan, I take it.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.797
I thought he could be
a little clingy.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.437
But he was great to Cassie.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.157
Hey, we should all have someone
who worships us like that, right?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.514
Hm.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.916
When was the trip
supposed to happen?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.440
This week, I think.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.200
Hey.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.474
Quinn, it's me. I just talked to Jamie.
We need to revisit the boyfriend.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.438
Oliver Saxon.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.309
So you think Clayton
bought your little story?

26:45.480 --> 26:46.880
I'm not sure.

26:47.080 --> 26:51.313
Either way, he's got your photo all over Miami.
It's not safe to go to the hotel.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.279
You need something private.
Yeah, but where?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.917
I do know of one place.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.796
Something tells me it's
the last place I'll want to go.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.037
Debra's, if I can talk her into it.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.274
I was right.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.069
I can't think of a better option,
can you?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.636
Unfortunately, I can't.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.394
Answering more questions?
Anything I can do to help find

27:22.560 --> 27:25.075
who did this to Cassie.
This must be hard on you.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.755
The last few days
have been a nightmare.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.991
I still can't even believe it.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.799
I just wish I had time to breathe,
I'm so busy at work.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.993
I'm already late for an appointment.
Won't take long.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.039
What is it you do, exactly?
Building inspections.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.760
Where you were when Cassie died?
Yes.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.038
You're welcome to look at my
workbook, I was in Sunny Isles

27:46.200 --> 27:49.193
inspecting a new condo.
- Just a few minutes from here.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.239
Yes.
You must be pretty busy, huh?

27:52.440 --> 27:55.000
I'm booked wall-to-wall
for the next few weeks.

27:55.160 --> 27:59.598
Oh, really? I thought you and Cassie
were planning a trip to the Bahamas.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.273
How were you gonna
work that in?

28:03.800 --> 28:07.111
I guess that was a little crazy.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.759
Cassie kept pushing,
I didn't want to disappoint her.

28:10.920 --> 28:14.357
Oh, it was her idea?
Yeah. She wanted a romantic getaway.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.432
Seems a little fast, don't you think?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.671
After a few weeks of dating.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.034
I know it's hard
for most people to understand,

28:22.200 --> 28:25.193
but we had something special.
And we both knew it.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.633
Look, I'm really sorry, you guys.
I've got to get going.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.190
Maybe we can pick this up later?
Yeah, no.

28:35.400 --> 28:39.155
We'll come back another time.
That would be great. Thanks.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.075
He lied to us.
About what?

28:50.280 --> 28:52.795
Jamie said that whole
Bahamas thing was his idea.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.071
A way for Cassie
not to dump him.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.391
That doesn't mean he's a killer,
you know.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.916
He just could be
fucking obsessed with her.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.833
It wouldn't hurt to look
into it.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.993
Look a little deeper into his alibi.
I'll get on that.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.160
Feel that?

29:08.800 --> 29:10.917
What?
Us, you know,

29:11.080 --> 29:14.118
working together again.
It's nice, you know?

29:15.680 --> 29:19.230
Yeah, it's a lot better than
doing background checks for Elway.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.274
Yeah.
I forgot how much I like it.

29:29.840 --> 29:33.151
Shit. Uh... I'm sorry.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.352
I don't know why I did that.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.191
Let's just pretend you didn't.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.270
Okay.
Okay.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.199
What the fuck?
Sorry, we let ourselves in.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.512
You two should talk alone.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.875
I need a place
where Hannah can stay.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.470
And you want that to be my place?

30:26.520 --> 30:29.433
There's a federal marshal
after her.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.792
He knows she's in Miami.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.839
He's gonna do everything
he can to find her.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.957
It's the only move I could think of.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.120
To bring Hannah to my house?
I know.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.234
It's only for a couple of nights.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.876
Just until I can get her out of Miami.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.354
Please?

30:56.920 --> 30:59.037
A couple of nights, that's it.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.514
Thank you.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.798
You could also thank me
for getting Quinn off Zach's trail.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.234
How?

31:08.880 --> 31:11.634
Simple. Get him
to focus on the boyfriend.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.711
Oliver Saxon.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.754
Saxon? You think he did it?
Well, he's a damn good suspect.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.559
Quinn and I talked to him today.

31:22.720 --> 31:26.396
<i>If Saxon thinks the police are onto him,
he'll know that I'm onto him.</i>

31:26.560 --> 31:28.472
You should stay away
from Saxon, Deb.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.916
He could be more dangerous
than you think.

31:31.960 --> 31:35.317
What are you talking about?
I can't go into it right now,

31:35.480 --> 31:39.110
but please, just do as I ask.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.030
I knew going back to the force would
put me in a fucked up situation.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.880
Here it is, ahead of schedule.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.953
He's all yours.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.718
You'll be okay here?

32:19.280 --> 32:20.919
Sure.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.558
We'll just hang.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.034
Heh.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.679
<i>If Deb and Quinn did anything
to spook Saxon, I have to act fast.</i>

32:42.040 --> 32:45.317
<i>I'm too late.
He's already moved out.</i>

33:04.720 --> 33:06.951
<i>But if this has his DNA</i>

33:07.280 --> 33:10.591
<i>I can check it against the hairs
I found at Zach's studio.</i>

33:12.640 --> 33:14.074
Here you go.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.910
Are we going to see Hannah?

33:19.720 --> 33:22.076
Hannah? Why?
I saw her on TV.

33:22.240 --> 33:25.312
They said people are looking
for her. Is she in trouble?

33:26.600 --> 33:30.560
No, she's fine.
Hannah's just popular.

33:32.840 --> 33:37.676
You miss her?
Yeah. I liked playing with her.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.593
She was nice.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.717
I wish she could be my mom.

34:10.520 --> 34:14.150
<i>It's a match. Saxon is Vogel's son.</i>

34:22.719 --> 34:26.190
Daniel.
He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.630
He dated my neighbour
until he killed her

34:28.800 --> 34:31.156
in her apartment
two doors down from mine.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.039
Do you have any idea where he is?

34:33.199 --> 34:35.157
No, he cleared out
of his place.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.070
He could be anywhere
right now.

34:38.239 --> 34:40.516
Suppose you do find him,
Dexter.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.110
What are you going to do?
What do you think?

34:44.239 --> 34:46.516
I don't know how I feel about that.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.672
He's murdered
four innocent people

34:48.840 --> 34:50.831
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.793
He's my son.
There's nothing you can do for him.

34:57.120 --> 35:01.000
I can try putting him
back into a safe facility

35:01.200 --> 35:03.396
where he can't hurt himself
or anyone else.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.234
I'm not going to let you kill him.
I'm sorry.

35:06.440 --> 35:10.116
You brought me into this.
I didn't know who he was then.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.159
Try and understand,
my youngest son is gone forever.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.759
Maybe I have a second chance
with Daniel.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.677
You really believe that?
You have a son.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.718
Wouldn't you believe it?

35:24.600 --> 35:27.399
<i>This second chance she wants
could get us both killed.</i>

35:27.600 --> 35:30.718
<i>For her own sake, I have to tell her
what she wants to hear.</i>

35:30.880 --> 35:33.156
Fine, we'll do it your way. Just...

35:34.240 --> 35:37.312
Help me find him.
Is there a way to reach out to him?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.639
I don't know.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.034
Think.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.918
The Mama Cass song that he left
playing in your apartment...

35:47.160 --> 35:48.879
What about it?
One of the few

35:49.080 --> 35:52.596
happy memories I have with Daniel
as a boy was, every Saturday,

35:52.760 --> 35:55.559
I'd take him to
the King's Bay Cafe in the marina.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.151
There was a juke box there.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.039
And Daniel would
always play that song.

36:02.920 --> 36:06.960
Maybe it's more than a happy memory.
Maybe it's an invitation.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.036
King's Bay Cafe. It's still there.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.594
Saxon's been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.958
We know he stole
your computer files.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.794
But how could he have known about
Zach Hamilton? We met him after that.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.751
The detailed notes
you keep on your computer...

36:28.920 --> 36:30.354
Yes?

36:30.520 --> 36:33.638
I think Saxon's
been monitoring your laptop.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.274
It wouldn't be hard.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.713
You just need the right spyware.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.436
We can use this. Write an entry
in your journal saying you're going

36:41.600 --> 36:45.560
to King's Bay Cafe tomorrow morning.
You think he'll read it and go?

36:45.760 --> 36:48.753
You said yourself he's been
trying to send you a message.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.877
He wants to see you.

37:06.600 --> 37:11.277
<i>I don't like deceiving Vogel,
but if it's the only way to get to Saxon...</i>

37:14.560 --> 37:17.792
You had no choice, Dex.
You had to lie to her.

37:18.680 --> 37:22.435
I just can't believe Vogel
still thinks her son can be helped.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.115
Well, it's not that crazy.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.872
After everything he's done.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.990
You would want to help
Harrison, wouldn't you?

37:32.560 --> 37:34.756
Vogel pretty much
made the same point.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.755
She's right. I mean, look at what
your own father did to protect you.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.280
Right or not,
Saxon needs to be stopped.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.477
I'm putting him on my table.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.750
And how is Vogel
going to feel about that?

37:54.560 --> 37:58.190
I can't worry about it now.
At least she'll be alive.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.316
Well, you'll figure it out.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.317
I'm glad you're here.

38:12.440 --> 38:16.514
I wanna be able to keep
being here for you, Dex.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.199
But?

38:23.080 --> 38:26.630
But there's no life for me here
in Florida, we both know it.

38:31.200 --> 38:34.477
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.072
In Argentina.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.671
Maybe we all can.

38:42.240 --> 38:46.075
You and Harrison could meet me there.
We can start over.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.120
It would be hard on Harrison,
uproot his whole life.

38:52.280 --> 38:55.398
At first, it might be, but
sometimes change is a good thing.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.831
Sometimes it can--
Yes.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.798
Me, you, and Harrison.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.676
We're gonna move to Argentina.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.718
We'll make it work, Dex.

39:11.880 --> 39:15.271
I can give my notice at Miami
Metro, say I'm burnt out.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.079
I'm taking Harrison
to travel for a while.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.239
Only Debra will know the truth.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.954
Lieutenant.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.551
Have you heard anything on the
whereabouts of Zach Hamilton?

39:40.760 --> 39:44.800
Zach Hamilton? You made it pretty
clear that we back away from him.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.880
I just got a call from his parents.
They haven't heard from him in days.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.632
Did they file
a missing persons report?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.439
They just did.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.471
Look, in case he does turn up,

39:58.160 --> 40:01.153
I wanna be the first to know.
I'll make sure of it.

40:07.800 --> 40:11.555
Deb, thanks for coming in.
Yeah. What's up?

40:19.040 --> 40:21.600
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.677
You'll earn your way back up.

40:30.840 --> 40:35.312
You don't know how happy this makes me.
Like the family coming together again.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.558
We gotta celebrate.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.920
Yeah.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.560
What?

40:46.240 --> 40:48.709
It's all happening so fast.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.318
And? Would you rather
it happened slow?

40:52.480 --> 40:56.793
I just need some time
to think about it.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.794
What's to think about?
Thought this is what you wanted?

40:59.960 --> 41:01.360
It is.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.757
I mean, I thought it was.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.914
I don't get it.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.239
I just need a little time, you know?

41:14.520 --> 41:16.239
Take all the time you need.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.080
Hey.

41:25.640 --> 41:27.233
Hold on to this.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.556
Hey.
Heh.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.913
I, uh, tried getting in touch
with Saxon,

41:55.080 --> 41:57.356
but he's not answering his phone.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.838
Went by his place. He cleared out.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.790
Shit.
Yeah.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.398
At least we're on the right track.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.358
Yeah.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.193
Good luck with that.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.999
Deb.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.078
I, uh, wouldn't have
gotten this far without you.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.511
I'm glad I could help.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.317
You cleaned.
A little.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.314
Well, I hope I can still find shit.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.878
I used to know where everything was.

42:51.520 --> 42:54.274
Hungry?
Are you kidding?

42:56.160 --> 42:57.799
Totally fair.

42:58.480 --> 43:02.190
Well, I am gonna eat,
and I made enough for you too.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.960
You going back?

43:10.960 --> 43:12.952
How the fuck can I go back?

43:15.120 --> 43:16.998
My brother's a serial killer.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.796
And I have another one
hiding out in my house, eating salad.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.993
Sorry.

43:29.720 --> 43:32.155
It was stupid to think
that I could go back.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.350
Well, I know a lot about
wanting things that you can't have.

43:44.520 --> 43:47.752
I wish somewhere I'd learned
to take "no" for an answer.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.118
Would have made my life
a lot easier.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.953
But you didn't.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.998
I'll take that one.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.433
Right.

43:59.440 --> 44:02.274
Well, it's just who I am.
And, uh...

44:02.440 --> 44:04.909
Something tells me
you might be the same way.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.037
Maybe that's the one thing
we have in common.

44:24.720 --> 44:27.076
Heh. I can't believe
I'm eating food you made.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.312
It's not bad, though, right?

44:30.040 --> 44:31.474
No.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.391
All right, two-minute warning, Harrison.
Swim lessons are calling.

44:43.560 --> 44:44.960
Almost done.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.674
Sorry about this
police-protection business.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.710
No, it's good.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.718
I'm actually glad
that they're here.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.709
If Hannah were to stop by, poor Harrison
would probably run right to her.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.434
<i>He's not the only one.</i>

45:04.200 --> 45:06.476
Dexter,
hope I'm not intruding.

45:06.680 --> 45:10.071
No, not at all. Come in.
All right.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.120
What can I do for you?

45:13.280 --> 45:15.670
Checking in, making
sure everything's okay.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.515
Yeah, everything's fine.
Well, good to hear.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.596
I'm thinking the Hannah McKay threat
has pretty much died down.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.837
Oh, yeah?
I mean, if she was here

45:25.000 --> 45:28.960
I'm sure she's gone. I'll recommend
we pull off your protective detail.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.316
Okay.
All right.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.599
And what's your name?

45:36.760 --> 45:38.991
Harrison.
Harrison.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.030
Huh. Is this your family?
Mm-hm.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.473
Is this your daddy?

45:47.680 --> 45:49.273
That's you, right?
Mm-hm.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.551
Now, who's the pretty lady?

45:57.120 --> 46:00.352
That's my mom.
Your mom?

46:00.520 --> 46:04.673
Hey, why don't you go grab
your towel, bud. Swim time.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.957
Come on, let's go,
little shark man.

46:12.080 --> 46:16.199
He lost his mother when he was a baby,
drawing her helps him feel closer to her.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.272
Sure.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.558
Well, we really do need
to get going.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.798
Thanks for checking in.
All right, take care.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.759
Hey, you got a sec?
Sure.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.675
Closing the door.
That's never a good sign.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.159
Hannah McKay dated your brother?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.435
You didn't think to mention
that to me at all?

46:49.600 --> 46:52.399
Never crossed your mind?
I didn't think it was important.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.959
What else are you not telling me?

46:55.160 --> 46:59.040
I don't know, but if I told you--
Drop the bullshit, Morgan.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.759
What happened in the Keys?

47:00.960 --> 47:02.440
You see her?

47:03.240 --> 47:04.913
No.

47:05.680 --> 47:09.196
I don't believe you. You either saw her
or your brother told you to lay off.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.033
What if he did?
What does it matter?

47:11.200 --> 47:14.716
I'll give you 250,000 reasons why. But
clearly we have different priorities.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.679
My brother? We do.
After all I've done for you,

47:17.840 --> 47:20.116
I find it hard to believe
you could do this.

47:20.640 --> 47:24.190
And maybe you need to ask yourself
if this is the right job for you.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.996
And if not, why don't you
get the fuck out.

47:27.160 --> 47:30.710
Because I could use the office space
for somebody that gives a shit.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.474
Oh, Dexter.

47:41.040 --> 47:43.350
Sorry, I know I'm early.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.437
I'd make you coffee,
but I only have tea.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.193
That'll do.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.995
I warn you,
it's strong.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.677
I need all the help
I can get this morning.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.559
Thanks.

48:06.080 --> 48:09.312
Just so we're clear,
I'm meeting up with Daniel

48:09.480 --> 48:13.235
and I'll lead him out of the cafe,
where you will sedate him.

48:13.400 --> 48:16.552
And then we'll take him to a facility.

48:29.400 --> 48:33.713
Every time I close my eyes,
I still see his face.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.593
Daniel.
Yes.

48:36.760 --> 48:40.754
Now to learn that he's alive
is so difficult to accept.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.199
It is hard to believe.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.871
But another part of me
knows it's true.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.438
And I'm going to see him.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.314
My son.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.713
My little boy.

49:00.760 --> 49:02.877
He still exists.

49:03.200 --> 49:06.591
No matter what he's done. Unh.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.550
<i>I thought one of Hannah's potions
would be gentler than my needle.</i>

49:14.120 --> 49:17.750
<i>Now Vogel will never
have to face what her son has become.</i>

49:34.280 --> 49:37.637
Can I get a cup of coffee please?
I'll bring that right over.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.520
Here you go.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.120
- Hey, Lucy.
- Hi.

50:30.600 --> 50:34.480
<i>He's played that song three times.
When is he gonna give up?</i>

50:52.240 --> 50:55.756
<i>I'll follow him until I find
a quiet place to grab him.</i>

50:56.280 --> 50:59.751
<i>For Vogel's own good,
it's time I kill the messenger.</i>

52:02.120 --> 52:05.033
Saxon must have spotted you.
He's good at this.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.232
He might think Vogel
sent you, Dexter.

52:08.640 --> 52:10.916
He could be going
to her house right now.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.079
<i>You've reached Dr. Evelyn Vogel.</i>

52:16.240 --> 52:19.278
<i>I'm not available at this time.
Please leave a message.</i>

52:19.960 --> 52:21.394
Evelyn!

52:31.440 --> 52:34.194
You drugged me.
You have every right to be upset,

52:34.360 --> 52:37.080
but I was trying to protect you.
Where's Daniel?

52:38.480 --> 52:40.790
He got away. That's why
I'm here, to warn you.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.878
Well, I consider myself warned.

52:43.040 --> 52:46.511
And I think it best from here on out
that I handle this myself.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.837
It's not safe. Or smart.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.719
I appreciate your concern

52:50.920 --> 52:54.994
and I'm grateful for everything
you've done. But this is a family matter.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.833
You once called yourself
my spiritual mother.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.878
Doesn't that make us family?

53:03.760 --> 53:06.400
Well, after what happened
this morning, Dexter,

53:07.000 --> 53:08.639
how can I trust you?

53:13.040 --> 53:16.431
Well, trust me or not,
I'm going to take care of Daniel.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.717
Your safety and mine depend on it.

53:18.920 --> 53:21.913
And after that,
I'm on my way with Hannah.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.237
On your way?
Leaving Miami with her.

53:24.400 --> 53:27.518
We're going away with Harrison.
That won't end well.

53:27.720 --> 53:31.077
And you trusting Daniel,
that he's not gonna hurt anyone again?

53:31.800 --> 53:33.519
How will that end?

53:35.120 --> 53:37.157
Leave this alone, Dexter.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.358
<i>Vogel thinks I'm unique,
caught between two worlds,</i>

53:53.520 --> 53:56.035
<i>my humanity and my darkness.</i>

53:56.440 --> 53:58.636
<i>Maybe I always will be,
but I can't imagine</i>

53:58.800 --> 54:01.076
<i>a life without Hannah in either one.</i>

54:01.720 --> 54:03.791
<i>After this morning, I won't have to.</i>

54:03.960 --> 54:06.429
<i>Vogel is on her own, and so am I.</i>

54:07.360 --> 54:11.479
<i>I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.</i>

54:14.040 --> 54:15.997
So now do you believe me?

54:16.560 --> 54:18.153
Yes.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.879
You didn't send him.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.879
Are you hungry?

54:24.520 --> 54:26.352
How about
a little breakfast?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.753
Okay...

54:37.080 --> 54:38.833
Mom.
