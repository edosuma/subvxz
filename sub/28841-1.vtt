06:06.791 --> 06:07.590
Come on, Martha.

06:07.592 --> 06:08.658
Last call for bathroom.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.494
Let's go.

06:12.130 --> 06:13.465
Don't touch me!

11:03.488 --> 11:06.656
Hi, I wasn't sure I'd
catch you before you leave.

11:06.658 --> 11:07.857
What are you doing here?

11:07.859 --> 11:09.091
Isn't today your day off?
Yes.

11:09.093 --> 11:10.560
I was on my way to church

11:10.562 --> 11:12.428
but I couldn't
resist stopping in

11:12.430 --> 11:15.331
to see if you have the
ultrasound and pictures of baby.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.532
You got 'em I hope?

11:16.534 --> 11:18.436
- Mindy has 'em.
- All right, thanks.

11:20.772 --> 11:22.071
Hi.

11:22.073 --> 11:23.573
This is a surprise.

11:23.575 --> 11:26.409
I just had to drop by to
see pictures of my baby.

11:26.411 --> 11:27.877
Your baby?

11:27.879 --> 11:30.012
Well I'm the one's gonna
be taking care of her.

11:30.014 --> 11:31.547
And you couldn't
wait until Monday?

11:31.549 --> 11:34.786
- Um, no, I couldn't.
- All right.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.821
Okay, so that is the
head and that's the body.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.122
Gosh, you know what?

11:40.124 --> 11:42.192
Sort of looks like
a girl, doesn't it?

11:42.194 --> 11:43.726
You know, that's exactly
what Cord's dad said

11:43.728 --> 11:45.295
when I showed it to him.

11:45.297 --> 11:46.130
Wow.

11:47.399 --> 11:48.998
When you're packing
make sure you take

11:49.000 --> 11:50.633
a lot of extra warm clothes.

11:50.635 --> 11:53.269
I heard it's gonna rain
in the mountains tonight.

11:53.271 --> 11:56.772
Can't have anything happening
to our baby, can we?

11:56.774 --> 11:58.241
You know, I was beginning
to think that you were

11:58.243 --> 11:59.875
worried about me.

11:59.877 --> 12:02.113
- Oh, yeah a little.
- All right.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.447
Do you think you could take
this out to my siblings?

12:04.449 --> 12:05.717
- Sure.
- Thank you.

12:11.956 --> 12:15.758
Hey, Cord, I've got Mindy's
bags by the door for you here.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.227
- Awesome, thank you.
- Sure, no problem.

12:17.229 --> 12:19.495
Remaining few institutions
for the criminally

12:19.497 --> 12:22.432
insane in Colorado
where three employees

12:22.434 --> 12:24.800
have been brutally murdered.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.836
The victims have
not been identified

12:26.838 --> 12:28.504
pending notifications
to their family.

12:28.506 --> 12:30.139
Hey, you guys
be careful, okay?

12:30.141 --> 12:32.442
- Okay, we will.
- All right.

12:32.444 --> 12:33.576
Be careful,
drive carefully.

12:33.578 --> 12:34.610
Will do.

12:34.612 --> 12:35.845
You have everything?
Yes.

12:35.847 --> 12:36.712
Awesome.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.448
- Bye, Stella.
- Bye.

12:38.450 --> 12:40.149
With me is Sheriff Brand.

12:40.151 --> 12:42.652
Sheriff, do you have any
leads on last night's

12:42.654 --> 12:43.586
triple murder?

12:43.588 --> 12:45.288
It's been almost 12 hours.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.756
Yeah, we have several leads.

12:46.758 --> 12:48.824
We believe we'll apprehend
the suspect currently.

12:48.826 --> 12:50.993
We were informed that
the dogs lost her trail

12:50.995 --> 12:52.428
one block from the asylum.

12:52.430 --> 12:53.963
Could this mean that the suspect

12:53.965 --> 12:56.566
has somebody on the
outside assisting her?

12:56.568 --> 12:57.567
Not necessarily.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.768
She could've stolen the vehicle

12:58.770 --> 13:00.636
or kidnapped somebody
in the process.

13:00.638 --> 13:02.338
Any advice for the public?

13:02.340 --> 13:03.273
Yeah.

13:03.275 --> 13:04.874
Stay inside, lock your doors.

13:04.876 --> 13:06.942
She's considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

13:06.944 --> 13:08.811
Do not attempt to contact
her and call the sheriff

13:08.813 --> 13:10.012
if you see her.

13:10.014 --> 13:11.281
And there you have it.

13:11.283 --> 13:12.548
This is Veronica Desky
reporting to you live

13:12.550 --> 13:14.584
from the Providence Asylum.

15:27.118 --> 15:27.952
Hey, Gord.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.753
Mindy.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.354
Y'all back for another weekend?

15:32.356 --> 15:33.623
Not sure how many
more there'll be.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.827
We've actually decided
to sell the property.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.830
You must've talked about
that for a long time.

15:40.832 --> 15:43.000
This place meant
everything to your dad.

15:44.135 --> 15:45.367
I know.

15:45.369 --> 15:47.603
It was just too much
of a hassle to upkeep.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.371
How long did you
guys talk about that?

15:49.373 --> 15:51.108
I bet that was a tough decision.

15:52.176 --> 15:53.943
That place meant
everything to your dad.

15:53.945 --> 15:57.046
He effectively built it
with his own two hands.

15:57.048 --> 16:00.251
I remember when he took
you hunting with us.

16:01.385 --> 16:03.586
You started at
what, about seven?

16:03.588 --> 16:05.588
Yeah, something like that.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.590
You know, I got
a buck last week.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.460
I was starting to dig
into it and cook it.

16:10.462 --> 16:13.295
If I can I'll bring
you guys a leg later.

16:13.297 --> 16:14.530
No problem.

16:14.532 --> 16:15.330
We can actually pick
it up on the way back

16:15.332 --> 16:16.167
into town tomorrow.

16:17.334 --> 16:19.201
Maybe I'll swing
by you and I'll have

16:19.203 --> 16:21.003
a drink or two with you two

16:21.005 --> 16:23.741
just 'cause you got that
really good scotch that I like.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.810
You're
always welcome.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.111
We gotta do some
repairs before we invite

16:29.113 --> 16:31.346
buyers to take a look.
Yeah, I understand.

16:31.348 --> 16:33.148
You always have
to do that, Cord.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.417
But you guys do
what you have to do

16:35.419 --> 16:37.722
and I hope you get
a good price for it.

16:38.990 --> 16:40.324
See you, Joel.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.206
I'm Johnny Black.

17:30.608 --> 17:31.709
Lonely Heart.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.752
I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:29.593 --> 19:31.495
I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:33.530 --> 19:35.230
My car went off the road.

19:35.232 --> 19:36.531
I was wondering
if I could just...

19:36.533 --> 19:38.000
Here, come in, come in.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.268
Thank you.

19:39.270 --> 19:40.772
Thank you so much.

19:42.173 --> 19:44.206
I was walking for
nearly half an hour.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.008
I didn't see a house or a car.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.609
Here, I'll take your coat.

19:47.611 --> 19:48.878
Have a seat.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.015
- I'll get you a blanket.
- I appreciate it.

20:05.930 --> 20:08.363
I'm gonna turn up the heat
so it's nice and toasty.

20:08.365 --> 20:09.433
That would be nice.

20:12.103 --> 20:14.636
I tried to call
for a tow truck but

20:14.638 --> 20:16.872
- I couldn't get a signal.
- Here you go.

20:16.874 --> 20:17.907
Yeah, it's like that out here.

20:17.909 --> 20:19.410
We don't get any reception.

20:20.277 --> 20:22.477
We don't have a landline.

20:22.479 --> 20:25.347
Would it be too much to
ask for a ride into town?

20:25.349 --> 20:27.685
That was I can call for
a truck and get a hotel?

20:28.652 --> 20:30.152
This is my wife Mindy.

20:30.154 --> 20:31.754
I was just about to tell her
that she could stay the night

20:31.756 --> 20:33.789
and I'll take her to
town in the morning.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.691
Is that all right for you?
Sorry to impose.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.494
It's just that I
was in an accident.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.331
Can you come here for a sec?

20:42.233 --> 20:43.833
How could you invite
a complete stranger

20:43.835 --> 20:45.868
to spend the night
without asking me first?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.469
She's freezing and she's tired

20:47.471 --> 20:48.904
and I honestly don't feel like

20:48.906 --> 20:50.572
going all the way into town

20:50.574 --> 20:52.875
and having to drive
all the way back.

20:52.877 --> 20:53.811
I should go.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.679
You don't have to.

20:57.681 --> 20:58.816
I don't wanna impose.

20:59.851 --> 21:01.052
I insist, it's fine.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.288
What's your name?
Martha.

21:06.190 --> 21:07.124
Martha Cunningham.

21:08.259 --> 21:09.458
Just make yourself
at home, Martha,

21:09.460 --> 21:10.995
and I'll go make you some soup.

21:13.831 --> 21:15.364
We have a guest bedroom.

21:15.366 --> 21:17.769
Whenever you're ready for
bed, you're welcome to it.

21:20.437 --> 21:21.739
You must be a Christian.

21:26.143 --> 21:27.409
I used to be.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.412
I haven't been to
church in a while.

21:29.947 --> 21:31.448
But you believe in God?

21:32.549 --> 21:34.216
Oh yeah, of course.

21:34.218 --> 21:35.052
The Bible?

21:37.188 --> 21:39.456
There are some parts
I'm not so sure about.

21:40.524 --> 21:42.591
I believe in all of it.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.996
And I try to follow
of its teachings.

21:47.498 --> 21:50.132
I'm sure that makes
you a very good person.

21:50.134 --> 21:50.968
I try.

21:52.703 --> 21:54.071
Are you a Christian, Mindy?

21:55.572 --> 21:56.407
Not really.

21:57.641 --> 21:59.674
I think the churches
become corporations

21:59.676 --> 22:01.212
that put on miracles for money.

22:03.047 --> 22:05.516
I suppose you're right
about that aspect of it.

22:06.717 --> 22:09.251
But it's way more
complex than that.

22:09.253 --> 22:11.286
Do you have any children?

22:11.288 --> 22:12.123
Not yet.

22:13.390 --> 22:14.625
But you're expecting.

22:15.726 --> 22:19.294
- How did you...
- Just a guess.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.131
Am I right?

22:21.065 --> 22:21.899
Yes.

22:23.034 --> 22:24.735
You have a certain
glow about you.

22:25.736 --> 22:27.036
What about you?

22:27.038 --> 22:27.872
Any kids?

22:30.074 --> 22:32.407
I had a daughter.

22:32.409 --> 22:33.310
You had?

22:35.880 --> 22:36.948
She died.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.682
I'm so sorry.

22:40.684 --> 22:41.853
Was it an accident?

22:43.420 --> 22:45.056
A bad man killed her.

22:46.723 --> 22:48.025
Did they ever catch him?

22:49.093 --> 22:50.392
No.

22:50.394 --> 22:52.895
And I don't think
they ever will.

22:52.897 --> 22:54.866
But I'm sure he'll
pay for what he did.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.835
How can you be sure of that?

22:59.937 --> 23:01.472
Because I believe in the Bible

23:02.874 --> 23:05.977
and it says "an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth".

23:07.378 --> 23:09.813
I think that also means
a life for a life.

23:12.316 --> 23:13.150
He'll pay.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.067
Thank you.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.702
Do you mind if I say grace?

23:33.704 --> 23:34.571
No, not at all.

23:41.412 --> 23:42.513
Heavenly Father,

23:43.814 --> 23:46.815
thank you for this nourishment
I'm about to receive

23:46.817 --> 23:48.652
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.656
Bless this kind family
who took me from the cold.

23:54.358 --> 23:58.727
And I also pray that
you take my daughter

23:58.729 --> 24:01.098
into the light of
everlasting life

24:03.267 --> 24:06.437
and punish however
You may see fit

24:07.571 --> 24:11.308
that evil man who
snuffed out her life.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.612
In Jesus' name I pray.

24:16.613 --> 24:17.448
Amen.

24:22.453 --> 24:24.956
The Bible says ask
and you shall receive.

24:26.357 --> 24:29.326
This is something I've
wanted more than anything.

24:39.236 --> 24:40.471
This is very good, Mindy.

25:20.377 --> 25:22.144
What are you
doing in the dark?

25:22.146 --> 25:23.979
I couldn't sleep.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.316
It's like that most nights.

25:30.554 --> 25:32.187
I took a cup of your milk.

25:32.189 --> 25:34.556
Sometimes warm milk helps.

25:34.558 --> 25:35.559
Not a problem.

25:37.194 --> 25:38.962
You have a very
handsome husband.

25:39.896 --> 25:41.432
Yeah, I do.

25:42.866 --> 25:44.801
You must have trouble
keeping other women away.

25:45.869 --> 25:47.436
I trust him.

25:47.438 --> 25:48.337
What about your husband?

25:48.339 --> 25:49.273
Is he handsome too?

25:50.574 --> 25:51.542
He was.

25:52.709 --> 25:55.046
But he had a very
lustful disposition.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.515
Would you have
some milk with me?

26:00.117 --> 26:01.885
It's not a bad idea.

26:25.309 --> 26:27.309
I like the way you
keep this kitchen.

26:27.311 --> 26:28.810
It's very neat.

26:28.812 --> 26:30.312
Clean.

26:30.314 --> 26:31.815
Everything in its right place.

26:33.617 --> 26:35.419
Do you plan on having
other children?

26:36.820 --> 26:39.521
We wanna have one more,
maybe two later down the line.

26:39.523 --> 26:40.955
That's good.

26:40.957 --> 26:42.859
Being an only child is no fun.

26:44.027 --> 26:45.296
Were you an only child?

26:46.530 --> 26:48.132
I was lucky I had a sister.

26:49.933 --> 26:51.302
We were very close.

26:52.336 --> 26:53.602
We still are.

27:05.949 --> 27:07.451
- Are you finished?
- Mm-hmm.

27:12.789 --> 27:13.722
I'm so sorry.

27:13.724 --> 27:14.956
It's fine.

27:14.958 --> 27:16.358
It's just a glass.
I'm really clumsy.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.792
It's fine, I got it.

28:07.411 --> 28:08.245
Hey.

28:10.547 --> 28:11.680
Cord?

28:11.682 --> 28:12.947
Hm-mmm.

28:12.949 --> 28:13.784
Cord!

28:16.220 --> 28:18.121
- Keep calling.
- Cord!

28:21.192 --> 28:22.023
Cord!

28:29.666 --> 28:30.701
Stop.

28:32.703 --> 28:33.902
What the hell is going on?

28:33.904 --> 28:35.870
Do you see this?

28:35.872 --> 28:37.339
That's her carotid artery.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.611
If I slice it, she'll die
in less than a minute.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.812
I swear to God,
if you hurt her

28:43.814 --> 28:44.615
I'll kill you.

28:48.985 --> 28:49.820
Put them on.

28:51.455 --> 28:54.057
- If you think...
- I'm gonna count to three

28:55.292 --> 28:56.225
and then I slice.

28:56.227 --> 28:57.526
One.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.027
What is it you want, money?

28:59.029 --> 29:00.862
I'll write you a check, just
tell me how much you want.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.997
Why are you doing this?

29:02.999 --> 29:04.235
What did we do to you?

29:05.902 --> 29:06.737
Take the car.

29:08.071 --> 29:09.271
Two.

29:09.273 --> 29:10.106
Take them!

29:11.875 --> 29:13.076
Do it, Cord!

29:14.144 --> 29:15.946
Jesus Christ, take it, Cord!

29:17.614 --> 29:19.013
This has gone far enough.

29:19.015 --> 29:21.683
If you think that
I'm gonna put...

29:21.685 --> 29:24.586
You don't have a choice, Cord.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.822
You're not gonna make it.

29:26.957 --> 29:28.792
You'll lose two
lives instead of one.

29:30.727 --> 29:34.231
Do what the fuck
she says, Cord!

29:44.308 --> 29:46.810
Now put one of 'em
on your left wrist.

29:57.388 --> 29:59.020
Good.

29:59.022 --> 30:01.625
Now the other one to
the pipe under the sink.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.522
Now we're gonna
play a little game

30:32.923 --> 30:35.058
and this is how we're gonna
get to know each other.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.192
Is that what this is about?

30:38.194 --> 30:39.029
A game?

30:40.096 --> 30:41.965
It's a very simple game.

30:43.700 --> 30:47.569
We're gonna ask each other
questions and tell the truth.

30:47.571 --> 30:48.570
How the hell
are you gonna know

30:48.572 --> 30:49.906
if we're telling the truth?

30:51.742 --> 30:52.576
I'll know.

30:53.944 --> 30:55.479
What do you mean you'll know?

30:56.547 --> 30:58.682
It was my job for years.

30:59.916 --> 31:01.616
I would learn to tell if
someone was lying to me

31:01.618 --> 31:02.719
by watching them.

31:04.054 --> 31:08.559
Looking in their eyes,
watching their body language,

31:09.426 --> 31:11.395
their breathing pattern.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.331
And I was never wrong, not once.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.866
What happens when
the game is over?

31:17.868 --> 31:18.869
Will you let us go?

31:23.006 --> 31:24.274
That depends.

31:26.477 --> 31:27.644
I'll go first.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.047
My parents, they were
in a car accident

31:33.049 --> 31:35.950
and then left me and
my sister all alone.

31:35.952 --> 31:38.219
So we went to live with
my aunt and my uncle,

31:38.221 --> 31:39.754
and he was a deacon.

31:39.756 --> 31:43.059
And so he made us read the
Bible every single night.

31:44.928 --> 31:46.630
But she went off to college

31:47.564 --> 31:49.099
and I married my boyfriend.

31:51.568 --> 31:52.536
Got pregnant.

31:55.238 --> 31:57.107
Got divorced two years later.

31:59.476 --> 32:00.310
But I,

32:02.012 --> 32:04.014
I got custody of my daughter.

32:32.208 --> 32:33.243
Uncuff from the pipe.

32:50.026 --> 32:50.861
Do it!

32:53.864 --> 32:54.698
Faster.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.135
Now cuff it behind your back.

33:11.181 --> 33:13.917
Get behind the counter
or I'll slice her throat.

33:44.748 --> 33:48.316
You are gonna go see
who's in the door,

33:48.318 --> 33:50.952
and if you say anything,

33:50.954 --> 33:52.854
I will slice his throat!

34:26.422 --> 34:27.257
Howdy, Mindy.

34:28.291 --> 34:29.123
Hi, Sheriff.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.458
What's going on?

34:31.460 --> 34:33.928
You guys hear about
the manhunt going on?

34:33.929 --> 34:34.764
Manhunt?

34:36.232 --> 34:38.667
We had a female patient
escape Providence Asylum,

34:38.668 --> 34:40.034
Martha Cunningham.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.237
She killed three people.

34:42.806 --> 34:44.338
The asylum?

34:44.340 --> 34:45.438
Yeah, the asylum.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.676
It's been on the news all day.

34:47.678 --> 34:50.244
We haven't had a chance
to see the news today.

34:50.246 --> 34:52.447
You guys see anything
suspicious out here?

34:59.890 --> 35:00.691
No.

35:01.858 --> 35:03.692
Okay, all right.

35:03.694 --> 35:05.393
Well lock your doors
and your windows.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.329
Call us if you have
any trouble, all right?

35:08.331 --> 35:10.098
Okay, I will.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.299
Okay.

35:11.301 --> 35:12.500
Say hi to Cord for me.

35:12.502 --> 35:13.637
- I will.
- Night.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.315
Get back on the ground.

35:57.247 --> 36:00.048
You had better
not said anything.

36:00.050 --> 36:01.752
I didn't, I didn't.

36:17.533 --> 36:20.236
Yes, that was
my in the asylum.

36:22.072 --> 36:24.975
I couldn't deal with
my daughter's death.

36:38.521 --> 36:42.859
And they treated me like
a fucking dog in there.

37:12.956 --> 37:17.493
My daughter was such
a wonderful child.

37:19.462 --> 37:20.363
Sweet.

37:21.965 --> 37:23.867
So innocent.

37:28.538 --> 37:32.008
Absolutely everything
I could ask for.

37:44.755 --> 37:46.089
Your turn, Cord.

37:47.958 --> 37:49.960
Why did you marry Mindy?

37:51.627 --> 37:52.929
Because I love her.

37:54.765 --> 37:55.966
Do you still love her?

37:56.867 --> 37:58.432
More than ever.

37:58.434 --> 38:00.935
Were you ever
unfaithful to your wife?

38:00.937 --> 38:02.270
Of course not.

38:02.272 --> 38:03.606
- The truth, Cord!
- No.

38:05.008 --> 38:08.176
I'm gonna give you one last
chance to tell the truth.

38:08.178 --> 38:10.111
Were you ever
unfaithful to your wife?

38:10.113 --> 38:11.245
No!

38:11.247 --> 38:13.281
Were you ever
unfaithful to your wife?

38:13.283 --> 38:14.983
No, leave her alone.

38:14.985 --> 38:17.318
You crazy bitch, I'm
telling the truth.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.888
There was never anybody else.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.990
He's telling the truth.

38:21.992 --> 38:24.258
We have a great sex life.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.328
Were you ever
unfaithful to your wife?

38:27.330 --> 38:28.797
No!

38:28.799 --> 38:32.936
If you really love her,
you'll tell the truth.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.505
Okay, yes.

38:36.406 --> 38:37.808
Is that what you wanna hear?

38:39.075 --> 38:39.910
Finally!

38:45.615 --> 38:46.582
How old was she?

38:47.750 --> 38:48.584
30?

38:50.620 --> 38:51.687
25?

38:54.657 --> 38:55.491
18?

38:56.993 --> 38:58.694
18, that's it.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.397
That's pretty young.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.069
18.

39:07.537 --> 39:09.072
That's pretty young, Cord.

39:11.774 --> 39:13.476
Did you tell her
you were married?

39:15.812 --> 39:18.181
Did you tell her you
were married, Cord?

39:20.683 --> 39:23.319
Did you tell her that you
were gonna leave your wife?

39:24.354 --> 39:25.686
Did you, Cord?

39:25.688 --> 39:27.555
Okay, yes.

39:27.557 --> 39:28.959
Is that what you wanna hear?

39:31.261 --> 39:34.162
Don't you feel better, Cord?

39:34.164 --> 39:35.930
The Bible was right again.

39:35.932 --> 39:37.968
The truth will set you free.

39:39.435 --> 39:41.604
It's what she wants to hear.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.608
Why didn't you
leave your wife, Cord?

39:46.977 --> 39:48.676
And I'll know if you're
telling the truth.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.644
Because I love her.

39:50.646 --> 39:53.147
You mean everything to
me, you and the baby.

39:53.149 --> 39:54.849
Do you seriously
think I would ever do

39:54.851 --> 39:56.985
something like that to you?

39:56.987 --> 39:57.852
Who was she?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.287
There is no she!

39:59.289 --> 40:00.754
What's her name?

40:00.756 --> 40:01.923
We'll talk about this,

40:01.925 --> 40:05.126
just not under
these circumstances.

40:05.128 --> 40:06.194
Yeah?

40:06.196 --> 40:07.563
Through our lawyers.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.671
My daughter and I...

40:17.840 --> 40:19.509
We were so close.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.625
My daughter and I...

40:38.228 --> 40:40.463
We were so close.

40:41.797 --> 40:44.434
She used to tell me
all her little secrets.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.071
Her fear of spiders.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.274
The first boy she
had a crush on.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.247
And then the first
boy who kissed her.

41:01.084 --> 41:03.286
She was so young.

41:04.854 --> 41:06.156
So innocent.

41:10.660 --> 41:11.594
And then...

41:27.944 --> 41:29.577
I'm cumming, I'm cumming.

41:36.686 --> 41:37.618
Sorry to keep you waiting.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.852
I had some work to finish.

41:38.854 --> 41:41.622
Work, is that
what you call that?

41:41.624 --> 41:42.458
Excuse me?

41:43.960 --> 41:46.060
Have you no shame?

41:46.062 --> 41:48.096
No decency?
What are you talking about?

41:48.098 --> 41:49.897
I am talking about
you riding around

41:49.899 --> 41:51.832
like a slut up in that office.

41:51.834 --> 41:54.969
Are you spying on me,
is that what you're doing?

41:54.971 --> 41:58.106
You grew up in a
Christian home, Melanie.

41:58.108 --> 41:59.407
You grew up with a Bible.

41:59.409 --> 42:02.110
I don't even believe
in the Bible anymore.

42:02.112 --> 42:03.013
It's all bullshit.

42:04.347 --> 42:06.080
You need to repent
for those words

42:06.082 --> 42:08.983
and you need to repent for
your sin with that man.

42:08.985 --> 42:10.253
He isn't just a man.

42:11.721 --> 42:14.255
His name is Cord Lawrence
and we're getting married.

42:14.257 --> 42:15.623
Married?

42:15.625 --> 42:17.560
That will not wipe
away your sin.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.994
When's the wedding?

42:19.996 --> 42:22.230
In a couple of months once
this divorce goes through.

42:22.232 --> 42:23.831
Are you saying he's married?

42:23.833 --> 42:26.036
They are the only
people that get divorced.

42:27.303 --> 42:29.570
Melanie, the Bible
clearly states...

42:29.572 --> 42:31.772
I could care less
what the Bible states.

42:31.774 --> 42:33.441
We love each other and
we're getting married

42:33.443 --> 42:36.910
and the baby...
Baby?

42:36.912 --> 42:38.381
What baby?

42:39.649 --> 42:41.449
The one I'm carrying.

42:41.451 --> 42:42.285
Cord's and mine.

42:43.453 --> 42:44.885
You'll love him.

42:44.887 --> 42:48.556
He's handsome and educated
and rich and sweet.

42:48.558 --> 42:51.159
And married!

42:51.161 --> 42:54.362
He doesn't love her anymore,
he's told me a dozen times.

42:54.364 --> 42:56.430
- And you believe him?
- Of course I believe him.

42:56.432 --> 42:58.799
Oh, men lie, Melanie.

42:58.801 --> 42:59.933
They lie all the time.

42:59.935 --> 43:01.602
They will say anything it takes

43:01.604 --> 43:04.372
just to get in between
the legs of innocent

43:04.374 --> 43:06.307
gullible girls.

43:06.309 --> 43:07.975
They will tell you anything

43:07.977 --> 43:12.046
just to stick their tools
of Satan inside of you.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.615
He will never
marry you, Melanie.

43:14.617 --> 43:15.485
You're wrong.

43:16.586 --> 43:18.252
You don't know
what's in the heart...

43:18.254 --> 43:20.221
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.956
So should we go or do
I need to walk home

43:22.958 --> 43:24.260
as punishment for my sins?

44:22.185 --> 44:24.084
He won't divorce his wife.

44:24.086 --> 44:27.020
Then you must get rid of
the seed of this abomination

44:27.022 --> 44:28.656
or we will be the
entire laughingstock

44:28.658 --> 44:29.890
of the whole church!

44:29.892 --> 44:31.592
I don't care what
anyone at church says.

44:31.594 --> 44:33.361
I'm not killing my child.

44:33.363 --> 44:36.029
If thy right eye offend
thee then pluck it out.

44:36.031 --> 44:38.232
God, would you shut
up with the stupid

44:38.234 --> 44:40.134
fucking Bible verses!

44:40.136 --> 44:42.002
They are the words of God.

44:42.004 --> 44:43.273
Just get out.

44:44.740 --> 44:47.675
You must get rid of the
spawn of your sinful life.

44:47.677 --> 44:49.845
Leave me the fuck alone!

45:14.404 --> 45:15.369
No!

45:15.371 --> 45:16.604
No, Melanie.

45:16.606 --> 45:17.805
Wake up.

45:17.807 --> 45:19.207
Melanie, wake up.

45:19.209 --> 45:20.042
No!

45:21.544 --> 45:25.045
Cord Lawrence, you
did this to her!

45:25.047 --> 45:27.948
Cord Lawrence, you will pay!

45:51.006 --> 45:52.775
You killed my child.

45:53.943 --> 45:56.844
You killed my Melanie.

45:56.846 --> 45:58.546
I don't know
anyone named Melanie.

45:58.548 --> 46:00.614
This is all a big mistake.

46:00.616 --> 46:01.849
A mistake?

46:01.851 --> 46:04.418
Your name is Cord
Lawrence, isn't it?

46:04.420 --> 46:05.586
I'm telling you!

46:05.588 --> 46:07.821
I don't know anyone
named Melanie.

46:07.823 --> 46:10.157
You took advantage
of her, Cord.

46:10.159 --> 46:12.428
She'd never even
been in love before.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.464
It was so easy to
make her believe

46:16.466 --> 46:18.399
that you loved her
when you told her,

46:18.401 --> 46:20.000
to make her think that you were

46:20.002 --> 46:22.303
gonna leave your wife for her!

46:22.305 --> 46:23.871
What do I have to say
to make you believe me?

46:23.873 --> 46:26.073
I don't know a Melanie!

46:26.075 --> 46:30.179
You took my child, now
I'm gonna take yours.

46:31.614 --> 46:34.915
That's what the good book
says, an eye for an eye.

46:34.917 --> 46:35.751
You'll what?

46:36.686 --> 46:38.354
Just the child, Mindy.

46:39.422 --> 46:41.555
Just his child.

46:41.557 --> 46:43.457
She's my child, too.

46:43.459 --> 46:45.959
An innocent, unborn baby.

46:45.961 --> 46:49.096
Your daughter, she
was a grown woman.

46:49.098 --> 46:50.531
She knew what she
was getting into

46:50.533 --> 46:53.033
when she started an
affair with a married man.

46:53.035 --> 46:54.234
I don't know what
I have to tell you

46:54.236 --> 46:55.135
to make you believe me.

46:55.137 --> 46:56.937
I don't know a Melanie.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.639
You're not a good liar, Cord.

46:58.641 --> 47:01.542
If you believe that
I did it, then kill me.

47:01.544 --> 47:03.846
Just don't hurt my
wife or my baby.

47:05.014 --> 47:07.317
That'll be way too easy.

47:08.818 --> 47:11.385
You need to watch
your child die,

47:11.387 --> 47:12.888
just like I watched mine.

47:15.391 --> 47:17.190
That way she'll get peace.

47:17.192 --> 47:19.329
And I can sleep at night.

47:22.197 --> 47:23.032
Now...

47:25.701 --> 47:27.770
We could do this the hard way

47:29.238 --> 47:30.740
or a more civilized way.

47:31.707 --> 47:32.742
Your choice.

47:37.613 --> 47:38.448
This.

47:39.915 --> 47:41.517
This one your take by mouth.

47:43.719 --> 47:45.488
It softens the cervix.

47:47.723 --> 47:50.391
Increases uterine contractions,

47:50.393 --> 47:52.194
allows the fetus to pass.

47:54.296 --> 47:57.600
This one, you can take by mouth

47:58.768 --> 48:00.670
or I can insert it
into your vagina

48:01.871 --> 48:03.671
and that completes
the abortion process.

48:03.673 --> 48:04.805
You're crazy!

48:04.807 --> 48:06.807
You sick bitch.

48:06.809 --> 48:08.609
She's a baby.

48:08.611 --> 48:10.012
An innocent baby!

48:16.452 --> 48:17.953
Open your mouth.

48:20.690 --> 48:22.625
Open your mouth, Mindy!

48:27.863 --> 48:28.962
You're sick!

48:28.964 --> 48:31.198
You crazy bitch!

48:31.200 --> 48:32.633
Shut up, Cord.

48:32.635 --> 48:33.901
You caused it.

48:33.903 --> 48:35.969
You fucking caused it!

48:35.971 --> 48:39.006
All of this is
your fucking fault!

48:39.008 --> 48:40.608
Get off of her!

48:40.610 --> 48:42.510
Get the fuck off of her!

48:42.512 --> 48:43.844
You caused it.

48:43.846 --> 48:46.747
You fucking caused
it, all of this!

48:46.749 --> 48:47.950
It's your fucking fault.

48:51.086 --> 48:51.921
Open up.

49:02.297 --> 49:03.198
Let me see.

49:07.970 --> 49:08.971
Good girl.

49:11.173 --> 49:12.107
I'm sorry, honey.

49:13.676 --> 49:14.644
I'm so sorry.

49:20.082 --> 49:20.916
Take it.

49:23.118 --> 49:23.953
What?

49:24.820 --> 49:25.755
Now cut yourself.

49:27.089 --> 49:28.121
What?

49:28.123 --> 49:30.591
Let the warm blood flow

49:30.593 --> 49:32.695
so you may be
cleansed of your sin.

49:34.229 --> 49:36.597
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

49:36.599 --> 49:38.298
Cut yourself.

49:38.300 --> 49:42.335
Down to the shin bone so you
may be cleaned of your sin!

49:42.337 --> 49:43.704
This is bullshit.

49:43.706 --> 49:45.973
If you think that I'm going to...

49:45.975 --> 49:50.279
Cut and you will feel
the pain that I felt, Cord.

49:51.213 --> 49:52.047
Five.

49:54.484 --> 49:56.719
Cut and you will be saved.

49:58.488 --> 49:59.321
Four.

50:01.423 --> 50:02.257
Pain.

50:03.693 --> 50:05.360
It's the cleanser of the soul.

50:06.929 --> 50:10.097
And without cleansing
there is no absolution.

50:10.099 --> 50:13.235
And without absolution,
there is no salvation!

50:14.303 --> 50:15.137
Three.

50:17.540 --> 50:20.340
Cleanse your soul, Cord.

50:20.342 --> 50:24.144
This is your last
chance for salvation!

50:24.146 --> 50:26.780
- You need help.
- Shut up!

50:26.782 --> 50:27.617
Two.

50:31.987 --> 50:33.621
- One.
- Okay!

50:33.623 --> 50:34.456
I'll do it.

50:43.499 --> 50:44.399
Are you satisfied?

50:45.300 --> 50:46.468
You sick cunt!

50:48.337 --> 50:49.737
No.

50:49.739 --> 50:50.573
Again.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.013
Again!

51:03.719 --> 51:04.554
Again!

51:08.023 --> 51:08.858
Again!

51:17.933 --> 51:18.768
Fuck.

51:28.210 --> 51:29.712
Are you satisfied?

51:35.785 --> 51:36.619
Yes.

51:39.855 --> 51:40.690
For now.

51:48.163 --> 51:48.964
Come in.

51:51.533 --> 51:53.268
It's cold as hell out there.

51:55.070 --> 51:57.172
From what I understand,
hell ain't cold.

51:59.408 --> 52:00.874
Hi, I'm Jerry Lawson,

52:00.876 --> 52:03.844
Deputy Head of Security
from Providence Asylum.

52:03.846 --> 52:05.245
The higher ups thought that

52:05.247 --> 52:08.015
I could be of some assistance
in bringing in Martha.

52:08.017 --> 52:09.819
They want her caught
but not killed.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.586
It's nice to meet you, Jerry.

52:12.588 --> 52:13.723
We want the same thing.

52:15.024 --> 52:17.057
I have a file right
here on my computer.

52:17.059 --> 52:18.726
I thought we could
look at it together

52:18.728 --> 52:20.295
just in case we miss something.

52:21.230 --> 52:22.262
Sounds good.

52:22.264 --> 52:23.398
Bring it over the desk.

52:40.449 --> 52:43.285
This is her when she was
brought in 12 years ago.

52:44.486 --> 52:46.954
Since then she's gotten
more and more confused,

52:46.956 --> 52:48.157
especially with time.

52:49.324 --> 52:51.226
She totally lost it
when Melanie died.

52:52.928 --> 52:54.094
Who's Melanie?

52:54.096 --> 52:56.063
It's her baby sister.

52:56.065 --> 53:00.500
She consistently refer
to her as her daughter.

53:00.502 --> 53:02.670
I told you to get out.

53:02.672 --> 53:05.138
You have offended
the almighty God

53:05.140 --> 53:06.239
with your adultery.

53:06.241 --> 53:09.109
Shut the fuck up and get out.

53:09.111 --> 53:12.880
God has instructed me
to ask you to repent.

53:12.882 --> 53:14.614
God spoke to you?

53:14.616 --> 53:15.683
Yes!

53:15.685 --> 53:16.950
He did.

53:16.952 --> 53:19.286
And He wants you to
ask for forgiveness.

53:19.288 --> 53:21.789
Well I'm not sorry
for a damn thing.

53:21.791 --> 53:24.591
Cord and I will marry and
he will divorce his wife,

53:24.593 --> 53:25.527
he just needs tome.

53:26.696 --> 53:29.462
God destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah

53:29.464 --> 53:32.666
because they did not repent
for their wicked ways

53:32.668 --> 53:35.202
and he will destroy you too.

53:35.204 --> 53:37.506
Fuck you and your bullshit.

53:38.941 --> 53:42.011
God has anointed me
to be His instrument.

53:43.212 --> 53:44.947
His instrument to do what?

53:46.381 --> 53:50.684
To destroy you and the
seed of your transgression

53:50.686 --> 53:53.588
so that your souls may be saved.

53:54.656 --> 53:56.291
You crazy bitch.

53:57.359 --> 53:58.260
No, no, no!

54:00.629 --> 54:03.265
You will be washed with blood!

54:05.467 --> 54:08.470
Your salvation will
come with blood.

54:11.273 --> 54:13.843
You will be cleansed with blood

54:16.311 --> 54:18.547
and brought into the light.

54:41.837 --> 54:44.872
Before me stood the darkness

54:44.874 --> 54:46.809
from whence came the light.

54:47.676 --> 54:48.911
I once knew.

54:51.480 --> 54:53.348
Only to find pain.

54:54.449 --> 54:56.085
Only to find suffering.

54:58.120 --> 55:01.023
So I looked to the
Lord and I asked

55:02.091 --> 55:04.726
why is there so much pain?

55:09.098 --> 55:10.199
And He spoke to me

55:11.600 --> 55:12.501
and said though

55:14.603 --> 55:16.872
which was born of the blood

55:18.273 --> 55:23.278
shall be lifted from the
darkness into the light.

55:31.220 --> 55:32.054
And he took

55:35.390 --> 55:39.895
the beautiful precious
child out of the darkness

55:41.296 --> 55:42.865
and into the light.

55:48.603 --> 55:49.438
Now...

55:50.372 --> 55:52.507
Now it's time

55:54.476 --> 55:58.147
to take the seed of the evil one

56:01.116 --> 56:04.119
with his deceit and his lies

56:05.320 --> 56:07.890
out and into the light!

56:13.362 --> 56:14.196
Please!

56:15.164 --> 56:15.998
No!

56:17.032 --> 56:19.034
Leave her alone, you sick fuck!

56:20.202 --> 56:23.303
I'll cut myself again
as deep as you want.

56:23.305 --> 56:25.841
Just leave my innocent
wife and child out of this.

56:29.211 --> 56:30.846
That's not how it works, Cord.

56:32.781 --> 56:37.617
For years, innocent
have been shedding blood

56:37.619 --> 56:38.720
for the guilty.

56:40.055 --> 56:41.924
Open your mouth, Mindy.

56:43.058 --> 56:44.624
I'll take the razor.

56:44.626 --> 56:46.793
Let my blood pay for my sins.

56:46.795 --> 56:49.298
I said open your mouth, Mindy!

56:51.200 --> 56:52.534
May I say a prayer first?

56:53.903 --> 56:55.468
A prayer?

56:55.470 --> 56:57.472
A prayer for the baby.

57:00.809 --> 57:01.710
A short one.

57:07.917 --> 57:09.118
Will you pray with me?

57:17.026 --> 57:19.726
Heavenly Father,
I commend the soul

57:19.728 --> 57:24.166
of my innocent child
into Your care.

57:26.301 --> 57:27.136
I pray.

57:28.303 --> 57:29.636
I pray that you will...

57:35.510 --> 57:39.346
Get the keys!

57:39.348 --> 57:41.681
Mindy, get the keys!

57:53.595 --> 57:56.063
I don't know how much
longer I can hold her.

57:56.065 --> 57:58.531
You run, I can't
hold her much longer!

58:24.559 --> 58:25.894
Not yet, Cord.

59:34.363 --> 59:35.862
Cord, wake up.

59:35.864 --> 59:37.032
Cord, it's me.

59:38.400 --> 59:39.732
It's okay.

59:39.734 --> 59:41.334
- Where is she?
- She's outside.

59:41.336 --> 59:42.469
Hold on a second.

01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:44.564
Okay, we've gotta
get you to a hospital

01:00:44.566 --> 01:00:46.599
before you bleed to death.

01:00:56.711 --> 01:00:58.378
Mindy.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.712
Don't believe in
anything she says.

01:00:59.714 --> 01:01:01.916
We are not talking
about this right now.

01:01:03.252 --> 01:01:04.151
We have to.

01:01:04.153 --> 01:01:05.752
No, we don't.

01:01:05.754 --> 01:01:08.257
The only reason I'm doing
this is to save my baby.

01:01:09.991 --> 01:01:11.558
Our baby.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.559
I swear to God.

01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:14.227
Get up, get up.

01:01:14.229 --> 01:01:15.094
Come on.

01:01:37.352 --> 01:01:39.586
Stella, get back in the car.

01:01:39.588 --> 01:01:40.822
Stella, get back!

01:01:45.093 --> 01:01:46.092
Stella, get in the car.

01:01:46.094 --> 01:01:47.562
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.636
- Get inside.
- What is wrong?

01:01:56.638 --> 01:01:57.737
What is going on?

01:01:57.739 --> 01:01:59.306
What's with the machete?

01:01:59.308 --> 01:02:02.742
Stella, there is a
crazy lady outside.

01:02:02.744 --> 01:02:04.777
She stabbed Cord and she's
trying to hurt the baby.

01:02:04.779 --> 01:02:06.413
Did you call the police?

01:02:06.415 --> 01:02:07.347
We don't have any reception.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.817
You need to see a doctor.

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:13.019
We couldn't get a signal.

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.156
You really
need to see a doctor.

01:02:17.892 --> 01:02:19.494
She disabled the car.

01:02:20.762 --> 01:02:23.696
Stella, why are you here?

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.933
I had this really bad dream
that you guys were in danger.

01:02:26.935 --> 01:02:28.668
I tried calling, I
couldn't get through,

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.737
I thought I'd come out
and make sure you're okay.

01:02:30.739 --> 01:02:32.138
We just need your keys.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.242
Sure, yeah, yeah.

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.712
Goddammit!

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:40.547
The hood is up.

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:42.048
She got the car.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.384
Okay, look, let's get
him away from the window.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.052
What are we gonna do now?

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:48.020
- We wait.
- For what?

01:02:48.022 --> 01:02:49.088
For her to make her next move

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:50.490
or for someone to come get us.

01:02:50.492 --> 01:02:51.791
Okay, look, look.

01:02:51.793 --> 01:02:53.493
I'm gonna go get you
some bandages, okay?

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:54.463
I'll be right back.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.035
This is fucked up.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.270
Yeah, no shit.

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:10.545
Do you see anything?

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.021
Mindy.

01:03:26.328 --> 01:03:29.631
You've been a bad girl, Mindy.

01:03:31.065 --> 01:03:32.901
Put down the machete.

01:03:34.836 --> 01:03:38.338
I'm really quite accurate
with this contraption,

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.108
if I don't say so myself.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:45.880
I said drop the machete.

01:03:47.749 --> 01:03:49.518
I don't wanna shoot but

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:53.154
if you don't put
it down, I will.

01:03:58.226 --> 01:03:59.294
You let her in?

01:04:00.495 --> 01:04:01.296
Why?

01:04:03.532 --> 01:04:05.133
She's my sister.

01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:08.835
Did you think it was by chance

01:04:08.837 --> 01:04:11.239
I came looking for the
housekeeper position?

01:04:12.607 --> 01:04:15.544
I had to find out everything
I could about you,

01:04:17.879 --> 01:04:20.349
so we can make you pay

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:25.251
for what you did
to my beautiful,

01:04:25.253 --> 01:04:26.955
my precious niece.

01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:33.225
I didn't do anything to her.

01:04:33.227 --> 01:04:36.028
I don't even know who
you're talking about.

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.731
I tried to tell her that
but she just wouldn't...

01:04:38.733 --> 01:04:41.035
You're such a pathetic liar!

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:46.573
You're to blame too, Mindy.

01:04:46.575 --> 01:04:48.209
She's to blame too.

01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:52.412
You should've known he
was having an affair.

01:04:52.414 --> 01:04:54.046
I didn't.

01:04:54.048 --> 01:04:56.115
I wasn't looking for anything.

01:04:56.117 --> 01:04:59.419
Then you're a bigger
fool than I thought.

01:04:59.421 --> 01:05:03.523
Men lie and cheat all the time.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:05.326
It's in their DNA.

01:05:09.598 --> 01:05:12.867
Killing our baby won't
bring your niece back.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.106
Well, maybe not.

01:05:21.342 --> 01:05:24.413
But it'll make us feel
a whole lot better.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.317
And you, you don't
deserve the easy way out.

01:05:30.785 --> 01:05:34.956
This time, Mindy, there
will be no praying!

01:05:38.092 --> 01:05:41.362
Handcuff her and hold ler legs.

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:46.833
Let's finish this.

01:05:46.835 --> 01:05:48.302
Yes, sister dear.

01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:07.722
Don't kill him.

01:06:11.325 --> 01:06:12.160
Not yet.

01:06:37.986 --> 01:06:39.488
She didn't go far.

01:09:56.951 --> 01:09:57.884
Joel!

01:09:57.886 --> 01:10:00.152
Joel, it's Mindy, let me in.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:01.087
Joel!

01:10:01.089 --> 01:10:03.324
Joel, let me in, it's Mindy!

01:10:07.896 --> 01:10:09.328
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.898
This crazy lady, she's trying
to kill me and the baby.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.332
Where's Cord?

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:14.166
He's back at the house.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:16.068
She hurt him really bad.

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:17.369
All right, call the sheriff.

01:10:17.371 --> 01:10:18.873
I'll go out front.

01:10:27.481 --> 01:10:28.748
Yeah,
this is Sheriff Brand.

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:29.550
Sheriff?

01:10:30.418 --> 01:10:31.720
Yeah, it's Mindy Lawrence.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.386
Yeah, that crazy lady Martha,

01:10:34.388 --> 01:10:36.222
yeah and her sister Stella.

01:10:36.224 --> 01:10:38.891
Yeah, they're coming
after and my baby.

01:10:38.893 --> 01:10:40.528
No I'm at Joel's
house right now.

01:10:41.595 --> 01:10:42.463
Stay down.

01:10:44.733 --> 01:10:46.598
Cord's at the house,
he's really hurt.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.834
I'll be right over
there, all right?

01:10:47.836 --> 01:10:49.668
We'll send an
ambulance to get Cord.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.569
We'll be there in a few minutes.

01:10:50.571 --> 01:10:51.405
Hang tight.

01:10:53.775 --> 01:10:55.441
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

01:10:55.443 --> 01:10:57.109
What's going on?

01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:59.113
Martha and her sister Stella.

01:11:00.314 --> 01:11:02.283
Stella isn't
related to Martha.

01:11:04.685 --> 01:11:07.553
She was Martha's best
friend at the asylum.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:08.988
The doctors thought
she was well enough

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:10.892
to be discharged six months ago.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.227
Apparently they were wrong.

01:11:14.428 --> 01:11:15.263
Great.

01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:40.586
Dispatch, this is Sheriff Brand.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:42.221
I need an ambulance sent
to the Cord Lawrence

01:11:42.223 --> 01:11:43.756
residence immediately.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.024
Cord Lawrence?

01:11:45.026 --> 01:11:46.558
Yeah, you know him?

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.427
Yeah, he was the guy
who knocked up Melanie

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.162
12 years ago.

01:11:50.164 --> 01:11:51.463
That's impossible.

01:11:51.465 --> 01:11:53.034
Cord would've been 10
years old at the time.

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:57.505
What?

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.910
Cord is named after
his father, Cord Sr.

01:12:02.844 --> 01:12:04.276
Wow.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:05.111
Yeah, come on.

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:05.947
Let's go.

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:43.217
How far away are we?

01:12:44.452 --> 01:12:45.920
Five, maybe four minutes.

01:13:02.536 --> 01:13:04.403
Can't you make it three?

01:13:04.405 --> 01:13:07.075
I have a bad feeling about this.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:58.492
You fucker!

01:17:07.781 --> 01:17:09.217
Oh no no no no.

01:17:10.118 --> 01:17:11.117
No, no.

01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:13.821
No!

01:17:14.688 --> 01:17:15.621
No!

01:17:20.128 --> 01:17:21.560
No!

01:17:21.562 --> 01:17:22.396
No!

01:17:24.132 --> 01:17:24.965
No!

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.133
No, stop!

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:35.002
No!

01:18:57.591 --> 01:19:01.495
I have been waiting for
this moment for years!

01:19:02.796 --> 01:19:04.663
Can't you feel it?

01:19:04.665 --> 01:19:05.864
I can.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.901
The end of your life is coming.

01:19:09.937 --> 01:19:12.871
The end of the whore!

01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:27.521
You're so fucking weak!

01:19:36.264 --> 01:19:37.130
Can you smell it?

01:19:39.767 --> 01:19:41.068
I can, whore!

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:57.349
You killed my Stella!

01:19:57.351 --> 01:19:59.651
My sweet, sweet Stella!

01:19:59.653 --> 01:20:00.488
Whore!

01:20:03.324 --> 01:20:04.157
Fuck you.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:12.831
Convictions of the whore
bearing the seed of evil.

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:15.936
You will burn in
hell for this, Mindy.

01:20:35.856 --> 01:20:38.792
Yeah, I may be a whore
but so was Melanie.

01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:42.930
What did you say?

01:20:45.098 --> 01:20:47.399
What the fuck did you just say?

01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:48.700
Dumb bitch.

01:20:48.702 --> 01:20:52.003
She fucks a married
man, gets pregnant,

01:20:52.005 --> 01:20:53.607
and then kills herself?

01:20:56.176 --> 01:20:58.278
I am going to
fucking kill you!

01:21:36.049 --> 01:21:38.216
How does it feel, whore?

01:21:38.218 --> 01:21:39.653
How does it feel?

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:44.358
You, Cord and the little
baby, are all gonna die.

01:22:00.974 --> 01:22:01.775
No!

01:22:02.943 --> 01:22:03.777
Stop!

01:22:07.648 --> 01:22:08.482
Stop!

01:22:14.622 --> 01:22:15.456
No!

01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:28.967
- It's okay, Mindy!
- No.

01:22:28.969 --> 01:22:31.002
No, Stop!
It's okay.

01:22:31.004 --> 01:22:34.274
Let the cold steel
slip into your body!

01:22:36.944 --> 01:22:41.048
Let it cleanse your blood
through this sacrifice.

01:22:58.999 --> 01:23:00.566
It's time, Mindy.

01:23:00.568 --> 01:23:04.670
Now you and your baby
will die and join Cord!

01:23:13.213 --> 01:23:14.480
Freeze!

01:23:14.482 --> 01:23:15.549
Move and you die!

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:21.121
Drop it.

01:23:24.324 --> 01:23:25.826
Get the hell off of her.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.008
Will the whore kill the saint?

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:44.142
Do it, Mindy!

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:45.278
Martha, shut up!

01:23:46.213 --> 01:23:48.246
She's not gonna stop.

01:23:48.248 --> 01:23:49.781
She won't stop.

01:23:49.783 --> 01:23:52.117
Mindy, you don't want this
kind of blood on your hands.

01:23:52.119 --> 01:23:53.785
- Do it.
- Don't do it.

01:23:53.787 --> 01:23:54.753
Martha, shut up!

01:23:54.755 --> 01:23:55.956
She won't stop.

01:23:57.558 --> 01:23:58.490
Mindy.

01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:00.258
Spill the blood of the lamb.

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.862
I have to do this.

01:24:03.296 --> 01:24:05.430
You'll live with this
for the rest of your life.

01:24:05.432 --> 01:24:10.437
I will find you and
that little devil spawn.

01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:12.871
- Martha, shut up!
- Do it!

01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:14.272
Martha, shut up.

01:24:14.274 --> 01:24:16.808
Mindy, think of Cord.

01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:18.677
Think of the baby.
Spill the blood of the lamb.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.147
It's God's will.

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:23.915
Think of the baby.

01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:27.052
I will find you
and that little baby

01:24:27.054 --> 01:24:30.055
and Cord too.
Martha, shut up.

01:24:30.057 --> 01:24:32.891
Martha, shut the hell up.

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:35.360
- Do it.
- Don't do it.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.294
Do it.

01:24:36.296 --> 01:24:38.163
Martha, shut the hell up.

01:24:38.165 --> 01:24:41.835
Sheriff, you have no
idea what she's done!

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:44.803
You don't want this kind
of blood on your hands.

01:24:44.805 --> 01:24:46.738
- Mindy.
- That's right.

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.206
I won't.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.609
Martha, shut the hell up.

01:24:50.611 --> 01:24:52.045
You don't know!

01:24:52.946 --> 01:24:54.345
Martha, shut up.

01:24:54.347 --> 01:24:57.718
Mindy, think of Cord,
think of the baby.

01:25:02.856 --> 01:25:03.689
That's it, we got it.

01:25:03.691 --> 01:25:04.923
Put it down.

01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:05.759
Put it down.

01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:08.228
Put it down.

01:25:09.462 --> 01:25:10.297
Put it down.

01:25:13.266 --> 01:25:15.836
You don't want this
on your conscience.

01:25:29.983 --> 01:25:31.282
Don't move.

01:25:31.284 --> 01:25:32.718
Don't move.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.721
You're under arrest.

01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:37.088
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:38.690
Anything you say

01:25:38.692 --> 01:25:41.192
can and will be used against you

01:25:41.194 --> 01:25:42.694
in a court of law.

01:25:42.696 --> 01:25:45.196
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:25:45.198 --> 01:25:48.066
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:50.235
one will be presented to you.

01:25:50.237 --> 01:25:51.639
You understand these rights?

01:26:01.982 --> 01:26:03.150
You all right?

01:26:05.185 --> 01:26:06.887
The ambulance
should be here soon.

01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:08.789
Come on.

01:26:10.057 --> 01:26:11.591
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:26:20.668 --> 01:26:22.569
Chopper will be here
in a few minutes.

01:26:25.338 --> 01:26:27.307
Why didn't you
let me kill her?

01:26:29.609 --> 01:26:31.611
It's not how we do
things around here.

01:26:34.848 --> 01:26:37.084
The paramedics are
taking Cord to the ER.

01:26:38.551 --> 01:26:40.618
Hopefully he'll pull through.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:23.294
Yeah, copy.

01:27:23.296 --> 01:27:24.131
10-4.

01:28:08.475 --> 01:28:13.480
1:28:15

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.868
Joel, we'll miss you.

01:33:27.829 --> 01:33:32.829
