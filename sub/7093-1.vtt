WEBVTT

02:33.695 --> 02:35.612
- C-14.
- Right.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.956
Get moving!

02:51.921 --> 02:53.839
Get in there!

02:55.925 --> 02:59.094
Gaerity, here's your playmate back.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.097
Good night, girls.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.738
You like to fight. It's your nature.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.646
Unfortunately, you bastard...

04:48.746 --> 04:51.331
I saw you staying here.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.340
No, you fuckin' don't! Get down!

08:08.863 --> 08:10.473
Lizzy? Lizzy!

08:10.573 --> 08:12.199
Come here.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.813
Happy birthday to you

08:16.913 --> 08:20.525
Happy birthday to you

08:20.625 --> 08:22.693
Happy birthday, dear Lizzy

08:22.793 --> 08:26.004
Happy birthday to you

08:37.808 --> 08:40.336
I wished for Jimmy Dove to be my dad.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.547
You're supposed to keep wishes
to yourself.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.341
- Birthday girl!
- Jimmy!

08:45.441 --> 08:47.760
Ooh! Look at you!

08:47.860 --> 08:50.471
- You've got a new party dress, huh?
- Hey there, Boomer.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.974
- You look gorgeous.
- I know.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.519
My mom bought me this dress
at the mall. It was $18.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.187
$18? Not bad.

08:58.287 --> 09:02.066
- Now, what's this? What's this?
- What's this? What is this thing?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.668
Hey, get it.
Pull it out of there. Pull it!

09:09.298 --> 09:12.425
- A piano! Cool!
- You turn it on here.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.558
Thank you.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.045
If your mom doesn't give you lessons
on that thing, I will.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.690
- Look, Megan. Look what Jimmy got me.
- At your place, maybe.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.387
- You look gorgeous too.
- Thank you.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.723
Whoa!

09:33.823 --> 09:37.393
- Here it is.
- You're such a show-off.

09:37.493 --> 09:41.397
Oh! I like that. I like that.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.066
I'm getting close now. I can feel it.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.002
Ah, yeah! Did I win?

10:05.521 --> 10:07.924
- Boston Bomb Disposal.
- Yeah, Rita. Dove.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.926
Sorry to bug you on your day off.
We got one.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.303
- Yeah. Where?
- M.I.T. The computer lab.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.430
- All right, I'll be over.
- Thanks.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.531
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Bye.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.602
What was that all about?

10:19.702 --> 10:23.231
- It's probably nothing.
- Don't worry about it.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.776
Tell Lizzy I'll make it up to her, okay?

10:26.876 --> 10:29.669
Don't worry about it.
I'll save you some cake.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.783
- Have fun, okay?
- Got to.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.842
Boomer, you stay here.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.196
Fuck! Bombs and butts
are a bad combo, 'Bama.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.477
All the way over into the parking lot.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.980
Hey, J.D.!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.665
Sorry to call you
on your day off, partner.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.485
How can I help you bums?

11:09.585 --> 11:12.154
Dog sniffed out C-4,
about a half a pound of the shit.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.992
Buried inside a computer.
There's a girl hooked up to the thing.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.370
- Second floor, center.
- Her hacker boyfriend got jealous.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.666
He rigged it so she's got to keep
typing. She quits, the building goes.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.335
One more thing.
Before the boy blew his brains out...

11:26.435 --> 11:28.170
he hooked up a counter to the thing.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.506
The hard drive gets full and...

11:30.606 --> 11:34.010
- Who's in there with her?
- Cortez, and his little pal Manfred.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.027
Can I bum a smoke?

11:40.908 --> 11:42.909
Let's do her.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.576
Captain, Manfred is all set to go.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.204
Come on, Manfred.
Don't let me down, boy.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.639
We're almost there, Nancy. Hang on.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.976
Come on, baby. Attaboy.

12:10.813 --> 12:14.884
Okay, Nancy. We're gonna have you
out of here pretty soon.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.470
Don't look over there. Look at me.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.264
J.D., check it out.
Captain's a damn genius.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.240
You like lemonade, Nancy?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.452
A wicked, mad genius.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.831
All right, Mary,
we're almost ready to go.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.652
It's Nancy!

12:32.752 --> 12:35.905
Right. Okay, Cortez...

12:36.005 --> 12:40.326
activate the B-board and get your Cuban
ass and Mary the hell out of there.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.953
Come on, Manfred. Let's go.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.512
Get ready.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.182
Go.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.603
Looks like this thing
might pay for itself yet.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.092
- Get back to the keyboard!
- What is wrong now, you pile of shit?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.650
Nancy, relax.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.950
- Where is she?
- In there.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.969
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.390
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dove.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.811
James Dove.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.967
Cortez, get Manfred out of here.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.653
- Buy him a drink. He could use one.
- Hang on, hang on.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.350
Nancy, what am I doing here?
This was my day off.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.910
They called me in, I come.
But do you think they listen to me?

13:53.415 --> 13:55.901
Forget about Manfred.
Get yourself a drink.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.836
Make it a double.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.741
Hmm. The disk drive sounds funny.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.826
Something's slowin' it down.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.036
I could've told you that.
What are we gonna do?

14:06.136 --> 14:08.263
Gotta get between your legs, Nancy.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.279
Liam, help me.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.220
How much time we got?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.473
How many bytes?

14:53.267 --> 14:54.585
Bytes. How many?

14:54.685 --> 14:58.479
Twenty-four. I don't want to die.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.092
Nance, don't give up on me.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.220
You're doin' great.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.388
There it is.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.324
This is gonna be a piece of cake.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.242
What was that?

15:13.412 --> 15:17.233
Tell me something.
You like red wine or white wine?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.485
I don't give a shit! Just do something!

15:19.585 --> 15:21.252
Red. Me too.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.574
- She loves me.
- Hurry! Now!

15:25.674 --> 15:27.508
She loves me...

15:33.599 --> 15:35.642
Fond of suicide, J.D.?

15:37.353 --> 15:40.589
Could you maybe dispose
of the device, huh, guys?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.133
- Go do your job.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.804
Great work, Jimmy. Dumb, but great work.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.822
Ladies and gentlemen,
the building is still not safe.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.468
Ryan! Don't!

16:46.964 --> 16:48.923
Come on, now.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.094
Pump, ya bastard! Pump! Pump! Pump!

17:04.272 --> 17:07.608
- Who needs the damn bubbles anyhow?
- Hey, Max.

17:08.234 --> 17:11.931
- Hey, Jimmy!
- Thanks for the beer.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.683
Come by for a dip, did ya?

17:14.782 --> 17:18.604
- Not with no bubbles.
- Screw it! Screw the damn bubbles!

17:18.704 --> 17:23.025
All I need anyhow is some hot water
to soak my weary bones.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.085
Believe me, they're weary.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.216
Heard you had yourself a doozy
down at Cambridge today.

17:34.970 --> 17:40.042
You should've taken my advice
and stayed on as a beat cop like I did.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.253
A lot easier dodging bullets than bombs.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.480
When did you know
it was time to get out?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.009
How'd I know it was time to get out?

17:49.109 --> 17:51.553
I think I knew it was time...

17:51.653 --> 17:54.974
as soon as I started asking myself
if I thought it was time.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.992
You've been asking yourself
that question a lot, have ya?

18:01.246 --> 18:04.650
It's time, friend.
You've done your penance.

18:04.750 --> 18:09.003
Yeah? Then why don't I feel absolved?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.116
Don't know, Jimmy.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.159
How come, huh?

18:14.259 --> 18:18.179
Come on. No bubbles,
but the hot water'll do you good.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.942
Hey, fella, drinks. Come on.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.556
- That's for you, my darlin'.
- Thank you.

18:35.656 --> 18:39.476
That's for you, my dear.
Put it on my tab, Francis.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.619
- Cash.
- Cash?

18:43.372 --> 18:45.498
I'll look in me pockets.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.822
Just moments ago, Lt. James Dove of the
Boston Bomb Squad came racing down...

18:51.922 --> 18:54.616
this lawn behind me, helping
a visibly distraught...

18:54.716 --> 18:56.342
Hey, fella!

18:57.177 --> 18:58.954
Fella! Hey!

18:59.054 --> 19:02.765
...that he had no bomb equipment
on as he came out of the building.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.903
James Dove?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.518
Boomer, get down.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.354
...rushing out of M.I.T.
All the police activity indicates...

19:24.454 --> 19:28.067
- Look, Mom. Jimmy's on TV.
- He's been identified as...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.944
Lieutenant James Dove,
who successfully disengaged a device.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.030
They are looking for a secondary device.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.089
See you guys later.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.722
Well, we have a new soloist.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.850
Kate, you appear to be here,
but you're not playing like it.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.519
I'm sorry.

20:03.619 --> 20:07.523
People, please. We've only got three
weeks to put this whole thing together.

20:07.623 --> 20:12.210
We don't want to let down
our founding fathers, do we?

20:13.128 --> 20:16.031
- Do we?
- No!

20:16.131 --> 20:20.536
Fireworks will be popping in the sky.
I want to hear them popping out of you.

20:20.636 --> 20:24.013
Feels like we're playing
with the Patriots, not the Pops.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.308
Let's take it back to letter P.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.833
Excuse me.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.957
How are the muscles?

21:07.057 --> 21:10.419
Mmm, what do you think? Not bad. Hmm?

21:10.519 --> 21:13.172
Looked good on TV too.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.690
Out there showin' off again.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.428
You like being a hero, don't ya?

21:19.528 --> 21:22.347
- Why does it always have to be you?
- It doesn't.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.366
- I was wondering about that. Want more?
- Yeah, thanks.

21:29.413 --> 21:33.025
- I put in for a teaching job.
- Why?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.944
- I beg your pardon?
- That's crazy.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.947
You're good at what you do. You love it.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.783
- We know you're gonna keep doing it.
- I'm putting in for a teaching job.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.885
- I thought you'd love that.
- Pass the cheese, please.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.391
Really. Then what?

21:51.226 --> 21:53.853
You think I love what I do, but I don't.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.843
You think you know me.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.470
You don't.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.972
I can't sleep, okay?

22:04.072 --> 22:06.615
I puke my guts out when I shut one down.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.746
Keep remembering things
I want to forget.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.150
I can't do it anymore. All right?

22:15.250 --> 22:18.085
Everything's different now.
You and Lizzy...

22:19.588 --> 22:21.672
My life's all different.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.093
What?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.221
I guess.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.891
What?

22:32.809 --> 22:35.212
I'm so scared of you
doing this for us...

22:35.312 --> 22:37.438
and then regretting it.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.361
All right.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.636
This is the wrong time?

23:14.101 --> 23:15.601
No regrets, Katie.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.481
- Ever?
- Ever.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.651
Take this thing. Come on.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.654
They need the table. Take it.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.829
Congratulations.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.689
Off you go...

24:17.789 --> 24:19.206
bitch.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.160
The weapons, Liam.
You can never be too safe.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.332
Yes, my fine lady.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.211
Balance in all things.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.663
- Information. What city, please?
- Yes.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.999
In Boston please, for the bomb squad.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.961
- I'd like the address as well.
- One moment, please.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.978
Beep, beep. There we go.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.067
No, ma'am, it's not an emergency.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.167
- Dance? Will you dance with me?
- She's a pretty one.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.210
Save yourself for tonight.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.311
Come here and dance. Ho!

26:36.511 --> 26:37.913
Congratulations.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.332
- Good luck, buddy.
- I'm gonna need it.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.668
Settle down. Hear? Settle down.

26:43.768 --> 26:48.757
Quit your bollocksing around.
It's time to toast the bride and groom.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.442
So, raise your glasses!

26:53.194 --> 26:55.472
Here's to the wings of love.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.516
May they never lose a feather...

26:57.616 --> 27:01.102
as long as his big shoes
and her wee little shoes...

27:01.202 --> 27:03.162
are under the bed together!

27:05.332 --> 27:09.819
And, Jimmy, a word of advice now
that you've retired from the field:

27:09.919 --> 27:14.699
If your married life gets a little dull,
and you start getting restless...

27:14.799 --> 27:17.452
I don't know how that's possible.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.454
You tell him, sweetheart.

27:19.554 --> 27:23.667
Just think of your stupid friends here
diffusin' bombs.

27:23.767 --> 27:28.729
Then thank your lucky stars you're home
watching the telly with your bride.

28:06.559 --> 28:11.006
- Who invited Michael Jackson?
- I don't know. He invited himself.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.384
His name is Anthony Franklin.
Your replacement and my new partner.

28:14.484 --> 28:17.846
Hey, I wouldn't go calling
no damn rookie Jim's replacement.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.181
I don't know.
The more I hear about Franklin...

28:20.281 --> 28:22.783
the better I feel
about Jimbo becoming a teacher.

28:24.452 --> 28:27.272
Decorated by the mayor.
Two years on the SWAT team.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.566
Clarence Thomas's acting coach.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.110
And I hear he's hung like a China mule.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.112
- Who told you that?
- Your wife.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.073
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Hell of a party you're having here.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.842
I'm Anthony Franklin, your replacement.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.290
Yeah, well, so I heard.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.917
Welcome to the party, Tony.

28:48.017 --> 28:52.146
No, it's Anthony. It's Anthony.
I hate abbreviations. You too?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.426
But you didn't know that.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.570
You don't mind me crashing your party?
You know, the team and all.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.933
God, I heard a lot about you.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.186
And I know you heard a lot about me.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.229
I bet you wish you could see
some of my moves.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.248
I saw your moves, Anthony.

29:13.209 --> 29:16.821
I've got my lady waiting downstairs.
Enjoy your retirement, Lieutenant.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.673
- I plan to.
- See you, guys.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.637
Watch yourself. Peace.

29:28.683 --> 29:32.003
- Cocky son of a bitch.
- Yeah. He reminds me...

29:32.103 --> 29:34.646
of a cocky son of a bitch
that I once knew.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.634
Geez, not tonight!

29:37.734 --> 29:40.929
Nothing to be alarmed about.
It's probably just a tease.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.639
Party on!

29:42.739 --> 29:46.033
- We're gonna miss you, Jimmy.
- It's your turn, Blanket. Show 'em how.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.978
Try to come back.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.121
- Save me one dance.
- Okay.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.720
There. Look.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.523
Come here.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.983
Where are you taking me
on our honeymoon? Compost?

30:35.083 --> 30:38.335
Wait a minute. I thought you
were taking me on a honeymoon.

30:40.463 --> 30:43.090
It's Quepos. Costa Rica.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.930
I think you'll like it.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.076
- Bomb squad. Cortez speaking.
- Hey, Robby.

31:27.176 --> 31:30.371
Hey, Jimmy! Mazeltov, buddy.

31:30.471 --> 31:33.124
I'm sorry I couldn't go to the wedding.
Roarke wouldn't give me the day off.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.475
Don't worry. You weren't missed.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.006
- What happened with the call?
- Manfred and I weren't invited.

31:40.106 --> 31:43.817
They're under the River Street Bridge
still trying to shut it down.

31:46.029 --> 31:48.723
Give me a call if you hear anything.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.476
Don't worry about it.
Blanket can handle it.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.895
You concentrate on the missus. Listen.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.564
You need some love tips
from the Cuban missile here?

31:56.664 --> 31:58.983
I'm at the Four Seasons
if you hear anything.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.001
- Adiรณs, buddy.
- Bye.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.130
They'll be all right.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.680
Come on. Let's go back to bed.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.480
Yeah, baby. I got something for you.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.075
Ah! Shit!

32:33.993 --> 32:35.911
Wait a minute.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.550
Put another barrier to keep people out.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.040
Yeah, we're checkin' it out now.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.266
Yeah. All right.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.354
Jimmy. It's Blanket.

33:03.314 --> 33:07.275
He was under the bridge usin'
the shotgun to detonate the device.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.279
It was a simple gig.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.878
Something got screwed up, Jimmy.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.431
Fuck.

33:44.981 --> 33:48.066
And on your wedding day, Liam.

33:59.162 --> 34:04.458
Amazing

34:05.710 --> 34:08.655
Grace

34:08.755 --> 34:13.701
How sweet

34:13.801 --> 34:18.706
The sound

34:18.806 --> 34:22.752
That saves

34:22.851 --> 34:27.215
A wretch

34:27.315 --> 34:31.302
Like me

34:31.402 --> 34:35.598
I once

34:35.697 --> 34:37.391
Was lost, Lord

34:37.492 --> 34:39.435
How'd you fuck up?

34:39.534 --> 34:42.563
But now

34:42.663 --> 34:45.984
I'm so glad I'm found

34:46.083 --> 34:50.737
Was blind

34:50.838 --> 34:53.157
Will you look at this spread now?

34:53.257 --> 34:57.745
Why is it a man always get thrown
his best party when he dies?

34:57.845 --> 34:59.414
Joseph, excuse me.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.125
I don't think the guy stands a chance.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.168
That's the guy you want at the plate
with ducks on the pond.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.422
The bum is hitless
in the last ten at bats.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.856
Here's the pitch. And there's...

35:15.530 --> 35:16.931
Captain.

35:17.031 --> 35:20.601
- I got your replacement for you.
- Who, that Bolinski kid?

35:20.701 --> 35:24.605
No, me. 'Til we get this guy.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.274
You're in retirement, remember?

35:26.374 --> 35:31.195
Fred, the bomb that killed Blanket
was made from scratch.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.948
- The guy distilled the ANFO himself.
- How do you know that?

35:34.048 --> 35:35.867
I tasted it.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.036
Franklin is not ready for this guy.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.204
Franklin is not the only technician
we got.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.624
You've got a blaster out there,
a real one.

35:43.724 --> 35:47.003
The ducks are on the pond.
I'm the one you want at the plate.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.797
- I'll take it under advisement.
- Fred, I know...

35:49.897 --> 35:54.067
- I am trying to watch the game.
- I suggest you go eat.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.420
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Love you. Good night.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.326
- Listen to this. Wait. Here, wait.
- No, no, come on.

36:18.426 --> 36:21.287
Come on, come on. Tomorrow.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.081
In bed.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.223
Attagirl. Night-night.

36:26.058 --> 36:28.002
You smell like beer.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.838
How do you know what beer smells like?

36:30.938 --> 36:32.856
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:36.944 --> 36:40.405
Jimmy, did it hurt Blanket when he died?

36:43.117 --> 36:45.853
No, sweetheart, it didn't.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.440
- Go to sleep now.
- Don't shut the door all the way.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.957
Okay.

37:08.643 --> 37:12.380
Land mines. This sucker here
is particularly nasty.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.715
It's called a Bouncing Betty.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.343
It's buried in the ground.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.512
It clicks when you step on her.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.723
When you step off,
it jumps up to crotch level...

37:22.823 --> 37:25.617
and blows good-bye to whatever
brass balls you might have.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.454
Girlfriend says mine are golden.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.708
She let me know this.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.378
You think this is funny?

37:41.842 --> 37:44.245
Yes, I think Betty is very funny.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.373
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
Come up and take a look at Betty.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.917
Show the kids how you take her down.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.628
Watch and learn.

37:52.728 --> 37:56.273
You have to get under it, get a clean
look at the bitch's firing spring.

37:57.566 --> 37:59.969
- Click.
- Uh-oh.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.028
Now that's funny.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.601
That's nice.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.619
Don't move. Don't move.
That's a live one.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.733
See?

38:13.833 --> 38:15.651
Boomer knew.

38:15.751 --> 38:20.088
Rule number one when you're
disarming Betty: Don't step on her.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.078
Love a challenge.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.081
And my Betty's come with a timer.

38:29.181 --> 38:32.058
You had 60 seconds.
Come on, Boomer. Let's get out of here.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.173
Yeah, run.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.634
Run!

38:39.734 --> 38:43.638
- See school's going well.
- Yeah. I was born to teach.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.308
- You got anything?
- Blanket's coroner's report.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.978
Keep it under your hat, will ya?
Captain's already on my butt.

38:51.078 --> 38:54.414
Wants to know why you got Franklin
back in basic.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.670
That's hilarious.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.661
- He needed some work on his Bettys.
- Thanks, Rita.

39:06.761 --> 39:10.055
- What happened?
- Recess is over.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.836
Thanks for the entertaining
display there, Franklin.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.839
That was Leaping Anthony
and his Bouncing Betty.

39:18.939 --> 39:20.857
I hope you enjoyed that.

39:23.152 --> 39:27.655
Looks like you got a little work
cut out for you, buddy.

39:53.140 --> 39:56.377
- How much for the toy?
- That's Justin's.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.422
- It's not for sale.
- I was hoping to get one for my nephew.

39:59.522 --> 40:02.216
He lives in Dublin.
Can't find such a toy there.

40:02.316 --> 40:06.345
- He's not getting this one.
- It would mean so much to him.

40:06.445 --> 40:10.182
He got hurt in a car accident.
Lost a leg, he did.

40:10.282 --> 40:13.269
- Shouldn't be driving then.
- Justin!

40:13.369 --> 40:15.161
Five dollars.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.024
Ten?

40:18.124 --> 40:20.083
You're a capitalist?

40:22.044 --> 40:25.740
Can I interest you in this U2 tape?
It's only a dollar.

40:25.840 --> 40:30.427
- "U" who?
- U2. You know, the Irish band?

40:31.303 --> 40:33.247
Come on. Everybody knows U2.

40:33.347 --> 40:36.625
You'll have to excuse my ignorance.
I've been out of the mainstream a bit.

40:36.725 --> 40:40.588
But I'll give it a listen,
see what the lads are doin' these days.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.548
You're a caring mother.

40:42.648 --> 40:45.567
It's very pretty.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.891
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.893
You are cruisin' for a bruisin'.

40:53.993 --> 40:57.146
- How many have you eaten of these?
- Four or three.

40:57.246 --> 40:59.815
- You're gonna get sick from that.
- No, I won't!

40:59.915 --> 41:03.710
- Sorry. I only have a 20.
- You can pay me later.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.796
So what are the winds
a-tellin' ya, laddie?

42:33.133 --> 42:36.370
Only the bomb squad
is supposed to be down here.

42:36.470 --> 42:38.831
Aren't you supposed to be
in a classroom somewhere...

42:38.931 --> 42:41.474
tinkerin' around with little toy bombs?

42:43.018 --> 42:44.978
Disarming wasn't an option?

42:45.980 --> 42:47.939
Are you second-guessing me?

42:49.984 --> 42:51.886
It was motion-sensitive.

42:51.986 --> 42:55.890
We found nine triggers. Any one of a
hundred wires could have done the deal.

42:55.990 --> 42:59.617
- One of them had to be a ground.
- Right.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.688
And you would have known
which one to cut, huh?

43:02.788 --> 43:06.817
- Why'd he shoot from here?
- I picked the spot.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.903
It's the safest place.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.739
There's zero likelihood
of shrapnel here.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.575
I don't get it. He was protected.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.676
I don't get it!

43:26.729 --> 43:29.048
Son of a bitch!

43:29.148 --> 43:30.549
Say what?

43:30.649 --> 43:34.261
Most of the bomb's force was aimed
up at the bridge, right?

43:34.361 --> 43:38.474
But the drum is like a bazooka.
There's recoil. Where did the recoil go?

43:38.574 --> 43:41.268
- The overpressure? Hmm?
- The overpressure went down.

43:41.368 --> 43:44.772
- Yeah, down. But then where?
- Down here.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.816
The coroner said that Blanket died
of a concussion.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.876
Hmm? The bastard!

43:52.671 --> 43:55.407
- He bounced it!
- Bounced it?

43:55.507 --> 43:58.635
Are you saying he tried to do this,
he planned for the kickback?

43:59.637 --> 44:02.581
He was playing the bank shot.

44:02.681 --> 44:05.501
Look at the angle. Huh?

44:05.601 --> 44:08.837
He was aiming for Blanket.
Then how would he know where he'd be?

44:08.937 --> 44:12.398
You said it: The safest place.
He knew the shooter'd go right here...

44:13.651 --> 44:16.277
'cause this is exactly where
he wanted him to go.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.990
Then he was trying to kill one of us.
That's what you're saying.

45:04.785 --> 45:07.855
- Hey, Rita.
- Just a tease, Jimmy.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.608
- Where's the device?
- In the trolley.

45:10.708 --> 45:14.361
Hola, Jim.
Our boy did real good today, Jimbo.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.963
- Where is everybody? Where's Roarke?
- Back there.

45:20.134 --> 45:23.845
- Come with mama, baby.
- Vamos, babaloo. Volante! Volante!

45:25.055 --> 45:27.249
Forget about the bridge.
Stay out of the trolley.

45:27.349 --> 45:29.460
I'm goin' to the trolley.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.978
What's the matter, Jimmy?

45:33.147 --> 45:36.315
- Check the area for secondary devices?
- The perimeter is clear.

45:37.359 --> 45:40.346
- Did you print this shit? Is it printed?
- It's all been bagged and tagged.

45:40.446 --> 45:44.308
This theory about Blanket is not enough
reason for you to be on active duty.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.852
Listen to what he's got to say.
There's no harm in listening...

45:46.952 --> 45:49.871
- Back off!
- Fine.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.986
This is not the way to go, man.

45:56.086 --> 46:00.032
Look, I'm just as sick
over Blanket's death as you are.

46:00.132 --> 46:02.785
If somebody wanted to kill one of us,
it wouldn't be much trouble.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.828
He'd just blow the shit out of him.

46:04.928 --> 46:07.638
This is silly putty, not plastique.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.184
You're not makin' any sense!

46:12.352 --> 46:14.979
It's the only way to go, Cap.
It's the only theory.

46:16.148 --> 46:19.760
Let's look at this stuff, see if there's
a connection with what happened there.

46:19.860 --> 46:23.263
Nobody's gonna make fun of him now.
He did a great job today.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.808
- He gets a gold star.
- He's a good boy.

46:25.908 --> 46:28.785
- You treat him like a son.
- Our son.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.441
Damn! Cortez!

46:34.541 --> 46:36.542
Rita!

46:48.639 --> 46:52.683
Out of the way! No!

46:55.729 --> 46:57.313
Get back!

46:58.398 --> 47:00.942
Get back!

48:15.976 --> 48:19.645
Liam, help me.

48:40.667 --> 48:44.571
Hey, talk to me. Look at me.
You all right?

48:44.671 --> 48:46.573
I'm all right! I'm all right!

48:46.673 --> 48:49.091
Get these people out of here.
There might be another device!

49:01.939 --> 49:04.023
Did I catch you at a bad time, Liam?

49:08.362 --> 49:09.930
Ryan Gaerity?

49:10.030 --> 49:11.932
Oops, I called you Liam.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.934
- Is that you?
- Jimmy Dove.

49:14.034 --> 49:18.230
Much more lyrical than Liam McGivney.
Much less Irish.

49:18.330 --> 49:20.941
Listen to me.
I've come to bring you a gift.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.068
What gift is that, Gaerity?

49:23.168 --> 49:25.779
It's the gift of pain, of course.

49:25.879 --> 49:27.698
You're the reason they died.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.950
- Not me!
- Ryan!

49:30.050 --> 49:32.134
Blame, blame, blame.

49:33.595 --> 49:36.806
And I suppose I'm to blame for
the deaths of your new pals as well.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.585
Who's right? Who's wrong?

49:39.685 --> 49:41.587
We were at war.

49:41.687 --> 49:44.464
Your conscience ended up causing
the death of your own, Liam.

49:44.564 --> 49:46.675
You're a bad boy.
You made me trigger the bomb too early.

49:46.775 --> 49:49.970
I was trying to stop you.
You said nobody would get killed.

49:50.070 --> 49:52.389
There was people everywhere!

49:52.489 --> 49:56.143
And look who paid.
Your own sweetheart, your friends, me.

49:56.243 --> 50:00.439
While you've been in America, a hero,
I've been a man without a country.

50:00.539 --> 50:04.250
I spent the last 20 years of my life
in jail or on the run because of you.

50:07.462 --> 50:10.866
Ha, ha, ha!
But don't let me get morose on ya.

50:10.966 --> 50:12.910
Fate's brought us together again.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.872
I've come to Boston. Fine place for
a man to lose himself, wouldn't you say?

50:16.972 --> 50:18.957
And what do I find? My old pal...

50:19.057 --> 50:21.100
on the telly!

50:23.770 --> 50:25.589
If they only knew what you'd done.

50:25.689 --> 50:28.300
I did what I did because you told me
I was a soldier!

50:28.400 --> 50:32.346
- But I never killed anybody!
- Did you ever hear of the Big Bang?

50:32.446 --> 50:36.058
They think the universe was created
from an explosion.

50:36.158 --> 50:40.786
Can you imagine that, Liam?
An explosion!

50:43.290 --> 50:45.666
Goddamn you, Gaerity.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.988
- Look what you've done.
- You've got me all wrong.

50:50.088 --> 50:52.048
I'm not a destroyer.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.035
I'm a creator.

50:55.135 --> 51:00.540
You're not a creator.
You're a sick freak, is what you are.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.877
I've come here to create a new country
for you called chaos...

51:03.977 --> 51:06.270
and a new government called anarchy.

51:07.731 --> 51:10.884
- All for you.
- I can't believe I bought your shit.

51:10.984 --> 51:13.444
Civilians die in war, Liam.

51:14.738 --> 51:18.767
But you disobeyed orders.
You betrayed the cause.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.811
You never gave a damn about the cause.

51:20.911 --> 51:24.398
The only thing that ever turned you on
were your goddamn bombs!

51:24.498 --> 51:27.567
And what lovely ladies they are, Liam.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.569
I was watching out.

51:29.669 --> 51:33.949
Tell me, Liam, how close were you
when she went?

51:34.049 --> 51:38.286
Ryan, why don't you come down here
and face me?

51:38.386 --> 51:42.932
- Could you smell her flower, Liam?
- What? Are you still there?

51:43.809 --> 51:45.711
You're a chickenshit, Ryan.

51:45.811 --> 51:49.881
I've enjoyed talking to you, Liam.
I don't want to be rude, but I must go.

51:49.981 --> 51:51.941
Your new wife and daughter
just got home.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.030
Did you leave the window open?

52:13.130 --> 52:15.032
I don't know. I'll check.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.925
- No, let's put the stuff in the kitchen.
- All right.

52:34.693 --> 52:36.470
Thirsty, bug?

52:36.570 --> 52:39.765
- I'd like red juice, please.
- Okay.

52:39.865 --> 52:41.282
Boomer?

52:45.912 --> 52:47.830
He must've jumped the fence again.

52:52.127 --> 52:55.337
- He'll be back.
- Boomer!

53:00.343 --> 53:04.915
- You wanna make dinner tonight?
- Yeah. Can I invite Sandra?

53:05.015 --> 53:07.600
Sure. I'll call her mom and ask.

53:10.145 --> 53:14.132
- What do you want to make?
- Garlic toast?

53:14.232 --> 53:17.651
You don't like garlic toast, do you?

53:24.534 --> 53:27.328
All around the mulberry bush

53:28.997 --> 53:31.457
The monkey chased the weasel

53:34.586 --> 53:36.629
The monkey thought
it was all so much fun

54:16.169 --> 54:18.238
Send her over. We'll be here.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.005
Okay. Bye.

54:22.342 --> 54:24.494
That's not the oven.
It's the one on the right.

54:24.594 --> 54:26.913
Right, right, right.

54:27.013 --> 54:29.056
Mmm, this one.

54:41.444 --> 54:44.905
No, that's your left. Which hand
do you pledge allegiance with?

54:45.615 --> 54:48.435
Mmm, this one?

54:48.535 --> 54:49.952
Right.

55:17.647 --> 55:19.732
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

55:22.610 --> 55:25.013
Come on. We gotta get outta here.

55:25.113 --> 55:27.974
- Where's Boomer?
- He jumped the fence again.

55:28.074 --> 55:30.852
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

55:30.952 --> 55:33.454
I want you and Lizzy out of here.

56:48.446 --> 56:50.656
Come in here.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.171
Oh, God, Jim.

57:08.216 --> 57:11.786
My name is Liam. Liam McGivney.

57:11.886 --> 57:14.831
- What?
- I'm not from here.

57:14.931 --> 57:17.417
I'm from Ireland.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.852
I was born and raised in Belfast.

57:21.521 --> 57:25.441
We were at war. I was just a kid.
They recruited me off the playground.

57:26.860 --> 57:28.345
One minute...

57:28.445 --> 57:31.598
I'm a kid on the merry-go-round
thinkin' how blue the sky is...

57:31.698 --> 57:35.393
and the next I'm learning how
to turn bleach into bombs.

57:35.493 --> 57:38.605
My whole life I was taught
to hate the English.

57:38.705 --> 57:41.206
- Get them out of Ireland.
- Then you're I.R.A.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.946
- He was too crazy for that.
- Who?

57:47.046 --> 57:50.299
The guy who did this. Ryan Gaerity.

57:51.217 --> 57:54.412
We thought we were soldiers.
I was in love with his sister.

57:54.512 --> 57:56.889
He was my best friend.

57:58.516 --> 58:02.420
He killed my fuckin' dog.

58:02.520 --> 58:06.966
He killed Blanket, he killed Rita,
Cortez. He wants me now.

58:07.066 --> 58:09.844
- Why?
- I screwed up his plans.

58:09.944 --> 58:13.098
I tried to stop his bomb.
The others got killed, he got captured.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.308
I turned my back on him. I left.

58:15.408 --> 58:18.645
I want you to leave.
Go to the Cape. Go to Max's.

58:18.745 --> 58:21.064
- Do it right now.
- This is my home.

58:21.164 --> 58:23.858
Katie, you can't stay around here,
around me.

58:23.958 --> 58:26.335
Do you understand that?

58:28.004 --> 58:30.615
Now, it's safe in there.

58:30.715 --> 58:33.258
Go in, get your stuff and go.

58:34.719 --> 58:36.637
I don't even...

58:38.806 --> 58:41.475
I don't even know who you are.

59:03.289 --> 59:06.901
You're a fighter, huh?
Look at her fight.

59:07.001 --> 59:11.964
Aye, easy now, easy. That's a boy.

59:17.887 --> 59:20.039
Ah, pregnant, huh?

59:20.139 --> 59:24.434
Well, go forth and multiply,
mother mackerel.

59:29.357 --> 59:32.969
You know better than to sneak up
on a man like that when he's fishin'.

59:33.069 --> 59:35.320
Scares the fish.

59:37.532 --> 59:41.060
I heard about what happened today.

59:41.160 --> 59:45.690
Don't know what this city's comin' to.
Bad as bloody Belfast.

59:45.790 --> 59:49.668
Yeah, more than you know.
It was Gaerity.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.572
Give it a rest, Jimmy.

59:52.672 --> 59:55.700
- He's incarcerated for life.
- No, he's out.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.744
- What?
- He killed Blanket with concussion.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.621
He blew Rita and Cortez
out of the truck.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.832
He's taking out the squad
the same way his sister...

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.460
and the others died back in Ireland.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.019
Sweet Jesus!

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.800
He blames me for what happened.
He's probably right.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.094
What are you talking about?

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:20.391
That bomb would've killed hundreds
if it had blown like Gaerity had wanted.

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:23.019
That doesn't matter to Ryan.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:27.607
He's killed three. He'll go for more.
He's already...

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:30.292
He's already threatened Liz and Katie.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:34.197
Oh, Jimmy. Where are they now?

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.715
In your cottage. Hope you don't mind.

01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:40.161
How much she know?

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:43.331
I told her the truth.
I should've a long time ago.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:45.458
Bullshit, you should've!

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:49.519
- She's your wife, not your priest!
- She's my wife.

01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:54.842
- I'm gonna find out what I can.
- No, I don't want you getting involved.

01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:58.278
- I've been involved since...
- I don't want you getting involved!

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.099
Here.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.450
Stay out of this.

01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:11.609
- Where you off to?
- To tell the squad.

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:13.861
You do that and you'll end up
behind bars!

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:18.866
They need you, Jimmy!
You learned from Gaerity.

01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:22.412
You can shut him down!

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:25.456
You tell Captain Roarke and the squad...

01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:28.668
only what they need to know.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.268
Nothin' more.

01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:48.453
We're bein' bombed.

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.566
From this point forward
we only disarm...

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:54.861
when lives are at stake.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.045
We don't go around trying to play hero.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:00.450
We just try and keep each other alive.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.328
- Everybody clear on that?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.539
Sergeant, what's the computer show
on like M.O.s on this guy?

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:11.044
The closest match
was a William Kozolski...

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:14.172
but he's doing life for blowing up
a circuit judge.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:17.550
The Feds are coming up with zeros.
Looks like our boy's a mystery man.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.720
He's no mystery.
His name's Ryan Gaerity.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:25.058
He broke out of Castle Gleigh Prison
in Northern Ireland 14 months ago.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.685
Here's the latest picture.

01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:31.329
According to the report,
he can build bombs out of Bisquick.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:35.943
- Mind telling me where you got this?
- Contacted Interpol.

01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:38.962
They made their own search
and came up with Gaerity.

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:44.243
He's a freelancer.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:46.496
Red Brigade, Libyans.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.555
Why's he after us?

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:59.467
Boston Bomb Disposal.
Yeah, he's right here.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:02.387
'Bama, Connie on two.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.889
Hi, sweetheart.

01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:10.478
Connie, how many times I gotta tell you
I don't believe in that astrology crap?

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.580
Look, let me get back with you.
I gotta go.

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:09.156
Bomb squad. Dove.

01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:12.451
- Lieutenant.
- Franklin?

01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:14.453
- Franklin?
- Lieutenant?

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:17.498
- Franklin, you hear me?
- Are you there?

01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:19.876
You all right?

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:23.061
- You busy?
- Where are you? Franklin, you hear me?

01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:52.909
If you're gonna check out,
Aretha's not a bad way to go.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:55.328
'Course you're probably more
a Michael Bolton kind of guy.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.914
Don't shout.
You're making too much noise.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.958
- 'Bama, turn down the volume.
- Turn it down?

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:03.544
Turn it off. It's on a different
circuit. It's all right.

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:08.591
- My cat's in my apartment. Will it blow?
- Want to wait and find out?

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.886
Keep moving!
Everybody out of the building.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:15.681
Keep it down out there! We're trying
to concentrate. Can you believe them?

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:18.684
Think I prefer the music.
What about you guys? Turn it back on.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:21.745
Pretty brave for having a bomb
on your head.

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:26.233
Tell me something.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.653
Tony, why'd you leave SWAT?

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:31.364
Wasn't dangerous enough.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.033
And it's Anthony. Three syllables.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:38.162
You like to have it all
on the line, hmm?

01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:41.207
More light. Put your light in there.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.709
Is that why you joined disposal?

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:46.128
Everybody loves a hero, and I'm a hero.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:49.215
So there it is.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:53.928
You know what happens to heroes
in this outfit? They get blown away.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:58.849
Which wouldn't be so bad in your case.

01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:01.727
Problem is, they tend
to take other people with 'em.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:06.331
I guess we're one and the same,
you and me. Huh?

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:10.502
Fuck!

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:18.009
You ain't brave, asshole. You're dumb.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.724
- Have you ever seen one of these?
- No, but it's just two wires going in.

01:08:26.727 --> 01:08:30.214
One of them's gotta be the ground.
So cut it, right?

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.758
Right?

01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:35.219
- Hello?
- Nah, too easy.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:38.930
What's the problem? What's the problem?

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.157
We got ourselves another device.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.203
Enslaved. We cut one wire, they both go.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:48.149
I always wanted to go out with a bang.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:52.042
Either we shut 'em down at the same
instant or we don't collect hazard pay.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.214
Just the red wire, 'Bam.

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.510
Don't touch the other post.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.223
You ready?

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.482
Goddamn woofer.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:20.555
Connie read me my horoscope,
and it said...

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:23.241
I should be wary of big dogs.

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:28.453
You know, "woofer." Dog.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.027
- You believe this shit?
- Lieutenant?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:36.629
I have to be here. He doesn't.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.926
He's right, 'Bama.
We only need two sets of hands.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:52.770
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:01.863
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:05.283
It wasn't in the stars.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.995
Here you go.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:15.069
All right. All right.

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:18.046
Put a little tension on it.

01:10:19.089 --> 01:10:21.007
You're on the wire now.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.969
Take up the slack.
There you go. Hold it.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.890
Wait for me.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.148
You scared?

01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:40.652
Shitless.

01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:43.821
Good.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:49.410
You're right on it now.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:54.666
I'm waiting on you, Lieutenant.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.086
On one.

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:01.047
On one. Okay.

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:05.161
- Three.
- One, one.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.914
On the number one, hmm?

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:11.792
One.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:14.420
Three.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.505
Two.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:17.897
One.

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:26.197
We got it. We got it. Come on.
That's it, buddy. Come on.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:33.288
Gotcha.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:51.491
Lost a little altitude, did ya?
Here. Is this yours, honey?

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:06.214
- Who are you?
- Me? Just a kite fixer.

01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:20.061
Here. Hold it for me.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:23.147
Here. Can you hold it?

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.427
Aw, come on.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:31.989
Oh! You don't talk to strangers.
You're a very wise girl.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:42.083
- Do you have to cut it?
- Just the string, darling.

01:13:49.883 --> 01:13:51.926
Ah, does it hurt?

01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:55.122
Not really.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.390
You're a very kind girl.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:03.187
Lizzy?

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.694
Lizzy! Lizzy!

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:21.414
Lizzy, come here!

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.738
Elizabeth, get over here right now!

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:30.199
What, Mom? This man helped my kite.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.785
It caught on the fence. He cut his hand.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:35.887
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.

01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:41.126
It flies like a bird now.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:44.254
Say, you wouldn't happen to know where
the Lindstroms live?

01:14:44.354 --> 01:14:47.466
They're cooking up some crabs.
I'm kinda late.

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:53.779
I got hung up here
helping Lizzy with her kite. Lindstroms.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:58.519
Yeah, they're down the beach.
The third house on the left.

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:01.313
Third house on the left.

01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:03.247
Thank you.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.084
So long, darling.

01:15:18.722 --> 01:15:20.833
Mister, you forgot your bag.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.336
- Mister!
- Whoa! Watch it!

01:15:24.436 --> 01:15:28.523
- Don't put your hands in there!
- Don't touch that!

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.846
They taste better than they look.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.140
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws."

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.142
You are a pair of ragged claws.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:42.537
Why do you want to be so mean to me?
Because you're a pair of ragged claws."

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.857
- He's weird.
- Come on.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.987
Let's go get the kite.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.658
Here it is.

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:38.118
- Can we fix it and try again?
- We'll see.

01:16:38.218 --> 01:16:41.053
- Please?
- We'll try to fix it.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:47.252
When thinking of the men and women
who'd sacrifice life itself...

01:16:47.352 --> 01:16:49.922
my suffering seems insignificant.

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:52.049
No, no, no.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.260
Yes, we know you tried to stop
the bomb, Liam...

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.030
but isn't it true you helped
the mad bomber build it?

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.686
Answer the question. Yes or no?

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:08.232
When I built the bomb, I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:10.234
It was the mad bomber.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:14.154
Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men.
Make love not war. Yes, yes.

01:17:14.254 --> 01:17:18.382
It's a bit late for all of that.
The time is at hand.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.165
And you, Liam my boy...

01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:28.001
are the first begotten of the dead.

01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:30.128
It'll do you a lot of good
in the long run.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:32.730
I want my dad.

01:17:33.857 --> 01:17:36.802
He's not here, Liam. He's gone to war.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:40.430
- Oh, no!
- You'll have to be a big boy now.

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:45.435
Come, my little wretched refuse.
Let me dry your tears.

01:17:45.535 --> 01:17:48.397
Show us your face, Liam...

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.666
and I'll dry your tears.

01:17:58.423 --> 01:18:02.536
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:06.013
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here.

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:10.168
Get your hot dogs here.

01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:12.645
- Hot dogs.
- Hot dog.

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:15.606
Right here.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:21.221
What are you doing here?

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:24.266
Nice to see you again too, Boyle.
Give me a dog.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:27.368
Two mustards. I like mine spicy.

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.814
So, you still passing the hat?

01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:35.027
- Keeping the home front in hot potatoes?
- That'll be two bucks, O'Bannon.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:38.905
You wouldn't be feeding a wayward
brother with all that extra dough?

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:41.366
Just new here in town.

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:44.411
Wayward brother?
You been in the sun too long.

01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:46.872
His name's Ryan Gaerity.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.041
And if you've done him any favors...

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.878
you've done the cause a huge big harm.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:58.050
Since when have you been
so concerned about the cause, huh?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:03.013
I'm concerned about people's lives,
just like the good sisters taught me.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:05.990
But Gaerity is taking lives,
cops' lives.

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:10.562
Not to mention the Irishman
that he murdered...

01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:12.648
when he busted out of Castle Gleigh.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:16.151
Irishman? What Irishman?

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:18.669
Check it out, why don't ya?

01:19:19.796 --> 01:19:22.840
I'm out of mustard. I'll be back.

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:31.458
Here's your mustard.

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.418
He likes his Guinness.

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:36.380
- Be sure to give the bastard one for me.
- It'll be a pleasure.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.523
Hot dog! Come and get your hot dog!

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:52.437
Jimmy, what's up?

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:54.830
Oh, come in here.

01:19:55.999 --> 01:19:59.877
Listen to this. Not the voice
but what's behind it.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:04.574
When thinking of the men and women
who'd sacrifice life itself...

01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:07.661
my suffering seems insignificant.

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:10.831
- It's a foghorn.
- No, it's too soft.

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:15.643
I think it's a buoy. Listen.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:20.841
You're saying he's by the water?
The whole city's by the water.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:24.928
- There must be a thousand buoys.
- Not like this one.

01:20:25.028 --> 01:20:28.030
No. They use bells now, not horns.

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:35.731
Except the ones down along
the inner harbor, the old ones.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.749
Captain, get down here.
I think I got somethin'.

01:20:40.752 --> 01:20:43.613
I think we've got somethin' here.

01:20:43.713 --> 01:20:46.867
- What do you have, Lieutenant?
- Hmm?

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.745
How did you know
there were two triggers on my stereo?

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.497
I mean, that's pretty damn amazing,
even for you.

01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:57.544
And when the truck got blown to shit,
he called you then. Didn't he call you?

01:20:57.644 --> 01:21:01.465
- What are you thinking?
- You're the reason this is coming down.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:04.176
That's what I'm thinking. You tell me.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.986
- You're thinking too much.
- Bullshit!

01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:10.932
I'm wearing a B.D. uniform
just like you.

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.518
I'm a walking target
just like the rest of these guys.

01:21:13.618 --> 01:21:15.562
I just want to know the truth.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:17.689
Anthony, if you want to do
what's right for the squad...

01:21:17.789 --> 01:21:21.000
What's right for the squad,
or what's right for you? Huh?

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:25.280
You tell me something.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.909
Why did you join disposal, Dove?

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:32.219
What's up? Who's got what?

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.334
The lieutenant's got it all.
You should talk to him.

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.643
You should talk to him.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:46.317
- What's that about?
- He's feeling the pressure. Come here.

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:26.925
Know what you're looking for,
Lieutenant?

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.068
What are you, my shadow?

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:48.113
That's it, use the jab. Now, come on.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.907
Use that jab, you bastard. Up there.

01:22:51.007 --> 01:22:53.827
Downstairs. There you are.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.454
That's it. Come on. Come on!

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:58.456
Combination. Turn it over.

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:00.959
That's it! Come on now.

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:04.838
Just a little bit.
That's it. Keep them mitts up.

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:08.675
Barman, Guinness. Gimme a Guinness here.

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:10.385
You cocknut, Shamus!

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.762
Keep your goddamn mitts up!
Come on, Shamus.

01:23:12.862 --> 01:23:16.516
Our barman's got a bit
of the legal tender riding on this one.

01:23:16.616 --> 01:23:20.604
- Aye. Seems to be a sickness with him.
- You got a bit of Irish in that voice.

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.440
Did you grow up in the old country?

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.833
What makes you think I'm growed up?

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:30.071
I've been in this godforsaken land...

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:33.283
of bungee jumpin'
and McDLTs since I was 12.

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:35.744
Didn't like the way they talked.
No music to it.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.746
"May those who love us, love us.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.749
And those who don't love us,
may God turn their hearts."

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.751
"But if he can't turn their hearts...

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:47.563
may he turn their ankles
so we'll know them by their limping."

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:51.275
You're a good egg, Dad.

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.638
Francie! You're a mighty warrior,
but you need to bring us...

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.182
two pints for two poets.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:24:00.393
- Wake up, Francie.
- That's the way you get served here!

01:24:00.493 --> 01:24:02.327
Here. Allow me.

01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:07.082
Truly the nectar of the gods.

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:12.296
Too bad we can only rent it.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:23.390
Watch me beer for me, would ya?
Need to go choke the old snake.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.962
Watch your ankles, Dad!

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:28.479
Aye.

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:46.121
- Oh, shit!
- Watch yourself.

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:51.569
The Dolphin runs a crooked game, huh?

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:55.240
- Check that way. I'll check up here.
- I think I'll go with you.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.883
Just do it.

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:19.347
It's me, Jimmy.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.349
I got the bastard for ya.

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.977
- What? I thought...
- Hold your horses.

01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:26.312
Everything's under control. Listen.

01:25:26.412 --> 01:25:29.816
- I'm in the pisser at O'Dowell's Pub.
- Max, get out...

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:34.044
- Get your ass here as fast...
- I was watching your beer.

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:52.646
- You shouldn't have done that, Dad.
- Yeah? Well, fuck you, Dad!

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.552
- Where's the phone?
- Back in the men's room.

01:25:57.652 --> 01:26:00.904
What's going on? Fella!

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:06.827
- Get out.
- All right, I'm goin'!

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:42.448
- Max!
- Jimmy, is that you?

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:44.701
It's me.

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:49.747
I'd ask you to give me a spin,
but I'm scared to move.

01:27:49.847 --> 01:27:52.167
I'm ticking.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.685
Here. Give a look here.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:22.655
What's the prognosis?
Am I gonna be blown to kingdom come?

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:25.783
I'm going to my bike to get my tools.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:28.328
I don't mean to question your talents...

01:28:28.428 --> 01:28:31.748
but I'm pretty well buggered here,
wouldn't you say?

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:34.918
Max, you said it.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:37.629
I learned from this guy.
I'm gonna shut him down.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:39.339
By Christmas, maybe...

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:43.468
but if you tried to do it
in the wee bit of time left...

01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:46.012
there'd be two dead micks
under the tree...

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:49.807
- and Gaerity drinking champagne...
- Don't move.

01:28:49.907 --> 01:28:52.200
That includes your tongue.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.333
Aye, suppose it does.

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:46.880
Lord, forgive me.

01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:13.383
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:17.080
- You okay?
- Have you seen him?

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.972
Not since yesterday.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:22.058
Sorry about Max.

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:26.396
I don't know how
he got mixed up in this.

01:31:27.690 --> 01:31:30.233
He's not on the bomb squad.

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:34.654
Wait a minute.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:36.766
Liam McGivney.

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:39.811
"9/21/1954."

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:42.563
- Where'd you meet him?
- Who?

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:46.750
Your husband. Your husband.
Where'd you meet him?

01:31:49.086 --> 01:31:50.504
Church.

01:31:52.131 --> 01:31:55.091
Church. Church in town?
Somewhere in Boston?

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:59.205
I'll let you get back to work. Bye.

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:01.765
You really don't have to leave.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.951
"Max O'Bannon."

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.682
Hi.

01:32:59.782 --> 01:33:02.450
Jimmy, are you okay?

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:13.154
Max could never get the bubbles to work.

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:15.714
You thinking of checking out?

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:24.347
Taking the easy way out?

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:27.892
Talk to me!

01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:33.549
Come on. Answer me! Answer me, Jimmy!

01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:35.927
Fight! Fight!

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:40.989
How can I fight him if I can't find him?
Where is he? I'll fight him!

01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:46.020
What the hell are you doing here?
I told you to get away from me.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.205
Katie, you don't know this guy.

01:33:50.666 --> 01:33:53.376
You don't know me.
You don't know what I've done.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:09.627
No, I don't know what you've done...

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:14.189
but I do know you,
and you're not like him.

01:34:18.861 --> 01:34:21.071
I love you, Jimmy.

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:33.458
He was at the beach house.

01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:39.115
- He was... Katie, where are you going?
- The concert's tonight.

01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:42.676
- Katie!
- I'm not hiding anymore.

01:38:52.509 --> 01:38:56.080
A special live performance
of the "1812 Overture" on A&E...

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.139
with Fourth of July fireworks.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:06.317
You found us then, Liam.

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:09.836
And on your new country's birthday
as well!

01:40:18.887 --> 01:40:22.625
- You always made us laugh, Ryan.
- We had some good times, didn't we?

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:26.936
We did. You're not fun anymore.

01:40:30.774 --> 01:40:32.843
You got any weapons on you?

01:40:32.943 --> 01:40:37.306
Oh, no. No. Just this.

01:40:37.406 --> 01:40:41.560
Look. Now, are you going to blow
my brains out or shoot my finger off?

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:44.605
What do you think would be
the safest course of action?

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:48.692
- Think it over.
- Why don't you do it?

01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:50.861
I'm tired of war.
Go ahead. Take us both.

01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:53.629
No, it's not for us.
It's for your lovely wife.

01:40:55.591 --> 01:40:57.925
It could be her farewell performance.

01:40:59.094 --> 01:41:02.513
Now you'll be backing away from me
with that goddamn pistol.

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:06.418
You're chickenshit.

01:41:06.518 --> 01:41:09.088
There she is sawing away
on her fiddle...

01:41:09.188 --> 01:41:12.925
for 500,000 beautiful Americans
celebrating revolution.

01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:16.845
I'll bet little Lizzy is there as well.
She's waiting for the fireworks.

01:41:16.945 --> 01:41:20.224
Don't give me your political bullshit.
You're doing this out of revenge!

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:24.702
She's waiting for the rockets' red glare
and the bombs doing you know what.

01:41:31.835 --> 01:41:35.322
You might want to mind your feet.
Betty's a very particular girl.

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:38.049
I hate guns.

01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:43.846
You fell for it.
That wasn't the real trigger. This is.

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:55.843
The real fireworks for Katie
and Lizzy will be later.

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.928
So why don't you settle down with Betty.

01:41:58.028 --> 01:42:01.932
Maybe you'll catch it on the telly.
I wasn't expecting you so early.

01:42:02.032 --> 01:42:04.742
It's funny how things
always work out for the best.

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:23.344
You remember how much
we used to love to sing, Liam?

01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:33.422
Our fedders rent in twain

01:42:33.522 --> 01:42:36.717
And Ireland long a province

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:41.555
Be a nation once again

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:45.309
Down the hatch, Liam.
I'll be leaving you with my masterpiece.

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:50.621
I'd love to show you how it works,
but really there's no time.

01:42:54.793 --> 01:42:57.529
Ireland be a nation.

01:42:57.629 --> 01:43:00.840
Once again

01:44:28.637 --> 01:44:31.847
You bring your handcuffs, lad?

01:45:48.925 --> 01:45:50.968
Lieutenant? Lieutenant?

01:45:54.222 --> 01:45:56.432
- Come on, Tony!
- Watch out!

01:45:57.642 --> 01:45:59.435
Let's go!

01:46:00.896 --> 01:46:02.214
It's gonna blaze! Let's go!

01:46:02.314 --> 01:46:05.384
- What have you done with Katie?
- Let's go.

01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:09.137
We've gotta get to Katie!
Ryan, where is it?

01:46:09.237 --> 01:46:11.181
Where's the bomb?

01:46:11.281 --> 01:46:13.199
Forget it, man! It's too late!

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:17.620
We've gotta get to Katie!

01:46:27.422 --> 01:46:29.632
Give me your hand, Jimmy. Come on!

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:55.077
- Where's your car?
- What's going on?

01:47:55.177 --> 01:47:57.094
- Katie's in trouble.
- Where is she?

01:48:03.685 --> 01:48:06.880
Where are the fireworks?

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:09.565
Watch your mom. They'll be along soon.

01:48:19.242 --> 01:48:21.410
You said thanks, didn't ya?

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:26.415
- Thanks. Now we're even.
- I don't think so.

01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:37.801
Wow!

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.590
Come on!

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:53.859
- Can't this piece of shit go faster?
- Faster.

01:49:20.595 --> 01:49:22.888
Whoo! Wow!

01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:27.685
Oh, damn it! Come on, come on!

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.817
Police! Police!

01:49:38.321 --> 01:49:42.601
Police! Do you see her? Do you see her?

01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:45.270
I'm with the orchestra.
I'm right over there.

01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:47.939
Come on, Mom. Look how pretty they are.

01:49:48.039 --> 01:49:50.901
- Just hurry.
- I don't wanna go.

01:49:51.001 --> 01:49:54.169
- Come on, honey.
- It just started.

01:50:16.526 --> 01:50:18.485
Katie! Police!

01:50:23.658 --> 01:50:26.327
I'm bomb squad! Katie!

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:46.555
I need your bike! Bomb squad! Katie!

01:50:55.023 --> 01:50:58.134
Don't touch the brakes.
There's something in the car.

01:50:58.234 --> 01:50:59.678
What?

01:50:59.778 --> 01:51:03.640
Listen to me. Whatever you do,
don't put your foot on the brake.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.408
Take your foot off the gas
and downshift.

01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:11.231
- Do it!
- It doesn't work!

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.608
Oh, shit! All right.

01:51:13.708 --> 01:51:17.211
- What about the emergency?
- No. Don't touch anything.

01:51:42.153 --> 01:51:44.472
Hi, Lizzy. Tell you what.

01:51:44.572 --> 01:51:47.241
Why don't you get in the backseat?
Attagirl.

01:51:50.954 --> 01:51:53.315
Lizzy, put your seat belt on.

01:51:53.415 --> 01:51:55.666
Hi.

01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:19.424
Give me a break.

01:52:19.524 --> 01:52:21.150
- Now?
- No, not you!

01:52:43.715 --> 01:52:46.467
- Oh, no!
- Hold on!

01:52:51.139 --> 01:52:52.499
Stop!

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:55.335
- Jimmy, it's a dead end.
- Mom, put on your brakes.

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:58.187
If you're gonna do something, do it now.

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:01.091
Oh, shit!

01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:03.150
Now, hit it!

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:14.771
Let's get outta here! Come on. Get out.

01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:18.707
Let's get outta here. Come on.

01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:23.738
Get outta here now.
There's a bomb in the car!

01:53:23.838 --> 01:53:27.659
- Where's Kate?
- Clear the area! Get it marked off!

01:53:27.759 --> 01:53:30.511
Let's close this street off over here!

01:53:31.846 --> 01:53:35.166
- Where's Gaerity?
- It's okay. He's gone.

01:53:35.266 --> 01:53:37.585
- Where is he?
- It doesn't matter.

01:53:37.685 --> 01:53:40.630
You okay? You all right?

01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:43.065
Get back!

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:46.386
It's all right, sweetheart. It's okay.

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:52.058
Don't you ever get tired
of being a hero, Jimmy? I'm sorry.

01:53:52.158 --> 01:53:54.728
It's, ah, Liam.

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:58.064
- Right?
- What are you, a detective?

01:53:58.164 --> 01:54:02.292
I'm bomb squad.
The real question is who are you?

01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:11.802
I'll tell you what.
Here, you give this to Captain Roarke.

01:54:13.263 --> 01:54:16.624
Tell him whatever the hell
you wanna tell him.

01:54:16.724 --> 01:54:18.960
I gotta tell him the truth.

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:23.131
I gotta tell him...

01:54:23.231 --> 01:54:26.676
how I tracked the terrorist...

01:54:26.776 --> 01:54:28.887
I disarmed the bomb...

01:54:28.987 --> 01:54:31.639
and I saved the day.

01:54:31.739 --> 01:54:35.059
And I'm a hero!
And everybody loves a hero.

01:54:35.159 --> 01:54:38.521
So you just go back to your wife
and your kid...

01:54:38.621 --> 01:54:42.708
and you leave this here for us heroes.

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:50.591
It's not in your heart anymore,
is it, Jimmy?

01:54:57.473 --> 01:55:00.309
Job well done, Tony... Anthony.

01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:03.770
Thanks, man.

01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:09.636
Don't do that! Come on!

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:12.597
Get outta here!

01:55:12.697 --> 01:55:15.600
Let's close off this area.

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:18.201
Can't you people do anything without me?

01:55:22.957 --> 01:55:27.336
You okay? You're a hell of a driver!

01:55:29.005 --> 01:55:32.742
Come here, lizard. Gimme a kiss.

01:55:32.842 --> 01:55:34.536
Let's get outta here.

01:55:34.636 --> 01:55:37.247
- What happened to your leg?
- Nothing, sweetheart.

01:55:37.347 --> 01:55:39.749
- It's all bloody.
- Had a little trouble at work.

01:55:39.849 --> 01:55:44.186
- Let's get you fixed up.
- I thought we were going to "Compost."

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:47.940
Quepos.
