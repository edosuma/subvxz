  The question on the minds of
  the Bulldogs' sports fans is

00:04.738 --> 00:08.007
  can new quarterback sensation
     Bella "Awesome" Dawson

00:08.108 --> 00:10.142

      who said Kyle thinks
          you're cute!

00:38.204 --> 00:41.507

          Great speech
       in Social Studies.

01:06.866 --> 01:12.404

 - And Charlotte's locker which
     you know was not stuck.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.568

04:20.892 --> 04:23.729
   - For decades, the Bulldogs
     lost to the Stallions.

 Then five years ago a terrible
    drought struck our town.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.601
 To save water, the team didn't
        shower that week.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.571
   The football spirits looked
 kindly on our filthy sacrifice

04:32.672 --> 04:37.276

      the dance on Friday?

04:59.666 --> 05:02.334

     the boys just abandoned

16:34.927 --> 16:37.228
    five years of tradition?
            - Uh-huh.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.231
       - Really? The night
        before the game?

16:40.332 --> 16:41.299
            - Uh-huh.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.069
        - Bella, unh-unh.
        What's goin' on?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.071
 - I heard that Charlotte Newman
      was going to ask Kyle

16:47.172 --> 16:49.407
          to the dance,
      so I asked him first.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.908
             - Kyle?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.944
       You mean...Kyle...

16:53.045 --> 16:55.613
   - Yes, and I refuse to lose
     another chance with him

16:55.714 --> 16:59.117
 just for some ridiculous ritual
    that doesn't really work.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.719
 - Bella, when you and your dad

17:01.820 --> 17:04.155
wore your Cowboys jerseys inside
   out, it didn't always work,

17:04.256 --> 17:06.357
       but it brought you
        closer together.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.627
    Well, this ritual brings
  the Bulldogs closer together.

17:09.728 --> 17:13.364
   And they're your team now.
 It's something to think about.

        I can't...But...

18:14.526 --> 18:15.960
        - What she said.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.662
       You can't let Kyle
       see you like this.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.197
  Quick, I know how to shower.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.832
        You get the stuff
      from the girls' room,

18:20.933 --> 18:22.533
  I'll set off the sprinklers.

       - Guys, stop. Stop.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.837
         - I know I made
       the date with Kyle,

18:25.938 --> 18:28.106
     but I made a commitment
       to the team, first.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.174
        I may not believe
        in their ritual,

18:30.275 --> 18:31.976
     but I believe in them.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.778
       And if Kyle doesn't
           understand,

18:33.879 --> 18:36.747
      then it wasn't meant
          to be anyway.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.124

        if you wanted to

        my ride is here.
