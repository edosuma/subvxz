WEBVTT

00:04.670 --> 00:06.369
JESSI: How many logs
do you think we have?

00:06.405 --> 00:09.271
CHRIS: Um... we got
about a day's worth.

00:09.307 --> 00:11.439
JESSI: This is a lot.

00:11.475 --> 00:13.841
CHRIS: In town you gauge how
much fuel you're going through

00:13.876 --> 00:15.609
by the gallon.

00:15.644 --> 00:18.778
Out here we gauge it by how
many logs goes into the stove.

00:20.314 --> 00:23.914
And when it's cold we go
through about five logs

00:23.950 --> 00:25.449
every two hours.

00:25.484 --> 00:28.451
I mean, it's just
a constant battle.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.920
JESSI: In the past it's been
just kinda surviving out here.

00:33.823 --> 00:36.723
Making sure that we have
just enough for each day

00:36.758 --> 00:38.691
and for each week.

00:38.726 --> 00:42.027
But I don't want
to just make it by.

00:42.062 --> 00:45.329
I want to be prepared.

00:46.532 --> 00:50.566
Does anybody else
anywhere go through this
much stinking wood a day?

00:50.601 --> 00:53.501
CHRIS: Ha.
JESSI: You know what I mean?

00:53.536 --> 00:55.902
This is over a
quarter of our time.

00:55.938 --> 00:57.437
CHRIS: I don't like
when you put it like that.

00:57.472 --> 00:59.471
JESSI: Well, just
trying to be real.

00:59.507 --> 01:05.175
Maybe we should, like,
really try to winterize
the house, like, fully.

01:05.211 --> 01:08.211
Instead of just
band-aiding all of the holes.

01:08.246 --> 01:11.246
Like, it's gonna start
getting seriously cold.

01:11.281 --> 01:12.914
I can see all the
holes through the wall,

01:12.949 --> 01:15.849
and it feels like I
have a, a cold fan.

01:15.884 --> 01:17.517
CHRIS: Yeah.

01:17.552 --> 01:20.252
JESSI: If we wanna take care
of that we may only have like

01:20.287 --> 01:24.622
the next two days until the
most dangerous and worst part

01:24.657 --> 01:27.557
of winter is here.

01:31.061 --> 01:33.327
<i>NARRATOR: Isolated 100</i>
<i>miles from Fairbanks,</i>

01:33.363 --> 01:36.930
<i>Chris and Jessi rely on the</i>
<i>tedious task of chopping wood</i>

01:36.965 --> 01:38.798

01:38.833 --> 01:40.932

01:40.968 --> 01:43.334

01:46.605 --> 01:49.038
CHRIS: So, take a
pause and winterize?

01:49.073 --> 01:52.540
JESSI: Absolutely.
It might make a difference.

01:52.576 --> 01:55.409
Especially as it
gets 40 and 50 below.

01:55.444 --> 01:57.010
CHRIS: My leg has
already been killing me.

01:57.045 --> 01:58.911
And you're right.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.880
JESSI: This is a big deal.

02:01.915 --> 02:04.348
We really need to
encase this place.

02:04.383 --> 02:06.283
Cut down on our heat loss.

02:06.318 --> 02:08.284
And if we don't do it now,
we're never gonna get a chance

02:08.319 --> 02:10.752
for the rest of the winter.

02:10.788 --> 02:14.488
All right.
Winterizing will be happening.

02:18.826 --> 02:20.959
MICHAEL: It doesn't
matter if it's day, night,

02:20.994 --> 02:25.696
20 below, 20 above,
windy, not windy.

02:26.865 --> 02:28.431
Work doesn't stop.

02:28.466 --> 02:31.199
You gotta keep going.
You gotta keep pushing.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.874
Ugh! Bam!

02:42.909 --> 02:44.975
Another slab down.

02:47.879 --> 02:49.445
So here it is.

02:49.480 --> 02:53.481
It's not the beginnings
and the origins of a
hoarder's lifestyle.

02:53.516 --> 02:56.316
This is the spot where
I'm gonna put all these

02:56.351 --> 02:59.218
cabin kit pieces up.

02:59.253 --> 03:01.386
It might not look like much,
but this is gonna be

03:01.421 --> 03:03.554
a two-story building.

03:04.223 --> 03:06.923
It's not gonna look pretty,
but it's gonna be a nice cozy

03:06.958 --> 03:09.692
place to call home.

03:09.727 --> 03:12.360
<i>NARRATOR: Building a cabin</i>
<i>from recently repurposed parts</i>

03:12.395 --> 03:15.796

03:31.241 --> 03:32.373
MICHAEL: All right.

03:32.409 --> 03:35.175
These boards, I'm just gonna
nail 'em both together and

03:35.211 --> 03:39.912
make nice strong
support beams for my floor.

03:40.247 --> 03:44.181
And then this 16 by 18 deck
will get flopped down on these

03:44.217 --> 03:47.317
and these will
be the backbone.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.385
Snap a chalk line, and I start
buzzing these into boards that

03:50.420 --> 03:53.154
I could actually use.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.589
So, I could just go to a
box store and buy lumber,

03:56.625 --> 03:59.692
but I wouldn't have the
satisfaction and the pride of

03:59.727 --> 04:02.794
putting in that hard work
and make my own stuff.

04:05.030 --> 04:08.531
I'm actually gonna
set the corner of this
cabin on this stump.

04:08.566 --> 04:09.965
I mean, why not?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.467
It's not like it's gonna go
anywhere in the next decade.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.777
(breathing heavily).

04:27.812 --> 04:30.012
Damn.

04:38.186 --> 04:40.085
When I'm working
on stuff like this,

04:40.120 --> 04:43.254
I think of all the men and
women I served with in the

04:43.289 --> 04:46.289
United States Army.

04:46.325 --> 04:50.826
It was just crazy dangerous,
crazy stressful,

04:50.861 --> 04:54.561
and together we built
stuff all over Iraq.

04:54.597 --> 04:59.365
Whether it was building bridge
across the Tigris River or

04:59.400 --> 05:03.768
building mortar-resistant
living quarters for
special operations.

05:05.004 --> 05:08.504
This project here is a
reminder of how we were trained.

05:08.539 --> 05:10.906
We weren't trained to be
perfectionists that have

05:10.941 --> 05:12.907
time on our hands.

05:12.942 --> 05:17.043
We kicked ass, and we
got the mission done.

05:21.181 --> 05:23.314
Whoo! Perfect time
to run outta nails.

05:23.349 --> 05:24.815
Done!

05:24.850 --> 05:26.850
This is what you get when
you're not a perfectionist.

05:26.885 --> 05:29.385
You just get stuff done.

05:33.990 --> 05:36.223
ALEX: Before I came out here
I had very little experience,

05:36.258 --> 05:39.391
but I did know the
seriousness of winter
way up here in the north.

05:39.427 --> 05:42.026
If I don't stay
ahead of the game,

05:42.062 --> 05:46.029
I'll either have to run
outta here or just die.

05:46.064 --> 05:48.798
You know, those are
pretty much the two choices.

05:51.668 --> 05:54.201
It's really becoming
apparent that the days
are coming shorter.

05:54.237 --> 05:57.537
The temperature's
dropped down a lot.

05:57.572 --> 05:59.905
Come on, Sipsey, let's go.

06:00.541 --> 06:02.640
I still don't have everything
stockpiled as much as I want

06:02.675 --> 06:06.076
to be ready for winter,
because winter here in Alaska

06:06.111 --> 06:08.577
is nine months.

06:08.613 --> 06:11.913
Nine months of cold and dark.

06:11.948 --> 06:15.182
It's not something you can
just huddle up and wait out.

06:17.285 --> 06:19.718
Today is water day.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.786
I have to get water
about once a month or so.

06:21.822 --> 06:23.687
Depending on how much I haul.

06:23.723 --> 06:25.255
It's a pretty tough slog.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.156
Just suck it in.

06:27.192 --> 06:28.958
Okay.

06:28.993 --> 06:32.727
But it's gonna be even
longer today because
my good water spot,

06:32.762 --> 06:36.096
if the water table's gone too
low I can't use it anymore.

06:36.131 --> 06:38.964
Sipsey! Hey.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.699
So that means I gotta go a
little further to the spring

06:41.735 --> 06:44.435
that is still
running down there.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.269
I grew up just
like most people,

06:46.305 --> 06:48.404
you turn on a faucet
and water comes out.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.605
But here I don't have
anything like that.

06:50.641 --> 06:52.507
I've been drinking all of
my water through a filter or

06:52.542 --> 06:56.042
boiling it,
which kinda gets old.

06:56.078 --> 06:58.044
Come on, buddy.

06:58.079 --> 07:01.313
You know water is
one of the essential
building blocks of life.

07:01.348 --> 07:04.515
It's not something I
wanna screw around with.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.816
If I scoop water
right outta here,

07:05.851 --> 07:09.451
then it's not necessarily safe
to drink because there's all

07:09.487 --> 07:11.219
sorts of stuff in it.

07:11.254 --> 07:13.621
And melting snow
isn't really practical.

07:13.656 --> 07:15.589
It's something you could
do in a survival situation,

07:15.624 --> 07:17.757
but for day to day living I
have to fill up ten gallons of

07:17.792 --> 07:20.725
snow to get one
gallon of water.

07:22.862 --> 07:25.128
Simple stuff like getting
firewood and getting water,

07:25.164 --> 07:27.663
I would classify
those as a danger,

07:27.699 --> 07:30.932
because if I don't do those
things then I'll be getting in

07:30.968 --> 07:34.701
trouble real quick.

07:35.871 --> 07:38.270
Taking a risk at
dying out here.

07:42.942 --> 07:46.910
BRITTANY: Wherever you live,
you always have to have a
backup plan.

07:46.945 --> 07:50.879
When you live more remote you
have to have a backup plan

07:50.948 --> 07:53.681
for the backup plan.

07:59.086 --> 08:00.352
Do you know what
we're building?

08:00.387 --> 08:03.154
ELOVIE: No.
BRITTANY: No?

08:04.490 --> 08:08.624
We're going to build
an outdoor brick oven.

08:08.659 --> 08:12.894
So we have to go on a scavenger
hunt to try and find bricks.

08:13.830 --> 08:17.430
In order to cook anything,
we use propane.

08:17.465 --> 08:19.531
Occasionally, we do run out.

08:19.567 --> 08:24.735
I want an option that uses
materials that we always have,

08:24.770 --> 08:27.403
which is wood.

08:30.507 --> 08:35.208
So, McCarthy is an old mining
town that is closed down,

08:35.244 --> 08:39.978
and I remembered earlier this
summer seeing leftover bricks.

08:40.014 --> 08:42.513
Okay, kids.

08:43.583 --> 08:45.749
Maybe there are some
bricks in all this junk?

08:48.286 --> 08:49.818
BRITTANY: There's
no ice cream here.

08:49.854 --> 08:51.686
ELOVIE: Why?

08:53.756 --> 08:56.356
BRITTANY: What?
You found some?

08:56.391 --> 08:59.158
Oh, that's plenty.

08:59.193 --> 09:01.226
What do you think
these were used for?

09:01.261 --> 09:02.693
ELOVIE: I don't know.

09:03.329 --> 09:08.230
BRITTANY: Maybe in the
old time they were used for

09:08.266 --> 09:10.232
building chimneys out here.

09:12.002 --> 09:14.034
BRITTANY: Yeah. Ugh!

09:14.070 --> 09:17.870
You two, can you dust all
the snow off and I'll go
get the snow machine?

09:20.007 --> 09:21.839
BRITTANY: That's
how much I get. Okay.

09:28.146 --> 09:31.046
BRITTANY: Living so far away
from town it's sometimes hard

09:31.081 --> 09:34.048
to keep certain
things in stock.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.749
And I have to
think about my kids.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.351
Especially if the
weather is bad.

09:39.387 --> 09:43.954
We have to have a certain
level of self-reliance.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.422
Whoo!

09:49.060 --> 09:50.759
BRITTANY: Yup.

09:50.794 --> 09:54.328
This is definitely Home Ec,
McCarthy, Alaska style

09:54.363 --> 09:57.730
and I think that'll serve
my kids as they grow.

09:57.765 --> 10:01.499
We're at about 30.
We need 20 more.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.403
BRITTANY: Wow!

10:09.707 --> 10:11.873
CHRIS: Some people think that
we're crazy out here because

10:11.908 --> 10:15.775
it's so cold and it's so
harsh but the Cosna's a
lot like a relationship.

10:15.811 --> 10:18.310
There's give and take.

10:18.379 --> 10:20.212
If you don't
give to the Cosna,

10:20.247 --> 10:22.780
she's gonna take
everything from you.

10:28.786 --> 10:31.419
JESSI: Starting
to really ice up.

10:31.455 --> 10:32.954
Getting pretty thick.

10:32.989 --> 10:35.022
CHRIS: Yeah,
especially on this side.

10:35.057 --> 10:37.523
I can see where it's all
melting from the heat inside

10:37.559 --> 10:40.425
escaping, and this ice dam
right across the center,

10:40.461 --> 10:42.160
that's the worst of it.

10:42.195 --> 10:44.061
So, if we can do something
about even that area it's

10:44.096 --> 10:46.596
gonna help a lot.

10:48.699 --> 10:52.200
JESSI: What's happening is that
the heat is hitting our roof and

10:52.235 --> 10:55.102
it's melting all of that
snow and that builds up.

10:55.137 --> 10:56.436
Ooh.

10:56.471 --> 10:58.437
CHRIS: Ooh, that's solid.

10:58.473 --> 11:01.539
JESSI: Creating a really thick
ice dam that melts down the

11:01.575 --> 11:03.774
whole side of our house.

11:03.809 --> 11:05.142
CHRIS: It's cracking.

11:05.177 --> 11:07.577
JESSI: Yeah, the water
is actually flowing
underneath the ice.

11:07.612 --> 11:10.212
So in the deep winter you can
actually see ice forming on

11:10.247 --> 11:14.815
the walls inside and it's
just weakening our house,

11:14.850 --> 11:16.916
decaying those logs.

11:16.952 --> 11:19.018
This is a big problem.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.552
CHRIS: Real easy. Yeah!

11:20.587 --> 11:22.553
JESSI: Ooh.
CHRIS: All right!

11:24.957 --> 11:28.290
I think we're gonna be
able to get some of this off.

11:28.326 --> 11:29.458
Whoa!

11:29.493 --> 11:30.759
JESSI: Yeah.

11:30.794 --> 11:32.527
CHRIS: Can you
hand me the shovel?

11:32.562 --> 11:34.161
The roof out here
is really sketch.

11:34.196 --> 11:37.296
It's only held up
by two-by-fours and
they're on their sides.

11:37.332 --> 11:41.466
And if I step where
the two-by-fours aren't,

11:41.501 --> 11:44.134
I'm going through my tin.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.769
JESSI: Try to be
careful about where you
put your feet, yeah?

11:45.804 --> 11:47.403
CHRIS: Yeah.

11:47.438 --> 11:50.672
My dad's always like,
"Don't go on the roof!

11:50.707 --> 11:52.707
If you go up there, go
up there with snowshoes."

11:52.742 --> 11:54.841
You got it, dad.

11:55.544 --> 11:57.910
I'm just gonna go
real slow, real easy,

11:57.945 --> 12:00.412
and just try to do my best
to get the ice off without

12:00.447 --> 12:02.246
damaging the roof.

12:02.282 --> 12:05.248
Whoo!
This roof is a little funky.

12:05.284 --> 12:06.749
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:06.785 --> 12:08.084
It's slick!

12:08.119 --> 12:10.352
The last thing I wanna do is
be replacing roof panels in

12:10.387 --> 12:12.286
the middle of the winter.

12:14.290 --> 12:18.491
All right.
I can use that ice pick.

12:19.426 --> 12:22.193
If you can hand that up to me.

12:22.228 --> 12:24.028
Woo-hoo. Whoo!

12:26.331 --> 12:27.930
All right.

12:27.965 --> 12:30.932
I'm gonna sit down because I
am sliding all over the place.

12:30.967 --> 12:35.202
Let's just see if this will.

12:35.237 --> 12:38.004
JESSI: Be easy
with the screws.

12:38.039 --> 12:39.671
CHRIS: Ooh, the tin.

12:39.707 --> 12:41.472
JESSI: Did you cut it?

12:41.508 --> 12:44.841
CHRIS: No, it's just
really flexible down he...

12:45.877 --> 12:48.611
JESSI: Did you cut through it?

12:48.646 --> 12:52.346
CHRIS: No, I just, it's like a
tin can popping back and forth.

12:52.382 --> 12:54.481
Just really trying not to.

12:54.517 --> 12:56.216
JESSI: Hold on! Stop! Stop!

13:04.857 --> 13:07.590
JESSI: Hold on! Stop! Stop!

13:07.625 --> 13:08.624
All right.

13:08.659 --> 13:10.025
CHRIS: Perfect.
JESSI: Not quite.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.826
CHRIS: Hang on! Hang on!
You got it?

13:11.861 --> 13:14.494
I'm gonna break off this tip.

13:14.530 --> 13:16.829
Here we go.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.599
JESSI: Ugh!
Fudge buckets!

13:20.634 --> 13:22.500
CHRIS: You okay?
JESSI: Yup!

13:22.535 --> 13:24.168
CHRIS: Okay, stuff just
directly above you head is

13:24.203 --> 13:25.235
about to fall.

13:25.270 --> 13:26.036
All this is loose.

13:26.071 --> 13:27.570
JESSI: We lost our water.

13:27.605 --> 13:28.804
CHRIS: Gutter?
JESSI: Yeah.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.539
CHRIS: They're easy to put up.
JESSI: It's okay.

13:32.609 --> 13:35.042
CHRIS: All right, watch out.

13:35.077 --> 13:36.442
JESSI: You can prop
it up a little bit.

13:36.478 --> 13:38.277
CHRIS: Yeah, but
I got screws in.

13:38.312 --> 13:39.678
JESSI: Oh, you got it! Nice.

13:39.713 --> 13:40.979
CHRIS: Huh!

13:41.014 --> 13:44.448
If I had waited a
couple more days this
would not have come off.

13:46.118 --> 13:51.186
Easy there. Nice.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.354
I think we got the
ice off the roof.

13:53.389 --> 13:55.355
JESSI: Can you
get back over here?

13:55.390 --> 13:56.756
CHRIS: Yeah.

13:56.791 --> 13:58.390
I know it doesn't
look like much,

13:58.426 --> 14:00.825
but this is huge in my book.

14:00.861 --> 14:02.760
In all the years I've been out
here I've never been able to

14:02.795 --> 14:04.828
knock this ice off the roof.

14:04.863 --> 14:08.697
Whoa! God, it's slick. Okay.

14:08.733 --> 14:09.965
JESSI: Watch your step.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.466
CHRIS: Okay.
Step on the screws.

14:12.502 --> 14:13.734
Here I come.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.635
Now, if we can only get
the roof inside so it's not

14:15.671 --> 14:19.471
leaking air, then we
might actually have fixed it.

14:23.909 --> 14:25.408
ALEX: I like to throw
myself into situations where

14:25.444 --> 14:29.978
necessity compels me
to adapt and work.

14:30.013 --> 14:33.247
And so that's why I
kinda just threw myself
headfirst into this.

14:33.282 --> 14:35.915
Those are the kind
of situations I like.

14:45.691 --> 14:46.823
All right.

14:46.858 --> 14:48.090
This is another spring.

14:48.126 --> 14:50.292
The water's safe to drink.

14:50.327 --> 14:53.661
But if I wanna fill it quickly
it's kind of impossible,

14:53.696 --> 14:56.495
because there's not room.

14:56.498 --> 14:58.697
I can only dip the
bucket in that far.

14:58.733 --> 15:02.166
And also every time I dip it
stirs up dirt which is not

15:02.202 --> 15:03.367
what I wanna drink.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.435
Hey, Sipsey.

15:05.470 --> 15:08.270
This needs to dig
this down a lot deeper.

15:08.306 --> 15:09.805
I don't know how
long this will take.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.573
It kinda depends on
how soft the ground is.

15:13.843 --> 15:15.308
Yeah.

15:15.344 --> 15:17.176
So, all this ground is frozen.

15:17.212 --> 15:19.011
I won't be able to dig
that with my shovel,

15:19.046 --> 15:21.379
if I can't break it
with a heavy iron bar.

15:21.414 --> 15:23.147
So I need to thaw out this
ground just so I can kinda

15:23.182 --> 15:24.681
scoop it all away.

15:24.717 --> 15:27.216
And then I'll go around and
try to find more big rocks

15:27.252 --> 15:30.152
like this which I can
just collect from
the area around here.

15:30.187 --> 15:32.420
Start digging, put
in the big rocks,

15:32.455 --> 15:34.988
and that's it.

15:35.023 --> 15:36.556
Most of the time
when I work out here,

15:36.591 --> 15:39.024
it's either to address some
kind of immediate danger,

15:39.059 --> 15:43.961
or to make my day-to-day life
a little more comfortable.

15:44.663 --> 15:46.829
I'm gonna make a
fire underneath here.

15:46.865 --> 15:48.364
If the fire warms
up the snow above,

15:48.399 --> 15:51.332
the snow will drop on it
and then kill the fire, so.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.468
I get it out the way
before I make the fire.

15:55.504 --> 15:57.470
Okay.

15:57.505 --> 15:59.071
My hands are like numb
right now so I'm kinda,

15:59.106 --> 16:02.740
kinda eager to get
this fire going.

16:03.476 --> 16:04.741
It's never easy.

16:04.777 --> 16:07.777
You can never go
on auto pilot.

16:07.812 --> 16:10.679
You always gotta keep working.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.783
Feel warmer already.

16:17.952 --> 16:19.851
Oh, that's nice.

16:19.887 --> 16:22.253
Okay.

16:22.288 --> 16:24.454
I've been up here for,
you know,

16:24.490 --> 16:26.256
quite a few years already.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.124
People say, "Oh, it must take a
lot of heart to live up there,"

16:29.160 --> 16:32.493
and yeah, maybe
you gotta have some heart,

16:32.528 --> 16:35.295
but mostly it takes ass.

16:35.831 --> 16:38.264
And what I mean is it
takes a lot of (bleep) work.

16:38.299 --> 16:40.665
Basically, my work to survive
through the winter doesn't

16:40.701 --> 16:43.567
really end until
winter's over.

16:43.602 --> 16:47.036
This should be
enough to get started.

16:48.005 --> 16:51.472
Okay.
See if the fire did its job.

16:51.508 --> 16:52.840
Oh, yeah.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.442
Yeah, it's real soft.

16:55.477 --> 16:57.376
Cool.

16:57.412 --> 16:59.978
Now I can dig that
ground out a little easier.

17:00.013 --> 17:02.013
A lot easier, actually.

17:02.048 --> 17:03.947
Should be straight forward.

17:03.983 --> 17:05.448
It's just kind
of wet cold work,

17:05.484 --> 17:08.617
so I'm just trying to get
this done before sunset.

17:16.057 --> 17:17.356
MICHAEL: You want freedom?

17:17.392 --> 17:19.458
You're gonna be doing 60
to 80-hour weeks out here.

17:19.493 --> 17:21.359
There's no way around it.

17:21.394 --> 17:23.927
This is a lot
harder way of living,

17:23.963 --> 17:26.196
but I have
something to show for it.

17:26.231 --> 17:28.864
I have a, a story to tell.

17:35.404 --> 17:37.403
One, two, three.

17:38.206 --> 17:41.039
One, two, three.

17:42.442 --> 17:45.608
I'll be really happy
when these first-floor
deck pieces are in place.

17:45.644 --> 17:47.943
They're really heavy,
they're really awkward.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.445
Here it goes.

17:52.982 --> 17:55.715
It slows you down
working by yourself.

17:55.751 --> 18:02.053
No building project is ever
as easy as you may envision.

18:02.588 --> 18:03.654
Whoo!

18:03.689 --> 18:07.356
No build project is ever
as quick as you envision.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.960
When it's wintertime you may
as well just tack on another

18:13.029 --> 18:16.329
40 to 50% onto
your build time.

18:16.364 --> 18:19.364
It makes me wonder why the
heck I'm doing this when new

18:19.400 --> 18:21.966
construction would be a
lot easier to deal with,

18:22.001 --> 18:24.634
but I added up the cost
of a structure like this,

18:24.670 --> 18:28.570
it would have been about
$12,000 to put this together

18:28.606 --> 18:32.907
had I not reclaimed a building
and milled up my own lumber.

18:34.877 --> 18:37.510
Like a glove.

18:41.981 --> 18:43.447
Now what's going on here?

18:43.482 --> 18:45.849
Let me get a
measurement on this deck.

18:45.884 --> 18:50.118
I planned for a 16-by-18 deck.

18:50.153 --> 18:54.721
That's a 20-foot-long deck,
and so that's not gonna work.

18:56.324 --> 18:58.123
Son of a (bleep).

19:07.565 --> 19:08.897
That's not gonna work.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.833
(bleep) son of a (bleep).

19:11.868 --> 19:13.801
You make little
mistakes like that.

19:13.836 --> 19:17.303
And so, the support deck
is not quite big enough.

19:17.338 --> 19:20.272
I just need about
three feet more.

19:22.075 --> 19:25.442
And so, all I have to do is
build a little extension and

19:25.477 --> 19:29.344
set a support in place and
that'll help with strength.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.746
Make it nice and strong.

19:31.781 --> 19:33.147
Do I look like a
perfectionist?

19:33.182 --> 19:35.148
Heck, no!

19:35.183 --> 19:37.550
I look like somebody who
wants to get something done.

19:38.752 --> 19:40.785
(dogs howling).

19:40.821 --> 19:42.386
My dogs are noisy today.

19:42.422 --> 19:47.423
(howling, dogs barking).

19:47.458 --> 19:49.358
Have to make sure to
hang out with my dogs.

19:49.393 --> 19:50.558
I've been neglecting them.

19:50.594 --> 19:51.726
They're sad.

19:51.761 --> 19:54.428
Nobody's up there.

19:59.366 --> 20:03.400
(grunting).

20:03.436 --> 20:08.203
I can't wait to get all of
this stuff up before the real

20:08.239 --> 20:13.307
cold, cold spells, the 40
and 50 below stuff kicks in.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.275
Whoo!

20:15.310 --> 20:17.610
And if I get a real bad storm
while the structure of this

20:17.645 --> 20:20.845
isn't sound, it could
cave in under the snow.

20:23.349 --> 20:25.682
All right, that
was trouble-free.

20:25.717 --> 20:28.150
That never happens.

20:32.855 --> 20:36.222
BRITTANY: Living here, it
might not be exactly what you

20:36.257 --> 20:40.425
want it to be, but you have
to learn to adapt or die.

20:41.995 --> 20:45.662
This is the way that we're
embracing living out here.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.599
Okay, little monkeys.

20:51.634 --> 20:54.734
We're building an
outdoor brick oven.

20:54.770 --> 20:57.903
We have to lay a base first.

20:57.939 --> 21:02.907
We need it to be not
quite as cock-eyed.

21:04.776 --> 21:07.910
The temperatures have definitely
been in the negatives,

21:07.945 --> 21:11.579
so we have to move around,
get warm and keep going.

21:11.614 --> 21:14.581
That's better.

21:14.616 --> 21:18.550
Living in rural Alaska has
definitely toughened me up.

21:19.786 --> 21:23.520
It's made me adapt to
things that I just,

21:23.556 --> 21:26.656
I never thought
that I would adapt to.

21:26.691 --> 21:29.724
Oh, man.
Who needs CrossFit?

21:31.261 --> 21:33.594
BRITTANY: When you
can just build an oven.

21:33.629 --> 21:38.297
CrossFit is a type of
exercise that people do
to torture themselves.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.698
BRITTANY: Yeah.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.467
BRITTANY: It means
they sweat a lot.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.368
And they grunt a lot.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.937
(laughing).

21:47.972 --> 21:50.171
Okay.

21:50.207 --> 21:52.806
Stick these where
the holes are down.

21:52.842 --> 21:54.674
ELOVIE: Why?

21:54.710 --> 21:56.642
BRITTANY: So that the air
doesn't go through them.

21:56.678 --> 21:58.444
Ellie, you gonna get more?

22:00.747 --> 22:02.113
BRITTANY: You're
just gonna get one?

22:02.148 --> 22:03.347
ELOVIE: Yeah.

22:03.382 --> 22:05.715
BRITTANY: Well, how about
you put 10 in there instead?

22:07.652 --> 22:10.552
Out here we have a set of
skills that we need to know

22:10.587 --> 22:12.186
how to do.

22:12.221 --> 22:15.822
It's necessary for us
to learn these skills
in order to survive.

22:18.726 --> 22:21.993
So anti-climactic.

22:22.028 --> 22:23.360
But it worked.

22:23.396 --> 22:25.361
Okay.

22:25.397 --> 22:30.432
The cheapest way to get angle
iron is to get an old bed frame

22:30.467 --> 22:32.766
so that I can make a roof.

22:32.802 --> 22:34.434
Bring 'em over here.

22:34.470 --> 22:37.570
For my little oven here.

22:37.605 --> 22:41.639
A more structurally
sound brick oven.

22:42.442 --> 22:48.243
All right, I'm going to put a
couple of these bricks here.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.578
ELOVIE: Mom, we almost done.

22:50.614 --> 22:52.780
BRITTANY: We are almost done.

22:52.815 --> 22:55.248
Look at that.
Look in there.

22:55.283 --> 22:56.582
Tell me what you think.

22:56.618 --> 22:59.818
ELOVIE: Lovely.
BRITTANY: Lovely?

23:01.187 --> 23:05.655
Let's get some wood
and light this baby up.

23:05.690 --> 23:08.890
ELOVIE: Light this baby up?

23:08.926 --> 23:11.059
BRITTANY: That's a
figure of speech, sweetie.

23:15.297 --> 23:17.063
ALEX: You know, you get used
to things being easy or you

23:17.098 --> 23:18.931
get used to having
things your way,

23:18.966 --> 23:20.999
it kinda spoils you.

23:21.034 --> 23:23.300
On a regular basis when you're
reminded that you're gonna die,

23:23.335 --> 23:27.703
it helps keep you from,
I don't know,

23:27.738 --> 23:30.305
losing sight of
the big picture.

23:34.343 --> 23:37.443
It's definitely a, a lot of
hard work digging through this.

23:41.448 --> 23:43.547
Yeah, you can see there.

23:43.582 --> 23:46.682
I dig down a bit and
probably just as much
fills right back in.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.684
So, just gotta
keep at it, really.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.419
Just keep digging,
digging, digging, digging.

23:52.455 --> 23:54.988
Put in the work.

23:55.023 --> 23:56.689
You know it's kinda like when
you go camping, they say,

23:56.724 --> 23:58.290
"Ten minutes spent
kinda making your bed

23:58.325 --> 24:00.925
will equal hours of sleep."

24:00.961 --> 24:02.860
Every single time I come to
get water in the future this

24:02.895 --> 24:06.162
will pay me back in
hours of convenience.

24:06.197 --> 24:09.297
That's probably wide enough.

24:11.901 --> 24:15.468
Think that rock
weighed 100 pounds.

24:15.504 --> 24:18.837
The way I'm using the rocks is
kinda building a ring around

24:18.872 --> 24:22.773
to keep the dirt
from going in.

24:23.909 --> 24:26.209
And I'm also placing them in
the bottom which means when

24:26.244 --> 24:29.211
I scoop in there, I won't stir
up dirt and those will also

24:29.246 --> 24:33.013
hold the outer
ones from coming in.

24:34.983 --> 24:37.116
If I can kinda
make a dam here,

24:37.151 --> 24:39.551
that will allow
me to get a, ooh!

24:39.586 --> 24:41.586
(bleep), deeper scoop.

24:41.621 --> 24:43.520
Whoo!

24:43.556 --> 24:46.389
Went a little too deep.

24:46.424 --> 24:49.758
Just got a little
water in there.

24:49.793 --> 24:53.927
Everything is a pain
in the ass with gloves.

24:57.865 --> 25:00.298
I don't know how
much water is in here.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.366
Maybe there's 10,000
years' worth of water in here.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.435
Maybe there's 100
years' worth of water here.

25:05.470 --> 25:08.537
But I think this is the
best the waterhole's been.

25:10.107 --> 25:11.639
If you wanna get water like
that at the store you gotta

25:11.674 --> 25:14.407
pay a lot of money,
and then it always ends up

25:14.443 --> 25:17.409
tasting like plastic, anyway.

25:20.514 --> 25:22.813
Okay, that's my last jug.

25:22.848 --> 25:25.948
Thanks for the help, Sipsey.

25:26.551 --> 25:28.183
Hauling water is probably
one of the most physically

25:28.219 --> 25:30.318
demanding things I do.

25:30.353 --> 25:32.720
Okay.

25:32.755 --> 25:35.722
I wanna go back as fast as
I can 'cause even though it

25:35.790 --> 25:38.690
doesn't look like a lot,
it's a pretty arduous slog,

25:38.726 --> 25:40.758
slightly uphill the whole way.

25:40.794 --> 25:42.493
Sips!

25:42.528 --> 25:46.229
Dragging dead
weight through the snow.

25:48.632 --> 25:51.432
Okay, that's pretty bright.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.967
I can't see out
my glasses anyway.

25:54.870 --> 25:56.469
It's getting pretty dark.

25:56.504 --> 25:59.137
I don't know how cold it is or
how much further I have to go

25:59.173 --> 26:03.473
really but, uh, I am a
good ways from my cabin.

26:03.509 --> 26:05.441
My back's pretty tired.

26:05.477 --> 26:07.543
Getting cold fingers,
cold toes.

26:07.578 --> 26:10.378
Just awful, especially
carrying 200 pounds of water

26:10.413 --> 26:13.747
for hours on end.

26:13.782 --> 26:17.383
I didn't bring any extra
gloves with me which was

26:17.418 --> 26:19.051
kind of stupid.

26:19.086 --> 26:21.952
Those kind of silly little
mistakes can kind of add up.

26:21.988 --> 26:24.854
Really a matter
of life or death.

26:26.191 --> 26:27.856
I can get through this.

26:41.501 --> 26:43.634
I do this about once
a month to get water.

26:43.669 --> 26:46.069
Sometimes more,
sometimes less.

26:46.437 --> 26:48.170
It's a six-mile round trip.

26:48.205 --> 26:50.705
And right now
it's 20 or 30 below.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
Son of a (bleep).

26:52.775 --> 26:56.309
Carrying 200 pounds of water
up the hill for hours on end.

26:56.344 --> 26:58.077
It's kind of like
running a marathon.

27:00.714 --> 27:03.780
Stuck on my (bleep).
It's the worst thing ever.

27:03.816 --> 27:06.449
But then I'll be home.

27:07.185 --> 27:08.817
I do come face to
face with a lot of, like,

27:08.852 --> 27:12.653
mortal danger, on a
pretty regular basis out here.

27:13.922 --> 27:16.989
But I also have a lot
more power to control it.

27:17.558 --> 27:20.925
In the city, if a guy is
driving a truck and he's on

27:20.960 --> 27:23.594
his cell phone, he can
crush me and there's basically

27:23.629 --> 27:26.962
nothing I can do about it.

27:28.699 --> 27:32.766
Out here, I have to
confront the danger myself.

27:34.603 --> 27:37.203
For me, that's peace of mind.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.205
It reminds me
that I am mortal.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.207
And I think that does a
person a lot of good.

27:50.747 --> 27:53.080
MICHAEL: This
living within my means.

27:53.115 --> 27:58.483
This developing a rural
landscape from scratch.

27:58.552 --> 28:03.086
There's a lot of gain from this
pain and that is independence.

28:10.193 --> 28:11.992
Lift with your legs.

28:12.028 --> 28:13.927
Ugh. If you can.

28:13.962 --> 28:18.297
Ugh. Ugh!

28:27.838 --> 28:31.239
This is a really heavy
section of the wall.

28:32.141 --> 28:35.408
Let's not let this get
any sort of momentum.

28:35.443 --> 28:39.277
If it gets any momentum,
I'm standing out of the way.

28:39.313 --> 28:43.380
I don't want this
falling, on me.

28:51.788 --> 28:55.788
♪ ♪

28:55.824 --> 28:58.190
Not bad.

28:58.225 --> 29:01.125
One more and that
whole wall is up.

29:07.598 --> 29:09.831
Bam!

29:12.201 --> 29:14.334
So, this might not look
pretty with all this old,

29:14.369 --> 29:16.936
used stuff put
together as a cabin.

29:16.971 --> 29:21.339
But I have this old picture
of my family's fish camp

29:21.374 --> 29:23.440
somewhere around the
Eel Ground Reserve on the

29:23.475 --> 29:26.475
Miramichi River
in New Brunswick, Canada.

29:26.511 --> 29:28.844
A lot of folks just took
whatever scrap lumber they

29:28.879 --> 29:30.978
could get from a sawmill.

29:31.014 --> 29:34.047
Whatever roll of tar paper
they could get their hands on.

29:34.082 --> 29:35.448
They were poor folks.

29:35.483 --> 29:38.016
They were poor, native people,
just trying to put up a

29:38.052 --> 29:40.551
structure and survive.

29:40.587 --> 29:43.253
And so I'm not too far
off from how some of my

29:43.289 --> 29:46.455
grandparents and
great-grandparents lived.

29:46.491 --> 29:48.623
They just lived
within their means.

29:48.659 --> 29:51.659
And they did all right,
and they were happy.

29:51.694 --> 29:53.593
I'm getting a lot done.

29:53.629 --> 29:55.395
Getting all these walls up.

29:55.430 --> 29:58.630
I just gotta finish
this one last wall.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.266
The entry wall,
it's not repairable.

30:02.301 --> 30:06.702
And so, I'm gonna have to go
ahead and build a new wall.

30:15.543 --> 30:19.077
Having all four walls
up of the first story
is a good feeling.

30:19.112 --> 30:23.480
I hope to best it tomorrow
by getting the deck

30:23.515 --> 30:26.916
and the second story up.

30:32.154 --> 30:35.054
JESSI: You've
gotta be stubborn.

30:35.090 --> 30:37.089
Full of tenacity.

30:37.124 --> 30:38.790
Persistent.

30:38.826 --> 30:41.158
That's just kind of part of
homesteading out here in the

30:41.194 --> 30:45.028
middle of nowhere, and I will
do everything that I can to

30:45.063 --> 30:47.896
sustain this
type of lifestyle.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.767
CHRIS: It looks like
it'll spiral right off.

30:53.802 --> 30:55.134
JESSI: I mean, if
we take this out,

30:55.170 --> 30:56.635
it's gonna be a huge mess.

30:56.671 --> 30:58.837
CHRIS: A mess.
Okay. That's fine.

30:58.872 --> 31:01.772
It is really cold
outside those rafters.

31:01.808 --> 31:04.674
The back of the house has gotta
be the draftiest place here.

31:04.709 --> 31:08.510
My thermometer gun, it
hits around 20 degrees
at this back corner.

31:08.545 --> 31:10.378
Every time I'm back here,
my feet are cold,

31:10.413 --> 31:11.846
my hands are cold.

31:11.881 --> 31:15.248
And we've never been
able to stop the drafts.

31:15.283 --> 31:17.149
I was doing some
math last night.

31:17.184 --> 31:20.418
I counted them up, I
think there's 60 rafters.

31:20.453 --> 31:24.988
And it's somewhere between
1,600 to 2,000 linear feet

31:25.023 --> 31:29.090
that we need to do the ceiling
and block off the airflow

31:29.126 --> 31:31.325
up to the roof.

31:31.361 --> 31:36.662
Downfall is, is I was only
able to get 800 feet of it here.

31:36.697 --> 31:38.363
JESSI: So, we do
not have enough?

31:38.399 --> 31:39.964
CHRIS: We don't have enough.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.167
But what I was thinking is
if I just cut this in half,

31:44.202 --> 31:47.069
the diameter
actually doesn't change,

31:47.104 --> 31:49.471
and it should still fill
the same amount of space.

31:49.506 --> 31:52.439
So if we just cut it, uh,
that gives us 1,600 feet.

31:52.508 --> 31:53.573
Right?

31:53.609 --> 31:55.074
And that's going to be
like the bare minimum.

31:55.110 --> 31:57.443
Some of the holes
above us are really small,

31:57.478 --> 32:02.546
and I was thinking we
would actually cut some
of them into quarters.

32:02.581 --> 32:04.881
That should give us more
than enough to do this entire

32:04.916 --> 32:07.449
ceiling without
worrying about running out.

32:07.485 --> 32:09.384
Can put the
quarter piece there,

32:09.419 --> 32:13.120
I can put big half
pieces into these large logs.

32:13.155 --> 32:18.056
And even some of these
larger gaps I bet the
quarter pieces will fit.

32:18.092 --> 32:21.025
Backer rod's used for, like,
construction with large gaps.

32:21.060 --> 32:24.294
It's a closed cell foam, so
I don't mind cutting this in

32:24.329 --> 32:26.095
half and sticking it up there.

32:26.130 --> 32:28.363
I still think it's
gonna block the air.

32:28.399 --> 32:29.664
This is kind of a pain.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.032
It's like
cutting a wet noodle.

32:31.067 --> 32:32.566
Ugh.

32:32.601 --> 32:35.268
It's, like, hard to cut and then
it cuts the wrong direction.

32:35.303 --> 32:38.136
JESSI: Two feet
down, 798 left to go.

32:38.172 --> 32:41.505
CHRIS: Ugh.
This is painfully slow.

32:41.541 --> 32:43.607
JESSI: We can't do
this for 800 feet.

32:43.642 --> 32:45.308
CHRIS: No, I'd
rather cut firewood.

32:45.343 --> 32:49.377
JESSI: You're right,
it's really, really
hard to stay centered.

32:50.046 --> 32:51.712
Oh, no!

32:51.747 --> 32:53.480
What do I do now?

32:53.515 --> 32:55.715
CHRIS: We're wasting material,
we're gonna be way short to be

32:55.750 --> 32:58.917
able to cover up the ceiling
to get it warm in the cabin.

32:58.952 --> 33:01.185
We've gotta come up with a
better idea on how to cut this.

33:01.220 --> 33:03.220
JESSI: This couldn't be worse.

33:03.255 --> 33:04.454
This couldn't be worse!

33:04.489 --> 33:06.155
How do you think that
we could do this better?

33:13.128 --> 33:15.728
I don't think I should
be in charge of this.

33:15.763 --> 33:18.730
CHRIS: We've gotta come
up with a better idea
on how to cut this.

33:18.765 --> 33:21.799
We can't just lay
in 800 feet of this.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.334
Otherwise, we're
gonna be way short.

33:24.369 --> 33:27.970
We need somewhere around 1,600
feet on the minimum to be able

33:28.005 --> 33:29.971
to cover up what we need to
cover on the ceiling to get it

33:30.006 --> 33:31.639
warm in the cabin.

33:31.674 --> 33:34.007
JESSI: That's great.

33:34.743 --> 33:37.042
CHRIS: Everything's trial and
error out here on the Cosna,

33:37.078 --> 33:39.811
and sometimes you just gotta
make do with what you have.

33:39.846 --> 33:43.213
Up at an angle just
to make the wire go
through a little easier.

33:43.215 --> 33:46.315
Today, I'm trying to figure
out a way to make a foam cutter.

33:46.351 --> 33:48.250
Whatever it takes to
seal this ceiling up.

33:48.285 --> 33:50.952
I've got a drill battery
that I'm gonna hook it up to.

33:50.987 --> 33:54.354
JESSI: And then it's
gonna heat up this huge wire,

33:54.389 --> 33:57.923
burn into the wood, and get
the middle part hot enough to

33:57.958 --> 33:59.958
melt the foam and cut it.

33:59.993 --> 34:01.092
CHRIS: You've got the idea.

34:01.127 --> 34:02.192
JESSI: Without
burning the house down.

34:02.228 --> 34:03.960
Yeah.

34:03.996 --> 34:06.562
CHRIS: I'm just
going to test it.

34:08.966 --> 34:10.865
Wow.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.600
This is a great little
contraption we built
for cutting foam.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.502
I just don't want to do
anymore in the house.

34:16.537 --> 34:20.171
Because with every great
contraption comes a little risk.

34:20.974 --> 34:22.940
We're using a battery and we
are just straight running one

34:22.975 --> 34:24.874
wire from
positive to negative,

34:24.910 --> 34:27.576
and we're making it like
an absolute open circuit.

34:27.611 --> 34:29.244
You could blow
these batteries up,

34:29.279 --> 34:31.912
when they explode,
they explode with fire
shooting everywhere.

34:31.948 --> 34:33.180
Perfect.

34:33.215 --> 34:34.814
We're gonna try and play
this as safe as we can.

34:34.849 --> 34:36.549
Okay.
I'm ready when you are.

34:36.584 --> 34:38.984
We hook the batteries up,
the wire starts smoking,

34:39.019 --> 34:40.585
the wood's burning.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.519
We get the foam in there,
and as we're pulling that foam

34:42.555 --> 34:44.821
through, it gets
easier with the heat.

34:44.856 --> 34:45.755
There it goes.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.289
And we're getting
these nice clean cuts.

34:47.324 --> 34:49.591
Burn, baby, burn.

34:49.626 --> 34:50.958
That's perfect.

34:50.994 --> 34:52.359
JESSI: To heck
with the knives.

34:52.395 --> 34:54.160
In with the bush craft.

34:54.196 --> 34:58.130
CHRIS: And nice.
Look at that!

34:59.499 --> 35:01.999
All right.

35:02.034 --> 35:04.601
I feel like this
is gonna pay off.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.402
JESSI: Chris and I are
working on the back corner.

35:06.437 --> 35:10.471
I'm putting my hand
up and you can feel an
immediate difference.

35:10.507 --> 35:12.006
Can't feel a draft at all.

35:12.041 --> 35:13.840
I mean, this
foam really works.

35:13.875 --> 35:18.110
But we really have to seal up
each end all the way to the

35:18.145 --> 35:22.413
ceiling, so you
can't get air in or out.

35:22.448 --> 35:23.580
CHRIS: Ow!

35:23.615 --> 35:25.081
Some of these
get really tight.

35:25.116 --> 35:26.815
JESSI: Really tight.

35:26.851 --> 35:29.117
CHRIS: Ugh, it's good
thing that we made
some quarter pieces.

35:29.152 --> 35:31.118
JESSI: Yeah!

35:31.154 --> 35:33.086
CHRIS: Good job, love.
That actually looks really good.

35:33.122 --> 35:35.221
JESSI: That looks really good.
That was the perfect size.

35:35.256 --> 35:37.289
CHRIS: You're hired.

35:37.324 --> 35:40.091
Next is we've got
100 more to do.

35:41.227 --> 35:43.360
Pow!

35:43.395 --> 35:46.262
It's already warmer in here.

35:46.297 --> 35:49.030
JESSI: It is now
30 below outside.

35:49.066 --> 35:52.366
And it's reading like
almost 60 degrees back here.

35:52.401 --> 35:54.867
I mean, that's like
a huge difference.

35:54.903 --> 35:58.336
It's a big deal, about the
amount of heat that we're

35:58.372 --> 36:00.972
going to trap and keep and
the amount of wood we're

36:01.007 --> 36:03.373
not gonna have to burn.

36:03.408 --> 36:05.808
It's going to be the warmest
30-below night that we've ever

36:05.843 --> 36:07.376
spent in the cabin.

36:07.411 --> 36:08.543
CHRIS: We got
lots of foam left.

36:08.579 --> 36:09.711
Let's keep after it.

36:09.746 --> 36:12.346
JESSI: Got lots of foam!
Let's start on the next piece.

36:18.152 --> 36:20.651
MICHAEL: A lot of the native
elders here in Alaska tell you

36:20.687 --> 36:23.120
that sometimes you
just should not go out,

36:23.155 --> 36:26.689
and you should not
be doing things in
certain cold weather.

36:26.724 --> 36:30.224
And if you try to fight it,
that could mean your life.

36:36.397 --> 36:39.664
All right, today
is 20 below zero.

36:39.699 --> 36:42.099
You take a bucket of molasses.

36:42.134 --> 36:44.901
You try to dump it
out at 20 below zero,

36:44.936 --> 36:46.602
it ain't going nowhere.

36:46.637 --> 36:48.503
And so, building
in the below zero,

36:48.539 --> 36:51.605
everything slows down.

36:51.641 --> 36:55.708
Your tools don't wanna start,
technology acts a fool.

36:55.743 --> 36:57.409
Things get brittle.

36:57.444 --> 37:00.178
And so I just can't sit
around and have this structure

37:00.213 --> 37:02.513
halfway done and walk away.

37:02.548 --> 37:05.448
I gotta keep
moving and get it up.

37:05.483 --> 37:09.050
And so today's the day that
I've chosen to winch up these

37:09.086 --> 37:13.420
heavy pieces up here
onto the second-story deck.

37:14.823 --> 37:18.957
I've actually never pulled
anything with this thing before.

37:18.992 --> 37:23.326
Winches and chainsaws
are nasty devices to use.

37:23.362 --> 37:26.195
And then you combine a
chainsaw with a winch?

37:26.230 --> 37:27.763
That's doubly nasty.

37:27.798 --> 37:31.899
We'll see how it
works at 20 below.

37:31.934 --> 37:35.701
Got a really steep jump to
get this thing up there.

37:35.737 --> 37:38.070
I'm gonna go
cautious, go slow.

37:38.105 --> 37:42.839
Probably be about, uh,
500 pounds up on that deck.

37:42.875 --> 37:46.809
Something like this lets
loose and that comes back,

37:46.844 --> 37:48.476
that's a projectile.

37:48.512 --> 37:51.212
Crack your cranium.

37:52.081 --> 37:55.515
(motor whirring).

37:55.550 --> 37:57.482
As long as I try my
hardest to be safe,

37:57.518 --> 37:58.617
this should go all right.

37:58.652 --> 37:59.917
But there's no guarantee.

37:59.953 --> 38:03.486
This is not the right weather
to be doing stuff like this.

38:06.824 --> 38:10.525
(motor whirring).

38:10.560 --> 38:12.693
I think I should be good.

38:12.728 --> 38:15.728
All right.

38:17.765 --> 38:19.297
Got even colder.

38:19.332 --> 38:23.533
You gotta suit up with
more stuff to keep the
cold off your skin.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.970
All right, this piece is
the largest one so far.

38:29.005 --> 38:30.938
It's gonna go in the center.

38:30.973 --> 38:32.539
I'm gonna go ahead and
take my time on this one,

38:32.575 --> 38:33.973
'cause it's a big one.

38:34.009 --> 38:37.342
And so, the snap
got a little damaged.

38:37.378 --> 38:41.712
But, uh, just gotta get
two more pulls out of it.

38:41.747 --> 38:46.115
I guesstimate this one to be
right around 800 pounds or so.

38:47.118 --> 38:52.086
(motor whirring).

38:59.659 --> 39:03.026
I feel like the whole building
is gonna come tumbling down.

39:03.062 --> 39:05.928
It feels like an earthquake
up here every time
I touch the throttle.

39:08.665 --> 39:10.031
(motor whirring).

39:23.075 --> 39:27.809
MICHAEL: Ugh. Yup.

39:29.179 --> 39:32.179
I was jamming up the
clevis against the top plate.

39:32.214 --> 39:34.114
That's that.

39:35.116 --> 39:36.882
That combined with the
weight of that piece,

39:36.917 --> 39:41.152
all hell broke loose, and it
snapped somewhere here

39:41.187 --> 39:43.053
near the winch.

39:43.088 --> 39:45.421
This is what you deal
with in below zero weather.

39:45.456 --> 39:48.056
I'm really
frustrated by this setback.

39:48.092 --> 39:50.591
You can't let mechanical
failures in cold weather stop

39:50.627 --> 39:52.659
you from getting the job done.

39:52.695 --> 39:55.895
I got everything I need
here to fix this winch.

39:56.464 --> 39:58.997
Cut this off right here.

40:00.366 --> 40:02.299
I took that
little clevis pin off,

40:02.334 --> 40:05.334
and I put on a larger
five eighths inch shackle.

40:05.370 --> 40:06.802
It's fixed.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.870
This winch is good to go.

40:08.905 --> 40:11.372
I'm gonna set it
up top, try again.

40:13.909 --> 40:16.942
You can't push your
luck out here when you've
been given a free pass.

40:16.977 --> 40:18.610
And so this time around,

40:18.645 --> 40:21.378
I'm gonna put a helmet
on for this next pull.

40:21.414 --> 40:23.813
So that if it snaps, this
piece of metal ain't coming

40:23.849 --> 40:27.683
back in my face
over 100 mile an hour.

40:35.423 --> 40:37.823
It's a sick feeling, when
you're just doing something

40:37.858 --> 40:42.526
you know is
stupidly dangerous.

40:48.965 --> 40:50.765
There she is.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.466
Miss America.

40:52.501 --> 40:56.502
Everything worked a lot
better with my repair.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.704
What a relief
after such a setback.

41:00.540 --> 41:02.072
I'm safe.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.406
I'm gonna continue forward.

41:03.442 --> 41:05.708
I'm gonna get this deck in
place and start getting the

41:05.743 --> 41:08.109
roof put up.

41:17.584 --> 41:20.584
CHRIS: Just kinda
toss it on there.

41:20.620 --> 41:23.019
Snow is like a
really good insulator.

41:23.055 --> 41:26.922
That'll get all
that airflow to stop.

41:28.759 --> 41:31.792
That's gonna be warm!

41:31.827 --> 41:33.827
I try to think, for every
scoop is one less log that

41:33.862 --> 41:35.428
I'll burn
throughout the winter.

41:35.463 --> 41:36.895
JESSI: Oh, man,
get to scoopin'!

41:36.931 --> 41:38.430
CHRIS: I know.

41:38.465 --> 41:40.965
JESSI: Get to scoopin'!

41:43.535 --> 41:46.101
Now that we have a
winterized cabin...

41:46.137 --> 41:47.769
Whoo!

41:47.805 --> 41:50.738
We're not going to have to use
as many resources and trees.

41:50.773 --> 41:52.839
CHRIS: Nice.

41:52.875 --> 41:55.741
JESSI: And we're gonna have
more time to just enjoy life

41:55.777 --> 41:58.543
out here together.

42:03.448 --> 42:06.582
ALEX: It don't look like it,
it's like 30 below right
now outside.

42:06.617 --> 42:09.684
That's some
pretty dirty clothes.

42:09.719 --> 42:11.852
Laundry takes a lot of water.

42:11.887 --> 42:13.420
It's a lot easier if you can
just put it in a machine and

42:13.455 --> 42:17.222
push a button but, uh, I feel
like my generation needs to be

42:17.258 --> 42:19.290
more responsible than that.

42:19.326 --> 42:22.759
Clean water is not necessarily
an infinite resource.

42:22.795 --> 42:24.494
If you have to haul
water the way I do,

42:24.529 --> 42:27.796
you can certainly
do with a lot less.

42:28.765 --> 42:31.799
Because it's such a
physical chore to get water,

42:31.834 --> 42:34.467
you know, I treat
it like it's gold.

42:34.502 --> 42:36.769
I don't waste a single drop.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.103
If I wanted to haul enough
water to have everything

42:39.139 --> 42:41.739
crystal clean all the time, I
would be the fittest man in

42:41.774 --> 42:45.007
the universe to be honest.

42:48.145 --> 42:49.777
BRITTANY: And there we go.

42:49.813 --> 42:51.178
This is actually working!

42:51.214 --> 42:52.546
What?

42:52.581 --> 42:55.781
It's really great to build
something that I can use to

42:55.817 --> 42:59.417
give gifts and also to
be more self-reliant.

42:59.452 --> 43:01.185
Look what we made.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.486
KALEB: Yum!

43:02.521 --> 43:04.520
BRITTANY: We're creating
memories and I hope the kids

43:04.556 --> 43:06.088
look back at
this time thinking,

43:06.123 --> 43:08.089
"Wow, look what
Mom and I made."

43:08.125 --> 43:10.024
Moment of truth.

43:10.059 --> 43:12.526
KALEB: Oh, man. Whew!

43:12.561 --> 43:15.094
BRITTANY: Hot or good?
KALEB: Both.

43:18.865 --> 43:22.666
MICHAEL: There we go.
Just like that.

43:22.701 --> 43:26.235
I'm gonna get the last bit
of the structure up today.

43:28.105 --> 43:31.905
Grab up a spare wood stove,
I could move into this
thing tomorrow.

43:33.242 --> 43:36.141
I traded a little bit of labor
for an unused building that

43:36.177 --> 43:37.909
was just going to waste.

43:37.945 --> 43:39.544
And that's how a lot
of native people are.

43:39.579 --> 43:42.512
They'll trade work for a tool
or they'll trade a tool for

43:42.548 --> 43:45.815
some beaver mitt.

43:45.850 --> 43:48.650
That's more real than going
to a box store and spending

43:48.685 --> 43:50.918
thousands of dollars.

43:53.088 --> 43:56.055
Hey, I can see
the Tanana River.

44:06.797 --> 44:09.030
(heavy breathing).

44:09.099 --> 44:12.199
JESSI: Last bit.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.402
CHRIS: Well.
JESSI: Onto the next.
