WEBVTT

00:07.741 --> 00:10.311
<i>Yeah, honey,
it's so beautiful here.</i>

00:10.411 --> 00:13.114
And I was thinking,
when I get back,

00:13.214 --> 00:16.050
maybe we should do that trip
you're always talking about.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.852
Yeah, winery.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.694
Yeah. You go ahead and book it.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.662
Ask your mom to watch the dogs.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.066
I love you, too.

01:23.717 --> 01:28.789
Well, did HPD give you
any more info?

01:28.889 --> 01:31.024
Okay. All right, well, you
and Kai head to the beach.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.160
I'll meet you there.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.261
Yeah.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.865
Mm.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.635
Negative. That's good.

01:41.735 --> 01:45.239
Can't be right. I feel
like I got hit by a truck.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.108
It's probably
just the flu.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.643
Flu?

01:49.743 --> 01:52.946
Yeah, it was all the rage
back in the olden days.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.982
So, does that mean I can take
two Tylenol and go to school?

01:57.151 --> 01:58.652
Definitely not.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.223
I would actually rather take
my AP Physics exam

02:02.323 --> 02:03.624
than feel this achy.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.793
Is that a sign of maturity?

02:05.893 --> 02:07.361
Maybe you just
like physics.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.062
All right, drink
lots of fluids.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.532
Don't just sip it, okay?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.402
I got to go, but when I come
back, I will make you soup.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.403
Arroz caldo?

02:15.503 --> 02:17.238
You remember.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.806
It's the best thing ever.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.109
That's the fever talking.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.044
All right.
Mm!

02:24.144 --> 02:27.147
You might not want
to do that.
Oh, come on, now.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.816
I love you.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.950
Love you.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.524
Don't forget. Fluids.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.926
Yeah, yeah.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.862
Victim is Captain
Willem Dennison.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.797
Member of the
Marine Force Recon

02:43.897 --> 02:45.499
and part of the
Black Diamonds.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.934
Well, what's Dennison
doing out here?

02:47.034 --> 02:48.236
There are plenty
of nice beaches

02:48.336 --> 02:49.370
closer to K-Bay.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.838
We don't know.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.140
Robbery gone wrong maybe?

02:53.241 --> 02:54.208
Doesn't look like it.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.244
HPD found his rental car nearby.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.045
Wallet, watch, and wedding ring
were on the passenger seat.

02:58.145 --> 03:01.349
Cell phone and 9mm
were on the body.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.350
Sounds like a suicide.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.617
I'd agree...

03:03.717 --> 03:05.819
except the gun was still
in his waistband.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.756
And these are some
serious blows to the head.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.958
Oh. I suppose the idea
that he came out here

03:11.058 --> 03:13.160
to kill himself
and was unlucky enough

03:13.261 --> 03:16.230
to run into a psychopath
beforehand seems unlikely.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.831
Any witnesses?

03:17.931 --> 03:20.133
No.
Just the fishermen who
found him this morning.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.570
You guys go to K-Bay,
talk to his platoon.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.672
I'll have Casualty Assistance
notify his wife.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.040
I'll follow up
with her afterwards.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.243
Let's find out who
wanted this Marine dead.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.057
Don't move!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.627
Clear!

03:46.727 --> 03:48.228
PTL.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.132
Looks like you got 'em all.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.534
This is a closed exercise.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.002
Master Sergeant Justin Baxter?

03:55.102 --> 03:57.170
We're with NCIS.
We need to speak with you.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.506
Why?

03:58.606 --> 03:59.940
We have news.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.309
All right.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.443
Everybody, listen up.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.612
NCIS has got
something to say.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.748
Might be best if we, uh,
talk to you alone.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.249
Oh, no, we're a team.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.119
Good news, bad news,
we deal with it together.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.826
We regret to inform you

04:18.926 --> 04:21.261
Captain Dennison
was found dead this morning.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.303
Damn.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.507
We're gonna need to ask
you all some questions.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.876
Whatever you need, sir.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.413
Water break.
Everybody out.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.082
Yes, sir.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.721
What exactly happened
to the captain?

04:47.821 --> 04:50.290
He was beaten to death
on a leeward beach.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.360
Any idea why
he would be way out there?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.361
No.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.895
No, any of you guys know?

04:57.598 --> 04:58.999
Okay.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.769
Was Dennison having trouble
with anyone on base?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.404
Not that I'm aware of.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.074
Did Dennison mention having
problems with anybody off base?

05:08.075 --> 05:09.309
Uh...

05:09.410 --> 05:10.544
I can't imagine.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.546
I mean, Captain Dennison
was a great guy.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.714
Everybody loved him.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.615
I was actually talking

05:14.715 --> 05:16.083
to your Marine here.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.519
I agree with
the Master Sergeant, sir.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.721
Somebody killed him.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.190
Any information you have
may help us figure out who.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.258
So we're gonna need to speak
to each one of you separately.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.660
Absolutely, sir,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.962
uh, as soon as you get
permission from Command.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.198
We're on a schedule.
Everybody fall in.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.835
You know what's happening here.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.506
Yeah, they're being really
uncooperative but in a nice way.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.374
They're going shields up.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.543
I saw it all the time
when I was with CID.

05:42.643 --> 05:46.113
They're refusing to answer
questions to protect their own.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.216
To protect who? Not their
captain, that's for sure.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.018
Corporal Grange?

05:51.118 --> 05:53.020
Yes, sir.
Did you notice

05:53.120 --> 05:55.656
Captain Dennison's
behavior change recently?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.257
Not that I saw.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.526
He was always upbeat.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.527
A really...

05:59.627 --> 06:00.861
Great guy?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.397
Yes, sir.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.505
Hey.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.840
Yeah.
Listen.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.109
I was in the Marine Corps
before joining NCIS,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.780
so I get where
you're coming from.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.749
You want to protect your unit,
but, look, don't you want

06:21.849 --> 06:23.751
to help us figure out what
happened to your captain?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.118
Of course we do.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.387
If we knew something,
we'd do something.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.497
Whoa.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.899
Nice swing, Doc.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.801
We could use you
on the NCIS team.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.170
"Hitting is an art
but not an exact science."

06:43.270 --> 06:44.472
Rod Carew.

06:44.572 --> 06:47.007
Uh, Minnesota Twins,
second base, right?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.610
Yes, 1991 Hall of Fame. Wow.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.680
I-I wouldn't have expected you
to be a baseball fan.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.347
Well, just the Twins.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.684
Only way to connect with my
family growing up in Red Wing.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.120
I spent a summer memorizing
the stats of every player,

07:00.220 --> 07:03.457
major and minor,
from 1977 to 1983.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.794
I was hoping it would make me
feel like less of the odd child.

07:06.894 --> 07:07.928
Did it help?

07:08.028 --> 07:10.464
Only freaked them out more.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.699
Wow.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.900
Captain Dennison had

07:13.000 --> 07:14.935
severe blunt force trauma
to the head.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.369
Wound pattern suggests
the murder weapon

07:16.470 --> 07:17.871
was rounded, like a bat.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.141
"Like a bat,"
so you aren't sure?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.543
Oh, no, I'm sure.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.845
I found traces
of wood particles in the wound.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.580
Grains of Northern White Ash,

07:26.680 --> 07:28.381
popular in forests
in the northeast.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.418
Narrows it down
to about 150 models.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.687
Well, whatever bat was used,
it was no match for a gun,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.388
which our Marine had
but never used.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.790
He didn't have a chance.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.959
The first blow was likely
to the back of the head.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.129
Causing nerve damage
that would incapacitate him.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.064
So, a surprise attack. Yes.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.800
And the second blow came
from a different direction.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.736
Made direct contact

07:48.836 --> 07:49.870
with the frontal lobe.

07:49.970 --> 07:50.871
It's possible you're looking

07:50.971 --> 07:52.472
for two attackers.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.441
Or one elite
switch hitter.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.177
This team of
Black Diamonds

07:57.277 --> 08:00.113
has been working
together since 2017.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.116
After a successful mission
in Afghanistan,

08:03.216 --> 08:04.351
their reputation
was only heightened

08:04.451 --> 08:06.319
by their next
assignment in Niger.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.756
What happened?
They saved a
bunch of civilians

08:08.856 --> 08:10.724
from a fire started
by insurgents.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.325
And they got a lot of press.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.128
They've been the jewel
of the Marine Corps ever since.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.865
Huh.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.233
When I spoke to Dennison's wife,

08:20.333 --> 08:23.203
she told me that he was looking
to transfer out.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.938
Why do that if they
were so successful?

08:25.038 --> 08:27.507
Seems like the mood changed
after that mission.

08:27.608 --> 08:31.111
Yeah, records indicate there
was discord amongst the ranks.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.213
Several members were written
up for insubordination.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.816
Nothing too serious
on the surface,

08:35.916 --> 08:37.517
except for this guy.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.518
Former Black Diamond

08:38.619 --> 08:39.820
Sergeant Ellis Kane.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.021
Once on the fast track,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.990
but after the
fire in Niger,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.992
Kane barely avoided
court-martial

08:45.092 --> 08:46.126
for assaulting Captain Dennison.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.828
What was the fight about?

08:47.928 --> 08:48.896
Neither would say.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.798
Kane took a general discharge

08:50.898 --> 08:52.099
to avoid court-martial.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.300
Okay, where's he now?

08:53.400 --> 08:54.668
No idea.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.837
Fell off the map since
leaving the Marine Corps.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.305
Maps?

08:58.405 --> 09:00.540
Who needs maps?
I got maps.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.410
What?

09:03.510 --> 09:04.978
You started without me.
Makes me insecure.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.848
What'd you get off
Dennison's cell?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.550
Geolocations on
Dennison's phone,

09:10.651 --> 09:13.887
placing him at an unusual spot
the day before his murder.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.522
In North Shore?

09:15.623 --> 09:17.024
Not just the North Shore,

09:17.124 --> 09:20.560
a rando locale in the middle
of Mokuleia Forest Reserve.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.863
Were there any training
exercises happening out there?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.264
No. In fact,

09:24.364 --> 09:25.699
the rest of his unit
was playing volleyball

09:25.799 --> 09:27.267
on the beach while he was gone.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.002
Okay. Kai, Ernie,
you guys do some digging.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.138
See what you can get
on Sergeant Kane. Jesse?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.241
You and I are going
to Mokuleia Forest.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.913
<i>All right, Alex, but however
much water you think you need,</i>

09:40.013 --> 09:41.348
<i>just double it.</i>

09:41.448 --> 09:43.383
I love you.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.485
Remember when our kids
were little and they would

09:45.585 --> 09:49.923
come home with all these
weird-sounding sicknesses?

09:50.023 --> 09:51.859
The croup?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.393
Oh, remember that
hand, foot and mouth one?

09:53.493 --> 09:55.028
Oh, gross.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.497
I kind of miss it.
Hmm?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.499
Not Alex being sick, but...

09:59.599 --> 10:02.269
him needing me and wanting
me to take care of him.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.538
Trust me, he's always going to
want you to take care of him,

10:05.639 --> 10:07.007
just in different ways.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.609
Like "Can I get 20 bucks
for a date" kind of ways?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.978
Exactly.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.181
Except these days
what date costs $20?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.559
Nothing but
birds and trees.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.428
Yeah, but there's got
to be some reason

10:28.528 --> 10:31.965
that Dennison drove an hour
and 15 minutes from K-Bay.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.034
You hear that?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.378
Hello?

10:47.848 --> 10:50.083
Where'd he go?
I don't know.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.186
Drop your weapon.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.356
Hands in the air.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.661
Sergeant Ellis Kane?

11:01.762 --> 11:02.662
No.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.398
Brother Ellis Kane.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.135
I serve the Lord now.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.778
<i>You don't seem surprised to hear</i>

11:17.878 --> 11:19.146
<i>about Captain Dennison's murder.</i>

11:19.246 --> 11:21.815
None of us know when
our time will come.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.616
Only that
it will come.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.353
Did you know his time
was about to come?

11:26.453 --> 11:27.855
Because we have
reason to believe

11:27.955 --> 11:30.023
that Dennison paid you
a visit two nights ago.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.158
He did.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.059
And what'd you
two talk about?

11:32.159 --> 11:33.226
Old times.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.862
We were part of the same unit.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.564
We did two tours
together, but...

11:37.664 --> 11:39.032
clearly you already know that.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.769
We also know that when you
left the Black Diamonds,

11:41.869 --> 11:43.636
it wasn't exactly on good terms.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.672
Thankfully, I made
peace with my past.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.507
I found a
higher calling.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.209
Before or after you assaulted

11:49.309 --> 11:51.078
Captain Dennison in Niger?

11:53.446 --> 11:57.017
Look, can you explain why
Dennison came to see you

11:57.117 --> 11:59.719
and then 24 hours later
was found beaten to death

11:59.820 --> 12:02.722
on a beach six miles from here?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.526
No. I cannot.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.928
Cannot or will not?

12:08.028 --> 12:10.097
Because I'm getting
a strong "shields up" vibe

12:10.197 --> 12:12.766
from you, Brother. And for the
life of me, I can't think why.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.535
Okay, where were you
last night at 8:00 p.m.?

12:15.635 --> 12:16.536
I was in my cell.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.338
Reading.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.672
I was in bed by 9:00.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.409
Can someone
confirm that?
No, I was alone.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.444
So you won't tell us why

12:24.544 --> 12:26.213
you met with Dennison
the night before he was murdered

12:26.313 --> 12:29.116
and you have no alibi
for his actual murder.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.622
That's my call to worship.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.324
May I go?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.425
The abbot doesn't like it

12:38.525 --> 12:40.293
if we're late.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.929
Sure.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.396
Just don't plan on leaving
the island without calling us.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.764
Okay, Brother?

12:46.099 --> 12:47.134
Yeah.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.605
Well, what do
you think?

12:52.705 --> 12:54.441
I think we should be
taking him with us.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.444
He's gonna be a tough nut to
crack without more information.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.079
Like?
Like what happened

12:59.179 --> 13:01.514
between Kane and Dennison
in Niger.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.616
And did it follow them
here to Oahu.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.524
Are you ready to talk Kane?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.293
Yeah, absolutely,
but first...

13:13.393 --> 13:14.394
who's that?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.029
Uh, the Marine turned monk,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.198
person of interest
in our homicide.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.634
No, I mean who's that?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.304
I have no idea.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.140
Is she unpacking?

13:30.743 --> 13:31.644
Who's that?

13:31.744 --> 13:33.513
I was hoping you knew.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.882
No idea.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.683
Is she unpacking?

13:36.783 --> 13:39.319
Maybe she's lost.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.021
Or moving in.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.590
What are you doing?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.993
I'm gonna act like the
professional interrogator I am

13:46.093 --> 13:47.127
and ask.

13:52.799 --> 13:53.733
Can I help you?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.802
Oh, gosh, no.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.737
I'm so sorry
about the mess.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.706
I was just looking for
my comfier combat boots.

13:59.806 --> 14:00.974
Just got off the plane.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.309
Oh, from?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.844
Guantanamo Bay.
They didn't tell you guys?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.779
They should've
told you that.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.117
Left at 0300, had to
refuel in Mexico City. Oh.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.818
Hot. So hot.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.653
But doesn't matter
'cause I'm here now.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.589
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
All that, all that way.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.091
Sorry, you are...

14:18.191 --> 14:19.726
Sergeant Summer Westmore.

14:19.826 --> 14:23.230
Marine CID coming in
from Guantanamo Bay.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.066
Chief of CID
sent her to us.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.270
I, um, I found
the 1039 form online.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.741
In the place where
we keep... forms.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.709
Nice boots, by the way.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.717
Um... why did your chief
send you to us?

14:44.817 --> 14:46.686
I'm here about Captain Dennison.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.787
Because...?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.990
I know why he was murdered.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.294
On May 21, 2019,
the Black Diamonds

14:54.394 --> 14:56.129
were doing a routine
house-to-house search

14:56.229 --> 14:58.065
for insurgents in Niamey, Niger.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.833
A fire broke out in a civilian
dwelling, killing two people.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.535
Yeah, we're aware.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.038
They were heroes, saved almost
a dozen others from that fire.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.474
Master Sergeant Justin
Baxter was even awarded

15:07.574 --> 15:08.976
the Navy and
Marine Corps Medal.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.677
I have reason to believe
that's not the whole story.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.745
Are you saying they didn't
save these civilians?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.081
No, that part's true.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.548
Shortly after the incident,

15:15.648 --> 15:18.218
I received a tip from
a member of their unit.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.288
He claimed he witnessed
Justin Baxter start the fire.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.757
Okay, this witness
offer up a motive?

15:24.857 --> 15:27.127
Earlier in the day,
a local gave Baxter lip.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.796
That young man and his mother
both died in the fire.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.664
Baxter murdered them?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.700
For giving him attitude?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.969
According to my witness.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.604
Was your witness
Sergeant Ellis Kane?

15:37.704 --> 15:39.339
Yes.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.074
How'd you know?

15:41.174 --> 15:42.275
He lives on
the island.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.177
He joined
a Benedictine monastery

15:44.277 --> 15:45.645
after leaving the Marine Corps.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.380
Is this what led
to the altercation

15:47.480 --> 15:49.249
between Kane and
Dennison back in Niger?

15:49.349 --> 15:52.185
No one corroborated
Kane's claim against Baxter.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.686
And Captain Dennison
wasn't willing

15:53.786 --> 15:55.822
to investigate the
incident further.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.825
So, it could be that
Kane was pushed out

15:58.925 --> 16:00.327
for making a complaint.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.195
Which would explain
the bad blood between them.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.265
Yeah, but not why Dennison
came to see him two nights ago.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.700
Look, if Kane was trying to
do the right thing in Niger,

16:07.800 --> 16:09.502
why wouldn't he
just tell us?

16:09.602 --> 16:10.503
Maybe he started the fire,

16:10.603 --> 16:11.904
blamed it on Baxter,

16:12.005 --> 16:14.307
and Dennison realized it
and came to confront him.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.976
Which means we have two solid
suspects in Dennison's murder.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.079
Let's get Ernie on Kane
and Baxter's movements

16:19.179 --> 16:20.947
over the last few days.
Sergeant Westmore?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.150
Down to stay,
give us a hand?
Sure.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.053
Guys, Niger is the key to what
happened to Dennison.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.321
Let's get to the
bottom of it.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.726
A sunny September 8th morning,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.062
Kristen and Robbie Jacobs drove...

16:35.162 --> 16:37.597
Alex, I'm home.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.299
Hey.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.434
Soup will be ready
in like 45 minutes, okay?

16:41.534 --> 16:42.669
Oh, no need, Jane.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.771
Soup is covered for
our little patient.

16:44.871 --> 16:48.575
Cassandra. How sweet.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.115
How you feeling, buddy?

16:55.982 --> 16:57.250
Still not great. Yeah.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.386
Probably stress from
everything he has going on.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.088
You know it wreaks havoc
on the immune system.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.789
Or he's just sick.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.363
My mom. Always something,
am I right?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.467
We've been watching
a <i>Crime Trail</i> marathon.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.705
Know what I've learned?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.207
That it's always the husband?

17:20.307 --> 17:21.608
Mm-hmm.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.410
Still warm
but a little better.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.778
Oh, one sec.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.080
Hey, Ernie, what's up?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.515
Trying to do everything I can

17:28.615 --> 17:30.717
to track down
Brother Kane's whereabouts.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.984
He doesn't have a cell phone

17:32.085 --> 17:33.420
and there are no cameras
at the monastery.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.621
But...?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.589
On a lark,
I looked at the closest

17:36.689 --> 17:38.125
CCTV footage I could find.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.661
A gas station a mile from
the monastery where I found

17:41.761 --> 17:43.296
Brother Kane using a pay phone

17:43.396 --> 17:45.365
an hour
before Dennison's murder.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.634
He said he was alone
in his cell at 8:00 p.m.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.636
Well, that's
definitely not true.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.305
I'm working on getting a record
from the pay phone company,

17:52.405 --> 17:53.673
but it's gonna take a beat.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.542
Okay. Jesse and I
will talk to him.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.112
Let me know if you
find anything else. Bye.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.147
I got to go back to work.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.315
No worries, Mom.
Cass has it.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.316
Hmm.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.817
Sure she does.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.187
See you.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.758
But they were no match
for a bloodthirsty killer.

18:11.858 --> 18:12.959
Of course I'm
all packed,

18:13.059 --> 18:15.162
but I don't think
we'll need much.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.964
Baby, I
already told you.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.267
I'll stop by later. Okay.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.035
Okay, bye, I
got to go now.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.244
Brother Kane.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.845
Are you here to arrest me?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.347
Look, we know
that you lied to us

18:34.447 --> 18:35.815
about your alibi the night
of Dennison's murder.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.351
I didn't murder
Captain Dennison.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.819
Then why didn't you
tell us the truth?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.288
I'm sorry
I'm unable to give you

18:41.388 --> 18:42.622
the answers that you want.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.724
Unable or unwilling?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.459
Look, you need to tell us
everything you know

18:46.559 --> 18:48.295
about Captain Dennison
and what happened in Niger,

18:48.395 --> 18:50.530
or we have no
choice but to...

18:50.630 --> 18:52.299
Someone's there.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.102
Hey, stop!

18:56.203 --> 18:59.005
Stay here.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.380
Over there.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.982
You go left.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.605
We lost 'em.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.747
You think
Kane's safe here?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.048
'Cause, based on
the two guys I saw

19:42.148 --> 19:43.783
in the kitchen earlier
making bread,

19:43.883 --> 19:46.185
it's not a, uh, "make a
circle, protect your dude"

19:46.286 --> 19:47.420
kind of place.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.889
Make a circle,
protect your dude?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.391
It's not really biblical, is it?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.693
Sure. It's from the, uh,
first Book of Ass Whupping.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.962
Well, someone should
probably stay.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.366
Considering it's a men-only
place, I'm guessing that's me.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.534
That's too bad.

20:04.271 --> 20:07.039
Cassandra's seeing someone else
and Alex doesn't know.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.142
Oof.
Yeah.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.078
I'm sorry.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.048
I think I'd rather sleep
in the woods

20:16.148 --> 20:18.785
and guard Brother Kane
than go home tonight.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.621
You stay here, work on Kane.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.892
He knows something or
he wouldn't be a target.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.565
Oh, good, you're back.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.934
Alex is sleeping.
I'm heading out.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.637
Why don't you stay for a minute?

20:48.281 --> 20:52.552
Did Alex ever tell you
what I did before NCIS?

20:52.652 --> 20:53.986
Like, he may have mentioned it.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.356
It sounds like it was
pretty intense stuff.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.690
It was.

20:59.225 --> 21:03.162
You know, we used to have a word
for that feeling we had

21:03.262 --> 21:06.433
in our gut when
something wasn't right.

21:06.533 --> 21:12.405
Like... a situation, a person,

21:12.505 --> 21:15.508
or just a shady building.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.311
We called it...

21:18.411 --> 21:19.312
spoozy.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.047
Okay.

21:21.147 --> 21:24.551
Now, the name came
from my very first asset.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.754
Amad Spoozy.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.223
Amad was somebody
that I relied on.

21:31.324 --> 21:34.661
He would tell me information
about the bad guys.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.329
But the problem was,

21:36.429 --> 21:40.132
he was telling the bad guys
information about me.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.101
Oh, wow. Not cool.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.771
That is spoozy.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.006
Totally spoozy.

21:47.106 --> 21:52.244
Now, the problem with playing
both sides is that eventually

21:52.345 --> 21:54.447
someone finds out.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.082
Who found out?

21:56.182 --> 21:58.117
Oh, everyone.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.587
My asset called me,
he was scared.

22:00.687 --> 22:04.256
And I tried to help,
but it was too late.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.860
Someone threw a grenade
through his bedroom window.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.636
That phone call you had
with your mom?

22:16.736 --> 22:19.205
That was spoozy.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.241
It's not what you think.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.810
So, you're not...

22:23.910 --> 22:27.714
going on a trip with a guy,
abandoning Alex?

22:27.814 --> 22:30.282
Okay, yes, it's what you think.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.453
But I'm not abandoning Alex,
he's abandoning me.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.455
He's going to college

22:35.555 --> 22:37.990
with no gap year, no Europe.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.428
He thinks we'll stay together,
but I know how this goes.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.430
And he'll move on.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.899
So you're moving on first.

22:48.635 --> 22:49.569
Are you gonna tell him?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.337
Mm-mm.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.309
Because I have to tell him.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.881
Otherwise you'll throw a grenade
through my window?

23:01.981 --> 23:04.383
Okay, that wasn't
the point of the story.

23:06.453 --> 23:09.656
Hey. You and Alex had
a really nice relationship.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.959
Maybe it needs
to come to an end.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.996
But it is always better
when things end well.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.605
Jesse in a monastery?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.807
Please tell me they're
making him wear the robes.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.009
Yeah, well, he hadn't
packed a bag, so maybe.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.745
I mean, look, I think he
would look good in the robes.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.280
Jedi-esque.
Please.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.282
More like "Sun City
walk to the bottom

23:36.382 --> 23:38.851
of the driveway for
the paper"-esque.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.853
I don't understand any
of your references,

23:40.953 --> 23:42.689
but I like 'em.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.457
You'll get there, friend.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.359
Okay, so...

23:47.460 --> 23:50.029
it does seem like your theory
that Captain Dennison's murder

23:50.129 --> 23:52.632
was about the fire
in Niger is spot-on.

23:52.732 --> 23:53.900
The question is
whether you're right

23:54.000 --> 23:56.002
about Baxter,
or if other members

23:56.102 --> 23:57.837
of the Black Diamonds
are involved.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.974
We need to separate them,
see if anyone's conscience

24:02.074 --> 24:03.576
is stronger than
their Marine fidelity.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.512
That's a good idea.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.913
Hey, Ernie?

24:07.013 --> 24:08.414
Photoshop a picture of Jesse
in the robes?

24:08.515 --> 24:10.082
No.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.985
See if I can find any secrets
the unit might be keeping?

24:13.085 --> 24:14.320
Yes.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.792
The abbot said it was
okay if you stayed.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.227
Thanks.

24:21.327 --> 24:24.330
What did he say
about the intruder?

24:24.430 --> 24:26.799
I may or may not have been
as forthright about that.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.802
Lying to the abbot.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.204
I don't know
my bylaws, but...

24:32.304 --> 24:34.173
I'm pretty sure that
goes against monk code.

24:35.875 --> 24:40.547
I follow the rituals, I try
hard to keep my focus on God.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.848
But I am a work in progress.

24:45.017 --> 24:45.952
Why'd you end up here?

24:46.052 --> 24:48.320
The outside world was, uh...

24:48.420 --> 24:49.856
too loud for me.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.992
Are you hoping to shut it out?

24:53.926 --> 24:55.962
Yeah, something like that.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.831
You know, Brother...

24:59.999 --> 25:03.335
...some things refuse
to be shut out.

25:04.671 --> 25:07.106
Whatever
happened in Niger...

25:07.206 --> 25:10.577
you can ritual and pray
all you want, but...

25:10.677 --> 25:12.244
it's not gonna make it go away.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.282
You're right.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.951
And some of the things
that I've seen

25:19.051 --> 25:20.853
can't be unseen.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.122
Can't be undone.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.560
Like what Master Sergeant Baxter
did to those people in Niger.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.562
I should go to chapel.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.963
"If we confess

25:31.063 --> 25:33.332
"our sins...

25:33.432 --> 25:37.870
"He is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins

25:37.970 --> 25:39.939
and cleanse us
from all unrighteousness."

25:42.108 --> 25:43.275
You still remember
the scriptures

25:43.375 --> 25:45.077
you memorized
in Catholic school.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.114
Well, mostly I remember
that the nuns,

25:48.214 --> 25:50.016
they didn't like me very much.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.218
If the nuns
liked you too much,

25:52.318 --> 25:55.221
you might've rebelled
against God and not them.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.924
You saying that was strategy?

25:58.024 --> 25:59.091
I'm saying it worked.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.459
You still remember verses.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.362
Many drift away and
they forget it all.

26:03.462 --> 26:04.997
Nah.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.667
I think it's more
just habit than belief

26:07.767 --> 26:09.268
at this point.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.607
I think that's the story
you tell yourself.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.176
Yeah. Maybe.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.445
What story do you tell yourself

26:19.545 --> 26:22.314
to make what happened
to Captain Dennison seem okay?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.770
Special Agent in Charge
Jane Tennant.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.872
You've met Agent Holman.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.606
Heard you were
making the rounds.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.941
May we come in?

26:49.041 --> 26:52.178
Military quarters.
Do you even have to ask?

26:52.945 --> 26:54.580
No, just...

26:54.681 --> 26:56.115
being polite.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.616
We're talking to
everybody in the unit.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.019
And, uh, we heard
you stayed home sick.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.221
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.456
Last night was
a little rocky, though.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.392
Bad fish maybe.

27:11.497 --> 27:14.000
You mind
putting that down?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.236
Master Sergeant Baxter.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.537
Put the knife down or
we will consider it

27:18.637 --> 27:20.239
an overt threat
against us.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.976
You're wound pretty tight,
aren't you, Jane Tennant?

27:24.076 --> 27:25.211
On this island,

27:25.311 --> 27:26.145
I think you'll find
that people know

27:26.245 --> 27:27.646
I am wound just right.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.421
Some of the guys--
they mentioned a dispute

27:35.521 --> 27:36.956
about the fire in Niger
that got you

27:37.056 --> 27:38.725
that Navy and
Marine Corps medal.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.059
You mean Kane?

27:40.159 --> 27:41.427
Why would you think that?

27:41.527 --> 27:43.362
Dennison told me
he was going up to see him.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.597
Someplace up north.
He was acting all holy.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.666
Wonder why he didn't
mention that before.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.135
Kane isn't what he seems.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.703
You didn't answer
Agent Holman's question.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.439
They made it look
like he left voluntarily.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.507
All right? But he was
a danger to the unit.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.309
He couldn't handle
being in country.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.212
And I didn't tell you because
Dennison decided a long time ago

28:00.312 --> 28:01.748
that he was gonna
cover for the guy.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.149
It was his choice.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.184
Now it seems like you guys
are looking for

28:05.284 --> 28:06.452
somebody else to blame.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.253
No.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.921
No, just the truth.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.157
Is that yours?

28:12.424 --> 28:13.492
Yeah.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.396
Mind if we take it?

28:17.496 --> 28:19.465
Do you really think
that I'd keep the bat

28:19.565 --> 28:21.901
if I beat someone
to death with it?

28:22.001 --> 28:23.269
Not sure.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.575
But I'm gonna take it anyway.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.378
Okay.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.056
Hey. You were
looking for me?
Yeah.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.324
Half hour ago.
What took you so long?

28:45.424 --> 28:47.093
This is both far
from the office

28:47.193 --> 28:48.527
and underground.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.029
And the couple people
I asked for directions

28:50.129 --> 28:51.530
were confused about
where you were.

28:51.630 --> 28:52.464
Or who you were.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.766
That's the way I like it.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.267
Anyway...

28:55.367 --> 28:57.069
I took all the information
you had in your files

28:57.169 --> 28:58.871
and created a schematic
of the fire.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.272
This is obviously the house.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.273
That looks right.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.274
I did a hand-drawn version

29:02.374 --> 29:03.275
when I visited the scene.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.476
Yep, it was excellent.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.778
Thank you.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.279
Except for the complete
lack of detail.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.219
Took me forever
to find this photo.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.521
An aid worker posted it
to a social media account

29:15.621 --> 29:17.223
a year before the
building burned down.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.590
That's it there.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.494
What do you see?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.196
Well, the street's
on the other side,

29:24.296 --> 29:26.698
so the door's over there.

29:27.466 --> 29:31.137
This is the back
and Kane would've been here.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.574
He wasn't near a window.

29:36.542 --> 29:39.578
He couldn't have seen
Baxter start the fire.

29:39.678 --> 29:40.880
Who's that?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.384
Corporal Nadiya Grange.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.020
Part of the Cultural
Support Team.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.388
She's your witness.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.758
Brother Kane is
covering for her.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.695
Hey, Ernie.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.697
Hey. We need to talk
about Niger.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.666
Yeah, well, we just
got back, so...

30:00.766 --> 30:03.802
I know. We're looking
right at you.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.605
Then why are we talking
on the phone?

30:10.776 --> 30:11.677
One, two,

30:11.777 --> 30:13.445
three.
Ah.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.683
Nadiya Grange
is your real witness.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.518
Brother Kane is just
her mouthpiece.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.054
Heading back to K-Bay
to pick her up.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.390
Don't bother.
I already called.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.393
Nadiya hasn't been
seen since yesterday.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.933
So maybe getting rid
of the real witness

30:34.033 --> 30:35.634
is why Baxter called in sick.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.178
According to the Black Diamonds,
Nadiya headed off base alone.

30:46.278 --> 30:47.679
Said she needed to
go to the drugstore

30:47.779 --> 30:49.949
for some
personal items.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.650
Bet that shut down
follow-up questions.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.152
How'd she travel?

30:53.252 --> 30:56.188
Got a car out of the motor
pool, it's still missing.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.926
The motor pool.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.164
Dennison rented a car to go to
the monastery and the beach,

31:05.264 --> 31:06.899
but we came up empty
on ride services

31:06.999 --> 31:09.435
and rental cars for our killer.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.602
Maybe...

31:10.702 --> 31:12.271
Baxter took a car from base. Yes.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.040
Go see if you can find
out which one

31:14.140 --> 31:15.908
and if there are any forensics
that tie to our dead captain.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.477
Okay.

31:22.648 --> 31:23.549
Kane.

31:23.649 --> 31:24.650
Where's Nadiya?

31:24.750 --> 31:26.285
Excuse me?
You're hiding her.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.920
She was the one that took off
into the woods last night.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.688
How did...?
We don't have
time for this.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.691
We know you didn't see Master
Sergeant Baxter set the fire,

31:32.791 --> 31:33.692
Nadiya did.

31:33.792 --> 31:34.961
I can't talk...

31:35.061 --> 31:36.963
She's not on base.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.400
I set her up at an outbuilding
on the edge of the property.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.269
Show me.

31:45.871 --> 31:46.772
Corporal?

31:46.872 --> 31:48.507
Yes, sir?

31:48.607 --> 31:50.376
I'm with NCIS.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.011
Sergeant Westmore, CID.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.445
We need you to get us
some motor logs.

31:53.545 --> 31:54.446
Yes, Sergeant.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.847
What do you need?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.516
Two days ago,
looking for any car

31:57.616 --> 31:59.385
Master Sergeant Baxter
signed out.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.055
I'll need to talk to my CO.
No, you don't.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.590
We're investigating a murder

32:04.690 --> 32:06.993
and we are requesting
evidence related to it.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.627
We don't need
anyone's permission.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.296
I just think it would be a...

32:10.396 --> 32:12.598
You will not go shields up
on me, Marine.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.133
I'm not an outsider.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.968
I'm a Marine CID
with a job to do.

32:16.068 --> 32:16.969
Just like you.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.070
Master Sergeant Baxter...

32:18.170 --> 32:21.440
Is an ass, Corporal. We know.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.710
Look, there is not gonna
be any blowback to you.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.180
Or your CO, not if we
all do our jobs.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.551
I'll be right back.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.520
Double-time it, Corporal.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.492
I love being a Marine.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.568
<i>I get why you and Nadiya would
be targets, but why Dennison?</i>

32:49.668 --> 32:52.071
Nadiya was too afraid
of Baxter to come forward

32:52.171 --> 32:53.872
with what she saw in Niger.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.041
So I said that I would.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.942
But when Dennison
looked into it,

32:57.043 --> 32:58.610
no one would
corroborate my story.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.347
Because they didn't know or
because they were afraid of him?

33:01.447 --> 33:02.381
Maybe both.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.651
So I called CID and I resigned.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.053
A few months later, I came here.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.854
Why wasn't that
the end of the story?

33:08.954 --> 33:11.290
Me saying that
Baxter was dirty

33:11.390 --> 33:13.925
created a new prism
for Dennison.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.495
Everything that
Baxter said or did

33:16.595 --> 33:18.530
seemed wrong,
so Dennison

33:18.630 --> 33:19.798
started to
believe my story.

33:19.898 --> 33:21.300
Nadiya's story
was true.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.203
Ah, so he was gonna reopen
the CID investigation.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.337
Yeah.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.806
But he wanted to talk
to Baxter first.

33:27.906 --> 33:30.342
Give him a chance
to come clean.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.914
I told Dennison about Nadiya.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.449
And as soon as
his car drove away,

33:37.549 --> 33:39.151
I realized that
I put her in danger.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.587
So I called her
and I told her to come hide.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.855
I should've stopped Dennison
from confronting him.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.992
All right, well, let's get
Nadiya safely back to Pearl.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.327
After that...

33:48.427 --> 33:51.163
Baxter will get
what's coming to him.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.066
We processed the car
Baxter signed out,

33:54.166 --> 33:55.501
we found
trace evidence.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.669
Blood and wood consistent
with the baseball bat.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.605
Forensics says the bat
we gave them was clean.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.207
No way to prove it was
the murder weapon.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.842
The chain of evidence to
the motor pool vehicle

34:03.942 --> 34:05.111
is a problem, too.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.678
Other people used it
after Baxter.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.013
Still, if the blood in the car

34:08.114 --> 34:09.748
is a DNA match
to Captain Dennison,

34:09.848 --> 34:11.150
that, along with
Nadiya's testimony,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.884
is a strong circumstantial case.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.353
Solid enough for JAG.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.955
I'm headed to the monastery
to help out Jesse.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.424
You two go pick up Baxter.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.058
Copy.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.533
Nadiya.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.039
Get down!

34:51.523 --> 34:52.591
Is there a window in that shack?

34:52.691 --> 34:53.625
Yeah, on the other side.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.161
All right, I'll cover you.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.628
Get in the door, get Nadiya
back to the monastery.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.697
You'll run out of bullets,
I promise you.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.799
Baxter won't.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.502
He will kill you.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.603
I'll give you as much time
as I can.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.771
Let me cover you. No.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.173
This is my job. Go.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.441
But this is my fault.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.977
I ran away. I cannot
run away again.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.548
Okay.

35:16.648 --> 35:17.849
Let's try something else then.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.216
Drop your weapon!

36:16.642 --> 36:18.277
Get her back to the monastery.

36:18.377 --> 36:21.012
I'll get the bastard.
I'm going with you.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.282
Let's go, Brother.
Man's got a job to do.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.585
God watch over you, Jesse.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.792
Damn it.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.389
Nope.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.224
Double nope.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.293
Ah...

37:50.702 --> 37:52.404
I was scared.

37:53.339 --> 37:56.041
I saw how he treated
people in country

37:56.141 --> 37:58.176
and I had no expectation
he would treat me differently.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.678
What Brother Kane told me.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.713
Is that what you saw?
Yes.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.915
Through the window,
I saw Master Sergeant Baxter

38:04.015 --> 38:05.884
pour cooking fuel
over the furniture

38:05.984 --> 38:08.554
and fabric in the house
and set it on fire.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.022
Was anyone from
the unit with him?

38:11.122 --> 38:12.190
No.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.992
He told us to
cover the exits.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.994
And keep the other villagers
from approaching.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.799
Soon as I realized what was
happening, I yelled "Fire."

38:20.899 --> 38:22.033
But when I got to the door,

38:22.133 --> 38:23.735
he was coming out
with two children.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.238
And directing other Marines
to come back to get the others.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.442
They got
everyone, except...

38:30.542 --> 38:32.043
The young man
who had given him

38:32.143 --> 38:34.646
a hard time and his mother.

38:34.746 --> 38:35.981
Baxter claimed
the kid set the blaze

38:36.081 --> 38:38.750
as soon as he stepped
in the house.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.452
I'm so sorry, Kane.

38:41.353 --> 38:43.455
I put you in
a terrible position.

38:43.555 --> 38:46.892
And now Captain Dennison
is dead because of me.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.360
People are
dead because

38:48.460 --> 38:50.529
of Sergeant Baxter.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.530
Thanks to the three of you,

38:51.630 --> 38:53.031
he's gonna go to trial

38:53.131 --> 38:54.900
and be put in prison
for the rest of his life.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.536
That doesn't do
any of them any good.

38:57.636 --> 38:58.604
No.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.072
But it's what we can do now.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.583
Did your hearing check out okay?

39:11.683 --> 39:13.785
After that grenade?
What's that?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.387
I'm kidding, it's fine.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.324
I just wanted to say thank you.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.892
If it wasn't for you
and your team,

39:20.992 --> 39:22.360
I might've spent
the rest of my life

39:22.461 --> 39:26.898
trying to make penance for...
for running away.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.934
And it never would have
been enough.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.703
I'm not so sure.
I think eventually,

39:31.803 --> 39:33.338
like those honeybees of yours,

39:33.439 --> 39:34.640
you would have found
your way home.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.308
Yeah, maybe.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.010
And I'm gonna pray
for you, Jesse.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.481
That you find the peace
that you crave as well.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.850
Thanks.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.452
But, uh, I'm fine.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.153
Mm-mm.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.288
There's a darkness
behind your smile.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.991
I see it.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.894
And I'm pretty sure
others see it as well.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.697
I don't know why
it's there, but...

39:58.797 --> 40:00.231
I bet you do.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.035
Take care.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.941
St. Benedict.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.511
You got to go
with your mascot.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.280
May I?

40:21.219 --> 40:24.456
Grant Jesse, Lord God,
a vision of the world

40:24.556 --> 40:29.227
where peace is built on justice,
and justice on love.

40:29.327 --> 40:33.098
Give Jesse the courage to work
toward this vision for himself

40:33.198 --> 40:36.034
and all of Your creation.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.837
Amen.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.075
Amen.

41:00.325 --> 41:01.727
So...

41:01.827 --> 41:02.928
where you off to next?

41:03.028 --> 41:06.231
Back to Gitmo, then who knows?

41:06.331 --> 41:07.766
Okay.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.200
Well, we would be
happy to have you

41:09.300 --> 41:11.336
back at Pearl anytime.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.674
Hey.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.275
Wait.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.544
You almost
forgot these.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.978
That's okay.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.747
I always like to leave
a pair of combat boots

41:21.847 --> 41:23.381
wherever I solve a case.

41:24.916 --> 41:25.817
Really?

41:25.917 --> 41:28.319
No.

41:32.824 --> 41:37.128
Hey. You're vertical.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.232
Feeling better. Sort of.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.606
No Cassandra?

41:48.574 --> 41:51.810
We broke up.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.444
Do you want
to talk about it?

41:53.545 --> 41:55.914
Not really. Okay.

41:57.716 --> 42:00.151
You've had
a rough couple days.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.655
She said we're
on different journeys.

42:03.755 --> 42:06.357
"Journeys."
I don't want to harvest
pineapples in Thailand.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.126
You know? A-And once
I'm in college,

42:08.226 --> 42:09.595
the time difference alone...

42:11.062 --> 42:12.898
Yeah. Just doesn't
make sense.

42:12.998 --> 42:15.200
Or make it easier.

42:17.468 --> 42:18.604
So, college, huh?

42:18.704 --> 42:20.338
Don't make it
weird, Mom. Okay.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.107
The investigators pressed Truman

42:22.207 --> 42:23.809
for information
about Darla's disappearance.

42:23.909 --> 42:27.245
But... to this day
Truman maintains

42:27.345 --> 42:29.547
his innocence
in Darla's disappearance.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.984
So, how much of a time
difference are we talking?
