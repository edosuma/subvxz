What in the world happened here?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.824
-This one tells it best.
-This one?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.994
-Mrs. Prows, this is Detective
Medavoy.
-How do you do?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.748
-I think this may have been my
fault.
-Really?

01:21.790 --> 01:24.709
The driver had to go to
the lavatory for a minute...

01:24.793 --> 01:28.463
and after he got off the bus,
I said to the man beside me...

01:28.505 --> 01:31.591
that when I'm late, my cat
does his business on the carpet.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.511
And he asked me where I live
and I told him and he just
went to the front of the bus

01:34.511 --> 01:38.098
and got in the driver's seat
and away we went.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.601
Uh, did he have liquor on his
breath, seemed like he might
have been on drugs?

01:41.684 --> 01:43.645
Well, he did have liquor
on his breath.

01:43.686 --> 01:48.191
When we were sitting next
to each other, he was
singing to himself–
Italian serenades.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.276
But he was very quiet and
polite.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.278
What did he look like?

01:52.320 --> 01:55.990
He was tall and lumbering,
with white hair...

01:56.032 --> 01:58.451
and like he could
lose 30 pounds.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.037
All right, thanks for your help,
Mrs. Prows.

he tried to take a
shortcut to my street.

One of the passengers said
he'd seen the guy that stole
the bus...

02:07.502 --> 02:10.672
-drinking a few days ago at
the, uh, Alibi Lounge.
-MEDAVOY: Oh, yeah?

Mother of God!
Look what he did to my bus!

Sir, please. The driver.
Sector car picked him up.

-John O'Neil. What in the hell
could have been in his mind?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.562
-It's wedged in pretty good.
-If you could try to collect
yourself, John...

take your statement,
what occurred.

Many's the occasion that
I've regretted my small
bladder capacity.

Then we'll get your account.

What's going on?

Your Internal Affairs Bureau
is going to talk to you about
the plate you ran for Joe
Salvo.

04:49.330 --> 04:53.334
My boss says you don't want
to tell I.A.B. it was your
request, which I got no
problem with.

-Who is gonna tell 'em?
-We don't want you to
cooperate with I.A.B.

04:58.047 --> 05:02.927
-Tends to piss 'em off.
-They think Salvo has a hook
in I.A.B.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.723
We'll give you one piece of
bad information for each of
your I.A.B. interviews...

05:06.806 --> 05:10.977

Bobby, right now,
you're in the middle of things.

05:29.495 --> 05:33.291
Yeah, which is a lot of
double-talk for “bite the

Gotta talk to my boss.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.390

caving the sides in...

didn't fit?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.357
Don't put words
in my mouth 'cause–

15:41.440 --> 15:43.359
We're not gonna put words
in your mouth, Steve...

15:43.442 --> 15:46.528
and we're not gonna put a fist
in your mouth and knock you
across the room...

15:46.570 --> 15:48.906
and have you spittin'
your teeth out like Chiclets.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.785
-We're not gonna do that.
-When we were in our locker
room just now, Steve...

15:52.868 --> 15:57.039
my partner says to me, uh,
“I think this super really
wants to cooperate.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.708
He's just a little afraid.”

15:59.750 --> 16:03.837
It's no crime
in being afraid, Steve.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.840
Especially if you've seen
something
that shakes you up inside.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.888
But now-now I have two–
my two new friends, right?

16:12.930 --> 16:18.060
So, I don't– I don't have to
be afraid no more.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.772
'Cause the rapist, the one at
large...

16:21.855 --> 16:24.108
once I tell you who he is...

16:25.943 --> 16:28.320
no– no chance
he don't go to jail.

16:28.404 --> 16:33.033
Right? Wind up back out on
the streets looking to hurt me.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
Right?

16:37.079 --> 16:41.041
I mean, there's no chance,
right, good buddies?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.260
Gary Wilder.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.722
B3.
(sighs)

16:56.348 --> 16:58.600
The other building
I'm the super at.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.069
-Hey, Gina.
-Hey.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.113
Let's talk in the coffee room,
Vince.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.323
Sure. Make it as public
as you can.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.785
-I'll be in in just a second.
-Yeah, while you run me down
for Fancy, right, Medavoy?

17:16.827 --> 17:18.787
Let's just get some coffee now,
Vince, all right?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.166
What's that?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.004
Vince Gotelli in a huge jackpot.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.339
He's who stole the bus?

17:29.381 --> 17:32.926
Driver steps off to piss,
Vince has had a few...

17:33.010 --> 17:34.928
I guess upset with
his health problems...

17:35.012 --> 17:37.514
decides he'll give the
passengers
door-to-door service.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.850
-Who knows about it?
-Nobody, boss.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.352
Did Telli show his shield
to get on?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.772
Driver made no mention of that.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.690
MEDAVOY:
We gotta bring I.A.B. in?

17:46.774 --> 17:50.194
Let me have the driver's name.
I'll see where it stands with
his supervisor.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.613
He's two months short
of 30 years, boss.

17:52.654 --> 17:56.700
-I don't need you telling me
that, Greg.
-Excuse me. Point taken.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.869
Is he sober enough
to give a statement?

17:58.952 --> 18:02.456
-We'll walk him through that.
-All right, take it, but don't
file it.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.883
I have a clean record.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.385
We put you through our
computer, Gary,
so we know that's true.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.305
Plus, if we didn't know it,
that's the 17th time you told
us.

18:18.388 --> 18:22.935
I'd like to know why someone
knocked out with
a migraine can be dragged out
of his bed...

18:23.018 --> 18:26.188
-without even knowing why
you want to talk to him.
-Ever happen with you, Gary...

18:26.271 --> 18:29.983
right off meeting someone,
you feel like he's a lying sack
of crap?

18:31.860 --> 18:35.322
You see any radio cars outside
your building this morning?

18:35.364 --> 18:37.950
You mean police cars?

18:38.826 --> 18:41.203
Police cars, right.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.832
I heard sirens. I was lying in
my bed
with the shades drawn.

18:44.873 --> 18:48.585
-Knocked out by your migraine?
-There was a robbery across
the street.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.713
Like I said, I–
I didn't see anything.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.299
Our thought was more you did it.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.597
-Well, you're wrong.
-If you did do it, Gary...

19:00.639 --> 19:03.100
which your photo's been picked
out
by several different
witnesses...

19:03.142 --> 19:06.687
-you're in a better way than
you deserve.
-Woman's gonna recover.

19:06.770 --> 19:10.065
You plead to the robbery,
probably do three years.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.402
I had a migraine, so I didn't
do anything.
Now I want a lawyer.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.238
Didn't have a migraine,
you'd have done it?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.451
Hope that didn't make
your headache worse.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.171
-Twitch super's in 3?
-Yeah. I'll put a photo array
together.

19:32.254 --> 19:36.008
One thing I don't want, he
throws up
on my shoes off his nervousness.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.351
-Hey.
-Hi.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.353
What's Gotelli doing in?

19:48.437 --> 19:51.648
-Uh, he hijacked that bus.
-What?

19:51.732 --> 19:55.152
-Yeah.
-Oh, man.

19:55.235 --> 19:59.656
-The Rat Squad's got it yet?
-Greg says Fancy's trying to
head that off.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.075
Maybe him and Vince
go further back.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.453
We gotta do something, Bobby.
I.A.B. will hang you out.

20:04.494 --> 20:08.081
If they see it's us doing
something,
they'll hang you out too.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.004
-I gotta do this photo array.
-I'm gonna take a pee.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.301
You know, when you grabbed
my wrist this morning, it hurt.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.261
Trained detective.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.310
You don't have his-his picture,
and now-now you do have his
picture.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.395
What does that mean,
he's in the building?

20:30.437 --> 20:33.732
I know this comes natural to
you,
Steve, try to relax.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.319
How's it going?

20:37.402 --> 20:40.155
Best day of my life.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.908
All right, tell us if you
recognize anyone,
and if so, from where?

20:44.618 --> 20:48.830
-Wilder's not in there.
-It's just us chickens in
here, Steve...

20:48.872 --> 20:51.458
but don't say a name until
you see a picture you recognize.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.837
That's Gary Wilder.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.799
Past being a tenant in one
of the buildings that you're a
super at...

20:58.882 --> 21:00.801
where do you recognize
that man from?

21:00.884 --> 21:04.888
Running from the apartment
where Sonja
Hudson was robbed and-and raped
and beaten.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.974
(sighs)

21:07.057 --> 21:09.393
Are you gonna arrest him?

21:09.434 --> 21:12.187
We're gonna work on that right
now.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.065
I'm not walking out of this
building
unless you put him under arrest!

21:15.148 --> 21:17.359
So you could become like
a station house mascot?

21:17.401 --> 21:20.195
Oh, oh, you're already showing
you don't care what happens to
me.

21:20.237 --> 21:24.283
-That's not true, Steve.
-Cameron, what you just did
took balls.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.953
And I respect you for it.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.207
We'll talk to the D.A. now.

21:35.752 --> 21:40.132
Cohen's riding. I saw him about
10 minutes ago heading for the
third floor.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.217
Yeah. Good.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.099
-What's that about?
-You got a minute for us,
Detective?

21:49.141 --> 21:52.602
-Yeah, sure.
-The, uh, coffee room's tied
up, Bobby.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.896
Well, all the interview rooms
are tied up then.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.733
Well, maybe you can take it
downstairs?

21:57.774 --> 21:59.609
-Sure.
-Okay.

22:07.159 --> 22:12.581
You got a minute, Cohen? Being
how no one else chooses to
converse with me.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.750
What's going on, Detective?

22:14.791 --> 22:18.128
I'm the last person
to ask about that.

22:18.211 --> 22:22.049
(clears throat) We got a
witness to the immediate
aftermath...

22:22.132 --> 22:24.843
picked the guy's photo out
for a robbery-sexual assault.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.179
Can you get the suspect
to stand in a lineup?

22:27.262 --> 22:30.640
Lawyered up.
Very strong I.D. from the
witness.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.352
He's a super. The perp's a
tenant
at one of his other buildings.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.562
Could the witness have made
the I.D. off some kind of
grudge?

22:35.562 --> 22:39.524
No. No. This– This guy didn't
want to get involved at all.

22:39.524 --> 22:43.070
He's scared out of his mind
the perp will make bail and
clean his clock.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.946
All right,
we'll file on the guy.

22:44.988 --> 22:47.657
Victim's on life support,
but they think she's going out.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.661
Can you get a high bail set off
the likelihood that the charge
goes to murder?

22:51.745 --> 22:54.873
I won't be at arraignment,
but, uh, I'll enter a note in
the file.

22:54.956 --> 22:58.668
-What's the collar's name?
-Gary Wilder.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.548
-I'm gonna go lock him up.
-All right.

23:04.216 --> 23:09.012
Uh, I'm worried
this mope witness
could get hurt.

23:09.054 --> 23:13.600
Would I piss you off asking
you to, uh, put the high bail
note in the file...

23:13.600 --> 23:15.685
and call the arraigning D.A.?

23:17.187 --> 23:21.608
If every fascist looked out
for victims and witnesses as
well as you do, Sipowicz...

23:21.650 --> 23:23.944
Bill of Rights issues would be
a lot more complicated.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.822
Hey, this day's going bad
enough.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.533
If I were you, I wouldn't be
making any wisecracks.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.246
(chuckles)

23:35.705 --> 23:38.208
For the record, Detective...

23:38.291 --> 23:41.336
have you been given your rights
and told that this
investigation...

23:41.378 --> 23:42.796
concerns your use
of department files...

23:42.796 --> 23:46.758
to obtain information about
a vehicle on loan to another
government agency?

23:46.842 --> 23:48.635
Yeah.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.388
Could you move closer
or raise your voice?

23:55.058 --> 23:58.061
Yes, I understand.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.481
Specifically,
you ran a covered plate.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.025
What's the question?

24:04.025 --> 24:07.237
Are you prepared to discuss
the circumstances or reasons
why you ran the plate?

24:07.237 --> 24:10.323
-No.
-And why is that?

24:10.699 --> 24:15.036
I ran the plate. I put in my
access number. I didn't try to
hide what I was doing.

24:15.036 --> 24:18.707
I'm asking what your intention
or purpose was in doing that.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.877
Find out who the plate
was issued to.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.172
(clicks off)

24:26.923 --> 24:28.800
(sighs)

24:28.800 --> 24:30.760
Are you gonna sit here
jerking me off?

24:30.760 --> 24:33.388
(scoffs)

24:39.102 --> 24:41.146
You know, Martens...

24:43.023 --> 24:45.525
I hope every day goes by...

24:45.567 --> 24:48.278
I learn something from someone.

24:48.361 --> 24:51.740
You told me something
maybe 18 months ago.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.910
-Definitely was my lesson for
that day.
-Which was what?

24:54.910 --> 24:58.038
“Everything's a situation.”

24:58.079 --> 25:00.582
I thought we had a relationship,
given the givens.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.043
I don't disagree with you.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.838
Which is why I'm reminding you
of the lesson you told me.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.090
How everything's a situation.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.846
Meaning you're in a situation
right now...

25:15.722 --> 25:18.808
you can't explain running that
plate.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.315
(sighs)

25:26.566 --> 25:29.444
That's not gonna be good
enough for my bosses, Simone.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.908
I'll have to go after you.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.707
You do what you gotta do.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.170
(sighs)

26:16.533 --> 26:19.452
Let me know if this is
how's it's gonna be. I'll
bring some books over.

26:20.870 --> 26:25.041
-You want the cover charge
back?
-Yeah, that's what I meant.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.377
(phone rings)

26:31.464 --> 26:34.759
Yeah. Yeah, how's it going?

26:36.219 --> 26:39.014
Uh, no, I'm working.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.643
I can't do that, Joe.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.566
Joe, how'd you get my phone?

26:49.608 --> 26:53.612
That right?
I'm gettin' forgetful.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.365
Yeah, good.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.619
Uh-huh. Take care.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.626
-How'd Salvo get your phone?
-I gave him the number.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.253
You did?

27:13.381 --> 27:16.384
Showing me his long reach.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.778
-Let's go in separate.
-Okay.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.467
I'm gonna have to beep
this nervous little twerp...

27:57.550 --> 27:59.969
and if I'm lucky enough
to find him...

28:00.053 --> 28:02.514
I'm gonna be standing
in three inches of piss.

28:02.555 --> 28:06.393
I don't want to hear how
anything
fell through the cracks, Cohen.

28:06.434 --> 28:09.562
You do what you say
or you don't.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.940
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Bring up the
note
that you put in his file.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.026
That'll have a real happy
outcome
for the both of us.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.278
I want to know
what the hell's going on.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.280
-Andy, I told you, I can't–
-You told me dick.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.866
Now these guys
are pulling your 61s.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.661
-That's my name on them things
too.
-Could I talk to you a minute?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.538
-Get a lawyer.
-Think he needs a lawyer?

28:26.621 --> 28:27.872
-Off the record?
-Sure.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.833
SIPOWICZ:
Kiss my male organ.

28:29.874 --> 28:33.128
-This will be off the record.
-Yeah. All right.

28:33.211 --> 28:37.424
In case you wanted to
know, that rape-assault?
Woman's dead. The perp
made bail.

28:37.465 --> 28:39.509
How did they give this guy
makable bail?

28:39.592 --> 28:42.595
How you gonna talk with
this jerk? He's looking to
hang you by your thumbs.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.014
Strange things occur.

28:56.401 --> 29:00.155
-Sorry about all that.
-Sure.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.240
Do you think we eat kids
for breakfast?

29:02.323 --> 29:06.745
I think humiliating the cop
is part of what you guys do
to try to soften him up.

29:06.786 --> 29:09.664
Shows what's in store for him
if he don't start helping
himself.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.667
Is that what you wanted to
tell me off the record?

29:12.751 --> 29:17.714
That plate you ran was covered
'cause it was part of an F.B.I.
operation.

29:17.756 --> 29:22.010
-And?
-And when we asked the agency
about it...

29:22.093 --> 29:25.597
-they can't release that
information.
-I can't release it either.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.808
You can't either
because you don't know...

29:28.892 --> 29:31.478
or because you're in a situation
you can't talk about?

29:31.519 --> 29:33.480
Is that what you were
trying to tell me yesterday?

29:33.563 --> 29:36.775
If I was in a situation,
I guess I'd be jamming
myself up answering your
question.

29:36.816 --> 29:41.446
Yeah, but you'd like to
if you could, hmm?

29:41.488 --> 29:43.948
You're getting caught in
the switches, aren't
you, Simone?

29:43.990 --> 29:48.912
I'd like not to have you
people going through my 61s
like I was some kind of thief.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.957
I'd like not to have
Andy Sipowicz up to
get screwed...

29:53.041 --> 29:55.460
just because he's my partner.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.552
My office is gonna hang you out.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.806
They'll find a mistake in your
61s...

30:07.889 --> 30:11.184
or trip you up on some
integrity test in the street.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.187
But that's not you.

30:14.312 --> 30:18.733
I know what the F.B.I. is doing.
I know they're looking at Joe
Salvo.

30:18.817 --> 30:23.321
-Now why don't they want my
office to know that?
-Ask the F.B.I.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.492
It ain't even in your mouth,
huh, Simone?

30:27.575 --> 30:29.994
Hook's right in your belly.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.124
I'm gonna work my shift.

30:44.217 --> 30:48.805
Don't answer his beeper. Don't
answer
any of the other four numbers
he gave me...

30:48.888 --> 30:51.182
till I thought he was never
leaving the station house.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.477
But his beeper,
that was 24 hours.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.272
That he sleeps with next to his
ear.
So I got that number.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.899
And I-I always got
contact with him.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.862
And now– now he don't answer,
and this asshole's on the
street.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.030
-Get those files off there!
-Easy, Andy.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.826
-That's a working detective's
desk, you asshole cheese-eater!
-Take it easy, Andy.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.453
How am I supposed to take
it easy, huh? There's rats
all over this office...

31:12.453 --> 31:15.039
this guy's in trouble, and
I don't know what the hell
is going on!

31:15.039 --> 31:18.126
-Control your man, Lieutenant.
-Don't tell me how to run my
office.

31:18.209 --> 31:22.505
-What are letting happen here,
huh?
-FANCY: That's enough.

31:23.882 --> 31:28.177
We gotta go look for
this super, and I don't
know if we're gonna
like what we find.

31:28.261 --> 31:32.557
-This is the rape-assault?
-Now it's a rape-homicide,
and maybe still counting.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.059
-We're going over to his
building.
-We'll want to be alert.

31:35.101 --> 31:39.272
Does anyone on the Rat Squad
follow us, catch us for
running red lights.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.444
-Are you Lieutenant Fancy?
-Yeah. What do you need?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.657
I'm Lou Garvey,
John O'Neil's boss.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.368
Oh, yeah.
We can talk in here.

32:07.508 --> 32:13.348
-How we doing on that bus?
-Well, um, we've got some
preliminary pieces put together.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.308
Um, riders' statements
and so forth.

32:15.391 --> 32:19.145
I thought you and I should talk
before we went much further.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.941
-Appreciate that consideration.
-Yeah. We've spoken with the
passengers.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.777
Except for the idiot
that hijacked the bus.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.947
Yeah, except for that idiot,
right.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.407
How's it add up for my guy?

32:31.449 --> 32:34.160
Well, let me put it this way,
Lou.

32:34.243 --> 32:40.124
I could put a lot of
manpower on this case,
possibly find a perpetrator.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.752
But whoever it is
prosecutes that case...

32:42.794 --> 32:47.382
has to involve the facts
coming out that your man made
an unauthorized stop.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.218
Failed to safeguard his bus.

32:50.301 --> 32:53.680
Now, I don't know how
it lays out at the
Transportation
Authority...

32:53.721 --> 32:58.017
but on my job, officer
gets hung, boss gets
strung up too.

32:58.059 --> 33:02.563
-I hear you.
-Other thing that concerns me,
the more gets made of this...

33:02.647 --> 33:06.192
I think the city's looking
at some kind of lawsuit
from those passengers.

33:06.275 --> 33:10.363
Oh.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.448
I hear you there too.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.909
As far as you know, has the
press gotten ahold of this?

33:14.993 --> 33:18.454
(chuckles)
No. I got that bus towed fast.

33:18.496 --> 33:22.291
I'm just thinking if low-key
isn't a better way to go.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.002
Hmm.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.590
Lieutenant, uh...

33:29.674 --> 33:34.137
I'm not opening your eyes none

33:34.220 --> 33:38.057
there's some real bad guys
out on our streets.

33:38.141 --> 33:41.185
It's not a shock to me,
Lou, no.

33:41.227 --> 33:44.689
With that element circulating
and, uh...

33:44.772 --> 33:49.193
thank God, no harm was done
with this bus prank...

33:49.277 --> 33:53.364
your people got better things
than to go after it like a
nuclear attack.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.034
I think we're on the same page,
Lou.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.995
Tell 'em they don't need to get
any hernias tracking this thing
down.

33:59.037 --> 34:03.332

It's good to meet you, Lou.

-Last I saw him was about
three hours ago.

basement.
-He's not here.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.040
We ought to look in

he went down there
three hours ago.

34:44.040 --> 34:48.169
Yeah, I heard her. I'm gonna go
see this asshole Wilder's
apartment.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.421
-We'll go there, then we'll
check the basement.
-You check the basement.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.341
I'll check his place.
I don't need your help.
