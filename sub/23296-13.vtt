02:06.919 --> 02:08.504

02:12.216 --> 02:14.551
I understand not wanting to
make a fuss our first year.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.678
We were depressed,

Last year--
- Less shock, deeper depression.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.724

02:20.724 --> 02:22.893
we were finally making
some headway.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.020
- Okay, so what exactly
is your proposal, then?

02:25.020 --> 02:29.483
- Well, I say we throw a party.
Just like the old days.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.693
Invite some people over,
sing some carols.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.695

Christmas Eve, right,

spend it like, caroling

02:35.447 --> 02:37.449

festive way

02:39.451 --> 02:41.870
to spend Christmas Eve,
than all of us pitching in.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.789

we're gonna pull this off

02:43.789 --> 02:46.291
without the grand piano,
or the ice sculptures.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.085
- Or the reindeer room.

is going to obliterate

02:50.462 --> 02:52.548

the point, Moira.

forward, not backward.

be unable to attend.

situation then,

forward through the holidays.

- I'm a delightful half-half
situation,

04:16.006 --> 04:17.716
which is why it's so annoying
that my Dad thinks

04:17.716 --> 04:19.676
he can boss people around
on a holiday

04:19.676 --> 04:21.845
that he technically
has no authority over.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.848

is feeling the most generous

04:24.848 --> 04:27.226
give me a discount on two cases
of wine, please?

are showing up to this thing?

afford Nate Berkus,

04:44.243 --> 04:45.994

in Ibiza.

decorations, then.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.064

they wouldn't be

05:14.064 --> 05:15.732
up to your standards.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.317

because at this point,

all of the leftovers to their
families on Christmas Day.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.772

exactly the same thing

05:55.772 --> 05:58.358
with my friends once.
But instead of cookies,

05:58.358 --> 05:59.568

05:59.568 --> 06:01.236

cabinets,

06:01.236 --> 06:02.779

party,

06:02.779 --> 06:04.740

in Krakow.

at the Krak-ow dawn,

06:07.618 --> 06:09.870
so that Alexis
could bake these cookies.

- Alexis didn't bake these
cookies, though.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.373
- Yeah, no, I know,
I just thought that

06:13.373 --> 06:15.417
we would say that you did,

06:15.417 --> 06:17.294
so that we could give you
a leg-up with my friends.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.297

with your friends?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.101
after the called-off
engagement...s.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.438
But, they have all agreed
to give you one last chance.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.023
- What?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.816
- I shouldn't have said one
last chance, I just meant like,

06:39.816 --> 06:41.485
one... more... final chance.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.322

up and I couldn't come?

06:50.577 --> 06:54.456

and back day?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.416
Rather not think about it.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.878
Wait... did something come up?
- No, no. Not at all.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.048
Um, my Dad just had this last
minute idea of um,

07:03.048 --> 07:05.217
throwing a Christmas party
tonight.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.803
- So something did come up?
I-I had thought that you said

07:07.803 --> 07:09.847
that your family doesn't
celebrate Christmas?

07:09.847 --> 07:11.682
- Well, we don't, normally.

what he's thinking.

you from your family.

I do want to meet your cool,
scary, judgy friends,

07:21.525 --> 07:24.444
and the last thing I wanna do
is cause you any trouble.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.448
So, why don't you just double
this cookie recipe,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.868
and we'll drop a batch off
to my parents on our way?

07:30.868 --> 07:34.663

Now that was festive.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.530
Well, obviously we'll be
looking at something

08:08.530 --> 08:10.199

08:37.559 --> 08:39.269
I meant higher price,
because of demand.

in private, for a minute?

You know, in the old days,
I stood by your side

09:26.441 --> 09:28.610
no matter how you wanted
to spend the holidays.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.779
Whether it was heading to Miami

09:30.779 --> 09:33.824
for Puff Daddy's Poolside
White Party,

09:33.824 --> 09:37.244
or that uncomfortable tree
trimming at Arnold and Maria's.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.413
How 'bout the night you
wore your fur coat

09:39.413 --> 09:42.082
to the PETA Christmas
Fundraiser?

09:42.082 --> 09:45.210
- I hear Peter Fundraiser.
Bogdanovich loved a mink.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.213
- Well, I'd love it if you
could just be a little more

09:48.213 --> 09:50.174
on-board with all of this.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.594
- Okay, John, for you.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.262
And Christmas.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.472
- Okay, thank you, Moira. Ray?

10:00.851 --> 10:03.228
- How's it looking, Moira?
Is it straight?

10:03.228 --> 10:05.105
- Oh, straight as an arrow.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.024
- Ah, good.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.818
Oh, David, Stevie.
- That tree's not straight.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.404
- Huh? No, no, no,
it's pretty straight.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.407
Let's see what we got here.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.744
Lights.

10:18.744 --> 10:22.539
We're missing a lot of bulbs,
but, we'll make do.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.876
What else?

10:25.876 --> 10:27.920
What's this, a pumpkin?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.130
- Perhaps a Christmas gourd.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.007
- It's not a Christmas gourd,
Moira.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.259
- I know, John, but you
requested I get on board.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
That was me getting on board.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.471
- David, what's going on here?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.556
This, this stuff is garbage.

10:39.556 --> 10:44.269
- Um, it's Stevie's
grandmother's decorations?

10:44.269 --> 10:47.189
- And by garbage, Stevie,
you know, I...I mean...

10:48.607 --> 10:51.109
- Oh, no, no, no.
It's... it's bad.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.279
- What's this?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.697
- Those would be Mardi Gras
beads.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.574
Nana Bud worked real
hard for those.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.451
- So we're getting warmer.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.246
- This is all you could find,
David? You own a store!

11:02.246 --> 11:03.747
Where...where are all
the decorations

11:03.747 --> 11:05.874
that you sell in your store?

11:05.874 --> 11:09.670
- Um...they're at the store,
being sold.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.588
I couldn't just bring
everything home,

11:11.588 --> 11:14.675
just because you wanted to have
a party at the last minute.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.468
We're saving for stuff.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.428
- Oh, well that's very
responsible.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.390
- What are you saving for?
- An... espresso machine.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.183
- You're selling coffee now?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.103
- Hmm... it's more for the staff
room.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.188
- I'm gonna just go
get that wine.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.357
- It's for the staff room?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.568
So you couldn't bring home
decorations for your family

11:32.568 --> 11:35.028
on Christmas because
you're saving money

11:35.028 --> 11:37.573
for a coffee maker
for yourself?

11:37.573 --> 11:39.575
- I believe he said espresso
machine.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.076
- You're not helping, Moira.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.495
- (Gasps) What is everybody
yelling about?

11:43.495 --> 11:45.330
- Well, we have a Christmas
tree,

11:45.330 --> 11:48.625
but no decorations because your
brother's a cheap-ass!

11:48.625 --> 11:51.253
And right now we have the most
un-Christmassy looking room,

11:51.253 --> 11:54.214
that'll soon be filled
with party guests...

11:54.214 --> 11:57.551
speaking of, how's the guest
list coming, Alexis?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.553
- I don't know, you tell me!

11:59.553 --> 12:01.054
- Why would I tell you?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.806
You were in charge
of the guest list!

12:02.806 --> 12:04.808
- Well, it's hard to be in
charge of the guest list,

12:04.808 --> 12:06.143
if no one's given it to me yet.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.687
- Why would anybody give it
to you?

12:08.687 --> 12:10.355
You were in charge
of making it!

12:10.355 --> 12:13.483
- Making it? I thought you
wanted me to handle it?

12:13.483 --> 12:15.194
Like, work the door,

12:15.194 --> 12:17.446
make sure nobody gets in
that isn't on the list!

12:17.446 --> 12:19.531
- It's Christmas Eve, Alexis!

12:19.531 --> 12:23.452
Who's going out crashing other
people's Christmas parties?

12:23.452 --> 12:25.245
(Knock on door, door opens)

12:25.245 --> 12:27.122
- Ugh!
- Knock! Knock!

12:27.122 --> 12:29.833
Any room left at the inn?
- (Chuckles)

12:29.833 --> 12:32.336
- I hope you guys all like
gingerbread.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.962
- Oh, you're too sweet.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.423
- Oh no, it was the least
we can do,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.008
just sorry that we couldn't
stick around for the party
tonight.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.053
- What's that?
- You didn't tell him?

12:41.053 --> 12:44.431
- Oh, my god.
- Okay, I hate this!

12:44.431 --> 12:47.309
- I opened red, I hope that's
okay with everyone?

12:47.309 --> 12:49.561
- Alexis, I thought we agreed
that you and Ted

12:49.561 --> 12:51.146
would be coming here tonight?

12:51.146 --> 12:53.357
I know, but Ted's friends
are having a thing,

12:53.357 --> 12:55.275
and everyone low-key hates me.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.985
- Uh, hate is a strong word.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.029
- Do you know what I think
might put this jolly trolley

12:59.029 --> 13:01.782
back on track?
The release of the tree.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.617
- Are you kidding me, Moira?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.452
I don't see much point
in doing that now.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.163
- No, release it.
Alexis: Yes.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.082
And I'll put the jerry
beads on the tree.

13:10.082 --> 13:12.209
- We're not putting Mardi Gras
beads

13:12.209 --> 13:13.877
on a Christmas tree, Alexis!

13:13.877 --> 13:16.380
- John, please, do the honours.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.466
(Alexis gasps)

13:19.466 --> 13:21.385
(All clap)

13:23.428 --> 13:25.389
- Yay.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.439
(Scissors snap)

13:37.442 --> 13:39.027
(Branches clank)

13:47.744 --> 13:51.206
- W-- I, for one,
find it charming,

13:51.206 --> 13:54.751
in sort of a...
a war-torn sort of way.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.008
- If we rotate it?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.718
- Allow me.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.928
I can do that. I'll just...

14:04.928 --> 14:06.471
No, no, actually we don't wanna
do that.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.432
Looks like the other side has
been charred, or something.

14:08.432 --> 14:12.853
- Um, what if we cut it up
and turned it into garlands?

14:14.021 --> 14:17.566
- Why don't we just cut it
up for firewood?

14:17.566 --> 14:20.736
No this, this was a really
stupid idea,

14:20.736 --> 14:22.905
a little Christmas party.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.282
Something to temporarily
take our minds off things.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.910
But clearly this was
too much for all of you.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.497
And you're right, why start
making an effort now?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.166
- John?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.834
- I'm gonna take a walk.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.839
It's meatloaf night
at the cafe,

14:40.839 --> 14:42.966
and if anything is screaming
Christmas to me right now,

14:42.966 --> 14:44.968
it's meatloaf.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.057
(Door opens and closes)

14:53.185 --> 14:55.729
- Okay...I didn't wanna say
anything,

14:55.729 --> 14:58.524
but meatloaf night
was yesterday.

14:58.524 --> 15:00.108
- Dear God, I...

15:04.863 --> 15:06.865
- Night.
- Good night.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.825
(Dishes clink)

15:08.825 --> 15:12.412
David? Alexis?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.123
("O Christmas Tree" plays)

15:16.625 --> 15:19.461
Moira, have you seen the kids?
- Whose kids?

15:19.461 --> 15:21.922
- Our kids?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.843
- That ship sailed hours ago,
dear.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.886
Literally, Alexis and Stavros

15:27.886 --> 15:29.680
are on his father's yacht
by now.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.640
Off to Capri.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.724
- Ah. And David?

15:34.268 --> 15:37.896
- Hm, David, last I heard
he was screaming at Wolfgang.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.523
Apparently there weren't
enough capers

15:39.523 --> 15:43.026
on the smoked salmon crudites.
- Ah.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.573
I thought we could...
open presents tonight.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.992
- Oh don't worry, I already
gave them their cheques.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.415
- Quite something, isn't it?
- Hmm.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.879
- All this?
- Yeah.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.551
- Moira, come stand here
with me for a minute.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.178
- John, you know I would,

16:09.178 --> 16:11.471
but I've already taken
my Christmas pills,

16:11.471 --> 16:13.682
and bitter experience
has taught me

16:13.682 --> 16:16.727
I have just 8 minutes to make
it safely up the stairs.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.729
(Blows air kiss)

16:21.523 --> 16:23.192
(Piano plays)

16:25.194 --> 16:27.779
Woman's Voice: Mr. Rose?

16:27.779 --> 16:30.073
Twyla: Mr. Rose!

16:30.073 --> 16:32.075
Can I take your plate?

16:32.075 --> 16:34.286
- Oh, yes, yes, Twyla,

16:34.286 --> 16:36.079
and please, thank the kitchen
for the meatloaf.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.165
I could've sworn
it was Wednesdays.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.375
- It's always been Tuesdays.
- Oh.

16:41.752 --> 16:44.379
- Is everything okay, Mr. Rose?

16:44.379 --> 16:46.548
- Why wouldn't it be,
it's Christmas Eve?

16:46.548 --> 16:49.009
- And yet, here you are,
eating yesterday's meatloaf.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.181
- Hi, John.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.682
- Moira.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.851
- Twyla, thank you.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.977
I hope he didn't keep you
too late.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.896
I'm sure you have somewhere
to be.

17:00.896 --> 17:03.774
- Actually, I do, but you guys
take as long as you want.

17:03.774 --> 17:07.819
George will lock up.
- Merry Christmas, Twyla.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.030
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Rose.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.323
Dinner is on us.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.116
(Footsteps thud)

17:16.662 --> 17:19.164
- Well, this isn't right,
you sitting here alone.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.086
- Oh, I don't know,
it feels pretty familiar.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.421
- Yes, I guess we've
established

17:26.421 --> 17:29.842
a pretty grim tradition
these past few years.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.261
- Well, I'm not talking about
these past few years,

17:32.261 --> 17:33.971
I was talking
about the old days.

17:35.931 --> 17:39.101
Do you even remember
how those big,

17:39.101 --> 17:41.395
lavish Christmas parties used
to end?

17:41.395 --> 17:43.605
- I think that's the sign
of a successful soiree,

17:43.605 --> 17:45.899
if you don't.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.570
- I'd find myself standing
alone,

17:49.570 --> 17:50.821
staring at the tree,

17:51.864 --> 17:54.199
and all I'd want,

17:57.953 --> 18:02.124
I just thought, in spite
of all the hardship that...

18:05.002 --> 18:07.254
we found ourselves coming
together,

18:07.254 --> 18:09.339
the kids, you, and me,
as a family.

18:11.049 --> 18:14.219
And it just seemed like the
perfect day to celebrate that.

18:16.263 --> 18:20.225
The perfect day for a Rose
Family Christmas Party.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.227
- John, I'm sorry.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.647
On behalf of the children,

18:25.647 --> 18:27.858
for myself, I'm sorry, John.

18:27.858 --> 18:31.236
We didn't fully understand
why this party

18:31.236 --> 18:33.363
was so important to you.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.365
- Well, doesn't matter now.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.870
- No, guess we should
get a move on.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.124
- Ah, uh uh.

18:46.877 --> 18:48.921
Oh, there's no booze in that!

18:48.921 --> 18:50.797
Ew!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.216
Ew!

18:56.845 --> 18:58.430
(Footsteps crunch in the snow)

18:59.932 --> 19:03.894
Hm, the one nice thing about
living in this desolate,

19:03.894 --> 19:06.313
lonely place, is it can,

19:06.313 --> 19:08.565
at times, be quite peaceful.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.692
- Well, it wasn't too peaceful
this afternoon,

19:10.692 --> 19:12.152
I'm sorry to say.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.321
- Oh, nah, it wouldn't be
the holidays

19:14.321 --> 19:16.532
without at least one good
family fight.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.159
- No, but what was I thinking,
Moira?

19:19.159 --> 19:21.411
Springing this party idea
on everyone

19:21.411 --> 19:24.122
was a little last minute.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.006
- It appears there's been
a Christmas miracle, John.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.223
All: Merry Christmas!

19:43.016 --> 19:45.394
("Jingle Bells" plays)

19:45.394 --> 19:46.979
(Low hum of chatter)

19:46.979 --> 19:49.231
- Merry Christmas, John.
- Oh.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.237
Oh, David!

19:56.738 --> 19:59.366
Is this the same tree?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.201
- Uh, theoretically.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.537
We have spent a very long time
gluing it back together.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.372
- Scary amount of super glue.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.207
- Seriously, nobody should
light a match in here.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.501
- Mm hmm.
- And...

20:09.501 --> 20:11.545
everyone chipped in.

20:11.545 --> 20:14.590
And there might have been a few
things leftover at the store.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.508
So...

20:16.508 --> 20:18.594
- Who wants bubbly?
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Rose.

20:18.594 --> 20:21.430
- Merry Christmas, Dad.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.307
You know I hate to miss
a good party.

20:23.307 --> 20:26.935
- See? I knew you could handle
a guest list.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.812
- And um, just a heads up,

20:28.812 --> 20:30.731
Ted's vet friends are coming
by later,

20:30.731 --> 20:33.567
and I have a sneaking suspicion
they're a little bit...

20:33.567 --> 20:35.944
But, hmm.
- (Small chuckle)

20:38.614 --> 20:40.282
- Room looks good.
- Mm hmm.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.452
You still thinking about that
espresso machine, aren't ya?

20:43.452 --> 20:44.912
- Yes. Yes, I am.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.749
- One day.
- Mm hmm.

20:48.749 --> 20:51.543
- Hey, Johnny, Merry Christmas.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.253
- Merry Christmas, Roland.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.506
Little last minute, this little
party of yours, huh?

20:55.506 --> 20:58.133
- Well, it seems last minute
turned into last second.

20:58.133 --> 21:01.345
- Well, all I'm saying is,
next time um,

21:01.345 --> 21:04.640
I'd appreciate my invitation
about a week in advance, okay?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.600
- Well, if I have things
my way,

21:06.600 --> 21:08.894
we'll be making this an annual
tradition,

21:08.894 --> 21:10.938
so you can save the date now.

21:10.938 --> 21:12.272
- No, that's way too far
in advance,

21:12.272 --> 21:13.774
I can't make that kinda
commitment.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.692
- Okay, Roland.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.654
- Moira, it's so wonderful

21:18.654 --> 21:19.988
that you made this happen
for Johnny.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.323
- Yeah.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.825
- But, we were supposed
to be caroling

21:23.825 --> 21:26.328
at the senior's centre
30 minutes ago.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.830
- Oh, Jocelyn, surely the
dentures have been dropped in

21:28.830 --> 21:30.999
the glass by now.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.502
Can't we spare one carol here,
before we go?

21:33.502 --> 21:35.879
- Why not.
- Yes.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.297
Twyla?

21:38.549 --> 21:40.717
(Music ends)

21:40.717 --> 21:42.594

21:42.594 --> 21:45.180

Nothing's happening.

22:40.986 --> 22:42.738
- Looks like you're crying.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.948
- Oh well, I'm not.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.408
It's just we're...

22:47.951 --> 22:50.954
We ran out of red!
- Oh.

♪ Sleep in heavenly peace

22:55.918 --> 23:00.172

23:09.348 --> 23:13.435
- Anyone interested in opening
a gift tonight?

23:13.727 --> 23:15.979
- I thought you said
we weren't doing presents?

23:15.979 --> 23:19.691
- Well, you kids were so upset
about there being no presents,

23:21.693 --> 23:23.987
the Church had a small rummage
sale this morning,

23:23.987 --> 23:26.031
so I popped in.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.491
Close your eyes, Moira.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.078
Smaller, smaller, smaller.

23:33.247 --> 23:35.249
- A bomb?

23:35.249 --> 23:38.252
- No, it's an antique tin.
- Oh.

23:38.252 --> 23:40.295
- For your wig pins.
- Oh.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.339
David: Hmm.
- Ooh.

23:43.549 --> 23:46.134
- Little something for you,
Alexis.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.428
(Envelope rustles)

23:51.890 --> 23:54.059
- Stickers!

23:54.059 --> 23:56.770
Of old men!

23:56.770 --> 24:00.190
- No, they're stamps,
from all over the world.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.568
- David, I know you like
money...
- Yes.

24:02.568 --> 24:04.778
(Change clinks)

24:10.617 --> 24:13.161
- It's what looks like 1,000
Yen.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.664
- Yeah.

24:15.664 --> 24:19.251
- Hm. It's like being right
back in Japan.

24:19.251 --> 24:22.838
- Okay, okay, let's just smile
and say thank you.

24:22.838 --> 24:24.006
Thank you.

24:25.424 --> 24:28.552
- Oh, you know, reminds me,

24:28.552 --> 24:30.387
I was worried about
this menorah

24:30.387 --> 24:31.430
being so close
to the garland.

24:31.430 --> 24:34.558
Last thing we want is to
have the motel burn down.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.727
- Or is it?
- What?
