00:43.913 --> 00:45.088
Just one sec.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.698
Hasta El Fuego.
Please hold.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.744
Okay.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.137
This way.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.708
Here you are.
Your server
will be right with you.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.669
Hey, Jason.

01:00.843 --> 01:01.887
Hey.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.325
Hi. Do you know what you want?

01:04.499 --> 01:05.413
- Uh, yeah.
- Cool.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.805
Thanks.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.071
Hi!

01:42.928 --> 01:43.973
Um...

01:46.149 --> 01:47.281
Okay.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.500
- Another shot?
- Yeah, sure. Okay. Um...

01:53.374 --> 01:54.940
Hi. Hi, Reggie.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.203
<i>Laura, hi.</i>

01:56.377 --> 01:59.510
Hello. <i>Um, so nice to phone-meet you</i>

01:59.684 --> 02:01.164
<i>in this
incredibly embarrassing way.</i>

02:01.338 --> 02:04.385
Oh, you know, no-- no problem.
It's fine.

02:04.559 --> 02:07.518
<i>This is what I get
for picking a trendy place
with no sign out front, huh?</i>

02:09.303 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, why do they do that here? <i>I don't know.</i>

02:11.174 --> 02:13.133
<i>I've only been in the city
for a few months.</i>

02:13.307 --> 02:15.352
Me, too! No way! Yeah. <i>Oh, wow.</i>

02:15.526 --> 02:18.094
Well, um,
it's a very cool restaurant.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.618
Is it on Hudson? <i>Yes.</i>

02:20.792 --> 02:23.186
<i>Am I on Hudson?</i> I don't know.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.275
<i>I am not on Hudson. Shit.</i>

02:26.885 --> 02:28.887
<i>Uh, I am now
walking towards Hudson.</i>

02:29.061 --> 02:30.759
Okay. <i>I am so, so sorry.</i>

02:30.933 --> 02:32.326
<i>This is not
the first impression
I wanted to make</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:33.718
<i>on a college professor.</i>

02:33.892 --> 02:35.590
Oh, pfft. Associate Professor,

02:35.764 --> 02:37.679
and it's just
Film Studies, so...

02:37.853 --> 02:39.637
<i>Oh.</i>...you're safe.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.466
<i>Film Studies? That's...</i>
<i>...cool.</i>

02:42.640 --> 02:45.817
You say that,
but try teaching a class
on 20th-century slashers

02:45.991 --> 02:47.863
to a heap
of hungover 19-year-olds.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.865
<i>Slashers, huh?</i>

02:50.039 --> 02:52.128
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

02:52.302 --> 02:54.174
Um, not that one.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.525
<i>So why slashers?</i>

02:57.699 --> 02:59.875
Well, I just, you know,
I think it's interesting.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.051
You can really examine
the culture of the moment

03:02.225 --> 03:03.661
by looking at
the tropes of the time.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.882
Like, um, the masked killer,
the final girl,

03:07.056 --> 03:08.013
the different rules:

03:08.188 --> 03:10.973
Don't split up. Don't have sex.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.238
<i>Don't answer the phone.</i> Exactly, exactly, exactly.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.761
It's all cliché.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.633
But out of those clichés
comes an opportunity

03:18.807 --> 03:20.330
for outsider art.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.724
A voice for the voiceless,
you might say.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.552
<i>Mmm.</i>
Jesus Christ.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.771
<i>Yeah, I'm more of
a rom-com guy,
to be honest.</i>

03:26.945 --> 03:29.470
<i>Okay, I think I'm on Hudson.</i>

03:29.644 --> 03:31.080
Okay. <i>Um...</i>

03:31.254 --> 03:32.908
<i>What color is the outside
of the restaurant?</i>

03:33.082 --> 03:34.344
I-I think it's red.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.478
<i>I don't see anything red.</i>

03:37.652 --> 03:40.350
I, um-- I could be wrong.
Let me just, um...

03:40.524 --> 03:42.396
Let me go have
a little look-see.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.049
<i>Oh, okay. Thank you.</i>

03:46.356 --> 03:47.531
All right, um...

03:48.532 --> 03:50.447
Yep, it's definitely red.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.668
<i>Yeah, I'm not seeing
anything red here.</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:56.671
Sure you're on Hudson?

03:56.845 --> 04:00.196
<i>Um... Oh, crap,
I'm still a block over.</i>

04:00.370 --> 04:02.329
<i>It looks like there's
an alley I can cut through.</i>

04:02.503 --> 04:03.982
<i>Is the restaurant
near an alley?</i>

04:04.156 --> 04:05.723
Um...

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
Yes! Yes.
There is an alley.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.337
<i>Oh, perfect.
I'm coming down the alley.</i>

04:14.515 --> 04:15.646
I don't see you.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.562
<i>Wait. Really? Are you sure?</i>

04:18.736 --> 04:20.129
Uh...

04:22.305 --> 04:23.654
Let me just...

04:23.828 --> 04:27.310
<i>Uh, there are some dumpsters
about halfway down.</i>

04:28.180 --> 04:30.705
I see them,
but I don't see you.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
<i>Yeah, I don't see you, either.</i>

04:34.709 --> 04:36.928
<i>This is creepy, right?</i>

04:37.102 --> 04:39.061
Uh, a little bit.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.106
<i>20th-century slashers, huh?</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:43.413
Yeah. Are you sure you're
walking towards Hudson?

04:43.587 --> 04:45.110
<i>I'm sure.</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:47.852
<i>Oh, wait, I think I see you!
Can you wave?</i>

04:48.549 --> 04:49.811
Can you see me?

04:49.985 --> 04:52.814
<i>Uh, the person I'm looking at
isn't waving.</i>

04:52.988 --> 04:55.295
<i>They're just staring at me.</i>

04:55.991 --> 04:57.166
Are you sure?

04:58.385 --> 04:59.690
<i>Okay, this is weird.</i>

05:01.126 --> 05:04.304
<i>Um...
Now they're moving towards me.</i>

05:04.478 --> 05:05.348
Are you okay?

05:05.522 --> 05:07.350
<i>Shit. He's following me.</i>

05:07.524 --> 05:09.178
I don't see anybody.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.137
<i>Holy shit! He's after me!</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:13.356
Where are you?

05:13.530 --> 05:15.576
<i>He's got a knife!</i> What?

05:15.750 --> 05:18.187
<i>And that's not the worst part.</i>

05:18.361 --> 05:19.971
<i>The worst part is...</i>

05:20.145 --> 05:22.147
<i>...you teach a class
about slashers</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:25.194
<i>and you still walked
into a dark alley.</i>

05:25.368 --> 05:26.500
<i>Alone.</i>

05:26.674 --> 05:28.502
Okay, that's not funny.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.550
<i>No.</i>

05:34.551 --> 05:35.683
<i>It's not.</i>

06:08.324 --> 06:10.761
Now I see something red.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.209
Hey, girl, you look great!

07:12.257 --> 07:15.739
You're not wearing
a costume? Come on.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.394
No, I wouldn't
- have done that.
- Oh, hey. Tara!

07:18.568 --> 07:19.874
Jason.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.876
Are you and Greg gonna come
to the OKB party?

07:22.050 --> 07:24.705
Well, if he finishes his
Spanish project in time,
yes, we will.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.228
Is your sister coming?

07:26.402 --> 07:27.969
No, Sam wouldn't be caught dead
at a frat party.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.145
There's a first time
for everything.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.103
Not tonight, though.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.976
- Can't convince her?
- No. That's not my problem,
that's yours.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.457
- Save me a drink!
- All right.
I'll see you.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.906
Honey, I'm home!

07:56.563 --> 07:57.564
Greg?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.306
Greg?

08:35.079 --> 08:36.124
I'm sorry, okay?

08:36.298 --> 08:37.865
I--

08:38.039 --> 08:41.216
I just got massive blue balls,
and I-- I had to practice.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.914
Please don't be mad.
How mad are you?

08:45.220 --> 08:48.702
<i>Oh, I'm not mad, Jason.</i>

08:48.876 --> 08:50.225
Dude.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.357
We said we wouldn't
use the voice on each other.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.839
<i>We said a lot of things.</i>

08:56.013 --> 08:57.928
This is Greg, right?

09:00.627 --> 09:02.977
<i>Who else would it be?</i>

09:03.151 --> 09:05.762
Where are you?
I want to tell you about it.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.329
Oh, by the way,

09:07.503 --> 09:10.114
we should go to that frat party.
Tara's going.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.682
<i>What was it like?</i> Not on the phone, man.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.424
Seriously, turn off
the fucking voice modulator.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.818
<i>I'm just trying
to get the voice right.</i>

09:17.992 --> 09:20.864
<i>You got to have your practice,
I get mine.</i>

09:21.343 --> 09:22.431
Whatever.

09:22.605 --> 09:25.086
<i>Just tell me
what it felt like.</i>

09:26.087 --> 09:27.567
<i>Then maybe I'll come out.</i>

09:27.741 --> 09:29.133
Dude, I know
you're not here.

09:30.308 --> 09:31.396
<i>Humor me.</i>

09:31.571 --> 09:33.137
All right, fine.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.707
It was even better

09:37.881 --> 09:40.101
than we ever could have imagined.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.018
I mean,
when the knife went in her,

09:44.192 --> 09:48.718
it's like
she wasn't human anymore.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.633
Just an animal.

09:53.027 --> 09:56.117
And every time it went in,

09:56.291 --> 10:00.556
she was less and less human.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.515
And then,

10:04.821 --> 10:07.258
she was just meat.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.653
<i>But she wasn't just meat, Jason.</i>

10:10.827 --> 10:13.656
<i>She was a person.
Our film professor.</i>

10:13.830 --> 10:14.918
Yeah, well,

10:16.093 --> 10:18.008
fuck her.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.752
She gave me a C-minus
on my giallo paper.

10:22.926 --> 10:26.190
<i>Is that why you killed her?
Because of the C-minus?[sighs]</i>

10:26.364 --> 10:29.193
<i>Who's next, your grade-school
vice principal?</i>

10:29.367 --> 10:30.847
You know who's next.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.283
Why are you
being like this?

10:32.457 --> 10:34.372
<i>Come on, Jason.</i>

10:34.546 --> 10:36.679
<i>How long
have we known each other?</i>

10:40.422 --> 10:41.641
You tell me.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.863
<i>Eight years.</i>

10:47.037 --> 10:49.561
<i>We met in junior high.
In Atlanta.</i>

10:49.736 --> 10:53.565
<i>I just want you to tell me
why you think
you're doing this.</i>

10:53.740 --> 10:54.741
<i>In your words.</i>

10:54.915 --> 10:56.351
We're finishing
Richie's film.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.832
<i>That's right,
by killing Sam and Tara.</i>

10:59.006 --> 11:00.355
Why are you fucking with me?

11:01.225 --> 11:03.053
Why won't you tell me
where you are?

11:03.227 --> 11:06.143
<i>Why do you keep asking me that?
I already told you.</i>

11:06.317 --> 11:08.058
<i>I'm here.</i>

11:10.495 --> 11:13.411
<i>Let's play a game.</i>[sighs] Shit.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.283
<i>Do you know Warmer, Colder?</i>

11:15.457 --> 11:17.502
<i>Come on, find me.</i>

11:17.677 --> 11:19.896
<i>And then we'll go and cut up
the Carpenter sisters.</i>

11:20.070 --> 11:22.116
Are you using
the fucking cameras?

11:22.290 --> 11:23.900
<i>Yeah. The cameras.</i>

11:24.074 --> 11:27.948
<i>And at the moment,
you're very, very cold.</i>

11:28.122 --> 11:29.906
All right, douchebag,
let's play.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.350
<i>Cold.</i>

11:45.008 --> 11:46.662
<i>Heating up.</i>

11:52.276 --> 11:53.408
<i>Warmer.</i>

11:56.411 --> 11:57.542
<i>Warmer.</i>

12:13.950 --> 12:15.822
All right, you know what?
This is stupid.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.171
I'm gonna hang up now.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.868
<i>But you're getting warmer.</i>

12:23.830 --> 12:25.092
<i>Colder.</i>

12:32.447 --> 12:33.535
<i>Warmer.</i>

12:35.450 --> 12:36.581
<i>Warmer.</i>

12:37.539 --> 12:39.628
<i>You're on fire!</i>

12:40.847 --> 12:43.023
Oh, fuck!

12:49.420 --> 12:51.074
Do you feel
like an animal, Jason?

12:54.251 --> 12:55.383
Please, stop!

12:59.039 --> 13:00.257
Like meat?

13:02.912 --> 13:05.480
But we have
to finish the movie.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.438
Who gives a fuck about movies?

13:09.136 --> 13:10.224

13:40.950 --> 13:43.213
So how are the new meds
treating you?

13:44.693 --> 13:45.912
Okay, I think.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.437
Still not seeing anyone
I shouldn't be.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.614
What I'm really worried about,
though, is Tara.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.660
What I'm really
worried about is you.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.272
You've been coming here
for six months now,

13:58.446 --> 13:59.926
and all we've
really spoken about

14:00.100 --> 14:02.493
is how your sister
isn't dealing with

14:02.667 --> 14:04.278
whatever happened
to both of you

14:04.452 --> 14:05.801
a year ago.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.064
Now, you've alluded
to an abusive relationship,

14:08.238 --> 14:10.893
issues with your father,

14:11.067 --> 14:16.464
but every time I push you
for specifics, you shut down.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.163
I have trust issues.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.904
Okay.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.168
If I'm going
to help you,

14:25.342 --> 14:29.346
um, I-- I need you to
give me the details.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.483
Okay.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.753
My father was Billy Loomis.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.103
He was a famous serial killer.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.976
They made a movie about him.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.892
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Certainly did.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.284
Last year I found out

14:54.458 --> 14:56.765
that my boyfriend
was also a serial killer

14:56.939 --> 14:59.072
and only dating me
because he idolized my father.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.291
- Uh-huh.
- Him and his psycho girlfriend

15:01.465 --> 15:02.814
killed a bunch of people.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.773
And when it got out
that I'm Billy's daughter,

15:04.947 --> 15:06.601
this crazy rumor started online

15:06.775 --> 15:08.951
that I orchestrated
the whole thing and framed them.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.482
Huh?

15:18.656 --> 15:20.484
Richie was my boyfriend.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.535
But you didn't.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.799
- Of course not.
- Okay.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.540
He almost killed my sister

15:32.714 --> 15:33.758
and me,

15:34.672 --> 15:35.978
before I stopped him.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.588
Okay, and how...

15:37.762 --> 15:39.851
How-how did you stop him?

15:40.026 --> 15:43.029
Well, I stabbed him 22 times
and slit his throat.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.814
And then I shot him
in the head.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.251
But that's not why I'm here.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.646
Why are you here?

15:53.387 --> 15:54.388
Because...

15:58.218 --> 16:00.394
it felt right.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.403
I... [clears throat] Uh...
I think we're done here.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.755
What? No, you said
give you details. I'm just--

16:13.929 --> 16:16.932
I-- I'm not equipped
to deal with this kind of thing.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.891
Please, Dr. Stone.
I'm asking for your help.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.677
By law, I'm required
to report this
to the authorities.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.809
Report it? Report what?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.724
I didn't say
I was gonna do anything.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.813
Not explicitly, no.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.076
You know what?

16:31.033 --> 16:32.121
Forget it.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.385
You're just like all the others.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.020
<i>Hey, you've reached Tara.
Why aren't you texting me?</i>

17:01.194 --> 17:04.197
You know you're supposed
to pick up when I call.

17:04.371 --> 17:07.722
I got out of therapy early,
so I was thinking
maybe we cook dinner tonight.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.812
If you want.
I'll see you soon.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.564
Hey!

17:29.048 --> 17:30.614
Tara?

17:49.459 --> 17:51.113
Oh, yeah.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.723
Quinn?

17:52.897 --> 17:54.899
Oh, shit.[Quinn's lover] Come on!

17:55.987 --> 17:57.685
Were we being too loud?

17:57.859 --> 18:00.514
Not at all.
Have you seen Tara?

18:00.688 --> 18:01.906
Um...

18:02.081 --> 18:03.343
Don't be mad.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.214
- Why would I be mad?
- Because you get mad.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.390
Is that Paul?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.871
Who the fuck is Paul?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.569
Life, I have found,

18:12.743 --> 18:14.919
is about variety.

18:19.707 --> 18:20.795
Okay.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.190
- Uh, this one's yours.
- Thanks.

18:24.364 --> 18:25.582
Where's Tara?

18:25.756 --> 18:27.845
She went
to the Omega Kappa Beta party.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.717
I begged her
not to go to that!

18:29.891 --> 18:31.327
And we've now arrived
at mad.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.288
Do you know if she at least
took her Taser?

18:35.462 --> 18:38.900
I cannot speak
to how heavily armed Tara is

18:39.074 --> 18:40.858
at this fraternity party.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.342
Babe, you coming back?"Babe"?

18:46.516 --> 18:47.517
I don't know.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.569
Ooh,
is Cute Boy shirtless again?

18:55.743 --> 18:59.790
- Who's Cute Boy, babe?
- Always you... sweetie.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.010
You guys have been checking
each other out for months.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.533
Why don't you just
talk to him?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.144
Because that right there

19:05.318 --> 19:07.015
is about all the romantic
interaction I'm ready for.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.060
- I'm gonna go find Tara.
- Okay.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.758
- Be right back.
- Bye.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.934
[whispers] Damn.

It doesn't bother you?

19:50.450 --> 19:53.888
Being at a house party
after you were almost

19:54.062 --> 19:56.151
brutally murdered
at a house party?

19:56.325 --> 19:58.762
No, I think of it
like being struck by lightning.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.590
The odds of it
happening twice

20:00.764 --> 20:02.288
to the same person
are extremely low.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.593
Ah.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.248
Guess I should stay close
to you then.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.079
Shit, I'm sorry.
Watch out.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.168
Hi.

20:14.561 --> 20:15.910
How are you doing, T?

20:16.084 --> 20:17.128
Hi.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.479
You're lying.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.176
No, last one's kicked.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.570
We got some hard stuff
in the kitchen, though.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.573
Frankie.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.444
Tara.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.751
Lead the way.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.101
You Omega Beta Zeta?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.538
No, not yet.
But I might rush it.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.280
Oh, freshman. Right on!

20:39.847 --> 20:41.327
Where from?

20:43.416 --> 20:44.634
Michigan.

20:44.808 --> 20:45.983
All right.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.768
You know what?

20:47.942 --> 20:50.249
I got a bottle of Fireball
up in my room.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.429
Fuck it. Yeah, go.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.868
- Uh... Oh, I don't love that.
- Mm-mmm.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.045
Hey!
You want to call it a night?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.395
No, uh...

21:06.569 --> 21:08.441
I think that I'm actually
still gonna hang,

21:08.615 --> 21:10.138
but you guys don't have
to wait for me.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.140
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.576
I'm Frankie.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.752
And I'm spectacularly uninterested

21:15.926 --> 21:17.493
in knowing
anything about you.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.368
No, dude, Anika,
I'm not that bad.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.545
But I appreciate you
looking out for me.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.247
Let me see it in your face.
Mmm. Mmm.

21:32.421 --> 21:35.250
- Closer. Closer. Ooh. Uh.
- Ooh.

21:35.424 --> 21:36.469
All right, all right.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.209
Cheers, man,
to the dynamic duo

21:38.384 --> 21:41.778
of Hortense Tower,
third floor, room 315.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.258
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

21:46.174 --> 21:48.611
Oh, man.
Time to start making moves.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.874
Yeah, get you out there.
Introduce you to some girls!

21:51.048 --> 21:52.136
What about her?

21:53.660 --> 21:54.748
She's gorgeous.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.402
- Great. Ask her out.
- No, I can't.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.099
Ask her out. Ask her out.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.622
Shut up!

21:59.796 --> 22:01.145
Got to have confidence.
Plus, look at you, man!

22:01.320 --> 22:02.625
You're a snack!

22:02.799 --> 22:04.801
Practically an entire meal
all on your own.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.934
- Really?
- Yeah. You're Ethan Landry.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.370
Hey, excuse me!

22:08.544 --> 22:10.503
- Chad.
- Howdy. How you doing?

22:10.677 --> 22:13.070
My friend here,
he's a snack, right?

22:17.161 --> 22:18.946
- What did that mean?
- No, it's good.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.121
- What?
- It's not bad.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.427
There's room for improvement!

22:21.601 --> 22:23.342
Hey, big guy, you're needed.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.606
See ya.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.999
Aren't you that girl involved
in that "Stab" shit

22:29.173 --> 22:30.610
in California last year?

22:30.784 --> 22:33.090
No.
That's a different pirate.

22:33.264 --> 22:34.831
Hey, partner!

22:36.137 --> 22:37.443
Tara's good down here.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.749
Sorry, bro,
I didn't catch that.

22:41.534 --> 22:42.970
Yeah, you did.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.319
No, Chad.

22:45.581 --> 22:48.149
- It's fine. I want to.
- Yeah, see, Chad?

22:48.889 --> 22:50.499
- It's okay.
- She wants to.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.240
Come on.[winces] Ow!

22:52.414 --> 22:56.287
- Get your fucking hands off her.
- Get the fuck off me!

22:56.462 --> 22:57.680
Guys!

22:57.854 --> 22:59.769
Who the fuck are you,
<i>Risky Business?</i>

22:59.943 --> 23:01.292
Stop![Sam] Guys, guys!

23:01.467 --> 23:02.816
Sorry to interrupt.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.731
I'm just gonna tase you
in the balls real quick.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.170
Don't ever lay hands
on my sister.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.390
You fucking bitch!

23:11.564 --> 23:13.304
Sam.[Frankie] Fuck you!

23:13.479 --> 23:14.871
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:15.045 --> 23:16.525
You're stalking me now?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.137
Holy shit,
it's that psycho girl!

23:20.834 --> 23:22.401
That's her?

23:25.012 --> 23:27.101
Tara. Will you stop?

23:27.275 --> 23:29.059
I cannot believe you did that!
You embarrassed me.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.321
That guy was a dick.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.366
He was gonna
take advantage of you.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.672
- So?
- So?

23:32.846 --> 23:34.021
If I want to hook up
with an asshole,

23:34.195 --> 23:35.588
that's my decision!

23:35.762 --> 23:37.764
- It's my decision.
- Okay.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.156
It's not about you!

23:39.330 --> 23:40.810
You're out of my life
for five years,

23:40.984 --> 23:42.986
and then you can't
leave me alone for five minutes.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.772
Because you're not dealing
with what happened to us.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.643
Have you even gone
to see the counselor once?

23:47.817 --> 23:49.515
No, I'm not going to.[Sam] Why not?

23:49.689 --> 23:52.605
Because I'm uninterested in
living in the past like you are.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.476
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Guys, come on.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.305
It means I'm not gonna let what
happened to us for three days

23:57.479 --> 23:59.481
define the rest of my life.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.223
So you're just gonna
pretend it never happened.

24:02.397 --> 24:05.444
What are you doing here, Sam?
In New York.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.142
You're working two shitty jobs
to help with rent, whatever,

24:08.316 --> 24:09.883
but what's your plan?

24:11.362 --> 24:13.060
I know what I'm gonna do.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.323
Okay? Because I'm gonna
keep going to college,

24:15.497 --> 24:18.239
I'm gonna get my degree,
and I'm gonna live my life.

24:18.761 --> 24:19.980
My life.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.112
Okay? I know.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.811
You just followed me here,

24:24.985 --> 24:26.726
and you won't let me
out of your sight.

24:29.424 --> 24:30.643
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.819
I--

24:32.993 --> 24:33.950
I know.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.430
I know you are.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.390
You can't do it
for the rest of my life, though.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.481
You have to let me go.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.135
Hey!

24:46.528 --> 24:47.660
Murderer!

24:47.834 --> 24:49.879
What the fuck is wrong
with you, bitch?

24:50.053 --> 24:51.141
You got a problem with me?

24:51.315 --> 24:52.795
You guys should stay away
from her.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.058
- She knows what she did.
- I didn't fucking do anything!

24:55.232 --> 24:56.625
Sure, bitch.

24:56.799 --> 24:57.626
Walk away!

24:57.800 --> 24:59.323
I'm so sick of this shit.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.456
Hey, calm down. Come on.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.980
Hey, I have tissues
if you want tissues.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.375
I have, like,
three tissues.

25:07.549 --> 25:13.033

[Quinn] Hey.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.750
I'm sorry I told Sam
where you went.

25:34.924 --> 25:36.970
It's fine. I just...

25:38.624 --> 25:40.147
She's all the way up my ass.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.236
Like usual.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.935
I know what it's like
when they hold on too tight.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.547
After we, um...

25:50.549 --> 25:51.811
lost my brother,

25:53.160 --> 25:56.467
my dad
wouldn't leave me alone.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.123
He even transferred to the NYPD
when I got into college, so...

26:00.297 --> 26:02.517
Stalker much?

26:05.085 --> 26:08.741
I'm gonna go,
let you guys... chat.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.224
[Tara] Thank you.

go back to your dorm.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.925
I'm pretty sure
the fighting is done
for the day.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.014
That's too bad.

26:21.188 --> 26:24.234
I was actually looking forward
to getting some shots in
while I can.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.584
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.150
Bring it.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.239
Um...

26:32.460 --> 26:33.635
Thank you

it's Diet Cherry Coke, actually.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.290

29:30.464 --> 29:32.727
No, I love it! I do.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.344

conspiracy nut?

Being famous
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.830

- Again.
- Mm-hmm.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.398
She says she wants me
to let her go.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.575
Yeah, family can be rough.

No, wait, let's talk
about this for a second.

30:40.229 --> 30:41.840
'Cause this might not
have anything to do with us.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.929

- It's a big city!

It's Halloween.
Everybody's wearing masks!

30:45.844 --> 30:48.324
- You don't know.
- Tara,
this isn't a coincidence.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.110
- You knew him!
- Barely.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.502
Chad, Mindy, back me up.

It is a little bit... Close to home.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.594
See?

30:58.987 --> 31:00.859
Quinn, your dad's a cop, right?

31:01.033 --> 31:02.948
Can you call him
and find out what's going on?

31:03.122 --> 31:04.688
Before you make
the unilateral decision

31:04.863 --> 31:07.691
to abandon my college education
and flee the fucking state!

31:07.866 --> 31:10.303
- I'm calling him now.
- Thank you.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.227
Who is it?

31:25.448 --> 31:28.321
Why did everyone just freak out
when her phone rang?

31:28.495 --> 31:29.626
You got to keep up, my dude.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.106
Sam?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.326
My dad wants to talk to you.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.459
Mr. Bailey, hi.[Mr. Bailey] <i>Hey, Sam.</i>

31:36.633 --> 31:39.201
I was actually just about
to call you.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.987
<i>Well, my sister thinks
I'm probably overreacting.</i>

31:42.161 --> 31:44.380
No, unfortunately, you're not.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.513
<i>What do you mean?
What's going on?</i>

31:47.775 --> 31:50.343
I'm afraid I need you
to come down to the station.

31:56.479 --> 31:57.698
Sam, slow down.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.700
Tara, no.
Get back inside, lock the door.

31:59.874 --> 32:00.962
Are you serious?

32:01.136 --> 32:02.355
Now you don't want
to stick together?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.010
Fine.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.849
What the fuck?

32:19.894 --> 32:22.244
I never deleted his contact.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.768
This is coming
- from his number.
- Don't pick that up.

32:25.595 --> 32:26.901
Just let it ring.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.556
Sam.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.951
Who is this?
<i>Hello, Samantha.</i>

32:33.125 --> 32:34.474
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

32:34.648 --> 32:35.910
I want you to think
long and hard

32:36.084 --> 32:37.477
about whether you really
want to do this.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.435
Because the last two people
that fucked with us

32:39.609 --> 32:40.915
ended up dead.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.526
<i>You should be thanking me, Sam.</i>

32:43.700 --> 32:47.182
<i>Jason and Greg were gonna
kill you and your sister.</i>

32:47.356 --> 32:51.143
<i>I gutted them
before they had the chance.</i>

32:57.018 --> 32:59.760
So what?
You're protecting us now?

32:59.934 --> 33:01.457
<i>Not quite.</i>

33:01.631 --> 33:03.764
<i>I'm going to show the world
who you really are:</i>

33:03.938 --> 33:05.722
<i>A liar and a killer.</i>

33:05.896 --> 33:08.377
<i>I'm going to punish you, Sam.</i>

33:08.551 --> 33:11.119
You shouldn't believe
everything you read
on the Internet, asshole.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.687
<i>Don't be cute.
You're gonna pay
for what you did.</i>

33:13.861 --> 33:16.298
<i>And I'm not gonna stop
until I butcher you.</i>

33:16.472 --> 33:18.387
<i>You and anyone
who gets between us.</i>

33:18.561 --> 33:20.607
<i>You and Tara
better watch your backs.</i>

33:20.781 --> 33:22.609
You better watch yours.

33:23.523 --> 33:26.047
No! No!

33:26.221 --> 33:28.223
Run!

33:29.355 --> 33:30.530
Come on!

33:30.704 --> 33:33.359
- Help! Please!
- In there!

33:36.666 --> 33:37.711
Please help us!

33:37.885 --> 33:39.365
- We were just attacked.
- Call 911!

33:39.539 --> 33:41.802
There's a fucking line here,
girls.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.847
I'm telling you, sir.
Could you--

33:45.197 --> 33:46.720
You got a problem here, guy?

33:58.601 --> 33:59.994
Hey!

34:10.352 --> 34:12.398
- Go out the back!
- Thank you!

34:14.835 --> 34:17.577
Fuck, it's locked.
- Keys! We need your keys!

34:20.101 --> 34:21.581
- Look out!
- Watch out!

34:26.542 --> 34:27.761
Wait.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.763
Wait, wait! No, no, no!

36:07.774 --> 36:09.732
Run! Go! Run!

36:14.737 --> 36:17.740
Let's go.[officer 2] Going round back.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.204
This was found next to the body
at the apartment crime scene.

36:47.553 --> 36:51.078
DNA says that it belonged
to someone named Richie Kirsch.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.429
Does that ring a bell?

36:56.649 --> 36:58.172
We're familiar
with him.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.522
But the one that attacked us
had a different mask on.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.656
It was kind of more beat up.
Like it was older.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.006
Uh...

37:06.180 --> 37:07.399
I got to ask...

37:08.748 --> 37:10.184
do you have alibis
for earlier tonight?

37:10.358 --> 37:12.621
I was at a party
with my friends.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.710
I was at my therapist's.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.670
I can give you his information.
You can call to check
if you want.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.585
And then I met Tara
at that party,

37:19.759 --> 37:21.326
where I tased someone.

37:22.414 --> 37:23.415
Unrelated.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.418
Was that before
or after this happened?

37:26.592 --> 37:27.984
<i>Murderer!</i>

37:28.158 --> 37:29.638
<i>What the fuck
is wrong with you, bitch?</i>

37:29.812 --> 37:32.032
<i>You got a problem with me?</i> Before.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.295
The point is,
we were with people all night.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.080
So, our roommate's dad

37:37.255 --> 37:39.387
just happened
to pull our case.

37:39.561 --> 37:41.389
That'd be a crazy coincidence, right?

37:41.563 --> 37:43.696
- Yeah.
- The detective who had the case,

37:43.870 --> 37:46.481
he offered it to me
because it involves Quinn.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.658
Um, but I can totally give it
back if you're uncomfortable.

37:49.832 --> 37:50.964
It's up to you.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.578
It's fine.

37:56.752 --> 37:59.364
So if the man who attacked you
did steal your license

37:59.538 --> 38:00.974
and plant it next to the body,

38:02.192 --> 38:04.369
it'd probably be somebody
close to you.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.415
How long have you known
your friends?

38:07.589 --> 38:08.982
Well, we moved here
with Mindy and Chad

38:09.156 --> 38:10.723
for summer semester,
like, six months ago.

38:10.897 --> 38:16.424
So, Quinn, um, Ethan, Anika--
all since then.

38:16.598 --> 38:20.385
I think I can vouch for Quinn,
so that's one less
we have to worry about.

38:20.559 --> 38:23.736
Do either of you have anyone
that might want to target you?

38:25.651 --> 38:27.305
Not anyone
who's still alive.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.742
Yikes.

38:29.916 --> 38:32.919
FBI's here,
claiming jurisdiction.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.137
Where are they?

38:40.274 --> 38:41.667
Can I help you?

38:44.713 --> 38:46.802
Special Agent Kirby Reed, FBI.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.587
I work out
of the Atlanta office.

38:48.761 --> 38:49.979
Oh. You lost?

38:51.894 --> 38:53.287
Your two vics
were residents of my city

38:53.461 --> 38:54.854
before they moved here
for college.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.986
I have been investigating
their online activity

38:57.160 --> 38:58.684
for the past few months.

39:00.773 --> 39:01.730
Wow.

39:01.904 --> 39:03.297
Why?

39:03.471 --> 39:06.039
I take a special interest
in Ghostface attacks.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.954
- Kirby?
- Hey, Sam.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.348
What?

39:11.044 --> 39:12.045
Tara.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.700
You're the FBI?Mm-hmm.

39:14.874 --> 39:16.963
- You guys know each other?
- Yeah.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.660
We went
to Woodsboro High together.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.749
She was a senior
when I was a freshman.

39:20.923 --> 39:23.012
We share a certain history, yeah.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.275
I'm not trying
to get into

39:25.450 --> 39:26.973
a jurisdictional
pissing contest here,

39:27.147 --> 39:28.540
I just want to help.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.934
I'll show you mine,
et cetera.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.285
Thank you.

39:36.548 --> 39:37.984
He left this mask
at the bodega.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.203
DNA traces of two individuals,

39:40.378 --> 39:42.989
Charlie Walker, Jill Roberts,
both deceased.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.601
The Ghostface killers of 2011.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.039
Charlie Walker gave me this.

39:50.213 --> 39:52.302
Like I said,
I take a special interest.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.001
Is this the mask he was wearing
when he attacked you?

39:55.958 --> 39:57.003
No.

39:57.177 --> 39:59.048
So he's leaving them
on purpose.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.659
Which means whoever's doing this

40:00.833 --> 40:02.878
is a student of the killers
who came before.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.097
Maybe he believes

40:04.271 --> 40:06.229
Sam is the latest
in a long line.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.755
Yeah, good luck with that.
We're getting out of town.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.322
I'm sorry,
that's not possible.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.151
You're both persons of interest
in a double homicide,

40:15.325 --> 40:17.197
so you're not allowed
to leave town. Sorry.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.591
- Are you serious?
- He's right.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.202
But if we work together--We're going.

40:27.468 --> 40:30.340
Samantha, do you have an alibi
for last night's murders?

40:30.515 --> 40:32.342
Tara, do you feel safe
around your sister?

40:32.517 --> 40:34.562
Tara! Tara!

40:34.736 --> 40:36.477
Gale Weathers, Channel 4.

40:37.522 --> 40:38.958
Do you ladies
think you're the reason

40:39.132 --> 40:41.003
the Ghostface killer
has come to the Big Apple?

40:44.877 --> 40:48.097
Nice try, sweetie,
but I've done this dance before.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.929
Stay away from us.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.627
Are you still mad at me?

40:55.801 --> 40:58.238
You said you wouldn't write
a book about what happened.

40:58.412 --> 40:59.979
And then you wrote a book
about what happened.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.241
Oh, come on.

41:01.415 --> 41:02.721
Somebody was gonna write
about it!

41:02.895 --> 41:04.244
It's what I do.

41:04.418 --> 41:05.898
I heard you couldn't sell
the movie rights.

41:06.072 --> 41:09.554
It's all about true-crime
limited series these days.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.599
After everything
we went through together.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.036
What would Dewey think?

41:15.864 --> 41:17.823
- That's a low blow.
- So was your book.

41:17.997 --> 41:20.956
You called me "unstable"
and a "born killer."

41:21.130 --> 41:24.307
- That's taken out of context.
- That's literally a quote.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.048
You don't think
what you wrote
has something to do

41:26.222 --> 41:28.007
with what's happening to us?

41:28.181 --> 41:30.096
Come on.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.054
Hey, I talked to Sidney.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.059
She's not coming here,
- is she?
- No.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.626
She sends her love,

41:38.800 --> 41:41.237
but she's taking Mark
and the kids someplace safe.

41:41.411 --> 41:43.588
She deserves
to have her happy ending.

41:45.546 --> 41:46.982
On that much, we agree.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.899
Hey, I want to catch this fucker
as much as you do!

41:51.073 --> 41:52.292
Maybe.

41:52.466 --> 41:53.728
Or maybe you're just afraid

41:53.902 --> 41:55.164
that without Ghostface
in your life,

41:55.338 --> 41:56.905
you're gonna fade away.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.175
<i>You fools! You're in danger!</i>

42:06.349 --> 42:09.135
<i>Can't you see?
They're after you!</i>

42:09.309 --> 42:11.354
<i>They're after all of us!
Our wives,</i>

42:11.529 --> 42:13.008
<i>our children, everyone!</i>

42:13.182 --> 42:16.490
<i>They're here already!
You're next!</i>

42:16.664 --> 42:21.626
<i>You're next! You're next!
You're next!</i>

42:21.800 --> 42:23.192
<i>You're next!</i>

42:31.679 --> 42:33.202
Who is it?

42:49.479 --> 42:53.222
You're a day early
for trick-or-treating, you know.

43:27.953 --> 43:31.304
<i>♪ Take a little walk
To the edge of town♪</i>

43:31.478 --> 43:33.349
<i>♪ And go across the tracks... ♪</i>

43:33.523 --> 43:36.004
Okay, nerds,
listen up!

43:36.178 --> 43:38.093
As terrifying
as this all is,

43:38.267 --> 43:40.530
I'm actually glad
I get a chance to redeem myself

43:40.705 --> 43:43.098
for not calling the killers
last time.

43:43.272 --> 43:45.884
- Yep.
- It's fine. Okay.

43:46.058 --> 43:49.496
The way I see it, someone is out
to make a sequel to the requel.

43:49.670 --> 43:51.324
Um, what's a requel?

43:51.498 --> 43:54.457
You're beautiful, sweetie.
Let's hold questions to the end.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.677
<i>Stab 1</i> took place
in Woodsboro.

43:56.851 --> 43:59.332
<i>Stab 2</i> took place in college.

43:59.506 --> 44:01.682
So we think that
the killer is trying
to copy the movies?

44:01.856 --> 44:03.292
That is one possibility.

44:03.466 --> 44:05.512
Heroes now in college:
Check.

44:05.686 --> 44:08.341
Suspicious new characters
brought in
to round out the suspect list

44:08.515 --> 44:11.605
and/or body count:
Check, check and check.
I don't like this.

44:11.779 --> 44:13.389
But it can't just be
about <i>Stab 2.</i>

44:13.563 --> 44:15.261
- Why not?
- It would make sense

44:15.435 --> 44:16.828
if this were just a sequel.

44:17.002 --> 44:18.307
But we're not in a sequel,

44:18.481 --> 44:20.658
because nobody
just makes sequels anymore.

44:23.138 --> 44:24.749
We're in a franchise!

44:24.923 --> 44:28.317
And there are certain rules
to a continuing franchise.

44:28.491 --> 44:30.450
- I had a feeling.
- Rule one:

44:30.624 --> 44:32.147
Everything is bigger
than last time.

44:32.321 --> 44:35.150
Bigger budget, bigger cast,
bigger body count.

44:35.324 --> 44:37.065
Longer chases, shoot-outs, beheadings.

44:37.239 --> 44:39.111
You got to top what came before
to keep people coming back.

44:39.285 --> 44:41.200
- Beheadings?
- Beheadings.

44:41.374 --> 44:44.725
Rule two:
Whatever happened last time,
expect the opposite.

44:44.899 --> 44:47.772
Franchises only survive
by subverting expectations.

44:47.946 --> 44:50.949
If the killers last time
were whiny snowflake film nerds

44:51.123 --> 44:52.994
with Letterboxd accounts
instead of personalities,

44:53.168 --> 44:55.780
you can bet
the opposite will be true here.

44:55.954 --> 44:59.261
And rule three:
No one is safe.

44:59.435 --> 45:02.177
Legacy characters?
Cannon fodder at this point.

45:02.351 --> 45:04.179
Usually brought back
only to be killed off

45:04.353 --> 45:06.399
in some cheap bid
for nostalgia.

45:06.573 --> 45:09.097
It's not looking too good
for Gale and Kirby.

45:09.271 --> 45:11.360
Oh, and that's
not even the worst part!

45:11.534 --> 45:13.493
This is the part where she
tells us the worst part.

45:13.667 --> 45:15.713
The worst part is

45:15.887 --> 45:20.282
franchises are just
continuing episodic installments
designed to boost an IP.

45:20.456 --> 45:22.589
Which means main characters

45:22.763 --> 45:24.852
are completely expendable now, too.

45:25.026 --> 45:28.290
Laurie Strode, Nancy Thompson,
Ellen Ripley,

45:28.464 --> 45:31.206
Sally Hardesty, Jigsaw,
Tony Stark, James Bond--

45:31.380 --> 45:33.034
I mean, even Luke Skywalker--

45:33.208 --> 45:35.776
all died so their franchises
could live on.

45:35.950 --> 45:38.170
That means it's not
just the friend group.

45:38.344 --> 45:41.086
Any of us could go
at any time,

45:41.956 --> 45:43.697
especially Sam and Tara.

45:45.699 --> 45:47.962
Wait, any of us?[Mindy] Yeah.

45:48.136 --> 45:50.748
Am I in the friend group?[Mindy] Yeah.

45:50.922 --> 45:53.359
Am I, like,
one of the targets?[Mindy] Mm-hmm.

45:54.577 --> 45:56.057
Am I gonna die a virgin?

45:57.885 --> 45:59.365
That was a weird overshare.

45:59.539 --> 46:01.715
But it brings us
to our current suspects:

46:02.281 --> 46:03.456
Ethan.

46:03.630 --> 46:05.066
The shy, dorky guy
who no one suspects

46:05.240 --> 46:06.938
because he's so shy and dorky.

46:07.112 --> 46:08.678
Why am I
on the suspect list?

46:08.853 --> 46:11.029
Because I'm randomly
Chad's roommate?

46:11.203 --> 46:12.944
Roommate lotteries
can be juked.

46:13.118 --> 46:15.163
You could have fixed it
to get next to us.

46:15.337 --> 46:16.425
Quinn.

46:16.599 --> 46:17.905
The slutty roommate.

46:18.079 --> 46:19.733
A horror movie...
...classic.

46:19.907 --> 46:22.562
"Sex positive,"
but... thank you?

46:22.736 --> 46:25.695
Mm-hmm. Um, how did you come
to live with Sam and Tara?

46:25.870 --> 46:28.002
I answered their ad online.

46:28.176 --> 46:29.395
Okay, say no more.

46:29.569 --> 46:31.484
You've already implicated
yourself enough.

46:31.658 --> 46:33.225
It was an anonymous ad, Mindy.

46:33.399 --> 46:35.488
And you know we vetted her.
Plus her dad is a cop.

46:35.662 --> 46:37.577
And that makes it more likely
that she's the killer,

46:37.751 --> 46:39.231
because having a cop dad
is a great cover.

46:39.405 --> 46:41.711
Do you not remember
how these movies work, Tara?

46:42.495 --> 46:44.149
Is she always like this?

46:44.323 --> 46:46.368
And finally... Anika.

46:48.675 --> 46:50.590
Never trust the love interest.

46:53.419 --> 46:57.553
Okay! So, we have our rules
and we have our suspects.

46:57.727 --> 46:59.338
But wait.
What about you guys?

46:59.512 --> 47:02.732
I mean, I think it's pretty safe
to rule out the four of us

47:02.907 --> 47:04.996
who went through this last year
in Woodsboro.

47:05.170 --> 47:07.215
- Agreed.
- Um, not agreed.

47:07.389 --> 47:09.609
What if the trauma
you all went through

47:09.783 --> 47:12.525
caused one
or more of you to snap?

47:12.699 --> 47:16.398
Yeah, or the fame you got
from the killings
made you thirsty for more.

47:16.572 --> 47:18.009
I mean, let's be honest here,

47:18.183 --> 47:20.446
some of the theories online
about Sam are--

47:20.620 --> 47:22.056
Don't you fucking dare.

47:22.230 --> 47:24.885
Okay, she's right, though.

47:25.059 --> 47:26.278
I mean, face facts--

47:26.452 --> 47:28.323
if we're all suspects,
you're all suspects.

47:37.332 --> 47:41.684
Remember Samantha Carpenter's
- alibi, the therapist?
- Mm-hmm.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.905
He was stabbed
- to death. Through the nose.
- Mmm.

47:45.079 --> 47:47.299
Through the nose.
How messed up is that?

47:47.473 --> 47:49.518
It's pretty messed up.

47:49.692 --> 47:52.347
He turned her in
for making threatening remarks,

47:52.521 --> 47:53.827
ended up dead.

47:54.001 --> 47:56.090
And guess which patient's
notes were stolen?

47:57.657 --> 48:00.878
So Sam kills her own alibi and
steals her own session notes?

48:01.052 --> 48:02.096
Maybe.

48:03.315 --> 48:04.707
Another mask
was found at the scene.

48:05.665 --> 48:07.362
It's a DNA match
for Roman Bridger.

48:07.536 --> 48:10.322
The Ghostface
who was directing <i>Stab 3.</i>

48:11.758 --> 48:14.892
It's like he's leaving us
real-life franchise Easter eggs.

48:15.066 --> 48:18.634
Like dropping
the killers' masks in reverse.

48:18.808 --> 48:21.333
Almost like he's counting down
to something.

48:22.551 --> 48:24.031
What happens
when he gets to one?

48:29.080 --> 48:32.039
So we've had nine
Ghostface killers so far.

48:32.213 --> 48:33.606
Nine. I thought in the movies--

48:33.780 --> 48:36.043
Forget about the movies.
The movies don't matter.

48:36.217 --> 48:39.655
Look. Last year was
Amber Freeman and Richie Kirsch,

48:39.829 --> 48:41.614
whose masks we found
at the first crime scene

48:41.788 --> 48:44.008
along with the bodies
of two film students

48:44.182 --> 48:46.836
who killed their professor
earlier that same night.

48:47.011 --> 48:49.883
Then it was Jill Roberts
and Charlie Walker--

48:50.057 --> 48:51.319
theirs at the bodega.

48:51.493 --> 48:53.843
Roman Bridger was the only
single Ghostface.

48:54.018 --> 48:55.236
Kudos to him for ambition.

48:55.410 --> 48:57.717
His mask
was found at the shrink's.

48:57.891 --> 49:01.373
Which leaves Mickey Altieri,
Nancy Loomis, Stu Macher...

49:01.547 --> 49:03.853
...and Billy Loomis. Number one.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.943
And the father
of our chief suspect.

49:07.509 --> 49:10.686
Well, whoever's doing this
is leading us back to Sam.

49:14.603 --> 49:15.996
I will check in later.

49:16.170 --> 49:18.172
And tell your daughter
to stay sharp.

49:18.346 --> 49:21.393
Proximity to the Carpenters
is proximity to Ghostface.

49:31.229 --> 49:34.014
Hey, Jack? Would you call
the Atlanta field office?

49:35.015 --> 49:36.974
Dig up what you can
on Agent Reed.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.460
I think you should
get out of the city.

49:45.634 --> 49:48.289
You know, considering
what happened to you
last time.

49:48.463 --> 49:53.077
I-- I wouldn't blame you
if... you wanted to go.

49:55.601 --> 49:58.169
That's very thoughtful of you,
but, um,

49:59.561 --> 50:01.085
I don't think
I'm going anywhere.

50:02.477 --> 50:04.479
Will you two
just make out already?

50:04.653 --> 50:07.004
That is so inappropriate,
- dude.
- Oh, whatever.

50:07.178 --> 50:08.701
Get it over with!

50:08.875 --> 50:09.789
Here you go.

50:09.963 --> 50:11.530
Sam?[Sam] Yep?

50:11.704 --> 50:13.662
We do not
have to stay here.

50:13.836 --> 50:16.622
Well, too bad. I insist.
Safety in numbers.

50:16.796 --> 50:18.145
This'll be so fun.

50:18.319 --> 50:19.973
A little slumber party
with the Core Four!

50:20.147 --> 50:21.496
- "Core Four"?
- Yeah.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.324
- Did you give us a nickname?
- I sure did.

50:23.498 --> 50:24.760
We've been through
a lot together,

50:24.934 --> 50:26.501
and it's a pretty cool nickname.

50:26.675 --> 50:28.329
- That's debatable.
- It's extremely debatable.

50:28.503 --> 50:30.244
You can't just give yourself
a nickname, dingus.

50:30.418 --> 50:32.638
Of course I can, dingus,
because I just did.

50:32.812 --> 50:34.770
- Core Four, up top!
- No.

50:34.944 --> 50:36.207
- Down low.
- Get that away from me.

50:36.381 --> 50:38.513
Please,
- for the love of God.
- Don't do it.

50:38.687 --> 50:41.212
I would like a little more
respect and support

50:41.386 --> 50:43.605
from my fellow members
of the Core Four.

50:44.389 --> 50:46.304
Guys. What the hell?

50:46.478 --> 50:49.611
<i>We're hearing from sources
inside the homicide division</i>

50:49.785 --> 50:53.659
<i>that the prime suspect is none
other than Samantha Carpenter,</i>

50:53.833 --> 50:57.228
<i>one of the survivors of
the Woodsboro killings in 2022,</i>

50:57.402 --> 51:00.753
<i>seen here attacking a woman
on the street last night.</i>

51:00.927 --> 51:02.755
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

51:02.929 --> 51:05.105
<i>You got a problem with me?
Knock it off!</i>

51:05.279 --> 51:07.281
<i>Stay away from her.
She knows what she did.</i>

51:07.455 --> 51:09.544
<i>In the wake
of the Woodsboro tragedy
last year,</i>

51:09.718 --> 51:11.372
<i>rumors sprouted online</i>

51:11.546 --> 51:14.984
<i>that Carpenter was actually
responsible for the killings,</i>

51:15.159 --> 51:17.813
<i>blaming the crimes
on her boyfriend, Richie Kirsch</i>

51:17.987 --> 51:19.815
<i>and teen Amber Free--</i>

51:42.273 --> 51:45.276
I know you're not a fan
of the way
that I've been handling things,

51:45.450 --> 51:47.582
and that I've been giving you
a really hard time.

51:47.756 --> 51:48.931
But I can say

51:50.324 --> 51:52.935
that none of us can relate
to what you are experiencing.

51:56.591 --> 51:59.333
And I'm really, really sorry
that you have to do that alone.

52:03.903 --> 52:05.078
It's not your fault.

52:06.819 --> 52:09.691
And I know I shouldn't care
what people think.

52:11.867 --> 52:14.696
It just sucks
being this hated.

52:17.264 --> 52:20.224
Hey. Hey. Just a reminder,

52:20.398 --> 52:23.488
not a single person
in this room hates you.

52:23.662 --> 52:27.535
Okay?
We have all been through
some fucked-up stuff,

52:27.709 --> 52:30.277
and we are
coping with it differently.

52:30.451 --> 52:32.323
But, I mean,
we moved here together

52:32.497 --> 52:34.368
for one
very specific reason.

52:37.241 --> 52:38.285
We are a team.

52:42.420 --> 52:43.464
We are

52:43.638 --> 52:45.249
the Core Fucking Four.

52:45.423 --> 52:47.251
- Thank you very much.
- Ah, I hate myself.

52:47.425 --> 52:49.557
You said it.
That is what I'm talking about.

52:49.731 --> 52:51.211
It's the Core Four.

52:51.385 --> 52:53.300
Say it.[Tara] I'm not gonna say it.

52:53.474 --> 52:54.954
I mean, yes,
we're a team, but...

52:55.128 --> 52:56.738
It's got a nice ring to it.

52:56.912 --> 52:59.872
I've been sleeping with Cute Boy
from across the hall.

53:03.441 --> 53:05.138
- Boom!
- I fucking knew it!

53:05.312 --> 53:07.967
- I knew it, I knew it.
- You called it.

53:08.141 --> 53:10.056
I knew it from the day
you had that hickey.

53:11.927 --> 53:14.191
<i>Sales
of the Ghostface Halloween mask</i>

53:14.365 --> 53:19.021
<i>across the Tri-State area
in the last 24 hours
have gone through the roof!</i>

53:19.196 --> 53:20.588
<i>I've got my mask.</i>

53:20.762 --> 53:22.024
<i>What about you, Jay?</i>[Jay] <i>You know it.</i>

53:22.199 --> 53:24.592
<i>It's gonna be
one spooky Halloween.</i>

53:24.766 --> 53:26.594
<i>I'll say. Now, let's get over to Guy
for a look at our weather.</i>

53:28.161 --> 53:31.599
I know she's my roommate,
but you're, like, the police.

53:33.035 --> 53:34.385
Yo.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.257
[Quinn] No, I know.

53:37.431 --> 53:38.650
Hey!

53:39.564 --> 53:40.869
Fuck.

53:41.043 --> 53:42.828
Hey, yeah.
Wassup, bitch?

53:43.002 --> 53:45.091
I see you, motherfucker.

53:46.701 --> 53:48.442
Sam! Samantha!

53:48.616 --> 53:50.705
I feel like we should high five
or something.

53:50.879 --> 53:52.577
The Core Four High Five--
may we, please?

53:52.751 --> 53:54.840
Don't call it that,
but we'll do the high five.

53:55.014 --> 53:56.450
Come on.

53:56.624 --> 53:59.279
Sam! Samantha!

53:59.453 --> 54:01.150
Sam, what the fuck?

54:01.325 --> 54:03.762
She's really
freaked out and paranoid.

54:03.936 --> 54:06.155
Babe, you gonna join me?[Quinn] Hang on.

54:06.330 --> 54:08.332
No. And don't use
my good face wash.

54:08.506 --> 54:10.464
It's pH-balanced for women.

54:11.509 --> 54:12.858
Pick up your phone, baby.

54:16.905 --> 54:18.559
Is that him?

54:18.733 --> 54:21.910
- No, Tara. Not right now.
- Hey, what are your intentions?

54:22.084 --> 54:23.869
[Chad] That's right.

54:24.043 --> 54:26.350
It's fine. I'll call him back.

54:26.524 --> 54:28.003
Poor guy.[Chad] Okay.

54:30.832 --> 54:33.270
Quinn and her gentleman caller
are back at it again.

54:33.444 --> 54:35.315
She's getting it,
too? Okay.

54:52.245 --> 54:53.855
Help! Stop!

54:55.553 --> 54:56.815
Tara, wait, wait!

55:06.433 --> 55:07.434
Run.

55:08.566 --> 55:10.394
Oh, shit!

55:13.005 --> 55:14.267
Guys, come on!

55:15.268 --> 55:17.096
Oh, fuck.

55:18.010 --> 55:19.533
[Anika] Mindy!

55:19.707 --> 55:21.274
Stay the fuck back!

55:45.167 --> 55:46.212
Hey!

55:50.782 --> 55:52.131
Wait, wait, Chad!

55:52.305 --> 55:53.785
- They're still up there.
- Shit!

56:01.445 --> 56:02.446
Fuck.

56:04.709 --> 56:06.928
- Sam!
- Do you have the keys?

56:07.102 --> 56:08.539
No, I left them inside!

56:17.243 --> 56:19.419
Mindy, bathroom door. Hurry!

56:21.987 --> 56:23.771
Oh, fuck! That guy's dead.

56:44.705 --> 56:46.054
Oh, shit.

56:47.012 --> 56:48.361
Oh, fuck.

56:50.015 --> 56:50.972
Hey!

56:54.715 --> 56:55.716
Hey!

56:57.805 --> 56:58.893
Shit.

57:02.331 --> 57:03.985
Don't worry,
I got you.

57:05.900 --> 57:07.946
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You have a better idea?

57:08.729 --> 57:10.035
Fuck. No.

57:16.868 --> 57:19.000
You have to come
one at a time.

57:19.174 --> 57:21.394
- You two go first. Mindy!
- What? No.

57:21.568 --> 57:22.917
Someone needs
to hold the door.

57:23.091 --> 57:25.398
I'll send Anika next. Go!

57:26.443 --> 57:28.793
Sam, come on.
Eyes on me, baby.

57:28.967 --> 57:30.359
Keep your eyes on me.

57:31.796 --> 57:32.797
Oh, shit.

57:34.015 --> 57:36.496
Oh, my God.[Danny] I got you, baby.

57:39.456 --> 57:40.761
Baby, come on!

57:41.762 --> 57:43.372
It won't hold me.

57:43.547 --> 57:45.113
Okay.

57:45.287 --> 57:47.333
It ain't going anywhere.
It's gonna hold you, I promise.

57:47.507 --> 57:48.508
Danny.

57:52.338 --> 57:54.601
I got you.
You ain't going nowhere.
Let's go.

57:54.775 --> 57:58.692
- She's losing a lot of blood!
- Say something more positive!

57:58.866 --> 58:01.216
Eyes on me, Sam.
Come on, baby.

58:01.390 --> 58:04.611
[Danny] Come on. I got you.

58:04.785 --> 58:06.265
Come on, I got you.

58:10.443 --> 58:11.270
Okay.

58:11.444 --> 58:12.793
- Come on!
- Let's go!

58:12.967 --> 58:15.187
- Come on, Mindy!
- Let's go, we got to move!

58:15.361 --> 58:16.797
Anika, come on!

58:18.582 --> 58:20.975
Anika![Danny] Go! Come on!

58:21.149 --> 58:23.195
You have to go first.[Anika whimpering] I can't.

58:24.152 --> 58:25.502
You have to go.

58:25.676 --> 58:28.287
Mindy, no! I'll be
right behind you, I promise.

58:32.726 --> 58:34.728
Mindy, come on.
You got to get over here!

58:34.902 --> 58:36.077
Let's go!

58:37.209 --> 58:39.690
We got you.[Sam] That's it. Mindy.

58:39.864 --> 58:41.822
Slow and steady.[Sam] We got you.

58:42.954 --> 58:44.912
Oh, God.

58:45.086 --> 58:48.829
Baby, you can't stop.[Sam] Get over here right now!

58:49.003 --> 58:51.484
Anika's coming right behind you.

58:55.793 --> 58:58.404
Anika, come on![Danny] Go!

58:58.578 --> 59:00.798
You can do it![Mindy] Come on, Anika!

59:00.972 --> 59:04.236
Oh, God!
I can't do it, I can't do it.

59:05.759 --> 59:07.805
Don't look down![Mindy] Look at me!

59:07.979 --> 59:11.025
You can do it!
You're doing good.

59:17.554 --> 59:18.816
What?

59:18.990 --> 59:20.600
Anika, you have to move
right now!

59:23.211 --> 59:24.386
No, God! Please, no!

59:24.561 --> 59:25.692
Anika, you got to move!

59:28.173 --> 59:29.174
No!

59:36.007 --> 59:37.574
You have to make it!

59:37.748 --> 59:39.314
Baby, I don't want to die!

59:39.488 --> 59:41.142
No, Anika.

59:45.146 --> 59:47.453
Anika, give me your hand.
I got you.

59:57.768 --> 59:59.857
No!

1:00:23.968 --> 1:00:26.057
So are you
pullin' anybody for interviews?

1:00:26.231 --> 1:00:27.841
How far along are you on that?

1:00:28.015 --> 1:00:29.321
Uh, just got two.

1:00:31.410 --> 1:00:32.541
Okay.

1:00:34.587 --> 1:00:36.415
Hey. You okay?

1:00:40.767 --> 1:00:42.464
This isn't your fault, Sam.

1:00:43.814 --> 1:00:44.815
But it is.

1:00:49.907 --> 1:00:51.691
Someone took our knives,

1:00:52.474 --> 1:00:54.128
so we couldn't fight back.

1:00:54.912 --> 1:00:56.653
I don't know
who I can trust.

1:00:59.046 --> 1:01:02.354
Then don't trust anyone.
Not your friends. Not me.

1:01:03.485 --> 1:01:04.965
Not anyone.

1:01:05.139 --> 1:01:07.272
I have
a few more questions for you.

1:01:09.187 --> 1:01:10.405
Just this way, Danny.

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:18.718
Chad.

1:01:21.895 --> 1:01:23.462
- Where were you?
- What? When?

1:01:23.636 --> 1:01:24.550
- Last night!
- What?

1:01:24.724 --> 1:01:25.943
I had Econ.
You know this.

1:01:26.117 --> 1:01:27.161
Bullshit, man!
You disappear,

1:01:27.335 --> 1:01:28.859
and my sister
almost gets killed!

1:01:29.033 --> 1:01:30.904
Dude, I was in a study hall
with a hundred other people.

1:01:31.078 --> 1:01:32.689
You can ask any of them.

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:34.691
Fuck, man.

1:01:36.475 --> 1:01:37.563
Oh, my God.

1:01:38.607 --> 1:01:40.827
Who?[Chad] Anika and Quinn.

1:01:42.786 --> 1:01:44.875
Mindy, I'm so sorry.

1:01:45.049 --> 1:01:46.572
Step the fuck back.

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:49.880
You're at the top of my list.

1:01:50.619 --> 1:01:51.882
I had Econ!

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.154
Go right ahead, sir.

1:02:08.202 --> 1:02:09.943
I'm gonna be right back.

1:02:17.429 --> 1:02:18.691
I'm really sorry
about Quinn.

1:02:20.301 --> 1:02:21.694
Thank you.

1:02:24.436 --> 1:02:26.090
Both my kids are gone.

1:02:27.134 --> 1:02:29.049
My whole family...

1:02:29.223 --> 1:02:30.529
...is gone.

1:02:34.968 --> 1:02:36.709
They took me
off the case.

1:02:36.883 --> 1:02:39.190
But I'm not gonna stop
until I find him.

1:02:40.104 --> 1:02:41.627
You fuck with my family...

1:02:43.063 --> 1:02:44.064
you die.

1:02:45.413 --> 1:02:46.719
Agreed.

1:02:46.893 --> 1:02:49.635
Hey, are you okay?
I came as soon as I heard.

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:51.115
Gale, I swear to God...

1:02:51.289 --> 1:02:54.074
Truce, okay?
I'm here for whatever you need.

1:02:54.248 --> 1:02:55.336
Okay. Nice try.

1:02:55.510 --> 1:02:56.990
Really, I am.

1:02:58.252 --> 1:03:00.037
Okay, fine.
Off the record, okay?

1:03:03.910 --> 1:03:05.738
Okay. Thank you.

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:11.962
I'm sorry I punched you.

1:03:12.658 --> 1:03:13.920
No, you're not.

1:03:14.094 --> 1:03:15.182
I'm not.

1:03:17.315 --> 1:03:19.273
You're the cop, right?

1:03:19.447 --> 1:03:21.319
I did some digging
on your first two victims

1:03:21.493 --> 1:03:22.624
and I found something.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:25.018
I know where the masks
are coming from.

1:03:25.192 --> 1:03:26.454
Show me.

1:03:26.628 --> 1:03:27.542
Ladies.

1:03:28.587 --> 1:03:29.806
Kirby?

1:03:30.589 --> 1:03:31.677
Gale.

1:03:31.851 --> 1:03:33.897
She's with the FBI.She's a child.

1:03:34.071 --> 1:03:36.116
When did they start
letting children into the FBI?

1:03:36.290 --> 1:03:39.119
- I'm 30.
- Well, you look like a zygote.

1:03:39.293 --> 1:03:40.599
I have a gun, Gale.

1:03:40.773 --> 1:03:43.297
Okay, fine. You're gonna
want to see this, too.

1:03:45.734 --> 1:03:48.650
Jason and Greg
were little Atlanta rich boys.

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:51.392
Apparently, they used
fake names to rent this place.

1:03:51.566 --> 1:03:53.090
How did you find it?

1:03:53.264 --> 1:03:56.006
It's called
"investigative journalism"
for a reason.

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:59.836
How didn't you find it?
Weren't you tracking them?

1:04:00.010 --> 1:04:02.708
I went through
their financial records
dozens of times.

1:04:02.882 --> 1:04:05.580
This was not in any of them.
Doesn't make sense.

1:04:05.754 --> 1:04:07.234
Don't worry.

1:04:07.408 --> 1:04:09.323
I'm just really good at my job.
You'll get there.

1:04:22.293 --> 1:04:25.949
What is this place?
What's with all the security?

1:04:29.561 --> 1:04:30.910
It's a movie theater.

1:04:31.084 --> 1:04:32.607
It's not just a theater.

1:04:33.434 --> 1:04:34.827
It's a shrine.

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:52.845
Whoa.

1:05:08.339 --> 1:05:11.211
They've got
the whole goddamn franchise.

1:05:26.270 --> 1:05:27.793
- Chad?
- Mmm?

1:05:28.446 --> 1:05:29.838
This was Uncle Randy's.

1:05:31.014 --> 1:05:32.406
They've got everything.

1:05:35.757 --> 1:05:37.716
Is that--The knife I was stabbed with.

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:40.023
You all have been through
so much.

1:05:41.502 --> 1:05:43.635
Who drew all these?

1:05:57.605 --> 1:05:58.737
Dewey.

1:05:58.911 --> 1:06:00.957
Hey, how'd they get
all this stuff?

1:06:02.175 --> 1:06:03.524
Isn't this evidence?

1:06:03.698 --> 1:06:05.439
Well, cops like money,

1:06:05.613 --> 1:06:08.834
and evidence can get lost
pretty easily.

1:06:10.618 --> 1:06:12.794
Present company excluded,
of course.

1:06:15.145 --> 1:06:18.365
Um, why am I here exactly?
My alibi checks out.

1:06:18.539 --> 1:06:21.151
So I can keep an eye on you, roomie.

1:06:22.282 --> 1:06:23.544
The killer must have
found this place

1:06:23.718 --> 1:06:25.459
before he murdered Jason
and Greg.

1:06:25.633 --> 1:06:28.593
And then he took the masks
off the mannequins.

1:06:28.767 --> 1:06:31.900
All nine, from Stu and Billy
to Amber and Richie.

1:06:57.622 --> 1:07:00.712
Hot damn!
How fucking cool is this place?

1:07:00.886 --> 1:07:02.105
Fuck, no.

1:07:02.279 --> 1:07:03.367
Fuck, yes.

1:07:03.541 --> 1:07:05.325
Come on, Sam,
you got to be excited

1:07:05.499 --> 1:07:08.111
to get our murder on again. Together.

1:07:08.285 --> 1:07:11.244
Billy and Sam.
Team Loomis.

1:07:11.418 --> 1:07:14.682
Get ready to slice up
more motherfuckers.

1:07:25.258 --> 1:07:26.781
What are you doing?

1:07:31.264 --> 1:07:32.657
I don't know.

1:07:37.140 --> 1:07:38.793
So,

1:07:38.967 --> 1:07:41.187
somebody killed
these chucklefucks

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:43.537
and took over?

1:07:43.711 --> 1:07:46.584
Someone who believes that Sam
masterminded Woodsboro.

1:07:46.758 --> 1:07:48.194
If this were
a normal <i>Stab</i> movie,

1:07:48.368 --> 1:07:50.066
this would be the killer's lair.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:52.764
Which means this isn't
a normal <i>Stab</i> movie.

1:08:08.823 --> 1:08:11.435
The TV that killed Stu Macher.

1:08:11.609 --> 1:08:13.263
If you believe he's dead.

1:08:15.352 --> 1:08:17.223
I hear
you're a horror fan.

1:08:18.006 --> 1:08:19.486
- It's been said.
- Mmm.

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:20.792
Mmm.

1:08:20.966 --> 1:08:22.750
Best <i>Nightmare
on Elm Street?</i>

1:08:22.924 --> 1:08:24.361
The original.

1:08:24.535 --> 1:08:26.232
Best <i>Friday the 13th?</i>

1:08:26.406 --> 1:08:27.668
Part II.The Final Chapter.

1:08:29.409 --> 1:08:30.671
Had a crush
on Corey Feldman.

1:08:30.845 --> 1:08:32.456
Okay. Respect.

1:08:33.848 --> 1:08:34.762
<i>Psycho II</i> is...

1:08:34.936 --> 1:08:36.024
...underrated.

1:08:37.287 --> 1:08:40.072
<i>Candyman.</i>
The original or requel?

1:08:40.246 --> 1:08:41.160
Both.

1:08:42.683 --> 1:08:44.729
Okay. Okay.

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:46.513
Game recognize game.

1:08:47.862 --> 1:08:49.168
Hmm.

1:08:53.694 --> 1:08:55.131
You okay?

1:08:58.003 --> 1:09:00.266
Sam, when do I get
to be a normal person again?

1:09:03.269 --> 1:09:04.444
I don't know.

1:09:04.618 --> 1:09:06.533
I don't want
to be a part of this.

1:09:07.839 --> 1:09:09.667
I don't want to be a part
of some stupid legacy

1:09:09.841 --> 1:09:11.408
because I'm--Because of me.

1:09:14.106 --> 1:09:16.195
I'm sorry.

1:09:16.369 --> 1:09:17.588
Just drop it, Sam.

1:09:19.459 --> 1:09:20.460
Tara.

1:09:21.374 --> 1:09:22.332
I got her.

1:09:27.337 --> 1:09:28.729
That seemed intense.

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:32.777
Ever since I came back
into her life, I've just...

1:09:35.693 --> 1:09:37.129
made a mess of it.

1:09:37.651 --> 1:09:38.696
Hey.

1:09:38.870 --> 1:09:40.611
Where's your mother
in all this?

1:09:40.785 --> 1:09:44.136
She cut me off
when I told Tara
about Billy.

1:09:45.006 --> 1:09:46.094
Then Tara cut her off

1:09:46.269 --> 1:09:48.706
because she wouldn't
talk to me,

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:51.317
so now neither of us
have a mother.

1:09:51.491 --> 1:09:53.885
I'm sorry to say this,
but fuck her.

1:09:54.755 --> 1:09:56.192
My parents sucked, too.

1:09:58.019 --> 1:10:00.239
But you can still
make your own family.

1:10:00.413 --> 1:10:02.720
Even if it's just
with one person.

1:10:06.898 --> 1:10:09.292
And if you lose
that one person?

1:10:11.294 --> 1:10:12.860
You just-- You keep going.

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:15.515
And maybe
you find another loner,

1:10:15.689 --> 1:10:17.561
and you look after each other.

1:10:26.004 --> 1:10:28.049
How'd you get past
what happened to you?

1:10:33.446 --> 1:10:35.361
I almost died
after I was stabbed.

1:10:37.189 --> 1:10:38.625
Technically, I did die.

1:10:38.799 --> 1:10:40.279
For four minutes.

1:10:43.413 --> 1:10:44.588
When I recovered...

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:47.678
I got mad.

1:10:47.852 --> 1:10:51.508
I didn't want
to spend the rest of my life
being afraid of monsters.

1:10:53.292 --> 1:10:55.773
I wanted the monsters
to be afraid of me.

1:10:57.035 --> 1:10:58.341
I like that.

1:10:58.515 --> 1:11:00.647
[Bailey] Sorry to interrupt.

1:11:01.561 --> 1:11:02.780
Think I might have an idea

1:11:02.954 --> 1:11:04.216
about how to turn the tables
on this creep.

1:11:04.390 --> 1:11:06.218
Yeah. We're in.

1:11:06.392 --> 1:11:08.481
Sorry, Gale.
No press allowed.

1:11:08.655 --> 1:11:10.875
Police business.
I'm good at my job, too.

1:11:17.795 --> 1:11:19.405
You should have stayed
with the others.

1:11:19.579 --> 1:11:21.189
That's not gonna happen.

1:11:21.364 --> 1:11:24.410
There's no point in both of us
putting ourselves at risk.

1:11:24.584 --> 1:11:27.283
I'm not.
I'm your backup.

1:11:31.722 --> 1:11:33.680
So we're really doing
the phone tracing thing

1:11:33.854 --> 1:11:35.552
that never works
in the movies.

1:11:35.726 --> 1:11:37.554
It'll be all, "Keep him talking,
Sam. Two more minutes,

1:11:37.728 --> 1:11:39.251
I've almost got him."

1:11:39.425 --> 1:11:41.427
And then he hangs up just
before we can get a lock.

1:11:41.601 --> 1:11:45.083
I can trace a call
in under 15 seconds.

1:11:47.390 --> 1:11:50.393
Well, you've got them
out there as bait.

1:11:50.567 --> 1:11:52.395
Because the killer usually calls
from somewhere nearby.

1:11:52.569 --> 1:11:54.701
And you think they're safe
because it's broad daylight

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:56.050
in a public place?

1:11:56.224 --> 1:11:58.357
Look, I am here, okay?
And so is Bailey.

1:11:58.531 --> 1:12:01.055
This is exactly
how our Uncle Randy died.

1:12:01.229 --> 1:12:02.840
Broad daylight.
Public place.

1:12:03.014 --> 1:12:05.930
Yanked into a van.
Stab, stab, stab. No more Randy.

1:12:07.061 --> 1:12:08.106
Huh.

1:12:11.849 --> 1:12:14.852
Hey, Sam?
Stay frosty out there, okay?

1:12:15.026 --> 1:12:16.027
We're good.

1:12:39.877 --> 1:12:41.226
You're gonna die,
you know.

1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:43.184
<i>No, you're gonna die, Samantha!</i>

1:12:43.359 --> 1:12:46.884
<i>Choking on your own blood
while I hack up your sister.</i>

1:12:47.798 --> 1:12:49.495
Unless we find you first.

1:12:49.669 --> 1:12:52.759
<i>For a mastermind,
you're not very bright.</i>

1:12:52.933 --> 1:12:54.457
<i>Waiting for me to call,</i>

1:12:54.631 --> 1:12:57.373
<i>desperately hoping I'm nearby
so the police can grab me?</i>

1:13:00.114 --> 1:13:03.291
<i>But I'm not nearby.
I'm a step ahead.</i>

1:13:03.466 --> 1:13:06.251
<i>Be seeing you, Samantha.</i>

1:13:08.209 --> 1:13:12.083
- Did you get it?
- Yep. Geolocation
coming through right now.

1:13:14.346 --> 1:13:15.739
He's on the Upper West Side.

1:13:15.913 --> 1:13:17.828
<i>He's inside
an apartment building,</i>

1:13:18.002 --> 1:13:19.177
<i>halfway across the city.</i>

1:13:19.351 --> 1:13:21.745
- On West 96th?
- How did you know that?

1:13:25.575 --> 1:13:26.750
Gale.

1:13:27.533 --> 1:13:29.666
"No press."

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:33.104
Bitch, last time I saw you,
you were in glee club.

1:13:33.278 --> 1:13:35.933
Forgive me if I don't trust you
to keep them safe.

1:13:36.107 --> 1:13:38.414
- Here you go, baby.
- Thanks.

1:13:38.588 --> 1:13:40.198
My friend Danny works
on the Upper West Side.

1:13:40.372 --> 1:13:41.417
He can get there quicker.

1:13:41.591 --> 1:13:42.505
Yeah,
or he could finish her off.

1:13:42.679 --> 1:13:44.376
Is it possible he's the killer?

1:13:44.550 --> 1:13:46.030
Fuck.
We have to get there now.

1:13:46.204 --> 1:13:47.814
It's 50 blocks away.
We don't even know if it's true.

1:13:47.988 --> 1:13:50.077
- Sam, wait! Take a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

1:13:50.251 --> 1:13:51.949
You have to trust me,
we got to make the right call.

1:13:52.123 --> 1:13:53.559
He's already--[Tara] Sam!

1:13:53.733 --> 1:13:54.734
Get in.

1:13:54.908 --> 1:13:56.649
What's she doing?

1:13:56.823 --> 1:13:58.564
Hey, get out of my car!

1:13:58.738 --> 1:14:01.437
What do you think you're doing?
That's an official vehicle! Hey!

1:14:01.611 --> 1:14:02.742
Should we use the sirens?

1:14:02.916 --> 1:14:04.048
Did you think
we'd steal a police car

1:14:04.222 --> 1:14:05.266
and not use the sirens?

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:06.790
- Do you have a license?
- Fuck, yeah.

1:14:06.964 --> 1:14:08.748
What are you doing?

1:14:08.922 --> 1:14:11.577
It's a cop car!
You can't steal a cop car!

1:14:14.711 --> 1:14:16.408
That'll be our food.

1:14:18.758 --> 1:14:19.759
Hello?

1:14:20.934 --> 1:14:22.458
Not the food. It's for you.

1:14:23.546 --> 1:14:24.460
Who is it?

1:14:24.634 --> 1:14:26.157
May I ask who's calling, please?

1:14:28.159 --> 1:14:29.508
He says it's the killer.

1:14:37.037 --> 1:14:39.431
Hello?[Ghostface] <i>Hello, Gale.</i>

1:14:39.605 --> 1:14:42.652
<i>Strange that you and I
have never spoken on the phone.</i>

1:14:42.826 --> 1:14:44.828
<i>This is long overdue.</i>

1:14:45.437 --> 1:14:46.394
I agree.

1:14:46.569 --> 1:14:48.005
Call the police.

1:14:48.179 --> 1:14:50.834
<i>I figured
after all these years</i>

1:14:51.008 --> 1:14:53.401
<i>you'd want an interview.</i>

1:14:53.576 --> 1:14:55.795
Well, you figured right.

1:14:57.536 --> 1:15:00.452
So, what's your motive
this time?

1:15:00.626 --> 1:15:03.629
You angry at the movies or you
just trying to stay relevant?

1:15:03.803 --> 1:15:05.805
<i>I could ask you the same.</i>

1:15:05.979 --> 1:15:09.417
<i>Don't you know
the legacy characters
are disposable now?</i>

1:15:09.592 --> 1:15:12.072
<i>Nobody cares
about last century's heroes.</i>

1:15:12.246 --> 1:15:15.467
Then why bother with me at all?
<i>Call it nostalgia.</i>

1:15:15.641 --> 1:15:17.425
<i>Or maybe
you deserve to be punished</i>

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:20.167
<i>for all that money you made
off the misery of others.</i>

1:15:20.341 --> 1:15:25.303
<i>Maybe it's time
someone made a buck
reporting your death.</i>

1:15:25.477 --> 1:15:27.958
You know you're like the tenth
guy to try this, right?

1:15:28.785 --> 1:15:30.395
And spoiler alert,

1:15:30.569 --> 1:15:33.703
it never works out
for the dipshit in the mask.

1:15:35.661 --> 1:15:38.925
<i>Oh, but they certainly
leave a mark
before they go, don't they?</i>

1:15:39.099 --> 1:15:42.146
<i>Richie and Amber
managed to butcher Dewey.</i>

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:45.149
<i>Carved him up
like a Christmas goose.</i>

1:15:45.323 --> 1:15:49.327
<i>How does it feel
to lose the only man
who ever loved you?</i>

1:15:49.501 --> 1:15:50.720
Fuck you!

1:15:50.894 --> 1:15:52.156
<i>How does it feel to know</i>

1:15:52.330 --> 1:15:54.767
<i>that you weren't
there for him at the end?</i>

1:15:54.941 --> 1:15:58.466
<i>Not there to give him comfort</i>

1:15:58.641 --> 1:16:00.904
<i>as he died screaming
in his own guts.</i>

1:16:01.078 --> 1:16:03.297
You're the one
who's gonna die screaming.

1:16:03.471 --> 1:16:06.866
<i>Maybe. But you won't
be around to see it.</i>

1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:09.173
<i>You couldn't stop
what happened to Dewey.</i>

1:16:09.347 --> 1:16:11.392
<i>Just like you're not
gonna be able to stop this.</i>

1:16:47.603 --> 1:16:49.561
Oh, God!

1:17:13.890 --> 1:17:16.675
How's that for nostalgia, fucker?

1:17:29.601 --> 1:17:31.081
<i>You missed.</i>

1:17:31.255 --> 1:17:32.256
Sure I did.

1:17:32.430 --> 1:17:33.866
<i>You win.</i>

1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:35.651
<i>I'm in the elevator
heading for the ground floor.</i>

1:17:36.608 --> 1:17:37.870
Sure you are.

1:17:41.744 --> 1:17:43.006
<i>Maybe you did hit me.</i>

1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:44.660
<i>Maybe I'm wounded.</i>

1:17:44.834 --> 1:17:47.750
<i>Or maybe I'm wearing
a bulletproof vest.</i>

1:17:47.924 --> 1:17:50.840
That's why I'm gonna shoot you
in the fucking head!

1:18:03.679 --> 1:18:06.464
<i>You would've made
a good killer, Gale.</i>

1:18:06.638 --> 1:18:09.554
<i>Sidney never would've
made sense, and Dewey
was the fan favorite.</i>

1:18:09.728 --> 1:18:11.948
<i>But you
cracking under the pressure</i>

1:18:12.122 --> 1:18:15.603
<i>and turning into Ghostface
would've been a great twist.</i>

1:18:15.778 --> 1:18:17.257
Keep talking, asshole.

1:18:17.431 --> 1:18:21.871
<i>Sure.
What do you want to talk about?</i>

1:18:25.091 --> 1:18:27.398
<i>You never got to be
the leading lady, did you?</i>

1:18:27.572 --> 1:18:30.706
<i>It was always all about
poor sweet Sidney,</i>

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.620
<i>sucking up all the oxygen.</i>

1:18:32.795 --> 1:18:34.622
<i>What did that leave you
to be?</i>

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:36.537
The brains
and the sex appeal.

1:18:38.017 --> 1:18:39.758
<i>Sorry about your boyfriend.</i>

1:18:39.932 --> 1:18:43.022
<i>All those muscles
didn't help much.</i>

1:18:43.196 --> 1:18:44.197
They sure didn't.

1:18:47.418 --> 1:18:48.462
Can you hold, please?

1:18:48.636 --> 1:18:50.943
<i>Huh?</i>

1:20:13.069 --> 1:20:14.461
Fuck you!

1:20:14.635 --> 1:20:16.463
Hey, fuckface!

1:20:21.642 --> 1:20:23.209
Gale!

1:20:24.123 --> 1:20:25.777
Oh, shit. Gale?

1:20:27.083 --> 1:20:28.301
Gale.

1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:31.261
Sorry.

1:20:31.435 --> 1:20:32.784
I'm sorry.

1:20:34.264 --> 1:20:36.005
I should've known that he was
gonna come after you.

1:20:36.179 --> 1:20:38.224
I'm so sorry.

1:20:39.225 --> 1:20:40.661
He didn't get me.

1:20:43.273 --> 1:20:44.317
Tell Sidney

1:20:45.362 --> 1:20:46.885
he never got me.

1:20:52.630 --> 1:20:53.674
Gale?

1:20:56.329 --> 1:20:57.591
- Gale.
- Gale.

1:20:57.765 --> 1:20:59.071
Gale? Please.

1:20:59.245 --> 1:21:00.594
Out of the way!

1:21:00.768 --> 1:21:03.902
- Out of the way!
- Move. You got to move. Move!

1:21:04.076 --> 1:21:05.512
No! No!

1:21:05.686 --> 1:21:07.601
Okay. Get them back,
please.[Tara] Sam, please!

1:21:07.775 --> 1:21:10.474
- They need to move now.
- Excuse me. Please step back.

1:21:10.648 --> 1:21:13.216
Call it in.[paramedic 2] Right away.

1:21:14.739 --> 1:21:17.133
Checking.[Tara] Come on, Gale.

1:21:20.266 --> 1:21:22.355
Got a weak pulse.
Get the backboard.

1:21:22.529 --> 1:21:24.444
We need to move now.[paramedic 2] Yeah.

1:21:27.404 --> 1:21:29.536
Backboard! Let's move.

1:21:42.332 --> 1:21:44.769
Hey. Hey.

1:21:44.943 --> 1:21:46.466
I got here as fast as I could.

1:21:48.599 --> 1:21:49.861
Did you?

1:21:51.471 --> 1:21:53.125
I'm scared,
you guys.

1:21:53.299 --> 1:21:55.258
I really don't want
to get hurt again.

1:21:56.302 --> 1:21:57.303
Neither do I.

1:21:59.001 --> 1:22:00.524
I don't want you
getting hurt again, either.

1:22:00.698 --> 1:22:02.569
I know. I know.

1:22:08.662 --> 1:22:09.968
So what do we do now?

1:22:11.927 --> 1:22:13.885
Maybe he gets to win this time.

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:19.238
He wants to punish me.

1:22:22.024 --> 1:22:23.025
Me.

1:22:25.027 --> 1:22:27.116
So maybe I let him.

1:22:27.290 --> 1:22:29.596
I'll just give myself up.

1:22:30.902 --> 1:22:32.730
If this is what I have to do

1:22:33.861 --> 1:22:35.341
to keep you safe,

1:22:36.647 --> 1:22:37.735
it's worth it.

1:22:37.909 --> 1:22:39.737
No, we're not doing that, Sam.

1:22:39.911 --> 1:22:42.218
You went back to Woodsboro
to protect me.

1:22:42.392 --> 1:22:44.698
Every single day, you make
the decision to protect me.

1:22:44.872 --> 1:22:47.571
None of us would even be alive
if it weren't for you.

1:22:47.745 --> 1:22:49.965
You have to let us
protect you this time.

1:22:51.227 --> 1:22:52.445
- No.
- Yes.

1:22:54.230 --> 1:22:55.796
We're a team, remember?

1:22:55.971 --> 1:22:57.276
Actually,

1:22:58.321 --> 1:22:59.322
we're a family.

1:22:59.496 --> 1:23:02.194
Let's go! Core Four!
Come on.

1:23:02.368 --> 1:23:03.761
- Core Four.
- Come on.

1:23:03.935 --> 1:23:05.502
- Core what?
- It's an us thing.

1:23:07.504 --> 1:23:09.332
He's gonna keep
coming after us.

1:23:09.506 --> 1:23:12.813
Isn't there somewhere safe
we could just hole up in?

1:23:12.988 --> 1:23:14.641
No, he's gonna keep finding us.

1:23:14.815 --> 1:23:15.947
Great.

1:23:18.950 --> 1:23:19.995
We could use that, though.

1:23:23.085 --> 1:23:27.002
I'm getting my ass chewed out
for not dropping the case
and now you want me to do what?

1:23:27.176 --> 1:23:29.743
We want to lure him
to a secure location
and trap him inside.

1:23:31.049 --> 1:23:32.050
And then what?

1:23:33.704 --> 1:23:34.748
We execute him.

1:23:40.363 --> 1:23:41.842
Are you gonna help us?

1:23:44.367 --> 1:23:45.933
Let's kill
the son of a bitch.

1:23:46.108 --> 1:23:47.805
<i>Now, I'm stuck here,</i>

1:23:47.979 --> 1:23:49.502
<i>but Gale gave us
the keycards to the theater.</i>

1:23:49.676 --> 1:23:51.722
It's got heavy surveillance
and security cameras,

1:23:51.896 --> 1:23:54.072
but we can use that against him.

1:23:54.246 --> 1:23:55.465
<i>I'll tell Kirby
to meet you there.</i>

1:23:55.639 --> 1:23:57.162
<i>I'll join you
as soon as I can.</i>

1:23:57.336 --> 1:23:59.686
- Got it.
- And remember, travel in public.

1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:01.775
The more people around you,
the less chance he has

1:24:01.949 --> 1:24:04.169
<i>to take a shot at you
before you get there.</i>

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:11.742
Is this even a good plan?

1:24:11.916 --> 1:24:14.049
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

1:24:14.223 --> 1:24:16.703
So we just peel off
and the killer picks us off
one by one? No, thank you.

1:24:16.877 --> 1:24:19.141
Let's just get to the theater.
Come on, in here.

1:24:19.315 --> 1:24:20.881
Yes, because it'll be
much less scary

1:24:21.056 --> 1:24:23.101
at the serial killer
movie theater.

1:24:23.275 --> 1:24:24.276
Fuck.

1:24:25.451 --> 1:24:27.192
Wait, hey, hey! Chad!

1:24:27.366 --> 1:24:29.020
Hey! Fuck! Chad!

1:24:30.152 --> 1:24:31.196
Tara!

1:24:32.763 --> 1:24:34.939
- Wait, where's Mindy?
- Chad! Sam! Hey, Sam!

1:24:35.113 --> 1:24:37.028
Mindy! Mindy! Mindy!

1:24:38.595 --> 1:24:40.075
Let's go. Shit.

1:24:40.249 --> 1:24:41.337
Fuck!

1:24:46.516 --> 1:24:47.517
Fuck.

1:24:56.178 --> 1:24:58.615
Get your Ghostface ass
away from me, Ghostface.

1:25:02.706 --> 1:25:04.751
<i>The next local one train</i>

1:25:04.925 --> 1:25:06.927
<i>to South Ferry
will arrive in...</i>

1:25:07.102 --> 1:25:08.015
Go away.

1:25:08.190 --> 1:25:09.626
<i>...five minutes.</i>

1:25:15.327 --> 1:25:17.242
- Where's Mindy?
- She missed the train.

1:25:17.416 --> 1:25:19.636
I was gonna wait for her,
but Cute Boy here dragged me on.

1:25:19.810 --> 1:25:21.638
- Trying to keep us together.
- By pulling us apart?

1:25:24.467 --> 1:25:25.424
It's okay.

1:25:25.598 --> 1:25:27.165
It's fine. She's with Ethan.

1:25:27.339 --> 1:25:29.559
She'll meet us there.

1:25:29.733 --> 1:25:31.865
<i>This is a South Ferry bound</i>

1:25:32.039 --> 1:25:33.040

1:25:33.215 --> 1:25:34.129
Oh, shit.

1:25:34.303 --> 1:25:37.044
<i>The next stop is 79th Street.</i>

1:25:48.186 --> 1:25:49.666
How many stops do we have?

1:25:54.410 --> 1:25:55.846
Ten.

1:26:31.142 --> 1:26:33.449
<i>This is 79th Street.</i>

1:26:47.985 --> 1:26:52.032

<i>The next stop is 79th Street.</i>

1:27:29.156 --> 1:27:30.462
Sorry!

1:27:53.746 --> 1:27:55.270
Still nothing from Mindy.

1:27:55.444 --> 1:27:58.534
<i>This is 72nd Street.</i>

1:28:06.977 --> 1:28:08.021
Guys?

1:28:11.198 --> 1:28:12.112
Dude!

1:28:13.375 --> 1:28:14.985
Watch yourself, man.

Shit, shit. Mindy!

Fuck,
that's a lot of blood.

1:30:46.397 --> 1:30:48.399
Help! Somebody help!

1:30:48.573 --> 1:30:50.793
Fuck. We got to get you
out of here, okay?

1:30:52.490 --> 1:30:53.404
Damn it.

1:30:53.578 --> 1:30:55.406
Come on![Mindy] Fuck.

1:30:55.580 --> 1:30:57.887
Shit. Somebody call 911!

1:31:02.152 --> 1:31:04.284
Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I'm so good.
- Are you okay?

1:31:04.459 --> 1:31:06.591
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1:31:06.765 --> 1:31:09.899
Goddamn it.
I got it wrong again.

1:31:10.465 --> 1:31:11.596
What the fuck?

1:31:11.770 --> 1:31:12.989
Help!

1:31:13.163 --> 1:31:14.294
We need medical assistance.

1:31:14.469 --> 1:31:15.687
We're at
the 66th Street station.

1:31:15.861 --> 1:31:17.472
Fuck this franchise.

1:31:26.219 --> 1:31:27.264
Hey.

1:31:28.874 --> 1:31:32.269
I talked to Bailey.
I've got everything set up.

1:31:32.443 --> 1:31:34.967
- Where are Mindy and Ethan?
- They're five minutes
behind us.

1:31:35.141 --> 1:31:37.622
Let's get you
all inside.

1:31:38.667 --> 1:31:40.364
- Not you.
- What?

1:31:42.497 --> 1:31:43.976
Don't trust anyone, remember?

1:31:45.412 --> 1:31:46.544
We don't know you.

1:31:48.154 --> 1:31:49.199
Not really.

1:31:50.287 --> 1:31:51.244
You know me.

1:31:51.418 --> 1:31:53.246
You're not Woodsboro.

1:31:55.727 --> 1:31:56.815
I'm sorry.

1:31:57.903 --> 1:32:00.732
It's okay.
It's okay, I get it.

1:32:02.647 --> 1:32:03.866
Be safe, okay?

1:32:05.302 --> 1:32:06.433
Okay?

1:32:07.434 --> 1:32:08.479
You, too.

1:32:11.787 --> 1:32:12.701
Good call.

1:32:17.270 --> 1:32:19.577
I cleared the whole place
before you got here.

1:32:21.274 --> 1:32:23.886
So, this is the only way
in or out.

1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:25.670
He steps in
through the first door,

1:32:25.844 --> 1:32:28.543
both doors lock automatically,
trapping him inside.

1:32:28.717 --> 1:32:30.675
We turn it into a kill box.

1:32:30.849 --> 1:32:34.505
- Weapons?
- One gun,
and I hold onto it.

1:32:34.679 --> 1:32:36.159
I am the only one
with a badge here

1:32:36.333 --> 1:32:37.726
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

1:32:39.292 --> 1:32:40.642
We're safe here.

1:32:43.906 --> 1:32:47.126
I'm gonna check in with Mindy.
See if they're close.

1:33:08.539 --> 1:33:09.975
Come on, come on.

1:33:10.149 --> 1:33:12.978
<i>Hey, you've reached me.
Leave a message.</i>

1:33:13.152 --> 1:33:14.763
You know you're not safe here.

1:33:14.937 --> 1:33:16.591
Whenever someone says,
"We're safe here,"

1:33:16.765 --> 1:33:18.288
it means you're not.[Sam] Not now.

1:33:18.462 --> 1:33:20.507
But you're smarter than this, Sam.

1:33:20.682 --> 1:33:22.858
Grab a weapon
and clear this place yourself.

1:33:25.382 --> 1:33:26.688
You know I'm right.

1:33:42.965 --> 1:33:44.444
Excellent choice.

1:33:46.795 --> 1:33:48.057
My favorite.

1:33:51.147 --> 1:33:52.148
Kirby?

1:33:57.022 --> 1:33:58.023
Kirby!

1:34:18.827 --> 1:34:20.524
Hello?

1:34:20.698 --> 1:34:22.569
Get everyone out of there, Sam.
You're not safe.

1:34:22.744 --> 1:34:24.441
<i>I heard
from the Atlanta field office.</i>

1:34:24.615 --> 1:34:26.835
<i>They said Agent Reed's been
on a downward spiral</i>

1:34:27.009 --> 1:34:29.707
<i>ever since the Woodsboro
- murders last year.
- What are you talking about?</i>

1:34:29.881 --> 1:34:32.754
They fired Kirby two months ago
for being mentally unstable.

1:34:32.928 --> 1:34:35.408
<i>What?</i> She's no longer with the FBI.

1:34:49.248 --> 1:34:50.597
<i>Listen, asshole.</i>

1:34:50.772 --> 1:34:52.164
<i>No, you listen,
you little bitch.</i>

1:34:52.338 --> 1:34:54.558
<i>Hang up on me, I'll gut you
like a fish. Understand?</i>

1:34:54.732 --> 1:34:55.994
<i>What do you want?</i>

1:34:56.168 --> 1:34:58.693
<i>To see
what your insides look like.</i>

1:35:02.914 --> 1:35:04.524
Oh, shit.

1:35:12.663 --> 1:35:14.883
When was the last time
anybody used this place?

1:35:15.057 --> 1:35:16.711
It's so old.

1:35:20.758 --> 1:35:23.892
Um. I'm sorry,
you can have them.

1:35:24.066 --> 1:35:25.676
- Take them.
- No, I mean...

1:35:25.850 --> 1:35:27.634
If you want them,
you have them.

1:35:27.809 --> 1:35:28.897
- You think I want these?
- Kind of.

1:35:29.071 --> 1:35:31.203
They're a hundred years old.

1:35:31.377 --> 1:35:32.727
Maybe that's your thing.

1:35:38.994 --> 1:35:39.995
I actually--

1:35:52.224 --> 1:35:55.097
It's maybe embarrassing
how long I've wanted to do that.

1:35:55.271 --> 1:35:57.273
Yeah, you should've done that
a lot sooner.

1:35:57.447 --> 1:35:58.709
I know.

1:35:58.883 --> 1:36:01.146
But you could also do it
a lot more times.

1:36:04.193 --> 1:36:05.890
Tara!

1:36:16.248 --> 1:36:18.816
Tara, let's go.
Come on, come on!

1:36:20.296 --> 1:36:22.124
Come on, go, go, go!

1:36:22.298 --> 1:36:24.996
It's Kirby. She's the killer.[Chad] No shit!

1:36:25.170 --> 1:36:27.477
- That's locked. Come on.
- Are we trapped?

1:36:27.651 --> 1:36:30.088
She made this whole theater
a kill box. For us.

1:36:30.262 --> 1:36:32.874
Hey, what about that?
There's an exit door.

1:36:33.918 --> 1:36:35.137
Maybe it leads to the roof
or something?

1:36:35.311 --> 1:36:37.139
There's only one way
to find out. Let's go.

1:36:37.313 --> 1:36:38.401
Bailey's on the way, but--

1:36:42.231 --> 1:36:43.493
Oh, fuck!

1:36:45.408 --> 1:36:46.365
Beheadings!

1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:49.847
Tara! Come on.

1:36:50.021 --> 1:36:51.893
Smile for the camera,
motherfucker!

1:36:56.375 --> 1:36:57.550
This way! Come on!

1:36:57.724 --> 1:36:59.552
<i>She should
be running out the front door.</i>

1:37:05.558 --> 1:37:06.646
Get fucked!

1:37:24.099 --> 1:37:25.927
Tara, go! Go!

1:37:32.977 --> 1:37:34.283
No!

1:37:34.892 --> 1:37:35.893
Chad!

1:37:39.244 --> 1:37:40.593
Run.

1:37:42.508 --> 1:37:43.553
Go.

1:37:53.911 --> 1:37:55.913
This way. Up here. Come on.

1:38:00.352 --> 1:38:01.876
<i>Everybody's a suspect.</i>

1:38:03.790 --> 1:38:06.576
<i>You're not scared, are you?</i>

1:38:09.318 --> 1:38:10.885
Oh, Sam!

1:38:11.059 --> 1:38:13.931
<i>It's a lot scarier
when there's no motive.</i>

1:38:14.105 --> 1:38:15.715
Ready?

1:38:15.890 --> 1:38:17.630
I need you to be ready. Ready?

1:38:18.980 --> 1:38:19.981
Look at me.

1:38:21.504 --> 1:38:22.853
I'm ready.

1:38:23.027 --> 1:38:25.334
Come on, motherfucker!

1:38:27.945 --> 1:38:29.555
It's okay!

1:38:29.729 --> 1:38:32.428
- Stay the fuck back!
- We know it's you, Kirby.

1:38:33.646 --> 1:38:36.258
One of them knocked me out.

1:38:36.432 --> 1:38:37.346
Kirby, stop!

1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:39.174
Get away from the girls!

1:38:41.132 --> 1:38:42.438
What are you doing?

1:38:42.612 --> 1:38:44.657
Did you kill Quinn?
Did you kill my daughter?

1:38:44.831 --> 1:38:46.224
Jesus Christ!

1:38:48.313 --> 1:38:51.273
Whatever he's been saying
to you, don't listen to him.

1:38:51.447 --> 1:38:53.144
He's probably the killer.

1:38:54.058 --> 1:38:55.538
Behind you!

1:39:05.026 --> 1:39:06.027
Great job.

1:39:10.901 --> 1:39:11.946
Both of you.

1:39:13.773 --> 1:39:15.384
- You?
- Yeah, of course me.

1:39:15.558 --> 1:39:17.864
Frankly, I expected more
from the two of you

1:39:18.039 --> 1:39:19.040
after what you did to us.

1:39:19.214 --> 1:39:20.302
What do you mean, "us"?

1:39:26.003 --> 1:39:27.787
Ta-da!

1:39:27.962 --> 1:39:29.528
Mindy was right.

1:39:29.702 --> 1:39:31.617
It was easy to juke
the roommate lottery.

1:39:31.791 --> 1:39:33.315
All I had to do to meet you

1:39:33.489 --> 1:39:36.666
was room with a conceited,
condescending alpha

1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:38.668
literally named Chad.

1:39:38.842 --> 1:39:40.583
Fuck,
it felt good to kill him!

1:39:42.019 --> 1:39:43.803
This was your grandmother's,
Sam.

1:39:44.630 --> 1:39:46.023
Nancy Loomis?

1:39:46.197 --> 1:39:48.286
Really runs in
your fucking family, doesn't it?

1:39:48.460 --> 1:39:50.549
Speaking of family... Wait for it.

1:39:50.723 --> 1:39:52.638
...my name's
not Ethan Landry,

1:39:52.812 --> 1:39:53.857
is it, Dad?

1:39:55.337 --> 1:39:56.903
"Dad"?

1:39:57.078 --> 1:40:00.037
Wait. If it's you two,
that just leaves...

1:40:02.997 --> 1:40:03.998
Mindy?

1:40:12.223 --> 1:40:13.746
Hey, roomies.

1:40:15.009 --> 1:40:16.488
You didn't see
that one coming, did you?

1:40:16.662 --> 1:40:19.926
- Yeah, because you died!
- Kind of didn't, though.

1:40:20.101 --> 1:40:22.581
It was a good way
to get off the suspect list.

1:40:22.755 --> 1:40:24.235
Stab Gale Weathers,

1:40:24.409 --> 1:40:27.151
stab Mindy on the train.
That sort of thing.

1:40:27.325 --> 1:40:29.414
Yep, and I just made sure
I was first on the scene

1:40:29.588 --> 1:40:32.069
so I could switch her body out
with a fresh one.

1:40:32.243 --> 1:40:34.419
Little fake blood, a prosthetic.

1:40:34.593 --> 1:40:37.379
You'd be amazed at what
a grieving father
can get away with.

1:40:37.553 --> 1:40:39.859
I got Stu Macher's mask.

1:40:40.556 --> 1:40:41.644
He was my favorite.

1:40:44.690 --> 1:40:46.257
Nice. That's number three.

1:40:46.866 --> 1:40:47.998
That's two.

1:40:48.912 --> 1:40:49.956
Which leaves...

1:40:51.262 --> 1:40:52.611
your father's.

1:40:54.874 --> 1:40:57.268
This is what we've
been counting down to, Sam.

1:41:00.445 --> 1:41:02.404
I'm gonna need you to put it on.

1:41:04.623 --> 1:41:05.624
Fuck you!

1:41:06.712 --> 1:41:08.932
Ooh!

1:41:09.106 --> 1:41:10.586
Stay the fuck away from her!

1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:14.111
Come on.
- What? What is this?

1:41:14.285 --> 1:41:15.547
You did this as a family?

1:41:15.721 --> 1:41:16.809
Hell yeah, bitch!

1:41:16.983 --> 1:41:18.159
You should know
better than anyone.

1:41:18.333 --> 1:41:19.682
They're still not getting it.

1:41:19.856 --> 1:41:21.684
I don't know
what you believe,

1:41:21.858 --> 1:41:24.817
but I didn't commit
those murders in Woodsboro.
It wasn't me!

1:41:24.991 --> 1:41:26.602
We know that.
Of course you didn't.

1:41:26.776 --> 1:41:30.040
You think this is based on
some bullshit conspiracy theory?

1:41:30.214 --> 1:41:34.436
Come on. Who do you think
started the rumors about you
in the first place?

1:41:36.177 --> 1:41:38.309
Do you know how easy it was

1:41:38.483 --> 1:41:42.313
to turn Sam
from the hero of Woodsboro
into the villain?

1:41:42.487 --> 1:41:45.490
How easy it is
to convince the world

1:41:45.664 --> 1:41:49.668
to believe the worst in people
rather than the best?

1:41:49.842 --> 1:41:53.063
Because it's not enough
to just kill someone these days.

1:41:53.237 --> 1:41:56.240
You have to assassinate
their character first.

1:41:56.414 --> 1:41:59.983
So when Dad here "discovers"
your horribly mutilated bodies...

1:42:01.637 --> 1:42:03.987
...posed with Sam
wearing her father's mask,

1:42:04.161 --> 1:42:07.556
he'll say some poor dumb bastard
read on the Internet
that you're the real Ghostface

1:42:07.730 --> 1:42:10.211
and took matters
into their own deluded hands.

1:42:10.385 --> 1:42:13.214
Exactly! That's why
it's the perfect alibi.

1:42:13.388 --> 1:42:16.434
And all the best lies
are based on the truth.

1:42:18.001 --> 1:42:19.133
And you're a killer.

1:42:19.307 --> 1:42:20.917
- Just like your father.
- No, I'm not!

1:42:21.091 --> 1:42:24.573
Yes, you are, you motherfucker!
You killed our brother!

1:42:26.488 --> 1:42:27.750
What are you talking about?

1:42:27.924 --> 1:42:29.230
You said your brother died
in a car accident.

1:42:29.404 --> 1:42:31.232
No, no, no,
you sweet, dumb thing.

1:42:31.406 --> 1:42:33.321
He died in Woodsboro

1:42:34.409 --> 1:42:36.454
at the hands
of your bitch sister.

1:42:47.204 --> 1:42:48.379
You're Richie's family.

1:42:52.209 --> 1:42:53.254
Yeah.

1:42:54.646 --> 1:42:57.432
Ding-ding-ding-ding!
She's finally starting
to get it.

1:42:57.606 --> 1:42:59.912
Now! It wasn't
until I saw that photograph

1:43:00.086 --> 1:43:03.351
of what you'd actually done
to him that I knew.

1:43:03.525 --> 1:43:05.614
That I knew you had to fucking
die! You had to be punished!

1:43:05.788 --> 1:43:08.617
Along with anyone else
who stands in our way.

1:43:11.663 --> 1:43:13.187
There she is.

1:43:14.710 --> 1:43:16.407
There's the fucking killer.

1:43:16.581 --> 1:43:17.930
Great parenting job,
by the way.

1:43:18.104 --> 1:43:20.150
Shut your whore
fucking mouth!

1:43:21.238 --> 1:43:23.197
Shit.[Sam] You okay?

1:43:23.371 --> 1:43:25.895
Have I been a perfect Dad? No.

1:43:26.069 --> 1:43:28.985
Have I maybe overindulged
Richie's love
of these little movies?

1:43:29.159 --> 1:43:31.292
Yeah, maybe.

1:43:32.423 --> 1:43:33.859
For me,
they're just a little dark.

1:43:34.643 --> 1:43:35.644
But...

1:43:37.776 --> 1:43:39.038
Richie really loved them.

1:43:40.039 --> 1:43:41.215
He loved them!

1:43:42.216 --> 1:43:43.869
He even made a few of his own.

1:43:45.131 --> 1:43:46.742
Did you know? Did you know?

1:43:48.744 --> 1:43:51.137
<i>So you think I didn't post
a holiday special.</i>

1:43:51.312 --> 1:43:54.576
<i>Well, I tried to.
I really did try.</i>

1:43:55.620 --> 1:43:57.448
<i>That I could interact with.</i>

1:43:57.622 --> 1:44:00.364
There's a very special bond
between a father

1:44:00.538 --> 1:44:02.148
and his first son.

1:44:06.414 --> 1:44:08.154
Which is why I helped him
build this collection.

1:44:09.765 --> 1:44:11.941
This was all his?

1:44:12.115 --> 1:44:14.073
Yes, he's
a very passionate collector.

1:44:14.248 --> 1:44:15.553
And he inspired others.

1:44:15.727 --> 1:44:18.034
We had to kill those two
wannabe film students

1:44:18.208 --> 1:44:22.168
because, well,
we had to kill you first, Sam.

1:44:22.343 --> 1:44:26.390
I put the theater in their name,
then good old Detective Bailey
would've just stumbled on it,

1:44:26.564 --> 1:44:28.610
but I didn't have to because,
by golly,

1:44:28.784 --> 1:44:31.787
that Gale Weathers
is one hell of a journalist.

1:44:31.961 --> 1:44:33.832
I built a tribute
to my son.

1:44:35.138 --> 1:44:37.749
Which is why this is
where you have to die, Sam,

1:44:39.098 --> 1:44:41.666
surrounded by all the things
he loved the most.

1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:43.146
What happens next?

1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:45.191
After you're done with us
you just disappear?

1:44:45.366 --> 1:44:47.411
No! We got to hurry
over to the hospital

1:44:47.585 --> 1:44:50.762
and make sure Mindy
and Gale don't pull through.
Because everybody dies, Sam!

1:44:50.936 --> 1:44:54.636
Everyone who had anything to do
with the death of my son
suffers and dies.

1:44:54.810 --> 1:44:55.854
- Fuck yeah, they do!
- Yeah!

1:44:56.028 --> 1:44:57.943
Now put on the mask.

1:44:59.902 --> 1:45:03.384
He was...
...so pathetic.

1:45:05.734 --> 1:45:07.605
- That's not true.
- Yeah, your son,

1:45:08.911 --> 1:45:10.565
he was a man-baby

1:45:10.739 --> 1:45:13.307
who made his girlfriend
do all the killing.

1:45:13.481 --> 1:45:16.092
He was a strong,
virile young man!

1:45:16.266 --> 1:45:17.920
He was a limp-dick
little fuck

1:45:18.094 --> 1:45:19.835
who cried
before I slit his throat.

1:45:20.009 --> 1:45:22.881
Shut the fuck up!

1:45:26.407 --> 1:45:28.322
Sam, come on!

1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:32.238
Recognize this?

1:45:32.413 --> 1:45:33.631
Fuck you!

1:45:38.288 --> 1:45:39.855
Sorry,
but I kind of need this.

1:45:42.988 --> 1:45:44.599
Fuck 'em up.

1:45:44.773 --> 1:45:46.165
What are you gonna
do about it, bitch?

1:45:46.340 --> 1:45:47.645
Ow! Fuck!

1:45:51.345 --> 1:45:52.607
Sam!

1:45:58.743 --> 1:45:59.788
I'll get help.

1:46:15.151 --> 1:46:16.544
Be careful.

1:46:18.328 --> 1:46:20.112
Come on.

1:46:26.858 --> 1:46:28.643
Go get her.
Get her!

1:46:28.817 --> 1:46:30.775
I can't grab you.[Sam] It's okay.

1:46:30.949 --> 1:46:33.952
I can't grab on.
I can't grab on.

1:46:35.127 --> 1:46:36.128
No!

1:46:37.042 --> 1:46:38.479
No!

1:46:38.653 --> 1:46:40.568
I've always wanted
to stick something in you, Tara.

1:46:40.742 --> 1:46:42.396
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1:46:49.403 --> 1:46:52.101
You guys are so fucked now!

1:46:54.103 --> 1:46:55.365
Sam.

1:46:58.150 --> 1:46:58.977
Sam?

1:46:59.151 --> 1:47:00.892
- Let me go.
- No!

1:47:01.066 --> 1:47:03.199
Yeah, let her go, Sam,
come on.

1:47:03.939 --> 1:47:06.115
Fuck!

1:47:06.289 --> 1:47:07.682
Trust me.[Ethan] Fuck!

1:47:15.994 --> 1:47:17.343
You have to let me go.

1:47:28.442 --> 1:47:29.268
Gotcha!

1:47:49.550 --> 1:47:51.203
Now die a fucking virgin.

1:47:59.647 --> 1:48:01.605
Looks like you're down
another brother.

1:48:11.441 --> 1:48:13.138
Always got to
shoot them in the head.

1:48:20.189 --> 1:48:21.146
Oh, fuck.

1:48:45.519 --> 1:48:47.912
<i>Do you see
your boyfriend anywhere?</i>

1:48:48.086 --> 1:48:50.480
<i>I don't even have
a boyfriend right now.</i>

1:48:52.003 --> 1:48:53.614
<i>Would you like one?</i>

1:48:53.788 --> 1:48:56.573
<i>I don't even know you
and I dislike you already.</i>

1:49:07.323 --> 1:49:09.194
<i>Hello, Detective Bailey.</i>

1:49:09.368 --> 1:49:11.370
<i>I've got one question for you.</i>

1:49:12.110 --> 1:49:13.111
Oh, yeah?

1:49:14.112 --> 1:49:15.200
What's that?

1:49:16.506 --> 1:49:18.900
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

1:49:19.074 --> 1:49:23.252
"Favorite scary movie."

1:49:23.426 --> 1:49:26.211
<i>I'm asking
because you're in one now.</i>

1:49:27.082 --> 1:49:28.866
<i>You're in my movie.</i>

1:49:35.177 --> 1:49:36.395
Oh.

1:49:36.570 --> 1:49:39.007
I see you've
put on your true face, huh?

1:49:40.356 --> 1:49:41.662
Your birthright.

1:49:43.185 --> 1:49:45.317
Poetic that you're
gonna die in it.

1:49:45.491 --> 1:49:47.668
<i>This is what you wanted,
isn't it?</i>

1:49:51.846 --> 1:49:54.979
Now you know the truth, huh?
Murder's in your blood!

1:49:58.113 --> 1:49:59.810
Stop fucking around
and show yourself!

1:49:59.984 --> 1:50:02.552
<i>Be careful what you wish for.</i>

1:50:03.771 --> 1:50:05.773
All right,
I'm a fucking police officer.

1:50:05.947 --> 1:50:07.470
How do you think
this is gonna go, Sam?

1:50:07.644 --> 1:50:09.515
Who do you think
they're gonna believe, huh?

1:50:11.909 --> 1:50:14.346

1:50:22.616 --> 1:50:23.617
No! No!

1:50:52.036 --> 1:50:54.778
My father was a murderer.

1:50:57.215 --> 1:50:59.130
No matter
what you think,

1:50:59.957 --> 1:51:01.742
I'm better than that.

1:51:04.353 --> 1:51:05.484
Thank you.

1:51:07.051 --> 1:51:08.139
Thank you.

1:51:14.493 --> 1:51:16.452
But you did
fuck with our family, so...

1:51:31.772 --> 1:51:33.774
- Nice.
- Thanks.

1:51:35.558 --> 1:51:37.516
You okay?

1:51:42.086 --> 1:51:43.000
No.

but only as much
as you want me to be.

1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:41.493
I want you to be.

1:52:41.667 --> 1:52:44.279
I promise you I'm gonna get
so much therapy after this.

1:52:44.453 --> 1:52:46.063

1:53:14.439 --> 1:53:16.659
I saw that

1:53:21.882 --> 1:53:23.144
Sam. Hey.

1:53:23.318 --> 1:53:25.624
Two over there.
Let's go.

1:53:34.677 --> 1:53:35.939
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:53:37.462 --> 1:53:39.595
I thought you might need
some reinforcements.

1:53:39.769 --> 1:53:41.466
And I called Mount Sinai,

1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:43.077
and Mindy and Gale
are gonna be okay.

1:53:43.251 --> 1:53:45.906
Mindy's on her way here now.
They couldn't stop her.

1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:47.995
Not bad, Cute Boy.

1:53:48.169 --> 1:53:49.170
Thanks.

1:54:00.746 --> 1:54:03.227
If you ever need me, call.

1:54:03.401 --> 1:54:06.578
We're all part of
the same fucked-up family now.

1:54:06.752 --> 1:54:10.147
And legacy doesn't always have
to be a bad thing.

1:54:11.192 --> 1:54:12.193
Okay.

1:54:15.805 --> 1:54:16.850
Hey.

1:54:19.635 --> 1:54:20.854
It's just Chad.

1:54:24.292 --> 1:54:26.207
Hey, we got another one here!

1:54:27.599 --> 1:54:29.079
Watch out, coming through.

1:54:31.299 --> 1:54:33.779
Oh, my God.
- Chad! Chad!

1:54:33.954 --> 1:54:35.259
How are you alive?

1:54:38.959 --> 1:54:40.961
Core Fucking Four.

1:54:44.181 --> 1:54:45.400
Mmm. Mmm.

1:54:45.574 --> 1:54:47.968
Sorry. You probably need that.

1:54:48.142 --> 1:54:49.752
Oh, my God!
Are you guys okay?

1:54:49.926 --> 1:54:52.711
I know who the killer is!
It's Ethan and Bailey.

1:54:52.886 --> 1:54:55.758
- And Quinn.
- And Quinn? Fuck!

1:54:55.932 --> 1:54:57.194
Did I miss the monologue again?

1:54:57.368 --> 1:54:59.196
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

1:54:59.370 --> 1:55:01.068
You don't look okay.

1:55:01.242 --> 1:55:04.071
Oh, my God, we all survived.
It's a twist on a twist.

1:55:04.245 --> 1:55:06.029
They gave me a lot of drugs.

1:55:06.203 --> 1:55:07.901
You guys should
get some of these drugs.

1:55:08.075 --> 1:55:09.903
I can't feel anything
below my shoulders.
