00:06.417 --> 00:08.625
Looks like we're all ready to embark.

00:08.625 --> 00:11.458
Yep. The provisions
are all taken care of.

00:13.041 --> 00:16.000
Where's the captain of this ship?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.458
Yeah, where's the captain?

00:17.458 --> 00:20.375
This awesome boat ride
isn't going to enjoy itself.

00:20.375 --> 00:22.000
Mickey!

00:22.500 --> 00:23.667
Uh, be right there!

00:28.500 --> 00:30.667
Hey, you're not allowed in here.

00:32.709 --> 00:33.667
Gotcha!

00:41.000 --> 00:42.250
Hey!

00:43.000 --> 00:44.667
There he is!

00:44.667 --> 00:46.417
What took you so long?

00:46.417 --> 00:49.750
Hop aboard, Mick. I just
finished priming the poop deck.

00:49.750 --> 00:50.917
No! Wait!

00:52.709 --> 00:53.750
Hey!

00:53.750 --> 00:55.709
Hey! Hey, guys! Guys!

00:55.709 --> 00:57.583
Look! It's a monkey!

00:57.583 --> 00:58.667
Hey! It's me!

00:58.667 --> 01:00.083
Hey! Hey, guys!

01:00.083 --> 01:03.792
You ever get the feeling they're
trying to communicate with us?

01:08.458 --> 01:12.041
Wow! Mickey knew
exactly what it was saying.

01:12.041 --> 01:14.959
That's my Mickey!
He's so smart.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.333
Bravo!
Guys!

01:18.667 --> 01:19.959
Wait!

01:25.333 --> 01:26.750
It's that monkey again!

01:26.750 --> 01:29.458
He's taking a nap in his hammock.

01:30.750 --> 01:34.458
You're right, Mickey. He
does look kind of cute up there.

01:34.458 --> 01:35.542
Wait!

02:05.750 --> 02:08.667
Now that monkey's
performing some kind of dance.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.709
Must be mating season.

02:10.709 --> 02:13.291
Speaking of mating season...

02:18.333 --> 02:19.750
Wow.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.625
He's a scholar and a gentleman.

02:23.542 --> 02:24.667
Bravo!

02:24.667 --> 02:28.041
Oh, Mickey, you're so considerate.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.041
Ow!

02:41.625 --> 02:43.709
Ahh!
It's that monkey again!

02:43.709 --> 02:46.375
And he's enraged!

02:47.542 --> 02:48.834
You!

02:48.834 --> 02:50.792
Me?
No. Him.

02:51.625 --> 02:52.667
Mickey, look out!

02:52.667 --> 02:53.709
We'll save you, Mick!

02:53.709 --> 02:54.709
Oh!

03:01.750 --> 03:04.375
Mickey! Mickey!
Are you okay?

03:04.375 --> 03:05.458
Guys, guys, I'm fine.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.750
Let's just relax and
enjoy the rest of the ride.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.417
I hear there's some
gorgeous waterfalls up ahead.

03:11.417 --> 03:12.750
Waterfalls?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.458
Up ahead?

03:20.375 --> 03:24.375
Ha! What a boat ride this is
turning out to be. Right, gang?

03:24.375 --> 03:26.625
You said it, Mickey!

03:26.625 --> 03:27.750
Uh-huh.
