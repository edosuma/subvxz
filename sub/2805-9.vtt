PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar…

00:03.045 --> 00:04.838
Peter, you have the right
to remain silent.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.007
Curtis Hagen. What's your offer?

00:07.090 --> 00:09.593
I know how to make Peter Burke
a free man.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.929
<i>Coins. Minted from Welsh gold.</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:15.015
I can make
a believable facsimile of James's voice.

RECORDING: <i>I shot and killed</i>
<i>Senator Terrance Pratt</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:19.102
<i>using Peter Burke's gun.</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:20.479
With this evidence in hand,

00:20.562 --> 00:23.106
I see no other option
than to drop all charges.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.275
Mr. Burke, you are free to go.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.820
I think the gold was used to bribe
the federal prosecutor on Peter's case.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.155
You figured out what I want yet?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.699
-NEAL: <i>The Mosconi Codex.</i>
-You're gonna steal it for me.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.118
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.871
I know that the Codex leads to the window.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.290
Isn't it lucky you were already
planning to steal it for me?

00:40.457 --> 00:41.917
But there's something
you should know about me.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.502
I'm not an FBI agent.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.295
I'm a Criminal Informant.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.106
Morning.

01:04.898 --> 01:05.899
Morning.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.360
-Again.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:16.034 --> 01:18.161
Ahh, there you are.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.876
Don't worry, they delete
the audio every 24 hours.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.712
Audio? I thought you said
it was only a tracking…

01:26.795 --> 01:27.921
(LAUGHS)

01:28.547 --> 01:29.631
Ohh…

01:29.715 --> 01:31.800
-You are gonna pay for that.
-Oh, yeah?

01:31.884 --> 01:33.594
You pick up some moves
in that Moroccan jail?

01:33.677 --> 01:34.720
Maybe.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.972
I would love to go back,

01:37.055 --> 01:40.225
but the world's too big to go back
to the same place twice, don't you think?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.518
Hmm.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.855
The world used to be my oyster.

01:45.731 --> 01:49.318
Now, I know every oyster bar
in my two-mile radius.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.695
Two miles.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.407
That means you can never
come to my place.

(SIGHS)

01:59.494 --> 02:00.662
Look…

02:02.080 --> 02:03.415
My life is complicated.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.209
Is that too much for you?

02:06.919 --> 02:08.003
No.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.841
I didn't like you
because you were an FBI agent.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.009
-No?
-No.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.471
I liked you because you were smart

02:18.555 --> 02:20.349
and marginally easy on the eyes.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.976
And then, there was the Codex.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.105
Speaking of, can I ask you something?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.984
Mmm…

02:33.570 --> 02:37.282
You wanna know why
I'm investigating Chapter 13.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.701
Well, if it's not for the Bureau…

02:41.286 --> 02:43.997
When you're a criminal,
you get to know other criminals.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.667
My friend was in a lot of trouble,

02:47.292 --> 02:49.795
and the only person who could help him
was a really bad guy,

02:49.878 --> 02:51.547
and the payment was Chapter 13.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.967
So I stole it.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.552
And you made a copy.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.512
To find out why he wanted it.

02:59.763 --> 03:03.100
That was the right answer
because that means

03:03.183 --> 03:04.726
that this can still be undone.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.020
I mean, do you think
the original pages are safe?

03:07.563 --> 03:08.564
Yeah, I'm sure.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.608
So it's possible
that they could be returned?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.111
I mean, after we figure out

03:14.194 --> 03:16.697
why Mosconi wrote
the Chapter 13 in the first place

03:16.780 --> 03:19.241
and what the stained glass window
has to do with all of it.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.035
Rebecca,

03:24.246 --> 03:28.834
I think it's best if we distance you
from all of this.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.210
Oh…

03:30.669 --> 03:31.712
Why?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.755
The guy I gave that chapter to

03:34.298 --> 03:35.799
is not someone you wanna know.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.677
-Trust me.
-Right.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.722
Of course, of course. I trust you.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.125

what might have transpired last evening

04:10.209 --> 04:12.211
to require a drink tray.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.545
Oh?

04:13.629 --> 04:15.047
You showed her your anklet.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.383
And then you showed her
your anklet again.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.552
That's not a euphemism.
You're wearing a robe.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.137
I told Rebecca everything.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.307
Abridged. Nothing about you
and very little about Hagen.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.684
What about stealing the… Macchiato?

04:29.019 --> 04:31.480
Thanks, Agent Gruetzner.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.023
Never caught your first name.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.567
-Mozzie, short for "Mozart."
-Hmm.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.903
No further questions.
That's all you'll ever know.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.697
I can't believe I thought
you worked for the FBI.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.241
Apology accepted.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.160
-You look nice, by the way.
<i>-Merci.</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:47.663

04:51.250 --> 04:53.001
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.878

-Things.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.180
-Morning.
-Morning, Jones.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.391
I just came back from a pawn shop.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.060
Finally decided to unload
your action figure collection?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.479
Never. We got a call from the owner.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.274
The watch list?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.155
I knew this day would come.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.993
I never thought this particular
day would come.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.870
What, that we'd be outside
a bastion of the Masons,

05:27.953 --> 05:31.623
planning to heist a very old, highly
fragile 200-pound stained glass window?

05:31.707 --> 05:34.001
Well, give or take,
depending on the lead content.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.545
Crafted by Mosconi in 1887.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.547
-Yeah, right before he died.
-Or was killed.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.341
It's a big job for two people.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.385
Are you implying that we may need help?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.220
No, I'm just saying we have backup,
if we need her.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.140
As devoted as rare books Becca is
to our cause,

05:48.223 --> 05:49.808
we don't have time for third wheels or…

05:49.892 --> 05:51.268
Training wheels. I know.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.354
Once we figure out what Hagen
wants with it, we can loop her back in.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.608
Is it possible he's making us dance
just for his amusement?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.651
Mmm. He's not easily amused.

06:00.152 --> 06:03.530
Let's focus more on the how
before we get bogged down on the why.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.756
I'll keep an eye on the place.

When they set up the scaffolding
to reach the window…

06:23.383 --> 06:25.093
-We'll make our move.
-Good.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.978
Look what turned up today.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.607
Peter,

06:40.192 --> 06:41.693
this is a Welsh gold coin.

06:41.777 --> 06:42.819
Yep.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.739
I think it's one of the ones stolen
through that travel agency.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.990
Yeah, I'd put money on it.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.868
-Where'd it come from?
-A pawn shop.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.245
Someone came in to sell it.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.081
-Did the owner give you a name?
-Patience.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.416
Something tells me that's not a name.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.628
It always pays off
because the criminal always messes up.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.588
It always comes around to bite them.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.257
Must be our lucky day.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.758
Luck had nothing to do with it.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.344
I put those coins on an FBI watch list.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.138
This was my first case after prison,

07:10.222 --> 07:11.974
my last case as a field agent.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.518
-I remember.
-And now we have a lead.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.883
broke through the wall to access the vault

07:45.966 --> 07:47.092
and steal the coins.

07:47.301 --> 07:51.555
This is our shot to recover
1.8 million in rare gold.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.849
And we're operating under the assumption

07:53.932 --> 07:56.268
that this is part of a larger batch
that went missing.

I think our thief was testing the waters.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.397

08:01.106 --> 08:03.984
I'd float one coin.
Wait to see what happens. It could be.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.111
Did the pawn shop owner get an ID?

08:06.612 --> 08:07.654
They did.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.157
Sister Minnie O'Malley.

-You look surprised.
-So does she.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.873

Oh, the sister's not the only one
with sticky fingers.

than second base at a Cubs game.

Set off the alarm,
but the owner of the shop

08:39.937 --> 08:42.814
didn't want to file a report
when NYPD got there.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.025

08:45.108 --> 08:48.779
Exactly. These three are known
for trafficking precious metals.

to reveal who brought in the coin.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.263
El told me about
your bat phone since day one.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.932
I should have known she'd choose you.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.017
Hmm.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.020
I have questions.

(RINGBACK TONE)

12:13.317 --> 12:15.652
Hey, it's Neal. Listen, I need Estelle.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.196
No, right now.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.616
I am under no obligation
to provide answers.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.535
In fact, as a citizen
of this great country,

12:23.619 --> 12:25.078
you actually work for me.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.122
Well, let's get the IRS on the phone,

12:27.206 --> 12:29.875
see how much you've chipped in
for my salary.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.836
I may have time to entertain
a query or two.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.380
Who do you know that fences
high-end metals?

12:35.464 --> 12:37.466
Platinum, gold, copper?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.219
I am neither informant nor rat.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.470
Oh.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.056
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:44.139 --> 12:45.474
Diana's doing well.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.935
So is little Theo.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.313
I'd hate to break up that maternal bliss

12:51.396 --> 12:53.649
and ask her about the Teddy Winters case.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.817
That would be unfortunate.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.654
You have a name?

12:59.363 --> 13:01.281
Dekker. In the Flower District.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.283
-He traffics metals?
-Sure.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.660
Let's go with that.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.287
His front is the one with the tulip sign.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.998
That's fresh.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.300
Karl Dekker.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.969
Runs a stall at the flower market.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.805
Flowers imported daily
from all over the world.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.265
-Trucks in and out.
-Yeah.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.767
If you're gonna deal in illegal goods,
it's a smart front.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.645
Adjusting exchange rates
means messy books.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.729
Good way to hide money.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.898
Never been busted for fencing,

13:34.982 --> 13:37.734
but was arrested for an arms trade
a few years back.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.946
Yeah, he served the minimum after
flipping on the buyer and the seller.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.699
Good, that means
if we apply the right pressure,

13:43.782 --> 13:45.492
he'll tell us who brought him the coin.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.411
Well, it looks like Caffrey came through.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.996
No. This was my intel.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.290
Well, maybe he'll walk in
with the exact same lead.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.209
Or maybe he won't.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.508
Imagine my surprise when fair Estelle
descended with your message.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.510
-Well, you're not answering your phones.
-(SHUSHES)

14:03.594 --> 14:06.138
The panic in your voice
is causing her feathers to ruffle.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.639
Her brain is the size of a raisin.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.683
<i>Au revoir, ma belle!</i>

14:09.850 --> 14:10.893
All right.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.353
Dawson moved one of the coins
we stole for Hagen,

14:13.437 --> 14:15.063
and it turned up on Peter's desk.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.024
Do you know a fence named Karl Dekker?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.067
Moz, come on. Peter is on our heels.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.485
No, we're on his.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.613
He crashed my lunch.
I put him on Dekker's trail.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.989
All right, then we need to get to him.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.783
If Peter gets to Dekker first
and Dekker points to Dawson…

14:26.867 --> 14:28.660
Dawson might admit to taking a bribe,

14:28.744 --> 14:30.287
but they can't connect it back to you.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.623
Yes, they can.
That's how I got Dekker's name.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.958
(SIGHS) And if he somehow crumples

14:35.042 --> 14:36.627
under the Suit's verbal waterboarding…

14:36.710 --> 14:38.420
Peter's indicted,
and I'll end up in prison.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.796
I had a falling out with Dekker.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.089
He got the Flower District.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.592
If he sees me, he'll chase after me
with his pruning shears.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.135
Okay, then I'll go in alone.
Which shop is it?

14:45.219 --> 14:47.930
The New Amsterdam Garden Center,
the one with the tulips.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.264
And that's what you told Peter?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.433
Well, even under duress,
I didn't tell him everything.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.559
It's the red one.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.907
What are you doin' here?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.284
What I told you.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.078
Running down a fence.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.829
Karl Dekker.

15:13.247 --> 15:14.414
That's our guy.

15:14.873 --> 15:15.874
This is our location.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.167
New Amsterdam Garden Center.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.669
The sign with the tulip.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.838
-Let's go.
-Peter…

15:21.630 --> 15:23.841
I really think it's best
if I approach Dekker alone.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.008
Nope.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.261
No, if there's a lead
on who fenced that coin,

15:27.344 --> 15:28.345
I want it firsthand.

15:28.887 --> 15:29.972
All right.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.984
-I'm gonna kill him.
-What?

15:42.401 --> 15:44.111
There are three signs with a tulip.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.072
Yellow, red, pink.

15:49.408 --> 15:50.909
Did your source tell you which color?

15:50.993 --> 15:52.160
Of course he didn't. Did yours?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.205
I say we start with red.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.166
Red it is.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.189
Hold on.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.732
What, you're reconsidering the red tulip?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.025
So what if I am?

16:23.108 --> 16:24.818
-Let's go check out the yellow ones.
-No.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.403
Okay, that leaves pink.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.654
I know what that leaves us with.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.371
A dozen long-stems, thorns clipped off.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.124
-This stays airtight.
-I make sure of that.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.001
-Hello?
-What the hell?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.253
-Who the hell…
-Get the hell out, now.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.130
The FBI is storming the gates.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.715
Feds. This a setup?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.091
I don't know. Is it?

16:48.884 --> 16:50.135
Look, why don't we split up?

16:50.385 --> 16:52.137
I'll take yellow. You can take pink.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.640
I'll take pink. You take yellow.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.266
-Red.
-We're back to red.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.434
-Yes.
-Okay.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.563
Gentlemen, we must move.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.941
Time usually marches.
But in this case, she sprints.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.527
I'm gonna crush your larynx
with a 12-gauge wire.,

17:06.610 --> 17:07.903
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that,

17:07.986 --> 17:10.405
and you are not leaving here
with a dozen long-stems.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.615
I'll give you a choice.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.575
Bleach and a body bag, or that backdoor.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.960
Hey, look, Viceroy tulips.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.503
You should buy some for Elizabeth.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.754
Mm-hmm.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.089
Maybe on the way out.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.466
Every time you show up,
you cost me money.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.762
Dekker, just put it down. Follow me.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.021
We interrupted a deal.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.232
AK-47. Serial's burned off.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.693
Ammo disguised as seeds.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.576
Wait a minute. I know those shoes.

17:55.659 --> 17:56.660
Hey!

17:59.079 --> 18:00.455
Those are Mozzie's shoes.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.727
How much did switching shoes
with that guy cost you?

18:21.810 --> 18:24.855
A Benjamin Franklin
and exposure to athlete's foot.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.064
At least they're comfortable.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.191
Yeah, well, Peter's not happy.

18:27.316 --> 18:30.027
And now I have carte blanche
to the Flower District.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.904
The universe has achieved equilibrium.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.530
The scaffolding is up?

18:33.614 --> 18:36.033
Yeah, Sanderson Glass
reports to the church at 7:00 a.m.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.411
My recon tells me
they get their caffeine fix at 9:00.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.997
Yeah, well, once we're up
in the scaffolding, we're exposed.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.874
Front and side exits are weak spots.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.001
-We won't have long.
-Well, we'll figure it out.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.211
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

18:54.092 --> 18:55.344
-Hi.
-Hey.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.262
Look, ever since I left this morning,

18:57.346 --> 18:59.473
I've been thinking about the window
and the Codex and us…

18:59.556 --> 19:00.557
Come on in.

19:01.892 --> 19:02.893
Oh.

19:03.477 --> 19:05.479
-Hey, Mozzie.
-Good evening.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.107
That… The sketch.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.400
It wasn't here earlier.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.152
-Did you just draw that?
-Of course it was.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.407
Oh…

19:19.201 --> 19:20.994
You guys have a plan for the window.

19:22.496 --> 19:23.497
We were working on it.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.877
I'm gonna go soak my feet in tea tree oil.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.046
You do that.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.381
(DOOR OPENS)

19:38.846 --> 19:40.889
-You were thinking?
-I… (LAUGHS)

19:40.973 --> 19:42.391
I was.

19:42.808 --> 19:43.934
I still am.

19:44.309 --> 19:48.146
I said I understood why you need
to go ahead on the Codex without me,

19:48.230 --> 19:49.398
but I actually don't.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.192
Believe me when I say
it's for your own good.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.486
That book brought us together.

19:54.945 --> 19:58.740
Things are getting exciting.
I want to be part of it.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.450
I want to be part
of this part of your life.

20:00.534 --> 20:03.370
Mozzie and I are stealing
the stained glass. It's a crime.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.247
You're not a criminal,

20:06.248 --> 20:07.583
and I don't want to turn you into one.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.169
The only reason I know that
is because I found the schematic.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.212
I was gonna share the window
with you once I had it.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.423
Neal, what was the point
of all that honesty last night

20:14.506 --> 20:17.176
if you're just gonna keep secrets from me?

20:19.303 --> 20:20.721
I wanted you to know who I am.

20:20.804 --> 20:24.474
And now, I want to protect you
from who I am.

20:26.310 --> 20:28.353
I don't need protecting.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.898
But I do want to know one thing.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.191
What?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.109
Now that you have what you want,

20:35.027 --> 20:38.447
the Chapter 13, some Mosconi insight,

20:38.906 --> 20:39.948
me…

20:46.246 --> 20:47.497
Never mind.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.042
I know the answer.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.251
You got everything you wanted.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.669
Come on. It's not like that.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.339
It feels like that.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.218
Look, it's gonna be dangerous in the dark

20:59.301 --> 21:02.930
for you and for the windows,
so just be careful.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.139
It won't be dark.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.684
-We're stealing it tomorrow morning.
-Really?

21:07.768 --> 21:09.520
While the repairmen
take their coffee break.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.939
<i>The Scream</i> was stolen
during the day, twice.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.441
<i>-Mona Lisa,</i> too.
-How long will that take?

21:14.525 --> 21:15.859
We haven't timed it out yet.

21:15.943 --> 21:17.986
But how do you know you'll be able
to pull it off before…

21:18.070 --> 21:20.322
Why do I feel like
these are leading questions?

21:20.906 --> 21:23.784
What if you let me help?

21:23.867 --> 21:25.869
-I told you I don't want you…
-Nothing illegal.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.579
I could be a lookout or a distraction,

21:27.663 --> 21:31.291
just so that you and Mozzie
have the window you need.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.168
To steal the window.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.712
-Admit it.
-(SIGHS)

21:35.796 --> 21:37.089
It would help.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.591
It would, actually.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.093
So?

21:46.014 --> 21:48.016
-You're in.
-(LAUGHS) Yeah.

21:59.236 --> 22:02.072
I came so close
to getting Dekker yesterday.

22:03.282 --> 22:04.283
Ah…

22:05.284 --> 22:07.744
We seized a flower shop full of guns,

22:08.579 --> 22:10.122
but not the man behind it all.

22:11.248 --> 22:12.249
I'm sorry, honey.

22:12.332 --> 22:16.211
It's probably payback for using
your wife's not-so-secret phone

22:16.295 --> 22:17.504
to track Mozzie.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.089
Mozzie, I get.

22:19.298 --> 22:22.885
It's Neal and those Welsh gold coins.

22:23.635 --> 22:24.928
You really think he stole them?

22:25.637 --> 22:28.098
It would explain why they
didn't want me to get to Dekker.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.894
I don't know, stealing the money
just to take it, and then selling it

22:31.977 --> 22:34.354
to a weapons-dealing fence
just doesn't seem like Neal.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.481
Well, a lot doesn't add up on this one.

22:37.191 --> 22:40.485
Two million missing from
the Summers investigation,

22:40.569 --> 22:43.989
and that FBI pen that I found
at the chiropractor's office,

22:44.072 --> 22:45.324
the one where Neal was.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.700
It's Dekker.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.577
He's the last straw.

22:49.912 --> 22:51.163
Hey, ASAC Burke.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.624
You know, the last time
you became suspicious,

22:53.707 --> 22:55.083
it ended up being about a woman.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.668
It's never just about a woman.

22:56.752 --> 22:59.087
A lovely woman,
the first one in a really long time

22:59.171 --> 23:00.422
that Neal's been interested in.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.553
-He's back.
-Where?

23:06.762 --> 23:08.764
16th and Rutherford.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.600
-Now you know where he is.
-Yeah.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.939
All right. The window's out.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.650
All we have to do is get in there,
lower it down…

23:19.733 --> 23:20.901
And roll away with it,

23:21.568 --> 23:24.112
avoiding the cameras on that stop light,

23:24.404 --> 23:26.740
that church and that garage.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.160
The city's becoming
a modern-day panopticon.

23:30.244 --> 23:32.871
Easy, Bentham.
That's a rant for another day.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.374
REBECCA: There go the repairmen
on their coffee break.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.378
Rebecca, are you sure about this?

23:39.503 --> 23:40.504
Yeah.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.506
These are my favorites.
Gotta sell it, right?

23:43.090 --> 23:44.925
-See you on the other side.
-See you.

23:45.259 --> 23:47.344
-You go, girl.
-What?

23:47.970 --> 23:49.596
I've always wanted to say that.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.314
No. No, no, no.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.234
Excuse me.

24:02.818 --> 24:03.986
Could you help me?

24:04.403 --> 24:06.321
My earring fell down the drain.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.408
(SUPPRESSING SOB)
It was my grandmother's.

24:09.741 --> 24:11.118
It's all that I have left of hers.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.995
Yeah, but… Forget it.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.079
No, you know what? It's fine.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.039
Go, go. I'm sure that I can lift this.

24:16.123 --> 24:18.625
-Come on.
-Listen. Step aside, baby girl.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.669
-I got this.
-Really?

24:24.882 --> 24:26.925
-In the crate.
-Clamp it shut.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.511
-Bungee cord.
-And we lower her down slowly.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.848
-MAN: You guys done in there yet?
-Whoa.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.224
Someone's headed our way.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.685
Right uniforms, wrong faces.

24:37.186 --> 24:38.937
-I'll occupy him.
-How?

24:39.021 --> 24:41.607
I'll ask him a question
that he'll be compelled to answer.

24:51.408 --> 24:52.910
I'm in need of a sanctuary.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.621
Look, try the Hare Krishnas
over in Boerum Hill.

24:55.704 --> 24:57.247
They'll give you lunch. Now, excuse me.

24:57.331 --> 24:58.790
I need to check on a window repair.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.251
Oh, how rude of me. Blaine Rockford.

25:04.379 --> 25:05.464
On the level.

25:05.714 --> 25:06.882
On the square.

25:07.299 --> 25:08.592
That handshake.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.719
You're of the 33rd Order.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.764
Who will help the widow's son?

25:14.056 --> 25:15.557
Come with me, brother.

25:16.475 --> 25:17.643
You are safe.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.712
So, Mr. Rockford, you are welcome
to wait here as long as you need.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.422
Oh, no, thanks. I'm quite recovered.

25:47.506 --> 25:50.133
Dehydration led to an acute bout
of paranoia.

25:52.052 --> 25:55.180
Is it possible for me to procure
some more of this holy swill?

25:55.264 --> 25:56.431
Well, it's not…

25:56.515 --> 25:58.600
The widow's son is parched.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.150
-(LAUGHS)
-Got it.

26:07.234 --> 26:08.277
Here you go.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.403
I guess picked the right guys
for the job.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.779
Mm-hmm.

26:10.863 --> 26:12.406
The least I can do
is buy you guys some coffee.

26:12.489 --> 26:15.075
-Uh, we gotta get back.
-Oh, really?

26:15.284 --> 26:17.578
Hey, uh, did you get that smile
from your grandma, too?

26:17.661 --> 26:20.122
(LAUGHS) Everybody says so.

26:20.539 --> 26:21.623
I bet.

26:23.792 --> 26:24.877
Here we go.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.141
Hey, let's get going.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.478
All right.

26:44.563 --> 26:45.898
Okay. Go.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.276
You got it?

27:07.503 --> 27:09.004
Dare I say we pulled it off?

27:09.421 --> 27:12.758
As long as you walk under a ladder
and step on a crack at the same time.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.177
I think maybe we pulled it off.

27:16.512 --> 27:17.638
What's goin' on?

27:18.931 --> 27:20.349
-It's gone.
-What is?

27:20.432 --> 27:21.934
The window. It's gone.

27:23.602 --> 27:25.187
Who'd steal a window from a church?

27:25.854 --> 27:27.231
I got a pretty good idea.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.867
PETER: When you were on a break,
you didn't see anybody?

27:38.951 --> 27:40.035
-No.
-Peter?

27:42.162 --> 27:43.288
I work with him.

27:43.497 --> 27:45.582
He works for me. Thanks, guys.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.459
What's goin' on?

27:47.835 --> 27:49.419
Somebody stole that window.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.755
-That's weird.
-Very.

27:53.090 --> 27:55.634
The church called the FBI
about a stolen window?

27:55.717 --> 27:56.844
No, they did not.

27:56.927 --> 27:58.178
No, I was in the area.

27:59.471 --> 28:00.848
You pulled my tracking.

28:00.931 --> 28:02.808
Puts you here on a regular basis.

28:04.518 --> 28:05.727
You caught me.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.149
What's that?

28:11.233 --> 28:14.611
Well, if a croissant and a donut
give each other a very special hug…

28:15.320 --> 28:16.572
You come here for food?

28:16.655 --> 28:17.990
It's more like a controlled substance.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.491
Yeah, the shop's right around the corner.

28:19.658 --> 28:21.660
Here, take it.
I'll go stand in line for another.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.328
-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-No, hold on.

28:24.162 --> 28:25.330
Yeah, Jones.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.959
That is interesting. I'm on my way.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.587
-What's interesting?
-Something Jones found.

28:31.837 --> 28:33.297
Well, I'll come with you.
I like interesting.

28:33.380 --> 28:36.633
Nah. Go buy yourself
another croissant-donut thingy.

28:41.138 --> 28:43.390
-The same corner we followed him to?
-Yeah.

28:43.599 --> 28:46.852
When I got there, someone had stolen
a stained glass window from a church.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.437
Stained glass window.

28:49.313 --> 28:50.939
I got nothin'. What did Caffrey say?

28:51.023 --> 28:52.441
He blamed it on the pastry,

28:53.108 --> 28:56.737
which I add to my Venn diagram
of loose ends along with the Welsh gold.

28:57.029 --> 28:58.947
Well, this place is
another kind of gold mine.

28:59.448 --> 29:02.159
It looks like Dekker was a middleman
for a major arms deal.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.746
Poppies equal pistols.
Ranunculus equal revolvers.

29:05.829 --> 29:07.456
Freesias equal .45s.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.959
And he left something else behind.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.256
Unmarked bills.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.674
(COINS JINGLING)

29:17.841 --> 29:19.510
And Krugerrands and antique silver.

29:19.843 --> 29:22.012
Hard to track, like Welsh coins.

29:24.389 --> 29:26.099
Leave everything here and clear out.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.769
Dekker ran away
without his emergency stash.

29:28.852 --> 29:30.354
Good chance he'll come back for it.

29:30.646 --> 29:32.606
I'll gear up for some
quality time in the van.

29:32.689 --> 29:33.774
If he does, we'll get him.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.484
Call me at 7:30 with an update.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.027
What if there's nothing to report?

29:37.110 --> 29:39.613
Call me anyway. 7:30 sharp.

29:40.155 --> 29:41.323
Saved you half.

29:56.797 --> 29:58.131
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

30:06.348 --> 30:07.558
Coming!

30:12.396 --> 30:13.522
Hey, Peter.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.275
Do you want to come in?

30:16.733 --> 30:17.943
I want answers.

30:20.529 --> 30:23.240
-You looking for something?
-Yeah. About two million in gold coins.

30:23.740 --> 30:24.741
(SCOFFS)

30:24.950 --> 30:26.076
You won't find 'em here.

30:26.577 --> 30:27.911
You're not that sloppy.

30:28.579 --> 30:29.830
You really think I took them.

30:29.913 --> 30:33.083
There was a moment when you were alone
upstairs in that firehouse.

30:34.126 --> 30:36.587
And why else wouldn't you want me
to go with you to talk to Dekker?

30:36.795 --> 30:39.590
I told you he would spook,
and look what happened.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.925
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

30:46.263 --> 30:47.973
Yeah, Jones. What do you have?

30:49.057 --> 30:50.309
7:30, like you said.

30:50.684 --> 30:51.852
<i>No sign of Dekker.</i>

30:51.935 --> 30:53.395
Great. Bring him in.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.439
-I want him to sweat.
<i>-No, Peter.</i>

30:55.522 --> 30:56.940
I said, "No sign of Dekker."

30:57.900 --> 30:59.776
I want him ready to sing when I get there.

31:02.070 --> 31:03.280
You got it.

31:05.824 --> 31:06.909
Dekker.

31:08.368 --> 31:10.287
-You got him?
-What'd I tell you?

31:10.579 --> 31:11.955
Criminals always mess up.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.959
Come on.
Time to find out who has those gold coins.

31:18.879 --> 31:19.963
Neal?

31:20.547 --> 31:21.673
Let's go.

31:23.175 --> 31:24.301
We can't.

31:26.053 --> 31:27.137
Because you stole them.

31:29.306 --> 31:31.266
-It's not what you think.
-Oh…

31:34.102 --> 31:36.230
Neal, you impersonated a fireman,

31:36.313 --> 31:38.649
and you robbed a vault under my watch.

31:38.732 --> 31:40.108
-I can explain, all right?
-Don't!

31:40.234 --> 31:43.237
Don't you dare try
to justify what you did!

31:43.695 --> 31:47.032
I put myself out on the line
for you, all the time!

31:47.199 --> 31:48.617
I helped your father.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.286
I was charged for murder because of it.

31:51.370 --> 31:52.621
I nearly lost everything…

31:52.704 --> 31:53.956
I did it for you!

31:54.915 --> 31:56.166
What are you talkin' about?

31:56.917 --> 31:59.419
To make sure Dawson would
authenticate the confession.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.716
My prosecutor?

32:06.051 --> 32:07.219
He took a bribe.

32:10.639 --> 32:12.266
You couldn't find James, could you?

32:13.892 --> 32:14.977
I tried.

32:15.686 --> 32:17.187
So you forged his voice,

32:17.271 --> 32:19.648
and I was cleared on false evidence.

32:19.731 --> 32:21.358
Look, even if you were found innocent,

32:21.441 --> 32:24.653
indictment would have ended
your career at the FBI because of me.

32:26.113 --> 32:27.531
Because of my father.

32:30.242 --> 32:31.702
I couldn't let that happen to you.

32:33.453 --> 32:35.664
Neal, do you realize what you have done?

32:35.747 --> 32:36.790
Yeah.

32:37.082 --> 32:38.709
I made sure justice was served.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.918
No.

32:40.169 --> 32:41.461
That's what I do.

I have to arrest you.

32:59.479 --> 33:00.814
I'll do the time,

33:02.232 --> 33:03.525
but you think about it, Peter,

33:04.193 --> 33:05.944
what this will do to your life,

33:07.487 --> 33:08.780
to Elizabeth.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.077
I did the right thing.

33:15.037 --> 33:16.413
None of this is right.

33:27.883 --> 33:31.178
Okay, so you just
left Neal at his apartment?

33:31.637 --> 33:33.013
He's not goin' anywhere.

33:34.056 --> 33:35.974
If I book him, this all goes on record.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.771
I just needed to talk
to you first because…

33:40.854 --> 33:42.231
Because what?

33:43.774 --> 33:45.359
Because there's no way out of this.

33:45.692 --> 33:46.693
Well, there has to be.

33:46.944 --> 33:49.446
Honey, Neal committed a crime.

33:50.030 --> 33:52.699
Dawson accepted a bribe,
and I know about it.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.577
I don't even deserve the badge
to arrest them.

33:56.453 --> 33:57.871
I've been promoted.

Whoa, whoa, wait.
All of this is real.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.921
I mean, all of this is deserved.

34:07.172 --> 34:09.842
Honey, you turned them in.

34:10.175 --> 34:11.593
Your case is gonna be reopened.

34:11.885 --> 34:16.014
I'll be indicted, there will be a murder
trial, and I'll lose my job.

34:16.098 --> 34:18.433
No, that's not justice. You're innocent.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.561
Why should we lose everything?

(SIGHS)

34:24.731 --> 34:26.066
Oh, this is all my fault.

34:27.776 --> 34:30.070
I asked Neal to do whatever he could
to help you.

34:30.529 --> 34:32.573
Honey, Neal broke the law. You didn't.

34:32.656 --> 34:33.824
I'm glad he did.

34:36.535 --> 34:37.953
I can't condone this.

34:39.538 --> 34:42.457
I believe in the system. Always have.

34:44.376 --> 34:46.795
What does it say about me
if I let this go?

34:48.589 --> 34:53.635
It says that you're a man
who stays and fixes what's broken.

34:54.511 --> 34:58.140
It says you're a man who understands
the letter of the law is subjective.

35:00.726 --> 35:02.019
I'm sorry.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.230
I swore I'd never
put you through this again.

35:06.023 --> 35:08.692
Are you willing to give up
everything we've built?

35:10.485 --> 35:12.654
I need to be able to live with myself.

35:15.574 --> 35:16.825
Then do what you have to do,

35:17.659 --> 35:20.120
but just be damn sure
that you need to do it.

You were right.

36:02.246 --> 36:03.288

36:03.372 --> 36:05.207
He was not at all happy to see me.

36:05.415 --> 36:06.458
Well, I'm sure.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.919
Peter, I didn't ask him
about the Welsh gold yet.

36:11.713 --> 36:12.756
Why not?

36:12.840 --> 36:15.050
Well, 'cause he should get serious time
for the weapons charge.

36:15.133 --> 36:17.511
I mean, Dekker's cut deals before.
He'll try to plead down the guns…

36:17.594 --> 36:19.638
Yeah, we can keep the coins as leverage.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.098
All right.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.308
You want me to go in there with you?

36:23.934 --> 36:26.019
No. You made the bust. You take it.

36:26.645 --> 36:27.688
All right.

36:39.199 --> 36:40.701
You didn't have Dekker last night.

36:41.910 --> 36:43.412
No, but I knew we'd get him.

36:44.621 --> 36:45.956
Misinformation.

36:46.832 --> 36:49.585
It's an acceptable method
of extracting a confession.

36:50.919 --> 36:53.130
Sometimes the ends do justify the means.

37:00.137 --> 37:02.389
I'm gonna tell Dawson
that I know he took a bribe.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.099
-If you…
-I know what it means.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.769
You want me to go with you?

37:08.437 --> 37:09.438
(SIGHS)

37:11.815 --> 37:12.900
No.

37:20.866 --> 37:22.034
Mr. Dawson.

37:22.576 --> 37:24.995
Agent Burke. What brings you here?

37:25.078 --> 37:27.581
I'm investigating a federal prosecutor.

37:31.376 --> 37:34.922
He took a $1.8 million bribe
from my criminal informant.

37:37.633 --> 37:39.551
You can spare me the look of surprise.

37:41.637 --> 37:42.971
I don't like what you're insinuating.

37:43.055 --> 37:44.556
Then you're really not gonna like this.

37:44.932 --> 37:46.767
I have Karl Dekker in custody,

37:47.392 --> 37:49.686
the fence you used
to liquidate the Welsh gold.

37:50.062 --> 37:51.772
I hope you can substantiate this.

37:51.855 --> 37:53.899
I can. My CI talked.

37:54.608 --> 37:55.901
I know everything.

37:56.443 --> 37:57.986
Mutually-assured destruction.

37:58.695 --> 38:02.074
Turn in the coins
to the FBI anonymously and resign.

38:02.658 --> 38:03.742
And if I don't?

38:05.118 --> 38:09.206
Turn in the coins and resign,
or I arrest you right now.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.708
I hope you can live with that ultimatum.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.753
Either way.

38:17.631 --> 38:19.174
You think Peter will cuff Dawson?

38:19.258 --> 38:21.260
Well, he hasn't yet, or I'd be in a cell.

38:21.593 --> 38:24.346
Peter can't ever know that Hagen
was behind that bribe.

38:24.429 --> 38:26.640
Or that we're the reason
the Dutchman made his appeal.

38:26.723 --> 38:28.767
Or that there's evidence of me
stealing the coins.

38:29.810 --> 38:31.061
Yeah, we are running out of time.

38:31.144 --> 38:33.021
I have to hand over this window
to Hagen by…

38:33.105 --> 38:34.231
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

38:35.107 --> 38:36.108
Wow.

38:36.608 --> 38:38.735
That's kind of a crime unto itself.

38:39.361 --> 38:41.238
Did we really need to take it apart?

38:41.446 --> 38:43.824
Well, if we really want to find out
why this is so important,

38:43.949 --> 38:45.909
we have to open up our minds.

38:46.702 --> 38:49.997
-Actually, we still have some good…
-No more hallucinogens, Dr. Leary.

38:50.455 --> 38:51.790
Free association, then.

38:52.082 --> 38:53.166
Um…

38:53.250 --> 38:55.210
-Purple. Go.
-Okay. Color.

38:55.669 --> 38:58.046
Color in stained glass
comes from metallic salts.

38:58.130 --> 39:00.632
Copper oxide, cobalt, gold.

39:00.716 --> 39:01.842
Metal.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.719
Another word for stained glass
is "leadlight."

39:04.219 --> 39:06.263
Maybe the iron framework is a map.

39:07.055 --> 39:10.184
The concept of stained glass
was never to see the world outside.

39:10.267 --> 39:11.393
Or to admit light.

39:11.476 --> 39:14.771
It was to control it,
to use it to reveal something.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.106
But what?

39:16.273 --> 39:18.525
A question only
a Masonic-Italian expatriate

39:18.609 --> 39:22.321
mad genius trained in painting, metallurgy
and engineering can answer.

39:26.992 --> 39:28.076
One second.

39:28.285 --> 39:29.411
Look at this.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.414
That's Mosconi's signature.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.291
How did it get there?

39:34.374 --> 39:35.501
This blue pane.

39:35.584 --> 39:36.793
A decoder lens.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.545
Let me see.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.591
No, it only works on this one.

39:43.884 --> 39:46.261
Mosconi made this window
and hid his name in it,

39:46.345 --> 39:47.596
along with the decoder.

39:48.931 --> 39:50.224
It doesn't work on ours.

39:50.891 --> 39:52.017
Because it's a copy.

39:52.184 --> 39:53.477
That's why he needed…

39:54.603 --> 39:55.646
Uh-oh.

40:00.859 --> 40:03.487
Neal, you asked me to trust you.

40:04.613 --> 40:05.822
You can trust me.

40:07.658 --> 40:10.118
The man of questionable character
I told you about?

40:10.452 --> 40:11.912
His name is Curtis Hagen,

40:12.246 --> 40:14.206
and he's holding
incriminating evidence over me.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.583
A Damocles' sword, if you will.

40:17.292 --> 40:20.337
And now we know he needs this
to decode Chapter 13.

40:20.921 --> 40:22.339
We had to give him the original.

40:23.048 --> 40:25.008
But without that glass,
he'll never know the secret.

40:25.509 --> 40:27.928
-We can turn the tables.
-So what's the plan?

40:29.221 --> 40:31.223
Leverage the decoder
for the evidence tape.

40:31.849 --> 40:34.059
-Then you'll be free.
-Or not.

40:34.685 --> 40:35.936
Depends on Peter.

40:51.493 --> 40:53.245
-Yeah, Caffrey?
-You heard from Peter?

40:53.704 --> 40:54.955
Not since yesterday. Why?

40:55.330 --> 40:56.748
He's late. He's never late.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.208
Well, there must be a reason.

40:58.292 --> 40:59.334
(SIGHS)

40:59.418 --> 41:00.586
Must be.

41:07.593 --> 41:09.303
I got a tip on the Welsh gold.

41:09.386 --> 41:10.596
It checked out.

41:10.679 --> 41:12.055
Jones, put a team together.

41:13.265 --> 41:14.516
My office, now.

41:17.936 --> 41:20.606
Every time. I'm glad it's you, not me.

41:20.898 --> 41:22.149
Thanks.

41:33.368 --> 41:36.914
The coins are in a safety deposit box
at a bank downtown.

41:37.956 --> 41:41.627
Andrew Dawson no longer works
for the Department of Justice.

41:42.711 --> 41:43.837
What about you?

41:45.130 --> 41:46.256
I'm still here.

41:46.965 --> 41:48.550
Look, you arrested a dangerous fence,

41:48.634 --> 41:51.303
recovered the gold,
took down a dirty prosecutor.

41:52.304 --> 41:53.514
It's a win.

41:54.264 --> 41:55.724
It's a compromise,

41:56.350 --> 41:58.018
one I will never make again.

42:00.771 --> 42:02.564
I know why you did what you did.

42:02.898 --> 42:03.982
Yeah.

42:04.566 --> 42:05.984
To help my friend.

42:08.195 --> 42:09.947
And because you're a criminal,

42:11.490 --> 42:13.075
and you can't help yourself.

42:14.493 --> 42:17.120
Shame on me for expecting anything else.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.416
Things are gonna change

42:22.292 --> 42:23.627
for the both of us.

42:24.002 --> 42:25.379
Yeah.

42:31.635 --> 42:32.845
It's time they did.
