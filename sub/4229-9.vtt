WEBVTT

00:00.654 --> 00:01.694
They’re going to break us.

00:02.838 --> 00:04.027
We'll come back for her.

00:04.051 --> 00:05.926
Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:06.155 --> 00:07.304
She's paralyzed.

00:07.328 --> 00:08.870
Take my spikes.
Put them in Maggie.

00:13.001 --> 00:14.842
If your dad's under there,
we're gonna find him

00:16.318 --> 00:17.446
It's the crashed Beamer.

00:17.509 --> 00:18.632
Cochise must have nailed it.

00:19.022 --> 00:20.068
***

00:20.707 --> 00:22.427
I think we just pulled the pin
on a grenade.

00:23.960 --> 00:24.960
Matt?!

00:24.984 --> 00:25.984
I told you
he'd make it.

00:26.096 --> 00:27.146
What the hell is that?

00:27.904 --> 00:30.035
It's about
the moonlight.

00:34.130 --> 00:35.697
It cannot be that simple.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.366
You saw
these lights come on?

00:38.434 --> 00:41.403
Yeah, when these solar panels
were exposed to the moon,

00:41.437 --> 00:44.539
which I guess
makes them lunar panels.

00:44.573 --> 00:46.174
Hey, you remember
in the camp,

00:46.208 --> 00:48.043
when we figured out
that the laser wall

00:48.110 --> 00:49.577
was powered by the dirigible?
Right.

00:49.612 --> 00:51.446
I think the same principle
is at play here,

00:51.480 --> 00:53.615
except on
a much bigger scale.

00:53.649 --> 00:55.784
I think the Espheni
are powering all their tech

00:55.818 --> 00:57.652
off the same
power source.

00:57.687 --> 01:00.355
Moonlight?
No.

01:00.389 --> 01:02.657
A form of energy
beamed from the moon.

01:02.725 --> 01:04.825
Wireless
electricity.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.695
Tesla thought
it was possible.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.564
The Espheni must have
finally perfected it.

01:09.598 --> 01:12.267
And it suggests that
the Espheni power core,

01:12.301 --> 01:15.203
which our Volm recon teams
have found so difficult

01:15.237 --> 01:16.504
to locate here on earth,

01:16.539 --> 01:19.474
was never on earth
in the first place.

01:19.542 --> 01:24.679
It was just...
over our heads.

01:24.714 --> 01:27.582
<i>Ex coch'El richt!</i>
<i>Fush mach!</i>

01:27.616 --> 01:29.117
<i>Fush mach!</i>

01:29.151 --> 01:33.154
Hey, Cochise,
don't beat yourself up so badly.

01:34.557 --> 01:37.358
I need to be alone
for a moment.

01:39.195 --> 01:42.464
So, why do you think they built
the power source on the moon?

01:44.233 --> 01:46.835
The only reason you would beam
power from orbit is if --

01:46.869 --> 01:49.404
You wanted to have a vantage point
to power the entire planet.

01:49.438 --> 01:51.239
So,
the power core on the moon

01:51.273 --> 01:54.142
supports every laser wall
on every ghetto?

01:54.176 --> 01:55.844
All over the world.

01:55.911 --> 01:57.579
Everything else --
every skitter factory,

01:57.613 --> 02:00.415
every nightmare that
we haven't even imagined yet.

02:00.483 --> 02:05.186
It powers the entire Espheni
war machine.

02:05.254 --> 02:07.355
Well, then I don't see
that we have many options.

02:07.389 --> 02:09.691
We're gonna have to figure out
a way to get up there,

02:09.725 --> 02:11.226
blow that
son of a bitch up.

02:15.331 --> 02:16.498
It's on the moon.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.535
You heard that part, right?

02:20.603 --> 02:23.404
- Yes!

02:23.439 --> 02:25.607
And I know that look
you're giving me, Dan.

02:25.641 --> 02:27.442
And I know that smile.

02:27.476 --> 02:29.277
I've seen it when you've tried
to talk some crazy bastard

02:29.311 --> 02:30.879
from jumping off
of a ledge.

02:30.913 --> 02:33.248
Well, guess what.
Today the crazy bastard is me.

02:35.951 --> 02:39.454
All right. Let's, uh --
let's talk this thing through.

02:39.488 --> 02:42.590
Firstly,
how do we gain access to it?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.592
I don't know.
Okay.

02:44.627 --> 02:47.495
And I'm pretty sure
that if we do unearth it,

02:47.530 --> 02:49.164
it's gonna be a little beat-up.
I don't know.

02:49.198 --> 02:50.799
And, hey, if we find that "on"
switch, maybe we can...

02:50.833 --> 02:52.901
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

02:52.968 --> 02:54.602
Stop saying that!

02:54.637 --> 02:56.171
We choose to go to the moon

02:56.238 --> 02:58.506
not because it's easy
but because it's hard.

02:58.541 --> 02:59.941
Okay, so, this is funny?
This is funny to you?

02:59.975 --> 03:01.776
Hang on.
Let me finish the speech.

03:01.811 --> 03:03.478
Because, believe it or not,
the first time

03:03.546 --> 03:05.380
that I heard that speech,
I was crazy enough to think

03:05.414 --> 03:07.682
that JFK
was actually talking to me.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.718
'Cause that is a challenge
that we are willing to accept --

03:10.753 --> 03:13.254
one that we are
unwilling to postpone

03:13.289 --> 03:14.756
and one which we intend to win.

03:14.790 --> 03:18.827
Okay, Tom,
we cannot fly to the moon.

03:18.861 --> 03:21.729
W-well,
we wouldn't necessarily

03:21.764 --> 03:23.565
have to fly to the moon.

03:23.599 --> 03:25.300
Cochise?

03:27.736 --> 03:30.839
Just play it a little
hypothetical with me.

03:30.873 --> 03:32.674
If the power core
is on the moon,

03:32.708 --> 03:35.243
wouldn't it follow the Espheni
have some kind of base up there?

03:35.277 --> 03:37.812
In all likelihood,
yes.

03:37.847 --> 03:42.350
Okay, well, since we know that
Beamers are controlled remotely,

03:42.384 --> 03:43.651
if we can
figure out a way

03:43.686 --> 03:45.854
to set the moon base
as a destination,

03:45.888 --> 03:48.756
wouldn't all we need to do
is hitch a ride?

03:48.791 --> 03:51.726
I cannot believe
I am saying this,

03:51.760 --> 03:53.995
but it is not as crazy
as it sounds.

03:54.029 --> 03:57.532
You're right.
It's crazier.

03:57.566 --> 04:00.835
I honestly don't see
any other alternative.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.604
I mean, think about it.

04:02.638 --> 04:04.906
You...Close down a skitter
factory, liberate a camp.

04:04.974 --> 04:06.808
What then --
we move on to the next one

04:06.842 --> 04:08.743
and we save the world
one bloodbath at a time?!

04:08.811 --> 04:09.844
I don't think so!

04:11.113 --> 04:14.582
We got to shut them all down
at the same time, at the source.

04:14.650 --> 04:15.817
That's the only way.

04:15.851 --> 04:20.889
Well...
We do have a Beamer.

04:20.923 --> 04:23.825
A buried Beamer.

04:23.859 --> 04:26.719
So, let's unbury it.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.720

04:39.222 --> 04:41.390
Ah, nothing like working all day
and barely making a dent.

04:41.424 --> 04:43.092
The Espheni blew up
the whole town.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.060
It's gonna take some time
to clean it up.

04:45.095 --> 04:47.062
Hey.

04:47.097 --> 04:48.464
How you feeling?

04:48.498 --> 04:51.133
Like I just went 10 rounds
with Mike Tyson

04:51.201 --> 04:54.169
and he was using
brass knuckles and knives

04:54.204 --> 04:56.005
and a steamroller.

04:56.039 --> 04:59.008
At least he didn't
bite your ear off.

04:59.075 --> 05:00.543
What are you doing up?
You ought to be resting.

05:00.577 --> 05:02.244
You just had an alien-spike
transplant.

05:02.279 --> 05:04.246
Yeah, and now
I've got alien DNA

05:04.281 --> 05:07.383
coursing through my veins
and my muscles.

05:07.417 --> 05:08.951
It hurts.

05:08.985 --> 05:10.953
I can't concentrate.
I can't sit still.

05:10.987 --> 05:12.621
I got to do something.

05:15.025 --> 05:16.659
Want to move some rubble?

05:16.693 --> 05:20.496
Yeah, more than anything
in the world.

05:20.530 --> 05:24.366
You're like a machine.

05:24.401 --> 05:27.269
Hey,
I just want to say,

05:27.304 --> 05:28.537
I know how you feel
about all this.

05:28.572 --> 05:30.205
And I want to thank you
for your support.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.207
I'm not supporting you.

05:32.242 --> 05:34.076
I'm still thinking
you're nuts.

05:34.144 --> 05:35.511
Oh.

05:35.545 --> 05:37.680
But as long as you've got
everyone buying into

05:37.714 --> 05:39.481
your latest brand
of crazy,

05:39.516 --> 05:41.550
I'm not gonna rain
on their parade.

05:41.585 --> 05:43.552
Lord knows, they don't have
anything else to hope for.

05:43.587 --> 05:46.288
So, until they come
to their senses,

05:46.323 --> 05:48.290
I'm supporting them.

05:48.325 --> 05:50.292
You sure that that's
what this is about.

05:50.327 --> 05:52.261
I don't know what you mean.

05:52.295 --> 05:54.730
Come on, Anne,
I'm talking about Lexi.

05:54.798 --> 05:56.398
Listen,
a lot's happened --

05:56.466 --> 05:58.467
stuff that we shouldn't
blame each other about,

05:58.501 --> 06:00.536
stuff that we shouldn't
be keeping to ourselves.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.171
I disagree.

06:02.205 --> 06:04.206
I think there are some things
that are uniquely suited

06:04.240 --> 06:05.541
to keeping to ourselves.

06:05.609 --> 06:08.243
This Beamer's
not gonna dig itself out.

06:08.278 --> 06:10.079
Sure could use
some more help out here.

06:10.113 --> 06:11.614
Where's Dingaan?

06:11.648 --> 06:12.982
He's down there with Shaq,

06:13.016 --> 06:14.416
trying to assess
the Beamer controls,

06:14.451 --> 06:16.118
which is difficult
because the parts they need

06:16.186 --> 06:17.353
are still buried.

06:17.387 --> 06:19.054
Well, they should get
their asses out

06:19.122 --> 06:20.422
of that
toasty-warm Beamer

06:20.457 --> 06:22.424
and get to work
helping us unbury it.

06:22.459 --> 06:25.094
That scorched overlord
isn't gonna be gone long.

06:25.161 --> 06:27.196
Sooner or later, he's gonna
figure out some of us survived,

06:27.230 --> 06:28.797
and he's gonna be
right back here.

06:28.832 --> 06:31.100
We're gonna dig around
the clock. I promise.

06:31.134 --> 06:33.035
Even if we do,
it's gonna take us weeks.

06:33.069 --> 06:35.671
I have a possible solution.

06:35.705 --> 06:39.675
There is...
a concealed Volm supply cache

06:39.709 --> 06:41.443
several miles from here.

06:42.812 --> 06:45.314
What are you talking about,
Volm supply cache?

06:45.348 --> 06:49.151
We studied your pioneer and
native American wars closely.

06:49.185 --> 06:51.020
Hidden supply stockpiles

06:51.054 --> 06:54.256
proved to be a vital resource
for both sides.

06:54.290 --> 06:58.160
This cache should contain tools
with advanced technology

06:58.228 --> 07:00.162
that could be used
to break up this earth

07:00.196 --> 07:02.331
and clear it away
more quickly.

07:02.365 --> 07:04.333
What?
Like a Volm backhoe?

07:04.367 --> 07:06.035
Concussion ordnances

07:06.102 --> 07:07.603
capable of shooting sound waves
deep into the earth,

07:07.637 --> 07:09.271
turning boulders into sand,

07:09.305 --> 07:11.674
which should expedite
this process immeasurably.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.842
Why are we just hearing
about this now?

07:13.877 --> 07:18.213
Espheni forces stood between
this camp and the supply cache

07:18.248 --> 07:20.049
until their recent attack.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.584
They have now scaled back their
reconnaissance in this area,

07:22.619 --> 07:25.721
but the risk is minimal.

07:25.755 --> 07:28.290
Right.

07:31.194 --> 07:33.162
Is it stuck?
Oh, I got it.

07:33.196 --> 07:34.496
Here.
Give me a second.

07:34.531 --> 07:36.832
No, let me help.
All right.

07:36.866 --> 07:38.701
It's stuck on the rebar.

07:38.735 --> 07:40.369
All right.

07:40.403 --> 07:42.104
All right, you ready?
Yeah.

07:42.138 --> 07:45.441
On 3.
1...2...3.

07:49.446 --> 07:51.113
Aah!

07:51.147 --> 07:53.115
Whoa.

07:53.149 --> 07:55.484
Who did that?!
Mother-- ugh! Ohh! You okay?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.586
No!
I fell on my wrist!

07:59.289 --> 08:01.590
All right, look, you're --
you're fine, all right?

08:01.658 --> 08:04.093
Thanks
for the sympathy.

08:04.127 --> 08:05.260
I'm so sorry.

08:05.328 --> 08:06.595
Hey, is she okay?

08:06.629 --> 08:08.130
No, she's not okay!

08:08.164 --> 08:09.765
What the hell was all that
about, man?

08:09.799 --> 08:10.744
Let's go make sure she's all right.
No, no, no, don't.

08:10.745 --> 08:12.973
Keep your skitter-neck
girlfriend away from everybody!

08:13.164 --> 08:16.633
It's bad enough we got Espheni
trying to kill us.

08:19.937 --> 08:21.405
Don't worry about him.

08:21.439 --> 08:23.774
He's right.
I'm a disaster.

08:23.808 --> 08:25.942
Everything hurts.
I can't think straight.

08:25.977 --> 08:27.611
Are you okay?

08:27.645 --> 08:29.980
No, I feel like
I'm operating new machinery,

08:30.014 --> 08:31.815
nobody gave me
the instruction manual,

08:31.849 --> 08:35.552
and I should just stay away
from everybody.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.888
No, I -- I've been through
this before.

08:37.922 --> 08:40.924
I can help you --
get used to your senses,

08:40.957 --> 08:42.926
learn how to control
your strength.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.995
Yeah, if you could do that,
that would be great.

08:45.029 --> 08:46.469
Maybe you ought to
take him up on it.

08:50.768 --> 08:53.603
Yeah, go on.

09:00.845 --> 09:03.113
Anne.

09:03.147 --> 09:04.981
What are you doing?

09:05.049 --> 09:07.150
Weaver told me about
the Volm supply cache,

09:07.218 --> 09:09.719
and I could use
some change of scenery.

09:12.090 --> 09:15.025
Wow, you really blame me,
don't you?

09:15.093 --> 09:17.127
You think I persuaded Lexi
to switch sides

09:17.161 --> 09:18.929
and murder Lourdes
in cold blood?

09:18.963 --> 09:20.464
You think
that was my idea?

09:20.498 --> 09:22.466
No.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.135
But I think you're more than
willing to try anything else,

09:25.169 --> 09:27.504
no matter how crazy,
no matter how reckless.

09:27.538 --> 09:28.839
And you know what?

09:28.873 --> 09:30.140
I do not want to
get into this with you.

09:30.174 --> 09:31.708
You know what?
Maybe you should blame me.

09:31.742 --> 09:33.577
Because when Ben came
and told us about Lexi

09:33.611 --> 09:34.878
and said that there was
no trail to follow,

09:34.912 --> 09:37.080
maybe I was looking
for a reason to move on

09:37.115 --> 09:39.616
so that our family drama
didn't wreak havoc on everybody

09:39.650 --> 09:41.618
and everything
for once!

09:41.652 --> 09:43.253
But I can't discuss that
with you.

09:43.287 --> 09:44.788
You think
that's something new, Tom?

09:44.822 --> 09:46.623
You reach a conclusion,

09:46.657 --> 09:48.525
and it's like the rest of the
world is automatically on board!

09:48.559 --> 09:50.494
Guilty as charged --
I don't think that every problem

09:50.561 --> 09:52.028
has to have
a Democratic solution,

09:52.063 --> 09:53.864
but what's happening right now
is that you're upset.

09:53.898 --> 09:55.298
And instead
of talking to me about it,

09:55.333 --> 09:57.200
you're gonna bottle that up
and live in denial.

09:57.235 --> 09:59.903
I am not living
in denial, Tom.

09:59.937 --> 10:01.538
This -- this is me.

10:01.572 --> 10:03.206
This is me that's been
on the road, surviving.

10:03.241 --> 10:05.208
This is the me who spent months
searching for our daughter,

10:05.243 --> 10:06.843
and I didn't have
a trail to follow.

10:06.878 --> 10:08.044
That was
a little different!

10:08.112 --> 10:09.679
You didn't know
what she had become!

10:09.747 --> 10:11.815
For all you knew, she was just
a little girl in trouble

10:11.849 --> 10:13.583
and probably the only family
you had left!

10:13.618 --> 10:15.085
It is more than that.

10:15.119 --> 10:17.254
I believe,
and what is pissing me off

10:17.288 --> 10:19.256
about this situation
is I don't understand why --

10:19.290 --> 10:22.225
why don't you believe?
Because I can't afford to.

10:22.260 --> 10:25.162
You get to have faith.
I have to be the realist!

10:25.196 --> 10:26.563
I'm the one that has to
weigh everything

10:26.597 --> 10:28.064
and measure everything...

10:28.099 --> 10:30.066
Even in situations
where my heart is breaking

10:30.101 --> 10:31.735
just as much as yours.

10:31.769 --> 10:34.104
We don't know
what we don't know.

10:34.138 --> 10:37.107
Maybe Lexi will come back.
Maybe she's not too far gone.

10:37.175 --> 10:39.976
Maybe -- I don't know --
in some unimaginable way,

10:40.011 --> 10:41.678
everything that happened
needed to happen

10:41.746 --> 10:43.947
so that things work out
the way they're supposed to.

10:43.981 --> 10:45.682
I don't know.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.552
I thought you said you couldn't
afford to have faith.

10:48.586 --> 10:52.589
I don't. I can't.
I have hope.

10:52.623 --> 10:55.091
There's a difference.
Faith is your department.

10:55.126 --> 10:58.094
That's why I have you.
That's why I need you.

11:00.097 --> 11:03.600
You're right.

11:03.668 --> 11:05.769
Let's just stick
to what we do.

11:05.803 --> 11:07.938
I'll kill skitters.
I'll patch people up.

11:07.972 --> 11:12.976
You'll
fly to the moon.

11:15.179 --> 11:17.113
And if we both survive,
we'll just --

11:17.181 --> 11:20.684
We'll just
figure out the rest.

11:20.718 --> 11:22.986
Deal?

11:23.054 --> 11:25.789
Deal.

11:28.292 --> 11:31.661
Quite the melodrama
back there.

11:31.696 --> 11:34.798
Stomping off,
all in a huff.

11:34.832 --> 11:36.312
You raiding the, uh,
icebox here, huh?

11:36.334 --> 11:38.034
Yeah, I'm trying to find
something for my wrist.

11:38.069 --> 11:39.236
It hurts like hell.

11:41.005 --> 11:42.806
Vicodin. I thought you said
you gave this stuff up.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.161
I am.
So, what -- you chip a nail,

11:44.175 --> 11:45.809
and you've fallen off
the wagon again?

11:45.843 --> 11:48.645
Is that it? I'll tell you,
you got one hell of a commitment

11:48.679 --> 11:50.113
to sobriety, sweetheart.

11:50.147 --> 11:51.915
Okay, you might want to shut up
right about now.

11:51.949 --> 11:53.617
Maybe you should think twice
before you go on

11:53.651 --> 11:55.418
giving these big public speeches
about the old Sarah

11:55.453 --> 11:57.354
and the new Sarah and
how you're off all this crap.

11:57.421 --> 11:59.222
'Cause you know what?
I actually believed you.

11:59.257 --> 12:00.757
What an idiot, huh?

12:02.059 --> 12:04.194
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

12:08.966 --> 12:10.800
Matt's turned into
quite the soldier --

12:10.835 --> 12:14.838
hiking for hours, low rations,
no complaints.

12:14.872 --> 12:17.040
Are you sure it was
a good idea to bring him?

12:17.074 --> 12:19.909
Cochise said
it was low-risk.

12:19.944 --> 12:21.944
It's got to be safer
than that reclamation project.

12:21.946 --> 12:23.413
There's enough
sprained ankles and cuts

12:23.447 --> 12:24.914
to last a lifetime there.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.154
What's that smell?

12:31.222 --> 12:33.690
I think it's chlorine.

12:33.724 --> 12:36.226
There are lethal patches of
toxicity throughout this area.

12:36.260 --> 12:38.928
Matthew, if you'll open
your duffel bag.

12:38.963 --> 12:41.898
Uh, sure.

12:41.932 --> 12:43.733
You'll all need to put
one of these on.

12:43.768 --> 12:47.137
Oh, lovely.

12:55.479 --> 12:57.447
Any particular reason

12:57.481 --> 13:00.483
you decided to hide your stash
in a toxic dump?

13:00.518 --> 13:03.887
The toxicity is an effective
deterrent to scavengers.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.955
We Volm
can breathe chlorine.

13:05.990 --> 13:09.826
The cache is buried 4 feet
below this cistern.

13:09.860 --> 13:12.262
I assume you have
a way to access it.

13:12.296 --> 13:14.030
Matt!

13:14.065 --> 13:16.032
Mira?

13:19.403 --> 13:21.037
Hey!

13:22.306 --> 13:24.774
Are you okay?

13:26.877 --> 13:30.880
Hang in there.

13:38.669 --> 13:39.702
She gonna be okay?

13:39.737 --> 13:42.672
I can breathe.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.841
You'll be all right over here,
away from that crap.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.043
What are you doing
out here?

13:47.077 --> 13:50.079
I finally got out.
I did it, Matt. I escaped.

13:50.114 --> 13:51.948
Matt told us
a lot about you.

13:51.982 --> 13:53.783
Sounds like you guys looked out
for each other at that camp.

13:53.817 --> 13:55.818
Matt kept me alive.

13:55.853 --> 13:57.187
I was afraid
I'd never get out of there.

13:57.221 --> 13:58.888
Yeah, how did you?

13:58.923 --> 14:00.924
I did
just what you told me to.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.358
I pretended to go along with
them until they let me graduate.

14:06.030 --> 14:07.463
What was that like?

14:07.498 --> 14:08.898
Oh, man,
it was so weird.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.900
Team leader Kent taught me
all these things,

14:10.935 --> 14:13.870
like how to find refugees,
escapees, militias,

14:13.904 --> 14:17.173
how to get them to trust you,
how to raise the alarm.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.175
Wait. W-what does that mean,
raise the alarm?

14:19.210 --> 14:20.877
There was this whistle
that we were supposed to blow

14:20.945 --> 14:22.612
if we found
any outsiders.

14:22.646 --> 14:24.887
They especially wanted us to
track down family members --

14:24.915 --> 14:27.050
people
that would trust us.

14:27.084 --> 14:29.619
The whistle calls
a Beamer strike.

14:29.653 --> 14:31.020
And then
the skitters come?

14:31.055 --> 14:32.956
No, team leaders from
the youth camp I was held in.

14:33.023 --> 14:36.893
They capture the dissidents and
take them back to the Espheni.

14:36.927 --> 14:38.728
Where's your whistle?

14:38.762 --> 14:40.897
I-I threw it in the river
as soon as I left.

14:40.931 --> 14:43.566
I didn't want any part
of that thing.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.768
I'm so glad you found me.

14:48.839 --> 14:51.774
Pretty lucky.
I was hiding in the woods,

14:51.842 --> 14:54.844
watching the road for someone
who would take me with them.

14:54.878 --> 14:57.914
And then you all came along,
and I thought I saw Matt,

14:57.948 --> 15:00.917
but I figured
it was just wishful thinking.

15:00.985 --> 15:03.052
So, you just happened
to come across us?

15:03.087 --> 15:04.487
At a Volm weapons cache.

15:04.521 --> 15:06.823
Yeah, I had no idea.

15:06.857 --> 15:09.092
Please,
you have to believe me.

15:09.126 --> 15:12.061
Mira, what I have to do is keep
everybody safe. Stand up.

15:12.129 --> 15:13.963
Dad, what are you doing?

15:13.998 --> 15:16.099
Dad, she's my friend!
I know.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.601
I hope that's true, Matt, but
I'm not gonna take any chances.

15:18.636 --> 15:20.236
Can't just leave her here!
We're not gonna leave her here.

15:20.271 --> 15:23.573
She's gonna rest here
while we do what we came to do.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:38.722 --> 15:42.025
Are these tubes
or tentacles?

15:42.059 --> 15:45.495
Espheni technology mimics
a musculoskeletal system.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.197
The cords are connected, and
their movement is coordinated.

15:48.232 --> 15:52.969
So, if I pull on...
This cord...

15:56.006 --> 15:59.676
Something moved.
I heard something.

15:59.710 --> 16:03.913
Try another.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.685
That came from over here.

16:10.254 --> 16:12.655
These two
are connected.

16:12.690 --> 16:14.657
We have to get
inside these walls

16:14.692 --> 16:16.793
and map the connections
between the cords,

16:16.860 --> 16:18.161
create a diagnostic

16:18.195 --> 16:20.863
showing which cords
control which movements.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.200
Which we can't get to until
the Beamer has been unearthed.

16:26.603 --> 16:28.571
You really think
those concussion ordnances

16:28.605 --> 16:29.906
can do the trick?

16:29.940 --> 16:31.741
Hmm.

16:33.944 --> 16:36.279
Okay,
I'll take that as a yes.

16:40.984 --> 16:43.186
Why are you following me?!

16:43.220 --> 16:45.088
Because
nobody walks away from me!

16:45.122 --> 16:47.090
Oh, God.
Think much of yourself, Pope?

16:47.124 --> 16:48.658
What do you care?!
Do you want me to be in pain?!

16:48.692 --> 16:50.827
Is that it?!
Right now?! Yes!

16:50.861 --> 16:52.328
Think this used to be a museum.
You know what? Just -- just leave me alone.

16:52.363 --> 16:53.996
Shut up, already!

16:54.031 --> 16:55.865
What?

16:55.899 --> 16:57.266
No, not you.

16:57.301 --> 16:58.902
I can hear Pope
and Sarah's conversation,

16:58.936 --> 17:00.169
and Pope's being a jerk.

17:00.204 --> 17:02.672
Sarah's voice
is a really shrill voice.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.674
You'll get used to that.

17:04.708 --> 17:07.009
Do you listen to everyone's
conversations all the time?

17:07.044 --> 17:10.279
No, not anymore. You, um...
You learn to tune things out.

17:10.314 --> 17:11.714
You know what? Get lost!

17:11.749 --> 17:13.316
God, I want them
out of my head!

17:13.349 --> 17:15.351
Focus on something else.
Come here.

17:19.056 --> 17:21.723
It's okay. Come on.
We could easily make this jump.

17:21.759 --> 17:23.626
No, no, uh,
I don't want to.

17:23.660 --> 17:24.961
It's a piece of cake.
Come on. I'll show you.

17:25.028 --> 17:26.762
Ben, just leave me alone,
all right?

17:26.797 --> 17:27.997
Back off.

17:28.031 --> 17:32.769
It's okay.
I -- I know it feels weird.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.971
No, it doesn't feel weird.
It feels invasive.

17:35.005 --> 17:37.340
Like something's crawling
inside of me, taking me over,

17:37.374 --> 17:39.208
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

17:39.276 --> 17:40.643
Maggie,
I promise, one day,

17:40.677 --> 17:42.044
you're gonna love
your new powers.

17:42.079 --> 17:44.781
You're gonna be stronger
and more badass than ever.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.884
That sounds
pretty sweet.

17:47.918 --> 17:51.220
It is. Trust me?

18:01.131 --> 18:06.702
3...2...1.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.947
You okay?

18:17.981 --> 18:21.317
My hands
are killing me.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.052
Well,
I can't untie you.

18:23.086 --> 18:27.056
I understand.

18:27.090 --> 18:29.258
I missed you so much.

18:29.293 --> 18:31.260
I missed you, too.

18:34.898 --> 18:36.199
Do they really hurt?

18:36.233 --> 18:38.367
The rope
is cutting into me.

18:38.402 --> 18:40.870
He tied it too tight.

18:43.073 --> 18:45.174
I know
I'm gonna regret this.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.710
Don't be silly.

18:51.081 --> 18:54.884
Thank you, Matt...
Really.

18:54.952 --> 18:57.887
Here.

19:02.726 --> 19:07.697
You know, it was really hard
in the camp after you left.

19:07.764 --> 19:11.067
W-well, I wanted to make you
come with us, but...

19:11.101 --> 19:15.037
I know.
But you know what?

19:15.105 --> 19:19.208
I'm actually
glad I didn't.

19:19.276 --> 19:21.944
I learned so much.

19:22.012 --> 19:23.346
What do you mean?

19:23.380 --> 19:26.048
We were wrong
about everything.

19:30.153 --> 19:32.889
You really
should have stayed.

19:32.923 --> 19:34.190
No!

19:38.756 --> 19:41.358
No, seriously, that's the most
amazing I've ever felt.

19:41.359 --> 19:43.160
I don't know how you're not
jumping off of roofs

19:43.194 --> 19:44.494
all the time.

19:44.562 --> 19:46.396
I'd be up there
every chance I got.

19:46.430 --> 19:50.534
Well, uh...I kind of was,
in the beginning.

19:50.601 --> 19:55.572
I mean, I'd sneak out at night
and jump or run faster

19:55.606 --> 19:57.240
than I've ever run
before in my life,

19:57.275 --> 19:59.109
almost like
I was in a race,

19:59.143 --> 20:01.278
except, I guess,
it was only a race with myself.

20:01.312 --> 20:03.814
Eventually, I realized
I was freaking people out,

20:03.848 --> 20:07.317
so I brought it down to
a need-to-jump basis, you know?

20:07.351 --> 20:10.220
I think I'm gonna need
to jump a lot.

20:10.254 --> 20:11.454
We can jump together.

20:11.489 --> 20:14.124
We'll just
warn everybody first.

20:14.192 --> 20:17.327
Deal.

20:17.361 --> 20:19.329
How are you feeling?

20:19.363 --> 20:22.165
Like, great, amazing.

20:22.233 --> 20:24.334
I mean, your pain
from the transplant.

20:24.368 --> 20:27.204
Is it still there?

20:27.238 --> 20:30.373
No. It's gone.

20:30.441 --> 20:35.078
I'm just realizing
it's gone.

20:35.112 --> 20:37.080
The spikes
are starting to understand

20:37.114 --> 20:40.250
that
they're part of you.

20:40.318 --> 20:43.286
Wait. You make it seem like
they've got a mind of their own.

20:43.321 --> 20:45.288
They do.

20:45.323 --> 20:47.891
This isn't just
physical strength.

20:47.925 --> 20:50.393
There's an alien life-form
fusing with your human DNA.

20:50.428 --> 20:53.530
It -- it wants to control
all of you.

20:53.564 --> 20:55.232
It wants?

20:55.299 --> 20:59.236
Yes, it has feelings,
desires

20:59.270 --> 21:02.239
stronger than anything
you've ever felt.

21:02.273 --> 21:04.908
So, I'm gonna be really,
really mad sometimes?

21:04.942 --> 21:06.576
And really,
really hungry.

21:06.644 --> 21:08.311
Oh, no.

21:08.346 --> 21:10.647
And curious and afraid

21:10.681 --> 21:16.987
and...sometimes really,
really...in love.

21:17.054 --> 21:21.157
And...When you're happy,
you're ecstatic.

21:21.192 --> 21:25.528
Sometimes I think about life
before the invasion.

21:25.563 --> 21:31.701
We were back in Boston, sitting
in my room, reading a book.

21:31.736 --> 21:35.005
And I feel so happy,
I can't stop smiling.

21:35.039 --> 21:37.207
But then...

21:41.012 --> 21:42.479
What?

21:42.513 --> 21:47.050
I think about my mom --
losing my mom.

21:50.454 --> 21:52.622
It works both ways.

22:01.332 --> 22:06.970
I can feel your sadness like...
like it's mine.

22:07.004 --> 22:08.972
That's new.

22:09.006 --> 22:11.274
Um...

22:11.342 --> 22:13.743
I guess we're just gonna have to
get used to that, too.

22:13.778 --> 22:16.413
You have to be careful,
from now on, that...

22:16.480 --> 22:18.581
It's easy
to get overwhelmed

22:18.649 --> 22:22.953
and lose yourself until...
you learn to control your power.

22:22.987 --> 22:25.288
All right.

22:25.323 --> 22:28.191
How do I do that?

22:28.225 --> 22:30.060
Use it.

22:30.094 --> 22:32.062
Ready to have some fun?

22:36.233 --> 22:38.768
Good!
Weapons.

22:38.803 --> 22:40.770
We'll take them.

22:40.805 --> 22:43.440
Outstanding.

22:43.507 --> 22:45.175
Now,
be very careful with this.

22:45.209 --> 22:46.309
What is it?

22:46.344 --> 22:48.345
Subspace
communicator.

22:48.379 --> 22:51.548
Highly tuned to all manner
of Espheni communications.

22:51.582 --> 22:54.384
This will enhance our ability
to cut through enemy firewalls

22:54.418 --> 22:56.720
to contact Volm reinforcements
light-years away.

22:56.754 --> 22:58.722
You break it,
you buy it.

22:58.756 --> 23:00.390
What about
the compression ordnance?

23:00.424 --> 23:02.092
Wasn't that the main reason
for our joyride here?

23:02.159 --> 23:03.626
Dad! Dad!

23:03.661 --> 23:06.629
I thought I told you
to leave her back there!

23:06.664 --> 23:10.033
I shouldn't have untied her!
But her hands hurt.

23:10.067 --> 23:12.669
She had this in her shoe,
and she blew it!

23:12.703 --> 23:15.171
You want to explain
yourself?!

23:16.707 --> 23:21.277
No. Let me forgive you,
Tom Mason.

23:21.345 --> 23:23.480
Oh, God,
she's on their side.

23:23.547 --> 23:26.282
We need to get
the hell out of here.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.785
Everybody take cover!
This way!

23:28.853 --> 23:30.687
Mira! Mira!

23:30.721 --> 23:33.723
I haven't located
the concussion ordnance yet.

23:33.791 --> 23:37.560
Let's go!

23:53.344 --> 23:55.779
You got something
to say to me?

23:55.813 --> 23:58.848
Not particularly,
no.

23:58.883 --> 24:01.518
No? Really, not --
not a word to say?

24:01.585 --> 24:03.086
Are you honestly
gonna stand there,

24:03.120 --> 24:04.521
debating me
on what I haven't even said yet?

24:04.555 --> 24:05.822
Unbelievable.

24:05.856 --> 24:08.158
No, you know
what's unbelievable?

24:08.192 --> 24:09.559
What's unbelievable is that
you never have to wonder

24:09.627 --> 24:11.587
what a person's really like --
I mean really like,

24:11.629 --> 24:13.096
on the inside --

24:13.130 --> 24:14.597
'cause the more
you hang out with them,

24:14.632 --> 24:16.466
the more you get to know them,
when they reveal themselves,

24:16.500 --> 24:18.635
they'll show you
exactly who they are.

24:18.669 --> 24:20.470
Do you mind?

24:20.504 --> 24:23.606
Just so I understand this
thunderous revelation of yours,

24:23.641 --> 24:27.577
what exactly do you think
that I told you I was?

24:27.611 --> 24:31.614
You're an addict.

24:31.649 --> 24:35.452
That means you're weak...
And you're a liar.

24:35.486 --> 24:37.320
Now,
I'm not the one to judge,

24:37.388 --> 24:39.823
but...
this isn't my first rodeo.

24:39.857 --> 24:42.826
I know addicts,
and I am not gonna be the one

24:42.893 --> 24:46.229
that you use
and you lie to

24:46.263 --> 24:49.532
and then move along.

24:49.567 --> 24:51.401
So bye-bye.

24:51.469 --> 24:56.606
In what way
did I use you?

24:56.640 --> 25:00.677
Tell me!
In what way did I use you?!

25:00.711 --> 25:03.246
I was fine
before I met you!

25:03.280 --> 25:04.881
I-I'd never been attacked
by skitters!

25:04.915 --> 25:06.749
I had never
killed anything!

25:06.817 --> 25:08.518
But I fought with you,
side by side,

25:08.552 --> 25:10.186
risking my life for you!

25:10.221 --> 25:12.856
And you see me with one
pill bottle in my hand,

25:12.890 --> 25:16.726
and your go-to response is that
I am a liar and a user?!

25:16.760 --> 25:19.696
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid.

25:21.298 --> 25:23.399
I think you're afraid
of what we might be.

25:23.467 --> 25:28.438
Spare me the analysis.
I'm not interested.

25:28.472 --> 25:30.607
Obviously not.

25:30.641 --> 25:32.909
You know
what's in this bottle?

25:32.977 --> 25:34.477
Vicodin!

25:34.512 --> 25:36.246
Aspirin.

25:36.280 --> 25:40.216
The labels got mixed up
when everything went to crap.

25:40.284 --> 25:45.788
You do actually have to look
to know what's inside.

25:51.662 --> 25:53.930
Matt!
Matt!

25:53.998 --> 25:56.633
Have you seen Matt?
I think he went that way!

25:56.667 --> 25:59.869
It's the team leaders
from the youth camp!

26:13.417 --> 26:15.585
Go, Joe, go! Go!

26:35.839 --> 26:38.274
Mira...Help me.

26:38.309 --> 26:39.976
It's too late for that.

26:56.493 --> 26:59.195
This one isn't going anywhere.
Get him!

27:03.567 --> 27:05.868
Mira, help me.

27:13.043 --> 27:16.012
Cochise!

27:22.219 --> 27:25.054
That stun should hold them
for a few hours.

27:25.122 --> 27:28.091
I can't see
in this thing!

27:28.125 --> 27:31.561
The air's okay here!
You can take it off.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.098
I'm empty.
You all right?

27:35.165 --> 27:36.526
I got nothing left.
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:48.278 --> 27:52.014
We need to find better cover
than this.

27:58.122 --> 28:00.957
Aah!
Anne!

28:00.991 --> 28:03.326
Ohh!
You all right?

28:03.360 --> 28:05.928
Ugh! I'm okay!

28:05.963 --> 28:07.964
Ugh.
Stay where you are!

28:09.933 --> 28:12.535
Tom Mason, this is
team leader Kent Matthews.

28:12.569 --> 28:15.872
We have your son, Matt!

28:15.939 --> 28:17.440
He is subdued!

28:17.474 --> 28:19.275
He's being collected
right now!

28:30.120 --> 28:33.356
We don't want to hurt you,
Tom!

28:33.390 --> 28:35.191
We're here to take you
to safety!

28:35.225 --> 28:37.026
The war is over.

28:37.060 --> 28:41.264
Our Espheni brothers want to
welcome us into their society!

28:41.331 --> 28:44.267
Please,
come with us, Tom.

28:58.215 --> 29:01.017
You're out of bullets,
Tom.

29:05.289 --> 29:07.557
Now it's just
a matter of time!

29:07.591 --> 29:10.059
Come out! I won't attack!

29:10.093 --> 29:12.094
Truce!

29:13.397 --> 29:14.664
Those fumes are toxic, Tom!

29:14.698 --> 29:17.166
That container could explode
at any moment!

29:17.201 --> 29:18.434
You better come out!

29:30.514 --> 29:32.215
Hey, wait!

29:32.249 --> 29:34.450
Anne?

29:34.484 --> 29:36.252
Hey, wait!

29:36.286 --> 29:38.054
Ugh!

30:05.682 --> 30:09.318
How could you do this
to your own people?

30:09.353 --> 30:13.489
Progress is made when we embrace
our Espheni brothers.

30:15.659 --> 30:20.463
I'm not a traitor.
I'm a new patriot.

30:29.373 --> 30:32.174
Tom...

30:32.209 --> 30:35.344
I gave them...my mother.

30:52.496 --> 30:55.498
Here you are.
Here you are.

30:58.535 --> 31:01.037
Here he is.
Hey.

31:01.071 --> 31:02.705
Dad.

31:12.860 --> 31:14.327
You decided to stay?

31:14.362 --> 31:15.996
What are
you talking about?

31:17.565 --> 31:20.033
I figured you were going
with Sarah.

31:20.101 --> 31:22.002
She came by
a few hours ago,

31:22.036 --> 31:24.805
picked up a rifle,
a couple days' rations.

31:24.872 --> 31:26.039
How?

31:26.073 --> 31:27.908
She said she knew
of a nearby farm

31:27.975 --> 31:29.810
where there might be
some food.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.312
I just assumed
you were going with her.

31:37.552 --> 31:41.054
Okay, let's see
what you can do.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.028
Bull's-eye.

31:58.806 --> 32:01.441
Keep going. Plenty more
where that came from.

32:21.028 --> 32:23.930
How do
you like me now?

32:29.937 --> 32:32.906
I like you too much.

33:03.070 --> 33:05.338
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No.

33:05.406 --> 33:06.539
I shouldn't
have done that.

33:06.574 --> 33:09.175
I'm glad you did,
but...

33:09.243 --> 33:12.045
Hal.
Yeah.

33:12.079 --> 33:14.381
Oh, my God,
am I going crazy?

33:14.415 --> 33:16.049
I...

33:17.485 --> 33:19.319
Since I woke up
with the spikes,

33:19.353 --> 33:21.321
I feel, uh,
like I'm drawn to you.

33:21.355 --> 33:23.390
Yeah,
and you didn't before?

33:23.424 --> 33:25.926
No, I love --
I love Hal.

33:27.261 --> 33:30.263
This, um...
This feels different.

33:30.298 --> 33:32.399
God,
this is so intense.

33:32.466 --> 33:35.602
I, um...

33:35.636 --> 33:38.371
I really want to kiss you
right now.

33:40.408 --> 33:42.008
Don't.

33:42.043 --> 33:44.210
I know. I know.

33:44.245 --> 33:47.113
I know.

33:49.550 --> 33:52.252
Oh, God.

33:52.286 --> 33:56.122
Looks like we're in
the clear...for the time being.

33:56.157 --> 33:58.291
I owe you all
an apology.

33:58.326 --> 34:01.328
I misled you,
put you at unnecessary risk,

34:01.362 --> 34:04.497
and we did not even retrieve
the essential item we came for.

34:04.532 --> 34:07.033
We'll just
have to dig a little harder

34:07.068 --> 34:10.103
when we get back,
Cochise.

34:10.137 --> 34:12.072
How are you doing?

34:12.139 --> 34:13.606
It hurts...

34:13.641 --> 34:15.475
Like a thousand needles
sticking into me.

34:15.509 --> 34:17.476
Bet it does.

34:17.511 --> 34:21.147
Sorry about being
such an idiot about Mira.

34:21.181 --> 34:22.349
You're 13.

34:22.382 --> 34:24.050
Puppy love is not easy,

34:24.085 --> 34:25.518
especially when
it's life-and-death.

34:25.553 --> 34:27.353
It's not puppy love,
Dad.

34:30.424 --> 34:34.360
I'd tell you to forget about
her, but I doubt you could.

34:34.428 --> 34:36.096
Strange as it sounds,

34:36.130 --> 34:38.098
you should try to remember
the feeling you had for her.

34:38.132 --> 34:40.100
The feeling is important.

34:40.134 --> 34:42.469
Why?

34:44.572 --> 34:47.440
'Cause it's pretty rare in life
when you meet somebody

34:47.475 --> 34:50.176
who cares about you
as much as you do about them.

34:56.117 --> 34:58.184
Hey.

34:58.219 --> 34:59.519
Hey, how did things go
with Maggie?

34:59.553 --> 35:02.222
Fine.
Good.

35:02.256 --> 35:03.656
Hey, hey.

35:03.691 --> 35:06.493
Those, uh --
those spikes of yours --

35:06.527 --> 35:08.361
they help you heal quickly,
right?

35:08.429 --> 35:10.296
Yeah.
Good.

35:10.331 --> 35:13.733
Ugh! Oh, oh!

35:13.768 --> 35:18.004
You were supposed to help Maggie
adjust to her spikes.

35:18.039 --> 35:19.305
Doesn't mean it's open season
on my girlfriend.

35:19.340 --> 35:21.207
Hal, I would never --
You know what, Ben?

35:21.242 --> 35:22.675
Just save it, okay?
Because I saw you.

35:22.710 --> 35:24.210
And, look, I get it.

35:24.245 --> 35:27.180
She's gorgeous. She's amazing.
But she's mine.

35:27.248 --> 35:28.715
I'm sorry.

35:28.749 --> 35:31.117
I didn't see
your leash on her.

35:36.624 --> 35:39.559
Just stay away from her.

35:48.524 --> 35:51.726
Hey, everybody.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.595
I was starting to worry
about you guys.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.597
We ran into a little trouble.
We made it out.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.599
Dad!

35:57.633 --> 35:59.500
Everything go okay?

36:02.571 --> 36:04.272
What happened
to your face?

36:04.340 --> 36:06.507
Nothing.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.344
Okay.

36:09.378 --> 36:11.212
Dingaan.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.214
Ah. How goes the alien
small-engine repair?

36:13.282 --> 36:14.749
Not great.

36:14.783 --> 36:17.719
The rubble prevents us getting
to the necessary controls.

36:17.753 --> 36:19.220
Were you able to
bring back that tool

36:19.254 --> 36:20.335
to help us raise
the Beamer?

36:20.356 --> 36:21.556
No, we got ambushed.

36:21.590 --> 36:23.424
The cache was destroyed.

36:23.459 --> 36:26.027
Back to square one, but it
wouldn't be the first time.

36:26.095 --> 36:27.562
Let's get these weapons
and supplies stowed

36:27.596 --> 36:29.564
before we get
some shut-eye.

36:32.768 --> 36:35.103
I did find this.

36:35.137 --> 36:37.238
Supposedly,
this can call Beamers.

36:37.272 --> 36:39.107
I don't know
if it's a tone or a frequency.

36:39.141 --> 36:40.742
See what you can do with it.
Be careful.

36:40.776 --> 36:42.243
Do not blow that.

36:42.277 --> 36:44.445
I'll take it to Shaq
right away. Coming?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.381
Yeah.

36:47.583 --> 36:50.585
Now...

36:50.619 --> 36:53.254
Anything you boys
need to tell me?

36:55.257 --> 36:56.791
No.

37:02.731 --> 37:05.600
Okay.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.242
So, let me see
if I remember this correctly.

37:14.276 --> 37:15.743
We were surrounded.

37:15.811 --> 37:18.613
Situation sucked,
and only one way out,

37:18.647 --> 37:21.149
and that's for one of us
to be dead -- me.

37:21.183 --> 37:23.851
One has to be smart
and stay alive -- you.

37:23.886 --> 37:27.388
Those are the basic rules
of engagement.

37:27.423 --> 37:29.557
Used to teach a course on it at
Bunker Hill Community College.

37:29.591 --> 37:31.559
Oh, give me a break.

37:31.593 --> 37:34.429
But instead of doing
the smart thing, you...

37:34.463 --> 37:37.632
If my memory serves,
ran out without a weapon,

37:37.666 --> 37:39.834
without a plan,
and yelled --

37:39.868 --> 37:41.836
what was it, again? --
"Hey, wait"?

37:41.870 --> 37:43.571
I didn't know
what else to say.

37:43.605 --> 37:46.641
"Hey, wait"? That was your big
master kamikaze plan?

37:46.709 --> 37:48.376
"Hey, wait,
look over here!

37:48.410 --> 37:50.411
Hey, wait, don't shoot him!
Shoot me!"

37:50.446 --> 37:53.214
I thought
you were going to die.

37:53.282 --> 37:56.084
I know.

37:56.118 --> 37:58.786
I probably would have done
the same dumbass thing

37:58.821 --> 38:01.756
if you were the one
getting shot.

38:01.790 --> 38:04.525
But I've been thinking.

38:04.593 --> 38:08.496
Maybe there's a reason
the bullets missed you.

38:08.530 --> 38:10.698
When you said to me,
"if we survive this,

38:10.733 --> 38:12.133
we'll figure out the rest,"

38:12.167 --> 38:13.488
that was very hard
for me to hear,

38:13.502 --> 38:14.736
because I don't really know
what "the rest" means,

38:14.770 --> 38:20.441
but...then I realized
I don't really care.

38:20.509 --> 38:25.146
Whether it's a long time
or a short time,

38:25.180 --> 38:30.218
I just want to spend it
with you...if you'll have me.

38:30.252 --> 38:33.187
That sounds like --

38:33.222 --> 38:35.723
It is.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.294
My God.

38:40.329 --> 38:42.130
I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.

38:43.665 --> 38:45.500
But will you marry me?

38:47.736 --> 38:49.403
Yes.

38:49.438 --> 38:50.705
Wait.

38:50.739 --> 38:52.707
How do we know
we're doing the right thing?

38:52.741 --> 38:55.243
We don't. We don't.

38:55.277 --> 38:58.412
But I have hope.

38:58.447 --> 39:00.615
Yes.

39:00.649 --> 39:02.216
Yes.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.769
Hmm.

39:21.804 --> 39:24.338
I promise to always have
your back in a firefight,

39:24.373 --> 39:26.340
and I promise
to try not to get killed.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.876
I promise
to do the same.

39:31.280 --> 39:36.918
So, Anne...
Do you take this man...

39:36.952 --> 39:40.488
For better, for worse...

39:43.325 --> 39:46.594
...for richer, for poorer....

39:46.628 --> 39:49.463
till death do you part?

39:49.531 --> 39:52.633
Yeah. I do.

39:52.668 --> 39:55.436
I do, too.

39:55.470 --> 40:00.508
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you may kiss the bride.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.449
Tom Mason...
I must speak with you.

40:08.483 --> 40:10.551
For God's sake,
we're having a wedding here!

40:10.586 --> 40:12.553
You may resume
your ritual

40:12.588 --> 40:14.622
after I speak to Tom Mason
about the Beamer.

40:16.525 --> 40:20.361
The Beamer is important.

40:20.429 --> 40:21.996
Congratulations.

40:25.067 --> 40:28.369
So, why the hell
did you interrupt?!

40:28.403 --> 40:30.905
I have been deconstructing
the Espheni whistle

40:30.939 --> 40:32.573
you brought back.

40:32.608 --> 40:34.008
You are correct.

40:34.042 --> 40:36.777
It communicates
directly with the Beamer...

40:36.812 --> 40:38.012
Engaging the engine.

40:38.046 --> 40:39.480
Okay,
what else can it do?

40:41.550 --> 40:43.751
Can it access
the homing beacon on the moon?

40:43.819 --> 40:47.321
A different signal
is required

40:47.356 --> 40:50.625
to direct the Beamer
to a certain location...But --

40:50.659 --> 40:52.994
But he's saying
it's one hell of a start,

40:53.028 --> 40:55.529
you crazy
son of a bitch.

40:55.564 --> 40:59.533
I was able to isolate the homing
amplitude of the whistle.

40:59.568 --> 41:02.737
It is an ultrasonic frequency
that humans can't hear

41:02.771 --> 41:05.439
and human tech
wouldn't know to look for.

41:05.474 --> 41:07.642
I've captured the signal
within this communicator.

41:07.676 --> 41:11.479
Okay.
How does it help us?

41:17.552 --> 41:19.353
Whoa, whoa.

41:19.388 --> 41:21.689
Stand back!

41:21.723 --> 41:23.691
Back!

41:52.821 --> 41:55.356
I guess that's how.

41:55.390 --> 41:57.708
We choose
to go to the moon.
