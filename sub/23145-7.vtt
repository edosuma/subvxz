Beach!

00:09.476 --> 00:10.675
Beach!

00:12.146 --> 00:13.411
Beach!

00:15.054 --> 00:17.216
Beach!

00:18.619 --> 00:20.753
Beach!

00:22.222 --> 00:23.422
Beach?

00:25.225 --> 00:26.234
Beach.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.654
Aah! Ha!

00:55.722 --> 00:56.921
Ha! Ha!

01:06.400 --> 01:09.534
Hm, I wish these weren't so salty.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.169
Steve! Steve-Steve!

01:11.238 --> 01:12.337
Steeeve!

01:12.339 --> 01:14.206
You. Me. Water-rocket boots.

01:14.274 --> 01:17.141
Everyone else... eyes like these.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.612
You know I don't go in the ocean.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.147
I've got a shark phobia.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.216
You're afraid of sharks?
That's ridiculous.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.284
Just look at you.
You're too afraid to be in the sun.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.886
You're too afraid to go in the water.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.489
Oh, let me guess,
you're too afraid to eat sand?

01:30.557 --> 01:32.024
Not really <i> afraid...</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:33.826
Fear is a mental prison.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.161
Behold, the power of the mind!

01:37.832 --> 01:39.698
Jesus, Dad!

01:39.766 --> 01:42.767
And this... is what...

01:42.837 --> 01:44.503
a free man looks like.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.841
Wow, you're not afraid of anything.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.709
Are you afraid of little kisses?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.110
Mwah!

01:52.179 --> 01:54.670
How about a little kiss
on your chin? Mwah!

01:54.682 --> 01:56.059
How 'bout your belly?

01:56.117 --> 01:57.254
Mwah!

01:57.418 --> 02:00.414
And what's this? Oh, hello!

02:00.454 --> 02:02.320
Mwah!

02:34.755 --> 02:36.154
Sorry about that whole

02:36.223 --> 02:38.090
"going down on you at the beach"
misunderstanding.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.758
Here's a free Bloody Mary.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.095
But with SpaghettiO sauce and
a Twizzler instead of celery.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.164
Alcoholic drinks for kids
are an untapped market.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.766
No one ever thinks of the children.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.902
I can't stop thinking about a child.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.436
<i>My</i> child.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.171
The Steve-child.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.441
Cool. So I guess we're done
with what I was talking about?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.577
Steve's shark phobia is just the start.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.913
If he continues to be
a slave to his fears,

03:00.981 --> 03:02.380
he's gonna miss out on life.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.183
Hey! Maybe Dr. Penguin could
help him work through it.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.786
Oh, Stan. Dr. Penguin died.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.521
Did you not get invited to the funeral?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.256
It was a tiny, little thing...

03:11.258 --> 03:12.324
at the Spearmint Rhino.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.992
- Super intimate.
- Are you finished?

03:14.060 --> 03:15.727
There wasn't a dry thigh in the...

03:15.796 --> 03:17.329
Roger! What do I do about Steve?

03:17.397 --> 03:19.864
Well, as my mentor, Dr. Penguin...

03:19.934 --> 03:21.600
RIP, one love, gone but not forgotten...

03:21.668 --> 03:24.869
used to say,
"When you're forced to confront a fear,

03:24.871 --> 03:26.538
that fear loses its power."

03:26.607 --> 03:28.607
Yeah! That sounds like a thing!

03:28.675 --> 03:29.808
It sure is.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.076
And I happen to have another persona

03:31.145 --> 03:32.611
that could help with Steve's problem.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.813
Just get him in the ocean,
and I'll do the rest.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.283
Great. Wow, so Penguin died, huh?
What happened?

03:38.352 --> 03:39.618
It came out of nowhere.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.686
He saw a movie he liked at Sundance,

03:41.755 --> 03:44.289
just walked off into the forest.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.490
Danuta, I can't wait

03:45.492 --> 03:46.891
to hear all about your
semester in Chile.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.761
Girl, I bet you learned to fry up

03:48.829 --> 03:50.829
a badass bloomin' onion.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.831
Not Chili's, Mom. Chile.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.299
It's a country.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.955
Ah, you girls keep me young.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.838
So, my Saturn's
officially a piece of shit.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.439
I had to take it to the shop <i> again,</i>

04:01.508 --> 04:03.375
so I'll be catching the
bus for the next week.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.044
The one positive is that
riding with all those low-lifes

04:06.112 --> 04:07.712
is a real confidence booster.

04:07.782 --> 04:10.148
I feel like freakin' JFK on there.

04:10.290 --> 04:12.785
Guess that makes the homeless
guy whacking off in the aisle

04:12.853 --> 04:14.586
my Jackie O.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.988
What's his deal?

04:16.055 --> 04:18.523
He's... kinda hot.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.533
Klaus?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.259
Yeah, he seems funny.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.996
I mean, if he's even available.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.332
Uh, he goes to the DMV "just to chill."

04:27.401 --> 04:28.533
I think he's available.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.668
Hook it up, then.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.135
Enough about Klaus.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.138
Our girl's back in town.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.540
So, what else have you been
up to, Danuta?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.809
Start at birth

04:36.877 --> 04:39.878
since this is the first
time we've ever met.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.215
How ya likin' old Francine so far?

04:48.321 --> 04:49.654
Ahh.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.199
Oh, my God!

05:00.267 --> 05:01.446
Ahoy there!

05:01.668 --> 05:03.068
Can I dog ya, my man?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.403
Where am I?!

05:04.471 --> 05:05.937
Uh, the ocean?

05:06.006 --> 05:08.339
A percentage of the
world is covered in it.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.541
Just ribbin' ya, son.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.742
I know you're confused

05:10.744 --> 05:12.143
because of my unnecessary trick.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.945
Did you feel like a giant in there?

05:13.947 --> 05:16.015
The whole room was 7/8th scale.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.816
That was the second part of my trick.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.484
Here's the third part.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.782
Aaaaaah!

05:20.954 --> 05:22.554
Aaaaaah!

05:22.623 --> 05:24.022
Don't trick me back, Steve.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.357
I can dish it out, but I cannot take it.

05:26.359 --> 05:28.694
Aah! Aah! Aah!

05:30.564 --> 05:32.898
Aaaah!

05:32.966 --> 05:36.501
Shark-shark-shark-shark-shark-
shark-shark-shark-shark!

05:37.466 --> 05:38.467
Come on, ya little wuss.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.039
Hit me so I can get out of here.

05:49.335 --> 05:50.582
Oh, my God, Steve!

05:50.651 --> 05:52.651
You were just face-to-face with a shark.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.786
I... I was terrified.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.521
But I was splashing around

05:56.590 --> 05:58.790
and... and bopped him on the nose,

05:58.792 --> 06:00.659
and I think I scared <i> him.</i>

06:00.728 --> 06:03.462
I'd say he was probably
more afraid than you were.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.597
I kicked his ass.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.667
I just kicked that shark's ass!

06:08.736 --> 06:11.138
I made that shark my bitch!

06:11.173 --> 06:14.460
Looks like tuna isn't the
only chicken of the sea.

06:14.495 --> 06:16.691
- See? Nothing to worry about.
- You're right.

06:16.726 --> 06:18.944
'Cause I dominated a friggin' shark.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.079
Up top!

06:22.549 --> 06:24.683
Aaaaaaaaah!

06:29.890 --> 06:31.690
Thank God, the bleeding stopped.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.892
I think I'm out of bloo...

06:33.961 --> 06:36.962
You're gonna be okay, son. Stay with me.

06:37.030 --> 06:40.499
There. There's my angel's smile.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.006
Holy hell, Roger.
How could you bite Steve's arm off?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.875
Now he's gonna be afraid
of his own shadow.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.344
What you're forgetting is
the very important lesson

06:52.412 --> 06:53.812
I <i> did</i> teach him...

06:53.881 --> 06:55.481
Don't talk shit about sharks.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.817
Just give me back his arm so
the doctor can reattach it.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.422
Should be good as new...

07:04.492 --> 07:06.358
My stomach runs about 10° Fahrenheit.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.759
It comes in very handy.

07:07.828 --> 07:08.960
Did you know I'm the number-three

07:09.029 --> 07:11.229
Carvel franchise in
the state of Virginia?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.498
Want me to puke you up a sundae

07:12.566 --> 07:14.833
in one of those cute
little baseball helmets?

07:14.835 --> 07:15.901
Who's your team, Stan?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.369
Hope you're a Marlins fan!

07:23.844 --> 07:25.110
Steve?

07:25.179 --> 07:26.311
I brought you a little something

07:26.380 --> 07:28.380
to say sorry about what happened.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.182
I'm not sorry it happened.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.517
Wha... What?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.985
I came face-to-face
with my greatest fear,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.854
and I made it out the other side.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.255
You were right.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.124
I've wasted my whole
life living in fear.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.259
Well, I'm finally free.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.729
No more closing my eyes
in the cereal aisle

07:43.797 --> 07:45.330
for fear of seeing Boo Berry.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.999
And I'm gonna wear this
stump as a badge of honor...

07:48.068 --> 07:51.069
A reminder to not be afraid of anything.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.739
No even the dread pirate,
Captain Crunch.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.074
Wow. Really?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.809
I thought you'd be...

07:57.878 --> 08:00.545
- Now, what'd you bring me?
- Uh...

08:01.615 --> 08:05.617
- Hey!
- I brought you this Dikembe Mutombo jersey.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.019
Can I help ya, buddy?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.221
I'm just trying to talk
to my deformed son,

08:09.289 --> 08:10.622
and you're just standing there,

08:10.690 --> 08:12.424
binge-watching the whole conversation.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.026
Put the jersey on, Steve.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.162
That jersey looks real good
on ya, Steve.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.764
Buying that jersey for you

08:18.832 --> 08:21.567
was one of the great joys of my life.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.902
Your ice cream.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.239
I'm so jacked up to go rocket bootin'!

08:27.307 --> 08:28.907
I don't think I want to do this...

08:30.044 --> 08:32.778
I knew losing your arm
wouldn't change you.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.080
...because I'd rather do <i> that.</i>

08:36.650 --> 08:37.849
Aah!

08:37.918 --> 08:39.317
Aww!

08:39.318 --> 08:42.120
Aah! This is amazing!

08:42.121 --> 08:43.922
I'm lovin' the new Steve.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.591
Stump-bump it!

08:45.659 --> 08:47.993
Maybe after it heals.

08:50.908 --> 08:53.265
You know, after hearing both sides,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.400
I'm kind of with these deadbeat dads.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.536
Hey, Klaus, you remember
my friend Danuta, right?

08:58.606 --> 08:59.671
Of course.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.940
Bangin' bod. Super long fingers.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.675
Total smoke show.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.612
Well, the other day,
she said you were "kinda hot."

09:06.680 --> 09:08.080
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

09:08.148 --> 09:11.016
Yeah, baby! It's on!

09:11.084 --> 09:12.484
Nothing like a sure thing.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.753
She's fine as hell, and I'm...

09:15.755 --> 09:17.889
gonna blow it.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.692
I can't bag a dime like Danuta.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.295
Agh! She's too hot!

09:23.363 --> 09:24.362
Agh!

09:24.364 --> 09:25.831
Wait, are you messing with me?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.232
I will kill you!

09:27.301 --> 09:29.301
Relax! I'm not messing with you.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.036
Call her. Right now. Prove it.

09:31.105 --> 09:32.838
I don't really think that's necessary.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.440
Do it.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.374
Okay, okay!

09:37.845 --> 09:38.910
'Sup, whore?

09:38.979 --> 09:39.988
What up, 'Nutes?

09:40.047 --> 09:41.246
So, um...

09:41.315 --> 09:43.115
who was I supposed to
set you up with again?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.117
Klaus. He's kinda hot.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.455
What's that noise?

09:49.523 --> 09:52.680
Uh, Wendy Williams is benching
300 pounds on her show!

09:52.715 --> 09:54.660
Oh, my God, she's really
doing it! Bye!

09:54.728 --> 09:56.261
There you go. Believe it now?

09:56.330 --> 09:59.264
Ohhh, that broad was built to bang!

09:59.333 --> 10:01.199
You really shouldn't let
her call you a whore.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.469
I-I know it's a joke,
but it's just kind of bad

10:03.537 --> 10:05.403
for women in general, you know?

10:05.405 --> 10:08.740
Oh, and tell Danuta to get fully waxed.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.209
But not the butthole.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.213
Damn. We high up.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.682
Didn't even notice.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.616
You know,
I think all my fear was in that arm.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.418
You guys should really
consider cutting yours off.

10:20.488 --> 10:22.154
Hey, how cool is the view?

10:22.222 --> 10:24.089
Think that's cool? Check this out.

10:25.389 --> 10:26.958
Lifted it from my old man.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.293
So badass!

10:28.362 --> 10:30.268
Okay, Steve, stop messing around.

10:30.303 --> 10:31.697
- We're just having a good time.
- Quit it.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.231
- Seriously, man, that's not funny.
- What... What are you afraid of?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.833
- A little pop gun?
- Cut it out, Steve!

10:34.835 --> 10:35.934
- Stop playing around, man!
- Pop! Pop! Pop!

10:36.436 --> 10:37.836
Hey, Stan, just checking in.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.372
- You still think Steve's doing great?
- Yep.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.707
Really? You don't...
You don't think he's

10:41.775 --> 10:43.709
acting a bit...

10:43.777 --> 10:45.243
- reckless?
- No.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.045
Just the other day,
he made Toshi give him

10:47.114 --> 10:49.781
a lower-back tattoo
with a rusty paperclip.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.249
It's a Ninja Turtle.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.384
Yeah, Raphael.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.119
He's the rude dude of the group.

10:54.188 --> 10:55.653
Steve is clearly out of control.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.723
Well, it's better than
being afraid of the world.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.392
He put his whole mouth around
the water-fountain spout

11:00.460 --> 11:02.127
at the little-league park! I saw it!

11:02.196 --> 11:04.156
The boy's just getting
it all out of his system.

11:04.191 --> 11:05.339
He'll be fine.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.008
Argh!

11:11.939 --> 11:14.472
Classic horseplay.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.215
Francine, have you seen Steve?

11:23.283 --> 11:26.017
Buscemi? Everywhere.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.954
But that might be the
Lemon Pledge talking.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.288
We're looking for Steve,

11:30.290 --> 11:31.957
the child you occasionally mother

11:32.025 --> 11:33.425
in your more lucid moments.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.028
Oh, he said he was going
to the comic-book store

11:36.096 --> 11:37.495
to do battle or something.

11:37.565 --> 11:40.899
See, Roger? He's back
to playing his Pokémon cards.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.568
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

11:42.636 --> 11:44.001
He left his Bulbasaur!

11:44.036 --> 11:45.303
He might as well be going to battle

11:45.305 --> 11:46.704
with an army of Jigglypuffs.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.574
Relax, I'm sure Steve has a Hoobastank

11:48.642 --> 11:50.642
or a couple of
Chumbawambas up his sleeve.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.178
This is pretty reckless
behavior if you ask me.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.247
Fine. We'll bring him his stupid card.

11:55.650 --> 11:57.103
Now, where was I?

11:57.317 --> 12:00.586
So, what was it like
working with Tarantino?

12:00.654 --> 12:02.053
I don't know.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.055
What's it like being so beautiful?

12:09.181 --> 12:10.929
Yo, neckbeard. You seen a kid?

12:10.998 --> 12:12.264
We're looking for Steve Smith.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.402
Oh, thank God you're here for him.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.605
That's been non-stop.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.740
Oh, that?
The boy's a bit of a gigglepuss.

12:21.809 --> 12:25.143
A true chuckle-nut.
Guffaw-hound, really.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.612
Probably just tickle...

12:26.680 --> 12:28.680
fighting?

12:30.550 --> 12:32.618
I feel so alive!

12:35.956 --> 12:37.155
Oh, hey, Dad.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.424
Lose the shirt and hop in the ring.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.758
Snot's been dying to
fight you for years.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.762
Oh, Snot will get his.
But he will not see it coming.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.096
I'm worried about you, son.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.898
Why? I'm on top of the world.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.635
Roger, could you give me a... hand?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.911
What the hell is going on inside you?

12:59.980 --> 13:02.180
Is that... my arm?

13:02.249 --> 13:05.517
Steve, Roger and I
staged the entire attack.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.618
I was the shark!

13:06.686 --> 13:09.988
So... I never confronted anything?

13:09.990 --> 13:13.258
All my confidence is based on a lie?

13:13.327 --> 13:16.128
Oh, my God, is this my blood?!

13:16.196 --> 13:17.997
Aaaah-ha-ha-ha!

13:19.399 --> 13:21.778
We got our Steve back.

13:21.813 --> 13:24.002
I haven't changed at all.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.036
Chin up, buddy.

13:25.822 --> 13:28.273
- There, there.
- More! More! More!

13:28.342 --> 13:30.342
Ay, paisan, you angry?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.010
Then why don't you tell me to fon-jewel!

13:33.413 --> 13:34.880
You want in on this?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.415
Uh... Oh!

13:37.417 --> 13:38.950
Look what I caught Steve doin'!

13:40.220 --> 13:42.287
Come on, Klaus, just call Danuta.

13:42.356 --> 13:45.223
Um, calling a girl is so desperate.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.825
Can't I just draw a penis on a brick

13:46.827 --> 13:48.894
and throw it through her
family's living-room window?

13:48.962 --> 13:49.971
Are you nervous?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.497
No, I'm not nervous.

13:53.231 --> 13:54.266
This phone's nervous.

13:57.084 --> 13:58.904
Hello?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.038
Danuta.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.374
Who is this?

14:02.442 --> 14:03.509
Danuta.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.777
Who's calling?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.245
It is me.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.047
What?

14:09.116 --> 14:10.516
Will you go there?

14:10.584 --> 14:13.185
Go where? What?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.586
Do you eat?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.188
What the hell is this?!

14:16.256 --> 14:19.791
I've got the money...

14:20.162 --> 14:21.482
Danuta.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.795
Klaus, that was... chilling.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.063
I blacked out.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.732
Hey, let's just take the pressure off.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.933
M-Make it a group date.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.001
Do you have any friends
you could invite?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.270
Do I have any friends?

14:32.272 --> 14:35.864
Someone's obviously forgotten
about my boy Jurgen.

14:35.899 --> 14:37.111
How could I forget about a guy

14:37.146 --> 14:39.855
I caught stealing used
Q-tips out of my trash can?

14:39.890 --> 14:42.748
Exactly! He's unforgettable.

14:45.869 --> 14:47.001
Knock, knock.

14:47.070 --> 14:49.137
Any two-armed boys in here?

14:49.172 --> 14:51.539
Would you settle for a two-armed man

14:51.608 --> 14:52.740
who was hospitalized for eating

14:52.809 --> 14:55.176
an entire American Girl doll?

14:56.946 --> 14:58.213
Where'd my son go?

14:58.281 --> 15:00.081
He said something about living a lie

15:00.149 --> 15:03.885
and needing to conquer his
fear by killing a shark.

15:06.089 --> 15:08.089
Your bloodthirsty quest reminds me

15:08.157 --> 15:10.958
of my childhood in Bon Temps, Louisiana.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.562
Yes, I am from the town in "True Blood,"

15:14.564 --> 15:16.030
but at the time, I was unawares

15:16.099 --> 15:19.634
of any goings on of any
vampire shenanigans.

15:19.702 --> 15:23.504
Oh, that town was overrun with vampires!

15:23.573 --> 15:24.972
And many of the dogs I would see

15:25.041 --> 15:27.909
I would later realize were werewolves.

15:31.614 --> 15:33.614
Hurry, Roger! We gotta stop Steve

15:33.684 --> 15:35.216
before he throws down with a shark.

15:35.218 --> 15:38.687
Easy, Stan. I'm takin'
ya straight to great-white country.

15:38.755 --> 15:40.821
Just need to make a little detour.

15:40.823 --> 15:42.757
There's a sunken wheelchair around here.

15:42.825 --> 15:44.693
My theory? I think it fell off a boat.

15:44.761 --> 15:47.828
Roger, my son's gonna die,
and it's all my fault.

15:47.898 --> 15:51.366
Unless... some guy wheeled
it across the ocean floor?

15:51.434 --> 15:53.101
Is that your theory, Stan?

15:53.170 --> 15:54.769
Yes, yes, talk me through it.

15:54.837 --> 15:56.304
I think I could be convinced.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.509
Say something to her.

16:02.224 --> 16:04.445
Danuta, um...

16:04.514 --> 16:07.115
what's, like, the grossest disease
you've ever gotten?

16:07.183 --> 16:10.651
Um... I don't know. Gingivitis?

16:10.653 --> 16:12.453
Oh-ho-ho. That's it?

16:12.455 --> 16:13.922
Play your cards right,

16:13.990 --> 16:16.591
and later I'll give you
something <i> much</i> worse.

16:16.659 --> 16:18.326
You're funny.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.794
Jurgen, put me down.

16:19.862 --> 16:23.264
Let me win shorty over
here a stuffed Munion.

16:26.469 --> 16:30.871
Someone call a doctor,
'cause my jump shot is sick!

16:33.676 --> 16:36.277
Just clearing out the cobwebs.

16:36.346 --> 16:37.355
Tell 'em, Jurgen.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.423
Yep.

16:41.017 --> 16:42.217
Swish!

16:43.954 --> 16:46.687
Klaus, maybe we should move on.

16:46.689 --> 16:48.957
I'm winning her a prize!

16:52.829 --> 16:55.163
Why don't we go on a ride?

16:55.231 --> 16:57.098
Besides, there's someone

16:57.100 --> 16:59.167
I'd rather cuddle with
than a stuffed animal.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.369
How can I concentrate with
you jabbering in my ear?!

17:01.438 --> 17:04.839
You keep begging me and begging
me for this [BLEEP] Munion,

17:04.907 --> 17:07.308
then flap your lips
every time I take a shot!

17:07.310 --> 17:09.176
I'm... sorry?

17:09.246 --> 17:10.444
Take a lap, Danuta.

17:10.512 --> 17:13.513
All of you! Just let me work.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.588
Where are these damn sharks?

17:19.656 --> 17:20.855
While we're waitin', can I interest you

17:20.923 --> 17:23.191
in corn hole, some beer pong?

17:24.595 --> 17:26.795
No! I'm... I'm trying
to stare down death.

17:26.863 --> 17:27.996
Why do you have all this stuff?

17:28.064 --> 17:30.064
'Cause this here's a party boat.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.866
I wish I could pay the bills

17:31.934 --> 17:33.534
taking one-armed boys shark-killing

17:33.536 --> 17:35.069
to prove how brave they are,

17:35.138 --> 17:37.538
but, sadly, that's just not
the world we're living in.

17:37.608 --> 17:41.276
Now, are we going to buttchug
some Southern Comfort or...

17:41.344 --> 17:43.544
Shark!

17:43.614 --> 17:46.881
This is it. Time to conquer my fears.

17:48.551 --> 17:50.719
Yaaah!

17:51.888 --> 17:54.355
Yes! I did it!

17:54.357 --> 17:56.491
- Oh.
- Well, butter my biscuit.

17:56.559 --> 17:58.426
You killed a cute, little baby.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.296
Wahh! Wahh! Change my diaper!

18:01.364 --> 18:02.763
Don't murder me!

18:02.765 --> 18:05.433
And I'm guessin' that's his ma and pa.

18:08.630 --> 18:09.838
Did you know that sharks can have

18:09.906 --> 18:11.506
up to 50 rows of teeth?

18:11.574 --> 18:13.508
I'm great with trivia like that.

18:13.576 --> 18:15.776
Ask me Lady Gaga's real name.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.648
Stefani Germanotta.

18:19.716 --> 18:22.651
$260, $280, $300.

18:22.719 --> 18:24.553
Now give me the damn prize!

18:26.189 --> 18:30.258
Finally, the Munion-shaped key
to Danuta's heart.

18:30.327 --> 18:31.792
Now, where is she?

18:33.930 --> 18:35.730
- Jurgen...
- Yep.

18:39.069 --> 18:43.404
Danuta!

18:43.406 --> 18:44.673
I'm sorry, Klaus.

18:44.741 --> 18:46.141
It's my fault.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.010
For bringing that wolf
Jurgen into the hen house.

18:49.079 --> 18:50.811
Players are gonna play,

18:50.813 --> 18:53.348
and I, of all people, should know that.

18:53.416 --> 18:54.549
Don't worry.

18:54.617 --> 18:55.950
There's somebody out there for everyone.

18:56.019 --> 18:58.086
You'll find yours some day.

18:59.622 --> 19:00.755
What are you doing?!

19:00.823 --> 19:02.823
I-I thought you were
putting out the vibe.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.292
Are you kidding me?

19:04.361 --> 19:05.370
No!

19:09.366 --> 19:10.732
I give up.

19:15.972 --> 19:18.039
Whoa! That was crazy!

19:18.108 --> 19:20.174
Why isn't anyone reacting to this?

19:20.243 --> 19:22.643
Because it doesn't concern me.

19:22.713 --> 19:24.779
I'm not <i>in</i> the Gravitron.

19:24.848 --> 19:28.849
I'm eating caramel corn,
having the time of my life.

19:28.851 --> 19:31.386
This is a carnival, after all.

19:31.454 --> 19:33.521
Try smiling, asshole!

19:33.590 --> 19:37.392
[BLEEP] you!

19:40.864 --> 19:42.597
- Aah!
- Ferryman!

19:42.665 --> 19:46.735
You save Steve.
I'll lead the sharks away.

19:49.472 --> 19:50.872
Betcha can't catch...

19:50.941 --> 19:52.006
Aah!

19:52.075 --> 19:53.674
Steve, we have to get out of here.

19:53.676 --> 19:57.078
No. I have to face those sharks
and prove I'm not afraid.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.414
No, you don't. It's okay to be afraid.

19:59.482 --> 20:00.949
Fear is what keeps us alive.

20:01.017 --> 20:03.418
But you're not afraid of anything.

20:03.486 --> 20:04.553
Yes, I am.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.555
I'm afraid of losing you.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.756
That and people finding out

20:07.824 --> 20:10.559
I can't pronounce the word
"dorktor's oyfoice."

20:10.627 --> 20:13.294
Are you trying to say "doctor's office"?

20:13.296 --> 20:15.253
God, it's so easy for <i> you!</i>

20:15.288 --> 20:18.366
Little help?
Anyone got an Oral-B floss pick?

20:19.052 --> 20:21.102
- Ow!
- We have to save Roger!

20:21.171 --> 20:23.237
No, Steve, listen to your fears.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.306
We have to save ourselves first.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.108
When Roger washes up on shore,

20:27.110 --> 20:28.909
we can take him to the emerghmancy rom.

20:28.911 --> 20:31.045
