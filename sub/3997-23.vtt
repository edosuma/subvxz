00:03.666 --> 00:05.621
- What is that? What are you doing?
- Oh, my goodness.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.613
- Oh, hey, guys, you have any hair you want removed?
- Hey.

00:07.637 --> 00:11.095
I must respectfully decline such a
horribly depressing invitation.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.695
Going on a date with
Elizabeth tonight.

00:12.732 --> 00:14.949
I haven't had sex with her since
I was fat and accessing my penis

00:14.962 --> 00:16.870
was like getting the remote
control out of the couch.

00:16.888 --> 00:17.940
Now I know things,

00:17.965 --> 00:19.597
and I own things.

00:20.389 --> 00:21.190
Like this.

00:21.202 --> 00:23.258
- What is that?
- Oh, my God, that poor girl.

00:23.276 --> 00:25.166
This is The Archduke.

00:25.196 --> 00:27.962
The crowning achievement of the
German institute of female pleasure.

00:27.974 --> 00:30.140
Dude, this thing takes
16 single-A batteries?

00:30.164 --> 00:32.317
I thought I threw that
thing out the window.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.469
That only made it stronger.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.515
Daisy called,
and we're going out tonight.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.894
Yeah, she
sounded pretty excited.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.805
I do believe
her exact words were,

00:40.866 --> 00:42.538
"this is your last chance."

00:42.748 --> 00:44.180
- So, I'm very confident.
- Yeah.

00:44.199 --> 00:45.390
Very confident.

00:45.414 --> 00:47.539
Schmidt, can you help me
with my phone? I have...

00:47.563 --> 00:50.391
Oh, you need help?
Where's your women's lib now?

00:50.665 --> 00:51.672
From Teddy:

00:51.697 --> 00:55.420
"In town tonight. Would love to
see you. 9:00 P.M. drinks?"

00:55.437 --> 00:56.943
- Oh, my God, Teddy.
- Oh, my God.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.303
- Hey, who's Teddy?
- Whoa, hey, man.

00:58.329 --> 01:00.122
- What are you doing...? Nick?
- Weird and gross.

01:00.139 --> 01:01.945
Sometimes I just sit in the
stall and listen to you guys.

01:01.964 --> 01:03.214
- Who's Teddy?
- Makes sense.

01:03.232 --> 01:05.260
What do you think he wants? You think
I should meet him for a drink?

01:05.283 --> 01:08.626
Am I the only one kind of dying to
know who this Teddy character is?

01:08.661 --> 01:11.426
- I think I speak for all of us...
- Nick, you and Jess didn't work out, okay?

01:11.465 --> 01:13.321
- No...
- www.moveon.org.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.830
Yeah, "ww" -- it's not
about that, just...

01:14.849 --> 01:16.093
- Chill out.
- Yeah, no. Thanks.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.540
Fine. Look. Um...

01:18.558 --> 01:20.946
I already regret this. Teddy...

01:21.517 --> 01:22.639
Teddy took my flower.

01:22.658 --> 01:24.177
- Wow, yeah, he did.
- What flower? - What?!

01:24.195 --> 01:25.914
Yeah, he stole a flower from you?

01:25.932 --> 01:27.928
And you want to have
drinks with him?

01:30.267 --> 01:32.024
- Oh, from your wonderful secret garden.
- Ugh.

01:32.030 --> 01:34.390
- Oh, my God.
- You guys do have to hear this story, though.

01:34.397 --> 01:36.772
- 'Cause it is the worst. It's the worst!
- No, no.

01:36.820 --> 01:37.645
- It's the worst.
- They...

01:37.664 --> 01:39.530
I guarantee you it's not
any more embarrassing

01:39.549 --> 01:41.769
- than the story of me losing my virginity.
- I promise you

01:41.806 --> 01:43.506
mine's worse than all of yours.

01:43.759 --> 01:45.479
Prom night. 2000.

01:45.497 --> 01:47.360
- What was the theme?
- Yeah, who cares about the theme?

01:47.379 --> 01:49.135
- What were you wearing?
- I want to know the theme.

- Damn it, Jess.

05:06.613 --> 05:08.368
Technically, why did we listen
to that whole story, then?

05:08.394 --> 05:10.658
- Technically, this guy's the worst.
- There was no sex.

05:10.713 --> 05:11.932

05:11.950 --> 05:13.777

where is the sex?

05:21.157 --> 05:22.170

05:22.182 --> 05:23.789
Cece, please go.
Tell your story

05:23.808 --> 05:25.508
of how your lost your virginity.
I need a palate cleanse.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.019
Actually, it was
the same night.

05:27.043 --> 05:29.155
It was prom night?
Really?

05:29.179 --> 05:29.982
Who was it with?

05:29.994 --> 05:32.307
Study hall Steve
or cool car Johnny?

05:32.338 --> 05:33.788
Oh, yeah.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.688
- Not exactly.
- Not them.

05:36.186 --> 05:38.172
So what? I'm a virgin.

05:42.392 --> 05:43.687
I don't want to plan it out.

05:43.705 --> 05:45.397
Whatever happens, happens.

05:45.665 --> 05:46.999
Oh, hello.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.939
I'd like to make love to you.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.802

- What?

05:52.992 --> 05:54.287
Game changer!

Freaking...

05:55.249 --> 05:57.518
Beatlemania!
Beatlemania!

05:59.063 --> 06:00.201
- Oh, my...
- The Beatles?!

06:00.225 --> 06:02.791
He was just on tour in Portland,
and we just started talking,

06:02.797 --> 06:04.380
and then we started laughing...

06:19.243 --> 06:20.699
What...
But I'm confused.

06:20.745 --> 06:22.901
Uh, Cece, that is not
an embarrassing story.

06:22.913 --> 06:24.245
Yeah, I know.

06:24.285 --> 06:25.835
- But I just love telling it.
- Yeah.

06:25.854 --> 06:28.680
Cece, you officially
move into last place.

06:28.705 --> 06:31.209
Boom. Moving up,
worst story.

06:31.238 --> 06:32.276
Jess,

06:32.338 --> 06:33.966
you have no chance of winning.

06:34.036 --> 06:35.888
It was my
junior year of college.

06:35.927 --> 06:37.461
I was about 200 pounds heavier.

06:37.523 --> 06:41.074
Freshman 50 plus sophomore
50 plus junior 100.

06:41.422 --> 06:43.174
I got some lubricant.

06:45.788 --> 06:47.537
It's to use on a woman.

06:47.555 --> 06:48.400
Uh...

06:48.431 --> 06:50.431
To increase her pleasure.

06:54.426 --> 06:55.969
Hey...

06:56.013 --> 06:57.951
Is it chill if I
have the room later?

06:58.313 --> 07:00.915
Elizabeth and I
have been talking, and...

07:01.771 --> 07:04.684
- We plan on merging tonight.
- Yeah, Schmidt!

07:04.703 --> 07:07.083
Penis, vagina.
Penis, vagina.

07:07.114 --> 07:08.652
The room's all yours, cowboy.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.306
Yeah, I got some,
uh, mushrooms,

07:10.311 --> 07:12.208
and I'm going to a
Dave Matthews concert later.

07:12.237 --> 07:13.149
I'm a Daver.

07:13.162 --> 07:14.736
<i>That sucks!</i>

07:14.748 --> 07:15.855
<i>White people.</i>

07:15.879 --> 07:19.146
Is this the first time
you'll be making... full love?

07:19.158 --> 07:21.062
No way, Jose.

07:21.111 --> 07:22.687
Look, Nick...

07:22.768 --> 07:26.012
Back in high school,
they used to call me...

07:26.747 --> 07:29.063
The sex... the sex hammer.

07:29.089 --> 07:30.408
- That's a great nickname.
- But, you know,

07:30.432 --> 07:31.892
now that we're
sitting here talking,

07:31.917 --> 07:34.531
would you mind having
a discussion, uh, openly

07:34.555 --> 07:36.749
about the subject
of intercourse?

07:37.017 --> 07:38.298
- Shoot.
- Cool.

07:38.317 --> 07:40.069
Hey, does it hurt for the guys?

07:40.112 --> 07:41.815
Not one bit.

07:42.193 --> 07:45.076
If I pee while it's happening,
will she die?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.994
How many minutes before sex
is it... is it okay to eat?

07:51.025 --> 07:52.770
I don't think
it's an exact science.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.729
I think it depends
on your frame.

07:55.109 --> 07:57.177
So, I should eat right before.

07:57.229 --> 07:58.892
In terms of lubricant,

07:58.917 --> 08:01.024
do I put a small
amount everywhere

08:01.037 --> 08:03.908
or do I use a large amount
in a small...

08:03.919 --> 08:05.191
In a smaller area?

08:13.816 --> 08:15.650
You're harshing my vibe,
Schmidt.

08:15.717 --> 08:16.984
You're the coolest, Nick.

08:17.252 --> 08:18.877
You know, so I'd already
taken the mushrooms.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.939
- Obviously.
- And I was ready to go to the concert,

08:20.976 --> 08:23.795
when I realized that the
troll at the end of my bed

08:23.817 --> 08:25.242
was pretty upset about it.

08:27.070 --> 08:30.847
I don't want any trouble. I think
you're a remarkable creature.

08:33.190 --> 08:34.488
No.

08:34.568 --> 08:36.403
Oh... I feel hot
in my pants.

08:37.942 --> 08:39.748
I still don't understand
why you didn't just leave.

08:39.772 --> 08:42.660
I've told you a million times,
my arm was a magnet

08:42.695 --> 08:44.402
and the walls were magnetic.

08:44.427 --> 08:46.156
What about that

I'm coming, Elizabeth!

10:09.575 --> 10:11.432
Look, when we were dating,
I was very limited

10:11.444 --> 10:12.860
as to what we could do sexually.

10:12.891 --> 10:16.119
It wasn't until the Iraqi war that I
realized a guy could even be on top.

10:16.152 --> 10:17.408
But that's all different now.

10:17.445 --> 10:18.701
Now I have The Archduke.

10:18.707 --> 10:21.214
Schmidt, have you ever
considered not using lube

10:21.234 --> 10:23.697
and some giant sex toy,
and just being with her?

10:23.709 --> 10:25.455
Plain Jane-ing it?
Yeah, okay.

10:25.474 --> 10:27.826
Well, I know for a fact
that I can't win this thing,

10:27.844 --> 10:29.839
because my story was...

10:29.966 --> 10:30.637
Beautiful.

10:30.743 --> 10:32.710
- Aw.
- No, your story was not beautiful.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.478
Nick's dad took us on a business
trip to New York, right?

10:35.509 --> 10:37.868
And he said that we could
do whatever we wanted.

10:38.893 --> 10:40.605
And we did.

10:43.145 --> 10:44.855
Oh, man.

10:45.466 --> 10:47.341
They're all on the <i>Titanic.</i>

10:47.360 --> 10:49.413
How does this movie end?

10:49.500 --> 10:51.094
I can't believe I never
seen it before, man.

10:51.106 --> 10:52.125
It's the best.

10:52.138 --> 10:53.475
You're mom's the best...

10:53.531 --> 10:54.712
At having boobs.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.656
- Shut up, stupid.
- I'm just kidding, man.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.372
- Don't. Don't.
- Hey.

11:00.528 --> 11:03.021
I didn't bring you two dummies
all the way to New York

11:03.046 --> 11:05.904
so you can park your cans
on the couch, watch TV

11:05.910 --> 11:07.251
and flick each other's bics.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.745
Hey, dad, last night,
somebody broke in

11:08.770 --> 11:10.762
and ordered a
pornographic movie,

11:10.781 --> 11:12.397
so there's a mistake
on the bill.

11:13.216 --> 11:15.416
Yeah, okay, you can tell
that to the marines.

11:15.434 --> 11:16.860
Meanwhile...

11:16.897 --> 11:18.897
I have a little
surprise for you boys.

11:18.924 --> 11:21.258
- Oh, cool.
- Ladies?

11:28.888 --> 11:30.844
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

11:30.863 --> 11:32.786
no, no, no, no, no.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.704
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

11:41.274 --> 11:45.123
Wait, what? You lost
your virginity to prostitutes?

11:45.141 --> 11:47.093
No, they were businesswomen.

11:47.171 --> 11:50.309
- Who could dance sexy.
- Winston, 100% they were prostitutes.

11:50.321 --> 11:51.234
Dude, no.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.853
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

11:52.926 --> 11:54.827
We work in the finance markets.

11:54.908 --> 11:57.339
We work in the finance markets?

11:57.788 --> 12:00.993
I'm Mysteria.
This is Octopussy.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.742
Your name's Octopussy?

12:02.810 --> 12:04.378
Absolutely.

12:04.439 --> 12:06.139
Thank you, guys, for coming.

12:06.182 --> 12:08.277
We're very wealthy.

12:10.209 --> 12:12.047
Winston, listen to their names.

12:12.060 --> 12:14.116
- They sound like pros.
- She was a nurse.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.877
Dude, her nurse hat
was in her purse.

12:15.895 --> 12:17.126
Would you listen to yourself?!

12:18.196 --> 12:20.197
Uh-huh.

12:21.244 --> 12:23.765
Honey, why are you
sweating so much?

12:23.943 --> 12:25.092
You should drink something.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.963
Thank you for the offer,
Ms. Octopussy,

12:26.975 --> 12:30.204
but I-I don't drink.
I prefer to be drunk on life.

12:31.068 --> 12:32.049
Hold that for me?

12:32.068 --> 12:33.786
- Sure.
- Thank you.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.581
Perhaps I'll try some.

12:40.592 --> 12:43.679
♪ So she told me to come over
and I took that trip ♪

12:43.698 --> 12:45.513
♪ and then she pulled out... ♪

12:45.557 --> 12:47.163
Very interesting.

12:47.270 --> 12:50.038
- Uh, uh, uh.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.144
I'm gonna do it to you.

12:52.288 --> 12:53.752
You're gonna do what to me?

12:53.787 --> 12:56.421
I don't know.

12:56.938 --> 12:58.257
Are you crying?

12:58.275 --> 13:00.138
Please, excuse me,

13:00.219 --> 13:03.517
but I had to lay off a lot of
really good men today at work.

13:03.679 --> 13:05.872
- What's wrong with your friend?
- He's a virgin.

13:05.891 --> 13:07.359
Aren't you a virgin, too?

13:07.384 --> 13:09.318
Just my penis, baby.

13:09.354 --> 13:11.693
Just my penis.

13:12.213 --> 13:14.847
<i>So Mysteria and
I made love that night.</i>

13:15.408 --> 13:18.226
For ten beautiful seconds.

13:19.297 --> 13:21.560
So, what do you do for a living?

13:22.211 --> 13:23.949
And it was good.

13:24.100 --> 13:27.363
Nick, I can't believe you lost
your virginity to Octopussy.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.811
I couldn't go through with it.

13:28.855 --> 13:30.524
It's 'cause the boy
had no game.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.537
He couldn't close.

13:31.555 --> 13:33.103
Okay, you don't need game.

13:33.121 --> 13:35.772
They were prostitutes.
My dad told me.

13:35.835 --> 13:37.448
Pop-Pop told you? When?

13:37.610 --> 13:39.007
Nicky, you here?

13:39.035 --> 13:40.698
Yeah, I'm here, dad.

13:41.148 --> 13:42.684
What are you doing?

13:47.342 --> 13:48.827
If I'm being totally honest,

13:48.850 --> 13:51.174
I've had some alcoholic
beverages tonight.

13:51.217 --> 13:54.147
Well, to be totally honest
with you, so have I.

13:54.294 --> 13:56.109
How do you think
I got through <i>Annie?</i>

13:56.146 --> 13:58.327
Geez, that was rough.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.823
- What happened here?
- I'm sorry, dad.

14:02.950 --> 14:05.809
I couldn't make love to
Ms. Octopussy tonight.

14:05.950 --> 14:08.698
It's too dangerous,
and I was afraid the FBI

14:08.710 --> 14:11.073
was gonna track me down
or a paper trail.

14:11.091 --> 14:12.592
You think too much.

14:12.617 --> 14:14.748
You think too much
about everything.

14:14.773 --> 14:18.926
When I was your age,
my dad got a girl for me, too.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.114
I mean, this is almost
a Miller family tradition.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.276
You should have seen her boobs.

14:24.487 --> 14:25.816
They were great.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.854
Real pointy,
just like I like 'em.

14:27.878 --> 14:29.191
Gross.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.512
Listen, Nicky,

14:33.773 --> 14:36.191
you don't have to do anything

14:36.520 --> 14:38.601
that you don't want to do.

14:38.793 --> 14:40.946
I just want to make sure
that you don't miss out

14:40.958 --> 14:42.894
on the things in life

14:42.929 --> 14:45.606
that are happening when
you're not thinking.

14:45.898 --> 14:47.996
Because, believe you me,

14:48.277 --> 14:49.621
those...

14:49.645 --> 14:51.645
Are the best things in life.

14:52.332 --> 14:53.957
I think I really like drinking.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.845
Well, that's great.
That's wonderful. That's good.

14:55.863 --> 14:57.462
- That's a great start.
- It's really fun.

14:57.499 --> 14:58.955
- It makes me feel good.
- Good.

15:00.455 --> 15:01.977
Uh...

15:02.922 --> 15:04.916
Don't tell Winston
about the girls.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.863
You know,
that they're... pros.

15:06.882 --> 15:09.345
- Yeah, I won't.
- I don't want to break his heart, you know?

15:09.370 --> 15:11.454
- Okay.
- I mean, you can tell him, but just...

15:11.485 --> 15:12.955
Wait, you know?

15:13.036 --> 15:14.461
Maybe after I'm gone.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.561
I'll tell him when you're dead.

15:16.761 --> 15:18.755
So it's time you should know.

15:18.777 --> 15:20.158
Mysteria...

15:20.184 --> 15:22.827
On the bright side, looks
like you won the contest.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.524
- Actually...
- Jess, look at him.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.237
- Let him have this.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Winston.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.905
I just can't let you win this.

15:27.936 --> 15:29.692
My story...

15:29.717 --> 15:31.430
Involves...

15:31.542 --> 15:32.776
Murder.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.562
Was Mysteria even
her real name?

15:40.408 --> 15:41.708
No.

15:43.355 --> 15:47.694
So I'd just moved to L.A. to be with
Cece, and we went out to some bar.

15:47.724 --> 15:49.756
- Do you remember where that was?
- No.

15:50.185 --> 15:52.580
How did I get this far
without having sex?

15:52.627 --> 15:55.193
In three years,
I'm gonna be 25.

15:55.218 --> 15:57.561
I can't rent my first
car as a virgin.

15:57.684 --> 15:58.883
They'll know.

15:58.928 --> 16:00.581
Okay. What about
those guys over there?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.091
- Mega beer!
- Party!

16:03.109 --> 16:04.752
- Pour beer at the same time.
- Yeah!

16:04.783 --> 16:06.321
They are definitely single.

16:06.381 --> 16:07.792
Yeah!

16:08.179 --> 16:10.352
I mean, kill me.

16:12.531 --> 16:13.593
Oh, my God.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.718
It was the guy from prom night.

16:15.737 --> 16:17.136
It was fate.

16:17.761 --> 16:19.755
Want to get out of here?

16:20.100 --> 16:22.200
Like, to do it?

16:22.512 --> 16:24.231
- Yeah. I'd be down with that.
- Yes.

16:24.267 --> 16:26.346
Um, but I'm kind of living
out of my car right now.

16:26.359 --> 16:27.603
- Damn it.
- Yeah.

16:27.628 --> 16:30.070
And I'm sleeping
on my friend's couch.

16:35.265 --> 16:37.123
Do you like DVDs?

16:39.785 --> 16:41.786
Do you sell cookies?

16:44.489 --> 16:46.324
Not a cookie bar.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.787
I have an idea.

16:53.475 --> 16:56.728
Hey, uh, I'm kind of on a lot
of antidepressants right now,

16:56.753 --> 16:58.597
so this may kind of
take a while.

16:58.628 --> 17:02.430
The only antidepressants
you need are in my pants.

17:02.716 --> 17:04.446
Uh, it's really
a medical issue.

17:04.478 --> 17:06.856
I'm so sorry.
That was really uncool.

17:06.868 --> 17:08.925
And... take as much
time as you need.

17:09.142 --> 17:11.376
So, two hours later...

17:11.406 --> 17:12.390
Still nothing.

17:12.407 --> 17:15.173
It was like a wind sock
on a windless day.

17:15.317 --> 17:17.571
Give me an update, brother.
How's your wang?

17:18.377 --> 17:19.502
Do you have, like, an...

17:19.521 --> 17:21.213
Is there, like, an
angle you could...

17:21.647 --> 17:22.886
Like... I mean...

17:22.904 --> 17:24.934
It's just... it's so much easier
when it's, like, in the shower,

17:24.952 --> 17:26.872
you know, and you're by
yourself and you don't...

17:26.895 --> 17:27.943
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

17:27.954 --> 17:29.991
- And there's no one with you.
- Well, what can I do to help? Listen,

17:30.010 --> 17:32.702
why don't we try our luck on the
other side of the castle, okay?

17:34.351 --> 17:35.730
Oh, my God!

17:36.648 --> 17:37.767
We're stuck.

17:37.838 --> 17:40.439
Hey, uh, don't
really know why, but...

17:41.550 --> 17:42.526
Ready now.

17:42.545 --> 17:44.514
<i>- Okay, getting worse.</i>
<i>- We were promised murder.</i>

17:44.532 --> 17:45.682
<i>She's not done.</i>

17:47.317 --> 17:48.423
Hey...

17:48.458 --> 17:50.991
Hey, kids. Could one of
you go get a grown-up?

17:50.997 --> 17:53.600
We're doing some grown-up
things over here.

17:54.030 --> 17:56.443
- Happy birth... Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

17:57.906 --> 18:00.340
Sir, um, we tried to make love

18:00.352 --> 18:04.001
on the bench, but, uh,
there was a man there.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.778
Oh, he's still there.
He must have been very tired.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.825
He slept through
all those sirens.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.893
- This man's dead.
- What?!

18:10.962 --> 18:14.237
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- I'm stuck!

18:14.353 --> 18:16.373
Officer, I...
It was very dark,

18:16.387 --> 18:18.050
and I did not see the knife.

18:18.068 --> 18:19.914
There's so much
death in the world.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.109
Seriously, dude, take your pills!
I'm sick of you.

18:22.128 --> 18:23.172
