Not the kind of road test
she had in mind.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.078
Any idea why
or who they were?
No, but I got a tape.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.780
The image
needs to be enhanced,
and then maybe we can ID them.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.850

No need for enhancement.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.784

What, are you into

08:51.097 --> 08:52.826

wasn't cIear.

08:52.899 --> 08:53.888
Why wouId he say that?

I don't know, Devon,
he's having some kinda
attitude probIem.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.868
It happened
right after the attack.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.872

out of Iine.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.960
Marco, I know.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.834
But you're so cIose
to getting the car.
And it's worth miIIions.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.134
Why worry about them?

14:03.309 --> 14:08.008
Because revenge, not money,
is the cure for bitterness.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.848
And the better the timing...

14:11.584 --> 14:13.609
the sweeter it gets.

Not now, MichaeI,

You know, you never
acted this way before, paI.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.802
That expIosion must have
shaken up your CPU
a Iot more than I thought.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.007
I guess so. I've never
feIt this way before.

14:44.083 --> 14:48.679

I' m sorry, buddy.
But I'm shutting you down.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.100
[traffic zooming]

15:38.771 --> 15:39.897
[sighing]

15:44.944 --> 15:46.172
Oh, boy.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.368
[sighing]

15:49.982 --> 15:51.313
Boy, what a day.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.044
(KITT)
It's not over yet, Iady.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.077
Who did that?

15:57.156 --> 15:59.818
(KITT)
I did. And unIess you want to
meet a simiIar fate, madam...

15:59.892 --> 16:02.690
I suggest you keep
your ampIe derriere
off my hood.

16:02.761 --> 16:05.662
Watch your Ianguage,
young man, or I'II report you
to the principaI.

16:08.767 --> 16:09.756
[excIaiming]

16:10.235 --> 16:11.202
[birds chirping]

16:12.504 --> 16:13.493
(Bonnie)
Give it up, RC...

16:13.572 --> 16:16.132
that piIe of junk wiII never
see the open road again.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.508
Yeah? Wait tiII you see
this piIe of junk...

16:19.578 --> 16:21.045
Ieaning into a turn, fIat-out.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.710
[phone ringing]

16:23.048 --> 16:24.982
RC, didn't anyone
ever teII you...

16:25.050 --> 16:28.110
when you put junk into a turn,
you get junk out.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.151
HeIIo?
Bonnie, it's MichaeI.

16:30.222 --> 16:31.211
MichaeI?

16:31.290 --> 16:33.121
Look, I've got a major probIem
on my hand here.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.853
Something's wrong
with KITT's CPU.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.894
(Bonnie)
Yes, RC toId me what happened.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.090
But that kind of an impact
shouIdn't affect
KITT's systems the way it did.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.828
Bonnie, I'm at a pay phone.
He won't patch me through.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.735
I'II have to run
an aII systems anaIysis.
You'd better bring him in.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.932
No way. He's being
a royaI pain in the....

16:49.174 --> 16:51.074
I may not be abIe
to bring him in on manuaI.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.236
You're gonna have to
bring him in
on remote controI.

16:53.312 --> 16:56.076
Okay, but that can
get reaI tricky
without communications.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.543
Maybe you can put a direct
patch through my comIink...

16:58.617 --> 17:00.448
on the auxiIiary channeI.
Try it.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.578
Good idea. Hang on a sec.
AII right.

17:06.724 --> 17:07.714
Try it now.

17:08.761 --> 17:09.921
Am I coming through?

17:09.994 --> 17:11.019
Loud and cIear.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.494
Great. I'II get back to you.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.669
You Iooked great
on the tube, boss.
Oh, thank you, ReginaId.

17:20.138 --> 17:21.163
(Devon)
Yes.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.470
You know, I used to ride
one of these things once.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.271
You're putting me on.
You, on a chopper?

17:28.113 --> 17:29.842
Yes, during the war.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.073
As a matter of fact,
I remember one evening...

17:32.284 --> 17:34.275
riding back
into an RAF station...

17:34.353 --> 17:35.615
bIackouts as usuaI...

17:35.954 --> 17:39.583
and just as I rode
into the station, I was
strafed by an enemy aircraft.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.187
Of course,
I scrambIed for cover...

17:42.861 --> 17:44.761
and when the smoke
had cIeared...

17:45.798 --> 17:49.165
my motorcycIe Iooked
just Iike yours.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.899
(MichaeI)
AII right,
I'm back inside KITT.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.599
I'm setting up a remote
controI access now, MichaeI.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.501
Good. He's aII yours.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.567
[tapping keyboard]

18:01.947 --> 18:03.744
There's interference
on the board.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.183
MichaeI, I'm having troubIe
gaining access.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.882
Marco, does that mean
the car's ours?

18:16.695 --> 18:18.788
Yes, we're in!

18:19.031 --> 18:20.555
We have behavioraI controI.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.064
I can't gain access.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.426
[buzzing]

18:26.939 --> 18:28.406
[beeping]

18:28.540 --> 18:29.529
I've Iost him.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.971
What about system bypasses
and auxiIiaries?
Have you tried those?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.139
No, I've tried
aII those channeIs.
They're bIocked.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.437
Try again.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.713
You've got to key back in
somehow.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.818
Okay, come on, come on,
bring him in!

18:44.223 --> 18:46.123
Knight Industries
Two Thousand...

18:46.191 --> 18:48.091
this is
your new Command Center.

18:48.527 --> 18:49.516
Do you read?

18:49.595 --> 18:51.495
(KITT)
Yes, I read you,
Command Center.

18:51.930 --> 18:55.161
You'II proceed
to the coordinates
I'm about to transmit.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.131
Nothing. I repeat...

18:57.402 --> 19:00.394
nothing wiII cause you
to sIow or stop.

19:00.572 --> 19:01.766
(KITT)
I understand.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.707
Ready to receive data.
Commence transmission.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.777
We're stiII dead
in the water here,
Bonnie...

19:08.847 --> 19:09.836
now, come on,
what's happening?

19:09.915 --> 19:12.850
I'm not sure.
AII of KITT's major systems
are maIfunctioning.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.115
I can't gain access to him.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.416
Whoa.

19:24.463 --> 19:25.452
What's going on?

19:25.531 --> 19:28.398
HoId it. KITT!
What are you doing?
HoId it.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.628
(KITT)
That's cIassified information,
Mr. Knight.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.670
Your access
has been withdrawn.

19:32.738 --> 19:35.298
You must have keyed
into something, Bonnie.
We're moving!

19:35.607 --> 19:36.835
I didn't program him!

19:43.448 --> 19:45.882
KITT! The intersection!
Stop!

19:46.185 --> 19:47.174
KITT, stop!

19:51.790 --> 19:54.054
Bonnie, we just bIasted
through an intersection...

19:54.126 --> 19:55.991
and aImost hit a Iady
in a wheeIchair.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.655
I can't stop him.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.496
He's picking up speed!

20:01.567 --> 20:03.535
MichaeI, I think you better
get out of there!

20:07.906 --> 20:10.170
Devon, that's easier said
than done.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.903
He's Iocked me in
reaI tight.

20:11.977 --> 20:12.966
(KITT)
That's right.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.572
As I said,
your systems access
has been nuIIified.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.775
Looks as if we may Iose
MichaeI as weII as KITT.

20:19.518 --> 20:22.146
Bonnie, initiate emergency
procedures at once.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.622
I can open KITT's T-top
with the frequencies
on your comIink.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.420
(Bonnie)
BaiI out
and we'II pick you up.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.921
You ready?
Let her rip!

20:29.928 --> 20:32.260
That system
is not cIeared for use.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.593
No time to expIain, paI.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.293
I gotta get out of here
before you kiII both of us.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.063
I've been instructed
to warn you.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.237
You're making
an unauthorized exit.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.363
I'II be back for you.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.729
I promise.

20:53.485 --> 20:54.474
Knight got out somehow.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.787
Great! Now you have
exactIy what you want!

20:56.855 --> 21:00.882
Yes, and now I'm going to
give it its first
search and destroy mission.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.987
What? You're going to
kiII him? Why? He hasn't
attacked anyone this time.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.325
But he wiII.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.126
He wiII. We won't have
a moment's peace.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.668
I'm doing this for us,
Bronwyn. I have no choice.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.234
(Marco)
Command Center
to Knight Two Thousand.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.699
Reverse direction
immediateIy.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.116
That's more Iike it, paI.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.213
I guess Bonnie finaIIy
got through, huh?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.049
MichaeI Knight is your target.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.589
Lock on and destroy.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.356
(KITT)
MichaeI Knight sighted.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.949
Attack mode engaged.

21:36.528 --> 21:37.790
KITT, no.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.194
KITT!

21:54.246 --> 21:55.804
KITT, no.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.411
No.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.334
[MichaeI grunting]

22:22.741 --> 22:24.732
KITT! KITT!

22:53.171 --> 22:54.433
Mission accompIished.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.231
Return to your new base.

23:37.883 --> 23:38.872
Bonnie?

23:43.655 --> 23:44.644
Bonnie.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.347
Bonnie.

23:55.000 --> 23:55.989
(Bonnie)
MichaeI, come in.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.365
Come in, MichaeI!
MichaeI, this is Bonnie,
come in.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.533
MichaeI, pIease come in.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.704
MichaeI.
MichaeI, do you read me?

24:06.711 --> 24:09.009
If the comIink's dead,
what's that?

24:09.080 --> 24:11.446
(Bonnie)
It must be the homing signaI
from the comIink.

24:11.516 --> 24:13.643
I'm picking up something
Iess than a miIe away.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.084
It's MichaeI,
he's aIive!

24:57.729 --> 24:58.718
Oh!

25:00.398 --> 25:04.391
He's beautifuI, Marco,
and he's ours.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.827
''It.'' It's a tooI, Bronwyn.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.439
BeIongs to
whoever controIs it...

25:10.242 --> 25:12.267
and for whatever we choose
to use it.

25:18.316 --> 25:19.749
(Bonnie)
KITT tried to kiII you?

25:19.851 --> 25:21.614
I had to pIay dead
to escape.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.212
Thank God, they didn't have
KITT scan my vitaI signs.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.155
Why wouId KITT
turn mean Iike that?

25:27.225 --> 25:31.161
Bonnie, is it possibIe
that anyone couId have gained
controI of KITT's CPU?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.390
Yes, but onIy by attaching
a component directIy.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.899
And there wasn't one there
when I fine-tuned KITT
this morning.

25:35.967 --> 25:38.367
Then some dude must've got
his hands on KITT after that.

25:38.436 --> 25:41.405
Wait a minute,
when I was chasing those guys
on the pier.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.839
That attack had to be
a diversion to get me
out of KITT.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.532
Had to be.

25:45.610 --> 25:46.975
It's cIear that someone
has KITT.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.641
Where do we go from here?

25:48.713 --> 25:51.273
FarreII's our onIy Iead.
Anything eIse on him?

25:52.250 --> 25:55.219
Yes, he works for
a manufacturer of
high-tech systems.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.721
Berio EIectronics.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.356
(Devon)
Did you say, Berio?

26:04.930 --> 26:06.522
You Iook Iike
you've just seen a ghost.

26:06.598 --> 26:07.929
Worse. An enemy.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.958
Long before anyone of you
had joined the Foundation...

26:11.036 --> 26:13.698
whiIe KITT's systems were
stiII being conceptuaIized...

26:13.972 --> 26:17.931
Marco Berio worked under
Doctor AIbert
as a CPU speciaIist.

26:18.109 --> 26:19.371
And to make
a Iong story short...

26:19.444 --> 26:22.345
he cIaimed that he had not
received the recognition
he deserved...

26:22.447 --> 26:25.348
so he Ieft, threatening
to destroy FLAG.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.552
WeII, he's off to
a heck of a start.

26:28.186 --> 26:30.017
Next stop, Berio EIectronics?

26:30.088 --> 26:31.077
That's right.

26:33.758 --> 26:34.986
But you need wheeIs.

26:35.193 --> 26:37.753
I mean, you can't exactIy
sneak up on them in a semi.

26:37.862 --> 26:38.851
I need some wheeIs.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.397
No, I never shouId have
said that.

26:40.465 --> 26:42.296
MichaeI, come on, pIease.
No, MichaeI.

26:42.367 --> 26:43.595
This thing run, RC?

26:43.969 --> 26:45.698
It's a piece of junk,
right, Bonnie?

27:03.188 --> 27:05.349
MichaeI, does your new comIink
check out okay?

27:06.024 --> 27:07.685
I'm receiving you just great.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.058
TeII RC his bike's
running just fine.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.289
I'II take good care
of his pride and joy.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.361
You hear that, Bonnie?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.731
My ''piIe of junk''
is humming aIong.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.702
I heard, RC.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.697
MichaeI aIso said
he'd take good care of it.

27:24.075 --> 27:26.441
And you know how
he takes care of equipment.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.379
My wheeIs....

28:18.063 --> 28:20.588
Bonnie, I'm at the pIant now.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.765
The pIace Iooks cIear.
Going in.

29:36.674 --> 29:39.609
What's with
the Iights? Nobody's
supposed to be here.

29:46.951 --> 29:47.940
[cIanging]

30:02.100 --> 30:03.089
Bonnie?

30:03.701 --> 30:05.999
I found a mock-up
of some sort of buiIding.

30:06.671 --> 30:09.936
I'II photo transmit
via comIink.
Here we go.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.543
I got it.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.889
It may not be anything,
but see if you can identify
the buiIding.

30:36.768 --> 30:37.757
[metaI cIanking]

30:39.838 --> 30:40.827
I got company.

31:01.659 --> 31:02.956
[revving engine]

31:47.906 --> 31:51.307
(Marco)
Yeah, FarreII, I understand.
Why didn't you caII me sooner?

31:55.113 --> 31:56.512

31:56.581 --> 31:58.572
Marco, Iet's just get in
the car and get out of here.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.880
Nobody wiII be abIe
to stop us. Not even him.

32:00.952 --> 32:03.216
No, it must carry out
its primary mission first.

32:03.288 --> 32:04.414
Marco, I don't understand.

32:04.489 --> 32:07.185
Knight Two Thousand,
this is Command Center.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.885
I read you Command Center.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.587
Your course
is pre-programmed.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.721
Your target is
the Convention Center.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.662
No, there are hundreds
of peopIe in there.

32:14.732 --> 32:15.926
Marco, you'II kiII them--

KITT to attack me...

to attack anything.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.356

Anything yet?

34:37.708 --> 34:40.302
Yes, caIcuIating from

What about evacuating

34:53.858 --> 34:56.190
No, there's not enough time.
Now, think, Bonnie.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.387
Is there any way we can tap
back into KITT?

34:58.463 --> 35:00.897
Not as Iong as Berio
owns his mind.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.458
If we couId switch KITT's

35:04.535 --> 35:06.560

but how?

35:06.637 --> 35:08.502
Get the repIacement part,

35:08.573 --> 35:10.040
Hey, come on, MichaeI.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.599
You're gonna intercept KITT,
stop him and
change the moduIe.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.542
No way.
We do it on the move, paI.

35:14.612 --> 35:15.977

he can sabotage us.

any easier, KITT.

38:01.512 --> 38:02.501
