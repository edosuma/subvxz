RAVI: I thought this
was Clive's case.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.687
S. CAVANAUGH: He has a connection
to a couple of the victims.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.613
All three victims
shot in the head.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.157
They were killed because
they were zombies.

Yeah?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.134
You got a minute?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.471
I came across
something strange

01:04.690 --> 01:06.977
as I was going through
the Tuttle-Reid case file.

01:07.526 --> 01:11.645
A registration form for a karate class
the kid, Wally, took a couple of years ago.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.984
For his
"in case of emergency,"

01:14.741 --> 01:15.777
he listed you.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.080
I said in my report that we used
to live in the same building.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.533
Yeah, I saw that.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.583
I was working undercover
in vice at that time

01:26.795 --> 01:27.956
and keeping weird hours.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.628
Sleeping a lot
during the day

01:29.840 --> 01:32.457
which led to a few
chance encounters.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.807
How about taking
your game outside?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.384
I'm not allowed
outside by myself.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.094
Then go play
in your apartment.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.349
I can't play in my apartment.

frames and trophies and stuff.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.100
Is that mustache real?

No, I glued it to give myself

01:52.529 --> 01:54.566

A kid you had a few
chance encounters with

There was hardly any blood
at the crime scene.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.402
Right, it's possible
the killer cleaned up.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.237
Or relocated the bodies.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.412
Hmm.

The missing fingernails...

03:30.502 --> 03:31.743

Kind of an ill-conceived

It just really hurts me when
someone hurts you, you know?

11:10.461 --> 11:15.081
You're like my
best friend ever. For real.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.251
Wait.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.339
We're totally
best friends, right?

11:28.479 --> 11:29.265
Yes.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.787

11:55.757 --> 11:57.544
I don't think
Miley Perry Gomez

11:57.759 --> 11:58.966
wants her fans going deaf.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.673
God, you are so embarrassing.
Stop trying to be funny.

12:01.888 --> 12:02.878
Lower the music, young man.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.178
- It's not even...
- Major...

12:04.390 --> 12:06.382
- But I'm just trying...
- Don't make me ask you again.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.012
Whatever. I'm turning it down.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.264
So, this is happening.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.015
It took me 20 minutes
to get out of the parking lot

12:11.231 --> 12:12.972
because Liv insisted
on checking my oil.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.901
Here it's been all selfies and
sour gummies, and Demi Lovato.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.731
How did you make
out at the bank?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.237
Oh, we came up empty.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.939
But this guy right here.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.947
You cannot believe how good
he is at interviewing people.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.744
We talked to all
of Stan's coworkers.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.288
Everybody loved him.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.161
What did they
say he was again?

12:31.376 --> 12:33.208
Enthusiastic and supportive.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.035
The memory on this guy.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.497
See, I know what's happening
right now with the brain

12:37.715 --> 12:38.796
but it still freaks me out.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.544
Well, If anyone can
get used to it, it's you.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.217
I guess I'll start
looking into his friends

12:42.428 --> 12:44.294
at Knights of Columbus
and his bowling league.

12:44.514 --> 12:45.630
Where you off to, kiddo?

12:46.975 --> 12:48.807
I have mercenary
training. God!

12:49.018 --> 12:50.384
Don't text and drive.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.060
Stop trying to control me.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.736
It's a lot different going
over the wall with your gear on.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.813
Your holster is gonna
snag on everything.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.529
Can I help you
with something, newbie?

13:06.744 --> 13:10.078
Your abs make me
want to kill myself.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.077
You're basically
carved out of marble

13:12.292 --> 13:14.955
and I'm just like this, like,
hideous blob of dead fat.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.003
I'm on teen girl brain.
I'm sorry.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.297
- You're not on the tubes?
- Tubes?

13:20.508 --> 13:21.419
We all get these.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.875
Bunch of brains
mashed together.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.131
No visions.
No crazy mood swings.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.132
Oh, thank God.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.094
I cannot stop taking selfies,

13:30.310 --> 13:33.769
and then I stare at them and
I just, I criticize myself.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.597
I mean look at this. Ugh.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.024
I look like ass
in every picture.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.187
Gross, right?

13:43.406 --> 13:44.817
We have to take this
to the authorities.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.071
What? We can't!
Winslow will never forgive me!

13:59.881 --> 14:02.214
I went through a list
of Cindy's classmates.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.543
She had four classes with a
girl named Winslow Sutcliffe.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.548
Winslow is the name you
heard in your vision, right?

14:07.764 --> 14:10.427
- Yeah.
- Look at you, having helpful visions.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.593
You have no idea
what was on Cindy's phone?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.643
Why she was worried
Winslow wouldn't forgive her?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.847
In the visions, the phone was
facing the wrong direction.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.807
Like this.
She was telling her dad.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.858
And he was all, "We have to
take this to the authorities."

14:22.070 --> 14:23.356
And she was all,
"You're ruining my life."

14:23.571 --> 14:24.982
And I was all,
"Why can't I just eat"

14:25.198 --> 14:26.314
"a Fillmore-Graves
brain tube thing,"

14:26.532 --> 14:28.148
"because visions
are super annoying."

14:28.368 --> 14:30.360
Whoa. What's a "Fillmore-Graves
brain tube thing?"

14:30.578 --> 14:32.490
It's like a yogurt tube
full of mashed-up brains.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.492
No personalities. No visions.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.118
I'm pretty psyched to try it.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.825
No, no, no, no.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.161
If they wanna eat brain mash,
let them eat brain mash.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.166
But in this house,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.293
we eat whole brains
and we solve murders.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.999
Can we get back
to the point here?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.504
If we want to know
what's on Cindy's phone,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.711
it seems like a pretty
easy problem to solve.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.512
Cindy didn't see
what was on the phone,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.555
but Stan did.
All we have to do is...

14:52.767 --> 14:54.349
"We have to take
this to the authorities!"

14:54.560 --> 14:56.051
- What the...
- Wait.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.557
The angle is probably wrong
because Cindy was shorter.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.020
"We have to take
this to the authorities."

15:02.235 --> 15:04.318
Great idea, champ.
But it's not working.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.485
Detective Babineaux.
I was summoned?

15:14.372 --> 15:16.534
I asked IT
to send me down a guy.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.206
I didn't use a Ouija board.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.660
I'm hoping you can get
something off of this for me.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.670
I have reason to believe
there's a photo on this phone

15:23.881 --> 15:25.543
that would be useful
on the Chens case.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.624
- That's a phone?
- I figured it was a long shot.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.881
You mind pulling up the
female victim's phone records

15:30.096 --> 15:31.303
and checking out
her social media?

15:31.514 --> 15:34.507
That is within the realm
of the possible.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.180
Hallelujah.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.845
A zombie mayor...

15:40.064 --> 15:42.181
The district attorney who drove
Mr. Boss out of the country

15:42.400 --> 15:44.687
and survived the basement
labs of Max Rager.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.731
I like our chances.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.232
I hope he doesn't
scratch any babies

15:48.448 --> 15:49.564
while he's out
working the trail.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.654
Gotta say, buddy. That's
more than a little offensive.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.235
Seems like
a reasonable concern.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.741
Sensitivity to our kind
will come with time.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.618
Any updates on
the Reid-Tuttle murder case?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.667
We were hoping to interview some of your
employees, people who knew the family.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.790
Of course. Detective
Cavanaugh was here yesterday,

16:04.005 --> 16:05.837
but people will
talk more freely to you.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.289
They know you're on our team.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.217
Can you think of anyone who might've
had a reason to harm the family?

16:10.428 --> 16:11.885
Yeah. Humans.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.304
Humans who want
to see us eradicated.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.847
Have you listened
to the radio lately?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.219
The Chuck Burd show?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.144
These morons calling in,

16:21.355 --> 16:22.687
talking about how they
wanna get their chance

16:22.899 --> 16:24.515
to shotgun some brain eaters.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.354
Bring it on is what I say.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.401
Feeling froggy, bubbas?
Let's get to hopping.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.692
My students can hear
their parents talking.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.241
Somehow it all gets
filtered back to them.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.410
They want to know when the
humans are coming to get them.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.158
Losing any of our kids
would've been tragic but...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.293
Losing Wally?
He was beloved.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.046
And Anna, she was
a teacher's aide.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.629
She loved
working with the kids.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.795
I got the sense that
Anna was finally happy.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.264
So, you maintained
a relationship with Anna

17:01.479 --> 17:03.015
while her husband was in jail?

17:04.065 --> 17:07.103
If by that you mean if I
helped her out occasionally...

17:08.653 --> 17:10.269
- Yeah.
- Helped her out, how?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.650
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

17:12.865 --> 17:14.401
(TV PLAYING)

17:17.662 --> 17:18.823
Hey, neighbor cop.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.154
I'm so sorry to bother you

17:20.373 --> 17:22.035
but my shift starts
in 20 minutes

17:22.250 --> 17:23.330
and my sitter just canceled

17:23.542 --> 17:25.204
and I know
this is a lot to ask,

17:25.419 --> 17:28.036
but is there any chance you
can fill in for me at the diner?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.042
Uh...

17:30.258 --> 17:31.419
Joking!

17:31.634 --> 17:33.626
But maybe Wally can hang out
at your place tonight?

17:33.844 --> 17:34.800
See what I did there?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.549
(SIGHS)

17:45.982 --> 17:47.723
Does the place
you work have pie?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.642
All kinds.
What's your pleasure?

17:50.528 --> 17:51.393
Surprise me.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.736
You're a life saver.
Come on, Wally.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.361
- Mr...
- Clive.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.450
You're gonna hang out
with Clive tonight.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.244
Please be good, okay?
Thank you.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.335
Um...

18:09.547 --> 18:11.379
You want to watch
a little TV or something?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.394
Hey, there.
Trade you a pie for a boy.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.726
Cool.

18:32.403 --> 18:33.894
Wally's asleep on the couch.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.992
- Did it go okay?
- Easy-peasy.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.320
<i>We've been binging Game of Thrones.</i>

18:43.539 --> 18:45.280
Well, Wally fell asleep
three episodes in.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.035
I'm a little too into it.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.660
I'm sorry,

18:49.879 --> 18:52.121
<i>you let a nine-year-old
watch Game of Thrones?</i>

18:54.216 --> 18:55.798
It was his suggestion.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.091
So?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.384
He said he was
allowed to watch it.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.712
And you believed him?

19:01.265 --> 19:04.383
You know, it did seem,
um, permissive.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.347
Every time there was nudity
or a beheading, I'd, like...

19:11.400 --> 19:12.356
Like...

19:15.321 --> 19:16.311
I am so sorry.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.024
Oh, you're screwing with me?

19:21.243 --> 19:24.532
(CHUCKLES) I'm not really mad,
if that's what you're asking.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.831
But in the future,
Wally suggesting something

19:28.042 --> 19:29.658
does not mean
it has been approved.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.162
In fact, it probably
means the opposite.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.418

19:41.639 --> 19:42.755
LIV: Thanks for coming in.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.469
You back with us?
You kind of spaced out.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.100
(EXHALES) No, I'm good.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.274
Everyone here
is so worried about

19:54.485 --> 19:55.646
what they're saying
on the radio,

19:55.861 --> 19:57.477
I thought maybe
I'd ask Ravi to listen

19:57.697 --> 19:59.063
to the latest
Chuck Burd shows.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.613
That's a good idea.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.409
I had a thought about our
interview with Cindy's friend

20:04.620 --> 20:07.283
but I'm not so sure this
one is a good idea at all.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.082
Murder?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.711
I thought it was an accident.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.755
Everyone at school
said it was a hit-and-run.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.175
The evidence suggests
there was intention.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.503
(SIGHS) Oh, my God.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.463
That second matchbook
should've done the trick.

Good to go.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.349
(LIV CLEARS THROAT)

We have reason to believe you

20:37.153 --> 20:39.145
What? I loved her to death.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.399
Is that so?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.822
Then why did you
unfriend her on Facebook,

20:43.033 --> 20:44.194
the night before
she was murdered?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.526
What?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.701
Zip it.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.203
You and Cindy exchanged
16 texts that night

20:49.415 --> 20:50.951
after which
you unfriended her.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.204
You mind my asking what those
16 texts were about?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.714
I was just upset.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.132
Cindy could
be super judgmental

21:01.343 --> 21:02.834
about everything I did.

21:03.053 --> 21:03.964
What was she
judging you about?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.547
I don't know. Just stuff.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.678
Where were you at 4:00 a.m.
the morning Cindy was killed?

21:09.977 --> 21:10.808
Sleeping?

21:12.396 --> 21:13.932
I quit ice skating last year

21:14.148 --> 21:15.889
because I couldn't take
getting up early all the time.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.145
So you knew the route
the Chens took to practice?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.397
Yeah. But...

21:21.280 --> 21:22.521
I don't even have
a driver's license.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.232
What exactly were
in those texts, Winslow?

21:25.576 --> 21:27.818
Your friend was dead just
hours after she sent them.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.905
- Surely...
- Oh, my God! Badger much?

her best friend was murdered.

Don't even.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.790
We have to take this
to the authorities.

21:42.009 --> 21:45.673
What? We can't.
Winslow will never forgive me.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.719
Anything you want to ask,
Miss Moore?

21:53.604 --> 21:56.938
Winslow, I know
being a teenager is hard.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.899
Been there, done that,
bought the T-shirt.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.476
You said Cindy was judgmental.

22:01.695 --> 22:05.484
Was it about your clothes,
or maybe about a guy?

22:05.699 --> 22:07.235
You can tell me anything.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.162
I gotta go.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.164
My stepdad is here
to pick me up.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.083
CLIVE: Thank you
for your help.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.094
That was standing back
and being quiet?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.676
I said, like,
maybe a sentence.

22:34.895 --> 22:35.931
God! It wasn't like...

22:36.522 --> 22:38.104
I saw what was
on Cindy's phone.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.932
It was a selfie Winslow took.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.892
She was in bed
with a shirtless man.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.978
The man appeared
to be in his 40s.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.233
- Ew.
- Yeah.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.814
And he just came
to pick her up.

22:48.033 --> 22:51.117
The shirtless man in the
pictures was Winslow's stepfather.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.072
I'm, like,
so grossed out right now.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.582
That's why Stan
wanted to go to the police.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.626
So, we gonna go
arrest him, or...

23:01.672 --> 23:03.334
What do we really have?

23:03.549 --> 23:05.711
I mean, your vision?
A photo of a sleeping man?

23:05.926 --> 23:07.087
I mean, in the photo,
did it look like

23:07.303 --> 23:08.760
she was there
against her will?

23:08.971 --> 23:11.054
She was making a kissy face
and giving a thumbs up.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.509
Consensual or not,

23:12.725 --> 23:15.433
if they're having sex,
it's statutory rape.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.802
That's something someone
might kill to cover up.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.763
We need to see what else
is on Winslow's phone.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.974
I'll to try to find a judge
who'll give us a warrant.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.274
You okay, buddy?

23:28.908 --> 23:31.150
I know this must all be
pretty confusing for you.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.779
Oh, my God. Don't even.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.284
Where are you going?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.531
Do you need any money?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.036
Winslow's mother
owns this place

23:43.255 --> 23:44.917
but the stepfather runs it.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.668
Should I be the first
to point out

23:46.884 --> 23:48.967
that a cradle robber
works at a nursery?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.386
You know Sutcliffe Park,
Sutcliffe Marina,

23:51.597 --> 23:53.259
- Sutcliffe Boulevard?
- Yeah.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.636
All named for
Winslow's family.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.716
A couple of years ago,

23:56.936 --> 23:58.643
Winslow's mother leaves
her stockbroker husband

23:58.854 --> 24:00.436
and runs off
with their landscaper,

24:00.648 --> 24:02.640
marries him,
and buys him this business.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.894
He takes her name.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.600
And then he
takes her daughter.

24:05.819 --> 24:06.980
Scandalous.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.607
Well, look what we have here.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.948
- No signs of damage.
- Shoot.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.836
LIV: There he is.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.585
Mr. Sutcliffe,

24:31.804 --> 24:33.511
Detective Babineaux.
Seattle PD.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.133
My associate Olivia Moore.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.719
Is Winslow around?

24:37.559 --> 24:39.050
My wife is picking her up
from school.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.802
Everything okay?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.933
That flatbed truck out front,
who drives it?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.764
I do. Why?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.771
Does Winslow
have access to it?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.352
She doesn't have
her driver's license.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.686
And a truck like that
with a stick shift,

24:49.905 --> 24:51.066
I doubt she'll ever drive one.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.193
Can you tell me how well
you knew Stan and Cindy Chen?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.241
I knew 'em a fair bit.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.035
Cindy and Winslow
were like soul-sisters.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.738
And Stan I used to see
at skating practice

24:59.957 --> 25:00.868
before Winslow gave it up.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.699
Where were you
on Monday at 4:00 a.m.?

25:03.794 --> 25:05.456
He was in bed sleeping.

25:05.671 --> 25:06.832
Next to me.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.913
I'm Tori, Ken's wife.
What is this all about?

25:09.133 --> 25:11.295
We're investigating the murder
of Stan and Cindy Chen.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.876
And right now
we're checking alibis.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.007
Why on Earth
would Ken need an alibi?

25:15.889 --> 25:17.721
Just covering our bases.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.549
Winslow came home in tears

25:19.768 --> 25:21.384
after you questioned her
yesterday.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.767
- She's a good girl, Detective.
- No one's saying she's not,

25:25.065 --> 25:27.057
but the Chen's car was crushed
by a large truck,

25:27.276 --> 25:28.517
like the one outside.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.568
And we know your daughter
and Cindy were having a fight.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.986
You really think I...

25:32.197 --> 25:34.780
We have a warrant...

25:36.285 --> 25:37.241
for Winslow's phone.

25:40.748 --> 25:41.704
But it's my phone.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.082
Hand the detective
your phone, Winslow.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.159
Mom!

25:46.378 --> 25:49.337
Hand it over.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.771
Did you fix the wheels
on my rolly chair?

26:11.987 --> 26:14.104
I just replaced the casters.
Gave them a shot of oil.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.279
Oh.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.649
I, uh...

26:18.452 --> 26:19.568
I think I have
a new understanding

26:19.787 --> 26:21.744
of what it must be like
to not be able to control

26:21.955 --> 26:23.787
what goes on
inside your own head.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.410
Something on your mind, sport?

26:28.879 --> 26:31.872
I can't stop thinking
about Peyton and Blaine.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.957
And it's driving me crazy.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.968
I've been avoiding Peyton
because I'm fairly certain

26:37.179 --> 26:39.546
I'm gonna behave badly
and blow everything up.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.760
You want to know what I think?

26:43.560 --> 26:44.550
Maybe.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.978
I think you should give
yourself a little more credit.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.475
If you were gonna
fly off the handle,

26:48.690 --> 26:49.646
you would've done so.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.065
But you didn't.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.983
Because you're better
than that.

26:53.529 --> 26:56.317
- I'm not sure that's true.
- You are.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.694
Even if you don't see it.
I do.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.323
The best thing you can do
for yourself and for Peyton

27:02.538 --> 27:03.619
is be honest.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.700
Be direct.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.532
And be Ravi.

27:07.751 --> 27:11.290
Because Ravi
is a pretty cool guy.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.376
Thanks, Dad Brain.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.132
You find anything on those
old Chuck Burd shows?

27:20.347 --> 27:21.258
Not yet.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.180
Well, get back to work.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.975
There's a crisp five dollar
bill in it for you if you do.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.894
Oh! The smoke detector
batteries probably need a change.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.062
On it.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.893
- Guess what I just found out?
- What?

27:35.112 --> 27:36.944
I just found out
that our girl Winslow

27:37.156 --> 27:39.523
received this citation
for driving without a license

27:39.741 --> 27:41.152
a couple months ago.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.532
She was in a Fiesta hatchback.
With a stick shift.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.159
"Good girl" my Aunt Fanny.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.248
I realize that, Your Honor.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.173
We know there's not enough
for a murder charge.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.546
We're just looking for a way

27:59.761 --> 28:01.753
to get the minor away
from her abuser.

28:01.972 --> 28:05.136
I've just seen
these things end ugly.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.013
I understand.

28:09.104 --> 28:09.935
Thanks for your time.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.783
Do the ninja chop thing.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.868
They're supposed to be cubed.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.619
Come on.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.374
(EXCLAIMS)

28:39.426 --> 28:41.418
(EXCLAIMING)

28:45.766 --> 28:46.802
Let me try.

28:49.102 --> 28:53.187
Anna, do you let Wally play
with big, sharp chef knives?

28:53.398 --> 28:54.434
Rarely.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.311
Nice. You're getting it.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.859
You, go get washed up.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.605
You went to the semolina lady?

29:02.824 --> 29:06.067
Got some creste di gallo.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.533
And the last bottle
of that olive oil you like.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.660
The sun-dried tomato crack?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.616
Well done, you.

29:13.835 --> 29:14.746
(GLASS CLINKS)

29:18.423 --> 29:19.959
I skyped with my brother
Caleb today.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.461
He's coming back
from overseas.

29:21.677 --> 29:22.713
He looked thin.

29:22.928 --> 29:23.793
He'll be back
in a couple weeks

29:24.012 --> 29:26.925
and I told him I'd try to
get you to make your paella.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.301
That's great.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.643
I think I might take Wally

29:32.854 --> 29:34.971
and go stay with Caleb
when he gets back.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.188
Yeah?

29:40.779 --> 29:43.487
A restraining order's
just a piece of paper.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.237
I'm afraid this is gonna be
Rick's first stop when he gets out.

29:46.868 --> 29:47.858
Anna...

29:49.788 --> 29:51.074
I'm right next door.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.789
You've already done
so much for us.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.910
I never want it to seem like
I take you for granted.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.119
Hey...

30:00.257 --> 30:01.668
Take me for granted.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.884
Get it over with already.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.885
(GIGGLES)

30:17.274 --> 30:17.980
Detective.

30:18.734 --> 30:19.815
Mrs. Sutcliffe.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.729
I'm sorry. I was just
a little, um, spaced out.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.651
My husband killed
Stan and Cindy Chen.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.702
My daughter confessed
to me last night that

30:37.127 --> 30:38.334
she's been having...

30:39.838 --> 30:42.080
Relations with my husband.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.414
Her stepfather.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.592
Consensual, though
as she now knows, illegal.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.379
After you came to see us
yesterday, Ken took off.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.925
Took off?

30:51.141 --> 30:54.009
He packed his things,
stole some of my money,

30:54.227 --> 30:57.015
and left without telling us
where he's going.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.063
His phone goes
straight to voicemail.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.733
What motivation would your husband
have for killing Cindy and Stan?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.149
Winslow.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.410
About a week ago
Ken broke things off.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.365
I hadn't told anyone
about us, but...

31:16.583 --> 31:19.576
I was so upset,
and Cindy could see it.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.832
I needed someone to talk to.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.122
So I told her.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.173
That's what Cindy
was judgmental about?

31:26.385 --> 31:27.375
The affair?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.131
Cindy told her dad,

31:30.347 --> 31:31.679
and they were gonna go
to the police.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.675
That's why I unfriended her.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.761
When I came into work after
Stan and Cindy had been killed,

31:38.980 --> 31:42.644
I noticed that Ken had taken
the bush bumpers off the truck.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.942
I didn't think anything of it
at the time, but now,

31:45.153 --> 31:46.769
I think he was
hiding evidence.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.149
Bush bumpers?

31:48.365 --> 31:50.152
They mount on the front
of a truck bumper.

31:50.367 --> 31:51.483
Off-roaders use them.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.658
Our work
requires them sometimes.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.327
Winslow, how did Ken know

31:55.539 --> 31:58.156
that Stan and Cindy planned
on going to the police?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.492
I didn't tell him.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.621
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

32:04.798 --> 32:06.255
Excuse us for a moment.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.594
So those missing texts?
It's what I expected.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.971
The reference pointer
was just remapped to null.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.394
So I bytemapped an image
of the OS footprint,

32:20.605 --> 32:21.891
loaded up a hex editor,

32:22.107 --> 32:24.099
and did some educated
regex grepping, and...

32:24.317 --> 32:25.774
English, please.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.273
The girl destroyed her texts.
But I...

32:29.865 --> 32:31.572
Resurrected them.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.447
Therein lies the last exchange
between the two adolescents.

32:35.662 --> 32:39.372
Take heed
of Winslow's final text.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.248
You ever been to Perversion?

32:48.550 --> 32:50.007
It's on 9th.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.754
- I think you'd really...
- Got it.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.137
"You, expletive, expletive."

32:55.348 --> 32:56.964
"I can't believe
you told your dad."

32:57.184 --> 32:59.767
"If he goes to
the, expletive, police..."

33:00.729 --> 33:02.095
"You're, expletive, dead."

33:02.314 --> 33:03.270
"Winslow."

33:04.191 --> 33:06.057
Winslow knew Stan
was going to the police.

33:08.487 --> 33:12.071
The only way Ken would have had that
information is if Winslow had told him.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.490
That's not necessarily true.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.244
TORI: That took a while.

33:20.582 --> 33:23.620
Sorry. There are a lot
of moving parts in this case,

33:23.835 --> 33:26.578
but I think they're
starting to finally line up.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.287
There are things we know
in the case.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.215
The killer knew the route
to the ice skating practice.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.088
The killer needed access
to a big truck.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.634
Ken fits the bill, doesn't he?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.053
The killer also had to know

33:36.264 --> 33:38.972
that Stan Chen planned on
going to the authorities.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.058
So, how would
the killer know that?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.681
Winslow says
she didn't tell him.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.522
Winslow, our technology expert

33:46.733 --> 33:48.690
found an app on your phone
called Tinker Spy.

33:48.902 --> 33:51.315
- I don't know what that is.
- It's an app marketed to parents.

33:51.530 --> 33:55.114
It's installed secretly on their
kid's phones to keep tabs on them.

33:55.325 --> 33:56.736
It works on
a monthly subscription.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.159
Anything you do on your phone,

33:58.370 --> 34:01.113
all calls, all texts,
they get recorded

34:01.623 --> 34:03.330
and passed along
to the subscriber.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.328
Ken was spying on me?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.206
There is a phone number associated
with the credit card used

34:07.420 --> 34:08.786
for the Tinker Spy
subscription.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.588
My colleague
is calling it now.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.790
(LINE RINGING)

34:13.009 --> 34:14.966
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

34:21.935 --> 34:22.925
You?

34:24.353 --> 34:27.938
What you did was disgusting.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.937
You seduced my husband,

34:31.152 --> 34:33.643
and the whole world
was gonna know.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.650
We would've
both been disinherited.

34:35.864 --> 34:38.949
You stupid, selfish girl.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.991
Well, the whole world is
certainly going to know now.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.293
Tori Sutcliffe,
you are under arrest

34:54.509 --> 34:56.922
for the murders of Stanley
and Cindy Chen.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.809
Winslow is going to be staying with
an aunt on Vashon Island for a while.

35:09.024 --> 35:12.017
I'll put an APB out on Ken
for the sexual assault.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.521
He's gonna have
a hell of a head start.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.854
Amateurs like this guy
always screw up.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.031
He'll use a cell phone or a
credit card and we'll nab him.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.946
I just sent you a link to a
clip from the Chuck Burd show.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.028
I've finally heard something
I think may be relevant.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.123
CLIVE: Let's see. Here it is.

35:28.752 --> 35:29.959
<i>CALLER: Straight up, Chuck.</i>

35:30.170 --> 35:31.786
<i>My dog was digging
in the neighbor's trash,</i>

35:31.963 --> 35:34.046
<i>and when I was cleaning up,
I found brains in there.</i>

35:34.257 --> 35:35.543
<i>They were in these tubes,</i>

35:35.759 --> 35:37.341
<i>kind of like those squeezy
yogurt things.</i>

35:37.552 --> 35:39.168
I would've thought it was
just another crazy person,

35:39.387 --> 35:41.879
but Major said they eat brains
from tubes at Fillmore-Graves.

35:42.098 --> 35:44.556
I'll call the radio station.
They keep records of the callers.

35:44.768 --> 35:45.884
I'll let you know
when I have something.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.811
Thanks for the help
on the case.

35:50.023 --> 35:52.185
I believe there was mention
of a crisp five dollar bill.

35:53.443 --> 35:54.854
Ah. A man of her word.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.686
Wanna grab a coffee?
I'm buying.

35:56.905 --> 35:57.861
Sure.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.194
Did you decide
what to do about Peyton?

36:01.951 --> 36:04.910
I'm gonna call her.
Try to talk things out.

36:05.121 --> 36:05.986
Attaboy.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.367
Hold up.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.996
(SIGHS) I got an address
for that caller.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.244
You okay, Clive?

36:14.130 --> 36:16.964
Turns out he lived next door
to Wally, Anna and Caleb.

36:17.926 --> 36:18.882
Let's go.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.050
<i>MAN: (OVER SPEAKER) Who is it?</i>

36:24.933 --> 36:25.923
<i>Mr. Huntsman.</i>

36:26.601 --> 36:27.762
Seattle PD.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.184
<i>We have a few questions
about the murders</i>

36:29.396 --> 36:30.557
<i>that happened next door.</i>

36:30.772 --> 36:32.434
<i>I already talked
to the police.</i>

36:32.649 --> 36:34.561
<i>Yeah, you know how in movies
and on TV shows</i>

36:34.776 --> 36:36.938
<i>the police come back sometimes
with follow-up questions?</i>

36:37.153 --> 36:38.689
<i>That's what's happening now.</i>

36:46.746 --> 36:47.907
Can I see that badge again?

36:51.334 --> 36:53.451
Photographic memory,
Detective Babineaux.

36:54.504 --> 36:56.837
Can you tell me what kind of
relationship you had with your neighbors?

36:57.048 --> 37:00.132
Mmm-hmm. The non-existent
kind. I keep to myself.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.505
Did you hear that your neighbors
were all shot in the head?

37:02.721 --> 37:04.303
He's asking because
if you were to believe

37:04.514 --> 37:05.630
you lived next door
to zombies,

37:05.849 --> 37:07.260
you might choose
to fix that problem

37:07.475 --> 37:08.841
by shooting your neighbors
in the head.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.518
And from the recordings we
have of the Chuck Burd show,

37:11.730 --> 37:14.143
it sure sounds like you believed
you had a zombie problem.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.648
Where were you that night,
Mr. Huntsman?

37:16.860 --> 37:20.399
(CHUCKLES) No, you don't.
Okay? I won't be your patsy.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.104
First, I was in Portland
at my sister's wedding.

37:22.323 --> 37:23.814
Second, I'm not
the only one who knew

37:24.033 --> 37:25.399
I had brain eaters
living next door.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.068
And who else might've known?

37:31.541 --> 37:32.247
See?

37:33.376 --> 37:34.412
What am I looking at?

37:35.211 --> 37:36.372
Message board.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.462
- For whom?
- People who get it.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.460
Get that the government
experiments on its citizenry,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.291
unleashes monsters.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.876
And that's what happened
at Max Rager.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.927
Posted the same
information here

37:46.139 --> 37:48.722
that I gave on Chuck's show.

37:48.933 --> 37:49.889
Look at the responses.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.635
"Stockpile your ammo..."

37:52.854 --> 37:54.345
"Aim for the head."

37:55.815 --> 37:57.147
"Zombies live here."

37:59.527 --> 38:00.483
LIV: That's Wally's home.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.936
I never gave my address.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.487
Somebody must've hacked
my profile and found it.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.315
Everyone on this
message board,

38:06.534 --> 38:07.615
a few hundred people,

38:07.827 --> 38:09.910
knew I had brain eaters
living next door.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.542
I'd love to see some photos
from your sister's wedding.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.327
You got any of those?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.086
Anyone who visited
this message board

38:23.301 --> 38:25.258
had access to Caleb
and Anna's address.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.506
And the neighbor?

38:26.721 --> 38:27.882
His alibi checks out.

38:28.097 --> 38:31.010
"If you know where other
zombies live, post it here."

38:34.145 --> 38:35.261
They're hunting us.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.565
Twenty-one months and 21 days.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.985
- Until what?
- Since what?

38:43.696 --> 38:45.608
When this all began,
we hypothesized

38:45.824 --> 38:47.690
we had roughly three years

38:47.909 --> 38:50.401
before the civilian population
learned our secret.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.328
Looks like we gave ourselves
too much credit.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.873
It's been 21 months
and 21 days

38:56.084 --> 38:58.701
since the 4th of July retreat
when everyone was turned.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.454
I wonder if anyone had that
in the office pool.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.789
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

39:03.216 --> 39:04.127
Babineaux.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.134
Text me the address
and I'll be right there.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.881
Ken used his credit card
at a gas station in Tacoma.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.682
I'm gonna pick him up
and bring him in.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.885
- You good here?
- Yeah.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.234
Sexual assault?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.325
Strange collar
for a homicide detective.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.871
It's the most normal thing
that happened to me in weeks.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.198
MAN: Hey, buddy.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.533
Your guy.

39:38.751 --> 39:39.491
MAN: Come on back here.
What are you doing?

39:39.711 --> 39:40.622
Hey!

39:41.254 --> 39:43.416
Where do you think
you're going? Get over here!

39:43.631 --> 39:44.792
Can I get some help here?

39:45.008 --> 39:46.294
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.875
Yeah. I got him. I got him.

39:48.678 --> 39:49.964
Get him out of my sight!

39:50.179 --> 39:52.762
Come on, move. Move!

40:00.398 --> 40:01.855
Just the guy
I was looking for.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.682
Yeah?

40:03.902 --> 40:04.858
You got a minute?

40:07.780 --> 40:10.113
So, when was the last time
you saw Wally and Anna?

40:11.200 --> 40:14.034
Things escalated on the case
I was working undercover.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.987
Wound up being in too deep
to come up for air

40:17.206 --> 40:19.573
for the two weeks
leading up to Rick's release.

40:21.502 --> 40:25.212
When I finally got back,
Anna and Wally were gone.

40:25.882 --> 40:26.542
They'd moved out.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.839
And that's the last
you ever heard of them?

40:29.886 --> 40:31.969
I got a letter from Anna
some time later,

40:32.180 --> 40:33.887
saying that she was
living with her brother

40:34.098 --> 40:35.384
and starting a new life.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.016
She didn't want
to stay in touch.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.805
The ex-husband was out
for five days

40:43.024 --> 40:45.687
before he got busted
for assaulting his PO.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.188
He's been locked up
ever since,

40:47.403 --> 40:49.440
so he didn't kill them.

40:49.948 --> 40:50.688
I know.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.440
We done here?

40:55.203 --> 40:56.239
Sure.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.405
So, that letter...

41:00.792 --> 41:03.284
- What?
- The letter.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.619
When did you get it?

41:07.548 --> 41:08.880
Twenty-two months ago.

41:11.928 --> 41:14.716
You ever think how differently
things might've turned out

41:14.931 --> 41:17.048
if you'd have been around
when her ex got out?

41:20.603 --> 41:21.810
Once or twice.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.525
(SIGHS)
