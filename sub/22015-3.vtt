00:01.302 --> 00:01.402
.

00:01.435 --> 00:02.336
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.537 --> 00:05.239
sexually based offenses

00:05.273 --> 00:07.108
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.442
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.476 --> 00:10.244
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.278 --> 00:12.046
are members of an elite squad

00:12.080 --> 00:14.115
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.583
These are their stories.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.485
[dramatic music]

00:17.518 --> 00:20.388
- So I'm eight years old.
I go to the store with my mom.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.823
- Now, while she's paying,
I end up boosting

00:22.856 --> 00:24.325
some, uh--some Rolos.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.160
- When I was that age,
I was all about Jujubes.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.062
- So what am I gonna do, right?

00:28.096 --> 00:30.531
We get outside, pull the Rolos
out of my BVDs.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.133
She busts me.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.234
She makes me go back
into the store.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.802
I got to cop to everything.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.837
I cried--
I cried like a little baby,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.406
and then I had to do it
all over again on Sunday

00:38.439 --> 00:41.142
at confession,
but bless her heart,

00:41.175 --> 00:42.810
she never did tell my old man.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.846
- My pops would've backhanded
me if I did something stupid.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.582
I stayed out of trouble
mostly out of fear.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.184
What we got?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.153
- We caught a job
off a 911 call.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.155
People screaming in room 240.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.190
When we got up here,
nobody answered the door.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.192
Security let us in.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.301
- We got a bloody steak knife
in the sink here.

01:07.335 --> 01:10.171
- It is nasty,
but why call SVU?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.173
- Take a look
in that ice bucket.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.577
- Aw! Come on.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.580
- If I'm not mistaken,
that's a set of testicles.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.648
- Aw, jeez.
- Confirmed.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.882
You found these on ice?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.117
- They were on the bed.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.318
I put 'em in there.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.254
- Good thinking.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.189
[flashlight clicks on]

01:28.889 --> 01:31.492
Hey, Carisi, check this out.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.495
[suspenseful music]

01:34.528 --> 01:42.102
*

01:46.574 --> 01:48.442
- He's still alive.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.516
[dramatic music]

02:38.692 --> 02:38.826
.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.627
- Jason Karr,
the unfortunate recipient

02:40.894 --> 02:42.730
of an amateur gonadectomy.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.499
- Okay. Patrol said that they
recovered the missing parts

02:45.533 --> 02:46.734
and brought them here?

02:46.767 --> 02:48.436
- Once the spermatic cord
is severed,

02:48.469 --> 02:49.837
the testicles are
just medical waste.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.773
Good news is he'll be okay
with some plastic surgery,

02:52.806 --> 02:54.642
prosthetics,
hormone replacement therapy.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.909
- Depends what you mean
by okay.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
- Yeah. Any defensive wounds?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.913
- None, but his tox screen
showed a high level

02:59.947 --> 03:03.517
of alprazolam,
and his BAC was 0.19.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.519
Lucky for Mr. Karr,
he was thoroughly zonked

03:05.553 --> 03:06.787
when he gave up
the family jewels.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.389
- And how soon
can we talk to him?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.523
- Once his anesthesia
wears off,

03:09.557 --> 03:10.658
we'll move him to the ICU.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.792
[phone buzzing]
- Okay.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.793
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.663
- Benson. Oh, hi.

03:15.696 --> 03:21.435
Thank you so very much.
That is--that is great news.

03:21.469 --> 03:24.805
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you very much.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.407
The DA cleared me.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.242
They are closing
the investigation

03:28.276 --> 03:30.478
of Noah's bruises.
[exhales deeply]

03:30.511 --> 03:32.913
- Liv, I'm so sorry
you had to go through that.

03:32.946 --> 03:33.947
- [softly] Yeah, well...

03:33.981 --> 03:36.484
happy ending at least.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.985
[dramatic music]

03:38.018 --> 03:40.954
- I called 911 a few minutes
after I left the hotel.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.690
- Why were you there?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.991
- I was visiting a friend
who was staying there.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.826
As I was going to the elevator,

03:45.859 --> 03:47.761
I heard people screaming
at each other in room 240.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.530
A man and a woman.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.831
- Did you hear what they were
saying, Ms. Galen?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.734
- Nora. Not really.
It was mostly profanity.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.570
- So why not knock on the door,
see if anyone needed help?

03:56.604 --> 03:57.905
- Well, it was none of
my business, really.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.973
But as soon as I left,
I started to feel guilty

04:00.007 --> 04:01.041
I didn't do anything.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.843
I hope everybody's okay.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.546
- Let's just say it's
a good thing you called us.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.716
[knocking on door]

04:08.749 --> 04:09.850
Julie Wade?

04:09.883 --> 04:11.485
- That's right.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.487
- Detective Tutuola
and Detective Carisi,

04:13.521 --> 04:14.855
from SVU in the city.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.657
- Oh, hi.
What's going on?

04:16.690 --> 04:19.059
- We're investigating
an incident that happened

04:19.092 --> 04:20.761
in Manhattan last night.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.730
- Manhattan?
- Yeah, you made a reservation

04:22.763 --> 04:24.598
at the Midtown Skyline Hotel.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.834
Checked in around 6:30
in the evening?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.636
- No, there must be
some mistake.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.070
I was here with my boyfriend.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.873
- Well, it was booked
under your VISA card.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.508
- Hold on a second.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.611
- Julie!
Where the hell are you?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.513
Who are these mopes?
- Police officers.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.981
Something about one
of my credit cards.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.716
- Well, get rid of 'em
and make me something to eat.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.918
I'm gonna be late.
- Sure, babe.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.892
- Oh, my God!
My card is gone.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.727
- Okay, well, when was
the last time you saw it?

04:53.761 --> 04:56.830
- I remember using it
at Costco on Monday.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.966
I must've left it there.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.568
- Know this guy?

05:00.601 --> 05:01.769
- No.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.671
Why?
Did something happen to him?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.707
- That's all we need.
Sorry about bothering you.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.543
- Guess I should cancel
my card.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.745
- That seem sketch to you?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.581
- People do lose
their credit cards.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.916
- Especially after cutting
some guy's testes off.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.685
- What, her?

05:17.718 --> 05:21.589
- No, my money goes on
Stanley Kowalski in there.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.758
TARU will run the E-ZPasses.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.362
- I ducked into a hotel bar
to kill some time,

05:28.396 --> 05:31.599
and there was an attractive
woman at the bar, and I...

05:31.632 --> 05:32.766
I start talking to her.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.602
- And what was her name?
- Angela.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.037
Said she was in the city
on business.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.672
- Okay, can you describe her?

05:38.706 --> 05:43.043
- [sighs] Dark hair.
Uh, late 20s.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.778
Maybe 5'6".

05:44.812 --> 05:48.649
- Is that--is that Angela?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.884
- Not even close.

05:50.918 --> 05:55.022
- So, Mr. Karr, tell us exactly
what happened.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.825
- [stammers]

05:57.858 --> 06:00.060
We had some cocktails,
and--and then she invited me

06:00.093 --> 06:04.832
up to her room, and she made me
a drink from the minibar.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.601
And...

06:07.635 --> 06:10.003
we started getting friendly.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
Like you do, you know?

06:11.739 --> 06:15.175
And that's--that's the last
thing I remember.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.177
I just--I came to
on the bed,

06:17.210 --> 06:19.112
and--and I was sitting
in a...

06:19.146 --> 06:22.750
[crying]
In a bloody, sticky mess.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.084
[breathing shakily]

06:24.117 --> 06:27.120
Jesus, I haven't even
called my wife yet.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.656
I mean, what am I gonna say?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.857
- I can certainly
call her for you

06:29.890 --> 06:31.659
and tell her
that you're here,

06:31.692 --> 06:34.862
and that you were a victim of--
of an assault.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.129
- [exhales]

06:36.163 --> 06:39.099
Yeah.
I mean, and then what?

06:39.132 --> 06:44.672
- We're going to find
the person who did this to you.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.141
You're gonna get through this,
Mr. Karr.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.977
- Jason Karr, age 46.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.645
He works as a copy editor

06:51.679 --> 06:53.814
for a company that publishes
trade magazines.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.016
He's married, no kids.
Lives on Grand Street.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.051
- Fin, you get anything
from the hotel bartender?

06:58.085 --> 07:01.154
- Not much. He remembers Karr
with a woman during happy hour.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.790
They paid cash.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.692
- And I get the whole
seduction-robbery thing.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.128
That's been going on for ages.
But why castrate the guy?

07:08.161 --> 07:09.897
- Somebody with anger issues.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.734
- This kind of act is almost
always motivated by revenge.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.168
And there's a sexual component.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.805
- Yeah, but Karr says
he doesn't know the perp.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.740
Could be some psycho
that hates men.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.809
- Or the cutter's taking care
of somebody else's business.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.811
- Yeah, a jilted lover.
Pissed spouse.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.915
- Stanley Kowalski, huh?
Wait, hang on a second.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.884
I think I got something
on the hotel security video.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.053
This is two minutes
before the 911 call.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.722
Fin, you recognize
anybody here?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.189
- That's Julie Wade.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.991
- That's the woman
with the stolen credit card.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.160
- That's right.
So much for being in Yonkers

07:40.193 --> 07:42.162
with her boyfriend that night.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.199
- Am I in some kind of trouble?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.269
- Well, why don't you tell us
about your VISA card again?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.071
- I'm pretty sure I left it
at Costco.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.873
- Well,
that's an out-and-out lie,

07:52.906 --> 07:55.208
because you were
at the Skyline Hotel

07:55.242 --> 07:57.711
on 10th Avenue that night.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.082
- That isn't me.
I mean, it looks like me.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.283
But I was home.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.185
- Okay, well, we also have
your E-ZPass

08:05.218 --> 08:07.955
going into the city
at 5:07 p.m.

08:10.290 --> 08:15.963
*

08:15.996 --> 08:19.800
- So how do you know
Jason Karr?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.302
- Who?
- Come on.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.705
Julie, you're just
digging yourself

08:24.738 --> 08:26.707
into a deeper and deeper hole
right now.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.075
- I don't know him.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.010
- Then why was he
in your hotel room?

08:30.043 --> 08:34.281
- And why did he leave
that room minus his balls?

08:34.314 --> 08:36.116
- I'm sorry, what?

08:36.149 --> 08:38.118
- He was castrated.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.957
- Wait, am I under arrest
for this?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.862
- Not yet.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.131
- Then I better get home.

08:51.164 --> 08:55.035
- Before your boyfriend misses
his 4:00 feeding?

08:55.068 --> 08:58.772
- He doesn't need to know
about this, okay?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.274
- Julie's not a good liar.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.876
- She's terrified.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.344
- So how do we connect her
to Karr?

09:04.377 --> 09:08.148
- Rollins and I showed Karr
her DMV license.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.317
He says he doesn't know her.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.153
- I understand why she would
lie, but why would he lie?

09:13.186 --> 09:15.088
- Fin, did the lab get back
to you about the name

09:15.122 --> 09:17.157
that was on the knife that
we found at the hotel room?

09:17.190 --> 09:19.092
- Cheyenne.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.028
- Cheyenne?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.931
Isn't that a steak house
in Hell's Kitchen?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.933
It's three blocks
from her hotel.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.334
- Maybe that's where
their night started.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.102
I'll check.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.205
[dramatic music]

09:32.840 --> 09:34.842
[lounge music]

09:34.875 --> 09:36.243
- I'm not really good
with faces.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.310
I'm more of a word person.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.180
- Here's a word. Focus.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.915
- What my partner means to say

09:41.949 --> 09:45.185
is that maybe you're just
underestimating yourself.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.987
- I don't think so.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.956
- Okay, Lyla, you on Instagram?

09:48.989 --> 09:50.190
- Yeah.
- What about Tinder?

09:50.223 --> 09:51.959
- Wouldn't you like to know.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.193
- I'll take that as a yes.
What about Facebook?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.128
- Duh.
- See? Photos. Selfies.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.798
Faces, Lyla. You're a pro,
and you didn't even know it.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.266
So do me a favor.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.301
Take a look at these photos
one more time.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.837
Please.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.873
- [sighs]

10:05.906 --> 10:08.909
This guy
I've never seen before.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.211
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she was here that night.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.146
She had dinner
with one of our bar regulars,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.147
a girl named Evelyn.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.348
- Last name?

10:15.382 --> 10:17.818
- Let me check the tab.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.019
Evelyn Bundy.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.021
She had a rez
for a party of three.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.991
A Nora Galen picked up the tab
on her AmEx.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.196
- I don't really understand why
you want to talk to me again.

10:29.229 --> 10:33.000
- We'll explain everything
to you when we sit down.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.270
[indistinct conversation]

10:38.038 --> 10:39.673
- We appreciate you
calling 911, Nora,

10:39.707 --> 10:40.908
but now we want to know
what you were doing

10:40.941 --> 10:42.876
at the hotel that night.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.177
Sit down.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.346
- I told you,
I was visiting a friend.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.116
- We'll need that friend's
name and room number.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.350
Just to verify.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.253
- I can't really give you that.
- Why not?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.288
- Because I'm just
not comfortable

10:55.322 --> 10:56.389
giving out that information.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.091
- Mm.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.027
- Okay, let's try this.
Who were you with

11:00.060 --> 11:01.394
before you went to the hotel?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.263
- I was by myself.
- Nope.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.999
You were having dinner
at the Cheyenne Steakhouse

11:06.033 --> 11:07.901
with a woman named Julie Wade.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.004
- Oh, okay. Yes, Julie.
Now I remember.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.441
- Ah.
- And Evelyn Bundy?

11:14.474 --> 11:16.944
- Evelyn?
I don't know who that is.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.913
- Nora, you're killing me here.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.148
- Oh, you mean Eve.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.482
Sorry, I just met her
that night,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.251
and Julie introduced us.
- Mm.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.053
- But you just pretended
not to know her

11:26.086 --> 11:28.321
when you walked past her
in our squad room.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.125
- That was her?
I didn't recognize her.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.361
- Okay, after dinner, did you
go back to Julie's room?

11:34.394 --> 11:37.064
- Or did you meet Jason Karr
at the hotel bar?

11:37.097 --> 11:39.299
- I just went
to visit my friend.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.134
- Which one? Julie or Jason?

11:44.772 --> 11:47.174
- Okay, it was Julie.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.976
I just didn't want
to get her involved.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.078
- Involved in what?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.080
- [scoffs] You know what?

11:53.113 --> 11:55.983
It's time to cut the crap,
Nora.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.317
- I--I think
I've said everything

11:57.350 --> 11:59.119
I want to say about this.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.453
- I go to that bar a lot.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.922
Half-price drinks
at happy hour.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.190
I met those ladies there.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.992
They were nice enough
to buy me dinner.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.493
- And you had never met
the other two women?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.495
Julie? Nora?
- Nope.

12:08.528 --> 12:13.200
- All right, and what about
a man named Jason Karr?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.235
- Look, I meet a lot of men
all the time.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.937
I really don't keep track
of all of them.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.106
- Maybe this will
jog your memory.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.112
- No.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.483
- What are you doing?
- I have meds.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.152
- What kind of meds?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.788
- Anxiety. Look, I have
a prescription, okay?

12:34.822 --> 12:37.224
- So pills, booze.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.559
What's going on in your life
right now, Evelyn?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.261
- Nothing you need
to know about.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.363
Okay, are we about done here?
- Not really, no.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.098
- Okay, well, maybe you can
tell me what's going on?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.399
- That's fair.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.468
This guy, he was castrated
a couple hours

12:48.501 --> 12:51.371
after you and the ladies were
enjoying a medium-rare rib eye.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.040
- Yeah, okay.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.407
So if you're gonna
keep me here,

12:54.441 --> 12:57.310
I am gonna need my meds,
and I'm gonna need a lawyer.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.182
- Nora works real estate
in Hastings.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.584
Julie keeps house for some bro
in Yonkers.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.386
And Evelyn tends bar here
in the city.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.021
- Hold on.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.490
But her driver's license
address is in Katonah,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.259
which means
that all three of them

13:12.292 --> 13:14.394
have ties to
Westchester County.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.529
- Born in 1979, '78.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.265
What high school
did they go to?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.834
- Nora Galen's
LinkedIn page says

13:20.868 --> 13:23.203
that she went to Packard Prep
in Rye Brook.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.173
- Okay, is there a yearbook
online? Maybe 1995?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.609
- Got it.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.278
Julie was a junior,

13:31.311 --> 13:34.181
and Nora and Evelyn
were sophomores.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.217
- They all name-check something

13:37.250 --> 13:38.618
called the Updike Club
in their bios.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.087
- Okay, is there a photo
of that club?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.455
- The Updike Literary Club.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.161
Look who
their faculty advisor was.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.134
- Jason Karr.

13:54.167 --> 14:01.174
*

14:04.477 --> 14:04.577
.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.678
- It's been nearly 20 years
since I taught at Packard.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.351
I mean, some of these faces
are familiar, but...

14:11.384 --> 14:13.053
- Okay, well, you know what?
Here's an update.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.889
This is Julie Wade.
This is Nora Galen.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.490
This is Evelyn Bundy.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.392
- You think one of these women
mutilated my husband?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.428
- Why don't you tell us,
Mr. Karr?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.296
- They had nothing
to do with it.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.933
- Why would you think it's one
of Jason's former students?

14:25.966 --> 14:28.368
- We're just ruling out
some possibilities.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.472
- Julie Wade here,

14:32.505 --> 14:34.441
she's the one
that booked the hotel room

14:34.474 --> 14:35.909
where you were assaulted.

14:35.943 --> 14:40.447
And Nora made the 911 call
from the hotel.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.382
- And saved your life.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.583
- I don't know
what to tell you.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.953
- So that's all you have
to say?

14:47.654 --> 14:51.024
- Look, uh, it was hard enough
telling my wife

14:51.058 --> 14:53.593
that I went up to a hotel room
with another woman.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.329
And given what's happened,
she's forgiven me.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.431
Haven't you, honey?
- Totally.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.968
- But we'd--we'd like to focus
on my recovery

15:01.001 --> 15:03.603
and put this whole debacle
behind us,

15:03.636 --> 15:06.940
so it's--it's probably best
if you guys leave,

15:06.974 --> 15:08.041
but thank you.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.081
- One thing we did learn,

15:14.114 --> 15:16.149
his child bride knows
he's hiding something.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.417
- Yeah.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.518
- The three women got together

15:18.551 --> 15:19.953
20 years after high school,

15:19.987 --> 15:21.621
and within a few hours,

15:21.654 --> 15:25.058
one of their teachers was found
castrated in a hotel room.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.426
- What's the presumed motive?

15:26.459 --> 15:27.961
- It wasn't
for giving 'em all Cs.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.662
- Given the nature
of the injury,

15:29.696 --> 15:32.065
there's a sexual motivation
behind it.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.566
- Explains why Karr won't talk.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.135
- Yeah, I can't prosecute
the assault

15:35.168 --> 15:36.669
unless the victim makes
an ID.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.671
- Okay, well, how about
we charge the three women

15:38.705 --> 15:40.440
with obstruction?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.142
- For asserting their
Fifth Amendment rights?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.978
- After they lied to us and
obfuscated our investigation.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.713
- Obfuscate. Yummy.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.215
- Hold on, Rafa.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.017
An obstruction charge
would certainly

15:50.050 --> 15:51.618
leverage some cooperation.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.421
If you can't prove the crime,
prove the cover-up.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.456
- You'd have reasonable cause
for an arrest,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.558
but my advice is,
get Jason Karr on board,

15:58.591 --> 16:00.127
or this train is
going nowhere.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.995
- Which we know is
not gonna happen.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.465
- Okay, so we are going to
follow Carisi's suggestion.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.000
Arrest them for obstruction,

16:07.034 --> 16:09.636
and put them all
in the same holding cell.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.413
- You don't return my calls.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.116
- Hi. I am so sorry.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.118
It has been crazy around here,

16:25.152 --> 16:27.720
but I did want to tell you
that both the DA's office

16:27.754 --> 16:32.025
and ACS have closed
their case files.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.061
- Not about that.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.529
Back when I filed
your application for custody,

16:36.563 --> 16:38.698
I was under the impression that

16:38.731 --> 16:41.234
both of Ellie Porter's
parents were dead.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.537
- Yeah.
That's what she told me.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.506
- Ellie lied to you, Olivia.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.509
Her mother is alive.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.044
Shelia Porter.

16:51.078 --> 16:54.747
She hired a PI
to track down her daughter.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.217
They--they somehow found out
about Noah,

16:57.250 --> 17:00.287
and she has now
filed a petition

17:00.320 --> 17:03.756
to vacate Noah's adoption.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.164
- Wow.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.499
Why didn't you corroborate

17:12.532 --> 17:14.767
what Ellie told me
about her parents?

17:14.801 --> 17:16.636
- You're blaming me?
- Yeah, I'm blaming you.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.305
You didn't do your homework.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.507
- Do you know how many Porters
there are in New York State?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.743
- This woman is in New York?
- New Hampshire.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.580
- This is unbelievable.

17:28.848 --> 17:33.286
The one thing
that you had to get right.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.588
- You said she had
no relatives.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.157
- I am not a lawyer.

17:37.190 --> 17:41.161
- You have a database.
- For police business!

17:41.194 --> 17:43.663
- All right, I'm not gonna
stand here and defend myself.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.832
- You better defend yourself.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.804
- We'll fight this, Liv.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.207
- If I lose Noah
after everything

17:54.241 --> 17:56.309
that I've been through...

17:56.343 --> 17:58.878
- That is not going to happen.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.583
Liv, there is no legal basis
to vacate this adoption.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.586
- We both know

18:06.619 --> 18:10.323
that Judge Linden fast-tracked
this adoption for me.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.359
- I know.
Even so, there is--

18:12.392 --> 18:14.627
- Please leave.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.297
Please leave.

who's doing the paperwork

18:37.584 --> 18:38.885
on the obstruction collars?

18:38.918 --> 18:41.688
- Well, your idea,
so I guess that would be you.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.256
- They know we're lying,
Evelyn.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.824
- You clocking this?
- Of course they do!

18:44.857 --> 18:46.159
You have to tell them
what happened.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.560
- I can't.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.628
- Because I'm not going
to jail...

If you tell them the truth,
they'll go easier on you.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.269
- We want to talk to you.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.738
- We'll call your lawyers.
- We don't want lawyers.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.674
We want to tell you the truth.

19:06.613 --> 19:06.713
.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.347
- I was a sophomore at Packard.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.552
I'd just transferred
from public school,

19:12.585 --> 19:16.523
and I didn't have
any friends there.

19:16.556 --> 19:20.627
The best part of my week
was Mr. Karr's poetry class.

19:21.828 --> 19:26.933
Every time I volunteered,
he complimented me.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.536
He gave me confidence,

19:29.569 --> 19:30.870
like a good teacher
is supposed to.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.207
- He wrote notes on my paper
about how smart I was,

19:34.241 --> 19:35.608
or he'd make a joke

19:35.642 --> 19:37.244
about something
somebody said in class.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.979
- One day, he asked me
to stay after class.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.982
He made me a mixtape.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.618
He knew I was really
into grunge.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.688
I was constantly wearing
the same Nirvana T-shirt.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.523
- [scoffs]
All that extra attention,

19:50.557 --> 19:51.858
it made me feel special.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.893
- So when all the rest
of the kids had left,

19:53.926 --> 19:58.265
he pulls this big seashell

19:58.298 --> 19:59.766
out of his bag.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.605
A conch shell
that he'd found at the beach.

20:06.806 --> 20:13.713
He said it was a metaphor
for me.

20:14.781 --> 20:19.652
A treasure washed up
by the waves.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.721
It looked plain on the outside,

20:21.754 --> 20:24.891
but inside,
it was shiny and smooth,

20:24.924 --> 20:27.560
with pink and orange swirls.

20:27.594 --> 20:32.332
So yeah, I was 16.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.535
And he took my breath away.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.770
- And the first time
we had sex,

20:37.804 --> 20:40.807
he invited me
to his apartment near school

20:40.840 --> 20:42.575
to watch a film.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.012
- He asked me if I wanted
to smoke some weed,

20:46.045 --> 20:50.317
listen to some music,
so we went out to his car.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.818
We got high.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.053
- And I knew what we were doing
wasn't cool,

20:54.086 --> 20:57.023
but it was too late.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.826
I'd already accepted
all of his attention.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.928
- Then one day I went
to the coffee place,

21:01.961 --> 21:04.831
like we'd arranged,
and he never showed up.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.800
I felt worthless.

21:07.834 --> 21:11.638
That's when I started
cutting myself.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.773
- So at our 20th reunion,
I'm at the bar

21:13.806 --> 21:15.708
with a couple of girls I know
from the Updike Club,

21:15.742 --> 21:19.679
Julie and Nora,
and Mr. Karr's name comes up.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.350
And we kind of look
at each other.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.884
Julie was the first one
to admit it.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.387
So we told each other
our stories, and we realized

21:27.420 --> 21:29.689
how Mr. Karr
had screwed us all up.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.958
How Julie took her shame out
on her own body,

21:31.991 --> 21:34.627
how Nora's always alone because
she can't trust anybody,

21:34.661 --> 21:36.796
and me, well...

21:38.998 --> 21:41.934
So Nora Googled him.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.838
And we saw that he has a job
in the city now.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.975
We had this idea
that if we could confront him

21:49.008 --> 21:52.645
about what he did, then maybe
we could get some closure.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.814
So Julie reached out to him,

21:54.847 --> 21:59.752
and he agreed to meet her
at the hotel bar.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.721
Nora and I were waiting
in the room

22:01.754 --> 22:05.992
when Julie brought him
upstairs.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.094
- And then what happened?

22:08.127 --> 22:09.896
- Then...

22:11.698 --> 22:14.734
You don't understand.
You're a man.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.772
- Listen to me, Evelyn.

22:19.806 --> 22:23.776
That man is a predator,

22:23.810 --> 22:25.412
and he should be in prison.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.681
- Yeah, what do you know
about it?

22:28.715 --> 22:31.751
- You're right. I don't know.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.887
But I do have a niece.

22:34.921 --> 22:38.157
If I found out one of her
teachers was doing that to her,

22:38.190 --> 22:42.061
cop or no cop, I would beat
the living crap out of him.

22:44.964 --> 22:48.034
- At first...

22:48.067 --> 22:49.769
at first we just asked him

22:49.802 --> 22:52.805
if he remembered
what he did to us.

22:52.839 --> 22:56.743
You could tell he never even
gave it a second thought.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.044
He said he was a great teacher.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.046
He encouraged
our love of the arts,

23:00.079 --> 23:03.015
and--and anyways, we had a lot
of experience with boys

23:03.049 --> 23:06.719
and we seduced him.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.921
Okay, that's when I lost it.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.790
That's when I knew
I needed to damage him

23:10.823 --> 23:13.926
the same way
he damaged me.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.828
- What did you do?

23:15.862 --> 23:19.732
- I spiked his drink
with my pills.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.801
And when he passed out,

23:21.834 --> 23:24.070
I got the knife that I stole
from the restaurant

23:24.103 --> 23:27.807
and I told Julie and Nora
to leave, and I...

23:32.845 --> 23:36.082
Do you know
what contrapasso  means?

23:36.115 --> 23:38.150
- No.

23:38.184 --> 23:41.954
- It's from Dante's "Inferno."

23:41.988 --> 23:44.924
A punishment
a sinner gets in hell

23:44.957 --> 23:48.060
is the opposite of his sin.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.865
So thank you, Mr. Karr.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.501
You always did encourage me

23:54.534 --> 23:56.736
to read the classics.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.108
- [exhales slowly]

24:04.210 --> 24:06.713
Hey, Lieutenant.
Evelyn says the other women

24:06.746 --> 24:07.780
had no idea it was coming.

24:07.814 --> 24:08.881
They did not participate.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.517
- They tried to cover it up.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.885
- But they came clean, so
the obstruction charge is moot.

24:12.919 --> 24:16.923
- Okay, so charge Evelyn
with Assault One.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.759
Call Barba, and get her
downtown to arraignment.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.093
- You know what, though?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.062
With what he did to these women
in high school,

24:23.095 --> 24:24.997
if the statute of limitations
hadn't already expired,

24:25.031 --> 24:27.800
we'd be charging Jason Karr
too right now.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.837
- You're right.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.873
Get Evelyn back here tomorrow
with her lawyer.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.975
Maybe we can get
a quick plea deal

24:36.008 --> 24:38.978
and put this whole thing
to bed.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.915
- My client's interested in
pleading guilty to the assault,

24:42.949 --> 24:45.585
but first we'd like to give you
a little more context

24:45.618 --> 24:47.286
if you agree not to use it
in court.

24:47.319 --> 24:51.157
- Okay, I'll have to run any
disposition by the DA's office.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.164
Let's get started.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.000
- Look, I know I did
a terrible thing.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.971
I--I was so freaked out
to see him again,

25:05.004 --> 25:06.939
and--and I had
way too much to drink,

25:06.973 --> 25:10.142
and then I just snapped.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.612
You know, when he said that
it was our fault,

25:12.645 --> 25:15.782
that we were responsible...

25:15.815 --> 25:17.550
- And I wish we could
arrest him

25:17.584 --> 25:20.219
for what he did 20 years ago,

25:20.252 --> 25:22.121
but the prosecutions

25:22.154 --> 25:25.191
for the statutory rapes
that he committed at Packard

25:25.224 --> 25:29.195
are now barred by the statute
of limitations.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.631
- Right, but you're still
gonna charge me.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.232
- You didn't punch him
in the face

25:33.265 --> 25:34.233
and break his nose, Evelyn.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.603
You disfigured him.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.070
You took a knife.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.872
- Yeah, I took a knife
for protection.

25:39.906 --> 25:43.976
- Protection from what?
- From Karr.

25:44.010 --> 25:47.046
He can get violent.
- Violent how?

25:50.249 --> 25:53.319
- It was the last time
I went to his apartment.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.255
I went over there to tell him
that it was over,

25:56.288 --> 25:58.891
because I'd heard he was
seeing some other girl.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.927
A senior in his advisory.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.629
And he got angry.

26:02.662 --> 26:06.232
And he told me that he wasn't
ready to say good-bye yet.

26:07.934 --> 26:11.203
And then he...

26:11.237 --> 26:14.907
He took a corkscrew,
and he held it to my face.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.644
And he told me not to scream,

26:17.677 --> 26:19.879
and then he held me down

26:19.912 --> 26:23.950
and forced me to have sex
with him, so...

26:27.186 --> 26:29.255
[knocks on glass]
- You on this?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.390
- Force. Rape One.
- No statute of limitations.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.292
- Now hold on. Did she just
come up with that

26:33.325 --> 26:35.361
because Vincent told her
that we can't prosecute Karr?

26:35.394 --> 26:37.029
- That's not what I saw.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.865
- For Evelyn to do
what she did to him,

26:38.898 --> 26:39.999
I believe every word of it.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.002
[suspenseful music]

26:43.035 --> 26:46.172
*

26:46.205 --> 26:48.908
- I told you, I have nothing
more to say about this.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.342
- Mr. Karr, please step outside
and turn around.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.344
- What are you--what?
Why are you arresting me?

26:52.378 --> 26:55.014
- You're charged with rape
in the first degree

26:55.047 --> 26:56.382
on the complaint
of Evelyn Bundy.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.718
- Are you serious?
After what she did to him?

26:58.751 --> 27:00.119
- Ma'am. Ma'am!
- This is outrageous!

27:00.152 --> 27:01.954
- Stop.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.324
*

27:09.762 --> 27:10.162
.

27:10.196 --> 27:10.697
- I'm Lieutenant Benson--

27:12.131 --> 27:14.734
- How can you do this
to my husband?

27:14.767 --> 27:16.368
- I can't imagine having to--

27:16.402 --> 27:18.805
- Do you even understand
what that bitch did to him?

27:18.838 --> 27:22.274
- Of course I do.
And it is awful.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.243
- But he's the one
being prosecuted

27:24.276 --> 27:27.079
for something 20 years ago
that probably never happened.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.317
- With all due respect,
you weren't there, were you?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.119
- [scoffs]

27:33.152 --> 27:37.089
- I understand why you would
want to support your husband.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.726
- Jason is not a rapist!

27:41.127 --> 27:43.095
- You know, I'm curious.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.297
How did you two meet?

27:45.331 --> 27:47.433
- So you think
because he's older than me,

27:47.466 --> 27:50.737
that he has, what?
Some kind of fetish?

27:50.770 --> 27:53.172
- I didn't say that.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.207
- We met four years ago.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.743
I had a summer internship

27:56.776 --> 27:58.244
at the publisher
he was working for.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.747
- So you were in college.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.348
- We fell in love.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.818
We wanted to have a family.
So much for that.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.788
- You know, I have a son.

28:08.821 --> 28:13.325
And I adopted him, and he--

28:13.359 --> 28:17.329
he is what makes
everything worth it.

28:17.363 --> 28:22.134
- After what my husband
has been through,

28:22.168 --> 28:24.070
it would just be a reminder
of the night

28:24.103 --> 28:26.839
he stopped being a man.

28:26.873 --> 28:31.143
You're really going to try
to put him in jail after that?

28:31.177 --> 28:33.345
- I'm sorry for what happened
to you.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.114
I really am.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.151
But that's not up to me.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.154
[melancholy music]

28:42.188 --> 28:49.361
*

28:52.231 --> 28:55.802
- It was the spring
of my sophomore year.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.938
There was a rumor going around
that Mr. Karr was hooking up

28:58.971 --> 29:01.107
with a girl
in the senior class,

29:01.140 --> 29:04.310
so I went to tell him

29:04.343 --> 29:08.147
that I wouldn't be coming over
to his apartment anymore.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.149
And he lost it.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.385
He told me that I couldn't
break up with him.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.288
Only he could break up with me.

29:16.322 --> 29:21.293
Then he grabbed me,
threw me down on the floor,

29:21.327 --> 29:23.762
pulled my pants off.

29:25.397 --> 29:30.837
I tried to tell him to stop,
but he got on top of me.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.404
I tried to get away from him,

29:32.438 --> 29:35.842
but he grabbed a corkscrew
off the coffee table

29:35.875 --> 29:38.845
and held it to my face.

29:38.878 --> 29:44.216
He told me if I screamed,
he would cut me with it.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.519
- What did he do then?

29:47.553 --> 29:51.891
- Then he put his penis
in my vagina, and he raped me.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.161
- Thank you, Evelyn.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.795
No further questions.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.301
- But you didn't tell anyone
at the time

30:02.334 --> 30:03.602
that this had happened?

30:03.635 --> 30:07.406
Not a parent, a friend,
a guidance counselor?

30:07.439 --> 30:09.341
- I didn't think anyone
would believe me.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.444
- Because for six months you'd
been having consensual sex?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.281
- No, I wasn't old enough
to consent.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.017
I...acquiesced.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.952
- That's a fancy word
that means you liked it?

30:19.986 --> 30:21.587
- Objection.
- Overruled.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.456
I'll allow it.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.326
- At the time,
I was young and confused.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.462
- Were you young and confused
when you stole a steak knife

30:30.496 --> 30:32.364
and castrated him?

30:32.398 --> 30:34.233
- No.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.335
No, yes, I was.
I was confused.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.603
- Maybe you're confused
right now

30:37.636 --> 30:40.406
about what he did to you
in high school.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.374
- No, I'm not confused
about that.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.243
- Maybe this story
of forcible rape

30:44.276 --> 30:45.644
has come 20 years
after the fact

30:45.677 --> 30:47.880
because that's the only way
my client

30:47.914 --> 30:49.315
can be prosecuted now.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.617
- He should be prosecuted
for all of it.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.252
I was 16 years old,

30:53.285 --> 30:54.553
and a teacher
that I looked up to,

30:54.586 --> 30:58.257
that I trusted,
took advantage of me.

31:04.030 --> 31:07.900
Do you remember this, Mr. Karr?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.904
Jason?

31:11.938 --> 31:15.241
I saved it as a reminder
of what happened between us.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.910
- Move to strike.
This is not responsive.

31:23.449 --> 31:26.018
- [breathing shakily]

31:26.052 --> 31:29.021
[dramatic music]

31:29.055 --> 31:30.322
*

31:30.356 --> 31:32.058
- We're in recess.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.660
Let's get her some
medical attention, please.

31:34.693 --> 31:41.900
*

31:47.106 --> 31:49.541
- Mrs. Karr.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.710
- There's something
you should see.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.446
Jason kept a box of papers

31:54.480 --> 31:57.049
from his teaching days
in the basement.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.684
After I saw Evelyn in court,

31:58.717 --> 32:01.353
I went downstairs to see
what was in there.

32:01.387 --> 32:02.721
- "Packard Literary Journal,"
from '95.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.992
- Look at page 15.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.460
- It's a poem.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.333
- Why are you showing this
to us?

32:14.366 --> 32:17.536
You know this could hurt
your husband's case.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.977
- [scoffs]

32:28.080 --> 32:34.586
*

32:38.157 --> 32:38.557
.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.325
- I was three years
out of college

32:40.792 --> 32:42.494
when Evelyn was
in my poetry class.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.096
- You've heard her testimony.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.232
Did you do the things
she claims you did?

32:46.265 --> 32:47.699
- I need to explain this.

32:47.733 --> 32:51.670
I--I was young and immature,
and Evelyn...

32:51.703 --> 32:53.772
[sighs]
I had real feelings for her.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.509
I know that sounds creepy now,
but I was just 24 years old,

32:57.543 --> 32:59.311
and I developed a crush on her.

32:59.345 --> 33:04.016
And when I look back on it now,
I know that there's no excuse

33:04.050 --> 33:06.352
for--for my behavior,
whatever my feelings were.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.721
I took advantage of my position
of power, and that was wrong.

33:09.755 --> 33:13.792
And for that, I am truly,
truly sorry.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.263
But I never used physical force
to get Evelyn

33:17.296 --> 33:19.265
to have sex with me.
Never.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.799
- Did you explain this to her

33:20.832 --> 33:22.801
when she confronted you
in that hotel room?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.270
- I tried to.
That's why I agreed

33:24.303 --> 33:25.571
to go see Julie that night,

33:25.604 --> 33:27.606
to say that I was sorry.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.675
- Can you describe for us

33:29.708 --> 33:33.079
how that encounter
impacted your life?

33:34.380 --> 33:38.584
- Well, after I was maimed,
I had plastic surgery

33:38.617 --> 33:40.286
to reconstruct my scrotum.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.088
I have prosthetic testicles.

33:42.121 --> 33:45.624
I'll be on hormone replacement
for the rest of my life.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.126
I have nightmares.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.660
And every time
I look down there,

33:48.694 --> 33:50.696
I, uh--I'm reminded
all over again

33:50.729 --> 33:53.265
that I'm never gonna
have children.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.703
[crying] I'm never gonna be
able to raise a family.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.708
- Do you need a moment, Jason?

34:03.209 --> 34:07.113
- That someone could do this
to another human being...

34:10.116 --> 34:13.852
I know that I behaved badly
when I was at Packard,

34:13.885 --> 34:17.656
and I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

34:17.689 --> 34:20.126
But haven't I suffered enough?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.436
- When you--
when you taught at Packard,

34:30.469 --> 34:32.404
there was
a student literary journal.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.206
Is that correct?

34:34.240 --> 34:35.607
- Yes.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.676
- And so the students would--

34:37.709 --> 34:41.680
would submit their writing
for inclusion in the magazine?

34:41.713 --> 34:43.382
- That's correct.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.151
- Okay.

34:47.153 --> 34:51.657
I'd like to have that marked
as People's Seven

34:51.690 --> 34:53.259
for identification.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.795
Could you read the poem
on page 15 to the jury, please?

34:56.828 --> 34:58.797
- Move to strike.
Where is this going?

34:58.830 --> 35:01.167
- It'll become readily apparent
in short order, Your Honor.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.869
- I'll give you some latitude,
Mr. Barba, but get to it.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.172
- Thank you.

35:06.205 --> 35:10.476
Please read the poem aloud,
Mr. Karr.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.278
Start with the title.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.148
- "Corkscrew."

35:17.216 --> 35:19.451
"Friday afternoons
will never be the same,

35:19.485 --> 35:21.453
"no golden sunlight streaming

35:21.487 --> 35:23.855
"or songbirds serenading
in the trees.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.458
"Just the rank taste
of cheap wine

35:26.492 --> 35:28.427
"and the brown stain
on the ceiling

35:28.460 --> 35:30.829
"as numb and naive I lie,

35:30.862 --> 35:32.798
"pinned to your filthy floor

35:32.831 --> 35:35.401
"and you,
corkscrew in your sweaty fist,

35:35.434 --> 35:38.204
crush my soul."

35:38.237 --> 35:39.805
- As a former teacher
of literature,

35:39.838 --> 35:42.841
could you conclude
that the author of this poem

35:42.874 --> 35:46.245
had personally endured
an act of sexual violence?

35:46.278 --> 35:49.815
- Everybody knows that poems
are feats of imagination.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.950
Projections, or metaphors.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.421
- Right.
Who wrote that poem, sir?

35:55.454 --> 35:58.424
[tense music]

35:58.457 --> 36:00.426
*

36:00.459 --> 36:02.361
- Evelyn Bundy.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.863
- When?

36:09.335 --> 36:11.803
- April, '95.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.975
- Nothing further.

36:17.008 --> 36:24.250
*

36:29.455 --> 36:30.856
- You mind?

36:30.889 --> 36:32.991
- Am I that predictable?

36:33.024 --> 36:36.328
- You are...

36:36.362 --> 36:39.565
but this is a tough case.

36:39.598 --> 36:43.802
- Listen, I'm...

36:43.835 --> 36:46.004
considering offering a deal.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.874
Karr does the same four years
Evelyn Bundy agreed to.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.976
- You proved forcible rape.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.312
- If she cut off his finger,
if she poked him in the eye--

36:53.345 --> 36:54.480
- It shouldn't make
a difference.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.315
- We don't live in a vacuum.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.917
I can assure you,
the seven guys on that jury,

36:58.950 --> 37:00.486
they feel Karr's pain.

37:00.519 --> 37:04.290
- And if Karr wasn't castrated,
if he had cancer--

37:04.323 --> 37:06.392
- It's not the same thing.
- It should be.

37:06.425 --> 37:10.329
Why do we do this, Raphael?

37:10.362 --> 37:13.365
Because the next girl
who gets raped needs to know

37:13.399 --> 37:16.368
that that person is us.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.304
No matter what.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.908
[dramatic music]

37:22.941 --> 37:26.044
- The question then becomes,
what is justice?

37:26.077 --> 37:30.882
Or more precisely,
exactly how much retribution

37:30.916 --> 37:32.384
does a criminal owe?

37:32.418 --> 37:35.554
How much vengeance
does a victim deserve?

37:35.587 --> 37:39.925
Sure, we can pore over volumes
and volumes of legal doctrine,

37:39.958 --> 37:41.593
but when push comes to shove,

37:41.627 --> 37:45.397
the answer is way more visceral
than it is scholarly.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.866
It's human nature.
It's hard-wired into us,

37:47.899 --> 37:49.468
like eating and sleeping.

37:49.501 --> 37:53.872
You're wronged.
You need to wrong someone back.

37:53.905 --> 37:57.509
To be sure,
Evelyn Bundy already took

37:57.543 --> 37:59.611
Jason Karr's
metaphorical eye.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.414
Now what Mr. Barba wants

38:02.448 --> 38:06.084
is for you to throw in
an ear as well.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.986
But is that just?

38:08.019 --> 38:10.088
Our innate sense of fair play

38:10.121 --> 38:12.090
tells us that
to cause Jason to suffer

38:12.123 --> 38:14.560
any more than he already has

38:14.593 --> 38:16.528
would be tantamount
to giving Evelyn

38:16.562 --> 38:19.965
more justice
than she actually deserves.

38:19.998 --> 38:24.370
My friends, please.
That simply wouldn't be fair.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.873
Thank you.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.985
[crumpling paper]

38:41.052 --> 38:44.623
- Hasn't he suffered enough?

38:44.656 --> 38:47.359
My vote is yes, he has.

38:47.393 --> 38:51.062
I mean, Jason assaulted Evelyn.
Evelyn assaulted him back.

38:51.096 --> 38:54.866
That sounds fair to me.
Sounds like justice at work.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.935
To be just, it has to be fair.

38:56.968 --> 39:00.038
I mean, that's what
Ms. Rivers asserts.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.474
You know, I can't really
disagree with that.

39:02.508 --> 39:06.645
In purely pound of flesh terms,
Mr. Karr certainly gave up

39:06.678 --> 39:08.480
a hell of a lot more
than he got.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.950
Fair? Not a chance.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.386
To be totally fair,

39:14.420 --> 39:17.623
you should give Jason
one of Evelyn's breasts.

39:17.656 --> 39:21.627
An arm, maybe.
That's only fair.

39:21.660 --> 39:27.165
And as we have now decided,
that means it's just.

39:27.198 --> 39:31.169
Jason Karr forcibly raped
Evelyn Bundy

39:31.202 --> 39:34.606
when she was little more
than a child.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.175
But to tack a prison sentence

39:37.208 --> 39:41.079
on Mr. Karr's already
gargantuan suffering

39:41.112 --> 39:44.049
would tip the balance of
justice in Ms. Bundy's favor,

39:44.082 --> 39:46.618
and hey,
there's no way that's fair,

39:46.652 --> 39:49.555
so there's no way that's just.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.691
A man whose store burns down
rushes out, buys some gasoline,

39:52.724 --> 39:55.093
a book of matches, and sets the
house of the arsonist on fire.

39:55.126 --> 39:59.531
Hey! It's fair,
so that means it's just!

39:59.565 --> 40:02.434
A man whose children
have been murdered buys a gun

40:02.468 --> 40:04.670
and splatters the brains
of the killer's children

40:04.703 --> 40:06.572
all over their bedroom walls.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.174
It's fair. It's just.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.978
Why bother with cops or courts?

40:14.079 --> 40:17.483
If it's fair,
it has to be just!

40:17.516 --> 40:19.685
Let the blood flow
in the streets, I say!

40:19.718 --> 40:21.086
Oh, wait, you don't like it?

40:21.119 --> 40:23.689
I say get a bigger pair
of boots.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.692
[dramatic music]

40:26.725 --> 40:34.065
*

40:40.271 --> 40:42.741
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

40:42.774 --> 40:45.577
- We have, Your Honor.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.245
- How do you find?

40:47.278 --> 40:49.548
- We find the defendant,
Jason Karr,

40:49.581 --> 40:52.083
guilty of rape
in the first degree.

40:52.117 --> 40:59.491
*

41:07.298 --> 41:11.703
- "So Peter Rabbit was so tired
that he flopped down

41:11.737 --> 41:13.004
"on the nice, soft sand

41:13.038 --> 41:14.740
"on the floor
of the rabbit hole,

41:14.773 --> 41:16.842
"and he shut his eyes.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.777
His mother was busy cooking."

41:18.810 --> 41:20.712
- What was she cooking?

41:20.746 --> 41:22.548
- Probably sushi.

41:22.581 --> 41:25.250
- [laughs]
Rabbits don't eat sushi.

41:25.283 --> 41:29.087
- "She wondered what he had
done with his clothes.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.157
"It was the second
little jacket and shoes

41:32.190 --> 41:34.192
that Peter had lost
in a fortnight--"

41:34.225 --> 41:36.161
[knocking on door]

41:37.863 --> 41:39.631
Did you invite
somebody over?

41:39.665 --> 41:41.132
- No, you did.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.734
- No, I didn't.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.637
Let me check who it is,
sweetie.

41:45.671 --> 41:48.073
[knocking continues]

41:52.778 --> 41:54.846
- Olivia Benson?

41:54.880 --> 41:57.849
- Yes.

41:57.883 --> 42:03.088
- I'm Sheila Porter.
Noah's grandmother.
