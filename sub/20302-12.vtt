NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues…

00:03.461 --> 00:05.797
Frank Jr. was listening on the other phone

00:05.880 --> 00:08.925
while that pervert was spewing
that twisted filth at me.

00:09.009 --> 00:09.968
I'm serious.

00:10.051 --> 00:13.722
There's gonna be a J.D. LaRue Saloondromat
in every town in this country.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.725
This is it, Henry-- Saloondromat.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.643
Where the hell is Marv?

00:18.727 --> 00:21.187
Nothing works in this place.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.441
-No furnace, no phone, no nothing.
-I'll get him.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.234
Wanna stop screwing around?

00:26.860 --> 00:27.819
Marv--

00:28.445 --> 00:29.904
Good-bye, old friend.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.240
He did it, and we got him, and that's it.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.326
Which adds up to murder one
for the Rodriguez kid.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.204
It was Ma-McAurley, the councilman guy.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.040
You got a great imagination.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.417
What have you got
against Councilman Tom McAurley?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.877
Not a thing.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.920
Let Emil Schneider do it.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.132
I'm blaming you for this screwing around,
wasting of my time.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.843
You would never have
if you hadn't been humping for commander.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.429
I think we're asking for it
if we don't give it a rest

00:54.512 --> 00:56.681
until this thing is over,
and don't do that.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.977
All we need is a rumor of collusion
between the P.D.'s office and you.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.107
(man coughs)

01:06.191 --> 01:10.779
Item nine-- the 400 block
of Von Steuben Avenue,

01:10.862 --> 01:15.116
or as it's more commonly designated,
"Sniper Alley."

01:16.201 --> 01:19.412
As you are no doubt aware,
Officers Ludwig and Carmichael

01:19.496 --> 01:23.750
chose to disregard
this previously aforementioned item

01:23.833 --> 01:27.128
and took a rather costly joyride
down the gauntlet last week,

01:27.212 --> 01:30.381
precipitating notable damage to their unit

01:30.965 --> 01:33.510
and a one-way ticket off the Hill.

01:34.177 --> 01:39.390
So, let's take a lesson
from this episode--

01:40.141 --> 01:42.143
parts and labor-wise,

01:42.227 --> 01:44.479
career-wise, and otherwise,

01:44.938 --> 01:47.607
and stay clear of that shooting gallery.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.693
Unless you are in hot pursuit
of a major, major felon,

01:50.777 --> 01:54.030
I don't even want you
looking up the alley.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.281
Understand?

01:56.741 --> 01:57.951
All right. Item 10.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.704
We received another report
about the motorcyclist

02:02.497 --> 02:05.250
buzzing St. Teresa's
without the benefit of clothing.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.962
Now, he's been described
as a male Caucasian in his early 60s,

02:09.045 --> 02:13.675
driving a red, 500cc Royal Enfield

02:13.758 --> 02:15.677
with a baby-blue helmet

02:15.760 --> 02:20.014
and a large tattoo
on his right upper buttock,

02:20.598 --> 02:23.768
plus numerous tattoos on his upper body.

02:23.852 --> 02:29.649
Now, these are
devout elderly ladies and nuns

02:29.732 --> 02:33.069
being subjected to a public invasion

02:33.153 --> 02:35.947
of privates, as it were.

02:38.783 --> 02:42.203
Your uncustomary silence
testifies amply to the esteem

02:42.287 --> 02:45.456
in which we hold the subject
of this last item.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.211
Now, we all know who is in here.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.965
To most people,
this would seem just a common urn.

02:54.048 --> 02:58.303
But we know it holds one of the premier

02:58.386 --> 03:00.430
phone installers of the country,

03:01.139 --> 03:04.017
Officer Marvin Oliver Box,

03:04.100 --> 03:06.978
-or simply "Marv" as we knew him.
-(sobbing)

03:07.061 --> 03:11.024
Born, 16 May, 1946.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.694
Deceased, just last Tuesday,
in this very room,

03:14.777 --> 03:18.072
with uniform on and drill bit in hand.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.366
Marv must've known
that he'd be leaving us soon,

03:20.450 --> 03:23.786
because we found a small poem in his will

03:24.412 --> 03:27.916
which we've had inscribed
on this-- this vessel here.

03:28.958 --> 03:34.214
Uh, "I've laid a lot of cable,
and I've strung a lot of line.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.718
Sure, it gets lonely, but that's okay,

03:39.969 --> 03:43.264
because it brings people closer together."

03:44.224 --> 03:45.850
Per his final will and testament,

03:45.934 --> 03:49.270
Marv was cremated yesterday
at Bolinski's Crematorium,

03:49.354 --> 03:51.231
and he will lie in state

03:51.314 --> 03:54.525
besides the squad room coffee machine

03:54.609 --> 03:56.319
for the remainder of the afternoon.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.570
(sobbing)

03:59.781 --> 04:01.199
Marv, let's roll, huh?

04:03.159 --> 04:04.744
And let's be careful up there.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.830
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:10.041
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:10.124 --> 04:13.920
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:20.843 --> 04:24.764
(theme music playing)

05:21.571 --> 05:24.365
(sad music playing)

05:41.215 --> 05:43.593
At least you got out
while the getting was good, Marv.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.053
'Cause you can take it from me,

05:45.136 --> 05:47.388
there's a lot of changes
going down around here,

05:47.472 --> 05:49.682
and none of 'em are for the better.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.524
I'll tell you, Neal.
This being a businessman's given me

05:58.608 --> 05:59.776
a whole new outlook on life.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.195
Yeah, me too, lover.
It's called major trauma.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.906
Oh, hey, look.
I, uh, picked up the keys last night.

06:04.989 --> 06:09.410
Hey! Gotta hand it to you, J.D.
You got a lot of guts, man,

06:09.494 --> 06:11.621
considering the neighborhood
we bought into.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.705
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.458
Hey, looking pretty ragged there, Mick.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.126
You been sleeping okay, babe?

06:18.669 --> 06:20.922
Hmm. I wonder what's eating him.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.341
-Hard to tell unless he growls.
-(chuckles)

06:25.635 --> 06:27.595
Aside from the obvious fashion angle,

06:27.678 --> 06:30.390
there's another advantage
to being in plainclothes.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.519
You're not gonna end up in some lousy urn
on a precinct coffee table.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.438
Marv there died of natural causes, Renko.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.733
When you go down in uniform, there ain't
no such thing as natural causes.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.485
You oughta know that as well as anybody.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.737
First thing happen to you,
the first thing you say--

06:44.821 --> 06:46.781
(rattling)

06:46.864 --> 06:50.451
Oh, Lord, am I going crazy,
or did I just hear him rattle?

06:50.535 --> 06:54.330
Bones, Renko. Bones.
It's obviously a third-rate cremation job.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.418
You know, you'd be amazed at the number
of Fahrenheit units it takes

06:58.501 --> 07:00.670
to fully ash the human skeletal system.

07:01.671 --> 07:06.342
2,400 minimum for your larger bones,
like your femur or your fibula.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.762
And that doesn't even mention
the, uh, goldarn cranium.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.180
(rattling)

07:14.559 --> 07:16.185
(phone ringing in the distance)

07:17.145 --> 07:20.148
(indistinct station chatter)

07:23.317 --> 07:24.193
How many?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.572
Thirty-six arrests in the past 24 hours,

07:27.655 --> 07:30.783
and that's not even counting three collars
he gave to Bates.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.035
I just got the breakdown 10 minutes ago.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.708
Now, Phil, we know Belker moves fast,
but this is hard to believe.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.712
-Has he been working overtime?
-He's been punching out after eight hours,

07:42.795 --> 07:44.922
but according to those arrest times,

07:45.006 --> 07:48.217
he's been bringing in suspects
nearly 24 hours a day.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.095
Well, something's wrong here, Phil.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.306
I mean,
either with these reports or with Belker.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.558
Tell him I want to see him
as soon as he gets back in.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.268
-All right.
-Hill, Renko!

07:57.810 --> 07:59.312
-Captain?
-Yes, sir?

07:59.395 --> 08:02.023
Cleaners lose your uniforms,
or have you outgrown them by now?

08:02.106 --> 08:02.940
Well, no, sir.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.985
Actually, we just had a little
more work to do on that Rivas murder case.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.821
We'll have that Councilman McAurley
on ice for you in a day or two.

08:08.905 --> 08:12.241
Appreciate your zeal, Renko,
but Chesley's already got a handle on it.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.995
Well, then,
where does that leave me and Bobby?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.915
Back in uniform and out on the streets,
where we really need you.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.125
-Yeah, but--
-I've already forwarded

08:21.209 --> 08:22.919
your transfer to plainclothes,

08:23.002 --> 08:26.005
but until we hear from Division,
it's business as usual, okay?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.758
Don't worry, cowboy.
You'll look just fine in a jar.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.638
Listen, I'm running late, Phil.
What else do you have here?

08:33.721 --> 08:36.057
Just a call from Midtown.
They're sending over the tape

08:36.140 --> 08:38.309
they got of Fay's obscene phone caller.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.770
Good. Hang onto it.
I'll listen to it when I get back.

08:40.853 --> 08:41.896
That's it?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.400
Can't keep destiny waiting.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.695
(theme music playing)

09:03.334 --> 09:05.169
(horn honking)

09:13.636 --> 09:16.222
-What a pleasant coincidence.
-No coincidence, Furillo.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.933
-I phoned your office. Get in.
-I've got a breakfast. I'm late.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.810
Frank, would you please get in?

09:27.900 --> 09:30.611
My client, Nemo Rodriguez?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.114
They traced the gun
to someone who allegedly sold it to him

09:33.197 --> 09:35.575
three days before the Rivas girl shooting.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.952
That gives the D.A.
enough for premeditation.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.871
-I didn't know.
-Neither did I.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.958
-Not until I walked into that courtroom.
-(horn honking)

09:44.041 --> 09:47.295
Oh! Hey, why don't you go around me?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.297
(exhales)

09:49.839 --> 09:51.424
Frank, I have spent over a week

09:51.507 --> 09:54.468
preparing a defense
for involuntary manslaughter,

09:54.552 --> 09:56.387
only to have him arraigned today

09:56.470 --> 09:58.848
for first degree murder with no bail.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.683
What are you really mad about, Counselor?

10:00.766 --> 10:01.767
Being suckered in court

10:01.851 --> 10:04.020
or the fact that McAurley
may be telling the truth,

10:04.103 --> 10:05.146
and the D.A.'s right?

10:05.229 --> 10:07.690
You don't believe that
any more than I do, Frank.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.610
If Nemo did shoot the girl,
he never meant to.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.236
That much I know in my bones.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.822
(sighs)

10:14.905 --> 10:17.116
-What's with Schneider? Anything?
-No.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.160
But I expect to run into him
this afternoon.

10:20.036 --> 10:20.953
(exhales)

10:23.581 --> 10:27.501
I think our prudent separation
is making us both a little testy.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.213
Wasn't my idea, kiddo.
Boy, you smell good.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.176
But then, only one of us is going home
to an empty apartment.

10:35.926 --> 10:39.347
What am I supposed to do?
Send her back to that phone pervert?

10:45.686 --> 10:46.646
Of course not.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.731
(sighs)

10:48.814 --> 10:50.650
How's Frank Jr. taking it?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.610
He's a little confused.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.030
He thinks his mom and dad
may be getting back together.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.032
Are they?

11:00.951 --> 11:03.329
I'm sorry, Frank.
I shouldn't have said that.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.916
-I'll talk to you later.
-Frank!

11:11.253 --> 11:13.464
(indistinct chatter)

11:29.522 --> 11:31.774
I'd recommend the eggs Benedict, Frank,

11:32.316 --> 11:34.860
but the hollandaise
is probably petrified by now.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.364
(laughter)

11:42.785 --> 11:43.953
-Hello, Howard.
-Frank.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.205
-Ed.
-Morning, Frank.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.416
I'm sorry, Chief.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.544
It's not all that easy
to get off the Hill, huh, Frank?

11:52.378 --> 11:55.548
Too bad we don't take attendance
at these breakfasts into account, Dave.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.926
Old Ed would be a shoo-in for
commander against Frank there.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.678
There's no doubt about it, Chief.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.807
I'll bet you're wondering
about our little centerpiece, Frank.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.392
Looks a little like Sniper Alley.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.269
DANIELS (snaps fingers): You guessed it.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.895
Just a terrific job, Howard.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.690
-Just splendid.
-(congratulatory murmuring and clapping)

12:12.773 --> 12:14.525
-Thank you.
-Will you look at that?

12:14.608 --> 12:16.235
He's even got little people in there.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.612
(chuckles)
They're scale-model Hispanics, Chief.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.573
I was hoping you'd notice.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.699
Okay, Howard.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.995
(whispers):
What's he got in store for us?

12:26.078 --> 12:27.079
Wait and see.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.003
(whirring)

12:37.840 --> 12:41.677
(laughing)

12:41.761 --> 12:43.971
(appreciative murmuring and clapping)

12:45.765 --> 12:49.143
That's it, Frank-- surprise.
That's the baby.

12:49.226 --> 12:55.232
As a matter of fact,
Howard's already shown me his baby.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.736
The surprise, Frank, is that its mother

12:58.819 --> 13:02.406
just arrived from Nishitsu's
Nagasaki plant last night--

13:02.490 --> 13:04.408
all 25 tons of her.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.076
Howard's gonna be taking her out

13:06.160 --> 13:08.662
for a little spin
down the real Sniper Alley this afternoon.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.750
If you don't mind my saying so, Chief,
we're making a grave mistake.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.543
Relax, Frank, relax.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.796
It's just a dry run.
It won't even be loaded.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.924
Except maybe for those two little guns
in the top turret there.

13:20.007 --> 13:20.925
(chuckles)

13:21.008 --> 13:22.760
As far as the people know,

13:22.843 --> 13:25.471
it could just as well be
a float in the Rose Parade, huh?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.140
(all laughing)

13:29.517 --> 13:33.437
Okay, Howard, for the benefit
of us deskbound types,

13:33.521 --> 13:35.189
let's see what this baby of yours can do.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.816
Thank you, Chief.

13:36.899 --> 13:37.983
(exhales)

13:38.067 --> 13:42.112
Powered by a 2,000-horsepower
Krupp-Grumman engine,

13:42.196 --> 13:46.826
armor-plated, equipped
with a 360-degree artillery turret,

13:46.909 --> 13:49.620
it has enough provisions
to sustain five personnel

13:49.703 --> 13:51.372
for 32 days of siege.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.416
Now, the Nishitsu is without equal

13:54.500 --> 13:57.837
in the current urban warfare technology.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.754
Gentlemen…

14:01.757 --> 14:02.758
the PANDA.

14:03.467 --> 14:07.221
-(appreciative murmuring)
-HUNTER: Thank you.

14:07.304 --> 14:10.558
Howard, that tubular projection
on the front, what's that for?

14:10.641 --> 14:11.600
(chuckles)

14:12.560 --> 14:13.561
(whooshing noise)

14:13.644 --> 14:15.896
(men gasping, exclaiming)

14:15.980 --> 14:17.273
Nice touch, Howard.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.400
Haven't seen one of those since Korea.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.819
Yes? There's what?

14:21.902 --> 14:24.822
Oh, I appreciate your discretion, Laurie,
but it wasn't necessary.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.909
Gentlemen, it seems
that they've had a slight 2-11 out front

14:28.993 --> 14:30.703
at the coffee shop a few seconds ago.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.289
But, but, but, but,
since units are on the way,

14:33.372 --> 14:35.666
and the suspects are long gone,

14:35.749 --> 14:37.877
I suggest we simply sit back down again

14:37.960 --> 14:40.045
and allow Howard to continue
his demonstration.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.215
The press, Chief.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.926
On second thought, um,

14:46.010 --> 14:49.680
I think a rear exit
would be advisable, gentlemen.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.640
Howard, get that stuff outta here.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.934
(comedy music playing)

15:06.655 --> 15:09.283
-Sorry…
-Lucy, pass these out, would you?

15:09.366 --> 15:14.288
Okay, now, each $1,000 you've invested

15:14.371 --> 15:17.082
represents one share
of Saloondromat, Incorporated,

15:17.166 --> 15:20.127
or 10% of the total capital outlay.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.128
Watch.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.298
Rachel and I were gonna use our grand

15:24.381 --> 15:28.636
as a deposit on that station wagon
she's always wanted.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.556
Yeah. I was gonna use mine
for my children's education.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.558
-Mm-hmm.
-(clears throat)

15:36.143 --> 15:39.688
-You don't have any children, Phil.
-No, not yet.

15:39.772 --> 15:44.151
But I've made a big decision
about my future. Big.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.613
This thing says $4,000 outlay!

15:48.072 --> 15:51.075
What Ray is saying is that,
where's the other $6,000?

15:51.158 --> 15:53.577
-Your figures are a little vague.
-That's right, where?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.664
Hey! What, am I dealing with
a bunch of amateurs here?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.790
(scoffs)

15:57.873 --> 16:00.960
Hey, you don't turn some pensioner's dive
into a Saloondromat

16:01.043 --> 16:03.087
with a couple of kegs of beer
and some Cheez-Its.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.673
You know, you gotta spend a little--
decor, liquor--

16:05.756 --> 16:08.175
not to mention
the washing machines, dryers,

16:08.258 --> 16:10.886
-utilities, girls, jukeboxes.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.513
-What?
-Girls?

16:13.430 --> 16:16.016
What girls, baby? Hmm?

16:17.434 --> 16:20.854
Do you really think our customers are
gonna want to do their laundry themselves?

16:20.938 --> 16:21.855
No way.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.482
And they're not gonna have to

16:23.565 --> 16:25.150
because we are gonna provide

16:25.234 --> 16:27.319
some dynamite foxes to help 'em.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.238
Bring 'em bleach, some detergent.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.198
Hey,
a little help with the fluff and fold.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.449
(laughter)

16:32.533 --> 16:34.326
-MAN 1: "Fluff and fold"?
-MAN 2: Come on!

16:34.410 --> 16:36.912
(solemn organ music playing)

16:47.256 --> 16:48.799
Straight through the doors, ma'am.

16:48.882 --> 16:54.054
It's the, uh, green-colored urn
on-- on the coffee table.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.642
I'm thrilled, Phil. Honest to God.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.440
(indistinct station chatter)

17:07.776 --> 17:10.612
But, uh, you know, kids, Phil--

17:10.696 --> 17:13.782
Kids are a big risk.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.577
I mean, you don't just leap into it
with both hands.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.913
Henry, I am hardly the leaping type.

17:20.706 --> 17:21.749
Nope.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.626
I have thought this over in depth--

17:25.961 --> 17:28.005
profound depth,

17:28.088 --> 17:30.215
deep depth.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.009
You'll excuse me for saying so,

17:32.092 --> 17:34.428
but you're no spring chicken, Phil.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.096
It's a hell of a risk.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.182
Life is a risk. What isn't?

17:38.265 --> 17:43.187
You know, a guy I know died two weeks ago
eating a club sandwich.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.397
Forgot to take out the toothpicks.

17:45.481 --> 17:51.070
Phil, there are risks,
and then there are serious risks.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.489
(exhales)

17:54.907 --> 17:59.328
I guess Grace knows that she's past
the prime childbearing years.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.539
-(scoffs): Henry!
-No, I'm talking statistics, Phil.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.374
Pure statistics on women over 40.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.252
Henry, we are not talking Grace.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.588
We are talking Cindy.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.382
-Cindy?
-Cindy.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.593
Cindy? But she's--

18:14.676 --> 18:17.346
Eighteen last week.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.973
But a very mature young lady.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.352
Oh, I'm sure she is, Phil.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.938
All I gotta do is break the news to Grace.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.607
(sighs)

18:29.441 --> 18:32.277
And after last night,
that might not be easy.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.154
Why? What happened last night?

18:35.572 --> 18:36.657
Oh.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.286
Well, I guess you could call it,
uh, the long good-bye.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.163
Mm.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.582
No, I guess you couldn't, huh?

18:47.292 --> 18:48.961
-Cindy?
-Yep.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.256
You know, I feel kind of guilty
that we never invited Marv

18:52.339 --> 18:54.007
to any of our Tuesday night poker games.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.511
Not to speak ill of the dead, Neal,
but he was boring. The dude was boring.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.263
Hey, I liked him as much as the next guy.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.307
But let's face it,
Marv was not Mr. Entertainment.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.354
What do you make of that?

19:07.437 --> 19:09.148
-(sobbing)
-If I didn't know better,

19:09.231 --> 19:13.861
I'd say that that boring dude
had something going for him.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.029
-Marv?
-Mm-hmm.

19:16.113 --> 19:20.075
No way. Impossible.
Got to be a distant relative.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.703
Oh, man, here we go

19:22.786 --> 19:23.745
again.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.124
(exhales, sniffles)

19:28.750 --> 19:30.252
(woman keeps sobbing)

19:34.381 --> 19:35.257
(exhales)

19:35.340 --> 19:38.302
I almost didn't make it through the day
when I found out about it.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.056
Marv and me were like that.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.185
He used to call me J.D.,

19:46.810 --> 19:48.770
and I called him Big M.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.691
-I had a nickname for him too.
-Yeah?

19:52.774 --> 19:56.445
-Biscuit. You know, after Seabiscuit?
-Hmm?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.906
That's the--
That's the name of the racehorse.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.574
(sobbing)

20:03.577 --> 20:08.123
(comedy music playing)

20:40.656 --> 20:41.615
(man laughing)

20:41.698 --> 20:45.869
-It steers like an absolute dream.
-(speaking Japanese)

20:54.378 --> 20:57.422
Damn good thing that Hirohito didn't have
one of these in '44, huh, guys?

20:57.506 --> 21:00.676
-Hirohito-- (speaking Japanese)
-That's not for translation, Webster.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.593
Oh. Sorry, sir.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.524
HUNTER:
We've got about 40 minutes to kill.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.109
What do you say we grab a bite to eat?

21:17.192 --> 21:18.777
I know a little place not far from here

21:18.860 --> 21:21.071
that'll make those little fellas
feel right at home.

21:21.154 --> 21:24.449
-(speaking Japanese)
-(speaking Japanese)

21:38.505 --> 21:40.424
(over speaker): <i>I'll park it myself.</i>

21:50.392 --> 21:51.310
WOMAN: Uh-oh.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.894
(thud)

21:52.978 --> 21:54.062
MAN: Ooh!

21:57.274 --> 22:00.485
(glass shattering)

22:30.098 --> 22:32.392
(speaking Japanese)

22:32.476 --> 22:34.978
(woman screams)

22:35.062 --> 22:37.189
Come on. We'll have a little bite to eat.

22:37.272 --> 22:40.484
-(woman shouting)
-VALET: I don't know what happened.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.694
They just came in and--
I don't know! I don't know!

22:42.778 --> 22:45.280
(woman keeps shouting in Japanese)

22:45.364 --> 22:48.158
Ask them. I don't know. They came in and…

22:48.241 --> 22:51.703
(shouting in Japanese)

22:51.787 --> 22:53.538
They just came in and…

22:53.622 --> 22:54.623
We will call the police.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.334
-You wait here.
-Uh, Webster,

22:57.417 --> 22:59.795
exchange the necessary information
with her, will you?

22:59.878 --> 23:01.463
-Yes, sir.
-Uh…

23:02.005 --> 23:04.466
Let's do a run on her immigration status
while we're at it.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.135
-Yes, sir.
-Come on, little guy.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.970
-I'm gonna take care of it.
-No! No!

23:09.054 --> 23:10.097
WEBSTER: <i>Gomen nasai.</i>

23:10.180 --> 23:11.181
Phil!

23:15.519 --> 23:18.730
I've got over a dozen
more applications for transfer here.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.149
Fifteen, to be precise, Francis.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.736
Well, at this rate,
we may as well all pack up and leave.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.239
Hmm? The thought has crossed my mind.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.576
Phil, will you talk to these people?

23:32.202 --> 23:34.538
I can't process
over 75 requests for transfer.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.081
They'll think we're nuts.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.249
As you wish, Francis,

23:37.332 --> 23:39.584
not that I guarantee it'll do any good.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.254
They figure if you leave, why stay?

23:46.842 --> 23:50.345
Oh, I take it Midtown has sent up
that tape of Fay's obscene phone call.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.348
Yeah, I took the liberty of borrowing this
from Henry's desk.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.226
MAN (on speaker):
<i>That's right, baby. You heard me.</i>

23:57.060 --> 24:00.772
<i>Peanut butter-- all up and down your body.</i>

24:02.232 --> 24:03.733
<i>You know you love it.</i>

24:03.817 --> 24:05.735
<i>You know you need it.</i>

24:05.819 --> 24:07.028
(gasping)

24:07.112 --> 24:11.116
<i>Wow! I'm getting really turned on, baby,</i>

24:11.199 --> 24:14.119
<i>and I-- I ain't even talking jelly yet.</i>

24:17.247 --> 24:20.125
(speaking Japanese)

24:20.208 --> 24:22.043
They liked it, huh? Good.

24:22.127 --> 24:26.047
You know, there's nothing like raw fish
to build up the nucleic acids, huh?

24:26.131 --> 24:29.634
-(translating)
-(men laugh)

24:29.718 --> 24:32.721
Why, I remember when I was stationed

24:32.804 --> 24:36.683
in the Philippines
for several weeks in '58.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.394
-(translating)
-There were several…

24:41.980 --> 24:45.484
(speaking Japanese)

24:46.568 --> 24:49.321
-What is he saying, Webster?
-Mr. Okino humbly inquires,

24:49.404 --> 24:50.572
with all due respect, sir,

24:50.655 --> 24:52.991
whether you may have left
the keys in the ignition.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.869
Now, just a moment here. Ahem.

24:56.661 --> 25:00.248
Do I look like the sort of man
who would leave the keys

25:00.332 --> 25:03.293
in the ignition
of a six-million-dollar assault tank?

25:03.376 --> 25:05.128
Why, I've got 'em right here.

25:05.212 --> 25:09.508
Right-- Right in my, uh-- my…

25:11.092 --> 25:12.260
(horn honks)

25:15.096 --> 25:16.640
Let's make it quick, babe.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.351
This Saloondromat's cutting into
our workday enough as it is.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.853
Relax, man. I just wanna see
how she looks over the bar.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.105
Huh? I think
she'd look better behind bars.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.149
You know, you might know
a lot about a lot, Neal,

25:26.233 --> 25:29.069
but when it comes to serious art,
you got a terrible deficiency.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.737
Yeah, sure, sure.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.739
Geez.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.369
(indistinct station chatter)

25:46.002 --> 25:48.255
You wanna hang yourself career-wise,
be my guest.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.548
Just don't take me with you.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.049
Hello, Emil.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.929
You're beating a dead horse, Frank.

25:56.012 --> 25:59.099
Nobody's gonna believe that McAurley was
putting it to that Rivas girl,

25:59.182 --> 26:01.518
especially not after what he said
on TV the other night.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.603
Oh, yeah, that was a nice soft shoe.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.773
Compares favorably
with the Checkers speech.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.359
Why don't you just let it the hell be?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.987
Because somebody's got to tell
the truth about this, Emil,

26:12.070 --> 26:13.989
since neither you
nor the D.A. seems willing.

26:14.072 --> 26:17.033
Look, at the bottom line,
Rodriguez pulled that trigger.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.785
We both know that.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.413
What difference is
dragging McAurley into it gonna make?

26:21.496 --> 26:25.792
A lot. As in the difference, for instance,
between manslaughter and murder one.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.169
(laughs): Rodriguez?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.548
Listen, believe me,
whatever that kid gets, he's got coming.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.759
I've been cleaning up after dirt like that
for 27 years, Frank.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.429
Oh, Emil, that's no answer.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.724
Surely we've got more morality than that.

26:40.807 --> 26:43.852
Don't you preach at me, Frank.
You wanna talk morality?

26:43.935 --> 26:46.354
Where's the morality in ruining
a good man like McAurley?

26:46.896 --> 26:49.190
McAurley? Oh, yeah. He's a prince.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.612
You be sure to stop me,
Emil, if I'm wrong.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.156
What we have here

26:56.239 --> 26:58.867
is a married man with two kids,

26:58.950 --> 27:03.163
involved in what amounts to
repeated statutory rape of a juvenile

27:03.246 --> 27:06.875
while paying dues to a teenage sex club.

27:06.958 --> 27:11.379
Emil, you're the best Homicide detective
this city's ever had,

27:12.422 --> 27:14.966
and yet you're about to flush it all away,

27:15.050 --> 27:17.093
covering up at the very least

27:17.177 --> 27:19.471
the massive indiscretions
of a public official.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.222
That's not you, Emil.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.268
-There has to be a reason.
-(knocking)

27:26.269 --> 27:28.396
Excuse me, Francis.
Sam Ecker's on the line.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.691
It seems Midtown has caught up
with Fay's obscene caller.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.069
Oh, thanks, Phil.
Ask him to wait a minute, would you?

27:34.152 --> 27:37.113
Will do. How goes the war, Emil?

27:37.197 --> 27:39.991
-Feeling the years, Phil.
-Indeed.

27:40.075 --> 27:44.579
Each passing one a sad reminder
of opportunity lost, progeny-wise.

27:55.048 --> 27:58.426
Phone the D.A.'s office, Emil,
and get a subpoena for McAurley.

27:59.469 --> 28:00.428
Or what?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.555
Or be prepared for a lot of phone calls.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.057
Because if you don't,

28:04.140 --> 28:06.101
you know I have
only one other alternative,

28:06.184 --> 28:07.519
and that's to go public.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.438
That's crazy. That's suicide, Frank.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.024
You take this outside, you're finished.
You know that.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.318
You gonna call Swanson or do I?

28:22.534 --> 28:23.827
(door opens)

28:27.414 --> 28:28.873
(punches button)

28:29.874 --> 28:30.834
Yeah, Sam?

28:31.918 --> 28:34.379
Right. Phil told me. Great collar.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.673
Yeah, Fay'll be enormously…

28:38.299 --> 28:40.009
Run that by me again, Sam.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.513
Do me the favor, Sam,
and just hold on to him.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.307
-I'll get back to you.
-(receiver clatters)

28:46.391 --> 28:49.394
Uh, Frank, you remember Harvey.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.730
Fay, that was Ecker.

28:51.813 --> 28:55.900
He tells me you're reluctant
to press charges against this creep.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.612
Well, perhaps I can shed some light
on the subject, Frank.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.407
Okay, either one of you, start talking.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.409
The fact is that we've decided

29:04.492 --> 29:06.703
not to press charges
on the man that was arrested.

29:06.786 --> 29:09.289
What the hell does that mean, "we"?

29:10.623 --> 29:12.751
This man that you arrested

29:12.834 --> 29:15.420
happens to be a patient of mine

29:15.503 --> 29:17.714
who evidently developed some kind

29:17.797 --> 29:20.884
of an audio-libidinal obsession for Fay

29:20.967 --> 29:23.928
as a result
of her working in my office for me.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.681
Our prosecution of him would constitute

29:26.765 --> 29:30.059
a serious breach
of the confidentiality doctrine

29:30.143 --> 29:33.688
that is implicit in the relationship
between a doctor and his patient--

29:33.772 --> 29:37.484
Don't talk confidentiality to me, Doctor.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.862
You're a shrink and I'm a cop,
and neither one of us is a lawyer.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.406
What I'm trying to say, Frank,

29:43.490 --> 29:45.784
is that the man is essentially harmless.

29:45.867 --> 29:49.120
The man is a dangerous psycho

29:49.204 --> 29:52.957
who breached the security
of my wife's and child's home!

29:53.041 --> 29:55.376
In their absence, Frank.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.963
-He knew that the house was empty.
-Oh, really?

29:59.047 --> 30:03.718
Well, maybe you'd like to look
at some photographs of my wife's bed

30:03.802 --> 30:06.221
after this crazy got his kicks on it.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.349
A bed, I understand,
you're more than passing familiar with.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.477
-I don't think that's germane, Frank.
-You don't?

30:13.853 --> 30:16.564
Well, then, perhaps a tape recording

30:16.648 --> 30:19.859
of your audio-libidinal slime bag

30:19.943 --> 30:22.695
threatening to tie her up
with bungee cords!

30:24.155 --> 30:27.325
I realize the distress
this man has caused.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.453
I'm not minimizing
that aspect of the situation.

30:31.538 --> 30:34.833
Frank, see, Harvey feels

30:34.916 --> 30:36.417
that if we prosecute this man,

30:36.501 --> 30:38.211
we could set his therapy back two years.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.380
FURILLO: Oh, really!

30:40.463 --> 30:42.507
A lot of good it's done him so far!

30:42.590 --> 30:44.676
-(ringing)
-Yes?

30:46.135 --> 30:48.805
-As soon as I can, Dave.
-DAVE: <i>I want you over here now!</i>

30:48.888 --> 30:49.931
Look, Commander--

30:50.014 --> 30:52.517
DAVE: <i>I want you here now, right away!</i>

30:52.600 --> 30:54.519
<i>-You understand?</i>
-Yeah, I'll be right there.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.271
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-I said I'd be right there.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.438
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

31:01.568 --> 31:04.612
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
Uh, could we talk, Fay?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.240
For just a minute? Alone?

31:09.158 --> 31:10.827
Harvey, wait outside.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.122
-Please?
-As always, Frank.

31:21.671 --> 31:22.922
(exhales)

31:25.800 --> 31:28.052
Fay, I honestly believe that

31:28.136 --> 31:29.888
any man who could do what this…

31:31.389 --> 31:35.643
animal has done to you
is capable of worse.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.186
You've got to press charges.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.064
Oh, I don't know, Frank.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.358
I mean, Harvey is the expert,

31:42.442 --> 31:45.445
and he feels
that the man's not likely to do it again.

31:45.528 --> 31:46.779
That's not good enough.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.489
I don't want you to take the chance.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.117
Well, he's staking his reputation on it.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.745
I don't give a damn
about Harvey's reputation.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.916
What I do care about is, is yours
and Frank Jr.'s safety,

31:57.999 --> 31:59.918
and I won't tolerate you being blackmailed

32:00.001 --> 32:02.295
into doing something you know is wrong.

32:02.378 --> 32:06.257
Oh, that sort of judgment
is very easy for you, isn't it, Frank?

32:06.341 --> 32:09.385
I mean, after all, you're out there,
free as a bird.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.095
Well, what the hell does that have to do

32:11.179 --> 32:13.556
with pressing charges
against an obscene phone caller?

32:13.640 --> 32:16.601
I'm going to be 37 years old, Frank,

32:17.143 --> 32:19.854
one of these days,
and I'm just a little scared.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.397
Oh, Fay.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.858
I mean, how many Harveys
do you think are out there?

32:23.942 --> 32:28.237
You're an intelligent, attractive woman
with a great deal to offer.

32:28.321 --> 32:32.325
Sure, you see it, I see it,

32:32.408 --> 32:34.410
but the rest of the world
sees a middle-aged lady

32:34.494 --> 32:36.996
in a low-paying job
with an eight-year-old kid

32:37.080 --> 32:38.998
and a swell set of stretch marks.

32:44.879 --> 32:49.592
Please, take yourself over to Midtown
and file charges.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.970
You'll sleep better,
Frank Jr. will sleep better,

32:52.053 --> 32:53.471
and I'll sleep better.

32:53.554 --> 32:57.225
And if you lose Harvey over this,
which, by the way, I doubt,

32:57.308 --> 32:59.435
he wasn't worth holding onto
in the first place.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.854
Okay?

33:03.439 --> 33:04.399
Okay.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.238
But if I lose him over this,
you have to take me back.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.825
What? A middle-aged woman
with stretch marks?

33:13.908 --> 33:15.118
(chuckles): Oh, you!

33:18.913 --> 33:19.998
(sighs)

33:20.498 --> 33:22.709
(indistinct station chatter)

33:29.090 --> 33:33.636
Oh, Mick, it seems we've been just missing
each other all day.

33:34.929 --> 33:37.974
Did you get a chance to look
at my transfer request yet, Captain?

33:38.057 --> 33:41.060
Yeah, I did. I'll be back in an hour
or so. We can talk about it, okay?

33:45.940 --> 33:51.195
Uh, Mick, you don't really wanna move
downtown to Narcotics, do you?

33:51.279 --> 33:52.488
Sure. Why not?

33:53.531 --> 33:56.534
Lots of action down there, long hours.

33:56.617 --> 33:59.454
Most of them in the dark, which I prefer.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.622
Plus you got a better chance
of getting killed.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.875
Not that it's got anything
to do with your leaving,

34:03.958 --> 34:06.544
'cause it's got nothing
to do with that whatsoever.

34:08.421 --> 34:11.674
Is there something on your mind,
dog drool?

34:11.758 --> 34:13.009
Come on! Move!

34:17.722 --> 34:20.475
Everything I lay my hands on
turns to human deficit

34:20.558 --> 34:22.060
right in front of my eyes.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.396
How could they tear my Saloondromat down?

34:26.189 --> 34:29.067
-WASHINGTON: Must've had a city permit.
-I don't care!

34:30.610 --> 34:32.111
I don't care, Neal.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.530
I just don't care anymore.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.949
Hey, you can't win 'em all, J.D.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.117
(laughs)

34:38.201 --> 34:41.037
Win… Win 'em all? I wanna win one!

34:42.663 --> 34:45.291
I know, babe. I know.

34:46.959 --> 34:49.212
Ah, they've finally done it, man.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.840
They have finally broken me.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.219
DAVE: Okay, Frank, we'll put the counselor
aside for the moment.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.012
The fact is, if you do go public,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.765
you're gonna create some serious problems
for the department,

35:00.848 --> 35:03.101
not to mention what it'll do
to your commandership.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.812
Oh, Dave, maybe I should just
take myself out of the running.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.397
I'm gonna do you a big favor, Frank,
and forget you said that.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.191
I'll give you some time to think about it.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.361
I have thought about it
for three weeks, Dave.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.488
Three weeks of breakfasts with the chief,

35:15.571 --> 35:17.281
divisional backslapping

35:17.365 --> 35:20.785
and political club sodas
with the boys at Madigan's.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.454
Maybe it's a stupid career move.
I don't know.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.873
But the truth is,
I'm not sure I want that job.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.417
Not if it means going in there
every day with blinders on.

35:28.501 --> 35:31.045
You're forgetting
who put your name in the hat, Frank--

35:31.129 --> 35:34.340
who's been politicking for you
for months-- me!

35:34.423 --> 35:37.593
I'm really sorry about that, Dave,
and I'd make it up to you if I could.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.893
You go all the way on this,

35:45.977 --> 35:48.813
you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in the Hill. You know that.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.189
It's a hell of a waste, Frank.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.191
I hate to see it happen.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.485
Are you gonna bring McAurley in or do I?

35:55.611 --> 35:57.321
You don't give me much choice.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.327
RENKO: I'm telling you, if he would've
kept us on that Rivas murder,

36:03.411 --> 36:05.788
we could've gotten into Homicide
through the back door…

36:05.872 --> 36:07.999
If you're so damned anxious
to be wearing a suit,

36:08.082 --> 36:10.543
I could easily recommend
some brokerage houses, Renko.

36:10.626 --> 36:12.587
Let me tell you,
I just might take you up on that.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.797
-We're cops, man! Street cops.
-I'm aware of that.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.674
The only thing these blues
have done for me

36:16.757 --> 36:19.677
is give me free coffee refills
and an occasional bullet wound.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.803
(police radio chatter)

36:20.887 --> 36:22.930
I'm so tired of working here
and not being…

36:23.014 --> 36:24.223
(horn honking)

36:24.307 --> 36:27.059
Shut up! Horn blowers.
I hate that. Back up.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.562
-Would you relax?
-Just back up. I hate that!

36:29.645 --> 36:32.148
WOMAN (over police radio):
<i>Suspect vehicle is late-model,</i>

36:32.231 --> 36:33.566
<i>yellow, four-door sedan.</i>

36:33.649 --> 36:35.735
<i>Last seen northbound</i>
<i>on Dekker from location.</i>

36:35.818 --> 36:38.237
-Late-model yellow Ford.
<i>-Stand by for further alerts.</i>

36:38.321 --> 36:40.698
Oh, Lord,
just what I need to settle my lunch.

36:40.781 --> 36:46.037
-(tires screeching)
-(siren wailing)

36:46.120 --> 36:49.123
Okay, out of the car with your hands up
in the air so we can see 'em, now!

36:50.458 --> 36:52.960
Doesn't look like no white boy to me--
armed and dangerous.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.297
All right, <i>compadre.</i> Now, look,
just put your hands up against the car.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.507
-(speaking Spanish)
-Don't talk.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.009
Put your hands against the car.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.428
Do me a favor. What is he jabbering about?

37:02.511 --> 37:03.763
-I don't know.
-(woman moans)

37:03.846 --> 37:05.848
Would you shut up, please?
<i>Silencio, por favor!</i>

37:05.932 --> 37:07.266
-Oh, my goodness!
-(moaning)

37:07.350 --> 37:09.352
Sir, I apologize.
We'll put you in this car

37:09.435 --> 37:11.896
and give you a police escort
down to St. John's Hospital.

37:11.979 --> 37:14.065
<i>-Policía "escorto."</i>
-We're not going anywhere.

37:14.148 --> 37:17.193
-Bobby, the woman's gonna have a baby.
-The woman is having a baby.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.737
-All right, I'll get the medical kit.
-We don't have time.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.615
-Just get in the other side--
-Bobby, I can't-- Uh-uh.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.493
-Get in the other side and hold her still.
-Get in the car.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.829
-HILL: Okay, hold her shoulders.
-(woman shouts in Spanish)

37:28.913 --> 37:31.165
-RENKO: All right, mama.
-HILL: It's okay. It's okay.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.251
-HILL: Are we okay?
-Relax and be real quiet now.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.336
-You're supposed to breathe.
-Breathe deeply.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.171
-(woman breathing heavily)
-Like that?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.965
HILL: Good. Now, I want you to push.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.092
-Push. That's good.
-RENKO: Just like that.

37:41.175 --> 37:43.386
-(praying in Spanish)
-(woman shouting)

37:43.469 --> 37:44.720
RENKO: What are you gonna do?

37:44.804 --> 37:48.432
HILL: I'm gonna try to turn
the baby's shoulders.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.893
-(moaning)
-Push! Push!

37:50.977 --> 37:52.478
-(woman shouting)
-You hold on.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.563
Don't you worry.
Just keep saying your prayers.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.900
-(woman groaning in Spanish)
-HILL: Push! Push! Push!

37:57.984 --> 38:00.653
-I'm just gonna try to turn the shoulders.
-RENKO: Oh my Lord!

38:00.736 --> 38:05.157
Push! Push! Okay, okay! Here it comes!

38:05.241 --> 38:07.743
Real hard! Real hard! There it goes!

38:07.827 --> 38:10.329
-(moaning)
-(baby crying)

38:10.413 --> 38:12.915
HILL: Hi. How ya doing? Oh!

38:12.999 --> 38:15.126
Look, it's a dude! It's a dude!

38:16.043 --> 38:18.421
<i>Señor, su hijo.</i>

38:19.547 --> 38:22.216
Oh, look at this.
How you doing, little fella?

38:22.925 --> 38:24.343
You all right there, mama?

38:24.427 --> 38:27.221
(theme music playing)

38:42.862 --> 38:44.488
Good of you to break away, Counselor.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.741
I'm a good kid. What's going on?

38:46.824 --> 38:48.242
Rodriguez in there?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.785
They're bringing him down now.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.662
Uh, do you mind? I thought you quit.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.248
I wasn't smoking it. I was holding it.
What are we doing here?

38:54.332 --> 38:57.418
We're gonna make an honest felon
out of Nemo Rodriguez.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.879
Speaking of whom.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.469
I'll be right in, Nemo.

39:11.098 --> 39:15.186
Aside from hating my guts,
he fired me this morning.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.524
He thinks a male public defender
would've been more effective.

39:22.151 --> 39:25.404
I'd write it off to Latin attitude
if every other male defendant

39:25.488 --> 39:27.907
didn't share that feeling
to one degree or another.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.409
I'm sorry. You were saying?

39:31.702 --> 39:34.497
I just did half an hour with Swanson.
It's what we thought.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.540
The councilman was there when it happened?

39:36.624 --> 39:37.583
Yep.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.210
And Swanson'll testify to that?

39:39.293 --> 39:40.711
He doesn't have to.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.588
McAurley's coming in voluntarily.

39:42.671 --> 39:45.674
With the department bailing out,
he doesn't have much choice.

39:45.758 --> 39:46.592
What about you?

39:47.593 --> 39:48.511
What about me?

39:48.594 --> 39:50.012
What'd it cost you, Furillo?

39:58.813 --> 40:00.106
See ya, Davenport.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.974
McAurley was slapping the girl around,

40:35.057 --> 40:37.393
and the kid aimed at him and hit her,
simple as that.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.229
Lousy aim with a lousy gun.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.398
And who took the jewelry? The aunt, right?

40:42.481 --> 40:45.276
Yeah. She squirreled it away someplace

40:45.359 --> 40:46.986
waiting for it to cool off.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.572
Life on the Hill, huh, Frank?

40:49.655 --> 40:53.367
-You did know this from day one.
-Not all of it.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.745
They told me just what they thought
I needed to know.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.539
-Who's "they"?
-Oh, come on, Frank.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.082
Let's not play that game.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.840
I'm very sorry, Frank.

41:07.923 --> 41:09.842
I'm sorrier about this
than I think you know.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.347
Who'd have thought
it would mushroom like this?

41:17.808 --> 41:21.145
I still have to know why, Emil. Why you?

41:21.228 --> 41:23.397
You've been the best going for 30 years.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.942
The best. (chuckles)

41:27.026 --> 41:28.277
Whatever the hell that means.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.654
Please, Emil, why?

41:30.738 --> 41:31.822
Who'd you owe?

41:37.912 --> 41:40.998
A couple of years ago,
I had a little heart problem, Frank.

41:42.958 --> 41:45.377
Ah, hell, I got a bad heart, Frank.

41:46.378 --> 41:47.880
I wouldn't be here today

41:48.631 --> 41:52.176
if certain people hadn't
been looking the other way.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.552
Good people!

41:53.636 --> 41:54.929
Good solid people.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.390
What was I supposed to do?
McAurley didn't kill anybody.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.685
Because he got involved
in some kinky 15-year-old action?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.354
That's not my problem.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.105
You don't say no because of that.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.233
Not after what they done for me.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.236
Oh, Emil, that's not nearly good enough.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.905
Not after what you did
to that kid back there.

42:12.988 --> 42:15.241
And you know what's good enough,
huh, Frank?

42:17.326 --> 42:19.787
What are you, 39, 40?

42:24.333 --> 42:26.377
I'm 55 years old, Frank.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.797
All I know is being a cop.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.676
That's all I've been my whole life.

42:35.469 --> 42:37.429
Take that away from me,
what am I gonna do?

42:39.098 --> 42:41.475
Sit on a park bench feeding the ducks?

42:42.309 --> 42:44.228
That favor gave me
three more years, Frank,

42:44.311 --> 42:46.188
so don't you say
that it wasn't good enough,

42:46.272 --> 42:47.398
'cause you don't know.

42:48.524 --> 42:49.817
See you around, Emil.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.112
I'm sorry, Frank.

42:53.195 --> 42:56.282
I never meant for it to hurt you,
believe me.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.244
I know.

43:04.456 --> 43:06.584
Would you tell Mr. Fitzgerald
I'd like to be there

43:06.667 --> 43:08.002
when Mr. McAurley comes in?

43:09.003 --> 43:09.920
I'll hold.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.340
It's gonna be okay, kid.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.385
I don't care. Who cares, huh?

43:17.511 --> 43:18.846
You'd be surprised.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.568
WOMAN: Hill Street Station.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.070
Yes, would you hold, please?

43:39.700 --> 43:41.535
All right, gentlemen. (clears throat)

43:41.619 --> 43:45.331
Here, here, and, uh, here.

43:45.414 --> 43:48.584
You'll deploy your squads
and go building to building.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.544
The rain is on our side cover-wise.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.713
Uh, Webster, ixnay.

43:52.796 --> 43:56.133
-What?
-Ix-- Ixnay-- Excuse me. (forced chuckle)

43:56.216 --> 43:57.593
Disembowelment, man.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.220
Judas, I thought you understood
the Oriental mind.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.598
Hara-kiri is a way of life over there.

44:02.681 --> 44:03.515
Yes, sir.

44:03.599 --> 44:08.771
Now, then, we will move
squad number three into…

44:08.854 --> 44:11.231
Wait a minute. This is the Dekker Avenue--

44:11.315 --> 44:14.401
Howard, would you mind
telling me what's going on?

44:14.485 --> 44:16.195
What's with the armored vans out there?

44:16.278 --> 44:17.905
There must be a hundred men out there.

44:17.988 --> 44:19.698
Let's try not to panic, Frank.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.659
If you had bothered to count,
you would find

44:21.742 --> 44:24.328
that there are nine squads,
which is 90 men.

44:24.411 --> 44:26.372
Oh, that makes
all the difference in the world.

44:26.455 --> 44:27.539
What's going on, Howard?

44:27.623 --> 44:29.458
It's lock-and-load time, Frank.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.419
We are launching
a major offensive on Sniper Alley.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.671
They've got the PANDA.

44:34.505 --> 44:35.923
If you had been here,

44:36.006 --> 44:38.842
you would have known
that those sociopathic little cockroaches

44:38.926 --> 44:41.387
have just called
with a ransom demand one hour ago.

44:41.887 --> 44:45.099
And if you had been listening
to your police band, Howard,

44:45.182 --> 44:47.309
instead of launching an offensive,

44:47.393 --> 44:50.729
you'd know that they found your tank
an hour and a half ago.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.981
-Where?
-In the East River.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.362
The East River?

44:59.613 --> 45:00.698
Stripped.

45:03.742 --> 45:04.702
Stripped?

45:05.786 --> 45:06.954
And gutted.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.464
-(applause)
-Hey!

45:20.092 --> 45:21.427
Congratulations.

45:24.388 --> 45:27.641
-I see news travels fast.
-Well, good news, Francis.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.102
For us anyway. I hope for you, too.

45:30.185 --> 45:33.480
Oh. I appreciate the thought.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.943
Is Belker here?
He wanted to talk to me, didn't he, Phil?

45:38.026 --> 45:40.195
He's downstairs, Captain,
sleeping like a baby.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.364
-Oh. Thanks.
-(chuckling)

45:43.907 --> 45:45.868
Well, what say we hit it?

45:45.951 --> 45:47.745
We've got an hour on the clock yet.

45:47.828 --> 45:50.330
-Mm-hmm. All right.
-WOMAN: Such a relief.

45:50.414 --> 45:54.001
Uh, Ray, I'm really sorry for your sake.

45:54.084 --> 45:56.211
I know you would've gotten the captaincy.

45:56.295 --> 45:57.421
That's all right, Frank.

45:57.504 --> 45:59.715
I didn't stand a chance in hell.

46:00.924 --> 46:02.176
Thanks anyway.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.853
He was a-- a very giving person, Marv.

46:13.979 --> 46:17.900
Yeah, he gave and gave and gave.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.111
Boy, could he give.

46:27.618 --> 46:28.869
This yours, Henry?

46:30.871 --> 46:31.872
Yeah.

46:33.499 --> 46:36.168
You mind just, uh-- Put it on my desk.

46:39.338 --> 46:40.172
Okay?

46:41.673 --> 46:42.549
(sighs)

46:42.633 --> 46:43.592
Leo,

46:45.761 --> 46:49.890
J.D. thinks we need to call
an emergency stockholders' meeting.

46:51.433 --> 46:54.895
(sad music playing)

47:04.738 --> 47:06.657
MAN (whistles): Taxi! Over here!

47:30.806 --> 47:32.224
(horn honking)

47:36.353 --> 47:38.021
-Sorry I'm late.
-Hi.

47:38.730 --> 47:40.816
I had some last-minute phone calls
at the office.

47:40.899 --> 47:43.110
(sighs): Oh, yeah, I'll bet you did.

47:44.111 --> 47:45.821
It's already made the papers.

47:51.535 --> 47:52.953
It's curious, isn't it?

47:53.036 --> 47:54.663
McAurley and I have never met.

47:54.746 --> 47:57.749
I've only seen the guy once
in that television broadcast.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.919
Yet, somehow, we've managed
to derail each other's lives.

48:03.005 --> 48:05.173
Reminds me of the elephant
and the ant joke.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.551
The what?

48:07.634 --> 48:10.679
You know, the elephant and the ant
spend the night making love.

48:10.762 --> 48:13.056
(chuckles): Now, wait, wait.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.350
And the next morning,
the ant wakes up to discover

48:15.434 --> 48:16.685
the elephant has died.

48:16.768 --> 48:18.145
"Damn it," says the ant,

48:18.770 --> 48:19.938
"One night of passion,

48:20.022 --> 48:22.399
and I spend the rest of my life
digging a grave."

48:22.900 --> 48:24.568
(laughing): Oh, no!

48:25.611 --> 48:27.571
It's a good thing
we're both still laughing.

48:27.654 --> 48:29.615
(both laughing)

48:39.750 --> 48:43.211
(theme music playing)
