WEBVTT

00:08.380 --> 00:10.207
Time, Mr Data?

00:11.300 --> 00:15.049
We will be in transporter range
in three minutes 21 seconds.

00:15.179 --> 00:18.014
Finally established audio contact
with the Romulans.

00:18.141 --> 00:21.640
Main power is failing.
No way to stop the overload.

00:21.770 --> 00:25.554
Enterprise to Romulan vessel.
We are en route to your position.

00:25.690 --> 00:28.182
Enterprise, what is your
time of arrival?

00:29.903 --> 00:32.061
Repeat your last transmission.

00:33.824 --> 00:35.484
Sorry, Captain. They stopped.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.943
- Picard to Riker.
- Riker here.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.700
Transport to the Romulan ship
when in range.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.367
Aye, sir. No weapons.
They are not under attack.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.873
- This is not a bright idea.
- I beg your pardon?

00:50.008 --> 00:53.876
- I didn't quite catch that.
- Nothing, sir.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.537 --> 01:20.286
- All thrusters shut down.
- Your information is unreliable.

01:20.416 --> 01:22.705
The AH is inoperative.

01:30.469 --> 01:32.094
Give me a hand here.

01:44.359 --> 01:47.977
We're from the Starship Enterprise.
We received your distress call.

01:48.989 --> 01:52.607
- The Enterprise?
- A failure in your engine core?

01:52.785 --> 01:56.997
Yes. We had a forced chamber
explosion in the resonator coil.

01:58.458 --> 02:02.954
A strange set-up, but I'd say the
graviton generator is depolarised.

02:03.088 --> 02:07.251
There's no way to fix it.
It'll have to be replaced.

02:08.551 --> 02:11.506
- Where are your replicators?
- Off line.

02:11.638 --> 02:14.260
- Who's in charge?
- The Captain is dead.

02:14.391 --> 02:16.100
I am Science Officer Mirok.

02:16.227 --> 02:19.145
We'd like to take this
for replication.

02:19.731 --> 02:21.973
- Alright.
- Geordi, you and Ro.

02:26.071 --> 02:29.357
La Forge. Two people
and one piece of equipment.

02:29.491 --> 02:31.567
Aye, sir.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.284
What the hell...?

02:40.962 --> 02:44.165
Engineering,
more power to the energising coil.

02:48.762 --> 02:52.096
Brossmer to Riker.
I'm losing them. I have to abort.

02:52.224 --> 02:55.178
They should be returning
to your coordinates.

02:59.482 --> 03:02.602
Chief, do you have them?
They're not here.

03:02.735 --> 03:05.856
- No, sir.
- Where are they?

03:06.448 --> 03:08.322
I can't locate their patterns.

03:09.743 --> 03:11.985
We've lost them, sir.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.736
Space, the final frontier.

03:46.366 --> 03:49.570
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.990
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

03:55.751 --> 03:59.002
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

04:00.465 --> 04:04.214
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:02.156 --> 05:05.692
I've done all I can, sir.
I'm afraid they're gone.

05:05.827 --> 05:10.703
Mr Data, begin a level-one
diagnostic. All transporters off.

05:12.459 --> 05:14.915
Could they have materialised
somewhere else?

05:15.045 --> 05:18.996
Negative. The sensors cannot locate
them within transporter range.

05:19.133 --> 05:20.296
Counsellor?

05:25.348 --> 05:27.840
- Riker to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.976
Captain, we're still looking
at a core breach.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.894
I need replacement personnel.

05:36.027 --> 05:39.396
Mr Data, continue the diagnostic
at another time.

05:39.530 --> 05:42.697
Take a shuttle and two engineers
to the Romulan ship.

05:42.826 --> 05:48.829
Mr McDowell, have all ships
and shuttle pilots standing by.

05:48.957 --> 05:53.287
Ensign. Lay in a course
away from Romulan vessel.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.750
Engage warp one if you detect
any sign it may explode.

06:10.022 --> 06:13.936
Pressure in the containment chamber
is increasing.

06:14.068 --> 06:17.935
- What do we do to stop overload?
- The conduits are damaged.

06:18.072 --> 06:21.441
- I can't even access the computer.
- Commander?

06:24.537 --> 06:27.574
Emergency bulkheads
have sealed off the rest of the ship.

06:27.707 --> 06:31.575
There is no way to gain access
to the control centres.

06:31.712 --> 06:33.087
Survivors?

06:33.213 --> 06:36.464
Readings indicate at least
73 Romulans are still alive.

06:37.301 --> 06:38.796
73?

06:43.933 --> 06:47.350
- The pressure has jumped.
- I can't control the chamber.

06:47.479 --> 06:51.014
- It's going to implode.
- Auto-eject the engine core.

06:51.150 --> 06:55.064
- I'll have to do it manually.
- Mr Worf, seal the chamber.

07:02.662 --> 07:05.070
Implosion will occur in one minute.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.780
Enterprise, we need to jettison
the engine core.

07:07.918 --> 07:10.326
You'll need to extend the shields.

07:10.462 --> 07:12.918
Understood. We'll stand by
for your signal.

07:35.948 --> 07:38.155
We must get the doors closed.

07:43.581 --> 07:44.577
Commander.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.283
- Time?
- 30 seconds.

08:00.183 --> 08:02.472
- I'm ready, Commander.
- Stay there.

08:02.602 --> 08:06.730
- Eject the chamber on my order.
- Excuse me, sir.

08:17.368 --> 08:19.325
Implosion in five seconds.

08:20.246 --> 08:21.361
Now.

08:26.878 --> 08:28.538
Enterprise, extend shields.

08:39.892 --> 08:42.644
- We're still here.
- Yes.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.779
We'll have a power survey
in an hour.

08:50.904 --> 08:55.483
We'll have to supply them
with life support and a new engine.

08:56.118 --> 08:59.570
Understood.
Keep me informed. Picard out.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.078
- I'll be in sickbay.
- Aye, sir.

09:30.572 --> 09:32.898
Ensign Ro to the bridge.

09:34.451 --> 09:35.910
This is Ensign Ro.

09:36.036 --> 09:39.904
I'm at... section 23 Baker,
near sickbay.

09:46.214 --> 09:47.958
Sickbay.

10:16.747 --> 10:19.285
Excuse me, I need some help...

10:24.172 --> 10:26.081
Excuse me.

10:27.342 --> 10:29.382
Excuse me, I need some help...

10:32.264 --> 10:34.755
Excuse me! I need some help.

10:45.236 --> 10:47.609
We shouldn't make hasty decisions.

10:48.573 --> 10:51.278
The transporter could have beamed
them somewhere.

10:51.410 --> 10:53.866
The Romulan ship,
another deck here.

10:53.996 --> 10:56.487
We've checked
all those possibilities.

10:56.624 --> 10:58.782
The initial findings seem to indicate

10:58.918 --> 11:02.417
that there was a radiation surge
which disrupted the signal.

11:02.547 --> 11:04.255
They never re-materialised.

11:04.382 --> 11:08.214
- We should check again.
- We've done everything we can.

11:12.141 --> 11:17.218
You're right. I just hate
making out death certificates.

11:19.690 --> 11:22.016
Does Ensign Ro have any family?

11:23.778 --> 11:26.269
- Captain!
- None that I know of.

11:26.698 --> 11:28.987
But I'll check
with the liaison officer.

11:29.117 --> 11:32.950
- I'm not dead.
- I'll have the reports in an hour.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.580
Captain,
I don't know what's going on.

11:56.147 --> 11:57.309
Doctor.

12:00.985 --> 12:02.777
I'm right here.

12:05.407 --> 12:06.782
Damn it...

12:45.533 --> 12:46.862
We're ready.

12:46.993 --> 12:49.401
Riker to Enterprise.
Begin power transfer.

12:56.629 --> 13:01.042
The power flow is consistent
at 400 kolems. No fluctuations.

13:01.175 --> 13:03.501
The main power grid is on line.

13:03.636 --> 13:06.507
- Picard to Riker.
- Riker here.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.641
- Power transfer appears stable.
- Good.

13:09.768 --> 13:12.093
What about the engine replacement?

13:12.229 --> 13:16.393
Engineering is modifying a subspace
resonator to act as a new core.

13:17.193 --> 13:20.644
It won't exceed warp two
but it will get them home.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.523
- Very good.
- Captain.

13:22.657 --> 13:26.904
The diagnostic of the transporter
system shows an energy fluctuation.

13:27.037 --> 13:30.406
I need to check the scanner
in transporter room three.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.332
- By all means.
- Captain?

13:33.877 --> 13:36.119
I have a favour to ask.

13:36.255 --> 13:40.004
I considered Cmdr La Forge
to be my best friend.

13:40.134 --> 13:43.634
I believe I should plan and conduct
the memorial service.

13:43.763 --> 13:47.132
May I have your permission
to do so?

13:47.267 --> 13:49.224
Permission granted.

13:49.352 --> 13:51.345
Make appropriate arrangements.

13:51.855 --> 13:53.266
Thank you, sir.

14:12.461 --> 14:14.039
Commander, the...

14:14.797 --> 14:17.549
The Romulans want a computer.

14:17.675 --> 14:20.380
We cannot give them such access.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.800
That is an unacceptable risk.

14:25.600 --> 14:30.143
What about a core from 40 years ago
that they're already familiar with?

14:31.440 --> 14:33.479
That would be satisfactory.

14:33.609 --> 14:35.981
Check what the Enterprise has.

14:36.111 --> 14:40.359
Be sure your concerns are addressed
before we install it.

14:40.491 --> 14:41.867
Aye, sir.

14:43.995 --> 14:45.323
Thank you.

15:03.224 --> 15:06.059
- La Forge?
- Ro.

15:06.978 --> 15:09.220
Boy, am I glad to see you.

15:09.356 --> 15:11.847
And I'm really glad you can see me.

15:12.985 --> 15:15.392
It's like I'm here
but I'm not here.

15:15.529 --> 15:17.937
No one can see me, either.

15:20.827 --> 15:23.115
I can't figure it out.

15:24.664 --> 15:28.033
One minute we were transporting
from the Romulan vessel.

15:28.168 --> 15:31.335
The next, I wake up in the arboretum
with a headache.

15:33.507 --> 15:36.841
Can you pass through things
like bulkheads?

15:36.969 --> 15:39.756
Tables. People. Yeah.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.236
We're solid enough to each other.

15:59.285 --> 16:03.497
- It's not what you expected.
- What do you mean?

16:04.207 --> 16:05.749
This.

16:05.875 --> 16:06.907
Death.

16:07.627 --> 16:10.581
- What?
- We're dead, Geordi.

16:10.714 --> 16:12.707
Is that some kind of joke?

16:13.258 --> 16:17.007
Our patterns were lost
in a transporter malfunction.

16:17.137 --> 16:20.092
We never re-materialised
after leaving the ship.

16:22.477 --> 16:23.888
Wait a minute.

16:24.938 --> 16:28.307
What are you saying?
We're some sort of spirits?

16:28.441 --> 16:33.436
Spirits, souls.
My people used to call them borhyas.

16:33.572 --> 16:35.529
Whatever term you use, we're it.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.196
But...

16:37.326 --> 16:39.651
My uniform, my visor.

16:40.329 --> 16:43.247
Are you saying
I'm some blind ghost with clothes?

16:43.374 --> 16:46.292
I don't know.
I've never been dead before.

16:46.419 --> 16:48.412
We are not dead!

16:48.964 --> 16:50.506
According to Dr Crusher,

16:50.632 --> 16:54.251
we died in a transporter malfunction
at 1430 hours.

16:55.930 --> 16:58.884
Geordi, I saw her make out
the death certificates.

17:04.188 --> 17:07.807
We need to make peace
with our former lives.

17:08.526 --> 17:10.270
That's what I was taught.

17:10.404 --> 17:14.104
We have to say goodbye
to the people in our lives.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.656
No. You may be ready
for the afterlife. I'm not.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.359
I don't see we have much choice.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.993
When I was growing up,

17:24.127 --> 17:27.127
I never gave much thought
to borhyas.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.877
I figured it was superstition
for children, but...

17:30.008 --> 17:32.926
Fine.
You go make peace with yourself.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.303
I'm going
to figure a way out of this.

17:50.113 --> 17:53.981
I didn't have any warning
that something would go wrong.

17:54.118 --> 17:57.119
Suddenly,
their patterns just weren't there.

17:57.538 --> 18:01.785
I believe the cause may be
the explosion on the Romulan ship.

18:01.918 --> 18:02.914
Really?

18:03.044 --> 18:05.665
But that happened
before we even arrived.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.707
In all likelihood, the explosion
damaged their cloaking device,

18:10.844 --> 18:13.335
causing it to discharge
chroniton particles.

18:13.472 --> 18:15.465
I detect a chroniton field here.

18:15.599 --> 18:17.093
A chroniton field?

18:17.226 --> 18:20.097
If the particles were produced
on the Romulan ship,

18:20.229 --> 18:21.723
why are they here?

18:21.856 --> 18:23.231
The transporter beam.

18:23.358 --> 18:25.813
I suspect the transporter beam
carried them.

18:25.944 --> 18:28.435
That may have caused the deaths.

18:28.572 --> 18:32.356
I will go to the Romulan ship
to discover the source.

18:32.492 --> 18:35.529
Commander,
are these chronitons dangerous?

18:35.663 --> 18:37.572
They pose no danger to humans.

18:37.706 --> 18:41.918
However, some of the
ship's systems may be affected.

18:42.044 --> 18:44.370
When I return,
I will eradicate them.

18:45.798 --> 18:47.507
La Forge to Ensign...

18:55.976 --> 18:57.684
Thanks for the ride.

19:08.782 --> 19:10.656
I'm here to say goodbye.

19:37.229 --> 19:41.227
There were experimental engine
components lying around there.

19:42.235 --> 19:45.935
I'd say they were testing
a new warp-drive design.

19:46.072 --> 19:49.572
That would explain why they're
so far from Romulan space.

19:49.701 --> 19:52.868
To avoid Federation long-range scans.

19:52.996 --> 19:56.247
We should have a core
for them at 1900 hours.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.709
Commander, there will be
a memorial service at 2300 hours.

19:59.837 --> 20:01.664
Mr Data is making arrangements.

20:02.173 --> 20:04.249
- I'll be there.
- Me, too.

20:04.384 --> 20:08.845
- In fact, I'll say a few words.
- You knew La Forge.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.297
Actually,
I was thinking of Ensign Ro.

20:11.892 --> 20:15.391
- Me?
- Coordinate with Mr Data.

20:15.521 --> 20:17.976
Wait. What are you going to say?

20:28.618 --> 20:29.899
Captain...

20:36.835 --> 20:38.793
I don't believe this.

20:39.630 --> 20:44.755
I'm dead, you can't hear me
and I'm still intimidated by you.

20:50.225 --> 20:54.472
I just... wanted to say thank you.

20:57.483 --> 21:00.733
For trusting in me
when no one else would.

21:02.738 --> 21:05.194
Hey. There you are.

21:05.325 --> 21:06.985
Excuse me, Captain. Listen.

21:07.494 --> 21:10.827
Data's going to the Romulan ship.
We need to go.

21:10.956 --> 21:11.952
Why?

21:12.082 --> 21:15.866
I think that what happened to us,
the answers, are there.

21:16.003 --> 21:18.292
Why can't you just accept
the fact...?

21:18.422 --> 21:21.423
If you're right, this doesn't make
any difference.

21:21.551 --> 21:26.462
If I'm right, then we're still alive
and I'm gonna need your help.

21:42.990 --> 21:44.948
Lieutenant.

21:45.076 --> 21:48.410
I am planning a memorial service
for La Forge and Ro.

21:48.538 --> 21:50.697
I would like you to participate.

21:50.832 --> 21:52.375
What kind of service?

21:52.501 --> 21:56.250
Capt Picard asked for a ceremony
that was appropriate.

21:56.380 --> 22:00.248
I have given a great deal of thought
to what is appropriate.

22:01.344 --> 22:04.013
Shuttlecraft four is not yet clear
of the Romulans.

22:04.138 --> 22:05.716
Hold position.

22:05.848 --> 22:08.600
It's weird, listening to them
plan our funeral.

22:08.727 --> 22:13.887
I find it difficult to decide
on a service. Any suggestions?

22:17.528 --> 22:21.027
Human custom is to conduct
a solemn, dignified service,

22:21.157 --> 22:24.324
in which the dead are praised
by their loved ones.

22:24.827 --> 22:26.654
Ensign Ro was Bajoran.

22:26.788 --> 22:28.994
Her beliefs should be reflected
as well.

22:29.124 --> 22:31.496
Their death rituals are complicated.

22:31.626 --> 22:33.418
Please, not the Death Chant.

22:33.545 --> 22:36.333
The Bajoran Death Chant
is two hours long.

22:37.257 --> 22:41.006
I am not certain that human
or Bajoran rites are fitting.

22:41.137 --> 22:45.466
I have researched the customs
of 5,000 cultures to no avail.

22:46.643 --> 22:50.094
- Shuttlecraft four has cleared.
- Resume course.

22:52.357 --> 22:54.017
In almost all societies,

22:54.151 --> 22:57.152
it is traditional
to say a ritual farewell

22:57.279 --> 22:58.987
to those you call friends.

23:00.282 --> 23:02.774
I never had a friend until Geordi.

23:03.327 --> 23:07.705
He spoke to me and treated me
no differently from anyone else.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.073
He accepted me for what I am.

23:12.045 --> 23:15.296
And that, I have learned,
is friendship.

23:18.802 --> 23:20.842
But how do I say goodbye?

23:20.972 --> 23:23.427
He seems almost human, doesn't he?

23:23.558 --> 23:27.141
I'm not the proper person
to advise you.

23:28.104 --> 23:29.100
Why?

23:31.441 --> 23:33.849
I am happy for Cmdr La Forge.

23:34.736 --> 23:39.446
He has crossed over
to that which is beyond.

23:39.575 --> 23:42.362
For a Klingon,
this is a joyful time.

23:45.415 --> 23:48.950
A friend has died
in the line of duty.

23:49.085 --> 23:52.040
He has earned a place
among the honoured dead.

23:53.048 --> 23:55.254
It is not a time to mourn.

24:01.515 --> 24:03.010
Begin docking.

24:06.062 --> 24:09.514
Data, that's a nice sentiment,
but premature.

24:10.483 --> 24:13.687
I don't plan on being commemorated
before my time.

24:29.879 --> 24:33.498
I'm afraid I fail to see the point
of this investigation.

24:33.634 --> 24:38.379
Chroniton emissions may have claimed
the lives of our officers.

24:38.514 --> 24:40.554
A most regrettable event.

24:40.683 --> 24:43.352
Was your cloaking device damaged
in the explosion?

24:44.604 --> 24:47.973
All of our systems were,
including the cloaking device.

24:48.108 --> 24:51.559
That explains the chronitons
I am detecting in here now.

24:51.695 --> 24:55.230
For your safety, it is important
to eliminate those emissions.

24:55.365 --> 24:56.610
Our safety?

24:56.742 --> 25:01.120
There is no way to predict
their interaction with the new core.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.828
I have never seen this.

25:07.962 --> 25:11.248
There is something that looks
like a molecular phase inverter.

25:11.383 --> 25:12.379
What?

25:12.884 --> 25:15.043
It's supposed to change matter

25:15.179 --> 25:18.096
so it can pass
through normal matter and energy.

25:18.599 --> 25:20.177
Hang on a second.

25:20.309 --> 25:21.969
A few years back,

25:22.103 --> 25:26.931
the Klingons tried to combine a phase
inverter and a cloaking device.

25:27.066 --> 25:29.818
In theory,
a phased ship could hide anywhere,

25:29.945 --> 25:31.403
even inside a planet.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.688
Conventional weapons
would be useless.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.484
How far did they get?

25:35.617 --> 25:38.453
It never got out
of the preliminary stages.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.200
The Romulans
might be pursuing that,

25:41.332 --> 25:44.250
trying to combine
an inverter and a cloaking device.

25:44.377 --> 25:48.375
- If this is the prototype...
- That explains the explosion.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.084
And us.

25:50.675 --> 25:54.294
- You mean we're cloaked?
- Not just cloaked, phased.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.926
Our molecular structure altered
so that we don't have any substance.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.140
Then that would mean
we're not dead.

26:02.271 --> 26:06.316
It would also mean there's probably
a way to de-phase us.

26:13.408 --> 26:15.864
The emissions are strong
in this area.

26:15.994 --> 26:20.573
You can be assured the emissions
will be eliminated.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.701
Commander, may I speak with you?

26:24.295 --> 26:27.047
If they come back,
they'll find the generator.

26:27.173 --> 26:30.044
Is their transfer beam
still at full intensity?

26:30.176 --> 26:32.928
It will be
until we switch to internal power.

26:33.055 --> 26:37.218
We will set up
a muon feedback wave inside the beam.

26:37.351 --> 26:40.269
Particles will accumulate
in their dilithium chamber.

26:40.396 --> 26:43.682
When they go to warp speed,
their engines will explode.

26:47.237 --> 26:49.644
- We've got to warn them.
- How?

26:49.781 --> 26:53.067
I don't know.
We have to find a way.

27:30.742 --> 27:34.158
The muon feedback wave
isn't on any of the displays.

27:34.288 --> 27:37.289
The Romulans must be hiding it
in a signal.

27:37.416 --> 27:40.583
Without a level-three diagnostic,
they'd never detect it.

27:40.711 --> 27:44.460
There must be some way to warn them
before they hit warp.

27:44.966 --> 27:46.341
This is puzzling.

27:46.467 --> 27:50.050
Three more chroniton fields
have formed in the last hour.

27:50.180 --> 27:54.047
There's no reason why the interphase
device would create new fields.

27:54.184 --> 27:56.343
We should begin decontamination.

27:56.478 --> 28:00.263
Run a sensor sweep of chroniton
fields on the Enterprise.

28:00.399 --> 28:01.680
Aye, sir.

28:04.946 --> 28:10.367
These areas show contamination:
sickbay, transporter room three,

28:10.869 --> 28:13.704
main bridge, Captain's ready room,

28:13.830 --> 28:16.748
shuttlebay two and engineering.

28:16.875 --> 28:18.156
Ro, look!

28:18.294 --> 28:20.832
I do not understand
how these have formed.

28:20.963 --> 28:23.798
No transporter beam has been active
in those areas.

28:23.925 --> 28:25.668
They have nothing in common.

28:25.802 --> 28:29.586
- Yes, they do.
- They are appearing at random.

28:29.723 --> 28:32.759
No, we were
in every one of those locations.

28:32.893 --> 28:34.601
We're leaving footprints.

28:34.728 --> 28:37.433
Can you narrow the scan
to pinpoint locations?

28:37.564 --> 28:39.438
Not with the internal sensors.

28:40.025 --> 28:42.433
Go to science station two.

28:42.570 --> 28:45.524
Use a lateral array
to get a precise reading.

28:45.656 --> 28:49.357
I will modify an anyon emitter
to eliminate the fields.

28:50.203 --> 28:53.952
Why don't you go with her?
I'll stay here with Data.

29:10.934 --> 29:14.552
Interesting. You're reading
chroniton fields, but not from me?

29:19.026 --> 29:21.102
There's a field in this wall? Why?

29:22.446 --> 29:25.151
Data. I came through this wall.

29:25.283 --> 29:27.952
I walked through it when I came in.

29:28.077 --> 29:31.577
When the phased matter in my body
passed through the wall,

29:31.706 --> 29:35.325
it disrupted the wall's structure,
producing a chroniton field.

29:44.679 --> 29:46.588
Data, I'm right here.

29:46.723 --> 29:49.214
That's me you're reading. Watch.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.768
Come on. It's me.

29:57.776 --> 29:59.271
You see?

30:06.452 --> 30:07.947
Do not move.

30:09.289 --> 30:12.160
Yes. I can see you.

30:13.960 --> 30:18.706
- Who are you?
- Where is the scientific officer?

30:18.841 --> 30:23.384
The one like us. The one
who came with you to our ship.

30:23.512 --> 30:26.549
He spoke of a plan
to return to normal.

30:28.142 --> 30:31.013
Yes, this disruptor works.

30:32.272 --> 30:36.566
I was wearing it when I was changed.
Where is he?

30:48.414 --> 30:50.656
Data, stop being so rational.

30:50.792 --> 30:54.078
Try using your imagination
once in a while.

30:54.588 --> 30:58.171
These aren't just
random patterns. It's me.

31:00.135 --> 31:01.844
Watch where you point that.

31:04.307 --> 31:06.596
Wait, I think you did something.

31:09.145 --> 31:11.683
It's not so easy to push through.

31:13.191 --> 31:17.320
The molecules must have been
partly de-phased by the anyon beam.

31:17.446 --> 31:22.025
Data, if a low-level beam
can bring my hand partly back,

31:22.159 --> 31:25.279
maybe a high-level beam
can bring me back.

31:25.413 --> 31:28.165
I'll just have to get you
to turn up the intensity.

31:28.291 --> 31:31.245
Wait a minute, don't stop now.

31:32.170 --> 31:34.792
No, don't give up on it.

31:34.923 --> 31:37.497
It works.
I was just creating more fields.

31:37.634 --> 31:41.882
Your method is fine.
Just turn up the intensity, Data.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.406
He's in here.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.169
- Brossmer to Cmdr Data.
- Data here.

32:15.300 --> 32:19.001
I've just detected
a large chroniton field on deck 17.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.471
The field strength is 300 per cent
above the others.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.557
- Is that Ro?
- Acknowledged.

33:25.042 --> 33:25.956
Get up!

33:28.755 --> 33:30.878
Where is the science officer?

33:32.968 --> 33:34.248
I'll go.

33:37.514 --> 33:39.222
- Commander?
- Ro!

33:39.850 --> 33:43.765
I'm detecting a chroniton field.
May I scan the area?

33:43.896 --> 33:45.521
Certainly.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.027
- Thanks.
- Any time.

34:09.257 --> 34:14.132
There's no indication of the
muon wave in our dilithium chamber.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.504
It's there. When they go to warp...

34:16.639 --> 34:18.965
Incoming message
from the Romulan ship.

34:19.101 --> 34:22.138
- On screen.
- Now what?

34:22.980 --> 34:25.898
Installation of
the new engine core is complete.

34:26.025 --> 34:28.777
We are ready to switch
to internal power.

34:28.902 --> 34:31.857
Understood.
Disconnect the power-transfer beam.

34:33.033 --> 34:35.239
We are now on internal power.

34:36.411 --> 34:37.870
Capt Picard,

34:37.996 --> 34:41.614
please accept my sincere thanks
on behalf of the Romulan Empire.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.790
Don't listen to him, Captain.

34:43.918 --> 34:45.911
Our pleasure, Mirok.

34:46.047 --> 34:50.424
I hope this example of cooperation
between our two peoples...

34:51.177 --> 34:53.799
...will not be an isolated incident.

34:53.929 --> 34:55.888
As do l, Captain.

34:58.352 --> 35:00.558
Set a course for Garadius.
Warp six.

35:00.688 --> 35:02.396
- Don't, sir!
- Captain.

35:02.523 --> 35:05.560
I'm still running the
decontamination program.

35:05.693 --> 35:07.982
Mr Data believes we shouldn't
engage warp

35:08.112 --> 35:11.114
until I've cleared
all chroniton fields from the ship.

35:11.241 --> 35:14.076
- Let me know when you finish.
- Sir.

35:14.202 --> 35:16.872
If we get to the locations
she's decontaminating,

35:16.997 --> 35:20.698
maybe the anyon emissions would
re-phase us enough.

35:20.834 --> 35:25.413
The beam would have to be
pretty strong for us to be visible.

35:25.548 --> 35:27.873
Somebody has to look directly at us.

35:28.009 --> 35:31.343
Then let's go somewhere
with a lot of people.

35:34.975 --> 35:38.178
It's time, sir. We should go.

35:40.481 --> 35:42.438
You have the bridge, Mr McDowell.

35:42.566 --> 35:45.900
I'll be at the service
in ten-forward.

35:46.028 --> 35:49.398
Well, that's perfect.
We'll create chroniton fields

35:49.532 --> 35:53.115
and get them to flood that room
with a stronger beam.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.959
Deck ten.

36:03.005 --> 36:06.339
I've been thinking
about the first time I met Geordi.

36:06.467 --> 36:10.252
He was a young officer piloting me
on an inspection tour.

36:10.889 --> 36:13.296
And I made some offhand remark

36:13.433 --> 36:19.104
about the shuttle's engine
efficiency not being what it should.

36:19.231 --> 36:23.478
The next morning, I found
that he'd stayed up all night,

36:23.611 --> 36:25.520
re-fitting the fusion initiators.

36:29.033 --> 36:33.281
I knew then I wanted him
on my next command.

36:36.249 --> 36:38.871
Have you decided
what to say about Ensign Ro?

36:39.002 --> 36:42.253
Yes, I have. It wasn't easy.

36:43.257 --> 36:47.255
- Situations like these...
- What wasn't easy?

36:51.641 --> 36:53.349
What?

37:20.547 --> 37:24.380
- What is going on here?
- It's our memorial service.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.717
- This?
- Why not?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.222
I don't believe this.

37:29.349 --> 37:31.840
They think we're dead
and have a party.

37:31.976 --> 37:33.934
Yeah. It's perfect.

37:34.938 --> 37:36.931
Come on, let's get started.

37:46.659 --> 37:48.866
This is... unusual.

37:48.995 --> 37:51.284
Yeah. I think I like it.

38:04.512 --> 38:07.679
Now I'll never know
what you were gonna say about me.

38:13.355 --> 38:16.938
Do you think the others will find
this service appropriate?

38:18.110 --> 38:19.818
Look around you.

38:19.945 --> 38:23.895
Everybody is sharing their memories
of Geordi and Ro, laughing.

38:24.033 --> 38:26.156
What could be more appropriate?

38:26.285 --> 38:29.405
- I am glad you approve.
- Brossmer to Data.

38:29.539 --> 38:31.947
- Go ahead, Chief.
- Sorry to disturb you.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.242
We've cleared the critical areas

38:34.377 --> 38:38.672
but we've detected a new,
strong field forming in ten-forward.

38:39.383 --> 38:42.799
Should I wait until the service
is over?

38:42.928 --> 38:45.799
No, anyon emissions are harmless.
Begin now.

38:45.932 --> 38:49.182
- Aye, sir.
- Here we go.

38:56.902 --> 39:00.567
Worf, can you see us?
We're right here.

39:00.698 --> 39:01.693
Damn.

39:01.824 --> 39:05.158
We have to find a way to increase
the emission strength.

39:05.286 --> 39:09.201
If she hadn't lost her rank
in that incident at Garon IV,

39:09.332 --> 39:11.408
she'd be Lieutenant Commander
by now.

39:11.543 --> 39:13.832
- Bridge to Picard.
- Go ahead.

39:13.962 --> 39:15.789
Incoming message
from Garadius IV.

39:15.922 --> 39:19.339
The situation is deteriorating.
They want our ETA.

39:19.468 --> 39:21.425
Stand by, Ensign. Excuse me.

39:22.179 --> 39:25.513
We have to do something
before they go into warp.

39:25.641 --> 39:27.930
The disruptor,
I'll put it on overload.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.436
Do it.

39:44.203 --> 39:45.401
Let's go.

39:49.208 --> 39:51.534
I would like to go soon.

39:54.631 --> 39:58.083
I see no reason to delay.
The chroniton fields have cleared.

39:59.678 --> 40:03.807
Excellent. Mr McDowell,
set a course for Garadius.

40:03.933 --> 40:09.390
Cmdr Data, field strength has
increased by 3,000 percent.

40:09.522 --> 40:10.803
Curious.

40:10.940 --> 40:14.689
Captain, we should decontaminate
this room before getting under way.

40:14.819 --> 40:16.859
- Very well.
- Chief.

40:17.531 --> 40:21.114
Increase anyon emissions
to 6,000 particles per second.

40:21.243 --> 40:25.158
- Decontaminate this area.
- OK, hang on.

40:29.585 --> 40:32.255
Data, do you see us?
We're here.

40:32.380 --> 40:33.875
Right here.

40:35.342 --> 40:38.925
- Did you see that, Mr Data?
- Yes, sir.

40:39.972 --> 40:42.214
Come on, Data,
put it all together.

40:43.017 --> 40:46.267
These were not ghosts.
What did we see?

40:46.938 --> 40:48.765
I believe I may know, sir.

40:48.898 --> 40:50.642
Data, please be right.

40:50.775 --> 40:54.690
It would explain
the mysterious chroniton fields.

40:55.697 --> 40:58.402
If they were cloaked in some way.

40:58.534 --> 41:00.859
You're saying
that they're still alive?

41:00.995 --> 41:04.198
If I'm right, they are,
and in this room.

41:04.331 --> 41:07.997
Their brief appearance coincided
with the anyon sweep.

41:08.127 --> 41:11.995
Perhaps the anyons neutralised
the cloaking effect.

41:12.716 --> 41:14.874
- Chief Brossmer.
- Yes, Commander?

41:15.010 --> 41:18.461
Set the beam to its highest level.
Flood ten-forward.

41:18.597 --> 41:19.842
Aye, sir.

41:34.823 --> 41:38.073
- Data, do you see us?
- Of course.

41:43.791 --> 41:47.836
La Forge to Engineering.
Take the warp engines off line.

41:47.962 --> 41:50.916
There's a muon wave
inside the dilithium chamber.

41:51.049 --> 41:52.958
Captain, who gave that order?

41:53.093 --> 41:56.841
That was Cmdr La Forge.
Please follow his instructions.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.347
Aye, sir.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.133
It looks like a great party.
Can we join you?

42:19.580 --> 42:22.367
Geordi, it is good to see you.

42:22.499 --> 42:26.747
Thanks, Data.
I've never been to a better funeral.

42:44.190 --> 42:45.601
Could you pass the rolls?

42:49.070 --> 42:51.110
You've been eating for an hour.

42:51.239 --> 42:52.781
Come on.

42:52.907 --> 42:56.027
We didn't eat for almost two days.
I'm hungry.

43:01.834 --> 43:04.040
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

43:04.795 --> 43:06.587
Come on.

43:12.178 --> 43:15.132
I was raised with Bajoran beliefs.

43:16.767 --> 43:19.092
I even followed
some of the practices.

43:21.605 --> 43:25.188
But I never really believed
in a life after death.

43:27.069 --> 43:32.230
Then suddenly I was dead
and there was this other life.

43:34.286 --> 43:39.078
And it made me feel arrogant to
discount everything I'd been taught.

43:44.797 --> 43:47.502
Now I don't know what to believe.

43:49.218 --> 43:50.594
Well...

43:50.720 --> 43:53.258
We should develop
our own interphase device.

43:55.350 --> 43:59.811
If it can teach Ro Laren humility,
it can do anything.
