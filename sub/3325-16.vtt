WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.287
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.503 --> 00:03.583
That was supposed to be locked.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.290
- What are those?
- Atomic numbers.

00:05.465 --> 00:06.625
Kira.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.835
I'm gonna take your picture.

00:09.051 --> 00:11.633
Proof of our time here together.

00:19.270 --> 00:20.851
- Isaac!
- Isaac, open up!

00:27.487 --> 00:28.602
Yeah!

01:03.940 --> 01:04.895
Baac?

01:06.192 --> 01:07.181
Isaac!

01:10.863 --> 01:12.364
He's freezing. Dad, he's like ice.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.109
Isaac, look at me. Isaac.

01:14.325 --> 01:15.815
- What's happening to him?
- Isaac, come on.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.151
Isaac, listen. You have to turn.

01:19.372 --> 01:20.452
Look at me.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.205
You need to trigger it. Come on. Turn!

01:23.668 --> 01:25.374
Turn! Turn!

01:32.677 --> 01:34.963
- Did you see them?
- Who?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.299
There were five of them.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.718
They wore black.

01:41.519 --> 01:44.682
I couldn't... I couldn't see their faces.
They were covered.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.805
- What do you mean? Like masks?
- One of them, I could see his eyes.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.562
They were greenish-yellow. Like a...

01:52.738 --> 01:54.148
Like a firefly.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.279
Security system wasn't triggered.

01:59.495 --> 02:00.530
How did they get in?

02:00.746 --> 02:03.738
They didn't.
It was like they came out of the shadows.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.035
Do you know what that means?

02:09.422 --> 02:10.411
Dad?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.465
Um... I'm not sure.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.012
Listen, the two of you.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.553
I need you to
keep this quiet for a few hours.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.339
From everyone?

02:22.143 --> 02:23.633
Just 24 hours.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.309
They could've killed him, Dad.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.977
But they didn't.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.396
And I think there was a reason why.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.397
I think they might have been after me.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.435
So when did you get there?

03:50.022 --> 03:51.262
At the same time.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.565
- At the same time as who?
- At the same time as me.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.018
- By coincidence?
- What do you mean coincidence?

03:57.238 --> 03:58.273
That's what I'm asking you.

03:58.489 --> 04:01.071
The two of you arrived at the same time.
Was that coincidence?

04:01.951 --> 04:03.691
- Are you asking me?
- I think he's asking me.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.574
- I think he's asking the both of you.
- Okay, let me answer the questions.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.166
Let me ask the questions.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.255
Just so I have this absolutely clear.

04:15.715 --> 04:18.923
Barrow was hiding
in the chemistry closet at the school.

04:19.135 --> 04:21.126
Someone left him
a coded message on the blackboard

04:21.345 --> 04:22.755
telling him to kill Kira.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.930
Then Barrow took Kira
to a power substation

04:26.517 --> 04:29.008
and tied her up
with the intent of electrocuting her,

04:29.478 --> 04:31.764
which blacked out the entire town.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.687
Sounds about right.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.890
How did you know
he'd take her to a power station?

04:36.277 --> 04:40.065
Well, 'cause he was an electrical engineer.
So where else would he take her?

04:41.031 --> 04:42.942
That's one hell of a deduction there, Stiles.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.697
Yeah, what can I say? I take after my pops.
He's in law enforcement.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.116
Stiles, just, uh... Just answer the man.

04:54.754 --> 04:56.540
We made a good guess.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.462
What were the two of you doing?

04:59.008 --> 05:00.839
- Eating pizza.
- Eating sushi.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.671
- Eating sushi.
- Eating pizza.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.964
Eating sushi and pizza.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.383
- You believe this?
- To be honest,

05:10.603 --> 05:13.515
I haven't believed a word Stiles has said
since he learned how to speak.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.271
But I think these kids found themselves

05:16.484 --> 05:18.395
in the right place at the right time

05:18.611 --> 05:20.977
and that girl sitting there
is very lucky for it.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.860
Kira, is that how you remember it?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.071
Yes.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.538
Could I get my phone back now?

05:38.422 --> 05:39.878
Sorry, but no.

05:44.637 --> 05:46.548
Kira, a deputy is going to take you home.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.005
But we'll need you
to fill out some paperwork first.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.315
Scott.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.613
I don't know why you guys are lying.

06:05.825 --> 06:08.032
Or why Stilinski
is content to listen to this crap.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.078
But try and remember something.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.243
If half this story about Barrow is true,

06:12.456 --> 06:13.992
then not only did
someone help set him loose,

06:14.208 --> 06:16.574
but he was a pawn in their little game.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.628
A mass murderer is bad enough.

06:18.838 --> 06:21.375
A mass murderer being
controlled by someone?

06:22.091 --> 06:23.080
Far worse.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.464
Yeah, I get it.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.297
All right, go home. It's a school night.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.296
Class starts in five minutes.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.380
Just because there's no power

07:13.601 --> 07:16.263
don't expect there to be no school.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.558
That was a triple negative.
Very impressive, Coach.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.480
Copy that.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.688
Oops!

07:30.492 --> 07:32.198
Hello. Where did you come from?

07:43.297 --> 07:46.004
- No. No. Stop. Stop.
- What? I need to talk to her.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.128
No, you need to remember that someone left
a coded message telling Barrow to kill her.

07:49.345 --> 07:50.926
Which is why I need to talk to her.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.344
Scott, no way.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.514
Until we figure out
if she's just another psychotic monster

07:55.726 --> 07:57.682
that's going to start murdering everybody,

07:57.895 --> 08:00.307
I vote against any and all interaction.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.268
What if she's like me?

08:04.485 --> 08:07.602
That girl walked through
1.21 gigawatts of electricity.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.231
She's not like you.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.455
Don't you have
portable generators or something?

08:24.213 --> 08:27.000
It's a black light party.
It's not like you need a ton of power...

08:27.841 --> 08:30.423
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

08:33.973 --> 08:36.680
- Black light party?
- More like canceled party.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.634
The venue I booked won't have power
for at least another day.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.060
- You need help finding a new place?
- What's the point?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.773
Nothing in town's going to have power.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.559
Thanks anyway.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.652
You want to throw a Halloween party?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.439
What's next?
Are you gonna join the Yearbook Club?

08:53.909 --> 08:56.742
- Just trying to do something nice.
- Why? Who cares?

08:58.580 --> 08:59.911
He does.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.622
You don't get it, do you?

09:02.835 --> 09:05.542
Scott doesn't care about power.
He cares about people.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.289
You want to be a wolf in his pack?

09:07.506 --> 09:09.667
Try being a human in high school.

09:18.934 --> 09:22.051
Sweetheart, since this is my first class
and I haven't taught in five years,

09:22.271 --> 09:24.637
I just want to remind you of one thing.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.644
Try not to embarrass me.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.772
You should've thought about that
before wearing those shoes.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.398
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.741
Why's your mom teaching biology?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.403
Because Mr. Harris used to teach biology.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.701
Until his new occupation...

09:44.501 --> 09:46.037
Human sacrifice.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.668
What? I didn't kill him.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.206
Lydia, what?

09:57.598 --> 09:59.714
I helped save someone's life.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.265
That felt really good.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.514
And I look at you,

10:05.564 --> 10:08.180
and all I can think is
that you helped kill Boyd.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.938
You're notjust a bad boy, Aiden.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.778
You're a bad guy.

10:16.909 --> 10:19.491
And I don't want to be with the bad guys.

10:27.086 --> 10:29.702
I thinkl know a place
where you can have your party.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.566
I don't want to talk about it.

10:55.948 --> 10:56.983
Okay.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.400
Want to talk about
the pre-cal test on Friday?

11:01.578 --> 11:04.365
The teacher takes
all the equations right out of the book.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.747
Do you have your phone?

11:15.884 --> 11:18.717
I'm going to show you
something no one else has ever seen.

11:19.138 --> 11:20.469
No one except for Barrow.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.096
Take a picture of me. And use the flash.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.942
Whoa.

11:40.159 --> 11:41.114
Yeah.

11:41.285 --> 11:42.570
- What is it?
- I don't know.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.905
It started showing up
a couple of months ago.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.532
It only happens with the flash on.

11:46.748 --> 11:50.036
And I don't know how,
but Barrow knew about it.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.959
He used my own phone
to take pictures of me.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.917
That's why you asked for it back.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.919
If someone sees those pictures...

12:00.637 --> 12:02.593
We need to get your phone back.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.270
Trick or treat!

12:57.736 --> 13:00.227
Where did you say
the guy was who lives here?

13:01.240 --> 13:02.525
He's out of town.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.868
Oh, yeah.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.632
Okay, this one will get you into
all of the perimeter doors,

13:29.851 --> 13:31.227
this one into the evidence room,

13:31.436 --> 13:33.301
and this one's for my father's office.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.643
You didn't steal these, did you?

13:34.815 --> 13:38.307
No. I cloned them using the RFID emulator.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.559
Is that worse than stealing?

13:41.655 --> 13:42.815
It's smarter.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.071
Scott, can I ask you something?

13:46.535 --> 13:48.071
Okay, I'll just...

13:49.538 --> 13:51.699
You didn't tell him anything, did you?

13:51.915 --> 13:53.200
About the pictures?

13:54.251 --> 13:58.085
Oh, no, Ijust said that you have some
pictures of you on your phone

13:58.297 --> 14:00.504
that you didn't want anyone to see.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.456
What kind of pictures?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.921
Naked pictures.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.965
Oh. Good idea.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.341
Okay, cool.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.641
Okay.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.434
Okay. So, now almost everybody's
out dealing with the blackout, okay.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.389
But there's always
somebody at the front desk.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.349
Dispatch, usually a night shifter or two.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.065
You guys are gonna use
the service door entrance by the dumpster.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.613
All right? Nobody uses it.
Now, I'll text you if anyone comes out.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.531
But, Scott,
if you get caught, I can't help you.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.738
My dad's under investigation
for an impeachment

14:30.954 --> 14:33.070
because of your dad,
so, if anything happens

14:33.290 --> 14:34.871
I will run and leave you both for dead.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.496
Got it. Thanks. Seriously, dude.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.920
- I'd ask my dad, you know, but...
- No, I know. I get it.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.585
All right, just, uh, hurry up.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.613
Kira.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.622
It's dead.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.339
- We have to take it.
- No, they'll know it's gone.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.876
How do we charge it if the power's out?

16:16.935 --> 16:18.971
See if you can find a charger cable.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.275
Awesome.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.734
Who's that?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.612
Me.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.789
Me and my dad.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.549
Come on, come on.

17:10.906 --> 17:11.986
Ah, hell.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.276
Come on. Come on...

17:23.585 --> 17:24.870
Come on, Scott.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.079
Okay, I'm so going to regret this.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.436
Hey, hey. Wow! Thank God you are here.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.105
Oh, boy! Thank the lord.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.987
- What do you want, Stiles?
- Oh, jeez!

17:54.533 --> 17:58.276
I was just...
I was thinking on the case.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.242
I was thinking
I should clue you in on my thinking.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.492
And here's my thinking.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.656
I was thinking this...

18:04.876 --> 18:08.334
I was thinking that Barrow, right...

18:08.547 --> 18:10.333
Barrow received the information

18:10.549 --> 18:12.414
about who to kill at the school,
right, you know that?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.590
So I was thinking
that maybe the person who

18:14.803 --> 18:16.339
gave him that information,

18:16.555 --> 18:17.886
check this out,

18:18.348 --> 18:20.509
might actually be someone

18:21.685 --> 18:23.095
at the school.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.813
And that's, uh, my thinking.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.014
Hmm.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.271
It's on. It's on.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.857
You're right.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.984
- I am?
- Yep. We, uh...

18:37.200 --> 18:40.784
We started looking for links between Barrow,
faculty and students last night.

18:41.955 --> 18:42.910
Okay.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.331
So you already, then, know that stuff?
You already thought of that.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.499
- Your dad did.
- Oh.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.959
His one useful suggestion.

18:55.343 --> 18:59.177
You know, this attitude
that you have toward my dad?

19:00.098 --> 19:03.090
You can dress it up to all
the professional disapproval that you want.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.346
But I know the real reason
why you don't like him.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.015
Is that so?

19:08.231 --> 19:11.223
Yeah. Because he knows something that
you don't want him to know.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.276
And guess what.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.862
I know it, too.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.490
Go home, Stiles.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.622
There's a... There's a curfew.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.016
- We did it. All the pics deleted.
- That was awesome!

19:56.071 --> 19:59.609
I mean, terrifying. Completely terrifying.
But kind of awesome.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.493
I've never done anything like that before.
Have you?

20:05.538 --> 20:06.994
Yeah, once or twice.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.083
So, I guess I should take you home.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.770
Hey, you don't want to go to a party,
would you?

20:53.336 --> 20:55.292
Derek can never know about this.

21:05.515 --> 21:06.504
Happy?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.972
- Very.
- Good.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.968
Now it's my time to be happy.
This one needs to get painted up.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.473
- Face or body?
- Uh...

21:17.026 --> 21:18.015
Body.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.526
I need ice!

21:20.947 --> 21:22.027
I got it.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.409
All done.

22:15.794 --> 22:16.829
Nice.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.891
ltjust showed up there
on my key ring this morning.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.818
I asked my dad if he put it there but
he said he didn't know anything about it.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.355
- It's just a key, right?
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.657
And I don't know
how it got there or what it's for.

23:30.869 --> 23:33.485
- You want to leave so we can figure it out?
- Uh...

23:36.374 --> 23:37.739
Happy Halloween!

23:43.882 --> 23:45.042
It can wait.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.293
It can wait.

23:56.519 --> 23:57.508
Thanks.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.641
- What?
- Thanks!

24:02.275 --> 24:03.640
For what?

24:03.860 --> 24:05.396
For everything.

25:22.855 --> 25:23.981
Excuse me. Sorry.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.730
- Hey!
- Hey! I kissed you.

25:26.943 --> 25:29.855
Yeah, you kind of did.
What's your name?

25:30.071 --> 25:32.357
- I'm Caitlin.
- Caitlin...

25:33.324 --> 25:36.282
- Oh, my God. You're Caitlin.
- I know! Ijust told you that.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.701
No, I know. Ijust... I mean...

25:38.913 --> 25:41.120
You and your girlfriend. She's...

25:41.666 --> 25:44.749
- She died.
- Yeah! Are you okay?

25:45.211 --> 25:48.044
- Yeah! I'm really drunk.
- Okay.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.212
Do you want to dance?

25:51.426 --> 25:52.415
Yeah!

26:05.690 --> 26:07.305
Not as good as the real ones.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.349
Or as lethal.

26:09.944 --> 26:12.902
Okay, sure. I deserve that.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.480
I deserve basically
everything you say about me.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.487
But, you know,
I was pretty instrumental setting this up.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.363
All this?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.945
If I wanted to go to a rave,

26:23.624 --> 26:26.491
I'd get in a time machine
and go back to the '90s.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.085
Did you see Scott?

26:38.056 --> 26:39.045
Yep.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.342
You tell him what happened?

26:40.558 --> 26:42.514
No. We still have
a couple hours, remember?

26:42.727 --> 26:44.934
- We promised my dad.
- You promised your dad.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.810
I promised him in order to protect him.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.142
You did.
I didn't.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.308
ls protecting my father such a bad thing?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.859
I don't like keeping secrets from Scott.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.613
No, you don't,

26:58.826 --> 27:02.489
you just like to stand there awkwardly
waiting for someone to notice us...

27:03.039 --> 27:04.199
Whatever we are.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.990
And then you like to make things...

27:09.003 --> 27:10.243
incredibly uncomfortable.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.670
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- What do you think it means?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.339
I think it means you're probably mad.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.052
- I'm not mad.
- No?

27:17.261 --> 27:18.341
- No.
- Okay.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.049
I'm frustrated.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.511
Sexually?

27:49.585 --> 27:51.997
Do you want to talk about Scott
or do you want to paint my body?

27:53.798 --> 27:55.459
I want to paint your body.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.392
Oh! Finally.

28:17.405 --> 28:18.645
Awkwardly.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.111
Predictably.

28:52.523 --> 28:53.478
Scott.

28:55.568 --> 28:56.683
Scott!

30:24.824 --> 30:26.815
- Ethan?
- Aiden.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.116
- Where's Ethan?
- I'm looking for him too.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.034
I haven't seen him in like half an hour.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.368
Is something wrong?

30:35.793 --> 30:36.999
Aiden?

30:38.212 --> 30:39.327
Aiden?

30:41.841 --> 30:43.377
Do you have a bottle opener?

30:43.592 --> 30:44.672
Yes.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.837
Your key has phosphors on it.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.171
Look.

30:52.935 --> 30:53.970
Yeah.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.513
Oh! Oh!

31:06.824 --> 31:09.236
Uh, I thought you liked girls.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.026
I do like girls. Do you?

31:12.705 --> 31:14.366
- Absolutely.
- Great.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.701
- So you also like boys?
- Absolutely.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.375
Do you?

31:27.678 --> 31:28.838
Mmm.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.424
I am sorry. What are phosphors?

31:31.640 --> 31:34.598
Oh, they're any substance that Iuminesces.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.516
It's in your teeth and your fingernails.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.344
Laundry detergent.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.807
It's also in this.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.640
Reacts to the UV light, that's why it glows.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.201
How would I get phosphors on my key?

31:55.623 --> 31:57.363
Have you been handling chemicals?

31:57.541 --> 31:58.951
No, I don't think I...

32:05.383 --> 32:08.500
I'm sorry. I'm really, totally sorry.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.880
I just thought of something
and I have to go.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.587
Really, I don't want to. I want to stay.

32:12.765 --> 32:16.178
I would just stay all night, I swear.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.931
But I really have to go
and I don't want to offend you.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.853
- Okay.
- Sorry. Ijust... Okay? Okay.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.683
Sorry. Here. You drink that.

32:25.903 --> 32:28.110
Drink that whole thing. Whole thing, okay?

32:28.322 --> 32:29.732
Excuse me. Bye!

32:42.503 --> 32:43.868
You got some paint on you.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.705
- Still there.
- Oh...

32:50.845 --> 32:52.255
Ah, let me.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.888
Oh, my God!

33:01.522 --> 33:03.433
I can't believe you just mommed me.

33:03.858 --> 33:06.349
- I did not mom you.
- You totally mommed me.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.478
Okay, I might have slightly mommed you.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.162
How are you so okay with all of this?

33:20.833 --> 33:23.950
Ijust showed you a picture that would
send anyone else running the other way.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.706
It didn't look that bad to me.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.125
I look like a demon from hell.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.503
I guess I saw something different.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.251
What did you see?

33:34.263 --> 33:37.221
It kind of looks like it's, uh, protecting you.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.014
Kind of like armor.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.516
And it doesn't look like a demon to me.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.969
What do you think it looks like?

33:46.442 --> 33:47.932
It looks like a fox.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.843
What? What's wrong?

34:20.476 --> 34:22.432
There's something on your head.

34:22.645 --> 34:24.181
Behind your ear.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.643
Turn to the mirror. Turn to the mirror.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.778
You see that?

34:36.909 --> 34:37.944
What is that?

34:39.119 --> 34:41.030
Looks like the number five.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.118
Did you hear that?

35:00.558 --> 35:02.219
Aiden, over here!

35:03.060 --> 35:04.800
Lydia? Lydia?

35:05.604 --> 35:07.265
Lydia? What happened?

35:07.856 --> 35:10.142
- What happened to her?
- I don't know, but she's freezing.

35:10.359 --> 35:13.021
- She's practically hypothermic.
- We gotta get her inside. Help.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.487
Over here. There's a heating vent.

35:22.246 --> 35:23.827
I'll try to find a blanket.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.748
- What are you doing?
- It'll trigger the healing.

35:36.594 --> 35:38.425
They came out of the dark.

35:41.890 --> 35:42.925
It's the same.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.726
It's exactly the same.

36:07.541 --> 36:08.701
Derek?

36:19.553 --> 36:23.011
Bro, sorry, but The Bloody Beetroots
doesn't take requests.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.349
Bro, seriously. I said the DJ doesn't take...

36:28.771 --> 36:30.102
He'll take mine.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.366
Get out!

36:43.369 --> 36:44.825
Damn, dude!

36:54.546 --> 36:57.003
- Get her out of here.
- Go find Scott.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.394
Guys, they're all looking at me.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.693
Why are they all looking at me?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.029
Guys?

38:36.690 --> 38:38.351
Somebody do something!

39:28.742 --> 39:30.482
What the hell were those things?

39:34.456 --> 39:36.572
Your dad's 24 hours are up.

40:30.554 --> 40:33.591
Barrow was hiding
in the chemistry closet at the school.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.466
Someone left him
a coded message on the blackboard

40:37.686 --> 40:39.392
telling him to kill Kira.
