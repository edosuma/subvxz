00:32.878 --> 00:36.109
<i>[Mrs. Beale]</i>
<i>What are you doing down there?</i>
<i>Just standing there?</i>

00:36.182 --> 00:39.310
- <i>[David Maysles]</i>
<i>Just filming the main room.</i>
- <i>[Edie] Whiskers!</i>

00:39.385 --> 00:42.149
<i>[Mrs. Beale]</i>
<i>Well, did you know that</i>
<i>Whiskers has disappeared?</i>

00:42.221 --> 00:44.917
- <i>A cat got out.</i>
<i>I'm trying to get him in.</i>
- <i>[David] Has he? Ah.</i>

00:44.990 --> 00:48.892
Yeah, we don't know how he got out.
I think he got out in that hole there.

00:48.961 --> 00:52.158
- <i>No, I knew they were coming, and</i> I...
- <i>I think he got out in that hole.</i>

00:52.231 --> 00:55.166
- <i>He can jump up there.</i>
- <i>I knew they were coming and...</i>

00:55.234 --> 00:57.498
Yeah. No, he got out
in that hole, Edie.

00:57.570 --> 01:00.505
<i>I put them all out.</i>
<i>You told me to.</i>

01:00.573 --> 01:03.974
No, dearie, he got out
in the hole, babe.

01:04.043 --> 01:06.341
<i>"Take the cats out,"you said.</i>

01:06.412 --> 01:09.347
- Did you hear what I said, woman?
- <i>What?</i>

01:09.415 --> 01:13.010
He got out in this hole here.
That was the noise we heard.

01:13.085 --> 01:16.987
<i>That raccoon did that to my new wall.</i>
<i>Isn't that terrible?</i>

01:17.056 --> 01:19.650
<i>They'll have the whole house</i>
<i>down soon.</i>

01:19.725 --> 01:22.922
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>Yeah, we'll be raided again.</i>

01:22.995 --> 01:26.692
<i>We'll be raided again</i>
<i>by the village of East Hampton.</i>

01:26.765 --> 01:32.533
<i>You know, they can get you</i>
<i>in East Hampton for wearing</i>
<i>red shoes on a Thursday...</i>

01:32.605 --> 01:34.470
<i>and all that sort of thing.</i>

01:34.540 --> 01:37.475
<i>I don't know whether you know that.</i>
<i>I mean, do you know that?</i>

01:37.543 --> 01:39.977
<i>They can get you</i>
<i>for almost anything.</i>

02:56.221 --> 02:58.689
- <i>[Edie] It's the Maysles!</i>
- <i>[Albert Maysles] Hi, Edie.</i>

02:58.757 --> 03:01.225
- <i>[David] The gentlemen callers.</i>
- <i>I saw your car.</i>

03:01.293 --> 03:04.387
- <i>One of my cats just got out.</i>
- <i>Edie, you look fantastic.</i>

03:04.463 --> 03:07.626
David, you look absolutely
terrific. Honestly.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.669
You've got light...
You've got light blue on.

03:10.736 --> 03:14.934
Well, Al, you're still...
Mother says you're very conservative.

03:15.007 --> 03:18.966
[Laughs]
Brooks, everything looks wonderful.

03:19.044 --> 03:22.844
- Thank you.
- <i>Absolutely wonderful.</i>

03:22.915 --> 03:26.112
This is the best thing
to wear for the day. You understand.

03:26.185 --> 03:28.813
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Because I don't like women in skirts,

03:28.887 --> 03:32.254
and the best thing is to wear
pantyhose or some pants...

03:32.324 --> 03:35.122
under a short skirt, I think.

03:35.194 --> 03:38.163
Then you have the pants
under the skirt,

03:38.230 --> 03:42.599
and then you can pull the stockings
up over the pants, underneath the skirt.

03:42.668 --> 03:45.796
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- And you can always take off
the skirt and use it as a cape.

03:45.871 --> 03:48.931
So I think this is the best
costume for the day.

03:49.008 --> 03:51.533
- <i>Okay.</i>
- [Laughs]

03:51.610 --> 03:54.773
I have to think
these things up, you know.

03:56.448 --> 04:00.179
Mother wanted me to come out
in a kimono, so we had quite a fight.

04:00.252 --> 04:03.483
So what did you do, photograph Brooks
cutting right down here?

04:03.555 --> 04:06.752
- <i>Yeah, I've been through the jungle.</i>
- Oh, for goodness sakes.

04:06.825 --> 04:10.556
What do you want to do now?
Where do you want to go? Upstairs?

04:10.629 --> 04:13.826
Do you want to go up
and photograph it from the top porch?

04:13.899 --> 04:15.833
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay.

04:15.901 --> 04:19.769
They're gonna photograph
from the top now, Brooks.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.610
<i>[David]</i>
<i>It's a beautiful garden back here.</i>

04:33.685 --> 04:35.915
Did you see the wall garden?

04:35.988 --> 04:38.320
- Oh, you mean the patio.
You mean this.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

04:38.390 --> 04:42.520
<i>That's a Spanish wall garden</i>
<i>over there, you know.</i>

04:42.594 --> 04:44.824
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>
- <i>The Hills put that in.</i>

04:44.897 --> 04:46.865
<i>They imported</i>
<i>everything from Rome.</i>

04:46.932 --> 04:50.561
Mrs. Hill, she was
a famous horticulturist.

04:53.205 --> 04:56.265
That was one of the famous
gardens of America.

04:56.341 --> 04:58.605
<i>Brooks, next summer,</i>
<i>if we're all living,</i>

04:58.677 --> 05:01.475
<i>I think a vegetable garden</i>
<i>would be a good thing in here.</i>

05:01.547 --> 05:03.674
You don't get
enough sunlight in here.

05:03.749 --> 05:09.381
<i>Yeah, Mother says she doesn't mind</i>
<i>if you have to cut down some privet</i>
<i>for the garden.</i>

05:09.455 --> 05:12.151
- <i>Would be nice.</i>
- Yeah.

05:12.224 --> 05:17.787
Because food's going up.
We heard that on the radio last night.

05:17.863 --> 05:23.267
<i>Do you think my costume</i>
<i>looked all right for Brooks?</i>
<i>I think he was a little amazed.</i>

05:23.335 --> 05:27.465
- <i>He's probably seen it before.</i>
- No, no. This is
the revolutionary costume.

05:27.539 --> 05:30.474
I never wear this in East Hampton.

05:32.845 --> 05:35.871
<i>[David] He seems okay.</i>
<i>He seems like he can handle it.</i>

05:35.948 --> 05:39.213
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>You can't be too careful.</i>
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

05:39.284 --> 05:42.583
That was
the original living room.

05:44.389 --> 05:47.586
You know, people go back
to a kitchen now.

05:47.659 --> 05:51.117
Though the washing machine was always
put in the maids' dining room.

05:51.196 --> 05:54.461
You know, the washtubs are
in the maids' dining room.

05:55.868 --> 05:58.302
- <i>Let's go up.</i>
- It's very difficult...

05:58.370 --> 06:01.134
to keep the line between
the past and the present.

06:01.206 --> 06:04.141
Do you know what I mean?
It's awfully difficult.

06:14.753 --> 06:17.722
<i>[Mrs. Beale] That is</i>
<i>a beautiful ocean today, isn't it?</i>

06:17.789 --> 06:20.952
<i>What color would you say</i>
<i>that was? Sort of sapphire?</i>

06:22.161 --> 06:24.994
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like that ocean.</i>

06:25.063 --> 06:27.998
<i>The 50 years I've been here...</i>

06:28.066 --> 06:30.830
<i>the best in 50 years.</i>

06:30.903 --> 06:35.101
<i>Oh, Edie, are you around?</i>

06:35.174 --> 06:38.371
- <i>Oh, Edie!</i>
- <i>I haven't been out of this</i>
<i>goddamn horrible place...</i>

06:38.443 --> 06:40.377
in two years.

06:40.445 --> 06:42.970
God, if you knew how I felt.
I'm ready to kill.

06:43.048 --> 06:45.243
<i>Well, they're not going</i>
<i>to take you to the beach.</i>

06:45.317 --> 06:48.081
- Brooks wants his...
his check, Mother darling.
- <i>All right, give me the...</i>

06:48.153 --> 06:50.485
- He's at the door.
- <i>I told you I should do it now.</i>

06:50.556 --> 06:53.525
Twenty-four bucks for three cuttings.
Just a minute.

06:53.592 --> 06:55.787
<i>I told you...</i>
<i>Better bring the pen.</i>

06:55.861 --> 06:57.954
<i>I locked all the cats away.</i>

06:58.030 --> 07:02.057
- <i>[Cats Meowing]</i>
- Don't be so mean.
They don't wanna be locked away.

07:02.134 --> 07:05.763
The poor little kitties.
You know kitties adore sun.

07:10.042 --> 07:13.205
I suppose I won't get out
of here till she dies or I die.

07:13.278 --> 07:16.441
- Who's she? The cat?
- I don't know when
I'm gonna get out of here.

07:16.515 --> 07:19.609
- Why do you want to get out?
Another place'd be much worse.
- 'Cause I don't like it.

07:19.685 --> 07:21.744
- Any place will be much worse.
- Here.

07:21.820 --> 07:24.414
- Any place on earth.
- Yeah, but I like freedom.

07:24.489 --> 07:27.856
Well, you can't get it, darling.
You're being supported.

07:27.926 --> 07:31.089
- You can't get any freedom
when you're being supported.
- <i>Yeah, but...</i>

07:31.163 --> 07:33.290
- You can't?
- <i>No, you can't.</i>

07:33.365 --> 07:36.801
- I think you're not free when
you're not being supported.
- <i>You have to toe the mark.</i>

07:36.868 --> 07:39.598
- It's awful both ways.
- <i>Well, you don't look it.</i>

07:39.671 --> 07:43.038
<i>You look very young</i>
<i>for 56 years of age.</i>

07:43.108 --> 07:45.269
<i>Don't you remember</i>
<i>what you told</i> me...

07:45.344 --> 07:48.404
- I'd just like a couple of days
on the beach, that's all.
- <i>What was it you told me?</i>

07:48.480 --> 07:53.417
- <i>Twenty-four bucks.</i>
- You don't have to scream that out.

07:53.485 --> 07:56.977
When are you gonna learn, Edie?
You're in this world, you know.

07:57.055 --> 07:59.546
You're not out of the world.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.650
<i>[Edie Sighs]</i>

08:01.727 --> 08:05.128
Let's see if I can remember the date.
Is it the 12th today?

08:05.197 --> 08:09.361
- <i>Well, there are certain</i>
<i>compensations, I guess.</i>
- Is it the 12th today?

08:12.771 --> 08:16.002
The old woman, she has to remember
everything, you know that.

08:17.175 --> 08:19.405
I think this is correct.

08:22.147 --> 08:25.082
Brooks Hiers. H-I-E-R-S.

08:25.150 --> 08:28.085
- <i>Oh, I didn't think it was necessary.</i>
- Yes.

08:28.153 --> 08:31.611
Why didn't you let me
do this in the house for?
Why did you make me do it here?

08:31.690 --> 08:34.250
<i>Mother, you don't have</i>
<i>enough clothes on.</i>

08:34.326 --> 08:37.419
Well, I hope... I'm gonna get naked in
just a minute, so you better watch out.

08:37.496 --> 08:40.522
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- <i>Yeah, for what? Now, why?</i>

08:40.599 --> 08:43.591
- <i>I haven't got any warts on me.</i>
- But the movie, the movie.

08:43.669 --> 08:47.036
- <i>I haven't got any warts on me.</i>
- That isn't the point, Mother darling.

08:47.105 --> 08:50.074
<i>Well, you know where you got,</i>
<i>being like that.</i>

08:50.142 --> 08:52.235
<i>No husband, no babies, nothing.</i>

08:52.311 --> 08:54.575
I can't help it.
I like to wear certain things.

08:54.646 --> 08:58.173
- <i>Is that H-Y-E-R? H-Y?</i>
- She likes everything without girdles.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.811
- <i>H- Y, Edie, or H-I?</i>
- H-Y-E-R-S.

09:01.887 --> 09:03.821
- H-Y?
- Yeah.

09:05.223 --> 09:08.124
She and Marjorie don't believe
in wearing girdles.

09:08.193 --> 09:10.787
I haven't worn a girdle
since I was 12 years old.

09:10.862 --> 09:13.296
- Here you are.
- Mother has certain ideas about, uh...

09:13.365 --> 09:16.823
- I certainly have certain ideas
about living a long time.
- <i>About clothes.</i>

09:16.902 --> 09:20.099
- That's what I got ideas about.
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>

09:20.172 --> 09:24.666
It's very hard to live nowadays.
Living is very difficult.

09:28.647 --> 09:33.277
"The Libra husband
is not an easy man to please.

09:35.153 --> 09:39.214
"The monotony of domesticity
is not to his liking,

09:39.291 --> 09:44.251
but he is a passionate man
and a respecter of tradition."

09:45.964 --> 09:49.229
All I have to do
is find this Libra man.

09:50.502 --> 09:54.438
"The Libra husband is reasonable.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.667
"He is a born judge,

09:56.742 --> 09:59.711
"and no other zodiacal type...

09:59.778 --> 10:03.214
"can... order his life...

10:03.281 --> 10:05.909
with so much wisdom."

10:05.984 --> 10:09.351
My God!
That's all I need... order.

10:10.856 --> 10:13.347
That's all I need...
an ordered life.

10:13.425 --> 10:15.723
You know, a manager.

10:15.794 --> 10:18.354
But he's got to be a Libran.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.267
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hello.</i>

10:23.335 --> 10:25.166
Yeah?

10:26.772 --> 10:30.003
- <i>That sounds like Jerry.</i>
- Oh, is that Jerry?
For goodness sakes.

10:30.075 --> 10:33.408
- <i>[Edie Laughing]</i>
- What are you doing?

10:33.478 --> 10:36.072
Jerry, you're
Aquarius, aren't you?

10:36.148 --> 10:38.639
<i>That's what I saw</i>
<i>when I met you, Jerry.</i>

10:38.717 --> 10:41.242
- <i>Remember I said the Marble Faun,</i>
<i>and it was terrible.</i>
- Yeah.

10:41.319 --> 10:46.256
Terrible, the tragedy
connected with the Marble Faun.

10:46.324 --> 10:52.058
- You know, I call Jerry
"the Marble Faun."
- <i>Nathaniel Hawthorne.</i>

10:52.130 --> 10:54.064
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

10:54.132 --> 10:56.123
Do you have
that book here, Edie?

10:56.201 --> 10:58.396
<i>I haven't been able</i>
<i>to find it.</i>

10:58.470 --> 11:01.462
If you run across it,
I'd like to read it.

11:01.540 --> 11:05.601
<i>It's very deep. I don't know whether</i>
<i>you... Well, I guess you're up to it.</i>

11:05.677 --> 11:07.872
They used to have it
on all the, uh...

11:07.946 --> 11:11.848
I think it was on the high school
reading <i>list. The Marble Faun.</i>

11:11.917 --> 11:16.854
<i>"The Libra husband</i>
<i>does not seek divorce...</i>

11:16.922 --> 11:20.722
<i>"unless the conditions of his life...</i>

11:20.792 --> 11:22.726
are not adjustable."

11:22.794 --> 11:26.252
I don't believe in divorce at all.

11:26.331 --> 11:28.799
- I think divorce...
- <i>Was your mother divorced or no?</i>

11:28.867 --> 11:30.801
- No.
- <i>Separated.</i>

11:30.869 --> 11:34.965
Yes, and then my father got a,
got a fake Mexican divorce,

11:35.040 --> 11:39.704
and he... did have, you know,
what he called another wife.

11:39.778 --> 11:43.373
But we didn't recognize it. It wasn't
recognized by the Catholic Church.

11:43.448 --> 11:45.382
They don't recognize it,
you know.

11:45.450 --> 11:49.819
Say, are you bossing me around, Edie?
All afternoon?

11:49.888 --> 11:52.880
- <i>[Edie] I think that's terrific.</i>
- Oh, Edie, it's not the best one.

11:52.958 --> 11:56.325
<i>This is the worst one</i>
<i>of my wedding pictures.</i>

11:56.394 --> 11:58.862
<i>The others look worse.</i>

11:58.930 --> 12:02.422
<i>I was gonna be a singer, you know.</i>
<i>A professional singer.</i>

12:02.501 --> 12:04.731
<i>When I met Mr. Beale,</i>
<i>the jig was up.</i>

12:04.803 --> 12:06.737
<i>Do you remember this?</i>

12:06.805 --> 12:10.536
- May I see that, please?
- <i>The villain of the piece.</i>

12:10.609 --> 12:13.703
"To my best friend and
most delightful comrade,

12:13.778 --> 12:16.872
<i>"to my only sweetheart</i>

<i>Phelan Beale, 1929. "</i>

12:23.388 --> 12:26.016
- <i>So we did love each other.</i>
- <i>Did I laugh when I read that.</i>

12:26.091 --> 12:28.787
<i>Aren't kids terrible?</i>
<i>I just roared.</i>

12:28.860 --> 12:32.352
<i>When the people don't speak,</i>
<i>they never get divorced.</i>

12:32.430 --> 12:35.422
- <i>You just can't tell.</i>
- <i>I've been a very happy woman</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

12:35.500 --> 12:37.627
<i>Shall I tell them about Gould?</i>

12:37.702 --> 12:39.795
<i>Gould was Mother's accompanist.</i>

12:39.871 --> 12:44.308
<i>He was a boogie-woogie composer</i>
<i>who had the most terrific style.</i>

12:44.376 --> 12:46.810
<i>He was the most brilliant man</i>
<i>I've ever met.</i>

12:46.878 --> 12:49.472
<i>That's including Mr. Beale</i>
<i>and Mr. Bouvier.</i>

12:49.548 --> 12:51.846

24:50.568 --> 24:52.536
<i>Cute. Think, really think.</i>

24:52.603 --> 24:57.472
And third:
Believe, really believe.

24:57.541 --> 25:00.942
- [Radio Tuning]
- Well, you may say,
"How many times do I have to try?"

25:01.012 --> 25:04.140
Why, it may be
a good many times.

25:04.215 --> 25:08.811
<i>For example, I have in my pocket here</i>
<i>a letter from a man in London, England.</i>

25:08.886 --> 25:12.117
<i>"Dear Dr. Peale,</i>
<i>Over three years ago...</i>

25:12.189 --> 25:15.283
<i>"I was in your great Marble</i>
<i>Collegiate Church for the first time...</i>

25:15.359 --> 25:18.760
<i>"and I was having it rough.</i>

25:18.829 --> 25:22.629
- [Snickers]
- <i>"The job I'd been doing</i>
<i>had come to an end, and I was 55.</i>

25:22.700 --> 25:25.260
- [Laughing]
- <i>[Mrs. Beale] Your age, old gal.</i>

25:25.336 --> 25:28.271
<i>"Your suggestion lived with me,</i>
<i>plus the advice to try, really try, ;</i>

25:28.339 --> 25:31.831
- He lived. I never lived.
- <i>"think, really think, ;
<i>believe, really believe.</i></i>

25:31.909 --> 25:36.937
"I did think. I did work
very hard to find a job.

25:37.014 --> 25:41.144
Eighty-eight interviews."

25:41.218 --> 25:43.948
So did he
or did he not get the job?

25:44.021 --> 25:46.148
He did.

25:46.223 --> 25:49.215
Will he or will not
handle himself...

25:49.293 --> 25:52.160
<i>in the years that are to come?</i>

25:52.229 --> 25:55.130
<i>He wasn't emotional.</i>

25:55.199 --> 25:58.168
<i>He didn't get upset.</i>

25:58.235 --> 26:01.671
- <i>He wasn't nervous.</i>
- He wasn't me.

26:01.739 --> 26:06.676
<i>He was cool.</i>
<i>Now one thing is sure:</i>

26:06.744 --> 26:12.512
<i>The human mind will not function</i>
<i>when it is hot.</i>

26:14.685 --> 26:20.282
- Only when it is cool
and dispassionate...
- <i>Dispassionate.</i>

26:20.358 --> 26:22.656
- That was the word
I wanted to other day.
- <i>will it produce.</i>

26:22.727 --> 26:25.093
I couldn't think
of what it was.

26:25.162 --> 26:28.723
I think it would be a good idea
if every day every individual...

26:28.799 --> 26:31.791
<i>would look at himself</i>
<i>in the mirror,</i>

26:31.869 --> 26:35.703
<i>earnestly,</i>
<i>and ask the question,</i>

26:35.773 --> 26:39.675
<i>"Who am I?</i>
<i>Am I a weak person?</i>

26:39.744 --> 26:43.805
<i>Am I a defeated person?</i>
<i>Am I an inferior person?"</i>

26:43.881 --> 26:46.441
<i>Not at all.</i>

26:46.517 --> 26:50.214
<i>I am a child of God,</i>

26:50.287 --> 26:55.350
<i>and I was intended</i>
<i>to get on top of things...</i>

26:55.426 --> 27:00.261
<i>and I was intended to stay there.</i>

27:02.333 --> 27:05.928
- <i>♪ Amen, amen ♪
- <i>Very good. That was very long.</i></i>

27:06.003 --> 27:09.063
- Very long.
- You notice how he went
on and on and on?

27:09.140 --> 27:12.837
Let's hear the prayer.
I mean the song. You sing the song now.

27:12.910 --> 27:15.003
- Doxology.
- <i>Sing it.</i>

27:15.079 --> 27:17.479
<i>[Announcer] You have been listening</i>
<i>to Dr. Norman Vincent Peale...</i>

27:17.548 --> 27:20.574
- <i>as he spoke this morning</i>
<i>from his pulpit...</i>
- <i>No emotionalism.</i>

27:20.651 --> 27:23.984
- <i>at Marble Collegiate Church.</i>
- Never give up.
You want to keep on top.

27:24.054 --> 27:26.921
Way up high up on top.

27:26.991 --> 27:29.323
Wonderful way
to smother somebody.

27:29.393 --> 27:32.760
<i>[Laughing] Would you pass</i>
<i>your mirror over here?</i>

27:32.830 --> 27:36.027
<i>I've got to see what I look like.</i>

27:36.100 --> 27:39.661
- [Laughing]
- Don't drop it.

27:43.007 --> 27:45.373
- Uptight.
- <i>That was wonderful.</i>

27:45.443 --> 27:47.968
<i>I see why I've got cataracts.</i>

27:48.045 --> 27:50.343
I have astigmatism,
one eye pulled against the other,

27:50.414 --> 27:52.609
and I should've worn glasses
and I didn't.

27:52.683 --> 27:55.277
- <i>Oh, I told you to wear glasses.</i>
- Is there anything else
you want to know?

27:55.352 --> 27:58.287
- <i>You got with the glasses</i>
<i>about four years ago.</i>
- I'll tell you about my teeth.

27:58.355 --> 28:01.791
<i>Four years ago, Edie. You got</i>
<i>the glasses, and you didn't wear them.</i>

28:01.859 --> 28:05.488
- My teeth are still all right.
- <i>You have to wear the glasses</i>
<i>when, when you have any trouble.</i>

28:05.563 --> 28:07.793
<i>You have to.</i>

28:07.865 --> 28:09.890
[Laughs]

28:09.967 --> 28:14.870
And my hair will grow...
I hope. Here.

28:20.978 --> 28:23.037
<i>[David]</i>
<i>You're dressed for battle, Edie.</i>

28:23.113 --> 28:27.106
Mother's telling Marjorie how
spoiled I am, how terrible I am.

28:27.184 --> 28:30.347
And Marjorie knew my father
and my uncle and everybody.

28:30.421 --> 28:32.753
Mother's giving her
all this S-H-I-T,

28:32.823 --> 28:36.054
so I went and told her
some things about the family.

28:36.126 --> 28:39.493
But, you see,
in dealing with me...

28:39.563 --> 28:42.760
the relatives didn't know...

28:42.833 --> 28:46.200
that they were dealing
with a <i>staunch</i> character.

28:46.270 --> 28:50.070
And I tell you, if there's anything
worse than a staunch woman...

28:50.140 --> 28:53.940
S-T-A-U-N-C-H.

28:54.011 --> 28:57.003
There's nothing worse,
I'm telling you.

28:57.081 --> 28:59.208
[Sighs]

28:59.283 --> 29:03.014
They don't weaken... no matter what.

29:05.222 --> 29:09.784
But they didn't know that.
Well, how were they to know?

29:09.860 --> 29:14.320
You know, my father had made up his mind
about what Farmington produced...

29:14.398 --> 29:16.866
and what the
Sacred Heart Convent produced.

29:16.934 --> 29:19.698
I don't think he was so down
on the Spence School,

29:19.770 --> 29:22.364
but he certainly was down
on Farmington.

29:22.439 --> 29:25.272
I don't know why.
Farmington was a junior college.

29:25.342 --> 29:27.810
You could choose
what you wanted to study.

29:27.878 --> 29:30.574
Perhaps that was what made
my father dislike it so...

29:30.648 --> 29:32.639
that I could choose.

29:32.716 --> 29:35.947
But I chose what I thought
he'd want me to choose...

29:36.020 --> 29:39.251
you know,
English literature and...

29:39.323 --> 29:42.690
Oriental philosophies and, uh...

29:42.760 --> 29:46.753
well, I always took French,
but nothing ever happened there.

29:46.830 --> 29:50.266
I can read and write in French,
but I can't speak it.

29:50.334 --> 29:54.532
I had years and years
and years of French.

29:54.605 --> 29:56.903
Terrible.
[Laughs]

29:59.176 --> 30:03.738
<i>This was taken by Amy Dupont</i>
<i>at my last year in Farmington.</i>

30:03.814 --> 30:05.782
<i>I was 17.</i>

30:05.849 --> 30:08.545
- <i>[David] Edie, that's so beautiful.</i>
- <i>Mr. Wainwright did that.</i>

30:08.619 --> 30:12.680
<i>He was an artist from a very good</i>
<i>family. He was in the social register.</i>

30:12.756 --> 30:17.284
<i>He did it in the solarium</i>

30:17.361 --> 30:20.524

<i>I was in a fashion show.</i>

30:20.598 --> 30:23.123
- <i>[Laughs]</i>
- <i>[Mrs. Beale] Let me see that.</i>

30:23.200 --> 30:25.191
<i>[Albert]</i>
<i>Oh, beautiful. Look at that, David.</i>

30:25.269 --> 30:27.601
- <i>[Mrs. Beale] May I see that?</i>
- <i>Wow! Look at that.</i>

30:27.671 --> 30:30.299
<i>[Edie] I thought I was</i>
<i>the cat's pajamas in that!</i>

30:30.374 --> 30:33.707
<i>[Mrs. Beale] You did, Edie. See how</i>
<i>pretty Edie was when she was young?</i>

30:33.777 --> 30:36.644
<i>It's perfectly foolish of her</i>
<i>not to look that way now.</i>

30:36.714 --> 30:40.275
<i>She could, you know, if she</i>
<i>didn't worry about everything.</i>

30:40.351 --> 30:44.048
<i>Didn't she look like a girl</i>
<i>that had everything? Huh?</i>

30:45.723 --> 30:47.657
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>This has inspired me.</i>

30:47.725 --> 30:51.024
<i>I'll have to get another</i>
<i>brown tailored suit and grow my hair.</i>

30:51.095 --> 30:53.620
<i>My God, I have no hair.</i>

30:53.697 --> 30:57.326
<i>[Mrs. Beale] You never put any</i>
<i>lipstick on for this picture, did you?</i>

30:57.401 --> 31:00.666
- I have another kind on.
- <i>You look horrible.</i>

31:00.738 --> 31:03.172
<i>Why didn't you put</i>
<i>lipstick and makeup on?</i>

31:03.240 --> 31:06.175

<i>He didn't say to get out</i>
<i>of that family situation,</i>

<i>"You need a job, Miss Beale."</i>

31:19.823 --> 31:22.792
<i>[David] Didn't you expect that Edie</i>

31:22.860 --> 31:24.953
<i>[Mrs. Beale]</i>
<i>Oh, I did. I wanted her to.</i>

31:25.029 --> 31:27.793
<i>Oh, I picked out some nice men.</i>
<i>She didn't like the men I picked out.</i>

31:27.865 --> 31:29.799
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>They were horrible.</i>

31:29.867 --> 31:32.301
<i>[Mrs. Beale] She could have married</i>

31:32.369 --> 31:34.894
<i>He was a millionaire, ;
<i>he gave her a gorgeous ring.</i></i>

31:34.972 --> 31:38.169
<i>She decided not to marry that guy.</i>
<i>She had to give the ring back.</i>

31:38.242 --> 31:41.405
<i>She has a proposal of marriage</i>
<i>from Paul Getty.</i>

31:41.478 --> 31:43.969
<i>Remember Paul,</i>
<i>the richest man in the world?</i>

31:44.048 --> 31:45.982
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>He married Teddy Lynch.</i>

31:46.050 --> 31:48.314
<i>[Mrs. Beale] Then you could</i>
<i>have married Jordan McClanahan.</i>

31:48.385 --> 31:51.081
<i>He was another millionaire,</i>
<i>and he wanted to marry you.</i>

31:51.155 --> 31:54.591
<i>She just didn't want to get married.</i>
<i>That's all blamed on me.</i>

31:54.658 --> 31:57.320
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>No, I never fell in love until I was 31.</i>

31:57.394 --> 31:59.658
<i>[Mrs. Beale] Well, how old</i>
<i>are you in these pictures?</i>

31:59.730 --> 32:01.823
- <i>Twenty-four.</i>
- <i>Twenty-four. That old?</i>

32:01.899 --> 32:04.333
- <i>1940.</i>
- <i>Very young looking for twenty-four.</i>

32:04.401 --> 32:07.461
<i>France had just fallen...</i>
<i>to Hitler.</i>

32:07.538 --> 32:10.439
- <i>But you never fell for a man.</i>
- <i>Paris, Paris, excuse me.</i>

32:10.507 --> 32:13.408
<i>France fell,</i>
<i>but Edie didn't fall.</i>

32:16.747 --> 32:19.215
<i>That was the thing.</i>
<i>See,</i> I...

32:19.283 --> 32:21.808
They didn't tell us that
when we studied World War I,

32:21.885 --> 32:25.082
that everything was so awful
with the Versailles Treaty,

32:25.155 --> 32:29.592
that we were soon going to get into
something four years after I got out.

32:29.660 --> 32:32.686
If I'd only known it,
I would have just...

32:32.763 --> 32:36.460
just enjoyed every single minute,
just done everything.

32:36.533 --> 32:39.366
<i>[David] It must've been tough</i>
<i>on people. I remember as a kid...</i>

32:39.436 --> 32:41.802
<i>so many loved ones being killed.</i>

32:41.872 --> 32:43.965
<i>But you were the dating age.</i>

32:44.041 --> 32:46.566
<i>A lot of my friends went</i>
<i>overseas and got married.</i>

32:46.643 --> 32:49.737
They went in the Red Cross.
They went to India, Australia.

32:49.813 --> 32:52.145
They all got married.

32:52.216 --> 32:55.811
<i>One of my best friends</i>
<i>went to Australia.</i>

32:55.886 --> 33:00.346
<i>If I'd have been able to go, she</i>
<i>might have persuaded me to go with her.</i>

33:00.424 --> 33:03.416
And she met somebody
in the hospital.

33:03.494 --> 33:08.625
She was working for the Red Cross,
and she never came back to New York.

33:08.699 --> 33:11.463
But I never had a chance
to do anything like that...

33:11.535 --> 33:14.368
'cause Mother wasn't well
during the war.

33:14.438 --> 33:17.669
She had her eye operation.

33:17.741 --> 33:20.232
<i>I missed out on everything.</i>

33:20.310 --> 33:24.576
<i>I missed out on the reunion</i>
<i>of my graduating class in Farmington...</i>

33:24.648 --> 33:29.017
because that was the fall that
Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in...

33:29.086 --> 33:33.489
and I was stuck here with Mother,
the cats, the house and T. Logan...

33:33.557 --> 33:35.491
and I couldn't go.

33:35.559 --> 33:40.258
- No, you said you didn't want them
to know how old you were.
- <i>The 25th reunion of my class.</i>

33:40.330 --> 33:43.697
- <i>No, I think...</i>
- "Well, I didn't want them
to know my age," says Edie.

33:43.767 --> 33:48.670
<i>No, I would have enjoyed that, Mother,</i>
<i>because Jack Kennedy campaigned</i>
<i>to get in and won.</i>

33:48.739 --> 33:52.300
Get in the Farmington School?
That'd be a good place for him.

33:52.376 --> 33:55.470
<i>I don't know. I think</i>
<i>it would have been a lot of fun.</i>

33:55.546 --> 33:58.709
Yeah, everything's good
that you didn't do.

33:58.782 --> 34:01.444
At the time,
you didn't want it.

34:01.518 --> 34:03.986
- <i>I couldn't get away.</i>
- Well, that's the choice.

34:04.054 --> 34:07.751
- You can't go back and say...
feel gorgeous right now...
- I couldn't leave.

34:07.825 --> 34:10.658
- <i>and say, "Oh, why didn't I do this?"</i>
- I couldn't leave.

34:10.726 --> 34:14.163
<i>Because you didn't feel then</i>
<i>the way you do now.</i>

34:14.231 --> 34:18.860
<i>Everybody thinks and feels differently</i>
<i>as the years go by, don't they?</i>

34:18.936 --> 34:20.870
- Yeah.
- <i>Yes.</i>

34:20.938 --> 34:23.498
- What time is it, chickens?
- <i>[David] What time is it?</i>

34:23.574 --> 34:25.599
- I want to go in now.
- <i>It's, uh, 1:30.</i>

34:25.676 --> 34:28.371
- I may need David's hand to get up.
- <i>You have it.</i>

34:28.445 --> 34:31.505
Where is it?
Can you come around this way?

34:31.581 --> 34:33.708
- Sure.
- Are you taking pictures?

34:33.784 --> 34:36.911
Always. Here.

34:36.987 --> 34:40.353
<i>[Edie]</i>

"pondering one I took the other...

34:50.534 --> 34:52.900

34:52.969 --> 34:55.404
- <i>[Mrs. Beale] Robert Frost.</i>
- Isn't that wonderful?

34:55.472 --> 34:58.464
- <i>Did he say that?</i>
- That's all you need...
just three lines like that.

34:58.542 --> 35:01.477
- <i>Come on, Edie, is that Robert Frost?</i>
- Who else?

35:01.545 --> 35:03.809
<i>I thought it was you.</i>
<i>I think your poetry is better.</i>

35:03.881 --> 35:06.315
- "Two road diverged in yellow wood...

- "And pondering one, I took the other.

- And that made all the difference."

35:13.223 --> 35:16.090
- <i>We don't want to learn it.</i>
<i>It's very pretty.</i>
- Isn't that amazing?

35:16.159 --> 35:18.525
No, I don't think it's
half as good as your poems.

practicing the, uh...
the marching song.

- <i>[Albert] Great.</i>
- My God, my muscles!

He couldn't do any work. He made good
salads, but he was drunk all the time.

- <i>No, I deserve...</i>

- Because the work

59:42.124 --> 59:47.152
I'll take a dog any day.
[Chuckles]

59:47.229 --> 59:52.326
Why didn't you marry the man
you wanted to, like I did?

59:52.401 --> 59:56.497
I think the saddest thing was my not
marrying into the Obelensky family...

59:56.572 --> 59:59.336
'cause I adore them.

59:59.408 --> 01:00:02.844
- <i>Any Obelensky is wonderful.</i>
<i>That's all I can say.</i>
- He's a very sweet man.

01:00:02.911 --> 01:00:05.641
<i>If he's related to</i>
<i>the Obelenskys, he's okay.</i>

01:00:05.714 --> 01:00:07.978
- I didn't know he was
any relation to them.
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:11.417
- I never knew it.
- <i>Serge's, uh, nephew by his half-sister.</i>

01:00:11.487 --> 01:00:13.819
Now, there was a boy
I might have married.

01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:15.914
Why didn't you marry
Paul Getty?

01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:17.982
<i>I said, "How did you</i>
<i>happen to come here?"</i>

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.961
<i>And he said, "Oh, I saw you at a dance,"</i>
<i>he said, "in South Hampton."</i>

01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:23.623
- I said, "You did?" He said, "Yes."
- <i>He was just a kid.</i>

01:00:23.699 --> 01:00:26.930
<i>He was 32. And I said,</i>
<i>"Eugene, what you need is a girl."</i>

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:30.438
<i>And he said, "No, Edith, I'm looking</i>
<i>for a wife. I wanna get married. "</i>

01:00:30.506 --> 01:00:34.533
- He wanted to take Edie to Westchester.
- Wasn't that cute?

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:38.671
<i>Tom had just died, and I did not</i>
<i>want another man in my kitchen.</i>

01:00:38.747 --> 01:00:42.376
- <i>I went downstairs...</i>
- He'd just made a cookbook.
He'd just written a cookbook.

01:00:42.451 --> 01:00:45.784
- Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes.
- <i>Don't want any cookbooks.</i>

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:49.517
Mother got rid of him
in 15 minutes because he came
from a celebrated family.

01:00:49.591 --> 01:00:54.528
The Tyszkiewicz family.
And I suppose mother didn't want me
to have anybody that was decent.

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:56.723
- You understand.
- <i>I didn't want anybody in the kitchen.</i>

01:00:56.799 --> 01:01:00.291
It would have been perfectly
all right for me to marry Tom Logan.

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:02.337
<i>Why did you want to marry</i>
<i>a kid 32?</i>

01:01:02.404 --> 01:01:05.931
- I forgot to say
that Eugene was a count.
- <i>He didn't have a nickel.</i>

01:01:06.008 --> 01:01:09.136
I would have been Countess...
Countess Edith.

01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:13.705
<i>I didn't want my child to be taken away.</i>
<i>I'd be entirely alone.</i>

01:01:17.886 --> 01:01:21.845
Do you know what I go through
with this awful stuff?

01:01:21.924 --> 01:01:25.325
<i>Listen, I've got to eat lunch.</i>
<i>I'm starving.</i>

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:27.658
Well, you know me...
always hungry.

01:01:27.729 --> 01:01:30.425
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- I'm not gonna gain the weight back.

01:01:30.499 --> 01:01:33.491
<i>I didn't have any breakfast.</i>

01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:36.595
- I'll put some lipstick on.
- <i>You want to give me something</i>
<i>to put on, Edie?</i>

01:01:36.672 --> 01:01:39.140
[Giggles]
I'm beginning to laugh.

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:44.504
- These are my brother's drawers.
- <i>Give me something to put on.</i>

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:50.212
<i>And I feel so strongly about mementos</i>
<i>and everything because of Mother...</i>

01:01:50.285 --> 01:01:54.688
<i>that I was never able to ever</i>
<i>clean out these desk drawers</i>
<i>and throw the stuff away.</i>

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:59.591
- Would you believe that?
You know, it's childhood stuff.
- <i>[Mrs. Beale, Indistinct]</i>

01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:03.927
- <i>Oh, Edie, yoo-hoo!</i>
- "Memorabalia" or something.

01:02:03.999 --> 01:02:06.934
- <i>Edie, yoo-hoo!</i>
- I couldn't throw anything away.

01:02:07.002 --> 01:02:09.664
- They're looking at this room.
- <i>Oh, Edie!</i>

01:02:09.738 --> 01:02:11.729
Yeah, just a minute.

01:02:11.807 --> 01:02:14.435
They discovered something
terrific in here.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.536
- <i>Come on. I've waited long enough.</i>
- Is it from Austria?

01:02:17.613 --> 01:02:21.344
- <i>Why, what happened?</i>
- <i>Never mind about me.</i>

01:02:23.685 --> 01:02:28.019
<i>[Edie] "The moving finger writes</i>
<i>and, having writ, moves on. "</i>

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:31.321

<i>Edie, yoo-hoo!</i>

01:02:37.533 --> 01:02:40.331
- Well, I got that one up.
- <i>Edie, bring me the telephone.</i>

01:02:40.402 --> 01:02:43.894
That's the man.
This is the woman.

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:47.271
- I can't tell.
- <i>Are you getting me</i>
<i>the blue kimono, Edie?</i>

01:02:47.342 --> 01:02:51.244
I'm putting up the silver masks.

01:02:51.313 --> 01:02:53.247
<i>Edie, come here a minute. Hurry.</i>

01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:55.943
I can't get the thumbtack
in the wall.

01:02:56.018 --> 01:02:59.510
- I think I have the saddest life.
- <i>Oh, Edie!</i>

01:02:59.588 --> 01:03:03.080
I have to go on with
the redecoration of this room.

01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:05.820
- Yeah.
- <i>Can you get me something to eat?</i>

01:03:05.894 --> 01:03:07.828
All right.

01:03:14.436 --> 01:03:16.427
<i>[Edie]</i>
<i>I made this.</i>

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:21.135
<i>Those are roses</i>
<i>of all different years.</i>

01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:26.272
<i>That's my shell collection.</i>
<i>You can't see it, it's so dirty.</i>
<i>Isn't that tragic?</i>

01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:30.250
That's... These...
Then I have two things to go there.

01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:32.753
And "Around the World"
is supposed to go there.

01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:34.755
<i>Edie, I can't do it.</i>

01:03:38.293 --> 01:03:42.093
- <i>Open it. I can't do it.</i>
- I'm just gonna put that up there...

01:03:42.164 --> 01:03:44.894
'cause I like red
in this room for some reason.

01:03:44.967 --> 01:03:49.199
And I was gonna hang
the birdcage right here...

01:03:49.271 --> 01:03:52.001
and have
"Around the World" there.

01:03:52.074 --> 01:03:54.542
But I haven't gotten to that.

01:03:56.511 --> 01:04:00.242
<i>Perhaps I'd better begin taking</i>
<i>care of Mother and bossing her</i>
<i>and cooking her some food.</i>

01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:02.681
- <i>What do you boys think?</i>
- <i>[David] Bossing her around?</i>

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:05.413
Yeah.
I let her do what she wants.

01:04:05.487 --> 01:04:09.617
I think maybe I ought to give her
cooked meals at certain hours.

01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:13.457
What do you think?
I don't have any clock.

01:04:13.528 --> 01:04:16.326
You know,
I never know what time it is.

01:04:18.834 --> 01:04:20.927
You think she'd eat them?

01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:23.699
<i>I don't know. You know her</i>
<i>better than anybody.</i>

01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:27.538
I give her her head. I let her do what
she wants to do. I think it's awful.

01:04:29.578 --> 01:04:34.948
She should eat, you know,
chopped meat and a baked potato
at a certain hour for luncheon.

01:04:35.017 --> 01:04:37.747
Then have a nice little dinner.

01:04:37.819 --> 01:04:39.753
But that takes timing.

01:05:23.532 --> 01:05:26.626
No, I'm not ready,
and I have no makeup on!

01:05:26.702 --> 01:05:29.899
- <i>[Albert Laughing]</i>
- But things are getting better!

01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:32.701

"In bathtub"?

01:05:32.774 --> 01:05:35.072
<i>Right.</i>
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:37.270
Come on in.
We're not ready.

- <i>[Albert] Yeah. Hi.</i>

01:05:41.717 --> 01:05:44.015

- Oh, God! I almost tripped.

01:05:44.086 --> 01:05:48.455

God, these stairs are dirty.

01:05:48.523 --> 01:05:51.321

How could Edie leave
these stairs like this?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.601
Don't I look funny
coming down these stairs, hmm?

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:05.071
- <i>[David] No. You look great.</i>
- Don't I? I feel funny.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.007
I feel funny.

01:06:08.076 --> 01:06:10.044
- <i>Just like a night at the opera.</i>
- Is it?

01:06:10.112 --> 01:06:13.275
The night at the opera will be when
I get in that chair in the dining room.

01:06:13.348 --> 01:06:15.441

at the opera.

<i>I thought you were gonna</i>
<i>clean up, Edie.</i>

01:06:49.718 --> 01:06:52.915

Well, I'm kind of disapp... Jack,
you don't mind sitting by me, do you?
