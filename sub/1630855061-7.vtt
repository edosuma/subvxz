19:29.170 --> 19:31.570
Whoa, that was intense.

19:31.572 --> 19:33.705
Thanks, dr. P.
No problemo, hayley,

19:33.707 --> 19:36.775
But next time we go into a show,
can it be "silver spoons"?

19:36.777 --> 19:39.044
I want to ride
that little train.

19:39.046 --> 19:41.713
Ooh,
cheese and brita water.

19:41.715 --> 19:42.848
Were you
having the queen over?

19:42.850 --> 19:44.183
That reminds me,
I should go.

19:44.185 --> 19:46.718
I need to make things right
with my friends.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.320
Cool.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.723
Back to work.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.324
-Mm.
-Mm.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.526
Oh, yeah.

19:54.528 --> 19:55.994
Oh!

19:55.996 --> 19:58.730
Well, rub rub tuggington's
business is ruined.

19:58.732 --> 20:00.199
Might as well watch.

20:00.201 --> 20:02.401
You know what? The name's
kind of growing on me.

20:02.403 --> 20:03.668
Can you leave,
roger?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.336
How about
instead of leaving,

20:05.338 --> 20:08.139
We have a race
to see who can finish first.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.908
You're on!

20:13.947 --> 20:16.681
Hey. I'm so sorry
that I ruined our night.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.818
I was just so nervous because
I-I like you guys so much,

20:19.820 --> 20:21.152
And I think you're
so cool and --

20:21.154 --> 20:23.488
Voice:<i> Whoa.</i>
<i> Slow down there, girl.</i>

20:23.490 --> 20:25.624
Let me slow down.

20:25.626 --> 20:28.760
I guess you could say I got
a little too in my own head.

20:28.762 --> 20:30.629
Hayley, you don't have
to be nervous

20:30.631 --> 20:32.163
Or apologize
for being weird.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.700
Yeah.
You have a husband and a job.

20:34.702 --> 20:37.836
We think you're the one
who's got it all figured out.

20:37.838 --> 20:40.371
Really?
Wow! I had no idea!

20:40.373 --> 20:42.641
Klaus: Danuta!

20:42.643 --> 20:45.176
Danuta! Danuta!

20:45.178 --> 20:49.514
I have to tell you something,
danuta!

20:49.516 --> 20:50.582
What?

20:50.584 --> 20:52.117
What is it, klaus?

20:52.119 --> 20:56.455
Uhhhh...

20:56.457 --> 20:58.457
Hey.

20:58.459 --> 21:00.292
Bye-bye.
See you soon.
