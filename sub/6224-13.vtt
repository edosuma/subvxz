00:02.503 --> 00:05.836
Narrator: In a land of myth
and a time of magic...

00:06.006 --> 00:07.871
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.050 --> 00:10.962
Rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.048
His name: Merlin.

00:17.142 --> 00:21.101
- The war has begun.
- It is at camlann that we make our stand.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.501
Merlin: I hoped never to hear that name
again. Gaius: If Arthur goes to camlann...

00:24.525 --> 00:27.107
The prophecy will come true
and he will die.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.438
Morgana: This war can be won.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.813
Well, eira, has sir Gwaine
been forthcoming...

00:32.991 --> 00:35.448
- About Arthur's plans?
- He's kept no secrets from me.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.531
On me!

00:39.957 --> 00:42.744
You wield a power
you cannot yet conceive of.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.077
Your destiny awaits.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.815
Gwen: Bandages!

02:31.985 --> 02:33.521
I need bandages!

03:42.055 --> 03:43.295
Emrys!

04:31.229 --> 04:33.561
For the love of Camelot!

04:46.828 --> 04:50.195
Gwen: Who is that?
- Someone truly remarkable.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.614
You know him?

04:55.295 --> 04:58.708
Let's just say
he deserves our gratitude.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.833
You gave me no choice.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.511
My lady.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.634
The battle is won.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.062
The saxons are in full retreat.
They're making for the hills.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.520
I've dispatched 200 men
to drive our advantage home.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.485
And Arthur?

07:29.407 --> 07:32.991
- We'll keep looking.
- Thank you.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.660
Oh, I'll need some fresh water.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.386
Merlin

08:37.517 --> 08:39.097
how are you feeling?

08:39.561 --> 08:41.301
- Aah!
- Easy.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.515
Lie back. Lie back.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.144
Where have you been?

08:48.153 --> 08:51.190
- It doesn't matter now.
- Oh! My si... my side.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.648
You're bleeding.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.237
That's all right. I thought I was dying.

08:59.789 --> 09:04.408
I'm sorry. I thought I'd
defied the prophecy.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.001
I thought I was in time.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.171
What are you talking about?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.842
I defeated the saxons.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.346
The dragon, and yet...

09:20.477 --> 09:22.968
And yet I knew it was mordred
that I must stop.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.354
The person who defeated them...

09:30.528 --> 09:31.938
Was the sorcerer.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.158
It was me.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.250
Don't be ridiculous, Merlin.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.920
This is stupid. Wh...?

09:56.888 --> 09:58.344
Why would you say that?”

09:59.891 --> 10:01.301
I'm...

10:09.109 --> 10:10.144
I'm a sorcerer.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.271
I have magic.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.246
And I use it for you, Arthur.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.701
- Only for you.
- Merlin, you are not a sorcerer.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.995
I would know. Look here.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.828
I eave me.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.500
- Arthur.
- Don't... just... you heard.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.130
Just

11:56.090 --> 12:00.174
Three more patrols have returned from
the white mountains, my lady.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.543
There is no sign of him.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.764
He must be somewhere.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.848
We have spoken to every villager,
every man, woman, child.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.058
Th... there has been no word.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.889
He is out there.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.858
We will keep searching.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.690
He is alive.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.104
I know it.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.106
I can feel it.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.407
Who else is still unaccounted for?

12:31.209 --> 12:32.244
(Saius.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.960
- He's not been seen?
- Not since the battle

12:53.648 --> 12:55.559
Any change? No.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.973
I et me see.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.898
Is that all you got?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.400
The hills are crawling with saxons.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.855
- There's no yarrow, no lady's mantle?
- I've got comfrey.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.740
You should've got sticklewort.
There must've been sticklewort.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.474
Merlin, why don't you water the horses?

13:11.666 --> 13:15.329
And make sure they're fed.
We can't hide here for much longer.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.091
He's a sorcerer.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.803
You knew. “Arthur.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.936
- He is your friend.
- I want him gone.

13:40.611 --> 13:44.900
- There is no need to fear him.
- Have him take word to Camelot _

13:45.074 --> 13:47.781
- To Guinevere.
- We cannot send Merlin. I will go.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.739
I need a physician right
now, not a sorcerer.

13:50.913 --> 13:54.622
He can do far more than me,
far more than you can ever imagine.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.162
Arthur.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.789
He doesn't just have magic.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.167
There are those who say...

14:02.342 --> 14:05.960
Ne's the greatest sorcerer
ever to walk the earth.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.056
- Merlin?
- If you are to stand any chance of survival...

14:12.226 --> 14:16.560
You will need Merlin
to help you, not me.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.481
(Gaius?

14:28.659 --> 14:32.072
There's a fragment of sword
embedded in his chest.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.077
Well, we'll use magic to draw it out.
No.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.956
The blade that struck Arthur
was no ordinary blade.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.663
I fear it was forged
in a dragon's breath.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.876
Its fatal power will not be easily denied.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.796
- Aithusa?
- The blade's point...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.835
Is traveling inexorably
towards his heart.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.843
Not even you could hope
to thwart such magic.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.846
It would take a power as ancient
as the dragons themselves.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.057
No, there must be something
that we can do, Gaius.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.646
Only the sidhe possess such magic.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.609
In the midst of the lake of avalon
there is an ancient isle.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.362
That is the source of their power.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.494
You must take him there.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.829
- He won't allow that.
- He will

15:21.587 --> 15:23.373
I spoke to him.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.097
The battle is not over, mordred.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.605
We will have our revenge.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.777
Arthur?

16:01.419 --> 16:03.705
We need to leave at first light.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.004
I'll decide.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.877
I can't let you die.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.513
It doesn't change anything.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.061
Let him sleep.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.473
It's late

16:31.324 --> 16:33.485
You cannot travel tonight.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.112
You were right to tell him.

17:00.186 --> 17:04.474
My lady, we have searched
every valley...

17:05.358 --> 17:07.440
Every gorge, every gully.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.401
- The king is nowhere to be found.
- I want him dead!

17:10.780 --> 17:12.611
We've looked!

17:18.621 --> 17:20.327
Find him.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.256
(Saius.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.845
(Give this to Guinevere.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.851
It's the royal seal, sire.
“If I am to die

17:48.025 --> 17:50.767
I can think of no one
who I would rather succeed me.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.654
Merlin:
You know he was betrayed.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.915
- The girl eira cannot be trusted.
- I know.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.790
How long does he have?

18:12.133 --> 18:15.045
At best, two days.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.178
Merlin

18:34.572 --> 18:37.780
I'll have your favorite meal
waiting for you.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.695
Now go. Look after him.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.331
(50.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.645
- Gaius.
- My lady.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.315
- Tell me.
- He's alive.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.030
Then why isn't he with you?

19:24.205 --> 19:25.991
He is wounded.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.622
He wanted me to give you this, my lady.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.584
- Where is he?
- There is a place where he may be saved.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.340
Merlin is taking him there
as we speak.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.130
Well, we must send the knights.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.424
- Ready as many men as you can.
- No, my lady.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.060
Merlin can cope by himself.
Merlin?

19:50.398 --> 19:53.356
- You must trust him.
- How can one man be as strong as an army?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.892
Morgana's forces are still
searching for Arthur.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.688
Two men traveling alone stand a much
better chance of evading her...

20:00.074 --> 20:02.941
Especially if she has no idea
where they're heading.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.466
Eira: Hey. What is it?

20:23.723 --> 20:26.009
- Tell me.
- Can't

20:27.768 --> 20:29.633
why not?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.561
Is it the king?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.138
What's happened to him?

20:35.818 --> 20:37.604
(Gwaine? Is he dead?

20:37.778 --> 20:41.191
- No.
- How do you know? Where is he?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.276
(Waine?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.692
Don't you trust me?

20:46.871 --> 20:48.827
I do.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.121
Then tell me.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.334
Merlin: Saxons.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.424
I'll deal with them

21:05.973 --> 21:07.088
keep your head down.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.131
Don't speak.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.985
Help us!

21:25.242 --> 21:27.949
Please, you have to help us...
We were ambushed.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.946
- By who?
- These two men.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.372
- What they look like”?
Merlin: Uh

21:34.627 --> 21:36.788
one was a... a knight.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.120
They stormed our camp.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.267
You're sure it was a Camelot knight?
Yeah

22:10.746 --> 22:12.702
You've lied to me all this time.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.208
Why don't you use magic?

22:29.223 --> 22:31.259
Habit, I suppose.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.519
It feels strange.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.563
Yeah

22:56.166 --> 22:57.372
I thought I knew you.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.295
I'm still the same person.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.675
I trusted you.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.888
I'm sorry.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.302
I'm sorry, too.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.561
What are you doing?

23:29.700 --> 23:31.611
They need drying.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.563
Gwaine: Eira.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.443
- I... I was just...
- Sending word to morgana?

24:12.201 --> 24:14.613
No. My lady...

24:15.079 --> 24:18.617
I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't betray you
or the king.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.144
And you didn't. You can go to your death
safe in that knowledge.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.229
Your note will send your mistress
riding for brineved...

24:23.253 --> 24:25.106
And all the while,
the king will be traveling...

24:25.130 --> 24:27.121
In the opposite direction. Guards!

24:27.675 --> 24:29.131
(Wainel

24:30.970 --> 24:34.508
Gwaine. Gwaine, please!

24:40.938 --> 24:43.099
Merlin:
This will be good for you.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.692
- You need to eat.
- Why are you doing this?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.897
Why are you...?

24:53.075 --> 24:54.736
Still behaving like a servant?

25:04.003 --> 25:06.039
It's my destiny...

25:07.923 --> 25:10.039
As it has been since the day we met.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.631
I tried to take your head off
with a mace.

25:14.805 --> 25:17.171
And I stopped you using magic.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.092
You cheated. Yeah.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.804
- You were going to kill me.
- I should have.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.185
I'm glad you didn't.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.315
I do this because of who you are.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.703
Without you, Camelot's nothing.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.163
There was a time when
that was true. Not now.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.919
There are many who can fill the crown.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.290
Never be another like you, Arthur.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.892
Oh, I also do this...

26:07.733 --> 26:10.349
Because you're my friend
and I don't want to lose you.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.790
You called for me, my lady?

26:28.003 --> 26:31.291
I want to thank you, Gaius.
“What for?

26:32.049 --> 26:34.210
Unmasking eira.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.758
I shall forever be in your debt...

26:37.221 --> 26:39.257
And Merlin's.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.848
- Was it he that found Arthur?
- He's a good servant.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.218
He's always been there at Arthur's side.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.679
Indeed.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.152
The sorcerer in the battle...

26:56.323 --> 26:57.688
You knew who he was.

27:00.661 --> 27:01.741
Yes

27:03.247 --> 27:05.078
do I know him?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.741
Please, Gaius, answer me honestly.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.042
Yes

27:18.428 --> 27:20.419
he'll take good care of Arthur.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.013
Yes, I'm sure he will.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.384
I'm pleased.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.281
You know what you said what you'd do...

28:31.460 --> 28:33.951
If you ever found morgana?

28:34.588 --> 28:38.126
Well, we've got a good idea
where she'll be heading.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.726
Arthur, you need to hold on...

28:56.401 --> 28:58.232
One more day.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.187
One more day.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.447
Why did you never tell me?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.458
I wanted to, but...

29:17.965 --> 29:19.421
What?

29:20.384 --> 29:22.466
You'd have chopped my head off.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.140
I'm not sure what I'd have done.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.726
And I didn't want
to put you in that position.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.355
That's what worried you?

29:48.829 --> 29:51.366
Some men are born to.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.492
Plow fields...

29:53.667 --> 29:57.501
Some live to be
great physicians, others...

29:58.672 --> 30:00.458
To be great kings.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.877
Me?

30:03.760 --> 30:06.217
I was born to serve you, Arthur.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.508
And I'm proud of that...

30:10.017 --> 30:11.757
And I wouldn't change a thing.

30:18.692 --> 30:19.727
Ready?

30:58.607 --> 31:01.098
Position lookouts
for the king's approach.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.662
Did you really think
you could outwit me?

32:09.970 --> 32:11.710
Arthur: Saxons?

32:19.020 --> 32:22.137
- They're long gone.
- How do you know?

32:22.983 --> 32:26.100
I can... see the path ahead.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.147
So you're not an idiot.
That was another lie.

32:33.743 --> 32:37.702
No, it's just
another part of my charm.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.213
Tell me where the king is.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.464
- I'd rather die.
- Then you shall have your wish...

32:57.642 --> 32:59.178
Once you've told me.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.094
Not even you, sir knight...

33:02.272 --> 33:04.604
Can resist the charms of the nathair.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.922
In there.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.485
Right.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.327
You've done this before.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.426
All these years, Merlin...

34:58.722 --> 35:01.008
You never once sought any credit.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.465
That's not why I do it.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.011
Come on.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.946
She's riding for avalon.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.660
(Swaine.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.621
I failed.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.501
No, you haven't.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.714
(Gwaine. Gwaine.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.768
Arthur!

35:52.817 --> 35:55.980
- I can't go on.
- There's not far to go.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.443
- We need to reach the lake before dawn.
- No, Merlin. No.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.574
All right.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.828
We rest for an hour.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.920
Merlin

36:27.227 --> 36:30.685
whatever happens...
Shh don't talk.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.934
I'm the king, Merlin.
You can't tell me what to do.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.562
I always have.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.111
I'm not going to change now.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.856
I don't want you to change.

36:45.412 --> 36:49.451
I want you to always...

36:50.333 --> 36:51.448
Be you.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.043
I'm sorry about how I treated you.

37:05.807 --> 37:10.096
Hey, does that mean...? Does that mean
you're gonna give me a day off?

37:11.479 --> 37:13.344
Two.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.055
That's generous.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.241
Get some sleep.

37:48.975 --> 37:52.638
Arthur, we need to get moving.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.641
Arthur.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.564
We've wasted enough time.

38:39.359 --> 38:42.271
Merlin: Avalon. We'll get there.

38:44.531 --> 38:46.237
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:46.407 --> 38:48.739
Whoa! Morgana: Hello, emrys.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.952
What a joy it is to see you, Arthur.

39:00.380 --> 39:04.794
Look at you... not so tall and mighty now.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.049
You may have won the battle,
but you've lost the war.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.758
You're going to die by mordred's hand.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.472
Oh, don't worry, dear brother,
I won't let you die alone.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.265
I will stay and watch over you...

39:22.735 --> 39:26.227
Until the wolves gorge
on your carcass and bathe in your blood.

39:26.406 --> 39:30.240
No the time for all this bloodshed is over.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.074
I blame myself
for what you've become...

39:35.540 --> 39:37.826
But this has to end.

39:38.001 --> 39:41.539
I'm a high priestess.
No mortal blade can kill me.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.334
This is no mortal blade.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.842
Like yours,
it was forged in a dragon's breath.

40:06.821 --> 40:07.981
Goodbye, morgana.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.242
All right.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.919
- Brought peace at last.
- Come on.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.050
Come on.

40:42.315 --> 40:45.273
We have to make it to the lake.
Merlin.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.935
Not without the horses.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.980
We can't. It's too late. It's too late.

40:53.409 --> 40:54.740
It's too

40:56.245 --> 40:59.954
all your magic, Merlin,
and you can't save my life.

41:00.124 --> 41:06.245
- I can. I'm not going to lose you.
- Just... just... just hold me.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.626
Please.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.626
There's... there's so...

41:15.014 --> 41:17.050
There's something I want to say.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.259
You're not going to say goodbye.
No.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.765
Merlin

41:26.150 --> 41:28.436
everything you've done...

41:30.071 --> 41:31.561
I know now.

41:33.950 --> 41:37.693
For me, for Camelot...

41:39.914 --> 41:43.748
For the kingdom you helped me build...
You'd have done it without me.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.285
Maybe.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.669
I want to say something I've never...

41:55.847 --> 41:58.088
Said to you before...

42:06.566 --> 42:08.227
Th... thank you.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.696
Arthur. Hey.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.499
No. Arthur.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.417
Arthur!

42:32.717 --> 42:34.548
Stay with me.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.589
Arthur.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.879
No

42:48.441 --> 42:51.148
Arthur! Aah!

43:16.552 --> 43:18.383
Merlin: Kilgharrah!

43:22.183 --> 43:25.050
I would not have summoned you
if there was any other choice.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.643
I have one last favor to ask.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.787
Kilgharrah: Merlin

43:55.550 --> 43:57.666
there is nothing you can do.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.337
- I've failed?
- No, young warlock...

44:02.515 --> 44:06.383
For all that you have dreamt
of building has come to pass.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.220
I can't lose him!

44:11.607 --> 44:16.397
- He's my friend!
- Though no man, no matter how great...

44:16.571 --> 44:18.983
Can know his destiny...

44:19.198 --> 44:23.658
Some lives have
been foretold, Merlin.

44:24.162 --> 44:27.370
Arthur is not just a king.

44:27.874 --> 44:30.331
He is the once and future king.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.875
Take heart

44:34.213 --> 44:36.955
for when albion's need is greatest...

44:38.885 --> 44:41.217
Arthur will rise again.

44:44.724 --> 44:48.637
It has been a privilege
to have known you, young warlock.

44:49.103 --> 44:52.812
The story we have been a part of...

44:53.482 --> 44:57.896
Will live long in the minds of men.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.599
Arthur.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.669
The king is dead.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.673
Long live the queen!

48:15.851 --> 48:19.764
All:
Long live the queen! Long live the queen!

48:20.439 --> 48:21.895
Long live the queen!

48:22.775 --> 48:26.267
Long live the queen!
Long live the queen!

48:27.488 --> 48:29.649
Long live the queen!

48:30.282 --> 48:34.241
Long live the queen!
Long live the queen!

49:07.987 --> 49:09.693
Narrator: Merlin
