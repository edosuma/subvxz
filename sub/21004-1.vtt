00:21.240 --> 00:22.700
Let's try it.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.929
- Ready for sound?
- Yeah. Always.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.605
There you go.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.980
- Give me that blue tape.
- You know the fucking mystery.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.650
All right.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.020
That's what it's about.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.249
- Yeah? Well, that's... That's... That's...
- Hey.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.686
That's right.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.580
I need some tea. Something for my throat.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.762
My throat sounds scratchy.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.540
Is that chair going to be
all right for your hip?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.900
- Yeah.
- Okay. We getting close here?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.525
- Almost.
- All right.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.890
Speed the spool up.
Videotape forward there.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.180
Okay, wait, wait. This one right here.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.020
Stop it. Stop it right there.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.820
- Agharta?
- That's it.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.060
Let me see.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.128
Osaka, Japan. 1975.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.444
- Funky.
- Yeah.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.126
Well... Well, cut the sound down.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.860
So, Miles, I know it's always
go forward, move ahead.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.740
And I don't want to just go down
that whole litany of things.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.491
The drugs, women, your muse.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.523
But if we can go back a bit, for context,

01:40.680 --> 01:43.411
and explore
your earlier stuff, modal jazz,

01:43.640 --> 01:46.420
- and its influence...
- I don't like that word, "jazz."

01:46.520 --> 01:48.980
Don't... Don't call it "jazz," man.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.620
- That's some made-up word.
- All right.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.580
Trying to box somebody in.
Don't call my music "jazz."

01:53.680 --> 01:54.860
All right.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.500
- It's social music.
- Okay.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.931
Social music. Perfect.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.644
Well, what made you stop
in the first place?

02:04.520 --> 02:07.100
I didn't have...
I didn't have nothing to say.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.362
I just didn't have nothing to say.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.891
Well, what were you doing all that time?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.965
A lot of shit,
it had nothing to do with music.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.404
Miles Davis, five years,
no playing at all. I mean, it's...

02:21.720 --> 02:24.087
How did you find your way back to it?

02:26.640 --> 02:28.802
You know. A lot of shit.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.220
A lot of shit goes through your mind
when you're quiet, you know.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.288
You have a lot of thoughts.

02:36.320 --> 02:41.201
And they can sometimes be fighting
each other. You know, like a war.

02:42.680 --> 02:47.447
And I'm a Gemini, so I'm...
I'm two people anyway, you know?

02:47.560 --> 02:50.006
I was born modal. This and that.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.602
Then someday you sit there
and something click.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.481
And that's it. You start playing.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.921
That's it.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.500
Are you getting...
Are you getting some of this?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.580
Guys, for fuck's sake, are we ready yet?

03:11.680 --> 03:12.700
I've been ready.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.180
Then why did nobody let me know,
for Christ's sake, if you're ready?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.281
All right. I'm ready.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.164
In three, two...

03:20.320 --> 03:24.860
In 1975, one of the most
prolific voices in music

03:24.960 --> 03:27.140
went silent for five years,

03:27.240 --> 03:30.642
- leaving the world to...
- Man, you ain't no Walter Cronkite.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.242
If you're going to tell a story,

03:35.360 --> 03:37.660
come with some attitude, man.
Don't, you know...

03:37.760 --> 03:40.161
Don't be all corny with this shit.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.286
All right, well, you are the artist, Miles.
How would you say it?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.007
Shit, that fucking tape. Fuck's sake!

04:10.160 --> 04:11.605
Lose this motherfucker!

04:11.840 --> 04:13.251
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:13.720 --> 04:15.131
Make a right! Go right!

04:19.040 --> 04:20.724
Shit! Is that him?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.365
Shit! Turn! Turn!

04:25.760 --> 04:27.808
Shit, it stalled! Get out! Go, go, go!

04:28.800 --> 04:30.060
Miles, get out!

04:30.160 --> 04:31.446
Jesus Christ, go!

04:33.000 --> 04:35.606
- My music!
- Don't go back for it! No! No!

04:36.720 --> 04:37.721
Miles!

05:06.200 --> 05:09.409
At precisely three minutes to 1:00,
Jack Johnson...

05:11.280 --> 05:13.726
Johnson is always the first to enter.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.940
So seriously does he take this ritual...

05:17.040 --> 05:20.328
Mr. Davis, if you could
just open the door for a moment.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.929
While outside, hundreds unable
to buy tickets await the outcome.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.660
Jeffries bears the reputation of being
the strongest man ever to enter the ring.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.762
The fuck you looking at?

05:40.480 --> 05:41.460
What?

05:41.560 --> 05:43.403
Don't play around with your life, junkie.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.660
I fronted you the coke.
Do you know what that means?

05:46.760 --> 05:48.728
Fuck you, Mack. Get in line.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.490
It's all on film for the world to see.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.447
High overhead, a desert sun scorches...

05:59.480 --> 06:02.450
The temperature is rising
and so are tempers.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.242
The bell rings for round 15.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.805
A vicious uppercut
and three stinging lefts!

06:10.520 --> 06:12.443
Jeffries goes down!

06:30.920 --> 06:34.300
Phil Schaap with you on WKCR-FM New York,

06:34.400 --> 06:36.380
the Miles Davis festival.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.900
That was the seminal So What
from Kind of Blue, 1959.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.220
That's one for the time capsule, folks.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.688
That's one they'll be talking about
in 1, 000 years.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.020
- The one you'll save from a burning building.
- This motherfucker.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.487
The culmination. The mountaintop.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.740
Over 100 records, and now silence.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.161
Five years is just too long.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.881
The world misses you, Miles.
Please, come back.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.900
WKCR-FM.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.900
Yeah, it's Miles Davis.
Put Phil Schaap on.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.540
- Really?
- Yeah, it's really me. Put him on.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.369
Yeah. Okay, okay. Sure.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.740
Really?

07:14.840 --> 07:18.420
My goodness, folks, I believe
we have the Miles Davis on the line.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.100
Mr. Davis, is this really you?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.260
- Yeah, it's me.
- What an honor.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.840
- I was just telling my listeners...
- Listen, Schaap. Listen.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.689
You talk too goddamn much, man.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.340
Time capsule?
Time capsule is for old shit.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.180
Dead shit, okay?
And I missed on Kind of Blue.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.620
Missed? But Mr. Davis,

07:35.720 --> 07:38.100
I think people would say
it's a masterpiece.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.660
How exactly did you miss?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.940
Hey, this ain't an interview, okay?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.540
Man, if you tape this, I'll kill you.
You got it?

07:44.640 --> 07:46.180
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.204
Yes, sir. I didn't mean
to upset you, Mr. Davis. I'm sorry if I...

07:49.320 --> 07:51.971
Nah. Nah. You know, forget it, man.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.220
Listen, play me some of that
Sketches of Spain.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.731
Solea.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.420
This one's for you, Mr. Davis.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.841
Solea from Sketches of Spain.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.566
Frances.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.567
Frances.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.841
Excuse me, man,
do you know if he's in or not?

09:57.440 --> 09:58.851
How should I know?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.847
Mr. Davis, just a moment of your time.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.281
I've been at your front door
for some time now.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.528
I feel sure you're in there.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.780
George Butler's office.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.564
- It's Miles.
- Yes, sir.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.620
- Hello, Miles.
- My check didn't come today, George.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.609
Where's my money? 20, 000?

10:25.720 --> 10:26.860
You trying to piss me off, man?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.361
Of course not,
but where is the session tape?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.284
We can't release more money until...

10:31.400 --> 10:34.563
- It's the same bullshit.
- Until Columbia gets that new music.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.300
20, 000 is chump change
compared to the business we're going to do.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.940
I know there's gold
on that session tape, man.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.180
Let's get you into fighting form again
and start working on that comeback.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.300
Hey, I didn't go nowhere, George.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.980
Now you want some music,
send me my fucking money.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.127
Fine...

10:58.560 --> 11:01.500
Mr. Davis, if you could just
open the door for a moment...

11:01.600 --> 11:03.060
- What?
- Mr. Davis,

11:03.160 --> 11:04.380
I'm sorry to take up your time.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.881
My name is Dave Braden,
Rolling Stone magazine.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.888
I'm here to do your comeback story.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.889
- Okay, move back a little bit...
- Yeah.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.729
Get off my motherfucking...

11:20.680 --> 11:22.205
Motherfucker!

11:22.520 --> 11:23.860
Hey, there's no need for that. Fuck!

11:23.960 --> 11:25.086
Open this fucking door!

11:26.360 --> 11:27.420
Motherfucker!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.761
- Hey!
- Hey, calm down, Mr. Davis!

11:31.200 --> 11:33.420
Hey, open this goddamn...

11:33.520 --> 11:35.660
You lost your fucking mind?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.524
Crazy motherfucker!

11:38.320 --> 11:39.606
I'm not playing with your ass!

11:40.600 --> 11:41.886
Hello?

11:44.440 --> 11:46.522
Open this door, God damn it!

11:48.200 --> 11:50.362
You better not be touching
nothing in there, motherfucker!

11:50.480 --> 11:52.164
Open the goddamn door!

11:52.840 --> 11:54.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.900
Inside the master's disheveled lair,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.860
rumor becomes reality.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.646
Jazz's Howard Hughes reviled and revealed.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.210
Open the fucking...

12:10.640 --> 12:12.369
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.380
All right, Mr. Davis,
I'm going to open the door,

12:15.480 --> 12:17.767
but I need you to calm down.
There's no need for violence like that.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.245
Open the door!

12:20.280 --> 12:22.220
- Mr. Davis. Please.
- Get the fuck out of my house!

12:22.320 --> 12:23.900
- Get the fuck out of my house!
- Just... Just relax!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.365
You going the wrong way, motherfucker!

12:25.480 --> 12:27.164
Listen, there's no need for that.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.100
I'm just here to speak to you.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.780
Shit! Shit!

12:30.880 --> 12:31.961
Columbia!

12:33.200 --> 12:35.282
Your record company set it up.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.731
- Columbia?
- Yeah, I'm just a writer, man.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.208
Can you drive, motherfucker?

12:48.560 --> 12:49.721
Prick.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.180
Open the door.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.681
- What?
- Open the door.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.820
- What's that?
- You mind?

13:09.920 --> 13:12.571
Man, take that fucking thing
off my dashboard.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.324
Irish motherfucker.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.006
Let's go.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.441
There... There he is! Miles!

13:26.400 --> 13:27.765
Miles!

13:42.840 --> 13:44.649
Look, I think we just
got off on the wrong foot.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.603
I just need a little background.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.660
I mean, I could write some bullshit
out of a magazine,

13:50.760 --> 13:53.570
but I'd rather hear it
in your own words, you know?

13:55.240 --> 13:56.980
Miles Davis' story. My words.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.445
That would be great.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.246
Go right.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.611
Okay. I was born.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.300
I moved to New York, met some cats,
made some music,

14:10.400 --> 14:12.060
did some dope, made some more music.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.083
Then you came to my house.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.205
That's it?

14:18.720 --> 14:20.500
Great. I guess I'll fill in
the blanks later.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.683
It's what all you writing motherfuckers
do anyway, right?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.486
Right turn.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.762
Wait, we're going to Columbia?

14:41.320 --> 14:42.970
Pull in right there.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.444
I'll just wait down here.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.962
Bring your ass out of my car!

14:58.640 --> 14:59.801
Shit.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.081
Miles?

15:03.360 --> 15:07.300
Don't send people to my house
to write some dumb fucking article.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.140
Write a check, George. I'll wait.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.368
Hold it a second, Miles.
I didn't send anybody to...

15:11.600 --> 15:13.060
- Here, take your boy back.
- Hey!

15:13.160 --> 15:15.300
- I didn't send anybody to your house, Miles.
- Okay, guys...

15:15.400 --> 15:18.404
You send this motherfucker to my house
to write some comeback story?

15:18.520 --> 15:20.124
I've never laid my eyes on him.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.485
Who are you?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.080
Dave Braden.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.420
Rolling Stone magazine.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.780
April, get me Jann Wenner
at Rolling Stone.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.006
Yes, sir.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.721
I'm not sure Jann himself
actually knows if I'm here.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.484
And why is that?

15:37.160 --> 15:39.460
There's a source at Columbia,
I won't say who,

15:39.560 --> 15:41.500
who told me about Miles' session

15:41.600 --> 15:43.620
and said you guys were
probably already long lead

15:43.720 --> 15:46.100
with the whole, you know,
comeback, promotional thing.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.380
Okay, you see this bullshit?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.641
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Miles...

15:48.760 --> 15:50.420
- Hey, can I say something here?
- You can get out!

15:50.520 --> 15:53.300
I do a session. Y'all already
got it going out all over the wire.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.620
That was almost a year ago.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.881
So what?

15:56.200 --> 15:59.329
Y'all can't wait to saddle me back up again.
The fucking comeback.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.460
How many records I cut for you?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.100
And I can't take some fucking time off?

16:03.200 --> 16:05.460
Of course you can. And you have.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.540
And now you have new material,
and we're all incredibly excited about it.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.980
That's right. My material.
My session tape.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.660
- And if I don't wanna give it to you...
- Guys.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.620
- Guys, can I get in here a sec?
- Ken.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.721
No, it's okay. I got it.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.244
Ken Schwinn, A&R.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.140
Now, Miles, as you know,
you're under contract here,

16:24.240 --> 16:25.526
and we paid for that session.

16:25.920 --> 16:30.100
So, we actually own that tape
and whatever music might be on it.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.124
Legally. And I don't mean this
as a threat, but...

16:33.560 --> 16:35.130
And, George, back me up here.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.321
Miles!

16:37.400 --> 16:39.243
Okay. Let's go.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.282
Now. You own my music?

16:45.160 --> 16:46.660
You must be a rich man.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.000
How much money you got on you?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.285
- What?
- On you. Right now. How much?

16:51.640 --> 16:53.165
400 or 500.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.204
You know how they say it in Missouri, son.
Show me.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.280
Okay. You about 19,000 light,
but that's a start.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.371
That's okay. Walter, Walter, be nice.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.484
Harper Hamilton.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.163
What an honor, sir.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.444
If I may, I'm a producer,
working with this kid.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.645
That's Junior.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.847
Scary.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.126
You have got to see it to believe it.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.802
He's playing a late set
at the Vanguard tomorrow night.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.122
I'd love it if you'd be my honored guest.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.205
Label mate.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.041
We're working out a deal here, too.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.643
Isn't that right, George?

17:42.960 --> 17:45.060
- Yeah.
- Now, you're a fight fan, right?

17:45.160 --> 17:47.900
I got a boxer on the card
at the cathedral tomorrow night.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.900
Maybe you'd like to check that out, too?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.367
We could talk a little shop.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.806
Shit.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.280
And I'm the asshole in the room, right?

18:19.280 --> 18:20.850
Miles, come on, man.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.690
You. Let's go.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.841
Is that Miles Davis?

18:30.440 --> 18:33.420
Wait a minute, Mr. Butler.
If I can get you that session tape,

18:33.520 --> 18:34.885
we can do a little business, right?

18:35.040 --> 18:37.520
- What?
- Don't say another word. Got it.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.680
- Stairs? Stairs!
- There. There.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.761
Man, what a waste.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.044
He's probably more profitable
dead than alive now, huh?

19:18.240 --> 19:21.926
Will you join me
in welcoming to the stage Miles Davis.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.200
Yeah!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.970
Sit down, girl. You're crazy.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.609
- Come on.
- You're drunk.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.361
Buddy, we fool around in this neighborhood,
we're going to get arrested.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.690
Gotta give this little bird
a thing for my friend.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.170
Won't take a minute.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.288
- Hey, Frances.
- Hey, Buddy.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.006
- This is for you.
- That's sweet.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.726
- How you doing? That's good.
- I'm good.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.602
So, you remember Phil, right?

21:01.680 --> 21:05.740
Hey, Ana, let me... Let me get a 20 spot.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.365
Sure, Miles.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.500
- Hey, you know Phil.
- Well, thank you, Buddy.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.726
Sure thing.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.771
See you later.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.767
Hi.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.885
I'm Miles Davis.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.364
I know. Frances Taylor.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.765
Look.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.323
This is my phone number.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.923
Well, now you don't have to stare.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.409
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.780
Hello?

22:10.880 --> 22:13.087
Miles, come watch me dance.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.410
How about a little dark meat
for Thanksgiving?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.127
Frances.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.290
What are you doing?

23:10.640 --> 23:11.721
Shit!

23:17.800 --> 23:21.009
Hey, it's cool. I got you, man. Hey.
Let me drive.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.371
Miles, Miles, look.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.620
I should have told you what was up
right off the bat.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.740
Miles.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.490
Miles. Hey!

23:29.800 --> 23:31.340
Look. Hey, listen.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.300
I understand where you're coming from
with those guys upstairs.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.660
It's never enough, right?

23:35.760 --> 23:38.411
They suck you dry and they fuck you over.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.460
Hey, listen.
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.260
Fuck the interview. Let's get right.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.647
I know what you need!
Let me get you right!

23:49.160 --> 23:50.844
I probably shouldn't shout this next part.

23:53.560 --> 23:57.380
I know this kid.
He gets it like... From the root.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.086
It's not stepped on,
and we can go right now.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.807
It's the best coke in the city.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.083
You is a crazy white motherfucker,
you know that?

24:17.800 --> 24:19.211
Yeah, I know.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.500
So, where's it at?

24:30.600 --> 24:32.125
Columbia.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.620
We just left Columbia, motherfucker.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.007
The other one, motherfucker.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.340
I did a story on this kid's old man.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.568
Big shot doctor,
he was into some crazy shit.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.403
The point is, this rich little fucker's
really got the goods.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.326
How much you holding?

25:07.440 --> 25:09.140
Whatever's in that clip.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.163
All right, just follow my lead.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.361
Man, this better not be no bullshit.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.841
Beat it.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.700
What the fuck...

25:19.800 --> 25:22.620
- No. No.
- Hey, Justin. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.100
Who the fuck are you to show up at my...

25:25.200 --> 25:27.180
You know what
"off the record" means, asshole?

25:27.280 --> 25:28.340
You knew what was up with that.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.460
You wanted to burn your old man, I helped.
So what?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.961
- So what?
- Man, get on with it.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.300
Yeah, come on in.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.051
- All right, let's do this quickly.
- Wait, come here a sec.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.731
What's going on?

25:44.880 --> 25:46.962
- Why is he with you?
- Mate, mate...

25:47.720 --> 25:51.122
- Right... Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.940
So, what can I do you for?

25:55.040 --> 25:56.860
- Make it an eighth.
- A quarter.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.803
Quarter? Yes, sir.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.300
A quarter? We've only got 500 bucks.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.289
That's your problem.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.645
You want to sit down, Mr. Davis?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.280
Yeah. Scoot over, girl.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.651
What an honor.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.923
You know who the fuck's sitting
next to you right now, Tami?

26:31.760 --> 26:33.540
His shit is mind-blowing.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.620
I mean, I've got the classics
right here, you know.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.681
And not just yours.
I've got the whole original experience.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.444
Blues. Gospel.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.210
Black music, it's where it's at.

26:47.720 --> 26:48.881
All right.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.140
No, no. It's 800.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.540
What?

26:54.640 --> 26:57.460
It would be 600 bucks
if I hadn't just walked in with him, right?

26:57.560 --> 26:58.860
You trying to hustle me, Justin?

26:58.960 --> 27:00.420
- No...
- Forget this kid, Miles.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.460
He's a crook.
You are a fucking crook, Justin.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.660
Fuck you.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.285
Look, this is the price, Mr. Davis.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.771
You've got to be kidding.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.460
What have you got?
What have you got of his here?

27:09.560 --> 27:14.380
What have you got? You've got, here,
Sketches of Spain, Birth of the Cool.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.900
How many times
have you got laid to this man's music?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.126
No offense, Tami.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.580
And now you're shystering him?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.728
I'm not shystering you, Mr. Davis.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.809
Which one does he play, Tami?

27:26.440 --> 27:28.090
I like that one a lot.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.180
Look. This is fine.
I'll give you an eighth.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.700
Oh, boy, you're still stupid.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.770
"Give him an eighth."
Go get me a fucking pen.

27:37.920 --> 27:38.967
Shit...

27:39.720 --> 27:41.085
Fuckin' A, man, you kidding me?

27:45.280 --> 27:46.441
Nah.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.820
Just do a couple for him, Miles.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.251
No, I don't do that.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.766
Right. Forget it.
That was stupid. Let's go.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look, look.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.885
Hold on.

28:03.320 --> 28:07.420
I'm sorry, okay?
Look, I'd go apeshit if you'd sign

28:07.520 --> 28:09.045
just a couple of these for me.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.607
You do that,
it'll cover what you're short.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.940
- For the quarter, right?
- Yeah, for the quarter.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.042
What do you think I'm saying, jerk?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.888
This is old shit.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.820
Man, I've cut like 15 records since these.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.651
Yeah, but this is the stuff people dig.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.640
This one's mine.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.764
And up.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.260
What's that move called?

29:09.360 --> 29:10.805
Attitude.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.366
Attitude. Really? Okay.

29:19.880 --> 29:22.645
And I'm up there, forever.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.041
Yeah.

29:25.880 --> 29:32.161
It's kind of... I mean, I feel like
I'm almost falling the whole time.

29:35.120 --> 29:40.206
And then that's when that...
That thing happens.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.340
Yeah. Right.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.044
Right.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.808
So, it's the same.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.740
It's the same?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.604
Yes, it is.

29:54.640 --> 29:58.645
You know what I mean?
When it's... When it's just right there.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.881
And you're holding them right there
in the palm of your hand.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.289
And you don't breathe.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.380
They don't breathe.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.484
And you're just...
You're just holding them.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.291
And then...

30:21.520 --> 30:22.851
We fly.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.651
Miles?

31:19.720 --> 31:21.848
Come here, silly.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.528
What's wrong with you?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.931
Asshole!

31:47.520 --> 31:48.646
Keys.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.340
Come on, Miles.
I just scored you fucking coke.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.808
Give me an hour. Give me half
an hour so I can do this right.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.580
I don't want to have to
write about all that other shit,

31:59.680 --> 32:01.500
the gun and the drugs and stuff.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.090
What's wrong with that?

32:04.800 --> 32:07.420
Nothing. I want to write about the music.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.260
Look, man, don't worry about none of that.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.300
Okay? Here's the type of shit
you're going to do for me.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.210
Fill the tank. Go get me catfish...

32:32.640 --> 32:34.005
Miles!

32:34.880 --> 32:36.180
Hey, baby!

32:36.280 --> 32:38.580
- Hey!
- What the fuck is going on, Janice?

32:38.680 --> 32:40.682
- It's Tuesday.
- So what?

32:40.920 --> 32:43.491
Don't you remember? You told me that
I could have a party here on Tuesday.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.722
I ain't talked to you in forever.
When I say that?

32:45.960 --> 32:48.440
You know, weeks ago.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.240
You always pulling this bullshit, Janice.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.020
How the fuck you get in anyway?

32:54.120 --> 32:56.566
Remember the key you hid
in your drawer that time?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.286
Move, motherfucker.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.681
Move!

33:03.400 --> 33:05.129
Miles Davis!

33:06.080 --> 33:08.300
Good to meet you again, my man.

33:08.400 --> 33:13.060
You know, you are so far out,
you just stopped making music,

33:13.160 --> 33:16.060
because you decide when you live and die.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.220
The artist is God.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.580
And when you're dead,
your funeral will be bigger than ever.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.460
- So far out...
- Here, let me help you with that.

33:23.560 --> 33:26.325
Kings and queens will come,
and they will be drunk

33:26.440 --> 33:27.820
and having sex in all the bathrooms...

33:27.920 --> 33:30.241
- Get the fuck off me, Hitler.
- Back up. Come on.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.169
- Just cool it. Cool it.
- Hitler? Outrageous!

33:32.280 --> 33:33.340
Get all these motherfuckers
out of my house!

33:33.440 --> 33:34.700
No, no, no. Miles, please.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.860
You promised me.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.247
I straightened up and everything.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.887
Look, I'll keep everybody away from you,
and we won't stay too late, okay?

33:42.560 --> 33:43.766
Please?

33:46.240 --> 33:47.220
Please.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.100
Keep your simple-ass friends
away from my equipment.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.806
- Of course.
- And just stay out the basement.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.286
Okay.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.644
Fucking Janice.
This shit is ridiculous, man.

34:10.679 --> 34:11.966
Come on.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.165
This place is...

34:18.320 --> 34:20.482
Do you do a lot of recording down here?

34:22.520 --> 34:24.500
Nice little hangout spot.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.090
Very cool.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.725
This is amazing.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.246
Fuck.

34:45.719 --> 34:49.770
- Told you, Harper.
- Yes, you did. Kudos to your sources.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.420
Yeah, I don't know about this, you know.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.330
You don't need to know. I know.
You just do your thing.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.380
So, what are we going to do?

35:01.480 --> 35:03.960
Are we just gonna walk up to him
in the middle of this party

35:04.080 --> 35:05.206
and just start playing?

35:05.440 --> 35:08.967
You know who John Coltrane was
before he was John Coltrane?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.260
A bar walker.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.140
He literally walked across the bar
playing his horn,

35:14.240 --> 35:16.300
people throwing nickels at him.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.607
Then, Miles hears him play...

35:21.560 --> 35:23.324
"John Coltrane."

35:24.000 --> 35:26.660
You think you're worse than a bar walker?
Trust me.

35:26.760 --> 35:30.810
We'll find a little corner,
you'll play and that'll be it.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.660
He just didn't look too much
like he wanted to...

35:33.760 --> 35:35.940
Junior, stop playing with your pussy,
all right.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.486
This is "take a shot" time. Let's go.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.045
Fuck you, Harper.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.400
Good?

35:47.360 --> 35:48.460
Not bad.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.688
Yeah, told you he had the good shit.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.700
Oh, my God, she's so beautiful.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.020
That look in her eyes, man.
I mean, that's something else.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.531
This is Frances, right?

36:01.760 --> 36:02.980
Here, have one.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.286
I... I'm good.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.404
Yeah. Yeah.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.961
Ta.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.241
Fucking hell. Fuck.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.561
Fuck.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.166
Fuck.

36:26.160 --> 36:27.380
You gonna be all right?

36:27.480 --> 36:29.926
Yeah, I'm going to need a drink
or something, or a Valium,

36:30.040 --> 36:32.247
or a quaalude, or maybe a brick.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.962
Get you a beer
out of that little fridge right there.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.180
No, I'm gonna need
something a bit stronger.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.980
I'll get something from upstairs,
if that's cool?

36:40.080 --> 36:41.366
Yeah. Go ahead.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.360
I'll need the key.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.740
Lock it behind you.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.340
It's the one with the little five on it.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.660
- Sure.
- Grab me some of that brown liquor.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.841
Yeah.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.363
Rolling Stone.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.610
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.690
How'd you weasel your way back in?

38:02.120 --> 38:04.691
I just waltzed in
with the rest of the riffraff.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.689
Lucky you.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.928
- Where's Miles?
- He left.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.580
Then what are you doing here?

38:15.680 --> 38:17.020
I'm just snooping around.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.327
I'm a writer. This is sort of what we do.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.006
Help yourself.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.724
Well, it's not yours,
what the fuck do you care?

38:26.120 --> 38:27.690
Easy. Easy now.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.700
Hey, guys, would you mind
if I asked you a few questions?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.140
Get the fuck out of here.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.890
"And he continues on his way."

38:36.720 --> 38:38.940
You know, this is what I'm talking about.
Kid, kid, hey.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.380
Don't let this be your future, okay?

38:41.480 --> 38:44.245
Bunch of degenerates partying in your house
when you ain't even home.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.180
Yeah, no, this is...

38:46.280 --> 38:47.406
Walter, go get the car.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.886
Okay, Harper.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.731
Hey. It's the tape.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.001
Well, well.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.443
Fucking Rolling Stone.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.740
What took you so long?

39:28.840 --> 39:31.081
Redhead. Hot pants. You know.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.860
Didn't know you could play piano.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.964
This ain't playing. Playing around, maybe.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.970
Sounds good to me.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.044
- You mind?
- Here.

39:49.840 --> 39:53.162
So, you studied piano, too?

39:54.240 --> 39:57.244
Nah. Just woke up black
and knew how to play.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.801
You're black?

40:00.480 --> 40:02.642
- Is it cool?
- Go ahead.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.849
Frances loves Chopin.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.207
Yeah, she looks like a classy chick.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.620
It's all we ever played
at the house, you know.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.006
Classical music.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.687
Chopin, Stravinsky.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.202
You know, we'd throw on some Ravel.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.284
I studied all them cats, man.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.688
Broke down their compositions.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.180
These revolutionaries. Innovators.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.011
Pushing back at that standard,
classical bag.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.691
Chopin, it's all about improvisation.

40:38.880 --> 40:43.602
This shit, Bird and Diz was doing that
on stage every night, on the fly.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.123
Didn't write it down.
Shit just came out of 'em.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.208
I wanted to quit every night.

40:54.040 --> 40:57.380
You know, old people,
they come up to me and they say,

40:57.480 --> 40:59.801
"Why don't you play like you used to?"

41:00.400 --> 41:02.084
I say, "Tell me how I used to."

41:03.560 --> 41:06.803
Takes a long time to be able

41:07.000 --> 41:08.604
to play like yourself.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.281
Man don't do nothing like he used to.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.649
The music don't move on,
then it's dead music, you know.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.366
It's just dead.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.940
Your turn, motherfucker.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.540
What?

41:26.640 --> 41:29.928
- You want the Dave Braden story.
- The Dave Braden story.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.971
All right.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.820
Was born in Scotland.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.571
Grew up, wrote some shit,
did some other stuff.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.603
And then I came to your house.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.568
You left something out.
Who touched you up?

41:44.200 --> 41:45.929
Are you going fucking senile?

41:46.720 --> 41:48.051
Before me.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.820
My wife's cocksucker boyfriend,

41:54.920 --> 41:57.180
flat-top, Neanderthal motherfucker

41:57.280 --> 42:01.126
decided it was his duty to
collect $22 of fucking alimony.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.366
Hey!

42:04.120 --> 42:06.420
- Give me that money!
- Okay, okay. Fuck!

42:06.520 --> 42:08.568
Okay, take the fucking money.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.802
Then I came to your house.

42:16.760 --> 42:17.921
Alimony.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.846
Yep.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.805
So, ex-wife.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.321
Yeah.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.121
Fucked your groove up a little bit?

42:29.080 --> 42:30.161
Yeah.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.246
Yeah.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.770
Man, come over here.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.811
Put these on.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.965
Throw a punch.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.808
At the bag, motherfucker.

42:52.480 --> 42:53.641
Right.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.483
Now throw a real one.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.900
Good. Now use your hip, okay?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.980
Power comes from the waist.

43:07.080 --> 43:10.540
That's it. Turn your waist.
Keep your foot on the ground, though.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.688
Snap it. Turn it over when you hit it.
Turn it over.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.370
Get back. Get back.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.411
Yeah. Yeah.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.362
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

43:20.760 --> 43:21.841
Look.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.483
Don't lock down chicks like that, man.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.043
Get you beat up for alimony.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.580
Wives is for important shit, man. Kids.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.205
Shit like that, okay?

43:32.640 --> 43:34.369
Come on. Hold it. Hold it.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.043
Get it. Get it back.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.740
Get it back. Let's go.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.047
Get it. Come on. Come on.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.328
Get it. One-two.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.060
Savoy Hotel, London.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.460
Yeah. Frances Taylor's room. 517.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.260
Yes, Mr. Davis. One moment.

43:58.360 --> 44:00.620
- Teo, we getting close?
- Yeah, we're getting close.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.690
Don't fucking get snappy with me, shit.
I'm the one waiting.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.089
I'm sorry. Mr. Davis,
there doesn't seem to be an answer.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.884
You motherfuckers know
how to leave a note under a damn door?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.809
That would be against hotel policy...

44:13.920 --> 44:15.001
Shit.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.126
All right, let's go, y'all.

44:53.760 --> 44:57.860
See it right there, G flat?
Yo, Gil, should this be G flat?

44:57.960 --> 45:00.042
All right, let's play it.
Let's do it again.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.007
Listen to each other.
Listen to each other.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.100
All right, now, see, you pick up
that note in the solo passage,

45:12.200 --> 45:13.700
- we could add that to it.
- Yeah.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.860
And then have them double it
when the section plays.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.180
You want me to make a note here?

45:18.280 --> 45:20.203
- Yeah, let's just try it.
- All right.

45:20.800 --> 45:24.220
We have fucking all this hard-ass music
play with Gil, shit.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.380
Got a Spanish record, too, I wanna do.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.130
Sketches of Spain.

45:28.400 --> 45:29.481
Good.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.051
That's a motherfucker.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.011
He was all up in there
like a motherfucker, man.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.800
Man, I was cleaner than a broke-dick dog.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.900
- Yeah, man, that suit was something else.
- Right?

45:50.000 --> 45:51.764
What's a broke-dick dog?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.820
That's in the forte scene.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.500
- Yeah. That's right.
- We're coming in to...

45:57.600 --> 45:59.700
That's right, and I want them to sting it.
You know, hit it.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.780
- Yeah.
- And really take it off.

46:00.880 --> 46:02.882
Then they gotta do a glissando.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.440
Yeah, man.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.260
- Y'all listening to them?
- Yeah.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.930
This is how this shit's supposed to sound.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.020
And hold that over to the next measure.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.167
Hold that over the measure.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.420
Yeah, then let it resolve.

46:19.520 --> 46:20.580
Let it groove.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.060
Yeah, let it groove.
We should get them back in.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.208
- Let's do it. Thanks, man.
- Let's get 'em back in.

46:24.520 --> 46:26.522
Teo, record this.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.920
All right, guys,
Gone rehearsal, take three.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.362
Y'all, let's be musical about this shit.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.740
Be wrong, strong, okay?

46:34.840 --> 46:36.180
Otherwise, lay the fuck out.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.044
Let's go, Gil. Count it off.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.448
One, two. One, two.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.140
Yeah?

47:22.240 --> 47:23.446
Hey.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.647
Hey.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.300
I've been calling you all day, Frances.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.340
I must have called you, like, 1,000 times.
Where you been?

47:31.440 --> 47:33.180
Miles, you know what time it is here?

47:33.280 --> 47:34.770
I just woke up.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.205
Guess what, baby.

47:38.640 --> 47:43.441
We're a royal hit! We got extended.
Three more weeks.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.167
I need you to come home, Frances.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.500
Honey, did you hear
what I just said? I can't.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.285
Just come home for one or two days.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.442
They can get by without you
for two or three damn days.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.801
Baby.

48:02.280 --> 48:03.805
It's because I didn't marry you?

48:04.960 --> 48:06.200
What?

48:06.320 --> 48:08.800
Listen, I've been thinking about it.

48:09.960 --> 48:13.487
Let's have a real serious talk about it
when you get home.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.100
I'm sorry, baby,
can you hang on for a sec?

48:17.200 --> 48:18.611
I'll be right back.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.481
Frances.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.241
Frances.

48:33.480 --> 48:34.561
Frances!

48:34.680 --> 48:35.886
I'm back.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.321
I'm going to send a plane
to pick you up tomorrow.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.806
I need you.

48:42.680 --> 48:44.011
I'll...

48:46.000 --> 48:48.606
I'll work it out with my understudy.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.127
Okay.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.850
I love you, baby.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.566
I know

48:57.320 --> 48:58.970
I love you, too.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.330
Ciao for now.

49:12.040 --> 49:14.088
Hey, y'all wake up.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.100
Someday, I'm gonna
call me up on the phone,

49:42.200 --> 49:45.249
so when I answer,
I can tell myself to shut up.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.320
Come on.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.007
Come on. Come play with us, man.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.361
Frances.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.644
I wasn't sure about these because I...

50:58.240 --> 50:59.660
What are you doing?

50:59.760 --> 51:01.285
Somebody stole my fucking tape!

51:01.880 --> 51:02.961
What?

51:06.400 --> 51:08.721
- What?
- You had my goddamn keys, Dave.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.770
I don't have your tape, Miles.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.890
- I spent all night downstairs with you.
- Then what the fuck happened?

51:14.720 --> 51:17.100
- Shit, those bastards.
- What?

51:17.200 --> 51:18.361
The...

51:18.480 --> 51:20.420
- What?
- That trumpet player, the kid,

51:20.520 --> 51:22.648
and that dodgy guy from Columbia,
they were here last night.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.860
- They was in my house last night?
- They were right here!

51:24.960 --> 51:26.020
The fuck you didn't tell me last night?

51:26.120 --> 51:27.929
I was off my fucking tits last night!

51:29.040 --> 51:30.060
Your tits... What?

51:30.160 --> 51:31.820
I was all messed up last night.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.365
With the coke and the booze and...

51:37.840 --> 51:39.968
All right, George,
you want to fuck with me?

51:40.520 --> 51:42.090
I'll fuck with you.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.609
Try releasing my shit.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.780
Sue the shit out of you motherfuckers,
I'll be on your fucking ass so fast!

51:48.880 --> 51:51.300
Columbia Records.
Due to the Yom Kippur holiday,

51:51.400 --> 51:52.561
- we will be closed today..
- Fucking Kippur!

51:53.520 --> 51:54.940
- Vanguard.
- What?

51:55.040 --> 51:57.805
That guy said the kid was playing
at the Vanguard tonight, right?

51:57.920 --> 51:59.285
Maybe we can catch him at rehearsals.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.321
Yeah. Come on.

52:04.840 --> 52:06.140
You want me to go up there?

52:06.240 --> 52:08.686
The fuck you think "come on" means?
Come on.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.209
What are you doing?

52:16.560 --> 52:19.404
You ain't driving me around
looking like that no more.

52:28.800 --> 52:31.201
Hey! Great to see you, Miles.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.140
What're you doing here?

52:33.240 --> 52:34.890
I'm not here.

53:14.560 --> 53:15.766
G flat!

53:32.560 --> 53:33.800
C minor!

53:45.480 --> 53:46.970
Right this way.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.609
There you are, Mrs. Davis.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.820
Excuse me, Miles. It's an honor.

55:30.920 --> 55:33.020
- Beautiful show.
- Thank you. Thank you.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.300
Miles, wonderful, son.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.402
- See you next week, John.
- Right.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.171
Hi, Miles.

55:38.720 --> 55:39.881
Hey...

55:41.040 --> 55:42.326
Emily?

55:42.440 --> 55:44.010
- Erica.
- Erica, yeah. Right.

55:44.840 --> 55:47.684
Would you walk me out
and help me get a cab?

55:47.880 --> 55:51.089
I don't feel it's safe for a girl
out there by herself.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.010
Yeah. Hold on a second.

55:59.440 --> 56:02.060
Hey, Bill, y'all play that bossa.

56:02.160 --> 56:03.491
All right, turn it up, guys.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.002
- Where to?
- I got it.

56:31.800 --> 56:34.087
Maybe you'd like to come by later.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.529
No. Good night, Erica.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.601
Hey!

56:50.920 --> 56:54.003
Hey! No loitering. Move on.

56:55.520 --> 56:57.488
I'm not loitering, man.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.410
I work in there.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.526
I don't care where you work. Move it.

57:03.560 --> 57:05.164
I'm Miles Davis.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.167
See? Miles Davis Quintet.

57:08.520 --> 57:10.010
That's me. That's my band.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.700
I don't give a shit.

57:11.800 --> 57:15.327
Move your ass off this corner now,
or I'll lock it up.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.820
I don't have to go nowhere, Jack.
It's public property.

57:18.920 --> 57:20.740
I can stand here
and have a smoke if I want to.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.365
Man, calm down. Hey!

57:22.680 --> 57:23.806
Hands up, boy!

57:26.560 --> 57:28.140
Did you see that, Frank?

57:28.240 --> 57:30.580
Yeah, he was going to
take a run at you, Bobby.

57:30.680 --> 57:31.940
- The fuck is wrong with y'all?
- You got this?

57:32.040 --> 57:32.980
I got it.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.940
- I ain't did shit!
- Stop moving!

57:35.040 --> 57:36.530
Okay, the car's here. Let's go.

57:37.520 --> 57:39.045
- Shit!
- Move it!

57:41.560 --> 57:43.210
Get in there, boy.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.086
Miles!

57:48.280 --> 57:50.328
That's my husband! Miles!

57:50.440 --> 57:52.761
That's my husband, move out of my way!

57:53.000 --> 57:54.331
Miles!

58:04.960 --> 58:07.201
You're a tough guy, ain't you?

58:08.080 --> 58:09.540
Yeah. I am.

58:09.640 --> 58:10.926
Fuck you.

58:13.080 --> 58:14.320
Shut up!

58:40.800 --> 58:42.643
Frances.

58:52.120 --> 58:54.460
That's Miles Davis there. Do you hear me?

58:54.560 --> 58:56.130
Miles Davis!

58:56.840 --> 59:00.260
These cops think they can just do
whatever they want to do to anybody.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.820
Dumb cracker motherfuckers,
I'll tell you right now.

59:01.920 --> 59:03.780
- This will not be the end of this.
- That's enough out of you!

59:03.880 --> 59:05.020
That's enough out of me, or what?

59:05.120 --> 59:07.540
What's gonna happen?
You gonna beat me, too?

59:07.640 --> 59:10.962
We're gonna sue the shit out of
all y'all racist sons of bitches.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.447
My husband does not belong in here.

59:16.360 --> 59:17.691
What about me, man?

59:19.440 --> 59:20.646
Knock it off.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.540
God, baby, look at you.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.100
- It's okay. It's okay.
- What did they do?

59:26.200 --> 59:27.260
What they do to you?

59:27.360 --> 59:29.124
It's okay. It's okay.

59:30.360 --> 59:32.283
Listen, let's get out of here.

59:42.520 --> 59:43.965
That's good?

59:48.480 --> 59:50.642
I want you to quit dancing, Frances.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.525
What?

59:54.600 --> 59:56.967
I want you to quit dancing.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.761
- You want me to quit West Side?
- No.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.371
Quit dancing altogether.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.609
You're my wife now.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.648
Your place is with me.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.605
I know.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.363
I know it's a sacrifice.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.780
A sacrifice?

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.420
I'll take care of you
for the rest of your life.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.921
You don't have to worry about nothing.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.801
Frances.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.580
- Boy, that tune was cruising!
- Dude, we gotta change key.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.330
We gotta change the key.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.321
Dave!

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.660
- Here, go get him!
- No, no...

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.380
- I don't need a gun.
- Go get him, man. Go get him!

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.811
Stay! Stay!

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.445
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.
Hey, take it easy, kid.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.380
So what, man. You gonna shoot me
over some fucking tape?

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.766
What? No. Where is the fucking...

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.361
Are you kidding me?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.121
Okay.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.321
Fuck!

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.121
Hey.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.340
Drop it.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.046
Okay, okay. Be cool. Be cool, baby.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.130
Dumb motherfucker!

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.020
Where the fuck is my music?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.060
I got it, all right?

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.482
But let me... I was just trying
to help, Mr. Davis. I swear...

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.085
Don't lie to me, hype.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.500
You'll steal anything for some dope.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.980
No, no... Harper was just trying to...

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.660
Wait, wait a minute.
Let me explain something to you, Mr. Davis.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.820
That man right here's a crook!

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.180
So says the thief?

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.180
Thief? You was trying
to take his tape, man!

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.328
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.620
What did Harper give you to steal my tape?

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.060
- Answer me!
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.380
Just maybe a chance
to get to work with you.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.380
To help you come back.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.686
Yeah.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.840
'Cause you just the hype
with the heart of gold now?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.580
Yeah.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.523
You remember that move, right?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.850
Man, bring your ass.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.164
Stop playing E flat
over D minor 9, rookie.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.531
Right here.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.360
- Junior?
- Hold on, baby.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.325
It's not there.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.450
- What?
- I gave it to them.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.767
- Gave it to who?
- Who do you think?

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.220
You gave them the goddamn tape?

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.460
Well, what did you want me to do?
Did you want me to fight them?

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.289
That wasn't your tape to give to nobody.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.561
Was it yours, Junior?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.650
What are you doing, man?

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.004
Irene. Irene, I'm sorry.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.170
Harper got it, man.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.370
Where is Harper?

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.340
I don't know. At his studio or something.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.090
You call him right now.
Tell him you're coming over.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.980
I can't take y'all over there, man.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.700
- He'll kill me.
- You don't do what I say,

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.201
I'm gonna kill you. Now call him!

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.130
- Call him!
- All right. I'll take y'all over there.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.647
But I gotta do something first.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.220
- Hello.
- Harper.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.940
Junior.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.168
You sent Walter to my house?

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.140
You didn't deliver the tape
last night, Junior.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.220
So, I guess you're out.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I blew it, man. I know.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.860
Okay? Just let me come by,
talk man to man.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.980
I'm going to the fights, Junior.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.731
I know Just give me about an hour.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.811
All right?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.086
One hour.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.980
Hey, what you doing, man?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.801
Hey, this ain't
"fly away like a bird" time.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.164
We got work to do.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.804
That's all you get.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.847
Man, I can't watch this shit.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.620
This is way too complicated, okay?

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.260
Just tell everyone to meet at Diahann's,

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.420
- and I'll teach one big class over there.
- Tonight?

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.100
No, I don't know when.
Just figure it out and let me know.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.850
I can't have... Figure out...

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.260
Frances? Hello? Franny, you there?

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.900
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Okay.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.490
- Okay.
- I'm still not clear...

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.760
Let's work out on
Wayne's tune we was working on.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.561
Is Miles here?
Who is this? I said who is this?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.768
Miles! How did you get this number?

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.660
Hey, what's going on, Frances?

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.780
- Hey, Miles. This is...
- Don't talk to him, bitch!

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.020
- Hang up the phone!
- I'm talking to you!

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.620
- You understand me?
- I just called to say hi.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.340
Hang up the damn phone. Get off the...

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.771
You talking to me?

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.660
Nefertiti.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.620
Y'all play Nefertiti. I'll be back.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.404
Go on. Play it. Play it.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.500
Miles is a married man,
do you understand me?

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.620
And you ain't nothing but a whore!

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.820
- Now, you listen to me, bitch.
- How dare you talk to me like that?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.020
Don't you ever call this house again.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.140
I'm telling you right now...

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.340
What are you doing?

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.180
What am I doing?

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.220
What the hell do you mean,
"What am I doing?"

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.900
I told you, don't worry about that.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.420
This is my house, Miles! My house!

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.180
Don't you have them calling
my fucking house!

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.860
I didn't tell nobody
to call the fucking house.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.460
This is too much, Miles.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.609
- This is too much!
- Just stay off the damn phone. Shit!

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.980
Don't you walk away from me.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.366
Frances.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.448
I make your life beautiful, Miles.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.930
I take care of you, I feed you.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.805
Lie down in that fucking bed next to you.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.580
You are my husband! You are with me!

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.580
I gave up everything for you, Miles.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.569
I stopped dancing for you!

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.380
And you know what?
You have never played better

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.500
a day in your life, and you know it.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.170
I'm the prize here!

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.044
I deserve better than this!

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.850
Are you through?

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.011
You mother...

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.328
Everything okay, Miles?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.729
- Yeah?
- Junior.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.122
He's going down, man. Knockout.
Third round.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.286
Walter, you are dumb,
but at least you're pretty.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.561
Don't do it!

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.045
Easy. Easy.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.605
Where's my tape, Harper?

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.926
Right there, my friend.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.568
- Go get his gun.
- Why do I have to get his gun?

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.920
Go get it!

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.091
Sit your ass down.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.245
Sit down!

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.886
Watch him.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.088
Yeah, no. This is... This is great.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.160
Junkie and the flunky.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.690
Fucking Larry and Moe.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.611
I love those guys.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.281
So, I guess you're not
getting it either, huh, Rolling Stone?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.289
You and this kid's story,
lumping me in with that shit.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.847
What?

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.406
It's pathetic.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.380
No, yeah. You go ahead. Take that tape.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.820
I just did, motherfucker.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.161
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me, you know?

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.203
I know. I can count.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.088
Right. I almost forgot,
you used to be a musician.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.051
Go Ahead John
from the Jack Johnson sessions.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.540
Miles Davis radio.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.926
George put you all up to this?

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.811
I'm an enterprising young man.
I got options.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.130
Where the fuck are you going?

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.090
See you around, Miles.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.880
Junior.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.406
This little fuck-up.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.605
They made me do it, man.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.767
Well, we're not going to let a bag of money
just walk out the door, Walter.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.001
Go bring me back that goddamned tape.

01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.260
I knew your ass was dirty!

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.340
Gimme my keys!

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.700
You're not saying you believe
that bullshit back there, are you?

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.881
Keys!

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.940
Fuck, all right.
But let me tell you one thing.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.380
I never wanted your tape,
I just wanted the story.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.420
- I was trying to help.
- That's three fucking things.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.170
Now give me my goddamn keys!

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.649
Miles, we should go.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.646
Miles!

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.171
We should go!

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.240
Miles. Let me talk to you for a second.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.327
Shit!

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.806
Fucking get in!

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.280
Go! Go!

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.326
Make a right! Go right!

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.481
Is he there?

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.561
Fuck, Miles!

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.820
Shit! Give me that other gun.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.380
I don't have it.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.811
- What?
- I chucked it.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.300
The fuck! Why?

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.209
I didn't know we were going
to get in a gunfight, did I?

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.731
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.170
Shit! Lose this motherfucker!

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.721
Miles!

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.200
Frances.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.486
I think we've lost him.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.723
Keep going, keep going.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.445
Don't stop.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.220
- Here he comes!
- Is that him? Shit!

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.481
Turn! Turn!

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.680
Shit, it stalled! Get out! Go, go, go!

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.121
Go.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.644
Jesus, go!

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.280
Don't go back for it! No! No!

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.761
Miles!

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.166
Leave it!

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.329
Fuck! Get in there.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.165
Come on! He's coming!

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.327
Miles!

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.846
Fucking hell!

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:37.527
Fuck!

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.650
Okay, we gotta get out of here.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.684
We gotta get out of here,
take you to the hospital.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.260
What are you doing?

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.601
You've been shot. I should drive.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.241
Fuck.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.601
Wait a minute, where are you going?

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.820
Hey, man, just make some more shit up.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.729
You're Miles fucking Davis.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.248
I'm getting my goddamned music back.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.491
Found you.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.480
Fuck.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.484
Come on. Come on.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.563
This is nuts, man.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.241
All right, listen, Miles, that's it.
You're on your own.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.820
This is madness.
I am not dying over this tape

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.660
'cause that's what's going to happen
when you go in there.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.081
You get it? They will kill you.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.611
You hear me?

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.860
Yeah.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.200
Miles.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.220
I'm sorry. Mr. Davis.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.140
With this type
of degenerative hip disorder,

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.210
surgery and pain medications
are your only recourse.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.240
Frances.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.580
Frances!

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.980
Stop it, he's going to hear us.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.241
I like that.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.050
Oh, boy! That's Miles Davis!

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.369
Hey, hold it, buddy, hold it, buddy.
You see that line?

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.644
You're... Yeah. You're Miles Davis.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.564
I'm sorry, Mr. Davis.
Do you have a ticket?

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.924
You're looking at it.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.206
Come on!

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.405
That's Miles Davis!

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.660
Where is he?

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.125
Where is who?

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.540
Don't fucking lie to me, I heard him!

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.780
- What are you talking about?
- Where is he?

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.620
- I don't know who you're talking...
- Come here!

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.881
Miles, wait!

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.660
Miles. Miles, wait!

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.364
Miles, there's nobody else. I'm yours!

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.460
What... Oh, my God!

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.927
Miles, you're hurting my arm.
Please, stop.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.420
Miles, listen to what I'm saying.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.940
Miles, there's nobody here!

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.180
Stop for a second, this is crazy!

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.140
Miles, what are you looking for?

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.401
Stop!

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.980
Listen to me, it's those pills.
They're making you crazy...

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.570
Oh, my God!

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.540
- Listen to me...
- Where is he?

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.980
Miles! Oh, my God, Miles.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.180
Where is he?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.180
He's over there. He's over there, Miles.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.460
He went down there. He's down there.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.721
Kill his ass...

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.605
I can't believe this shit.
Look at this motherfucker here, man.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.440
Relax, he's not going to do anything here.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.860
Wait, wait!
No, no, no, Miles, you go. Please.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.931
I'm too scared. He said he would kill me
if I didn't leave you, Miles.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.700
Okay. You go wait upstairs.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.768
You wait upstairs for me.
I'll kill his ass.

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.006
Okay.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.483
You don't know what the word
"lose" means, do you, Miles?

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.561
Miles!

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.405
Back up!

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.849
Jesus, come on, Miles!

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.965
Get my shit! Get my shit!

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.324
Got it, got it, got it!
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.280
Come on.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.801
Frances!

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.086
Keys!

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.780
- Holy fucking shit!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.380
Just keep going, all right?
Just keep going.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.244
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.660
Hey, Miles, we're gonna
get you fixed, all right?

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.171
We'll get you fixed up, man, don't worry.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.725
Just take me home.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.380
Hello?

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.801
You thought I wouldn't find you?

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.411
You make me come out there,
the only thing left is gonna be bullets.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.211
You hear me?

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.129
I'm not coming back.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.801
I... I'll kill myself, Frances.
I swear to God.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.803
Please, Frances. I...

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.883
Frances, I love you.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.780
I know you do.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.484
Goodbye, Miles.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.700
I'll grab a towel or something.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.325
Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.645
These fucking drawers are full of...

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.209
Miles, where do you keep your towels?

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.841
Miles?

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.331
Got it, got it.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.842
Take it from C. Letter C.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.485
When do you come in?

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.491
I'm in there.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.285
- I don't hear any trumpet in it.
- I played organ.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.446
The whole time?

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.086
Shit.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:22.124
Look here, man, maybe you,
you know, go back to scales and, you know,

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.569
get your chops back, right?

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.528
Here, this is what you want, right?

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.771
Bye-bye.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.962
Have a nice trip, junkie.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.001
Take this fucking fraud with you.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.965
Come on, you're fucking kidding, right?

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.131
Is that it?

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.042
I see. So, you're gonna
just get back in the hole now?

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.260
You're going to do more of this.
Isn't this where I came in?

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.940
You in here doing
all this fucking what? Doing...

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.849
- Nothing.
- Fuck you, Dave.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.168
You ungrateful motherfucker.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.180
Well, fuck you, man.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.620
I'm not going down there.
I'm not getting in the fucking hole.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.300
Because I've got work to do,
I'm going to write the fucking story.

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.460
- Is that right?
- I'm going to write the fucking story.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.403
The dirt. The truth about you.

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.500
And if Rolling Stone don't want it,
well, so what?

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.126
You know how many people
will pay for what I've got?

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.683
You may be a quitter,
but you're still a fucking earner, baby.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.540
Yeah.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.620
Come on, you're Miles Davis.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.291
Change it up, isn't that what you say?
Don't repeat yourself.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.849
You've fucking done this before,
the self-pity and burnout motherfucking part.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.885
What was that?

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.566
It's that.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.010
That ain't in there.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.246
Yeah. Yes. Yes, it is.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.331
Let me show you.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.489
You start with the...

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.649
Start with the three...

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.483
Start with the three,

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.980
and then go to the tonic,

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.731
and then a flat six, and then B major.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.130
Wait a minute, play that again.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.486
Now this time don't play the F sharp.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.050
Play... Play F minor seven

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.808
in that second chord. Play it.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.900
Okay. So... So, like this?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.650
With the seven.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.927
- That's it. Yep.
- Yep?

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:18.051
Play it again.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.900
- See that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.766
Okay, that's it. Now put it...
Voice it like this, though.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.020
You know what I'm saying?

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.420
- See that with the D?
- But what's that going to do?

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.740
- It opens it up. Makes it a little cooler.
- Okay.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.888
You can go anywhere with that.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.580
If you're going to tell a story,
come with some attitude, man.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.127
Don't, you know..
Don't be all corny with this shit.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.491
Well, how would you say it, Miles?

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.364
Yeah. That's how I'd say it.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.780
Your playing,
it really takes you on a journey.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.660
Yeah, that's music.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.569
You know, something clicked.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.844
Is there any way that you could put that,
what you just played, into words?

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.890
You just did, man.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.045
I gotta go.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.300
I've got work to do.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.607
Actually, Miles, I've many more...

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.250
Where's this guy...

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.925
Hey, Miles!

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.324
Are you coming back?

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.003
You better believe it.
