Christmas traditions.

01:25.384 --> 01:27.055
Candy canes!

01:27.120 --> 01:28.689
Presents!

01:28.754 --> 01:31.659
New inventions to make the season bright!

01:31.724 --> 01:34.162
Little thing l've been working on.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.032
Yes, we have all of the usual traditions!

01:37.097 --> 01:38.365
Gingerbread houses,

01:38.431 --> 01:39.699
wreathes,

01:39.765 --> 01:41.034
caroling,

01:41.101 --> 01:42.369
stockings.

01:42.435 --> 01:48.180
Oh, but the Royal Christmas Tree
is much more than a tradition.

01:48.241 --> 01:52.282
You see, every ornament on our tree
is a memory,

01:52.812 --> 01:56.853
a memory of a kindness
or of a thoughtful deed.

01:56.915 --> 02:01.692
lndeed, the ornaments
represent centuries of goodness,

02:02.622 --> 02:07.498
a timeless record of the best we've done
throughout the years,

02:07.560 --> 02:10.699
gratefully hung upon our tree.

02:10.895 --> 02:12.633
And so it goes.

02:12.698 --> 02:18.509
This Christmas, new ornaments
will honor new deeds of kindness.

02:18.571 --> 02:22.712
And each unique creation holds within it

02:22.775 --> 02:27.084
the very spirit of Christmas.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.818
Oh, nice tradition, you say?

02:29.882 --> 02:31.852
Nay, my friend,

02:31.917 --> 02:37.061
for us,
the Royal Christmas Tree is Christmas.

02:51.437 --> 02:55.845
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

02:55.908 --> 03:00.284
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

03:00.946 --> 03:03.318
Come on, Jean-Bob. Sing along!

03:04.184 --> 03:07.089

03:14.293 --> 03:18.135
Oh, sure, 'cause ze rest of ze year
you're busy as a beaver

03:18.198 --> 03:19.266

03:19.365 --> 03:23.339
Well, someone woke up
on the wrong side of the lily pad.

03:23.402 --> 03:25.707
Spring is ze season of love!

03:26.139 --> 03:27.975
Ze chances of me getting ze kiss

03:28.041 --> 03:32.115

at Christmas are almost zip!

03:33.079 --> 03:36.318
Down from the usual one in a million.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.383
Come on, fellas!

03:37.650 --> 03:39.420
Can't hear you back there!

03:39.952 --> 03:43.759
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

03:44.990 --> 03:47.428
Number 9!

03:47.493 --> 03:49.763
A little warning Rothbart, please!

03:49.828 --> 03:53.469
Are you sure Derek and Odette are coming?

03:53.533 --> 03:55.603
Unfortunately, yes!

03:55.668 --> 03:58.240
Same plan as always then,

03:58.304 --> 04:00.341
iust get his attention,

04:00.406 --> 04:05.516
and soon, Derek will follow you
right into my trap.

04:05.578 --> 04:11.056
Then l'll have my revenge on him
for doing away with me.

04:11.751 --> 04:16.427
So, when he shows up, don't move.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.993
Easy for you to say, Ghost Man!

04:19.059 --> 04:20.494
You're already dead!

04:20.560 --> 04:25.169
l've only got one life left,
and trouble always seems to...

04:26.632 --> 04:28.836
...come my way!

04:28.901 --> 04:31.306
Eyes on the prize, Number 9.

04:31.371 --> 04:38.084
Remember, once l get my body back,
l'm giving you an extra life.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.985
Don't move.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.922
lf you say so.

04:48.021 --> 04:52.028
...to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

04:52.558 --> 04:55.964
Christmas has the best holiday music,
don't you think?

04:56.029 --> 04:59.201
-Much better than Pumpkin Awareness Day.
-Pumpkin!

04:59.265 --> 05:01.202
Do l have that on the list?

05:02.068 --> 05:04.038
lt's gotta be on there somewhere.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.673
Oh, here it is.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.908
l have to make pumpkin pie for the widows.

05:07.973 --> 05:08.974
Whoa!

05:14.013 --> 05:18.622
Ya know, l've been seeing this cat a lot lately,
except without all the ice.

05:18.684 --> 05:20.687
Shoo, little fella, shoo.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.489
Go on.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.696
That was kind of creepy.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.867
On the other hand,
he did stop us in the right spot.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.569
Mistletoe?

05:35.635 --> 05:37.505
l don't know how it is in your kingdom,

05:37.570 --> 05:41.010
but our tradition says...

05:41.074 --> 05:43.745
l know all about that tradition.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.649
Merry Christmas, Derek.

05:49.815 --> 05:54.157
How come no one ever told me
about zis mistletoe business before?

05:58.191 --> 06:01.964
Zis changes everything! Everybody sing!

06:02.028 --> 06:06.569
Over ze river and through ze woods
To Uberta's house we go

06:06.632 --> 06:12.510

And poof! l'm a frog no mo-oh

06:18.144 --> 06:21.350
Cookie.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.949
l can't!

06:23.016 --> 06:27.391
Uberta told me to blow the horn
the very moment l see Derek's sleigh,

06:27.453 --> 06:29.857
or else...

06:33.326 --> 06:35.697
You've used up all my pucker!

06:35.761 --> 06:39.101
l can't blow the horn if l've lost my pucker!

06:39.165 --> 06:40.700
Silly puppy!

06:40.766 --> 06:43.004
Smoochie give you extra pucker!

06:43.203 --> 06:44.805
No, it...

06:44.904 --> 06:46.007
He's coming.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.414
Wow. Listen to that!

06:52.478 --> 06:54.315
Give that guy a promotion.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.199
They're playing our song.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.638
Yeah, those have to be
one of Lord Rogers' inventions.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.173
And iust look at the swans!

07:18.238 --> 07:19.540
Now, that's all Mom.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.475
Every year she chooses a Christmas theme.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.380
And this year it's
''A Swan Princess Christmas.''

07:24.444 --> 07:25.646
Wow.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.149
l'm really impressed with your mother.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.017
Yeah.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.620
There's something
you should know about Mom.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.722
There's actually two Ubertas.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.225
The regular Uberta, the one you know...

07:37.290 --> 07:40.663
Derek and Odette!

07:40.726 --> 07:44.700
Your first Christmas together!

07:45.098 --> 07:47.902
...and then there's Christmas Uberta.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.507
Okay folks, let's move it!
We've got a lot of work to do!

07:52.038 --> 07:54.642
She's very focused.

07:54.707 --> 07:55.708
Derek!

07:55.775 --> 07:57.879
The tree! Move!

07:59.612 --> 08:01.549
Odette, you're with me!

08:03.116 --> 08:06.355
l mean this way, darling!

08:08.554 --> 08:10.090
And Chamberlain!

08:11.057 --> 08:12.058
Yes, madam.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.462
Let all the staff know,

08:14.527 --> 08:18.568
it's time to bring up the ornaments
for Ornament Day!

08:20.966 --> 08:22.502
l iust love it!

08:23.202 --> 08:25.774
Wow, Rogers. Love the chimes.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.843
Oh, had a little spare time.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.679
You again?

08:40.318 --> 08:45.496
And now if you'll excuse me,
Operation Smoochfest is underway.

08:45.558 --> 08:49.432
You remember
the last Operation Smoochfest?

08:49.495 --> 08:53.336
Oh, yeah. Operation Smushfest.

09:04.610 --> 09:08.818
-Okay, l'm headed down to the cellar.
-Good.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.987
Now, the thing you're looking for is...

09:12.552 --> 09:14.622
There's people down here.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.059
So what? They don't care about you.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.596
Oh, really? l'm a black cat!

09:20.660 --> 09:21.962
So?

09:22.028 --> 09:25.934
l lost four of my eight lives
just by crossing people's paths!

09:25.998 --> 09:27.634
Get down there.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.579
You get to carry the Royal Star!

09:38.678 --> 09:40.848
l shall carry it with pride.

09:41.614 --> 09:45.521
Yes, but with both hands, please.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.586
Oh, sorry.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.659
-All boxes checky-check!
-Good, good, good.

09:50.989 --> 09:52.927
When Derek returns with the tree,

09:52.991 --> 09:57.134
we'll be ready for Ornament Day.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.467
That mean you call kingdom to castle.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.635
Yes.

10:02.768 --> 10:06.008
Someone need pucker practice!

10:09.008 --> 10:10.778
Are you moving or not?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.247
Well, kisses don't last forever.

10:15.981 --> 10:17.984
At least l hope not.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.192
Get me out of here!

10:25.225 --> 10:27.729
Thanks for breaking that up, chief. Yuck.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.564
Now. Move it!

10:30.429 --> 10:33.068
Against the back wall to the right!

10:33.432 --> 10:34.535
You're lucky.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.005
Most cats don't know right from left.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.474
-Found it!
-Excellent.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.910
Now, get Derek.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.846
That's the best part! We don't need him.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.713
The lock's got a key!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.183
No! Don't open it!

10:49.249 --> 10:51.319
lt can't be you.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.857
Derek's the one who sent me out of this life.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.527
He's the only one who can let me back in.

10:58.591 --> 11:02.598
lf it's anyone else, that's it for both of us.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.767
Oh, so it's back to Plan A then, huh?

11:05.931 --> 11:09.872
Get Derek's attention, lead him
to the cellar, yadda, yadda, yadda.

11:10.436 --> 11:15.579
lt's gonna be the worst Christmas present
he ever opened.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.847
There.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.319
Oh, the orphans are going to love it!

11:24.384 --> 11:26.988
l sure hope
that's on your Christmas list, Princess.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.025
Shouldn't you be
cutting down a tree or something?

11:30.089 --> 11:31.358
Yes, he should!

11:31.424 --> 11:32.425
You're late!

11:32.892 --> 11:33.994
-Now mush.
-Right.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.399
Odette. Follow.

11:37.463 --> 11:41.671
Oh, sorry. That was Christmas Uberta.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.710
Last year we found
the Royal Christmas Tree here,

11:48.774 --> 11:52.882
but this year, l think this is the spot.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.949
lce Leopard Pass?

11:55.614 --> 11:57.552
Too dangerous?

11:57.917 --> 12:01.024
Oh, no, not dangerous enough!

12:01.087 --> 12:03.024
l was going to suggest Grizzly Falls,

12:03.089 --> 12:07.931
but if you'd feel safer in Ice Leopard Pass,
then all right.

12:08.527 --> 12:11.300
Remember, it's all about more lives.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.734
No!

12:23.976 --> 12:24.977
What's this?

12:25.044 --> 12:26.781
lce Leopard Pass.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.382
We might see a cat.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.830
lt's Christmas.

12:44.897 --> 12:47.435
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

12:47.500 --> 12:49.670
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

12:49.735 --> 12:52.373
'Tis the season to be jolly

12:52.438 --> 12:54.642
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

12:54.707 --> 12:59.550
Don we now our gay apparel
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

12:59.612 --> 13:05.323
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

13:06.652 --> 13:09.491
Wow! Really amazing!

13:09.555 --> 13:13.229
Just wait until you see
Lord Rogers' little group.

13:21.967 --> 13:26.042
Hark, the herald angels sing

13:26.105 --> 13:30.047
Glory to the newborn King

13:30.143 --> 13:34.251
Peace on earth, and mercy mild

13:34.314 --> 13:38.555
God and sinners reconciled

13:38.617 --> 13:42.892
Joyful, all ye nations rise

13:42.955 --> 13:46.562
Join the triumph of the skies

13:46.625 --> 13:50.533
Hark, the herald angels sing

13:50.596 --> 13:54.804
Glory to the newborn King

14:01.374 --> 14:04.113
And now, here's why l wanted you to see it.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.616
You, see, it's all part
of a Christmas Eve celebration!

14:07.680 --> 14:09.517
-Yes. And...
-And we were thinking...

14:09.582 --> 14:12.621
Let the Queen speak, please.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.887
That we would like you, Odette...

14:13.986 --> 14:18.161
Hello! Real crown here! Not a toy!

14:18.891 --> 14:19.926
Yeah. Sorry.

14:19.992 --> 14:23.566
We'd like you, Odette, to arrange,
rehearse and choreograph...

14:23.629 --> 14:26.034
Your very own number for Christmas Eve!

14:26.099 --> 14:28.002
Rogers!

14:28.134 --> 14:31.707
-My very own number?
-Oh, dear

14:31.770 --> 14:34.643
she's so grateful she can't speak.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.444
You can thank us later, dear.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.981
Thank you,

14:43.682 --> 14:45.353
l think.

14:49.622 --> 14:53.763
The Royal Tree is down there somewhere,
Brom. Time to strap on the skis.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.565
lt's time for me to get...

14:58.498 --> 15:01.737
Don't worry,
l'll keep a look out for predators.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.238
Brom?

15:05.204 --> 15:08.177
Oh, l don't care if predators see me.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.945
And you have every reason to feel that way.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.416
What's that thing?

15:16.949 --> 15:19.521
Snowboard. Rogers' latest invention.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.588
lt's faster. Better.

15:21.820 --> 15:25.695
Well, old-fashioned skis
are fast enough for me.

15:31.597 --> 15:35.204
l'm glad to hear that.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.804
lce leopard?

15:42.375 --> 15:46.116
Okay, okay, eat the round one, please.
l need the other guy.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.950
Move out, Brom. l've got your back.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.351
But keep an eye out.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.487
They hunt in pairs.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.056
Pairs!

16:04.363 --> 16:06.301
Unbelievable.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.651
Goodbye, life!

16:27.620 --> 16:30.158
Hello, life! Signing off!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.796
Signing on!

16:35.894 --> 16:36.896
Still good.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.014
l don't wanna miss Christmas dinner!

16:53.946 --> 16:56.151
Nice and safe.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.856
Where's the brakes?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.493
Oh, no.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.530
Derek!

17:24.643 --> 17:25.645
Mommy!

17:43.362 --> 17:48.339
Oh, yeah, he's a born killer.

17:49.335 --> 17:52.140
Okay, iust settle down!

17:52.205 --> 17:57.515
Yeah, he took down two ice leopards,
while he was moving!

17:57.577 --> 18:00.816
Look, look, l'll give ya three new lives! four!

18:00.879 --> 18:03.085
Now way! l'm out!

18:03.149 --> 18:04.618
Wait! Wait!

18:04.683 --> 18:07.723
five new lives then! Six!

18:07.787 --> 18:11.995
Okay, nine new lives,

18:12.525 --> 18:16.532
if you get Derek to open the chest.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.136
From one to nine in one little leap.

18:22.901 --> 18:25.607
Mistletoe properly positioned.

18:25.671 --> 18:29.378
Breath neutralized.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.647
Target located.

18:33.712 --> 18:37.020
Are you sure this is a good idea, Jean-Bob?

18:37.483 --> 18:40.155
She has lips. l have ze mistletoe.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.490
What could go wrong?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.093
He should wait for answers.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.010
Fellas, l am iust swamped.

19:01.074 --> 19:04.213
Can you help me come up with a number
for the Christmas Eve party?

19:04.277 --> 19:08.852
Well, as soon as our very little friend
comes to his very little senses.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.550
Oh, dear.

19:15.621 --> 19:20.063
Don't know how it is with your people,
but our tradition says...

19:23.696 --> 19:25.299
You're good.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.368
l get lots of practice.

19:27.533 --> 19:32.743
Evidently, some people have no respect
for Christmas traditions!

19:33.206 --> 19:35.376
Evidently, you're a frog.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.279
Zat's not why l can't get smooches!

19:38.344 --> 19:41.216
Christmas is ze reason!

19:41.381 --> 19:45.188
Jean-Bob, that's it! Christmas is the Reason.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.655
l love that song!

19:47.720 --> 19:50.492
And l love you, Jean-Bob.

19:51.557 --> 19:57.168
Zis one loves me. Zat one wants to kill me.
Ze world is a very confusing place.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.574
Oh, it's a beauty, isn't it, Rogers?

20:05.638 --> 20:08.343
Can't you haul that thing any faster?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.745
Oops. Sorry.

20:12.578 --> 20:17.321
Now, Uberta,
instead of lighting the tree with candles,

20:17.383 --> 20:22.192
this year please consider
my newest invention.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.690
What is it?

20:23.756 --> 20:27.063
l call it the light bulb.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.198
lt'll never catch on.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.767
Get the candles ready. Chop, chop!

20:35.268 --> 20:40.011
May l request a second opinion
from regular Uberta?

20:40.073 --> 20:43.446
Oh, all right! Just get cracking.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.322
lt's Ornament Day!

20:55.488 --> 20:56.990
lt's Ornament Day.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.895
lt's Ornament Day!

21:12.038 --> 21:13.774
Have you seen Prince Derek?

21:13.839 --> 21:15.108
Probably working on his ornament!

21:15.308 --> 21:16.677
lt is Ornament Day.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.645
Ornament Day?

21:20.346 --> 21:22.683
Bells ring!

21:23.183 --> 21:25.654
Hearts sing!

21:26.119 --> 21:32.097
Come see what love brings!

21:33.592 --> 21:38.536
Pictures tell a story
of two hearts full of love

21:38.597 --> 21:43.941
They're sharing a memory
of caring and tender rejoicing

21:44.004 --> 21:49.647
lt's the season of love
that comes at Christmastime!

21:49.709 --> 21:51.546
We live it

21:51.610 --> 21:53.181
Love it

21:53.246 --> 21:55.049
Beg it to come

21:55.114 --> 21:57.752
-And want it to stay
-And want it to stay

21:57.817 --> 22:01.457
To have this season each day

22:01.521 --> 22:06.397
lt's the season of love

22:07.793 --> 22:12.402
Lulu's lost her luster
Will you help make her shine?

22:12.798 --> 22:18.276
Ajewel in this spot
and your coin in your pocket for Christmas!

22:18.338 --> 22:24.216
lt's the kind acts of love
that make a Christmas shine

22:24.277 --> 22:25.779
We're lighter

22:25.845 --> 22:27.148
Brighter

22:27.247 --> 22:29.284
Wiser by far

22:29.349 --> 22:32.154
Because we follow that star

22:32.218 --> 22:35.657
Because we find who we are

22:35.721 --> 22:39.528
ln the season of love

22:41.494 --> 22:44.032
Bells are rung

22:44.097 --> 22:46.501
Carols sung

22:46.566 --> 22:47.968
lt's begun

22:48.601 --> 22:52.342
Our glad Christmas-tide

22:52.405 --> 22:58.183
But when l give a gift from my heart

22:58.244 --> 23:03.454
Then Christmas has finally arrived

23:04.417 --> 23:09.960
There's a magic that takes
the fear out of living

23:10.056 --> 23:13.462
When you have it
there's peace in your heart

23:14.627 --> 23:16.664
That's what it does

23:17.130 --> 23:21.438
There's a magic that's found
when you're giving

23:21.500 --> 23:25.408
And it's here
in the season of love

23:27.307 --> 23:32.884
There's a magic
that takes the fear out of living

23:32.945 --> 23:37.020
When you have it
there's peace in your heart

23:37.450 --> 23:39.921
That's what it does

23:39.985 --> 23:44.294
There's a magic that's found
when you're giving

23:44.357 --> 23:48.665
And it's here
in the season of love

23:52.231 --> 23:56.907
My friends, Lord Rogers
will light the tree on Christmas Eve

23:56.969 --> 23:59.174
with his newest invention,

23:59.238 --> 24:02.144
-the light ball!
-Bulb!

24:03.943 --> 24:07.450
And now, to conclude Ornament Day,

24:07.513 --> 24:10.685
we will place the Royal Star!

24:18.624 --> 24:19.625
lt's gone!

24:20.693 --> 24:23.131
But it was in the box, l saw it!

24:23.296 --> 24:25.600
-You checky-check, right?
-Me checky-check!

24:25.665 --> 24:27.101
See! She checky-check!

24:27.167 --> 24:28.769
You checky-check me checky-check!

24:28.834 --> 24:32.208
Hey, hey, it's okay. We'll find it. l'll iust go

24:32.271 --> 24:32.271
checky-check one more time.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.157
Oh, you've got something to do with this,
you creepy little cat.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.060
At least he doesn't have his bow...

24:52.125 --> 24:55.130
Wait! Now he's going to kill me
with his bare hands!

24:57.763 --> 24:58.764
Not so fast!

24:59.465 --> 25:01.368
He's on my flattened tail!

25:06.206 --> 25:08.743
Oh, great. A matching set.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.919
Yeah, open it.

25:27.060 --> 25:29.330
How did... That's weird.

25:40.139 --> 25:44.781
On the first day of Christmas
Prince Derek gave to me

25:44.843 --> 25:48.518
A way back to earth

25:50.616 --> 25:52.686
You're still a ghost?

25:53.419 --> 25:55.189
Not for long.

25:55.255 --> 25:58.260
l'm gonna so mess with people.

25:58.491 --> 25:59.626
Check this out.

26:09.535 --> 26:10.803
Wait, wait...

26:10.869 --> 26:12.240
Wait.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.208
So, when do l get my nine lives?

26:14.274 --> 26:15.843
Once a year? Lump sum?

26:16.509 --> 26:21.619
Hey, l gotta get my own body back
before you get any new lives.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.987
What? That's false advertising!
You never said...

26:25.051 --> 26:27.321
You never asked me, Fuzzy.

26:27.386 --> 26:33.031
Besides, l couldn't do it now,
even if l had the ol' bag o' bones.

26:33.093 --> 26:35.497
-What?
-The only thing more powerful

26:35.561 --> 26:39.869
than the Forbidden Arts
is the spirit at Christmas.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.705
At Christmas, l ain't got much iuice.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.440
Would l lie?

26:48.441 --> 26:51.246
All right, whatever.

26:51.311 --> 26:55.852
So this is when you decide to come back?
When you're at your weakest?

26:56.316 --> 27:00.123
Well, you have to come back at Christmas

27:00.186 --> 27:03.458
if you want to destroy Christmas.

27:03.523 --> 27:05.526
Destroy Christmas?

27:05.591 --> 27:08.163
You can't even give me extra lives!

27:08.494 --> 27:10.030
True.

27:11.264 --> 27:16.207
But l can cast one itty bitty spell at a time.

27:16.302 --> 27:20.843
lf l play it right, Christmas will fall,

27:20.906 --> 27:24.113
along with Derek and Odette.

27:26.546 --> 27:27.547
Dang.

27:27.647 --> 27:32.189
Crushing this would have put
a really nice button on that speech.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.224
But, of course, Odette!

27:37.290 --> 27:40.362
How can you possibly do a Christmas song
without singers?

27:40.426 --> 27:41.761
lndeed!

27:41.827 --> 27:46.403
You can borrow as many
of my sopranos and altos as you like.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.738
And l'm happy to lend you
my tenors and basses.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.672
That's very unselfish of you.

27:51.737 --> 27:54.943
Oh, dear, it's no trouble at all.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.176
Not in the least.

27:56.409 --> 28:00.483
ln fact, Rogers, l'd like to borrow
a few baritones myself.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.184
Of course you can...

28:03.249 --> 28:04.517
-Not.
-What?

28:05.451 --> 28:09.325
l know what you're up to,
you baritone-napper!

28:09.955 --> 28:12.627
And who's had their eyes on my altos?

28:12.692 --> 28:14.295
Me!

28:14.360 --> 28:19.636
My eyes, but not my ears
because they sound like alley cats!

28:19.699 --> 28:21.002
Now, wait.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.903
You're iealous!

28:22.968 --> 28:24.271
You're iealous-er!

28:24.337 --> 28:28.078
How could l be iealous
of such sad silly ninnies!

28:28.141 --> 28:32.015
We'll see who sounds like sad ninnies,
silly Sally!

28:32.078 --> 28:33.079
Please!

28:33.146 --> 28:36.051
Let the competition begin!

28:36.116 --> 28:38.987
You're going down, Hairdo!

28:39.052 --> 28:41.356
Bring it on, Pipe Cleaner!

28:48.228 --> 28:50.498
You stay two steps behind me.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.965
Don't count on it!

28:52.031 --> 28:53.667
Get back! Get... Get back!

28:53.733 --> 28:56.038
Move your bouncing bustle out of my way!

28:56.102 --> 28:57.404
Stop pulling on my dress!

28:58.104 --> 28:59.706
Did that iust happen?

29:00.039 --> 29:00.039
Oh, believe it, sister.

29:42.682 --> 29:45.254
Someone hasn't been showing
much Christmas spirit.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.925
Hey, Number 9, it worked!

29:50.589 --> 29:53.963
Man, is it great to be back.

29:56.895 --> 29:58.366
Oh, great!

30:04.504 --> 30:05.606
Rothbart!

30:18.084 --> 30:21.023
l'll iust be on my way.

30:46.346 --> 30:49.919
He's back. And l let him in.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.786
That cat led me here.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.855
How did l not see this?

30:55.188 --> 30:56.523
Master Hunter!

31:01.794 --> 31:04.032
l might not be able to see you now.

31:04.330 --> 31:10.375
But l will hunt you down,
and send you back where you belong.

31:15.008 --> 31:16.210
Are you sure?

31:16.276 --> 31:19.015
l heard him. l saw him.

31:19.345 --> 31:23.453
The chimes made him visible,
they seemed to hold him.

31:24.417 --> 31:28.091
Yes. Because they represent Christmas.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.756
And you.

31:29.822 --> 31:31.392
But what does he want?

31:31.457 --> 31:33.594
l think l know!

31:33.659 --> 31:37.566
Your mother and Rogers are suddenly
fighting about the Christmas Eve party!

31:37.630 --> 31:38.631
Yes.

31:39.232 --> 31:41.469
He said, ''lt worked.''

31:41.534 --> 31:44.773
He's using the Forbidden Arts
to destroy the Christmas spirit!

31:44.837 --> 31:47.742
-We've got to tell them.
-No.

31:47.807 --> 31:50.746
lt won't do any good
while they're under the spell.

31:50.810 --> 31:53.916
This has to stay between us for now.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.352
Okay, Derek's onto us.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.122
So, a little brainstorming session!

32:00.420 --> 32:03.793
Spells that will destroy the Christmas spirit!

32:03.856 --> 32:07.296
Right. Before Derek can catch you or me.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.630
You're lucky, most cats can't write.

32:09.695 --> 32:15.006
Okay! There are no bad ideas
so just let it flow.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.336
Great, great! How's this? How's this?

32:16.402 --> 32:18.339
The little chef guy,

32:18.438 --> 32:23.181
make him make bad decisions
with all his little Christmas creations!

32:26.212 --> 32:27.747
You call that an idea?

32:28.948 --> 32:32.055
Okay, how about this spell?

32:32.118 --> 32:35.858
Christmas cheer drives the frog berserk!

32:36.722 --> 32:39.027
l got better ideas in my elbow.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.393
How about this?

32:40.460 --> 32:41.461
Christmas gifts.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.900
Odette, she's got incredibly bad taste!

32:44.964 --> 32:46.534
For the next parade!

32:48.601 --> 32:50.838
l can't cast a spell on Derek or Odette.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.207
They got too much Christmas spirit.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.708
Come on, Number 9!

32:54.773 --> 32:57.713
You said there were no bad ideas!

32:57.776 --> 32:59.413
There ain't!

32:59.479 --> 33:03.220
But there sure are a lot of lousy ones.

33:07.253 --> 33:08.254
Where you going?

33:08.321 --> 33:11.160
Brainstorming is for dumbbells.

33:11.224 --> 33:14.563
l'm better shooting from the hip anyhow.

33:21.334 --> 33:22.502
Derek!

33:22.568 --> 33:24.939
Find me another way in!

33:54.434 --> 33:57.873
lt's a chime convention out there!

33:58.171 --> 34:00.275
Clever boy, Derek.

34:00.339 --> 34:05.216
But the castle ain't the only place
l can destroy Christmas.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.652
Enioy it while you can.

34:21.393 --> 34:26.237
Jolly old St. Nicholas
Lean your ear this way

34:27.467 --> 34:32.009
Don't you tell a single soul
what l'm going to say

34:32.072 --> 34:33.808
What l'm going to say

34:33.873 --> 34:36.745
Oh, dear, that's too cute.

34:36.809 --> 34:38.746
You bet it is, Beanpole!

34:38.811 --> 34:41.949
l obiect! We've never used animals before.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.150
Sue me.

34:43.216 --> 34:46.221
Tell me if you can

34:46.284 --> 34:49.058
Merry Christmas.

34:49.722 --> 34:51.926
Yes!

34:53.226 --> 34:56.364
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yay!

35:01.101 --> 35:02.837
Zis is ridiculous!

35:02.902 --> 35:07.344
Lord Rogers said
we're essential in upping the cute factor.

35:07.473 --> 35:10.278
l hate being used for my good looks.

35:10.343 --> 35:12.146
What's in it for me?

35:15.981 --> 35:18.353
Time to get my angel on.

35:23.456 --> 35:24.457
Hit it!

35:28.461 --> 35:31.967
Angels we have heard on high

35:32.032 --> 35:36.240
Sweetly singing o'er the plains

35:36.302 --> 35:42.147
And the mountains in reply
Echoing theirjoyous strains

35:42.208 --> 35:43.209
Oops!

35:44.210 --> 35:48.451
-Gloria
-Gloria

35:49.248 --> 35:51.019
Two animals!

35:52.118 --> 35:58.530
ln excelsis Deo

35:58.591 --> 35:59.592
Angels

36:00.259 --> 36:01.595
Well done!

36:03.196 --> 36:06.135
You're going down, sister!

36:12.238 --> 36:13.807
Wait, wait, stop!

36:13.872 --> 36:16.812
Down! Stop!

36:20.279 --> 36:23.953
Oh, cruel universe!

36:24.817 --> 36:27.355
You may think you've trumped me, Rogers,

36:27.420 --> 36:29.657
but there's one thing you forgot.

36:29.722 --> 36:31.392
l know where to get

36:31.457 --> 36:32.492
a zebra.

36:34.527 --> 36:36.530
And l'm not afraid to use it!

36:36.596 --> 36:39.401
Your zebra is no match for my

36:39.599 --> 36:41.069
flamingos!

36:41.234 --> 36:43.638
Flamingos, eh?

36:43.703 --> 36:45.907
l'd be scared if l didn't have

36:46.506 --> 36:48.243
a Shetland pony!

36:48.841 --> 36:49.842
You wouldn't!

36:50.343 --> 36:54.217
Oh, l'm that crazy! Believe me!

37:02.022 --> 37:04.025
l didn't want to have to do this.

37:04.090 --> 37:05.091
Rogers, careful.

37:05.158 --> 37:06.860
But you leave me no choice!

37:06.925 --> 37:08.462
Think of future generations!

37:08.761 --> 37:10.631
-l'm bringing in...
-No.

37:14.767 --> 37:18.708
-...baby pandas!
-No!

37:23.809 --> 37:29.020
You want the children
to sing for the Christmas Eve party?

37:29.115 --> 37:30.116
l do.

37:30.383 --> 37:34.591
But first, l'll have to set up a little audition,
ifthat's okay.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.392
Well, okay, then.

37:38.758 --> 37:39.926
Wonderful.

37:39.992 --> 37:43.399
Now, l knowiust the song
l want you to learn.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.932
lt goes something like this.

37:48.068 --> 37:51.607
Christmas is the reason for the season...

37:51.671 --> 37:54.343
...when Jesus Christ was born

37:55.641 --> 37:58.113
Oh, they know that one real well.

37:58.578 --> 38:01.150
Then what do you say
we take a ride to the castle

38:01.214 --> 38:03.184
in the Royal Sleigh?

38:06.752 --> 38:09.257
-Merry Christmas.
-And to you, sir.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.957
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

38:13.326 --> 38:17.033
-Give my best to your dear wife.
-Don't worry, l'll carry it.

38:17.597 --> 38:22.306
Bleh! Good thing l'm a ghost,
or l'd be puking!

38:22.668 --> 38:25.340
What a fine goose!

38:28.308 --> 38:31.180
For that price it better lay golden eggs.

38:33.613 --> 38:39.091
God rest you merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

38:40.320 --> 38:41.321
Hold on.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.257
-Hold it.
-What's this?

38:43.323 --> 38:45.060
You try singing next to Marvin.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.028
He's flat as a pancake!

38:47.093 --> 38:49.030
Well, better than being sharp as a stick!

38:49.095 --> 38:51.899
Then l'd poke you in the ribs
to get you on pitch.

38:51.964 --> 38:53.067
Oh, leave him alone, would you?

38:53.399 --> 38:56.338
Now, that's music, boys.

39:01.174 --> 39:02.209
Wish me luck.

39:02.541 --> 39:05.915
lf it goes well,
remember it was my suggestion.

39:05.978 --> 39:08.717
lf it goes bad, it was his idea.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.220
l hope you like it.

39:12.551 --> 39:16.493
lf you have any suggestions, please.

39:18.457 --> 39:25.371
Christmas is the reason for the season
when Jesus Christ was born

39:25.665 --> 39:28.604
Christmas is a reason for love on earth

39:28.967 --> 39:32.742
Oh, bless that happy morn

39:32.805 --> 39:38.850
Peace and love, goodwill toward men
In praise we sing this day

39:38.911 --> 39:44.789
His blessed birth in Bethlehem
The life, the truth, the way

39:45.751 --> 39:49.792
Christmas is the reason
for the season when...

39:58.664 --> 40:00.234
Holy brown out.

40:03.102 --> 40:04.405
Don't look at me!

40:04.804 --> 40:07.309
Derek and Odette!

40:07.873 --> 40:09.576
The chimes!

40:12.378 --> 40:15.183
So unsatisfying!

40:15.681 --> 40:18.653
His blessed birth in Bethlehem

40:18.784 --> 40:21.890
The light, the truth, the way

40:27.160 --> 40:31.268
These children should definitely be
the Christmas Eve grand finale,

40:31.331 --> 40:33.301
don't you agree, Rogers?

40:34.133 --> 40:38.475
Without question! The only thing cuter
than the animals are these

40:38.537 --> 40:39.573
children!

40:39.839 --> 40:40.941
Yes.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.945
And they're all mine.

40:45.345 --> 40:46.513
And no one else's.

40:46.846 --> 40:50.220
You would take all ofthem?
You slithering serpent!

40:51.917 --> 40:53.820
Back away, Pencil Neck!

40:54.020 --> 40:57.659
Fork over Freckles and Pigtails,
and no one gets hurt.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.460
What's gotten into you two?

41:00.026 --> 41:02.797
Odette's right! You can't iust cast us aside!

41:08.601 --> 41:13.744
Back online! Whew, Momma! That was close!

41:13.806 --> 41:16.378
We got to figure out how they did this.

41:16.575 --> 41:19.515
-And by ''we,'' you mean...
-You.

41:19.979 --> 41:20.980
Yeah.

41:21.514 --> 41:24.319
Sorry, allergic to chimes.

41:24.417 --> 41:28.792
l'm allergic to death.
But l'm going, l'm going.

41:29.155 --> 41:31.726
-Good kitty.
-More like dumb kitty.

41:33.493 --> 41:37.567
l thought for sure
l had broken Rothbart's spell.

41:37.630 --> 41:41.604
One moment the orphans had Rogers
and Uberta clapping and singing.

41:41.867 --> 41:47.378
And the next, it was like separating
two baboons fighting over the same banana.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.777
At least it's iust Mother and Rogers.

41:49.842 --> 41:51.245
Everyone else seems to have a lot of

41:51.710 --> 41:53.514
Christmas spirit.

41:55.448 --> 41:56.817
Where is everyone?

41:57.216 --> 41:58.586
Hello!

41:59.618 --> 42:01.422
Hang on, Sir Peter! l'm coming!

42:02.255 --> 42:03.657
l got ya.

42:04.424 --> 42:05.425
Thank you, Prince Derek.

42:06.292 --> 42:07.394
Are you all right?

42:07.493 --> 42:11.000
Fine. More than l can say for her.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.967
My wife made that angel.

42:14.067 --> 42:15.836
We'll have it fixed right away.

42:16.169 --> 42:18.806
l can do it, Princess.

42:18.871 --> 42:22.578
But l sure wish you could do something
about this village.

42:22.675 --> 42:24.011
The village?

42:24.077 --> 42:28.251
Usually this time of year,
people are knocking on my door.

42:28.314 --> 42:32.255
''Can we help hang your decorations?''
They say.

42:32.318 --> 42:34.121
This year, l had to ask.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.423
And the answer was, ''No!''

42:36.489 --> 42:38.326
l mean, look at this!

42:39.025 --> 42:44.935
lt's like everyone's taken a bite
of the same piece of bad fruitcake!

42:47.533 --> 42:49.770
This is worse than we thought.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.340
Rothbart started with Mother and Rogers.

42:52.405 --> 42:55.277
-lf we can break that spell, maybe...
-l agree.

42:55.341 --> 42:57.478
l have a new idea to try on them!

42:57.543 --> 43:01.117
Great!
And l'm working on something, too, but...

43:01.414 --> 43:02.516
What?

43:02.648 --> 43:05.553
Well, l'm going to need Bromley's help.

43:05.618 --> 43:08.724
Which means l have to tell him
about Rothbart.

43:10.223 --> 43:13.762
When you do, make sure
you stand between him and the door.

43:15.895 --> 43:18.700
Rothbart's ghost? Where?

43:22.502 --> 43:24.839
Let me go! He's in here, l know it!

43:24.904 --> 43:26.307
No, no, no, no, he's not.

43:26.472 --> 43:29.511
A cold presence
just passed right though me!

43:29.575 --> 43:30.877
You're imagining things!

43:31.444 --> 43:33.581
Now, say something brave and you'll feel it!

43:35.748 --> 43:36.950
Say it, Brom!

43:38.018 --> 43:41.124
l wish l was snuggled up
to my Santa mug full of cocoa.

43:41.754 --> 43:45.761
Not exactly a war cry,
but we'll try to build on it.

43:46.859 --> 43:48.762
lfthere's one thing l know you can do, Brom,

43:49.295 --> 43:50.597
it's use this.

43:52.698 --> 43:54.168
We're gonna build a trap.

43:56.936 --> 44:01.845
Rothbart wants to destroy Christmas.
He has to be stopped, Brom.

44:04.177 --> 44:06.548
No one messes with my Christmas cocoa.

44:07.813 --> 44:09.316
Whatever it takes.

44:10.416 --> 44:12.787
What do you mean you're ''on strike?''

44:12.885 --> 44:15.590
Give me a new life now.

44:15.655 --> 44:17.492
That ain't negotiable!

44:17.557 --> 44:20.930
Okay, okay, then l'm staging a sit-down.

44:22.328 --> 44:24.298
l can force you to work!

44:25.331 --> 44:27.635
And waste your precious power?

44:31.270 --> 44:35.712
Face it.
Management has lost to the common cat.

44:36.176 --> 44:39.649
This is a face you don't wanna mess with.

44:43.949 --> 44:46.421
This is very unprofessional of you.

44:49.189 --> 44:51.626
-The Hag?
-Oh, snap!

44:52.492 --> 44:54.596
Merry Christmas!

44:57.663 --> 45:00.168
Hey, hey, it's me, your old partner.

45:03.136 --> 45:05.707
No, no, no. Calm down, will ya!

45:12.411 --> 45:15.718
You go away! Go away! Icky ghost!

45:17.583 --> 45:19.286
l'm your friend!

45:23.822 --> 45:26.728
Hey, did you do something with your hair?

45:29.962 --> 45:32.300
Look, it's me.

45:34.167 --> 45:35.836
Rothbart?

45:37.070 --> 45:39.407
You Big Naughty.

45:39.705 --> 45:44.714
Gosh, l missed ya so much!

45:44.910 --> 45:47.115
Bridgit miss those days, too.

45:48.114 --> 45:49.115
Who's Bridgit?

45:50.616 --> 45:51.684
Me Bridgit!

45:52.218 --> 45:53.587
Right! Right!

45:54.154 --> 45:59.430
Well, maybe Bridgit and Big Naughty
work together again?

46:00.193 --> 46:02.797
Hey, wait, we have a deal.

46:04.197 --> 46:07.436
Me not sure about that.

46:09.035 --> 46:11.873
Okay, me in. Me all the way in.

46:16.342 --> 46:18.212
Meet your replacement.

46:19.112 --> 46:20.214
Scab!

46:26.552 --> 46:29.891
l can't speak!

46:35.795 --> 46:39.903
l was iust making my special vocal
booster tea for Uberta's singers.

46:41.534 --> 46:42.802
Drink up!

46:44.204 --> 46:46.007
ls it possible, Ferdinand,

46:46.072 --> 46:51.949
that l ate or drank something
that made me lose my voice?

46:53.313 --> 46:55.617
Could there possibly be such a thing?

47:00.320 --> 47:02.724
Not it, not it, not it, not it, not it, not it.

47:02.822 --> 47:05.360
Got it. Unwashed root of periwinkle!

47:06.259 --> 47:08.930
lf not cleaned and prepared correctly,

47:09.729 --> 47:15.173
the tiniest particle
could render you silent in a snap.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.176
My cupcakes!

47:24.043 --> 47:29.888
Thank you, Ferdinand. Thank you very much.

47:30.683 --> 47:35.993
When Uberta's singers take their tea,
it'll have a little something extra

47:37.223 --> 47:40.862
that will leave them speechless.

47:41.527 --> 47:42.528
Treachery!

47:43.263 --> 47:47.537
-Uberta, l was iust...
-l know exactly what you were up to!

47:47.600 --> 47:51.874
Unwashed root of periwinkle?
How could you be so two-faced?

47:54.040 --> 47:57.012
The same way you could, only better!

47:57.476 --> 48:00.783
Are you saying you can trick and scam
better than me?

48:00.946 --> 48:03.651
l can double your double-cross anytime!

48:03.716 --> 48:06.354
Well, l'll see your double of my double-cross

48:06.485 --> 48:08.356
and raise you a hoodwink.

48:08.788 --> 48:10.892
l'll see your hoodwink and raise you

48:11.124 --> 48:13.027
a bamboozle and a flimflam!

48:13.293 --> 48:14.928
-Well, l'll see...
-Excuse me!

48:15.695 --> 48:17.965
l know this is a lot to ask at Christmas,

48:18.031 --> 48:21.871
but will the two ofyou please help me
with a very special item on my list?

48:22.768 --> 48:24.905
lt's kind of sneaky.

48:28.541 --> 48:30.177
l'm the King of Sneaky!

48:31.411 --> 48:33.915
l'm the Queen of all Sneakdom!

48:34.314 --> 48:37.520
Great. l'll get the sleigh ready.

48:38.951 --> 48:40.621
-l call shotgun!
-l call shotgun!

48:41.187 --> 48:43.391
-l said it first!
-Yeah.

48:43.989 --> 48:45.759
Orphans? Singing?

48:46.059 --> 48:47.327
Odette bring them in.

48:47.827 --> 48:48.862
Odette!

48:49.695 --> 48:51.765
They melt heart of Roger and U-Bertie.

48:52.631 --> 48:54.969
That's what give you brown-down.

48:55.068 --> 48:56.336
Brown out!

48:57.470 --> 49:00.309
My replacement is as sharp as beach ball.

49:02.608 --> 49:05.046
So where is she now?

49:05.711 --> 49:09.385
No, don't tell me. Making mittens
for little Siberians somewhere!

49:10.049 --> 49:12.687
No. She do that last week.

49:12.985 --> 49:16.525
Now she get Roger and U-Bertie
to help her with new thing.

49:18.358 --> 49:19.626
Like what?

49:19.792 --> 49:23.733
Me not sure, but me got good idea in skull.

49:24.197 --> 49:26.968
lt's good to know she's not iust a pretty face.

49:27.833 --> 49:30.872
What made me think
l could destroy Christmas

49:30.936 --> 49:33.474
with Derek and Odette working against me?

49:33.839 --> 49:37.780
They're like a perky little force field
of goodness.

49:41.114 --> 49:45.822
They got to go.
And l'm gonna deal with her first.

49:46.219 --> 49:48.623
Yeah, l got enough for that now.

49:51.024 --> 49:53.561
Odette's gonna ioin the catfight.

49:54.260 --> 49:55.729
Lead the way.

49:57.163 --> 49:59.500
Hello? The chimes?

50:00.699 --> 50:02.403
Those chimes!

50:02.468 --> 50:05.907
Don't worry. Me cut down chimes.

50:07.240 --> 50:11.915
Look like your replacement
got good idea in skull.

50:12.012 --> 50:15.284
Yeah, yeah, l hope you have a brown down!

50:22.322 --> 50:24.526
Come on. Giddy-up already!

50:28.461 --> 50:29.663
Too close.

50:31.497 --> 50:33.567
Patience a virtue!

50:34.500 --> 50:35.768
So where we headed?

50:36.036 --> 50:39.208
Odette, Roger and U-Bertie
in big room for sure!

50:39.439 --> 50:42.411
That where Odette make shoe for orphan,
food basket for tornado victim...

50:42.475 --> 50:44.912
Yeah, l got the point. Keep cutting.

50:47.146 --> 50:49.284
Are we all ready to go?

50:50.083 --> 50:55.092
Quite. As soon as a certain Lord
scooches over for a certain Queen.

50:55.521 --> 50:57.658
Oh, fine! Baby!

51:00.293 --> 51:01.294
Nope.

51:01.461 --> 51:04.600
-What's wrong now?
-lnsufficient scootage!

51:04.663 --> 51:06.768
l can still feel his cooties!

51:07.033 --> 51:08.602
Cooties? Well, l never!

51:10.269 --> 51:12.173
Come on, come on, come on.

51:15.808 --> 51:17.912
What are you up to, my dear?

51:20.946 --> 51:24.820
Chime repair.
Some tinkley-tinkies don't tinkle.

51:26.819 --> 51:30.526
How about a romantic ride
when Odette comes back with the sleigh?

51:31.557 --> 51:33.093
Odette's gone?

51:35.061 --> 51:36.062
Me too busy.

51:36.295 --> 51:40.837
lt won't be until later.
She hasn't even left yet.

51:45.605 --> 51:47.575
Move, before they leave!

51:49.109 --> 51:50.811
Come on, come on.

52:03.156 --> 52:05.960
''Me sure she in big room!''

52:09.195 --> 52:13.970
Go ahead, Odette!
Work your Christmas cheer

52:14.700 --> 52:19.242
'cause l'm gonna suck
every drop of peace and joy

52:19.305 --> 52:22.144
out of this entire kingdom.

52:26.312 --> 52:29.785
Every Christmas season,
as long as l can remember,

52:30.016 --> 52:32.019
my father and l would come here,

52:32.285 --> 52:34.288
to the Woodcutters' Village,

52:34.353 --> 52:36.658
and we'd make sure
that they had a Christmas

52:36.722 --> 52:40.229
with lots of good food and presents.

52:40.293 --> 52:42.196
lt's my first Christmas without him,

52:42.828 --> 52:46.435
but l couldn't miss coming.
Thanks for doing this with me.

53:01.681 --> 53:02.916
Okay, it's clear.

53:06.952 --> 53:07.953
Put that back.

53:08.021 --> 53:09.390
The Queen delivers the ham!

53:09.455 --> 53:10.657
Who made up that rule?

53:11.757 --> 53:13.727
l did, and l'm the Queen!

53:13.959 --> 53:15.262
l had it first!

53:15.961 --> 53:17.431
She's hogging the ham!

53:17.563 --> 53:19.566
You've got the potatoes and the stuffing!

53:19.732 --> 53:22.971
Two side dishes don't equal a ham!
Do they, Odette?

53:23.036 --> 53:24.605
Do two side dishes equal a ham?

53:24.970 --> 53:26.340
l'll carry the ham.

53:27.806 --> 53:30.646
Happy? Now neither of us has the ham!

53:59.405 --> 54:00.740
What is it, Momma?

54:01.041 --> 54:04.247
-lt's food.
-And presents?

54:04.310 --> 54:06.347
Yes, and presents!

54:06.746 --> 54:10.120
But you said
there wasn't going to be a Christmas.

54:10.716 --> 54:12.486
l did, but...

54:12.918 --> 54:14.621
But angels came?

54:14.820 --> 54:17.559
Yes, dear, angels came.

54:18.124 --> 54:20.261
Play, Father, keep playing that song!

54:20.326 --> 54:22.963
Merry Christmas, Rogers.

54:38.311 --> 54:43.921
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

54:43.982 --> 54:48.692
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

54:52.991 --> 54:54.428
Listen to you!

54:54.627 --> 54:58.735
-Not flat again, l hope?
-l'm afraid you are.

54:58.798 --> 55:02.972
Flat out perfect! Merry Christmas, friend.

55:03.036 --> 55:04.638
Merry Christmas!

55:04.804 --> 55:10.215
God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you despair

55:11.077 --> 55:12.212
Wonderful!

55:13.679 --> 55:16.184
Yes, and Merry Christmas to you!

55:16.382 --> 55:19.087
We love you! Merry Christmas!

55:19.185 --> 55:22.224
All right, floor it, Odette,
l've got geese to cook!

55:22.688 --> 55:25.126
Christmas Uberta is back!

55:25.791 --> 55:28.096
And so is the Christmas spirit.

55:28.328 --> 55:30.765
Comfort and ioy

55:30.863 --> 55:35.839
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

55:36.336 --> 55:37.337
No!

55:37.670 --> 55:40.042
Look what Christmas is doing to me!

55:40.539 --> 55:42.510
Yeah. Got it. Another brown-out.

55:43.143 --> 55:45.046
No! You don't get it!

55:45.444 --> 55:48.884
Christmas almost gave me a black out!

55:49.415 --> 55:53.623
Well, l wouldn't worry.
l'm sure Bridgit will fix everything.

55:54.053 --> 55:56.324
Yeah, that girl is bright as a...

55:56.922 --> 55:58.859
A little light bulb?

55:59.392 --> 56:01.529
Yeah, sure.

56:02.262 --> 56:05.901
Okay, you're back in for the full nine lives.

56:06.832 --> 56:08.202
Yes!

56:09.968 --> 56:12.841
Okay, again! From ze big finish!

56:13.173 --> 56:16.279
This is the last time, Jean-Bob.

56:16.575 --> 56:18.846
Yeah, we get the point.

56:19.445 --> 56:23.252
lf we pull too early, you'll ''miss ze kiss.''

56:24.250 --> 56:26.454
One, and-a-two...

56:26.652 --> 56:32.096
Gloria

56:32.158 --> 56:33.159
What the...

56:36.029 --> 56:37.965
When l get those nine lives,

56:38.031 --> 56:42.773
l'm gonna pick a fight
with the biggest, ugliest dog l can find.

56:43.703 --> 56:45.440
Okay, zere's applause.

56:45.938 --> 56:50.247
Girls approach me. Wait for it. Wait for it...

56:57.050 --> 56:59.754
Didn't you hear me say, ''Wait for it?''

57:00.353 --> 57:01.755
Come on, Romeo.

57:07.860 --> 57:09.730
l'll take that.

57:09.895 --> 57:12.400
Keep your paws off Royal property!

57:13.466 --> 57:15.770
So, what is this, a C9, maybe?

57:27.580 --> 57:29.417
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

57:31.384 --> 57:32.753
Oh, great!

57:32.985 --> 57:35.623
Zere is absolutely no escape.

57:38.724 --> 57:41.396
Except for running right past us.

57:42.528 --> 57:44.265
l'll explain later.

58:13.959 --> 58:19.904
There's a kitty l know
who's about to get nine shiny new lives.

58:20.733 --> 58:23.538
That guy looked a lot like...

58:23.602 --> 58:25.340
Don't say his name!

58:25.538 --> 58:27.975
lt's Rothbart's ghost.

58:28.241 --> 58:32.515
Great! You not only say ''Rothbart,''
you say ze ''ghost'' part, too!

58:46.292 --> 58:51.168
Question. How many cats does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

58:52.898 --> 58:56.639
Just one, ifyou promise him nine lives.

58:57.803 --> 59:02.812
Now, back on the tree.
When the lights are switched on,

59:02.975 --> 59:08.820
the Royal Christmas Tree and all those
precious ornaments will be destroyed.

59:09.282 --> 59:16.195
Then l'll have all the power l need
to finish off Derek and Odette.

59:19.625 --> 59:22.297
Voili. King Rothbart!

59:24.897 --> 59:28.104
Christmas Eve

59:28.968 --> 59:32.742
A special time of year

59:33.672 --> 59:36.311
Celebration

59:36.509 --> 59:39.081
Come one
Come all

59:39.245 --> 59:41.916

59:51.091 --> 59:52.860
-That's a good one!
-Bossy-boss!

59:53.859 --> 59:57.066
Derek doing big secret against you!

59:57.563 --> 59:58.998
Do you think he knows?

59:59.365 --> 01:00:02.738
l don't know. Go, keep an eye on it.

01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:04.871
Keep an eye on what?

01:00:04.937 --> 01:00:09.313
Never mind!
Come on, show me what he's up to, Brenda!

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.610
Bridgit!

01:00:15.848 --> 01:00:17.651
Okay, follow Bridgit.

01:00:18.151 --> 01:00:19.520

01:00:19.885 --> 01:00:20.886

Hello, Princey. Okay me come in?

01:00:28.528 --> 01:00:31.934
Sure. But close the door.
Top secret stuff here.

Me take peeky-peek. No!

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:47.349
You make a pretty good spy, Bridgit.

01:00:47.913 --> 01:00:50.318
See? He call me Bridgit!

01:00:50.916 --> 01:00:53.688
He shoulda called you a dirty sneak!

01:00:53.953 --> 01:00:55.956
Derek, he not done!

01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:57.090

He tell Kitty Kat, ''Keep an eye on it.''

01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:02.830
lt's too late, Little Prince.

01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:08.506
When Christmas is destroyed,
you and Swan Chica are next.

01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:10.504
Stay with him!

01:01:13.939 --> 01:01:18.915
My friends. My fellow citizens! Welcome.

01:01:19.245 --> 01:01:21.415

01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:24.785
Maestro.

01:01:34.327 --> 01:01:40.605
Joy to the world
The Lord is come

01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:47.613

01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:51.413

01:01:51.477 --> 01:01:52.478
What do you mean?

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:59.521
There he is! Keep an eye on that cat!

01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:10.033
Think small, Jean-Bob!
Find your inner tadpole!

01:02:10.663 --> 01:02:11.865
Okay, zat's iust weird.

01:02:12.298 --> 01:02:14.735
You've got to make yourself slimier!

Okay, sure. Let me iust get in touch
with my inner lawyer!

01:02:20.073 --> 01:02:23.979
While fields and floods

01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:27.483
Rocks, hills and plains

01:02:27.547 --> 01:02:30.920
Repeat the sounding ioy

01:02:30.983 --> 01:02:34.256
Repeat the sounding ioy

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.799
Repeat, repeat the sounding ioy

01:02:46.199 --> 01:02:48.436
Open sesame!

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:53.842
Open sesame seeds!

01:02:56.176 --> 01:02:59.081
Open sesame seed buns.

01:03:00.146 --> 01:03:01.982
Oh, brother!

01:03:02.715 --> 01:03:06.689
Here we come a-caroling
among the leaves so green

01:03:07.053 --> 01:03:11.094
Here we come a-wand'ring
So fair to be seen

01:03:11.157 --> 01:03:15.798

My kingdom for a hammer!

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:38.487
lf only we had a crow bar!

01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:48.968
The cattle are lowing
The Baby awakes

01:03:49.262 --> 01:03:56.209
The little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

01:03:56.502 --> 01:04:03.482
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky

01:04:03.609 --> 01:04:07.216
And stay by my cradle

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.392
'Til morning is nigh

01:04:20.526 --> 01:04:24.000
-Aren't they iust the sweetest things?
-lt's so beautiful.

01:04:29.935 --> 01:04:34.010
-You're through!
-Well done, Speed!

01:04:34.073 --> 01:04:36.711
Speed? What about the ''toolbox'' here?

01:04:38.544 --> 01:04:43.487
May the ornaments on this tree
inspire us to do good!

01:04:44.417 --> 01:04:47.122
And may this tradition live forever!

01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:52.428
Begin the countdown
to light the Royal Christmas Tree.

01:04:53.659 --> 01:04:56.164
All right, everybody. Now, attention.

01:04:56.562 --> 01:04:58.132
Yes, attention, attention.

01:04:58.698 --> 01:04:59.699
Ready?

01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:01.601
Let's go.

01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:03.537
-Ten!
-The Forbidden Arts!

01:05:04.704 --> 01:05:05.872
Nine!

01:05:07.173 --> 01:05:08.275
-Eight!
-Seven and a half.

01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:09.743
Rogers, stop!

01:05:09.809 --> 01:05:13.049
Seven. Six. Five.

01:05:13.112 --> 01:05:15.417
The bulb! Get the bulb!

01:05:15.514 --> 01:05:16.516
Four!

01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.819
Three!

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:20.554
-Two!
-Two!

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.024
Ready. One!

01:05:23.489 --> 01:05:25.025
lt's Christmas!

01:05:48.448 --> 01:05:50.585
Give me some skin, baby.

01:06:23.716 --> 01:06:24.884
Oh, no!

01:06:26.919 --> 01:06:28.188
Christmas is gone!

01:06:29.422 --> 01:06:31.225
Oh, dear, no!

01:06:39.598 --> 01:06:43.239
-He's...
-And he, and he...

01:06:43.336 --> 01:06:45.339
Let me help ya out there.

01:06:45.505 --> 01:06:49.379
''He's back and he's in the flesh.''

01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:01.890
l got rid ofyou once, l can do it again!

01:07:02.288 --> 01:07:05.594
We're gonna replay our final battle all right,

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:09.832
but first, we got a coronation to take care of.

01:07:17.236 --> 01:07:20.276
Long live the King.

01:07:22.942 --> 01:07:26.883
You ain't the only one
with a Christmas list, Princess.

01:07:27.313 --> 01:07:31.087
''Come back to life?'' Check.
''Destroy Christmas?'' Check.

01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:33.087
Take back the kingdom?

01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:37.424
Now that one's a little fuzzy.

01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:44.003
l mean, technically, yeah, checkerino.
l got the crown, l got the power.

01:07:44.497 --> 01:07:50.675
But in reality, l know you two
are gonna keep getting in my way,

01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:56.347
because you got the Christmas spirit
all year round.

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:02.153
But l'm gonna take care of that now
back at my castle.

01:08:04.317 --> 01:08:06.020
Yeah, that's what l said.

01:08:06.719 --> 01:08:09.057
The seat of government's
moving to Swan Lake

01:08:09.188 --> 01:08:12.128
and you're coming with me, Princess.

01:08:13.426 --> 01:08:15.229
Odette!

01:08:15.661 --> 01:08:20.136
Sorry, Derek, but l'm sure
you can find your own way there.

01:08:20.832 --> 01:08:24.240
And be sure to bring your A game.

01:08:33.345 --> 01:08:36.385
Careful, Derek! He's more powerful than ever!

01:08:36.482 --> 01:08:39.988
Yeah, he really Big Naughty now.

01:08:40.053 --> 01:08:42.823
l know. But now he's also mortal again.

01:08:50.828 --> 01:08:53.835
All right, Rothbart's taken Odette
back to Swan Lake!

01:08:54.567 --> 01:08:56.170
Quick! Hop on!

01:08:58.171 --> 01:09:00.642
Well, zat explains ze no seat belts!

01:09:03.341 --> 01:09:05.447
Less speed, Speed!

01:09:08.514 --> 01:09:11.185
Okay, you're fast, l get ze point!

01:09:22.728 --> 01:09:25.867
Now, that's what l call curb appeal!

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:30.640
lt iust screams
''comfort and luxury'' in a quiet rural setting!

01:09:32.104 --> 01:09:35.176
But a little cute for my taste.

01:09:38.044 --> 01:09:41.716
You like? l call it Gothic chic.

01:09:44.817 --> 01:09:48.925
And that's not the only thing
that's going retro, sweetheart.

01:09:49.354 --> 01:09:49.354
No. No!

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.432
Oh, no!

01:10:06.806 --> 01:10:08.676
lt's diii vu all over again.

01:10:09.075 --> 01:10:10.811
So l'm nostalgic.

01:10:18.651 --> 01:10:20.021
She's pinned.

01:10:22.388 --> 01:10:27.765
Do what you want with me,
but you will never destroy Christmas!

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:29.897
But l iust did!

01:10:29.995 --> 01:10:33.836
After today, do you know
what the people are gonna remember

01:10:33.899 --> 01:10:37.439
next Christmas
and every Christmas after that?

01:10:37.503 --> 01:10:38.938
This Christmas!

01:10:41.207 --> 01:10:46.817
The year their beloved tree and
all their cherished memories disappeared!

01:10:47.613 --> 01:10:49.416
Back off, ya big...

01:10:55.721 --> 01:10:59.195
My own first Christmas ornament!

01:10:59.725 --> 01:11:00.860
No!

01:11:00.959 --> 01:11:02.496
l have a nail appointment.

01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:09.538
And now for my second ornament.

01:11:12.072 --> 01:11:15.311
l'm not gonna blast you
like l did your little parrot.

01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:18.713
We're gonna stick with tradition on this one.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:26.124
When moonlight touches your wings,
you'll transform, all right,

01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:31.595
into my favorite Christmas decoration.

01:11:32.425 --> 01:11:33.660
Forever.

01:11:34.993 --> 01:11:37.966
The Master Hunter has arrived.

01:11:40.833 --> 01:11:45.342
Sorry to bring all your big plans
down to earth, Derek!

01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:48.175
What?

01:11:51.944 --> 01:11:53.747
Nice ankle bracelet.

01:11:53.879 --> 01:11:56.084
Come on! Let's go rough him up!

01:11:58.051 --> 01:11:59.787
Change her back!

01:12:00.186 --> 01:12:02.557
You want change, do you?

01:12:02.622 --> 01:12:04.292
Well...

01:12:08.694 --> 01:12:12.535
On second thought, my tennis elbow
is really acting up.

01:12:31.717 --> 01:12:32.718
Oh, no!

01:13:01.114 --> 01:13:03.084
The thrill of victory!

01:13:05.451 --> 01:13:08.623
Ze agony of defeat.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:37.984
Derek!

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:56.575
Pictures tell a story
of two hearts full of love

01:13:58.004 --> 01:14:02.212
They're sharing a memory
of caring

01:14:02.308 --> 01:14:06.282
and tender rejoicing

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.849
The song's doin' something.

01:14:09.049 --> 01:14:11.486
Keep singing, louder, louder!

01:14:12.018 --> 01:14:15.824
lt's the season of love

01:14:15.955 --> 01:14:21.099
that comes at Christmastime!

01:14:21.894 --> 01:14:24.032
We live it

01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:26.667
Love it

01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:30.373
Beg it to come

01:14:30.436 --> 01:14:33.475
And want it to stay

01:14:33.539 --> 01:14:38.815
To have this season each day

01:14:38.877 --> 01:14:43.921
lt's the season of love

01:14:56.062 --> 01:14:58.065
Merry Christmas!

01:14:59.265 --> 01:15:00.600
Okay, my turn.

01:15:02.302 --> 01:15:04.606
-Well?
-lt worked.

01:15:05.538 --> 01:15:10.047
But for a prince,
you're kind of short, slimy and green.

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.991
Odette!

01:15:26.792 --> 01:15:27.894
Derek!

01:15:34.467 --> 01:15:38.575
Derek. Don't leave me.

01:15:39.405 --> 01:15:40.406
l can't...

01:15:42.441 --> 01:15:47.485
You're everything that's good.

01:15:48.081 --> 01:15:49.082
No!

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:53.853
No!

01:15:58.158 --> 01:15:59.960
No! No!

01:16:00.826 --> 01:16:04.133
l can't hear

01:16:04.197 --> 01:16:09.907
your heart beating

01:16:09.968 --> 01:16:12.541
But l know

01:16:12.605 --> 01:16:18.249
you still hear me

01:16:19.345 --> 01:16:22.084
Great! Now we got aliens!

01:16:48.208 --> 01:16:49.843
Zank you, aliens.

01:16:52.878 --> 01:16:53.879
You're back.

01:16:58.084 --> 01:17:01.356
You saved Christmas

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:06.529
and it wasn't even on your list.

01:17:08.327 --> 01:17:11.267
No. Christmas saved us all.

01:17:31.584 --> 01:17:33.020
They're all gone.

01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:37.194
We'll start carving new ornaments
this very day.

01:17:45.298 --> 01:17:48.303
Looks like Rothbart lost the rematch.

01:17:57.943 --> 01:18:01.150
Christmas is the reason for the season

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:04.120
when Jesus Christ was born

01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.886
Jesus Christ was born

01:18:05.985 --> 01:18:09.592
Christmas is the season for love on earth

01:18:09.789 --> 01:18:13.229
Oh, bless that happy morn

01:18:14.827 --> 01:18:21.207
Peace and love, goodwill toward men
In praise we sing this day

01:18:22.068 --> 01:18:25.974
His blessed birth in Bethlehem

01:18:26.072 --> 01:18:30.246
The life, the truth, the way

01:18:33.146 --> 01:18:38.256
Our newest Christmas ornament,
honoring Derek and Odette!
