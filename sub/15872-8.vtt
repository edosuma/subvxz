00:00.065 --> 00:01.823
Previously on
The Lying Game...

00:02.078 --> 00:03.278
Ethan!

00:03.295 --> 00:05.396
You're still so
clearly into Sutton.

00:05.430 --> 00:07.064
Alec paid me.

00:07.098 --> 00:09.166
I don't know what you mean.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.200
About you.

00:11.536 --> 00:13.521
- You need to step out.
- No, I...

00:13.821 --> 00:15.437
I came to find
my birth mother,

00:15.458 --> 00:17.374
and you've held me here
against my will.

00:17.624 --> 00:19.025
What? What is going on?

00:19.059 --> 00:20.827
I thought I was going home.

00:20.861 --> 00:21.961
You are, Emma.

00:21.995 --> 00:23.596
Home to Las Vegas.

00:24.631 --> 00:25.998
I wanted tonight to be special.

00:26.033 --> 00:28.701
I'm really starting
to fall for you, Laurel.

00:31.605 --> 00:32.839
Laurel?

00:32.873 --> 00:34.607
I'm not gonna go anywhere, okay?

00:34.641 --> 00:35.942
You have to.

00:35.976 --> 00:37.610
<i>My pervy foster brother</i>

00:37.644 --> 00:38.911
<i>set me up and said I was</i>
<i>stealing.</i>

00:38.946 --> 00:40.680
Hey, Emma.

00:41.682 --> 00:42.815
So you've got a twin.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.750
What'd you do, kill her?

00:50.858 --> 00:52.758
I really need to get that.

00:52.793 --> 00:53.993
Is that so?

00:54.027 --> 00:56.596
Maybe you'd like
a mani-pedi, too.

00:56.630 --> 00:59.632
Your caseworker gets here,
you get your call.

01:01.034 --> 01:03.703
<i>Travis, school is</i>
<i>out of the question.</i>

01:03.737 --> 01:06.873
I told you where we'd meet,
so be there or forget it.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.743
Hey, everything okay?

01:10.777 --> 01:11.978
Yeah, it's fine.

01:12.012 --> 01:13.713
- Was that Sutton?
- Are you serious?

01:13.747 --> 01:14.981
She hasn't spoken
to me since she saw

01:15.015 --> 01:17.750
those pictures of us
kissing at homecoming.

01:17.784 --> 01:19.018
Well, there were
a lot of them.

01:19.052 --> 01:20.753
Guess she's still jealous.

01:20.787 --> 01:21.988
Why? It's not like
we're a couple.

01:22.022 --> 01:23.689
No one said we were.

01:23.724 --> 01:25.591
You want to tell me
what's going on?

01:25.626 --> 01:26.993
I mean, yesterday,
we were getting along fine,

01:27.027 --> 01:29.562
and now, all of a sudden, I'm
bothering the hell out of you.

01:29.596 --> 01:32.698
Let's just say, you can't
run from your past.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.700
Sooner or later,
it'll track you down.

01:34.735 --> 01:36.769
I don't know what people
around here have been

01:36.803 --> 01:38.638
telling you about me, but there's...
Ethan, I'm sorry.

01:38.672 --> 01:41.948
It's not... it's not you.

01:42.643 --> 01:43.876
It's about my life.

01:45.779 --> 01:47.613
Is that Sutton?

01:49.716 --> 01:51.717
Or not.

01:51.752 --> 01:53.653
I can't be
late for class.

01:53.687 --> 01:55.955
Wait, wait, come here.

01:55.989 --> 01:59.792
Look, I realize I screwed up,
all right?

01:59.826 --> 02:01.560
You and I make
a pretty good team.

02:01.595 --> 02:02.929
Just let me help you.

02:02.963 --> 02:06.799
I'm sorry, I just-- I have
a lot on my plate right now.

02:08.801 --> 02:10.735
Moved? No, that's not possible.

02:10.770 --> 02:13.572
We were just there last night.

02:13.607 --> 02:15.574
Well, moved where?

02:16.576 --> 02:17.677
Uh, well, can you tell me

02:17.711 --> 02:18.844
the address
of this new place?

02:18.879 --> 02:19.912
Confidential?

02:19.947 --> 02:21.480
Why would it be
confidential?

02:21.515 --> 02:23.549
At the request
of his mother?

02:24.751 --> 02:25.918
Okay, thanks.

02:27.921 --> 02:29.822
Oh, my God.

02:29.856 --> 02:32.692
Guys, they moved Eduardo
to another hospital.

02:34.628 --> 02:36.562
If I hadn't told him
my feelings,

02:36.596 --> 02:37.830
none of this
would've even happened.

02:37.864 --> 02:39.799
- That's not true.
- You can't say that.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.500
Okay, I'm sorry, guys.

02:41.535 --> 02:42.702
Maybe I should just go.
No.

02:42.736 --> 02:44.637
Not on my watch.

02:44.671 --> 02:46.505
Look, I know this is awful,

02:46.540 --> 02:48.507
but if you think your friends
are gonna let you

02:48.542 --> 02:49.976
go through it alone,
you're crazy.

02:50.010 --> 02:51.844
We're gonna go inside,
pop some popcorn,

02:51.878 --> 02:54.547
find some <i>Real Housewives</i>
to veg out to,

02:54.581 --> 02:55.881
whatever.

02:55.916 --> 02:57.817
But we're gonna
stick together, right?

02:57.851 --> 02:59.018
Sounds like a plan.

03:00.020 --> 03:01.821
You're the best.

03:03.957 --> 03:05.925
I'll join you guys later.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.527
I'm so sorry.

03:08.562 --> 03:10.830
I have to do... an errand.

03:10.864 --> 03:12.631
For my parents.

03:16.937 --> 03:18.738
I mean, seriously?

03:21.808 --> 03:23.509
Okay, that
was uncool.

03:23.543 --> 03:24.710
What?

03:24.745 --> 03:26.512
First of all, you're
running around

03:26.546 --> 03:27.847
all paranoid, convinced
that someone is after you.

03:27.881 --> 03:29.782
Now your best friend is
grieving, and you say

03:29.816 --> 03:31.884
you got to, what, pick up some
paper towels or something?

03:31.918 --> 03:33.753
You don't understand.

03:33.787 --> 03:34.954
No, I don't.

03:34.988 --> 03:36.889
'Cause in my book,
car wrecks, comas,

03:36.923 --> 03:39.625
almost dying sort of
trump birth mother search.

03:39.659 --> 03:41.494
This isn't just about that!

03:41.528 --> 03:43.529
Then tell me what it is about.

03:43.563 --> 03:44.797
Because that way,
I can go in there

03:44.831 --> 03:46.866
and try and
cover for you.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.667
I can't do this now.

03:48.669 --> 03:51.570
You must love doing
everything alone.

03:51.605 --> 03:54.507
No.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.909
No, I hate it.

04:08.555 --> 04:10.423
Still don't see why
we couldn't have worked this out

04:10.457 --> 04:11.424
in your bedroom last night.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.725
Much nicer venue.

04:12.759 --> 04:14.427
So what's your plan?

04:14.461 --> 04:15.895
Get me sent back to
foster care in Vegas?

04:15.929 --> 04:19.899
Look, I don't give a crap
about your Nancy Drew mystery.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.468
I just want a little piece
of the action.

04:22.502 --> 04:24.637
You find a time
the Mercers aren't home,

04:24.671 --> 04:25.738
leave a door unlocked...

04:25.772 --> 04:27.506
No, Travis.

04:27.541 --> 04:30.576
I can't. They have been
like family to me.

04:30.610 --> 04:33.646
And I'm sure you've been just
like family to them in return.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.880
You know, honest and up front.

04:34.915 --> 04:37.550
Chillax, sis.

04:37.584 --> 04:38.717
We're not gonna clean them out.

04:38.752 --> 04:40.619
Just lift a few things.

04:40.654 --> 04:42.555
We do it right,

04:42.589 --> 04:44.557
they don't even notice.

04:44.591 --> 04:46.525
Like this, for instance.

04:48.862 --> 04:50.563
Wait for my call.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.798
Knew I could count on you.

04:52.833 --> 04:56.569
After all, we're family.

in bed with my daughter,

05:23.797 --> 05:25.564
I liked him
a hell of a lot less.

05:25.599 --> 05:27.800
Again, nothing
happened.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.502
"Nothing happened." I just...
We fell asleep.

05:29.536 --> 05:31.403
I just find that
so hard to believe.

05:31.438 --> 05:32.738
We decided we
weren't ready.

05:32.772 --> 05:34.607
He wants to wait.

05:34.641 --> 05:36.408
He said that I was
worth waiting for.

05:36.443 --> 05:37.810
Well, he's right. You are.

05:37.844 --> 05:39.445
Still doesn't explain

05:39.479 --> 05:41.413
how you ended up
in that situation, I mean,

05:41.448 --> 05:42.648
on the floor
of some deserted house.

05:42.682 --> 05:44.517
He doesn't want to
live like that, Dad.

05:44.551 --> 05:46.452
He needs help.

05:46.486 --> 05:47.786
Okay, sweetheart,
I feel sorry for the guy,

05:47.821 --> 05:49.488
but the responsible
thing to do

05:49.523 --> 05:50.689
is contact the authorities.

05:50.724 --> 05:51.790
He'll get kicked out

05:51.825 --> 05:53.526
of Arroyo and
the golf team.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.860
I mean, that's his dream.

05:54.895 --> 05:56.795
Sutton, will you tell
them what happened in

05:56.830 --> 05:58.464
that documentary you saw?

05:58.498 --> 06:00.566
Uh, yeah,
it was really bad.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.436
This girl ran away
from this horrible family

06:04.471 --> 06:05.838
and ended up on the streets.

06:05.872 --> 06:07.773
- See?
- It's one example.

06:07.807 --> 06:09.608
You can't generalize

06:09.643 --> 06:12.845
about every foster family
in the United States of America.

06:12.879 --> 06:14.713
Okay, so it's Justin's fault
that he's all alone?

06:14.748 --> 06:16.515
Why should he have
to keep paying

06:16.550 --> 06:17.816
for stuff that happened
to his parents?

06:17.851 --> 06:19.618
Okay, I will
make some calls.

06:19.653 --> 06:22.555
We'll find him a place to stay

06:22.589 --> 06:24.557
so he that he can
stay in Arroyo.

06:24.591 --> 06:26.525
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

06:42.809 --> 06:44.710
If you're think of
getting rid of anything,

06:44.744 --> 06:47.713
I won't say
no to pearls.

06:49.716 --> 06:53.619
I just wanted to say thanks
for having my back in there.

06:53.653 --> 06:55.554
Yeah, sure.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.456
Justin seems great.

06:57.490 --> 06:58.624
You have no idea.

06:58.658 --> 07:00.526
I'm so glad you waited.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.595
You actually bought that
in there?

07:02.629 --> 07:03.596
There was no waiting

07:03.630 --> 07:04.797
at the Squatter Inn.

07:04.831 --> 07:06.765
Let's just say,
been there, done that.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.602
Are you sure you're not
moving a little too fast?

07:09.636 --> 07:12.438
To be honest,
I was...

07:12.472 --> 07:14.473
kind of scared.

07:14.507 --> 07:18.711
The first time was definitely
more weird than great.

07:18.745 --> 07:21.614
But he was just...

07:21.648 --> 07:25.517
so nice and
so caring.

07:25.552 --> 07:28.754
And that was
beautiful.

07:28.788 --> 07:31.390
This isn't just
some random hookup.

07:31.424 --> 07:32.658
We're in love.

07:32.692 --> 07:35.461
I mean, who am
I talking to?

07:35.495 --> 07:36.795
It's like with
you and Ethan.

07:36.830 --> 07:39.598
When you have something so
great, why would you wait?

07:41.501 --> 07:42.835
<i>Hey, guys.What say we</i>

07:42.869 --> 07:45.738
go down to the country club
and hit a few buckets?

07:45.772 --> 07:48.507
I'm kind of busy.

07:51.878 --> 07:55.748
No, I already have plans
with Char and Sutton.

07:55.782 --> 07:58.550
I'm really sorry about Eduardo.

07:59.619 --> 08:01.387
Hmm?

08:01.421 --> 08:05.424
I said I'm sorry about Eduardo.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.460
Why? I'll probably never
see him again.

08:08.495 --> 08:09.662
You got just what you wanted.

08:09.696 --> 08:11.830
Maddie, I know
I haven't always been

08:11.865 --> 08:14.466
a perfect parent.

08:14.501 --> 08:15.768
I want a do-over.

08:15.802 --> 08:17.469
A fresh start.

08:17.504 --> 08:19.672
Can I ask you something?

08:19.706 --> 08:20.673
Anything.

08:24.711 --> 08:27.579
What do you know
about Sutton's adoption?

08:27.614 --> 08:31.483
Only what
Ted's told me.

08:31.518 --> 08:34.453
Um, that the
past few months

08:34.486 --> 08:37.489
has been really rough
on him and Kristin both.

08:37.514 --> 08:39.397
With Sutton's search and all,
it's just...

08:39.525 --> 08:41.559
So, you guys
talk about it a lot?

08:41.594 --> 08:42.660
I mostly listen.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.497
He's taking this pretty tough.

08:45.532 --> 08:47.499
I just try to be there for him.

08:47.534 --> 08:49.601
Hmm.

08:49.636 --> 08:51.737
<i>I felt so awful</i>
<i>having to leave earlier.</i>

08:51.771 --> 08:53.472
<i>So, anyway,</i>

08:53.506 --> 08:55.474
are you sure
this isn't valuable?

08:55.508 --> 08:56.742
All costume pieces.

08:56.776 --> 09:00.446
Okay, I promise you
I will pay you back every cent,

09:00.480 --> 09:01.714
even if it takes me a while.

09:01.748 --> 09:03.349
Come on, can't
you at least

09:03.383 --> 09:05.317
give me a hint
what this is about?

09:05.352 --> 09:06.618
I told you.

09:06.653 --> 09:09.621
Charity work.

09:09.656 --> 09:12.458
I love charity work.

09:12.492 --> 09:13.792
And you're an awesome friend.

09:13.827 --> 09:15.828
Now, that I believe.

09:18.498 --> 09:20.766
<i>What's so funny?</i>

09:20.800 --> 09:23.369
An allergy
pillow protector.

09:23.403 --> 09:24.636
That may be a first.

09:24.671 --> 09:26.605
How is that
so hard to grasp?

09:26.639 --> 09:28.474
I have seasonal allergies,

09:28.508 --> 09:33.345
and this is a breeding ground
for dust mites and bacteria.

09:33.380 --> 09:37.349
A pillow protector
probably only costs...

09:37.384 --> 09:38.650
I have no idea.

09:38.685 --> 09:40.586
I bet it's not a lot, though.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.488
Let's focus here.

09:42.522 --> 09:43.822
The good news is,
you're a minor.

09:43.857 --> 09:46.658
They have to grant your initial
hearing within 48 hours.

09:46.693 --> 09:47.826
Hearing?

09:47.861 --> 09:49.461
What?

09:49.496 --> 09:52.698
I told you,
I haven't done anything.

09:52.732 --> 09:55.601
Truancy, delinquency,

09:55.635 --> 09:58.771
petty theft, assault,
identity theft,

09:58.805 --> 10:00.773
fraud, breaking
and entering.

10:00.807 --> 10:02.841
Just jump in when this
starts to ring a bell.

10:02.876 --> 10:05.411
This is all a misunderstanding.

10:05.445 --> 10:07.679
People are confusing me
with my identical twin sister.

10:07.714 --> 10:10.716
I'm gonna stop
you there, okay?

10:10.750 --> 10:15.554
And I am on your
side here, honestly.

10:15.588 --> 10:18.490
Word to the wise though,
suck it up and tell the truth,

10:18.525 --> 10:20.492
you get out fast.

10:20.527 --> 10:22.795
You start spinning wacko stories
about identical twins,

10:22.829 --> 10:25.597
and you can expect
to be in here a while.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.544
Not bad, sis, not bad.

10:38.578 --> 10:41.680
If I were you, I'd wait
till Vegas to fence it.

10:41.714 --> 10:43.749
Pawn it around here and it might
raise some questions.

10:43.783 --> 10:45.417
You know, we hit up

10:45.452 --> 10:46.685
a couple of your
friends' houses,

10:46.719 --> 10:47.886
we could score big-time.
No.

10:47.921 --> 10:49.721
This was a one-off, remember?

10:49.756 --> 10:50.756
That was our deal.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.424
Fair enough.

10:52.459 --> 10:53.859
I'll keep my end
of the deal.

10:53.893 --> 10:56.762
But I think we should seal
it to make it official.

11:02.368 --> 11:04.403
Get off me!

11:05.738 --> 11:08.407
Just sealing the deal.

11:10.313 --> 11:11.947
Ethan.
Wait.

11:17.714 --> 11:19.682
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:19.716 --> 11:21.417
So, about yesterday--

11:21.451 --> 11:22.885
I was feeling really
overwhelmed,

11:22.919 --> 11:24.753
and I'm sorry
if I was rude.

11:24.788 --> 11:26.889
You're a good friend;
we've been through a lot.

11:26.923 --> 11:28.924
Wasn't fair.

11:32.629 --> 11:37.533
And... here's where I was hoping
you would say something back.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.902
Like... we make a good team?

11:39.936 --> 11:42.438
Let me help you?

11:42.472 --> 11:44.573
I thought I said
that yesterday.

11:46.710 --> 11:48.711
I guess we're good.

11:52.515 --> 11:53.882
<i>Yeah, it's a room</i>
<i>where members sleep it off.</i>

11:54.259 --> 11:55.826
<i>Good think is, you're</i>
<i>right over the clubhouse.</i>

11:56.920 --> 12:01.757
It's not Buckingham Palace,
but it'll keep you in school.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.792
Are-Are you kidding me?

12:03.827 --> 12:05.794
This place is amazing.

12:05.829 --> 12:07.596
I talked to Mario in
the clubhouse, too.

12:07.630 --> 12:08.630
He's gonna throw you
a few shifts,

12:08.665 --> 12:09.832
shagging range balls.

12:09.866 --> 12:12.501
Give you a little extra
spending money.

12:12.535 --> 12:14.470
This is really nice of you,
Dr. Mercer.

12:14.504 --> 12:16.605
I don't know what to say.

12:16.639 --> 12:18.607
I know you've been dealt a
pretty tough hand, Justin,

12:18.641 --> 12:20.442
and I just want you to
know that I appreciate

12:20.477 --> 12:21.877
that you've been a
gentleman with my daughter.

12:21.911 --> 12:23.412
Of course.

12:23.446 --> 12:24.580
Should that change, though,

12:24.614 --> 12:26.648
I will have to kill you.

12:29.586 --> 12:30.786
I'm kidding.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.788
But this room is
off-limits to Laurel.

12:32.822 --> 12:34.556
Same goes for you
in her bedroom.

12:34.591 --> 12:35.657
Are we clear on that?

12:35.692 --> 12:37.693
You have my word.

12:37.727 --> 12:39.795
I gotta hand it to you-- I mean,
you certainly travel light.

12:39.829 --> 12:41.764
No--

12:42.866 --> 12:44.800
This is, uh...

12:44.834 --> 12:46.568
That's okay. Hey...

12:46.603 --> 12:50.539
I'm a surgeon--
nobody touches my instruments.

12:50.573 --> 12:53.909
All right, well,
enjoy your new digs.

13:01.484 --> 13:03.452
You really think
this is a smart idea?

13:03.486 --> 13:05.387
Honey, come on!
This is Sedona.

13:05.422 --> 13:06.755
Look at this place.

13:06.790 --> 13:09.358
A weekend, no kids,

13:09.392 --> 13:11.760
no stress,
just the two of us.

13:11.795 --> 13:16.532
Well, and 2,000 deadly dull
plastic surgery colleagues.

13:16.566 --> 13:18.600
Okay, first off: ouch.

13:18.635 --> 13:21.637
Second, look-- I'll go
to two seminars max.

13:21.671 --> 13:24.773
The rest, it will be swimming,
biking, spa treatments--

13:24.808 --> 13:27.709
this'll be good for us,
to be a couple.

13:27.744 --> 13:30.479
You're really not concerned
about this at all?

13:30.513 --> 13:31.780
Of course
I'm concerned, okay?

13:31.815 --> 13:33.715
Aren't we supposed
to trust our kids?

13:33.750 --> 13:35.818
Okay, our ears are burning.

13:35.852 --> 13:38.420
Your mother and I
are going away this weekend.

13:38.455 --> 13:40.789
Oh, yeah! That plastic
surgery conference.

13:40.824 --> 13:42.558
Ugh! Just the sound of it.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.660
Romantic getaway-- yes.

13:44.694 --> 13:46.428
So here we go, house rules:

13:46.463 --> 13:48.630
No parties, okay?

13:48.665 --> 13:53.502
No boys, no booze,
no Justin's place.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.471
So, basically, no fun.

13:55.505 --> 13:56.538
See? They get it.

13:56.573 --> 13:58.540
Yeah. You can
totally trust us.

13:58.575 --> 14:01.376
I thought I could always
trust you; it's just, you...

14:01.411 --> 14:04.613
Okay, Mom-- Justin-- the whole
thing with that was a mistake.

14:04.647 --> 14:05.781
I won't happen again,

14:05.815 --> 14:07.483
I promise.
We'll be good, right?

14:07.517 --> 14:08.484
Definitely.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.419
You guys should go.

14:10.453 --> 14:11.720
Okay.
See? We got permission.

14:11.754 --> 14:13.755
I think we need this.

14:19.796 --> 14:22.698
We are so going to
blow the roof off this place.

14:28.838 --> 14:30.806
- Hello?
- You lied to me.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.741
Annie?

14:32.775 --> 14:34.743
All this time,
you let me believe

14:34.777 --> 14:36.512
that I killed my daughter.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.680
Now, you know that's crazy.

14:38.715 --> 14:41.783
Sutton told me Emma is alive.

14:41.818 --> 14:44.386
Sutton is a schizophrenic.

14:44.420 --> 14:45.521
You're a liar!

14:45.555 --> 14:46.688
She has been diagnosed with

14:46.723 --> 14:49.658
adolescent onset
schizophrenia, Annie.

14:49.692 --> 14:51.627
She stopped
taking her medication.

14:51.661 --> 14:53.495
I'm really sorry
you had to meet her like that.

14:53.530 --> 14:55.764
She was such
a lovely young girl.

14:55.798 --> 14:57.466
All these lies.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.735
She has a loving family
now, Annie.

14:59.769 --> 15:02.471
They'll care for her;
give her the help she needs.

15:02.505 --> 15:03.739
Leave this one alone.

15:03.773 --> 15:06.675
Let this story have
a happy ending.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.378
What about my happy ending?

15:20.961 --> 15:21.891
You look pretty.

15:21.892 --> 15:22.993
Mm! You think?

15:23.026 --> 15:25.094
I'd like to do you
right here.

15:25.128 --> 15:26.862
As poetic as that sounds,

15:26.896 --> 15:29.164
it's a little unhygienic
around food prep.

15:33.169 --> 15:35.304
- My bad.
- I'll get it.

15:35.338 --> 15:37.306
Trying to use adult glassware
was clearly a mistake.

15:37.340 --> 15:41.176
It's fine. I'll stick to the
casual elegance of red plastic.

15:41.211 --> 15:42.878
My God, you were cute!

15:42.912 --> 15:45.914
Like, kid model cute.

15:45.949 --> 15:49.285
You say that like I've turned
into some hideous beast.

15:49.319 --> 15:52.254
Ah, you're okay-- I mean, like,
in a first wife sort of way.

15:52.289 --> 15:54.256
Okay, that's it, you're dead.

15:57.994 --> 16:00.195
It's all fun
until someone ends up in tears.

16:02.065 --> 16:03.932
What is your obsession with
family albums, anyway?

16:03.967 --> 16:05.234
Get off your butt
and come help me.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.137
Hey, I have years
to catch up on.

16:13.771 --> 16:16.740
You and Justin seem
really great together.

16:16.774 --> 16:19.676
Yeah... he's pretty amazing.

16:21.813 --> 16:23.513
Hey, are you okay?

16:23.548 --> 16:25.616
Seem kind of sad.

16:25.650 --> 16:26.617
Where's Ethan?

16:26.651 --> 16:28.652
Hello!

16:28.686 --> 16:30.687
Hey.

16:30.722 --> 16:33.457
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

16:33.491 --> 16:35.592
- Good.
- Hi!

16:35.627 --> 16:37.761
- Good. How are you doin'?
- Good.

16:38.696 --> 16:40.797
Thayer.

16:51.568 --> 16:52.601
Hey...

16:54.254 --> 16:56.555
are you all right?

16:56.590 --> 16:58.557
Oh... yeah.

17:01.294 --> 17:03.262
I'm going to go
out on a limb here--

17:03.296 --> 17:05.431
does this have
anything to do with Ethan?

17:05.464 --> 17:08.400
Can someone please
tell me what that guy has

17:08.435 --> 17:10.234
that's so special?

17:10.270 --> 17:12.338
I mean, doesn't that intense
brooding shtick get old?

17:12.372 --> 17:15.307
We had a fight.

17:15.342 --> 17:18.410
Not a fight, but...

17:18.444 --> 17:20.279
a stupid argument at school.

17:20.313 --> 17:24.316
Oh, but I thought
you guys were, uh... broken up?

17:24.351 --> 17:26.050
Yeah.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.219
But...

17:27.252 --> 17:29.455
But you don't want
to be broken up.

17:29.489 --> 17:31.156
I don't know.

17:31.191 --> 17:33.292
And you know
how he feels, obviously.

17:33.326 --> 17:36.128
No, I... I don't know.

17:36.162 --> 17:38.130
Uh-huh.

17:38.164 --> 17:40.366
Of all times I really need
to talk to somebody--

17:40.400 --> 17:42.301
not that I would ever talk
to Sutton about this...

17:42.335 --> 17:44.503
Uh-huh. Of course.

17:44.537 --> 17:45.537
Do you mind?

17:45.572 --> 17:48.273
It's... a little rude.

17:48.308 --> 17:49.508
Right. Sorry.

17:51.144 --> 17:53.278
Can I ask you something?

17:53.313 --> 17:54.413
Not that it's
any of my business,

17:54.447 --> 17:57.549
but it does affect
my situation--

17:57.584 --> 18:00.386
what is going on with
you and Sutton?

18:02.322 --> 18:06.091
Here's the deal:

18:06.126 --> 18:07.192
Nothing.

18:07.227 --> 18:10.129
The thing with Sutton
was a mistake.

18:12.165 --> 18:16.035
It was a result
of misread cues...

18:16.069 --> 18:17.236
regrettable...

18:17.270 --> 18:18.337
disastrous...

18:18.371 --> 18:20.305
the sooner forgotten the better.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.441
At least those
were the words she used

18:22.475 --> 18:25.110
to soften
the blow for me.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.079
Sorry.

18:27.113 --> 18:29.656
Yeah, so was I.

18:29.657 --> 18:31.291
And then I got mad.

18:31.326 --> 18:32.492
And, in fact, I told her

18:32.527 --> 18:35.562
she had to go find
a new place to live...

18:35.596 --> 18:37.631
which is probably why
she's gone AWOL.

18:37.665 --> 18:40.400
And Sutton is still
into Ethan.

18:40.435 --> 18:41.702
Big-time.

18:41.736 --> 18:43.637
That's why I couldn't
be around her.

18:43.671 --> 18:46.373
Even though she's totally
kidding herself.

18:46.407 --> 18:47.574
Why do you say that?

18:47.608 --> 18:49.676
Are you seriously that naive?

18:50.678 --> 18:54.381
You really don't see why?

18:54.415 --> 18:55.582
The reason
she's kidding herself

18:55.616 --> 18:57.751
is because that guy's
so into you.

18:57.785 --> 19:00.287
As for Sutton-- who knows?

19:01.422 --> 19:03.256
Is that who you were texting?

19:03.291 --> 19:04.558
Oh, no, that was Ethan.

19:04.592 --> 19:06.360
I was just telling him
to get his sorry ass

19:06.394 --> 19:07.427
over to this party.

19:07.462 --> 19:10.597
You two were made
for each other.

19:10.631 --> 19:12.466
Let someone be happy, right?

19:15.436 --> 19:17.471
<i>Didn't I tell you</i>
<i>this would be great?</i>

19:17.505 --> 19:18.705
It has been nice.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.574
And, you know, honestly,
I haven't worried

19:20.608 --> 19:22.342
about things at home once.

19:22.377 --> 19:23.710
See?

19:23.745 --> 19:26.346
Gotta be able
to trust your kids.

19:26.381 --> 19:29.616
Every once in a while, it's okay
to leave your problems behind.

19:29.650 --> 19:30.751
Mm.

19:33.354 --> 19:34.421
Ted?

19:34.455 --> 19:36.690
Ted Mercer?

19:36.724 --> 19:39.393
It's me-- Tom.

19:39.427 --> 19:40.761
Tom List?

19:40.795 --> 19:42.329
Craniofacial.

19:42.363 --> 19:43.530
Hey... hey, buddy.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.298
I haven't seen
you guys since

19:45.333 --> 19:47.601
that insane weekend
in Santa Barbara.

19:47.635 --> 19:49.436
Gotta be 20 years.

19:51.406 --> 19:52.406
Annie, right?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.574
Kristin.

19:54.609 --> 19:56.543
That's my wife...

19:56.577 --> 19:58.412
Kristin.

19:58.446 --> 19:59.513
Senior moment.

19:59.547 --> 20:00.747
I'm the worst with names.

20:00.782 --> 20:03.417
Especially after a few
too many martinis.

20:03.451 --> 20:04.518
It's good
to bump into you again, Ted.

20:04.552 --> 20:06.486
Kristin.

20:06.521 --> 20:07.554
Have a good weekend.

20:07.588 --> 20:09.356
Yeah, you, too.

20:14.629 --> 20:16.396
Don't be mad at me.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.980
I didn't want you
to get in trouble.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.784
It's not like it would
have been your first strike.

34:32.819 --> 34:34.485
And that's the entire reason?

34:34.520 --> 34:37.355
Well, yeah!

34:37.389 --> 34:38.590
What else would there be?

34:38.623 --> 34:40.759
What are you not telling me?

34:40.793 --> 34:43.661
I was embarrassed, okay?

34:43.696 --> 34:47.732
I was ashamed about
what I come from.

34:47.766 --> 34:50.502
You do realize
I live in a trailer.

34:50.536 --> 34:54.406
I'm surrounded by rusty
motorcycles and spare car parts.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.742
But all you've seen me
as is this princess

34:57.777 --> 34:59.478
wearing Sutton's
gorgeous clothes,

34:59.512 --> 35:01.313
and driving her swanky car.

35:01.347 --> 35:03.548
And it was this fantasy,
and I didn't want it to end.

35:03.583 --> 35:08.520
But I knew that
if you saw this--

35:08.554 --> 35:12.724
saw who I really was--

35:12.758 --> 35:14.759
it'd just be over.

35:14.794 --> 35:18.797
That may be the dumbest
thing you've ever said.

35:22.802 --> 35:27.305
Plus, I was afraid
you might kill him.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.508
And I wasn't very far off.
I mean, look at us.

35:29.542 --> 35:31.610
All of a sudden, we're
in a Coen Brothers movie.

35:34.380 --> 35:35.714
He's fine.

35:35.748 --> 35:37.682
I mean, the guy deserves
a lot worse than what he got.

35:37.717 --> 35:40.452
I knew there was someone
in the house when I got up

35:40.486 --> 35:43.655
to get the phone.
The phone?

35:43.689 --> 35:45.457
Who was calling in
the middle of the night?

35:48.661 --> 35:51.630
Las Vegas
Juvenile Detention Center.

35:51.664 --> 35:52.764
You don't think...

35:52.798 --> 35:56.735
Oh, my God... Sutton?

35:56.769 --> 35:59.704
<i>Hey, I'm home.</i>

35:59.739 --> 36:03.642
Sutton?
Rise and shine.

36:09.415 --> 36:10.582
Hello?

36:10.616 --> 36:12.384
Laurel, thank God.
It's Sutton.

36:12.418 --> 36:15.487
Hey, Sutton, are you...
at Ethan's?

36:15.521 --> 36:16.755
No, why would you think that?

36:16.789 --> 36:19.524
Well, you were pretty buzzed
last night and basically

36:19.559 --> 36:22.761
throwing yourself at him by
the end of the night, so...

36:22.795 --> 36:24.429
Hello?

36:24.463 --> 36:26.498
Girls?

36:26.532 --> 36:28.567
Hold on.
Empty sighting.

36:28.601 --> 36:30.769
Hello!

36:36.709 --> 36:40.445
Dude, you gotta come home right
now. Mom and Dad just got back.

36:40.479 --> 36:42.647
Wait, no! I need help.
I'm stuck in Ju...

36:51.757 --> 36:53.758
Come on!

36:53.793 --> 36:56.361
Sorry, you know the rules.
One phone call.

36:56.395 --> 36:59.364
I... No, I-I need to
get a message to somebody.

36:59.398 --> 37:00.565
You don't understand.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.301
Mm-hmm.

37:04.437 --> 37:05.770
Letter's always nice.

37:09.342 --> 37:11.409
Hello, darling.

37:11.444 --> 37:13.712
- You guys are back early.
- We wanted to catch you

37:13.746 --> 37:16.281
in the act of throwing
that big blowout party.

37:16.315 --> 37:19.718
Yes, well, as you can see,
it's all cleaned up.

37:19.752 --> 37:21.753
That's a nice bracelet.
I haven't seen that before.

37:21.787 --> 37:25.357
Yeah. Where'd you get that?

37:25.391 --> 37:28.727
Oh... um...
a little vintage shop downtown.

37:28.761 --> 37:32.530
You always have such a good eye
for jewelry.

37:32.565 --> 37:34.332
Yeah, no kidding.

37:34.367 --> 37:35.567
Where's Sutton?

37:35.601 --> 37:37.502
Probably having breakfast
at the club.

37:37.536 --> 37:39.504
She's such a princess.

37:41.407 --> 37:43.575
<i>Hey, Mom and Dad...</i>

37:43.609 --> 37:46.344
<i>you should know that the girl</i>
<i>living in my room right now</i>

37:46.379 --> 37:48.613
<i>and calling herself "Sutton"</i>
<i>isn't me.</i>

37:48.648 --> 37:52.651
<i>She's stolen my identity,</i>
<i>my family and friends,</i>

37:52.685 --> 37:54.619
<i>and I'm now afraid</i>
<i>of how far she'll go</i>

37:54.654 --> 37:56.655
<i>to keep me from taking</i>
<i>my life back.</i>

38:01.460 --> 38:03.328
What are you looking at?

38:03.362 --> 38:06.498
Didn't we have an old photograph
of Annie Sewell in here?

38:06.532 --> 38:08.400
This isn't because of what that
drunk said

38:08.434 --> 38:09.467
at the conference, is it?

38:09.502 --> 38:11.269
I don't know.

38:11.304 --> 38:14.439
I just can't seem to get her out
of my head for some reason.

38:14.473 --> 38:18.410
I could swear we
had an old photograph.

38:18.444 --> 38:23.348
You know, I haven't
looked at that thing in years.

38:23.382 --> 38:25.483
Hey, one of the pages
has been torn out.

38:25.518 --> 38:28.420
Could've been one of the kids
when they were younger.

38:28.454 --> 38:30.455
What happened to her?

38:30.489 --> 38:32.324
Annie Sewell.

38:32.358 --> 38:34.459
Who knows?

38:34.493 --> 38:37.462
I think she pretty much fell off
the grid.

38:48.307 --> 38:50.408
Annie?

38:50.443 --> 38:53.311
Time for your meds.

38:55.314 --> 38:57.515
Annie?

39:02.254 --> 39:04.322
Ms. Hobbs?

39:05.117 --> 39:06.351
Doctor?

39:12.855 --> 39:15.223
What makes you think I won't go
straight to the cops, tell them

39:15.224 --> 39:18.296
all about Emma's sister scam?
Go ahead.

39:19.014 --> 39:21.115
Something tells me they're gonna
be more interested in you.

39:21.149 --> 39:23.050
Breaking and entering,

39:23.084 --> 39:25.252
extortion, sexual assault.

39:25.287 --> 39:28.022
That's ten to 20, easy.

39:28.056 --> 39:29.089
What are you, a legal expert?

39:29.124 --> 39:31.358
No, I'm an eyewitness, douche.

39:31.393 --> 39:34.228
Okay, so it was definitely
Sutton who called your house.

39:34.262 --> 39:37.164
Apparently, she was sent from
some psych clinic in L.A.

39:37.199 --> 39:38.294
Oh, my God.

39:38.319 --> 39:40.260
Yeah, well, here's the good
news, is they dropped Emma's

39:40.302 --> 39:44.104
assault charges on this idiot.
So, Sutton's being released.

39:44.139 --> 39:46.240
Okay, well, why isn't she
answering the phone?

39:46.274 --> 39:48.075
I've called her and texted her.

39:48.109 --> 39:49.176
Probably took her phone.

39:49.211 --> 39:51.145
Who would post bail
for Emma Becker?

39:51.179 --> 39:53.380
They wouldn't give me
any more information. Sorry.

39:54.416 --> 39:56.250
Wow!

39:56.284 --> 39:58.118
You got both
these dudes whipped.

39:58.153 --> 40:00.120
Must be making it
worth their while, huh?

40:00.155 --> 40:03.057
You want to take a trip
to the hospital, huh?

40:03.091 --> 40:05.159
Hey, hey, relax, relax!

40:16.204 --> 40:17.238
All right.

40:17.272 --> 40:18.973
Okay.

40:19.007 --> 40:20.241
Come on.

40:20.275 --> 40:22.042
Here's the deal.

40:22.077 --> 40:24.245
You're gonna get in this
crapbox and you're gonna go

40:24.279 --> 40:26.080
to whatever hole
you crawled out of.

40:26.114 --> 40:29.049
No stops, no detours.

40:29.084 --> 40:31.218
Oh, and do obey
the speed limits.

40:33.188 --> 40:37.057
If I ever catch you
in Phoenix again...

40:37.092 --> 40:41.128
a prison sentence will be
the least of your worries.

41:01.182 --> 41:04.118
We do hope you've
enjoyed your stay.

41:04.152 --> 41:06.120
Come back and visit anytime.

41:09.157 --> 41:11.158
So, you're seriously
not gonna tell me

41:11.192 --> 41:13.127
who signed to let me out?

41:13.161 --> 41:17.064
Told you, it says "anonymous."
Doesn't happen every day.

41:17.098 --> 41:20.034
You must have friends
in high places.

41:46.194 --> 41:49.029
Yo! Emma!

41:49.064 --> 41:51.231
Get over here!
Hi...

41:51.266 --> 41:53.133
Thought everybody got
one call from Juvie.

41:53.168 --> 41:55.969
Or is that just, like,
urban legend?

41:56.004 --> 41:58.238
Uh, no, that's
true, actually.

41:58.273 --> 42:01.175
Uh-huh. And you don't use yours
to call your best friend?

42:01.209 --> 42:04.311
Bi-atch, you got some 'splaining
to do. Get in the car.

42:04.346 --> 42:07.948
Sorry. Do you remember my,
uh, cousin Norman?

42:07.982 --> 42:11.085
The like, thick-necked--
do you want a chip?--

42:11.119 --> 42:13.120
bull-neck, ex-Marine
homophobic guy

42:13.154 --> 42:15.089
who has like all the
Patti LuPone CDs?

42:15.123 --> 42:16.890
I mean, dude, like, don't ask,

42:16.925 --> 42:19.193
don't tell,
just don't kid yourself.

42:19.227 --> 42:21.061
Uh... right... No...

42:21.096 --> 42:22.528
He works Juvie security,

42:22.553 --> 42:24.046
and he found out that
you were getting sprung.

42:24.099 --> 42:27.000
So, lucky for you,
I was able to go home,

42:27.035 --> 42:29.002
and, uh, jumpstart
the ol' Pequod.

42:32.006 --> 42:34.942
Thanks, Lexi, for not leaving me
on the side of the road

42:34.976 --> 42:39.046
in the desert
and having to walk home.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.248
Right, thank you.

42:41.282 --> 42:42.916
It's cool.

42:42.951 --> 42:44.151
Dude, what happened to

42:44.185 --> 42:46.987
"I'm gonna call you
every three days," huh?

42:47.021 --> 42:48.989
Did you hear from You-Know-Who?

42:49.023 --> 42:50.157
Do you know what
your next move is gonna be?

42:53.128 --> 42:56.964
It's cool. You can just tell
me everything while we drive.

42:56.989 --> 43:00.989
