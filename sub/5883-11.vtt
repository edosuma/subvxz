WEBVTT

00:50.634 --> 00:52.635
Sally! Bobby!

00:53.971 --> 00:55.805
They sell it at Woolworths.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.016
There's a section that says
"Halloween costumes."

00:59.101 --> 01:02.562
You'll wear it once.
Plus, it's made out of plastic and it's crap.

01:02.646 --> 01:06.899
-l'm always gonna love Minnie Mouse.
-l'm gonna be an astronaut.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.070
Didn't you hear me? The luggage.

01:11.155 --> 01:14.198
-l'll go get it.
-That's not the point. They don't listen.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.950
There's more? lt's a week.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.036
We're going for a week?
Are we gonna miss Halloween?

01:19.121 --> 01:21.873
They have Halloween there.
You'll go with your cousins.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.959
Say goodbye to your father,
then get the bags.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.007
They have a Woolworths in Philly, too.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.557
-l only have $40.
-Swing by the bank.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.894
There should be at least $200
in your checking. That's plenty.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.854
You have no more money?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.108
Take care.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.655
Roger, l think you remember...

01:54.740 --> 01:58.367
-Annabelle.
-You look wonderful.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.206
You look exactly the same.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.254
-This is Annabelle... What is it again?
-Mathis.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.381
l can't tell if you two
know each other or not.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.217
-Don Draper.
-Hello.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.303
Please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.

02:18.931 --> 02:22.099
How the hell were you in town
and not look me up?

02:23.018 --> 02:27.063
l wasn't sure about coming back here.
l'm running the company now.

02:27.231 --> 02:30.399
-You divorced what's-his-name?
-No, David died,

02:30.776 --> 02:34.570
and because of my father's will,
the company went back to me.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.074
-l'm sorry.
-Fifty-one years old. Lung cancer.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.871
That's too bad.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.960
-So...
-So, yes, if you're open to it.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.547
Caldecott Farms, l'm sure you've heard,

02:52.840 --> 02:56.551
had a public relations crisis
followed by disastrous sales.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.137
-l hadn't heard.
-The Misfits, the movie. Clark Gable.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.350
lt was about horses
being turned into dog food.

03:04.810 --> 03:08.604
-There was an exposÃ©.
-We were singled out. l don't know why.

03:08.939 --> 03:12.316
You don't know why? She owns
a horse farm that makes dog food.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.527
We had a 1 5% share of the market,

03:14.611 --> 03:17.530
but now Benton & Bowles
has dropped us for Gravy Train.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.615
Well, that was a mistake.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.578
People eat cow but they call it beef.
Chicken is poultry.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.913
-Pig...
-We got it, sweetheart.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.543
Well, there is no other word for horse meat.
l thought maybe you could invent one.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.921
-What do you think, Don?
-l think it's a tall order.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.758
-Do you have to use horse meat?
-All dog food is horse meat.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.553
People eat it all over the world.
l've eaten it. lt's delicious.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.055
-lt's like venison.
-l've eaten it.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.225
Well, l'll tell you
what l'm telling the Avenue.

03:46.310 --> 03:50.104
-Best idea gets my business.
-How long do we have?

03:50.647 --> 03:54.483
l'm in town until Friday,
but only the big firms are rushing.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.446
Well, l'm not gonna sit here
and brag about how big l am.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.325
Roger.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.623
Bert, l have two simple rules.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.627
l don't want to change the recipe.
lt's all meat.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.630
And two,
my father named it Caldecott Farms.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.424
Don't change the name.
Don't change the product.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.760
-Got it.
-Walk me out?

04:26.308 --> 04:30.686
We had their business before,
but her father was a son of a bitch.

04:31.688 --> 04:35.441
You know, people spend more money
on dog food than baby food.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.526
l'll put the fellas on it.

04:41.531 --> 04:45.284
-ls that really necessary?
-You've never walked in high heels.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.913
No, coming in here.
What are you doing here?

04:49.539 --> 04:52.041
l wanted to see you,
and l need something new.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.211
-l'll bet you do.
-For my business.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.255
Besides, you're married, aren't you?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.466
-l am.
-Still or again?

05:01.551 --> 05:05.554
-You know it's again. Don't get cute.
-l heard she's a teenager.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.809
Probably too jealous to let you
have a business dinner with me.

05:09.893 --> 05:13.437
-Gonna need a reason.
-Because l know you're good at this.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.398
Advertising, l mean.

05:16.942 --> 05:20.111
-Tomorrow night. Somewhere French.
-Avec plaisir.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.829
All the lights were on.
l figured you'd be home.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.707
l knew you were coming over.
Thought it might be dark when l got home

05:32.791 --> 05:35.751
and l didn't want the Mckays
to see you turning on the lights.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.753
That's very thoughtful.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.974
l'm making spaghetti with cream
and butter and cheese.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.185
-And hot pepper?
-Yes.

05:54.021 --> 05:58.024
l had it like that in Little ltaly.
l love that place.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.528
Believe it or not,
l get treated very well there.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.451
l wish l could take you there.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.704
l know.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.628
Don, l swear l'm not talking
about our future.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.800
-l entered into this with my eyes open.
-l pushed you.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.637
What does it matter?

06:30.766 --> 06:34.060
Here we are, and l look at your life,

06:35.437 --> 06:38.355
and even if l remove myself
from the picture,

06:39.608 --> 06:41.817
l see a man who is not happy.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.198
l'm happy now.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.954
What?

06:58.668 --> 07:02.713
Okay.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.761
l'm going to lie down.
Come get me when you want to.

07:14.017 --> 07:18.687
Why did l decide to leave surgery?
These last few months have been difficult,

07:18.772 --> 07:21.482
but l found a reserve of strength in myself
l didn't know l had,

07:21.566 --> 07:26.237
and l realized there are other ways
to heal people besides cutting them open.

07:27.364 --> 07:30.324
What experience
have you had with psychiatry?

07:30.575 --> 07:34.495
-That's kind of personal.
-Greg, remember what Steve said.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.289
This is a field about
the most intimate details in life.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.208
More intimate than their organs?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.460
You know, l'm curious
why you won't answer the question.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.088
What is your experience with psychiatry?

07:44.172 --> 07:46.966
None personally,
but my dad had a nervous breakdown.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.677
-l didn't know that.
-Yeah, no one was buying furniture.

07:49.761 --> 07:53.264
My mom ran away for two weeks
because he wouldn't get a Christmas tree.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.225
A headshrinker got him through,
but we weren't allowed to talk about it.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.227
Greg, that's wonderful.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.980
-lt was a lot of things, Joanie.
-No.

08:01.064 --> 08:04.150
Answer like that.
This is a talking profession.

08:04.234 --> 08:09.405
The way you just were with me right now,
so open, he's gonna love you.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.367
The most important thing
about an interview

08:13.451 --> 08:16.412
is to express enthusiasm
in a believable way.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.706
No self-deprecating humor.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.585
You're smart. You're funny.
You're great to be around,

08:22.752 --> 08:24.837
but you haven't decided
if they're the right one.

08:24.921 --> 08:29.341
-This isn't a beauty pageant.
-Well, l've seen executives crash and burn.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.225
l can't believe l never told you that.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.785
l just

08:58.872 --> 09:01.624
wanted more than l thought l would want.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.253
But it'll pass.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.966
Actually, l know for a fact it will.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.848
l don't want it to pass.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.483
One day l dropped the kids off at school
and l saw you in the yard.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.487
l kept wishing you could get in the car
and drive away with me.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.240
Just let it go.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.828
l'll clear my schedule. We can go to Mystic
or something for the rest of the week.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.039
Mystic?

09:47.087 --> 09:50.339
-l can think of someplace if you're serious.
-l am.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.385
Okay.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.812
Damn it.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.984
-Hello?
-Roger, it's Joan.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.653
-Joan Harris.
-Jesus.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.531
You're lucky l answered. Ginger's not in.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.742
l know. She has a hair appointment
the last Tuesday of every month.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.037
-She does?
-And I know that your lunch canceled.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.497
What am l wearing?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.043
So, how are things?

10:28.128 --> 10:31.880
Mr. Hooker has rearranged
the secretaries in the pool

10:32.132 --> 10:34.341
-alphabetically.
-By cup size?

10:34.718 --> 10:38.679
-Well, l know where you'd be sitting.
-You're making me sorry I called you.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.516
l need a favor. l need help finding work.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.436
-Something happen with Dr. Cut-Up?
-Not at all.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.730
He's pursuing his dream
of becoming a psychiatrist,

10:47.814 --> 10:51.650
but that means more training and l just
don't want him moonlighting all the time.

10:51.735 --> 10:55.112
-Why does it matter?
-lt doesn't. None of my business.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.699
-Why don't you come back here?
-Roger, l've been replaced,

10:58.783 --> 11:02.328
and a secretary makes less money
than if l was working at a department store.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.289
l'm so glad you called me.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.209
-l'm sorry it had to be for a favor.
-No.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.463
l like that you thought of me.
You know, to ask.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.967
You want to be on some people's minds.
Some people's you don't.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.929
-That's nice.
-So, do you miss it here?

11:21.264 --> 11:23.432
Are you asking if l miss you?

11:24.434 --> 11:27.603
Well, l guess l am,
because everything else is different.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.106
-l should go.
-Well, how do l work this?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.567
lf l think of anybody.
Just give them your number?

11:33.943 --> 11:36.862
Look at you,
figuring things out for yourself.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.283
Bye-bye, Joanie.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.792
Look who's here.

11:49.876 --> 11:53.670
l'm sorry l missed the funeral.
My grandson was graduating.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.547
lt was beautiful.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.716
Judy fixed lunch.
We don't have to talk right away.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.885
l don't have a lot of time.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.016
Betty wants to know
what the house is worth.

12:06.101 --> 12:09.895
-l'm a lawyer. l'm not a real estate agent.
-Well, the house was left to both of us,

12:09.979 --> 12:12.731
and l don't understand why l shouldn't
be able to buy it away from her

12:12.816 --> 12:15.818
-at double what Dad paid for it.
-They bought it in the late '20s.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.821
Dad always said
it was the top of the market.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.533
Your father intended you
to get as much money for it as you could,

12:22.617 --> 12:23.909
if you were going to sell it.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.912
Otherwise, somebody
has to buy somebody out.

12:26.996 --> 12:31.583
So, basically Dad gave it to Betty
because he knew l didn't have any money.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.044
This is ugly. You know that?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.846
Milton, l need to speak to you
in confidence.

12:57.694 --> 13:02.614
l need your advice.
l need complete confidentiality.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.243
lt's my husband.

13:07.871 --> 13:12.666
l just found out some compromising facts.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.631
He's been married before, and he...

13:21.718 --> 13:26.263
Well, it's not even his real name,
and he bought her a house, his ex-wife.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.559
l need to know what to do.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.062
l don't know him, Betsy.
l met him at your wedding.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.232
l know your father didn't want him
in the will.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.443
-So?
-What do you want to do?

13:39.694 --> 13:44.239
You want a divorce? ln New York state,
you need to prove adultery. Can you?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.994
-Maybe.
-l mean prove it in a court of law.

13:49.078 --> 13:54.166
That's hard to do. Unless he wants out,
but you're not gonna get anything.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.335
You won't even be able
to buy William out of the house.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.295
You'll have to sell it.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.465
And he can take the children.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.720
That's my legal advice.
You want the rest of it?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.685
-Are you afraid of him?
-No.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.438
ls he a good provider?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.943
He is, but that's not the point.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.947
lt's a lie so big, Milton.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.119
l feel like l've been in some dream
since l found out.

14:31.329 --> 14:35.707
Just saying it out loud to you...
This is the first time

14:37.418 --> 14:39.378
l'm realizing it's true.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.798
You have three small children together.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.052
At least go home, give it a try.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.182
That's what l'd tell my own daughter.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.811
Damn it, Betts! This isn't right!

15:03.987 --> 15:06.905
-Look, he waited.
-This is number three.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.868
What do you want?

15:11.953 --> 15:14.871
l'm going to have one of those lovely wines.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.001
Why did you have two? Are you nervous?

15:20.169 --> 15:23.380
-She'll have one of those lovely wines.
-Bordeaux.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.843
Don wants to call in
a focus group right away.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.013
That's enough business.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.933
l want to know everything that's happened
in the last 20 years.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.184
Longer.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.438
lt wasn't until years later that l realized

15:39.522 --> 15:43.108
you were the only person
l could remember that time with.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.361
What do you want to remember?

15:46.446 --> 15:50.032
What l was like at that age.
Paris before the war.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.035
Eating in cemeteries.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.707
People were jumping out of windows
and we were on vacation.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.667
l don't remember much.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.296
Are you trying to tell me
when you saw Casablanca

16:04.380 --> 16:07.591
-you didn't think about me?
-You mean Peter Lorre?

16:10.053 --> 16:14.097
You seemed so happy to see me,
and now you're just being drunk.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.893
Look, Annabelle.
We were not in Casablanca.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.522
The only similarity
is that you left me for another man.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.817
When she gets on the plane at the end?

16:25.902 --> 16:28.654
That woman got on the plane with a man
who was going to end World War ll,

16:28.738 --> 16:31.406
not run her father's dog food company.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.745
You were adrift.
You didn't do anything but spend money.

16:37.580 --> 16:41.625
You walked around like you were hoping
to be a character in somebody else's novel.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.085
The boxing.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.505
l'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your reasons.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.383
Believe it or not, l still remember them.

16:52.261 --> 16:56.390
Jesus, where's the wine?
l don't like the way you're looking at me.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.226
-How am l looking at you?
-With pity.

17:00.853 --> 17:05.440
l finally found a beautiful, carefree girl,
unconcerned about the future.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.527
-l was more serious than you.
-Well, l got mine.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.946
l married Mona, joined the firm,

17:11.114 --> 17:14.408
and then l got shipped off
to the Pacific for the duration.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.912
And when l came home, l went to work
while you were watching Casablanca,

17:19.956 --> 17:22.791
and l got blamed when we lost the account.

17:23.626 --> 17:27.212
All l heard was my father said
Bert Cooper had a screw loose.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.297
Look, you're rich.

17:29.966 --> 17:33.218
Let someone else take your horse meat
and slap their label on it.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.678
And do what?

17:38.099 --> 17:40.809
-l don't want a whole bottle.
-l'll help.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.734
And l told him
the closest we ever got to Hemingway

17:48.818 --> 17:54.698
was sitting in a chair he once sat in.
And that was the '20s, not the '30s.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.661
And then he said he remembered me
because l was the one

17:59.746 --> 18:02.456
-who'd introduced him to peanut butter.
-Yeah, l never understood that.

18:02.540 --> 18:06.126
They had peanuts in Europe.
No one ever thought of that?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.759
-Look at us.
-Will you stop?

18:17.054 --> 18:20.182
Roger, do l look like a widow?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.187
You look great.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.192
You still want me.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.944
So what?

18:34.489 --> 18:35.906
l'm married.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.075
Newlywed, honeymooning.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.873
How could l have missed the window
between Mona and her?

18:45.374 --> 18:48.001
There really wasn't much of a window.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.379
-Kind of overlapped.
-l was there first.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.592
We'll just take this and tack it onto that.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.386
l'm gonna get you a cab.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.474
Are you afraid l'll be disappointed?
You were always good drunk.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.393
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.981
lt's different with this girl.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.822
l'm sorry.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.327
Good night.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.090
How'd it go?

19:35.716 --> 19:39.052
l screwed up all my answers
and l tried to talk about the articles,

19:39.136 --> 19:42.973
but l couldn't remember anything.
l made a fool out of myself.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.601
-l am sure that's not true.
-You weren't there.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.271
Stop acting like you know everything.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.692
-You'll have other interviews.
-l don't want them.

19:53.776 --> 19:57.237
l don't want to be a psychiatrist.
lt's not medicine.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.782
l might as well work at a bank.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.787
l don't care what you do,
as long as you do something.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.581
We need money.

20:07.999 --> 20:11.918
l did everything l was supposed to do.
Everything they told me.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.379
College, med school.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.465
l wanted to be a surgeon
since l was that big.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.301
l'm sorry, Greg.

20:20.595 --> 20:23.513
-Maybe it's time to move on.
-You don't know!

20:23.639 --> 20:27.142
You don't know what it's like
to want something your whole life,

20:27.226 --> 20:30.896
and to plan for it,
and to count on it and not get it! Okay?

20:38.487 --> 20:39.821
Holy shit!

20:41.324 --> 20:44.826
What the hell?
You're insane, you know that?

20:57.632 --> 21:01.259
Why isn't he wearing a white coat?
He looks like a dog food salesman.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.969
Dogs don't like uniforms.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.264
Well, we're lucky.
Everyone has an appetite today.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.602
They said we should bring them hungry,
but he does seem to like this.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.521
How would you describe
your dog's temperament?

21:13.606 --> 21:17.567
She's picky, and she's nervous sometimes,

21:17.777 --> 21:20.695
-but she's very smart.
-And yours?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.907
He's independent, you know?

21:24.158 --> 21:27.327
He knows what he likes.
He's pretty hard to fool.

21:27.578 --> 21:31.539
-My God, they're describing themselves.
-This your first group?

21:32.375 --> 21:35.085
What if I told you your dogs
were enjoying Caldecott Farms?

21:35.169 --> 21:36.878
-What's it called?
-I wouldn't like it.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.547
-Bingo, stop.
-I've never heard of it.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.925
Well, you should.
They make it out of ponies.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.302
Goodness gracious, that's this one?

21:44.387 --> 21:47.389
This is the first I'm hearing of this.
I wish you would've told me.

21:47.473 --> 21:51.643
-When people are protesting, I'm onboard.
-Well, what brand does your dog prefer?

21:51.727 --> 21:54.479
-Why would you do this to us?
-It's inhumane.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.106
-Bingo looks sick.
-Turn it off.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.149
-Would you prefer beef...
-Could somebody get that?

21:58.234 --> 22:02.404
-l can't turn it off. lt's actually happening.
-Turn off the sound.

22:02.530 --> 22:06.324
l already know how people feel.
lt's yourjob to change that.

22:07.535 --> 22:11.079
Any agency that does not change the name
is stealing your money.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.498
The product is good.
lt's high quality, dogs love it,

22:13.582 --> 22:17.252
-but the name has been poisoned.
-That name got us where we are.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.339
-Do you think that was just luck?
-l'm not saying a new name is easy to find,

22:21.424 --> 22:25.427
and we will give you a lot of options,
but it's a label on a can.

22:26.637 --> 22:31.808
And it will be true, because it will promise
the quality of the product that's inside.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.769
Well, l'm gonna wait it out,

22:35.563 --> 22:38.023
and not for these morons,
but for another agency

22:38.107 --> 22:40.650
-to solve my problem.
-Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.

22:40.735 --> 22:44.320
The name is done. lt's unfair, but it's over.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.162
-Annabelle!
-Are you ready for the next group?

22:59.420 --> 23:03.131
-l don't like the way you're speaking to me.
-Everybody out.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.849
-ls this about last night?
-l don't even remember last night.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.811
Well, you threw yourself at me
and l turned you down.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.564
l'm right. You want to hurt me.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.025
No. No, l don't.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.238
You want to know if it was a great time?
lt was.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.410
Do you want to know
if you broke my heart? Obviously.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.122
Well, it was a mistake.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.127
lt's nice to hear,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.712
lt does to me.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.882
When l was burying this man,

23:45.966 --> 23:51.513
all l thought was, l'd have rather
had my heart broken every day by you.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.809
You were the one.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.354
You weren't.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.536
Well, you're lucky you found her.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.499
Goodbye, Roger.

24:27.591 --> 24:32.804
l think it's about four hours to Norwich,
but the Norwich lnn might be a little past it,

24:32.888 --> 24:36.057
and we can check in till midnight.
We'll be fine.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.322
l'll be right out.

25:11.385 --> 25:12.552
Daddy?

25:16.765 --> 25:19.434
-l'll be right back, Salamander.
-Daddy!

25:22.938 --> 25:25.648
-l left my hat in the car.
-Get it later.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.152
l need to talk to you.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.240
-Go upstairs.
-We want to say hi to Daddy.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.700
Upstairs.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.251
You're home early.
What did William do now?

25:45.336 --> 25:47.086
Not right now, Don.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.382
Why didn't you just call the office?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.593
l came home to feed the dog
and change shirts.

25:53.677 --> 25:57.805
-l have a client dinner in the city.
-l need to show you something.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.162
-What's going on?
-Open this drawer.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.291
Betts, that's my desk.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.088
Open the drawer or l will.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.342
Fine.

26:37.346 --> 26:40.014
Betty, this is my desk. lt's private.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.477
Where did you get these?

26:46.397 --> 26:49.357
You left them in the pocket
of your bathrobe,

26:51.110 --> 26:54.737
but l could have had a locksmith
in here anytime l wanted.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.492
l respected your privacy too long. Open it.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.538
No.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.084
You know l know what's in there.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.180
l can explain.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.479
You didn't have to look at my things.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.690
Which things, Don?

27:33.068 --> 27:36.154
The pictures covered
with other people's names?

27:37.990 --> 27:41.868
ls that you? Dick? ls that your name?

27:44.455 --> 27:46.873
People change their names, Betts.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.586
-You did.
-l did. l took your name.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.674
And so did this Anna woman,
whoever she is.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.346
-l can explain.
-l know. l know you can.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.766
You're a very, very gifted storyteller.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.227
Betts, l...

28:15.944 --> 28:17.487
l need a drink.

29:00.072 --> 29:04.325
Are you thinking of what to say
or are you just looking at that door?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.995
l'm not going anywhere.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.680
l'll get you a drink. Just sit down.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.129
You bought her a house.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.469
Where do you want me to start?

30:06.263 --> 30:09.056
-What's your name?
-Donald Draper.

30:12.728 --> 30:18.357
-But it used to be Dick Whitman.
-And who's that woman? Your other wife.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.820
lt wasn't romantic.

30:25.616 --> 30:29.452
l ended up married to her
because l ran away to join the army.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.090
There was an accident,

30:44.635 --> 30:47.470
and this guy was killed and l was injured.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.683
But they made a mistake.

30:55.729 --> 30:59.023
And all l had to do was be him
and l could leave Korea.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.274
Be who?

31:01.735 --> 31:04.946
-Donald Draper.
-You took his name?

31:07.115 --> 31:08.157
Yes.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.459
lsn't that against the law?

31:23.465 --> 31:24.549
Yes.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.597
l found out it was easier to be him

31:34.393 --> 31:36.143
than to start over.

31:37.688 --> 31:41.983
And it turned out he was married
to that woman, so l took care of her.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.113
And then l divorced her
the minute l met you.

31:47.197 --> 31:51.284
You divorced her on Valentine's Day, 1 953,

31:52.202 --> 31:56.122
three months before we got married.
Why didn't you tell me?

31:56.707 --> 32:00.501
-Why couldn't you tell me any of this?
-When? The day we met?

32:01.670 --> 32:04.380
On our first date? On our wedding night?

32:05.340 --> 32:09.260
-Why did you need to know?
-You don't get to ask any questions.

32:16.310 --> 32:17.977
You have a family.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.690
No, l don't.

32:26.486 --> 32:30.906
All this time l thought you were
some football hero who hated his father.

32:31.325 --> 32:34.952
l knew you were poor.
l knew you were ashamed of it.

32:36.371 --> 32:40.041
And l see how you are with money.
You don't understand it.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.377
l was very poor.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.841
Did you see her
when you were in California?

32:51.720 --> 32:52.887
l did.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.725
And she reminded me that l loved you.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.021
What would you do if you were me?

33:03.398 --> 33:07.234
-Would you love you?
-l was surprised that you ever loved me.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.072
Am l supposed to feel sorry for you?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.537
-l don't know.
-You obviously wanted me to know this

33:18.622 --> 33:23.668
or you wouldn't have left your keys, you
wouldn't have kept all of this in my house.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.214
Say something.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.429
l didn't think l had a choice.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.435
And l don't know what the difference is.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.438
This is our house.

33:46.108 --> 33:49.652
-Those are our children.
-Well, there's a big difference.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.780
You lied to me every day.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.412
l can't trust you. l don't know who you are.

34:01.415 --> 34:02.790
Yes, you do.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.342
We're not done.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.408
Betts, l'm in here.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.125
-How is he?
-He kicked his blankets off.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.132
Sit with me.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.786
This was my father, Archibald.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.082
But this...

36:09.167 --> 36:10.918
That's not my mother.

36:11.002 --> 36:15.923
My mother was a 22-year-old prostitute
who died having me.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.762
This woman,

36:23.265 --> 36:25.182
Abigail, Archie's wife.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.687
She raised me.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.940
When l was 1 0,

36:34.693 --> 36:37.278
Arch died and we moved.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.324
And Abigail

36:45.328 --> 36:46.954
took up with him.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.124
Mack.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.544
Uncle Mack.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.465
He was nice to me.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.763
What happened to them?

37:06.808 --> 37:08.434
They're all dead.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.146
Even Adam?

37:15.609 --> 37:20.487
The little boy in all the pictures.
l assume he's your brother.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.374
He was my half-brother.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.797
And he died.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.390
He killed himself.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.192
He came to me because he wanted help,

38:03.490 --> 38:05.366
and l turned him away.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.164
He didn't even want help, he just...

38:14.584 --> 38:17.294
He just wanted to be a part of my life.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.051
And l couldn't risk all of this.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.896
He hung himself.

38:43.405 --> 38:45.698
l'm sorry. l am.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.925
Bob, how are you?
Listen, l've got a favor to ask you.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.929
l know this girl. Actually, you met her once.

39:10.306 --> 39:13.976
Joan Holloway. Well, Harris. Redhead?

39:16.229 --> 39:18.147
Yes, she's beautiful.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.066
Anyway, she's expensive,
but you're always complaining

39:21.151 --> 39:24.153
about needing someone
to whip your place into shape,

39:24.237 --> 39:25.904
so think about it.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.951
l want to help her out.
She's important to me.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.873
Jane's fine. Thanks for asking.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.377
Don't be a stranger.

40:01.775 --> 40:03.442
l'm sorry, Joanie.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.822
And l'm gonna buy you another vase
to put those in.

40:08.907 --> 40:12.409
-l'm gonna buy you a lot of things.
-lt's not about buying things.

40:12.494 --> 40:15.120
l know, l know, but l've been an ass,

40:15.205 --> 40:18.540
feeling sorry for myself
because l couldn't solve this problem.

40:18.625 --> 40:22.586
And it was so easy, Joanie.
The answer was right in front of me.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.342
l joined the army, Joanie.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.762
You're gonna be taken care of.
We're gonna be taken care of.

40:31.846 --> 40:35.557
And the best part is, l get to be a surgeon.
They need them.

40:37.185 --> 40:40.729
-You joined the army?
-l know l should've asked you,

40:40.814 --> 40:43.190
but l'll do six weeks of basic training.
That's it.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.692
l'll do my residency in New York.

40:45.902 --> 40:49.446
-And then what?
-And then l might have to go somewhere.

40:49.531 --> 40:52.491
West Germany, maybe Vietnam,
if that's still going on,

40:52.575 --> 40:56.954
but a lot of docs don't have to go anywhere,
especially if they have families.

40:57.038 --> 41:00.499
And l'll go in as a captain.
You know what that means?

41:00.875 --> 41:03.210
You don't have to work anymore.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.881
-l don't know what to say.
-Joanie, please tell me

41:07.966 --> 41:10.634
this will make you happy,
because it will make me happy

41:10.718 --> 41:13.095
to give you everything you want.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.557
lt's wonderful, Greg.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.318
And no more soup.
Get your coat. We're going out.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.529
-We should.
-That's my girl.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.164
Do you want something?

43:06.709 --> 43:08.919
Are you gonna have something?

43:09.796 --> 43:13.340
-Daddy, are you going to trick or treat?
-Yes, of course.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.905
l'll see you tonight.

43:40.159 --> 43:43.078
-l didn't think you were coming in today.
-l canceled my plans.

43:43.162 --> 43:47.207
Do you want me to reschedule your lunch
with Jeff Stansbury at United Fruit?

43:47.292 --> 43:49.251
No, l have plenty to do.

43:59.429 --> 44:01.680
-Hello?
-l stopped by earlier.

44:01.889 --> 44:04.850
-No one answered.
-l was running all morning.

44:06.936 --> 44:10.480
-About last night...
-What happened? Did you get caught?

44:16.946 --> 44:19.281
lt's more complicated than that.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.911
So, l suppose l'm not going
to see you anymore?

44:27.123 --> 44:30.208
Not right now. No.

44:37.467 --> 44:38.925
Are you okay?

44:41.262 --> 44:43.930
Only you would ask about me right now.

44:46.601 --> 44:48.935
Do l have to worry about my job?

44:50.605 --> 44:51.646
No.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.484
Okay.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.780
l should go.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.115
Goodbye.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.660
Goodbye, Suzanne.

45:15.546 --> 45:18.632
-He's home! Let's go!
-You'll wake the baby.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.976
-Do l look like a gypsy?
-Yes.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.313
Let's go, let's go!

45:36.692 --> 45:38.860
-Do you want anything?
-No.

45:39.821 --> 45:41.780
Should l take the carriage orjust carry him?

45:41.864 --> 45:43.657
lt's cold out there.

45:44.325 --> 45:47.119
You can stay here with him or l can.

45:49.539 --> 45:50.580
No.

45:53.543 --> 45:54.668
Good.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.380
What's taking so long?

46:17.024 --> 46:19.359
-Trick or treat!
-Trick or treat!

46:19.902 --> 46:21.987
Well, hello there. Look at this.

46:22.071 --> 46:25.574
We've got a gypsy and a hobo.

46:27.869 --> 46:30.203
And who are you supposed to be?
