[theme music]

00:46.114 --> 00:49.483
[roseanne laughs]

00:49.583 --> 00:52.953
[music playing]

00:56.124 --> 00:56.990
What's this?

00:57.091 --> 00:59.160
My insurance claim
for the robbery.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.430
27-inch color TV
with stereo and remote?

01:02.530 --> 01:04.064
Yeah, so?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.966
Hey, the only thing those
crooks ripped off from

01:06.066 --> 01:08.369
your apartment was a 12-inch
portable, black and white

01:08.469 --> 01:10.671
with a hanger for an antenna.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.006
That Philco was an heirloom.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.343
You just can't put a
price on sentiment.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.244
Well you did.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.879
750 bucks.

01:18.979 --> 01:21.115
Well, those punks
trashed my apartment.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.383
I'm only trying
to get back what's

01:22.483 --> 01:25.953
mine plus a little compensation
for my mental anguish.

01:26.053 --> 01:26.887
Your mental anguish?

01:26.987 --> 01:27.788
What about me?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.190
I've been married for 15 years.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.395
So you think the
insurance company

01:34.495 --> 01:35.429
is not going to go for it?

01:35.529 --> 01:36.830
I don't know.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.369
A multinational conglomerate--
outwit the Lanford scam queen?

01:41.469 --> 01:44.772
[speaking french]
[music playing on tv] Becky,

01:44.872 --> 01:47.441
turn down that heavy breathing.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.943
Mom, Darlene has been taking
my stuff again without asking.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.612
I have not.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.647
Then how come I found my
new sweater at the bottom

01:53.747 --> 01:55.249
of your grungy closet?

01:55.349 --> 01:57.551
Because everything in the
free world is at the bottom

01:57.651 --> 01:59.320
of that grungy closet.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.821
So what else is new?

02:00.921 --> 02:03.056
Mom, this is the sweater I
was going to wear to Diane's

02:03.157 --> 02:04.192
tonight to do homework.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.894
Since when do they got
a dress code at Diane's?

02:06.994 --> 02:09.663
Yeah, bosom face.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.501
Can't we have
her put to sleep?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.703
Well, we tried but
the vet backed out.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.007
What you doing, Aunt Jackie?

02:20.107 --> 02:23.444
What she does best-- trying
to get something for nothing.

02:23.544 --> 02:27.080
Mom, I can't get the knob
to turn on this stupid washer.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.216
I hate this house!

02:28.316 --> 02:29.483
Nothing ever works!

02:29.583 --> 02:31.785
Except me.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.787
Hey, put me down for a
new washer, would ya?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.959
Here, dig in.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.761
This stuff is disgusting.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.129
Wait 'till you taste it.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.167
June, I'm home.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.870
You'll never know how
I've counted the hours.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.339
On your toes, right?

02:51.439 --> 02:52.273
See ya.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.874
Always nice to
see ya-- leaving.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.378
I'm coming right back
so don't get too excited.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.747
Roseanne, you need anything
besides breadcrumbs?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.515
Yeah, pick me up a
couple of those tabloids

03:01.615 --> 03:02.916
so I can keep tabs on Elvis.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.155
Fork over the bread, Fred.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.824
Don't hurry back, Jack.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.593
Thanks for the cash, stupid.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.168
Hi, The Beckster.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.536
Hi, The Dadster.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.838
Can you drop me off
at Diane's tonight?

03:24.938 --> 03:26.674
Hmm, for a price.

03:26.774 --> 03:27.708
Thanks.

03:27.808 --> 03:28.609
Not now, Dan.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.811
Not in front of the kids.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.713
I gotta get out of this shirt.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.648
Mercury must have
shot up 30 degrees

03:34.748 --> 03:36.116
while I was driving home.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
Well, your mercury
always shoots

03:37.818 --> 03:39.353
the closer you get to me.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.254
Come on out here.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.289
I want to show you this sky.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.126
I was on the job site,
the clouds started

03:46.226 --> 03:48.629
spreading out like India ink.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.300
Kind of like "Close Encounters."

03:52.400 --> 03:54.167
Oh man, look at that
that cumulonimbus.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.738
Well, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.740
That little baby gets
the vertical updraft going,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.775
you know we're in for.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.378
Lots of little nimbuses?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.279
Ah!

04:05.379 --> 04:07.815
This weather gets my fur up!

04:07.915 --> 04:09.883
Take a deep breath.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.719
You know what that smells like?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.321
What's the word I'm looking for?

04:13.421 --> 04:16.156
Garbage.

04:16.256 --> 04:20.260
Ah, there's nothing like
the air before a storm--

04:20.361 --> 04:21.629
so stimulating.

04:21.729 --> 04:26.133
Yeah, I feel the
same way about laundry.

04:26.233 --> 04:30.003
Hey, partner, I was just
about to send out a posse.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.472
Funny, Mom.

04:31.572 --> 04:35.275
Oh good, I see you
put your bike away.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.278
Mom, why is it so hot?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.548
I don't know, honey, I
think we're due for a storm.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.717
[thunder crashes]

04:43.817 --> 04:45.085
God, that was close.

04:45.185 --> 04:49.457
I got static electricity-- the
hair is standing up my arms!

04:49.557 --> 04:50.858
This is so cool!

04:50.958 --> 04:52.726
Are we gonna have a hurricane?

04:52.826 --> 04:55.929
No, baby, we don't get
hurricanes this far inland.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.399
Yeah, those coastal
towns have all the fun.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.368
Come on, let's put up the bikes.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.308
I'm gonna go check
the weather report!

05:08.409 --> 05:12.780
[inaudible]

05:12.880 --> 05:14.281
What was that?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.750
That was God saying
get your butt inside!

05:20.320 --> 05:21.922
Dad, what are you doing?

05:22.022 --> 05:25.726
He's trying to find some
music he can relate to.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.794
MAN (ON RADIO): As at 5:00 p.m.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.029
Central Standard Time,
a tornado watch is

05:29.129 --> 05:30.498
in effect for Fulton County--

05:30.598 --> 05:31.965
- Hey, that's us!
- Shh!

05:32.065 --> 05:33.667
MAN (ON RADIO): A storm is
on the southern boundary

05:33.767 --> 05:35.869
of the county and there is
a threat of larger funnels--

05:35.969 --> 05:37.037
Tornado, I knew it.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.439
Boy, you know, the
next thing they're

05:38.539 --> 05:40.908
going to be urging us to take
adequate and immediate shelter.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.476
MAN (ON RADIO): All

strongly urged to take

05:44.578 --> 05:47.280
adequate and immediate shelter.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.349
There is a tornado
watch in effect

05:49.450 --> 05:50.884
for all of Fulton County.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.786
That is a tornado watch.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.523
OK, everybody duck and cover.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.725
A tornado, cool!

05:57.825 --> 05:59.427
Shut up, Darlene,
this is serious.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.961
What's a tornado?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.930
Well, remember that
part in "Wizard of Oz"

06:03.030 --> 06:04.932
when Dorothy was all
alone in the house

06:05.032 --> 06:07.234
and she went flying up in
the air and spinning around.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.205
Is our house gonna
go spinning around?

06:12.305 --> 06:15.909
DJ, you know that stuff
you see on television that--

06:16.009 --> 06:17.811
that just gives you a
sense of what's real.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.047
What's going to happen
today is really real.

06:20.147 --> 06:24.117
A tornado is raw,
wild, untamed--

06:24.217 --> 06:25.519
what's the word I'm looking for?

06:25.619 --> 06:26.420
George Bush?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.258
Aren't we supposed
be doing something?

06:31.358 --> 06:32.893
Well, what's the
worst that can happen?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.862
OK, the tornado
picks up our house

06:34.962 --> 06:37.097
and slams it down in
a better neighborhood.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.236
Mother, this is no
time to kid around.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.137
Yeah, you're right.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.274
OK, everybody panic!

06:47.374 --> 06:48.175
I'm serious!

06:48.275 --> 06:49.477
We had a tornado
drill in school.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.844
We're supposed to
go to the northeast

06:50.944 --> 06:52.179
corner of the basement.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.514
Well, we don't have a basement
anymore because your dad's

06:53.614 --> 06:55.282
using it for a storage locker.

06:55.382 --> 06:58.051
Well, I had to put them two by
fours and sheet rock somewhere.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.520
Then what are we going to do?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.689
Well, we're going to get all
our disaster supplies together

07:01.789 --> 07:03.591
so we can sit down and
enjoy this like a family.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.492
DAN: OK.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.026
What supplies?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.228
You know, like,
candles, matches,

07:08.328 --> 07:09.597
batteries, stuff like that.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.799
First aid kit-- where's
our first aid kit?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.467
It's not a first
aid kit any more.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.768
Darlene's been using
it as a lunchbox.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.174
What happened to the
stuff that was inside it?

07:21.274 --> 07:25.312
Well, I, uh, sort of sold
it to the, uh, baseball team.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.916
Good, at least they're safe.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.283
What about food?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.284
Good idea, DJ.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.287
Food, uh, canned
goods, uh, fresh water.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.789
Now, Dan, this
is an emergency we

07:35.889 --> 07:40.093
need real food like caramel
corn and cheese puffs.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.630
I'm gonna call Freddie and
Beatrice, see if we can use

07:42.730 --> 07:44.464
their cellar as a storm cellar.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.700
I thought we agreed
to see less of them.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.569
Honey, this is a disaster.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.971
So was their last party.

07:51.071 --> 07:51.872
Ah!

07:51.972 --> 07:53.707
Damn!

07:53.807 --> 07:55.075
I can't get through.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.710
I shouldn't even be on the phone
with the lightning so close.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.078
[thunder crash]

07:58.178 --> 07:59.446
But I gotta call Diane and
tell her I can't come tonight.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.814
Well, you can
tell her later when

08:00.914 --> 08:04.718
her house flies by our window.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.053
Would you stop
screwing around?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.888
Oh right, Dan,
let's whip the kids up

08:07.988 --> 08:10.758
into a hysterical frenzy
while there's still time.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.359
We're talk about
a tornado here.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.293
An honest to God tornado.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.628
Well, don't you
think I'm worried?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.630
My sister is out there,
for crying out loud.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.631
I know you're worried.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.966
We're supposed to
unplug everything.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.934
Right, and crack the windows
a little bit so the pressure

08:21.034 --> 08:22.703
doesn't build up in here.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.972
[thunder crashing]

08:25.072 --> 08:26.439
I put new batteries
in the radio

08:26.540 --> 08:29.509
but I can't get a station.

08:29.610 --> 08:33.146
OK, we're losing power.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.481

08:52.332 --> 08:54.201
Shut up, Darlene!

08:54.301 --> 08:55.636
You're scaring DJ.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.904
No way!

into our tornado gear!

09:01.174 --> 09:02.843
Becky, turn off the washer.

09:02.943 --> 09:07.247
Make sure it's off and
unplug it, and the dryer too.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.116
Dan, I'm scared.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.317
I'm scared about Jackie.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.252
I'm scared about everything.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.689
It'll be OK.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.558
Oh, thank God you always
know the right thing to say.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.461
[wind howling]

09:21.561 --> 09:23.330
[knocking on door]

09:23.430 --> 09:24.865
Who would be out in
the middle of a tornado?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.867
You mean besides your Father?

09:26.967 --> 09:27.868
CRYSTAL: It's me, Crystal!

09:32.906 --> 09:35.075
I was on my way home
from taking Lonnie

09:35.175 --> 09:36.276
down state to his
grandma's and I

09:36.376 --> 09:38.979
almost lost control of the car.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.548
It's like the end of
the world out there.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.785
Great, no more "Geraldo."

09:44.885 --> 09:45.719
Let me take your coat.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.020
No, no, I prefer
to keep it on.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.222
You never know, the wind
might rip the roof off.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.123
That's the way!

09:50.223 --> 09:52.359
Think positive!

09:52.459 --> 09:53.827
[banging sounds]

09:53.927 --> 09:55.128
Lord, have mercy.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.964
Come on, Crystal, why
don't you sit down and relax.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.465
I can't relax.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.901
All right, then
clean my house.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.335
Have you ever been
in a tornado, Dad?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.704
Yeah.
Whoa, stand over here.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.773
Yeah.
Stand where it's safe.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.041
Wow, did you see
that tire blow by?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.176
I did!

10:09.276 --> 10:10.644
Yeah, you kids are
getting a taste of what

10:10.744 --> 10:12.112
mother nature really can do.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.647
You're also about
to get a taste

10:13.747 --> 10:16.483
of that plate glass window.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.386
What good is a tornado
If you can't see it?

10:19.486 --> 10:20.587
Oh Yeah, you're right.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.957
Why don't you guys
go out and play.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.226
Dan, you're not safe there.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.828
So damn hypnotic.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.363
I can't believe Jackie
is still out there.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.900
There are live electrical
wires down all over town.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.535
Oh, for God's sake, Crystal.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.037
Roseanne!

10:37.137 --> 10:39.539
We gotta take cover
it's coming this way.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.507
[crashing sounds]

10:40.607 --> 10:42.509
[screaming]

10:42.609 --> 10:45.512
[thunder crashing]

10:45.612 --> 10:49.016
[music playing]

10:51.618 --> 10:53.754
ROSEANNE: Whoa, who
did I just step on?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.255
DJ: Me!

10:55.355 --> 10:57.925
ROSEANNE: That's one.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.559
Darlene?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.394
DAN: Darlene?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.163
CRYSTAL: Oh my
god, where is she?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.364
Blaaaaa!

11:04.464 --> 11:05.465
ROSEANNE: That is not funny!

11:05.565 --> 11:09.369
You're grounded until menopause!

11:09.469 --> 11:12.806
Yours or mine?

11:12.906 --> 11:13.807
ROSEANNE: Your father's.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.011
Becky?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.813
Becky, come out now!

11:19.913 --> 11:22.983
It wasn't funny
when Darlene did it.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.417
JACKIE: Becky!

11:24.517 --> 11:26.186
Maybe she's lying
in the house somewhere

11:26.286 --> 11:27.420
buried under the rubble.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.889
Knock it off!

11:34.928 --> 11:35.796
[screams]

11:35.896 --> 11:36.696
What is it?

11:36.797 --> 11:37.931
Nothing.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.770
I just bumped into my
future and it was hideous.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.637
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.139
No, Jackie went
to check up there.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.174
You know she went.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.108
The garage?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.810
Yeah, to get
those damn animals.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.311
Let's go get her and
beat the hell out of her

11:51.411 --> 11:52.946
before the tornado gets her.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.118
Becky, what the hell
were you thinking about?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.652
You could have been killed!

11:59.753 --> 12:02.990
So could Pebbles and Bam-Bam.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.892
I got to go get Waffles
he needs his medicine.

12:04.992 --> 12:05.959
Hey!

12:06.059 --> 12:07.660
I don't care if Pancakes
needs a pacemaker

12:07.761 --> 12:09.696
you're not going no place.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.065
Now grab those rats, we're
going into the living room.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.508
Rosie, this is
really something.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.476
If I knew I wasn't going
to get killed I'd get right

12:23.576 --> 12:24.377
out in the middle of this.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.278
This is too good to miss.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.780
Well, so are you.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.216
What difference does it make
if he goes out or stays in?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.718
If a tornado is going to get
you it's going to get you.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.954
When your number is
up your number is up.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.156
We've all got to go sometime.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.927
Try not to look
on the bright side.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.063
Don't talk about
this, it's bad luck.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.866
Bad luck, good luck, what
difference does it make?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.567
We're powerless.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.502
When I was on my way back
over here I saw that thing.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.437
The tornado?

12:50.537 --> 12:51.604
Yeah, and I had
my camera with me

12:51.704 --> 12:53.473
so I thought I'd move
in on it and snap a few.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.942
How could you do
something that crazy?

12:55.042 --> 12:57.044
Well, Dad used to
put us all in a Buick

12:57.144 --> 12:58.678
and go chasing storms
whenever he had the chance.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.548
Well, Dad was a lunatic!

13:01.648 --> 13:03.216
You can't believe the
power of that thing.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.785
It wipes out one house it
leaves the next one untouched.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.121
There's absolutely no
rhyme or reason to it.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.189
It's beyond our control.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.358
Nothing means anything!

13:11.458 --> 13:12.492
Have you been talking to Mom?

13:15.162 --> 13:18.665
Come on, you two, you're
missing out on marshmallows.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.601
Come on, sis, marshmallows--
food of the gods--

13:21.701 --> 13:25.205
we'll have a regular oink-fest.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.608
Roseanne, how
do you like yours?

13:28.708 --> 13:30.210
How do you like yours, Roseanne?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.480
Oh, like I like my men,
crispy on the outside

13:33.580 --> 13:37.417
and stuck to the end of a fork.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.719
Want me to make
you one, Aunt Jackie?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.621
Don't bother your
Aunt Jackie when she's

13:41.721 --> 13:43.456
in the middle of a break down.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.391
[loud bang]

13:44.491 --> 13:45.859
Oh my God, what's at the door?

13:48.728 --> 13:53.566
It's for you, Crystal

13:53.666 --> 13:55.068
CRYSTAL: Give me the willies.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.169
Are you OK?

13:56.269 --> 13:59.239
Yeah, I'm writing
in my diary everything

13:59.339 --> 14:02.342
that is happening just in case.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.977
Oh, honey, you're
going to make it.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.578
You'll survive this
horrible moment

14:05.678 --> 14:09.649
and grow up and have horrible
moments with your own kids.

14:09.749 --> 14:10.717
Love you, Mom.

14:10.817 --> 14:11.618
[metal scraping]

14:11.718 --> 14:13.020
What was that?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.787
Probably something of mine.

14:14.888 --> 14:15.956
[banging]

14:16.056 --> 14:19.726
Roseanne, I want to live.

14:19.826 --> 14:20.961
Think it over.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.896
Roseanne.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.132
Oh, God.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.333
God, if you get me
through this I'll

14:26.433 --> 14:28.301
forget all about
the 27-inch color TV

14:28.401 --> 14:29.869
with stereo and remote.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.504
You should see that
twister, it's unbelievable!

14:31.604 --> 14:32.639
Here we go, come
on get over here.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.840
Let's go, move it.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.342
Move it!

14:35.442 --> 14:37.344
[banging]

14:37.444 --> 14:39.412
I just want you all to know
that I love you very much.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.313
What?

14:40.413 --> 14:41.314
I love you!

14:41.414 --> 14:43.917
We love you too, now shut up!

14:44.017 --> 14:44.817
It's coming!

14:44.918 --> 14:46.319
It's coming!

14:46.419 --> 14:49.322
DJ, get away from that window!

14:49.422 --> 14:51.291
[glass breaking]

14:51.391 --> 14:53.293
[wind howling]

14:53.393 --> 14:56.796
[music playing]

15:05.939 --> 15:08.608
OK, everybody look horrified.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.412
Well, it will be hard
to top my wedding photo.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.813
You'll thank me for these.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.515
These are for your
insurance company.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.050
- Mom?
- Watch the glass.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.518
Can Darlene and
I go and see what's

15:18.618 --> 15:19.886
left of the neighborhood.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.689
Yeah, be careful where you
walk though, and no looting--

15:22.789 --> 15:25.358
unless it fits me.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.593
I'll go with them, Roseanne.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.195
I could use a
breath of fresh air.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.629
Come on, girls.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.998
Can I go too, Mom?

15:31.098 --> 15:32.532
No, you have stay here.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.667
I'm not done hugging you yet.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.003
You believe this?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.637
Freddy sunk this baby in a
foot of concrete and the wind

15:37.737 --> 15:38.838
still got it.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.807
Good, I always hated
that stupid goose

15:40.907 --> 15:43.910
and gander painted on the side.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.146
Honk!

15:46.246 --> 15:47.647
I'm gonna take it out
back and see if we still

15:47.747 --> 15:49.249
got anything left out there.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.150
Can I help?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.684
Absolutely not.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.786
- Please, I'll be careful.
- Oh, OK.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.626
The perfect end to
another perfect day, eh sis?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.261
Yeah, and of course
you didn't help things

16:01.361 --> 16:03.830
out any running around out
there like a fool and making me

16:03.930 --> 16:04.764
worry about you.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.133
I wasn't trying
to make you worry.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.934
I just thought I might be able
to sell some of these shots

16:08.035 --> 16:09.002
to a magazine.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.204
Sometimes I feel
like I got four kids.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.339
Oh, lighten up.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.841
It was just a little tornado.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.944
Well, you don't get it, do ya?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.579
You really scared me.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.281
I wasn't trying to scare you.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.785
You don't have to try,
your whole life scares me.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.854
Look what we found,
your lawn chairs

16:27.954 --> 16:30.190
were over on Glenden Avenue.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.326
Our stuff was lying all
over the neighborhood.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.827
What'd you bring it back for?

16:34.927 --> 16:38.131
This was my big chance
to get rid of it.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.633
Mom, is it safe to watch TV?

16:40.733 --> 16:44.003
No safer than before.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.806
Hey, this doesn't
belong to us, does it?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.841
No, but it could if you
play your cards right.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.983
Guess it must have blown
over from Freddie's yard.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.985
Well here's our chance to
get even with him for not

16:59.086 --> 17:01.754
returning your weed whacker.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.889
You'll be happy
to know we still

17:02.989 --> 17:04.457
got a back end on the place.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.658
Well I'm just
glad that we still

17:05.758 --> 17:08.261
got back ends on each other.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.130
Well, I guess I'll
get over to my place

17:10.230 --> 17:11.664
and see if it's still standing.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.166
Thanks for putting up with me.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.367
Sure.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.869
Just don't press your
luck in future disasters.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.837
See ya.

17:17.937 --> 17:18.405
Bye bye, you
guys, see you later.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.172
DAN: Bye, Crys.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.140
BECKY: Bye.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.408
Well, I feel like celebrating.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.675
Who will Join me in a beer?

17:22.775 --> 17:23.810
Me!

17:23.910 --> 17:27.314
Shh, shh, shh, I think
that's Cypress street.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.716
REPORTER (ON TV): John
Hale, where the action is,

17:29.816 --> 17:30.917
at the scene.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.220
As we all know by now,
several small tornadoes

17:33.320 --> 17:35.888
have caused extensive damage
to parts of the Lanford area.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.957
Although they lasted
less than half an hour,

17:38.057 --> 17:41.461
the tornado's-- gusting
up to 150 miles per hour--

17:41.561 --> 17:46.099
brought near devastation to
several homes and businesses.

17:46.199 --> 17:50.337
The house behind me, located
at 344 Cypress well--

17:50.437 --> 17:51.571
[siren sounds]

17:51.671 --> 17:55.942
We saw two ambulances going
around the block before.

17:56.042 --> 17:56.943
Jeez, Dan.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.446
I don't even want
to think about it.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.747
You want to think
about salvaging

18:00.847 --> 18:02.349
what's left of our backyard?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.751
I don't want to think
about that either.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.153
Looks like we lucked
out again, huh kid?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.087
REPORTER (ON TV): --extent of
the damage to the Rocker home.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.222
Yeah.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.424
Well, think about it,
if you were a tornado

18:11.524 --> 18:12.825
would you want to
come in this house?

18:18.298 --> 18:19.599
What is that, one
of them zen riddles?

18:30.543 --> 18:31.644
Let me ask you a question.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.814
That depends, what about?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.916
About Freddie's mailbox.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.186
Freddie's mailbox--
ask me anything you

18:39.286 --> 18:41.388
want about Freddie's mailbox.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.890
What if it would have hit
me in the head and killed me?

18:47.394 --> 18:50.697
[laughing]

18:50.797 --> 18:51.731
What do you mean?

18:51.831 --> 18:52.632
W-what do you mean?

18:52.732 --> 18:53.500
What if it would
have killed you?

18:53.600 --> 18:54.401
What then?

18:54.501 --> 18:55.335
What?

18:55.435 --> 18:58.205
I mean, Roseanne
Conner, 35, was

18:58.305 --> 19:00.807
killed in yesterday's
tornado by Freddie

19:00.907 --> 19:03.042
Meeker's flying mailbox.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.812
Dan Conner, 36, today
filed suit in civil court

19:05.912 --> 19:10.850
against one Frederick Meeker for
an amount exceeding $5 million.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.521
Seriously though, what
would you have done?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.088
Roseanne, there's
a time for morbid

19:16.189 --> 19:18.157
and there's a time
for not morbid.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.293
Check your watch.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.795
I'm just asking you
a serious question.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.996
What would you have done?

19:24.096 --> 19:25.498
A single father, three kids.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.803
Probably go out and look
for Florence Henderson.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.179
Come on, Dan,
this is something

19:40.280 --> 19:42.048
we really have to think about.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.250
No we don't.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.017
Why not?

19:45.117 --> 19:47.820
Because nothing bad
is ever gonna happen.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.556
Oh, right.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.859
Roseanne Conner celebrated
yet another birthday

19:52.959 --> 19:56.829
today-- she was 264 years old.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.932
Look, Honey, we don't have
to talk about this right now.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.034
We ought to just be glad we're
alive, the kids are alive,

20:02.134 --> 20:04.804
[knocks on wood]
let it go at that.

20:04.904 --> 20:05.838
Let it go at that?

20:05.938 --> 20:06.739
Yup.

20:06.839 --> 20:10.009
Dan, that tornado was a sign.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.244
What kind of a sign?

20:11.344 --> 20:12.479
A giant sign.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.080
No, like a giant poster.

20:14.180 --> 20:17.650
More like a billboard and in
great, big letters it says--

20:17.750 --> 20:19.586
Repent the end is near?

20:19.686 --> 20:22.188
No, it says,
sorry we missed you

20:22.289 --> 20:24.190
we'll call again for
another appointment,

20:24.291 --> 20:25.758
and it's signed The Tornado Man.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.062
Terrific.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.832
OK, we'll live our lives
and every other moment

20:32.932 --> 20:34.401
of every other day
we'll look at each other

20:34.501 --> 20:37.804
and go, watch out, babe,
something bad is gonna happen.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.672
Well, that's a
wonderful prescription

20:39.772 --> 20:41.107
for a relaxed life.

20:41.207 --> 20:46.946
Rosie, there are some things
you can't prepare for, ever.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.582
Uh, no matter how much you
think you're prepared for them

20:49.682 --> 20:51.117
you're not prepared.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.819
And if you spend your whole
life preparing for them

20:52.919 --> 20:55.021
you're wasting your time.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.256
Hell, I know that.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.691
Well, what's this all about?

21:01.594 --> 21:05.332
Well, I guess there's
just a warm front moving in.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.335
[music plays]

21:08.435 --> 21:09.802
I guess you're right.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.144
[phone ringing]

21:18.244 --> 21:19.078
DJ: I'll get it!

21:19.178 --> 21:21.781
DARLENE: You can't
even reach it.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.215
Hello?

21:23.316 --> 21:25.918
Yeah, Hi Mrs. Clyde.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.688
Yeah, I'll tell him.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.723
Dad, that was Mrs. Clyde.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.625
She's got your Chicago
Bears boxer shorts.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.365
They were in her tree.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.899
And to think I trust you!

21:42.969 --> 21:46.639
Hehe, baby, I was thinking
about you the whole time.

21:46.739 --> 21:49.709
