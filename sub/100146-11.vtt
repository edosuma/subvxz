WEBVTT

00:10.620 --> 00:12.410
OLIVIA?

00:15.240 --> 00:17.540
OLIVIA? OLIVIA, I'M
GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU

00:17.540 --> 00:19.580
TO WAIT FOR YOUR FRIEND
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.170
HIS NAME IS SPENCER,
AND I CAN'T LEAVE HIM.
HE NEEDS ME.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.960
DOCTOR: OLIVIA, WE BOTH
WANT THE SAME THING,

00:22.960 --> 00:25.590
BUT I CANNOT ASSESS
SPENCER'S WOUNDS
UNTIL YOU LET US GO.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.260
-NO! NO! SPENCER!
-OLIVIA?

00:27.260 --> 00:28.630
YOU NEED TO GET YOUR LEFT
WRIST CHECKED OUT IN TRIAGE.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.630
THIS WAY.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.720
OLIVIA?!

00:30.720 --> 00:32.180
GET MY PATIENT AN ICU CODE.

00:32.180 --> 00:34.510
THE HOSPITAL'S OFFICIALLY
ON LOCKDOWN.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.520
WHAT'S AN ICU CODE?
WHY IS THE HOSPITAL
ON LOCKDOWN?

00:36.520 --> 00:38.270
THE HOSPITAL HAS
A LOCKDOWN PROCEDURE

00:38.270 --> 00:40.060
ANYTIME A MINOR IS ADMITTED

00:40.060 --> 00:41.650
WITH A GANG-RELATED
VIOLENT INJURY.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.150
WAIT. SO I
CAN'T SEE HIM?

00:43.150 --> 00:45.650
NOT UNTIL THE THREAT
HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.

00:45.650 --> 00:50.110
SORRY. THE LOCKDOWN
REALLY IS FOR
THE PATIENT'S OWN SAFETY.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.370
A LOT OF TIMES, RIVAL
GANG MEMBERS WILL TRY

00:52.370 --> 00:54.410
AND FINISH THE JOB
IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.910
THIS WAY, SWEETIE.

00:58.910 --> 01:00.750
OH, NO.

01:06.710 --> 01:08.550
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

01:08.550 --> 01:11.180
YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.220
HIS LUNGS ARE CLEAR.

01:12.220 --> 01:14.220
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS
AGAIN.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.390
I NEED 2 MILLIGRAMS
OF DILAUDID TO BRING
DOWN HIS PAIN, PLEASE.

01:16.390 --> 01:18.560
-WAITING ON THE TOX SCREEN.
-WHO ORDERED THAT?

01:18.560 --> 01:20.690
EVERET WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT HE'S ON BEFORE WE
GIVE HIM ANYTHING ELSE.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.600
-WHAT HE'S ON? FOR WHAT?
-WHERE ARE WE?

01:22.600 --> 01:25.560
-HIS LUNGS ARE GOOD.
-BP IS 56 OVER PALP BUT STEADY.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.150
EVERET: STILL LOW.
GIVE ME AN EKG.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.980
I WANT TO KNOW
THE SECOND IT DIPS.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.740
I CAN'T RULE OUT
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

01:30.740 --> 01:33.530
TILL WE KNOW WHAT
PATH THE BULLET TOOK.

01:33.530 --> 01:35.410
CAN YOU GET ME
MORE HANDS IN HERE?
I WANT THIS CLEANED STAT.

01:35.410 --> 01:37.540
I CAN'T SEE
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.910
I'M IN TRAUMA 2.
GRAB ME WHEN THAT
SHOULDER'S CLEANED UP.

01:38.910 --> 01:41.040
BUT, EVERET, I THINK
THAT HE NEEDS--

01:41.040 --> 01:44.420
ALL RIGHT. EVERET WILL
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.170
MAN: HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW
THE VICTIM?

01:46.170 --> 01:47.800
HIS NAME IS SPENCER,
SPENCER JAMES.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.670
AND HE'S A FRIEND
OF MINE.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.130
WAS HE INVOLVED IN
A GANG DISPUTE?

01:51.130 --> 01:52.590
NO. SPENCER COULD
NEVER BE IN A GANG.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.970
HE COULD NEVER HURT
ANYONE.

01:53.970 --> 01:56.720
THEN HOW DID YOU HURT
YOUR WRIST?

01:56.720 --> 01:58.600
NURSE: I'M SORRY, HON.
I'M SORRY.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.770
-GOD.
-HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

02:01.770 --> 02:03.770
SCARY HOW GANG
VIOLENCE IS GETTING

02:03.770 --> 02:05.770
CLOSER AND CLOSER
TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:05.770 --> 02:08.230
WE CAN DO WITHOUT
THE EDITORIAL.

02:08.230 --> 02:10.400
I'LL PUSH
THE SALINE.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.780
AND 4 BAGS O-NEG.
I NEED THAT RIGHT
AWAY, PLEASE.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.240
-HOLD ON THAT.
-WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

02:15.240 --> 02:16.820
HIS CURRENT BLOOD TYPE.
O-NEG DOESN'T FLOW
FROM ROCKS.

02:16.820 --> 02:17.830
EVERET: HOW'S HE DOING?

02:17.830 --> 02:19.830
HE NEEDS
A TRANSFUSION.

02:19.830 --> 02:21.830
WE CAN PUSH
O-NEG AND DO
A CROSS AND TYPE

02:21.830 --> 02:23.000
AFTER WE GET
THE BLOOD TEST
RESULTS BACK.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.040
WHY WASTE IT IF
WE DON'T HAVE TO?

02:25.040 --> 02:26.880
IF IT'S USED
TO SAVE A PATIENT,
IT CAN'T BE A WASTE.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.880
HE'S STABLE. WE CAN WAIT.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.010
NURSE JOY, GO SEE WHAT'S
TAKING SO LONG TO GET
HIM IN FOR AN MRI.

02:33.380 --> 02:36.300
I WONDER IF HE WERE
A DIFFERENT PATIENT,
WOULD HE HAVE TO WAIT?

02:36.300 --> 02:38.220
OLIVIA: SPENCER
DIDN'T SHOVE ME.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.180
HE PUSHED ME TO SAVE
MY LIFE WHILE HE WAS
BEING SHOT,

02:42.180 --> 02:43.640
AND WE BOTH FELL
TO THE GROUND.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.440
I BROKE OUR FALL.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.810
-DID HE RETURN FIRE?
-WHAT? NO.

02:47.810 --> 02:49.190
LOOK, YOU SHOULD BE
OUT CHASING DOWN

02:49.190 --> 02:51.280
THOSE GUYS IN THAT
CAR WHO SHOT US.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.320
THAT'S BEING LOOKED INTO.
I HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.320
I'D LIKE MY PHONE,
PLEASE.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.700
YOU'LL GET IT BACK
SOON ENOUGH.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.330
-MRI IS READY. WE CAN TAKE HIM.
-CANCEL IT.

03:00.330 --> 03:02.240
THERE'S NO EXIT WOUND.
THE BULLET'S STILL INSIDE.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.830
I ALREADY REQUESTED
A CT SCAN.

03:03.830 --> 03:05.460
JOY: AND THE TRANSFUSION?
EVERET: NO TIME.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.460
WE'RE WHEELING HIM DOWN
TO IMAGING IN 5.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.080
AND HIS
PAIN LEVELS?

03:09.080 --> 03:11.420
WOMAN: HIS TEST GOT
HELD UP AT THE LAB.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.420
THAT IS NOT OK.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.050
IT'S NOT OK, AND
THIS IS NOT THE BEST
THAT WE CAN DO

03:16.050 --> 03:17.720
AS HEALTHCARE
PROFESSIONALS.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.010
AND REGARDLESS OF
WHO THIS MAN IS,

03:20.010 --> 03:22.470
HE IS A PATIENT
IN NEED OF OUR CARE.

03:22.470 --> 03:26.140
AND BY GOD, I HAVE
EVERY INTENTION OF
DOING THAT TODAY.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.770
NOW, IF HE'S
GONNA GET THAT
BLOOD TRANSFUSION,

03:27.770 --> 03:30.020
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW.

03:31.940 --> 03:35.740
ORDER THE O-NEGATIVE BLOOD
FOR THE TRANSFUSION.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.160
NURSE: YOU TORE YOUR
SCAPHOLUNATE LIGAMENT
IN YOUR WRIST.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.080
IT SHOULDN'T REQUIRE
SURGERY, BUT THE DOCTOR
WILL CONFIRM.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.790
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL GET YOU
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.370
UH, NO, THANKS.
I'M FINE.

03:48.570 --> 03:50.870
LIKE I WAS
SAYING, SPENCER'S
A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT

03:50.870 --> 03:52.290
AT BEVERLY HIGH.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.080
YOU CAN CONFIRM
THAT WITH HIS MOM.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.120
-GRACE JAMES, CORRECT?
-YES. SHE'S ON THE WAY.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.130
SHE WAS IN ANAHEIM
WITH HER YOUNGER SON
AND HER BOYFRIEND.

03:59.130 --> 04:02.590
SO WHY WERE THE TWO OF YOU
ON THAT STREET CORNER?

04:02.590 --> 04:05.010
IT'S OXYCODONE.

04:07.930 --> 04:12.390
I'M--I'M A RECOVERING ADDICT.
I CAN'T HAVE NARCOTICS.

04:12.390 --> 04:15.270
SO WAS THE SHOOTING
A DRUG DEAL GONE BAD?

04:20.900 --> 04:24.780
-NO. NO!
-YOU'RE OK. YOU'RE OK.

04:27.110 --> 04:29.160
THAT GIRL WHO WAS
WITH ME EARLIER.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.820
COULD YOU PLEASE PAGE HER?

04:30.820 --> 04:33.700
NO ONE OUTSIDE OF
FAMILY CAN SEE YOU.

04:33.700 --> 04:34.910
NOW, IF SHE WERE--

04:34.910 --> 04:36.580
PLEASE, PLEASE.
I GOT--

04:36.580 --> 04:38.170
I GOT TO TALK TO HER.
IT'S A MATTER OF
LIFE OR DEATH.

04:38.170 --> 04:40.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.710
I CAN'T LET HER IN
UNLESS SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

04:43.710 --> 04:47.010
I GOT TO TALK TO MY SISTER.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.510
OK.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.390
-I DON'T KNOW.
-PROTECTING YOUR--

04:56.390 --> 05:00.020
PROTECTING YOUR FRIEND
WILL ONLY LAND YOU
IN MORE TROUBLE.

05:01.860 --> 05:05.030
OLIVIA, SWEETIE,
TIME TO GO
FOR SOME TESTS.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.780
EXCUSE ME. WE'RE NOT DONE.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.990
OFFICER, IF I'M NOT
MISTAKEN,

05:08.990 --> 05:11.120
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
QUESTION MINORS WITHOUT
A PARENT BEING PRESENT.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.830
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP
HER FRIEND.

05:12.830 --> 05:15.950
YOU DONE HELPING?
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

05:15.950 --> 05:17.660
LET'S GO.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.250
HE HAS MY CELL PHONE.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.380
GIVE THE GIRL
HER PHONE BACK.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.930
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.060
HI. HOW--HOW--
HOW ARE YOU?

05:39.060 --> 05:41.810
HOW DO YOU FEEL? DO YOU--
DO YOU NEED SURGERY?

05:41.810 --> 05:44.190
I'M FINE. HEY, HEY.

05:44.190 --> 05:47.030
BUT I WON'T BE IF YOU
DON'T FIND COOP AND GET
HER HERE, ALL RIGHT?

05:47.030 --> 05:48.900
YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT
THE WRONG PERSON.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.110
TYRONE DID THIS,
OLIVIA, ALL RIGHT?

05:51.110 --> 05:52.870
HE SET THIS UP.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.990
AND I GOT TO MAKE SURE
THAT NOBODY DO NOTHING

05:54.990 --> 05:57.410
THAT'S GONNA GET COOP
OR ANYBODY ELSE KILLED,
SO PLEASE.

05:57.410 --> 05:59.370
MY MOM SHOULD BE
HERE ANY MINUTE,
AND SHE CAN HELP--

05:59.370 --> 06:01.500
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I NEED COOP. ALL RIGHT?

06:01.500 --> 06:04.840
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
SOMEBODY RETALIATES
IN MY NAME

06:04.840 --> 06:07.250
AND TRIGGERS A FULL-ON
GANG WAR, YOU HEAR ME?

06:07.250 --> 06:09.460
A GANG WAR.

06:09.460 --> 06:11.090
THIS IS MY ONE CHANCE
TO STOP THE BLOODSHED.
PLEASE FIND HER.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.890
OK, OK.

06:13.890 --> 06:16.720
-FIND COOP.
-OK.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.610
SPENCER...

06:27.610 --> 06:30.940
YOUR OTHER
SISTER IS HERE.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.540
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.130
COOP, YOU GOT TO BE
STRONG.

06:50.630 --> 06:53.260
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.390
ANYTHING.

06:55.390 --> 06:59.390
FIND FLIP, AND DELIVER
A MESSAGE TO HIM
DIRECTLY FROM ME.

06:59.390 --> 07:03.020
TELL HIM NOT
TO GO AFTER TYRONE.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.400
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.440
I'M BEGGING YOU,
PLEASE.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.650
I DON'T WANT NOBODY
SHOOTING IN MY NAME.

07:09.650 --> 07:13.450
FLIP DONE WARNED TYRONE
THAT ME AND MY FAMILY
WAS OFF-LIMITS,

07:13.450 --> 07:15.660
AND NOW HE GONNA WANT
REVENGE.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.620
AND I CAN'T HAVE
THE BLOOD OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD ON MY HANDS,

07:17.620 --> 07:19.240
YOU HEAR ME?

07:21.410 --> 07:22.620
I CAN'T.

07:22.620 --> 07:23.750
I PROMISE.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.500
THEN IT'S ON GOD.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.800
I--I CAN'T FEEL
YOUR HAND.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
WHAT?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.590
I CAN'T FEEL YOUR HAND.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.510
I CAN'T FEEL
YOUR HAND.

07:38.510 --> 07:40.220
HEY! HEY! SOMEBODY HELP!

07:40.220 --> 07:41.680
JOY: WHAT'S GOING ON?
COOP: SOMEBODY?

07:41.680 --> 07:43.640
OK. BACK UP OUT OF THE WAY
FOR ME FOR A SECOND.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.850
MY SHOULDER'S ON FIRE.

07:44.850 --> 07:47.020
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE OK.
BREATHE.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.190
I NEED YOU
TO GET OUT OF HERE.
I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE TO GO.

07:48.190 --> 07:49.650
JOY: SPENCER.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.650
MY HAND, MY HAND!
I CAN'T FEEL MY HAND.

07:51.650 --> 07:54.240
JOY: TAKE A DEEP BREATH, OK?

07:55.700 --> 07:56.700
HEY.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.320
OHH.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.240
THANK GOD. ARE YOU--
ARE YOU HURT?

08:01.240 --> 08:02.990
NO. IT'S JUST A STRAIN.

08:02.990 --> 08:04.700
OH, THANK GOD.
I THOUGHT THAT--

08:04.700 --> 08:06.500
-I'M FINE.
-OK.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
BUT IT WAS SO CRAZY,

08:08.500 --> 08:10.750
AND IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.670
AND SPENCER--I MEAN,
YOU'RE, LIKE, HIS LEGAL
GUARDIAN OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

08:12.670 --> 08:14.460
-YEAH, YEAH.
-YOU CAN VERIFY HIS IDENTITY.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.260
SHH, SHH. IT'S OK.
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.220
IS HE GONNA BE OK?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.010
MOM, MOM.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.310
WAIT. HOW BAD IS IT?

08:29.310 --> 08:31.150
UM, OLIVIA'S OK.
SHE'S WITH DAD.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.940
SPENCER--WE DON'T KNOW YET,
BUT HE'S A FIGHTER, SO...

08:33.940 --> 08:35.860
MY GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
IS REALLY HAPPENING.

08:35.860 --> 08:37.740
I NEED YOU TO STAY
HERE, JORDAN, OK?

08:37.740 --> 08:39.700
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
HAPPENING TO YOU.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.870
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. I THOUGHT
DAD SAID NO ONE ELSE
SHOULD LEAVE THE HOUSE.

08:41.870 --> 08:43.950
I KNOW, BUT I NEED TO
MAKE SURE THE COPS GET
THE RIGHT GUY.

08:43.950 --> 08:46.040
-MOM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
-JUST STAY HERE, JORDAN.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.760
UH, NOW IS NOT
A GOOD TIME, CLIFF.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.680
I HEARD ABOUT
THE SHOOTING.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.930
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN
AND OFFER MY SUPPORT

09:00.930 --> 09:03.470
AND, OF COURSE, EXTEND
MY RESOURCES TO YOU
AND SPENCER'S FAMILY.

09:03.470 --> 09:04.970
WE'RE FINE.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.100
WELL, I KNOW YOU'LL
BE THERE ALL NIGHT,

09:07.100 --> 09:10.730
SO IF YOU NEED
SOMETHING, PLEASE DON'T
HESITATE TO CALL.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.480
I KNOW SPENCER
WILL PULL THROUGH.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.190
YEAH, WE ALL DO.

09:25.370 --> 09:27.910
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE'S MY BABY?

09:27.910 --> 09:31.290
GRACIE, WE'RE WAITING
ON AN UPDATE. HE'S WITH
THE DOCTORS NOW. HE'S OK.

09:31.290 --> 09:33.630
BILLY: BREATHE. HE'S OK.
GRACE: HEY, WHAT IS THIS?

09:33.630 --> 09:35.960
WHERE'S DILLON?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.960
OH, WE, UH, WE LEFT
HIM WITH MICAH
UNTIL WE KNEW,

09:37.960 --> 09:39.630
BUT WAIT. HOW COULD
THIS HAPPEN?

09:39.630 --> 09:42.800
I MEAN, LIKE, WHO WOULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

09:42.800 --> 09:45.810
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CONDENSED VERSION.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.810
I'M HIS MOTHER.

09:47.810 --> 09:49.350
EITHER SOMEBODY
TAKE ME BACK TO SEE
MY SON RIGHT NOW

09:49.350 --> 09:51.850
-OR I'M GONNA GO THERE MYSELF.
-MS. JAMES?

09:51.850 --> 09:53.400
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,
OK? SPENCER IS STABLE.
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU TO HIM.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.110
-OK. THANK--THANK YOU.
-LET'S GO.

09:55.110 --> 09:58.230
GO, GO. I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.
I'MA BE RIGHT HERE, GRACIE.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.990
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU--YOU SAID HIS
NAME WAS TYRONE?

10:00.990 --> 10:02.820
YEAH. WHY? WHAT IS IT?

10:05.030 --> 10:08.330
JOY: HERE YOU GO.
GRACE: OH, GOD. BABY.

10:08.330 --> 10:09.870
MOM.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.790
GRACE:
YOU OK? IT'S OK. I'M HERE, BABY.

10:11.790 --> 10:13.370
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

10:13.370 --> 10:16.630
-I'M SORRY.
-IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

10:16.630 --> 10:18.840
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,
MS. JAMES.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.670
I WAS JUST TELLING
YOUR SON THAT

10:20.670 --> 10:22.680
HE IS FAMOUS
IN OUR HOUSE.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.550
MY DAUGHTER GOES TO
BEVERLY,

10:24.550 --> 10:27.010
THINKS VERY HIGHLY
OF YOU, SPENCER.

10:27.010 --> 10:29.020
A STRAIGHT-A
STUDENT ATHLETE.

10:29.020 --> 10:32.190
YOU LED THE EAGLES
TO A CHAMPIONSHIP.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.940
I'M DR. TAYLOR,
YOUR NEUROSURGEON.

10:34.940 --> 10:38.270
WHY DO I NEED
A NEUROSURGEON?

10:38.270 --> 10:41.490
THIS IS A CLUSTER
OF NERVES CALLED
THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS,

10:41.490 --> 10:43.610
AND IT'S PART OF
THE PERIPHERY NERVES.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.870
THE BULLET WENT THROUGH
THE CLUSTER.

10:45.870 --> 10:48.450
LUCKY FOR YOU,
IT DIDN'T TRANSECT THEM,

10:48.450 --> 10:50.240
BUT THE BULLET
DIDN'T EXIT.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.370
IT'S HERE, WHICH IS
WHY I WAS TAGGED IN.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.790
HOW BAD IS IT?

10:55.790 --> 10:58.880
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY
MORTAL DANGER, SPENCER.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.590
GRACE: THANK GOD.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.920
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S
NOT ALL GOOD NEWS.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.840
YOU HAVE A DECISION TO
MAKE ABOUT THAT BULLET.

11:04.840 --> 11:08.050
WE COULD LEAVE IT IN,
AND YOU'LL BE FINE,

11:08.050 --> 11:10.430
BUT WITH LIMITED
RANGE OF MOTION

11:10.430 --> 11:14.060
AND A BULLET DRIFTING
IN YOUR BODY,

11:14.060 --> 11:17.110
IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY
END YOUR FOOTBALL CAREER

11:17.110 --> 11:19.940
FOREVER.

11:21.820 --> 11:23.650
OR?

11:25.530 --> 11:27.950
WE CAN ATTEMPT
TO REMOVE THE BULLET,

11:27.950 --> 11:31.330
ALONG WITH THE LARGER
SHRAPNEL IN
A COMPLICATED SURGERY,

11:31.330 --> 11:33.000
BUT THERE ARE
MAJOR RISKS.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.500
IF IT'S NOT SUCCESSFUL,

11:36.500 --> 11:40.040
THE SURGERY COULD LEAVE
YOUR ARM PARALYZED.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.420
PARALYZED?

11:41.420 --> 11:44.670
TAYLOR: I CAN ONLY
OFFER MY OPINION,

11:44.670 --> 11:47.090
BUT AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

11:47.090 --> 11:49.140
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.450
LAYLA?

12:10.450 --> 12:15.450
SPENCER, HEY. UM, SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU.

12:15.450 --> 12:17.080
NAH, YOU'RE GOOD.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.670
I WAS JUST CLEANING UP
WHILE YOUR MOM RESTS,

12:18.670 --> 12:20.540
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
YOU'RE UP, I'LL GO GRAB HER.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.090
LAYLA, HOLD UP.

12:22.090 --> 12:24.960
MY MOM PROBABLY
NEEDS SOME REST.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.970
AND, HONESTLY,
I COULD USE A MINUTE.

12:27.970 --> 12:29.680
OK.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.100
I HEARD THE BULLET'S
STILL IN THERE.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.020
YEAH. I GOT TO LET
THE DOCTORS KNOW IN
THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS

12:43.020 --> 12:44.610
WHETHER WE LEAVING
IT IN OR NOT.

12:44.610 --> 12:47.360
IS THE SURGERY AS RISKY
AS EVERYONE'S SAYING?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.110
IT COULD LEAVE MY
WHOLE RIGHT SIDE
PARALYZED

12:49.110 --> 12:50.530
IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.830
AND IF YOU LEAVE
THE BULLET IN?

12:54.830 --> 12:57.620
I'D SET OFF EVERY
METAL DETECTOR I
WALK THROUGH.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.920
WHAT ABOUT FOOTBALL?

13:03.920 --> 13:06.210
NEVER.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.380
IT'D BE A WRAP.

13:11.010 --> 13:14.970
I KNOW I QUIT.

13:14.970 --> 13:17.850
PLAYING WAS JUST
TOO PAINFUL AFTER
MY POPS DIED, BUT--

13:17.850 --> 13:20.440
FOREVER IS
A LONG TIME.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.650
AND EVEN THOUGH
PLAYING HURTS NOW,

13:23.650 --> 13:25.610
MAYBE IT WON'T HURT FOREVER.

13:25.610 --> 13:28.360
IS MAYBE WORTH
THE RISK, THOUGH?

13:28.360 --> 13:30.860
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT
FOR YOU.

13:33.450 --> 13:35.620
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

13:35.620 --> 13:38.580
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'D
COME BACK TO THE GAME
EVENTUALLY.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.670
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.920
DIDN'T YOU?

13:53.050 --> 13:54.970
FLIP: HEY, MAN,
LISTEN, I'M TELLING
YOU RIGHT NOW,

13:54.970 --> 13:57.560
THIS FOOL,
HE LOST HIS MIND.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.470
AIN'T NONE OF THIS
GOING DOWN LIKE THAT.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.190
FLIP: I AIN'T GOT
TIME FOR YOU, COOP.

14:04.190 --> 14:06.820
LOOK, MAN, SPENCER SENT ME.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.110
SPENCER GOT
A LOT OF LOVE FOR YOU.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.150
SPENCER'S FAMILY.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.780
I KNOW, BUT HE DON'T
WANT TO BE THE SPARK
THAT CAUSES NO WAR.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.570
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

14:15.570 --> 14:18.080
IF YOU AND YOUR BOYS
DO WHAT YOU TALKING
ABOUT DOING.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.830
THIS AIN'T NO NEGOTIATION,
LITTLE HOMIE.

14:20.830 --> 14:23.290
TYRONE AND EVERYBODY IN
THIS HOOD KNOW THAT
THE JAMES FAMILY ARE

14:23.290 --> 14:25.210
MY PEOPLE.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.250
AND LAST NIGHT, TY WAS
MAKING A STATEMENT,

14:27.250 --> 14:29.800
A STATEMENT THAT'S ONE
THAT I CAN'T LET GO
UNANSWERED.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.840
BUT IF YOU
AND THE O.G.s POP TY

14:31.840 --> 14:33.430
OVER SOME KID WHO AIN'T
EVEN IN A GANG?

14:33.430 --> 14:35.510
YOU DON'T GET IT!

14:35.510 --> 14:40.100
I SEE A MAD DOG,
AND THAT DAMN MAD DOG
GOT TO BE PUT DOWN

14:40.100 --> 14:41.680
EVEN IF HE WEARS
MY COLORS.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.270
THEN YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
TYRONE GOT TO DIE.

14:45.270 --> 14:47.060
WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU
AIN'T GOT TO DO IT.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.690
I DO.

14:48.690 --> 14:51.190
YOU DO IT, YOU STARTING
A WHOLE CIVIL WAR--

14:51.190 --> 14:53.200
BLOODS KILLING BLOODS
ON EVERY BLOCK.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.910
SO IT WON'T JUST BE
SPENCER IN A HOSPITAL
OR IN THE GROUND.

14:56.910 --> 14:59.280
BUT IF I DO IT,
IT'S PERSONAL.

14:59.280 --> 15:02.870
OK? THAT BEEF BETWEEN
A SNITCH AND THE BANGER
SHE SNITCHED ON.

15:02.870 --> 15:07.500
I STARTED IT,
SO I'LL END IT.

15:07.500 --> 15:14.130
OK, COOP, I'MA GIVE
YOU 24 HOURS TO TAKE
YOUR BEST SHOT.

15:14.130 --> 15:19.140
BUT IF TYRONE
IS BREATHING
TOMORROW MORNING,

15:19.140 --> 15:21.720
I HANDLE BUSINESS.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.850
AND IF IT STARTS A WAR,
SO BE IT, BLOOD.

15:25.850 --> 15:28.310
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

15:37.950 --> 15:40.700
HEY. SORRY TO JUST
SHOW UP LIKE THIS,

15:40.700 --> 15:42.120
BUT YOU WEREN'T
RESPONDING TO MY TEXTS.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.790
LOOK, SIMONE, I'M NOT
AVOIDING YOU, OK?

15:44.790 --> 15:47.170
I JUST CAN'T DEAL WITH
WHATEVER THIS IS RIGHT NOW.

15:47.170 --> 15:49.920
-I REALLY NEED TO GET TO--
-THE HOSPITAL. I KNOW.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.380
ABOUT THE DRIVE-BY,

15:52.380 --> 15:54.170
OLIVIA AND SPENCER.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.510
I HEARD MY MOM TALKING
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

15:55.510 --> 15:57.300
-WAIT, WAIT. YOUR MOM?
-YEAH.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.180
SHE'S ON
THE SCHOOL BOARD.

15:59.180 --> 16:01.390
LOOK, LAST NIGHT,
PRINCIPAL LONDON
AND CLIFF MOSELY

16:01.390 --> 16:03.010
CALLED FOR
AN EMERGENCY MEETING

16:03.010 --> 16:04.600
WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD
AND THE BOOSTERS.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.520
TO DISCUSS WHAT?

16:06.520 --> 16:08.190
WE BOTH KNOW THAT CLIFF
HAS IT OUT FOR YOUR DAD.

16:08.190 --> 16:10.360
AND HE WAS REALLY ADAMANT
THAT THE MEETING HAPPEN TODAY.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.230
WHEN MY DAD'S PREOCCUPIED
AT THE HOSPITAL.

16:12.230 --> 16:14.190
EXACTLY. JORDAN,
WHATEVER IT IS THAT
CLIFF IS PLANNING,

16:14.190 --> 16:15.900
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE
GOOD FOR YOUR DAD.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.160
OK. UM, WELL, I NEED TO
GET A HOLD OF ROCHELLE,

16:19.160 --> 16:20.780
'CAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN CONTROL CLIFF.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.370
YEAH, WELL, ROCHELLE'S GONE.

16:22.370 --> 16:24.540
SHE WENT BACK TO COLLEGE
AFTER THE FALLOUT

16:24.540 --> 16:27.370
THAT SHE HAD WITH HER DAD
OVER THE CRENSHAW REMATCH.

16:27.370 --> 16:30.920
LOOK, JUST TELL YOUR DAD
THE MEETING'S AT 5 P.M.
IN THE CONFERENCE HALL.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.130
OK?

16:32.130 --> 16:35.130
YEAH. SIMONE, WAIT.

16:38.170 --> 16:41.970
THANK YOU FOR LOOKING OUT.

16:41.970 --> 16:43.970
I MEAN, YOUR FAMILY,
THEY WERE REALLY
GOOD TO ME.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.600
AND I OWED YOU
THIS AT LEAST.

17:05.830 --> 17:07.370
WHAT UP, D.?

17:07.370 --> 17:09.290
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
TO MY BOY LAST NIGHT.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.290
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
I WAS HERE WITH YOU.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.080
DARNELL: NAH, NAH.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO
YOU ARE, TYRONE.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.960
YOU REALLY THINK I'M
GONNA LET YOUR
PUNK ASS SIT HERE

17:14.960 --> 17:16.380
AND GET AWAY WITH TRYING
TO KILL SPENCER?

17:16.380 --> 17:18.380
HEY, YO, YO, YO, YO, YO.
BRO. BRO, BRO,

17:18.380 --> 17:21.430
LET'S JUST CHILL, OK?
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

17:21.430 --> 17:23.680
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST GO.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.560
IF YOU REALLY KNEW
WHO I WAS, YOU'D BE
RUNNING RIGHT NOW.

17:29.270 --> 17:31.310
LISTEN TO YOUR HOMIE.

17:31.310 --> 17:33.020
TAKE YOUR LITTLE
BITCH ASS HOME.

17:34.810 --> 17:38.280
DETECTIVE POWORSKI,
BEVERLY HILLS
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.400
LOOKING FOR
A TYRONE MOORE.

17:42.410 --> 17:44.030
NEVER MIND.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.290
GOT SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU, MR. MOORE.

17:48.290 --> 17:50.620
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?

17:50.620 --> 17:52.420
LIKE, WHERE
WERE YOU LAST NIGHT

17:52.420 --> 17:54.880
BETWEEN 11:00
AND 1 A.M.?

17:54.880 --> 17:58.300
TYRONE: LAST NIGHT,
I WAS, UH, ACTUALLY HERE.

17:58.300 --> 18:03.130
RIGHT? WITH MY BOY DARNELL.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, D.?

18:09.810 --> 18:13.650
TAYLOR: I'LL GIVE
YOU TWO A MINUTE TO TALK.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.610
THANK YOU.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.070
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

18:21.070 --> 18:23.360
SURGERY.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.910
THE ONE THAT
RISKS LEAVING HALF
YOUR BODY PARALYZED?

18:25.910 --> 18:27.280
MOM, I NEED YOU
TO LISTEN.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.660
NO, SPENCER, YOU LISTEN.

18:28.660 --> 18:31.250
YOU CAN STILL HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.460
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A BLESSING THAT IS?

18:32.460 --> 18:34.960
-OF COURSE I DO.
-THEN WHY RISK IT?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.130
BECAUSE I'M NOT READY
FOR A LIFE WHERE I DON'T
GET BACK ON THAT FIELD.

18:37.130 --> 18:40.460
FOOTBALL.
YOU QUIT FOOTBALL.

18:40.460 --> 18:43.090
BECAUSE IT WAS
TOO PAINFUL TO PLAY
AFTER DAD DIED.

18:43.090 --> 18:46.260
BUT I REALIZE NOW
THAT THE REASON IT
HURT SO MUCH IS

18:46.260 --> 18:48.430
THE EXACT REASON I
CAN'T LET IT GO YET.

18:48.430 --> 18:50.060
I CAN'T.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.850
IT'S JUST A GAME, SON.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.480
THAT'S WHERE I FEEL
CLOSEST TO HIM.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.570
AND DEEP DOWN, I THINK
I ALWAYS KNEW I'D COME
BACK TO THE GAME

18:58.570 --> 19:00.860
WHEN I WAS READY.

19:00.860 --> 19:04.900
SPENCER, YOU AND YOUR
FATHER SHARED A CONNECTION

19:04.900 --> 19:07.370
THE MOMENT HE HANDED
YOU A BALL.

19:07.370 --> 19:10.990
AND I KNOW THAT HE'D
BELIEVE IN THE MAN
THAT YOU ARE

19:10.990 --> 19:14.000
OFF THE FIELD JUST AS MUCH
AS THE MAN ON THE FIELD.

19:18.170 --> 19:21.420
BLOCK OUT YOUR FEARS.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.970
TACKLE YOUR PROBLEMS
HEAD-ON,

19:23.970 --> 19:26.260
AND ALWAYS FINISH STRONG.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.510
HE USED TO TELL ME
THOSE WERE THE KEYS
TO SUCCESS IN LIFE

19:30.510 --> 19:33.180
AND ON THE FIELD.

19:33.180 --> 19:36.390
HE SAID GOD MADE 'EM
THE SAME SO WE
WOULDN'T FORGET.

19:36.390 --> 19:41.020
I DON'T THINK IT'S
GOSPEL, BUT I REMEMBER.

19:44.030 --> 19:46.780
THAT'S HIS LEGACY.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.200
THAT'S THE MAN
I WANT TO BE.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.620
AND EVEN THOUGH
I'M AFRAID,

19:52.620 --> 19:54.790
I WON'T
MAKE THIS DECISION
OUT OF FEAR.

19:56.750 --> 20:00.000
I PROMISE YOU, MOM,
I PROMISE WITH
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.380
I WILL FINISH STRONG.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.630
I PROMISE.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.750
YO, PREACH, WHAT
THE HELL YOU DOING?

20:36.750 --> 20:38.790
STOPPING YOU FROM DOING
SOMETHING STUPID.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.170
I HEARD WHAT TYRONE
DID TO YOUR BOY.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.050
-SO?
-SO I KNOW WHAT YOU ABOUT TO DO.

20:46.050 --> 20:47.670
MAN, AIN'T NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

20:47.670 --> 20:49.090
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'MA DO ANYWAY.

20:49.090 --> 20:50.760
KNEW YOU'D BE HERE, DIDN'T I?

20:53.220 --> 20:55.560
WHERE'S YOUR "COOP"
NECKLACE?

20:55.560 --> 20:59.190
MAN, YOU AIN'T GOT TO
THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE.

20:59.190 --> 21:00.980
YOU AIN'T GONNA CHANGE
MY MIND ON THIS, PREACH.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.570
TYRONE GOT TO DIE.

21:03.570 --> 21:06.820
THINK YOU THE FIRST
TO TRY, HMM?

21:06.820 --> 21:09.650
KILLING A CAT LIKE
TYRONE AIN'T EASY.

21:09.650 --> 21:11.610
WELL, UNLESS YOU CAME
HERE TO GIVE ME
SOME TIPS, YOU CAN GO.

21:11.610 --> 21:13.530
'CAUSE IF I DON'T TAKE
CARE OF TY TODAY,

21:13.530 --> 21:14.990
FLIP GONNA DO IT
TOMORROW.

21:14.990 --> 21:16.660
AND WE'LL HAVE BLOODS
SHOOTING BLOODS

21:16.660 --> 21:18.290
IN THE MIDDLE OF
CRENSHAW BY NEXT WEEK.

21:18.290 --> 21:19.710
IT GOT TO BE ME.

21:19.710 --> 21:23.500
NO. I CAN DO IT.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.500
MAN, THIS AIN'T LIKE
WHEN YOU BEAT BUGGS' ASS.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.880
YOU A BLOOD, SAME AS FLIP.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.800
TYRONE ALREADY PUT
4 BULLETS IN ME.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.930
IF I TAKE HIM OUT,
IT'S REVENGE, PERSONAL,

21:31.930 --> 21:33.470
LONG OVERDUE.

21:33.470 --> 21:34.720
THIS AIN'T ON YOU, PREACH.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.470
HE CAME AFTER SPENCER,
MY FAMILY!

21:37.470 --> 21:41.640
I STARTED THIS,
SO I'MA END IT.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.650
NOT EVERYBODY CAN PULL
THE TRIGGER, COOP.

21:44.650 --> 21:47.230
IT DON'T MATTER HOW
DETERMINED YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW.

21:47.230 --> 21:49.860
YOU WON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU
STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM.

21:51.650 --> 21:54.950
SO--SO YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT?

21:54.950 --> 21:56.370
I HOPE YOU CAN'T.

21:56.370 --> 21:58.540
BUT EVEN IF I'M WRONG,

21:58.540 --> 22:00.870
KNOWING THE ANSWER TO
THAT QUESTION...

22:03.830 --> 22:05.630
IF YOU CAN KILL A MAN...

22:08.500 --> 22:10.340
IT CHANGES A PERSON.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.140
IT CHANGED ME.

22:16.890 --> 22:19.140
I DON'T WANT IT
TO CHANGE YOU.

22:31.940 --> 22:34.190
-WHAT'S UP, BRO?
-HEY.

22:34.190 --> 22:36.270
HEY, MAN.

22:37.770 --> 22:40.190
HEY, LISTEN,
I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING WITH ME, MAN.

22:40.190 --> 22:44.410
BET, MAN. A LITTLE
SCHOOLYARD BEEF DON'T MEAN
SPENCER AIN'T FAMILY.

22:44.410 --> 22:46.950
I APPRECIATE
THAT, BRO.

22:46.950 --> 22:47.990
HEY.

22:49.490 --> 22:50.700
WHAT'S UP?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.960
DAD, LOOK, I KNOW
THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME,

22:53.960 --> 22:55.630
BUT I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

22:55.630 --> 22:56.750
OK.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.750
CLIFF CALLED
AN EMERGENCY MEETING

22:58.750 --> 23:00.920
WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD
AND THE BOOSTERS.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.880
I THINK HE'S PLANNING
TO TAKE YOUR--

23:02.880 --> 23:05.140
WOW. HE'S COMING
FOR MY JOB.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.930
I KNEW HE WAS UP
TO SOMETHING. DAMN IT.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.930
YOU CAN STILL STOP THIS, OK?

23:09.930 --> 23:11.770
THE MEETING IS NOT
FOR A FEW MORE HOURS.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.770
AND CLIFF IS FULLY
EXPECTING YOU NOT TO BE
THERE TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

23:13.770 --> 23:16.810
HE'S RIGHT. I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

23:16.810 --> 23:20.530
DAD, LOOK, I GET IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE
SPENCER EITHER, OK?

23:20.530 --> 23:22.150
BUT IF YOU STILL WANT
TO BE THE COACH OF
THE BEVERLY EAGLES,

23:22.150 --> 23:23.950
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

23:23.950 --> 23:25.570
I MADE MY CHOICE.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.950
I'M NOT GONNA PUT THIS
JOB BEFORE MY FAMILY.

23:28.950 --> 23:31.830
AND I'M NOT GONNA
CHANGE WHO I AM JUST
SO I CAN BEAT CLIFF.

23:31.830 --> 23:33.040
IF THIS IS HOW HE
WANTS TO PLAY,

23:33.040 --> 23:35.870
THEN HE WINS.

23:35.870 --> 23:37.000
IT'S OK.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.930
SOON AS SPENCER GOES
INTO SURGERY,

23:48.930 --> 23:51.010
WE'LL TAKE YOU HOME
AND GET YOU
CLEANED UP, OK?

23:51.010 --> 23:53.140
NO, MOM. I CAN'T LEAVE HIM.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.980
WE'LL BE BACK BEFORE
HE'S AWAKE.

23:55.980 --> 23:58.060
HEY.

23:58.060 --> 24:00.820
HONEY, ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?

24:07.070 --> 24:08.780
LIV, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.240
I DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF
THOSE THINGS

24:10.240 --> 24:12.700
THAT I SAID, AND I
SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.960
JUST SHUT UP.
OK, YOU'RE HERE.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.790
EVERYTHING ELSE
CAN WAIT, OK?

24:21.800 --> 24:23.170
OK.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.860
EVERYONE,
LISTEN TO ME.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
THIS IS NOT A FUNERAL.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.490
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND?

24:50.490 --> 24:54.910
MY SON PROMISED ME
HE WILL COME THROUGH
THIS SURGERY WHOLE.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.120
WHOLE.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.920
I BELIEVE HIM.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.040
AND SPENCER NEEDS
HIS FAMILY--

25:01.040 --> 25:07.050
ALL OF HIS FAMILY--
TO BELIEVE IN HIM RIGHT NOW.

25:07.050 --> 25:08.510
AM I CLEAR?

25:15.140 --> 25:17.480
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.020
I KNOW I WAS IN AND OUT,
BUT I HEARD YOU

25:19.020 --> 25:21.310
FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE
OUT THERE.

25:21.310 --> 25:24.480
IF WE DON'T FIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER,
WHO'S GOING TO?

25:24.480 --> 25:27.940
THE SIGNS SAY
THE SURGICAL WARD
IS THAT WAY.

25:27.940 --> 25:30.780
YEAH, THERE'S ANOTHER STOP
THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE FIRST.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.780
BILLY: THERE HE IS.
DARNELL: HEY.

25:32.780 --> 25:33.950
-SPENCE.
-HA HA.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.370
-YEAH.
-HEY, MAN.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.500
LET'S HOPE HE FEELS
BETTER THAN HE LOOKS.

25:43.960 --> 25:44.960
GOOD LUCK, SPENCE.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.760
HEY, MAN,
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.340
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.350
EVERYTHING GOOD?

25:56.350 --> 25:58.560
YEAH, MAN. I GOT
EVERYTHING HANDLED
DOWN IN CRENSHAW.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.100
YOU WORRY ABOUT YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

26:00.100 --> 26:01.480
ALL RIGHT.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.190
-ALL RIGHT, BABY.
-I'LL SEE YOU SOON, MOM.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.150
THE GAME'S NOT
OVER JUST YET.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.280
BUT IT'S OVER FOR YOU.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.150
YOU EVER PLAY SOME
PICKUP BALL IN PRISON?

28:58.150 --> 28:59.570
SAN QUENTIN?

28:59.570 --> 29:03.120
TWO STRIKES. THAT'S
AT LEAST 10 YEARS.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.540
GOT TO PASS
THE TIME, RIGHT?

29:04.540 --> 29:07.080
YOU AIN'T TALKING YOUR ASS
OUT OF THIS ONE.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.120
LET'S GO.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.750
WE BOTH KNOW YOU
AIN'T GONNA POP ME IN
THE MIDDLE OF THIS PARK.

29:14.130 --> 29:16.510
THE SAME AS I KNEW
YOU'D STEP UP AND DO
COOP'S DIRTY WORK.

29:16.510 --> 29:19.470
SEE, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT LIVING BY
THE CODE, PREACH.

29:19.470 --> 29:21.180
IT MAKES YOU PREDICTABLE.

29:21.180 --> 29:23.600
SEE, THAT'S HOW I
SPENT MY TIME IN JAIL.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.810
I FIGURED OUT WHAT
I WAS GONNA DO TO
YOU ALL WHEN I GOT OUT.

29:27.350 --> 29:30.400
OH, SO NOW YOU SNITCHING
TO THE POLICE?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.190
NAH, NOT ME,
BUT I MIGHT'VE
ENCOURAGED SOMEBODY TO.

29:34.190 --> 29:37.150
OFFICER: ON YOUR KNEES.
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM!

29:37.150 --> 29:38.240
NOW!

29:39.530 --> 29:41.200
THIS AIN'T OVER.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.950
THIS POSSESSION CHARGE
AIN'T GONNA HOLD ME LONG.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.160
BUT THE THIRD STRIKE
WILL.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.160
OFFICER: CORDELL SIMMS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE ASSAULT

29:47.160 --> 29:48.500
OF ROBERT "BUGGS" MOODY.

30:06.390 --> 30:07.930
WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU ATE?

30:07.930 --> 30:09.230
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

30:09.230 --> 30:10.730
YOU SHOULD EAT
SOMETHING, GRACE.

30:10.730 --> 30:12.730
ALL I WANT IS MY SON
OUT OF SURGERY.

30:12.730 --> 30:14.360
THAT WILL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

30:18.820 --> 30:21.280
-I'M SORRY.
-THAT'S OK.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.410
IT'S JUST...

30:23.410 --> 30:25.660
THE OPERATION WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE
OVER HOURS AGO.

30:25.660 --> 30:28.200
YEAH, I KNOW.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.250
SPENCER'S IN
GOOD HANDS, THOUGH.

30:32.460 --> 30:35.210
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT,

30:35.210 --> 30:38.380
SOMEONE TRIED TO
KILL MY SON, BILLY,

30:38.380 --> 30:41.300
AFTER ALL I'VE DONE
TO PROTECT HIM,

30:41.300 --> 30:43.470
EVERYTHING I'VE
SACRIFICED.

30:43.470 --> 30:45.180
MY BABY GOT SHOT!

30:47.850 --> 30:50.060
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?

30:50.060 --> 30:52.640
HEY, YOU HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING RIGHT
BY THIS BOY.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.400
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.280
IS THAT JUST OUR
CURSE AS A PEOPLE,

31:00.820 --> 31:03.820
IF YOU LOOK
HOW WE LOOK,

31:03.820 --> 31:07.410
IF YOU LIVE WHERE
WE LIVE?

31:07.410 --> 31:09.200
OR WHERE I LIVE.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.370
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU DO,

31:13.370 --> 31:16.380
WHAT YOU GIVE UP.

31:16.380 --> 31:19.670
ALL IT TAKES IS
ONE THUG,

31:19.670 --> 31:21.630
ONE GUN,

31:21.630 --> 31:23.340
AND A GRUDGE...

31:24.430 --> 31:26.300
TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY.

31:44.280 --> 31:47.030
SPENCER'S OUT OF SURGERY.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.160
DILLON: YES! YEAH.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.830
-MM!
-MM! HA HA.

31:52.830 --> 31:55.460
SLEEPING NOW, BUT ALL
THE EARLY INDICATIONS

31:55.460 --> 31:57.290
ARE POSITIVE.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.670
LAYLA: SO THE SURGERY
WAS A SUCCESS?

31:59.670 --> 32:03.300
DARNELL: SEE? I KNEW HE
WAS GONNA BE BACK BALLING
IN NO TIME, LITTLE MAN.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.880
WELL, THAT'S NOT--

32:06.470 --> 32:09.260
ALL THE FRAGMENTS OF
THE BULLET WERE REMOVED,

32:09.260 --> 32:12.350
SO IT WAS A SUCCESS
IN THAT SENSE,

32:12.350 --> 32:15.350
BUT DR. TAYLOR SAID
ASSESSING DAMAGE TO
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

32:15.350 --> 32:18.480
IS, UH, DIFFICULT.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.440
DILLON: SO WHEN
CAN WE SEE HIM?

32:21.440 --> 32:26.900
WELL, WE CAN SEE HOW
HE'S FEELING WHEN HE
WAKES UP. COME ON.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.280
LET'S GO.

32:31.670 --> 32:33.460
JORDAN:
PRINCIPAL LONDON,
COME ON.

32:33.460 --> 32:35.840
LONDON: I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.630
CANCEL THE MEETING,
OR AT LEAST RESCHEDULE
UNTIL MY DAD CAN COME.

32:38.630 --> 32:41.470
JORDAN, CLIFF MOSELY IS
AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF
THE BEVERLY HIGH COMMUNITY.

32:41.470 --> 32:43.800
THE BOARD WANTS
TO HEAR HIM OUT.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.970
IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS
TO KNOW WHAT MR. MOSELY'S
GONNA SAY IN THERE.

32:45.970 --> 32:47.600
I--I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ON OUR SIDE.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.680
LOOK, LOOK,
PRINCIPAL LONDON,

32:48.680 --> 32:50.850
DON'T LET THIS
HAPPEN, OK,

32:50.850 --> 32:52.650
NOT WHEN MY DAD HASN'T
LEFT THE HOSPITAL
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

32:52.650 --> 32:55.230
YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM
TO BE HERE WITH
EVERYTHING GOING ON.

32:55.230 --> 32:57.030
THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT,
JORDAN.

32:57.230 --> 32:59.190
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT.

32:59.190 --> 33:00.900
WITH ALL THAT YOUR
FAMILY'S GOING
THROUGH, IT'S BEST

33:00.900 --> 33:02.940
THAT HE AND YOU,
FOR THAT MATTER,

33:02.940 --> 33:05.030
PUT YOUR ENERGY
WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED.

33:05.030 --> 33:06.990
THAT'S AT THE HOSPITAL
AND AT HOME.

33:06.990 --> 33:10.450
IT'S BEST FOR THE TEAM,
AND IT'S BEST
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

33:10.450 --> 33:12.280
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
BUYING THIS BULL CRAP.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.040
THE BEVERLY EAGLES
NEED A COACH ABLE TO
FOCUS ON THE FIELD.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.870
RIGHT NOW YOUR FATHER
JUST ISN'T THAT MAN.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.670
PRINCIPAL LONDON.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.880
CLIFF: NOW, I GOT SOME
IDEAS THAT I THINK

33:23.880 --> 33:25.880
MIGHT BOOST THINGS UP
A LITTLE BIT.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.920
JJ: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

33:28.920 --> 33:32.050
JORDAN: ASHER, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING HERE?

33:32.050 --> 33:34.890
ASHER: SIMONE SAID
COACH NEEDED US.

33:34.890 --> 33:36.890
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.770
LONDON: EVERYBODY,
YOU MADE YOUR POINT,

33:38.770 --> 33:40.060
BUT THIS IS A MATTER
FOR THE BOARD NOW.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.440
NO, NO.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.480
BECAUSE WHAT CLIFF
DOESN'T GET IS

33:45.480 --> 33:48.690
BEING AN EAGLE DOESN'T
STOP WHEN THE WHISTLE
BLOWS, ALL RIGHT?

33:48.690 --> 33:50.700
WE SHOW UP FOR EACH OTHER
ON THE FIELD AND OFF.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.360
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONG,

33:52.360 --> 33:53.950
AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT MY
DAD IS DOING RIGHT NOW,

33:53.950 --> 33:55.950
PUTTING THE TEAM FIRST.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.700
CLIFF: SPENCER JAMES ISN'T
EVEN ON THE TEAM ANYMORE.
HE QUIT.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.710
ASHER: SPENCER JAMES IS
AN EAGLE, SIR.

34:00.710 --> 34:03.580
DOESN'T MATTER IF HE
EVER PICKS UP
A FOOTBALL AGAIN.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.250
JORDAN: YOU SEE, THAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
MY DAD AND YOU, CLIFF.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.000
HE STANDS UP
FOR HIS PLAYERS,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.550
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CAN'T
STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.090
SO WE'RE HERE TO STAND UP
FOR HIM, RIGHT?

34:11.090 --> 34:13.470
JJ: CAN I GET
A "HELL, YEAH"?

34:13.470 --> 34:15.180
EAGLES: HELL, YEAH!

34:19.350 --> 34:21.890
MAN, PREACH, COME ON.
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO BE GHOSTING ME.

34:21.890 --> 34:23.730
HIT ME BACK, MAN.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.030
YOU NEXT.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.790
SPENCER'S AWAKE!

34:58.760 --> 35:02.760
GREAT. AND THERE'S
NO TINGLING, EVEN
IN THE EXTREMITIES?

35:02.760 --> 35:07.140
SPENCER: NAH, IT FEELS GOOD.
DOES THAT MEAN IT WORKED?

35:07.140 --> 35:09.020
FULL SENSATION IS
A GREAT SIGN.

35:11.350 --> 35:14.600
TRY TO SQUEEZE MY HAND
IF YOU CAN.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.740
-IT'S NOT WORKING.
-TAKE A BREATH. TRY AGAIN.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.200
-I'M TRYING.
-IT'S OK.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.830
OK, THIS ISN'T UNEXPECTED.

35:27.830 --> 35:31.250
IT'S STILL VERY POSSIBLE
YOU'LL REGAIN
MUSCLE CONTROL IN TIME.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.250
NO, I CAN'T.
I NEED MY HANDS.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.040
EASY. YOU NEED
SOME REST.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.210
NO. COME ON.
I WANT TO TRY
AGAIN. COME ON!

35:37.210 --> 35:38.590
SPENCER? SPENCER, LOOK
AT ME. LOOK AT ME.

35:38.590 --> 35:40.380
BREATHE, BABY.
BREATHE.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.220
-I PROMISED YOU.
-NO, I KNOW.

35:42.220 --> 35:44.760
AND I KNOW YOU'LL
MAKE GOOD ON THAT
PROMISE,

35:44.760 --> 35:48.010
BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED
YOU OVERCOME IMPOSSIBLE
ODDS YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

35:48.010 --> 35:50.640
AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE ME
AND YOU HAVE DILLON

35:50.640 --> 35:54.690
AND YOU HAVE THE BAKERS
AND YOU HAVE A WHOLE MESS
OF PEOPLE BY YOUR SIDE,

35:54.690 --> 35:59.610
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS
TOGETHER.

35:59.610 --> 36:00.900
TOGETHER.

36:03.650 --> 36:06.240
I'D STILL LIKE TO TRY
ONE MORE TIME.

36:08.450 --> 36:10.700
OK. ONE MORE TIME.

36:10.700 --> 36:13.250
DON'T TRY TO PUSH YOURSELF.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.870
JUST TAKE
A DEEP BREATH, AND...

36:26.260 --> 36:27.890
TAYLOR: THERE IT IS.

36:27.890 --> 36:30.060
THAT-A BOY.

36:30.060 --> 36:31.470
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:44.060 --> 36:46.310
THANK YOU FOR
COMING.

36:49.550 --> 36:52.430
THERE'S NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS,
SO I'LL BE BRIEF.

36:52.430 --> 36:54.260
YOUR UTTER DISREGARD
FOR ONE OF OUR OWN IS

36:54.260 --> 36:56.560
NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF
THE BEVERLY HIGH COMMUNITY.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.640
AND IN A UNANIMOUS VOTE,
IT WAS DECIDED

36:58.640 --> 37:01.770
YOU WOULD STEP DOWN
FROM YOUR POSITION
AS LEAD BOOSTER.

37:01.770 --> 37:05.860
AND IN CASE THIS WASN'T
CLEAR, THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.

37:16.120 --> 37:19.240
I AM MAN ENOUGH
TO ADMIT WHEN
I'VE BEEN BESTED.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.040
YOU WON. BRAVO.

37:21.040 --> 37:24.170
THERE ARE NO WINNERS
OR LOSERS IN--

37:24.170 --> 37:26.170
IN THIS SCENARIO, CLIFF.

37:26.170 --> 37:28.300
THERE ALWAYS ARE.

37:28.300 --> 37:32.260
ALWAYS, WHICH IS WHY
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU

37:32.260 --> 37:34.680
THIS LITTLE PIECE
OF ADVICE.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.390
YOU WILL NEVER BE
ONE OF THEM--

37:37.390 --> 37:41.020
THE BOOSTERS,
THE BEVERLY ELITE.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.390
YOU'RE JUST A BOY FROM
THE HOOD PLAYING DRESS UP,

37:43.390 --> 37:47.020
AND THEY WILL NEVER
ACCEPT YOU THE WAY
THAT YOU REALLY WANT.

37:47.020 --> 37:50.110
WELL, THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG, CLIFF.

37:50.110 --> 37:52.610
I WAS NEVER CONFUSED
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO MATTER MOST.

37:52.610 --> 37:55.780
THE ONLY "THEM" I WANT TO
BE A PART OF IS

37:55.780 --> 37:59.160
THE THEM WHO SHOWED UP
FOR ME TODAY,

37:59.160 --> 38:01.160
MY TEAM.

38:04.290 --> 38:06.210
RIGHT.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.010
HEY.

38:23.310 --> 38:25.980
THANK YOU.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.860

38:48.630 --> 38:49.960
HEY.

38:52.550 --> 38:54.590

YOU SOMETHING.

38:54.590 --> 38:57.220
