00:06.068 --> 00:07.599
Will papa get better?

00:08.351 --> 00:10.132
Yeah. He will, yeah.

00:10.476 --> 00:11.563
He won't wake.

00:11.713 --> 00:12.799
I kept trying.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.237
How do you sleep at night?

00:14.388 --> 00:16.437
I support an entire village in Chiapas.

00:16.587 --> 00:18.634
- What do you do?
- What do I do for Mexico?

00:18.784 --> 00:20.317
Hey! Take it easy!

00:20.467 --> 00:23.112
There's millions of migrants working
on farms in this state.

00:23.262 --> 00:25.262
You can't turn it around
all by yourself.

00:29.309 --> 00:31.328
Tell them to send everything they have
and then...

00:31.656 --> 00:33.902
Oh God, are you okay? No, Bob.

00:34.052 --> 00:35.040
Just leave it.

00:36.582 --> 00:37.583
What's wrong Bob?

00:40.198 --> 00:41.941
Everything is fine Weston.

00:42.612 --> 00:44.746
If there's something wrong with my eyes,

00:45.583 --> 00:46.844
I can't do my job.

00:46.994 --> 00:49.157
And this lab, it's all that I have.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.610
I'm really scared, David.

Goddamn.

01:01.968 --> 01:03.071
More lightning.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.326
Spark a few more fires.

01:06.590 --> 01:08.741
I wish it would rain
with some of these storms.

01:11.849 --> 01:12.983
Shit, look!

01:20.748 --> 01:21.959
Is he alright?

01:22.936 --> 01:23.839
Jesus!

01:24.558 --> 01:26.210
What's on your face? Those aren't burns.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.913
What's wrong with your face?

01:44.349 --> 01:45.963
Hey, you talk to immigration?

01:46.113 --> 01:49.728
Yes. Elvia is back in Mexico
with her grandmother and cousins.

01:51.235 --> 01:53.116
That's what she wanted, right?

01:53.317 --> 01:54.997
That's all she had left.

01:58.524 --> 02:00.781
You still feel like hitting something?

02:05.934 --> 02:06.937
Yeah.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.128
You know, sometimes
I feel like the world is just...

02:10.312 --> 02:12.498
- pushing me into a corner.
- I hear that.

02:13.581 --> 02:16.452
Feel like ya gotta do
whatever ya gotta do to get out of it.

02:16.765 --> 02:17.768
Yeah.

02:18.702 --> 02:21.604
But assaulting a federal officer's not
the best way to go about it.

02:21.987 --> 02:23.554
I know that.

02:24.218 --> 02:25.146
Hey.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.114
You want the name of my therapist?

02:42.355 --> 02:43.353
Doctor Lowen?

02:43.503 --> 02:44.580
Right over there.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.821
Doctor Lowen?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.618
David SandstrÃ¶m. Carlos Serrano.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.834
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Alex.

02:50.984 --> 02:52.055
Thanks for coming.

02:52.205 --> 02:55.724
Your alert to the CDC got our attention,
so we take a first-hand look.

02:55.874 --> 02:58.183
Well normally, I'm dealing with
smoke inhalation,

02:58.339 --> 03:00.021
fatigue, dehydration, but this?

03:00.171 --> 03:02.211
- I don't know what to do.
- Can I have a look?

03:02.362 --> 03:04.644
- Yeah, please. Here.
- Thank you.

03:06.928 --> 03:08.733
Those aren't burns, are they?

03:10.188 --> 03:12.169
And they all came in
with these initial symptoms?

03:12.319 --> 03:16.145
Localized infections. Ulcerations.
Mostly of cuts and scratches.

03:16.295 --> 03:18.996
You get pretty dinged-up out there,
even in the protective gear.

03:19.146 --> 03:22.123
- Where're you keeping the sick?
- Down at a station house in Benton

03:22.273 --> 03:24.553
- about 5 clicks from here.
- They're all like that?

03:24.804 --> 03:26.208
It gets worse.

03:31.359 --> 03:34.061
Pneumonia,
infection in the lobes of the lungs.

03:34.211 --> 03:36.166
Looks like pulmonary abscesses as well.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.273
Those are a couple days old, from
the first guys who came down with it.

03:39.423 --> 03:40.413
How they doing?

03:40.585 --> 03:43.792
3 have developed septicemia,
19 others are at various stages,

03:43.946 --> 03:45.092
and 2 are dead.

03:45.388 --> 03:47.401
- You're treating them with?
- Mainly antibiotics.

03:47.551 --> 03:49.755
We're having a limited success
with tetracycline.

03:49.905 --> 03:52.146
So what makes you think
it's noncommunicable?

03:52.296 --> 03:54.363
Five firefighters
carried the sick to base camp.

03:54.513 --> 03:55.993
They're not showing any symptoms.

03:56.143 --> 03:58.070
Doesn't make you want
to break into song,

03:58.220 --> 03:59.736
but it's a little ray of sunshine.

03:59.954 --> 04:01.003
Any thoughts?

04:01.195 --> 04:04.123
We'll get some samples back to our lab
and have a look at them.

04:04.273 --> 04:06.290
I appreciate the help, guys.
The wind changes,

04:06.440 --> 04:08.627
we're gonna need
all the healthy bodies we can get.

04:09.062 --> 04:11.419
- How many are out there right now?
- Last count I heard

04:11.569 --> 04:13.033
was close to 600.

04:13.532 --> 04:14.785
<i>Doctor Lowen?</i>

04:15.641 --> 04:16.649
Lowen, go.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.048
<i>We got three more down, Doc.
In transport.</i>

04:20.526 --> 04:22.017

Left.

06:37.050 --> 06:38.053
Yeah.

06:39.828 --> 06:40.756
Thank you.

06:40.906 --> 06:42.806
You think therapy
might be a good idea?

06:42.956 --> 06:43.956
No.

06:44.366 --> 06:46.849
Cuz I got the number
of a really good one if you want it.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.698
I'm not comfort discussing
my personal affairs

06:49.848 --> 06:52.276
- with complete strangers.
- How else would you do it?

06:52.988 --> 06:55.176
I'd rather go
to confession.

06:56.106 --> 06:57.911
You in a closet
with a priest?

06:58.061 --> 06:59.200
I don't know.

07:00.624 --> 07:02.351
It's like having
a paid friend, you know.

07:02.501 --> 07:04.349
Somebody who gives you
what you need and then

07:04.501 --> 07:06.698
when your hour's up,
you don't have to see them again.

07:06.848 --> 07:08.152
Wait, that's a prostitute.

07:08.409 --> 07:09.536
- Is that it?
- Yes.

07:09.686 --> 07:11.185
Blood from the victims, by name

07:11.335 --> 07:13.563
- and date of exposure.
- Do a progressive comparison

07:13.713 --> 07:17.150
- from latest to earliest infection.
- Anything specific I'm looking for?

07:17.300 --> 07:18.830
We have to check for all viruses.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.442
Noncommunicable, pox-like lesions.
If you want to prioritize,

07:21.592 --> 07:23.327
- start with poxviruses.
- Got it.

07:25.462 --> 07:27.267
I'm not gonna force you to do it.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.035
But this can't become an issue.

07:29.185 --> 07:32.395
I'll give you my word. I'll never hit
another immigration officer again.

07:32.545 --> 07:34.874
I'm not saying that.
I mean, if the guy hits you first,

07:35.024 --> 07:37.871
or treats you like
that asshole did in California...

07:38.458 --> 07:40.163
Maybe I need to get back into therapy.

07:40.313 --> 07:42.250
- I'll give Rachel a hand.
- Alright.

07:44.401 --> 07:45.493
- David?
- Hey Wes,

07:45.643 --> 07:47.920
want a subscription to Bride's Magazine?

07:49.092 --> 07:51.570
B.C. called. Looks like it's spreading.

07:59.581 --> 08:01.086
Take a look at this.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.020
It's a map of the burn region.

08:04.957 --> 08:07.003
- What am I looking at?
- These are the 2 areas

08:07.153 --> 08:08.792
where they think the men were infected.

08:08.961 --> 08:10.246
That's pretty far apart.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.122
Nobody was infected anywhere in between?

08:13.272 --> 08:15.131
No. Two completely distinct areas.

08:15.281 --> 08:17.753
It's almost like they were
encountering pockets of something.

08:18.812 --> 08:19.830
Shit.

08:21.352 --> 08:22.543
Okay, thanks Wes.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.515
Hey Bob. How'd it go?

08:45.671 --> 08:46.775
- Fine.
- Fine?

08:47.078 --> 08:49.009
- Fine. Bob?
- They don't know yet.

08:49.381 --> 08:50.520
Come on.

08:53.017 --> 08:56.248
I have high intra-ocular pressure
and an increased cup-to-disc ratio.

08:56.398 --> 08:58.955
The optic nerve in both eyes
is degenerating.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.555
It's progressive and irreversible.

09:01.705 --> 09:03.424
- Okay.
- Stage 3 glaucoma.

09:04.249 --> 09:05.522
Ah, okay.

09:06.095 --> 09:07.673
They're putting me on a cocktail.

09:07.944 --> 09:08.836
Eye drops.

09:10.152 --> 09:11.205
They won't work.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.820
I'm going blind, David. I'm sorry.

09:15.071 --> 09:17.294
Sorry, why?
We're not gonna let this happen, Bob.

09:17.444 --> 09:19.494
I was thinking
I should take a leave of absence.

09:19.644 --> 09:20.659
Stop, alright?

09:21.138 --> 09:23.663
Well, I just don't trust myself anymore.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.768
You know, what if I drop something or...

09:25.998 --> 09:27.781
If you're worried
about bench work, okay,

09:27.931 --> 09:30.394
we'll get a trained fucking supermonkey
to do that crap.

09:30.544 --> 09:31.786
What I want is your mind.

09:31.936 --> 09:33.526
Okay? Your thoughts.

09:34.233 --> 09:35.656
We'll work this through.

09:37.986 --> 09:39.206
Yeah, fine.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.046
- Craig!
- Mom!

09:47.196 --> 09:49.218
Oh. What are you doing here?

09:49.368 --> 09:50.933
I am on my way up to Algonquin.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.018
I was gonna call
but I don't have your numbers.

09:53.168 --> 09:55.360
Yes, you do.
I emailed them to you last week.

09:55.510 --> 09:56.882
They were in my cell phone.

09:57.042 --> 10:00.387
- You lost another cell phone?
- Nice new digs. Very nice.

10:00.537 --> 10:02.726
Yeah. Come on, I'll show you around.

10:10.104 --> 10:13.514
Great. Just what I need.
Blackberry spam.

10:13.664 --> 10:16.371
- Hey David, this is my son, Craig.
- Hey, how's it going?

10:16.521 --> 10:18.339
- Good.
- You'll have time to visit later.

10:18.489 --> 10:21.796
Your mom's got some PCRs to get running.
This thing is getting out of control.

10:21.946 --> 10:23.616
- We really need to get on it.
- Okay.

10:23.766 --> 10:26.607
- I've got to go back to work.
- I just stopped by to say I was here.

10:26.757 --> 10:28.263
Oh perfect! Mayko!

10:28.604 --> 10:31.385
This is Mayko.
This is Rachel's son, Greg.

10:31.535 --> 10:32.857
Show him a good time.

10:33.016 --> 10:35.619
- But we'll meet for dinner, right?
- Anything but Persian.

10:35.956 --> 10:38.648
- It's nice to meet you, Greg.
- Actually, it's Craig.

10:39.119 --> 10:41.012
- I am her son, though.
- Sorry.

10:41.162 --> 10:44.974
You met the genius who runs this place.

10:45.964 --> 10:49.057
- So what do you have against Persian?
- Just the food.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.460
Mayko, I need to look at this blood.
I can't find a tech.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.852
I'll do it. Put it there.

10:54.010 --> 10:55.588
- 15 others to prep.
- Sure.

10:57.039 --> 10:58.869
Carlos Serrano. Rachel's son, Craig.

10:59.523 --> 11:00.972
Nice to meet you.

11:01.153 --> 11:02.865
- Same.
- Just visiting?

11:03.156 --> 11:04.532
Actually, in transit.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.125
- Going where?
- Algonquin park.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.093
Studying aggressive bear behaviour
up there.

11:09.243 --> 11:12.492
- Are you a zoologist?
- Doing post-grad studies.

11:12.794 --> 11:13.844
Interesting.

11:14.564 --> 11:16.549
- I better get back to work.
- Everyone's busy.

11:16.699 --> 11:18.729
- ASAP, Mayko.
- Got it.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.545
- Wanna check it out?
- Yeah.

11:22.341 --> 11:24.638
Really, I didn't know
that bears were aggressive.

11:24.788 --> 11:25.975
Typically, they aren't.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.557
So then what's causing it?

11:28.196 --> 11:29.343
I don't know.

11:29.632 --> 11:32.110
It could be shrinking habitat
causing competition for food.

11:32.260 --> 11:33.792
Could be something epidemiological.

11:33.942 --> 11:37.281
- Could be something genetic, I suppose.
- I actually read...

11:37.987 --> 11:40.470
an article not that long ago
written by a team at NCU.

11:40.620 --> 11:44.228
And they had identified 15 genes
that affected aggressive behaviour.

11:44.378 --> 11:46.390
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah.

11:48.269 --> 11:49.746
Here, have a look at this one.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.979
So, which of these bacteria
is the bad guy?

11:54.384 --> 11:55.912
That's the mystery.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.888
You know what, it is so weird
up there. Even the fires.

11:59.038 --> 12:02.454
Like, I was doing field
work over by Bella Coola and I'm...

12:02.679 --> 12:04.730
I'm taking up
too much of your time right now.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.829
Could you tell mom
I will see her at dinner?

12:06.983 --> 12:09.877
- It's fine, you don't have to leave.
- No, no. You're busy.

12:10.721 --> 12:13.584
- I'll see you soon though, right?
- Yeah. Bye.

12:21.896 --> 12:24.289
So these are images
of the firefighter's blood.

12:24.576 --> 12:28.047
Based on 16S ribosomal RNA analysis,
it's Burkholderia Mallei.

12:28.505 --> 12:31.631
- Commonly known as glanders.
<i>- I'm not familiar with it.</i>

12:31.781 --> 12:33.551
- It's a horse disease?
- That's it.

12:33.701 --> 12:36.555
Also carried by donkeys, mules,
almost anything equine.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.597
- But extremely rare.
- Virtually unknown in North America.

12:39.747 --> 12:41.568
There's been what?
One reported human case

12:41.718 --> 12:43.583
- in the last 60 years.
- So why the comeback?

12:43.733 --> 12:45.237
<i>First tell me how to treat it.</i>

12:45.387 --> 12:46.643
It's not easy.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.228
Usually recommended treatment
is a combination

12:49.378 --> 12:51.911
- of imipenem and doxycycline.
<i>- Okay.</i>

12:52.398 --> 12:53.711
So how does it end up here?

12:53.861 --> 12:57.526
It's usually aerosol transmission
between an infected animal and a human.

12:57.821 --> 12:59.978
Horses? Mules?
There's no ranching up here.

13:00.537 --> 13:02.360
What about a wild herd?

13:02.510 --> 13:04.685
Infected animal dies. Goes up in smoke.

13:04.835 --> 13:07.414
Firefighters breathe it in,
or it infects an open lesion?

13:07.575 --> 13:09.665
- It's possible.
- Maybe.

13:11.656 --> 13:12.367
But?

13:12.934 --> 13:14.243
I gotta check something out.

13:18.461 --> 13:20.788
Remember I said I needed
that super cranium of yours?

13:20.942 --> 13:23.133
- David, you don't have to do this.
- I need it now.

13:23.306 --> 13:25.215
- What do you want?
- Dig up everything you can

13:25.384 --> 13:26.525
for me on glanders.

13:26.682 --> 13:30.300
- Am I looking for anything specific?
- Yeah, weaponization.

13:37.589 --> 13:39.499
Nice to meet you, Dr. Serrano.

13:39.712 --> 13:41.645
Carlos. You too, Craig.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.336
So you're into martial arts?

13:46.224 --> 13:49.617
Yeah, I find it's a, you know,
good way to let off some steam.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.133
I just don't get to the gym
often enough.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.805
- I spar a bit myself.
- Oh really?

13:58.186 --> 14:00.803
I'm always looking
for a good sparring partner.

14:02.732 --> 14:05.429
Sounds good. So, later.

14:06.781 --> 14:07.972
Yeah, sure.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.008
What'd you find out, Bob?

14:29.166 --> 14:30.792
It's really quite fascinating.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.785
Glanders is one of the oldest forms
of biological weapon.

14:33.964 --> 14:34.971
Yeah?

14:35.162 --> 14:36.093
In early times,

14:36.243 --> 14:39.869
horses infected with it were placed
in the enemy's cavalry to destroy it.

14:40.061 --> 14:42.244
- In World War One...
- Bring it up to today, Bob.

14:42.401 --> 14:43.977
It's still present in the 3rd world.

14:44.127 --> 14:46.326
There have been rare cases
of lab workers

14:46.495 --> 14:48.609
and veterinary personnel
becoming infected.

14:48.759 --> 14:51.593
- What about its use as a weapon?
- It's believed the Soviets used it

14:51.743 --> 14:54.662
- against the Afghanis in the 80s.
- Any terrorists using it these days?

14:54.812 --> 14:57.316
No confirmed proof.
But, glanders is a good candidate.

14:58.271 --> 15:01.260
It's readily spread,
especially in aerosol form.

15:01.869 --> 15:03.699
And patients don't develop immunity.

15:03.867 --> 15:06.878
So it can be used on the same population
over and over again. Nice.

15:07.103 --> 15:10.272
And because it is so rarely seen, no one
has ever bothered to make a vaccine.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.549
You mean, there was no money
to be made making a vaccine.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.736
That's a cynical conclusion.

15:16.159 --> 15:17.843
- What?
<i>- Dr. SandstrÃ¶m?</i>

15:18.080 --> 15:19.502
- It's Alex Lowen.
- Yeah.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.322
I got people coming in here
with something that isn't glanders.

15:22.476 --> 15:23.943
What are they presenting?

15:24.146 --> 15:28.406
Smaller blisters, black in the centre,
surrounded by redness and swelling.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.351
You know what you're describing, right?

15:30.501 --> 15:31.489
Yeah.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.524
Anthrax.

15:33.110 --> 15:35.335
What the hell's going on up here?

15:35.712 --> 15:37.668
Dots represent the areas
where the firefighters

15:37.818 --> 15:40.862
most likely contracted the glanders.
The crosses represent the anthrax.

15:41.012 --> 15:42.779
Both associated with biological weapons.

15:42.929 --> 15:44.945
So, what are we looking at? An attack?

15:45.243 --> 15:47.351
Well, both can be naturally occurring.

15:47.512 --> 15:50.444
Doctor Lowen acknowledged that the
glanders could have come from animals.

15:50.597 --> 15:53.183
And anthrax spores lie dormant
in the forest for decades.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.627
But there's only been one outbreak
of glanders in the last 6 decades.

15:56.777 --> 15:59.594
Yeah, and now it shows up at
the same time as an anthrax outbreak.

15:59.843 --> 16:02.983
Doesn't sound very likely. So what
other possible explanations are there?

16:03.349 --> 16:06.232
It could be some clandestine germ
warfare lab goes up in the fire.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.856
I talked to Homeland Security
about that. If there was a lab,

16:09.006 --> 16:11.882
- it wasn't American or Canadian.
- How can you be sure of that?

16:12.032 --> 16:15.144
The American government has been less
than truthful with us before, Weston.

16:15.469 --> 16:18.651
The Americans have the best
germ lab in the world at Fort Egan.

16:18.804 --> 16:22.279
- Why wouldn't they just do it there?
- And Canada has no germ program.

16:22.429 --> 16:23.404
So they say.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.753
My problem with that is
the dispersal pattern.

16:26.907 --> 16:30.162
With a single lab, we'd have a central
source. These are all over the place.

16:31.037 --> 16:32.792
More like they've been planted.

16:33.281 --> 16:34.751
- Yeah.
- But that would mean

16:34.901 --> 16:37.171
somebody would have
had to have known about the fire.

16:38.011 --> 16:39.152
It was set.

16:40.734 --> 16:41.962
You're talking terrorism.

16:42.112 --> 16:44.389
Yeah, Wes. That's exactly
what we're talking.

16:46.234 --> 16:47.458
And the forest,

16:47.946 --> 16:49.583
it's a massive biological weapon.

16:51.737 --> 16:53.676
Come on, we gotta make a phone call.

16:55.670 --> 16:57.175
If this is terrorism,

16:57.325 --> 16:59.530
the question is how are
the pathogens being deployed?

16:59.684 --> 17:02.351
With biological weapons they
have an aerosol-based delivery system.

17:02.505 --> 17:04.430
In this case, there's no explosion,
no flybys.

17:04.584 --> 17:07.281
- The fire is the delivery system.
- How's that?

17:07.434 --> 17:09.742
The bacteria gets picked up
by the convection of the fire

17:09.892 --> 17:11.314
and then carried by the smoke.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.867
Firefighters get in contact with the
air currents. The wounds get infected.

17:15.017 --> 17:17.112
They take off their masks,
they inhale the bacteria,

17:17.262 --> 17:19.939
it gestates in the lungs and
attacks the pulmonary system.

17:20.102 --> 17:21.887
Why firefighters
in the middle of nowhere?

17:22.038 --> 17:24.848
Maybe it was a test run.
Every infected firefighter is new data.

17:25.035 --> 17:27.632
- Should I give Riddlemeyer an update?
- Yep.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.591
- Can we prove it?
- Jesus, Wes.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.955
Work with me here.
That's what this is all about.

17:33.109 --> 17:35.583
I need some ammo
when I call Riddlemeyer.

17:36.435 --> 17:39.561
Okay. If those firefighters
do have anthrax,

17:39.711 --> 17:42.062
they were exposed to the anthrax
in its spore stage.

17:42.214 --> 17:44.819
So we need to send somebody
to B.C. to get a sample of it.

17:45.076 --> 17:45.882
Why?

17:46.033 --> 17:48.893
Because you can learn a lot
about the makers from those spores.

17:49.043 --> 17:51.471
- Maybe even enough to catch them.
- How's that?

17:51.760 --> 17:52.768
Okay.

17:56.378 --> 17:58.958
It takes a lot of anthrax
to infect a human being.

17:59.108 --> 18:02.344
So, if you wanna use it was a weapon,
you've gotta grow a lot of anthrax.

18:02.494 --> 18:05.251
You need a growth medium.
Now when you go to extract

18:05.401 --> 18:08.763
the wet spores from the medium,
you get a lot of clumping problems.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.559
The medium leaves
a residue on the spores.

18:11.709 --> 18:15.081
We could trace the chemical makeup
of that medium back to a specific lab.

18:15.282 --> 18:18.541
Also, different labs use different
chemicals to separate the spores.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.684
And once you get
the spores out of the medium,

18:21.855 --> 18:25.058
you gotta dry them off.
There's air, freeze-drying, and heat.

18:25.212 --> 18:27.944
Some of the spores might show signs
of the process used,

18:28.094 --> 18:31.214
also pointing back to a specific lab.
And lastly, you've gotta mill it,

18:31.364 --> 18:33.298
so that it's small enough
to infect the lung.

18:34.201 --> 18:37.201
We're looking at a size somewhere
underneath 5 microns. Okay?

18:37.503 --> 18:38.473
Class dismissed.

18:39.799 --> 18:41.048
A long shot, David.

18:41.651 --> 18:43.062
You got a better idea?

18:43.454 --> 18:44.259
No.

18:46.722 --> 18:50.474
We need a spore sample, Wes.
I'll bring you back a Sasquatch.

18:51.247 --> 18:52.937
- David, there's something else.
- What?

18:53.087 --> 18:55.829
The FBI received an anonymous call.
Something about...

18:56.106 --> 18:57.952
a smiley face you might have received.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.887
The FBI is investigating
smiley faces now?

19:01.168 --> 19:02.814
They're taking this seriously.

19:17.695 --> 19:18.828
Something like this?

19:25.620 --> 19:26.629
Don't!

19:30.843 --> 19:33.644
I will let you know if it is anything
to be concerned about.

19:34.404 --> 19:35.409
Okay.

19:36.196 --> 19:37.010
And Wes...

19:38.553 --> 19:40.993
Anthrax vaccinations for those
firefighters ASAP.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.136
Alright.

20:08.160 --> 20:08.966
Tap.

20:14.206 --> 20:15.010
Quick.

20:15.482 --> 20:18.229
Not bad for an old man, eh?
Two out of three?

20:19.105 --> 20:20.117
Okay.

20:57.088 --> 20:58.559
I better get that.

21:15.015 --> 21:18.195
Okay, if we're gonna find some of these
spores, we'll wanna look right here.

21:18.349 --> 21:20.207
Where your guys likely
contracted the anthrax.

21:20.357 --> 21:21.813
That area was already burnt over.

21:21.963 --> 21:25.459
Well, anthrax is so goddamn
tough it can survive even a fire.

21:25.609 --> 21:28.330
I'd like to look for spores on
the infected men's protective gear.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.438
Good idea.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.624
Okay, so, what about us?

21:32.258 --> 21:35.748
Well, we need samples,
so I need a guide.

21:36.448 --> 21:38.107
I guess that'd be me.

21:39.151 --> 21:40.696
CSIS didn't want to take any chances

21:40.846 --> 21:44.472
with the package that was sent to David,
so I had it shipped out and x-rayed.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.507
What do you make of that?

21:48.390 --> 21:51.884
It's hard to tell what might be
in that vial from an X-ray, but...

21:52.136 --> 21:53.102
Room 702?

21:53.988 --> 21:56.550
- What time?
- I'll be there around ten.

21:57.308 --> 21:58.160
Okay, ten.

22:02.768 --> 22:05.263
What should I do with that?
Irradiate it?

22:06.250 --> 22:07.823
I'll take care of it.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.225
Well, that doesn't work.

22:20.829 --> 22:21.838
You're...

22:22.007 --> 22:23.366
You're gonna need this.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.606
Okay.

22:28.404 --> 22:29.422
Could you?

22:29.690 --> 22:32.916
You've never been on the front line
of a forest fire, have you?

22:33.069 --> 22:34.280
It's a first.

22:34.702 --> 22:36.638
Well, listen to your walkie.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.141
And know what the fire
is doing at all times.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.343
'Cause a doctor,
or a molecular biologist,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.279
you're no help to anyone
if you get caught in a burnover.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.522
Burnover?

22:46.935 --> 22:48.328
Yeah, a burnover.

22:48.655 --> 22:50.811
Basically everything is
suddenly engulfed in flames.

22:50.961 --> 22:52.341
And the thing is,

22:52.841 --> 22:55.104
you think the fire is
under control one second,

22:55.254 --> 22:56.925
and the next...

22:57.905 --> 22:59.163
you're in hell.

22:59.432 --> 23:01.792
Okay. Avoid burnover. Got it.

23:05.658 --> 23:06.984
Avoid burnover.

24:07.187 --> 24:09.140
Yeah, I think you better see this.

24:11.785 --> 24:12.928
Whaddya got?

24:18.935 --> 24:21.399
I'm gonna run it again. Let's make sure.

24:23.580 --> 24:26.604
Those samples will make it back fine on
their own. You don't have to go.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.122
I prefer to put them
onto the chopper myself.

24:29.285 --> 24:31.182
A cold one will wait
for you when you get back.

24:31.332 --> 24:32.336
Right.

24:35.977 --> 24:38.946
- What the hell is going on here, Doc?
- We don't know yet.

24:39.486 --> 24:41.704
I got a buddy, Jeremy Williamson.

24:41.990 --> 24:45.166
- He's not doing too well right now.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

24:45.501 --> 24:46.720
What do we tell his wife?

24:46.870 --> 24:48.914
We're working as hard
and as fast as we can.

24:49.064 --> 24:51.094
Sure,
but if you don't figure this out soon,

24:51.244 --> 24:54.216
you're not going to be able
to have anyone go close to that fire.

25:04.187 --> 25:07.151
Those samples will make it back fine on
their own. You don't have to go.

25:07.301 --> 25:09.217
I prefer to put them
on the chopper personally.

25:09.367 --> 25:11.273
A cold one will wait
for you when you get back.

25:11.423 --> 25:12.427
Right.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.604
Brought you a beer.

25:39.345 --> 25:40.205
Thanks.

25:40.587 --> 25:41.701
Where's yours?

25:42.236 --> 25:43.697
I'm taking a break.

25:45.029 --> 25:47.389
- Mind if I join you?
- Yeah, have a seat.

25:51.823 --> 25:53.797
So how're you doing? You alright?

25:54.915 --> 25:55.926
Yeah.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.134
- It sorta hit me since you got here.
- What's that?

25:59.350 --> 26:01.170
You know, that we're under attack.

26:01.642 --> 26:03.472
Someone's intentionally doing this.

26:04.381 --> 26:06.231
Killing people. Why?

26:06.381 --> 26:09.046
What the hell kind of person
does something like that?

26:09.577 --> 26:11.502
We'll probably read
in the newspaper next week

26:11.652 --> 26:14.557
it was some asshole with a hard-on
against the colour of fire trucks.

26:14.715 --> 26:19.138
It's just that getting caught up in a
plan that has nothing to do with you...

26:21.976 --> 26:23.520
I know how you feel.

26:26.098 --> 26:28.730
Couldn't have asked for
a more beautiful night though?

26:29.434 --> 26:32.044
It'd be more beautiful if it rained
like this for another 4 days

26:32.194 --> 26:33.681
and killed the fire.

26:35.592 --> 26:37.929
Sorry. I'm just making conversation.

26:41.211 --> 26:42.566
So why don't you hit on me?

26:44.925 --> 26:46.077
Do you want me to?

26:47.683 --> 26:49.025
You're avoiding the question.

26:51.205 --> 26:52.363
I'm taking a break.

26:54.413 --> 26:55.607
For their sake or yours?

26:57.459 --> 26:59.084
You didn't answer my question.

27:03.663 --> 27:04.663
Yes.

27:06.436 --> 27:07.735
But I'm married.

27:07.885 --> 27:09.675
You're not wearing a band.

27:10.899 --> 27:12.630
So you thought about it?

27:15.246 --> 27:17.731
Sometimes it's good to just have a pal.

27:23.113 --> 27:24.531
You better answer that.

27:28.873 --> 27:30.144
Excuse me.

27:31.621 --> 27:32.535
What?

27:32.685 --> 27:35.468
We got the results on the package
that was delivered to you.

27:37.433 --> 27:38.710
David, it's smallpox.

27:38.878 --> 27:41.884
- That's impossible. You made a mistake.
- No mistake.

27:42.152 --> 27:45.272
Fuck, Rachel. Smallpox
was eradicated in 1980.

27:45.671 --> 27:49.764
1979, but both the Russian and
American military still have stockpiles.

27:50.223 --> 27:53.245
I guess somebody's got a big,
bad security problem?

27:53.395 --> 27:54.815
So who would send it to you?

27:55.904 --> 27:57.475
You want an alphabetical list?

27:57.891 --> 27:59.823
Anthrax and glanders on the west coast

27:59.990 --> 28:02.643
and now smallpox on the east.
I think this is bigger than NorBAC.

28:02.948 --> 28:06.004
Actually, this is exactly why NorBAC
was put together in the first place.

28:06.154 --> 28:09.095
Have Wes book me
the first flight home tomorrow morning.

28:17.223 --> 28:20.640
Sorry but as soon as the samples get in,
it's gonna get even worse around here.

28:20.790 --> 28:23.326
Mam, I'll stop by on the way
back from the park.

28:23.481 --> 28:25.428
- Do you promise?
- Yes, I promise.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.638
- Okay.
- I'll sign myself out.

28:28.436 --> 28:29.437
Okay.

28:30.048 --> 28:31.407
- You be careful?
- You too.

28:31.557 --> 28:32.555
Okay.

28:34.168 --> 28:35.201
See ya.

28:35.751 --> 28:38.266
Wow, that was quick.
Did he have a good time?

28:38.820 --> 28:41.115
I guess so.
He didn't come home the other night.

28:41.283 --> 28:42.677
You were there to know?

28:43.447 --> 28:44.570
I was, yeah.

28:51.069 --> 28:51.772
Craig.

28:52.434 --> 28:53.468
Hi, dad.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.046
What brings you here?

28:56.226 --> 28:57.866
That's funny... mom.

28:58.631 --> 29:00.615
- Why else would I come here?
- Of course.

29:01.545 --> 29:02.686
So how're you doing?

29:02.977 --> 29:05.176
- Can we not play this game?
- Just asking how you are.

29:05.505 --> 29:07.251
I know. I'm just telling you,

29:07.581 --> 29:08.948
I don't wanna talk.

29:11.759 --> 29:14.171
- You've made your mind up about me.
- So trite.

29:17.352 --> 29:18.777
Just give me a reason.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.050
You.

29:22.906 --> 29:24.466
Washington. Missy.

29:25.429 --> 29:26.665
That's three.

29:27.137 --> 29:29.070
Now go fuck yourself, okay?

29:44.892 --> 29:47.158
We've tracked
the text message David received.

29:47.332 --> 29:50.807
It was sent from a prepaid cell phone,
purchased from a kiosk in Peoria.

29:50.957 --> 29:54.390
The cell phone company traced the
message it was sent from Columbus, Ohio.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.973
Well, who is behind
this knows David's cell number.

29:57.140 --> 29:58.999
Security and IT
figure out how that happened.

29:59.149 --> 30:01.030
It might be
a business card he handed out.

30:01.180 --> 30:03.221
It's our only way of
connecting this person, right?

30:03.374 --> 30:04.748
They've made no other contact.

30:04.902 --> 30:08.196
I'm sure David won't mind the FBI
monitoring his phone and the internet.

30:08.346 --> 30:10.069
He's convinced they already are.

30:14.378 --> 30:15.252
Bob.

30:15.540 --> 30:18.500
- Samples from the fire get here?
- Rachel's already working on them.

30:18.659 --> 30:21.322
David, I was thinking
while you were gone.

30:21.477 --> 30:23.498
Well, since anthrax
stays in its spore stage

30:23.648 --> 30:25.519
for so long, for decades,
it's slow evolving.

30:25.669 --> 30:28.168
- So its genetic heritage is clear.
- What are you thinking?

30:28.318 --> 30:30.840
Perhaps the genetic markers
might give us a clue

30:30.990 --> 30:32.840
as to its geographic origin.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.635
Great idea, Bob. You get Mayko on it?

30:34.892 --> 30:35.950
Sure.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.656
- Have a good meeting.
- Thank you.

30:39.574 --> 30:42.665
I was just telling Weston how this whole
thing has turned into a shit storm.

30:42.815 --> 30:43.816
What's up?

30:43.996 --> 30:47.531
The Russians are denying that
they're the source of the smallpox.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.726
CIA has been telling us for years...

30:49.876 --> 30:53.521
I know the argument. Some lab tech sells
a smallpox sample for a crate of vodka,

30:53.684 --> 30:56.864
David. I think Mr. Riddlemeyer is just
expressing Washington's position.

30:57.217 --> 30:58.790
What is Washington's position?

30:59.161 --> 31:01.897
General Samuel at Fort Egan
personally assures me

31:02.047 --> 31:04.284
that their security
has not been compromised.

31:04.434 --> 31:06.533
You expected him
to tell you differently?

31:07.014 --> 31:09.598
Which is why we want you
to determine the source of the virus.

31:09.983 --> 31:12.338
So? If we determine
which lab is the source,

31:12.494 --> 31:15.201
- we'll be hot on his trail?
- Reasonable course, don't you agree?

31:15.490 --> 31:17.254
What about the anthrax and the glanders?

31:17.404 --> 31:19.915
- Do they think they're related?
- Hard to imagine they're not.

31:21.289 --> 31:22.673
Vaccine. Are we making it?

31:23.709 --> 31:26.915
Samples of the smallpox are
en route from both Russia and Fort Egan.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.846
I suggest you get ready
for their arrival.

31:28.999 --> 31:32.378
You didn't answer my question.
Are they making vaccine?

31:36.450 --> 31:37.450
Yes.

31:38.929 --> 31:41.571
I guess the real question
is who's gonna get it?

31:43.703 --> 31:45.488
May I use your office, Weston?

31:46.069 --> 31:47.069
Yes.

31:57.352 --> 31:59.432
Well, as soon as they
finish sequencing the anthrax,

31:59.582 --> 32:01.477
I'll see what those
DNA markers can tell us.

32:01.707 --> 32:03.488
- Thanks, Mayko.
- Bob.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.489
How are you feeling?

32:06.549 --> 32:08.634
- Actually, I'm feeling a little better.
- Yeah?

32:10.694 --> 32:12.379
Have you noticed that...

32:12.755 --> 32:13.949
Oh God, never mind.

32:14.263 --> 32:15.769
What? Noticed what?

32:16.579 --> 32:19.099
No, just Wes and Rachel.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.370
- What about 'em?
- Well they're...

32:23.704 --> 32:25.954
Never mind. Sorry, Bob.

32:27.798 --> 32:29.413
Okay. Thanks.

32:39.639 --> 32:40.639
Any updates?

32:40.789 --> 32:43.972
Three more glanders infections.
Six more anthrax. One didn't make it.

32:44.158 --> 32:45.700
- Shit.
- There's something else.

32:45.860 --> 32:46.871
Great.

32:47.659 --> 32:50.274
Long-term weather models
suggest that high winds may be coming.

32:50.430 --> 32:52.358
And that wind's gonna
blow the smoke somewhere.

32:52.508 --> 32:55.169
Where is anyone's guess.
Want you to keep a close eye on it.

32:55.319 --> 32:56.420
Any good news?

32:56.751 --> 32:58.767
Well, the rest of the
anthrax vaccine did arrive.

32:58.923 --> 33:00.492
Well, that's something.

33:01.156 --> 33:02.376
Hang in there.

33:14.181 --> 33:15.441
She's very good.

33:16.042 --> 33:18.354
Second-best virologist
I've ever worked with.

33:18.843 --> 33:21.947
- Wouldn't have hired her if she wasn't.
- What exactly is she doing?

33:23.478 --> 33:26.535
She's doing a genetic
alignment comparison.

33:28.178 --> 33:29.230
How does that work?

33:30.870 --> 33:31.878
Well...

33:33.027 --> 33:37.840
In order to identify the original virus
as smallpox, we had to sequence it.

33:39.630 --> 33:43.526
185 000 nucleotides
in the smallpox DNA sequence.

33:44.362 --> 33:46.820
There are 400 strains of smallpox.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.950
Each one of them has been sequenced,

33:49.100 --> 33:51.296
and each of those sequences
is stored in the...

33:51.446 --> 33:52.706
World Gene Bank.

33:53.589 --> 33:56.185
So, this is available to the public?

33:56.440 --> 33:58.791
Oh yeah. It's accessible to everyone.

34:00.502 --> 34:01.502
Now,

34:02.084 --> 34:05.255
each of the strain's sequences are...
slightly different.

34:05.405 --> 34:08.161
The nucleotide is in a different
position at some point.

34:08.619 --> 34:12.434
So what Rachel is doing is lining up
the sequence of our guy's strain

34:12.583 --> 34:16.443
and comparing it to the sequences of
the strains sent from Russia and the US.

34:17.565 --> 34:20.387
Genetic alignment comparison.

34:20.771 --> 34:23.054
She'll be able to
tell us where it came from.

34:23.225 --> 34:25.268
And the anthrax and glanders?

34:25.782 --> 34:29.447
Well, there are no military stockpiles
of glanders, as you know.

34:29.598 --> 34:31.485
So there's no real point
taking a look at that.

34:31.635 --> 34:33.712
But the anthrax
we should be able to trace.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.783
Just like that Ames Strain of anthrax

34:35.933 --> 34:37.938
that was sent to Senator Daschle
awhile back.

34:38.088 --> 34:40.735
- That was stolen...
- From the US army.

34:41.719 --> 34:43.505
- Unproven.
- We'll see.

34:43.656 --> 34:45.751
We're already running tests on it.

35:10.867 --> 35:12.252
Do you want some?

35:12.534 --> 35:13.542
Herbal.

35:14.634 --> 35:15.776
Since when?

35:16.380 --> 35:19.253
Since I started going
to my nutritionist.

35:20.858 --> 35:21.863
Okay.

35:23.399 --> 35:24.743
How's it going?

35:27.862 --> 35:29.864
It's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

35:30.014 --> 35:34.726
I've got 2 other labs and 4 universities
working with me around the clock.

35:35.963 --> 35:38.509
And still we're only
a third of the way through.

35:38.778 --> 35:40.827
It's impressive nonetheless.

35:41.403 --> 35:44.327
That's one of those things
you never really know about someone.

35:45.617 --> 35:47.183
You mean take for granted?

35:48.965 --> 35:49.973
Perhaps.

35:52.642 --> 35:54.525
Sensitive. Herbal tea.

35:54.842 --> 35:57.399
- What, you turning over a new leaf?
- Maybe.

35:59.474 --> 36:00.795
Maybe too late.

36:02.045 --> 36:03.127
But I'm trying.

36:10.276 --> 36:13.245
- Craig was here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw him. Briefly.

36:15.788 --> 36:19.583
- You two should really work this out.
- Wanna have dinner, just you and me?

36:20.385 --> 36:22.087
You still like Persian?

36:28.214 --> 36:29.016
No.

36:30.945 --> 36:31.973
Seeing someone?

36:36.240 --> 36:37.330
What do you want?

36:38.841 --> 36:40.831
I want you to sign those papers.

36:44.909 --> 36:45.916
I see.

36:47.931 --> 36:50.554
- Is there some kind of rush?
- Missy's pregnant.

36:53.595 --> 36:55.031
- You mean Melissa?
- Yes.

36:55.181 --> 36:56.821
You knocked up your trainer?

37:03.345 --> 37:04.721
You were actually fucking her?

37:06.277 --> 37:07.732
Oh Carl.

37:08.246 --> 37:09.254
Come on.

37:10.125 --> 37:11.669
I mean, great body.

37:12.199 --> 37:14.008
What's she gonna do at the ranch?

37:14.497 --> 37:17.148
I can just see her doing
squats with George and Laura.

37:17.327 --> 37:18.919
- You all done?
- No.

37:20.442 --> 37:21.587
Do you love her?

37:22.611 --> 37:24.085
Just sign the papers.

37:26.456 --> 37:28.874
You know, I'm actually happy for you.

37:30.266 --> 37:32.561
Because you've got a second chance.

37:34.775 --> 37:36.723
Don't blow it with this kid.

37:47.402 --> 37:50.948
<i>Where the forest fires in B.C.
continue to rage out of control.</i>

37:51.864 --> 37:54.886
<i>And a 14th firefighter
has died fighting the blaze.</i>

38:29.296 --> 38:32.433
<i>No immediate threat to the greater
Vancouver Metropolitan area...</i>

40:03.165 --> 40:05.090
It's not gonna happen, Bob.

40:05.588 --> 40:06.752
It's alright.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.428
I can make it work.

40:08.578 --> 40:09.605
I can't.

40:12.468 --> 40:14.476
I want you to go home
and get some sleep.

40:14.626 --> 40:16.570
We got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

40:18.097 --> 40:19.512
Good night, David.

40:22.928 --> 40:24.249
Good night, Bob.

40:28.412 --> 40:30.034
I'll clean up that beaker.

40:30.762 --> 40:31.770
Okay.

41:06.405 --> 41:08.259
Holy mother of God!

41:09.165 --> 41:10.306
Smallpox.

41:10.844 --> 41:12.603
But here's the thing. It's synthetic.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.680
How can you be sure?

41:14.984 --> 41:16.906
There's a problem
with the coding of the strain.

41:18.199 --> 41:19.148
Here.

41:19.829 --> 41:22.620
Position 72,220.

41:22.770 --> 41:24.445
That G should be an A.

41:24.755 --> 41:27.874
It's an A in every other strain
of smallpox except this one.

41:28.024 --> 41:29.607
Now, in the early days of sequencing,

41:29.757 --> 41:31.872
it was quite easy to make
mistakes in the G regions.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.438
Is it or is it not deadly?

41:34.596 --> 41:36.753
That's a very good question, Wes.

41:37.303 --> 41:40.209
If it slithers on the ground,
has a rattle and 2 big fucking fangs,

41:40.359 --> 41:41.747
you check if it's poisonous?

41:41.897 --> 41:44.824
You found that?
One difference in 185 000?

41:45.150 --> 41:48.180
Well, I had a little help
from a program that Mayko wrote.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.351
And it's in the TK gene

41:50.558 --> 41:53.603
which just so happens to be the area
of the genome that I used to work on.

41:53.825 --> 41:55.816
So I know it by heart. I'm...

41:56.203 --> 41:57.483
I'm obsessive, remember?

41:58.899 --> 42:01.975
- How can you be sure it's synthetic?
- It's like Rachel says.

42:02.130 --> 42:04.367
When this sequence was entered
into the World Gene Bank,

42:04.517 --> 42:07.340
it was entered incorrectly.
This is a... It's a typo.

42:07.606 --> 42:09.030
This virus isn't real.

42:09.851 --> 42:10.879
What's that?

42:11.684 --> 42:13.036
What are we looking at?

42:13.186 --> 42:14.189
Well...

42:14.747 --> 42:17.461
Think of yourself as an alien.
You find a picture book of horse.

42:17.615 --> 42:21.767
and you decide to manufacture a horse,
based on the pictures.

42:21.992 --> 42:25.761
The book has everything.
Palominos, Pintos, Arabians.

42:26.264 --> 42:28.667
It even has
a couple of pictures of unicorns.

42:28.817 --> 42:30.915
But you're an alien.
You don't know the difference.

42:31.065 --> 42:33.644
And with this book as your only
reference, they're all real.

42:33.794 --> 42:36.683
So someone built
this smallpox genetic code

42:36.833 --> 42:38.981
based on a sequence
that exists only in cyberspace.

42:39.131 --> 42:41.202
So someone can just build smallpox?

42:41.352 --> 42:44.394
Well, theoretically. The technology
is relatively straightforward.

42:44.544 --> 42:48.480
We manufacture genetic material
from chemicals all the time.

42:48.909 --> 42:50.947
So when a lab needs DNA,

42:51.167 --> 42:55.683
it usually just orders it from another
lab that specializes in synthesizing it.

42:55.877 --> 42:57.692
We do it here at the lab all the time.

42:57.842 --> 42:59.417
It's cheaper & faster.

42:59.567 --> 43:01.367
What? I can't look
at your purchase orders?

43:01.517 --> 43:03.679
Some maniac can just order up smallpox?

43:03.870 --> 43:04.885
No, no.

43:05.035 --> 43:09.310
It's impossible to synthesize DNA
as large as the smallpox genome.

43:09.460 --> 43:12.590
And there are security measures in place
that prevent that from happening.

43:12.740 --> 43:15.793
You can, however,
order DNA in smaller sequences.

43:15.943 --> 43:18.113
Say, 200 nucleotides or less.

43:18.263 --> 43:20.673
- There's no security check for that?
- No.

43:21.865 --> 43:25.803
Even though the smallpox virus
is 185 000 nucleotides long,

43:26.476 --> 43:29.240
it's made up of combinations
of only 4 nucleotides.

43:29.613 --> 43:30.696
A, C, T and G.

43:30.846 --> 43:33.025
And those
combinations can be found in...

43:33.473 --> 43:36.249
other viruses,
good bacteria, even humans.

43:36.494 --> 43:38.291
So you just order up those.

43:38.567 --> 43:40.062
You can't police that.

43:40.295 --> 43:41.252
So what then?

43:41.705 --> 43:45.971
As crude as it seems, you just sew 'em
together and wind up with smallpox.

43:46.519 --> 43:47.614
Unbelievable.

43:48.407 --> 43:51.051
Okay, anthrax and glanders.
Could that be synthetic, too?

43:51.201 --> 43:52.345
No. Both are bacteria.

43:52.495 --> 43:55.137
They're far more complex
organisms than virus.

43:55.287 --> 43:58.673
It would be like the difference between
building a skyscraper and a bird feeder.

43:58.823 --> 43:59.657
Yeah.

43:59.807 --> 44:01.066
Who could pull this off?

44:01.216 --> 44:04.925
Basically anyone qualified to work
in a microbiology lab could do it.

44:05.075 --> 44:07.440
I mean. And that's what,
5 000 people in the US alone.

44:07.590 --> 44:11.464
- What sort of facilities do they need?
- Any university and lab could do it.

44:11.614 --> 44:13.230
Is this guy's work recognizable?

44:13.380 --> 44:16.326
Like a diamond can leave the signature
style when he's working on a rock?

44:16.476 --> 44:17.663
Completely untraceable.

44:18.443 --> 44:20.673
So how do we go about finding this guy?

44:20.823 --> 44:22.670
We don't have to. He's found us.

44:24.947 --> 44:26.357
Time to go public.

44:27.746 --> 44:29.091
He's going to deploy it.

44:29.241 --> 44:30.463
It's a show of force.

44:30.613 --> 44:33.431
Maybe that's what the anthrax
and the glanders were. A show of force.

44:33.581 --> 44:34.684
Maybe.

44:35.356 --> 44:38.352
Isn't the more important question:
where is it gonna be deployed?

44:38.980 --> 44:41.766
Oh, I have a feeling
we're gonna find that out real soon.

44:49.928 --> 44:51.241
He's in the US.

44:51.391 --> 44:52.967
East coast. Manhattan.

44:54.679 --> 44:58.619
This is www.censorthenet.org.

44:59.063 --> 45:00.204
Censor the net?

45:00.354 --> 45:01.660
A bit late in the day, no?

45:01.820 --> 45:04.597
He synthesized one of the deadliest
killers this planet's ever seen

45:04.747 --> 45:06.302
from stuff he got off the internet.

45:06.452 --> 45:07.501
Hello.

45:09.476 --> 45:10.330
My God.

45:10.634 --> 45:11.641
Rachel!

45:12.934 --> 45:15.149
- Where is he?
- They're still working on him.

45:15.299 --> 45:17.367
- What happened?
- They were attacked by some bear

45:17.517 --> 45:19.501
- they were studying.
- Oh Jesus!

45:19.884 --> 45:21.977
The storm's north
of the Queen Charlotte islands.

45:22.463 --> 45:24.525
- Coming ashore?
- It's just a matter of time.

45:25.042 --> 45:27.315
A storm cloud of pathogens
is gonna hit Vancouver.

45:27.465 --> 45:28.918
Population of 2 million David.

45:29.068 --> 45:30.370
- Dr. SandstrÃ¶m.
- Robbie.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.673
You said you knew who I was looking for.

45:34.077 --> 45:35.156
Who is it?

45:35.306 --> 45:37.835
Guy gets gunned down
in cold blood in front of my office!

45:38.183 --> 45:40.285
There are issues
of national security in play.

45:40.435 --> 45:42.730
He was executed? Who gave the order?!

45:43.305 --> 45:49.536
