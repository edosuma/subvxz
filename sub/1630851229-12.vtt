00:02.263 --> 00:03.090
Don't
miss "The Resident ”'s

00:03.220 --> 00:04.439
most riveting season yet.

00:04.526 --> 00:05.396
I'm a doctor.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.050
I'm gonna take care
of you, promise.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.747
See all new
episodes, Tuesdays,

00:08.878 --> 00:10.575
and check out our
other Fox shows,

00:10.706 --> 00:13.622
"9-1-1 Lone Star," "The Cleaning
Lady," and "Joe Millionaire"--

00:15.102 --> 00:16.016
only on Fox.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.890
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

00:21.021 --> 00:22.457
I have multiple sclerosis.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.285
We could always use more women
in neurosurgery,

00:24.372 --> 00:25.677
but I would never try
to recruit you.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.202
- Why?
- Devon would kill me, for one thing.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.551
He'll support whatever
I choose to do.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.902
- Kit, I'm leaving Chastain.
- A leave of absence.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.035
- Of course, to heal...
- No, permanently.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.734
I was raped by our neighbor.
I was 13.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.084
- He was a grown man.
- Billie...

00:52.443 --> 00:54.837
Hey, come here.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.795
No, I'm fine.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.536
You're getting soaked.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.365
I'm not gonna melt. Promise.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.766
Hey, I need some help!

01:10.940 --> 01:12.811
Hey. I was headed to a call

01:12.942 --> 01:15.118
when I found her on the
Centerville exit off of 124.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.294
She was all by herself.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.166
She's limping,
and she's freezing cold.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.211
She needs help,
so I brought her straight here.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.169
You did the right thing.
What's your name?

01:22.299 --> 01:23.605
She hasn't said a word

01:23.735 --> 01:25.476
since I found her.
She hasn't cried either.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.609
Not a sound.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.915
I'm gonna take you inside
and get you warm, okay?

01:32.353 --> 01:34.355
I'm a doctor. I won't hurt you.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.966
I'm gonna take care of you,
I promise.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.970
Don't be afraid.

01:48.238 --> 01:51.067
My little girl made that.
Do you like it?

01:54.331 --> 01:55.289
Okay.

01:58.422 --> 02:01.295
- Here we go.
- Thanks, Doc.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.080
What happened?

02:04.211 --> 02:05.603
Tow truck driver brought her in.

02:05.777 --> 02:06.996
Found her alone
by the side of the road.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.653
She is not speaking.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.003
Clara, let's get a temp,
change her out of these clothes,

02:14.177 --> 02:15.918
and get her on the monitor.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.359
It's not registering.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.361
She's hypothermic.
We need a core temp.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.670
And some blankets
and warmed saline.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.714
I'm on it.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.238
Her right arm.

02:34.545 --> 02:37.113
Posterior shoulder dislocation.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.508
- No swelling around the joint.
- Let's reduce that, quick.

02:43.685 --> 02:47.384
This will hurt, but then
it will feel much better, okay?

02:51.475 --> 02:53.825
Not a peep.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.218
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.699
Clara, can you call Winston?

02:57.829 --> 03:00.310
- Tell him we have an unaccompanied minor.
- Yeah.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.451
So, I did the math.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.627
For you to be
double board-certified

03:12.714 --> 03:15.195
in neuro and
cardiothoracic surgery,

03:15.282 --> 03:17.109
it would take you,
like, eight years.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.635
Think about it, Devon. I could
drain a brain bleed on a Monday

03:20.809 --> 03:24.160
and hold a beating heart
in my hands on a Tuesday.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.858
Look, I love that you want to do

03:26.945 --> 03:28.643
all the things,

03:28.817 --> 03:31.385
but I'm just concerned that
you're gonna get burned out.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.474
There's only 24 hours in a day.

03:33.648 --> 03:36.651
I'm spending two of them
standing outside in the rain

03:36.825 --> 03:39.219
so you can buy sneakers.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.046
Come on, the line's moving.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.092
You're a good woman.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.573
<i>
Look at you all coming out</i> <i>
in the rain</i>

03:45.747 --> 03:47.052
for this drop.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.403
From my heart, I thank you.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.319
Now, come and get these kicks.

03:53.537 --> 03:56.410
Oh, damn. These black
vapor lows are fire.

03:56.497 --> 03:59.543
Geez. I have to have these.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.546
Hey, Haircut. Caught your drip
the moment you walked up,

04:02.677 --> 04:06.071
and I saw you eyeing these.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.899
Are you feeling all right?

04:07.986 --> 04:11.251
Oh, don't worry about me.
I just got "big girl-itis."

04:11.425 --> 04:14.341
My name is Dr. Pravesh.
This is Dr. Devi.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.473
Seems like you're having
some chest pain.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.389
Why don't we just
take a seat here.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.305
<i>♪ But I came here</i> <i>
to get busy...</i>♪

04:22.479 --> 04:25.134
I just need another antacid.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.136
Will you hand me my purse?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.443
<i>♪ But I came to get down...</i>♪

04:29.573 --> 04:31.488
Just gonna check your pulse.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.751
How many of these
have you taken today?

04:33.925 --> 04:35.927
Uh... all of them.

04:36.101 --> 04:39.583
- Your heart is racing.
- It's just nerves, is all.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.325
This is my big day. I have been
planning this for months.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.718
We need to get you
to a hospital.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.807
No, no, no, no,
no, ham, no, ma'am.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.939
There is a photographer coming
from <i>Best of Atlanta.</i>

04:48.026 --> 04:49.724
I got an interview later.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.116
You could be having
a heart attack.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.249
No. I-- No.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.034
We are not gonna take no for an answer.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.254
<i>♪ What you playin' for?</i>♪

05:13.748 --> 05:15.315
Hey.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.709
Hope you didn't
have plans later.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.582
No problem.
I already cleared my schedule.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.846
I want to hang out
with my new best friend here.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.457
I'm sad to say no one's ever
mistook me for Mary Poppins.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.548
Shoulder should be
feeling better.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.551
Can you move your arm for me?

05:34.725 --> 05:38.642
So, she understands what we say.
Follows direction.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.078
That's progress.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.955
Winston's here.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.612
Nurse Clara's
gonna take care of you

05:51.786 --> 05:54.571
while we talk to Winston, okay?

05:54.745 --> 05:56.138
Be right back.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.886
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, not a problem at all.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.235
You have an unaccompanied minor?

06:06.322 --> 06:07.889
She was left on the side
of the road

06:08.019 --> 06:09.760
with a dislocated shoulder.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.936
Seems like she was running
from something

06:12.110 --> 06:13.155
or someone.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.417
Um...

06:14.591 --> 06:16.767
She's not talking,
so there's a lot

06:16.898 --> 06:18.552
we don't know yet.
We've established her lack

06:18.682 --> 06:20.031
of speech isn't a lack
of understanding.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.251
Have you checked for signs
of physical abuse?

06:22.338 --> 06:23.905
She's headed for scans shortly.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.863
Oh, I'll contact Atlanta P.D.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.300
If there's been
a missing child report,

06:28.475 --> 06:29.389
we'll know soon.
In the meantime,

06:29.476 --> 06:31.478
Chastain has to assume

06:31.565 --> 06:33.218
an emergency
temporary guardianship.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.524
Who's gonna be
taking care of her?

06:34.698 --> 06:36.439
Dr. Sullivan,
it's your ER shift,

06:36.526 --> 06:38.136
- so I presume...
- Me. Happy to.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.793
She's bonded with me, so

06:42.880 --> 06:44.229
I'll run point.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.234
It's good with me.
Takes a village, right?

06:49.321 --> 06:52.020
The village of Drs. Hawkins-Sullivan.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.631
Got it. And the child's name?

06:57.025 --> 06:58.635
Jane Doe.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.207
Good morning.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.645
Didn't I leave you in a warm bed
blissfully asleep?

07:08.819 --> 07:12.040
Yes, you did.
And for that, I thank you.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.085
But-but, listen,
before you get too excited,

07:14.259 --> 07:17.132
I'm not here officially.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.134
Just a social call.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.876
The doctors at the Mayo said
you could return to surgery.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.834
The steroid pulse
and immunomodulators

07:23.921 --> 07:25.836
have been amazing
at stopping your M.S. symptoms.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.926
I-I know, and I'm grateful
and I'm, and I'm hopeful

07:29.100 --> 07:30.667
and I'm reassured,

07:30.841 --> 07:33.757
but I'm... I'm not there yet.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.543
If this isn't your
official return,

07:36.673 --> 07:39.502
did you really come
all the way here

07:39.589 --> 07:40.895
in the rain
just to bring me a latte?

07:40.982 --> 07:43.245
No. There's something I wanted
to tell you. I've, um...

07:43.332 --> 07:45.334
I've been shortlisted

07:45.508 --> 07:47.510
for a seat
at the state medical board.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.428
That's wonderful, Randolph.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.082
They could use people like you.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.650
Doctors policing doctors

07:56.780 --> 07:58.652
has not worked well
for patients.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.132
We all need to be
more accountable, and...

08:01.219 --> 08:03.700
You know, it's been
a long career, and I've seen

08:03.874 --> 08:05.572
mistakes happen
that shouldn't have,

08:05.659 --> 08:07.269
and you know
I've made them myself.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.663
And I'd just...

08:09.793 --> 08:11.534
like to try
and make up for that.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.189
It's a brilliant idea.

08:14.363 --> 08:17.801
Well, it's-it's not a done deal.
There's-there's only one seat

08:17.975 --> 08:20.151
- open on the board.
- Oh, they'll pick you.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.893
You know, if-if I get it,

08:22.980 --> 08:25.896
I can fight
for patients' rights without

08:25.983 --> 08:27.855
having a patient's life
in my hands.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.337
I hope it adds some
new meaning to my career.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.906
Just promise me one thing.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.039
You won't give up
on the OR just yet.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.302
We still need you.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.829
I need a full blood panel,
chest X-ray and EKG.

08:45.916 --> 08:49.529
The EMTs said they
couldn't find a vein.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.357
- Hundley?
- Leave it to me.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.621
Sit up for me, Roxie.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.537
Can we talk?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.800
- Woman to woman?
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.887 --> 09:03.107
That normal BP cuff,
that is not gonna fit my arm.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.761
Thanks for the tip,

09:04.935 --> 09:06.763
but I'm one step ahead of you.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.201
This is a leg BP cuff.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.638
It'll do the trick.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.902
In my ER, you get what you need.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.382
Sit back please. Thank you.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.646
Hi.
Hey.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.953
I'm glad I listened
to you and Dr. Pravesh.

09:23.040 --> 09:23.954
This pain is no joke.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.217
Keep me posted.

09:26.348 --> 09:27.915
Will do.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.224
I brought you something
to eat and drink

09:33.355 --> 09:36.010
from our world-famous

09:36.184 --> 09:37.359
Chastain cafeteria.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.317
Let's start with the juice.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
No issues swallowing.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.326
And no respiratory
symptoms either.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.328
Her lungs are clear,

09:50.415 --> 09:52.635
but look at this.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.028
We just took off
her socks and...

10:02.297 --> 10:04.995
Tachy. 140. She's in pain.
Let's get her some ibuprofen.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.606
Got it.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.914
Soft tissue is macerated.
This could be trench foot.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.657
I'll elevate her feet.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.269
Looks like she was standing
in the rain all night.

10:18.356 --> 10:21.229
Must've been numb from the cold.
Now that we're warming her up,

10:21.316 --> 10:23.884
her feeling's coming back.

10:23.971 --> 10:27.409
Skin is already infected,
and it could get worse.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.848
If you need to cry or yell,

10:32.022 --> 10:34.242
or if you want to hold my hand,

10:34.416 --> 10:35.939
you can do that,

10:36.070 --> 10:37.506
okay, honey?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.734
You try sitting still

10:47.908 --> 10:49.257
while you're crammed
into a metal cage.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.389
I got you.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.087
I should've done that.
I'm sorry.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.741
It's not your fault.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.308
The world's made for folks
your size, not mine,

10:57.482 --> 10:59.310
but I see you trying.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.747
He's one of the good ones.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.667
And that is one
of the fine ones.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.669
Don't let him hear that.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.932
Hey. I am Dr. Austin.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.630
Dr. Pravesh tells me that
you're having some chest pains.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.327
And shortness of breath,

11:16.501 --> 11:18.852
with a normal EKG.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.767
We're just waiting
on the chest X-ray.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.856
Reflux?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
Here we go.
Heard that one a dozen times.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.817
Not from what I can tell.
I think it's more.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.124
It sounds like
mediastinal crepitus to me.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.735
It's hard to hear anything
through the soft tissue.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.958
There are no signs
of SUBQ emphysema.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.134
That's good, but, Pravesh,
you know I can't do

11:40.221 --> 11:42.832
a complete consult
without all the data.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.792
Call me when you get an X-ray,
all right?

11:49.752 --> 11:52.363
He always that way?

11:52.450 --> 11:55.105
Well, he is a very busy surgeon.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.804
And there's something going on
with his mother recently.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.197
He's just got a lot
on his plate.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.504
- Mm-hmm.
- But that is not an excuse, I know.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.725
Sounds like one.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.345
Morning.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.955
- Dr. Bell?
- Yeah.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.827
The lieutenant governor needs
a few minutes

12:21.001 --> 12:22.480
before your meeting begins.
Please have a seat.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.744
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.925
Well, it's the famous Dr. Bell.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.578
Bob Porter.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.537
University Hospital, Augusta.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.452
I know who you are.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.975
- The highest billing ortho in Georgia.
- Well, I'd prefer

12:39.062 --> 12:41.456
to be known for my outcomes,
but I'll take it.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.719
So you must be the other name
on the governor's short list

12:43.850 --> 12:45.416
for a seat on the medical board.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.331
So we are competitors.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.377
Honored indeed.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.334
Do you know Beaumont?

12:50.508 --> 12:51.771
No. Never met him.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.642
A lovely guy.
He and I go way back.

12:53.729 --> 12:54.861
We were roommates at Dartmouth.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.080
Oh, okay, well,
I guess the fix is in.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.952
No, no, no. Your reputation
speaks for itself.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.302
Well, thank you,
that's very kind, um...

13:01.389 --> 13:04.000
You mind if I ask you why
you want a seat on the board?

13:04.174 --> 13:06.568
Licensing physicians,
investigating

13:06.655 --> 13:08.222
patient complaints-- I mean,

13:08.309 --> 13:10.093
that can't hold a candle
to running four ORs at once.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.009
Don't believe
everything you hear.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.968
Seriously, why do you want it?

13:15.098 --> 13:17.187
Well, I don't know, I guess
at this point in my life,

13:17.274 --> 13:18.406
I, uh...

13:18.580 --> 13:20.930
just want to give back.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.413
He's ready for you, Dr. Bell.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.241
Nice meeting you.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.112
- Same here.
- Mm-hmm.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.333
So, show me this hand of yours

13:32.463 --> 13:34.291
that hurts so much.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.379
Yeah, it's really sore.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.903
Is it sore

13:37.033 --> 13:38.948
- in your thumb?
- Yeah, it's...

13:39.122 --> 13:41.211
Is it this,
just this finger right here?

13:41.342 --> 13:43.474
- Mm-hmm.
- Really? And you don't feel anything on this side?

13:43.561 --> 13:45.868
- No. Oh, yeah.
- Do you feel anything in your wrist?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.348
- Anything in your forearm?
- Of course.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.176
The elbow?
Mm-hmm.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.307
You're hurt everywhere.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.135
There's got to be
a specific place...

13:52.266 --> 13:54.834
<i>Atlanta PD</i> <i>
doesn't have any missing child</i>

13:54.921 --> 13:56.705
reports that match
your Jane Doe.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.794
But I notified DFCS.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.970
And if anyone recognizes her,

14:01.144 --> 14:03.146
they'll let me know.
Until then...

14:03.320 --> 14:06.280
The hospital has temporary
emergency guardianship

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
and you two are in charge.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.544
Thank you.

14:09.718 --> 14:10.850
Did she have her psych consults?

14:11.024 --> 14:13.026
Yes, and as we suspected,

14:13.156 --> 14:15.289
her silence is very likely
the result of trauma.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.899
Whether that's
from her recent injuries

14:17.073 --> 14:18.683
or something much worse,
they don't know.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.381
She has a cracked rib,

14:20.555 --> 14:22.296
- a few suspicious bruises.
- All signs point to abuse.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.863
Well, it's definitely
a possibility, but...

14:23.950 --> 14:25.516
I'll keep looking for family.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.214
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do

14:27.388 --> 14:29.694
to protect her.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.352
Hey, I know you have a daughter.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.528
So if this case is hitting
too close to home for you...

14:37.615 --> 14:39.313
Yeah, it hits close to home.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.967
But...

14:41.054 --> 14:42.969
there's nowhere else
I'd rather be.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.540
She's choosing not to speak
to feel safe.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.501
I'm seeing
a lot of that recently.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.204
Mm.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.423
My savior.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.207
My last doctor

15:04.338 --> 15:06.122
used to make me
bring my own hospital gown

15:06.209 --> 15:08.690
to her office. Sewed it myself.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.910
Denim and rhinestones.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.737
Well, that sounds fly as hell.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.000
Where can I get one?

15:14.130 --> 15:16.567
If y'all make me feel better,

15:16.654 --> 15:18.308
I'll sew one for you, too.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.527
Deal.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.311
Can we get her close-up

15:21.398 --> 15:23.357
over with
so she can sit back down?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.925
This will take
just a minute, Roxie.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.236
Um... Dr. Pravesh?

15:33.367 --> 15:34.934
The picture probably
won't be very clear

15:35.108 --> 15:37.023
because of... her size.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.372
The lungs are the same size

15:38.459 --> 15:39.721
even when the patient is
very large.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.028
Yeah, but the body mass

15:42.202 --> 15:43.551
around the lungs can mess up
the image.

15:43.725 --> 15:44.987
A CT might be better...

15:45.161 --> 15:46.597
except the machine has
a weight limit.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.860
The CT delivers 200 times

15:49.035 --> 15:50.514
more radiation
than a chest X-ray.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.516
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm the doctor.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.779
I ordered a chest X-ray.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.912
So please make that happen.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.964
How are we doing?

16:05.051 --> 16:07.357
Her heart rate is normal.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.533
And she just got
her first dose of antibiotics.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.579
Okay.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.190
So...

16:14.277 --> 16:16.062
this is my house.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.197
Can you draw yours?

16:31.207 --> 16:33.209
Do you live in a car, honey?

16:40.651 --> 16:43.567
This line...

16:43.741 --> 16:45.526
tells us how your foot

16:45.613 --> 16:47.484
is doing.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.312
If the medicine is working,

16:49.486 --> 16:52.794
the infection won't spread
outside the line.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.060
You need another color marker
over there?

17:03.239 --> 17:05.676
Trade colors with me.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.853
He is so good with kids ever
since he had one of his own.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.507
Well, I'm still struggling

17:10.681 --> 17:12.944
to find a way
to make her trust me.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.642
She bonded with him instantly.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.122
Don't feel bad.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.298
- You never had a chance.
- Yeah, no, I get that.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.040
The guy's like a picnic basket
filled with cupcakes

17:21.214 --> 17:23.216
and ponies and sunbeams.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.439
Anyway, I reviewed
your patient's chart.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.746
If she were unable to talk
due to damage to her brain,

17:31.920 --> 17:34.705
she'd be making sounds
or struggling to be understood.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.403
Which isn't the case.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.882
So you're good with us
holding off on a head CT?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.928
Completely.

17:40.015 --> 17:40.842
She's been through enough.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.453
Clearly. The question is what?

17:43.540 --> 17:46.282
She's guarding
some kind of secret.

17:46.369 --> 17:49.068
But we need
the truth to help her.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.818
Now do you see any evidence
of pneumothorax

18:00.949 --> 18:02.603
or pneumomediastinum?

18:02.777 --> 18:04.474
- Because I'm thinking that maybe right here...
- No.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.389
Okay.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.304
But given her symptoms,
we have to...

18:08.478 --> 18:10.611
You know how to read
an X-ray, Pravesh.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.831
This one is not giving us
any actionable information.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.052
With her body habitus, we can't
even comment on the lung field,

18:17.139 --> 18:18.662
let alone make out
a subtle finding.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.143
AJ?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.537
- You are being dismissive.
- No.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.321
I'm being real.
There are complications

18:25.495 --> 18:27.410
when carrying around
that kind of weight.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.369
Believe me when I tell you
that she is painfully aware

18:29.543 --> 18:31.762
of that fact,
and it's part of the reason

18:31.849 --> 18:34.417
- why she hasn't gotten treated.
- So stop dancing around the issue

18:34.548 --> 18:36.506
and explain to your patient
that her size

18:36.593 --> 18:38.552
is preventing you
from reaching a diagnosis.

18:38.639 --> 18:41.555
She does not need me to tell her
that she is obese.

18:41.642 --> 18:42.730
Why not?

18:42.817 --> 18:44.949
It's a medical condition,
like any other.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.173
Who do you think does more harm,
Pravesh?

18:51.260 --> 18:53.001
The doctor who names the disease

18:53.175 --> 18:55.134
or the doctor
who won't even utter it?

18:56.787 --> 19:00.008
Get a better picture of what's
going on inside Ms. Cabot.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.152
- What happened?
- Her heart rate shot up.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.197
She's febrile to 102.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.417
Her white blood cell count is
up to 25,000.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.897
The cellulitis is
advancing outside the margins,

19:20.028 --> 19:20.811
despite antibiotics.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.336
Pain out of proportion.

19:23.423 --> 19:27.035
You're worried
about necrotizing fasciitis?

19:29.994 --> 19:31.996
We need a surgical consult.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.913
She might be headed to the OR.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.701
We are talking
about a highly lethal infection.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.398
Which we're not certain she has.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.271
The CT shows no evidence
of gas in the tissue.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.316
But a CT scan can miss
the diagnosis.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.839
And if this is
necrotizing fasciitis,

19:48.926 --> 19:50.058
we can't afford to wait.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.582
She could lose her leg.
Or worse.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.367
None of us want that,
but we have

19:54.497 --> 19:56.020
to consider
what recovery from surgery

19:56.107 --> 19:57.370
will look like for this patient.

19:57.457 --> 20:00.199
Limited mobility
or amputation would be

20:00.286 --> 20:02.331
a massive hurdle for a kid

20:02.505 --> 20:04.464
whose basic needs
aren't being met.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.422
You're asking me to open up
a little girl's leg

20:06.596 --> 20:07.945
based on a hunch.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.643
Yes, her leg is still red.

20:09.817 --> 20:13.168
But the swelling is minimal,
no evidence of blistering.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.518
I would have a hard time
justifying this kind

20:15.605 --> 20:17.738
of exploration even
on a fully consenting adult.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.958
We have no medical record
for our little Jane Doe, so

20:21.089 --> 20:23.396
if we're wrong and she suffers
any complications,

20:23.483 --> 20:26.225
then it's not just surgery
without consent.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.401
It's criminal assault
on a minor.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.838
What happened to our emergency
guardianship?

20:30.925 --> 20:32.318
It allows Chastain to do

20:32.492 --> 20:34.276
anything necessary
to save her life.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.104
Can you tell yourself
with certainty

20:36.278 --> 20:38.889
that this falls
into those parameters?

20:41.718 --> 20:43.938
Right now, my suspicion
for necrotizing fasciitis

20:44.112 --> 20:46.070
is just a suspicion.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.639
I agree. The infection doesn't

20:49.726 --> 20:52.033
constitute an immediate
life-or-death threat.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.688
But waiting is dangerous, too.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.820
Things could change fast.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.215
Get her admitted
to the pediatric floor.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.565
We'll monitor her leg
like a hawk.

21:02.652 --> 21:05.525
If she worsens,
if she becomes hemodynamically

21:05.699 --> 21:07.875
unstable, if the wind blows
the wrong way,

21:07.962 --> 21:09.311
I'll take her to the OR.

21:09.485 --> 21:13.054
Regardless of the consequences.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.450
Hey, Billie.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.324
I-I have a favor to ask.

21:22.411 --> 21:25.022
Well, if it's about jumping in
on these two hernia repairs

21:25.153 --> 21:27.024
or the bowel obstruction,
then yes.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.679
- A thousand times yes.
- No, I need a letter of recommendation

21:29.766 --> 21:31.768
for the Georgia State
Medical Board.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.683
Oh, well...

21:33.770 --> 21:35.294
Georgia could certainly use
more doctors

21:35.381 --> 21:37.034
willing to fight
for patient safety.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.254
I'm competing for the spot
with another doctor.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.125
And he's-he's connected,
he's a star

21:41.212 --> 21:42.953
at his hospital in Augusta...

21:43.040 --> 21:45.478
- top earner.
- And you want to outshine him?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.262
Yeah, it's not gonna be easy.
He's, uh,

21:47.393 --> 21:48.307
he's a powerful guy,
he's very slick.

21:48.394 --> 21:51.179
I just need to stack the deck

21:51.353 --> 21:52.702
- as much as I can.
- Who is he?

21:52.876 --> 21:54.487
Robert Porter.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.839
Oh, you know him?
Yeah, well, of course.

21:58.969 --> 22:02.582
Well, maybe. There are probably
a lot of doctors with that name.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.149
This is him.

22:08.239 --> 22:11.068
You'll have your recommendation
on your desk by end of day.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.636
Okay, thank you.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.797
That is
an esophageal perforation.

22:43.884 --> 22:47.453
Roxie, what that means is fluid
is leaking out of

22:47.540 --> 22:49.019
your esophagus
into your chest cavity,

22:49.193 --> 22:51.631
which is why you're in pain.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.459
Can you repair it?

22:53.546 --> 22:55.722
Well, the perf is
a tough surgery on anyone.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.202
It's even more complex
if I'm operating on someone

22:58.289 --> 23:01.031
- with a BMI of 50.
- Wow. Do you talk that insensitively

23:01.205 --> 23:02.642
about all your patients?

23:02.816 --> 23:05.035
Or just the ones whose body type
you don't approve of?

23:05.209 --> 23:06.646
Forgive Dr. Austin.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.387
- What he means to say...
- He meant to insult me!

23:08.561 --> 23:11.041
Maybe I don't need surgery.

23:11.215 --> 23:14.001
Maybe he can't handle me
because I have too much

23:14.088 --> 23:17.352
- "soft tissue."
- My job is to assess the entire patient.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.920
And make sure
you are aware of the risks.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.922
I'm guessing you're 30, 31?

23:22.009 --> 23:24.185
I'm flattered, but no, I have
a few more years under my belt.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.969
I'm not asking your age.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.145
I'm talking <i>your</i> BMI.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.234
I'd put you at... 32?

23:30.321 --> 23:32.454
Anything over 29
makes <i>you</i> obese.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.848
- Which is why I work out.
- So do I!

23:34.935 --> 23:36.850
Six miles on a bike
every other day

23:37.024 --> 23:38.199
and yoga in between.

23:38.373 --> 23:41.071
I'm a person, Dr. Austin.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.814
And you're an arrogant jerk.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.512
True.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.078
But I'm also
the most straightforward doctor

23:48.165 --> 23:51.299
you will meet in this hospital.
I heal with my hands.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.954
Not my oratory skills.
Now, when

23:54.128 --> 23:56.435
I look at you, Ms. Cabot,
I see a woman who is very strong

23:56.609 --> 23:58.567
who can handle
some straight talk.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.484
So...

24:02.658 --> 24:05.095
are you ready
to talk about the vomiting?

24:08.969 --> 24:11.058
Roxie, I found enamel erosion
and staining in your mouth

24:11.232 --> 24:13.408
when I did the exam.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.498
Classic signs of... bulimia.

24:16.672 --> 24:19.893
Which caused the damage
in your esophagus.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.677
The surgery will be a waste
if we don't get

24:21.851 --> 24:24.463
to the root cause
of all the problems.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.731
I've dieted all my life.

24:31.818 --> 24:35.038
And no one believes
how hard I try.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.737
I try...

24:39.913 --> 24:43.177
Somewhere along the line
I just...

24:43.351 --> 24:46.267
I got desperate, I...

24:49.575 --> 24:51.533
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.319
Obesity is a complex disease

24:55.494 --> 24:57.147
with a myriad of factors.

24:57.321 --> 25:00.716
But purging after every meal
is not the answer.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.675
AJ.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.807
No...

25:04.938 --> 25:06.722
it's okay.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.159
I'm actually beginning
to appreciate his candor.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.379
Well, thank you.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.947
And I appreciate yours,
Ms. Cabot.

25:14.034 --> 25:17.559
I've never had a doctor
talk to me the way you two have.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.738
They either ignore me
or write me off.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.569
I gave up thinking anyone
could help me.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.617
We can help you.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.619
All right?

25:33.706 --> 25:36.273
Dr. Austin is gonna
repair the perforation.

25:36.404 --> 25:37.536
And we are gonna come up

25:37.623 --> 25:39.842
with a plan
for treating the rest.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.757
Deal?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.588
Deal.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.766
Hey, my shift is over.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.638
But I couldn't leave
without finding out

25:52.725 --> 25:54.204
how our little Jane Doe
is doing.

25:54.378 --> 25:56.859
I have to show you something.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.427
Hey.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.300
Dr. Cade would like
to see that burn.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.389
Is that okay?

26:11.787 --> 26:14.050
It's a Lichtenberg figure.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.052
From a lightning strike.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.925
Lightning could explain the
posterior shoulder dislocation.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.666
And maybe help us figure out
where she came from.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.712
Let me check my weather app.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.020
Three lightning strikes

26:27.194 --> 26:29.762
touched down
here, here and here.

26:29.892 --> 26:32.068
This is sort of near
where she was found-- it's near

26:32.242 --> 26:34.114
Black Shoals Park area.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.203
I've biked out there.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.771
It's a tough area for a kid.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.121
Lots of homeless encampments.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.863
She couldn't have been all
the way out there on her own.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.648
Maybe whoever she was with
is still out there?

26:46.735 --> 26:48.868
- I'll go find out.
- No, that's a bad idea.

26:48.955 --> 26:52.654
- We don't know what you'd be walking into.
- I can handle myself.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.047
And you have to stay
with her and if this

26:54.221 --> 26:55.396
gets worse, you got to get Kit
to authorize surgery.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.441
You can't go out there alone.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.879
You stay. Let me go.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.627
I'm glad to have a way
I can help.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.942
What can I do
for you, Dr. Sutton?

27:22.858 --> 27:25.034
This is hard.

27:25.121 --> 27:28.081
I don't want to involve you,
but I have no choice.

27:28.255 --> 27:31.432
I need to talk
to the state medical board.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.826
And why is that?

27:33.956 --> 27:36.306
Dr. Bell asked me to write him
a recommendation for it.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.526
He told me Robert Porter

27:38.700 --> 27:40.528
is angling
for a seat on the board.

27:40.615 --> 27:43.705
Robert Porter, the orthopedic
surgeon in Augusta?

27:43.879 --> 27:45.446
He has to be stopped.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.753
He's a pedophile.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.408
How do you know that?

27:52.758 --> 27:55.761
He raped me
when I was 13 years old.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.633
Oh, Billie.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.289
I am so sorry.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.203
It was a long time ago.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.118
I survived.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.555
My feelings aren't
what matters right now.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.340
What matters is
there's no way in hell

28:10.427 --> 28:11.777
Porter should be allowed
to judge

28:11.864 --> 28:13.126
the moral failings
of other doctors.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.868
You want to go
before the board and tell them?

28:15.955 --> 28:18.348
Yes. I want to make a statement.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.699
Porter will deny it, of course.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.484
Do you have any proof?

28:25.094 --> 28:27.357
It's complicated.

28:27.444 --> 28:30.534
There's another person involved
that I can't bring into this.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.538
It will have to be
Porter's word against mine.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.977
You know women who come forward

28:38.064 --> 28:40.240
with abuse allegations are
often attacked.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.198
I know.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.766
But I have to try.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.900
Let me talk
to the lieutenant governor

28:47.987 --> 28:51.164
and tell him you have
crucial information.

28:51.251 --> 28:55.559
Perhaps we can keep them
from releasing your name.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.606
But I can't guarantee it.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.349
Thank you.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.704
Dr. Hawkins?

29:14.404 --> 29:15.579
How's she doing?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.494
Her infection is worsening.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.192
I suspect it's bacteremic.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.890
We are gonna have to operate
without family consent.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.239
Well, I have something
you should see.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.720
I may have found
a family member, though it's

29:25.851 --> 29:27.374
not the kind
any of us hoped to find.

29:27.461 --> 29:30.986
He has a record
of domestic violence.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.816
Cade went to find
the girl's family

29:34.990 --> 29:36.905
- out at Black Shoals Park.
- Oh, no.

29:37.079 --> 29:38.864
<i>Your call has</i> <i>
been forwarded to an automated</i>

29:38.994 --> 29:40.996
<i>- voice message system.</i>
- What's going on?

29:41.170 --> 29:42.432
Winston, call the police.
We need to get them

29:42.563 --> 29:44.565
to Cade's location.

30:35.921 --> 30:38.924
The cellulitis is expanding
beyond even the most recent

30:39.054 --> 30:40.839
marker,
her blood pressure's borderline.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.666
It's more swollen than before.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.017
- And these blisters are new.
- We can't wait any longer.

30:45.147 --> 30:48.672
- I don't know that we'll get parental consent.
- It's life or death now.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.675
Then Chastain will take
the risk.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.982
Let's prep her for surgery.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.465
<i>Your call has</i> <i>
been forwarded to an automated</i>

30:58.639 --> 31:00.075
<i>voice message...</i>

31:33.369 --> 31:35.110
Uh...

31:35.197 --> 31:36.720
I'm sorry.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.897
I... It's okay.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.464
Do you have a few dollars?

31:41.551 --> 31:43.684
I'm really hungry.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.991
Of course.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.909
Maybe you can help me.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.519
I'm looking for a family.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.303
They're possibly living
in their car.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.784
- Have you seen any...?
- Can you help me?!

31:56.915 --> 31:59.439
Are you okay?

31:59.569 --> 32:02.529
M-My car, it was struck
by lightning. I-I'm hurt.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.574
That's Ana.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.794
Do you have a sister
around eight years old?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.665
She has dark hair.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.885
That's Scout! That's Scout!

32:11.016 --> 32:12.843
She disappeared a few days ago.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.715
- Please...
- She's at the hospital.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.979
Let's get you there, too. Okay?

32:21.548 --> 32:23.419
These blisters
are developing rapidly.

32:23.506 --> 32:24.899
It means the infection
is moving fast.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.032
Then we need to move faster.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.773
Making the initial incision now.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.233
Let's start the debridement.

32:54.407 --> 32:55.930
We're looking
for healthy tissue.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.584
How deep do we need to go?

32:57.671 --> 32:58.977
Until we find some.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.979
Forceps to me.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.462
Better get equipment

33:06.636 --> 33:08.551
for a below-the-knee amputation
just in case.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.988
Amputation?

33:10.075 --> 33:11.641
She's just a child.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.296
It's a precaution.
We have to be ready.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.268
Been calling you nonstop.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.747
- Why didn't you pick up?
- This is Ana,

33:30.834 --> 33:33.098
our minor's older sister.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.447
She's hypothermic
with a wrist fracture.

33:34.577 --> 33:35.883
Where's Scout?

33:36.014 --> 33:38.320
- She's in surgery.
- What?

33:39.321 --> 33:41.019
Let's just focus
on you right now, okay?

33:41.193 --> 33:44.022
Clara? Page Winston.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.466
I've got clean margins,

33:53.553 --> 33:57.687
but the infection is close
to the anterior tibial artery.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.298
If we compromise that,

33:59.385 --> 34:01.343
we risk
seeding the infection further.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.564
We'd have to amputate.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.131
So let's not.

Change of plans, people.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.989
Dr. Haircut
will be observing us today

35:22.163 --> 35:24.774
very much the way a music stand

35:24.861 --> 35:26.994
observes the first chair violin.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.083
Silent and invisible.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.564
It's time to rest now.

35:31.651 --> 35:37.004
<i>♪ As long as you keep me</i> <i>
right next to you.</i>♪

35:40.050 --> 35:43.228
Winston,
how's the surgery going?

35:43.315 --> 35:45.317
Not my area,
but it's still touch and go.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.536
Please, I-I really just need
to see my sister.

35:47.623 --> 35:50.235
We will take you to her
as soon as we can.

35:50.409 --> 35:53.760
Scout wouldn't speak
or tell us her name.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.415
She hasn't talked
since our mom disappeared.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.853
Can you start
from the beginning?

36:00.027 --> 36:01.855
We're from Memphis.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.988
Father said our mom ran off.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.514
I don't believe it.

36:08.688 --> 36:11.343
She wouldn't.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.519
He beat her.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.521
And me.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.045
And when he hit Scout,

36:18.176 --> 36:20.613
I stole the car,
and we ran away.

36:20.787 --> 36:24.051
We were living in the car
when that storm came,

36:24.225 --> 36:27.272
and, uh, the lightning hit,

36:27.359 --> 36:29.796
and I don't remember anything
after that.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.015
When I came to,

36:32.190 --> 36:34.409
Scout was gone.

36:37.238 --> 36:40.067
I'm your social worker,

36:40.154 --> 36:43.549
and I will figure out
how best to take care of you.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.290
Please, you...

36:45.377 --> 36:47.292
You won't call our father,
will you?

36:47.466 --> 36:48.989
No, you won't be returned
to an abusive home.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.426
That's certain.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.230
Hey. I'm here.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.755
We're safe.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.800
Everything's gonna be okay.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.411
Ana.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.543
Hey.

37:21.674 --> 37:22.805
She speaks.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.550
She does, indeed.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.861
They saved you.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.733
Thank you.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.474
You are very welcome.

37:39.648 --> 37:42.260
Your leg will heal.
You'll have quite the scar,

37:42.434 --> 37:44.262
but otherwise,
you'll be just fine.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.352
One more thing.

37:47.482 --> 37:50.442
My daughter said
I could give this to you.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.907
So, I think

38:20.994 --> 38:22.778
they complete my drip
rather well, don't you think?

38:24.780 --> 38:26.869
This is officially the hardest
I've ever had to work

38:27.043 --> 38:28.741
for a sale.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.873
Ms. Cabot,

38:31.047 --> 38:33.746
just want you to know that
your surgery went flawlessly.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.791
I expect a full recovery
very soon.

38:35.965 --> 38:40.056
However, there is
one important open question.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.759
Do these come in 13?

38:46.846 --> 38:50.806
You two sure know
how to make a girl feel special.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.809
I made a referral for you
for Dr. Frank.

38:53.896 --> 38:56.508
She's an obesity specialist.
I know her personally.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.727
She creates individualized plans
for her patients

38:58.814 --> 39:01.339
that include genetics,
environmental factors

39:01.513 --> 39:03.253
and even metabolic function.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.778
And she can get you
into a treatment program

39:05.865 --> 39:06.996
for the bulimia.

39:07.083 --> 39:10.086
It's a combination
of therapy and SSRIs.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.827
So no more judgment.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.221
No more
one-size-fits-all medicine.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.571
You know, I do love my couture.

39:19.313 --> 39:22.447
Being caught in a storm
nearly killed those two girls.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.231
But running away
may have saved their lives.

39:24.318 --> 39:26.189
These are the kind of choices
no kid should have to make.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.278
- They needed help.
- Well,

39:28.453 --> 39:30.977
their access to social services
may have been limited.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.545
Chances are they would've been
returned to their father.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.245
Tell me they won't be separated.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.420
I will bend heaven and earth

39:39.594 --> 39:41.030
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.684
Thank you, Winston.

39:46.688 --> 39:49.256
This case got personal for you,
didn't it?

39:49.343 --> 39:51.040
Got personal for all of us.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.607
A child not willing to open up

39:52.694 --> 39:54.522
even to those
who wanted to help her.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.568
- A child on the run...
- Okay, full disclosure,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.265
I'm beginning to enjoy
your company.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.788
We work well together.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.703
But I do not enjoy
being psychoanalyzed.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.271
- Psychoanalyzed? Really?
- Just no third degree.

40:04.358 --> 40:05.620
Offering you my umbrella?

40:05.707 --> 40:07.230
Did that feel
like the third degree to you?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.841
I'm not a minor in your ER.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.756
I'm an adult
who can make her own decisions.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.149
And I'm your colleague.
I helped you get this job.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.197
Are you in trouble?

40:18.633 --> 40:20.026
No.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.290
I'm fully in control
of my past, present

40:23.377 --> 40:25.031
and, to some extent, my future.

40:25.118 --> 40:27.555
If I need help, I will ask.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.211
But will you?

40:31.385 --> 40:34.519
I'll see you around, Hawkins.

40:36.521 --> 40:40.307
So, what should we do
on our day off?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.831
We can go have lunch in Roswell.

40:42.918 --> 40:46.182
- Or we can go for massages.
- Dev.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.881
Well, we could quit our jobs

40:49.055 --> 40:52.188
and go live in the Maldives
before they sink.

40:54.930 --> 40:57.846
My schedule changed.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.979
I have to do a valve replacement
with AJ,

41:00.109 --> 41:01.981
and then Billie and I
have a schwannoma resection

41:02.111 --> 41:03.243
later tonight.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.419
Don't be angry.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.771
I'm not angry.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.947
I'm worried, though.

41:12.121 --> 41:13.732
Do Billie and AJ know

41:13.819 --> 41:15.385
that you want to be
double board-certified

41:15.560 --> 41:16.778
in the hardest field
of medicine,

41:16.909 --> 41:19.128
neuro and cardiothoracic surgery?

41:19.259 --> 41:21.087
Yes.

41:21.174 --> 41:23.655
I've mentioned
that I want to do this.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.918
And did they think
you can do it?

41:26.005 --> 41:28.137
No.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.923
They didn't take me seriously.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.402
<i>Are</i> you serious?

41:32.577 --> 41:35.057
Have you thought it through?

41:36.102 --> 41:38.452
There's a reason
why no one else has done it.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.933
Can you please just support me?

41:41.107 --> 41:43.370
I support you
in every dream you want to chase

41:43.544 --> 41:45.764
as long as it's not impossible.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.375
Leela,

41:48.549 --> 41:51.378
this is literally impossible.

41:52.422 --> 41:55.730
Even for the most talented
surgical resident in the world,

41:55.817 --> 41:58.298
and I'm ready to say
that that is you.

Did I tell you how sexy it is
that you stood up to Dr. Austin

42:07.525 --> 42:09.135
and lived to tell it?

42:09.309 --> 42:11.398
It was a conversation.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.356
I didn't wrestle him
to the ground.

42:13.443 --> 42:15.489
Don't shortchange yourself.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.536
You advocated for your patient.

42:18.710 --> 42:21.582
I find that incredibly sexy.

I have good news.

42:35.161 --> 42:36.771
I could use some.

42:36.945 --> 42:39.382
I extracted a promise
from the lieutenant governor

42:39.557 --> 42:42.037
to assure your anonymity.

42:42.211 --> 42:45.301
You can testify to him
and the whole board.

42:45.432 --> 42:46.912
When?

42:47.086 --> 42:49.131
Today. 2:00 p.m.

42:50.176 --> 42:52.874
I cleared your schedule.
No sense delaying.

42:53.005 --> 42:56.399
I've been private
about this for so long.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.663
Are you sure you're ready?

43:00.012 --> 43:02.101
You should know
there's still danger.

43:02.188 --> 43:04.930
Porter is powerful
within the medical community,

43:05.104 --> 43:07.802
and Randolph told me
he and the lieutenant governor

43:07.889 --> 43:09.630
were in the same fraternity
in college.

43:09.804 --> 43:11.676
So this is a boat

43:11.850 --> 43:13.591
- that could spring a hundred leaks.
- Yes.

43:13.765 --> 43:15.244
But he also told me

43:15.418 --> 43:17.464
there are other ethics
complaints against Porter.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.422
After your testimony,

43:19.509 --> 43:20.902
they may take those seriously.

43:21.033 --> 43:22.991
I hope so.

43:23.078 --> 43:24.602
It's still risky.

43:25.341 --> 43:27.430
I know.

43:28.475 --> 43:29.868
And you're determined?

43:30.042 --> 43:31.696
I am.
