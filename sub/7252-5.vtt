10:44.018 --> 10:45.770
MOM DOESN'T NEED A MARTINI.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.398
I'LL TAKE WHAT YOU GOT.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.567
WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE

10:48.440 --> 10:50.567
MINISTER IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

10:50.609 --> 10:51.734
YOUR HANDS ARE EMPTY.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.027
THE DOOR TO THE STUDY

10:51.776 --> 10:53.027
IS LOCKED.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.904
HE LOCKED THE STUDY?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.990
MOM, REALLY, I DON'T NEED GIN.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.990
I'LL TAKE WHATEVER YOU HAVE.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.743
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.743
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.412
I'M NOT GOING TO LET

11:00.785 --> 11:02.412
RICHARD'S BUSINESS TRIP

11:02.454 --> 11:04.456
KEEP YOU FROM HAVING THE DRINK

11:02.454 --> 11:04.456
YOU WANT.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.249
GRANDMA, WAIT.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.630
SHOULD WE REALLY

11:09.752 --> 11:11.630
BE DOING THIS?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.672
OH, THAT HE CAN LIVE

11:11.671 --> 11:13.672
IN THIS SQUALOR.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.092
IT'S ANOTHER CALCUTTA.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.092
IS THAT OPEN SEWAGE?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.802
IT CERTAINLY SMELLS LIKE A SEWER

11:16.134 --> 11:17.802
IN HERE.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.554
IT'S HIS CIGARS.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.554
THAT'S THE SMELL.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.556
IT'S MORE THAN CIGARS.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.556
IT'S DEBAUCHERY.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.682
DAD MENTIONED HE HAD

11:21.598 --> 11:23.682
THE BARBI TWINS UP HERE.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.853
HE AND HIS BUTLER HAVE A LITTLE

11:23.724 --> 11:26.853
"AUTO FOCUS" THING GOING ON.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.146
WELL, THE DRINK CART'S

11:26.894 --> 11:28.146
OVER THERE, GRANDMA.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.064
WE CAN GRAB THE GIN

11:28.188 --> 11:30.064
AND VAMOOSE.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.442
NO, SHE'S GOT VAMOOSE, REMEMBER?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.442
IT'S THE GIN WE NEED.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.402
HE MUST HAVE FIVE PACKS

11:32.484 --> 11:34.402
OF BREATH MINTS HERE.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.779
WHY WOULD A MAN NEED FIVE PACKS

11:34.444 --> 11:36.779
OF BREATH MINTS?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.906
IT COULD BE THE GORGONZOLA

11:36.821 --> 11:38.906
AND ONION DIET HE'S ON.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.408
IT HAS ITS DRAWBACKS.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.577
GRANDMA, I FEEL KIND OF WEIRD

11:40.450 --> 11:42.577
SNOOPING LIKE THIS.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.871
THIS IS MY PROPERTY

11:42.619 --> 11:44.871
AS MUCH AS HIS,

11:44.912 --> 11:46.540
AND WHEN WE DIE, IT'LL BE YOURS.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.041
WE'RE ALL ENTITLED HERE.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.626
HE'S GOT SOME NEW BOOKS.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.670
HEY, MY PETUNIA PIG PLATE

11:49.668 --> 11:51.670
AND SPOON.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.129
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.714
ODDS AND ENDS WOUND UP OUT HERE

11:53.171 --> 11:55.714
OVER THE YEARS.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.385
THIS IS NOT AN ODD NOR AN END.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.385
I'M TAKING IT.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.511
IT'S NOT YOURS TO TAKE.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.887
DAD'S NOT USING MY SPOON.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.305
I SAY TAKE IT.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.349
HEY, MOM, WHAT ARE WE CARRYING

12:02.347 --> 12:04.349
OUR BOOTY HOME IN?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.767
DO YOU HAVE A CANVAS BAG

12:04.391 --> 12:06.767
WITH A BIG DOLLAR SIGN ON IT?

12:06.809 --> 12:09.979
JUST TO REMIND YOU, THE

12:06.809 --> 12:09.979
DRINK CART IS RIGHT OVER HERE.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.190
OH, AND I THINK I SPOT GIN.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.190
IT'S BROWN, RIGHT?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.359
I LOVE THAT YOU THINK THAT.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.359
LOOKING FOR SKELETONS?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.734
I'M JUST LOOKING.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.238
OH, MAN. I SPILLED A TON

12:15.776 --> 12:18.238
OF SCOTCH ON MY SKIRT.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
WHO'S NOT CLOSING

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
THESE BOTTLES?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.325
OH, MY GOD.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.325
DID YOU REALLY FIND

12:20.240 --> 12:22.325
A SKELETON?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.077
GIN -- IT'S CLEAR,

12:22.367 --> 12:24.077
IT'S IN MY HAND,

12:24.118 --> 12:25.953
AND IT LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH

12:24.118 --> 12:25.953
FOR A MINISTER.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.873
OH, MY GOD.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.873
WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.375
BRIGHT.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.375
AND TASTEFUL.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.669
IT'S A VEST.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.669
GRANDPA HAS LOTS OF VESTS.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.337
IT'S GOT GLITTER.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.337
IT'S A GLITTER VEST.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.922
SO?

12:35.963 --> 12:38.007
WHERE WOULD YOUR FATHER WEAR

12:35.963 --> 12:38.007
A VEST LIKE THIS?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.926
CERTAINLY NOWHERE

12:38.049 --> 12:39.926
HE EVER WOULD'VE TAKEN ME.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.344
GRANDMA, IT'S JUST A VEST.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.304
THERE'S TONS OF PLACES

12:41.386 --> 12:43.304
HE WOULD WEAR THAT.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.014
NAME ONE.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.014
OKAY, I'M AT A LOSS.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.600
THIS IS INSANE.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.893
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE

12:46.641 --> 12:48.893
UNWANTED THINGS CAME TO REPOSE.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.895
MAYBE IT'S A VEST OF HIS

12:48.935 --> 12:50.895
FROM THE OLD DAYS.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.855
OUR DAYS NEVER INCLUDED

12:50.937 --> 12:52.855
RICHARD DRESSING UP

12:52.897 --> 12:55.066
LIKE THAT GAY FELLOW

12:52.897 --> 12:55.066
WHOSE TIGER TRIED TO EAT HIM.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.944
I HAVE DEFINITELY,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.944
POSITIVELY NEVER SEEN THIS VEST.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.613
THIS IS A PARTY VEST.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.822
JUST PUT IT BACK, MOM,

12:59.654 --> 13:01.822
AND LET'S GO.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.822
YOU PUT IT BACK.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.367
WE'VE MOVED A LOT OF STUFF.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.367
WE'VE GOT TO COVER OUR TRACKS.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.784
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

13:05.826 --> 13:07.662
IN THE MIDDLE,

13:05.826 --> 13:07.662
AS IF HE WAS HIDING IT FROM ME.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.247
CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.247
IT'S HIDEOUS.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.040
HOW DARE HE HAVE A VEST

13:09.289 --> 13:11.040
LIKE THAT.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.167
OKAY, THE MINTS LOOKED SOMETHING

13:11.082 --> 13:13.167
LIKE THIS, RIGHT?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.335
THAT DEVIOUS MAN.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.713
COME ON, MOM, LET'S GO.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.964
MOM, PETUNIA PIG.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.798
GRAB IT.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.271
I HAVE NEVER SEEN GRANDMA

13:31.728 --> 13:33.271
SO SINGULARLY OBSESSED

13:33.313 --> 13:35.022
ABOUT A PIECE OF CLOTHING.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.776
NOT SINCE I WORE MY "GAS, GRASS,

13:35.064 --> 13:37.776
OR ASS -- NO ONE RIDES FOR FREE"

13:37.816 --> 13:39.694
T-SHIRT TO THE JUNIOR LEAGUE

13:37.816 --> 13:39.694
SPRING TEA.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.904
HERE WE GO.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.904
BOYSENBERRY PIE WITH ICE CREAM.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.615
HOT FUDGE SUNDAE.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.615
HALF A GRAPEFRUIT.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.865
I DON'T WANT A GRAPEFRUIT.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.326
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.326
KINDA MY POINT.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.286
IT'S TOO LATE FOR HER,

13:46.367 --> 13:48.286
BUT NOT FOR YOU.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.788
THE SERVICE IS VERY RUDE.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.788
NO TIP FOR YOU.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.790
IN FACT,

13:49.828 --> 13:51.790
HE OWES US A LOT OF MONEY

13:51.830 --> 13:54.167
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO

13:51.830 --> 13:54.167
BE TIPPING HIM ALL THESE YEARS.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
CUSTOMARILY,

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TIP

13:56.043 --> 13:57.754
THE PROPRIETOR

13:56.043 --> 13:57.754
OF AN ESTABLISHMENT.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.213
WHY HAVE WE

13:57.796 --> 13:59.213
BEEN TIPPING HIM?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.465
WE LIKE HIM?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.465
OH, THAT.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.008
BRING US SOME COFFEE,

14:02.049 --> 14:04.385
AND I PROMISE THIS GRAPEFRUIT

14:02.049 --> 14:04.385
WILL BE EATEN.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.053
OKAY.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.347
HOW LONG IS MY NOSE?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.347
VERY.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.140
WHAT'S WITH THE SCARFING?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.849
I FIGURED

14:09.182 --> 14:10.849
SINCE IT'S STILL EARLY

14:10.891 --> 14:13.186
I'D STOP BY DEAN'S NEW PLACE

14:10.891 --> 14:13.186
REAL QUICK AND SAY HI.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.437
IS THAT OKAY?

14:13.227 --> 14:14.437
OH, YEAH.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.854
SO HE'S OUT OF THE PARENTS'?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.607
HE'S SLEEPING

14:15.896 --> 14:17.607
ON HIS FRIEND KYLE'S COUCH.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.275
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.069
WE COULD CALL HIM AND HAVE HIM

14:19.317 --> 14:22.069
MEET US HERE IF YOU WANT.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.655
REALLY?

14:22.111 --> 14:23.655
YEAH.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.407
PLENTY OF PIE, ICE CREAM,

14:23.697 --> 14:26.407
GRAPEFRUIT TO GO AROUND.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.369
IF WE TWIST HIS ARM, I BET LUKE

14:26.449 --> 14:29.369
WILL THROW IN SOME RAW SPINACH.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.412
I DON'T THINK

14:29.410 --> 14:31.412
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.122
SO SKIP THE SPINACH.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.122
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.582
NO. WHAT?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.125
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WEIRD

14:34.624 --> 14:36.125
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.168
NO, IT HASN'T.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.795
MOM.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.795
I JUST RAN INTO HIM TODAY.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.796
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.631
YEAH.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.631
HE SAID IT WAS WEIRD.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.550
WELL, THEN IT WAS ONLY WEIRD

14:41.673 --> 14:43.550
ON HIS SIDE,

14:43.591 --> 14:45.092
'CAUSE IT WASN'T ON MINE.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.554
HEY, HOW ABOUT I COME ALONG

14:45.134 --> 14:47.554
WITH YOU TO KYLE'S?

14:47.595 --> 14:49.472
HE'S BACK

14:47.595 --> 14:49.472
FROM THE NAVY, RIGHT?

14:49.514 --> 14:51.474
WE COULD ALL HANG OUT

14:49.514 --> 14:51.474
AND HEAR HIS STORIES.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.560
HE COULD TEACH US

14:51.516 --> 14:53.560
SOME SEA CHANTEYS,

14:53.601 --> 14:56.270
AND I COULD TELL DEAN

14:53.601 --> 14:56.270
HOW NOT WEIRD THE SITUATION IS.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.356
THAT'S HOW UNWEIRD IT IS FOR ME.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.356
I'D DO THAT.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.733
NO.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.733
THAT'D BE WEIRD, TOO.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.275
I DON'T LIKE IT THIS WAY.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.318
I KNOW.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.195
WE ALL USED TO GET TOGETHER

15:04.237 --> 15:07.323
ALL THE TIME FOR WHATEVER

15:04.237 --> 15:07.323
AND HANG OUT.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.700
WE HAD A GREAT RHYTHM.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.410
I LIKE DEAN.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.410
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED DEAN.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.912
HE HAS A GREAT HEART.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.912
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE WEIRD.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.706
NEITHER DO I.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.706
DEAN DOESN'T EITHER.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.752
WELL, THEN,

15:14.748 --> 15:18.752
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?

15:18.793 --> 15:19.836
LET'S ALL HOOK UP THEN.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.379
ALL WHO?

15:19.878 --> 15:21.379
ALL OF US.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.214
YOU KNOW -- THE GANG --

15:21.421 --> 15:23.214
THE FEARSOME FOURSOME.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.258
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.258
HOW DOES WHAT SOUND?

15:25.299 --> 15:27.385
DOING SOMETHING WITH RORY

15:25.299 --> 15:27.385
TOMORROW NIGHT.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.053
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.053
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.514
WE CAN ALL DO SOMETHING

15:29.095 --> 15:31.514
TOGETHER.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.932
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.517
THERE'S A GROUND SWELL

15:32.973 --> 15:34.517
OF SUPPORT.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.102
LET'S DO IT.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.102
OKAY, IF YOU WANT.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.896
YEAH, WE WANT, RIGHT?

15:36.143 --> 15:37.896
YEAH. WE WANT.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.938
GO RUN IT PAST DEAN.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.356
I'M SURE I CAN PERSUADE HIM.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.900
GOOD.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.900
YEAH, GOOD.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.150
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.569
OKAY.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.569

21:08.350 --> 21:10.061
TO OPEN THE PANIC ROOM

21:08.350 --> 21:10.061
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.230
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT

21:10.103 --> 21:12.230
IF YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.982
JUST HANGING OUT HERE

21:12.271 --> 21:14.982
WITH MY CLOSE FRIEND TEX WATSON.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.192
THIS IS NOT A JOKING MATTER.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.944
CAN I TRUST YOU

21:16.234 --> 21:17.944
WITH THIS INFORMATION?

21:17.985 --> 21:20.780
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE IT TO

21:17.985 --> 21:20.780
SOMEONE ELSE, SOMEONE CLOSER.

21:20.821 --> 21:21.989
I CAN'T TRUST A NEIGHBOR.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.699
HOW ABOUT DAD?

21:23.741 --> 21:26.077
YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T COME

21:23.741 --> 21:26.077
TO MY RESCUE IF I WAS ON FIRE.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.870
BESIDES,

21:26.119 --> 21:27.870
THAT VEST OF HIS IS SO LOUD

21:27.912 --> 21:29.830
HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

21:27.912 --> 21:29.830
HEAR ME SCREAMING.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.290
OKAY, MOM.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.751
GIVE ME THE CODE,

21:31.331 --> 21:33.751
AND I WILL KEEP THE CODE SAFE.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.795
OKAY. HERE GOES.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.795
ARE YOU READY?

21:35.836 --> 21:36.963
PEN IS POISED.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.549
1, 1, 1...

21:40.591 --> 21:42.051
1, 1.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.262
IS THAT THE CODE

21:43.052 --> 21:44.262
IT CAME WITH?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.512
I DON'T KNOW

21:44.303 --> 21:45.512
HOW TO CHANGE IT.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.056
THE MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO

21:45.554 --> 21:47.056
SHOW ME,

21:47.098 --> 21:48.515
AND NOW IT'S THE CODE

21:47.098 --> 21:48.515
I'M STUCK WITH.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.017
DID YOU WRITE IT DOWN?

21:50.059 --> 21:52.228
BARRING AN ANEURYSM,

21:50.059 --> 21:52.228
I THINK I'LL REMEMBER IT.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.272
WELL, FACTOR IN AN ANEURYSM

21:52.270 --> 21:54.272
AND WRITE IT DOWN.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.397
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.816
OKAY.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.816
I'M WRITING IT DOWN.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.109
1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.735
DON'T SAY IT OUT LOUD.

21:59.777 --> 22:03.072
OUR FOOTBALL TEAM IS SO GREAT.

21:59.777 --> 22:03.072
WE WON, WON, WON, WON, WON.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.031
EVERYTHING'S A JOKE.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.699
THE MAN MIGHT HAVE OVERHEARD.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.327
I GOTTA GET OFF THE PHONE AND

22:05.741 --> 22:08.327
CHASE HIM DOWN AND WHACK HIM.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.328
HIDE THAT NUMBER.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.663
I WILL. GOODBYE.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.663
Goodbye.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.748
I'M BACK.

22:12.790 --> 22:16.460
THAT WAS MOM GIVING ME

22:12.790 --> 22:16.460
THE SECRET PANIC ROOM CODE.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.337
SHE SHOULD JUST GIVE IT

22:16.502 --> 22:18.337
TO GRANDPA.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.922
I SUGGESTED THAT,

22:18.378 --> 22:19.922
BUT SHE SCOFFED.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.258
THOSE TWO SHOULD JUST DIVORCE

22:19.964 --> 22:22.258
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.259
DON'T SAY THAT.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.135
I was just talking.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.678
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.805
THIS STANDOFF BETWEEN THEM

22:25.719 --> 22:27.805
ISN'T GOOD FOR ANYBODY.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.347
MOM'S GETTING MORE INSANE

22:29.389 --> 22:31.642
AND SHARING THE INSANITY WITH ME

22:29.389 --> 22:31.642
AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.227
DIVORCE IS NOT THE ANSWER.

22:33.269 --> 22:36.022
I CAN TELL YOU FOR A FACT

22:33.269 --> 22:36.022
THAT GRANDPA IS MISERABLE.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.650
HE AND JEEVES SEEM VERY HAPPY IN

22:36.063 --> 22:39.650
THEIR NEW MODERN RELATIONSHIP.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.401
GRANDPA MISSES GRANDMA

22:39.692 --> 22:41.401
TERRIBLY.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.279
Why?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.279
He say something like that?

22:43.321 --> 22:45.031
I JUST KNOW.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.031
How?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.074
YESTERDAY, WHEN WE HAD LUNCH

22:45.072 --> 22:47.074
ON CAMPUS,

22:47.116 --> 22:48.534
GRANDPA TOLD ME

22:47.116 --> 22:48.534
THAT HE FINISHED

22:48.575 --> 22:51.078
"DECLINE AND FALL

22:48.575 --> 22:51.078
OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE."

22:51.120 --> 22:52.330
HMM?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.330
YOU SEE?

22:52.370 --> 22:53.789
YOU WANT TO DE-MENSA

22:52.370 --> 22:53.789
THE REFERENCE?

22:53.831 --> 22:55.791
NO ONE SITS AT HOME ALONE

22:53.831 --> 22:55.791
READING THAT BOOK

22:55.833 --> 22:57.210
UNLESS IT'S

22:55.833 --> 22:57.210
A CLASS ASSIGNMENT.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.003
IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.297
IT'S A HONKING LONG BOOK.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.297
IT'S CLEARLY A CRY FOR HELP.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.589
YOU'RE VERY ANTI-INTELLECTUAL.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.758
He asked me if Grandma

23:02.631 --> 23:04.758
had taken her car in

23:04.800 --> 23:06.344
for its six-month service.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.637
HON, THAT'S CONCERN FOR HER CAR,

23:06.384 --> 23:08.637
NOT FOR HER.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.057
NO, THAT'S CONCERN ABOUT GRANDMA

23:08.679 --> 23:11.057
AND HER SAFETY.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.933
WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION THIS

23:11.098 --> 23:12.933
TO MOM?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.560
MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS

23:12.975 --> 23:14.560
PANICKED ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING

23:14.601 --> 23:16.937
AND THE NOW-INFAMOUS

23:14.601 --> 23:16.937
GLITTER VEST.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.480
I DON'T WANT TO OPEN

23:16.979 --> 23:18.480
A CAN OF WORMS.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.066
HOW WOULD THAT OPEN UP

23:18.522 --> 23:20.066
A CAN OF WORMS?

23:20.107 --> 23:22.318
I'D HAVE TO TELL HER

23:20.107 --> 23:22.318
I HAD LUNCH WITH HIM,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.402
A LUNCH I HAD PREVIOUSLY

23:22.360 --> 23:24.402
NOT INFORMED HER OF,

23:24.444 --> 23:26.989
AND THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HER

23:24.444 --> 23:26.989
JEALOUS AND DEFENSIVE.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.075
The less you tell Grandma,

23:27.031 --> 23:29.075
the better.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.535
BY GEORGE,

23:29.116 --> 23:31.535
I THINK SHE'S GOT IT.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.535
What?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.620
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BURN THAT

23:31.577 --> 23:33.620
INTO YOUR BRAIN

23:33.662 --> 23:35.622
SINCE YOU WERE A BABY,

23:33.662 --> 23:35.622
BUT YOU STUBBORNLY RESISTED.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.916
NOW A BREAKTHROUGH.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.416
SO 6:30, YOU SAID?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.127
BY THE GAZEBO.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.127
DRESS IS CAS.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.545
I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HATE

23:41.587 --> 23:43.463
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH GRANDMA

23:41.587 --> 23:43.463
AND GRANDPA.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.384
I KNOW, HON,

23:43.505 --> 23:46.384
BUT IT'S UP TO THEM TO FIX IT.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.467
I GUESS.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.844
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.888
OKAY.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.888
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.639
BYE-BYE.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.148
LORELAI?

23:59.397 --> 24:01.148
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.691
DID WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

24:02.733 --> 24:05.069
OH, NO, I JUST STOPPED BY TO

24:02.733 --> 24:05.069
PICK SOMETHING UP FOR MOM.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.070
APPARENTLY SHE'S NOT HOME.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.445
SHE'S AT A D.A.R. MEETING.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.073
SHE'S ALWAYS THERE

24:07.487 --> 24:09.073
MID-SATURDAY AFTERNOONS.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.116
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.909
OH, YEAH.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.909
I GUESS I FORGOT.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.412
MAYBE ONE DAY THE ENTIRE D.A.R.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.412
WILL GO COLLECTIVELY WIGGY

24:14.452 --> 24:16.496
AND MEET ON

24:14.452 --> 24:16.496
A LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.291
I DOUBT THAT.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.291
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.167
WATER, SODA?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.167
NO, NO, THANKS.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.167
I'M FINE.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.752
SEE YOU HAVE YOUR NOSE

24:20.209 --> 24:21.752
IN YOUR PROUST.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.836
YES, HAVE YOU READ HIM?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.671
OH, I TRIED ONCE.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.671
STRUCK OUT.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.590
WHOA.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.590
THAT'S A LOT OF CERTS.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.841
YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS --

24:27.883 --> 24:30.136
YOU PICK ONE UP,

24:27.883 --> 24:30.136
YOU FORGET YOU HAVE IT.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.679
YOU PICK UP ANOTHER.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.679
THE CYCLE CONTINUES.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.639
KIND OF LIKE ME AND MEN.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.141
WHAT?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.141
I DON'T KNOW.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.683
MOM WASN'T HERE,

24:35.182 --> 24:36.683
SO THERE WAS A VACUUM.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.518
AH.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.518
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.729
MY MAN

24:38.560 --> 24:40.729
IS WITH HIS SICK MOTHER,

24:40.771 --> 24:43.481
AND I'M KIND OF LEFT

24:40.771 --> 24:43.481
IN THE LURCH HERE.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.109
AH, YOUR LURCH

24:43.523 --> 24:45.109
LEFT YOU IN THE LURCH.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.526
HEY, IS THAT

24:45.151 --> 24:46.526
WHERE THAT'S FROM?

24:46.568 --> 24:48.654
YOU KNOW,

24:46.568 --> 24:48.654
LURCH ON THE "ADDAMS FAMILY"?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.488
'CAUSE HE WOULD LEAVE PEOPLE

24:48.695 --> 24:50.488
IN THE LURCH?

24:50.530 --> 24:52.699
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

24:50.530 --> 24:52.699
THE ETYMOLOGY OF LURCH.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.910
SO LURCH IS AWAY,

24:52.741 --> 24:54.910
YOU'RE BACK FROM YOUR TRIP.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.912
ANYTHING ELSE

24:54.952 --> 24:56.912
NEW WITH YOU?

24:56.954 --> 24:58.289
NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.374
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN SPENDING

24:58.331 --> 25:00.374
YOUR TIME LATELY?

25:00.416 --> 25:02.001
ANYTHING NEW AND FANCY?

25:02.042 --> 25:05.004
NOT REALLY.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.004
I JOINED A BARBERSHOP QUARTET.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.630
AHA!

25:05.045 --> 25:06.630
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "AHA"?

25:06.672 --> 25:08.757
AND WHAT DOES

25:06.672 --> 25:08.757
THE BARBERSHOP QUARTET ENTAIL?

25:08.799 --> 25:11.718
IT'S A MUSICAL GROUP.

25:08.799 --> 25:11.718
WE DRESS UP IN OUTFITS.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.761
AHA!

25:12.803 --> 25:13.846
STOP SAYING THAT.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.513
WHAT KIND OF OUTFITS?

25:15.555 --> 25:18.351
WELL, OLD-TIMEY PERIOD THINGS.

25:18.392 --> 25:19.393
STRAW HATS, VESTS?

25:19.435 --> 25:20.811
THAT KIND OF THING.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.147
AND DON'T SAY "AHA" AGAIN.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.147
IT'S LOUD.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.399
DAD, HAVE YOU TALKED

25:23.189 --> 25:25.399
TO MOM LATELY?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.942
YOUR MOTHER HAS

25:25.441 --> 25:26.942
NOTHING TO SAY TO ME.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.694
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.154
I'M SURE SHE'D BE INTERESTED

25:28.735 --> 25:30.154
IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

25:30.196 --> 25:31.155
LIKE THE QUARTET THING.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.614
WHY?

25:32.656 --> 25:34.700
YOU WERE TOGETHER 40 YEARS.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.452
SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS

25:34.741 --> 25:36.452
ABOUT WHAT I DO.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.162
DAD, YOU'RE STILL HER HUSBAND.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.456
AND IF YOU'RE FILLING

25:38.204 --> 25:40.456
YOUR NIGHTS WITH SOMETHING,

25:40.498 --> 25:43.250
I'M SURE SHE'D BE CURIOUS

25:40.498 --> 25:43.250
WHAT YOU'RE FILLING THEM WITH,

25:43.292 --> 25:46.128
AS YOU WOULD BE WITH HER.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.130
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

25:48.172 --> 25:50.548
I'LL TELL ROBERT TO TELL

25:48.172 --> 25:50.548
YOUR MOTHER YOU WERE HERE

25:48.172 --> 25:50.548
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.801
BYE.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.726
WHEN DID THE BATHROOM SINK

25:59.058 --> 26:00.726
STOP UP?

26:00.767 --> 26:02.353
IT JUST HAPPENED.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.353
I CALLED THE LANDLORD.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.353
HE'S ON IT.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.937
'CAUSE WE'VE GOT RIGHTS.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.937
THIS ISN'T RUSSIA.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.272
CAN I SCOOT IN HERE?

26:03.979 --> 26:05.272
SURE.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.149
DON'T BRUSH TOO HARD, DUDE.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.692
I'D SHOW YOU MY GUMS,

26:07.191 --> 26:08.692
BUT YOU'D PUKE.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.986
WHAT ABOUT FLOSSING?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.986
YOU MEAN THE SILENT KILLER?

26:11.028 --> 26:12.488
IT'S A ROPE OF DESTRUCTION.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.948
NOTHING'S SAFE ANYMORE.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.948
GENTLE LITTLE STROKES.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.326
WE STILL LACK

26:14.990 --> 26:17.326
BASIC NECESSITIES, MAN.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.328
WE'VE GOTTA GET A PLUNGER.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.328
YEAH.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.913
WANNA GO TODAY?

26:19.370 --> 26:20.913
HUH?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.164
TO GET A PLUNGER?

26:22.206 --> 26:24.542
I KNOW A STORE

26:22.206 --> 26:24.542
THAT SELLS 'EM USED.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.834
ZACH?

26:24.582 --> 26:25.834
YEAH?

26:25.876 --> 26:27.878
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.878
HUH?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.422
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.422
I'M TAKING IT BACK.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.131
TAKING WHAT BACK?

26:29.463 --> 26:31.131
I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR YOU.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.841
I WAS CONFUSED BEFORE,

26:31.173 --> 26:32.841
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.592
WE'RE ROOMMATES AND BANDMATES,

26:32.883 --> 26:34.592
AND THAT'S IT,

26:34.634 --> 26:36.053
AND THAT'S ALL

26:34.634 --> 26:36.053
IT'LL EVER BE.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.898
IS THAT THEM?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.898
YEAH,

26:45.812 --> 26:47.898
THAT'S STRETCH AND SKINNY.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.109
OH, MAN, HE'S WEARING

26:47.940 --> 26:50.109
NICE SLACKS.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.360
I DON'T THINK SO.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.320
THEY'RE CREASED.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.320
THAT EQUALS NICE?

26:53.362 --> 26:54.863
I HATE THAT.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.449
IT'S HARD ENOUGH

26:54.905 --> 26:56.449
GETTING DRESSED FOR A DATE.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.741
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA

26:56.490 --> 26:57.741
DOUBLE WITH PEOPLE,

26:57.783 --> 26:59.493
IT'S LIKE DRESSING

26:57.783 --> 26:59.493
FOR FOUR.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.370
WELL, BE THANKFUL YOU'RE NOT

26:59.535 --> 27:01.370
WEARING YOUR PENGUIN OUTFIT.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.871
THEN YOU REALLY WOULD HAVE

27:01.412 --> 27:02.871
BEEN OUT OF PLACE.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.498
THIS IS SO

27:02.913 --> 27:04.498
NOT A SLACKS EVENING.

27:04.540 --> 27:07.167
PLEASE STOP SAYING SLACKS.

27:04.540 --> 27:07.167
THAT WORD IS CREEPY.

27:04.540 --> 27:07.167
SORRY.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.295
AND DON'T MENTION

27:07.209 --> 27:09.295
THE "S" WORD TO THEM, OKAY?

27:09.336 --> 27:11.297
DEAN IS GOING TO BE

27:09.336 --> 27:11.297
UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH AS IT IS.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.424
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK

27:11.338 --> 27:13.424
THAT WE'RE JUDGING HIM,

27:13.466 --> 27:15.551
OR THAT YOU'RE INORDINATELY

27:13.466 --> 27:15.551
INTERESTED IN HIS PANTS.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.428
HI, HI.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.636
HI.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.597
DEAN.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.680
HI.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.765
OH, HI.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.142
WOW, THIS IS

27:21.807 --> 27:23.142
GOING TO BE FUN.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.851
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.851
HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.270
YEAH, GOOD.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.270
HOW YOU DOING?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.813
TOO BAD YOU WEREN'T

27:26.312 --> 27:27.813
HOLDING A TROPHY.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.398
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE

27:27.854 --> 27:29.398
A GREAT PICTURE.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.317
SO WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA?

27:31.358 --> 27:33.360
WE GRAB SOME TAKEOUT

27:31.358 --> 27:33.360
THEN HIT THE BLACK, WHITE,

27:31.358 --> 27:33.360
AND RED MOVIE THEATER.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.653
COOL.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.653
I MISS THAT PLACE.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.653
IT'S BEEN FOREVER.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.697
THEY'RE PLAYING A GREAT MOVIE

27:35.695 --> 27:37.697
TONIGHT. "COOL HAND LUKE."

27:37.739 --> 27:39.032
NOT TOO SHABBY.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.367
LET'S GO GET THE FOOD.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.119
WELL, GOOD TIMING.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.119
NO LINE AT JOJO'S.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.121
LET'S JUST GET THE STUFF

27:42.161 --> 27:44.121
AT MY PLACE.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.121
WHY?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.414
SAME KIND OF FOOD,

27:44.163 --> 27:45.414
BUT BETTER.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.040
YOURS IS WAY BETTER.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.917
THAT'S WHY WE'RE

27:47.082 --> 27:48.917
GOING TO JOJO'S.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.917
WHAT?

27:48.959 --> 27:50.336
ALLOW ME.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.336
TAKE IT.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.129
WE ALWAYS DO JOJO'S

27:50.377 --> 27:52.129
ON B.W.R. NIGHTS.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.797
THAT'S SHORT FOR BLACK, WHITE,

27:52.171 --> 27:53.797
AND RED MOVIE THEATER.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.549
I'M FOLLOWING IT.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.926
BECAUSE YOUR STUFF IS GOOD AND

27:55.591 --> 27:57.926
HAS TO BE EATEN PRETTY QUICKLY.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.553
IF IT SITS AROUND,

27:57.968 --> 27:59.553
IT STARTS TO SUCK.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.762
THAT'S TRUE OF ALL FOOD.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.222
AH, BUT NOT JOJO'S.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.516
JOJO'S SUCKS TO BEGIN WITH,

28:03.557 --> 28:05.225
SO IT'S NO WORSE

28:03.557 --> 28:05.225
WHEN YOU EAT IT LATER.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.145
IT'S A RELATIVITY THING.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.145
EINSTEIN AND WHATNOT.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.815
THE SECRET IS JOJO'S CHILI.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.815
THE CHILI ACTS AS A SEAL.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.526
JOJO'S BURGERS

28:11.857 --> 28:13.526
COULD TRAVEL TO CHINA,

28:13.567 --> 28:14.860
AND THEY'D STILL BE

28:13.567 --> 28:14.860
JUST AS GOOD.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.487
BECAUSE THEY START OFF BAD.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.487
GET IT?

28:16.529 --> 28:17.821
NOT REALLY.

28:16.529 --> 28:17.821
GOOD, THEN LET'S GO.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.198
PLUS, JOJO'S IS CHEAPER.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.200
'CAUSE IT SUCKS.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.200
I'M JUST SAYING.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.952
JOJO IS GOING TO BE SO EXCITED

28:21.241 --> 28:23.952
TO BE MAKING A SALE.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.455
HELLO?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.123
ARE THEY OPEN?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.123
THE SIGN SAID THEY WERE.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.958
HELLO?

28:28.165 --> 28:29.958
I HAVE A GUN!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.877
CHILL OUT, KIRK.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.877
WE'RE HERE FOR THE MOVIE.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.171
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO

28:31.918 --> 28:34.171
PAY OUT FRONT.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.171
YOU WEREN'T OUT FRONT.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.297
HERE'S $20.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.297
THAT'S TOO MUCH.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.632
KEEP THE CHANGE.

28:36.674 --> 28:38.509
YOU CAN GET IN 16 MORE PEOPLE

28:36.674 --> 28:38.509
FOR THAT.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.052
PUT IT TOWARDS

28:38.551 --> 28:40.052
THE POPCORN.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.470
LET'S SIT.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.470
YES, YES.

28:41.512 --> 28:43.138
OOH, LET'S TAKE BIG RED.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.431
YES, BIG RED.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.849
THAT'S THE NAME

28:44.473 --> 28:45.849
FOR THE COUCH.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.643
YEAH, THANKS.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.643
I KIND OF CAUGHT ONTO THAT.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.395
OH, SORRY.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.395
NO, NO, NO YOU GO.

28:49.436 --> 28:50.521
THAT'S OKAY.

28:49.436 --> 28:50.521
NO, THAT'S FINE.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.648
IT'S THE SAME

28:50.563 --> 28:52.648
DOWN HERE.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.400
COOL, WE HAVE

28:52.690 --> 28:54.400
A SHORT FEATURE TO START.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.902
"THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS

28:54.441 --> 28:56.902
TRY TO SIT ON THE COUCH."

28:56.943 --> 28:58.654
WHOA,

28:56.943 --> 28:58.654
I LOVE THE EMPTINESS.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.573
YEAH, MEANS WE CAN TALK

28:58.696 --> 29:00.573
DURING THE MOVIE.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.575
WOULD PEOPLE BEING HERE

29:00.614 --> 29:02.575
HAVE STOPPED YOU?

29:02.616 --> 29:04.702
WE WOULD HAVE HESITATED

29:02.616 --> 29:04.702
EVER SO SLIGHTLY.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.495
FOOD, FOOD!

29:07.538 --> 29:09.039
HELLO, EVERYBODY,

29:09.081 --> 29:11.917
AND WELCOME TO THE BLACK,

29:09.081 --> 29:11.917
WHITE, AND RED THEATER.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.460
HOW ARE WE ALL DOING TONIGHT?

29:13.502 --> 29:14.753
GOOD, KIRK.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.753
HOW ARE YOU?

29:14.794 --> 29:16.714
GOOD, I'M KIRK.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.425
I'M VERY PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT

29:16.755 --> 29:19.425
TONIGHT'S FEATURE PRESENTATION

29:19.466 --> 29:21.801
IS THE CLASSIC

29:19.466 --> 29:21.801
"COOL HAND LUKE."

29:21.843 --> 29:23.470
[ CHEERING ]

29:23.512 --> 29:25.055
BUT I'M DEEPLY SORRY TO REPORT

29:25.097 --> 29:27.140
THAT THE FIRST REEL

29:25.097 --> 29:27.140
OF THE MOVIE

29:27.182 --> 29:29.727
INEXPLICABLY CAUGHT FIRE

29:27.182 --> 29:29.727
EARLIER THIS EVENING.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.270
OH, NO!

29:29.768 --> 29:31.270
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

29:31.311 --> 29:33.105
WHEN RICHARD PRYOR IS

29:31.311 --> 29:33.105
YOUR PROJECTIONIST.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.607
I CAN STILL SHOW YOU THE FILM,

29:34.648 --> 29:36.650
BUT YOU'D MISS

29:34.648 --> 29:36.650
THE FIRST 25 MINUTES.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.860
I'D BE HAPPY TO RECAP

29:36.692 --> 29:38.860
WHAT YOU'D MISS,

29:38.902 --> 29:40.362
OR EVEN ACT IT OUT FOR YOU.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.322
I MUST SAY,

29:40.404 --> 29:42.322
I DO A WICKED GEORGE KENNEDY.

29:42.364 --> 29:45.242
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:42.364 --> 29:45.242
FIRST 25 MINUTES

29:42.364 --> 29:45.242
ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.203
I AGREE.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.203
BUT HAVING KIRK REENACT THINGS

29:45.284 --> 29:48.203
CAN BE PRETTY DISTURBING.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.080
HE TOTALLY RUINED

29:48.245 --> 29:50.080
"LAST TANGO IN PARIS" FOR ME.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.416
WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS

29:50.122 --> 29:52.416
IN PLACE OF "COOL HAND," KIRK?

29:52.458 --> 29:56.044
I CAN OFFER YOU ANYTHING FROM

29:52.458 --> 29:56.044
THE THEATER'S LIBRARY OF FILMS.

29:52.458 --> 29:56.044
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

29:56.086 --> 29:58.714
A SERIES OF GRAPHICALLY VIOLENT

29:56.086 --> 29:58.714
DRIVER'S EDUCATION FILMS

29:58.756 --> 30:00.674
OR "THE ADVENTURES

29:58.756 --> 30:00.674
OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING."

30:00.716 --> 30:01.925
PIPPI!

30:00.716 --> 30:01.925
YAY!

30:01.967 --> 30:03.927
PIPPI!

30:01.967 --> 30:03.927
"ANNIKA, IT'S PIPPI!"

30:03.969 --> 30:06.346
"PIPPI LONGSTOCKING" IT IS.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.346
ENJOY YOUR FILM.

30:06.388 --> 30:09.266
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE

30:06.388 --> 30:09.266
WE'VE SEEN "PIPPI LONGSTOCKING?"

30:06.388 --> 30:09.266
TOO LONG.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.102
THAT'S GOTTA BE ONE OF

30:09.308 --> 30:12.102
OUR MOST WATCHED FILMS EVER.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.102
OH, IT'S UP THERE.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.937
I'VE SEEN IT AT LEAST

30:12.144 --> 30:13.937
THREE TIMES WITH YOU TWO.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.981
ISN'T IT SOME KIND

30:13.979 --> 30:15.981
OF KIDS MOVIE?

30:16.022 --> 30:18.233
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.233
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE?

30:18.275 --> 30:19.610
NEVER.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.610
WE GOT US A "PIPPI" VIRGIN.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.320
I DIDN'T THINK

30:19.652 --> 30:21.320
THERE WERE ANY LEFT.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.071
AND IT'S NOT A KIDS MOVIE.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.491
IT'S A CLASSIC OF SURREALISM.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.491
AND BIZARRE CINEMATOGRAPHY.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.618
AND ATONAL SINGING.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.618
AND FORCED ACTING.
