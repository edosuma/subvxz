00:02.535 --> 00:03.937
( bell rings )

00:03.969 --> 00:06.806
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.676
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.645
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:15.782
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:15.815 --> 00:21.588
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:24.724
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.758 --> 00:27.694
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.727 --> 00:30.597
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.630 --> 00:34.200
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.234 --> 00:38.772
<i>* It's all right</i>

00:52.752 --> 00:56.089

00:58.625 --> 01:02.696
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:18.178 --> 01:20.246
( clears throat )

01:25.552 --> 01:28.621
As you know, this weekend
is our 4th of
July celebration.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.558
We have the Staff
versus Member games,

01:31.591 --> 01:35.362
followed by the Ms.
Liberty Pageant
and the Fireworks Ball.

01:35.395 --> 01:38.765
Sir, I was wondering,
can we switch
a game or two on the schedule?

01:38.798 --> 01:41.668
- What'd you have in mind?
- Instead of barrel jumping,

01:41.701 --> 01:43.503
I was thinking about
hopping over
girls in swimsuits

01:43.536 --> 01:48.108
- and calling it
bikini jumping.
- Barbarian.

01:48.141 --> 01:51.411
Slater, you're in charge
of the games. Do it right.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.380
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Carosi,

01:53.413 --> 01:55.749
no one's signed up
for the Ms. Liberty Pageant.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.419
Did you hear that, Mr.
Social Director?
Get her some bodies, Zack.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.622
- Can staff members enter?
- Absolutely.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.758
Show that true
patriotic spirit.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.394
The winner gets a $500
government savings bond.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.395
- I'm gonna enter.
- Me too.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.798
No you're not, Powers.
You're going as Uncle Sam.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.501
- Did you get
your costume yet?
- Yes, sir.

02:14.534 --> 02:18.304
Aside from this
studly physique,
you won't even know it's me.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.073
Good.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.244
Oh, ladies... ladies.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.647
Sign up for the Ms. Liberty
Pageant and you could
win a date with me.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.717
- No way.
- Put your home
phone numbers down.

02:33.586 --> 02:37.557
Zack, you're supposed to be
looking for contestants
not hitting on them.

02:37.590 --> 02:41.461
Jessie, here's the guest list
for today. And keep an eye
on the Thorndikes,

02:41.494 --> 02:46.099
they're
sneaking in twin guests
and only paying for one.

02:46.132 --> 02:50.170
Hey, Stacy?
Why don't you sign up
for the Ms. Liberty Pageant?

02:50.203 --> 02:53.106
- You're good looking.
- Why would I want to do that?

02:53.106 --> 02:55.642
I don't know. Dumb reasons,
like you'd be a part

02:55.675 --> 02:58.144
of the festivities
and it would be fun.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.147
Well,
I don't have time for fun.
I have work to do.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.150
Oh, come on. You always
have work to do. Lighten up.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.619
You would be
the perfect Ms. Liberty.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.656
- You really think so?
- Uh-huh. lf I were a judge,

03:09.689 --> 03:11.624
I'd vote for you.

03:11.658 --> 03:15.061
- Okay, let me think about it.
- All right. Catch you later.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.306
That's not right.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.408
What's not right?

03:28.441 --> 03:31.511
The tubes should go
before the beams,
not after them.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.580
Says who?

03:33.613 --> 03:36.816
Says last year's obstacle
course champion and
club record holder.

03:36.850 --> 03:41.654
If you race against me you're
not gonna be this
year's champion.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.090
Get real, honey.
You'll be brushing my sand

03:44.124 --> 03:46.126
out of your teeth
for a week.

03:46.159 --> 03:49.496
- Oooh, I am so scared.
- You should be.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.631
It's about time
you got this course done.

03:51.664 --> 03:54.634
Step aside
and watch a real jock.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.137
You're not a jock,
you're a joke.

03:58.204 --> 04:00.640
Laugh not, Curly,
I've been bulking up.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.243
Feast your eyes
on this massive muscle.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.782
Uh, I think you left
your muscle in
your sweatshirt.

04:08.815 --> 04:12.118
Okay. Watch me,
if your eyes are fast enough.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.257
Help! I'm stuck!

04:17.290 --> 04:18.757
Lisa: Good.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.528
( Screech screaming )

04:27.801 --> 04:31.771
Have you made up your mind,
ready to sign up for the Ms.
Liberty Pageant?

04:31.805 --> 04:34.107
I've never done anything
like this before.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.242
What if I get on stage
and forget how to talk?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.478
You?
Worried about talking?

04:38.511 --> 04:42.315
Just make believe
you're yelling at the staff.

04:42.349 --> 04:46.086
- I don't even have a costume.
- Look, I'll help you.
Just sign up.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.089
- Okay. Count me in.
- All right.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.726
Well, well, did I hear right?
My little girl

04:52.759 --> 04:55.195
is going to sign up
for the Ms. Liberty Pageant.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.697
Daddy, please don't
make a big deal about this.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.166
I'll be lucky if I make it
past the first round.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.304
Nonsense. You're a Carosi.
Like yeast,
we rise to the occasion.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.707
PA: <i>Ms. Carosi,</i>
<i>the Coast Guard just picked up</i>

05:07.741 --> 05:11.044
<i>one of our waiters</i>
<i>floating in a tube.</i>

05:11.077 --> 05:14.347
- Sounds like Screech to me.
- I'll go claim him.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.282
- Morris...
- I know, sir.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.185
An idle employee
is an unemployed
employee. I'm on my way.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.321
Relax, Morris.
Work will wait.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.356
- It will?
- Of course, come on.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.692
There's someone
I want you to meet.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.428
Hello, everyone.
Mr. Edgewater, did you hear?

05:28.461 --> 05:31.598
My little
daughter's gonna compete
in the Ms. Liberty Pageant.

05:31.631 --> 05:35.101
- I say,
that's wonderful, old man.
- I say so, too.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.271
But, I must disqualify myself
from being a judge.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.241
This fine young man
will take my place.

05:41.274 --> 05:44.310
- Me? A judge?
- Yes.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.514
Zack Morris,
Miles Edgewater.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.716
Hot!
Hot coffee!

05:54.154 --> 05:57.357
Zack, is it true you're
gonna be a judge for the
Ms. Liberty Pageant?

05:57.390 --> 06:00.660
- Boy, news travels fast.
- I'm gonna work
hard on my speech.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.397
That $500 savings bond would
come in handy for college.

06:04.431 --> 06:07.467
I bet it would.
See you later, Kelly.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.474
Hey, Zack? I don't
want you to vote for me

06:14.507 --> 06:17.177
just because
we've been friends
since we were little kids.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.412
- I won't.
- I want you to vote for me

06:19.446 --> 06:21.481
because of the importance
of what I have to say.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.616
Oh, and I can't wait
to hear it.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.526
Hey, Lisa,
what would you like?

06:33.560 --> 06:36.229
How about first place
in the Ms. Liberty Pageant?

06:36.262 --> 06:38.732
We're friends.
Got it, bub?

06:45.605 --> 06:48.375
I know it's going to be
hard to be objective

06:48.408 --> 06:51.644
judging the Ms. Liberty
Pageant with so many of
your friends in it,

06:51.678 --> 06:53.546
so I'll make it
easy for you.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.648
Stacy wins.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.252
Oh, boy.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.326
Come on, Stacy.
Let's see your Ms.
Liberty outfit.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.628
No.
It's too embarrassing.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.765
Oh, come on.
I bet you look
good in anything.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.571
I look like a firecracker,
don't I?

07:18.605 --> 07:22.442
No, but you could pass for
an extremely sexy
Harlem Globetrotter.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.178
- You're crazy.
- Maybe,

07:25.211 --> 07:28.481
but I do know
a hot pair of legs
when I see them.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.250
- Really?
- Yeah,

07:30.283 --> 07:32.385
and your smile's
not too shabby either.

07:32.419 --> 07:35.522
Are you working
the Zack Morris charm on me?

07:35.555 --> 07:37.824
Maybe...

07:37.857 --> 07:40.593
- how am I doing?
- Real good.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.497
Whoops!

07:44.531 --> 07:46.833
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

07:46.866 --> 07:51.271
No...
no, we were just standing
like that to see who's taller.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.741
Gee, judge,  wonder who
you'll be voting for tomorrow.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.776
Yeah, thanks
for stopping by, Slater.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.279
Don't let the doorknob
hit you on the way out.

08:00.847 --> 08:04.751
Well, better be going.
Big day tomorrow.

08:04.784 --> 08:08.154
- Lot's of things to do.
- Yeah, you're right. Big day.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.891
- Zack...
- Stacy...

08:11.925 --> 08:13.793
Stacy:
You first.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.796
Okay... um... I was wondering

08:16.830 --> 08:19.632
if you want to go
to the 4th of
July dance with me?

08:19.666 --> 08:22.902
- Well, sure, that'd be great.
- All right.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.638
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

08:26.806 --> 08:30.176
Stacy, wait. What were you
going to stay to me?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.480
Oh... well... uh...

08:33.513 --> 08:36.582
you are definitely
taller than I am.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.591
- ( patriotic music playing )
- ( crowd applauding )

08:57.771 --> 09:00.340
Hear ye, hear ye,
The Malibu Sands

09:00.373 --> 09:03.510
July 4th
celebration is upon us.
I now call forward

09:03.543 --> 09:06.646
Uncle Sam
to ring in the games.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.720
Powers, what are you doing?

09:13.753 --> 09:16.356
Screech, you're supposed
to be Uncle Sam.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.160
Well, I am. This is what
my Uncle Sam looks like.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.629
You're not supposed
to be your Uncle Sam.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.764
You're supposed
to be America's Uncle Sam.

09:24.798 --> 09:28.668
Great, now you tell me.
Next time a little
photograph would help.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.837
Just ring in the games.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.874
( bell ringing )

09:34.908 --> 09:37.210
So as my Uncle Sam would say,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.946
have fun, enjoy,
when do we eat?!

09:44.217 --> 09:47.620
Zack: Contestants,
line up for
the obstacle course.

09:48.955 --> 09:52.892
All right. We have Lisa Turtle
for the Members' team...

09:52.926 --> 09:55.962
( cheering )

09:56.062 --> 09:58.631
...and AC Slater
for the Staff team.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.868
- ( cheering )
- Zack: Yeah, yeah.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.937
- Are you guys ready?
- Absolutely.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.940
- You bet.
- All right.

10:06.973 --> 10:10.243
- You're history, honey.
- Eat my dust, Slater.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.411
( whistle blows )

10:35.435 --> 10:37.971
( cheering )

10:40.407 --> 10:43.910
Can I get you something to
rinse all that sand
out of your mouth?

10:44.944 --> 10:48.248
I lost. I lost bad.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.350
I lost to a girl.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.722
Wheelbarrow contestants,
are you ready?

10:55.755 --> 10:57.691
All: Yeah!

10:57.724 --> 11:01.327
Kelly, Jessie, I expect you
to take it easy on us.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.963
We're just
a couple of old fogies.
( laughs )

11:04.064 --> 11:05.965
Sure, Mr. Carosi.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.936
Elbows, whenever
you get the chance.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.339
Keep an eye peeled
for concealed weapons.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.775
All right.
On your mark,

11:15.809 --> 11:18.611
- get set...
- ( whistle blows )

11:35.695 --> 11:39.966
- That is so unfair!
- Yeah,
illegal use of a big body.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.003
Mercy, did I cause
an accident?

11:59.119 --> 12:01.054
Slater: Awww!

12:01.054 --> 12:04.924
Why, Lisa, what are you doing
in that cold muddy water?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.527
- I'll go get you a towel.
- Thanks.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.864
Jessie, look at Carosi.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.301
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.672
- On three.
- One, two, three.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.473
Heave!

12:25.979 --> 12:29.215
Oh, Mr. Carosi, I didn't
think the game was over.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.551
Both: Sorry.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.324
Here you go, Lisa.
Got you your towel.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.560
Thanks, Slater.
I've got
something for you too.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.395
What's that?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.568
Gotcha. Now we're even.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.971
Yeah, you're right.
We are even.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.342
Hey Lisa,
what do you say we go
to the dance together tonight?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.445
- I'd like that.
- Good,

12:58.478 --> 13:00.547
that way I can keep
my eye on you.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.219
The four finalists are:
Jessie Spano...

13:06.252 --> 13:09.823
- ( crowd applauding )
- Kelly Kapowski...

13:09.856 --> 13:11.925
Lisa Turtle...

13:13.426 --> 13:16.363
I can't believe it.
I'm so proud.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.232
...my own little darling,
Stacy Carosi.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.671
Now,
each of the finalists will
tell us what the 4th of July

13:24.704 --> 13:28.208
means to them.
First, Lisa Turtle.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.881
The 4th of July
means freedom, liberty,

13:34.914 --> 13:38.918
and 50% off sales
at all major
department stores.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.388
Perfect, Lisa.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.523
And now,
Jessie Spano.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.431
The 4th of July
means America.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.933
Our country.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.970
Well, actually
it's not our country.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.305
It belonged to the lndians
who inhabited...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.775
Thank you
for making us feel so proud.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.380
And now,
our next contestant...

14:07.414 --> 14:10.617
forgive me
for being moved,

14:10.650 --> 14:14.387
my daughter,
Stacy Carosi.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.894
To me the 4th of July
means a time of togetherness,

14:20.927 --> 14:24.798
a time of family and friends,

14:24.831 --> 14:27.867
fun and fireworks.
That's the 4th.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.908
Excuse me.
I just need a moment.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.713
- ( clears throat )
- Oh yeah, Kapowski.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.919
To me, the 4th of July
celebrates something

14:45.952 --> 14:48.355
that our ancestors
gave their lives for.

14:48.388 --> 14:52.525
Something that makes our
country stand apart from
so many others.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.961
Today,
on our nation's birthday,

14:54.994 --> 14:58.365
let us remember that one gift
that makes
America so special...

14:58.398 --> 14:59.799
freedom.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.439
Here we go.

15:06.473 --> 15:10.276
One vote
for Stacy Carosi.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.951
One vote
for Kelly Kapowski.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.189
Come on, Morris.
We're waiting.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.230
And the last vote
for the next Ms. Liberty,

15:30.964 --> 15:32.966
Kelly Kapowski?!

15:33.066 --> 15:35.735
( cheering )

15:46.346 --> 15:50.183
Congratulations, Stacy.
First runner-up is
a big responsibility.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.686
Hey, if a meteor hits Kelly,
you're in.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.689
I'll try to stay ready.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.926
Look at them
up there smiling, happy.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.328
It's almost as if
they never broke up.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.265
They used to go out together?

16:05.298 --> 16:08.702
Go out?
They were the hottest couple
since Betty and Barney Rubble,

16:08.735 --> 16:11.471
but she dumped him.
He always wanted her back.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.574
I guess voting for her
was the smart way of doing it.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.544
Pretty smooth
operator, huh?

16:17.577 --> 16:20.347
- Yeah, pretty smooth.
- ( thuds )

16:24.384 --> 16:26.653
Zack, I need to talk to you
about the dance.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.155
Sure. What time do you
want me to pick you up?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.890
Never. It's off.

16:30.924 --> 16:34.194
- Stacy... Stacy, wait.
- Not so fast, Morris.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.564
- I thought we had a deal.
- Well, I'm sorry, sir.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.467
I wanted to vote for Stacy,
but I had to be fair.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.370
Fair? I didn't make you
a judge to be fair.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.506
But, sir, Kelly was better.
I had to do the right thing.

16:46.539 --> 16:50.243
And so do I...
you're fired.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.784
So, big guy, I hear
Lisa's gonna be
your date tonight.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.853
Well, you heard right.

16:59.886 --> 17:03.656
Just remember this: every step
you take, every move you make,

17:03.690 --> 17:06.459
I'll be watching you.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.229
Thanks for sharing.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.598
- Hi, Slater.
- Lisa.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.599
Whoa, you look great.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.502
Yeah, thanks to you
I had a great mud bath.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.872
- Let's dance.
- Let's go.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.547
- Stacy, hi.
- Hi.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.450
You were really great today.
I wish we both could have won.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.285
Yes, well we both
didn't win, did we?

17:32.318 --> 17:34.320
And we both know why,
don't we?

17:34.788 --> 17:37.891
No, we both don't. Why?

17:37.924 --> 17:40.493
Because of your
boyfriend Zack.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.629
My boyfriend?
What are you talking about?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.631
Zack and I broke up
a long time ago.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.267
Screech told me you were
getting back together.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.804
Screech? Screech also said
that Elvis has

17:50.837 --> 17:52.939
a day-care center
for the Muppet Babies.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.411
The truth is,
Zack likes you.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.648
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.884
You know, being a judge
must have been
really hard for him.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.555
Thanks, Kelly. I'm sorry.
l'm gonna go find Zack.

18:10.724 --> 18:13.259
I voted for her, I should
still get that cabana.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.228
Not now,
we'll talk about it later.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.197
Daddy, have you seen Zack?
I need to talk
to him right away.

18:17.230 --> 18:21.401
Don't worry, I took care
of it. He's packing his
bags as we speak.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.570
Why? Where's he going?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.840
I fired him because he
wouldn't vote for you
like I told him to.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.743
Oops.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.745
Like I hoped he would.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.148
You tried to fix
the Ms. Liberty Pageant?

18:35.181 --> 18:38.551
Yes... I mean, no. I mean,
only because you
deserved to win.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.554
Daddy! How could you?

18:56.936 --> 18:59.673
- Peaceful, isn't it?
- Stacy.

18:59.706 --> 19:03.209
- What are you doing here?
- Do you mind if
I sit with you?

19:03.243 --> 19:06.713
No, I'm just surprised
you want to.

19:06.746 --> 19:10.784
Look, I'm really sorry
about how I acted.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.219
I got some
wrong information and I...

19:13.920 --> 19:16.756
No excuses. I apologize.

19:16.790 --> 19:21.227
I'm sorry too. I shouldn't
have pushed you into doing
the beauty pageant.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.397
No, I'm glad you
pushed me. I had fun.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.299
Really?

19:26.332 --> 19:28.768
Yeah, well, until they
announced the winner.

19:28.802 --> 19:32.205
But Kelly deserved to win.
Her speech was really good.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.241
Yeah, well, your father
didn't think so.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.444
My dad has a lot to learn,

19:37.477 --> 19:39.779
especially about
what a great guy you are.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.151
( slow music playing )

19:45.185 --> 19:47.620
You know, Screech,
you're a really good dancer.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.923
Thanks, Kelly,
but try not to fall for me.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.559
I'm only using you
to make Lisa jealous.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.229
It'll be hard,
but I'll do my best.

19:57.664 --> 20:01.401
There she is.
Hmm... pretend to kiss me.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.770
Screech,
that's a little too obvious.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.239
You're right.
Let's be sly about this.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.308
I'll put my head
on your shoulder.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.216
Hey, Lisa, this could be
my head on your shoulder.

20:16.249 --> 20:19.185
I know, I would
remove it with mace.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.597
Hey guys, check out
who just came in together.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.268
Morris,
what are you doing here?
I thought I fired you!

20:35.301 --> 20:38.438
Well, you did, Daddy,
but as assistant
manager I rehired him.

20:38.471 --> 20:42.308
I'd hate for him to sue you
for unfair dismissal.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.878
Sue me?
Can he do that?

20:45.945 --> 20:47.947
Yeah... yeah, he can do that

20:47.981 --> 20:49.983
and I bet you
he'd win big time, too.

20:50.016 --> 20:54.554
I can just see it now,
"The Zack Morris Beach Club."

20:54.587 --> 20:57.524
Now, look.
Can't we settle this
like two mature adults?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.659
Let's say I give you
your job back.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.695
Oh, no, I've already got that.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.764
How about the weekend off?

21:04.798 --> 21:06.733
Deal.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.402
The fireworks are starting,
everybody.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.504
Everybody outside!

21:22.916 --> 21:25.418
Happy 4th of July.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.421
Happy 4th of July.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.808
( instrumental music plays )
