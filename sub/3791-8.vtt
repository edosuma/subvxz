01:17.411 --> 01:20.329
I don't think you want
to go into that part of town,

01:20.414 --> 01:22.498
not alone.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.251
I'll go with you, Joe,
if you want.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.296
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.840
- Yeah, for real?
- Very natural.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.842
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get this one, I really do.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.553
You know, I feel like
it was written for me.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.846
I mean, with Eddie Burns
producing...

01:36.930 --> 01:39.390
I mean, the guy knows me
from back in the day.

01:39.475 --> 01:40.933
You sure that's
a good thing?

01:41.018 --> 01:43.603
Don't listen to him, Johnny,
I love the positivity.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.105
- Yeah, thanks, Vince.
- Look, you do sound good, Drama,

01:46.190 --> 01:48.983
but I wouldn't count on Eddie Burns
knowing you. You should focus.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.318
You're right,
you're right.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.987
Focused. Like a laser.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.074
No. No. Okay, sorry.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.411
Ari Gold's office.
No, n...

02:00.496 --> 02:01.496
Can I ask you
to hold please?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.456
What's up?
You look like hell.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.916
The phones have been
ringing off the hook.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.210
Everyone knows that
you took the new space.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.711
They're asking me
if we're a new major.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.420
Terrance signed the papers.
It doesn't matter.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.507
Just deny deny deny.
It'll all be over soon.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.801
You know I don't
like to lie, Ari.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.469
Lloyd, be a man.

02:16.553 --> 02:20.306
Or as much of a man as you can possibly
be for God fuckin' sakes.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.308
Now what's up
this morning?

02:22.392 --> 02:24.852
- Vince and the boys are on their way.
- It's gonna be a good day.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.562
A good day, Lloyd.
I can feel it.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.859
Ari Gold's office. No, I haven't heard
anything about that.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.152
No, I don't know
anything about that.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.282
I'll be here.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.076
You gonna make me
hang up there alone?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.870
Sorry, bro.
Audition's at 3:00.

02:43.831 --> 02:47.542
- I'm a laser.
- You're a retard, but okay.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.418
No, that is so not true.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.878
So not true!

02:50.963 --> 02:52.755
You guys can go right in.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.925
Ari Gold's office, please hold.
Ari Gold's office, please hold.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.928
I'll be out here
all alone.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.763
What's going on out there, Ari?
You having a telethon?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.474
Yeah, E. Raising cash
for the subordinates of movie stars

03:03.559 --> 03:04.767
who can't fend
for themselves.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.686
- Hardee-har-har.
- What's the big surprise, Ari?

03:06.770 --> 03:09.689
- Wow, getting right to it, huh, Vin?
- Last time you surprised me,

03:09.773 --> 03:11.732
I was fired, so naturally
I'm a bit anxious.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.026
Okay, here it is,
you remember "Queens Boulevard"

03:14.111 --> 03:15.778
that was supposed to be
released on six screens,

03:15.863 --> 03:17.530
so NYU students had something
to do on a Friday night?

03:18.448 --> 03:21.617
Turns out the studio has
decided to push the release.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.327
- Why?
- What the fuck?!

03:23.412 --> 03:24.787
Because they want
to release it wide

03:24.872 --> 03:28.332
on 1,200 motherfuckin'
screens! Boom!

03:28.417 --> 03:31.377
Turns out E's lucky pick
has been testing through the roof

03:31.461 --> 03:33.838
- and with the success of "Aquaman"...
- Two for two!

03:33.922 --> 03:37.466
It gets better. The Hollywood Foreign
Press wants to sit down with you,

03:37.801 --> 03:41.470
to discuss everything "QB," wanna have
a press conference this afternoon.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.139
Jesus, give me
a little less notice.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.974
When the Hollywood
Foreign Press calls,

03:45.058 --> 03:47.059
you run, Vinnie, okay?
Will you be there?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.769
- I'll be there...
- Will you do something for me?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.064
Will you smile? Will you look happy?
Will you look cooperative?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.025
Well, what exactly does
cooperative look like?

03:54.318 --> 03:56.736
Vin, we need this.
We want people to forget about

03:56.820 --> 03:59.989
the fact that you just got fired.
Will you smile?

04:02.659 --> 04:03.951
Oh, hey, Eddie.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.745
It's great
to see you too.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.413
Me?

04:07.497 --> 04:10.082
Thanks, yeah,
things are great, just great.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.627
Life is just so amazing,
isn't it?

04:14.046 --> 04:15.212
What the hell?

04:16.298 --> 04:20.509
Uh, maybe you didn't notice,
but I'm sitting in the car.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.178
I noticed.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.347
Obviously, you didn't notice
the meter needed feeding.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.974
What, no heads-up?
No tap on the window?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.809
Sorry, pal.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.395
The meter's red...
the car is dead.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.482
Civil servant?

04:34.566 --> 04:37.860
What the fuck is civil about not giving
a guy a warning? It's anti-American.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.153
I think that's in
the Bill of Rights.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.364
The point is, this isn't
Communist Russia.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.824
Communist Russia isn't Communist
Russia anymore either, Drama.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.076
You wanna fuckin' start, E?!

04:45.160 --> 04:48.287
Johnny, relax,
I'll pay for the ticket.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.331
That's not the point, Vince,
it's the principle.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.292
A guy should be able
to sit in his own car on a public street

04:53.377 --> 04:55.378
without being
unjustly harassed.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.015
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna fight for my rights.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.560
I'm gonna go down there, I'm gonna make
that guy's day a living hell.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.604
I thought you were a laser.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.898
- This won't affect me. You in?
Forget about him.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.358
Come on,
you're nervous.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.485
You always get uptight
when you have something big.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.196
You don't have to be.
You can get this if you stay focused.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.617
- Yeah, you're right.
- Right?

05:26.743 --> 05:30.204
Yeah. You're right, bro.
Thanks.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.706
All right, Turtle,
let's go get a cup of coffee,

05:31.790 --> 05:33.541
start heading west so I'm not late.
Thanks, Vince!

05:33.875 --> 05:35.251
- You betcha.
- Hey, good luck, Drama.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.335
Thanks, E.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.593
- See how calming I can be?
- Yeah, very impressive.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.013
- Now, what should we do?
- Call Walsh, let's celebrate.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.265
- No. Really?
- Yeah, he'll be happy to hear from you.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.517
Hillbilly Willy is starting to come on

05:51.601 --> 05:53.269
as he passes Marshal Tito in stride.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.813
Hillbilly Willy is starting
to come on...

05:56.106 --> 05:58.566
Suit! What a pleasant
fucking surprise.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.110
- How you doing, Billy?
I'm awful.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.862
Yeah, well, maybe this
will make you feel better.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.489
"Queens Boulevard" is gonna open
on 1,200 screens.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.533
Willy is closing fast...
- Yes!

06:07.617 --> 06:08.617
Run!

06:09.036 --> 06:10.828
Run, you fucking slag!

06:11.621 --> 06:12.621
Come on!

06:12.789 --> 06:14.248
Hello?

06:14.332 --> 06:16.000
Hillbilly winning by a nose!
- Fuck!

06:16.084 --> 06:17.918
What a finishing kick
on that horse!

06:19.129 --> 06:21.630
Fucking fillies, suit.
Never count on a broad.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.924
Did you hear me, Billy?
1,200 screens.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.134
Yeah, I fuckin' heard ya

06:25.218 --> 06:26.343
and I already
know all about it.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.596
Why do you think I'm out
blowing all my money

06:28.680 --> 06:31.098
on booze and ponies?
I'm depressed as shit.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.017
Depressed?
Billy, this is good news.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.394
No, it ain't, suit.
And it ain't gonna happen either.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.730
I'm slapping those fucks
with an injunction.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.816
I'm gonna make sure
that film never sees the light of day.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.360
Jesus Christ, Billy. He's trying
to kill the release of the movie.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.487
- What? Why?
- Why?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.239
Because I'm not gonna
let those douche bags

06:47.324 --> 06:49.492
Aquaman-ify my movie.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.827
Billy, where are you?
We're gonna come see you.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.454
Meet me at my girl's.
I gotta go home

06:53.538 --> 06:55.331
and tell her I lost
the rent money again.

06:55.499 --> 06:56.832
ARl: It's not true, Shauna!

06:56.917 --> 06:59.126
Tell "Variety" they
can suck my balls,

06:59.211 --> 07:00.836
but clean it up.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.340
You Indian now, Lloyd?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.093
Jesus, you can see this?

07:07.511 --> 07:10.638
This lying is making me break out.
God, and I have a date tonight!

07:10.931 --> 07:13.641
Well, I'm sure your date will pop
that with his pecker, don't worry.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.684
Tell me why you came
in here or get out.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.769
Barbara Miller's on three.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.439
Fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck.

07:20.524 --> 07:23.192
Now get out! Get out! I don't want to
hear your bitch-ass whiny voice again.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.568
Do you understand?
Go go go!

07:25.445 --> 07:28.614
- Hey, Babs, what are you wearin'?
- We need to have lunch, Ari.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.032
The word is out
and it's spreading.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.408
You mean that shit
about you getting lipo?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.119
Don't worry about that.
You know, from what I hear,

07:33.203 --> 07:35.412
Dr. Dessler's like a fucking
Picasso with that knife.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.248
Wake up, Ari.
I'm coming to you as a friend.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.125
People are mobilizing
against you

07:39.209 --> 07:40.501
and you need to know
what's going on.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.587
Now do you want
a Caesar fucking salad or not?

07:48.343 --> 07:50.553
Let me call you back,
Barbara.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.222
Speak, Lloyd.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.099
You're not talking?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.145
Rob Rubino's
in the conference room.

08:00.939 --> 08:01.981
Terrance fucking
fired him?!

08:02.440 --> 08:04.108
I did not say the "F" word.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.861
My... I... we...

08:06.945 --> 08:09.071
I don't have the sk...
the skill set...

08:09.156 --> 08:11.157
I can't understand you through the
whimpering, Rob. Talk to me...

08:11.241 --> 08:13.909
- why did Terrance fire you?
- Well, because he knows.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.035
- What does he know?
- He knows, Ari.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.371
- They saw your name on my call sheet.
- Fuck.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.290
And they escorted me
out of the building.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.792
And then they gave
everybody employment contracts

08:22.252 --> 08:24.336
and they had to sign them
by 5:00 p. m. This afternoon

08:24.421 --> 08:26.505
saying that they wouldn't
work for you.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.008
- What should I do?
- I don't know! I don't know,

08:29.092 --> 08:31.677
but just stop fucking crying
so I can think, okay?

08:34.054 --> 08:35.347
Call Barbara,
tell her I'll go to lunch.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.186
You know, Eddie Burns offered
me "Brothers McMullen. "

08:41.438 --> 08:44.565
True story. But I took
a TV show instead.

08:45.317 --> 08:48.152
Was that when you did
your full-frontal "Red Shoe Diary"?

08:48.236 --> 08:51.572
No, that's when I did
my three-episode arc on "90210,"

08:51.656 --> 08:54.158
sexually harassing
Tori Spelling.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.242
Nice choice.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.792
This can't be the right address.
- Look, there he is.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.633
Walsh, what is this,
your house?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.011
No, I'm house-sitting
for my girl's folks.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.556
They made a fortune off
ginseng and kombucha drinks.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.642
They won't let her see
a dime of it though.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.603
I'm just praying they drop dead before
they raise the estate tax.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.521
- How are you, Vince?
- Good, good, how you doing?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.440
So, what... what happened
to "Queens Boulevard"?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.442
- They butchered her.
- They changed it?

09:28.526 --> 09:29.860
They murdered her.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.820
You wanna see the body?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.450
Take care of yourself.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.912
Hey, you ever coming back?

09:40.872 --> 09:42.289
You kidding?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.959
I am Queens Boulevard.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.338
Insane, ain't it?

09:49.464 --> 09:51.632
Looks more like Willy Wonka's factory
than Queens.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.842
Now you see why I have to do
what I have to do.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.552
How could they ruin
a great movie like that?

09:55.804 --> 09:57.179
They're fucking animals

09:57.264 --> 09:59.056
and they need
to be put to sleep.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.226
Sign the injunction with me and they'll
know we ain't fucking around.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.603
- What do you think, E?
- I think we should call Ari.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.273
One suit, two suit,
three suit, four!

10:07.399 --> 10:09.066
Look, Billy,
I'm with you, all right?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.317
But we have to talk
to somebody first

10:10.402 --> 10:12.194
before we just
sign an injunction.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.530
Can't afford to be pissing off
another studio right now.

10:15.699 --> 10:16.657
- Pussy.
- Asshole.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.701
All right, guys, chill.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.203
Call Ari.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.458
So who's picking up
the tab on this little chow-down?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.377
Relax, Ari, my treat.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.930
Greetings, Ari.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.019
I always knew that
you liked dick, Babs.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.146
I just didn't know
you were a cocksucker.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.064
Please, join us.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.235
It's like a meeting
of the five families.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.655
Maybe I should've had a gun taped up
in the bathroom stall.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.365
Look, all the majors
are here...

10:58.450 --> 11:01.243
CAA, UTA, ICM,
Endeavor, William Morris.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.787
Who the fuck invited APA?

11:05.749 --> 11:08.125
- There it is.
- There's no spots.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.045
Just pull up in the red,
I'll go grab one.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.629
All right.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.428
Cafe latte, $4.50.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.847
Well, actually,
I'm on my 10th purchase,

11:21.931 --> 11:23.724
paid for the last nine,

11:23.808 --> 11:25.267
so you'll be paying
for that, bad boy.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.561
Actually, I won't, 'cause we don't take
those anymore.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.271
What do you mean?

11:29.647 --> 11:30.689
Too many people were
counterfeiting them,

11:30.774 --> 11:32.983
so we stopped.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.779
Well, unfortunately, the only form
of currency I have is that card,

11:36.863 --> 11:39.490
so either you accept that card or you're
gonna have to eat that drink.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.450
I'm not gonna
have to eat anything.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.869
Anybody ordering
a cafe latte?

11:43.953 --> 11:46.330
- Right here.
- Hey, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.624
That... that's my drink.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.459
Get me the manager.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.544
Yeah, well, you tell Ari
when you find him

11:52.629 --> 11:55.255
- that he needs to call me back.
I will indeed.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.550
Ari's M.I.A.
- What the fuck is he so busy with?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.260
Press conference is in three hours.
We can't be sitting

12:00.345 --> 12:02.388
- on our asses doing nothing.
- Attaboy, Vince.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.890
Well, fuck Ari!
Fuck this injunction.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.267
- Let's handle this ourselves.
What do you have in mind?

12:07.352 --> 12:08.685
I got Jamie Burke's
number from Lloyd.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.314
Don't waste your minutes. I already
called. They ain't seeing nobody.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.691
Well, if they ever want to do another
movie with Vince, they'll see us.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.779
I like your
newfound balls, suit.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.073
My rapper's signing
a big deal this month,

12:21.157 --> 12:23.742
but I still have time
to handle Vince as well.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.662
Aw, shit.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.872
Excuse me. Can you leave your
number on the windshield?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.165
Yeah.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.168
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.921
And I'm afraid I'm going
to have to say no,

12:36.005 --> 12:39.800
'cause I ain't going anywhere until
I get my free cup of coffee!

12:40.385 --> 12:42.219
Jesus Christ, Drama!
What the fuck?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.430
They discontinued
my free coffee card.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.683
Listen, pal, I'll buy you the lousy
$3 cup of coffee.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.935
You really want to get
involved in this, dickhead?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.812
Drama, Drama,
come on, come on!

12:52.355 --> 12:53.355
You don't need
any more coffee.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.149
You're wired up
enough as it is.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.276
You only got 15 minutes
to get to Ed Burns.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.864
Fuck it.
Fuck all of you!

13:01.948 --> 13:03.574
I'm gonna go
get me a pilot!

13:03.658 --> 13:06.452
But I will be back and you will give me
a free cup of coffee.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.454
Oh, fuck, the car!

13:11.416 --> 13:14.001
Hey! Hey!

13:14.085 --> 13:16.170
Hey, come back here!

13:16.254 --> 13:18.338
Turtle, call a cab!

13:18.423 --> 13:21.550
Come on, Ari, you really think
we haven't been watching you?

13:21.759 --> 13:23.010
I don't know.
Have you been watching me?

13:23.094 --> 13:25.179
Yes, we have.
And we know what you've been up to.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.014
- What have I been to?
Why don't you tell us?

13:27.223 --> 13:28.599
Why should I tell you
if you already know?

13:29.767 --> 13:31.602
All right, come on, this
is getting us nowhere here.

13:31.686 --> 13:34.563
Let me just say this...
I've known you for 20 years.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.064
- Yeah.
- I always knew

13:36.149 --> 13:39.276
that you were a smug little rat
with grand aspirations.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.487
That's why it was such
a shock to me to see you

13:41.571 --> 13:44.198
sitting in that little
boutique agency of yours

13:44.282 --> 13:45.491
for the last nine months.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.743
But I guess...
I've seen this before...

13:47.827 --> 13:49.745
it's all a ruse
in your master plan.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.747
Master plan?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.459
Look, Ari, simply put,

13:55.543 --> 13:58.253
we're here to assure you
that the eight of us

13:58.338 --> 14:00.506
who represent most
of the power in this town

14:00.590 --> 14:02.883
are lined up to say

14:02.967 --> 14:05.177
that if you go near
one of our clients

14:05.261 --> 14:06.428
or one of our agents

14:06.513 --> 14:10.015
or even one of our
highly-prized mailroom boys,

14:10.099 --> 14:12.100
we will all
come down on you

14:12.185 --> 14:14.394
with the wrath
of 10,000 suns.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.021
You know what's
interesting...

14:16.105 --> 14:17.898
about that...

14:17.982 --> 14:20.776
is that you
used the words

14:20.860 --> 14:22.986
"master plan" and "rat"

14:23.071 --> 14:26.281
when talking about me, you
Hitler-loving, anti-Semitic cunt-bag.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.700
ARl: I can only hope,

14:28.785 --> 14:31.954
that 50% of the power
at this table is as offended as I am.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.456
Ari! Is it true?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.583
Come on. Yes or no.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.840
Okay, you got me.
I'm setting up my own shop.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.717
Thank you, thank you.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.053
Ari Gold is back
and gonna be bigger than ever.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.056
But I assure you,
and I swear this

14:51.140 --> 14:53.225
on my children's names,

14:53.309 --> 14:54.893
I have no intention

14:54.978 --> 14:58.647
of going after any of your clients
or your agents.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.233
- Only his.
- Really, Ari?

15:01.526 --> 15:02.568
Really, Terrance.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.404
And with whose money do you
plan on funding all this, Ari?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.072
Yours, you cockney fuck.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.782
You signed the settlement
papers, didn't you?

15:08.950 --> 15:10.242
Yes.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.327
But I didn't sign
any checks and I won't.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.915
Ari, I'll happily spend
$50 million over the next 10 years

15:17.000 --> 15:20.168
to make sure that you
don't even get a dime today.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.717
Call everyone on that list.
Emergency Hamlet session, now!

15:26.968 --> 15:29.094
Ari, Vince and E called twice.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.722
- And they do not seem happy.
- I will call them back, Lloyd.

15:31.806 --> 15:35.225
Did you not fucking hear me? This is not
a drill. This is an emergency!

15:35.518 --> 15:37.185
Well, who's going
to man the phones?

15:37.562 --> 15:39.229
Fuck the phones, Lloyd!

15:39.314 --> 15:42.608
Unless Carmen Electra calls
for an emergency titty-fuck,

15:42.692 --> 15:43.692
don't answer!

15:44.027 --> 15:45.444
82% excellent.
That's pretty good.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.282
It's more than pretty good.
That's "Greek Wedding" good.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.700
And what these
test scores tell us

15:51.784 --> 15:54.036
is that black-and-white
is depressing.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.288
- People want color.
- Why have those eyes

15:56.372 --> 15:59.499
- if people can't see 'em, Vince?
- They might as well be brown.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.210
I didn't make this movie
to show off my eye coloring.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.005
Vince, you not only
look great in the movie,

16:05.089 --> 16:07.591
you are... great
in the movie.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.053
And with this version
we will attract a much broader audience.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.597
And isn't that what making
movies is all about?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.641
Well, actually, I mean,
it's an art film.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.809
The only way you know it's good is if
most people hate it.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.979
I'm sorry, but we
are not in the business

16:21.064 --> 16:23.857
of having people
hate our movies.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.526
Guys, I love your passion,

16:26.611 --> 16:29.863
but trust me, there's nothing
unartistic about making money.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.660
You're driving
like a snail.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.037
- I could run faster than this.
- All right, you know what?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.330
We're here.
Go get 'em.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.666
- I'm 20 minutes late.
- So run!

17:10.113 --> 17:12.531
All right!
Great news.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.242
The Gold Standard Agency
will be starting its expansion

17:15.326 --> 17:17.703
ahead of schedule.
Instead of September 1,

17:17.787 --> 17:19.454
we are going
to be starting today.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.165
Yeah!

17:23.876 --> 17:25.127
Slight problem, though.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.253
None of you will be getting
paid for about six months.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.880
What?

17:28.965 --> 17:31.216
People, come on.
The first year at Google

17:31.300 --> 17:32.551
they paid their staff
with paper clips.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.887
Now the guy that scrubbed the toilets
has got a billion five.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.848
Who's with me?
Come on, anybody?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.643
- I'm with you, Ari.
- Like you've got a fucking choice.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.312
- Anybody else? Who's with me?
- This is bullshit, Ari.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.231
You cannot be serious.
You told us...

17:46.399 --> 17:48.108
we had papers put
in front of us today.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.569
- Come on, everybody, listen.
- I have a choice.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.783
A little bit of patience,
you guys, please.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.368
Come on, you gotta...

18:01.330 --> 18:03.915
Hey, Babs, the Traitorous
Skanks Anonymous meeting's next door.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.169
Let's talk.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.304
I can't believe that you set me up
after all I've done for you...

18:17.388 --> 18:18.889
Ari, I needed
to see your cards.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.057
- You've seen 'em.
- How much do you need?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.437
- What?!
- Come on, I want to be partners.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.938
- Why?
- Because I believe in you.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.149
And because I can't work
with my ex-husband anymore.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.484
No shot, this is my deal.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.487
Ari, you have no money
and I have too much.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.988
- So what do you want?
- To fuck.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.785
Kidding.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.870
I want 60%
and my name on top.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.872
- I'd rather fuck.
- 55.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.540
- 45.
- 51.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.666
49.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.222
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.015
I present to you,

19:02.099 --> 19:04.476
Miller-Gold! Huh?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.689
We sound like
a fuckin' beer.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.235
This was the one, Turtle.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.028
I'm officially a loser.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.906
I don't know
about "officially. "

19:17.990 --> 19:19.574
What do you want me
to say, Drama?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.535
You gotta get
the temper under control.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.161
- Yeah.
- You gotta know that.

19:23.246 --> 19:26.665
I do, I do. In fact, I was thinking
about taking that anger management thing

19:26.749 --> 19:29.376
- the judge recommended last year.
- You should.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.800
- Hello?
- Johnny Drama, Eddie Burns.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.511
- Eddie?
Yeah, hey, look...

19:39.595 --> 19:40.971
- Burns?
- I've been trying to get your number

19:41.055 --> 19:43.765
for over an hour, but nobody's picking
up the phone at your agency.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.350
Really?

19:45.434 --> 19:47.561
Yeah, listen, I'm sorry
I had to bail on you today.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.771
I got an emergency
and I'm off to New York.

19:51.065 --> 19:54.025
- So you weren't at your office?
- No.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.444
Christ, I was standing
out there for like an hour.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.029
Well, look, I'm...
I'm real sorry,

19:58.114 --> 20:00.323
but I want to talk to you
about this thing I'm shooting.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.951
Hey, look, Eddie,
I know I can do this.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.911
I know you can
do it too, Drama.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.788
Truth is, I really just
wanted to see you today

20:06.873 --> 20:09.040
to make sure you
hadn't aged too badly.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.876
Aged? Me?
Come on!

20:11.419 --> 20:13.753
I carded at Barney's Beanery
Thursday night.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.672
Okay okay, Drama.
So you'll do this?

20:16.841 --> 20:19.801
Are you offering this to me?
I don't have to audition or nothing?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.888
Drama, you did something for me when
you passed on "Brothers McMullen. "

20:23.180 --> 20:24.973
- I didn't pass.
- Drama, come on.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.018
You passed to do a little arc
on "90210," it's cool.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.103
I ended up having
to put myself in the movie,

20:30.187 --> 20:31.897
changed my whole life.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.024
- Awesome.
- All right, so I'll see you on set.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.984
Okay, thanks.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.489
I just got a pilot.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.784
Yes! Yeah!

20:45.828 --> 20:47.370
Victory!

20:47.455 --> 20:49.331
And anger management?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.999
Fuck anger management.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.168
Well, after seeing
a cut of the film,

20:53.461 --> 20:55.170
we instantly
fell in love with it.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.797
From the moment
the end credits rolled,

20:58.215 --> 21:00.342
it was obvious to me...

21:00.426 --> 21:03.595
- Did you get it, Johnny?
- Yep.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.805
- It's easier than I thought.
- Congratulations, Drama.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.390
Thanks, bro.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.477
- There you are, Vincent.
- Jesus, I thought you abandoned me.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.270
Never. I came
as fast as I could.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.730
They're about
to introduce you.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.523
Right. Look, I love you.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.150
Don't worry, I think
I got this handled.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.195
- You cool with this?
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.988
What's he gotta do?
Yeah, what's he gotta do?

21:22.073 --> 21:24.199
- You'll see.
- Oh, great.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.035
A great young talent.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.038
Ah, these motherfuckin'
pieces of shit.

21:30.122 --> 21:34.042
I'm gonna fuckin' hit somebody,
there's no fuckin' doubt in my mind.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.585
Go lightly, Billy.
Life is short.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.796
Go fuck your mother, Drama.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.676
- Where you been?
- What, is there a problem?

21:42.760 --> 21:45.136
The house is packed,
our boy is looking great.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.846
You know Barbara, right?

21:46.931 --> 21:48.014
Hey.

21:49.684 --> 21:50.684
See all these cameras?

21:50.977 --> 21:53.144
ARl: Each one represents
a million dollars overseas.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.063
- Cha-ching.
I don't think so, Ari.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.148
Oh yeah?
Why not?

21:57.233 --> 21:59.609
Ladies and gentlemen...
- What? Speak.

21:59.694 --> 22:03.238
...to introduce to you now
the star of "Queens Boulevard,"

22:03.489 --> 22:06.074
Mr. Vincent Chase.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.201
Vinnie!

22:08.285 --> 22:10.245
Thank you.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.081
"Queens Boulevard"
is a masterpiece.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.290
And I'm not
just saying that

22:14.375 --> 22:16.292
because I'm in it
or to sell you.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.421
I'm saying it because
I really truly believe it.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.007
Unfortunately, you'll never see
the film I'm talking about,

22:22.675 --> 22:25.176
because these people
up here, these execs,

22:25.261 --> 22:26.678
ripped out its soul.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.056
Because like all studios
in this town

22:30.141 --> 22:32.058
they don't give a shit about art.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.270
They only care
about one thing... money.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.355
Fuck commerce!

22:37.606 --> 22:38.940
Any questions? Yes.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.068
Great start
to the new company, huh?
