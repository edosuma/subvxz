WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.308
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.010
sexually based offenses

00:10.044 --> 00:12.113
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.482
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.515 --> 00:16.317
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.350 --> 00:17.785
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.818 --> 00:19.920
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.955
These are their stories.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.460
- So, how's it been,
staying home?

00:26.494 --> 00:28.196
- Wonderful...

00:28.229 --> 00:30.631
when I'm not
bored to death.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.101
* The wheels on the bus
go round and round *

00:33.134 --> 00:35.436
* And round and round
and round and round *

00:35.469 --> 00:36.437
* And round

00:36.470 --> 00:37.971
- [laughs]
- Ugh.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.673
- If you need a break,
you should tell your husband

00:39.707 --> 00:41.675
to give Beckett dinner
and come with me to Soul Cycle.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.043
- That place?

00:43.077 --> 00:44.945
It is supposed to be exercise,
not humiliation.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.680
I have seen people
come out crying.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.881
[both laughing]

00:52.553 --> 00:53.687
Oh, let's cross.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.123
[hip-hop music]

00:55.156 --> 00:56.790
* Runnin', I'm gunnin'

00:56.824 --> 00:58.992
* I'm gonna live the same life,
son *

00:59.026 --> 01:00.228
- Uh, so if you change
your mind,

01:00.261 --> 01:01.562
I go basically
every day.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.132
- Yeah, I'll take
a rain check.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.266
[baby babbling]

01:05.299 --> 01:07.201
- All right.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.736
- Have fun
with those wheels.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.272
- Bye.

01:11.305 --> 01:14.308
[siren wailing]

01:26.154 --> 01:27.988
[dramatic music]

01:28.021 --> 01:30.991
- Do as I say
and you won't get hurt.

01:31.024 --> 01:35.563
*

01:35.596 --> 01:38.065
- [whimpers]

01:38.166 --> 01:39.167
[sirens wailing]

01:39.167 --> 01:41.802
- The victim is Sofie Nomaks.
She's 25.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.338
The perp had a knife,
told her to do what he said.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.839
She's being transported
to Mercy General now

01:45.873 --> 01:46.940
for a rape kit.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.442
- She give
a description?

01:48.476 --> 01:51.011
- White or Latino,
average height and weight.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.581
And he had a ski mask on
and the vestibule light is out.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.449
- The same M.O.
as the last two assaults.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.684
- Yep.
[knocks on the door]

01:56.717 --> 01:59.420
- Lieutenant,
this is Mr. and Mrs. Levy.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.389
She's a friend
of Ms. Nomaks.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.923
They live next-door.
- Hi.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.893
- I ran into Sofie on my way
home a few hours ago.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.761
She asked me to go
to spin class with her.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.663
- If you had, you might've been
the one who was attacked.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.931
You know there've been
two other rapes

02:10.964 --> 02:12.266
in this neighborhood
in the last month?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.834
- Since the homeless shelter
opened.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.204
They have a special section
for sex offenders.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.671
You can see them
listed online.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.872
- We're aware.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.341
- So what are you doing
about it?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.509
- Have you seen
any of these guys around here?

02:21.542 --> 02:22.776
- Yes.
- All the time.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.777
Yeah, they hang out
at the bodega

02:23.811 --> 02:25.379
and get cigarettes.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.381
- Did you see any of them there
tonight, either of you?

02:27.415 --> 02:28.782
- No, well,
thank you so much.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.687
- The victim thinks she saw
the perp run that way,

02:33.721 --> 02:35.088
toward the shelter.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.757
- We'll check for cameras
and witnesses.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.759
- Okay, let's talk
to shelter management,

02:38.792 --> 02:40.928
see if they have a swipe code
or a sign out log,

02:40.961 --> 02:44.097
then ask which
of their guests qualify.

02:48.101 --> 02:51.472
- And these are the people
you need to talk to.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.242
Any likely candidates
would be in this group.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.076
- Likely for what?
Nobody did anything.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.045
- Right, and I'm sure
you wouldn't lie to us.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.880
- Look, guys,
it's just a request.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.782
Right, we'd like you
to come down to the station.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.983
We're just gonna ask
you a few questions.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.686
- Or we can get your POs
down here,

03:05.719 --> 03:07.521
check your possessions,
your appointment calendars,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.557
maybe do
a spot drug test,

03:09.590 --> 03:12.125
just to make sure none of y'all
have violated your paroles.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.327
- Everyone here?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.363
- Not the new guy.
Where is he?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.897
- Went to get some food.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.732
- How long do you want
to keep us?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.369
- Gregory Searle?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.705
- Thought we put you away
for good.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.741
- Compassionate parole.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.343
I have health issues.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.844
- Nobody cares.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.280
Just do
what the police say.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.882
- Okay, who's hungry
for donut holes?

03:34.915 --> 03:37.885
[dramatic music]

03:37.918 --> 03:43.424
*

03:44.792 --> 03:47.761
[dramatic music]

04:31.372 --> 04:31.505
.

04:35.075 --> 04:35.709
- Where do you want
these guys?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.178
- Just out of sight.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.381
The victim's in Interview
with her father.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.616
- You want me to smack Carisi
around a little bit,

04:42.650 --> 04:44.117
make his cover look good?

04:44.151 --> 04:46.720
- Fin, we had two rapes
in Inwood this month.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.055
That's why Carisi
volunteered

04:48.088 --> 04:49.357
to live in that shelter
undercover.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.624
Would you like
to take his place?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.092
- No, copy.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.363
- Carisi does
look like hell.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.498
- Well, I think he's just
trying to fit in.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.768
Right? If he wants out,
he'll let me know himself.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.069
- See,
I don't think he would.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.405
Never mind.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.142
I'm glad you're back,
you're the boss

05:09.176 --> 05:11.812
and uh, like you said, we just
have to trust each other.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.848
- Exactly.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.120
- He grabbed me
and threw me up against the wall

05:20.153 --> 05:24.392
and then pulled off
my gold chain.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.460
[sobs]

05:26.494 --> 05:27.828
And then he said,

05:27.861 --> 05:31.599
"Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

05:31.632 --> 05:34.635
And I didn't fight him because
I was too afraid of the knife.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.405
- Sofie, you did exactly
what you needed to do.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.939
You survived.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.441
- You people know
about this homeless shelter

05:40.474 --> 05:42.009
filled with deviants?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.411
- Yes, we are aware
that there's a section

05:43.411 --> 05:45.245
for sex offenders.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.948
So--
- You allow that?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.983
- It's actually
not up to us.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.119
Some sex offender parolees
have to live

05:52.152 --> 05:53.854
1,000 feet from a school
or a playgr--

05:53.887 --> 05:57.625
- Oh, they should be
1,000 feet from Earth.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.827
- Mr. Nomaks, I can only imagine
how upset you are--

05:59.860 --> 06:02.430
- I should have never let you
move into that neighborhood.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.731
- Dad.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.032
- I really need to speak
with your daughter.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.267
- You're moving back home,
now.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.669
- I don't know.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.703
- I do.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.275
- Mr. Nomaks, right, you two can
have that conversation later,

06:15.308 --> 06:17.511
but right now I really need
to speak with your daughter,

06:17.545 --> 06:19.079
so if you'd just
give us a minute.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.286
So, Sofie,
we've brought in some men,

06:26.319 --> 06:29.022
right, and I need you
to listen to their voices

06:29.056 --> 06:31.592
to see if you
recognize anyone.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.093
- I don't think
that I'll be able to--

06:33.126 --> 06:35.128
- She'll do it.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.566
- When did this
even happen?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.568
I can tell you where I was.
I was visiting my wife.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.605
- Okay.
This is Richie Caskey.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.808
Say it.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.278
- "Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

06:52.846 --> 06:54.815
- Gregory Searle.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.550
- I got cancer,
colon cancer.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.552
I'm not running around the town
doing anything.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.853
- Let's go, come on.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.660
- "Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

07:06.694 --> 07:09.062
- It's not gonna bite you.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.967
You want me to call
your parole officer?

07:14.001 --> 07:16.504
Last chance.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.141
- "Do what I say."

07:21.174 --> 07:23.176
[phone beeps]

07:24.912 --> 07:27.180
- From the beginning.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.782
- [stuttering]
"Do w-what I say

07:28.816 --> 07:34.354
and you won't...
get...hurt."

07:34.387 --> 07:35.422
- You got Loomis to speak?

07:35.523 --> 07:36.590
- Mm.

07:36.624 --> 07:37.891
- That guy's got
a bad stutter.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.026
He barely said two words
since I moved in.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.327
- Yeah, how's it going?

07:40.360 --> 07:41.328
You okay up there?

07:41.361 --> 07:42.696
- Food sucks.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.232
Company's worse,
but--

07:45.265 --> 07:47.701
if anybody raped anybody,
they're not bragging about it.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.870
- How about tonight?
Who was out at 7:00 p.m.?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.338
- I don't know.
I was out myself.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.073
I was trailing this guy
from down the hall.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.109
He claims he was framed,
that women can't resist him.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.578
- I bet.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.079
- Turns out he was just
going out for a vape.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.281
Hey, you--you may be
getting a call

08:01.314 --> 08:03.450
from the shelter therapist,
Robin Daughtry.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.985
She wants
the background information

08:05.018 --> 08:07.788
from my arresting officer
about my heinous crime.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.022
- Well, I'll fill her in.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.457
- Anyway,
I should get back.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.325
You guys are keeping me
longer than my roomies.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.561
- Hold on,
I need your help.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.928
- What?

08:14.962 --> 08:18.999
- This.
I need another filler voice.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.168
- Do what I say
and you won't get hurt.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.037
- Do what I say
and you won't get hurt.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.807
- Do what I say
and you won't get hurt.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.378
- [stuttering] "Do w-what I say
and you won't...get...hurt."

08:31.411 --> 08:32.780
- [sighs]

08:32.813 --> 08:36.717
Um, I don't know,
maybe the first one.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.620
- The first one?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.954
- I'm sorry.
I don't know. I'm sorry.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.055
- It's okay.
It's okay.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.092
It's okay, Sofie.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.195
[knocking at the door]

08:50.831 --> 08:53.133
- Tom Zimmerman,
attorney for Richie Caskey.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.635
I understand you're
holding him here.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.369
- He's assisting us
in an investigation.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.005
- Uh-huh.
- Any hits?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.339
- This is Mr. Zimmerman.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.274
He represents
one of our visitors.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.610
- Actually, two of them.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.712
Yeah, Greg Searle
is mine as well.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.047
And if you think he's
your rape suspect, you're wrong.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.117
It's not his profile.
He's an ephebophile.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.085
Means he goes
for younger girls.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.722
- That's a wonderful argument.

09:14.755 --> 09:18.325
- Has the alleged victim
identified anyone?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.629
I'll take that as a no,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.764
so if neither of my clients
are under arrest,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.132
you should send them
back to the shelter.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.399
- In a minute.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.835
Mr. Zimmerman,
why don't you--

09:27.868 --> 09:29.870
why don't you
have a seat?

09:34.107 --> 09:36.109
- He should charter a bus,
take 'em all.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.778
- Long as it's not
a school bus.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.479
- And Sofie didn't recognize
the voice?

09:39.512 --> 09:40.480
- No.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.415
- Doesn't rule 'em out.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.784
- No, it doesn't rule 'em out,
doesn't roll 'em in.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.418
- And how long is Carisi
gonna be up there?

09:45.452 --> 09:46.687
He talks a good game,

09:46.720 --> 09:48.121
but people get killed
in those places.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.456
- Let's just give it
another day or two,

09:49.489 --> 09:50.924
see if anything pops.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.960
- He just has to keep his eyes
open and act weird.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.996
How hard is that
for Carisi?

09:59.566 --> 10:01.168
- We have a new member
of our group.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.638
You've all met...
Dominick?

10:04.672 --> 10:07.607
- Yeah, he likes
donut holes.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.678
- Okay, Dominick?

10:10.711 --> 10:12.145
- They call me Smitty.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.981
- That's fine.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.483
Participating in group therapy
is a condition of your parole.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.851
I assume you're aware?

10:17.885 --> 10:19.286
- Yes, ma'am.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.689
- We're open
with one another here,

10:21.722 --> 10:25.192
and we tell things we may
never have told anyone else.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.894
- Especially the police.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.129
- Yeah, yeah,
I understand.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.231
- The goal is not
to embarrass you.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.866
It's to help you
change your behavior

10:32.900 --> 10:35.869
even if you can't
change your desires,

10:35.903 --> 10:38.505
so that you never
go back to prison.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.140
I assume you're
onboard with that?

10:40.173 --> 10:41.675
- Yes, ma'am.

10:41.709 --> 10:45.746
- Okay.
Tell us about yourself.

10:45.779 --> 10:50.650
- Uh...
Dominick Smith, uh, 36,

10:50.684 --> 10:53.687
was born in Brooklyn,
raised in Staten Island.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.990
- And?

10:57.024 --> 11:00.260
- And, uh...

11:00.293 --> 11:03.296
I had some pictures
on my computer.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.265
- Pictures?

11:05.298 --> 11:06.734
- Of children,

11:06.767 --> 11:11.238
but I-I never laid a hand
on a child, never.

11:11.271 --> 11:15.743
- Well, you know those pictures
of kids being raped, right,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.577
so somebody had to rape
those kids

11:17.610 --> 11:19.813
just so you could look
at the picture.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.816
- Come on, man, I didn't think
about it like that, all right?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.752
- Well, maybe you should've.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.922
- Thank you, Richie.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.392
Everyone here has
had to overcome denial.

11:33.961 --> 11:37.364
- You got off on 'em,
right, the pictures?

11:37.397 --> 11:42.602
- I'm married, all right,
I love my wife, I do,

11:42.635 --> 11:46.439
but yeah, yeah,
a part of me was--

11:46.473 --> 11:49.777
it was like a secret thrill,
you know?

11:49.777 --> 11:52.045
- Your wife
sticking by you?

11:52.079 --> 11:54.614
Mine divorced me
when I got sent up.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.950
- Yeah, so far
we're not divorced, no.

11:56.984 --> 12:01.088
- Well, then you should do this
for her and um, for yourself.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.890
You know,
I'm also married.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.426
- Why are you still
living here?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.561
- His apartment is
too close to a school,

12:08.595 --> 12:10.630
and they can't afford
to move.

12:10.663 --> 12:14.401
- It's a rent-stabilized,
so my wife, uh, has a job,

12:14.434 --> 12:15.803
so she takes care
of the rent.

12:15.836 --> 12:20.240
- No wives here.
You're stuck with us.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.875
- That's tough.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.812
Did you hear that we all got
pulled into the police station

12:24.812 --> 12:26.146
just because we're here?

12:26.179 --> 12:27.314
- I heard.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.949
- Yeah, get used to it.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.650
- I know.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.086
Three rapes near the shelter
and they bring us all in?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.654
- Hmm, all of us.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.957
- I mean, I don't know
about the rest of you guys,

12:36.990 --> 12:38.591
but I'm not a rapist.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.928
All right, I just had
pictures on a computer.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.830
I mean, does anybody here
come even close

12:42.830 --> 12:44.297
to fitting that bill?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.333
- We were talking
about you.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.303
- Right, right, I'm sorry.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.875
- Tell us more
about your "secret thrill."

12:57.377 --> 12:58.846
- That's one of 'em.
I think that's him.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.247
- That's him right there.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.915
Yeah, go, go, go.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.350
Come on, move it!

13:03.383 --> 13:04.451
Come on, come on,
let me out.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.856
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- He one of them, Dad?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.557
- Yeah, cops let them all go.
Hey, my friend,

13:10.590 --> 13:11.925
didn't I just see you down
at the police station?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.527
Huh?

13:14.561 --> 13:17.097
Let me ask you something.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.098
Did you rape my daughter?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.867
- No.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.234
- Why don't you tell us which
one of your sick friends did?

13:21.268 --> 13:22.235
- I don't know.
You need to calm down.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.236
I don't know.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.438
[grunts]
- Let's go.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.145
- Next time I won't miss.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.882
- You're making
a big mistake!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.616
- Stop! Stop!
What's going on here?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.018
- None of your business.
- He's another one of 'em.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.652
- Oh, yeah?
Maybe he knows something?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.556
- Hey!

13:43.590 --> 13:45.558
You want something?

13:45.592 --> 13:47.394
- All right, all right.
- Huh?

13:48.495 --> 13:49.796
Huh?
- We'll be back.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.103
- Where'd you learn
to do that?

13:56.136 --> 13:58.138
- Nine years at Fishkill.
You okay?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.472
- Yeah, thank you.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.079
.

14:06.746 --> 14:07.447
- Carisi, you're holding
your back.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.517
Are you sure that you don't need
to go to the E.R.?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.919
- No, I'm fine,
all right?

14:11.919 --> 14:14.187
It's just a bruise.
It's not broken.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.555
I think they were just
trying to scare me.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.024
- No kidding.
Three on one.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.492
- Yeah, till Caskey showed up,
evened the odds.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.928
- Okay, so you making friends
in there?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.662
- No, not exactly.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.631
Just before that,
Caskey was busting my chops

14:24.664 --> 14:25.632
in group therapy.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.934
I had to tell everybody

14:26.934 --> 14:28.936
what a thrill I get
looking at child porn.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.839
Made me sick to my stomach.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.008
- I don't mean to keep
saying it, but he is a target,

14:35.042 --> 14:36.543
inside the shelter,
now outside the shelter.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.011
- I'm fine, all right,

14:38.045 --> 14:39.212
and I think I'm getting
somewhere, all right?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.948
Somebody up there is
committing rapes,

14:40.948 --> 14:42.349
and the odds are pretty good
it's one of my housemates.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.850
- Well, are we at least
gonna bring in Nomaks

14:43.951 --> 14:44.952
and his bat boys?
- No.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.486
No, that compromises
my cover.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.957
- Okay, I will have the precinct
call the Nomaks,

14:49.957 --> 14:52.425
tell them that they were spotted
to warn them off.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.594
- Okay, I got a lead
on one of those shelter guys.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.029
- DNA hit?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.564
- Not likely.
Our rapist wore a condom.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.599
- One of Sofie Nomaks's
neighbors came in

14:59.632 --> 15:02.069
to look at some photos.
She ID'd a pic.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.736
She said the guy was
on their street

15:03.770 --> 15:05.672
right before the rape.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.340
Richie Caskey.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.841
- Caskey?

15:08.875 --> 15:10.643
- Yeah, why?

15:10.677 --> 15:14.347
- Because Mr. Caskey just
sort of saved Carisi's ass.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.283
- Well, she says
she thinks she saw him.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.350
- Is she sure?

15:17.384 --> 15:18.518
- Not 100%.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.987
- How many percent?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.354
- Okay, Carisi, look,
this guy may have

15:21.388 --> 15:23.991
just bailed you out,
but he did do ten years

15:24.024 --> 15:26.126
for the rape of a woman
Sofie Nomaks' age.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.327
- Yeah, I get it.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.695
I get it.
I'm his fellow pervert.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.998
I'm not some woman
alone in a dark hallway,

15:31.031 --> 15:33.266
but he told me he was with his
wife when Sofie got raped.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.202
- He told me the same thing.
We've left her messages.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.569
- Okay, so go see her.

15:38.705 --> 15:42.309
And Carisi, you're "friends"
with Caskey now?

15:42.342 --> 15:44.177
Get friendlier.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.548
- Paperwork is all in order.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.883
Ijust need
a few more signatures.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.385
- Hey.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.022
Is this a bad time?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.656
- Not at all, Smitty.
Come on in.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.125
- This is the guy?
- Yeah.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.792
- Good timing.
We can always use

15:59.826 --> 16:01.594
another character witness
for our petition.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.263
- What petition?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.298
- To get Mr. Caskey's
sex offender registration

16:05.332 --> 16:07.434
reduced from Level Three
to Level Two.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.436
- It means I could, uh,
go back to my apartment

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
and live at home
with my wife.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.706
- I'm a sex offender too.
Who cares what I think?

16:13.740 --> 16:16.276
- He heroically intervened
on your behalf.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.611
It's a great story.
Ms. Daughtry's already onboard.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.712
She wrote
a beautiful letter.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.214
- I only wrote the truth.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.051
Richie works very hard
on his rehabilitation.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.119
- Yeah, and not to mention
that he nailed my ass

16:26.153 --> 16:27.820
to the wall
in our session yesterday.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.422
- Confronting your denial.

16:29.456 --> 16:35.062
He's helped a lot of men
accept responsibility...

16:35.095 --> 16:38.165
empathize with victims,
begin their own healing.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.433
- He was a model prisoner.
Now he's a model parolee.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.403
There's no way he poses
a threat to public safety.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.138
- Level Three.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.906
Did you file that petition
with the sentencing court

16:46.939 --> 16:50.077
or the Board of Examiners
of Sex Offenders?

16:50.077 --> 16:52.779
- Oh, somebody's been hitting
the prison law library.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.084
- No, I-I used to want
to be a lawyer.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.851
- Really?
Good luck with that.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.387
You gonna help us out
or not?

17:05.592 --> 17:09.196
- My husband didn't rape anybody
two nights ago

17:09.229 --> 17:10.530
because he was here.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.499
- At 7:00 p.m.?
- Uh, yes.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.766
- With you?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.703
- Yes,
after I got home from work.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.005
He's not allowed to live here.
He's allowed to visit.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.208
There's a school
three blocks away.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.742
Turns out there's a school
three blocks away

17:22.775 --> 17:24.111
from almost anywhere.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.379
- So he would live here
if he could?

17:26.413 --> 17:28.848
- Richie's my husband.
- Okay.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.018
- Do you know the circumstances
under which he went to prison?

17:32.119 --> 17:34.687
- Yes, he pulled a waitress
into a men's room and raped her.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.423
- Yeah,
at a bachelor party.

17:36.456 --> 17:40.026
He was drunk out of his mind,
and he hardly ever drinks.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.395
- That's not really
an excuse.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.131
- He didn't plan it.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.366
He didn't stalk anybody.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.268
There were strippers
at that party.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.403
The groom had
a prostitute.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.572
He had nine tequilas.
He got--

17:52.605 --> 17:54.774
- Confused
about who was who?

17:54.807 --> 17:56.876
- In his drunken condition,
yes.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.245
It's the only mistake

17:58.278 --> 17:59.412
he's ever made
in his whole life.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.848
- Okay.
Okay, Ms. Caskey,

18:01.881 --> 18:06.553
and you know that he was here
two nights ago at 7:00 p.m.?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.155
- Yes.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.056
I made a pot roast.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.692
The food in the shelter
is terrible.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.295
- Right, but the thing is,
when it's almost noon

18:15.328 --> 18:18.731
and you're not at work.
What are your hours?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.200
- Well, they vary.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.001
I'm a production manager
at a printing company.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.903
- Printing company,
lot of deadline work.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.572
Late hours, right?
- Well, sometimes.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.073
- If you're gonna be
his alibi,

18:27.174 --> 18:29.209
we have to know
your exact schedule.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.077
You understand that?

18:31.178 --> 18:32.512
- We're gonna call your boss
and find out

18:32.545 --> 18:35.548
how late you worked
that night.

18:36.883 --> 18:40.086
- Okay, okay.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.189
I got home at 8:30.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.190
- Oh.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.192
- But I know--

18:45.225 --> 18:46.759
I know Richie had been here
for a while

18:46.793 --> 18:49.896
because the pot roast
was half gone.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.407
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
Job interview.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.074
- Where are they hiring
sex offenders?

19:02.108 --> 19:03.843
I'll run right down.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.012
- Hey, uh, you don't have to do
that thing

19:06.045 --> 19:07.347
my lawyer said
the other night.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.648
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.949
- All right.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.118
- Hey, how was
your job interview?

19:12.219 --> 19:15.755
- It was good. It's ad sales
at a sports radio station.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.224
They don't care
if you're Charlie Manson.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.926
If you sell,
they'll take you.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.961
We'll see.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.796
- Where's Robin?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.698
She's usually early.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.700
- Well, she runs groups
in three other shelters.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.270
I don't know.
She's probably stuck in traffic.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.538
- She drives?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.139
- Yeah, she's got
a group in Queens,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.842
and Brooklyn,
one on the Lower East Side.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.544
A lot of traffic
out there.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.148
How you guys doing, good?

19:42.249 --> 19:45.252
- [scoffs]

19:48.255 --> 19:50.257
- Hey, when did it happen?

19:50.257 --> 19:51.491
- Half an hour ago.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.559
- Please tell me
there are witnesses?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.294
- No one saw the perp.

19:54.327 --> 19:57.330
They did hear her running
down the street, screaming.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.874
- She was stabbed.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.643
She tried to get away,
made it this far, and dropped.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.880
- Her car is over there.
It's bloody.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.884
Her clothes are inside,
her wallet, money.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.720
Here.

20:20.753 --> 20:24.857
- Robin Daughtry, Office
of Sex Offender Management,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.694
consulting psychologist.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.329
The therapist?

20:29.362 --> 20:31.931
- Carisi's group.

20:41.341 --> 20:41.474
.

20:48.281 --> 20:48.915
- It was Robin?
W-what happened?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.619
- Somebody was waiting for her
where she parked her car.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.120
He knew she was coming.
- Ugh.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.856
- He knew her usual parking spot
by the train tracks.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.326
- Got inside with her,
raped her, and stabbed her.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.160
- Stabbed her?
Why?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.029
Our rapist hasn't
killed anybody.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.997
- The M.E. found black thread
underneath her fingernails,

21:05.031 --> 21:08.401
so she could of pulled off
his mask, maybe recognized him.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.769
- It was somebody she knew?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.338
- Like one of her patients.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.872
- It could be
why he killed her.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.744
- This woman,

21:17.777 --> 21:20.079
she was the only person
who cared about these guys.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.581
I mean, she--she knew
what they were.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.916
She didn't give up on them.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.952
- No good deed.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.854
- We've had four
of these rapes in four weeks,

21:27.887 --> 21:29.856
and he murders this one.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.525
We've got a serial
probably from the shelter,

21:32.559 --> 21:33.526
and he's escalating.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.127
- It sounds like it.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.863
Carisi, Robin was late
to the session.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.230
Was the whole group
waiting for her?

21:38.264 --> 21:40.066
- Yeah, it was me,
the old guy Searle,

21:40.099 --> 21:41.368
he was there,
most everybody else.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.969
- Anybody not there?

21:43.002 --> 21:44.737
- Yeah, Loomis.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.105
Caskey, he came late too.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.375
- Caskey again?

21:48.375 --> 21:50.943
- Well, nah, he wasn't bloody.
He wasn't agitated.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.445
He wasn't even
out of breath.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.146
- But it is possible.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.383
He might've had time
to clean himself up, right,

21:56.416 --> 21:57.384
settle down.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.085
- Yeah, even so,
Lieutenant,

21:59.118 --> 22:00.753
it just seems
so out of character for him.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.456
- Out of character?
He did ten years for a rape.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.393
- I know, Rollins, but that was
a completely different M.O.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.395
Look,
Caskey had no priors.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.397
He had no weapon.
He was so drunk,

22:10.397 --> 22:11.864
he can't even
remember what happened.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.199
Now, that's no excuse--

22:13.232 --> 22:14.734
- Not for his victim.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.803
- All I'm saying is
I don't peg Richie Caskey

22:16.836 --> 22:19.138
as a cold-blooded serial
who hunts his victims

22:19.171 --> 22:21.140
and now murders somebody.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.675
- Anyone there
you like for this?

22:22.709 --> 22:26.078
- Yeah,
the weird guy, Loomis.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.717
He didn't come back
to the shelter

22:30.750 --> 22:33.252
until an hour later,
and his last conviction

22:33.285 --> 22:36.656
was for raping a schoolteacher
at knife point.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.425
- When he spoke to me,
he wouldn't talk,

22:38.458 --> 22:39.892
wouldn't look me
in the eye.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.462
- Okay,
let's start with him.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.236
- Isn't the parole officer
supposed to do this?

22:50.269 --> 22:51.671
- We can wait,
but what's the difference?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.205
- That's my box.
- Okay.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.445
- Who's this?

22:58.445 --> 22:59.512
- Amelia.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.448
That's my favorite niece.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.950
I haven't seen her
in 33 years.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.786
- Possibly because you kidnapped
one of her friends.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.621
- I think she's
out West somewhere.

23:08.655 --> 23:09.689
- Is this yours?

23:09.722 --> 23:12.258
Right here, this yours?

23:12.291 --> 23:15.294
- Uh, he uses
the second drawer down.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.935
- The top one's yours?

23:22.969 --> 23:24.804
- Top one is his, yes,
but I wouldn't touch that.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.972
He doesn't change
his sheets--

23:26.005 --> 23:28.007
- I can see that.
Thank you.

23:39.385 --> 23:42.054
What are those, keys?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.991
What are these to?

23:45.024 --> 23:47.359
- What are those keys to?

23:49.829 --> 23:51.197
- Want to check this warrant?

23:51.230 --> 23:52.699
- I'll take your word.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.567
Your partner looks honest.
- Huh.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.368
When was Loomis in here last?

23:56.402 --> 23:58.505
- Whenever he wanted.
There's direct street access.

23:58.505 --> 23:59.806
- There's no record?

23:59.839 --> 24:00.873
- Our customers
like their privacy.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.510
Here it is.

24:06.412 --> 24:09.415
- Hey, Glenda,
think we can have a little time?

24:12.685 --> 24:15.154
Hey, uh, okay,
got newspaper.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.662
Look at this,
ladies underwear.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.665
Comic books.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.233
- "Archie and Veronica"?

24:27.266 --> 24:29.268
- The triple-X version.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.839
Whoa.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.881
Hoodie.
- Yeah.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.888
- Pow!

24:54.727 --> 24:56.328
[door closing]

24:56.362 --> 24:58.565
Three hours.
He hasn't said a word.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.666
- Not even to ask
for a lawyer.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.334
- That guy's
barely breathing.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.936
It's looking pretty empty
out there.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.573
Is One-P-P sending us
reinforcements?

25:06.573 --> 25:08.007
- They sent us Dodds.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.208
You didn't seem
too thrilled with that.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.409
- Yeah, but then
they took him back.

25:10.442 --> 25:11.678
I mean, where is he,

25:11.711 --> 25:14.113
at some antiterrorist course
at Quantico?

25:14.146 --> 25:16.015
- Yes, for a week.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.084
Are you mad that he came,
or are you mad that he left?

25:18.117 --> 25:19.719
- Both.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.789
I mean--I mean, a lot of things
are changing around here.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.857
Rollins got a baby.
You got a baby.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.593
- You want a baby?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.429
You want a life.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.465
- This is my life.

25:33.499 --> 25:36.468
- Yeah, it was my life
too, Fin.

25:36.502 --> 25:38.938
My whole life.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.941
You know,
for what it's worth,

25:41.974 --> 25:44.977
having a little balance
is not so bad.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.379
- So, what,
I get a parakeet?

25:47.413 --> 25:48.915
[knocking at the door]

25:49.916 --> 25:51.150
- I got something.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.318
You know the jewelry
that we found

25:52.351 --> 25:53.820
in Loomis's storage locker.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.322
There's a locket
with an inscription on it--

25:56.355 --> 25:57.389
- Robin Daughtry?

25:57.423 --> 25:58.925
- No, but it matches
one taken

25:58.958 --> 26:01.794
from a rape victim
in Nassau County, Hempstead,

26:01.828 --> 26:03.129
one year ago.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.297
- Where was Mr. Loomis
one year ago?

26:05.331 --> 26:06.966
- In a shelter
in Hempstead,

26:06.999 --> 26:08.300
where there were also
two other rapes

26:08.334 --> 26:09.702
that happened
around the same time.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.304
- Fin, get Mr. Personality
to holding,

26:12.338 --> 26:15.708
and get me every report
from Nassau, here, everything.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.076
- I'm already on it.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.247
- Some of the guys
at the shelter

26:21.280 --> 26:22.548
may be wondering
where I keep going.

26:22.649 --> 26:23.850
- Well, if we can
figure this out,

26:23.883 --> 26:25.417
you're gonna be
done there anyway.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.754
- Okay, so we've had three rapes
in Hempstead, right,

26:27.787 --> 26:30.723
all with a mask and a knife
and condoms, so no DNA,

26:30.757 --> 26:33.525
and the first two,
the perps didn't say a word.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.261
- Loomis never speaks.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.664
- But then the third rape
in Hempstead, the perp speaks.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.932
He says, "Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

26:39.966 --> 26:41.533
- Same as the third rape
in Inwood.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.502
The first two rapes there
he also didn't speak.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.271
- So what, every third rape
he loosens up?

26:45.304 --> 26:46.706
He feels like making
conversation?

26:46.739 --> 26:48.675
- Right,
but the other thing is,

26:48.708 --> 26:51.443
the necklaces
in Loomis's storage locker,

26:51.477 --> 26:56.048
they all belong to victims
that the rapist did not talk to.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.019
There's no sign
of Sofie Nomaks' gold chain

27:00.052 --> 27:02.789
or the heart necklace
that Robin Daughtry wore.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.692
- Did Sofie Nomaks say
that her rapist stuttered?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.326
- No.

27:07.359 --> 27:11.497
And the mask in Loomis's locker
was neoprene.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.801
It doesn't match the thread
under Robin's fingernails.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.770
- Okay, so we're looking
at a copycat.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.940
- So two rapists,
and the second one's a murderer?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.208
- Yeah.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.510
Rollins, did Robin run
therapy sessions

27:24.543 --> 27:25.712
from the Hempstead shelter?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.213
- No, that wasn't
one of hers.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.715
- So who was
at the Hempstead shelter

27:28.748 --> 27:31.784
a year ago
and the Inwood shelter now,

27:31.818 --> 27:32.785
besides Loomis?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.053
- Only got one other guy

27:34.086 --> 27:38.057
who was in both places,
Richie Caskey.

27:39.558 --> 27:42.228
- Your pal.

27:52.772 --> 27:52.905
.

27:55.441 --> 27:55.908
- Hey, Rollins, hold up.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.214
You know, I thought I had
a gut for these things.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.216
- You know what,
rapists and killers,

28:04.250 --> 28:05.818
they don't carry signs
around.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.920
That's why they pay us
the big bucks.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.789
- [scoffs]
I went into that place,

28:09.822 --> 28:11.290
I hated those guys.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.959
I couldn't even stand
to be around them,

28:12.992 --> 28:16.128
but after a few days,
they just turned into people.

28:16.162 --> 28:20.599
Different kinds, like,
Searle is malignant,

28:20.632 --> 28:23.135
Loomis is damaged, but Caskey,
he's all fresh start.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.937
- Yeah, but every one
of those kinds

28:24.971 --> 28:27.673
raped women and children and
left them traumatized or dead.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.275
- I know, Rollins,
all right,

28:29.308 --> 28:30.576
and if they get
20 years in prison,

28:30.609 --> 28:32.578
I think they're
getting off easy,

28:32.611 --> 28:34.246
but when you meet them
after 20 years,

28:34.280 --> 28:37.784
you sit down,
you play dominos with them,

28:37.784 --> 28:39.318
you just wonder,
are they the same people

28:39.351 --> 28:41.087
they were when they first
got put away?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.521
- Carisi, is this you
going soft?

28:42.554 --> 28:45.792
- No, I just--I thought
if any of those guys

28:45.825 --> 28:49.929
had a chance at rehab,
it was gonna be Caskey.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.798
I mean, he was
all about accountability.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.432
He missed his wife.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.434
He was looking for a job, why?
Why would he blow all of that?

28:55.467 --> 28:59.471
- There usually isn't a why.
You know that.

28:59.505 --> 29:02.074
And we have Caskey in Inwood
during Robin's attack.

29:02.108 --> 29:05.077
You saw him there
half an hour later.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.378
- What about the Hempstead rape?

29:06.412 --> 29:08.214
- Liv is bringing in
that victim

29:08.247 --> 29:10.049
to see if she can get
a voice I.D.,

29:10.082 --> 29:12.018
but I'm gonna go check
with Caskey's parole officer

29:12.051 --> 29:13.419
to check his whereabouts
that day.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.954
- Let me come with you.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.622
- Aren't they gonna miss you
at the shelter?

29:16.655 --> 29:19.859
- Nah, I'll tell 'em
I had a job interview.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.427
I want to hear this
for myself.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.133
- Richie Caskey,
one of our success stories.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.136
Coverboy
for "Parolee Magazine."

29:31.838 --> 29:34.406
Or maybe not.
What'd he do?

29:34.440 --> 29:35.707
- Well, you don't seem
surprised

29:35.741 --> 29:36.708
that he might have done
something.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.444
- 20 years,
4,000 cons...

29:38.477 --> 29:39.578
If one of 'em
turned into a mermaid,

29:39.611 --> 29:41.080
that might surprise me.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.882
- All right, look,
he's gotta file a log

29:42.915 --> 29:44.716
with all of his appointments,
meetings, job interviews, right?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.452
- Yeah,
what are you looking for?

29:46.485 --> 29:49.889
- We're, um,
we're looking at a rape

29:49.922 --> 29:51.623
that happened
near a Hempstead shelter,

29:51.657 --> 29:52.925
one that he was living
in last year.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.394
June 14th, 6:00 p.m.

29:55.427 --> 29:58.264
Hoping you can tell us
where he was that day.

29:59.866 --> 30:05.037
- You're lucky I'm one of
the organized ones around here.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.073
[murmuring]

30:07.106 --> 30:09.241
June 14th,
4:00 p.m.,

30:09.275 --> 30:13.012
meeting
with his attorney...

30:13.045 --> 30:14.847
at the Hempstead shelter.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.284
- So what, he says
good-bye to his lawyer,

30:18.317 --> 30:20.286
and then he goes out
and he rapes somebody?

30:20.319 --> 30:23.589
- Lawyers have that effect
on some people.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.624
He was there.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.496
- Smitty.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.031
I got a job.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.767
I'm the new ad salesman
at radio station WNMZ.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.803
"Wall-to-wall sports, 24/7."

30:37.836 --> 30:40.439
- Richie, we need to talk.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.209
- Are you kidding me?

30:45.411 --> 30:47.980
Look,
whatever your name is,

30:48.014 --> 30:49.448
you know I wouldn't do
something like that.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.983
You got to know me.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.218
- Yeah, maybe I would've gotten
to know you better

30:52.251 --> 30:53.552
when you were raping
cocktail waitresses.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.821
- No, no, you know
how that happened.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.989
I can't even remember
anything.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.624
- Oh, really?
You know what, Richie,

30:58.657 --> 31:00.692
that makes a great story
for our little sessions in there

31:00.726 --> 31:03.229
and for your wife,
but I'm not buying it.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.697
- It was one waitress,
one time.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.934
- You see, your memory's
getting better already,

31:07.934 --> 31:08.935
now walk.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.138
- Hey, we good?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.076
- You remember
my lieutenant.

31:23.782 --> 31:25.851
- "Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

31:28.320 --> 31:30.756
- "Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

31:32.858 --> 31:34.860
- "Do what I say
and you won't get hurt."

31:36.695 --> 31:40.699
- [stuttering] "Do w-what I say
and you won't...get...hurt."

31:42.601 --> 31:44.136
- You think it's
one of those men who raped me?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.405
- I think
that it's possible.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.108
He may have been living
in a shelter in Hempstead,

31:49.141 --> 31:50.709
near where you were
attacked.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.845
- That place
gave me the creeps.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.281
I tried to stay away.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.449
- I understand, Mary.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.118
You recognize
any of those voices?

31:59.151 --> 32:04.090
- I don't know.
It's been almost a year.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.724
And when it was happening,
my entire body

32:05.757 --> 32:07.259
just sort of tuned out.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.261
- And that's not unusual.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.397
- Now I try
not to think about it.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.766
- That may not be
the best course.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.636
- That's what
my therapist said.

32:19.005 --> 32:23.709
- Mary,
we need to catch this guy.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.911
He's still out there,

32:26.012 --> 32:28.314
and he just attacked
somebody else.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.485
- Play it again.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.791
I'm sorry.
I just can't say.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.460
- Mary, it's okay.
You did your best.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.928
- You'd think I could make
a friend in a shelter.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.363
- Just save it, all right.
Just save it.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.032
Look, here's your lawyer.
Have fun.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.033
- I can't believe they made you
stay the whole night.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.234
I'm sorry.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.036
Detective,
your little masquerade

32:50.036 --> 32:52.038
was shameful
and illegal--

32:52.038 --> 32:53.705
- No, actually it wasn't.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.075
- How many different confidences
did you violate, I wonder?

32:56.108 --> 32:58.244
Huh?
Doctor-patient, attorney-client.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.578
- No and no.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.447
Look, you want to borrow
my bar review book?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.215
- Carisi,
take 'em out.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.816
- All right,
let's go.

33:04.850 --> 33:07.053
- Let's do this.
- Now.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.154
- Mary, what is it?

33:08.187 --> 33:11.057
- The voice.
That's the voice.

33:11.057 --> 33:12.058
- The man in the tan jacket?

33:21.167 --> 33:21.300
.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.372
- I thought you wanted
to question my client.

33:27.706 --> 33:28.807
We've been waiting here
almost three hours.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.875
I have places to be.
- Sorry, Counselor.

33:29.908 --> 33:33.279
We were just dealing
with some news.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.581
So we've located
a surveillance camera

33:35.614 --> 33:37.583
on a warehouse
about a block away

33:37.616 --> 33:40.252
from where Robin Daughtry
was murdered.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.620
- And?

33:41.653 --> 33:44.556
- And it was running
when she was attacked,

33:44.590 --> 33:47.893
when she pulled off
her attacker's mask.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.198
- From a block away?
What did it see?

33:52.231 --> 33:54.366
- Well, the image
has to be enhanced.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.604
We may have to call the FBI,
but we'll get it done.

33:58.637 --> 34:02.341
- Or you could just
save us the trouble.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.009
You can confess.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.811
- We make it easy for you,
you make it easy for him?

34:08.347 --> 34:09.548
Richie, maybe we should
go talk--

34:09.581 --> 34:10.549
- No, I'm not confessing
to anything.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.151
- Richie, listen to me.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.685
- I didn't kill Robin.
I didn't kill anybody.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.354
Why would I do that?
She was trying to help me.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.822
You know this!

34:16.855 --> 34:18.190
- Okay, well,
we've already searched

34:18.224 --> 34:19.991
your room at the shelter,
so I assume

34:20.025 --> 34:21.360
that you'll have
no objection

34:21.393 --> 34:22.994
to us searching
your apartment as well.

34:23.028 --> 34:24.730
- Please, do not bring
my wife into this.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.832
- His consent is irrelevant.
He's not a resident there.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.135
- He visits all the time.
He considers it his actual home.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.702
- Which is
legally debatable.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.504
- That's fine.
We can get a search warrant.

34:32.538 --> 34:33.872
- Easy.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.874
- Now, Mr. Caskey,
is your wife home today?

34:35.907 --> 34:39.145
- Probably,
she doesn't work on Saturdays.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.680
- Richie, maybe I should
go up there.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.182
She should have
an attorney present.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.983
- Well, suit yourself.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.519
You should know that there are
officers outside your apartment.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.488
You can go in,
but nothing comes out

34:49.521 --> 34:52.191
until we get the warrant
and we search. Understood?

34:52.224 --> 34:55.227
- [whispering] Richie,
don't say anything.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.066
- No wonder Caskey wants
to live here.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.568
It's a hell of a lot nicer
than the shelter.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.603
- Yeah, what isn't?

35:08.407 --> 35:10.409
- Hey, Lieu...

35:13.179 --> 35:14.079
- Happier days.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.249
- Oh, sure are.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.617
- Think that line
about the surveillance camera

35:18.650 --> 35:20.519
made him nervous?

35:20.552 --> 35:22.988
- Well, if it did,
he didn't show it.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.661
- Excuse me, your warrant
does not give you the right

35:29.695 --> 35:31.263
to be
unnecessarily destructive.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.998
- We're not.
It was an accident.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.833
- You can search
the whole apartment.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.869
You can search the bathroom.
You're not gonna find anything.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.373
- If you say so.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.774
- You know I'm gonna be
filing a complaint

35:42.808 --> 35:44.042
about your detective's
behavior.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.944
- And it will be given
every consideration.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.214
- See, it's exactly that kind of
attitude that is unacceptable.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.881
- Counselor,
we know the rules.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.250
We know what we're doing.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.222
- Hey, Lieutenant!
I got something!

35:56.222 --> 35:59.325
- You're moving
into lawsuit territory here!

35:59.358 --> 36:00.692
- What do you have?

36:02.894 --> 36:05.631
- Everything.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.234
- W-what is this?

36:08.267 --> 36:09.968
- This is jewelry
that the rapist took

36:10.001 --> 36:12.304
from three victims, including
Sofie Nomaks' gold chain

36:12.338 --> 36:13.572
and Robin Daughtry's
necklace.

36:13.605 --> 36:14.873
- Where is this from?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.308
- That's from your apartment.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.244
It was in the toilet tank.
Your wife tipped us off.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.078
- No.
No, that--that's not possible.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.413
- Richie, Richie, that's enough.
Don't say another word.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.548
I'll get you through this,
okay?

36:22.581 --> 36:24.149
- Get up.
You're under arrest.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.485
Get up.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.255
- Not you.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.722
You.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.090
- What?

36:32.123 --> 36:33.892
- You heard her.
Get up.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.093
- W-w-w-what's going on?

36:35.126 --> 36:36.262
- He's under arrest.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.296
- You two
out of your minds?

36:37.329 --> 36:38.597
- No, not even a little.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.266
Thomas Zimmerman,
you're under arrest

36:40.266 --> 36:42.434
for the rape and murder
of Robin Daughtry.

36:42.468 --> 36:43.935
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.671
Anything you say can and will be
used against you

36:45.704 --> 36:47.105
in a court of law.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.740
You have the right
to an attorney.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.908
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.077
- Wait,
w-w-w-what's going on?

36:52.110 --> 36:53.479
What is happening?

36:58.149 --> 37:02.521
My lawyer raped near shelters
because he knew

37:02.554 --> 37:04.856
that sex offenders
would get the blame?

37:04.890 --> 37:06.592
- Yeah.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.495
- That's--that's insane.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.863
- Yup.
It's pure sociopath.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.865
- And he stabbed Robin?

37:13.899 --> 37:15.667
You saw that
on that security camera?

37:15.701 --> 37:19.004
- Yeah, well, thing is,
there was no camera.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.406
That was a lie
to scare him

37:20.439 --> 37:22.040
into planting evidence
in your apartment.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.442
That we did get
on video.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.176
Now, your wife,
she helped us play him.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.078
She's a good woman.

37:27.112 --> 37:29.114
- Yeah, she is.

37:29.147 --> 37:33.385
She's the best,
and I ruined her life.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.086
We can't travel.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.222
You know, we can't move.

37:37.323 --> 37:40.726
We decided not to have kids
because how can you tell a child

37:40.759 --> 37:42.794
that their friends
could never come over?

37:44.463 --> 37:49.034
- Listen, Richie...

37:49.067 --> 37:50.902
I wish I could say
I never doubted you.

37:55.006 --> 37:59.244
- Yeah, well,
I'm a convicted rapist.

37:59.345 --> 38:02.348
My whole life,
everyone's gonna doubt me.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.895
- Docket ending 509612.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.564
The People versus
Thomas Zimmerman.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.366
Three counts of rape
in the first degree,

38:20.366 --> 38:22.200
one count of murder
in the first degree.

38:22.233 --> 38:25.036
- Mr. Zimmerman,
I'm more used to seeing you

38:25.070 --> 38:27.573
defending rapists.
Do we have a plea?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.508
- Not guilty.
- Duly noted.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.843
I have your attorney's
application for bail,

38:31.877 --> 38:33.379
which I'm denying.

38:33.379 --> 38:35.514
You're remanded to Rikers
pending trial.

38:35.547 --> 38:39.250
I'm sure several of your clients
will welcome you there.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.157
- Double bill.

38:46.191 --> 38:48.727
- Docket ending 360971.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.261
The People versus Gerald Loomis.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.864
Charges of four counts
of rape in the first degree.

38:52.898 --> 38:53.899
- Plea?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.603
Do we have a plea?

38:57.636 --> 39:00.506
- Not guilty.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.609
- Bastard's
not stuttering now.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.415
- Zimmerman.
They should throw away the key.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.317
I mean the guy, he rapes,
he murders, and then he tries

39:12.418 --> 39:13.452
to piggyback it
onto his clients.

39:13.485 --> 39:14.686
- Unless you're
a rich rapist,

39:14.720 --> 39:15.854
nobody's gonna
want to defend you.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.256
You're gonna get
a bottom feeder.

39:18.289 --> 39:22.160
- Still,
Caskey didn't deserve that.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.762
- Caskey is
on the registry.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.797
It makes him
an easy guy to frame.

39:25.831 --> 39:30.101
- You know, Rollins,
a guy commits a murder, right?

39:30.135 --> 39:32.638
He does his time
and then he's out and about.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.673
But a rapist, no.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.542
Nobody wants to live
next to him.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.676
No matter
what he does,

39:37.709 --> 39:39.878
he is never gonna be
trusted again.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.449
He's in purgatory.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.783
- Are you all right?
- [scoffs]

39:44.816 --> 39:47.018
- Hey.

39:47.052 --> 39:52.123
You know, why don't you
come over for dinner

39:52.157 --> 39:55.527
and hang out with Jesse?
[laughs]

39:55.561 --> 39:56.962
Yeah?

39:56.995 --> 39:58.897
I promise you the minute
she starts wailing,

39:58.930 --> 40:02.133
it will clear your head
of everything else.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.702
- Dinner, huh?

40:03.735 --> 40:06.705
- Yeah.
Come on.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.039
- Did you learn to cook?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.708
- No, I didn't
learn to cook.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.578
You're gonna cook.
We're gonna shop on the way.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.346
- Tell me that they'll be
off the streets for good.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.049
- They're gone.

40:18.083 --> 40:22.187
Thank you, Sofie.
You've been very brave.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.556
- Look, the, uh, the guy I went
after with a baseball bat,

40:24.590 --> 40:25.991
I had no idea
it was your detective.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.994
- You shouldn't be
going after anyone.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.729
You're lucky
you're not under arrest.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.765
- Thank you.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.868
- Hey.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.070
- Two bad guys go down,
that's a good day.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.540
- You're wearing
a tie in court.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.774
Very impressive.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.242
- I'm going to visit my son.

40:44.275 --> 40:48.514
He and his husband invited me
over to their place.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.248
- And you need a tie
for that?

40:50.281 --> 40:53.519
- Yeah, they got somebody coming
over there they want me to meet.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.187
- Way to get out there, Fin.
Good for you.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.223
- If you say so.
