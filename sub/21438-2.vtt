00:02.406 --> 00:04.718
What's your relationship with
Frankie Belmont?

00:06.256 --> 00:08.289
I've never met him
before in my life.

00:08.543 --> 00:10.272
Then why kill him?

00:10.320 --> 00:11.600
<i>No! Stop it!</i>

00:11.648 --> 00:14.546
I mean,
you can tell us anything.

00:15.179 --> 00:16.515
Whatever you can.

00:16.777 --> 00:19.156
I just did it.

00:19.757 --> 00:21.601
And I don't know why.

00:22.078 --> 00:23.578
I mean, I don't really know

00:23.665 --> 00:25.320
what to say to her,
to be honest.

00:25.531 --> 00:27.437
'Cause it didn't really make
any sense.

00:27.673 --> 00:30.040
She started going towards
the girlfriend.

00:30.146 --> 00:32.113
Like she
was saving her.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.820
Get down.

00:36.421 --> 00:38.640
When you were a baby inside of me,

00:38.689 --> 00:41.546
you took up all my strength.

00:42.155 --> 00:43.867
That's why she's so sick.

00:43.992 --> 00:45.812
You think he knew her?

00:46.090 --> 00:47.961
And then he let her kill him?

00:48.164 --> 00:51.179
Having in mind the rights
which were just read to you,

00:51.302 --> 00:53.179
will you be entering a plea?

01:14.397 --> 01:16.686
I'm sorry, can you repeat that, please?

01:18.721 --> 01:20.568
Guilty.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.842
Let it stand for the record that
the defendant has submitted

01:23.912 --> 01:25.459
a plea of "guilty" to the court.

01:25.733 --> 01:27.302
Counselor,
why aren't you speaking

01:27.350 --> 01:28.904
on behalf of your client today?

01:28.952 --> 01:30.852
I'm only here as a formality,
Your Honor.

01:30.997 --> 01:32.529
My client declined legal counsel

01:32.583 --> 01:34.271
and prefers to represent herself.

01:34.502 --> 01:37.603
Mrs. Tannetti, you realize
by pleading guilty

01:37.685 --> 01:39.184
you're give up your right to a trial?

01:39.416 --> 01:40.607
Yes.

01:40.821 --> 01:42.755
And your counselor has made
clear to you

01:42.845 --> 01:45.107
that second-degree murder
charges can result

01:45.161 --> 01:47.169
in life imprisonment without
parole?

01:47.246 --> 01:48.201
Yes.

01:48.279 --> 01:50.890
Mrs. Tannetti, you have
no criminal record.

01:51.063 --> 01:52.815
You've turned down a lawyer,

01:52.888 --> 01:55.857
and you're pleading guilty to
a murder you can't explain.

01:56.129 --> 01:59.763
Would you care to
clarify any of this for me?

02:00.175 --> 02:02.115
I just know that I did it,

02:02.163 --> 02:04.005
and...

02:04.529 --> 02:06.028
I just want this all to end.

02:09.723 --> 02:12.123
In consideration of the
circumstances of the crime

02:12.315 --> 02:14.357
and the defendant's unique behavior,

02:14.486 --> 02:16.966
the court orders an
examination of the defendant,

02:17.021 --> 02:19.521
pursuant to
Criminal Procedure Law 730,

02:19.569 --> 02:22.005
to determine competency
to stand trial.

02:22.358 --> 02:24.258
Pending those results,
the court will hear

02:24.306 --> 02:26.895
the defendant's plea in
a scheduled allocution.

02:28.377 --> 02:30.224
Please rise.

02:30.718 --> 02:31.990
What does that mean?

02:32.088 --> 02:34.310
The judge ordered a 730 exam.

02:34.481 --> 02:37.810
They need to evaluate you to
see if you're fit to stand trial.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.216
Cora.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.474
What are you doing?

02:42.742 --> 02:44.174
What are you doing?

02:51.185 --> 02:53.177
Did you put
Judge Baird up to this?

02:53.308 --> 02:55.755
I called, made my case.

03:11.762 --> 03:13.466
Hey, Mason.

03:13.779 --> 03:16.813
- How are you?
- Good... it's Katelyn.

03:16.872 --> 03:18.138
Oh, yeah,
no... I remember.

03:18.196 --> 03:19.787
Sorry, it's just that...

03:20.164 --> 03:21.677
it's been a while
since graduation.

03:21.725 --> 03:23.865
You...
You know anything?

03:24.333 --> 03:26.700
Like what they're saying about her,
or...

03:26.924 --> 03:28.490
or why she did it,
or...

03:28.548 --> 03:30.318
I can't talk about it.

03:30.663 --> 03:32.830
- No?
- No, sorry.

03:37.594 --> 03:39.154
Well, I'll... I'll see you around then,

03:39.202 --> 03:40.708
- I guess, huh?
- Mason, I can...

03:40.771 --> 03:42.370
there's a way out back
I know...

03:45.340 --> 03:47.807
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Yeah, okay.

03:51.323 --> 03:53.056
Thanks, I'll be good.

04:05.968 --> 04:08.631
I know you knew Frankie Belmont.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.266
No, I didn't.

04:13.178 --> 04:17.029
You're pleading guilty.
Why are you doing that?

04:18.228 --> 04:20.786
You could at least try
to help yourself.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.866
If you work with your lawyer,

04:23.150 --> 04:25.647
plead temporary insanity,

04:26.369 --> 04:28.201
you might reduce your sentence.

04:28.694 --> 04:31.563
It could take a while, but eventually,

04:31.611 --> 04:33.881
you could be with your family again.

04:34.222 --> 04:36.522
And you could get your life back.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.861
What makes you think I want my life back?

04:44.228 --> 04:46.108
- Watch her head, William...
- I see it!

04:46.302 --> 04:47.458
This is the last time.

04:47.506 --> 04:49.013
She still wakes up in the
middle of the night.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.225
She needs me to be with her.

04:50.273 --> 04:51.976
Well, she needs to learn
to sleep through it,

04:52.023 --> 04:53.951
and I need to sleep in my own bed.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.435
I can't do this much longer.

05:27.038 --> 05:29.303
We made the "Times," too.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.710
DeStefano's already worried
about foliage season.

05:32.873 --> 05:35.397
And he thinks the case'll
scare away the leaf peepers.

05:35.568 --> 05:38.139
I'm worried about that 730 exam.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.460
Judge Baird doesn't usually order those.

05:40.525 --> 05:42.756
It gives Tannetti time
to change her plea.

05:42.933 --> 05:44.893
We may still have a trial
on our hands, gentlemen.

05:45.024 --> 05:47.343
Well, it's not like we're gonna get
caught with our pants down.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.452
And we got a case.

05:48.538 --> 05:50.519
Well, yeah, but if we go to trial,

05:50.567 --> 05:54.545
we have to establish motive.
And so far...

05:55.076 --> 05:57.163
There's an explanation there somewhere.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.616
I didn't even notice her.

06:04.051 --> 06:05.881
None of us did.

06:06.198 --> 06:10.033
I remember I... I changed the music.

06:10.157 --> 06:11.951
Frankie was in a band when
he was in med school,

06:11.998 --> 06:14.545
and I had the...
the tracks on my phone

06:14.625 --> 06:15.905
to surprise him.

06:16.061 --> 06:18.127
We were just kidding around, and...

06:18.280 --> 06:22.694
next thing I know, she's
there, screaming.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.368
Did Cora say anything during any of this

06:27.433 --> 06:29.241
to you, or anybody else?

06:30.117 --> 06:31.884
I don't know. I don't remember.

06:31.932 --> 06:33.585
What about before all this?

06:33.643 --> 06:36.644
Did Frankie ever mention Cora's name,

06:36.874 --> 06:40.428
or any other women that
you might not have met?

06:40.716 --> 06:43.413
He only ever talked
about his colleagues...

06:43.461 --> 06:44.889
residents from the hospital.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.272
Well, maybe he knew her,

06:46.320 --> 06:48.520
but he didn't
tell you about it.

06:48.624 --> 06:49.773
You mean,
was he cheating on me?

06:49.820 --> 06:51.022
Is that what you're asking?

06:51.070 --> 06:53.717
Fact is, most people have secrets...

06:54.064 --> 06:57.032
even the most unlikely ones.

07:02.995 --> 07:05.395
There was a girl...

07:05.897 --> 07:08.358
that Frankie mentioned.

07:09.168 --> 07:11.780
He wouldn't talk about it with me, but...

07:12.131 --> 07:14.749
he told his friends, once,
that he had some sort

07:14.797 --> 07:17.264
of intense connection with her,

07:17.312 --> 07:20.085
but there was something wrong with her.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.858
And then some sort of
accident happened,

07:25.006 --> 07:26.842
and... it almost ruined his life.

07:28.986 --> 07:30.385
When was this?

07:30.794 --> 07:32.644
Five, six years ago.

07:32.771 --> 07:34.639
Before we met.

07:35.064 --> 07:37.116
His friends say that's when he changed.

07:47.682 --> 07:48.699
♪ Giving me love ♪

07:48.747 --> 07:50.003
Are you coming?

08:27.658 --> 08:30.729
Hey, Harry, get up here.
I'm making breakfast.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.376
Yeah, I'm coming.

08:32.629 --> 08:34.846
And then you add some chive,

08:34.955 --> 08:37.440
blueberries, sprinkles...
whatever you want.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.404
So, now you bust out the
omelet? When I'm leaving?

08:40.452 --> 08:42.318
I'm sorry, baby.
Just teaching

08:42.366 --> 08:44.643
the temporary bachelor how to survive.

08:45.312 --> 08:47.823
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, little man.

08:49.179 --> 08:51.018
So...

08:51.279 --> 08:52.580
you doing all right?

08:54.094 --> 08:55.541
What's that supposed to mean?

08:55.706 --> 08:58.330
You know, you kind of scared
the shit out of Mia last night...

08:58.378 --> 09:00.940
you're in the yard, 3:00 in the
morning, in your underwear.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.635
You doing more of that...

09:02.683 --> 09:04.666
plant-whispering shit?

09:04.924 --> 09:06.268
I was taking a break.

09:06.449 --> 09:08.518
From what, sleeping?

09:08.945 --> 09:11.438
Why is your wife looking out the
window at 3:00 in the morning?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.851
That's the question you should be
asking. - Man, just stop that shit.

09:13.898 --> 09:15.993
Next time, you wear some
pants. How about that?

09:16.072 --> 09:17.750
Stop showing your wang
to my woman.

09:21.366 --> 09:24.467
- Did you cut his hair?
- I trimmed it... barely.

09:24.589 --> 09:28.023
- What are you doing?
- Cora likes it longer. You know, it's...

09:28.071 --> 09:29.969
Well, I think it looks nice,

09:30.062 --> 09:32.125
because he has ears for once.

09:32.376 --> 09:34.443
You really coming to work?

09:34.548 --> 09:36.113
Yeah. I told you I was.

09:36.274 --> 09:38.305
I'm not gonna stick around here all day.

09:38.584 --> 09:40.251
I'm gonna go out the back, though.

09:46.497 --> 09:49.130
No, no, he's right here.

09:49.321 --> 09:52.271
He's right here, in the house.

09:52.924 --> 09:56.302
Because, I saw him on the news.

09:56.482 --> 09:59.316
I don't... I'm just creeped out

09:59.364 --> 10:02.732
and Mike's at work. Will you come over?

10:02.768 --> 10:04.521
Okay, I...

10:04.685 --> 10:07.044
Yes, yes, I know, but I didn't realize

10:07.122 --> 10:08.637
that they would send him.

10:19.776 --> 10:21.089
Sorry.

10:22.847 --> 10:25.521
Here you go.
You had... you had

10:25.606 --> 10:27.271
- the beer, right?
- I had the beer.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.880
- Beer. Food.
- Thank you.

10:28.974 --> 10:29.999
And your other stuff will be out

10:30.034 --> 10:31.000
in just a few minutes.

10:31.036 --> 10:32.468
You... you...

10:32.706 --> 10:34.672
you're new here, right?

10:35.847 --> 10:37.506
Yeah, is it that obvious?

10:37.542 --> 10:39.041
Oh, no, no, you're doing fine.

10:39.076 --> 10:41.651
I just... I hadn't seen you here before.

10:42.377 --> 10:45.619
I'm originally from upstate...
from Ellenville.

10:45.764 --> 10:47.916
- Oh, yeah, I know it.
- You do?

10:48.002 --> 10:49.143
I live in Dorchester.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.314
Yeah.

10:50.362 --> 10:51.320
I'm just... I'm picking up

10:51.356 --> 10:52.355
some inventory here, but...

10:52.390 --> 10:53.589
that's where I live.

10:56.204 --> 10:58.492
That's really the only
reason I got the job...

10:58.548 --> 11:02.998
my Aunt Margaret knows...
knows Laura, the owner,

11:03.189 --> 11:04.434
and, yeah.

11:04.759 --> 11:06.478
She hired me as a favor.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.453
Well, why'd you come to Inwood?

11:11.369 --> 11:13.657
Just wanted a change.

11:16.681 --> 11:18.741
How's the waitressing thing
working out for you?

11:18.789 --> 11:20.265
I'm... I'm terrible.

11:20.390 --> 11:21.562
- No.
- Yeah,

11:21.610 --> 11:22.601
I-I

11:22.649 --> 11:24.906
can't remember anything, I...

11:25.017 --> 11:28.018
- Spill everything.
- No.

11:28.433 --> 11:32.308
Nah, it's just... you know, you should be

11:32.589 --> 11:35.261
a hostess at a fancy spot downtown.

11:36.323 --> 11:37.563
Where they charge $30

11:37.611 --> 11:40.730
for... a salad.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.118
I'd pay 30 bucks...

11:45.688 --> 11:48.141
if you were working there.

11:52.391 --> 11:55.665
You know, at my women's
group, we talk there...

11:56.493 --> 11:59.443
about what's happening,
how we're feeling.

11:59.626 --> 12:01.544
It's such a relief to me.

12:01.785 --> 12:03.540
Could you speak directly to Harry,

12:03.588 --> 12:05.098
like we've been doing?

12:15.890 --> 12:18.304
I feel so lonely.

12:19.031 --> 12:21.999
Like you're not really interested.

12:22.499 --> 12:24.139
I feel like something could happen to me

12:24.187 --> 12:26.515
and you wouldn't even notice.

12:26.964 --> 12:29.015
I keep thinking about that
time at the hospital.

12:29.091 --> 12:31.424
Now, that's not fair. We've
already been over this.

12:31.523 --> 12:34.623
When I had my knee replacement last year,

12:34.671 --> 12:36.492
he... he left me in the hospital.

12:36.554 --> 12:38.461
He disappeared. When I woke up

12:38.496 --> 12:41.197
in the recovery room, Harry was home,

12:41.232 --> 12:43.399
spraying his dogwoods for anthrac...

12:43.435 --> 12:46.578
Anthracnose. The nurse had said...

12:46.626 --> 12:47.931
I feel invisible.

12:48.016 --> 12:50.585
The nurses had said that
it'd be at least an hour

12:50.671 --> 12:53.156
before she came out of it,
and I thought I could pop over

12:53.210 --> 12:54.890
and I could pop back, and...

12:55.015 --> 12:57.554
that was a bad call.

12:58.437 --> 13:01.695
We haven't had sex in so long.

13:01.862 --> 13:04.507
I don't even know
what he wants anymore.

13:11.262 --> 13:14.363
"Just as I am, without one plea,

13:14.624 --> 13:17.166
"but that Thy blood was shed for me,

13:17.288 --> 13:19.486
"and that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,

13:19.710 --> 13:21.992
"O Lamb of God, I come.

13:22.715 --> 13:23.874
I come."

13:23.968 --> 13:26.146
Fill us with your peace.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.680
In the name of Jesus Christ, our
Lord and Savior, we pray. Amen.

13:29.820 --> 13:32.147
Hail Mary, Full of Grace,

13:32.249 --> 13:33.849
the Lord is with thee.

13:34.023 --> 13:36.343
Blessed art though amongst women,

13:36.828 --> 13:39.976
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

13:40.225 --> 13:42.710
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

13:42.945 --> 13:44.538
pray for us sinners,

13:44.586 --> 13:46.851
now and at the hour of our death.

13:46.931 --> 13:48.564
Amen.

13:48.599 --> 13:49.765
Hail Mary, Full of Grace...

13:49.827 --> 13:52.179
Honey. Cora.

13:52.703 --> 13:54.637
I have to go back to the city,

13:54.788 --> 13:58.249
but I will be back in a few days, okay?

14:00.295 --> 14:02.662
Phoebe is gonna pull through.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.796
We just have to keep hoping for the best.

14:04.937 --> 14:06.248
You'll pray for her?

14:06.445 --> 14:09.518
I pray for her all the time...

14:09.671 --> 14:11.854
in my own way.

14:11.999 --> 14:14.357
Blessed art thou amongst women,

14:14.392 --> 14:17.593
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

14:17.629 --> 14:20.663
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

14:20.804 --> 14:24.800
Eat it before your mother finds it, okay?

14:24.921 --> 14:26.499
You deserve a treat.

14:26.704 --> 14:28.710
Thanks, Aunt Margaret.

14:29.038 --> 14:30.718
I love you.

14:31.007 --> 14:33.175
Blessed art thou amongst women,

14:33.311 --> 14:35.085
and blessed is the fruit...

14:50.762 --> 14:53.596
Give us this day our daily bread

14:53.723 --> 14:55.558
and forgive us our trespasses

14:55.711 --> 14:59.513
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.199
We can do this all day if you want.

15:02.550 --> 15:05.462
And we can come back tomorrow
and do it all over again.

15:07.026 --> 15:10.787
I know there's a story
between you and Frankie.

15:11.293 --> 15:13.355
And I'm gonna keep digging.

15:14.495 --> 15:17.074
You are not mentally ill,

15:17.152 --> 15:20.082
and sane people, they have motives

15:20.130 --> 15:22.777
for what they do, whether
they hide it or not.

15:22.980 --> 15:26.285
And me coming here is not going to stop

15:26.333 --> 15:28.066
until I hear something out of you

15:28.121 --> 15:30.098
that makes sense.

15:30.621 --> 15:32.968
There is someone out there

15:33.246 --> 15:35.246
who knows something.

15:37.285 --> 15:41.316
Maybe it's a friend or
one of your family.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.292
They've got TV cameras
following them every minute

15:44.340 --> 15:45.965
of the day because of you.

15:46.093 --> 15:47.730
And they're in pain.

15:49.605 --> 15:51.644
And you're just gonna leave them there

15:51.723 --> 15:54.348
for the rest of their
lives, with no explanation

15:54.426 --> 15:57.626
for what you did. Is that what you want?

16:04.880 --> 16:07.676
I met Frankie on July 3rd.

16:23.118 --> 16:24.818
It was five years ago.

16:27.340 --> 16:28.796
Where were you?

16:29.527 --> 16:34.308
It was at a bar, on Route 6.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.809
Carl's Taproom.

16:37.113 --> 16:41.019
But I didn't know him as Frankie...

16:41.777 --> 16:43.762
He told me his name was JD.
I didn't realize

16:43.832 --> 16:45.985
that he was lying until later.

16:48.191 --> 16:52.418
- What year was this?
- 2012.

16:52.759 --> 16:55.433
4th of July weekend.

16:56.535 --> 16:58.472
He was there at the bar
with some friends...

16:58.519 --> 17:00.065
with a couple of guys.

17:01.871 --> 17:04.636
JD had some pills and we all took 'em.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.207
And then we got in his car and
went to somebody's house.

17:08.332 --> 17:10.910
What kind of car did Frankie drive?

17:11.762 --> 17:13.558
He has a truck.

17:13.855 --> 17:16.175
A black truck with a white top.

17:16.957 --> 17:18.917
Where was this house?

17:19.332 --> 17:23.122
I'm not sure.
We just ended up there.

17:25.808 --> 17:28.480
I remember this orange carpet.

17:29.324 --> 17:31.246
And that song...

17:31.590 --> 17:33.495
Frankie just... they played it

17:33.543 --> 17:35.066
over and over and over again.

17:35.215 --> 17:38.170
It was from a band that he was in.

17:38.535 --> 17:41.598
And he just seemed
so confident.

17:42.754 --> 17:45.738
Like he was on his way somewhere.

17:46.897 --> 17:48.293
And then what?

17:54.898 --> 17:56.698
And we spent the night together.

18:00.129 --> 18:03.746
Two weeks later,
I found out I was pregnant.

18:04.762 --> 18:06.816
And I didn't know what to do.

18:06.965 --> 18:11.785
He... he had my phone number.
I didn't have his.

18:13.607 --> 18:16.285
So, I tried to track him down,
and that's when I found out

18:16.371 --> 18:19.629
that he
didn't even give me his real name.

18:21.965 --> 18:25.191
I grew up Catholic.
I couldn't get an abortion.

18:25.239 --> 18:27.191
I couldn't tell my parents.

18:30.066 --> 18:32.134
I just wanted to die.

18:39.676 --> 18:42.074
And then I woke up...

18:42.671 --> 18:45.058
in the hospital, with a fractured hip

18:45.160 --> 18:46.871
and a concussion, and...

18:47.371 --> 18:50.809
I wasn't pregnant anymore.

18:54.855 --> 18:57.457
I used to pray a lot
when I was little...

18:59.324 --> 19:03.480
I'm praying for my sister Phoebe,
praying for my mother,

19:03.667 --> 19:05.633
for myself.

19:07.451 --> 19:08.941
Hours and hours,

19:09.012 --> 19:13.488
I would... I would beg God
to help us, and for what?

19:15.277 --> 19:17.144
What kind of a God...

19:18.441 --> 19:21.640
kills your baby but lets you survive?

19:24.230 --> 19:25.964
When I heard that song at the beach,

19:26.012 --> 19:29.081
then I... then I realized who he was.

19:31.319 --> 19:33.552
Something inside me just snapped.

19:36.719 --> 19:39.052
Jesus Christ.

19:41.816 --> 19:44.196
Well, Lopez will be happy, at least.

19:44.457 --> 19:47.957
We got a story.
Kinda all makes sense now.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.467
Doesn't it?

19:52.451 --> 19:54.652
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

19:54.801 --> 19:59.027
I indulged in temptation and
risked my sister's life.

19:59.504 --> 20:01.793
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

20:01.871 --> 20:04.644
You're been praying out
here for over an hour.

20:05.246 --> 20:08.287
Phoebe saw you from the window...

20:08.605 --> 20:11.051
reminded me you were out here.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.707
I wanted to stay.

20:23.892 --> 20:25.758
I have faith that He heard you

20:25.806 --> 20:27.754
and He'll spare your sister.

20:30.332 --> 20:31.602
But...

20:31.661 --> 20:34.062
you have got to be stronger
than this.

20:34.457 --> 20:36.080
I know that it's hard,

20:36.285 --> 20:39.418
but we can't give Him
reasons to punish us.

20:39.741 --> 20:43.215
One bite of this chocolate,

20:43.922 --> 20:46.004
and He could take Phoebe's life.

20:49.074 --> 20:52.965
Okay.
Show Him you understand.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.798
I can feel you brooding
from across the room.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.027
Smiling on the inside.

21:22.134 --> 21:25.330
The usual? Medium-rare?

21:25.548 --> 21:27.720
With salad instead of fries.

21:28.056 --> 21:30.936
I... thought you were coming over

21:30.971 --> 21:33.004
on Tuesday. You could've let me know.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.205
I know. I'm sorry.

21:36.048 --> 21:39.197
The thing is, I can't
come see you anymore.

21:39.455 --> 21:43.384
- That last time was a mistake.
- You've said that before.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.951
I'm trying with Faye.

21:46.377 --> 21:48.861
I really wanna try.

21:54.228 --> 21:56.119
So why are you here now?

21:56.598 --> 22:00.822
Well... to tell you.

22:01.399 --> 22:04.072
It's an awfully long way to
come just to tell me that.

22:08.846 --> 22:10.759
Text me next time.

22:46.253 --> 22:47.353
Hey.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.837
- Come up here, come up here.
- No, no, no, no.

22:49.923 --> 22:52.072
- Yes.
- No, I want to.

22:52.609 --> 22:54.244
- Please.
- I really want to.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.400
Please.

22:55.724 --> 22:57.080
Please.

23:22.736 --> 23:24.416
What was that?

23:24.665 --> 23:26.033
I don't know.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.863
I don't know.

23:29.548 --> 23:32.257
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yeah, don't worry.

23:44.003 --> 23:45.174
And that's it.

23:45.276 --> 23:47.346
Get that tape right on the corner.

23:47.424 --> 23:48.612
Yeah. Go ahead,

23:48.674 --> 23:50.273
tear it, tear it, tear it, tear it.

23:50.401 --> 23:52.042
And...

23:56.924 --> 23:59.049
Dad, I told you he wanted LEGOs.

23:59.084 --> 24:00.617
The "Star Wars" falcon thing.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.552
Well, I thought he could

24:02.587 --> 24:04.021
use these on our hikes, you know,

24:04.089 --> 24:05.431
and if he could see the birds,

24:05.479 --> 24:07.159
he might be more interested.

24:07.268 --> 24:08.995
That right, kiddo?

24:09.511 --> 24:11.044
What's the matter, honey?

24:11.337 --> 24:12.529
- Dan.
- What?

24:12.619 --> 24:14.299
Can you help, please?

24:18.362 --> 24:20.503
Now, be honest with me.

24:20.839 --> 24:24.573
Have you ever wanted to go
up to that kid and just...

24:25.454 --> 24:28.698
- Just a little bit?
- Next time, just get the LEGOs.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.245
All right, just get the LEGOs.

24:35.047 --> 24:38.983
It's nice to be here with you.

24:40.593 --> 24:43.132
It's nice to hear you say that.

24:44.037 --> 24:45.804
It feels natural.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.476
I know how to do this.

24:51.737 --> 24:56.335
We said eight weeks, Harry.
That's what we decided.

24:56.453 --> 25:00.304
But why? Why can't we just live together?

25:00.827 --> 25:04.226
You want to still. And...

25:04.656 --> 25:06.351
I want to.

25:06.619 --> 25:11.821
Look around you... there are
so many sad stories out there.

25:17.790 --> 25:19.593
We're lucky.

25:23.445 --> 25:26.936
So, we're just trying
to back up the story

25:26.984 --> 25:29.210
before, you know, we
close the investigation.

25:30.124 --> 25:32.429
How did she know Frankie?

25:33.687 --> 25:35.611
Did she date him or something?

25:35.710 --> 25:38.179
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

25:38.717 --> 25:41.335
- But she mentioned him to you.
- No, I...

25:41.686 --> 25:44.140
I told you guys that already. No.

25:44.689 --> 25:45.921
Okay. Well,

25:46.094 --> 25:48.679
what about someone called JD?

25:49.194 --> 25:52.546
- JD?
- Yeah, it was a nickname.

25:52.929 --> 25:55.281
That's how she knew him.

25:56.030 --> 25:58.327
As JD?

25:58.965 --> 26:01.198
Did she mention him?

26:02.562 --> 26:04.453
No.

26:05.585 --> 26:07.593
What else did she say about him?

26:07.976 --> 26:09.800
Mason, I can't tell you.

26:09.890 --> 26:11.053
It's confidential.

26:11.101 --> 26:13.703
You know, I'm sitting here all day,
with this stuff circling

26:13.751 --> 26:15.547
around in my head, and
it's driving me up a wall,

26:15.594 --> 26:18.016
okay? I feel like I'm going nuts.

26:18.281 --> 26:20.723
So, don't treat me like
I'm just a witness to something.

26:20.835 --> 26:22.539
You know,
how long have you known me?

26:22.882 --> 26:25.562
Please.
Nobody's saying anything to me.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.785
Give me something to go on.
Don't... you know,

26:27.833 --> 26:29.629
you can't just leave me
in the dark about it.

26:29.677 --> 26:31.144
- Okay...
- I need... I need anything.

26:31.192 --> 26:32.913
- Please, anything to go on...
- Okay, okay.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.687
Apparently, it was a one-night stand,

26:34.735 --> 26:36.668
and he... he got her pregnant.

27:06.189 --> 27:07.252
Oh, this...

27:12.981 --> 27:15.056
Do you know how to get
the music off of this?

27:15.247 --> 27:17.423
♪ All of the girls ♪

27:17.549 --> 27:19.845
♪ All on the mattress ♪

27:35.109 --> 27:37.828
Ah! Yep. That's the face.

27:38.058 --> 27:40.117
When I saw her on the news,
I knew that

27:40.195 --> 27:42.523
I had seen her here before.

27:43.408 --> 27:45.133
So, how crazy is she?

27:46.219 --> 27:48.711
When was it that she was here?

27:49.414 --> 27:51.117
A while back.

27:51.620 --> 27:54.204
I think it was the 4th of July,

27:54.252 --> 27:57.988
'cause I remember some idiots
were setting off M-80s

27:58.023 --> 27:59.883
in the parking lot.

28:00.397 --> 28:03.875
And she was dancing with this other girl.

28:05.929 --> 28:08.331
This other girl... what
did she look like?

28:08.539 --> 28:12.289
All I remember is that
she was so sauced

28:12.406 --> 28:14.640
she couldn't stand up straight.

28:14.789 --> 28:17.969
There was a guy with them too.

28:22.337 --> 28:23.673
Was it him?

28:23.882 --> 28:25.348
No.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.016
This isn't the guy

28:27.051 --> 28:28.790
who was with Cora Tannetti that night?

28:28.946 --> 28:32.532
Don't think so.
The guy that she was with

28:32.618 --> 28:34.001
had blond hair.

28:34.368 --> 28:35.876
Okay, thanks.

28:35.993 --> 28:38.462
I'll be in touch. Thanks.

28:42.467 --> 28:44.352
It's just hard to believe.

28:45.036 --> 28:48.267
And he never mentioned
anything about a girl,

28:48.399 --> 28:49.906
- or an accident?
- No.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.548
It just doesn't sound like Frankie.

28:53.026 --> 28:55.117
He never did drugs.

28:55.892 --> 28:59.556
And abandoning a girl like that?

28:59.704 --> 29:01.218
That girl is lying.

29:01.410 --> 29:03.440
Young guys Frankie's age,

29:03.488 --> 29:05.329
it often happens that they have lives

29:05.407 --> 29:07.257
their parents aren't aware of.

29:07.532 --> 29:11.649
Did you ever hear him
go by the nickname JD?

29:12.595 --> 29:15.251
JD? No.

29:17.285 --> 29:18.856
You knew he was in a band?

29:18.904 --> 29:21.087
Sure. He mentioned it.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.892
But that was... a flash in the pan.

29:26.610 --> 29:28.945
He quit because he didn't have time.

29:29.079 --> 29:31.982
He was at Cornell working
100 hours a week.

29:32.149 --> 29:35.585
He could barely have time to come see us.

29:35.832 --> 29:37.476
What would he be doing in Dorchester,

29:37.524 --> 29:38.931
40 minutes north of here?

29:39.020 --> 29:41.126
Well, that's what we're
trying to understand.

29:41.274 --> 29:43.313
No, you don't.
You don't understand.

29:43.423 --> 29:46.997
Frankie was good.
He was too good.

29:47.126 --> 29:49.412
Even as a child,
all he ever wanted to do

29:49.460 --> 29:51.149
was help people!

29:57.576 --> 29:59.431
It's gotta be hard on both of you.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.865
When did this whole thing happen exactly?

30:02.009 --> 30:03.977
You said five years ago, but when?

30:04.277 --> 30:06.436
We think it was 4th of July weekend.

30:06.493 --> 30:08.329
In 2012?

30:09.221 --> 30:12.154
But... Frankie wasn't even here.

30:12.329 --> 30:13.489
Yeah? What do you mean?

30:13.610 --> 30:15.234
I have a colleague, Dan Strauss.

30:15.282 --> 30:18.428
He runs a
volunteer clinic in Los Angeles.

30:18.556 --> 30:21.165
Frankie went to work for him
for two months that summer.

30:21.782 --> 30:23.390
I have the registration paperwork

30:23.438 --> 30:25.024
in my office somewhere.

30:25.243 --> 30:27.208
He wasn't even on this coast!

30:33.712 --> 30:35.711
- Yeah?
- <i>Thought you should know this.</i>

30:35.747 --> 30:37.228
- I was just gonna call you.
- <i>Been trying to track down</i>

30:37.275 --> 30:39.681
<i>Cora Tannetti's hospital records
after that car accident.</i>

30:39.868 --> 30:42.915
You know how she says she
went to Saint Amelia's?

30:43.222 --> 30:45.251
They have no record of her.

30:46.024 --> 30:49.142
<i>Checked all over the state. Nothing.</i>

30:49.394 --> 30:51.267
Okay.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.415
<i>And you know how she said in her
interview that her parents were both dead?</i>

30:54.462 --> 30:55.598
<i>Guess what?</i>

30:55.813 --> 30:58.204
They are alive and well,

30:58.403 --> 31:01.071
a half hour away in Ellenville.

31:31.322 --> 31:34.588
As long as you're a loner,
they'll push you around.

31:35.596 --> 31:37.267
You should sit with us.

31:37.486 --> 31:39.035
No, thanks.

31:39.197 --> 31:40.986
Suit yourself.

31:46.249 --> 31:48.316
We have to move you, honey.

31:49.924 --> 31:52.517
Otherwise, they get worse.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.939
Okay...

31:57.124 --> 31:58.369
Okay, okay.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.156
She'll be okay.

32:22.875 --> 32:25.844
We'll keep praying, and
God will make her better.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.227
Come here.

32:32.695 --> 32:34.438
Look at her.

32:35.534 --> 32:37.433
Do you know why she's not better?

32:37.774 --> 32:40.828
Because you're not doing your part.

32:43.188 --> 32:47.289
Tell your sister what you did.
Tell her why she's so sick.

32:49.203 --> 32:53.125
Because I'm a sinner and I took
the chocolate from Aunt Margaret.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.516
Look her in the eye and apologize.

32:59.290 --> 33:00.789
Cora!

33:03.030 --> 33:04.844
Sorry.

33:26.924 --> 33:28.315
Cora.

33:30.690 --> 33:33.635
Why did you lie to me about
your parents being dead?

33:34.455 --> 33:37.885
And the pregnancy. That
isn't true, is it?

33:38.658 --> 33:40.432
How about the hospital?

33:41.135 --> 33:43.193
I didn't go to the hospital.

33:43.346 --> 33:44.892
The driver of the car who hit me

33:44.940 --> 33:47.097
took me to his home for treatment.

33:49.643 --> 33:51.924
Do you even realize that
I'm trying to help you?

33:51.994 --> 33:54.447
- Are you?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

33:54.830 --> 33:57.073
Nobody else gives a damn, but...

33:57.244 --> 33:58.291
I'm here.

33:58.346 --> 34:02.413
But you're a detective and you're
not supposed to be helping me, so...

34:02.854 --> 34:04.096
Why?

34:06.697 --> 34:09.275
The truth is my job... know the truth.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.596
- You're so full of shit.
- Good,

34:11.713 --> 34:13.744
we have something in common, don't we?

34:15.025 --> 34:16.525
How do you know Frankie?

34:16.687 --> 34:18.219
I told you.

34:18.283 --> 34:20.130
- We met on July 3rd...
- No, don't.

34:20.166 --> 34:22.744
Don't screw around with me.
Why did you kill him?

34:24.197 --> 34:25.384
I don't know.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.971
Yes, you do know.

34:28.088 --> 34:31.284
And I know that you know.
You don't get to do

34:31.331 --> 34:32.864
what you did and not know.

34:32.913 --> 34:35.174
What happened on the beach?

34:36.955 --> 34:40.377
You were sitting there with your husband,

34:40.588 --> 34:43.096
and you were slicing up
a pear for your son,

34:43.143 --> 34:46.603
and Frankie and his friends
were 15 yards away,

34:46.719 --> 34:50.705
and somebody was playing music.

34:51.509 --> 34:54.619
And you heard that music, didn't you?

35:00.155 --> 35:02.881
It reminded you of something, didn't it?

35:06.879 --> 35:09.561
- Turn it off.
- No, we are going through this.

35:09.624 --> 35:11.506
We are going through this step by step.

35:11.592 --> 35:12.999
I'm not doing this.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.030
- Turn it off.
- Why?

35:18.413 --> 35:20.819
He did something to you, didn't he?

35:20.897 --> 35:22.122
What did he do?

35:22.170 --> 35:23.395
What did he do to you?

35:23.458 --> 35:24.682
Screw you.

to the cops about it,

- No, Lane is not okay.

And I'm not okay.

36:54.285 --> 36:56.871
Our world is turned
upside-down right now.

36:57.426 --> 37:00.113
And you won't even talk to me.

37:14.090 --> 37:16.628
You still hang out with Mitch?

37:16.832 --> 37:18.430
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Yeah.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.700
Yeah, I don't know.

37:20.903 --> 37:24.160
Hey, you remember this guy
from back then... JD?

37:24.340 --> 37:25.926
He drove that black truck,

37:26.207 --> 37:28.140
hung out with Jason and those dudes?

37:28.379 --> 37:29.842
Yeah.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.684
Yeah, JD's still around.

37:31.879 --> 37:33.812
Yeah, up in Kingston, mostly.

37:33.981 --> 37:36.015
I know a couple guys that
run with him sometimes.

37:36.332 --> 37:37.543
Okay.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.067
You think you can...
just hook me up with him?

37:43.075 --> 37:44.623
Why do you wanna mess with him?

37:44.973 --> 37:46.856
I just wanna meet him. You know.

37:46.950 --> 37:48.621
Work stuff, maybe.

37:49.574 --> 37:51.410
You think you can introduce me?

38:04.198 --> 38:05.697
Hey.

38:07.473 --> 38:11.258
I can't say exactly how it helps.

38:11.637 --> 38:15.231
I... I feel calmer.

38:15.825 --> 38:18.262
My mind is quieter, I think.

38:18.770 --> 38:22.535
It's like a shift.

38:24.931 --> 38:27.033
And you sit on those cushions?

38:27.371 --> 38:30.166
Oh, no. I just sit in the chair.

38:33.542 --> 38:35.697
Well, it sounds interesting.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.197
You gotta do something
about the reflection.

38:48.510 --> 38:51.557
Hey, that's a good...

38:56.400 --> 38:58.291
Come back.

38:59.167 --> 39:00.939
You're gonna be okay.

39:02.985 --> 39:04.916
Come back.

39:07.142 --> 39:08.955
Come back.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.882
You came back.

39:52.861 --> 39:54.845
- Harry.
- Dan, thanks.

39:54.931 --> 39:56.205
I appreciate this.

39:56.345 --> 39:57.955
Look, I wanna show you something.

39:58.009 --> 40:00.564
I hope you got something good, 'cause I
only got about 4 hours of sleep left.

40:00.611 --> 40:02.200
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

40:02.486 --> 40:05.173
Cora, right?
That song I played

40:05.235 --> 40:06.422
triggers her somehow.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.688
When she hears it,
something happens.

40:09.970 --> 40:11.303
- Look at this.
- Whoa, Harry.

40:11.423 --> 40:14.306
- Okay, where she hit me?
- Yeah.

40:14.342 --> 40:15.571
The pattern.

40:15.634 --> 40:18.423
One here, one here, and one here.

40:20.777 --> 40:23.969
Look at the stab wounds
on Frankie Belmont.

40:28.612 --> 40:32.648
Same exact places.
She stabbed Frankie seven times,

40:32.793 --> 40:35.798
right? Look at this.

40:36.457 --> 40:38.603
Look how many times she hits me.

40:39.087 --> 40:40.673
One...

40:40.988 --> 40:43.337
two... three...

40:43.462 --> 40:46.470
four... five...

40:46.821 --> 40:48.720
six...

40:49.172 --> 40:50.643
seven.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.915
Sweet Jesus.

40:56.196 --> 40:59.767
She's repeating exactly
what she did on that beach.

41:00.423 --> 41:02.798
She doesn't even know it.
