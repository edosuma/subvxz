00:52.995 --> 00:54.861
Naydia, what is it?

00:57.633 --> 00:58.565
They're...

00:58.567 --> 00:59.866
They're coming.

01:02.504 --> 01:04.738
No matter what happens
you must stay close to me,

01:04.739 --> 01:06.106
do you understand?

01:06.108 --> 01:07.941
Look at me and tell me
you understand!

01:07.943 --> 01:09.810
Yes, I understand.

01:10.479 --> 01:11.611
It's time.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.947
We must leave now or it
will be too late.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.086
Brother.

01:19.822 --> 01:21.655
I will protect you.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.607
Father. Benjamin. Come quickly!

04:14.029 --> 04:15.829
O gosh.

04:17.699 --> 04:20.733
- Father. Father.
- Put pressure on it.

04:20.736 --> 04:23.637
She is losing a
lot of blood and quickly!

04:23.639 --> 04:26.773
It's okay dear, you will
be okay.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.976
It's going to be ok.

04:31.246 --> 04:33.213
She's gone.

05:51.326 --> 05:52.959
How is she?

05:53.996 --> 05:55.228
Faring well.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.031
She's exhausted, but
that's to be expected.

06:00.302 --> 06:02.636
Have you her
name, or anything?

06:03.305 --> 06:04.738
Not yet.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.140
I'll insist she stay with
us when she wakes,

06:07.142 --> 06:08.675
don't you agree?

06:08.677 --> 06:11.177
I can't bear the thought
of turning her away.

06:13.281 --> 06:14.714
I think it best.

06:14.716 --> 06:17.350
Lord knows what she
went through before she

06:17.352 --> 06:18.785
arrived here.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.100
Get as much rest as you can.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.936
I'll be right here if you
need anything at all.

06:40.876 --> 06:42.342
It's going to be alright.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.013
What is your name?

06:49.051 --> 06:50.283
Nakomay Lee.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.918
That's beautiful.

06:53.722 --> 06:54.954
I'm Ethel.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.025
My father is Thomas and
my brother is Benjamin.

07:00.228 --> 07:02.195
We were all quite
concerned for you.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.267
Where is Naydia?

07:08.437 --> 07:09.869
Where is she?

07:09.871 --> 07:12.072
It's okay. I'm sorry Nakomay.

07:13.075 --> 07:14.908
I'm so very sorry.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.382
I'm so sorry Nakomay.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.340
Your hands are so cold.

08:54.342 --> 08:57.043
Sit while I get you some tea.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.581
Mr. Thomas.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.953
I can't bother you all to
stay here much longer.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.324
You have all done so
much for me already, I...

11:26.027 --> 11:27.694
...what will others think
if they know you are

11:27.696 --> 11:29.262
allowing me shelter?

11:29.264 --> 11:32.999
The opinion of others is of
no concern to me, or any of

11:33.001 --> 11:34.600
us for that matter.

11:36.104 --> 11:38.071
You're welcome in
this house for as long

11:38.073 --> 11:40.006
as you'd like to stay.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.345
Is there anyone you
would like me to notify...

11:46.982 --> 11:48.715
...that you are safe?

11:52.187 --> 11:53.653
There is no one.

11:53.655 --> 11:56.155
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

11:58.460 --> 11:59.525
You know...

11:59.527 --> 12:02.295
...I don't think you
found us by chance.

12:02.297 --> 12:05.231
I think you were meant to find
us.

12:33.061 --> 12:35.561
Things around these parts
haven't gotten a lot better.

12:35.563 --> 12:37.446
Of what do you speak?

12:37.448 --> 12:39.332
There has been a group of
men running amuck...

12:39.334 --> 12:42.101
...causing all sorts of havoc
here on the frontier.

12:42.103 --> 12:45.104
Some of the worst have been
burning down entire towns...

12:45.106 --> 12:47.140
...and kidnapping the women.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.641
It's not good, son.

12:51.079 --> 12:51.744
You don't think that-

12:51.746 --> 12:52.512
-Nakomay?

12:52.514 --> 12:54.180
I've thought about her.

12:54.182 --> 12:56.282
The heartache she has endured.

12:56.284 --> 12:59.719
Sounds far too similar to
what these men are doing.

13:01.356 --> 13:03.322
If that is the case, it would
explain so much.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.824
It does indeed.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.661
I'm just thankful she
found us when she did.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.399
As am I.

14:22.637 --> 14:24.237
Nakomay!

14:30.512 --> 14:32.311
I couldn't help but notice
you from a distance.

14:32.313 --> 14:33.646
Are you alright?

14:40.455 --> 14:41.787
My mother...

14:43.691 --> 14:45.591
...she was quite beautiful.

14:48.663 --> 14:50.863
Her own mother
died in childbirth...

14:50.865 --> 14:54.600
...leaving her solely to
be raised by her father.

14:57.505 --> 15:00.473
He became a drunk and
could be wildly abusive.

15:04.312 --> 15:07.446
One day when she realized
she could take it no longer...

15:07.448 --> 15:09.582
...she fled from home.

15:11.419 --> 15:13.786
She was quite young to
be out on her own.

15:17.892 --> 15:20.259
She soon encountered
a young man.

15:21.863 --> 15:23.496
My father.

15:26.901 --> 15:28.734
He was a white man.

15:30.205 --> 15:31.604
Noble character.

15:31.606 --> 15:33.472
Highly educated.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.744
They fell in love and soon
married.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.917
My siblings and I were
raised to learn English.

15:46.387 --> 15:47.954
Reading and writing.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.925
Three years ago...

15:52.927 --> 15:56.862
...our home and land
were burned in the night.

15:59.634 --> 16:01.834
Everything we had was taken.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.540
Mother and father did all they
could to

16:07.542 --> 16:09.475
protect us from the terror.

16:12.981 --> 16:15.648
It was the last time
we ever saw them.

16:18.486 --> 16:20.386
From that moment on...

16:20.388 --> 16:23.256
...my sister, brother, and
I were left to fend

16:23.258 --> 16:24.624
for ourselves.

16:27.562 --> 16:29.462
We had nowhere to go...

16:29.464 --> 16:33.299
...because we were not
accepted by many white people...

16:33.301 --> 16:36.035
...nor people from our tribe.

16:39.807 --> 16:41.407
I'm sorry.

16:41.809 --> 16:43.309
Don't be sorry.

16:43.311 --> 16:45.811
Never be sorry for
bearing your heart.

16:45.813 --> 16:48.614
It takes great courage.

16:50.451 --> 16:53.519
Thank you for trusting
enough to confide in me.

16:56.824 --> 16:58.557
You're so brave.

17:37.332 --> 17:40.333
I didn't expect
to see you this time of night.

17:41.536 --> 17:43.469
Would you care to join me?

17:44.605 --> 17:45.771
I...

17:47.842 --> 17:49.508
...I suppose.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.031
Pardon me.

18:12.033 --> 18:14.066
What do you think you're doing?

18:14.936 --> 18:16.469
I'm sorry.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.671
I was going to say a blessing.

18:24.912 --> 18:26.528
Dear Lord...

18:26.530 --> 18:28.147
...thank you for this bounty
before us.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.449
May we use it for the
nourishment of our bodies

18:30.451 --> 18:32.585
and our bodies to thy service.

18:32.587 --> 18:33.953
Amen.

18:39.527 --> 18:41.761
I didn't see you
much around today.

18:42.430 --> 18:43.662
I just...

18:43.664 --> 18:47.400
...I thought a little time
of solitude would be best.

18:47.402 --> 18:48.934
I understand.

18:48.936 --> 18:53.739
I hope this meal isn't too
harshly imposing on your plans.

18:53.741 --> 18:54.540
No.

18:54.542 --> 18:55.908
Not at all.

18:59.647 --> 19:01.180
Thank you.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.016
So tell me.

19:04.886 --> 19:06.819
What is it that you love?

19:06.821 --> 19:08.587
I'm sorry?

19:09.056 --> 19:10.456
I...

19:10.458 --> 19:12.491
...just trying to get to
know you better...

19:12.493 --> 19:13.893
...that's all.

19:17.465 --> 19:19.131
You like to write I see.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.766
Poems mostly.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.035
I do love poetry.

19:24.639 --> 19:27.039
I would like to read a bit of
your work sometime.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.008
Oh, I...

19:29.010 --> 19:31.944
...I don't know. It's just...

19:31.946 --> 19:35.047
...I've never let anyone read
my writing before...

19:35.049 --> 19:36.715
...that's all.

19:38.453 --> 19:40.686
Maybe one day you'll
change your mind.

19:43.691 --> 19:45.858
Thank you again for the meal.

19:45.860 --> 19:47.460
It was lovely.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.963
Thank you for joining me.

19:50.965 --> 19:53.799
It was a pleasure to have your
company.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.569
Benjamin, my dear, what
a pleasant surprise

20:30.571 --> 20:32.071
it is to see you.

20:32.073 --> 20:33.806
How do you do, Mrs. Harvey?

20:33.808 --> 20:35.541
Do come in.

20:36.978 --> 20:40.045
Frank will be delighted
to have your company.

20:42.517 --> 20:43.983
How is he?

21:16.017 --> 21:17.249
Mr. Harvey

21:17.251 --> 21:19.251
How are you doing sir?

21:19.253 --> 21:21.220
Uh, Benjamin.

21:23.624 --> 21:25.024
So nice to have a...

21:25.026 --> 21:27.159
...friendly face stop in.

21:28.062 --> 21:29.595
You know.

21:29.597 --> 21:32.765
You have really been
on my mind lately.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.233
Me sir?

21:34.235 --> 21:36.735
You know, our boy...

21:37.204 --> 21:38.737
...William.

21:39.307 --> 21:40.906
He was to...

21:40.908 --> 21:43.275
...follow in my footsteps.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.045
With William being gone...

21:46.047 --> 21:48.180
...I've had a lot of thought...

21:48.182 --> 21:50.082
...who is going to continue on.

21:50.084 --> 21:52.651
Ben, I really want you...

21:52.653 --> 21:54.920
...to be the one to take
over the church.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.822
And I know...

21:56.824 --> 21:59.224
...that is a big thing
to ask of you.

22:00.061 --> 22:01.994
Could you go home...

22:01.996 --> 22:05.297
...and pray about it, will ya?

22:11.939 --> 22:13.305
I will sir.

22:13.975 --> 22:15.374
Thank you.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.913
Take care of yourself.

22:20.915 --> 22:24.283
Thank you Benjamin, God
be with you.

22:51.812 --> 22:53.979
So much bad has happened.

22:56.684 --> 22:58.984
I seem not to understand it.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.421
Why her?

23:03.791 --> 23:05.958
Naydia was so young.

23:05.960 --> 23:09.028
Why didn't they take me instead?

23:17.838 --> 23:19.438
How did it happen?

23:24.779 --> 23:27.446
We had been on the
run for sometime.

23:29.183 --> 23:31.216
I thought we were safe.

23:32.219 --> 23:34.386
My brother thought the same.

23:36.691 --> 23:38.857
Somehow they found us.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.062
They took our furs, our
belongings.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.931
Everything.

23:48.302 --> 23:51.003
I did everything I could.

23:52.273 --> 23:54.039
I tried.

23:56.877 --> 23:59.011
Of course you did.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.182
It wasn't your fault.

24:03.184 --> 24:05.718
I just don't understand.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.960
I can't let you do this
to yourself any longer.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.199
You have to realize
it wasn't your fault.

24:21.469 --> 24:23.469
It wasn't your fault.

24:25.773 --> 24:28.140
Help me, please.

24:32.446 --> 24:35.514
I'll be right here, every
step of the way.

24:37.785 --> 24:40.119
We'll get through
this together.

24:44.992 --> 24:46.959
I promise.

25:18.092 --> 25:20.292
Good try Ethel.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.200
Let me give it a try.

25:48.522 --> 25:50.856
Father are you alright?

25:51.458 --> 25:53.125
Our brigade...

25:53.127 --> 25:56.595
...marched out of
Williamsburg, October 2nd.

25:58.365 --> 26:00.098
1864.

26:03.037 --> 26:05.170
Many a strong man quivered...

26:05.172 --> 26:09.408
...overcome with numb emotion,
for we knew what lie ahead.

26:09.410 --> 26:12.277
As we proceeded into battle...

26:12.279 --> 26:14.880
...that dreary day.

26:16.016 --> 26:18.584
I never imagined my life
would be spared.

26:22.189 --> 26:25.524
The battlefield, sweeping
green pastures...

26:25.526 --> 26:29.228
...rolling hillside was
advantageous for

26:29.230 --> 26:31.263
cannon operations.

26:31.265 --> 26:34.099
A job for which we were tasked.

26:34.101 --> 26:37.636
The pride of the human
spirit weighed heavy...

26:37.638 --> 26:43.308
...like sulfurous smoke,
clouding the skies, long before

26:44.378 --> 26:46.612
a cannon was ever fired.

26:48.282 --> 26:50.015
In the end days

26:50.017 --> 26:53.418
when the heavens are rolled up
like a scroll, I doubt if it

26:53.420 --> 26:56.355
will present a more awe
inspiring spectacle

26:57.892 --> 27:01.293
than that of the historic
field that fatal morn.

27:03.264 --> 27:05.597
When I was at my lowest...

27:07.368 --> 27:10.903
...thinking all hope was
forever in the past.

27:13.073 --> 27:14.573
That's when I heard-

27:14.575 --> 27:16.575
-Heard what?

27:16.577 --> 27:19.945
The voice of what I dare
say was an angel.

28:44.598 --> 28:48.000
He leadeth me.

28:51.538 --> 28:55.240
O blessed thought.

28:59.079 --> 29:03.148
O words with heavenly comfort
fraught.

29:11.225 --> 29:14.292
Whate'er I do.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.698
Where'er I be.

29:25.439 --> 29:28.507
Still 'tis God's hand...

29:31.779 --> 29:35.047
...that leadeth me.

29:41.688 --> 29:44.756
His faithful follower...

29:47.694 --> 29:50.762
...I would be.

29:57.771 --> 30:01.540
For by His hand...

30:06.080 --> 30:09.648
...He leadeth me.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.691
Oh father.

30:52.693 --> 30:56.161
It was as though God
was reminding me

30:56.163 --> 30:58.430
that I was not alone.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.194
Elegant.

31:29.196 --> 31:32.864
Like the breeze flowing gently
on an early spring morning.

31:34.301 --> 31:35.534
Captivating.

31:35.536 --> 31:39.271
Like the rolling waves
that crash upon a dry...

31:39.273 --> 31:40.772
...welcoming shore.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.741
Distant.

31:42.743 --> 31:47.212
Like a far off island full of
vast unexplored mystery.

31:48.849 --> 31:50.282
Beautiful.

31:50.284 --> 31:51.816
Intriguing.

31:52.386 --> 31:53.618
Alluring.

31:55.322 --> 31:56.555
You.

33:14.434 --> 33:17.836
I too know the severe heartache
of losing someone you love.

33:22.643 --> 33:25.710
You hear that time will
soften the pain, but...

33:26.780 --> 33:29.414
...I scoff at that.

33:34.921 --> 33:38.356
When my father was away at war
our home was overtaken.

33:39.426 --> 33:41.059
We all stood there...

33:41.061 --> 33:43.028
...helplessly watching the
needless

33:43.030 --> 33:44.963
destruction of our belongings.

33:48.502 --> 33:50.969
My mother was holding
me in her arm...

33:52.606 --> 33:54.839
...and James in the other.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.678
Benjamin was standing
by her side.

34:03.784 --> 34:06.551
There was a noise of some
sort and James...

34:06.553 --> 34:10.621
...somehow managed to break
free from my mother's grip.

34:12.359 --> 34:14.759
There were soldiers all around.

34:17.797 --> 34:19.397
A soldier.

34:19.399 --> 34:23.435
Unsympathetically just shot my
mother and walked away.

34:25.706 --> 34:28.106
Leaving three small
children alone.

34:30.077 --> 34:32.010
Scared and motherless.

34:32.913 --> 34:34.679
Oh Ethel.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.882
I had no idea.

34:40.754 --> 34:42.821
I'm so very sorry.

34:51.063 --> 34:52.496
Though...

34:52.498 --> 34:55.800
...she was only with you
for a short time...

34:57.537 --> 35:00.705
...her legacy continues to
live on through her children.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.576
That is quite apparent.

35:13.086 --> 35:15.520
Every since that tragedy...

35:15.522 --> 35:19.057
...Benjamin and I rarely left
one another's side.

35:19.059 --> 35:23.595
James on the other hand, he
has never been the same.

35:23.597 --> 35:26.664
I truly believe he still
blames himself

35:26.666 --> 35:28.533
for the accident.

35:28.535 --> 35:30.568
But he was so young.

35:31.438 --> 35:33.772
He didn't do that intentionally.

35:37.511 --> 35:40.578
I do pray that one day
he will realize that too.

35:49.589 --> 35:52.457
How did you come to
live out west?

35:54.861 --> 35:57.529
My father came home
from the war following

35:57.531 --> 35:59.464
mother's passing and...

35:59.466 --> 36:02.967
...we only spent one night in
our desolate destroyed home.

36:02.969 --> 36:07.505
The following day we packed
up and came out here.

36:11.011 --> 36:13.144
I think the pain of being
there was too great

36:13.146 --> 36:15.013
for father to bear.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.619
I can't say I wouldn't
have done the same.

36:24.691 --> 36:26.991
After arriving here my
father planted this

36:26.993 --> 36:29.060
tree in her memory.

36:30.797 --> 36:34.532
I think it was his way of
keeping her near him always.

37:21.081 --> 37:23.047
Are you alright?

37:25.719 --> 37:28.219
How many you think
you've put in the ground

37:28.221 --> 37:30.755
since we started all this?

37:34.961 --> 37:36.194
Well.

37:38.999 --> 37:41.766
I stopped keeping
count a long time ago.

37:46.172 --> 37:48.740
Why didn't you let me kill
those dirty savages

37:48.742 --> 37:50.975
when I had the chance...

37:52.279 --> 37:54.546
...down at that hill?

37:55.749 --> 37:58.750
Are you, are you gettin' soft
on me?

38:26.680 --> 38:29.781
You, uh, you think I'm gettin'
soft?

38:45.765 --> 38:47.932
You're just not the same, boss.

38:51.671 --> 38:53.871
We had been tracking
those three filthy savages

38:53.873 --> 38:55.740
for some time now.

38:57.110 --> 38:58.977
Watching their every move.

38:58.979 --> 39:00.979
Noting their every pattern.

39:02.849 --> 39:04.983
Then we do what we always do.

39:06.286 --> 39:08.653
We take the strength from 'em.

39:08.655 --> 39:11.723
And there is nothing like
seeing the pain in their faces

39:11.725 --> 39:14.092
when you take their lifeblood.

39:15.662 --> 39:17.996
When I saw them two
cowered down...

39:28.975 --> 39:32.744
...I knew takin' the young
one, would hurt the most.

39:38.051 --> 39:40.118
That's 'cause sufferin'...

39:41.421 --> 39:44.989
...can do a lot more hurt
to a person than death.

39:49.663 --> 39:51.396
I want her back!

39:59.439 --> 40:02.306
Men will pay a high
price for her.

40:06.413 --> 40:08.046
Yeah.

40:09.049 --> 40:10.982
We'll get her back.

40:35.875 --> 40:38.810
You seem rather
quiet, is everything alright?

40:38.812 --> 40:41.012
Yes, I'm fine.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.718
I've just been thinking
about our conversation earlier.

40:48.254 --> 40:49.487
Oh?

40:51.191 --> 40:52.423
It's just...

40:52.425 --> 40:56.761
...despite your loss and
heartache of losing someone

40:56.763 --> 40:58.162
so very dear...

40:58.164 --> 41:01.866
...how are you able to
continue on in such a way?

41:03.369 --> 41:06.270
There are days where I feel as
though hope hangs around

41:06.272 --> 41:08.139
like a dear old friend.

41:10.243 --> 41:12.310
Those days are few
and far between.

41:14.481 --> 41:17.482
More often than not I feel as
though I can't grasp

41:17.484 --> 41:20.752
the hope and peace that I
have seen you all attain.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.422
It's as if it comes naturally.

41:27.827 --> 41:29.894
Our hope has never
been grounded within

41:29.896 --> 41:31.395
ourselves my dear.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.498
It hasn't?

41:35.101 --> 41:36.501
Well then how?

41:40.273 --> 41:42.974
Hope and peace of the nature
of which you speak do not

41:42.976 --> 41:44.542
come from within.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.980
They in their truest forms are
not enough to sustain you

41:48.982 --> 41:50.948
amid the struggles of life.

41:53.787 --> 41:55.953
But when found in the Lord.

41:55.955 --> 41:58.890
They become your guiding light.

42:01.828 --> 42:04.896
And despite the devastations
that we may face.

42:07.433 --> 42:09.500
His unwavering love will...

42:09.502 --> 42:12.904
...walk alongside us the
rest of our days.

42:20.814 --> 42:23.047
You have to reach a point
where you can just

42:23.049 --> 42:25.116
lose the grip of it all.

42:25.118 --> 42:27.051
A point where...

42:27.053 --> 42:31.022
...letting go feels more
freeing than holding tightly.

42:32.926 --> 42:34.992
Where can I find this?

42:37.330 --> 42:40.498
All you need to do is reach
out and boldly ask for it.

42:44.337 --> 42:45.937
That's it?

42:47.373 --> 42:48.973
That's it.

43:34.554 --> 43:35.987
God.

43:37.190 --> 43:39.957
I've heard your voice
in the silence.

43:41.461 --> 43:43.895
I've felt you in the wind.

43:45.598 --> 43:48.299
Never did I know it was you...

43:49.469 --> 43:52.169
...someone in whom I never
believed.

43:56.309 --> 43:59.143
You beckon me with your calm
stillness.

44:04.117 --> 44:05.349
God.

44:07.253 --> 44:09.086
Hear my cries.

44:14.427 --> 44:16.193
Stay near me.

44:23.536 --> 44:25.303
I need you.

44:26.539 --> 44:27.972
Now.

44:29.475 --> 44:31.375
And forevermore.

45:36.743 --> 45:38.676
Dearest Nakomay,

45:38.678 --> 45:42.480
I hope this letter comes to
you as no disturbance.

45:42.482 --> 45:45.149
My silence I shall keep no
more as thoughts of you

45:45.151 --> 45:47.118
continually cross my mind.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.554
The moments in which we
have spent together...

45:50.556 --> 45:53.758
...I have taken not a single
one for granted.

45:55.728 --> 45:58.429
I hope our days together
go without number.

46:01.100 --> 46:03.167
It is with deepest sincerity...

46:03.169 --> 46:06.303
...that I ask your
accompaniment in the morning.

46:07.273 --> 46:08.672
If you so desire...

46:08.674 --> 46:11.642
...meet me near the river
after sunrise.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.246
Benjamin.

46:59.592 --> 47:01.692
I see you received my letter.

47:01.694 --> 47:03.294
Indeed I did.

47:03.296 --> 47:06.263
It was quite the unexpected
surprise to say the least.

47:08.334 --> 47:10.201
Well, are you ready?

47:10.203 --> 47:11.802
Where are we going?

47:11.804 --> 47:13.337
You'll see.

48:39.425 --> 48:42.226
It's times like this that make
me feel as though I don't

48:42.228 --> 48:43.861
have a care in the world.

48:45.965 --> 48:47.398
Today...

48:47.400 --> 48:49.400
...you don't.

49:02.415 --> 49:05.349
It's an honor to have this
time with you today.

49:05.351 --> 49:08.552
You're a remarkable woman,
Nakomay.

49:14.393 --> 49:17.461
Promise me this won't be our
last adventure together.

49:17.463 --> 49:20.231
It's far from our last.

50:12.585 --> 50:14.385
Nakomay! Nakomay!

50:14.387 --> 50:16.687
It's ok, It's just James.

50:16.689 --> 50:19.056
I promise, everything is fine.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.495
I'm sorry.

50:24.497 --> 50:26.563
Hey, no need to be sorry.

50:32.838 --> 50:34.972
It's James, as in your brother?

50:34.974 --> 50:37.741
Yes, how did you know?

50:38.811 --> 50:40.678
Ethel told me.

50:42.048 --> 50:44.315
Does he come around often?

50:45.418 --> 50:47.351
No, not usually.

50:49.488 --> 50:51.555
Well, I'll leave you be.

51:07.006 --> 51:09.006
No warm welcome I see.

51:09.008 --> 51:11.375
It's been a while.

51:13.479 --> 51:15.546
It's good to see you, James.

51:19.418 --> 51:22.453
Pardon me for asking, but have
you been drinking?

51:24.557 --> 51:25.789
Some.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.359
Sorry I'm not able to
be an outstanding

51:28.361 --> 51:29.860
gentleman like yourself.

51:29.862 --> 51:31.628
James, I'm not...

51:34.700 --> 51:37.101
Every family has their mess up.

51:38.537 --> 51:41.505
And you've not dealt
with life the way I have.

51:43.476 --> 51:44.742
Alright.

52:01.961 --> 52:04.995
James! What a
wonderful surprise.

52:09.802 --> 52:12.669
It's so good seeing you
around here, son.

52:15.741 --> 52:17.975
Ethel is just finishing
preparing a meal

52:17.977 --> 52:20.511
we would love to
have you join us.

52:27.052 --> 52:29.019
Is everything alright?

52:31.490 --> 52:33.157
I'm fair enough.

52:33.159 --> 52:35.826
Just been busy that's all.

52:37.663 --> 52:39.530
Let me help you.

52:41.500 --> 52:42.900
Help me?

52:44.837 --> 52:47.604
And what is it that you
think I need help with?

52:50.676 --> 52:52.810
I already told you that I'm
fine.

52:58.617 --> 53:00.551
It's not you James.

53:01.187 --> 53:03.120
You're not yourself.

53:04.690 --> 53:07.624
It pains me deeply to
see you like this.

53:11.096 --> 53:12.529
Ethel.

53:13.732 --> 53:15.132
Just stop.

53:15.134 --> 53:18.202
Please, just tell me what
you need from me!

53:25.578 --> 53:26.810
Stop.

53:35.187 --> 53:37.855
He just needs some time dear.

53:57.943 --> 54:00.010
What are you doing out here?

54:01.847 --> 54:03.914
I just need some alone time.

54:03.916 --> 54:07.718
Our brother has been away
for months and you now feel

54:07.720 --> 54:09.653
it's time to be alone.

54:09.655 --> 54:12.256
It seems as though you're
hiding.

54:12.758 --> 54:13.991
Hiding?

54:14.660 --> 54:16.527
Hiding from what?

54:16.529 --> 54:19.897
You can't do this every
time James shows up.

54:26.205 --> 54:27.704
Benjamin.

54:30.009 --> 54:32.776
He needs us, you and me!

54:32.778 --> 54:36.780
We can't let him do this
to himself any longer.

54:38.284 --> 54:40.217
I know he needs us.

54:41.787 --> 54:43.020
I do.

54:48.961 --> 54:51.728
I want to see him
change, I really do.

54:53.065 --> 54:55.299
But how do you bring
change to someone...

54:55.301 --> 54:58.602
...who doesn't show a
single desire for it.

54:59.638 --> 55:01.204
You love him.

55:01.907 --> 55:03.307
That's how.

55:03.309 --> 55:06.243
No matter what I've done
you've always been

55:06.245 --> 55:07.911
there for me.

55:07.913 --> 55:10.581
And although I've strayed
from time to time.

55:10.583 --> 55:12.783
You've always been a friend
and comfort when I

55:12.785 --> 55:14.284
needed you the most.

55:15.621 --> 55:17.688
Be that for him.

55:22.695 --> 55:24.161
You're right.

55:26.098 --> 55:28.165
He will listen to you.

55:29.902 --> 55:32.803
Have you seen the way
that he looks up to you?

55:32.805 --> 55:34.371
It's never been of...

55:34.373 --> 55:37.874
...jealousy or anger. It's
always been of admiration.

55:37.876 --> 55:42.346
And now it's seemingly hidden
amid the turmoil in his mind,

55:42.348 --> 55:44.281
but it's still there.

55:46.619 --> 55:49.186
He just needs his brother
now more than ever.

55:53.225 --> 55:56.293
You have a way of getting to
him when no one else can.

55:58.998 --> 56:01.398
You just have to be patient with
him.

56:03.769 --> 56:06.103
I truly believe he'll come
around.

56:10.376 --> 56:11.808
Ok.

56:39.204 --> 56:40.971
James!

56:42.141 --> 56:44.274
There's someone I would
like you to meet.

56:44.276 --> 56:47.711
This is Nakomay. Nakomay, this
is my brother James.

56:47.713 --> 56:49.746
How do you do?

56:53.952 --> 56:55.919
I'll let you be.

56:55.921 --> 56:58.355
If you both would please excuse
me.

56:59.224 --> 57:01.725
It was nice to meet you.

57:03.896 --> 57:06.163
Is that the best
you can do?

57:06.165 --> 57:07.431
Who is she?

57:07.433 --> 57:09.299
What is she doing here?

57:11.370 --> 57:13.303
A woman like that has no
business being in a

57:13.305 --> 57:15.005
place like this.

57:15.007 --> 57:17.107
She lives here.

57:17.109 --> 57:18.975
She what?

57:18.977 --> 57:22.045
Have I been away for such
a time that I have

57:22.047 --> 57:23.480
missed so much?

57:25.017 --> 57:27.084
It's beginning to seem that way.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.155
Don't tell me you take an
interest in that woman.

57:32.157 --> 57:34.991
It's apparent in the way
you look at her.

57:34.993 --> 57:37.327
But she's far different
than the both of us.

57:37.329 --> 57:39.830
Don't you act like you
don't see that.

57:41.233 --> 57:43.834
I don't see her any
different than I see you...

57:43.836 --> 57:46.770
...or anyone else for
that matter.

57:46.772 --> 57:48.405
Listen to yourself.

57:48.407 --> 57:50.407
Do you truly believe you
can have a future with

57:50.409 --> 57:52.175
a woman like that?

57:52.177 --> 57:54.444
- I believe that...
- Oh, Benjamin.

57:55.347 --> 57:57.447
Think about what you're doing.

57:57.449 --> 57:59.783
What are people going to
think about you?

58:03.756 --> 58:04.988
Besides...

58:04.990 --> 58:08.892
...father told me about your
plans to become a minister.

58:08.894 --> 58:11.862
How you do something of that
sort when you run around

58:11.864 --> 58:13.530
with the likes of her, huh?

58:13.532 --> 58:16.833
Have you no notion of what it
takes to hold a

58:16.835 --> 58:18.401
position like that?

58:19.505 --> 58:21.538
I know exactly what it takes.

58:22.474 --> 58:24.775
I firmly believe, brother...

58:26.111 --> 58:28.512
...you've lost sight of it all.

58:36.155 --> 58:38.188
Pardon my foolishness.

58:39.358 --> 58:41.391
I think at times I just...

58:41.393 --> 58:44.394
...allow my prejudice to
get the best of me...

58:45.898 --> 58:48.965
...for that, I guess I do owe
you an apology.

58:52.938 --> 58:54.971
You ever think about...

58:54.973 --> 58:58.208
...what it might be like if
mother was still here?

59:00.846 --> 59:02.579
Of course I do.

59:02.581 --> 59:06.516
- I think about it quite often.
- As do I.

59:12.191 --> 59:13.590
You don't...

59:15.060 --> 59:16.993
I don't what?

59:18.430 --> 59:21.364
You don't still blame yourself,
do you?

59:23.402 --> 59:25.001
Ah, Ben.

59:26.238 --> 59:29.172
That's easy for you to say, you
did nothing wrong.

59:29.174 --> 59:31.408
If I had not been such a
reckless fool.

59:31.410 --> 59:33.910
You and I wouldn't be
having this conversation

59:33.912 --> 59:35.846
and you know that to be true.

59:35.848 --> 59:38.381
You were merely just a child.

59:38.383 --> 59:40.884
Yeah, one who caused his
mother her life.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.061
Benjamin...

59:53.198 --> 59:54.865
...I'm trapped.

59:57.336 --> 01:00:00.337
I find it difficult to see
above this cloud of disparity

01:00:00.339 --> 01:00:02.405
that just looms over me.

01:00:04.376 --> 01:00:08.144
This war inside my mind that I
fight from sunrise to sunset...

01:00:10.082 --> 01:00:13.316
...it's a bitter battle and if
I dwell there for too long I...

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.186
...I feel as though I'm losing
it...

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:18.455
...truly.

01:00:35.107 --> 01:00:38.508
The pain you've dealt with is
echoed throughout our family.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.546
Although we fathom...

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.584
...life with mother here.

01:00:50.289 --> 01:00:53.323
We've never once cast
the blame on you.

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:09.105
Why don't you stay here
with us a while?

01:01:09.107 --> 01:01:11.474
Would you consider it?

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.244
I would.

01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:17.247
If it be permissible with
father and Ethel.

01:01:20.485 --> 01:01:23.320
I can speak for all of us in
agreement.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.656
We need you here.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.350
I can see it.

01:03:07.259 --> 01:03:09.492
What is it that you
see?

01:03:16.368 --> 01:03:17.600
Love.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.303
For the first time...

01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:22.605
...I see love.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.742
It's breathtaking.

01:03:29.714 --> 01:03:31.614
Marry me.

01:03:38.457 --> 01:03:40.490
Yes.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.593
Yes, I will.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.860
Isn't funny how life has a
way of becoming

01:05:57.862 --> 01:06:00.263
- something you never dreamt.
- Certainly.

01:06:00.265 --> 01:06:02.865
I wouldn't for a moment
change my present

01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:04.968
for what lie in my imagination.

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:06.669
Is that so?

01:06:07.939 --> 01:06:09.973
Had my mother been here...

01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:13.443
...oh, I have spent many
nights wishing that.

01:06:13.445 --> 01:06:17.614
I would be quite the different
woman then the one I am now.

01:06:17.616 --> 01:06:20.883
It brought me far closer to
my father and brothers...

01:06:20.885 --> 01:06:23.853
...and our love developed
in a unique way...

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:26.889
...that I'll treasure forever.

01:06:28.927 --> 01:06:32.328
The way this family loves
is unlike any I've seen before.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:36.733
You've changed me my
dear. For the better.

01:06:38.503 --> 01:06:40.903
For your presence I am thankful.

01:06:40.905 --> 01:06:44.340
Knowing that you will be
forever a part of this family

01:06:44.342 --> 01:06:46.376
brings me all the more joy.

01:06:50.582 --> 01:06:52.682
I have something I
want to show you.

01:06:53.585 --> 01:06:55.285
Follow me.

01:07:06.364 --> 01:07:07.930
What is this?

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.900
It's my mother's wedding dress.

01:07:11.603 --> 01:07:13.536
It's breathtaking.

01:07:13.538 --> 01:07:16.072
What a sweet tangible
memory to possess.

01:07:18.343 --> 01:07:20.910
I've been saving this for
my wedding day.

01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:24.681
But now that you and
Benjamin are to be wed

01:07:24.683 --> 01:07:27.450
it would be my greatest honor
to see you wear it.

01:07:27.686 --> 01:07:28.918
Me?

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.554
No, I couldn't do that.

01:07:35.694 --> 01:07:37.026
Look.

01:07:40.365 --> 01:07:43.399
You will be the most beautiful
bride in all the world.

01:07:43.401 --> 01:07:46.703
I can't put into words what
this means to me.

01:07:49.074 --> 01:07:51.407
I don't know how to thank you.

01:07:52.844 --> 01:07:55.545
You wearing this dress is
thanks enough.

01:07:55.547 --> 01:07:59.549
Oh how I will forever remember
this precious moment.

01:08:02.887 --> 01:08:06.489
The whole concept of marriage
is something quite new to me.

01:08:11.396 --> 01:08:13.496
Would you do me a great honor?

01:08:13.498 --> 01:08:16.933
It would mean everything
for you to stand by me

01:08:16.935 --> 01:08:18.868
on my wedding day.

01:08:19.938 --> 01:08:21.970
Most certainly my dear.

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.674
Thank you.

01:08:32.082 --> 01:08:34.450
When we were
children, James, Benjamin, and I

01:08:34.452 --> 01:08:37.019
would spend a great deal of
time out in this field.

01:08:38.055 --> 01:08:40.122
See those trees over there?

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:43.593
We would see who could
best get to the top first.

01:08:43.595 --> 01:08:47.697
James had quite a competitive
spirit about him.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:53.169
Oh to be young and carefree
again.

01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:58.573
Did you hear something?

01:08:58.977 --> 01:09:00.475
I did.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.912
I don't see anything though.

01:09:03.915 --> 01:09:06.883
We've been gone for
quite a while.

01:09:06.885 --> 01:09:09.752
Maybe we should start to head
back.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.161
No. Come on, hurry.

01:09:22.466 --> 01:09:25.167
No! Please! Take me not her!

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.669
Please!

01:09:53.163 --> 01:09:54.931
Ethel!

01:09:57.035 --> 01:09:59.035
You can't leave me.

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.693
NO! Ethel!

01:11:19.717 --> 01:11:21.751
My sweet Ethel.

01:12:05.797 --> 01:12:08.030
What's wrong? No. No. You're
okay.

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.299
You're going to be okay.

01:12:10.301 --> 01:12:12.068
Look at me!

01:13:16.968 --> 01:13:19.235
Well, what do we have here?

01:13:19.237 --> 01:13:22.972
It's our unintentional
find tonight boys.

01:13:22.974 --> 01:13:25.675
She's a lovely one I'll say.

01:13:27.879 --> 01:13:31.113
Wait a minute. I think
I remember this one.

01:13:34.152 --> 01:13:35.751
You!

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:53.869
Father!

01:13:56.441 --> 01:13:57.940
Help!

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:00.209
Help.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.250
Nakomay! Where is she?

01:15:16.487 --> 01:15:18.254
I don't know.

01:15:20.324 --> 01:15:22.958
James! Where is Nakomay!

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.994
They took her.

01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:33.869
You tell me what you need from
me.

01:15:37.341 --> 01:15:40.376
We have to find her! No
matter what it takes!

01:15:42.146 --> 01:15:44.046
We have to find her!

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.118
What is it that you want from
me?

01:16:24.388 --> 01:16:26.322
The war is over!

01:16:28.092 --> 01:16:30.159
You've taken our land.

01:16:30.161 --> 01:16:32.995
You've taken our loved ones.

01:16:34.232 --> 01:16:36.098
You stood by...

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.301
...and allowed my siblings to
be mercilessly killed.

01:16:41.172 --> 01:16:43.105
And for what?

01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:49.044
What more could you possibly
want?

01:16:54.018 --> 01:16:56.418
What did you just say to
me?

01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.022
Around these parts, miss, I
always get what I want.

01:17:00.024 --> 01:17:03.926
And who do you think you are
to talk to me in such a manner?

01:17:03.928 --> 01:17:06.495
I'll tell you who I am.

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:11.934
I am a child of God.

01:17:12.904 --> 01:17:15.204
I will not fall into despair.

01:17:15.206 --> 01:17:18.107
No matter what is taken from me.

01:17:18.109 --> 01:17:21.176
My spirit cannot be broken.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:25.214
For even in this bondage
I have freedom.

01:17:27.485 --> 01:17:30.085
My freedom, it lies within.

01:17:30.955 --> 01:17:33.289
And it cannot be taken from me.

01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:36.392
Despite any attempts that you
make.

01:18:51.469 --> 01:18:53.268
Ah!

01:19:03.047 --> 01:19:04.580
No!

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:12.287
James! Look at me!

01:19:13.324 --> 01:19:14.623
James!

01:19:17.061 --> 01:19:18.694
No!

01:20:30.167 --> 01:20:31.834
You came for me.

01:20:31.836 --> 01:20:36.438
There's nothing in this world
that will keep me from you.

01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:42.344
I'll always fight for you.

01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:52.754
James!

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.351
Near the cross...

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:12.821
...I watch and wait.

01:24:15.793 --> 01:24:18.860
Hoping, trusting, ever.

01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:25.734
Till I reach...

01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:30.339
...that golden strand,

01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:35.010
just beyond the river.

01:24:40.584 --> 01:24:42.651
In the cross.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:46.855
In the cross.

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.728
Be my glory ever.

01:24:57.401 --> 01:25:00.469
Till my ransomed soul shall
find.

01:25:05.542 --> 01:25:08.610
Rest beyond the river.

01:25:14.418 --> 01:25:17.486
Till my ransomed soul shall
find.

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:25.060
Rest beyond the river.

01:25:41.111 --> 01:25:42.878
At times...

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.048
...when we're staring into
the face of fear.

01:25:50.954 --> 01:25:54.589
Feeling as though we can't
even catch another breath.

01:25:57.795 --> 01:26:00.862
This is when we needn't
lose our hope.

01:26:02.499 --> 01:26:05.734
For it is hope that is our
greatest weapon.

01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:10.205
With it, the darkest hours...

01:26:11.442 --> 01:26:13.675
...can be split wide open.

01:26:15.446 --> 01:26:16.945
Despite...

01:26:17.748 --> 01:26:19.815
...grave heartache.

01:26:21.084 --> 01:26:23.518
Hope found in Christ.

01:26:25.489 --> 01:26:28.223
This is the sole thing
that you have...

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:31.493
...in which you can hold.

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:35.964
As many of you may know...

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:38.900
...my health...

01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:42.204
...has been in a steady decline.

01:26:44.007 --> 01:26:46.074
But with joyful heart.

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:48.877
Our beloved, Benjamin Nelson.

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.080
Will graciously...

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:56.117
...be taking my place as
your new minister.

01:26:57.654 --> 01:27:00.722
And for that, we are
abundantly grateful.

01:29:17.694 --> 01:29:21.196
Do you think God could ever
forgive a wretch like me?

01:29:23.634 --> 01:29:25.367
I've just...

01:29:26.003 --> 01:29:28.003
...done so much.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.014
I do believe He will.

01:29:39.683 --> 01:29:41.182
Completely.

01:29:47.124 --> 01:29:50.058
I've done so many
detestable things.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:53.261
The record of wrongs
I've caused is...

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:56.031
...too numerous to count.

01:30:00.003 --> 01:30:02.937
I've just never
understood, why, God...

01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:05.206
...if there is a God...

01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:08.943
...would ever allow someone
to take a shape like mine.

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:15.850
Many people think that it's
God that has walked away

01:30:15.852 --> 01:30:18.353
from us when all along it's we
who have walked away

01:30:18.355 --> 01:30:20.088
from Him.

01:30:25.195 --> 01:30:28.129
We've been sought after
with an extravagant...

01:30:29.166 --> 01:30:31.366
...long pursuing love.

01:30:31.368 --> 01:30:35.336
This love requires
nothing from us but...

01:30:35.338 --> 01:30:38.473
...in one in which
everything is given.

01:30:39.743 --> 01:30:42.143
It's one in which we ought
mirror.

01:30:44.347 --> 01:30:47.182
One we freely give to
our fellow man.

01:30:51.221 --> 01:30:54.022
But despite the devastation
that I've caused

01:30:54.024 --> 01:30:56.891
you and your family, how can
you in good conscience

01:30:56.893 --> 01:30:59.060
treat me with such kindness?

01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:03.231
My actions, they're
unforgivable.

01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:09.037
Nursing a bitter wound
will do nothing but

01:31:09.039 --> 01:31:10.872
destroy from within.

01:31:10.874 --> 01:31:13.274
I have forgiven you.

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:16.778
To be truthful, we all have.

01:33:09.192 --> 01:33:12.193
Life can deal you
a hand which you never

01:33:12.195 --> 01:33:14.128
expected to receive.

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.466
Our struggles are only
momentary.

01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:22.170
At times, they feel as though
they stretch into a span

01:33:22.172 --> 01:33:23.638
of eternity.

01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:28.009
It felt as though the one
thing for which

01:33:28.011 --> 01:33:30.578
I deeply longed was too
distant to reach.

01:33:32.582 --> 01:33:34.382
As it turns out...

01:33:34.384 --> 01:33:37.886
...I found that one thing I
fought so long...

01:33:37.888 --> 01:33:41.956
...so hard for, was fighting
twice as hard for me.

01:33:44.227 --> 01:33:45.560
Love.

01:33:48.198 --> 01:33:51.165
Love runs wildly, eradicating
darkness with each

01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:52.967
passing step.

01:33:54.204 --> 01:33:56.237
Hope is at its side.

01:33:56.239 --> 01:33:59.140
Continually casting out fear.

01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:03.511
It is patient. Oh so very
patient.

01:34:06.216 --> 01:34:08.116
It's a kind friend.

01:34:08.118 --> 01:34:11.486
One which you feel has
always belonged.

01:34:12.622 --> 01:34:15.690
It dances amid the most
violent storms.

01:34:17.327 --> 01:34:20.128
No record of wrong does it keep.

01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:24.365
When you choose to release
the grasp of fear and defeat...

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:27.635
...it in turn sets your soul
afire.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:35.476
When your steepest
mountains refuse to move,

01:34:35.478 --> 01:34:39.013
believe that a stream will
lead you out.

01:34:39.015 --> 01:34:42.717
Trust that your tears are
not wept in vain,

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:46.220
but help aid in your healing.

01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:49.057
Trust in your past.

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:52.593
For it shapes how you
walk in your tomorrows.

01:34:54.597 --> 01:34:57.598
Lean continually into the one
who holds the earth

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.401
delicately in the palm of His
hand.

01:35:02.038 --> 01:35:04.005
Without fail.

01:35:04.007 --> 01:35:07.275
He will always be the
greatest source of strength

01:35:07.277 --> 01:35:09.043
and comfort.

01:35:09.045 --> 01:35:11.546
In time of lack and plenty.

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:16.484
Lastly...

01:35:16.486 --> 01:35:19.454
Forget not to trust in love.

01:35:19.456 --> 01:35:23.458
For it is by this that all
things are made whole.

01:35:27.163 --> 01:35:29.197
Made beautiful.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:00.480
