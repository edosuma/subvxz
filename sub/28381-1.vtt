00:54.429 --> 00:56.139

<i>Okay, baby.</i>

<i>Paint.</i>

01:11.613 --> 01:13.239

<i>A unicorn.</i>
<i>A pony and a unicorn.</i>

<i>like to do?</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:29.255
<i>Um... we paint,</i>

01:40.558 --> 01:42.060
<i>It's the one that I've been wanting!</i>

<i>It's the magic one.</i>

- <i>That's amazing!</i>

02:53.339 --> 02:54.257
Home again!

02:55.341 --> 02:56.801
I'm going to my room.
Uh, about that...

02:59.137 --> 02:59.971
Um...

03:06.227 --> 03:07.645
How do you like the new gym?

03:28.875 --> 03:31.377
Right, I'm ready to go.
I just got to get my...

03:31.461 --> 03:32.462
Is she okay?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.131
Huh.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.592
All right, well, we're going to work.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.469
Yeah, I'm excited. It's, uh...

03:39.552 --> 03:42.513
We have this new ropes course. Woo.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.724
Boy, these kids, it makes them dig deep.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.976
Yeah, it's really, really high up...

03:47.518 --> 03:48.519
-in the...
-The...

03:48.895 --> 03:51.814
The gangster children.
Gangster. That's--

03:51.898 --> 03:54.108
Gangster children,
they they just cry.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.277
- It's cathartic.
- Mm-hmm.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.112
-So...
-You want to come with us?

03:58.196 --> 04:01.574
-We're gonna paint our dreams.
-People don't like it when I do that.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.202
-Now, honey. Hang on.
-Explain it.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.371
-No, that's different.
-That's...

04:06.454 --> 04:08.790
Anyway, um... have a good day.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.667
A good day.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.025
-Home again!

05:17.108 --> 05:17.984
Honey!

05:18.401 --> 05:19.694
Honey, do you remember Kevin?

05:19.777 --> 05:21.487
Kevin from down the street?

05:23.239 --> 05:25.408
-Dad!
- He's back in town, sweetie.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.577
He's got an apartment right by the mall,

05:27.994 --> 05:30.747
and he has a beautiful head of hair.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.123
He's a good-looking kid.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.754
- That's him, isn't it?
- Yes.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.005
It is, I bet.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.882
-It is.
-Kevin!

05:40.965 --> 05:43.051
Oh, my God!

05:43.134 --> 05:44.635
You brought dinner!

05:44.719 --> 05:46.721
Oh, what a surprise!

05:46.804 --> 05:49.515
Wow, Kit, you look just the same.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.976
Honey, you remember Kevin.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.228
-And guess where he's working.
- Guess.

05:56.064 --> 05:56.981
I wouldn't know.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.524
-Emotion Quest!
-Emotion Quest!

05:58.608 --> 05:59.859
-Yep.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.487
I'm a youth counselor there
as of two weeks ago,

06:02.570 --> 06:05.323
thanks to Gene and Gladys here hiring me.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.240
Mm-hmm.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.619
-Honestly, thank you for changing my life.
-Oh. Oh.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.745
Oh, Kevin.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.746
Hey, Kevin.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.415
- Thank you.
- No, no, thank you.

06:14.665 --> 06:18.461
All right, well, um,
we'll just go get some pita chips,

06:18.544 --> 06:19.629
and you guys reminisce.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.922
-Oh, yeah.
-Go on, go.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.548
-You have a lot to catch up on.
-Yeah.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.760
-Go on. Come on, honey.
-Sorry, she's insane.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.845
- I heard that!
-Hey, remember, uh...

06:27.929 --> 06:31.682
Remember when you wore that golden crown
when you were a kid?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.518
You were pretty cute.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.602
Yeah, right.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.728
You were!

06:35.812 --> 06:36.896
Come on.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.731
Yeah?

06:39.690 --> 06:40.983
Well, you were kind of...

06:41.067 --> 06:42.568
Hey, take a look at this.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.072
Lisa.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.324
She works in medical billing.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.909
Pretty nice, huh?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.496
So what's your plan
now that you've been kicked out school?

06:54.330 --> 06:57.125
I mean, I think it's great
that she had the opportunity

06:57.208 --> 06:58.960
to explore the arts.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.629
It's a privilege,
and, you know, now that's over,

07:01.712 --> 07:04.424
-and we're moving on to the next chapter.
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.676
- Am I right?
- That's right. It is.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.136
How about you, Kit?

07:08.678 --> 07:09.512
Kit?

07:10.179 --> 07:11.597
Huh? I didn't hear you.

07:12.932 --> 07:16.686
Kit, you are being weird on purpose.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.190
You know, ever since you guys
turned me onto this kale,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.067
I can't get enough.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.779
Well, you can have as much as you want,
because Kit will not touch this stuff.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.114
- Well, no.
- Kit.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.782
Why don't you guys just adopt Kevin?

07:29.866 --> 07:30.908
- Kit!
- What?

07:30.992 --> 07:33.911
Huh? Then you don't have to be
embarrassed at all by my failures.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.664
-No one is calling you a failure.
-Honey, we're--

07:36.747 --> 07:38.374
We're just trying to help you.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.209
Honestly, Kit, truth be told,

07:40.293 --> 07:43.045
everything I've achieved
is super attainable.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.715
You absolutely should not feel
like you're living in my shadow.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.883
Oh, my God.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.343
Yeah, I mean, Kevin hasn't even
gone to college.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.887
Yeah, I'm just keeping busy.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.097
- Mm-hmm.
-I have a plan, okay?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.352
Temp agencies.

07:59.645 --> 08:03.483
They have hundreds of jobs
in a wide variety of qualifications.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.068
All you need to do
is a simple typing test.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.528
Just give me five minutes.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.908
Kit, you're-- you're tracking glitter
on the floor.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.412
Hey.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.956
You guys still like me, right?

08:20.124 --> 08:23.294
They would, too,
if I was Kevin the perfect.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.838
Someone with a job,

08:25.922 --> 08:28.799
someone who likes kale,
even though it's disgusting.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.261
Here...

08:34.013 --> 08:35.348
Let me help you with that.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.388
- Mmm, so delicious.
- Hmm.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.723
Hello, parents.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.977
-Is that my old suit?
- Mm-hmm. I hope you don't mind.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.147
I wanted to look polished and professional
on my first day.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.481
First day of what?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.234
Of the rest of my life.

10:10.484 --> 10:14.363
As I mentioned some time before,
I've signed up with a temporary agency

10:14.447 --> 10:18.075
and I've taken a temporary position
at a public relations firm.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.995
-Public relations!
-Relations.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.204
-Oh, my...
-Wow.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.539
-Sweetie!
-Wow!

10:23.623 --> 10:24.498
That's wonderful!

10:25.041 --> 10:27.710
Do you want, uh, some breakfast?
Can I get you a pop-tart?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.170
Oh, please. Rest your feet.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.797
I will be making a breakfast for myself

10:31.881 --> 10:34.383
consisting of grapefruits, and flax seeds,

10:34.467 --> 10:35.926
and... and coffee.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.678
Well, you don't like coffee.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.681
No, that was just old Kit,

10:40.765 --> 10:44.393
and she didn't try hard enough
to like things that are disgusting.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.854
But new Kit has achievable life goals,

10:46.937 --> 10:49.982
and she'll be working very hard
to achieve said goals.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.109
I'll probably be working very long hours
from now on,
because as I've learned
from the television set,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.613
success is all around me.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.615
-It's a breakthrough.
-It's wonderful.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.991
This is wonderful.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.618
It is.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.454
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be on my way.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.997
If either of you are out for the day,

11:05.081 --> 11:07.667
if you could please pick up
some legal pads, highlighters.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.877
I'll probably be using a lot of them
from now on.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.295
-Good day.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.838
Good day.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.655
-Oh.
-Hi.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.573
-You must be Kit.
-I am.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.534
-Great. Follow me.
-Okay.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.245
-Oh, sorry.
-You can go that way, or this way.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.288
Okay, great.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.749
Okay, first question.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.626
Do you know what magazines are?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.461
-Yes.
-Great.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.298
Do you know how to push a button
on a copier that says "copy"?

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
-Uh, yes.
-All right, great.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.846
And do you think that you could
put the magazines inside the copier

12:01.929 --> 12:04.056
before you press the button
that says "copy"?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.182
-Yes.
-Great.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.768
Then, well, you're ready to fly.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.062
Um, one of these is yours.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.066
-Oh.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.414
Hey, Bob, there's one in my cubicle.
I'll grab it for you, okay?

12:28.497 --> 12:30.583
All right, well,
we'll just try the screen on...

12:31.167 --> 12:32.001
Hmm.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.763
Oh.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.432
Do you need to use the copy machine?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.726
No, no, go ahead.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.441
You look like you really know
what you're doing there.

12:56.150 --> 13:00.529
Yeah, it's complex work, but I trained
extensively for a whole five minutes.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.621
Do you think you could do this one for me?

13:09.371 --> 13:10.206
Sure.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.415
Which part?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.168
See this article
on learning to love again?

13:14.251 --> 13:16.837
- Mm-hmm.
- I want the recipe underneath it.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.172
Lemon pound cake.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.299
I really like pound cake.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.093
-Yeah. Cake is good.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.929
-You think so?
-Mm-hmm.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.847
We like the same things.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.142
I'm Gary.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.645
Vice President...

13:33.062 --> 13:36.565
of the company, not the United States.
Though, maybe someday. Ha-ha.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.901
-What's your name?
-Kit.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.237
Today is my first day.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.364
Ooh. Welcome.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.367
Did you Google my name
before you came here today?

13:47.451 --> 13:48.285
No.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.788
But I will.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.501
Because a lot of people with my same name
have done terrible things.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.088
But this Gary's record is clean.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.595
I'll tell Crystal that we're doing lunch?

14:11.392 --> 14:15.855
-So... how was everybody's day?

14:19.149 --> 14:21.402
Well, I mean, mine was great. Awesome.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.403
Mm-hmm.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.989
How about-- how about you, Kit?

14:26.699 --> 14:27.867
Pretty good.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.993
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

14:31.036 --> 14:31.871
Mm-hmm.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.665
Did you meet some new people
or make some friends?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.458
I think so.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.921
Uh, this Vice President guy
wants to have lunch with me.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.882
Vice President?

14:42.965 --> 14:45.217
-VP, day one.
- Oh, my gosh.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.135
That's awesome.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.262
And you like what you're doing?

14:48.345 --> 14:52.516
Yeah. Everybody just, um,
wears office clothes,

14:53.017 --> 14:54.476
drinks coffee,

14:55.019 --> 14:55.853
types stuff.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.771
Wow! Well...

14:58.606 --> 15:01.025
-I mean, we knew you could do it.
- Oh, yeah.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.651
That was not a question.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.446
I just do what everybody else is doing.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.406
I love doing
what everybody else is doing.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.159
- You're so good at it.
- That's what a team is. Right?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.994
That's what we tell the kids
at Emotion Quest.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.579
Look at this. What is that?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.998
Two people doing the same thing.
Holding hands.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.959
-Two people, one thing. Powerful.
- That's right, Gene.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.961
I'm so glad
you're having this experience.

15:21.045 --> 15:21.879
Me too.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.047
Me too.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.257
I haven't had a date
in like three weeks.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.301
Are you still using
that super sad profile picture?

15:27.384 --> 15:29.261
It's not sad.
It's like a neutral expression.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.014
Okay, but guys don't want
super sad girlfriends.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.059
They want happy girlfriends,
who smile, like this.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.064
Are you making fun of me?

15:40.564 --> 15:41.982
Oh, no, I'm just listening.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.692
And who are you?

15:44.109 --> 15:45.152
I'm Kit.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.696
You're Kit.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.490
I'm Crystal.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.951
Gary's assistant.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.788
Hey, Kit. Looking good.
Got a letter for you.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.503
Holy shit. Brock wants you.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.464
Hilarious, because they don't
even know each other, right?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.424
You've worked here for what,
like, two seconds?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.467
Get ready.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.971
Get ready for what?

16:14.056 --> 16:17.142
Um... did you guys get one of these?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.355
I don't know, but if that is a party,
I better get one.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.232
Mm-hmm.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.483
Mm-hmm.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.199
- Beautiful.
- Hmm?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.701
The sound of a copy machine.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.578
Oh, yeah, it's like...

16:37.121 --> 16:38.539
the seashore in here.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.582
-You're funny.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.209
Like that Seinfeld.
When did I hire you?

16:44.586 --> 16:46.046
You didn't. I'm just a temp.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.966
I have a kind of personal question
for you.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.259
I'd love to answer it.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.260
Okay.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.430
Did you always know
that this was what you wanted to do,

16:54.888 --> 16:57.850
or did you want to do another thing first?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.687
Like, what?
Like, did I dream of figure skating,

17:01.770 --> 17:04.023
but my parents wouldn't pay
for the lessons?

17:04.606 --> 17:05.441
Sure.

17:18.704 --> 17:23.125
Why not wish we could fly? We can't,
so we focus on what we can do.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.835
Which is what?

17:25.252 --> 17:28.589
Creating the artwork
for the new Mystic Vac Vacuum.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.175
Oh. What makes it mystical?

17:31.258 --> 17:32.384
What, indeed.

17:34.136 --> 17:38.390
You know, I was in a class where we had
to do fake ads for McDonalds and Ikea,

17:38.474 --> 17:41.143
and I came with McSalsa and chips.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.521
See, that's already
ten times more interesting

17:44.605 --> 17:46.315
than anything I've heard today.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.236
There is zero creativity in this company
and it is killing me.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.616
Can I see your portfolio?

17:55.699 --> 17:58.535
What? No. Uh, it's from school.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.079
Bring it in.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.499
You don't want to be a temp forever,
do you?

18:04.458 --> 18:06.251
No, I guess I don't.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.732
Kit, what are you still doing here?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.652
Do you know about a place
called The Store?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.281
Ooh, is it like a cool pop-up?
Because I never go anywhere fun.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.533
-I don't know what it is.
-Oh.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.786
Okay. Well, I should go because
there's a new <i>Dateline </i>on tonight

19:22.870 --> 19:24.746
about professional single women
getting murdered,

19:24.830 --> 19:26.123
and I should probably watch that.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.127
Yeah. Uh, I'm just gonna
go get office supplies.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.962
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.139
Oh, come on.

20:42.157 --> 20:46.286
<i>♪ You take me all the way there ♪</i>

20:48.038 --> 20:53.126
<i>♪ Flying us in on a wing and a prayer ♪</i>

21:26.243 --> 21:28.161
- Don't touch that.
-Ah! Whoa!

21:29.454 --> 21:30.580
Just kidding.

21:30.664 --> 21:31.540
Come in.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.250
Come in!

21:34.376 --> 21:36.128
You want a diet Coke?
You like those, right?

21:36.211 --> 21:37.379
What is this place?

21:37.921 --> 21:38.755
Who are you?

21:38.839 --> 21:41.842
You have come to The Store, Kit.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.014
And I am The Salesman.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.226
What's The Store?

21:52.185 --> 21:54.855
-How do you know my name?
- You're here.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.150
-But I could be anybody.
-No, you can't.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.277
We only invited you.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.071
How do you know where I work?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.782
And also, are you gonna murder me?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.995
Murder?

22:10.370 --> 22:11.204
Kit!

22:11.288 --> 22:14.624
This is a legitimate place of business.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.710
And the opposite of murder.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.337
What kind of business?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.672
We sell what you want.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.177
What you need.

22:25.635 --> 22:26.928
Which is what?

22:27.220 --> 22:29.973
Oh, you think you don't know,
but you totally know. I know.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.725
-You do?
-Isn't it obvious?

22:31.808 --> 22:32.809
No.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.561
-Isn't it?
-No, it's not. No.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.104
Think about it.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.196
Unicorns?

22:44.571 --> 22:45.906
Unicorns.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.240
Behold!

22:48.075 --> 22:49.451
Oh, Kit!

22:49.785 --> 22:52.621
Don't you want to just jump
into that screen

22:52.704 --> 22:57.751
and hug the shit out of your very own
precious pink unicorn?

22:58.460 --> 22:59.503
Braid its hair?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.421
Sing it songs?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.173
Bake it cookies?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.301
Yes.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.678
But unicorns aren't real.

23:09.888 --> 23:14.851
As a person who works in a unicorn store,

23:15.519 --> 23:17.270
I take great offense in that.

23:17.646 --> 23:21.566
Just allow me to show you around,

23:22.275 --> 23:25.028
and then you decide, okay?

23:27.489 --> 23:30.617
This is our Recreation Area,

23:30.700 --> 23:32.869
with pillows and ottomans,

23:32.953 --> 23:34.037
sugar cubes,

23:34.788 --> 23:35.789
and wi-fi.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.377
This is where we bring them
when they first arrive.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.130
Do they ride up the elevator?

23:45.465 --> 23:50.220
When the unicorns arrive, they can be
a little dingy from the various forests,

23:50.303 --> 23:52.681
you know, covered in leaves,
and berries, and shit,

23:52.764 --> 23:54.641
so we wash them off,

23:55.058 --> 23:58.562
brush their hair, and shiny them up a bit.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.647
-Where are the unicorns now?
-Oh...

24:01.064 --> 24:03.942
They don't arrive here until you're ready.

24:04.943 --> 24:05.986
And here...

24:06.736 --> 24:09.364
we have our fine dining establishment,

24:09.448 --> 24:12.701
or Hay-staurant, as we like to call it.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.744
It doesn't smell like hay.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.204
I know.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.624
The unicorns, they don't like that.

24:19.708 --> 24:24.004
-And this is the ice cream parlor.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.922
Unicorns eat ice cream?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.592
Of course not, Kit, but I do.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.636
Look, Kit.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.558
I think you're smart enough to see
what's happening here.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.560
See the truth.
Ah.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.107
Behold!

24:45.317 --> 24:47.152
The magic hair...

24:47.694 --> 24:50.572
of a unicorn long gone.

24:52.157 --> 24:52.991
Feel it.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.248
It feels electric.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.210
-It feels like--
-Happiness.

25:05.629 --> 25:10.091
A unicorn will love you forever, Kit.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.386
Forever.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.388
Forever.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.308
I don't like this.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.769
This isn't real, and I'm--
I'm a business lady now.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.854
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna buy graph paper!

25:22.938 --> 25:24.564
Graph paper can't love you back.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.529
<i>We sell what you want.</i>
<i>What you need.</i>

25:38.703 --> 25:39.996
Can I help you?

25:41.957 --> 25:42.791
Maybe.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.459
Let me ask you this.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.294
It's not about office supplies.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.379
I have a girlfriend.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.923
What? No, that's not what I was gonna ask.
Um...

25:50.340 --> 25:53.301
I just saw something
that I don't believe to be true.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.346
But now it seems like it could be true,

25:56.429 --> 25:57.347
and it would be...

25:57.889 --> 25:59.307
really good if it was.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.309
Like Jesus?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.478
No. Or-- or... yeah.

26:03.853 --> 26:08.233
Yeah. Because people do think
that they really see Jesus, right?

26:08.316 --> 26:10.068
And then other people say
that they're nuts

26:10.151 --> 26:12.612
because Jesus isn't just
walking around on this earth,

26:12.696 --> 26:14.864
but the people who do believe it
really do,

26:14.948 --> 26:18.577
and who are we to say what's real
or not real

26:18.660 --> 26:20.453
in the mind of the true believer?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.708
What was the question again?

26:25.709 --> 26:26.793
I guess it's...

26:27.669 --> 26:29.921
How do you know
that they'll love you forever?

26:30.922 --> 26:32.382
It's what they're born to do.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.053
It is the best thing in the world.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.223
I want to see one up close.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.308
And you will.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.769
But first there are...
certain requirements.

26:48.815 --> 26:49.983
Requirements?

26:50.066 --> 26:54.863
Bringing a unicorn here is not an easy
or inexpensive endeavor.

26:55.447 --> 26:59.868
You have to be the right sort of girl.

27:00.994 --> 27:01.828
Huh.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.624
The right sort of girl.

27:07.792 --> 27:08.710
Okay.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.381
This is crazy.

27:13.923 --> 27:14.841
Okay.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.761
What kinds of things would I have to do?

27:21.973 --> 27:22.807
Requirement one.

27:29.939 --> 27:33.693
Build a home worthy of a unicorn.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.738
Understand, Kit Kat,

27:37.989 --> 27:39.658
if I have one brought here,

27:40.784 --> 27:43.244
I have to know that you're for real.

27:45.121 --> 27:49.125
But I think you and your unicorn
could have a great future.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.213
If you want it.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.009
When I was a kid,
I asked my parents for a unicorn.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.928
A real one, not pretend.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.099
And it would be so filled
with love and magic

28:04.182 --> 28:06.017
that we wouldn't need anything else.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.980
It was the only thing I ever wanted.

28:15.026 --> 28:15.860
I know.

28:18.238 --> 28:22.617
"Unicorn ownership is both a rewarding
and serious undertaking.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.621
In order to ensure the safety
and happiness of said magical creature,

28:27.038 --> 28:28.498
you must first build a home

28:28.873 --> 28:30.542
worthy of your unicorn."

28:35.088 --> 28:36.297
Unicorn.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.929
-Uh, excuse me, sir.
-Yeah.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.764
I'm in the market for some lumber.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.766
What are you building?

28:46.850 --> 28:51.646
Mmm, it's like your basic
sort of structure for a horse,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.064
but smaller than a horse.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.358
Do you have dimensions
for this horse?

28:55.859 --> 28:57.235
I don't.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.779
-But it's like--
-Virgil, come in.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.865
You know,
I can't help you right now, lady.

29:01.948 --> 29:02.824
Like that tall.

29:02.907 --> 29:06.619
But, um, you need to talk to Virgil.
He can help you right out, okay?

29:06.703 --> 29:08.204
-Okay.
-Damn it, Virgil, what's your 20?

29:16.379 --> 29:18.590
-You looking for something?
-Oh, sorry.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.966
Are you Virgil?

29:20.049 --> 29:22.177
I was told by that guy
with the walkie-talkie

29:22.260 --> 29:24.888
in the lumber section
to talk to a guy named Virgil.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.848
Yeah. Is there a problem?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.183
Oh, no. Sorry. Um...

29:28.475 --> 29:32.312
He just said that you might help me
with some work I need done on my house.

29:32.395 --> 29:35.482
Well, I sweep floors and count inventory.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.651
Is that what you need done at your house?
Need me to count some stuff?

29:39.235 --> 29:42.113
Huh, you don't really look like a Virgil.

29:42.947 --> 29:43.907
Okay.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.575
What do I look like?

29:46.201 --> 29:49.204
I don't know. It's just, when he said
the name Virgil, I was sort of relieved,

29:49.287 --> 29:53.416
because that name doesn't really sound
like a hardware store guy type name,

29:53.500 --> 29:56.085
and, like, Virgil seems like someone
I can relate to, like...

29:56.169 --> 29:58.922
like Virgil was an outcast in school,
like me.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.048
Wow.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.842
But you don't seem like that.
That's my point.

30:02.926 --> 30:06.179
Like, you look like
you could be named Jack or... Fox.

30:06.262 --> 30:09.182
-Fox?
-Yeah. Sorry. These are compliments.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.475
Okay. Well, look.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.728
Um, I don't really go out on field jobs.
The store doesn't send me out.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.689
-So I think you're better off with Joel.
-Oh, but Joel can't do it.

30:16.773 --> 30:17.690
-Why not?
-Or...

30:17.774 --> 30:20.026
he just doesn't want to do it, I think.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.361
Please!

30:21.903 --> 30:24.447
He said that you might take it
on the side. Wink, wink.
I don't know why Joel
would say that or why he would wink.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.117
Joel hates me.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.996
No. No, no. I think that he really does
believe in your skills and talents,

30:32.080 --> 30:32.914
just secretly.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.458
Um, I think he secretly is hoping

30:35.542 --> 30:37.836
that I'll die
in a terrible power tool accident.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.589
So maybe you'll do it?

30:42.465 --> 30:44.717
Maybe I'll think about it. What's the job?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.270
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.272
You bring something to show me?

30:57.355 --> 30:59.816
But more important than that...
how are you?

30:59.899 --> 31:04.112
I'm good. I'm good.
I brought my portfolio to show you.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.613
Ah.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.158
And I see you're taking a crack
at the cursed vacuums.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.076
I am.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.662
So, at first I started working on it,

31:12.745 --> 31:14.956
like, making them kind of like
cartoon Pokemons,

31:15.039 --> 31:18.209
and-- and that was really cute,
but it's not professional,

31:18.293 --> 31:21.004
so I did this now,

31:21.087 --> 31:23.882
uh, and it's on graph paper.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.091
-I like that.
-Mm-hmm.

31:25.174 --> 31:26.509
-I like that.
-Mm-hmm.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.052
Is your shampoo coconut?

31:30.972 --> 31:31.806
Yes.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.268
I'm saving up for an island.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.896
You know, small, someplace remote.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.023
Plenty of sand.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.277
What are your, uh, long-term goals?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.989
Uh, I would like to not be
a great disappointment.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.532
But...

31:49.616 --> 31:51.409
like, part-time or full-time?

31:51.826 --> 31:52.660
Which--

31:52.744 --> 31:54.662
-Let's get back to these vacuums, okay?
-Okay.

31:54.746 --> 31:55.788
See what you can do.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.791
Hey, you need a bigger space.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.504
I think you could have
a really great future here, Kit,

32:04.923 --> 32:05.924
if you want it.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.223
I need to find anything
that you might have on unicorns.

32:14.682 --> 32:18.061
Um, specifically information
on their habitats,

32:18.144 --> 32:20.813
and expenses, and maintenance.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.401
There are a few texts
on the mythology of unicorns.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.904
-Okay, yeah, I'll take all of those.
-Okay.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.325
- Kit, is someone at the door?
-No.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.494
-Sweetie?
-Hi. Come on in.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.080
-We're going to be going this way.
- Kit! We're in the gym.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.539
-Okay. Okay.
-Whoa.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.625
Just down here.

32:42.543 --> 32:43.503
Sorry.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.172
It's just, if my mom sees you,
she'll think that you're my boyfriend

32:46.255 --> 32:48.716
-and invite you to Christmas.
-Oh, I'm not coming to Christmas.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.717
No, I know.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.469
Oh.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.554
-Who did all this?
-Don't look at these.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.140
-These are my artistic failures.
-According to who?

32:56.557 --> 32:58.601
Uh, Professor Jonathan Scott.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.896
I took his class.
He's extremely prolific in the art world.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.065
"Stick in a box."

33:05.233 --> 33:06.859
Yeah, sounds like an idiot.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.444
No, he's not an idiot.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.280
He's the first artist
to put a stick in a box.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.783
Very cutting-edge at the time.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.202
So this is the space.

33:17.203 --> 33:20.206
Okay, so what do you want done?
You want a ceiling fan?

33:20.456 --> 33:22.458
Dressers, bookshelves?

33:22.750 --> 33:24.919
No, I'm thinking of something better.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.005
Like a stable.
A horse stable?

33:28.881 --> 33:31.926
Yeah, but for something like a horse...

33:32.010 --> 33:33.720
Smaller than a horse, like a pony.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.596
-A pony?
-Mm-hmm.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.848
But better than a pony.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.099
Okay.

33:38.725 --> 33:39.559
Um...

33:40.059 --> 33:43.312
You know, I don't think a pony
wants to live in your basement.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.607
That's a good point.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.110
I don't even want to live here.

33:49.193 --> 33:53.406
Well, I guess you have enough room
for a... stable out here.

33:53.489 --> 33:54.907
Mmm. Okay. Great.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.368
Is there a way for you to do it tomorrow?

33:57.452 --> 33:58.911
-No.
-Why?

33:58.995 --> 34:02.915
It's just your straight,
you know, garden variety,

34:03.750 --> 34:07.920
-you know, generic brand horse stable.
-Uh, can't do it.

34:09.088 --> 34:10.590
-Sure you can.
-Well, I can't.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.842
And, you know, it's a little sexist
that you think so.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.511
Not every man who walks the Earth
knows how to build amazing things
-with his bare hands, okay?
- Okay. It's--

34:18.264 --> 34:20.600
I get your point, but it's not sexist.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.935
It's just, you work at a hardware store.

34:23.019 --> 34:25.021
-You guys can do anything.

34:25.354 --> 34:27.106
Wow, that's really cute.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.317
Well, how about-- Okay.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.903
How about we use this?
How about we use my, um...

34:33.071 --> 34:35.073
Okay, the doorknob thing
was a little dramatic, but--

34:35.156 --> 34:35.990
Yeah.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.786
There's tons of stuff out of this
that we could use, right?

34:39.869 --> 34:41.287
Is that your playhouse?

34:41.370 --> 34:42.747
Yeah, it was.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.957
My dad built it for me when I was a kid.

34:45.875 --> 34:46.834
What do you think?

34:47.168 --> 34:51.380
Uh, that-- that seems like
a fundamentally bad idea.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.300
-Okay, so it's 50% rotted, that's true.
-Mm-hmm.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.094
But we could use some of the wood.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.639
And build a new thing out of this.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.308
- Just like that.
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.309
Please?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.394
You don't even know me.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.856
But I know you have a tape measure.

35:17.073 --> 35:17.907
Okay.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.368
Yes, we're doing it!

35:21.035 --> 35:22.036
-Okay.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.913
Whoa! All right, is that okay?

35:23.996 --> 35:24.831
Yeah.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.207
-All right.
-You do it.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.834
Sure. Okay. Um...

35:27.917 --> 35:28.876
Go, go, go!

35:30.920 --> 35:31.754
Yeah!

35:37.635 --> 35:39.762
- Yeah.
- We'll just use a hammer.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.765
So, I'm building a stable
in my backyard.

35:42.849 --> 35:46.477
Well, actually, I hired a man to do it
and it's gonna be awesome.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.728
So what's next?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.272
When do I get to meet the unicorn?

35:49.605 --> 35:50.439
Behold!

35:50.523 --> 35:51.899
Oh, my God!

35:52.733 --> 35:54.485
The magical horn

35:54.569 --> 35:56.654
of a unicorn long gone.

35:56.737 --> 35:57.613
Touch it.

35:58.447 --> 35:59.407
Pick it up.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.204
Oh, it's so heavy!

36:05.288 --> 36:07.707
That's because it's full of love.

36:07.790 --> 36:11.210
Oh, no, not really.
They're all just really heavy.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.796
So, what happened to him?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.798
What happens to any of us

36:15.882 --> 36:18.176
that doesn't learn to love another thing?

36:19.135 --> 36:21.179
Oh, Kit.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.723
It is so wonderful...

36:24.473 --> 36:26.225
that you're taking in a unicorn.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.643
Hmm.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.188
Now that you've built this foundation,

36:30.271 --> 36:33.316
we need to start thinking
about your long-term goals.

36:33.858 --> 36:38.529
How to feed your unicorn in body and mind.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.827
And proof of financial responsibility
and some other forms speculating on--

36:45.995 --> 36:47.997
Oh, my God. Look at the time.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.874
You're gonna be late for work!

36:49.957 --> 36:51.542
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.419
Get out there and show us what you can do.

36:53.502 --> 36:54.378
I will!

36:55.046 --> 36:57.465
Oh, where have you been?
Crystal keeps asking me where you are.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.508
I just went to Whole Foods
to pick up some hay,
but they didn't have it,
so the trip was pointless.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.680
What do you need hay for? Oh, wait,
are you doing like a cool diet thing?

37:04.764 --> 37:08.059
Because let me tell you this. I tried
the 30-day fiber fun diet for seven days.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.519
It did not do anything
and I did not have any fun.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.271
-Hey.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.691
Uh, step into my office.
I'd love to speak with you for a minute.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.361
Is it personal?
I can clear up my schedule.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.489
Beautiful.

37:22.531 --> 37:26.827
Gary, I have been thinking a lot
about my long-term goals.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.538
I don't want to be a temp forever.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.458
I want to be full-time, maybe.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.337
I want to show you what I can do.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.340
I would like to see what that looks like.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.258
You would?

37:40.341 --> 37:43.469
Let's have you meet with the whole
Mystic Vac team next Monday.

37:43.552 --> 37:45.680
Show us what you're thinking. Yeah?

37:46.597 --> 37:49.976
Oh. Like, the whole team? Like...

37:50.601 --> 37:52.311
Like a presentation? Okay.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.938
-Don't be afraid, Kit.
-I'm not.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.691
I'm just kind of like busy.

37:57.066 --> 38:02.989
There's a superstar deep, deep,
deep inside you there, somewhere.

38:03.072 --> 38:07.410
We just need to take all these layers off
and let her out of there.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.372
Does she want to come out of there?

38:13.082 --> 38:16.210
-Yeah, I think that she does.
- She totally does!

38:18.754 --> 38:19.588
Yeah.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.382
She totally does.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.844
I can't believe

38:25.177 --> 38:27.305
that you built real walls!

38:27.388 --> 38:29.682
-Calm down.
-You built real walls!

38:29.765 --> 38:32.518
Well, I watched YouTube videos
on making real walls.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.812
-Well, I think it's working.
-Ah...

38:35.479 --> 38:38.733
I keep looking at 'em to make sure they're
not gonna fall down, and they haven't yet.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.568
Kit, dinner's ready!

38:40.651 --> 38:41.986
I'll order pizza!

38:42.361 --> 38:43.279
Oh!

38:43.362 --> 38:46.365
Sorry, that's my mom.
She's just... super annoying.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.617
She's super annoying
'cause she wants to make you dinner?

38:48.701 --> 38:50.411
-Oh, sorry.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.289
What, Mom? What? I'm busy.
I'm doing something.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.792
What are you guys doing out there?
Come in, have some quinoa.

38:56.876 --> 39:01.005
Uh...
Sorry, service is really bad. Bye.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.385
-So.
-So?

39:06.469 --> 39:08.429
Do your parents call you, like, every day?

39:08.512 --> 39:09.430
No, they're dead.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.974
-Oh, my God.
-No, I'm just kidding. No.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.809
They're--they're still alive. But...

39:14.935 --> 39:16.645
-So mean!
-Yeah, it's really bad.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.897
Um... but...

39:19.398 --> 39:20.232
I don't know.

39:20.941 --> 39:23.486
I guess they're just busy
with their own lives.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.948
So, what do you think about this wood?

39:28.157 --> 39:31.243
Is it strong enough
to withstand something kind of...

39:32.453 --> 39:35.289
like, sharp and pointy stabbing it?

39:35.998 --> 39:37.375
-Kit?
-Hmm.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.293
Why are you building this?

39:41.128 --> 39:42.421
It's a surprise.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.383
Okay.

39:45.883 --> 39:48.594
Okay, you know something--
You know what? I get paid either way.

39:48.677 --> 39:49.512
Yeah.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.851
<i>Now, for the next step,</i>

39:55.935 --> 39:58.729
<i>we're gonna put our siding</i>
<i>on our framed wall.</i>

39:58.813 --> 40:00.815
<i>Wanna grab a screw, your drill…</i>

40:00.898 --> 40:01.899
-Stop.
-What?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.360
<i>...and your wood.</i>

40:10.616 --> 40:13.911
Can I give you a little friendly advice
from one woman to another?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.622
Okay. You just don't sound very friendly.

40:16.705 --> 40:20.626
There is zero chance that Gary is going
to pick your presentation, okay?

40:21.085 --> 40:23.921
You're not gonna save the day
with your little vacuum cartoons.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.132
Aaron and Matt are already on the account,

40:26.215 --> 40:30.886
and they are for real superstars
who actually know what they are doing.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.140
I'm not trying to save the day.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.434
Oh, I just-- I just bet you weren't.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.269
And Gary really does believe in me.

40:38.352 --> 40:39.854
You're not special!

40:39.937 --> 40:40.771
Okay?

40:42.815 --> 40:44.233
We've all been there before.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.819
Enjoy it while it lasts.

41:35.409 --> 41:37.203
Kit, is something wrong?

41:37.536 --> 41:40.623
That's quite a lot of food for a 30-minute
road trip you got going on in here.

41:40.706 --> 41:44.084
You're gonna be thanking me when we're
30 minutes in the middle of nowhere

41:44.168 --> 41:46.629
-and all you want are some Bugles.
- Okay.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.923
- Let's see what we got.
-Oh.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.799
Wait. I love this song!

41:50.883 --> 41:54.678
<i>♪ You take me all the way there</i> ♪

41:56.388 --> 42:01.685
<i>♪ Flying us in on wing and a prayer ♪</i>

42:01.977 --> 42:04.980
<i>♪ And once we were worlds apart ♪</i>

42:05.147 --> 42:07.942
<i>♪ But hey, that's just how it starts ♪</i>

42:08.192 --> 42:12.446
<i>♪ You take me the all the way there ♪</i>

42:12.863 --> 42:14.490
<i>♪ All the way ♪</i>

42:18.285 --> 42:19.995
-That was impressive.
- Oh.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.458
Thank you for driving.
I know that you don't want to be here.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.585
What? No, I-I-I wanna be here.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.671
I'm-- I'm happy, I'm-- I'm excited.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.214
I'm pumped.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.507
I'm getting hay.

42:31.799 --> 42:32.841
- Hay!
-Hay!

42:33.175 --> 42:34.218
Hay, hay, hay.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.596
-Question.
- Yes.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.390
Am I pretty enough
to be sexually harassed?

42:39.473 --> 42:42.351
What? What, no, who-- who--
who are you talking about?

42:43.394 --> 42:44.353
My boss, Gary.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.647
He's older, but in that sort of
old-fashioned way,

42:46.730 --> 42:49.650
where they like to open doors for you
and smell your hair.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.736
Um, no, that's-- that's not okay.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.614
-That's not okay at all.
-But Crystal says he does it to everybody.

42:56.156 --> 42:59.743
Oh, my God.

43:01.912 --> 43:02.746
Hmm.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.999
This here is our three-way hay.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.085
Uh, wheat, oats, and barley.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.336
-Okay.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.338
Okay, but does it taste good?

43:11.755 --> 43:13.173
You'll have to ask the cows.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.427
Oh. Should we talk to the cows?

43:16.510 --> 43:18.345
We should talk to the cows, I think.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.974
-Are we supposed to load?
-I-- you know what?

43:22.057 --> 43:22.891
You don't know?

43:22.975 --> 43:24.643
Have you ever been
in this situation before?

43:24.727 --> 43:26.562
No, this is the first time,
surprisingly enough.

43:26.645 --> 43:27.855
-Okay, well...
-Um, let's see.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.106
-It's not far.
-All right.

43:29.189 --> 43:30.649
One, two, three.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.903
- All right. A little bit--
- Heavy.

43:34.987 --> 43:36.614
Oh, gosh. I have to set it down.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.407
-There's just so much--
-Oh.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.787
Are you really getting a horse?

43:43.871 --> 43:44.705
Um...

43:45.247 --> 43:46.248
Basically.

43:47.416 --> 43:50.628
I think that you're doing
a really good job with the power tools.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.421
Sorry for the wait.

43:55.758 --> 43:56.842
I'll load it for you.

44:49.895 --> 44:53.107
<i>I'm getting really nervous</i>
<i>about this presentation,</i>

44:53.190 --> 44:55.693
<i>because I keep trying to draw vacuums</i>

44:56.402 --> 44:58.654
and every time I do,
I just want to draw rainbow kittens.

44:58.737 --> 45:00.364
Well, yeah, you're human.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.242
But you have until Monday
to come up with something, yeah?

45:03.325 --> 45:05.411
I am going to lock myself in my house,

45:05.494 --> 45:07.413
-because I will have it all to myself...
-Ooh.

45:07.496 --> 45:10.708
...and focus, focus, focus
on drawing vacuums.

45:16.505 --> 45:18.132
What are you guys doing in here?

45:18.465 --> 45:20.718
Honey, what-- what is this?

45:20.801 --> 45:23.178
Why-- why are you going through my stuff?

45:23.262 --> 45:29.268
I am so sorry, Kit, that we didn't
build you a better playhouse.

45:29.351 --> 45:30.602
Is that what this is?

45:30.686 --> 45:32.730
- Ask her.
-Is that what you're building?

45:32.813 --> 45:35.524
The thing outside with the guy and...

45:36.066 --> 45:38.360
Are you building another place?

45:38.819 --> 45:41.280
Are you building a better place?

45:41.488 --> 45:42.823
-For...
-For your...

45:43.073 --> 45:45.909
For your... imaginary friend?

45:46.869 --> 45:50.038
No! I don't have an imaginary friend.

45:50.539 --> 45:53.167
-Ask her again.
-It's totally fine.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.127
It's nothing. It's private.

45:55.210 --> 45:57.629
Honey, I'm holding some hay.

45:58.046 --> 46:00.007
Get out! Get out of my space!

46:00.090 --> 46:01.550
-That hurts.
-All right.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.552
Well, I'm hearing stuff from her now.

46:03.635 --> 46:06.805
-Are you hearing things?
-Yes, her-- she's attacking.

46:07.055 --> 46:09.433
I understand, but I think
we need to honor that.

46:09.516 --> 46:11.185
So, please go.

46:11.393 --> 46:14.438
We will give you your space,
but we're gonna--

46:14.855 --> 46:16.648
we're gonna talk about this on Monday.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.568
I'm not making an appointment with you
to talk about this.

46:19.651 --> 46:21.653
-No, I'm not.
- You don't need an appointment.

46:21.737 --> 46:22.905
But we'll do it Monday.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.949
-Uh, you want me to leave this open, hun?
-Close it.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.577
<i>I don't know how to be a grown-up,</i>

46:28.660 --> 46:32.498
my parents think that I'm insane,
and I have no idea what Gary is thinking,

46:32.581 --> 46:35.542
except he wants to help me
remove all my layers.

46:35.626 --> 46:36.960
Hmm, hello.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.213
Now you're living life.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.839
What's the next requirement?

46:44.802 --> 46:48.347
I don't know if you're ready
for that one yet.

46:48.430 --> 46:51.308
Of course I'm ready. I'm building a home
worthy of a unicorn.

46:51.391 --> 46:52.559
I've got plenty of hay.

46:53.018 --> 46:54.102
What's left?

46:54.603 --> 46:57.439
What? I got to hang a magic rainbow
on my kitchen or some shit?

47:05.113 --> 47:07.074
"Surround the unicorn with love.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.701
Hatred in your heart
is like a dagger to hers."

47:09.785 --> 47:11.870
And what do you think about that?

47:11.954 --> 47:13.914
"Surround it with love." I can do that.

47:14.832 --> 47:17.167
That's like hugging, right?
I can totally hug a unicorn.

47:17.251 --> 47:20.921
Maybe you just need
to figure this one out for yourself.

47:24.716 --> 47:26.385
"Caring for your unicorn.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.846
Do you have enough love in your life
for this unicorn?

47:28.929 --> 47:31.056
Do you have
a nurturing family environment?

47:31.557 --> 47:35.477
Will your unicorn live in a happy home
with a well-developed support system?

47:35.561 --> 47:37.229
I don't know Kit, will it?

47:38.146 --> 47:39.898
Yes, it will. What are you implying?

47:39.982 --> 47:45.237
Unicorns need loving vibes.

47:45.320 --> 47:49.533
They're very sensitive
to negative energies in the home.

47:49.616 --> 47:52.411
I don't have negative energies.

47:52.494 --> 47:53.912
I have loving energies,

47:53.996 --> 47:56.206
and this unicorn is gonna love
all of my energies,

47:56.290 --> 48:00.127
and if she doesn't, then she can just
go back to her sad little forest, okay?

48:02.546 --> 48:07.759
Has anyone ever told you
you are a very selfish person?

48:08.051 --> 48:08.886
Huh?

48:09.136 --> 48:12.347
You think everything in this store
is for you?

48:13.682 --> 48:15.475
Well, you kind of said it was.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.855
You think a store
is only customers,

48:19.938 --> 48:24.234
or did it ever occur to you
that maybe, just maybe,

48:24.318 --> 48:26.528
the salespeople on the other side

48:26.612 --> 48:30.699
have their own lives, their own dreams,
their own reasons

48:30.782 --> 48:33.952
for selling the things that they sell?

48:34.912 --> 48:36.538
Jeez Louise!

48:46.006 --> 48:48.383
<i>Having been separated</i>
<i>from her parents,</i>

48:48.467 --> 48:51.303
<i>the runt of the litter</i>
<i>is left to fend for herself.</i>

48:51.929 --> 48:54.056
<i>She wanders</i>
<i>the plains of the Serengeti alone...</i>

48:55.390 --> 48:57.100
<i>...searching for food...</i>

48:57.768 --> 48:59.519
<i>and for her parents...</i>

49:00.771 --> 49:02.814
<i>...unaware that far away,</i>

49:03.398 --> 49:05.776
<i>-her herd is in search of her as well.</i>
- <i>Row! Row!</i>

49:07.235 --> 49:09.821
-Row! Row!
- Woo! Who's feeling good now?

49:09.905 --> 49:12.824
I think that rowing is
you're reaching into the future,

49:12.908 --> 49:14.451
you're pushing away the past.

49:14.701 --> 49:16.495
-Into the future!
- Into the future!

49:16.578 --> 49:18.580
-Push the past!
- Push the past!

49:18.664 --> 49:19.998
Into the future, that's it.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.709
This is where that kale
really comes into play.

49:23.293 --> 49:26.755
We're not going anywhere.
Push that past behind and row.

49:26.838 --> 49:29.174
-Sweetie, you're doing great.
- Row!

49:29.257 --> 49:31.051
Grow! Grow!

49:31.134 --> 49:32.803
- Woo!
-All right!

49:32.886 --> 49:34.054
Guys, you did great.

49:34.137 --> 49:37.849
-Boat's secure. You did great, guys.
- You really did great. Yeah!

49:37.933 --> 49:39.184
I'm proud of you.

49:39.267 --> 49:40.727
-We did it!
-How about this one?

49:40.811 --> 49:42.145
You're amazing!

49:42.229 --> 49:45.065
I'm just glad that we're,
you know, talking, and...

49:45.148 --> 49:46.066
Yeah.

49:46.358 --> 49:49.611
I-I really just want our house
to be a happy one.

49:49.695 --> 49:51.279
- Yes. Yeah.
-We do, too, sweetie.

49:51.363 --> 49:52.656
-Yeah, of course.
-Yeah.

49:52.739 --> 49:54.950
Well, we're happy that you made it.

49:55.033 --> 49:56.952
Yeah! Yeah.

49:57.327 --> 49:58.203
Hey, Kit!

49:58.286 --> 49:59.705
Great job with the canoe.

50:00.122 --> 50:03.333
Yeah, once these tents are up,
we're gonna start the Truth Circle.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.545
Kevin's challenging himself
to do the tent by himself today.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.755
-Kev!
- That looks kind of dangerous.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.841
-I don't want him to get hurt. Kev!
- Uh-oh.

50:10.924 --> 50:11.758
Hang on.

50:12.134 --> 50:15.387
LPI. LPI. Remember our tools?

50:15.929 --> 50:17.305
You ready for Truth Circle?

50:18.432 --> 50:20.684
Yeah, what is Truth Circle, exactly?

50:20.976 --> 50:23.854
In my opinion, Truth Circle is bullshit,
is what it is.

50:23.937 --> 50:26.606
Yeah, try to cry a lot
or they think you're blocking

50:26.690 --> 50:30.444
and you'll have to go hiking
with your own spirit-self or some shit.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.779
-Why did you guys have to come here?
-Whatever.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.698
I swear I didn't know I was pregnant.

50:35.699 --> 50:36.533
Oh, shit.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.493
She's totally kidding.

50:39.286 --> 50:42.789
We just make stuff up,
like, for Truth Circle. We lie.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.834
-Oh.
- Yeah. They'll believe anything.

50:45.917 --> 50:47.586
My psycho parents hate me.

50:47.669 --> 50:50.756
They just... grabbed all my tube tops.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.924
And they're all, like,
"We're burning these up."

50:53.008 --> 50:55.594
Just burning them up
like that campfire right there.

50:55.677 --> 50:56.511
Wow.

50:57.095 --> 50:58.555
How did that make you feel?

50:58.638 --> 51:02.184
Oh, my God, like, so sad
for all my tube tops.

51:03.101 --> 51:05.062
-That's a great share.
-Yeah, good share.

51:05.145 --> 51:06.438
-Good share.

51:07.064 --> 51:07.939
Thank you.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.775
Maybe I just like to draw pictures.

51:10.650 --> 51:11.902
Maybe I just like knives.

51:12.778 --> 51:16.031
Maybe I just like
to draw pictures of knives.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.867
It doesn't mean I'm gonna do anything...

51:19.785 --> 51:21.203
to my algebra teacher.

51:21.536 --> 51:23.163
-Do you--
-That's--

51:23.830 --> 51:26.291
That's right, it doesn't mean that.
Mm-hmm.

51:26.374 --> 51:29.377
And then, uh, my parents bought a dog.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.380
And, uh, at first I thought it was cute,

51:32.714 --> 51:36.176
and then they took it
on a Disney vacation...

51:36.259 --> 51:37.094
Mm-hmm.

51:37.177 --> 51:38.136
Without me.

51:38.220 --> 51:39.054
-Oh.
-Oh.

51:39.513 --> 51:43.475
Do my parents like my dog
more than they like me?

51:43.558 --> 51:45.393
That's totally valid, Kev.

51:47.145 --> 51:48.855
You're asking the right questions.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.486
How about you, Kit?

51:54.903 --> 51:56.988
Feel like you want to try sharing?

51:58.323 --> 51:59.950
Mmm, no, thank you.

52:00.033 --> 52:00.867
Please.

52:01.618 --> 52:05.330
Kevin just shared
and he feels a lot better. Right, Kev?

52:06.123 --> 52:07.082
Yeah.
So...

52:11.294 --> 52:13.922
-Do you want me to tell the truth?
-Yeah, I mean...

52:14.506 --> 52:15.340
Yeah.

52:15.423 --> 52:18.593
What's-- whatever is really
going on with you.

52:18.677 --> 52:21.888
It's scary. Like, you know,
the canoing was scary, but...

52:21.972 --> 52:24.683
- Mm-hmm.
- After that, just let it flow.

52:24.891 --> 52:26.977
- Yeah, let it go.
- Let it go.

52:30.730 --> 52:31.565
Okay.

52:33.942 --> 52:35.610
Growing up, I never had a pet.

52:35.694 --> 52:38.321
-That's bullshit!
-Totally valid, Spencer.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.574
But it's... it's Kit's share.

52:40.949 --> 52:44.244
And there's only so much time you can
spend talking to your stuffed animals

52:44.327 --> 52:46.621
before you start to want more.

52:48.123 --> 52:49.291
To want love.

52:50.250 --> 52:53.962
But not the regular kind of love
that fades, or changes, or goes away.

52:54.629 --> 52:56.256
That special kind of love.

52:57.340 --> 52:58.508
Unconditional love.

53:01.595 --> 53:02.846
I'm a grown-up now.

53:04.055 --> 53:06.308
And I've made a decision.

53:06.391 --> 53:07.809
Okay.

53:09.936 --> 53:11.479
I'm getting a unicorn.

53:13.857 --> 53:14.774
What?

53:15.609 --> 53:16.818
What? Uh...

53:17.110 --> 53:19.279
I'm getting a pet unicorn.

53:20.447 --> 53:23.950
I guess it's not really a pet,
because unicorns are independent creatures

53:24.034 --> 53:27.454
full of mystery and wonder,
but I'm getting a unicorn friend.

53:27.537 --> 53:28.955
Oh, hell no.

53:30.373 --> 53:31.208
Gene?

53:32.083 --> 53:33.001
Um, Kit...

53:33.084 --> 53:34.836
I don't want you to worry about this,

53:34.920 --> 53:37.714
because this is nothing that you're gonna
have to handle or take care of.

53:37.797 --> 53:39.674
I'm gonna gonna take care of everything.

53:39.758 --> 53:43.178
The unicorn is gonna live quietly
in the backyard with me.

53:43.261 --> 53:45.347
-Quietly?
-Yeah, well...

53:45.430 --> 53:47.891
Gosh, I don't know
if it's really totally quiet.

53:47.974 --> 53:51.603
I didn't really think that much about it
because I'm just really excited.

53:52.938 --> 53:55.482
You both know how much I have wanted this
my entire life,

53:55.565 --> 53:57.734
and it's finally happening, and...

53:57.817 --> 54:01.154
and now that this dream is coming true,
it just makes me think...

54:02.322 --> 54:03.657
what else can happen?

54:05.408 --> 54:06.243
Wow.

54:08.411 --> 54:10.455
Okay, you know, um...

54:12.332 --> 54:13.833
-Maybe...
-Guys, let's...

54:13.917 --> 54:17.212
-Let's take a little moment.
-Yeah.

54:17.295 --> 54:18.380
-Let this all...
-Just...

54:18.463 --> 54:20.882
-You want a family meeting?
- Just a quick one, maybe.

54:20.966 --> 54:24.052
Maybe we'll have a family meeting.
Just, uh, hang in there, guys.

54:24.135 --> 54:25.971
Sit in your truth. Sit in your truth.
Come here.

54:26.054 --> 54:29.516
Honey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

54:30.183 --> 54:31.851
I'm not doing anything.

54:31.935 --> 54:35.397
I specifically came here
to work on our loving family energies.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.483
Kit, do you think
this is some kind of joke?

54:39.401 --> 54:40.610
No, I don't.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.904
I know that you think
that I'm joking, but...

54:43.697 --> 54:45.407
I really am getting a unicorn,

54:45.490 --> 54:48.410
and I'm gonna love it, and it's gonna be
my best friend in the whole world.

54:48.493 --> 54:50.912
Do you want a best friend?
I will be your best friend.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.831
I don't want you to be my best friend.

54:52.914 --> 54:55.583
This whole thing just sounds a lot weirder
than it actually is.

54:55.667 --> 54:57.585
- Want me to be your best friend?
-No.

54:57.669 --> 54:58.545
-Okay.
- This is--

54:58.628 --> 55:00.046
-This is insane!
-Honey.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.716
This is why I never talk to you
about anything.

55:02.799 --> 55:03.758
There's no need to yell.

55:03.842 --> 55:07.304
Yelling is-- is not
an effective way to communicate.

55:07.387 --> 55:08.388
And listen.

55:08.471 --> 55:12.350
We thought you might finally
make a friendship with a person.

55:12.434 --> 55:15.937
We did not know
that we ruined your childhood.

55:16.187 --> 55:17.522
Do you want a puppy?

55:17.605 --> 55:19.816
Should we just get you a puppy?

55:19.899 --> 55:22.277
You know that every one of those kids
was lying?

55:22.360 --> 55:25.030
You sat there so patiently and listened
to all of their stories.

55:25.113 --> 55:27.907
You were falling for every single one
of them. I am your daughter.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.076
-Falling?
-I am telling you the truth.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.371
You know, I'm not mad at you.
I know that I'm just a disappointment.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.123
You are not a disappointment.

55:35.206 --> 55:36.833
You think
you're a disappointment?

55:36.916 --> 55:39.669
Yes. To you, I am a disappointment,
because you're always like,

55:39.753 --> 55:42.422
"Why don't you have a boyfriend?"
"Why don't you eat more vegetables?"

55:42.505 --> 55:43.840
"Why aren't you more like Kevin?"

55:43.923 --> 55:45.717
-Someone call me?
-No!

55:45.800 --> 55:46.843
No, Kev.

55:46.926 --> 55:49.220
We don't want you to be
more like Kevin, all right?

55:49.304 --> 55:51.890
That is not the goal.
We just want you to be happy.
You gotta hand it to Kevin.
He's in the game. He's trying.

55:54.642 --> 55:56.728
-Gene, no, don't go there.
-He's keeping himself busy--

55:56.811 --> 56:00.398
Dad, I am keeping myself just as busy
as Kevin is.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.485
I have a vacuum presentation
that I should be working on right now,

56:03.568 --> 56:05.236
but instead, I've been here with you.

56:05.320 --> 56:09.199
Well, I am sorry
we are not your dream parents.

56:09.616 --> 56:10.575
Okay, honey.

56:11.117 --> 56:11.993
-That's...
-Mom.

56:20.251 --> 56:21.086
Kit.

56:23.338 --> 56:26.424
We know that these kids
are making this stuff up.

56:29.344 --> 56:30.178
You do?
Yeah.

56:34.182 --> 56:35.392
It takes a while and...

56:37.352 --> 56:38.770
sometimes it's...

56:39.437 --> 56:41.064
it's easier than the truth.

56:41.147 --> 56:42.357
Can you understand that?

56:44.150 --> 56:44.984
Mm-hmm.

56:46.486 --> 56:49.739
You know, Britney's father died
of an overdose,

56:51.616 --> 56:55.036
and Karen was abused by a neighbor.

56:55.120 --> 56:58.790
All of these kids, they've got
a pretty sad story

56:58.873 --> 57:02.460
and a pretty good reason
for hiding from who they really are.

57:06.089 --> 57:06.923
Do you?

58:00.518 --> 58:01.352
Oop--

58:06.649 --> 58:08.693
Oh, hello.

58:15.325 --> 58:16.159
Sabrina?

58:17.076 --> 58:17.911
Hey.

58:18.203 --> 58:19.037
I'm good.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.080
I know what I want to do tomorrow.

58:22.207 --> 58:23.750
How much glitter do you have?

59:09.754 --> 59:10.588
Ooh.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.674
You are really late.
Did you bring everything?

59:12.757 --> 59:15.635
I have all the confetti...
Why are you in a costume?

59:15.718 --> 59:17.595
Oh. These are just my clothes.

59:18.179 --> 59:19.347
They're really cool.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.516
-You got this.
-No, you got this!

59:21.599 --> 59:22.850
-We got this.

59:24.644 --> 59:25.937
I gotta take this.

59:26.020 --> 59:26.980
Hello?

59:27.063 --> 59:29.649
<i>How did it go</i>
<i>with your family? Was there hugging?</i>

59:29.732 --> 59:31.359
Uh, there was a Truth Circle.

59:31.442 --> 59:34.571
<i>But you worked it out,</i>
<i>right? 'Cause we have your unicorn!</i>

59:34.654 --> 59:37.031
Oh, my God. Is she there? Where is she?

59:37.115 --> 59:39.617
<i>Oh, not quite yet.</i>
<i>I'm waiting on a 397.</i>

59:39.701 --> 59:40.994
What is that? Is that important?

59:41.077 --> 59:43.538
<i>You do not want</i>
<i>this unicorn entering the country</i>

59:43.621 --> 59:45.123
<i>without a 397.</i>

59:45.206 --> 59:47.292
<i>Now, I'll call you when it gets here.</i>

59:47.375 --> 59:48.918
<i>Then, you come right over.</i>

59:49.002 --> 59:49.836
I will.

59:49.919 --> 59:52.088
This is the happiest day of my life!

59:52.422 --> 59:53.923
<i>So, things are good with your parents?</i>

59:54.007 --> 59:56.551
Yes. Well, I mean, they will be.

59:57.093 --> 59:59.304
They're gonna be really proud
when I get this promotion.

59:59.387 --> 1:00:01.806
<i>Okay, then.</i>
<i>Don't mess it up.</i>

1:00:01.889 --> 1:00:02.724
I won't.

1:00:02.807 --> 1:00:04.350
-You ready?
-Yes.

1:00:04.809 --> 1:00:05.935
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1:00:06.394 --> 1:00:07.604
Show time. Let's go.

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:42.221
And so, in conclusion,

1:00:42.305 --> 1:00:45.141
I give, to all of America, Mystic Vac.

1:00:45.391 --> 1:00:47.602
Cleaning never looked so good.

1:00:48.102 --> 1:00:49.979
What woman wouldn't want
to look like this?

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:52.815
Excellent job, Matt, Aaron.

1:00:52.899 --> 1:00:54.442
I love the model.

1:00:54.901 --> 1:00:57.487
She's sexy, she's aspirational.

1:00:57.570 --> 1:01:00.573
Maybe one day I can look like that
when I vacuum.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.575
You can dream.
I mean, she's really got it all.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.786
-She has the baby but she's also cleaning.
-Hello!

1:01:04.869 --> 1:01:05.787
-And she--
-Hi.

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.080
-And she's--
- Oh.

1:01:07.163 --> 1:01:09.415
- Sorry we're late.
-Hello. What is this?

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:11.334
Are we seeing another presentation?

1:01:11.417 --> 1:01:16.005
This is, uh, Kit, our temp for now,
but maybe in the future--

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:18.841
I didn't realize you'd have
something ready.

1:01:19.759 --> 1:01:20.968
But you told me to.

1:01:21.052 --> 1:01:23.429
I'm intrigued, Gary. I mean...

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:24.889
Look at her clothes.

1:01:25.264 --> 1:01:26.766
Well, if you really want to hear it...

1:01:26.849 --> 1:01:28.559
- Let's hear it.
-Lights!

1:01:35.149 --> 1:01:38.528
Mystic, mystic, vac, vac.

1:01:38.861 --> 1:01:42.365
Mystic, mystic, vac, vac.

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:43.700
Mystic Vac!

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:46.077
It's in the name,

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:49.831
and whoops, it's all over the floor.

1:01:50.623 --> 1:01:53.000
We can clean up all this glitter

1:01:53.376 --> 1:01:55.420
in the colors of our choice--

1:01:55.503 --> 1:01:58.506
in pink, blue, and multi-color.

1:01:59.340 --> 1:02:01.175
Look at them magically vacuum away.

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:10.601
Are these fairies cleaning your house,
or just regular people?

1:02:18.484 --> 1:02:21.237
Behold the whimsical land

1:02:21.696 --> 1:02:24.741
where Mystic Vac vacuums surely are born.

1:02:26.909 --> 1:02:29.412
In your mystical...

1:02:30.371 --> 1:02:31.581
magical...

1:02:32.623 --> 1:02:34.125
dreams!

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:39.672
- Aah!

1:02:40.256 --> 1:02:42.759
Woo! Yeah!

1:02:51.517 --> 1:02:52.351
The end!

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:56.314
Any questions?

1:02:58.524 --> 1:03:00.276
Why are you wearing the vacuum?

1:03:01.819 --> 1:03:04.238
Oh. It's an invention I came up with.

1:03:04.322 --> 1:03:06.282
They're called backpacks.

1:03:07.325 --> 1:03:10.620
Does it read a little childish?

1:03:10.703 --> 1:03:14.207
Uh, the whole magical rainbow-ness
of it all?

1:03:14.707 --> 1:03:15.541
Hmm.

1:03:17.543 --> 1:03:20.505
Well, every person alive has a dream.

1:03:21.088 --> 1:03:25.051
Everybody needs some magic in their lives,
even if they're all grown up.

1:03:26.302 --> 1:03:30.598
So, there wouldn't be a sexy woman
vacuuming a house.

1:03:30.681 --> 1:03:34.352
As I mentioned, Angie,
Kit's just a temp, so...

1:03:34.435 --> 1:03:37.897
Well, this is not a vacuum for your house.

1:03:38.356 --> 1:03:40.191
This is a vacuum for your soul.

1:03:41.859 --> 1:03:42.985
Look around you!

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:47.365
I see my problems,
and they're all over the floor.

1:03:47.824 --> 1:03:49.951
And a little bit on your conference table.

1:03:50.785 --> 1:03:54.747
But I-I really wish that I could
just vacuum them up, you know?

1:03:54.831 --> 1:03:58.417
Especially with a vacuum that has
30% more power than the leading brand.

1:03:58.501 --> 1:04:02.463
So, imagine that these are my problems,

1:04:03.130 --> 1:04:06.259
this is my career and my-- my parents,

1:04:06.342 --> 1:04:07.176
um...

1:04:07.552 --> 1:04:08.845
and-- and, uh...

1:04:09.470 --> 1:04:10.304
and...

1:04:10.972 --> 1:04:11.848
Sabrina?

1:04:12.473 --> 1:04:14.100
What would you like to vacuum up

1:04:14.183 --> 1:04:17.186
in a vacuum that is powerful
and also attractive?

1:04:17.770 --> 1:04:18.604
Uh...

1:04:19.522 --> 1:04:21.274
Just... I'll say my parents, too.

1:04:22.024 --> 1:04:22.859
Um...

1:04:23.234 --> 1:04:24.068
Actually...
Um...

1:04:26.404 --> 1:04:27.572
I'll say fear.

1:04:28.406 --> 1:04:31.325
Because I've always had a dream
where I could open my own Etsy shop,

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:34.245
and I would make jewelry
shaped like little food.

1:04:34.704 --> 1:04:36.414
Right? Um...

1:04:36.873 --> 1:04:38.457
I'm just really scared, so...

1:04:39.917 --> 1:04:41.085
Fear.

1:04:42.128 --> 1:04:43.838
Yep.  Yep.

1:04:44.505 --> 1:04:45.715
Okay, um...

1:04:45.798 --> 1:04:47.758
I wish I could vacuum up all the haters.

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:50.177
You know, because a lot of people think
that I'm not smart

1:04:50.261 --> 1:04:53.264
because I'm a delivery guy
and 'cause I'm kind of hot, but...

1:04:53.973 --> 1:04:55.141
I do crosswords, y'all.

1:04:56.058 --> 1:04:57.393
And I read books, so...

1:04:58.269 --> 1:04:59.395
Yeah, that's good.

1:04:59.478 --> 1:05:00.396
See?

1:05:00.479 --> 1:05:03.065
We're all just looking for happiness.

1:05:04.025 --> 1:05:07.236
And maybe, if we're lucky,
we can just buy it in a store.

1:05:09.530 --> 1:05:10.656
So, what do you think?

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:17.747
I'm really liking the sexy lady vacuuming.

1:05:17.830 --> 1:05:21.542
-You gotta go with the sexy lady.
-I'm just worried about all the rainbows.

1:05:22.168 --> 1:05:24.462
In fact, I'm just realizing right now...

1:05:24.837 --> 1:05:26.881
I-I-I might hate rainbows.

1:05:26.964 --> 1:05:28.633
Oh, my God. Me too. Let's...

1:05:28.716 --> 1:05:30.676
Let's just keep this really real
and grounded.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.595
Wait, but you guys do realize that--

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:34.639
Sorry, rainbows are real.

1:05:35.431 --> 1:05:36.265
So...

1:05:37.141 --> 1:05:38.643
Gary, what about you?

1:05:48.569 --> 1:05:49.695
Talk to me more...

1:05:52.365 --> 1:05:53.699
about the lingerie.

1:06:00.915 --> 1:06:03.709
So you quit or you were fired?

1:06:03.793 --> 1:06:06.504
Mmm... it was a little bit of both.

1:06:06.879 --> 1:06:08.756
-Oh, no.
- But it's okay.

1:06:10.049 --> 1:06:15.554
Because I have other
more meaningful things in my life.

1:06:16.389 --> 1:06:17.223
That--

1:06:17.598 --> 1:06:18.808
-That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:19.892 --> 1:06:22.436
I mean, who's Gary?
He's just like my professor.

1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:24.647
It's these dudes that I just tiptoe around

1:06:24.730 --> 1:06:27.024
because I think that they know
so many things.

1:06:28.067 --> 1:06:28.901
They don't.

1:06:30.027 --> 1:06:30.987
I know things.

1:06:32.113 --> 1:06:34.031
And I have a secret, and it's really good.
Are you gonna tell me
what this secret is or what?

1:06:36.117 --> 1:06:36.951
No.

1:06:37.451 --> 1:06:38.327
Kit!

1:06:39.370 --> 1:06:41.497
-I won't tell you.
- Come on. Tell me, please.

1:06:41.580 --> 1:06:42.832
-No.
- Please.

1:06:42.915 --> 1:06:43.749
No.

1:06:43.833 --> 1:06:44.709
Why?

1:06:44.792 --> 1:06:46.252
Because you're gonna freak out.

1:06:46.335 --> 1:06:48.129
Why would I freak out?
I'm not gonna freak out.

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:51.090
It's not about you. It's about
the other people in this restaurant.

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:52.591
I just can't put that on them.

1:06:54.343 --> 1:06:57.138
Are you gonna have to broadcast?
You can tell me. Tell me in a whisper.

1:06:59.974 --> 1:07:01.892
You promise you're not gonna freak out?

1:07:01.976 --> 1:07:03.936
I swear I will not freak out.

1:07:07.690 --> 1:07:08.566
Okay.

1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:16.991
What would you say...

1:07:17.950 --> 1:07:19.160
if I told you...

1:07:20.244 --> 1:07:24.623
that I'm getting a unicorn?

1:07:26.792 --> 1:07:29.170
I would say you paid too much for a horse.

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:31.297
Okay.

1:07:31.714 --> 1:07:33.591
Okay, but what if I said:

1:07:34.925 --> 1:07:40.598
"No, Virgil,
I really am getting a unicorn."

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:42.516
-I am!

1:07:44.268 --> 1:07:47.480
It's gonna come live in the backyard
in that stable that you're building.

1:07:47.563 --> 1:07:49.857
-Okay, what are you saying?
- Ta-da!

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:51.567
No, no, no. What are you saying?

1:07:52.193 --> 1:07:54.528
What? I'm saying what I'm saying.

1:07:54.945 --> 1:07:57.031
I'm saying that I'm getting a unicorn.

1:07:58.240 --> 1:07:59.075
Hello?

1:07:59.366 --> 1:08:00.826
This is exciting news.

1:08:01.452 --> 1:08:04.872
Okay, I know what you're thinking.
Like, "Meh, unicorns aren't real."

1:08:05.748 --> 1:08:06.707
But they are.

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:08.918
And they'll love you forever.

1:08:09.460 --> 1:08:11.253
Forever.

1:08:14.215 --> 1:08:15.091
Okay.

1:08:17.593 --> 1:08:18.511
Um...

1:08:19.053 --> 1:08:20.596
Where does this unicorn come from?

1:08:20.679 --> 1:08:23.349
-The unicorn store.
-Oh, good. Of course.

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:24.433
I know.

1:08:24.767 --> 1:08:26.977
I know. It's this really weird place

1:08:27.061 --> 1:08:29.063
with this really weird guy,
and I was skeptical too.

1:08:29.146 --> 1:08:31.774
-You guys ready to order?
-I'm sorry. Not even close.

1:08:32.525 --> 1:08:33.526
Um...

1:08:34.151 --> 1:08:35.528
What weird guy?

1:08:36.445 --> 1:08:39.532
The unicorn salesman. He's the one
that gets all the unicorns.

1:08:40.783 --> 1:08:41.617
Kit.
What?

1:08:48.874 --> 1:08:49.708
Don't be scared.

1:08:49.792 --> 1:08:51.293
I wasn't before you said that.

1:08:56.382 --> 1:08:57.591
Is something wrong?

1:08:59.176 --> 1:09:00.302
This isn't right.

1:09:04.890 --> 1:09:06.433
-There are no buttons.
-I know.

1:09:06.767 --> 1:09:07.643
Just wait.

1:09:19.196 --> 1:09:20.447
You have the right floor?

1:09:21.657 --> 1:09:22.533
Yes.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:24.076
But no.

1:09:25.327 --> 1:09:26.245
This isn't it?

1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:28.414
No.

1:09:28.789 --> 1:09:30.708
No, something's not right, because--

1:09:30.791 --> 1:09:33.210
I promise you, I'm not a crazy person.
It was here!

1:09:33.294 --> 1:09:34.920
- Oh, yeah, I believe you.
-You do?

1:09:35.004 --> 1:09:38.090
Sure. Some shady guy tricked you,
took your money, and skipped town.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:41.927
But I didn't give him any money. I just
had to prove that I deserved a unicorn.

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:43.512
Prove it? How? What did you have to do?

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:45.598
Are we in the right building?
This just isn't right.

1:09:45.681 --> 1:09:47.725
-What did you have to do, Kit?
-Nothing. Nothing.

1:09:47.808 --> 1:09:51.478
I had to just build a stable,
prove that I was financially capable.

1:09:51.562 --> 1:09:53.772
You gave a stranger financial information?

1:09:53.856 --> 1:09:55.941
No! It's not like that.

1:09:56.525 --> 1:09:59.904
Look, you were conned. This guy is trying
to steal your identity or something.

1:09:59.987 --> 1:10:02.740
By building an entire unicorn store?

1:10:03.616 --> 1:10:05.201
You should've seen this place.

1:10:05.284 --> 1:10:07.536
There was an ice cream parlor,

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:09.455
and there was this like
giant screen right here,

1:10:09.538 --> 1:10:11.332
and there was a recreational lounge.

1:10:11.415 --> 1:10:12.249
What?

1:10:13.334 --> 1:10:15.628
If I got a girl,
I was gonna name her Zoe.

1:10:16.295 --> 1:10:17.379
Or Beyoncé.

1:10:19.173 --> 1:10:20.507
Those are good names, Kit.

1:10:23.928 --> 1:10:25.012
I'm so stupid.

1:10:25.095 --> 1:10:26.597
No, no.

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.391
You're not. Look, if this guy
has your information,

1:10:29.475 --> 1:10:31.060
let's just call the police.

1:10:33.979 --> 1:10:36.440
So you don't believe
that I'm getting a unicorn.

1:10:37.691 --> 1:10:39.151
I believe that they made you believe.

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:41.570
Look, you don't have to be embarrassed.
He tricked you.

1:10:41.654 --> 1:10:43.447
No. I didn't qualify.

1:10:43.822 --> 1:10:45.866
I didn't qualify
because I fought with my parents.

1:10:45.950 --> 1:10:47.910
We didn't totally make up,
and now, oh, my God,

1:10:47.993 --> 1:10:49.828
they're gonna give the unicorn
to somebody else.

1:10:49.912 --> 1:10:53.249
-You think this is about your parents?
-I don't know. I don't know what I think.

1:10:53.332 --> 1:10:55.376
I think that there's something wrong
with my brain.

1:10:55.459 --> 1:10:56.877
Your brain is fine.

1:10:56.961 --> 1:10:59.255
Oh, I'm glad that you think so,
but whatever you were doing

1:10:59.338 --> 1:11:01.757
out of pity-slash-obligation,
it's obviously over.

1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:04.760
Pity slash obligation? Jesus, Kit.
Give me some credit here.

1:11:04.843 --> 1:11:07.137
Did you ever think
that maybe I actually like you?

1:11:07.221 --> 1:11:09.598
-No, you're confused.
- You're confused.

1:11:09.974 --> 1:11:11.600
Of course I'm confused.

1:11:11.684 --> 1:11:14.061
I thought that I was getting
a real live unicorn.

1:11:14.144 --> 1:11:17.273
Okay, come on, Kit, I like you,
let me help you figure this out, please?

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:19.650
No... you don't like me.

1:11:19.733 --> 1:11:21.986
You don't like anything,
so you're off the hook. Okay?

1:11:22.069 --> 1:11:23.821
You don't get to decide
when I'm off the hook.

1:11:23.904 --> 1:11:25.281
I decide what I'm off the hook!

1:11:25.364 --> 1:11:26.365
Bye, Virgil.

1:12:10.492 --> 1:12:11.577
- Sweetie.

1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:12.870
Okay. All right, okay.

1:12:12.953 --> 1:12:13.787
All right.

1:12:13.871 --> 1:12:15.331
Come-- come sit down, honey.

1:12:17.416 --> 1:12:19.126
Are you cleaning up?

1:12:19.835 --> 1:12:20.919
Growing up.

1:12:22.004 --> 1:12:24.340
I think I understand
why I don't have a boyfriend.

1:12:27.468 --> 1:12:29.303
Well, I got you a s'more.

1:12:29.386 --> 1:12:33.974
Well, it might not be a s'more anymore,
but it was a s'more.

1:12:34.683 --> 1:12:35.809
Kevin made it.

1:12:36.602 --> 1:12:39.229
-I don't want something that Kevin made.
-Okay, well...

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:42.691
Listen, you missed something
I really think you would have liked.

1:12:43.650 --> 1:12:44.485
What?

1:12:44.902 --> 1:12:46.153
He fell in the river.

1:12:46.528 --> 1:12:48.781
Kevin fell in the river
with his life vest on.

1:12:48.864 --> 1:12:50.616
- No!
-Yes.

1:12:50.699 --> 1:12:52.493
-He did?
-Oh, yes.

1:12:52.576 --> 1:12:55.329
And he-- he screamed like a little child.

1:12:58.040 --> 1:12:59.416
- Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:01.168
I would have liked to see that.

1:13:01.251 --> 1:13:02.086
Yeah.

1:13:03.045 --> 1:13:05.964
Mm-hmm. See, I-I know some things
about my daughter.

1:13:10.010 --> 1:13:11.804
I went on a date.

1:13:12.471 --> 1:13:13.305
Oh!
Mm-hmm.

1:13:15.724 --> 1:13:16.809
The carpenter?

1:13:16.892 --> 1:13:17.810
Yeah.

1:13:17.893 --> 1:13:19.645
But he doesn't think that he's one.

1:13:20.938 --> 1:13:21.772
Hmm.

1:13:23.482 --> 1:13:25.818
Well, are you gonna go out again?

1:13:29.321 --> 1:13:30.447
I don't think so.

1:13:32.366 --> 1:13:33.617
I had one of my...

1:13:34.368 --> 1:13:36.412
world-famous temper tantrums.

1:13:36.495 --> 1:13:37.329
Uh-huh.

1:13:40.207 --> 1:13:43.669
So I-I don't think he's going to want
to see me anymore.

1:13:43.752 --> 1:13:46.588
Well, that can't be true.
Look how beautiful you are.

1:13:46.672 --> 1:13:47.548
Mom!

1:13:51.510 --> 1:13:53.887
-All right. I just want to say one thing,

1:13:53.971 --> 1:13:54.805
and...
you know...

1:13:57.516 --> 1:14:00.769
you can just roll your eyes
at my Emotion Quest bullshit.

1:14:00.853 --> 1:14:01.937
-No! No!
-I know.

1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:02.896
-Listen.
-No, Mom.

1:14:02.980 --> 1:14:04.523
I just want to tell you one thing.

1:14:04.606 --> 1:14:07.484
And it's something we tell the kids
all the time. Okay?

1:14:08.986 --> 1:14:12.698
The most grown-up thing you can do
is fail at things you really care about.
Really? Because I'm really good
at messing things up.

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:20.414
See?

1:14:21.123 --> 1:14:22.207
You're a grown-up.

1:14:24.334 --> 1:14:25.669
And I love you.

1:14:27.588 --> 1:14:29.256
-I love you too.
- Mm-hmm.

1:14:35.762 --> 1:14:37.389
And you're gonna be just fine.

1:14:38.765 --> 1:14:39.683
You know that?

1:14:41.143 --> 1:14:44.688
You have the most important thing
in the whole world right-- right here.

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:49.276
Al right, I'm gonna get you some tea.
How about tea, right?

1:14:49.359 --> 1:14:50.819
-Yes.
-With a little honey?

1:14:50.903 --> 1:14:52.196
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:14:59.286 --> 1:15:02.247
Wait, did you just--
Did you just put those up?

1:15:02.331 --> 1:15:03.165
What?
The--

1:15:05.584 --> 1:15:07.461
No. Those have been there for months.

1:15:13.008 --> 1:15:15.511
<i>Hi, it's Virgil.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1:15:16.637 --> 1:15:17.930
Hey, Virgil.

1:15:18.222 --> 1:15:19.932
It's me again.

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:23.477
<i>I know that I screwed up.</i>

1:15:24.645 --> 1:15:27.898
<i>I usually just get in fights</i>
<i>with my Care Bears,</i>

1:15:28.315 --> 1:15:32.236
<i>and I don't really have to worry</i>
<i>about their feelings.</i>

1:15:32.945 --> 1:15:33.820
<i>Um...</i>

1:15:33.904 --> 1:15:37.115
<i>But you're not a Care Bear.</i>

1:15:37.824 --> 1:15:39.660
<i>So, just...</i>

1:15:40.911 --> 1:15:42.162
I'm sorry.

1:15:43.413 --> 1:15:44.331
Again.

1:15:45.749 --> 1:15:46.917
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1:16:00.180 --> 1:16:01.390
Stop judging me.

1:16:15.487 --> 1:16:16.321
Hey.

1:16:20.742 --> 1:16:21.577
Ta-da.

1:16:21.660 --> 1:16:23.453
Virgil!

1:16:27.124 --> 1:16:28.208
Whoa.

1:16:32.170 --> 1:16:33.630
Did you do all of this?

1:16:33.714 --> 1:16:36.717
Well, I mean, you did.

1:16:37.884 --> 1:16:40.554
I just took it out of the trash
and hung it up.

1:16:42.222 --> 1:16:43.515
Your parents helped.

1:16:44.182 --> 1:16:45.434
My parents?

1:16:45.517 --> 1:16:46.351
Yeah.

1:17:04.911 --> 1:17:06.204
I made that.

1:17:07.748 --> 1:17:10.167
I made that in my first art class.

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:16.131
I made that one as a kid.

1:17:17.424 --> 1:17:20.344
It's a two-horned flying unicorn.

1:17:21.303 --> 1:17:22.846
It's my own creation.

1:17:22.929 --> 1:17:24.681
Oh, now I see it.

1:17:24.765 --> 1:17:26.516
And these are my curtains.

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:42.366
This is incredible.

1:17:44.451 --> 1:17:48.205
It's an art show of my life.

1:17:50.999 --> 1:17:51.833
Well...

1:17:52.250 --> 1:17:55.170
If you were a building,
this is what you'd look like.

1:17:57.506 --> 1:18:00.425
That is the nicest thing
a man has ever said to me.

1:18:03.136 --> 1:18:03.970
Well...

1:18:04.721 --> 1:18:06.264
You made me make this.

1:18:06.765 --> 1:18:11.186
And now I can use
a sliding compound miter saw.

1:18:11.269 --> 1:18:13.146
-Not so bad. Not bad.

1:18:14.481 --> 1:18:16.817
Did you quit your job
at the hardware store?

1:18:17.150 --> 1:18:18.568
I went by there yesterday.

1:18:18.902 --> 1:18:20.028
Oh, no, um...

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:21.905
I transferred to another store

1:18:21.988 --> 1:18:23.782
where my extensive saw knowledge

1:18:23.865 --> 1:18:28.704
has granted me the coveted position
of assistant store manager.

1:18:29.413 --> 1:18:30.622
Virgil!

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:31.748
-Hey!
-Look at you!

1:18:31.832 --> 1:18:34.584
-"Virgil."
-Congratulations.

1:18:34.668 --> 1:18:35.585
Thank you.

1:18:36.586 --> 1:18:39.256
-I guess we should celebrate.
-Yeah, we've gotta celebrate!

1:18:39.339 --> 1:18:42.134
-Should we bring chips in here?
-Uh, that sounds good.

1:18:42.217 --> 1:18:44.344
-Bugles?
-Yeah, why not?

1:18:44.428 --> 1:18:45.762
-Pizza?
-Pizza.

1:18:46.096 --> 1:18:47.305
-Absolutely.

1:18:47.556 --> 1:18:49.182
-Oh.

1:18:51.101 --> 1:18:51.935
Um...
It's him.

1:18:54.563 --> 1:18:55.397
Hello?

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.607
<i>Your unicorn is here!</i>

1:18:57.691 --> 1:18:58.734
Are you kidding me?

1:18:59.317 --> 1:19:02.654
Where were you? I went to the store
and you were gone. Everything was gone.

1:19:02.738 --> 1:19:05.657
-Is that the guy? Give me the phone.
-<i>The store is not for him, Kit.</i>

1:19:05.741 --> 1:19:07.659
<i>So he's not gonna see it</i>
<i>if he doesn't believe it.</i>

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:10.370
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
Either you're real or you're not.

1:19:10.454 --> 1:19:12.414
<i>Do you want the unicorn?</i>

1:19:12.706 --> 1:19:14.416
<i>I got a lady on the waiting list.</i>

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:15.584
Um...

1:19:16.501 --> 1:19:17.794
I-I don't believe you anymore.

1:19:17.878 --> 1:19:20.589
<i>I don't care!</i>
<i>I need an answer.</i>

1:19:20.672 --> 1:19:21.506
Really?

1:19:21.965 --> 1:19:23.675
You promise that it's there? Um...

1:19:23.759 --> 1:19:25.719
Kit, Kit, what are you doing?
Hang up the phone.

1:19:25.802 --> 1:19:28.138
- <i>Are you coming or not?</i>
-Um...

1:19:28.847 --> 1:19:29.681
Fine.
<i>-Good.</i>
-I'll be there.

1:19:30.682 --> 1:19:32.809
Please just don't give it away
before I get there.

1:19:32.893 --> 1:19:33.935
-Kit!
-Okay, bye.

1:19:34.019 --> 1:19:37.022
-Are you kidding me?
-I know! I know! I know!

1:19:37.105 --> 1:19:40.358
I'm stupid, but he says
that the unicorn is there,

1:19:40.442 --> 1:19:41.568
it's ready for me.

1:19:41.651 --> 1:19:43.779
The unicorn is ready?
Kit, this guy could be dangerous.

1:19:44.571 --> 1:19:48.492
But he says that there's another woman
who wants it, too.

1:19:48.867 --> 1:19:50.285
And that he's gonna give it to her.

1:19:50.368 --> 1:19:51.995
-Kit!
- He's lying, right?

1:19:52.078 --> 1:19:54.664
-He's probably lying.
- Yes, he is.

1:19:54.748 --> 1:19:57.000
But... I just don't know.

1:19:57.083 --> 1:19:58.043
It's really--

1:19:58.126 --> 1:19:59.878
I'm confused, and...

1:20:01.421 --> 1:20:03.298
I don't want to wonder my whole life.

1:20:24.528 --> 1:20:25.654
What happened here?

1:20:26.029 --> 1:20:27.906
Oh, hello. It's, um...

1:20:28.406 --> 1:20:30.617
We're packing up. Time to relocate.

1:20:31.576 --> 1:20:33.995
Kit, he's waiting for you.

1:20:34.704 --> 1:20:36.122
He's in there?

1:20:36.206 --> 1:20:37.999
Yes! Right through there. Go.

1:20:43.672 --> 1:20:45.257
Okay, but what do I say?

1:20:47.175 --> 1:20:48.134
Figure it out.

1:21:45.609 --> 1:21:47.569
Hi, unicorn.

1:21:49.654 --> 1:21:53.158
Mr. Unicorn, I think. Are you a boy?

1:21:55.619 --> 1:21:58.455
Oh, wow, you are a lot bigger
than I thought.

1:22:11.009 --> 1:22:11.968
Hi.

1:22:13.261 --> 1:22:14.179
I'm Kit.

1:22:16.598 --> 1:22:18.058
I used to dream about you.

1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:21.227
Did you know that?

1:22:23.396 --> 1:22:25.732
I thought that a unicorn
lived in my closet, but...

1:22:27.943 --> 1:22:30.779
I'm starting to realize
that that doesn't make any sense.

1:22:36.826 --> 1:22:39.829
You were my best friend
for a really long time.

1:22:42.248 --> 1:22:43.625
I called you Steve.

1:22:44.250 --> 1:22:45.919
Steve, the Unicorn.

1:22:54.052 --> 1:22:56.888
You would play checkers with me
when no one else would.

1:22:58.306 --> 1:23:01.267
You used to push the piece with your horn,

1:23:01.351 --> 1:23:04.980
and there was one time you got so mad
that you lost that you...

1:23:05.772 --> 1:23:08.483
stabbed a hole in the board.

1:23:09.150 --> 1:23:11.569
We just laughed and laughed,  'cause...

1:23:13.655 --> 1:23:15.156
Because that's really funny.

1:23:16.741 --> 1:23:18.326
I made you a tiny hat.

1:23:21.579 --> 1:23:22.789
Oh, thank you.

1:23:23.915 --> 1:23:25.542
Is it okay that I'm hugging you?

1:23:26.751 --> 1:23:27.585
Thank you.

1:23:29.879 --> 1:23:31.131
Thank you forever.

1:23:36.428 --> 1:23:37.595
I'm okay now.

1:23:39.848 --> 1:23:43.309
The Salesman says that there's a lady
who needs you more than me.

1:23:45.562 --> 1:23:47.188
So you're gonna be her friend.

1:23:49.357 --> 1:23:51.026
You're gonna be her best friend.

1:23:51.985 --> 1:23:54.779
And you're gonna play checkers with her
whenever she wants.

1:23:56.281 --> 1:24:00.952
And don't let her go searching for people
that can't see who she really is.

1:24:02.954 --> 1:24:04.539
You are gonna be there for her.

1:24:07.125 --> 1:24:08.877
You're gonna listen to her secrets.
And she's gonna listen to yours.

1:24:16.134 --> 1:24:17.385
You're gonna love her...

1:24:18.011 --> 1:24:19.554
exactly how she is.

1:24:21.014 --> 1:24:24.976
Even when she thinks that there is nobody
who could love her in the whole world.

1:24:33.151 --> 1:24:33.985
Bye-bye.

1:24:38.490 --> 1:24:42.035
Did you really ride up here
in the elevator?

1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:51.020
Is this the right place?

1:25:52.605 --> 1:25:54.440
I found this letter on my desk.
