WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.785
<i>Previously on
Supergirl...</i>

00:09.444 --> 00:10.967
The Phantom, he's a bloodhound.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.143
If we can get our hands
on more of Kara's DNA...

00:13.187 --> 00:14.710
Then he'll track her
by instinct.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.581
How are we gonna get
more of Kara's DNA?

00:16.625 --> 00:19.889
We can collect DNA
from a Kryptonian
after a solar flare.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.065
<i>This is what my dreams
have been about.</i>

00:22.109 --> 00:25.329
If we wanna bring Kara home,
we have to go back in time...

00:25.373 --> 00:26.591
to Midvale High.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.900
Alex and Nia were right.

00:30.943 --> 00:34.251
Behold, the May 25th, 2009 <i>
Midvale Weekly.</i>

00:34.295 --> 00:35.992
Huh.
-The week
of Midvale High's prom.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.560
The same night
as the Aquarid meteor shower.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.605
This is
where we need to go
to save Supergirl?

00:40.649 --> 00:43.043
Yeah, I was back
from Stanford on vacation.

00:43.086 --> 00:46.089
I just dropped Kara off
at the school assembly hall
for prom,

00:46.133 --> 00:48.004
and, uh, with a jacket.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.399
It was oddly cold that night,
and that's when the shower hit,

00:51.442 --> 00:54.358
and then this giant meteor
just came

00:54.402 --> 00:58.971
bearing down and Kara flew up
and punched it out of the sky.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.582
But the meteor had Kryptonite.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.976
The impact was enough
to destroy the meteor,

01:04.020 --> 01:06.805
but Kara got pretty hurt.
She fell through
the roof of the gym.

01:06.849 --> 01:07.806
No one saw her?

01:07.850 --> 01:09.504
It was under construction,

01:09.547 --> 01:12.942
and when I found her,
her hand was all cut up.

01:12.985 --> 01:16.076
It was the first time
I ever saw her bleed.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.556
How specifically do we get
to this place in time?

01:18.600 --> 01:20.863
Well, based on my survey
of satellite imagery from 2009,

01:20.906 --> 01:22.343
and the trajectory
of the meteor,

01:22.386 --> 01:23.996
I was able to predict
Kara's point of contact.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.476
After running those figures
-through 3
-D modeling,

01:25.520 --> 01:27.435
I produced a rendering
of the debris field,

01:27.478 --> 01:29.567
and by overlaying that
with geologic
radiation emissions

01:29.611 --> 01:32.222
of that same night,
plus, Kara's own
biologic markers,

01:32.266 --> 01:37.009
I was able to pinpoint
the exact location
of Kara's DNA.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.837
The high school's
baseball diamond center field.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.796
Nia and I depart
after I gather my things.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.451
Alex, what's this
business about

01:43.494 --> 01:45.453
"The luckiest town in America?"

01:45.496 --> 01:48.630
When I left for college,
Kara and her boyfriend, Kenny,

01:48.673 --> 01:51.807
appointed themselves
the town's Scooby-Duo.

01:51.850 --> 01:54.636
They were saving cats
from trees

01:54.679 --> 01:57.204
and kids from wells,
that sort of thing,

01:57.247 --> 01:59.771
and the, uh, town
got quite the reputation.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.600
I thought Kenny Li
was killed when
you were in high school.

02:02.644 --> 02:05.821
The sheriff was
running a drug ring,
and he got caught up.

02:05.864 --> 02:08.606
No, that's one
of those old-world,
new-world differences.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.739
In this world,
Kenny never got killed.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.654
That suggests
there could be
other differences.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.046
Maybe I should come with you.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.310
Absolutely not!

02:16.353 --> 02:19.443
As anyone who's seen <i>
Back to the Future</i> knows,
in 2009, you or you,

02:19.487 --> 02:21.097
could both run
into your past selves,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.186
and thereby disrupt
the continuum of space-time.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.667
The only people
who can go on this mission

02:25.710 --> 02:27.625
are Nia and myself.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.065
Okay, fine.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.198
But you're going to my past.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.636
Don't mess it up.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.817
"Don't mess it up."

02:45.861 --> 02:48.298
Does this look
messed up to you?

02:48.342 --> 02:51.214
In 2009, I was 12.

02:51.258 --> 02:54.217
Is this really
what people wore to prom?

02:54.261 --> 02:56.001
Yes, ergo, it is
the perfect disguise

02:56.045 --> 02:58.439
to allow us to chillax
on our mission.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.354
"Chillax" being
a key 2009 phrase,

03:00.397 --> 03:02.312
along with "flossy, totes,"

03:02.356 --> 03:05.533
and of course,
the immortal, "wassup!"

03:05.576 --> 03:07.883
Oh, I forgot about "wassup."

03:07.926 --> 03:09.493
My sister and I said it so much

03:09.537 --> 03:11.408
that our mom
made us write essays

03:11.452 --> 03:14.237
on the etymology of the phrase
to prove how ridiculous it was.

03:16.587 --> 03:17.893
I forgot about that.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.246
Anyway, you're not looking
too chillaxed, Brainy.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.292
-Hmm?
-You're stress eating again.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.644
I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not stress eating. No.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.820
I just...
I never had breakfast.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.475
So, you're not worried at all
that the last time
you time traveled,

03:34.518 --> 03:36.303
you missed the mark
by 15,000 years?

03:37.347 --> 03:38.957
It was 12,000 years.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.570
All right, fine.
Okay, yes, the...

03:42.613 --> 03:45.355
Maybe the memory of my misstep
has compounded my stress,

03:45.399 --> 03:46.748
leading to caloric consumption.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.837
But I don't know
what else to do.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.320
Well, you're with me, and...
we're only going back
a few years.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.451
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

03:54.495 --> 03:57.237
For Supergirl's sake, it can't.

03:58.455 --> 03:59.282
Come on.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.944
Oh, Sprock, I almost forgot.

04:08.987 --> 04:12.426
The most important element
of our disguise.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.471
The ultimate optical illusion.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.606
-Off the dash, please.
-Sorry.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.608
Targeting temporal wormhole

04:20.651 --> 04:22.087
in three...

04:22.653 --> 04:24.829
two, one.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.793
"With its small town charm

04:31.836 --> 04:33.795
and nearly non-existent crime,

04:33.838 --> 04:37.625
Midvale is quickly
becoming a top place to live
in the country."

04:37.668 --> 04:39.279
Wow.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.281
Where was this town
when I lived here full time?

04:41.324 --> 04:44.109
Probably waiting for you
to leave.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.547
Burn!

04:46.590 --> 04:49.506
Midvale College, one,
Stanford, zero.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.074
Oh, uh...

04:52.117 --> 04:53.771
-Shake's ready. I'll be back.
-Okay.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.299
So, Alex,

04:59.342 --> 05:02.171
you still haven't explained
why you put off
going to Europe.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.826
And you still
haven't told Kenny

05:04.869 --> 05:06.958
about National City University.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.047
I haven't decided.

05:09.091 --> 05:13.356
Kara, you just got accepted
to the college of your dreams.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.663
I know Midvale College
is solid, but--

05:15.706 --> 05:20.363
And it's also where
Kenny and I've been planning
to go since last year.

05:20.407 --> 05:24.062
I just... I just need to find
the right time to tell him.

05:24.106 --> 05:27.544
So, you have decided
and haven't told him

05:27.588 --> 05:30.678
-or you haven't decided, and...
-I don't know.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.375
I haven't decided
what I've decided.

05:36.771 --> 05:39.034
<i>Engine malfunction.</i>

05:39.077 --> 05:40.470
<i>Four overheating...</i>

05:41.950 --> 05:43.517
Chocolate shake.
Here you go.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.086
Uh, thanks, but I just realized

05:48.130 --> 05:51.742
-we're late for study group.
-Study group?

05:51.786 --> 05:53.875
Study group. Right. Right.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.922
You guys never do study...
Wait.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.969
Are you sneaking out
to save something?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.753
-No.
-No. What?

06:02.797 --> 06:04.451
You promised me
you'd stop super-ing
when I left.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.540
Now, you're fidgeting
like you do

06:06.583 --> 06:08.933
-when you lie.
-Right.

06:08.977 --> 06:12.894
Fine. We may have been
helping the local authorities
now and then,

06:12.937 --> 06:15.418
but no one knows that it's us.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
"Luckiest town
in America?"

06:17.464 --> 06:19.074
Kara, you're the luck.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.250
At least until you get caught
and you put Mom

06:21.293 --> 06:23.861
and the rest of us in danger.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.995
We'll stop...

06:27.038 --> 06:31.347
after we check out
whatever just crashed
at the baseball field.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.783
-No. No way.
-I can fly there

06:32.827 --> 06:34.306
without anybody seeing me.
Trust me.

06:34.350 --> 06:37.701
You are not flying anywhere.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.094
I'm driving you.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.879
Okay.

06:44.752 --> 06:45.796
What was it?

06:50.235 --> 06:51.715
Mm.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.588
Tell me you can make
a non-fat double latte.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.286
For a place calling itself
"the luckiest town in America,"

06:57.329 --> 07:00.724
it is proving quite unlucky
when it comes to caffeine.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.118
I drove three hours
from Metropolis

07:03.161 --> 07:06.338
to do a story
on this rube-filled wasteland.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.296
I need coffee.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.428
Stat.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.560
-Tick-tock.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.476
Ugh.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.131
Alex was right. It's freezing.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.959
That means that climate change
wasn't real then.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.917
Our time relay box is broken!

07:19.961 --> 07:22.442
-What?
-It'll take days to fix!

07:23.878 --> 07:26.924
Well, then we're in luck.
We're a day early.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.144
Masquerade themed prom?

07:30.798 --> 07:33.975
-Our disguises are useless.
-Brainy, it's okay.

07:34.018 --> 07:37.457
No. We have to fix a component,
replace its missing dysprosium,

07:37.500 --> 07:39.154
and on top of that,
locate new costumes.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.330
Brainy, you can do everything
you're talking about.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.899
We have 24 hours.
All we have to worry about
is not being seen.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.422
Oh, my gosh.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.858
Did you guys
just come out that spaceship?

07:49.077 --> 07:50.382
Kara?

07:53.690 --> 07:55.213
Wassup?

08:04.396 --> 08:05.833
Y... you spoke English?

08:05.876 --> 08:08.009
He said my name.

08:08.052 --> 08:11.578
Are people
from your planet psychic?

08:11.621 --> 08:12.709
-Yes.
-Yeah, exactly.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.537
Yes, we are.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.191
-We're psychic aliens.
-Psychic aliens.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.498
-Mm-hmm. Ah...
-From planet Psycon.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.456
Why are you dressed like that?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.545
-Well... um...
-Uh, well...

08:22.589 --> 08:24.112
When visiting another planet,

08:24.155 --> 08:26.375
we like to dress formally to--

08:26.418 --> 08:28.290
-To show respect.
-To show respect.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.510
But we will be changing--

08:30.553 --> 08:33.556
-We'll be changing.
-...right after
we fix our ship.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.775
Your ship's broken?

08:34.818 --> 08:35.732
-No.
-Yes.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.998
-Can I just have
a minute with, uh, my--
-Just one.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.652
My fellow Psyconian?

08:42.696 --> 08:44.393
-Just...
-Stay frosty.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.699
We'll be one moment.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.617
So, these are the exact people

08:50.660 --> 08:52.183
we are not supposed
to be dealing with.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.751
Yeah, um, but now,
we are dealing with them,

08:54.795 --> 08:56.274
so, we have to figure out how

08:56.318 --> 08:58.233
-to manage the situation.
-Okay.

08:58.276 --> 09:01.628
So, the only management we need
is to get them out of here.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.544
-We need to get out of here.
-What... what are you
talking about?

09:04.587 --> 09:06.458
We have to help them.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.417
You just promised
you'd stop drawing
attention to yourself.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.725
If their ship is broken,
the least we can do
is help fix it.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.249
Even if it means endangering
everyone around you?

09:14.292 --> 09:16.164
To be fair,
they don't seem hostile.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.340
I mean,
look at how they're dressed.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.258
We...

09:25.652 --> 09:28.263
My name is Kara Zor-El.

09:28.306 --> 09:31.309
This is Kenny and this is Alex.

09:31.353 --> 09:34.443
Uh, this is... Brandon...

09:34.486 --> 09:36.706
-and I'm Brenda.
-Yeah.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.187
-We are Brandon and Brenda.
-Yep.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.755
I am an alien, like you,

09:41.798 --> 09:43.495
from the planet Krypton

09:43.539 --> 09:46.498
and I came to Earth
after my planet was destroyed.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.284
I... I want to help you.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.241
-Thank you.
-That's great.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.200
-But--
-Um...

09:52.243 --> 09:54.855
You see, we were also fleeing

09:54.898 --> 09:56.944
-a dying planet like you...
-Mm-hmm.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.555
...and we were
knocked off-course.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.864
We only have one day
to catch up
with our fellow travelers.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.911
So, that leaves us
with much to do
and very little time to do it.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.000
Just tell us what you need.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.048
We need to conceal
the evidence of our arrival,

10:14.091 --> 10:16.006
fix numerous parts,

10:16.050 --> 10:19.793
and lastly, locate
a rare Earth element
called dysprosium.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.272
Dysprosium?

10:21.316 --> 10:22.665
That's one of those
rare Earth elements

10:22.709 --> 10:24.972
that your mom
is studying at work.

10:25.015 --> 10:28.192
There may be a dysprosium geode

10:28.236 --> 10:31.282
in the college's
Rare Earth Exhibit.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.415
She's saying
she can get it, so...

10:34.329 --> 10:36.592
Wait.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.680
<i>It's at
Midvale High. I'm en route.</i>

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
Police?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.684
Heading this way, fast.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.120
You... you can't be found here.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.513
We need to hide the ship.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.428
Oh, uh... we could do <i>
Groundhog Day.</i>

10:47.995 --> 10:49.997
You have go-to plays?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.566
You... you can stay with us.

11:37.609 --> 11:40.177
If she stays with you guys,
he stays with me.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.223
Okay! Okay, let's go.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.528
-Come on.
Here you go, bro.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.704
Thank you.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.882
Um, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

11:48.925 --> 11:52.537
Just, um... chillax.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.582
Ch--

12:03.940 --> 12:05.420
Professor Tork,

12:05.463 --> 12:07.596
I found another Kryptonian
like you asked.

12:07.639 --> 12:11.600
-It's on the
same planet, but...
-But?

12:11.643 --> 12:14.081
Do we really wanna go after it?

12:14.124 --> 12:18.302
I mean, that male in Metropolis
was a lot.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.438
My zoo needs
a new attraction, Mitch,

12:23.481 --> 12:25.396
or we'll go out of business.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.877
And if two Kryptonians
on the same planet

12:27.921 --> 12:29.705
isn't a sign
that I should take one...

12:30.837 --> 12:32.882
then I don't know what is.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.112
I've never
met another alien
that wasn't Kara.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.592
Do you honestly
always dress this formally?

12:47.636 --> 12:48.768
Customarily, it's what we--

12:48.811 --> 12:49.681
Kenny?

12:49.725 --> 12:51.988
Mom. Look, I can explain.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.903
Explain?

12:53.947 --> 12:56.863
Explain why you ran in so fast,

12:56.906 --> 12:58.821
I have to bring
your dinner to you?

12:58.865 --> 13:02.694
Right, um... I was
at a study session with Kara,

13:02.738 --> 13:04.871
but you didn't
have to bring me dinner.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.698
It's no trouble.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.831
Plus, I need to take a break
from doing the store books.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.311
Don't worry about the books.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.834
I'll, uh... I'll get them
done later tonight,

13:11.878 --> 13:13.967
as soon as I finish
my homework.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.446
Thanks, Mom.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.451
-Oh! My--
-No--

13:21.713 --> 13:24.542
Pal, time is of the essence.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.981
Totes. I'll be out of your hair
as soon as I locate
your computer.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.113
Bro, it's right here.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.463
This is your best computer?
You...

13:32.507 --> 13:36.685
It's... Sprock.
I'll make it work.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.731
All right, next,
I need to find access
-to a 3
-D printer.

13:39.775 --> 13:40.863
-A 3
-D printer?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
Yes, just basic. Nothing fancy.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.259
Brandon, I don't know
what you have on Psycon,

13:45.302 --> 13:46.695
-but 3
-D printers
aren't basic here.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.044
Some aerospace companies

13:48.088 --> 13:50.133
-might have them under--
-This is 2009.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.266
Well, yeah.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.702
Still, can't you use your ring
to, you know,
Dumbledore something up?

13:53.745 --> 13:55.878
No. What? No!

13:55.922 --> 13:58.446
It's physically impossible
to create something
out of nothing, Kenny.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.190
Uh...

14:04.974 --> 14:07.847
What if I can
get you a something?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.457
The building blocks
-of 3
-D printing

14:09.500 --> 14:11.981
are an inkjet engine
and ABS plastic.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.591
-Right?
-That's correct.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.680
We have all that stuff
at our school STEM lab.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.292
Plus, on Friday,
no one's really there.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.076
Oh, we could
sneak onto campus early,

14:20.120 --> 14:21.948
and then we'd have
the run of the whole place.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.343
That could work. Well planned.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.390
Uh, glad I could help.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.480
So, will you be eating
all of this?

14:32.523 --> 14:33.350
-Uh...
-Thank you.

14:41.141 --> 14:44.057
-Thanks for this.
-It's nothing.

14:44.100 --> 14:47.538
You said that you and Brandon
were fleeing a dying planet.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.193
Does that mean

14:50.237 --> 14:53.544
-your family, are they...
-Um...

14:53.588 --> 14:57.984
My father was able to escape,

14:58.027 --> 15:01.857
but my sister and I
don't really talk, and, um...

15:03.641 --> 15:06.253
my mother passed away
before we had to flee.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.952
I'm sorry.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.562
I lost my mom, too.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.611
But... this

15:16.654 --> 15:17.960
was hers.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.311
It's from Krypton.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.534
I still remember
what it was like there.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.318
I still remember her.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.932
I love my Earth family,

15:32.975 --> 15:37.545
but it's not the same
as being with people
who really understand you.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.982
I know what you mean.

15:40.026 --> 15:43.464
My powers are passed down
from mother to daughter,

15:43.507 --> 15:47.816
but my mom died before
she could teach me
how to use them.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.993
I've been doing my best
without her guidance...

15:52.603 --> 15:54.170
but I am struggling.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.348
You won't always feel that way.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.742
It gets better.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.049
Sometimes, I think

16:03.092 --> 16:08.097
that if I could just call her,

16:08.141 --> 16:11.535
and hear her voice,
I might be able to find

16:11.579 --> 16:13.755
the confidence to keep going.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.674
So, what can your powers do?

16:19.717 --> 16:23.330
I mean,
beyond letting you be psychic
and move the Earth?

16:24.853 --> 16:28.988
I can conjure these bubbles

16:29.031 --> 16:31.903
that are just about
as strong as anything.

16:36.778 --> 16:37.997
Cool.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.129
I can do this.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.676
What are you doing?

17:06.721 --> 17:08.462
Uh...

17:08.505 --> 17:10.116
-Showing each other
what we can do.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.422
Well, neither of you
are doing that tomorrow.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.381
Kenny just texted.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.818
He and Brandon
are gonna be working
on fixing that box thing,

17:16.861 --> 17:19.081
so, while he's doing that,
we're using Mom's ID

17:19.125 --> 17:23.042
to slip into the college,
where we can get as much
dysprosium as we can.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.521
Then we part ways.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.915
I understand.

17:26.958 --> 17:30.136
You're all taking
a big risk helping us.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.529
I promise we'll be gone
as soon as we can.

17:32.573 --> 17:33.748
Thank you.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.447
Get some sleep.

17:47.457 --> 17:50.199
Alex can be a control freak,

17:50.243 --> 17:53.420
but you get used to it.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.812
I'm sure I will.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.571
Hello?

18:35.636 --> 18:36.593
Brenda.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.117
You're dressed!

18:38.160 --> 18:39.596
Um... uh...

18:39.640 --> 18:41.424
Is it go time?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.644
You and I just need to be back
before my mom
heads out for work.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.167
Let's go.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.429
Come on.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.740
No one should
bother you so long as
you keep the lights off.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.090
Not to worry.
I once assembled
something similar

18:55.134 --> 18:58.224
on the planet Neuron,
which orbits a black hole,

18:58.267 --> 19:01.140
so, talk about, uh...
talk about dark.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.491
This shouldn't be a problem.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.668
That must be so cool,
having adventures like that.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.235
It's so cool, man.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.498
That's... that's what
I want to do, actually.

19:11.541 --> 19:15.502
I mean, not, like,
be in space all the time,

19:15.545 --> 19:17.765
but to go around with Kara,
helping people.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.985
She and I
are staying local for college
to... to get better at it.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.510
In fact, I, uh...
I just made us a base.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.033
-Base?
-Here on Earth,

19:25.076 --> 19:27.688
we have this alien hero
named Superman.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.994
He lives in this secret bunker.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.996
Oh.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.259
Sounds ingenious.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.608
Yeah, Kara
kinda looks up to him.

19:35.348 --> 19:36.958
I see.

19:37.001 --> 19:40.222
So, uh, you built yourself
a bunker-in-training.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.834
I'm gonna show it to her
after graduation.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.446
I really, really hope
she likes it.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.188
Of course, she will.

19:49.231 --> 19:52.103
There's nothing women like more
than physics well applied.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.715
That and a modicum
of emotional vulnerability.

19:54.758 --> 19:58.109
When I'm with Kara,
I feel like... like
I could do anything.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.546
Well...

19:59.589 --> 20:01.809
It appears your positivity
is catchy.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.247
Nice.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.814
Oh, uh...

20:06.857 --> 20:08.207
-Well, I gotta get to my, um...
-Ah, not to fear.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.686
I shall stay here
for the remaining minutes

20:09.730 --> 20:11.340
to complete fabrication.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.604
I don't know, man.
With that print rate,

20:14.648 --> 20:16.737
your fab looks like
it's gonna take
remaining hours.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.956
But, um... don't worry.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.306
I'll be back for lunch.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.266
Just don't open the door.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.789
Or anything like that.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.757
No, Perry, I don't have
anything to send yet,

20:36.800 --> 20:41.109
because I've been here
less than 24 hours.

20:41.152 --> 20:44.678
Yes, I am aware this is
outside the purview
of my gossip column,

20:44.721 --> 20:48.769
but as discussed,
I want to do real news.

20:48.812 --> 20:53.077
Based on my research,
I believe there is
some superbeing

20:53.121 --> 20:55.950
behind the so-called miracles
in this town.

20:55.993 --> 20:59.170
I'm going to find this being,
name them, and then,

20:59.214 --> 21:01.347
do a story on them
that will blow Lois Lane

21:01.390 --> 21:04.001
into the classified section.

21:04.045 --> 21:07.178
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have an interview...

21:09.659 --> 21:11.922
as soon as I find
someone to talk to.

21:23.151 --> 21:26.067
Excuse me, Professor Danvers.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.156
CJ Grant, <i>Daily Planet.</i>

21:28.199 --> 21:32.029
I'm looking into
some of the events
that have inspired this place

21:32.073 --> 21:34.728
to be named
"the luckiest town in America."

21:34.771 --> 21:38.253
Apparently, six months ago,
one of these phenomenons
happened here.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.907
Oh?

21:39.950 --> 21:42.649
Yes, nearby construction
caused this column to dislodge

21:42.692 --> 21:45.304
and nearly crash
onto a group of students.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.218
But before it could,

21:47.262 --> 21:50.004
the column seemingly
flew back into place,
saving everyone.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.093
Wow. Wow.

21:52.136 --> 21:55.096
-Wow, that is amazing.
-Mm-hmm.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.667
Well, that's the legend.
What I want is the truth.

22:00.710 --> 22:04.801
As a professor, Dr. Danvers,
you must have heard something.

22:04.845 --> 22:07.108
Your students
can chime in, too.

22:07.151 --> 22:12.461
Oh. Oh, actually, um,
my students have just a big,
big project to get to.

22:16.552 --> 22:20.774
Still, still,
I can say a few words.

22:20.817 --> 22:24.343
Uh, I believe that we need
to look at the facts,

22:24.386 --> 22:29.130
and the facts here,
suggest that nothing in Midvale

22:29.173 --> 22:30.087
is worth finding.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.004
Absolutely nothing.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.225
Mm.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.438
Every time I try to use
one of these things...

23:17.134 --> 23:20.224
Come on.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.052
Come on!

23:22.096 --> 23:25.578
That is perfect.

23:25.621 --> 23:29.451
You are the tenor
our Glee Club needs! Oh!

23:29.495 --> 23:31.888
Come with me, now.

23:31.932 --> 23:36.589
Unless there is another class
that I can escort you to?

23:38.634 --> 23:39.940
Sprock.

23:59.873 --> 24:00.787
There it is.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.488
-It's locked.
-Here.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.034
Brandon!

24:31.078 --> 24:33.210
-Kenny.
-Brandon!

24:34.385 --> 24:36.518
Dude! Wha--

24:36.562 --> 24:39.260
-What's up, my dude?
-Where have you been?

24:39.303 --> 24:41.654
I have been searching for you.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.830
I thought we were
keeping a low profile.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.309
Key events sidelined that goal.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.444
I left our STEM lab
in search of sustenance

24:49.488 --> 24:52.229
and immediately got conscripted
by a Glee Club Spartan chief.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.971
Needing to preserve
my student cover, I agreed.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.060
But that led me
to getting recruited
by your math league,

24:57.104 --> 25:00.499
drama guild and...
Coach Kripkey...

25:00.542 --> 25:02.762
who's desperately in need
of someone who can switch hit.

25:02.805 --> 25:06.417
Wow, that is a lot of exposure.

25:06.461 --> 25:09.551
Yes and, given my status,
a risky venture, but necessary

25:09.595 --> 25:11.858
in order to avoid
unwanted attention,

25:11.901 --> 25:15.209
or worse, a.m. detention
with Mrs. Gormley.

25:15.252 --> 25:17.907
But still, I have to say,
it has been a revelation.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.605
Are you familiar
with the emotion of stress?

25:19.648 --> 25:22.129
I'm... I'm kind of feeling it
right now.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.392
Well, I have been
struggling with the emotion,

25:24.435 --> 25:26.437
and yet, I have been
under the impression

25:26.481 --> 25:28.875
that my only options
were to stress eat
or not to stress eat.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.180
But now, thanks to your school,

25:30.224 --> 25:32.226
I see a cornucopia
of approaches.

25:32.269 --> 25:36.143
Math leaguers factor,
drama clubbers soliloquize,

25:36.186 --> 25:38.275
and baseballers hit.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.714
Dude, that is fantastic.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.498
But now that
you've seen all that,

25:43.542 --> 25:46.370
do you, uh... do you maybe
want to get out of here?

25:46.414 --> 25:49.722
Because if Alex finds out,
she's going to flip.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.637
True.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.902
Okay. But how do I exfiltrate?
I am a vassal of Coach Kripkey.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.644
You just say
you're not feeling well
and you got to go to the nurse.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.342
Oh. Okay, yes.

26:01.385 --> 26:05.259
Another method
of coping chicanery.
Yes, I love it.

26:05.302 --> 26:08.741
-Okay, okay. I will do it...
-Good.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.917
...after one more line drive.

26:15.922 --> 26:20.448
So... the reporter
didn't say anything
about me specifically?

26:20.491 --> 26:23.756
No, but she gave me a feeling
like she believed me,

26:23.799 --> 26:26.106
but if we make a misstep,
she's gonna pounce
faster than--

26:29.370 --> 26:31.328
That guy almost killed us!

26:31.372 --> 26:33.287
Yeah, and his truck
is full of gas.
Who drives like that?

26:41.164 --> 26:43.166
No one.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.733
In that truck,
no one's at the wheel.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.700
Hey, maybe you should
slow down the truck, boss.

26:54.743 --> 26:58.312
This is how
you get a Kryptonian
to reveal themselves.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.619
Simply set the stage
for disaster,

27:00.662 --> 27:02.838
and they can't help
but try and stop it.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.369
We'll never
catch up to that truck.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.028
I've got it.
Kara, no!

27:32.607 --> 27:34.304
Where am I?

27:39.179 --> 27:42.399
There's got to be some story
in this backwater.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.676
Oh, the...
the brakes don't work.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.634
Gear shift, either.

28:03.464 --> 28:06.423
There's a bus straight ahead.
We have to stop this now!

28:08.208 --> 28:11.472
The wheels.
Use your freeze breath
on the back axle.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.438
<i>Ship's altitude
moving to 500 feet.</i>

28:22.918 --> 28:24.354
Species confirmed.

28:24.398 --> 28:28.663
We have a Kryptonian
and a Naltorian.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.925
Excellent.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.754
Stay the course!

28:32.798 --> 28:35.452
Gun blast in five, four...

28:45.898 --> 28:47.377
What the hell was that?

28:47.421 --> 28:50.467
You didn't stay the course!
Circle around!

28:52.339 --> 28:55.298
Oh, no!
We have another problem.
A Coluan has flown in!

28:59.738 --> 29:01.261
Alex called
about a runaway truck?

29:01.304 --> 29:03.524
It was gonna hit a bus.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.526
Ah, I see.
There was also a blast
that came from overhead.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.441
I think someone's
using a cloaking device.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.791
I'll see what I can dream
while you both scan the sky.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.327
<i>Brenda... Brenda!</i>

29:24.371 --> 29:26.242
Brenda,
I found something.

29:26.286 --> 29:27.678
-There.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.073
There, I've got a lock.

29:31.117 --> 29:33.597
The Coluan scanner has us!

29:33.641 --> 29:36.035
Sir, we need to retreat!

29:37.906 --> 29:38.994
Damn it, Mitch!

29:43.172 --> 29:44.217
They're gone.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.178
Guys, time to go.
That reporter's
right behind me.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.851
Luckiest town, my ass.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.682
Think!

30:16.292 --> 30:17.859
Right.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.603
<i>Systems back online.</i>

30:22.646 --> 30:26.520
Cougar in a cage,
which obviously symbolizes...

30:52.589 --> 30:54.722
<i>Hi.
You've reached Isabel Nal.</i>

30:54.765 --> 30:57.203
-Mom. <i>
-I'm so sorry
I missed your call.</i>

30:57.246 --> 30:59.945
<i>Knowing me, I'm either
in the garden or the studio,</i>

30:59.988 --> 31:02.295
<i>so, don't take it personally,</i>

31:02.338 --> 31:05.646
<i>but please leave a message
and I'll be sure
to get back to you.</i>

31:05.689 --> 31:07.039
<i>Have a great day.</i>

31:17.049 --> 31:18.354
I'm sorry.
We're telling Mom.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.790
Alex,
wait, please.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.270
You can't tell Eliza.
I can fix this.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.229
-I swear.
-Fix this?

31:23.272 --> 31:26.145
In less than 24 hours,
we have had
two alien encounters,

31:26.188 --> 31:28.190
one of which was the impetus
for a break-in

31:28.234 --> 31:31.019
at our mother's place of work,
which, if we get found out,

31:31.063 --> 31:33.152
will likely be
her ex-place of work.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.197
Oh, oh, and let's not forget
about the reporter

31:35.241 --> 31:38.679
who is determined to expose
the luckiest town in America

31:38.722 --> 31:40.681
as home of the newest
alien superhero.

31:40.724 --> 31:44.163
So, tell me, Kara,
how will you fix this?

31:46.992 --> 31:49.951
Well, who reads
the newspaper anymore?

31:51.518 --> 31:53.650
This is too much for us
to handle on our own.

31:53.694 --> 31:56.044
We need help and weapons.
Lots of them.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.959
-Alex, please!
-We need to tell Mom.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.048
Maybe she can get ahold
of someone at the DEO.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.441
Okay. Okay.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.269
You've been at college
for two years,

32:03.312 --> 32:05.097
and now,
you have all the answers?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.621
No, I've seen
what the real world is like.

32:07.664 --> 32:11.625
And it's not risking the truth
of your identity to stop
runaway trucks.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.975
It's about being responsible.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.673
It's about making sacrifices
to ensure the best future

32:16.717 --> 32:18.980
for yourself
and those you care about.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.201
You...

32:22.244 --> 32:23.942
You're saying
you've had to sacrifice for me?

32:23.985 --> 32:25.291
We all have.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.815
Mom sacrificed
her career for you.

32:27.858 --> 32:30.644
Dad sacrificed his life.

32:30.687 --> 32:33.734
You wanna know
why I skipped out
on going to Europe this year?

32:33.777 --> 32:38.217
The one thing I wanted
just for me, gone,

32:38.260 --> 32:39.914
because Mom
was worried about you.

32:41.307 --> 32:43.874
And, as always, here I am.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.229
Your powers...

32:51.665 --> 32:54.755
they don't give you
carte blanche.

32:54.798 --> 32:58.672
Maybe if you had
more life experience,
you'd be able to see that.

32:58.715 --> 33:02.328
I have seen more solar systems
that you have dates,

33:02.371 --> 33:05.157
so don't even.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.333
If you're so mature,
then why haven't you told Kenny

33:07.376 --> 33:08.899
about college
with him next year?

33:13.078 --> 33:14.035
Where are you going?

33:15.732 --> 33:17.212
To show you
how mature I really am.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.523
I think I have
a lead on our attacker.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.091
Is that the DEO database?

33:26.134 --> 33:28.180
Future database, technically.

33:28.223 --> 33:31.009
My <i>Legion</i> scanner
detected a rare
Bismolian energy signature

33:31.052 --> 33:32.488
directly above that fuel truck.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.055
Given the hostile nature
of the gambit,

33:34.099 --> 33:35.709
I deduced
that these alien species

33:35.752 --> 33:37.667
likely had a run-in
with the DEO at some point.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.627
Accessing past information
about our present situation

33:40.670 --> 33:43.760
-using future technology. Fun.

33:43.804 --> 33:46.198
Two aliens manned
Bismolian ships
during this time.

33:46.241 --> 33:49.636
One, an herbalist
named Saphrex Col
from Lasma.

33:49.679 --> 33:53.596
Peaceful race, vegetarians.
The other, a Naxim Tork.

33:53.640 --> 33:57.165
Home planet, unknown,
runs a cosmic menagerie.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.167
Like a zoo?

33:59.211 --> 34:01.387
Full of alien creatures,
possibly even oddly colored.

34:01.430 --> 34:04.303
That's what the cougar
in my dreams is about.

34:04.346 --> 34:07.958
Naxim Tork. That's our guy.

34:08.002 --> 34:12.311
And look, it says the DEO
captured him in Uruguay
three days from now.

34:12.354 --> 34:13.442
That's why
we lose track of him.

34:13.486 --> 34:14.791
He takes off to South America.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.273
-What?
-Brainy, what just happened?

34:18.317 --> 34:21.885
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Brainy, what just happened?

34:21.929 --> 34:25.324
Our actions
in this past, they...

34:25.367 --> 34:28.283
they just changed
the space-time continuum.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.420
Where is that blue light?

34:48.477 --> 34:49.348
Mm.

34:50.305 --> 34:52.351
This is palatable.

34:52.394 --> 34:55.136
I feel like that might be
a compliment, coming from you.

34:56.659 --> 34:57.834
Mm.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.358
-You're a photographer?
-No.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.142
But I do love a dark room.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.971
I'm a journalist, actually.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.842
Here on a big story.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.584
You may know my work
from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

35:08.628 --> 35:10.543
-I am--
-Lois Lane.

35:13.937 --> 35:14.851
Thirsty.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.421
Better get rid of that smudge
on your lens.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.988
Don't want to miss
your next scoop.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.737
That's not a smudge,
that's a shadow...

35:31.868 --> 35:33.566
of a spaceship.

35:36.525 --> 35:37.700
Sorry!

35:46.100 --> 35:48.711
Hey, kid. Wanna make 20 bucks?

35:56.371 --> 35:59.331
Alex is still upset
about the super-ing, isn't she?

35:59.374 --> 36:01.028
-I feel responsible.
-No.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.857
No, don't.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.904
I love doing that with you.
I don't ever
want that to change.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.518
You know that, right?

36:12.561 --> 36:17.218
Alex thinks
she's looking out for me,
for my future,

36:17.262 --> 36:22.049
but... really,
she's just trying
to control it,

36:22.092 --> 36:24.051
and... and she doesn't
need to control it

36:24.094 --> 36:26.096
because I know
exactly what I'm doing...

36:28.577 --> 36:29.839
what I need to do.

36:32.407 --> 36:33.974
That's old man Watson's barn.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.236
What are we doing?

36:37.151 --> 36:38.239
You'll see.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.762
Come on.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.771
I was going to wait
until after graduation
to give you this...

36:50.164 --> 36:52.253
but I know
you've been stressed,

36:52.297 --> 36:54.386
and, uh, I thought
you could use a pick me up.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.910
Welcome to our new
hero-ing base.

36:56.953 --> 36:57.780
Oh...

36:58.999 --> 37:00.130
Kenny.

37:05.658 --> 37:06.963
<i>All scans for Naxim
are inconclusive.</i>

37:07.007 --> 37:09.139
If we don't find
this Naxim Tork,

37:09.183 --> 37:12.186
we will have torn
the fabric of space and time,

37:12.230 --> 37:14.406
which could rewrite
the victors of wars,

37:14.449 --> 37:19.585
create anomalies
where none existed,
erase entire existences!

37:19.628 --> 37:21.804
Alex hasn't been able
to get ahold of Kara.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.937
This is all my fault.
If I had just been able
to interpret my dream,

37:23.980 --> 37:25.852
we would have been able
to catch this guy.

37:25.895 --> 37:28.594
-I should have just
kept trying my mom.
-Kept trying who?

37:32.162 --> 37:34.948
My mom. I called her.

37:34.991 --> 37:38.865
Nia... How could you? Why--

37:38.908 --> 37:41.476
Because I can't
interpret my dreams
and I need help.

37:44.914 --> 37:47.352
I didn't talk to her. I just...

37:47.395 --> 37:50.311
I just needed to hear her voice
and feel close to her.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.444
So, I listened to her voicemail
and that's it.

37:52.487 --> 37:53.967
Around the rugged rock,
the ragged rascal ran.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.751
Around the rugged rock,

37:55.795 --> 37:56.491
-the ragged rascal ran.
Around the rugged--
-Brainy?

37:59.407 --> 38:01.148
Around the rugged rock,
the ragged rascal ran.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.584
Brainy, what are you doing?

38:02.628 --> 38:03.759
I'm coping.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.896
High school, Nia,
with its many species
and subcultures,

38:09.939 --> 38:11.637
each with its own tactics
of stress mitigation.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.769
Now I thought that
given the extreme
circumstances,

38:13.813 --> 38:16.206
that employing
all the coping mechanisms
I learned today would help.

38:16.250 --> 38:19.209
But disappointingly,
they remain ineffective!

38:21.386 --> 38:24.476
I'm sorry, you, uh...
you... you partook

38:24.519 --> 38:27.522
in-in-in some, uh,
high school experience,
yes? Yeah?

38:27.566 --> 38:30.133
Hmm? What-what-what subculture
did you adhere to?

38:30.177 --> 38:31.831
I don't know.
I mostly tried
to keep to myself.

38:31.874 --> 38:35.487
Please just... How did...
How did you cope?

38:38.881 --> 38:40.361
I would sing my favorite song.

38:42.537 --> 38:46.324
It's corny, but it made me feel
like I could do anything.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.849

<i>Naxim Tork's location
has been found.</i>

39:34.502 --> 39:35.416
Naxim's ship.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.070
You okay?

39:38.724 --> 39:39.986
Let's go.

39:44.860 --> 39:45.774
Come here.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.126
Do you know what this is?

39:55.175 --> 39:57.569
It's the log
where we had our first kiss.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.442
It's where
you changed my life, Kara.

40:03.618 --> 40:04.619
This?

40:05.794 --> 40:07.100
This is our future.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.276
Our fortress.

40:10.756 --> 40:13.585
So, uh... what did you
want to talk about?

40:26.946 --> 40:28.730
Nia, I'm sorry
about my behavior earlier.

40:28.774 --> 40:31.298
I should have been
more sensitive
about your mother.

40:31.341 --> 40:33.256
I should have been
more cognizant
that being in a time

40:33.300 --> 40:35.345
when your mother was alive
would conjure up feelings--

40:35.389 --> 40:39.088
Brainy, I'm fine. It's okay.

40:39.132 --> 40:40.525
Let's just catch the bad guys.

40:45.965 --> 40:49.534
I don't understand.
Naxim Tork's ship
should be right here...

40:51.013 --> 40:52.014
...but something's
jamming my scanner.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.891
Well, I wouldn't be
a very good hunter

40:58.934 --> 41:01.546
if the prey could
just see me, now, would I?

41:01.589 --> 41:04.505
Consider hunting season
over, pal.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.160
Well done, Professor.

41:08.553 --> 41:11.033
I love it
when the animals talk back.

41:11.077 --> 41:14.080
-It's one of the things I love
about this job, Mitch.

41:14.123 --> 41:17.475
You just never know
what's going to happen next.
