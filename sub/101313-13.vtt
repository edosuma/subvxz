WEBVTT

00:14.472 --> 00:16.599
[Linda] That's pretty cool, Maze.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.643
You're growing a soul.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.478
Amazing. [chuckles]

00:20.562 --> 00:23.273
And God told you. Wow.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.442
[Mazikeen on phone]
Well, he didn't "tell" tell me.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.988
I was complaining that a demon can't
grow a soul, and God said, "Can't she?"

00:30.071 --> 00:31.364
Annoyingly vague, I know,

00:31.448 --> 00:35.577
but there was this glint
in his eye, and I just knew.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.662
I had no idea
growing a soul was an option.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.874
I mean, I was looking for one
like it was a thing I could eat, maybe,

00:40.957 --> 00:43.710
or a shimmery cloud
that you could breathe in or something,

00:43.793 --> 00:49.424
but, nope, I grew it inside my body,
like a little soul baby.

00:49.507 --> 00:52.969
Well, having seen a glimpse
into how Lucifer's father works,

00:53.053 --> 00:55.930
I guess it… It makes sense, right?

00:56.014 --> 00:59.559
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, right, yeah,
that self-actualization bullshit.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.479
But now my question is,
am I done growing it?

01:02.562 --> 01:05.398
-[tires screech]
-[engine revving]

01:06.649 --> 01:08.818
Uh, Linda, are you listening?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.945
Uh, yes, Maze, of course.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.906
So, do you feel done?

01:12.989 --> 01:15.325
God, therapists…

01:15.408 --> 01:18.453
Does everyone answer questions
with other questions?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.580
-[tires screech]
-[horns honk]

01:20.663 --> 01:22.707
-What was that?
-Nothing.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.769
Hey, I can't talk right now.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.813
-You're doing it, aren't you?
-What?

01:44.896 --> 01:47.148
Don't even think about lying to me, Linda.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.777
I told you this was a mistake.
You are going to get hurt.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.571
-I know what I'm doing.
-[phone beeps]

02:13.800 --> 02:17.554
Just raise up the tip.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.182
Ahh.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.393
Hello, sailor.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.603
What on earth are you doing?

02:27.105 --> 02:30.233
Enough with these
silly distractions, Lucy.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.985
Excuse me!

02:32.068 --> 02:35.864
The impossible bottle is a time-honored
craft of which I was recently reminded.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.033
Mm-hmm. And what about
the prank you pulled on poor Dan?

02:39.117 --> 02:41.161
Very important business.

02:41.244 --> 02:46.207
It took weeks to plan,
and, uh, now that it's over,

02:46.291 --> 02:48.293
I think I'm gonna learn the French horn.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.129
Been meaning to do that. [plays off-key]

02:51.212 --> 02:54.048
Lucy. Lu-- Lucifer!

02:55.258 --> 02:57.093
We need to discuss Father.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.890
God might be retiring, Lucy. God.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.933
We need to figure out
what to do if he does.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.351
Oh, that.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.689
Well, if I have been avoiding something,
it's certainly not that.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.443
Don't get your feathers in a twist.
There's nothing to figure out.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.863
So Dad's retiring.
He's had quite a run, if you ask me.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.698
The world can't be without a God.

03:18.781 --> 03:19.699
You're right.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.160
Somebody will replace him.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.704
And by somebody, I mean you.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.458
-Me?
-Don't play coy, brother.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.003
You've been training for this
since you were in angel nappies.

03:32.086 --> 03:35.298
God's right hand, the greatest warrior,

03:35.381 --> 03:36.758
his bloody favorite son.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.676
Well, you're not wrong there.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.721
You have wanted this your whole life.

03:41.804 --> 03:42.889
I've never said that.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.308
You don't need to say it, brother.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.685
Words are just words.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.438
I know how you feel. [scoffs]

03:53.191 --> 03:55.360
Honey-lemon whiskey sour? [chuckles]

03:55.443 --> 03:59.405
I took a mixology course the other day.
Variety is the spice of life, you know.

04:01.115 --> 04:01.950
Lucifer.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.371
Being God isn't simple.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.373
It's…

04:09.457 --> 04:10.625
It's a big job.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.502
The biggest.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.588
How would I even
go about making that decision?

04:15.672 --> 04:19.926
Well, in situations like these
when much is at stake,

04:20.009 --> 04:23.471
I like to ask myself,
"What's your knee-jerk reaction?"

04:23.554 --> 04:25.848
"You obviously want this,
so leap before you look."

04:25.932 --> 04:29.018
Maybe that's how you used to act,
but, dear brother, you've changed.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.813
Don't pretend otherwise. It's the therapy.

04:31.896 --> 04:35.441
Linda has really
helped you to be more mindful,

04:35.525 --> 04:37.819
to really think things through.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.155
How dare you!

04:41.823 --> 04:42.991
But maybe you're right.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.159
Therapy has ruined me!

04:45.243 --> 04:49.914
I've been overthinking all of my decisions
when really, the answer is at our feet!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.374
"Just do it." [chuckles]

04:51.457 --> 04:55.295
Well, not my feet. I'm clearly
a Louboutin man, but you know what I mean.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
Thank you, brother. [laughs]

05:04.262 --> 05:07.223
-[sniffles] Okay.
-[horn blows]

05:07.307 --> 05:10.059
[chuckles] Sorry.
It's just, my French horn.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.853
I'm just on my way to chuck it out.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.022
What are you doing here?

05:14.105 --> 05:17.317
I need to talk about us. I…

05:18.026 --> 05:21.029
I know that I said I could wait
until you figured things out,

05:21.112 --> 05:24.490
but now I realize
that I might not be able to.

05:25.616 --> 05:29.579
This whole relationship limbo,
it's really hard, you know?

05:29.662 --> 05:33.333
And it's now affecting other people,
like Trixie, for one.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.585
And, you know, you are immortal,

05:35.668 --> 05:41.090
so that means that I could be waiting
for a very long time. Like, forever.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.676
But my point is, is that I can't wait,

05:43.760 --> 05:48.014
and it's not because
you didn't say, you know, those words,

05:48.097 --> 05:50.600
'cause, look, words are just words.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.228
And I think I know how you feel,

05:54.896 --> 05:55.938
but I--

05:56.022 --> 05:58.316
Right now, I just-- I need to know. I…

05:59.984 --> 06:03.321
One way or another,
I need to know if we're together.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.198
That's it.

06:08.659 --> 06:09.494
Yes.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.289
-Yes?
-Yes.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.376
-Let's just do it.
-What?

06:16.459 --> 06:19.962
It's obvious we want to be together,
so let's just stop overthinking it

06:20.046 --> 06:23.383
and just be together! [chuckles]

06:24.342 --> 06:25.426
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

06:26.010 --> 06:27.720
-Let's do it.
-Mmm-mmm.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.472
-Sorry.
-Oh, your horn.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.723
[chuckles]

06:32.058 --> 06:33.267
Mmm.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.532
-Good morning, Miss Lopez.
-Hey.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.449
Shall we?

06:49.158 --> 06:50.701
You know what? No.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.620
I am not even gonna ask this time.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.790
Because you two are
the couple who cried "relationship,"

06:55.873 --> 06:58.376
and I am not asking.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.965
Okay, fine. I have to know.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.299
Are you together or not?

07:06.717 --> 07:08.719
-We are.
-Definitely together.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.722
[sighs] Well, it's about damn time.

07:12.348 --> 07:16.310
Hey, guys, you're gonna
wanna brace yourselves for this one.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.062
[Chloe] Brace ourselves? Why?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.689
This seems pretty straightforward.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.568
Yeah. Vic is Arthur Sterling,
the homeowner, gunshot would to the chest.

07:23.651 --> 07:27.029
Safe was broken into, empty,
seems like a simple robbery gone wrong.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.032
Yeah, and the murder weapon is
a pearl-handled .38 stolen from the safe.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.034
It's not the murder. It's the murderer.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.080
It says we already have a full confession
from a perp who was on the scene.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.000
Daniel, are you overthinking this?
Careful, it could ruin your life.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.586
Just follow me.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.046
-Okay.
-[Ella] Hmm?

07:45.548 --> 07:46.883
Aww.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.489
Doctor.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.657
I did it.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.117
I killed him.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.661
Daniel, you could have warned us.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.706
Linda, you killed that man?

08:18.789 --> 08:20.416
I said I did, didn't I?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.584
Okay. Why?

08:22.919 --> 08:26.339
I think the more important question is,
why is it so hard to take me at my word?

08:26.422 --> 08:27.882
Trust issues usually stem

08:27.965 --> 08:30.676
from a problematic relationship
with a parental figure.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.303
Mother, perhaps?

08:32.386 --> 08:36.140
Oh, Detective, don't be fooled
by her sneaky therapist ways.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.268
She's trying to trick you
into overanalyzing your emotions.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.938
And before you know it, you'll be
second-guessing every decision.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.439
I say we just do it.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.649
-Do what?
-This.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.194
Doctor…

08:49.278 --> 08:50.738
what is it you desire?

08:52.740 --> 08:53.741
I…

08:55.701 --> 08:57.370
I wanna protect my child.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.376
Linda, if someone's trying
to hurt Charlie, we can help you.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.003
But how is getting arrested
for murder gonna protect him?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.880
I think our time is up for today.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.884
Okay, well, you've given me no choice.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.512
Dr. Linda Martin,
you're under arrest for murder.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.640
[handcuffs click]

09:24.605 --> 09:26.607
[elevator bell dings]

09:32.655 --> 09:34.365
What the hell is going on here?

09:34.448 --> 09:38.327
Please tell me you don't actually
believe Linda killed somebody.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.370
She confessed, Maze.

09:40.037 --> 09:40.871
You kill somebody?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.081
-Yep.
-Who?

09:42.164 --> 09:43.082
It was…

09:43.874 --> 09:45.084
Doesn't matter.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.961
Impulse crime.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.130
It was a crime of impulse.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.633
My kind of crime. All the best decisions
are made in the heat of the moment.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.720
-[chuckles] Hypothetically, of course.
-And how did you kill them?

09:57.471 --> 09:58.598
Really good.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.016
And hard.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.893
All the way dead.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.395
-She's lying.
-We know.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.106
The gun registered to her is a 9mm,

10:07.189 --> 10:09.317
ballistics says
the murder weapon is a .38.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.444
Not to mention, it's the doctor.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.863
We just don't know why she's lying.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.281
I don't either.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.908
I was talking to her last night and--

10:20.536 --> 10:21.871
-Linda.
-Zip it, Maze.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.913
If you don't tell--

10:22.997 --> 10:23.914
Nope.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.374
-Linda.
-Unh-unh. Nope.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
If you don't tell them, I will.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.964
Well, quite the secret
you've been keeping from us.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.051
A biological daughter
who doesn't know you exist?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.177
Adriana.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.262
And you've been stalking her.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.221
More like…

10:40.431 --> 10:42.391
keeping an eye on her. From a distance.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.101
-Secretly.
-Of course, secretly.

10:44.685 --> 10:47.605
A little harmless stalking
never killed anyone.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.858
Okay, um…

10:52.568 --> 10:54.654
After Maze tracked her down, I…

10:54.737 --> 10:58.366
I told myself to be patient.

11:00.242 --> 11:04.705
Wait for her to find me.
But I couldn't help it.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.041
I had to see her.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.459
So you just did it.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.169
One can definitely understand that.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.921
[Linda] Yes, and good thing I did.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.091
Even from a distance I could
tell she was mixed up in something bad.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.008
Dangerous, even.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.593
Is that why you bought the gun?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.096
No, I bought that
after I was fried by a Goddess

11:20.179 --> 11:21.555
and demons took my baby.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.225
But it is why
I started carrying it with me.

11:24.308 --> 11:29.313
Okay, Linda, you need to tell us
what actually happened last night.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.524
Okay.

11:31.607 --> 11:35.861
So I was tailing Adriana's car…

11:36.737 --> 11:39.949
when suddenly she started
driving like a crazy person.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.076
I knew something was wrong.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.079
So when she went inside the house…

11:45.955 --> 11:48.457
I followed her in,
and that's when I saw the body.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.084
Did you see anyone else?

11:53.462 --> 11:57.216
Okay, Linda, um,
I hate to say it, but it looks like--

11:57.299 --> 12:00.636
Yeah, I know what it looks like.
That's why I turned myself in.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.889
I know Adriana didn't do this.
She couldn't have.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.433
-Why not?
-Because…

12:08.144 --> 12:09.019
Because.

12:09.895 --> 12:13.232
So I'm buying her time to get away
while the cops find the actual killer.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.568
-Sounds like somebody's in denial.
-[Chloe] Hmm.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.696
But if that's what your gut's telling you,
I'm right with you, Doctor.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.614
Anyhow, we're gonna have to bring her in.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.992
Well, then I hope by now
she's far away from here.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.327
She's here.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.505
She doesn't know about me,
and she can't find out. Not like this.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.257
How would she even know who you are?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.926
I met her once, at an open house.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.429
It's a long story,
just promise me you won't tell her.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.097
[Lucifer] Oh.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.767
I did it. I killed him.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.352
Why?

12:51.395 --> 12:52.480
I'm a realtor.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.732
I just sold Mr. Sterling that house.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.193
I knew he was going to be out of town.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.987
And I knew the combination to his safe.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.782
God, it was just
supposed to be a simple robbery.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.659
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
[shudders]

13:06.619 --> 13:09.872
But Mr. Sterling came home
before he was supposed to and…

13:09.955 --> 13:11.290
and he caught me red-handed.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.417
So I shot him.

13:14.084 --> 13:17.546
Do you have the murder weapon
or any of the stolen items?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.633
No. I got rid of everything right away.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.886
I wasn't going to confess.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.763
But the guilt was too much.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.641
That's all I have to say.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.392
[sighs]

13:31.435 --> 13:34.480
Okay, well,
we're gonna need a written statement.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.075
She didn't do it.
I don't know why she's saying this.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.868
Something feels wrong.

13:47.952 --> 13:52.498
Hmm, speaking of things that feel wrong,
but the exact opposite,

13:53.123 --> 13:56.544
the detective and I are together,
and everything feels right.

13:56.627 --> 14:00.297
Neither of us holding anything back,
no unidentified feelings of unease.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.718
-What?
-Well… any thoughts?

14:04.802 --> 14:07.429
You know, on how splendid that is?

14:08.472 --> 14:09.682
[door opens]

14:10.558 --> 14:13.602
-You know she's lying, right?
-I don't know anything yet.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.980
You said yourself she was
the only one you saw at the house,

14:16.063 --> 14:17.231
and we have no other leads.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.149
The scary guy.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.317
Scary guy?

14:20.401 --> 14:22.361
He's the reason
I thought Adriana was mixed up

14:22.444 --> 14:24.238
in something dangerous in the first place.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.532
The other day, I saw her arguing

14:26.615 --> 14:31.203
with this big, intense, scary guy.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.496
Well, there you have it.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.583
First name Scary, last name Guy.
Let's go pick him up, Detective.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.670
I memorized his license plate, in case
something bad happened. And it has.

14:40.462 --> 14:44.508
Okay, we can put a BOLO out, but until
then, Adriana's gonna have to stay here.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.177
Once we find him, you'll see. Scary guy.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.429
Definitely the killer.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.890
Definitely. Definitely. Definitely.

14:50.973 --> 14:51.932
Mm-hmm.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.519
[rock music playing]

15:15.372 --> 15:16.290
All right.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.000
Let's see what you got, Clive.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.281
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

15:50.115 --> 15:51.367
[coughs]

15:52.034 --> 15:53.327
A beanbag round?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.289
You're not Clive.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.543
[electricity crackles]

16:02.628 --> 16:05.422
[both grunting]

16:27.695 --> 16:29.697
[panting]

16:32.866 --> 16:34.994
[woman grunts]

16:35.077 --> 16:37.913
[panting]

16:38.622 --> 16:39.707
Eve.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.333
Maze.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.837
[exhales] Funny seeing you here.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.467
[sighs]

16:50.551 --> 16:53.595
Well, that's what you get
for bringing a beanbag to a demon fight.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.556
-[groans]
-The hell were you thinking?

16:55.639 --> 16:56.932
[chuckles]

16:57.016 --> 17:00.394
That I'd impress you with my ninja moves.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.353
[laughs]

17:03.063 --> 17:04.106
I didn't, did I?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.525
-What are you doing here, Eve?
-[exhales]

17:06.608 --> 17:09.278
Okay, um… [inhales sharply]

17:10.029 --> 17:12.990
[exhales] You know
how I left to go find myself?

17:13.741 --> 17:14.825
Yeah.

17:14.908 --> 17:18.120
Well, I, uh… [inhales sharply]

17:18.203 --> 17:23.542
tried a bunch of stuff,
and nothing quite clicked,

17:23.625 --> 17:28.297
so I thought back to when I was happiest.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.721
Do you remember that time we went
after that guy on that case together?

17:35.804 --> 17:36.764
Vaguely.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.478
Okay, I guess for you it was
just another day at the office, but…

17:43.270 --> 17:46.398
[exclaims] …for me, it was…

17:49.318 --> 17:50.819
different,

17:50.903 --> 17:53.363
and challenging,

17:53.947 --> 17:54.823
and…

17:55.407 --> 17:56.784
[sighs] …scary.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.870
In a good way.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.583
Anyway,

18:04.666 --> 18:09.922
I realized what I had
to do to be happy, you know.

18:10.005 --> 18:13.592
It was really quite clear. I don't know
why it took me so long to realize it,

18:14.176 --> 18:15.094
but, um…

18:16.804 --> 18:19.014
I had to become a bounty hunter.

18:22.810 --> 18:23.727
Okay.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.354
Good luck with that.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.817
Wait! Aren't you
going after that Clive guy too?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.985
We could go after him together.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.445
I work alone.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.405
Please! [sighs]

18:35.489 --> 18:37.616
-I could learn so much from you.
-Oh, good.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.411
-You caught me on my mentoring streak.
-Uh--

18:42.621 --> 18:43.789
Seventy-thirty split!

18:46.416 --> 18:47.501
Eighty-twenty?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.047
[sighs]

18:55.968 --> 18:58.178
-Deal.
-[shouts]

18:58.262 --> 19:00.973
Yay! [clears throat]

19:01.056 --> 19:03.559
So I already
checked the place, you know,

19:03.642 --> 19:07.229
no real clues as to where he could be,
but, um, check this out.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.647
[chuckles]

19:11.275 --> 19:13.026
It's a Hollingshead.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.197
His paintings go
for hundreds of thousands.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.157
[Mazikeen] Huh.

19:22.619 --> 19:27.207
What's an expensive piece of art
doing in a crappy house in Van Nuys?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.711
[clicks tongue]
Exactly what I'm wondering, Teach.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.255
Don't call me that.

19:34.089 --> 19:34.923
Right.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.512
[man] Excuse me, where's Adriana?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.931
Who can I talk to about her?
Adriana Nassar.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.684
-Somebody has to know something!
-Excuse me, hi.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.312
I'm the detective on the case.
Can I help you? Thank you.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.271
[man] Oh, God, yes.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.107
I'm Adriana's boyfriend. Owen.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.609
She didn't do it, Detective.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.986
Really? Yes,
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.613
What? You gonna confess too?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.948
-What?
-Never mind.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.660
Uh, do you have
any actual proof that she's innocent?

20:04.494 --> 20:06.371
No. I don't.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.457
But I think I know who might have done it.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.542
Really? Go ahead.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.460
Okay.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.921
Adriana was having money trouble.

20:14.004 --> 20:14.880
Did she tell you?

20:14.963 --> 20:17.799
Uh, no.
She didn't tell us anything, actually.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.510
[sighs] I think she's afraid.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.888
She took a bad loan.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.057
She got mixed up with some sketchy people.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.185
I overheard her fighting
on the phone with one of them earlier.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.979
Do you know,
was it a guy named Clive Winter?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.856
No, no, it was a woman.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.566
Jamie.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.526
Jamie.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.242
Okay, well,
that gives me enough to work with.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.160
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.204
-Oh.
-[Amenadiel] Drinks on the house.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.455
Oh, l'chaim.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.831
Table seven, on me.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.084
So what was that all about?

20:52.709 --> 20:54.795
[Amenadiel] Ah, just, uh…

20:56.129 --> 20:57.673
just doing some research.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.092
On what? Unflattering headgear?

21:00.175 --> 21:03.178
You don't wanna know, trust me.
It's a lot to take in.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.097
Bro, I've had my mind blown,

21:05.180 --> 21:08.809
figuratively and literally,
so pretty sure I can handle it.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.561
-I think I'm gonna become God.
-[splutters] I'm sor--

21:12.271 --> 21:13.105
What?

21:13.188 --> 21:14.648
Well, my father…

21:15.732 --> 21:18.735
he's retiring, and it appears
that I'm the obvious successor.

21:18.819 --> 21:22.114
So that was a little celestial homework.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.615
A focus group, if you will.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.868
Asking people
what they would like to see in a god.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.495
But enough about me, Dan.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.247
How are you doing, buddy?

21:30.872 --> 21:33.208
Have you recovered
from Lucifer's prank yet?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.085
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.547
I'm having a little trouble focusing on--

21:38.630 --> 21:39.464
I'm sorry.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.134
Freaking God?

21:43.593 --> 21:46.221
You're suddenly gonna
become the father of, like…

21:47.014 --> 21:48.056
the whole world?

21:49.224 --> 21:51.435
It's a little intimidating, honestly.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.936
Sure, I'm sure, bro.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.648
Talk about a promotion.
I couldn't even handle lieutenant.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.900
I'm more of a "boots on the ground" type.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.028
I like the nitty-gritty, day-to-day stuff.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.613
But you're a big picture guy.
You're perfect for this.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.907
The sky's the limit, except not.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.493
[exhales]

22:08.577 --> 22:11.163
Hey, congratulations, man.
I'm happy for you.

22:11.830 --> 22:12.664
Thanks.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.710
[rock music playing]

22:20.964 --> 22:24.509
All right, so, the painting
Maze saw at Clive's house

22:24.593 --> 22:26.136
traces back to this gallery.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.264
-The owner's name is--
-Jamie. Is it Jamie? Say it's Jamie.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.099
Right, and we're in a tizzy, why?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.602
That's who the boyfriend said
Adriana fought with on the phone.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.521
And she's connected with the guy
I saw threatening my daughter?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.899
Shady. Shady. Let's get her to 'fess up.

22:38.982 --> 22:39.858
Linda.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.904
You said I could ride along because my
knowledge of the case could come in handy.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.323
To be fair, you did say
you'd tail us if we didn't bring you.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.324
[sighs]

22:47.407 --> 22:50.702
I do think your privileged intel
is valuable to the case,

22:50.786 --> 22:53.163
but you can't be there
when we interview a suspect.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.498
Okay, fine.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.249
I'll stay right here, then.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.715
Oh. Why don't you
stay here with Linda?

23:03.799 --> 23:04.674
Keep her company.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.677
Of course.
Whatever you need, honey. [chuckles]

23:12.933 --> 23:13.892
[exhales]

23:15.852 --> 23:18.647
Did you notice the words of endearment
between the detective and me?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.774
As I mentioned previously, we're together.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.734
Uh-huh.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.819
"Together" together.

23:23.902 --> 23:28.240
Completely committed, no more
will-they-won't-they shenanigans. So…

23:31.743 --> 23:33.286
[sighs]

23:35.247 --> 23:38.083
And since you insist on asking,
it's going swimmingly.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.127
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.503
What am I doing?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.672
Trying to get me to ask
about your relationship

23:43.755 --> 23:46.550
so we can discuss whatever
emotional reservations you're having.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.968
In case you haven't noticed,

23:48.051 --> 23:50.429
I'm a little preoccupied
with something else.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.140
Emotional reservations,
why would I have any?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.602
Actually, no. Don't answer that.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.980
The last thing I need
is your professional opinion.

24:00.063 --> 24:03.525
In fact, I've realized that therapy
has been a complete waste of my time.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.235
-Oh, my God.
-[sighs]

24:05.318 --> 24:07.320
[scraping]

24:08.530 --> 24:09.364
Look.

24:10.323 --> 24:14.161
Look, that's the exact same van
I saw at one of the houses Adriana sold.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.624
Absurd. What kind of art
is transported in a flower van?

24:20.542 --> 24:21.793
The stolen kind.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.629
No, no, no, the detective
told us to wait for her here.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.423
What happened to Mr. I-follow-my-gut?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.384
Ooh! [grumbles]

24:29.468 --> 24:30.469
Therapists.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.846
Always using your own words against you.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.015
[huffs]

24:35.682 --> 24:36.600
Fine.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.311
But we are following my impulsive lead.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.228
Okay.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.529
Jamie Evington?

24:50.739 --> 24:51.948
Are you the owner?

24:52.032 --> 24:54.159
Detective Decker.
Can I ask you a few questions?

24:54.242 --> 24:55.494
What about?

24:55.577 --> 24:57.579
Do you know Adriana Nassar?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.122
I don't.

24:59.956 --> 25:02.375
Well, didn't she sell your Malibu home?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.169
Oh. [chuckles]

25:04.252 --> 25:05.629
That Adriana.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.506
I barely interacted with her.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.217
And what about Clive Winter?
Does that name ring a bell?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.010
No. Sorry.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.347
That's weird, 'cause he has a painting
from your gallery in his house.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.474
A lot of people have Hollingsheads.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.437
I didn't say it was a Hollingshead.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.237
It's most of my business.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.197
I just assumed.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.535
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have clients to tend to.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.291
-[Lucifer sighs]
-[huffs]

25:43.375 --> 25:45.418
Really, darling, I can pick anything?

25:45.502 --> 25:48.713
Oh, absolutely, darling. Van Gogh ahead.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.923
[Linda chuckles]

25:52.509 --> 25:55.303
-[gasping]
-[Lucifer] Oh! Oh!

25:55.387 --> 25:58.974
Yes! That would look exquisite
next to your vanity, sweetie.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.476
Oh, the colors are so…

26:02.185 --> 26:03.687
colorful. [chuckles]

26:03.770 --> 26:04.604
[Jamie] Good eye.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.733
The artist chose a vibrant palette

26:08.817 --> 26:12.195
to express the complexity
of the couple's emotion.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.198
Or maybe it's not complex at all.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.742
I bet there's nothing
but bliss between these two.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.745
No matter how much my dear Linda
insists on over-analyzing.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.665
The only thing I'm getting is that
she's worried about her daughter,

26:23.748 --> 26:27.210
and that he keeps making
everything about himself.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.588
What a bold and…

26:29.671 --> 26:31.881
oddly specific interpretation.

26:32.465 --> 26:33.592
[Lucifer hesitates]

26:34.676 --> 26:37.095
-That is what I love about art.
-[Linda gasps]

26:37.178 --> 26:38.305
It is so subjective.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.390
-Isn't it? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.393
-I will give you a few to ponder over it.
-[chuckles]

26:45.687 --> 26:47.022
What are we doing?

26:47.105 --> 26:49.441
Clearly Jamie is running
an art theft operation.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.985
-Doesn't mean she killed Sterling.
-She didn't.

26:52.068 --> 26:52.902
Clive did.

26:52.986 --> 26:56.281
He's her muscle.
Don't you see? I mean-- [exhales]

26:56.364 --> 27:00.368
He and Jamie must have strong-armed
Adriana into their crime scheme,

27:00.452 --> 27:04.289
using her to gain access
into high-end houses with valuable art.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.916
Perhaps, but without any proof,
we don't have any leverage,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.003
so let's just leave it
to the professionals, shall we? [chuckles]

27:10.086 --> 27:11.212
[Jamie] So?

27:12.964 --> 27:16.885
Is the lovely couple
interested in the lovely couple?

27:16.968 --> 27:19.971
-[both laugh]
-Well, actually, uh…

27:21.306 --> 27:24.267
we were wondering if you had
something a tad more exclusive?

27:24.351 --> 27:28.063
We understand you have a talent
for acquiring art that is…

27:28.146 --> 27:29.564
[softly] …otherwise engaged.

27:29.648 --> 27:33.735
Hmm. I see. And, uh, what is it
that you are in the market for?

27:33.818 --> 27:34.694
-Matisse.
-Monet.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.696
Well, either is fine.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.991
We collect impressionists
that start with the letter "M," don't we?

27:40.075 --> 27:44.412
As long as they're unattainable,
elusive, prohibitive, beyond reach.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.498
I usually only work with direct referrals.

27:46.581 --> 27:50.627
Well, I can assure you
we are very reliable clients.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.130
I always like to put
my Monet where my mouth is. [chuckles]

27:54.214 --> 27:56.800
Actually, you know what?
I think we'll take the happy couple too.

27:56.883 --> 27:57.759
Yeah.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.094
Okay, then.

28:01.221 --> 28:05.392
Victor at the front desk will take care
of the details for this one, and…

28:05.475 --> 28:07.227
I'll be in touch about the impressionists.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.186
Lovely.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.314
[sighs]

28:22.033 --> 28:24.411
For you, Detective.
Call it an impulse buy.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.414
Thank you.
Never got a present from a sting before.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.748
You're very welcome.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.291
Sting? How was that a sting?

28:30.375 --> 28:33.002
We got diddly squat.
Why aren't you mad that we went rogue?

28:33.086 --> 28:34.921
-Because we didn't.
-[Linda] Huh?

28:35.004 --> 28:38.383
Lucifer secretly called me when you went
into the gallery. I heard the whole thing.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.719
The detective listened in
whilst we charmed Jamie.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.430
Well, I charmed. You babbled mostly.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.766
Okay, then you know about
the fake floral van and the stolen canvas?

28:46.850 --> 28:49.894
Mm-hmm. I had a feeling your knowledge
of the case would come in handy.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.104
Okay, then you agree.

28:51.187 --> 28:54.107
Clive's the killer,
and my daughter is innocent.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.568
Yes, except why would Adriana
take the fall for Clive

28:56.651 --> 28:58.236
if she wasn't involved somehow?

28:58.319 --> 29:00.780
Because Ice Queen Jamie
must have been threatening her.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.949
Didn't you see how intimidating she is?

29:03.032 --> 29:05.034
Bet she could crack a nut with a Kegel.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.746
That's why I needed Lucifer to crack her.

29:07.829 --> 29:10.749
Doctor, what did I tell you
about leaving it to the pros?

29:10.832 --> 29:13.001
The plan is already in motion.
Right, Detective?

29:13.084 --> 29:15.420
Yes, I called in a phone tap warrant
after you baited her.

29:15.503 --> 29:17.797
Now all we need to do
is wait for Jamie to call Clive,

29:17.881 --> 29:19.591
task him with the search of our Monet.

29:19.674 --> 29:22.343
Uh-huh. Ping his cell,
bring him in, now with leverage.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.180
-If Adriana won't tell us what's going on…
-Maybe Clive will.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.264
[both chuckle]

29:27.599 --> 29:29.934
See, Doctor? Perfect match.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.269
[both chuckle]

29:35.774 --> 29:37.692
Ahh, Charlie.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.778
[sniffs, groans]

29:42.280 --> 29:43.865
[chuckles] Hey.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.909
Hey.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.160
Everything go okay?

29:47.243 --> 29:49.537
Oh, yeah. Totes.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.456
It was so much fun.

29:51.539 --> 29:55.210
And you know
I absolutely adore Charlie,

29:55.293 --> 29:59.839
but, uh, I will say, I don't know
how you guys do this all day,

29:59.923 --> 30:02.008
every day, like, every day.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.260
Yeah. It gets easier with practice.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.429
And, you know, I…

30:07.180 --> 30:10.892
-I actually really enjoy the nitty-gritty.
-Hmm.

30:10.975 --> 30:14.437
The day-to-day, the magical stuff. It…

30:15.647 --> 30:18.525
I don't know, it happens
in the small moments, you know?

30:21.611 --> 30:24.447
Well, that was cheesy.
I'm sorry, I, uh… [chuckles]

30:24.531 --> 30:27.492
No, you know what? I-- I totally get it.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.119
God is in the details.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.371
[chuckles]

30:34.040 --> 30:35.250
Speaking of God…

30:37.585 --> 30:39.420
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

30:41.965 --> 30:45.260
Is there anything that
you would change about him, you know,

30:45.885 --> 30:46.803
if you could?

30:46.886 --> 30:49.472
-Change? About God?
-Hmm.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.601
No. I mean,
that's the whole point of faith.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.686
Acceptance.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.604
Right, but…

30:58.606 --> 31:00.108
just for argument's sake.

31:01.651 --> 31:06.531
Imagine if God was standing
right here in front of you, asking you…

31:08.658 --> 31:10.493
"How can I do a better job?"

31:10.577 --> 31:12.704
There's gotta be something you would say.

31:13.621 --> 31:14.497
No.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.124
No. I mean…

31:16.875 --> 31:19.002
God is always there for me.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.379
Always. [chuckles]

31:21.462 --> 31:22.505
He loves me.

31:23.631 --> 31:27.677
Probably more than anyone should, really.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.179
What does that mean?

31:31.681 --> 31:32.599
I have…

31:34.517 --> 31:36.185
I have a lot of darkness.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.274
And the big guy knows and…

31:42.692 --> 31:43.735
he doesn't care.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.404
He's all good.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.032
Which is why I don't deserve him.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.870
I disagree, Ella.

31:55.371 --> 31:56.706
I do.

31:56.789 --> 32:01.628
You see, I think if God was standing
right here, right now, in front of you,

32:01.711 --> 32:05.131
that he would tell you to take
some of that faith that you have in him…

32:07.133 --> 32:08.593
and put it in yourself.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.181
That's…

32:17.977 --> 32:20.647
Thank you for saying that, Amenadiel. I…

32:24.150 --> 32:25.485
I'm gonna try.

Well, the cops traced a call
that artsy-fartsy bitch made to him.

33:09.112 --> 33:13.616
His cell number pinged near this shady
warehouse that I'm very familiar with.

You covered that earlier.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.484
you didn't exactly jump into my arms.

37:28.704 --> 37:31.207
[panting]

37:34.085 --> 37:35.795
Not bad for a newbie.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.923
[chuckles] Thanks, Teach.

37:41.092 --> 37:41.926
Hey.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.512
Oh, my God.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.807
Oh, my God, Eve, you're shot.
Hey, look at me.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.392
-Maze…
-You okay?

37:49.475 --> 37:50.518
Mm-hmm.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.353
[man groans]

37:53.646 --> 37:54.689
[gasps]

37:56.649 --> 37:57.984
[loud bang]

37:58.067 --> 37:59.777
[high-pitched ringing tone]

37:59.860 --> 38:01.654
[muffled grunting]

38:07.326 --> 38:09.620
[Mazikeen shouts]

38:14.792 --> 38:18.337
-[muffled dialogue]
-[Eve groaning]

38:18.421 --> 38:21.340
Hey, stay with me, Eve.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.510
Eve. Eve! Eve!

38:24.593 --> 38:26.762
[sobs] Come on, stay with me!

38:34.312 --> 38:36.564
-Hang on. I got you.
-[Eve groans]

38:51.078 --> 38:54.290
[loud chattering]

39:03.424 --> 39:05.217
[door opens]

39:05.301 --> 39:06.135
Is Eve okay?

39:07.928 --> 39:09.847
Um, I hope so.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.266
She's in surgery at the moment.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.393
Told you Clive was a scary guy.

39:14.477 --> 39:17.855
And Jamie's muscle in the burglary scheme.
Right on both counts.

39:17.938 --> 39:20.107
Maybe I should become a police consultant.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.275
[chuckles]

39:21.984 --> 39:23.736
So are they letting Adriana go now?

39:24.445 --> 39:27.698
Well, it seems that
you were right about something else.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.076
Adriana was part of the scheme.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.953
She was the one
who told Jamie and Clive

39:33.037 --> 39:35.414
about the houses
that were ripe for the robbing.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.585
Yeah, because they were forcing her to,
like I said. So who's our new suspect?

39:42.421 --> 39:43.339
There is…

39:44.465 --> 39:46.300
There is a new suspect, right?

39:47.259 --> 39:51.722
Maze found the murder weapon
at the warehouse with the stolen items.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.725
It had Adriana's prints on it.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.440
Come on, no.

40:02.608 --> 40:03.567
No, it can't be.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.320
Why not? And please don't say "because."

40:06.404 --> 40:07.530
Because!

40:09.657 --> 40:12.326
Because if it is, I'm to blame.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.545
It's my fault she's broken.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.133
[sighs]

40:28.259 --> 40:31.053
[hesitates] Anyway.
Enough with the bad news.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.097
On to what really matters.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.516
The detective and I just had--

40:35.599 --> 40:38.144
A spat! A spat, I know! I saw.

40:39.311 --> 40:43.983
I know, and now you want me
to weigh in on your relationship.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.610
That's all this has been
from the start, isn't it?

40:47.361 --> 40:50.739
You never really cared about helping me.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.701
You just needed a ride-along therapist.

40:53.784 --> 40:57.496
For once, I needed you to care
about someone other than yourself,

40:57.580 --> 40:59.582
to care about me!

41:00.666 --> 41:02.293
You know what? Lucifer, you're right.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.087
Therapy has failed.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.425
I've failed.

41:11.510 --> 41:15.639
You're just as selfish
and self-absorbed as you--

41:18.476 --> 41:19.935
What is she doing here?

41:22.313 --> 41:23.647
Like I was saying…

41:25.441 --> 41:27.860
the detective and I just had a chat,

41:27.943 --> 41:30.070
and we decided to talk to Adriana again.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.823
But all the evidence points to her.
You think she's guilty.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.700
But you don't.

41:38.287 --> 41:42.041
My self-centeredness aside,
I am trying to help. We all are.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.293
And we're not giving up.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.378
So…

41:47.755 --> 41:50.132
shall we see
what your daughter has to say?

41:51.967 --> 41:52.927
[Adriana] Nothing.

41:53.802 --> 41:56.931
I have nothing to say.
I wrote down everything I know.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.519
Well, we looked at your statement
and did some legwork.

42:01.602 --> 42:05.022
There are some pieces missing
that we would like you to fill in.

42:05.105 --> 42:09.193
Just close the investigation already.
I did it. That's all I'm gonna say.

42:09.276 --> 42:12.655
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Tell me, Adriana.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.533
What is it you desire?

42:19.161 --> 42:19.995
I want…

42:22.122 --> 42:23.457
to protect my mother.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.631
[Adriana] My mother's sick.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.551
She has been for a while.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.177
The treatment is expensive.

42:35.261 --> 42:38.681
Is that why you're having money troubles?
Owen told us that.

42:38.764 --> 42:41.767
Yeah. I mortgaged my condo,
depleted my savings.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.686
I had nothing left.

42:43.769 --> 42:46.105
Then you met Miss Thomas Crown Affair.

42:46.188 --> 42:49.984
-Jamie approached you, didn't she?
-[Adriana] She said I'd make fast cash.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.986
She promised no one would get hurt.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.321
She convinced you
to give up your clients' alarm codes,

42:54.405 --> 42:56.949
where the valuables were,
and when they wouldn't be home?

42:57.032 --> 42:58.492
And Clive did the dirty work?

43:00.369 --> 43:01.996
I tried to back out.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.539
-I did.
-But they threatened you?

43:03.622 --> 43:05.249
They said they'd kill my mom.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.835
[inhales] I felt trapped.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.255
I was looking for a way out

43:11.338 --> 43:15.676
when I suddenly heard about a last-minute
change in Mr. Sterling's travel plans.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.304
He was coming home early,

43:19.263 --> 43:22.433
on the night that Clive was
supposed to rob his place.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.059
I panicked.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.812
You tried to warn Clive?
Is that why you texted him?

43:26.895 --> 43:30.608
Texted him? No, I called him,
and he wasn't picking up,

43:30.691 --> 43:32.693
so I rushed over to the house and…

43:34.111 --> 43:35.112
it was too late.

43:37.489 --> 43:42.411
Clive must have been surprised
by Mr. Sterling and killed him.

43:42.494 --> 43:45.748
Except Clive wasn't stripping down
Mr. Sterling's house.

43:45.831 --> 43:48.000
He was at some strip club on The Strip.

43:48.083 --> 43:50.002
[Chloe]
Records show he was in Vegas that night.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.046
According to him,
you called the sting off early.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.631
He said you texted him Friday night.

43:53.714 --> 43:54.715
Friday?

43:55.591 --> 43:58.636
No, I didn't even hear about
Mr. Sterling's change of plans

43:58.719 --> 43:59.928
until Saturday.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.473
-Right before I rushed over to the house.
-[Lucifer sighs]

44:04.058 --> 44:05.893
I was at the movies on Friday night.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.102
I didn't…

44:07.186 --> 44:09.772
Please, you have to believe me.

44:09.855 --> 44:11.690
All I want is to protect my mom.

44:12.274 --> 44:14.276
All of this, I did for her.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.322
Got it. Thanks.

44:19.239 --> 44:22.368
Hey! So Adriana's mom's safe.
Did you find Linda?

44:22.451 --> 44:25.704
No, it appears she's left.
Probably got too emotional for her.

44:25.788 --> 44:26.789
Yeah. Oh, hi.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.583
Control Freak Lopez for the win!

44:29.667 --> 44:33.128
So, I myself didn't personally process
the murder weapon the first time around,

44:33.212 --> 44:35.422
so I said, "Know what?
I should take another look,"

44:35.506 --> 44:37.383
and winner, winner, chicken dinner!

44:37.466 --> 44:39.677
The gun was wiped down, you guys.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.513
And there was just
one Adriana fingerprint on it.

44:42.596 --> 44:43.430
That's fishy.

44:43.514 --> 44:47.810
And for the double whammy,
I also found methyl acrylate on the gun.

44:47.893 --> 44:50.688
A drug I've never heard of or done.
Now that's fishy.

44:50.771 --> 44:52.064
Oh, no. It's not a drug.

44:52.147 --> 44:55.025
It's a substance found
on the sticky side of Scotch tape.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.861
Someone used the tape
to transfer the print to the gun.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.780
So Adriana was framed.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.323
By Clive?

45:01.407 --> 45:03.742
I don't think so,
I checked the phone records.

45:03.826 --> 45:04.660
He's not lying.

45:04.743 --> 45:07.621
Clive did receive a text
from Adriana calling off the job.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.707
-Doesn't mean Adriana sent it.
-[Chloe] Right.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.710
Who else had access to her phone
when she was in the movies?

45:12.793 --> 45:14.253
If only the doctor were still here.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.880
She'd probably know,
with all her stalking and whatnot.

45:16.964 --> 45:17.923
[sighs]

45:18.882 --> 45:20.300
I think I know who did this.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.845
And that's a bad thing?

45:22.928 --> 45:25.139
Only if Linda figured it out too.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.599
-[Lucifer mutters]
-Okay.

45:35.441 --> 45:36.275
[Linda] Owen.

45:38.068 --> 45:39.653
You need to turn yourself in.

45:40.946 --> 45:44.158
I got no idea who you are
and no idea what you're talking about.

45:44.241 --> 45:47.244
I'm someone
who actually cares about Adriana,

45:47.828 --> 45:51.039
not someone who pretends to care
while framing her for murder.

45:51.123 --> 45:54.168
-Wait, what?
-I saw you step out of the theater.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.754
I thought, "Aww, so polite,

45:56.837 --> 45:59.214
he doesn't wanna text during the movie."

45:59.298 --> 46:00.716
Well, polite my ass.

46:00.799 --> 46:04.970
You were texting Clive on Adriana's cell,
telling him the sting was off,

46:05.053 --> 46:09.057
so you could take the spoils for yourself.
You killed Mr. Sterling.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.810
Give me the gun before
somebody throws you in the loony bin.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.312
No, not until you confess.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.731
[chuckles]

46:18.150 --> 46:19.943
You think I won't shoot, huh?

46:21.111 --> 46:21.945
Oh, I get it.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.072
I look like a good person.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.949
Well, I'm not.

46:26.992 --> 46:28.702
I've been a terrible mother.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.998
I've done nothing
for Adriana her entire life.

46:34.583 --> 46:39.588
This is the one thing I can do,
so I'm saving her from you.

46:39.671 --> 46:40.798
One way or another.

46:41.465 --> 46:42.299
[Chloe] Linda!

46:42.382 --> 46:43.717
Put down the gun.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.594
I can't let him get away with this.

46:45.677 --> 46:47.262
He framed Adriana!

46:48.055 --> 46:49.306
T-this woman is nuts.

46:49.389 --> 46:52.768
Careful, that woman is a doctor,
and an excellent one at that.

46:52.851 --> 46:54.686
-Linda.
-But-- [scoffs]

46:54.770 --> 46:56.688
Why would I frame my own girlfriend?

46:56.772 --> 46:59.274
I was the one that told you
she was innocent, Detective.

46:59.358 --> 47:01.485
You're also the one
who pointed the finger at Jamie,

47:01.568 --> 47:02.945
which led us to the warehouse

47:03.028 --> 47:05.364
and the murder weapon
that you planted, which was smart,

47:05.447 --> 47:07.741
but now we have forensic evidence

47:07.825 --> 47:10.494
that Adriana's print
was transferred to the gun.

47:10.577 --> 47:12.037
You're under arrest.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.413
[Owen] No.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.251
You did it, Doctor.

47:19.711 --> 47:21.088
You saved your daughter.

47:24.550 --> 47:27.678
-[exhales]
-[sobs]

47:32.349 --> 47:33.225
Thank you.

47:37.688 --> 47:38.647
Hey.

47:39.606 --> 47:42.442
You look really familiar. Do I know you?

47:42.526 --> 47:44.403
No, I don't think so.

47:44.486 --> 47:47.030
Didn't you come
to an open house a while back?

47:47.614 --> 47:48.448
I'm a realtor.

47:49.783 --> 47:53.370
Oh. Right. Uh, maybe.

47:53.453 --> 47:54.454
Maybe.

47:55.372 --> 47:58.917
If you're wondering what I'm doing here
at the police station, I just, um…

47:59.626 --> 48:00.586
These are my friends.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.171
And, uh,
they were helping me with something…

48:04.464 --> 48:05.299
important.

48:06.216 --> 48:07.050
That's nice.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.136
They helped me too.

48:09.970 --> 48:13.098
Could have been really bad if they hadn't.

48:13.181 --> 48:14.099
Yeah.

48:15.392 --> 48:16.894
I mean, that's nice.

48:20.188 --> 48:22.024
Well, I guess I should be going.

48:22.524 --> 48:23.442
Hey.

48:27.863 --> 48:29.156
I'm glad you're okay.

48:31.283 --> 48:32.117
Thanks.

48:44.087 --> 48:48.300
[sighs] All right, Lucifer,
you have my undivided attention.

48:48.383 --> 48:50.052
What is it you wanted to talk about?

48:50.135 --> 48:53.138
The only thing
I want to talk about is you.

48:54.097 --> 48:56.934
So. Have you told her you're her mom yet?

49:00.354 --> 49:02.439
No. I'm being…

49:03.649 --> 49:04.524
respectful.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.027
Well, in the words
of a wise woman I know,

49:07.110 --> 49:09.279
that sounds an awful lot
like avoidance to me.

49:09.363 --> 49:10.697
Boundaries are important.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.157
Says the stalker.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.242
[both chuckle]

49:19.164 --> 49:21.041
Why didn't you tell her, Doctor?

49:25.003 --> 49:26.922
I do think it should be her choice.

49:27.839 --> 49:30.300
But if I'm being honest, I guess…

49:31.134 --> 49:32.052
I'm afraid.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.849
Of rejection, I just…

49:39.059 --> 49:42.396
Not that I have
a relationship with her now, I just…

49:42.479 --> 49:45.357
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.817
It makes perfect sense.

49:48.235 --> 49:50.070
You want to know her, to be with her,

49:50.153 --> 49:54.282
it's everything you've ever wanted,
but you can't completely open yourself up

49:54.366 --> 49:57.077
because deep down
you actually believe that you don't…

49:57.995 --> 49:59.287
deserve her love.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.832
Because she's so perfect,

Awfully insightful of you, Lucifer.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.893
Maybe you should become a therapist.

Ha! Thank you.

50:43.832 --> 50:47.127
You know, back there when you got shot…

50:48.879 --> 50:49.880
I hated that.

50:49.963 --> 50:53.467
Yeah, it wasn't great
for me either. [chuckles]

50:53.550 --> 50:56.261
I never felt like that before.
It was weird.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.973
New, and I was…

51:00.057 --> 51:01.349
[Eve] Afraid?

51:02.726 --> 51:04.436
Yeah. I guess.

51:06.021 --> 51:10.650
I mean, I've felt fear before,
but that was a whole… other level.

51:13.487 --> 51:16.364
Maze, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

51:27.334 --> 51:29.252
I wanna be with you too, Eve.

52:11.044 --> 52:13.213

52:26.685 --> 52:28.937
I guess I have grown a soul.

52:30.313 --> 52:34.067
But if this is what a soul feels like,
I don't wanna feel it again.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.652
Sweetie, I…

52:36.236 --> 52:37.988
I don't wanna live forever.

52:40.949 --> 52:41.992
Why the hell not?

Because I saw what it did to my son, Cain.

Hi.

54:18.338 --> 54:21.007
The police weren't helping you, were they?

54:21.758 --> 54:23.802
You were helping them with my case.

54:25.095 --> 54:25.929
Uh…

54:27.180 --> 54:28.890
I just wanted to say thank you.

It was no big deal.

Sure.

I've been wanting to tell you.

You're my mom.

Aren't you?

How did you know?

you look at everybody
