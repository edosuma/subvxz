WEBVTT

00:10.088 --> 00:12.089
Wow, long line.

00:12.090 --> 00:14.341
Popular joint.

00:14.461 --> 00:16.510
I don't know about you, but I'm
so glad this place opened.

00:16.630 --> 00:19.941
That gas station swill is so bad I
almost started drinking tea-- tea!

00:20.079 --> 00:22.654
This isn't new. Bash is an
institution around here.

00:22.774 --> 00:24.383
- Bash?
- Short for Sebastian.

00:24.384 --> 00:26.818
He was away at a coffee
competition in Europe.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.608
I'm guessing the competition
wasn't a race.

00:29.689 --> 00:32.448
- Long wait.
- Not if you're reading.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.340
- Hi.
- I've got trig.

00:36.460 --> 00:37.403
Hope it's not contagious.

00:43.876 --> 00:46.005
Hey!
I know this guy.

00:46.125 --> 00:50.482
It's my friend Richard--
big fancy choreographer now.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.283
We were in the chorus together,

00:52.284 --> 00:53.982
probably before you
were even born.

00:54.102 --> 00:55.487
Dear lord,
that's actually true.

00:58.457 --> 01:01.692
Fair trade, single-origin
Nicaraguan macchiato

01:01.693 --> 01:04.595
with notes of honeydew,
fig and hard candy.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.963
Is that a peace symbol
in the foam?

01:06.964 --> 01:08.783
It is.
Sorry it took so long,

01:08.903 --> 01:11.602
but my first one looked like a
Mercedes symbol, so I had to redo it.

01:11.603 --> 01:13.619
Thank you.

01:15.173 --> 01:17.073
Hi, I'd like the biggest
coffee you have.

01:17.074 --> 01:18.914
- Bup.
- Sorry, first time here.

01:19.034 --> 01:21.623
Do you call your large a small
or have some other crazy system?

01:21.833 --> 01:25.068
- I don't subscribe to the customer-gets-to-choose thing.
- Really?

01:25.069 --> 01:27.404
- No.
- It's a popular subscription.

01:27.405 --> 01:30.207
- How many coffee-brewing awards do you have?
- 12.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.124
I beat the Italians
and the French.

01:33.244 --> 01:35.160
I see.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.960
No one beats the Italians
and the French.

01:36.961 --> 01:38.663
They have roasts
named after them.

01:38.664 --> 01:40.264
I'm sure your mother
is very proud.

01:40.265 --> 01:42.032
I have two dads.
Don't assume.

01:42.033 --> 01:44.063
Can we get back to coffee?

01:44.183 --> 01:46.695
I'm guessing you like
a dry nonfat latte,

01:46.815 --> 01:49.728
- extra shot of espresso.
- Wow, you're dead on.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.906
Okay, I guess you can
order for me.

01:52.026 --> 01:54.777
- That's the devil's brew.
- The devil has good taste.

01:54.778 --> 01:56.637
I need to ask you
a few questions.

01:56.731 --> 01:59.275
- Are you currently taking any medications?
- Just Martinis.

01:59.395 --> 02:01.920
- Where do you like your milk to come from?
- A cow?

02:02.040 --> 02:05.405
- Have you eaten anything spicy in the last 24 hours?
- Some sketchy chicken

02:05.406 --> 02:07.774
that frankly could still go either
way, but nothing spicy, no.

02:07.775 --> 02:09.942
How did you feel about
"The Year of Magical Thinking"?

02:09.943 --> 02:11.577
- What does that have to do with my coffee?
- Nothing.

02:11.697 --> 02:13.980
- I was making conversation.
- Oh, well, I haven't actually had a chance to read--

02:13.981 --> 02:15.915
bup bup.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.898
I need to focus on the beans.

02:21.254 --> 02:22.844
- That's good.
- ( Bean clinks )

02:25.958 --> 02:27.125
That's good.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.925
Can I read your trig?

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074

And!

03:08.132 --> 03:10.399
Are you filled with lead?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.928
This is "The Nutcracker,"
not "Dumbo."

03:14.337 --> 03:17.806
( Groans )
Straighten your knees.

03:17.807 --> 03:21.110
- Just looking for my phone.
- Again?

03:21.111 --> 03:23.785
- You won't even notice me.
- Seems unlikely. Next group.

03:25.648 --> 03:28.066
Arabesque, Matisse.

03:29.151 --> 03:32.420
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

03:32.421 --> 03:34.956
- It's been happening all morning.
- You're killing dancers?

03:34.957 --> 03:37.259
- I'm thinning the herd.
- This is not all right.

03:37.379 --> 03:40.005
- At least I'm getting to rest.
- You'll be getting lots of rest.

03:40.125 --> 03:43.097
Take your things, ray ray.
You're not needed.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.497
Why are you stopping?
Were you perfect?

03:45.575 --> 03:48.392
No, you were not perfect. Michelle,
show them how it's done.

03:48.512 --> 03:50.221
- Me?
- Yes, you.

03:50.341 --> 03:52.448
They need to see
what a proper jete looks like.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.523
- I don't think that's appropriate.
- You're a dancer, right?

03:54.643 --> 03:56.518
- Yes.
- And this is a dance studio, right?

03:56.519 --> 03:59.025
- It is.
- Then I can't imagine anything more appropriate.

03:59.145 --> 04:01.137
- But I'm not even warmed up.
- Oh, just do it.

04:01.257 --> 04:02.390
( Sighs )

04:17.105 --> 04:20.274
- That was terrible.
- I told you I wasn't warmed up!

04:20.274 --> 04:22.946
You also told me you were in A.B.T.
Who knows what to believe?

04:23.066 --> 04:24.544
You know what?
This isn't fun.

04:24.545 --> 04:27.347
All right, let's try it again.

04:29.117 --> 04:33.107
Madame Fanny, we've been
doing this for three hours.

04:33.227 --> 04:36.784
- May we please take a break?
- ( Exasperated sigh ) Fine.

04:36.904 --> 04:40.160
Two minutes-- no water,
no sitting.

04:40.161 --> 04:43.151
And don't think you can
sneak in a lean either.

04:43.271 --> 04:45.464
( Girls chattering )

04:45.465 --> 04:48.333
"The Nutcracker" is performed
thousands of times a year.

04:48.334 --> 04:51.403
Why can everyone else
find a Clara and I can't?

04:51.404 --> 04:54.572
- It's the world's lamest conspiracy.
- Here, you're driving me crazy.

04:54.573 --> 04:56.574
- Use it to call your phone.
- It's on vibrate. We won't hear it.

04:56.575 --> 04:59.912
Oh please, vibrate still makes
that annoying buzzing sound

04:59.913 --> 05:03.182
everyone hears even though we're all
supposed to pretend it's silent.

05:03.183 --> 05:06.217
- Look at that, you just found a lamer conspiracy.
- All I'm saying

05:06.218 --> 05:09.275
is you may as well have a ring tone, then
at least we could find the damn thing.

05:09.395 --> 05:11.856
So I just found out
my friend Richard's

05:11.857 --> 05:15.301
- choreographing a touring company of "Follies."
- That's a fun show.

05:15.421 --> 05:17.522
Yeah. He and I were
in the chorus together

05:17.523 --> 05:20.056
a million years ago.
We spent this crazy summer

05:20.176 --> 05:23.694
at a rental at Martha's vineyard and we
came up with one of those silly pacts

05:23.695 --> 05:26.158
that whoever made it first
would help the other one.

05:26.398 --> 05:29.934
- That's silly, right?
- Michelle, are you still considering performing?

05:29.935 --> 05:32.036
No. Not really.
I don't know.

05:32.037 --> 05:34.304
- I like the show.
- Then call him.

05:34.305 --> 05:37.055
Huh-uh. I don't beg for work.
It feels desperate.

05:37.175 --> 05:40.409
You're right. And you realize
that's how every great performer

05:40.410 --> 05:42.779
- made it, by waiting quietly.
- Oh, you know what I mean.

05:42.780 --> 05:44.714
I'm sure when Brad Pitt
was starting out

05:44.715 --> 05:47.050
he just sat at home waiting
for people to find him.

05:47.051 --> 05:48.526
Okay, that's a terrible example.
He's Brad Pitt.

05:48.646 --> 05:50.232
I'm sure he could just
sit at home and wait.

05:50.352 --> 05:52.854
Well, my dear,
you are no Brad Pitt.

05:52.855 --> 05:55.991
Look, if Richard wants to
find me, he can find me.

05:55.992 --> 05:58.827
How? You're not on Facebook
like a normal person.

05:58.828 --> 06:01.063
And cellphones weren't
even around back then,

06:01.064 --> 06:02.339
so he certainly doesn't
have your number.

06:02.459 --> 06:05.946
And even if he did, it would be a miracle
if you knew where your phone was.

06:06.313 --> 06:09.437
- Where was it? - I'm not telling you
until you get a ringtone.

06:11.172 --> 06:13.608
All right, enough resting.

06:13.609 --> 06:16.376
I want chaines across
the room on the diagonal.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.378
- And!
- ( Tapping stick )

06:21.883 --> 06:24.351
Hi, I'm calling for Richard.

06:24.352 --> 06:27.420
Oh sure, just tell him
Michelle Simms called.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.575
I'm an old friend. Oh, and
tell him I said to watch out

06:30.695 --> 06:33.793
for the strawberries and bikini bottoms.
He'll know what it means.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.883
- Michelle, must you?
- You told me to!

06:38.332 --> 06:40.766
Where are you spotting?

06:40.767 --> 06:43.065
It was an inside joke we had
at Martha's vineyard.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.771
Okay, well, have him call me
as soon as he gets the message.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.473
Yeah, this number.
Thanks.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.722
- Hey!
- Melanie: Shh! Don't call attention to us!

06:50.842 --> 06:53.478
- We're hiding from Fanny.
- Melanie: We don't want her to think of us for Clara.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.347
So we're hoping it's out
of sight, out of mind.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.173
- I'm pretty sure Fanny can sense you.
- Shh!

06:57.293 --> 06:59.183
Okay, sorry sorry.
I'm not good at quiet.

06:59.184 --> 07:01.799
- Crouch.
- What?

07:01.919 --> 07:05.023
If madame Fanny looks out here, she's
going to think you're talking to a bush.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.925
Well, now she'll think
I'm praying to one.

07:07.926 --> 07:11.395
Look, I know Fanny's crazy, but
would it be so bad to play Clara?

07:11.396 --> 07:13.752
That's not an opportunity
that comes along every day.

07:13.872 --> 07:16.891
No one's ever going to live up to Sasha.
It's a losing proposition.

07:17.011 --> 07:19.116
And I'm very happy as a sugar plum fairy.
It's what I've been

07:19.236 --> 07:21.872
for the past 10 years, and it's
what my fans have come to expect.

07:21.873 --> 07:24.107
- Your fans?
- Well, my mother and Josh.

07:24.108 --> 07:26.342
Probably now just my mother
since I broke up with Josh.

07:28.479 --> 07:30.480
Don't honk!
Don't honk!

07:30.600 --> 07:32.695
Oh sure, tell everyone the
Jewish girl's in the attic.

07:32.815 --> 07:36.387
- What?
- She's calling way more attention to you than I was!

07:36.507 --> 07:39.021
That's our getaway car. You're
welcome to stay here if you want.

07:39.022 --> 07:41.190
Crouched in the bushes?
Enticing, but no.

07:41.191 --> 07:43.333
So what's the plan?

07:43.453 --> 07:46.219
- Do we make him drive us to get tampons?
- I'm starting to think

07:46.339 --> 07:49.586
- it's not fair to make Charlie drive us around all the time.
- It's totally fair.

07:49.706 --> 07:52.501
We're helping my parents teach him a
lesson about recreational drug use.

07:52.621 --> 07:55.678
- Those weren't drugs; they were pizza spices.
- That you planted in his room.

07:55.798 --> 07:58.031
Then we're teaching him a lesson
about keeping his door locked.

07:58.151 --> 08:01.335
- Either way lessons are being learned.
- Loser, I'm waiting!

08:01.455 --> 08:03.882
For what, chest hair? 'Cause
that's never gonna happen.

08:04.002 --> 08:05.566
I think I'll just get
a ride with boo this time.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.268
- I'm going straight to work.
- Then I'll come with you.

08:08.388 --> 08:11.418
- I can study in the walk-in or something.
- Don't be weird. Come on.

08:11.419 --> 08:12.753
We'll stop by later.

08:22.629 --> 08:24.364
- What are you doing?
- Sitting in back.

08:24.484 --> 08:27.618
No, ugly sits in back, otherwise
it causes an accident.

08:29.766 --> 08:31.971
You know I like to stretch out.
That's the deal.

08:31.972 --> 08:33.462
I stretch out in the backseat

08:33.582 --> 08:36.615
and you sit in front and
mess up his radio stations.

08:42.136 --> 08:45.450
- So you're the one who messes with my stations?
- Uh...

08:45.451 --> 08:48.419
- I guess I owe Dez an apology.
- Yeah.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.588
Don't let me stop you.
Do your thing.

08:51.589 --> 08:53.523
That's okay.
This station's fine.

08:53.524 --> 08:56.026
- The radio's not on.
- Right.

08:56.027 --> 08:58.361
- Right.
- ( Engine starts )

09:03.906 --> 09:06.728
I'm on my 10. That's restaurant
talk for 10-minute break.

09:06.848 --> 09:09.260
Thanks for clarifying. Your
code was pretty hard to crack.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.275
- Where's Sasha?
- I don't know. She texted she was coming.

09:12.276 --> 09:14.470
It's so weird not seeing her
at ballet every day.

09:14.590 --> 09:17.345
- I kind of miss her.
- She'd slug you if she heard you say that.

09:17.346 --> 09:18.847
Oh, that makes me
miss her even more.

09:18.848 --> 09:20.515
What if she just
apologized to Fanny?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.284
Fanny obviously wants her back.

09:22.285 --> 09:23.952
But how do we get her
to apologize?

09:23.953 --> 09:25.888
It might not be that hard.
I mean, do Sasha

09:25.889 --> 09:27.856
and cheerleading really seem
like a match made in heaven?

09:27.857 --> 09:30.024
Cheerleaders are perky
and spunky and bouncy.

09:30.025 --> 09:31.926
- All adjectives Sasha hates.
- What do I hate?

09:31.927 --> 09:33.828
Being late when
I only have a 10.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.426
- That's code for a 10-minute break.
- Sorry.

09:35.546 --> 09:38.514
I was on my way, but then I found a mix
CD on my doorstep from my secret sister

09:38.634 --> 09:41.137
- and I had to go back in and listen to it.
- What's a secret sister?

09:41.257 --> 09:43.745
Cheerleading thing. The older girls
are matched up with the new ones,

09:43.865 --> 09:46.087
- and they surprise us with presents.
- Sweet.

09:46.207 --> 09:48.543
Unfortunately, mine is an idiot
who doesn't seem to realize

09:48.663 --> 09:51.898
that putting her initials on everything
blows the whole "secret" part of it.

09:52.018 --> 09:55.581
Especially when her initials are Z.Q.
But she makes me brownies

09:55.582 --> 09:57.488
and puts them in my locker
like we're going steady.

09:57.608 --> 09:59.748
- Sounds annoying and fattening.
- It's not that bad.

09:59.868 --> 10:01.736
- Seriously?
- Once you accept the fact that you spend

10:01.856 --> 10:04.857
- a lot of time in sneakers, it's kind of fun.
- Cheerleading?

10:04.858 --> 10:06.476
Yeah.
And it's super easy.

10:06.596 --> 10:09.590
We only practice an hour a day--
less if anyone has cramps or zits.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.630
An hour? I can't
even imagine that.

10:11.631 --> 10:13.196
What do you do
with all your free time?

10:13.316 --> 10:16.360
I'm finally exploring that Internet
everyone's been talking about,

10:16.480 --> 10:19.367
- and then there's TV.
- I remember TV.

10:19.487 --> 10:22.266
The best part is I don't even have
to multi-task while watching it.

10:22.386 --> 10:24.794
I can just sit there,
like someone in the Midwest.

10:24.914 --> 10:27.984
- I'm officially depressed.
- Oh, come on, we're having fun too.

10:28.104 --> 10:29.478
Yeah, tell me,
what's the latest?

10:29.598 --> 10:31.683
- Fanny's gone psycho since you left.
- Really?

10:31.803 --> 10:35.800
Like full on bates motel, shower stabbing,
wearing your mother's wig "Psycho."

10:35.920 --> 10:37.587
- No way.
- She can't find anyone for Clara.

10:37.588 --> 10:39.389
And she's torturing
everyone in the process.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.595
- ( Phone chimes )
- Vanessa has a black eye.

10:40.715 --> 10:43.393
- We're just not even talking about it.
- ( Laughs )

10:43.394 --> 10:45.160
- What?
- My secret sister.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.843
She wants me to go to the
soccer field for a surprise.

10:48.096 --> 10:50.599
Zoey Quindlin,
what will you think of next?

10:50.600 --> 10:53.970
- ( Giggles )
- Did she giggle?

10:53.971 --> 10:55.956
Melanie:
Worse-- she giggle-texted.

10:56.076 --> 10:59.721
She's one high ponytail away
from needing an intervention.

11:00.958 --> 11:03.560
Hi, it's Michelle Simms
calling again for Richard.

11:02.805 --> 11:04.940
Oh okay, no,
I'm sure he's busy.

11:04.941 --> 11:07.508
I just-- would you mind
reading my message back to me?

11:07.509 --> 11:10.496
I wanna make sure it's right.

11:11.306 --> 11:13.123
Yeah, that's what I said.

11:13.243 --> 11:16.130
Although, now that I think about
it, let's lose the bikini bottoms.

11:16.459 --> 11:19.168
Which, funny enough,
is what happened in the story.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.022
Or maybe not so funny.
Okay,

11:22.023 --> 11:25.257
so just tell him Michelle Simms

11:25.258 --> 11:26.752
♪ from the rental
called! ♪

11:26.872 --> 11:28.927
You don't have
to do the inflection.

11:28.928 --> 11:30.162
Oh, just have him call me.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.435
I came prepared this time.
Lots of reading material.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.063
- ( Phone ringing )
- Oh, that was fast.

11:39.183 --> 11:42.215
Probably too fast, unless he walked in
just as his assistant was hanging up

11:42.335 --> 11:44.341
and was like, "Wait!"
But she was like, "I just hung up."

11:44.342 --> 11:45.976
And he was like,
"Call her back, bitch."

11:46.096 --> 11:48.646
I don't know why Richard's talking
to his assistant like that.

11:48.647 --> 11:50.856
Oh my God, okay,

11:50.976 --> 11:53.217
I used to keep it on vibrate,
but there was this-- oh!

11:56.721 --> 11:59.289
( Phone ringing )

11:59.290 --> 12:01.725
- That did not happen.
- I am so sorry.

12:01.726 --> 12:04.161
I made a perfect likeness
of Bob in the foam.

12:04.281 --> 12:07.173
Weird-- I had a frosted flake this
morning that looked like Simon le Bon.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.671
- He went to get his camera.
- Good, you can make another one.

12:09.791 --> 12:11.621
I am an artist.
It doesn't work like that.

12:11.741 --> 12:13.823
Oh, come on, I'd expect
that defeatist attitude

12:13.943 --> 12:15.698
from the French baristas,
but not you.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.660
I'm here, I'm here.
Don't hang up!

12:17.780 --> 12:19.533
Fanny: Why would I hang up?
I called you.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.673
- Fanny?
- I need you to open the studio.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.741
- Boo and Carl are waiting to rehearse.
- Now?

12:23.742 --> 12:25.172
You have something
better to do?

12:25.292 --> 12:28.878
- I do. Something important.
- You're an out-of-work showgirl

12:28.879 --> 12:31.127
living in a one-room guest
house behind a dance studio.

12:31.247 --> 12:33.665
- How important could it be?
- I'm next in line for coffee.

12:33.785 --> 12:37.449
- Oh for heaven's sake.
- I've been waiting all morning to get this far.

12:37.569 --> 12:40.089
- Well, Michael and I are at brunch.
- Brunch?

12:40.090 --> 12:41.579
It's a meal between
breakfast and lunch,

12:41.699 --> 12:44.393
most often enjoyed by childless
couples and gay men.

12:44.394 --> 12:47.396
- I know what brunch is.
- They have bottomless mimosas here

12:47.397 --> 12:49.832
- which, frankly, I just see as a challenge.
- You poisoned me.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.967
Now all I can do
is Simon le Bon.

12:51.968 --> 12:54.002
- Am I on speaker?
- Not on purpose.

12:54.003 --> 12:56.475
- How rude. Sorry, Bash.
- Not your fault, Fanny.

12:56.595 --> 12:58.140
- Hanging up now.
- Go unlock--

12:58.141 --> 12:59.708
I really didn't mean to
destroy your art. Again--

12:59.709 --> 13:01.676
- Oooh!
- ( Trophy rolling )

13:05.247 --> 13:06.514
( Thuds )

13:12.054 --> 13:14.316
I am going to need a moment.

13:26.801 --> 13:29.236
- What are you doing?
- Fanny asked me to open the studio.

13:29.237 --> 13:30.829
- Fanny asked me to open the studio!
- Yes.

13:30.949 --> 13:33.791
And then she was afraid you wouldn't do
it, so she asked me to open the studio.

13:33.911 --> 13:36.208
If she didn't trust me, why didn't she
just call you in the first place?

13:36.209 --> 13:37.844
It does seem
the obvious choice.

13:37.845 --> 13:38.973
And if you knew
you were coming,

13:39.093 --> 13:40.714
why couldn't you call me
and tell me not to come?

13:40.834 --> 13:43.637
What if something happened to me en route? I
thought we should be each other's back-ups.

13:43.757 --> 13:46.586
We're not pilots! I was
next in line for coffee.

13:46.587 --> 13:49.187
And not gas-station coffee,
the coffee that takes forever.

13:49.188 --> 13:50.989
Halley's comet went by twice
while I was waiting.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.091
I assume
you're being hyperbolic.

13:53.092 --> 13:55.129
Icebergs formed and melted again
during the time I was in line.

13:55.249 --> 13:58.430
- Definitely hyperbolic.
- The guy in back of me had gills when we started.

13:58.431 --> 14:00.435
Please stop yelling at me.

14:02.368 --> 14:04.268
Hey!
Ready to dance?

14:04.269 --> 14:06.370
I have to change my shoes.

14:06.371 --> 14:08.572
So what are you guys
doing here so early?

14:08.573 --> 14:10.641
We're working on
the Astaire-Rogers dance

14:10.642 --> 14:13.377
- for the opening of the new supermarket.
- Wow. Yay?

14:13.378 --> 14:15.679
It's a premier supermarket
with Chinese takeout,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.582
a donut counter, a coffee place

14:18.583 --> 14:21.818
and an A.T.M.
and stamps.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.287
Okay, it's been a long time
since I was a teenager,

14:24.288 --> 14:26.255
but I'm pretty sure I never got
that excited about a supermarket.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.257
Unless I was making out
behind one.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.092
I guess I'm just looking
forward to the dance part.

14:30.093 --> 14:32.429
Hold that thought.
What are you doing?

14:32.430 --> 14:35.402
- Opening the studio.
- In pioneer times?

14:35.522 --> 14:38.333
This is what I do when I open. I
want it to smell like pumpkin pie

14:38.334 --> 14:40.669
- when Fanny comes in.
- Wow.

14:40.670 --> 14:43.672
Sometimes I light the vanilla candle
and make it pumpkin pie a la mode.

14:43.673 --> 14:45.737
- Speechless.
- It's what I would want someone to do for me.

14:45.857 --> 14:48.977
Okay. Well, I'm here now and the
studio is open, so you're free to go.

14:48.978 --> 14:51.946
Are you gonna
light the candles?

14:51.947 --> 14:55.740
- No.
- Then I guess we know why Fanny called me.

14:58.387 --> 15:01.923
You know, guys, as long as I'm here,
I'm happy to give you some feedback,

15:01.924 --> 15:04.444
- be fresh eyes while you rehearse.
- No.

15:04.564 --> 15:07.733
- You don't have to do that.
- It'll keep my mind off my sad coffeeless state.

15:07.853 --> 15:10.302
- No, we're cool.
- Actually, fresh eyes might be good.

15:10.422 --> 15:12.766
The sooner we get the dance right,
the sooner we can stop rehearsing.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.801
I think Baryshnikov
said the same thing.

15:14.802 --> 15:17.203
Get stretched and we'll start.

15:17.204 --> 15:20.084
( Whispers ) Can I talk
to you for a second?

15:23.677 --> 15:25.811
- What's going on?
- You have to go!

15:25.812 --> 15:27.780
- Something I said?
- I can't compete with the legs,

15:27.781 --> 15:30.115
the hair and
the pretty-without-trying.

15:30.116 --> 15:32.317
- Not following, but thank you.
- It's just...

15:32.318 --> 15:36.010
- I kind of like Carl.
- Like, like him like him?

15:36.529 --> 15:37.590
Yeah, I do.

15:37.591 --> 15:39.864
Sorry to do this again,
but hold on.

15:39.984 --> 15:41.025
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

15:41.026 --> 15:42.660
- Truly!
- I thought Fanny might like

15:42.661 --> 15:44.963
- some fresh-cut flowers when she comes in.
- Go!

15:47.406 --> 15:52.202
- Wow, so you like Carl.
- Yeah, but nobody knows, including him,

15:52.203 --> 15:54.443
so the only time we get to hang
out is when we're rehearsing.

15:54.563 --> 15:57.254
That's why you were hyperventilating
about the supermarket opening.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.031
- Okay, pieces coming together. Consider me gone.
- Thank you.

16:00.151 --> 16:02.417
- Boo, I'm on limited time here!
- Right. Sorry.

16:02.537 --> 16:06.081
Thanks for the girl talk-- I finally
understand what the heck skin toner does.

16:06.082 --> 16:07.884
- See ya.
- Wait, I thought you were helping us.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.819
Well, I could help you, but if
I do all the helping for you,

16:09.820 --> 16:11.557
- what will you learn?
- Huh?

16:11.677 --> 16:14.657
- Teach a man to dance and he eats fish for a lifetime.
- That doesn't make sense.

16:14.658 --> 16:17.727
Nope.
Okay, have fun.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.824
So guess what? I made us those
dream bars I told you about.

16:20.944 --> 16:23.609
I'm not much of a baker, so they
may taste more like nightmare bars--

16:23.729 --> 16:26.434
We're in training. I don't think
we should be having any bars.

16:26.435 --> 16:28.269
- Oh. - And we should probably cut
the chit-chat and get started.

16:28.270 --> 16:29.771
Okay, yeah.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.104
Fanny: You're wasting my time.
Just go.

16:36.444 --> 16:38.445
Go go go.
Go go go go go!

16:38.446 --> 16:41.649
Worthless,
completely worthless.

16:41.650 --> 16:44.151
Look at this. We have our
arms around each other.

16:44.152 --> 16:46.319
They call themselves dancers.
Who taught these girls?

16:46.320 --> 16:48.572
It's me and him,
me and him, me and him!

16:48.692 --> 16:51.525
If I don't find a Clara, there's going
to be no one to give the nutcracker to!

16:51.526 --> 16:53.448
And we're doing
that leaning heads thing.

16:53.568 --> 16:55.815
- You only do leaning heads with friends.
- Is that you?

16:55.935 --> 16:58.130
- Yeah.
- You were pretty.

16:58.131 --> 17:00.733
Not loving the past tense.
That's me and Richard.

17:00.734 --> 17:02.635
- That choreographer?
- Yeah.

17:02.636 --> 17:04.604
- Did you talk to him?
- I left messages,

17:04.605 --> 17:06.705
but he hasn't called me back.
I thought maybe I was

17:06.707 --> 17:08.809
remembering our friendship
wrong, but look-- proof!

17:08.929 --> 17:12.733
- He's probably just busy.
- Too busy to call a friend he leaned heads with?

17:12.853 --> 17:14.913
He's putting on a show.
That's a lot of work.

17:14.914 --> 17:17.214
And I found the receipt
for the rental.

17:17.215 --> 17:19.284
Guess what--
I paid for Martha's vineyard!

17:19.285 --> 17:21.877
I feel for him.
Casting is impossible.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.755
Your situation is not impossible.
There's an easy solution.

17:24.756 --> 17:26.825
- Which is?
- Talk to Sasha.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.594
I'll be happy to talk to her--
after she apologizes to me.

17:29.595 --> 17:32.129
Seriously?
She's 16, you're 100.

17:32.130 --> 17:35.113
- She was in the wrong.
- So be the mature one and go to her.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.759
I'll do no such thing.
It's up to her to come to me.

17:37.879 --> 17:40.604
Okay well, I hope you've stocked
up on water and toilet paper

17:40.724 --> 17:42.038
- because you're in for a long wait.
- ( Twig cracks )

17:42.039 --> 17:43.673
Hold it!

17:46.321 --> 17:49.055
- You could play Clara.
- You know he's a boy, right?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.447
Matthew Bourne did
"Swan Lake" with all boys.

17:51.448 --> 17:52.876
Get in here.

17:59.155 --> 18:01.315
All right, stand
right over there...

18:01.435 --> 18:06.315
Hi, it's Michelle Simms again. I just
thought I'd see if I could catch him.

18:08.081 --> 18:11.533
Still not there. You know, this
show's never gonna get off the ground

18:11.534 --> 18:13.334
if he doesn't start
showing up for work.

18:13.335 --> 18:16.483
Okay well, just tell him
I called and--

18:16.736 --> 18:18.906
Wait, that was him.

18:18.907 --> 18:21.876
No, I just heard his laugh.

18:21.877 --> 18:24.378
Two titters and a snort,
that's definitely Richard.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.148
No, I know his snort, lady!
Trust me.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.283
"Bright Lights, Big City"
was his favorite book.

18:30.284 --> 18:33.453
Okay, you know what?
Forget it.

18:33.454 --> 18:35.789
Tell him not to call me back
and tell him he still owes me

18:35.790 --> 18:37.457
for the Martha's vineyard
rental!

18:37.458 --> 18:39.559
And jump and jump and higher!

18:39.560 --> 18:41.111
Higher!

18:49.704 --> 18:52.315
There's no line.
Seriously?

18:52.435 --> 18:55.012
Seriously there's no line?
All right!

18:55.132 --> 18:57.778
Day officially saved.
I'll take one coffee,

18:57.779 --> 18:59.786
any brew, any bean,
you're the boss.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.409
You sure you don't want
to make a call first?

19:08.529 --> 19:10.708
- Knock anything over?
- Oh good, we're still on that.

19:10.828 --> 19:14.151
- Destroy things that are near and dear to me?
- Again, really sorry.

19:14.271 --> 19:17.108
I have my old archery trophies at home.
You could take a crack at those.

19:17.228 --> 19:19.430
- Archery?
- I could see if my dads are free.

19:19.431 --> 19:21.366
You could hurl some
anti-gay slurs at them.

19:21.486 --> 19:23.201
Okay, aren't I
the customer here?

19:23.321 --> 19:25.695
Yes, and I'm the owner
and the owner's always right.

19:25.815 --> 19:27.426
I'm pretty sure that's
not the expression.

19:27.546 --> 19:29.741
- Who's got the coffee?
- You.

19:29.742 --> 19:31.673
- Who wants the coffee?
- Me.

19:31.793 --> 19:34.447
I don't think we need to be discussing
the power dynamic any further.

19:34.567 --> 19:36.447
Now, why don't you have a seat?

19:36.713 --> 19:39.683
And your coffee should be up
in 10, 15 minutes.

19:39.684 --> 19:41.051
- Seriously?
- Why would I joke?

19:41.052 --> 19:42.869
( Sighs )
I just--

19:42.989 --> 19:45.667
I sort of understood the wait
when the line was down the block.

19:45.787 --> 19:48.671
But I'm the only one here. Couldn't
we maybe speed things up a little?

19:48.791 --> 19:51.747
- I don't see how.
- You could skip the little heart in the foam.

19:51.867 --> 19:54.551
- You want a different design?
- You could skip the design entirely.

19:54.829 --> 19:57.171
- But that's my signature.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.008
It's not my coffee
without the design.

19:59.128 --> 20:01.895
- I'll sign a confidentiality agreement.
- I won a contest you know.

20:02.015 --> 20:04.732
Yes, for making coffee.
You didn't cure cancer

20:04.852 --> 20:07.175
or figure out malaria.
You brew coffee--

20:07.295 --> 20:10.012
and I'm grateful for that, but
let's keep a little perspective.

20:11.948 --> 20:13.119
You know what?
You're right.

20:13.625 --> 20:17.519
Sometimes I get inside my head,
take myself a little too seriously.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.835
Been that way my whole life.
I get it from mom.

20:21.063 --> 20:24.166
- I thought you had two dads.
- We call one of them "mom" so it's not confusing.

20:24.286 --> 20:26.561
- Ah.
- I'll start that coffee for you.

20:26.562 --> 20:28.195
Thank you.

20:31.767 --> 20:34.635
( Whistling )

20:34.636 --> 20:36.437
What are you doing?

20:36.438 --> 20:38.170
- Cleaning the machine.
- Now?

20:38.290 --> 20:40.360
- The light's on.
- I'm begging you.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.793
I'll drink dirty coffee. Don't
make me grow old at this counter.

20:50.851 --> 20:52.467
You're sitting.
Why are you sitting?

20:52.587 --> 20:54.568
- I'm reading the manual.
- Who reads the manual?!

20:54.688 --> 20:57.010
Award-winning baristas.
Oh-oh my God! You know what?

20:57.238 --> 21:00.512
You and I are through, because in a
week we're getting a new supermarket--

21:00.632 --> 21:03.365
a premier supermarket--
where in one fell swoop

21:03.485 --> 21:06.599
I can get garlic chicken and
stamps and a raised glazed donut

21:06.719 --> 21:08.673
and 15 cups of coffee
in five minutes.

21:08.793 --> 21:11.884
And I'll know that coffee will
have my name misspelled on the cup

21:12.004 --> 21:14.856
and world music will inexplicably
be for sale at the register

21:14.976 --> 21:18.299
and no matter where I am, it will look
like Seattle in the '90s and I can't wait!

21:21.947 --> 21:23.581
( Tapping )

21:34.437 --> 21:37.045
And we're dancing.
And we're dancing.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.146
And we're bringing it home.
Sam, home's over here.

21:39.266 --> 21:42.031
To your left. Your other left.
There you go!

21:42.032 --> 21:44.433
Well, they say you
can't go home again.

21:49.006 --> 21:52.014
All right, great class, everybody.
See you next week.

21:53.944 --> 21:55.549
- Hey, Sam, can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

21:55.669 --> 21:57.798
- How long you been taking tap?
- I don't know, two, three years.

21:57.918 --> 21:59.722
- You're not getting any better.
- I know!

21:59.842 --> 22:01.643
- I mean you're truly terrible.
- Right?!

22:01.763 --> 22:05.238
- And you're okay with that?
- I figure improvement breeds expectation.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.893
Expectation breeds
disappointment.

22:07.013 --> 22:09.729
- And disappointment breeds wrinkles.
- Exactly.

22:12.528 --> 22:16.026
- Hey, wow, that looks bad.
- Yeah.

22:16.146 --> 22:18.766
Just so everyone knows, I'm
teaching Fanny's class today.

22:18.767 --> 22:20.034
( Sighs of relief )

22:22.270 --> 22:24.095
Hey, look at that--
a Christmas miracle.

22:24.215 --> 22:26.915
I finished the final fittings
for the supermarket dance.

22:27.035 --> 22:30.346
You just need to steam them and give
them a mist with lavender spray.

22:30.466 --> 22:32.384
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
But they look lovely.

22:32.688 --> 22:36.030
Great! Carl's not here,
but I can take his to him.

22:36.150 --> 22:38.578
Hey, you're not talking about
the new supermarket, are you?

22:38.698 --> 22:40.828
The premier supermarket,
the one that opens

22:40.948 --> 22:43.220
in exactly six days,
eight hours and 47 minutes.

22:43.340 --> 22:45.352
- Yeah, it's not opening.
- What?

22:45.472 --> 22:48.493
Shut that sucker down. We got
them on a zoning technicality.

22:48.494 --> 22:50.095
I'm surprised Fanny
didn't hear about it.

22:50.096 --> 22:51.583
- But the coffee.
- And the dancing.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.507
- The dancing for coffee.
- If I don't dance with Carl,

22:54.627 --> 22:56.317
I'm not going
to see him anymore.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.148
Hey, who got them on
a zoning technicality?

22:58.268 --> 22:59.781
The association
for the preservation

22:59.901 --> 23:02.144
- of keeping it real in paradise.
- That can't be the name.

23:02.264 --> 23:04.759
I know, it's a mouthful. That's
why we call it taft-poki-rip.

23:04.879 --> 23:06.911
- Who can I talk to to undo this?
- You can talk to me.

23:07.139 --> 23:09.113
- I'm on the committee.
- Great. Undo this.

23:09.233 --> 23:11.505
- Nope. See you next week.
- Okay, seriously, Sam.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.303
There's got to be
something I can do here--

23:13.423 --> 23:15.803
file a grievance or pass a
motion or gather a posse.

23:15.923 --> 23:17.188
I don't know.
Read the handbook.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.188
I'm hungry, my feet hurt,
I want to go home.

23:19.308 --> 23:21.321
People have been really looking
forward to that place opening.

23:21.441 --> 23:24.714
- What people?
- Well... her.

23:24.834 --> 23:27.562
Bambi eyes.
Bambi eyes.

23:29.733 --> 23:31.066
She'll get over it.

23:33.828 --> 23:36.144
I'm not going to let it happen.
Hear me, boo?

23:36.264 --> 23:39.967
- Fight the good fight.
- They are not taking Khaleesi's dragons!

23:40.443 --> 23:42.910
Cheerleaders:
We're gonna b-e-a-t,

23:42.911 --> 23:46.214
we're gonna b-u-s-t,

23:46.215 --> 23:48.472
we're gonna beat them,
bust them, that's our custom.

23:48.592 --> 23:51.285
Come on, pirates,
let's readjust them!

23:51.286 --> 23:53.320
- Go-ooooo pirates!
- Whooo!

23:56.424 --> 23:58.127
- Uh, Sasha?
- Yeah.

23:58.247 --> 24:00.431
We talked about this. I need
you to not kick so high,

24:00.551 --> 24:02.115
because the rest of us
can't do it, 'kay?

24:02.235 --> 24:05.270
I swear I'm trying. Believe it or
not, this is a low kick for me.

24:05.390 --> 24:08.101
Yeah well, as head cheerleader, I
determine the official kick height.

24:08.102 --> 24:10.006
And this is it.

24:10.126 --> 24:12.057
So it's really more
of a half kick?

24:12.177 --> 24:14.678
We need to be uniform
or someone could stand out.

24:14.798 --> 24:17.817
- Well, I will try harder to be mediocre.
- Thank you.

24:20.042 --> 24:23.649
- No way.
- Look at you with the ponytails and the pep.

24:23.769 --> 24:25.978
- I didn't know you guys were coming.
- I count six.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.753
- What?
- Pom poms. You're wearing six pom poms.

24:27.754 --> 24:29.465
That we can see.

24:29.585 --> 24:31.655
- They make us wear this.
- It's cute.

24:31.775 --> 24:34.318
I can't believe all these people
are here watching you cheer.

24:34.438 --> 24:37.361
Okay, we're only 10 minutes late.
How is it already 47-2?

24:37.362 --> 24:39.168
- Do we suck?
- Apparently.

24:39.288 --> 24:41.866
If you'd told me you were coming, I
would've told you not to bother.

24:41.867 --> 24:43.835
Sasha!
We're making a pyramid!

24:43.836 --> 24:45.203
- Gotta go.
- Let's get snacks.

24:45.204 --> 24:46.236
- You're going to stay?
- Of course.

24:46.237 --> 24:48.660
Oh. Super.

24:49.707 --> 24:51.606
Go team!

24:56.592 --> 24:59.313
I can't believe we're wasting our
Friday night at a basketball game.

24:59.433 --> 25:01.484
- We're doing it for Sasha.
- The Sasha part is fun.

25:01.485 --> 25:03.552
But the rest is still
a basketball game.

25:03.553 --> 25:05.069
Which is why we have junk food.
To keep us distracted

25:05.189 --> 25:06.702
for however long
a basketball game is.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.193
- ( Carl talking )
- Oh.

25:10.194 --> 25:12.094
- What?
- ( Girl laughs )

25:12.095 --> 25:13.618
Ginny: Oh, what are
they laughing at?

25:13.738 --> 25:15.745
Maybe he admitted he lives
in a tree, making cookies.

25:15.865 --> 25:18.233
- He's such a loser.
- He's not that bad.

25:18.234 --> 25:20.709
- Hey, who has my nachos?
- Charlie: Hey.

25:21.537 --> 25:22.904
- Go away. What?
- Move over.

25:22.905 --> 25:25.207
Move!

25:25.208 --> 25:28.509
- What are-- what are you doing?
- What do you think?

25:28.510 --> 25:31.446
- Watching the game.
- We're not Gyllenhaals.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.348
- Are you stealing from my bag?
- Why, do you have something good in there?

25:34.349 --> 25:36.616
Ginny, your nachos-- they're not
going to be safe over here.

25:36.617 --> 25:38.518
- Those aren't mine.
- Yes, they are.

25:38.519 --> 25:40.181
They're the disgusting ones
with extra cheese and ketchup.

25:40.301 --> 25:42.732
- No, I don't eat nachos.
- You just asked me for them.

25:42.852 --> 25:46.260
- No, I didn't.
- I'll take them.

25:46.261 --> 25:48.528
So I didn't know you
liked basketball.

25:48.529 --> 25:51.012
Uh-huh, it's got
baskets and balls.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.968
- Seriously, stop breathing.
- I'll die.

25:54.969 --> 25:55.981
Yes, exactly.

25:58.939 --> 26:01.207
You're really into the game.

26:01.208 --> 26:04.010
I'm watching Sasha cheer.
Yay, Sasha!

26:04.011 --> 26:05.444
( Buzzer sounds )

26:12.551 --> 26:16.521
Hi, hello and how do you do?

26:16.522 --> 26:20.492
We are the pirates.
We welcome you.

26:20.493 --> 26:24.195
My name is Aubrey.
I live to cheer.

26:24.196 --> 26:28.766
With me in town
you'll have no fear!

26:28.767 --> 26:31.102
My name is Sasha.
I-- ( Coughing )

26:33.302 --> 26:35.416
- Think she's okay?
- Probably just a bug.

26:35.536 --> 26:38.375
- Like she's sick?
- No, moron, like she swallowed a bug.

26:38.376 --> 26:40.210
Sasha:
You go ahead, go ahead.

26:40.211 --> 26:43.060
When I was five,
I swallowed a bug in Aruba.

26:43.180 --> 26:46.883
I freaked out so much my parents gave
me a pina colada just to shut up.

26:46.884 --> 26:48.484
I like coconuts.

26:51.095 --> 26:53.804
- What were you saying, boo?
- I didn't say anything.

26:53.924 --> 26:57.570
Boo, start talking! We never get to talk any more.
What's going on with boo?

26:57.690 --> 27:01.030
- I don't know.
- That's hilarious!

27:01.031 --> 27:03.202
- God, you are so funny.
- I'll be right back.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.100
No, boo!

27:05.101 --> 27:08.093
Come back, boo.

27:08.473 --> 27:12.240
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's great. I just--

27:12.241 --> 27:14.809
- I have to go.
- You getting more food?

27:14.810 --> 27:16.492
No, definitely not
getting more food.

27:16.612 --> 27:20.014
Or going to the bathroom.
I don't-- do that.

27:20.015 --> 27:22.984
- Oh my God, Ginny! Did you push her?
- I didn't touch her!

27:22.985 --> 27:25.784
- I'm okay!
- Let me help you back up.

27:25.904 --> 27:29.923
No, I'll just go this way since
I'm already heading down...

27:33.761 --> 27:36.092
- Hey, whatcha doin'?
- Just promoting team spirit.

27:36.212 --> 27:40.167
Cool cool. So did you have to
audition to become a cheerleader?

27:40.168 --> 27:42.174
Yeah, it's not like Harvard.
You don't get born into it.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.706
- That's so interesting.
- Is it?

27:48.541 --> 27:50.977
So what's your favorite
thing about cheering?

27:50.978 --> 27:52.625
- We're really doing this?
- Why not?

27:52.745 --> 27:56.115
Okay, what's going on? Why the
sudden interest in all things cheer?

27:56.116 --> 27:58.291
Uh, Sasha?
We talked about this.

27:58.411 --> 28:01.219
No fraternizing with the
fans while cheering, 'kay?

28:01.220 --> 28:03.276
- Sorry.
- Victory cheer, everyone.

28:03.396 --> 28:05.782
- Are you serious?
- No, it's a big joke.

28:05.902 --> 28:09.393
We're down a million to four. Victory
is a mathematical impossibility.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.957
- We need to motivate them.
- How about we cheer "Stay in school,

28:12.077 --> 28:14.143
learn algebra, you have
no future in sports"?

28:14.263 --> 28:16.700
- That's not motivational.
- We'll throw in "Hey hey" at the end.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.786
- But--
- This is the problem with men today.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.750
They go straight from sports-- where
we tell them they can do anything--

28:22.870 --> 28:25.617
out into the cruel hard world
where clearly they can't.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.111
And they have no coping skills,
so they walk around

28:28.231 --> 28:30.946
the rest of their lives confused,
stunned as to what happened.

28:30.947 --> 28:32.829
They were supposed to be
lords of the universe,

28:32.949 --> 28:35.506
not wearing a fake referee's
outfit at the local Footlocker.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.988
So they drink and get fat
and die of a stroke at 46

28:39.108 --> 28:41.924
all because we jumped around
yelling "Yay team,"

28:41.925 --> 28:44.507
instead of letting them feel
like the failures that they are.

28:49.665 --> 28:52.467
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:52.468 --> 28:55.670
I wasn't sure if you heard
about the supermarket opening.

28:55.671 --> 28:58.806
- It's not happening.
- Oh, you heard.

28:58.807 --> 29:01.209
- Fanny called me.
- I didn't know that.

29:01.210 --> 29:03.644
She did.

29:03.645 --> 29:06.247
Well, it's too bad no one's
going to see our dance.

29:06.248 --> 29:09.256
Maybe madame Fanny can find a
different place for us to perform it.

29:09.376 --> 29:12.180
- I think my dancing days are over.
- What?

29:12.623 --> 29:16.373
I'm busy with school. And let's
be honest, I'm not that good.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.735
- That's not true.
- Boo, please.

29:18.855 --> 29:21.356
It's a miracle
you're not on crutch.

29:23.130 --> 29:24.818
Well, maybe I'll see you
at a game sometime.

29:24.938 --> 29:27.718
Probably not. I just came tonight
to get extra credit for P.E.

29:28.009 --> 29:29.136
Oh.

29:30.804 --> 29:33.039
- ( Whistle blows )
- I'd better pay attention to the game.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.674
- Coach Meyer will quiz me.
- Okay.

29:35.675 --> 29:38.497
Well, see you around.

29:58.639 --> 30:00.840
Yo, pretty boy!
Spread the word--

30:00.960 --> 30:03.688
we're having a meeting to oppose
the closing of the supermarket

30:03.808 --> 30:06.022
tomorrow night at 8:00
at Fanny's dance studio.

30:06.142 --> 30:09.248
It's all on the flyer. Which,
B-T-Dubs, is where you come in.

30:09.249 --> 30:11.283
I need your help
in getting the word out,

30:11.284 --> 30:13.034
so no one leaves here
without one of these puppies.

30:13.154 --> 30:16.054
Buy a drink, get a flyer.
Order an appetizer, get a flyer.

30:16.055 --> 30:18.323
Go to the bathroom, get a whole
stack of flyers. Got it?

30:18.324 --> 30:19.849
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm Michelle.

30:19.969 --> 30:23.405
Vegas dancer, married Hubbell, sex at the
party, car crash-- it was in all the papers.

30:23.525 --> 30:26.019
- I don't read the paper.
- Right, because it's not 1950.

30:26.139 --> 30:28.348
All good things
happen outside a paper.

30:28.468 --> 30:30.941
You ever seen a baby deer
born in the paper?

30:31.169 --> 30:33.279
- Uh...
- Only way a baby deer is in the paper

30:33.399 --> 30:35.343
is if it causes a pile-up.
You read the paper,

30:35.463 --> 30:37.540
you'd think all
baby deers were killers.

30:37.541 --> 30:39.468
- That's nuts.
- If the truth is nuts--

30:39.588 --> 30:42.057
I promise you, no baby
deers die in these flyers.

30:42.177 --> 30:45.283
- Cool. - I'm just trying to save 
the supermarket-- and the coffee.

30:45.403 --> 30:47.117
- Right on.
- So I decided to go "Footloose"

30:47.237 --> 30:49.319
on the committee's ass
and call a meeting.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.661
- ( Cellphone buzzing )
- Ooh, I'm buzzing.

30:52.956 --> 30:55.346
Hello.
Oh hi, Mr. Mortimer.

30:55.466 --> 30:58.173
Thanks for calling me back.
Yes, that is correct,

30:58.293 --> 31:00.400
we are holding a dinner
in your honor.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.003
90 years on this planet
is nothing to sneeze at.

31:03.123 --> 31:05.868
Tomorrow night at 8:00
at Fanny's dance studio.

31:05.869 --> 31:07.837
Did you want
the chicken or fish?

31:07.838 --> 31:09.508
Great, see you then.

31:12.343 --> 31:15.145
- Wow.
- Oh, like he's gonna know the difference.

31:15.265 --> 31:17.759
You ever try to save a supermarket?
You do what it takes.

31:17.879 --> 31:19.202
- That's nuts.
- I know.

31:19.322 --> 31:21.589
- No, like seriously crazy.
- You don't have to tell me.

31:21.709 --> 31:24.425
I lived in Vegas. I played craps
with Dennis Rodman. I know crazy.

31:26.047 --> 31:28.541
Okay, so I've got
to hit the synagogue,

31:28.661 --> 31:31.624
tell them about the bris we're having
tomorrow night at 8:00. But remember--

31:32.768 --> 31:34.361
No one leaves here
without a flyer.

31:36.931 --> 31:39.181
You didn't give me a flyer.
I hope you get better at this.

31:44.918 --> 31:47.330
Okay, so I was thinking tonight
we'd go for a snack theme

31:47.450 --> 31:48.822
of things on top
of related things.

31:48.942 --> 31:50.821
What, like whipped cream
on ice cream?

31:50.941 --> 31:53.289
Amateur hour. I've got cookie
dough to put on cookies

31:53.409 --> 31:55.454
and soft cheese
to spread on hard cheese.

31:55.574 --> 31:58.350
- I'm not really hungry.
- What are you doing?

31:58.351 --> 32:00.376
This is the taking-off
portion of the evening.

32:00.496 --> 32:02.220
- Why aren't you changed?
- I'm comfortable.

32:03.086 --> 32:04.656
Ugh, get out!

32:04.776 --> 32:08.445
- Like I want to stay.
- We're getting beer. You want anything?

32:08.565 --> 32:10.698
Uh, we're not
bringing her anything.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.230
- Ginny can have something.
- No thanks.

32:13.350 --> 32:15.268
I'm not much of a drinker.
Or eater.

32:15.388 --> 32:17.567
I don't really ingest.
That's not mine.

32:17.568 --> 32:19.852
All right.
Later.

32:23.446 --> 32:25.319
See, this is why we should've
set up in my room.

32:25.439 --> 32:27.945
Maybe we can change the locks
before they get back.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.233
- ( Door closes )
- What the hell.

32:30.353 --> 32:33.449
- What?
- Okay, freak, what's going on with you?

32:33.450 --> 32:35.637
You've been acting 50 shades
of cray-cray lately.

32:35.757 --> 32:39.456
I know! I can't think or talk and
my stomach hurts all the time.

32:39.576 --> 32:41.773
And I don't know why, but I borrowed my
mother's nightgown from her honeymoon

32:41.893 --> 32:44.598
just in case he'd see me in it and
I don't even think it'll fit.

32:44.718 --> 32:47.731
She's 15 times taller than me, and ever
since I found out Charlie likes me,

32:47.851 --> 32:50.287
- nothing I do makes sense.
- Charlie?

32:50.629 --> 32:54.908
- My brother Charlie?
- He asked boo about me and now my brain is 95% empty.

32:55.028 --> 32:57.528
I seriously cannot
form words when he's around.

32:57.648 --> 33:00.304
All that happens in my head
is me going, "Talk talk talk."

33:00.424 --> 33:03.257
But the more I think that, the more I
realize I haven't actually said anything.

33:03.377 --> 33:05.812
And then I end up giggling
and occasionally drooling.

33:05.932 --> 33:08.913
I can't do this. I can't be always
interesting and never hungry.

33:09.033 --> 33:11.789
It makes me want Josh back.
'Cause at least I could eat

33:11.909 --> 33:13.884
and speak and wear
comfortable pants!

33:14.921 --> 33:17.927
- Wait, are you saying you want to date Charlie?
- That's not the point!

33:18.047 --> 33:20.460
The point is I'm acting
like a mental patient!

33:20.461 --> 33:22.862
No, the point is
you can't date Charlie.

33:22.863 --> 33:24.200
- What?
- Boo likes Charlie.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.288
- I know.
- That means as long as you're friends,

33:26.408 --> 33:28.529
you cannot go near him.
It's bra code.

33:28.649 --> 33:32.007
- But Charlie doesn't like boo.
- It doesn't matter! She owns the rights.

33:32.127 --> 33:35.804
Maybe if boo becomes a nun or a lesbian,
then you could consider liking Charlie.

33:35.924 --> 33:38.437
But only with her permission and
there still might be some blowback.

33:38.557 --> 33:42.487
So "moonstruck" yourself, do what
you gotta do, but this stops now.

33:44.017 --> 33:45.392
Where are you going?

33:45.512 --> 33:47.619
To get sweats and a big
t-shirt for you to sleep in!

34:00.543 --> 34:02.649
It hasn't started yet?
I was sure I was late.

34:02.769 --> 34:05.455
- Why are you dressed like that?
- For the "Sound of Music" sing-along.

34:05.575 --> 34:08.170
- I'm Brigitta.
- It's a neighborhood council meeting.

34:08.290 --> 34:11.045
- A what?
- Michelle suckered us all into coming with a web of lies.

34:11.166 --> 34:14.087
- You're kidding.
- That couple over there is waiting for a bris.

34:14.088 --> 34:15.728
Guy over there is expecting
a bachelor party.

34:15.849 --> 34:17.792
And she told us we were going
to Skype with Hugh Jackman.

34:17.911 --> 34:20.487
- Okay, why would you think that was true?
- She said they were friends.

34:20.607 --> 34:23.891
- And you believed her?
- Yeah, how could we be so dumb, Brigitta?

34:25.900 --> 34:29.266
Mr. Mortimer, you don't
look a day over 85.

34:29.387 --> 34:30.869
Your snapper will be
ready any minute.

34:34.408 --> 34:37.176
- So where is everybody?
- Right here.

34:37.177 --> 34:39.579
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you got a great turnout.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.243
This is a great turnout?

34:41.362 --> 34:44.293
- It's packed.
- Wow, I am so not Kevin Bacon right now.

34:44.414 --> 34:46.454
- Glad I didn't bring my Bible.
- We should get started.

34:46.574 --> 34:49.014
Sure. So what do I need to do?
Is there, like, a gavel

34:49.134 --> 34:51.179
or a gong or Ed McMahon
waiting in the wings?

34:51.444 --> 34:53.993
We're starting! Now why
the hell are we here?

34:54.112 --> 34:55.520
- Man: Bingo!
- Woman: Free puppies!

34:55.639 --> 34:58.183
- Melanie: "Sound of Music" sing-along!
- Okay, hi.

34:58.303 --> 35:01.020
I'm Michelle Simms
and I've called this meeting

35:01.140 --> 35:05.181
because your committee is blocking
the opening of the new supermarket,

35:05.301 --> 35:07.413
and I for one think
this is a mistake.

35:07.533 --> 35:11.105
Right now the only option we have for our
grocery needs is that hole-in-the-wall,

35:11.225 --> 35:15.090
wants-to-be-a-real-store-when- it-grows-up
Joe's market which, let's be honest,

35:15.210 --> 35:17.976
it's not just tiny, it's a little
creepy, with the weird lighting

35:18.096 --> 35:20.305
and dusty shelves and always
smelling like bug spray.

35:20.425 --> 35:22.558
Makes you wonder
what kind of weirdo Joe is.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.589
- I'm Joe.
- Oh.

35:26.590 --> 35:29.025
Uh, you have a lovely market.

35:29.026 --> 35:31.464
I'm simply suggesting

35:31.584 --> 35:33.996
we could also use a store with
more than one kind of mustard.

35:34.116 --> 35:36.553
- Maybe grainy or--
- Nope, nothing grainy.

35:36.673 --> 35:39.958
I don't want any of that fancy
stuff they pass from limo to limo.

35:40.078 --> 35:42.738
- But--
- Golden-- that's the mustard for me.

35:42.739 --> 35:44.616
- ( All agreeing )
- Right.

35:45.652 --> 35:50.551
Then what about convenience? Right
now if you want a bottle of wine

35:50.671 --> 35:52.950
with dinner, you have to go
from Joe's lovely market

35:53.070 --> 35:55.140
all the way across town
to the liquor store.

35:55.260 --> 35:57.638
Yeah, and so do the kids
trying to buy beer.

35:57.758 --> 36:00.176
This way they're either deterred
or they get some exercise.

36:00.296 --> 36:04.056
Let me just cut to the chase. The people
of paradise deserve a good cup of coffee.

36:04.176 --> 36:05.815
- We got that barista.
- Bash.

36:05.935 --> 36:08.318
- He won awards.
- He killed the Italians and the French.

36:08.438 --> 36:11.457
- I heard he even beat a guy from Seattle.
- That's a myth,

36:11.577 --> 36:13.505
just like Sasquatch or Rogaine.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.227
No one beats
the Seattle baristas.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.820
Joe: I saw the trophy
with my own eyes.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.871
Okay yes, he's a very
talented barista.

36:18.991 --> 36:21.023
But I'd like my coffee
before I drop dead.

36:21.143 --> 36:23.265
I don't know what to tell you.
We don't have a problem with it.

36:23.385 --> 36:26.720
No, what you have
a problem with is progress.

36:27.670 --> 36:29.314
That's what this is.

36:29.315 --> 36:32.017
You're scared...

36:32.018 --> 36:34.853
Scared of the big store
coming in

36:34.854 --> 36:37.622
and threatening
your one-mustard town.

36:37.623 --> 36:40.591
You say you got them
on a zoning technicality?

36:40.592 --> 36:42.672
I say that's code for fear.

36:43.027 --> 36:44.925
We don't care about
the zoning thing.

36:45.045 --> 36:47.098
We've been fighting
this battle for years.

36:47.218 --> 36:49.420
That was just
the legal mumbo-jumbo

36:49.540 --> 36:51.078
that let us finally
pull the plug on it.

36:51.198 --> 36:54.338
- This project's bad news.
- Well, nothing's perfect.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.273
Sometimes there
are trade-offs.

36:56.274 --> 36:57.439
They want to pollute the river.

36:57.559 --> 36:58.975
The study said in three years

36:59.095 --> 37:02.045
there'll be nothing
but two-headed fish.

37:02.046 --> 37:03.725
Well, two heads
are better than one.

37:03.845 --> 37:07.643
- Don't forget the ducks.
- Every duck within a 50-mile radius-- dead.

37:07.763 --> 37:11.287
Except the ones that fly off and infect
all the ducks in the United States.

37:11.288 --> 37:13.654
Dead ducks from coast to coast.

37:13.774 --> 37:16.325
Well, on the surface
that sounds bad,

37:16.326 --> 37:17.983
but on the other hand--
coffee.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.148
They also use five year olds
to pick their vegetables.

37:20.268 --> 37:22.764
Why do you hate kids and ducks?

37:22.765 --> 37:25.700
( Crowd murmuring )

37:25.701 --> 37:27.234
I'll be right back.

37:36.245 --> 37:38.326
- Hey.
- I got your message.

37:38.446 --> 37:41.794
Good. Good to know
technology can be trusted.

37:43.451 --> 37:45.586
So are you expecting me
to say something?

37:45.587 --> 37:46.914
Because you're the one
who called this meeting.

37:47.034 --> 37:49.344
Yes, and I thank you
for coming.

37:49.623 --> 37:54.135
That sounded weird. Actually
everything with us is weird lately.

37:54.255 --> 37:57.041
Good thing there's no "us" any
more since the dance was canceled.

37:57.383 --> 37:59.788
And apparently, you're just
interested in me as a dance partner.

37:59.908 --> 38:01.883
- That's not true.
- That's what your friends said.

38:02.003 --> 38:04.326
- My friends were wrong.
- Your friends were jerks

38:04.446 --> 38:06.549
about me making you lasagna
and you didn't disagree.

38:06.669 --> 38:08.351
Lasagna really does make me
sick to my stomach,

38:08.471 --> 38:11.478
so that part was true. But not
the other stuff they said.

38:12.174 --> 38:14.295
I don't know why I didn't
say anything right then,

38:14.415 --> 38:16.270
but you have to believe me,

38:16.726 --> 38:19.951
I don't want to just be
dance partners.

38:19.952 --> 38:22.616
I like--

38:31.563 --> 38:33.472
- See, she's with Carl!
- So?

38:33.592 --> 38:35.535
- So she doesn't like Charlie any more!
- That's not the point.

38:35.655 --> 38:38.786
- You still can't date Charlie!
- What are you talking about? You're dating Charlie?

38:38.906 --> 38:40.938
- No, not yet.
- Not ever!

38:40.939 --> 38:42.750
- You said you didn't like him.
- I didn't.

38:42.870 --> 38:45.168
- Now she does.
- You know how I feel about Charlie.

38:45.288 --> 38:47.099
- Melanie: That's what I said.
- I've liked him forever.

38:47.219 --> 38:48.985
- I know!
- You said you wouldn't date him.

38:49.105 --> 38:51.374
You told me to my face "It's not
like I'd date him or anything."

38:51.494 --> 38:53.184
- I was there.
- Total violation of bra code.

38:53.304 --> 38:55.294
- Ginny: Look, I haven't even gone out with him yet.
- "Yet"!

38:55.414 --> 38:57.932
- Obviously, you want to.
- Ginny: You were the one who told me he liked me.

38:58.052 --> 39:01.401
Because I thought I could trust you
not to go after the guy I like!

39:01.521 --> 39:03.122
I'm sorry, I just caught
you kissing someone.

39:03.242 --> 39:05.690
You can't own Shorty McShorterson
and every other guy in the world!

39:05.810 --> 39:07.431
- It's not fair.
- Life's not fair.

39:07.551 --> 39:09.822
Oh, so wise!
So tall and so so wise!

39:09.942 --> 39:11.582
Hey, I'm just standing
up for my friend!

39:11.702 --> 39:15.223
- She wouldn't do this to you, right, boo?
- I'm an idiot.

39:19.296 --> 39:20.726
I'll never have coffee again.

39:20.846 --> 39:21.701
Come on!

39:21.941 --> 39:24.909
I'll miss coffee. It smells good.
It makes you talk fast.

39:24.910 --> 39:28.212
It goes nicely with cake and pie
and all your basic baked goods.

39:28.213 --> 39:30.781
Yeah, I'm not really much
of a coffee person myself.

39:30.782 --> 39:32.615
So why'd you come
to the meeting?

39:33.324 --> 39:34.885
I had a feeling that

39:34.886 --> 39:36.754
you might not get
much of a turnout,

39:36.755 --> 39:38.657
thought you could
use some back up.

39:38.777 --> 39:42.259
Oh, a boy scout, huh? Helping
an old lady across the street?

39:42.260 --> 39:44.981
- I like your shirt.
- Thanks.

39:45.101 --> 39:48.209
- What's it mean?
- That you're even younger than I realized.

39:49.333 --> 39:53.317
You have a whole "old" thing
going on tonight, huh?

39:53.437 --> 39:56.275
- Let me take that.
- This was dumb.

39:56.395 --> 40:00.203
- This whole thing was dumb.
- Someone your age should've known better.

40:00.323 --> 40:03.879
I guess I just wanted to feel
like I had some kind of control

40:03.880 --> 40:05.543
over something in my life,
you know?

40:07.645 --> 40:10.018
Nothing is under your control.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.954
You just gotta let
things happen.

40:12.955 --> 40:15.793
Yeah, okay, surfer boy,
get back to me in 10 years,

40:15.913 --> 40:18.426
- we'll see how you're doing with that.
- It's not about age.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.900
- It's about philosophy.
- Well, here's my philosophy:

40:21.020 --> 40:22.897
I believe
in controlling everything.

40:22.898 --> 40:26.133
And putting cheese on stuff.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.769
- You need to go surfing.
- Yes, that is exactly what I need.

40:28.770 --> 40:30.846
- I could take you.
- Absolutely, pick me up at noon.

40:30.966 --> 40:34.007
Once I got you out on the
waves, you'd let all this go.

40:34.008 --> 40:36.523
You'd surrender to the ocean.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.935
Wow, that is an awesome line.

40:39.055 --> 40:42.757
And I bet with your face and other
parts that it works-- a lot.

40:42.877 --> 40:44.144
- How about tomorrow?
- No.

40:44.145 --> 40:45.173
- Next day?
- No.

40:45.293 --> 40:47.262
"No" is really just
another way of saying "yes."

40:47.382 --> 40:51.116
You're adorable. And I love the
flirting thing you've got going here,

40:51.117 --> 40:53.686
but you and I--
really different.

40:53.687 --> 40:56.121
That combo could
seriously never happen.

40:56.122 --> 40:57.823
We'll see.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.036
( Scoffs )

41:12.638 --> 41:15.339
Hey.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.841
- Hey.
- Why aren't you out there?

41:16.842 --> 41:20.010
I sprained my spirit.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.998
- They don't kick very high, do they?
- No.

41:22.118 --> 41:24.194
- But they're uniform.
- You're right.

41:24.314 --> 41:26.850
- They all kick the same unimpressive height.
- ( School bell ringing )

41:26.851 --> 41:28.936
All right,
what are you doing here?

41:29.056 --> 41:31.709
Dressed like that?
With the punky Brewster hair?

41:34.491 --> 41:36.529
- Just go apologize to Fanny.
- Can't.

41:36.649 --> 41:38.967
If you can't do it for yourself,
do it for your friends.

41:39.087 --> 41:41.537
They're dying. Half the
class is out with P.T.S.D.

41:41.657 --> 41:43.849
- The other half wishes they were.
- It's not that simple.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.764
Really? 'Cause it doesn't
seem that complicated.

41:45.884 --> 41:49.625
I've got stuff I'm dealing with.
You wouldn't understand.

41:50.537 --> 41:53.208
When I was growing up, my homelife
was no big picnic either.

41:53.209 --> 41:54.846
It was like
a Tennessee Williams play,

41:54.966 --> 41:56.878
but without all the happy endings.
So I get it.

41:56.998 --> 41:59.891
You've got, what? Two more years
till you're out of the house.

42:00.011 --> 42:03.247
And this summer you're at Joffrey, so
that's really two years minus a summer.

42:03.367 --> 42:06.821
That's nothing. You've
just got to suck it up.

42:06.822 --> 42:10.083
Be tougher. Life is
unfair, deal with it.

42:13.333 --> 42:16.383
Look, I have no doubt you can keep the
stubborn thing up for a long time.

42:16.503 --> 42:18.966
I respect your commitment
to the sulk.

42:18.967 --> 42:21.123
But I can tell you
from experience,

42:21.243 --> 42:24.137
one really stupid mistake when
you're young can change everything,

42:24.138 --> 42:26.768
take away options,
make you sorry

42:26.888 --> 42:28.675
you didn't listen to the person who
has a really embarrassing picture

42:28.676 --> 42:30.376
- of you on her cellphone.
- What?

42:30.377 --> 42:31.978
- ( Clicks )
- Nice.

42:31.979 --> 42:33.446
Oh, that's a keeper.

42:36.717 --> 42:38.618
Quitting ballet now is
a really stupid mistake.

42:45.232 --> 42:48.282
- Michelle: Are those jumps?
- It's sad when you have to ask.

42:48.402 --> 42:50.996
Seriously, did they learn them in
a room with really low ceilings?

43:25.984 --> 43:37.634
