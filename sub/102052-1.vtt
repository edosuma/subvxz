00:20.520 --> 00:22.897
[Layton] <i>On the eve</i>
<i>of our 19th revolution,</i>

00:23.898 --> 00:26.609
<i>the great Mr. Wilford</i>
<i>came out of the cold.</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.200
<i>It was the time of two engines,</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:38.288
<i>the Tail no longer the Tail</i>
<i>but a borderland.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:47.380
<i>A time of great gamesmanship</i>
<i>and great trainsmanship,</i>

00:48.965 --> 00:53.303
<i>of revolutions interrupted</i>
<i>and fresh track on new terrain.</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:57.348
Javi, do you copy?

01:00.310 --> 01:02.312
Javi? Shit.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.649
If you can hear me,
switch to backup radio.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.151
I'm going to the connector.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.738
[Layton] <i>Hope was our only seedling,</i>

01:11.821 --> 01:14.991
<i>in the war of</i> Big Alice, <i>40 cars long,</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:19.954
<i>versus</i> Snowpiercer, <i>994 cars strong.</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:23.041
[theme music playing]

01:39.057 --> 01:39.891
[panting]

01:42.352 --> 01:43.186
[grunts]

01:47.607 --> 01:49.943
<i>Snowpiercer</i> is dead in the water.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.195
You will comply
with Mr. Wilford's demands,

01:52.278 --> 01:54.280
or we'll disconnect
and leave you here to flounder.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.867
Tell Mr. Wilford the people
of <i>Snowpiercer</i> will never surrender.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.910
Who are you?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.954
I'm the guy
whose backdoor you just kicked in.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.373
I'm sure that we can all
accommodate one another.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.791
Mr. Layton means no disrespect.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.876
We can discuss when we're moving.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.754
That sounds reasonable, Alex.
Your mother would agree, I'm sure.

02:10.421 --> 02:13.716
-[Roche] How do we make that happen?
-Bring me everything on this list.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.180
Beer?

02:19.264 --> 02:22.142
-[Roche] "Carrots, cucumbers."
-[Ruth] We have to get all this?

02:22.809 --> 02:23.643
[all gasp]

02:24.269 --> 02:27.313
You have about 12 minutes
before it's too cold to move.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.982
Hey!

02:29.065 --> 02:31.901
-It's trifles.
-[Layton] We don't have a choice.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.028
[Till] Hardlines are down
and the subtrain.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.156
[Layton] We gotta do this by runner.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.324
From the brewery,
we need six bottles Railman's Ale.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.367
[man] On it! Make way!

02:39.450 --> 02:42.871
From the library, somebody get
a copy of <i>Rebecca</i> by Daphne du Maurier.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.165
Ruth, you're with me.
Roche, hold the line.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.457
-Ag-Sec!
-[woman] Here!

02:46.541 --> 02:50.753
Till, go with. We need one bunch carrots,
one cucumber, six eggs and a hen.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.255
-[Till] A hen? [grunts]
-[Layton] Yeah.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.799
Javi, have you got comms with Mel?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.509
-We're stopped.
-I got that.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.803
-Have you got comms with her?
-No.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.805
Wilford's got
complete control of <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:03.099
She'll know. She'll know to go to backup.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.606
[Melanie panting]

03:11.274 --> 03:14.152
[Bennett] <i>Melanie,</i>
<i>come in, this is the Engine.</i>

03:14.235 --> 03:15.528
[breathing heavily]

03:15.612 --> 03:17.030
Beautiful day out here.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.621
Yeah, a balmy 118 below zero.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.915
<i>Let's get you back aboard.</i>

03:26.998 --> 03:30.627
[Melanie] I'm at the connector.
The arms are locked in.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.380
-[Javi] <i>Hey, Mel, you can't disconnect us.</i>
-[Melanie] I know.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.925
We drained the banks too low,
running from him,

03:37.634 --> 03:39.636
to ever get moving on our own again.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.057
<i>You were right, Ben. I fell for it.</i>

03:46.809 --> 03:48.436
If I blow the uplink,

03:48.519 --> 03:51.189
at least you get the helm
and life systems back.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.816
You've got a sticky charge, yeah?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.403
Yeah. I only have one.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.491
[Javi] <i>Hey, Mel, what's your suit temp?</i>

04:04.244 --> 04:06.204
[Bennett] <i>You'll be</i>
<i>going hypothermic now, Mel.</i>

04:06.287 --> 04:07.121
[Melanie] Yeah.

04:08.873 --> 04:09.999
Mel?

04:11.501 --> 04:12.877
[Melanie grunts]

04:26.140 --> 04:28.268
-[Lights] Minus ten.
-[Roche] Everybody, stay ready.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.519
Keep your hands warm.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.062
[Winnie] Something's happening.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.606
It's just your train legs.
We've never stopped before.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.567
-No. Listen. I hear something.
-[metal clanks]

04:37.485 --> 04:39.028
Hey, everyone, quiet a second.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.447
[metal clanking]

04:41.531 --> 04:44.993
-Shit! Someone's outside.
-Do you think it's one of us?

04:45.076 --> 04:48.288
I got a hunch it is.
Whatever they're doing, I hope it works.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.708
-Minus 12.
-Tell those runners to hurry it up!

04:51.791 --> 04:52.625
[hens clucking]

04:56.671 --> 04:58.214
Go! Go.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.883
[Auss] Come on. Move!

05:00.967 --> 05:02.927
Make way! Move!

05:09.267 --> 05:11.477
[woman] Come on, let's go. Go.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.938
I'm freezin'! [grunting]

05:15.898 --> 05:16.733
[panting]

05:22.488 --> 05:24.115
[grunts]

05:27.952 --> 05:29.996
[Ruth] Make way. Oh!

05:31.289 --> 05:34.792
-Make way. Oh, my God.
-[Pelton] You're out of luck.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.337
What do you expect?
We've already treated 170 wounded.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.716
Sorry, <i>Snowpiercer</i>
ran out of morphine yesterday.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.511
What? And what if Mr. Wilford
is in distress back there?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.224
[Layton] First Class china,
just hand it off to the next guy.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.309
He's right outside.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.393
He's really still alive?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.396
The last item is a bottle
of Mr. Wilford's favorite scotch.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.865
This is just the beginning, Andre.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.201
He's going to take
everything we just fought for.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.287
Tell me about it later. Out of the way!

06:14.874 --> 06:15.917
[Melanie grunting]

06:19.921 --> 06:22.924
[Bennett] Melanie, that's threshold.
You know the signs.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.051
You'll get confused,
start losing your motor skills.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.135
[Melanie] I'm fine.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.890
She's doing it. She's got us a hand free.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.309
-Mel, you did it.
-[Melanie grunts]

06:33.392 --> 06:34.602
[Bennett] <i>Let's get you aboard.</i>

06:37.271 --> 06:38.481
[Melanie whispers] I'm not done yet.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.234
[breathing heavily]

06:45.196 --> 06:46.364
Mel?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.618
[indistinct voices and static
on comms system]

06:53.704 --> 06:54.747
[grunts]

07:12.807 --> 07:15.268
-Oh, my God.
-What the hell happened to that guy?

07:16.644 --> 07:20.314
Melanie! Melanie, come in.
It's time to come home.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.283
We got what we could. Now let's move.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.200
What's missing?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.743
[Ruth] There's no morphine,
but we have aspirin.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.495
We make our own, as he knows.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.497
Look, it's 20 below zero here.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.332
-Can we get moving?
-It's 22.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.793
I'm sure we can talk about this
while the train is moving.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.300
Mr. Wilford thanks you
for your cooperation.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.427
[Ruth] Alex, wait. Alex!

07:49.510 --> 07:50.928
[passengers clamoring]

07:52.638 --> 07:54.348
-[man grunting]
-[metal clanking]

07:58.477 --> 07:59.812
[engine starts]

08:03.441 --> 08:04.859

08:06.152 --> 08:07.069
[passengers exclaim]

08:20.875 --> 08:21.918
[grunts]

08:23.169 --> 08:24.545
[air hissing]

08:31.761 --> 08:32.887
Yes!

08:32.970 --> 08:34.180
[passengers cheering]

08:35.056 --> 08:36.933
Well, I suppose that's a good sign.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.268
Ruth, he's got his foot on our neck.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.062
You get it?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.773
The majority of us
just fought a war for democracy,

08:43.856 --> 08:46.192
so you need to decide
whose side you're on.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.160
[Bennett] <i>Melanie?</i>

08:57.328 --> 08:59.413
<i>Melanie, are you aboard this train?</i>

09:01.290 --> 09:03.251
<i>Melanie, get on the train.</i>

09:07.672 --> 09:09.674
<i>Melanie, are you aboard? Come in.</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:11.008
[breathing heavily]

09:17.723 --> 09:19.600
Melanie, get on the train!

09:20.851 --> 09:22.270
[whispers] There's something here.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.108
I think it's snowing.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.277
She's losing it, man.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.029
Melanie, listen to me.
It's too cold to snow anymore.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.781
Get aboard the train.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.701
Melanie, stay with me.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.746
Melanie.

09:41.872 --> 09:42.873
<i>Melanie!</i>

09:50.756 --> 09:51.591
[breathing heavily]

10:09.108 --> 10:09.942
[grunts]

10:11.277 --> 10:13.988
<i>-Ben, if you can hear me...</i>
-Yes.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.157
...I'm boarding <i>Big Alice.</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:54.070
[coughing]

10:56.030 --> 10:58.366
[Alexandra] <i>Strip out of the suit</i>
<i>for disinfection.</i>

11:09.752 --> 11:12.713
[groans]

11:30.856 --> 11:32.733
Ow. [winces]

11:33.526 --> 11:34.735
[groans]

11:37.238 --> 11:38.739
[yelps]

11:41.826 --> 11:42.660
[groaning]

11:51.669 --> 11:52.753
Very funny.

12:02.847 --> 12:03.681
[sighs]

12:04.265 --> 12:05.266
Kevin.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.852
Fancy meeting you here.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.688
You're new, though.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.689
[electricity sizzles]

12:11.772 --> 12:12.606
[screams]

12:13.774 --> 12:15.818
That's for leaving us to die.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.912
I know the way.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.462
How many Tailies we got left down here?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.130
[Lights] Only about half, I figure.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.383
Some got berths already,
but most are just camping out up-train.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.177
Some of us don't want to leave.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.180
Look, here's where I'm going with this.
The Tail is not the Tail anymore.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.891
It's a border,
and you have to control a border.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.435
Keep a strong force back here
to hold the real estate.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.562
Seven years
we've been trying to get out of here,

12:51.645 --> 12:53.939
and now the place
is finally worth something.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.399
Let's get organized.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.248
We should build a second barricade here.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.792
Yeah, good idea.
Keep strengthening this area.

13:13.876 --> 13:17.463
If he's prepared to stop the train,
we have to assume he'll attack.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.965
I would advise
against assumptions, Mr. Layton.

13:20.049 --> 13:24.261
If we don't talk to the passengers soon,
I swear the track talk will eat us alive.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.346
Hardcomm's back up.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.680
Thank you, Ruth.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.766
I will address the train
after a council meeting

13:28.849 --> 13:30.559
in the Nightcar, immediately.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.321
This is where we bid you goodbye, Melanie.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.998
[dog growls]

13:57.419 --> 13:58.420
Hey, Jupiter.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.591
-[dog whimpers]
-Hey.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.426
Easy, girl.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.720
[Wilford chuckles]

14:07.429 --> 14:08.430
She remembers you.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.019
I was half hoping she would eat you.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.729
[Melanie exhales sharply]

14:16.939 --> 14:20.025
Wow. Your train has dimmers.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.151
[Wilford] You like her?

14:21.235 --> 14:24.613
Old <i>Alice</i> has done
everything we've asked of her and more.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.992
Not exactly the plan, though, was it?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.164
Come closer, come on.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.501
Let's see what the years have done to you.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.389
[Melanie sighs]

14:56.312 --> 14:58.647
Who've you got up there driving my Engine,

14:59.398 --> 15:02.067
while you're outside
chopping firewood, hmm?

15:02.735 --> 15:03.944
Is it Ben?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.656
Name, rank and serial number.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.036
-That's all you get.
-Sorry. [chuckles] Too eager.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.998
Never expected we'd come
face to face so quickly, did you?

15:16.832 --> 15:18.417
-It's Ben, though, isn't it?
-[scoffs]

15:18.500 --> 15:20.419
You've always had an eye for talent.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.796
[chuckles]

15:22.880 --> 15:24.298
Why don't we talk about you?

15:24.381 --> 15:27.468
How'd you do it? Come on.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.180
How'd you drop in on us
in Chicago like that?

15:31.263 --> 15:33.974
-I know you're dying to tell me.
-[chuckles] Yes!

15:34.725 --> 15:35.559
Finally!

15:35.643 --> 15:37.728
I love a good swashbuckler, don't you?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.230
You've probably figured out some of it.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.107
I got <i>Alice</i> to low idle,

15:42.191 --> 15:45.277
managed to hunker down
in her shed for a couple of months.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.738
By the time
you were on the other side of the world,

15:48.530 --> 15:51.325
out of satellite view, we were outfitted.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.788
I was always lurking, Melanie,

15:56.830 --> 15:58.582
waiting for my moment to pounce.

15:59.875 --> 16:00.793
<i>Voilà!</i>

16:02.711 --> 16:03.712
And, uh...

16:04.713 --> 16:05.714
you took a shortcut?

16:07.257 --> 16:11.512
Yeah. You came over the old
Rocky Mountain test track, didn't you?

16:13.347 --> 16:14.723
I'll tell you everything...

16:15.808 --> 16:17.434
-when you give me the keys.
-Ah.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.479
-I can't do that.
-Oh, you will.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.564
You may have cut my uplink,

16:22.648 --> 16:25.484
but I can still drop anchor
and grind you to a halt.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.326
<i>Snowpiercer</i> won't survive
more than 20 minutes if you disconnect.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.870
It's ironic, isn't it, my protégé?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.624
You run away from me all these years,

16:41.333 --> 16:45.003
and all of a sudden,
you just can't bear to be apart from me.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.008
I want my train back, Melanie.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.179
Actually, you still ran her
until very recently.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.266
What's that supposed to mean?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.476
Means I found it easier to keep you alive.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.021
I convinced people
you were still in the Engine.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.190
But I lost control.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.736
She's not mine to surrender.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.365
Then whose is she?

17:15.576 --> 17:16.744
A Tailie's.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.078
And what is a Tailie?

17:18.162 --> 17:21.290
I won't give you anything,
no matter what you do to me.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.168
And I know you want me to suffer.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.088
You can't hurt me anymore.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.133
Not really.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.094
[door opens]

17:37.097 --> 17:38.640
Hello, Melanie.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.309
[dog barks and growls]

17:40.392 --> 17:41.518
[gasping]

17:46.857 --> 17:48.108
Alex...

17:51.070 --> 17:51.987
You...

17:52.738 --> 17:54.072
You're alive.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.826
[Melanie gasps]

17:59.244 --> 18:03.207
-I'm distinctly underwhelmed.
-Life's big moments are often like that.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.709
Whatever he told you, it isn't true.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.171
You stole a train and then you left me.
What's not true about that?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.006
No, I sent people for you.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.550
For you...

18:14.676 --> 18:16.678
For you and for Grandma and Grandpa.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.514
But they never came back.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.599
I was waiting for you.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.769
But stealing the future from me
was more important, wasn't it?

18:23.852 --> 18:26.897
Alex, please, there's...

18:28.857 --> 18:30.067
There's too much to say.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.319
[Wilford] God, yes, change the subject.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.823
Their society is a shambles up there,
but Ag-Sec is working.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.990
[chuckles]

18:38.617 --> 18:41.703
Oh, good. Poultry, eggs.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.164
First Class Dining
hasn't derailed off a cliff.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.042
[Alexandra] They were out of morphine,
and I didn't see any Jackboots.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.752
[Wilford] Must have been painful.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.005
-You know what a Tailie is?
-No.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.675
But a man named Layton
appears to be in charge,

18:54.758 --> 18:57.052
along with, who I assume is,
Lead Brakeman Roche

18:57.136 --> 18:59.721
-and the blonde from Hospitality.
-Hmm.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.516
Never heard of a Mr. Layton.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.435
Apparently, your mother's
been impersonating me up there.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.229
Do they miss me?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.815
[Alexandra scoffs] Well,
Hospitality is still in uniform.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.525
Ah. [laughs]

19:12.526 --> 19:13.569
Miss Audrey.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.197
Still with us.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.032
Hello.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.162
-Is everyone getting along?
-No. Take Melanie to the brig.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.746
[Kevin] Yes, ma'am.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.417
Look at me, honey.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.086
[Kevin] Calmly now. Don't make it worse.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.212
[door opens]

19:36.884 --> 19:39.553
-[passengers clamoring]
-[Bennett] Please.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.973
[Bennett] Yes,
we have full engineering control,

19:43.765 --> 19:46.476
but <i>Big Alice</i> is like
an anchor controlling our speed.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.771
[Layton] The supply train
that's built for a crew of what, 60?

19:49.855 --> 19:53.734
[Bennett] Give or take. But there's no way
for us to know how she's been retrofitted.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.446
-What's her maximum crew size? Guess.
-Guess? 200.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.531
-[passengers gasp]
-[Bennett] But probably less.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.867
Our engineer is their prisoner.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.537
[Ruth] The passengers are tired of war.
Am I wrong?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.955
[passengers clamoring]

20:07.039 --> 20:10.250
She's clearly not wrong.
Everyone's exhausted. We need to recover.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.629
They haven't invaded, have they?
So let's just have a cooling-off period.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.380
[Rajiv] Please, yes, open talks with him.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.424
[Ruth] Melanie's probably
back there right now,

20:17.507 --> 20:19.676
working things out
with Mr. Wilford and her daughter.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.553
[passengers clamoring]

20:22.471 --> 20:26.433
Mr. Wilford doesn't just
want control of his train.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.812
He wants control of all of you,
body and soul.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.940
-[clamoring]
-[man 1] That's right! We don't trust him.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.191
[man 2] We want to talk to him.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.026
[Layton] Hey, quiet down.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.903
-[clamoring continues]
-[Layton] Quiet!

20:37.986 --> 20:41.240
A 40-car parasite
does not call the shots around here,

20:41.323 --> 20:43.742
<i>-Snowpiercer</i> does.
-[all cheering]

20:48.080 --> 20:51.041
All right, we hold fast.
Call it a cooling-off if you want to,

20:51.124 --> 20:54.169
but we do not start talks
until Wilford turns over Melanie.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.337
[Roche] You heard the man.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.881
Our first priority, our responsibility,

20:57.965 --> 21:02.052
is to keep <i>Snowpiercer</i>
calm, fed and united.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.679
The same as it ever was.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.436
Let's get a force together.
Quickly, quietly. Keep Ruth out of it.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.063
No, we can't attack them.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.232
We basically have no idea
what's behind that door.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.777
-What about Melanie?
-Melanie is the reason we have to do this.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.114
Okay, look, I know everyone's tired,
but Wilford's got a plan.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.283
We need to hit him before he hits us.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.119
[Z-Wreck] Look who it is.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.871
[speaking Mandarin]

21:30.789 --> 21:31.832
Whoa, where are you going?

21:31.915 --> 21:33.542
-[Zarah] Don't touch me.
-[Z-Wreck] Or what?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.502
[Strong Boy speaking Mandarin]

21:36.253 --> 21:39.381
Just a warning, Mr. Layton.
Your laundry's about to flap.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.633
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shit.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.427
-That's enough.
-[Z-Wreck] You're not going anywhere.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.637
[Layton] Back up! Z-Wreck, Strong Boy,
what's wrong with you?

21:45.721 --> 21:48.640
She sold out Josie.
She don't gotta pay for that?

21:48.724 --> 21:50.434
-Melanie was threatening her.
-[Z-Wreck] She cracked.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.228
-Now, Josie's dead.
-I'm pregnant, all right?

21:54.688 --> 21:55.689
Is that true?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.608
Zarah?

21:59.776 --> 22:01.570
Yes, it is.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.823
[Ruth] A pregnancy on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

22:05.866 --> 22:06.908
It's hope.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.619
Melanie was threatening our child.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.372
-Your child?
-[speaking Mandarin]

22:13.206 --> 22:15.625
My goodness. This changes everything.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.461
All right, you two, go on. Shove off!

22:17.544 --> 22:18.962
-Leave the woman alone.
-What?

22:19.046 --> 22:21.256
Back to whatever hole
you were sleeping in.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.341
[Z-Wreck] This ain't right.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.135
Let me tell you something, Layton.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.345
All this personal shit,

22:26.428 --> 22:29.181
it ain't making your democracy
any easier to believe in.

22:29.890 --> 22:30.974
[Z-Wreck scoffs]

22:31.058 --> 22:32.476
[Ruth] So you can't stay in the Chains.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.728
Carrying your child,
she might be a target.

22:35.437 --> 22:39.274
I will find somewhere for you,
up-train, away from all the ruckus.

22:40.108 --> 22:43.111
Okay? Now, we really
must address the passengers.

22:49.785 --> 22:53.538
I'm on the side
of <i>Snowpiercer,</i> Mr. Layton.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.291
I work for the passengers, just like you.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.627
[Layton] Good.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.004
Well, speak your truth.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.340
That's how they seem to trust you.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.930
[PA system chimes]

23:10.806 --> 23:12.224
Citizens of <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

23:14.017 --> 23:18.063
<i>It took us seven long years</i>
<i>to cast off Wilford's class system.</i>

23:18.897 --> 23:21.983
<i>And now, the man is back</i>
<i>and latched onto the Tail.</i>

23:22.067 --> 23:24.277
<i>We know he's willing to stop us cold,</i>

23:24.361 --> 23:27.531
<i>but Brakemen and the rebel army</i>
<i>have control of the new border.</i>

23:28.740 --> 23:33.411
Ruth Wardell and Hospitality
will lead diplomatic initiatives.

23:33.495 --> 23:37.791
Snowpiercer <i>will use all means necessary</i>
<i>to defend the liberties we've won.</i>

23:42.796 --> 23:43.797
But...

23:45.590 --> 23:47.759
with everything we have sacrificed,

23:49.136 --> 23:51.388
<i>it is my great regret...</i>

23:52.639 --> 23:54.224
<i>and my reluctant duty...</i>

23:55.433 --> 23:57.936
to put our democratic experiment on hold,

23:59.479 --> 24:02.440
and to extend martial law
until further notice.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.985
-[sighs]
-[PA system chimes]

24:05.068 --> 24:09.531
That, my half-ass warrior friends,
means trouble comes.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.158
That will not be popular.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.786
[Bennett] What choice does he have?

24:14.870 --> 24:18.039
Tunnelmen fought for a vote.
We should be writing a constitution.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.207
Jakes.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.543
I wish we were preparing
for elections, too.

24:21.626 --> 24:26.006
But there's a few more miles to go,
and we're calling on your guild again.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.883
Okay?

24:43.023 --> 24:43.982
[door opens]

24:51.990 --> 24:52.991
[sighs]

24:55.327 --> 24:56.870
What's it like outside?

24:57.370 --> 25:00.874
Don't get immediately weird, okay?
I just have some questions.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.167
Yeah, okay.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.961
Um...

25:06.630 --> 25:08.590
What's it like outside? Um...

25:09.591 --> 25:10.634
It's chilly.

25:12.928 --> 25:13.970
It's horrifying.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.432
And it's, uh...

25:18.683 --> 25:20.936
It's really sad to think about

25:21.019 --> 25:23.897
everything that lived
only a few years ago.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.023
Nematodes will survive.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.609
Yeah. [chuckles]

25:28.401 --> 25:30.278
Yeah, nematodes will.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.906
Are you frostbit?

25:33.949 --> 25:37.118
A little bit. It's fine.
It just broke the seal in my suit.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.871
I remember less and less of it.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.164
The old world.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.792
That's a shame.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.379
I'm sorry
you couldn't spend more time in it.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.006
The train is our world now.
We can control this.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.176
What?

25:55.303 --> 25:57.264
What happened with Grandma and Grandpa?

25:58.348 --> 26:00.892
They wouldn't leave
with the men that you sent.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.020
They wanted to die at home.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.190
They said I should go,
but I didn't want to leave them.

26:07.816 --> 26:08.858
[chuckles]

26:14.739 --> 26:15.824
[voice breaks] You know...

26:17.033 --> 26:20.078
[sighs] I sent you away
to live with them for a reason.

26:20.161 --> 26:23.790
Why, because you had a train to steal,
so you didn't need a daughter anymore?

26:24.541 --> 26:25.834
To keep you from him.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.295
He's the one
who saved me after you left me.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.671
That's not why he saved you.

26:31.506 --> 26:35.051
-What is this? It was in your suit.
-It's a snow sample.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.053
Well, why'd you take a snow sample?

26:37.137 --> 26:41.016
[sighs] Because I haven't been
off <i>Snowpiercer</i> in seven years.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.644
You are lying to me again.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.734
[inhales deeply]

27:02.329 --> 27:04.539
[Layton] Ruth,
she can't be up here in First.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.125
-[Zarah] Why not?
-Come on, Zarah. How's it look?

27:08.209 --> 27:10.754
I don't care how it looks.
I care about the baby.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.469
[Ruth] You are going to need
a place, Mr. Layton.

27:17.552 --> 27:20.597
A base of operations
for day-to-day administration.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.516
You can use this whole floor.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.769
There are separate
accommodations upstairs.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.521
Pregnancy comes with privilege
on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

27:28.605 --> 27:30.523
[Zarah] We don't know
how to thank you, Ruth.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.108
I don't know how you pulled this off.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.112
Well, everyone's bending rules
these days, aren't they, Mr. Layton?

27:36.196 --> 27:39.949
What happened to the, uh... chic owners?

27:40.617 --> 27:43.453
It was the Schwartz's car.
They were in their eighties.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.414
They took cyanide the morning
the Tailie army took the train.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.459
So it would be nice
to let some joy back in, wouldn't it? Mmm?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.878
With a little one running around.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.925
Two security chips, your door keys.

27:57.550 --> 27:58.760
You're welcome.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.861
-[door opens]
-[Melanie gasps]

28:18.738 --> 28:19.906
[door closes]

28:20.949 --> 28:23.493
Turn around. Hands behind your back.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.598
[Melanie breathing shakily]

28:49.269 --> 28:50.770
[Mr. Headwood] Oh.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.231

to manually undo the grappling arms.

44:28.624 --> 44:30.793
Holy shit. [chuckles]
We're stuck together.

44:30.876 --> 44:33.170
Yeah, we are, permanently.

44:35.172 --> 44:38.008
So you better give Alex the order
to get <i>Snowpiercer</i> moving again

44:38.092 --> 44:39.510
or we'll all die in a few minutes.

44:39.593 --> 44:40.511
Never.

44:40.594 --> 44:42.930
[Melanie] It's kind of
the only solution, really.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.848
We'll have to find a way to work together.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.017
-She got you, Dubs.
-Shut up!

44:47.101 --> 44:48.936
Really don't have a choice.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.481
Wait...

44:54.316 --> 44:55.317
for the order.

45:15.129 --> 45:16.463
[all exclaiming]

45:24.304 --> 45:27.057
Oh, thank God. We're spared.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.644
He spared us.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.984
It's gonna be a long, cold war.
