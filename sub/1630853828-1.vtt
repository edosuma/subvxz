Why don't you use-- why can't
you fight him yourself?

Because I cannot
physically harm a person,

31:00.066 --> 31:02.066

31:04.499 --> 31:06.037
How about this?

31:06.072 --> 31:10.470

31:13.178 --> 31:14.705

sometimes levitate small objects

31:19.448 --> 31:21.547

using our muscles,

generate a lot of force from it.

32:14.041 --> 32:15.304
Forget it.

32:19.970 --> 32:21.772
