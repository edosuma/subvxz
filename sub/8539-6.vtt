[indistinct chattering on radio]

00:34.556 --> 00:36.862
That damn GPS is gonna put it
in California. I know it.

00:36.949 --> 00:40.170
Ah, think positive.
It's Nevada. Definitely Nevada.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.999
You're dreaming. We'll catch it.
Stone-cold mystery.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.697
Hey, forensics are already
running the prints.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.177
Maybe we'll get a quick match.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.136
Puff.
We'd never get that lucky.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.834
No, we're gonna be talking
to the hand for a long while.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.531
Why so glum?
Case is a case.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.098
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.057
Windy as all hell.
I haven't eaten anything.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.884
Aw, dismemberments
are a bitch.

00:58.971 --> 00:59.972
You spend months
assembling the victim

01:00.060 --> 01:01.365
there's always
a piece missing.

01:01.452 --> 01:04.064
There's already plenty
to work with, right here.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.241
It's a right hand
with the number 43 on it.

01:07.328 --> 01:10.026
It's a male hand,
or a not very femme female.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.029
What else do we got to work
with right here?

01:13.116 --> 01:14.465
Without forensic analysis.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.816
Let's see.
Probably a white man, mid '50s.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.210
He wrote on his right hand,
so he's a lefty.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.299
Well, maybe the killer wrote it,
some kind of message.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.823
Too faded, and a killer
would write it bigger.

01:31.178 --> 01:34.094
[instrumental music]

01:35.051 --> 01:36.531
Consultant.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.273
Smells of almond-oil moisturizer

01:39.360 --> 01:42.711
musky cologne and tobacco

01:42.798 --> 01:45.017
'Palms are supple.'

01:45.105 --> 01:47.672
Nails are professionally
maintained.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.979
So a rich man.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.851
There's a faint tan line
on the little finger

01:52.938 --> 01:55.158
from a missing pinkie ring
which suggests

01:55.245 --> 01:58.988
an extrovert in a job
where extroverts thrive.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.555
So?

02:00.642 --> 02:03.601
He's upper management
in the hotel or gaming business.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.995
Total guess.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.257
What do you wanna bet
I'm right?

02:10.913 --> 02:12.175
Thirty-five cents.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.439
- Thirty five cents?
- Yeah.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.399
I find that hard to believe
considering that crayon bank

02:18.486 --> 02:20.227
you've probably got hidden
behind your bedroom door

02:20.314 --> 02:21.706
that you've been filling
with all the spare change

02:21.793 --> 02:23.926
you could accumulate
since you were what, 15?

02:27.930 --> 02:29.932
- Thirty five cents.
- I'll take it. You gotta bet.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.368
Alright.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.370
I don't think it's right
to bet on such things.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.937
That's a human being
that died.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.895
No, it's okay.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.506
We're in Nevada.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.334
Here in California, yeah,
that'd be wrong.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.772
But here...in Nevada..

02:43.859 --> 02:45.121
..it's okay to gamble
on body parts.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.864
The hand's three feet into
the state of California

02:48.951 --> 02:50.082
so he's our baby.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.433
- Hooray.
- Yeah. "Hooray."

02:52.520 --> 02:54.174
Get our friend
bagged and tagged.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.306
- Let's get outta here.
- Do we have an I.D. at least?

02:56.393 --> 02:58.874
The prints says that
it's James Quincy Meier.

02:58.961 --> 03:02.182
He runs the Calida Resort
and Casino. Come on.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.274
[clearing throat]

03:09.624 --> 03:10.538
Thank you.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.327
[instrumental music]

03:23.290 --> 03:24.943
[birds chirping]

03:25.030 --> 03:29.121
Are you certain that he isn't
still out there, alive?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.123
[Lisbon]
'Yes, forensics
evidence supports'

03:31.211 --> 03:33.125
the hand being
severed postmortem.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.477
- And the rest of his body?
- We're looking.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.655
[Ann]
'It doesn't seem real.'

03:42.265 --> 03:43.701
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

03:44.789 --> 03:47.314
Yesterday.
Tuesday morning.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.229
Jim would often stay
overnight at the resort

03:49.316 --> 03:52.057
if he needed to be there
late to resolve an issue.

03:52.144 --> 03:55.278
But he would call
and let me know that he was..

03:55.365 --> 03:56.758
He was gonna stay
so I wouldn't worry.

03:56.845 --> 03:57.976
We understand
that Mr. Meier

03:58.063 --> 03:59.021
didn't have
a cell phone.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.414
Didn't believe in them.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.198
[Van]
'So was it him that called'

04:02.285 --> 04:04.635
'this house from
a casino phone at'

04:04.722 --> 04:06.028
um, 8:05 Tuesday night?

04:06.115 --> 04:08.770
Yes.
He was just checking in.

04:08.857 --> 04:12.252
Casinos run 24 hours a day,
so Jim did the same.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.731
I think I saw Jim
more than they did.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.298
You work at the casino
as well?

04:15.385 --> 04:18.083
Dan is the VIP
Guest Services executive.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.563
I'm a glorified house player.

04:19.650 --> 04:20.912
It's more than
just that, Daniel.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.087
What's a house player?

04:22.174 --> 04:24.089
Jim pays me to
herd the whales.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.961
The big-money gamblers.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.485
I play with casino money,
to break the ice

04:28.572 --> 04:30.357
get the heavy action going.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.576
It's a good steady gig.
Keeps me out of trouble.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.839
[Lisbon]
'When was the last time
you saw Jim?'

04:34.926 --> 04:36.885
[Daniel]
'Same as Ann.'

04:41.063 --> 04:43.979
[instrumental music]

05:01.779 --> 05:03.259
Your dad knew Sinatra?

05:05.043 --> 05:06.262
'Sure.'

05:06.349 --> 05:08.960
Uh, Sinatra kissed me
right here

05:09.047 --> 05:11.398
on my first birthday party.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.313
That's what dad
always said, anyhow.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.317
- But you didn't believe him.
- Figured there'd be a photo.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.755
He wasn't around much when you
were growing up, was he?

05:20.842 --> 05:23.235
What makes you say that?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.672
Figured there'd be a photo.

05:24.759 --> 05:25.890
[chuckles]

05:28.980 --> 05:31.592
He wasn't around a lot.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.899
But he loved me.
I know he did. He just..

05:36.423 --> 05:38.555
He didn't have
a whole lot of time.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.868
The number 43 was written
on Mr. Meier's hand.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.349
Any idea what the significance
of that might be?

05:50.393 --> 05:52.395
- No idea.
- Damn!

05:54.876 --> 05:57.008
Stupid son of a bitch went
for the 2-point conversion.

05:57.095 --> 06:00.142
Excuse me.
Get me a scotch, would you, hon?

06:02.710 --> 06:05.060
Can you think of anybody who
might want to harm your husband?

06:07.149 --> 06:09.107
Jim was a well-liked man..

06:09.194 --> 06:10.892
...but he stuck to
his principles

06:10.979 --> 06:12.763
and that's a dangerous thing
to do in his business.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.852
Is there a specific instance
you're thinking of?

06:14.939 --> 06:17.072
No.
No, it's just a feeling.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.595
Mom, it's a hotel casino

06:18.682 --> 06:20.597
and not a crack house.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.469
The mafia's not running
anything anymore.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.688
So you say.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.037
Robbery might have
been a motive.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.822
'Did he carry a lot
of cash on him?'

06:27.909 --> 06:28.997
'Did he wear
expensive jewelry?'

06:29.084 --> 06:30.607
No.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.522
'He didn't need cash.'

06:32.609 --> 06:34.350
Jim's word was money.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.962
And he wore a ring
on his pinkie finger..

06:38.049 --> 06:41.226
...and a lucky
$100,000 chip

06:41.313 --> 06:43.011
on a string
round his neck.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.839
- That's all.
- That's a lot of money.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.406
Was the chip legal tender?

06:46.493 --> 06:50.061
In the casino, yes.
But only in the casino.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.890
Can you give us an exact
description of the chip?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.588
We want to alert
the casino cashiers.

06:54.675 --> 06:58.418
Yes, we have a photo of it
for the insurance company.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.898
I was actually just going
through all of the papers.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.773
Here it is.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.209
Thank you.

07:07.296 --> 07:10.212
[instrumental music]

07:16.044 --> 07:19.047
- Any more body parts show up?
- 'Nothing so far.'

07:19.134 --> 07:21.353
[Rigsby]
'Possibly the hand was
the only piece cut off.'

07:21.441 --> 07:24.095
Does that match up to any
similar cases in the past?

07:24.182 --> 07:26.054
[Rigsby]
'Uh, this was where
it gets interesting.'

07:26.141 --> 07:27.577
There several cases like this

07:27.664 --> 07:29.579
where a hand was purposely
left to be found.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.276
They're all Reno
and Las Vegas based

07:31.363 --> 07:32.887
involved organized crime.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.455
None are more recent
than 10 years ago.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.544
They do it to people who get
their hands caught in the till.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.547
Mafia.
Great. Thanks.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.292
Agent Lisbon?

07:47.379 --> 07:48.990
Matt Etienne.
I'm head of security.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.732
This is Agent Van Pelt
and Mr. Jane from our team.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.516
Hi.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.083
Well, as you can imagine,
we're all still pretty

07:55.170 --> 07:56.345
shell-shocked around here.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.695
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:58.782 --> 08:02.177
Well, if you'll
all follow me.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.527
The casino's on the Nevada
side of the resort

08:04.614 --> 08:06.486
and offers full-service gaming.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.966
We recently spent 10 million
upgrading the facilities

08:09.053 --> 08:10.446
to improve
the customer's experience.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.056
They use the same techniques

08:12.143 --> 08:13.710
in state-of-the-art
animal husbandry

08:13.797 --> 08:15.277
to make the cows
and sheep feel comfortable.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.454
- Really?
- Dim lights, soft music.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.544
'A maze of passages that
lead you back to the pens'

08:21.631 --> 08:22.850
or in this case, the slots.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.895
Ooh, don't hold back.
Speak your mind.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.506
There's no clocks
or windows anywhere

08:26.593 --> 08:28.464
so there's no
passage of time.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.640
Low-priced alcohol
is poured down you

08:30.727 --> 08:32.424
by attractive young women.

08:32.512 --> 08:36.037
Oxygen is pumped into the place
to make you stay awake..

08:36.124 --> 08:38.822
...and the constant
symphony of bells and sirens

08:38.909 --> 08:41.042
that make it seem like
someone's winning all the time.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.435
Ah, but someone
is always winning.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.090
You see, our machines and our
games are carefully designed

08:46.177 --> 08:48.963
...to let every gambler
have a taste of victory.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.008
'Ah, just enough sugar to keep
them pumping their money'

08:51.095 --> 08:53.054
into the machines
and onto the table.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.274
- So, what's your point?
- Oh, no point. I love it.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.453
Ladies, give, give me luck.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.153
- Who's that?
- 'Cal Trask.'

09:05.240 --> 09:07.416
A very serious gambler
and an honored guest.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.071
- A whale?
- Exactly, a whale.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.726
You guys are going to be going

09:12.813 --> 09:14.510
over a bunch of boring files
now, I expect.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.121
So, uh, I think
I'll work here

09:17.208 --> 09:20.603
play a little,
get the lay of the land.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.735
Give me a 100 bucks,
would you?

09:21.822 --> 09:23.301
I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.694
Sure you do.
Come on.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.261
I'll give it back
to you double.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.047
Look, here's a 100.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.571
But you'll give me back
double, right?

09:33.355 --> 09:34.486
Triple.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.013
Oh, yeah, baby.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.408
[instrumental music]

09:48.936 --> 09:51.199
Hi, I'm Patrick.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.330
Hi, Patrick.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.860
I accessed Meier's calendar.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.471
The day he disappeared
he listed an 8:30 P.M. meeting

10:02.558 --> 10:04.995
with the notation "43,"
last meeting of the day.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.780
There we go with
the number 43 again.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.520
See if you can cross-reference
with anything else.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.348
- Matt.
- Yes?

10:10.435 --> 10:11.741
From what we understand

10:11.828 --> 10:13.177
a hand being
discovered like this

10:13.264 --> 10:15.005
is an old-school
mafia signature.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.616
Yes, I've heard
the same thing.

10:16.703 --> 10:17.660
It means an
individual got caught

10:17.747 --> 10:19.270
with his hand in the till.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.709
You don't seriously believe
that's what happened to Jim?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.536
Don Corleone had him whacked?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.103
Who owns this casino?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.801
Our owners are a million

10:27.888 --> 10:29.237
or so good American
men and women

10:29.324 --> 10:31.674
who are shareholders
in our parent company.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.720
Wise guys lost control
of gambling in Nevada

10:33.807 --> 10:35.939
a long time ago.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.071
Hit me.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.031
Seventeen.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.862
Hit me.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.258
Twenty one.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.434
Well done, Patrick.

10:52.521 --> 10:55.655
Thank you. Could we change this
up for $1,000 chips, please?

11:09.059 --> 11:11.018
Hi, my name's Patrick.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.107
Hi, Patrick.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.198
[instrumental music]

11:25.510 --> 11:29.297
'Mr. Etienne, we have
a possible Code 9 at Table 43.'

11:29.384 --> 11:31.560
- What's a Code 9?
- Cheating.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.692
I'll be right there.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.780
Table 43?

11:36.783 --> 11:39.437
- Blackjack.
- Oh, yeah.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.049
Keep squeezing them, baby.
Make them squeal.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.616
- Ha-ha.
- Come on, ladies.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.488
Whoo.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.359
Mr. Jane, may I have
a word with you?

11:48.446 --> 11:50.144
- Just a minute.
- Jane.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.885
- I'm on a streak.
- Yes, you are.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.625
And we're really wondering
what your secret is.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.410
There's no secret.
I'm memorizing the cards.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.195
Yes, well, Mr. Jane,
we don't like people doing that.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.371
Is having a good
memory illegal?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.808
No, it's not.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.201
We can only congratulate
you on your good luck

12:04.288 --> 12:07.639
and bar you from the
establishment in the future.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.730
Okay. Well, that was fun
while it lasted.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.647
By the way,
I hate to be a telltale

12:15.735 --> 12:17.127
but Alexandra
is robbing you blind.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.216
- Excuse me?
- She's cheating.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.786
'She's flashing her hidden
card to the big guy'

12:23.873 --> 12:25.614
'on the end of the table
and when that didn't work'

12:25.701 --> 12:27.094
'she's dealing the rest
of the table cards'

12:27.181 --> 12:28.399
'from just underneath
the top of the deck'

12:28.486 --> 12:30.575
'and holding back
the top cards for him.'

12:36.277 --> 12:37.626
I think this is mine.

12:37.713 --> 12:40.150
Here, do you wanna help me?
Thank you.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.415
Good luck. Good luck.
Good luck.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.606
Ah, the hustler returns.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.608
Lisbon says you won
a whole bunch of money.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.001
Oh, I didn't do too badly.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.744
- How much you win?
- About 250,000.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.095
You won $250,000?

13:12.182 --> 13:14.532
Yeah. Are they talking
to the dealer lady?

13:14.619 --> 13:16.099
Yes.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.627
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.630
Very impressive scheme you set
up with your cousin Mose.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.458
Sixty percent on anything
under five grand

13:27.545 --> 13:29.156
fifty-fifty
on anything above.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.461
You must be living
pretty large.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.028
If by "Large"
you mean saving up

13:32.115 --> 13:34.814
to buy my mom a new liver
before she dies, then sure.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.033
I'm living real large.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.253
That big twerp
told you all of that?

13:39.340 --> 13:41.472
Started singing like Menudo
the minute he sat down.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.300
Oh, good, help is
so hard to find.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.302
Meier was on to you.
That's what the meeting was for.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.565
He probably fired you
on the spot, didn't he?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.741
It's ballsy to come back to work
after something like that.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.613
Only someone who knew
he'd been killed would do that.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.397
I didn't kill him.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.703
Then how did you know
before everyone else here

13:54.790 --> 13:56.139
that he was dead, Alexandra?

13:56.226 --> 13:58.838
I didn't.
I came back to beg for my job.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.189
'When I heard what happened'

14:02.276 --> 14:03.712
'I realized that no one
knew about our meeting'

14:03.799 --> 14:05.496
so I went back to work.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.150
I need this job.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.717
Losing your job,
going to jail

14:08.804 --> 14:10.414
who's gonna look
after your mom?

14:10.501 --> 14:13.026
Now that's a prospect
that would make anyone upset.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.332
If you had a moment of insanity,
I can understand that.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.379
- Anyone can understand that.
- I didn't kill him.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.164
I wonder why Meier didn't
talk to Etienne about her.

14:21.251 --> 14:25.429
As head of security, she's
ultimately his responsibility.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.823
Maybe he figured Etienne
was in on it with her?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.694
[Cho]
'Where did you go after
your talk with Meier?'

14:29.781 --> 14:34.134
I spent the rest of the night
at the hospital with my mother.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.571
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
Quick question.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.312
When Meier asked you
if Matt Etienne

14:38.399 --> 14:41.097
was involved in your scam
what did you tell him?

14:41.184 --> 14:43.665
I told him Mr. Etienne
had nothing to do with it.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.929
- But he does, doesn't he?
- No.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.540
Thanks.
You can go.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.545
- She can?
- She can?

14:58.245 --> 15:02.249
- She can go, can she?
- I'm sorry.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.381
The Nevada gaming commission's
gonna wanna charge her

15:04.468 --> 15:06.862
with gaming violations.
Why should we let her go?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.299
Why do we get so hung up on
every little law someone breaks?

15:09.386 --> 15:11.171
Because we're
officers of the law?

15:11.258 --> 15:14.957
Also because
Matt Etienne is lying.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.699
Now you can call him
and tell him that Alexandra Yee

15:17.786 --> 15:20.397
cooperated with us,
and based on what she had to say

15:20.484 --> 15:22.008
we'd like to speak to him
first thing in the morning.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.619
Okay, but if he is in
cahoots with Alexandra

15:24.706 --> 15:26.447
he's just gonna call her
and ask her what she said.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.666
And she will swear blind
she said nothing.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.365
Which will make our friend
Matt even more suspicious.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.845
Why did we let her go
if she gave us nothing?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.325
She must have
told us the truth.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.937
- Which is?
- Eh, details, details.

15:39.721 --> 15:40.896
[clearing throat]

15:42.767 --> 15:44.465
What is it?

15:44.552 --> 15:45.988
Open it.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.816
It's not a fake
turd or anything.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.079
Van Pelt.
Catch.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.172
What is this?

15:56.259 --> 15:58.218
Carbon placed under
extreme pressure.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.654
Wow.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.745
- Wow.
- Hee, hee.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.139
- We can't keep this stuff.
- We can't?

16:06.226 --> 16:09.881
- No, it's against regulations.
- No, it's not. Why would it be?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.189
I won the money fair and square,
and I spent it fair and square.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.104
Where do the regulations
come into it?

16:17.019 --> 16:20.501
- So where's our stuff?
- Your stuff?

16:20.588 --> 16:21.806
Well, you didn't just
get stuff for the ladies.

16:21.893 --> 16:22.851
That'd be creepy.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.040
Who's your daddy?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.217
Huh?

16:41.304 --> 16:42.566
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.831
Now it must be worth
a lot of money

16:46.918 --> 16:48.703
because this is the ugliest
watch I've ever seen.

16:48.790 --> 16:52.620
It's horrible. I asked for the
most expensive watches they had.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.709
Whoa.
Thanks, man.

16:57.886 --> 17:01.368
Alright, I got us a table booked
at the best restaurant in town.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.717
Apparently, they tell
you the name of the cow

17:02.804 --> 17:04.197
your steak came from.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.373
- That's horrible.
- 'Forget the steaks.'

17:06.460 --> 17:07.591
[Lisbon]
'We're on a case.'

17:07.678 --> 17:08.679
We can't be seen relaxing

17:08.766 --> 17:09.811
in fancy restaurants.

17:09.898 --> 17:13.032
Good point. Uh, okay.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.469
Little place on the way back
to Calida. Let's go.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.867
So you really won all this
by memorizing cards?

17:22.954 --> 17:24.608
You didn't have cards up
your sleeve or anything?

17:24.695 --> 17:27.916
No, that would be cheating.
Just memory.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.614
- How? That's impossible.
- Not at all.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.181
Anyone can do it.

17:32.268 --> 17:35.315
I'm gonna raise you three.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.403
How?

17:38.231 --> 17:41.147
In my mind, I've made
every card in the deck

17:41.234 --> 17:42.670
into a vivid character.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.673
Jack of hearts, a ballet dancer
with devil's horns.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.896
Two of diamonds.
Duck smoking a cigar. Like that.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.855
- Why a duck?
- Doesn't matter.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.075
Every card is a living thing,
every position in the deck

17:56.162 --> 17:57.772
is a location
in my memory palace.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.472
Okay.
What's a memory palace?

18:02.559 --> 18:04.518
It's a place that is
so clear in your mind

18:04.605 --> 18:06.694
that you can walk
all around it in your head.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.435
Everybody's palace
is different.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.742
Has to be big
and detailed and vivid.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.657
My palace is a
Midwest carnival circuit

18:13.744 --> 18:15.050
I used to travel
with my father.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.139
Your people are carny folk?

18:17.226 --> 18:18.880
You're finally starting
to make sense to me.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.578
Not exactly.
It's a long story.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.493
My point..

18:23.580 --> 18:26.148
...if the 10th card in the deck
is a jack of hearts

18:26.235 --> 18:27.584
I see a devil-horned dancer

18:27.671 --> 18:30.065
at the Joplin,
Missouri, fairgrounds.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.547
- I see you.
- Excuse me.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.767
I can't see how that works.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.073
Here, shuffle these.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.209
Rigsby's holding two pair,
sixes and nines.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.820
Cho, my old friend,
Cho here..

18:45.907 --> 18:48.866
...is hoping for his fifth
spade to make up his flush.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.304
Deal the river card..

18:51.391 --> 18:52.609
...and watch him get it.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.832
Too hot for me.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.268
- Another hand?
- No.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.617
Kind of takes
the fun out of it

19:00.704 --> 19:01.966
when you're playing
with a swami.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.707
Alright, guys.

19:03.794 --> 19:04.969
It's been fun playing dress-up

19:05.056 --> 19:06.275
but playtime's over.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.973
- Sorry, boss, what do you mean?
- This.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.237
It's kind of a waste,
don't you think?

19:11.324 --> 19:14.631
Well, I would have bought
world peace if I could.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.764
'They didn't have it
at the casino gift store.'

19:16.851 --> 19:18.853
Very limited range
of items for sale.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.855
You know what I mean.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.292
I know those emeralds
look lovely with your eyes.

19:23.379 --> 19:27.253
Thank you. It's beautiful,
but I can't keep it.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.385
I understand.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.387
Yeah, you're right.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.783
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.785
Goodnight.

19:39.613 --> 19:40.788
- I'm not giving mine back.
- No way.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.703
That's my boys.
Live it up.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.103
[instrumental music]

20:10.470 --> 20:13.473
[music continues]

20:30.403 --> 20:33.275
[music continues]

20:50.423 --> 20:53.295
[music continues]

21:03.871 --> 21:06.265
[cell phone ringing]

21:07.962 --> 21:10.138
- Hey, Lisbon.
- 'Where are you?'

21:10.225 --> 21:12.967
Oh, just taking a walk.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.143
- 'Ann wants to come clean.'
- I knew it.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.188
She had that air about her.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.452
[Lisbon]
'If you knew it,
why didn't you tell us?'

21:19.539 --> 21:21.497
It's an exaggeration.
I had a strong hunch.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.891
If I told you about every hunch,
you'd get very irritated.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.374
[Ann]
'Matt Etienne
tells me that, uh..'

21:28.461 --> 21:29.810
...one of his employees

21:29.897 --> 21:32.900
may have shared rumors
about him and me.

21:32.987 --> 21:35.772
I wanted to be the first
to clarify the matter for you

21:35.859 --> 21:39.080
and I wanted Jessica and
Daniel to be here so that..

21:39.167 --> 21:41.125
...you understand there
was no subterfuge here.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.344
Okay.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.915
Yes, I was having an affair
with Matt Etienne.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.918
But I didn't murder Jim.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.877
- You knew about the affair?
- Yeah.

21:55.488 --> 21:58.969
I knew about it,
but I didn't like it.

21:59.056 --> 22:03.060
But I understood, because dad
was never there for mom or me.

22:03.147 --> 22:06.237
So, no subterfuge,
except for Jim.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.501
I'm not proud of it.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.286
Matt was there for mom
when dad wasn't.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.375
How long had the affair
been going on?

22:13.462 --> 22:15.072
Two years.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.337
Do you think that Matt did
to clear the field with you?

22:18.424 --> 22:20.643
No. No!

22:20.730 --> 22:22.428
Maybe he had the idea that
that's what you really wanted.

22:22.515 --> 22:25.039
No, you have no right
to say such things.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.257
'Cause, my mother
is not some sort of--

22:26.345 --> 22:27.520
Hey, hush.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.176
I betrayed my husband.
I lied to him.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.482
But I loved him

22:33.569 --> 22:35.876
'and I did not
wish him dead.'

22:35.963 --> 22:39.096
Ask Matt and he'll tell
you the same thing.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.229
- We will. Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.979
Listen, I don't want
Agent Lisbon to hear about this.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.201
She doesn't really approve
of my gambling.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.465
- No?
- No.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.380
But I was hoping that
maybe you could set me up

23:01.467 --> 23:04.687
in a good high-stakes
game of poker.

23:04.774 --> 23:08.604
Someone like Cal Trask,
you know, a whale.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.737
I heard about your hot hands
on the casino floor.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.129
Yeah, I'm feeling lucky.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.961
- I can set you up. Sure.
- Appreciate it. Alright.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.227
Mum's the word.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.892
[siren wailing]

23:45.598 --> 23:48.209
I'm guessing that you're not
just in the neighborhood.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.994
Mr. Etienne, I have a warrant
to search your property.

23:51.952 --> 23:54.650
That's a sweet boat.

23:54.737 --> 23:57.305
You let that dealer,
Alexandra Yee run her scam

23:57.392 --> 24:00.874
because she knew about you
and Mrs. Meier, isn't that so?

24:00.961 --> 24:03.790
And she threatened to tell
Mr. Meier if you fired her.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.575
That's about the size
of it, yeah.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.142
Why didn't you tell us
you were involved

24:08.229 --> 24:09.578
with Mrs. Meier
from the start?

24:09.665 --> 24:11.232
We were bound
to find out.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.321
Because it's not pertinent.

24:13.408 --> 24:16.846
'Jim knew that Ann was out
of their relationship long ago.'

24:16.933 --> 24:18.979
'The two of them came
to an understanding.'

24:19.066 --> 24:20.459
'He was married to his job.'

24:20.546 --> 24:22.765
'So what me and Ann
have between us..'

24:22.852 --> 24:25.072
...it's nobody's
business but our own.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.943
Been doing a little
work on the place?

24:28.379 --> 24:32.166
- No.
- Look at this.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.342
You see, the footprints
going that way

24:34.429 --> 24:36.344
are deeper than the footprints
coming this way.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.911
Yeah?

24:37.998 --> 24:39.652
Which means that someone
carried something heavy

24:39.739 --> 24:42.655
into your garage
but they didn't bring it out.

24:52.055 --> 24:55.276
Whoo! Look at you.
You got some stuff.

24:58.627 --> 24:59.715
Freezer.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.068
That is nice.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.681
Oh!

25:08.768 --> 25:11.597
[dramatic music]

25:25.219 --> 25:27.221
Let's start at 8:00 P.M.,
the night Jim Meier was murdered

25:27.308 --> 25:29.832
and stuffed in your fridge.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.618
I called Ann from the casino
at around 8:00 P.M.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.577
when I saw that Jim's car was
still parked at the resort.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.840
Now that normally meant
that he was staying the night

25:37.927 --> 25:40.321
so we agreed to meet
at 12:30 that night.

25:40.408 --> 25:41.496
But you left work
at 11:00 P.M.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.019
What did you do
with the 90 minutes?

25:43.106 --> 25:46.327
I went home, changed clothes
and just relaxed a while.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.721
Calida's a small town.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.853
There was plenty of time for
you and Ann to bash his head in

25:50.940 --> 25:52.812
dump the hand and hide the body
before going to your hideaway.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.509
I never meet Ann
at my house.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.945
That's very
delicate of you.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.644
We always met at
the Piney Branch Motel.

25:58.731 --> 26:02.386
It's on Route 6.
That's where we were that night.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.172
The M.E. says Jim was killed
sometime between the hours

26:05.259 --> 26:06.913
of 10:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.524
That's right in the sweet
spot of your free time.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.743
I didn't kill him.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.093
Was she giving you
half his estate?

26:13.180 --> 26:15.182
I have my own money.
I don't need any of Jim's.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.314
- But you needed his wife.
- It's not like that.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.838
It's exactly like that.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.361
You wanted Jim's life

26:20.448 --> 26:22.232
so you took it out
from under him.

26:22.319 --> 26:25.845
Look, the last time
I saw Jim

26:25.932 --> 26:27.629
he was watching
his whale tapes.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.850
He gets all of his
surveillance footage on DVD's

26:30.937 --> 26:33.026
and he watches it
night and day.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.810
Trying to figure out
what makes them tick.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.333
Keep 'em on the hook.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.945
Jim was obsessed
with the casino.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.469
That's what he loved, not Ann.

26:44.733 --> 26:47.301
He didn't care
what she did.

26:47.388 --> 26:50.043
Lisbon, we got the autopsy
report back on Meier.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.262
Died of blunt force
trauma to the head.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.873
Apparently, he was
hit several times

26:53.960 --> 26:57.006
with a heavy cylindrical
object like a pipe or a bat.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.921
There were also abrasions around
his neck like something

26:59.008 --> 27:02.664
was ripped off, his $100,000
poker chip, I assume.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.231
Check the Piney Branch Motel

27:04.318 --> 27:05.885
see if Ann Meier
and Matt Etienne

27:05.972 --> 27:06.929
were there when he
said they were.

27:07.016 --> 27:08.409
Okay.

27:08.496 --> 27:11.455
Rigsby, Jim Meier was
spying on his guests

27:11.542 --> 27:13.109
kept all the footage on DVD.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.937
Maybe he saw something
he shouldn't have.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.939
Go to his office and see
if you can locate the footage.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.201
Yes, boss.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.420
And check up on Jane.

27:23.293 --> 27:26.253
[upbeat music]

27:26.340 --> 27:27.558
- Thank you, darlin'.
- You're welcome.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.648
Gentlemen, this is
my friend Patrick Jane

27:29.735 --> 27:32.128
come to play cards with us,
if everyone's agreeable.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.176
Good to see you.
You want a sandwich?

27:36.263 --> 27:38.004
Hey, Freddy, bring
over some sandwiches.

27:38.091 --> 27:41.747
- Kiss my ass.
- Sit down. Sit down.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.273
You want to play too,
Danny boy?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.535
Thought I might.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.891
How you feeling, Goldilocks?
Feeling lucky?

27:55.978 --> 27:59.025
I'm sorry. Are we here to share
our feelings or to play cards?

27:59.112 --> 28:01.592
Bold!
Watch out,Freddy.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.304
- Anything over there?
- I got nada.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.697
We're gonna have
to go through these books.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.136
Who are you calling?

28:23.223 --> 28:26.487
Aces and threes.

28:26.574 --> 28:28.445
[telephone ringing]

28:28.532 --> 28:30.665
Flush wins.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.145
[clearing throat]

28:32.232 --> 28:34.843
Ah, new girlfriend.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.715
- Jane.
- Ask him how much he's winning.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.586
[Jane]
'Not the best timing.'

28:38.673 --> 28:41.110
Just deal me out of this
next hand, please.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.591
Oh, we'll wait.

28:43.678 --> 28:47.073
- 'What are you doing?'
- Harpooning a whale. Talk fast.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.596
'Yeah, we're in Meier's
work office.'

28:48.683 --> 28:50.990
He was watching a surveillance
DVD the night he died.

28:51.077 --> 28:54.907
We think it might be in a book,
but there's about 500 books.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.386
Are they in any
kind of order?

28:56.473 --> 28:59.999
Yeah, there's a lot
of military history

29:00.086 --> 29:02.131
gaming theory,
reference section.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.743
Try the bible or
"Robert's Rules Of Order."

29:04.830 --> 29:06.266
Okay, thanks.

29:06.353 --> 29:09.356
Hey, how much have you..
He didn't say.

29:09.443 --> 29:12.620
Sorry about that.
Nice win.

29:12.707 --> 29:15.014
- Women.
- Yeah, women.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.538
A 1,000 to you, sir.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.281
There we go.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.503
I don't care what he says.
That man is psychic.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.635
Right.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.247
Room 706.
That's Cal Trask's suite.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.511
- Whoa.
- I see her.

29:34.598 --> 29:35.556
Working girl.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.302
She looks familiar, though.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.398
Why, that's Jessica Meier,
isn't it?

29:51.485 --> 29:53.008
The victim's daughter?

29:53.095 --> 29:55.924
Dressed for a party.
There's no cake or balloons.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.846
Here's you arriving
at Trask's hotel suite

30:04.933 --> 30:07.414
at 1:30 in the morning.

30:07.501 --> 30:10.634
And here's you leaving
45 minutes later.

30:13.463 --> 30:14.551
Care to comment on that?

30:14.638 --> 30:16.815
No.
Where did you get this?

30:16.902 --> 30:18.773
From the way you're dressed
it appears

30:18.860 --> 30:20.166
that some sort of sexual
transaction took place.

30:20.253 --> 30:23.256
- No.
- Okay, I was guessing.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.301
- What did take place?
- Nothing.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.523
We looked into your financial
situation. It's bad.

30:29.610 --> 30:32.569
You and your husband are
swimming in credit card debt.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.310
You've refinanced
your house three times

30:34.397 --> 30:35.442
in the past two years.

30:35.529 --> 30:36.660
You've even had
a car repossessed.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.358
We hit a rough patch.

30:38.445 --> 30:39.968
Why?
Where'd the money go?

30:42.536 --> 30:44.059
Daniel is
a professional gambler.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.106
He has his ups
and downs, you know..

30:47.193 --> 30:48.194
...as in any business.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.415
Jessica, your father was
watching this video

30:52.502 --> 30:53.677
the night he died.

30:57.507 --> 31:00.162
- Oh, my God.
- What does that make you think?

31:03.992 --> 31:06.038
I don't know.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.910
Makes me think this video had
something to do with his death.

31:16.004 --> 31:17.005
All in.

31:21.357 --> 31:22.489
Call.

31:27.624 --> 31:28.582
Call.

31:37.025 --> 31:37.939
Three eight's.

31:43.771 --> 31:46.121
- 'Full house.'
- Damn.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.646
Trip nine's.
Full house wins.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.868
- Sorry, Cal.
- You got me, kid.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.304
Guess so.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.918
One win each.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.094
You and me are gonna
have to play a decider.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.834
Sure thing.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.882
- Patrick.
- Cal.

32:09.536 --> 32:10.537
Goodnight, Freddy.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.460
Man, we took him
for a lot of money.

32:20.547 --> 32:23.811
Yes, we did. I took most of it,
but you didn't do too bad.

32:23.898 --> 32:26.248
Horse pucky, dude.
It was me who skinned him.

32:26.335 --> 32:27.336
Whatever, kid.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.906
Let's go.
Heads-up.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.690
Oh, no, no.
Rain check for me.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.130
What's the matter, my friend?

32:38.217 --> 32:39.479
You scared?

32:42.786 --> 32:44.266
Open up a fresh pack,
Nancy, would you?

32:49.445 --> 32:50.751
- Cal Trask?
- Hmm?

32:50.838 --> 32:53.319
- We're CBI Agents.
- Good for you.

32:53.406 --> 32:54.842
We're investigating
the murder of James Meier.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.844
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

32:56.931 --> 32:59.716
Oh.. Ask 'em quick.
I've been up for 48 hours.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.414
I just lost a $180,000.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.590
I need to brush my
teeth and go to bed.

33:07.115 --> 33:08.334
Jim was spying on me?

33:09.726 --> 33:13.034
On all his VIP guests,
24/7.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.731
This is what he was
watching the night he died.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.734
Son of a bitch.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.823
Explain for us the nature
of your relationship

33:19.910 --> 33:20.999
with Jessica Meier-Cardeira.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.654
It's a large question.
Hard to say.

33:24.741 --> 33:27.527
Okay, more specifically,
why did she come to your room

33:27.614 --> 33:29.007
in the middle of the night
dressed like a hooker?

33:30.443 --> 33:32.619
I think I'll hold
my peace on that.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.013
If she has something she wants
to tell you, she will, I guess.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.450
We're thinking maybe
Jim was peeved.

33:37.537 --> 33:38.799
'Maybe he came to have
a word with you about'

33:38.886 --> 33:40.975
screwing his
only daughter.

33:41.062 --> 33:44.413
Maybe things escalated,
and maybe you got in a fight.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.677
- Accidents happen.
- Your thinking is wrong.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.508
You can see
how it looks, though.

33:56.686 --> 34:00.560
Okay. Stop the train.
I'll get off here.

34:02.388 --> 34:03.650
The night before this happened

34:03.737 --> 34:05.391
I was playing at
a table-stakes game

34:05.478 --> 34:08.263
with Daniel, her husband.

34:08.350 --> 34:11.484
Man's a degenerate gambler.
Degenerate.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.616
Anyway, I cleaned him out,
but he wouldn't quit.

34:13.703 --> 34:16.054
Wants to keep playing,
but he's got no collateral

34:16.141 --> 34:18.186
and I don't trust
him for an IOU.

34:18.273 --> 34:23.061
So he says he'll put up
his wife against 50 grand.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.413
The sexual favors of his wife.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.154
As collateral on
a poker game?

34:29.241 --> 34:30.242
Yep.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.724
So I said sure,
I mean, action's action.

34:34.811 --> 34:38.119
And Jessica Meier
is a nice piece of pie.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.777
She's very attractive.

34:43.864 --> 34:48.260
Yeah. Anyway, Daniel
and I play again.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.436
Naturally, I beat him again.

34:50.523 --> 34:53.526
He backed his word.
I'll give him that.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.441
He said he was gonna send her
over to my room the next night

34:55.528 --> 34:56.485
and he did.

34:58.052 --> 35:01.403
The man's a second-rate
card player but he knows

35:01.490 --> 35:02.796
how to control his womenfolk.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.668
She came to your room,
and then what?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.322
I took what was owed me.

35:07.409 --> 35:08.715
You had sexual
intercourse with her?

35:11.587 --> 35:14.895
- Yeah.
- How did she feel about that?

35:14.982 --> 35:18.203
Huh, not super enthusiastic.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.031
Willing.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.776
One hundred percent, willing.

35:28.648 --> 35:29.953
But not happy.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.872
Hey, a bet's a bet, right?

[instrumental music]

[music continues]

36:04.684 --> 36:06.251
So I have to win this
hand to stay in, huh?

36:06.338 --> 36:08.122
Uh, I guess you do.

Two thousand.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.258
Call.

36:59.347 --> 37:00.305
Excuse me.

37:09.139 --> 37:10.315
I'll take one.

37:17.104 --> 37:18.888
Two. Thank you.

37:32.859 --> 37:33.860
That good, huh?

37:37.080 --> 37:39.474
Oh, wow.
That good.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.042
That good.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.783
I can't lose.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.525
Well, it's a shame you got
diddly-squat to bet with.

37:47.874 --> 37:50.746
[music continues]

37:54.707 --> 37:56.186
What's the bet, kid?

38:02.671 --> 38:04.064
I forgot.

38:11.332 --> 38:15.684
The bet, my friend,
is $105,000.

38:30.438 --> 38:33.920
One hundred and five.

38:35.617 --> 38:36.662
And I see you.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.580
You should trust me
when I tell you things.

38:41.667 --> 38:45.410
I told you I couldn't lose.
Four kings. Booyah!

38:47.499 --> 38:48.804
That's pretty.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.156
Not as pretty as this.

38:56.638 --> 38:59.119
- Straight flush.
- No.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.295
- Yes.
- That's impossible.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.602
- His pot.
- That's my pot.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.041
Look at this.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.262
I see you.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.353
'Yes, I do.'

39:23.752 --> 39:24.884
Whatever, man.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.583
Later.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.542
Not much later.

Let's go.

[music continues]

39:44.947 --> 39:46.862
Tell us, how did you end up

39:46.949 --> 39:48.560
with Jim Meier's
lucky poker chip?

That night,

39:52.564 --> 39:55.523
Jim followed me
to the parking lot.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.133
'He'd seen this tape
with Jessica and Cal.'

39:57.220 --> 40:00.702
'And he knew I must have
something to do with it.'

40:00.789 --> 40:03.792
'I said, sure I did.
Screw him.'

40:03.879 --> 40:06.882
'Like he was such a great
husband and father, you know?'

40:06.969 --> 40:09.668
'He called me a degenerate
low-life pimp fired me'

40:09.755 --> 40:11.234
'and he said he'd do
everything in his power'

40:11.321 --> 40:14.324
'to get me out
of Jessica's life.'

40:14.412 --> 40:15.543
'I couldn't let that happen.'

40:18.111 --> 40:19.460
'I remembered the stories
they told in the room'

40:19.547 --> 40:21.157
'about the mafia hit men
leaving a hand behind'

40:21.244 --> 40:22.985
'as a message, you know?'

40:23.072 --> 40:25.423
'I did it to make 'em
think it was mob-related.'

40:28.164 --> 40:29.949
I dumped the body at Matt's,
'cause I knew his affair

40:30.036 --> 40:31.690
with Ann would
come to light.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.387
Did your wife have
anything to do with this?

40:33.474 --> 40:34.562
No. No.

40:34.649 --> 40:35.955
She had nothing
to do with this.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.612
And the idiot never
suspected it was me.

40:40.699 --> 40:41.613
How's that for denial?

40:44.529 --> 40:45.747
How did you know it was me?

40:45.834 --> 40:47.923
Well, when we first met

40:48.010 --> 40:50.491
you were more concerned about
the college football scores

40:50.578 --> 40:51.536
than you were your
father-in-law's murder.

40:51.623 --> 40:52.928
So?

40:53.015 --> 40:55.017
So when you're
searching for a killer

40:55.104 --> 40:56.192
the degenerate
gambler in the room

40:56.279 --> 40:57.933
is a good person to look at.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.066
I'm not a degenerate.
I'm a professional.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.678
I'm just having
a streak of bad luck.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.071
Yes, you are.

41:06.768 --> 41:07.769
Let's go.

41:09.771 --> 41:11.381
That last hand,
how'd you do that?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.297
Stand up.
Put your hands behind your head.

41:14.384 --> 41:17.387
- Oh, uh, I cheated.
- But how?

41:17.475 --> 41:19.477
Next time we play,
I'll show you.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.089
It's okay, baby.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.482
It's gonna be okay.

41:38.626 --> 41:39.758
I believe this is yours.

41:41.716 --> 41:42.630
Thank you.

41:57.166 --> 41:59.821
Your father died
protecting you.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.910
So in the end, he..

42:01.997 --> 42:03.912
...he was there for you.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.087
Thank you.

money you won in that game.

Oh, I don't know, $300,000,
something like that.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.875
- Wow.
- So where is it, the money?

42:55.181 --> 42:57.183
- I spent it.
- On what?

42:57.270 --> 42:59.272
You know, stuff.

A really cute blonde guy left
this for you at the front desk.
