00:02.085 --> 00:03.921
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:03.963 --> 00:06.841
Reese's had the remote

00:03.963 --> 00:06.841
for four hours.

00:06.882 --> 00:10.051
That's four hours of mindless

00:06.882 --> 00:10.051
crap in five-second increments.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.053
You go to the bathroom,

00:10.093 --> 00:12.053
you lose the remote.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.263
Fine.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.933
I can wait.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.309
I don't know.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.269
You drank a lot of soda...

00:17.351 --> 00:19.269
it must really be pushing

00:19.311 --> 00:21.104
up against

00:19.311 --> 00:21.104
the walls of your bladder.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.773
Not going to work.

00:22.815 --> 00:26.067
And then, I had four glasses

00:22.815 --> 00:26.067
of Dad's iced tea.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.988
He just kept pouring...

00:26.109 --> 00:28.988
and pouring...

00:29.029 --> 00:30.656
Not going to work.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.575
The equivalent of three

00:30.698 --> 00:33.575
semi trailers of water

00:33.617 --> 00:36.077
pour over the falls

00:33.617 --> 00:36.077
every second.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.788
Not going to work.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.081

00:40.123 --> 00:44.378
Not... going to.... work!

to be able to look at.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.526
Don't move.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.029
Just spend a couple

01:49.568 --> 01:52.029
of days with Grandma.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.155
You can leave

01:52.071 --> 01:54.155
right after Christmas.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.033
I am not visiting that woman.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.409
She's evil and she hates me.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.078
Francis, this is family.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.580
This is Grandma's first

01:59.119 --> 02:01.580
Christmas since Grandpa died

02:01.622 --> 02:02.581
and you live the closest.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.999
How can you be so selfish?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.126
Well, did you invite her

02:04.041 --> 02:06.126
to  your  house?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.212
She knows she's always welcome.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.048
Hey, maybe we'll both

02:09.254 --> 02:11.048
get on a bus

02:11.090 --> 02:12.215
and come down and surprise you.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.217
Don't you threaten me.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.971
I am ending this discussion.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.889
You are going to Whitehorse.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.181
You are going to the drugstore

02:20.223 --> 02:22.183
to buy her a gift,

02:20.223 --> 02:22.183
and you are both

pathetic charade.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.952
I never know what

04:01.241 --> 04:03.952
you're talking about.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.913

To hurt me?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.299
You don't like

04:17.007 --> 04:18.299
Christmas music?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.010
It sounds like

04:18.341 --> 04:20.010
a song they sang

04:20.052 --> 04:22.303
when they would ride

04:20.052 --> 04:22.303
through the villages

04:22.345 --> 04:24.305
and throw the babies

04:22.345 --> 04:24.305
into the fire.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.391
They sang "Jingle Bells"?

04:26.433 --> 04:29.144
They sang something.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.150
Well, look at that-- 8:00

04:32.397 --> 04:35.150
already, way past my bedtime.

You're sitting on it.

Yes, it becomes a bed.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.324
It's a special, magic sofa.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.620
It opens up for

04:43.366 --> 04:46.620
magic, lazy boy

04:46.661 --> 04:49.330
and angels come

04:46.661 --> 04:49.330
and feed you grapes

04:49.372 --> 04:51.833
and sing to you

04:49.372 --> 04:51.833
while you sleep

04:51.875 --> 04:55.045

07:35.455 --> 07:36.957
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

07:36.998 --> 07:39.500
You can't wait to get your hands

07:36.998 --> 07:39.500
on my things.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.502
Oh, yeah, Grandma, I got

07:39.542 --> 07:41.502
big plans for these doilies

07:41.544 --> 07:43.130
and I really want

07:41.544 --> 07:43.130
that can of peaches

07:43.171 --> 07:44.798
that's been on your shelf

07:43.171 --> 07:44.798
for 30 years.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.507
Don't touch my peaches.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.509
Oh, like I'm

07:46.549 --> 07:48.509
really going to touch...

07:48.551 --> 07:51.096
(distant singing)

07:51.138 --> 07:53.556
(coughing)

07:53.598 --> 07:56.310
(carolers singing

07:53.598 --> 07:56.310
"Carol of the Bells")

07:56.351 --> 07:57.811
Stop your racket!

07:57.852 --> 08:00.563
Decent people are trying

07:57.852 --> 08:00.563
to sleep!

08:00.605 --> 08:02.190
You stupid music!

08:02.232 --> 08:05.485
There is no figgy pudding

08:02.232 --> 08:05.485
for you here!

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
Please pass

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
the syrup, please.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.704
Thank you.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.206
You are very welcome.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.540
More coffee?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.540
Please.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.460
I'll get it for you, Mom.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.460
That's okay.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.129
Well, then, I hope you'll let us

08:21.501 --> 08:24.129
wash the dishes.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.546
We'd love to!

08:24.171 --> 08:25.546
Absolutely!

08:25.588 --> 08:27.966
Now, that, I'll take you up on.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.551
I think we can do this.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.013
It's Christmas Eve,

08:30.593 --> 08:33.013
and we've behaved for ten hours.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.806
Okay, eight were sleep,

08:33.054 --> 08:34.806
but still.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.766
We can make it through

08:34.848 --> 08:36.766
another 24, right?

08:36.808 --> 08:37.851
Who wants the last waffle?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.311
DEWEY AND REESE:

08:37.892 --> 08:39.311
I do!

08:40.812 --> 08:41.771
Oh, no!

08:42.647 --> 08:45.025
You know, I would really

08:45.066 --> 08:46.985
like that waffle.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.570
Yes, but I am a growing boy.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.657
Perhaps it would be best

08:49.612 --> 08:52.657
if I had the waffle.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.544
Thanks for

09:02.459 --> 09:04.544
offering it to me, boys.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.216
They are such good boys.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.137
(accordion music

09:11.009 --> 09:14.137
playing over TV)

09:19.642 --> 09:21.602
("Jingle Bells" playing)

09:21.644 --> 09:23.813
(song stops)

09:26.649 --> 09:28.568
(song plays and stops)

09:31.363 --> 09:32.572
(song plays)

09:32.906 --> 09:34.199
Ow!

09:34.241 --> 09:35.783
God, what the hell is wrong

09:34.241 --> 09:35.783
with you?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.411
You like pushing me?

09:37.452 --> 09:39.620
That's what happens when

09:37.452 --> 09:39.620
you push, big, tough guy.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.124
Can't you do the entire family

09:39.662 --> 09:43.124
a favor and just die?!

09:43.166 --> 09:46.461
All you have ever done

09:43.166 --> 09:46.461
is treat us like dirt!

09:46.503 --> 09:48.629
You shouldn't even be

09:46.503 --> 09:48.629
allowed to be a grandma.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.131
Are you finished?

09:50.173 --> 09:51.425
Yes, I am...

09:51.466 --> 09:53.634
(screams, groans)

09:53.676 --> 09:56.137
Oh, I am so sorry.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.847
Oh...

09:57.889 --> 10:01.560
I should have kissed your

09:57.889 --> 10:01.560
boo-boos and made them better.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.810
I was supposed to tell

10:02.852 --> 10:04.645
the bad little boy stories

10:04.687 --> 10:06.273
and bake you giant sugar cookies

10:06.314 --> 10:09.276
and knit you nice,

10:06.314 --> 10:09.276
fluffy sweaters.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.069
I should have carried you

10:09.317 --> 10:11.069
and held you

10:11.111 --> 10:14.448
and told you how much

10:11.111 --> 10:14.448
I loved your diapers.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.742
Why don't you just unhinge

10:14.489 --> 10:17.742
your jaw and finish me off?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.579
After my  Magnum, P.I.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.081
Lois! I'm home!

10:26.751 --> 10:28.044
Now, honey,

10:28.086 --> 10:29.546
I know I'm not

10:28.086 --> 10:29.546
supposed to do this

10:29.588 --> 10:31.131
but I saw something

10:29.588 --> 10:31.131
in the store today

10:31.172 --> 10:32.299
and I had

10:31.172 --> 10:32.299
to get it for you.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.550
It's a little more than

10:33.592 --> 10:35.093
we agreed we would

10:33.592 --> 10:35.093
spend on each other

10:35.135 --> 10:36.677
but I figured hey,

10:35.135 --> 10:36.677
it's Christmas.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.139
We have the whole rest of

10:36.719 --> 10:39.139
the year to follow the rules.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.266
It's beautiful.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.684
I mean, isn't that what

10:41.308 --> 10:43.684
this season is all about?

10:43.726 --> 10:47.105
You know, relaxing, enjoying

10:43.726 --> 10:47.105
things, making people happy?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.275
Hal, that's so

10:47.147 --> 10:50.275
sweet and thoughtful.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.402
I hope I get to open it.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.907
Rats!

10:59.117 --> 11:00.701
You're doing it all wrong.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.537
You have

11:00.743 --> 11:02.537
seven ornaments.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.704
I'm putting them

11:02.579 --> 11:03.704
on your tree.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.705
How could I do it wrong?

11:04.747 --> 11:07.542
Go get the angel off mantel.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.424
Who's this?

11:14.466 --> 11:18.470
That is your grandfather,

11:14.466 --> 11:18.470
when he was young man.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.308
Ugh! Tell me that eyebrow thing

11:20.013 --> 11:23.308
isn't genetic.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.186
You and him--

11:23.350 --> 11:26.186
both the same.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.729
Always had to have

11:26.227 --> 11:28.729
your own way;

11:28.771 --> 11:30.190
nothing ever good enough.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.026
Always have

11:30.231 --> 11:33.026
to fight everything.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.946
Victor always had to be

11:33.067 --> 11:36.946
so independent.

11:36.988 --> 11:41.159
Left home when he was 11,

11:36.988 --> 11:41.159
lived on his own.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.743
Got work on a farm

11:42.785 --> 11:45.830
plowing the fields,

11:42.785 --> 11:45.830
like a man.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.957
Worked 18 hours a day.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.792
Had to sleep

11:47.999 --> 11:49.792
with the pigs

11:49.834 --> 11:53.547
but he never complained.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.755
He was strong.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.757
(grunting)

11:56.799 --> 11:58.885
He made something of himself.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.180
Nobody's like

12:00.178 --> 12:02.180
that anymore.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.184
Everybody's too soft.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.727
Hey, Grandma, why don't you

12:06.226 --> 12:08.727
let me help you with that?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.440
Your grandfather was tough.

12:12.482 --> 12:16.695
He didn't take anything

12:12.482 --> 12:16.695
from anybody.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.408
(slurring): He was... proud.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.411
A man of... honor.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.788
He was a wonderful...

12:27.830 --> 12:32.085
wonderful man.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.339
Victor...

12:37.840 --> 12:40.885
du kaya mischna...

12:42.845 --> 12:45.764
Grandma?

12:47.684 --> 12:48.893
Grandma?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.520
Oh!

12:52.813 --> 12:54.190
Oh, God!

12:54.232 --> 12:55.442
(snoring quietly)

12:57.151 --> 12:59.279
Ugh!

13:03.700 --> 13:05.285
(groans)

13:05.326 --> 13:06.827
Just one more night.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.829
We can get through one night.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.829
(laughs nervously)

13:08.871 --> 13:10.498
We should be proud

13:08.871 --> 13:10.498
of ourselves.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.750
Everything's put away.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.251
We haven't had

13:11.790 --> 13:13.251
a single fight.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.835
We did it.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.296
We're going to get presents?

13:16.337 --> 13:17.547
We're going to get presents.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.507
What do we do now?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.259
I guess we could take a nap.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.510
Or maybe play quietly--

13:22.552 --> 13:25.722
very quietly.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.931
(squeaking)

13:26.973 --> 13:28.224
(gasps)

13:28.266 --> 13:31.810
Shut up, Petey, shut up!

13:34.939 --> 13:37.858
God, I'll be so glad

13:34.939 --> 13:37.858
when Christmas is over.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.569
Yeah, we'll be safe

13:37.900 --> 13:39.569
for another year.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.488
Mom's doing this

13:39.611 --> 13:41.488
next Christmas?

13:41.529 --> 13:42.489
Why wouldn't she?

13:42.530 --> 13:43.782
It worked, didn't it?

13:43.822 --> 13:45.492
And what if it's

13:43.822 --> 13:45.492
not just Christmas?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.743
What do you mean?

13:46.785 --> 13:47.868
What if she does it

13:46.785 --> 13:47.868
for other things

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
like Halloween

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
or Fourth of July?

13:49.912 --> 13:50.955
Or our birthdays?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.248
She can't do this!

13:52.290 --> 13:53.792
I can't take it anymore.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.335
We have to do something

13:53.832 --> 13:55.335
to stop her.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.461
Something drastic.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.295
I'm in.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.713
Mom needs to know

13:58.755 --> 14:00.757
she can't take special

13:58.755 --> 14:00.757
occasions hostage.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.883
She needs to know

14:00.799 --> 14:02.883
we don't negotiate.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.345
She turned a beautiful

14:02.925 --> 14:05.345
family holiday

14:05.386 --> 14:07.888
into a nightmare.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.184
It's time we show her

14:07.930 --> 14:11.184
the true spirit of Christmas.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.704
Now, before you say anything,

14:28.827 --> 14:30.704
I don't want you

14:30.745 --> 14:32.205
to think of this

14:30.745 --> 14:32.205
as Christmas cider.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.624
This is nondenominational

14:32.246 --> 14:34.624
"winter" cider.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.710
Though the boys are doing

14:34.666 --> 14:36.710
so well, I...

14:36.751 --> 14:38.586
(crying)

14:38.628 --> 14:39.920
Lois?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.922
I'm a terrible mother.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.385
I shouldn't be allowed

14:41.964 --> 14:45.385
to have children.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.386
Oh, sweetie...

14:46.427 --> 14:47.928
I ruined Christmas.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.764
What do you mean?

14:49.806 --> 14:51.932
The boys are behaving like

14:49.806 --> 14:51.932
I never knew they could behave.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.100
I thought

14:51.974 --> 14:53.100
that's what you wanted.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.603
Yeah, but I didn't

14:53.142 --> 14:55.603
want it like this.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.980
I wanted to take it

14:55.645 --> 14:57.980
back five minutes

14:58.022 --> 14:59.816
after I starting

14:58.022 --> 14:59.816
grabbing those presents,

14:59.858 --> 15:02.026
but I didn't know how.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.320
I'm a monster.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.864
No, no, you're not monster.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.948
I am. I really am.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.200
No, you're not a monster.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.870
Why don't you just

15:09.242 --> 15:11.870
admit I'm a monster!

15:11.911 --> 15:14.205
All right, in this

15:11.911 --> 15:14.205
particular case,

15:14.247 --> 15:15.540
you're a monster.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.624
I know.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.625
(crying)

15:17.667 --> 15:19.001
(phone rings)

15:19.043 --> 15:21.379
Just let the machine get it.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.759
Come on, you know how

15:21.421 --> 15:25.759
when you cry it makes me cry.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.636
You are

15:25.800 --> 15:28.636
a wonderful mother.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.971
And you're a wonderful person.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.891
(over answering machine):

15:31.013 --> 15:32.891
Hey, Mom, it's Francis.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.225
I just want you to know

15:32.932 --> 15:34.225
that I am disgusted

15:34.267 --> 15:35.769
with the way you treat Grandma.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.978
Abandoning a helpless

15:35.810 --> 15:37.978
old woman at Christmas.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.022
I hope you're

15:38.020 --> 15:40.022
ashamed of yourself.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.234
I am. I am.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.486
Hal, the boys don't

15:43.276 --> 15:45.486
deserve this.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.988
I mean, they're a

15:45.528 --> 15:47.988
little high-spirited

15:48.030 --> 15:49.990
but they're good,

15:48.030 --> 15:49.990
good boys.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.827
God, this feels so right.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.914
This is way better

15:52.869 --> 15:55.914
than real Christmas.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.666
Remember, mess them

15:55.955 --> 15:58.666
up just enough

15:58.708 --> 16:00.919
so mom can't

15:58.708 --> 16:00.919
return them.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.045
Wait a minute.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.799
Mom got me the exact

16:03.087 --> 16:05.799
video game I asked for.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.969
These are better

16:05.840 --> 16:09.969
than what I asked for.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.013
You know what?

16:13.055 --> 16:16.016
Mom got me everything

16:13.055 --> 16:16.016
I wanted.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.018
Me, too.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.313
She listened to us.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.274
Okay, so she got lucky

16:20.354 --> 16:23.274
a few times.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.026
I never asked

16:23.316 --> 16:26.026
for a stupid globe.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.111
That's mine.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.113
The cleats are yours.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.490
Oh.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.743
Mom really tried this year.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.454
All she wanted

16:33.785 --> 16:36.454
was a nice Christmas

16:36.496 --> 16:37.831
and we ruined it.

16:37.872 --> 16:41.041
In all fairness,

16:37.872 --> 16:41.041
we ruin everything.

16:41.083 --> 16:45.045
Remember how happy we were

16:41.083 --> 16:45.045
a minute ago?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.881
How do we go back?

16:46.923 --> 16:48.132
I don't know.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.135
Do we have any paint left?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.262
No.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.016
Oh, well.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.646
What are you doing?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.105
I'm doing you a favor,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.566
so why don't you shut up

17:03.147 --> 17:05.566
and enjoy it.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.074
What is this?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.577
Oh, you don't want

17:14.116 --> 17:16.577
to look in there.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.704
It's too sad.

17:17.745 --> 17:18.705
No, Grandma,

17:18.746 --> 17:19.747
what are all these things?

17:19.789 --> 17:21.499
I mean, look at this.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.543
There must be, like, a thousand

17:21.541 --> 17:23.543
dollars worth of stuff in here.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.880
$2,735.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.590
$4,500 Canadian.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.175
What are they doing

17:29.632 --> 17:31.175
in your closet?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.677
They're gifts.

17:32.719 --> 17:36.096
For the family, for relatives,

17:32.719 --> 17:36.096
for friends.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.098
But you never give presents.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.098
You...

17:38.140 --> 17:40.935
Oh, my God, Donatello

17:38.140 --> 17:40.935
with pizza-throwing action.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.979
I wanted one of these

17:40.977 --> 17:42.979
when I was six.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.481
I know you did.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.481
I bought that for you.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.691
No, you didn't.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.817
Yes, I did.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.110
And then,

17:47.859 --> 17:50.110
right before Christmas,

17:50.152 --> 17:52.488
your Mommy

17:50.152 --> 17:52.488
put you on the phone

17:52.530 --> 17:54.615
you called me "poopie"

17:52.530 --> 17:54.615
and hung up.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.118
Is that the bread maker

17:54.657 --> 17:58.118
Mom was asking for last year?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.328
If she wants bread so much

17:59.370 --> 18:00.496
she should write back

18:00.538 --> 18:03.833
when her mother writes to her.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.502
Oh, this was

18:03.875 --> 18:06.502
for Cousin Nikola.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.129
I spent a day shopping for it.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.966
Then she marries a Protestant.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.343
That camera, for your father,

18:14.385 --> 18:18.180
right before he refused to drive

18:14.385 --> 18:18.180
me to the liquor store-- ugh!

18:18.222 --> 18:23.143
All the nice things

18:18.222 --> 18:23.143
I do for people.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.146
Oh, my God, you're crazy!

18:26.188 --> 18:29.442
I just thought you were evil,

18:26.188 --> 18:29.442
but you are nuts!

18:29.483 --> 18:31.151
What are you talking about?

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
Gifts aren't conditional--

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
they're gifts!

18:33.195 --> 18:35.615
You give them to people

18:33.195 --> 18:35.615
because you love them.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.450
They're not something

18:35.656 --> 18:37.450
you can take away

18:37.491 --> 18:38.952
because of some petty slight.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.411
You're not

18:38.993 --> 18:40.411
teaching people anything.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.162
You haven't gotten back at them.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.873
They don't even know

18:42.204 --> 18:43.873
they've upset you.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.249
All you have done here is-is...

18:45.291 --> 18:48.377
constructed a monument

18:45.291 --> 18:48.377
to your own insanity!

18:48.419 --> 18:50.630
What kind of a person

18:48.419 --> 18:50.630
does that?!

18:50.671 --> 18:53.967
A lonely...

18:54.008 --> 18:56.803
bitter... old woman.

18:56.844 --> 18:57.804
What?!

18:57.845 --> 18:59.847
Look what I've done.

18:59.889 --> 19:04.143
What use is all these things

18:59.889 --> 19:04.143
to me now?

19:05.436 --> 19:07.480
They could have brought

19:05.436 --> 19:07.480
someone some happiness;

19:07.521 --> 19:09.189
instead, they rot here.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.608
(gasps)

19:11.525 --> 19:15.195
Grandma?

19:11.525 --> 19:15.195
My hea... heart.

19:15.237 --> 19:20.242
I... I think it's melting.

19:21.285 --> 19:25.247
Yes... it's melting.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.208
Oh... you showed me the way...

19:28.250 --> 19:31.211
Francis, by yelling at me.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.422
Quick, go get

19:31.253 --> 19:33.422
my magic sled

19:33.464 --> 19:37.093
and me and my reindeers

19:33.464 --> 19:37.093
will go and give Christmas

19:37.135 --> 19:39.512
to all the mean,

19:37.135 --> 19:39.512
stupid, rude people.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.222
We'll all join hands

19:39.553 --> 19:42.222
and sing songs.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.474
And we'll sprinkle

19:43.516 --> 19:44.934
the ingrates with fairy dust

19:44.976 --> 19:46.144
and my...

19:46.185 --> 19:47.728
Are you sure

19:46.185 --> 19:47.728
you want to do this?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.647
Yes. I don't know

19:47.770 --> 19:49.647
what I was thinking;

19:49.689 --> 19:51.440
taking presents

19:49.689 --> 19:51.440
away from children?

19:51.482 --> 19:54.068
What kind of a sick

19:51.482 --> 19:54.068
person does that?

19:54.110 --> 19:56.529
Look, I just want to get

19:54.110 --> 19:56.529
everything out of the garage

19:56.570 --> 19:59.073
set it up in the house,

19:56.570 --> 19:59.073
and have a nice Christmas.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.825
You know what?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.910
Why don't we wake up the boys

20:00.867 --> 20:02.910
and have Christmas tonight?

20:02.952 --> 20:06.914
I can't wait to see the look

20:02.952 --> 20:06.914
on their sweet little faces.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.262
Well, Hal, that was...

20:22.304 --> 20:25.892
smart of you to

20:22.304 --> 20:25.892
wake up the boys

20:25.933 --> 20:31.105
so they could help us

20:25.933 --> 20:31.105
carry in the presents.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.274
Yes... yes... uh...

20:34.316 --> 20:37.195
well, come on,

20:34.316 --> 20:37.195
come on, hurry up, boys.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.239
Yeah.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.239
Sure.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.239
Okay.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.626
(card playing "Jingle Bells")

20:54.378 --> 20:57.798
I'll cut off his hands and stick

20:54.378 --> 20:57.798
them in his  kakooshnyik.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.137
(grunting and groaning)

21:06.432 --> 21:09.268
(music stops)

21:11.395 --> 21:14.565
(another musical card

21:11.395 --> 21:14.565
starts playing in distance)

21:14.607 --> 21:17.317
Yoric greblech!

21:17.359 --> 21:18.819
(gasps)

21:18.861 --> 21:20.154
Roller skates!

21:20.196 --> 21:21.948
Oh, I hope you like

21:20.196 --> 21:21.948
them, sweetie.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.409
Ooh, I think we have another

21:21.989 --> 21:25.409
present here for Reese.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.120
I wonder what it is.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.413
This really is the best

21:27.161 --> 21:29.413
Christmas we've ever had.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.165
I don't know why we didn't try

21:31.207 --> 21:32.583
this whole denial thing

21:31.207 --> 21:32.583
a long time ago.
