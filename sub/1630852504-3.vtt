WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:04.169
And I know how to find
jackie sullivan.

00:04.304 --> 00:06.905
- It's hard to wrangle
an 18-year-old.

00:06.907 --> 00:09.441
- I know what it's like to have
a 17-year-old son, so...

00:09.477 --> 00:12.110
- That wazowski one's got a son
she can't control.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.613
Name's elliot. Look him up.
(doorbell ringing)

00:14.615 --> 00:17.816
I am looking for comradery,
and companionship,

00:17.852 --> 00:20.318
And the intercourse
is also on my list.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.621
- How about I keep it
running for you?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.656
Just tell the guys in buffalo
it's status quo.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.259
- When they do finally
give me my job back,

00:27.328 --> 00:28.794
You can't abandon me, ok?

00:28.796 --> 00:30.862
- Buffalo is going to
give you a try,

00:30.898 --> 00:33.365
But you gotta get
the bowens on board.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.401
- These are the bowen brothers:
Randy bowen, steph bowen.

00:36.470 --> 00:40.038
You are a guppy. What I want
to know is, who is the shark?

00:43.410 --> 00:46.277
♪♪

00:46.313 --> 00:49.214
(knocking on door)
- hold on!

00:49.283 --> 00:51.617
(sighing)

00:51.752 --> 00:54.152
I said "hold on."
what are you doing here?

00:54.288 --> 00:56.688
- Hello! Surprise!

00:56.757 --> 00:58.757
Guess what happened? You're
never gonna guess what happened.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.758
I met this guy online,
his name is ronaldo

01:00.795 --> 01:02.694
And he planned this coffee date
right around the corner

01:02.763 --> 01:04.629
From you. Guess what,
guess who didn't show?

01:04.698 --> 01:07.366
Oh, I don't know, ronaldo!
So, would you like his coffee?

01:07.368 --> 01:10.302
You're welcome.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.437
Ok, good story about that:

01:12.506 --> 01:15.841
It's just that when he didn't
show, and then I realized like,

01:15.843 --> 01:17.642
Oh my god, I am around
the corner from kelly,

01:17.678 --> 01:19.444
I gotta go over and say 'hi,'
because that would be rude

01:19.480 --> 01:21.179
If I didn't say 'hi' to you,
so here I am,

01:21.315 --> 01:23.181
And I am saying 'hello!"
look at us with our coffees!

01:23.250 --> 01:24.917
Oh, my gosh! I didn't realize
you had sciatica.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.519
- What are you talking about?
- It's spinal nerve compression.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.255
- I have a bad back, ok?
- No, you need a foam roller.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.257
Do you have one? I'm guessing
no. Guess what I just did?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.726
I primed you one.
See you in an hour,

01:34.862 --> 01:36.728
You know what I'm saying?
- I'm never gonna use it.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.397
- Yes, you are.
Holy moly, look at this!

01:39.399 --> 01:41.800
This is one fully stocked
liquor cabinet.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.536
Do you have a drinking problem?
If you do, I want you to know
that you can talk to me.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.738
- I don't have a drinking
problem, all right?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.675
A shot of whiskey at the end
of a long day isn't a problem,

01:49.677 --> 01:52.344
It's a blessing. And it's
something that you should try.

01:52.479 --> 01:56.681
- Oh, look at this!
Whose sweater is this?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.750
- Give me that.
- Oh my gosh, that smells nice.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.285
- And it belongs to nana.
- Nana?

02:00.420 --> 02:02.521
Are you dating someone
called nana? Nana who?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.489
- (sighing): None
of your business.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.892
- Ok, well, that's...
Oh, look at this!

02:06.894 --> 02:09.361
A record collector! I didn't
take you for a record collector!

02:09.363 --> 02:11.996
That's a good band!
- You're not even trying to hide

02:12.032 --> 02:13.965
The fact that you're being nosy.
- No, I'm trying to...

02:14.034 --> 02:15.567
Hide something else.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.770
- Which is?

02:18.772 --> 02:20.839
- Which is...

02:20.974 --> 02:23.241
Listen, there's no ronaldo.
Ronaldo doesn't exist.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.777
I just-I really wanted
to come by early

02:25.913 --> 02:27.845
To talk to you before work

02:27.882 --> 02:29.781
Because I wanted
to pay you a compliment.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.118
- Oh. Ok.
Well, I'm listening.

02:33.253 --> 02:36.187
- I think we work well together.
Really well together.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.857
Having you alongside enhances
my already proficient skillset.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.193
- It sounds like you're paying
yourself a compliment.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.195
I'm still waiting on mine.
- You're a good cop.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.197
A really good cop.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.399
If we work as a team
to go after randy

02:47.401 --> 02:49.334
And steph bowen, we could
take down the stockwood crew.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.469
We could do it, duff!
We could do it together.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.005
- Randy and steph are
too protected. The only way

02:54.074 --> 02:56.275
To get them is to find a little
guy who's going to talk.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.344
- No more little guy.
Big fish only, remember?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.147
- The only way to catch a
big fish is to cast a wide net.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.550
- Single-line fishing.
Harpooning. More sustainable.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.685
- More time-consuming.
- More environmentally-friendly.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.753
- We're not really talking
about fish, are we?

03:08.789 --> 03:11.356
- No, we're talking about this.
Who is that man on your fridge?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.825
- All right.
- You have a dentist appointment

03:13.961 --> 03:15.827
On the 9th, are you sure?
Because we have a meeting--

03:15.829 --> 03:17.762
- Can you stop being
so nosy in my apartment?

03:17.798 --> 03:19.831
- Is that Italy?
You've really travelled!
- It's time to go.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.434
- I just brought over
the coffee and I thought
we could have a coffee...

03:22.569 --> 03:24.836
- Thank you. Get out.
- Do you need a drive?
I brought my car.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.239
I don't have my shoe!
I'll drive you to work!

03:27.374 --> 03:31.109
- ♪ yo pretty ladies
around the world ♪

03:31.178 --> 03:35.947

03:38.852 --> 03:40.785
- I say we go after danica.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.255
I bumped into her in a club
the other night. She liked me.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.790
She'd answer my call.
- Nah, bro, she's a lesbian.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.259
- Ok, maybe she didn't
like me<i> like me</i>

03:47.394 --> 03:49.061
Like that, but,
you know, we vibed.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.396
- That wasn't vibing.
That was pity.

03:51.531 --> 03:54.399
'cause your game is sad.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.536
- You know I'm going through a
divorce right now, so I am sad.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.538
And also, I wasn't really
trying to pick her up.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.606
I was trying to get her to trust
me, so maybe in that sense,

04:01.642 --> 04:03.608
My game is fresh.
- Ok.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.878
Yeah. Not convinced.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.414
I say we go

04:09.549 --> 04:13.151
For... Cisco.
- Hmm?

04:13.187 --> 04:16.288
- He's a mid-level ring leader.
And if we catch him,

04:16.357 --> 04:18.557
We're likely to pull up on
the rest of the stockwood crew.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.626
- We now know that rick gray
is the supplier

04:21.695 --> 04:25.030
For the stockwood crew. So, this
little bit of knowledge opens up

04:25.099 --> 04:26.932
A delicious can of worms

04:27.067 --> 04:28.767
Because all we have to do
is follow rick gray's movements

04:28.902 --> 04:31.036
To find out where he's
getting the drugs from.

04:31.038 --> 04:34.773
My theory? Wham! Bam!
Bill miciano!

04:34.908 --> 04:36.541
A lieutenant with
the buffalo crime family.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.344
We found security footage
of rick meeting miciano

04:39.479 --> 04:41.879
At capital falls casino,
just north of the border.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.182
Now, they have a meeting
in a private room

04:44.218 --> 04:46.651
Booked under rick's name
every second Tuesday.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.986
- We already caught rick gray!
- So, why does the rick gray

04:49.023 --> 04:51.356
Reservation at
capital falls still stand?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.792
- Maybe he bought a season pass.
I did that once.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.194
I lost a buttload of money,
you remem--

04:56.230 --> 04:58.830
- No, hamm, it's because miciano
is still meeting someone

04:58.899 --> 05:00.865
To keep that stockwood
pipeline going.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.801
Now I'm not a gambling woman,
but I am betting

05:02.803 --> 05:06.371
That steph or randy bowen
is taking rick gray's place.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.740
- Cool. Cisco.
So, what are you gonna do?

05:08.875 --> 05:11.109
Just like dm him, or...?
- Don't have to.

05:11.244 --> 05:15.947
'cause keegan's contact
lakyn sent me this.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.683
- "sick duck cisco,
selling out of mimico motel."

05:17.818 --> 05:19.618
- No, just--
- "no, I mean 'duck',

05:19.620 --> 05:22.087
Not 'duck'.
Ducking autocorrect."

05:22.156 --> 05:24.890
- Look at the number.
- No, I don't want to use

05:25.025 --> 05:26.891
One of keegan's contacts.
- Why not?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.493
- Is this lakyn girl
even carted?

05:28.495 --> 05:29.795
- No, but she's legit.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.963
Look, she gave keegan
tons of info the last few years.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.832
- So, why did he keep her
off the books?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.767
- I don't know. Maybe he wanted
to keep her intel to himself.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.570
- Ok. Ok...

05:38.639 --> 05:40.639
- Look, just call him, tell
him you're looking for coke.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.774
And please, do not say
it's one of your girls,

05:42.909 --> 05:46.912
'cause your pimp game is not...
You're just not the pimp type.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.048
- What are you talking about?
That works like all the time.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.316
- Hmmm... Does it, though?

05:52.353 --> 05:55.053
- Wha...
(sighing)

05:57.324 --> 05:58.723
Yo, cisco!

05:58.759 --> 06:00.592
Yo, it's your boy stu.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.862
Yeah, no, we met at the pole,
still...

06:03.864 --> 06:06.464
You know what I mean?
Yeah, greedy times.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.001
Listen, um...
My shorty, fay,

06:10.003 --> 06:12.804
Said that you're holding
some good soft.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.840
Nah, you know,
because the gal down there,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.408
They gotta be out there working.
Oh, no, you know what it is.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.613
Nah?

06:22.649 --> 06:24.616
- Nah!
- Why are you dissing now?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.952
Are you done?

06:26.954 --> 06:28.887
Well, if you don't
want my money,

06:29.022 --> 06:32.224
Then I'll find someone else,
obviously. Tsk!

06:32.226 --> 06:34.693
- What did I tell you?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.761
- Every second Tuesday,
here comes rick gray

06:36.764 --> 06:38.763
At that canadian casino.
He is carrying a bunch of chips.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.099
Miciano's leaving. He is
flush with cash. My theory:

06:42.136 --> 06:44.102
Rick gray paying
miciano in chips

06:44.171 --> 06:45.837
And miciano is
delivering drugs

06:45.972 --> 06:48.406
Buffalo to toronto
via the trade routes.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.443
Now what I'm thinking is we
shut down their pipeline! Yes!

06:51.578 --> 06:53.979
- Today is the second
Tuesday of the month.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.515
We've got to get on this.
- Yes!

06:56.517 --> 06:59.050
- (nazeer):<i> I used to be</i>
<i> so good at that.</i>

06:59.086 --> 07:01.186
I don't know what my problem is.
- Well, I do.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.555
It's because your wife
is leaving you.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.323
And let's be real,
I know it's a blow

07:05.359 --> 07:07.659
To the ole ego, but your wife
was kind of an asshole.

07:07.794 --> 07:11.329
You probably never should have
married her in the first place,

07:11.365 --> 07:13.064
But you clung on,
hoping things would change.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.933
I get it.

07:15.002 --> 07:18.135
- Great pep talk.
- But what you need to do

07:18.172 --> 07:21.673
Is get your mojo back, you know
what I'm saying? Get that swag.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.208
Hey, I got it.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.978
Set up a dating profile.
- No, I...

07:27.014 --> 07:28.814
I'm not ready for that.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.748
- Prr! Prr! Prr! Why not?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.951
(phone vibrating)

07:33.020 --> 07:34.953
Yo, if that's cisco,
I'll eat my arm.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.891
- Hello? Yo, cisco!

07:39.927 --> 07:42.827
What it is! What it do?

07:42.830 --> 07:45.029
(laughing)
1pm?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.965
You know, I got you.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.702
(laughing in disbelief)

07:50.771 --> 07:53.505
I may not sound like a pimp,
I get that,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.707
But I definitely don't sound
like a cop,

07:55.842 --> 07:57.308
So...
- Ok.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.245
- Do you want
to eat the arm now?

08:00.314 --> 08:03.782
Do you want to eat it later?
We'll save it for a snack.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.950
- Capital falls security
just called.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.387
- Yeah?
- Miciano is in the house!

08:09.389 --> 08:11.189
No sign of either
bowen brother, though.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.391
- What? No, wait,
is he meeting someone else?

08:13.393 --> 08:16.127
- Not unless you count the
juice bar attendant. Apparently

08:16.129 --> 08:17.862
He's been talking to her about
ayurveda for the last hour.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.797
- That seems very specific.
- Maybe that's why

08:19.867 --> 08:22.334
You still look so damn good.
- Ok, you know what?

08:22.469 --> 08:24.602
Let's just presume that
the money exchanged hands.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.638
We still need to figure out
where the drugs are coming from.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.341
So, I went through rick's phone
records; any calls he made

08:29.343 --> 08:32.143
To businesses or vendors
in buffalo that might be
crossing the border.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.212
- Anything coming
into toronto today?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.015
- Mm-hmm. A shipment, a7387,
it's mostly textiles.

08:37.017 --> 08:41.953
B9998 is electronics.
And x76544 is pistachios.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.689
- Ugh! The most annoying
of the nuts.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.657
- What?
- Well, they're so finicky!

08:46.693 --> 08:48.893
You know they have
to be refrigerated, right?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.095
It's so sad that the peanuts
are so maligned.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.898
I mean, that was a nut's nut!
That was a real man's nut!

08:53.934 --> 08:56.367
- Yeah, ok, could you just
not say that again?

08:56.436 --> 08:58.436
Wait... Say that again.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.605
- Man's--
- please, not about your nuts.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.841
About pistachios needing
to be refrigerated.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.610
- Yeah, you live under a rock?
- Ok! Oh my gosh!

09:05.679 --> 09:08.480
Refrigeration units,
they are the perfect compartment

09:08.482 --> 09:10.515
For concealing drugs.
What's the name of the company?

09:10.650 --> 09:12.984
- Um... Pizan's pistachios.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.986
- Ok, ok, ok, and when did
they last deliver to toronto?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.522
We have Tuesday the 4th.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.991
Oh, please, please, please...
Tuesday the 18th.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.661
- Every second Tuesday.
- Yes! Yes!

09:22.796 --> 09:25.196
- Here it comes...

09:25.265 --> 09:28.733
Oh no, you don't.
You do not mess with the master!

09:28.735 --> 09:30.868
- Yo. Visitor.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.837
- Thank you.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.474
Randy, hey.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.677
It's good to see you again.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.345
Tiggy.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.548
Tiggy sullivan.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.684
Rick's ex.
Remember rick?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.886
The guy in jail keeping his
mouth shut for being your plug?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.989
- Jesus, lady, watch it!

09:52.692 --> 09:54.725
There are four people who can
hear me on this thing.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.028
- I want to talk to you about
rick's role in your business.

09:57.064 --> 10:00.432
- Mmm. Well,

10:00.567 --> 10:03.368
Not much now, is it?
Poor old rick's in the clink.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.770
Oh, I see.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.506
This is shakedown, hmm?

10:10.710 --> 10:12.644
Women...

10:12.646 --> 10:16.381
Always wanting some.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.984
- I don't want your money, baby.
I want in.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.120
(snorting)
- yeah, ok.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.190
See, this is how this works,
right? First,

10:26.259 --> 10:30.227
You want to work for me.
Then you want to move in,

10:30.263 --> 10:31.997
And what do you know,
your kids are moving in--

10:32.132 --> 10:35.467
- I know you can't use
the nut run anymore.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.335
You need a fresh start.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.605
My trucks transport
all over north america.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.274
All kinds of goods.
All time of day.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.877
I'm completely unpredictable.
- Exactly.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.713
Women be crazy. Tig,
wrong time of the month,

10:48.715 --> 10:50.648
You'll shoot up
a negotiable situation.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.384
You're not an asset,
you're a liability.

10:53.387 --> 10:56.487
So I'll tell you what, why
don't you just take that money,

10:56.556 --> 10:59.557
Go get yourself some gel nails
and land yourself a new rick?

10:59.593 --> 11:01.559
Mm?
(voice screaming over speaker)

11:01.628 --> 11:04.295
What's that?
My squad awaits.

11:04.364 --> 11:08.566
Close the door on your way out.
(voice screaming over speaker)

11:18.478 --> 11:20.611
(indistinct conversation)

11:34.027 --> 11:37.395
- I can't do that much soft.
You got to talk to randy.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.431
Well, you got
something better to do?

11:39.566 --> 11:41.399
I got to go.
(thudding)

11:44.805 --> 11:47.205
Sorry about that.
Stu, right?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.873
- That's right.
(woman grunting)

11:49.008 --> 11:52.477
- Let me out, cisco!
- Somebody in there?

11:52.546 --> 11:55.346
- No, it's my ex-girlfriend.
Man, she's off her lid,

11:55.348 --> 11:57.014
You know how it is.
- (woman): Cisco, let me out!

11:57.050 --> 11:59.951
(grunting)
cisco!

11:59.953 --> 12:02.554
Get me out of here now!
You massive bitch!

12:02.556 --> 12:03.721
- Yo!

12:05.826 --> 12:08.426
Hey! Hey! What'd I say?
- You asshole!

12:08.428 --> 12:10.695
- Hey, guys, come on!
Take it easy, relax!

12:10.764 --> 12:13.430
What's the matter with you?
Take it easy!

12:13.467 --> 12:15.700
Come on, man, she's half your
size! What's wrong with you?

12:15.769 --> 12:17.235
- Get off me!

12:17.370 --> 12:20.004
- Ok, ok.
Take it easy, come on.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.009
(grunting)

12:25.011 --> 12:27.278
- (cisco): Lakyn!
- Duff?

12:27.280 --> 12:30.181
What are you doing here?
- Lakyn, get the--
- hey! No!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.118
You guys know each other?

12:35.222 --> 12:37.255
Are you a cop?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.657
(screaming)

12:39.793 --> 12:41.459
(engine starting)

12:46.266 --> 12:49.500
(tire screeching)

12:51.738 --> 12:53.571
(both panting)

12:55.909 --> 12:59.410
- The room is clean. He must
have had the coke on him.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.479
- What were you doing here?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.782
- Sorting things out
with my man.

13:03.917 --> 13:07.051
Did you hear him
call me his ex?

13:07.053 --> 13:10.488
What? I didn't know you were
gonna come here today.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.257
- You texted me this morning!

13:12.392 --> 13:15.093
- Yeah, I was in a bad place,
ok? But I got over it,

13:15.095 --> 13:17.294
And I lost my phone, so I
came here to tell him to get out

13:17.330 --> 13:20.932
And before I had the chance,
stewd showed up.
- It's stu.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.834
- The point is, he knows
I've been talking to the cops.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.570
So now you've got to get out
there and arrest him for real.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.106
- For what, huh? The invisible
drugs he didn't sell us?

13:29.176 --> 13:31.375
- There's got to be something,
'cause now he thinks I'm a rat!

13:32.946 --> 13:36.714
Cisco has people everywhere!

13:36.783 --> 13:39.617
They have guns.
Like a house full of guns.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.653
Have you ever been
to his place in north ridge?

13:46.827 --> 13:48.926
(sighing)
look, duff! Duff!

13:48.995 --> 13:51.228
If you're not gonna help me,
give me keegan's new number,

13:51.264 --> 13:53.131
He will.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.566
'cause if cisco finds me...

13:57.770 --> 14:00.605
I'm dead and you know it.

14:00.674 --> 14:04.275
(sighing)

14:14.254 --> 14:16.154
- What is it you people
do to your face

14:16.289 --> 14:18.222
When you start to look old?
- What do you mean,

14:18.225 --> 14:20.558
"you people?"
- women.

14:20.627 --> 14:24.061
- I don't know, like face cream?
- No, no, no, the toxic stuff.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.364
- Oh, botox.
- Yeah. Should I get that?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.565
- Huh, I don't know.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.701
I've never had it done before.
- Come on!

14:30.737 --> 14:33.037
You're a middle-class woman
in your 40s, you've had botox.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.540
- You know what, this is our
truck, plates match. Let's go.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.841
Let's go. Please,
let's move, let's move.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.911
- All right.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.650
- (driver): Can I help you?
- Gtpd, guns and gangs.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.185
We have a warrant here
to search your vehicle.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.788
- Can you open the back
for us, sir?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.392
- (sighing): Sure.

14:54.461 --> 14:58.195
- Aren't you worried that
we're gonna find your "pistash"

14:58.231 --> 15:00.598
In these pistachios?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.977
- Come on, wazowski,
where's the drugs?

15:14.848 --> 15:16.948
- It was a trial balloon.
- What for?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.883
- They wanted to see
if we were on to him

15:18.885 --> 15:21.218
After we arrested rick gray,
so they set us up.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.220
They did everything the same:
Same truck, same run, no drugs.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.623
It's very clever.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.992
- I guess it's safe to say that
stockwood's got a new route.

15:27.994 --> 15:31.229
- Yeah. We're gonna
have to start over.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.631
(kicks crate)

15:35.435 --> 15:37.702
- Come on, my mom's a cop.
- Yeah, all the more reason

15:37.771 --> 15:40.271
For you to get up here.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.440
She can get us out
of trouble if we have to.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.375
- Yeah...

15:44.377 --> 15:46.243
That's not how it works.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.179
She's, like, obsessed
with following the rules.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.114
You'll see when you meet her.
- Dude,

15:50.116 --> 15:53.584
I will never meet your mother.
I am from stockwood.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.919
She's never gonna
let you go out with me!

15:58.792 --> 16:00.491
(laughing): What?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.593
- You just said
we were going out.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.195
- No, I didn't.
- You did. I heard it.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.398
- Dude, I said
she wouldn't let you.

16:07.434 --> 16:11.335
- I mean, that means
you want to, though, so...

16:13.340 --> 16:15.206
- Maybe I do.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.109
- Yeah?

16:21.281 --> 16:24.482
- Maybe I do, maybe I do. What's
your mama gonna say about that?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.417
- Maybe she doesn't get a say.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.886
- ♪ you show me your love
and you take it away ♪

16:28.888 --> 16:31.889
(giggling)
where's your can?

16:33.927 --> 16:37.561
Hey, so, um... What am I
getting arrested for again?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.297
- Mischief.
Destruction of property.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.234
Possession of a...
Of a graffiti tool.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.271
- Ha!

16:48.674 --> 16:50.775
- Jelliot. Jelliot...

16:53.913 --> 16:56.246
- ♪ she's pretty as they come ♪

16:56.282 --> 16:58.449
♪ oh no ♪

17:04.857 --> 17:08.059
- Layna! I missed you, sister!

17:08.128 --> 17:10.661
- Oh!

17:10.730 --> 17:12.596
- I feel bad I made you
turn around.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.331
I know you wanted
to get down to miami.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.468
- What was the big emergency?
- This last minute work order

17:17.470 --> 17:20.171
For these bathroom fixtures.
Contractor couldn't wait.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.808
Paid well. Honestly,
if we were doing better,

17:23.943 --> 17:26.276
I'd hire another driver.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.946
Hell, I'd drive.
But I can't leave the kids.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.748
- I thought we were doing ok?
- We will be.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.318
'cause I got a plan.
(snorting)

17:34.320 --> 17:36.587
- Oh yeah? What's that?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.089
- We're gonna run drugs in from
buffalo to supply the bowens.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.760
- Are you mental?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.895
Didn't rick just
go to jail for that?

17:44.964 --> 17:47.231
- Yeah, which is why
there's an opening.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.100
He already connected me
to the buffalo guys.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.368
- No way! Ok?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.338
I'm not driving drugs
across the border!

17:54.407 --> 17:56.441
- Sissy face.
What's the big deal?

17:56.576 --> 17:59.843
You already did it.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.313
- Across the border with that?

18:02.448 --> 18:04.649
- Ken. He let you through
without checking, right?

18:04.784 --> 18:08.051
Buffalo pays him to look the
other way. It's called a route.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.857
- Come on, hold on! Calm down.
Buffalo is good with this.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.792
We just need to get
the bowens on board.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.861
- They don't know
about this yet?

18:16.863 --> 18:18.930
- I've done things a little
out of order, but it's fine.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.732
I'm on it!
- Jesus, tiggy.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.602
- The point is,
it's up to me now.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.274
We're in charge of the product,
we're in charge of everything.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.943
We get those assholes
to do things<i> our</i> way.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.079
No violence, no guns.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.882
We make money,
not problems.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.218
Once we're in the clear,
we get out of the game.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.432
- Hey, boss lady!

18:55.468 --> 18:59.270
- You're creeping. Creeping
means you want something.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.906
Does it have anything to do
with lakyn peffer?

19:01.908 --> 19:04.642
- Who told you about that?
- Mama got eyes in the
back of her head.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.044
- Yeah, ok, cool.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.113
So, I just need
to put her in a safe house.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.982
- Safe houses are for
carded informants only.

19:11.117 --> 19:14.118
- If I could card her now if
I could, but she's already been
exposed as a snitch.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.520
- Next time, look
before you leap. Anyway,

19:16.589 --> 19:18.989
Rope squad is already using it.
- Boss,

19:19.025 --> 19:21.992
She's either in there,
or she's hanging from a fence

19:22.028 --> 19:24.662
With cisco's initials carved
on her forehead. You want that?

19:24.731 --> 19:26.797
- What have I told you
about graphic descriptions

19:26.933 --> 19:29.800
Before I eat?
Speaking of which,

19:29.936 --> 19:31.669
Can you read this
extremely tiny,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.604
Extremely blurry lettering?
(sighing)

19:33.606 --> 19:36.874
- Yeah, just...

19:36.876 --> 19:38.742
Put it on high
for a minute.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.816
- Ok, you have exactly
one minute to convince me

19:45.818 --> 19:48.619
Why I need to protect somebody
that keegan was either too lazy

19:48.655 --> 19:51.389
Or too selfish to card.
- Ok, fine.

19:51.524 --> 19:55.226
Lakyn is a vulnerable,

19:55.361 --> 19:58.029
Cooperative member
of our community, and...

19:58.164 --> 20:01.232
And she's in trouble.
Look at this.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.702
She took this picture
at cisco's place.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.038
He's got a ton of weapons
in there, ok?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.907
I just need to keep her hidden
so I can bust them on the guns.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.709
- Except that's not
your department.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.178
If you want to bust them
on guns, go see guns and gangs.

20:14.313 --> 20:15.379
- Oh, please!

20:15.514 --> 20:19.250
Do not make me work
with her again.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.519
- Oh, I thought
this was about lakyn.

20:21.521 --> 20:25.256
Share the sandbox,
go see wazowski.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.791
Because we do not operate

20:27.860 --> 20:30.160
By keegan's playbook,
end of story.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.199
- For real, though?

20:35.334 --> 20:37.167
(sighing)

20:42.141 --> 20:46.677
Oh, look at you guys!

20:46.713 --> 20:49.747
I heard your pistachio play
went sideways.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.616
- I blame that nutcase
right there.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.818
- Well, the bright side is,

20:54.887 --> 20:57.287
I just got a tip about a pile
of guns at a stash house

20:57.323 --> 20:59.690
At 145, northridge.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.159
Tenant is a dealer named cisco.
- Cisco? Do you mean chad payne?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.362
- One and the same.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.431
Check this out.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.800
- Oh my god.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.370
- So, is this "pecan"
your curiosity?

21:13.506 --> 21:15.906
- Who owns the house?
- Some number company.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.942
- Ok, if we can confirm
there's guns inside,

21:17.944 --> 21:19.777
We need a warrant, and
that warrant is gonna give us

21:19.846 --> 21:21.712
All the info that we need.
- Exactly what I'm thinking.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.047
Great minds! So what do you say?
Want to go for a ride?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.983
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.719
She's got paperwork to do.
- Nothing you can't handle,

21:28.854 --> 21:30.221
Eh, barry?
- Ho-ho!

21:30.356 --> 21:34.725
Ho! Ha-ha! I guess
I'll "cashew" ladies later.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.827
- It's not bad, but keep on
working on those puns

21:36.863 --> 21:39.363
While we're gone, ok?
- All right, yeah.

21:39.365 --> 21:43.600
Yeah... I'll show you
I've got nothing but nuts.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.743
(suspenseful music)

22:02.288 --> 22:04.755
(overlapping voices)

22:04.791 --> 22:07.491
- Shh. Quiet, duff.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.364
What do you see?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.566
- Um...

22:15.635 --> 22:18.769
Ladies... Some gentlemen...

22:20.773 --> 22:23.107
Ah! Cisco.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.576
- Do you see drugs?
Do you see guns?

22:25.645 --> 22:28.479
- No, just a bunch of
idiots with ipads.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.382
And drugs...
I don't see- aah!

22:31.384 --> 22:33.250
(thudding)
- did you hear something?

22:33.286 --> 22:36.654
(dog barking)

22:36.789 --> 22:39.457
(guns clicking)

22:39.459 --> 22:41.959
- Yo, cisco fam.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.728
Must have been raccoons still.
Those things are everywhere.

22:44.764 --> 22:48.065
- Bam! Hunt that little bandit.
- Yeah, I hate those.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.968
All right, get inside.

22:54.674 --> 22:58.342
You took the entire bottle?
(door closes)

22:58.477 --> 23:00.677
(overlapping chatter)

23:06.185 --> 23:08.285
- (whispering): There's like
half of stockwood in there.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.621
- I told you!

23:10.690 --> 23:13.356
- Shh!
- Don't tell me to "shh!"

23:15.194 --> 23:17.161
Yes, sir,
I understand it's late.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.129
But judge novak,
this is really important.

23:19.132 --> 23:20.964
We have a suspect that
we are moments a--

23:21.033 --> 23:25.502
Ok. Um... I understand.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.438
I understand.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.906
Yes, we'll give you a call
first thing in the m--

23:29.942 --> 23:34.345
Morning. Good night.
No, it's past his bedtime.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.181
He's probably strapped into
his cpap for the night.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.517
Um...

23:39.652 --> 23:41.986
Speaking of which...

23:41.988 --> 23:44.455
Look, I hate to ask you this,
and it's pretty late,

23:44.524 --> 23:47.124
But do you mind if
I spend the night?
- Of course.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.727
Yes, oh my god. This is
gonna be- this could be fun.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.829
It will be fun.
It's a ladies night.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.965
♪ ladies night, ladies night ♪
- you're scary.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.800
- ♪ get in town
gonna get down ♪

23:56.836 --> 23:59.603
Guess what's in my fridge. I'm
gonna tell you what's in there.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.473
A melon that is begging to be
wrapped in some prosciutto.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.008
This is gonna be really...
You should have just...

24:05.044 --> 24:08.212
Don't even feel... Elliot, hi!
Just letting you know

24:08.281 --> 24:12.015
That mom has a guest over.
An overnight guest. Hello?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.685
- Yeah, I'm just watching
a movie and going to bed, ok?

24:14.820 --> 24:17.020
- Yeah, that's great.
Ok! Night, sweetie.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.356
- Who else is
down there with her?

24:19.425 --> 24:21.559
- That's got to be
another cop or something.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.961
She doesn't really have
friends like that, so...

24:24.096 --> 24:26.497
- Oh.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.702
(whispering): I've just got
to go to the washroom.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.838
- Yeah, go. She's not gonna
come up until she goes to bed.

24:34.907 --> 24:38.509
She's like a robot.
It's just down the hall.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.511
- Ok.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.652
- Well, it has been a long time
since I've had a sleepover!

24:48.787 --> 24:51.655
Now, listen, you might not
like meat-wrapped fruit,

24:51.691 --> 24:53.590
But how about some
vegetable-wrapped cheese?

24:53.626 --> 24:55.392
- So, when were you planning
on going to bed?

24:55.461 --> 24:57.461
- Do you want to play a game?
Remember this one?

24:57.530 --> 24:59.263
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.799
Light as a feather--
- you know, I hate to be rude,

25:01.934 --> 25:04.001
'cause this is your place,
but can you get off the couch?

25:04.070 --> 25:06.403
- Oh... Yeah.
I mean- yes.

25:06.439 --> 25:09.539
Because it's a big day tomorrow.
- Sure, yeah.

25:09.575 --> 25:12.376
- I think that once
we raid cisco's stash house,

25:12.511 --> 25:14.545
It's gonna lead us straight
to the bowens.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.882
- (sighing): Yeah.
We'll get cisco,

25:18.951 --> 25:21.885
Seize whatever he's got,
put a big hole in his op

25:21.954 --> 25:25.488
And save lakyn. And the rest
of them yahoos are going down.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.098
<i> It's gonna lead us straight</i>
<i> to the bowens.</i>

25:34.233 --> 25:36.299
- They're raiding
the bowen's stash house?

25:36.335 --> 25:38.635
Where? When?

25:38.671 --> 25:41.438
- Don't know. Jackie said
it's that dump on northridge.

25:41.507 --> 25:45.242
- I guess it's a good thing you
didn't partner with those guys.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.111
- Are you kidding me?
This is exactly what we needed

25:48.180 --> 25:51.047
To get them to partner with me.
We'll see if randy is so quick

25:51.083 --> 25:53.050
To turn me down now.
- God, I hate you.

25:53.052 --> 25:57.187
- (nazeer): This is...
Very interesting.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.123
- No, it's not.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.660
Can we go get
something to eat?

26:02.795 --> 26:05.596
- That's what doordash is for.
You stay here, you stay safe.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.364
- Well, I'm bored.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.400
And I don't see the point 'cause
this isn't even a safe house.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.269
- Only boring people get bored,
and yes, it is.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.873
- You're a bad liar.
That's a spanish guitar.

26:16.008 --> 26:19.342
Usually, these places are just
four walls and a crap couch.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.479
- Just don't touch anything.
And stop snooping.

26:22.548 --> 26:25.816
(playing guitar notes)
- you stop snooping.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.552
- I'm not snooping, I'm...

26:28.554 --> 26:30.454
I'm appreciating.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.426
- What's that? Oh!

26:35.561 --> 26:38.862
Duff's house. Knew it.
- It's just a picture of her.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.031
It's official police business.
- Did the official

26:41.067 --> 26:44.101
Police designer use to decorate
the official police safe house?

26:44.103 --> 26:47.237
No. That's the team
she and keegan coached.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.206
Mad skills basketball.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.508
I know because I gave keegan
the idea for the name.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.878
- What do you mean?

26:54.914 --> 26:58.582
- That's my son, milo.
He was on the team.

26:58.717 --> 27:01.785
- Oh, yeah? Where's milo now?

27:04.590 --> 27:07.157
(clicks tongue)
- can I use your phone?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.392
I just got to sort
something out.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.595
- You're not calling cisco.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.864
- He'll have
calmed down by now.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.499
I don't wanna fight
with him anymore.

27:15.501 --> 27:18.401
It will just take a sec.
I'll apologize for yelling and--

27:18.437 --> 27:21.405
- And what? Get locked
in a bathroom again?

27:21.474 --> 27:24.407
Or worse?
- You don't get it.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.211
Me and him are like
a roller coaster. It's good,

27:27.213 --> 27:30.146
It's bad, it's good...
But that's love.

27:30.182 --> 27:33.950
- You know,
I do get it, actually.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.219
When somebody is hurting you,

27:36.288 --> 27:39.089
You need to move on.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.759
- I don't want to.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.897
If I apologize,
he'll be cool.

27:46.966 --> 27:50.266
- Lakyn.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.372
He's not gonna be cool.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.519
- Ok! Yes, ok! Etf is ready,
we're on tech channel 5.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.588
Did you get the warrant?
- Yeah, about that,

28:11.590 --> 28:13.490
It seems that judge novak
is at his cottage.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.725
- Ooh, are you kidding me?
- No, am I not.

28:15.761 --> 28:18.395
I'm trying to get him
on video chat right now.

28:18.397 --> 28:21.732
- [hello?]
- judge novak, are you there?

28:21.734 --> 28:25.135
- I think his screen is frozen.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.470
- Or he's having a stroke.
- Shh. He can hear you.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.806
- [hello? Hello?]

28:29.842 --> 28:31.742
[hi, ladies.]

28:31.744 --> 28:33.911
[so, where are the detectives?]

28:34.046 --> 28:36.213
(laughing)

28:36.348 --> 28:38.282
I wasn't sure
if this was a meeting

28:38.417 --> 28:40.884
Or if you two were cam girls.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.820
[are you on mute?]

28:42.822 --> 28:45.355
Because that was supposed
to be a joke.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.491
- Ok, I'm a little curious
as to what he's talking about,

28:47.493 --> 28:49.226
Aren't you, detective?
- No, I am not, because we're

28:49.228 --> 28:51.428
On such a tight schedule.
We emailed you over a warrant.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.630
If we could just
get your sign-off.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.799
Ah, good to know you gals
have a sense of humour.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.902
[I don't want to get me-tooed
over workplace banter here.]

28:59.037 --> 29:01.772
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

29:01.907 --> 29:06.510
- How do I move this video chat
to get into my email?

29:06.645 --> 29:08.912
- Just... You minimize it.
- Just swipe.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.981
- No, no, no, minimize it.
- No, just swipe.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.717
Listen to what I'm saying.
- No, you have to minimize it.

29:13.852 --> 29:15.685
Oh, my! That's great!

29:15.755 --> 29:17.855
(laughing)

29:17.990 --> 29:21.324
- (kelly): Oh, that's a very
interesting perspective,

29:21.393 --> 29:23.459
Judge novak!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

29:25.131 --> 29:27.731
You throwing our entire gender
under the bus.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.732
- Are you kidding me right now?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.835
- I was playing a role.
Do you know what that's like?

29:31.970 --> 29:33.937
I think you would because
you're an undercover cop

29:33.973 --> 29:36.173
And you wear costumes all
the time. Every time I see you,

29:36.308 --> 29:37.774
You're somebody
different. What?

29:37.810 --> 29:41.144
- Whoa, do not
call them costumes ever.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.281
- Costumes.
- Watch your movement!

29:44.283 --> 29:46.550
- It's a funeral procession!
(honking)

29:46.552 --> 29:49.052
- I am so sorry!
- Can you move, please?

29:49.088 --> 29:51.088
- You have to stop!
- Why aren't they moving?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.023
- Maybe you can't drive
fast if you're sad!

29:53.025 --> 29:55.492
- That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard. Who says that?

29:55.627 --> 29:58.261
- I don't know. Speed
turns sadness into anger.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.965
- Oh my gosh.
We got us a poetess here.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.167
- Maybe we do.
- Snap-snap!

30:04.236 --> 30:06.970
A real feminist poetess here!
- That's right.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.472
- Well, maybe not
a feminist poetess.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.508
- I am a feminist poetess!

30:11.643 --> 30:14.378
I'm a feminist!

30:14.513 --> 30:16.246
- Really?
How did I not know that?

30:16.381 --> 30:18.182
- I don't know how.
- You care about women's rights,

30:18.317 --> 30:21.451
Me too, hashtag time's up?
- Yes, I do.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.320
- Right.
- Are you ever gonna let

30:23.389 --> 30:25.255
This judge thing go?
- No, I'm not.

30:25.390 --> 30:29.326
♪♪

30:34.466 --> 30:36.099
- (police officer): Hey.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.744
- The house is just
past this structure.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.892
- What?

31:01.894 --> 31:05.095
- You guys are sure
this is the place?

31:05.164 --> 31:07.997
- Where the hell
did the house go?

31:15.341 --> 31:17.240
- Mercedes, baby?
- Hey!

31:17.309 --> 31:20.377
- Wake up.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.681
What do you want?
- A "thank you"

31:24.750 --> 31:26.984
For moving your stash house
before the cops raided it,

31:27.119 --> 31:30.120
Like we discussed.
- Why did you move the
whole thing in the first place?

31:30.255 --> 31:32.589
- It's a mobile home.
- I know.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.958
- Plus you said it was filled
to the rafters with drugs

31:35.094 --> 31:37.127
And guns,
and questionable dna.

31:37.196 --> 31:40.197
- It is. I only said that
'cause I wanted you to clean it.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.132
(laughing)

31:42.267 --> 31:45.134
- Well, I didn't clean it.

31:45.170 --> 31:48.605
I moved it. And now
you don't know where it is.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.341
-<i> We pulled all the highway</i>
<i> closed-circuit tv footage</i>

31:51.410 --> 31:54.911
From the don valley,
as well as the qew.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.981
Nothing yet,
but on the bright side,

31:57.983 --> 32:00.150
We now know
who owns the house.

32:00.285 --> 32:03.353
Registered to a bowen arrow
holding company,

32:03.355 --> 32:05.088
Aka randy bowen.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.090
- They probably hauled it
away in a flatbed.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.558
There were 8 parallel
tire tracks.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.294
- How did they even know
that we were raiding it?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.362
You guys were there yesterday,

32:12.364 --> 32:15.299
The house wasn't going anywhere.
Somebody must have warned them.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.367
Where is your girl
lakyn right now?

32:17.502 --> 32:20.370
Obviously she likes to talk.
- I don't know.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.173
I'll find her.
I'll find her!

32:23.242 --> 32:25.308
But her tip was good.

32:25.311 --> 32:28.878
Whatever was in there
was worth carding away, huh?

32:28.914 --> 32:31.648
We'll find the house,
all right?

32:36.255 --> 32:40.023
What? She didn't tell cisco.
- How do you know?

32:40.092 --> 32:42.659
- Naz has been sitting on her
since we found her at the motel.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.228
- What? Where?
(sighing)

32:48.367 --> 32:49.932
(phone ringing)
- naz: [yeah?]

32:49.969 --> 32:52.001
- Hey. Let me talk to lakyn.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.204
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, but later,

32:54.339 --> 32:56.539
Can we talk about your...
Bath bombs?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.409
[I did not picture you
as a soaker.]

32:59.445 --> 33:02.678
Not that I was picturing you
in a tub or anything like that.

33:02.715 --> 33:04.748
- [ok, stop going
through my stuff.]

33:04.750 --> 33:07.884
- It was in plain view,
come on. Lakyn?

33:07.953 --> 33:10.353
Lakyn? Oh, no!

33:10.422 --> 33:13.289
- Naz, what?
Where is she?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.292
- [I was in the can
for 2 minutes, I don't know!]

33:15.294 --> 33:17.260
- I should have known
she'd pull one over on you!

33:17.262 --> 33:18.961
- What if cisco finds her?
- She's probably

33:18.998 --> 33:21.698
Looking for him!
She didn't have a phone,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.433
[so I don't know
how she would have...]

33:23.469 --> 33:25.468
- Did you unplug
the landline?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.172
- I'm sorry, landline?

33:29.307 --> 33:31.875
- Who has a landline anymore?
- I do. I have a landline.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.543
- Oh, I do. I also have
a landline. I mean,

33:33.612 --> 33:35.645
What if the power goes out?
What if the grid goes down?

33:35.647 --> 33:37.714
All these people trying to make
phone calls with their wrist

33:37.783 --> 33:39.782
Are gonna move at my house to
make a phone call

33:39.818 --> 33:41.785
With my good
old-fashioned ma bell.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.787
- [like cisco talking into his
headphones and all the tech.]

33:43.789 --> 33:46.389
- Wait a minute.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.659
That's it. That's<i> it.</i>

33:49.661 --> 33:51.794
His phone location is
turned off, but those headphones

33:51.830 --> 33:53.997
Have gps. We track those,
we find cisco

33:54.132 --> 33:57.934
And lakyn, and maybe
the stash house. Let's go!

33:58.070 --> 34:00.403
- Why do you think
this is a good idea?

34:00.439 --> 34:02.272
- 'cause I don't do
favours for free.

34:04.009 --> 34:07.410
We'll wipe everything down
before we leave.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.080
Disgusting!

34:10.215 --> 34:13.750
- I lost my virginity in here.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.752
What a dirt-bag!
- Oh! Lay!

34:15.821 --> 34:18.554
- Ha-ha-ha! Jackpot!

34:23.028 --> 34:25.829
Oh, my god!
- Leave the guns.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.231
- But they'll be
worth money.

34:28.366 --> 34:31.367
- I don't want them, all right?
I've got kids in the house.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.837
Plus, if the cops
do find this stash,

34:33.972 --> 34:36.305
It will get randy put away
for a good long while.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.274
(tires screeching)
get down!

34:39.978 --> 34:42.979
- (cisco): I told you,
we got paulie to follow tiggy!

34:43.015 --> 34:44.981
- Who the hell are
all these women?

34:45.050 --> 34:47.383
You don't get to keep lying
to me! Who is paulie and why--

34:47.385 --> 34:51.053
- Paulie! Paulie, my cousin!
He's helping us clear the house!

34:51.090 --> 34:53.056
- What, you think I'm stupid
or something, huh?

34:53.191 --> 34:55.658
I never should have called you.
- You want to call the cops?

34:55.694 --> 34:58.061
Yeah, why don't you call the
cops again and see what happens?

34:58.063 --> 34:59.996
- Yeah, maybe I will.
- Lakyn! Lakyn!

35:00.065 --> 35:02.933
- (kelly): Yes, someone
met cisco for the buy.

35:03.068 --> 35:06.269
He had a ton of gadgets on him.
Smartwatch, earbuds.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.671
I mean, the guy was like
half robot, half idiot.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.973
- Yeah, and entirely missing.
- And you want me to crack

35:11.009 --> 35:13.276
His find my app to find out
where his devices are at?

35:13.278 --> 35:15.278
- Well, I figured you techies
in fraud squad

35:15.280 --> 35:17.480
Have to be good
for something.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.550
- I can try to
figure out where he is.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.353
But how is that gonna
help you find his stash
house if he's not there?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.488
- Well, I saw
some ipads in there.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.824
Can you track those? I mean,
how many ipads do you need

35:27.893 --> 35:30.226
To leave the house with?
- Any criminal with half a brain

35:30.262 --> 35:31.995
Is gonna turn off his location,
so I don't know.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.364
- It's a good thing
he's a half idiot.

35:34.499 --> 35:39.135
- Ok. What's his date of birth?
- 10-22-91.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.441
- You smell so good!

35:44.576 --> 35:46.709
Amazing.
- I don't know

35:46.745 --> 35:49.179
Why I'm doing you this favour
when you haven't returned

35:49.314 --> 35:51.981
My text in two days.
- What are you talking about?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.984
I've been busy. Plus,
I'm not trying to get into

35:54.119 --> 35:56.119
This battle of communication
with you all the time.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.554
It's not what we're doing.
- There's nothing wrong

35:58.590 --> 36:00.323
With simple manners, kell.
- Can you keep your voice down?

36:00.325 --> 36:02.259
- (whispering): Well, I think
I left my charger at your place.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.327
I just wanted to know
if you'd seen it.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.596
- Oh my god! I just-

36:06.598 --> 36:08.932
I'm sorry, it's just that
this is right in front of me.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.600
Is this none of my business?

36:10.636 --> 36:12.469
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.671
- I do. Hi, I'm sam. Really nice
to meet you. You must be nana.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.307
(train whistling)

36:25.083 --> 36:26.749
- Thought you might get
some funny ideas

36:26.785 --> 36:28.985
After our last
little tit-a-tat.

36:29.054 --> 36:31.754
- It's tête-à-tête, dumbass.

36:31.790 --> 36:35.091
- You're the dumbass, tig,
thinking you can steal from us.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.694
Did you really think cisco
and I wouldn't find you?

36:37.829 --> 36:40.029
- We know people!
You're an idiot.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.840
- See? Who needs guns?

36:59.218 --> 37:02.719
- A few guns, no drugs.
- No cisco, no lakyn.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.654
- Why would they go through the
trouble of moving a whole house

37:04.789 --> 37:06.789
If there's barely
anything inside?

37:06.858 --> 37:08.992
- Maybe randy bowen
got here before we did

37:09.061 --> 37:11.794
And cleaned it out.
I found his wallet in a ditch.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.929
- Oh, great,
just what I always wanted:

37:13.966 --> 37:15.665
Randy bowen's
bonus rewards card.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.600
- You think you could
transfer them onto mine?

37:17.603 --> 37:19.669
Get something out of today...
- Yeah, get yourself

37:19.671 --> 37:22.172
Something frilly, wazowski!
- (cisco): Lakyn!

37:22.307 --> 37:24.874
Baby, I'm sorry!

37:26.578 --> 37:29.111
Lakyn, open the door!
(metal door clanking)

37:29.147 --> 37:31.914
Crazy bitch! Lakyn!

37:33.952 --> 37:36.619
- Police! Hands up!
- Come out nice and slow!

37:36.655 --> 37:38.621
Put your hands on your head!

37:38.624 --> 37:40.223
I said, put your hands
on your head!

37:43.729 --> 37:45.962
- I knew you were a cop.
- Where the hell is lakyn?

37:45.964 --> 37:48.365
- I don't know. That crazy bitch
chased me in there,

37:48.500 --> 37:50.600
She head-butted--
- I'm not a bitch!

37:50.602 --> 37:53.236
- Yeah, you are. You're a crazy
bitch. You can't even shoot me.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.972
That's a bitch move.
- Easy, easy! Hey, hey, hey!

37:55.974 --> 37:58.241
- Put it down, lakyn.
Lakyn, put it down.

37:58.243 --> 38:01.477
Put it down, lakyn.
- You're a crazy bitch.

38:01.513 --> 38:04.381
You're crazy, lakyn.
We're done.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.583
She did that to herself.
We're done.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.718
- Oh yeah, you're done.
That's the last time

38:08.853 --> 38:11.788
You ever touched me, asshole.
- It's all right, it's ok.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.524
(lakyn crying)
I got her.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.128
- (cisco): Yo, I dropped
my earbuds, man.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.729
Those things are expensive.

38:19.864 --> 38:22.332
- (sam): Yeah, they cost you
your freedom.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.205
Mmm!

38:29.207 --> 38:31.140
I did not realize
how hungry I was.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.409
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hmm!

38:40.152 --> 38:42.818
Hey, duff, um...

38:42.854 --> 38:45.755
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.491
- Water under the bridge.
- Yeah.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.961
You're the best.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.131
- You take care
of yourself, all right?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.233
Say "hi" to that kid
of yours for me.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.702
- Bye, stooge..

38:59.705 --> 39:01.304
- (kelly): Hey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

39:01.306 --> 39:03.072
- (keegan): Yeah.
- Bye.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.446
- Don't worry, I'm gonna
take her right up

39:10.515 --> 39:13.083
To her mother's front door.
- Yeah, before...

39:13.218 --> 39:15.251
Why didn't you card her?

39:15.253 --> 39:17.187
- Can't you see her?
She couldn't handle that.

39:17.322 --> 39:21.124
Any old cop just calling her up
and asking her for stuff?

39:21.126 --> 39:24.127
- So now I'm any old cop?
- Hey, don't put that on me.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.997
You shouldn't have used her.
(sighing)

39:28.033 --> 39:30.666
Look, I shouldn't have used
her either, all right?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.535
I'll call you later.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.138
I wanna hear all about today.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.040
How long have you and me been
trying to catch these guys for?

39:37.042 --> 39:39.875
- Oof... Feels like forever.
- Right?

39:41.679 --> 39:45.815
You, don't get too comfy
with this, you're just a temp.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.151
(laughing)

39:48.220 --> 39:50.286
Get off my car!

39:50.355 --> 39:52.221
(kelly sighing)

39:54.393 --> 39:57.827
- You ok?
- Me? I'm fine.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.597
You're the one who was
going through my drawers

40:01.633 --> 40:04.333
And wallowing in self-pity.

40:04.403 --> 40:07.437
- Well, I took your advice.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.439
Got on this dating app
over here

40:10.475 --> 40:12.908
And, uh...
It's not going well.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.911
I'm just gonna close my eyes
and keep swiping right.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.646
I don't know,
is that how it works or...?

40:16.715 --> 40:19.115
- Nuh-uh.
Keep your eyes open.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.851
- Something's been bothering me.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.720
If lakyn didn't tell cisco

40:23.855 --> 40:27.524
Or randy that we were coming
for their stash, who did?

40:29.428 --> 40:31.861
- Your guess is
as good as mine.

40:40.105 --> 40:43.940
- (sighing): He's still out.
- Oh my god.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.275
Oh my god.

40:46.344 --> 40:48.411
Oh my god, did I kill him?
I think I killed him.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.414
- Calm down. Would you quit
flapping your gums for a minute

40:51.549 --> 40:55.685
So I can think, ok?
Ok, it was him or us.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.953
We didn't have a choice.
- Yeah.

40:57.989 --> 41:01.557
Do we untie him or--
- what? No!

41:01.626 --> 41:04.160
- We can't just keep him
tied up forever.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.764
What are we gonna do
with him, tig?

41:11.102 --> 41:13.970
- Whatever we have to.
