00:05.670 --> 00:07.000
<b>Now, for verification...</b>

00:07.000 --> 00:09.360
<b>Are you Pakunoda, from the Troupe?</b>

00:09.720 --> 00:10.610
<b>Of course.</b>

00:11.520 --> 00:12.710
<b>She's telling the truth.</b>

00:14.580 --> 00:19.210
<b>I will present each of you with two conditions.</b>

00:19.210 --> 00:22.150
<b>If you abide by them, 
I will release your leader.</b>

00:27.370 --> 00:28.970
<b><i>Pay attention, Pakunoda.</i></b>

00:30.070 --> 00:35.010
<b><i>He's more concerned about his friends 
than killing me for his vengeance.</i></b>

00:36.630 --> 00:38.730
<b><i>That is the chain user's weakness!</i></b>

01:59.010 --> 02:04.060
<b>Signal x To x Retreat</b>

02:05.670 --> 02:08.260
<b>I'll begin with the leader.</b>

02:08.260 --> 02:12.460
<b>First, you are forbidden to use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:13.150 --> 02:14.070
<b>Second...</b>

02:21.310 --> 02:23.060
<b><i>Am I certain about this?</i></b>

02:24.210 --> 02:28.030
<b><i>If I eliminate the boss, 
the spider will fall apart.</i></b>

02:28.030 --> 02:29.460
<b><i>That was the whole idea.</i></b>

02:29.460 --> 02:30.420
<b><i>But...</i></b>

02:31.040 --> 02:33.670
<b><i>I have no value as a hostage.</i></b>

02:34.330 --> 02:36.770
<b><i>Everything he says is true.</i></b>

02:37.870 --> 02:40.750
<b><i>But the spider can move, 
even without a head.</i></b>

02:41.980 --> 02:44.260
<b><i>The leader isn't absolute...</i></b>

02:44.880 --> 02:48.270
<b><i>If necessary, the group is 
willing to abandon its leader.</i></b>

02:48.860 --> 02:51.190
<b><i>That is the nature of the Phantom Troupe.</i></b>

02:51.840 --> 02:56.190
<b><i>I can disable their leader, 
but that won't cripple the Troupe!</i></b>

02:57.780 --> 03:00.160
<b><i>However, is there any alternative?</i></b>

03:00.650 --> 03:03.290
<b><i>Is there some kind of miracle</i></b>

03:03.290 --> 03:05.200
<b><i>that can get me out of this bind?!</i></b>

03:07.910 --> 03:08.800
<b><i>There isn't.</i></b>

03:09.480 --> 03:10.690
<b><i>I can think of nothing...</i></b>

03:11.300 --> 03:13.380
<b><i>Yes, this is right.</i></b>

03:14.980 --> 03:17.270
<b><i>Right now, this is what I should do.</i></b>

03:19.700 --> 03:21.670
<b><i>I must get them back.</i></b>

03:21.670 --> 03:23.310
<b><i>That is my top priority!</i></b>

03:26.330 --> 03:29.670
<b><i>I don't want to lose</i></b>

03:29.670 --> 03:31.200
<b><i>any more friends!</i></b>

03:32.210 --> 03:36.590
<b>Second, you may not contact 
any member of the Troupe.</b>

03:37.020 --> 03:39.070
<b>Those are the two conditions.</b>

03:39.070 --> 03:41.740
<b>And to make certain that you adhere to them,</b>

03:41.740 --> 03:46.040
<b>I will use my Judgment Chain, 
the Arbiter Little Finger, on your leader.</b>

03:46.970 --> 03:51.290
<b>You decide if this is acceptable, Pakunoda.</b>

03:57.880 --> 03:59.160
<b>Okay.</b>

04:12.650 --> 04:14.520
<b>You're next, Pakunoda.</b>

04:16.540 --> 04:17.790
<b>First,</b>

04:17.790 --> 04:23.300
<b>release Gon and Killua unharmed, 
before midnight, without any tricks.</b>

04:23.300 --> 04:28.030
<b>Second, you may not speak 
a single word about me.</b>

04:28.630 --> 04:31.330
<b>If you have no objections, 
I will use my chain on you.</b>

04:31.870 --> 04:32.980
<b>Okay.</b>

04:39.210 --> 04:43.300
<b>If Gon and Killua were being 
controlled by a Manipulator,</b>

04:43.800 --> 04:46.030
<b>could you tell from their heartbeats?</b>

04:46.030 --> 04:47.300
<b>It's certainly possible.</b>

04:47.300 --> 04:51.360
<b>I've met Killua-kun, and I know how 
his normal heartbeat sounds.</b>

04:51.360 --> 04:54.410
<b>So I could tell if anything had changed.</b>

04:54.410 --> 04:55.680
<b>That's good enough.</b>

04:56.800 --> 04:59.680
<b>I have something to say before the exchange.</b>

05:02.580 --> 05:03.820
<b><i>Kurapika...</i></b>

05:04.820 --> 05:08.250
<b><i>In the back of your mind, 
you sense that something is amiss.</i></b>

05:09.330 --> 05:13.080
<b><i>Why did she come alone?</i></b>

05:14.070 --> 05:17.440
<b><i>If the Troupe were as merciless as expected,</i></b>

05:17.440 --> 05:20.590
<b><i>this deal would be impossible.</i></b>

05:21.170 --> 05:23.960
<b><i>You people are the ones on the ropes.</i></b>

05:24.550 --> 05:26.720
<b><i>Their rules are ironclad,</i></b>

05:26.720 --> 05:29.720
<b><i>and their boss accepts them.</i></b>

05:30.830 --> 05:32.580
<b><i>But what about the others?</i></b>

05:32.580 --> 05:35.230
<b><i>This woman appears to be different.</i></b>

05:35.990 --> 05:40.980
<b><i>This woman you despise 
with everything you have</i></b>

05:42.130 --> 05:45.580
<b><i>is driven by the same motive that drives you.</i></b>

05:47.550 --> 05:49.240
<b><i>She wishes</i></b>

05:49.730 --> 05:52.310
<b><i>to save her companion, her boss.</i></b>

05:53.580 --> 05:57.010
<b><i>You must have realized this.</i></b>

05:59.050 --> 06:02.220
<b>Start by returning to your companions.</b>

06:02.220 --> 06:04.240
<b>Inform them of the hostage exchange.</b>

06:04.240 --> 06:08.570
<b>I want you to bring the hostages to 
Lingon Airport before midnight.</b>

06:08.570 --> 06:10.200
<b>Bring no one else.</b>

06:10.200 --> 06:11.860
<b>Tell no one where you're going.</b>

06:12.350 --> 06:13.450
<b>Very well.</b>

06:13.840 --> 06:15.390
<b>You have a deal.</b>

06:16.300 --> 06:18.270
<b>Take me back to the airport.</b>

06:20.770 --> 06:23.020
<b>Why haven't you asked any questions?</b>

06:24.460 --> 06:26.940
<b>You know who I am, don't you?</b>

06:27.530 --> 06:28.530
<b>You aren't worried?</b>

06:29.060 --> 06:31.440
<b>You don't find this deal unreasonable?</b>

06:31.950 --> 06:35.040
<b>Do you truly believe I'll return your leader?</b>

06:35.730 --> 06:36.540
<b>Yes.</b>

06:37.970 --> 06:40.460
<b>You wouldn't ask those questions</b>

06:40.460 --> 06:42.900
<b>if you intended to deceive me.</b>

06:50.880 --> 06:54.050
<b>Does he really expect us to 
accept those conditions?</b>

06:56.430 --> 06:58.350
<b>Tell us where he is, Pakunoda.</b>

06:58.350 --> 07:01.690
<b>We'll kill the kids, then deal 
with the chain user.</b>

07:02.040 --> 07:03.190
<b>You're insisting?</b>

07:03.190 --> 07:04.660
<b>I insist.</b>

07:04.660 --> 07:07.190
<b>If you don't tell us, I won't let you leave.</b>

07:07.500 --> 07:12.070
<b>I refuse to tell you where he is, 
and I am taking the kids alone.</b>

07:12.510 --> 07:13.820
<b>Don't interfere.</b>

07:14.140 --> 07:15.010
<b>Interfere?</b>

07:15.010 --> 07:17.330
<b>Who's the one interfering with <i>our</i> plans?!</b>

07:17.700 --> 07:19.330
<b>Go, Pakunoda.</b>

07:19.330 --> 07:21.080
<b>We'll stop them.</b>

07:21.080 --> 07:22.200
<b>Stop us?</b>

07:22.680 --> 07:24.080
<b>Are you trying to insult us?</b>

07:25.550 --> 07:26.810
<b>You're serious?</b>

07:26.810 --> 07:28.790
<b>I don't get it.</b>

07:28.790 --> 07:31.340
<b>Have you lost your minds?</b>

07:31.340 --> 07:36.330
<b>I bet they were defeated by the 
chain user before we arrived.</b>

07:36.330 --> 07:37.970
<b>They're probably under his control.</b>

07:38.560 --> 07:39.980
<b>This is a waste of time.</b>

07:39.980 --> 07:41.600
<b>I'll make them talk.</b>

07:42.170 --> 07:43.600
<b>Is it really so hard to understand?</b>

07:46.550 --> 07:50.620
<b>You don't understand why Pakunoda 
wants to leave without a word?</b>

07:51.280 --> 07:54.270
<b>You don't understand why 
Machi is stopping you?</b>

07:54.740 --> 07:57.540
<b>You honestly think they're being controlled?</b>

07:58.290 --> 08:01.650
<b>They want to rescue your boss!</b>

08:01.650 --> 08:05.330
<b>Is it so hard to understand 
the desire to save a friend?</b>

08:05.330 --> 08:06.870
<b>Shut up, kid!</b>

08:06.870 --> 08:08.500
<b>Are you that desperate to be spared?</b>

08:11.520 --> 08:13.540
<b>I'm not doing this for my sake.</b>

08:14.100 --> 08:15.140
<b>Take back those words!</b>

08:17.160 --> 08:18.280
<b>Good grief.</b>

08:20.080 --> 08:23.010
<b>I refuse. 
If you've a problem, come here.</b>

08:23.010 --> 08:25.900
<b>The second you take a step, 
I'll rip your head off.</b>

08:26.290 --> 08:28.900
<b>Then I won't budge an inch!</b>

08:29.360 --> 08:31.400
<b>Kurapika isn't like you.</b>

08:31.720 --> 08:33.990
<b>No matter how much he hates someone,</b>

08:33.990 --> 08:37.330
<b>he wouldn't lose control and 
kill them without mercy.</b>

08:37.330 --> 08:40.090
<b>If he makes a promise,</b>

08:40.090 --> 08:42.970
<b>he will definitely keep his word!</b>

08:42.970 --> 08:46.420
<b>After meeting him in person, 
Pakunoda knows this.</b>

08:46.720 --> 08:50.150
<b>If you follow his conditions, 
he'll return your boss!</b>

08:50.150 --> 08:52.220
<b>That's enough, kid...</b>

08:52.220 --> 08:54.620
<b>Don't think you can say anything you want!</b>

08:54.620 --> 08:55.810
<b>That's enough.</b>

08:56.890 --> 08:58.800
<b>Let Pakunoda go.</b>

08:59.260 --> 09:01.180
<b>You're siding with them?</b>

09:01.620 --> 09:02.430
<b>Shal,</b>

09:02.870 --> 09:06.530
<b>right now, what would our 
worst-case scenario be?</b>

09:07.490 --> 09:09.660
<b>The boss is already dead,</b>

09:09.660 --> 09:11.970
<b>Pakunoda and the others are being controlled,</b>

09:11.970 --> 09:14.570
<b>we can't find the chain user,</b>

09:14.920 --> 09:17.780
<b>and the two kids escape...</b>

09:18.200 --> 09:20.030
<b>Then, you've got it wrong.</b>

09:20.560 --> 09:24.720
<b>The worst-case scenario would be that 
we all die and the spider perishes.</b>

09:24.720 --> 09:28.450
<b>By comparison, your scenario 
would be quite pleasant.</b>

09:28.870 --> 09:30.010
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

09:30.500 --> 09:32.670
<b>N-No, you're right.</b>

09:32.670 --> 09:34.610
<b>I don't care about your reasons.</b>

09:34.610 --> 09:37.500
<b>You're being too reliant on the boss.</b>

09:37.500 --> 09:40.540
<b>If the Troupe falls apart as a result,</b>

09:40.540 --> 09:43.930
<b>that's the greatest betrayal you 
could make toward the boss.</b>

09:44.440 --> 09:47.360
<b>If we keep bickering, that could well happen.</b>

09:47.360 --> 09:48.490
<b>Cool off.</b>

09:49.070 --> 09:50.690
<b>Let them have their way...</b>

09:51.300 --> 09:53.320
<b>Pakunoda can take the kids.</b>

09:53.320 --> 09:55.870
<b>If the boss doesn't return,</b>

09:55.870 --> 09:59.960
<b>we kill the members being controlled, 
and start to rebuild the spider.</b>

09:59.960 --> 10:01.890
<b>It's extremely simple.</b>

10:01.890 --> 10:03.050
<b>I'm fine with that.</b>

10:03.050 --> 10:04.920
<b>If that's what it takes to satisfy you.</b>

10:04.920 --> 10:09.250
<b>Well, I'm not being controlled, 
and it won't be easy to kill me.</b>

10:13.220 --> 10:13.920
<b>Hello?</b>

10:13.920 --> 10:15.710
<b>Put the hostages on the phone.</b>

10:16.590 --> 10:17.590
<b>Don't break it!</b>

10:18.220 --> 10:19.220
<b>Are you okay?</b>

10:19.220 --> 10:20.400
<b>Are they there?</b>

10:20.400 --> 10:22.350
<b>Yeah, they're all here.</b>

10:23.140 --> 10:23.850
<b>Hey!</b>

10:26.220 --> 10:27.850
<b>We're following your orders.</b>

10:31.000 --> 10:32.900
<b>Aren't you going to follow them?</b>

10:32.900 --> 10:37.430
<b>The chain user can't monitor our location now.</b>

10:38.300 --> 10:39.490
<b>Shut up.</b>

10:39.490 --> 10:42.230
<b>If I give chase, you'll all stop me.</b>

10:43.060 --> 10:45.120
<b>For now, I'll just sit and wait.</b>

10:45.480 --> 10:50.110
<b>If the boss fails to return, I'll kill you, too.</b>

10:50.110 --> 10:51.750
<b>Go ahead.</b>

10:53.840 --> 10:55.590
<b>Board the waiting airship.</b>

10:56.090 --> 10:57.830
<b>The pilot already has his orders.</b>

10:59.120 --> 11:01.170
<b>As promised, it's just the three of them.</b>

11:01.600 --> 11:03.260
<b>We can't be sure until the airship takes off.</b>

11:03.750 --> 11:05.530
<b>Stay alert.</b>

11:05.530 --> 11:06.890
<b>There's someone over there.</b>

11:11.150 --> 11:12.060
<b>That's</b>

11:12.640 --> 11:13.690
<b>Hisoka!</b>

11:13.940 --> 11:14.670
<b>Hi...</b>

11:15.690 --> 11:17.190
<b>Why are you here?!</b>

11:17.630 --> 11:19.270
<b>Did you sneak out?</b>

11:19.270 --> 11:20.920
<b>No need for concern...</b>

11:20.920 --> 11:22.950
<b>I left a dummy behind.</b>

11:23.340 --> 11:25.100
<b><i>Hurry up.</i></b>

11:25.100 --> 11:28.950
<b><i>Without needles, I can only change 
my face for four to five hours.</i></b>

11:29.370 --> 11:30.990
<b>What are you up to?</b>

11:30.990 --> 11:33.310
<b>Allow me on the airship with them.</b>

11:33.310 --> 11:36.620
<b>If you refuse, I'll kill Gon and Killua.</b>

11:37.090 --> 11:38.460
<b>Bastard...</b>

11:38.460 --> 11:40.100
<b><i>Just kidding.</i></b>

11:40.100 --> 11:42.540
<b><i>That would be such a waste.</i></b>

11:43.320 --> 11:46.160
<b>My target is the boss.</b>

11:46.160 --> 11:49.330
<b>Once he's released, I'll get off the airship.</b>

11:50.050 --> 11:51.980
<b>I want to fight him.</b>

11:52.860 --> 11:54.420
<b>That's all I want.</b>

12:12.460 --> 12:15.000
<b>Killua, place the phone next to your heart.</b>

12:17.930 --> 12:20.570
<b>It's fine, nothing's wrong with him.</b>

12:20.570 --> 12:23.010
<b>Okay, let's begin the exchange!</b>

12:44.090 --> 12:47.530
<b><i>If you talk to or make any contact 
with a Troupe member, you die.</i></b>

12:48.470 --> 12:51.920
<b><i>Now you will get to experience the pain</i></b>

12:51.920 --> 12:53.540
<b><i>of losing your home.</i></b>

12:58.660 --> 13:01.550
<b>I've waited a long time for this moment.</b>

13:03.470 --> 13:04.780
<b>Now...</b>

13:04.780 --> 13:06.190
<b>Let's do this.</b>

13:12.580 --> 13:15.140
<b>I no longer need this.</b>

13:18.950 --> 13:21.390
<b>This won't be considered an internal spat now,</b>

13:21.390 --> 13:23.130
<b>so you needn't hold back.</b>

13:29.360 --> 13:30.400
<b>I see.</b>

13:30.400 --> 13:32.410
<b>You aren't a Troupe member, 
so we can talk.</b>

13:33.370 --> 13:35.370
<b>I can't fight you.</b>

13:35.370 --> 13:38.920
<b>Rather, I'm not worth fighting.</b>

13:39.550 --> 13:43.930
<b>He used his Judgment Chain on my heart.</b>

13:44.460 --> 13:47.160
<b>I can no longer use my <i>Nen</i>.</b>

13:53.570 --> 13:55.350
<b>We can leave.</b>

13:55.350 --> 13:56.310
<b>Oh...</b>

13:57.220 --> 14:00.810
<b>Hisoka returned to the airship without fighting.</b>

14:01.240 --> 14:04.520
<b>The leader realized that Hisoka 
wasn't a Troupe member,</b>

14:04.520 --> 14:06.320
<b>so he explained about my chains.</b>

14:06.880 --> 14:10.320
<b>I'm not surprised that Hisoka wasn't interested</b>

14:10.320 --> 14:12.830
<b>in fighting someone without <i>Nen</i>.</b>

14:12.830 --> 14:15.010
<b>He wasn't a Troupe member?</b>

14:15.010 --> 14:15.830
<b>No.</b>

14:16.710 --> 14:18.460
<b>How did you sneak out?</b>

14:18.880 --> 14:21.580
<b>I have a friend who's good with disguises.</b>

14:21.580 --> 14:23.210
<b>Don't worry.</b>

14:23.210 --> 14:26.840
<b>I no longer have any reason to kill Chrollo.</b>

14:28.070 --> 14:30.550
<b>I'm not interested in broken toys.</b>

14:31.800 --> 14:33.850
<b>"You can slip out now..." There.</b>

14:34.760 --> 14:35.960
<b>That's right.</b>

14:35.960 --> 14:38.350
<b>My real fortune mentioned</b>

14:38.350 --> 14:41.320
<b>I would have a date with the boss on Tuesday.</b>

14:41.320 --> 14:43.890
<b>And when I left,</b>

14:43.890 --> 14:46.490
<b>the Troupe was supposed to be 
down to half its members.</b>

14:47.800 --> 14:51.320
<b>Fate appears to be changing, bit by bit.</b>

14:52.470 --> 14:54.740
<b>I'm sorry for putting you in danger.</b>

14:55.230 --> 14:56.290
<b>Nah...</b>

14:56.290 --> 14:58.410
<b>You used your chains on the boss, right?</b>

14:58.410 --> 15:00.000
<b>Yeah, but...</b>

15:00.540 --> 15:03.030
<b>This isn't the end.</b>

15:16.910 --> 15:18.020
<b>Meow.</b>

15:20.300 --> 15:21.860
<b>Where's the boss?</b>

15:21.860 --> 15:23.380
<b>He won't be coming here.</b>

15:23.380 --> 15:26.530
<b>Don't mess with me. 
Explain yourself!</b>

15:27.170 --> 15:28.510
<b>Depending on your response...</b>

15:29.460 --> 15:30.560
<b>Don't worry.</b>

15:31.930 --> 15:33.280
<b>In return...</b>

15:35.820 --> 15:38.230
<b><i>I can only shoot six bullets at once.</i></b>

15:38.840 --> 15:41.090
<b><i>That's enough for the 
remaining founding members.</i></b>

15:42.080 --> 15:43.040
<b>Feitan.</b>

15:43.340 --> 15:44.290
<b>Phinks.</b>

15:44.570 --> 15:45.290
<b>Machi.</b>

15:45.290 --> 15:46.300
<b>Nobunaga.</b>

15:46.620 --> 15:47.550
<b>Shalnark.</b>

15:47.980 --> 15:48.800
<b>Franklin.</b>

15:53.020 --> 15:56.060
<b>Do you trust me?</b>

15:59.520 --> 16:01.310
<b><i>Paku, you can't mean to...</i></b>

16:01.720 --> 16:04.170
<b>Hey, are you being controlled by—</b>

16:04.170 --> 16:04.810
<b>Phinks!</b>

16:06.110 --> 16:07.390
<b>Have some faith.</b>

16:07.930 --> 16:08.940
<b>It's Paku.</b>

16:11.050 --> 16:12.450
<b><i>My memories...</i></b>

16:14.300 --> 16:16.160
<b><i>My feelings...</i></b>

16:19.240 --> 16:20.580
<b><i>I pass them all to you.</i></b>

16:31.750 --> 16:32.930
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

16:34.400 --> 16:35.750
<b><i>Let all this</i></b>

16:36.580 --> 16:37.720
<b><i>end with me...</i></b>

16:38.150 --> 16:38.840
<b>Paku.</b>

16:47.430 --> 16:48.530
<b>She's dead.</b>

16:50.040 --> 16:51.300
<b>What's going on?</b>

16:51.860 --> 16:53.490
<b>Let me explain.</b>

16:56.280 --> 16:57.890
<b>I understand everything.</b>

16:59.570 --> 17:00.700
<b>Pakunoda was...</b>

17:08.040 --> 17:11.770
<b>I hope Kurapika's fever doesn't break.</b>

17:11.770 --> 17:13.370
<b>Yeah...</b>

17:13.370 --> 17:15.820
<b>Wait, did you just say what I think you said?</b>

17:15.820 --> 17:19.500
<b>Kurapika shouldn't fight the Troupe anymore.</b>

17:21.000 --> 17:24.440
<b>I thought of something when Kurapika 
told me about his powers.</b>

17:25.240 --> 17:27.910
<b>If he'd just wanted revenge,</b>

17:27.910 --> 17:31.250
<b>he would have chosen different abilities.</b>

17:31.250 --> 17:32.190
<b>Really?</b>

17:32.540 --> 17:35.690
<b>If he'd only wanted to kill them,</b>

17:35.690 --> 17:39.580
<b>he wouldn't have gone to the 
trouble of chaining their hearts.</b>

17:39.580 --> 17:41.950
<b>Maybe if he only had one target.</b>

17:42.970 --> 17:45.750
<b>But Kurapika's dealing with the entire Troupe.</b>

17:45.750 --> 17:48.010
<b>Even if he captures one, 
he can't kill them right away.</b>

17:48.910 --> 17:51.670
<b>And he needs to extract information 
about the other members.</b>

17:52.320 --> 17:53.730
<b>Oh...</b>

17:53.730 --> 17:55.130
<b>Personally,</b>

17:55.130 --> 17:58.050
<b>I think his powers were meant 
specifically for revenge.</b>

17:58.600 --> 17:59.900
<b>Oh...</b>

18:00.790 --> 18:03.400
<b><i>But that was his original objective.</i></b>

18:03.400 --> 18:05.280
<b><i>Kurapika is different now.</i></b>

18:06.820 --> 18:10.360
<b><i>I have good friends...</i></b>

18:13.760 --> 18:15.630
<b>But you do have a point.</b>

18:15.630 --> 18:18.050
<b>I'd prefer him to stay still for a while.</b>

18:18.520 --> 18:20.370
<b>If their boss doesn't come back,</b>

18:20.370 --> 18:23.390
<b>they'll be even more 
determined to find Kurapika.</b>

18:23.390 --> 18:24.540
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:24.540 --> 18:26.970
<b>We'll have to be extremely careful</b>

18:26.970 --> 18:29.170
<b>when we go to the auction house.</b>

18:29.420 --> 18:34.080
<b>So, do you really have a plan for 
obtaining a copy of <i>Greed Island</i> ?</b>

18:34.080 --> 18:36.200
<b>Your plan is all we have to go on!</b>

18:36.200 --> 18:39.330
<b>Y-Yeah, but it's a fifty-fifty deal.</b>

18:39.330 --> 18:42.180
<b>Originally, didn't you say it had 
a seventy percent chance?</b>

18:43.070 --> 18:45.680
<b>I get it... That's clever.</b>

18:45.990 --> 18:48.800
<b>Actually, that may be our only shot.</b>

18:49.100 --> 18:51.170
<b>Realistic and sound.</b>

18:52.350 --> 18:55.050
<b>I think it has an eighty percent chance!</b>

18:55.050 --> 18:55.690
<b>Really?</b>

18:55.690 --> 18:57.070
<b>Yeah, we can make it work!</b>

19:00.200 --> 19:02.570
<b>The auction is in Hall B.</b>

19:03.050 --> 19:04.450
<b>That way. Over there.</b>

19:06.510 --> 19:08.060
<b>Wow!</b>

19:10.900 --> 19:11.920
<b>Huh?</b>

19:15.830 --> 19:17.700
<b>Why are they here?</b>

19:17.700 --> 19:18.720
<b>How would I know?!</b>

19:20.410 --> 19:22.030
<b>Hey, that was cold.</b>

19:22.030 --> 19:23.470
<b>No need to run away.</b>

19:23.780 --> 19:25.390
<b><i>Why wouldn't we run away?</i></b>

19:25.390 --> 19:26.860
<b>Don't worry.</b>

19:26.860 --> 19:29.410
<b>We're not going to kill you.</b>

19:29.410 --> 19:33.440
<b>Because we can't kill the chain user now.</b>

19:33.440 --> 19:35.020
<b>Huh? What do you mean?</b>

19:35.320 --> 19:36.310
<b>Huh?</b>

19:36.310 --> 19:38.890
<b>Didn't he use his chains on the boss?</b>

19:38.890 --> 19:40.990
<b>That means we can't kill him.</b>

19:40.990 --> 19:42.020
<b>Why not?</b>

19:42.020 --> 19:43.030
<b>Isn't it the other way around?</b>

19:43.490 --> 19:48.140
<b><i>It's pretty useful to have someone 
who's willing to ask questions.</i></b>

19:48.140 --> 19:51.540
<b><i>Nen</i> doesn't necessarily disappear after death.</b>

19:52.440 --> 19:57.010
<b><i>Nen</i> that's driven by hatred and regret 
can persist a long time after death.</b>

19:57.590 --> 20:01.550
<b>That <i>Nen</i> will direct itself toward 
the target of those emotions.</b>

20:02.080 --> 20:04.860
<b>Since the boss can no longer use <i>Nen</i>,</b>

20:04.860 --> 20:09.060
<b>he could be overwhelmed by that assault.</b>

20:09.440 --> 20:11.690
<b>Residual <i>Nen</i> can be quite fearsome.</b>

20:12.270 --> 20:14.440
<b>That's why we can't kill the chain user.</b>

20:16.650 --> 20:18.440
<b><i>I'm talking too much?</i></b>

20:19.060 --> 20:20.490
<b><i>I know.</i></b>

20:20.490 --> 20:22.230
<b><i>I won't say another word.</i></b>

20:22.880 --> 20:24.450
<b><i>There are</i> Nen <i>users</i></b>

20:24.450 --> 20:28.570
<b><i>who can remove other people's</i> Nen.</b>

20:32.000 --> 20:34.460
<b>East, huh...</b>

20:34.990 --> 20:39.120
<b>So, we're done with you kids.</b>

20:39.120 --> 20:42.360
<b>We just came to enjoy the auction.</b>

20:42.360 --> 20:44.470
<b>The other members wanted to go home.</b>

20:45.460 --> 20:47.770
<b>Um, what happened to Pakunoda-san?</b>

20:49.320 --> 20:50.980
<b>She died.</b>

20:51.340 --> 20:52.230
<b>Huh?</b>

20:53.520 --> 20:54.480
<b>Oh...</b>

20:55.610 --> 20:58.730
<b><i>Why don't you run away?</i></b>

20:59.500 --> 21:01.010
<b><i>Run away?</i></b>

21:01.010 --> 21:03.610
<b><i>Given my injuries, you should 
be able to escape.</i></b>

21:04.140 --> 21:06.660
<b><i>If you did, I would lose my leverage,</i></b>

21:06.660 --> 21:10.260
<b><i>and the chain user could kill the boss.</i></b>

21:10.260 --> 21:12.200
<b><i>So why don't you run away?</i></b>

21:12.200 --> 21:13.750
<b><i>Aren't you on his side?</i></b>

21:14.550 --> 21:15.870
<b><i>Because we're his friends.</i></b>

21:16.280 --> 21:20.210
<b><i>Because we're his friends, 
we don't want him to kill.</i></b>

21:20.830 --> 21:23.970
<b><i>So we'd prefer this to be 
settled with an exchange.</i></b>

21:29.370 --> 21:30.470
<b>What's wrong?</b>

21:30.470 --> 21:31.760
<b>Let's go.</b>

21:33.430 --> 21:34.360
<b>Paku...</b>

21:35.790 --> 21:39.420
<b>Paku wanted to thank you.</b>

21:46.380 --> 21:51.120

<b>Boss of the Phantom Troupe.</b>

23:11.230 --> 23:12.380
<b>The Phantom Troupe's boss.</b>

23:11.980 --> 23:13.330
<b>A Specialist.</b>

23:12.380 --> 23:13.610
<b>He's a Specialist.</b>

23:13.330 --> 23:16.370
<b>He can steal and use

23:13.610 --> 23:15.900
<b>He can steal other people's powers for himself,</b>

23:15.900 --> 23:16.900
<b>using his Skill Hunter!</b>

23:16.370 --> 23:20.080
<b>an appropriate ability

<b>But conditions have to be met.</b>

<b>Next time: Bid x And x Haste.</b>

23:28.670 --> 23:31.480
<b>A bid in haste makes waste.</b>

<b>Hey!</b>

23:32.810 --> 23:34.220
<b>That's no good...</b>
