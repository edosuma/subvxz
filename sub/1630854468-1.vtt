02:02.311 --> 02:04.479
No, I'm just
doing a little shopping.

02:04.512 --> 02:06.881
We also have shoes
in the basement.

02:09.318 --> 02:11.387
Do your other customers
know that too?

02:11.419 --> 02:13.054
Mama.

02:13.087 --> 02:15.123
Which one do you like better?

02:15.156 --> 02:16.090
Pardon me.

02:20.495 --> 02:22.665
I think I like this one.

02:22.698 --> 02:25.201
Will you really need a wallet
while you're down there?

02:25.235 --> 02:27.102
Oh, Mama. Please?

02:29.306 --> 02:30.340
Okay. Fine.

02:30.373 --> 02:32.174
Let's just go pay for it

03:19.022 --> 03:19.823
You did that.

03:19.856 --> 03:21.891
You didn't stutter,
not one time.

03:22.892 --> 03:23.793
Now, Bo, you know

03:23.827 --> 03:25.695
it's time for you

03:26.364 --> 03:27.897

I'll see you

03:42.645 --> 03:43.613
Good night, Mr. G.

03:43.646 --> 03:44.849
All right.

Oh.

03:47.118 --> 03:49.620

03:49.653 --> 03:51.555

Good night.

03:55.993 --> 03:57.528
What?
Is it my bedtime too?

03:58.330 --> 03:59.398
Could be.

04:02.099 --> 04:03.134
Good night.

04:04.269 --> 04:06.537
I'll call you
after Bo gets on the train.

04:08.473 --> 04:09.740
Mrs. Spearman.

04:10.908 --> 04:12.176
She'll see you tomorrow.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.911
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.

04:19.418 --> 04:20.885
What's wrong, Mamie?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.559
We've never been apart
this long.

04:29.362 --> 04:31.963
He's just going
to see his cousins.

04:31.997 --> 04:34.333
It's not a bad thing for him
to know where he come from.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.635
Well, Chicago is all
he needs to know.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.603
I don't want him
seeing himself

04:38.637 --> 04:40.906
the way those people
are seen down there.

04:42.174 --> 04:43.642
Those people like me?

04:45.877 --> 04:48.113
Even you
left Mississippi, Mama.

04:50.450 --> 04:53.652
Mamie, Bo is growing up.

04:54.454 --> 04:56.322
You gonna have to let him go.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.692
All right, I know that face.

05:00.725 --> 05:01.927
That is the face of

05:01.960 --> 05:04.430
"Mama, mind your business,
and go home."

05:04.464 --> 05:05.498
Where's my pocket book?

05:05.531 --> 05:06.732
Mm-hmm. Right here.

05:06.766 --> 05:07.900
Oh, there it is.

05:08.801 --> 05:11.572
You need to get you
some rest too.

05:11.604 --> 05:12.905
- I will.
- Come on, baby.

05:12.939 --> 05:14.941
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-All right.

05:20.012 --> 05:22.282

Bo, when you get down there...

07:24.207 --> 07:25.841
Oh, not again, Mama.

07:25.874 --> 07:27.410
I've already
been to Mississippi.

07:27.444 --> 07:28.811
Only one time before,

07:28.844 --> 07:31.914
and you started a fight
with another little boy.

07:31.947 --> 07:34.817
He was picking on me.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.686
You're in the right
to stand up for yourself,

07:36.720 --> 07:38.421
but that's not
what I'm talking about.

07:42.758 --> 07:44.327
Well, they have
a different set of rules

07:44.361 --> 07:45.428
for Negroes down there.

07:45.462 --> 07:46.762
Are you listening?

07:47.564 --> 07:49.332
Yes.

07:49.366 --> 07:51.768
You have to be extra careful
with White people.

07:51.801 --> 07:54.070
You can't risk looking at them
the wrong way.

07:54.104 --> 07:55.105
I know.

07:57.308 --> 07:58.309
Bo.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.078
Be small down there.

08:03.581 --> 08:04.781
Like this?

08:23.133 --> 08:24.834
Instead of your father's ring,

08:24.868 --> 08:26.337
how about you wear
the cufflinks

08:26.370 --> 08:27.638
we got you last Christmas?

08:27.672 --> 08:29.707
They'll look so handsome
on you.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.777
No, Mama.

08:31.809 --> 08:33.278
I wanna wear the ring.

08:44.623 --> 08:46.824
Thank you.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.593
Go on downstairs.

08:48.627 --> 08:50.429
I need to finish
getting ready myself.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.355
Ah, morning, Mamie!

09:15.388 --> 09:17.490
Morning, Preacher.
Good morning, Wheeler.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.890
Hi, Miss Mamie.
Hi, Bo.

09:18.924 --> 09:20.760
You're leaving
Chicago too soon.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.094
You were only here a few days.

09:22.127 --> 09:23.696
I didn't need
no more days than that.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.631
I got to see some family,
a few friends.

09:25.665 --> 09:26.766
Maybe we get you
to come down...

09:26.799 --> 09:27.866
- ...see us.
- All aboard!

09:27.899 --> 09:29.235
I like it just fine out here,
Preacher.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.035
All right, now.

09:30.068 --> 09:31.771
Bo, stay close
to your cousins.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.105
Preacher, you and Aunty Lizzie

09:33.138 --> 09:35.641
make sure Bo calls and writes
every chance he gets.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.243
I need to know he's okay.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.378
Don't worry.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.513
Me, Lizzie, and the boys
will have a stern eye on him.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.180
Goodbye, Mamie.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.385
All right, now.
Come on, Bobo.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.252
Buh-bye, Mama.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.521
Oh, Bo!
You didn't kiss me goodbye.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.088
Mama. I gotta go.

09:51.022 --> 09:52.190
Listen to Preacher.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.728
Stay with your cousins
at all times.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.497
Be extra careful.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.131
I already know.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.469
You know what?

10:03.936 --> 10:06.240
I won't need to keep the time
on my vacation.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.808
Wind it every day.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.476
Last call!
Train's leaving!

10:16.216 --> 10:18.285
Buh-bye, Mama.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.186
Come on, Bobo.
Aight, Mamie.

11:20.048 --> 11:21.383
Time to move now.

12:24.915 --> 12:26.283
Now,

12:26.316 --> 12:28.318
all you gotta do
is pinch the bract right here,

12:28.351 --> 12:30.654
so you don't
get your fingertips...

12:32.355 --> 12:35.392
Hey, look at the size
of that bird.

12:36.326 --> 12:37.661
Whoa!

12:37.694 --> 12:39.564
Where'd you get that ring?

12:39.597 --> 12:41.632
Oh, it was my daddy's.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.601
He died a hero in the war.

12:44.402 --> 12:46.136
Well, let me try it on.

12:47.038 --> 12:49.340
Um, maybe later.

12:49.740 --> 12:50.741
All right.

13:04.154 --> 13:05.590
- Bo?
- Is he all right?

13:06.089 --> 13:07.291
Bobo!

13:07.658 --> 13:08.659
Come on.

13:09.427 --> 13:11.194
Roar!

13:11.228 --> 13:14.130
From the depths
of an ancient tomb,

13:14.164 --> 13:16.701
echoes a sound
that shakes the world.

13:17.301 --> 13:19.805
Meet the mummy, Simmy!

13:19.838 --> 13:21.073
Stop!

13:21.105 --> 13:22.541
You gonna get us in trouble.

13:22.574 --> 13:26.678
Or better yet, fired.
I'm done picking these fields.

13:26.712 --> 13:28.847
What do y'all do
with all this cotton anyway?

13:29.848 --> 13:31.683
We sell it.

13:31.717 --> 13:34.419
Mr. Frederick, who own
the land, take his share.

13:34.453 --> 13:36.521
I go to market with our haul.

13:36.555 --> 13:39.358
- Sounds pretty square.
- Hmm.

13:39.391 --> 13:40.926
Pa, you gonna let him
sass you that way?

13:40.959 --> 13:42.193
What way?

13:42.227 --> 13:43.895
The boy doesn't know
where his clothes come from.

13:46.798 --> 13:47.699
Nah.

13:47.733 --> 13:49.968
I take it back, Bobo.
Stay off the farm.

13:51.637 --> 13:53.972
City boy won't even know
how he found a whuppin'.

14:32.177 --> 14:34.113
Yes, he is.

14:34.147 --> 14:35.615
Damn near pass out.

14:41.554 --> 14:43.757
Come on, sit down.
Sit down, come on.

14:48.629 --> 14:49.697
Hey, young boy.

14:51.498 --> 14:52.866
How you doin' there,
young fella?

14:52.900 --> 14:53.967
Come on, learn somethin'.

14:54.001 --> 14:55.335
Well, I'm about raised
from the dead

14:55.369 --> 14:56.603
by all this excitement.

14:58.305 --> 14:59.339
Pay attention here,

14:59.373 --> 15:00.974
you gonna let us
learn you something.

15:02.409 --> 15:03.577
I'll make damn sure.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.679
I'mma do what I do.

15:20.194 --> 15:21.528
Thank you, ma'am.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.908
You look like a movie star.

15:34.843 --> 15:35.844
What?

15:41.082 --> 15:42.283
Where's Bobo?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.185
He's in there.

15:44.220 --> 15:47.288
Simmy. See to Bobo
while he's inside.

15:53.962 --> 15:54.963
See?

16:06.275 --> 16:07.476
Come on.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.145
Bye!

16:09.178 --> 16:11.248
Buh-bye!

16:11.280 --> 16:13.282
- Come on, let's go!
- Yeah?

16:34.503 --> 16:36.705
She getting her gun.
She getting her gun, y'all.

16:36.739 --> 16:37.706
Come on! Move!

16:37.740 --> 16:38.941
-Get up, now! Come on!
-Move!

16:38.974 --> 16:41.811
Move!
She goin' to get a gun, y'all!

16:41.844 --> 16:44.413
- Get in!
- Just lay low.

16:44.446 --> 16:45.649
Come on, Mau!

17:53.651 --> 17:55.052
Why aren't you at work?

17:57.289 --> 17:58.556
Is everything okay?

18:00.691 --> 18:03.060
That trip we planned
to take Bo on?

18:03.461 --> 18:04.662
Let's go now.

18:06.365 --> 18:08.567
You wanna go right now?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.068
You said you weren't feeling
that well.

18:10.102 --> 18:12.604
I was just missing Bo.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.811
I'm still missing Bo.

18:19.845 --> 18:21.580
We have never been apart
this long,

18:21.613 --> 18:23.316
and he's gonna be gone
another week.

18:23.349 --> 18:25.218
I need to keep doing things

18:25.251 --> 18:28.553
to take my mind off
of this feelin'.

18:31.690 --> 18:32.691
Okay.

18:33.393 --> 18:35.694
I can't go right now, but, uh,

18:36.296 --> 18:37.397
we'll try in a few days.

18:37.429 --> 18:40.165
Promise me
we'll go on the trip?

18:41.867 --> 18:42.868
Of course.

18:58.551 --> 19:01.388
I'm trying not to act
so silly!

19:01.422 --> 19:02.855
Better watch yourself.

19:04.090 --> 19:06.360
I don't know,
'cause when he looks at me,

19:06.393 --> 19:08.429
I just lose my mind!

19:08.461 --> 19:10.797
Oh!
But just be yourself.

19:10.830 --> 19:14.000
Okay. I'll try.
It's gonna be all right.

19:18.571 --> 19:21.342
Oh! Nice try.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.842
It's a high-speed
competition, huh?

19:22.875 --> 19:24.911
They call you city boy,
or somethin'?

19:27.414 --> 19:29.048
Think you so damn funny, huh?

19:31.419 --> 19:32.720
Why you whistle like that?

19:33.787 --> 19:36.358
Look, it's been three days,
okay?

19:36.391 --> 19:37.624
And we haven't heard
nothin' more

19:37.658 --> 19:38.892
about what I did in Money.

19:38.926 --> 19:40.928
That's 'cause no one knows
your face 'round here.

19:40.961 --> 19:42.330
That don't mean
they not in one of 'em cars

19:42.364 --> 19:43.398
looking for us.

19:43.431 --> 19:45.032
Look, I said I was sorry.

19:46.234 --> 19:47.868
We gotta tell Pappa.

19:47.901 --> 19:50.271
We all agreed
we wouldn't say anything.

19:50.305 --> 19:51.805
He'll make
Bobo go home.

19:51.839 --> 19:53.540
So what?

19:53.574 --> 19:55.477
You don't see what's been
going on around here?

19:55.509 --> 19:56.710
They killin' Negroes

19:56.744 --> 19:59.414
for doing way less
than what you did in Money.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.282
You ain't no White man, Bobo.
You one of us!

20:01.316 --> 20:02.549
Hey, leave him alone, Maurice.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.352
Mrs. Bryant must've kept it
to herself.

20:04.386 --> 20:05.886
No one has to know.

20:24.706 --> 20:27.443
Willie Mae, Ollie,

20:27.476 --> 20:29.978
I swear you two are losing
on purpose.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.913
Yeah, well, you must have
all the luck tonight, Mamie.

20:31.946 --> 20:33.915
Mm-hmm.

20:33.948 --> 20:35.583
Now, we've been here
all night,

20:35.617 --> 20:37.919
and you still haven't told us
what's bothering you.

20:37.952 --> 20:39.388
I'm fine.

20:39.422 --> 20:41.257
I got a letter today
from Aunty Lizzie.

20:41.290 --> 20:44.460
She said Bo is really happy.
That's all I needed to hear.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.860
Mm.

20:45.894 --> 20:47.128
- That's real good, Mamie.
-  -Mm-hmm.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.097
My boy, Curtis, just made it
down to Mississippi.

20:49.130 --> 20:49.998
I already told Uncle,

20:50.031 --> 20:51.733
"Make sure he see Bo
tomorrow."

20:51.766 --> 20:53.069
Bo would like that.

20:53.102 --> 20:54.203
Yeah.

20:54.237 --> 20:55.838
It'd be nice for him
to have another friend...

20:55.871 --> 20:57.907
- ...from the city there with him.
-  -Mm-hmm.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.642
Oh, he just
doesn't understand

20:59.675 --> 21:01.411
how different things are
down there.

21:01.445 --> 21:02.645
Yeah.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.449
Aunty Lizzie said
Bo's been working the fields.

21:05.482 --> 21:07.517
Oh!

21:07.551 --> 21:10.853
I can't imagine
Bo in the hot sun

21:10.886 --> 21:12.688
all day pulling some cotton.

21:12.721 --> 21:14.090
No.

21:14.123 --> 21:17.561
But Aunty Lizzie said I raised
one nice, hardworking boy.

21:17.593 --> 21:19.161
- That's my Bo.
- Yes.

21:23.599 --> 21:25.835
Can't believe
he's been gone a week.

21:26.836 --> 21:29.004
Gene and I wanna take
a trip soon,

21:29.038 --> 21:31.241
but I really wanna go down
to Mississippi

21:31.274 --> 21:32.741
and bring my son home.

21:33.677 --> 21:36.079
If Bo could just
get his feet back

21:36.113 --> 21:39.082
onto the Chicago soil,
he'd be one happy kid.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.859
I... I don't know
why I said that.

21:53.663 --> 21:55.299
Looks like
your little winning streak

21:55.333 --> 21:56.334
is over, Mamie.

22:00.770 --> 22:03.474
Well, look at that.

22:03.508 --> 22:04.908
You wanna play
one more hand?

22:04.941 --> 22:05.742
Sure.

22:05.775 --> 22:07.278
But you deal this time.

22:07.311 --> 22:09.646
Absolutely.
You still gonna lose.

22:13.717 --> 22:15.853
These cards, girl.

22:16.988 --> 22:18.723
<i>A grand jury has declined</i>

22:18.756 --> 22:20.024
<i>to indict the suspect</i>

22:20.057 --> 22:22.294
<i>for the murder of Reverend</i>
<i>George Washington Lee,</i>

22:22.327 --> 22:25.631

<i>hundreds of Negroes</i>

22:31.903 --> 22:33.438
<i>to vote for the first time.</i>

22:41.012 --> 22:43.248
Pappa, you and Mama
ain't asleep?

22:43.282 --> 22:44.182
Mm.

22:44.215 --> 22:46.684
How can we sleep
when y'all ain't home yet?

22:46.717 --> 22:48.620
What'd you boys
get into tonight?

22:48.654 --> 22:50.556
Nothing much, Daddy.
Just taking Bobo around.

22:50.589 --> 22:51.923
Mm.

22:51.956 --> 22:53.559
All right. Night, Ma.
Night, Pa.

22:53.592 --> 22:54.660
- Good night.
- Night night.

22:54.692 --> 22:55.827
Good night.

22:58.531 --> 22:59.731
Bobo!

23:03.469 --> 23:04.703
We leaving early tomorrow

23:04.736 --> 23:06.805
to mail that letter out
to your mama, you hear?

23:07.574 --> 23:10.677
Okay. Good night.

23:10.709 --> 23:12.378
Good night.

23:12.412 --> 23:15.515
That was close.

23:15.548 --> 23:18.183
<i>...after having</i>
<i>registered dozens of Negroes</i>

23:18.217 --> 23:20.486
<i>to vote</i>

23:20.520 --> 23:22.754
<i>No charges have been made.</i>

24:49.611 --> 24:50.878
Preacher!

24:51.646 --> 24:52.913
Preacher!

24:54.014 --> 24:55.383
Who is it?

24:55.417 --> 24:56.251
It's Mr. Bryant.

24:56.284 --> 24:58.486
I wanna talk to you
about that boy.

25:01.022 --> 25:01.856
Sir?

25:01.890 --> 25:02.991
I want that boy

25:03.024 --> 25:05.093
who did the talking down
in Money.

25:05.761 --> 25:08.129
Talking, sir? What talking?

25:08.163 --> 25:09.964
Open up this door,
Preacher!

25:12.268 --> 25:13.269
Bobo!

25:14.869 --> 25:17.205
You better open up
this door, Preacher!

25:17.239 --> 25:18.741
Bobo! Wake up!

25:19.908 --> 25:21.711
Leave me alone.

25:21.744 --> 25:22.778
Get up! Someone's come!

25:22.812 --> 25:24.313
You know
who I'm talking about!

25:24.347 --> 25:25.381
So what?

25:25.414 --> 25:26.848
They've come for you!

25:26.881 --> 25:28.250
I don't know.

25:28.284 --> 25:29.352
Who's come?

25:30.720 --> 25:32.755
I don't know what you mean,
Mr. Bryant.

25:32.788 --> 25:35.056
You got that boy
from Chicago.

25:55.878 --> 25:57.447
You that big mouth nigger?

25:58.415 --> 25:59.349
Who are you?

26:00.182 --> 26:01.585
Get your clothes on.

26:05.355 --> 26:08.392
Mr. Bryant,
you ain't got to do this.

26:08.425 --> 26:09.659
He just a young boy.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.993
Better shut them eyes.

26:11.026 --> 26:12.429
- Oh!
- Simmy!

26:23.341 --> 26:25.909
You don't need
no goddamn socks, boy.

26:28.246 --> 26:30.415
I... I don't wear shoes
without socks.

26:32.517 --> 26:34.017
Don't talk back to them!

26:34.050 --> 26:35.553
We just gonna
teach him a lesson.

26:35.586 --> 26:36.754
Stay right here, Simmy!

26:36.788 --> 26:37.889
- Please!
- Move!

26:37.921 --> 26:39.290
- Don't take him!
- Move!

26:39.323 --> 26:42.125
I'll whup him
if he's done something wrong!

26:42.159 --> 26:44.729
We'll give you money.

26:44.762 --> 26:45.863
Watch out.

26:45.897 --> 26:47.097
We don't need no money!

26:47.832 --> 26:48.766
Please!

26:48.800 --> 26:50.635
The boy ain't got good sense.

26:50.668 --> 26:51.968
He's gonna learn!

26:55.071 --> 26:56.441
But, Mr. Bryant!

26:59.943 --> 27:01.245
What'd you say
to my brother?

27:14.793 --> 27:15.993
All right. Get up.

27:19.231 --> 27:20.332
Carolyn!

27:21.500 --> 27:22.668
Is this the right nigger?

27:28.440 --> 27:29.575
That's the one.

27:30.342 --> 27:31.376
All right.

27:33.779 --> 27:34.947
Get off me.

27:34.979 --> 27:36.648
Shut up, boy! Shut up.

27:39.318 --> 27:41.753
All right.

28:40.881 --> 28:42.148
Look at me, boy!

28:44.150 --> 28:45.519
Hold him down!

28:47.120 --> 28:49.188
Watch it, now!

28:51.157 --> 28:52.191
Shut your mouth!

28:54.193 --> 28:55.930
Come on. Get up! Get up!

28:55.963 --> 28:56.997
Hold him up!

29:45.981 --> 29:47.182
Hello?

29:53.289 --> 29:55.424
Get out of the way, Gene!
I gotta get to Money!

29:55.458 --> 29:57.093
Money? Money?
Mamie, what's going on?

29:57.125 --> 29:58.327
They took Bo!

29:58.361 --> 29:59.662
-Who took Bo?
-I...

29:59.695 --> 30:01.764
Preacher told me two men came
and got Bo last night.

30:01.797 --> 30:03.299
I couldn't hear anything else
after that.

30:03.332 --> 30:04.967
-I gotta find Bo!
-Mamie! Mamie! Mamie!

30:05.001 --> 30:08.104
Mamie, let's go inside,
call your mama,

30:08.136 --> 30:10.138
try and get in touch with
Preacher and Aunty Lizzie

30:10.171 --> 30:11.374
for more information, okay?

30:12.408 --> 30:14.377
Come on. Come on.

30:16.912 --> 30:19.849
We give you
all the glory, Lord.

30:19.882 --> 30:21.617
-Glory to God.
-Yes.

30:21.651 --> 30:25.087
Glory to God.
Yes, Lord. Glory to God.

30:25.121 --> 30:27.155
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

30:27.188 --> 30:29.760
He's going to bring him
back to you, baby.

30:31.028 --> 30:32.362
Yes, ma'am.

30:34.931 --> 30:36.133
Alma.

30:36.165 --> 30:37.534
Thank you.

30:40.671 --> 30:41.672
Mamie.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.341
Alma.

30:45.308 --> 30:46.843
You weren't going to tell me?

30:48.245 --> 30:49.913
I called your wife.

30:52.849 --> 30:56.687
No matter the differences
between me and your mother,

30:57.254 --> 30:58.922
I'm still your father.

31:00.157 --> 31:01.358
Mamie,

31:02.659 --> 31:04.928
we're gonna find Bo.

31:04.961 --> 31:07.330
- Mm.
- Sit down.

31:07.364 --> 31:10.702
I brought your cousin along
to help us.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.305
Do you remember Rayfield?
Rayfield Mooty.

31:15.373 --> 31:18.409
Came by the house a lot
when you was a kid.

31:18.443 --> 31:21.145
He works with some
powerful Negro people

31:21.179 --> 31:22.947
who can help us find Bo.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.284
It's been a long time, ma'am.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.286
- Nice to see you again.
- Mm.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.521
Mamie.

31:31.522 --> 31:34.492
Oh. I'm sorry.

31:34.525 --> 31:37.795
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Mooty.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.229
I've, uh...

31:40.865 --> 31:45.570
I've been in touch
with Mr. William Huff,

31:45.603 --> 31:49.340
counsel for the NAACP chapter
here in Chicago.

31:49.373 --> 31:52.244
He wants to meet with you
first thing tomorrow morning.

31:52.277 --> 31:55.547
I've included the address
to his office.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.516
Here.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.787
He has political connections

32:01.820 --> 32:03.722
throughout the state
of Mississippi.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.225
And he's in regular contact
with Mayor Daley,

32:06.291 --> 32:08.894
Congressman Dawson,
and Governor Stratton.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.898
I do know the NAACP,

32:12.931 --> 32:16.668
and it sounds like
he knows the right people

32:16.702 --> 32:20.272
who can help me find Bo.

32:22.242 --> 32:24.042
Well, I'll meet you
in Mr. Huff's office

32:24.076 --> 32:25.744
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.715
- Thanks, Ray.
- Mm-hmm.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.284
I will see you soon.

32:35.822 --> 32:37.857
Hey.

32:39.726 --> 32:42.629

and you have the meeting
right after that.

33:35.115 --> 33:36.483
Morning!

33:36.517 --> 33:37.985
Hi, John.
How are you today?

33:56.272 --> 33:58.373
Mr. Huff,
this is Mrs. Bradley.

33:58.406 --> 34:00.609
Thank you for meeting with us,
Mr. Huff.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.544
- And Mr. Mobley.
- Yes, thank you.

34:02.577 --> 34:05.547
I have great respect
for your cousin.

34:05.580 --> 34:07.616
His work with the
United Steelworkers has helped

34:07.649 --> 34:10.385
to make it one of
the strongest Negro unions.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.521
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

34:17.993 --> 34:18.994
Are you employed?

34:20.661 --> 34:21.862
I work for the Air Force.

34:21.897 --> 34:23.864
She's the only Negro woman
in the office.

34:26.501 --> 34:27.936
Mrs. Bradley.

34:29.371 --> 34:30.605
You two aren't married?

34:31.940 --> 34:32.974
Um...

34:33.007 --> 34:34.074
No.

34:34.109 --> 34:35.444
Not yet, anyway.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.713
Where's Emmett's father?

34:39.815 --> 34:43.452
Louis Till died overseas
about 10 years ago.

34:43.485 --> 34:44.887
Uh, during the war.

34:46.222 --> 34:47.956
And Mr. Bradley?

34:50.493 --> 34:52.628
You have a lot of questions
for me, Mr. Huff.

34:52.661 --> 34:55.630
And none of them seem to have
anything to do with my son.

35:01.971 --> 35:03.407
I've been briefed
on your case.

35:03.439 --> 35:05.775
Bo is not a case.

35:08.744 --> 35:10.680
I've drafted
two telegrams to send.

35:10.713 --> 35:12.882
One to Governor White
in Mississippi.

35:12.915 --> 35:14.351
The other
to Governor Stratton,

35:14.384 --> 35:15.986
here in Illinois.

35:16.019 --> 35:17.955
It's important they know
about Emmett.

35:18.956 --> 35:20.824
We're currently investigating
the murders

35:20.857 --> 35:22.893
of Lamar Smith
and Reverend Lee.

35:22.926 --> 35:25.829
They did a lot of work getting
Negroes registered to vote.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.432
Because of what happened
to them,

35:27.464 --> 35:28.799
the Negro press in Mississippi

35:28.832 --> 35:31.402
started to write
about Emmett's kidnapping,

35:31.436 --> 35:33.904
but it's not creating
enough pressure needed

35:33.937 --> 35:37.107
to force them
into a state-wide search.

35:39.009 --> 35:40.577
Now, as your counsel,

35:40.610 --> 35:44.248
I'd like to utilize all of
the press here in Chicago.

35:44.282 --> 35:45.450
It's more likely
to get picked up

35:45.482 --> 35:47.318
by other cities that way.

35:47.352 --> 35:49.086
You're gonna have to talk
to reporters,

35:50.421 --> 35:51.922
speak in front of cameras.

35:52.622 --> 35:55.259
So... we like to make sure

35:55.293 --> 35:58.997
that the person who's telling
the story is in public favor.

36:01.433 --> 36:03.868
It's better that I ask you
questions now

36:03.901 --> 36:06.671
than some reporter
finding something later.

36:11.709 --> 36:13.077
The reverend and Mr. Lee,

36:13.111 --> 36:15.980
I heard they were killed
right before Bo got down there.

36:16.014 --> 36:17.249
Mamie...

36:17.282 --> 36:21.019
I know these Citizen Councils
are everywhere in Mississippi.

36:21.052 --> 36:23.154
You think they had a part
in any of it?

36:26.291 --> 36:28.460
When the message
to White people

36:28.494 --> 36:32.163
is to stop Negroes
from voting or advancing,

36:33.332 --> 36:35.267
by any means
short of violence,

36:36.667 --> 36:37.870
it's only a matter of time

36:37.903 --> 36:40.639
before someone doesn't
stop short of it.

36:42.375 --> 36:44.810
Let's just focus
on finding Bo.

36:50.549 --> 36:52.151
Why do you call him "Bo"?

36:55.687 --> 36:57.956
When I was carrying him,

36:59.359 --> 37:01.528
my mama's friend
would bring him gifts

37:01.560 --> 37:03.862
all the time, and say,

37:03.896 --> 37:05.864
"Here's another one
for little Bobo."

37:07.500 --> 37:10.702
After he was born,
it just stuck.

37:14.573 --> 37:17.109
He was a perfect baby.

37:17.142 --> 37:21.114
Born breech, and had
his share of problems, but...

37:23.716 --> 37:27.187
he was a perfect baby.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.875
Hi, we live across the street

37:48.908 --> 37:50.910
and read about
what happened to Emmett.

37:50.944 --> 37:54.114
Everybody in the neighborhood
knows that sweet little boy.

37:59.987 --> 38:01.523
But maybe
somebody will read the paper,

38:01.556 --> 38:02.823
and they'll know Bo's ours.

38:02.857 --> 38:05.192
I don't care
what anyone thinks Bo did

38:05.226 --> 38:07.061
or did not do in that store.

38:07.094 --> 38:09.997
They took my child,
and I need him back.

38:12.133 --> 38:14.101
Hello? Mr. Huff!

38:15.035 --> 38:17.506
Yes, yes, yes. I'll get Mamie.

38:17.539 --> 38:19.106
Sounds like he has good news.

38:20.542 --> 38:21.809
Mr. Huff?

38:22.776 --> 38:24.513
He wrote back?

38:24.546 --> 38:26.381
The governor wants to talk
to Mr. Huff

38:26.414 --> 38:27.948
about what happened to Bo.

38:27.982 --> 38:28.983
Thank you.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.985
Thank you for the update,
Mr. Huff.

38:32.554 --> 38:35.022
Okay. I'll be in touch.

38:51.607 --> 38:53.041
A reporter called me.

38:56.044 --> 38:58.213
He didn't wanna
tell you himself.

39:04.085 --> 39:06.656
Bo's body was found
in a river.

39:06.688 --> 39:08.990
Preacher just identified him
to the sheriff.

39:09.024 --> 39:13.695
He... He recognized the ring
Bo was wearing.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.168
I'm so sorry, Mamie.

39:21.770 --> 39:23.340
He's...

39:24.240 --> 39:25.509
He's dead.

40:14.292 --> 40:16.960
<i>This is</i>
<i>a breaking news bulletin.</i>

40:17.761 --> 40:19.062
<i>We interrupt this broadcast</i>

40:19.096 --> 40:20.431
<i>to report</i>
<i>a breaking news story.</i>

40:20.465 --> 40:24.868
<i>The body of Emmett Louis Till</i>
<i>has been found dead</i>

40:24.901 --> 40:27.838
<i>in the Tallahatchie River</i>
<i>near Money, Mississippi.</i>

40:27.871 --> 40:30.275
<i>Till, a Negro boy</i>
<i>from Chicago, was kidnapped</i>

40:30.308 --> 40:32.809
<i>while visiting relatives</i>
<i>in Money, Mississippi.</i>

40:32.843 --> 40:34.279
<i>Again, that breaking news.</i>

40:34.312 --> 40:37.080
<i>The body of Emmett Louis Till</i>
<i>has been found in Mississippi.</i>

40:37.114 --> 40:38.683
<i>We'll have details ahead...</i>

40:38.716 --> 40:40.050
<i>...and J.W. Milam</i>

40:40.083 --> 40:41.985
<i>were already in police custody</i>

40:42.019 --> 40:43.655
<i>after admitting</i>
<i>to the kidnapping,</i>

40:43.688 --> 40:45.890
<i>but they now face</i>
<i>possible indictment</i>

40:45.923 --> 40:47.459
<i>for the murder of Till.</i>

40:47.493 --> 40:52.298
<i>We have proved</i>
<i>by two or three witnesses</i>

40:52.331 --> 40:54.832
<i>that the body found</i>
<i>in Tallahatchie River</i>

40:54.866 --> 40:56.402
<i>was that of Emmett Till.</i>

40:56.435 --> 40:58.836
<i>We proved</i>
<i>that the body had the ring...</i>

40:58.870 --> 41:00.071
<i>...this lynching</i>

41:00.104 --> 41:01.939
<i>that the state of Mississippi</i>
<i>has decided</i>

41:01.973 --> 41:03.875
<i>to maintain</i>
<i>this White supremacy</i>

41:03.908 --> 41:06.378
<i>by murdering children.</i>

41:07.812 --> 41:10.181
<i>Look, it was because</i>
<i>he was a boy,</i>

41:10.214 --> 41:12.418
<i>that's why they went there.</i>

41:12.451 --> 41:15.654
<i>They had to prove</i>
<i>that they were superior.</i>

41:15.688 --> 41:17.155
<i>They had to prove it</i>

41:17.188 --> 41:21.125
<i>by taking away</i>
<i>a 14-year-old boy.</i>

41:21.159 --> 41:22.628
Mamie, you need
to eat something.

41:22.661 --> 41:24.929
<i>The killers of the boy</i>
<i>felt free to lynch him</i>

41:24.962 --> 41:26.131
<i>because there is,</i>

41:26.165 --> 41:27.334
<i>in the entire state...</i>

41:27.367 --> 41:30.403
<i>...no restraining influence</i>
<i>of decency.</i>

41:31.203 --> 41:32.104
<i>Hate.</i>

41:32.838 --> 41:34.407
<i>It's like a virus in the blood</i>

41:34.441 --> 41:35.908
<i>of the Mississippians.</i>

41:35.941 --> 41:37.644
<i>They can't help it.</i>

41:37.677 --> 41:39.144
<i>That was Roy Wilkins...</i>

41:39.178 --> 41:42.081
<i>- ...the executive director</i>
<i>of the NAACP...</i>

41:42.114 --> 41:43.416
You mind
if I speak with Mamie?

41:43.450 --> 41:44.950
<i>...giving his</i>
<i>reaction to the recent killing</i>

41:44.983 --> 41:48.087
<i>of 14-year-old Negro boy,</i>
<i>Emmett Till.</i>

41:48.120 --> 41:50.189
<i>Burial preparations</i>
<i>by local sheriffs</i>

41:50.222 --> 41:51.857
<i>have already started</i>

41:51.890 --> 41:53.992
<i>in Tallahatchie County,</i>
<i>Mississippi,</i>

41:54.026 --> 41:55.894
<i>where Till's body was found.</i>

41:55.928 --> 41:56.995
Mamie?

41:57.029 --> 41:57.896
<i>Negro leaders are calling</i>

41:57.930 --> 41:59.332
<i>on local and federal officials</i>

41:59.366 --> 42:02.602
<i>to investigate the murder,</i>
<i>and to indict J.W. Milam...</i>

42:32.600 --> 42:33.567
Uh...

42:37.671 --> 42:41.141
-My sincere condolences...
-Stop.

42:42.610 --> 42:43.611
I can't.

42:48.215 --> 42:50.485
I need Bo's body
sent back here.

42:52.086 --> 42:54.054
I can't have him buried
in Mississippi.

42:54.088 --> 42:56.291
Mississippi won't make
that deal with you.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.325
Then make them.

43:00.094 --> 43:03.765
I'm sure Mr. Huff
can get Mayor Daley

43:03.799 --> 43:05.667
or the governor
to talk to somebody.

43:08.068 --> 43:09.236
Those people in Mississippi

43:09.271 --> 43:11.640
are trying to dump Bo
in the ground

43:11.673 --> 43:13.642
like he's just another body.

43:13.675 --> 43:15.042
He is my baby.

43:17.144 --> 43:18.547
I need to see him.

43:26.954 --> 43:28.457
I'll speak with Mr. Huff.

43:28.490 --> 43:29.459
Thank you.

43:40.168 --> 43:42.103
You know...

43:44.239 --> 43:47.042
Mamie, you have the public's
attention right now.

43:49.879 --> 43:51.146
And, uh,

43:52.415 --> 43:54.917
it would be in
a politician's best interest

43:54.951 --> 43:57.018
to help you
during an election year.

44:00.055 --> 44:02.391
There's an opportunity in that.

44:08.698 --> 44:10.734
Uh...

44:10.767 --> 44:15.706
Some organizers and executive
members of the NAACP

44:15.739 --> 44:18.575
have been speaking
with the justice department

44:18.609 --> 44:19.943
about creating legislation

44:19.977 --> 44:22.513
that would make lynching
a federal crime.

44:25.282 --> 44:28.318
What happened to Reverend Lee
was a lynching.

44:29.218 --> 44:32.054
Lamar Smith. A lynching.

44:34.691 --> 44:35.592
-Emmett...
-I...

44:37.026 --> 44:39.228
uh...

44:39.997 --> 44:43.567
We have an opportunity

44:43.600 --> 44:48.070
to use this moment to help us
pass this legislation.

44:48.104 --> 44:50.641
Might even help you get
an indictment.

44:50.674 --> 44:51.910
Maybe even a conviction.

44:51.943 --> 44:55.380
I can't think about that
right now.

44:55.413 --> 44:58.683
I just need Bo's body
sent back here.

44:58.716 --> 45:02.453
Well, the public's paying
attention right now, Mamie.

45:03.721 --> 45:06.056
See, this doesn't just have
to be about Emmett.

45:06.089 --> 45:08.760
Mr. Mooty, my son is dead!

45:24.174 --> 45:27.812
Make sure
Mr. Huff handles this today.

45:34.085 --> 45:35.421
Yes, ma'am.

46:26.406 --> 46:30.710
Rayfield's ready to
take us to the train station.

46:35.515 --> 46:38.952
I, uh, got you a wheelchair.

46:38.985 --> 46:40.453
You know, just in case.

46:41.788 --> 46:43.356
I don't want you falling down.

46:50.363 --> 46:51.798
Preacher called again.

46:51.831 --> 46:55.469
He keeps trying
to apologize to you, Mamie.

46:59.373 --> 47:00.641
Aunty Lizzie's coming up here.

47:00.675 --> 47:03.811
He has to stay behind
to finish working the fields

47:03.844 --> 47:05.780
and talk to the prosecutor.

47:16.791 --> 47:18.893
I keep asking myself...

47:22.430 --> 47:24.265
"Why is this happening?

47:28.636 --> 47:31.405
"Why did he take my child
from me?

47:38.513 --> 47:40.816
"What am I
supposed to do now?"

47:50.492 --> 47:53.361
Yeah. I have to say goodbye
to Mama.

48:06.908 --> 48:07.909
Mama.

48:33.169 --> 48:35.338
I'm the one who told him
to go down there.

48:38.341 --> 48:40.576
I wanted him to go down there.

48:45.848 --> 48:47.517
I told him to go down.

48:50.720 --> 48:53.422
I told him to go down there.

49:40.939 --> 49:43.408
All right. Get that.

50:07.333 --> 50:08.967
Oh, my God!

50:10.269 --> 50:12.570
My boy!

50:12.604 --> 50:16.407
My boy! My only child!

50:16.441 --> 50:18.776
My only boy!

50:20.846 --> 50:24.950
Oh, my Lord!
Get him out of that box!

50:26.319 --> 50:29.322
Get him out of the box!

50:29.356 --> 50:32.758
Get him out of the box!
He can't breathe!

50:34.059 --> 50:36.829
He can't breathe. My Lord!

50:38.931 --> 50:41.901
Oh, Lord, have mercy!

50:42.935 --> 50:44.271
Help me!

50:46.373 --> 50:49.174
Oh, my God!

50:51.143 --> 50:54.513
Oh, Lord, have mercy!

50:55.282 --> 50:58.417
Show me
what you want me to do.

50:58.450 --> 51:01.588
Oh, Lord, show me
what you want me to do

51:01.621 --> 51:04.257
and make me able to do it!

51:04.292 --> 51:06.092
My Lord!

51:17.371 --> 51:18.738
I need to prepare you.

51:23.977 --> 51:25.478
Remove the sheet.

51:35.221 --> 51:38.458
Oh, God.

51:51.639 --> 51:54.075
Everyone, leave us.

55:17.116 --> 55:18.485
How long
will it take you

55:18.518 --> 55:20.252
to turn the body over to us?

55:20.287 --> 55:21.521
Figure out the next step.

55:21.555 --> 55:23.122
Talk to the church.

55:23.155 --> 55:26.792
Gene, can you go back
to my place

55:26.825 --> 55:29.128
and bring back
Emmett's black suit?

55:29.161 --> 55:31.730
The one he wore
last Christmas.

55:31.764 --> 55:33.633
Mama can tell you
exactly where it is.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.569
And make sure
to get my black dress

55:35.602 --> 55:37.304
that Bo would approve of.

55:37.337 --> 55:39.038
And his matching tie.

55:40.806 --> 55:42.676
Emmett loved this suit.

55:42.708 --> 55:44.344
It's how he'd like to be seen.

55:46.111 --> 55:47.112
Seen?

55:48.448 --> 55:51.751
Mamie, Bo's in no kind of
shape to be seen by anybody.

55:51.785 --> 55:54.854
No, he's in just
the right shape.

55:54.888 --> 55:59.059
The whole world has to see
what happened to my son.

55:59.092 --> 56:02.663
Mrs. Bradley, can I
at least fix him up a bit?

56:02.697 --> 56:03.763
Just to make him more...

56:03.797 --> 56:06.132
No one's going to believe
what I just saw.

56:06.434 --> 56:07.267
No.

56:07.301 --> 56:10.103
They have to see it
for themselves.

56:38.132 --> 56:39.800
Ms. Bradley,
what would you like to say

56:39.834 --> 56:40.868
to the men who did this?

56:40.901 --> 56:42.471
What's that smell?

56:44.473 --> 56:48.277
That smell is my son's body.

56:48.310 --> 56:52.314
He came home to me
reeking of racial hatred.

56:52.347 --> 56:54.283
His face was bludgeoned.

56:54.316 --> 56:56.385
His teeth are gone.

56:56.418 --> 56:57.885
He was shot in the head.

56:58.754 --> 57:02.457
And now I want America
to bear witness.

57:06.528 --> 57:07.928
Come with me, please.

57:09.731 --> 57:10.766
Right here, Ms. Bradley.

57:10.798 --> 57:12.167
Ms. Bradley, right here.

57:12.200 --> 57:13.469
Do you have a
message for the perpetrators?

57:13.503 --> 57:15.505
Will there be
a service, Ms. Bradley?

57:18.741 --> 57:21.277
Gene, please come be with me.

57:52.408 --> 57:54.378
<i>News of</i>
<i>an open-casket funeral</i>

57:54.411 --> 57:57.013
<i>for the slain</i>
<i>14-year-old Emmett Till</i>

57:57.046 --> 57:58.915
<i>has spread</i>

57:58.948 --> 58:01.184
<i>Many people were in shock</i>
<i>over the brutal slaying</i>

58:01.217 --> 58:02.885
<i>and couldn't believe</i>
<i>something like this</i>

58:02.919 --> 58:04.488
<i>could happen to a child.</i>

58:04.521 --> 58:06.757
<i>My heart goes out</i>
<i>to her. I'm a mother too.</i>

58:06.790 --> 58:08.224
<i>It could be any one of us.</i>

58:08.257 --> 58:10.794
<i>The right thing is to</i>
<i>show America, and the world,</i>

58:10.828 --> 58:11.928
<i>exactly what happened.</i>

58:11.961 --> 58:13.262
<i>We know</i>
<i>the boy was killed,</i>

58:13.297 --> 58:15.466
<i>but you're making a freak show</i>
<i>of his death.</i>

58:15.499 --> 58:16.767
<i>I think she brave.</i>

58:16.800 --> 58:18.101
<i>Can't we just grieve</i>

58:18.134 --> 58:19.936
<i>This stuff ain't</i>
<i>gonna stop till we see it.</i>

58:19.969 --> 58:21.338
<i>I support her.</i>

58:21.372 --> 58:23.807
<i>It is my</i>
<i>opinion that the guilt begins</i>

58:23.841 --> 58:25.309
<i>with Mrs. Bryant...</i>

58:25.342 --> 58:27.745
<i>...and I wanna see</i>
<i>Mrs. Bryant punished,</i>

58:27.778 --> 58:29.279
<i>those two men punished,</i>

58:29.313 --> 58:32.483
<i>and any other persons</i>
<i>who were in on this thing.</i>

58:32.516 --> 58:33.484
<i>The pressure should start</i>

58:33.517 --> 58:35.720
<i>from the president</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

58:35.754 --> 58:37.489
<i>all the way down</i>
<i>to the township</i>

58:37.522 --> 58:39.123
<i>of Money, Mississippi.</i>

58:39.156 --> 58:41.158
<i>I won't rest</i>
<i>until that happens,</i>

58:41.191 --> 58:44.429
<i>even if I have to go</i>
<i>to Money, Mississippi myself.</i>

58:44.462 --> 58:45.797
<i>Do you have any evidence</i>

58:45.830 --> 58:47.030
<i>bearing on this case?</i>

58:47.064 --> 58:49.933
<i>I do know</i>
<i>that this is my son.</i>

59:24.135 --> 59:26.639
You're not just my Bo anymore.

59:31.009 --> 59:32.076
Mamie...

59:35.448 --> 59:37.115
Aunty Lizzie.

59:40.386 --> 59:43.889
Simmy and Maurice stayed back
with their daddy.

59:43.923 --> 59:46.057
It was probably too much.

59:49.428 --> 59:50.596
I'm so sorry.

59:53.164 --> 59:57.102
When those men came, I tried.

59:58.839 --> 01:00:01.273
We all tried.

01:00:02.909 --> 01:00:04.444
I ain't going back, Mamie.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.314
I packed my stuff up,

01:00:07.347 --> 01:00:09.382
and I'm staying here for good.

01:00:10.283 --> 01:00:12.117
Preacher and the boys
will join me.

01:00:15.689 --> 01:00:17.056
I can't look, Mamie.

01:00:25.432 --> 01:00:26.433

and she is going to be fine.

01:03:32.991 --> 01:03:37.194
Carolyn Bryant
is going to be fine.

01:03:44.502 --> 01:03:46.137
You know,
to get a murder indictment

01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:48.907
on two White men
in Mississippi is not easy.

01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:56.748
You did that, Mamie.

01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:02.655
Now...

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:07.927
Their defense...

01:04:10.296 --> 01:04:11.964
is going to try
to create doubt

01:04:11.997 --> 01:04:14.133
about the body being Emmett's.

01:04:14.166 --> 01:04:16.368
There's no body,
there's no murder conviction,

01:04:16.402 --> 01:04:19.939
and Bryant and Milam will only
face kidnapping charges.

01:04:25.511 --> 01:04:27.780
You know your child
better than anyone.

01:04:31.016 --> 01:04:32.852
You saw the body soon after.

01:04:35.688 --> 01:04:40.059
There is no testimony
like a mother's.

01:05:18.265 --> 01:05:19.733
Aren't we going
to your mama's tonight?

01:05:23.303 --> 01:05:25.506
I need to go to Mississippi
for the trial.

01:05:27.008 --> 01:05:30.444
I can testify that it was
Bo's body found in the river.

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:44.926
When do you want us to go?

01:05:48.329 --> 01:05:50.264
Gene, I have to go without you.

01:05:50.299 --> 01:05:53.000
-What?
-Mr. Mooty has arranged for me
to meet some people

01:05:53.034 --> 01:05:54.402
-down there.
-If you're going
to Mississippi,

01:05:54.435 --> 01:05:55.736
-I'm going with you.
-Mr. Huff and Mr. Mooty

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:57.104
don't think that's a good idea,

01:05:57.138 --> 01:05:58.973
-and I agree with them.
-I don't care what they think!

01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:02.311
They keep telling us

01:06:02.343 --> 01:06:03.644
what to do
and who you can talk to.

01:06:03.678 --> 01:06:06.381
And I go along with it
because I lost Bo too.

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:09.852
I would do anything for him.

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:16.525
You tell me, Mamie.

01:06:17.459 --> 01:06:19.962
How is risking your life
gonna help Bo?

01:06:29.938 --> 01:06:32.608
This is what they're writing
about me down there.

01:06:32.641 --> 01:06:34.977
They're making me out to be
some kind of jezebel.

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:36.445
Two reporters called to ask

01:06:36.478 --> 01:06:38.814
about my ex-husbands
and about you.

01:06:39.948 --> 01:06:41.550
Mr. Huff was right.

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:43.652
I'm on trial like the people
who killed Bo.

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:46.588
Jurors will be watching me,
and reading these stories

01:06:46.622 --> 01:06:49.392
when they decide if the men
who murdered my son go free.

01:06:49.425 --> 01:06:51.794
I have to protect my image

01:06:52.896 --> 01:06:55.064
if it can help get justice
for Bo.

01:06:58.735 --> 01:07:00.837
I should be going with you,
Mamie.

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:04.440
I need you to be there for me
in a different way right now.

01:07:09.346 --> 01:07:10.580
You're not gonna change
your mind?

01:07:13.082 --> 01:07:13.950
You know me well enough

01:07:13.983 --> 01:07:16.052
to answer that question
for yourself.

01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:44.281
<i>Not since</i>
<i>the Tallahatchie River flooded</i>

01:07:44.316 --> 01:07:45.749
<i>some 20 or 30 years ago</i>

01:07:45.783 --> 01:07:49.820
<i>that the townspeople had more</i>
<i>to talk about than this trial.</i>

01:07:49.853 --> 01:07:53.857
<i>I can't understand</i>
<i>how a civilized mother</i>

01:07:53.891 --> 01:07:58.829
<i>could put a dead body of</i>
<i>her child on public display!</i>

01:07:58.862 --> 01:08:03.200
<i>I think that this is</i>
<i>a result of the NAACP</i>

01:08:03.233 --> 01:08:04.835
<i>trying to make</i>
<i>something big...</i>

01:08:04.868 --> 01:08:06.770
<i>...out of just an ordinary</i>

01:08:06.804 --> 01:08:09.139
<i>criminal affair</i>
<i>in Mississippi.</i>

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:20.185
You're not going.

01:08:21.152 --> 01:08:22.886
Mamie, it's too dangerous

01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:24.889
for you to go down
to Mississippi right now.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:27.826
I heard the sheriffs
are passing along

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:29.861
Negro license plate numbers
to the Klan members.

01:08:29.894 --> 01:08:32.596
Mr. Huff and Mr. Mooty
already have plans

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.300
for me to safely travel.

01:08:34.332 --> 01:08:36.234
I'll fly to Memphis first.

01:08:36.267 --> 01:08:38.470
And then,
some people from the NAACP

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:40.138
are going to drive me
to Clarksdale.

01:08:40.171 --> 01:08:42.841
And then, their field
secretary will pick me up

01:08:42.874 --> 01:08:44.876
and drive me
to someone's house

01:08:44.908 --> 01:08:46.544
in a place called Mound Bayou.

01:08:46.578 --> 01:08:48.513
You want to go alone?

01:08:48.546 --> 01:08:51.417
I'm trying to be strong
for Bo.

01:08:51.451 --> 01:08:53.285
What are you gonna do
down there?

01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:55.955
Something you can't.

01:09:02.028 --> 01:09:05.698
If my testimony can help
in any way,

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:07.566
I have to go.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.170
I have to be there
for my child.

01:09:13.372 --> 01:09:15.107
And what about my child?

01:09:23.282 --> 01:09:24.550
I'm goin' with ya.

01:09:26.852 --> 01:09:29.087
I know this is not
what we agreed on,

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:31.591
but it's better for me
to go down there with her

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:33.225
than for her
to be there alone.

01:09:38.765 --> 01:09:41.734
You don't have to worry.
I'mma be there with you.

01:09:42.935 --> 01:09:43.937
I promise.

01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:48.341
I don't only need you
when I'm broken, Daddy.

01:09:56.249 --> 01:09:58.919
I am goin' with you.

01:10:01.254 --> 01:10:02.255

01:10:04.691 --> 01:10:06.960
Mama,

01:10:06.993 --> 01:10:07.994
No.

01:10:11.299 --> 01:10:12.867

Those pictures of your son

My wife,
she's here with our son.

01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:24.935
And we're both helping
with some of

01:12:24.969 --> 01:12:26.937
the investigation work
for the trial.

01:12:28.739 --> 01:12:30.040
Now, I promise you...

01:12:32.109 --> 01:12:33.345
we are doing everything we can

01:12:33.378 --> 01:12:35.513
to get some sort of justice
for Emmett Till.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.863
We call Dr. Howard's house
"The Black Command Center."

01:12:52.896 --> 01:12:54.566

- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:13:10.683 --> 01:13:12.050

uh, Ms. Murdock.

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:14.019
Ms. Bradley.

01:13:14.052 --> 01:13:15.854
Ms. Turner. Mr. Booker.

01:13:15.887 --> 01:13:17.956
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

01:13:17.989 --> 01:13:19.692
This here
is my son, Darrell.

01:13:19.725 --> 01:13:21.226
And my wife, Myrlie.

01:13:21.259 --> 01:13:24.029
It's an honor to meet you,
Mrs. Bradley.

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:25.464
Mr. Carthan.

01:13:27.466 --> 01:13:28.434
Hey, you don't mind?

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.269
Over here is Amzie Moore.

01:13:31.304 --> 01:13:32.305
He's the president

01:13:32.338 --> 01:13:34.774
of the Regional Council
for Negro Leadership.

01:13:34.806 --> 01:13:37.743
And I am Dr. Theodore Howard.

01:13:37.777 --> 01:13:41.315
Welcome to Mound Bayou,
Mrs. Bradley.

01:13:42.783 --> 01:13:45.017
- Mr. Carthan.
- Sir.

01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:49.088
Let me just say that
we are so...

01:13:50.256 --> 01:13:52.858
honored to have you
here with us.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.795
Thank you.

01:13:54.827 --> 01:13:56.028
Thank you.

01:13:57.597 --> 01:13:59.832
Now, what are you drinking?

01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:04.538
Not a lot of people
would use

01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:06.406
their money the way you do.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.308
Well, we need money

01:14:08.342 --> 01:14:11.077
for the freedom fight
that we're in now.

01:14:12.446 --> 01:14:13.547
We need money...

01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:17.883
to protect Negroes who are...

01:14:18.618 --> 01:14:20.053
simply trying to exercise

01:14:20.087 --> 01:14:21.988
their constitutional right
to vote,

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:24.826
to speak at trial.

01:14:28.161 --> 01:14:30.931
I had a really good life
in Chicago

01:14:30.964 --> 01:14:32.567
before they took Bo from me.

01:14:35.102 --> 01:14:36.637
I never thought much
about the world

01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:38.539
outside of just me and Bo,

01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:41.975
my job, my family, my friends.

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:48.081
Mrs. Bradley,
have you thought about, um,

01:14:48.115 --> 01:14:49.883
what you're going to do
after the trial?

01:14:51.519 --> 01:14:53.053
After the trial?

01:14:53.086 --> 01:14:54.822
I'm sure you've considered

01:14:54.856 --> 01:14:57.090
continuing your work
with the NAACP.

01:14:57.124 --> 01:15:00.060
Or with our Regional Council,
right here.

01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:04.566
Your story... speaks
to the urgency of Negro rights

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.537
more than anything
this country has ever heard.

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.971
I've been sharing my story

01:15:10.004 --> 01:15:14.443
because I want those two men
to pay for what they did.

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.177
And I do too.

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.815
But I do not believe
that justice will be rendered

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:23.485
by 12 jurors
who look exactly like

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:27.255
the two so-called men
who are on trial.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:34.061
And our fight, and your story,

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:41.403
must continue and will not end
with one single verdict.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.645
Mrs. Bradley.

01:17:02.953 --> 01:17:04.322
That's the mother!

01:17:05.022 --> 01:17:06.424
Come on, get out the way.

01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:08.560
Mrs. Bradley,
why are you here?

01:17:08.593 --> 01:17:10.194
- Ms. Bradley.
- Ms. Bradley!

01:17:10.227 --> 01:17:11.563
Come on,
say something!

01:17:11.596 --> 01:17:13.163
- Will you testify?
- Come on!

01:17:13.197 --> 01:17:14.399
- You gotta give us something.
- Mrs. Bradley.

01:17:14.432 --> 01:17:15.667
Mamie?

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.635
It's all right, Daddy.

01:17:19.471 --> 01:17:21.306
I am here to confirm...

01:17:24.809 --> 01:17:27.379
What's wrong with you?

01:17:28.112 --> 01:17:29.581
Let's get inside.
Come on.

01:17:42.427 --> 01:17:43.428
No.

01:17:57.643 --> 01:17:59.077
How dare you?

01:18:04.115 --> 01:18:05.384
It's all right, Mamie.

01:18:16.329 --> 01:18:17.330
Go on!

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:38.250
Amzie.

01:18:42.188 --> 01:18:44.925
Mrs. Bradley, I'd like you
to meet Ruby Hurley.

01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:46.426
She's also a part of our team.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.996
It's truly an honor
to meet you, Mrs. Bradley.

01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:51.263
Thank you.

01:18:51.297 --> 01:18:52.666
Thank you,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

01:18:52.699 --> 01:18:53.700
My pleasure.

01:18:53.734 --> 01:18:55.102
- We'll be with you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

01:18:55.134 --> 01:18:56.302
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

01:18:56.336 --> 01:18:58.237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, of course.

01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:02.676
Hello, niggers!

01:19:03.977 --> 01:19:06.013
I got about eight seats
down there

01:19:06.046 --> 01:19:07.882
for you
and your nigger reporters.

01:19:08.683 --> 01:19:09.817
Rest of you can stand.

01:19:10.818 --> 01:19:11.753
You Mamie?

01:19:14.722 --> 01:19:15.923
What's this?

01:19:15.957 --> 01:19:18.291
That's a damn summons.

01:19:18.326 --> 01:19:20.928
I thought you uppity niggers
could read.

01:19:20.962 --> 01:19:23.731
Mamie?
Don't let him get to you.

01:19:23.765 --> 01:19:24.732
Come on, now.

01:19:25.767 --> 01:19:27.468
Ah, there's James Hicks.

01:19:27.502 --> 01:19:29.671
We can go and sit with him
and the other reporters.

01:19:30.772 --> 01:19:32.840
Have you spoke
with the prosecution team?

01:19:32.874 --> 01:19:35.076
Only once before,
on the phone.

01:19:35.109 --> 01:19:36.477
It was brief.

01:19:36.511 --> 01:19:39.113
Hopefully, this won't take
too long. Get together later.

01:19:39.147 --> 01:19:41.015
- Mr. Smith.
- Yes.

01:19:41.049 --> 01:19:42.684
Mrs. Bradley.

01:19:42.717 --> 01:19:43.651
Mamie.

01:19:49.058 --> 01:19:50.325
- Hmm.
- Come on.

01:19:52.861 --> 01:19:54.563
All rise!

01:19:54.596 --> 01:19:58.434
The Honorable Judge
Curtis Swango presiding.

01:20:00.936 --> 01:20:01.970
Please be seated.

01:20:05.941 --> 01:20:07.275
There will be
no pictures taken

01:20:07.309 --> 01:20:09.378
during court proceedings.

01:20:09.411 --> 01:20:14.516
Bailiff, have the jurors
come in and take a seat.

01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:19.253
Also, get me a Coke sometime.
All right?

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.109
Your Honor,
the State has just learned

01:20:39.142 --> 01:20:41.276
of the existence
of another witness

01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:43.278
to the murder of Emmett Till.

01:20:43.313 --> 01:20:45.181
The State requests a recess

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:46.983
in order to gather
the witness.

01:20:48.384 --> 01:20:49.719
Objection, Your Honor!

01:20:49.753 --> 01:20:52.956
Your Honor, this will only
delay proceedings. Come on.

01:20:52.989 --> 01:20:54.724
Hmm.

01:20:54.758 --> 01:20:56.025
Objection overruled.

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:58.695
It seems like
a reasonable request.

01:20:59.496 --> 01:21:01.296
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:21:01.331 --> 01:21:02.866
I'll give you
till tomorrow morning

01:21:02.899 --> 01:21:05.034
to find your witness.

01:21:09.539 --> 01:21:11.642
The court will have a recess.

01:21:11.675 --> 01:21:15.212
We will resume at 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

01:21:16.947 --> 01:21:18.349
Court dismissed!

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:28.793
Medgar,
take me to Money.

01:21:31.228 --> 01:21:33.664
All right. Okay.

01:22:26.685 --> 01:22:28.553
That's where
it happened?

01:22:30.889 --> 01:22:31.923
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:33.559 --> 01:22:36.929
The shop's been closed
since the day of the arrest.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.869
Most of the patrons
were Negroes.

01:25:35.578 --> 01:25:38.281
Your mama tells me
you're all moving up north

01:25:38.314 --> 01:25:39.215
after the trial.

01:25:40.884 --> 01:25:43.186
Daddy says
it's not gonna be safe.

01:25:51.628 --> 01:25:53.163
Thank you.

01:26:01.305 --> 01:26:02.640
We're sorry, ma'am.

01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:09.013
We're so sorry.

01:26:13.984 --> 01:26:16.854
You all didn't know
this was going to happen.

01:26:19.623 --> 01:26:20.891
Come here.

01:26:27.998 --> 01:26:29.166
It's okay.

01:26:30.569 --> 01:26:31.836
Hmm.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:42.881
Where's your daddy?

01:27:10.175 --> 01:27:11.176
You gonna sit?

01:27:15.581 --> 01:27:16.982
I saw your boys.

01:27:20.018 --> 01:27:22.121
Was probably hard for them
to see you.

01:27:28.194 --> 01:27:29.195
You gonna sit?

01:27:41.707 --> 01:27:43.809
Did you have a shotgun
in your house

01:27:43.843 --> 01:27:45.077
the night they took Bo?

01:27:48.348 --> 01:27:52.653
I've been wanting to explain
to you what happened.

01:27:52.685 --> 01:27:54.253
You told me that part.

01:27:54.287 --> 01:27:55.855
White men came knocking

01:27:55.888 --> 01:27:57.391
-on my door, Mamie.
-I know that part.

01:27:57.424 --> 01:27:58.358
They had a gun.

01:27:58.392 --> 01:28:00.026
You have a gun!

01:28:03.163 --> 01:28:06.601
How long did you
stand there doing nothing

01:28:06.634 --> 01:28:08.336
while they took my child?

01:28:08.369 --> 01:28:09.169
If I'd have shot them,

01:28:09.203 --> 01:28:11.939
they would've killed
all of mine!

01:28:11.972 --> 01:28:14.975
It'd be hunting season
for every Negro in Money!

01:28:18.446 --> 01:28:19.913
We have to live here, Mamie.

01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:23.050
Bobo was with my boys

01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:25.018
when he went to talk
to some White woman.

01:28:25.052 --> 01:28:26.454
You understand
what that mean down here?

01:28:26.487 --> 01:28:29.289
Don't you dare blame Bo
for what happened to him!

01:28:29.324 --> 01:28:31.858
I don't blame him!

01:28:42.903 --> 01:28:44.906
I had to make a choice
that night.

01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:48.009
In a moment, I had to choose.

01:28:50.446 --> 01:28:52.880
And you chose yours over mine.

01:28:52.914 --> 01:28:57.051
It wasn't just two White men
with a gun that night.

01:28:58.354 --> 01:29:02.123
It was every White man
who'd rather see a Negro dead

01:29:02.156 --> 01:29:04.859
than breathin'
the same air as him.

01:29:04.892 --> 01:29:07.795
Every sheriff,
every judge in this town

01:29:07.829 --> 01:29:10.031
was at my door that night.

01:29:10.064 --> 01:29:14.370
I was facin' a lot more
than two men with a gun.

01:29:25.147 --> 01:29:27.350
He was my only child.

01:29:38.728 --> 01:29:39.928
I know.

01:29:57.279 --> 01:29:59.449
That's why you're moving
after the trial...

01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:03.319
because you're going
to testify?

01:30:07.223 --> 01:30:11.261
No Negro in Money has ever
spoken against a White man...

01:30:13.296 --> 01:30:14.498
and lived.

01:30:56.675 --> 01:30:57.809
That's the house.

01:30:57.843 --> 01:31:00.044
If he runs,
make sure he doesn't get away.

01:31:00.077 --> 01:31:01.480
Amzie, right here.

01:31:10.287 --> 01:31:11.556
Hey! Not so loud.

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:12.657
You'll scare him off.

01:31:16.795 --> 01:31:18.195
We told you
to leave Willie alone.

01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:20.064
Let's have
a conversation inside.

01:31:20.097 --> 01:31:21.867
He didn't see nothin'!

01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:24.135
Come out or we're comin' in.

01:31:24.168 --> 01:31:26.137
You gonna get the boy killed.

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.977
Hey! Hey!

01:31:36.883 --> 01:31:38.150
Come on, come on!

01:32:08.146 --> 01:32:09.248
We need
to keep him here

01:32:09.282 --> 01:32:10.818
just in case
he runs off again.

01:32:10.851 --> 01:32:13.186
I ain't gonna run.

01:32:13.219 --> 01:32:15.389
I'll tell 'em
what I saw that night.

01:32:15.422 --> 01:32:17.357
And what about
your grandparents?

01:32:18.157 --> 01:32:19.192
Would you say that they heard

01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:20.594
some sounds
comin' out the barn too?

01:32:20.627 --> 01:32:23.831
No, no, I promised them I was
gonna keep them out of it.

01:32:23.864 --> 01:32:25.332
We're gonna finance security

01:32:25.365 --> 01:32:27.734
for your entire family
after they testify,

01:32:27.768 --> 01:32:29.235
so don't you worry none, son.

01:32:30.471 --> 01:32:31.472
All right?

01:32:32.406 --> 01:32:34.307
<i>His name is Willie Reed,</i>

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:36.577
<i>a field hand for</i>
<i>J.W.'s brother.</i>

01:32:37.778 --> 01:32:39.680
He's a witness
who lives on the farm

01:32:39.713 --> 01:32:41.515
not too far from where he saw

01:32:41.548 --> 01:32:43.383
J.W. and Roy Bryant

01:32:43.417 --> 01:32:45.586
and several other men
take Emmett.

01:32:45.619 --> 01:32:48.489
Now, Willie's family
also works for the Milams,

01:32:48.522 --> 01:32:51.058
so they also heard
a lot of noise that night.

01:32:51.091 --> 01:32:53.060
There were other men?

01:32:54.929 --> 01:32:57.297
It pains me
to have to tell you this,

01:32:57.332 --> 01:33:00.568
but there were some colored
men that were involved.

01:33:03.972 --> 01:33:06.341
Colored men did this
to my boy?

01:33:06.374 --> 01:33:08.208
Well, they work
for Milam and Bryant,

01:33:08.242 --> 01:33:10.678
and found out Bryant
had 'em paid to skip town.

01:33:11.613 --> 01:33:12.614
What...

01:33:16.818 --> 01:33:19.319
I can fix that for you.

01:33:27.562 --> 01:33:30.565
It means a lot,

01:33:32.033 --> 01:33:33.335
what you're doing.

01:33:38.139 --> 01:33:39.542
Thank you.

01:33:42.511 --> 01:33:43.646
Thank you.

01:33:44.747 --> 01:33:46.080
It's the right thing to do.

01:33:56.124 --> 01:33:57.693
Go ahead
and put these on.

01:34:28.658 --> 01:34:31.061
It's difficult for me
to fall asleep

01:34:31.093 --> 01:34:32.629
before Medgar gets home.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.801
I've wanted to meet you.

01:34:39.168 --> 01:34:41.303
What you did
with those photographs...

01:34:41.338 --> 01:34:44.474
What you're doin' now,
it's, um...

01:34:44.507 --> 01:34:47.209
It's nothing a mother
wouldn't do for her child.

01:34:49.746 --> 01:34:50.747
Hmm.

01:34:52.082 --> 01:34:53.684
How old's your son?

01:34:53.718 --> 01:34:56.319
Two.

01:34:58.522 --> 01:35:00.190
We almost didn't take him
and his sister

01:35:00.223 --> 01:35:02.158
with us from Jackson, but I...

01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:05.096
I'm trying to keep
the family together

01:35:05.128 --> 01:35:06.831
as much as possible
these days.

01:35:10.468 --> 01:35:12.103
I'm sure you heard
about what happened

01:35:12.135 --> 01:35:14.204
to our friends Lamar Smith
and Reverend Lee.

01:35:14.237 --> 01:35:16.440
Yes, I have.

01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:19.410
Medgar and I worked closely
with 'em.

01:35:20.878 --> 01:35:23.080
We did good work.

01:35:23.114 --> 01:35:24.515
We got a lot of Negroes
registered to vote

01:35:24.548 --> 01:35:26.617
for the first time
in Mississippi,

01:35:27.918 --> 01:35:30.888
and that created the biggest
targets on our backs.

01:35:40.365 --> 01:35:42.901
I, um...

01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:49.240
I believe in the work
we're doin' for our people.

01:35:50.142 --> 01:35:51.376
I do.

01:35:54.346 --> 01:35:56.715
But I don't want my children
to have to live in fear.

01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:00.118
I have enough fear
for all of us

01:36:00.152 --> 01:36:02.186
every time I wait for Medgar
to get home.

01:36:06.992 --> 01:36:08.560
Emmett just wanted
to go on vacation

01:36:08.593 --> 01:36:10.696
and have fun with his cousins.

01:36:12.531 --> 01:36:15.266
He never thought
anything would happen to him.

01:36:16.369 --> 01:36:22.307
He knew how different
things were down here,

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:26.879
but I never raised him
to have any fear growing up.

01:36:29.214 --> 01:36:31.818
I wanted him to be a boy.

01:36:31.851 --> 01:36:34.787
And to not have his childhood
taken away from him.

01:36:37.824 --> 01:36:39.592
But it happened anyway.

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:04.317
We do the best we can.

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:34.948
Do you know Mr. Bryant?

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.655
He owns
the meat market.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:41.623
Hmm.

01:37:41.656 --> 01:37:43.992
Then you know Mr. Milam,
do ya?

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:48.363
Not by name.

01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:51.733
But I know him.

01:37:51.766 --> 01:37:52.934
How do you know him?

01:37:55.570 --> 01:37:57.405
He showed up
at my door,

01:37:58.807 --> 01:38:00.909
standing there
with a flashlight in one hand

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:02.343
and a pistol in the other.

01:38:04.512 --> 01:38:06.313
And what happened next?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.870
He held my family at gunpoint.

01:38:30.172 --> 01:38:33.409
Then he dragged my nephew
from my home and drove off.

01:38:33.442 --> 01:38:35.144
Sambo!

01:38:38.047 --> 01:38:40.983
And would you

01:38:41.016 --> 01:38:45.588
Would you recognize Mr. Milam
were you to see him again?

01:38:57.066 --> 01:38:58.067
Yes, sir.

01:39:01.938 --> 01:39:03.573
I would.

01:39:15.886 --> 01:39:17.320
There he is.

01:39:22.626 --> 01:39:24.362
The State rests.

01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:28.498
The witness
can leave now.

01:39:30.433 --> 01:39:32.168
The court will have a recess.

01:39:59.096 --> 01:40:00.598
What did you think you heard?

01:40:03.801 --> 01:40:06.837
I heard loud hollering
and licks

01:40:08.039 --> 01:40:09.140
comin' from that shed.

01:40:10.441 --> 01:40:11.742
Sounded like a boy.

01:40:13.511 --> 01:40:14.712
I saw, uh...

01:40:17.281 --> 01:40:18.549
J.W. Milam.

01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:22.721
Saw a green truck
with a white top.

01:40:25.257 --> 01:40:26.458
As they drove off,

01:40:26.491 --> 01:40:30.195
there was, uh.
two White men in the cab

01:40:30.228 --> 01:40:31.930
and three colored men
in the back.

01:40:33.532 --> 01:40:35.435
They was all sitting
next to a body.

01:40:35.467 --> 01:40:37.169
Are you sure
that's what you heard?

01:40:37.202 --> 01:40:38.337
Yes, sir.

01:40:38.371 --> 01:40:40.172
Huh. If that's what you heard,

01:40:40.205 --> 01:40:43.475
why not yell out,
or call "Help"?

01:40:47.546 --> 01:40:48.747
I...

01:40:52.017 --> 01:40:53.386
I...

01:40:53.419 --> 01:40:54.619
I couldn't.

01:40:55.554 --> 01:40:56.922
No further questions.

01:41:08.534 --> 01:41:09.736
You can leave now.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.922
Did you certify
that the body found

01:41:29.956 --> 01:41:31.290
was Emmett Till?

01:41:31.324 --> 01:41:32.892
No, I did not.

01:41:32.925 --> 01:41:35.328
I just said
it was a dead body.

01:41:35.362 --> 01:41:38.798
You couldn't even tell if
the body was White or Black.

01:41:38.831 --> 01:41:40.166
Thank you, Sheriff Strider.

01:41:40.199 --> 01:41:41.567
You are excused.

01:41:44.772 --> 01:41:46.006
You want my honest opinion?

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.542
I think the boy's mammy
and the NAACP

01:41:48.575 --> 01:41:51.111
plotted this whole thing.

01:41:51.145 --> 01:41:52.946
Thank you, Sheriff Strider.

01:41:54.548 --> 01:41:56.283
That boy's
still alive somewhere.

01:42:38.427 --> 01:42:39.694
Mamie...

01:42:42.565 --> 01:42:44.533
Did you have a son who,
in his lifetime,

01:42:44.567 --> 01:42:46.668
was known as Emmett Till?

01:42:48.136 --> 01:42:49.337
Yes, sir.

01:42:49.371 --> 01:42:51.206
How old was he?

01:42:51.239 --> 01:42:53.141
Fourteen years of age.

01:42:53.174 --> 01:42:55.043
Is his father
living today?

01:42:55.578 --> 01:42:56.744
No, sir.

01:42:56.778 --> 01:42:59.047
He died in service.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.748
Oh.
Uh, when your husband,

01:43:00.782 --> 01:43:03.385
the father of Emmett Till,
was killed overseas,

01:43:03.419 --> 01:43:05.954
were his belongings
sent to you?

01:43:05.987 --> 01:43:07.056
Yes, sir.

01:43:08.657 --> 01:43:10.192
I now hand you

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:14.431
a ring
that has engraved on it,

01:43:14.464 --> 01:43:18.602
May 25th, 1943,

01:43:18.634 --> 01:43:20.102
with the large initials L.T.

01:43:20.136 --> 01:43:22.338
Was that among the items
that were sent to you?

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:24.273
Yes, sir.

01:43:25.442 --> 01:43:26.642
And is that the ring

01:43:26.675 --> 01:43:29.111
that Emmett came down here
to Mississippi with?

01:43:30.112 --> 01:43:31.180
Yes, sir.

01:43:32.748 --> 01:43:36.785
Mamie, I wish
you would state to the court,

01:43:37.487 --> 01:43:38.854
and to the jury,

01:43:38.888 --> 01:43:41.190
whether you could identify
the body

01:43:41.223 --> 01:43:43.926
that you saw down there
in the funeral home

01:43:43.959 --> 01:43:46.228
as that of your son,
Emmett Till.

01:43:47.464 --> 01:43:48.732
I could.

01:43:55.573 --> 01:43:58.909
It's hard to describe
what a mother knows.

01:44:00.744 --> 01:44:01.978
Please.

01:44:08.285 --> 01:44:11.355
The first thing I noticed
when I became a mother

01:44:12.022 --> 01:44:14.458
was that my hands were busy.

01:44:14.492 --> 01:44:16.726
All the time.

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.431
Rocking, carrying, swaying,
always full.

01:44:20.864 --> 01:44:22.533
One hand for him,

01:44:22.567 --> 01:44:24.768
and one hand
for what he needed.

01:44:26.036 --> 01:44:28.171
When it came time
to place him down

01:44:28.205 --> 01:44:30.442
so he could make
his own way around,

01:44:31.577 --> 01:44:33.445
I touched every inch of him.

01:44:34.145 --> 01:44:36.214
Every bend.

01:44:36.247 --> 01:44:40.419
My hand knew him
with my eyes closed.

01:44:40.452 --> 01:44:41.719
Just like I'd know
his laughter

01:44:41.752 --> 01:44:43.221
in a crowded room.

01:44:44.356 --> 01:44:48.159
It's the same thing
when you know all of someone.

01:45:00.871 --> 01:45:04.809
I started by laying my hands
on a foot.

01:45:06.478 --> 01:45:07.979
And then

01:45:09.146 --> 01:45:10.782
found his knees.

01:45:12.985 --> 01:45:15.087
I remembered him...

01:45:16.989 --> 01:45:20.993
as my fingers
traced his hairline,

01:45:22.227 --> 01:45:26.432
and bumped over the crease
of his eyelid.

01:45:28.767 --> 01:45:31.270
He was spoiled and puffed,

01:45:32.505 --> 01:45:33.939
but these were the same parts

01:45:33.972 --> 01:45:36.108
of a boy I'd nurtured
and loved.

01:45:37.142 --> 01:45:40.012
Nothing and no one
could hide him from me.

01:45:42.281 --> 01:45:43.849
A mother knows.

01:45:45.317 --> 01:45:47.019
Your mother would know.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:48.954
And I knew.

01:45:48.987 --> 01:45:54.060
I knew this was my boy.
Emmett Till.

01:45:54.728 --> 01:45:56.363
Beyond any doubt.

01:45:59.132 --> 01:46:01.100
Thank you. Uh...

01:46:02.603 --> 01:46:05.038
Thank you, Mrs. Bradley.

01:46:05.071 --> 01:46:07.907
I believe that's all any of us
would ever need to hear.

01:46:12.513 --> 01:46:13.614
Mamie?

01:46:13.647 --> 01:46:14.682
Do you happen to remember

01:46:14.715 --> 01:46:16.684
the date
Emmett Till's father died?

01:46:16.717 --> 01:46:20.219
Yes, sir.
July the 2nd, 1945.

01:46:20.253 --> 01:46:21.722
Where was he
when he died?

01:46:21.755 --> 01:46:23.089
In Europe.

01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:26.826
Did you have an insurance
policy on Emmett Till?

01:46:27.594 --> 01:46:28.762
Um...

01:46:28.796 --> 01:46:30.531
Yes, sir.

01:46:30.564 --> 01:46:32.701
How much was it for?

01:46:32.734 --> 01:46:35.969
I had a 10-cent
and 15-cent policy,

01:46:36.003 --> 01:46:39.106
two weekly policies,
and they equaled $400.

01:46:39.139 --> 01:46:41.208
$400?

01:46:42.711 --> 01:46:44.479
Now, to whom
were those policies payable?

01:46:44.512 --> 01:46:47.081
Uh,
we object to that, Your Honor.

01:46:47.114 --> 01:46:48.750
Objection overruled.

01:46:48.783 --> 01:46:50.951
The witness
will answer the question.

01:46:52.019 --> 01:46:54.088
I was the beneficiary on one,

01:46:54.121 --> 01:46:55.989
and my mother
was on the other.

01:46:57.057 --> 01:46:58.092
He ever cause

01:46:58.125 --> 01:46:59.860
or get in any trouble
in Chicago?

01:47:00.695 --> 01:47:01.796
No more than any other boy.

01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:03.263
Did he attend
a reform school?

01:47:03.297 --> 01:47:04.532
What for?

01:47:04.566 --> 01:47:05.567
No.

01:47:06.934 --> 01:47:09.236
You've been quoted
in the colored press,

01:47:09.269 --> 01:47:11.972
"I told him several times
before he left for Mississippi

01:47:12.005 --> 01:47:13.409
"that he should kneel
in the street

01:47:13.442 --> 01:47:14.744
"and beg for forgiveness

01:47:14.777 --> 01:47:16.579
"should he ever insult
a White person."

01:47:16.612 --> 01:47:18.714
Not those exact words.

01:47:18.748 --> 01:47:21.182
Did you caution
him not to insult White women?

01:47:21.216 --> 01:47:24.119
I referred to White people
in general.

01:47:24.152 --> 01:47:25.821
Did you caution your son

01:47:25.855 --> 01:47:27.255
how to conduct himself
and behave himself

01:47:27.288 --> 01:47:28.557
while he was down here
in Mississippi?

01:47:28.591 --> 01:47:29.525
Several times.

01:47:29.558 --> 01:47:32.093
Several times!
Do tell us how.

01:47:32.127 --> 01:47:34.028
I will give you
a literal description

01:47:34.062 --> 01:47:35.398
of what I told him.

01:47:35.431 --> 01:47:36.632
How coming down here,

01:47:36.665 --> 01:47:39.934
he would have to adapt himself
to a different way of life.

01:47:39.968 --> 01:47:42.036
Be very careful
about how he spoke,

01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:43.472
and to whom he spoke,

01:47:43.506 --> 01:47:47.175
and to always remember to say,
"Yes, sir" and "No, ma'am."

01:47:47.208 --> 01:47:49.678
I told him that if ever
an incident should arise

01:47:49.712 --> 01:47:51.045
where there would be
any trouble

01:47:51.079 --> 01:47:52.548
of any kind with White people,

01:47:52.581 --> 01:47:54.684
that if it got to the point
where he needed

01:47:54.718 --> 01:47:56.486
to go down on his knees
before them,

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:59.890
well, I told him
not to hesitate to do so.

01:47:59.922 --> 01:48:03.058
Like if he bumped
into somebody on the street

01:48:03.092 --> 01:48:05.362
and they might get belligerent
or something.

01:48:05.395 --> 01:48:08.197
Well, I told him to go ahead
and humble himself

01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:11.435
so as not to get into
any trouble! But...

01:48:12.502 --> 01:48:13.637
But what?

01:48:14.871 --> 01:48:18.375
Well, I raised him with love
for 14 years.

01:48:18.408 --> 01:48:22.344
My sudden warnings about hate
weren't going to get through.

01:48:23.547 --> 01:48:25.080
I now show you
what purports to be

01:48:25.114 --> 01:48:26.650
a photograph of your son.

01:48:29.386 --> 01:48:33.790
This was taken in my home
two days after Christmas.

01:48:33.824 --> 01:48:36.394
Now, tell the court
and the jury what this is.

01:48:38.362 --> 01:48:41.632
This picture is of my son

01:48:41.666 --> 01:48:45.670
after Mississippi sent him
back to Chicago, dead.

01:48:49.206 --> 01:48:50.608
No further questions.

01:48:52.376 --> 01:48:54.177
And for the prosecution?

01:48:55.813 --> 01:48:57.180
State rests.

01:48:59.484 --> 01:49:01.084
Court will have
a recess.

01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:08.291
They...

01:49:08.325 --> 01:49:11.294
They killed my son again.

01:49:19.805 --> 01:49:21.105
Hmm.

01:50:02.214 --> 01:50:04.717
Will the jury please
retire to the jury room?

01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:10.490
The testimony
being offered here today

01:50:10.523 --> 01:50:13.626
of a prior incident
at the store in Money

01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:14.827
is irrelevant.

01:50:15.995 --> 01:50:17.162
Your Honor,

01:50:17.195 --> 01:50:19.933
may we still continue
the testimony

01:50:19.966 --> 01:50:22.134
on account of the record?

01:50:22.167 --> 01:50:23.603
Uh, Your Honor...

01:50:23.636 --> 01:50:25.137
Sit down.

01:50:26.071 --> 01:50:28.908
Now, I see no harm
in letting Ms. Bryant

01:50:28.942 --> 01:50:32.277
share her side of things
if she wants to.

01:50:32.311 --> 01:50:34.514
Hell, everybody else has.

01:50:34.547 --> 01:50:36.549
You think
you can handle that, dear?

01:50:44.925 --> 01:50:46.360
Mrs. Bryant,

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.295
was anyone in the store
with you

01:50:49.329 --> 01:50:53.801
on Wednesday night,
24th day of August, 1955?

01:50:56.036 --> 01:50:57.438
I was alone.

01:50:58.539 --> 01:51:01.107
But the children
were in the back.

01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:02.743
In the living quarters.

01:51:04.044 --> 01:51:06.447
And what time of day was it?

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:07.681
After dark.

01:51:09.083 --> 01:51:10.116
Alone.

01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:12.352
At nighttime
with your children.

01:51:12.386 --> 01:51:14.888
Well, you just tell the court
what happened next.

01:51:17.156 --> 01:51:19.893
This nigger man
came into the store

01:51:19.927 --> 01:51:22.262
and stood by the candy case.

01:51:23.031 --> 01:51:24.633
And you?

01:51:24.666 --> 01:51:27.267
I was
behind the counter.

01:51:27.301 --> 01:51:30.105
I asked the man
what he wanted.

01:51:30.137 --> 01:51:32.641
And then did you get him
the merchandise?

01:51:32.674 --> 01:51:33.675
Yes.

01:51:35.275 --> 01:51:38.113
And then what did you do?

01:51:38.145 --> 01:51:40.482
I held out my hand
for the money.

01:51:41.683 --> 01:51:43.350
Will you show the court

01:51:43.385 --> 01:51:44.853
how you held your hand out?

01:51:46.688 --> 01:51:47.722
Like this.

01:51:47.756 --> 01:51:50.190
And did he give you
the money?

01:51:50.224 --> 01:51:52.360
No,
he caught my hand.

01:51:53.361 --> 01:51:55.262
Will you show the court

01:51:55.295 --> 01:51:57.399
just how he grasped your hand?

01:52:01.236 --> 01:52:03.105
And was that a strong grip
or a light grip

01:52:03.139 --> 01:52:05.675
that he had
when he held your hand?

01:52:05.708 --> 01:52:07.043
A strong grip.

01:52:09.277 --> 01:52:11.781
Will you show
the court what you did?

01:52:11.814 --> 01:52:13.449
How did you get loose?

01:52:18.854 --> 01:52:21.724
I jerked it loose like this.

01:52:22.892 --> 01:52:27.195
Now, just what did he say
when he grabbed your hand?

01:52:28.931 --> 01:52:31.801
- "How about a date, baby?"
- Hmm.

01:52:33.002 --> 01:52:35.171
Now, you freed yourself.

01:52:35.203 --> 01:52:36.706
And what happened then?

01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:43.312
I turned to the back
of the store.

01:52:45.214 --> 01:52:47.316
And he went on his way?

01:52:49.453 --> 01:52:51.220
No.

01:52:51.253 --> 01:52:54.658
He came after me.

01:52:54.691 --> 01:52:57.661
He caught me down
by the cash register.

01:53:00.197 --> 01:53:04.634
Mrs. Bryant, can you
demonstrate for the court?

01:53:07.504 --> 01:53:08.371
Yes.

01:53:08.405 --> 01:53:09.706
All right, now.

01:53:17.614 --> 01:53:20.383
Grabbed your hands,
pinned them behind your back?

01:53:22.652 --> 01:53:23.955
Yes.

01:53:23.988 --> 01:53:26.958
His right hand
on your right hip?

01:53:28.426 --> 01:53:29.927
Here.

01:53:31.095 --> 01:53:32.663
Just what did he say?

01:53:34.665 --> 01:53:38.736
He said,
"You needn't be afraid of me.

01:53:38.770 --> 01:53:40.772
"I've been
with White women before."

01:53:41.739 --> 01:53:43.841
And what happened then?

01:53:43.875 --> 01:53:46.309
Then another nigger
came in the door...

01:53:48.212 --> 01:53:50.414
I'm ready to go.

01:53:50.448 --> 01:53:51.816
You want me
to come and get you

01:53:51.849 --> 01:53:52.750
when they read a verdict?

01:53:52.784 --> 01:53:56.921
No. I'm ready
to leave Mississippi. Now.

01:53:56.954 --> 01:53:58.422
What about the verdict?

01:53:59.423 --> 01:54:01.359
I know what the verdict is.

01:54:04.128 --> 01:54:06.632
<i>After deliberating</i>
<i>for about an hour,</i>

01:54:06.665 --> 01:54:09.034
<i>the jury has just come back</i>
<i>with a verdict</i>

01:54:09.067 --> 01:54:11.036
<i>of "not guilty."</i>

01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:15.007
<i>Thus the defendants Milam</i>
<i>and Bryant are free men.</i>

01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.642
<i>They celebrated their victory</i>

01:54:16.675 --> 01:54:20.279
<i>laughing and smiling with</i>
<i>their wives at their side,</i>

01:54:20.311 --> 01:54:23.048
<i>clearly happy...</i>

01:54:56.348 --> 01:55:00.720
<i>Her story</i>
<i>has changed the world.</i>

01:55:00.753 --> 01:55:04.457
<i>Because she had the courage</i>
<i>to make it not just her own,</i>

01:55:05.124 --> 01:55:06.426
<i>but all of ours.</i>

01:55:09.128 --> 01:55:12.765
<i>Mamie, it is an honor</i>
<i>to share the stage with you.</i>

01:55:14.434 --> 01:55:16.402
<i>To share this fight with you.</i>

01:55:16.436 --> 01:55:18.438
Yes, yes!

01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:23.710
<i>Please welcome</i>
<i>Mrs. Mamie Till-Bradley.</i>

01:55:28.749 --> 01:55:30.317
This is just
the beginning.

01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:44.198
<i>I would like to</i>
<i>give honor to God,</i>

01:55:44.231 --> 01:55:46.267
<i>who is the source</i>
<i>of my strength</i>

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:48.168
<i>and the reason for my being.</i>

01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:52.973
<i>I thank you,</i>
<i>Mr. Mooty and the NAACP,</i>

01:55:53.007 --> 01:55:55.976
<i>for inviting me</i>
<i>to speak before you all</i>

01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:57.778
<i>in Harlem, New York City.</i>

01:55:58.178 --> 01:55:59.780
Yes.

01:55:59.813 --> 01:56:02.783
<i>My son's brutalized body</i>
<i>meant nothing</i>

01:56:02.816 --> 01:56:05.986
<i>to Mississippi's</i>
<i>criminal justice system.</i>

01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:09.224
<i>And while they blamed</i>
<i>the victim, as usual,</i>

01:56:09.257 --> 01:56:12.627
<i>the federal government</i>
<i>stood idly by.</i>

01:56:12.661 --> 01:56:15.196
<i>If this country</i>
<i>fails to protect</i>

01:56:15.230 --> 01:56:16.865
<i>the Black body from hate,</i>

01:56:16.898 --> 01:56:19.334
<i>America has yet to meet</i>
<i>her promise.</i>

01:56:19.368 --> 01:56:20.635
Amen!

01:56:20.669 --> 01:56:24.172
<i>Either freedom for everyone,</i>
<i>or freedom fails!</i>

01:56:32.948 --> 01:56:37.018
<i>One month ago, I had</i>
<i>a nice apartment in Chicago.</i>

01:56:37.052 --> 01:56:41.656
<i>I had a good job. I had a son.</i>

01:56:41.690 --> 01:56:44.092
<i>When something happened</i>
<i>to the Negroes in the South,</i>

01:56:44.125 --> 01:56:48.129
<i>I said, "Well, that's</i>
<i>their business. Not mine."</i>

01:56:48.163 --> 01:56:51.701
<i>Now I know how wrong I was.</i>

01:56:51.734 --> 01:56:54.003
<i>The lynching of my son</i>
<i>has shown me</i>

01:56:54.036 --> 01:56:56.072
<i>that what happens</i>
<i>to any of us,</i>

01:56:56.105 --> 01:56:57.374
<i>anywhere in the world,</i>

01:56:57.407 --> 01:57:00.476
<i>had better be the business</i>
<i>of us all.</i>

01:57:15.358 --> 01:57:16.993
I hear ya, sister!

01:57:17.526 --> 01:57:18.928
That's right.

01:57:19.695 --> 01:57:21.297
Tell it like it is!

01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:22.631
I heard that!

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.534
Yes! Yes!
