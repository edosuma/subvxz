01:45.800 --> 01:47.800
Look at this.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.665
The house sang out to us
of Miami and Taormina

01:51.700 --> 01:55.300
where we had our honeymoon -
Nicole said, "Let's buy it. "

01:55.335 --> 01:58.317
Can just about smell the salt.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.300
You mean the painting or the view?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.465
Both.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.400
That's called the trumpay la oil.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.900
Fool the eye. It was done by an artist right
here in West Hempstead.

02:10.935 --> 02:13.217
I'll be damned.

02:13.252 --> 02:15.500
Follow me, Jerry.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.900
This little bitch is for you.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
It's a Whirlpool Duet, top of the line.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.900
Same as mine.
Nicole is head over heels with it.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.965
This is above and beyond, Carmine.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.200
Thank my father too,
may he rest in peace.

02:30.235 --> 02:32.965
This is for Freeport. It's a token.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.400
You know it's my understanding, Carmine,
that Johnny is still sore about that.

02:37.435 --> 02:40.600
That's why I appreciate your support.
I'm moved up here now.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.400
You and me are gonna do
great things together.

02:43.435 --> 02:44.865
Amen.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.900
Daddy, Daddy! The boat is sinking!

02:51.300 --> 02:53.100
Carmine! My God!

03:00.200 --> 03:04.700
I just sailed her up
from Miami three weeks ago. She was fine.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.300
You should call the coastguard, Carmine.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.500
Oh, shit!

03:41.300 --> 03:43.465
It's OK, take it easy.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.600
After all these years of marriage,

03:45.700 --> 03:49.200
you know what you find yourself thinking
in your private moments?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.500
Please, God, let me die first.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.500
I don't wanna miss him.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.100
He's gonna be all right.

03:58.135 --> 04:00.100
You're lucky.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.400
In some way, you've been spared that.

04:04.435 --> 04:07.700
Well, you and Tony calling it quits now.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.700
Maybe we should cancel the party.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.065
Maybe he'll be fine by his birthday.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.200
You know he's turning 75, Ma,
that's a milestone.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.500
He's got some bruising. He's very lucky.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.300
Those hedges broke his fall. But a few
days of rest and he should be fine.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.700
The neurologist is giving him a final look,
then you can take him home.

04:35.735 --> 04:39.200
- Thank you so much, Doctor.
- Thank God.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.400
His roofing days are over,
I'll tell you that right now.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.900
I guess.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.300
So, what do you think about the party?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.465
Jeez, Ma, I...

04:53.500 --> 04:55.700
I think we should go for it.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.400
Well, what do you think about inviting Tony?

05:01.500 --> 05:05.000
Well, that's the thing.
I don't know if I should or not.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.400
Everybody would understand if you didn't.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.600
- You're separated.
- I know.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.800
Just the idea of having a family party

05:11.900 --> 05:16.200
in the backyard without Tony
manning the grill, playing host...

05:16.300 --> 05:18.100
It wouldn't be the same.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.100
- It's gonna be OK, baby.
- Why don't they take care of this man?

05:26.900 --> 05:29.400
I think it's a very wise decision.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.400
What decision? I haven't made one.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.400
I thought I heard you say that you had.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.400
That he wasn't coming.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.400
Maserati.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.965
- Kind of draws attention, no?
- True.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.365
Friends of ours, most of 'em probably
wouldn't own it.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.100
It was always a dream of mine
to own a fine Italian sports car.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.965
Salute.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
And in the Guinea grey it looks fantastic.

06:00.035 --> 06:03.100
Tops out 176 miles per hour.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.400
Standing quarter in 13 and change.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.300
- How many horses?
- 390.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.200
- What'd that set you back? About...
- 99 and change.

06:13.235 --> 06:15.600
You're spending like you're on the throne.

06:15.700 --> 06:19.000
- I had a good year.
- Oh, God bless.

06:19.035 --> 06:22.300
While we're doing car talk here, Phil...

06:22.400 --> 06:24.750
Madonna, he won't let that thing go.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.100
He owed me money
and he was ducking me.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.065
I'm not saying you're wrong.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.000
Phil treats nickels like manhole covers.
Believe me, I know.

06:32.035 --> 06:34.800
The loyal captains need to know
I stand behind them.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.300
Fucking Little Carmine.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.300
This asshole's giving away
washing machines. You believe that?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.700
He don't have
collision insurance, fucking Phil?

06:44.800 --> 06:46.600
His son-in-law's a broker.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.100
They let it lapse looking for a better rate.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
Fucking idiot.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.600
Tony, I ruled in your favour.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.000
The racetrack, the money Philly owed you.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.700
If I'm paying for it,
we do it at Pussy's or not at all.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.400
His wife's running the body shop now.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.900
I can at least control expenses.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.900
Thanks.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.500
Come on. Get in. I'll take you for a ride.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.700
Fucking thing's so powerful,
I had to take a lesson from the dealer.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.900
It's pretty low.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.900
- How's Ginny like the car?
- She loves it.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
She hasn't driven with me. With her knee,
she has a little trouble getting into the seat.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.650
Tony, hi.

08:08.685 --> 08:10.465
Hey, Ange.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.400
- How are ya?
- Good.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.300
A friend of mine banged up
his car pretty good

08:17.400 --> 08:19.550
so I was thinking, maybe help us both out

08:19.585 --> 08:21.700
and throw a little business your way.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
You didn't need to come. Phone me.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.300
The thing is, I gotta pay for the repairs.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.765
Long story, I distracted him
while he was driving.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.299
Anyway, the point being that anything
you can do to keep costs in line

08:34.400 --> 08:36.299
would be a big help to me.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.400
You look like you're doing pretty good since
we had that phone call

08:44.435 --> 08:47.700
where you asked me
could you take over Puss's body shop.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.600
Thank you for that, Tony.

08:49.700 --> 08:54.600
You didn't have to say yes with all the other
kind of business you do through here.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.100
His name is Phil,
and Carmela sends her love.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.200
Please say hello!

09:23.200 --> 09:26.700
Finally.
I left a message I was gonna come by.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
Well, I got in late.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.350
The girl called in sick.

09:37.385 --> 09:39.600
You should get a new one.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.700
Have a seat.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.500
May I get you anything?

09:55.900 --> 09:57.600
How's your father?

09:57.700 --> 09:59.600
Much better.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.800
Oh, thanks.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.700
He'll be fine for the party, thank God.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.800
Well, that's good.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.800
- What party?
- His 75th birthday?

10:20.900 --> 10:23.500
The surprise party
we talked about last summer?

10:23.600 --> 10:26.700
- Oh, yeah. That's coming up?
- Next Saturday.

10:29.100 --> 10:32.900
But actually that's why I wanted to come by.

10:32.935 --> 10:36.500
I think maybe it would be best...

10:36.600 --> 10:40.100
be easier anyway, for both of us, if...

10:40.135 --> 10:41.600
if I went at it alone,

10:42.300 --> 10:44.400
and not have you there.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.200
My father would love to have you there.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.200
He's crazy about your sausages
and all the rest of it, but...

10:56.300 --> 11:00.600
I thought, "Why put us and people
in an uncomfortable situation?"

11:01.500 --> 11:04.700
I decided right away
when we broke up I wasn't coming.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.300
Really?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.300
I'm so glad you understand.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.200
It was hard for me
to come to this decision, let alone tell you.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.350
Well, I'd like to contribute anyway.

11:22.385 --> 11:24.600
No, Mom and I are taking care of it.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.800
For Hugh's 75th? I insist.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.300
I would rather see you
go back to your therapist.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.000
I'd like to see you go to a therapist!
And I'm not the only one.

11:34.035 --> 11:35.700
Oh, really?

11:35.800 --> 11:37.900
You can tell them all I can't afford it.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
It's not really your business
any more whether I go or what!

12:06.700 --> 12:09.100
I brought you some Danish and coffee.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.600
Fucking medication.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.500
I can't think. I can't stay awake.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.165
It don't have that side effect.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.600
But it'll help your outlook if you'd take it
consistently like you're supposed to.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.265
What's on?

12:26.300 --> 12:28.700
It said in the guide it's an Italian movie,

12:28.800 --> 12:31.800
but even with the captions
I can't tell what's what.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.200
They had Jesus hanging off a helicopter,

12:34.235 --> 12:36.500
but you could tell it was a dummy.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.700
You know who I saw at the bakery?

12:40.800 --> 12:42.765
How the fuck could I know?

12:42.800 --> 12:47.100
Rosalie Aprile. There's a surprise party
for Carmela's father next week.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.100
He's gonna be 75. You get an invite?

12:54.100 --> 12:57.600
No, but we go way back
to when Moses wore short pants.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.400
I'd better call Hugh.
Tell him not to expect me.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.700
It's a surprise party, Jun'.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.600
What are we, children?

13:09.900 --> 13:13.600
At our age it's enough surprise
we're still alive every morning.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.400
- What cities and states, please?
- In West Orange.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.700
DeAngelis, Hugo.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.900
The call can automatically be completed
by pressing one

13:23.000 --> 13:26.900
for an additional charge of 35 cents.

13:26.935 --> 13:29.100
What the fuck? It's over anyhow.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.100
Hello?

13:38.500 --> 13:42.500
- Who is this?
- Corrado Soprano.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.500
Corrado. How are ya?

13:46.100 --> 13:49.400
How am I? I'm a prisoner in my own
home is how I am.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.400
- What do we live for?
- Yeah.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.800
Anyhow, I wanted to wish you
a buona fortuna,

13:56.900 --> 13:58.565
and also send you my regrets.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.400
- I'd love to be at your jubilee...
- Junior.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.100
- Jubilee?
- But the government

14:04.200 --> 14:06.000
says I can't leave the house,

14:06.035 --> 14:07.800
and my family keeps me sedated.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.100
Bobby told me it was a surprise party
but I told him... I go,

14:12.200 --> 14:16.800
"At our age it's enough surprise
every day when we get up in the morning. "

14:17.600 --> 14:19.265
I suppose so.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.100
So happy birthday,
my friend, and many more.

14:47.700 --> 14:52.100
To think, when I got out of the joint
they thought an air bag was Paulie Walnuts.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.065
- How'd we do this week?
- Good.

14:55.100 --> 14:59.300
The Acura dealer,
what's his name, he took 20 units.

14:59.400 --> 15:04.800
Carlo gave me the OK to make some
personnel changes at the warehouse.

15:04.835 --> 15:07.100
Your call.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.300
I don't know. The air bag thing, it earns good.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.000
It's not hard work, Christ knows, but...

15:17.700 --> 15:19.065
But what?

15:19.100 --> 15:23.700
I could be a lot more service in other areas.
And getting straightened out wouldn't hurt.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.400
Just eat what's on your plate right now.

15:28.500 --> 15:33.300
- Christ, what's it been, a month?
- I'm a team player, cousin. Charlie Hustle.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.300
If that's what you want, I'll do it.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.300
Look.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.500
- If you need some money...
- Get the fuck out of here.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.800
All right. Let's go get a drink.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.865
What should I get Hugh for his birthday?

15:53.900 --> 15:58.000
I was thinking cigars but I figured
you were probably gonna bring some.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.800
Actually I decided not to go.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.500
In light of the situation, I went, I saw Carm,

16:04.600 --> 16:07.600
I told her I thought it'd be best if I sit it out.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.565
Hi, Phil, Joe.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.000
Where's your brother-in-law, doll?

16:29.035 --> 16:31.200
I wouldn't know.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.300
Hey, Philip, how the hell are you?

16:35.400 --> 16:38.065
- How's the neck?
- Where's the car?

16:38.100 --> 16:41.165
We all passed a lotta water
since the old days, huh?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.800
I was away when all that shit
went down with your brother.

16:44.835 --> 16:46.665
What the fuck happened?

16:46.700 --> 16:49.200
We don't like to talk about it.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.300
Your car's in here, Phil.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.500
It's all set.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.099
What the fuck is this?

17:08.900 --> 17:10.765
It was a front-end collision, Phil.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.800
- This new paint isn't as brilliant.
- It's factory paint, same as original.

17:14.835 --> 17:17.099
It is different. It's duller.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.300
Something's off with the seat.

17:28.335 --> 17:30.300
What is it, Phil?

17:30.400 --> 17:34.200
Feels off kilter. Try it, Joey.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.150
You're right. It's off its axis.

17:47.185 --> 17:49.500
It reclines strange too. Try it.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.100
Nobody said anything about the seats.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.800
This is unacceptable.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.500
Come on, Joey.
Give me a call when you get the job done.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.000
A couple of days, Phil.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.100
We did what was asked of us.

18:03.135 --> 18:05.100
Call me when it's done right.

18:10.900 --> 18:14.600
So, Dad, how does dinner
at Vesuvio's sound for your birthday?

18:14.700 --> 18:17.400
Just us. We'll come here first
for the presents

18:17.500 --> 18:20.000
and then we'll go over there.

18:20.100 --> 18:24.000
Sure, sure. That sounds fine.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.100
- Did somebody tell you something?
- I know all about it.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.000
- You can save the cloak and dagger.
- AJ!

18:34.900 --> 18:36.100
What?

18:36.200 --> 18:40.100
- Junior Soprano told me all about it.
- That miserable fucking man.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.865
You don't know the half.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.065
Relax. I'm fine with knowing.

18:45.100 --> 18:49.800
At my age, it's surprise enough
to be able to get out of bed every morning.

18:49.835 --> 18:51.800
So who's coming to this shindig?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.665
God damn him!

18:53.700 --> 18:57.100
All of us, your brother Lester, Dr Fegoli.

18:57.135 --> 18:59.565
Russ Fegoli? He's in town?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.765
He retired from the Foreign Service.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.600
But they were living
out in Marin County or wherever.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.050
Well, they settled on Jersey.

19:07.085 --> 19:09.400
Octavia, the oldest, lives here.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.400
Wait, who's Dr Faggo?

19:13.435 --> 19:15.865
Fegoli. Feg.

19:15.900 --> 19:19.400
She of the five-page Christmas card.
And on Flag Day,

19:19.900 --> 19:22.700
Papa Russ shook hands
with Andrew Cuomo.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.700
What an honour. B-F-D.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.900
The Fegoli kids finished college.

19:26.935 --> 19:28.965
That's what sticks in your craw.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.100
When he got that medal, you two weren't
even invited to the ceremony.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.200
It was out in California!

19:35.300 --> 19:39.000
They knew that your father
doesn't like to be out of his element.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.200
Now, here's someone
we can all be proud of, Anthony.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.000
Dr Fegoli served in the State Department.

19:48.100 --> 19:52.100
In Rome, he was career assistant
to the ambassador to the Vatican.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.965
He got a medal from the Pope himself.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.400
- Wow.
- But when we were kids in the navy,

19:57.500 --> 19:59.565
he had such a bad case of the crabs

19:59.600 --> 20:02.400
we used to call him
the Governor of Maryland.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.217
Stop acting like a child.

20:04.252 --> 20:06.000
Lighten up. He's old enough.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.600
She's right, knock it off.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.300
- Who else is coming?
- Freddy Di Novi...

20:12.800 --> 20:14.800
Tony'll love him.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.865
Who else?

20:18.900 --> 20:21.000
Dad, Tony isn't coming to the party.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.800
Why?

20:22.900 --> 20:25.365
Well, I felt that since we're separated,

20:25.400 --> 20:28.400
we should get used
to the idea of living separate lives.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.165
That's a crock of shit.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.500
Don't talk to her like that.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.200
I've known the man for 20-something years!
It's his house!

20:36.300 --> 20:38.465
Tony is in agreement with me.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.700
Because you put the screws to him.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.965
- I'll cancel the party.
- Go ahead.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.800
I'm not coming
if the man of the house isn't there.

20:51.300 --> 20:55.300
Tony, it's Angie. We did all the repairs
you said on Phil's car.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.100
He came today and now he found
a dent in the rear.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.965
- His seat. There's a problem with that.
- His seat?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.400
I didn't wanna get into these extras
without checking with you.

21:04.435 --> 21:06.600
You wanna run a body shop,
run a body shop.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.800
You claimed your piece of the garage.

21:08.900 --> 21:13.000
So you wanna be in business,
do what you think the situation calls for.

21:13.035 --> 21:14.900
I wanna put my kids through college.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.065
That's a good thing, Ange.

21:17.100 --> 21:20.300
Some women left alone like that
would've given up.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.200
Tony, before I outlay for these costs,
I need to know...

21:24.235 --> 21:28.000
Ange, I'm not there, what do I know?
It's your call.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.800
Tone. What's up?

21:45.900 --> 21:48.665
Pussy's Body Shop is one
of your stops, right?

21:48.700 --> 21:52.900
They're fixing the fucking Shah of Iran's car.
Be there when he picks it up.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.400
Make sure he's happy, but don't let the shit
spiral out of control.

21:56.500 --> 22:00.300
- Right. I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.500
I'm on my way to Welsh Farms,
get a triple blueberry sundae.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.650
Good for you. Enjoy.

22:06.685 --> 22:08.700
Hot summer night...

22:10.200 --> 22:12.200
Go for it. You deserve it.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.900
All right, yeah. I'll talk to you later.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.400
- Opus.
- Fine choice.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.600
Angelo here spoke very highly of you,

22:25.700 --> 22:28.100
how you handled yourself in Pennsylvania.

22:28.135 --> 22:29.900
That's why I wanted to meet you.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.400
We were like Frick and Frack in the can.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.365
Angelo's my buddy.

22:35.400 --> 22:39.500
He knew the Jackie Gleason stuff by heart.
He acted all the parts.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.100
Do a little bit for Rusty, the mambo thing.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.800
Mambo? Oh, Carlos
was teaching you the mambo!

22:49.835 --> 22:52.300
That's a different story!

22:52.400 --> 22:54.900
Get out! Get out!

22:59.200 --> 23:01.800
So how's your re-entry been?
You doing OK?

23:01.835 --> 23:03.700
Yeah. Tony's been good with me.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.400
- I always liked your cousin.
- He's a real gentleman.

23:07.435 --> 23:09.500
Angelo's looking out for you too.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.900
I told Rusty that you might need a little earn.

23:15.300 --> 23:19.300
Yeah, I could use a little cash injection,
maybe a push up the pyramid.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
You know, time served?

23:23.700 --> 23:26.100
We need something done.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.300
A nice little payday for you,

23:28.400 --> 23:31.600
and an opportunity for you to hone
that rep you left behind.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.950
And this involves?

23:34.985 --> 23:36.900
Somebody needs to go.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.000
Anyone I know?

23:44.300 --> 23:46.700
New York guy, not Jersey.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.100
- Who is he with?
- Friend of a friend.

23:49.135 --> 23:50.900
Not a friend of ours.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.200
A friend of Johnny's.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.300
- You guys got to settle that shit.
- It's not the boat.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.900
It's not the boat.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.800
It's Lorraine Calluzzo.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.100
Rainey Calluzzo.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.400
Little Carmine went to school with her.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.900
They go back that far.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.700
Kill a woman? Come on.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.300
I can't sign on right now.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.500
I wanna give my cousin
the benefit of the doubt.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.000
He don't want us involved
in this problem over here anyway.

24:33.035 --> 24:35.700
Why don't you think about it for a bit?

24:35.800 --> 24:37.800
I don't know. I don't think so,

24:37.835 --> 24:40.300
but thanks, guys.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.700
We had a big talk over here the other day

24:42.800 --> 24:46.300
and the consensus seems to want
your presence at my father's party.

24:46.335 --> 24:49.200
Well, that's nice
but it's kinda short notice.

24:49.235 --> 24:52.000
Look, it's for my father, not me.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.900
I made plans to go fishing with Sil.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.900
Well, he really wants you there. If you
could make it, he would be very happy.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.900
He's very fond of you.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.600
The New York salsicc',
hickory wood, whatever.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.465
You're not using Artie?

25:09.500 --> 25:12.900
I got him doing appetisers
but he's really there as a guest.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.500
I am cooking.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.900
Tomorrow's gonna be a madhouse,
just a living hell.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.300
I don't know, I'll...

25:24.400 --> 25:26.700
I'll see what I can do.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.700
Thank you, Tony, I appreciate it.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.365
Jerry said to refrigerate.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.100
I think there is room in the garage.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.300
I know you're shorthanded.
I thought you might need some help.

25:54.335 --> 25:57.800
It's my weekend with the boys.
They'll stay out of the way.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.700
Aunt Carmela is nice enough
to let you guys enjoy her pool,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.900
and you wanna destroy her property.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.000
It's a beach chair! It can get wet.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.500
Don't get smart! You wanna go home?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.365
What can I do?

26:26.400 --> 26:29.200
The dips. I forgot the dips.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.800
I gotta duck out later.
I could get some at Grand Union.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.900
Grand Union closed ten years ago.

26:35.700 --> 26:40.000
You know what? Frig the dip.
They'll have to survive with salsa.

26:40.100 --> 26:43.500
Can I make you a cocktail?
I make a mean Rusty Nail.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.500
Now? No.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.400
Thanks again for letting
the kids take a swim.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.400
Any time, you know that.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.600
Cheers.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.900
They love being here.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
This is truly a beautiful home.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.200
What, are you here, five years now?

27:07.300 --> 27:10.500
I asked you to get up at 11:00.
We got a lot to do today.

27:10.535 --> 27:13.100
You were supposed to send
this for summer school.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.100
Put it down!

27:18.300 --> 27:21.300
- Greetings, birthday people.
- You are here, which is great.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.100
You can help with the setup.

27:23.135 --> 27:25.365
Hi, Mrs Soprano.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.800
This is our Uncle Tony.
This is Meadow's friend Finn.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.600
What are you doing?

27:31.700 --> 27:34.500
I'm making Grandpa's favourite icebox cake.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.600
- We have cake.
- Why don't you take a swim? You're hot.

27:38.635 --> 27:40.965
Do you have a towel?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I'll bring you a coffee too.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.600
- I'll be outside.
- Cake pan?

27:46.300 --> 27:48.450
Meadow, I have a lot to do today.

27:48.485 --> 27:50.600
Hello? I'm making dessert... to help.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.800
- He seems like a nice guy.
- Yep.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.100
- Any luck with Kelly?
- No.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.300
I've been scouring
the internet for any trace.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.900
Here is your cake pan.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.300
And you're gonna clean up
your baking mess!

28:26.600 --> 28:30.800
I can imagine how much
you must miss her, your only daughter.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.400
What was she, like 11,
when she lived with you guys?

28:33.500 --> 28:36.700
We had her 12th birthday party
right before she moved out.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.700
- How'd she do in school then?
- Straight As.

28:42.735 --> 28:45.600
My God. What is the matter with them?

28:51.900 --> 28:55.600
Don't lift that by yourself, Hugh,
wait for some help.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.150
What are you doing here?
You always do this!

28:59.185 --> 29:01.642
- The party is not for hours!
- He needs help.

29:01.677 --> 29:04.100
What am I doing?
Returning your port-a-vac.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.400
- You said you needed it.
- Happy birthday.

29:06.500 --> 29:10.500
- Later for that. Get your uncle out here.
- He left. He said he told you.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.000
He asked us to watch the twins.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.400
Here, help me with this.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.700
My goodness. What a bother.
Excuse us for living.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.665
How you doing? I'm Tony.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.300
Yeah, the other Tony's cousin, right?

29:33.400 --> 29:35.400
It reclines perfectly, try it.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.600
Fuck that. I don't feel
like I'm sitting at 12 o'clock.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.800
You're sitting at 12 o'clock.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.000
- May I?
- I don't give a fuck.

29:44.100 --> 29:47.100
You can sit in there
till fucking San Gennaro.

29:47.700 --> 29:52.200
It'll still need to be dealt with.
This car went through a major collision.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.300
It seems OK.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.700
How could it be OK if it's askew?

30:03.900 --> 30:06.200
What's the matter?
You got an eye problem?

30:06.235 --> 30:07.865
You look like Stevie Wonder!

30:07.900 --> 30:10.150
What'd I say? I didn't say nothing.

30:10.185 --> 30:12.400
Replacing the seat will cost a fortune.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.865
Give me a break, Phil. The seat is fine.

30:14.900 --> 30:20.000
You have a problem with the grain
on the leather. You think I'm stupid?

30:20.100 --> 30:21.900
Don't take it out on me!

30:22.000 --> 30:24.100
Come on, Joey.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.400
How about this?
Replace the tracks under the seat,

30:29.435 --> 30:31.200
maybe throw in a CD player.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.065
We already replaced the tracks.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.300
- He's got a CD player.
- Jesus God, Duke,

30:37.335 --> 30:40.500
they're hosing us for a $2,000 factory seat!

30:41.100 --> 30:42.765
Come on, Joey.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.400
- Tony, nice to meet you.
- Come on! You coming?

30:46.400 --> 30:48.600
Joe, try to keep him cooled down.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.400
Here you go, Freddy.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.800
Get it, Jason! Come on!

31:23.400 --> 31:24.765
My God.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.250
- Ma, what?
- Dr Fegoli... Russ.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.700
- What?
- He's allergic to tomatoes.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.300
All right, so we will deal with it.

31:32.335 --> 31:34.400
Jesus.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.500
Don't you have any hors d'oeuvres
without tomatoes?

31:38.100 --> 31:42.100
The prosciutto-wrapped chèvre.
Rosalie just took 'em out.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.050
An Italian allergic to pomodori?

31:49.085 --> 31:51.700
Dio mio. You have my sympathies.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.565
It wasn't always like this.

31:53.600 --> 31:58.200
It started when they gave me radiation
for my prostate. Don't ask me why.

31:58.300 --> 32:03.200
Did you know Monsignor Kelly? He was
in charge of the tours at all the catacombs.

32:03.235 --> 32:06.100
- I made you a plate, Russ.
- Thank you, Mary.

32:06.200 --> 32:10.500
You know, Carmela's mother-in-law Livia
detested northern cooking.

32:10.535 --> 32:13.900
- Really, why?
- She skeeved the butter.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.300
The father was like that, too.
The whole Soprano bunch.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.600
So many Neapolitans
and Sicilians feel that way.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.900
You really have to go to Italy to know
and so many of them don't.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.900
I ate like a champ up and down the boot
the whole two weeks.

32:29.400 --> 32:33.200
But those recipes that you used
to send me from Tuscany, Lena.

32:33.300 --> 32:36.000
My God, they were a revelation.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.300
Bollito misto, osso bucco...

32:39.700 --> 32:42.900
The lovely Carmela.
Would you like to say a few words?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.200
He's back, thank God.
Will you get the guests arriving?

32:46.300 --> 32:47.900
Where the hell is Tony?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.665
Have a glass of wine, it'll calm you down.

32:50.700 --> 32:54.400
He is bringing the charcoal
and the sausage. Always the last minute.

32:54.435 --> 32:58.200
- I heard that.
- Finally.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.600
- She's got no faith in me.
- I wonder why?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.500
Pins and needles, needles and pins.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.000
Palumbo's - the birthday boy's favourite.

33:11.035 --> 33:12.900
- Where is he?
- He's out back.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.565
Oh, good.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.200
Honey, pace yourself.

33:17.235 --> 33:19.765
Hey, there he is!

33:19.800 --> 33:21.900
Hey, happy birthday to you

33:21.935 --> 33:24.400
Got salsiccia for you

33:28.700 --> 33:32.200
Russ, wait till you taste this.
There's nothing else like it.

33:32.235 --> 33:34.700
I want you to meet
a couple of our oldest friends,

33:34.800 --> 33:36.600
Dr Russ and Lena Fegoli.

33:36.635 --> 33:38.400
Nice to meet you, sir.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.500
My son-in-law...
Well, whatever... Tony Soprano.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.400
A doctor, huh? That's good.
Somebody usually goes down at these.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.865
He's just joking.

33:48.900 --> 33:53.700
Unfortunately, my doctorate
is in international affairs.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.000
From Princeton.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.000
- GI Bill.
- So you're a doctor like...

34:00.100 --> 34:01.500
Kissinger's a doctor.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.965
Yes.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.800
Russ had an audience with four popes.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.000
- What section did you all sit in?
- Idiot!

34:13.000 --> 34:17.300
TB, make sure you shoot the food tables
before they're pillaged.

34:18.100 --> 34:21.699
Well, I'd love to stay and chat
but I got a fire to start.

34:21.735 --> 34:24.500
- Nice to meet you, Doc.
- Nice to meet you.

34:33.800 --> 34:37.699
Everybody!
Could you gather around, please?

34:37.735 --> 34:40.300
Everybody, everybody!

34:40.335 --> 34:42.100
Come on over.

34:44.699 --> 34:48.699
I would like to make
a toast to the man of the hour,

34:49.800 --> 34:51.465
a very special man,

34:51.500 --> 34:55.100
a man who I love more than words
could possibly say...

34:56.000 --> 34:58.465
- My father.
- Hear, hear!

34:58.500 --> 35:01.900
You are the best
father and grandfather in the world.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.200
Speech, speech!

35:08.800 --> 35:11.200
You are the greatest, my little Melly.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.000
Thank you for everything.

35:15.100 --> 35:18.800
Tony, thank you for having us at your home.

35:21.900 --> 35:25.400
Mare, my lovely bride.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.465
Still the prettiest girl in the world.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.900
Thank you for putting up
with me all these years.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.500
Thank all you freeloaders for coming!

35:47.900 --> 35:50.900
- Why don't you open up your gifts, Dad?
- Not now, Carmela.

35:50.935 --> 35:53.100
- It's very mercenary.
- Well, good.

35:53.135 --> 35:55.500
People spent money on them.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.800
I'll break the ice.

35:57.835 --> 36:00.265
Here.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.700
- Open this one.
- It's from him.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.900
You're too much.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.200
A Stratocaster?

36:21.800 --> 36:24.065
A Beretta.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.300
- It's a shotgun.
- Shotgun?

36:27.400 --> 36:30.500
This is... I don't know what to say.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.600
It's a Giubileo 12-gauge. 28-inch barrel.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.865
Nice to have money.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.565
Get me another Rolling Rock, Jay.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.300
What time did you start drinking today?

36:47.335 --> 36:49.800
Probably right after you got up.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.900
Coz!

36:52.000 --> 36:55.300
Tony, can you bring the camera over here
and get a shot of this?

36:55.900 --> 36:58.100
Sure, I got nothing better to do.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.300
I expect a freezer full of venison this year.

37:08.335 --> 37:10.600
You got it, kid.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.500
Beautiful piece. The over-under action,

37:28.535 --> 37:30.700
the engraving, they're artisans.

37:30.800 --> 37:35.300
And you know, I've been
to the Beretta studio in Brescia.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.100
No kidding. I'd love to see that.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.300
You know, that company
goes back to the 1500s.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.565
Madonna!

37:43.600 --> 37:46.150
Sure, the best pieces...

37:46.185 --> 37:48.700
they never export, you see.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.665
I want one and all here to know

37:57.700 --> 38:00.500
what a wild man Hugo was in his day.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.765
Remember what he did
at the Bund meeting in Paterson?

38:03.800 --> 38:07.700
- Threw that cherry bomb on those Krauts?
- Yeah, tell that one.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.900
You made my father's year with that gun.

38:14.935 --> 38:17.700
He deserves it.

38:19.900 --> 38:24.500
- You look beat. Take a break.
- Nah, I'm all right.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.900
- Could use a beer, though.
- Well, you got it.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.600
Thanks.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.200
How's that look? Done?

39:01.100 --> 39:03.200
You're the grill-meister.

39:11.300 --> 39:15.100
Don't get me wrong, we have
the greatest legal system in the world,

39:15.135 --> 39:18.100
but it's becoming
more and more discriminatory.

39:18.200 --> 39:22.500
If you're a minority, or worse,
an immigrant from an Arab country,

39:22.535 --> 39:24.600
civil rights don't apply at all.

39:24.700 --> 39:28.600
In no place is the breach of civil rights
more evident than the penal system.

39:28.635 --> 39:31.265
- Rehabilitation? Please.
- Yeah.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.365
That nature of the system
instils the convict mentality

39:34.400 --> 39:39.000
to the point where prison becomes the only
venue where the convict can function.

39:39.035 --> 39:40.900
My little bleeding heart.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.500
She is wise beyond her years.

39:43.535 --> 39:44.665
She better be,

39:44.700 --> 39:48.700
all the money I'm spending
over at Liberal University in sunny Harlem.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.300
Come here.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.400
- How you doing?
- Good.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.300
Remember when you were little
what I called you?

40:00.335 --> 40:02.000
You don't remember?

40:02.100 --> 40:04.400
- You were too young to remember?
- Stop!

40:08.300 --> 40:10.400
How could you not remember?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.200
You know Hugh built this house?

40:30.300 --> 40:33.900
Your friend's maxing out the situation
down at Puss's.

40:33.935 --> 40:35.700
Sure.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.200
Factory seat, 2K. I tried.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.800
I'd hate to see Ange get stuck with that.

40:45.600 --> 40:50.400
Then again, her friend is taking me
to the cleaners with this divorce shit.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.800
I gotta belt-tighten.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.700
Can we get some
able-bodied seamen over here?

41:02.735 --> 41:04.800
Tony B?

41:06.200 --> 41:08.200
What am I, a fucking slave?

41:11.500 --> 41:14.100
- I didn't have a drop.
- Goddamn you.

41:14.135 --> 41:16.700
Lester'll drive. He's in the bathroom.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.600
Watch your head.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.500
Hey! Virginia Mayo.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.100
Thank you for coming.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.500
I'm sorry for everything. What can I say?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.600
Get my boy home safe.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.500
You're sorry? For what?

41:48.600 --> 41:51.900
- No, no. I wanna hear.
- Oh, please, Carmela.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.600
The off-colour jokes, the sausage twirling...

41:57.500 --> 41:59.700
These are cultured Italians.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.800
Russ is a success, a diplomat.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.765
This was a shock for them.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.965
He's such a diplomat he insults his host?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.950
You heard what he said to Tony.
He's a pompous man.

42:08.985 --> 42:11.900
- He always was.
- Let's talk about this another time.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.100
That's why you didn't want Tony here.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.565
It had nothing to do with our situation.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.900
All along, it was so that your
cultured Italian friends,

42:20.000 --> 42:23.265
who were born and raised
on Arthur Avenue, I might add,

42:23.300 --> 42:26.700
- wouldn't meet Tony the gavone.
- He made us all look like gavones.

42:26.735 --> 42:30.200
Whatever we are,
I am proud of it, unlike you obviously.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.665
I have always been proud of my heritage.

42:32.700 --> 42:36.900
Bullshit. You told Aunt Rose you were glad
DeAngelis didn't end in a vowel.

42:36.935 --> 42:38.900
I never said that!

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
And when Meadow came out...
"Oh my God, she's so dark. "

42:42.100 --> 42:43.900
You're drunk. I'm going home.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.400
There are Italians all around
with their closet self-loathing.

42:47.500 --> 42:50.400
I just never wanted to believe
my mother was one of them.

42:50.435 --> 42:53.200
What the fuck are you crying about?

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Your secret is out.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.300
- Marco.
- Polo.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.600
Fish out of water! You're it, Tone!

43:15.635 --> 43:17.800
- I'm taking a T-O.
- Marco.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.400
Here, let me get this.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.400
No, I'm fine. You have fun.

43:24.500 --> 43:28.300
No, no, really. Let me... I'll get it. I'll get it.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.800
- Put me down!
- You look like you could use a dip!

43:31.900 --> 43:33.500
- Don't you... I'm serious!
- One.

43:33.535 --> 43:35.400
- AJ!
- Two.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.500
- Tony, don't!
- Three!

43:41.900 --> 43:44.100
- You bastards!
- You're it, Carm.

43:51.300 --> 43:53.300
- Idiots.
- Don't let her get out.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.400
You're still it!

44:08.000 --> 44:11.300
- All right. Pleasant dreams, hammers.
- Night, Dad.

44:11.335 --> 44:13.800
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.700
- Grandma's not a maid.
- I'll put 'em in the hamper.

44:18.735 --> 44:20.700
- What's this?
- I don't know.

44:20.735 --> 44:22.700
- Yes, you do.
- Shut up.

44:22.800 --> 44:25.400
Am I talking to you, Justin?

44:28.500 --> 44:30.800
I asked you a question, Jason.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.200
Pins.

44:35.300 --> 44:38.700
From the '96 Olympics in Atlanta,
it looks like.

44:40.900 --> 44:45.900
That's when you were stationed
in Saudi Arabia, right, Dad?

44:45.935 --> 44:49.600
Yes, that's right,
but I'm talking to your brother.

44:49.635 --> 44:51.600
You took this tonight, didn't you?

44:51.700 --> 44:53.465
I borrowed it from AJ.

44:53.500 --> 44:56.500
You stole this from your cousin
who opens his house to you?

44:56.600 --> 44:59.900
I found it on the floor
way in back of AJ's closet.

44:59.935 --> 45:02.567
He doesn't care. With all the stuff he has?

45:02.602 --> 45:05.200
He got to go to the Olympics
and everything.

45:05.700 --> 45:09.000
I love where he lives.
I don't wanna come back here.

45:15.800 --> 45:19.465
My son steals from his own family.

45:19.500 --> 45:22.200
You're gonna return it tomorrow
and apologise.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.400
Where are your Game Boys?

45:25.500 --> 45:28.900
That's mine. Jason's is in the drawer.

45:32.500 --> 45:34.600
I'm giving these to the Salvation Army.

45:34.700 --> 45:37.100
- I didn't do nothing!
- You're as bad as he is

45:37.135 --> 45:39.900
cos you didn't stop him!

45:44.500 --> 45:47.700
We should get going, AJ.
I don't wanna drop you off too late.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.500
Call me when you get to Patrick's.

45:49.600 --> 45:52.200
Yeah, I'll try. He's in a bad cell area.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.300
He'll try?

46:00.300 --> 46:02.665
Just showing her he's not a kid.

46:02.700 --> 46:05.400
I think he's showing her more than that.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.400
That's inevitable.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.100
It's scary is what that is.

46:11.135 --> 46:13.500
He'll be fine.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.100
- He's in love.
- Oh, please.

46:20.700 --> 46:23.300
You know what it's like at that age.

46:26.300 --> 46:28.300
Can't wait to see each other.

46:29.300 --> 46:31.900
Can't keep your hands off each other.

46:38.400 --> 46:42.100
- What am I doing?
- Tony, let's call it a night.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.100
Why?

46:45.600 --> 46:48.400
- You tired?
- Yes.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.900
Come on. Artie is right over there.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.100
He's comatose.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.800
This is nice, no?

47:17.100 --> 47:19.400
Doesn't it feel nice?

47:19.435 --> 47:21.700
I didn't say that.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.400
No, Tony, don't.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.050
So which type of torture instrument

48:26.085 --> 48:28.900
are we going to use to pound this?

48:47.700 --> 48:49.500
Hello?

48:50.500 --> 48:52.500
Blundetto.

How can I help you?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.700
I'm in.

You asleep?

Send him and John my best, huh?
