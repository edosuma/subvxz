WEBVTT

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
- Two minutes.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You're fine.
You're fine.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
You always use a condom.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
- Oh, my God.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
-

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
- Oh--ow!
- Sorry.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
- Hello?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Look, I'm sure things
are really scary right now,

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
but, you know,
it's probably gonna be okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Um...is there anything
I can do to help?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I mean, like, I have a car.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I can, like,
drive you home if you want.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
You can leave.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
- Wait...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
No way.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
If that is who I think it is,
I was just way too nice.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Ugh, a real blast
from the past.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Hey, dude.
-

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, Jesus.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
- Come on, like I haven't
seen you pee a thousand times.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
There was actually a time when
you wouldn't pee without me.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
- Bailey, can you just--

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
- So who's the lucky guy, huh?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, no--is it Kevin?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
- Where's my test?
- Ooh.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Ooh!

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Is it Kevin?
Please tell me.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Please tell me, come on.
- Please give it to me.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
- Who's the daddy?
- Just give it to me please.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
- Whose penis is it?
- Kevin's penis.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
- See, was that so hard?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Actually, don't answer that.
I don't wanna know.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Wow, so you're, um, with child.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
And it's definitely Kevin's?
- Yes, yes.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
- I don't know, man.
I didn't think you boned,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
let alone raw dog--

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm honestly, like,
a little impressed.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
- I do not "raw dog."

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
We use condoms, which are
supposed to be 98.7% effective.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
- Well, apparently,
one of them was 0%.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
- That's not
how statistics work.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
- Are you reading this right?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
- Uh--
- Oh, hey, Veronica.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
- Heather.
- I'm so glad I caught you.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Would you mind looking
at the layout

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
for the yearbook prom page?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Let me just pull it back up--
- Whoa, no.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
No spoilers on the yearbook.
Come on, dude, God.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
- Um, okay.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Why don't you email
that to me, Heather,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
and then I can really
process the nuances

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
of the squiggly border
that you chose.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
- I'm so glad
you noticed the b--

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
- Ronnie.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
- Oh, hey, hey.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
- You okay, Ronnie?
You seem a little flustered.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
- Yeah, yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
- Are you trying
to talk to Bailey Butler?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
- Remember when you guys
used to be besties?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
- Yeah, that was--
that was more

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
'cause our moms were close
and everything.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
- Speaking of parents,
mine are in Greece.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Wanna stay over this weekend?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
- Who's got that green
nail polish that I like?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
what the hell?
- Where is it?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
- Oh, I wrote your name on it,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
and then I tied it
to the flagpole.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Hope that's cool.
- Can you just give it to me?

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
- I threw it in the dumpster
behind the gym.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
- Oh.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, thank you.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Thank you for bringing it
all the way back there.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
- Eh, I was smoking
a joint back there anyway.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Mr. Aster's been screening

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
this "Osmosis Jones"
VHS in bio,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
so I gotta come correct.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
- It's unbelievable.
- Right?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
There's, like, barely
any hard science in it,

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
but Chris Rock is a visionary.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
- No, you're smoking
on school grounds.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
That's, like,
really irresponsible.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
- Oh, I'm
the irresponsible one?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
- Okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
- Ah, okay, okay, okay,
ah, look.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I mean, I'm sure
it's gonna be okay, though?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I mean, your sister
had a kid early,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
and she's fine, right?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Remember when we found out

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
that you were gonna be
a nine-year-old aunt?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
We were cracking up--
- Okay, okay, you can stop.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I appreciate what you did
with the test and everything,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
but we're not just like...

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
You just happened
to be the person

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
that walked in the bathroom.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
- Oof.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Could have left it at thanks.
Catch you on the flip, Juno.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
- Guys, check this out.
Look at this.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
- Let me see it.
- Oh, my God.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Hi, hi, um, hi.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I, uh, am doing a report
for my health class,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
and I just wanted to see if I
could ask a quick question?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Cool, thanks.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Um, if a young woman
needs a procedure,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
but her parents didn't know,
is that possible?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Uh, let's say she's 17.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Okay, okay,
so not at your facility.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Where's the closest place
that...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
There's an Albuquerque
in Missouri?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay, um, well, sorry.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
What about, like,
Illinois or Arkansas,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Oklahoma, Texas?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
No?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay, okay, so I get it.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It sounds like she would need
parental consent,

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
which is--that's great.
That's totally fine.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Uh, I will include
that in my report,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
and thank you very much, bye.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
- Mom, I'm gonna go
to Emily's for a cram weekend.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
- Trust you.
Love you.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
- That was so stupid.
Maddie B is gonna--

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
- Hey.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
- Hey.
- Oh, my gosh, hey, girl.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
- Sorry I'm late.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
- Who'd you guys--
- Okay, Maddie D.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
- No, not Maddie D.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
- Um, there's actually
something pretty important

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I have to talk
to you guys about.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
- Okay, just give me
one second.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm actually really close.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
- Yeah, "Veronica Mars"
over here

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
thinks that she can figure out

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
the pregnancy test
mystery thing.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
- What pregnancy test
mystery thing?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
- Look.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
- Recycle Club found it
in the dumpster.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
- Ugh, Maddie B's profile's
on private.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
- No.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
- Ooh, okay.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So Tori Leonards
wasn't in gym today,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
and I know for a fact
that she used "lady issues"

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
as her excuse.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
- You use that excuse
to skip gym,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
like, every other week.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
- Valid, which is actually
why I'm leaning

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
more towards
Patricia Hamilton?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
- Absolutely not, no.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
There's no way
Patricia Hamilton

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
has lost her V card.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
- Well, it's, like, none
of our business, right?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
- I know,
but it's just so juicy,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I gotta figure out who it is.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
- I mean, what if
it was one of us?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
- Totally, but who takes
a pregnancy test at school?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
- Okay, seriously,
look at these grams,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
though, side by side.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Patricia's belly
definitely looks bigger.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
- Literally only a week ago.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
- A little bit.
- The way she's standing there.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
- No, that's not,
like, a burrito belly.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Like, that's
significantly bigger.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
- No, it's literally bigger,
like her face even...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
- She's glowing.
I mean, it's kind of--

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
- Mwah, I'm so sorry
I'm late, babe.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Got a new pup at the shelter.
Had to get him squirreled away.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, check it out.
Named him Jasper.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
- Uh, yeah, it's--
thanks for...

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
- Looks like
Elliot's dog, right?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
- Meeting me so last minute
and everything.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
- Course.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
- Good evening.
- Hey.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
We will start off
with the cheesy breadsticks,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and a water for the lady,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and I'll go
with a Mountain Dew.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
- All right, coming right up.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
- What's up?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
- Um...so...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I have to tell you something.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Um, I don't know
how it happened.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Statistically,
it's, like, nearly impossible,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
but, uh...

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm pregnant.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Okay.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay, hey, it's okay.
I'm--I'm here for you.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Thank you.
That's such a relief.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
I--I mean, I know what I want
to do, and I have a plan.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I could just use really use
your help with some--

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
what's happening right now?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
- Will you marry me?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Look, I know
it won't be easy, okay?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But, babe, we can do this.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
- Can you sit back down
in your chair please?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
- Yeah, yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
You gotta admit, it's kind of
perfect timing, you know?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
We were so unsure about us
next year, you know,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
and now we have this.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You know,
we'll take a year off,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
get a little place in town
so our parents can help out,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
and don't worry--the birth
won't conflict

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
with the X Games schedule
whatsoever, so--

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
- Wait, wait, wait--
how is it

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
that you already have
all of that planned?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
- Well, I mean, you said
you had something important

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
that you wanted to tell me.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Um...

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
you know, and then the whole
mystery pregnancy test thing

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
reminded me
of this other little thing.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Um, don't get mad
but, remember,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
like, a month ago
at Smith Creek

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
when we got finished
in the car?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Well, I sort of noticed that
the, um--the condom had broke.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So...
- Are you kidding me?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
- Look, Veronica, I didn't want
to freak you out, okay?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
- Oh, my--
- The valedictorian thing--

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
you had a lot
on your mind, you know?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And the further away we got,
the more mad I knew you'd be--

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
- Kevin, I--oh--

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
- And I looked it up.
I Googled it.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Do you know how hard it is
to get pregnant?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
It is, like, so hard.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
- I literally could have taken
the morning after pill.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I could have avoided
this whole entire situation.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
- I know it's kind of
stressful, okay?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
But it's also kind of perfect

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
because now we really know
that we'll be together forever.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
- I'm serious.
I can't.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I need to get out of here.
- Veronica--

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh, shoot.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
- Oh, God.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh, it's morning sickness.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Here, let me--I 'll hold
your hair for you.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Look, I know I messed up, okay?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
But if you can see past that,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
there's something
that's so beautiful here,

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
and I'm so stoked to bring
a little us into this world.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
- Can I--can I look at that?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
- Yeah, can I--
- No, I'll just--

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
- Okay.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
- Wow, this doesn't look cheap.
How'd you afford this?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
- Sold Buzzsaw and Road Rash.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Uh, my dirt bikes.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Only down to two now,
but...it's okay.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
- You know,
I'm definitely gonna need

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
some time to think about it,
but let's talk on Monday, okay?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
- Oh, yeah, Monday.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Monday's good.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
- Whew.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Great.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Crap.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I just pwned your ass!

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You won't be laughing
when I literally

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
rip your balls off, scumbag.
Come on.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Wait, cover me.
I'll be right back.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I thought you were
staying in tonight.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
- Oh, I know.
I'm sorry.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Fil got the night off.
- Oh, man, that guy's weird.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Who spells "Phil" with an F?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
- Be nice.
- Wait.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I already started
thawing the dough.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
- I'm sorry, my little pea,
but you know,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
we can make
the coxinhas tomorrow or,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
you know what,
maybe Sunday.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
I'll text you when I know

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
how the weekend
is shaping up, okay?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Mwah.
How do I look?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
- Hot as hell.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
- Mm-hmm, bye.
- Bye.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
- Oh, dude, come on.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
The whole pregnancy mystery
bullshit thing

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
is not my fault.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I threw the thing
in the dumpster.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
- I need your help, and I don't
have anywhere else to go.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
- I'm listening.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
- Okay, I know we're not,
like, close anymore.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
- True.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
- And I'm probably the last
person that you wanna help...

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
- Accurate.
- But you have a car.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
- Oh, there it is.
- Trust me.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
If I could just go
somewhere in town

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
or to St. Louis even,
I wouldn't even be here.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
- Go where?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
- You know, to get the thing--

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
the procedure.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
- Whoa.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
- Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
- You printed a map.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
- Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico--
it's easy,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
and I outlined the best route

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
including where we can stop
for gas, food, and rest.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's all planned out.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
We'll be in Albuquerque
by tomorrow night.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
We'll go to the clinic
first thing Sunday morning,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and we'll be home
Sunday evening.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
- Albuquerque.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
- Yeah, yeah,
I know it sounds crazy,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
but that is the closest place
if you're under 18, so...

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
- And I don't have to,
like, be there during, right?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Say if I wanted
to go explore Albuquerque

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
while you're doing your thing.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
- Yeah, that's--that's fine,
I guess.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I really just need you
to drive.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I'll pay for everything.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
- Hm...

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
so you're hiding this
from your man,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
your best friends,
and your Jesus freak parents,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
and you thought,
"Why not ask Bailey Butler

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
"to drive me hundreds of miles

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
'cause she probably doesn't
have anything to do anyway."

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
- Um...kind of, yes.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Bailey.
Bailey, come on.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Please open the door, Bailey.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
- I'm just messing with you.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
You're right--I do not have
anything going on.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
- I thought you drove a Camry.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
- Sleater-Camry's in the shop.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
- Uh, my gas projections
were accounting

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
for a four-cylinder
Japanese engine.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
- My bad.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
If we're worried about gas,
we should just take the Tesla.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
- Whoo, road trip!

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
- Oh, oh, oh, we gotta
check out Roswell.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Like, there's actual aliens--
- No. No.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
- Veronica, come on.
It's my vacation too.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
- This is not a vacation, okay?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
- Well, if it's not a vacation,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
then why are you
taking pictures, huh?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
- Okay, in 20 miles,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
we're gonna make
our first stop.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
- Yes, yes, love stops.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
We should go check out
the world's biggest fork.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I actually hear that--
- No, no, Bailey.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
We're not just gonna be
stopping willy-nilly, okay?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
We need to stick
to the schedule

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
so I can be home
by Sunday evening,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
and my parents won't find out.
Every stop has a purpose.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
- Wow, you even
bummed out nature.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
- This trip
is not gonna be cheap,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
but I think that this
should cover it.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
- Whoa, Jesus, what--did you
steal that from your parents?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
- Kevin proposed.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
What?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, my God.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
That is actually
so on brand for him.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Could you imagine, like,
actually getting married

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
to that guy?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
What, would your first dance be

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
to Imagine Dragons
or Nickelback, do you think?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
- Kevin--he means well, okay?
You just don't know him.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
He's...he's uncomplicated.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
He's sweet.
He's so sweet.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Did you know that he volunteers
with little puppies,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
like, that don't have homes
and stuff?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
And I don't even need
to defend myself to you now.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
But did you know that he
asked me out

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
literally every day for a month
until I said yes?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
He literally waited
outside my window

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
one night for a whole night.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
- You know, "Say Anything"
made that seem cute,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
but it's called stalking,
so time's up on all that.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That dude's an actual stalker.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
- Okay, the entrance
should be right up

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
around the corner here.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
- Cool, I'm excited
to die here.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
- It's not opening.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I know they're not closed.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
That guy literally
just went in there.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
- After you, Ivy League.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
- I said I ain't gonna buy it.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
- Move.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
- Hello, hi.
Um...

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I was actually just wondering
how much I could get for this.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It's, like, real
and everything.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
- Mm-hmm.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
How old are you?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
- 17.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
- I can't buy this.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
- Um...

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
sorry, I just...

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
I just--I really,
really need the money,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
so if there's just anything--
- I said--

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
- Veronica, I love you.
- Stalker.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
- Kevin.
- I can't live without you.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
- What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
- I know you said you wanted
to wait until Monday,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
but to me, Monday feels
like it's ten years

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
from now, you know?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
So I said,
"Bro, go get your girl."

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
This really is not a good time.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
- Look, I got you a rose
for every single reason

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
why we should spend
our lives together--

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
you, me, and the baby.
- It's not a baby yet.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
- This is for how rad
your genes and my genes

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
are gonna look together
in a new human.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
This one is for
when I teach him or her

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
how to do a perfect kickflip.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
- Weird flex.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
- And this one is for the fact

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
that you get to stay
here in Missouri--

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
- Okay, you know what?
This has got to stop.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I can't do it.
Here are a bunch of roses.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
They're a bunch of reasons.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
- What is she doing
with my ring?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
- Uh...

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
well, I need the money for...

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm sorry, Kevin, but I'm
taking care of the situation.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
- You're--you wanna get rid--

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I know it wasn't chill

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
to not tell you
about the condom breaking--

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
- Whoa, you knew
about the condom breaking?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
Who even asked you?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Why is she even here?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
- She's driving me
to the place.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I can't do it in Missouri.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
- Well, you can't make
this decision alone.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
- Kevin, we have
so much life ahead of us.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
This is just--
this is what I have--

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
- What life, Veronica?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
You're going off to Brown.
I'm staying here.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
This is our shot
at being together.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
- No, Kevin--

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
- You should be thankful
and count your lucky stars

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
that you have a guy
who's so devoted to you

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
that he would literally
track you down

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
to this freaking skeezy dump.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
- You tracked me here?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
- Well, I mean, like, kind of.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
What are you doing?
- That's so creepy, Kevin!

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
You're a stalker!
- Thank you.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
- Give me my ring back then.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Jesus!

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
- Consider your next move
very carefully.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
- That is my ring.
I paid for that.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Okay.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Gonna grab my phone.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I got it.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
- I mean,
could have just deleted

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
your Find My Friends app.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
- I'll give you $1,300.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
- We're rich!
- Are you serious?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Thank you.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I don't even know
how to begin to thank you.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
This is--you are such
a sweet woman for helping us.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
- If any of this
comes back on me,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I'll sew the two of you
together as a human centipede.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
- Oh.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
- You know,
it's pretty messed up

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
that Kevin didn't even tell you
about the condom breaking.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
- I really don't
wanna talk about it.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
- I know, I'm just saying
that you had every right

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
to sell that ring
after what he did.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
- Really don't
wanna talk about it.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Can you just drop it
for now, please?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
- All right.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm just gonna
turn on the radio.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
or Should I Go?"

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh, oh!

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
or should I go now?

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
or should I go now?

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
there will be trouble

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
there will be double

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Okay, okay, okay.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
- That song literally
makes zero sense.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's--it just makes--
okay, he's saying

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
if he leaves,
there will be trouble,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
but if he stays,
there will be double?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
What--the choice
is clearly to leave.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
It's literally half
the amount of trouble.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Wow.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Man, that has gotta be

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
the most clinical
interpretation

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
of a punk song, like, ever.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
- Okay, if we drive for
another, like, five hours, we--

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
- Oh, a Gas N' Gulp!

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
- Wow, I see you're taking
the budget really seriously.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
- Hm, oh,
and you have, like, what,

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
three sips of water
in that thing?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
- Well, we're driving 14 hours.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
We can't be stopping
every two seconds to pee.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
We actually really have to go--
so are you done?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
- One more thing.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
- Hi, these
and a few more things.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
- Half blue raspberry,
half cherry

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
with a squirt of Coke on top.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
- Our combo.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
- Yep.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
- Thank you.
This is really sweet of you.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
- I mean, relax.
It was two for one.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
- If we make good enough time,
we can maybe go to Roswell.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
- Stop.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Hell yeah, aliens!

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
- Maybe.
-

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
- Okay?

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
If I think
that you might like me

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
- What time's your appointment
on Sunday?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
- We're almost in Oklahoma

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
where we'll take
a four hour powernap...

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
and we should be getting
to some open areas

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
in about 18 miles,
and that's gonna be

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
the perfect place to stop.
- Nice.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Love a good open area.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Ooh, we're about
to cross state lines.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
You know what that means.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
- No, no--
- Yep.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
- I--I don't remember that.
- Three...

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
- No, seriously that was so...
- Two...

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
- Long ago--I don't even know--
- One.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Whoo, whoo!

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Boom, boom.
Mm, mm.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
- Zoom.

27:02.000 --> 27:02.000
Ooh.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
- Ah!

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
both: Much-coach Pu!

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Haven't done that one
in a while.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
- Yeah, I--I really don't know

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
how we remembered
that whole thing.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Wow, it's really messy in here.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
What is all this
you have down here?

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
- Whoa, whoa,
do not throw that.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
- Why do you have a taser?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
- Oh, I was hoping to hold up
some liquor stores on the way.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Hope that's cool.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
- No.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
- Veronica, we are
two teenage girls

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
going across the country
in the middle of the night.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
I took that from my mom, okay?
Can you put it in my bag?

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
- Okay.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
- It's not gonna tase you,
Veronica.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
- I don't know how they work.
- Very easy.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Point and shoot.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Got extra blankets
in the back.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
- No, I'm fine.
This will be comfortable.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
- Okay, suit yourself.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
- I'm setting the alarm
for 5:00 a.m., okay?

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
That way, we'll be in Texas
by lunch.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
I have $20 set aside
for breakfast,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
so we can stop somewhere early.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
And, Bailey,
you've really gone overbudget

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
with the jacket and stuff,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
so can you just please
be more mindful?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
- Do you have, like,
a PowerPoint presentation?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
I'm a little bit more
of a visual learner.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
- You know what?
Actually, I do.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Let me just pull it up
really quick.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Where are the blankets?
- In the back.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
- "Selfcare" huh?

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
- Yeah, I had to post something
so people wouldn't bother me.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
- Of course, and so people
wouldn't know you're with me.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Your stuff's,
like, really intense.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
- Colleges look
at that sort of thing,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
so it's strategic.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
- Before we would've laughed
at that kind of stuff,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
but I guess that's not who
you strategically are anymore.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
- You know what?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I'm not gonna
do this right now.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
We only have four hours
for sleep, so I'm going to bed.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
- Oh, well, let me know
when you pencil in a time

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
to talk about the fact
that you used to be fun

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and used to do things
like aggressive ballerina

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
or collect PokÃ©mon cards

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
and how you've literally become
one of those people

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
who walk, talk, and act
exactly the same.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
You know who you are?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
You're Captain Picard
at the end of season four.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
You've assimilated
into the Borg.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
You don't even realize it.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
- You're completely wrong
as usual.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
- Oh, really?
Please do enlighten me.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
- Captain Picard
gets assimilated

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
into the Borg at the end
of season three.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
- God, do you have
to be good at everything?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
You know what?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
You're not
Captain Picard, okay?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
You're Data.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
You're a weird
information robot.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Why do I feel bad now?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
I'm the one who's doing
something nice here.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
And we both know you
wouldn't do the same for me.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
- Yeah...you're right.
I probably wouldn't.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
-  Soj.
- Food?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
- Yes.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
I gotta use the  puchpa'.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
- What's changed?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
- I just don't understand
what is going on here.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
- I am being suffocated here.
That's why.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Between you and that kid
and this house--

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
- She's not "that kid."
She's your daughter.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
- My life doesn't stop
and start every time Bailey

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
has some damn science fair
or school play

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
or whatever the hell--

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
- Snack break time.
I'm getting us some--

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
- Hey, let's go ride our bikes.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Let's go right now.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
- Ah!
- Ah.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
- How did we miss that?
Amazing.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
- Oh, no, it's 9:30.
It's 9:30.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
We gotta go, okay?
We should be in Texas by now.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
We gotta go.
Oh, man.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
No, no Funyuns
until we're on the road.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Come on!

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
- Come on,
I'm eating breakfast.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
- Bailey!

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Come on, seriously, Bailey,
we need to go now!

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
We're, like,
hours behind, okay?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Come on!
- Ow!

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Oh, stop, no!

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Oh, that's real cute, okay.
-

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
- Now there's no
breakfast for nobody, great.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Let's ride or die, baby!
Whoo!

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
achieving myself

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
don't wear no Spanx

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
and the booty say hey

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
more than me

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
more than me

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
no drama

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
- Moo!

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
baby, I love you

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
see it ain't your fault

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
and the sauce

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
for the sauce and the drip

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
for the sauce and the drip

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Whoo, whoo!

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
And I don't give him
no drama

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
both: Muh-coach Pu!

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
baby, I love you

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
- Oh, come on!
Yes.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
since you been gone

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
- Kelly, really?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
- Okay.
-

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
- I didn't say
you had to turn it off.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
- What?
No, no, it's fine.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
- You can turn the music
back on if you want.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
- No, no, no, I'm good.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
- What are you doing?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Whoa.
- Whoo!

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
- What the heck?
-

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
- What is happening?
Why did you just do that?

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
- Um, I'm hungry.
We should eat.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
- Okay.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Why are we parking
way back here?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
- Uh, this car
is a hot commodity, man.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
These small towns are,
like, notorious for theft.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
- They are?

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
- Uh, oh yeah, huge problem.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
If you took your head out of
your book every now and then,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
maybe you'd know stuff
like that--you know,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
learn some street smarts.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
- Hey, street smarts,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
your wallet's dangling
out of your backpack.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
- Huh?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Wait, wait--

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
- You attract a lot
of male attention.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
- Thank you.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
- Here we go.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
- That's quite some car
you ladies rolled up in.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
What kind of trouble y'all
getting into this evening?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
- Dude, mind your business.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
- Whoa, whoa, easy.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm just trying
to be welcoming.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
I'm Jarrod.
So where you headed?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
- Um, Albuquerque.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
- Can I come?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
- Uh, table for two, please?

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
- Anywhere you want.
This isn't Applebee's.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
- Ah, just some
unsolicited advice--

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
if you're gonna
shoot your shot,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
I recommend zipping up
your fly first.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
- What can I get you girls?

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
- Can I get the spaghetti
and meatballs please?

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
- May I please have the burger,
but instead of fries,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
can I just get
a side salad, please?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
- We don't really have
a side salad.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
It's just gonna be more
of the same lettuce.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
- Okay, just the burger
then is fine.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Actually, can I get
some fries please?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Thank you.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
- I don't know why
you're so judgy.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I'm just trying to save funds.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Speaking of, where we at,
Donna from accounting?

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
- I actually really appreciate
you taking an interest.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
- Of course you do.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
- Um, okay, so I have $500 set
aside for the procedure.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
That leaves $450 for gas,
$200 for emergency fund,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
and we have exactly $112
left over for food.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
- Maybe we do a little
pre-appointment brunch, huh?

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
Speaking of, when is
your appointment tomorrow?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Veronica, you do have
an appointment

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
for tomorrow, right?
- Huh?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Um, oh, well, they take
walk-ins, so it's fine.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
- Oh, V.
- What?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
- Come on.
- What?

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
I--I tried calling,
but every time they answered,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
I just got freaked out
and hung up, so...

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
- Wow, got it, okay.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
- I know, I know.
It's stupid.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
- Son of a bitch.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
- Okay, well,
it's not that bad.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Okay, what's happening?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
- Nothing, it's fine.
Here, try some lemonade.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
- No, why are those cops
looking at the car?

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
- Um, like--like, cool thing
I forgot to mention

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
is that, um...

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
that's my mom's
asshole boyfriend's car,

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
and I didn't exactly formally
ask him if I could borrow it,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
so he may be, like,
looking for it.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
- We're driving a stolen car?
- Shut up, shut up.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
- My gosh.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
- Is it stolen
if you know the person?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
The rules are very fake.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
- They are not.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
If the owner did not
let you drive it,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
then it is stolen.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
- Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta bail.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
- I don't--I don't think
we can bail.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
What do we do?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
What do we do?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
- Excuse me.
- What?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
- I wanna ask you...

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
- Can you say something
helpful please?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
- I don't know.
I'm really sorry.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
- Excuse me...

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
-Oh, yeah, that's our boy!

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
God shed
his grace on thee

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
- Get down.
You think that's funny, huh?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
And for thy goods
with brotherhood

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
- That's enough now.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
- Got a great singer
right here!

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
- Oh, shoot.
My backpack was in that car.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
I--why'd you lie about this?
- I know.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
- I can't believe you did that.
- I know--I ruined everything.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I jeopardized this whole thing.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I swear, Veronica, if I make
you miss your appointment--

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
I screwed up again.
- Okay, it's okay.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Calm down.
We can--we can do this.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
We can figure this out.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
- No, I should never
have said yes.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Obviously I cannot be relied on
for literally anything,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
and we're gonna go to jail.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Look, I need--
I need to go back.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I need to explain
the situation.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Maybe I can avoid
getting you arrested, yeah.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
- What?
No--no, no, no.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Don't leave me out here, okay?

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm gonna get murdered
if I try to travel alone.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
Bailey, Bailey, I need you.
- Nobody needs me.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
- No, I do.
I need you.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I really do.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Wait!

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Wait, let me just
show you one thing.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
- Veronica, I'm done.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
- Let me just--let me just
show you this one thing,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
and when I show it to you,
if you laugh,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
then you have to stay with me.
- What are you talking about?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
- Okay, just watch.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
- Wow,
aggressive ballerina, huh?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
- Veronica, this isn't fair.
Come on.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
-

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Okay, fine, fine, fine,
I'll go with you.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Fine, stop please.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Please, it's--no, no, really.
Really, stop.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Veronica, stop--oh.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
- Hey.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
It's you again.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
- When I asked
what kind of trouble

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
y'all was getting into,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I thought
I was just being cute.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
- Yeah, thanks
for saving us back there.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
That was nice.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Actually, uh, maybe you could--

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
could you drive us
to the closest bus station?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
- Ah, we already running
kind of late

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
to our buddy's thing
at the fairgrounds.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I mean, closest stop
is probably Amarillo.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
- Doesn't Matthews
live in Amarillo?

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
- That's true.
Hop on in.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
We'll take you
as far as the fairgrounds,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
and maybe you can scam a ride

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
off our friend
once you get there.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
- Um, I don't know
if we have time for that.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
- Well, either way,
we got about two minutes

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
'fore the cops pull up, so...

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
Not everybody's
gonna find clarity

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
kind of therapy

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
John Prine, and Camel Blues

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
leaves well enough alone

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
that ain't their own

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
my favorite people do

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I don't know about them,
but I know about us

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
and we love who we love

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
what we're going through

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
my favorite people do

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
all my favorite people do

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I don't know about them

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
and we love who we love

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
what we're going through

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
- Let's do this!

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
All right, come on, let's go!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
All my favorite
people do

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
- Ooh, here we go!

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
96 trying to double that lead
with number 12 in second.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
- Whoo!
Oh, my God!

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Looks like 23's
losing control!

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Oh, why?

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
Into the wall.
23 is out for the count.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
- Let's go, Matthews!

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
There go your ride right there.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Cerveza?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
- I don't drink.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
- Ah, you know, I thought
you might say that.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
- Thank you.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
- What a race!

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
- Let's go, Matthews!

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Hey, don't die, dude!
You still owe me 20 bucks.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
- This is it!
The final lap!

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
- This is so tight!
- It's pretty cool.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
- Let's go!

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
- In the lead
after dominating all night,

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
but wait, no, 96--

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
here it comes
around the outside!

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh, yes!
96 takes it!

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
- Look at him go!

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
- Let's go, Matthews!

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Sound of wind
it takes the sky

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
against the sky

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
- Can't believe
you know this guy.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
- Matthews?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
- 'Sup, dude?
- The star!

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
- Whoo!

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
- You, that was crazy.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
- Wow, hi, wow.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
- Oh, this is Bailey, Veronica.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
They're two criminals
we picked up

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
at the diner after the car they
stole got repoed by the cops.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
- Hey, I'm Kira.
Is that real?

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
- Yeah, kind of.
- No, no, not at all.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
We're not criminals
in the slightest.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
It was really
a misunderstanding,

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
and we actually really
have to get back on the road.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
- Where are you headed?
- Albuquerque.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
- So are y'all walking
to New Mexico or...

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
What?

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
No, can't walk to New Mexico.
What?

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
- Um, yeah, we're trying to get
to the bus station in Amarillo,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
and they said
that you might be headed there.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
- I generally try not
to associate with fugitives,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
but sure.
What the hell?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
- Oh, thank you, wow.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
- Right on--I gotta go
drive a monster truck

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
over a pile of flaming Priuses.
Meet me at the funhouse in 45?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
- That'll be fun.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
You know, funhouse.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
- J, you wanna help me gas up?
- Sure.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
- Thanks, see you.
- Bye.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
- Well...

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
It was nice meeting you.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
I'm sure I'll see you two
on "America's Most Wanted."

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
- Not unless we see you first
on "American Idol."

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
'Cause the singing.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Bye.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Hello?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
- Oh.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
of her hand

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
as fast as you can

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
- Can I ask you something?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
- Mmm, this Twinkie
is so great.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
- Hold on, hold on.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
We didn't get to finish
our discussion.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Okay, did you really not make
an appointment for tomorrow?

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Oh, my God, Veronica,
this is insane.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You have this whole trip
scheduled down

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
to an inch of its life,
yet no appointment.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
- What are you doing?

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
What?
No, no, no, no, no.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
- Stop, stop.
- Bailey, please don't.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Bailey, Bailey--
- Hello, hi.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Yes, this is Veronica Clarke,

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
and I'm in need of--

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
I'm in need
of an abortion tomorrow please.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Yes, I have taken
a pregnancy test,

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
and it's positive.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
About seven, eight weeks.
I'm not sure.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
It's pretty early.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
- What?
What are they saying?

46:53.000 --> 46:53.000
What are they saying?
- Oh.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
- What are they saying?

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
- Oh, I'm eligible
for a pill instead of surgical.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Oh, I'd need to come back
for a follow-up?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Dang, nope, can't make
two separate appointments,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
so I guess surgical it is.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Yes, I do have someone
coming with me

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
to my appointment actually.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
She's amazing,
and actually super smart

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
but doesn't brag about it.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Just, like,
this majestic human--

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
yes, ma'am, sorry, sorry.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Okay, what's the earliest
I can get?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
8:00 a.m.?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
- Um...

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
yes, yes,
that's perfect.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
- Okay, I'll take it.
Okay, thanks.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Today was nuts, and I kind of--
I don't know.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Just the call made it real.
My heart's racing.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
- Yeah, my heart's racing too,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
but I think it's from
the deep fried Twinkie.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Also it's not that crazy.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Like, one in four women
get them.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
- Yeah, no, I know.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Just it's a surgery
at a clinic with doctors.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
It's a whole thing.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Anyways...

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
is there something else
you maybe wanna talk about--

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
that whole Kira thing?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
- Oh, look, a ride.
Let's do it, come on.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
- Wait, Bailey.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
It seems like maybe you like...

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
the Slinger, but you're
just nervous about it?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
- I'm not nervous
about the Slinger.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
I just don't
wanna talk about it.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
- But you do like the Slinger?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
- Oh, my God, Veronica,
yes, I like girls, okay?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Is that a problem?

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
- No, no, not at all.
That's--it's great.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
I just--I didn't know.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
- There's a lot of things
you don't know.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
- I mean, I'm honored
to be the first person

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
that you, like,
came out to.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Bitch, what?

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
I've been out to my mom
for, like, years.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Like, five of my cousins,
my entire "X-Files" fan forum,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Doug from the bank.
- Okay, okay, I get it.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
- Does your dad know?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
- Oh, um, we haven't
really been

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
keeping in touch much lately.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
It's not really his fault.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
He's just really busy
with his plant store stuff.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
- How long have you known?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
- Since Tammy Clannahan
and her shiny hair

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
in fifth grade, I guess.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
- Tammy clammy hands?

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Why wouldn't you
have told me that?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
- Do you want everyone in town
to know you're pregnant?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
- No, but I think--
- No, same thing.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Church, gossip,
it's a shit show,

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
and I don't really
wanna be a part of it.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
- Oh!

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
- Oh, my God!

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
- I like girls!
- Yeah, you do!

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
- Yes, I like girls!
- Whoo, man!

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Oh!

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
- The first time I masturbated

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
was to Emma Watson
in "Deathly Hallows"!

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
- Part one or part two?
- Part one, obviously!

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
- Oh, my gosh!

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Oh, my God!

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
- Oh!
-

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Oh, man, oh!

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
- I'm pregnant!
- Hell yeah!

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
- Yeah, I'm pregnant,
and I'm getting an abortion!

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Yes!

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
We're gay and pregnant!

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
- We are gay,
and we are pregnant!

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
- We're gay and pregnant!

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
- Okay, there's a bus
that leaves in an hour,

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
which will get us
into Albuquerque at 9:00.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
How are we gonna get there
by 8:00?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
- Hey, there.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Sorry to interrupt, but we
couldn't help but overhear.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Are y'all looking for a ride
down to New Mexico?

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
- We're headed to Albuquerque.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
- Um...

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Yes, yes, actually, we are.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Hi, I'm Veronica.
This is Bailey.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Our car just broke down,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
and we've
really been scrambling

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
to get our butts there.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
- Wait, you guys
are headed to Albuquerque?

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
- Yep, we are going
to see my mother...

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
- That's right.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
- But when we saw
this carnival,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
we just had to stop.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
- I mean, we wouldn't wanna be,
like, a burden to you guys

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
or anything.
We don't have money really.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
- Oh, no, no, no,
hush, please--

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
if one of our daughters
was stranded,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
we hope someone
would do the same thing.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
- Yes.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
- Just hope you guys are okay
with this one singing

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Peter, Paul, and Mary
the whole darn trip.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
- Wow, you guys are a godsend.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
- Oh.
- Hey, guys.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Truck's out back.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
- Um, hey, we actually won't be
needing that ride anymore.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
- Yeah, found people
to take us the whole way there.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
- Oh.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
- So we'll bring the car
around front

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
and meet you in 15?
- Great, thank you, guys.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
You're amazing.
Thank you.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
- Thanks.
- Bye.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
- I'm gonna go pee.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
You know, long ride
and everything.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
- You wanna go check out
the funhouse

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
before you gotta go?

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
- Oh, yeah, I'll do that, yeah.
It was nice meeting you.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
- I meant with me, you weirdo.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
I was walking
through icy streams

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
through westward water

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
an old me

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
I'm inhaling

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
- Oh, my God,
I'm stuck.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Oh, oh.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Um...

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
- Would it be okay
if I kissed you?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
- Well, I just--
- I'm sorry.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
No, it's--we don't have to.
- No, no, no, no, no.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I'm just warning you
that I might be,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
like, kind of bad at it.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I've never really
done it before.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
- That's okay.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
there's air in between

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
I'm exhaling

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
there's air in between

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
- Thank you guys again
so much for the ride.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
- Oh, of course, honey.
We're so happy to help.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
So what's got you two
headed to Albuquerque anyway?

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
- Um--
- My dad lives there.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
- Oh, you must be excited
to see him.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Wait, for real?

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
Are we not taking
the I-40 the whole way there?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
According to the maps,
it says--

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
shoot, my phone's about to die.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
- The 40 gets crazy
toward Amarillo,

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
so just taking a shortcut.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
- Here, I can charge
your phone up here.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
- Okay, thank you.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
- Veronica, Veronica,
Veronica, wake up.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
- Where are we?

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
- Dude, I gotta piss so bad,
I can almost taste it.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Where the hell are we?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
- Maybe we're just outside
of Albuquerque,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
and this is their stop?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
- You're going in there?
- Yeah.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I mean, they're nice people,
and we gotta get back

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
on the road, so...

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
- All right, well,
looks like the house

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
from the Conjure-verse,
but all right.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Hello?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Hello?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
- Beauties, ain't they?

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Oh, oh.
- Hi.

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
- Paul, Joseph, Sarah, Rebecca,
Mark Junior, and Mary.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
- Don't let him fool you girls.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
When they were younger,
he needed a cheat sheet

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
to keep 'em all straight.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
- Of course, the doctor told us
Joseph would be our last one,

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
but then, just when we got
the last one out of the house,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
he delivered our final miracle.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
- Yep, shows you
what the doctors know.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
- That's right.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
- I'm sorry, but where are we?

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
- This is our home.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Oh, we tried to tell you,
but you were fast asleep.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
I hope you don't mind.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
It was on the way,
so we figured we'd stop

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
and have some breakfast.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
- That's really sweet
of you guys.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Thank you, but we really
don't have much time, so--

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
- I hope you like pancakes.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
- Let's join hands.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Lord, thank you
for this bountiful meal

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
we're about to receive,
and thank you

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
for our new, special friends.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
We appreciate your guidance
and thank you

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
for entrusting us
to spread your word.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Amen.
- Amen.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
- Amen.
- Oh, man.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
- So, girls--

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
- Actually--I'm sorry--
I need to use the restroom.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
- Oh, top of the stairs,
first door on the left.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
- Thanks.
- You bet.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Mother, you have outdone
yourself with these flapjacks.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
- Oh.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Can you believe it?
I forgot the coffee.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
Mark, can you be a dear
and put the kettle on?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Orange juice, Veronica?

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
- Um, no thanks.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
- Awfully kind of you
to accompany your friend

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
all the way to New Mexico.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It's a big hike from Missouri.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
- Yeah, I know, but she
would do the same for me.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
- Oh.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
- Sorry, I don't remember
telling you

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
we were from Missouri.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
- Oh.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
I should be honest.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
I have a bit
of a confession to make.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
You see, at the carnival,
Mark and I,

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
we couldn't help
but overhearing your friend

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
making you that appointment.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Now, there's no need for alarm.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
It's just we were so overjoyed
when we heard that God

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
had given you
this miracle of life.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
- You know, I think
it's kind of that time

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
where we should get
back on the road,

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
so would you mind giving me
my phone back, please?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
- What are you hoping for?

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Boy or a girl?
- Neither.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
- Okay, but if you had to pick.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
- I don't know--
girl, I guess,

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
but thank you for charging--
- Oh, a little girl.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
Oh, I just think
that you and Kevin--

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
that you would be
such wonderful parents.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
- Did you just say "Kevin"?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
- Your loving boyfriend.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
He called
while you were napping.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
- Hello, Bailey.
-

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
- No--
Mark!

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
- We need to get out of here!
- I'm aware!

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
- Wait.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
- Wait!

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
- Are they already
speaking in tongues?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Oh, my God.
- Oh, catch.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
- Got it.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
- Don't you start that vehicle!

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
- Eat me, straight lady!

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
What the hell is that?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
- Drive!

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Oh, my God, oh.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
- Girls,
why don't we pull over

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
and we'll talk about it

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
in the crisis
pregnancy center.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
We just like to help women

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
make smart,
educated decisions.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
- This is why you
always choose the ride

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
from the hot lesbian!

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
- Oh, man.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh!
-

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
- Sorry.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
- Oh, my gosh, a fence!
There's a fence!

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
- We just wanted to give you
some medical advice.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Did you know
that having an abortion

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
could result in you

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
not being able
to get pregnant in the future?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
- That's not true!
I Googled it!

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And, frankly, that's
a very problematic falsehood

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
to be spreading!

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
- Dead cows?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Gross.
- I don't like it.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I don't like it.
- Gross.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
- Oh, my gosh!

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
- Here we go!

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
- No.
-

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
- Huh.
- Are you okay?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
- Yeah.
- I think we lost him.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
That was incredible!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
- I'm like Vin Diesel
behind the wheel.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
- That's Kevin's
favorite actor.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Oh, gosh.
Oh, what do we do?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Um....

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
We have to do something.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
- Let's keep going.
- What?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
- I'm kidding!

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I'm doing a "Thelma
and Louise" thing.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
We're not driving off a cliff.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But maybe--maybe he doesn't
have to know that.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
- Oh.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
- Oh--oh, come here!

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
- What do we do?
- Wait.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
- Oh, darn it.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Darn it, darn it, darn it!

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Honey,
there's been an accident.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I don't--uh, girls?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
You all right?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I don't know.
I gotta check.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I'll call you.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
- All right, let's go.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
- Guys, I think this was
a misunderstanding, you know?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Look, we both
said some things, okay?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
- We're dying.
I need food.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I need water.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
- I haven't posted
in, like, ten hours.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
- That's what
you're worried about?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
We're gonna starve
out here, Veronica.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'd take one of those pancakes

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
from Karen and Mike Pence
at this point.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
- Ugh, she didn't even charge
my freaking phone.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
- Still got some juice.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
No reception though.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Could really use one of those
printed maps right now.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
- Wait, we can--
- Whoa, whoa, that's it!

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
We just hop the train
like old-timey hobos!

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
- Yes, okay, let's go.
- Yes!

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
- Are you allowed to say hobo?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
- It did feel weird
when I said it!

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
- Okay, here's the plan!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Jump, grab on, hold tight!
- Got it!

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
- We jump on three!
- Okay.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
- All right, okay.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
One...

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Two...

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Three!

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
- Trains go fast.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
- This is a joke.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
This is a joke.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I shouldn't be here.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I should not be here!

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I should be able
to just walk down the street

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and open a door
and waltz right in

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
and say, "Hello,
my name is Veronica.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
"My boyfriend is an asshole.
Here's my $500.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
"Oh, oh, yes,
I would love a cup of water.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
"Thank you so much.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
That's so sweet of you."
But no.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Nope!

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Instead I literally

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
had to drive 996 miles,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and now I'm stranded
in this freaking field

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
in the middle of nowhere,
and the train--

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the stupid train
won't slow down!

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Why in the hell

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
do you need
to get parental consent

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
to have an abortion, but not to
actually birth a human child?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Ugh!

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Fuck you,
Missouri State Legislature!

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
- Veronica.
- What?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
- There's a bus stop in
that town with our name on it.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
- Oh.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, we're 3 1/2 hours away,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
and your appointment's
in 30 minutes.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And my phone died.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Not great.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
- Hello.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Hello?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
- Bailey, come here!

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Hello?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Mitch, we need a limo!
- Dude, it's closed.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Come on.
- There's someone in there.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Mitch!

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Oh.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
- Who sent you?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
- Um, I'm sorry to bother you,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
but we really need
to get to Albuquerque.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
- All right, come on in.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Come on.
Come on.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
- Um...

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
- What's in Albuquerque?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
- Actually, it's kind of
a personal thing.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
- Tell me why you came here.
- She needs an abortion.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
- Where'd you say
you come from?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
- Missouri.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
The law there
won't let me get one

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
without my parents knowing,
so we had to go

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
all the way to New Mexico.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
- Ha!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Big government
thinking they can tell people

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
what they can and cannot do
with their bodies.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It makes me sick.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
They want us to suckle
at their teat,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
drink their fluoride water,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and brush our teeth every day
like little cogs

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
in their machine.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
- Do you not brush--

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
- How much money you got?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
- Uh, we can pay you...

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
$600.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
- I'll pull a limo around.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
- Ah, yes, thank you, Mitch.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
- Mitch is a decoy.
Name is Bob.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
- Oh.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
- Oh, my gosh.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Is that the first limo
ever made?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
- Wow.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
'fore the sun comes up

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
- You know, some people
take a limo to prom.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
We take it to an abortion.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
- Well, I took
a limo to prom too.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Okay, so when I
called the clinic,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
they only had
two appointments left--

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
a 10:00 a.m. and a 1:00 p.m.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Obviously we have
to make the 10:00 a.m.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
or we won't
make it home in time,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and my parents will find out,
which would suck.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
- Aw, you called
all by yourself?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
My little V's growing up.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
- Stop!

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
but it was all pretend

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
since you been gone

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
hear me say

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
with you

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
you'd ever hear me say

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
for the first time

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
now I get

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
- You know what?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
- Yeah!

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
- Wait!
Wait, stop!

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Wait.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
for the first time

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
yeah, yeah

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
for the first time

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
- New Mexico!

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Whoo, whoo!

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
- Hi, guys.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
- Stop studying and come over.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
- Yeah, come over.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Kaylee finally
solved the mystery.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
- Wh-what?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
- Okay, hear me out.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's Bailey Butler.
- Isn't that crazy?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
- You know, it's gotta be.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Everyone else denied it,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and someone saw her
by the dumpster.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Plus it's always the loners
who are secretly

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
having tons of freaky sex
with other weirdos.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
- What do you think, Ronnie?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
You know her best
out of anyone.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
- I-I don't know her that well.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I don't know why
you guys keep saying that.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
- Everything okay?
You sound weird.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
- Do you think it was her?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
- What do you think, Ronnie?
- Come on, is it her?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
- Yeah, yeah,
probably you guys are right.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I mean, she seems lonely
so maybe she's, like,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
hooking up with random people.
Who knows.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
- Oh, my God, that's so sad.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
- Yeah, I actually--
I have to go,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
but I'll talk
to you guys soon, okay?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
- Bye.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
- Wow.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I'm so stupid.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
- Bailey.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I just--you know

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I had to say something.
- Bob, pull over!

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
- What was I supposed to say?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Bailey--Bailey, come on.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Come on,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Can you just talk to me please?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
It was just
a stupid phone call.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
- Clearly you were
bullshitting me

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
this whole time!

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
- No, I was covering.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
If anything,
I was bullshitting them.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
- Oh, well, if that's true,
that's even worse.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
You like me,
and you still sell me out?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
You don't even defend me?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
You would do literally anything

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
to just maintain
this fake, perfect image

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
of yourself you created.
- That's--

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
- You used me for a ride,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and then you talk
trash about me.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
You lie
to your own best friends

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
about your abortion?
- It's complicated.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
- Why can't you just tell them,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
huh, if you guys
are such besties?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
- Look, I'm not,
like, the type of person

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
that's just supposed
to go and get an abortion.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Veronica, you are
exactly the kind of person

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
who gets an abortion
and then doesn't tell anyone.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
The same kind of person

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
who would just drop
their best friend on a dime.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
- Do you know why?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Did you ever think about why?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
- Yeah, yeah, you know, I had
a lot of time to think about it

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
when I was sitting
in the lunchroom

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
alone every day.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
- You know, you made it
so hard to be your friend.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You--you just wanted
to get in trouble,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and then you'd make fun
of me because I didn't,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
and you made me feel
like a loser for caring

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
about school, and it was like
you were--you were mad at me

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
for doing well and being happy.
I don't know.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
It was--God, and then,
remember when I invited you

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
to my 14th birthday, and you
snuck in a bottle of amaretto

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and puked all over
my birthday cake?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
- No one likes carrot cake.
- I do.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You--you changed, Bailey.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
- Yeah, because my parents
were getting a divorce.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I'm so sorry that I couldn't be

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
happy and perfect
for you all the time.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
- I never needed you
to be perfect.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Just, like, normal.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
- Veronica, you know what?
Go back to your car.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Go to your appointment.
Stick to your beloved plan.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
- Please don't do this.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Bailey...

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
You know that I need someone
there with me at the clinic.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
- Someone?
- Okay--

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
- Are you serious right now?
- That's not what I meant.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
- That is exactly
what you meant.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
- No, it isn't.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
- I am only here
because you need "someone."

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Well, Bob--Bob is someone,
right?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
So why don't you
just go with him?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
You know what, Veronica?
You have a super fun abortion.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Snap a pic for the gram.
- Screw you!

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Okay, Bob,
let's get out of here.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
- Ain't nothing to worry about.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
- How long is this gonna take?
- Two clicks past 0800 hours.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
20, 30 minutes.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
- Ugh!

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Bob, can we just make
a quick stop?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
- Hey, what's up
with that drink?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
- Oh, yeah, I know it's weird,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
but, surprisingly,
it's really good.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
- No, I know.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Another girl came in,
and she made me try hers.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
- She got
this exact same drink?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
- Yeah, exact same.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
- The half blue raspberry,
half cherry

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
with a squirt of coke?
- And a squirt of coke.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Yeah, yeah, what--is it like

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
a meme or a challenge
or something?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
- Um, uh...

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I can breathe
for the first time

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
- Bob, Bob, she came!

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
She came.
She's here.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
She's here somewhere.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Wait, but if she came for me,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
then why wouldn't she
have called me?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
- Why else would she be here?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
- We gotta go, Bob.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Oh, I found it.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Okay, in 2.3 miles,
you're gonna make a left.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
- Yeah, but if we go, you're
gonna miss your ten hundred.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I mean your
10:00 a.m. appointment.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
- It's okay.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
- Look, she seems
like a tough kid.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
I'm sure whatever it is,
she'll be fine.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
- That's a pretty plant.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Are you gonna help your mom
plant it?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Yeah?
Well, thank you so much.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Have a nice day.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
- Welcome to Butler's.
May I help you?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Bailey.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
- Hey, Dad.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
- What are you doing here?

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
- I don't know.
Just passing through.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Thought I'd, uh, come say hi.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I thought since I'm here,
we could, like,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
go get dinner or something.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
- I wish you had called ahead.
I'm a little busy right now.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
- Yeah, no, yeah, you're right.
I should have called.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I don't know.
I just thought--

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
- Always were too impulsive.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
- Yeah, right,
like, crazy Bailey?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
What's she gonna do
next, you know?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Oh, a rock, ooh, ha, ha.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Ah, whoa.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
- Do you need money?
Is that why you're here?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I've sending your mother
checks when I can,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
but it's slow time of the year,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
and I'm just trying
to make ends meet as it is.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
- No, no, Dad, that--

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Look, I'm sorry.
I should have called.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
You're right, and I'm--

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
- Give your old man a heads up
next time, will you?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
- Right, right, yeah.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
See you, I guess.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
- Are--are you kidding me?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
- What the hell
are you doing here?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
- Veronica Clarke?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
- I'm sorry, I just--

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
she drove hundreds
of miles to see you,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and you won't even go
to dinner with her?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
- Please don't do this.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
- You think that being a father
is just sending

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
a few checks a year,
and that's that?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
- I don't need
to explain myself to you.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I never expected
any father of the year awards.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Your mother wanted kids,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
and I wanted
to be with your mother.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Seemed like a fine trade-off
when the relationship

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
was going all right,
but as that faded,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
what was I left with?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
- What were you left with?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Do you--do you know anything
about this person right here?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Do you know that she speaks
three different languages

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
and somehow knows the lyrics
to every single song ever made?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And she is fearless.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
You're fearless--especially
behind the wheel

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
of a GMC Yukon.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
You're not just missing out
on knowing your daughter.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You're missing out on knowing
one of the most unique,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
passionate, incredible
human beings

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
on the face of the planet--
- All right, that's enough.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You're both young.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
When you grow up a little,
you'll realize

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
that you don't always get
what you want in life.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I think you should go.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
- What are you doing?
Oh--

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
- Okay, we gotta go!
We gotta go!

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
We got to go right now!
- I didn't kill him!

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I didn't kill him--did I?
Did I?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
- You're a freak.
Who does that?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
What, what, what?
- Wait.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Not just for the fight today
but for the last four years.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I-I never thought about it
from your perspective,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and I don't know how I'm
gonna make it up to you.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
- Well, tasing my dad
was a good start.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Whoa, what about
your appointment?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
- I had to come find you,
so I'm taking the later one.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
You chose me over risking
your parents finding out?

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
You goddamn idiot,
that is so nice!

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Okay, let's go!
Let's go!

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
- Do not tase them, okay?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I know that's
your instinct right now,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
but it's just not a great idea.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
- Girls...

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
If friendship
weren't a construct

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
designed to tie one down,
well, then I'd say

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
you two would make
awfully fine friends.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
- Thanks for everything, Bob.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
- No, thank you, Victoria.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
- Oh, Veronica.
-

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Are you serious?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
- Okay, I thought
it was too late.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I really need to talk to you.
- No, mm-mm.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
- I got this.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
- Okay, I'm gonna
go sign you in.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
- How--how did you even know
that I was here?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
- That Kate lady that you
stayed with in Texas,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
she told me--

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
seems super dope,
a little intense.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I thought you two were gonna
be here, like, hours ago.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
- Yeah, well,
it's been a long trip.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
You do know that you can't
stop me from doing this.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
- No, listen, I know,
and you're right.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Okay, this isn't about me
wanting a baby.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I want you, okay?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I still wanna be with you
even though you're doing this.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
- I appreciate that.
I do.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
But right now, I would just
prefer it if you weren't here.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
- Are you kidding me?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I was just, like, so nice.
- Excuse me?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
- Well, what do you
want from me?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
You know, I said I'm sorry,
like, five times already

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
about the condom thing
or whatever, okay?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I'm here to comfort you
in your time of need,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and it's like
you don't even realize

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I had, like, three other things
going on this weekend.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It's like you don't even
wanna be with me at all.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
- You're totally right.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
- What?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
- I've been unsure
for a long time,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and that's unfair to you,
and I'm sorry

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
'cause you've been
a really fun boyfriend,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
but you are not the person

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
that I wanna be with
for the rest of my life.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
- I don't think you can
hear yourself right now,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
but you sound crazy, okay?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Maybe, like, the baby fluids
are working their way up

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
to your brain
or something like that?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Like, I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But what I do know is that this
isn't really what you wanna do.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
- No, it is.
It absolutely is.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Come on--am I
really the person--

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
- Know what?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Either we stay together,
or I tell everybody at school

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
about your top-secret abortion.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
- You know, go for it.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I don't care.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Fine, I will.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
You know what?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
It was gonna be a surprise,
but my dad bought me a Jet Ski

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
for graduation, and now you're
never gonna step foot on it.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
- Wow.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
- Veronica Clarke?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
We actually can't have
your friend back there.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
So sorry.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
- Oh, is--is that okay?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Here you go.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
What happens next?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
- You can relax.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
We're just gonna talk
for a few minutes.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
- Okay.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
- I have a few questions,
and then I'll walk you

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
through the entire process.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
No surprises.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
First, is this your decision?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Have you been coerced
in any way?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
- No.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I mean, yes, yes,
this is my decision.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I want to do this.
- Okay, good.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You have a choice
between local anesthetic

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
or sedation.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Basically, during surgery
you can be numb or awake

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
or asleep.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
- I can be asleep?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Then, yes, definitely--
definitely that option.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
- Okay, good.
Final question.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Do you have someone
to take you home?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
- Yeah, my friend.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
- Okay, great,
you're doing wonderful.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
So here's the plan.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
First you'll change
into your gown.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Warning--it's not cute.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Then you'll get
a vaginal ultrasound.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
It's not fun,
but it doesn't hurt,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and you don't have to look
at the monitor

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
if you don't want to.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Next we'll draw some blood,
and we'll hook you up

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
to an IV.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Then you'll sit
with other women

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
who are waiting for surgery.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And then
to the surgical suite.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
The anesthesiologist
will place a mask

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
on your face, and you'll
be asleep in seconds.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
The doctor has a wand
that he'll insert inside you

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and remove the fetus.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You'll be in and out
in under ten minutes.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
You'll wake up

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
in the recovery room
safe and sound.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And that's it.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
- Can I tell you something?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I'm honestly pretty nervous.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
- That's okay.
It's normal.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And I have a feeling
you're gonna do just fine.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
- You're alive!

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Oh, they wouldn't
let me see you,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
so I just assumed
you were dead.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
- Aw.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Nope, I'm fine.
- How are you feeling?

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
- Relieved.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And hungry.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
- Food?
Okay.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
- Mm-hmm, while I was out,
I had them put in an IUD,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
so...

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
- Oh, so our last
abortion road trip, huh?

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
- I know, bummer, right?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
So when are we gonna talk
about the fact

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
that we have, like, $20
and no way to get home?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
- Yeah, I know.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I just have to make
a quick phone call.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
- Yeah, I should probably
make one myself.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Mom?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Hi.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
- I got Fil's car impounded.
- I need your help.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
- Well, um, this is me.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
- Yeah, that is your house.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Well...

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
- Thank you for...

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
coming and, you know,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
doing all that stuff.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
We don't have to, like,
say a big good-bye or anything.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I mean, school's tomorrow.
I'll see you there, so...

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
- Yeah, no, I know.
You're right.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Okay, see you.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
- See ya.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
- Hey.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Come sit.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
- I know you're mad.
I can I just say something?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I don't feel bad
about the abortion.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I feel like I'm supposed to,
but I don't.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I know I made
the right choice for me.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I just, I...

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'm really scared
that you're gonna hate me.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
- Hate you?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Veronica...

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000
how could you
even think that?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
No, I love you.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But I'm not...gonna lie to you.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
The choice you made...

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
that's not something
I can just...

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
It's not the choice
I would've made,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
not the one your sister made.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I'm not sure I'll
ever understand it.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I'm sorry.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
What I know is
I love you, sweet pea.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I love you so much more
than all of that, okay?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
- Okay.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
- Ronnie, oh, my God.
We heard about everything.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
- Oh, you must be devastated.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
- Surviving a break-up
is brutal,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
but, like, you'll bounce back.
- Yeah.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
- Oh, did you hear?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Someone got busted
with a locker full of Adderall.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
How aggressive is that?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
And you know,
I've already looked into it,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
and I think that Connor
is at the top of my list

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
'cause of all--
- The pregnancy test was mine.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
- Wait, what?
- Oh, my God.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
- Yeah.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
- I can't believe you've
been dealing with this alone.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
- I haven't.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
- Hi.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
like two runaways

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
- Wait, where even are we?

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I thought we were supposed
to be going to Gas N' Gulp.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Oh, um, yeah.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
That's--that's not actually
where we're going.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
- Then where are we going?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
- Well, remember when you said
we could go to Roswell?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
- No, no--
- Yeah!

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
broken on the freeway

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
running like two runaways

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
make our way out

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
our way out

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
broken on the freeway

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
running like two runaways
