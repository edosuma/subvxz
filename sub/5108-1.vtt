03:49.920 --> 03:52.434

What did you want to tell me
that's so important it can't wait?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.588
Can you at least pay attention to me
when we're fucking?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.750
Hey, listen, shut your mouth, man.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.195
I do pay you attention, babe.

04:22.280 --> 04:28.435
Didn't we shave my name into your pussy
hair the other night, huh? That's attention.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.508
We'll finish off, yeah?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.715
Aw! Has he gone to sleep?

04:39.800 --> 04:43.395
Oh, shut up, man!
This ain't happened to me before.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.031
Oh... maybe once.

Hey, Chinatown!

06:36.360 --> 06:38.555
You still owe me that fuck,

06:38.640 --> 06:42.269
Now, your cousin said
if she couldn't pay, you would.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.432
So tomorrow,

06:45.520 --> 06:47.317
I gotta go work.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.870

06:51.560 --> 06:53.835
I remember that one chick.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.196
- I went back to her house, bruv.
- What happened?

06:57.280 --> 07:00.352
Her dad came home, innit,
so man had to jump out the window.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.876
I was running down the street in my
boxers and my socks. I was pissed.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.837
Oh, shit, you'd feel pissed...

07:05.920 --> 07:08.992
- Sorry, would you like to sit down?
- Thanks.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.356
You cool, blood?

08:27.440 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, I'm bless, man. You?

08:30.080 --> 08:32.275
Yeah, man.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.270
Do I know you, cuz?

08:41.360 --> 08:42.679
No, bro.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.876
Can't a man chat?

08:44.960 --> 08:47.315
Yeah, man, safe.
Talk, innit.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.117
It's not safe, though.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.352
What you move for? We're having a little
chat - I chat to you, you chat to me.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.874
What you getting nervous for?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.875
Just come out of jail, man.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.872
That shouldn't make you feel nervous.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.039
That should make you feel good.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.358
What'd you go in for?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.194
What'd you go in for, blood?!

09:20.880 --> 09:23.758
I don't wanna chat about it.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.070
Bet I guess what you went in for.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.549
Don't tell me, let me guess.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.598
I think you hurt someone.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.592
I'm thinking someone died.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.395
Like you killed them or something.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.358
You're a clever one,
ain't you, blood?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.435
I don't think you
stabbed no one, though.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.557
You don't look like the type.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.313
If you was gonna
do something to a bre,

09:52.400 --> 09:54.994
I think you'd use a baseball bat.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.753
- Low it, man. Low it!
- My fucking cousin, blood!

10:27.600 --> 10:30.273
What's this about, blood?
What's it about?

10:30.360 --> 10:33.875
You ain't gonna survive this day.
I guarantee it!

10:33.960 --> 10:36.428
Man's coming for you.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.954
Your mum, your family, everything!

10:39.040 --> 10:41.793
Who's coming?
Who's gonna hurt my mum?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.598
Who, blood? Who?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.116
Mum! Roy!

11:35.000 --> 11:37.958
Come from yout offenders?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.554
What you in for?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.073
Killed one yout.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.078
Don't feel you're big in here
just cos you killed someone.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.754
Enough man in here done that.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.196
Some of them man ain't even affected.
You get me?

11:53.040 --> 11:54.678
You are.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.069
I can see it in your eyes.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.877
Who gave you that black eye?

12:03.840 --> 12:06.593
Listen, blood, watch them man.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.600
See my man there?

12:11.680 --> 12:13.432
They don't get on.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.559
Trust me, don't let any of them see
you're weak, blood.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.632
You want something?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.631
You keep watching me.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.793
Whenever you and your boyfriend
are ready, you can see what go on.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.988
What's your dad's name, blood?

13:46.280 --> 13:48.157
Dunno. I ain't got one. Why?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.435
Cos, like, my mum
tried to introduce me

13:50.520 --> 13:54.229
to some broke-down yellow-teeth
waste man, yeah, called Cedric.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.869
And hear this - he's coming into my house
telling me about how he's my dad.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.952
But I'm like,
"You're not my fucking dad."

14:01.040 --> 14:04.271
He had that ting Michael Jackson
said he's got. He looked like a panda.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.954
I said, "Move from my house
with your polka-dot skin..."

14:07.040 --> 14:09.713
Why's he taking so long, man?

14:11.000 --> 14:11.955
Yeah!

14:12.040 --> 14:15.749
I swear my maths teacher
lives somewhere round here.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.751
And she's buff, blood.
I wanna fuck that.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.479
I could quote algebra
while I'm in the pussy.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.233
Q=Z means "Yeah!"

14:23.320 --> 14:26.790
Get me? Why do you think
she's always giving me As?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.838
You don't get As, blood.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.273
- Who don't?
- Fool.

14:31.360 --> 14:36.275
Don't get it twisted. Just cos I'm with you,
don't think I'm stupid. I got plans.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.713
Although I might have to bang
my English teacher as well.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.075
Who? Mr Randall? You batty...

14:44.160 --> 14:46.549
No, man. Shut up.
It's a woman, man. You know that.

14:46.640 --> 14:51.475
- Yo, blood, it's broad daylight, man!
- If you're shook, leave, innit.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.871
Yes, Ike.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.549

15:33.120 --> 15:35.315
That ain't fake, man.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.914
I'll give you six for both tings.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.309
What?
Six, blood.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.639
You know what? I'll throw in a piece
of yay each. You'll have to wait, though.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.915
I gotta go, bruv.
I got a mark-up booked, innit.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.389
Safe, man. We'll wait here.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.350
All right, later, you man.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.829
You man wait here.

Yeah, come we play this.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.957

- Tss!

16:12.040 --> 16:14.031
- What?!

16:14.120 --> 16:17.192
He said pass the controller.
You fool.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.475
Hey, I'm Arsenal, blood.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.349
Who was it?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.396

16:38.280 --> 16:40.919
So you understand
what I was saying to you before?

16:41.000 --> 16:41.910
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.798
Even my man had to
learn the hard way, you know.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.154
See this?

16:47.920 --> 16:51.071
Some fucker done that to me.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.993
You're all right.
I'm not into face-cutting.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.629
Something about the face
makes people too angry.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.473
But he was right to do what he did.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.597
I took the fucking piss like you are.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.755
You know what, blood?

17:11.359 --> 17:14.477
I don't even know
this Curtis brother. Hm?

17:16.319 --> 17:19.710
But he was trying to do his ting.
You understand?

17:20.880 --> 17:24.509
And Andreas here, he fucked up.

17:25.599 --> 17:29.309
And now us man,
we're trying to do our little ting.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.831
And you are fucking up.
You understand?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.912
- Yeah, bruv, but I was...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.798
Listen, we like you, blood.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.155
I like you.

17:44.680 --> 17:49.356
But I can't have you
making money off of my shit.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.873
- It's mine.
- I... I...

17:54.560 --> 17:57.757
Now you're gonna
have to learn, blood.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.310
Argh!

18:03.760 --> 18:05.830
Oh, fuck! Argh!

18:21.920 --> 18:23.751
Safe.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.714
Where'd you park?

18:35.800 --> 18:38.075
About three roads away.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.037
Come on, we'll have a walk.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.157
I've got to meet Jon and Vern
at the shop.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.312
You're one lazy cow,

18:46.400 --> 18:49.472

18:49.560 --> 18:51.471

18:52.960 --> 18:55.838
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.954

19:19.160 --> 19:20.752
Hayden!

19:22.440 --> 19:25.557
Promise me you're not gonna scream.
Promise?

19:25.640 --> 19:27.551
- Mm-hm.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.798
What do you want?

19:31.880 --> 19:36.431
Some bre attacked me when I come out.
Said people are gonna hurt me, my family.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.511
I don't want that.
I done my fucking time.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.149
- What'd you come to me for?
- Have you seen my mum anywhere?

19:42.240 --> 19:46.153
That was six years ago.
I haven't seen any of them.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.470
I haven't seen your mum
in, like, a year.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.314
- What about my brother? You seen him?
- No!

19:52.400 --> 19:55.710
Claire, you must know something.
Just tell me anything, please.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.870
Moony goes Central University.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.838
That's all I know.
Now just fuck off and leave me alone.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.277
I don't wanna get involved in any of this.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.709
- D'you want something?
- Mind your business.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.678
What?
Who the fucking hell are you?

20:14.720 --> 20:17.314
- Do you know him? Is he bothering you?
- Yeah.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.676
All right, jog on, bruv, yeah?
Do yourself a favour and fuck off.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.274
Hey, blood, don't fucking touch me!

20:23.360 --> 20:25.635
What part of me

20:25.720 --> 20:27.438
Sam, just fuck off.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.316
Sam? Fucking Sam?
Fucking Sam, yeah?

20:31.400 --> 20:34.995
She still has nightmares because of you.
She flinches if I move too quickly.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.914
- You fucking wrong 'un!
- I'm just talking to her. I've finished.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.594
- Leave it.
- I'm all right, mate. I'm all right.

20:41.680 --> 20:46.071
Like you said, you're finished, so do
yourself a favour and fuck off. Yeah?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.788
Go and get in the car, babe.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.791
You've had a squeeze.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.351
Hey, babe.

21:50.120 --> 21:54.398
Robert, you know we've got basic ethics
and understanding of law on Monday?

21:54.480 --> 21:57.358
I could really use some help
getting my head around it.

21:57.440 --> 22:03.197
Yeah, of course. Anything I can do. Give
me your number and I'll give you a call.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.508
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.038
Bye.

22:10.320 --> 22:15.030
- Don't think you're calling her.
- Of course not, babe. You're my girl, man.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.915
- So, how was your class?
- It was all right...

22:21.000 --> 22:22.718
Moony.

22:27.120 --> 22:31.113
- How the fuck did you find me, blood?
- I saw Claire.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.954
She said you went to that uni
and I just asked a few people.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.076
- A guy try bore me up today.
- So?

22:37.160 --> 22:41.039
He's telling me mans is gonna hurt my
family because of what happened to Trife.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.078
Don't mention his name.
You have no right to say his name.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.790
If it's you, if you're involved in this, I just
wanna tell you that I'm not on it, blood.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.394
I'm not on dem tings no more.
We was all young.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.472
I'm just about my studies,
money and my girl.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.439
If you're not on it, you know how I feel.
Do you know where I can find them lot?

22:58.520 --> 23:02.229
Just so I can tell them
I'm not into this beef ting.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.515
Saw Becky a couple of months ago.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.353
She works in that salon ting in Grove.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.318
Don't know where Alisa is, and Jay...

23:10.400 --> 23:15.110
You don't wanna see Jay. He ain't planned
nothing but he ain't forgotten you.

23:15.200 --> 23:20.274
Yeah? Why don't you give me his number
so I can tell him that I want this over?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.715
- Are you dumb, blood?
- Come on, man.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.110
What d'you mean, "Come on, man"?
Don't talk like we're fucking friends!

23:26.200 --> 23:30.512
You're any bre to me, understand? I ain't
forgiven you and I'm giving you nothing.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.956
Can you two leave,
or I'll call the police.

23:38.600 --> 23:44.789
Know why I'm studying law, blood? So
mans like you don't get out after six years!

23:44.880 --> 23:47.474
- Tell Jay I want to see him.
- Are you sure you want that?

23:47.560 --> 23:50.711
If I told Jay you're out,
you wouldn't need to look for him.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.598
He'll find you,
and he will want arms.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.232
Dickhead!

23:59.440 --> 24:01.112
It's a ball, but I suppose you can come.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.995
You'd have to dress up a bit, mind you -
I've had the best week.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.991
I don't want your fucking life story.

24:07.080 --> 24:11.676
I told my friends you've got the best shit
on the street, cos that's what Giles does.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.911
Put your fucking hand down, blood.
You're baiting me up, man.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.912
I'm not being funny,
but I've got a barbecue to go to.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.513
Oh, shit!

24:19.600 --> 24:21.079
Just relax, man.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.756
- Give me my shit before they come back.
- I told you to put your hand down.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.549
- Blood, if I had to run, yeah...
- Jason, don't be such a drama queen...

24:29.640 --> 24:33.076
What the fuck do you think...
You ain't getting shit, bruv.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.549
Oi! You! Stand by that pole! Now!

24:35.640 --> 24:40.509
Furthermore, yeah, take all your
fucking shit and put it in my bag, blood.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.433
What have you got on you, man?
What the fuck you got on you?

24:43.520 --> 24:45.351
Give me your fucking ring.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.477
Please! That's her engagement ring.
It's French 17th century.

24:48.560 --> 24:52.838
Shut the fuck up, man! Hurry up, blood.
Put the watch in the bag as well.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.514
Blood, hurry the fuck up
or I will shank you, man.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.990
Jay, just let us go. I'm a good customer.
I'll give you anything.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.277
You, blood? I don't need
your lickle business, man.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.875
You're anything to me, blood.
The amount of white man I get.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.077
What?
What, you think you're big, Giles?

25:09.160 --> 25:13.551
Show your yuppie girl you know where
to score to impress her? You're a pussy.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.950
Let me show you
what a little pussy you are, blood, yeah?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.231
Show me your titties.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.232
Before I murk your man.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.710
For goodness' sake,
just show him the titties!

25:33.360 --> 25:35.430
Run! Tammy, come on!

25:35.520 --> 25:38.478
Are you mad, bruv?
The fuck you doing, bruv?

25:41.280 --> 25:43.430
The fuck you doing, man?!

25:43.520 --> 25:45.556
Hold on, yeah?

25:46.720 --> 25:48.472
Hello? Jahvon.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.189
What you saying, man?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.072
What?

25:54.160 --> 25:56.993
Sam? What, at the cemetery?

25:57.080 --> 25:59.469
Where's he now?
Fuck him, blood!

25:59.560 --> 26:02.518
He's a dead man!
He's dead tonight.

26:02.600 --> 26:07.071
Nah. No, you go home, blood.
I'll get Moony and handle it.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.837
You better thank God
something else has come up.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.469
- Well, thank him, then!
- Thank you, God! Oh, thank you, God.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.755
Get out of here, man.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.151
Arsehole!

26:25.240 --> 26:27.276
Tammy!

26:45.440 --> 26:47.670
Max? Can I just...
please nip out for a?

26:47.760 --> 26:50.877
Make sure you wash your hands
when you get back in.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.913
Come outside.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.752
One second.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.592
Hey, cokehead!
Where's your fucking cousin?

27:09.680 --> 27:12.877
- Think I don't know what she tried to do?
- Fuck off. Is this a joke?

27:12.960 --> 27:16.748
It ain't no joke. My man showed me that
she tried to move to him at the drinks ting.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.717
And you were there skinning your teeth.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.553
You thought because I was on holiday
I'd forget about it?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.438
Listen, your man
pushed himself up on us, yeah.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.796
If your tings ain't tight enough
to keep his dick pointed at you...

27:27.880 --> 27:30.440
She ain't even fucking worth it.
Where is she?

27:30.520 --> 27:33.478
I don't fucking know where she is.
I don't care where she is.

27:33.560 --> 27:38.953
Forget this. Find your fucking cousin and
both you get back to whoring yourselves.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.600
What? You think I don't know about you?
Listen.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.591
We all know about you.

27:43.680 --> 27:47.753
Shiners for a fiver.
And you're fucking for a score.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.833
- I never did any of that.
- So what about for a bit of coke?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.753
Is that why I've heard
you've had all them dicks inside you?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.990
- You fuck... Ow!
- What you saying?

27:57.080 --> 27:58.718
Come off me, man.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.237
- What the fuck is going on?
- She flipped out and attacked me.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.995
Anna, Lisa, go to lunch. Now! Go. OK!

28:08.080 --> 28:09.991
Yeah, that's...

28:11.560 --> 28:17.317
Now, look, Lexi, I know you've been a bit
stressed. I want you to take a few days off.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.995
Please don't fire me! I need this job.
I can barely afford to pay my rent...

28:21.080 --> 28:26.108
I'm not going to fire you.
Come in on Tuesday. All right?

28:26.200 --> 28:30.318
Today I want you to go in there,
get your stuff, and go home.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.078
Sorry, ladies,
that will not happen again.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.474
Can I speak to Becky, please?

28:44.560 --> 28:47.836
What do you want her for?
Who are you?

28:49.040 --> 28:50.678
Jay.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.719
I don't wanna get involved, man.
I'm not scared.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.998
But I'm about positivity,
like that black Jedi guy from <i>Star Wars.</i>

28:59.800 --> 29:04.954
All right, I'll see you later. I'll see you
at Hammersmith later. I'll be there, man!

29:06.400 --> 29:09.551
- Robert, what is going on?
- Low it, babe, yeah?

29:09.640 --> 29:14.668
You don't remember me, do you?
Alex. Lexi, innit? Becky's cousin.

29:16.160 --> 29:20.756
There's no reason you should. I was
two years younger and you was a cunt.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.673
I left in year 11
while you was still in sixth form.

29:23.760 --> 29:28.754
Picking on boys
and trying to fuck girls in year 10...

29:28.840 --> 29:32.719
- So what d'you wanna see her for?
- I thought she might know who's after me.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.271
Yeah, she might, but I ain't seen her.
No one has. She's fucked off, innit.

29:37.360 --> 29:42.639
Look, yeah, I didn't know Trife well,
but... it's fucked-up he's dead.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.351
- So do you know anything?
- Why the fuck would I know anything?

29:47.440 --> 29:50.159
I know some of them lot from school
and through her,

29:50.240 --> 29:52.959
but not well enough to know
who's after you.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.838
Or to give a fuck for that matter.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.151
Well, that's it, innit?

30:02.240 --> 30:05.755
What else do you want me to say?
You've gone jail, come out - what?

30:05.840 --> 30:10.675
I ain't got nothing against you, but I don't
think we got anything more to chat about.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.876
Ask that girl you was banging,
they was mates.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.589
Claire? I asked that chick already.
She don't know nothing.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.955
That girl was grimy.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.475
Always losing her knickers. After lunch
she'd not know where she'd left 'em.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.269
I remember you now.
You was always on your own, innit?

30:27.360 --> 30:30.909
Yeah. My boyfriend went to a different
school, so I didn't chat with boys.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.150
Girls didn't like me, so...

30:33.240 --> 30:36.789
I got to the point where I did more things
to piss 'em off. You get me?

30:36.880 --> 30:40.270
Fuck it. If they ain't gonna love you,
make 'em hate.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.873
I beg you a browns, Lex?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.632
Who's your friend?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.154
No. He ain't a friend.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.913
Cool.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.155
Yout!

31:01.600 --> 31:04.831
- Safe for what you did, blood.
- I didn't do nothing, man.

31:04.920 --> 31:09.038
Listen, I ain't trying to be
spars with you, you know.

31:09.120 --> 31:13.830
You don't have to affiliate yourself
with me. I'm just saying safe, that's all.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.434
Don't worry about it, boys.
It gets better.

31:16.520 --> 31:20.798
I'm getting out tomorrow. Can't wait
to see my kids. You got any kids?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.235
Know anyone that's got any kids?

31:24.240 --> 31:25.958
Suit yourself.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.197
Oi, Lex! What about Alisa?

31:32.280 --> 31:35.033
You know some of them lot.
Can you get her to speak to me?

31:35.120 --> 31:40.069
I've not spoken to her but I could get her
number. You know she had a daughter?

31:40.160 --> 31:44.472
- Yeah. Can I have it?
- Her daughter? Oh, her number? No.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.711
I'll get to her, see if she wants
to chat to you, but I doubt it.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.633
I'm not high on the list of people
she wants to chat to either.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.598
Here what. I got my mum's mobes,
I'll give you the digits.

31:53.680 --> 31:57.514
I beg you bell mans
if she wants to speak or anything.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.949
Yeah, safe for doing this, yeah?

32:07.040 --> 32:09.759
Hey, can you get any gear and that?
Like, cheap?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.558
Nah, man.

32:12.840 --> 32:16.276
Oi, what's it like
knowing you've killed someone?

32:31.120 --> 32:34.590
Blood, I need that ting off you now.
I don't give a fuck.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.035
I want him dead.
I want him dead today.

32:43.440 --> 32:48.230
Kill my boy. Now he's back in the ends
like he's big and I'm not gonna do nothing!

32:48.320 --> 32:51.198
Just cool down, man.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.709
- I'll give you seven for everyting.
- Cool, man.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.635
- You gonna help me with this or what?
- Jay, man just got out of jail today.

33:04.720 --> 33:07.757
If something happens to him,
friends are gonna come for you.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.957
I don't care, blood. I'll go jail.

33:13.880 --> 33:18.510
You know what, I'm gonna give you
the piece, cos me and you are boys.

33:27.920 --> 33:31.276
Just don't bring no fucking drama
to my door, you hear me?

33:31.360 --> 33:33.271
Course not.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.148
You just gotta understand,
do you get me?

33:37.240 --> 33:40.437
This boy... killed my tight bredren, man.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.512
Listen, why don't you buy
a couple of the boys we got?

33:43.600 --> 33:46.637
They'll do anything for a bit of cash.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.837
Why don't you get 'em to do the job
for you, save you the trouble?

33:49.920 --> 33:52.514
- And if they get caught, who gives a fuck?
- Who?

33:52.600 --> 33:55.717
Don't put no pussyholes on it
who'll take my money and not do nothing.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.190
This lot won't fuck about,
they're a tight little crew.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.669
- Omen, Dabs, and some others.
- Omen?

34:01.760 --> 34:04.069
Yeah. You know him?

34:04.160 --> 34:07.835
Nah, not really.
Why? Is he here?

34:07.920 --> 34:10.559
Dabs is still here.

34:10.639 --> 34:14.076
- Go on, go through with Andre.
- Come on, then.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.719
Cuz, you're not on my level
on this game, man.

34:16.800 --> 34:20.315
Cuz, why do you think they call me
King Henry, bruv? Check out the header.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.630
Look-look-look! Bang!
Check out the replay.

34:22.719 --> 34:26.554
- Mine's stuck.
- Nah! Check out the replay.

34:26.639 --> 34:29.154
Hey, Dabs. Come through, mate.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.755
Now, man. Come on.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.716
Let me have that.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.750
Mum?

34:54.639 --> 34:56.835
How you doing, mum?

34:56.920 --> 34:58.831
Everything OK, like?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.716
Came out today.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.908
Did you do that

35:11.040 --> 35:13.873
Yeah. I'm s... I'm sorry.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.191
I just needed... I needed to get in.
No one was home.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.151
I mean, I'll pay for it.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.437
Gonna go try get a job.
I'll go Jobcentre or something.

35:23.520 --> 35:28.674
You know, cos we get taught stuff
in there. You can still get jobs and that.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.031
I missed you, mum.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.351
Some toast?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.788
Let me get this straight. You want me
to get Omen, find this yout and murk him?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.598
Yeah.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.555
- You sure you want him dead?
- Yes, man, are you deaf? Dead.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.313
- Why's he getting excited?
- Who the fuck you talking to?

35:51.400 --> 35:54.870
Look, let's just calm the fuck down.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.117
Can you do it or what?

35:59.200 --> 36:01.111
What's in it for me, like?

36:02.680 --> 36:06.309
Listen, I like the way
you been going on recently, blood.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.710
So what say you come flex
with me and Andre for a bit?

36:09.800 --> 36:13.998
Step up a bit, get a little piece
of what we're going on with.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.029
You better watch yourself.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.588
All right, man.
I'm sorry, man.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.477
Sorry, Ike, man.

36:22.560 --> 36:26.519
But come the fuck on. Kill a bre for just
that? You must think I'm any road yout.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.477
- I ain't doing that.
- Listen!

36:28.560 --> 36:31.279
I'll give you three grand now.

36:31.360 --> 36:35.319
And then three more when it's done.
I ain't chatting shit to you, all right?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.755
Take the money and go find him.

36:38.760 --> 36:43.550
- You know what? Seckle the fuck down.
- Blood, you need to watch your mouth!

36:50.160 --> 36:52.720
- Who is it?
- Name's Sam Peel.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.518
Sam Peel?

36:55.440 --> 36:58.113
- You do know that...
- Don't worry about what I know.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.272
- Yeah, but...
- You still gonna do it, blood?

37:04.400 --> 37:06.470
- Know what? Rag on.
- Good.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.074
And don't let the others know
who he is, blood.

37:09.160 --> 37:13.950
No, I mean it, blood. Don't even
let them mans see his face too tough.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.395
Just go get Omen
and do your fucking job.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.278
You see him, you kill him.

37:19.360 --> 37:23.194
- You do know what he looks like, yeah?
- Course, blood.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.271
He robbed me when I was nine.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.918
Yo, Henry!

37:28.000 --> 37:30.036
- We're gone, blood!
- Tss!

37:31.080 --> 37:34.629
Don't forget I've got the title, blood.
I beat you eight times.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.358
That's Henry the Eighth.

37:36.440 --> 37:40.353
What's wrong with these kids nowadays?!
They ain't got no respect, blood.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.670
Always on a hype ting.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.195
I didn't chat to my elders like that.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.236
Here you go.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.030
So what's going on?

37:56.920 --> 37:59.992
- They want us to kill someone.
- What?! Who?

38:00.080 --> 38:04.437
- I ain't supposed to tell you, blood.
- Come on, blood, I ain't gonna tell no one.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.238
- Sam Peel.
- Who's that?

38:06.320 --> 38:07.958
- You don't know?
- No.

38:08.040 --> 38:12.192
But you know what, cuz, it don't even
matter. I ain't into all that stupidness.

38:12.280 --> 38:14.953
You told them
it's all nonsense, yeah?

38:15.040 --> 38:17.873
You're thinking about it, innit?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.951
Blood, don't be stupid, man!

38:20.040 --> 38:23.271
When I tell Omen and Blammy
they're gonna laugh in your face.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.395
Tss!

38:24.480 --> 38:29.759
Ike and them must think we're dickheads.
If you're thinking of doing it, you're stupid.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.592
Who the fuck you calling stupid?

38:31.680 --> 38:34.319
Blood, you're a dunce
if you kill someone for them fools.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.709
Next man would do it twice
for that kind of Ps.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.756
Get off me, man.
I don't even care!

38:38.840 --> 38:42.799
I'm up for a little arms and robbing, man.
But you gone psycho, blood.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.792
You shot man last night and now this.
I'm not going jail for you.

38:45.880 --> 38:49.634
I'm not going jail for no one to call me
Abigail, call me some next man's chick.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.790
Burn that, man.
You can go, man. Fuck you.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.915
- Who the fuck are you talking to, blood?
- Get off me, cuz, yeah?

38:56.000 --> 39:00.790
Calm down. What's wrong with you? I'm
supposed to be your friend. Calm down!

39:18.200 --> 39:19.713
I'll catch up with you on Monday.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.235
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mum.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.675
- How was school today?
- All right.

39:24.760 --> 39:29.231
Mummy's just got to see someone for a
bit, but then we're gonna go straight back.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.519
OK, come on. Over here.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.709
- You all right?
- What do you want?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.870
Can I give you a lift home?

39:54.480 --> 39:56.994
- OK, I'm gonna be in in a minute, OK?
- OK.

40:00.040 --> 40:05.592
- Where'd you get my number from?
- She left her phone when she fucked off.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.875
- So what you up to these days?
- Being a mum.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.678
Safe.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.916
I'm just working in a salon, innit.
I wanna get into...

40:15.000 --> 40:17.833
What the fuck d'you want, Alex?

40:17.920 --> 40:19.399
It's Lexi.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.072
All right. Lexi.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.072
You bell me, say you want to
talk about something important,

40:24.160 --> 40:26.230
and now you're sitting
having a chitchat?

40:26.320 --> 40:30.632
I don't mean to be rude, but one of the last
people I wanna have a social with is you.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.199
Fine. Whatever.

40:32.280 --> 40:36.034
That guy Sam's out. Someone's after him.
He wants to know if you know anything.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.872
Well, I don't.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.235
Now tell me,
why the fuck should I even care?

40:40.320 --> 40:43.357
He deserves everything he gets.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.237
Come on, Alisa. He's done his time,
he doesn't want any trouble.

40:51.320 --> 40:56.189
So? I don't give a fuck about him
and I don't even know why I met you.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.514
Actually, do you know what, I do.

40:59.600 --> 41:03.991
I thought you were gonna tell me Becky
was hurt or homeless or something.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.390
I wanted to see if I felt sad.
And now you tell me she's missing.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.677
And do you know what?
I don't even fucking care.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.194
I don't care about her, you, or him.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.590
I don't even give a fuck either.
I just thought since he took time out

41:16.680 --> 41:21.959
to find me and... and to see Moony
and Claire, that at least I would pass on...

41:22.040 --> 41:24.031
- He saw Moony and Claire?
- Yeah.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.680
He just said his piece and left.
What harm can it do?

41:26.760 --> 41:28.876
All right. Call him.

41:28.960 --> 41:33.875
But if he so much as raises his voice
to me, I'm calling the police.

41:41.240 --> 41:45.279
You never came to see me.
Even when I was in hospital. Why?

41:46.200 --> 41:48.395
You...

41:48.480 --> 41:51.631
make me feel so shame.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.911
I couldn't bear it.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.755
More than one woman
lost their son that night.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.918
- Lord God. What did I do wrong?
- You did nothing wrong.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.516
I try to raise you on my own. I work every
hour God send me to provide for you.

42:09.600 --> 42:14.310
- And what do I get? You, a murderer.
- It's different from murder.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.153
And your brother.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.913
He's gonna be worse than you are.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.872
Maybe if I'd gone to church more.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.832
I never meant to let you down, Mum.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.070
You never meant to.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.312
But you did.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.668
I borrowed your phone.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.389
Whenever you're ready, pussy.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.438
Yout.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.513
Wha' gwan, blood?
What you got?

43:07.280 --> 43:11.193
Bre! I ain't had them crisp in time,
you know! Let me have your crisp.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.635
- Tss!
- What? You say something?

43:13.720 --> 43:17.554
Did you say something, blood?
Give me the fucking chocolate too.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.508
My man got 'nuff batteries.
What you need them for?

43:22.600 --> 43:25.433
- My shaver and...
- Nah, cuz! You don't need them.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.193
Give me your batteries.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.958
- I'm not giving you the batteries.
- What? You a bad man now?

43:36.040 --> 43:39.953
You kill someone big? What was his
name? Tell me. See if I get shook of you.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.871
- His name was Trife.
- What?

43:41.960 --> 43:45.839
- His name was Trife.
- His name was Trife. Don't know him.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.356
And you know what?
I'm taking your fucking batteries.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.518
You?

44:12.200 --> 44:13.315
Hello?

44:13.400 --> 44:14.833
- That Sam?
- Yeah.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.229
- It's Lexi.
- Yeah, what's going on?

44:17.320 --> 44:20.517
- Alisa said she'll see you.
- Where?

44:20.600 --> 44:24.070
Go Latimer Station, do a left
through the alley then bell me.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.878
Safe.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.753
What you doing, blood?
That's my chair.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.671
- I'm next.
- Did I say that's my chair?

44:37.760 --> 44:40.479
- I'm next.
- Shut the fuck up! I heard you first time.

44:40.560 --> 44:43.199
Oi! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

44:43.280 --> 44:46.352
Come out the fucking shop.
You trying to fuck a man's business?

44:46.440 --> 44:48.351
I'm coming back for him, you know.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.316
Yo, Omen.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.072
Wha' gwan, man?

44:55.160 --> 44:58.436
What's going on, man?
What happened to your lip?

45:00.400 --> 45:02.595
You know I'd do anything for you.
We like blood.

45:02.680 --> 45:05.319
Yeah, yeah, man. Course.
Tell me, man.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.392
Ike and Andre asked me to get you man
and kill some bre for six Gs.

45:08.480 --> 45:10.630
- What? What for?
- I dunno.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.790
Me and Henry said,
"Nah, we ain't on it,"

45:12.880 --> 45:17.317
then we saw the bre and thought, "Fuck it.
May as well rush him." He bricked Henry.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.437
I tried to fight my man
but he got away.

45:20.520 --> 45:24.399
- So where's Henry? Hospital?
- I had to kick out before the feds came.

45:24.480 --> 45:26.948
- You left Henry, blood?
- He was out cold.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.918
I chased the bre, called an ambulance,
got Blammy, came here.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.757
I was banging my yat. When Dabs called,
I just left her - legs up, gash out, everyting.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.229
Let me call Henry, man.

45:43.920 --> 45:47.754
Fuck this. Who's the bre?
I'll fucking do it. He's dead.

45:47.840 --> 45:51.913
Dunno. But I'll recognise him, though.
I'll fucking recognise him.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.993
- They said it's big tings for us, blood.
- You know what? Fuck their tings!

45:56.080 --> 45:58.435
If this bre hurt Henry,
he's fucking done.

45:58.520 --> 46:02.069
It's done. That's what I said.
Well, you on it or what?

46:02.800 --> 46:06.236
You done know. Come.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.591
Oi, Moons.
I swear I'm leave, like.

47:11.680 --> 47:14.194
I just thought I seen my man
walking like he's big.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.953
Nah. Nah, I'm coming to get you now.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.473
- What did she say, like?
- Alisa?

47:31.560 --> 47:35.553
Nothing. She just said bring him
and I said I'd sort it.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.949
Why are you helping me?

47:40.160 --> 47:42.913
- I saw Jay.
- What? When? What did he say?

47:43.000 --> 47:47.391
Nothing. Well, I thought it was him -
he was on the train, I wasn't.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.071
You all right?

47:53.160 --> 47:55.515
- Is her kid here?
- Yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.959
- What do you want? Find God in jail?
- I understand how much you hate me...

48:04.040 --> 48:07.316
You'll never understand
how much I hate you.

48:07.400 --> 48:12.315
I didn't plan this. I didn't know what I was
gonna do today, I just wanted to get out.

48:12.400 --> 48:15.676
But this guy attacked me and he's saying
people are gonna hurt my family.

48:15.760 --> 48:19.548
I wanna tell you that if you know who's
involved, I don't want any more trouble.

48:19.640 --> 48:22.632
- So this is about what you want?
- Come on, the guy's trying...

48:22.720 --> 48:25.518
Shut up, Alex.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.831
What about
all the people you've hurt?

48:28.920 --> 48:32.276
What about what they want?
What about all the lives you've ruined?

48:32.360 --> 48:35.318
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean it?

48:36.600 --> 48:38.511
Wait here.

48:42.760 --> 48:45.638
It's not going
the way you planned, is it?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.478
What?!

48:51.560 --> 48:53.869
Fucking prick!

49:02.720 --> 49:05.109
OK. Go play with your toys,
sweetheart.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.949
What about what she wants?

49:11.400 --> 49:15.313
Like a dad? Which she doesn't have
because of you.

49:15.400 --> 49:21.919
You think... I have time to sit around
and organise how to get you back?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.070
D'you know what?

49:27.440 --> 49:28.395
Mum?

49:37.640 --> 49:42.953
Don't you ever... come near me
or my daughter again.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.439
You either.

49:58.640 --> 50:01.234
What you doing now?

50:01.320 --> 50:02.673
I dunno.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.513
I know it sounds dumb,
but it was good seeing you today.

50:05.600 --> 50:08.956
It's good that you come out of jail,
and you're, like, all right.

50:09.040 --> 50:12.510
Bell me sometime, yeah,
if you're bored or whatever.

50:12.600 --> 50:17.549
Or if you're not doing nothing now, you
could just... go back to mine and just...

50:17.640 --> 50:19.517
just whatever...

50:19.600 --> 50:21.511
for a bit.

50:30.080 --> 50:33.038
- Any of these bres?
- Nah, man.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.998
- You heard this?
- Put it away, man.

50:40.520 --> 50:42.556
Fucking hell, man.

50:42.640 --> 50:48.033
Everywhere I go... Why the biggest guy
in the world always stand in front of me?

50:48.120 --> 50:50.588
Yo, blood!

50:50.680 --> 50:53.478
You get paid to follow me around
or something?

50:53.560 --> 50:55.676
What?
You wanna say something to me?

50:55.760 --> 50:59.196
You better chat slow, yeah, blood.
I don't speak Big Foot.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.876
- Hey, that's him. That's the fucking bre.
- Come we get him, then.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.875
Fuck round him
and knock him out.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.751
Hey, man! Hey, pussyhole!

51:12.840 --> 51:14.796
- Get the fuck up.
- Fuck up!

51:14.880 --> 51:17.519
Get the fuck up! Stand up!

51:17.600 --> 51:20.160
- I wanna see him.
- Fucking do it, man.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.753
Fuck!

51:21.840 --> 51:24.149
- That's not him, man.
- What?

51:24.240 --> 51:26.515
It's not fucking him.

51:26.600 --> 51:28.591
- Fuck!
- Might as well jack him.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.159
- Fucking come here.
- Come on!

51:30.240 --> 51:32.071
Shut up!

51:32.160 --> 51:34.549
Shut up. What? Shut up. Sing.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.790
- You deaf, pussyhole?
- Fucking sing.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.952
- # Let me go
- Fucking dickhead. Get out of here, man.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.871
I thought you knew
what the bre looks like.

51:43.960 --> 51:47.999
I do, man.
I just made a mistake, innit.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.398
It's Henry.

51:53.480 --> 51:54.993
Hello?

52:03.280 --> 52:05.316
What, blood?

52:05.400 --> 52:08.119
That was his mum.

52:08.200 --> 52:12.637
- He's not dead, he's just unconscious.
- So are we still gonna do this, or what?

52:12.720 --> 52:14.631
Yeah, come.

52:26.160 --> 52:30.073
Come in. We can have a fat spliff,
just cotch for a bit.

52:34.160 --> 52:37.789
It's small. Hope it don't
remind you of jail too much.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.235
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. What you got?

52:40.320 --> 52:42.788
Um... water.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.917
M-might have some Um Bongo
in the cupboard.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.191
What's that?

52:58.560 --> 53:01.870
Exzoryapan. It's, like, a...

53:01.960 --> 53:04.110
It's an antidepressant... thing.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.918
I get...

53:18.600 --> 53:21.353
So what you doing tomorrow, like?

53:23.280 --> 53:26.909
Why? That your way
of asking me to do something?

53:27.000 --> 53:30.436
No, man. I was just...
No. I was just asking.

53:30.520 --> 53:33.273
I never do nothing no more.

53:33.360 --> 53:36.033
Get up, go to work, come home.

53:36.120 --> 53:38.634
I spent six and half years
wishing I could do something

53:38.720 --> 53:40.836
and you don't know
what you're doing tomorrow.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.990
So what you doing?

53:43.080 --> 53:46.436
- Something, man. Anything.
- Exactly. You don't know.

53:47.360 --> 53:50.158
Well, what do you like doing?

53:50.240 --> 53:52.515
I draw designs sometimes...

53:52.600 --> 53:54.875
It doesn't matter. It's stupid.

53:55.560 --> 54:00.475
You know what? You're the first bre
that asked me what I like to do in years.

54:06.240 --> 54:10.313
- So where exactly is Becky, then?
- I don't know. She just up and left.

54:10.400 --> 54:14.188
Got home four weeks ago - gone.
I ain't seen or heard from her since.

54:14.280 --> 54:17.636
- You don't seem that bothered.
- No, I'm not.

54:18.960 --> 54:22.350
- I've missed this, man.
- What?

54:22.440 --> 54:27.958
Just cotching at a girl's yard, like. Just
little things, like going cinema and that.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.072
- Shit... Oh, sorry.
- Oh, fuck!

54:30.160 --> 54:32.549
Nah, it's all right.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.951
Come here.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.639
Come here.

54:53.080 --> 54:54.035
<i>Oi, Moons!</i>

54:54.120 --> 54:57.510
- What you saying, fam? You cool?
- No, I'm not cool. I'm vexed.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.990
I thought I see him on the train, innit?
I swear I'm going mad, blood.

55:01.080 --> 55:04.356
I wanted to spark him,
then I thought, "Let me calm down."

55:04.440 --> 55:08.558
Let me come get you and let's do this
together, blood, like it should be done.

55:08.640 --> 55:11.154
I got some little youts
looking for him as well.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.676
- Which way we going, man? It's that way.
- Relax. Come in for a chat.

55:14.760 --> 55:17.877
We ain't got time for no chat!
We need to go get him now.

55:20.360 --> 55:22.351
- Hey!
- Shut up, you waste man!

55:22.440 --> 55:24.510
You're all butters anyway!

55:24.600 --> 55:26.192
Bitch!

55:26.280 --> 55:28.555
Relax, Jay, man.

55:29.680 --> 55:32.956
Hey, blood.
What you wearing, man?

55:33.040 --> 55:37.591
You look like a fucking batty man, blood.
This better be for some uni project.

55:45.640 --> 55:48.791
Jay... this is my girl Kayla.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.795
Rah, blood!

55:53.680 --> 55:58.993
So I don't see you in a couple of months,
yeah, and you got yourself a girl, blood?

55:59.080 --> 56:02.675
Babe, check they didn't put no onions in it.
You know how you get.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.638
- Are we gonna go get him or what?
- What exactly is going on?

56:05.720 --> 56:09.838
- Robert ain't really filled me in.
- "Robert"?

56:09.920 --> 56:11.876
All right. Basically, yeah.

56:11.960 --> 56:15.873
This guy...
that killed our best friend...

56:16.440 --> 56:18.556
just come out of jail, innit?

56:18.640 --> 56:21.393
- And I want us to go get him back.
- And do what?

56:21.480 --> 56:23.948
Blood, what's this girl on?
What you think?

56:24.040 --> 56:26.634
- I'm not on it, bruv.
- What you talking about?

56:26.720 --> 56:29.678
- I'm talking about Sam.
- He said he's not interested.

56:29.760 --> 56:33.070
You speak for him now? Go suck out.
Who's talking to you anyway?

56:33.160 --> 56:37.073
I don't know who you think you're talking
to, but you don't speak to me like that.

56:37.160 --> 56:40.709
- Seckle yourself. Moony, tell your girl.
- Tell me what?

56:40.800 --> 56:44.315
Listen, this ain't a dictatorship, "blood",
this is a relationship.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.039
I'm a 22-year-old woman
who's studying law.

56:47.120 --> 56:50.476
He does not tell me nothing.
We discuss things together, yeah.

56:50.560 --> 56:54.189
Maybe if you was a man instead of a yout
in a man's body you would know that.

56:55.920 --> 56:58.070
Hey, blood, I will spark your girl...

56:58.160 --> 57:00.390
- Jay, don't chat...
- Don't speak for me.

57:00.480 --> 57:04.712
Listen. On Earth, where I'm from, men are
supposed to treat women with respect.

57:04.800 --> 57:08.873
If you ain't gonna chat to me with respect,
have your conversation away from me.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.598
Move!

57:14.000 --> 57:15.991
- What you looking at?
- You!

57:16.080 --> 57:18.674
- Don't look at me, man.
- Come on, man! Just jam, man.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.399
Jay, what's your problem, man?

57:59.440 --> 58:02.159
- Fuck... Get off me!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

58:02.240 --> 58:05.630
- You know what? Fuck this.
- Wait, wait. I will, I swear. Please. Fuck...

58:05.720 --> 58:08.075
Just... Sam, give me a minute.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.958
You all right, like?

58:20.800 --> 58:23.268
Yeah. I'm fine.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.194
So what you act like tings
is gonna run for then back out?

58:28.200 --> 58:30.111
It's just...

58:31.360 --> 58:34.113
It's been a while. You get me?

58:34.200 --> 58:35.792
It has!

58:35.880 --> 58:39.714
Why you let it get so far, then?
It's been time for me as well, innit?

58:44.720 --> 58:46.631
It's weird.

58:48.680 --> 58:52.719
When I was, like, 15,
all I wanted to do was get older.

58:56.080 --> 58:59.277
And now I am.
I can do anything I want.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.510
I can drink...

59:01.600 --> 59:03.909
vote...

59:04.000 --> 59:06.673
fuck... drive...

59:08.680 --> 59:10.989
I'm legally an adult.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.711
But I've realised two things.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.711
One...

59:19.920 --> 59:23.151
I would do anything
to go get them years back.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.951
Two...

59:28.720 --> 59:31.029
I never felt more alone.

59:33.800 --> 59:37.429
I've never felt more like a kid
in my whole life.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.190
D'you get me?

59:45.600 --> 59:46.555
Yeah.

59:46.640 --> 59:51.031
How you let her chat to me like that, man?
What? Are you some kind of pussy?

59:51.120 --> 59:52.712
- The only pussy is you.
- Fucking...

59:52.800 --> 59:55.678
- Relax, Jay, man.
- I'll take you on, bruv.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.110
Listen, Jay, I don't think
this is a good idea, you know.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.997
Come on, blood.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.868
Have you forgotten what my man did?
What he took from us, blood?

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.555
He killed Trife! He took everything!

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.593
- What happened to your arm?
- Nothing.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.310
- Why you fight them girls earlier?
- It was something about one of their men.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.870
It was nothing to do with me,
it was to do with Becky, but...

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.114
when you hang around with a girl
that's notorious for fucking everyone...

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.113
That's why you're here, innit?

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.317
Cos you thought,
"I'm gonna fuck the white girl."

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.516
"And she'll be easy too,
like her cousin."

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.957
He made our lives hell, blood!
For fucking years!

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.749
Then he came to that party, blood,
with a bat, and he killed our boy!

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.230
If you'd have jumped in,
it wouldn't have happened, would it?

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.151
So you have to help me!

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.791
And yeah, you know what, I had a few
when I was younger, but so what?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:03.079
Trouble is, once everyone's fucked you,
your bargaining tools is used up.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.196
You ain't got nothing left to offer.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.840
Cos if you'd done something
when you had the chance,

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.037
Trife would have still been here today!

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.714
- Come we kick, fam.
- Robert!

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.155
Yeah, come we go, blood.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.113
You know what?
I ain't got nothing.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.360
I got no man.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.274
No mates.
I got no loyalties to no one.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.476
No one's got none for me.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.235
- Lock that girl off, man!
- D'you know where he is, fam?

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.959
Yeah. I know exactly where he is.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.113
So what happened to you?

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.034
What? Why does something
have to have happened?

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:52.549
It takes something fucked-up to happen to
us for us to realise how big we fucked up.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.551
All right.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.913
Fine.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.560
You wanna know? Cool.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.235
A year and a half ago.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.794
Seven men.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.791
Three hours.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.436
They took turns.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.351
Three hours.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.837
They fucking put things in me.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.275
They raped me.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.437
And they got away with it.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.229
Cos we'd gone there,
to the gym, after hours,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.788
to meet this instructor and his mate.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.838
She didn't tell me
there was gonna be seven mates.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.913
She went off with her one,
left me with the rest.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.757
My dad had to sit in court and hear all the
shit they managed to dredge up about me.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.270
They had money.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.231
Said I was a fucking whore.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:02.512
I never sold myself, but cos I was with her,
they never believed me.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.513
We didn't speak after it happened,
lived here for ages just not talking.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.353
When she was here, that is.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.749
I had nowhere else to go.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.672
That's why I don't give a fuck
where she is, or if she ever comes back.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.916
No one deserves that.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.839
- Who you keep texting?
- No one.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.151
- Who you fucking texting?
- No one. What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.558
Sorry.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.829
What's all that on your back?

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.191
Oh, fuck...

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.637
What you want, man?

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.516
What do I want?

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.674
Do you believe in karma?

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.749
Hm?

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.958
Trife, the yout you killed...
was my nephew.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.712
Aaargh!

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.551
Shut up.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.951
Make one more fucking noise and I will
kill you even slower than I planned to.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.873
You pussy!

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.914
- Hey!
- Noooo!

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.079
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Sorry. Sorry. Fuck.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.070
- Sam, it's locked.
- Open the fucking door.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.833
- Open the fucking door!
- All right. Listen.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.675
I know. You try and block it out and
you can't, so you shut everyone else out.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.355
- Fuck you, man!
- I'll tell you what I get told all the time.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.908
What you just told me. Sam.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.709
Whatever happened to you,
whatever it was, you didn't deserve it.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.758
You did fucking deserve it,
you fucking sket!

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.434
Don't you ever
fucking say that about me!

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.278
Come we fuck him up, man.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.794
See, I knew you'd be on it, blood.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.714
We're gonna finish this tonight. Show him
he should never've fucked with us.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.157
Leave that girl as well. Come roll together
again. Jay and Moony running tings...

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.231
- My name's Robert.
- All right.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.834
Robert, then, innit?
Bob and Jay running tings.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.438
Prove to people you ain't a pussy no
more. Show Sam we're better than him.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.389
- I can't do this, blood.
- You're gonna back out of this now?

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.472
- Why you a pussy? We gotta show him...
- I am showing him!

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.712
By what? By being a pussy and letting him
get away with it? By studying your shit?

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:50.316
Yeah! I'm not doing this. I don't want
nothing to do with this. What'll it prove?

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.153
Well, fuck you then, innit.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.753
Fucking prick!

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.799
That's what it's about now, yeah? You're
gonna forget about a man over a girl.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.393
You fucking pussy.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.029
That's what you are, what you've
always been. A fucking pussyhole.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.590
What? You think you're
a big man now? What?

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.274
Maybe I'm the smart one, yeah?

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.199
He killed Trife, blood!

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.193
Hey, you, man.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.918
That's him.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.392
That's him. Come.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.199
Do this shit!

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.875
- Turn him over.
- What the fuck for, man? He hurt Henry.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.916
Give me the fucking blade.
I'll do it.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.553
Now turn the pussyhole over.
I want him to see me.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.189
- So he knows who he fucked with.
- Shit...

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.671
Sam?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.070
- What's going on?
- What you doing?

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.913
That's my brother, blood.
You man mad?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.753
Who knew
who we was looking for?

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.751
- You knew.
- What you talking about?

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.752
You knew. That's why you
didn't want to let me look at him.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.071
I didn't know nothing about this.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.071
All right, look...
Ike and Andre and them man.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.631
They had some next bre there, offering
bare Ps, blood. We'll split it, me and you.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.996
- But that's my brother.
- Fuck him! You don't even like him.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.514
You always gunning him,
telling me you hate him.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.795
Fucker's been in jail
since you was ten.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.509
- You didn't even know he came out today.
- It's still my brother, blood.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.559
So what happened to Henry?
Did my brother hurt Henry?

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.555
- What can I say, man, he weren't on it.
- You done him.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.517
You fucking pussyhole.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.750
If not for this prick,
I wouldn't have had to.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.308
- You're wrong, Dabs.
- No, you're wrong.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:29.790
Yous are all fucking wrong.
Wrong in your fucking brains!

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.919
- I'm talking about six Gs here.
- Who gave you the money, blood?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.558
Tss!

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.393
Sam, shall I bore this bre?
No one's around, man.

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:43.870
Come I just jook him and we dust, man.
Just like he was gonna do to you.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.758
- Don't be silly...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.912
Shall I do it, blood?
Just tell me, Sam.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.274
Just say the word.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.595
Nah, man.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.037
What a punch, blood!
Seriously, man...

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.519
Thung!

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.791
You all right, bruv?

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.788
Yeah, man. Come we kick.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.149
Whoa!

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.596
Oyster card too, man.
I'll go check your girl tonight, man.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.719
Safe, blood.
You dickhead, man. Fucking dickhead.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.349
- Where is he?
- He's left. He won't be far.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.078
I told you to keep him.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.879
- Have you got the gear?
- Why should I give you anything?

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.431
Come on, Jay. Please. Come on. You
took too long. I tried to keep him here.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.637
Jay, please. Please.
Just give me a little bit, all right?

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.439
- Remember when we let you stay here...
- Where's he gone?

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.354
- He doesn't want any trouble, Jay...
- Where's he gone?!

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.556
I don't know.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.431
Come on, Lex.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.430
What've I gotta do
to get information from you, huh?

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.152
- Bring my boys round?
- Fuck you.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.874
Take your fucking drugs.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.392
- What the fuck...
- It was me. What the fuck is all this shit?

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.790
- You can't tell me nothing.
- I'm not trying to tell you nothing...

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.394
You know what,
just give me your heater.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.199
I know you got one.
Just give it to me.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.310
We got to make the best
out of bad situations.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.153
I get treated certain ways
everywhere we go,

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.708
even when I'm not doing nothing,
mans watching me.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.951
Judging me.
For something you done.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.113
Right, that... that's making the best
of a bad situation.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.918
There's nothing
for man to do round here.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.514
You know what I learnt when I went
big man jail, blood? Fuck all.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.398
I packed them little breakfast trays,
did a bit of laundry.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.074
I never learnt how to not go back in.
You get on that path...

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.152
I'm not stupid like you, though, Sam!

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.915
- If I do something I'm not getting caught.
- It's not about getting caught.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.994
It's about spending your days looking over
your shoulder. I don't want that for you.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.916
- Where's this Ike bre's place?
- 40 Compromise Avenue.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.230
It's a basement flat, innit.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.799
- I'm coming.
- Stay here.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.440
- I'm coming...
- I said stay here!

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.795
I want you to stay here.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.916
Look, man.
Just do me one favour.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.590
Stay here and look after Mum. The bre
that's after me I think might come here.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.470
If you love her, if you ever loved me,
just stay here tonight.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.391
OK?

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.038
OK.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.270
You fuck with them, they'll kill you.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.954
Badder men than them have tried.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.637
I love you, Mum.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.150
Royston does too.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.633
- Take your hands out your pockets.
- What the fuck you want?

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.280
- Just do what I asked you, please, sir.
- Sam?

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.476
- It's Desmond.
- Buds?

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.551
- Buds?
- It's what they used to call me.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.996
It's all right. I know him.
Have a little walk, let me chat to him.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.798
Yeah, walk on, man.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.590
What's going on, blood?
When you come out?

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.319
Come out today, blood.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.833
Policeman?

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.639
Community support, bruv.
I can't arrest no one.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.870
I'm on 22 grand, bruv.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.789
Look, I'm... I'm sorry I never come check
you inside, man. You know what it's like.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.199
Yeah.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.429
Listen, man, I... I better dust
before my man gets annoyed, yeah?

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.229
Listen, man, how long armed-response
unit take to come round here?

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.869
There was a shooting here yesterday,
so there's a couple of cars around.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.474
- Say about 15 minutes.
- Safe, man.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.473
- Why? What's going on?
- Nothing, man. I'm just curious.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.956
You sure?

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.234
Yeah.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.356
Stay out of trouble, blood.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.429
It's OK.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.398
Desmond, or Buds,
or whatever you wanna call yourself,

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.358
I'm not gonna be made to look a fool
in front of these people.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.595
Yeah.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.238
Hello, Big?

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.390
It's Sam. I wanna ask you
for that favour.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.428
No, I ain't got it, but...
it won't take me long to get it.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.238
Filo.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.309
Yep.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.391
How you gonna get him there?

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.233
I know how to get him there.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.108
All right, man, it's... your funeral.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.589
15 minutes.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.036
I've got a proposition for you.
Call it a peace offering.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.352
But if I give this to you...
me and you, our problems are done.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.795
<i>When you get there, ask for Big Man.</i>

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.715
Give me your bag! Give me the bag, man.
I'm sorry. Just give me the bag.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.356
Hello, police? I've just been robbed
by a man with a gun.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:45.230
He's going into number 40, Compromise
Avenue. I need help right now.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.274
You're not one of our regular boys.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.635
You must be the geezer
Omen said was coming.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.836
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Big Man.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.115
I'm here to check Ike and Andre.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.111
About what?

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.518
Nice.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.556
OK.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.474
- Get the fuck over here!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.036
You got the time, blood?

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.749
You in a rush, blood?

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.354
Nah, man. I'm just asking.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.351
All right, come.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.271
Wait there, yeah?

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.149
What you saying, blood?

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.154
- So you're Big Man, yeah?
- Yeah, man.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.749
So what you want from us?

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.512
Talk then, man.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.477
Me and my business partner
heard of you.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.916
We thought it might be beneficial
for all of us if we come work with you.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.197
- So where's your partner?
- He's coming.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.912
Why do you keep looking at the clock,
blood? There somewhere you need to be?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.036
- Nah, I'm just...
- Come on, then. Tell us.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.669
Yeah. You tell us what you can do for us
that we can't do for ourselves.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.671
Didn't Omen and Dabs tell you?
You need to speak to them...

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.311
Really? And honestly,
I don't never see us working together.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.475
Think I'd have a fucking monkey like you
on my level?

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:57.356
Don't look to me for support,
you know, blood. His sister's my girl.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:06.917
And you know what? I don't really
work with man like you, you know.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.914
See what Dabs has to say about this.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.435
- Who are you?
- Where's Big Man?

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.112
Nah. It's answering machine.
Listen, I don't give a fuck...

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.748
What the fuck do you want, man?
I haven't done...

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.718
Shut your fucking mouth.
Put your hands on the table.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:44.190
Put your hands on the table.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.876
Now, you're gonna keep quiet.
And you're gonna stay in here.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.829
Or man is gonna go on different with you,
you understand me, blood?

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.793
Fuck!

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.550
What the fuck is going on?!

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.349
Back up! You stay there.
You stay on the fucking floor!

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.670
- You set me up.
- I didn't, Curtis, I swear.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.558
What the fuck is going?
All of you, shut the fuck up.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.596
- You!
- Nah, man.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.069
You. You.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.953
Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.029
And you two, you were gonna send
my own brother to come try kill me?

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.439
Are you dizzy, blood?

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.473
- All of you is fucking dead, man.
- Yeah?

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.075
Blood, can dead men do this?

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.634
Open it! Police!

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.153
Fuck!

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.312
Down! Get down!

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.157
Fuck.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.358
Hi. Sam... Um, you said
you had your mum's phone.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.268
Take him.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.271
I got problems.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.677
But I'm sorting 'em.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.949
Open this!

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.952
Listen, Jay's after you,
so just be careful.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:52.955
Um...

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.998
I know you said you missed,
like, going cinema and that,

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.719
so I've booked a couple of tickets.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.554
Thought we could just go tomorrow night,
just as mates?

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.355
Please.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.716
Call me when you get this.
If you want.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.195
Out! Police!

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.077
Police! Get down!

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.990
You think I forgot you, blood?
Is that what you think?

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.274
We don't need to do this, Jay.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.471
I'll kill you, blood.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.551
I'm gonna kill you, blood!

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.678
You think that's
faster than this, blood?

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.349
- Trife wouldn't want this. That's what he...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.908
Remember that night, blood?

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.910
- Yeah.
- And what? You think you're a big man?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.753
No, man. Look, I...
I never wanted him to die, blood.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.637
What?

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.473
You think this is just about him?

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.913
This is about me!

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.151
Why you think I'm here, huh?
Like this?

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.913
You did this.
You made this happen.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.480
I fucking hate you for it.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.120
I'm here not just for you,

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.191
I'm here because of you!

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.271
- Then I beg you, let's stop.
- That's right, blood, beg!

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.193
I wanna hear you.
I wanna hear you beg like Trife did.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.831
If that's what you want, blood.
I'm begging, man, don't do this. Please.

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.876
I'm still gonna kill you, blood.

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.078
I'm gonna take your fucking life,
like you took Trife's.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.957
Like you took mine!

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.557
Just fucking do it, man,
and get it over with.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.549
Six and a half years
and that's what you still want.

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.996
You think you're a bad man, Jay?

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.675
I thought I was a fucking bad man,
remember that?

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.799
I thought I was fucking bad,
and they put me in a big-man jail,

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.757
and look what happened to me.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.512
You see this?

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.390
This is from where I tried to kill myself
because I couldn't cope in there.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:58.278
You see these?
Look at them. Look at them!

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.514
I cut my arms so I wouldn't give them the
satisfaction of dealing out the most pain.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.673
You know why they did it to me? Because
I thought I was fucking bad, and I wasn't.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.189
Now you wanna be bad. You think
you're big, Jay. You wanna be a big man.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.829
You wanna be what I thought I was.
You wanna be me!

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.348
Then you fucking do it, blood.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.874
You see what happens to you.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.278
Is this what you want?

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.359
- See, you're just like me, man.
- No, I'm nothing like you.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.955
You ain't a killer, blood.
You're like me.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.675
You're nothing.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.480
I never meant to kill Trife, blood.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.196
And I'm so sorry.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.272
This ain't over, blood.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:38.319
You really think this is over, blood?
This ain't fucking over, blood!

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.949
Where the fuck you going, blood?
You ain't got nowhere to go.

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.793
You ain't got no friends.
You ain't got no one.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.070
This ain't over!

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.191
Yeah, it is.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.791
<i>Thought we could just go</i>
<i>tomorrow night, just as mates? Please.</i>

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.007

you get this.</i>
