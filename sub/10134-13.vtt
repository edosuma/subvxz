What kind of bug

00:03.712 --> 00:08.258
are you? DJ!

00:08.300 --> 00:10.636
Hey, Michelle.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.636
What do you have there?

00:10.678 --> 00:13.347
A hairy worm.

00:13.388 --> 00:17.225
Well, I think that hairy worm

00:13.388 --> 00:17.225
is called a caterpillar.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.187
Mr. Caterpillar

00:17.267 --> 00:20.187
is an ugly bug.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.775
Well, pretty soon he's going to

00:22.021 --> 00:24.775
turn into a beautiful butterfly.

00:24.817 --> 00:27.194
No way,<i> Jose.</i>

00:27.235 --> 00:28.403
It's true, Magoo.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.155
It's like in the fairy tales.

The princess kisses

00:30.197 --> 00:31.949
the ugly frog

00:31.991 --> 00:34.284
and he turns into

00:31.991 --> 00:34.284
a handsome prince.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.244
- Get it?

00:34.326 --> 00:36.244
- Got it, dude.

that one overboard.

Hey!

03:07.604 --> 03:09.439
Hey, you guys. How was

03:07.604 --> 03:09.439
the big double date?

03:09.481 --> 03:12.442
Oh, it was great. We ended up at

happy mountain amusement park.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.819
Yeah, it was so romantic.

We went to the

"Test your strength" booth

03:15.737 --> 03:18.281
and with one swing of the hammer

03:15.737 --> 03:18.281
Jesse rang the bell

03:18.323 --> 03:21.076
and won me this

What's the point?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.180
The clock will strike midnight.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.472
You'll kiss your girlfriend

07:11.514 --> 07:12.599
you'll kiss your fiancee

07:12.640 --> 07:14.601
and I'll go

07:12.640 --> 07:14.601
into this pathetic bit.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.065

is marry the girl of my dreams

07:51.596 --> 07:54.266

07:51.596 --> 07:54.266
see? I got a plan.

07:54.308 --> 07:59.187
What we do is secretly

07:54.308 --> 07:59.187
hide the camera like so

07:59.229 --> 08:02.023
get him up here, put him in that

08:29.926 --> 08:32.762
the best, Joey Gladstone.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.514
Right, now,

08:32.804 --> 08:34.514
Joey would never join

08:34.555 --> 08:35.974
one of these

08:34.555 --> 08:35.974
video dating services

08:36.016 --> 08:38.477
because he wouldn't

08:36.016 --> 08:38.477
want to look desperate.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.312
Not, not that you girls

08:38.518 --> 08:40.312
look desperate.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.814
I'm sure you joined up

08:40.354 --> 08:42.814
for other reasons

08:42.856 --> 08:45.192
none of them having to do

08:42.856 --> 08:45.192
anything with desperation.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.527
- Can you help me out here?

08:45.233 --> 08:47.527
- You bet I can.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.279
Who is Joey Gladstone?

08:49.321 --> 08:52.073
Well, if I was a woman,

08:49.321 --> 08:52.073
that's a big if by the way

08:52.115 --> 08:55.535
I'd say that Joey is

08:52.115 --> 08:55.535
a major hunk of beef.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.746
(Joey)

08:56.870 --> 08:58.746
'Guys, are you up there?'

08:58.788 --> 08:59.998
Alright, here he comes.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.500
Remember, he doesn't

09:00.040 --> 09:01.500
know we're taping this

09:01.541 --> 09:04.169
so you're gonna see

09:01.541 --> 09:04.169

You guys okay?

09:08.423 --> 09:10.675
Are we okay?

09:10.717 --> 09:13.345
Isn't that just

09:10.717 --> 09:13.345
like Joey Gladstone

09:13.387 --> 09:15.430
to think of other

09:13.387 --> 09:15.430
people first?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.474
So what's the big emergency?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.109
Well, Joey, I don't make

Last week, when I was

15:04.320 --> 15:06.322
rollerblading at the park--

15:06.364 --> 15:07.574
Wait a sec.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.541
Not "Rocky and friends",

15:13.954 --> 15:16.541

at the zoo.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.606
- So am I!

15:37.395 --> 15:39.606
- No, you're not!

15:39.647 --> 15:40.940
I know.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.525
We were just on

15:40.981 --> 15:42.525
such a roll there

15:42.567 --> 15:44.193
I kind of hated to see it end.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.373
(imitates Bullwinkle)

15:53.912 --> 15:57.373
That was so beautiful.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.292
I mean, that was so beautiful.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.018
Only three more minutes

16:14.974 --> 16:18.018
to go, you guys.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.730
Oh, Michelle,

16:18.060 --> 16:20.730
are you sleeping? Huh?

16:22.356 --> 16:25.401
Happy new year.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.071
No, it's still

16:26.820 --> 16:29.071
not time yet.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.407
This is taking forever.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.829
Hi, everyone.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.829
You all know Ricky.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.538
Deej, what happened

16:35.870 --> 16:37.538
with your party?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.124
Well, Kimmy's dad freaked out

16:37.580 --> 16:40.124
and sent everyone home.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
Yeah, just 'cause a few

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
extra guests showed up.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.003
How many extra guests?

16:44.044 --> 16:47.006
The police estimated 400.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.717
Four hundred? I bet

16:47.047 --> 16:49.717
the Gibblers are very happy.

16:50.885 --> 16:51.886
Yah-hey, everybody!

16:51.928 --> 16:53.429
Yah-hey!

16:53.471 --> 16:55.598
What the heck is going

16:53.471 --> 16:55.598
on out there?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.976
I estimate there's

16:55.640 --> 16:57.976
400 people outside.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.186
Good estimate. What are

16:58.017 --> 17:00.186
you guys doing here?

17:00.227 --> 17:01.771
Ah, we wanted

17:00.227 --> 17:01.771
to ring in the new year

17:01.813 --> 17:04.732
with our family, you know

17:01.813 --> 17:04.732
people we really love.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.109
Like our paperboy.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.109
Hi, Ricky.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.945
Hey, dude.

17:08.987 --> 17:12.699
I'm wearing the hat.

17:08.987 --> 17:12.699
Where's the party?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.325
It's almost time.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.077
Everybody get your confetti

17:14.367 --> 17:17.077
and noisemakers ready.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.330
And your lips.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.666
Well, I just called the phone

17:19.372 --> 17:21.666
lady and synchronized my watch.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.003
There's precisely

17:21.708 --> 17:25.003
11 seconds to go.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.796
(man on TV)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.796
'Ten, nine..'

17:26.838 --> 17:29.716
(all)

17:26.838 --> 17:29.716
...eight, seven, six..

17:29.757 --> 17:33.511
...five, four, three, two..

17:33.553 --> 17:39.058
...one. Happy new year!

17:39.099 --> 17:40.810
(man on TV)

17:39.099 --> 17:40.810
'Welcome to a brand-new year.'

17:40.852 --> 17:42.311
'Happy new year,

17:40.852 --> 17:42.311
San Francisco'

17:42.353 --> 17:44.981
'the United States,

17:42.353 --> 17:44.981
the world in general'

17:45.023 --> 17:46.440
'and the universe..'

17:48.985 --> 17:50.486
Ready for my kiss.

17:50.528 --> 17:54.281
Are you crazy? You really

17:50.528 --> 17:54.281
think I would kiss you?

17:54.323 --> 17:56.701
I just love torturing you.

17:56.743 --> 18:01.121
Well, in that case,

17:56.743 --> 18:01.121
happy new year.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.623
Whoa!

18:04.166 --> 18:06.460
Mommy!

18:06.502 --> 18:09.129
Whoa, Stephanie.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.129
Where'd you learn that?

18:09.171 --> 18:10.715
Oh.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.593
Okay, you two, why don't

18:10.757 --> 18:13.593
you just shake hands

18:13.634 --> 18:15.344
and say goodnight?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.722
Michelle, that's it.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.722
Time for bed, honey.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.891
What happened

18:17.764 --> 18:19.891
to the party?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.476
I'm sorry, honey.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.476
New year's is over.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.521
Where's the cake?

18:22.518 --> 18:25.521
Where's the presents?

18:25.563 --> 18:28.858
Sweetheart, there are no cake

18:25.563 --> 18:28.858
or presents on new year's.

18:28.900 --> 18:32.152
I stayed up all night

18:28.900 --> 18:32.152
to kiss a dog?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
This is nuts.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.116
Yeah, but tomorrow's

18:35.531 --> 18:37.116
new year's day.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.202
We get to watch

18:37.157 --> 18:40.202
37 football games.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.788
Don't wake me up.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.915
I'll see you

18:41.829 --> 18:43.915
on my birthday.

18:49.087 --> 18:53.549
You know, so far, 1991 has been

18:49.087 --> 18:53.549
the best year of my life.

18:53.591 --> 18:56.343
I know, I never want

18:53.591 --> 18:56.343
this night to end.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.805
Me neither. We got to keep

18:56.385 --> 18:58.805
the magic going.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.431
Any ideas?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.933
Yeah, I got one.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.310
- Let's get married.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.310
- Let's get married?

19:04.351 --> 19:06.479
We've known each other one

19:04.351 --> 19:06.479
night, you wanna get married?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.272
Yeah, why not?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.149
- Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.149
- Really?

19:10.190 --> 19:11.442
- Yes.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.442
- This is crazy.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.777
We'll drive to Tahoe tonight.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.904
That's even crazier.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.904
I'll go home and pack.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.197
- Crazy!

19:17.239 --> 19:19.408
- Christine.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.408
- Yes?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.035
- I really like you.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.035
- I really like you, too.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.998
- I'll be back.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.998
- You'll be back.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.793
Did you have a good

19:27.333 --> 19:28.793
new year's, honey?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.210
- It was great, sweetheart.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.210
- Not you.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.338
Great news, you guys.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.090
Christine and I are

19:32.379 --> 19:34.090
going to Tahoe tonight

19:34.132 --> 19:35.633
and we're getting married!

19:39.137 --> 19:42.306
Hello, I said I'm marrying

19:39.137 --> 19:42.306
Christine. Is this thing on?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.391
Mike test. One, two..

19:44.433 --> 19:46.019
Joey, I'm about to do

19:44.433 --> 19:46.019
this to you

19:46.060 --> 19:48.062
because I love you

19:46.060 --> 19:48.062
like a brother.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.773
Are you crazy? Get a grip!

19:48.104 --> 19:50.773
Snap out of it!

19:50.815 --> 19:52.483
Tsch! Tsch! Tsch!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.193
Hey, I know what I'm doing.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.071
Joey, no, you don't. Look I know

19:54.234 --> 19:57.071
you've been a tad lonely lately

19:57.113 --> 19:58.531
but you don't have to marry

19:57.113 --> 19:58.531
the first woman

19:58.572 --> 20:00.324
that walks by in a party hat.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.702
- Yeah, but I really like her.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.702
- Here, let me talk to him.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.245
Joey, marriage is a commitment

20:05.287 --> 20:07.915
you gotta make for the rest of

20:05.287 --> 20:07.915
your life, there's no escape.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.335
I mean you're gonna be looking

20:07.957 --> 20:11.335
at the same woman's face

20:11.377 --> 20:14.714
day after day.. Which

20:11.377 --> 20:14.714
could be a beautiful thing.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.010
I thought you and Danny

20:16.632 --> 20:19.010
set this whole thing so I'd meet

20:19.052 --> 20:20.469
the girl of my dreams.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.389
Yeah, that's true,

20:20.511 --> 20:23.389
but get to know her, Joey.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.807
Take her out in public.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.727
See what she looks

20:24.849 --> 20:27.727
like in daylight.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.020
I don't get it.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.646
Why aren't you guys

20:29.062 --> 20:30.646
happy for me?

20:30.688 --> 20:33.024
We are happy for you,

20:30.688 --> 20:33.024
we're just a little shocked

20:33.066 --> 20:38.362
and overwhelmed and distraught,

20:33.066 --> 20:38.362
but in a happy way.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.908
Joey, if you want to do it,

20:38.404 --> 20:41.908
I say go for it.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.701
Well, then I'm going.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.287
- Well, then congratulations.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.287
- Yeah.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.748
You're really,

20:47.329 --> 20:48.748
you're getting married

20:48.789 --> 20:51.584
to, uh, Christine, isn't it?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.335
I always knew you two

20:51.625 --> 20:53.335
were meant for each other.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.673
I'm getting married.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.466
- Yeah.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.427
I'm getting married.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.638
I'm getting married?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.640
What the heck do I

21:04.680 --> 21:06.640
know about this girl?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.935
[knock on door]

21:06.682 --> 21:08.935
'Joey?'

21:08.976 --> 21:10.728
Well, I know she's

21:08.976 --> 21:10.728
a fast packer.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.900
Christine, I need

21:13.397 --> 21:15.900
to talk to you.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.157
I need to talk

21:20.404 --> 21:23.157
to you, too.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.118
Let me go first.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.537
I have never been

21:25.159 --> 21:28.537
more excited to meet someone.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.539
I feel the same way.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.583
That's great.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.001
I just think we should

21:32.625 --> 21:34.001
postpone the wedding

21:34.043 --> 21:35.419
until we know each other

21:34.043 --> 21:35.419
a little better.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.256
At least till

21:35.461 --> 21:38.256
after our second date.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.800
Joey, that's exactly what

21:38.297 --> 21:40.800
I came back here to tell you.

21:40.841 --> 21:45.179
Oh, good. Boy, I really

21:40.841 --> 21:45.179
did get carried away there.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.140
I think it's because

21:45.221 --> 21:47.140
I've never had so much

21:47.181 --> 21:48.641
fun on a date before.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.436
Me, neither.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.436
So what'll we do tomorrow?

21:52.478 --> 21:54.272
- Let's rollerblade.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.272
- I was gonna say that.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.191
- Get out of here.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.568
We are going to

21:57.233 --> 21:59.568
have so much fun.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.029
I want to know

21:59.610 --> 22:02.029
everything about you

22:02.071 --> 22:04.198
starting with, uh..

22:04.240 --> 22:06.700
...what's your last name?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.619
- McCall.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.619
- McCall?

22:09.620 --> 22:12.372
♪ Aah aah aah aah ♪

22:32.977 --> 22:35.479
