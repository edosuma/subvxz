WEBVTT

00:07.160 --> 00:10.436
- We know what killed the bear.
- Who's the vet here, Sherman?

00:10.520 --> 00:12.750
You are, Denise. Who's the park ranger?

00:12.840 --> 00:15.832
- That'd be you.
- That's why I know what killed him.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.276
A scared camper drilled him
with a Winchester Magnum.338.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.557
You're afraid I'm not showing respect
to the bear's spirit.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.918
I have better things to do than wait around
for you to tell me what I already know.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.709
The law says I have to send in
as much information as I can - age, weight,

00:30.800 --> 00:33.268
what he last ate... Oh, yummy.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.158
Hot dogs, refried beans...

00:37.880 --> 00:40.440
What's that?

00:40.520 --> 00:43.159
- Beefjerky.
- Beefjerky?

00:43.240 --> 00:48.109
He was in hyperphagia, eating everything he
could find before going into hibernation. Oh.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.838
What?

00:49.920 --> 00:52.514
Sherman, this is...

00:54.800 --> 00:56.950
Oh, God.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:08.600 --> 01:10.750
- It looks human to me.
- Sorry.

01:10.840 --> 01:14.389
- What's the deaI?
- It was found in eastern Washington State.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.516
- Where?
- Inside a bear.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.637
No, I mean... Inside a bear?

01:19.720 --> 01:23.429
Autopsy revealed bone fragments
in the bear's stomach and intestine.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.795
An autopsy on an animaI is a necropsy.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.078
It's cruciaI we get that straight.
Meanwhile, about the dead human being...

01:30.160 --> 01:31.991
What do you need me for?

01:32.080 --> 01:35.470
26 bone fragments.
Case bumped to the Seattle field office.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.791
- They bumped it to me. Check it out.
- Why'd they bump it to you?

01:38.880 --> 01:43.112
Bones, I mean, do you really care
about the inner workings of the FBI office?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.316
They bumped it to you cos you work with me.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.188
No, they hoped
that you could help ID the body.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.311
- From a hand?
- Well, they have high expectations.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.520
Definitely human. Opposable thumb.
Probably male from the size.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.352
Uh-oh.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.750
- What?
- Kerf marks. Marks made from a cutting tooI.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.470
- Maybe when they cut open the bear.
- No. It's not a straight edge.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.835
ResiduaI cross-section striae.

02:10.919 --> 02:15.550
- Just cos you say it in that definitive tone...
- These marks were made from a saw.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.916
The hand was already separated
from the rest of the person.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.356
Somebody was dismembered
and fed to a bear?

02:22.440 --> 02:24.795
That's one possibility.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.873
- OK. Um, thanks, Bones.
- Glad I could help.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.520
But you're not done.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.111
I'll check out the x-rays,
see if I can confirm sex and age.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.557
- Pack. We're going to Washington State.
- I'm not going to Washington State.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.393
Again, just cos you say it
in that definitive tone

02:42.480 --> 02:45.597
doesn't mean it means anything to me.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.069
Why is Booth the one who decides?

02:48.160 --> 02:51.152
He gets the gun and the authority.
He's the one people like.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.994
Firstly, he didn't decide
that you go to Washington State.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.231
I am the one who decides
where you do and do not go.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.154
- And secondly?
- Secondly, it's time to live a little.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.310
Connect with other people.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.154
Are you suggesting I take this opportunity
to have sex with Booth?

03:08.240 --> 03:11.755
- Good God. Where's Dr Freud?
- I don't understand what you're saying.

03:11.840 --> 03:16.675
Which is precisely why I am sending you
to the Great North Woods.

03:16.760 --> 03:21.754
Come on, now. You've partially digested,
dismembered skeletaI remains to examine.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.230
That should put a smile on your face.

03:25.320 --> 03:31.111
The mosquitoes out there are the size
of dogs. Pack insect repellent.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.192
Being cooped up in a crappy hoteI
in the middle of nowhere with a $50 per diem

04:16.279 --> 04:18.396
is not my idea of a good time either.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.119
You only get $50 a day?
How can you live on that?

04:21.200 --> 04:24.909
- OK, what do you get?
- I don't have a limit. I give them the receipts.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.912
No, you have to have a limit.
We work for the government.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.877
I don't have a limit.

04:29.960 --> 04:35.114
But it's not fair. It's not fair to the taxpayers.
You're like one of those $1,000 toilet seats.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.590
I'm treated differently
because I have an indispensable skill.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.750
Indispensable I do not need you.

04:40.840 --> 04:45.277
Oh, so you can determine the origin of the
kerf marks and the sex and age of the victim?

04:45.360 --> 04:48.318
- You know, you're a smart ass.
- I'd say I'm very smart,

04:48.400 --> 04:50.550
although it has nothing to do with my ass.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.679
You know, I'll tell you what. You can
take me out to dinner, put me on your tab.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.593
That doesn't seem ethicaI.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.275
You still want that gun, now, don't you? Hm?

05:03.640 --> 05:06.029
We'll start with breakfast.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.519
<i>Y ou know, it's beautiful here.
It feels good to be out of the city.</i>

05:11.600 --> 05:15.479
<i>Y eah.
Where murderers feed their victims to bears.</i>

05:28.040 --> 05:29.029
Whew.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.715
- Small-town America. Gotta love it.
- No, this is not a small town.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.554
Chuntala in Guatemala, 150 people,
no running water, that's a small town.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.837
I said small-town America,
not small-town Guatemala.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.911
And I've been there too, by the way.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.151
- Where are you going?
- To see the sheriff.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.913
- How are you gonna do that?
- It's an old FBI trick.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.070
I'm gonna ask somebody who lives here.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.470
What took you to Guatemala? Ecotourism?

05:54.600 --> 05:59.799
I went down to shoot somebody
through the heart from 1500 feet.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.635
I was pretty sure it
was human, but I'm a vet,

06:04.720 --> 06:08.918
so I called Andrew - Dr Rigby -
and he thought it was human too.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.195
Officially I'm the coroner here,

06:11.280 --> 06:14.272
but I'm a country doctor.
I have no training in forensics.

06:14.360 --> 06:19.878
This is approximately 60% of the arm
of a male, late teens, early 20s, well-muscled.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.952
- That's amazing.
- You see these marks here?

06:23.040 --> 06:28.068
Below the radiaI tuberosity? You haven't
performed any amputations lately, have you?

06:28.160 --> 06:30.515
Uh, a few frostbit toes last winter,

06:30.600 --> 06:33.558
and a thumb
from a nasty Murphy bed accident.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.756
- Why?
- These are saw marks.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.913
That's not good,
people sawed up and eaten by bears.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.991
I'm gonna send this back to my lab.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.789
My people can give a better estimate
of when the bear ingested the arm.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.919
You got pretty good equipment there, I guess.
I'm still on diaI-up.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.549
<i>- What's the fastest way to ship a human arm?
- Charlie.</i>

06:56.920 --> 07:00.469
- Need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm trying to get rid of this one.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.676
- These are human remains.
- Oh.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.196
I have to ship them to
the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, DC.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.919
- CooI. They have Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet.
- I know.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.436
Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves.
Abraham Lincoln's top hat.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.478
- I work there.
- You ever sit in Archie Bunker's chair?

07:15.560 --> 07:19.348
I work in a different part of the museum.
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.750
- My name's Charlie.
- Yeah, I know.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.118
Wow. What, you could tell
from my, like, skull structure?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.998
It says it on your shirt, Charlie.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.789
- Where can I find the sheriff?
- He's, uh, past the garage to the right.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.555
Hey. Temperance Brennan.
I'm reading your book.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.428
Gave me a few ideas if I ever wanna
kill someone and get rid of the body.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.640
Well, don't forget, Charlie,
the heroine always catches the bad guy.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.915
Sounds good to me.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.997
<i>These are false-start kerfs,
which suggest a handsaw.</i>

07:57.080 --> 08:02.438
The cut marks from the breakaway spur here
should give me the number of teeth per inch,

08:02.520 --> 08:05.990
but to me itjust looks broken.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.073
I could work it up into
a three-dimensionaI image, see if that helps.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.833
Dr Brennan could do it from this.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.469
Not when she was a lowly grad student, Zack.

08:17.560 --> 08:22.270
Upload all the digitaI info that Brennan
sent you into my mainframe.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.555
And lighten up, Z-man.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.273
Somebody cut that guy's arm off, Sheriff.

08:29.360 --> 08:34.275
Couldn't be a locaI. Somebody missing
an arm, that's something you notice.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.397
- How many people live in Aurora?
- 326 in town.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.153
Another couple hundred in the surroundings.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.948
- Maybe 1200 on the Indian reservation.
- Tourists?

08:44.039 --> 08:47.828
Hikers. It's beautifuI country
so they don't realise it's dangerous.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.230
On average we lose a couple of
people a year. Cycle of life, eh?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.914
- Lose anyone recently?
- Woman, 29.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.390
Ann Noyes from Olympia.
Disappeared a couple of weeks ago.

08:57.480 --> 09:02.270
<i>Her parents say she was
an "experienced hiker".</i>

09:05.840 --> 09:10.755
- You must have a few resident crazies.
- Juvenile drinking, domestics, bar fights.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.957
Joyriding.
The only felons we have are poachers.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.919
They shoot the black bears and sell
the gall bladders on the black market.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.356
Park ranger handles that stuff.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.238
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Thanks. I'm with him.

09:24.320 --> 09:28.598
<i>- Suddenly I wish I was FBI.
- Sheriff Chris Scutter, Dr Brennan.</i>

09:28.680 --> 09:32.912
- My first forensic anthropologist.
- We need to find the rest of the body.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.710
Sherman - Ranger Rivers - traced the bear's
route back a week. They didn't find anything.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.792
- Is he some kind of an Indian scout?
- A Flathead Indian.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.715
- But the bear was wearing a GPS collar.
- Did he check the scat?

09:45.800 --> 09:48.633
You think there's more people parts
in the bear crap?

09:48.720 --> 09:51.314
We could go with Sherman
tomorrow, take a look.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.678
Oh, yeah. Now that you've met Bones,
you're all about interagency cooperation.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.672
"Bones"? I don't think that's
any way to talk to a lady.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.512
Thank you.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.591
Do you have dinner plans?

10:02.680 --> 10:05.877
We're working. Thanks for that.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.473
AII I am saying is, why
cut somebody into pieces?

10:10.560 --> 10:13.791
Pack 'em tighter, maybe.
Say, in a suitcase.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.790
How did a bear open a suitcase?

10:16.880 --> 10:21.590
I saw a documentary once where a
bear got in a car and drove away.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.798
That was not a documentary.
It was a cartoon.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.511
Hello.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.194
I'm looking for a Zack Addy.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.794
Got a package of human remains.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.633
I can sign for that.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.835
- Where's Jimmy?
- Tahiti, Fiji, who knows? He won the lottery.

10:43.920 --> 10:48.471
<i>Is it too much of a line to
say, "No, we won the lottery"?</i>

10:48.560 --> 10:53.953
It is. Yeah. You know, I take it back. It's
just compared to you, Jimmy, you know...

10:54.040 --> 10:57.828
- The third nostriI.
- That whistling sound when he sneezes.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.549
<i>Unfortunately, it is too soon
to ask you to have coffee.</i>

11:01.640 --> 11:05.519
- It is? - Yes. Yes, coffee
is the third-delivery capper.

11:05.600 --> 11:11.357
- So what's the first-delivery capper? -
InitiaI contact, meet-cute, light flirting.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.117
Then I'll catch you in
another couple of deliveries.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.589
OK.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.750
Bye.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.156
- You bogarted my package.
- You panicked and froze, my man,

11:26.240 --> 11:28.470
thus the package came into play.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.552
Also, incorrect use
of the verb "bogarted".

11:32.560 --> 11:37.111
We've been looking for that female hiker,
but sometimes you never find a trace.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.990
They fall into a ravine, the river...
So, how do you like the Evergreen Lodge?

11:42.080 --> 11:46.312
Very nice. I have a beautifuI view
of the mountains from my terrace.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.152
- You have a terrace?
- Yeah.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.231
I'm sharing a bathroom.

11:50.320 --> 11:54.632
- This is where the bear was shot.
- How far did he get before he died?

11:54.720 --> 11:58.190
- About 100 yards.
- How do you know that's the right way?

11:58.280 --> 12:02.193
- Not hard to track a wounded bear.
- Ever hear of the bone gatherers?

12:02.280 --> 12:06.034
Collecting bones so the dead can
make theirjourney to the next world?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.509
I'm not even sure I
believe in the next world.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.876
Doesn't matter what you believe
in. You're a bone gatherer.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.872
That's a good thing,
helping the spirits move on.

12:14.960 --> 12:19.033
Thank you. That's probably the
bestjob description I'll ever get.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.031
<i>Over here.</i>

12:21.120 --> 12:24.237
- You find something?
- Does a bear scat in the woods?

12:24.320 --> 12:27.869
I think he voided here and
he headed off over there.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.029
OK.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.192
See if you can find any older samples.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.477
- She ain't the squeamish type, is she?
- I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Sherman,

12:40.560 --> 12:46.749
and guess you don't get a lot of eligible,
good-looking women coming through town.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.117
- Hey. I just finished chapter seven.
- This has to go to my...

12:54.200 --> 12:56.714
Do you do all the stuff
the girI in your book does?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.360
I'm uncomfortable
discussing that with you.

12:59.440 --> 13:03.672
I'm not talking about the sex. I'm
talking about the running and the shooting.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.435
I mean, if you do do all that
other stuff that's great too,

13:07.520 --> 13:11.911
for you and, um, whoever
you're doing it with.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.356
- I'd like to send this to my lab.
- Uh, more bones?

13:15.440 --> 13:19.035
- No, it's bear scat.
- Oh. I can deaI with that.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.112
<i>Brennan.</i>

13:22.200 --> 13:24.873
The person who belonged
to the arm died a week ago,

13:24.960 --> 13:27.793
and the bear ate it one
to three days after that.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.839
<i>- Anything from the saw?
- Angela's entering the data.</i>

13:31.920 --> 13:35.674
I found something else I can't
categorise. Can I beam it to you?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.751
OK. Hold on.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.198
- Do you mind if I set this up here?
- Yeah. No problem.

13:45.160 --> 13:49.199
<i>- I'm connecting with the satellite.
- All right.</i>

13:51.400 --> 13:53.550
OK. I'm linked.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.279
<i>- I've been focusing on...
- So, who's that?</i>

13:56.360 --> 13:59.079
- My assistant, Zack.
- Hey, Zack.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.628
<i>- Who's that?
- The overnight guy. Charlie.</i>

14:01.720 --> 14:03.790
You can send me the picture.

14:05.560 --> 14:09.075
<i>- Zack, does your boss have a boyfriend?
- Not currently.</i>

14:09.160 --> 14:11.720
<i>- Are you extremely
good-looking? - Yes, I am.</i>

14:11.800 --> 14:15.076
- Zack, these are bite marks.
- You mean from the bear?

14:15.160 --> 14:17.674
Black bears' premolars
are small and piglike.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.196
- These marks show a double cusp
pattern. - Pigs are double-cusped.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.670
- Hey, Zack, are you extremely smart?
- Yes, I am, Charlie.

14:24.760 --> 14:28.799
Pigs have six incisors. These marks
were made by four incisors, like a chimp,

14:28.880 --> 14:32.555
except these teeth
form a continuous arch.

14:32.640 --> 14:37.668
<i>- So, what's got a continuous arch?
- Humans.</i>

14:37.760 --> 14:40.752
We don'tjust have a killer on our hands.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.035
We have a cannibaI.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.549
Zack'll have the odontologist
take a look, but I'm right.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.316
- A cannibaI. You mean a HannibaI Lecter?
- I don't know what that means.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.914
You're certain a human
gnawed on that bone?

15:01.000 --> 15:05.152
- Bit, gnawed, removed the flesh.
- That's... that's really not good.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.789
Are you sure, Bones? You've never
seen anything like this before?

15:08.880 --> 15:14.000
Of course I have. I did grad work among the
Wari'. They have a history of cannibalism.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.358
I've seen evidence of cannibalism in
some 12th-century Native American sites.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.238
- It's not a big deaI.
- Have you ever...?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.788
I've never been offered
human flesh before.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.952
- Maybe if you had...?
- It's an interesting question.

15:27.040 --> 15:32.114
I'd have to measure my sociaI inculcation
against objective scientific inquiry.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.749
- OK, that's sick.
- Maybe someone who needs to be rescued.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.960
Maybe the young man died and the missing
girI, hungry and lost, came upon him.

15:41.040 --> 15:45.158
- Needing food, she...
- Sawed him up and barbecued him?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.435
There's no evidence the hand was cooked.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.751
She does not look like a girI
who would chew on raw flesh.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.718
When survivaI instincts kick in...

15:53.800 --> 15:56.633
If it isn't her, we're dealing
with some psycho killer.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.597
This is sick.

16:00.120 --> 16:04.989
Someone eating raw human
flesh is going to get sick.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.350
- Teeth marks?
- Yes.

16:11.440 --> 16:15.035
These drag marks are where the
flesh was ripped right off the bone.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.749
- Ugh. It's like a zombie movie.
- Where is my bear poop?

16:18.840 --> 16:22.435
Is it the excrement you're
anxious to look at or the courier?

16:22.520 --> 16:27.469
- What do you think?
- Somebody gnawed on this arm like corn?

16:27.560 --> 16:32.395
According to that team that crashed in the
Andes, human flesh tastes like frogs' legs.

16:32.480 --> 16:36.996
- As though I need a reason never to eat frogs.
- I'm gonna make a cast of these markings.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.470
We won't get a full dentaI
impression, but we'll get something.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.754
Zack.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.070
You're needed upstairs.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.517
Angela.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.831
If we were a soccer team
and crashed in the Andes,

16:53.920 --> 16:56.639
who would you rather eat? Me or Zack?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.314
What?

17:07.280 --> 17:11.512
- I have a package for a Zack Addy.
- That's me.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.989
I thought... There was the other guy.

17:14.079 --> 17:19.518
That was Hodgins. He zoomed
you because you're so beautifuI.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.036
- Thanks. That's sweet.
- I-I'm not being sweet.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.190
It's just a fact.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.196
- How old are you?
- 24.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.271
24.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.555
I could just eat you up.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.914
Have you diagnosed anyone
with a prion disease?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.514
Prion disease? No.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.718
Some Alzheimer's, yes. Some brain
damage due to alcoholism and huffing.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.758
Delusions? Erratic
behaviour? Violent outbursts?

17:56.840 --> 17:59.752
The incubation period for a
prion disease can be years.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.037
You're thinking the cannibaI
might be showing symptoms?

18:03.120 --> 18:06.112
Dr Rigby, I never said
anything about a cannibaI.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.668
Well, it's all over town.

18:08.760 --> 18:13.470
Charlie. The overnight guy. What do you
think our chances are of keeping this quiet?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.755
I'd say absolutely zero.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.391
- I was waiting to see her.
- You were waiting for bear poop.

18:28.480 --> 18:32.234
I said, "Are you excited about it?"
and you said, "What do you think?"

18:32.320 --> 18:37.474
- You thought I was excited about excrement?
- You have to be clear.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.755
What's that?

18:41.600 --> 18:44.751
- It's a piece of undigested bone.
- MetacarpaI.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.308
I think that goes with my hand.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.789
<i>Part of a tin can.</i>

18:50.760 --> 18:52.876
Elastin fibres.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.871
Some kind of sporocarp.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.871
Here's something.

19:07.480 --> 19:12.076
Hair follicles. Sebaceous
glands. It's a layer of dermis.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.756
- Pigmentation marks in the microphage.
- A flap of skin with a tattoo.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.035
We need a tattoo expert.

19:22.720 --> 19:27.111
It's fairly simple. Uh,
two colours, red and black.

19:28.840 --> 19:33.038
- Some kind of native design.
- She likes me more than she likes you.

19:33.120 --> 19:37.113
- She said I was sweet.
- I made her laugh at Jimmy's third nostriI.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.829
That's pretty good, making a
woman laugh at a third nostriI.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.390
- We have a tentative coffee date.
- She said she wanted to eat me up.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.677
Zack's definitely ahead on points.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.670
There it is.

19:57.040 --> 20:01.033
<i>- The skin in the scat has a sun on it.
- What is that? A haiku?</i>

20:01.120 --> 20:03.270
It's a tattoo.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.319
Hi, Booth. Hi. I'm Angela Montenegro.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.392
<i>- How you doing, Angela?
- Angela, focus, please.</i>

20:10.480 --> 20:12.471
It's a Haida sun motif.

20:12.560 --> 20:17.588
Good work. Very impressive. 18 to
25-year-old man, Haida sun tattoo on his arm?

20:17.680 --> 20:21.468
<i>Hey, Booth, I have kind of a
thing for tattoos. Y ou got any?</i>

20:21.560 --> 20:23.869
<i>Angela.</i>

20:23.960 --> 20:29.318
I'm sorry, sweetie, but what's with that town?
You getting any from that hot overnight guy?

20:29.400 --> 20:33.029
<i>- Ange, we're trying to work.
- Is that town totally wasted on you?</i>

20:33.120 --> 20:36.795
Because I take this as a
sign from God to loosen up.

20:36.880 --> 20:41.795
You know what they say. What
happens in Aurora stays in Aurora.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.595
Hey.

20:43.680 --> 20:48.595
I'm running a missing persons check
using the new info on the tattoo.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.990
- She seems friendly, your associate.
- She's 3,000 miles away.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.958
I'd send away for a Russian bride.

20:55.040 --> 21:00.034
Adam Langer, 22. Missing ten
days from college in Richland.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.875
Wait, I know this kid. He used to come up
to visit Sherman. Wanted to be a ranger.

21:06.680 --> 21:11.470
Look, I've known Sherman for years. I can't
believe he had anything to do with this.

21:15.840 --> 21:19.913
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Hey, Sherman. Mind if we come in?

21:20.000 --> 21:23.231
- You here about the cannibaI?
- We can't talk about business.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.788
- How's about some tea?
- Sure.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.675
Oh, yeah.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.716
What'd you do that for?

21:33.800 --> 21:37.236
Give you a chance to look
around, get a sense of the man.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.269
The raven spirit. In
Native American stories

21:40.360 --> 21:44.239
<i>it has a cannibalistic element.</i>

21:44.320 --> 21:47.039
He went out back. Give
me your flashlight.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.352
<i>- No way you'll catch Sherman in the woods.
- Just search the place.</i>

21:51.440 --> 21:54.034
Sherman, stop.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.797
I don't know if a wall of knives
is evidence, but it is creepy.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.755
Hey. Hey, stop!

22:10.880 --> 22:13.075
<i>Is there a saw?</i>

22:14.440 --> 22:15.668
Yup.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.275
We wanna take it, see if it matches
the cuts in Adam Langer's bones.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.669
And see if this matches the teeth marks.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.956
You gotta be kidding me.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.911
As justice of the peace I
authorise you to open that freezer.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.991
Thank you.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.072
What kind of meat do you think that is?

22:50.480 --> 22:54.393
I sent a bunch of frozen meat by
overnight air. I need to know what it is.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.037
<i>- You think it's human?
- Maybe. It's a funny colour.</i>

22:58.120 --> 23:00.588
- Did you catch the guy?
- No. Booth lost him.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.194
- Whoa. I didn't lose him.
- You didn't catch him.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.316
<i>- So you two have the night free.
- Y es.</i>

23:05.400 --> 23:09.837
We can't do anything. Booth has to wait
till it's light to look for the guy he lost.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.990
I didn't lose him, OK? I... He...

23:12.080 --> 23:14.435
Tell her that my flashlight died.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.112
- She doesn't care.
- What?

23:16.200 --> 23:18.668
- Give me that.
- It's not safe to drive and talk.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.718
- Are you two fighting?
- ProfessionaI pride. Tell her.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.873
Booth wants you to know that he lost
the guy because his flashlight died.

23:25.960 --> 23:30.670
And because he's an Indian and a park ranger
and he's very familiar with the territory.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.320
- Did you hear that?
- Something about Indians?

23:33.400 --> 23:36.790
She says she understands. I need
to know about that meat ASAP.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.030
<i>- I'll tell Zack.
- Give me the phone.</i>

23:39.120 --> 23:41.350
- What?
- It wasn't even my flashlight.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.228
It was the sheriff's flashlight
and his batteries, they ran out. OK?

23:45.320 --> 23:48.790
- Good night, Angela.
- Hey. You have to take that man for a drink.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.155
And have a little fun yourself.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.879
Fun and a drink. Where do we find that?

23:59.160 --> 24:04.075
So, I was surprised to see you here. In your
book you never sleep till you get your man.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.312
That's not me. That's a character. In
reaI life you have to wait for lab results.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.675
- I see. Well, lucky for me.
- I don't know.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.149
I'm not a very good
dancer. Apparently I lead.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.631
- So I'll follow.
- Hey, Booth. Want a beer? Another beer.

24:17.720 --> 24:22.077
I climbed with Adam sometimes. I was
freaked out when I found out it was his arm.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.391
- You knew Adam Langer?
- I taught him how to climb.

24:25.480 --> 24:29.598
Man, he was strong. No matter how
much I lift, I could never match him.

24:29.680 --> 24:34.356
You have excellent definition
in your biceps and triceps.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.353
Well, thanks. And your
waist muscles feeI good too.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.079
Transverse abdominals. Thank you.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.559
So, that meat we sent back to your
lab, that wasn't more of Adam, was it?

24:45.640 --> 24:48.916
<i>- I can't discuss...
- Excusez-moi.</i>

24:49.000 --> 24:50.149
Dr Rigby.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.357
I can't imagine you and Charlie
have a lot to talk about.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.271
We were managing.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.079
<i>I guess it looks pretty bad for Sherman.</i>

24:58.160 --> 25:00.720
I can't discuss the
investigation with you.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.360
Look, Sherman is a Flathead.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.910
The spirituaI beliefs of his
tribe don't value cannibalism.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.151
Anthropology teaches us that
beliefs and customs evolve.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.312
That's why you still find
cannibalism practised today.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.278
You can justify the act of
eating another human being?

25:16.360 --> 25:18.351
I can understand it intellectually.

25:18.440 --> 25:23.389
I shouldn't be talking shop, not with
such a beautifuI woman in my arms.

25:23.480 --> 25:29.635
Sheriff time. You think you can match the
bite marks on the apple with those on that arm?

25:29.720 --> 25:32.598
I'm not comfortable discussing
it on the dance floor.

25:32.680 --> 25:36.878
- I'm the sheriff. We're colleagues.
- Mind if I cut in?

25:36.960 --> 25:40.350
- Thought you might need a break.
- What happened to your shirt?

25:40.440 --> 25:44.115
- Well, we're in a bar. It's a look.
- Everybody's pumping me.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.760
- Sorry?
- For information on the case.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.832
- They're only pretending to be interested.
- Why?

25:49.920 --> 25:52.115
- They're hitting on you.
- Are you sure?

25:52.200 --> 25:56.113
Yes, I'm sure. You're the hottest
thing this town has seen in a long time.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.270
Check out the competition.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.995
Now, that is someone who
wants to eat your heart.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.430
<i>Ooh, very pretty.</i>

26:08.520 --> 26:14.311
<i>Lovely. It's a sporocarp called Tuber
gibbosum after a week in bear poop.</i>

26:14.400 --> 26:19.235
- Thank you for ruining my moment.
- It's a mushroom. An Oregon white truffle.

26:19.320 --> 26:23.472
A mycorrhizaI species that only grows
in symbiosis with Douglas fir trees.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.314
- Are Douglas fir trees very rare in the woods?
- No.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.631
- Then you haven't found anything usefuI.
- No.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.792
- You wanna get something to eat?
- No.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.952
- Oh, you're expecting a delivery tonight.
- Zack is.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.874
- And you're going to zoom him.
- Like the Indy 500, baby.

26:45.040 --> 26:49.909
<i>- You didn't come down for breakfast.
- I wasn't hungry. Sorry you had to pay.</i>

26:50.000 --> 26:54.516
- I called your room. There was no answer.
- Why the sudden interest in my habits?

26:54.600 --> 26:58.149
I just thought we were gonna get
something to eat, so I waited.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.516
My eggs got cold, that's all. Cold eggs.

27:03.120 --> 27:07.159
<i>- This is where my flashlight failed.
- My flashlight. And how can you be sure?</i>

27:07.240 --> 27:11.028
<i>- Cos this is where I was standing.
- A shirt button?</i>

27:11.120 --> 27:14.749
And I heard him, uh,
disappear in this direction.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.753
Leaving buttons on the traiI.
Must be an old fish-chewer trick.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.628
You mean a snake eater.
An old snake-eater trick.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.469
- Were you here all night?
- Yes. Did I miss Toni?

27:29.560 --> 27:30.788
Yes.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.077
- She asked about you.
- And you torpedoed me, didn't you?

27:34.160 --> 27:37.914
No, I told her the truth. That
you were sifting through excrement.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.039
You want a war? Fine,
because I am the warrior.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.556
Zack, I got the measurements
for your saw from the Angelator.

27:45.640 --> 27:50.270
Now all you have to do is find a
match. Say thank you with gifts.

27:50.360 --> 27:54.239
- Did you work all night?
- Yes. I shaved the truffle.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.869
- Is that anything like spanking the monkey?
- I found boring dust.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.475
<i>- Is there any other kind?
- It's produced by beetles.</i>

28:01.560 --> 28:03.755
The tree the truffle
grew on was infested.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.513
- That won't impress Toni.
- That's not why I did it.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.558
I did it to serve justice
and capture a cannibaI.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.359
That'll impress the hot courier.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.510
I am back in the game.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.150
No way you'll catch Sherman in the
woods. He's a park ranger and an Indian.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.959
Right there.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.600
Oh. He's doing some
kind of Indian rituaI.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.830
<i>Waiting for us.</i>

28:31.920 --> 28:34.832
<i>The meat samples you sent
us were all Ursus americanus.</i>

28:34.920 --> 28:37.480
Black bear.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.233
- I didn't kill no one.
- Why'd you run?

28:40.320 --> 28:44.518
You're FBI. Ever hear of
Leonard Peltier? Pine Ridge?

28:44.600 --> 28:49.151
- Wounded Knee? Indians and FBI don't mix.
- He ran because he's the poacher.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.312
- You're the poacher?
- The meat we found was black bear.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.356
No wonder you never caught him.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.638
<i>You should look out for a patch of wood
infested with Dendroctonus brevicomis.</i>

28:58.720 --> 29:03.874
Hodgins says that the bear dug up the arm in
a stand of pine-beetle-infested Douglas fir.

29:03.960 --> 29:09.478
Say you did catch a poacher, an Indian who
shouldn't have to follow white man's law.

29:09.560 --> 29:14.315
- Not even a park ranger?
- He could show you a stand of trees like that.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.359
- Would you maybe let that Indian go?
- The saw is 300mm

29:18.440 --> 29:22.513
with 32 offset teeth per inch with a
wobble factor of 1/100th of an inch.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.989
That's a common hacksaw.
That won't help us.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.390
I'm just wondering if you'll
be sending us any more samples.

29:28.480 --> 29:33.270
Yeah, uh, even more of the same samples,
in case we wanna double-check the data.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.078
<i>I'II let you know.</i>

29:35.160 --> 29:38.550
- Do you think she'll send more?
- God in heaven, I hope so.

29:38.640 --> 29:43.589
Japanese pay a fortune for bear meat. Think
the gall bladders fix up their pecker troubles.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.752
Would've gotten away with it
if you hadn't kept the meat.

29:46.840 --> 29:51.595
- I'm not admitting nothing.
- He couldn't bring himself to waste the meat.

29:51.680 --> 29:55.958
This patch of trees is
all infested with beetles.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.952
According to the GPS, the
bear was here seven days ago.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.157
<i>- Fits the time line.
- What are we looking for?</i>

30:02.240 --> 30:06.153
I'm guessing a shallow grave that's
been disrupted by a hungry bear.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.313
Or maybe some kind of
satanic Stonehenge circle.

30:17.520 --> 30:22.548
<i>We see this all the time. Kids get baked, do
their own version of The Blair Witch Project.</i>

30:22.640 --> 30:26.599
- I don't know what that means.
- It's a horror movie, Bones.

30:26.680 --> 30:30.992
- Didn't make any sense.
- Scary, though, with the bloody hand prints.

30:31.080 --> 30:35.278
I'm gonna beam you some stills of what
looks like a ritualistic Indian site.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.397
- A medicine wheeI of some kind.
- This thing legit?

30:38.480 --> 30:40.152
What am I, a shaman?

30:40.240 --> 30:44.711
Goodman is an expert in Native American
anthropology. He'll tell you what it means.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.712
Sherman, you're looking
guiltier by the minute.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.314
Oh, shut up, Chris. You
know better than that.

30:50.400 --> 30:55.599
<i>Hey, you're a poacher, man. I sure
as hell didn't see that coming either.</i>

30:59.040 --> 31:01.031
Got something?

31:01.120 --> 31:05.113
Waxy leaves means methane
gas is leeching from the soiI.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.634
Like a body?

31:13.960 --> 31:18.317
<i>- That's Adam Langer.
- Oh, there's a woman here, too.</i>

31:18.400 --> 31:20.550
Probably Ann Noyes, the hiker.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.433
And she's missing her heart.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.192
<i>It's a perversion of a
Salish medicine wheeI.</i>

31:38.280 --> 31:43.593
This is the Spirit Chief Chichaumichu. The
southern stone should represent strength.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.592
The centre of the wheeI
should represent life force.

31:46.680 --> 31:50.275
- This is upside down and inside out.
- We're dealing with a cannibaI.

31:50.360 --> 31:55.195
You could interpret this as a way of taking
energy from someone by eating their flesh.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.033
Zoom in.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.795
Yeah.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.316
This is the symboI
for strength, the arm.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.915
This one is for spirit, the heart.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.232
This one for knowledge...
and this is for courage.

32:11.320 --> 32:15.677
So we're looking for maybe a
scarecrow, tin man or a lion?

32:15.760 --> 32:18.672
You say two bodies were found?

32:20.760 --> 32:23.228
<i>Over here. They were dug up by a bear.</i>

32:23.320 --> 32:29.316
One showing signs that his arm was eaten by
the cannibaI, the other missing her heart.

32:30.200 --> 32:34.239
There should be two more
bodies to complete the rituaI.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.676
They checked the site.
There were only these two.

32:37.760 --> 32:41.753
If I've analysed this correctly, it
means there will be two more victims.

32:42.280 --> 32:46.034
- Both killed by gunshots to the head.
- These stellate patterns at the entry wounds

32:46.120 --> 32:49.908
indicate a low-calibre
handgun at close range.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.514
- That's remarkable.
- Not really.

32:52.600 --> 32:57.276
Based on adipocere formation, I'm estimating
the female has been dead for about...

32:57.360 --> 32:59.112
A week?

32:59.200 --> 33:01.395
- Very good.
- Thanks.

33:02.760 --> 33:06.673
Well, her clothing matches that of
Ann Noyes, and the male is Adam Langer.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.751
My people at the Jeffersonian tell me

33:08.840 --> 33:12.435
the medicine wheeI suggests a
perversion of an old healing rituaI.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.830
He may have eaten the arm for
strength and the heart for spirit.

33:15.920 --> 33:20.710
Well, that makes sense from a certain
point of view. Do they think it's an Indian?

33:20.800 --> 33:23.633
- No way to tell.
- Look, I'm no policeman,

33:23.720 --> 33:27.679
but it doesn't make sense that Sherman
would lead you straight to the evidence

33:27.760 --> 33:31.150
that proves he's a
murderer and a cannibaI.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.276
Adam was a good guy.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.669
He wanted to be a park ranger.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.991
- I was a... What do you call it?
- His mentor?

33:39.080 --> 33:41.230
That's right. His mentor.

33:41.320 --> 33:46.189
Taking him out with me on my rounds,
showing him the ropes of the job.

33:46.280 --> 33:51.229
Well, maybe Adam found out you were
poaching so you made sure he wouldn't talk.

33:51.320 --> 33:55.711
So I ate his arm and someone's heart for
dessert because that's the type of guy I am.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.951
You know he fits the description
of someone missing an arm.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.838
Why don't you say anything?

34:01.920 --> 34:04.878
Somebody says maybe they're
gonna come and visit.

34:04.960 --> 34:10.034
Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Maybe
they go see their climbing buddy instead.

34:10.120 --> 34:13.112
<i>- Charlie?
- The overnight guy?</i>

34:13.199 --> 34:17.876
- Maybe sometimes they go visit a girI.
- What girI?

34:17.960 --> 34:20.632
I'm not comfortable saying.

34:20.719 --> 34:26.078
Well, maybe, what with the murders and
cannibalism, you get past that discomfort.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.873
Adam had a thing with the vet
lady. So did his buddy Charlie.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.190
You know how jealous
white people can be.

34:34.280 --> 34:39.797
Um, in the interest of full disclosure, I
gotta say I see Denise from time to time, too.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.235
What? You find that funny?

34:42.320 --> 34:45.551
- The apple we found in Sherman's cabin?
- You get a mould?

34:45.639 --> 34:50.077
<i>The mould from the apple does not
match the teeth marks on the bone.</i>

34:50.159 --> 34:53.152
- What does that mean?
- It means you aren't the cannibaI.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.913
- I already knew that.
- The point was to convince us.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.753
Do we start checking
everybody's teeth in town?

34:58.840 --> 34:59.989
Not everybody.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.390
We consume, we are consumed.

35:03.480 --> 35:08.634
We are consumed by greed,
by ambition, lust, jealousy.

35:08.720 --> 35:12.793
- Dr Randall, if you'd like...
- Even regular love is a form of cannibalism.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.916
Could you put the dentaI medium...?

35:15.000 --> 35:18.879
The whole perfect idea of love
is that two people become one.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.590
- Now, that's a kind of consumption.
- We're talking something a little more literaI.

35:23.680 --> 35:27.832
- We need her to bite it.
- Why didn't you report him missing?

35:27.920 --> 35:30.992
Because I would've had to
admit that he and I were lovers.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.277
- Why not admit it?
- It would've made another guy angry.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.715
What other guy?

35:36.800 --> 35:38.279
Charlie.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.032
And Sheriff Scutter.

35:40.120 --> 35:44.033
And Andrew Rigby, and maybe
a couple of others. I don't...

35:45.560 --> 35:50.588
Well, there's not a lot to do in a place
like Aurora, so what you do, you do lots.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.955
- Can you bite this?
- If I were your cannibaI,

35:53.040 --> 35:57.477
would I have pointed out that there were
human bones in the bear after the autopsy?

35:57.560 --> 36:01.030
An autopsy on an animaI
is called a necropsy.

36:01.720 --> 36:06.396
Yeah. There's a reason I get
all the guys and you don't.

36:06.480 --> 36:12.396
And let me tell you, if I ate Adam,
there wouldn't be anything left.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.673
<i>Here and here. These look
like tooth marks again.</i>

36:18.760 --> 36:20.637
- OK.
- But they're too regular.

36:20.720 --> 36:26.352
They're exactly 2.4mm apart. Teeth aren't
that exact. It has to be some kind of machine.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.796
- She was eaten by a machine?
- I don't know.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.316
We got a love triangle.
Quadrangle, octangle, whatever.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.756
- Jealousy, always a good motive.
- For murdering Adam Langer.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.879
But Ann Noyes? And the cannibalism?
We're looking for someone who's insane.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.350
The rant the vet had about people
consuming each other was wacky.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.671
Yeah, but kind of true,
don't you think? Hey, Angela.

36:48.760 --> 36:53.436
<i>- Zack wants to beam you something.
- OK. Hold on a second.</i>

36:55.000 --> 36:58.913
See if you can tell what it is. But if
you're in a public place, cover your screen.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.310
<i>- What am I looking at?
- Indentations on Noyes'sternum.</i>

37:02.400 --> 37:04.356
<i>- Magnification?
- 40.</i>

37:04.440 --> 37:07.830
I can't believe both Dr Rigby
and I missed these. Good job.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.718
- What are they?
- How far apart are they?

37:10.800 --> 37:12.597
2.4mm.

37:12.680 --> 37:18.710
OK. These marks and the splitting of the
bone here were made by a sternum spreader.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.268
There's no record of
Ann having heart surgery.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.793
Rigby didn't miss it.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.873
<i>Moments like this are why I need a gun.</i>

37:26.960 --> 37:29.952
Where else do you keep them? Thank you.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.510
That is for self-defence, so
don'tjust go blasting away in there.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.910
What if I have to shoot? What
part of his body should I hit?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.709
The part that isn't me. Just stay back.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.234
- The bodies are gone.
- What's he gonna do?

37:45.320 --> 37:50.758
- Take 'em into the woods for a snack?
- If I were him, I'd destroy the evidence.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.273
Step away from the
incinerator, Dr Rigby.

38:02.440 --> 38:06.069
You don't understand. It's a spirituaI
right to share the life force.

38:06.160 --> 38:11.359
You're nuts. We get it. We don't need the
rambling psycho speech on why you did it.

38:11.440 --> 38:15.069
You know that ancient
civilisations would sacrifice some

38:15.160 --> 38:18.596
<i>in order to preserve the strength and...</i>

38:20.840 --> 38:24.469
- What'd you do that for?
- Nobody wants that rambling psycho speech.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.915
A bedpan?

38:27.360 --> 38:28.429
Hm.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.758
- Why do we have to face her together?
- Want this settled?

38:33.840 --> 38:36.718
I'd definitely like this settled.

38:38.360 --> 38:44.310
<i>- What are you doing here?
- It's like watching Clash of the Horny Titans.</i>

38:47.080 --> 38:52.393
- Who'd like to sign for this?
- Who wouldn't want to sign for it?

38:54.200 --> 38:57.397
So the idea is whoever signs for this...

38:57.480 --> 39:02.349
- Yes. The act of signing is an analogue for...
- She gets it.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.795
Oh.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.831
Oh.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.918
Oh.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.196
That is really sweet.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.271
Thank you.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.430
That is so hot.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.034
Why? Why is that hot?

39:37.120 --> 39:42.672
- It'd be hotter if she'd chosen me.
- No, this is definitely hotter.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.790
And to think I didn't wanna come
here. This was a fascinating case.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.917
You don't often find
cannibalism so close to home.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.228
Which I find a plus.

39:56.320 --> 40:00.916
There are always individuals within a species
who are driven to break the basic taboos.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.949
- I mean, Rigby actually ate human flesh.
- Bones, I just got my steak and eggs.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.555
Rigby has a prion disease. He's
been a cannibaI for some time.

40:09.640 --> 40:13.428
<i>- He could use the insanity defence.
- The guy is nuts.</i>

40:13.520 --> 40:18.719
Is he nuts cos he got a brain disease from
eating human flesh, or was he already nuts?

40:18.800 --> 40:22.634
Or did he just lick his
fingers after surgery?

40:22.720 --> 40:28.113
- I should just become a vegetarian.
- Or as an alternative, just don't eat people.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.030
You know, I'm gonna come
back up here this winter.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.236
Charlie says the skiing's great.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.595
Oh, Charlie.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.875
Yeah. The overnight guy.
