01:23.801 --> 01:25.133
You know, Bobby,

01:25.167 --> 01:26.634
I been thinking
about something.

01:26.667 --> 01:27.634
Yeah?

01:27.667 --> 01:29.667
Look at me--
I get up every morning,

01:29.701 --> 01:30.367
I eat breakfast,

01:30.400 --> 01:32.200
I get dressed, I go to the gym

01:32.234 --> 01:33.400
and I come to work.

01:33.434 --> 01:35.934
I go home, I watch TV,
and I go to sleep.

01:35.968 --> 01:37.100
Next day, I wake up,

01:37.133 --> 01:39.434
I start the whole thing
all over again.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.534
Yeah, I think about my life
that way sometimes too, Tony.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.334
It's depressing,
isn't it?

01:44.367 --> 01:45.501
Depressing?!

01:45.534 --> 01:47.701
I was thinking I had it made.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.434
Hey, good evening,
everybody.

01:51.467 --> 01:52.434
Hey, Alex.
Yo, Alex.

01:52.467 --> 01:53.601
Hey, Louie got our
cabs ready yet?

01:53.634 --> 01:54.601
No.
Not yet.

01:54.634 --> 01:55.767
( <i>groans</i> )

01:55.801 --> 01:57.767
Hey, Rieger,
how's your daughter?

01:57.801 --> 01:58.767
My daughter?

01:58.801 --> 02:00.100
I don't know,
I guess she's fine.

02:00.133 --> 02:02.968
Haven't heard from her
for awhile.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.133
Hey, wait a minute.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.634
How come you're asking me
a normal human question?

02:07.667 --> 02:08.800
I don't know.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.701
I just thought I'd try it.

02:10.734 --> 02:11.934
Oh.

02:11.968 --> 02:13.300
You can ask me a normal
human question

02:13.334 --> 02:14.767
once in a while too, you know.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.434
It's a two-way street.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.767
All right.

02:17.801 --> 02:20.868
You still have
that cockroach problem, Louie?

02:23.100 --> 02:24.501
Yeah.
ALEX:
Hm.

02:24.534 --> 02:26.267
Thanks for asking.

02:27.934 --> 02:29.968
There!
Would you believe that?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.701
There's one
of the little buggers now.

02:32.734 --> 02:34.400
( <i>stamping foot</i> )

02:34.434 --> 02:36.434
Don't fight back.

02:39.567 --> 02:41.534
LOUIE:
Looked like you, Iggy.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.000
Thanks, boss.

02:44.534 --> 02:46.300
Now, back to
your daughter.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.367
How old was she

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
when your wife
pulled out with her?

02:48.434 --> 02:51.734
Hey, Louie, I wouldn't
discuss the weather with you.

02:51.767 --> 02:52.901
What makes you think
I would discuss

02:52.934 --> 02:54.801
the personal facts
of my life?

02:54.834 --> 02:56.133
Listen, go easy on me here.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.334
Would you just
get away from me?

02:57.367 --> 02:59.434
I'm trying to do this gentle.

03:01.767 --> 03:04.667
I know something
that would break your heart.

03:04.701 --> 03:05.667
Oh, yeah?
What do you know?

03:05.701 --> 03:07.067
All right, let's
proceed my way and...

03:07.100 --> 03:08.067
No, no, just tell me
what you know.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.100
Just tell me
what you know.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.234
Let's do it my way.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.267
My way or no way.
You just tell me...

03:11.300 --> 03:12.901
My way or no way!

03:12.934 --> 03:14.400
All right, your way.

03:14.434 --> 03:15.767
All right.

03:15.801 --> 03:17.667
Your daughter...

03:17.701 --> 03:19.801
what are you listening to,
Banta?

03:19.834 --> 03:21.701
I could be here
if I want to, Louie.

03:21.734 --> 03:22.968
No, you can't.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.501
This is America, Louie.

03:24.534 --> 03:25.801
No, it isn't!

03:25.834 --> 03:26.801
It isn't?

03:26.834 --> 03:28.267
No!

03:28.300 --> 03:30.434
This garage is Louie Land.

03:30.467 --> 03:33.434
You want to go to America?

03:33.467 --> 03:35.434
Go outside.

03:35.467 --> 03:39.033
I'll be over here
if you need me, Alex.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.067
Yeah, so?

03:41.100 --> 03:43.300
So how old
was your daughter

03:43.334 --> 03:45.434
when your wife
pulled out?

03:46.968 --> 03:49.100
All right, she was two.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.534
Two.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.334
Hey, what are you
getting at?

03:53.367 --> 03:54.267
Alex, he doesn't
know anything.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.634
What are you letting him
do this to you for?

03:55.667 --> 03:57.567
No, no, no, I think
he knows something.

03:57.601 --> 04:01.601
His eyes are bulging
like a frog's in heat.

04:01.634 --> 04:05.601
Rieger, you're smart
to notice this.

04:05.634 --> 04:08.434
Stick around, Nardo.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.634
He's going to need
your ample bosom

04:10.667 --> 04:12.067
to cry on
in a second.

04:14.534 --> 04:19.100
Rieger...

04:19.132 --> 04:21.466
your daughter's gettin' married

04:21.500 --> 04:24.267
and the wedding is here
in New York City,

04:24.300 --> 04:26.601
and she didn't even
invite the man

04:26.634 --> 04:28.534
whose glands
gave her birth.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.200
Take care
of him, honey.

04:31.467 --> 04:32.934
Wait a minute.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.934
How do you know that?

04:34.968 --> 04:36.267
Here.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.934
Read it for yourself.

04:37.968 --> 04:39.634
Right under the roach.

04:41.033 --> 04:42.334
All right.

04:42.367 --> 04:46.367
Her boyfriend's father
is a UN ambassador.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.734
I see it.

04:48.767 --> 04:50.400
You raise a kid,

04:50.434 --> 04:54.167
you give them two
of the best years of your life,

04:54.200 --> 04:57.200
and they wind up
forgetting you.

04:57.234 --> 04:59.367
That's why
I hate kids.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.968
It's like Ma always said:

05:01.000 --> 05:02.601
"You're better off
raising tomatoes.

05:02.634 --> 05:03.734
You can eat 'em."

05:05.667 --> 05:06.701
All right, all right,

05:06.734 --> 05:07.901
come on, come on,
leave him alone.

05:07.934 --> 05:08.901
He'll work it
out somehow.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.300
Come on! Let's get
some cabs on the road.

05:10.334 --> 05:13.801
Banta? Nardo, Nardo!
Wheeler! Come on.

05:13.834 --> 05:15.834
Rieger, you snapped
out of it yet?

05:15.868 --> 05:17.501
Come on, it's not like
it's money. Come on.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.968
Louie, will you
knock it off? Huh?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Give the guy
some room.

05:20.033 --> 05:21.834
You okay, Alex?

05:21.868 --> 05:25.434
All right, will you stop making
such a big deal about this, huh?

05:25.467 --> 05:26.767
Go on, go to work.
Go to work.

05:26.801 --> 05:28.234
Will you go to work?

05:28.267 --> 05:29.734
Come on, no kidding.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.100
You heard the man.

05:31.133 --> 05:32.801
Look, I... she lives in Brazil.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.734
I saw her that one time
in the past few years.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.834
All right, so she doesn't want
me at the wedding. Big deal.

05:38.868 --> 05:40.400
Oh, now, don't assume
she doesn't want you.

05:40.434 --> 05:41.934
I mean, it could've been
some foul-up in the mail.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.033
Oh, please, Elaine.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.667
Rio De Janeiro to here--
do you know how far that is?

05:45.701 --> 05:47.100
REVEREND JIM:
Six thousand...

05:47.133 --> 05:50.434
eight hundred and
forty-two miles.

05:53.634 --> 05:55.100
Well...

05:55.133 --> 05:58.834
do you know what kind
of mail system they must have?

05:58.868 --> 06:01.267
The Brazilian mail system

06:01.300 --> 06:03.601
is government-run

06:03.634 --> 06:11.868
with an annual budget
of 27,485,000 pesetas.

06:11.901 --> 06:14.267
How do you know
these things?

06:14.300 --> 06:17.667
You mean I'm right?

06:27.367 --> 06:31.434
I wasn't even sure if pesetas
was the right money.

06:31.467 --> 06:32.734
Look, before you get upset,

06:32.767 --> 06:35.834
why don't you just get
on the phone and call her?

06:35.868 --> 06:36.834
Call her?!
Yeah.

06:36.868 --> 06:37.834
Call Brazil?!
Yeah!

06:37.868 --> 06:39.868
You know how much it
costs to call Brazil?

06:44.033 --> 06:48.701
You just went to the well
once too often.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.634
Alex, please call her.
Call her.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.634
No... Look, all right.

06:51.667 --> 06:52.767
All right, all right,
all right.

06:52.801 --> 06:53.868
You're probably right.
You're probably right.

06:53.901 --> 06:55.067
I'll call her tonight.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.033
No, no, no! Not tonight!
Call her right now.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.167
What are you
talking about? I...

06:58.200 --> 06:59.968
Call her, Alex.
Go ahead.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.901
Go on.

07:00.934 --> 07:01.901
All right,
I'll call her now.

07:01.934 --> 07:02.901
ELAINE:
Good.

07:02.934 --> 07:06.334
LOUIE:
It's in this paper, too.

07:06.367 --> 07:10.167
"After honeymooning
in the Orient,

07:10.200 --> 07:14.868
"the newlyweds will return home
to their estate in Majorca--

07:14.901 --> 07:18.000
a gift to them
from the bride's father."

07:18.033 --> 07:20.501
Wow!
Nice present, Alex.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.267
Tony, I think they meant
Cathy's <i>other</i> father.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.501
( <i>low grunting</i> )

07:28.534 --> 07:30.834
Hello. Hello.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.701
Can I speak
to Cathy Consuelos, please?

07:33.734 --> 07:36.234
Well, then, can I speak
to her mother?

07:36.267 --> 07:38.467
No, no, no, please
don't put me on hold.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.801
Look, I'm calling
from New York City

07:40.834 --> 07:42.467
on a middle-class income.

07:42.501 --> 07:45.801
I-I-I assume you're
Mrs. Consuelos' secretary?

07:45.834 --> 07:47.133
Right, good.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.968
Listen, I'm Alex Rieger.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.968
I'm Cathy's natural father

07:51.000 --> 07:54.567
and I haven't received
my... my invitations yet.

07:54.601 --> 07:56.234
All right, all right, all right,
check, check, check--

07:56.267 --> 07:57.567
go ahead-- but please
check fast, will you?

07:57.601 --> 07:59.567
Check, check,
check, check...

07:59.601 --> 08:01.868
Yes, hello, yes.

08:01.901 --> 08:03.534
What... right.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.634
The natural father
speaking here, yes.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.334
What?!

08:09.367 --> 08:11.901
Who said I shouldn't be
invited?!

08:11.934 --> 08:13.334
Now, you just listen to me!

08:13.367 --> 08:14.400
You tell the mother
of that bride--

08:14.434 --> 08:15.400
I am not yelling.

08:15.434 --> 08:16.601
I am not yelling!

08:16.634 --> 08:18.434
You just tell
Mrs. Consuelos...

08:18.467 --> 08:19.601
I am not! I am not!

08:19.634 --> 08:20.934
You tell Mrs. Consuelos

08:20.968 --> 08:23.467
that she better have
those invitations there

08:23.501 --> 08:25.033
because I'm showing up!
You hear me?

08:30.167 --> 08:31.534
I think you're absolutely right

08:31.567 --> 08:33.534
in demanding
to go to the wedding.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.534
And if you're gonna take
somebody, it better be me.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.067
You?! Why?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.366
Because you need me
and I want to be there.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.067
Reel her in, Rieger.

08:42.567 --> 08:44.167
She's bitten the hook.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.167
Reel her in!

08:45.200 --> 08:46.501
Oh, come on, Louie.

08:46.534 --> 08:48.501
Reel her in, Rieger!

08:48.534 --> 08:50.534
Reel her in, Rieger!

09:05.734 --> 09:09.734
( <i>waltz playing</i> )

09:12.167 --> 09:14.634
Alex Rieger and guest.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.634
Ah, yes, I'm sorry, sir, but
your name isn't on the list.

09:17.667 --> 09:18.701
How do you know so fast?

09:18.734 --> 09:19.868
Because it's
on the list

09:19.901 --> 09:21.701
that tells me you're
not on the list.

09:21.734 --> 09:22.901
Now wait a minute.

09:22.934 --> 09:24.701
Do you know that my glands
gave birth to the bride here?!

09:24.734 --> 09:26.000
Alex...
Hmm?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.133
Just stop it.
What do you want?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.200
Now, the important thing

09:28.234 --> 09:29.234
is we get in to see
your daughter, right?

09:29.267 --> 09:30.367
We're not even invited!

09:30.400 --> 09:32.300
Let me handle it, okay?

09:32.334 --> 09:33.467
Okay.

09:42.901 --> 09:44.934
Excuse me.

09:44.968 --> 09:47.133
Do you have a light?

09:47.167 --> 09:49.234
You don't have
a cigarette.

09:49.267 --> 09:50.868
We don't need
a cigarette.

09:55.033 --> 09:57.067
Should I light it?

09:57.100 --> 09:58.534
Of course.

10:06.133 --> 10:07.701
Listen, miss...

10:07.734 --> 10:10.434
I will <i>personally</i>
be grateful to you

10:10.467 --> 10:12.000
if you would just
look the other way

10:12.033 --> 10:13.133
for the next few minutes.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.868
Elaine, Elaine,
I don't like this.

10:14.901 --> 10:17.234
My older brother here
doesn't like it

10:17.267 --> 10:19.200
when I have that...

instant chemical thing

10:21.334 --> 10:24.634
with a total stranger.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.467
I figure it's a
million-to-one shot

10:26.501 --> 10:28.367
I'll ever see you again,
but I'm going to take it.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.000
Go ahead.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.667
You are magic.

10:32.701 --> 10:35.100
Oh, uh, can we have a couple of
glasses of champagne, please?

10:35.133 --> 10:36.100
ELAINE:
Yes.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.100
Or does she have to flirt
with you, too?

10:37.133 --> 10:38.767
Let me just...
Thank you.

10:38.801 --> 10:41.200
Alex, stop being a pain
and enjoy yourself.

10:41.234 --> 10:43.868
You are obviously
with a wildly
attractive woman.

10:43.901 --> 10:46.467
Yeah...

10:46.501 --> 10:47.868
I can't figure it out,
I mean,

10:47.901 --> 10:50.334
I don't know why Phyllis
is doing this to me.

10:50.367 --> 10:53.267
I mean, it's not like her.
There's something up here.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.834
I mean, not barring me
from the wedding.

10:54.868 --> 10:56.667
Not avoiding me.

10:56.701 --> 10:58.834
She lives
for confrontations.

10:58.868 --> 11:00.501
Yeah, I think
it's terrible,

11:00.534 --> 11:02.334
and you know, maybe we
should talk about it,

11:02.367 --> 11:03.667
but you have always
been so touchy

11:03.701 --> 11:05.000
about that
ex-wife subject.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.767
She'll get around to you later.
Don't worry about it.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.067
You have always
been so touchy

11:12.100 --> 11:14.200
about the ex-wife thing
that I just naturally assumed

11:14.234 --> 11:16.033
your marriage broke up
for the obvious reasons.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.667
What do you mean:
obvious reasons?

11:18.701 --> 11:19.968
Well, that you were a heel

11:20.000 --> 11:22.200
who couldn't commit
to a wife or child.

11:22.234 --> 11:23.200
Humph!

11:23.234 --> 11:25.534
No, Elaine,
she walked out on me.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.501
Some nonsense
about being a failure.

11:27.534 --> 11:29.534
Of course, that was before
they accepted my application

11:29.567 --> 11:30.767
at the cab academy.

11:36.534 --> 11:38.534
Oh, my God.

11:40.634 --> 11:41.601
What's wrong?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.434
I think I just saw
my ex-wife.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.200
ELAINE:
That's Phyllis?

11:46.234 --> 11:48.100
Yes, I think so.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.834
It looks like she put on

11:49.868 --> 11:51.000
a couple of extra pounds
here and there...

11:51.033 --> 11:53.334
and everywhere.

11:53.367 --> 11:54.467
Mmm...

11:54.501 --> 11:56.200
Alex!

11:56.234 --> 11:57.501
Hmm?

11:57.534 --> 11:58.767
Oh, look who's... oh!

11:58.801 --> 11:59.767
Look at this!

11:59.801 --> 12:02.501
I finally found you!
Beautiful!

12:02.534 --> 12:04.968
You are gorgeous!

12:05.000 --> 12:06.701
Finally, a real welcome.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.767
What do you mean?
I have been looking
all over for you.

12:08.801 --> 12:10.868
I was afraid
you didn't make it.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.234
Are you kidding?

12:12.267 --> 12:15.367
A team of wild ex-wives
couldn't keep me away.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.133
You look... oh, excuse me.
This is Elaine.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.133
Nardo.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.133
ALEX:
Nardo.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.734
Oh, gosh, it's such
a pleasure to meet you.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.234
You look so beautiful.

12:24.267 --> 12:25.934
And without makeup.

12:25.968 --> 12:27.334
I couldn't tell from
where we were sitting,

12:27.367 --> 12:29.300
Oh, where were
you sitting?
but the detail on the dress...

12:29.334 --> 12:32.701
Oh, uh, well, we had good seats,
they were just...

12:32.734 --> 12:34.100
Way back.
High.

12:34.133 --> 12:35.200
But fine.
But fine.

12:35.234 --> 12:36.367
You were supposed to be seated

12:36.400 --> 12:38.300
on the aisle in the third row.

12:38.334 --> 12:41.000
And I wanted you to be
in the reception line with us.

12:41.033 --> 12:42.701
Didn't you get the note
with my invitation?

12:42.734 --> 12:44.467
No, no, I'm afraid
I didn't. No.

12:44.501 --> 12:47.234
Oh, I don't understand
how a mistake like
this could happen.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.634
Well, what's the difference?

12:48.667 --> 12:49.634
Here-- waiter?

12:49.667 --> 12:50.634
Come on.

12:50.667 --> 12:51.634
Huh?

12:51.667 --> 12:52.968
I want you to meet somebody.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Well, who?

12:56.601 --> 12:58.434
Oh, my God.

13:02.033 --> 13:03.601
I would like you to meet

13:03.634 --> 13:06.267
my father--
Carlo Consuelos.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.300
Father, this is my father,
Alex Rieger.

13:09.334 --> 13:11.100
It's a pleasure
meeting you at last.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.367
The pleasure is mine.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.701
( <i>laughing</i> )

13:13.734 --> 13:15.367
Hey, it's nice of you
to say that, you know that?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.667
He's a nice guy, isn't he?

13:17.701 --> 13:20.200
Mother, what are you doing
down there?

13:20.234 --> 13:24.667
Oh, I was just pulling up
his socks, dear.

13:24.701 --> 13:27.100
I'll introduce myself later.

13:28.801 --> 13:31.667
Well... look.

13:31.701 --> 13:33.300
If it isn't Alex.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.634
Hello, Phyllis.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.133
CATHY:
Mother, Alex was seated
way up in the balcony.

13:37.167 --> 13:39.267
Hey, what's the difference?
We were there, right?

13:39.300 --> 13:40.400
No, it makes a lot
of difference.

13:40.434 --> 13:41.400
I don't understand how

13:41.434 --> 13:42.834
a mistake like this
could be made,

13:42.868 --> 13:43.767
do you, Mother?

13:43.801 --> 13:47.100
( <i>mumbling</i> )

13:47.133 --> 13:48.434
Darling, why don't you go

13:48.467 --> 13:49.901
take your place
in the reception line.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.834
There are people who are just
hugging and crying

13:51.868 --> 13:54.000
over another little girl
in a white dress.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.267
Go, go. Go, go.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.601
See you later.
That's good.

13:58.033 --> 14:00.701
Well... Alex...

14:00.734 --> 14:03.667
18 years, and at last,

14:03.701 --> 14:06.234
a terribly
uncomfortable moment.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.567
What's wrong with you?

14:07.601 --> 14:09.734
How come I wasn't invited
to the wedding?!

14:09.767 --> 14:12.100
Alex, can't we
just chat first?

14:12.133 --> 14:14.801
I mean, we have so
much to talk about.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.567
I mean, your life
has changed dramatically

14:17.601 --> 14:18.968
since I knew you.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.467
I hear they have those
electronic meters now.

14:21.501 --> 14:23.400
( <i>stammering</i> )

14:23.434 --> 14:25.100
Hello.
I'm Elaine Nardo.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.234
This is a
beautiful wedding.

14:26.267 --> 14:27.734
You must be so happy.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.868
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

14:30.901 --> 14:33.033
Yes, I said that
I'm Elaine Nardo.

14:33.067 --> 14:33.968
Yes?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.133
And this is
a beautiful wedding.

14:38.167 --> 14:40.100
Did you say
you were with him?

14:40.133 --> 14:44.033
Uh, no, actually, I didn't,
but, yes, I am with Alex.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.267
Oh.

14:48.534 --> 14:51.634
He and I work together
at the garage.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.234
Oh, you mean
you're a cab driver?

14:54.267 --> 14:56.400
Yes, well, I also work
in an art gallery,

14:56.434 --> 14:58.400
but, yes, I am
a cab driver.

14:58.434 --> 14:59.801
Oh, of course.

14:59.834 --> 15:01.267
There <i>must</i> be
female cab drivers.

15:01.300 --> 15:06.033
I mean, where else would all the
little cab drivers come from?

15:06.067 --> 15:09.167
( <i>laughing</i> )

15:10.667 --> 15:13.334
It wasn't your fault.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.868
How come
I wasn't invited?

15:16.901 --> 15:19.067
I didn't want you there.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.601
Oh.

15:23.534 --> 15:25.400
All right, look, I don't want
to hold the line any longer.

15:25.434 --> 15:27.534
I'll just, uh...

15:27.567 --> 15:29.167
I'll just say congratulations
and good luck

15:29.200 --> 15:31.667
and, uh, remember,
you haven't lost a daughter,

15:31.701 --> 15:33.133
you've gained a ton.

15:37.033 --> 15:39.000
Phyllis, I was just...
I was just joking.

15:39.033 --> 15:40.000
Hello. Hello.

15:40.033 --> 15:41.501
I was just joking.
It was just a joke.

15:41.534 --> 15:43.033
Hi. How are you?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.067
ALEX:
Phyll!

15:49.567 --> 15:51.467
Phyll... eh...

15:51.501 --> 15:52.601
Alex,
Huh?

15:52.634 --> 15:53.801
what happened
with Mother?

15:53.834 --> 15:55.567
Nothing. Nothing.
We just had a chat.

15:55.601 --> 15:57.067
Alex, she's acting
real strange

15:57.100 --> 15:59.067
and I think I
figured out why.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.968
You know, she's
gained a few pounds,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
and she's so
vain about it.

16:02.434 --> 16:03.400
Oh, yeah.

16:03.434 --> 16:05.534
I think she was afraid
of what you might say

16:05.567 --> 16:06.834
if you saw her like this.

16:06.868 --> 16:08.667
Oh...

16:08.701 --> 16:10.467
Oh, but that's crazy.

16:10.501 --> 16:12.868
You wouldn't say anything
about her weight, would you?

16:12.901 --> 16:15.934
No, no, no...
I wouldn't. No.

16:24.868 --> 16:26.567
Why do I feel terrible?

16:26.601 --> 16:28.100
I was shut out of my
daughter's wedding,

16:28.133 --> 16:29.701
shut out of
the reception;

16:29.734 --> 16:31.033
my profession
has been ridiculed

16:31.067 --> 16:33.434
to an extent
approaching... truth,

16:33.467 --> 16:34.868
so why do I feel guilty?

16:34.901 --> 16:37.300
Because you hurt a woman
you once loved

16:37.334 --> 16:38.868
on the most important
night of her life?

16:38.901 --> 16:41.000
No, that's not it.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.067
Because your daughter
will sense her mother's hurt

16:43.100 --> 16:45.100
and it'll spoil
the one evening

16:45.133 --> 16:46.701
that's supposed
to be perfect.

16:46.734 --> 16:49.901
That's the one.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.000
Think I better go over there.

16:52.033 --> 16:54.267
That's a very strange thing
you have a talent for, Elaine,

16:54.300 --> 16:55.501
you know that?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.434
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

16:59.467 --> 17:01.501
Excuse me, uh, may
I cut in, please?

17:01.534 --> 17:02.534
PHYLLIS:
Don't let him.

17:05.367 --> 17:06.968
May-May I cut in, please?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.567
He looks like
a bad dancer.

17:09.601 --> 17:12.534
Phyllis, we have something
to talk about.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.200
Of course, Mr. Rieger.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.300
You two should talk.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.534
Thank you.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.601
A fine gentleman.

17:18.634 --> 17:20.434
Come on, Phyllis,
let's dance.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.434
No... No...

17:21.467 --> 17:22.434
Come on, Phyllis,
let's dance.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.434
No!

17:23.467 --> 17:24.501
Everybody's watching.

17:24.534 --> 17:26.032
Just dance with me, please.
Just dance with me.

17:26.067 --> 17:28.267
This goes here.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.667
Now, come on.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.367
Aha! You've been sneaking out

17:34.400 --> 17:36.634
and taking dancing lessons,
haven't you?

17:36.667 --> 17:38.767
What is the point of this?

17:38.801 --> 17:40.300
I was afraid I may
have hurt your feelings.

17:40.334 --> 17:41.868
You <i>wish</i> you could
hurt my feelings.

17:41.901 --> 17:42.868
Look, if I hurt
your feelings...

17:42.901 --> 17:43.868
You didn't hurt
my feelings.

17:43.901 --> 17:44.801
I'm sorry I hurt
your feelings.

17:44.834 --> 17:45.834
You're not sorry
you hurt my feelings.

17:45.868 --> 17:46.801
Then I did hurt
your feelings.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.100
Did I hurt
your feelings?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.100
Yes, you hurt
my feelings.
You have no feelings.

17:49.133 --> 17:50.834
Am I crazy,
or was that fun?

17:50.868 --> 17:52.334
No, it's not fun.
None of this is fun.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.834
Leave me the hell alone.

17:53.868 --> 17:56.234
Phyllis, come on,
we're acting crazy.

17:56.267 --> 17:58.267
We were once married.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.701
Look, I just want
to talk to you

17:59.734 --> 18:02.033
for five minutes alone
in that room, okay?

18:02.067 --> 18:03.300
Come on.

18:03.334 --> 18:05.501
You get your hands off me

18:05.534 --> 18:08.100
or I'll charge you
for half this wedding.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.601
No.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.734
Okay.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.467
( <i>coughs</i> )

18:33.467 --> 18:35.868
Um...
( <i>laughs</i> )

18:35.901 --> 18:39.033
Gee, just like
our old apartment.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.601
What a nice touch.

18:42.634 --> 18:44.701
Did you plan this
this way?

18:44.734 --> 18:48.200
Phyllis, look, I made some
remarks about your appearance

18:48.234 --> 18:49.901
and I didn't mean them.

18:49.934 --> 18:54.801
I mean, look, it was...
I was just angry

18:54.834 --> 18:56.968
because you didn't invite me
to the wedding.

18:57.000 --> 18:57.934
But you really
look terrific

18:57.968 --> 19:00.133
and I'm glad we saw
each other again.

19:04.334 --> 19:06.934
You took me
all the way in here

19:06.968 --> 19:10.501
to do what you had to do
as badly as you just did it?

19:10.534 --> 19:13.133
I mean,
I have Kleenex

19:13.167 --> 19:15.701
in my purse getting
ready for this moment.

19:16.701 --> 19:18.334
What was that you said?

19:18.367 --> 19:20.767
"I was mad,
and I didn't mean it"?

19:20.801 --> 19:22.434
That's the truth.
What do you want me to say?

19:22.467 --> 19:25.200
No, it was fine
what you said.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
Are we finished?
I can't tell.

19:30.934 --> 19:32.968
You would think that
after 18 years,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.501
you could stop
criticizing me.

19:34.534 --> 19:36.701
Wouldn't you?

19:39.801 --> 19:41.701
After 18 years,
you wouldn't think

19:41.734 --> 19:44.033
that you could still
make me crazy.

19:44.067 --> 19:47.133
Would you?

19:47.167 --> 19:48.934
Come on, Phyllis.
Come on.

19:48.968 --> 19:51.033
Okay, look,
we come in here

19:51.067 --> 19:53.267
and you tell me
I look terrific?

19:53.300 --> 19:55.267
I'm 18 years older.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.000
I'm 30 pounds heavier.

19:58.033 --> 20:00.434
You know, I've let
this dress out three times.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.567
It's a month old.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.667
I mean, this
is all recent.

20:05.701 --> 20:07.267
You know, I was nervous
before the wedding.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.667
I started eating.

20:08.701 --> 20:10.200
What were you
nervous about?

20:10.234 --> 20:11.868
Having gained 27 pounds

20:11.901 --> 20:13.834
since we last
saw each other.

20:13.868 --> 20:16.200
( <i>laughing</i> )

20:18.067 --> 20:20.234
You still have
that great sense...
That great sense of humor.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.200
I hate being mimicked.
I hate it!

20:24.868 --> 20:25.901
You still do, huh?

20:25.934 --> 20:26.968
Yes, I do, yes.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.801
You mean the same old
things still annoy you?

20:29.834 --> 20:30.801
Yes.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.501
( <i>laughs</i> )

20:33.534 --> 20:35.634
Aw...

20:35.667 --> 20:37.634
( <i>squeaky</i> ):
Whoa-whoa...!

20:37.667 --> 20:41.100
You stop that,
stop that, stop that.
Testing; just testing.

20:41.133 --> 20:42.300
Just testing.

20:42.334 --> 20:44.634
Yes, the same old things
annoy me, yes.

20:44.667 --> 20:45.868
( <i>clears throat</i> )

20:47.701 --> 20:49.334
( <i>chuckling</i> )

20:49.367 --> 20:50.334
What were you
just thinking?

20:50.367 --> 20:51.334
Nah, no, nothing.

20:51.367 --> 20:52.367
No, come on, what
were you thinking?

20:52.400 --> 20:53.434
No, no, no.

20:53.467 --> 20:54.467
I wasn't thinking about
the things that annoy me.

20:54.501 --> 20:55.767
I was thinking about, uh,

20:55.801 --> 21:01.400
some of the nice things;
some of the, ah, well...

21:01.434 --> 21:03.300
Why, Alex...
Eh?

21:03.334 --> 21:05.434
what a dirty little
mind we have.

21:05.467 --> 21:07.868
No, no, no, no, no.
It wasn't dirty.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.968
I was just thinking about
some of the, you know,

21:10.000 --> 21:10.868
the things that, uh...

21:10.901 --> 21:12.667
I know exactly what
you were thinking.

21:12.701 --> 21:13.701
Oh, yeah?
What was I thinking?

21:13.734 --> 21:14.767
Yeah, I know exactly.
All right, what?

21:14.801 --> 21:16.167
You were thinking...

21:18.367 --> 21:20.434
I was not.
No, I know.

21:20.467 --> 21:21.534
I got it,
I got it, okay?

21:21.567 --> 21:22.534
Oh, yeah? What?

21:22.567 --> 21:23.534
Come here.
What?!

21:23.567 --> 21:25.300
Come here.
What?!

21:27.968 --> 21:31.467
Lucky guess. Hah.

21:31.501 --> 21:33.300
( <i>laughing</i> ):
You...

21:36.234 --> 21:37.734
But it's true, huh?

21:39.067 --> 21:42.033
I mean... the physical part
of our relationship

21:42.067 --> 21:45.334
was always pretty fair, huh?

21:45.367 --> 21:46.534
Good.

21:46.567 --> 21:47.701
Good?

21:47.734 --> 21:49.968
Great! It was great!

21:50.000 --> 21:51.334
Yeah, we always knew how

21:51.367 --> 21:52.934
to push each other's buttons,
didn't we?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.634
But now I don't know

21:58.667 --> 22:02.634
whether I can push
anybody's buttons anymore...

22:02.667 --> 22:05.267
or anybody can
push my buttons.

22:07.434 --> 22:10.934
Or find my buttons anymore.

22:16.667 --> 22:20.400
Well, listen, if they ever
get up a search party...

22:20.434 --> 22:23.067
Oh, Alex...

22:23.100 --> 22:25.067
you are so sweet.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.067
( <i>laughing</i> )

22:28.100 --> 22:29.501
Oh, Phyllis,

22:29.534 --> 22:31.367
it's really great
being able

22:31.400 --> 22:32.501
to say good-bye
this way, you know?

22:32.534 --> 22:35.100
Oh, I know.
I'm so glad.

22:40.501 --> 22:42.767
Phyllis, Phyllis...

22:42.801 --> 22:43.734
Phyllis, come on.

22:43.767 --> 22:44.968
Mm, mm...

22:45.000 --> 22:46.868
No, Phyllis...

22:46.901 --> 22:50.133
 <i>Oh,</i> Phyllis, no...

22:50.167 --> 22:53.200
Ooh, ow, ooh...

22:53.234 --> 22:55.634
( <i>both moaning</i> )

23:01.968 --> 23:03.400
Oh, and to think

23:03.434 --> 23:06.934
I didn't want you
to be at this wedding.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.534
CATHY:
Mother! Alex!

23:09.567 --> 23:11.567
They said you
came this way!

23:12.801 --> 23:15.634
I'm cutting the cake.

23:15.667 --> 23:16.634
Hi, kid.

23:16.667 --> 23:17.634
Well...

23:17.667 --> 23:19.501
This is the best gift

23:19.534 --> 23:21.367
I could've received--

23:21.400 --> 23:23.133
seeing you two
together.

23:23.167 --> 23:25.534
Yeah, well, five minutes later,
you would've had a better gift.

23:32.601 --> 23:36.367
You know what I'd
really like to see?

23:36.400 --> 23:38.367
You two hugging each other.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.334
Oh, come on, come on,
Cathy, please...

23:41.367 --> 23:42.501
Oh, come on, you can do it.

23:42.534 --> 23:44.000
Cathy...
For me?

23:47.300 --> 23:48.834
CATHY:
Come on.

23:48.868 --> 23:49.934
All right.

23:49.968 --> 23:50.934
For the kid.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.400
Come on.

23:58.467 --> 24:01.334
( <i>laughing</i> )

24:01.367 --> 24:04.767
Whoa, we're just being crazy,
you know?

24:06.767 --> 24:08.667
And thank you.

24:08.701 --> 24:11.000
You're welcome.

24:13.634 --> 24:15.701
Come on.

24:15.734 --> 24:18.434
Let's get back
to the wedding.

Come on.
Come on.
