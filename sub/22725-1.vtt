01:58.916 --> 02:01.000
My fellow people,
we are here today...

02:01.041 --> 02:04.041
...to pay our final respects to
Mr. Ismet Hanoglu--

02:04.166 --> 02:05.708
Hello everybody.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.416
OK. Move over.
Go stand there.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.250
This world is a test.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.166
-This is my spot.
-Dude, move over.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.833
-Dude, just move.
-No. This is my spot.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.625
-Leave me alone.
-You're in my face.

02:18.708 --> 02:20.333
Piss off.

02:20.708 --> 02:24.333
You're grown men.
Don't fight like children.

02:24.375 --> 02:27.375
Sir, he's too ambitious for his height.
He still insists to stand in the front.

02:27.416 --> 02:30.000
As if he'll be more blessed
when he stands here.

02:30.041 --> 02:32.000
May. God...

02:32.041 --> 02:33.375
-Move back.
-Leave!

02:33.458 --> 02:34.708
-Just move.
-Go away.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.458
...bless us with his heaven.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.125
Hey, look.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.625
You move back.
You are taller anyway.

02:41.708 --> 02:43.625
Just move.
Be the bigger man. Go.

02:43.708 --> 02:45.416
But I am always the bigger man.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.666
Let him be the bigger man.
For once I want to stay in the front.

02:48.791 --> 02:51.083
May God absolve him from all his sins.

02:51.208 --> 02:54.166
This funeral will be over soon.
Then we will have a talk.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.833
-Sir, he's threatening me.
-Enough!

02:55.875 --> 02:56.958
I will kick you both out.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.208
Now pray for the deceased.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.000
Pray.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.333
Why don't you pray?
I told you to pray.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.666
Sir, they're not praying.
I'm the only one.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.250
My condolences to you.

03:12.291 --> 03:15.708
-Would you like halva?
-Yes, halva. Here.

03:20.666 --> 03:22.208
What kind of halva is this?

03:22.291 --> 03:24.166
What? Let me see.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.791
I won't eat this. Excuse me.
Come here.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.291
Come on.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.458
What did you make this with?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.166
-With butter.
-Are you sure?

03:31.250 --> 03:33.666
-I swear, it's butter.
-Well, we'll see.

03:47.041 --> 03:48.500
There's no butter in it.

03:49.916 --> 03:51.583
There's no way I'll eat this.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.291
I'm not eating it. Take it away.
Shame on you.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.166
I expected better from a housewife like you.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.208
We should have eaten Ismet's halva.

03:58.250 --> 04:01.375
We've come here to eat Ismet's halva
but this is far from edible.

04:01.625 --> 04:04.375
This guy passes away
for the first time in his life.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.125
The man dies only once.

04:06.208 --> 04:09.250
Make a proper halva.
You had only one job.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.583
You do it one time.

04:10.666 --> 04:11.708
You're right.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.583
My deceased mother used to make
a great halva.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.708
That much is obvious.

04:15.791 --> 04:18.583
Your mother sculpted
this ugly piece with her great food.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.708
Look at your man boobs.
These look like marshmallows.

04:21.791 --> 04:24.625
Your boobs are bigger than
all the women's in here. Shame!

04:24.750 --> 04:27.166
I bet there's moss under them.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.458
We're in a funeral house.
Mind what you are saying.

04:29.583 --> 04:32.041
Come on, let's give our condolences
then leave.

04:32.208 --> 04:33.041
Hurry.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.458
Our condolences.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.083
Ma'am, we are leaving if it's OK.

04:37.166 --> 04:40.375
The visits to funeral houses should be short.
There's already too many women here.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.916
Thank you. God bless you.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.208
God bless all of us.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.166
He was a great man, ma'am.
He loved you very much.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.583
He always talked about you and his love.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.666
He was very fond of you.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.708
He used to say
"I wouldn't give her away for all the riches."

04:54.750 --> 04:56.541
Then I would say, "What? What riches?

04:56.583 --> 04:58.958
I wouldn't even pay five bucks for her."
Every single time.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.166
-What the hell are you talking about, Recep?
-He's gone all of a sudden.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.208
Let me tell you something, ma'am.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.500
He didn't take care of his body
in his last years.

05:06.625 --> 05:10.083
He drank a lot.
He was regularly visiting night clubs.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.291
He was having illegitimate children.
He always had a VIP room in night clubs.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.916
Recep, what are you talking about?
It's not the time or the place.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.750
We were very close lately.
That's how I know.

05:18.833 --> 05:22.000
How come?
Ismet was an international truck driver.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.708
How did you see each other?
He was always on the road.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.250
You see? He tricked her as well.

05:26.291 --> 05:29.000
He was sleeping around
when he said he was on the road.

05:29.041 --> 05:32.125
Don't make me open the closet.
I know what we have done together.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.166
He was always sleeping around
but he was never on the road.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.875
Lately he got out of hand.
He got into S&M stuff.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.875
He wore collars and
got himself whipped.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.333
He said he was a masochist.
Even this guy whipped him.

05:43.416 --> 05:44.708
He whipped him several times.
Tell her.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.875
What are you talking about, Recep?
Sorry, ma'am.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.708
He doesn't know what he is saying.
We loved Ismet so much.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.416
May he rest in peace.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.583
Is there anything we can do for you?

05:53.958 --> 05:55.958
Thank you, God bless.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.333
He had made an agreement with a group.

05:58.416 --> 06:01.750
Now who will take them,
what will happen I don't know.

06:01.791 --> 06:03.291
I don't know what to do.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.875
What group is this, ma'am?

06:04.916 --> 06:06.750
A sports group.

06:06.916 --> 06:08.833
-Did you get paid?
-Yes, we did.

06:08.916 --> 06:11.916
-Did you spend it all?
-It has covered the funeral expenses.

06:12.750 --> 06:13.875
Then...

06:14.166 --> 06:15.791
...we should take them.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.166
If you have the keys and everything...

06:18.250 --> 06:20.375
...then we can take the group
to their destination.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.333
God bless you. I have them.

06:22.500 --> 06:26.291
-Ma'am, where were they supposed to go?
-Somewhere far away.

06:26.333 --> 06:29.083
Skopje or something, I'm not sure.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.291
Skopje, OK. I know it.
I know Skopje very well.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.916
It's... It's in the middle of Anatolia.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.291
I know it very well.
Skopje Göreme.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.750
The one with the chimneys...
The place with the fairy chimneys.

06:37.833 --> 06:40.041
-I know it well.
-You're mistaken, Recep. It's not it.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.833
Definitely, yes. I know it.
Skopje Göreme, OK.

06:41.875 --> 06:44.125
You shut up. I'll take them.
OK, ma'am.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.375
Don't you worry.
OK, Skopje Göreme. Nice.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.833
If you have any contact number,
give them to us...

06:48.875 --> 06:51.166
...and we'll handle it.

06:58.875 --> 07:01.916
Look at us. We are here,
driving a bus because of you.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.000
You keep complaining.
OK, don't come. Just don't.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.291
-I'll take care of it.
-Look at his attitude.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.541
The fatty is giving me an attitude.

07:08.666 --> 07:10.625
He's giving me an attitude
as if he were my girlfriend.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.833
Don't make me hit you in the face.

07:12.916 --> 07:16.041
I'm a man of my word.
I won't sell out my friends.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.000
Thanks man. Appreciated.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.250
Where is this bus, Akif?
Look at the time.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.625
Sir, they must be stuck in the traffic.
It should be here soon.

07:22.791 --> 07:24.791
But Akif, that's not OK.
Look at the time.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.833
Everything has to be punctual.

07:30.291 --> 07:31.375
There it is.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.541
It is but it's late. What time is it?

07:33.625 --> 07:36.458
If I say 14:33, it should be here at 14:33.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.083
They should be here by the minute.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.291
-Are they them?
-Yes, they are.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.541
-They're waiting for us.
-How can you be so sure?

07:45.708 --> 07:47.458
Because they are all in tracksuits.
Don't you see?

07:47.541 --> 07:49.666
Dude, is everyone
with a tracksuit waiting for you?

07:50.041 --> 07:52.416
Do you think every group
in tracksuits is waiting for you?

07:52.458 --> 07:54.291
Tell me the number.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.375
Who is this?

08:02.416 --> 08:03.583
-Hello?
-Hello.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.166
-Hello, yes? Who is this?
-You tell me. I called you.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.041
Yes, you did call me.
Who is this?

08:08.083 --> 08:11.625
-I'm calling Hakan. Mr. Hakan.
-Yes, that's me. Good grief.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.458
Hold on, let's get out.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.833
I was calling you about the sports group.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.333
I would like to speak with
the head of the group, Mr. Hakan.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.833
Are you the gentleman
in the grey suit and a red tie?

08:23.916 --> 08:24.791
Yes, that's me.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.583
-With the curly hair, like a clown's?
-Yes, that's me. God's sake!

08:27.625 --> 08:29.875
Then hang up! Why are we on the phone
when we are face to face.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.666
I'm paying for it. God!

08:31.750 --> 08:33.041
Who the hell are you?

08:33.082 --> 08:34.707
Hello. I am Recep Ivedik.

08:34.750 --> 08:37.416
And this is my right hand man,
my assistant, my head consultant...

08:37.457 --> 08:39.457
...and also my back up driver Nurullah.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
Say hello to the gentleman.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.625
-Hello, chief.
-Chief? God!

08:42.707 --> 08:44.416
Chief of what?
Akif, what's going on here?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.166
-Where's Ismet?
-Mr. Ismet won't be able to come.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.375
He is on another journey.
That's why we are here.

08:48.416 --> 08:50.250
-What journey?
-His final journey.

08:50.416 --> 08:53.250
He's gone to meet his creator.
We have lost him.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.500
-He passed away.
-So what?

08:55.541 --> 08:57.750
It is none of my business.
Did he ask for my permission? No.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.125
I need to know everything.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.250
Akif, what is his nonsense?

09:01.291 --> 09:02.208
Good grief.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.541
Is this a circus?

09:03.583 --> 09:05.208
Two jerks have come here.

09:06.791 --> 09:07.958
Stop right there!

09:08.000 --> 09:10.916
You can't talk to me like that!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.250
You clown! Have some respect.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.250
Don't be so aggressive.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.708
Don't make me lose my temper.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.833
Or else I'll straighten your hair!

09:18.916 --> 09:20.958
-Sir, please calm down.
-Tell him to mind his words.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.333
You can't tell me what to do.
You can't talk to me like that.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.416
Who the hell are you?

09:24.500 --> 09:26.333
-Please, let's not get tense.
-Put your hand down.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.625
How can I entrust these people to you?

09:28.666 --> 09:31.750
God's sake!
These are all national athletes.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.708
So what if they're national?
So what?

09:33.750 --> 09:35.833
I am, too! Since I was 15.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.375
And him, since he was 27.
So what?

09:38.458 --> 09:40.875
We wrestled with a lady.
What's the deal?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.833
Good for you!
Are you getting on or not?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.291
I'll leave you here.
You won't be able to go at all.

09:46.458 --> 09:49.208
Do you have a driver's license?
Let me see it.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.125
Good grief.
I've had enough of this guy.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.500
What a joke.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.875
Here. Here. See?

09:56.041 --> 09:57.875
I have all kinds of licenses. Here.

09:57.916 --> 10:00.916
A, A1, B1, B2, B3, B4, B7.

10:00.958 --> 10:04.500
Omega-3, M, T. I even have an S.

10:04.541 --> 10:07.000
What is S? What is T?
What are you talking about?

10:07.041 --> 10:08.666
S, Skorsky...

10:08.708 --> 10:10.833
...Submarine,
I can drive anything.

10:10.875 --> 10:13.000
OK, come on.
The clock is ticking.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.416
I will charge you extra
for every hour, every mile.

10:15.458 --> 10:16.708
I swear. Come on, hurry up.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.833
-Do you know the route?
-I do know the route.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.333
What's with the questions?
I know it.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.041
We've even drawn the road map.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.000
I will go through the Konya Plains...

10:24.041 --> 10:26.750
...and after Aksehir,
I will pass Nevsehir...

10:26.791 --> 10:28.750
...and when we see the chimney of the fairy,
that's Skopje Göreme.

10:28.791 --> 10:30.458
Nevsehir? Aksehir? What?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.666
That's Ürgüp you're talking about.
We're going to Skopje.

10:32.708 --> 10:34.583
Skopje, Macedonia, Europe.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.416
-Macedonia?
-Yes.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.291
Why wasn't I told about this, Nurullah?

10:38.333 --> 10:41.208
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
You never listen.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.291
OK, no problem.
We can go to Macedonia as well.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.666
Akif, gather everyone.
Get them on the bus.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.500
By the way, when we're back in Istanbul...

10:48.541 --> 10:50.666
...you'll give me an answer for
you've done here.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.458
OK, good boy. Let's go.

10:53.541 --> 10:54.541
Come on.

11:03.416 --> 11:04.916
Salih!

11:06.541 --> 11:07.666
What's going on, Recep?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.666
Give me my passport and everything.
You have them.

11:09.708 --> 11:11.250
-Where to, Recep?
-To somewhere.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.833
What's it to you?

11:12.875 --> 11:15.000
Are you the customs officer?

11:15.750 --> 11:17.125
Salih!

11:17.208 --> 11:19.916
-Prepare something for the road.
-OK, Recep.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.708
Give me the microphone.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.458
My dear national brothers and sisters...

11:35.500 --> 11:40.416
...we'll continue our journey
passing through Tekirdag...

11:40.458 --> 11:43.833
...Malkara, and then Kesan.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.333
We'll leave the country
through Ipsala border gate...

11:47.375 --> 11:50.791
...and enter the Greek lands.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.708
What nonsense!

11:53.750 --> 11:56.583
I can't believe how joyful I'm today!

11:56.625 --> 11:59.875
I hope nothing bad comes out of it.
They say there is sorrow in every joy.

11:59.916 --> 12:02.666
I hope it'll be different for us.
I wish you safe travels.

12:02.791 --> 12:05.416
Well then.
Time for the complimentary tea and coffee.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.250
Take this back.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.500
Are you ready?

12:08.583 --> 12:09.791
Ready for what?

12:09.833 --> 12:11.083
Haven't you prepared the drinks?

12:11.125 --> 12:14.333
-I haven't prepared anything.
-Man, who is the assistant here?

12:14.416 --> 12:16.166
Do you expect me to prepare them?

12:16.333 --> 12:18.041
Do you want me to drive or
prepare the drinks?

12:18.416 --> 12:20.208
What kind of an assistant are you?

12:20.291 --> 12:22.333
What kind of an assistant are you?

12:24.041 --> 12:25.791
Come. Come here.

12:26.458 --> 12:27.833
-Come.
-What are you doing?

12:27.875 --> 12:29.291
Here. Go around my back.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.791
Sir! What are you doing?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.375
I'm still hitting the gas pedal.
Around my back.

12:32.416 --> 12:35.416
-What the hell are you doing?
-Around my back, damn it!

12:35.500 --> 12:37.041
What are you doing?

12:37.083 --> 12:39.291
-I can't see the road!
-I'm stuck!

12:39.458 --> 12:41.416
I can't get my feet free!

12:41.500 --> 12:43.458
-I can't see the road!
-How am I going to get out?

12:43.541 --> 12:45.458
You're making my ass take the wheel.

12:45.541 --> 12:47.750
My ass is driving the bus right now.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.250
There is a semi coming!
You'll kill us!

12:51.625 --> 12:53.541
Look up! Take the wheel!

12:53.833 --> 12:56.500
OK, don't panic. Don't panic.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.416
Go a little faster.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.166
You're driving like a granny.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.625
Nurullah! Nurullah! Hey!

13:20.291 --> 13:22.500
-Dude, what are you doing?
-I must have dozed off.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.250
Dozed off? You are driving the bus!

13:24.541 --> 13:27.500
Idiot. I'll bash your skull in, I swear.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.250
We are doing 55-60.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.416
"55-60" he says.
You must be dreaming still.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.791
I'm getting hungry.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.000
-Are you, too?
-I won't say no.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.375
You never say no to food.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.416
You eat everything you can, Nurullah.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.791
You were told to eat often
with small portions...

13:45.833 --> 13:48.375
...but you eat often
with gigantic portions!

13:49.625 --> 13:51.791
Let me take a look at my calendar.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.291
What's that? Kakader?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.041
Karaambar Truck Driver's Union.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.458
Ka Ka Der.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.208
The only union I'm a member of since 2008.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.625
Wow, it's the first time I've heard this.

14:00.666 --> 14:03.875
Let me see if there is one on the way.

14:03.916 --> 14:05.708
Oh, there is one! Malkara.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.458
In Malkara! God! Malkara!

14:08.500 --> 14:10.875
Yes! In Malkara!

14:10.958 --> 14:14.583
We'll eat the best rice and beans, Nurullah.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.708
I will ask the kids if anyone is hungry.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.166
So kids, are we hungry?

14:21.208 --> 14:22.291
Yes!

14:22.333 --> 14:24.750
Would you like to eat a nice bean meal...

14:24.791 --> 14:26.416
...before we leave our beautiful country?

14:26.458 --> 14:27.458
Yes!

14:27.500 --> 14:29.708
-How about some rice and beans?
-Yes!

14:29.791 --> 14:32.541
No, mister. I won't allow it.
God's sake!

14:32.583 --> 14:34.583
-They say they want to.
-These kids can't eat...

14:34.625 --> 14:36.083
...in unknown places.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.333
Guys, I apologize. Forget about the beans.
Your leader won't allow us.

14:39.375 --> 14:45.041
Boo! Beans! Beans! Beans!

14:45.208 --> 14:46.875
It's not time for the meal, no!

14:46.916 --> 14:49.416
Beans! Beans! Beans!

14:49.458 --> 14:52.625
You can't stand against people's will!
People decide what people need!

14:52.708 --> 14:54.708
You can't stop them.
You'll shut your mouth.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.166
They'll eat if they want to eat.
Right, kids?

14:57.250 --> 14:58.833
Bravo!

15:05.125 --> 15:06.750
OK, guys. Come on.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.500
Here we go.

15:10.541 --> 15:12.833
Go in kids. Go, go, go. Go in.

15:12.875 --> 15:15.000
Everyone, in. Go, go.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.666
To the big table.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.583
Hello brother.

15:18.625 --> 15:19.958
Hello, welcome.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.958
-Do you have rice and beans?
-Sure, we do.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.458
It's delicious.

15:23.541 --> 15:26.583
But we have a requirement.
You need to have a membership card.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.083
-Membership card?
-Yes, sir.

15:29.125 --> 15:32.000
Look at that, looks like
you've caught up with modern technology.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.875
-It's been a year.
-Here, read it.

15:37.875 --> 15:38.875
What does it say?

15:38.916 --> 15:41.500
3169, Recep Ivedik.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.583
One and only. 69 is my favorite number.

15:44.666 --> 15:48.041
Look, this group is very important.
Don't embarrass me.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.250
Do we ever, Recep?
Your guests are our guests as well.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.666
Thank you.
Let me talk to the chef.

15:52.791 --> 15:55.958
-Hello, chef.
-Hello, brother. Welcome.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.500
Thank you. Do you have beans,
are they good?

15:57.583 --> 15:59.458
Like always, it's very good.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.041
Let me taste it.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.416
Yes.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.041
I should taste it before the kids.

16:06.583 --> 16:07.791
Hold on.

16:10.125 --> 16:13.125
No. This is definitely not
what I'm looking for.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.875
It's gotten worse
since they started branching out.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.500
It has very little oil in it.

16:17.583 --> 16:20.291
And it's not even spicy.
I have had it before, I remember.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.958
We put less oil and spices now...

16:22.041 --> 16:23.708
...because of complaints.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.708
OK, good for you, but...

16:25.750 --> 16:27.833
...we are missing the taste
we've gotten used to.

16:27.916 --> 16:30.083
Put more spice in it.
Don't be afraid.

16:30.125 --> 16:33.041
Pour it in. Dude, pour it all in.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.625
Like this. Done.

16:34.708 --> 16:37.166
Put some more oil. Come on.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.125
Not like that. Don't be afraid.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.791
-Pour it.
-But that's too much.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.541
It's not much. I know it.

16:42.625 --> 16:45.250
Stir it. Stir it. Mix it up.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.750
Hold on.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.208
No, it's still not
what I'm looking for. Definitely.

16:52.250 --> 16:55.541
This is nothing like the one
I had 4-5 years ago...

16:55.583 --> 16:57.958
...on the way to Antalya.
Super Mario's recipe.

16:58.041 --> 17:01.041
Are you talking about
the original Super Mario recipe?

17:01.083 --> 17:03.125
Of course, I am.
What else did you think?

17:03.166 --> 17:05.915
-But he added engine oil.
-That's what I'm talking about!

17:05.958 --> 17:08.250
Engine oil, certainly.
Two servings for four pounds.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.250
-Bring it here. Do you have any engine oil?
-We do.

17:10.415 --> 17:11.833
Bring it here.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.583
Let's pour it all in.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.500
Beans should have engine oil
in a truck driver's pit stop.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.083
Stir it up now. Just like that.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.083
Let it take it all in.

17:26.165 --> 17:28.833
Let it absorb. Like that.
All the way.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.083
Keep going. Let it absorb it all.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.375
Stir it up, man. Do it.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.416
Keep going. Like that.

17:35.458 --> 17:36.958
OK. Let me taste it.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.208
OK, that's it.
This is the taste I'm looking for.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.083
Very good. Give me a plate.

17:43.125 --> 17:44.750
Oh my God!

17:44.791 --> 17:46.291
God, these beans!

17:46.333 --> 17:48.125
This is the best beans I've ever had, kids.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.458
I tasted it myself. Let's give some
to the henchman of the leader...

17:51.500 --> 17:53.916
...so there is no doubt. Here.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.916
Here you go. Eat it!

17:58.250 --> 17:59.458
How is it?

18:00.666 --> 18:01.708
Do you like it?

18:01.750 --> 18:03.458
Well, it's good. Alright.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.833
-If he says it's good...
-Well then. Go on.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.208
Your leader has approved it, kids.

18:08.666 --> 18:10.250
Yes, bring it here.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.375
Leader, have some.
To the girls, as well. Yes.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.916
-Here.
-I don't eat meat. I'm vegetarian.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.125
-There is no meat in it.
-What are these pieces then?

18:20.208 --> 18:21.791
That's lamb.

18:21.916 --> 18:24.458
I don't eat meat.
Get this out of my sight.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.000
Here, dear. You eat it.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.625
What would you like then?
How about cold cuts?

18:28.666 --> 18:31.291
I don't eat meat.
Don't you get it?

18:31.333 --> 18:33.125
-It's cold cuts, not meat.
-What?

18:33.166 --> 18:35.416
-It's an internal organ.
-I don't eat any part of an animal.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.750
Good for you!
As if the animal cares!

18:37.833 --> 18:39.916
OK, dear. Have some.

18:39.958 --> 18:42.166
-I won't eat it.
-Why not?

18:42.208 --> 18:44.458
How could I? It stinks.
It also makes me bloated.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.958
I can't eat it.
I'm an athlete.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.458
Bloated or not, so what?
Do athletes not fart?

18:48.625 --> 18:51.791
Move to the back seats and fart there.
You already do it.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.541
Come on, girls. Don't lie to me.
I see it all.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.625
-I want avocado.
-Avocado?

18:56.666 --> 18:58.541
-Yes, avocado.
-Where are you from?

18:58.583 --> 19:01.625
-I'm from Ankara.
-Did you grow up eating avocados in Ankara?

19:01.708 --> 19:04.125
As if Keçiören and Yenimahalle
are full of avocado fields.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.250
I want oatmeal.
I don't want to eat this.

19:06.291 --> 19:09.958
Oat is not human food.
It's horse food. Horses eat it.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.458
I know. I'm a runner, too.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.458
Do you also want sugar cubes
and carrots?

19:13.541 --> 19:15.250
-Would you have some?
-What a jerk.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.708
OK, whatever.
Conductor, you eat it.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.083
-Conductor?
-National railways. Come on.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.250
National railways? Just because
I have braces, you can't call me that.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.750
-Are you eating it or not?
-I am not.

19:24.791 --> 19:25.875
Whatever.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.333
I count my calories.
I would put on weight if I eat it.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.208
Count them yourself.
A spoonful equals three grams.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.916
-I can't eat it.
-Why not?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.541
You might as well eat it
but I'm an athlete.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.041
What do you think I am?
A piece of trash?

19:37.125 --> 19:38.125
Garbage?

19:38.166 --> 19:39.666
Excuse me but I'm a European gold medalist.

19:39.708 --> 19:42.333
And I'm Güngören sudoku gold medalist.
So what? Eat it!

19:42.416 --> 19:43.750
-I won't.
-Take the plates away.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.500
-Please.
-Take them all away.

19:45.708 --> 19:48.583
Look at their attitudes,
crossing their arms and everything.

19:48.666 --> 19:51.500
-Wait in the bus if you please.
-It would be better actually.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.416
-Don't eat it then!
-We won't anyway.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.833
Give them to the those champions.

19:57.916 --> 20:00.416
See, they are already eating!
Go on, eat!

20:00.708 --> 20:03.583
Devour the beans
then devour your opponents!

20:03.666 --> 20:06.208
-Eat!
-Hooray!

20:08.416 --> 20:10.500
Go on, dear. Quickly.
Let's go.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.708
Go on! Hurry up!

20:12.833 --> 20:15.333
Yes, go on.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.083
The bus looks too plain.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.250
It bothers me.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.791
Give that to me. Hand it over.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.291
Nurullah, wait a minute.
I'll do something.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.875
Alright.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.083
Alright. It looks perfect.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.375
Let me see.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.166
It's awesome!

20:52.416 --> 20:54.416
It's just perfect for Turkey.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.000
Nurullah, go on.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.791
Keep going.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.125
-It hurts. How about you?
-Mine, too.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.625
Dude, it's so bad.

21:27.916 --> 21:29.375
It's the worst.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.750
Akif, we're not feeling well.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.458
Mert? Yusuf? Ege?
Are you guys alright?

21:39.791 --> 21:41.750
-Sir? Sir?
-What? What is it?

21:41.791 --> 21:43.583
-Are we there yet?
-Soon, sir. But...

21:43.625 --> 21:47.250
...some of the kids are not well.
They have stomach pain, nausea and sweating.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.958
I told you, Akif!

21:51.083 --> 21:53.666
-You made them eat the filthy food...
-I had some, too, sir.

21:53.708 --> 21:56.250
So what? Are you going to compete, idiot?

21:56.291 --> 21:59.416
Guys, what's going on there?
I hear noises. What's up?

21:59.458 --> 22:01.333
Everything! The kids are in too much pain.

22:01.375 --> 22:04.125
-Why?
-You made them eat the filthy food. See?

22:04.166 --> 22:06.916
It doesn't have anything to do with the food.
Don't blame the food.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.166
It was yummy.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.625
Their metabolism is not the same as you pigs!

22:10.708 --> 22:12.833
Your stomach is full of trash already!

22:12.875 --> 22:14.791
Button it! Button it!

22:15.000 --> 22:16.916
How long until we get there?

22:16.958 --> 22:18.291
Calm down, sir.
We're almost there.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.625
Step on it! Hurry up!
These kids immediate medical care.

22:20.666 --> 22:23.000
We need to take them to the Olympic Hospital.
I'm going nuts!

22:23.041 --> 22:26.083
Don't mess with the driver.
Sit back in your seat.

22:35.625 --> 22:38.750
Let me tell you something.
It's because of the air conditioning.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.708
-You say so?
-Definitely.

22:40.791 --> 22:43.208
You'll see.
The doctor will say the same thing.

22:43.291 --> 22:44.625
It's the air conditioning.

22:44.666 --> 22:47.000
If it were food poisoning,
we would throw up and such.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.625
It would affect us, too.
Do you feel anything?

22:48.708 --> 22:50.541
-Not really.
-Me, neither.

22:50.625 --> 22:52.166
It's the air conditioning.

22:52.250 --> 22:54.375
What the hell are you talking about?
You idiots!

22:54.458 --> 22:56.708
Shame on you!
You animals!

22:56.750 --> 22:58.208
Watch your mouth!

22:58.250 --> 23:01.791
If any one of these kids can't compete...

23:01.833 --> 23:04.791
...I will make sure you two
never step foot in to the country.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.666
What have I done, sir? Tell me.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.208
I was just driving the bus.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.708
Dude, you're such a butt kisser!

23:10.791 --> 23:13.250
-You sold me out right away.
-Am I wrong? You said it yourself.

23:13.291 --> 23:16.208
-You talked about Kakader.
-You make me sick!

23:16.291 --> 23:18.958
I can't believe it.
You literally sold me out.

23:19.125 --> 23:22.000
-Are you the Turkish group?
-Yes, I'm the group leader.

23:22.041 --> 23:24.416
-What's he situation?
-The kids are not doing well.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.708
They are in shock
because of the poisoning.

23:29.708 --> 23:33.625
It's because of the air conditioning,
right Doc?

23:33.666 --> 23:35.000
That kind of poisoning?

23:35.125 --> 23:37.000
-No, it's not.
-How come?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.250
How come, Doc?

23:38.291 --> 23:41.166
My grandma would get out of the shower
and lay under the air conditioning.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.416
Then she would throw out from both ends.

23:43.458 --> 23:45.000
It's the air conditioning.

23:45.041 --> 23:47.541
It might be because of that, too.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.833
But it's not the air conditioning.

23:49.916 --> 23:53.541
We have found toxic residues
inside their stomachs...

23:53.916 --> 23:55.916
...because of something they ate.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.333
So what is going to happen now?

23:59.375 --> 24:01.583
The better ones will rest for four days...

24:01.666 --> 24:04.125
...and the others for seven days.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.791
Unfortunately, they can't compete.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.750
Sir! Sir!

24:11.625 --> 24:14.500
Doc, what are you saying?
How come they can't compete?

24:14.541 --> 24:16.666
Get them on their feet. Please.
They are blaming me.

24:16.708 --> 24:19.208
We've come all this way.
Now they're out to get me.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.416
The blame will be on me.
Please, get them on their feet.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.000
Sir, unfortunately
there's nothing I can do.

24:24.083 --> 24:27.083
The only remedy is to rest.

24:27.125 --> 24:29.500
What do you mean you can't do anything?

24:29.541 --> 24:31.833
Get them on their feet.

24:31.875 --> 24:35.416
I'll kiss your toes and
mumble your pinkies.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.291
I will clean your belly button
with my tongue.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.666
Please! Get these kids on their feet.

24:40.708 --> 24:44.125
Inject something, give them IV.
Do an MRI scan. Anything!

24:44.166 --> 24:47.916
I have a saying: "Rest, rest, rest."

24:48.000 --> 24:50.125
To rest is the best remedy.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.875
"Rest, rest, rest."

24:53.916 --> 24:57.125
If they're going to heal by themselves
what are you here for?

24:57.208 --> 25:00.166
Why the hell they made you a professor?
You don't have any hair left.

25:00.208 --> 25:03.291
Like Asimo,
walking around like a humanoid robot.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.000
"Rest, rest." Idiot.

25:06.291 --> 25:08.583
Entrust me to the Turkish doctors.

25:08.625 --> 25:09.875
Jerk.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.625
You're done for! Done for!

25:13.666 --> 25:16.083
You're done for, damn it!
What sort of an abomination are you?

25:16.125 --> 25:18.625
-God damn you!
-Why, what did I do?

25:18.666 --> 25:21.375
What else are you going to do?
You ruined Turkey's reputation.

25:21.416 --> 25:23.208
-We did?
-Yes, you did! For real?

25:23.291 --> 25:25.541
-What did we do?
-The whole team is sick.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.958
The whole team! God damn you!

25:28.041 --> 25:29.833
You animals!
How am I stuck with you?

25:29.875 --> 25:32.458
You're stuck on me like a dung on a wall.
Just leave!

25:32.541 --> 25:35.500
These kids had dreams, hopes.

25:35.541 --> 25:38.458
You destroyed their dreams one by one.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.916
God damn you.

25:39.958 --> 25:42.875
Dream killer, hope reaper,
future destroyer!

25:42.958 --> 25:45.125
Look, that's too much.
Watch your mouth.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.041
There's even more, you moron!

25:47.125 --> 25:49.333
I know what I am going to do.

25:49.583 --> 25:50.958
What are you doing?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.708
Now I'm calling the undersecretary, alright?

25:53.750 --> 25:56.000
Then I'll pronounce you both traitors.

25:56.041 --> 25:59.125
I'll revoke your citizenships.
I'll even send you to Mars if I have to.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.875
And I'm withdrawing Turkey from the games.
"And the reason is this idiot." I'll say.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.208
You're being too harsh,
calling me an idiot.

26:05.291 --> 26:08.166
I assume it's because of your panic attack.
I'm not going to let anyone withdraw Turkey.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.375
-I will.
-You won't. Who do you think you are?

26:10.416 --> 26:11.916
I am the leader of this group.
Who are you?

26:11.958 --> 26:13.833
I am Recep Ivedik
and I won't let you.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.166
-I will.
-You won't.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.125
-I will.
-Nobody is withdrawing Turkey.

26:17.166 --> 26:20.333
-Especially in these lands.
-I am in charge here.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.500
-Who are you?
-Hang up.

26:21.541 --> 26:22.708
-I won't.
-Do it.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.750
You can't give me orders,
I am in charge.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.541
-This is the last warning, hang up.
-Stay out of it.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.416
-Drop the phone. Hang up.
-Get out of here.

26:28.458 --> 26:29.958
-Dude, hang up.
-I won't.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.541
I won't.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.458
Sir!

26:33.541 --> 26:36.250
He passed out.
Put him on a wheelchair.

26:36.541 --> 26:38.166
I am sorry.

26:38.291 --> 26:40.833
He's our little brother.
Our mum has left us.

26:40.875 --> 26:42.291
He has hereditary schizophrenia.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.000
We slap him when he goes mad.
We don't have any money.

26:47.708 --> 26:49.250
This way.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.416
Okay. Tape there, as well.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.875
-Is it tight?
-Yes.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.500
Okay, here.

26:57.666 --> 26:59.291
That was some slap, he's still out.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.416
-You think he's OK?
-He's alright.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.708
He'll be just fine.
He's lucky I hit him.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.166
If he had hit him...

27:05.250 --> 27:07.791
No, Recep. How dare I
when you are here?

27:07.875 --> 27:09.625
Oh, come on.
Look at those arms.

27:09.708 --> 27:12.250
You see?
It's like a brick.

27:12.416 --> 27:14.291
I don't know if it's a human arm or not.

27:14.375 --> 27:15.541
It's obviously not.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.958
He would knock the lights out of someone.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.291
-He's coming to.
-Yes, he is.

27:20.541 --> 27:23.833
Akif... Akif, what's going on?
Where are we?

27:23.875 --> 27:26.500
-Who tied me up, Akif?
-We are in the hotel room, sir.

27:26.708 --> 27:27.916
Nurullah tied you up.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.166
I tied you because Recep told me to.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.666
Nurullah, you are such a coward.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.875
You tied him up because I said so, huh?

27:34.958 --> 27:36.750
So you are off the hook now?

27:36.833 --> 27:39.291
-But you did.
-I can't believe it.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.958
That's the second time.
I'll hurt you the next time.

27:42.041 --> 27:43.875
Akif, call the undersecretary immediately.

27:43.958 --> 27:46.791
Tell him everything.
We are withdrawing Turkey from the games.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.083
Don't call anyone.
You can't call anyone.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.375
No undersecretaries.

27:51.416 --> 27:54.875
I won't let anyone withdraw
Turkey from the games, period.

27:54.958 --> 27:57.041
-Is it clear?
-Crystal clear.

27:57.125 --> 27:59.541
If there's no one, we will compete.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.708
We screwed it up
and we're going to fix it, that's all!

28:01.791 --> 28:03.666
-We will?
-Yes, we will. Why?

28:03.875 --> 28:06.208
-Why are you surprised?
-How are you going to compete...

28:06.250 --> 28:08.375
...with your big bellies and fat asses?

28:08.458 --> 28:10.833
How? You don't even have a license.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.250
Let's say you do.
You aren't even registered.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.833
There's something called registration.
Do you know about it?

28:15.875 --> 28:17.625
Do you think this is a TV program?

28:17.666 --> 28:19.500
Sir, may I interrupt?

28:19.541 --> 28:21.791
With the new changes to the regulations...

28:21.833 --> 28:23.833
...it's possible to register a new athlete...

28:23.875 --> 28:26.208
-...by 10 o'clock on the first day.
-Listen to him.

28:26.250 --> 28:28.083
-So we can compete?
-Yes, we can.

28:28.125 --> 28:30.500
I'll kiss you now. Hear?

28:30.541 --> 28:33.166
So what if the registration is open?
So what?

28:33.250 --> 28:35.375
We can neither find a team...

28:35.416 --> 28:37.625
-...nor can we license them.
-Button it.

28:37.791 --> 28:40.625
I'm tired of hearing your voice.
Gag him.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.333
-Shut him up.
-Akif, do something.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.125
Akif, don't just stand the--

28:44.166 --> 28:47.083
That's it. I was fed up with his voice.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.208
Look...

28:48.250 --> 28:50.833
...I am the leader of this group
from now on.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.791
-OK.
-And I appoint you as my assistant.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.875
-Thank you, sir.
-You go, Recep!

28:55.916 --> 28:58.291
What, Nurullah?
What's up with you?

28:58.375 --> 29:00.000
"You go, Recep!" and everything?

29:00.083 --> 29:02.083
You just sold me out
two minutes ago, you fatty!

29:02.125 --> 29:04.666
Dude, you're such a power hungry kiss ass.

29:04.750 --> 29:06.083
At least don't do it blatantly.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.291
Now that I have the power,
you are kissing mine.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.583
Come on, Recep.
I'm always on your side.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.083
Button it.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.166
Akif, how many people do we need?

29:14.208 --> 29:17.083
We used to have 14 male athletes.

29:17.125 --> 29:19.333
-They're all beat.
-14 males.

29:19.791 --> 29:22.333
Then we can cover it up
with five, six proper men.

29:22.375 --> 29:23.958
How are you going to find them?

29:24.041 --> 29:25.958
I have something in mind.
Follow me.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.458
You stay with him.
I won't hear a word from him, OK?

29:28.541 --> 29:30.375
-OK.
-You accompany him.

29:30.416 --> 29:32.000
I'll blame you if anything happens.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.750
Alright.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.541
What's this?

29:37.625 --> 29:41.208
Kakader.
Karaambar Truck Drivers Union 2016 calendar.

29:41.291 --> 29:42.416
Open the index.

29:42.458 --> 29:45.208
I'll call them one by one
and they'll all gather here.

29:45.333 --> 29:46.958
Start from A. Who's at A?

29:47.041 --> 29:49.375
-Adem.
-Adem, Adem the Brick.

29:49.458 --> 29:52.000
He's the best in all sports
that requires strength.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.958
Hello? I'll say what, Adem.
Where are you?

29:55.125 --> 29:58.125
Konya? OK, do a U-turn from there...

29:58.166 --> 30:00.958
...then come to Macedonia.
The emergency code?

30:01.166 --> 30:03.083
You ask for the emergency code?

30:03.166 --> 30:04.500
Alright, sure.

30:05.291 --> 30:07.708
The harder I smack,
the easier you crack.

30:07.791 --> 30:09.750
Get it? You have the code now.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.833
You have no choice,
you have to come.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.666
Write him down, he's coming.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.416
-Who's next?
-Adnan.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
Jean Claude Adnan.
We can use him.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.541
Hello? Adnan?

30:19.666 --> 30:21.458
I hope you feel better.
I've heard something.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.916
I heard that you stayed
in Çorum State Hospital for a few days.

30:23.958 --> 30:26.208
How is it even possible to injure a coccyx?

30:26.291 --> 30:30.166
Adnan, why would you even try to split
your legs between two semis on the highway?

30:30.208 --> 30:32.250
Are you an idiot?
Anyway, tell you what.

30:32.291 --> 30:34.125
Come to Skopje, Macedonia.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.708
Can you? He stayed
in the vegetative state for five months.

30:36.750 --> 30:39.083
He still comes to Macedonia.
That's how manly he is.

30:39.291 --> 30:40.916
-Who's next?
-Erdal.

30:40.958 --> 30:42.875
Erdal. Erdal the Aquatic.

30:42.916 --> 30:45.708
When he was six, we would jump
in the dam lake.

30:45.916 --> 30:47.458
He jumped first.
He got stuck in the turbine.

30:47.583 --> 30:49.375
The turbine slashed his head.

30:49.416 --> 30:51.875
He's been bald since he was six.
He got his brain smashed a little, too.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.541
He's a little retarded.

30:54.708 --> 30:56.125
Erdal, how are you?

30:56.208 --> 30:59.500
It's Recep Ivedik.
There is a job involving swimming and diving.

30:59.541 --> 31:02.000
It's perfect for you.
Come on. Yes, I'm in Macedonia.

31:02.041 --> 31:04.333
Yes, Skopje, Macedonia.
You're the man.

31:04.416 --> 31:05.708
Write it down, Erdal is coming.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.791
When we were kids, I told him:
"Instead of jumping in a dam lake...

31:07.833 --> 31:10.166
...go jump into that pool."
The pool was empty, you know.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.791
He dove into a ten feet deep empty pool.

31:12.875 --> 31:16.083
He crashed into the bottom of the pool.
His head cracked open.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.625
There were tile pieces
coming out of his head.

31:18.666 --> 31:20.666
Deep into his skull.
They couldn't remove them.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.375
He lived like that for a few years.

31:22.541 --> 31:25.125
That's right.
The tile pieces were dripping from his ears.

31:25.166 --> 31:27.666
Each time he shook his head...

31:27.791 --> 31:29.750
-He is still alive despite everything.
-Right.

31:29.833 --> 31:32.416
Life goes on.
Who's next?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.250
-Hasan.
-Hasan. OK.

31:34.291 --> 31:35.625
Hasan the Runner.

31:35.666 --> 31:38.250
His dad would feed him hot peppers.

31:38.333 --> 31:41.041
He would throw a kick
and Hasan would run from Samsun to Zonguldak.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.250
He would run for two days.
You know the movie...

31:43.291 --> 31:44.708
-...Forrest Bond.
-Forrest Gump.

31:44.791 --> 31:46.750
Yes, Forrest Bond.
It's based on his life.

31:46.833 --> 31:48.708
Americans came and shot it here.

31:48.750 --> 31:51.375
Hasan, how is it going?
Thank you. I'm doing well, too.

31:51.416 --> 31:54.125
Where are you?
Transporting goods from Samsun to Kayseri?

31:54.208 --> 31:57.541
Unload the truck,
turn around and come to Macedonia.

31:57.625 --> 31:58.583
Come to Macedonia.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.625
Take the truck.
I will have you run here.

32:00.708 --> 32:02.333
Thank you very much.

32:02.416 --> 32:05.375
It's the perfect team.
I created the perfect team.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.541
Are there games with jumping involved?

32:07.583 --> 32:09.666
There is high jump and long jump.

32:09.875 --> 32:10.958
Orhan the Jumpy.

32:11.041 --> 32:12.791
Hey, how are you?

32:12.875 --> 32:14.208
Thank you.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.958
I need you here.
Let me give you the code.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.250
The harder I smack,
the easier you crack.

32:19.458 --> 32:21.041
No way! Why on earth would I swear?

32:21.083 --> 32:22.416
It's the emergency code.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.500
I'll report you and they will kick you out.

32:24.583 --> 32:27.416
Turn back and come to Macedonia.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.708
Orhan, before we hang up...

32:29.750 --> 32:32.291
You brain must have broken free,
You go and sit on a fallen tree.

32:32.375 --> 32:33.666
No, it is not a code.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.916
I just felt like saying it.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.041
OK, just hang up.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.791
You can't keep up with me.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.833
Don't assume you can rap,
you can't battle with Recep.

32:43.875 --> 32:46.291
Look at the window, up to the sky;
stop talking or your ass I will fry.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.416
OK, just hang up. Alright.

32:49.708 --> 32:51.291
How many do we have?

32:51.500 --> 32:52.500
Five.

32:52.541 --> 32:54.791
That's enough.
There is also me so we're six.

32:54.958 --> 32:57.833
Now we'll take of their licenses...

32:57.875 --> 32:59.916
...and have them registered in the morning.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.625
Come along.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.833
There's no one coming.
Where are they?

33:16.875 --> 33:19.458
It is 9:15. Don't we have time until 10:00?

33:19.541 --> 33:22.083
-Yes. We don't have much time left.
-Look, there they are.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.541
Look at them! Here!

33:27.666 --> 33:30.208
Come on! That's Karaambar for you!

33:32.000 --> 33:34.791
Easy! Slow down!

33:41.750 --> 33:44.541
-Welcome guys.
-Thank you.

33:44.625 --> 33:46.500
What's up, Recep?
You called us in here urgently.

33:46.541 --> 33:47.708
I hope everything is OK.

33:47.750 --> 33:50.791
Guys, I called you in here
for a very important cause.

33:50.833 --> 33:53.958
But let us not talk about it in public.
Walls have ears.

33:54.583 --> 33:57.458
I will host you somewhere private.
Follow me.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.291
Now you'll ask me
why I called you guys in here, right?

34:02.375 --> 34:04.416
You called us and we are here, Recep.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.541
Just show us whose ass we'll kick.

34:06.625 --> 34:08.291
There is no ass kicking.

34:08.375 --> 34:11.541
We are here to represent
Republic of Turkey for a week.

34:11.625 --> 34:14.083
A week? Can you explain further?

34:14.125 --> 34:18.041
Sure. Now, in this sports complex...

34:18.291 --> 34:21.958
...Eurasia Athletic Games will take place.

34:22.041 --> 34:25.583
In short, four youngsters
from two continents crashing on.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.791
What does this mean?

34:27.833 --> 34:32.583
The youngsters will represent their countries
by competing in athletic games.

34:32.625 --> 34:35.458
Before the Turkish group arrived here...

34:35.625 --> 34:37.708
...they insisted on eating some beans.

34:37.791 --> 34:41.416
They got poisoned.
They all threw up from both ends.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.333
They're in the hospital now.

34:43.541 --> 34:45.458
So we no longer have a team.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.166
And there was this stupid leader.

34:47.208 --> 34:50.041
He said he would withdraw the team
but I said "No way!

34:50.125 --> 34:53.000
I know Karaambar Truck Drivers Union.

34:53.083 --> 34:58.208
There are brave, young men
who love their flag and their country.

34:58.291 --> 35:01.333
We'll call them over, they will represent us.
There is no way we're withdrawing!"

35:01.375 --> 35:02.875
I don't know. Was I wrong?

35:02.958 --> 35:05.875
If the motherland is involved,
nothing else matters.

35:06.041 --> 35:09.458
We won't leave you
hanging in these lands where...

35:09.541 --> 35:11.916
...our ancestors had ruled
for 600 years, Recep.

35:12.083 --> 35:14.583
Don't worry, Recep.
The entire Karaambar is here.

35:14.625 --> 35:17.458
-We're here for you.
-Yes, we are.

35:17.833 --> 35:20.041
Now we represent Turkey.
We're a team!

35:44.708 --> 35:46.125
Hello.

35:46.166 --> 35:47.750
We would like to register new athletes.

35:47.791 --> 35:49.625
-New athletes?
-Yes, new athletes.

35:49.666 --> 35:51.291
Give him the licenses.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.750
Unfortunately, sir.
The last registration date was yesterday.

35:54.833 --> 35:56.125
The deadline has passed.
I can't help you.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.416
What do you mean?
We are here on time.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.041
-What is he saying, Akif?
-He is wrong.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.416
Excuse me but you're wrong.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.750
Can you please
go to the page 23 in the rulebook?

36:03.916 --> 36:05.625
Item 1-G, please.

36:05.708 --> 36:09.291
The registrations are open
until 10:00 on the opening day, right?

36:09.333 --> 36:10.708
Now that's interesting.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.083
It might be a new regulation...

36:12.125 --> 36:13.875
...but I still can't help you...

36:13.916 --> 36:15.791
...because it is 10:02.

36:15.875 --> 36:17.875
Don't make me beat you up!

36:17.958 --> 36:20.416
Please, calm down.
Let me talk to him.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.541
Sir, listen. Our male athletes are done for.

36:23.625 --> 36:25.708
We are late due to some medical issues.

36:25.791 --> 36:27.750
We tried to be here by 10:00,
as early as possible.

36:27.833 --> 36:30.708
Can you please register us?
Sports is tolerance after all.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.916
I can't turn down such a nice attitude.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.125
-I will register you.
-OK, go on.

36:35.208 --> 36:36.500
Cut it short.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.500
-Recep Ivedik?
-Yes, Recep Ivedik.

36:38.625 --> 36:40.083
You didn't fill in the branch part.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.750
No, I didn't because I'm a multi entrant.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.083
-Multi?
-Yes. What are you going to do now?

36:44.208 --> 36:46.083
Sure, multi. I will participate as I please.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.416
Any branch I want.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.875
I'll do them all.
It is my philosophy.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.708
-That's how I live my life.
-Alright, sir. However you wish.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.958
-Come on.
-Age is 19?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.875
Yes, I am 19.
I was registered late.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.166
There was an older sibling.

36:59.208 --> 37:02.791
I was given his ID
when he passed away. That's how.

37:03.125 --> 37:05.750
-Age is 18.
-Yes, he is 18.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.791
-And he's 16?
-Yes, 16. Come here.

37:10.250 --> 37:11.333
He was a bright boy.

37:11.416 --> 37:13.375
He hit puberty in summer holiday
and came back like this.

37:13.458 --> 37:15.083
He had no hair but now look at him.

37:15.125 --> 37:17.583
He had a sweet voice.

37:17.625 --> 37:19.708
-Listen to him. Speak up.
-Hello.

37:19.750 --> 37:22.250
You would tell him to shut up.
That's how awful he sounds.

37:22.291 --> 37:24.041
Your ages seem not very convincing to me.

37:24.083 --> 37:26.000
Are we supposed to prove our ages to you?

37:26.041 --> 37:27.708
The licenses given by the state
are in front of you.

37:27.791 --> 37:30.250
We are here on time, too.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.875
You have to approve it.
Why are you dancing around?

37:32.958 --> 37:35.791
Why? I think what you're doing is intentional.

37:35.875 --> 37:38.708
Whenever Turkey comes to Europe,
something happens.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.458
We are familiar with it
from the football games.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.791
Racism happens each time
Turkey comes to Europe.

37:42.875 --> 37:45.875
Are you discriminating against us?
Are you?

37:45.958 --> 37:47.791
You discriminating,
racist jerk!

37:47.875 --> 37:50.750
Recep, please.
Come to your senses.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.208
Let me talk to him.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.083
Sir, look, things like this happen.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.583
For example, you look 50 at most.

37:56.625 --> 37:59.291
Thank you very much.
I've turned 67 this year.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.833
-You are very polite.
-I am?

38:02.166 --> 38:04.583
I am approving your registration
thanks to this gentleman.

38:04.625 --> 38:07.333
Welcome to Eurasia 2016.

38:07.375 --> 38:08.458
Thank you.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.333
I hope everything goes well.

38:12.208 --> 38:15.458
I think things will go well for us but
I can't say the same thing about you.

38:15.541 --> 38:18.416
-How come?
-He's obviously hitting on you.

38:18.541 --> 38:21.708
If he catches you alone,
he might do all sorts of things. Be careful.

38:21.750 --> 38:23.166
-Come on!
-Just be careful.

38:23.208 --> 38:25.708
Come on, guys.
Let's cheer for Turkey for everyone to hear.

38:25.750 --> 38:26.833
Come on.

38:26.875 --> 38:29.916
Turkey!

38:30.000 --> 38:31.083
That's it!

38:31.166 --> 38:32.791
-Alright!
-Turkey!

38:36.875 --> 38:40.458
OK guys, as your new leader...

38:40.500 --> 38:43.958
...I would like to
welcome you to the Eurasia Youth Games.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.500
Excuse me? Where is our leader?
What happened to him?

38:46.541 --> 38:49.041
He is no longer your leader, dear.
I'm your new leader.

38:49.083 --> 38:50.125
As it says right here.

38:50.166 --> 38:52.000
I'm responsible for the team from now on.

38:52.041 --> 38:55.208
What team are you talking about
with all the male athletes in the hospital?

38:55.291 --> 38:58.416
-It will be a disaster.
-That's right.

39:02.041 --> 39:04.375
What are these noises
like a flock of turkeys?

39:04.458 --> 39:06.375
Keep silent. Girls.

39:06.666 --> 39:08.833
I am also aware that
the male athletes are missing.

39:08.875 --> 39:10.666
So I came up with a solution real quick.

39:10.708 --> 39:12.083
I have brought new guys.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.708
-These are the male athletes.
-Who are these people?

39:14.750 --> 39:17.333
Excuse me but have you brought them?
Look at them.

39:17.375 --> 39:20.000
Did you ask them
if they even have history in sports?

39:20.041 --> 39:22.666
We are done with the past.
We are looking ahead.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.875
-Have you heard him?
-There is no way!

39:24.916 --> 39:26.958
Are we going to represent Turkey with them?

39:27.041 --> 39:30.500
Look at them.
They're animals! They look like truck drivers.

39:30.583 --> 39:33.583
We sure are truck drivers, little miss.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.125
I can't believe it!
He is saying he is a truck driver!

39:38.625 --> 39:40.291
What's wrong with the way we look?

39:40.333 --> 39:42.166
Aren't we Turkish
because we drive trucks?

39:42.208 --> 39:44.416
When you all were little babies...

39:44.458 --> 39:46.583
...we would do push ups
at the edge of a cliff.

39:46.666 --> 39:48.958
Also, we will represent Turkey
in the best way.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.208
Mind your own business.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.083
-I don't want to.
-Send us back home.

39:52.125 --> 39:55.375
Alright, enough! Blah blah blah...

39:55.416 --> 39:56.791
Bunch of blabbermouths.

39:56.833 --> 39:59.250
Are you athletes or bunch of gossipers?

39:59.291 --> 40:02.083
If it were up to your old leader,
he would withdraw from the games.

40:02.458 --> 40:05.250
Would it be better if we ran away?
How would it make us look?

40:05.416 --> 40:08.125
Huh? I'm calling the shots from now on.

40:08.166 --> 40:10.541
If you don't like it, you had better leave.
Understood?

40:10.583 --> 40:12.458
-Alright.
-Understood.

40:14.500 --> 40:15.750
Understood or not?

40:15.791 --> 40:17.208
-Understood.
-OK.

40:17.250 --> 40:21.208
Now I'm leaving the floor
to my new assistant, Akif.

40:23.291 --> 40:24.333
Alright, guys.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.541
I welcome you all.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.166
I'm proud to be a part of you and this--

40:28.208 --> 40:30.208
Come on! Cut the crap!

40:30.250 --> 40:32.375
-Stop kissing ass. Tell them.
-Alright.

40:34.000 --> 40:34.875
Guys...

40:34.916 --> 40:38.416
...tough competition awaits
our national team like Greece...

40:38.458 --> 40:40.875
...Bulgaria, Russia, Romania...

40:40.958 --> 40:43.583
...and Ukraine in this tournament.

40:43.666 --> 40:45.375
Cut to the chase. Be efficient.

40:45.458 --> 40:47.125
How many medals do we need to get?

40:47.166 --> 40:48.750
Let me tell you this, in the first stage...

40:48.791 --> 40:51.291
...we need to win at least 15 gold medals...

40:51.333 --> 40:53.125
...to qualify for the finals.

40:53.166 --> 40:55.125
Hopefully we'll get 15.
God willing.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.875
-I'm sure you will.
-I hope so.

40:56.916 --> 40:58.958
-Let's go grab something to eat.
-Wait, don't go.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.750
There will be Cultural Bonding
feast in two hours.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.791
What is this Cultural Bonding feast thing?

41:02.833 --> 41:05.416
Each team prepares a traditional dish...

41:05.500 --> 41:07.166
...and put up on a little show.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.666
To relax and socialize
before the tournament begins.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.958
-What have we prepared?
-We have prepared nothing.

41:14.875 --> 41:15.958
You little...

41:16.041 --> 41:18.625
You're telling me this now?

41:18.708 --> 41:21.875
What do you mean "nothing"?
What do you mean "we haven't prepared"?

41:22.583 --> 41:24.708
-Alright. Erdal, Hasan!
-Yes?

41:24.791 --> 41:26.708
-Listening.
-You're responsible for the dance.

41:26.750 --> 41:29.875
Something traditional.
Throw some belly dancing in there.

41:29.958 --> 41:32.000
Do the whole choreography.
Do you have some nice music?

41:32.083 --> 41:34.875
We do.
I have Ankara Compilation 2016 in my truck.

41:34.916 --> 41:36.791
-Is it electronic mix?
-Yes, mixed.

41:36.833 --> 41:39.000
-Something from our culture.
-Very nice.

41:39.083 --> 41:41.416
Girls. You're responsible for the food.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.833
-What do you mean by food?
-You know, Turkish food...

41:43.916 --> 41:46.250
-...something good.
-I can't cook anything.

41:46.291 --> 41:48.916
-At least something with olive oil.
-I can't even make an omelette.

41:48.958 --> 41:52.208
-Not even the pastries?
-I can prepare toast, does it count?

41:52.250 --> 41:54.083
Do you call yourselves Turkish girls?

41:54.291 --> 41:56.291
Proper Turkish girls know how to cook!

41:56.333 --> 41:58.625
What if you were married?
Your husband would come home hungry.

41:58.666 --> 42:01.625
What would you say?
"Let me get you some takeaway food". Huh?

42:01.708 --> 42:03.833
What would you say? Idiot!

42:03.916 --> 42:06.041
As if everything is about sports.

42:06.166 --> 42:07.833
I will take care of the food, too.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.583
-Find me a lamb.
-A lamb?

42:09.666 --> 42:11.291
Yes, lamb. The usual kind.

42:11.375 --> 42:14.250
-Where am I supposed to find it?
-That's your business.

42:14.291 --> 42:15.666
Assistants don't talk back.

42:15.708 --> 42:21.000
Welcome to Eurasia Cultural Bonding Night!

42:23.625 --> 42:25.875
Our first country, Turkey!

42:26.791 --> 42:28.208
This way.

42:28.666 --> 42:30.125
Hello.

42:30.708 --> 42:33.166
Greetings to everyone.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.375
I salute you all.

42:35.458 --> 42:38.041
I see all sorts of different countries.

42:38.125 --> 42:40.416
There are nine different nations,
including us.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.958
I'd like to give you
a very important message.

42:43.041 --> 42:47.291
On behalf of Turkey,
I say none of you stand a chance in the games!

42:47.416 --> 42:49.791
God willing, we will whoop your asses!

42:50.666 --> 42:52.875
-But...
-What? What?

42:53.166 --> 42:54.958
Sir, please. No taunting.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.375
Sports is for friendship.
Let's not act this way.

42:57.416 --> 42:59.916
Sir, I'm not taunting anyone.
I'm just speaking my mind.

42:59.958 --> 43:01.291
Is there no freedom of speech here?

43:01.333 --> 43:04.541
Alright. Let's see
what you've brought from your country.

43:04.583 --> 43:08.000
First of all, we don't like to
waste as a nation.

43:08.041 --> 43:09.500
We don't like it at all.

43:09.541 --> 43:13.583
When we get our hands on an animal,
a lamb let's say, we use every part of it.

43:13.666 --> 43:17.208
We make use of every part of it, you see?
There is a whole lamb in here.

43:17.250 --> 43:20.791
Let me begin.
This is the head.

43:20.875 --> 43:22.750
Head of the lamb, you see?

43:22.833 --> 43:25.500
You take the knife and...

43:25.583 --> 43:27.416
...cut its head open as it shakes. Look.

43:27.458 --> 43:28.666
Its head, you see?

43:28.708 --> 43:30.791
And also, its cheeks are full of meat.

43:30.833 --> 43:32.375
Give it a kiss.

43:32.458 --> 43:35.083
Look, do you hear?
Its head is empty.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.208
-Why?
-Why?

43:36.250 --> 43:38.625
Lambs are smart.
Normally, it wouldn't be empty.

43:38.666 --> 43:39.875
Move, dear.

43:39.958 --> 43:42.208
Here. Do you see?

43:42.291 --> 43:43.750
-You eat that?
-Yes, we eat it.

43:43.833 --> 43:45.916
The brain of the animal.
Its baah center.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.500
Grass center, hopping center.

43:48.666 --> 43:50.666
Highland center.
Take a bite.

43:50.708 --> 43:52.458
-No, thank you.
-Have a bite.

43:52.541 --> 43:53.958
-I'm full.
-I insist.

43:54.041 --> 43:56.583
-Please, no.
-Alright. Move, dear.

43:56.666 --> 43:59.125
-And our favourite.
-What's that?

43:59.208 --> 44:00.500
-Kokoreç.
-Kokoreç?

44:00.541 --> 44:02.666
Yes, kokoreç.
What part of the lamb is this?

44:02.875 --> 44:04.875
-What part?
-Its intestines.

44:04.958 --> 44:07.666
Starts with the intestines, ends in colons.
The further end is the anus.

44:07.750 --> 44:11.000
That's where it ends.
All sorts of feces are stored there.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.833
When the animal dies,
you end up with miles of intestines.

44:13.875 --> 44:16.208
I take that and put it on a tap.
When you open the tap...

44:16.250 --> 44:19.000
...the water rushes down all the feces away.
You scrape it by hand like this.

44:19.083 --> 44:21.000
Then it is rolled. See here?

44:21.041 --> 44:22.875
Did you see? It's all rolled up. Look.

44:22.916 --> 44:25.375
It will cook nicely in its own fat.

44:25.458 --> 44:28.041
The fat is stored in it.
It's delicious. Have some.

44:28.125 --> 44:30.541
-Please...
-Come on, you've haven't had anything.

44:30.583 --> 44:32.625
Just a little bit.

44:32.833 --> 44:35.291
-How is it? Delicious, isn't it?
-I love it.

44:35.375 --> 44:37.500
I see you look a little different.

44:37.583 --> 44:39.666
-I'm going to be sick.
-Yes, sick. It's sick, isn't it?

44:39.750 --> 44:42.416
Eating this is so sick!
That's how amazing it is.

44:42.458 --> 44:44.166
Alright, if you'll excuse us...

44:44.250 --> 44:47.583
...we've prepared a little dance for you.

44:47.833 --> 44:50.458
Enter Asuk and Masuk!
And we'll leave the stage to them!

44:50.500 --> 44:53.208
Give it up for Asuk and Masuk! Turkey!

45:08.875 --> 45:11.333
Yes, give it up again
for the amazing Turkey...

45:11.458 --> 45:14.791
Such a great preparation
in such a short notice. Well done!

45:14.875 --> 45:17.375
Let me be clear,
I made wonders!

45:17.500 --> 45:20.375
Wonders? Is this the way
to represent Turkey?

45:20.416 --> 45:24.000
-Is this in our culture?
-What's in your culture, you skunk?

45:24.208 --> 45:26.458
Is duck with oranges in your culture,
young lady?

45:26.541 --> 45:30.541
Is Christmas turkey in your culture?
Or cheesecakes?

45:30.625 --> 45:33.250
Is fajitas in it or veal carpaccio?

45:33.333 --> 45:36.291
Or Halloween pumpkin?
What's in your culture?

45:36.416 --> 45:38.750
Lamb is in your culture.
Right, guys?

45:38.833 --> 45:42.000
-You're right.
-A country famous for its cuisine.

45:42.083 --> 45:45.250
Give it up for Greece!

45:45.416 --> 45:47.625
Let's see what these jerks have prepared.
I'm curious.

45:47.666 --> 45:49.958
Stop applauding, stop it!

45:50.750 --> 45:52.750
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.208
Yasuri friends!

45:54.250 --> 45:56.500
I'm Niko, from Greece.

45:56.541 --> 46:00.416
I'll introduce the best food
of the Greek cuisine.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.583
The very best of Greece.

46:02.625 --> 46:04.750
Our first food is moussaka.

46:04.833 --> 46:06.458
-What?
-It's made out of aubergine.

46:06.500 --> 46:09.041
Moussaka he says, aubergine he says.
That's our food.

46:09.166 --> 46:12.083
Our second food. Boreki!

46:12.125 --> 46:14.916
-What?
-Our third food, dolmadaki.

46:14.958 --> 46:16.875
Boreki, dolmaki. Come on!

46:16.958 --> 46:19.333
And our fourth food, caciki.

46:19.458 --> 46:21.208
That's it, come on!

46:21.250 --> 46:23.333
They've gone too far.

46:23.375 --> 46:26.083
I have to intervene.
Excuse me, but no.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.208
No way. Just a second.

46:28.291 --> 46:29.791
There is no such thing, move over.

46:29.875 --> 46:34.208
All the dishes he mentioned are Turkish.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.708
I'm telling you, they're all Turkish food.

46:36.791 --> 46:39.541
Look. Move aside.
This is musakka, made out of aubergine.

46:39.666 --> 46:42.916
Börek. And this is stuffed vine leaves.
And this is cacik.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.500
You dice cucumbers like this guy into it...

46:45.583 --> 46:48.583
...and add some peppermint in it.
That's cacik for you!

46:48.666 --> 46:51.375
-Don't be like that, they are guests.
-Sir, these are all...

46:51.458 --> 46:54.041
...originally from Greek cuisine.

46:54.083 --> 46:56.083
Greek cuisine my ass!

46:56.166 --> 46:58.166
Let me ask you a question.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.125
He hasn't said the name of that one yet.

47:00.166 --> 47:02.208
I'll tell you the name of that,
see if I'm right.

47:02.250 --> 47:05.583
-That's called baklava!
-No sir, it's not baklava.

47:05.708 --> 47:08.375
-It's baklavaki.
-And the last one is kadayif!

47:08.458 --> 47:10.958
No sir, not kadayif. It's kadayifi!

47:11.041 --> 47:13.291
-I'll slap this guy so hard...
-Please.

47:13.375 --> 47:15.541
...he'll see what kadayif is.
What's this nonsense?

47:15.625 --> 47:19.250
They spied on our tables
from the other shore...

47:19.333 --> 47:23.000
...and made whatever was on them.
Took this and that.

47:23.083 --> 47:26.291
Then they put "i" at the end
and there you have the Greek food.

47:26.333 --> 47:28.416
-Is this acceptable?
-No, there is no "taking this and that."

47:28.500 --> 47:30.666
These are all Greek food.
I bet on it!

47:30.708 --> 47:33.416
He bets on it!
Then I have a question for him.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.791
If you make everything Greek
by putting "i" in the end...

47:35.875 --> 47:39.375
...then why do you call yourself Greek?
Just say you're Turki! How about that?

47:39.458 --> 47:41.291
-None of that, please.
-Call yourself Turki!

47:41.375 --> 47:43.166
-No!
-He's insulting my identity.

47:43.250 --> 47:45.250
Yes, I insult his identity.
Why not Turki?

47:45.291 --> 47:46.916
I have to ask you to
go back to your seats, please.

47:46.958 --> 47:49.583
Wait a second! I've had enough!
We took this and that, huh?

47:49.625 --> 47:51.250
-Are these all Turkish food?
-Yes.

47:51.291 --> 47:52.791
-Turkish food?
-Yes.

47:52.833 --> 47:56.083
Then is sirtaki also a Turkish dance?
Yorgo.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.250
These are all Turkish.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.291
-Do not allow this.
-Please, stop.

48:00.333 --> 48:02.208
But these are all Turkish food.

48:02.250 --> 48:05.166
Let's see if it's Greek
or Turkish dance. Yorgo.

48:05.208 --> 48:08.125
Come on. He is introducing Turkish food.

48:11.416 --> 48:13.166
Look at the dance.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.208
That's not how it is.

48:27.541 --> 48:28.666
What's he doing?

48:28.833 --> 48:30.250
He is wasting them.

48:30.291 --> 48:32.541
God! What's going on?

48:32.583 --> 48:34.875
If that's how it is...

48:35.083 --> 48:38.166
-Give me a plate!
-Greece, what are you doing?

48:42.375 --> 48:43.875
-No such thing.
-Sir!

48:43.958 --> 48:46.375
-They're taunting me!
-Come on or we'll be disqualified.

48:46.458 --> 48:48.041
-Taunting who?
-No such thing!

48:48.083 --> 48:49.458
Come on, come on.

49:12.500 --> 49:16.958
<i>Your ancestors, your elders
Your descent, your fathers</i>

49:17.416 --> 49:22.125
<i>Your ancestors, your elders
Your descent, your fathers</i>

49:22.250 --> 49:26.750
<i>Turks have always been heroes</i>

49:27.125 --> 49:32.958
<i>Your armies, for so many times...</i>

49:33.625 --> 49:34.875
Halt!

49:45.916 --> 49:50.541
Welcome to Eurasia
Youth Athletic Games 2016!

49:52.000 --> 49:54.458
Why do you march so slowly?
You are messing up the whole march.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.541
Do we have to wait for you?

49:56.583 --> 49:58.458
What? What are you saying?

49:58.500 --> 50:00.166
What are you doing!

50:00.208 --> 50:02.916
Let it go. Don't bother.
Don't be Chinese with the Chinese.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.583
These people have suffered enough.
You see?

50:06.666 --> 50:07.750
I'm trying not to be bothered but...

50:07.791 --> 50:09.583
You don’t supposed to march this slow!
Are you nuts or what?

50:09.625 --> 50:11.750
Stop mumbling, I don't understand!

50:11.791 --> 50:13.333
Are you swearing or not?

50:13.458 --> 50:15.375
-I'll tear you into pieces!
-Calm down! Get a hold of yourself.

50:15.416 --> 50:19.041
Even your walls can't protect you here.
We'll bury you under your walls!

50:19.125 --> 50:21.625
We are Turkish!
See this? Look!

50:21.708 --> 50:23.916
We are from Central Asia, too!
Don't try me!

50:24.000 --> 50:26.083
You are a bunch of weirdos.

50:36.041 --> 50:37.583
-Is this the shot?
-Yes.

50:37.666 --> 50:40.083
The first country to compete is Bulgaria.

50:40.166 --> 50:42.208
Look at him.
What an animal.

50:42.291 --> 50:44.791
They have nothing to do,
they put shots every single day.

50:45.750 --> 50:47.250
Look, see the technique.

50:47.333 --> 50:50.458
-He holds it by his chin...
-OK. I got it.

50:50.875 --> 50:53.416
-18.20.
-Now, Germany.

50:53.541 --> 50:55.125
Panzer is coming.

50:55.166 --> 50:58.041
Germen! German!
Deutschland!

50:58.333 --> 51:01.291
What's up? Brother, are you Turkish?
Are you migrant?

51:01.375 --> 51:02.625
-Was?
-"Was" what?

51:02.708 --> 51:04.916
-Don't you understand Turkish?
-Sir, don't intervene.

51:04.958 --> 51:07.166
OK, sir. I'm trying to motivate him.

51:10.375 --> 51:11.416
20,15.

51:11.458 --> 51:13.041
And lastly, Turkey.

51:13.208 --> 51:15.083
It's our turn now!

51:15.166 --> 51:17.791
I believe in you.
You can do this!

51:18.583 --> 51:21.041
Respects. Greetings.

51:28.583 --> 51:30.000
Come on, Recep.

51:32.583 --> 51:33.833
Sir, go on.

51:33.916 --> 51:35.833
Tell that guy to move away.

51:35.875 --> 51:38.291
That's farther than the world record.
How will throw that far?

51:38.375 --> 51:40.583
The world record means nothing to me.

51:40.625 --> 51:42.833
I will break the universe record
in a moment.

51:42.916 --> 51:44.958
Tell him to move away.
Move away!

51:45.041 --> 51:46.125
Sir, please throw.

51:46.208 --> 51:48.333
I warned you.
All of you.

51:48.375 --> 51:51.416
-He is not making him move.
-It's fine by us. You may throw.

51:51.666 --> 51:53.583
God help me.

51:53.625 --> 51:54.958
Pin off!

52:00.875 --> 52:02.666
That's it!

52:02.833 --> 52:04.583
-What do you mean, red flag?
-The throw is invalid.

52:04.666 --> 52:06.458
-Invalid?
-You hit the guy in the head.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.708
-It's invalid!
-But I warned you!

52:08.791 --> 52:10.166
Didn't I warn you?

52:10.208 --> 52:12.791
If the shot gets in contact with
another object, the put is invalid.

52:12.833 --> 52:15.458
That object is your referee friend!

52:15.541 --> 52:18.541
Shame on you!
How can you call your friend an object?

52:18.625 --> 52:20.250
How can you?

52:20.416 --> 52:23.875
-Definitely invalid.
-I don't care. I don't!

52:24.083 --> 52:26.083
I don't care. I don't, I don't!

52:26.166 --> 52:30.875
You're always being unfair to Turkey!
That's enough!

52:30.916 --> 52:32.083
Now, Germany.

52:32.166 --> 52:35.833
This is outrageous! You can't be
this unfair just because we're Turkish!

52:36.375 --> 52:38.208
Enough! Same thing for years!

52:38.291 --> 52:40.083
I'm sick of this!

52:41.041 --> 52:43.125
They invalidated my record!

52:43.208 --> 52:46.083
-But that was a foul.
-I told him to move aside.

52:46.166 --> 52:48.000
I told him I would hit him in the head!

52:50.000 --> 52:52.375
In the third round,
here's Turkey.

52:52.458 --> 52:55.000
Now, watch me.
It won't be like last time.

52:55.250 --> 52:57.166
You invalidated my put last time.

53:03.625 --> 53:04.958
Sir, what are you doing?

53:05.000 --> 53:06.750
I love you, ref.
I love you.

53:07.416 --> 53:09.250
Let's see you invalidate this.

53:09.333 --> 53:11.416
This put is for you.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.916
Pin off. God help me!

53:18.416 --> 53:21.625
That's it! That's the record!
Raise it, raise the white flag!

53:21.666 --> 53:22.958
New world record!

53:23.041 --> 53:25.333
That's it! What's up? Huh?

53:26.208 --> 53:28.416
See that? Eat it!

53:28.541 --> 53:30.458
Lined up like a bunch of idiots.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.958
Get ready!

53:34.125 --> 53:36.583
Ref! I'm sorry. Time out!

53:36.666 --> 53:38.416
Ref, time out.
What did I say?

53:38.500 --> 53:40.000
Didn't I tell you to take the first lane?

53:40.041 --> 53:41.625
Why aren't you doing so?

53:41.666 --> 53:44.416
Sir, the race is about to begin.
Get out of the track, please!

53:46.083 --> 53:48.000
Are you pulling a gun on me?

53:48.041 --> 53:50.000
Are you actually pulling a gun on me?

53:50.041 --> 53:51.333
Pull the trigger!

53:51.375 --> 53:54.208
Pull the damn thing! Go on!

53:54.250 --> 53:56.875
Pull the trigger!
If you aim a gun, you have to shoot it!

53:56.916 --> 53:59.500
Pull the trigger if you call yourself a man!
You don't carry that for nothing!

53:59.666 --> 54:01.750
Come on, Miray! Come on!

54:01.791 --> 54:03.708
-Come on, my girl.
-Come on, Miray.

54:10.625 --> 54:13.416
That's it! That's it!

54:14.500 --> 54:16.458
Merve, do you want a ladder just in case?

54:16.500 --> 54:18.791
Go away. I can't deal with you right now!

54:18.833 --> 54:21.208
You damn women.
Go on, jump.

54:24.166 --> 54:27.166
She did it! Good girl.
Tiny girl jumps over mountains!

54:29.750 --> 54:31.875
-See how he jumps?
-Yes, I see.

54:31.916 --> 54:33.666
As if you are jumping into
your truck's dumper.

54:33.708 --> 54:35.166
Alright. I'm going.

54:39.166 --> 54:40.916
Come here.
What are you doing?

54:40.958 --> 54:42.166
-What?
-Dude, what are you doing?

54:42.208 --> 54:43.666
-I jumped.
-You jumped?

54:43.708 --> 54:45.875
Dude! Dude! Stop!

54:45.916 --> 54:47.500
What kind of a jump was that?

54:48.125 --> 54:50.875
That's Russia.
She's one hell of a Russian.

54:55.958 --> 54:57.208
15,20.

54:57.250 --> 54:59.375
Come on, come on! Let's go!

54:59.416 --> 55:01.625
Look at her standing.

55:01.791 --> 55:04.875
Like a grizzly bear waiting for
salmons in the river!

55:04.916 --> 55:07.791
-Look at her might!
-God's sake.

55:09.958 --> 55:12.958
16,50. You go girl!
Give me five!

55:13.000 --> 55:15.250
Three, four, throw!

55:17.000 --> 55:20.208
That's it! That's it!

55:20.250 --> 55:21.916
Turkey! Turkey!

55:23.250 --> 55:25.833
Psst! Ukraine!

55:26.666 --> 55:28.750
Careful not to sit on it.

55:30.125 --> 55:31.416
Go on, jump.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.041
-Step it up!
-Come on, Zeynep!

55:33.125 --> 55:34.416
Run, girl!

55:34.625 --> 55:37.875
Like a three-year old purebred!
She is a late bloomer!

55:38.000 --> 55:41.125
She is running and running!
And she's done it!

55:41.208 --> 55:43.833
We got the gold!
We got the gold!

55:43.875 --> 55:45.916
Jump, jump for the motherland!

55:47.541 --> 55:50.041
God help us.

55:52.708 --> 55:54.250
He did it! White flag!

55:54.333 --> 55:57.041
-The gold medal goes to Turkey.
-We got the gold!

55:57.083 --> 55:58.708
We got the gold!

56:20.791 --> 56:24.875
The sun has set in the first day
but there is still a night ahead of us.

56:25.125 --> 56:27.916
We have watched men's long jump.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.416
Turkey wasted their first two attempts
by stepping on the line.

56:32.458 --> 56:35.541
The Greek athlete is next.
He gets ready.

56:35.583 --> 56:37.791
Let's see how far he jumps.

56:42.291 --> 56:45.166
A nice jump.
Let's see the result.

56:46.083 --> 56:47.583
-What did he do?
-7,30.

56:47.708 --> 56:49.958
7,30? Come on!

56:50.125 --> 56:51.625
That's too far.

56:51.750 --> 56:54.416
Please beat his record.
Please, Recep.

56:54.458 --> 56:57.833
And please don't step on the line.
You have to jump without stepping on it.

56:57.875 --> 57:00.875
-I'm begging you.
-I'm not used to it.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.208
I've spent my life wearing leather shoes.
I'm not used to sneakers.

57:04.291 --> 57:06.791
My body is rejecting them.
That's why I'm stepping on it.

57:06.833 --> 57:08.458
I'll go barefoot. Hold this.

57:08.541 --> 57:11.083
-But...
-Take it off. I'll jump barefoot.

57:11.375 --> 57:14.500
Take this off, too.
Take it off. Barefoot.

57:14.583 --> 57:16.583
I'll go barefoot.

57:16.666 --> 57:18.791
However you wish,
but your feet will hurt!

57:18.833 --> 57:22.250
It won't hurt! I was always running around
like this when I was a child.

57:22.333 --> 57:24.583
Even in winter,
when it was raining or snowing...

57:24.666 --> 57:28.250
...we would walk to school with only socks.
Through hills, we walked ten miles every day.

57:28.291 --> 57:30.916
There was another school five miles away
but I chose the further one.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.125
I got lost this one time, you see.

57:33.208 --> 57:35.666
There were my footprints in the mud.
The police were searching for me.

57:35.708 --> 57:38.583
A team from America came over
and took the dried up mud...

57:38.625 --> 57:41.875
...and displayed it in a museum
as the oldest human footprint for five months.

57:41.916 --> 57:43.583
Then they realized it was mine.

57:43.625 --> 57:46.416
There was a particle from my sock in it,
then they figured it out.

57:46.583 --> 57:49.250
OK. I just want you to beat that jerk.

57:49.375 --> 57:52.083
I will, I will.
I will beat that Yannis jerk.

57:52.166 --> 57:54.250
But with my own special technique.

57:54.333 --> 57:56.791
You see? I will plunge forward
right before the line...

57:56.875 --> 57:58.791
...I will do a cannonball,
you know?

57:58.833 --> 58:02.583
I will gain momentum,
and like the cannons of Mehmet the Conqueror...

58:02.625 --> 58:04.458
...I will bury that
Byzantine spawn into the sand.

58:04.541 --> 58:06.083
You're done for!

58:07.875 --> 58:09.208
Are you calling me?

58:09.500 --> 58:10.541
Me? Who?

58:10.583 --> 58:12.916
-Yes, it's your turn.
-I can't tell who you are looking at.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.083
You cross-eyed geezer.

58:14.166 --> 58:16.916
Your right eye says "Get out",
and the other one says "Please, stay."

58:17.000 --> 58:19.291
I can't understand what you're saying.
Just announce 3169!

58:19.375 --> 58:20.791
3169, Turkey.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.125
Come on, Recep!

58:22.291 --> 58:25.041
And lastly, Turkey.

58:25.208 --> 58:28.791
Recep Ivedik represents the Turkish team.

58:56.208 --> 58:58.166
-Invalid.
-What do you mean invalid?

58:58.208 --> 59:00.833
It can't be invalid.
That's not possible!

59:00.875 --> 59:02.875
I didn't step on the line.
Watch the replay.

59:08.625 --> 59:10.958
Well, he did not step on it.
The jump is valid.

59:11.041 --> 59:13.250
Of course I didn't.
It is valid.

59:13.583 --> 59:16.666
Idiot. He's flagging for everything.
"Invalid, invalid."

59:16.750 --> 59:18.000
What's the result?

59:18.208 --> 59:20.666
-7,28.
-Ref, it can't be 7,28.

59:20.750 --> 59:24.375
He jumped 7,30, right?
Please, help me out here.

59:24.416 --> 59:27.291
-Just add four centimetres. Make it 7,32.
-Sir, we can't do that.

59:27.375 --> 59:29.625
Why not? You can do anything
when you put your heart into it.

59:29.708 --> 59:31.708
It's just you and me.
Help me out here.

59:31.750 --> 59:34.250
-I can't, sir.
-Come on, man. I'll do anything.

59:34.291 --> 59:35.833
-Get off of me.
-Be the bigger man...

59:35.875 --> 59:38.583
-...I'm begging you. Just do it.
-No, sir.

59:38.666 --> 59:40.625
How can we? The result is there.

59:40.791 --> 59:42.791
You wash my back and I'll wash yours.
Get it?

59:42.833 --> 59:43.791
I don't get it.

59:43.833 --> 59:45.791
The Moldavian group is coming soon.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.000
We'll have fun together.

59:47.041 --> 59:48.583
Sir, come to your senses.

59:48.750 --> 59:52.750
Don't you get it, fun with the Moldavians?
Please, don't make me jump through hoops.

59:52.791 --> 59:56.375
-We can't do that. It's 7,28.
-No, it's not. 37, he said 7,37.

59:56.416 --> 59:58.333
-7,37.
-No, 7,28.

59:58.416 --> 01:00:01.333
He measured 37 first then rolled it back.
I have the trace right here.

01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:04.416
-It's 7,28.
-7,28. I put it down.

01:00:04.666 --> 01:00:06.750
God damn you!

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:08.541
-Don't curse.
-Button it.

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:11.166
You gave me silver.
I have silver because of you.

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.166
-Recep, are you alright?
-Get me out of here.

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.875
-Stop asking if I'm OK, idiot.
-Here.

01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:15.916
-Quickly.
-Come on.

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:17.083
Pull me out.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:24.708
Will you?
I have a great offer for you.

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:26.416
Two silvers, one gold.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.250
Two silvers, one bronze
and you give me this.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.958
Two silvers, three bronzes.

01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:33.708
Give me this. What more do you want?
You want my pants?

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:42.208
Nurullah. Nurullah?

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:45.166
Where is Nurullah?

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.458
Where is Nurullah?

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.791
I'm going to ungag you
but you won't scream, OK?

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.833
-Thank god!
-Shut it!

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:56.416
-Shut up. Where is Nurullah?
-How should I know?

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.333
He got bored and he got out to find...

01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:01.000
...a café and have some fresh air.

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:04.041
Then he left me here alone.

01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:07.291
-Are there any cafés nearby, Akif?
-There isn't any.

01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:09.833
There is only a sports bar open.
Maybe he went there?

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.916
That slimy Nurullah.
We leave this guy for him to look after...

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.166
...and he goes out to a bar
to chase women.

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.500
Tell you what, please untie me.
Please.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.750
Your punishment is not over yet.
I won't untie you.

01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:24.291
-But I say please, Mr. Recep.
-I see I am "Mr. Recep" now.

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.375
What was it?
Didn't you call us jerks earlier?

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:28.666
What happened?

01:01:28.708 --> 01:01:30.625
You see these here?
Look at them.

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:32.375
-See?
-They're medals.

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:36.000
You said we wouldn't get any.
Let me put these on you...

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:38.791
...here, so that you'll come to your senses.

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:40.666
Cling, cling, cling.

01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:43.166
We used to have cows.
Dumb cows.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.750
We used to put bells on them.

01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:46.500
They would walk around like that.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:49.333
Come on, you sit here a little while more.

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:51.500
-You just sit here.
-OK, enough!

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.875
Sit here. Gag him.

01:01:53.916 --> 01:01:56.291
What are you doing, Akif?
You, as well? Please!

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.958
Like that. OK, beautiful.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:01.083
-Come on, let's find Nurullah.
-OK.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:03.291
Just sit here quietly, alright?

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:04.666
I won't hear a noise.

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:07.583
Not a single noise. You get it?

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:18.458
Hello, guys.

01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:20.083
Hello, Recep.

01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:23.041
I see you are treating
yourselves with fruit cocktails.

01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:25.958
Nice girls around, right?
Some good conversation...

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.916
-Bon appétit, Nurullah.
-Thank you.

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.833
-I just got here.
-You just got here?

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:32.875
If only you could work less
and come here even earlier, right?

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.041
Get up. Get up!

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:37.458
Athletes don't take alcohol!
Get out!

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.208
You are the Turkish group.
I'll have a talk with you later, fatty.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.750
Get out!

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:44.250
You are just like a commander.
Excellent!

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:47.000
Of course.
You can't leave these guys alone.

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:49.458
They need to be controlled
or else they will run around like animals.

01:02:50.708 --> 01:02:52.958
I couldn't say no to such a beautiful lady.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.875
Give me the tray.

01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:56.791
Get out of here!

01:02:56.875 --> 01:02:58.625
-What are you doing?
-Getting the tray.

01:02:58.666 --> 01:03:00.416
You just kicked the guys out
and you're drinking yourself.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.166
The girl gave it to me herself.

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:03.416
Didn't you see?

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:05.958
-No, Recep. Please.
-Come on. Take one.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.291
-We have a game tomorrow.
-Come on, bottoms up.

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:10.166
To today's medals.

01:03:10.208 --> 01:03:12.250
Bottoms up. Alright.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.583
That's the stuff.

01:03:16.666 --> 01:03:18.708
-What are you laughing at?
-The girls are laughing at us.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:20.583
Which girls?

01:03:21.041 --> 01:03:22.708
-They are laughing at us?
-Yes.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.000
-Then let's go and talk to them.
-I can't. I'm shy.

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:27.166
There's nothing to be shy about.
Just follow me.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:30.000
-Girls, hello.
-Hello.

01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:31.625
-Athletes?
-Yes.

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:34.791
Me, too. See, Turkish athlete.
Recep Ivedik.

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:36.500
-What's your name?
-Irina.

01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:37.708
-Yours?
-Natali.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:40.125
And this is Akif.
Akif is my assistant.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:42.500
-Tiny assistant.
-Tiny.

01:03:43.208 --> 01:03:44.916
See, they like you.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:47.041
Don't let his looks fool you.

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:48.541
Not everything he has is tiny.

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:51.000
Tiny guys are the real deal. Get it?

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:53.791
See, it's time.
Girls, want some?

01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:57.166
Come on, bottoms up.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:04:00.041
Na zdrovje. Na zdrovje.
Bottoms up.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.500
We have a game tomorrow.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:08.583
Where are you going?

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:12.875
-Why are they leaving?
-They did the shots and left.

01:04:12.958 --> 01:04:15.458
You're right.
All we wanted was a little chat.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.666
Take the tray.

01:04:16.708 --> 01:04:18.291
OK.

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:23.000
I am a little high.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:27.416
Hey, people!
Are you having fun!

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:33.583
Are you ready to eat hotdogs?

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:34.625
She says hotdog.

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:39.291
Then it's time for the hotdog rodeo!

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:44.958
This night is all about two things.
One is to eat the most hotdogs.

01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:48.375
And the second is to
ride the rode the longest.

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:51.208
Now I want two volunteers.

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.875
Me! Take me. Let me be
one of the volunteers.

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:56.625
I see you, come here Greece!

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:58.500
-Who did she pick?
-The Greek.

01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:01.250
Who wants to challenge Greece?

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:03.083
-Calamity Jane. See here?
-Let's see.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.083
The Turk against the Greek.
Calamity Jane, pick me!

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.875
Let's see the hands!

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:09.125
Me, me, Calamity! See!

01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:11.083
Come here, Turkey!

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:13.166
-OK, thanks.
-Yes!

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:16.333
Give it up for Turkey!

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.666
Give it up!

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.583
The competitors are ready.

01:05:23.666 --> 01:05:25.958
Excitement is in the air.
What is your name?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.958
Hello. My name is Niko.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.708
Hello. My name is Recep Ivedik.

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:34.333
I'm coming from Turkey.
And I don't wish any luck to my opponent.

01:05:34.708 --> 01:05:37.333
And Miss Calamity,
I want to add this...

01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:40.250
...this guy has been
getting on my nerves since the feast.

01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:42.666
So I'll double my efforts.

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:44.000
It's good that you picked him.

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:46.333
We'll see who's doubling their efforts.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:48.541
We'll see whose ass will be kicked.

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:52.666
-Damn idiot.
-Then I'm starting the contest.

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:57.250
Three, two, one!

01:06:26.041 --> 01:06:28.708
Turkey wins!

01:06:28.791 --> 01:06:30.375
That's it!

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:33.583
Don't stare at me.

01:06:33.666 --> 01:06:35.500
Now it's time for the rodeo.

01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:38.291
Niko, would you like to say something?

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:40.833
I used to do rodeo with my family
when I was one year old.

01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:43.000
We used to go to rodeo tours.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.583
He is ambitious.

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.666
Looks like they're a cow family.

01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:52.041
Now, to the contest!

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.833
Hit the music!

01:06:57.375 --> 01:07:00.750
I bet he won't be able to ride this thing
for more than five seconds.

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:02.333
Look at him.

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:15.541
Niko has fallen down. Give it up for Niko.
Niko, come here please.

01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:16.916
Come here, Niko.

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:21.541
Now it's Recep Ivedik's turn!

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.125
-Is this it?
-It's easy, isn't it?

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:34.958
-I thought it would be harder.
-You can do it!

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.750
It's so easy.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.083
-What's going on?
-It's speeding up. Hold on!

01:07:40.208 --> 01:07:41.916
Dude! Hey!

01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:43.958
God! Akif!

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:46.375
-Akif, make it stop!
-OK, that's enough.

01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:49.166
-Akif, make it stop!
-Hey, stop it!

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:51.458
-It got stuck, I can't.
-Akif, what's going on?

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.208
Akif, I can't hold on.
It's too fast. God!

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.708
-Oh, no!
-God!

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:57.916
Stop it, stop it!

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.833
I'm going to throw up.

01:07:59.916 --> 01:08:01.583
Recep, don't!

01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:04.166
-I am going to, Akif.
-He's getting sick!

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:06.833
Please don't, Recep.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.166
-Stop it!
-Don't throw up!

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:16.082
I can't believe it.
Damn it!

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.582
I can't believe it!

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.375
I threw up.

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:38.791
Recep, I cannot believe you!

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:40.791
Recep, wake up!

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:44.125
-Another 15 minutes.
-We don't have 15 minutes. We're late.

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:46.625
-Come on, Recep.
-OK, I'll be there in five.

01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:49.500
We don't have five minutes.
We're going to miss weight lifting.

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:51.375
-Miss weight lifting?
-Yes.

01:08:52.082 --> 01:08:53.957
-What time is it?
-It's 11:00.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.541
Weight lifting has begun at 10:00.

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:58.332
It's one of the most important contests
and you're sleeping like a log!

01:08:58.416 --> 01:08:59.707
How did I end up here?

01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:02.291
How should I know?
Come on, we have to go!

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:11.000
Sir, our athlete is ready.

01:09:11.041 --> 01:09:13.832
-How many attempts do we have left?
-You've missed the snatch.

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:17.291
You have one attempt left in clean and jerk.
The contest is about to end.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.125
-Oh, come on!
-What did he say?

01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:21.957
We don't have a chance
for a medal in weight lifting.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.457
How come?
We are here, aren't we?

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.750
-They are still lifting.
-It's the last round of clean and jerk.

01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:27.582
They do the snatch first,
then clean and jerk.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:29.791
So what? So what?

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:32.332
Should we cry like babies?
Make him register us.

01:09:32.375 --> 01:09:33.666
You're already registered.

01:09:33.707 --> 01:09:36.666
You have to lift twice the weight
they have lifted in two attempts.

01:09:36.707 --> 01:09:38.625
They lift 140 kilos in one attempt!

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.916
So you have to lift 300 kilos
in one attempt!

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.416
-One attempt?
-Yes.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.291
-300 kilos?
-300 kilos.

01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:46.957
Let me think.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:49.500
I can do it. Register me.

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:51.000
By God, I can. Register me.

01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:54.041
Recep, it's against the laws of physics.
It's not possible.

01:09:54.082 --> 01:09:56.666
-Why don't you understand?
-Button it. Button it!

01:09:57.583 --> 01:09:59.666
It may be hard but it's not impossible.

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:01.666
You haven't witnessed Recep's true power.

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:04.666
I don't let my mouth write a check
that my ass can't cash.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:06.625
Register me. Don't drive me crazy.

01:10:06.666 --> 01:10:09.541
-We have to tell them the weight.
-OK, let's. How much do we need?

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:12.583
We have to pass 310 kilos.
I'll tell them 312,5 then.

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:15.208
What? 312,5?

01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:17.625
I don't do decimals.

01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:19.666
What do you take me for?
I'm Recep Ivedik!

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:21.791
Just round it up to 350. 350!

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:24.916
Come on, Recep!
How can you lift 350 kilos in one attempt?

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:27.375
If I can lift 312,5, I might as well lift 350.

01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:29.833
Tell them 350.
It has a sentimental value for me.

01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:32.583
My great grandfather was from Izmir,
35 is Izmir's plate code.

01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:34.416
-Alright.
-Go!

01:10:34.916 --> 01:10:36.958
Hey! Psst! Ukraine!

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.625
Ukraine! What's up?

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:42.583
I'll end you.

01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:44.500
I'll take the bar and stick it in you!

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.916
What? Come on!

01:11:02.416 --> 01:11:03.833
OK, Bulgaria is up.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.208
-What's that?
-Ammonia.

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:11.083
Ammonia? Why?
Is that doping?

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:13.000
-It's stimulating.
-Is that so?

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:15.166
It picks him up.
Something like a shock.

01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:16.625
I see.

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:23.375
Clean and jerk, third attempt.
Bulgaria, 170 kilos.

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:28.125
Clean and jerk, third attempt.
Turkey will lift 350 kilos.

01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:30.125
Adem, give me your shoe.

01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.666
Instead of ammonia.
For stimulation.

01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:43.208
I'm good to go.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:46.041
Come on!

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:53.500
Recep, come on.

01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:56.583
Don't put it on there.

01:12:00.458 --> 01:12:02.541
The clock is ticking. Please!

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:24.750
Come on.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.333
No, I can't.

01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.166
Not possible. I can't, Akif.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.750
Push it! Push it!

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:41.500
I can't. It's not possible.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:44.791
God!

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:46.541
God!

01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.583
-Akif!
-Recep?

01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:50.708
My pants are tearing up.

01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:54.041
Tearing up for real.
I'm hearing it!

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:55.875
Nobody is looking at your ass.
Keep pushing!

01:12:55.916 --> 01:12:57.458
How unfortunate.

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:00.791
Just in the right position.
God damn it!

01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:02.958
-My ass, Akif!
-Your ass is looking at the wall!

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.708
It happens! Come on!

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.166
Do it, Recep!

01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:18.416
Come on, Recep.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:20.916
For Turkey.
Do it for Turkey.

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:30.625
He did it! That's it!

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:33.583
An incredible record!
350 kilos!

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:37.916
Recep Ivedik breaks the world record!
Give it up for Recep Ivedik!

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:39.333
Drop it! Drop it!

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:41.541
Recep, drop it!

01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:43.416
Drop it!

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.875
Recep?

01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:46.250
He's locked in!

01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:47.666
Recep!

01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:51.625
He fell down! Go!

01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:53.041
Recep!

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:56.166
-Give us a hand!
-He got locked in!

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.250
-His hands are locked in!
-Open his hands!

01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:06.291
Gentlemen, 350 is no joke.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.000
When you actually lift it...

01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:10.833
...the gravity adds 10 times more weight.

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:14.833
It's such a weight that
your veins literally open up.

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:16.750
Then a great pressure is put on your heart.

01:14:16.791 --> 01:14:19.541
Then aorta stops pumping blood.

01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:22.833
Then the whole central nervous
system shuts down.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.708
My neurons stopped working.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:27.416
My body blocked itself from all functions.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.166
Then all the fluids were drained from
my limbs and they got locked in.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:33.708
When they got locked in,
I saw a bright light.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:37.625
Then I must have fallen down,
I don't remember the rest.

01:14:37.708 --> 01:14:41.125
It's getting warm in here.
Are you pissing or what?

01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:43.750
-I'm not pissing, Recep.
-You certainly are, Nurullah.

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:45.541
It's getting warmer and warmer.

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:47.583
-I'm upset with you anyway.
-And why is that?

01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:50.250
You kept drinking
after you kicked us out last night.

01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:52.583
Be thankful that
I haven't sent you back to Turkey.

01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:54.458
Idiot! You left your post!

01:14:54.541 --> 01:14:57.083
To have some fresh air.
You're exaggerating.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:14:59.708
Shut up. Fresh air my ass. Idiot.

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:02.833
-Hey, Recep!
-Hello, tiny assistant!

01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:05.875
Irina and Natali.
What's up, girls?

01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:08.875
You did the shots
and left right away last night.

01:15:08.958 --> 01:15:10.083
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:12.791
-You want to get in?
-Yes, but there's no room.

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:16.125
Of course there's room for you, dear.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:18.333
Get out! There are two nice ladies here.

01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:19.791
Where is your manners?

01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:22.333
You've been sitting
in the water like a hippo. Get out!

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.125
Come on! Leave!

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:25.750
Come in girls, please.

01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:28.000
Come in. Alright.

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.833
Let's have some fun.
How have you been doing?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.791
-Did you break a record today?
-Yes, I did. I lifted 350 kilos.

01:15:34.875 --> 01:15:38.125
-Wow, you must be very strong.
-Damn right I am.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.291
I can lift anything.
I drop them only when I get locked in.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:42.250
Girls, what are you doing here?

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:44.750
-Just having a conversation.
-Why?

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:48.375
Go back to your rooms!
Right now! Quickly!

01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:51.000
-What's he saying?
-He says "davai". He told them to leave.

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:53.833
-Why did you send them away?
-Those girls are on my team, get it?

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:58.083
-You'll stay away.
-I will? Who is asking for your permission?

01:15:58.125 --> 01:16:00.375
You will ask.
Don't go near those girls, get it?

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:02.458
Who do you think you are?
I will break your face!

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.083
-Bring it on! Do you want to die?
-Piss off!

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:06.750
Recep, please!

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:08.916
-Kill me if you dare! Come on!
-I'll see you at the finals.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.958
-I will see you in the ring.
-To hell with your finals.

01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:13.250
Kill me here if you dare!
Come on!

01:16:13.333 --> 01:16:16.125
There are rules in the ring,
but not in the streets!

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:17.833
Fight me in the streets if you dare!

01:16:17.916 --> 01:16:21.333
I will put your eyes out,
slash your mouth open, bash your head in!

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.416
Who is that jerk?

01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:24.666
The Russian boxer Nikolay
I told you about.

01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:27.666
-Are we going to fight him tomorrow?
-Most probably, if we get to the finals.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.208
Nikolay, you'll see a whole
different side of Recep tomorrow.

01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:33.291
The legal side and the illegal side,
remember?

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.666
This is my illegal side, friends.

01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:36.708
Akif, come with me.

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:46.166
Come in. Put the bonnet on.
Come on.

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.750
Like the girl in The Ring.
I got scared.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:53.041
Get well soon.
Recep, why are we here?

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:56.416
We'll find the lab.
All we have to do is to find the lab.

01:16:56.833 --> 01:16:59.125
When I first examined the patient,
he panicked.

01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:02.000
He asked me what was going on.
I told him to lay down.

01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:04.208
You little... Come on.

01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:06.750
Come over here.

01:17:06.833 --> 01:17:09.458
Hurry up. This is the lab
I've been looking for.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.541
I'll make wonders in here.

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:14.333
For God's sake,
will you tell me why we are here?

01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:15.625
We'll get caught, Recep!

01:17:15.666 --> 01:17:18.833
I'll prepare doping for the fight tomorrow.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:21.083
Will you do doping?
It would show up in the tests.

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:23.458
Why would I do it? Why?

01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:25.708
Idiot! Do I look like I need doping?

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:27.750
I'll make Nikolay use it.

01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:30.583
There is a special recipe
we prepare for our race horses.

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:32.708
I'll give him that and
the dude will go nuts.

01:17:32.791 --> 01:17:35.250
What happens if he does doping or not?
It won't do us good.

01:17:37.125 --> 01:17:39.083
It's so hard to talk to an ignorant like you.

01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:42.625
It is frustrating when a person
can't find someone equal to talk to.

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:44.708
-That hurts.
-So what?

01:17:44.791 --> 01:17:46.416
You ignorant fool.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:49.250
Listen, we'll give the doping to Russia.

01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:51.333
-Who is Russia fighting against?
-Bulgaria.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:53.625
Let's say Russia wipes the floor
with Bulgaria.

01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:54.375
Sure.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:55.958
-The game is over.
-It is.

01:17:56.041 --> 01:17:59.291
Then we will them the committee
that they have used doping.

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.833
We'll say they have done it.
The committee will look into it.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.916
-Will the test come positive?
-It will.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.750
-Then Russia will be...
-Disqualified.

01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:08.708
Exactly. Bulgaria will get to the finals.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.583
A beat up and tired Bulgaria.

01:18:11.625 --> 01:18:14.625
Then we'll give them
a slap or two in the finals...

01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:16.083
...and become the champions.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.750
This is the most diabolical plan
I have heard lately.

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:20.125
I wouldn't even dream about it.

01:18:20.166 --> 01:18:22.083
If you could,
you would be in Harvard.

01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:24.833
Or Yale or Princeton in America.

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:28.208
Get it? Or in France,
in Bourbon University.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.500
Or in Oxford, Cambridge in England.

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:33.458
You could be anywhere. But no.
If I had been given the chance...

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.000
...I would be unstoppable.
But now look at me. Get it?

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:38.708
OK, how are we going to do this?

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.875
That's the tricky part.
I will put it in this. You see this?

01:18:42.166 --> 01:18:44.166
-Delights.
-Not delights, it's Turkish delight.

01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:48.083
Let's take this tube.
100 cl tube.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:50.375
Give me some ostarine.
20 mg of ostarine.

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:52.541
And the stable factor.

01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.958
OK, let it stabilize.
And some beta-TG.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.083
See, these are all molecules.
Look.

01:18:57.125 --> 01:18:59.708
EGF molecules.
EGF makes you go crazy.

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:02.125
This is the real deal.
Goes right into the brain.

01:19:02.166 --> 01:19:04.625
Neutrons pick it up instantly.
Brain neutrons.

01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:07.125
I'll use agonists.
Agonists.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.416
Sulphuric acid.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:12.916
I don't know what this is, but I think
it would help somehow. Let's put some.

01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:14.916
-Like that.
-Stop! Be careful!

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:17.666
Shake it up nicely and then...

01:19:17.791 --> 01:19:20.333
...a pinch of magnesium sulphate.

01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:23.041
-Have some. Here.
-Recep, stop. That's acid!

01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:24.458
-Taste it.
-No, Recep!

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.500
-You can't taste acid!
-It will get rid of your microbes.

01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:28.583
-No way.
-All the microbes will go away. Here.

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:29.916
Please, Recep!

01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:31.833
Oh my, oh my...

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.083
See? It cleans your whole lungs.

01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:39.083
All the way into your bronchus.

01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:43.875
Veterinarian needle. Even the horses jump
when you inject them with this.

01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:47.083
You open this up and pour the stuff in it.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:49.791
-Beautiful. Look.
-Be careful. It's acid!

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:51.916
Acid won't do you harm.
Wait a second.

01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:54.875
-It won't do you harm.
-Recep, it's acid!

01:19:54.916 --> 01:19:57.000
Please, Recep!

01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:58.583
-See?
-Recep, what are you doing?

01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:01.541
Smear it to your face.
It makes you look shiny.

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:04.708
It will prevent acnes.
Now, take some of this.

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.833
And fill it in this. Here.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:09.083
Line up the ones I've prepared.

01:20:09.291 --> 01:20:13.083
Beautiful. Wrap them in napkins.
In napkins!

01:20:21.708 --> 01:20:23.750
Hello there, Dobrovichs.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.416
What? What do you want?

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:29.625
Don't get all riled up.
Don't be aggressive.

01:20:29.708 --> 01:20:31.625
I understand you're a tough guy...

01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:33.375
...but I'm as tough as you,
if not more.

01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:36.458
We've come to apologize
because of yesterday's incident.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.958
We've come with good intentions.
As friends...

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.125
We're neighbours after all.

01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:43.541
We almost had a clash yesterday
as two nations.

01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:46.250
Why should it be like this?
Why should there be hostility?

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:48.583
Let's be friends.
We have a boxing match with you today.

01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:51.208
That's why we thought about it
last night and realized we were wrong.

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.666
And we searched for ways to make up for it.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.875
And we've brought these.
Turkish delight, do you want some?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.708
No, thanks. OK, we're good.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.833
I know we're good but take one
for our friendship.

01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:03.541
Don't leave me hanging.
Have one. Take one.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.375
Please? Take one.

01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:06.541
Should I?

01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:09.375
-I don’t know.
-Be careful. Just take one.

01:21:09.833 --> 01:21:11.250
Have one.

01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:13.166
Davai davai.

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:16.625
Davai davai. Bon appétit.

01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:18.666
How about you?
None for you.

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:20.125
You? None for you, too.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.333
Only for you because you're the boss.
Have one more.

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:25.333
-That's enough, thanks.
-Take one more. One is not enough.

01:21:25.375 --> 01:21:28.458
It's in our culture to
insist on taking a second one.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.375
It's the tradition. Take one.
I insist. Take one.

01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:32.791
He keeps insisting.

01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:34.458
Yes, it's delicious.

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:35.666
Look.

01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:39.416
If you feel a little energetic somehow,
that's because of the delight.

01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:41.250
Get it? It has a strong effect.

01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:43.916
Take care of yourselves.
We've become friends, we've made peace.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:46.541
Well then, see you all later. Bye!

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.750
Idiot! Do whatever you want.

01:21:51.833 --> 01:21:54.083
Look at this neck.

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:03.958
Welcome to men's boxing matches...

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:06.750
...of Eurasia Youth Athletic Games 2016.

01:22:08.416 --> 01:22:10.750
Look over there.
Russia is coming.

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:13.583
Look at him.
They can't hold him.

01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:16.291
He turned into an animal.
Look at him.

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.708
He turned into a killing machine.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:20.958
Do you think he took something?
He doesn't look normal.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.250
What could he take?
Stop with the blaming game already.

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:28.625
That's how rumours start.
What could he have taken?

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:31.625
He must have taken delights at most.
What else could it be?

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:34.583
Maybe Turkish delight.

01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:41.333
Now, he will face and destroy Bulgaria.

01:22:41.416 --> 01:22:44.541
You'll see how much fun we will have then.

01:22:48.708 --> 01:22:51.375
Bulgarian team has withdrawn.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.583
-What?
-Bulgarians have withdrawn.

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:55.375
-Withdrawn?
-I repeat.

01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:57.708
Bulgarian boxer has withdrawn
from the game.

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.833
How could he?
How is this possible?

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.375
He was just eating a sandwich
in the cafeteria.

01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:05.875
As per the committee ruling,
Russia will go on to the finals directly.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.125
The final between Turkey and Russia
shall begin ten minutes later.

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:12.541
Oh God! How come?

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:14.708
Sir, that's not possible!
It can't be!

01:23:14.791 --> 01:23:17.833
That's impossible!
I have just boxed!

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:19.833
I just got out of a fight.
I'm not ready, I'm tired.

01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:21.500
Committee's decision,
nothing can be done.

01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:24.291
You'll be the end of us!

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.916
Sir, please don't do this.
Check the decision again.

01:23:26.958 --> 01:23:30.541
-This decision can't be possible.
-Sir, there is nothing I can do.

01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:32.958
-Committee has decided.
-Do you take us for roosters?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.833
Are you pitting roosters against each other,
or pit bulls?

01:23:35.916 --> 01:23:37.625
How can they decide without asking us?

01:23:37.666 --> 01:23:39.666
It should be in the afternoon,
why would I fight now?

01:23:39.708 --> 01:23:42.333
-Sir, there is nothing I can do.
-He doesn't even look normal.

01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:44.541
-Look at him.
-God!

01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:46.541
Did you see that?
He is making gestures.

01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:48.666
He means to cut my head off!

01:23:48.708 --> 01:23:51.083
Does he look normal?
Just look at him.

01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:53.833
-He looks like a normal athlete.
-Normal how?

01:23:53.875 --> 01:23:55.958
We object!
He definitely took doping!

01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:58.875
-We want him to be tested right now.
-Doping is tested post-game.

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:01.083
-We can't do it before.
-What do you mean post-game?

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:03.333
Why would I need him to be tested
after I got beaten?

01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:05.875
Be ready in five minutes.
The match will begin.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:09.000
God. We're screwed.

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:12.458
Hunters have become the prey.
Look at him!

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:15.583
Akif, he's going to devour us.

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:20.041
Why did I even feed him two delights?

01:24:20.083 --> 01:24:21.500
He must have overdosed.

01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:24.708
The results were different
with the race horses.

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.875
Athletes, come here.

01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:29.916
Ref, you're going to kill us.
For the love of God, cancel the match.

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:31.791
Look at him, he's gone mad.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.666
-I want a clean game.
-How can it be clean?

01:24:34.708 --> 01:24:36.541
How can a match with him be clean?

01:24:36.583 --> 01:24:37.833
Shake hands.

01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:39.625
Now you’re mine!
You won’t get out of here alive.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:42.000
What are you saying?
What language is it? What?

01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.666
This is it, I will kill you.

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.541
He must be cursing my whole family.
He's going to end me.

01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:48.208
You’re mine!

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:51.333
God help me! He is coming!

01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:53.166
He is coming!

01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:55.750
Run away, run!

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:58.666
God! Look, your trainer is saying something.

01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:03.000
God! His bones turned into steel!

01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:05.875
He is as hard as a rock!
Throw the towel! Throw the towel!

01:25:06.083 --> 01:25:08.083
-Come on, hurry!
-Here it comes! Catch!

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:09.958
Do you call this a throw?

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:13.791
Recep?

01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.750
What are you doing?
Say something.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.958
God, help him!

01:25:19.125 --> 01:25:21.000
Say something, I'm scared!

01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:23.375
Recep!

01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:25.833
Recep?

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:28.250
What is this place?

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:32.750
-You're that bad?
-Sir, a glass of ayran and a lahmacun please.

01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:34.958
-Doctor! Doctor!
-The match is over.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.041
-Grandma? The bowtie suits you.
-Grandma?

01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:38.125
Grandma.

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:41.583
A doping test will be made
as a result of the Turkish team's objection.

01:25:41.625 --> 01:25:43.000
Please, write it down.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.541
Where do I put this? Where?

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:50.250
-What is this?
-Pee, sir. Urine.

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:51.833
This is the cup you need to use.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.666
Yes, that's why I filled this up.

01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:56.333
I held it in the whole day.
Mine wouldn't fit in that cup.

01:25:56.375 --> 01:25:57.791
Sir, this is the official procedure.

01:25:57.833 --> 01:26:00.916
Oh, please. Take the lid off.
Take it off.

01:26:00.958 --> 01:26:03.791
Hold it. Here.
There you go, happy now?

01:26:03.833 --> 01:26:05.416
Take the cup and this as well.

01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:07.458
Take the extra, take it all.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.500
I have had enough of you people.

01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:14.500
What does it say?

01:26:18.833 --> 01:26:20.666
The result is negative.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.041
That's it!
Negative. That's it.

01:26:23.083 --> 01:26:25.791
-Do you see everything on there?
-No, we only check for the doping.

01:26:25.916 --> 01:26:28.541
People say I might have diabetes,
does it show up?

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.625
-No, sir.
-Any STDs?

01:26:30.666 --> 01:26:32.708
-No, sir.
-What about e. coli?

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:34.000
-No.
-Ebola?

01:26:34.041 --> 01:26:35.833
-No!
-Can you check if I have...

01:26:35.875 --> 01:26:37.750
-...hepatitis C?
-No, sir.

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:43.291
I had a suspicious intercourse
with a lady friend 17 years ago.

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:45.750
She passed away right after.

01:26:45.916 --> 01:26:47.083
I couldn't ask her.

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:49.708
That's why I've been going to
the medical centre once a week...

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.083
-...for 17 years for penicillin shots.
-Russian athlete, please.

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:54.041
Just look what will come up in his test.

01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:56.708
The machine will go crazy,
it will show everything.

01:26:57.083 --> 01:27:00.500
It's not like hitting someone
with a towel on his head, is it?

01:27:00.625 --> 01:27:02.833
You're better than that!

01:27:02.916 --> 01:27:04.416
I couldn't even see you!

01:27:04.458 --> 01:27:06.208
I couldn't!
What's up with that?

01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:08.541
I would punch you back if I could see.
Show off!

01:27:08.583 --> 01:27:10.250
I couldn't see you.

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:14.916
You'll see what's up now.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.750
You'll see.

01:27:17.708 --> 01:27:19.083
The result is positive.

01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:22.083
Yes, positive! He did doping!
He did it!

01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:23.416
That’s not true, I didn’t use it!

01:27:23.458 --> 01:27:24.708
-I didn’t!
-Calm down, calm down.

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:27.541
He did doping!
He has no honour!

01:27:27.666 --> 01:27:30.333
It's not possible.
There has been a mistake. I didn't take it!

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:33.083
Of course you did, idiot!
The machine doesn't lie!

01:27:33.125 --> 01:27:36.458
Mine came out negative,
why did yours come out positive?

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:40.208
The test shows that the Russian athlete
has used banned substance.

01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:42.916
The Russian athlete has been disqualified.

01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:45.291
The Turkish athlete wins the gold medal.

01:27:45.375 --> 01:27:47.041
Thank you, sir. Thanks.
Put it on.

01:27:47.083 --> 01:27:48.625
He tricked me!
He did this!

01:27:48.666 --> 01:27:52.541
What's up Nikolay?
I'll give you this and you'll cry.

01:27:53.875 --> 01:27:56.291
Hey! Stop it! Stop!

01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:58.458
We've got the medal. Stop!

01:27:58.833 --> 01:28:01.375
-The medal is ours. Come here.
-Get out!

01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:03.958
I couldn't see anything
when the towel was on my head.

01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:05.291
Then he punched me.

01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:07.083
That was a harsh one.

01:28:07.875 --> 01:28:09.166
Recep? I see you got a medal.

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.916
I got it alright but why did you
take him outside, Nurullah?

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:14.875
He has been crying nonstop
for a few hours.

01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:17.666
I pitied him
when he started crying like a baby.

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:19.750
I took him outside for some fresh air.

01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:22.333
-Did I do something wrong?
-Of course you did, Nurullah!

01:28:22.375 --> 01:28:25.500
You don't take a prisoner outside like this.
You should have at least gagged him.

01:28:25.541 --> 01:28:27.583
-What if he screams?
-No, I won't scream!

01:28:27.666 --> 01:28:29.875
-Zip it!
-Trust me, he can't scream.

01:28:29.916 --> 01:28:31.791
-Look, I've set something up.
-Set what up?

01:28:31.833 --> 01:28:34.125
That's right.
I brought the spare battery from the truck...

01:28:34.166 --> 01:28:36.375
...and connected
the electricity into his brain.

01:28:36.416 --> 01:28:38.416
Look, I've even put a button here.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.583
I press it when he starts screaming.

01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:42.250
You want to see it?

01:28:44.708 --> 01:28:47.541
Stop! Don't press it! Please!

01:28:47.708 --> 01:28:49.208
So it's connected to the brain?

01:28:49.333 --> 01:28:51.916
-That's right.
-You're an unbelievable human.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.208
-Alright then.
-Please, please. I'm really sorry.

01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:56.000
-Button it!
-Akif, do something.

01:28:56.083 --> 01:28:57.791
Button it!

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:01.500
You don't seem alright.
Let me take you to rehabilitation.

01:29:01.541 --> 01:29:03.541
-What is rehabilitation?
-Come on, just come.

01:29:03.583 --> 01:29:07.208
-Don't take me places that I don't know.
-Recep, please come.

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.083
In here.

01:29:09.125 --> 01:29:12.250
-What is this place?
-This is the rehabilitation centre where...

01:29:12.291 --> 01:29:14.041
...athletes come to heal faster.

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:17.125
This looks like a funny place.
I don't want to have any problems.

01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:18.791
You won't. Everybody uses this place.

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:20.750
Come here,
I'll put you into this oxygen tank.

01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:23.666
-What is this?
-It's an oxygen tank.

01:29:23.708 --> 01:29:27.958
When the oxygen level increases in your blood,
your recovery will speed up.

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:31.125
-So?
-You're exhausted. You need to recover.

01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:34.291
-You need to get into this.
-No, there's no way.

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:36.333
Let me tell you something.
I have claustrophobia.

01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:39.416
-There's no way I'm getting in this.
-But all the athletes use it.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:41.583
-You'll be fine.
-Find me another gadget.

01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:44.666
There are hundreds of gadgets here.
I can't get into this. Please.

01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:46.625
I'm here for you.
I'll open it if there is a problem.

01:29:46.666 --> 01:29:48.708
-Promise me.
-I will. I'll be right here.

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.583
-Sure?
-I will, I promise.

01:29:50.625 --> 01:29:52.958
-Hold my medal.
-OK.

01:29:53.416 --> 01:29:55.125
-Keep it safe.
-OK.

01:29:55.208 --> 01:29:56.375
Open it.

01:29:57.875 --> 01:30:00.875
-You'll open it when I say so.
-Yes, promise.

01:30:02.583 --> 01:30:04.458
-No, no. Open it!
-Hold on!

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.916
-No, open it!
-Just try it.

01:30:05.958 --> 01:30:07.416
-I'm not feeling well.
-Commencing.

01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:10.000
I'm getting claustrophobic.
Get me out!

01:30:10.041 --> 01:30:12.125
It's locked!
There is an air flow!

01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:13.750
-That's oxygen.
-The air flow?

01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:16.208
-Yes, it will make you feel better.
-That's oxygen?

01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:18.333
It will speed up your recovery.

01:30:18.416 --> 01:30:20.666
-It feels perfect.
-Doesn't it?

01:30:20.708 --> 01:30:22.916
-It's great.
-Haven't I told you?

01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:25.458
-This is nice.
-Would I ever do you harm?

01:30:25.541 --> 01:30:28.666
-Wait a little more, relax.
-This is nice. I'm getting high.

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:30.166
Excellent.

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:34.625
I would stay in this for years.

01:30:34.708 --> 01:30:36.291
-It's the perfect place.
-OK, that's enough.

01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:38.375
-I feel like laughing.
-Do you want to get out?

01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:40.500
-No, don't. It's OK.
-No, it's over.

01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:42.041
Let me stay just a little longer.

01:30:42.125 --> 01:30:43.791
OK, Recep, that's enough.

01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:47.333
-Now, to the cold chamber.
-I don't know about the cold chamber...

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.833
...but I would even go clubbing with you.

01:30:49.875 --> 01:30:51.458
We can't, we have a match. Come on.

01:30:51.541 --> 01:30:54.083
I'm as high as a kite.

01:30:54.833 --> 01:30:58.041
You kept saying cold chamber,
is this it?

01:30:58.083 --> 01:30:59.458
Yes, this is it.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.458
I see, it feels cold alright.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.916
Exactly. Now, you go in there
and stay for 45 minutes.

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:06.708
It will stimulate your muscles.

01:31:06.791 --> 01:31:09.166
Then the body recovers and
revitalized, right?

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:11.833
-Exactly. You'll feel great.
-OK, I get it.

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:13.958
-You'll wait here for me?
-Yes.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.166
-Don't.
-Why?

01:31:15.208 --> 01:31:16.958
You put me in there,
then just go.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.166
No way.
I have to be here.

01:31:18.208 --> 01:31:21.791
Do you want the team to be
without a leader while I'm in here?

01:31:21.875 --> 01:31:23.791
-Aren't you the leader's assistant?
-I am.

01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:25.916
I am putting you in charge temporarily.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.416
You will lead the team
while I'm in there.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:33.166
You set the machine up and leave.
I'll get out at 8:45, 40 minutes later.

01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:35.291
-Alright, then. See you.
-OK, set it up.

01:31:35.333 --> 01:31:37.125
-Alright.
-Here.

01:31:37.708 --> 01:31:39.916
-I am cold already.
-Of course.

01:31:39.958 --> 01:31:41.666
It feels cold.
Come on, close the door.

01:31:41.708 --> 01:31:43.708
Don't let it get out.

01:31:51.458 --> 01:31:53.458
God, it really is cold.

01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:56.750
I swear, I am starting to feel it.

01:31:57.166 --> 01:32:00.166
This idiot has said 45 minutes.
Wouldn't it be too much?

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:03.916
God. I feel it in my feet already.

01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:13.166
What? The power is off.

01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:17.375
God! Is the door locked?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.291
Who's closing the curtains.
Who are you?

01:32:20.333 --> 01:32:22.125
Akif, is that you?

01:32:22.166 --> 01:32:24.208
He looked like the Russian.
Who is that?

01:32:24.291 --> 01:32:26.125
They locked me in here!

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.125
Is this a joke! Hey! Dude!

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:33.083
It's locked alright!

01:32:33.125 --> 01:32:35.083
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:40.333
Now I'm feeling claustrophobic, as well.
I'm not feeling well.

01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:42.625
I really am not feeling well.

01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:50.666
Can I help you?

01:32:50.708 --> 01:32:52.791
Hello. I wanted to use it
but it seems it is out of order.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.375
What does it say here?
"Out of order."

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.125
-Maybe next time.
-OK, thank you.

01:33:11.625 --> 01:33:13.041
Recep?

01:33:16.708 --> 01:33:17.916
Recep?

01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:23.333
Are you ready for the big day?

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.500
I didn't want to risk it
so I come to take you personally.

01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:30.125
Where is this guy?

01:33:31.625 --> 01:33:33.250
Guys, has anyone seen Recep?

01:33:33.291 --> 01:33:35.708
No. We last saw him yesterday afternoon.
What's up?

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:38.958
-Did something happen to Recep?
-He has a wrestling match in an hour.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.458
I wanted to be safe
and went up to his room but he wasn't there.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.791
You were with him last, weren't you?

01:33:43.833 --> 01:33:46.208
Yes, I put him into the cold
chamber in the rehabilitation centre.

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:48.666
He was supposed to get out in 45 minutes.
He told me to leave.

01:33:48.708 --> 01:33:51.125
And you just left?
Are you stupid, or what?

01:33:51.166 --> 01:33:54.000
Take us to the place
where you last saw him yesterday.

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:57.166
Excuse me! Can you help us?

01:33:57.291 --> 01:33:59.208
How may I help you?

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:01.458
A friend of ours used this facility yesterday.
We can't find him.

01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:03.500
He was here at 20:00.
He must be in there.

01:34:03.541 --> 01:34:05.083
There's no way anybody is in there.

01:34:05.166 --> 01:34:07.875
-Can you open it? I want to check it out.
-Alright, let's have a look.

01:34:08.458 --> 01:34:10.750
Recep! Recep!
Are you there?

01:34:13.708 --> 01:34:16.125
I'm literally freezing my ass off.

01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:18.416
My ass off.

01:34:18.666 --> 01:34:20.583
Orhan, quickly!

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:22.291
-Slowly, Orhan.
-Slowly.

01:34:22.375 --> 01:34:24.041
-Hold him.
-Careful, I'll break.

01:34:24.083 --> 01:34:27.041
-Oh, Recep.
-I'm frozen, I'll break in half.

01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:29.375
Spin me!

01:34:29.583 --> 01:34:32.541
I'm melting, guys.
Good job.

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:34.416
How are you? Better?

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:37.708
Much better but my ass is on fire.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:40.333
Spin me!
Keep me spinning, you idiots!

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:42.375
Who did this to you?
Did you see?

01:34:42.416 --> 01:34:45.083
I couldn't exactly see
but I think it was the Russian.

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:47.875
I saw the Russian tracksuit
but I couldn't see who he was.

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:50.916
If you want, let's gather
all the Russians up.

01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:53.875
God. My ass is on fire!
Keep me spinning.

01:34:54.083 --> 01:34:56.166
Haven't I told you to keep me spinning.

01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:58.375
Of course we will gather them up, you idiot!

01:34:58.458 --> 01:34:59.583
But first, we need to wrestle.

01:34:59.625 --> 01:35:00.916
Keep spinning, come on!

01:35:00.958 --> 01:35:05.250
Should have put me up like doner
instead of lying me like kebab?

01:35:05.291 --> 01:35:06.875
My feet are still frozen.

01:35:06.916 --> 01:35:10.083
No that would burn your feet.
The fire is homogenous.

01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:12.375
My ass is on fire!

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:14.500
Can't you do multitasking?

01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:16.958
Can't you keep spinning
while talking, idiots?

01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:30.875
Steady!

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:32.875
-Would you like me to pour it now?
-Go ahead.

01:35:32.916 --> 01:35:34.916
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Getting oiled up.

01:35:36.083 --> 01:35:37.916
There is no oil in this competition.

01:35:37.958 --> 01:35:41.125
It's freestyle wrestling, not oil wrestling.
Get rid of it, please.

01:35:41.166 --> 01:35:43.958
He knows the rules better.
We should follow him, Adem.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.625
But let me be clear.
I won't get rid of drum and zurna.

01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:49.541
Those are my inspiration.
They fire me up.

01:35:49.666 --> 01:35:51.708
OK, then. Keep them.
Alright.

01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:55.583
Come on, guys. Make some noise!

01:36:04.708 --> 01:36:06.791
Good luck. Romania, isn't it?

01:36:06.875 --> 01:36:10.000
We love Romanians.
We are very close to Roman people.

01:36:10.125 --> 01:36:13.166
You have Tarik Mengüç and Kibariye.

01:36:13.375 --> 01:36:16.125
Late Adnan Senses...
He used to dance like this.

01:36:16.333 --> 01:36:17.375
Love them.

01:36:17.416 --> 01:36:19.125
There won't be any illegal moves.

01:36:19.208 --> 01:36:21.916
-Understood.
-Red to your place, blue to your place.

01:36:22.041 --> 01:36:24.500
To your starting positions.
Shake hands.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.125
Got it?

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:32.666
Go, Recep!

01:36:35.541 --> 01:36:37.541
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to pull him down.

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:40.291
You grab him by the neck like this
and pull him down.

01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:42.541
-It's a move in wrestling.
-I'll give you a warning next time.

01:36:49.208 --> 01:36:50.916
-What are you doing?
-Gripping.

01:36:50.958 --> 01:36:52.666
-There is no such move.
-What do you mean?

01:36:52.708 --> 01:36:54.708
-No!
-It's the gripping move.

01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:56.208
There is no such move.
It's illegal.

01:36:56.291 --> 01:36:59.541
How am I going to grip him
and throw him down?

01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:00.583
Do it another way.

01:37:00.625 --> 01:37:02.875
He's all round and curvy.
How am I supposed to grip him?

01:37:02.958 --> 01:37:05.625
Either by his ass or...
It's wrestling.

01:37:05.791 --> 01:37:07.791
Foul red. One point to blue.

01:37:08.791 --> 01:37:10.250
-Again?
-Again.

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:13.291
-Take the bottom position.
-What do you mean? I don't get it.

01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:14.916
Kneel down.

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:18.083
-Like this?
-And put your hands down.

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:20.000
-Like this?
-Exactly.

01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:21.958
Blue, top position.

01:37:22.333 --> 01:37:24.833
No way! Hold on!
Stop right there!

01:37:24.875 --> 01:37:28.375
You told me to kneel down and put my hands down
and I did what you told me to.

01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:31.750
But it's different
when you say he will be behind me.

01:37:31.833 --> 01:37:33.125
I am in my national jersey.

01:37:33.208 --> 01:37:35.958
You're making me bend over
saying it is the bottom position.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.291
That's the rule. Please.

01:37:37.375 --> 01:37:40.208
He's like an English Bulldog
and pit bull crossbred.

01:37:40.291 --> 01:37:42.416
How am I supposed to turn my back?

01:37:42.458 --> 01:37:44.000
Sir! Please follow the rules!

01:37:44.083 --> 01:37:47.208
Do you want us to get a room?

01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:49.500
Everyone would be happy then.

01:37:49.583 --> 01:37:51.916
-Please take your position.
-Good God!

01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:55.083
I'm doing this for my country.
I wouldn't do it for anything else.

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.708
Ref...

01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:05.500
Out! Neutral position!

01:38:05.541 --> 01:38:07.500
Go, Recep!

01:38:14.541 --> 01:38:15.666
I won!

01:38:15.708 --> 01:38:17.291
-What are you doing?
-I pinned him.

01:38:17.333 --> 01:38:19.291
-He's not your opponent.
-Who is this then?

01:38:19.333 --> 01:38:22.083
-He's the Bulgarian athlete.
-Dude, what are you doing on my side?

01:38:22.166 --> 01:38:24.541
Go back to your own side. Go!

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:26.083
Come on!

01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:29.041
Look at him! He's making himself pinned,
coming to my side.

01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:31.333
I pin everyone I see.

01:38:31.416 --> 01:38:35.041
-Blue, why did you leave the mat?
-Dude, why did you leave the mat?

01:38:35.125 --> 01:38:36.208
Get out if you're that scared!

01:38:36.291 --> 01:38:38.708
Say you're a little girl and can't compete,
then get out.

01:38:38.791 --> 01:38:40.916
Who is going to save you
if you keep switching mats?

01:38:40.958 --> 01:38:43.708
I'll choke you. Just wait.

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.458
Dude!

01:38:49.041 --> 01:38:50.791
I am going to puke.

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:53.666
What's that smell?
Wipe your ass.

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:56.750
He stepped on the mat with a dirty ass.
God damn you!

01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:58.791
Athletes are supposed to be clean.

01:38:58.875 --> 01:39:01.625
Did he poop in his pants or what?
It stinks.

01:39:08.291 --> 01:39:10.750
-That's it!
-You're the man!

01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:22.375
That's it! Yeah!
Turkish power!

01:39:39.083 --> 01:39:40.500
That's not fair!

01:39:40.583 --> 01:39:42.916
I can't see anything with this on my head.

01:39:42.958 --> 01:39:44.083
And you tied us with a rope.

01:39:44.125 --> 01:39:46.416
I can't escape.
I can't leave.

01:39:48.666 --> 01:39:51.791
God damn this sport!

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:06.916
Strokes! Like this!

01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:09.625
They're closing in. Touch it!

01:40:09.708 --> 01:40:12.625
That's it! We've won!
Good job.

01:40:12.666 --> 01:40:14.041
High five.

01:40:14.083 --> 01:40:15.958
High five! You got me all wet.

01:40:36.041 --> 01:40:38.166
Come on, girl! You go! Come on!

01:40:38.208 --> 01:40:40.250
Devour that German girl! Come on!

01:40:40.375 --> 01:40:42.208
Shut up! Just shut it!

01:40:43.125 --> 01:40:44.958
You'll make me lose.
Leave me alone!

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.833
Alright. Get up, get up.

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:48.208
That's OK.

01:40:49.833 --> 01:40:51.791
Throw her down.

01:40:55.083 --> 01:40:58.166
That's it! Well done, girl!
Good job!

01:40:58.208 --> 01:40:59.416
Yes!

01:40:59.791 --> 01:41:01.250
Cheer for her!

01:41:12.083 --> 01:41:13.875
-Oh my!
-Come on, Erdal.

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:16.708
-Come on, tiger!
-I'm scared. I can't jump.

01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:20.458
Just jump like you're jumping into a dam lake.
What do you mean you're scared?

01:41:20.625 --> 01:41:23.375
-OK, I will.
-Do a backflip.

01:41:23.416 --> 01:41:25.708
With your hip, with your shoulders.

01:41:26.083 --> 01:41:28.125
Come on! Show me what you got!

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:32.875
He did it! He did it very well!

01:42:03.833 --> 01:42:07.041
Dear friends, we've gathered here
on this nice summer evening.

01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:09.083
For God's sake!
What are we doing here?

01:42:09.125 --> 01:42:11.250
Let me tell you.
Do you know where they are from?

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:13.208
-Russia.
-What is their national game?

01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:16.375
Russian roulette.
Now with the Russian roulette technique...

01:42:16.416 --> 01:42:18.291
...I will reveal that slimy bastard...

01:42:18.333 --> 01:42:21.333
...who locked me in that cold chamber.

01:42:21.416 --> 01:42:23.625
Go ahead! Spin it!

01:42:24.291 --> 01:42:28.333
Let's see who the lucky one is.
Let me warm up.

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.166
Recep, please.
Someone will see us.

01:42:30.208 --> 01:42:32.166
Shut up! Don't drive me mad!

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:34.875
Nikolay.

01:42:34.916 --> 01:42:37.000
Let me smack you once before the questions.

01:42:37.041 --> 01:42:38.583
-OK, it was me.
-It was?

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:41.041
-Yes, it was.
-Why did you do it, Nikolay?

01:42:41.125 --> 01:42:43.541
Why lock a man in a cold chamber, Nikolay?

01:42:43.666 --> 01:42:46.041
We've found the culprit!

01:42:46.083 --> 01:42:49.041
I see it now.
I recognize the hair and everything.

01:42:49.083 --> 01:42:51.500
OK, guys, you take Nikolay...

01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:54.416
...and bring him to the poolside
for his punishment.

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.875
Guys, now I will punish Nikolay.

01:42:58.916 --> 01:43:00.666
Let me go!

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:02.041
We will.

01:43:02.083 --> 01:43:04.125
We'll let you go alright.
Don't worry.

01:43:04.208 --> 01:43:06.375
-Let's go.
-No! Stop!

01:43:06.458 --> 01:43:07.916
One...

01:43:08.291 --> 01:43:10.125
...two...

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:11.666
...three!

01:43:16.833 --> 01:43:19.958
What's up, Nikolay?
I'll give you this and you'll get dry.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.625
Have you felt your back burn?

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.291
High five. Come on.

01:43:35.041 --> 01:43:38.333
Welcome to the Eurasia Youth
Sports Games 2016 closing night.

01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:41.958
It is the men's 4x200 finals.

01:43:54.250 --> 01:43:56.041
Hello.

01:43:56.375 --> 01:43:58.041
Huddle up.

01:43:58.708 --> 01:44:00.375
Guys, it's the last day of the tournament.

01:44:00.458 --> 01:44:03.083
It's the last game.
It all comes down to this.

01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:06.583
We've overcome so many things.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.416
Remember all the turning points
of the tournament.

01:44:10.833 --> 01:44:14.041
We've stuck together with our heads high.

01:44:14.791 --> 01:44:16.791
Look, the kids are behind us.

01:44:17.083 --> 01:44:19.375
Bright kids. All national athletes.

01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:23.333
They all have dreams.
They all have worries.

01:44:23.541 --> 01:44:26.625
We'll compete for them
as well as our country and ourselves.

01:44:26.875 --> 01:44:28.666
And you know what we will do?

01:44:28.833 --> 01:44:32.250
We will win this race
for the flag on our chests...

01:44:32.375 --> 01:44:34.166
...with our sweat and blood!

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:35.958
-Where are you from?
-Sivas.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.041
-You?
-Kayseri.

01:44:37.083 --> 01:44:38.125
-You?
-Adana.

01:44:38.208 --> 01:44:39.541
-Sen?
-Edirne!

01:44:39.583 --> 01:44:42.250
And I'm from Kars.
On my grandfather's side, from Far East.

01:44:42.333 --> 01:44:44.333
From which country are these cities?

01:44:44.541 --> 01:44:48.000
From Turkey! What are we?
We're Turks!

01:44:48.333 --> 01:44:50.041
Then what do we do?

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:51.291
We win!

01:44:51.333 --> 01:44:52.708
-What do we do?
-We win.

01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:54.333
-What do we do?
-We win.

01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:55.958
Here, here.

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:58.125
Turkey!

01:44:58.166 --> 01:45:00.166
Come on!

01:45:10.583 --> 01:45:12.750
Come on, Orhan. Get ready!

01:45:12.833 --> 01:45:16.625
Run like the wind!
Let your hair dance in the wind!

01:45:16.708 --> 01:45:18.541
Come on, Hasan. Come on!

01:45:18.625 --> 01:45:21.750
Take that. Run, Orhan!
Jump, Orhan. Go!

01:45:21.833 --> 01:45:24.833
Sprint, Orhan! Like that!
Come on, Orhan!

01:45:24.916 --> 01:45:28.166
Pick it up! You can do this!

01:45:28.625 --> 01:45:32.666
God, I'm begging you.
Please, let us win this race.

01:45:32.916 --> 01:45:35.958
Go, go, go! Run, tiger, run!

01:45:36.041 --> 01:45:39.000
Go, Orhan! Go, Orhan!

01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:42.250
Adem, take it. Run! Nice!

01:45:42.333 --> 01:45:45.083
Very nice. That's my boy. Run!

01:45:45.166 --> 01:45:47.333
Step on it! Go on, run!

01:45:47.416 --> 01:45:49.750
Come, my boy! Hurry, Adem!
Come to your daddy!

01:45:49.875 --> 01:45:53.291
Here, my boy! Run, Adem, run!

01:45:53.416 --> 01:45:54.791
Run! Run!

01:45:54.875 --> 01:45:57.166
-Give it here!
-Here!

01:45:57.208 --> 01:45:58.791
-Dude!
-Here!

01:45:58.875 --> 01:46:01.166
-Pass it over, pass it over!
-Here!

01:46:01.208 --> 01:46:03.625
To my hand, to my hand.

01:46:03.666 --> 01:46:05.583
Not to my ass!

01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:46.416
-They finished together!
-I won!

01:46:46.541 --> 01:46:49.666
-I definitely won!
-Let's check the photo finish camera!

01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:51.958
-Yes, Recep!
-Good job!

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.583
You've won!

01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:55.166
There, there!

01:47:01.041 --> 01:47:02.666
The winner is Turkey!

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.083
God! This is it!

01:47:10.458 --> 01:47:13.333
This is it! Turkey wins!

01:47:13.416 --> 01:47:15.166
We've done it!

01:47:17.416 --> 01:47:19.166
It's time to cheer now!

01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:21.250
