01:12.883 --> 01:14.250
Time's running out, isn't it?

01:14.252 --> 01:15.985
We got nothing but time, asshole.

01:15.987 --> 01:18.287
Your boys think you're in here
with your bodyguard. Remember?

01:18.289 --> 01:19.622
Yeah?

01:19.624 --> 01:21.590
How you gonna get out of here, genius?

01:21.592 --> 01:23.659
You even think about that?

01:24.728 --> 01:26.562
Just like a couple of Geckos.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.797
Not only can you not see
the forest for the trees,

01:28.799 --> 01:31.000
you can't see the bear that's in the woods

01:31.002 --> 01:33.035
that just took a shit on your head.

01:33.037 --> 01:35.571
Stop being colorful. It's annoying.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.074
Come on! Quick!

01:39.076 --> 01:40.876
Well, how about I just smash this table

01:40.878 --> 01:43.279
right over your
melon-fucking-head for you?

01:43.281 --> 01:45.581
What did you say to me?

01:45.583 --> 01:47.983
I said you're a couple
of shit-for-brains!

01:47.985 --> 01:49.552
Okay. Come on.

01:49.554 --> 01:50.819
Hey! What are you doing?

01:51.621 --> 01:52.788
It's the labyrinth, man.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.290
Killing Boss Hogg might be the wrong move.

01:54.292 --> 01:55.724
Don't let it push your buttons.

01:56.961 --> 01:58.827
Well, maybe I'll let it show me the truth

01:58.829 --> 02:00.329
from inside your screwed-up head.

02:00.331 --> 02:01.664
What are you talking about?

02:01.666 --> 02:03.098
You killed dad.

02:04.568 --> 02:06.101
He didn't burn up on the couch.

02:06.103 --> 02:08.804
You doused him with lighter
fluid while he was drunk.

02:10.306 --> 02:11.106
Is it true?

02:12.108 --> 02:13.776
Is it?

02:13.778 --> 02:14.910
Yes.

02:17.614 --> 02:19.782
Now will you let me get back to work?

02:32.596 --> 02:33.696
Just get it open.

02:33.698 --> 02:35.731
You... Tell them you're fine.

02:40.804 --> 02:42.671
Hang back, boys! I'm good!

02:51.881 --> 02:54.083
Look at that.

02:54.085 --> 02:56.852
Even a blind squirrel finds
an occasional testicle,

02:56.854 --> 02:57.820
doesn't he?

02:57.822 --> 02:59.722
What do you know?

02:59.724 --> 03:02.625
The Gecko boys finally wrap their buckteeth

03:02.627 --> 03:04.860
around a nice, juicy nut sac.

03:50.707 --> 03:53.409
Wait a second.

03:53.411 --> 03:54.777
This has got to be it.

03:54.779 --> 03:56.011
It's got to be what?

03:56.013 --> 03:57.713
The end.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.983
This door handle, or
whatever the hell it is,

04:00.985 --> 04:04.920
is how we started this hall
of mirrors in the first place.

04:13.897 --> 04:15.731
You're right.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.466
We did it.

04:17.468 --> 04:19.935
We found the Sasak Ukib.

04:19.937 --> 04:21.236
What?

04:33.751 --> 04:35.918
Whoa, Richie.

04:38.154 --> 04:39.888
Richie, what are you doing?

04:43.793 --> 04:46.095
Jesus Christ, Richie! What are you...

04:56.207 --> 04:59.475
The serpent is filled with her blood.

04:59.477 --> 05:01.210
She's inside me now, Seth.

05:01.212 --> 05:03.045
It's all right.

05:03.047 --> 05:05.214
She prepared me for this.

05:05.216 --> 05:06.982
I knew that it was coming.

05:06.984 --> 05:08.484
Well, I didn't.

05:10.488 --> 05:12.087
That's our way to the top.

05:12.089 --> 05:14.656
You still got that $30
mill strapped to yourself?

05:15.125 --> 05:16.792
It's time to settle up.

05:18.128 --> 05:20.262
I don't know who you are anymore.

05:20.997 --> 05:22.231
I don't know what you are.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.299
I guess I'm just the guy who killed Dad.

06:09.584 --> 06:11.584
Scott.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.426
Scott.

06:25.532 --> 06:27.366
Listen to me.

06:27.368 --> 06:29.435
Scott, your sister's in danger.

06:30.570 --> 06:32.338
I can take care of this if you want me to.

06:33.341 --> 06:34.607
Go find my daughter.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.642
- You sure?
- Go.

06:41.782 --> 06:42.815
Scott.

06:42.817 --> 06:43.883
Oh, son.

06:45.385 --> 06:47.787
Yajawil ahk'Abe'.

06:47.789 --> 06:50.389
Uyuumil muuyile'.

06:50.391 --> 06:52.325
Hulen tahiin.

06:52.327 --> 06:54.593
Hulen niwichnal.

06:54.595 --> 07:01.400
Tk'un uch'ich' sujuy ixik.

07:01.402 --> 07:04.670
Carlos wanted you here for a reason.

07:05.740 --> 07:07.673
Your blood is so pure.

07:07.675 --> 07:10.409
It's gonna satisfy
the nine lords...

07:10.411 --> 07:13.079
At least for now, before they realize

07:13.081 --> 07:15.381
that their precious Santanico is gone.

07:16.851 --> 07:19.352
Oh, Katey-kakes...

07:19.354 --> 07:21.687
...You should be very proud.

07:21.689 --> 07:22.688
It's all you.

07:25.593 --> 07:27.460
I know why you got that name...

07:28.528 --> 07:30.429
Katey-kakes.

07:30.431 --> 07:34.767
Who wouldn't want to eat all that filling?

07:37.105 --> 07:39.505
Now we're gonna get to the good part!

07:39.507 --> 07:40.773
Rrrrrah!

07:46.113 --> 07:47.580
Welcome to the party sherrif.

07:51.652 --> 07:55.588
I knew it. That's why you didn't
get affected by the queen's bite.

07:55.590 --> 07:58.724
You're Otomi... Baddest of
the badass ancient warriors.

07:58.726 --> 08:01.560
I've read about you. Ha ha!

08:01.562 --> 08:04.730
You got a hell of a
bloodline there, compadre.

08:04.732 --> 08:07.133
It didn't help me find the serial
killer, you sneaky son of a bitch.

08:07.135 --> 08:08.634
It was you the whole time.

08:08.636 --> 08:10.436
Well, only one way to Carnegie Hall,

08:10.438 --> 08:13.139
and that's practice, practice...

08:13.141 --> 08:14.440
Practice!

08:20.181 --> 08:22.481
Touché, sheriff.

08:22.483 --> 08:23.749
I'm not a sheriff.

08:29.490 --> 08:31.457
Where's my dad?

08:31.459 --> 08:32.758
Did you find Scott?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.592
Yeah. Let's go.

08:36.663 --> 08:39.565
Don't give in to the
seduction of power, son.

08:41.501 --> 08:45.638
You may feel like you're greater
than Human, but you're not.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.839
This isn't you.

08:48.508 --> 08:49.775
But it is.

08:49.777 --> 08:52.578
And I just saved your life.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.480
Scott, something evil and
vicious has taken hold of you.

08:54.482 --> 08:55.915
Stop.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.917
You're gonna have to feed
on innocent blood to survive.

08:57.919 --> 08:59.785
You won't be able to live with yourself.

08:59.787 --> 09:01.487
Stop being a goddamn pastor!

09:03.924 --> 09:05.724
I never really was a part of this family!

09:06.793 --> 09:08.828
Was I?!

09:08.830 --> 09:10.930
You're a child of God.

09:10.932 --> 09:13.466
And I want you to find peace in Heaven.

09:13.468 --> 09:16.469
But you can't... You won't...
Not if you've killed so many.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.006
Goodbye, son.

09:30.584 --> 09:31.784
I'm sorry.

09:36.591 --> 09:38.724
Don't be sorry.

09:38.726 --> 09:41.961
We came here to be a family again.

09:41.963 --> 09:43.829
We still can be.

09:51.271 --> 09:52.271
Aah! Oh, God!

09:59.280 --> 10:01.247
You think you can slaughter the counselors

10:01.249 --> 10:02.715
and the lords will stand for it?

10:02.717 --> 10:04.550
By the time I'm finished with them,

10:04.552 --> 10:05.885
they won't be standing at all.

10:05.887 --> 10:07.253
Oh, yeah. That's right.

10:07.255 --> 10:08.754
You're gonna start the revolution.

10:08.756 --> 10:10.523
Why don't you write a song about it?

10:10.525 --> 10:12.658
Wrap a snake around your tits and dance.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.759
That's all you're good for.

10:13.761 --> 10:15.661
Enough! Both of you.

10:15.663 --> 10:17.930
What's with all the shouting?

10:18.632 --> 10:21.567
What's this all about?

10:21.569 --> 10:24.069
Narciso's a stand-up guy.
He saved my ass once.

10:24.905 --> 10:27.573
You, on the other hand...

10:27.575 --> 10:29.875
Welcome to the Twister.

10:29.877 --> 10:32.611
Can I get you anything?

10:32.613 --> 10:34.880
You know what I want?

10:34.882 --> 10:36.815
I want a gold medal.

10:36.817 --> 10:38.617
I want a podium.

10:38.619 --> 10:40.786
I want to hear the national anthem playing

10:40.788 --> 10:42.821
while the goddamn blue
angels fly over my head,

10:42.823 --> 10:44.790
and then I think I want
to be on some cereal boxes,

10:44.792 --> 10:47.059
because in case you
haven't noticed, Carlito,

10:47.061 --> 10:48.794
we just pulled off a job

10:48.796 --> 10:51.030
that had an extremely
high level of difficulty.

10:51.032 --> 10:51.964
Richard...

10:51.966 --> 10:54.667
Yeah. I got it.

10:54.669 --> 10:56.669
Oh-oh-oh-oh. Mi diosa.

11:00.307 --> 11:02.641
You're forgetting about something.

11:02.643 --> 11:04.009
The money.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.714
Where is it?

11:08.716 --> 11:10.716
The bonds are in a safe place.

11:10.718 --> 11:12.985
That's exactly where they're gonna stay.

11:12.987 --> 11:14.320
I'm sorry. ¿Qué?

11:14.322 --> 11:16.021
What are you talking about, Seth?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.923
I'm talking about my take, Richard,

11:17.925 --> 11:19.325
for this whole miserable job.

11:19.327 --> 11:20.826
Two jobs, actually...

11:20.828 --> 11:22.828
The bank robbery that nearly got me killed

11:22.830 --> 11:24.363
and your little imaginary heist

11:24.365 --> 11:25.931
that nearly got me buried... Literally.

11:25.933 --> 11:27.800
So you're just gonna take my money, too?

11:27.802 --> 11:29.602
Well, what do you care? You
already got what you wanted, right?

11:29.604 --> 11:31.337
Slithering around in your gullet.

11:31.339 --> 11:33.806
So why don't you go do whatever the
hell it is you're gonna do, okay?

11:33.808 --> 11:35.107
This is where I get off.

11:35.109 --> 11:37.910
Your brother and I need that money.

11:37.912 --> 11:39.678
My brother?

11:39.680 --> 11:41.814
Think my brother's gonna
be just fine without it.

11:41.816 --> 11:43.682
Well, I won't be.

11:43.684 --> 11:45.951
Well, you're gonna do whatever
your boss tells you to do.

11:45.953 --> 11:47.953
'Cause that's exactly
what she is, right...

11:47.955 --> 11:49.054
You little bitch?

11:49.056 --> 11:50.756
She's your boss, not mine.

11:50.758 --> 11:52.958
No, Seth.

12:05.639 --> 12:06.939
I'm moving up in the world.

12:17.183 --> 12:19.183
Carlos was right.

12:19.185 --> 12:22.353
When you bite someone, it's like...

12:22.355 --> 12:26.190
It's like you can feel their
life run right through you.

12:26.192 --> 12:30.394
It's because blood is
the conduit of the soul.

12:30.396 --> 12:32.429
It's what makes us Human.

12:33.398 --> 12:35.599
I saw it.

12:35.601 --> 12:38.202
Mom was sick.

12:38.204 --> 12:41.305
She needed help, and you just
left it all in God's hands.

12:41.307 --> 12:43.574
Your mother made her choice.

12:43.576 --> 12:46.710
What she did, she did to herself.

12:46.712 --> 12:48.612
No, it was your fault.

12:48.614 --> 12:50.648
You killed her.

12:50.650 --> 12:51.916
You killed her!

12:51.918 --> 12:52.616
No!

12:52.618 --> 12:54.451
He didn't, Scott.

12:56.488 --> 12:57.922
I know the truth.

12:57.924 --> 13:01.325
He suffered all alone for us, Scott.

13:01.327 --> 13:03.460
Like he always does.

13:13.205 --> 13:14.338
Scott, what did you do?

13:15.540 --> 13:17.208
Come on, dad.

13:17.210 --> 13:20.211
Come on, pastor.
Let's get you on your feet.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.445
Katey, listen
to me...

13:21.447 --> 13:23.347
No, Daddy, stop. You're hurt.

13:23.349 --> 13:24.548
We got to keep moving.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.417
- Come on.
- Keep moving?

13:26.419 --> 13:28.252
Where do you want to go? You
want to go back to Bethel?

13:28.254 --> 13:32.389
We came here to find a new
path, and look... We found it.

13:32.391 --> 13:34.992
Here it is! This is it!

13:34.994 --> 13:36.760
What is, Scott?

13:38.563 --> 13:42.333
You gonna turn us all into monsters?

13:42.335 --> 13:43.968
Are you gonna turn me into a monster?

13:43.970 --> 13:45.436
Is that what you're gonna do?

13:45.438 --> 13:47.705
You gonna turn me into
a monster, like you?!

13:47.707 --> 13:49.373
- Kate!
- Your plan?!

13:49.375 --> 13:50.307
Kate, don't!

13:50.309 --> 13:52.576
No. Right.

13:52.578 --> 13:53.744
No, I get it. I get it.

13:53.746 --> 13:55.346
- Scott, no.
- No, it's fine.

13:55.981 --> 13:57.748
You guys deserve each other.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.288
Katey, you listen to me...

14:04.290 --> 14:05.289
No. No.

14:05.291 --> 14:06.490
I won't let him near us.

14:06.492 --> 14:09.560
If he's gonna survive, he needs you.

14:11.296 --> 14:12.496
You need each other.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.799
And what about you?

14:18.603 --> 14:19.737
Your brother's right.

14:19.739 --> 14:23.307
You can't go back to Bethel.

14:23.309 --> 14:25.809
And I don't think your
dad can go back, either.

14:30.315 --> 14:32.283
You know how this has to end.

14:32.285 --> 14:33.484
No.

14:34.619 --> 14:37.421
We're gonna keep moving, okay?

14:39.524 --> 14:41.625
Well, I guess Uncle Eddie was right.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.027
Assholes do have friends.

14:43.029 --> 14:44.495
I thought you were leaving.

14:44.497 --> 14:46.297
It's one thing to ditch your brother,

14:46.299 --> 14:48.532
another to leave him
outnumbered in a fight.

14:48.534 --> 14:51.602
You don't really expect
to walk out of here?

14:51.604 --> 14:53.771
I'm sorry... Were
you not here earlier?

14:53.773 --> 14:56.407
It was a goddamn bloodsucker rave,

14:56.409 --> 14:57.775
and I'm still standing.

14:57.777 --> 14:59.476
So I'm warning
you, slick...

14:59.478 --> 15:01.578
You better find another
way to make some cash,

15:01.580 --> 15:03.347
'cause today ain't your payday.

15:03.349 --> 15:04.581
Tell us where the bonds are.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.450
Let's finish this without bloodshed.

15:06.452 --> 15:08.085
You kill me, you're never gonna find out.

15:08.087 --> 15:10.087
You're jealous, Carlos,

15:10.089 --> 15:13.324
so you make a deal with my captors?

15:13.825 --> 15:15.592
Don't be so angry, mi amor.

15:17.662 --> 15:19.463
Get away from me.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.802
"Find their Gods...

15:24.804 --> 15:27.638
And you'll find their gold."

15:27.640 --> 15:29.506
That's what I believed.

15:29.508 --> 15:32.876
I know it was bullshit, a fairy tale,

15:32.878 --> 15:35.479
because I had found something better,

15:35.481 --> 15:37.614
something deeper...

15:37.616 --> 15:39.783
Something stronger.

15:43.421 --> 15:44.655
I had found love.

15:49.094 --> 15:50.928
I never stopped loving you.

15:51.830 --> 15:54.398
Do not lie to me!

15:54.400 --> 15:57.501
I could never hate you as
much as you hate yourself.

15:57.503 --> 15:58.836
I did everything for you.

15:58.838 --> 16:02.439
I slaughtered my own
men, I betrayed my God.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.440
And for what?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.477
So you can go to bed with
this pinche criminal?!

16:10.615 --> 16:12.583
Unh!

16:14.586 --> 16:15.919
The venom will cripple him.

16:18.123 --> 16:19.923
But it will keep what's inside of him alive

16:19.925 --> 16:22.126
until I decide to set you free.

16:22.128 --> 16:24.661
Perhaps I'll make you my slave now.

16:27.932 --> 16:29.700
Who you calling a criminal, asshole?

16:32.437 --> 16:34.138
You still think I'm a slave.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.740
In here, I'm the queen!

16:49.978 --> 16:51.478
_

17:02.126 --> 17:03.126
_

17:29.627 --> 17:30.592
Yep. That'll work.

17:34.497 --> 17:36.365
It's all your fault.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.300
Excuse me, my fault?

17:39.570 --> 17:42.671
Yeah, that... That's rich.

17:42.673 --> 17:44.606
That's just... That's just beautiful.

17:44.608 --> 17:46.508
You wanted to leave with all the money.

17:46.510 --> 17:48.911
Yes. I did. You know why?

17:48.913 --> 17:50.646
Because it's my money. I stole it.

17:50.648 --> 17:52.247
You're so caught up in your own greed,

17:52.249 --> 17:53.415
you can't even see what just happened.

17:53.417 --> 17:55.284
Mm.

17:55.286 --> 17:56.952
Oh, trust me... I saw.

17:56.954 --> 17:59.321
Richie already told me
all about you and Carlito.

17:59.323 --> 18:00.923
What is it... Five centuries now?

18:00.925 --> 18:02.591
That's a long time to put up with your ass.

18:02.593 --> 18:04.193
He double-crossed me

18:04.195 --> 18:06.228
with the same monsters
who imprisoned me here.

18:06.230 --> 18:08.630
What would Seth Gecko do if
he got betrayed like this?

18:08.632 --> 18:10.299
It already happened.

18:10.301 --> 18:11.934
You turned my brother into a goddamn slave.

18:11.936 --> 18:12.935
He's not a slave!

18:12.937 --> 18:14.369
How can I imprison someone

18:14.371 --> 18:16.238
when I've been in chains my whole life?

18:16.240 --> 18:18.440
- Oh, right... You're the victim.
- I'm no one's victim.

18:20.243 --> 18:22.344
Carlos is gonna call you.
He's gonna offer you a deal.

18:22.346 --> 18:24.746
I want my freedom.

18:24.748 --> 18:26.481
That much, I deserve.

18:26.483 --> 18:28.717
Well, you don't have the money yet, do you?

18:28.719 --> 18:30.419
So I don't think you're going anywhere.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.410
_

18:35.435 --> 18:37.035
_

18:37.060 --> 18:38.560
_

18:38.585 --> 18:40.585
_

18:41.988 --> 18:43.788
_

18:43.813 --> 18:48.313
_

18:48.404 --> 18:49.571
I am your best earner.

18:49.573 --> 18:51.473
Who else, Narciso,

18:51.475 --> 18:55.344
has so consistently
provided for the nine houses?

18:55.346 --> 18:56.678
Hmm?

18:57.714 --> 19:01.316
I have always provided for them.

19:01.318 --> 19:03.285
But now...

19:03.287 --> 19:06.021
Now you are the one they will look to.

19:06.023 --> 19:08.423
You are going to tell them

19:08.425 --> 19:10.525
that Santanico was the
one that betrayed us.

19:11.561 --> 19:15.731
You are going bring them
the $30 million prize.

19:15.733 --> 19:17.599
Seth thinks it's just about the money,

19:17.601 --> 19:21.403
but those oil bonds are
the key to so much more.

19:21.405 --> 19:23.005
Narciso...

19:23.007 --> 19:26.708
Are you really going to
let that opportunity go by?

19:26.710 --> 19:28.810
I can walk right out that
door with the $30 mill,

19:28.812 --> 19:30.312
and you can't even follow me.

19:30.314 --> 19:31.280
You wouldn't.

19:31.282 --> 19:32.414
- Oh, no?
- No.

19:32.416 --> 19:34.750
You wouldn't do that to Richard.

19:35.818 --> 19:38.587
I know what he did to your father, Seth.

19:40.590 --> 19:42.591
Didn't that free you from your prison?

19:42.593 --> 19:45.360
You listen to me very
carefully, you psycho.

19:45.362 --> 19:48.563
My old man was a son of a
bitch and a world-class prick,

19:48.565 --> 19:50.532
but he didn't deserve to die.

19:50.534 --> 19:52.301
I need your brother, Seth.

19:52.802 --> 19:55.037
I can't bring down the
nine lords without him.

19:55.039 --> 19:56.772
I don't care about your stupid crusade.

19:56.774 --> 19:59.041
Oh, but you will. Trust me.

19:59.043 --> 20:00.809
The nine houses may live
in the shadows, Seth,

20:00.811 --> 20:03.045
but they have great power in this realm.

20:03.047 --> 20:06.048
They have more wealth
than you can even imagine.

20:06.050 --> 20:07.449
I already got what I need.

20:07.451 --> 20:08.784
It's never enough.

20:10.354 --> 20:11.787
You don't love the money.

20:11.789 --> 20:13.922
You love stealing it.

20:15.525 --> 20:17.859
It's about winning. Isn't it?

20:19.462 --> 20:20.762
So, when Carlos calls...

20:22.065 --> 20:24.366
Are you really gonna let him win?

20:26.469 --> 20:30.372
Richard killed your father for a reason.

20:30.374 --> 20:31.573
Forgive him.

20:31.575 --> 20:33.075
Well, why don't you forgive

20:33.077 --> 20:34.876
whoever threw you in this hole, sweetheart?

20:49.493 --> 20:51.727
Well, this is a nice change.

20:51.729 --> 20:54.229
I spend all day chasing you
down. Now you're calling me.

20:54.231 --> 20:55.664
Yeah. What do you know?

20:55.666 --> 20:57.366
The offer still stands...

20:57.368 --> 20:59.434
Your brother's life and that bitch's future

20:59.436 --> 21:01.503
for 100% of the take.

21:01.505 --> 21:02.637
You got 10 minutes, Seth.

21:02.639 --> 21:03.839
Then after that,

21:03.841 --> 21:05.440
it's one finger for each minute.

21:05.442 --> 21:06.875
And then, after that,

21:06.877 --> 21:08.910
it's one stake through his heart.

21:13.116 --> 21:15.617
Did you hear me, Seth?

21:15.619 --> 21:16.651
I'm in.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.559
There's all kinds of
markings on these walls.

21:24.561 --> 21:26.862
If this is where those things get made,

21:26.864 --> 21:29.131
maybe they can get unmade.

21:29.133 --> 21:30.399
You really can see it.

21:30.401 --> 21:31.733
See what?

21:31.735 --> 21:33.435
Our life... The future.

21:33.437 --> 21:36.505
You really can see us being happy again.

21:36.507 --> 21:39.908
I believe it's possible.

21:39.910 --> 21:41.176
Come on.

21:41.178 --> 21:42.744
You believe.

21:42.746 --> 21:45.981
That's the trick, isn't it?

21:50.820 --> 21:52.521
What are you doing? We can't stop.

21:52.523 --> 21:53.789
- I'm sorry, Katey-kakes.
- Come on, come on, come on.

21:53.791 --> 21:55.791
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to test your faith.

21:57.593 --> 21:58.994
I might even destroy it.

22:01.497 --> 22:05.667
This whole future that you see...

22:06.736 --> 22:08.470
It cannot be.

22:08.472 --> 22:09.805
No. No!

22:09.807 --> 22:11.506
No, I...

22:11.508 --> 22:12.674
Tell her, Ranger.

22:12.676 --> 22:13.909
Daddy, you get up! Get up now!

22:13.911 --> 22:16.812
Ranger Gonzalez, help me. Help...

22:16.814 --> 22:18.647
Dad! Get up! Get up now!

22:18.649 --> 22:20.982
Get up. Help me, please.

22:22.218 --> 22:25.187
Kate, all I can tell you is
what I've learned on the job.

22:25.189 --> 22:26.788
Oh, no.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.857
Day in and day out,

22:28.859 --> 22:31.660
people like you, the victim...

22:31.662 --> 22:33.862
There's one thing that's
really important to them.

22:35.598 --> 22:36.798
Closure.

22:40.970 --> 22:44.840
You don't want to see me
turn into a demon from hell.

22:44.842 --> 22:46.875
And I don't want to be one.

22:46.877 --> 22:49.678
I won't do it.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.613
You have to.

22:53.716 --> 22:56.618
I'm not gonna learn how to survive with it.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.220
Scott's young.

22:58.222 --> 22:59.955
He's not set in his ways.

22:59.957 --> 23:02.824
But I cannot abide killing
another human being.

23:02.826 --> 23:05.760
Now you're just being selfish!

23:05.762 --> 23:07.496
You're so selfish.

23:07.498 --> 23:11.666
You just want to go to Heaven
so you can be with Mama.

23:14.872 --> 23:17.572
I'm not so sure she's gonna be there.

23:19.576 --> 23:21.810
Your mama...

23:23.012 --> 23:24.646
She tried to kill herself.

23:24.648 --> 23:27.015
In the eyes of the Lord, that's a sin.

23:31.254 --> 23:33.588
Oh, God.

23:33.590 --> 23:36.591
You can't believe in a...

23:36.593 --> 23:38.727
In a God that would be that cruel.

23:38.729 --> 23:41.730
God, you can't believe that.

23:43.266 --> 23:45.634
He doesn't live on the pages of some book.

23:45.636 --> 23:47.002
Now, you hold on a second.

23:47.004 --> 23:48.703
No, he doesn't.

23:50.306 --> 23:54.375
He's inside each and every one of us.

24:00.883 --> 24:04.686
This whole trip's been about...

24:04.688 --> 24:06.821
Trying to find him.

24:11.093 --> 24:12.761
Who knew I'd find him

24:12.763 --> 24:16.097
in the walls of this... Pagan temple...

24:20.036 --> 24:22.671
And in my baby girl's eyes?

24:29.879 --> 24:31.713
Thank you.

24:36.352 --> 24:38.853
Send me home.

24:50.666 --> 24:51.833
You don't have to do this.

24:58.642 --> 25:00.709
Yes, I do.

25:16.826 --> 25:19.794
I love you, Katey-kakes.

25:19.796 --> 25:21.696
I love you.

25:21.698 --> 25:22.897
Daddy.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.768
I love you, too.

25:49.357 --> 25:51.291
Technically, it's only $26 million,

25:51.293 --> 25:54.194
but Carlos doesn't need to know that.

25:54.196 --> 25:56.229
Are you certain about using the real thing?

25:56.231 --> 25:59.299
Trust me... First thing
Carlito's gonna do is check.

25:59.301 --> 26:00.901
The plan's gonna work.

26:00.903 --> 26:02.903
You just got to make sure
your girls know what to do.

26:02.905 --> 26:04.171
They will.

26:11.646 --> 26:13.313
Do you think it's possible

26:13.315 --> 26:15.182
for someone to change their fate?

26:16.384 --> 26:18.418
I think you're well on your way, sister.

26:18.420 --> 26:20.320
I mean, anybody crosses you,

26:20.322 --> 26:21.922
you can rip their guts out
with your bare hands, right?

26:21.924 --> 26:23.423
Then eat them.

26:26.427 --> 26:29.329
That's how the world has always seen us...

26:29.331 --> 26:31.431
Something that must be hidden...

26:31.433 --> 26:33.800
Buried.

26:34.313 --> 26:36.813
_

26:37.939 --> 26:39.673
It's our fate to live in the shadows.

26:39.675 --> 26:42.976
Well, maybe you ought to stop
destroying people's lives.

26:42.978 --> 26:44.578
I do what I do to survive.

26:46.948 --> 26:48.682
Seth.

26:48.684 --> 26:49.950
I was wrong about you.

26:49.952 --> 26:51.484
Save it, okay?

26:51.486 --> 26:53.386
Not gonna work on this Gecko.

26:55.423 --> 26:59.960
You saved him from a lifetime of agony.

26:59.962 --> 27:02.696
He's at peace with Mama.
That's what he wanted.

27:06.701 --> 27:08.501
Maybe that's what God wanted.

27:08.503 --> 27:11.705
I've had this feeling all day.

27:11.707 --> 27:14.474
Felt like that since the
liquor store this morning.

27:14.476 --> 27:16.276
Like...

27:16.278 --> 27:19.646
Somebody's been leading me down a path.

27:21.983 --> 27:23.717
Carlos spelled it out for me.

27:23.719 --> 27:28.588
Said I was part of a war
that I can never escape...

27:28.590 --> 27:31.258
That I'd pay the price...

27:32.426 --> 27:35.028
That I'd lose my wife and daughter.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.429
And you'd believe that man

27:36.431 --> 27:37.664
before you believe your own heart?

27:39.600 --> 27:42.302
I hope my Billy grows up to be like you.

27:43.771 --> 27:45.739
Now let's get out of here.

27:45.741 --> 27:47.574
Come on.
Let's go...

27:51.545 --> 27:53.613
Kate?

27:53.615 --> 27:54.681
Kate?

28:21.709 --> 28:23.843
Relax. I'm almost done.

28:25.046 --> 28:27.647
Who are you?

28:27.649 --> 28:29.082
Are you being held in here?

28:29.084 --> 28:30.583
Not anymore.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.485
Six months of rehab, and I'm back on track.

28:32.487 --> 28:34.554
As long as I don't have to eat
their Mac 'n' Cheese anymore,

28:34.556 --> 28:36.056
I'm good.

28:36.058 --> 28:37.457
Who are you?

28:38.492 --> 28:40.460
Just a number.

28:40.462 --> 28:42.395
The system took me in

28:42.397 --> 28:43.730
when my mom fell so far off the wagon,

28:43.732 --> 28:45.465
she fell 6 feet under.

28:45.467 --> 28:49.069
It's all right now, though.
I've got it all figured out.

28:49.071 --> 28:50.637
Got what figured out?

28:50.639 --> 28:54.374
Exactly where to go with my life from here.

28:54.376 --> 28:57.944
I'm not gonna let my daddy's
ghost haunt me anymore.

29:25.106 --> 29:27.507
Where did you get this?

29:28.576 --> 29:29.843
My daddy walked out

29:29.845 --> 29:31.845
the day before I was
supposed to be baptized.

29:31.847 --> 29:33.747
And my mom was so screwed up by it,

29:33.749 --> 29:37.117
she never got around to doing it.

29:37.119 --> 29:40.887
So today, I'm finally being baptized.

29:44.525 --> 29:45.792
Billy?

29:47.828 --> 29:49.896
You made your choice, Papi.

29:57.805 --> 29:59.706
You all right?

30:01.742 --> 30:03.810
Something happened.

30:05.513 --> 30:07.914
Yeah, this place will do that to you.

30:13.187 --> 30:16.689
I don't know about you, but I'm famished.

30:21.762 --> 30:24.564
You know, Narciso has a
cook with him at all times.

30:24.566 --> 30:25.865
You believe that shit?

30:25.867 --> 30:27.934
El pinche flaco doesn't put on weight.

30:27.936 --> 30:30.036
Metabolism.

30:37.445 --> 30:38.912
You don't look so good.

30:38.914 --> 30:41.548
You're hungry, aren't you?

30:41.550 --> 30:42.916
I fed in the labyrinth.

30:42.918 --> 30:46.553
Yeah, you imagined
feeding in the labyrinth.

30:47.688 --> 30:49.689
I'll bet you're, uh...

30:49.691 --> 30:52.759
You're real good at, uh... Imagination.

30:55.663 --> 30:57.797
Your hunger will grow, Richard.

30:57.799 --> 31:00.934
And now that you're the prince,

31:00.936 --> 31:03.670
you got to stay in shape, bro.

31:03.672 --> 31:07.507
Because trust me...
She will tire of you,

31:07.509 --> 31:10.210
even if it takes five centuries.

31:10.212 --> 31:12.645
You got dumped, bro.

31:13.514 --> 31:14.814
Get over it.

31:14.816 --> 31:19.018
You know, I provided many
services to the lords.

31:21.523 --> 31:23.623
Among them...

31:26.350 --> 31:28.728
Catering.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.716
Feast.

31:56.762 --> 31:57.762
_

32:14.974 --> 32:16.174
Okay, okay.

32:16.176 --> 32:18.477
You guys look like you're about to get into

32:18.479 --> 32:20.078
an underwear-only pillow fight.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.080
Carlito, I got to tell you,

32:22.082 --> 32:24.783
the sun cannot come up
fast enough on this day.

32:24.785 --> 32:26.952
Oh, you don't want to see the
sun come up on your brother.

32:26.954 --> 32:28.754
As long as he stops
screwing this up, maybe.

32:28.756 --> 32:30.489
You know, it's funny
this whole thing

32:30.491 --> 32:32.758
kind of reminds me of
this job that we pulled

32:32.760 --> 32:34.760
about seven years ago in Cheyenne.

32:34.762 --> 32:37.295
Yeah, it didn't just go sideways.
It went three ways.

32:37.297 --> 32:39.765
We pulled it off, though,
didn't we, brother?

32:40.800 --> 32:42.234
You remember Cheyenne, don't you?

32:42.236 --> 32:44.970
I don't give a shit
about your past glories.

32:44.972 --> 32:46.938
Let's get this over with.

32:46.940 --> 32:49.107
- Soon as you uncuff him, we'll talk.
- Let's see it.

32:49.109 --> 32:51.009
Don't go near him, Carlos.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.010
Excuse me?

32:52.012 --> 32:53.545
He's gonna get me killed.

32:53.547 --> 32:55.514
He's gonna try something
like Phoenix six years ago.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.182
That one was so crazy, you
don't even want to know about it.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.851
- It wasn't as crazy as Cheyenne.
- Forget about Cheyenne!

32:59.853 --> 33:01.186
Enough!

33:02.255 --> 33:03.522
Where are the bearer bonds?

33:09.797 --> 33:11.196
I can't believe you sold us out

33:11.198 --> 33:12.998
to get in bed with these freaks.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.900
Not my fault you can't see
the big picture, brother.

33:14.902 --> 33:16.902
Trust me... I'm learning, fast!

33:16.904 --> 33:18.303
You don't learn. You can't learn.

33:18.305 --> 33:19.905
You're never gonna be more
than a small-time hood,

33:19.907 --> 33:21.439
- just like dad.
- Gentlemen, please!

33:21.441 --> 33:22.874
Let him go. I'll hand it over.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.342
What the hell do you care about
dad, anyway, you little shit?

33:24.344 --> 33:25.310
You killed him!

33:25.312 --> 33:26.845
He beat you on the daily,

33:26.847 --> 33:28.146
and you give him a pass and not me?

33:28.148 --> 33:30.148
- He's blood.
- You asshole!

34:06.987 --> 34:08.853
Oh, shit.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.159
Hey, look...

34:16.596 --> 34:18.163
Whoa.

34:24.036 --> 34:25.871
Forget it!

34:26.405 --> 34:27.371
My money!

34:50.897 --> 34:52.630
Richard. You're safe.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.899
They didn't know what hit 'em.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.132
Yeah, I know the feeling.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.668
Oh, relax. You're not gonna turn.

34:56.670 --> 34:58.036
I didn't pump any venom into you.

34:58.038 --> 35:00.372
Look, I had a plan, Richard... Cheyenne?

35:00.374 --> 35:02.140
Why couldn't you just trust me?

35:02.142 --> 35:03.441
Because in Cheyenne, we had an argument.

35:03.443 --> 35:05.243
It needed to be more than that.

35:05.245 --> 35:07.379
In Phoenix, we let the pricks
think that I killed you.

35:07.381 --> 35:10.181
Well, in Phoenix, you weren't
a goddamn succubus, were you?

35:10.183 --> 35:11.349
You taste like shit, by the way.

35:11.351 --> 35:13.118
Boys, it's time.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.452
Aah!

35:14.454 --> 35:16.321
Back up!

35:19.125 --> 35:21.092
Told you it was gonna be a long day.

35:24.629 --> 35:27.531
You're gonna pay for the trail
of bodies you left behind today,

35:27.533 --> 35:28.766
going all the way back to Earl.

35:28.768 --> 35:32.168
Step back! Or I'll put this
stake through his goddamn heart.

35:33.638 --> 35:34.504
Kill him.

35:34.506 --> 35:35.939
What are you, nuts?!

35:35.941 --> 35:38.675
Why are you hesitating,
rinche, hmm? Kill him.

35:38.677 --> 35:40.710
That's what your bloodline
is begging you to do,

35:40.712 --> 35:41.711
and yet you can't do it.

35:41.713 --> 35:42.846
Why?

35:42.848 --> 35:44.514
Maybe he doesn't have the stones.

35:44.516 --> 35:47.918
Maybe you just don't want
to pay the price, do you?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.853
You want to save your
family from what's coming?

35:49.855 --> 35:52.489
Margaret? Billy?

35:53.591 --> 35:55.192
You're making a big mistake, Ranger.

36:03.534 --> 36:04.968
All right.

36:04.970 --> 36:07.604
This is what's gonna happen.

36:07.606 --> 36:10.707
I'm gonna drop this stake,
and I'm gonna walk out of here.

36:10.709 --> 36:12.209
And none of you freaks

36:12.211 --> 36:14.711
better come after me
or my family... Ever...

36:14.713 --> 36:17.714
Or so help me God, I will find you

36:17.716 --> 36:20.617
and I will rip your hearts
out with my bare hands.

36:20.619 --> 36:21.985
You have my word.

36:21.987 --> 36:23.753
Vaya con dios.

36:24.622 --> 36:26.890
I'm cool if you're cool.

36:29.660 --> 36:31.761
Give me the keys to the R.V.

36:47.745 --> 36:48.612
Aah!

36:48.614 --> 36:50.914
You can keep that.

37:02.293 --> 37:04.728
Everything all right?

37:06.264 --> 37:07.264
It worked.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.534
You are free.

37:11.669 --> 37:13.670
What about Richie and Seth?

37:15.606 --> 37:17.874
I have a feeling whatever they're into,

37:17.876 --> 37:19.843
they're never gonna be free of.

37:22.780 --> 37:25.982
Be able to get back on your own?

37:25.984 --> 37:28.652
Honestly, I have no idea where I'm going.

37:29.987 --> 37:32.889
But I think, after tonight,
I'm gonna be fine.

37:41.299 --> 37:42.966
Take care of yourself, Kate.

37:46.804 --> 37:48.972
You take care of your little girl.

38:28.738 --> 38:31.438
_

38:31.463 --> 38:33.963
_

38:33.988 --> 38:36.988
_

38:37.013 --> 38:42.513
- _
- _

38:42.538 --> 38:45.538
_

38:46.653 --> 38:50.153
_

38:50.854 --> 38:52.854
_

38:53.752 --> 38:55.752
_

38:56.292 --> 38:58.292
_

38:58.716 --> 39:01.716
_

39:02.890 --> 39:04.890
_

40:12.839 --> 40:15.841
Well, if that don't get me
religion, I don't know what will.

40:22.984 --> 40:24.817
You can't walk in the sun.

40:24.819 --> 40:26.118
Not yet.

40:29.990 --> 40:33.092
You said you were always
just trying to save me, Seth.

40:35.262 --> 40:37.763
You did.

40:38.932 --> 40:40.833
Now you have to let me go.

40:42.869 --> 40:46.639
Buddy, we just pulled it off out there.

40:46.641 --> 40:47.840
There's no
reason we can't...

40:47.842 --> 40:49.842
We can't keep putting down scores.

40:49.844 --> 40:52.278
- It's not just about the score.
- It's always about the score.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.014
If it was, you would've
just taken the money.

40:59.019 --> 41:01.120
We got to go.

41:03.056 --> 41:06.292
You, uh...

41:06.294 --> 41:09.595
You ever find that beach and
blue agave, you let me know.

41:11.798 --> 41:13.699
Maybe I'll come join you.

41:21.041 --> 41:23.776
Don't bother.

41:50.837 --> 41:52.905
You want some company?

42:05.085 --> 42:06.785
Yeah.

42:08.021 --> 42:09.622
But not in that.

42:11.891 --> 42:13.058
Hell, no.

42:31.978 --> 42:34.179
We should be hunting her down.

42:34.181 --> 42:35.881
Eh, sorry, Carlitos,

42:35.883 --> 42:37.983
but the order comes straight from on high.

42:37.985 --> 42:40.986
Yeah, they love their games,
even if they did just lose.

42:40.988 --> 42:43.122
No, they... They
think they can use you

42:43.124 --> 42:45.157
to bring down Santanico.

42:45.159 --> 42:49.662
They said that you need
to be... Re-educated.

43:01.074 --> 43:03.909
You know I'll never make it out.

43:03.911 --> 43:05.177
Pues entonces.

43:05.179 --> 43:07.079
Good luck.
