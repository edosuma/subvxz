00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
<i>Hello?
'Dr O'Loughlin.'</i>

00:01.400 --> 00:04.240
<i>We've found what you were
looking for... Catherine's journal.</i>

00:04.240 --> 00:06.520
<i>Now I can understand why
you were so desperate to have it.</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:08.480
<i>We're charging you with her murder.</i>

00:08.480 --> 00:11.560
<i>And you're the only alibi I've got.
I-I'm so sorry, Cara.</i>

00:11.560 --> 00:13.400
<i>Who was screaming?
The blades.</i>

00:13.400 --> 00:16.560
<i>You know, they cut the air,
and the air screams in pain.</i>

00:16.560 --> 00:18.520
<i>Erm, I'm at your place, buddy.
She, er...</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:20.120
<i>She doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:22.640
<i>'His name isn't Bobby Moran,
it's Bobby Morgan.'</i>

00:22.640 --> 00:25.240
<i>He is involved somehow.
I know he is.</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:27.440
<i>Look, he's not from London.
He's from Liverpool.</i>

00:27.440 --> 00:29.200
<i>So, Bobby Morgan, I had a look...</i>

00:29.200 --> 00:31.440
<i>Right, he was abused by his dad.</i>

00:31.440 --> 00:33.720
<i>A court order stopped him
from having any contact.</i>

00:33.720 --> 00:36.880
<i>Bobby worshipped his dad.
Lenny killed himself.</i>

00:36.880 --> 00:39.240
<i>But it wasn't my case.
I-I'd have remembered him.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:42.600
<i>Well, you must've sat in
for someone, just for that session.</i>

00:42.600 --> 00:45.720
<i>These are her references:
Dr Gerald Owens, consultant...</i>

00:45.720 --> 00:48.440
<i>That's Jack.
He's been having an affair with her.</i>

00:48.440 --> 00:51.800
<i>We know Dr Owens
didn't meet Catherine that night.</i>

00:51.800 --> 00:53.920
<i>How?
'Just ask your wife.'</i>

01:01.480 --> 01:05.520
<i>JULIANNE HUMMING LULLABY</i>

01:17.920 --> 01:21.960
<i>SHE RESUMES HUMMING</i>

01:55.480 --> 01:57.320
<i>Why did you lie to the police, Jack?</i>

02:01.080 --> 02:04.200
<i>What? You told them
your affair with Catherine</i>

02:04.200 --> 02:06.960
<i>ended two years ago,
but it didn't, did it?</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:10.760
<i>They think I killed her
because of your lies.</i>

02:12.520 --> 02:14.840
<i>You see, they found her journal...</i>

02:14.840 --> 02:17.480
<i>evidence of an affair with a man
that she wrote up</i>

02:17.480 --> 02:19.960
<i>as "JO".</i>

02:19.960 --> 02:21.920
<i>They think that's proof
that I killed her.</i>

02:23.720 --> 02:27.680
<i>But what they didn't know
is that your friends call YOU Jack,</i>

02:27.680 --> 02:29.400
<i>so we've the same initials.</i>

02:31.040 --> 02:33.280
<i>I know you're involved
in her murder.</i>

02:33.280 --> 02:35.520
<i>What?
You sent Bobby Morgan to me.</i>

02:35.520 --> 02:38.960
<i>You are part of him setting me up.
Joe, that is ridiculous.</i>

02:38.960 --> 02:41.160
<i>So why did you lie to them, then?
Hm?</i>

02:41.160 --> 02:42.920
<i>Because...</i>

02:42.920 --> 02:44.840
<i>Because I didn't wanna be
dragged into the mess</i>

02:44.840 --> 02:46.080
<i>you'd gotten yourself into.</i>

02:46.080 --> 02:49.840
<i>Joe! Joe, stop it. Stop it!
Listen to me.</i>

02:49.840 --> 02:53.400
<i>I had nothing to do with
Catherine's murder, OK? Nothing!</i>

02:56.240 --> 02:58.120
<i>I know all about...
Joe. ..you and Catherine.</i>

02:58.120 --> 02:59.840
<i>No.
Yeah, I found out... Joe!</i>

02:59.840 --> 03:03.320
<i>...in Liverpool, you talked her into
applying for a job at my practice.</i>

03:03.320 --> 03:05.120
<i>You did it!
Yes, and?</i>

03:05.120 --> 03:06.960
<i>Gave her a good reference, too.
Why not?</i>

03:06.960 --> 03:08.800
<i>A good reference?
Cheers for that, mate (!)</i>

03:08.800 --> 03:10.400
<i>Found your stash, by the way.</i>

03:11.720 --> 03:14.000
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:17.680
<i>Is that what this was all about?
Your obsession with Julianne?</i>

03:17.680 --> 03:19.920
<i>Of course that's not
what this was all about, I'm not...</i>

03:19.920 --> 03:21.960
<i>FOOTSTEPS APPROACH</i>

03:40.640 --> 03:43.560
<i>I've never fallen out of love
with you...</i>

03:43.560 --> 03:46.400
<i>Never.
Oh.</i>

03:46.400 --> 03:47.920
<i>HE SCOFFS</i>

03:49.480 --> 03:52.080
<i>You never did get over us
getting together, did you?</i>

03:52.080 --> 03:54.160
<i>You...</i>

03:54.160 --> 03:57.360
<i>You've never shown any remorse
or regret or even apology</i>

03:57.360 --> 03:59.240
<i>for the way
you betrayed me back then...</i>

03:59.240 --> 04:01.880
<i>That justifies you keeping quiet
about Catherine? Oh, right (!)</i>

04:01.880 --> 04:04.480
<i>I didn't keep quiet deliberately
for Christ... Catherine?</i>

04:04.480 --> 04:08.240
<i>Yes. OK, yes! Catherine, she came
to me years ago to talk about Joe,</i>

04:08.240 --> 04:10.640
<i>and... we never intended
for anything to happen -</i>

04:10.640 --> 04:14.600
<i>it did and we kept it secret -
but it did end two years ago.</i>

04:14.600 --> 04:17.040
<i>And... yes,</i>

04:17.040 --> 04:20.440
<i>we saw each other a few times
after that, but I...</i>

04:20.440 --> 04:23.640
<i>I had no idea she kept a journal.</i>

04:23.640 --> 04:24.920
<i>I had no idea.</i>

04:24.920 --> 04:27.240
<i>So, of course,
I will go to the police,</i>

04:27.240 --> 04:30.720
<i>and I will tell them she was writing
about me. Of course I will...</i>

04:30.720 --> 04:32.240
<i>Why didn't you speak up before?</i>

04:33.880 --> 04:36.080
<i>Well, to be perfectly honest,</i>

04:36.080 --> 04:38.480
<i>and as horrific as what happened
to Catherine was, I...</i>

04:38.480 --> 04:40.360
<i>I didn't see how me wading in
was gonna help.</i>

04:40.360 --> 04:43.240
<i>No, no, no, no. You knew by
holding back that it would hurt me</i>

04:43.240 --> 04:45.000
<i>and wreck everything we have.
You knew it!</i>

04:45.000 --> 04:47.280
<i>Well, I had no idea
you would be caught out</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:49.760
<i>having an affair with a prostitute.
Oh, an affair?</i>

04:49.760 --> 04:51.920
<i>You see what he's doing?
Really? It wasn't an affair?</i>

04:51.920 --> 04:54.600
<i>Enough. It just... Enough!</i>

05:01.720 --> 05:03.200
<i>Get out of our house.</i>

05:05.840 --> 05:07.560
<i>HE EXHALES SLOWLY</i>

05:48.240 --> 05:50.720
<i>When the police told me
about Catherine's journal...</i>

05:52.400 --> 05:54.480
<i>...I did think you'd been
having an affair with her.</i>

05:57.040 --> 06:01.040
<i>They had proof.
They said it with such conviction.</i>

06:02.760 --> 06:05.520
<i>But not for a moment did I think you
could've done those things to her.</i>

06:05.520 --> 06:08.400
<i>What about Jack?
Could he have done it?</i>

06:09.920 --> 06:12.560
<i>No.
Yeah, but it's just...</i>

06:12.560 --> 06:15.440
<i>whoever called the police
to the cemetery knew we'd be there.</i>

06:16.720 --> 06:20.320
<i>How many people know us that well?
Truly?</i>

06:20.320 --> 06:23.200
<i>You've known Jack 20 years,
that's not who he is.</i>

06:26.000 --> 06:28.040
<i>HE SIGHS</i>

06:36.280 --> 06:37.520
<i>I need to see her.</i>

06:39.400 --> 06:41.440
<i>Yes.</i>

07:08.880 --> 07:10.640
<i>Thank you.
Yeah, appreciate it.</i>

07:12.200 --> 07:15.920
<i>Dr Gerald Owens walked out of the
O'Loughlin house a few minutes ago.</i>

07:15.920 --> 07:17.800
<i>He'd been inside about three hours,</i>

07:17.800 --> 07:21.400
<i>and airports, railways, ports,
all on alert for O'Loughlin.</i>

07:23.000 --> 07:26.200
<i>He'll probably do a walk-in with
a team of lawyers and a PR wizard.</i>

07:27.560 --> 07:29.760
<i>See...</i>

07:29.760 --> 07:32.640
<i>he tries to blame Bobby Moran,</i>

07:32.640 --> 07:34.960
<i>but that didn't work, right?</i>

07:34.960 --> 07:37.840
<i>So he switched
to pointing at Dr Owens,</i>

07:37.840 --> 07:39.520
<i>but, of course,
that didn't work either.</i>

07:39.520 --> 07:41.320
<i>O'Loughlin would've known that.</i>

07:44.360 --> 07:47.080
<i>He wrote this article for a magazine</i>

07:47.080 --> 07:49.680
<i>about delusional behaviour
in certain criminals.</i>

07:49.680 --> 07:53.320
<i>A cop from Montana
investigating his own crime</i>

07:53.320 --> 07:57.040
<i>convinces everyone that
he's trying to get at the truth.</i>

07:57.040 --> 07:58.760
<i>He lives the part,</i>

07:58.760 --> 08:01.760
<i>tells everyone around him
that he's the one being set up.</i>

08:01.760 --> 08:03.720
<i>Right?</i>

08:03.720 --> 08:06.240
<i>He follows all kinds of leads.</i>

08:06.240 --> 08:08.800
<i>He even convinces himself
that he's in real danger</i>

08:08.800 --> 08:12.440
<i>as he's hunting this killer down,
and he gets away with it.</i>

08:13.400 --> 08:15.160
<i>And only after he dies,</i>

08:15.160 --> 08:17.160
<i>do they find out
how guilty he really was.</i>

08:17.160 --> 08:19.400
<i>Now...</i>

08:19.400 --> 08:22.440
<i>if that's O'Loughlin's game plan...</i>

08:24.800 --> 08:26.400
<i>...what's his next move?</i>

08:31.000 --> 08:33.120
<i>When she's sparked out,
she's really out, huh?</i>

08:34.320 --> 08:35.560
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:38.840 --> 08:40.000
<i>HE SIGHS</i>

08:41.880 --> 08:43.960
<i>How did you get past the police?</i>

08:43.960 --> 08:46.960
<i>The Franklins' compost heap.</i>

08:46.960 --> 08:50.400
<i>It's up to the top
of our back fence... Easy climb.</i>

08:57.200 --> 08:58.640
<i>I know about the baby.</i>

09:00.360 --> 09:01.960
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:07.240
<i>Up and down. Dizzy sometimes.</i>

09:07.240 --> 09:08.840
<i>And you?
Have you got your medicines?</i>

09:10.840 --> 09:12.920
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:14.080 --> 09:16.280
<i>Good.</i>

09:17.720 --> 09:18.960
<i>Can I stay?</i>

09:20.680 --> 09:22.240
<i>Put my head down for a few hours?</i>

09:24.320 --> 09:26.840
<i>Yes, but you have to tell the police
Cara's your alibi.</i>

09:26.840 --> 09:28.680
<i>I will.</i>

09:29.720 --> 09:31.760
<i>I'll tell them
as soon as I've warned Cara.</i>

09:31.760 --> 09:33.160
<i>No, tell them now.</i>

09:33.160 --> 09:37.360
<i>I need to be there
when the police arrive, the...</i>

09:37.360 --> 09:39.600
<i>They'll see her
as an unreliable witness, they'll...</i>

09:39.600 --> 09:41.760
<i>So just take care of her first,
forget about us?</i>

09:41.760 --> 09:43.200
<i>Hey, that's not what I'm saying.</i>

09:43.200 --> 09:45.120
<i>Look, if I just go there
and warn her, then...</i>

09:45.120 --> 09:47.880
<i>No. Just go to her!</i>

09:47.880 --> 09:49.880
<i>Then we can talk.</i>

10:05.800 --> 10:08.040
<i>Oh, God... Cara.</i>

10:22.280 --> 10:25.320
<i>Sir! We've just had an alert.</i>

10:25.320 --> 10:27.520
<i>A break-in at Cara Velasco's flat?</i>

10:27.520 --> 10:30.520
<i>A neighbour just called it in.
Velasco?</i>

10:30.520 --> 10:32.880
<i>The sex worker
who introduced me to O'Loughlin.</i>

10:32.880 --> 10:35.960
<i>I put a flag on her address
because of her connection to him.</i>

10:35.960 --> 10:37.280
<i>Yeah, that could be him.</i>

10:37.280 --> 10:39.480
<i>He's looking for somewhere to hide,
she wasn't there,</i>

10:39.480 --> 10:43.400
<i>and he broke in. Right. Let's go.
I'm on Hayes Lane.</i>

11:27.200 --> 11:29.480
<i>First look suggests
she was strangled.</i>

11:32.840 --> 11:36.000
<i>The, er, neighbour who called it in
saw a man running away</i>

11:36.000 --> 11:38.080
<i>and driving off in Velasco's car.</i>

11:38.080 --> 11:40.640
<i>The description fits O'Loughlin.</i>

11:40.640 --> 11:44.640
<i>And do you think they were more than
just therapist and ex-client?</i>

11:46.160 --> 11:48.760
<i>Yeah, that's what it looked like
to me.</i>

11:48.760 --> 11:52.800
<i>He's killed again.
We've got to find him.</i>

11:52.800 --> 11:55.000
<i>Get O'Loughlin circulated
on the PNC,</i>

11:55.000 --> 11:58.520
<i>tag him with a warning:
violence, possible weapons.</i>

11:58.520 --> 12:00.600
<i>Let's get a list
of all the possible addresses</i>

12:00.600 --> 12:03.160
<i>he might run to
and send officers to all of them,</i>

12:03.160 --> 12:05.480
<i>ASAP.
I'll get on it, sir.</i>

12:07.120 --> 12:09.240
<i>Erm... So, er, previously,</i>

12:09.240 --> 12:11.240
<i>I told you that I'd had an affair
with Catherine</i>

12:11.240 --> 12:13.880
<i>and that that had ended
a couple of years ago, and that's...</i>

12:13.880 --> 12:17.680
<i>that's all true, but I think
for purposes of absolute clarity,</i>

12:17.680 --> 12:19.760
<i>I-I-I probably should've added
that we...</i>

12:19.760 --> 12:23.720
<i>we did continue to see each other
a few times subsequently.</i>

12:23.720 --> 12:25.800
<i>How many times?</i>

12:25.800 --> 12:28.280
<i>I'm not en-entirely sure.
It was, er...</i>

12:28.280 --> 12:30.520
<i>it was a few times,
but the point is she would've,</i>

12:30.520 --> 12:33.520
<i>erm, written this all up in...
in her journal.</i>

12:34.560 --> 12:38.720
<i>The "JO" she wrote about
in her journal... that's me.</i>

12:38.720 --> 12:41.960
<i>She knew me as Jack. Jack Owens.</i>

12:41.960 --> 12:44.960
<i>So, erm, when she wrote the initials
"JO", that relates to me</i>

12:44.960 --> 12:46.800
<i>and not to... to Joe O'Loughlin.</i>

12:46.800 --> 12:49.640
<i>And you've known about this
ever since we first interviewed you?</i>

12:49.640 --> 12:50.840
<i>No, absolutely not. No.</i>

12:50.840 --> 12:52.600
<i>I only found out
that she had a journal</i>

12:52.600 --> 12:54.560
<i>when, erm, Joe told me last night.</i>

12:54.560 --> 12:57.120
<i>You were with him last night?</i>

12:57.120 --> 12:58.840
<i>Yes, yes.
I was at his... at his house.</i>

13:01.480 --> 13:02.800
<i>Well, d'you know where he is now?</i>

13:02.800 --> 13:06.120
<i>Well, I assumed he was still there.
I-I thought he'd be coming in</i>

13:06.120 --> 13:08.800
<i>this morning t-to see you guys
and straighten everything out.</i>

13:08.800 --> 13:12.000
<i>I only came in t-to...
to back him up, so...</i>

13:12.000 --> 13:13.240
<i>What's going on?</i>

13:15.240 --> 13:17.840
<i>Did O'Loughlin put you up to this?
Excuse me?</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:20.880
<i>Did O'Loughlin tell you to come in
and tell us about this?</i>

13:20.880 --> 13:23.480
<i>Well, yes.
Obviously, he wanted me to clarify</i>

13:23.480 --> 13:27.480
<i>that Catherine was writing about me
and not him, so, erm... yes.</i>

13:27.480 --> 13:30.520
<i>You've helped him out before, right?
What d'you mean?</i>

13:30.520 --> 13:33.560
<i>You were a character witness
in his defence</i>

13:33.560 --> 13:36.400
<i>against allegations against sexually
assaulting Catherine McCain.</i>

13:36.400 --> 13:39.560
<i>Yes, but that was a totally...
Two ARVs are on their way, sir.</i>

13:39.560 --> 13:42.840
<i>Right. Thank you, Dr Owens.
We may need to question you again.</i>

<i>I haven't seen or heard from him
since he went to warn her</i>

15:08.880 --> 15:11.600
<i>that he was going to use her
as his alibi.</i>

15:11.600 --> 15:13.480
<i>Cara Velasco was found dead
last night.</i>

15:14.480 --> 15:15.560
<i>What?</i>

15:16.760 --> 15:18.680
<i>How?</i>

15:18.680 --> 15:20.760
<i>She'd been strangled.</i>

15:20.760 --> 15:22.560
<i>A man of your husband's description</i>

15:22.560 --> 15:24.480
<i>was seen running away
from her flat...</i>

15:24.480 --> 15:26.880
<i>No. No. No.
We know this is difficult for you.</i>

15:26.880 --> 15:29.720
<i>No! CARA was his alibi!
He would not...</i>

15:29.720 --> 15:31.280
<i>Of course he wouldn't
have killed her.</i>

15:31.280 --> 15:34.080
<i>Your husband claiming
that Cara was his alibi</i>

15:34.080 --> 15:36.920
<i>might not be true...
She absolutely was his alibi!</i>

15:36.920 --> 15:39.680
<i>He would not have lied
about that... to me</i>

15:39.680 --> 15:41.440
<i>because it drove us apart.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:44.240
<i>Julianne... it is understandable,</i>

15:44.240 --> 15:46.280
<i>not wanting to accept
that your husband</i>

15:46.280 --> 15:48.000
<i>is not who you thought he was.</i>

15:48.000 --> 15:50.960
<i>I know exactly who my husband is!</i>

15:50.960 --> 15:52.880
<i>Julianne, he's killed two women.</i>

15:52.880 --> 15:55.240
<i>Help us to stop him killing again.</i>

15:58.040 --> 16:01.040
<i>Where would he go... for help?</i>

16:16.080 --> 16:19.360
<i>Sorry, there's no bacon. Dad...</i>

16:20.880 --> 16:22.520
<i>Can we get back
to what's happening here?</i>

16:26.880 --> 16:28.800
<i>I read your latest book.</i>

16:31.000 --> 16:32.520
<i>Wasn't bad.</i>

16:33.960 --> 16:35.960
<i>I'm banking that (!)</i>

16:35.960 --> 16:39.080
<i>Big compliment
Ah, no, it was a...</i>

16:39.080 --> 16:40.840
<i>was a good, easy read.</i>

16:41.840 --> 16:45.800
<i>All the simple things in life
we take for granted,</i>

16:45.800 --> 16:49.040
<i>other people have phobias about...
Of course, it's not proper medicine.</i>

16:50.200 --> 16:52.840
<i>Psychology still being
a branch of witchcraft.</i>

16:54.520 --> 16:57.400
<i>Where's Ann?
She's out protesting.</i>

16:57.400 --> 17:00.560
<i>About what?
Noisy neighbours.</i>

17:00.560 --> 17:03.200
<i>HE CHORTLES
You don't have any neighbours.</i>

17:06.760 --> 17:08.040
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

17:10.120 --> 17:13.120
<i>Clenching your fists
and fumbling with the cutlery.</i>

17:16.400 --> 17:18.000
<i>HE EXHALES SHARPLY</i>

17:18.000 --> 17:19.720
<i>Is it Parkinson's?</i>

17:23.440 --> 17:24.800
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:27.440 --> 17:29.400
<i>Spot on, Dad.</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:33.160
<i>How long?</i>

17:34.320 --> 17:36.200
<i>Got the diagnosis
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

17:36.200 --> 17:37.640
<i>HE BREATHES SHAKILY</i>

17:39.560 --> 17:41.760
<i>God, Dad,
I'm in so much trouble.</i>

17:41.760 --> 17:43.480
<i>HE EXHALES SHARPLY</i>

17:45.960 --> 17:48.720
<i>Look, I know
you couldn't kill anyone.</i>

17:49.880 --> 17:52.800
<i>Then I went to see the woman
that could've proved that.</i>

17:54.840 --> 17:58.080
<i>I see her there,
lying on the floor, strangled.</i>

17:58.080 --> 18:00.160
<i>I just panicked, Dad. I ran and...</i>

18:02.360 --> 18:04.240
<i>Now traces of me
are gonna be all over her flat,</i>

18:04.240 --> 18:05.560
<i>what am I gonna do?</i>

18:05.560 --> 18:09.120
<i>Look... why would someone
want to set you up for murder?</i>

18:09.120 --> 18:12.360
<i>Why would anyone hate me enough
to do that? I don't know.</i>

18:15.560 --> 18:17.120
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:31.240 --> 18:33.920
<i>He's in a bit of a state,
to be perfectly honest,</i>

18:33.920 --> 18:36.000
<i>and that he just needs
a bit of help.</i>

18:36.000 --> 18:40.440
<i>I-I-I... Joseph, I don't understand,
why is he running from the police?</i>

18:40.440 --> 18:42.960
<i>Look, I don't know, but
I'm not gonna turn my own son in!</i>

18:42.960 --> 18:46.680
<i>Look, I am just asking the question!
Didn't he tell you anything?</i>

18:48.960 --> 18:50.520
<i>You frightened the life out of me!</i>

18:59.120 --> 19:01.600
<i>Oh... look at you.
JOE CHUCKLES</i>

19:03.880 --> 19:05.920
<i>How's Julianne and Charlie?</i>

19:05.920 --> 19:08.080
<i>Yeah, yeah, they're good.
They're good.</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:10.400
<i>Julianne is pregnant.
SHE GASPS</i>

19:11.600 --> 19:13.520
<i>Oh, that's marvellous. Yeah.</i>

19:13.520 --> 19:16.520
<i>It's just been difficult lately. With...</i>

19:16.520 --> 19:19.440
<i>the false accusations and everything
that's been happening,</i>

19:19.440 --> 19:21.240
<i>we've been having
a hard time of it.</i>

19:21.240 --> 19:23.240
<i>Look, I-I need to make a move.</i>

19:23.240 --> 19:24.800
<i>The police are gonna be
looking for me.</i>

19:24.800 --> 19:26.600
<i>It's best that I'm not here.</i>

19:26.600 --> 19:28.280
<i>Before you go...</i>

19:28.280 --> 19:31.080
<i>ven a ver el jardin.</i>

19:32.720 --> 19:34.720
<i>"Come and look at the garden."</i>

19:34.720 --> 19:37.400
<i>I've been taking Spanish lessons,
come on.</i>

19:39.720 --> 19:42.560
<i>If you can't face telling him,
you know you can tell me.</i>

19:42.560 --> 19:45.120
<i>Honestly, I wish I could,
I've no idea.</i>

19:45.120 --> 19:49.440
<i>Why didn't you answer his calls?
Worried himself into a ditch.</i>

19:51.840 --> 19:54.680
<i>Breaks my heart
the way you two are strangers.</i>

19:54.680 --> 19:57.280
<i>We've been strangers a long time.
HE SNIFFS</i>

19:59.240 --> 20:00.400
<i>He never blamed you</i>

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
<i>for not getting your mother
out of that house.</i>

20:02.400 --> 20:04.480
<i>You were only a child.</i>

20:04.480 --> 20:07.040
<i>He never looked at me the same way
after it, either.</i>

20:08.320 --> 20:10.160
<i>Honestly, you two are impossible.</i>

20:13.160 --> 20:14.800
<i>Now, this is all different.</i>

20:16.120 --> 20:19.040
<i>We hired an odd-job man to help out.</i>

20:19.040 --> 20:22.200
<i>Oh, we converted the barn.
Come and have a look.</i>

20:22.200 --> 20:26.960
<i>Dad said you were out...
protesting against noisy neighbours?</i>

20:28.280 --> 20:31.200
<i>They're planning a wind farm
up on the ridge.</i>

20:31.200 --> 20:33.200
<i>Yeah, I know wind power
is the way to go,</i>

20:33.200 --> 20:35.680
<i>but that ridge is the wrong place.</i>

20:35.680 --> 20:37.880
<i>Now, he took me to have a listen
to some turbines,</i>

20:37.880 --> 20:39.880
<i>and the air was...</i>

20:39.880 --> 20:42.560
<i>screaming in pain. Screaming!</i>

20:44.280 --> 20:45.920
<i>What did you say?</i>

20:45.920 --> 20:47.400
<i>When?</i>

20:47.400 --> 20:50.480
<i>Just now. You...
You said, "screaming in pain".</i>

20:50.480 --> 20:51.720
<i>W-What...?</i>

20:55.920 --> 20:58.120
<i>Where did you get this?
Ow, Joe, you're hurting me!</i>

20:58.120 --> 20:59.920
<i>Who gave this to you?</i>

20:59.920 --> 21:01.280
<i>Bobby.</i>

21:02.560 --> 21:04.120
<i>Bobby?</i>

21:04.120 --> 21:05.680
<i>The odd-job man.</i>

21:05.680 --> 21:09.640
<i>He likes carving,
he... did us both a whale.</i>

21:09.640 --> 21:11.640
<i>He sent it in the post
a few days ago.</i>

21:11.640 --> 21:14.800
<i>Here, take it. You can have it.</i>

21:14.800 --> 21:17.880
<i>W-When was he here?
About a year ago. Why?</i>

21:17.880 --> 21:19.920
<i>And you're still in contact with...</i>

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
<i>Yes, he... he phones,
and he writes now and then.</i>

21:21.920 --> 21:23.240
<i>What's the problem?</i>

21:23.240 --> 21:26.640
<i>How did you meet him?
Well, he just turned up.</i>

21:26.640 --> 21:28.480
<i>You know, we get a lot
of walkers passing by.</i>

21:28.480 --> 21:31.160
<i>We got chatting.
Well, he only wanted room and board,</i>

21:31.160 --> 21:33.200
<i>and he got on so well
with your father.</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:35.680
<i>He's the one
who got me learning Spanish.</i>

21:39.680 --> 21:43.040
<i>Where's your phone?
It's in the house.</i>

21:45.120 --> 21:46.160
<i>Joe!</i>

21:47.520 --> 21:50.040
<i>I need a phone!
What? Er...</i>

21:50.040 --> 21:51.720
<i>Any phone, your phone. Quick!</i>

21:51.720 --> 21:55.120
<i>Vamos a practicar
el verbo "hacer".</i>

21:55.120 --> 21:58.560
<i>Un ejemplo,
"Que hiciste la semana pasada?"</i>

21:58.560 --> 22:02.280
<i>Kam, could you translate, please?</i>

22:02.280 --> 22:05.840
<i>Er, were you asking us,
"Where am I going next week?"</i>

22:05.840 --> 22:08.920
<i>Wrong tense, and, no, I wasn't.
Anyone?</i>

22:08.920 --> 22:10.960
<i>PHONE VIBRATES</i>

22:19.160 --> 22:21.360
<i>Yes, erm... Robert.</i>

22:21.360 --> 22:22.520
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:22.520 --> 22:26.480
<i>Erm, you were asking,
"What was I up to last week?"</i>

22:26.480 --> 22:30.320
<i>That's what you said.
Yes, Robert, good translation.</i>

22:30.320 --> 22:32.600
<i>Well, I was up to no good.
CLASS GIGGLES</i>

22:43.680 --> 22:44.960
<i>KNOCKING</i>

22:50.880 --> 22:53.800
<i>Muchas gracias. Erm,
I'm awfully sorry to trouble you,</i>

22:53.800 --> 22:56.120
<i>but, erm, it's a bit
of a mad question, actually,</i>

22:56.120 --> 22:58.640
<i>but are you going
anywhere near Kentish Town at all?</i>

22:58.640 --> 23:01.440
<i>Er, yes, I live there.
Oh, fantastic!</i>

23:01.440 --> 23:03.720
<i>Oh, do you think it'd be possible
to get a lift?</i>

23:06.120 --> 23:07.560
<i>I've... I've hurt my ankle.</i>

23:07.560 --> 23:10.520
<i>Oh, OK. Yeah, sure, of course.</i>

23:13.800 --> 23:15.240
<i>ROBERT SIGHS IN RELIEF</i>

23:18.440 --> 23:20.680
<i>Muy amable.</i>

23:20.680 --> 23:24.160
<i>What room did he stay in?
Does that matter?</i>

23:24.160 --> 23:25.720
<i>Your old bedroom.</i>

23:25.720 --> 23:29.120
<i>In one of my sessions
with Bobby, he...</i>

23:29.120 --> 23:34.080
<i>he asked me who would win in a fight
between a lion and a tiger.</i>

23:34.080 --> 23:35.920
<i>It's from one of the books upstairs.</i>

23:35.920 --> 23:38.640
<i>One of the kids' books.
It... It's a trick question.</i>

23:38.640 --> 23:40.880
<i>They both live
in different continents, but...</i>

23:40.880 --> 23:42.240
<i>that's where he got it from.</i>

23:42.240 --> 23:44.640
<i>I thought it was a coincidence,
but i-it's not. He's...</i>

23:44.640 --> 23:47.000
<i>He's playing me.
That's what he was doing here.</i>

23:47.000 --> 23:49.800
<i>He came here
to get details from you.</i>

23:49.800 --> 23:51.920
<i>Did-Did... Did he ask you
questions about Mum?</i>

23:51.920 --> 23:54.640
<i>Or-Or the date I go to the grave?
Anything?</i>

23:56.040 --> 23:57.120
<i>Dad!</i>

23:58.200 --> 23:59.800
<i>Your father likes to talk about you</i>

23:59.800 --> 24:02.760
<i>because you hardly ever visit
or call us.</i>

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
<i>Did you talk to him
about Catherine McCain?</i>

24:04.760 --> 24:06.120
<i>Who?
Dad?</i>

24:06.120 --> 24:08.000
<i>Did you?</i>

24:08.000 --> 24:09.320
<i>Yes.</i>

24:09.320 --> 24:11.200
<i>Oh...
HE SIGHS</i>

24:11.200 --> 24:14.720
<i>H-He talked to me about his history
of self-harm, and...</i>

24:14.720 --> 24:17.000
<i>I remembered her name</i>

24:17.000 --> 24:19.920
<i>because it was the first time
we talked about your work.</i>

24:19.920 --> 24:22.360
<i>How hard you worked
to get her to stop.</i>

24:24.160 --> 24:25.600
<i>I was proud of you!</i>

24:29.800 --> 24:30.960
<i>You've done pretty well</i>

24:30.960 --> 24:33.040
<i>for someone who's hardly ever
turned up to class.</i>

24:33.040 --> 24:34.880
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

24:34.880 --> 24:38.120
<i>Growing up, my mother used to, erm,
speak a few phrases,</i>

24:38.120 --> 24:41.040
<i>but the same ones
over and over again.</i>

24:41.040 --> 24:42.160
<i>Well, she's sick now.</i>

24:44.720 --> 24:47.640
<i>She's actually dying,
and she's only 42. It's quite sad.</i>

24:47.640 --> 24:49.440
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

24:49.440 --> 24:51.240
<i>She used to think
that speaking Spanish</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:53.560
<i>made her sound more exotic.</i>

24:53.560 --> 24:55.320
<i>She used to, like,
flirt with other men,</i>

24:55.320 --> 24:57.720
<i>and that used to, like,
really upset my dad.</i>

24:57.720 --> 25:00.680
<i>So, in Espanolo,</i>

25:00.680 --> 25:02.640
<i>I'm gonna tell her
how much I hate her...</i>

25:03.960 --> 25:07.120
<i>...and what a nasty, horrible bitch
she's been because she has.</i>

25:07.120 --> 25:08.600
<i>HE CHUCKLES</i>

25:09.880 --> 25:13.080
<i>She's no linguist,
but I think she'll get the gist.</i>

25:13.080 --> 25:14.840
<i>SHE GASPS
There's no real justice</i>

25:14.840 --> 25:17.320
<i>without retribution,
don't you agree, Mrs O'Loughlin?</i>

25:17.320 --> 25:19.520
<i>HE CHUCKLES
Please let me out, Robert.</i>

25:19.520 --> 25:21.960
<i>HE LAUGHS MANIACALLY
You know what, I've...</i>

25:21.960 --> 25:24.160
<i>I've enjoyed sitting here with you.
It's been nice.</i>

25:24.160 --> 25:26.320
<i>You know your husband
was supposed to help me out?</i>

25:26.320 --> 25:29.560
<i>Did you know that?
SHE BREATHES QUICKLY</i>

25:29.560 --> 25:30.600
<i>He lied to the police</i>

25:30.600 --> 25:33.080
<i>and told them that
I'd killed someone when I didn't.</i>

25:33.080 --> 25:34.360
<i>CAR HORN BLARES</i>

25:38.000 --> 25:39.360
<i>You OK?</i>

25:39.360 --> 25:41.440
<i>He asked for a lift.
He's scaring me.</i>

25:41.440 --> 25:42.920
<i>Come here.</i>

25:44.000 --> 25:46.560
<i>Thank you
Get out. Out!</i>

25:46.560 --> 25:48.080
<i>I'm... I'm sorry I upset you.</i>

25:48.080 --> 25:50.360
<i>I'm just angry at your husband,
that's all. Just go away!</i>

25:50.360 --> 25:53.080
<i>You heard her, leave. Now!</i>

25:53.080 --> 25:54.800
<i>I'm calling the police!</i>

25:54.800 --> 25:56.200
<i>And tell them what?</i>

25:58.240 --> 25:59.560
<i>Move!</i>

26:08.200 --> 26:11.640
<i>You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

26:11.640 --> 26:13.200
<i>Do you want me to call the police?</i>

26:13.200 --> 26:15.080
<i>No... thanks.</i>

26:21.360 --> 26:23.320
<i>PHONE RINGS</i>

26:25.320 --> 26:26.840
<i>It's me.
Oh, Joe.</i>

26:28.040 --> 26:30.080
<i>SHE INHALES SHAKILY
Oh, God. Thank God.</i>

26:30.080 --> 26:31.760
<i>What happened?
SHE PANTS FRANTICALLY</i>

26:31.760 --> 26:34.280
<i>I think that patient of yours...
B-B-Bobby?</i>

26:34.280 --> 26:36.240
<i>I think he was in the car with me
just now.</i>

26:36.240 --> 26:38.760
<i>'I thought his name was Robert.
He's been attending my classes</i>

26:38.760 --> 26:40.360
<i>'for a couple of months,
off and on...'</i>

26:40.360 --> 26:41.800
<i>Are you hurt?
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY</i>

26:41.800 --> 26:43.680
<i>'No. But God knows
what would've happened</i>

26:43.680 --> 26:44.800
<i>'if DJ hadn't been there.'</i>

26:44.800 --> 26:46.600
<i>He said you lied to him
about the police.</i>

26:46.600 --> 26:49.440
<i>I didn't... No, I-I-I didn't lie.
W-Where's Charlie?</i>

26:50.720 --> 26:51.760
<i>She's at school.</i>

26:51.760 --> 26:54.640
<i>OK, listen to me. You need to go
and get her now, and-and...</i>

26:54.640 --> 26:57.120
<i>'bring DJ with you.'
OK, OK.</i>

26:57.120 --> 26:59.360
<i>D-Did Bobby say anything else?</i>

26:59.360 --> 27:02.680
<i>He... He talked about how he was
gonna visit his dying mother</i>

27:02.680 --> 27:05.280
<i>and how horrible
he was gonna be to her.</i>

27:05.280 --> 27:06.520
<i>There's a car coming.</i>

27:06.520 --> 27:08.360
<i>'Joe! Joe, listen to me.
Joe, the poli...'</i>

27:08.360 --> 27:10.080
<i>The police think you killed Cara.</i>

27:10.080 --> 27:12.520
<i>'I told them she was your alibi,
but they didn't believe me.'</i>

27:12.520 --> 27:13.600
<i>Police.</i>

27:14.560 --> 27:17.880
<i>Jackson's Wood.
PHONE BANGS ON TABLE</i>

27:38.400 --> 27:41.400
<i>CAR WHEELS IN DISTANCE</i>

28:09.640 --> 28:10.760
<i>He's a good lad.</i>

28:10.760 --> 28:13.720
<i>Very shy, erm,
he helps out doing odd jobs.</i>

28:17.520 --> 28:19.760
<i>Erm...</i>

28:19.760 --> 28:22.040
<i>Listen, I'm...
I'm so sorry, you know.</i>

28:22.040 --> 28:24.640
<i>I didn't... I didn't mean
to upset Mrs O'Loughlin, honestly.</i>

28:24.640 --> 28:26.760
<i>I, erm...
HE GULPS</i>

28:26.760 --> 28:28.840
<i>Please don't take me away again.
Not now.</i>

28:28.840 --> 28:31.080
<i>It's OK. Calm down, Bobby.
Thank you.</i>

28:32.560 --> 28:34.040
<i>Can we just get one thing straight?</i>

28:34.040 --> 28:36.760
<i>Is it Bobby Moran
or Bobby Morgan?</i>

28:36.760 --> 28:41.320
<i>I was... I was born Morgan,
but I... I changed it to Moran.</i>

28:41.320 --> 28:42.840
<i>Why?
Erm...</i>

28:43.840 --> 28:46.600
<i>Because I wanted to become
someone else. I...</i>

28:46.600 --> 28:48.600
<i>I didn't have a great childhood
if I'm honest.</i>

28:48.600 --> 28:52.520
<i>All right. And...
how have you upset Mrs O'Loughlin?</i>

28:52.520 --> 28:55.280
<i>Erm... Well, sh-she gave me a lift.</i>

28:56.280 --> 28:57.680
<i>What were you doing in her car?</i>

28:57.680 --> 28:59.840
<i>Well, I've... erm...</i>

28:59.840 --> 29:02.720
<i>I've actually got a bad ankle,
and she's my Spanish teacher.</i>

29:02.720 --> 29:04.840
<i>How long has she been your teacher?</i>

29:04.840 --> 29:06.640
<i>A few months.</i>

29:06.640 --> 29:10.040
<i>Erm... Dr O'Loughlin suggested
that I-I take up Spanish lessons.</i>

29:11.440 --> 29:13.240
<i>It was... It was his idea?</i>

29:13.240 --> 29:16.320
<i>Well... Well, yeah, like,
when I, erm...</i>

29:16.320 --> 29:18.400
<i>I first went to him,
he thought it would do me good,</i>

29:18.400 --> 29:20.080
<i>you know,
to try something different.</i>

29:20.080 --> 29:23.040
<i>I thought it was quite a good idea,
really. Er...</i>

29:24.280 --> 29:28.280
<i>And I... I told Mrs O'Loughlin
how angry I was at her husband,</i>

29:28.280 --> 29:31.600
<i>for telling you guys all...
all those lies about me. Er...</i>

29:31.600 --> 29:33.960
<i>So, erm... sorry about that.</i>

29:35.240 --> 29:39.600
<i>Did you... visit and then stay with
Dr O'Loughlin's father</i>

29:39.600 --> 29:42.720
<i>and stepmother about a year ago?
Yeah, yeah, I did.</i>

29:42.720 --> 29:44.720
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

29:44.720 --> 29:48.480
<i>Well, that's how all this
came to be. Erm...</i>

29:48.480 --> 29:50.520
<i>I was, like, on a walk, and, erm...</i>

29:51.600 --> 29:54.160
<i>...I, like, stopped
and started talking to them,</i>

29:54.160 --> 29:55.720
<i>and they were, like,
really friendly,</i>

29:55.720 --> 29:57.360
<i>and they sort of took me in.</i>

29:57.360 --> 29:59.280
<i>And then, Mr O'Loughlin, he...</i>

29:59.280 --> 30:02.560
<i>he kept on going on about how good
of a psychologist his son was,</i>

30:02.560 --> 30:05.160
<i>and, erm...
and how he'd helped a lot of people.</i>

30:05.160 --> 30:09.040
<i>So I got myself referred
to Dr O'Loughlin,</i>

30:09.040 --> 30:12.560
<i>and then that's how all this
started, really. Erm, so...</i>

30:14.320 --> 30:16.120
<i>Where were you yesterday evening?</i>

30:17.120 --> 30:20.200
<i>Why?
Just answer the question, Bobby.</i>

30:21.200 --> 30:23.040
<i>I... I was here.
I mean, you can ask anyone.</i>

30:23.040 --> 30:25.360
<i>I-I don't really go out much.</i>

30:25.360 --> 30:28.400
<i>The only time I did go out
was to go to Spanish lessons, but...</i>

30:28.400 --> 30:30.360
<i>I suppose that's all over now,
isn't it, really?</i>

30:34.480 --> 30:36.400
<i>I think Morgan's telling the truth.</i>

30:36.400 --> 30:38.920
<i>He's got cast-iron alibis
for both murders.</i>

30:38.920 --> 30:41.520
<i>But is he involved somehow?</i>

30:41.520 --> 30:44.120
<i>Yeah, only in as much
as O'Loughlin has set him up.</i>

30:45.320 --> 30:47.760
<i>We've got the warrants
for the phone taps.</i>

30:47.760 --> 30:50.520
<i>Second murder must have helped
push them through.</i>

30:55.280 --> 30:57.520
<i>Fair old walk home for you.
Ah!</i>

30:57.520 --> 30:59.960
<i>I'm from the generation that walks.</i>

31:00.960 --> 31:05.720
<i>Now, this is my much laughed at
"just in case" stash.</i>

31:07.560 --> 31:08.680
<i>Thank you.</i>

31:08.680 --> 31:12.600
<i>Now, I've left Ann
telling the police</i>

31:12.600 --> 31:14.960
<i>that Bobby tricked his way
into our family,</i>

31:14.960 --> 31:17.560
<i>that they were totally wrong
about you.</i>

31:21.920 --> 31:24.280
<i>Will this get me to Liverpool?
JOSEPH CHUCKLES</i>

31:24.280 --> 31:26.920
<i>Well, it smokes a bit,
but it should do.</i>

31:28.880 --> 31:30.160
<i>Why Liverpool?</i>

31:30.160 --> 31:33.760
<i>Julianne said that Bobby
planned on visiting his mother.</i>

31:33.760 --> 31:36.160
<i>But he hates her,
so why go and see her?</i>

31:36.160 --> 31:38.120
<i>That's why I'm going.
I've gotta find out.</i>

31:39.120 --> 31:40.880
<i>Well...</i>

31:40.880 --> 31:43.440
<i>They'll never suspect that anyone
would be daft enough</i>

31:43.440 --> 31:46.320
<i>to try to escape in
the slowest vehicle in the country.</i>

31:50.400 --> 31:51.520
<i>Dad.</i>

32:05.640 --> 32:07.200
<i>Hi.</i>

32:07.200 --> 32:10.280
<i>You have a patient here,
Bridget Aherne?</i>

32:10.280 --> 32:13.240
<i>I'd like to talk to her, please.
Are you family?</i>

32:13.240 --> 32:16.320
<i>No. No, I'm a psychologist.</i>

32:18.080 --> 32:22.080
<i>We haven't asked for a psychologist,
and I can't see Bridget wanting one.</i>

32:23.240 --> 32:24.800
<i>It's about her son, actually.</i>

32:26.240 --> 32:29.080
<i>I didn't know she had one. Yeah.</i>

32:30.080 --> 32:31.760
<i>Yeah, it's important.</i>

32:31.760 --> 32:36.760
<i>A family is trying to heal itself,
and there isn't much time.</i>

32:51.200 --> 32:53.000
<i>You a doctor or a priest?</i>

32:54.480 --> 32:55.920
<i>I'm a psychologist.</i>

32:55.920 --> 32:58.680
<i>SHE SCOFFS
Bit late for that.</i>

33:02.680 --> 33:06.240
<i>Yes to drugs, no to talking.</i>

33:08.600 --> 33:10.400
<i>I'm aware you're very ill, Bridget.</i>

33:13.760 --> 33:14.960
<i>Just there.</i>

33:16.720 --> 33:19.000
<i>Started out the size of a pea.</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:22.400
<i>Big as an orange now.</i>

33:22.400 --> 33:24.280
<i>No.</i>

33:24.280 --> 33:27.880
<i>You're all right where you are.
Be hours before they come in.</i>

33:30.720 --> 33:32.400
<i>I'm here about Bobby.</i>

33:39.920 --> 33:42.000
<i>When was the last time you saw him?</i>

33:44.000 --> 33:45.920
<i>SHE SIGHS
Why, what's he done now?</i>

33:45.920 --> 33:47.840
<i>Serious assault.</i>

33:47.840 --> 33:51.080
<i>To a woman. He didn't know her.</i>

33:52.240 --> 33:54.480
<i>Argument over a taxi escalated.</i>

33:55.480 --> 33:57.200
<i>A psychologist, yeah?</i>

33:59.240 --> 34:02.720
<i>How is he?
He's angry.</i>

34:02.720 --> 34:05.640
<i>He's born angry.
He always blamed me.</i>

34:06.680 --> 34:08.080
<i>Is that why you're here?</i>

34:09.200 --> 34:11.680
<i>Come to give the mother
a good kicking? No.</i>

34:11.680 --> 34:14.560
<i>I'm trying to get at the truth.
Of what?</i>

34:14.560 --> 34:17.120
<i>Of why Bobby's so angry.</i>

34:17.120 --> 34:21.960
<i>You accused your husband...
of sexually abusing Bobby.</i>

34:21.960 --> 34:23.160
<i>Yeah, cos he did.</i>

34:23.160 --> 34:25.200
<i>I read the witness statements.</i>

34:27.600 --> 34:29.680
<i>There's a lot of inconsistencies, Bridget.</i>

34:32.640 --> 34:34.800
<i>Is it possible
it could've been someone else?</i>

34:37.680 --> 34:39.240
<i>It was all properly done.</i>

34:40.440 --> 34:42.160
<i>Everyone got exactly
what they deserved,</i>

34:42.160 --> 34:43.680
<i>especially that Lenny Morgan.</i>

34:44.680 --> 34:46.040
<i>He was weak.</i>

34:48.600 --> 34:50.360
<i>Bobby talked about
how much it hurt Lenny</i>

34:50.360 --> 34:52.120
<i>that you went with other men.</i>

34:54.520 --> 34:57.720
<i>"Death by a thousand cuts"
is how he put it.</i>

34:59.080 --> 35:00.960
<i>I wonder why you did that?</i>

35:02.280 --> 35:04.840
<i>Where did you learn
how to punish like that, Bridget?</i>

35:06.280 --> 35:08.200
<i>Did you pick it up
from your own childhood?</i>

35:10.200 --> 35:13.080
<i>I just loaded the gun,
I didn't fire it.</i>

35:13.080 --> 35:15.320
<i>It was people like you did that.</i>

35:15.320 --> 35:19.480
<i>Doctors, schoolteachers,
social workers, lawyers...</i>

35:19.480 --> 35:22.600
<i>Do-gooders.
So, we all got it wrong, did we?</i>

35:22.600 --> 35:24.640
<i>The judge didn't think so.</i>

35:24.640 --> 35:26.920
<i>Because he saw
a frightened little boy.</i>

35:28.520 --> 35:32.520
<i>Bobby mimicked a woman's voice
in our sessions.</i>

35:34.320 --> 35:35.560
<i>I think it was your voice.</i>

35:37.680 --> 35:40.200
<i>He'd say things like,
"Come along, Bobby.</i>

35:40.200 --> 35:43.680
<i>"Tell the man what happened to you,
and we can all go home."</i>

35:43.680 --> 35:45.720
<i>Who was that man
you were talking about, Bridget?</i>

35:45.720 --> 35:49.240
<i>Erskine. Another weakling.</i>

35:49.240 --> 35:53.480
<i>Did you get Bobby to lie to Erskine?
Bobby lies all the time.</i>

35:53.480 --> 35:56.200
<i>Why does he hate you, Bridget?</i>

35:57.400 --> 35:59.880
<i>Cos we all end up
hating our parents.</i>

35:59.880 --> 36:03.200
<i>No. We don't.</i>

36:06.360 --> 36:09.240
<i>You got Bobby to lie to Erskine,
didn't you?</i>

36:11.320 --> 36:13.880
<i>Your husband never assaulted Bobby,
did he, Bridget?</i>

36:15.520 --> 36:16.600
<i>Did he?</i>

36:18.040 --> 36:21.440
<i>
I'm 42, and I am dying.</i>

36:21.440 --> 36:24.400
<i>I am paying the price
for anything I've done!</i>

36:24.400 --> 36:26.520
<i>MONITOR BEEPS QUICKLY
Can you say the same?</i>

36:28.680 --> 36:29.880
<i>Oh...</i>

36:29.880 --> 36:33.880
<i>You need to leave.
Yeah. Right now!</i>

36:33.880 --> 36:36.120
<i>All right, love, all right.
BRIDGET SOBS</i>

36:36.120 --> 36:38.000
<i>All right. That's it.</i>

36:41.440 --> 36:43.200
<i>RINGING TONE</i>

36:43.200 --> 36:45.720
<i>'Hello?'
Rach? Hi, it's me.</i>

36:45.720 --> 36:48.600
<i>I'm sorry, Rach, but I won't be able
to make your wedding.</i>

36:48.600 --> 36:51.000
<i>Well...
Yeah, I kind of figured that.</i>

36:52.240 --> 36:53.560
<i>I need your help.</i>

36:53.560 --> 36:57.480
<i>Hang on.
Can I have two minutes? Thanks.</i>

37:01.520 --> 37:04.000
<i>Listen... Joe, the police
have been to the practice.</i>

37:04.000 --> 37:05.640
<i>They're asking if we know
where you are.</i>

37:05.640 --> 37:08.280
<i>I... I'm trying
to track down someone</i>

37:08.280 --> 37:10.640
<i>I used to worked with in Liverpool
years ago.</i>

37:10.640 --> 37:14.440
<i>Rupert Erskine is his name.
He's retired now, he's moved away.</i>

37:14.440 --> 37:16.520
<i>Rupert Erskine?
'Yeah.'</i>

37:16.520 --> 37:18.040
<i>It's really important I talk to him.</i>

37:18.040 --> 37:20.360
<i>I just can't stay in one place
long enough to research him.</i>

37:20.360 --> 37:23.880
<i>'I think he's moved south.
London, I reckon.'</i>

37:23.880 --> 37:28.080
<i>And, yeah, I have a memory of him
being high up in the bee world.</i>

37:28.080 --> 37:30.480
<i>'He's... He was always banging on
about bees.'</i>

37:30.480 --> 37:33.200
<i>I don't know if that helps.
'Right.'</i>

37:33.200 --> 37:35.720
<i>Rupert Erskine. Bees. London.</i>

37:35.720 --> 37:38.920
<i>OK, great. Cheers, Rachel.
Talk to you soon.</i>

37:38.920 --> 37:40.720
<i>'Take care.'
Bye.</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:46.400
<i>Come on.</i>

38:28.400 --> 38:30.560
<i>No. Joe, you cannot be here.</i>

38:30.560 --> 38:32.440
<i>The police came to my house
looking for you...</i>

38:32.440 --> 38:35.000
<i>I spoke to Bobby's mother.
I think we got it badly wrong.</i>

38:37.280 --> 38:38.800
<i>Joe, please. Leave. You've...</i>

38:38.800 --> 38:40.680
<i>Bobby was abused,
but not by his father.</i>

38:40.680 --> 38:43.240
<i>His mother pointed the finger
at Lenny to get rid of him.</i>

38:44.240 --> 38:46.120
<i>What... What's that got...?</i>

38:46.120 --> 38:48.040
<i>Yeah, I don't know
what it has to do with me.</i>

38:48.040 --> 38:50.080
<i>Bobby was Erskine's case.
It wasn't mine.</i>

38:50.080 --> 38:53.160
<i>Erskine wrote the report
that accused Bobby's dad. I...</i>

38:53.160 --> 38:55.120
<i>I need to see the file again, Mel.</i>

38:56.240 --> 38:59.040
<i>Please, Mel. Please.
I-I think I'm missing something.</i>

39:00.640 --> 39:04.520
<i>Mrs Morgan, erm...
I appreciate that you're ill, and...</i>

39:05.560 --> 39:08.400
<i>...I know this is hard for you, but...</i>

39:08.400 --> 39:10.760
<i>do you remember anything
he said to you?</i>

39:12.160 --> 39:13.400
<i>He said that...</i>

39:15.280 --> 39:18.720
<i>He said that my son, Bobby,
had attacked a woman...</i>

39:18.720 --> 39:20.560
<i>that he was in a lot of trouble.</i>

39:22.360 --> 39:23.640
<i>I found that distressing.</i>

39:26.080 --> 39:29.400
<i>And... he asked daft questions
about Bobby's childhood.</i>

39:30.400 --> 39:34.360
<i>They... do that, don't they,
psychologists?</i>

39:34.360 --> 39:37.840
<i>Anything goes wrong, it's always
about somebody's childhood, or...</i>

39:37.840 --> 39:39.360
<i>how horrible the parents were.</i>

39:40.800 --> 39:45.000
<i>The alarm went off. I went in.
He was standing over her.</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:46.760
<i>And all her tubes
had been pulled out.</i>

39:46.760 --> 39:49.000
<i>Do you think he pulled them out?</i>

39:49.000 --> 39:52.280
<i>She wasn't making any sense.
She was very distressed.</i>

39:52.280 --> 39:54.760
<i>I chucked him out.
How long was he with her?</i>

39:54.760 --> 39:57.520
<i>Not long. Hm.</i>

39:58.920 --> 39:59.960
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:03.320 --> 40:08.240
<i>What did O'Loughlin want with her?
Was he trying to find something out?</i>

40:08.240 --> 40:11.320
<i>Trying to stop something
from coming to the surface?</i>

40:14.280 --> 40:16.600
<i>It's quite possible
that the nurse came in</i>

40:16.600 --> 40:19.000
<i>and stopped him from killing. Again.</i>

40:20.640 --> 40:22.800
<i>We need to locate
the rest of Bobby Morgan's family,</i>

40:22.800 --> 40:25.600
<i>just in case they're on the list. OK.</i>

40:25.600 --> 40:29.920
<i>Oh, we just intercepted a call from
O'Loughlin to Dr Rachel Fenwick.</i>

40:29.920 --> 40:33.080
<i>Who's she again?
One of the partners at the practice.</i>

40:33.080 --> 40:35.960
<i>Er, she said that he asked her
to trace someone</i>

40:35.960 --> 40:39.400
<i>that he used to work with years ago,
Rupert Erskine.</i>

40:39.400 --> 40:41.120
<i>We've got an address
for Rupert Erskine</i>

40:41.120 --> 40:42.640
<i>somewhere in South London. Good.</i>

40:42.640 --> 40:45.560
<i>Let's get to him first
before O'Loughlin does. Great.</i>

40:47.240 --> 40:51.080
<i>'Bobby, can you draw your dad?
Put him into your picture?'</i>

40:51.080 --> 40:53.520
<i>'No. I just wanna go home.</i>

40:54.600 --> 40:56.000
<i>'I just wanna go home.'</i>

40:58.680 --> 41:00.720
<i>It's not there.</i>

41:00.720 --> 41:02.120
<i>HE SIGHS
It's just...</i>

41:02.120 --> 41:03.440
<i>I did it all by the book.</i>

41:04.880 --> 41:06.520
<i>I only interviewed him once.</i>

41:09.280 --> 41:13.000
<i>What if I'm not seeing something
because it's gone missing?</i>

41:13.000 --> 41:15.520
<i>Like... Erskine's psych report</i>

41:15.520 --> 41:18.680
<i>saying that Bobby was abused
by his dad is here, but...</i>

41:18.680 --> 41:20.800
<i>Where's the report
that got submitted to the court?</i>

41:21.840 --> 41:24.760
<i>Oh, God.
What?</i>

41:26.400 --> 41:30.160
<i>Bobby Morgan submitted a request
to view his file.</i>

41:31.680 --> 41:32.720
<i>When?</i>

41:33.760 --> 41:34.800
<i>Two years ago.</i>

41:37.120 --> 41:39.960
<i>So he could've taken documents
from the file?</i>

41:42.880 --> 41:44.440
<i>HE SIGHS</i>

41:44.440 --> 41:47.840
<i>When he looked at the file,
what names would he have seen?</i>

41:47.840 --> 41:49.960
<i>H-he would've seen your name,
my name, Erskine's,</i>

41:49.960 --> 41:52.160
<i>the teacher who referred Bobby
to the police.</i>

41:52.160 --> 41:54.560
<i>Who else?
Lucas Dutton.</i>

41:54.560 --> 41:56.920
<i>Lucas?
Yeah, erm... He's off sick.</i>

41:56.920 --> 41:59.000
<i>He never recovered
from his daughter's death.</i>

42:00.320 --> 42:01.360
<i>How did she die?</i>

42:03.800 --> 42:07.120
<i>A drug overdose.
Could she have been drugged?</i>

42:13.200 --> 42:14.400
<i>Mel?</i>

42:16.000 --> 42:17.720
<i>Who was driving the car
that killed Boyd?</i>

42:21.160 --> 42:22.200
<i>Why?</i>

42:25.120 --> 42:27.400
<i>It was an accident. Right.</i>

42:28.520 --> 42:29.800
<i>But did the police trace them?</i>

42:29.800 --> 42:32.880
<i>It was joy riders in a stolen car,
so... no, they didn't...</i>

42:32.880 --> 42:35.320
<i>Right, but did the police
get a description of the driver?</i>

42:35.320 --> 42:38.560
<i>Why are you asking? Well,
maybe we're all being punished.</i>

42:40.840 --> 42:43.000
<i>Look when he...
It was an accident, Joe!</i>

42:45.160 --> 42:46.200
<i>OK.</i>

42:55.480 --> 42:57.720
<i>Joe.
Yeah?</i>

43:00.360 --> 43:03.280
<i>So, we take copies
of all of the documents</i>

43:03.280 --> 43:05.040
<i>that get submitted to the court.</i>

43:06.320 --> 43:11.080
<i>Erskine didn't sign the final report
that got put in front of the judge.</i>

43:11.080 --> 43:12.560
<i>Why not?</i>

43:14.760 --> 43:16.280
<i>Come and have a look.</i>

43:25.360 --> 43:28.040
<i>Jesus, that's me. I signed it. Yeah.</i>

43:29.360 --> 43:31.240
<i>But...</i>

43:31.240 --> 43:32.880
<i>But it wasn't my case.
Why did I sign it?</i>

43:32.880 --> 43:34.760
<i>So, it was August.</i>

43:34.760 --> 43:36.640
<i>Erskine was probably away
on holiday.</i>

43:36.640 --> 43:38.360
<i>I must have asked you
to sign it instead.</i>

43:40.040 --> 43:41.800
<i>And Bobby saw my signature.</i>

43:42.800 --> 43:44.040
<i>He holds me responsible</i>

43:44.040 --> 43:45.880
<i>for the courts cutting his dad
out of his life.</i>

43:45.880 --> 43:48.000
<i>Oh, Jesus! I condemned his dad
to being a paedophile.</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:49.040
<i>What?</i>

43:49.040 --> 43:52.160
<i>I killed his dad.
No!</i>

43:54.760 --> 43:58.280
<i>Oh, Jesus, Mel. What have I done?</i>

44:03.920 --> 44:06.040
<i>Who are you calling?</i>

44:06.040 --> 44:08.800
<i>Louise Elwood,
one of Bobby's teachers.</i>

44:08.800 --> 44:11.000
<i>Perhaps she knows
if anything happened to the teacher</i>

44:11.000 --> 44:12.760
<i>who referred Bobby
to the social services.</i>

44:12.760 --> 44:13.800
<i>Here, look...</i>

44:14.880 --> 44:16.600
<i>That's Rupert.
That's Erskine's number.</i>

44:16.600 --> 44:17.960
<i>Call him. I-I can't get through.</i>

44:19.640 --> 44:23.000
<i>Hi, Mrs Elwood?
This is Dr O'Loughlin here.</i>

44:23.000 --> 44:25.040
<i>I'm wondering if you could give me
a call back</i>

44:25.040 --> 44:27.240
<i>whenever you get the chance
on this number, please.</i>

44:44.560 --> 44:45.800
<i>Hello?</i>

44:46.960 --> 44:50.400
<i>Mr Erskine? Police officers.</i>

44:50.400 --> 44:52.120
<i>PHONE RINGS</i>

44:53.360 --> 44:55.200
<i>Hello?</i>

44:59.200 --> 45:00.720
<i>Mr Erskine?</i>

45:02.720 --> 45:04.640
<i>PHONE CONTINUES RINGING</i>

45:18.520 --> 45:21.600
<i>Thank you so much for your help, Louise.</i>

45:21.600 --> 45:24.080
<i>Yeah... yeah, you, too. Take care.</i>

45:25.880 --> 45:27.600
<i>HE SIGHS</i>

45:30.080 --> 45:31.640
<i>Still no answer from Erskine.</i>

45:32.840 --> 45:36.000
<i>So, the teacher who called in
the police and social services</i>

45:36.000 --> 45:38.360
<i>about Bobby's bruises,
Eileen Gorski. Mm-hm?</i>

45:39.520 --> 45:41.000
<i>Her parents died in a house fire.</i>

45:42.560 --> 45:45.400
<i>When?
A year ago. It was a firebomb.</i>

45:46.760 --> 45:49.280
<i>The police said it was an accident,
wrong house targeted.</i>

45:50.760 --> 45:52.560
<i>What if it wasn't the wrong house,
Mel?</i>

45:55.320 --> 45:57.000
<i>What if it wasn't an accident?</i>

45:58.600 --> 46:01.160
<i>Bobby looked at the file,
saw all our names,</i>

46:01.160 --> 46:03.000
<i>and planned his revenge.</i>

46:04.000 --> 46:05.440
<i>This is all a punishment.</i>
