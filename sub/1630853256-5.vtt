WEBVTT

00:14.723 --> 00:16.683
1944.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.603
I've been looking for you,
you little cocktease.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.490
Hello, genetics.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.075
Hmm.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.620
Grandma, pretty good.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.083
Ah-ha.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.504
Hot off the presses, ink's still wet.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.095
Excuse me!
I'm looking for Captain Marton Halász?

00:54.179 --> 00:55.805
Probably dead.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.974
I happen to know that he's alive in 1944.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.019
Help me find him,
and I'll tell you the future.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.813
Not your personal future,
more geopolitical history

01:03.897 --> 01:06.524
with embarrassing holes
in all the usual places.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.692
What's your name?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.069
Vera Peschauer.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.236
And I'm looking for Marton--

01:10.320 --> 01:11.154
Erzebet!

01:11.237 --> 01:12.655
We're late!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.365
Sorry. She's crazy.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.242
She keeps looking for her dead husband.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.995
He died at Voronezh, remember, Erzebet?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.538
Your husband died.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.539
Let's go.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.707
Be quiet, keep going.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.167
Do we know each other?

01:24.250 --> 01:25.460
Hurry up.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.088
Nazis, Hungarians, Hungarian Nazis.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.924
I wish I were selling Venn diagrams.
I'd make a mint.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.384
Shh! What was that about?

01:33.468 --> 01:36.554
If you're not careful,
you're going to wind up on the next train.

01:36.638 --> 01:40.475
Huh. Bossy widow, strong choice!

01:40.558 --> 01:42.102
We're not really widows, right?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.354
Don't give anyone your name.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.730
You're not Vera anymore.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.148
You're Erzebet.

01:47.982 --> 01:48.817
Ah.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.903
And we're evidently
hunting vampires. Got it.

01:52.695 --> 01:58.243
Uh, listen, I want what they took
from my family.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.286
I've got a name and a number.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.246
Vera!

02:02.997 --> 02:03.832
Don't.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.000
Keep your head down.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.461
Do you want to wind up like your mother?

02:09.838 --> 02:10.713
Sorry.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.382
What do I know?

02:12.882 --> 02:14.300
Maybe they're all fine.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.011
Maybe you'll get a letter.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.640
They're already gone?

02:21.182 --> 02:23.059
If you're going to crack up…

02:25.019 --> 02:26.479
stay away from me!

02:32.110 --> 02:33.987
Welcome to fucking Budapest.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.867
At least my Hungarian is getting better.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.577
All right.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.303
We're home, Grandma.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.771
Oh.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.648
Unlocked.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.352
Cuckoo-cuckoo!

03:48.561 --> 03:51.397
-Cuckoo-cuckoo!
-There a fucking rooster in here?

03:52.398 --> 03:53.274
Cuckoo?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.698
Cuckoo-cuckoo!

04:20.885 --> 04:21.761
Hey.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.515
Hey! Do I know you?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.059
Shh!

04:33.106 --> 04:34.565
Holy shit.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.987
Are you just going
to stand there like a princess?

04:40.238 --> 04:41.114
Come on!

04:48.538 --> 04:49.872
For strength.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.666
Ah.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.547
You're Delia.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.257
Fucking A.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.135
You never change.
Even backwards.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.930
Thanks, man.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.895
You speak English yet?

05:12.979 --> 05:15.398
Shh, Vera! I know, I know.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.484
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

05:23.156 --> 05:29.245
Delia, do you know anything
about where this, uh, gold train is?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.080
What train?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.373
It's warehouse, not train.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.376
Everything Nazis stole
is in warehouse. Everything.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.753
I know nothing of train.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.463
Holy shit, of course.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.174
The Russians aren't close enough yet.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.176
Sons of bitches!

05:44.427 --> 05:46.137
We should learn Russian next.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.849
Eh, easy on the Russian.
I shouldn't even speak Hungarian.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.518
Look, everything in this warehouse

05:52.602 --> 05:55.521
will be put on a train and moved west
once the Russians get here.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.900
I'm here to intercept that shit
before that train arrives.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.902
The Russians will save Budapest.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.821
Ah. Well…

06:07.033 --> 06:11.788
Uh, where exactly
is this so-called warehouse?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.960
Should we go
to Café Gerbeaud?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.212
Café Gerbeaud?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.421
That sounds lovely!

06:20.505 --> 06:23.132
Oh look, here comes a "widow."

06:24.050 --> 06:28.304
You know,
they're dressing like widows now.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.433
You can't tell who's a widow
and who's a Jew rat.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.648
Psst, little girl!
What are you looking for?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.776
Sorry, I'm lost.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.695
Is this Café Gerbeaud?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.239
You're wearing that to Gerbeaud?

06:47.657 --> 06:48.491
What?

06:49.534 --> 06:50.785
You're a pretty girl.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.662
You want to wear something special?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.623
You don't have to be a widow
every night, right?

06:56.290 --> 06:57.458
Jewelry.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.584
Hats.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.627
Furs.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.212
All from the Jews.

07:03.673 --> 07:08.010
I guess it's never too early
for Christmas shopping.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.764
Ugh.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.309
Holy fuck.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.187
Yeah.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.231
Jesus.

07:46.257 --> 07:49.552
Get an
extra place setting. You never know.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.105
Excuse me.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.231
Uh, hi.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.400
Have you seen
any numbers on this stuff?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.359
Sorry?

08:06.110 --> 08:08.154
There should be parcel numbers.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.823
They told the families
they'd keep all their things together.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.450
Why does it matter to you?

08:13.701 --> 08:17.622
I just want to make sure
I'm getting a full set.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.624
So… You're welcome.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.673
So fucked up.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.996
Fuck.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.457
Fuck my life, come on.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.230
Huh.

09:39.745 --> 09:40.663
Thirty-four.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.917
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.962
One-four-zero-seven.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.595
Seven. Seven-eight-two-two. Mmm.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.473
Huh.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.193
Fucking meth heads.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.995
One-four-zero-seven, baby. Come on.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.807
Oh Jesus!

12:10.521 --> 12:12.857
Got an arm like Darryl Strawberry.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.912
Motherfucking things.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.087
X marks the spot.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.348
Stay there.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.661
Oh fuck.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.292
Fuck.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.756
Jesus fucking Christ.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.014
Take it easy.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.568
Hello. How are you, sir? Uh…

13:39.652 --> 13:40.694
Excuse me…

13:40.778 --> 13:43.280
"The eagle does not catch flies."

13:43.364 --> 13:44.240
Latin.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.826
Welcome. I hope we can be
a comfort in your time of grief.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.078
And when you think about it,
is there any other time?

13:49.161 --> 13:51.747
Uh, so I'm looking
for a Father László Kiss.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.998
Right behind you.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.708
Ah, lucky me.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.003
Ah! Great.
The man of the hour, in the flesh.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.588
So my research shows that you are

13:59.672 --> 14:01.590
a very decent person
with an impressive lifeline,

14:01.674 --> 14:05.010
who has a soft spot for Jews,
aka "Kugel fever."

14:05.094 --> 14:06.929
I'm sorry. Who are you?

14:07.012 --> 14:10.057
Ah, I don't think
you want to peel that onion.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.517
Call me Vera.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.561
You are welcome to pray

14:14.270 --> 14:15.855
in our house of worship.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.274
Thanks for your time.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.487
Nice guy. Uh…

14:23.571 --> 14:24.780
I'm "tolerated."

14:24.864 --> 14:25.698
Right?

14:25.781 --> 14:29.827
People say "welcome"
when they mean "tolerated."

14:29.910 --> 14:31.161
Anyway, uh…

14:31.245 --> 14:32.997
I need you to mail this map

14:33.080 --> 14:35.499
to Vera Peschauer Vulvokov
in New York City.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.001
I thought you were Vera.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.919
After the war.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.588
After the war?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.798
Look, I saw rocks on your grave,

14:42.882 --> 14:46.385
and anyone who's seen<i> Schindler's List</i>

14:46.468 --> 14:48.387
knows that means you're a mensch.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.140
Then again, is it Spielberg's best film?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.183
No. That's the first episode of<i> Columbo.</i>

14:53.267 --> 14:54.476
Who can say?

14:55.477 --> 14:56.937
You saw my grave?

14:57.521 --> 14:58.898
Ah, yeah.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.858
You believe me?

15:00.941 --> 15:04.737
Before you answer, remember,
you believe in "transubstantiation."

15:07.615 --> 15:09.116
I believe you.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.285
Do you trust me?

15:11.368 --> 15:13.329
I do. Do you trust me?

15:14.455 --> 15:15.581
Credo.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.417
-Hold on.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.046
-Not here.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.300
I'll meet you at Keleti Station,
under the clock at 8:00 p.m.?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.928
8:00 p.m., under the clock.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.722
Was I old?

15:32.431 --> 15:33.933
When you died?

15:34.016 --> 15:34.850
Super old.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.935
Oh…

15:36.018 --> 15:37.311
…and married.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.314
Married.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.544
Shit.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.060
All right, László.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.395
Fuck this.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.566
Ow!

16:25.401 --> 16:26.610
Shit.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.613
Fuck. Shit.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.871
Vera Peschauer. Vera Peschauer!

16:38.455 --> 16:40.124
Vera Peschauer!

16:40.207 --> 16:43.002
Mail for Vera Peschauer!

16:43.085 --> 16:44.336
Vera!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.423
Vera Peschauer!

16:48.298 --> 16:49.800
Vera Peschauer!

16:49.883 --> 16:52.678
Mail for Vera Peschauer!

16:52.761 --> 16:54.346
Vera Peschauer!

16:54.930 --> 16:56.223
Fuck.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.224
-Hey!

16:57.307 --> 17:00.477
Hey! Why are you running?
Come back, miss!

17:02.062 --> 17:03.981
Mail it after the war.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.734
-This'll change everything for my family.
-Where are you going?

17:06.817 --> 17:07.735
Please!

17:07.818 --> 17:08.944
It's not safe.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.195
Just send it!

17:31.383 --> 17:32.426
Delia.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.114
Ooh!

17:54.198 --> 17:57.826
-Vera.

17:58.827 --> 17:59.870
Sit down.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.539
You are doing the right thing.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.540
Yeah.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.584
I'm doing the right thing.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.796
I think I finally
fucking changed what happened.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.633
Which would change what happens to Vera,
which will change what happens to Nora,

18:12.716 --> 18:14.426
which will change what happens to me.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.012
I mean, it goes all the way
down the line like turtles.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.807
You don't have to explain yourself.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.726
Eh. Eh.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.020
Eh, let me hold it. Come on.

18:25.104 --> 18:25.979
It's okay.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.943
-Mmm.
-All right. All right.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
Fuck.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.869
Hold your bag tight.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.373
These fucking
animal muggers.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.415
Fucking metro.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.084
Yeah, fucking metro. I know.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.294
The appraisers
are right by the hospital.

18:49.378 --> 18:53.882
All right. Appraisers,
and then the fucking stock market grew.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.097
This is the security for her.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.600
Her husband died.
She's a single mother now.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.438
-This is unbelievable.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.190
Fucking really did it, huh?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.822
Hey, buddy, sir?

19:16.905 --> 19:21.368
Uh, please with the yawning, all right?
A little respect for the butterfly effect.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.579
<i>You left something in here.</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:33.046
<i>Bonds? Coins? Cash?</i>

19:33.130 --> 19:34.006
Oh yeah.

19:34.798 --> 19:35.632
Krugerrands.

19:39.011 --> 19:39.928
Wait.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.159
I don't want Krugerrands.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.622
Vera, we discussed this.
It's the most stable currency.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.956
Remember the pengo?

20:09.249 --> 20:10.167
Krugerrands.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.463
I didn't do all this

20:15.172 --> 20:19.468
just to end up
with the same fucking Krugerrands.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.136
<i>Krugerrands. Is there a problem here?</i>

20:21.220 --> 20:24.598
It's okay.
It's just, uh, this means a lot to her.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.309
In the war, she lost everything.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.145
One day, she got a map from a stranger,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.439
a priest, sending the mail.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.649
Went back to Budapest.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.569
In the wall of a sewer,
was her father's watch,

20:37.653 --> 20:40.280
these earrings, the opal brooch.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.492
Uh, how did such things happen?

20:43.575 --> 20:46.453
But what good is jewelry for us now?

20:46.536 --> 20:49.039
So we exchange for gold.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.040
Krugerrands.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.001
<i>I can only hear you</i>
<i>when you press the button.</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:54.378
Bitch-face man.

20:55.462 --> 20:59.716
<i>So 150 coins</i>
<i>at 33.50 an ounce comes to…</i>

21:02.344 --> 21:05.514
$5325.

21:05.597 --> 21:09.559
Now,
if those monsters ever come back,

21:09.643 --> 21:11.520
we have exit strategy.

21:11.603 --> 21:15.274
You never know what can happen.
That's what it means, this money,

21:16.149 --> 21:17.985
a way out.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.198
That's all there is, a way out.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.005
Mom!
I taught myself the choreography.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.479
Uh, come over here.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.108
-Hi.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.490
Uh,

22:46.573 --> 22:49.201
so Mommy's gonna tell you a little story,

22:49.284 --> 22:50.452
and

22:50.535 --> 22:52.579
it's not gonna mean anything to you.

22:52.662 --> 22:55.415
But hey, it's just a story, right?

22:56.625 --> 23:00.253
Turns out, I was wrong about time.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.172
You know how that goes. Uh…

23:02.798 --> 23:06.259
See, I thought that
I could change things for us, you know?

23:06.343 --> 23:07.552
If I just

23:08.595 --> 23:09.846
went back far enough.

23:09.930 --> 23:10.764
Uh…

23:11.306 --> 23:15.394
And then, turns out,
I couldn't change anything at all.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.439
So I-- I can only do
what was always done, so…

23:20.941 --> 23:22.025
Is this a riddle?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.945
Fifteen years from now,

23:25.028 --> 23:27.280
you'll get the idea to steal this gold.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.824
I'll lose it.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.159
In trying to right that wrong,

23:31.868 --> 23:34.246
I'll only end up bringing you back

23:34.329 --> 23:36.915
the same gold
that you steal 15 years from now.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.167
Okay.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.046
It's the dance of the tarantula.

23:43.130 --> 23:43.964
Great.

23:46.007 --> 23:46.842
Watch me.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.302
Tell you this,

23:50.137 --> 23:52.681
time's got a real
sick sense of humor, Nora.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.475
We have to keep
stomping our feet

23:55.559 --> 23:58.019
so the tarantula poison
doesn't go to our hearts.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.105
You can't have that.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.440
It's too much poison.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.824
You're such a good dancer, Mom.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.201
Come on, Mommy. Dance with me.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.652
I'm gonna get some chicken.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.825
I'm gonna keep this.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.253
-Let's get out of this car.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.256
What the fuck did you say?

25:09.216 --> 25:10.467
Just let it go.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.271
-Be careful.
-You okay, Nora?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.274
Be careful, the baby.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.276
Come sit down,
take a load off.

25:28.777 --> 25:29.611
Nora.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.820
We're almost there.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.322
Nora.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.883
i just-- I just passed you.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.018
Nora.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.983
Yeah, okay.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.026
Fuck!

26:51.109 --> 26:52.444
The baby is coming!

26:52.527 --> 26:54.154
-It's okay, Nora.
-Ah! Yeah!
