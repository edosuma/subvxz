You were the architect
of this Charade.

41:40.460 --> 41:43.520
Cost me my daughter,
and, up until now,

41:43.560 --> 41:46.529
my granddaughter
and my great-granddaughter.

41:47.270 --> 41:48.669
What did you tell her?

41:48.700 --> 41:50.736
She was going to find out
sooner or later.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.762
I know the broad strokes.
I know who I am.

41:53.810 --> 41:55.801
I need to know the details

41:55.840 --> 41:59.674
of exactly what you've thrown
out there into the ether.

41:59.710 --> 42:02.474
What you need to do
is to thank me

42:02.520 --> 42:04.442
for putting
all of this behind you.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.710
Is that what
you think you did?

42:06.750 --> 42:08.889
Because I think you may
have made things worse.

42:10.290 --> 42:11.848
SO, from the start,

42:11.890 --> 42:14.620
what did you tell her,
word for word?
