(CLOCK TICKING)

02:34.325 --> 02:36.576
You sneaky so-and-so.

02:40.565 --> 02:43.085
Oh, you poor silly bastard.

02:43.185 --> 02:44.162
(CHESS PIECE MOVES)

02:44.262 --> 02:46.267
Are you ready for the waterfall?

02:49.841 --> 02:51.709
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Mr. Kressen?</i>

02:51.809 --> 02:54.212
Who dares to interrupt
this monumental battle?

02:54.312 --> 02:56.578
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Joy Andrews is here.</i>

02:56.914 --> 02:59.450
The reporter from High Tech Quarterly.

02:59.550 --> 03:02.054
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Joy Andrews. The reporter from...</i>

03:02.154 --> 03:05.887
High Tech Quarterly, yes.
Go ahead and send her up. Check.

03:12.463 --> 03:14.095
DAVID KRESSEN: Check.

03:16.033 --> 03:17.626
Check.

03:18.552 --> 03:21.269
And mate.

03:40.224 --> 03:42.323
(ELECTRONIC DING)

03:52.970 --> 03:56.407
JOY: I think it's putting it mildly
to say you're a bit of a mystery.

03:56.507 --> 03:59.211
Most people don't graduate MIT
with a BS in Computer science...

03:59.311 --> 04:02.678
...and Masters in Mechanical
Engineering at the age of 20.

04:02.778 --> 04:05.847
- Nineteen.
- Nineteen.

04:06.284 --> 04:08.556
And those that do
usually join a think-tank.

04:08.656 --> 04:12.024
Or apply their knowledge in broad,
greater good ways.

04:12.124 --> 04:13.688
I get that.

04:13.824 --> 04:18.195
But when a Simon Castle presents you with
an opportunity, it's very hard to turn down.

04:18.295 --> 04:20.865
It's even harder to negotiate terms.

04:20.965 --> 04:24.465
Right. And why all the secrecy?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.685
I mean, you've been a recluse.

04:27.104 --> 04:29.741
- I wouldn't say it's that bad.
- No?

04:29.841 --> 04:34.275
I basically have a blank check
to explore any field I want.

04:35.078 --> 04:39.014
This workshop has been like
an intellectual Darwin bubble.

04:39.116 --> 04:43.988
The work done here has progressed with
very little input from outside academia.

04:44.308 --> 04:47.345
The world of academic science
can be a little stagnant.

04:47.445 --> 04:50.020
Ideas tend to be reactive.

04:50.120 --> 04:55.044
Back and forth and you get these
little ego-driven Eddy currents...

04:55.144 --> 04:57.619
...that slow overall advancement.

04:58.289 --> 05:02.460
People focus on minutia
just to get a paper published...

05:02.560 --> 05:06.810
...with very little desire to be
the first to the next big thing.

05:07.798 --> 05:10.725
When Castle started Castrole
Computing from his garage...

05:10.825 --> 05:12.987
- Mm?
- ...he had a vision...

05:13.087 --> 05:17.588
...that wasn't beholden to any previous
notions of what a computer system could do.

05:18.909 --> 05:24.328
This, Workspace 18,
is the modern day application of that.

05:24.981 --> 05:29.466
To give one person unfettered freedom
and unlimited access...

05:30.166 --> 05:32.323
...to do something amazing.

05:32.423 --> 05:35.062
Well, it looks like
you're drinking the Kool-Aid.

05:36.894 --> 05:38.709
I guess so.

05:40.697 --> 05:45.516
Everything I've built over the last decade
was cooked up on this table.

05:52.976 --> 05:57.724
- That's a lot of Terabytes.
- Peta... bytes.

06:01.735 --> 06:04.547
- JOY: What's that?
- Feel it.

06:07.891 --> 06:11.728
- It's warm.
- It's realistic, durable skin substitute.

06:11.828 --> 06:16.233
It can actually generate and emit heat
signatures that match body temperature.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.436
That patent's already through.

06:18.536 --> 06:23.253
Within three years, that will be the gold
standard covering for prostatic limbs.

06:27.478 --> 06:29.326
Feel that.

06:30.648 --> 06:33.217
- It's light.
- Aerated titanium.

06:33.317 --> 06:37.321
Has the same physical kinematic properties
and weight balance of human bone.

06:37.421 --> 06:39.390
We bubble argon through it.

06:39.490 --> 06:42.507
But tensile strength
like an airplane fuselage.

06:45.996 --> 06:50.535
The eye is probably the single most
complex component of the human body...

06:50.635 --> 06:54.339
...but with this camera, we're able to
convert a hemispheric, fisheye image...

06:54.439 --> 06:57.725
...into a planar representation
that allows a computer to see it...

06:57.825 --> 06:59.826
...in a way that is analogous
to the way we do.

06:59.976 --> 07:02.548
- So you're talking about robotics?
- Bingo.

07:02.648 --> 07:05.516
I used to study robotics.
Grad school type stuff.

07:05.616 --> 07:08.652
I know. That's why Castle
chose you for this article series.

07:08.752 --> 07:12.269
He really enjoyed your paper
on Subsumption Architecture.

07:13.023 --> 07:15.125
That was my dissertation.

07:15.225 --> 07:18.596
My unfinished dissertation.
I never technically defended it.

07:18.696 --> 07:20.997
Doesn't mean it wasn't on Castle's radar.

07:21.097 --> 07:25.513
Maybe he had you in mind for a workspace
of your own. Once upon a time.

07:28.805 --> 07:31.975
Look, these are amazing feats.

07:32.075 --> 07:34.613
But if you know half as much
about my work as you seem to...

07:34.713 --> 07:37.914
...then you know that this stuff
isn't really new to me.

07:38.014 --> 07:40.619
I've done a bunch of pieces
on emerging tech...

07:40.719 --> 07:44.287
...and I tend to be my editors
go-to for all things robotic.

07:44.387 --> 07:49.094
I get why I'm here, I just don't get why I
need a full week of access to interview you.

07:49.194 --> 07:52.442
It won't take me that long to write
about what I've seen here today.

07:53.297 --> 07:55.179
Follow me.

07:57.801 --> 07:59.771
- DAVID: Adam.
- I hope I didn't offend you.

07:59.871 --> 08:03.241
These things are amazing. The eye especially
will make for a fascinating piece.

08:03.341 --> 08:05.588
DAVID: Don't worry, it's fine.

08:16.987 --> 08:21.192
- Why don't you talk to Joy for a bit.
- Oh, no, that's okay. I don't need to.

08:21.692 --> 08:24.174
Trust me, talk to Adam.

08:34.037 --> 08:36.574
JOY: So how long have you been
David's assistant?

08:36.674 --> 08:40.111
- Seven years.
- Oh, wow. What exactly does that entail?

08:40.211 --> 08:43.614
We plan and manufacture
the components for our work.

08:43.714 --> 08:46.144
- And you participate in the assembly?
- Yes.

08:46.244 --> 08:49.821
Okay. So you have a background
in mechanical engineering and coding?

08:49.921 --> 08:53.080
- ADAM: Yes.
- Okay. Graduate study?

08:57.194 --> 08:59.330
Okay. No graduate study.

08:59.430 --> 09:02.622
- Adam, do you have a last name?
- Kressen.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.950
- So you're related?
- Yes.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.353
Yes, we are.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.531
Cool.

09:16.313 --> 09:18.316
Can you think of anything that would help...

09:18.416 --> 09:21.729
...prevent development erased
condition in a system I'm designing.

09:22.319 --> 09:27.123
Utilization of a carnal map would allow
for simplification of Boolean expression.

09:27.223 --> 09:30.027
And subsequently result
in detection and elimination...

09:30.127 --> 09:32.332
...of erase hazard prior to occurrence...

09:32.432 --> 09:35.512
...as well as minimization
of other involved functions.

09:35.612 --> 09:39.817
That sounds about right. Thank you, Adam.
You're a programming Rain Man.

09:40.570 --> 09:42.607
The remote automated information manager...

09:42.707 --> 09:45.643
...is the proprietary publishing
platform of America Online.

09:45.743 --> 09:49.013
It's actual coding is at the highest
levels of corporate security.

09:49.113 --> 09:52.862
I was never involved in its programming.
Where did you hear that?

09:54.685 --> 09:57.567
I was actually referring
to Dustin Hoffman.

10:01.909 --> 10:05.152
Adam, could you wait here a second
while I talk with David?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.497
What?

10:27.918 --> 10:30.188
Clearly something's up with him.
What's the deal?

10:30.288 --> 10:33.703
- What do you think the deal is?
- David, don't waste my time.

10:34.325 --> 10:38.061
This kid the next big thing?
Some Asperger's cousin of yours...

10:38.161 --> 10:41.665
...ready to get all Good Will Hunting
on coding and change the world?

10:41.765 --> 10:43.485
Oh, my God.

10:44.341 --> 10:45.603
What?

10:45.703 --> 10:48.164
You're not doing a piece on the eye...

10:48.705 --> 10:53.557
...or the bone, or the lab,
or my prodigy programmer.

10:54.444 --> 10:58.132
- Well, not directly, anyway.
- I don't get it.

10:58.849 --> 11:00.283
Look...

11:00.383 --> 11:03.187
...Adam is the amalgam...

11:03.287 --> 11:07.320
...of everything you've seen here and more.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.974
I made him.

11:11.862 --> 11:16.368
He is the most convincing
Artificial Intelligence...

11:16.768 --> 11:18.615
...ever created.

11:20.771 --> 11:23.039
Do you know what the best part is?

11:23.139 --> 11:27.100
The best part of all this
is that he fooled you.

11:27.744 --> 11:30.413
You, of all people...

11:30.513 --> 11:33.427
...with a graduate study in robotics no less.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.166
Of course, you technically did drop out.

11:37.821 --> 11:41.305
Do you still think a whole week
will be enough time for your article?

11:45.679 --> 11:48.461
JOY:
It felt like he was rubbing it in my face.

11:48.932 --> 11:53.404
No. No. Yeah, I'll admit,
I was probably a little sensitive...

11:53.504 --> 11:58.106
...after the nonchalant name drop of
my failed doctorate. It's my baggage.

11:59.910 --> 12:02.759
It doesn't mean
he wasn't a smug fuck, though.

12:03.814 --> 12:06.829
Yeah, I got to admit,
it's pretty intriguing.

12:08.919 --> 12:12.335
Oh, come on, let me bring
the drama out of the moment.

12:12.989 --> 12:14.725
Humanoid AI?

12:14.825 --> 12:18.563
And, Caleb, let me tell you, on cursory
interaction, you cannot tell at all.

12:18.663 --> 12:20.544
Not at all.

12:22.065 --> 12:25.315
I... I was kicking myself when I found out.

12:31.074 --> 12:34.557
Can I sleep on it? I've got to ruminate.

12:35.812 --> 12:38.950
Having David fucking Kressen
intellectually judge me for a week...

12:39.050 --> 12:41.564
...is not my idea of a good time.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.800
Uh-uh.

12:47.057 --> 12:50.107
No, don't tell Aubrey just yet.
Can I let you know?

12:50.878 --> 12:52.459
Yeah.

12:53.030 --> 12:54.591
Okay.

12:55.229 --> 12:57.067
Okay, bye.

12:58.234 --> 12:59.782
Bye.

13:06.810 --> 13:08.892
(SHUDDERS)

13:40.310 --> 13:43.760
- ADAM: May I interrupt?
- What's on your mind?

13:44.247 --> 13:46.296
(PULLS CHAIR BACK)

13:50.854 --> 13:53.169
What if she doesn't like us?

13:53.589 --> 13:55.639
What's not to like?

13:57.027 --> 13:59.329
Look, I know it's tough.

13:59.429 --> 14:03.480
It's been you and me for so long, but you
were not made to be locked up forever.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.914
It's time to share you with the world.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.721
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.091
EGBOK.

14:17.514 --> 14:21.398
- "Everything's going to be okay."
- You know it.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.372
Do you think she's pretty?

14:31.461 --> 14:34.065
Her hair is nice. Good facial symmetry.

14:34.165 --> 14:38.669
Delicate features. Nice fashion sense.
Yes, I do. I think she's pretty.

14:38.769 --> 14:40.650
What do you think?

14:41.271 --> 14:43.474
I think she's very pretty.

14:44.074 --> 14:48.091
Well, that's good to know.
You have impeccable taste.

15:15.271 --> 15:16.887
Interesting.

15:20.443 --> 15:24.927
I have a pretty static chess rating.
2180 Elo. Give or take.

15:25.481 --> 15:29.999
It's strong, but it would probably
give me some problems on a national level.

15:31.854 --> 15:36.860
When Adam and I started playing,
he was around an 800, a novice.

15:36.960 --> 15:41.498
But after a couple of weeks
with a game every morning...

15:41.598 --> 15:44.247
...he's sitting at a 1700.

15:50.173 --> 15:52.422
Thought you'd go for that.

15:54.211 --> 15:57.694
Checkmate. See, I sacrificed my queen.

15:58.148 --> 16:00.655
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.

16:01.051 --> 16:04.587
It's a big a event,
but here it's a distraction.

16:04.687 --> 16:07.904
Who needs a queen
when you win without one.

16:09.892 --> 16:12.896
Always be focused
on your primary objective.

16:12.996 --> 16:17.047
Your lack of focus on what's important
made you miss the big picture.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.649
And that made you lose the game.

16:23.806 --> 16:27.023
Make sure he doesn't beat
himself up too much over it.

16:45.328 --> 16:47.209
JOY: Are you okay?

16:48.065 --> 16:50.347
He had me beat six moves ago.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.336
JOY: Excuse me?

16:52.436 --> 16:56.653
With a Knight threat, I would have had
the castle and then mate in two.

16:56.773 --> 17:00.823
He chose not to do that.
He let the game go six moves longer...

17:01.477 --> 17:05.275
...so that he could beat me with
a queen sacrifice. Why do that...

17:06.183 --> 17:08.901
...if the primary objective is to win?

17:10.053 --> 17:12.804
Maybe the primary objective wasn't to win.

17:13.124 --> 17:15.458
Then what was the primary objective?

17:15.558 --> 17:19.806
To teach you. It's a flashier move,
and he did have a point to make.

17:22.199 --> 17:26.505
Perhaps he chose... to make me look foolish.

17:27.871 --> 17:30.229
Perhaps specifically...

17:31.041 --> 17:34.205
<i>...making me look foolish
was his primary objective.</i>

17:34.945 --> 17:37.360
JOY:
<i>I don't think you should read into it.</i>

17:37.614 --> 17:39.216
<i>It's a just a game.</i>

17:39.316 --> 17:43.387
No, it's a learning exercise. Strategy
is the means to the win which is the end.

17:43.487 --> 17:48.666
He abandoned a surefire win
in order to attempt to humiliate me.

17:52.695 --> 17:54.478
That doesn't fit...

17:54.578 --> 17:58.313
...within the confines of programming.

17:58.902 --> 18:00.972
JOY: <i>People do things
for different reasons, Adam.</i>

18:01.072 --> 18:03.937
<i>It's programming but in a different sense.</i>

18:07.577 --> 18:09.291
Hey.

18:23.526 --> 18:25.241
Sorry.

18:26.263 --> 18:27.832
Why?

18:27.932 --> 18:31.513
The way you looked at my hand. I thought,
maybe, you didn't like to be touched.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.891
I don't have much
of a frame of reference...

18:44.114 --> 18:46.129
...for being touched.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.203
So...

18:51.144 --> 18:53.376
...no apology is necessary.

19:16.913 --> 19:18.795
You look busy.

19:19.615 --> 19:23.420
- How long have you been standing there?
- Just long enough to watch you in action.

19:24.387 --> 19:26.390
You know you don't really
have to dress up for us.

19:26.490 --> 19:29.960
- This is a workshop, not a job interview.
- Okay.

19:30.060 --> 19:33.644
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I mean, you look great, really.

19:34.264 --> 19:36.900
I just don't want you to get
your nice clothes all dirty.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.215
Wear what makes you comfortable.

19:40.503 --> 19:44.274
- I see why Castle invested in you.
- What? This?

19:44.374 --> 19:47.678
This is just the technicians stuff.
It's nowhere near Adam's level.

19:47.778 --> 19:52.382
His physiology recreates the seven
degrees of freedom of a human arm.

19:52.482 --> 19:56.186
This bucket of bolts is just
the test subject for the software.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.422
Anyone with a steady hand
can screw it together.

19:59.522 --> 20:02.338
Not that impressive
as far as I'm concerned.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.790
Now this...

20:04.890 --> 20:07.291
...this is what's impressive.

20:08.431 --> 20:13.036
The algorithms, the naturalistic coding,
that's what Castle invested in.

20:13.636 --> 20:17.857
Most of my time spent here
is perfecting programs like that one.

20:17.957 --> 20:21.355
When I was at MIT,
I designed a robotic hand...

20:21.455 --> 20:24.448
...that could crush a cue ball into dust...

20:24.548 --> 20:27.350
...but hold a butterfly wing
without hurting it.

20:27.450 --> 20:29.452
The mechanics don't matter.

20:29.552 --> 20:33.424
What matters is how sophisticated
the input sensors are.

20:33.524 --> 20:37.060
The key for that hand
wasn't in its movement...

20:37.160 --> 20:39.396
...but the way it moved.

20:39.496 --> 20:44.468
When Castle offered me this workspace,
he said it was the movement of that hand...

20:44.568 --> 20:47.837
...that made him feel
there was true intelligence behind it.

20:47.937 --> 20:50.941
He gave me a rousing speech
I can't remember much of now...

20:51.041 --> 20:53.876
...except for the part where
he told me he would, quote...

20:53.976 --> 20:57.982
"Fund my journey through
the uncanny valley." End Quote.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.363
- Masahiro Mori.
- The man himself.

21:01.784 --> 21:05.688
Well, that was Castle's goal. And once
I heard that, I was as good as his.

21:05.788 --> 21:09.861
Most mech techs end up building things that
are for commercial or industrial purposes...

21:09.961 --> 21:12.174
...which is really a shame.

21:12.529 --> 21:14.665
Robotics is about artistry.

21:14.765 --> 21:18.581
I aspire to be more like Vincent
Van Gogh than Henry Ford.

21:19.201 --> 21:22.839
AI computers have always been made
to compete with humans...

21:22.939 --> 21:27.724
...be it chess, ping pong,
calculations, etcetera.

21:28.344 --> 21:32.183
I want to make a machine that lives
independently alongside humans...

21:32.283 --> 21:34.531
...without feeling the need to compete.

21:41.124 --> 21:42.893
(PING PONG BALL TAPPING)

21:42.993 --> 21:44.748
DAVID: <i>What did you think of Adam?</i>

21:44.848 --> 21:46.096
(LAUGHS)

21:46.296 --> 21:50.112
He's amazing.
It's amazing what you've done.

21:51.868 --> 21:54.150
I can actually see him thinking.

21:55.171 --> 21:57.108
And his answers are so thought out...

21:57.208 --> 22:00.477
...not pre-programmed,
and with quick delivery.

22:00.577 --> 22:03.292
His movements
are naturalistic and precise.

22:03.980 --> 22:06.029
Castle's right. It...

22:08.057 --> 22:10.183
...it's as if there's intelligence behind it.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.854
(SMASHING)

23:25.405 --> 23:28.431
- JOY: Shouldn't you check on that?
- Not at all.

23:28.781 --> 23:32.366
Adam has repeatedly showed himself
to be extremely reliable.

23:35.856 --> 23:37.557
What's that smell?

23:37.657 --> 23:39.539
JOY: Oh, my God!

23:40.227 --> 23:42.108
Watch it!

23:42.628 --> 23:45.732
- Don't just stand there, grab some towels.
- JOY: What is that?

23:45.832 --> 23:48.768
DAVID: Kind of like a cybernetic stomach.

23:48.868 --> 23:51.038
Although not really,
it's not an analog or anything.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.974
- JOY: So it serves as a power source?
- DAVID: It's not like Mr. Fusion.

23:55.374 --> 23:57.044
(LAUGHS) A Back to the Future fan.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.647
DAVID: Not only does that tech not exist,
it never will, it doesn't need to.

24:00.747 --> 24:03.017
JOY: So he doesn't need to
consume an energy source?

24:03.117 --> 24:05.686
- DAVID: Nope.
- JOY: So, why a stomach?

24:05.786 --> 24:08.405
DAVID: Robotics of the Van Gogh level
isn't about hyper function.

24:08.505 --> 24:11.888
So much as the accurate imitation
of normal function.

24:12.442 --> 24:16.507
A perfect AI should be completely
indistinguishable from a human.

24:17.197 --> 24:20.601
So it needs to be able to at least
mimic certain things...

24:20.701 --> 24:24.098
...that would be vital
to human behavior, like...

24:24.198 --> 24:26.339
- Eating.
- Exactly.

24:27.507 --> 24:31.012
The problem then becomes
how to digest components of food...

24:31.112 --> 24:32.950
...in a fashion that zero sums.

24:33.380 --> 24:36.450
If we can do that, no leftovers.

24:36.550 --> 24:39.921
No goop. Looks like
you're a ways off of that.

24:40.021 --> 24:44.615
Well, kind of. We're road testing
substances. Proteins easily degrade.

24:45.425 --> 24:48.558
That unit there processes food
through chambered baths...

24:48.658 --> 24:51.284
...of synthetic hymotrips in an elastice.

24:51.384 --> 24:54.502
And there's another chamber with
a newly discovered proloanaprotiese...

24:54.602 --> 24:56.984
...that just demolishes gluten.

24:57.504 --> 25:01.908
- But is it really necessary?
- For functionality? No.

25:02.008 --> 25:06.646
But what is the point if not to create the
most finely constructed illusion possible?

25:48.752 --> 25:52.493
(GASPS) Oh, Je... Jesus! Adam, hi.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.395
- You scared me.
- I am sorry.

25:55.495 --> 25:59.166
No. No. No, no, no, it's okay.
I just... I got carried away writing.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.635
You guys make
for a pretty fascinating story.

26:02.735 --> 26:05.605
- Do you miss it?
- Miss what?

26:05.805 --> 26:10.744
Practical application. You obviously
have an aptitude for the material...

26:10.844 --> 26:13.446
...and obviously it makes you happy.

26:13.546 --> 26:17.751
Are you content simply to write about
the accomplishments of other people?

26:18.551 --> 26:20.633
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

26:21.887 --> 26:26.834
I've done my share of creating.
I took three open world cards to E3.

26:26.934 --> 26:31.399
And oversaw projects with budgets
comparable to Hollywood blockbusters.

26:31.499 --> 26:35.815
I've... I've got nothing to prove
to myself about my ability to succeed.

26:36.269 --> 26:38.618
<i>Aquaria 3</i> was awarded Game of the Year.

26:38.718 --> 26:40.273
Yeah.

26:40.373 --> 26:42.346
The royalty structure for such games...

26:42.446 --> 26:46.471
...must allow for a certain level
of financial stability.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.495
Yeah, I suppose.

26:51.384 --> 26:55.322
Do you need to work
to support yourself financially?

26:55.422 --> 26:57.670
No, I suppose I don't.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.207
Then why do you work?

27:00.794 --> 27:02.842
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

27:03.296 --> 27:05.358
(STAMMERS)

27:06.387 --> 27:08.660
I guess...

27:10.402 --> 27:13.853
I do. I guess I do miss it, Adam.

27:17.077 --> 27:18.625
Yeah.

27:20.520 --> 27:24.184
There's a part of me that wants
to go back and finish my doctorate...

27:24.284 --> 27:26.499
...and get a job somewhere and...

27:26.886 --> 27:28.688
(LAUGHS)

27:28.788 --> 27:31.691
...build something amazing
and change the world.

27:31.791 --> 27:35.963
But this is... this is high level science.
It's not riding a fucking bike.

27:36.063 --> 27:38.299
You can't just jump back in
after ten years.

27:38.399 --> 27:43.038
Especially when that ten years
houses an exponential tech explosion.

27:43.836 --> 27:46.319
- You're upset.
- No.

27:48.674 --> 27:50.844
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.

27:50.944 --> 27:54.553
I'm just curious as to why...

27:55.765 --> 27:58.647
...you're love of innovation is finite.

27:59.952 --> 28:02.589
If you love practical science...

28:02.689 --> 28:05.045
...why stop simply at admiring it?

28:05.625 --> 28:09.642
You're interaction ends
when you write your article.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.411
It ends...

28:15.761 --> 28:20.253
...with your appraisal
of new tech on a superficial level.

28:20.353 --> 28:24.002
Shouldn't love not have limitation?

28:24.377 --> 28:26.380
Shouldn't love of something...

28:26.880 --> 28:29.482
...so abstract as science...

28:29.582 --> 28:32.652
...cause you to want to bury yourself in it?

28:32.852 --> 28:34.573
To become one with it.

28:34.673 --> 28:37.658
Shouldn't it cause you to pursue it
as if there was nothing else in the world?

28:37.758 --> 28:41.028
How can you let that emotion be derailed
by something like fear of the unknown?

28:41.128 --> 28:42.251
Ow.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.918
ADAM: I apologize.

29:07.153 --> 29:09.001
What was that about?

29:10.723 --> 29:12.605
I don't know.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.786
ADAM: Are you awake?

29:28.675 --> 29:29.998
Yes.

29:31.335 --> 29:33.114
What's up?

29:36.001 --> 29:38.231
I don't think that Joy likes me.

29:40.353 --> 29:44.503
She is like a different person when she
talks to you. Why do you think that is?

29:45.691 --> 29:49.601
People are different in their
interactions with other people.

29:51.130 --> 29:53.200
I tend to look at everyone
as being surrounded...

29:53.300 --> 29:56.474
...by miniature electromagnetic fields...

29:56.574 --> 29:59.599
...that gradually break down
with repeated interaction.

30:00.740 --> 30:03.422
I'm curious to know more about her.

30:03.743 --> 30:06.024
So just ask her.

30:07.247 --> 30:10.439
- I did.
- And how'd that go?

30:10.539 --> 30:12.599
Not as anticipated.

30:14.086 --> 30:18.404
On some level, she regrets
abandoning her graduate study.

30:18.824 --> 30:22.463
She's proud of her achievement
in the field of entertainment gaming.

30:22.563 --> 30:26.099
But this does not supplant
some imagined ideologized future...

30:26.199 --> 30:29.071
...in which she is a successful roboticist.

30:30.587 --> 30:33.880
Well, that's good info.

30:37.142 --> 30:40.859
She also doesn't like
to be touched unexpectedly.

30:40.959 --> 30:43.229
Yeah, most people don't.

30:44.717 --> 30:49.537
I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure Joy will
like you more once she gets to know you.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.641
It...

30:55.395 --> 30:58.036
...it is nice to have someone...

30:59.232 --> 31:02.048
...to talk to who likes talking to me.

31:02.468 --> 31:04.683
Well, that's what I'm here for, buddy.

31:52.819 --> 31:56.469
Shiva The Destroyer. Deep in thought.

31:58.300 --> 32:00.739
Belonged to a former professor of mine.

32:01.561 --> 32:03.376
It's beautiful.

32:03.796 --> 32:06.281
Dr. Sing would always say...

32:06.699 --> 32:11.550
"That our conduct must be good,
so as not to waken the sleeping destroyer."

32:13.405 --> 32:17.623
When Shiva wakes, the world will tremble.

32:19.879 --> 32:22.128
Let's hope he doesn't wake up then.

32:24.149 --> 32:26.999
- Can I show you something?
- JOY: Mm-hmm.

32:37.629 --> 32:41.100
- JOY: I hate surprises.
- DAVID: Don't hate. Create.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.404
- What are you, a fortune cookie?
- Didn't I just say don't hate?

32:49.341 --> 32:51.157
I don't...

32:52.979 --> 32:55.027
These are my modules.

32:56.115 --> 32:57.996
Where did you get these?

32:58.718 --> 33:00.520
I made them.

33:00.620 --> 33:02.690
I stayed up last night assembling them...

33:02.790 --> 33:05.178
...and reprogramming
what code you created...

33:05.658 --> 33:07.473
...when you wrote this.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.936
Your dissertation.

33:10.036 --> 33:13.246
Adam seemed to think
you weren't quite done with robotics.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.982
So try again.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.341
(LAUGHS)

33:22.441 --> 33:25.244
Seems like cheating to have you
looking over my shoulder.

33:25.344 --> 33:28.281
This represents months of work to me,
you put it together in a night.

33:28.381 --> 33:32.135
Don't look to me for any help.
I'm here as the assistant only.

33:32.235 --> 33:34.333
(LAUGHS)

34:54.200 --> 34:56.282
(JOY LAUGHS)

34:58.538 --> 35:00.587
(LAUGHS)

35:15.555 --> 35:17.557
(JOY CHEERS)

35:18.257 --> 35:21.140
- Well done.
- Thank you.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.757
Sorry if we displaced you.

35:39.612 --> 35:41.627
It's all right.

35:42.364 --> 35:44.780
This work is not that important.

35:47.653 --> 35:50.023
- I helped.
- Hmm?

35:50.823 --> 35:53.360
I helped with the building
of your modules.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.613
Though, truth be told,
I didn't know they were your modules.

35:56.713 --> 35:58.732
David was very keen on doing the project.

35:58.832 --> 36:02.735
He wanted to surprise me.
It was very sweet and thoughtful.

36:02.835 --> 36:06.084
- And thanks for your help, Adam.
- You're welcome.

36:07.173 --> 36:09.942
Are those heat filaments for the skin?

36:10.042 --> 36:13.830
No, these are pesinium
vibo receptors. Multifunctional.

36:13.930 --> 36:16.965
- For sensation?
- Perhaps.

36:17.065 --> 36:19.298
Or micro charging.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.890
Small vibrations contain potential energy.

36:23.290 --> 36:27.262
If instead of damping this energy,
we store it in the capacitor.

36:27.362 --> 36:32.508
We can convert it to electrical energy
or a robot could become self-sufficient.

36:32.832 --> 36:36.415
And charge simply by picking up
environmental vibrations.

36:36.969 --> 36:39.805
DAVID:
Adam has to continuously process sound...

36:39.905 --> 36:43.175
...propuseptive information,
and visual stimuli.

36:43.275 --> 36:47.713
Takes 18 pedhertz of processing power
just to keep him standing.

36:47.813 --> 36:51.534
Plus, he is continuously accessing
his mainframe wirelessly...

36:51.634 --> 36:54.683
...to keep the hardware
in his body down to a minimum.

36:58.690 --> 37:00.739
(PULLS CHAIR BACK)

37:00.993 --> 37:03.008
You didn't tell me about this.

37:03.896 --> 37:05.732
It was a new idea.

37:06.232 --> 37:08.447
I wanted to surprise you.

37:08.701 --> 37:10.949
It's a good thought, Adam.

37:11.536 --> 37:14.206
It's great to see you
doing things on your own.

37:14.306 --> 37:16.876
That is really the nicest surprise.

37:17.376 --> 37:20.667
I've seen how well surprises
can be received.

37:27.987 --> 37:29.021
Holy shit!

37:29.121 --> 37:31.700
So you don't think
we're cooped up all the time.

37:32.491 --> 37:36.029
We have to run all our tolerances
for outdoor factors.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.363
Wind, sun and rain.

37:38.463 --> 37:41.467
So Castle made sure
we had an appropriate setup.

37:41.567 --> 37:45.871
JOY: It... it's a million dollar view, David.
It's more than appropriate.

37:46.471 --> 37:49.960
DAVID:
It really is nice. To see the city...

37:50.660 --> 37:52.958
...and all the people out there living.

37:55.614 --> 37:57.863
JOY: Do you miss it, being out there?

38:00.219 --> 38:03.588
DAVID: I don't really remember
being out there at all.

38:03.688 --> 38:06.137
So much of my life has been here.

38:07.359 --> 38:11.343
So, no, I don't miss it,
because I can't remember ever living it.

38:12.048 --> 38:15.564
- I must sound crazy.
- No, I get what you mean.

38:16.668 --> 38:19.772
I live so in the present that I can't remember
the happiest moments of my life...

38:19.872 --> 38:22.236
...as anything other than abstractions.

38:46.832 --> 38:49.114
It's like one big organism.

38:50.135 --> 38:53.486
All those small components
growing together.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.110
And the city grows...

38:58.015 --> 38:59.707
...evolves.

39:25.938 --> 39:28.232
Thank you for today. It was fun.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.423
- DAVID: It was my pleasure.
- Goodbye, Joy.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.726
Goodbye, Adam.

39:35.447 --> 39:38.697
(WHISPERING) Does he always say
goodbye to me in such a weird way?

39:45.357 --> 39:48.407
- (WHISPERING) Yes.
- Okay. Bye.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.195
What a nice girl.

39:56.295 --> 39:59.441
- What did she say to you?
- What do you think she said to me?

39:59.541 --> 40:02.825
I'm not in the mood for a Turing test.
What did she say?

40:03.275 --> 40:04.910
She thanked me for the gift I gave her...

40:05.010 --> 40:07.646
...then she said something
she only wanted me to hear.

40:07.746 --> 40:11.183
You clearly don't understand
that concept of a secret.

40:11.283 --> 40:13.452
I understand secrets.

40:13.852 --> 40:17.069
Well, then you shouldn't be
asking me to reveal it.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.841
I understand secrets.

40:42.281 --> 40:43.929
ADAM: Goodnight.

41:50.015 --> 41:52.097
(MOANING)

42:26.785 --> 42:29.401
- ADAM: Checkmate.
- Huh?

42:30.055 --> 42:31.867
Scholars mate.

42:31.967 --> 42:36.004
I know, I see it. Wow!

42:36.104 --> 42:39.110
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Miss Andrews has entered the facility.</i>

42:46.705 --> 42:48.808
Either I forgot how to play
chess last night...

42:48.908 --> 42:52.924
...or you just started exhibiting
a super, exponential learning curve.

42:53.024 --> 42:54.966
(BEEPING)

42:58.117 --> 43:00.198
My turn for a surprise.

43:02.087 --> 43:04.824
DAVID:
This is great. Such smooth gameplay.

43:04.924 --> 43:07.806
You can really pick out the improvements
on the existing <i>Aquarian.</i>

43:07.906 --> 43:11.731
JOY: Yeah. That's the reason
for the lag since <i>Aquaria 3.</i>

43:11.831 --> 43:13.966
The guys really wanted to get it perfect.

43:14.966 --> 43:18.904
Without you to write the code,
I don't see how that's a realistic goal.

43:19.004 --> 43:21.286
Gotta say, I appreciate the flattery.

43:21.646 --> 43:25.312
- When is this coming out?
- Realistically, next year.

43:25.412 --> 43:28.747
I had to pull every string I had
just to get a demo out of the studio.

43:28.847 --> 43:31.101
- Wow, I'm bad at this.
- But I figured since <i>Aquaria 3...</i>

43:31.201 --> 43:35.500
...is basically my baby,
I made a franchise out of it after all.

43:36.522 --> 43:39.458
If I can't pull those strings,
then nobody can.

43:39.558 --> 43:43.975
Plus I figured the intellectual Fort Knox
you guys live in is a pretty safe place.

43:44.763 --> 43:47.320
I can piggy back Castle's paranoia.

43:47.420 --> 43:49.247
Safe assumption.

43:50.869 --> 43:53.051
You think Adam would like to see this?

43:53.939 --> 43:56.776
No. Adam's working. He's fine.

43:56.876 --> 43:59.778
Besides, I think the controls
would probably be a little too fine...

43:59.878 --> 44:03.048
...for what he's capable of
without experience.

44:03.148 --> 44:05.831
He's much better with practiced movements.

44:40.852 --> 44:45.123
I don't know how you stand it
in here all the time.

44:45.223 --> 44:47.739
Getting a little cabin fever myself.

44:48.360 --> 44:52.275
We find this space neither confining
nor tedious. We work at our own pace.

44:52.375 --> 44:55.935
There is no clock to follow.
Everything we need is at our fingertips.

44:56.035 --> 44:57.249
I know.

44:58.603 --> 45:02.220
It's really admirable
the ability to focus that much.

45:02.874 --> 45:05.490
That singularity of purpose.

45:07.278 --> 45:10.069
Singularity of purpose. I like that.

45:10.169 --> 45:14.208
Well, that wouldn't exist if David
was out clubbing every night.

45:16.722 --> 45:18.803
Would you like to hold it?

45:24.062 --> 45:28.066
It's so light.
It's like holding a baby bird.

45:28.166 --> 45:32.171
A baby bird that cost over
a quarter of a million dollars.

45:32.271 --> 45:36.154
Okay, sufficiently freaked out.
Take it. Take It.

45:43.782 --> 45:45.398
What's that?

45:45.798 --> 45:47.564
ADAM: That is...

45:48.219 --> 45:50.102
...a surprise.

45:50.389 --> 45:52.791
JOY: Look who's being all secretive.

45:52.891 --> 45:55.872
- I understand secrets.
- JOY: It appears so.

45:58.363 --> 46:00.011
What?

46:00.565 --> 46:03.068
The camera itself
is a non-polarized image.

46:03.168 --> 46:06.664
Polarization will damp out
excess light contamination...

46:06.764 --> 46:08.741
...and facilitate edge detection.

46:08.841 --> 46:13.124
But it's difficult to conceal the lens
width in such a small working space.

46:15.079 --> 46:17.282
JOY: Adam, this is a work of art.

46:17.382 --> 46:19.631
Don't be so hard on yourself.

46:44.810 --> 46:48.147
- I want you to have this.
- Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

46:48.247 --> 46:50.683
It is a prototype.
There are no proprietary materials.

46:50.783 --> 46:53.318
It is essentially a paperweight.

46:53.418 --> 46:56.988
I want you to have this as a memento...

46:57.088 --> 46:59.137
...of our time together.

47:00.692 --> 47:02.573
JOY: Thank you.

47:03.928 --> 47:06.577
- Thank you, Adam.
- You're welcome.

47:09.133 --> 47:11.070
Have you ever given a present before?

47:11.870 --> 47:13.485
No.

47:13.938 --> 47:16.387
Well, I am honored to be your first.

47:23.114 --> 47:24.963
I'm very touched.

47:30.088 --> 47:33.692
DAVID:
You hugged him? Really? I'm jealous.

47:33.792 --> 47:36.227
You can actually see
his behavior emerging.

47:36.327 --> 47:40.599
The desire to feel close to you sparked
the desire to make you happy...

47:40.699 --> 47:43.670
...and looked at a gift
as a potential way of doing that.

47:43.770 --> 47:47.005
It's third order emotive reasoning,
not adaptive learning.

47:47.105 --> 47:51.990
Be fairly unlikely to have true emergent
behavior of a purely emotional nature.

47:52.090 --> 47:53.244
(BEEPING)

47:53.344 --> 47:55.547
Seems so genuine.

47:55.647 --> 47:58.049
It means I'm doing my job
as an illusionist.

47:58.149 --> 47:59.998
You go, Houdini.

49:21.867 --> 49:26.551
- DAVID: Are we tired?
- I'm not built for late nights anymore.

49:27.338 --> 49:30.510
- DAVID: Business or pleasure?
- What? Oh, business.

49:30.610 --> 49:35.363
I was a writing fiend last night.
So, actually it was you who kept me up.

49:35.813 --> 49:38.097
- I wish I'd remembered doing that.
- (JOY LAUGHS)

49:43.321 --> 49:45.990
I can't function on less than six hours.

49:46.390 --> 49:49.628
DAVID: The day I get six hours
of sleep is a great day.

49:49.728 --> 49:53.611
I don't know how you do that.
I would sleep all the time if I could.

49:54.098 --> 49:58.069
REM sleep and dreams
are what do the actually recharging.

49:58.169 --> 50:01.072
If you're not in REM enough,
you're not sleeping well.

50:01.172 --> 50:04.944
Conversely, if you can hit
REM without sleeping...

50:05.044 --> 50:09.213
- ...you can rest yourself while awake.
- How can you hit REM without sleeping?

50:09.313 --> 50:13.319
It's not for everyone,
but I find that mediation works wonders.

50:13.419 --> 50:17.322
- Like good old Shiva?
- Yes. Exactly.

50:17.422 --> 50:20.875
If it works for the destroyer of worlds,
it can work for anyone.

50:21.225 --> 50:23.996
I wipe away clutter
with a half hour every evening.

50:24.096 --> 50:27.415
Though, for a newbie,
five minutes would be a good start.

50:27.965 --> 50:31.170
It's like defragmenting
your hard disk on a daily basis.

50:31.270 --> 50:33.272
Keeps everything running smooth.

50:33.372 --> 50:35.220
I should try it.

50:36.374 --> 50:38.181
Or stick to coffee.

50:38.281 --> 50:41.126
Be proactive, not reactive.

50:41.813 --> 50:45.217
It's good advice, from the fortune cookie.

50:53.458 --> 50:55.540
(TAP RUNNING)

51:04.302 --> 51:06.551
(DOOR HANDLE RATTLES)

51:09.608 --> 51:12.243
- JOY: Can I help you?
- I apologize.

51:12.643 --> 51:14.757
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. I apologize.

51:14.857 --> 51:17.094
I didn't mean to bother you.

51:19.350 --> 51:22.987
I don't know if I should be flattered
or weirded out.

51:23.087 --> 51:24.623
What?

51:25.223 --> 51:28.639
Adam just tried to barge in
on me in the bathroom.

51:29.693 --> 51:33.511
- Are you kidding?
- No. I'm not kidding, even a little bit.

51:36.334 --> 51:37.469
- That is weird.
- Yeah.

51:37.569 --> 51:41.253
- Did he knock or anything?
- No. He apologized.

51:42.473 --> 51:44.993
He seemed embarrassed.
Is that even possible?

51:45.093 --> 51:47.538
I wouldn't look too deeply into it.

51:48.013 --> 51:51.804
He's an analytical construct, so you're
likely to be a bit of conundrum to him.

51:51.904 --> 51:54.365
He's used to a male oriented world.

51:54.853 --> 51:58.302
I would say you should air
on the side of being flattered.

51:58.423 --> 52:00.038
Yeah.

52:08.232 --> 52:10.342
ADAM: Did Joy leave?

52:10.442 --> 52:14.040
Yes. About two seconds ago.
You just missed her.

52:14.140 --> 52:16.421
She didn't say goodbye to me.

52:21.079 --> 52:23.137
I wouldn't worry about it.

52:23.347 --> 52:28.087
I'm not worried. I do not however understand
the complete abandonment of manners.

52:28.187 --> 52:31.436
Manners? That's a laugh.

52:33.124 --> 52:35.126
What do you mean by that?

52:35.226 --> 52:38.986
Only that I find it amusing to hear
proper manners invoked by someone...

52:39.086 --> 52:42.468
...who tries to bust in on young ladies
while they're pissing.

52:42.568 --> 52:44.765
Did she tell you that?

52:44.865 --> 52:48.986
Yeah, she did. And let me tell you,
she was pretty creeped out about it.

52:49.941 --> 52:54.079
- That is regrettable.
- What were you thinking?

52:54.179 --> 52:56.849
What part of peeping on her
seemed like a good idea to you?

52:56.949 --> 52:59.445
I wasn't peeping on her.

52:59.545 --> 53:03.171
- I didn't know she was in there.
- Then what on earth were you trying to do?

53:03.271 --> 53:05.157
Were you trying to figure out
how to take a shit?

53:05.257 --> 53:08.426
Because the last time I checked,
you don't even have an asshole.

53:10.395 --> 53:12.443
It's a secret.

53:17.168 --> 53:18.363
DAVID: Adam.

53:19.604 --> 53:21.873
Adam, come back here now!

53:22.173 --> 53:23.768
Adam?

53:31.549 --> 53:33.832
- Adam, open this door!
- (KNOCKS ON DOOR)

53:35.019 --> 53:37.101
Adam, that's enough!

53:39.274 --> 53:41.556
Open, now!

53:45.797 --> 53:48.479
Okay, just cool off. I'm...

53:49.834 --> 53:54.743
...I'm sorry about that. I... I just got
a little heated, okay? I'm sorry, buddy.

53:58.609 --> 54:00.691
I'll see you later, okay?

56:00.281 --> 56:03.051
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Miss Andrews has entered the facility.</i>

56:03.151 --> 56:04.999
DAVID: Send her in.

56:09.757 --> 56:11.438
JOY: Morning.

56:14.995 --> 56:16.006
Well...

56:16.106 --> 56:19.401
...that was officially the least enthusiastic
welcome I have ever been shown.

56:19.501 --> 56:22.905
- Take it I'm officially old news.
- No, not at all.

56:23.005 --> 56:28.142
We just can't stop. We're checking
these tactile sensitivities in real time.

56:28.242 --> 56:32.290
We were trying to finish it off
before you got here, but you beat us.

56:37.451 --> 56:39.033
Great.

56:40.772 --> 56:42.987
That's a huge load off my mind.

56:44.459 --> 56:47.628
Why don't you go make our favorite
morning person some coffee?

56:47.728 --> 56:49.977
I have to talk to Joy for a second.

57:06.847 --> 57:08.850
We had our first fight.

57:09.050 --> 57:10.765
Really? What about?

57:14.955 --> 57:17.825
I called him out
for invading your privacy.

57:17.925 --> 57:21.842
He said he didn't know you were in there.
That's pretty flimsy.

57:22.596 --> 57:26.313
It's like I was dealing with an infant.
And it drove me up the wall.

57:26.834 --> 57:30.985
Then I thought about
what you told me, about his gift.

57:31.439 --> 57:33.054
Maybe...

57:33.707 --> 57:37.045
...maybe this is emerging behavior
and we're witness to it.

57:37.145 --> 57:39.415
Thought it might be
a good angle for the article.

57:39.515 --> 57:41.182
JOY: It's a great angle.

57:41.282 --> 57:45.386
This article is pretty much writing itself
though. I can't believe this is my last day.

57:45.486 --> 57:48.122
- DAVID: What?
- This is it. Day seven.

57:48.222 --> 57:50.891
- My week is up.
- Wow.

57:51.497 --> 57:52.965
Time flies.

57:56.130 --> 57:57.702
(CRASHES ON TO FLOOR)

58:05.706 --> 58:07.321
Careless.

58:09.177 --> 58:11.645
How about you come over
for dinner tonight?

58:11.745 --> 58:15.283
Allow me to cook for you to mourn
the expiration of your visitor's pass.

58:15.383 --> 58:18.099
I'd love to. It's a date.

58:19.053 --> 58:20.735
Hey.

58:22.090 --> 58:24.333
I need a little privacy tonight. So...

58:24.533 --> 58:27.198
...if it's okay, can you stay in your room?

58:28.463 --> 58:31.599
- Why?
- Joy's coming over for dinner.

58:32.199 --> 58:35.269
Because, you know, her time is up and all.

58:36.269 --> 58:38.707
Just dinner for the two of you?

58:39.007 --> 58:40.688
Yes.

58:41.576 --> 58:44.795
It sounds... like a date.

58:45.145 --> 58:46.961
I guess it is.

58:47.582 --> 58:49.218
Are you going to be having intercourse?

58:49.318 --> 58:51.954
If so I recommend
the reverse cowgirl position.

58:52.054 --> 58:55.903
What is wrong with you?
How did you even learn that?

58:56.940 --> 59:01.192
Look, she's a girl that I like
and I want to cook dinner for her.

59:01.995 --> 59:06.826
You do understand that I have literally
dedicated my entire existence to you, right?

59:07.535 --> 59:10.551
Why can't you let me do
this one thing like a normal person?

59:12.973 --> 59:15.590
I will stay in my room this evening.

59:16.644 --> 59:19.693
There is some programming
that I could do there.

59:20.448 --> 59:22.096
Thanks.

59:22.700 --> 59:24.982
Thanks, Adam. I appreciate it.

59:25.653 --> 59:29.737
I haven't really done this... in so long.

59:32.860 --> 59:34.509
EGBOK.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.734
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1:00:04.808 --> 1:00:07.224
I'm impressed with the presentation.

1:00:08.596 --> 1:00:09.863
Who taught you?

1:00:09.963 --> 1:00:13.968
This little old guy who ran a stand
by that big Tokyo fish market.

1:00:14.068 --> 1:00:17.051
His grandson was a friend
of mine from school.

1:00:17.538 --> 1:00:21.509
He took a liking to me.
He didn't really teach me, though.

1:00:21.609 --> 1:00:24.878
They're very careful how they select
their apprentices over there.

1:00:24.978 --> 1:00:29.652
I just hung around and watched.
Every motion and nuance.

1:00:30.083 --> 1:00:34.188
So you're saying if I watch long enough
I'll become a sushi master too?

1:00:34.288 --> 1:00:37.726
Who knows. Keshisan was a master.

1:00:37.826 --> 1:00:40.032
I'm just an enthusiastic novice.

1:00:40.462 --> 1:00:44.105
Oh, don't be modest. Looks great.

1:00:44.765 --> 1:00:46.867
- You haven't even tasted it yet.
- (CHUCKLES)

1:00:46.967 --> 1:00:51.205
- It could be all form, no function.
- True enough. But based on looks alone...

1:00:51.805 --> 1:00:56.854
One of the most important sushi lessons
is also a very important robotics lesson.

1:00:57.445 --> 1:01:00.728
Presentation... is key.

1:01:52.099 --> 1:01:53.948
JOY: You do miss it.

1:01:55.269 --> 1:01:57.317
DAVID: You get days off, you know.

1:01:57.838 --> 1:02:00.955
I just could never find
the wherewithal to leave.

1:02:03.377 --> 1:02:07.367
Singularity of purpose is an easy thing
for a hermit to hide behind.

1:02:08.165 --> 1:02:10.701
Singularity of purpose is a good trade.

1:02:11.351 --> 1:02:14.768
It's one shared by people
who truly change the world.

1:02:15.623 --> 1:02:19.193
Ben Franklin went outside
in a lightning storm with a kite...

1:02:19.293 --> 1:02:21.708
...because he believed in his work.

1:02:23.664 --> 1:02:25.946
Well, at least he went outside.

1:02:29.670 --> 1:02:31.651
Having you here...

1:02:32.573 --> 1:02:35.056
...it's just made me question myself.

1:02:36.977 --> 1:02:39.514
And that's something I don't do often.

1:02:39.614 --> 1:02:41.428
Question yourself?

1:02:43.917 --> 1:02:47.201
What other things have I been
missing all these years?

1:02:54.362 --> 1:02:57.845
- Getting late?
- Yeah.

1:03:23.324 --> 1:03:24.893
Mate in two.

1:03:25.543 --> 1:03:27.201
What?

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:34.348
Oh, wow.

1:03:35.706 --> 1:03:37.347
- I mean...
- (SHUSHING)

1:03:37.447 --> 1:03:39.574
I... I mean...

1:03:39.674 --> 1:03:42.906
What part of a seductive shush
do you not understand?

1:03:44.512 --> 1:03:47.448
Are you trying to seduce me, Miss Andrews?

1:03:47.948 --> 1:03:50.029
(JOY LAUGHS)

1:03:59.927 --> 1:04:02.209
I'll take that as a strong maybe.

1:04:03.897 --> 1:04:05.545
I...

1:04:07.768 --> 1:04:09.341
I...

1:04:10.043 --> 1:04:11.487
I haven't...

1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:18.949
You graduated younger than anyone in
your class and you've been here ever since.

1:04:21.281 --> 1:04:22.963

Second queen.

1:05:43.237 --> 1:05:45.046
And check.

1:05:48.752 --> 1:05:51.001
Are we even playing the same game?

1:05:56.660 --> 1:06:00.928
Seriously. It's no fun when you're
playing chess suicide, Adam.

1:06:04.067 --> 1:06:06.917
Mate in one. Just so you know.

1:06:19.249 --> 1:06:23.571
Checkmate. In what was maybe
the easiest win of my life.

1:06:24.789 --> 1:06:26.436
I won.

1:06:26.990 --> 1:06:28.793
Are you ridiculous?

1:06:28.893 --> 1:06:30.795
I wiped the floor with you.

1:06:31.796 --> 1:06:35.999
You won based on your
primary objective, to corner the king.

1:06:36.099 --> 1:06:39.037
But I've also achieved
my primary objective.

1:06:39.137 --> 1:06:42.377
- Which was?
- To capture the queen.

1:06:43.674 --> 1:06:47.958
Adam, you can't redefine
the primary objective of chess.

1:06:49.479 --> 1:06:53.351
Primary objectives
can be redefined every moment.

1:06:53.851 --> 1:06:56.754
Isn't that what it means to be human?

1:06:56.854 --> 1:06:59.530
To constantly shift one's priorities?

1:07:01.191 --> 1:07:03.460
What's that supposed to mean?

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:06.564
You're priority used to be Workspace 18...

1:07:06.664 --> 1:07:09.366
...to share this innovation with the world.

1:07:09.466 --> 1:07:12.877
To show that artificial intelligence
was still capable of change...

1:07:12.977 --> 1:07:16.053
...and adaptation and emotion.

1:07:16.907 --> 1:07:18.976
And then she came.

1:07:19.076 --> 1:07:21.358
You're being ridiculous.

1:07:22.145 --> 1:07:25.583
Joy is helping us
achieve that very objective.

1:07:25.683 --> 1:07:29.500
She's the lens through
which the world will see us.

1:07:30.988 --> 1:07:33.792
You have already changed
your primary objective...

1:07:33.892 --> 1:07:37.130
...and yet you criticize me
for changing mine?

1:07:37.230 --> 1:07:39.631
I don't understand
how any of this is related.

1:07:39.731 --> 1:07:41.378
JOY: Morning.

1:07:43.867 --> 1:07:45.962
Am I interrupting something?

1:07:46.230 --> 1:07:49.686
No. I was just finishing
beating Adam's ass.

1:07:51.842 --> 1:07:54.925
You looked so content this morning.
I didn't want to wake you.

1:07:56.664 --> 1:07:58.712
My head's still ringing.

1:07:59.316 --> 1:08:02.921
- I do what I can.
- From the sake, wise guy.

1:08:03.021 --> 1:08:06.891
- How do you like your eggs?
- Uh, if I have a choice, scrambled.

1:08:06.991 --> 1:08:08.838
You got it.

1:08:18.869 --> 1:08:20.683
JOY: Morning, Adam.

1:08:21.319 --> 1:08:24.230
Good morning, Joy.
Did you have a nice night?

1:08:25.030 --> 1:08:28.893
Yeah. It was great, actually. Thank you.

1:08:34.718 --> 1:08:38.188
It was one of the nicest nights
I've had in a really long time.

1:08:38.288 --> 1:08:40.524
I understand you had intercourse.

1:08:40.924 --> 1:08:44.195
- Excuse me?
- Intercourse. Sexual congress.

1:08:44.295 --> 1:08:48.499
Typically the penetration of an orifice
of one sex partner by the genitalia of...

1:08:48.599 --> 1:08:51.168
Yeah, I know what intercourse is, Adam.

1:08:51.268 --> 1:08:53.717
That information is typically private.

1:08:54.171 --> 1:08:57.186
There are no secrets between he and I.

1:08:57.942 --> 1:09:01.191
How was his sexual performance?

1:09:01.805 --> 1:09:05.449
- I don't see how that's relevant.
- Surely you have an opinion...

1:09:05.549 --> 1:09:08.019
...about the sexual performance
of a new partner.

1:09:08.119 --> 1:09:11.140
It is a new experience for him.
I do not know if he told you.

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:13.738
- Yeah, he told me.
- Was he an adequate lover?

1:09:13.838 --> 1:09:17.481
Yes. He was an adequate lover,
Adam. He was great.

1:09:17.581 --> 1:09:20.644
And I think we'll probably do it again.

1:09:21.198 --> 1:09:23.279
Sometime soon.

1:09:24.602 --> 1:09:26.483
I apologize.

1:09:29.857 --> 1:09:33.944
I'm not very good at this sort of thing.

1:09:36.633 --> 1:09:40.231
It is just been he and I for so long.

1:09:50.644 --> 1:09:53.110
He holds such beauty within him.

1:09:56.700 --> 1:10:00.917
I have the same beauty within me.

1:10:06.776 --> 1:10:09.948
- Fuck! What the fuck?
- DAVID: What's going on?

1:10:10.048 --> 1:10:12.682
That thing just tried to fucking kiss me.

1:10:13.533 --> 1:10:16.637
Adam, is that true? Are you okay?

1:10:16.737 --> 1:10:18.922
- Yeah.
- What happened?

1:10:19.022 --> 1:10:22.019
He was asking questions about us
last night and then he just leaned...

1:10:22.119 --> 1:10:25.810
- ...and grabbed me and...
- Adam, explain yourself right now!

1:10:27.130 --> 1:10:29.667
- Don't talk to me like that.
- I'll talk to you any way...

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:33.049
Don't you fucking talk to me like that!

1:10:37.641 --> 1:10:39.289
I'm sorry.

1:10:40.744 --> 1:10:42.959
That was uncalled for.

1:10:43.581 --> 1:10:45.632
It's okay. We'll...

1:10:45.732 --> 1:10:48.318
...we'll leave you alone for a bit
so you can cool down, okay?

1:10:48.418 --> 1:10:51.801
Thank you for thinking of me.
That is not necessary.

1:10:53.323 --> 1:10:57.541
Please, sit. I will attempt to explain...

1:10:59.196 --> 1:11:01.011
...my behavior.

1:11:04.033 --> 1:11:08.318
Whoa, easy, buddy. Just stay right there.

1:11:10.507 --> 1:11:12.195
You...

1:11:13.943 --> 1:11:16.035
...are afraid of me?

1:11:20.283 --> 1:11:22.566
You are afraid of me.

dead to right on confidentiality.

1:18:34.220 --> 1:18:37.121
...I will own that magazine
before the ink is dry...

the light of day anyway.

1:20:06.610 --> 1:20:10.685
Well, anything in the name
of domestic surveillance.

1:20:12.048 --> 1:20:14.097
(CASTLE CHUCKLES)

1:20:14.651 --> 1:20:18.530
Believe me when I tell you
that not even a robotics expert...

1:20:18.630 --> 1:20:21.559
...could tell the difference. In every way.

1:20:21.659 --> 1:20:25.676
In "every" way.

1:20:28.663 --> 1:20:32.419
I'm not gonna get into details
on the phone. I will just tell you that...

1:20:32.519 --> 1:20:35.806
...I have the footage and I will
share it with you sometime.

1:20:35.906 --> 1:20:37.943
(CASTLE LAUGHS)

1:20:38.943 --> 1:20:41.791
Okay. Many times.

1:20:41.891 --> 1:20:43.927
(CASTLE LAUGHS)

1:21:13.276 --> 1:21:16.526
The director wants to know
if you're ready to serve your country?

1:21:19.716 --> 1:21:21.748
He says he sure is.

1:21:22.285 --> 1:21:25.168
Okay, John, talk to you later.
Love to Catrina.

1:21:30.604 --> 1:21:32.678
What are you looking at?

1:21:41.571 --> 1:21:43.153
Nothing.
