WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:09.714
Happy birthday.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.297
Thank you. Thank you.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.306
I'll never get this confetti
out of my hair, but thank you.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.754
The hats were my idea.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.428
Seventeen has gotta be better
than 16.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.927
I mean, I've got a great boyfriend,
I'm not new at school,

00:20.103 --> 00:22.512
and I've finally gotten used to
being a witch.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.274
- I'll have the liver-and-brie omelette.
- Here's your present.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.651
I love presents.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.602
It's a handbook.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.154
One of these days,
we have to talk about cool presents.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.117
This is a study guide.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.991
You see, when a witch turns 17,
she has to take a test

00:38.163 --> 00:39.789
to get her witch's licence.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.997
Will I have to parallel park
my vacuum cleaner?

00:42.167 --> 00:43.366
It doesn't work like that.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.037
But for some reason you do
have to take an eye exam.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.121
A quizmaster will come
in the next few days and test you.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.376
- You only have two chances--
- Don't worry. I can handle it.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.340
I've gotta run
or I'm gonna miss my bus.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.299
Unless my other present is a car.

00:59.518 --> 01:03.813
- Don't forget this.
- Next year, clothes, right?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.403
She's never gonna study.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.564
We have got to tell her
about the consequences.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.314
You know the rules.
We've given her the book.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.904
Now it's up to Sabrina.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.154
I'm sorry.
I thought I asked for an omelette.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.362
Hello.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.681 --> 01:39.971
Don't be shellfish.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.610
- Can I help you?
- I can't find my locker.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.986
I'm Valerie. This is my first day.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.280
I'm Sabrina. I was new last year.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.194
Don't worry.
It's a pretty friendly school.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.161
Freak.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.910
- So, what's your locker number?
- Um...

02:03.081 --> 02:05.075
- Twenty-seven.
- That's right near mine. Come on.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.956
- So where did you move from?
- Minnesota. We move a lot.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.703
- Why'd that girl call you a freak?
- Libby?

02:10.881 --> 02:13.373
Because she's a cheerleader,
and she has a limited vocabulary.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.627
Oh, so you're not really odd?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.962
No. Well, not in a way
that anyone knows about.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.844
Good, because just once
I'd like to be in a cool crowd.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.844
Oh, I know that makes me sound
really shallow.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.177
I hate that about myself.
Look, just go on without me.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.762
- I'm dragging you down.
- Here's your locker.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.269
You're still talking to me.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.435
Oh, Sabrina.
Just who I'm looking for.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.817
I think you should take AP Algebra
after school.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.740
It's a lot of work,
but you can get college credit for it.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.402
- I think I can handle that.
- Great.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.320
That's an interesting book.
May I see that?

02:40.494 --> 02:45.620
Oh, it's kind of a family heirloom.
And that's why I keep it in my locker.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.578
Oh.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.160
- Hey, birthday girl.
- It's your birthday?

02:50.712 --> 02:52.291
Or is that a nickname?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.041
Harvey, this is Valerie.
Valerie, Harvey.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.597
I love my earrings. Thanks.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.639
My mom said you'd like them
more than a knife.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.386
Oh, here, taste these.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.637
I baked them for the football
bake sale tomorrow.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.932
Tastes like...

03:09.648 --> 03:11.642
Tell you what.
I'll bake you cookies for the sale.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.727
Thanks.
I was hoping you'd say that.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.441
Better get to chemistry.
See you later.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.446
Wow, teachers like you,
you've got a cute boyfriend...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.907
- Can I be your friend?
- We'll see.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.787
I'm having interviews all week.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.952
You're kidding, right? Because
that's happened to me before.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.407
You'll be the editor this year?

03:30.586 --> 03:33.541
Well, not in so many words.
Well, actually, it was just

03:33.714 --> 03:36.170
that many words. He said,
"You'll be the editor this year."

03:36.341 --> 03:38.964
- Cool.
- And when I am the editor

03:39.136 --> 03:41.260
the school paper
is going to be different.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.385
No freakazoid news.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.844
I can't believe Libby's taking over
the paper too.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.847
- You should take over the paper.
- Me?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.979
Yeah. You'd be great and fair.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.604
And I'm not saying that
because I want you to like me.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.560
- Thanks.
- Do you like me?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.983
Hello.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.327
Oh, yes.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.286
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.827
Prayers are answered. Yeah.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.122
Fifties, 20s.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.289
- Oh, my.
- Oh, good.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.588
Looks like our bond matured.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.336
The one we got in 1660?

04:19.510 --> 04:22.796
I knew people would say "yes"
to sanitation.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.878
You wanna go to the Slicery?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.967
I can't. I'm going to join
the newspaper staff.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.637
I thought you were swamped
with work.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.053
I am, but I can handle it.
And this has the added bonus

04:31.230 --> 04:33.057
of driving Libby insane.
I'll call you later.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.771
Okay, but you haven't forgotten
the dance on Friday, have you?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.853
The big event
honouring all the football players

04:38.028 --> 04:39.986
that everyone's been talking about
for weeks?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.615
I remember it.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.451
But I forgot your name.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.909
Looking for the loser convention?

04:50.082 --> 04:51.743
I am. And look:

04:51.917 --> 04:54.076
I found it.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.757
Hi. Hi, I'm Valerie.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.216
Ew, they're multiplying.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.759
I feel good about myself.
I feel good about myself.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.054
- I feel good about myself.
- Don't panic.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.724
When Mr. Kraft gets here
we'll clean house.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.395
Greetings, newshounds.
Welcome to the <i>Westbridge Lantern.</i>

05:14.565 --> 05:16.143
I think there's been a mistake.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.188
Mr. Kraft is the faculty advisor
of this club.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.525
Not anymore.

05:20.696 --> 05:25.026
After 17 years, he's grown to loathe
and detest the paper.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.364
Hi, Sabrina.

05:26.994 --> 05:32.120
Now, this year, the editorial position
is not going to be a popularity contest.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.783
- What?
- Everyone who is interested

05:34.960 --> 05:37.499
can submit an editorial by tomorrow.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.548
This is amazing.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.419
And I didn't even use magic.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.336
Magic?

05:43.635 --> 05:48.844
Yeah. That's Westbridge slang
for curse words.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.633
I hate being new.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.266
Great cake.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.181
Piece number five
might've been a mistake.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.350
Do I have any frosting on my face?

05:58.442 --> 06:00.352
Well, a birthday should be
a time for fun.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.605
Did you get a chance
to study the handbook?

06:02.779 --> 06:06.529
Not really. Oh, man. Study.
I've got a history test tomorrow.

06:07.034 --> 06:11.329
Sabrina, remember:
The handbook is also important.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.866
Did our parents go through
this torture?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.959
Not with me.
I memorized the whole book.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.504
<i>I memorized the whole book.</i>

06:18.670 --> 06:20.545
- Get rid of them.
- What?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.086
The goody two-shoes.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.749
Oops.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.881
Sabrina, yo!

06:29.056 --> 06:30.432
I was just resting my eyes.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.305
Don't you think
you're overextending yourself?

06:33.477 --> 06:34.972
No.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.435
Okay. My editorial's done.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.849
Time for history.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.899
I'm so handling things.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.063
"Patrick Henry gave an impassioned
speech in Williamsburg,

06:46.240 --> 06:49.360
where he proclaimed,
'Give me liberty or give me death.""

06:49.535 --> 06:50.650
Actually, he was gonna say,

06:50.827 --> 06:53.201
"Give me liberty
or give me some other option."

06:53.372 --> 06:55.994
I told him I thought
it needed more punch.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.002
Hello? Hi, Harvey.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.880
Oh, hi, Harvey. I'm sorry.
I know I was supposed to call you.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.259
Now, tell me
if you don't think this is deep:

07:09.429 --> 07:13.179
When you assume something,
you make a...

07:13.350 --> 07:15.676
Shoot. I knew I should have
written it down.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.563
<i>If you...</i>

07:18.730 --> 07:21.685
Shoot. Maybe it wasn't "assume."

07:22.526 --> 07:25.481
Sabrina? Sabrina?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.238
<i>Sabrina?</i>

07:31.243 --> 07:32.738
--degrees here
at downtown Westbridge.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.198
Let us greet the day
with The Brothers Chunk.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.785
Ow!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.664
- Who are you?
- I'm your quizmaster.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.248
Please, don't hit.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.747
- Is it time for the test?
- Are you kidding?

07:44.923 --> 07:48.009
You are not ready.
This is a warning.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.344
You haven't cracked this hand.
I mean, not even the knuckles.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.515
Hey. I like that one.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.300
Okay, you've made your point.
I'll study.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.182
- And stop hitting.
- When will I have the actual test?

07:59.354 --> 08:02.475
When you least expect it.

08:05.611 --> 08:09.063
Ohh, I hope I can handle this.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.278
Man, I did lousy on that history test.

08:13.452 --> 08:16.240
I know. I got so frustrated in there,
I almost used magic.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.743
What?

08:17.915 --> 08:20.620
- Curse words, right?
- Oh, right.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.082
Look, Val, I gotta run.
I gotta meet Harvey for lunch.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.879
- Okay. Bye.
- See you.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.916
Oh, no. What are you doing here,
quizmaster?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.587
Well, have you been studying,
Sabrina?

08:29.760 --> 08:32.761
- The test is coming, you know.
- I know. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.136
Oh, I can fix that.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.924
Can you stop time, Sabrina?
Page 201.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.217
Okay, I'll look it up.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.147
Well, how about speeding time up?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.355
Page 949.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.933
Okay. I've been warned.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.529
Oh, great. Now you sped up time,
and now I'm late.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.821
- Hi, Harvey. Eating alone?
- No, he's not.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.076
Sorry.
Time kind of got away from me.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.327
I wanted to talk to you
about tux colours.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.333
Can I finish your sandwich?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.332
I can't decide between powder blue
and maroon.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.715
Let me have everyone's attention,
please.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.546
Great. Mr. School-Spirit.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.047
Some of you freshmen
have not met me yet.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.549
I am Vice Principal Kraft.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.221
Just like the cheese.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.138
Loser.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.515
And I heard that.

09:24.690 --> 09:28.024
Now, I am happy to announce
that the pep club has decided

09:28.193 --> 09:34.233
to decorate the dance this Friday with
posters honouring each football player.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.661
- Wow, Harvey, your own poster.
- And that's not all.

09:38.829 --> 09:42.281
These posters will be made
by each player's girlfriend.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.700
So, gals, get busy.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.076
That's ridiculous.

09:46.962 --> 09:51.043
Ooh, let's just hope you have
Tourette's, little missy.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.044
Just because a girl's dating
a football player

09:53.218 --> 09:55.545
doesn't mean she has time
to do artwork for him on demand.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.928
Yeah, well, you see,
we're just talking about

09:58.098 --> 10:01.100
sprucing up the dance,
not taking back the vote.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.019
I think posters are a brilliant idea.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.016
Well, thank you, Libby.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.183
And thank your father
for that box of steaks.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.195
You understand what I mean,
don't you?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.560
I'd feel like your slave.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.277
No, I understand. It's a stupid idea.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.241
- Who needs a poster?
- Right.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.154
So now, what were you saying
about tuxedos?

10:19.328 --> 10:20.574
Oh, I need help deciding--

10:21.955 --> 10:23.664
Sorry. We'll talk later.

10:23.832 --> 10:28.828
Oh, well. Maybe one day you'll have
a girlfriend who cares about you.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.960
Oh, no.

10:33.133 --> 10:37.002
Sabrina forgot this again.
I know we're not allowed to tell her

10:37.179 --> 10:42.174
what will happen if she fails,
but how about I just zap it to her?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.064
- Hey.
- It's Sabrina's responsibility.

10:48.232 --> 10:49.893
We're not allowed to meddle.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.308
All right.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.227
You know, it's weird.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.277
I keep counting this,
and I keep coming up short.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.482
Really?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.749
<i>Oh, please, please. Oh, please.</i>

11:15.592 --> 11:17.586
- Hey.
- Hi. I don't have time to talk.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.253
I've gotta get to my AP Algebra
after-school-lecture, credit,

11:20.430 --> 11:21.712
college-prep thing.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.347
Well, okay,
but can I have the cookies?

11:24.518 --> 11:25.550
What cookies?

11:25.727 --> 11:27.638
The cookies you said you'd bake
for the sale.

11:27.813 --> 11:30.387
- It's starting in five minutes.
- Right. Wait here.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.399
Whoa.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.232
If you wish to run, Miss Spellman,

11:37.406 --> 11:40.527
the girl's track-and-field team
meets after school.

11:40.701 --> 11:44.237
In the hallway, we walk.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.991
Yes, sir.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.882
And, Miss Spellman, I would--

11:56.049 --> 11:57.461
Well, where did those come from?

11:58.302 --> 11:59.334
Bakery?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.386
No, I just bumped into you
five seconds ago.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.679
You did not have any cookies.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.225
Yes, I did.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.688
If I weren't on antihistamines,
I'd look into this.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.527
- Oh, no. Now?
- Are you ready?

12:20.866 --> 12:22.242
Put those back. I conjured those.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.608
Oh, just reverse my spell.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.825
- I don't know how.
- It's on page 77.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.074
You know,
you really should try studying.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.828
Toodles.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.959
I have to go.
Where are the cookies?

12:33.587 --> 12:37.420
Robbery? I'm sorry, I forgot.
I was really busy.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.834
You know, Sabrina,
you're always busy these days.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.004
It's like you don't have time
to be my girlfriend.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.015
That's not true. I've just had other
really important stuff to do.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.559
- So I'm not important.
- I didn't say that.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.809
Let's just forget about the dance.
I'm sure you're too busy anyway.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.733
Hilda, I've been thinking about what
we should do with the bond money.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.532
I think we should invest it.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.367
Oh, no. You promised
this would be fun money.

13:07.538 --> 13:10.112
Really? Doesn't sound like me.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.118
I don't wanna be practical.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.998
Come on, Zeldy.
Imagine your wildest dream.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.999
Okay.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.715
Another T-bill, please.

13:24.888 --> 13:29.931
No, no, no. Here, I'll show you
how to daydream.

13:31.353 --> 13:35.186
- Is that Erik Estrada?
- Yeah. I loved him in <i>CHiPs.</i>

13:35.357 --> 13:38.727
Oh, but you have to see him
in <i>Dos Mujeres, Un Camino.</i>

13:38.902 --> 13:41.062
But you can't buy Erik Estrada.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.524
No. But maybe you can lure him

13:43.699 --> 13:48.777
with this '62 Thunderbird convertible.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.039
- Now try again.
- All right.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.628
Much better.

13:59.923 --> 14:00.956
Ugh.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.004
Sorry. I really like investing.

14:06.013 --> 14:09.430
We are not blowing centuries
of interest on more interest.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.759
At least let me lick your hands.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.307
Sabrina?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.474
You were a little unfocused today.

14:17.733 --> 14:18.765
- Was I?
- Yeah.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.944
You see, six times seven is 42,
not 12.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.144
Sorry.

14:23.322 --> 14:25.481
Man, do I need a cupcake.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.449
Maybe it's because I went generic,
I don't know.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.786
Darn HMO.
Who's supposed to read this?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.618
Hi. Got a minute?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.036
Actually, I'm in the middle
of something important.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.708
Here's your yummy doodles.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.798
Well, whenever you wanna talk,
I'm ready.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.298
Trouble with the little lady?

14:49.473 --> 14:53.306
How about we buy stocks?
That's exciting. It's just like gambling.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.352
No one talk to me.
I have to call Harvey.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.980
We're obviously never going to agree,
so how about we flip for it?

14:59.149 --> 15:00.395
Winner takes all.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.146
Deal.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.319
My head, I win.
Your head, you lose.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.984
Yeah, like I'm gonna fall
for that old trick.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.246
Again.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.242
What's going on?

15:19.419 --> 15:22.920
His father said Harvey's still not home.
Why won't he talk to me?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.550
Maybe because he's still not home.

15:24.716 --> 15:28.549
Besides, don't you have other
more important things to worry about?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.551
- You rang?
- Great. The stressmaster.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.097
You know, the other kids I quiz
give me stuff.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.764
How about molecular transference,
Sabrina?

15:39.773 --> 15:41.518
Can you do that?

15:41.692 --> 15:43.650
I'd bone up if I were you.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.148
Oh, and remember.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.690
Fudge is a nice way to say, "I care."

15:50.617 --> 15:52.160
You got a cute one.

15:52.494 --> 15:56.113
He's right. I'm not ready.
I don't know molecular transference.

15:56.290 --> 15:57.666
Sure, you do.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.289
You know how to zap yourself
from one place to another.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.210
Yeah. Go ahead.
Put yourself behind the counter.

16:07.050 --> 16:11.049
You're thinking about too much.
Clear your mind. Try again.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.305
Oh, dear.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.055
You've shorted your finger.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.064
- Too much stress.
- Rats.

16:25.402 --> 16:29.448
- Ha! Well, look at that. I won.
- Rats.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.778
Okay.

16:30.949 --> 16:34.236
A panel of teachers read
everyone's editorials, and--

16:34.411 --> 16:35.575
We all like Libby's.

16:35.746 --> 16:38.415
Well, all the teachers thought
Libby's was really good.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.659
- All right.
- But not quite as interesting

16:40.834 --> 16:41.866
as Sabrina's.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.829
Sabrina, you are the new editor
of the <i>Westbridge Lantern.</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:48.961
Thanks. I can handle this.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.250
I think.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.220
That's just wrong.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.093
You're the editor.
I'm the editor's friend.

16:55.265 --> 17:00.094
There is no way this can't be cool.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.891
Talk to you later.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.440
What's all that?

17:03.607 --> 17:04.806
Newspaper stuff.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.810
- I'm editor. I know it's more work, but--
- No. It's great.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.989
Lots of famous people were editors
of their school newspaper.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.272
Really? Like who?

17:14.409 --> 17:15.868
Charlemagne?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.449
- Sabrina--
- I know.

17:19.373 --> 17:22.493
- Let's never fight again.
- Okay. And I've been thinking

17:22.667 --> 17:24.460
I'd like to make you a poster
for the dance.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.287
Doesn't that sort of go against
everything you believe in?

17:27.923 --> 17:29.122
Yeah, but big deal.

17:29.675 --> 17:32.381
- Do you have the time?
- Sure.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.963
- Thanks.
- And I bet if the girls in science club

17:35.138 --> 17:38.094
got their boyfriends to make them
posters, you'd make one for me, right?

17:38.267 --> 17:39.596
You bet.

17:39.768 --> 17:40.800
They're not, are they?

17:42.521 --> 17:45.143
I didn't mean that about the dance.
I really want you to come.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.397
- I'd love to.
- Great.

17:48.861 --> 17:51.898
You haven't ordered that
powder-blue tux yet, have you?

17:52.948 --> 17:54.989
There. Poster's done.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.867
- What do you think?
- It's gorgeous.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.412
If you're into gushy.

17:58.871 --> 18:02.406
Okay.
Now time to study the handbook.

18:02.583 --> 18:06.451
I think I'll start with
molecular transference.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.916
Howdy.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.922
- Look, I'm studying.
- Oh, great.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.466
- It's time.
- But I'm not ready.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.929
Hmm. Nope. I don't care.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.848
Okay. Ahem.

18:24.021 --> 18:27.106
Sabrina Spellman,
are you ready to be tested?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.184
I told you, no.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.641
Too bad.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.442
Sabrina Spellman, here is your quiz:

18:33.614 --> 18:37.315
Train A left Sturbridge at 8:00.
Train B left Boston at 6:30.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.285
What time will they meet
in Westbridge?

18:39.453 --> 18:41.612
I can do this.
Okay, what speed are they going?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.660
I believe this is your test.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.032
I know how to find the speed.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.037
Molecular transference.

18:48.212 --> 18:51.214
Come through,
and there's a new ring in your future.

18:53.967 --> 18:58.465
Yes. Excuse me.
Seventy-five miles per hour.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.264
Thank you.

19:08.649 --> 19:10.192
Who are you?

19:10.359 --> 19:11.854
I'm a dream.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.021
You're dreaming that someone
came for the speed--

19:14.196 --> 19:18.064
Sixty-two miles per hour.
--got the speed, and left.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.070
I hate these night runs.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.699
Got it. The trains should meet
in Westbridge at 1:03 a.m.

19:25.874 --> 19:30.122
Right. Unfortunately, there's only
one track in Westbridge.

19:30.504 --> 19:33.257
And it's already 1:02.

19:34.466 --> 19:35.748
Uh-oh.

19:35.926 --> 19:38.299
I know. I'll just divert them. Um...

19:38.470 --> 19:40.760
<i>Trains are big
And they are leaded</i>

19:40.931 --> 19:44.134
<i>Move them away
From where they're headed</i>

19:46.061 --> 19:49.478
- I did it.
- Excellent. Except...

19:49.648 --> 19:52.401
- Except what?
- Except when things are diverted

19:52.568 --> 19:55.771
they have to go somewhere.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.664
Oops.

20:16.592 --> 20:19.795
You have to remember
that all magic has consequences.

20:19.970 --> 20:23.554
And you have to think about
the consequences before you act.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.514
So I got it wrong?

20:26.685 --> 20:30.518
Ooh, people are gonna write country
music about how wrong you got it.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.605
Let me guess.
You failed your first try?

20:40.073 --> 20:42.696
- I'll get it next time.
- I'm sure you will.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.027
But, unfortunately, there's a penalty.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.948
No dessert?

20:47.372 --> 20:49.947
Witch camp? What's witch camp?

20:50.125 --> 20:51.834
It's like military school.

20:52.002 --> 20:56.083
If military school were run
by really strict, sadistic witches.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.507
It'll be okay.
We'll pick you up in two days.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.421
Two days?
But I'll miss Harvey's dance.

21:01.595 --> 21:04.052
But you'll learn to kill
and cook your own food.
