00:09.720 --> 00:11.838
Hey, kid.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.318
-They're ready for you.
-Shit.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.400
You might want to go clean up first.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.840
Time's up, JD. Let's go!

01:31.600 --> 01:33.600
Right this way, JD. Have a seat.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.198
So, Betty, why don't you tell us
exactly what happened?

01:58.200 --> 01:59.680
Gladly.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.078
I went with JD to Butcher's Bridge
at approximately 9:08 p.m.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.518
It was there that he tried to kiss me.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.158
I pushed him away.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.038
Then he attacked me.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.398
Luckily, I escaped.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.598
Then he...

02:17.600 --> 02:19.598
Then he chased me through the woods,

02:19.600 --> 02:23.758
ending in my backyard,
where he attacked me again.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.918
Obviously, he didn't succeed.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.760
I'd say he stumbled away
somewhere between 9:47 and 9:49.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.760
So... you were with a boy.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.838
Alone.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.678
At night?

02:41.680 --> 02:45.158
This handsome young man
tried to kiss you?

02:45.160 --> 02:46.718
Yes, he tried to kiss me.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.278
-Why is that so hard to believe?
-Betty.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.998
Betty's been going through a lot lately.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.478
She got an A minus.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.798
Are you sure you didn't do something
to make JD think it was okay?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.278
She went somewhere alone with him.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.838
I don't know what else
he's supposed to think.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.838
-And dressed like that.
-That is not the point!

03:01.840 --> 03:03.958
The point is that he is a psychopath

03:03.960 --> 03:06.718
who tried to make out with me
and then kill me.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.638
Betty, sexual assault

03:08.640 --> 03:10.758
-is a very serious accusation.
-Yeah!

03:10.760 --> 03:13.598
And Betty,
we've all seen JD's girlfriend.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.198
-Oh, Veronica.
-She's the one who brought you in?

03:17.200 --> 03:19.598
Betty's always been
a bit jealous of her.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.358
You know, she reminds me
of a young Grace Kelly.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.758
Okay, can we please just focus
on the issue at hand here?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.998
I am reporting an assault.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.118
Betty, we're just talking
about attempted murder here.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.558
-No need to get dramatic.
-JD attacked me!

03:32.560 --> 03:34.358
That... that's the issue!

03:34.360 --> 03:36.998
Doesn't look like he attacked you.
You look fine.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.918
Betty, look what you did
to this poor young boy.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.158
I mean, you need some Neosporin on that.
I think I have some in my purse.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.798
-Mom! No!
-JD?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.560
You want to tell your side?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.918
Look at that, Betty.
He's too shaken up to talk.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.278
So, Betty, let me break this down.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.638
You went to Butcher's Bridge alone with
a boy who is your friend's boyfriend,

03:57.640 --> 04:02.158
and then this boy right here
made a pass at you.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.678
-Then he attacked you...
-Yes.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.238
-But he's the one all beat up?
-Yeah, because I kicked his ass!

04:08.240 --> 04:10.120
-Betty, language.
-Betty?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.918
Are you sure that's what happened?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.798
Yes.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.278
God.

04:17.279 --> 04:21.040
Then why would his girlfriend tell me
she was with him all night?

04:22.360 --> 04:24.278
-What?
-She just left the station.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.078
They were in a car accident.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.278
Our boys were at the scene.
He got real banged up.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.198
What?! No, no. This is insane!

04:30.200 --> 04:32.558
Well, that we can agree on.
Mr. and Mrs. Finn,

04:32.560 --> 04:35.598
I'm sure your daughter's a good kid,
and if Mr. Dean here will agree

04:35.600 --> 04:37.598
not to press charges,
we can all make our separate--

04:37.600 --> 04:39.478
I am the one who wants
to press charges here!

04:39.480 --> 04:42.598
Don't be ungrateful. Please thank JD.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.838
This isn't over, you sicko!
Bastard! The truth will come out!

04:46.840 --> 04:48.518
No, let go of me! I'm telling the truth.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.078
-She got an A minus.
-I'm telling you, he's lying!

04:51.080 --> 04:53.720
-Come on, come on, sweetie.
-We're gonna go.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.758
Let's go.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.638
So then, am I free to go?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.240
I'm so sorry, JD.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.878
It's... it's fine.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.558
I just hope that Betty
gets the help that she needs.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.718
I do, too.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.120
Bud.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.198
Oh, Jesus.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.798
JD? Hi. Did you hear?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.958
Betty Finn's parents
sent her off to military school

06:32.960 --> 06:34.798
under mysterious circumstances,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.800
which means I'll probably
be valedictorian now!

07:19.720 --> 07:22.118
Why did my dad give me
these thick thighs?

07:22.120 --> 07:25.118
I've tried everything. I've tried
thigh corsets, giving up solid food.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.758
I even slept in boxers
soaked in apple cider vinegar.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.358
I heard he was with Betty.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.918
Betty couldn't handle the pressure.

07:30.920 --> 07:35.078
-She got an A minus.
-A minuses will do that to you.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.678
If I was her, and that handicapped,
I would kill myself.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.158
That is so...

07:39.160 --> 07:40.798
Betty Finn wasn't in my Spanish class.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.958
I heard Betty snorted
a bunch of poppers, and then bam!

07:43.960 --> 07:47.078
Fell face-first into
her mom's prized rosebush.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.480
Dope.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.440
What the hell?

08:11.040 --> 08:14.718
Thus, Founder's Day celebrates
how General Westerburg

08:14.720 --> 08:17.998
promised some tribe peace
in exchange for Little Feather,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.478
the slurpiest of their squaws,

08:20.480 --> 08:22.878
but then slaughtered them all anyway.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.198
Except for Little Feather, so it's
actually kind of an epic love story.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.878
And then the general took Little Feather
on a European tour,

08:28.880 --> 08:31.558
parading her ass as a civilized savage.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.158
But tragedy struck,

08:34.159 --> 08:38.080
and she caught syphilis
and died before they got to France.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.318
So, I guess the moral of the story is

08:43.320 --> 08:46.798
if you're gonna let your man step out
on you and give you a deadly STD,

08:46.800 --> 08:50.358
at least wait until after Paris.
<i>Merci.</i>

08:50.360 --> 08:51.720
Unbelievable.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.960
Meet me at lunch? Great.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.038
Betty Finn?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.518
No.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.318
Word on the street is drugs.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.958
She was ganked up on that good-good
every which way till Sunday.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.438
Then I say good riddance.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.318
We don't need her brand of
negative energy here at Westerburg.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.638
You know, I suggest we take a moment

09:25.640 --> 09:30.598
and sit with the fact that we
haven't had a suicide in nine days.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.638
-This is why we do this
-Jesus Christ.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.238
...clearly the message of my musical,
<i>Teenage Suicide: Don't Do It,</i>

09:35.240 --> 09:36.718
is reaching the youths.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.878
Well, I don't know
if a silly little play...

09:38.880 --> 09:42.758
Pauline, this kind of thing
is exactly why Richard left you.

09:42.760 --> 09:48.518
Excuse me, but Helen Hippinowski's
whore ass is why Richard left me.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.598
Be an example, okay? Session's over.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.078
-Maurice.
-Hi, how are you?

09:52.080 --> 09:53.680
No skating inside, please.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.680
Veronica.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.080
I texted you.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.760
What, no smile today?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.598
Sorry, just a lot of homework.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.678
Okay, well, I think we're good.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.600
They didn't believe Betty, so...

10:16.600 --> 10:17.960
How just.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.560
Babe, what's wrong?

10:22.160 --> 10:23.998
Nothing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.398
I told you, I did it for you.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
I do everything for you.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.880
I know.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.400
See you later?

10:46.600 --> 10:48.278
It's going so well.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.238
Juilliard is sending a scout
to opening night.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.718
-No way.
-Yeah.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.278
I want to keep my options open,
though, you know?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.758
-Sure.
-Of course.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.358
Hey.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.720
We need to have a little tête-à-tête.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.718
All right, you psycho.
I'm cashing in my chips.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.158
You owe me a big, fat favor.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.718
Do I?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.320
I want Lizzy gone.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.118
She got the lead in the play, and worse,

11:13.120 --> 11:15.638
she tarnished my personal brand.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.318
Pass.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.478
What?

11:19.480 --> 11:21.838
You know what I've been
thinking lately, Heather?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.478
I've been thinking
I might be invincible.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.080
Like, I could get away with anything.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.918
And as I recall,

11:29.920 --> 11:32.718
I already got away
with killing you once.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.920
There's really no reason
I couldn't get away with it again.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.358
So yeah, your little game of playing
dollhouse with me and Veronica...

11:42.360 --> 11:43.800
that's over.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.960
Where's Betty, JD?

11:50.360 --> 11:55.240
I wonder what would happen if I told
the police that you also assaulted me.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.878
That would probably
change things, right?

11:58.880 --> 12:00.678
I mean, come on.

12:00.680 --> 12:05.518
At a certain point, even the patriarchy
has to put two and two together.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.958
Love that you're leaning in, Heather,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.718
but next time,

12:09.720 --> 12:11.240
use a Tic Tac.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.598
Just get rid of Lizzy.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.000
Sorry, Heather, no can do.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.600
Shit.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.880
Mr. Waters, still mentoring
the young women of Sherwood.

15:18.880 --> 15:23.118
Ten dollars a song, nine
if you don't talk to me about your wife.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.600
I hear you know a guy.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.558
I know plenty of guys.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.678
A guy who can help me get something?
Something untraceable?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.120
Why should I help you?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.400
Because I know your situation.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.358
Mr. Duke's lawyer keeps you
on a pretty tight leash, right?

15:41.360 --> 15:42.918
It's such a shame.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.678
All of that money,
and just out of reach.

15:45.680 --> 15:49.320
So, you must go to school
with my step-bitch, Heather.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.158
Know what I'm gonna do

15:53.160 --> 15:58.038
as soon as Heather's human
hospital smell of a father dies?

15:58.040 --> 16:02.600
A naked cartwheel directly
into Nordstrom's Rack.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.040
But until then...

16:07.080 --> 16:10.158
I don't know a guy.
I know a woman.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.038
They call her Dr. Destiny.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.838
Dr. Destiny.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.280
How dramatic.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.840
What's life without a little drama?

16:22.840 --> 16:24.440
Tell her Jade sent you.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.720
I'm here to see Dr. Destiny?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.160
Jade sent me.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.440
Have a seat.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.880
Deep breath.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.280
Let's see who we have next.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.800
Mom?

18:29.880 --> 18:31.518
Let me take a good look at you.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.360
-I need a...
-I know what my son needs.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.998
The question is...

18:38.000 --> 18:40.040
what does my son need it for?

18:41.640 --> 18:43.080
Does it matter?

18:44.240 --> 18:45.680
"Does it matter?"

18:47.240 --> 18:49.120
Why are you always pulling my dick?

18:50.320 --> 18:52.198
Of course, it matters.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.760
Everything matters.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.158
Let me guess.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.318
You think it's all meaningless,
don't you?

18:59.320 --> 19:01.320
Just random chaos?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.160
Have you ever read <i> Moby Dick?</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:16.200
I was supposed to, but...

19:17.040 --> 19:19.358
I used to think that <i> Moby Dick</i> was about

19:19.360 --> 19:23.078
how it's futile to rebel
against authority.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.120
The white whale will always win.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.000
But now that I'm in a better place...

19:34.360 --> 19:36.838
I know that that's not the point.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.398
Save the speeches for Malcolm X.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.040
I just want a gun.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.800
I know.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.240
I know.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.760
What teenager wants to hear words
of wisdom from their mother, right?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.160
But JD...

20:04.080 --> 20:05.600
JD...

20:08.120 --> 20:10.238
I am not telling you

20:10.240 --> 20:12.200
to stop searching for the whale.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.520
I'm telling you to go out there...

20:18.600 --> 20:20.120
and drain the ocean.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.480
You're thinking too small, JD.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.838
The takeaway here

20:54.840 --> 20:57.320
isn't to go smaller
because it doesn't matter.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.480
It's to go bigger.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.158
You do the same amount of time
for killing one asshole

21:05.160 --> 21:07.400
as you do a thousand assholes, right?

21:11.480 --> 21:12.920
So, whatever you do...

21:15.680 --> 21:17.080
make sure it matters.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.920
Here.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.880
It's on the house.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.640
I don't need it where I am now.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.960
Jealous much?

22:11.720 --> 22:13.718
Lizzy?

22:13.720 --> 22:15.198
I just wanted to let you know,

22:15.200 --> 22:18.198
you're about the only person
I respect in this school.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.038
Heather Chandler tried
to use you as a prop,

22:20.040 --> 22:21.998
and then you turned her
into a side table.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.998
Something tells me
you've had a lifetime of practice.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.838
True. Who are you again?

22:27.840 --> 22:30.998
Just a fan.
I saw your rehearsal.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.040
You've truly shined
a light on Westerburg.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.960
That's so sweet.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.440
Arms out.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.760
Come through.
Stand aside for me. Arms out.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.920
Gun! Gun!

23:05.320 --> 23:06.998
Get off of me! I'm serious!

23:07.000 --> 23:09.398
Everybody, back up! Back up!

23:09.400 --> 23:10.878
What the hell is going on?

23:10.880 --> 23:12.560
No, get off of me.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.118
-Loaded.
-No, that's not mine.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.678
No, I swear, I wasn't...

23:17.680 --> 23:20.158
"They will all pay
for how they treated me."

23:20.160 --> 23:21.958
That's not my gun.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.838
No, that is not mine.
Somebody gave that to me.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.198
No, I swear! Think that
I would bring a gun?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.758
Heather, tell them
I wouldn't bring a gun!

23:29.760 --> 23:31.120
No!

23:42.240 --> 23:43.878
I'm just so happy to be alive.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.238
To think she was coming
for me this whole time.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.878
Oh, I think the note was actually
directed toward all of us, Pauline.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.758
I don't see what she'd
want with you, Maurice,

23:51.760 --> 23:53.598
but, you know, if that's
what you need to process this...

23:53.600 --> 23:55.078
You're a sick woman.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.958
I heard her whole closet
was filled with grenades

23:56.960 --> 24:00.278
and she was gonna chuck them at us
until we all exploded into a fiery mess.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.798
Rad.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.720
"Never tell a lie," says
Ohio's biggest liar.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.440
JD?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.200
A word.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.480
I know what you've been up to, JD.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.718
You smell like cigarettes
and beef jerky.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.278
You're sleeping with my stepmom.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.038
I really don't have time
for this, Heather.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.398
I don't know what kind of game
you think you're playing, JD,

24:35.400 --> 24:39.438
but trust me, your STDs
are no match for her STDs.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.920
Wow, okay. I am not
sleeping with Jade, Heather.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.798
Wait.
Are you confronting me about this

24:47.800 --> 24:51.358
-because you're concerned for Veronica?
-No.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.878
Is Heather Duke showing
concern for her friend?

24:54.880 --> 24:56.320
How dare you?

25:00.920 --> 25:02.838
Okay.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.160
Fine.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.078
Just...

25:07.080 --> 25:10.080
promise me you'd never
break Veronica's heart.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.638
I promise, Heather.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.118
Good.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.358
Because I've invested
a lot in blouses this season,

25:19.360 --> 25:22.798
and I can't have her ruining them
by crying her dollar-store mascara

25:22.800 --> 25:24.598
onto my well-tailored shoulder.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.560
Sorry, your bruise is bugging me.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.840
Your eyes are so empty.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.680
Jealous.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.198
Oh, you can do better than that, Dad.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.278
I wouldn't want to hurt my son.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.478
Pain is what makes us stronger.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.518
Is that what your
failed generation believes?

25:48.520 --> 25:50.118
At least we believe in something.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.680
Like lies.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.838
Just like all our founding fathers.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.398
Better than nothing at all.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.878
Is it?

25:58.880 --> 26:03.000
Aren't you supposed to be the generation
that changed a nation founded on lies?

26:07.880 --> 26:10.760
And then we had to get jobs, unlike you.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.918
That little girlfriend of yours
is making you weak.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.158
She's already cracking the whip, huh?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.678
At least with your mom,
it took a few years before...

26:22.680 --> 26:24.440
she lopped my balls off.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.000
I love our quality time, JD.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.000
I'll be in my room.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.678
-JD?
-Veronica.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.958
-Your dad let me in.
-What's wrong?

27:18.960 --> 27:20.280
Look.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.480
-Who's doing this?
-I'll take care of her.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.200
Oh, Heather.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.400
Heather, I know you're in here.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.640
This explains so much.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.040
Oh, shit.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.440
Wondering why it smelled
like a boy band tour bus in here!

29:08.280 --> 29:10.238
What are you doing in my house?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.840
Shit.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.478
We had a deal, Heather!

29:20.480 --> 29:22.998
And what does that have to do with you
breaking into my house, you psycho?

29:23.000 --> 29:26.920
I already killed you once.
I really hate having to repeat myself.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.680
Burn, bitch.

30:18.920 --> 30:22.758
Come on, Heather. Say one
of your clever burns and finish me.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.120
Gladly.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.078
Ah, the irony of killing you
with your own second-place trophy.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.878
-What the hell do you want?
-I want you to stop texting me!

31:11.880 --> 31:13.358
Texting you?

31:13.360 --> 31:16.360
JD, I would never darken my contacts
with your phone number.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.520
Shit.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.238
It wasn't you.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.520
Oh, my God. Literally
everybody is obsessed with me.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.320
What is...

31:57.000 --> 31:58.440
What the...

32:12.240 --> 32:16.438
<i>"Dear Diary, by now, if everything's</i>
<i>gone according to plan,</i>

32:16.440 --> 32:18.520
<i>JD should be reading this.</i>

32:20.360 --> 32:24.518
<i>If only he'd even once stopped and</i>
<i>looked at things from my point of view,</i>

32:24.520 --> 32:26.760
<i>I wouldn't have to do this.</i>

32:27.840 --> 32:29.918
<i>But he didn't.</i>

32:29.920 --> 32:32.520
<i>And so now he's left me no choice.</i>

32:33.720 --> 32:35.560
<i>I thought he was different, Diary.</i>

32:36.840 --> 32:38.878
<i>I thought JD could see that...</i>

32:38.880 --> 32:41.398
<i>I wasn't just some nobody,</i>

32:41.400 --> 32:43.200
<i>some nothing.</i>

32:44.120 --> 32:45.680
<i>I thought he saw...</i>

32:47.760 --> 32:50.838
<i>the real Veronica Sawyer.</i>

32:50.840 --> 32:53.038
<i>But he did what everyone does to me,</i>

32:53.040 --> 32:55.078
<i>just see what they want to see.</i>

32:55.080 --> 32:57.238
<i>The sweet girl, the relatable girl,</i>

32:57.240 --> 32:59.320
<i>the girl that you can see yourself in.</i>

33:01.120 --> 33:03.238
<i>Well, fuck that.</i>

33:03.240 --> 33:06.118
<i>I'm not here for you,</i>
<i>I'm not here for them,</i>

33:06.120 --> 33:09.558
<i>and I am certainly not here</i>
<i>for some stupid guy.</i>

33:09.560 --> 33:13.038
<i>And if only JD had paid attention,</i>

33:13.040 --> 33:15.078
<i>he'd know what I was capable of,</i>

33:15.080 --> 33:19.078
<i>but instead, he chose to kiss</i>
<i>Betty fucking Finn, and then worse,</i>

33:19.080 --> 33:23.078
<i>lie about it,</i>
<i>just like General Westerburg.</i>

33:23.080 --> 33:25.678
<i>A lie is a lie is a lie,</i>

33:25.680 --> 33:29.118
<i>and if JD thought that guy</i>
<i>had to pay for being a liar</i>

33:29.120 --> 33:32.278
<i>by blowing up his stupid statue...</i>

33:32.280 --> 33:36.280
<i>then JD should have to pay</i>
<i>for being a liar too."</i>

34:44.679 --> 34:47.239
You shouldn't have lied
about kissing Betty.
