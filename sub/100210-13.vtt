00:01.335 --> 00:03.471
LAINEY: Back in the '90s,
there was no
bigger blockbuster

00:03.504 --> 00:05.439
than James Cameron's
Titanic,

00:05.473 --> 00:08.909
but it was the love story
between Jack and Rose
that captivated the nation.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.112
Some people saw it
30 times in the theater.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.813
As for me, I only saw it 29.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.649
I'm the king
of the world!

00:15.683 --> 00:18.619
Naturally,
a movie this huge had
famous lines everyone quoted.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.687
Like this.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.789
I'm the king of the world!

00:21.822 --> 00:24.158
(LAUGHTER)
Like, from
the Titanic movie.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.160
LAINEY: It became
the funniest joke
on the planet...

00:26.194 --> 00:28.329
I'm the king of the world!

00:28.362 --> 00:29.863
...until it was
totally played out.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.066
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

00:33.167 --> 00:34.235
From Titanic.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.004
Wait, am I not funny?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.807
I was so infatuated,
I even took CB to see it.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.309
Titanic is gonna
blow your mind, dude.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.843
It's the world's
greatest love story

00:42.876 --> 00:44.778
and disaster film
all rolled into one.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.148
Eh, for me,
love is always a disaster,

00:47.181 --> 00:49.683
so maybe instead of
seeing sad old Titanic,

00:49.717 --> 00:53.621
we take a trip
into the future with...

00:53.654 --> 00:55.022
The Fifth Element.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.091
Bruce Willis drives
a flying taxi cab.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.692
Trust me,
watching Jack and Rose

00:58.726 --> 01:00.994
is exactly what you need
to believe in love again.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.531
But turns out,
even the most epic
of love stories

01:03.564 --> 01:04.865
couldn't change CB's mind.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.500
And it also didn't help
that I kept bringing up Barry

01:06.534 --> 01:08.202
the whole three hours.

01:08.236 --> 01:11.372
(SOBBING) I don't know
what I'd do if I lost Barry.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.873
I just love him so much.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.876
Yeah. That is my one
takeaway from the movie.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.345
Tissue?

01:17.378 --> 01:20.581
No. I'll just cry alone
in my car later.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.351
'Cause love sucks.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.254
* One of these days
you're gonna get outta here

01:26.287 --> 01:29.190
* Live your life
and finally be free

01:29.223 --> 01:32.160
* Go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do

01:32.193 --> 01:36.029
* Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" *

01:36.063 --> 01:38.432
LAINEY: It was January 29th,
1990-something,

01:38.466 --> 01:40.468
and school spirit
was at an all-time high.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.036
Oh, man. Which sport
is this one for?

01:43.070 --> 01:44.305
Oh, we're just
getting pumped up

01:44.338 --> 01:47.074
for the big
WP/GA Day football game.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.276
WP/GA wha?

01:48.309 --> 01:50.644
Oh. I keep forgetting
you're new here.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.880
Follow me. This will only
take 20 to 30 minutes.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.015
Is there a version
where I just say "Got it"

01:55.048 --> 01:56.083
and we move on?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.286
It was a crisp autumn day
in 1887.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.453
Ah, sonuvabitch.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.955
A brash young Quaker
named Wilbur Smedley

02:01.989 --> 02:05.025
challenged a young German
settler named Hans Schneider

02:05.058 --> 02:06.294
to a friendly game
of pigskin.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.795
Naturally,
the Germans cheated,

02:07.828 --> 02:10.264
resulting in the most heated
feud in football history.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.900
So, like every team that plays
sports, you have a rivalry.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.468
No, not just any rivalry.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.970
This is the oldest rivalry
in the entire sport.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.673
It's older than anything
in the NFL or college.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.343
Explains why Rick's been
stress eating whole artichokes

02:22.376 --> 02:23.444
in the teacher's lounge.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.512
Yep, every year
it's all up to him

02:24.545 --> 02:25.613
to bring us back
this bad boy.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.682
The Quaker Cup. That trophy
is Rick's life force.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.285
Thanks to him,
we've had this cup
for 14 straight years.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.021
Go on.
Give history a feel.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.791
Who touched the trophy?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.159
No one, pal!

02:39.193 --> 02:40.628
I heard a ting.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.695
No ting.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.931
It was a very faint
but distinct ting.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.799
LAINEY: Coach was on edge,
and it got worse

02:45.833 --> 02:47.635
when Ronnie suffered
a terrible injury.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.702
Turf toe?

02:48.736 --> 02:50.838
Turf toe, Coach.
I can't walk.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.940
From turf toe? C'mon!
It's just turf toe!

02:52.973 --> 02:54.174
Terrible turf toe.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.876
How terrible
can turf toe be?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.179
(PLAYERS GROANING)
Oh! Gah!

02:59.213 --> 03:01.482
Not gonna lie, Ronnie,
that's some terrible turf toe.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.950
(RETCHES)

03:02.983 --> 03:04.518
It's like a foot-colored
clown shoe.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.619
(RETCHES)

03:05.653 --> 03:06.987
ALEC: We're so boned!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.189
Ronnie's passing game
was the only shot we had
at winning.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.924
Coach always has
a game plan.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.493
Reza, you're starting QB.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.727
(PLAYERS GROAN)

03:13.761 --> 03:14.995
Hey... (RETCHES)

03:15.028 --> 03:16.530
Knock it off!
We're a team!

03:16.564 --> 03:17.831
No, they're right, Coach.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.800
We'll never beat Germantown
if I'm QB.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.469
Yeah, well, lucky for us,
we got something

03:21.502 --> 03:24.505
Germantown'll never have...
And that's a Coach Mellor.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.307
And he always gets the win.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.341
Reza, hit me!

03:29.076 --> 03:30.511
LAINEY: The team
was in shambles,

03:30.544 --> 03:32.380
and I was trying to
knock some sense into CB.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.282
Seriously, if this is
how you really feel,

03:34.315 --> 03:35.583
I don't know how
we can even be friends.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.050
I have a right
to my own opinion.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.752
Not if your opinion
is dumb and wrong.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.020
That's not
how opinions work.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.122
Guys! I don't know what
you two are fighting about,

03:42.155 --> 03:43.424
but we've all agreed,
no talking politics

03:43.457 --> 03:44.758
up in the teacher's lounge.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.427
Politics? We're talking
about Titanic.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.761
CB said the movie sucked.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.197
Oh. Well, in that case,
yeah, CB's opinion
is dumb and wrong.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.565
I mean, when that
old white lady

03:51.599 --> 03:53.967
dropped that diamond necklace
back in the water...

03:54.001 --> 03:55.869
(SIGHS)
...that really moved me, man.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.137
You mean moved you to anger

03:57.170 --> 03:59.507
'cause she threw away
$100 million for no reason?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.409
She was letting go
of the past or something!

04:01.442 --> 04:03.143
It made sense at the time!

04:03.176 --> 04:05.579
Easy, big guy. Maybe CB just
needs to see it again.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.015
Face it, Kate Winslet
let Leo freeze

04:08.048 --> 04:10.318
so she could
save her own butt,
just like anyone else would.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.052
Who hurt you?
Who what?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.854
There's gotta be a reason
why you hate love.

04:13.887 --> 04:14.922
Tell me her name.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.390
(CHUCKLING) Never!

04:16.424 --> 04:20.160
And how exactly is it love
when a lady lets a dude die
of hypothermia?

04:20.193 --> 04:23.163
Um, I'm sorry,
Leo sacrificed himself
for love

04:23.196 --> 04:24.732
'cause the door
was too tiny!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.634
What kind of munchkin cruise
do you think they were on?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.569
There was ample room
on that door!

04:28.602 --> 04:32.039
A floating door can
only hold one human person.
It's science.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.474
Too bad there's no way
to prove it.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.076
Actually, there is,
with a simple small-scale
science experiment.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.645
Get ready to
believe in love, sucka!

04:37.678 --> 04:39.413
Wilma,
to the science lab!

04:40.781 --> 04:43.083
All right, Quaker warriors!
Change of plans!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.619
Today we are scrimmaging
against the JV squad.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.120
Why don't we just come up
with some new plays

04:47.154 --> 04:48.722
so Germantown
doesn't totally smoke us?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.824
Why don't you
shut your face holes,

04:50.858 --> 04:53.594
because I am the coach
and I'm sick
of your back talk!

04:53.627 --> 04:55.529
Now, I'm not one to
stand up here

04:55.563 --> 04:57.965
and give big speeches,
but now I'm mad!

04:57.998 --> 05:01.134
LAINEY: But, in fact,
epic locker room speeches
were Coach's specialty.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.803
He had them down to a science

05:02.836 --> 05:04.738
and always began with
the angry jug kick.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.839
Ahhh!
(JUG CLATTERS)

05:05.873 --> 05:07.140
I can't take it no more!

05:07.174 --> 05:09.276
For once in your lives,
stop worrying about them

05:09.309 --> 05:11.211
and focus on your
own damn selves!

05:11.244 --> 05:13.013
LAINEY: Followed by
the heartfelt apology.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.315
Well, Coach is sorry
you had to see that.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.419
It's just...
Coach believes in y'all
so damn much

05:18.452 --> 05:21.021
that sometimes Coach
can't contain it.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.123
LAINEY: Then came the classic
"I quit" maneuver.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.393
That's it! I'm done!

05:25.426 --> 05:27.695
I quit! I'm out!

05:28.462 --> 05:30.163
You did this!
Happy?

05:30.197 --> 05:34.034
And, of course, the triumphant
return five seconds later.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.936
After much soul-searching,
I'm back,

05:35.969 --> 05:38.406
and, damn it, I'm fired up!

05:38.439 --> 05:40.874
Now who's ready to get
fired up with me?

05:40.908 --> 05:42.443
JV shrimps are
going down!

05:42.476 --> 05:43.711
ALL: Yeah!

05:43.744 --> 05:47.114
Wow, you sure got them
to bounce back fast
after losing Ronnie.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.716
Coach always has
a game plan.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.183
First, I fire 'em up,

05:50.217 --> 05:52.019
then I boost their confidence
with a much-needed win.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.120
(CHUCKLES)

05:53.153 --> 05:54.522
(THUDDING)
(PLAYERS GROANING)

05:54.555 --> 05:55.623
Rick, they didn't win.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.257
(GRUNTS)

05:57.290 --> 05:58.892
They did not.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.327
My house!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.863
Well, I'm sure you're already
cooking up a new game plan.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.031
That, I am. Yes.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.366
And my new plan is to...

06:06.400 --> 06:08.436
Go think of a new plan.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.604
I'm gonna go stress eat
this entire avocado

06:10.638 --> 06:12.540
until the plan comes to me.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.509
LAINEY: As Coach
doubted himself
for the first time ever,

06:15.543 --> 06:18.045
I was certain Wilma would
change CB's stance on love.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.615
Okay, as you can see,
I've built a to-scale
recreation

06:21.649 --> 06:23.216
of a floating door scenario.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.619
Leonardo DiCaprio
will be the Power Ranger,

06:25.653 --> 06:27.555
and Kate Winslet
is the Mutant Turtle.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.656
I hate to be that guy,

06:28.689 --> 06:30.824
but the Turtle's actual name
is Leonardo,

06:30.858 --> 06:32.059
so it'd make more sense to...

06:32.092 --> 06:34.194
If you hate to be that guy,
stop doing what you're doing.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.363
WILMA: As you can see,
our miniature oak door

06:36.396 --> 06:38.666
allows us to determine if its
buoyancy is greater than

06:38.699 --> 06:39.933
the force of gravity
pulling down on the...

06:39.967 --> 06:41.469
Yeah, we don't need
the play-by-play.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.471
Just do your science
and tell CB love isn't dead.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.106
Then scientifically speaking,
love is dead as hell.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.374
Ha! Told ya!

06:47.407 --> 06:48.476
Wait, what?

06:48.509 --> 06:51.745
There is an embarrassing
amount of room on this door.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.046
No. Wrong.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.415
Hey, Wilma, is there a world
where love is such a sham

06:55.449 --> 06:58.085
that Rose, Jack, and me
could fit on that door?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.853
With 100% certainty.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.889
Observe.
There I am.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.191
Is there a world where love
is such a suck show

07:04.224 --> 07:07.895
where Rose, Jack,
me, and you
fit on that door?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.963
WILMA: Yes. Agreed?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.431
Agreed.
Permission to gloat?

07:11.465 --> 07:12.533
Permission granted.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.867
Told ya!
Wrong.

07:13.901 --> 07:14.968
I refute these findings.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.436
Excuse me?
You heard me.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.739
Your experiment is wrong,
and you do science bad.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.208
I graduated first in my class
at Caltech.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.944
You really think I can't prove
a slab of wood can float?

07:23.977 --> 07:26.113
You didn't factor in the most
important scientific element.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.249
Love.
Love is an emotion,

07:29.282 --> 07:31.251
which is
the opposite of science.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.053
Ha!
Permission to high-five?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.522
Allowed.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.089
Don't high-five
against love!

07:36.123 --> 07:37.525
Some things are bigger
than science,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.159
no matter what
your experiment suggests.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.795
My experiment doesn't
suggest anything.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.131
It proves all Rose had to do
was scoot over,

07:44.164 --> 07:45.899
but she didn't,
'cause she wanted

07:45.933 --> 07:47.735
that big-ass door
all to herself.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.570
Copy that. Love is a sham.
We're done here.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.404
No, we're not.
Just tell me who hurt you.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.473
No!
Gimme her name,
and I will fight her.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.742
That would be weird.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.710
And also, why does it matter
so much to you?

07:56.744 --> 07:58.912
Because you're one of
my best friends, dude.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.648
I want you to be happy,
but it'll never happen

08:00.681 --> 08:02.182
if you go through life
hating love.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.585
Well, your best dude friend
appreciates the concern.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.587
However, I will be siding
with science on this one.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.156
Wilma, permission to
give you a fist bump
and clean up this mess?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.190
Allowed.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.426
(SIGHS) My God.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.028
You two callous nerds
deserve each other.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.164
Charlie Brown,
of course.
I love that.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.466
You really
do deserve each other.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.668
(BOTH LAUGH)

08:20.701 --> 08:22.235
Whoa! Oh, shoot.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.938
It's perfect.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.610
The Titanic experiment
hadn't gone my way,

08:29.643 --> 08:32.312
but now I had a new plan to
help CB believe in love.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.480
What up, playa?

08:33.513 --> 08:34.682
No. Stop.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.017
Whatever scheme you got
cooking up, it's a hard pass.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.151
No scheme.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.187
Except maybe a small scheme
for you to open your heart.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.155
Ugh! Fine. You win.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.324
I loved James Cameron's
Titanic, okay?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.493
It's his greatest movie yet,
other than Aliens.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.828
And True Lies.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.029
No, wait.
Terminator 2.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.530
It's not about Titanic.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.765
It's about you being happy

08:51.799 --> 08:53.934
and forgetting about
the hag who broke your heart.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.303
I'm here.
Give your heart to me.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.538
You really don't have
the details of my situation.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.941
Doesn't matter. Clearly,
there's only one gal for you.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.610
Wilma.
Wilma?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.011
You have so much
in common.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.713
You both love teaching,
and books,

09:05.746 --> 09:07.247
and Wayne Brady,
for some reason.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.548
Plus, you're annoying
know-it-alls.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.683
It's a perfect match!

09:09.717 --> 09:11.885
First of all,
Wilma terrifies me.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.887
Second,
she only likes bad boys.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.256
That's just an excuse
so she doesn't have to
put herself out there.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.225
See? Another weird thing
you have in common.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.893
You're really not gonna
give up on this, are you?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.495
God, no. I've mapped out
a very detailed six-phase plan

09:22.529 --> 09:24.231
to help you find
the courage to ask her out.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.365
Yo, Wilma,
do you wanna go out?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.667
Nah.
Cool.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.968
Come on!
CB's the best!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.970
Any girl in this place
would be lucky to date him.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.271
First of all,
I terrify him.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.372
I tried to tell her.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.374
Secondly,
I only like bad boys.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.542
I tried to tell her.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.511
And I told you
that's just a bad excuse
to hide from love.

09:38.545 --> 09:41.548
Yo, I don't know whose burrito
exploded in the microwave,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.083
but I will kick his ass.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.284
Spread the word.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.585
Mmm.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.055
Ew. Don't "Mmm"
Johnny Atkins.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.289
I know.
I got a problem.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.391
Okay, so you like
gross bad boys.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.826
I did, too,
before I met Barry,

09:52.860 --> 09:54.461
but then I realized
how happy life can be

09:54.494 --> 09:56.263
when you have someone
amazing to share it with.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.398
If I take the kid to a movie,
will you shut up?

09:58.431 --> 10:01.534
Done! Wow, look!
Sparks are flying already! Ha!

10:01.568 --> 10:03.570
**

10:03.603 --> 10:04.772
(THUD)

10:05.338 --> 10:06.406
Mmm.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.808
This is gonna be fun.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.243
LAINEY: As I was
playing matchmaker,
Glascott was making sure

10:10.277 --> 10:12.412
Coach was okay
after the JV fiasco.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.613
Hey, pal.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.615
Just checking in on ya
after your tough loss

10:15.649 --> 10:17.184
to your own JV team.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.886
Feeling good,
Johnny Boy!

10:18.919 --> 10:20.788
As always,
I worked out a new game plan

10:20.821 --> 10:22.189
that guarantees us the win.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.258
Guarantees? I like
the sound of that. Hit me.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.260
We swap jerseys
with Germantown,

10:27.294 --> 10:29.797
and every time they score,
we get the points!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.498
Mmm, seems like a reach.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.599
New plan!

10:32.632 --> 10:34.501
We hire David Copperfield
to make

10:34.534 --> 10:38.471
the entire Germantown team...
Poof! Disappear!

10:38.505 --> 10:39.773
Maybe you should
get some sleep.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.141
But I've got
the longest winning streak

10:41.174 --> 10:42.910
in the oldest rivalry
in the history of football,

10:42.943 --> 10:45.112
so losing
is not an option!

10:45.145 --> 10:46.980
Y'know,
sometimes when you lose,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.581
you still learn
a valuable lesson,

10:48.615 --> 10:50.450
which really makes it
a win.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.786
How can you lose
but also win? (CHUCKLES)

10:52.820 --> 10:54.287
'Cause teaching them
to lose like winners

10:54.321 --> 10:56.089
is just as important
as winning itself.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.792
But a loser
can't be a winner,
'cause he lost.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.593
Rick, I'm trying to
help you here.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.663
New plan!
We build a wall on the field,

11:03.697 --> 11:07.134
and on said wall, we paint
a photo-realistic image

11:07.167 --> 11:08.435
of our end zone,

11:08.468 --> 11:11.604
so every time they come in
to score, kaboom!

11:11.638 --> 11:14.241
They hit a big ol' wall!
(CHUCKLES)

11:14.274 --> 11:15.943
Yeah, that's from
a Road Runner cartoon.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.010
New plan!

11:17.044 --> 11:18.678
Okay,
get some sleep, Coach.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.013
LAINEY:
That conversation was over,

11:20.047 --> 11:21.982
but CB and Wilma's date
was just starting.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.917
Here you go.
Lainey bought us
tickets already.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.253
Titanic?
We both already saw it.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.688
Well, she said maybe
if we saw it together,
we'd appreciate it more.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.857
And also fall in love.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.524
I can't sit through
a damn three-hour movie.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.926
I got a date after this.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.327
Oh, good for you!
Good guy?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.363
Not at all.
Total dirtbag lawyer.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.098
No future there.
He's perfect.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.566
You got problems.
Sure do.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.734
Let's just
sneak into something else.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.102
I'm dying to see
The Fifth Element.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.971
Oh, never heard of it.
Do you like science fiction?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.039
Well, I like science.
It's got Bruce Willis.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.042
Is he all sweaty and beaten-up
in a dirty undershirt?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.643
You've got problems.
Sure do.

11:50.677 --> 11:51.711
Let's hit it.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.580
LAINEY: And so began
CB and Wilma's non-date

11:53.613 --> 11:55.715
in a movie
that they naturally assumed

11:55.749 --> 11:58.685
would be the exact opposite
of Titanic.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.687
Except it had a cruise ship.
In space.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.423
It was also
a passionate love story...

12:03.991 --> 12:05.225
In space.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.427
And, unlike Titanic,
this movie

12:07.460 --> 12:09.396
cracked his heart wide open.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.231
(SOBS)

12:12.465 --> 12:16.069
I don't know if this
was clear, but the fifth
element was love.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.439
That's how you
make a love story
and disaster movie.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.975
Listen, I said yes
to this whole thing
'cause I want to help.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.011
You really are a good guy.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.013
You just can't be so afraid
of getting hurt...

12:26.046 --> 12:27.614
And try to put yourself
out there.

12:27.647 --> 12:28.782
I know.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.583
To be clear...

12:30.617 --> 12:32.185
I know
the hurt is Lainey.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.954
No... How?

12:33.987 --> 12:37.390
You told Susan Cinoman,
Coop, and Mellor,
and, boy, do they talk.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.725
So you're saying that
the only person

12:38.758 --> 12:39.927
who doesn't know this
is Lainey?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.628
That is very concerning
in my bones.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.031
Good news is,
Lainey has no idea
'cause she only sees you

12:44.064 --> 12:46.366
as a platonic,
non-sexual man-friend.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.600
Not totally non-sexual.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.702
I have that one soft,
silky satin tie.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.538
Point is,
you can't give up on love

12:51.571 --> 12:53.540
just because
you can't be with Lainey.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.243
You deserve to be happy,
but that will never happen

12:56.276 --> 12:58.611
if you don't move on
once and for all.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.646
You're right.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.748
As hard as it may seem...

13:02.582 --> 13:03.783
I got to move on.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.586
Thanks for the awesome date,
Wilma.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.521
Not a date.
But anytime.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.091
Speaking of,
time to go meet
my dirt-bag lawyer!

13:11.124 --> 13:12.592
**

13:13.560 --> 13:15.295
Morning, boss.
Hey!

13:15.328 --> 13:17.831
Look at you.
Feeling better, huh?
Better than ever.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.666
Had a big moment
of clarity last night

13:19.699 --> 13:21.234
and finally
figured it out.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.535
Ooh! How to win?

13:22.569 --> 13:23.636
Oh, God, no!

13:23.670 --> 13:26.940
See, I figured out
that I don't actually matter.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.075
Boom!

13:28.108 --> 13:30.243
I'm sorry, but you're saying
that like it's a good thing.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.745
No, it's not.
It's soul-crushing.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.615
See, I realized that
no matter what I do,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.317
we're gonna lose,
which really means

13:37.350 --> 13:40.253
that I serve
no actual purpose.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.422
Okay, you're using
a very chipper tone,

13:42.455 --> 13:44.391
but the words you say
sound sad.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.825
I'm devastated!

13:45.859 --> 13:48.128
See, I always thought
that I was the one
that got the win,

13:48.161 --> 13:49.496
but turns out,
it's not me.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.464
It's the actual players!

13:51.498 --> 13:53.233
Whoo! Good stuff!

13:53.266 --> 13:54.434
Wrong.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.836
It's a fact,
only a great coach
can make a great team.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.405
Let's talk facts.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.040
Who scores
all the touchdowns?

14:00.073 --> 14:02.709
The players.
And who sacks
the quarterback?

14:02.742 --> 14:03.810
The players.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.346
And in our game
against Germantown last year,

14:06.379 --> 14:09.416
who told our quarterback
to go no huddle on third down

14:09.449 --> 14:10.683
and pass for the win?

14:10.717 --> 14:12.986
A-ha! That's you!
Correct!

14:13.020 --> 14:15.488
But then Ronnie called an
audible and ran it in himself,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.158
and I just stood there
and I watched!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.659
At the end of the day,

14:19.692 --> 14:22.195
me and my whistle
don't do a damn thing.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.064
No, Rick, do not
take that whistle off.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.732
Whistle's off.
Take it.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.367
But it's
your main coach tool.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.701
Doesn't matter what I use.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.004
Let's face it,
nothing I do
makes a difference.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.305
**

14:34.241 --> 14:35.375
Why is it wet?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.513
LAINEY: It had been a day
since Coach handed over
his whistle to Glascott,

14:40.547 --> 14:41.915
but it was far from over.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.850
Boss, we got
a huge problem!

14:43.883 --> 14:45.185
I told you, Johnny,
you're the one
with the rubber gloves.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.353
You handle it.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.587
No, it's the Quaker Cup.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.389
It's gone.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.657
That's impossible!

14:50.690 --> 14:53.226
Mellor checks on that trophy
once an hour on the hour.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.163
Oh, no.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.697
Oh, God, no, Rick, no!

14:57.730 --> 14:58.765
Oh, no!

14:58.798 --> 15:00.567
Don't look at me.
I'm hideous.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.635
Put that spoon down
right now!

15:02.669 --> 15:04.337
Let me say goodbye to
my trophy in peace!

15:04.371 --> 15:05.405
No!

15:05.438 --> 15:06.940
Do you know how many times
you've picked me up

15:06.974 --> 15:09.009
when I felt like
I was bad at my job?

15:09.042 --> 15:11.744
Like, a lot.
Like, way too many times.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.846
Like, so much that it's
a bummer to even think about.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.648
It does seem to happen
with great frequency.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.484
We both agree
it's an alarming amount!

15:17.517 --> 15:19.386
Point is,
you've always picked me up

15:19.419 --> 15:21.354
when I felt like
I was bad at my job,

15:21.388 --> 15:23.823
and now it's time for me
to give you

15:23.856 --> 15:26.493
an inspirational
locker room pep talk.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.195
LAINEY: That day,
John Glascott gave

15:28.228 --> 15:30.063
the greatest
Rick Mellor speech
of his life.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.132
Naturally, it began with
the angry jug kick.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.933
I'm tired of your
defeated attitude

15:33.967 --> 15:36.303
and your sad
dairy consumption!

15:36.336 --> 15:39.406
You may wanna give up,
but I refuse to give up
on you!

15:39.973 --> 15:41.308
Aah! Ow!

15:41.341 --> 15:42.909
LAINEY: Followed by
the heartfelt apology.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.844
I'm sorry
you had to see that.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.913
It's just that
I care so much.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.115
Especially in my foot,

15:48.148 --> 15:50.450
which hurts so bad
that I may throw up.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.419
LAINEY: Then the classic
"I quit" maneuver.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.121
You wanna just
throw in the towel?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.622
Then I will, too!

15:55.655 --> 15:56.923
I quit!

15:56.956 --> 15:58.325
That's on your head!

15:58.358 --> 16:00.160
You did this!

16:00.193 --> 16:01.961
LAINEY: And then
the triumphant return.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.231
Hey, look, it's me.
I'm back.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.299
And I believe in you
more than ever.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.800
LAINEY: None of it worked,
so he went rogue.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.902
Listen up,
you sack of (BLEEP)!

16:09.936 --> 16:12.339
Stop acting like
a sorry-ass (BLEEP)

16:12.372 --> 16:15.742
and get your head
in the (BLEEP) game,
for (BLEEP) sake!

16:15.775 --> 16:18.078
Whoa! Stop! What's
the matter with you, man?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.480
I don't know.
I... I'm not good at this.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.415
Is that what I sound like when
I'm giving a pep talk?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.085
Oh, God. I'm more
useless than I thought.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.454
You're not useless, Rick.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.989
Okay, so, maybe
you don't actually

16:30.023 --> 16:31.624
make the players
win the game,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.560
but, honestly,
that's not your job.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.095
Of course it is.
No.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.830
Your job is to teach
those kids that even
when they lose,

16:37.864 --> 16:39.632
they can still
feel like winners.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.301
You're right.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.770
And ya know...

16:43.803 --> 16:47.274
I actually think I have a plan
that just may work.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.608
All right, Quaker warriors.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.343
Huddle up.
We got a big game today.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.145
No more pep talks, Coach.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.946
There's no point
in trying to convince us

16:53.980 --> 16:55.282
we can actually
beat Germantown.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.516
Agreed!

16:56.549 --> 17:00.653
Look, I'm not one
to get up here
and make big speeches,

17:00.687 --> 17:03.390
but like it or not,
we got a game to play.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.358
But we can still find
a way to win.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.393
How?

17:07.260 --> 17:08.495
We do everything
in our power

17:08.528 --> 17:11.464
to make sure this game
isn't a total blowout.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.032
But that means
we still lose.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.135
But we do it with dignity.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.338
I know you're all thinking
we're gonna lose
by at least 50.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.972
Well, guess what.

17:20.006 --> 17:24.477
I know in my heart
that we can lose
by just 49!

17:24.511 --> 17:25.778
That's impossible, Coach.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.414
Is it, Ronnie?

17:27.447 --> 17:28.948
Reza, we all agree
you're gonna throw

17:28.981 --> 17:30.950
a minimum
of nine interceptions.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.986
But if you can
throw just four,
that's a win.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.988
The biggest.
Is it even possible?

17:36.022 --> 17:37.724
Hell yes!

17:37.757 --> 17:39.859
I know our defensive line
is as thin as paper,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.794
but I say
be thick as cardboard!

17:41.828 --> 17:44.664
And I know our running backs
are as slow as molasses,

17:44.697 --> 17:47.267
but I say be maple syrup!

17:47.300 --> 17:49.202
And if you're gonna
sloppily fumble the ball,

17:49.236 --> 17:50.970
you do it
with your head held high!

17:51.003 --> 17:52.672
Am I right?
PLAYERS: Yeah!

17:52.705 --> 17:54.741
Are you ready to go out there
and show Germantown

17:54.774 --> 17:57.076
that no matter
how many points they score,

17:57.110 --> 17:59.212
we draw the line at 50?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.980
ALL: Yeah!

18:01.013 --> 18:03.250
Well, then let's get out there
and get our asses kicked,

18:03.283 --> 18:05.818
but not as badly
as everybody expects!

18:05.852 --> 18:06.919
ALL: Yeah!

18:07.487 --> 18:08.855
**

18:08.888 --> 18:10.257
(CHEERING)

18:10.290 --> 18:11.591
(BUZZER)

18:11.624 --> 18:13.893
We did it!
We only lost by 49!

18:13.926 --> 18:15.628
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18:16.929 --> 18:20.900
* ...forever this way

18:20.933 --> 18:22.702
* You are safe... *

18:22.735 --> 18:24.171
You do know
we won, right?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.905
Only according
to the scoreboard.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.775
Here.
I believe this is yours.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.876
Take good care of her.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.715
LAINEY: That day,
Coach won the biggest game
of his career.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.285
Sure, the team may have lost
in epic fashion,

18:38.318 --> 18:40.853
but in doing so,
they learned
a valuable lesson...

18:40.887 --> 18:43.790
If you always try your best,
you'll never be disappointed.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.958
Well?
How was the big date?

18:45.992 --> 18:47.260
I need details, now.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.061
Uh, y'know,
you were right.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.930
It really was exactly
what I needed.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.499
As in sparks?
You and Wilma had sparks?

18:52.532 --> 18:53.933
Oh, God, no. No.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.403
But it made me realize
that maybe love

18:56.436 --> 18:58.638
isn't a sinking ship,
and to give it another shot.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.072
Awesome.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.942
And for the record, whoever
that girl was that hurt you,
she's an idiot.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.477
She's actually
pretty great.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.479
(GROANS)
You're too nice.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.747
So are you.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.917
I mean, you let me
crash on your couch
for the last month.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.985
But I should
probably start looking
for my own place.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.987
Really?
There's no rush.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.524
I know,
but it's time to move on.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.493
Thank you for being
the best damn best friend
in the world.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.528
Always.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.932
Turns out, CB did
believe in love after all.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.300
He just needed a little proof

19:27.334 --> 19:28.968
from the people
who care about him.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.238
Seriously, still trying to
refute my findings?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.405
Sorry.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.707
I just can't get over knowing
there was room on the door.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.943
Just say it.
Wilma is always right.

19:36.976 --> 19:37.977
You really are.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.480
I mean, you went on
one non-date with CB,

19:40.513 --> 19:41.781
and now
he's all happy again.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.915
What did you even
say to him?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.817
Just helped him figure out
a way to move on.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.553
**

19:53.826 --> 19:55.528
It's time I move on.

19:56.363 --> 20:00.333
* We'll stay

20:00.367 --> 20:04.637
* Forever this way

20:04.671 --> 20:08.808
* You are safe in my heart

20:08.841 --> 20:14.981
* And my heart
will go on and on... *

20:15.014 --> 20:16.182
Oh, my God.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.784
I'm the girl.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.988
I'm the girl.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.493
Life can throw some huge
surprises at us.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.361
But if you have the people
who care about you

20:28.395 --> 20:29.762
there to support you,

20:29.796 --> 20:33.132
you'll always
find a way to win.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.734

(SCREAMING)

20:48.648 --> 20:52.151
Starting today,
this school has a strict
zero-tolerance policy

20:52.184 --> 20:54.721
for "King of the world'ing"
in any of its forms.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.390
You think it's fun
to pull a Jack?
Well, it's not!

20:57.424 --> 21:00.693
Do not Jack in the hallways
or Jack in the parking lot.
(LAUGHTER)

21:00.727 --> 21:02.729
Do not Jack near your locker.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.931
Do not Jack
near your friend's locker.

21:04.964 --> 21:08.100
And please, for God's sakes,
do not pull a quick Jack

21:08.134 --> 21:10.970
with the skeleton
in science class.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.872
Yeah, that's right,
we all heard!

21:12.905 --> 21:13.973
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

21:14.006 --> 21:15.775
Hey, boss!
Sorry to miss the assembly.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.544
Just rigging this beauty up
for the sailing team.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.978
Also, look at me!

21:19.011 --> 21:20.347
Oh, God,
no, no, no, no!

21:20.380 --> 21:21.881
No Jacking
in the parking lot!

21:21.914 --> 21:23.282
No, no!
Look away, children!

21:23.316 --> 21:25.385
I'm the king of the world!
No!
