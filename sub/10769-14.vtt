WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:05.329
Ah, ha, ha!

00:05.505 --> 00:07.234
Uncle Phil's in the house.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.808
Give your little nephew Willie
from Philly a little huggy buggy.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.307
Get off me.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.381
Well, well, no more running out
of the house in the morning.

00:16.549 --> 00:18.176
No more trial.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.343
No more breakfast for the rest of us.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.446
I'm so glad the trial is over...

00:24.624 --> 00:28.060
...because now we can get
to all those things we've been putting off.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.196
- Ah.
Mm. Ha, ha.

00:30.363 --> 00:34.561
Sounds like somebody got
a little booty duty, huh, Uncle Phil?

00:35.568 --> 00:38.230
Sir, there's a Mr. Joe Winters to see you.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.168
Great. I didn't know he was coming by.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.104
Well, he's the head
of the Republicans for a Better Society.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.937
Republicans for a Better Society?

00:45.111 --> 00:47.705
You gotta get me a T-shirt.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.440
What's he here for?

00:50.617 --> 00:54.917
Well, they have this crazy idea
that I should become involved in politics.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.522
Oh, politics.
That's such a dirty corrupt business...

00:57.690 --> 00:59.590
...filled with nothing but self-interest.
- Yeah.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.455
Ooh. I've got goose bumps.

01:02.629 --> 01:05.096
I'm just gonna listen to him.
I don't wanna be rude.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.233
The mark of a true politician.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.265
Tell them what they wanna hear.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.996
Oh, honey,
don't forget our lunch reservation.

01:12.172 --> 01:15.801
Oh, well, sweetheart, maybe we should try
to make that another time, okay?

01:16.910 --> 01:21.142
Ah. Suck it up, Mom.
You're in politics now.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.015
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, hey. Good morning, Ash.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.914
What's good about it?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.782
What's good about it?

01:28.955 --> 01:33.449
Who did they just make assistant head
counter girl at Dippity Do Dog, huh?

01:33.626 --> 01:34.991
Oh, please. I hate my job.

01:35.161 --> 01:38.221
It's dirty. It's demeaning.
I have to work for a bunch of ingrates.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.525
You'll get used to it.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.212 --> 03:01.646
Thank you and come again.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.974
Excuse me.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.311
Excuse me.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.386
What kind of mineral water do you have?

03:09.455 --> 03:12.720
Uh, the only water we have
is in that fountain over there.

03:13.726 --> 03:16.456
Do I look like I drink
out of the public water supply?

03:17.964 --> 03:21.229
Why don't you be a dear and run out
and get me some Pellegrino?

03:21.401 --> 03:24.097
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I'm a little busy right now.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.205
Do you realize you're talking
to Jewel Pemberton?

03:27.373 --> 03:28.499
Ooh.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.041
The same Jewel Pemberton who's gonna
order something off the menu...

03:31.211 --> 03:32.701
...or get out of the line?

03:33.580 --> 03:37.448
I didn't build this country's top modeling
agency by putting up with such insolence.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.711
Young lady, you will never serve lunch
in this town again.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.980
- Is that a promise?
Wait.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.389
Turn your head that way again.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.221
- Excuse me?
- Just turn your head a little to the right.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.955
You are beautiful.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.390
Your hair. Oh!

03:55.568 --> 03:57.092
Your bone structure. Your figure.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.329
Has anyone ever talked to you
about modeling?

03:59.505 --> 04:02.941
Just this old guy that comes in here
with a Polaroid.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.504
How would you like to come work
for Pemberton?

04:08.314 --> 04:09.804
Uh...

04:09.983 --> 04:13.111
What kind of water
did you say you wanted?

04:14.187 --> 04:18.647
Ah. Cauliflower, your favorite.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.793
Geoffrey, what do you know about wine?

04:26.966 --> 04:29.366
I know no one does it better than you,
Miss Hilary.

04:31.170 --> 04:35.300
I'm going out with a wine connoisseur
tonight and I really want to impress him.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.909
Wear something low-cut.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.068
Well, duh.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.981
Where's Mom? I can't believe it. This is the
most incredible thing that's ever happened.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.420
I'm so excited.

04:49.589 --> 04:52.752
You know, this is like amazingly,
stupendously fantastic.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.416
- You heard?
- Heard about what?

04:55.995 --> 04:58.429
I got discovered today.
I'm gonna be a model.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.624
It's not that old guy with the Polaroid,
is it?

05:01.801 --> 05:03.860
What's going on in here?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.902
You'll never guess what happened to me.

05:06.072 --> 05:09.530
Pemberton Modeling Agency wants me
to sign with them. This is the contract.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.904
Sign it. Please, please, please.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.046
You realize that modeling is a field...

05:14.213 --> 05:16.681
...in which they judge you solely
on your looks?

05:16.849 --> 05:19.716
God, you are so lucky. Ha-ha-ha!

05:20.086 --> 05:23.214
This is a big deal. I'm gonna
have to discuss this with your father.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.186
Mom, it won't interfere with school.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.792
It's an opportunity
for me to learn a new career.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.656
One that doesn't make my hair smell
like fried meat.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.765
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Pemberton Modeling?

05:33.933 --> 05:36.401
I think they handle Naomi Campbell.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.436
I'd love to handle Naomi Campbell.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.736
Hey, come on, Aunt Viv.
Sign that doggone thing.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.740
Ashley, modeling is a waste of time.

05:44.911 --> 05:48.847
Sure, you'll travel the world, wear beautiful
clothes and make millions of dollars...

05:49.015 --> 05:51.006
...but that's it.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.618
Oh, Daddy, Pemberton Modeling Agency
wants me to sign with them.

05:56.789 --> 06:00.987
Come on, Uncle Phil. This is Ashley's big
chance for me to meet Naomi Campbell.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.822
- They're talking about putting me in a show.
- A big show.

06:03.996 --> 06:07.989
After which all the models are gonna wanna
come home with Ashley and have coffee.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.101
Geoffrey, start making
some damn coffee.

06:10.269 --> 06:14.000
Sweetheart, I just don't have time right
now. I've gotta meet with Joe Winters.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.267
Joe Winters? Now you know
how I feel about you going into politics.

06:17.443 --> 06:20.003
Of course I do, sweetheart.
I'm just being polite.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.476
But what about the contract?

06:21.647 --> 06:24.115
Have your mother look at it.
I won't be too late.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.576
Mom?

06:28.254 --> 06:29.778
Fine, honey.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.355
- Yes, yes, yes.
Okay.

06:31.524 --> 06:34.652
Hey. Hey, Ashley, you know the way
to get in good with the agency?

06:34.827 --> 06:38.126
You should throw, like, a little, you know,
model slumber party.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.624
Thanks, Will.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.461
You know what, forget it.
Forget the slumber party.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.036
Hey. Just invite them all over
and we all just get butt-naked right here.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.971
Look, I did not know
they were gonna keep me so late.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.482
But I'm gonna make it up to you.
I bought us tickets for the ballet.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.847
But, Philip, you hate the ballet.

07:02.021 --> 07:04.046
Worse than holding your purse, Vivian.

07:06.058 --> 07:07.787
That's how sorry I am.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.019
No. No. No.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.586
Now that is all wrong, Ashley.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.986
Now, look.
You gotta suck those cheeks in.

07:40.660 --> 07:44.061
And then you gotta look like you got
a real attitude problem, you know?

07:44.230 --> 07:47.222
- Uh, Will...
- Oh, that is perfect.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.835
Wait a second, there. Do you realize
they're taking 20-percent commission here?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.403
- What?
- So?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.803
Well, 20 percent is a lot of money.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.465
I'll handle this.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.338
No, I'll handle it.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.112
Nope. I'll handle it, Tattoo.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.310
- Get out of here. What, what, what?
- Give me.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.477
Up, Queenie. Up, Queenie.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.645
Boss, the plane. The plane.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.791
Will, give me that.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.690
You know, he'll stop that
once you get him fixed.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.000
Guys, stop it. Now, I don't want
either of you getting involved.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.331
I'm intelligent and competent
and I can handle my own affairs.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.396
Oh, all right.
Well, you're right, Ashley.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.804
You know, this is your deal,
you handle it.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.774
I wouldn't dream of interfering.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.650
We'll go take care of this
first thing in the morning.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.736
The pond is stocked
and I got the worm on my line.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.895
You know what I'm saying? Whoo!

09:01.674 --> 09:04.472
Come to papa, girl. Get over here.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.839
I'm going on record
as still being against this.

09:07.013 --> 09:10.972
Models are vacant and self-centered
and not the type we Banks associate with.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.122
I'll pay you $20 apiece
for your phone numbers.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.891
Miss Pemberton will see you now.

09:21.127 --> 09:24.494
Thirty. And when I call,
you don't even have to say anything.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.360
Huh? Huh? Fifty.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.567
Look, the show is tomorrow night
and we need a makeup man.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.901
I'm sorry, but going to the funeral
is not gonna bring your mother back, is it?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.043
Be there.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.144
Ha, ha. Miss Pemberton.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.077
Don't say another word.
Turn your head to the right.

09:46.852 --> 09:49.116
- Should I cough or something?
Shh!

09:49.622 --> 09:53.581
Strong features. Oh.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.920
Good frame.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.585
Yes. Oh.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.357
Yes. Oh, and I love the ears.
Don't change them.

10:00.533 --> 10:05.835
Handsome, but real. Like you were
West Philadelphia born and raised.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.870
You're hired.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.768
I'm not sure about you.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.903
But you might be right
for the husky pre-teen division.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.016
Huh?

10:18.184 --> 10:22.245
That's pretty funny, Jewel. But, no,
we're actually here to discuss Ashley Banks.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.321
Look, we've both been
around the block...

10:24.490 --> 10:27.789
...and the bottom line is,
this contract is no can do.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.757
Oh, it's a standard contract.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.830
Well, that's very true,
but Ashley is not your standard model.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.127
I mean, she has a real shot
at being the next Naomi Campbell.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.603
Uh, Naomi wouldn't be around
by any chance, would she?

10:41.340 --> 10:45.174
Let's cut to the chase, J.P.
Twenty percent is out of the question.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.404
You give our client a contract
we can live with or we walk.

10:48.581 --> 10:52.176
Oh, so it's the 20 percent that bothers you.
Well, then how does 10 percent sound?

10:52.351 --> 10:54.319
No, no, no. How about 5?

10:55.488 --> 11:00.016
You know what, now that I think about it,
why should we get anything at all?

11:00.192 --> 11:01.557
Boom-bi-ya.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.787
Sound like we all on the same page here.
Hey, so when she start modeling?

11:04.964 --> 11:09.401
When she finds another agent.
Tell your client she's fired.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.168
We could live with 10.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.275
One, two, three.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.280
<i>Hey, Ashley</i>

11:29.055 --> 11:31.023
<i>Will and Carlton are sorry</i>

11:33.959 --> 11:36.621
<i>Hey, kitty cat, hey, kitty cat
Hey, kitty cat</i>

11:36.796 --> 11:38.354
<i>Help, help me out</i>

11:42.635 --> 11:44.626
<i>We care about you very much</i>

11:44.804 --> 11:49.434
<i>Plea... Plea... Plea... Please forgive us</i>

11:49.942 --> 11:52.001
Will, stop it.

11:53.479 --> 11:54.673
Will!

11:59.151 --> 12:03.315
Please. I'm going to work now. Not to the
glamorous career I've always dreamed of.

12:03.489 --> 12:07.653
No, thanks to you, I'll be working
at Dippity Do Dog until I'm dippity dead.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.930
I think it worked.

12:14.433 --> 12:18.233
I think she's feeling much better.

12:19.405 --> 12:23.307
I think you've been smoking
a little bit too much of that cat nip.

12:24.343 --> 12:27.642
Hey, you take that back.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.412
Carlton, it's over.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.874
It's not over.

12:34.053 --> 12:37.216
What does he mean it's over?
It can't be over.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.972
Philip, it's Valentine's Day.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.630
Valentine's Day?

12:55.808 --> 12:58.299
I knew that. And we'll still be together.

12:58.477 --> 12:59.501
What about the ballet?

12:59.678 --> 13:02.806
I didn't know it was gonna conflict
with the Republican fundraiser.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.847
This isn't something
that we should miss.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.349
But a night alone with your wife is.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.883
Vivian, you're being unfair. I didn't know
about this until a little while ago.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.287
Unfair? I'll tell you what's unfair.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.054
For the past few months,
we've had no time together.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.493
We finally get some time together
and you cancel.

13:19.665 --> 13:20.757
I know. I know, sweetheart.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.428
- Things are a little hectic right now.
- Things are always hectic, Philip.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.970
But you always seem
to find time for your career.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.371
Sir, there's a Mr. Joe Winters on the phone.
He says it urgent.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.977
This is urgent.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.943
I know, sweetheart,
and I'll be right back.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.744
Thank you, Geoffrey. Geoffrey,
would lay my clothes out for this evening...

13:40.152 --> 13:43.315
...and get some flowers and candy here
ASAP.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.392
That man is on thin ice.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.129
I'll alert the fish.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.456
Regina.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.829
Regina!

13:58.003 --> 14:01.530
Regina, we have a show in four hours
and nothing is ready.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.800
Is everyone out
to make my life a living hell?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.534
You there, you're fired.

14:05.711 --> 14:08.145
Oh, that helped.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.539
Hey. How you doing?

14:11.717 --> 14:13.014
We're back. Ha, ha.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.847
Ah. It's Management "R" Us.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.989
Whose career are you ruining today?

14:18.157 --> 14:20.557
Ha! That was funny.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.957
No, but... No, actually, we're here
to talk to you about Ashley Banks.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.461
We were hoping
you would consider re-signing her.

14:26.632 --> 14:27.792
And why would I do that?

14:27.967 --> 14:30.629
I'm telling you,
Ashley is on her way to the top.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.567
I mean, she could be
the next Naomi Campbell.

14:33.739 --> 14:36.867
Uh, speaking of which,
Naomi wouldn't be around, would she?

14:37.343 --> 14:38.867
Look, you've gotta take her back.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.241
She's my sister
and she's really, really mad at me.

14:42.915 --> 14:46.112
Okay, look, I'm a reasonable person.

14:46.285 --> 14:50.881
I'll take Ashley back for you,
but you have got to do something for me.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.121
I'm gonna fade into the background...

14:55.294 --> 14:57.762
...if you don't get
some highlighter on my cheekbones.

14:57.930 --> 14:58.954
Use number seven.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.691
- And, blend, man, blend.
Sorry.

15:01.867 --> 15:02.891
Excuse me.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.468
You guys look...

15:06.205 --> 15:08.173
...great.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.964
Hey. Oh, so, what do we do?

15:10.142 --> 15:12.667
We just, you know,
go out there and walk around?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.312
Just walk around?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.947
Did Voltaire just write?

15:16.115 --> 15:17.480
Did Klimt just paint?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.015
Did Heidegger just think?

15:22.688 --> 15:25.680
I guess we just go out there
and walk around.

15:28.861 --> 15:33.525
Ah, Vivian, in the short time I've known
your husband, I can say he's a fine man.

15:33.699 --> 15:37.260
You would know. You've probably spent
a lot more time with him than I have lately.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.405
Ah, ha, ha.
Hasn't she got a great sense of humor?

15:41.907 --> 15:43.568
You two make a great couple.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.302
- I'm just glad you're Republicans.
Ha, ha.

15:46.712 --> 15:50.739
Well, Joe, Vivian and I
are both thrilled to be here.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.907
Aren't we, sweetie?

16:02.294 --> 16:05.161
Okay, guys. Your outfits are on the rack
right here, okay?

16:05.331 --> 16:06.525
Great.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.257
Where are the dressing rooms?

16:08.434 --> 16:09.458
You're in them.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.659
No, no, Margy.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.498
Wrong outfit. You're in the purple.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.800
Uh, Will, l...

16:16.976 --> 16:19.240
I have a little problem with this.

16:19.411 --> 16:23.108
You see,
I'm a bit uncomfortable with nudity.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.516
Oh, don't worry, Carlton.
We're all uncomfortable with your nudity.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.555
It's like Colin Powell said:

16:33.726 --> 16:36.695
"Family values is the foundation
of the American way of life."

16:36.862 --> 16:39.422
Ah. I couldn't agree with you more, Joe.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.226
The real tragedy in America today
is that our youth...

16:42.401 --> 16:45.268
...aren't being given
any sense of direction by their parents.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.429
- There's just no communication.
- And what do you think, Vivian?

16:48.607 --> 16:52.941
Oh, I don't have to think. Philip has decided
to do all of the thinking for both of us.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.581
Okay, people. Showtime.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.885
You guys are gonna do great. Now,
remember. It's walk, walk, turn, walk.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.579
- Flip, rotate, walk, turn.
- Right.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.249
And remember, no smiling.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.361
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait. Will?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.659
Um, it's flip, turn, walk, rotate?

17:15.834 --> 17:16.993
No, no, no.

17:17.169 --> 17:20.468
It's flip, rotate, turn, walk.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.867
You know,
everything that you've been saying...

17:24.042 --> 17:26.136
...resonates with the people
in our community.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.871
That's why we're so thrilled
that you've decided to run.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.112
What?

17:40.159 --> 17:42.753
Now there's some kids
with no family values, huh, Phil?

17:42.928 --> 17:44.691
I couldn't agree with you more.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.561
Oh, my God.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.656
Do you have any idea what
you could've cost me this evening, huh?

18:56.835 --> 19:00.965
Did you even consider my feelings before
you went prancing out there on that stage?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.732
- Philip.
- Wait, Vivian.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.376
Do you have any sense
of the embarrassment I suffered?

19:05.544 --> 19:07.478
- No.
- But we were all wearing the same...

19:07.646 --> 19:09.204
Nobody embarrassed you, Philip.

19:09.381 --> 19:13.818
And the only one who's not considering
other people's feelings in this house is you.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.879
Coming, Geoffrey.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.115
- Stay where you are.
- Leave.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.089
I said, stay.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.387
Leave us alone.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.962
- Go, go, go.
- Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.928
How dare you stick up for those kids
after what they put us through.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.334
Speak for yourself, Philip.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.703
The only one
who is putting me through anything is you.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.434
What is that supposed to mean?

19:39.878 --> 19:43.780
It means how dare you agree
to go into politics without consulting me...

19:43.949 --> 19:47.077
...knowing the way I feel about it.
- I was gonna tell you about it.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.117
When? When we move
into the Governor's Mansion?

19:49.288 --> 19:52.416
Oh, now we're getting a little ahead
of ourselves, aren't we? But...

19:52.591 --> 19:55.253
Philip, this is not a joke.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.327
I want my husband back.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.988
For the past few months,
you have been promising this entire family...

20:01.166 --> 20:04.101
...more time, more attention, more you.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.794
Vivian, this is a great opportunity.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.803
- For whom?
- For all of us.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.135
Nope. Wrong. For you.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.777
Vivian, you've lost perspective.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.573
Now, if you think about this,
you'll see how great it is.

20:15.747 --> 20:20.741
The only thing I see is that somewhere
along the way, us became you.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.910
And frankly,
I'm not gonna take it anymore.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.715
And what is that supposed to mean?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.381
It means I'm going
to my sister's house...

20:27.559 --> 20:29.925
...until you figure out
what's important to you.

20:30.095 --> 20:32.996
- What?
- Goodbye.
