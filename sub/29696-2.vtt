17:30.047 --> 17:31.964
-I'm opening it, Angela.
-You gotta wait.

17:32.047 --> 17:33.422
-I don't wanna wait.
-You gotta wait.

17:33.506 --> 17:35.255
(thud upstairs)

17:36.631 --> 17:38.506
-Oh, that must be Santa Claus.
-Shh!

17:40.005 --> 17:41.255
What?

17:42.130 --> 17:44.339
(whispers):
There's somebody in our house.

17:44.422 --> 17:46.506
(ticking)

17:47.130 --> 17:49.422
-(clock chimes)
-(door clatters)

17:49.506 --> 17:50.631
(shotgun blasts)

17:53.798 --> 17:56.798
(shotgun blasting)

18:00.339 --> 18:04.047
(slowed, distorted):
♪ To a platinum mine ♪

18:04.130 --> 18:11.506
♪ Santa baby, so hurry
down the chimney tonight ♪

18:15.798 --> 18:17.547
-(Angela grunts)
-(man groans)

18:19.839 --> 18:22.130
-(gunshot)
-(Angela grunts)

18:22.214 --> 18:24.339
(clock chiming)

18:28.214 --> 18:31.214
(Angela gasping, gagging)

18:41.964 --> 18:43.297
Cal...

18:47.714 --> 18:49.798
(Angela gasps, groans)

18:49.881 --> 18:53.714
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

18:54.923 --> 18:56.339
You're okay.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.089
(groaning)

18:59.172 --> 19:01.506
Cal... Cal!

19:01.589 --> 19:04.506
He's all right.
He's safe.

19:04.589 --> 19:06.130
Where is he?

19:06.214 --> 19:08.422
He was sitting
right here in this chair

19:08.506 --> 19:10.714
for the last
three days straight.

19:11.839 --> 19:13.839
I told him to go home and...

19:14.964 --> 19:16.631
change his clothes.

19:16.714 --> 19:18.839
Promised I'd keep an eye on you.

19:19.881 --> 19:22.005
Thanks, Captain.

19:23.089 --> 19:24.422
Judd.

19:26.923 --> 19:28.923
They came for you too?

19:32.923 --> 19:34.756
They came for everybody.

19:35.756 --> 19:37.714
Coordinated attack.

19:38.464 --> 19:43.089
Simultaneous hits.
Forty houses, all police.

19:44.339 --> 19:48.422
Most of us asleep in our beds
on Christmas Eve.

19:50.130 --> 19:54.881
The news is calling it
the White Night.

19:57.923 --> 19:59.589
But I was home.

19:59.673 --> 20:03.005
Fucker in a Rorschach came
through my window and shot me,

20:03.089 --> 20:05.589
so I blew
his fucking face off.

20:07.255 --> 20:09.506
You got your guy too, huh.

20:09.589 --> 20:12.255
Stabbed him, and he bled out
in your kitchen.

20:13.506 --> 20:17.089
I reckon there's somebody
up there lookin' out for you.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.964
Doyle?

20:25.506 --> 20:28.005
He and Ginny were
at home in bed,

20:28.089 --> 20:29.923
and that's where
we found them.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.714
Their boy, Christopher,
heard the gunshots

20:34.798 --> 20:37.631
and took his sister and the baby
and hid in the closet.

20:39.047 --> 20:40.631
Topher.

20:42.297 --> 20:45.130
He goes by Topher.

20:48.005 --> 20:49.255
Yeah.

20:50.214 --> 20:53.339
Fuck that.
Everybody who's left...

20:53.422 --> 20:55.631
we round
those racist fuckers up--

20:55.714 --> 20:57.631
There's nobody left.

20:59.964 --> 21:04.297
The entire force knows
that the Kavalry has
our names and addresses.

21:04.381 --> 21:07.714
-They're all resigning.
-I'm not fucking quitting.

21:09.756 --> 21:13.339
Well, I guess
I won't quit either.

21:25.339 --> 21:29.506
I just told you
that your partner
and his wife got killed.

21:31.005 --> 21:34.297
-You can cry, Detective Abar.
-Angela.

21:34.839 --> 21:36.339
Angela.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.547
It's okay to cry.

21:44.381 --> 21:46.005
Maybe later.

21:52.297 --> 21:53.839
I'm sorry.

21:57.047 --> 21:58.923
I let you down.

22:05.881 --> 22:07.923
Crawford's Voice:
I let you down.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.214
(zipping)

22:31.756 --> 22:32.714
Looking Glass:
Now what?

22:32.798 --> 22:34.589
Red Scare:
We roll into Nixonville,

22:34.673 --> 22:37.923
bust Kavalry heads
until someone talks.

22:38.005 --> 22:39.714
That is fucking now what!

22:39.798 --> 22:42.089
-Mount up, cowboys!
-Night: Wait!

22:42.756 --> 22:46.673
We should... just stop
and take a breath.

22:47.339 --> 22:49.923
You don't want to beat
shit out of these fucks?

22:50.005 --> 22:51.089
You?

22:51.172 --> 22:53.381
She loves beating the shit
out of these fucks.

22:53.964 --> 22:56.255
Looking Glass:
That much is indisputable.

22:56.714 --> 22:59.589
So, are you coming
or are you fucking breathing?

23:00.798 --> 23:02.130
I'm coming.

23:03.422 --> 23:06.923
Red Scare:
Giddy-fucking-up!
Let's ride!

23:20.381 --> 23:21.631
(feedback whines)

23:21.714 --> 23:25.214
All right, listen up,
you racist fucks.

23:25.297 --> 23:27.631
Our chief has been murdered.

23:28.297 --> 23:30.589
Murdered by one of you.

23:30.673 --> 23:33.673
Some of you are in the Kavalry,
others are not.

23:33.756 --> 23:36.381
I don't fucking care
which is which.

23:36.464 --> 23:38.047
If you can hear my voice,

23:38.130 --> 23:40.547
you're going to walk out
of your shitty trailers

23:40.631 --> 23:43.172
and into one of these
lovely paddy wagons.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.798
-(dog barking)
-But if a single one of you

23:45.881 --> 23:49.214
decides not to accept
our invitation...

23:50.339 --> 23:53.839
we tear down your fucking idol!

23:55.506 --> 23:58.714
Ten, nine, eight...

23:58.798 --> 24:01.297
seven, six,

24:01.381 --> 24:03.339
-five, four...
-(spits)

24:03.422 --> 24:06.297
...three, two...

24:06.881 --> 24:08.506
(glass shatters)

24:11.005 --> 24:13.506
Come on, man.
We don't need to do this.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.422
Round them up!

24:16.506 --> 24:18.839
(indistinct shouting)

24:21.339 --> 24:22.881
(taser crackling)

24:33.673 --> 24:35.839
-(taser crackling)
-(dog barking)

24:39.255 --> 24:41.756
You ain't interested
in joining in?

24:42.714 --> 24:44.923
This shit is unnecessary.

24:45.464 --> 24:47.714
-Look out!
-(man grunts)

24:57.422 --> 25:00.589
(Night grunting)

25:08.631 --> 25:11.756
(dog barking)

25:18.047 --> 25:20.964
(panting)

25:26.547 --> 25:29.214
(breathing deeply)

25:49.255 --> 25:51.923
Woman:
Redfordations are abominations!

25:52.381 --> 25:54.964
Man:
You got a sorry,
now you want a handout?

25:55.381 --> 25:58.881
-Equal rights, equal taxes!
-Redfordations are
an abomination!

26:04.047 --> 26:07.839
Soldier:
We knew a war was comin',
so we put our uniforms on.

26:07.923 --> 26:10.756
Figured maybe
that'd protect us.

26:10.839 --> 26:13.422
How could they look
at a man who fought
under the same flag...

26:13.506 --> 26:15.422
Newswoman:
As they were dragging
my friend's body

26:15.506 --> 26:18.714
behind their cars,
I was taking notes.

26:18.798 --> 26:21.130
I needed to do something...
(continues indistinctly)

26:22.839 --> 26:24.005
(chimes)

26:24.089 --> 26:27.964
Hello. I'm United States
Treasury Secretary,

26:28.047 --> 26:29.714
Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

26:29.798 --> 26:32.214
If you like,
you can call me "Skip."

26:32.297 --> 26:33.714
What's your name?

26:35.130 --> 26:36.339
Will.

26:36.422 --> 26:40.381
Hello... Will.
What can I help you with today?

26:40.464 --> 26:42.714
I need to know who I am.

26:43.964 --> 26:46.005
I'm sorry, I can't
help you with that,

26:46.089 --> 26:47.756
but I can check
your eligibility.

26:47.839 --> 26:51.172
- Would you like me to do that?
-Yeah. Yes.

26:51.255 --> 26:52.881
Almost a century ago,

26:52.964 --> 26:55.297
on the very spot
on which you now stand,

26:55.381 --> 26:59.589
the vibrant and affluent
African-American community
of Greenwood

26:59.673 --> 27:02.756
was so prosperous that
later it became known

27:02.839 --> 27:05.422
as the Black Wall Street.

27:05.506 --> 27:08.714
And then, in the space
of a single day,

27:08.798 --> 27:10.214
it was all gone.

27:10.297 --> 27:13.756
The Tulsa Massacre resulted
in profound loss of life,

27:13.839 --> 27:17.381
not to mention
the property and treasure
pillaged from its victims.

27:17.464 --> 27:20.839
For far too long,
this horrific chapter
in our nation's history

27:20.923 --> 27:23.798
went untold
and unacknowledged.

27:23.881 --> 27:26.964
On behalf of the entire
United States government,

27:27.047 --> 27:30.923
President Redford offers
his sincerest condolences

27:31.005 --> 27:36.005
for the trauma
you or your family
may have suffered.

27:36.089 --> 27:39.339
May I have your consent to test
a sample of your DNA?

27:39.422 --> 27:41.381
Yes.

27:41.464 --> 27:44.381
Gates:
Please take a cotton swab
from the drawer,

27:44.464 --> 27:47.130
gently rub it on
the inside of your cheek,

27:47.214 --> 27:49.839
then place it in the slot.

27:49.923 --> 27:53.381
Your DNA will be processed
exclusively here

27:53.464 --> 27:56.005
at the Greenwood Center
for Cultural Heritage.

27:56.089 --> 27:59.798
Only survivors of
the 1921 Tulsa Massacre

27:59.881 --> 28:01.714
and their direct descendants

28:01.798 --> 28:04.714
are eligible to apply
at this facility.

28:04.798 --> 28:07.130
Please tell us the best
number to call you.

28:08.255 --> 28:12.881
539-176-2442.

28:12.964 --> 28:15.255
- Thank you.
-("Battle Hymn of
the Republic" playing)

28:15.339 --> 28:18.047
Our country appreciates
the opportunity

28:18.130 --> 28:20.673
to right the wrongs
of a dark past,

28:20.756 --> 28:23.964
so that we may all
share a bright future.

28:24.047 --> 28:25.381
God Bless America.

28:38.297 --> 28:40.255
You're not allowed to be here.

28:41.297 --> 28:44.047
And you're not allowed
to withhold my visitation.

28:44.130 --> 28:46.297
I know they're
inside there,

28:46.381 --> 28:48.589
even though that chickenshit
husband of yours

28:48.673 --> 28:50.214
ain't answerin' the door.

28:50.297 --> 28:54.214
Look, you gonna sort this out,
or am I calling the cops?

28:54.297 --> 28:55.506
The cops are busy
rounding up

28:55.589 --> 28:58.005
every suspected Kavalry
member in Nixonville.

28:58.089 --> 28:59.589
It's my day.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.589
Can you take a raincheck?

29:03.297 --> 29:05.631
I could take a real check.

29:12.881 --> 29:16.798
Must be satisfying-- putting
those Redfordations to work.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.047
Get the fuck off my porch.

29:19.130 --> 29:22.756
Rosie:
Argh! Keep walking,
you lily-livered stowaway!

29:22.839 --> 29:25.881
-Calvin: Ow!
-Rosie: Keep walking
or I'll stab you in the butt!

29:25.964 --> 29:27.714
-Calvin: Ow! Ow! Ow!
-Mommy!

29:27.798 --> 29:31.798
Hey! What's going on in here?

29:31.881 --> 29:33.506
She's a pirate.
I'm an owl.

29:33.589 --> 29:35.214
We caught a ghost
on our ship.

29:35.297 --> 29:37.089
-A ghost, huh?
-Calvin: Boo.

29:37.172 --> 29:40.130
He's walking the plank.
We're gonna feed him
to the sharks!

29:40.214 --> 29:42.631
Oh, well, then you need
to put something

29:42.714 --> 29:44.297
in his pockets
to weigh him down

29:44.381 --> 29:46.089
because when he gets
to the end,

29:46.172 --> 29:47.422
he's just gonna
float away.

29:47.506 --> 29:49.214
-Rocks!
-Rocks!

29:54.214 --> 29:55.964
He still out on the porch?

29:56.839 --> 29:58.631
I got rid of him.

30:04.714 --> 30:06.422
You arrested the old man?

30:06.506 --> 30:08.714
He's still at the bakery.

30:08.798 --> 30:10.756
And you didn't arrest him.

30:11.214 --> 30:13.214
I didn't arrest him
because he didn't do it.

30:13.297 --> 30:14.589
But he says he did.

30:14.673 --> 30:18.047
He also says that Dr. Manhattan
can pretend to be human.

30:19.714 --> 30:23.005
-No he can't.
And he's on Mars.
-Mm.

30:23.547 --> 30:25.172
That's what I said.

30:35.547 --> 30:37.422
Are we safe, Angela?

30:40.547 --> 30:42.714
I would tell you if we weren't.

30:42.798 --> 30:45.255
(kids giggling)

30:46.089 --> 30:49.422
-Is Topher in his room?
-Mm-hmm.

30:50.589 --> 30:52.631
You want me
to come with you?

30:52.714 --> 30:54.089
Uh-uh.

30:55.255 --> 30:57.255
You go walk the plank.

31:02.339 --> 31:06.089
I called Jane.
She's having people
over tonight.

31:06.589 --> 31:09.714
I'll stay here with the kids,
but you should go.

31:11.798 --> 31:15.381
-How is she?
-She sounded completely fine.

31:16.339 --> 31:18.214
Even though I know she's not.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.756
Just like you.

31:38.798 --> 31:40.756
-Angela: Hey!
-Hey.

31:41.297 --> 31:44.089
-Can we talk a minute?
-Okay.

31:57.047 --> 31:58.589
There are people
who believe

31:58.673 --> 32:01.589
that this world
is fair and good--

32:02.255 --> 32:04.798
that it's all
lollipops and rainbows.

32:06.297 --> 32:08.839
I remember what happened
to my parents.

32:09.923 --> 32:12.297
You remember what happened
to your parents.

32:13.506 --> 32:17.297
You and me, Topher, we don't
do lollipops and rainbows,

32:17.381 --> 32:18.923
because we know
those are pretty colors

32:19.005 --> 32:21.506
that just hide
what the world really is.

32:22.881 --> 32:24.464
Black and white.

32:30.464 --> 32:32.506
Your Uncle Judd is dead.

32:35.214 --> 32:37.506
Somebody hung him
from a tree.

32:40.547 --> 32:41.881
Okay.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.339
He was a policeman.

32:48.381 --> 32:49.923
Policemen die.

32:52.673 --> 32:54.839
He wasn't my real uncle anyway.

32:59.214 --> 33:02.547
Don't tell Rosie and Emma yet.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.339
I'll handle it tomorrow.

33:07.381 --> 33:08.714
All right.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.089
(clattering)

33:16.589 --> 33:18.756
Can I watch TV?

33:20.756 --> 33:24.214
Yes, baby.
You can watch TV.

33:50.089 --> 33:53.381
Announcer (on TV):

34:35.255 --> 34:37.005
Be advised.

34:44.798 --> 34:46.297
Man:
I'm dead.

34:46.964 --> 34:48.464
Shot in the head.

34:50.923 --> 34:54.422
Washed up in Boston Harbor.

34:54.506 --> 34:58.047
That's the last photo that
will ever be taken of me.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.756
Rolf Muller.
Circus Strongman.

35:01.839 --> 35:04.005
Except that's not me.

35:04.089 --> 35:07.172
I just need people to think
it is so they'll stop looking.

35:09.214 --> 35:12.464
I'm not ready to tell you
who I really am.

35:12.547 --> 35:16.214
If I did, you wouldn't
watch until the end.

35:16.297 --> 35:18.172
So, let's start
at the beginning.

35:18.255 --> 35:19.589
Extry, extry!

35:19.673 --> 35:23.130
War of the Worlds broadcast
throws Manhattan into panic!

35:23.214 --> 35:25.547
Alien invasion just a--

35:25.631 --> 35:27.464
Hoax! Read all about it!

35:27.547 --> 35:29.089
(horn beeps)

35:41.047 --> 35:44.005
This is a stick up!
Everyone on the ground, now!

35:44.089 --> 35:46.756
-Wallets and watches!
-(gunshots)

35:47.547 --> 35:48.923
(woman shrieks)

35:49.005 --> 35:50.422
Open that safe, now!

35:50.506 --> 35:52.130
We don't--
we don't have a safe.

35:52.214 --> 35:54.881
-(gunshot)
-(glass shatters)

35:55.714 --> 35:57.047
Grab one of the dames!

35:57.130 --> 35:59.130
-On your feet!
-(woman screams)

35:59.214 --> 36:01.964
Now, you open that safe,
or we blow her brains out

36:02.047 --> 36:03.589
all over your Lux Laundry Soap!

36:03.673 --> 36:07.381
-You got three seconds.
-Please, there's no safe,
I swear!

36:07.464 --> 36:10.923
-Three... two...
-(woman whimpers)

36:11.005 --> 36:13.130
(glass shattering)

36:25.714 --> 36:27.089
(grunts)

36:31.923 --> 36:33.464
(screams)

36:34.923 --> 36:36.547
(screams)

36:36.631 --> 36:38.047
(cocks pistol)

36:39.005 --> 36:41.923
(gunshots)

36:58.881 --> 37:00.923
(gasping)

37:03.214 --> 37:05.089
(whimpers)

37:08.297 --> 37:10.130
(whimpers):
Who are you?

37:13.089 --> 37:15.714
Hooded Justice:
Who am I?

37:15.798 --> 37:18.422
When I was little,
every time I looked
in the mirror,

37:18.506 --> 37:21.673
I saw a stranger
staring back at me.

37:22.339 --> 37:24.756
He was very, very angry.

37:24.839 --> 37:26.381
(thunder rumbles)

37:26.464 --> 37:28.673
What could I do
with all this anger--

37:28.756 --> 37:33.547
hot, vibrating electricity
with no place to ground it?

37:33.631 --> 37:36.130
If he couldn't
release his rage...

37:36.214 --> 37:39.297
maybe I could help him hide it.

37:39.381 --> 37:42.255
I never felt comfortable
in my own skin,

37:42.339 --> 37:44.756
so I made a new one.

37:44.839 --> 37:49.964
And when I slipped it on,
he and I became one.

37:50.047 --> 37:51.964
His anger became mine,

37:52.047 --> 37:54.631
as did his thirst for justice.

37:56.589 --> 37:58.839
So, who am I?

38:01.339 --> 38:04.381
If I knew the answer to that...

38:04.464 --> 38:06.589
I wouldn't be wearing
a fucking mask.

38:06.673 --> 38:09.464
(piano playing softly)

38:09.547 --> 38:12.297
(voices murmuring)

38:29.631 --> 38:31.714
Jane, I'm so sorry.

38:33.214 --> 38:34.756
Thank you for coming.

38:35.297 --> 38:36.631
I'm sorry, I should've called.

38:36.714 --> 38:40.255
I didn't know all these people
were gonna be here.

38:41.214 --> 38:44.547
You must be Angela.
Joe Keene.

38:45.339 --> 38:46.589
Senator.

38:47.130 --> 38:48.381
Just Joe.

38:49.047 --> 38:51.964
Jane here has to call me Senator
because she works for me.

38:52.047 --> 38:54.047
Used to work for you.

38:55.047 --> 38:59.881
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Judd was a great man.

38:59.964 --> 39:01.547
Yeah. Thank you.

39:01.631 --> 39:05.506
I just want you to know
whatever resources y'all need

39:05.589 --> 39:08.756
to get the animals
who did this, they're yours.

39:09.798 --> 39:13.297
Oh, I'm not a cop anymore.

39:13.381 --> 39:14.881
I retired.

39:16.089 --> 39:19.589
Right. Of course.
I'm sorry.

39:21.756 --> 39:25.255
Can I take those flowers?
Jane, do you have a vase?

39:25.339 --> 39:27.422
Honey, are you okay?

39:27.506 --> 39:29.881
-Whoa, whoa.
-Jesus!

39:31.631 --> 39:36.714
I'm so sorry.
I came over here
to take care of you.

39:37.381 --> 39:39.547
Jane:
Now I get to take care of you.

39:40.422 --> 39:43.297
You should be
with your friends.

39:44.422 --> 39:46.631
You are my friend too.

39:50.005 --> 39:51.756
And so was he.

39:53.631 --> 39:55.172
(whispering):
He loved you.

39:56.339 --> 39:57.798
He really did.

40:02.339 --> 40:05.631
You get those fuckers
that did this to him.

40:06.297 --> 40:07.923
Okay?

40:11.714 --> 40:14.839
And you take
as much time as you need.

40:20.464 --> 40:22.130
(sighs)

42:18.047 --> 42:22.798
(hooves clomping)

42:30.714 --> 42:32.839
(horse whinnies)

42:33.881 --> 42:37.464
-Whoa up, Bucephalus.

42:59.964 --> 43:05.214
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow ♪

43:05.297 --> 43:06.839
Please, let's get on with it.

43:06.923 --> 43:09.464
(faster):
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow,

43:09.547 --> 43:10.964
(blows)

43:12.172 --> 43:16.839
Ms. Crookshanks,
when is a lie not a lie?

43:16.923 --> 43:19.172
When it's acting, Master.

43:20.005 --> 43:21.631
Real tears tonight, yeah?

43:21.714 --> 43:23.339
Every drop, sir.

43:28.297 --> 43:29.589
Philips:
Oh! Sir?

43:29.673 --> 43:32.714
Forgive me, I shall require
the watch I gifted you.

43:32.798 --> 43:34.964
-As a prop.
-Oh.

43:36.381 --> 43:39.005
Has it ever occurred
to you, Mr. Philips...

43:40.673 --> 43:42.839
you are the prop?

43:43.673 --> 43:45.089
Would you like it
to occur to me, sir?

43:45.172 --> 43:48.172
There are so many things
I'd like to occur to you.

43:49.381 --> 43:52.214
All right, dimwits--
on with the show!

43:52.839 --> 43:55.714
(violin playing romantic melody)

44:06.839 --> 44:10.339
Crookshanks:
These have been the happiest
six months of my life, Jon.

44:10.422 --> 44:12.631
Philips:
And mine, Janey.

44:12.714 --> 44:15.547
Time for another beer
before we go?

44:17.130 --> 44:18.589
Crookshanks:
Confound it!

44:19.381 --> 44:22.589
I don't have my watch.
Have you fixed it yet?

44:22.673 --> 44:24.881
Philips:
I did, indeed!

44:25.881 --> 44:28.631
Damn! I must have
left it in the--

44:28.714 --> 44:32.005
must have left it in
the intrinsic field generator!"

44:32.089 --> 44:33.381
I'll go fetch it.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.130
Eureka! There it is!

44:44.798 --> 44:46.673
-Oh my!
-(grunts)

44:46.756 --> 44:48.923
I appear to be locked in.

44:49.464 --> 44:51.047
(drum beating)

44:51.130 --> 44:52.381
Janey!

44:53.214 --> 44:54.923
If you could just
open the door.

44:55.005 --> 44:58.172
I can't!
The lock, it's...

44:58.714 --> 45:02.005
(sighs)
As impenetrable as
the Gordian Knot itself!

45:02.089 --> 45:07.130
Oh. It's as impenetrable
as the Gordian Knot itself!

45:07.214 --> 45:08.631
Oh, Jon.

45:08.714 --> 45:11.839
I can't bear to see your
body being torn asunder

45:11.923 --> 45:13.756
by the quantum fates!

45:15.547 --> 45:17.339
I love you, Jon Osterman!

45:17.422 --> 45:18.881
And I love you, Janey Slater!

45:18.964 --> 45:21.339
Masked Musician:
Three, two, one...

45:24.464 --> 45:28.714
(Mr. Philips screaming)

45:28.798 --> 45:30.756
(screaming):
Master!

45:31.255 --> 45:34.714
The tears, Crookshanks--
Let's see those damn tears!

45:34.798 --> 45:37.339
(Mr. Philips screaming)

45:38.297 --> 45:39.506
Oh, Jon.

45:41.381 --> 45:43.589
My dear beloved Jon.

45:45.297 --> 45:48.130
(violin playing bright melody)

45:52.756 --> 45:54.631
My God! Jon?

45:55.923 --> 45:57.506
Is that you?

45:57.589 --> 46:02.339
I am both Jon and not Jon.

46:02.422 --> 46:07.047
I am the past, the present,
and the future all at once.

46:07.130 --> 46:09.422
Boundless omniscience
incarnate,

46:09.506 --> 46:14.339
swirling in the luminous
plasma of a newborn star!

46:20.589 --> 46:21.798
I am...

46:23.881 --> 46:26.214
Dr. Manhattan!

46:26.964 --> 46:30.839
Oh, Jon...
is this the end?

46:30.923 --> 46:32.964
Nothing ends, Janey.

46:33.381 --> 46:36.798
Both:
Nothing ever ends.

46:38.464 --> 46:40.297
(light clacks off)

46:44.964 --> 46:46.547
Fantastic!

46:47.714 --> 46:49.047
Bravo!

46:49.964 --> 46:52.422
Bravo!
(applauding)

46:53.255 --> 46:55.381
It was all your
magnificent words, Master.

46:55.464 --> 47:00.631
Poppycock! It was us.
It was all of us,
working together.

47:00.714 --> 47:02.047
Transcendent!

47:03.464 --> 47:06.214
-We're thrilled
you enjoyed it, Master!
-Mm.

47:07.297 --> 47:10.047
Ladies, gentlemen...

47:10.881 --> 47:12.339
Fantastic.

47:16.255 --> 47:17.547
Job well done.

47:17.631 --> 47:22.214
Now, if you would kindly
remove Mr. Philips's corpse.

47:24.422 --> 47:27.631
Shall we put him in the cellar
with the others, sir?

47:28.339 --> 47:31.339
I'm sorry.
Your name is...?

47:32.089 --> 47:36.506
-Montrose, sir.
-Montrose. How would you like
to be the new Mr. Philips?

47:36.589 --> 47:38.547
I'd be honored, Master.

47:38.631 --> 47:41.923
Mr. Philips, the basement
will be perfect.

47:44.589 --> 47:47.589
We'll have use for him
before too long.

47:49.673 --> 47:51.130
Oh. Oh, no, wait.

47:52.589 --> 47:54.089
(body thuds)

47:54.172 --> 47:57.089
(sighs, groans)

47:58.798 --> 48:00.297
(bones crack)

48:16.422 --> 48:18.005
Has it stopped, Master?

48:19.422 --> 48:21.130
No, Ms. Crookshanks.

48:22.130 --> 48:24.130
It's only just begun.

48:25.964 --> 48:30.464
(ticking)

48:53.172 --> 48:54.798
What the fuck
are you doing?

48:54.881 --> 48:58.005
Cooking some eggs.
You like 'em hard-boiled?

49:00.422 --> 49:02.047
Where'd you get eggs from?

49:02.130 --> 49:05.172
Grocery, across the street.

49:06.089 --> 49:08.839
You left and then you came back?

49:10.214 --> 49:11.881
We hadn't done talking yet.

49:11.964 --> 49:14.130
Well, I did what you wanted.

49:14.214 --> 49:16.589
Oh. What'd I want?

49:16.673 --> 49:18.881
Skeletons in the closet?

49:19.798 --> 49:21.172
I'm not following you.

49:21.255 --> 49:23.839
You said Crawford had
skeletons in his closet,

49:23.923 --> 49:26.714
so I went and I looked
in his fucking closet.

49:26.798 --> 49:29.047
Oh. I didn't mean literally.

49:34.381 --> 49:35.631
What's this?

49:35.714 --> 49:38.673
Did you put it there?
Are you trying to set him up?

49:38.756 --> 49:41.381
Because that was really
fucking easy to find.

49:43.547 --> 49:47.339
-Was it in his closet?
-Yes.

49:47.798 --> 49:50.631
What floor was it on?
You know, I can't go up stairs.

49:50.714 --> 49:52.923
Yet you hung
a man from a tree.

49:53.005 --> 49:54.923
Oh, yeah.
That's true.

49:55.005 --> 49:59.422
You trying to make me think that
he's one of them? The Kavalry?

49:59.506 --> 50:00.756
Well, there's plenty
of good reasons

50:00.839 --> 50:03.214
for a man to hide
a Klan robe in a closet,

50:03.297 --> 50:05.005
but I just
can't think of any.

50:05.089 --> 50:08.214
You better tell me what
the fuck is going on here
or I'm taking you in.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.923
If you wanted to take me in,
you would've done it by now.

50:11.589 --> 50:15.172
If it's any consolation,
I would've been rescued anyway.

50:15.255 --> 50:17.297
Rescued by fucking who?

50:17.964 --> 50:20.172
I've got friends
in high places.

50:20.255 --> 50:21.756
(timer rings)

50:22.673 --> 50:24.923
(phone ringing)

50:28.839 --> 50:30.964
(ringing continuing)

50:33.089 --> 50:34.297

51:31.172 --> 51:33.047
didn't tell you
anything about me?

51:35.130 --> 51:36.381
Nothing.

51:37.506 --> 51:39.255
Hmm.

51:39.339 --> 51:42.464
Now, what do you
want to know?

51:45.172 --> 51:47.214
