00:41.291 --> 00:45.041
Uh, hey, I thought you had
a-a-a televised sermon tonight.

00:45.041 --> 00:46.583
Yeah, I did.

00:46.583 --> 00:51.625
It was all about Jesus
and his duel with the devil in the desert,

00:51.625 --> 00:53.916
which Jesus won!

00:53.916 --> 00:55.208
Thanks to karate.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.625
Wait, really?

00:56.625 --> 01:00.333
But little did I know
that I would come home

01:00.333 --> 01:05.625
to find Satan's very own music
playing in my house!

01:05.625 --> 01:08.083
It... I swear it won't happen again!

01:08.083 --> 01:11.625
 Boy, I can guarantee that.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.375
Now, you see? What'd I tell you?

02:06.375 --> 02:08.333
This is kind of nice.

02:08.333 --> 02:11.291
I promised you more time for us,
and that starts right now.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.916
Feels like I've heard that before.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.125
Oh ye of little faith.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.666
Uh, hate to interrupt--

02:17.666 --> 02:19.416
But you're gonna muscle through it anyway?

02:19.416 --> 02:20.541
Just wanted to say hi.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.625
Then your work is done here, ace.
Good job.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.458
Gabriel Wolf, by the way.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.458
President of Wolf World Communications.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.125
Very excited about your concert.

02:28.125 --> 02:31.416
First ever broadcast
via satellite around the world,

02:31.416 --> 02:32.875
it's kind of impossible not to be.

02:33.791 --> 02:37.458
You know, we bid for the broadcast rights,
but we lost out to NBC, damn it.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.750
Guess you can't win them all.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.958
Well, Gabriel, based on
my personal life experience,

02:41.958 --> 02:43.458
you actually can.

02:43.458 --> 02:44.416
Now, you mind?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.166
Of course.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.416
Good luck tomorrow.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.375
Hey, bet you can't guess
who I just ran into.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.625
Safe bet, given I'm not even gonna try.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.583
<i>Hawaii Five-O</i>'<i>s</i> very own Jack Lord.

02:58.541 --> 03:01.750
Who, turns out, does not like to be
hugged in the men's room, by the way.

03:01.750 --> 03:04.375
He's in town filming the show.
You know I'm a huge fan.

03:04.375 --> 03:06.375
Sounds like Jack knows that now too.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.583
Oh, and speaking of fans,
yours are starting to pile up over there.

03:11.416 --> 03:12.583
Mind if I go say hi?

03:12.583 --> 03:14.583
Oh, I'm used to it.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.875
Back before you know it.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.166
Yes.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.166
Mm-hmm.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.083
Yes, ma'am.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.833
Well, thank you very much.

03:25.416 --> 03:26.541
What are you doing here?

03:26.541 --> 03:30.625
Oh, well, I thought I was in line
to get Don Ho's autograph, so,

03:30.625 --> 03:32.083
color me disappointed.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.250
Come here.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.250
If you're here to try to get me
to come back, you can fucking forget it.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.833
Somebody's doing just fine
in the self-important department. Good.

03:41.833 --> 03:42.916
I'm serious.

03:42.916 --> 03:45.041
News flash,
the world doesn't revolve around you.

03:47.916 --> 03:49.291
Wanna bet?

03:49.291 --> 03:52.416
Hey there, Mrs. P.
You and Elvis having a good time?

03:52.416 --> 03:53.791
Do me a favor, Bertie.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.541
If he ever gets done over there,

03:55.541 --> 03:57.875
tell him I caught a flight
back to Memphis.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.083
I don't give a shit.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.458
Believe whatever you want.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.833
You people just stay away from me.

04:03.833 --> 04:04.791
Done.

04:05.708 --> 04:06.916
Oh, uh, quick question though--

04:06.916 --> 04:09.708
No, I don't fucking know
where Don Ho lives.

04:17.708 --> 04:21.083
<i>And speaking of big things
coming in small packages, coming up,</i>

04:21.083 --> 04:24.500
<i>Hervé Villechaize,
star of the new James Bond film,</i>

04:24.500 --> 04:27.458
<i>stops by our studio
for an exclusive interview.</i>

04:27.458 --> 04:29.291
<i>I'm smoking indoors.</i>

04:29.916 --> 04:31.250
What the hell is this shit?

04:31.250 --> 04:33.083
First I've seen him since I asked him

04:33.083 --> 04:35.708
to go get me some potato chips
from the lobby two days ago.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.333
Looks like he forgot the potato chips.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.541
Is he even alive?

04:39.541 --> 04:40.458
No idea.

04:40.958 --> 04:42.291
Hey, have you seen Priscilla?

04:42.291 --> 04:45.041
Yeah, look, about that.

04:46.583 --> 04:50.208
Oh no, no, no, no.
Don't you even think about it, goddamn it!

05:01.250 --> 05:04.458
- What?
- I know your car-chase face when I see it.

05:04.458 --> 05:08.250
You left all that secret agent
nonsense behind you. Remember?

05:09.500 --> 05:10.666
What about Priscilla?

05:10.666 --> 05:13.083
- She had to catch a flight to Memphis.
- Really?

05:13.083 --> 05:17.041
Something came up.
You should give her a call later.

05:17.041 --> 05:19.666
But right now, you need to get ready.

05:19.666 --> 05:22.208
Bobby Ray will be back
in a sec to pick you up.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.208
Back from where?

05:23.208 --> 05:24.916
- From picking up the kid.
- What kid?

05:24.916 --> 05:26.291
<i>The</i> kid.

05:26.291 --> 05:30.875
Beautiful day, top down,
wind in your hair. Isn't this great?

05:32.000 --> 05:36.416
Yeah, I thought you'd like it.
Least I could do after, well, you know.

05:36.416 --> 05:38.458
Hang on, are we already filming?

05:38.458 --> 05:40.375
Wait, is that my beer back there?

05:44.041 --> 05:45.625
And let me tell you something.

05:45.625 --> 05:48.875
You, my friend, are an inspiration.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.541
Living proof that
even with a shattered windpipe,

05:51.541 --> 05:54.250
collapsed lung, no spleen,
and only half a kidney left,

05:54.250 --> 05:56.375
there is always a silver lining.

05:57.291 --> 06:00.416
No idea what it is, though,
but at least you get to meet Elvis,

06:00.916 --> 06:02.750
for a couple seconds, anyway. No promises.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.750
Want a beer?

06:03.750 --> 06:06.041
After the soundcheck,
you'll come back here.

06:06.041 --> 06:08.208
And I mean straight back here.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.083
I'm sensing a little subtext there.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.708
I saw you talking
to that woman last night.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.583
The bimbo in the tiny bikini.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.625
Okay, this may sound bad, but you're
gonna need to be way more specific.

06:19.208 --> 06:21.375
I'm counting on you. All of you.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.375
CeCe, <i>Hawaii Five-O's</i> Jack Lord.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.416
Nobody knows this island better than you.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.500
Character actor Hervé Villechaize.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.500
Time to put that wonderfully
compact frame of yours to work.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.041
Now get this done.
Otherwise, millions of people could die.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.833
Oh, so no pressure then.
Great. Thanks for that, by the way.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.041
Any other fun news?

06:39.041 --> 06:42.291
One more thing.
These bad guys we've been after?

06:42.291 --> 06:43.541
We finally have a name.

06:43.541 --> 06:46.333
When we captured the asshole
with that blueprint over there,

06:46.333 --> 06:47.708
he gave us one word.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.083
Malus.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.708
And he was wearing this.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.750
Oh! Is that the guy's fucking finger?

06:52.750 --> 06:55.166
Well, it's not
somebody else's fucking finger.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.166
I mean, that would be seriously twisted.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.500
Oh!

07:02.500 --> 07:04.416
Hey there, pookie bear.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.625
No. Still not a thing.
What are you doing here?

07:06.625 --> 07:09.458
What? A girl can't come to Hawaii
to have a little fun?

07:09.458 --> 07:11.750
With that self-absorbed douchebag?

07:11.750 --> 07:12.875
No, she can't.

07:12.875 --> 07:13.875
Mm!

07:13.875 --> 07:15.583
Isn't he great?

07:15.583 --> 07:18.333
We've been sort of
rekindling an old flame.

07:18.333 --> 07:19.833
Bumped into each other in Vietnam,

07:19.833 --> 07:23.916
and he has been
sweeping me off my feet ever since.

07:23.916 --> 07:27.000
- Whoa, hang on.
- It's almost like a fairy tale.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.833
I mean, if fairy tales had, like,

07:29.833 --> 07:32.375
way more vodka tonics and oral sex.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.541
- Oh God!

07:34.916 --> 07:36.166
You okay?

07:36.166 --> 07:38.458
Shut up. What do you mean rekindling?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.625
We had a fling years ago,
before you were born.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.416
If you're about to tell me
Robert Goulet is my father,

07:44.416 --> 07:46.416
then I am going to shoot both of you.

07:46.416 --> 07:47.708
Like, over and over!

07:47.708 --> 07:50.458
Relax. There's not a chance.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.416
I don't think.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.541
Shit! Shit!

07:56.541 --> 07:58.500
Shit! Shit!

07:59.166 --> 08:00.416
Oh shit.

08:00.416 --> 08:01.333
I gotta go.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.416
Telling you, Jack Lord's basically
the mayor of this entire island.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.958
Even lives here.
Show you his house if you want.

08:06.958 --> 08:08.041
Only from the car though.

08:08.041 --> 08:10.750
The cease-and-desist letter
was pretty clear on that.

08:16.416 --> 08:18.083
Hey, CeCe with an E!

08:18.666 --> 08:20.166
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

08:21.916 --> 08:23.875
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

08:23.875 --> 08:26.041
No, no, no! Hervé! The car! The car!

08:27.416 --> 08:29.333
- Say words. Go.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.416
The fuck? Both of them?

08:35.125 --> 08:38.458
Think I'll try the Aloha tacos.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.333
And put yourself down
for a Cadillac, boss.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.000
Yes, sir.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.958
Anything else I can get you, Mr. Presley?

08:43.958 --> 08:46.625
Maybe a side order
of giant fucking asshole.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.875
Ooh, wait a minute, never mind.
Turns out I got one right here.

08:50.791 --> 08:51.625
Fuck off.

08:51.625 --> 08:54.708
Now, is that any way
to talk to an old friend?

08:54.708 --> 08:56.875
No, but since you're not, fuck off.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.458
Just checking in.
Want to see how you're doing, buddy.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.125
Well, I'm about to play
the biggest concert of my life

09:02.125 --> 09:03.916
for the entire fucking planet.

09:03.916 --> 09:06.458
-  Wow.
- So, doing just fine without you.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.583
Ha! Obviously. Need a quick favor though.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.250
Fuck off.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.541
Ah, so you've said.

09:12.541 --> 09:15.458
But what if I told you
there's a problem with your concert?

09:15.958 --> 09:17.125
- Explain.
- Okay.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.000
You remember that sonic weapon
we've been after?

09:20.541 --> 09:23.208
Well, we tracked particles
emitted by that weapon...

09:23.208 --> 09:24.541
Explain faster.

09:24.541 --> 09:25.541
...to outer space.

09:25.541 --> 09:26.958
What are you talking about?

09:26.958 --> 09:29.041
Oh, look who's interested all of a sudden.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.833
Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.416
Attached to the satellite
that'll broadcast your concert

09:33.416 --> 09:35.291
to millions of Elvis fans watching--

09:35.291 --> 09:36.625
Uh, try billions.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.000
Uh, number sounds a tad high.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.250
Your show, your music, is about
to infect people around the world,

09:43.250 --> 09:47.208
turning them into bloodthirsty lunatics.
It'll be a global bloodbath.

09:47.208 --> 09:50.458
Then what the fuck are you doing
sitting here? Take care of it!

09:50.458 --> 09:51.666
That's why I need you.

09:51.666 --> 09:52.791
You've got people.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.541
I got people? I got people? Guess what.

09:54.541 --> 09:57.875
I got two less after your idiot friend
ran over them in the parking lot.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.625
Fucking Bobby Ray.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.250
I'm running out of people I can trust.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.541
What are you talking about?

10:02.541 --> 10:05.083
TCB's got a mole. A traitor.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.625
-  What?
- The stolen sonic tech. The weapon.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.083
It's got to be an inside job.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.000
Won't be long now.

10:15.541 --> 10:16.875
My grand finale.

10:16.875 --> 10:20.208
After tonight,
Elvis Presley will no longer be beloved.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.583
He'll be reviled.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.958
You asked me why I didn't
let you kill him at the Jaycees Awards.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.166
Well, today is why.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.458
The day Elvis goes down in history

10:29.458 --> 10:32.000
as the man whose music
caused millions to die.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.916
The day the world will
finally loathe Elvis as I do,

10:34.916 --> 10:36.750
for as the Bible foretold,

10:36.750 --> 10:40.041
"And the bedazzled,
caped man who sangeth evilly

10:40.041 --> 10:42.458
was finally brought to his knees."

10:42.458 --> 10:45.041
Leviticus 4:12. Pretty sure.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.958
Close enough for me.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.208
So let me get this straight.

10:51.708 --> 10:53.708
You get me drafted into the Army

10:53.708 --> 10:56.875
so you could make
a mind-control device based on my DNA,

10:56.875 --> 10:57.916
that you then lose,

10:57.916 --> 11:01.416
and now has ended up on a fucking
satellite about to destroy the world,

11:01.416 --> 11:03.541
and you want me to do something about it?

11:03.541 --> 11:06.041
Ooh! Well, that was kind of a long road,

11:06.041 --> 11:07.500
but yeah, pretty much.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.125
You realize you're basically asking me
to save the world from myself?

11:11.125 --> 11:14.041
Yeah. And if it's not this concert,
it'll be the next one.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.250
Goddamn it. You know what?

11:16.250 --> 11:18.458
I was doing a hell of a lot better
before I met you.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.958
Oh come on. You were moonlighting
as a dime-store vigilante.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.250
It was pathetic.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.166
I took you global, kid.

11:26.166 --> 11:29.500
No, what you did was take me
down a rabbit hole full of your bullshit.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.166
Yeah. And then
you shot me twice and quit.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.416
After all I did for you.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.416
How do you think that made me feel, huh?

11:35.416 --> 11:36.458
You'll get over it.

11:36.458 --> 11:40.333
- I was emotionally sodomized.
- Where do you come up with this shit?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.916
Writer's room, I don't know.

11:41.916 --> 11:44.041
Point is, are you going to help me or not?

11:44.041 --> 11:45.666
We're running out of time.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.208
Okay, I'll do it.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.208
But not because you asked me.

11:53.208 --> 11:56.583
More because these assholes
aren't about to ruin my show.

11:56.583 --> 12:00.750
And "Elvis Saves the World,"
it's got a nice ring to it.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.625
Ha-ha! And I haven't
even told you the best part yet.

12:14.416 --> 12:16.333
Do you actually enjoy
being this predictable?

12:17.416 --> 12:18.333
Excuse me?

12:18.333 --> 12:20.541
So knew you'd fall for the jetpack.

12:20.541 --> 12:21.750
What's he doing here?

12:21.750 --> 12:23.458
And where the hell are my potato chips?

12:24.666 --> 12:27.541
Yeah, sorry, had to borrow
your little friend here. We need him.

12:27.541 --> 12:28.916
- For what?
- For that.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.708
The capsule was designed for Hervé

12:33.708 --> 12:36.833
to fly up to the satellite
and disarm the sonic weapons.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.750
But since Hervé's busy
bleeding out in a parking lot,

12:39.750 --> 12:41.916
we're gonna have to go
with the next best thing.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.125
Remember all those assholes at NASA

12:44.125 --> 12:46.375
who kicked you out
for arguably understandable reasons?

12:47.375 --> 12:50.833
Well, this is your chance
to prove them wrong. Own it.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.583
Yeah.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.958
No way this ends badly.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.750
Godspeed, drunk monkey.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.041
Godspeed.

13:14.666 --> 13:16.208
Bertie, what are you...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.041
Scatter okay?

13:21.041 --> 13:23.250
He's fine.
It's telemetry from the rocket.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.583
We knew there was a signal station
somewhere on the island

13:25.583 --> 13:28.416
that's been hacking into the satellite,
and now we know where.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.416
Heh. Well, then,
what the hell are we waiting for?

13:35.083 --> 13:38.458
Elvis had
this zapper gun of yours ever since Vegas.

13:38.958 --> 13:39.791
He loves it.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.291
Oh, and it's growing on me too.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.083
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

13:44.083 --> 13:45.750
Wait. Okay.

13:45.750 --> 13:49.666
First off, kind of turned on right now.
I'm just putting that out there. Second--

13:49.666 --> 13:50.708
- Shut up!
- Copy that.

13:50.708 --> 13:53.166
Now where the hell's my Elvis?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.666
Doing what he was born to do.

13:55.666 --> 13:59.125
I'm not gonna let you
ruin that boy's life all over again.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.416
Ruin his life?

14:00.958 --> 14:03.458
That man's literally trying
to save the world right now,

14:03.458 --> 14:06.000
and instead, you want him
to do what, a fucking sound check?

14:09.541 --> 14:12.750
Better not be a scratch on him, or else.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.500
Or else what, exactly?

14:16.083 --> 14:20.583
Okay, if you don't put that thing down,
one of two things is gonna happen here.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.750
Huh. Wonder what the other thing was.

14:31.666 --> 14:35.250
Guess we aim for the cartoonishly large M.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.333
Where are all the bad guys?

14:57.916 --> 15:00.250
You just had to fucking ask,
didn't you?

15:12.166 --> 15:13.125
Ah shit!

15:18.833 --> 15:20.958
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.000
Ha-ha!

15:28.000 --> 15:31.708
Honestly, I don't know which was better,
my aim or my entrance.

15:32.708 --> 15:33.625
Thanks for that.

15:33.625 --> 15:34.625
Don't mention it.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.291
What? You saving my ass?

15:37.291 --> 15:38.500
That won't be a problem.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.041
Now, you, my friend,
have a concert to get to.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.958
Not until we take out that dish.

15:43.958 --> 15:47.250
Oh, get on with your show.
I'll take care of it, trust me.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.375
You know what? I don't think I will.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.416
- Uh...

15:52.416 --> 15:53.750
What are you doing?

15:53.750 --> 15:56.958
Forgot to check the grip
on your rocket launcher there.

15:56.958 --> 15:58.333
Goddamn it.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.333
You know they put
these stupid M's on everything.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.708
It's like they're selling
fucking time-shares.

16:02.708 --> 16:05.000
So you're the fucking traitor.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.166
"Traitor" is such an ugly word.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.750
Accurate, but ugly.

16:14.958 --> 16:17.458
Such a pompous prick!

16:17.458 --> 16:18.583
Correction.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.541
Tony Award-winning pompous prick!

16:21.541 --> 16:23.208
There's a big difference.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.250
Okay, that sucked.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.541
Oh come on. Don't be like that.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.666
We're just getting to the fun part.

16:33.666 --> 16:34.958
For me, I mean.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.666
Remember those experiments

16:37.666 --> 16:40.208
the Commander performed on you
in the Army?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.458
I was there.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.958
<i>Back then,
I was the Commander's right-hand man.</i>

16:48.833 --> 16:52.791
<i>I watched you turn into an animal.
You should have died.</i>

16:53.458 --> 16:54.833
Sorry to disappoint.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.666
And then you came back.

16:56.666 --> 16:59.750
Waltzing into TCB like you own the place,

16:59.750 --> 17:04.458
with your sculpted hair
and your granite jawline,

17:04.458 --> 17:08.000
and-and that pouty yet inviting mouth.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.166
Uh, starting to feel like
this is about something else.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.916
Like you didn't already have it all.

17:13.916 --> 17:16.125
The talent, the legions of fans,

17:16.125 --> 17:17.791
the amazing music.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.208
That wasn't enough?

17:19.208 --> 17:23.083
You had to take TCB away from me too?

17:23.083 --> 17:24.083
Ah.

17:24.791 --> 17:26.375
So you do like my music.

17:26.958 --> 17:30.208
Um, is that seriously
all you got out of that?

17:32.500 --> 17:35.166
Hey! Aren't you
supposed to be boning my mom?

17:35.166 --> 17:36.208
Hyah!

17:38.458 --> 17:39.458
You okay?

17:40.041 --> 17:40.875
Yeah.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.541
- What was that all about?
- Fucking Goulet.

17:43.541 --> 17:45.750
Interesting choice of dying words,

17:45.750 --> 17:48.083
but hey, at least I'm in there somewhere.

17:56.416 --> 17:59.708
Uh, did I miss the fucking meeting?
What the hell'd you do that for?

17:59.708 --> 18:02.708
Ah, believe it or not, he might be my dad.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.583
- So the hell what?

18:22.583 --> 18:24.041
What in the fuck?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.583
Hey, think your super great dad's
gonna mind if I borrow this?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.500
Shut up.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.250
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:55.833 --> 18:59.958
By Jesus
and his seven glorious dwarf apostles,

18:59.958 --> 19:01.666
I swear this ain't over.

19:02.958 --> 19:04.333
Fucking Goulet.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.208
Are you serious? He's the mole?

19:06.208 --> 19:07.166
Very.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.583
Hey, I've been telling folks for years,
this guy is a bag of shit.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.416
Well, either way,

19:13.083 --> 19:14.125
job well done.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.750
We still gotta get Scatter
when he comes back down.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.708
Comes back down? What are you...

19:19.708 --> 19:22.458
No, no, no, that was a one-way trip.
He's stuck up there.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.416
What the fuck are you talking about?

19:24.416 --> 19:26.708
Which is exactly what Hervé would've said.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.250
So, yeah, I didn't tell him either.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.541
- Where are you going?
- To the airport, goddamn it!

19:34.958 --> 19:37.458
- God, I love his angry energy.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.750
Let me get this straight.
You were so consumed with jealousy

19:40.750 --> 19:44.291
over the fake Apollo moon landing
that you spent millions of dollars

19:44.291 --> 19:47.458
to convert this thing
into a half-ass space plane?

19:48.333 --> 19:51.958
Well, when you put it like that,
yeah, it sounds kind of pathetic.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.833
You brought your fucking Grammys?

20:10.541 --> 20:13.000
Are those... potato chips?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.708
That little motherfucker.

20:16.291 --> 20:17.125
Hang on.

20:17.708 --> 20:18.625
What the hell?

20:40.875 --> 20:42.958
Okay, that's just fucking wrong.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.250
I'm going to get him.

20:45.208 --> 20:48.708
You just happened to have
Neil Armstrong's spacesuit handy?

20:48.708 --> 20:51.500
Uh, kinda. Yeah.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.500
Hang on.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.666
You two morons were actually gonna try
and fly this piece of shit to the moon?

20:59.166 --> 21:00.291
Come on, damn it.

21:00.291 --> 21:03.083
I think you're supposed
to blow in his mouth or something.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.333
Obvious STDs notwithstanding.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.541
Why is that like that right now?

21:15.541 --> 21:17.166
Ugh, God, can we go home?

21:17.166 --> 21:19.666
Oh yeah, about that.

21:19.666 --> 21:20.916
Unfortunately, no.

21:20.916 --> 21:22.333
What are you talking about?

21:22.333 --> 21:24.333
Little problem with the heat shield.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.916
Uh, what's the little problem?

21:26.916 --> 21:28.541
I haven't installed one yet.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.333
Uh, we'll burn up on re-entry.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.958
You know, hearing that out loud,

21:31.958 --> 21:33.916
it's kind of
a bigger than a little problem.

21:33.916 --> 21:35.250
God... Jesus!

21:35.250 --> 21:36.583
Wait, what?

21:36.583 --> 21:38.416
Are you out of your fucking mind?

21:42.458 --> 21:43.375
Hang on, E.

21:44.291 --> 21:45.250
You can't do this.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.458
You can't pretend to be
a human heat shield.

21:47.458 --> 21:48.625
You'll burn alive!

21:48.625 --> 21:51.291
Boss, are you sure about this?

21:51.291 --> 21:52.916
I got a show to do, buddy.

21:52.916 --> 21:54.791
You never leave a packed house waiting.

21:54.791 --> 21:55.833
Hey, look at me.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.625
Don't do this!

21:57.625 --> 21:58.625
Look.

21:59.416 --> 22:00.875
I've gotta at least try.

22:01.833 --> 22:03.208
You folks best strap in.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.125
You know what?

22:08.125 --> 22:11.000
Just now realizing
I haven't checked in with Priscilla,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.958
and that's probably not a good sign.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.625
Just take care of yourself.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.666
But yeah, relationship-wise,
it's not a great sign at all.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.208
Howard, listen, I may need you

22:48.208 --> 22:50.750
to resume your cloning research.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.416
<i>Uh... I was supposed to stop?</i>

22:54.000 --> 22:57.583
Yeah, we're probably
gonna need a new Elvis.
