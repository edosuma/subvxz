[CHERYL] <i> Well,

Okay. Well, you should stop going to

00:16.656 --> 00:17.889
I'm still going to go.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.725
Is the reason you're
so obsessed with the Farm

Yes. I see my son.

01:42.741 --> 01:43.940

01:44.009 --> 01:46.410
but they were
willing participants.

01:46.478 --> 01:48.011
Baby Teeth struggled.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.480
Maybe the brutality
of his death was the message.

01:50.549 --> 01:53.016
Like a warning that he's back

01:53.085 --> 01:54.217

02:09.033 --> 02:11.168
I've done a deep-dive
on the Internet,

02:11.236 --> 02:13.770

anyone named Edgar Evernever.

02:18.911 --> 02:20.177
Many years ago,

02:21.146 --> 02:23.747
I was a very different man.

02:25.551 --> 02:30.787
My life was in tatters,
so I left it behind

02:30.856 --> 02:33.123
and I walked in the desert
to die.

02:33.192 --> 02:37.360
Till I stumbled upon a tree
on a hill beside a farm.

02:37.429 --> 02:39.496
I was in Death's clutches.

02:39.565 --> 02:43.233
And somehow I stumbled
to the door of that farm,

02:43.302 --> 02:45.102
and I knocked.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.036
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

02:47.306 --> 02:49.406
When I awoke,
I was in a white room.

02:49.475 --> 02:52.676
I was being tended to
by a kind, elderly farmer.

02:52.745 --> 02:54.611
And I said,
"How can I repay you?"

02:55.914 --> 02:57.981
So she put me to work
on her farm.

02:58.050 --> 03:01.251
I ploughed those fields,
and I sowed them with seed,

03:01.320 --> 03:05.055
and I watched them grow
into something beautiful.

03:06.158 --> 03:08.125
I felt reborn.

03:08.193 --> 03:11.094
After that,
I made it my sacred duty

03:11.163 --> 03:13.764
to open my own farm,

03:13.832 --> 03:17.901
where I could welcome lost
souls wandering in the darkness.

03:18.971 --> 03:20.203
It's a nice story,

03:20.272 --> 03:23.340

how you've convinced my mom

to that process.

see her dead son?

Wait, Mad Dog, what match?

04:29.842 --> 04:31.508

the reason Cheryl

05:52.491 --> 05:54.157
I mean, your mom's lost touch
with reality,

05:54.226 --> 05:57.127
so maybe the best way to
snap her out of her delusions

that Charles is dead.

40:14.961 --> 40:16.327
dodge a murder charge?

40:22.769 --> 40:23.868
Why Baby Teeth?

40:23.936 --> 40:25.970
Did the Gargoyle King
demand a sacrifice?

40:27.440 --> 40:28.606
Baby Teeth.

40:30.276 --> 40:32.109
[CHUCKLING] He was only
the warm-up.

40:34.147 --> 40:35.246
To what?

40:35.314 --> 40:36.947
To the ultimate quest.

40:37.917 --> 40:40.050
To one final game

40:40.753 --> 40:41.752
for you

40:42.889 --> 40:44.288
and your family,

40:45.091 --> 40:46.323
Hellcaster.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.260
It was demanded by the King.

40:51.063 --> 40:53.330
Save the Little Princess.

40:57.970 --> 40:59.870
- Jellybean?
- What the hell did you do?

40:59.939 --> 41:01.172
[SHOUTS] What did you do?

41:02.208 --> 41:04.041
She's been summoned

41:04.110 --> 41:05.743
by the King.

41:05.812 --> 41:09.013
[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

41:13.386 --> 41:14.718
I don't understand.

41:14.787 --> 41:16.620
Why couldn't we just
keep playing in Pop's?

41:16.689 --> 41:18.189
Because, Princess Jellybean,

41:19.025 --> 41:20.191
he wanted to meet you.

41:20.726 --> 41:21.692
Who did?

41:23.596 --> 41:25.362
[CRACKLING]

41:25.431 --> 41:27.331
[LOW GROWL]
