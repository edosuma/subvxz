01:23.277 --> 01:28.281
No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century

01:30.075 --> 01:35.455
that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own.

01:38.042 --> 01:42.378
That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns,

01:43.213 --> 01:46.507
they observed and studied

01:48.218 --> 01:52.138
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

01:52.222 --> 01:56.184
that swarm and multiply
in a drop of water.

01:58.062 --> 02:03.316
with infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe,

02:04.276 --> 02:08.404
confident of our empire over this world.

02:10.491 --> 02:13.785
Yet, across the gulf of space,

02:13.869 --> 02:18.748
intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic

02:19.583 --> 02:23.336
regarded our planet with envious eyes

02:24.129 --> 02:27.507
and slowly and surely

02:27.591 --> 02:31.177
drew their plans against us.

03:25.232 --> 03:27.817
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

03:27.901 --> 03:29.944
It's on its way.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.083
Ray.

03:44.835 --> 03:46.502
Ferrier. Whoa.

03:47.171 --> 03:50.631
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

03:50.716 --> 03:53.968
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

03:54.052 --> 03:57.430
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

03:57.514 --> 03:59.724
I got to have somebody
who can do double picks.

03:59.850 --> 04:03.352
I wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

04:03.437 --> 04:05.730
Come on. I'm in a position here, Ray.

04:05.814 --> 04:09.233
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

04:09.318 --> 04:11.444
You know what your problem is?

04:11.528 --> 04:15.114
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

04:38.222 --> 04:40.139
8:30? Did we say that?

04:40.224 --> 04:42.183
We said 8:00.

04:44.019 --> 04:46.312
Hey, this is...

04:46.396 --> 04:49.565
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

04:49.650 --> 04:52.026
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.113
8:00?

04:57.533 --> 05:00.743
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

05:03.163 --> 05:04.747
There he is.

05:07.251 --> 05:08.834
Get a hug?

05:10.212 --> 05:13.381
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

05:14.258 --> 05:15.508
The door's locked.

05:16.426 --> 05:17.843
Still working on those manners?

05:19.930 --> 05:21.514
Hello, Dad.

05:22.641 --> 05:24.141
Hello, Rachel.

05:27.771 --> 05:30.606
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We got to get to work.

05:36.738 --> 05:39.949
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

05:40.033 --> 05:41.867
- The door's locked.
- Sweetheart, let me get it.

05:41.952 --> 05:45.371
- I don't mind. I don't mind.
- Hey, she said she could get it.

05:45.455 --> 05:46.831
- It's heavy.
- She said she could get it.

05:46.915 --> 05:48.791
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.460
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

05:51.545 --> 05:53.921
Really, I got it from here, okay?

06:00.137 --> 06:02.138
It's a 302 V8. It's...

06:02.639 --> 06:05.182
It's gonna be out of here next week.

06:07.144 --> 06:10.021
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.149
You're out of milk.

06:14.067 --> 06:15.401
And everything else.

06:16.153 --> 06:18.237
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

06:18.322 --> 06:21.073
Because that's my refrigerator.

06:21.825 --> 06:23.909
I'm gonna go wait outside.

06:25.996 --> 06:28.914
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

06:29.333 --> 06:30.958
Bye, Tim.

06:31.710 --> 06:35.087
- I better get this upstairs.
- Let me... Let me get...

06:36.089 --> 06:37.423
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Mary Ann...

06:37.507 --> 06:40.217
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

06:52.648 --> 06:54.523
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

06:54.608 --> 06:57.860
- I don't hear any complaints.
- No, I do.

07:03.700 --> 07:08.245
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation ofAlgeria due Monday,

07:08.330 --> 07:10.206
which he's yet to begin.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.500
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

07:12.584 --> 07:15.461
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

07:15.545 --> 07:17.296
- I just gotta type it up.
- No.

07:17.381 --> 07:21.050
- You just got to start writing it first.
- I love you, Mom.

07:21.134 --> 07:22.843
I love you.

07:24.763 --> 07:26.305
Listen to your father.

07:27.391 --> 07:29.892
No shoes on the bed.

07:30.769 --> 07:33.229
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

07:33.313 --> 07:35.314
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

07:35.399 --> 07:36.899
Well, the point is,
I've got my cell phone,

07:36.983 --> 07:39.819
so if anything comes up
or you have any questions, just call me.

07:39.903 --> 07:41.821
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

07:41.905 --> 07:44.448
- I'll leave the phone on.
- Mary Ann.

07:45.742 --> 07:47.743
It's a good look for you.

07:49.746 --> 07:51.288
You think?

07:52.916 --> 07:54.208
Yeah.

07:56.253 --> 07:58.421
Take care of our kids.

07:58.755 --> 08:01.173
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

08:01.258 --> 08:05.428
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

08:07.556 --> 08:10.057
Right. She'll love that.

08:18.442 --> 08:21.360
the Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,

08:21.445 --> 08:23.529
is in almost total blackness tonight

08:23.613 --> 08:25.948
in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms

08:26.032 --> 08:27.825
of catastrophic proportion,

08:27.909 --> 08:30.745
which struck the country at
approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.

08:33.539 --> 08:37.543
...EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption

08:37.626 --> 08:40.337
of all electrical current within its field.

08:40.422 --> 08:43.758
As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here

08:43.842 --> 08:47.261
was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,

08:47.345 --> 08:50.556
measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...

08:54.227 --> 08:58.147
- Baseball season's over.
- Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

09:00.275 --> 09:01.650
There he is.

09:06.490 --> 09:07.865
Boston?

09:09.326 --> 09:11.076
That's how it is?

09:13.330 --> 09:15.581
Is that how it's gonna be?

09:18.210 --> 09:20.753
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

09:21.505 --> 09:22.838
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

09:22.923 --> 09:24.882
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done here.

09:24.966 --> 09:27.593
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just got to type it up.

09:27.677 --> 09:29.345
Yeah, bullshit.

09:30.514 --> 09:33.432
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

09:33.850 --> 09:36.519
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

09:36.603 --> 09:38.395
we know everything.

09:39.815 --> 09:42.149
What's the capital ofAustralia?

09:42.943 --> 09:44.610
That's one my brother knows.

09:46.696 --> 09:50.533
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

09:53.203 --> 09:54.411
Just do your report.

09:54.496 --> 09:57.289
We don't send you to school
so you can flunk out.

09:57.624 --> 10:00.042
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

10:05.757 --> 10:07.883
That's half what I've got.

10:07.968 --> 10:10.886
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

10:11.471 --> 10:13.055
That why you act like such a dick?

10:29.197 --> 10:30.489
What?

10:31.074 --> 10:33.659
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

10:33.743 --> 10:38.080
- lf you want him to listen to you...
- What are you, your mother or mine?

10:39.583 --> 10:42.167
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to sleep.

10:42.252 --> 10:44.044
I work for a living.

10:45.380 --> 10:48.757
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know, order.

11:13.116 --> 11:15.951
Three and two...

11:17.120 --> 11:19.121
- Electromagnetic storm...
- The storms were tracked...

11:19.205 --> 11:23.584
And I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, hey, Gary?

11:23.668 --> 11:25.961
- No.
- what do you know?

11:26.046 --> 11:27.796
You're a snail.

11:37.599 --> 11:39.099
What's the matter?

11:39.184 --> 11:40.851
Got a splinter.

11:43.396 --> 11:45.856
Where'd you get it? Come here.

11:45.941 --> 11:47.691
On your porch railing.

11:47.776 --> 11:51.487
Do you need me to... What?
To do what? You want me to...

11:53.114 --> 11:55.991
- You want me to take that out?
- Absolutely not.

11:56.076 --> 11:59.495
Come here. Let me see it. Let me see.

11:59.579 --> 12:00.996
Dad.

12:01.081 --> 12:02.998
- Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
- Rach.

12:03.083 --> 12:07.002
- I can't. You're moving it around.
- Okay, but don't touch it. Just look at it.

12:08.004 --> 12:09.588
It's gonna get infected.

12:09.673 --> 12:11.423
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna get infected.

12:11.508 --> 12:13.425
No, it won't.

12:13.510 --> 12:17.179
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

12:18.139 --> 12:20.516
- Push it out, huh?
- I read that.

12:23.853 --> 12:25.729
You should get TiVo.

12:26.439 --> 12:28.440
- Tim got it for my room.
- TiVo?

12:28.525 --> 12:29.942
It's awesome.

12:30.860 --> 12:33.570
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

12:35.031 --> 12:37.574
Yeah, I'll just put it on my platinum card.

12:37.659 --> 12:40.119
Robbie? Robbie.

12:44.874 --> 12:46.625
What is that?

12:48.003 --> 12:49.461
Hummus.

12:49.921 --> 12:53.173
- Hummus?
- From the health-food place.

12:53.258 --> 12:55.634
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

12:59.055 --> 13:00.889
You said order.

13:01.808 --> 13:03.726
I meant order food.

13:04.894 --> 13:06.437
Where is Robbie?

13:06.521 --> 13:08.981
- He went out.
- Out where?

13:09.065 --> 13:12.484
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

13:12.610 --> 13:15.029
Who said that? Who's there?

13:15.113 --> 13:16.947
It's the clam burglar.

13:44.893 --> 13:46.268
Steven, look at this.

13:46.352 --> 13:48.771
- What's up?
- Check it out!

13:52.400 --> 13:55.110
You ever see something like that?

13:55.195 --> 13:57.821
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

13:57.906 --> 14:01.116
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

14:22.722 --> 14:24.890
You got to come see this!

14:36.027 --> 14:38.821
- That is so weird.
- What?

14:39.489 --> 14:41.740
The wind is blowing toward the storm.

14:41.825 --> 14:43.951
That is weird.

14:44.035 --> 14:45.911
Hey, watch it!

14:47.789 --> 14:50.374
Rachel, you wanna see something cool?

15:23.992 --> 15:25.784
It's okay.

15:25.869 --> 15:28.078
- I wanna go inside.
- It's okay.

15:28.163 --> 15:29.997
I wanna go inside.

15:30.665 --> 15:32.374
Okay, you go ahead.

15:34.335 --> 15:36.712
That's enough weather for me.

15:37.213 --> 15:39.423
Don't wanna go by myself.

15:44.095 --> 15:46.889
- It's kind of fun, isn't it?
- No.

15:46.973 --> 15:49.975
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.
- No, it's not.

15:50.059 --> 15:51.852
Oh, say can...

16:02.572 --> 16:04.406
It's okay. You're fine.

16:04.490 --> 16:07.034
- It hit right behind our house.
- Yeah, well, it's...

16:07.118 --> 16:08.827
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

16:08.912 --> 16:11.663
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place.

16:11.748 --> 16:12.998
Shit!

16:18.546 --> 16:20.255
Where's Robbie?

16:21.758 --> 16:23.258
I don't know.

16:24.636 --> 16:26.595
Is Robbie okay?

16:28.765 --> 16:30.682
Are you okay?

16:30.767 --> 16:32.726
Where's the thunder?

16:33.228 --> 16:34.937
Why won't it stop?

16:49.118 --> 16:50.744
Is it over?

17:06.094 --> 17:07.426
Where are you going?

17:07.512 --> 17:11.640
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait. Wait there.

17:11.723 --> 17:14.434
- Are we gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

17:14.519 --> 17:16.686
- You don't know?
- No, I meant, I just...

17:16.771 --> 17:18.521
Rachel, please.

17:18.606 --> 17:21.983
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

17:59.856 --> 18:02.149
Turn everything off.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.067
Everything is off.

18:04.152 --> 18:07.529
I can't get one freaking thing to turn on.

18:09.532 --> 18:12.492
You believe this, Ray? Every single car.

18:14.412 --> 18:16.413
Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

18:16.497 --> 18:18.206
- The car just stopped, and...
- You're okay?

18:18.291 --> 18:20.042
- Are you okay? You all right?
- The lightning started to hit

18:20.126 --> 18:21.460
about a block away,
over and over again.

18:21.544 --> 18:23.587
- And me and this other guy...
- Where the hell did you go?

18:23.671 --> 18:26.256
- Over on Lincoln Avenue.
- Lincoln Avenue?

18:26.341 --> 18:27.632
- By the church.
- You see it? You saw the lightning?

18:27.717 --> 18:29.259
- Were you near it?
- Yeah, 26 times we counted,

18:29.344 --> 18:30.344
over and over again.

18:30.428 --> 18:32.971
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

18:33.056 --> 18:34.056
- I don't know.
- Twenty-six times?

18:34.140 --> 18:35.599
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:36.392 --> 18:37.809
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

18:37.894 --> 18:39.936
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

18:40.021 --> 18:43.357
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

18:43.441 --> 18:47.569
The next time you take my car with
no driver's license and no permission,

18:47.653 --> 18:49.237
I call the cops.

18:51.157 --> 18:53.408
You better be there when I get back.

18:54.285 --> 18:56.328
- Yeah.
- Robbie.

19:01.250 --> 19:04.503
Manny, Manny. Manny, what is it, dead?

19:04.587 --> 19:07.255
All of them. Everything. Look at this.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.591
- The starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

19:09.675 --> 19:12.135
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

19:12.220 --> 19:14.679
- You got any idea what's going on?
- I'm on my way to find out.

19:14.764 --> 19:16.890
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

19:16.974 --> 19:19.434
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

19:20.144 --> 19:24.898
Hey, they're saying all the lightning
struck down by the church.

19:35.118 --> 19:37.786
What the hell is going on around here?

19:39.288 --> 19:40.664
- Let us through.
- Hey.

19:40.748 --> 19:42.040
- Let us through here.
- Hey, hey.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.959
What up, Ray?

19:44.043 --> 19:45.752
I should've known
you two were behind this.

19:45.837 --> 19:47.838
Hey, God's pissed off
at the neighborhood, Raymond.

19:47.922 --> 19:48.922
- I'll tell you that much.
- Can you blame him?

19:49.006 --> 19:50.006
- You see it?
- Yeah.

19:50.091 --> 19:52.509
- You got power where you are?
- Nope. Nothing.

19:52.593 --> 19:54.052
It's the cars, though.
You know, that's the thing.

19:54.137 --> 19:56.221
Solar flare.
That's what this guy told me he heard.

19:56.305 --> 19:57.889
- A solar flare?
- Yeah, he says the sun shoots off

19:57.974 --> 19:59.433
- these big blobs of plasma.
- Let me tell you something.

19:59.517 --> 20:02.060
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

20:02.145 --> 20:04.229
- all the electronic stuff like that.
- Can I tell you something?

20:04.313 --> 20:05.730
The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

20:05.815 --> 20:07.190
Bro, I'm just telling you
what that guy said he heard.

20:07.275 --> 20:09.734
Okay, I understand, but it just
sounds dumb when you're saying that.

20:16.409 --> 20:18.034
I've never seen anything like this before.

20:18.119 --> 20:20.579
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

20:20.663 --> 20:22.247
- Is this the only place?
- Come on, put that down.

20:22.331 --> 20:24.916
- You wanna step back, please?
- Step back.

20:25.001 --> 20:27.252
- You're gonna fall in.
- Get back.

20:29.338 --> 20:32.841
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

20:33.759 --> 20:36.803
Move back. Everybody back up.

20:36.888 --> 20:40.348
Move back.

20:44.187 --> 20:45.520
Is it hot?

20:45.605 --> 20:47.439
No.

20:47.523 --> 20:49.774
- It's freezing.
- What is that?

20:49.859 --> 20:51.610
Hey, move. You feel that?

20:51.694 --> 20:54.821
- I feel that.
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

20:55.281 --> 20:56.656
- You feel that?
- Feel that?

20:56.741 --> 20:58.533
- Yeah, I feel that.
- What is it, the subway?

20:58.618 --> 21:00.952
- There's no subway here.
- F train, maybe?

21:01.037 --> 21:02.454
That can't be the water main.

21:02.538 --> 21:03.872
There's nothing else down there.

21:03.956 --> 21:05.624
- Water main doesn't run through here.
- Feel that?

21:05.708 --> 21:07.542
Well, there's something down there
and it's moving.

21:12.757 --> 21:15.091
Everybody, move back.

21:15.426 --> 21:17.385
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

21:18.221 --> 21:19.554
Let's go.

21:20.389 --> 21:23.016
Come on, folks. Back up. Get back.

21:30.733 --> 21:33.693
Help me out here. Get back.

21:38.491 --> 21:40.242
- Go! Move!
- Everybody, get out of the way!

21:40.326 --> 21:43.203
Everyone, back up!
Everyone, clear the intersection!

21:43.287 --> 21:47.374
Get out of the way! Back up! Back up!
Get out of the way!

22:04.183 --> 22:08.228
- Forget it! Get back!
- Get the hell out of the street!

22:19.907 --> 22:21.575
Move away!

22:22.493 --> 22:25.287
Come on,
we've got to clear this area now!

23:15.755 --> 23:17.505
That's my car!

23:20.009 --> 23:21.426
Go, go.

23:21.510 --> 23:23.678
Get the hell out of here!

23:47.912 --> 23:49.829
Oh, my God!

23:50.873 --> 23:52.040
Come on, people! Let's go!

23:52.124 --> 23:53.875
Come on, back up!

23:53.959 --> 23:56.544
Please! Move back!

25:18.961 --> 25:20.462
Watch it!

25:22.965 --> 25:24.799
Oh, my God.

25:26.260 --> 25:28.470
Ray, no. Stay, man.

25:37.354 --> 25:39.105
Just stay.

25:39.648 --> 25:43.485
- Just stay back here. Stay back!
- Wow.

25:59.168 --> 26:00.502
Come on.

28:14.845 --> 28:16.804
What happened?

28:18.891 --> 28:20.600
What's going on?

28:21.602 --> 28:23.478
Dad, what's the matter?

28:24.647 --> 28:26.814
What's all that stuff all over you?

28:30.527 --> 28:32.236
- Ray.
- What's all this stuff?

28:32.321 --> 28:33.696
Hello?

28:34.448 --> 28:35.907
Ray?

29:09.942 --> 29:12.276
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

29:12.361 --> 29:13.611
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

29:13.696 --> 29:16.280
You're responsible for all the food
from the refrigerator and the cupboard,

29:16.365 --> 29:17.615
- and put it in here.
- What's going on?

29:17.700 --> 29:19.701
- Just tell me.
- Just do it.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.620
- Rachel, sweetheart...
- Dad, you're really scaring me.

29:22.705 --> 29:25.123
...I need you to get your suitcase...
- Dad.

29:25.207 --> 29:27.792
...the one that you brought,
bring it to me, okay?

29:27.876 --> 29:31.004
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

29:45.894 --> 29:47.520
I don't think it's a fire.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.941
- See? That looks like smoke to me.
- What's happening?

29:52.026 --> 29:55.987
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

30:02.161 --> 30:05.580
Please.

30:11.712 --> 30:14.005
- Just keep it down.
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

30:14.089 --> 30:16.299
Can you please answer me?

30:17.885 --> 30:20.386
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

30:25.184 --> 30:26.684
- Whose car is this?
- Just get in.

30:26.769 --> 30:28.603
Whose car is this?

30:31.273 --> 30:33.858
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

30:33.942 --> 30:36.486
That is exact... I had to change the...

30:37.613 --> 30:39.614
Ray? Hey.

30:39.698 --> 30:42.075
Hey, Ray? Ray.

30:43.118 --> 30:44.619
Ray.

30:45.621 --> 30:49.082
What? Come on, open up.
Open the door, come on.

30:49.166 --> 30:52.001
- Open the door, Ray. What are you...
- Get in, Manny.

30:52.086 --> 30:53.336
That's funny.
You got to get out of the car.

30:53.420 --> 30:55.213
- Manny, get in the car.
- It's not my car. It's not your car.

30:55.297 --> 30:56.380
Manny, listen to me, pal.

30:56.465 --> 30:58.216
- Manny, Manny, shut up.
- Kids, Daddy's acting crazy.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.218
You can't do this. Guy's gonna
come back, he's not gonna...

31:00.302 --> 31:01.928
Manny. Manny,
I don't have time to explain.

31:02.012 --> 31:03.554
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

31:03.639 --> 31:05.098
- Manny, listen to me.
- No, Ray. Get out of the...

31:05.182 --> 31:07.683
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

31:07.768 --> 31:09.519
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

31:11.146 --> 31:12.647
All right, get out of the truck.
I'm not kidding now.

31:12.731 --> 31:14.482
Get out of the car, Ray.

31:14.566 --> 31:16.400
I'm not gonna get in. I'm not getting in.

31:16.485 --> 31:19.237
- Manny, get in with us.
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

31:19.321 --> 31:22.657
- Look, I'm not fooling around...
- Close the door. Close it.

31:23.450 --> 31:27.078
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

31:31.917 --> 31:34.418
Get down! Get down, get down!
Get down!

31:34.503 --> 31:35.753
Is it the terrorists?

31:35.838 --> 31:38.798
- Just get down. Get down! Get down!
- Holy shit!

32:10.956 --> 32:13.124
- Where are we going?
- We got to go.

32:13.208 --> 32:15.126
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

32:15.210 --> 32:18.296
- I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
- Clear of what?

32:18.380 --> 32:19.797
- We got to go.
- What the hell is going on?

32:19.882 --> 32:22.383
- Look, you saw, we're under attack!
- By who?

32:22.467 --> 32:23.801
Who is attacking us?

32:23.886 --> 32:26.679
Rachel?
Rachel, you've got to keep it down.

32:26.763 --> 32:28.806
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

32:28.891 --> 32:32.977
- You're freaking her out!
- Look, I'm driving! Do something!

32:33.061 --> 32:35.479
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

32:35.564 --> 32:38.399
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

32:38.483 --> 32:39.901
- Yes.
- You're safe in your space.

32:39.985 --> 32:41.444
- I'm safe in my space.
- You're safe in your space.

32:41.528 --> 32:43.154
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

32:43.238 --> 32:44.280
- Okay.
- I'm really scared.

32:44.364 --> 32:45.865
I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

32:45.949 --> 32:47.241
- No.
- I'll be two feet away. Okay?

32:47.326 --> 32:48.826
- Okay.
- Will you hold my hand?

32:48.911 --> 32:50.036
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.954
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

32:53.957 --> 32:56.125
I wanna know everything you know.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.336
This...

32:58.420 --> 33:00.296
This thing, this machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

33:00.380 --> 33:03.841
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

33:03.926 --> 33:06.636
What is it? Is it terrorists?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.513
No, this came from someplace else.

33:09.598 --> 33:13.392
- What do you mean, like Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

33:23.695 --> 33:28.157
That machine, it was already buried.

33:29.284 --> 33:31.410
Maybe it...

33:31.495 --> 33:34.622
It came down in the lightning storm.

33:35.290 --> 33:38.709
- They came down in the lightning storm.
- What do you mean "came down"?

33:38.794 --> 33:41.754
- You just said it was buried.
- No, the machine I'm talking about

33:41.838 --> 33:45.967
was buried, but what came down
in the lightning storm,

33:46.051 --> 33:50.554
what operates it, that's the... You know.

33:50.639 --> 33:52.014
- The what?
- That's the...

33:52.099 --> 33:54.642
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

33:54.726 --> 33:57.395
- It's the what?
- Hey, Rach. How you doing there, girl?

33:57.479 --> 33:58.813
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

33:58.897 --> 34:00.022
- Fine.
- She's good.

34:00.107 --> 34:02.483
Yeah? Good.
What was that thing you did with her?

34:02.567 --> 34:03.776
Works sometimes.
She gets claustrophobic.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.278
Yeah? Hey, Rachel? Hey.

34:05.362 --> 34:07.238
- I want Mom.
- Yeah, I know. You feel better?

34:07.322 --> 34:10.533
- I want Mom.
- Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

34:10.617 --> 34:12.034
- Take me to Mom's.
- Listen, what I need you to do is,

34:12.119 --> 34:14.370
is I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

34:14.454 --> 34:15.705
I want Mom!

34:15.789 --> 34:18.081
When you start screaming like that,
you know, I can't really drive...

34:18.166 --> 34:19.667
- Take me to Mom's!
- I know that.

34:19.751 --> 34:21.252
That's where we're going right now.

34:21.335 --> 34:22.670
- Rachel...
- Take me to Mom's!

34:22.754 --> 34:24.338
I know!

34:40.147 --> 34:42.188
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

34:49.197 --> 34:51.114
Robbie, get the door.

34:53.034 --> 34:54.618
Mom!

34:54.703 --> 34:56.454
- Mom!
- Mom!

34:56.538 --> 34:58.372
Mom!

34:59.041 --> 35:06.547
Mom? Tim?

35:10.010 --> 35:11.719
- Mom?
- Mom?

35:11.803 --> 35:14.472
- Tim?
- Tim?

35:16.183 --> 35:17.892
Tim?

35:18.727 --> 35:19.894
Mom?

35:22.022 --> 35:23.564
They're gone.

35:23.648 --> 35:25.775
Is she dead?

35:25.859 --> 35:27.693
She's not dead. All right?

35:27.778 --> 35:29.445
She's just not here, okay?

35:29.529 --> 35:31.906
- They were never here.
- How do you know?

35:31.990 --> 35:34.241
Because they're on their way to Boston.

35:34.326 --> 35:37.370
And so they just
kept on going up to Boston.

35:37.454 --> 35:39.163
They're probably
at your grandma's house by now.

35:39.247 --> 35:40.498
I'm gonna call her.

35:40.582 --> 35:43.459
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

35:43.543 --> 35:46.504
Because nothing bad happened here.
Okay?

35:46.588 --> 35:48.923
So we're safe here. All right?

35:49.007 --> 35:51.175
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

35:51.259 --> 35:54.637
- Okay, you are safe...
- Dad, that's not how it goes.

35:54.721 --> 35:57.515
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

35:57.599 --> 36:00.768
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

36:00.852 --> 36:02.103
- What do we have? We have...
- Busy signal.

36:02.187 --> 36:04.021
- It's one of the fast ones.
- What is this? Ketchup, mustard...

36:04.106 --> 36:07.233
- You think all the circuits are down?
- Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

36:07.317 --> 36:10.027
You know, this is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

36:10.112 --> 36:13.197
- What the hell is this?
- That's all that was in your kitchen.

36:13.281 --> 36:15.908
Okay. That's all right.

36:16.910 --> 36:19.036
All right. Okay.

36:22.457 --> 36:24.542
Food. Bread.

36:25.627 --> 36:28.129
Okay. We're gonna have...

36:29.339 --> 36:31.132
Let's get some sandwiches.

36:33.844 --> 36:35.428
Wanna see me deal?

36:36.138 --> 36:37.972
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

36:38.056 --> 36:40.683
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

36:40.767 --> 36:42.852
There's two for me, one for the house.

36:46.148 --> 36:47.565
Okay.

36:47.649 --> 36:50.484
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

36:50.569 --> 36:53.404
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

36:53.488 --> 36:56.615
- Maybe a little blackjack.
- I'm allergic to peanut butter.

36:57.409 --> 36:59.118
Since when?

36:59.202 --> 37:00.494
Birth.

37:04.207 --> 37:05.958
Okay, well, here.

37:06.042 --> 37:08.085
You can eat the bread. Okay?

37:08.170 --> 37:09.628
I'm not hungry.

37:11.173 --> 37:12.923
Okay, well,

37:13.008 --> 37:15.342
Robbie and I are gonna be eating
peanut butter sandwiches.

37:15.427 --> 37:18.512
- Want jelly on this sandwich?
- I'm not hungry either.

37:18.597 --> 37:21.891
You're not hungry either? Okay.

37:21.975 --> 37:24.268
Okay, that's fine.

37:33.153 --> 37:35.362
Everybody just relax, okay?

37:35.447 --> 37:38.949
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

37:39.034 --> 37:41.243
And in the morning,
your mom and Tim are gonna be here.

37:41.328 --> 37:42.953
And everything's gonna be fine.

37:43.038 --> 37:44.497
Okay?

37:45.957 --> 37:47.374
Okay.

37:51.379 --> 37:53.881
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

37:53.965 --> 37:57.301
- We've got perfectly good beds.
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

37:57.385 --> 37:58.886
What are you afraid
is gonna happen to us?

37:58.970 --> 38:00.554
Nice basement.

38:00.639 --> 38:03.891
I wanna sleep in my bed.
I've got back problems.

38:05.644 --> 38:07.269
Okay. Well...

38:07.354 --> 38:09.980
You know on the weather channel
when there's a tornado,

38:10.065 --> 38:12.691
and they tell you to go down
to the basement for safety? It's like that.

38:12.776 --> 38:14.818
- There's gonna be tornadoes?
- Okay, Rachel.

38:14.903 --> 38:17.530
Hey, no more talking, okay?

38:17.614 --> 38:19.573
- Could you be a little nicer to me?
- No more talking.

38:19.658 --> 38:20.950
God.

38:25.830 --> 38:26.914
- Wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

38:26.998 --> 38:28.582
- Good.
- Good night. Love you.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.417
Love you, Rach.

39:44.868 --> 39:46.827
Is the lightning back?

39:48.163 --> 39:50.331
No, this is something else.

40:10.018 --> 40:12.603
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

40:12.687 --> 40:14.104
Is it them? Is it them?

40:16.149 --> 40:17.358
We got to go.

40:17.442 --> 40:19.318
Where do we go?
Robbie, this is your house.

40:19.402 --> 40:20.944
Where do we go?

40:31.998 --> 40:33.624
No, no, no, wait!

40:52.644 --> 40:55.104
Are we still alive?

42:47.801 --> 42:49.551
Down here.

42:53.807 --> 42:55.766
Were you on this plane?

42:56.976 --> 42:59.228
Are you... Are you a passenger?

43:06.152 --> 43:09.071
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

43:11.574 --> 43:13.450
Are you a passenger?

43:13.535 --> 43:15.327
He's deaf.

43:15.411 --> 43:19.122
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

43:19.207 --> 43:20.666
You hear that, Max?

43:20.750 --> 43:23.544
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

43:24.212 --> 43:26.046
Where were you?

43:26.548 --> 43:29.258
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

43:29.342 --> 43:31.301
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

43:31.386 --> 43:32.970
The 83rd Mechanized.

43:33.054 --> 43:35.347
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

43:35.431 --> 43:37.140
They've got some kind of shield
around them.

43:37.225 --> 43:39.977
You can't see it, but everything
we fire at them detonates too early,

43:40.061 --> 43:43.313
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

43:43.398 --> 43:47.192
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

43:47.861 --> 43:50.070
There's more than one?

43:51.155 --> 43:52.823
You got to be kidding me, right?

43:54.284 --> 43:56.493
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

43:56.578 --> 43:59.037
So we patched over to DC,
they went down.

43:59.122 --> 44:01.957
LA, Chicago, uplinked to London.

44:02.041 --> 44:05.294
Even called the affiliates
to try to get them to catch the feed,

44:05.378 --> 44:08.213
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

44:08.298 --> 44:12.217
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

44:23.271 --> 44:25.022
My God.

44:26.107 --> 44:28.066
You ain't seen nothing yet.

44:30.904 --> 44:34.197
I saw that storm.
I was right in the middle of one of those.

44:34.282 --> 44:35.991
Well, you didn't see it like this.

44:36.075 --> 44:38.535
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

44:38.620 --> 44:41.622
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

44:41.706 --> 44:45.918
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

44:46.002 --> 44:47.711
Watch it.

44:49.130 --> 44:50.589
Watch the lightning.

44:50.673 --> 44:52.925
Keep watching the lightning.

44:56.638 --> 44:58.639
What is that?

44:58.806 --> 45:03.060
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

45:03.144 --> 45:06.104
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

45:09.067 --> 45:11.068
You hear that?

45:11.152 --> 45:13.570
We're getting the hell out of here.

45:16.991 --> 45:18.742
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

45:20.328 --> 45:23.413
Hey, were you on that plane?

45:25.458 --> 45:28.794
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

45:30.505 --> 45:32.673
Look at me. Look at me.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.092
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

45:35.176 --> 45:37.135
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around me.

45:37.845 --> 45:40.973
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna want to look around.

45:41.057 --> 45:42.766
But you're not going to.

45:42.850 --> 45:44.393
- Are you?
- No.

45:44.686 --> 45:48.188
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

45:48.272 --> 45:49.564
I'm going right to Boston.

45:49.649 --> 45:51.984
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

45:52.068 --> 45:54.152
That's a girl. That's my girl. Now listen.

45:54.237 --> 45:56.071
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

45:56.155 --> 45:58.615
Got them closed? There you go.

45:58.700 --> 46:01.034
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

46:06.332 --> 46:07.874
Robbie, get in.

46:09.585 --> 46:11.378
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

46:11.462 --> 46:12.963
It's okay.

46:15.550 --> 46:17.050
Get in.

46:37.530 --> 46:40.032
- Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
- Because I don't want everybody

46:40.116 --> 46:42.659
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

46:42.744 --> 46:46.079
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

46:46.164 --> 46:50.417
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

46:50.501 --> 46:53.420
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

46:53.504 --> 46:55.714
- Hiding in their basements.
- lf we had any balls, we'd go back there

46:55.798 --> 46:59.468
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

46:59.552 --> 47:01.636
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, okay?

47:01.721 --> 47:03.305
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

47:03.389 --> 47:04.848
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it, Robbie.

47:04.932 --> 47:06.975
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

47:07.060 --> 47:08.477
- It's "Dad," "sir"...
- Don't fight!

47:08.561 --> 47:10.687
...or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

47:10.772 --> 47:14.066
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

47:14.609 --> 47:17.444
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

47:19.739 --> 47:22.032
I've got to go to the bathroom.

47:22.867 --> 47:24.451
Really?

47:30.958 --> 47:33.293
- I got to go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

47:33.377 --> 47:35.337
There's two things
we got to watch out for.

47:35.421 --> 47:38.006
And the second is people
who might want our car.

47:38.091 --> 47:40.842
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I got to go.

47:48.518 --> 47:51.353
All right. Rachel?
Rachel, it's good right there.

47:51.437 --> 47:53.730
I'm not going in front of you guys.

47:53.815 --> 47:56.233
All right,
then just go where I can see you.

47:56.317 --> 47:57.818
Are you crazy?

47:57.902 --> 47:59.903
- Don't look!
- Well, I'm not gonna look.

47:59.987 --> 48:02.823
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

48:04.242 --> 48:07.119
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

48:07.203 --> 48:10.497
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

48:11.999 --> 48:13.708
Making a list.

48:56.002 --> 48:59.462
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

49:14.228 --> 49:15.812
Stop! Don't go!

49:15.897 --> 49:18.148
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

49:18.232 --> 49:20.567
Let me on! Give me a hand!

49:20.651 --> 49:22.235
Wait! Stop!

49:22.361 --> 49:24.154
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Hey, watch it, kid,

49:24.238 --> 49:25.280
you're gonna get yourself run over!

49:25.364 --> 49:28.325
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

49:28.409 --> 49:31.411
- Robbie, you wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop! Wait!

49:31.495 --> 49:34.289
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

49:34.373 --> 49:36.750
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

49:36.834 --> 49:39.085
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

49:39.170 --> 49:41.463
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

49:41.547 --> 49:43.048
You tell me what we're doing.
What do we do?

49:43.132 --> 49:45.508
We catch up with these soldiers!
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,

49:45.593 --> 49:47.052
and we get back at them.

49:47.136 --> 49:50.597
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

49:50.681 --> 49:55.018
Now let's try one that doesn't involve
your 10-year-old sister joining the Army.

49:55.102 --> 49:57.354
- You have anything like that?
- Why don't you just tell us the truth?

49:57.438 --> 49:59.606
- Wanna try something like that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

49:59.690 --> 50:02.234
- You have anything like that?
- You wanna come off all wise and shit!

50:02.318 --> 50:05.028
You only chose Boston
because you hoped Mom was there.

50:05.112 --> 50:07.530
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

50:07.615 --> 50:11.284
You can dump us on her, and then
you'll only have to care about yourself,

50:11.369 --> 50:14.371
which is exactly the way you like it.

50:15.915 --> 50:19.709
Robbie! Where are you trying to go?

50:19.794 --> 50:22.254
What are you trying to do?

50:23.214 --> 50:26.258
Who's gonna take care of me if you go?

50:44.318 --> 50:47.320
This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.

50:47.655 --> 50:50.365
If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages

50:50.449 --> 50:54.452
from federajl, state or jlocajl authorities
would have followed the alert tone.

50:54.537 --> 50:57.539
This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...

50:59.125 --> 51:02.252
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit?

51:02.920 --> 51:05.005
I don't have a license.

51:06.090 --> 51:08.466
Since when has that stopped you?

51:39.081 --> 51:40.832
Ray.

51:42.835 --> 51:45.170
Ray! Dad!

51:48.799 --> 51:50.342
You think you could...

51:50.426 --> 51:53.136
You think you could...
Do you think you could...

51:53.888 --> 51:55.388
Don't stop.

51:55.473 --> 51:57.640
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

51:57.725 --> 52:00.810
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

52:00.895 --> 52:03.772
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

52:03.856 --> 52:05.982
But we do, right?

52:06.067 --> 52:07.984
Yeah, we do.

52:19.747 --> 52:21.414
Why did he do that?

52:23.584 --> 52:25.668
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

52:25.753 --> 52:29.005
- Everybody just wants a ride.
- Can we give him one?

52:29.090 --> 52:32.717
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

52:32.802 --> 52:34.761
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

52:37.932 --> 52:39.933
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

52:40.017 --> 52:42.268
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please!

52:45.439 --> 52:47.357
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

52:47.441 --> 52:49.317
Please, get away from the car.

52:49.402 --> 52:51.277
Hey! Stop the car.

52:51.362 --> 52:54.114
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

52:54.990 --> 52:57.242
You could carry 20 people in there!

52:57.326 --> 52:59.702
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

52:59.787 --> 53:01.454
Stop the car!

53:05.418 --> 53:07.043
Hold on.

53:07.128 --> 53:08.711
- Wait, wait.
- Look out. Look out.

53:08.796 --> 53:10.380
Look out! Hold on!

53:19.265 --> 53:20.515
Are you okay?

53:30.484 --> 53:31.651
Stop!

53:31.735 --> 53:33.153
- Ray!
- Robbie!

53:33.946 --> 53:35.488
No, wait! Wait!

53:35.573 --> 53:38.575
No! No, just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

53:38.659 --> 53:40.660
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

53:40.744 --> 53:42.287
Rachel!

53:42.913 --> 53:44.664
Get out of there!

53:46.000 --> 53:47.834
Robbie!

53:55.009 --> 53:57.135
Daddy!

53:57.219 --> 53:59.679
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

54:04.685 --> 54:07.479
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

54:07.563 --> 54:09.689
Rachel, get... Get out of the car.

54:09.773 --> 54:11.941
- Get out!
- Daddy!

54:19.658 --> 54:21.784
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car! Get off the car!

54:21.869 --> 54:26.956
Get off! Get off the car. Move! Move!

54:27.041 --> 54:28.041
Where's my son?

54:28.125 --> 54:29.125
You don't need that, man.
Put the gun down.

54:29.210 --> 54:31.669
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

54:31.754 --> 54:33.046
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

54:33.130 --> 54:34.714
Put it down.

54:39.762 --> 54:41.387
Dad!

54:43.224 --> 54:44.974
Okay, man, now, listen.

54:45.142 --> 54:48.186
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

54:48.270 --> 54:50.396
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- Please. All I want...

54:50.481 --> 54:53.149
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

54:53.234 --> 54:55.777
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

54:55.861 --> 54:57.820
Please, let me...
Let me just take my daughter. Can I...

54:57.905 --> 54:59.447
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:59.532 --> 55:00.782
- Go ahead, man. Take her.
- Take my daughter?

55:00.866 --> 55:01.824
Take her. Yeah. Yeah.

55:01.909 --> 55:03.535
Robbie.

55:12.962 --> 55:14.754
Take me with you.

56:16.358 --> 56:18.401
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

56:18.485 --> 56:21.237
He needs his medicine.

56:32.166 --> 56:34.083
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

56:34.168 --> 56:37.253
The US, mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

56:37.338 --> 56:39.047
There's nothing going on in Europe.

56:39.131 --> 56:41.841
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

56:41.925 --> 56:44.427
- Completely wiped out some of it.
- I don't give a shit who it is.

56:44.511 --> 56:46.971
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

56:47.056 --> 56:48.931
If they're all over the place, we're dead.

56:49.016 --> 56:51.893
- Looks like the power's still on here.
- Yeah.

56:51.977 --> 56:54.020
Yeah, power's still on.

56:54.188 --> 56:57.106
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

56:57.191 --> 57:00.526
- Hold on. Hold on, move back.
- Watch out there, lady.

57:01.028 --> 57:03.029
I said, move back.

57:39.483 --> 57:43.778
unless you are O-positive
and Rh-negative, thank you very much,

57:43.862 --> 57:46.864
but we already have
more blood than we can use.

57:46.949 --> 57:50.451
Again, if you are O-positive,

57:50.536 --> 57:54.080
Rh-negative, identify yourselves.

57:54.164 --> 57:56.290
If you are not, thank you very much.

57:56.375 --> 57:59.419
we already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.

57:59.503 --> 58:01.587
Let's go, folks.

58:01.672 --> 58:04.590
This way. This way. Keep it moving.

58:04.675 --> 58:08.886
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

58:08.971 --> 58:13.224
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

58:13.308 --> 58:17.603
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

58:17.688 --> 58:19.981
Ray! Ray! Ray!

58:20.065 --> 58:22.525
- Sheryl?
- Yeah. Hey.

58:22.609 --> 58:24.318
Oh, my gosh, is this your...

58:24.403 --> 58:25.737
- Are these your kids?
- This is Rachel.

58:25.821 --> 58:28.531
Hi, I'm Sheryl. How are you?
This is my daughter, Nora.

58:28.615 --> 58:31.033
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
- Hi.

58:31.118 --> 58:34.036
- This is my son, Robbie.
- Just like Dad.

58:48.927 --> 58:52.096
- It's good to see you as well.
- Trees are funny.

58:52.181 --> 58:56.601
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

58:57.728 --> 58:59.729
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

58:59.813 --> 59:02.774
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

59:03.358 --> 59:06.319
- We got sick people here. Let us on.
- Let us on, for Christ's sake.

59:40.187 --> 59:44.065
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

59:44.149 --> 59:47.276
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

59:47.361 --> 59:48.611
Cast off.

59:48.695 --> 59:51.656
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

01:00:17.391 --> 01:00:20.810
Stay close. Stay close.

01:00:20.894 --> 01:00:23.646
Everybody, stop. Everybody, stop.

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:27.066
- Wait, wait, wait. Just...
- Back up. Back up.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.317
- There's room.
- Just stay back.

01:00:28.402 --> 01:00:29.986
There's no more room.
There's no more room.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.654
Just listen to me. There's three of us.

01:00:31.738 --> 01:00:34.532
- Five. There's only five of us.
- There's no more room.

01:00:34.616 --> 01:00:35.992
Okay, man, just don't push me.

01:00:36.076 --> 01:00:38.327
- Sir, there's no more room.
- There is plenty of room.

01:00:38.412 --> 01:00:40.872
- There's room for hundreds more.
- Sir...

01:00:40.956 --> 01:00:42.081
- Everybody, wait.
- Hold on.

01:00:42.165 --> 01:00:43.541
- You just stay with me.
- Okay.

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:44.959
Grab my jacket.

01:00:45.043 --> 01:00:46.627
Everybody, back up.

01:00:46.712 --> 01:00:47.837
Back up.

01:00:47.921 --> 01:00:49.505
I got you, Ferrier.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:51.340
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

01:00:51.425 --> 01:00:52.466
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come.

01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:55.094
- Okay. Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Come on. Come on.

01:00:55.429 --> 01:00:57.096
Watch out.

01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:05.438
Come on.

01:01:06.106 --> 01:01:08.399
- Move. Move. Move.
- Ray.

01:01:08.483 --> 01:01:10.318
Ray!

01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:13.613
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Move it! Get out of here!

01:01:15.073 --> 01:01:17.241
Go. I can go with him.

01:01:17.326 --> 01:01:18.826
Sheryl?

01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:21.162
- Stay back.
- Go with them. Go.

01:01:21.246 --> 01:01:22.330
- Ray.
- Sheryl?

01:01:22.414 --> 01:01:24.165
- Everybody...
- Sheryl?

01:01:24.249 --> 01:01:27.043
- There's room on the boat.
- Let us through, God damn it.

01:01:27.127 --> 01:01:29.211
- There's still room on the boat.
- She's a child.

01:01:29.296 --> 01:01:31.005
- Robbie.
- There's room on the...

01:01:31.089 --> 01:01:33.299
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

01:01:33.383 --> 01:01:34.425
Up there!

01:01:39.473 --> 01:01:41.265
- Robbie.
- Just stay with me.

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.392
Stay with me, Robbie.

01:01:47.105 --> 01:01:48.648
Robbie!

01:02:13.423 --> 01:02:15.925
- Robbie. Robbie.
- Robbie.

01:02:16.009 --> 01:02:18.010
Robbie!

01:02:21.682 --> 01:02:23.933
- Robbie.
- Come on.

01:02:24.017 --> 01:02:26.435
Here. Grab my hand.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.396
Here. Hold on.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.773
I got you. Hold on.

01:02:30.857 --> 01:02:32.692
Take my hand.

01:02:32.776 --> 01:02:34.944
Take it. Take my hand.

01:02:35.028 --> 01:02:36.445
Here!

01:02:56.883 --> 01:02:59.385
Oh, my God.

01:03:18.238 --> 01:03:19.238
Robbie!

01:04:03.575 --> 01:04:05.534
Swim. Swim this way.

01:04:12.626 --> 01:04:15.419
- Robbie!
- Robbie!

01:04:59.005 --> 01:05:02.133
- Help me. Help me with her.
- Here, Rach.

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:07.513
Don't stop. Don't stop.

01:05:07.848 --> 01:05:09.515
Don't stop.

01:05:26.491 --> 01:05:28.450
Oh, my God.

01:06:31.306 --> 01:06:44.693
Robbie, slow down.

01:06:58.875 --> 01:07:01.752
- Robbie.
- We gotta stay together, Robbie.

01:07:03.838 --> 01:07:05.422
Robbie?

01:07:05.507 --> 01:07:07.007
Stay together.

01:07:07.092 --> 01:07:08.676
Robbie!

01:07:12.013 --> 01:07:14.181
Get back here!

01:07:18.687 --> 01:07:20.271
Robbie!

01:07:20.355 --> 01:07:23.524
No, Robbie! Come back!

01:07:31.324 --> 01:07:32.950
Robbie.

01:07:33.034 --> 01:07:34.994
Don't move. Don't move.

01:07:35.078 --> 01:07:37.997
Now, for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

01:07:38.081 --> 01:07:39.915
- Robbie!
- Stop those people.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.001
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Robbie.

01:07:43.128 --> 01:07:45.796
Robbie.

01:07:46.089 --> 01:07:47.214
What the hell?

01:07:47.299 --> 01:07:49.341
Why are you doing this?

01:07:52.804 --> 01:07:56.223
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

01:07:58.268 --> 01:08:00.394
Jekyll, no effect on target. No effect.

01:08:00.478 --> 01:08:01.937
Roger. No effect.

01:08:02.022 --> 01:08:04.732
Our mission, Lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

01:08:04.816 --> 01:08:08.152
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

01:08:09.863 --> 01:08:12.740
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

01:08:15.702 --> 01:08:16.952
Listen to me.

01:08:17.037 --> 01:08:18.495
Go back down the hill.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.872
All of you, just turn around.

01:08:33.053 --> 01:08:35.470
- Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
- I wanna be here.

01:08:35.555 --> 01:08:37.389
- I need to see this.
- I know it seems like you have to,

01:08:37.474 --> 01:08:40.559
- but you don't. You don't.
- Please, let me go.

01:08:40.643 --> 01:08:43.062
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:43.145 --> 01:08:45.147
What are you doing here all by yourself?

01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:46.732
Look, sweetie,
you gotta come with us, please.

01:08:46.816 --> 01:08:48.817
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

01:08:48.902 --> 01:08:50.109
- You can't stay here.
- We gotta go.

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:51.819
- I'm not gonna leave her alone.
- Leave.

01:08:51.904 --> 01:08:54.238
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

01:08:54.323 --> 01:08:56.200
- You can hate me. But I love you.
- Let me go. Please.

01:08:56.283 --> 01:08:58.035
- Let me go. Dad.
- I'm not letting you do this.

01:08:58.118 --> 01:09:00.746
I can't. No. Please. Please don't pull me.

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:03.332
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

01:09:03.416 --> 01:09:05.542
Please, let me stay here. Please.
I can't go with you.

01:09:05.627 --> 01:09:07.169
- My dad's right there.
- Please, come.

01:09:07.252 --> 01:09:09.171
- Please, my dad's right there.
- Will you just listen to me?

01:09:09.255 --> 01:09:12.049
I need to be here. I want to see this.

01:09:12.133 --> 01:09:14.635
Wait. Wait. Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

01:09:14.719 --> 01:09:18.263
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.935
All right. Okay. All right.
You're coming with us.

01:09:23.019 --> 01:09:24.185
- We gotta go! Now!
- Dad.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.188
- We're going now.
- No, no, you don't understand.

01:09:26.272 --> 01:09:36.073
Dad!

01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:44.206
Let me go! Dad!

01:09:46.126 --> 01:09:49.670
Guide on. Guide on. Black Six.
Attack. Attack. Attack.

01:09:51.923 --> 01:09:53.631
Stop.

01:09:53.716 --> 01:09:56.885
- That's my dad.
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:58.720
- We're so sorry.
- We thought she was alone.

01:09:58.805 --> 01:10:01.640
- She was standing by the tree...
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

01:10:05.812 --> 01:10:07.146
Robbie.

01:10:17.323 --> 01:10:19.783
Robbie!

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.303
Over here.

01:10:39.387 --> 01:10:40.846
Over here!

01:10:44.476 --> 01:10:46.185
Hurry.

01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:07.414
Are you all right?

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:09.208
Hey.

01:11:11.419 --> 01:11:13.212
What about you, huh?

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.894
There you go.

01:11:30.438 --> 01:11:32.439
Is that comfortable?

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.985
I need you to close your eyes
now, okay?

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:38.904
You need some sleep.

01:11:41.282 --> 01:11:42.783
Dad?

01:11:42.867 --> 01:11:44.576
He's gonna meet us.

01:11:45.787 --> 01:11:47.996
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

01:11:48.081 --> 01:11:50.541
In Boston, at your grandma's.

01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:53.794
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

01:11:53.878 --> 01:11:55.379
Mom?

01:11:56.714 --> 01:11:58.799
Boston. She's waiting.

01:11:59.217 --> 01:12:02.719
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

01:12:02.804 --> 01:12:06.181
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,
and she's...

01:12:07.934 --> 01:12:10.936
She's making that awful tea she makes.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.896
And they're all just...

01:12:13.565 --> 01:12:16.942
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

01:12:19.112 --> 01:12:22.072
What is this? What is this?

01:12:22.699 --> 01:12:25.367
- I won.
- You won?

01:12:25.451 --> 01:12:27.744
The walk, trot and canter.

01:12:27.912 --> 01:12:29.871
Third place.

01:12:38.131 --> 01:12:40.924
Sing me Lullaby and Goodnight.

01:12:44.971 --> 01:12:46.972
I don't know that one.

01:12:47.974 --> 01:12:50.058
Sing me Hushabye Mountain.

01:12:53.605 --> 01:12:57.065
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...
I don't know that one either.

01:13:18.171 --> 01:13:21.632
I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down

01:13:22.216 --> 01:13:25.385
'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town

01:13:25.553 --> 01:13:28.680
Something comes up to me
They don't even try

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:33.852
'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly

01:13:34.145 --> 01:13:36.688
She's my little deuce coupe

01:13:37.649 --> 01:13:40.025
You don't know what I got

01:13:41.194 --> 01:13:43.612
Just my little deuce coupe

01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:48.367
You don't know what I got

01:13:56.626 --> 01:13:58.377
Peach schnapps.

01:13:58.461 --> 01:14:02.047
Disgusting, I know it.
Found a whole case of this shit.

01:14:09.222 --> 01:14:10.931
Thank you.

01:14:16.062 --> 01:14:18.188
I'm sorry about your son.

01:14:18.272 --> 01:14:19.856
We got separated. He's...

01:14:19.941 --> 01:14:23.068
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

01:14:29.909 --> 01:14:31.076
Did you...

01:14:33.329 --> 01:14:35.580
Did you lose anybody?

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:39.418
All of them.

01:14:42.213 --> 01:14:44.756
Harlan Ogilvy.

01:14:45.717 --> 01:14:47.092
Ray Ferrier.

01:14:47.176 --> 01:14:48.844
I got water.

01:14:50.221 --> 01:14:52.431
Food enough for weeks.

01:14:53.266 --> 01:14:56.017
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

01:14:56.185 --> 01:14:57.894
I'm sorry.

01:14:58.938 --> 01:15:00.981
I'm gonna get some sleep.

01:15:02.734 --> 01:15:07.696
Those machines,
those Tripods they got,

01:15:09.782 --> 01:15:11.742
they buried them.

01:15:12.744 --> 01:15:14.536
Right under our feet.

01:15:15.955 --> 01:15:18.039
Since before there...

01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:20.625
There were even people here.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:24.296
They've been planning this
for a million years.

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:29.134
- We're beat to shit.
- Please.

01:15:29.218 --> 01:15:31.511
- My daughter...
- Think about it.

01:15:34.599 --> 01:15:38.101
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

01:15:38.186 --> 01:15:40.395
Walked right over us.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.690
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

01:15:44.859 --> 01:15:46.026
This is not a war

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:49.362
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

01:15:49.822 --> 01:15:51.823
This is an extermination.

01:16:02.502 --> 01:16:03.835
You afraid?

01:16:06.005 --> 01:16:07.798
Of course I am.

01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:12.594
I been around death plenty.

01:16:13.971 --> 01:16:15.680
I drive an ambulance in the city...

01:16:15.765 --> 01:16:18.225
Drove an ambulance in the city.

01:16:18.476 --> 01:16:20.560
That's all over now, huh?

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.817
You know the people that make it, Ray?

01:16:27.193 --> 01:16:30.612
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

01:16:33.032 --> 01:16:35.784
It's the ones that keep their eyes open.

01:16:36.619 --> 01:16:39.371
That keep looking at you. Keep thinking.

01:16:40.039 --> 01:16:42.457
They're the ones that survive.

01:16:43.918 --> 01:16:46.294
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

01:16:48.256 --> 01:16:49.548
Running.

01:16:50.258 --> 01:16:52.259
That's what'll kill you.

01:16:53.886 --> 01:16:56.555
And I'm dead set on living.

01:17:02.061 --> 01:17:04.187
Dead set on living...

01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:09.067
Thank you for taking us in.

01:17:16.284 --> 01:17:18.326
Not gonna be exterminated.

01:17:34.218 --> 01:17:37.345
It's okay. Come on.
I wanna show you something.

01:17:38.764 --> 01:17:41.683
We're gonna fight them, Ray.
They got to have a weakness.

01:17:41.767 --> 01:17:43.435
Come. Take a look.

01:17:51.444 --> 01:17:54.779
Somehow they killed a few of these
things in Osaka. That's what I heard.

01:17:54.864 --> 01:17:57.616
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.200
We can do this, Ray.

01:17:59.285 --> 01:18:01.161
We can do it. We can get them.

01:18:01.245 --> 01:18:03.121
We can figure it out.

01:18:03.623 --> 01:18:05.457
Stay right there.

01:18:24.894 --> 01:18:26.728
I have a daughter.

01:18:26.812 --> 01:18:28.229
Why did you bring us here?

01:18:28.314 --> 01:18:31.149
To fight them together, Ray.

01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:34.736
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

01:18:36.197 --> 01:18:38.281
When the time is right,

01:18:38.366 --> 01:18:41.576
take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

01:18:41.661 --> 01:18:43.912
Take them by surprise.

01:18:45.081 --> 01:18:46.539
We're right under their feet, Ray.

01:18:46.624 --> 01:18:49.501
Right here. Under their feet.

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:40.051
You miss your mommy?

01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:42.637
I had a little girl.

01:19:43.597 --> 01:19:45.056
Nearly your age.

01:19:46.225 --> 01:19:50.645
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy, I'll take care of you.

01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:51.938
Rachel.

01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:04.075
You don't have anything to say to her.
Do you understand?

01:20:04.744 --> 01:20:06.494
If you wanna talk to somebody,

01:20:06.579 --> 01:20:08.246
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:10.832
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

01:20:10.916 --> 01:20:13.835
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

01:20:13.919 --> 01:20:17.088
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

01:20:17.423 --> 01:20:19.257
Is that your plan?

01:20:20.926 --> 01:20:23.136
Maybe you want to get caught.

01:20:23.471 --> 01:20:27.015
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

01:20:27.099 --> 01:20:28.641
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

01:20:32.938 --> 01:20:34.272
Listen.

01:20:35.649 --> 01:20:38.485
- It stopped.
- Maybe you'll be okay.

01:20:38.569 --> 01:20:41.446
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:44.574
You know, feed you,
train you how to do tricks.

01:20:44.658 --> 01:20:46.659
Will you shut up and listen?

01:22:50.451 --> 01:22:51.826
No.

01:27:15.841 --> 01:27:17.633
Give me that.

01:28:51.144 --> 01:28:52.937
You and me,

01:28:54.147 --> 01:28:57.233
I don't think we're on the same page.

01:29:33.729 --> 01:29:36.355
Ray. Ray.

01:29:36.523 --> 01:29:39.275
Ray. Ray. Ray!

01:29:39.359 --> 01:29:40.901
Ray!

01:29:41.153 --> 01:29:44.071
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

01:30:25.489 --> 01:30:28.199
Not my blood. Not my blood.

01:30:31.161 --> 01:30:33.079
Not my blood.

01:30:34.039 --> 01:30:36.123
Not my...

01:30:36.458 --> 01:30:37.958
Not

01:30:39.044 --> 01:30:40.378
my...

01:30:42.589 --> 01:30:51.806
Not my blood.

01:30:51.973 --> 01:30:53.641
- Not my blood.
- Stop it.

01:30:53.725 --> 01:30:56.560
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

01:30:56.645 --> 01:30:58.270
You gotta be quiet.

01:30:58.355 --> 01:31:00.481
- You want them to hear you?
- They drink us.

01:31:00.565 --> 01:31:02.483
- Please, they'll hear you.
- They drink us.

01:31:02.567 --> 01:31:05.653
Then they spray us, like fertilizer.

01:31:05.737 --> 01:31:06.987
You gotta be quiet.

01:31:07.072 --> 01:31:09.907
- Drink us, and...
- They're gonna come back down here.

01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:13.160
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

01:31:13.245 --> 01:31:15.079
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

01:31:15.205 --> 01:31:17.164
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

01:31:17.249 --> 01:31:19.291
This tunnel will get us to the city.

01:31:19.376 --> 01:31:21.043
We'll have our own tunnels there.
Ready-made.

01:31:21.128 --> 01:31:22.586
- Stop it.
- Subway. See what I'm saying?

01:31:22.671 --> 01:31:24.171
- We can hide a whole army down there.
- Stop it.

01:31:24.256 --> 01:31:26.006
We'll go underground.
Sneak attacks at night.

01:31:26.091 --> 01:31:29.510
Stop. Stop. You stop it!

01:31:29.594 --> 01:31:32.847
We're the resistance, Ray.
They can't occupy this country.

01:31:32.931 --> 01:31:34.390
Occupations always fail.

01:31:34.474 --> 01:31:36.642
History's taught us that
a thousand times.

01:31:36.727 --> 01:31:38.936
This is our land.

01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:42.481
We eat it, we breathe it,
only we can live on it.

01:31:42.566 --> 01:31:45.359
They can't survive here, Ray.
They weren't built for it.

01:31:46.111 --> 01:31:49.238
- They're gonna kill you, brother, not me!
- What are you doing?

01:31:49.322 --> 01:31:51.240
- Not my blood!
- What are you doing, Dad?

01:31:51.324 --> 01:31:54.535
Whatever you hear, don't take this off.

01:31:54.619 --> 01:31:56.287
- Dad?
- Rach?

01:31:56.371 --> 01:31:58.831
- Dad?
- What was that song?

01:31:58.915 --> 01:32:02.543
- That lullaby that I didn't know?
- Not my blood!

01:32:02.627 --> 01:32:04.712
- Hushabye Mountain?
- Yeah, sing it.

01:32:04.796 --> 01:32:07.548
- They can take you!
- Please, Rach, sing it.

01:32:07.632 --> 01:32:09.049
They can take you!

01:32:09.134 --> 01:32:10.634
A gentle breeze

01:32:10.719 --> 01:32:13.345
- Your daughter! Not me!
- Don't stop.

01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:15.347
On Hushabye Mountain

01:32:15.432 --> 01:32:16.891
- They're gonna kill you!
- That's my girl.

01:32:16.975 --> 01:32:21.645
Softly blows over Lullaby Bay

01:32:22.606 --> 01:32:23.856
Forget it! Tunnel!

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:26.942
It fills the sails

01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:30.237
Of boats that are waiting

01:32:31.907 --> 01:32:36.827
waiting to sail your worries away

01:32:38.538 --> 01:32:42.124
So close your eyes

01:32:42.793 --> 01:32:46.420
On Hushabye Mountain

01:32:46.505 --> 01:32:51.342
wave goodbye to cares of the day

01:32:52.052 --> 01:32:57.264
And watch your boat
from Hushabye Mountain

01:32:57.766 --> 01:33:03.521
Sail far away
from Lullaby Bay

01:34:55.926 --> 01:34:59.637
Rachel?

01:35:00.305 --> 01:35:02.264
Oh, my God, no.

01:35:04.017 --> 01:35:08.979
Rachel? Rachel?

01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:22.826
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

01:35:22.994 --> 01:35:27.665
Rachel?

01:35:32.087 --> 01:35:34.838
Rachel? Just talk to me, baby. Come on.

01:35:38.593 --> 01:35:45.432
Rachel?

01:35:59.072 --> 01:36:03.033
Rachel!

01:37:09.809 --> 01:37:12.686
No, no, no! No!

01:37:44.219 --> 01:37:46.261
Hey!

01:38:25.176 --> 01:38:27.261
Help!

01:38:29.389 --> 01:38:32.266
What is happening?

01:38:34.727 --> 01:38:35.853
Rachel!

01:39:07.719 --> 01:39:09.636
Rachel.

01:39:09.721 --> 01:39:12.347
Rachel. Rachel.

01:39:13.349 --> 01:39:21.148
Rachel.

01:39:22.025 --> 01:39:23.233
Dad.

01:39:50.386 --> 01:39:53.305
No! No!

01:39:53.389 --> 01:39:55.974
- Pull me! Pull me!
- No!

01:40:02.482 --> 01:40:05.192
Pull! Pull!

01:40:05.276 --> 01:40:07.903
- Pull me.
- Come on, pull!

01:40:11.032 --> 01:40:13.450
- Dad!
- One, two, three...

01:40:13.534 --> 01:40:15.244
- We got him!
- We got you.

01:40:15.328 --> 01:40:16.912
Keep pulling!

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:27.047
Everybody down!

01:41:19.309 --> 01:41:21.184
Keep it moving, folks.

01:41:23.771 --> 01:41:26.189
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

01:41:26.524 --> 01:41:29.067
- Oh, God.
- I don't know what's going on.

01:41:30.862 --> 01:41:32.821
Hold Grandma's hand.

01:41:34.949 --> 01:41:38.410
Let's go, folks. Keep moving forward.

01:41:48.504 --> 01:41:50.297
Put that down.

01:41:52.759 --> 01:41:55.635
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way. Thank you.

01:42:03.811 --> 01:42:06.772
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.026
What happened to it?

01:42:14.906 --> 01:42:16.490
It's dying.

01:42:18.951 --> 01:42:20.660
Keep moving forward.

01:42:31.381 --> 01:42:32.923
Keep moving. It's all right.

01:42:33.007 --> 01:42:34.591
You can pass on through. Move along.

01:42:34.675 --> 01:42:35.759
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

01:42:35.843 --> 01:42:37.844
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

01:42:37.929 --> 01:42:39.471
- Let's go, move out.
- Let's go, people.

01:42:39.972 --> 01:42:43.100
- Something's happening to them.
- Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

01:42:43.226 --> 01:42:44.267
Let's go, sir. Let's go.

01:42:44.352 --> 01:42:45.811
Do not stop. Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:42:45.895 --> 01:42:47.229
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's happened here?

01:42:47.313 --> 01:42:49.856
- Did you guys take it down?
- No, sir, it was behaving erratically,

01:42:49.941 --> 01:42:52.651
walking in circles, then it went down
on its own about an hour ago.

01:42:52.735 --> 01:42:55.862
Now, please, let's go. Let's go.
Keep moving. Come on. Don't stop.

01:42:55.947 --> 01:42:58.031
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

01:42:59.534 --> 01:43:01.451
How is it dead all by itself?

01:43:01.619 --> 01:43:04.246
- Rachel, I'm not sure.
- Coming through.

01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:07.416
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

01:43:27.478 --> 01:43:29.354
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

01:43:29.439 --> 01:43:31.022
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down.

01:43:31.107 --> 01:43:32.983
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

01:43:44.829 --> 01:43:47.998
Everybody, calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

01:43:48.082 --> 01:43:51.001
Everybody, on the other side
of the tracks!

01:43:54.505 --> 01:43:55.797
Look at the birds!

01:43:55.882 --> 01:43:57.424
I can't hear you!

01:43:57.508 --> 01:44:00.343
Look at the goddamn birds!

01:44:03.347 --> 01:44:05.557
- No shield!
- I can't hear!

01:44:05.641 --> 01:44:07.476
No shield!

01:44:11.481 --> 01:44:13.857
The Javelin's the key!

01:44:13.941 --> 01:44:16.735
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

01:44:16.903 --> 01:44:18.445
Let's go!

01:44:20.281 --> 01:44:21.448
It's safer in here.

01:44:21.532 --> 01:44:23.492
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:44:23.576 --> 01:44:25.202
Bring out the Javelin!

01:44:34.003 --> 01:44:36.338
Clear! Go from behind! Clear!

01:44:45.389 --> 01:44:47.974
- Let me know when you're tracking!
- Tracking!

01:44:48.059 --> 01:44:49.601
- You got a lock?
- I got a lock!

01:44:49.685 --> 01:44:51.394
Fire the Javelin!

01:44:58.110 --> 01:45:00.487
- I got a lock!
- Fire the Javelin!

01:45:03.658 --> 01:45:05.116
Fire!

01:45:19.715 --> 01:45:21.508
It's okay.

01:45:22.677 --> 01:45:24.594
I love you.

01:45:24.762 --> 01:45:27.097
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
- Let's go!

01:45:28.599 --> 01:45:31.017
Keep those civilians out of there.

01:45:31.102 --> 01:45:34.938
Back. Stay back!
Come on, folks, back up!

01:45:39.777 --> 01:45:43.196
Come on, guys, get on the line.
Get up there now.

01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:46.199
- Stay back. Stay right here, huh?
- Hold on right there.

01:45:52.456 --> 01:45:55.250
- It's opening.
- It's opening. Keep them back.

01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.124
Clear!

01:46:36.208 --> 01:46:39.628
No, keep them back. Keep them back.
Come on, stay back.

01:47:15.206 --> 01:47:16.706
Mom!

01:47:43.943 --> 01:47:45.860
Thank you.

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.010
- Robbie?
- Robbie?

01:48:17.518 --> 01:48:24.190
Hi, Dad.

01:48:58.517 --> 01:49:00.894
From the moment the invaders arrived,

01:49:00.978 --> 01:49:04.564
breathed our air, ate and drank,

01:49:04.648 --> 01:49:06.316
they were doomed.

01:49:07.359 --> 01:49:10.570
They were undone, destroyed,

01:49:10.654 --> 01:49:13.948
after all of man's weapons
and devices had faijled,

01:49:14.241 --> 01:49:19.245
by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.

01:49:20.247 --> 01:49:24.042
By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,

01:49:24.126 --> 01:49:28.713
his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.

01:49:29.799 --> 01:49:33.510
And that right is ours
against all challenges,

01:49:33.844 --> 01:56:05.735
for neither do men jlive, nor die, in vain.
