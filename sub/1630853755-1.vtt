VAN WIRT:
Dolls have been around
since the Egyptians.

00:57.391 --> 01:01.561
They even found one
in King Tut's tomb.

01:05.699 --> 01:09.603
He wouldn't part with it,
even in the afterlife.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.480
But what is a doll, really?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.917
Nothing more than mankind's
attempt to finish

01:24.017 --> 01:26.353
what the Almighty began.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.189
Forgive me if that's
a tad blasphemous.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.158
What I'm trying to say is...

01:31.258 --> 01:35.061
when the Lord formed dust
into man,

01:35.161 --> 01:38.598
he was seeking perfection.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.035
Isn't that so?

01:41.135 --> 01:43.703
That is what I was told
in Sunday school.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.973
Well, a doll does not sin.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.809
It has no flesh to mortify.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.343
No soul to lose.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.614
It's God's ideal made manifest.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.316
So, God would love us more
if we were made out of plastic?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.153
Not that you don't have
a point, sir.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.956
Don't do that.
Don't retreat from your point.

02:03.056 --> 02:07.361
I like people
who think for themselves.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.229
Well, that has never been
a problem of mine,

02:09.329 --> 02:11.331

The truth is,
I've never interviewed

02:25.079 --> 02:27.648
a candidate more qualified.

02:27.748 --> 02:31.318
Well, I just would like to add
that my academic achievements

02:31.418 --> 02:34.354
are nothing
compared to my tenacity.

02:34.454 --> 02:35.889
I know times are tough,

14:54.280 --> 14:56.582
And what if you do win?

14:56.682 --> 14:58.517
What happens then?

14:58.617 --> 15:00.052
Being the kid's mom?
What does that mean?

15:00.153 --> 15:02.588
Does anyone know
what that means?

15:03.956 --> 15:07.126
Does being the kid's mom
mean being Van Wirt's wife?

15:07.226 --> 15:10.596
Well, whatever it means,
when I win,

15:10.697 --> 15:12.798
I got time to figure a way out.

15:14.567 --> 15:17.003
You can't clean the muck bucket
if you're dead.

15:17.103 --> 15:18.304
(bell clanging)

15:18.404 --> 15:19.705
What's that?

15:19.805 --> 15:21.207
At this hour,
it'll be one thing.

15:21.307 --> 15:22.775
A test.

15:22.875 --> 15:26.345
We don't just have to play
with the kid, now, dolly.

15:27.212 --> 15:29.448
The shit that starts now

15:29.549 --> 15:31.684
is the shit that really counts.

15:32.752 --> 15:34.353
VAN WIRT:
This evening, we will focus

15:34.453 --> 15:35.955
on the "déjeuner
a la fourchette,"

15:36.055 --> 15:39.592
or "le lunch," as they call it
in the Quarter.

15:39.692 --> 15:42.661
There is a formality
to be observed,

15:42.762 --> 15:46.332
no less important
than in the evening repast.

15:46.432 --> 15:50.169
Here are the building blocks

15:50.269 --> 15:54.106
for our culinary ballet.

15:57.977 --> 16:01.013
Salad fork, meat fork,
bouillon spoon,

16:01.113 --> 16:05.417
water glass, Apollinaris,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

16:05.517 --> 16:08.421
The hypothetical menu
for our afternoon

16:08.521 --> 16:12.124
is crawfish cardinal,

16:12.224 --> 16:14.360
terrapin soup,

16:14.460 --> 16:17.229
stuffed drum,

16:17.329 --> 16:20.333
as well as assorted ices

16:20.433 --> 16:22.701
and pies.

16:22.801 --> 16:27.039
As always, you will be graded
according to precision.

16:27.139 --> 16:30.376
Deviations will result
in one point awarded.

16:30.476 --> 16:32.978
The one with the most points
at the end

16:33.078 --> 16:34.913
will be discarded.

16:35.013 --> 16:36.248
(clock tolls)

16:36.348 --> 16:39.185
You have one minute

16:39.285 --> 16:42.855
to set the table for lunch.

16:44.624 --> 16:45.724
-(clock clicks)
-Begin.

16:45.824 --> 16:49.461
(orchestral music playing)

17:03.943 --> 17:05.944
30 seconds.

17:12.218 --> 17:13.852
15 seconds.

17:21.994 --> 17:23.695
Five seconds.

17:27.499 --> 17:29.001
-Freeze.
-(alarm rings)

17:29.102 --> 17:30.402
All right.

17:30.502 --> 17:32.938
Let's see what we have.

17:33.739 --> 17:35.908
Knife facing toward the plate.

17:37.443 --> 17:39.578
Fruit spoon in the proper place.

17:41.213 --> 17:43.115
Apollinaris glass correct.

17:43.215 --> 17:44.950
Perfect score.

17:47.219 --> 17:50.055
Tragic napkin fold.

17:51.089 --> 17:54.860
Salad and meat fork
in the wrong place.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.929
Two points.

17:58.797 --> 18:01.667
Knife should be facing
toward the plate, not away.

18:01.767 --> 18:05.504
Salted nut bowl
is in the wrong place.

18:09.442 --> 18:13.279
You used a bouillon spoon
for terrapin soup

18:13.379 --> 18:15.815
instead of the terrapin fork.

18:15.915 --> 18:18.251
And that water glass calamity
warrants three points.

18:18.351 --> 18:21.053
Total: four.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.729
I'm surprised at you.

18:32.031 --> 18:35.000
This isn't fit
for my worst coonhound.

18:36.468 --> 18:38.337
Napkins,

18:38.437 --> 18:42.541
hemstitched or scalloped,
folded in tri-shape,

18:42.641 --> 18:44.310
long edge toward the fork,

18:44.410 --> 18:47.079
water glass at the tip
of the knife,

18:47.179 --> 18:48.914
Apollinaris glass
upon the same doily

18:49.014 --> 18:52.251
to the right and just down
from the water glass.

18:52.351 --> 18:54.253
Too many infractions to count!

18:54.353 --> 18:55.888
Let's not prolong this.

18:55.988 --> 18:57.356
No, please.

18:57.456 --> 18:58.824
I wasn't taught any of this.

18:58.925 --> 19:00.493
My parents worked in a cannery.
It's not fair.

19:00.593 --> 19:02.361
Please, I don't want to die.

19:02.461 --> 19:04.596
(screams)

19:07.500 --> 19:10.536
(Faye grunting)

19:14.640 --> 19:16.075
(lock clicking)

19:16.175 --> 19:17.910
(door opens)

19:18.911 --> 19:20.813
(Faye screaming)

19:20.913 --> 19:23.115
(door closes)

19:30.122 --> 19:31.357
BONNIE:
What the hell's a terrapin?

19:31.457 --> 19:32.858
AURELIA:
It's a turtle, you idiot.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.927
COBY:
I can't believe
this is happening.

19:35.027 --> 19:37.229
-HARLENE: Poor Faye.
-AURELIA: Fuck her.

19:37.329 --> 19:38.397
One more out of the way.

19:38.497 --> 19:40.132
(screams)

19:40.232 --> 19:42.367
-That kid ain't gonna save you.
-(water splashes)

19:42.467 --> 19:46.905
Nothing is gonna save you.

19:50.309 --> 19:52.077
(metal squeaking)

20:03.122 --> 20:06.559
That wasn't really just
a magic trick you did, was it?

20:06.659 --> 20:08.027
COBY:
Do you want to hear a secret?

20:08.127 --> 20:10.062
It's a gift.

20:10.162 --> 20:12.598
Something I was born with.

20:22.341 --> 20:24.810
(high-pitched ringing)

20:27.412 --> 20:29.682
Something I've been able
to do since, well,

20:29.782 --> 20:31.683
since I stopped
being a little girl.

20:31.783 --> 20:32.951
OTIS:
Well, what else can you do?

20:33.051 --> 20:34.987
Well, I haven't tried
to find out.

20:35.087 --> 20:37.689
I've been afraid of what
would happen if my family knew.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.391
OTIS:
What would happen?

20:39.491 --> 20:41.594
COBY:
They could decide I had
a demon or something,

20:41.694 --> 20:43.629
have a preacher yell over me.

20:43.729 --> 20:46.064
The place where I came from,
there were a lot of rules

20:46.164 --> 20:48.501
about what was right
and what was wrong,

20:48.601 --> 20:50.302
and how to live
and how not to live.

20:50.402 --> 20:53.205
That's why I decided
to leave home.

20:53.305 --> 20:55.074
I wanted to be free.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.511
I guess we both know what
it feels like to be different.

20:58.611 --> 20:59.678
I'm not different.

20:59.778 --> 21:01.647
You don't go to school,

21:01.748 --> 21:04.149
and you're a boy who likes
to play with dolls.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.318
What do you have against dolls?

21:06.418 --> 21:07.719
Nothing.

21:07.819 --> 21:10.623
I'm just saying it's not
like other people,

21:10.723 --> 21:13.659
and around here
that can be hard.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.529
I used to go to school,
until kids beat me up.

21:17.629 --> 21:20.566
The teachers said I was
odd and belligerent.

21:20.666 --> 21:22.601
Now I don't go anymore.

21:22.701 --> 21:25.704
Don't you miss them?
Your mom and dad?

21:25.805 --> 21:29.975
COBY:
I miss when my mom
used to sing me to sleep.

21:33.779 --> 21:35.547
You miss your mom, don't you?

21:39.117 --> 21:41.587
Can I tell you a secret?

21:43.656 --> 21:47.092
I hope you win
and get to be my mom.

21:49.595 --> 21:51.363
COBY:
That'd be nice.

21:52.998 --> 21:55.935
But I wouldn't be
a good mom if I was sad.

21:56.035 --> 21:58.270
Why would you be sad?

21:58.370 --> 22:00.606
COBY:
Because of all the dolls we'd
have to throw down the well.

22:00.706 --> 22:02.341
I throw out old dolls
all the time.

22:02.442 --> 22:06.612
COBY:
But they're not just dolls,
they're my friends.

22:06.712 --> 22:10.182
If you tell your daddy to stop
this and let everyone go,

22:10.282 --> 22:14.753
I promise you, I'll be the best
mommy you'll ever want.

22:14.854 --> 22:18.524
I cross my heart
and hope to die.

22:27.032 --> 22:29.735
-(clock tolls)
-VAN WIRT: No,
we just need more time.

22:29.835 --> 22:32.137
The public will come around.

22:32.238 --> 22:37.009
Our new line of dolls
is better than anything

22:37.109 --> 22:41.580
that-that M-Mattel
or, uh, Hasbro ha...

22:41.680 --> 22:45.284
So what if they have Barbie?!

22:45.384 --> 22:48.020
We use old-world methods.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.955
Our dolls are hand-sewn.

22:50.055 --> 22:52.692
We just need more time
for people to find us.

22:52.792 --> 22:55.294
And then the sales will pick up.

22:55.394 --> 22:58.297
(grunts, shouts)

22:58.397 --> 23:00.500
What are you doing out of bed?

23:00.600 --> 23:02.234
Did I wake you?

23:02.334 --> 23:05.037
Uh, I wanted
to ask you something.

23:05.137 --> 23:07.040
Oh.

23:07.140 --> 23:08.874
Come over here.

23:12.277 --> 23:13.679
(grunts)

23:15.981 --> 23:17.950
Are you in trouble, Dad?

23:18.984 --> 23:23.989
Life... sometimes...

23:24.089 --> 23:25.791
gives us challenges.

23:25.892 --> 23:29.996
And our jobs as good Christians

23:30.096 --> 23:35.434
is to meet those challenges
head-on.

23:37.436 --> 23:41.807
When we lost
your blessed mother,

23:41.907 --> 23:46.512
I decided that
the only possible replacement

23:46.612 --> 23:48.747
would be someone perfect.

23:48.847 --> 23:54.019
Daddy's gonna find you
the best mommy in the world.

23:54.119 --> 23:56.655
The perfect mommy

23:56.755 --> 24:00.626
who will always be
there for you.

24:03.295 --> 24:05.797
And you trust me?

24:06.966 --> 24:08.000
Right?

24:08.100 --> 24:10.403
-Yes, Daddy.
-Good.

24:10.503 --> 24:12.671
Now...

24:14.307 --> 24:16.542
...what did you want to ask me?

24:19.077 --> 24:20.812
Nothing.

24:45.471 --> 24:47.373
(clock ticking)

24:47.473 --> 24:49.541
(bell clanging)

24:56.081 --> 24:57.984
(lock clicks)

24:58.084 --> 24:59.451
(door creaking)

25:05.458 --> 25:07.893
Today you're going to impress me

25:07.993 --> 25:12.164
with what some of you might
consider a household chore.

25:12.264 --> 25:16.068
But like many things in life,
if done properly,

25:16.168 --> 25:22.074
even the most mundane task
can rise to the level of art.

25:24.810 --> 25:27.680
The proper ironing
and folding of a shirt,

25:27.780 --> 25:31.417
following the rules as set down
by Monsieur Seydoux

25:31.517 --> 25:36.021
in his famous
Dauphine Street Laundry.

25:37.723 --> 25:40.492
As we all know,
Seydoux placed great importance

25:40.592 --> 25:44.497
on the ingredients
for his ironing spray.

25:44.597 --> 25:47.266
And it was Seydoux

25:47.366 --> 25:50.303
who used Courvoisier

25:50.403 --> 25:53.306
instead of raw alcohol
in his sprays,

25:53.406 --> 25:57.376
as well as assorted herbs...

25:58.944 --> 26:01.847
...which gave his work
its distinctive aroma.

26:01.947 --> 26:04.883
(sniffs)
Mmm.

26:06.152 --> 26:09.388
You will have three minutes

26:09.488 --> 26:11.891
to make your solutions,

26:11.991 --> 26:17.896
and then to iron
and fold your shirts.

26:20.165 --> 26:21.667
-(clock ticking)
-Ticktock.

26:22.835 --> 26:24.403
The proper mixing
and application

26:24.503 --> 26:26.572
of your solution
is all that stands

26:26.672 --> 26:28.708
between triumph and disaster.

26:28.808 --> 26:31.910
Remember, we are making folds...

26:33.045 --> 26:34.413
...not creases.

26:34.513 --> 26:38.684
Folds that are crisp
prevent wrinkles.

26:41.186 --> 26:42.421
The fabric and the weave

26:42.521 --> 26:44.756
dictate the proper technique.

26:49.561 --> 26:51.563
(alarm rings)

26:58.737 --> 27:00.906
(sniffs)
Hmm. Too much lavender.

27:01.006 --> 27:03.876
(sniffs)
Not enough Courvoisier.

27:03.976 --> 27:05.477
Three.

27:10.649 --> 27:12.985
Mm. Too much starch.

27:13.085 --> 27:15.454
This shirt could get up
and walk out on its own.

27:15.555 --> 27:19.625
And, oh.
I can't believe my eyes.

27:23.295 --> 27:25.464
That looks like scorching.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.903
I expected more from you.

27:31.003 --> 27:35.974
Put your left hand on
the board and do not move it.

27:44.984 --> 27:47.019
(Coby grunting)

27:49.988 --> 27:51.757
Remember the lesson.

27:56.395 --> 27:58.330
(sniffs)

28:01.133 --> 28:02.534
Hmm.

28:09.876 --> 28:13.546
I said folds, not creases. Ugh.

28:13.646 --> 28:15.348
Not enough starch.

28:15.448 --> 28:17.483
(sniffs)
Oof.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.885
Smells like a whorehouse.

28:20.887 --> 28:22.855
-Four.
-BONNIE: No, no...

28:24.457 --> 28:27.092
-(screaming)
-(stabbing)

28:30.329 --> 28:32.564
(heart beating)

28:41.074 --> 28:45.244
Tomorrow marks the end
of our journey together

28:45.344 --> 28:46.679
and the final test.

28:46.779 --> 28:50.249
Whoever excels will
be given a great honor,

28:50.349 --> 28:52.384
and the others,

28:52.484 --> 28:55.254
well...

28:55.354 --> 28:58.724
Any one of you could win,

28:58.824 --> 29:02.094
so I suggest you all get
a good night's sleep.

29:04.597 --> 29:06.832
(lock clicks, door opens)

29:09.869 --> 29:12.604
-(door closes)
-HARLENE: What are we gonna do?

29:14.540 --> 29:15.908
I don't want to die.

29:16.742 --> 29:18.310
AURELIA:
Looks like your little magic

29:18.410 --> 29:22.581
and sweet talk didn't do shit.

29:35.061 --> 29:36.562
HARLENE:
I say we jump them.

29:36.662 --> 29:38.630
When they come in,
we make weapons and we hit them.

29:38.730 --> 29:40.332
They can't shoot us all.

29:40.432 --> 29:42.501
COBY:
Probably should have done
that when there were more of us.

29:42.601 --> 29:44.436
It's better than just
lying down.

29:44.536 --> 29:46.805
Like you said,
we got to do something.

29:46.905 --> 29:49.075
I really thought
I'd gotten to him.

29:49.175 --> 29:50.909
Little shit.

29:51.009 --> 29:52.545
If I get picked as his mother,
first chance I get,

29:52.645 --> 29:55.481
I'm gonna strangle him.

29:55.581 --> 29:57.483
I feel sorry for him.

29:57.583 --> 29:59.485
HARLENE:
I think Van Wirt likes you.

29:59.585 --> 30:01.220
COBY:
He just ironed my hand.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.688
You burned one of his shirts.

30:02.789 --> 30:04.523
He could've put you in the well
just for that.

30:04.623 --> 30:07.593
I think Van Wirt knows
his kid likes you.

30:07.693 --> 30:09.928
By the way, how'd you make
that truck move?

30:18.370 --> 30:19.771
What are you doing?

30:34.387 --> 30:37.356
♪♪ ♪♪

31:03.249 --> 31:05.450
♪♪ ♪♪

31:33.478 --> 31:35.514
Aurelia?

31:37.182 --> 31:39.451
-Are you crazy?
-I know that Van Wirt

31:39.551 --> 31:41.554
wants this bitch to win,

31:41.654 --> 31:44.823
and I am not gonna die tomorrow.

31:44.923 --> 31:47.926
None of us have
to die tomorrow, Aurelia.

31:48.026 --> 31:49.662
Mm-hmm? How's that?

31:49.762 --> 31:51.430
Just gonna magic us out of here?

31:51.530 --> 31:53.732
No, we're going to walk out
the front door.

31:55.134 --> 31:57.870
This estate runs ten miles
in every direction.

31:57.970 --> 31:59.772
We'd never get clear
before they hunt us down.

31:59.872 --> 32:02.240
Well, they won't know.
At least not at first.

32:02.341 --> 32:04.310
Enough to give us a head start.

32:04.410 --> 32:06.646
What head start?

32:06.746 --> 32:11.416
Well, he loves dolls,
so we're gonna give him dolls.

32:25.098 --> 32:27.332
(bell clanging)

32:38.878 --> 32:40.913
(clanging stops)

32:44.950 --> 32:46.051
(door closes)

32:46.151 --> 32:48.654
(lock clicks)

32:54.026 --> 32:55.661
(fingers snap)

33:01.200 --> 33:04.370
VAN WIRT:
This is the final test,
and the most important.

33:04.470 --> 33:07.039
Today we find out
who you really are.

33:07.139 --> 33:10.142
Knowing which fork to use

33:10.242 --> 33:14.547
doesn't matter
if your soul is in jeopardy.

33:14.647 --> 33:17.382
That is some voodoo shit.

33:21.354 --> 33:23.889
(Harlene whimpering softly)

33:23.989 --> 33:26.425
AURELIA:
I think there's
a road over there.

33:26.525 --> 33:28.661
Past the swamp. Come on.

33:28.761 --> 33:30.462
Wait. We-we can't go yet.

33:30.563 --> 33:34.066
My son will only keep company
with the saved.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.068
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Coby?

33:36.168 --> 33:37.870
-Huh?
-We can't leave that little boy
here with that man.

33:37.970 --> 33:39.472
We have to go get him and we
have to bring him with us.

33:39.572 --> 33:43.241
"The carpenter
stretcheth out his rule,

33:43.342 --> 33:44.811
he marketh it out with a line."

33:44.911 --> 33:47.045
When we get clear, we can tell
the police everything.

33:47.146 --> 33:48.815
-They'll take the kid
out of here.
-COBY: We don't know

33:48.915 --> 33:50.616
what Van Wirt would do
when he finds out we're gone.

33:50.716 --> 33:51.951
He could disappear
and he could take Otis.

33:52.051 --> 33:53.252
I'm not leaving him here.

33:53.352 --> 33:55.687
VAN WIRT:
"He fitteth it with planes

33:55.787 --> 33:59.491
and he marketh it out
with the compass."

33:59.591 --> 34:01.693
I hope you're ready
to be a mama.

34:03.462 --> 34:05.097
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm too scared.

34:05.198 --> 34:10.336
VAN WIRT:
"And he maketh it after
the figure of a man,

34:10.436 --> 34:14.607
"according to the beauty
of a man,

34:14.707 --> 34:20.913
so that it may remain
in the house."

34:23.149 --> 34:30.055
Which of the Old Testament
prophets said that?

34:43.202 --> 34:45.103
(creaking)

34:55.514 --> 34:57.716
(clock tolls)

35:09.562 --> 35:10.996
(whimpering)

35:11.096 --> 35:14.099
Wait. Wait for me!

35:24.509 --> 35:26.111
(whispers):
Otis.

35:26.879 --> 35:29.748
-Otis.
-Who are you?

35:29.848 --> 35:32.584
-I'm Coby.
-What are you doing here?

35:32.684 --> 35:34.253
I'm running away
and I want you to leave with me.

35:34.353 --> 35:36.722
-Run?
-Your daddy isn't well.

35:36.822 --> 35:39.925
Otis, he's done some things
that are very wrong.

35:40.025 --> 35:42.227
-Where are the other dolls?
-They ran away, too.

35:42.327 --> 35:45.097
But I-I couldn't leave
without you.

35:48.634 --> 35:50.569
Come with me.

35:54.407 --> 35:56.375
I'm sorry.

35:59.812 --> 36:01.079
HARLENE:
Wait for me!

36:01.180 --> 36:03.382
(wheezing)

36:05.851 --> 36:07.286
Aurelia.

36:07.386 --> 36:09.888
Don't leave me.

36:09.989 --> 36:11.290
Thank you.

36:11.390 --> 36:14.994
Too slow and too fucking loud.

36:15.094 --> 36:16.728
(gun cocks)

36:17.396 --> 36:18.530
(gasps)

36:23.803 --> 36:25.404
-(crying)
-(gunshot)

36:27.205 --> 36:29.475
VAN WIRT:
Congratulations, Miss Dellum.

36:30.609 --> 36:33.579
You're going to make
a wonderful mother for my son.

36:35.414 --> 36:36.682
(panting):
No.

36:36.782 --> 36:38.417
You know, not a lot happens
on my estate

36:38.517 --> 36:40.319
that I don't know about.

36:40.419 --> 36:42.221
The thing with these
vintage dolls

36:42.321 --> 36:47.460
is that their porcelain heads
make wonderful sound conductors.

36:47.560 --> 36:50.296
Now, I wasn't able
to hear everything

36:50.396 --> 36:52.564
about your plans,
but I heard enough.

36:52.664 --> 36:56.068
And so, I decided
that your escape attempt

36:56.168 --> 36:57.936
would be the final test,

36:58.036 --> 37:00.139
and only you passed.

37:00.239 --> 37:06.111
Only you cared enough about
my son to come back for him,

37:06.211 --> 37:07.446
at the risk of your own life.

37:07.546 --> 37:10.515
I'm, I'm deeply moved,
Miss Dellum.

37:10.616 --> 37:12.351
What are you going to do to me?

37:12.451 --> 37:14.720
I'm gonna make you perfect.

37:16.088 --> 37:17.957
Come, come.

37:18.057 --> 37:23.529
It may be a tad unsettling,
but it should be painless.

37:23.629 --> 37:28.033
I designed it that way,
just for you.

37:28.133 --> 37:30.370
-(whirring)
-(shouts)

37:30.470 --> 37:32.305
Please, please.

37:32.405 --> 37:33.606
(gasping)

37:33.706 --> 37:36.108
(screams)
Please!

37:36.208 --> 37:38.144
Please! Please help!

37:38.244 --> 37:39.912
Help!

37:40.012 --> 37:42.714
(screaming)

37:59.264 --> 38:01.400
Ah.

38:01.501 --> 38:05.070
This is lovely, isn't it, Otis?

38:06.071 --> 38:07.273
I wish she talked more.

38:07.373 --> 38:09.508
Well, we need
to give her some time.

38:09.608 --> 38:12.878
She's had quite
the stressful adjustment.

38:12.978 --> 38:15.081
I know that it was a bit awkward
the first week,

38:15.181 --> 38:17.650
but I can see that you're
getting the hang of it.

38:17.750 --> 38:20.619
I'm very proud of you, Coby.

38:20.719 --> 38:23.488
But we must look
for a better name.

38:23.589 --> 38:25.958
Coby Rae doesn't
seem quite right

38:26.058 --> 38:31.196
for such an elegant and refined
article like yourself.

38:31.296 --> 38:35.167
I must give that some thought.

38:35.267 --> 38:41.006
Nothing like afternoon tea
to still the soul.

38:43.910 --> 38:45.811
WITCH:
Soul? You shouldn't use words

38:45.912 --> 38:47.546
you don't understand, Van Wirt.

38:47.646 --> 38:51.016
Who are you?
How did you get into my house?

38:51.116 --> 38:52.985
Eustace.

38:53.085 --> 38:54.486
Eustace. Eustace!

38:54.586 --> 38:57.222
He can't move.

38:57.322 --> 38:59.558
And neither can you.

39:01.093 --> 39:02.928
You don't need
to be afraid of us.

39:13.272 --> 39:15.507
(panting)

39:25.985 --> 39:28.120
Oh, my God.

39:28.220 --> 39:30.589
-Oh, my God.
-WITCH 2: We should have
been here sooner,

39:30.690 --> 39:33.125
but your spells were very weak.

39:33.225 --> 39:34.627
We could barely detect them.

39:34.727 --> 39:37.296
Did you say "spells"?

39:37.396 --> 39:39.431
You're one of us.

39:40.299 --> 39:41.868
OTIS:
Don't leave me.

39:41.968 --> 39:45.604
I still promise
I'll be your mommy,

39:45.704 --> 39:47.706
but you can never
come back here.

39:55.514 --> 39:57.716
(Van Wirt whimpers)

40:22.441 --> 40:24.510
You know, it's probably safer

40:24.610 --> 40:26.745
if you don't use
your first name here.

40:26.845 --> 40:28.614
Do you have a middle name?

40:29.448 --> 40:30.749
Spalding.

40:31.517 --> 40:33.018
Spalding it is.

40:33.118 --> 40:36.589
And if anyone asks, you've
been here your entire life,

40:36.689 --> 40:38.390
just like your father
before you

40:38.491 --> 40:41.126
-and his father before...
-Him.

40:41.227 --> 40:43.129
(chuckles)

40:43.229 --> 40:45.330
(footsteps approaching)

40:46.599 --> 40:47.900
I'm Myrtle.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.435
I'm Spalding.

40:49.535 --> 40:51.370
It's nice to have someone here
my own age.

40:51.471 --> 40:53.305
I plan to run this place
someday.
