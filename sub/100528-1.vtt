00:00.001 --> 00:02.334
[microphone droans]

00:06.273 --> 00:07.639
[woman 1] I just love
what you did here.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.074
You know, just blowing
the background out

00:09.076 --> 00:10.342
and keeping her in focus.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.477
[woman 2] It really makes
a statement I think.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.611
[woman 1] And we'll do it
in black and white.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.446
Like a whole monochrome thing.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.216
[woman 2] I think all we need
now is a really strong lead in.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.485
Something on the, uh...
light side, though.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.620
Because this is very
kind of powerful,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.156
-already overwhelming.
-We don't want it be too heavy.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.760
-We talked about that.
-[man] Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

00:27.762 --> 00:31.630
-Oh, God! Fabulous.
-Thank you.

00:31.632 --> 00:35.434
So raw. It's like I can see who
she is just from the photograph.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.237
Mm-hm. Like right there
it's like her soul.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.240
-And I'm just looking into it.
-They're never the same

00:41.242 --> 00:44.643
after their first big story, the
innocence is gone after that.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.311
She hasn't been innocent since
she got to four million

00:46.313 --> 00:47.813
Instagram followers.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.448
[man] I love what you do
with her eyes.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.084
'Cause she has such
beautiful lashes, you know?

00:52.086 --> 00:53.786
[woman 1] It's what her
following loves her for.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.154
It's what she's known for.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.488
[woman 2] That
and her overbite.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.725
Which I think was so perfect
for this setup.

00:59.727 --> 01:04.730

02:33.320 --> 02:36.855
<i> The National Influencer</i>
is really the <i> Vanity Fair</i>

02:36.857 --> 02:39.892
or the <i> People</i> magazine
for the modern day celebrity.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.860
Celebrity obviously meaning
people with large

02:41.862 --> 02:43.595
-social media followings.
-Mm-hm.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.764
Someone does a lip synch number
with their family.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.699
Um, gets a million views
on YouTube.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.203
Someone manages to, you know,
light themselves on fire.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.205
Not quite get hurt,
yet have it go viral.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.740
-That was a great spread.
-Yeah,<i> The National Influencer</i>

02:54.742 --> 02:57.576
-went public after that one.
-Yeah. It did.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.678
And we're the ones
who break those stories,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.513
who cover those stories
and those characters.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.615
It's so important
those stories are told.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.716
Absolutely. And we're proud
to be going on five years here

03:05.719 --> 03:07.586
at <i> The National Influencer.</i>

03:07.588 --> 03:09.621
Um, and we're currently
in the midst of working

03:09.623 --> 03:12.191
on our fifth anniversary issue
which we're very excited about.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.825
Yeah. Fifi the Frenchie

03:13.827 --> 03:16.195
was really just
the Cinderella story,

03:16.197 --> 03:18.330
you know, of the issue.
She's the up and comer.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.598
-Where did she come from?
-And she's only

03:19.600 --> 03:21.433
at four million
Instagram followers.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.935
But you know numbers
aren't everything.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.403
No, we don't hold that
against her.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.371
-No, we like an underdog.
-And the pun

03:26.373 --> 03:27.706
was good for the story as well.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.776
Fifi's involvement
was so important

03:30.778 --> 03:34.513
because it really just
humanizes the issue.

03:34.515 --> 03:38.317
Um, that being said,
Fifi did not make the cover

03:38.319 --> 03:40.285
of the anniversary issue
because the cover

03:40.287 --> 03:42.721
of the anniversary issue
are the real stars of the show.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.891
It'll be the top five
social media influencers,

03:45.893 --> 03:48.393
all who have over
ten million followers.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.530
So, you know, get ready,
hold on to your hats, yeah.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.482
I'll be doing the shoot,
actually.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.433
And I plan it to be very
Annie Liebovitz style.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.302
-Yeah.
-It'll be obviously

03:57.304 --> 04:00.005
group photo shoot
with these five influencers.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.908
Mm-hm. We're calling them
the Social Ones.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.510
And our goal, you know,
ultimately

04:05.512 --> 04:06.845
is to just kind of peel back
the layers

04:06.847 --> 04:09.681
on these five sages,
so to speak.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.950
There's so much more
to them than meets the eye.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.686
-So much more.
-And the iPhone.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.555
There's Dan Summers,
the king of Snapchat.

04:17.558 --> 04:21.326
Hey, y'all.
Top of that tree in ten seconds.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.961
I know I have 60 seconds
for this snap,

04:22.963 --> 04:25.430
but I'll do it in ten.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.898
Brenda, start the timer.
Let's do it.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.867
Come on!

04:29.536 --> 04:31.870
Oh! Whoa!

04:31.872 --> 04:33.839
Yo, it's silk.
It's 100 percent silk,

04:33.841 --> 04:37.009
so I'm just flying, that's all.
Let's get it.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.778
My grippies, grippies!
Come on!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.480
[Ava] Twenty-five million
followers.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.282
It's hard to really explain
what he does.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.816
He's just Dan Summers.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.485
Oh!

04:46.487 --> 04:48.387
Cut it, that one's good though.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.472
That one's high.

04:50.473 --> 04:52.556
And then there's the
fashion Instagram star, JosieZ.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.960
Wow. Incredible.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.695
What is this look,
45 for today?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.063
It's actually 43.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.035
-There she is.
-It looks so--

05:03.037 --> 05:05.470
-There she is.
-Probably looks so good.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.973
-Just get down there.
-Yeah.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.908
-Whoa!
-I like that.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.743
Probably a little better if I
was doing it, though. Right?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.413
-No.
-Just completely on the pulse

05:14.415 --> 05:16.481
-of couture.
-Completely.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.051
Uh, Dixie Bell, who is
the goddess of viral food.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.920
Yes, Instagram, yes!

05:21.922 --> 05:24.056
Want that ready for YouTube
in two minutes!

05:25.426 --> 05:28.627
Okay. We talked
about this yesterday.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.929
And the day before.
If you do not understand

05:30.931 --> 05:34.433
how to combine a deep dish pizza
and a donut

05:34.435 --> 05:37.369
to make a beautiful
hybrid dessert...

05:37.371 --> 05:39.438
I don't know how to talk to you.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.543
I don't know how to talk to her!

05:44.545 --> 05:47.012
-No vision!
-Making quick food images

05:47.014 --> 05:49.614
and videos shareable and viral
is her expertise.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.984
Yeah. Completely. And then
there's the vlogger, Jane Zap.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.020
She has a good presence
on Facebook.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.555
What? This is a bowtie?

05:56.557 --> 06:00.092
Uh, we need a blazer
and some pants.

06:00.094 --> 06:04.863
This is just so unrealistic for
a red carpet Instagram event.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.966
I'm just--
I'm just not really sure...

06:07.968 --> 06:13.538
Um, hey, Karen? Do we have any
other options for Clementine?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.874
He looks like he's going
to the gym.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.810
It's not always clear
what her angle is,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.912
but her photos and videos
of animals

06:20.914 --> 06:22.881
dressed in costume
always get great engagements.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.951
Uh, and last
but certainly not least,

06:25.953 --> 06:27.386
the meme god, Kap Phat Jawacki,

06:27.388 --> 06:29.654
with 19 million
Instagram followers.

06:29.656 --> 06:33.792
Me sending a new meme
out into the world.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.129
[sighs] How will the people
be impacted?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.031
It's always a roll
of the dice.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.002
Boom!

06:44.004 --> 06:46.605
What a get for this issue.
He is just so versatile.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.039
He's not just
a meme god anymore.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.075
He's completely expanded
his brand.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.110
[Mia] He's the new face
of Clinique now.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.946
-No? Wow.
-And Pampers.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.115
What you're doing on social
media is who you are.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.484
-That's you.
-I could not have put it better.

06:59.486 --> 07:00.719
You hit the nail on the head.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.454
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.524
Engagement. It doesn't
mean marriage anymore.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.492
-No, not in the slightest.
-What does it mean?

07:07.494 --> 07:09.728
-It means shares, views, reach.
-Likes.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.096
-Horse likes.
-Comments.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.131
-Even negative comments.
-Any comment will do really.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.501
Even a letter. We don't know how
these influencers do it.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.969
These are the gods of today,
really.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.604
These are the 21st century
deities

07:19.606 --> 07:23.442
and that's why we've been
telling their stories

07:23.444 --> 07:25.977
for five years now.

07:25.979 --> 07:31.183
What do you say to a guy with
19 million Instagram followers?

07:31.185 --> 07:33.952
Where do you even begin?
It would be a bit like

07:33.954 --> 07:36.154
casually approaching Gandhi
at a dinner party.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.824
What's the icebreaker
with someone like that?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.959
[Ava] Someone like Kap Phat
Jawacki has a way

07:40.961 --> 07:43.995
of Instagramming
where the Instagram just

07:43.997 --> 07:46.064
becomes immortal.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.699
They're modern day poets.

07:47.701 --> 07:51.470
And there have definitely been
one too many times

07:51.472 --> 07:54.673
where, you know,
episodes do happen for me.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.141
-Anxiety attacks.
-They're not quite

07:56.143 --> 07:58.643
anxiety attacks, just more like
30 minutes or so at a time

07:58.645 --> 08:00.912
where I can't breathe or I feel
like I'm gonna die

08:00.914 --> 08:02.881
or there's an elephant
kind of just sitting flush

08:02.883 --> 08:05.016
on my chest
and he's not getting up.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.719
Anxiety attacks.
As we covered more people,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.254
you've gotten more comfortable.
She's gotten more comfortable.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.523
It's true. I mean, how do you
get to Carnegie Hall?

08:11.525 --> 08:14.759
After five years, the elephant's
become more like, you know,

08:14.761 --> 08:17.629
kind of a hippo
or a small Buick.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.698
-Right, you said that last time.
-So that's an improvement.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.000
We do always bring Xanax
to shoots with us now.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.268
-Miracle stuff.
-Yeah.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.103
Um, but this group photo shoot

08:25.105 --> 08:28.039
is set to be
our biggest story yet.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.642
All of these influencers
will be...

08:30.644 --> 08:32.544
-[clears throat] Mm-hm.
-...in the same place...

08:32.546 --> 08:34.246
-Mm.
-...at the same time,

08:34.248 --> 08:36.914
come April 10th.
And we are prepared for that.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.750
-Right? Um...
-Yeah.

08:38.751 --> 08:42.053
-We've even been--
-Excuse me.

08:42.054 --> 08:45.156
Just... just need
to get a snack.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.828
We've even brought on experts,
um,

08:49.830 --> 08:51.596
on the periphery of social media

08:51.598 --> 08:53.064
to be part
of the anniversary issue.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.834
Just as to give all
of this context.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.304
People say social media is fast,
but its history,

08:59.306 --> 09:04.876
its ten to 20 year history
is in fact slow.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.245
What I'm here to do
is break down the theory

09:07.247 --> 09:11.950
behind being, as they say,
social

09:11.952 --> 09:15.053
on the world wide...
on the world wide web.

09:15.055 --> 09:19.658
Now, we've grasped
what a "like" is.

09:19.660 --> 09:24.829
But can anyone tell me
what... is...

09:24.831 --> 09:27.933
a... share?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.635
Anybody?

09:33.840 --> 09:35.206
Hot.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.043
Well, it is true that I haven't
had as much time

09:38.044 --> 09:40.879
as I'd like to...
to build my own followings.

09:40.881 --> 09:44.749
I certainly am an expert
in social media theory.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.119
They've not yet awarded
doctorates for the subject.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.956
But if they did,
I would no doubt have one.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.825
A, uh... a PhD.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.127
I actually preemptively asked
friends and students

09:56.129 --> 09:58.863
and colleagues to call me
Dr. Schpelnick,

09:58.865 --> 10:01.032
just take your questions
to the doc.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.636
I'll show you this function.
Press the home button

10:04.638 --> 10:06.605
and the power off
at the same time.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.872
You got a screenshot.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.375
What I really care about
is what I'm teaching...

10:13.046 --> 10:16.147
these kids.
They need me.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.250
All I can do
is give them the tools.

10:19.252 --> 10:23.822
After that, it's, uh...
it's up to them.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.158
Don't forget that fashion can
also take nature into account.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
[music plays]

10:29.162 --> 10:31.096
See that? Wingtips.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.664
Oil is our enemy.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.133
You wanna have everything
be completely matte.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.971
Most meditation practices say
"tune out, shut off,

10:39.973 --> 10:43.041
don't let anything come inside."
I say no.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.977
I say let it all in,
because if your phone rings,

10:45.979 --> 10:46.845
you gotta know.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.315
I don't know what people mean
when they say

10:50.317 --> 10:53.652
you have to do crazy things
to get followers.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.888
You just have to be
your authentic self.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.357
That's what social media's
all about.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.060
What would you normally wear
on any given day?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.662
What do you throw on?

11:03.664 --> 11:05.864
You know, what would you do
on any given day?

11:05.866 --> 11:08.900
This is as high as it goes.
Fashion beats range of motion.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.869
That's what you wanna chronicle.

11:10.871 --> 11:15.106
Your followers will know if
you're not being real with them.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.879
I'm gonna lay here, and then
this shot needs to be up

11:20.881 --> 11:23.682
from a window, higher up,
like fourth story at least.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.217
-Up there.
-My nose job is fresh.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.387
I know how I want it to look.
It needs to be an aerial view.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.023
Sure. Just that window,
right up there, huh?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.759
Benjamin, I hear hesitation
in your voice.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.428
-Oh, no...
-And when you hesitate,

11:36.430 --> 11:38.363
I hesitate because
you're hesitating.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.865
Okay! Scale away, Spiderman!

11:40.867 --> 11:44.769
Ever since my last intern
shattered both her collar bones

11:44.771 --> 11:47.005
while she was shimmying up
a fire escape,

11:47.007 --> 11:49.908
clumsy gal, I make all of them
sign waivers

11:49.910 --> 11:52.377
before they start working
with me.

11:52.379 --> 11:56.181
Because they may look sturdy,
but they may not be.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.483
It's not that I don't care
about their bones

11:58.485 --> 12:00.085
or their bodies

12:00.087 --> 12:02.754
or that I'm deliberately putting
them in danger.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.256
I would never do that.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.092
So there's got to be
a way we can get the shot

12:07.094 --> 12:09.127
from inside of the oven
shooting out.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.929
So it's like
I've just baked something

12:10.931 --> 12:12.831
and I'm pulling it
out of the oven.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.833
It's the food's point of view.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.035
I wanna see
what my pie is seeing.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.437
-So just...
-In the oven.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.773
Okay. Sure.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.976
If they want to live the life,

12:24.978 --> 12:27.912
if they want to have
in the thousands of followers,

12:27.914 --> 12:30.048
then they need to learn from me.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.050
They need to follow my lead.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.018
I consider my internship
with Josie

12:34.020 --> 12:36.788
to be the single best thing
that has ever happened to me.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.491
-So... thank you so much.
-Okay.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.392
-Thank you.
-Stop it.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.862
I started
an Instagram story series

12:43.864 --> 12:46.931
following the progression
of my arms and hands.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.399
The recovery.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.468
-So every morning, I...
-Okay, let's take it...

12:50.470 --> 12:52.237
I peel the bandages off
and...

12:52.239 --> 12:54.372
-Pick up the pace.
-And then I take photos

12:54.374 --> 12:58.042
and videos and people
are just loving it.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.879
-It's disgusting!
-But it is very shareable.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.247
-My--
-Tell them what your follow

13:02.249 --> 13:03.982
account is up to. Remind me.
Tell them.

13:03.984 --> 13:07.018
Since the burn series,
I'm at about 11,000 followers

13:07.020 --> 13:09.053
-on Instagram.
-Eleven thousand.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.955
When he first started with me,
he was at 11.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.423
And six of them were bots.
[laughs]

13:12.425 --> 13:15.193
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

13:15.195 --> 13:17.028
Think of how many followers
he'll have

13:17.030 --> 13:19.030
when he can use
his hands again.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.800
Uh, yeah, cross my fingers,
you know,

13:21.802 --> 13:24.402
it'll be about six months
and it'll just be...

13:24.404 --> 13:26.204
-back to normal.
-I'll cross 'em for you, Ben,

13:26.206 --> 13:28.306
'cause you can't. [laughs]

13:28.308 --> 13:30.475
But Ben, it's more like a year,
maybe two.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.444
The doctor did say it could be
two full years like this.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.848
So we've developed a special
selfie contraption

13:36.850 --> 13:39.017
so we can keep posting
to my social outlets.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.952
Content does not sleep.

13:40.954 --> 13:44.088
We can't post less
due to some skin grafts.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.925
Unbelievable! Let's go over
to black and white now!

13:46.927 --> 13:49.460
-Do I need more contouring?
-God, no, your cheek bones

13:49.462 --> 13:51.529
look incredible,
like they could cut steel!

13:51.531 --> 13:53.531
Cut steel.
That would collapse a building.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.400
-Yeah.
-Get closer.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.870
Closer. Closer.
A little closer.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.371
A little closer.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.340
That's where my audience
wants me to be.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.259
Nose to nose.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.177
Yo, this moss is really
susceptible to moonwalking.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.446
[Ava] <i> The biggest star of our</i>
<i> anniversary group cover shoot</i>

14:08.448 --> 14:10.515

14:10.517 --> 14:12.283

14:23.597 --> 14:25.964
But-- [coughs] Fuck, man.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.533
Ah!

14:28.535 --> 14:30.935
Yo, Brendan, they didn't explode
like you said they would, but...

14:30.937 --> 14:34.305
Just coming to you from my
neighbor, Mr. Radley's, house.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.474
I'm gonna juggle in his house
while convincing Mr. Radley

14:36.476 --> 14:39.510
there's a fire in his home!
There's a fire in your house!

14:39.512 --> 14:42.046
Oh, my God!
Oh, people are dying out here!

14:42.048 --> 14:43.514
He's like 90 years old!

14:43.516 --> 14:46.417
[music plays]

15:07.674 --> 15:10.508
Dan.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.644
-Dan, hi.
-Hi.

15:12.646 --> 15:16.381
-Huge, huge fan.
-Oh!

15:16.383 --> 15:20.151
Your most recent YouTube video
where you sat on the couch

15:20.153 --> 15:23.087
and, um, oh, God!
In real time,

15:23.089 --> 15:26.658
reacted to videos of other
people doing extreme sports

15:26.660 --> 15:29.661
was... oh!
It was genius.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.629
-Thanks.
-I mean, I don't know how

15:31.631 --> 15:33.298
you come up with stuff like
that because, you know,

15:33.300 --> 15:36.100
I myself am also
a content creator.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.269
-So when I try to create--
-Andy!

15:38.271 --> 15:40.571
-Yeah?
-I need you to post the tweet

15:40.573 --> 15:43.074
-about the stylist.
-Okay. I will.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.678
-So, um, when I try to--
-Now, please.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.380
Hold that thought.
I will be right back.

15:50.650 --> 15:55.420
What the... [giggles]

15:55.422 --> 15:57.021
Refresh!

15:57.023 --> 15:59.023
[woman] You are arguably
one of the biggest

15:59.025 --> 16:00.725
Snapchat celebrities.
What's the definition

16:00.727 --> 16:04.195
-of good content for you?
-Unique.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.064
And what would your advice be
to those trying

16:06.066 --> 16:08.533
to create great content
on social media?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.301
Deliver.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.239
Could you elaborate on that,
Dan?

16:15.241 --> 16:17.976
Dan doesn't provide more
than one word answers,

16:17.978 --> 16:20.011
unless it's on social media.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.980
In the worst case, he'll give
an answer that's exactly

16:21.982 --> 16:23.514
60 seconds long.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.249
That's the maximum length
of a Snapchat video,

16:25.251 --> 16:26.551
but that's more
for philanthropic

16:26.553 --> 16:28.219
or political issues.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.489
Issues he truly cares about,
or real life encounters.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.159
Life or death situations
and stuff like that.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.561
[woman] Like serious situations.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.663
No, literally life or death.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.000
Uh, Dan was mugged
at gunpoint last year,

16:42.002 --> 16:45.169
and only exchanged 11 words
with his mugger.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.306
He Snapchatted the whole
experience, of course.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.607
[whispers] I'll be in the back.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.476
[woman] Understood.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.644
[clears throat] Um,
do you have a second

16:53.646 --> 16:55.546
favorite social platform?
Instagram, maybe?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.181
Do you like Instagram?

16:59.619 --> 17:02.320
I...

17:02.322 --> 17:05.356
was told I was not gonna
be asked about Instagram.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.192
-Dan doesn't--
-Yeah, I don't talk...

17:08.194 --> 17:11.128
about Instagram!

17:11.131 --> 17:12.563
Okay?

17:14.434 --> 17:17.135
Do your fucking job!

17:17.137 --> 17:19.470
My mom was right about you!

17:19.472 --> 17:21.772
That stories bullshit?

17:21.775 --> 17:23.708
Where you think
they got it from?

17:24.511 --> 17:27.045
From me!

17:27.047 --> 17:29.647
Fuck, man!

17:29.649 --> 17:31.582
Fuck Instagram!

17:32.419 --> 17:34.385
Fuck Instagram!

17:34.387 --> 17:37.321
[sobbing] Fuck Instagram.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.757
[woman] You simply can't ask
a social media influencer

17:39.759 --> 17:42.326
about a following they're not
as strong in.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.296
If a person has two million
Snapchat followers,

17:45.298 --> 17:48.132
but a million on Instagram,
well,

17:48.134 --> 17:50.134
that isn't something they're
going to want to discuss,

17:50.136 --> 17:51.836
or even share for that matter.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.338
I've seen the case many times.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.208
It all happens right here
in the cerebral cortex,

17:57.210 --> 17:58.843
in this point
in the frontal lobe.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.313
This is where emotions,
reasoning,

18:02.315 --> 18:04.282
and planning are associated.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.418
And when a person has stress
or anxiety about

18:07.420 --> 18:10.421
a low Pinterest following
or negative comment on Facebook,

18:10.423 --> 18:13.558
well, that activity,
it happens right here.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.860
And when a person has a
significantly weaker following

18:15.862 --> 18:18.329
on one platform,
it creates a kind of frenzy

18:18.331 --> 18:20.498
that moves throughout
the frontal lobe.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.233
It can lead to anything.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.502
Anxiety, depression.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.671
I've seen it lead
to hospitalization.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.807
The point is, you have to know
these people's follower counts

18:29.809 --> 18:32.610
before you interact with them.
It's crucial.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.845
And I would give this advice
to anyone who's

18:33.847 --> 18:36.147
in the same building
as an influencer.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.715
It's an entirely different
ballgame,

18:37.717 --> 18:39.350
dealing with these people.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.653
You have to be sensitive.
You have to take care.

18:42.655 --> 18:46.624
We've been a bit stressed
because no one has heard

18:46.626 --> 18:48.392
from Dan Summers.

18:48.394 --> 18:51.395
-He officially stopped snapping.
-Eleven hours ago.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.798
-Wild, wild stuff. Yeah.
-Basically stopped.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.700
Um, so as you can imagine,
we're in the midst

18:55.702 --> 18:59.270
of some contingency planning
here at the magazine.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.473
I'd say a lot
of contingency planning. Yeah.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.809
-Has he done this before?
-Only when he was, you know,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.744
protesting the length
of a Snapchat being extended

19:06.746 --> 19:08.830
from ten seconds to 60 seconds.

19:08.831 --> 19:10.915
But then he was still posting
ten second videos on YouTube

19:10.917 --> 19:12.750
-every ten seconds.
-The ten on ten wave.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.218
He really moved
the needle there.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.486
-Hey, Andy?
-Yeah?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.821
What's next
on the Instagram queue?

19:16.823 --> 19:19.290
Todd... ler.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.591
I need more information
than that.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.261
There have been like 11 toddler
memes this week.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.666
-Why...
-What am I missing here?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.902
He's trying to do that
one word answer thing

19:30.904 --> 19:32.670
-that Dan Summers did.
-Is that supposed

19:32.672 --> 19:33.938
to be commemorative?
I don't...

19:33.940 --> 19:35.873
And also writing
the sentence down

19:35.875 --> 19:38.442
is exactly the same thing as
speaking it out of your mouth.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.311
-Yes, it is.
-You're giving me anxiety

19:40.313 --> 19:42.380
which is a very easy thing
to do, but still.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.749
Leave. Exit. Thank you.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.819
-Oh, my God.
-[phone chimes]

19:48.821 --> 19:51.589
Yeah, so is texting it
to my phone.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.257
Texting it to my phone
is the same thing

19:53.259 --> 19:56.227
as writing it down.
News alert.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.828
[phone chimes]

19:57.830 --> 20:00.631
You're officially fired.
Oh. Okay.

20:00.633 --> 20:04.702
No, it's, uh... it's
a Dan Summers news alert.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.272
-And? And? And?
-Um, well, he...

20:08.274 --> 20:10.808
he sort of checked himself
into a hos--

20:10.810 --> 20:15.546
-Oh! Oh, God!
-It's the one upstate.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.199
-They have Pilates.
-Yep.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.851
This is very disconcerting!
Very disconcerting!

20:20.853 --> 20:22.820
God!

20:22.822 --> 20:28.526
Rob is very sensitive
about our interview subjects.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.963
Yeah. There was... an incident
a few years ago.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.153
-Yeah.
-We're not supposed

20:33.154 --> 20:34.342
to talk about it,
we don't go into it.

20:34.343 --> 20:35.531
-Exactly.
-Injunctions of any kind

20:35.535 --> 20:38.002
are hard when you're trying
to run a publication.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.905
-Is this not talking about it?
-Just the detail.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.773
Side note. Great.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.709
Anyways, we don't wanna be
responsible for driving

20:44.711 --> 20:46.777
-anyone insane.
-No. Especially someone

20:46.779 --> 20:48.346
with 25 million
Snapchat followers.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.348
-They have a responsibility.
-Yeah.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.884
Uh, so once the dust settled,
we went to see Dan

20:53.886 --> 20:56.320
after he got out
of the hospital.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.989
He's living
with his mom temporarily.

20:57.991 --> 21:00.291
Doing very well. Um...

21:00.293 --> 21:03.261
He's been off Snapchat
for a full week now.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.762
But doing well.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.965
Sure.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.578
Wow. A CD player.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.348
How retro.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.617
It's true, I really loved
those growing up.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.236
I didn't love those growing up.

21:28.237 --> 21:29.854
I always use the word "retro"
when I see something

21:29.856 --> 21:32.323
-I haven't seen before.
-She does.

21:32.325 --> 21:35.960
[Ava] So listen. I know we
didn't quite get what we needed

21:35.962 --> 21:39.597
-for your individual story.
-This would be...

21:39.599 --> 21:43.301
a very interesting angle.
Okay.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.537
We would still love for you
to be part of the group shoot.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.806
Right? I think it wouldn't
be the same without you.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.841
-She speaks for both of us.
-Mm-hm. I do.

21:50.843 --> 21:55.079
[Mia] We talked to your mom
upstairs, and, uh,

21:55.081 --> 21:58.582
told her all the details,
the shoot's in two weeks.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.384
She's gonna, you know,
drive you.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.653
And, um, until then, you know...

22:03.856 --> 22:06.657
you... you just
take some you time.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.760
Or, uh...

22:09.762 --> 22:12.897
whatever-- whatever it is
that you need to do.

22:15.101 --> 22:18.602
It's very common after
an influencer experiences

22:18.604 --> 22:21.339
a breakdown for he or she
to procure

22:21.341 --> 22:24.709
a very serious case of AND.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.778
What we in
the mental health space call it,

22:27.780 --> 22:30.981
it's Acute Nostalgia Disorder.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.850
And the subject can revert back
to a time

22:32.852 --> 22:34.719
where he or she thinks is...

22:34.721 --> 22:37.855
things are slower,
things are simpler.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.958
And that can manifest itself
in a variety

22:40.960 --> 22:43.361
of really disturbing behaviors.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.496
Anything from playing Mario Kart
all day

22:45.498 --> 22:47.832
to going to arcades,

22:47.834 --> 22:50.501
buying DVD players,

22:50.503 --> 22:54.038
searching for the last remaining
Blockbuster video store.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.909
Sometimes the subjects have
physical posters in their rooms

22:58.911 --> 23:01.512
of '90s boy bands.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.782
Anything from NSYNC
to Backstreet Boys.

23:04.784 --> 23:08.719
And in the more serious cases,
98 Degrees.

23:08.721 --> 23:12.390
Does it make you angry?
Does it make you sad

23:12.392 --> 23:16.627
to think about a time that might
have been... better than now?

23:16.629 --> 23:19.096
I don't know,
just like a douche.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.498
It makes you feel like a douche.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.402
-Yeah.
-We have 42 minutes left

23:24.404 --> 23:25.536
in our session.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.872
We can talk about
anything you like.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.674
I'd like to talk about...
flashcards.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.810
-Flashcards.
-Yeah.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.011
You know, like at school.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.849
When you study for a test.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.419
And you write.

23:41.421 --> 23:45.156
Like you write,
like with a pencil.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.461
You'd write the answer
on one side of the card

23:50.463 --> 23:53.564
and a question on the other.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.633
Is that something you used
to do in school, Daniel?

23:55.635 --> 23:58.869
No. No-- no, of course not.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.906
My parents once told me
about it in a story.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.074
It sounds kind of nice.

24:04.076 --> 24:08.946
The answer...
and the question.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.884
You used to use flashcards.
Right?

24:13.886 --> 24:17.188
Or like floppy discs? I've never
even seen a floppy disc.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.491
Well, you're lucky.

24:20.493 --> 24:24.495
Um, Daniel has a long way to go.

24:24.497 --> 24:29.133
And I need to use my knowledge

24:29.135 --> 24:33.070
to bring patience and
understanding to the situation.

24:33.072 --> 24:37.475
Despite what I believe
is his sometimes...

24:37.477 --> 24:39.877
How to describe him? I...

24:39.879 --> 24:42.646
I think the only way sometimes
is just he's...

24:42.648 --> 24:44.682
He can be something of a shit.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.688
I cannot reach the mountaintop.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.957
I'm nowhere near
the mountaintop.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.758
You're very near
the mountaintop.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.094
No, I'm nowhere near
the mountaintop!

24:57.096 --> 24:58.696
And if I do not reach
the mountaintop,

24:58.698 --> 25:00.231
I cannot tweet it.

25:00.233 --> 25:04.902
What is that sound?

25:04.904 --> 25:08.539
It's like a ticking,
it's like a tick, tick, tick.

25:08.541 --> 25:12.009
-Do you hear that, Benjamin?
-Of course I hear it.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.979
It's, uh, it's maddening,
the ticking.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.748
Yes. How is anybody supposed to
get anything done around here?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.517
I think you might be famished.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.218
I'm going to go get you
a Fig Newton.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.255
Yes.
I'm practically wasting away.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.824
-Wait!
-Yeah.

25:26.826 --> 25:32.029
Benjamin, I think it's more
of a Mallomar kind of a day.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.598
-I'll get you a Mallomar.
-Yes, get me a Mallomar!

25:34.600 --> 25:36.166
-That's what I just said!
-Yes, yes.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.802
I've had two--
Ben, what is it?

25:38.804 --> 25:40.704
-Three, actually.
-Three!

25:40.706 --> 25:43.173
I've had three nervous
breakdowns

25:43.175 --> 25:45.743
since I started this job
three years ago. [laughs]

25:45.745 --> 25:47.211
Which is par for the course,
you know.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.880
Time flies
when you're breaking down.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.750
-[both laugh]
-Jobs are stressful.

25:52.752 --> 25:56.253
And I'd imagine if you'd ask
any surgeon or president,

25:56.255 --> 25:59.156
-they'd also agree with me.
-Oh, absolutely.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.326
And then the third time that I
was admitted to the "facility,"

26:02.328 --> 26:04.194
against my own will, of course,

26:04.196 --> 26:06.964
they strapped me down
to a gurney and restrained me.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.233
My whole body was shaking
and I was shouting things

26:09.235 --> 26:10.734
like, "I hate you!
I'm gonna kill you!"

26:10.736 --> 26:11.969
You know, playful things
like that.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.772
But Ben and I had this
very unique moment

26:14.774 --> 26:16.774
where we looked
at my leather straps

26:16.776 --> 26:18.108
mixed with my chunky bracelets.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.427
Ben, do you remember
this moment?

26:20.428 --> 26:22.745
-I love that moment.
-It was almost like this very--

26:22.748 --> 26:25.649
-It was very meta.
-Meta is the perfect word

26:25.651 --> 26:27.318
-to describe--
-Thank you. I said meta.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.986
That's why I said it.
It was the leather straps

26:28.988 --> 26:30.220
mixed with the gold.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.756
National Influencer covered it.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.892
Stackable is everything.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.327
We even got a sponsorship
from...

26:36.329 --> 26:38.228
-It's true.
-What's that--

26:38.230 --> 26:39.697
-What's that little tiny place?
-Cartier?

26:39.699 --> 26:42.299
Cartier. I love Mr. Cartier.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.268
Just in time for my release.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.171
It only took Ben about eight
months to convince the doctors

26:47.173 --> 26:49.740
I wasn't a threat to myself.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.042
Or to anybody else.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.079
-Ha!
-[gasps]

26:55.081 --> 26:56.947
I like to keep him on his toes.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.783
Hi, guys. I like to think
in the park.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.785
Where do you like to think?

27:01.787 --> 27:04.054
Talk soon.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.824
Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Hi, guys.

27:06.826 --> 27:12.229
Hi. I'm so excited to share
what just happened today.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.798
I got a whole new litter
of new models.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.972
I need you to cast your votes.

27:21.974 --> 27:27.411
One barrette or... two.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.414
Let me know. Love you guys.

27:33.986 --> 27:37.721
So what I'm hearing is that you
have real feelings of loss,

27:37.723 --> 27:40.357
of remorse,
that you feel powerless.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.960
Mm-hm. Yeah.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.262
It's how I've been feeling.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.232
The following is just...

27:48.234 --> 27:50.034
It's okay, Jane, you can say.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.703
The following has
just plateaued.

27:52.705 --> 27:56.907
Jane, it's important for me
to say what I am about to.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.211
I think it's gone
a little too far.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.213
What makes you think that?

28:04.684 --> 28:07.384
Well, the dogs are with us
at all of our sessions.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.354
And they're with you even
when you're not vlogging.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.222
You said that this building
was dog-friendly.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.224
-I did.
-That's why I chose you. I...

28:14.226 --> 28:16.160
I did. I did say that.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.962
It's just that I think you could
use a little bit of a break.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.265
And I don't want you to take
this angst into your shoot

28:21.267 --> 28:23.200
for <i> The National Influencer.</i>

28:23.202 --> 28:25.069
I think this cover shoot
is a great opportunity

28:25.071 --> 28:27.938
for you to get yourself
back out there.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.475
It's the litter, isn't it?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.079
It's partially the litter. Yes.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.314
But let's get back to you.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.851
-I could move that--
-Just stay still.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.120
Oh--

28:43.122 --> 28:45.089
Right there.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.727
Stay.

28:49.729 --> 28:53.097
I think it's very, very
dangerous territory

28:53.099 --> 28:55.099
when someone starts to see
their numbers slide.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.134
It feeds a vicious circle.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.869
They see their numbers slide,
they lose confidence,

28:58.871 --> 29:00.437
so the numbers keep sliding,
so they lose their confidence,

29:00.439 --> 29:02.306
so the numbers keep sliding.

29:02.307 --> 29:04.174
And they go to greater
and greater lengths

29:04.176 --> 29:07.311
to hit that high again.
It's like an addiction.

29:07.313 --> 29:10.214
And first it's animals.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.099
And then the animals
get smaller.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.983
And then there are baby animals,
and there are baby baby animals.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.919
And often it results
in miniatures.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.254
Dogs, turtles, what have you.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.858
And of course there is a rampant
amount of ODAUFI:

29:20.860 --> 29:23.260
Obsessively Dressing Animals
Up For Instagram.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.162
It's probably our biggest fight
right now

29:25.164 --> 29:28.031
in the medical front,
to find a cure.

29:28.033 --> 29:33.003
You know, we have run up against
PETA on a number of occasions.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.906
I think the patients
I'm dealing with certainly

29:35.908 --> 29:38.442
are coming
with benign purposes.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.177
Of course, there's no intent
to harm the animal.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.545
Now, who can say whether
or not the animals

29:41.547 --> 29:43.547
enjoy being dressed up?
I don't think there's

29:43.549 --> 29:46.283
a lot of research on that.
They may or may not.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.318
We don't know. There's a lot
we don't know now.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.120
A lot we don't know.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.523
I'm planking! I'm planking!

30:07.006 --> 30:08.539
Being me.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.909
It's a lot of pressure.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.411
A lot of pressure.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.414
The memes. The captions.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.550
But for me, I just let it flow.

30:19.552 --> 30:22.553
[clicks tongue] You know?

30:22.555 --> 30:25.289
I let my mind run wild.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.157
But I also have a system.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.126
I can it for you right now.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.395
I'm gonna get up now, I'm gonna
walk over to this Wonder Wall.

30:31.397 --> 30:34.198
Okay? [chuckles]

30:34.200 --> 30:38.068
That's what I call it.
I call it the Wonder Wall.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.470
Come on. Let's see
what I have here, hm?

30:42.474 --> 30:45.409
Hm...

30:47.847 --> 30:49.546
Okay, I got "when."

30:49.548 --> 30:51.548
I got the word "when."

30:51.550 --> 30:55.285
Hm...

30:55.287 --> 30:56.920
And I got "bae."

30:56.922 --> 31:02.159
So now I got the phrase
"when... bae."

31:02.161 --> 31:04.595
First step. Hm!

31:06.398 --> 31:09.099
Now, over there...

31:09.101 --> 31:11.635
Ooh, do you feel that?
Ooh, do you feel that?

31:11.637 --> 31:14.104
I'm feeling it. I can't see it,
but I'm feeling it.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.406
There's something, there's
something, there's something

31:16.408 --> 31:19.343
jumping out at me about this
angry-ass looking penguin!

31:19.345 --> 31:22.179
Do you see how angry
this motherfucker looks?

31:22.181 --> 31:24.147
This motherfucker is cold!

31:24.149 --> 31:26.250
[babbles]

31:26.252 --> 31:29.920
Okay. So I got the words
"when" and "bae."

31:29.922 --> 31:32.923
And I got a picture
of an angry-ass penguin.

31:32.925 --> 31:35.192
So now I'm working my mind here.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.894
Sh, sh, sh...

31:36.896 --> 31:40.197
What makes bae angry?

31:40.199 --> 31:44.434
What makes bae look as angry
as that angry-ass penguin?

31:44.436 --> 31:47.571
Ah! Oh! Ha!

31:47.573 --> 31:49.273
Bingo!

31:49.275 --> 31:52.409
Uh...

31:52.411 --> 31:53.911
Strip club.

31:53.913 --> 31:56.513
Hm...

31:56.515 --> 31:58.448
Oh...

31:58.450 --> 32:00.183
Dry cleaners!

32:00.185 --> 32:02.653
When bae thinks you
at the dry cleaners,

32:02.655 --> 32:06.089
but finds out you really
at the strip club.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.692
[clicks tongue, laughs]

32:10.095 --> 32:12.029
And that's how it's done.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.497
Hey, Julian!

32:13.499 --> 32:15.565
Come over here and stick the pin
with the red strong

32:15.567 --> 32:17.334
on the wall, I just did it!

32:19.204 --> 32:20.570
Julian!

32:20.572 --> 32:22.539
I'm not saying there's
no such thing as meme gods.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.975
Of course there are meme gods.

32:24.977 --> 32:28.245
It's just that this meme magic,
as we like to call it

32:28.247 --> 32:32.082
in the mental health space,
I found that it's fleeting.

32:32.084 --> 32:35.152
I had a patient,
it would just come to him,

32:35.154 --> 32:38.455
day after day,
meme after meme after meme.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.657
He called himself
Mofodicktacious.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.559
I'm sure you've heard of him.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.428
He was a modern-day Hemingway.

32:44.430 --> 32:47.364
Just this spartan beauty.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.534
Combination of gifts,
pictures, phrases.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.636
It just came pouring out of him.

32:52.638 --> 32:56.673
Each post more viral
than the next.

32:56.675 --> 33:01.345
And then one day,
he just...

33:01.347 --> 33:03.580
One day the magic just left.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.984
And he...

33:06.986 --> 33:09.653
All that raw talent and all
of that creative inspiration

33:09.655 --> 33:12.189
was just...

33:12.191 --> 33:16.193
He would look at a picture
of a chubby baby,

33:16.195 --> 33:19.062
or a silly picture
of Kanye West,

33:19.064 --> 33:23.033
or even a Kardashian,
and... nothing.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.768
I mean, just nothing.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.138
It was gone.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.675
And then he was gone.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.345
He disappeared and no one knows
where he went.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.218
Glory fades.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.521
Glory fades.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.092
Okay.

33:49.094 --> 33:52.729
Can anyone here tell me

33:52.731 --> 33:55.365
what a Twitter war is?

33:55.367 --> 33:58.335
An internet troll?

33:58.337 --> 34:02.672
As a doctor,
I have a responsibility.

34:02.674 --> 34:06.376
I can let my students learn
to turn the other cheek

34:06.378 --> 34:09.246
and only see the bright side
and only prepare them for that,

34:09.248 --> 34:12.649
or I could prepare them
for what's really out there.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.118
Just the other day,
I posted a Facebook photo

34:15.120 --> 34:16.353
that I was quite proud of.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.088
I had gotten a new bowtie.

34:18.090 --> 34:21.058
I bought it special to wear
to my nephew's bris.

34:21.060 --> 34:27.431
And I had a very harsh,
bullying situation.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.766
Or trolling,
as it's called on social media.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.202
Mother likes to joke.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.204
[chuckles]

34:34.206 --> 34:36.306
But nevertheless,
that wasn't easy to hear.

34:36.308 --> 34:39.208
Social media trolling
is a huge issue.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.512
And we actually uncovered
a troll in our publication.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.563
-Right, Mia?
-Yep.

34:44.565 --> 34:46.614
We did a whole undercover expose
on trolls

34:46.618 --> 34:48.485
for the anniversary issue.

34:48.487 --> 34:49.853
Unbelievable undercover
reporting.

34:49.855 --> 34:53.322
It was like an operation,
like a... like a... a sting.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.860
-A sting operation.
-A sting operation. Yes.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.762
This particular troll,
she was running

34:58.764 --> 35:01.098
a pretty large-scale program
out of a basement in Queens.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.468
We went undercover, exposed
them, closed the place down.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.337
Now that we've decided
on your salaries,

35:07.339 --> 35:10.140
minimum wage split between
the two of you,

35:10.142 --> 35:12.109
I can show you where you'll be.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.888
Julie over there is in charge
of trolling the celebrities.

35:24.890 --> 35:28.291
Jaime, the models,
Sheila, the nighttime TV hosts,

35:28.293 --> 35:30.193
and over there is Emily.

35:30.195 --> 35:34.231
Emily is completely in charge
of the royal family 24/7.

35:34.233 --> 35:38.201
Okay. It's... they actually wear
the troll costumes?

35:40.439 --> 35:43.340
They don't wear troll costumes.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.442
-They are trolls.
-Hm.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.844
And if you two are gonna be
covering award season

35:47.846 --> 35:50.647
and Lena Dunham, you'll
be expected to do the same.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.351
-Okay.
-Now, ladies, in terms

35:54.353 --> 35:56.219
of ventilation,
there isn't any.

35:56.221 --> 35:59.422
So if at any point you feel like
you're going to faint, don't.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.491
Don't.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.662
[Ava] Cardboard really ties
the room together.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.265
-[Mia] Yeah.
-Well, work environments

36:08.267 --> 36:09.699
are very important
for productivity.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.867
-Mm-hm.
-Your next break

36:10.869 --> 36:12.235
is in three days.

36:12.237 --> 36:15.705
I saw a finger not moving.

36:15.707 --> 36:19.809
In the industry we're in,
you see certain things

36:19.811 --> 36:22.445
you just don't necessarily
wanna see.

36:22.447 --> 36:25.182
-Ever again.
-Mm-mm.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.584
This one troll, um...

36:27.586 --> 36:29.186
The one in charge of trolling
the Kardashians,

36:29.188 --> 36:31.655
she was understandably
a bit feisty,

36:31.657 --> 36:35.325
and she just grabbed on
to my hair

36:35.327 --> 36:38.228
when they found out who we were.
Almost pulled a chunk out.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.763
Um, but mainly,
she just kind of, you know,

36:39.765 --> 36:42.632
held on and would not let go.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.834
And I'll tell you, that'll...
that'll give you anxiety.

36:44.836 --> 36:47.237
-Yeah. It even gave me anxiety.
-Yeah.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.405
I got her off eventually,
though.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.840
-Yeah. You got her off.
-Mm-hm.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.243
This is how you make
a hybrid dessert,

36:53.245 --> 36:55.912
or it could also be
a hybrid entree.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.583
[music plays]

37:02.454 --> 37:04.654
I invented this.
It's called rainbow cake.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.425
Put some cereal right on it.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.572
Go further with that cheese.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.308
More. More. Less.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.245
Went way too far.
Way too far.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.280
Did I tell you to stop?

37:30.282 --> 37:32.782
Yes, eggs. Love it.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.018
I like where your head's at.

37:35.020 --> 37:35.952
Actually,
I like where my head's at.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.520
'Cause this was my idea.

37:37.522 --> 37:38.588
I think you could run that
through the deep fryer

37:38.590 --> 37:39.889
one more time, huh?

37:39.891 --> 37:43.660
Everybody plan to be Insta-ready
in five.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.995
[all] Yes, chef!

37:44.997 --> 37:46.763
I didn't hear you say,
"Yes, chef."

37:46.765 --> 37:48.331
Yes, chef.

37:50.402 --> 37:55.805
Here at Fattish F.O.O.D.
we just stay super focused.

37:55.807 --> 37:59.943
We're really just concerned
with your six basic food groups.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.346
Pizza, burgers,
fried hybrid desserts,

38:03.348 --> 38:05.849
fried chicken, and stuff
stuffed with cheese.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.051
[whispers] Three, four, five...

38:08.053 --> 38:10.720
And also...

38:10.722 --> 38:13.556
anything you can dye rainbow.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.759
That's the sixth one.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.727
It's very rewarding work.

38:17.729 --> 38:21.831
Um, we're always very happy
to see an incredible response

38:21.833 --> 38:23.500
in terms of engagement.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.568
I want this to be a treat
for people!

38:25.570 --> 38:27.904
I want this to be a food
they come home to

38:27.906 --> 38:30.006
after their shitty day jobs,

38:30.008 --> 38:32.842
when they're ready to blow
their fucking brains out!

38:32.844 --> 38:35.679
We do everything really,
you know, from...

38:35.681 --> 38:37.981
overhead how-to recipe videos

38:37.983 --> 38:42.319
to before and after shots
of certain foods.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.921
For example,
just off the top of my head,

38:44.923 --> 38:50.860
um, a piece of...
un-fried fried chicken

38:50.862 --> 38:55.498
versus a piece
of deep-fried fried chicken.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.435
Did you fry this again? Did you
put this in the deep fryer?

38:58.437 --> 39:00.003
-Yeah, uh--
-Well, it sure as hell

39:00.005 --> 39:01.438
doesn't look like it.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.840
In fact, this looks like
a piece of shit!

39:04.976 --> 39:08.511
Go put it through...
at least two more times.

39:08.513 --> 39:13.450
I always tell my chefs
to think outside the box.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.951
A phrase that I came up with.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.954
Look, avocados are viral
on their own.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.656
Just as they are,
avocados are perfect.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.424
That means you don't have
to do anything here.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.625
Literally, don't even touch 'em

39:22.627 --> 39:24.094
'cause you'll probably
mess it up.

39:24.096 --> 39:27.063
Think of something you think you
can't stuff with cheese.

39:27.065 --> 39:31.735
And realize... there's probably
a way to stuff it with cheese.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.804
Or, if it's already stuffed
with cheese,

39:34.806 --> 39:38.608
there's probably a way
to stuff it with more cheese.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.845
Take the cherries off!
We need a strong defense!

39:41.847 --> 39:43.580
Defense!

39:43.582 --> 39:45.849
No, no! Those fries
are not gonna--

39:45.851 --> 39:47.717
Don't let those fries score!

39:47.719 --> 39:49.619
Strength and honor!
What is that from?

39:49.621 --> 39:52.689
-What...
-It's from the movie <i> Gladiator!</i>

39:52.691 --> 39:55.592
Same things goes for putting
an egg on something.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.129
Treat bomb.

39:59.131 --> 40:01.598
Eggs are viral.

40:01.600 --> 40:05.435
Yeah. We actually have our motto
right up on the wall.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.570
Oh, there.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.573
I forgot where that wall was.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.510
"You can put an egg
on anything."

40:14.679 --> 40:17.414
That and YCFA.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.450
"You can fry anything."

40:20.452 --> 40:23.686
We got a deep fryer
right over there.

40:23.688 --> 40:26.456
And we'll just throw anything...
anything in there,

40:26.458 --> 40:28.024
'cause we are creatives.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.727
Gimme an Instagram

40:30.729 --> 40:33.763
of a deep-fried Supreme sneaker,

40:33.765 --> 40:36.566
I'll give you one million
engagements.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.934
No big deal.

40:37.936 --> 40:42.539
I really admire and respect
what Dixie does.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.575
Because she gives me such
a good jumping off point

40:45.577 --> 40:47.076
for some of my memes.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.682
Yep. Yep.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.185
Like this image she created

40:55.187 --> 40:57.187
of these double-stuffed
cheese fries

40:57.189 --> 40:59.889
that have been fried again,
you know?

40:59.891 --> 41:02.058
See, I could take that,

41:02.060 --> 41:04.994
and I can make this meme like,

41:04.996 --> 41:07.497
"When your girl makes salmon,
but you all you crave

41:07.499 --> 41:10.133
are those double-stuffed
triple-fried cheese fries."

41:10.135 --> 41:12.936
[gasps] Wow.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.206
Did you see that?

41:16.208 --> 41:19.642
I owe a good amount of my posts
to Dixie.

41:19.644 --> 41:23.880
-Oh, stop it.
-Mm-hm. [chuckles]

41:23.882 --> 41:27.484
Kap and I, we just go...
we go way back.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.888
[both laugh]

41:31.890 --> 41:33.690
[both sigh]

41:33.692 --> 41:35.992
You know, we still collaborate.

41:35.994 --> 41:39.662
I mean, it's a process.
It's a workshop.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.799
-Kap said that.
-Mm-hm.

41:42.801 --> 41:47.537
And Kap just has a massive...

41:49.040 --> 41:50.707
following.

41:52.511 --> 41:55.044
And he always-- you know, he...
he credits us

41:55.046 --> 41:58.081
and tags us whenever
he uses our creations.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.084
As I should. Hm.

42:01.086 --> 42:06.289
When you are collaborating
on work of this nature,

42:06.291 --> 42:10.960
it is just, honestly,
almost impossible... [laughs]

42:10.962 --> 42:14.564
for things not to get...

42:15.667 --> 42:17.667
personal.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.770
We've had sex.

42:20.772 --> 42:24.574
Love between social media
influencers

42:24.576 --> 42:26.910
is really my bread and butter.

42:26.912 --> 42:32.015
<i> Social Submission</i> was no doubt
a turning point in my career.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.551
It was an erotic novel

42:34.553 --> 42:37.954
that was a passion project
of mine for quite some time.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.989
Sorry.

42:42.594 --> 42:45.295
The two characters, or lovers,

42:45.297 --> 42:47.130
as I'd more accurately
call them,

42:47.132 --> 42:48.898
um, never actually meet.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.701
Yet they share a, um...

42:54.839 --> 42:58.007
a sensual kind of bond

42:58.009 --> 43:00.743
that all the social platforms,

43:00.745 --> 43:03.346
the many different ways
they allow you to engage,

43:03.348 --> 43:05.848
only make more titillating.

43:05.850 --> 43:09.919
And I was just astounded
at the reception it received.

43:09.921 --> 43:14.824
I have never thought myself
an expert on the couples space.

43:14.826 --> 43:18.695
Um, but it led me to write
a second book,

43:18.697 --> 43:23.032
to major fanfare,
entitled <i> Touching...</i>

43:24.736 --> 43:26.970
<i> Without Touching.</i>

43:28.873 --> 43:32.675
This was more a nonfiction
self-help book

43:32.677 --> 43:35.912
for those that
are more concentrated,

43:35.914 --> 43:39.816
focused on cyber-sexuality
via social media,

43:39.818 --> 43:43.953
versus physical sexuality,
which many, including myself,

43:43.955 --> 43:46.356
would now say
is highly overrated.

43:47.392 --> 43:50.393
And this led to major notoriety

43:50.395 --> 43:54.897
and some pretty incredible
speaking engagements.

43:54.899 --> 43:59.869
Anonymous would have you believe
that a female or male's

43:59.871 --> 44:04.207
basic erogenous zones
are areas such as

44:04.209 --> 44:08.311
the ears, the cervix,
the neck, what have you.

44:08.313 --> 44:14.017
An area I proffer
they have overlooked...

44:18.323 --> 44:21.791
is the fingertips...

44:21.793 --> 44:24.260
i.e. the area through which

44:24.262 --> 44:28.331
all social media activity
stems from.

44:28.333 --> 44:34.170
The eyes, the windows through
which we see everything,

44:34.172 --> 44:40.376
um, such as a tawdry engagement
on Instagram.

44:40.378 --> 44:44.747
Or a lewd post on Facebook.

44:50.055 --> 44:53.456
[applause]

44:55.093 --> 44:57.927
When I started my practice,
I by no means

44:57.929 --> 45:00.096
had given any thought
to couples counseling.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.365
And I only counsel
influencer couples.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.200
That's my specialty.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.269
Because I came to realize
these partnerships

45:06.271 --> 45:08.438
can be quite volatile.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.908
Everything's fine until one
party experiences an uptick

45:11.910 --> 45:13.376
in his or her following,

45:13.378 --> 45:16.045
and then the honeymoon phase
is over.

45:16.047 --> 45:18.147
Which is a real shame,

45:18.149 --> 45:20.349
because honeymoons are
a terrific opportunity

45:20.351 --> 45:22.852
for viral posts on social media.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.822
I just unpacked
this amazing blue dress,

45:25.824 --> 45:28.324
and I am so excited about it.

45:28.326 --> 45:30.259
-I think it makes--
-Hey...

45:30.261 --> 45:32.995
-Uh-oh! Hey!
-Uh-oh!

45:32.997 --> 45:35.898
You have to suffer for your art
if you want the shot

45:35.900 --> 45:37.366
that's gonna break the world.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.973
Just a swipe on the cheek.
A swipe on the other cheek.

45:43.975 --> 45:45.208
A little bit
on the forehead here.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.876
Maybe a dab on the chin.

45:46.878 --> 45:51.047
What's cooking in the kitchen?
Oh! Sneak peek. Bam!

45:51.049 --> 45:52.849
-There we are.
-There's little old me too.

45:52.851 --> 45:54.484
-Look at that.
-We love you guys.

45:54.486 --> 45:56.152
And we love each other more.

45:56.154 --> 45:59.522
[Spacelli] Okay. Mika.

45:59.524 --> 46:02.225
Can you try and explain
what happened one more time?

46:02.227 --> 46:06.262
-Just a little bit calmer.
-Sure.

46:06.264 --> 46:11.000
Um, let me just
take myself there again.

46:12.403 --> 46:17.240
I had taken a photo
of room service on my phone.

46:17.242 --> 46:20.076
With a beautiful backdrop
of the fireplace.

46:20.078 --> 46:24.080
And Kingston asked me,
incredibly casually,

46:24.082 --> 46:26.916
if I could text it to him.

46:26.918 --> 46:30.953
I assumed he wanted it as a
memento of our vacation.

46:32.824 --> 46:35.424
[Spacelli] Go on.

46:35.426 --> 46:39.428
So we go to dinner that night.

46:39.430 --> 46:41.798
And everything was normal.

46:41.800 --> 46:45.301
Same with, uh, sex.

46:45.303 --> 46:49.005
Everything was, um... fine.

46:49.007 --> 46:51.407
So then I wake up.

46:52.410 --> 46:54.377
And...

46:58.917 --> 47:02.185
Kingston had posted the photo
to his Instagram account.

47:05.857 --> 47:08.491
-Did he tag you?
-No.

47:08.493 --> 47:11.260
He didn't.

47:11.262 --> 47:13.429
And what did Kingston say
when you confronted him?

47:13.431 --> 47:16.432
Well, let's see.
He offered to take it down.

47:16.434 --> 47:17.884
But I think at that point,

47:17.885 --> 47:19.335
he knew that those
were empty words.

47:19.337 --> 47:22.138
I mean, the damage
was astronomical.

47:22.140 --> 47:24.106
It was already up
to 300,000 likes,

47:24.108 --> 47:27.410
4,000 comments, I mean, poof!
Gone.

47:27.412 --> 47:30.379
I truly didn't think that she
was planning on posting it.

47:30.381 --> 47:33.850
Okay? She had already done
a breakfast shot that trip,

47:33.852 --> 47:37.486
and I mean, yes, yes, yes! Yes,
it was a little bit different.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.390
-But it was still eggs.
-Okay.

47:41.392 --> 47:44.093
You know,
you have two egg shots,

47:44.095 --> 47:46.195
like right next to each other.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.631
I mean, I don't know. It just,
it looks a little lazy.

47:48.633 --> 47:50.366
-Are you kidding me?
-I think it looks lazy.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.435
-Are you kidding me?
-What is this, Andy Warhol?

47:52.437 --> 47:54.437
This is unbelievable.
If you had seen it,

47:54.439 --> 47:57.240
the first breakfast photo was
a completely different filter,

47:57.242 --> 48:00.109
ambience, theme entirely.
Unbelievable.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.278
Yeah, but they're both
sunnyside up. So...

48:02.280 --> 48:04.013
I'm done. I'm done.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.315
You can slap all the brightness
filters you want on it.

48:06.317 --> 48:08.251
-It's still sunnyside up.
-You didn't know how

48:08.253 --> 48:10.253
I was going to frame it, okay?
The way I frame things

48:10.255 --> 48:11.921
is different from the way
you frame things.

48:11.923 --> 48:13.389
Maybe in that moment,

48:13.391 --> 48:15.625
while you were acting
from an artistic place,

48:15.627 --> 48:18.127
which I totally respect,

48:18.129 --> 48:21.264
maybe there's a way
to deliver that information

48:21.266 --> 48:24.033
to Mika personally, which I know
this sounds strange,

48:24.035 --> 48:25.902
but without posting it.

48:25.904 --> 48:29.005
Maybe tell her how you feel
about two eggs being posted

48:29.007 --> 48:31.140
at the same time, don't just
assume she knows.

48:31.142 --> 48:34.243
I was going to tag you
when I posted it.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.646
I would have tagged you
in the photo

48:36.648 --> 48:38.381
-that you would post.
-I'm not an egg.

48:38.383 --> 48:41.651
Kingston, do you generally
post food photos?

48:43.421 --> 48:46.923
Well, I have a little bit more
recently.

48:46.925 --> 48:50.059
Um, I have a very,
very specific diet,

48:50.061 --> 48:52.561
very special kind of diet.
It's the keto diet.

48:52.563 --> 48:54.931
I don't know if you've...
you've heard about this?

48:54.933 --> 48:57.099
Well, it's... it's
a little exciting,

48:57.101 --> 49:00.102
it's a little novel,
it's very en vogue right now.

49:00.104 --> 49:03.973
No carbs, all fats. Okay?
All fats and proteins.

49:03.975 --> 49:06.142
Very high in fat and protein.
So a lot of cheese.

49:06.144 --> 49:08.678
-A lot of, um, you know...
-Would you say...

49:08.680 --> 49:11.213
And Mika, I do not say this
to hurt you.

49:11.215 --> 49:13.316
Would you say eggs?

49:13.318 --> 49:15.251
-Do you post eggs?
-Well, yeah.

49:15.252 --> 49:17.185
Well, that's the thing.
'Cause eggs are on this diet.

49:17.188 --> 49:19.455
I can show grace for that.
I will show you grace.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.257
Thank you.

49:21.259 --> 49:24.060
Kingston, did you hear that?
Mika wants to show you grace.

49:24.062 --> 49:27.263
-Uh-huh.
-Mika?

49:27.265 --> 49:30.166
I think maybe you could
show Kingston snacks.

49:31.369 --> 49:33.402
Like photos of snacks?

49:33.404 --> 49:35.004
[Kingston] I feel like that's
just gonna make it worse.

49:35.006 --> 49:37.173
Maybe actual snacks.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.976
Maybe you could
explore this diet,

49:39.978 --> 49:42.311
find appropriate snacks,
and in that way

49:42.313 --> 49:44.981
participate with Kingston
in this experiment.

49:44.983 --> 49:47.416
This is a creative endeavor
you can do together.

49:47.418 --> 49:50.086
Like cooking?

49:50.088 --> 49:52.054
I wouldn't go that far.
You could probably order it.

49:52.056 --> 49:53.589
-Oh, good, good.
-Like Seamless, I don't wanna...

49:53.591 --> 49:56.559
-Okay, yeah. Thank you.
-You can do that on your phone.

49:56.561 --> 49:59.295
-I have an idea.
-I'd love for you to share it.

49:59.297 --> 50:03.332
I think, um, sometimes
I've seen some couples

50:03.334 --> 50:06.135
do a time out symbol.
Like, time out.

50:06.137 --> 50:08.537
Let's take a breather.
And I'm thinking,

50:08.539 --> 50:11.273
what if...

50:11.275 --> 50:12.508
What if we did a hashtag?

50:13.611 --> 50:16.212
Like hashtag, take a breather.

50:16.214 --> 50:18.147
-Hashtag...
-I feel like Kingston's

50:18.149 --> 50:20.583
-thinking about this.
-Yeah. Yeah.

50:20.585 --> 50:23.719
-Are you open, babe?
-Yeah, I'm open.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.222
I'm open to talking about that,
the "take a breather."

50:26.224 --> 50:28.190
I mean, I did that with my,
you know,

50:28.192 --> 50:30.526
my asthma awareness campaign.
So we might have to kind of

50:30.528 --> 50:33.162
-switch that up a little bit.
-I forgot about that.

50:33.164 --> 50:35.297
-That's right.
-I will say that tagging

50:35.299 --> 50:37.733
is something that I think
we need to explore further

50:37.735 --> 50:40.169
-in our sessions.
-Thank you.

50:40.170 --> 50:42.604
And each person's definition
of how that is acceptable

50:42.607 --> 50:46.175
is different. You're not wrong,
you're not wrong.

50:46.177 --> 50:48.310
But we're going to have to find
a place in the middle.

50:48.312 --> 50:51.080
Yes, I think that,
about me not being wrong,

50:51.082 --> 50:53.549
is a good...
is a good take away.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.252
-Us. Us not being wrong.
-Us not-- us not being wrong.

50:56.254 --> 50:59.688
I would never question
the sex lives

50:59.690 --> 51:02.491
of these influencer couples,

51:02.493 --> 51:07.463
who are just all so ever present
in all the social platforms.

51:07.465 --> 51:10.199
I think, as...

51:11.736 --> 51:15.638
Kama Sutra was to the '70s,

51:15.640 --> 51:18.307
they are to the 21st century.

51:18.309 --> 51:22.478
They hold
the hidden keys to a...

51:24.382 --> 51:28.784
deeper, more profound
exploration of sexuality

51:28.786 --> 51:30.586
as we know it.

51:30.588 --> 51:34.390
Well, we've been married
for about two years?

51:34.392 --> 51:36.292
-Two years, yeah.
-Yeah.

51:36.293 --> 51:38.193
-We actually met on Instagram.
-Yeah, it was very kismet.

51:38.196 --> 51:40.629
-Yeah.
-You know, very meant to be,

51:40.631 --> 51:45.101
Romeo and Juliet, stars aligning
kind of feel to it.

51:45.103 --> 51:46.502
We coincidentally both were
at Coachella.

51:46.504 --> 51:48.771
Yeah. Of course, I knew
who Kingston was.

51:48.773 --> 51:51.107
I was following him.
He wasn't following me.

51:51.109 --> 51:53.476
But I was following him.
He didn't know that, though.

51:53.478 --> 51:56.479
-I have a lot of followers.
-Yeah. Yes, he does.

51:56.481 --> 51:59.582
He sure does.
He's got a lot of followers.

51:59.584 --> 52:01.517
I do!

52:01.519 --> 52:03.652
I commented on
an Instagram of his

52:03.654 --> 52:06.789
that just really...

52:06.791 --> 52:07.857
spoke to me.

52:07.859 --> 52:09.525
[Kingston] I was rolling
at the time.

52:09.527 --> 52:11.210
[Mika] Yeah.

52:11.211 --> 52:12.894
-And then he just pounced.
-Oh, I pounced.

52:12.897 --> 52:15.164
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Full on. Yeah.

52:15.166 --> 52:17.299
He DM'd me, of course.

52:17.301 --> 52:19.568
And it began.

52:19.570 --> 52:23.239
We commented, we liked,
we pinged, we DM'd.

52:23.241 --> 52:25.341
Like back and forth
for just eight months.

52:25.343 --> 52:29.345
Yeah. We actually didn't meet
at that Coachella physically.

52:29.347 --> 52:33.182
We only met eight months later,
coincidentally at another event.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.683
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

52:34.685 --> 52:36.318
-But those eight months...
-Best eight months of my life.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.155
-Aw! Mine too.
-Oh?

52:39.157 --> 52:43.192
The whole marriage angle
is great for social media.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.728
It's the whole reason we're
in <i> The National Influencer's</i>

52:45.730 --> 52:49.431
anniversary issue, even though
our follower counts

52:49.433 --> 52:53.469
aren't quite up there
as the other influencers

52:53.471 --> 52:56.338
-who get to be on the cover.
-Yeah.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.742
Uh, just to be in the issue...

52:59.744 --> 53:01.410
-Not on the cover, though.
-Yeah.

53:01.412 --> 53:02.578
-So that's...
-It's okay.

53:02.580 --> 53:05.714
Yeah, no, just us
and a French bulldog.

53:05.716 --> 53:07.516
-[laughs] Who we love.
-Side by side.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.218
Whom we love. We do love.

53:09.220 --> 53:12.488
I will say that we did notice,
when we got married,

53:12.490 --> 53:14.857
we were able to merge
our follower counts

53:14.859 --> 53:17.193
-to create this bigger number.
-Mm-hm.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.862
Which was very exciting.
I mean, after he proposed,

53:19.864 --> 53:22.731
our post-engagement post
engagement just skyrocketed.

53:22.733 --> 53:23.933
We're always working
on the relationship.

53:23.935 --> 53:26.269
-Yes.
-Always looking for ways

53:26.270 --> 53:28.604
to up each other's followings,
you know, support each other.

53:28.606 --> 53:30.639
I would say that social media's
a really good barometer

53:30.641 --> 53:32.608
for whatever is going on
inside the relationship.

53:32.610 --> 53:34.610
Yeah, we always wonder what
other couples fight about.

53:34.612 --> 53:36.445
[laughs] Yeah. Like,
what else is there?

53:36.447 --> 53:38.681
-Uh-huh.
-Are you doing a...

53:38.683 --> 53:40.449
an Instagram Live of this
right now?

53:40.451 --> 53:41.750
Oh, yeah, babe,
it's right behind you.

53:41.752 --> 53:42.851
Oh. Thank God.

[Ava] <i> With social media,</i>
<i> these influencers</i>

53:50.461 --> 53:52.928
<i> have found new ways,</i>
<i> not only to connect,</i>

53:52.930 --> 53:55.264
<i> but to communicate.</i>

53:55.266 --> 53:58.500
[Mia] <i> There are so many ways</i>

53:58.502 --> 54:02.271
<i> and who you are now.</i>

54:02.273 --> 54:04.373
<i> It's self branding.</i>

54:04.375 --> 54:07.376

54:07.378 --> 54:11.914

54:11.916 --> 54:15.584

54:15.586 --> 54:17.720

54:17.722 --> 54:21.957
And the complete and total
dedication to their craft.

54:21.959 --> 54:23.626
It's a case of perfectionism.

54:23.628 --> 54:26.462
<i> Pure, unadulterated</i>
<i> perfectionism.</i>

54:28.266 --> 54:30.032

-Oh.

54:48.919 --> 54:51.654
That's also my clementine.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.723
In my hand.

54:55.293 --> 54:56.659
Off you go.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.960
Hip, hip!

55:04.568 --> 55:07.603
Boom! Good one. Got it!

55:08.606 --> 55:09.972
Oh, hey, Francesca?

55:09.974 --> 55:12.675
Francesca, let me get
a green tea latte,

55:12.677 --> 55:15.444
cashew milk, three straws,
hold the cup. Okay?

55:16.013 --> 55:17.880
Jane.

55:17.882 --> 55:19.581
Grande latte.

55:19.583 --> 55:21.684
Four straws, hold the milk.

55:21.686 --> 55:23.452
Hold the straws.

55:23.454 --> 55:26.021
Benjamin, we're gonna get some
behind-the-scenes shots, okay?

55:27.458 --> 55:29.725
Can we move this?

55:29.727 --> 55:31.393
I'm gonna move this.

55:32.530 --> 55:35.097
Excuse me, sir.
You're in my way.

55:35.099 --> 55:37.566
What am I wearing?
I'll be honest,

55:37.568 --> 55:40.035
I find this garment
incredibly disorienting.

55:40.037 --> 55:43.872
I put my legs through and I
found out they were in one...

55:43.874 --> 55:46.342
one hole and there
was a whole other hole

55:46.344 --> 55:48.944
that was empty.
What's that supposed to be for?

55:48.946 --> 55:52.014
I just guess I put
my leg in each one and...

55:52.016 --> 55:54.817
It feels wrong, though.
What do you think, babe?

55:54.819 --> 55:56.919
No. That looks really
uncomfortable.

55:56.921 --> 55:58.921
Do you have anything else, sir?

55:58.923 --> 56:01.056
Yeah, I mean, I actually
might've saved the day here

56:01.058 --> 56:03.926
'cause I brought this,
which is my chef jacket

56:03.928 --> 56:05.928
which I wear every day,
but this one's a formal one.

56:05.930 --> 56:09.465
It's pink. I mean, of course,
I wanna respect your vision,

56:09.467 --> 56:12.000
so, you know, you have final
approval, of course.

56:12.002 --> 56:15.604
But I approve it. We could even
leave some of these buttons open

56:15.606 --> 56:17.039
to show some of the slip
underneath,

56:17.041 --> 56:18.541
if that's what you like.

56:18.542 --> 56:20.042
I wanna respect your vision,
as I said.

56:20.044 --> 56:21.777
But I'm just gonna button
all this up.

56:21.779 --> 56:23.912
Button it right up to the top
so you can't see

56:23.914 --> 56:25.714
what you dressed me in.

56:25.716 --> 56:29.518
I'd say, though, we keep it,
we keep the slip underneath,

56:29.520 --> 56:33.489
but then we scrap it and we put
the jeans that I brought,

56:33.491 --> 56:37.459
put this on top,
so just to...

56:37.461 --> 56:40.929
to recap,
we have everything I brought

56:40.931 --> 56:43.932
and we're not using anything
that you suggested.

56:43.934 --> 56:45.984
We're just trying
to stay calm here.

56:45.985 --> 56:48.035
You know, I'm calm,
she's calm. Everybody is calm.

56:48.038 --> 56:50.606
Yeah. You have said you're
calm a few times.

56:50.608 --> 56:52.975
Well, I am calm.
My hands are shaking,

56:52.977 --> 56:56.545
but my mind is calm
as a whistle.

56:56.547 --> 56:58.147
No, it's "clean as a whistle."
Good, okay.

56:58.149 --> 57:00.682
To be honest,
we weren't fully aware

57:00.684 --> 57:03.952
of what came with all of them
under one roof in one space.

57:03.954 --> 57:07.756
We're used to tackling them
individually, one by one.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.793
-Just keep your voice down.
-Sorry. Sorry.

57:11.996 --> 57:13.429
They're vicious people.

57:13.431 --> 57:15.597
They're an eccentric group
of people I'd say.

57:15.599 --> 57:17.699
I can't feel this half down.
I can't feel it.

57:17.701 --> 57:19.101
I can't feel my legs
and I'm sure that's normal.

57:19.103 --> 57:21.203
Oh, it's gonna be
an amazing day, right?

57:21.205 --> 57:23.772
We have what most would call
I'd say the five pillars

57:23.774 --> 57:25.674
of society right now.

57:25.676 --> 57:28.043
We've got your meme god,
Kap Phat Jawacki.

57:28.045 --> 57:29.678
Your food YouTuber,
Dixie Bell.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.747
-Your vlogger, Jane Zap.
-She bit me.

57:31.749 --> 57:33.649
-She did not mean to.
-Yes, she did, she bit me.

57:33.651 --> 57:34.716
I tried to touch
one of her dogs,

57:34.718 --> 57:36.618
which don't do that.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.021
And she bit me. Not the dog,
the dog didn't bite me.

57:39.023 --> 57:42.658
The vlogger, the vlogger sank
her teeth right into me.

57:42.660 --> 57:45.661
We've got your star Snapchatter,
Dan Summers.

57:45.663 --> 57:46.829
Hasn't gotten here yet.

57:46.831 --> 57:48.931
But we're excited
to see how he's doing.

57:48.933 --> 57:50.999
-I don't think he's coming.
-And your fashion Instagram

57:51.001 --> 57:54.203
-star, Josie Z.
-You call this contouring?

57:54.205 --> 57:57.139
Where are my cheekbones? Ben!

57:57.141 --> 57:59.174
-She's spunky.
-Yeah. She's spunky.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.643
-She's lively.
-Vivacious.

58:01.645 --> 58:06.748
We and our makeup artist were
under the mistaken impression

58:06.750 --> 58:11.553
that makeup can only help
to accentuate one's cheekbones.

58:11.555 --> 58:14.723
Our mistake. 'Cause apparently,
like Rome,

58:14.725 --> 58:16.792
cheekbones can be built
from the ground up

58:16.794 --> 58:18.560
with the right makeup artist,
which was not first, second,

58:18.562 --> 58:19.828
third, or fourth one
we've had here today.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.196
I have a pretty good feeling
about the seventh

58:21.198 --> 58:22.931
-that we hired, though.
-She keeps saying something

58:22.933 --> 58:24.800
-about a ticking.
-Yes. Ticking.

58:24.802 --> 58:27.019
You know,
I don't hear a ticking.

58:27.020 --> 58:29.237
She doesn't hear a ticking.
None of us hear a ticking.

58:29.240 --> 58:32.174
But obviously, we are all saying
that we hear a ticking.

58:32.176 --> 58:36.178
And now I'm actually...
Yeah, there it goes again.

58:36.180 --> 58:39.581
I'm starting to hear
a ticking myself, so... yeah.

58:39.583 --> 58:42.251
-Well, there's...
-Get that checked out

58:42.253 --> 58:44.653
in my ample spare time
that I have.

58:44.655 --> 58:46.288
Tell them about prep.
Let's change the subject.

58:46.290 --> 58:48.223
Let's talk about prep.
Let's talk about prep.

58:48.225 --> 58:51.527
We are making sure to keep
separate any two influencers

58:51.529 --> 58:54.296
who might have a strong
following in the same platform,

58:54.298 --> 58:56.632
because that could be just
a little uncomfortable.

58:56.634 --> 58:59.735
So we put Jane Zap
and Josie Z together.

58:59.737 --> 59:02.938
And Dixie Bell and Kap together.

59:02.940 --> 59:07.009
Fat Ben Affleck! Santa Claus!
[laughs]

59:07.011 --> 59:09.978
-He's been doing that all day.
-Yeah, every 14 minutes or so,

59:09.980 --> 59:12.781
I'd say he yells out like a
certain combination of things.

59:12.783 --> 59:15.150
Sometimes it's an unhealthy
food item and a rapper,

59:15.152 --> 59:17.819
or, you know, a politician
and a porn star,

59:17.821 --> 59:19.655
and a character like
Kermit the Frog,

59:19.657 --> 59:21.757
Miss Piggy,
any of the Muppets really.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.191
He says it about cheese fries
a lot as well.

59:23.193 --> 59:25.227
-Yes, yes. He does.
-[Kap] Chili cheese fries!

59:25.229 --> 59:27.329
[Josie] Where is this ticking
coming from?

59:27.331 --> 59:29.831
I'm so sorry,
we're looking into it.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.667
-Go look into the ticking.
-There is no ticking.

59:31.669 --> 59:33.936
I know.
Just do what I did last time.

59:33.938 --> 59:36.138
Just get up, go the bathroom,
come back,

59:36.140 --> 59:38.073
and say you told the guys
to work on the ticking.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.175
Can I ask a question?
Who are the guys?

59:40.177 --> 59:41.944
-There's no guys.
-There are no guys.

59:41.946 --> 59:43.679
-Just... this is fake.
-There are no guys.

59:43.681 --> 59:45.914
-This is fake guys.
-Go get me a sandwich.

59:45.916 --> 59:48.584
-Guys?
-All right, thank you.

59:48.586 --> 59:49.985
Yes, I'd love it
to look like an egg.

59:49.987 --> 59:51.653
-I want the yolk...
-These people are completely

59:51.655 --> 59:53.622
incompetent,
they're like animals.

59:53.624 --> 59:56.325
One of them I heard was saying
something so stupid

59:56.327 --> 59:57.826
to the other one.
They're all stupid.

59:57.828 --> 59:59.728
Ben, you're so bad at gossiping.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.097
-Hey.
-Yes. Hi.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.033
-We're starting any minute now.
-Dan Summers is in the spread.

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:07.202
-That's what I was told.
-You were told correct, yes.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:08.870
He is in the spread.
He's just a little late.

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.206
Okay. See, that's what
I don't like to hear.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:14.676
If I took a picture of Cardi B,

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:17.913
and then I added the word
"delicious..." pow!

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:21.650
But then I got no picture
of a slice of pizza.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:25.220
Hm. What do you
think that means? You tell me.

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:27.789
I'm never good
at guessing games. Um...

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.092
-I'm trying to--
-It means the story's dead.

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:32.928
The meme dream is dead.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.197
No Dan, the no me, no story.
Okay?

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.733
He's the only one here
who is anywhere near me

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:40.068
in terms of follow count.
All right?

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.670
You got me taking a picture
with a vlogger

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:43.905
with only 10.1 million
followers!

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.941
I mean...

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:54.082
[laughs] That was her. [laughs]

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.418
-That was her. That was her.
-With the cats...

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.355
[laughing]

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:04.860
Now, it usually takes me like
a minute to catch up to Kap.

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.429
And, uh, I'm caught up now.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:11.299
So is Dan Summers not coming?

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.068
'Cause I thought he
was gonna be here.

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.470
-Here's the thing about Dan
-They're trying to pull

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:15.871
-something on us, babe.
-What's going on?

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:17.139
The guys are looking
into the ticking.

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:19.675
-Ugh, thank God.
-Where is Dan?

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.209
Oh, Dan's coming.
He's just a little late.

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:23.211
-Right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.313
He's two hours late.

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:28.383
And if he's not in this,
then I am not in this.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.085
Yeah.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:34.022
If he's not in this,
she's not in this whole thing.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.827
I hate memes.

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:41.763
She doesn't care
for your memes, man.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:44.366
And I don't like girls named
after country music bands.

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:47.002
-Yeah, fuck you.
-Don't even get me started

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:52.441
-on animal kingdom over there.
-Animal kingdom. Classic.

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:54.376
[sobbing]

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.311
[Josie] Is that the ticking?
What is that?

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:59.014
-[sobbing]
-Oh, my God.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:01.850
-What a waste of food.
-Now I gotta listen to that

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:04.986
and the ticking?
This is truly my hell.

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:06.922
I mean, honestly,
I hate to agree

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:11.259
with this very bitter,
strange lady.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.328
But, I mean,
is he coming or not?

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.996
Because I could be--
You know, I could be

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:16.832
-frying something right now.
-Yes.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:20.068
Yes, baby, you could.
You could be. She could.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.271
Well, we-- we haven't heard
from him.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.873
-But he said--
-They haven't heard from him.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:28.243
-They haven't heard from him.
-[groans] I'm out.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:32.414
Boom! Oh! Me too!

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.967
I don't know what they're doing
with their hands.

01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:37.519
Come on, Ben, let's go.
This is a waste of our time.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:40.388
Ooh!

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.024
Now you're in trouble
with Josie now.

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:45.827
Benjamin, what did I tell you
about engaging in conversations

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:48.230
-that I am not a part of?
-She said under

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:51.032
no circumstances ever.

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:56.404
You know what?
I hope you're all happy.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:03:00.041
But more importantly,
I hope one day I am happy!

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:02.844
[music plays]

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:20.095
So Dan Summers never showed up
to the photo shoot.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:22.130
-No, he did not.
-Yeah.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.367
But he did leave us a message
to explain why he wasn't there.

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:29.204
Not a text message, he left
this message on a VHS tape.

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:31.006
Do you know anyone
with a VHS player?

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.841
-Because we do not.
-No. We don't.

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.910
We searched everywhere.
We searched on eBay.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.278
-Craigslist.
-Pawn shops.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.380
Even checked with both sets
of grandparents,

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:40.949
and got laughed right out
of Shore Hills. Embarrassing.

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.451
As a journalist, you do
have to follow the story.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:46.855
So we went back
to see Dan Summers again

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:48.323
to get some answers.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.326
We wanted to tell his story.
Whatever it was.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.295
-However bleak it was.
-Yeah.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.529
We wanted to give him that.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.565
[doorbell rings]

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:59.334
<i> Unfortunately, though,</i>

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.436
<i> -Dan had disappeared.</i>
-...disappeared.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.338
<i>He'd gone in search of answers.</i>

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:11.513
<i> We found a note that he left.</i>

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:16.284
<i> But it was very hard</i>
<i> to make out the words.</i>

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:19.554
<i> We believe it said</i>
<i> "back to the source."</i>

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:24.326
<i> Dan Summers went totally</i>
<i> off the grid.</i>

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:26.394
<i> But more importantly, though,</i>

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.331
<i> he did what so many of us</i>
<i> cannot do.</i>

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:32.167
<i> He went on a personal journey</i>

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:34.569
<i> just completely unplugged.</i>

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.074
<i> We soon discovered he actually</i>
<i> had our intern Andy</i>

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:40.876
-go with him, though.
-Makes sense.

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.111
I mean, if you are going
to successfully unplug

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:45.280
or do a tech detox, you've
simply got to share that

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:47.649
-on social media.
-Oh, it would be a crime not to.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:50.218
The point is Dan himself
is not physically carrying

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.320
a phone or a tablet
on this journey.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:55.523
No. Unless something happens
to Andy.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:57.893
Yeah. Something happens to Andy,
we would expect that Dan

01:04:57.895 --> 01:05:00.495
would have to bring
the tablets back. Yeah.

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:02.330
-Would be a win-win.
-Oh, yeah.

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:11.940
[man] Come in!

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:22.584
-Dan Summers?
-Yes.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.987
-I've been expecting you.
-You know who I am.

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:27.956
I know all my chosen ones.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.991
Your-- your chosen ones?

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:32.093
Anyone with more
than ten million followers

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:34.195
-on any given platform.
-Obviously, I haven't

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:35.664
-checked my Snapchat lately.
-Oh, please.

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.632
We all lose our way.

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.501
But what goes down
must come up.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:41.403
Especially on Snapchat.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:50.712
-So what can I do for you?
-You are the Architect.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:52.280
The Architect behind the
inception of social media

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.115
since the dawn of it,
since MySpace.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.216
Don't mention MySpace.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.452
But yes.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.954
That is who I am.

01:06:00.324 --> 01:06:02.691
You know, it's about time
<i> The National Influencer</i>

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:04.960
-covered me.
-Of course.

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:06.695
They'll cover any millennial
Joe, Dick, or Harry

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:08.697
worth a tablet.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:13.335
But the one who started it all,
the one whose inception it was,

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:17.339
the Architect,
as you so beautifully put it...

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.008
-no.
-To be fair,

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.176
I'm not really sure
they know who you are.

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:22.644
You know, it's typical

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:26.548
that they should come to me
through you.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.583
Ageists.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.619
But I digress.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:34.656
So...

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:38.326
what do you wanna know?

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.030
I wanna know why.

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.465
Why what, Dan?

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.333
Why are we on social media?

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.068
Why did it all begin?

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.271
You've engineered all of this,
but why?

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:53.208
Well, you might as well
ask why do we breathe?

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.210
Oh.

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:58.279
To tell you the truth, Dan,

01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:00.148
I don't like people.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.752
I don't like interacting
with people in person.

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:05.487
-Mm-hm.
-And confrontation.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:07.655
Who likes confrontation?

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:11.493
Physical confrontation
makes me nervous.

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:14.262
-Right, right.
-I mean, if my ex-wife

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.631
cheats on me,
and then she goes on vacation

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.800
with her new husband,
I think it's easier

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:21.036
to write a nasty comment
on her wall

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:22.704
than to call her up
on the telephone,

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.706
or God forbid you confront her
in person.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.076
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That's... that's off the record,

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:31.046
-that last part.
-Sure.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.580
Do I talk to you
or do I talk to them?

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:35.050
Oh, no, no.
You can just talk to me.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.351
Okay.

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:40.688
I wanted to engineer
a kind of a chasm,

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.458
a chasm where people
were... they were linked,

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.760
not through physical
interaction,

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:49.097
but rather through digital ones.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:51.566
Okay? I mean, that's
where the world is going!

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.369
Who wants to live
in a physical world

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:56.838
like we're living in today? No!

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:02.410
Dan, the future
is a digital existence!

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:07.215
Okay, but isn't it the physical
that makes us human beings?

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:09.384
No.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.653
No, I think if you pick up
a copy of Sheila Burger's

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.254
<i> Touching Without Touching,</i>

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:16.357
you will realize
that it is quite oppositely

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.526
not about the physical.

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:21.229
We're engaging with each other

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:23.798
wholly and entirely,
body and soul,

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.167
via social media.

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:27.435
But what if I want both?

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:32.340
You know, to be both
a chosen one,

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.343
but also a physical human being.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.444
Do you wanna live in a world
where one minute

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.514
you're the host
of <i> Celebrity Apprentice</i>

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:41.683
and the next minute you're
the most powerful man

01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:45.120
in the world, where one minute
you're OJ Simpson's lawyer,

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.287
and the next minute
you're the patriarch

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:51.759
of the most televised family
in the history of the medium?

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:54.261
Where one minute you have a wife

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:55.897
and you have
a Labrador retriever,

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.867
and the next minute
she takes the house

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.435
and the dog and the Lexus--

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:03.270
Yeah, no, I get it.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:06.875
-I digress.
-Yes, you do. Quite often.

01:09:06.877 --> 01:09:09.810
But can I ask you...

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.779
Can I have both?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.149
No, Dan.

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:19.720
Do you really wanna live
physically

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:22.724
in the world we live in today?

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.727
I'm offering you a key.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:27.462
The chance to escape.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:31.832
My chosen ones will be
the first to depart

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.602
from this physical world.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:37.238
And the rest will follow.

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:44.479
-Yeah... no.
-What?

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:45.846
-I can't do that.
-Yes, you can.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:51.352
Um, I'm sorry. I just--
I can't help you.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.390
I have to stay.

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:59.627
And I have to save what's left

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:01.563
of the real.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.433
Thank you.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.635
No, Dan.
Dan, you're missing my point.

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.738
-Dan, listen. Dan, Dan.
-Yeah?

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:16.377
Amazon has gotten so big.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.613
-Okay.
-I can't wrap

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:21.449
my brain around it.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.551
Yeah, I mean, the brand
is definitely--

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:26.921
I-- please, sit.
Because I can't understand it.

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:29.357
And I need to talk
to somebody about this.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:31.893
Okay, sure, but I do
have to leave before three.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.861
And Alexa, talking to you
in your home.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:37.699
Because she can
walk your dog virtually.

01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:39.934
-No. No, she can't.
-Yes, she can.

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:43.271
-No!
-Dan, she can.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.939
Where are you reading
any of this?

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:48.710
Memes.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:50.712
I've been scrolling
through memes.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:54.249
And there's this vlogger,
Jane Zap.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:57.619
I don't know-- she has the most
adorable videos of cats.

01:10:57.621 --> 01:11:00.822
Little cats and kittens.
And she dresses them all up.

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.624
And some of them go to the prom,

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:04.993
and some of them
are on a cakewalk,

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:06.728
-and it's charming.
-I have to go.

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:10.598
But if I continue talking
about Jane Zap...

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.600
-I'll go faster.
-Okay.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:16.037
Um, thank you so much.
It's been a pleasure.

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:18.473
-The pleasure's all mine.
-You'll email me, yes?

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:22.310
-Email? Wow.
-Godspeed.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:24.279
Yeah, I'll email you. Okay?
I'll email you.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.914
You do good work.
And you know I'm right.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:29.951
-Maybe.
-Don't you argue with me, Dan.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:31.452
-Bye-bye.
-Have a good one.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.426
Can I help you with something?

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:43.331
Just... yeah.

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.701
-Good?
-Sorry. One more.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.638
Thanks so much.
Love your work.

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:53.074
Tag me!

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.877
[music plays]

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.082
Once I found out the Architect's
plan was to turn us all

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:36.517
into digital bots,

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.387
switching from the physical
completely to the digital,

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:41.856
I felt I had to step in.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:45.993
To warn the other influencers
to do something.

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:49.630
They had to be the ones
to lead the way.

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:52.066
So I started a franchise
of workshops

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:54.902
entitled PICW:

01:12:54.904 --> 01:13:00.508
Physical Interaction
and Communication Workshops.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.944
What's great about Dan's
Physical Interaction

01:13:02.946 --> 01:13:05.913
and Communication Workshops?
Hm.

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:09.617
-It's a mouthful.
-[laughs] Yes. Yes, it is.

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:13.521
Well, what's great about them
is that bae and I...

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:17.759
Mm. I mean Dixie and I,
because that's her name,

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.061
you know, that's the name
her mama gave her.

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:22.096
-After the cup.
-Hm.

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:26.901
Dixie and I, well, we're
learning to communicate

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:31.172
with each other in new
and authentic ways.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.107
Taking what we have
going on here

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:34.609
to the next level.

01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:37.445
Yep.

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:41.149
-What's the next level?
-Yeah, I'm not sure. You know?

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:43.418
But it's there. Whoo!

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.154
It's a level, for sure.

01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:49.724
Because it's not
about the memes

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:51.959
or the captions or the food.
Mm-mm.

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:54.028
-No.
-Mm-mm-mm...

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.598
[both] Mm-mm-mm-mm.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.834
-It's about us.
-Mm-hm. Yep.

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:02.203
That's just what I was gonna
say. Word for word.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:04.572
Kap, communicate.
[clicks tongue]

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:05.740
Where do you see this going
with Dixie?

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:09.444
Yeah, where do you see
this going?

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:11.946
I see it going...

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.781
There's like
a picture of a goat,

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.752
and then some sort of variation
on a pear.

01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:19.787
Ariana Grande!

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.689
-Wow.
-Kap, what we talked about.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:24.826
Okay?
How we practiced it.

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:28.963
Okay. Okay, baby.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.898
Take those fucking stupid
glasses off.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.900
Yeah. I should take them off.

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:35.837
Dixie... [clears throat]

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:41.008
Dixie, I see this going...

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.578
to a place.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.150
Wow. A place.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:52.587
-Yeah.
-As I'd planned all along,

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.923
whatever epiphany I made
by going back to the source,

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:59.594
that would ideally be
the new group cover story

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:02.129
for <i> The National Influencer's</i>
fifth anniversary issue.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:04.632
That message was lost
in translation.

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:07.168
Well, not technically lost
in translation.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.504
Lost on a VHS tape.

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:11.906
-But still.
-My ball!

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:20.114
It works.

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:23.184
For this next round,
no hands.

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.686
Speak the ball into your
partner's existence.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:28.956
-I trust you.
-I trust you. Okay?

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.224
Now, fall.

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:37.698
-That's a little bit scary.
-It is.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.166
-Scary's good.
-Okay.

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.303
I trust you.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:50.645
Dan's movement has really
reminded me to be more mindful

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:52.680
of "people."

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:56.117
They're people.
They're not just followers.

01:15:56.119 --> 01:15:57.785
[laughs]

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:02.156
And I'm learning to let go
of a lot of my rage.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.926
Both for myself

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:07.995
-and per the court's request.
-Stupid judge.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:11.132
I have become
so much more aware

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:14.235
of how my actions affect others.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:17.071
-Influencers are people.
-Who knew?

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.273
I mean, what Dan has done
is amazing.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.242
Yeah, amazing, and as he had
planned all along,

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:24.579
we were making this story,
these PICW groups,

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:26.013
the new cover
of the anniversary issue.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:29.350
The entire issue is dedicated
to this topic.

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:31.752
You can tell them.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.020
We pushed Fifi the Frenchie.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:34.221
Which we did not feel bad about.

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:36.057
No, neither of us did.
She was just...

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:38.192
She was very arrogant.
Don't you think?

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.061
-Very. Um...
-Yeah.

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:42.330
We were just perplexed
because Dan had put this

01:16:42.332 --> 01:16:44.065
message out to all
the influencers,

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:46.417
and started this whole movement

01:16:46.418 --> 01:16:48.768
and we just heard nothing
from her. Not a word.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:53.140
She went on posting exactly
as she had been.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:54.709
And that just rubbed us
the wrong way.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:56.978
-There's no excuse for that.
-No. It...

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.946
You know, to be that
out of touch

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.716
with the people around you
is just...

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:03.818
-It's just not acceptable.
-It's not acceptable.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.687
No. But otherwise,
I would say...

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:07.355
-Yeah.
-...Dan's vision

01:17:07.357 --> 01:17:08.923
has inspired everyone.

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:11.626
I mean, everyone has been
affected by this message.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.060
-Everyone has.
-Mm-hm.

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:14.128
Everyone has.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.963
I thought Dan Summers was crazy.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:19.800
When I first heard about this
whole movement I was stunned.

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.670
These new things
he was preaching,

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:27.174
you know, about... about
real life interaction... ah!

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:29.777
It-- it was jarring.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:34.281
But the truth is...

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:37.251
you know,
if you give it some time,

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:41.055
some practice,
it makes sense.

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:43.391
At some point,
I said to myself...

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:49.163
Steven, doc.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:54.702
You gotta just put yourself
out there.

01:17:58.741 --> 01:18:03.844
I've been on two actual
real life dates.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:05.846
Both insisted that I
not contact them again.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.682
But, you know...

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.985
My mom gave me this pup.

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:12.420
Bar mitzvah present.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.756
I was hoping for a bike.

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:18.793
I got a ceramic spaniel.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:22.730
She told me its name was Steve.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:26.067
I said, "Mom, that's my name."

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.403
She said, "It's a coincidence."

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:33.174
I have just started working
on my third book.

01:18:33.176 --> 01:18:37.845
Which is definitely largely
based on the...

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:40.347
goings on in the real world.

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:44.318
I... I like to stay relevant.

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:49.256
I try to stay young and...

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.094
And hip.

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:54.929
[groans]

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:01.769
In this book, um, uh...

01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:05.039
there are certain scenes of...

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.776
of a more physical nature.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:10.778
So to speak.

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:14.949
Sex.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:18.185
Physical sex, that is.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:22.757
Which... is... is definitely

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:25.993
out of my skill set.

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:28.896
Um...

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:32.032
But I happen to think
that you don't necessarily

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:34.769
have to have experienced
something to write about it.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.470
I don't...

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:39.940
I don't even think
you have to have experienced it

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.976
in your lifetime.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.447
That is why they
call it fiction.

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:51.385
Dan's work has actually been
a huge influence on my life.

01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:56.056
Um, after my breakdown...

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:59.293
during <i> The National</i>
<i> Influencer</i> shoot,

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.929
I had to give back all my pets

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:05.966
and stop vlogging
for a little bit.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.936
Obviously. Which is really hard.

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:14.408
But actually,
the pause helped me

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:18.379
figure out what I was really
passionate about.

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:21.148
And it's origami.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:25.352
Some people would say
that it's a lost art.

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:29.590
This is my cat.

01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:31.392
Hey, kitty. Here!

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:33.494
She's so cute.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:36.130
Um, and this is a bird.

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:39.066
Well, technically
it's a parakeet.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:41.435
But with just one shade
of construction paper,

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:44.238
it's hard to make that clear,
parakeet.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.940
It's a parakeet.

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:49.877
Um, and this is Dr. Spacelli.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:53.514
Uh, looks just like her.
[laughs]

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:57.885
Um, and I take her with me
everywhere.

01:20:57.887 --> 01:21:01.255
We're up to five days a week.
So that's really helping too.

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:02.389
[sighs]

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:08.362
It's just been such
rewarding work.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:12.333
It isn't easy, but...
we take it day by day.

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:15.236
The first step, the influencers.

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:19.540
The next step, the people.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:25.012
Because we aren't just
social beings.

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:28.282
We're human beings.

01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:33.921
That's the headline.

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:35.456
That's the headline right there.

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.226
Breaking news.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:42.663
-Who are we?
-[all] Humans.

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:45.466
-What are we not?
-[all] Handles.

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:48.135
-Who are we?
-[all] Humans.

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:50.337
-What are we not?
-[all] Handles.

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:53.040
-Who are we?
-[all] Humans.

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:55.209
-What are we not?
-[all] Handles.

01:21:55.211 --> 01:21:57.478
-Who are we?
-[all] Humans.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.080
-What are we not?
-[all] Handles.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:02.316
-Who are we?
-[all] Humans.

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:04.618
Apparently, the girl who
was supposed to be

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.121
the fifth influencer had some
sort of a breakdown.

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:08.656
-That's sad.
-Yeah, it was terrible.

01:22:08.658 --> 01:22:11.625
-So sad.
-But the good news was

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:14.695
-once she was out...
-We were in.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.697
-We were in the cover!
-Ah!

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:18.899
-Mm!
-Yeah!

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.100
Yeah! We danced around our
apartment for like 20 minutes.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.704
-I Snapchatted the whole thing.
-It was amazing.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:26.674
Ah! Oh, and...

01:22:26.676 --> 01:22:29.710
we love what Dan
has been saying.

01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:33.047
Oh, yeah. No, it's so important
what he's saying

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:39.053
about the people who...
need people...

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:42.156
Yeah, it's very much so. It's
completely changed our outlook.

01:22:42.158 --> 01:22:43.424
-Yeah.
-[man] Hey, guys?

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:45.960
-Yeah, how's it looking?
-Yeah, what's up?

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:47.594
[man] This angle,
from the side here,

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.463
is not great
for the Instagram Live.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:51.732
It'd be better
if you were more centered.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:54.735
Oh. Well, that's not good,
Kingston.

01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:56.393
-Sorry.
-Can you move?

01:22:56.394 --> 01:22:58.050
Yeah, sorry, could you move over
for him?

01:22:58.051 --> 01:22:59.707
He's shooting an Instagram Live
from my phone.

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:01.575
[man] Look, I'm trying
to shoot a documentary, guys.

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:04.211
[laughs] Okay,
but this is important.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.447
-So move.
-Yeah, did I stutter?

01:23:06.449 --> 01:23:08.682
You're gonna have to move over
for him. I'm sorry, buddy.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:11.051
-But you have to move over.
-[man] What are you doing?

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:15.389
[Kingston] Yeah, we... we still
on with that Instagram Live?

And I'm here...

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.583
as a guide, you know?

01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:59.253
I want her to tell me
when I have a flyaway hair.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:00.921
-You know?
-Speaking of which...

01:26:00.923 --> 01:26:03.223
-Speaking of which.
-Oh, actually,

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:04.791
that was very deliberate.
That was--

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:07.261
-I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-That's okay. No.

01:26:07.263 --> 01:26:09.496
But that was a deliberate look.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.298

you're going to...
