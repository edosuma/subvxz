19:07.560 --> 19:09.376
Charlie, look. I don't
know what's been going on.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.210
But if you think you can make
it stop, I need your help.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.124
<i>[ Sighs ]
I want you back in my life.</i>

19:15.200 --> 19:19.000
- Do you really mean that?
- Yeah.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.525
I need you.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.763
Okay.
<i>I'll</i> be right there.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.803
Awesome. Well, I'm out of here.
VVh at?

19:25.880 --> 19:28.326
What are you talking about?
I'm leaving.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.456
I'm going to be with the waitress.
She's the woman I love.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.086
No, but I-I wasn't using
you like Trevor was.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.403
He's a total asshole. I really,
really, really like you.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.529
Oh.
Yeah, I know.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.001
Okay?
I was using you.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.321
That's why I kissed you
in front of the waitress.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.404
That's why I banged you a bunch of times,
just to make the waitress jealous.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.801
Amazing. You slept with
me almost instantly.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.848
And by the way, a quality
woman doesn't do that.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.851
She doesn't say yes right away. She says
no to a man, for years, like, 1 O years.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.365
That's what a real woman does.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.091
You know what you were acting like?
A stupid little rich slut.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.083
And that's all that you are.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.527
[ Sobbing ] How can
you do this to me?

20:04.640 --> 20:06.529
Are you still talking?
Go away, dum-dum.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.085
Go. Run and hide.
Go from me.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.521
[ Sobbing ] I d0n't want
to see you anymore.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.524
[ Chuckles ]
Women, right?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.602
Ah, man. All right, cool.
I'm out!

20:15.680 --> 20:17.250
Oh!

20:17.400 --> 20:19.721
[Whistles ]
I didn't see that coming.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.962
No.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.611
Guess Charlie had the cruelest
intentions of all, huh?

20:26.160 --> 20:29.084
Uh, see?
Feeling better?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.730
Yeah.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.929
You know, I-I've, um-I've been
thinking about the restraining order.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.327
You're gonna get rid of it?
No. No, no.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.244
But, um-But I was thinking
about reducing it...

20:39.320 --> 20:42.642
from, like, a hundred
feet to, like, 5O feet?

20:42.760 --> 20:44.569
[ Sighs ]
Awesome!

20:44.720 --> 20:45.720
Okay-
Okay-

20:45.800 --> 20:47.643
I can work with that. All right.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.121
Oh, so now?
Starting now?

20:50.200 --> 20:53.124
Yeah, probably. Could you
just leave the soup there?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.601
Uh, is this okay
over here, or-

20:55.680 --> 20:58.923
Uh, I don't think there's
50 feet in this room, so-

20:59.040 --> 21:02.044
Um, I'll go down the hall.
Okay. Yeah.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.271
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:03.283 --> 21:06.045
All right. Well, that's fine.
From a distance though.
