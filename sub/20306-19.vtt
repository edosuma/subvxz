WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:05.255
-(chattering)
-STAN: Okay, item five; moving day.

00:05.338 --> 00:08.633
Now, unless there's some
last-minute legal maneuvers,

00:08.717 --> 00:11.761
the first of four Black families,
first ones ever,

00:11.845 --> 00:16.016
are moving into the O'Neill
housing project at 9:00 this a.m.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.727
The tenants' groups
have been fighting this tooth and nail

00:18.810 --> 00:20.562
ever since the city took ownership.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.107
And, uh, they are not good losers.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.819
We got Lieutenant Hunter
and the emergency-action units

00:27.902 --> 00:30.822
coordinating with the housing units
at the scene.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.033
Now be alert for possible backups.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.617
Item six.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.495
This is a memo from Division

00:37.579 --> 00:41.666
announcing the Ray Augustine scholarship
at Memorial High School.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.752
Any of you could spare a few extra bucks.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.421
Uh, Officer Augustine
was out of the Heights.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.759
Just a reminder,
his funeral's at, uh, 4:00 this afternoon

00:50.842 --> 00:54.179
at All Saints' Cemetery
over on Union Avenue.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.180
Item seven.

00:55.930 --> 01:00.018
This is the anniversary of legal abortion
in this state.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.311
WOMAN: All right!

01:01.394 --> 01:03.480
The right-to-lifers are demonstrating

01:03.563 --> 01:06.316
in front of the Jefferson
Family-Planning Clinic,

01:06.399 --> 01:08.985
which brought the case
that the court decided on.

01:09.069 --> 01:15.325
Uh, Sergeant Bates, Officers Coffey,
Hill and Renko, you're assigned.

01:15.408 --> 01:19.496
Other assignments,
um, Detectives LaRue and Washington,

01:19.579 --> 01:20.789
you're on court call.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.582
-Again?
-Ah, come on, Sarge.

01:22.665 --> 01:26.252
-Downtown at the Mendoza trial.
-Yo, J.D., pitch a tent.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.879
-(laughter)
-STAN: Yeah, let...

01:27.962 --> 01:29.839
Let me finish, let me finish.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.176
Simpson rides with Jamison,
Donahue with Frame.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.804
-Okay, that's it.
-COFFEY: Hey, no, it's not.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.181
No, it's not. Final item.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.141
The time, last night.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.935
The place, Bowlmor Lanes.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.353
Spring League showdown,

01:43.436 --> 01:46.606
the Hill versus crosstown nemesis
South Ferry.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.566
-(laughter)
-It is crunch time.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.111
And the man with the plan,

01:51.736 --> 01:55.198
Sergeant Stan Jablonski,
bowling a 300 game!

01:55.281 --> 01:58.785
(cheering, applauding)

02:01.079 --> 02:04.415
I'm telling you, this man right here
was unconscious!

02:04.749 --> 02:07.377
-(laughs) That?
-MAN: Come on, Sir.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.837
Come on, Sarge, your reaction?

02:09.504 --> 02:13.133
What can I say? It's once in a lifetime.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.344
I mean, I was bowling solid all night,

02:16.427 --> 02:19.430
but all of a sudden,
this game is in the seventh frame,

02:19.681 --> 02:21.474
nothing but pocket hits.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.310
Nothing but strikes on the score sheet.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.979
It's like I got the plague.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.814
All of a sudden,
everybody's leaving me alone

02:27.897 --> 02:28.940
over at the end of the bench.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.441
Yeah, we didn't want to jinx you.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.571
Second ball in the tenth
is a Brooklyn hit...

02:34.863 --> 02:37.198
five pin's shaking like a hula girl.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.242
Then she drops.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.412
(cheering, applauding)

02:42.495 --> 02:44.539
That's when I finally let myself hope.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.168
"Stush," I'm thinking,
"This could be your night."

02:48.751 --> 02:50.712
Last ball, I'm like this.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.882
My ticker is doing the dead-beat tattoo.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.633
-(laughter)
-MAN: Then what happened?

02:55.717 --> 02:58.136
I roll... I close my eyes...

02:59.596 --> 03:02.599
Next thing I know,
this joker's carrying me off the lane

03:02.682 --> 03:04.475
like I'm the queen of the bank!

03:04.559 --> 03:07.270
(cheering, applauding)

03:07.353 --> 03:09.147
(whistling)

03:09.230 --> 03:11.065
Whoo!

03:11.774 --> 03:13.193
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.404
Okay, okay,
that's it with the sports report.

03:16.487 --> 03:17.405
(laughter)

03:17.488 --> 03:21.284
Let's roll. Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.996
RENKO: Why would they even want to move
into the O'Neill Projects?

03:25.079 --> 03:26.873
All I know is they got a right
to be there, Renko.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.750
(chattering)

03:29.042 --> 03:30.251
COFFEY: Good going, Sarge.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.505
Housing projects are like
great ocean reefs, Valentine.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.757
Thank you, Leo.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.967
The form itself is inanimate,

03:38.051 --> 03:41.804
but within is a Darwinian carnival
of the sociologically deprived.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.890
I don't know that it would be much
of a party today, sir.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.475
Well, pack your helmets, Valentine.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.186
Okay, look, you got the number.
We'll wait for your call.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.103
(telephone thuds)

03:49.187 --> 03:50.021
NEAL: All set?

03:50.104 --> 03:52.523
J.D.: Bernstein says he needs us in court,
which I doubt.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.651
Hey, it's one call.
We're there in 20 minutes.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.195
MAN: J.D., I thought I could run over
some of these script changes with you

03:57.278 --> 03:59.781
-on the way to the studio.
-What do you mean, changes?

03:59.864 --> 04:03.034
Listen, what you wrote is terrific.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.328
But I took the liberty of adding
a couple of women here.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.705
You know, a little feminine interest.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.915
Why would that be?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.960
A, we actually see the victim.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.836
Get some sympathy going.

04:13.920 --> 04:19.217
Your market for the home-security video
is your crime-terrorized housewives.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.345
B, you get audience identification.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.889
This way they see themselves at risk.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.893
This guy is a stone genius, Neal.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.646
-Young DeMille, huh?
-(taps)

04:31.729 --> 04:32.730
Hoo!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.482
Hey, look, J.D., I'll be in it, man,

04:34.565 --> 04:36.317
but there ain't no way
I'm kicking in a thousand bucks.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.445
Hey, Neal, pass up money
laying in the street. Go ahead.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.573
Whoo! Hey, hey, hey, Lieutenant!

04:42.657 --> 04:45.285
-Now, those are some serious vines.
-Thank you.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.453
Good morning.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.374
-Whoa! He looks terrific.
-Jerk.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.167
Gigolo.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.587
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:56.671 --> 04:58.423
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:58.506 --> 05:02.343
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:02.427 --> 05:03.970
(sirens wailing)

05:09.434 --> 05:12.061
(theme music playing)

06:35.269 --> 06:38.231
Stan, did you get Howard's unit
dispatched to the O'Neill Projects?

06:38.314 --> 06:39.732
On the way. Problem already?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.275
First family's moving in.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.486
There's no violence yet,
but that crowd seemed unstable.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.115
We could beef up our complement there,
pull somebody off the, uh, abortion mill.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.158
-Jefferson Clinic?
-Right.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.411
I think you'd want to keep
our profile high there, too.

06:51.494 --> 06:55.081
Then just double pass-by at O'Neill.
Howard will keep us posted.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.084
New threads, Henry?

06:58.584 --> 06:59.669
It's a gift.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.795
Nice.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.255
It's a look.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.844
-Excuse me, Sergeant Jablonski?
-You got him.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.431
Artie Neems, BAA regional secretary.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.351
-You rolled the<i> perfecto </i>at Bowlmor Lanes?
-(chuckles)

07:15.435 --> 07:17.687
-Alley nine, last night.
-That was me.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.149
Okay, your 300 was submitted
for sanction this morning.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.359
-Yeah?
-I'm just coming from the lanes now.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.403
Um, the pins from alley nine?

07:25.486 --> 07:26.988
-Checked out perfectly.
-Good.

07:27.071 --> 07:30.408
But we've run into a small problem
with the lane dressing.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.243
What are you talking about?

07:32.326 --> 07:34.579
-I ran the tests, Mr. Jablonski.
-Yeah.

07:35.037 --> 07:38.082
The alley was oiled
too thickly down the middle.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.292
How do you say?

07:39.375 --> 07:43.129
And, of course,
excessive oil can groove the lane.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.130
Um...

07:44.672 --> 07:49.177
The bottom line, sir,
is we can't allow your 300 game.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.390
What's the real bottom line?

07:56.017 --> 07:58.394
You want 100 bucks
to get it sanctioned, huh?

07:58.686 --> 08:01.522
The real bottom line
is what I just told you, sir.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.484
I hope next time
we can get you in the record books.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.401
Next time?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.029
I've been bowling for 40 years.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.989
You tell me when's next time?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.199
Could be tomorrow.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.242
Could be I'm not gonna
take this lying down.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.954
Could be I'm gonna appeal this decision!

08:17.622 --> 08:19.332
Hey, that's your right, of course.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.125
Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.836
Yeah, you look all broke up.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.634
J.D.: It's a quarter after 10:00.
Jane Smith's husband's out of town.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.929
Jane's... Jane's checking the house

08:33.221 --> 08:36.682
before she looks in on the kids
and goes to bed.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.686
Now it's 2:15,

08:41.729 --> 08:43.064
four hours later.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.442
And for all the trouble
that this burglar's gonna have

08:46.526 --> 08:47.860
coming through those locks,

08:47.944 --> 08:51.781
Jane might just as well have
left the windows wide open.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.909
Yes, the Smith family
is about to get robbed.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.369
Oh, damn!

08:56.452 --> 08:57.954
Hold it, hold it. What's the matter, babe?

08:58.037 --> 09:01.582
Oh, man, you got a nail coming
out of the ledge here.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.001
Can I get this filed down?
Can I get a little help here?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.921
-Larry, how am I doing?
-Great. You're great.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.674
-(knocks on window)
-I'll be with you in just a second.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.637
Oh, hey, Larry,
we're doing the group scene. We need Lulu.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.014
Lulu, honey, they need you next door,
two minutes.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.684
-I must be working with Tony.
-(scoffs)

09:20.643 --> 09:22.478
Joey, you can't fix it,
lay a cloth over it.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.063
Just make sure it doesn't read.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.856
What are they shooting next door?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.859
It's another project.
This place is a beehive.

09:29.277 --> 09:33.281
Listen (clears throat) John,
can I get that grand-ski from you now?

09:33.364 --> 09:36.367
-The crew needs half before we roll here.
-Sure.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.036
Uh, don't forget
to get a receipt-ski, babe.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.122
It's a good thing I'm not sensitive, Neal.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.374
Uh, nothing personal, Mr. Stein.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.459
It's just that I've seen J.D.
go down the tubes

09:45.543 --> 09:47.086
on a couple of other projects, you know.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.381
Yeah, on this project,
the man gets 20 cents on every buck

09:50.464 --> 09:53.092
till his investment's out
and a dime on every buck after.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.386
Plus, he's got full access to my books.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.472
Now, come on, Neal, be serious.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.225
You think I'm looking to take somebody,
I'm gonna hit on a cop?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.478
Okay, let's make magic, folks!

10:05.146 --> 10:06.647
MAN: Open up the barn door...

10:07.690 --> 10:10.568
Like the man says,
nobody's right when everybody's wrong.

10:10.651 --> 10:11.736
Religion and politics, Renko.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.821
I'm talking about the people
hootin' and hollering--

10:13.904 --> 10:16.782
BOBBY: Some people, it means...

10:16.866 --> 10:20.077
MAN: Are you going to have an abortion?
Are you going to have an abortion?

10:20.161 --> 10:22.079
-WOMAN: It's none of your business.
-RENKO: This way, ma'am.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.956
Would you read our literature?

10:24.040 --> 10:27.168
-Out of the way!
-Have you examined all the alternatives?

10:27.251 --> 10:30.254
Do you believe these demonstrations
are part of an organized campaign, Doctor?

10:30.338 --> 10:31.631
-Damn right.
-Get off, sir.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.466
Happy with your extra 50 feet?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.509
Now you can get a little closer
to make people miserable.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.136
What is your business in the clinic, sir?

10:37.219 --> 10:38.638
I'm a doctor. Is that business enough?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.181
MAN: You think you're helping these women?

10:40.264 --> 10:41.974
Someday, they're gonna hate you
for what you're doing.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.684
Do you do this because your life is empty.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.311
You're some sort of emotional cripple.

10:45.394 --> 10:49.398
I do this because I believe
in the sanctity of life, all life,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.567
which is more than I can say for you, sir!

10:52.026 --> 10:53.110
This is what you do!

10:53.194 --> 10:54.779
That's what you do!

10:54.862 --> 10:57.865
-You sick--
-(clamoring)

10:58.699 --> 10:59.700
(screams)

10:59.784 --> 11:04.497
-That's right!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.999
-Oh, my God!
-MAN: Sorry! Sorry!

11:07.083 --> 11:09.543
-I have to go home. (groans)
-Easy, easy.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.004
-What is it?
-Ah! Ah! Is someone a doctor?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.091
-MAN: I'm a doctor. Let me through.
-Something's wrong.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.467
-Are you pregnant?
-Yes.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.345
-You having contractions?
-(groans)

11:19.428 --> 11:20.763
Maybe we should take her inside.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.640
-We don't have the facilities.
-Hospital's up the street.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.766
(groans)

11:23.849 --> 11:26.268
BOBBY: All right, excuse us.
Everybody out of the way!

11:26.352 --> 11:29.355
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

11:29.438 --> 11:31.273
-(clamoring)
-I'm sorry.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.985
You are going away, fella.
I'm gonna see that you go away.

11:35.069 --> 11:35.986
MAN: Sorry.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.614
(crowd chanting)
Right to life! Right to life!

11:38.698 --> 11:43.202
Right to life! Right to life!
Right to life!

11:43.285 --> 11:45.746
(police siren wails)

11:48.374 --> 11:51.001
I'm not having more contractions.
I need to go home.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.128
Doctor says not.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.046
You can talk to him
when we get to the hospital.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.591
My husband's gonna find out.
I didn't tell him.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.970
Please, he can't know.
He can't see this now.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.556
-You're already having contractions.
-(groans)

12:04.140 --> 12:07.893
-I don't see any other choice right now.
-Domenic is gonna be home!

12:08.686 --> 12:10.563
Look, you won't believe me right now,

12:10.646 --> 12:12.606
but people are sometimes
more understanding

12:12.690 --> 12:14.066
than you think they're gonna be.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.192
I see it all the time.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.862
Yeah, but I wasn't gonna
have the procedure.

12:17.945 --> 12:21.615
I mean, they couldn't do it at the clinic
because they said I was too far along.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.909
So they were referring me here
to the hospital.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.287
-To Mercy?
-Yeah, but I wasn't going to.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.623
I swear to God!
I only went for information.

12:29.707 --> 12:34.628
And then by the time that I walked out,
I already decided, no, no, I wasn't.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.340
And then right after that...
when the man threw the blood.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.634
I mean, is that right?

12:40.718 --> 12:44.013
God punishes you
just for wanting information?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.264
No.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.349
-No, that isn't-- I don't think--
-(panting)

12:47.433 --> 12:50.728
Take it easy. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

12:50.811 --> 12:54.064
-Let's go, Joe. Let's go.
-(car engine revving)

12:54.148 --> 12:57.943
My wife's doc is head of OB at Mercy.
He says that woman's gonna deliver.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.236
She's in her 20th week.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.489
Chances are about one in a billion
the kid will live.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.990
Then we should charge murder.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.160
Facts sound more like
involuntary manslaughter, Joyce.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.328
I disagree.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.331
The assault on the doctor
was a violent felony.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.626
Assailant's responsible
for the foreseeable results.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.419
If the child dies, it's murder.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.755
Look, I'm not competent in the legalities.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.798
Correct.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.050
But I can tell you that a murder charge

13:21.133 --> 13:24.762
will put pro- and anti-abortion groups
outside of every clinic in my precinct.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.389
-And I won't have a single cop available--
-That's a manpower problem.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.225
It shouldn't determine
whether and how we prosecute.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.977
How about let's hope
for "stays a nice, simple assault case."

13:32.061 --> 13:34.772
Four months from now,
the woman delivers a healthy baby boy.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.525
Gender bigot.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.652
-You okay for staying on this?
-Yes.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.075
-(door closes)
-Are you sure?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.078
Meaning what, Frank?

13:49.161 --> 13:51.956
That I have personal feelings
when a fanatic assaults a pregnant woman?

13:52.039 --> 13:54.750
I do. Why does that disqualify me
from prosecution?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.836
-It doesn't.
-But what.

13:56.919 --> 13:57.753
Well, listen to yourself.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.421
There hasn't even been
a police report yet,

13:59.505 --> 14:00.631
and you're ready to charge murder.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.091
Never mind that the woman
hasn't delivered.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.219
If the woman doesn't deliver,
obviously there won't be a murder charge.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.096
If the baby doesn't die, obviously...

14:09.139 --> 14:12.101
I would like to see the police reports
as quickly as possible.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.566
I'm Chapman, Mr. Ardrey,
you've requested a public defender?

14:18.649 --> 14:19.483
Yes.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.319
Which means I babysit
till the first team gets here?

14:22.820 --> 14:23.988
I don't understand.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.531
Please turn to the right.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.658
Don't you people have anyone on retainer?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.452
Aren't there any lawyers
with a hotline to the most high?

14:31.203 --> 14:34.331
Look, I'm not a member of a group.
I don't have money for a lawyer.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.333
Do I gather you'd rather not represent me?

14:37.626 --> 14:38.836
I'll represent you.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.672
Is there an interrogation room available?

14:41.755 --> 14:42.715
Yeah, B.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.051
-Have you heard how that woman is?
-No.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.931
As many times as I have asked
for more police--

14:51.015 --> 14:53.642
Miss Lane, there were four uniforms
outside your clinic.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.727
And it wasn't enough.

14:54.810 --> 14:55.936
We've had this discussion.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.898
Whatever our presence,
confrontations are going to occur.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.319
What are your views on abortion, Captain?

15:04.820 --> 15:07.114
I believe you had appropriate protection.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.159
You may be defending that position
in court.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.619
Please excuse me.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.834
I can't believe it.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.838
I came downstairs this morning
and saw the house had been robbed.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.466
Oh, you poor thing!

15:25.841 --> 15:29.470
If only we had consulted
a qualified security expert.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.473
It's too late for the Smith family now.

15:32.556 --> 15:35.434
But it's not too late for us
to learn from their mistakes,

15:35.517 --> 15:39.563
for you to make your home safer,
your family crime-free.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.859
First, let's go through
our six-point security checklist.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.321
See these locks on the windows?

15:50.532 --> 15:53.160
They're better than nothing,
but to a skilled burglar,

15:53.243 --> 15:55.704
these are an invitation to grand theft.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.456
What about the doors?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.416
Even when locked,

15:59.792 --> 16:03.462
the average entry simply asks
the criminal-minded for trouble.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.591
It might as well spell "rob me"
in big, red letters.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.055
-Ugh!
-Cut! Cut, cut, cut.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.140
-(buzzes)
-Man, I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry!

16:15.224 --> 16:16.809
It's okay, John. Let's try it again, huh.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.560
Hey, looking good, babe. Looking good.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.562
-Where from?
-(knocks on door)

16:21.230 --> 16:23.148
Tick-tock, Larry. We need the room.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.651
Hey, we got it till 1:00.
Give me a break here, huh.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.445
John, we're gonna take it
from where you cross to the door again.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.698
Only this time, let's see
if you can make it look

16:30.781 --> 16:31.991
like you're actually walking.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.325
'cause I got to be honest with you,

16:33.409 --> 16:35.244
it looks a little
like you got a board in your back.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.830
-(giggles)
-Girls, you were fine.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.707
Maybe I should take it from the top,
huh, Larry?

16:39.790 --> 16:42.126
No, no, no, we'll go
with what we have up to the cross.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.836
I think I can do it better.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.714
So could a corpse, J.D.,
but we haven't got the time.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.757
(woman moaning)

16:48.841 --> 16:50.759
Sorry, it was a cheap shot.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.511
(moaning continues)

16:52.594 --> 16:54.972
What the hell is going on over there?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.766
Acting. Come on, places.
You can do it, J.D.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.769
-You're doing great.
-(moaning continues)

17:00.853 --> 17:02.688
(horns honking)

17:07.735 --> 17:11.572
Man, that abortion clinic fracas
is gonna be a real set-to, Robert,

17:11.655 --> 17:14.783
with the doctors and lawyers quoting
scripture at each other from both sides.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.787
-Scriptures with a little "s."
-Yes, sir, with a little "s."

17:18.871 --> 17:20.998
Now, here's the kind of question
I can relate to,

17:21.081 --> 17:24.001
a split-level, two-bedroom,
living room and dinette.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.669
Is this dwelling within the winsome

17:25.753 --> 17:28.338
Daryl Ann and Andrew's
financial ways and means?

17:28.714 --> 17:29.590
Yes.

17:29.673 --> 17:30.966
"It's an hour-and-a-quarter commute,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.927
but you will not discover
a two-bedroom home for $63,000

17:34.011 --> 17:35.054
any closer to the city."

17:35.137 --> 17:36.972
Renko, I never heard you talk
so much about money.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.850
-There ain't nothing wrong with money.
-Nothing that having some wouldn't cure.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.685
This is where my daughter's gonna grow up.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.897
She's gonna ride her bicycle
down to the school yard. Right here.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.232
WOMAN (on radio):<i> All units,</i>
<i>disturbance at the O'Neill Projects--</i>

17:47.316 --> 17:49.610
<i>125th and Jerome. Gang related.</i>

17:49.693 --> 17:50.819
-2202 in response.
-(police siren wailing)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.196
Well, it took a while.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.615
That Black family's
been there almost one hour.

17:54.698 --> 17:57.826
-If you ask me, they're buying trouble.
-(police siren wailing continues)

17:57.910 --> 18:01.747
(clamoring)

18:01.830 --> 18:04.541
(police siren wails)

18:09.463 --> 18:12.216
All right, up against the wall!
Every one of you! Drop your weapon!

18:12.299 --> 18:14.635
-(gun cocks)
-Get up against the wall! Turn around!

18:15.886 --> 18:17.179
-Turn around!
-(grunts)

18:17.262 --> 18:20.599
All right. You're all under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.435
-He came after me!
-We didn't do nothing!

18:23.519 --> 18:25.813
Come here. I want you to shut up.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.898
If you give up the right to remain silent,

18:27.981 --> 18:30.484
what you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.568
-You understand that?
-Yeah, I understand.

18:31.652 --> 18:32.778
-You understand?
-Yeah!

18:32.861 --> 18:34.404
STAN: Mr. Hammond, I have--

18:35.197 --> 18:38.408
I have here in my hand
the<i> 1983 Guide To Bowling,</i>

18:38.492 --> 18:42.955
published by your organization,
of which I have read every chapter.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.790
Now, it tells me about foul lines.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.250
It tells me about etiquette.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.752
Tells me about 28 different regulations,

18:48.836 --> 18:54.049
but it does not tell me word one
about quantity of oil,

18:54.299 --> 18:56.802
types of oil... nothing.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.224
For three bucks, you'd be happy to send me
the official rule book.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.477
This is the kind of rules
you got in there? Oil?

19:06.728 --> 19:10.149
What if I bowl 300 on a Wednesday?
Does that count?

19:10.649 --> 19:15.112
What if I bowl 300 with a red shirt on?
Does it count then, huh?

19:15.487 --> 19:18.740
-Nah. No, don't bother.
-(slams receiver)

19:19.575 --> 19:22.286
-Officer Schnitz.
-Mrs. Srignoli.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.123
Would you be kind enough to let
Lieutenant Goldblume know I'm here?

19:26.206 --> 19:27.374
Certainly.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.751
Hunter's got his guys around
the perimeter,

19:29.835 --> 19:32.337
-and county housing has jurisdiction.
-(knocks on door)

19:33.589 --> 19:35.507
-Excuse me, Lieutenant?
-Yeah?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.259
Mrs. Srignoli's here.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.596
We okay at O'Neill, Frank?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.265
<i>Bon appétit, </i>Henry.

19:45.100 --> 19:45.976
Thank you.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.692
HARRY: I don't know.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.737
Maybe she's got a thing
for men in midlife crisis.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.822
Or maybe he's helping her
with her memoirs.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.200
"I was a gangland tramp."

20:01.283 --> 20:02.284
What did you say, Fay?

20:02.951 --> 20:03.827
Nothing.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.663
I happen to be in love with Gina, Fay.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.208
Love? Is that what they're
calling it these days, Henry?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.335
-That's beneath you.
-(sighs)

20:11.418 --> 20:14.129
Maybe, but we all know what's beneath you.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.758
Excuse me. Miss Davenport.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.928
Legal conundrum discussion group?

20:21.011 --> 20:22.846
-Finish intake with Ardrey?
-Mm-hmm.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.098
It's pretty interesting, as fanatics go.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.268
I got to say, I gave him a few
things to think about.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.563
I've kept the assault charge
instated for this afternoon's arraignment.

20:32.105 --> 20:32.981
We may amend.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.316
If the baby dies.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.153
Want something to look forward to?

20:39.154 --> 20:40.030
What?

20:40.530 --> 20:46.078
Think about my client, the zealot,
when I argue the fetus wasn't viable.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.456
It hasn't died yet.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.041
No, but I'm saying, I mean...

20:51.500 --> 20:54.294
I think I can lick you on intent,
maybe proximate cause,

20:54.378 --> 20:56.672
but I've got to make the other
argument, too, right?

20:57.047 --> 21:00.884
Baby hasn't breathed
without a machine since it was born.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.344
Isn't that great?

21:02.427 --> 21:06.056
Here's this guy, thinks life begins
with the first randy thought.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.518
His defense is gonna be
the fetus wasn't life.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.481
Excuse me.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.910
Plus, it has all the modern
conveniences...

21:27.411 --> 21:30.914
wall-to-wall carpeting, high ceilings,

21:30.998 --> 21:34.418
24-hour spa, masseuse on call.

21:35.168 --> 21:36.503
Do you like it, Henry?

21:38.005 --> 21:39.548
I'm crazy about it.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.967
Oh, good.

21:42.884 --> 21:48.098
Of course, I haven't had time to do
a whole lot in the way of decorating yet.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.725
That's perfectly understandable.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.437
Just a few of the bare... necessities.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.276
(laughs)

21:59.901 --> 22:01.611
-I need a gurney in here.
-(woman groaning)

22:01.695 --> 22:02.779
Can you tell us what's going on?

22:02.863 --> 22:04.448
-Is there contractions again?
-Yes.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.700
Can you tell me about Ann Florio?
I'm her husband.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.327
-Yeah.
-What are they saying about contractions?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.454
You got to talk to her doctor, Mr. Florio.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.372
Who's her doctor?
We've never been to this hospital before.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.333
-Why don't you just relax--
-Annie!

22:14.750 --> 22:17.294
-Are the kids all right?
-Yeah, honey, everybody's all right.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.463
-What happened?
-(Ann screams)

22:19.546 --> 22:20.756
(door closes)

22:20.839 --> 22:23.550
-You guys tell me what happened?
-Yeah, she fell.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.970
Mr. Florio, uh, they're gonna explain
the whole thing to you, so...

22:27.054 --> 22:29.139
Did you hear that?
How could she have her baby?

22:31.266 --> 22:32.559
She's only five months along.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.535
Stan, what could I say?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.580
A terrible set of circumstances here.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.457
How could a thing like this happen?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.209
Didn't you know the rules?

22:57.292 --> 23:00.754
Hey, Stan, my lane buffer is 11 years old.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.090
I'm lucky it works two out of three days.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.426
The fact is, Stan,
the lanes are a little grooved.

23:06.510 --> 23:10.180
Scores get a boost,
people go out of here feeling terrific.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.475
-So, what's so terrible about that?
-You're kidding me.

23:13.975 --> 23:16.103
They pulled that crap in the stone age,

23:16.186 --> 23:18.563
scotch tape on the alleys,
nails on the boards.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.899
-Come on, Stan.
-No, no, you come on.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.068
Never mind the Bowling Federation.

23:23.151 --> 23:25.112
I don't know now whether
what I did was real.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.614
Hey, you still get your free games,

23:27.697 --> 23:29.950
and your picture's still
on the "Wall of Fame" there.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.618
And that's forever, Stan.

23:31.701 --> 23:32.786
(chuckles)

23:32.869 --> 23:34.162
-Hi, Tom.
-Hi.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.791
-Shoes? Lane six.
-Yeah, 11 and a half.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.918
-Lane six.
-YOUNG MAN: Thanks.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.044
Have a good game.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.462
Look at that.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.548
You just rented that kid a pair of shoes.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.050
Did you spray them first? No, you did not.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.928
I'll bet everybody walks out
of here with athlete's foot.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.722
-Stan, I know how you feel.
-I'll tell you how I feel.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.100
I feel like getting my league
to move right out of here.

23:55.725 --> 23:59.771
You're speaking upon emotions,
and you're going off half-cocked, Stan.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.774
Yeah? Half-cocked? Here's half-cocked.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.405
Here is your cockamamie "Wall of Fame."

24:09.573 --> 24:11.867
Somebody ought to shut you down for good.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.994
-Stan, may I say something?
-What?

24:14.703 --> 24:16.496
I think you're being a sore loser.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.707
I'll show you sore loser.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.750
-Stan!
-Ah!

24:22.711 --> 24:24.921
-She delivered.
-I heard.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.756
He said it weighs a pound.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.261
Leo, disorderly conduct
in the vicinity of the O'Neill Projects.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.345
Name?

24:34.014 --> 24:35.182
Dean Johnson.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.933
Look, where's my lawyer?

24:37.017 --> 24:40.937
-Address?
-2545 Edgewater Avenue.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.357
Mr. Johnson's got an attitude
problem here, Leo.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.985
-Captain?
-Pull them into interrogation.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.446
You heard the man. Move it, boys.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.574
What's the scam, Furillo?

24:52.657 --> 24:55.452
I just want a couple minutes of your time,
then I think we'll let you go.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.580
-So, we can walk.
-That's the idea.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.208
Provided you walk away
from the situation at the housing project.

25:01.291 --> 25:04.085
-Blacks got no business--
-We got people there need protection.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.755
People should live where
they're supposed to live!

25:07.672 --> 25:08.757
Sit down!

25:12.135 --> 25:12.969
It's a mess.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.430
Whatever it is, it's gonna be without you.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.350
I want word out,
and you're gonna be my messengers.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.436
Those projects are DMZ, off-limits.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.606
My cops see gang colors, it's an automatic
bust. Is that understood?

25:24.689 --> 25:26.691
(chuckles)

25:27.776 --> 25:28.777
So, can we go?

25:30.237 --> 25:32.447
-You can go.
-Get up.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.242
RENKO: Get up, get outta here. Get up.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.794
FRANK: I want you on overtime
in those projects tonight.

25:45.877 --> 25:46.753
-All right.
-Andy?

25:46.836 --> 25:48.672
Captain, I heard the woman had her baby.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.007
-He gonna make it?
-Very critical. It's on life support.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.303
-How'd it go?
-Give me my clipboard.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.223
-Any luck?
-Guy doesn't deserve my grief. He's a bum.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.475
You could complain
to the Better Business Bureau.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.019
I should have taken an ax
and chopped up his lousy lane nine.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.772
That I should've done. Aw, I'm sick.
I don't even want to talk about it.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.899
J.D., you got a second?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.485
My man Larry! Hey...

26:11.403 --> 26:12.654
Is that what I think it is?

26:12.737 --> 26:15.574
Yes and no. Yes, this is our product.

26:15.657 --> 26:19.286
But no, my feeling is
after viewing the first assemblage--

26:19.369 --> 26:23.081
this is not going to be the high-impact
commercial property we were hoping for.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.374
-No?
-No.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.876
And I'm talking by a considerable margin.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.837
This is not<i> Birth of a Nation.</i>

26:29.379 --> 26:31.006
-I'm disappointed.
-(clicks tongue)

26:31.089 --> 26:32.674
That's the nature of the beast, fellas.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.802
That's why any producer worth
his salt in this business

26:35.885 --> 26:38.054
always has his contingencies.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.474
Now, I believe that our investment
in this piece of work

26:41.558 --> 26:43.602
is absolutely salvageable.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.855
-How so?
-Okay, we go back in,

26:46.938 --> 26:50.066
we shoot some additional scenes
around the original material,

26:50.150 --> 26:53.361
reshape the concept
for a totally different audience.

26:53.820 --> 26:54.738
Which one?

26:57.115 --> 26:58.158
Grown-ups.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.368
People who, they see people in love,

27:00.452 --> 27:02.829
don't mind seeing them
express it with each other.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.540
-You mean--
-Look.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.334
I don't know what
your personal feelings are,

27:07.417 --> 27:10.211
but this is strictly First Amendment,
chapter and verse.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.588
It's perfectly legal.

27:12.130 --> 27:15.508
-You want me to be in the sex scenes?
-Only if you're agreeable.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.552
Only for purposes of continuity.

27:18.386 --> 27:19.596
J.D., are you crazy?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.891
You're not talking
to a prude here, Larry, okay?

27:22.974 --> 27:25.935
But someone from Division
gets a whiff of this, my career is over.

27:26.394 --> 27:29.147
Listen, these films are absolutely legal.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.609
Plus, what would a guy from Division
say he was doing in the theater?

27:33.693 --> 27:34.611
That's a point.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.697
Here comes the train...
Here comes the collision.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.449
Wait a minute, Neal. Wait a minute.

27:41.868 --> 27:42.869
You, uh...

27:43.328 --> 27:45.747
You're telling me that Lulu
would go along with this?

27:45.830 --> 27:48.458
Hey, the woman's a professional.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.877
Look, we got all the elements,

27:50.960 --> 27:54.005
her husband's out of town,
burglar gets in,

27:54.422 --> 27:56.341
security guard comes by...

27:57.133 --> 27:58.677
A girlfriend drops in.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.137
Nature takes its course.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.640
I'm out, babe. Don't do it.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.434
Could I, uh...

28:07.143 --> 28:08.895
Could I see what we got
to this point, Larry?

28:08.978 --> 28:10.021
Take it, look.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.315
So I could make a more informed decision.

28:12.399 --> 28:16.277
Please, we're partners. I want your input.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.197
Right.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.619
WOMAN (on PA):<i> Nurse Harris to triage.</i>

28:24.911 --> 28:26.788
<i>Nurse Harris to triage.</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:30.083
Your wife's sleeping.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.504
You believe a woman
does something like that?

28:37.006 --> 28:40.009
This here, this is me being out of work,

28:40.093 --> 28:41.428
me not being able to put
the bread on the table.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.264
-Hey, come on.
-No way she does it otherwise.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.851
No way something like this happens.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.228
Why don't you just take
it easy, Mr. Florio?

28:50.770 --> 28:52.397
I'm saying that's why it happened.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.566
I couldn't meet my responsibilities.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.903
There's no way the kid's gonna make it.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.196
Believe me there's no way.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.908
He's too little.
He don't have the maturity.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.787
I heard the doc say you never know.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.205
Yeah, that's them talking.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.958
Let them talk,
then you look into their eyes.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.543
See? Look at that.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.130
My baby's this big.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.883
The next-smallest baby's this big.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.092
There's no way.

29:22.135 --> 29:25.472
Too small. My baby's too small.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.227
WOMAN: Baby Florio...

29:31.603 --> 29:32.479
MAN: Start CPR.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.817
Let's get an EPI, one CC...

29:39.778 --> 29:42.405
WOMAN (on PA)<i>:</i>
<i>Code blue, neonatal intensive-care unit.</i>

29:42.489 --> 29:43.782
<i>Stat-- code blue.</i>

29:44.699 --> 29:47.243
-NURSE: He's still flatline, Doctor.
-DOCTOR: Let's get an IV started.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.746
See? There.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.624
There. He's gone.

29:57.921 --> 29:58.755
Baby's gone.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.469
(sobs) He's gone!

30:07.972 --> 30:09.015
LUCY: Mrs. Florio.

30:09.307 --> 30:12.310
I, uh, wanted to thank you
and the other officer.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.271
I'm sorry about your loss.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.528
-We can do this another time--
-No, no, no. I wanted the statement.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.572
I hadn't decided to have that operation.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.534
This is about how you fell,

30:28.034 --> 30:29.786
in case someone is charged.

30:30.036 --> 30:30.954
(sobbing)

30:31.788 --> 30:33.832
I think we should just do
this another time.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.917
Would it be a crime if I had?

30:36.626 --> 30:40.505
He's out of work four and a half months.
We're gonna lose our house, I...

30:41.965 --> 30:42.799
Um...

30:44.133 --> 30:48.930
Our last one is special.
She's, uh, learning disabled.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.142
I was just so tired.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.189
I was so tired
that I didn't think I had the strength.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.733
You didn't have an abortion.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.904
And even if you did, that's your choice.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.908
You know, you forgive yourself,
Mrs. Florio.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.953
Nobody gets to sit in judgment on you.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.040
Hey.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.876
(door closes)

31:19.836 --> 31:20.920
I had him baptized.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.133
-Domenic Jr.
-(crying)

31:27.552 --> 31:30.179
It's okay, Annie.
I swear to God, I'll take care of you.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.557
Things will be all right.
I'll take care of you.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.392
-(both crying)
-I swear.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.646
(telephone ringing)

31:38.730 --> 31:39.689
(file cabinet thuds)

31:40.940 --> 31:42.692
-Hi.
-Hi, Henry.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.613
-Where's the divine Miss S.?
-Okay, Fay, time-out.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.740
I don't know what's going on with you,

31:48.823 --> 31:51.242
but the last time I checked,
I thought we were gonna be friends.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.703
We were... we will be.

31:54.537 --> 31:58.791
-Listen, I wish you nothing but happiness.
-You're gonna begrudge me even that much?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.293
(sighs)

32:00.376 --> 32:03.379
Okay, so maybe I'm a little jealous.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.049
I can't let that be my problem, Fay.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.843
The fact is, for once I am happy.

32:09.135 --> 32:10.762
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.015
Harry!

32:15.725 --> 32:19.354
How about you and me going out
and getting a malted after work?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.940
-A malted?
-A drink?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.817
-Okay.
-Great!

32:27.403 --> 32:28.571
Yo, lover.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.907
That bad, huh, man?

32:31.741 --> 32:33.660
B-minus, C-plus...

32:35.578 --> 32:36.496
maybe a "D."

32:38.706 --> 32:39.666
Maybe an "F."

32:41.501 --> 32:42.961
Maybe I'm gonna take poison.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.382
You wanted to see me, Mr. Ardrey?

32:50.885 --> 32:52.011
Are you the district attorney?

32:52.553 --> 32:54.389
Assistant district attorney, yes.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.809
I was told that the baby died.

32:58.851 --> 32:59.686
Yes, it did.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.985
My lawyer said we'll deny
the baby was alive

33:07.360 --> 33:09.487
at this hearing. I don't want that.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.490
It's an arraignment.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.659
You enter your plea.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.037
-You don't make your--
-I don't want this made into a game.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.331
I don't want the truth
twisted out of this.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.042
I'm standing here
with a voice inside my head

33:23.126 --> 33:25.503
screaming that every good
I ever did turned into evil.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.714
Great life defender.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.799
Not even married,
not even kids of his own.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.843
Can't even meet anybody's eyes.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.136
Maybe if he could meet somebody's eyes,

33:33.219 --> 33:34.721
maybe he would have seen
who was coming up the stairs.

33:34.804 --> 33:37.432
Then maybe he wouldn't have pushed
somebody he didn't even mean to.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.270
I must still that voice.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.856
That's the voice of distortion,

33:46.941 --> 33:47.775
of despair.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.279
I need to make sense of this.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.866
I-- What I need--
I need to make myself understood.

33:55.658 --> 33:58.703
-Look, I don't know what you want with me.
-I'll plead guilty.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.122
-Pardon?
-I'll plead guilty.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.957
If the baby's dead, I'll plead guilty.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.546
Mr. Ardrey, whether you realize it or not,

34:08.880 --> 34:10.506
we're in an adversary relationship.

34:10.590 --> 34:13.301
I don't think this conversation
should go any further

34:13.384 --> 34:14.218
without your lawyer being present.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.887
Please talk to me like a human being.

34:15.970 --> 34:19.223
I am. I'm telling you,
it's not responsible of me

34:19.307 --> 34:21.642
to let you say any more
until your lawyer's here.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.560
Okay.

34:23.686 --> 34:25.563
Okay. Never mind.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.231
Fine.

34:29.108 --> 34:31.110
(footsteps fading away)

34:31.903 --> 34:33.321
(gavel bangs)

34:33.654 --> 34:36.115
JUDGE: I want the ground rules
understood going in.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.452
No outbursts, no partisan
expressions of any sort,

34:39.535 --> 34:40.870
or the court will be cleared.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.208
Mr. Ardrey,

34:46.375 --> 34:48.795
you are charged with two counts
of felonious assault

34:48.878 --> 34:52.006
and one count of second-degree murder.
Do you understand these charges?

34:53.174 --> 34:54.258
I do, Your Honor.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.970
Do you wish to enter a plea?

35:00.598 --> 35:02.100
Guilty, Your Honor, with explanations.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.352
-Hold it. Your Honor--
-Please be quiet, Miss Chapman.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.104
I have decided
this is how I want to plead.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.605
Your Honor, may I speak?

35:07.980 --> 35:09.941
You may enter a plea.
Is that what you want to do?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.901
If I can explain afterwards.

35:11.984 --> 35:14.570
Oh, no, no, not at this hearing.
Subsequently, you may.

35:16.989 --> 35:17.824
Guilty.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.869
-Guilty as to all three counts?
-Yes, sir.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.371
I don't believe my client understands--

35:23.454 --> 35:25.206
Please don't speak for me. Don't talk law!

35:25.289 --> 35:27.500
This is a court of law, Mr. Ardrey.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.210
Do you understand
that by entering these pleas,

35:29.293 --> 35:30.211
you're gonna go to jail?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.921
I'm perfectly willing
to accept punishment,

35:32.004 --> 35:34.048
so long as my intentions
can be understood!

35:34.132 --> 35:36.217
-MISS CHAPMAN: Your Honor!
-Wait, wait! Damn it!

35:37.802 --> 35:41.472
Innocence or guilt
may turn on intention, Mr. Ardrey.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.141
I don't want you pleading guilty--

35:43.224 --> 35:44.684
I didn't intend to harm
that woman or her baby.

35:44.767 --> 35:48.396
Request please be withdrawn
as to these two charges, Your Honor.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.607
I am entering not guilty pleas
on all three counts.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.525
ARDREY: Wait!

35:52.608 --> 35:56.404
Now, you can change them
at a subsequent hearing.

35:56.904 --> 36:00.283
The court is not satisfied pleas
at this time would be informed.

36:00.366 --> 36:01.450
This is what I did.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.828
I got angry, and I threw the blood.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.873
And then I got angrier,
and I tried to hit the doctor,

36:06.956 --> 36:08.291
and my sign hit the woman.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.459
And she fell.

36:12.795 --> 36:13.796
And because of that...

36:15.423 --> 36:16.716
because of what I did...

36:19.260 --> 36:21.220
she had a premature baby
that couldn't live.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.023
All right.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.111
Arraigned without plea.
Released on recognizance.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.946
(paper rustles)

36:39.572 --> 36:40.615
It remains to be seen

36:41.574 --> 36:43.409
what court you're answerable to, sir.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.581
-All right, that's a recess.
-(gavel bangs)

36:50.041 --> 36:51.918
MAN: They shouldn't even let them picket.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.670
They shouldn't have been there.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.839
They were trying to cause trouble.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.885
REPORTER: Excuse me, uh, what's to be done
with the case now?

37:00.968 --> 37:04.096
I am certain with further reflection,
Mr. Ardrey will reconsider.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.557
At which point do you intend
to argue non-viability

37:06.641 --> 37:08.309
of the fetus as a defense?

37:08.392 --> 37:10.436
That's among our defenses, yes.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.688
What do you think of the irony
of a pro-life advocate

37:12.772 --> 37:15.483
defending himself by denying
the fetus's humanity?

37:15.566 --> 37:16.442
No comment.

37:16.525 --> 37:19.070
Excuse me, Attorney Chapman,
I'd like to talk with you.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.821
What's your problem?

37:21.697 --> 37:24.033
I happen to know your client

37:24.116 --> 37:26.494
specifically opposed you
using that argument.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.579
Oh! And how do you know that?

37:28.663 --> 37:29.747
Because he told me.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.916
I hate that man's position,

37:31.999 --> 37:35.044
but he deserves exactly
what you're depriving him of,

37:35.127 --> 37:37.088
his consistency and his sincerity.

37:37.171 --> 37:38.005
Look, I'm his lawyer--

37:38.089 --> 37:39.799
And a time may come for you
to make that defense.

37:40.424 --> 37:45.513
Trotting it out for the media is perverse,
and you're doing it to embarrass him.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.474
Look, I don't need your lectures, okay?

37:48.641 --> 37:50.559
(chattering)

37:53.604 --> 37:56.274
We're in agreement about this
from a quality standpoint?

37:56.357 --> 37:57.650
Larry, I'm sick about it.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.277
Hey, that's showbiz, babe.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.903
All the ingredients were there.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.655
Sometimes, your soufflé rises.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.533
Sometimes, you know,
you got a total collapse,

38:05.616 --> 38:07.076
-and there's muck all over the oven.
-(scoffs)

38:07.159 --> 38:08.536
Two grand worth.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.246
So, let me ask you this.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.581
Have you given any thought to plan B?

38:14.375 --> 38:15.501
I'm thinking about it.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.336
Okay, before you make up your mind,

38:17.712 --> 38:19.380
I've got these scenes written.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.841
I'm gonna leave you beautiful
individuals here.

38:21.924 --> 38:24.593
Talk it over, whatever you want.

38:25.177 --> 38:28.347
Rehearse, improvise, only not too much,

38:28.431 --> 38:30.266
'cause you don't want to leave your game
in the dressing room.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.434
You know what I mean?

38:32.310 --> 38:33.311
Uh...

38:35.104 --> 38:37.773
We don't have too many lines here, Larry.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.608
What's to say?

38:39.692 --> 38:42.153
These scenes do not further
the story, J.D.

38:42.528 --> 38:46.198
When I say, "action,"
this is the key word, okay?

38:46.282 --> 38:47.491
I'm right next door.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.535
You look out for our guy, Lulu.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.710
-Hi.
-Hi.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.378
MAN: This isn't the way we discussed it.

38:59.462 --> 39:00.796
This set is wrong. Where's Maurice?

39:01.505 --> 39:02.381
I, uh...

39:03.341 --> 39:06.677
guess the crew
and everyone's in here then, uh...

39:07.303 --> 39:08.304
during.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.723
Mm-hmm. You nervous, sweetie?

39:11.557 --> 39:12.600
Come on!

39:13.392 --> 39:16.896
Listen, I was nervous my first time, too.

39:17.229 --> 39:20.191
It was one of these
multiple-person scenarios.

39:20.274 --> 39:24.362
Must have been 35 people or more,
all together in one way or another.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.322
But, you know,
after a while, you just realize...

39:27.198 --> 39:30.201
Hey, we're all human.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.080
I don't know, Lulu.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.999
You're among friends.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.001
We all want you to do well.

39:39.543 --> 39:43.255
You know, this is a very
nonjudgmental environment.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.634
It's just acting, right?

39:46.842 --> 39:50.638
That's right, John.
And acting is believing.

39:51.263 --> 39:53.641
Now, what we need to do first...

39:53.891 --> 39:58.354
we need to have a clear idea
of what it is we're working with.

39:58.813 --> 40:02.316
You and me both.

40:04.652 --> 40:05.486
Huh.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.954
I like this Ardrey fella.

40:15.037 --> 40:18.290
First perp in a month,
all he wants to do is plead guilty.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.585
No deals, no hassles.
Just let me do my bit.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.753
They won't let him.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.506
It's more complicated than that, Renko.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.049
Listen, I'm on the guy's side.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.802
I married Daryl Ann
instead of having her have that abortion.

40:29.885 --> 40:32.012
I'm a happy man. I'm a happy man.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.059
Renko, what did you mean before,

40:37.143 --> 40:40.771
saying that this Black family that just
moved in here was just buying trouble?

40:41.105 --> 40:43.107
I meant that any father in his right mind

40:43.190 --> 40:45.526
wouldn't move his family
into this kind of situation.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.320
Some fathers want to make things better
for their children.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.364
I happen to be one of those fathers,

40:50.448 --> 40:52.074
and you don't get nowhere
butting your head

40:52.158 --> 40:53.701
against the status-quo
values of the community.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.245
Status-quo?
Then the status quo never changes.

40:56.328 --> 40:59.957
(sighs) Let somebody else change it, okay?
What are you getting worked up about?

41:00.040 --> 41:03.377
You just sounded pretty selfish, Renko.
It's like a sign in your voice--

41:03.461 --> 41:06.130
You say selfish, and I say realistic.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.090
And you say realistic, and I say redneck.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.508
What are you calling me
a redneck for, man?

41:09.592 --> 41:10.593
The front courtyard!

41:10.676 --> 41:12.678
Where in the hell do you get off
calling me a redneck?

41:12.761 --> 41:14.513
I'm trying to stand up for my own virtues!

41:14.597 --> 41:16.265
-Come on!
-MAN: Help! Someone's being robbed.

41:16.348 --> 41:19.477
-I'll be there!
-MAN: Help! Help!

41:21.687 --> 41:24.106
(man screams)

41:28.277 --> 41:29.528
RENKO: I'll take the alley.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.824
Ooh! Oh!

41:36.035 --> 41:38.287
Just settle back down, sir. What happened?

41:38.370 --> 41:42.082
I got robbed coming from the
laundry machines, white boy.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.459
Did you see where he went?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.002
Downstairs.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.671
-Okay, will you be all right?
-Uh, yeah.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.256
-Tell my partner.
-Yeah.

41:50.049 --> 41:50.925
(man groans)

42:28.712 --> 42:30.673
-(thuds)
-Ow! Renko!

42:30.756 --> 42:32.550
-(shouting)
-(grunting)

42:33.008 --> 42:34.426
(gunshot)

42:38.847 --> 42:39.807
(grunts)

42:44.478 --> 42:46.105
MAN: You were the first unit on the scene?

42:47.815 --> 42:50.067
You better come back with us
so we can get you fixed up.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.111
-I'm all right.
-No, regulations.

42:52.194 --> 42:55.030
You may have a concussion.
I'm gonna have to insist.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.533
I'll make it over on my own.

43:00.244 --> 43:02.621
MAN: Did you hear the number
of rounds that were fired?

43:03.372 --> 43:04.373
RENKO: Just one.

43:04.915 --> 43:07.459
-Excuse us a minute?
-We're done for now.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.420
Probably have more in the morning.

43:12.214 --> 43:14.466
You and me, Renko, over there.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.470
How you feeling?

43:20.264 --> 43:21.348
Feel all right?

43:22.725 --> 43:24.977
-Hear you got a concussion.
-Where were you?

43:25.561 --> 43:26.395
What do you mean?

43:26.645 --> 43:29.398
You know what I mean.
Where in the hell were you?

43:30.316 --> 43:31.442
I got there.

43:31.525 --> 43:33.319
Don't you tell me that.

43:35.070 --> 43:38.699
I had to see if the old man was all right,
and then I couldn't find the door.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.326
Don't you insult me, Renko.

43:42.244 --> 43:45.831
Look, if I was late, I'm sorry.
It turned out all right.

43:45.914 --> 43:47.541
I killed a kid!

43:47.875 --> 43:48.792
Don't--

43:53.589 --> 43:54.673
I'm sorry, Bobby.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.927
Sorry ain't good enough, Renko.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.513
Not for a partner.

44:10.564 --> 44:11.649
What the hell?

44:13.942 --> 44:15.611
(sighs) It's not life or death.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.947
It's a lousy ten frames of bowling,
for crying out loud.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.867
Bowling Federation, shmowling federation.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.704
So what if it's not sanctioned?
You know what you did.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.665
Something you dream about, though.

44:28.457 --> 44:32.378
Throwing like that,
hitting a rhythm like that. (chuckles)

44:32.461 --> 44:34.672
You know, I actually have
had dreams about it.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.006
Oh, you were on.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.509
-I was, wasn't I?
-You were perfect.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.010
Once in a lifetime.

44:40.094 --> 44:43.472
Mr. 300. That they can't
take away from you.

44:43.555 --> 44:44.556
They haven't.

44:46.475 --> 44:47.309
They won't.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.313
I got to go relieve myself.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.400
Pretend it's the guy
from the Bowling Federation.

44:56.235 --> 44:57.569
You sit there,

44:57.778 --> 45:01.407
you listen to people saying
that it's "this" to do it,

45:01.490 --> 45:02.533
and it's "that."

45:05.953 --> 45:07.830
You know 50 times better than them

45:10.290 --> 45:11.375
what it means.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.711
I mean, you know
what's growing inside you.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.298
And they're gonna tell you what it means?

45:20.509 --> 45:22.428
You got to listen to 80 different people.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.849
And none of them know
the feeling you got in your belly.

45:27.391 --> 45:28.976
They're gonna tell you what it means?

45:30.060 --> 45:31.478
You know what it means.

45:32.604 --> 45:33.981
You know what you're doing.

45:35.858 --> 45:36.942
You know what you did.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.779
And you know what's gone.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.785
Then you got to forgive yourself.

45:49.371 --> 45:51.665
And you forgive yourself,
because you got to go on.

45:56.754 --> 45:57.671
And...

46:00.424 --> 46:01.550
that's all there is to it.

46:02.885 --> 46:03.969
JOYCE: She terrified me.

46:04.720 --> 46:08.307
I listened to her making arguments

46:09.391 --> 46:11.977
like some brittle, intellectual game.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.271
(sighs)

46:14.980 --> 46:17.024
I didn't like her
from the day I met her here.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.402
But she had a big pair of shoes to fill.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.655
Are you saying I have big feet, Furillo?

46:24.031 --> 46:24.865
(scoffs)

46:26.200 --> 46:30.078
Having a conversation with you today
is like picnicking on a minefield.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.664
(laughs)

46:33.457 --> 46:35.042
you were right before, Frank.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.251
When?

46:37.085 --> 46:38.086
In your office.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.132
When you said I was acting out of anger.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.720
I didn't get less angry
as the day went on.

46:47.805 --> 46:48.722
(sighs)

46:49.556 --> 46:51.266
Then I saw that man in his cell...

46:52.142 --> 46:53.602
lonely and tormented.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.730
And I don't think...

46:59.399 --> 47:02.319
suffering any less or regretting any less

47:04.154 --> 47:06.198
than that poor woman or her family.

47:07.241 --> 47:10.202
I started wondering whether the law
could take in what was happening,

47:10.285 --> 47:12.579
or an outsider could really understand.

47:15.457 --> 47:17.960
When I was a beat cop
and had to watch a person die,

47:18.043 --> 47:19.294
there always came a point...

47:19.962 --> 47:21.380
I could see it in their eyes...

47:22.047 --> 47:23.715
when you weren't part of it anymore...

47:26.426 --> 47:27.970
what you were, what you could do.

47:30.013 --> 47:32.307
It was their own terrible,
solitary moment.

47:35.310 --> 47:36.144
But you were there.

47:36.895 --> 47:37.813
What would you do?

47:40.774 --> 47:42.317
Realize it wasn't your moment.

47:44.403 --> 47:46.530
Try not to disturb it or intrude on it.

47:47.614 --> 47:49.992
Then go home and be glad
somebody was waiting for you.

47:52.286 --> 47:53.245
And loved you.

48:03.088 --> 48:06.091
(closing theme playing)
