00:05.640 --> 00:07.080
GIGGLING

00:07.080 --> 00:08.880
Ssh! Ssh!

00:12.320 --> 00:14.920
THEY WHISPER

00:19.160 --> 00:20.440
Hello?

00:23.680 --> 00:25.640
Happy birthday, Alicia.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.080
THEY WHISPER

00:33.920 --> 00:36.360
ALL: Happy Birthday!

00:36.360 --> 00:38.760
THEY LAUGH

00:38.760 --> 00:42.240
You guys had me there
for a second.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.080
Oh, thank you.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.840
Wow.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.600
It's just something silly.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.680
Oh! Mary-Lou!

00:51.680 --> 00:52.720
What is it?

00:53.800 --> 00:56.560
This is your best work yet.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.960
Wouldn't you just love
to see their faces

00:59.960 --> 01:01.280
if they actually saw this?

01:01.280 --> 01:03.760
No, you absolutely mustn't.
No-one can see it.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.440
If Mademoiselle thinks we're making
fun of her, she'll be furious.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.600
Yes, please, promise you won't.

01:09.640 --> 01:13.200
OK, I won't show Mademoiselle.
But it is my birthday.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.640
Aren't I allowed a little fun?

01:14.640 --> 01:15.840
THEY GIGGLE

01:39.960 --> 01:42.760
I can't believe I thought we found
Lady Jane's box of jewels.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.520
You heard Miss Grayling, Darrell -
there is no treasure.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.360
We just have to come up with a new
plan to save the school.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.480
Look, as much as we want to help,

01:51.480 --> 01:54.480
we must trust Miss Grayling
will find a way.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.560
And she will.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.080
Gwendolyn, remember, we have
rehearsals this afternoon.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.760
Please make sure everything
is in order before I arrive.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.680
And I hope you've practised
your lines.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.000
Yes, of course.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.200
Also, I didn't have time to make
the bunting, so can you?

02:10.200 --> 02:12.400
Of course. Oh, you're a star.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.120
You have to help me learn
my lines after breakfast.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.640
I'm sorry, but I have to finish my
essay on the Battle of Agincourt.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.880
Oh, how tedious.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.200
Please, Mary-Lou,
this is far more important.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.680
You can't use people
as and when you want to, Gwen.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.200
I'm not.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.720
It's just, I have a lot on my plate
at the moment.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.200
Gwen, I can help you.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.280
No, thank you.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.360
Mary-Lou.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.560
I promised Gwen I wouldn't tell
anyone, but I know I can trust you.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.280
It's Gwen's father. He's not very
well, and she really wants

02:58.280 --> 03:00.760
to make him proud of the school
play if he can make it.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.400
I had no idea.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.080
Poor Gwen. Of course,
I'll help her with her lines.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.240
Irene?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.720
Jean.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.760
Darrell Rivers.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.760
Er, what about my hamper?

03:18.760 --> 03:21.760
My birthday hamper.
My parents send me one every year.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.600
Well, not this year.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.240
Now, come on, you should be grateful

03:25.240 --> 03:27.640
for the gifts
you've already received.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.800
They forgotten my birthday.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.920
I'm sure they haven't.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.960
Your hamper is probably
held up in the post.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.320
Where are you going?

03:41.320 --> 03:42.840
I left something in the dorm.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.880
I'll see you girls in class.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.720
How awful.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.760
Imagine your parents
forgetting your birthday.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.120
I must find a way to make
her day special.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.960
She'll never admit it, but I can see
she misses her family terribly.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.720
I have an idea.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.880
Spit it out.
I haven't got all day.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.880
We'd like to bake a cake for Alicia
in our house craft lesson.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.440
A cake?

04:13.440 --> 04:16.160
Yes, I'd like to marry Cary Grant,
but we can't have it all.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.320
Please. Alicia thinks her parents
forgot her birthday

04:18.320 --> 04:21.320
because she didn't receive
her usual hamper.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.040
A cake would really cheer her up.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.640
Very well.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.800
BOTH: Thank you.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.240
You can bake the cake if you can
find the ingredients.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.520
Ingredients?

04:30.520 --> 04:34.160
Eggs, flour, sugar, butter.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.720
What?

04:37.720 --> 04:40.480
You think I have them all stored
in the pantry?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.040
We are living off rations.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.160
No ingredients, no cake.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.560
Now, run along.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.920
How are we going to find
the ingredients?

04:50.920 --> 04:53.440
If only we could buy some, I know
the girls would pitch in.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.880
That's a great idea, but there's no
time to go to the village and back.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.560
BOTH: Ron!

05:00.560 --> 05:02.360
THEY LAUGH

05:08.680 --> 05:10.680
I don't understand
how I'm meant to learn my lines

05:10.680 --> 05:12.080
and make the bunting.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.280
It's unfair that Georgina's
expecting so much from you.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.400
I know you don't want to cause
a fuss, but if you told her

05:17.400 --> 05:19.520
about your father, I'm sure...
My father?

05:21.160 --> 05:22.720
I, er...

05:22.720 --> 05:25.040
Darrell told me
about him being ill.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.360
What?!

05:27.640 --> 05:29.520
She promised
she wouldn't tell anyone. I...

05:29.520 --> 05:32.160
She, she meant well.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.480
Meant well?!

05:33.480 --> 05:36.800
Listen here, Mary-Lou,
don't breathe a word of this.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.200
Of course, I won't.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.960
Please, Gwen,
don't be cross with her.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.720
She was only trying to help.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.400
I don't need Darrell's help.

05:44.400 --> 05:48.880
Please! I need to finish this book
by tomorrow and write up a critique.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.400
Sorry.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.280
Goodness! I wish I could be as
relaxed about work as you two -

05:57.280 --> 06:01.040
playing music and learning lines -
but some of us need to study.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.240
Yes. Sorry.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.240
She just finds it difficult
to concentrate.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.480
It's not the only thing
she finds difficult.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.480
She's awfully rude.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.760
I was going to turn it down.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.440
Ellen will have no friends with
such an attitude.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.880
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

06:31.680 --> 06:34.080
Jean, you seem to have cheered up.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.280
Has your hamper arrived?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.800
Hamper or not,
it's my birthday.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.520
I'm going to have fun,
one way or another.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.400
Alicia, fun is great,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.840
but promise me nobody's
going to get in trouble.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.520
She's up to something.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.000
Bonjour!

06:57.000 --> 07:00.480
Mademoiselle?
Er, where's Mr Parker?

07:00.480 --> 07:03.520
There's been a change in lessons
this morning.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.720
You lucky girls have French first.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.600
Now, hand over your prep,
s'il vous plait.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.120
Mr Parker would've found it funny.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.440
Mademoiselle isn't supposed
to see it.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.760
Merci.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.120
Merci, Alicia.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.920
Quick, take it down.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.080
Er, Mademoiselle...

07:34.080 --> 07:36.000
Oui, Darrell?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.120
It's Alicia's birthday today,

07:38.120 --> 07:41.640
so we'd love it if you could
teach us Happy Birthday in French.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.920
But of course.
What a wonderful idea.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.800
Sorry, Mademoiselle,
I seem to have dropped my pencil.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.480
Wait.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.400
Come join me at the front.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.000
Allez.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.520
Merci.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.600
Allez, allez. Merci.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.000
Mary-Lou.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.600
Here.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.920
Alors...

08:16.680 --> 08:17.880
Joyeux...

08:19.960 --> 08:21.800
..anniversaire.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.160
Come on.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.160
Girls, repeat after me.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.240
# Joyeux anniversaire

08:32.240 --> 08:36.520
# Joyeux anniversaire

08:36.520 --> 08:41.120
# Joyeux anniversaire, Alicia

08:41.120 --> 08:46.920
# Joyeux anniversaire. #

08:59.200 --> 09:01.640
Alicia. Alicia, we can't leave.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.840
What if Mademoiselle finds it?

09:02.840 --> 09:05.000
She'll be mortified to learn
I'm the one who drew it.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.040
Don't worry,
I'll come back and get it.

09:07.040 --> 09:11.000
Oh... Mary-Lou, I promise,
I won't let you get in trouble.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.560
Ron's family must be really good
friends with the grocer

09:28.560 --> 09:30.400
to get us butter and sugar
so quickly.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
We must be sure to save him
a slice.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.120
Right, girls, we are going to pick
up where we left off last week.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.920
May we bake a cake now?

09:37.920 --> 09:41.720
We were thinking a vanilla sponge
with chocolate buttercream, Matron.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.440
Well, I suppose a deal is a deal,

09:45.440 --> 09:47.800
and I wouldn't want
all of this to go to waste.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.960
Thank you, Matron.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.600
Where's Alicia Johns?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.600
Mademoiselle kept her back
to do her prep.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.040
She'll be here soon.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.000
Well, that girl could do
with some life skills,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.320
but I will excuse her for today.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.560
My goodness, I hope she
realises how lucky she is.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.040
Oh, you girls are spoilt.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.560
When I was your age, my mama
used to make us cakes

10:10.560 --> 10:11.800
out of beef dripping.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.640
Right,

10:14.640 --> 10:16.120
sift this into a bowl.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.800
Are those supposed to be triangles
Gwendoline?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.040
At your great age,

10:22.040 --> 10:24.480
you really ought to learn
how to use a pair of scissors.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.360
Look at this butter.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.400
HUMMING

10:45.360 --> 10:47.560
SHE CONTINUES HUMMING

10:50.880 --> 10:52.880
SHE STOPS HUMMING ABRUPTLY

11:00.240 --> 11:01.400
SHE GASPS

11:02.360 --> 11:04.000
Quelle horreur!

11:13.960 --> 11:15.360
Oh, can I smell it?

11:15.360 --> 11:17.320
Yes, you can smell it,
but do not...

11:17.320 --> 11:19.760
Ah, Miss Johns,
so good of you to join us.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.280
Hide it! Don't... Let her...
Where is the drawing? I tried to...

11:23.280 --> 11:25.040
Desole, Matron,

11:25.040 --> 11:27.800
but I need the girls back
in the classroom.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.520
All of you now.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.360
Excuse me, Miss Rougier, but
we are just in the middle of...

11:32.360 --> 11:33.480
Tout suite!

11:35.680 --> 11:37.080
Allez.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.720
You heard her. Off you go.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.840
I'm sorry.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.920
Well, I suppose we'll
finish baking the cake later?

11:48.920 --> 11:50.920
It seems you're in trouble, child.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.600
Do you really think
you deserve treats?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.840
Close the door on your way out.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.320
Allez.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.600
Mam'zelle...

12:11.600 --> 12:13.360
..whatever the matter is,

12:13.360 --> 12:15.880
I can assure you that
I've had no part in it.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.440
So, please may I be excused
for rehearsals?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.560
Asseyez toi.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.920
Allez.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.960
Qui a dessine ca?

12:36.880 --> 12:39.160
Irene, was this you?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.840
Did you do this because
I played a little prank myself

12:42.840 --> 12:44.240
with Mr Parker's note?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.360
Huh?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.200
Very well.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.000
No-one is to leave until
the coupable confesses.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.200
Oh.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.480
Oh!

13:26.840 --> 13:28.360
Ah...

13:34.360 --> 13:36.040
SHE SIGHS

13:49.240 --> 13:50.840
Mm...

13:59.680 --> 14:01.080
C'est de toi?

14:04.280 --> 14:05.680
You?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.280
Tell her.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.840
Silence!

14:09.840 --> 14:11.320
Mettez vos mains sur la tete.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.400
Allez!

14:16.120 --> 14:18.280
You English girls have no respect!

14:20.760 --> 14:23.920
Unless one of you confesses,
I will punish all of you.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.280
Starting with detention for a week.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.920
Is that what do you think of me?

14:29.920 --> 14:34.800
That I spend all my days running
away from spiders and Matron?

14:34.800 --> 14:36.280
No, of course not.

14:36.280 --> 14:39.320
I foolishly thought
you all respected me.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.480
But to see you have been mocking me
all this time!

14:42.480 --> 14:44.800
No, Mam'zelle, we really haven't.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.120
Well, one of you has!

14:49.640 --> 14:53.800
Just give me a name and
I won't punish the entire class.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.080
I see.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.800
I have to teach you to respect me.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.760
You will now have a French test.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.880
French test? I'm not ready
for a French test!

15:06.880 --> 15:08.920
Actually, no, no.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.880
You will have a test
in all of your subjects.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.840
I will speak to Miss Grayling
and make sure of it.

15:15.840 --> 15:20.560
Oh, and...and I will write to
each of your parents about this.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.200
Write to our parents?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.120
Please, Mam'zelle, you mustn't.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.920
I didn't draw the caricature.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.960
Please... Mam'zelle, it was me.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.320
It was meant to be a joke.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.200
A joke!

15:36.200 --> 15:38.720
You think I am a joke?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.880
And Matron - you want to
make fun of us?

15:44.160 --> 15:48.760
Let us see if Miss Grayling
finds your joke funny.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.600
Come with me. Mam'zelle, please,

15:50.600 --> 15:51.720
I'm sorry.

15:54.680 --> 15:58.000
I am disappointed in all of you.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.120
Out of my class! Allez!

16:03.560 --> 16:05.280
SHE SIGHS

16:05.280 --> 16:06.320
Oh!

16:14.480 --> 16:16.000
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

16:16.000 --> 16:18.080
I agree this is disrespectful,

16:18.080 --> 16:19.960
and I second your decision

16:19.960 --> 16:21.880
for an impromptu mid-term test...
Hm!

16:21.880 --> 16:23.920
..especially for the girls
who knew this.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.280
Although...

16:28.280 --> 16:30.680
..I must say, Alicia,
I didn't realise you were

16:30.680 --> 16:33.000
such a gifted artist. Artist?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.400
This is not art.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.680
I shall commend your art mistress
for the progress you've made.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.640
I would love to see more
of your drawings.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.200
In fact,
why don't we see right now?

16:44.480 --> 16:45.720
Draw me.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.760
I really prefer to work in private.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.880
Don't worry,
it'll be for our eyes only.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.520
Please.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.320
If you insist.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.520
You're late.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.960
It was Alicia's fault.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.000
She decided to play
the most awful prank.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.360
Is that the bunting?

17:29.360 --> 17:30.920
I haven't finished it yet.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.360
Oh, Gwendoline, you know the set
is just as important as the acting.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.000
Now, take your position
and let's start from the top.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.360
Um...one moment. Um...

17:42.680 --> 17:44.200
Do you not know your lines?

17:44.200 --> 17:47.000
No, no, I do.
It's just...I've had a lot to do.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.640
Making the bunting,
learning my lines,

17:49.640 --> 17:51.800
and Mam'zelle Rougier's
just set us tests.

17:56.880 --> 18:01.280
Georgina, it's not easy for me
to say this, and...

18:01.280 --> 18:03.960
please don't tell anyone.
It's just...

18:05.040 --> 18:07.880
..my father -
he's not very well at all,

18:07.880 --> 18:10.760
you see, and I'm ever
so nervous about him.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.200
I don't have time for melodrama,
Gwendoline.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.720
My papa says excuses
are for the week.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.640
Do you realise how fortunate
you are to have a part in my play?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.640
Now, pull yourself together.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.440
Otherwise I will have to
replace you.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.840
GIRLS LAUGHING

18:50.280 --> 18:51.720
KNOCKING ON DOOR

18:57.800 --> 18:59.360
What are you doing here?

18:59.360 --> 19:02.760
Oh, I, uh... Miss Grayling, I...

19:02.760 --> 19:04.840
Alicia... Oh, for goodness' sake!

19:07.200 --> 19:10.080
I found this one loitering outside,
Miss Grayling.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.840
It was me, I drew the caricature.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.560
Come in.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.240
Let's sort this out.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.800
I'm so sorry, I...I drew
the picture, not Alicia.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.720
If anyone should be getting
into trouble, it should be me.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.840
She's lying to protect her friend.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.200
I know Mary-Lou and...
..and this is not her.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.080
It seems it's not Alicia, either.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.400
Mary-Lou, my fille preferee!
How can you do this to me?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.240
Mam'zelle, please.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.560
We didn't mean to upset you.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.920
As I said, we only meant
for it to be a joke.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.640
Yes, we can see that.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.960
An unfortunate joke that was
played on the wrong person

20:09.960 --> 20:12.440
and for which there
will be consequences.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.560
You girls may leave now.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.880
Ah, I beg your pardon,
but what have I missed?

20:31.560 --> 20:32.880
This!

20:34.800 --> 20:36.200
Oh!

20:36.200 --> 20:38.240
Little Mary Lou drew this?

20:38.240 --> 20:41.080
She and Alicia
have made fools of us.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.520
I am shocked that Mary Lou let a
pencil run away with her.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.640
Oh, but do you not see
the funny side?

20:51.800 --> 20:55.160
What is this funny side
that the English speak of so much?

20:55.160 --> 20:56.520
It is not funny!

20:56.520 --> 20:58.240
Oh, come on.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.640
Look at me.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.280
SHE LAUGHS

21:01.280 --> 21:05.640
I do swear by a good dose of
cod liver oil!

21:05.640 --> 21:08.520
And I think you look
rather impressive, Miss Rougier.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.640
I think a test is enough
to teach the girls.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.800
They must realise
that they represent one another.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.240
What about Mary-Lou and Alicia?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.320
Extra prep, perhaps?

21:25.320 --> 21:28.000
Ah. Have no fear, Miss Rougier.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.640
I will arrange something suitable
for Mary-Lou and Alicia to do.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.240
I know Alicia was in the wrong,
but no-one deserves to be punished

21:58.240 --> 22:01.120
on their birthday. I mean, we
don't even have a cake for her now.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.400
I've got some cola cubes
we can share.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.880
I have some ginger snaps.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.480
Can you please be quiet?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.200
I'm trying to learn my lines.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.840
Georgina was furious with me
earlier.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.960
Just come, let me read with you.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.880
Don't you think you've done enough?

22:19.480 --> 22:22.520
Telling Mary Lou about my father
when you promised you wouldn't?

22:22.520 --> 22:25.280
I'm so sorry, Gwen.
I know I shouldn't have, but...

22:25.280 --> 22:28.200
..I know she wouldn't say anything,
I just wanted Mary-Lou to help you.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.280
Fine. Seeing as you want to.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.840
I do not want to see any creases.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.480
Matron, I'd like to apologise again.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.400
I'm truly upset
to have caused offence.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.720
Let that be a lesson to you.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.600
Oh, before I forget, Alicia,
your parents sent a telegram.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.800
There's been a delay but your
hamper will be arriving soon.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.000
Oh, that's great news!

23:01.000 --> 23:02.720
It doesn't really matter now.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.480
This has been the worst
birthday ever.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.080
SHE SIGHS

23:16.240 --> 23:17.960
I'm glad this day is almost over.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.120
I owe you all an apology,
especially you, Mary Lou.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.160
Apology accepted,
but no more tricks.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.200
That's a big ask.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.120
I'll think about it.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.600
Are you all right?

23:33.280 --> 23:36.400
I heard what Gwen said about me
in the common room earlier.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.320
I didn't mean to be rude.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.680
No-one really listens to Gwen.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.600
She's a fine one to talk anyway.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
Come on. Let's go over some maths.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.600
Oh!

23:47.600 --> 23:49.880
A birthday cake!

23:49.880 --> 23:54.400
I really should not be bringing
this to you at bedtime.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.320
But... Thank you so much!

23:56.320 --> 23:57.560
Um...

23:57.560 --> 24:00.120
Matron. Yes? Well,

24:00.120 --> 24:02.720
obviously, I had to grade
your efforts.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.360
THEY LAUGH

24:04.360 --> 24:06.720
You baked this for me?
That's what you were doing.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.680
Thank you. You really are the best.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.520
Make a wish. Come along now.
I don't have all evening.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.080
Blow out the candle, please, Alicia,
before I have to leave.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.240
ALL: Happy birthday!
