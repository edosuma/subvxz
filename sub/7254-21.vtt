How did you get roped into bringing the cake to your parents' party?

00:45.225 --> 00:49.059
I made the mistake of telling my mother how much Rory loves the chocolate-raspberry one from Weston’s.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.335
-Ah! That’s my favorite.
-I know me too. So now I'm allowed to handle the cake.

00:52.336 --> 00:54.735
Drycleaners, help me remember to pick up my dress from the dry cleaners.

00:54.736 --> 00:55.635
Dry cleaners -- got it.

00:55.636 --> 00:59.017
And heels -- I need to find a pair of heels that will not sink into the grass

00:59.018 --> 01:01.000
at Yale. It’s all grass at Yale,

01:01.001 --> 01:04.177
unless it’s cobblestones. Between the grass and the cobblestones, you can't barely walk around there.

01:04.178 --> 01:07.101
So in fact don't help me remember heels. Help me remember wedges.

01:07.102 --> 01:08.144
Dry cleaners and wedges.

01:08.145 --> 01:10.114
Thank you so much for helping me.

01:10.115 --> 01:15.074
I have so much on my mind between Rory’s graduation and Logan asking me for her hand.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.592
Ooh, Champagne and ice -- I need to bring both of those to Yale.

01:17.593 --> 01:19.145
Dry cleaners, wedges, champagne, and ice.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.894
-Although everyone knows it’s a rhetorical question…

01:20.895 --> 01:21.350
ha?

01:21.351 --> 01:24.468
Logan asking my permission. Have you ever heard of anyone who says no?

01:24.469 --> 01:25.460
Why did you want to say no?

01:25.461 --> 01:27.857
No, he can ask her anything he wants.

01:27.858 --> 01:30.375
I think she’s too young to get married but, oh

01:30.376 --> 01:33.520
Plastic champagne flutes -- I can't forget those.

01:33.521 --> 01:35.646
I know he asked me out of respect,

01:35.647 --> 01:40.292
but I'll tell you what’s not respectful is asking for my permission and then making me wait.

01:40.293 --> 01:44.233
Every time the phone rings, I think it’s gonna be her, telling me that it’s happened, but it’s not.

01:44.234 --> 01:48.781
It’s just my mother calling with some boring party detail, like asking me about the ratio of devil to egg.

01:48.782 --> 01:51.927
Ooh, that’s easy. It’s one part yolk and two parts mayonnaise. Oh my God

01:51.928 --> 01:54.354
- you don't care at all, do you?
- No. - No.

01:55.601 --> 01:57.231
Ooh I have to remember my beaded clutch.

01:57.232 --> 01:59.684
Don't let me forget my beaded clutch.
Got it.

01:59.685 --> 02:01.393
Hey, Sue. I'm here to pick up the cake.

02:01.394 --> 02:03.220
Oh great. Thanks.

02:03.221 --> 02:07.234
And then, on top of everything, there’s this whole Luke thing.

02:07.235 --> 02:11.593
Oh, thank god. I have been waiting and waiting all morning.

02:11.594 --> 02:15.024
I didn't think you were gonna say anything, and then I didn't think I should say anything. So

02:15.768 --> 02:16.994
there is a Luke thing?

02:16.995 --> 02:19.707
I don't know Sookie. I can't figure out what happened. I mean

02:19.708 --> 02:21.991
clearly something came up when I sang that song.

02:21.992 --> 02:22.799
Clearly.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.638
But I don't know if it was a new, now feeling or the residue of an old feeling that came up

02:26.639 --> 02:28.948
because of the drinks and the lyrics and the hat.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.189
That was a deadly cocktail.

02:30.190 --> 02:37.526
So that’s why I'm going to the diner today -- to see how I feel, sober
and without the lyrics of "I will always love you" streaming in front of me.

02:37.527 --> 02:39.229
Gotcha. But just so you know

02:39.230 --> 02:42.203
I think it was a new, now feeling. The way you were singing to him...

02:42.204 --> 02:44.930
Sookie you weren't even there.
I know but I had enough people describe it to me.

02:44.931 --> 02:45.856
Oh, no!

02:45.857 --> 02:48.426
No we're just excited for the possibility of you and Luke.

02:48.427 --> 02:50.657
Look I know everyone’s heart is in the right place, but

02:50.658 --> 02:52.250
I need to figure out what I want.

02:52.251 --> 02:52.941
Gotcha.

02:52.942 --> 02:56.503
Seriously Sookie I need your help – keeping all these people off my back.

02:56.504 --> 02:57.522
Understood.

02:57.523 --> 03:01.697
But, for the future, the next time you want other people to stay out of your relationship…

03:01.698 --> 03:03.445
Don't serenade your ex in front of the whole town?

03:03.446 --> 03:05.247
You admit it was a serenade.

03:05.248 --> 03:06.590
Sookie...
Sorry.

03:06.591 --> 03:08.861
There you go.
Thanks.

03:08.862 --> 03:10.935
All right, We can check the cake off our list.

03:10.936 --> 03:12.490
What else do I need to remember?

03:12.491 --> 03:15.021
Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically.

03:15.022 --> 03:16.104
What?

03:16.105 --> 03:19.797
Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically.

03:19.798 --> 03:21.050
Huh?

03:21.051 --> 03:22.720
It’s a mnemonic device.

03:22.721 --> 03:26.257
Dress, wedges, champagne, ice, plastic flutes, beaded clutch.

03:26.258 --> 03:27.483
"Beaded clutch" is one word.

03:27.484 --> 03:28.918
And panty hose.

03:28.919 --> 03:32.860
Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically, Polly.

03:32.861 --> 03:34.830
And tissues and my camera.

03:34.831 --> 03:40.207
"Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically," Polly teased Chad.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.883
Why would Polly tease Chad about preferring footballs?

03:42.884 --> 03:45.036
I don't know. Maybe Polly prefers soccer balls.

03:45.037 --> 03:46.079
That doesn't make any sense.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.003
Well then stop adding stuff to the list.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.258 --> 04:43.989
Hiya.

04:43.990 --> 04:47.498
It’s so great to see you.
Wow! This place looks totally different.

04:47.499 --> 04:49.175
Well T.J. And I fixed it up.

04:49.176 --> 04:50.610
You guys did a really great job.

04:50.611 --> 04:54.865
Thanks we worked our butts off, but it came out really nice.
What’s gonna go here?

04:54.866 --> 04:56.796
Nothing. T.J. Put those up.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.448
Yeah didn't want to tempt fate, huh?

04:59.449 --> 05:03.668
Well, you know, he means well. He also built this coat-rack lamp, and it works.

05:03.669 --> 05:05.221
Nice.

05:05.696 --> 05:10.460
So, what brings you here?
Well you know I want to get Rory a graduation gift,

05:10.461 --> 05:13.446
and I just thought earrings might be the right thing you know.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.213
Cool. I got a whole lot of them, take a look around.

05:16.214 --> 05:20.769
So I heard about Lorelai’s karaoke serenade.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.678
I wish I had been there.
It wasn't a serenade.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.806
That’s not what I heard.

05:25.807 --> 05:29.525
I was at Weston’s a couple of days ago, and half the town was talking about it.

05:29.526 --> 05:32.109
Well half the town should get a hobby. What do you think about these?

05:32.110 --> 05:34.614
Ah, those aren't Rory’s taste.

05:34.615 --> 05:38.616
They're too trippy. She’s not trippy.

05:38.617 --> 05:39.829
So, what have you done?

05:39.830 --> 05:41.355
What do you mean, what have I done?

05:41.356 --> 05:42.647
About the love serenade.

05:42.648 --> 05:45.387
It wasn't a serenade, and I haven't

05:45.388 --> 05:48.910
done anything. I've worked real hard to try to get that stupid song out of my head.

05:48.911 --> 05:51.050
Aren't you gonna respond in some way?

05:51.051 --> 05:55.957
Well there’s nothing to respond to. She drank a truckload of tequila, and she sang a sappy song.

05:55.958 --> 05:57.681
Oh no. Time. Okay.

05:57.682 --> 06:02.848
"I will always love you" is not a sappy song. It’s classic Cyndi Lauper.

06:02.849 --> 06:03.800
Whitney Houston.

06:03.801 --> 06:09.333
It doesn't matter. The point is, she will always love you.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.468
I heard the song.

06:10.469 --> 06:12.531
She’s waiting for you to make a move.

06:12.532 --> 06:16.275
Look if it had meant something, she would have come in, you know. What do you think of these?

06:16.276 --> 06:18.363
The teardrops -- Rory will love those.

06:18.364 --> 06:19.805
Good.

06:19.806 --> 06:21.854
Look, all I'm saying

06:21.855 --> 06:24.254
is, from everything I've heard and know,

06:24.255 --> 06:26.342
Lorelai would like you to respond.

06:26.343 --> 06:30.963
I mean Crazy Carrie was there, and she said Lorelai definitely gave you the love look.

06:30.964 --> 06:34.148
I wouldn't trust information coming from a woman who wears a cardboard hat.

06:34.149 --> 06:36.587
You got a box for those?
I certainly do.

06:36.588 --> 06:39.953
You like that?
Yeah. Well, it’s nice.

06:39.954 --> 06:43.879
It is. It would really match Lorelai’s eyes.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.250
In fact, I was actually thinking of Lorelai when I made that.

06:47.251 --> 06:49.559
Well, I wasn't thinking --

06:49.560 --> 06:51.999
it’s a nice necklace, is all.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.627
It is. All right.

06:55.628 --> 06:58.145
This is on me.
Oh, what? No, no. Come on.

06:58.146 --> 07:00.717
After everything you've done for me...
I'm not gonna not pay.

07:00.718 --> 07:03.261
After everything’s T.J.’s put you through?

07:03.262 --> 07:05.479
That’s very nice of you.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.434
You know what? Maybe I will get this necklace as a backup for Rory.

07:09.435 --> 07:12.057
Right.
yeah and she has blue eyes, right?

07:12.058 --> 07:14.378
Yes, she does.

07:14.379 --> 07:15.370
Find a box for that.

07:15.371 --> 07:18.736
Yes, we still have the kitchen table, but the chairs went about a half-hour ago.

07:18.737 --> 07:22.922
Yeah let me stop you right there if you want to haggle, go to a flea market, because my other line is ringing.

07:22.923 --> 07:26.666
Fine. It’s yours. Be here in 20 minutes, or I'll reactivate the listing.

07:26.667 --> 07:30.816
Sold for $15 more than I paid 2 years ago see, the key to haggling

07:30.817 --> 07:33.360
is you put your hands around their throat and keep on squeezing.

07:33.361 --> 07:34.587
You've got skills, baby.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.115
I know. Think of how useful I'll be when we're in India.

07:37.116 --> 07:38.929
Oh remind me -- we have to pack Advil.

07:38.930 --> 07:41.982
If I get a headache over there, I'm not about to get some Ayurvedic massage.

07:41.983 --> 07:46.078
Sure, just to clarify, you are gonna tame it down a little
when we're in India, right? I mean we are tourists.

07:46.079 --> 07:49.992
No way. My philosophy is "travel aggressively."
Otherwise, you get taken advantage of.

07:49.993 --> 07:53.325
All these textbooks, backpacking?
I thought we agreed this is a vacation.

07:53.326 --> 07:56.274
I'm not about to drop the ball now that I've gotten into Harvard medical school.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.727
This is the time to turn up the intensity.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.903
Paris...
It’s not gonna be like this forever,

08:00.904 --> 08:05.444
I promise, but these next four years are critical. I've
got to do well so I can get a great to tier residency.

08:05.445 --> 08:08.053
After that, I promise I'll rest.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.082
What? Why are you smiling?

08:10.083 --> 08:14.004
Because I love you.
Shut up. I love you, too.

08:15.610 --> 08:18.311
Happy last day! Oh. Well, hello, lovebirds.

08:18.312 --> 08:19.785
Where were you?

08:19.786 --> 08:24.352
I went to a theater party with Lucy and Olivia,
and I spent the night at their place.

08:24.353 --> 08:26.284
Hey, Doyle.
Hey, Rory.

08:26.285 --> 08:28.887
Ah man, you guys are almost done packing up your stuff?

08:28.888 --> 08:29.735
Getting there.

08:29.736 --> 08:33.546
Can you believe we graduate tomorrow? I can't believe it. I can't wrap my head around it.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.417
Oh God. You're not gonna start getting sentimental already, are you?

08:36.418 --> 08:38.102
That wasn't sentimental. That was incredulous.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.568
I'm allowed to be incredulous.
I mean can you believe it?

08:40.568 --> 08:44.234
Ah yeah, I can, actually. I checked out of this place the second I got into Harvard.

08:44.235 --> 08:46.293
God, I never get tired of saying that.

08:46.294 --> 08:49.424
Well, I can't believe it, and I intend to savor every moment of it.

08:49.425 --> 08:50.989
Well, savor while you spackle

08:50.990 --> 08:54.184
I will take you to small-claims court if I don't get back my full deposit.

08:54.185 --> 08:57.558
Hey, do you need any boxes?
Someone overestimated.

08:57.559 --> 08:58.523
Let it go, Paris.

08:58.524 --> 09:02.393
Ah no, I'm just taking all my stuff back home, so I'm just gonna throw it all in suitcases.

09:02.394 --> 09:05.655
You know what I should take a picture
of you packing up the apartment.

09:05.656 --> 09:07.052
And that’s not sentimental?

09:07.053 --> 09:11.253
Oh, shush. I'm allowed a little bit of sentiment on my last day of college. Now smile.

09:11.254 --> 09:14.413
Are you done?
No, no. I need a picture of Doyle.

09:14.414 --> 09:18.040
He’s packing up the toaster. Oh, no toast tomorrow. That’s so sad.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.031
Rory.

09:19.032 --> 09:21.003
One more of you with that annoyed face.

09:21.004 --> 09:23.886
That’s not cute. Make the annoyed face again

09:23.887 --> 09:26.797
Oh, you're so good. You're a natural. I love it.

09:33.342 --> 09:36.381
Oh, hey.
Hello!

09:36.382 --> 09:38.522
He’s upstairs. I'm sure you can go right on up.

09:38.523 --> 09:40.322
Oh no that’s okay. I'm just here for coffee.

09:40.323 --> 09:42.469
Sure you are.
I am.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.707
Honey, we were there.
We heard the song.

09:44.708 --> 09:48.229
It gave me goose bumps.
The way you locked eyes with him.

09:48.230 --> 09:51.260
All of that pent-up emotion -- ooh.

09:51.261 --> 09:53.152
No, no, no. It’s just karaoke.

09:53.153 --> 09:57.783
You know I got swept up in the lyrics and the moment. It didn't mean anything.

09:57.784 --> 09:59.349
What can I get for you?

09:59.350 --> 10:02.298
Hi. Um, a coffee.
To go, right?

10:02.299 --> 10:05.064
Okay.
Is Rory all excited?

09:59.285 --> 10:01.030
Hi. Um, a coffee.

10:01.031 --> 10:02.245
To go, right?

10:02.246 --> 10:03.060
Okay.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.060
Is Rory all excited?

10:05.061 --> 10:06.315
Um yeah. She is.

10:06.316 --> 10:09.271
I can't believe she’s done. I still got memories of her

10:09.272 --> 10:10.966
as a little girl running around in my head.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.092
Me too.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.312
Hey, should I have a doughnut or a muffin?

10:16.313 --> 10:16.978
Whatever you want.

10:16.979 --> 10:19.066
How about a doughnut with a side of muffin?

10:21.805 --> 10:24.527
So, uh, what time are we supposed to be there, anyway?

10:24.528 --> 10:25.802
- Where?
- Yale.

10:25.803 --> 10:27.351
Oh, yeah, hon, I need directions,

10:27.352 --> 10:29.908
'cause Morey MapQuested it, but the campus is big.

10:29.909 --> 10:31.427
I didn't know you guys all wanted to come.

10:31.428 --> 10:33.351
Of course we do.

10:33.352 --> 10:36.019
We wouldn't miss our little girl’s graduation.

10:36.020 --> 10:38.283
Oh well I have to call her and see,

10:38.284 --> 10:39.644
make sure there’s enough tickets.

10:39.645 --> 10:40.570
Thanks, doll.

10:40.571 --> 10:41.855
How many do you think we need?

10:41.856 --> 10:43.975
Well, let’s see. There’s Morey and me and you

10:43.976 --> 10:47.629
and Lane and Zach and Mrs. Kim

10:47.630 --> 10:50.937
Lulu and Gypsy, plus one, she said.

10:50.938 --> 10:52.093
That’s a lot of people.

10:52.094 --> 10:54.181
Yeah maybe we should charter a van.

10:54.182 --> 10:56.712
Ooh, speaking of the graduate.

10:56.713 --> 10:58.412
Say hello to her from us!

10:58.413 --> 10:58.890
I will.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.603
And ask her how long the ceremony is,

11:00.604 --> 11:02.128
'cause I got to plan my snacks.

11:03.753 --> 11:04.269
Hey!

11:04.270 --> 11:06.063
Hey. You are not gonna believe it!

11:06.064 --> 11:07.354
Okay. Hold on.

11:09.530 --> 11:10.456
Believe what?

11:10.457 --> 11:13.175
Milan Kundera is speaking at our graduation.

11:13.176 --> 11:14.286
- Oh.
- What?

11:14.287 --> 11:15.565
You're not a big Kundera fan?

11:15.566 --> 11:18.368
Uh, no. I'm unbearably light on him.

11:18.369 --> 11:19.166
I see.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.148
Speaking of which,

11:20.149 --> 11:22.002
do you think you can get some more graduation tickets?

11:22.003 --> 11:23.524
It seems like the whole of stars hollow wants to come.

11:23.525 --> 11:25.797
Oh, that’s sweet, but we only get four,

11:25.798 --> 11:28.072
and people have been trying to get extra ones since September.

11:28.073 --> 11:29.735
Oh, no. Anything on the black market?

11:29.736 --> 11:31.750
No I think we're probably priced out of that.

11:31.751 --> 11:33.767
All right well, you do know the house is gonna get egged.

11:33.768 --> 11:35.204
I'm sorry. There’s nothing I can do.

11:35.205 --> 11:36.436
I'll help you scrub it when I get home.

11:36.437 --> 11:37.398
Wait a minute. Four?

11:37.399 --> 11:40.190
There’s me, your dad, your grandparents, Logan.

11:40.191 --> 11:41.500
Logan’s sitting with his friends

11:41.501 --> 11:43.577
there’re like 20 guys he hasn't seen since last spring.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.735
Mm gotcha.

11:44.736 --> 11:46.049
So, are you nervous?

11:46.050 --> 11:47.606
About Logan seeing his friends? Not really.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.929
No. About seeing dad.

11:48.930 --> 11:51.275
Oh, that. No.

11:51.276 --> 11:54.113
Ah we talked last night, mostly about our beautiful daughter.

11:54.114 --> 11:54.832
Oh.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.110
We're both just so proud of you.

11:56.111 --> 11:57.236
I think we're gonna be fine.

11:57.237 --> 11:58.770
Good. What about Luke?

11:58.771 --> 12:01.304
Oh, well, I was just in there, you know.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.817
Trying to figure out how I feel.

12:02.818 --> 12:03.190
And?

12:03.191 --> 12:04.606
And the point is totally moot,

12:04.607 --> 12:06.389
because he barely even looked at me.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.022
What?

12:07.023 --> 12:09.251
Yeah I must have completely embarrassed him,

12:09.252 --> 12:11.327
in addition to completely embarrassing myself.

12:11.328 --> 12:13.480
I've given you the "don't drink to excess" speech, right?

12:13.481 --> 12:16.140
Well if you haven't, you've certainly taught me by example.

12:16.141 --> 12:18.178
So, anyway, that’s that.

12:18.179 --> 12:19.093
Are you okay?

12:19.094 --> 12:23.742
Oh, yeah. I mean, I didn't know what I wanted, anyway, so...

12:23.743 --> 12:25.061
Okay if you need anything...

12:25.062 --> 12:26.223
Yeah. Thanks, hon.

12:26.224 --> 12:27.381
All right listen I'm gonna go.

12:27.382 --> 12:30.161
Logan and I have this romantic afternoon planned.

12:30.162 --> 12:31.554
Oh? Really?

12:31.555 --> 12:32.598
We're spackling.

12:32.599 --> 12:35.777
Oh. Well, spackle well,

12:35.778 --> 12:37.988
or whatever one says to encourage a successful spackle.

12:37.989 --> 12:38.832
Have a good spackle?

12:38.833 --> 12:39.642
Spackle on.

12:39.643 --> 12:40.401
Break a spackle?

12:40.402 --> 12:42.067
Knock on spackle if things work out.

12:42.068 --> 12:43.123
Okay I'll talk to you later.

12:43.124 --> 12:44.167
Tell him I said hi.

12:44.168 --> 12:45.375
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.589
all right, everybody! That’s enough!

12:50.590 --> 12:51.832
The meeting has come to order.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.912
Now before we get down to official business,

12:53.913 --> 12:56.316
I would like to unofficially thank all of you

12:56.317 --> 12:58.275
for your concerns over my health.

12:58.276 --> 13:00.187
I'm doing much better, thank you.

13:00.188 --> 13:01.592
We never heard. What did you do?

13:01.593 --> 13:02.308
Yeah what happened?

13:02.309 --> 13:03.967
I heard you slipped in the tub.

13:03.968 --> 13:05.293
That’s right, I did.

13:05.294 --> 13:07.310
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

13:07.311 --> 13:09.774
Bathroom safety is a serious business.

13:09.775 --> 13:11.293
One can never be too careful.

13:11.294 --> 13:12.360
Now, onto…

13:12.361 --> 13:14.959
I thought the paramedics found you in your living room.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.891
Well, yes. The tub was, in fact, a pedi-spa.

13:17.892 --> 13:19.589
I have bunions, and I was soaking,

13:19.590 --> 13:22.205
but it still was exceedingly slippery.

13:22.206 --> 13:24.396
Onto the next order of business.

13:24.397 --> 13:28.533
Our esteemed friend and neighbor Kirk would like a permit

13:28.534 --> 13:31.777
to do his performance-art piece called

13:31.778 --> 13:34.076
"Kirk-in-a-box" in the town square.

13:34.077 --> 13:35.988
It isn't a performance-art piece.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.569
It is a feat of endurance

13:37.570 --> 13:39.994
an attempt to stretch the bounds of human possibility.

13:39.995 --> 13:42.196
And what exactly is "Kirk-in-a-box"?

13:42.197 --> 13:44.589
I will be suspended 20 feet above the street

13:44.590 --> 13:47.437
in a clear Lucite box with no food or water.

13:47.438 --> 13:48.715
Like David Blaine.

13:48.716 --> 13:50.329
Not at all. My box is smaller.

13:50.330 --> 13:50.875
Why?

13:50.876 --> 13:52.693
Because Lucite is very costly.

13:52.694 --> 13:54.382
No. Why are you doing it?

13:54.383 --> 13:55.737
To see if I can.

13:55.738 --> 13:58.611
Let me point out that something like this could draw a crowd.

13:58.612 --> 14:01.588
Hey if Kirk wants to sit in a box, let him sit in a box.

14:01.589 --> 14:02.851
Yeah, what do we care?

14:02.852 --> 14:04.670
Yeah you don't have to look.

14:04.671 --> 14:06.485
It’s a good idea! Let’s vote!

14:06.486 --> 14:08.253
Very well. All those in favor.

14:09.567 --> 14:11.878
All right, all right. But don't complain to me

14:11.879 --> 14:14.980
when and if we run into a parking situation…

14:14.981 --> 14:16.951
Is there special parking at Yale?

14:16.952 --> 14:19.391
Oh, I meant to tell you. I couldn't get any extra tickets.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.145
What? We don't get to go to Rory’s graduation?

14:22.146 --> 14:22.869
I tried.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.450
Isn't there anything you can do?

14:24.451 --> 14:25.388
Well I asked.

14:25.389 --> 14:27.488
Excuse me, ladies. What is going on over there?

14:27.489 --> 14:30.262
None of us gets to go to Rory’s graduation.

14:30.263 --> 14:31.799
I'm sorry. I tried.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.022
Order! Order! Everyone, quiet down.

14:35.023 --> 14:37.643
Clearly, this is an issue of importance to some of you,

14:37.644 --> 14:39.696
so let’s just add it to tonight’s agenda.

14:39.697 --> 14:41.737
No, no, no. Taylor, we don't have to do that.

14:41.738 --> 14:44.095
Too late. It’s already been added.

14:44.096 --> 14:45.368
Lorelai, state your case.

14:45.369 --> 14:46.681
I don't have a case.

14:46.682 --> 14:49.661
Fine. Then just explain how this mishap occurred.

14:49.662 --> 14:50.687
What mishap?

14:50.688 --> 14:52.060
Clearly, you dropped the ball.

14:52.061 --> 14:54.359
I didn't. They get four per kid.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.593
That’s how it works. What could I do? I tried.

14:56.594 --> 14:58.963
Were there no orphans, no children of divorce?

14:58.964 --> 15:01.447
Are you telling me that every single student at Yale

15:01.448 --> 15:04.447
has at least four people coming to see him or her graduate?

15:04.448 --> 15:08.119
Look, I'm sorry okay, but you'll all get a chance to congratulate her

15:08.120 --> 15:10.415
at the graduation party I'm having at my house in a week.

15:10.416 --> 15:12.031
But it’s not the same thing.

15:12.032 --> 15:14.236
We've all known the kid since she was that high.

15:14.237 --> 15:17.705
We want to see that special moment when she gets handed her diploma.

15:17.706 --> 15:19.661
I'm really sorry, guys. I mean

15:19.662 --> 15:22.052
maybe I could hand her the diploma again you know,

15:22.053 --> 15:23.424
at the party at my house.

15:23.425 --> 15:25.283
- You would do that?
- Of course.

15:25.284 --> 15:26.292
Well what about the music?

15:26.293 --> 15:28.494
You can't have the pomp without the circumstance.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.867
That’s an easy one to solve.

15:29.868 --> 15:31.626
The stars hollow high school band will play.

15:31.627 --> 15:35.151
It will be a wonderful dress rehearsal for their own ceremony in two weeks.

15:36.559 --> 15:40.084
I don't know if I can fit the whole band inside the house.

15:40.085 --> 15:42.274
Absolutely not -- your house is not zoned

15:40.085 --> 15:42.274
Absolutely not -- your house is not zoned

15:42.275 --> 15:44.374
for gatherings larger than 15 people.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.052
We'll do it in the town square.

15:47.128 --> 15:48.606
Oh, that sounds…

15:48.607 --> 15:51.192
Lulu can play Rory. She’s a terrific actress.

15:51.193 --> 15:52.764
What are you, nuts? No way.

15:52.765 --> 15:54.172
Rory’s gonna play Rory.

15:54.173 --> 15:56.483
Oh, and at the ceremony at Yale,

15:56.484 --> 15:57.966
don't forget to take a lot of pictures,

15:57.967 --> 16:00.008
'cause then we can blow them up for the re-enactment!

16:00.009 --> 16:01.556
Uh, uh, okay.

16:01.557 --> 16:04.178
I would suggest taking a notebook along.

16:04.179 --> 16:07.204
Attention to detail is very important in re-enactments.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.371
We'd love to have you back at the D.A.R.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.752
So much, you were a breath of fresh air.

16:14.753 --> 16:16.861
We want to start a little outreach program.

16:16.862 --> 16:19.181
You wouldn't believe your generation’s apathy

16:19.182 --> 16:21.251
when it comes to such things

16:21.252 --> 16:22.400
as the preservation of this nation’s history.

16:22.401 --> 16:24.336
Oh really yeah that’s a shame.

16:24.337 --> 16:26.421
We were thinking of renting out a roller rink…

16:26.422 --> 16:29.330
I'm sorry, ladies. Mind if I steal my girlfriend away for a minute?

16:29.331 --> 16:30.562
Some rather urgent business.

16:30.563 --> 16:31.811
Of course not.

16:31.812 --> 16:34.134
- We'll talk later.
-  Excuse me.

16:34.135 --> 16:36.386
Oh you really are my shining, armored knight. You know that.

16:36.387 --> 16:37.694
I saw you dying,

16:37.695 --> 16:39.415
and I did want to tell you something rather urgent.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.154
What’s up?

16:40.155 --> 16:42.192
- You look beautiful.
- Oh!

16:44.230 --> 16:46.119
I just can't believe you're old enough

16:46.120 --> 16:47.691
to have a daughter in college.

16:47.692 --> 16:48.817
- Yeah…
- Neither can I.

16:48.818 --> 16:50.705
What is your skin-care ritual?

16:50.706 --> 16:52.318
Oh, just soap, you know?

16:52.319 --> 16:53.163
What kind?

16:53.164 --> 16:54.931
I just get it at the drugstore.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.163
Will you excuse me?

16:56.761 --> 16:57.700
Chris, hi.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.547
- Where are you going?
-  I'll be right back.

17:02.374 --> 17:03.700
That wasn't the question.

17:03.701 --> 17:06.339
Where are you? Oh. There you are.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.213
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:08.214 --> 17:10.801
Sorry. I just didn't want to do this in front of everyone.

17:10.803 --> 17:13.861
No, no. I think that’s a good thing.

17:13.862 --> 17:15.941
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:16.534 --> 17:17.683
You look good.

17:17.684 --> 17:19.490
You look good.

17:20.263 --> 17:21.285
So, how is she?

17:21.286 --> 17:24.217
Oh, she’s excited. She’s good. She’s excited.

17:24.218 --> 17:25.137
Yeah? And you?

17:25.138 --> 17:28.809
I'm excited, sad, and nostalgic.

17:28.810 --> 17:29.695
Terrified.

17:29.696 --> 17:32.839
Logan asked my permission to ask her to marry him.

17:33.598 --> 17:35.147
- What?
- Yeah. I know.

17:35.148 --> 17:36.554
Yeah. I know. I mean he hasn't done it yet,

17:36.555 --> 17:38.710
you know so maybe he'll back out,

17:38.711 --> 17:40.293
but he definitely asked.

17:40.294 --> 17:41.522
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:42.144 --> 17:42.941
She’s so young.

17:42.942 --> 17:43.458
I know.

17:43.459 --> 17:44.678
So what did you say?

17:44.679 --> 17:46.692
I told him he could ask her.

17:46.693 --> 17:47.812
Right. Yeah.

17:47.813 --> 17:48.727
What do you think?

17:48.728 --> 17:50.546
I'm just letting it sink in.

17:51.505 --> 17:54.261
You know, you hear about people asking the father.

17:54.262 --> 17:55.804
Not that you don't deserve to be asked

17:55.805 --> 17:58.443
you do. It’s just more stuff I've missed.

17:58.444 --> 18:02.830
We're gonna figure out this whole divorced-parenting thing eventually.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.214
She might be 60.

18:04.215 --> 18:07.282
Well, 60-year-olds are notoriously needy.

18:07.283 --> 18:08.730
At least we'll be in sync by then.

18:10.478 --> 18:11.639
You want to come see her?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.455
- Let’s do it.
- Okay.

18:14.991 --> 18:16.551
Hey, kiddo!

18:16.552 --> 18:17.560
Hi, dad.

18:17.561 --> 18:18.194
Hey.

18:19.419 --> 18:20.510
Hey it’s good to see you.

18:20.511 --> 18:21.895
Good to see you, too, sir.

18:21.896 --> 18:22.900
So, are you getting excited?

18:22.901 --> 18:24.598
Yeah, I can't believe it’s tomorrow.

18:24.599 --> 18:26.241
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,

18:26.242 --> 18:28.141
first let me thank you for coming

18:28.142 --> 18:31.188
to celebrate my granddaughter’s graduation.

18:31.189 --> 18:33.320
Ouch! I do beg your pardon.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.760
Celebrating our granddaughter’s graduation.

18:35.761 --> 18:37.290
I can't let him take all the credit.

18:37.291 --> 18:38.827
Have you seen her? Can you blame me?

18:40.012 --> 18:42.299
So, when my wife and I sat down to write our toast,

18:42.300 --> 18:44.053
we ran into something of a problem.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.434
All of our words sounded too mundane,

18:46.435 --> 18:49.689
too insignificant to mark such an auspicious occasion

18:49.690 --> 18:52.314
as Rory’s graduation from Yale.

18:52.315 --> 18:54.238
So instead...

18:54.239 --> 18:55.610
maestro...

18:55.611 --> 18:57.801
Please excuse us. We're not singers.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.563
Never let them see you sweat, dear.

19:03.821 --> 19:04.994
You're the top

19:06.669 --> 19:09.027
you have graduated.

19:09.411 --> 19:10.947
You're the top

19:11.827 --> 19:14.091
your grandparents are elated.

19:14.092 --> 19:18.144
Newspaper editor. Phi Beta Kappa wow!

19:18.145 --> 19:21.003
You're a revelation. A huge sensation.

19:21.004 --> 19:23.428
You should take a bow.

19:24.977 --> 19:26.642
You are done.

19:27.812 --> 19:29.830
No more school for you.

19:30.786 --> 19:32.323
There is nothing.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.487
Now that you can't do.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.378
You'll make us proud, we'll sing it loud.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.807
It’s true!

19:40.808 --> 19:45.285
'Cause now, Rory you're a Bulldog through and through.

19:48.094 --> 19:49.229
Yeah!

19:49.230 --> 19:50.073
Please stop.

19:50.977 --> 19:52.287
Oh, thank you, thank you.

19:52.288 --> 19:54.141
Wow. Thank you for that.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.202
We meant every word of that song.

19:56.203 --> 19:58.572
We certainly did, even the ones we sang off-key.

19:59.147 --> 20:00.543
We are so proud of you.

20:00.544 --> 20:01.909
Oh thank you so much.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.699
You know that none of this would
be possible without your help so.

20:04.751 --> 20:06.094
You should all know that

20:06.143 --> 20:08.492
there’s no way I could be a Bulldog

20:08.591 --> 20:10.289
through and through if
it weren't for these two,

20:10.290 --> 20:13.126
so thank you so much,
grandma and grandpa.

20:13.165 --> 20:14.705
Congratulations, Rory.

20:15.491 --> 20:16.187
To you.

20:16.459 --> 20:17.159
Cheers.

20:19.380 --> 20:23.398
Oh, it’s the babysitter, checking to see
if Gigi Can watch an hour of television.

20:23.490 --> 20:26.116
I don't think she’s ready for "The
Pussycat Dolls." I'll be right back.

20:26.205 --> 20:27.478
Actually, would you mind waiting?

20:27.755 --> 20:28.199
Sure.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.869
trust me you'll want to
stick around for this.

20:29.939 --> 20:30.422
Okay

20:31.217 --> 20:32.253
Is he gonna...

20:32.717 --> 20:34.425
Not here. Not now.

20:35.017 --> 20:38.985
If I could, I'd also like to say a few words
about my girlfriend of the past three years.

20:40.826 --> 20:43.719
You amaze me, Rory
Gilmore, every day --

20:43.768 --> 20:46.028
everything that you do,
everything that you are.

20:47.021 --> 20:50.466
This past year, I realized that I don't
know a lot more than I thought I knew,

20:51.328 --> 20:54.516
if that makes sense. I'm a little bit
nervous. I didn't think I would be.

20:55.049 --> 20:57.310
What I'm trying to say is that...

20:58.685 --> 20:59.652
I don't know a lot.

21:01.271 --> 21:02.495
But I know that I love you...

21:03.899 --> 21:05.153
and I want to be with you...

21:06.183 --> 21:06.884
forever.

21:14.234 --> 21:15.596
Rory Gilmore..

21:21.327 --> 21:22.788
will you marry me?

21:30.068 --> 21:31.114
Wow.

21:31.884 --> 21:36.227
Um, wow.
I -- wow.

21:36.717 --> 21:38.641
Is there a "yes" in
between those "wows"?

21:40.154 --> 21:41.457
Um, I'm just… I'm so...

21:42.119 --> 21:43.738
surprised.
I-I just --

21:48.045 --> 21:49.891
would -- um... w-will you
come talk to me outside?

21:50.241 --> 21:51.444
Sure.

21:55.207 --> 21:56.105
Play something
-- now.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.565
Sorry. I-I didn't want to

22:08.614 --> 22:09.562
talk in front of everybody.

22:09.690 --> 22:10.874
No. I completely understand.

22:11.072 --> 22:11.585
Is that…

22:11.674 --> 22:12.479
For us? Yeah.

22:12.942 --> 22:15.282
I’m sorry I know you said
you were over big gestures

22:15.302 --> 22:16.970
but that’s what wedding proposals are

22:16.971 --> 22:18.737
And night with your parents here and
your grandparents, I just thought...

22:19.122 --> 22:21.125
No, it’s not the size of the gesture.

22:21.208 --> 22:22.037
It’s the gesture itself.

22:22.077 --> 22:24.456
Rory, I got the job
out in silicon valley.

22:24.568 --> 22:26.404
What? You did? When?!

22:26.453 --> 22:29.069
They offered me the position
about 45 minutes after the meeting,

22:29.079 --> 22:31.823
but I wanted to save the
news until after I proposed.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.405
Wow. You've been thinking
about this for a while.

22:34.474 --> 22:37.298
Yeah. Back when everything was
up in the air business-wise,

22:37.299 --> 22:39.599
I realized as long as
I had you, I'd be okay.

22:41.183 --> 22:43.306
You would love Palo Alto, Rory.

22:43.345 --> 22:47.639
We could go hiking in the Dish on
weekends, biking at the Baylands.

22:47.692 --> 22:49.824
Wow. California sounds really athletic.

22:49.943 --> 22:52.114
Or coffee drinking on university avenue.

22:52.217 --> 22:53.826
That’s much easier to imagine.

22:53.836 --> 22:55.000
I went exploring a little,

22:55.287 --> 22:57.350
and there is this house
that we could rent.

22:57.353 --> 22:59.653
It has a backyard with an avocado tree.

22:59.732 --> 23:00.798
I do like guacamole.

23:00.799 --> 23:02.753
And it’s only 35 miles
south of San Francisco --

23:02.774 --> 23:04.289
just a straight shot up the 101.

23:04.358 --> 23:05.642
Wow you've done a lot of research.

23:05.681 --> 23:08.317
Yeah you could work at the Chronicle,
The San Francisco Bay Guardian.

23:08.662 --> 23:13.145
Wow. Oh, it sounds amazing. Logan,

23:13.194 --> 23:15.227
Logan, it sounds
wonderful. I just --

23:15.267 --> 23:16.491
I don't know. I mean,

23:16.685 --> 23:21.502
you've had time to think about
this and research. It’s so sweet

23:21.782 --> 23:22.927
and wonderful.
I just --

23:23.065 --> 23:25.128
I'm hearing about it for the first time.

23:25.151 --> 23:27.490
So you’re saying in the past three years,
you never thought about marrying me?

23:27.539 --> 23:28.497
No, of course I have.

23:28.517 --> 23:29.099
And?

23:29.198 --> 23:31.616
And it’s always a
really wonderful thought,

23:31.673 --> 23:33.361
but it was always hypothetical and…

23:33.400 --> 23:37.102
I know. For me, too. But
then it hit me -- why wait?

23:37.428 --> 23:41.070
Remember when we were in the life and death
brigade and we stood on top of that tower,

23:41.113 --> 23:43.522
and we held hands and we jumped?

23:44.015 --> 23:46.128
Let’s do that again, Rory. Let’s jump.

23:51.389 --> 23:52.534
Well I don’t what to do,

23:52.574 --> 23:54.161
should I continue to
stagger the hors d'oeuvres

23:54.440 --> 23:55.958
or just tell the kitchen
to send everything out?

23:55.993 --> 23:56.344
I don't know.

23:56.423 --> 23:57.934
What didn't she just say "yes"?

23:58.174 --> 24:00.050
I think she’s not sure she
wants to marry him, mom.

24:00.217 --> 24:01.659
That’s ridiculous. He’s a Huntzberger.

24:01.698 --> 24:03.425
An offer like this doesn't
come around every day.

24:03.495 --> 24:05.479
It’s a marriage proposal,
not a sale on linens.

24:05.929 --> 24:07.854
Clearly, Rory was caught off guard.

24:07.903 --> 24:08.861
All of us were.

24:09.098 --> 24:11.575
I'm sure she just needs a
moment to get her bearings.

24:11.674 --> 24:12.306
Hi, hon.

24:12.632 --> 24:14.162
Is that Rory? Did she say yes?

24:14.591 --> 24:16.694
Hey, it’s Rory. Do you want to come?

24:16.695 --> 24:17.483
No. You go.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.816
Okay. Hi.

24:22.178 --> 24:24.318
I just couldn't answer him.
You know I just kept saying,

24:24.559 --> 24:26.503
"I don't know. I'll have to think about it."
It was awful.

24:26.850 --> 24:29.554
He was obviously disappointed
and upset. You know

24:29.732 --> 24:32.980
he made all these plans about
the house we would live in

24:33.141 --> 24:34.810
and the avocado tree in our backyard

24:34.879 --> 24:36.280
Well, you do like guacamole.

24:37.005 --> 24:39.936
just had to explain to him
how out of the blue this is.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.595
I mean this is seriously out of the blue

24:41.596 --> 24:43.692
out of the deepest,
darkest, naviest blue.

24:43.722 --> 24:45.232
And why are you so calm, by the way?

24:45.370 --> 24:49.003
Oh, well, he asked my
permission a couple days ago.

24:49.004 --> 24:50.039
What? You knew?

24:50.040 --> 24:51.486
I was dying to tell you.

24:51.487 --> 24:53.252
Oh man you are a good secret keeper.

24:53.253 --> 24:55.059
Not really. I told
Sookie. I told your dad.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.727
Paul Anka and I discussed it at length.

24:56.808 --> 24:57.963
So what do you think I should do?

24:57.964 --> 25:00.392
Oh, honey, I think it’s your decision.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.742
I know, but tell me what
you think I should do.

25:02.856 --> 25:05.146
Well, I think you should take a few days

25:05.147 --> 25:06.636
you know, let the shock wear off.

25:07.189 --> 25:09.183
You're really not gonna
give me your opinion?

25:09.236 --> 25:10.510
Only you know what you want.

25:10.796 --> 25:11.556
Yeah.

25:12.359 --> 25:15.636
I love him. I do. I mean,

25:15.774 --> 25:17.285
things have been really amazing lately.

25:17.286 --> 25:18.984
But, on the other hand, we are so young.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.103
I'm only 22.

25:20.172 --> 25:22.610
On the other hand, what does
age matter when you're in love?

25:22.650 --> 25:23.972
On the other hand, what is the rush?

25:23.992 --> 25:26.016
Well, you're like a circus
freak with all the hands.

25:26.189 --> 25:28.143
Won't you just tell me what to do?

25:28.696 --> 25:29.890
Honey, I'm sorry.

25:30.048 --> 25:31.618
Oh! Okay

25:31.708 --> 25:32.823
You don't have to say anything.

25:33.139 --> 25:35.024
Just blink one eye if
you think I should do it.

25:35.293 --> 25:36.014
No.

25:36.340 --> 25:36.971
'Cause you don't?

25:37.129 --> 25:38.363
'Cause I won't.

25:39.582 --> 25:42.692
This is like the bird-versus-turtle
Halloween costume all over again.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.081
Well I didn't crack then,
and I'm not gonna crack now.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.625
I just think you need to figure it out.

25:46.635 --> 25:47.514
And
remember --

25:47.563 --> 25:50.584
that flying turtle bird was the most
original costume in the third grade.

25:50.613 --> 25:51.334
Yeah.

25:52.868 --> 25:55.572
But this time I have to
choose -- turtle or bird?

25:55.859 --> 25:57.339
Well, you're not in third grade anymore.

25:57.477 --> 25:58.297
Yeah, I guess not.

26:00.751 --> 26:03.239
Hey, how many hours do
we have the carriage for?

26:03.258 --> 26:05.252
Um, a couple more, I'm guessing.

26:06.223 --> 26:08.247
Want to drive through the center
of town and do the queen wave?

26:08.513 --> 26:09.327
Yes.

26:33.080 --> 26:33.702
How’s it going?

26:33.939 --> 26:34.334
Hey.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.656
What are you doing out here so late?

26:35.808 --> 26:38.177
I needed to take a walk to clear my head

26:38.178 --> 26:40.339
and I wanted to see if
Kirk was still in the box.

26:40.423 --> 26:42.723
Yeah apparently he is you know

26:42.841 --> 26:45.082
I wouldn't know. I've
decided to ignore him.

26:45.329 --> 26:48.438
Gawking only encourages
his asinine behavior.

26:49.677 --> 26:51.562
What about you? You're
usually long gone by now.

26:52.046 --> 26:54.356
The softball team’s
celebrating their first win.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.511
I couldn't get them out the door.
Clearing your head about what?

26:58.120 --> 26:59.858
Logan proposed to Rory.

27:00.455 --> 27:02.676
No way. Wow. Wow.

27:02.785 --> 27:05.302
I guess you would need a walk
for that. What did she say?

27:05.513 --> 27:07.823
Well, she said she needed
time to mull it over.

27:07.842 --> 27:08.336
Good answer.

27:08.681 --> 27:09.698
I thought so.

27:09.757 --> 27:11.682
So, did she ask for your advice?

27:11.822 --> 27:12.749
She did. Yeah.

27:12.789 --> 27:13.184
And?

27:13.494 --> 27:14.757
I told her it was her decision.

27:14.826 --> 27:16.129
My mother’s picking out china patterns.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.728
Oh, I bet she’s all over that.

27:17.768 --> 27:19.002
So, you're leaning toward "no"?

27:19.210 --> 27:22.865
Oh, uh, no. I'm not really
leaning. I'm kind of upright.

27:22.917 --> 27:26.352
Oh well I just, I could
understand if you were

27:26.539 --> 27:27.793
leaning away from "yes."

27:27.961 --> 27:28.336
Why?

27:28.448 --> 27:32.397
Well I mean she’s really young and
it’s the most important decision

27:32.466 --> 27:34.341
of your life --
you know, her life.

27:34.769 --> 27:37.237
Well, they love each
other. He’s been great.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.393
Maybe they got it together
young. Some people do.

27:39.432 --> 27:40.508
Right and others need time.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.009
Sure. Or they're never ready.

27:42.018 --> 27:43.608
I wouldn't say "never." Just

27:44.291 --> 27:47.588
they want to be a little more careful.
They're a little slower, you know

27:47.648 --> 27:48.546
just to make sure it’s right.

27:48.651 --> 27:50.694
Well you can't always
be 100% sure it’s right.

27:50.695 --> 27:52.254
Sometimes you just have
to take a leap of faith.

27:52.402 --> 27:54.030
You got to know what
you're leaping into.

27:54.112 --> 27:56.165
After all this time,
how could you not know?

27:56.284 --> 27:57.409
How could who not know?

27:57.666 --> 27:58.031
Rory.

27:58.189 --> 27:58.662
Right.

27:59.038 --> 27:59.413
Right.

27:59.561 --> 27:59.896
Rory.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.508
Well, that was my walk,
and, uh, I'm gonna head home.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.268
Good enough

28:06.380 --> 28:08.621
Oh, I almost forgot something. Hang on.

28:13.017 --> 28:14.251
Are you allowed to talk in there?

28:14.488 --> 28:16.759
Rules are a little gray on that!

28:33.741 --> 28:34.807
I got this for Rory.

28:35.241 --> 28:35.784
Oh.

28:36.233 --> 28:40.182
Yeah. I just thought it would be better if
she got it on the day of her actual graduation.

28:40.507 --> 28:42.531
Oh, that’s -- that’s
-- that’s nice.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.182
Yeah, so...

28:44.538 --> 28:45.032
Thoughtful.

28:47.233 --> 28:48.428
So, good night.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.565
Good night.

28:53.025 --> 28:53.775
Good night, Kirk.

28:54.348 --> 28:55.157
Good night.

30:23.711 --> 30:25.782
I'm just saying he’s a superb writer.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.811
I'm just saying that a superb writer

30:27.812 --> 30:30.379
does not a superb speaker make. I could barely stay awake.

30:30.380 --> 30:33.051
I told you to start with coffee. It’s a two-ceremony day.

30:33.052 --> 30:34.353
Maybe it’s just a cultural thing.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.198
Maybe Milan Kundera is the Robin Williams of the Czech republic.

30:37.199 --> 30:38.969
With that voice? So soporific it was

30:38.970 --> 30:41.230
as if he were trying to perform a mass hypnosis.

30:41.231 --> 30:42.681
We should hurry up if we want to get

30:42.682 --> 30:44.907
good seats to watch Rory get her diploma.

30:44.908 --> 30:47.523
My point is, with all the potential speakers out there,

30:47.524 --> 30:49.118
why choose someone so dull?

30:49.119 --> 30:51.693
You know for a while, Rory said they were considering Henry Winkler.

30:51.694 --> 30:52.429
That would have been neat.

30:52.430 --> 30:52.898
Who?

30:52.899 --> 30:53.954
You mean Henry Kissinger?

30:53.955 --> 30:55.479
Not unless he played the Fonz.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.341
I'm assuming that Logan will join us

30:57.342 --> 30:58.714
for the actual commencement at Branford.

30:58.715 --> 30:59.945
- Nope.
- No?

30:59.946 --> 31:01.165
He’s sitting with his friends.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.482
Plus, I think it would be awkward, you know?

31:03.483 --> 31:05.418
I don't know. No one knows. Only Rory.

31:05.419 --> 31:06.379
Well, mom...

31:06.380 --> 31:08.863
Well I just can't believe you don't have more information.

31:08.864 --> 31:11.139
She said she’s thinking about it so she’s thinking.

31:11.140 --> 31:11.972
What is she thinking?

31:11.973 --> 31:13.379
- I don't know.
- Why not?

31:13.380 --> 31:15.461
Actually, Kissinger would be duller than Kundera

31:15.462 --> 31:17.397
with that foghorn voice and that accent.

31:17.398 --> 31:19.391
Of the two, I'd vote for the Fonz.

31:19.392 --> 31:20.769
Do you even know who the Fonz is?

31:20.770 --> 31:22.294
Oh, wait, wait. Oh, shoot.

31:22.295 --> 31:22.939
What’s wrong?

31:22.940 --> 31:24.766
I promised Patty and Babette

31:24.767 --> 31:27.335
that I would get lots of extra programs for the re-enactment.

31:27.336 --> 31:28.294
Oh here. You can have mine.

31:29.174 --> 31:31.098
What? It was hot. I needed a fan.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.863
Sweetheart, I'm sure I can use some of my many contacts

31:33.864 --> 31:36.074
to procure as many programs as you need.

31:36.075 --> 31:37.975
Really? Could you? That would be great.

31:37.976 --> 31:39.649
Can I have my program back, then?

31:39.978 --> 31:42.934
As my friend Sylvia Rosenblat is saying, I'm "Shavitzing."

31:42.935 --> 31:47.728
Shvitzing, mom. Shvitzing. Never mind.

31:47.734 --> 31:50.359
So, seriously, 90% of the class

31:50.360 --> 31:51.286
- was at this party…
- More!

31:51.287 --> 31:53.080
And everyone’s watching.

31:53.081 --> 31:55.978
He starts to -- swear to god -- do the robot.

31:55.979 --> 31:57.277
- Professor Watley?
- Uh-huh.

31:57.278 --> 31:58.916
Wait isn't he like 150?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.599
I know, right. At first, we thought he was having a seizure,

32:01.600 --> 32:03.793
which you know would have been easier to take.

32:03.794 --> 32:06.711
That was so funny, an awesome party, by the way.

32:06.712 --> 32:09.010
I thought you were gonna come after your grandparents' little cocktail bash.

32:09.649 --> 32:11.901
Yeah, Gilmore, you're so lame for blowing it off.

32:11.902 --> 32:13.831
Yeah at least I had an excuse.

32:13.832 --> 32:16.928
My boyfriend and I went to “Star of Bombay” as a little warm-up for our trip to India.

32:16.929 --> 32:19.846
It turns out Doyle’s stomach and Vindaloo are not bunk buddies.

32:19.847 --> 32:21.297
It’s gonna be a long trip.

32:21.298 --> 32:23.983
Well I would have gone to that party if somebody hadn't insisted

32:23.984 --> 32:27.057
that I finish spackling all the holes in our apartment, upon pain of death.

32:27.058 --> 32:30.347
Hey, each unspackled hole is deposit money that our hygienically challenged,

32:30.348 --> 32:33.731
sleazebag of a landlord will use to supply his freaking porn habit.

32:34.025 --> 32:35.467
College has mellowed Paris.

32:35.468 --> 32:37.598
How was your grandparents' cocktail party?

32:37.599 --> 32:39.429
Were there great huzzahs in your honor?

32:39.430 --> 32:41.142
Oh it was fine.

32:41.143 --> 32:43.893
People walked around, had grown-up drinks, and

32:43.894 --> 32:46.375
my grandparents sang me a song. I turned a deep shade of red.

32:46.376 --> 32:47.526
It was fine.

32:47.527 --> 32:49.332
Uh-oh it looks like you guys are lining up.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.139
We better get over to Saybrook.

32:51.379 --> 32:52.658
To our future!

32:52.659 --> 32:54.274
Huzzah!

32:54.275 --> 32:57.406
I wonder if I'll actually get my diploma in my envelope.

32:57.407 --> 32:58.986
Why? Do you have some overdue library books?

32:58.987 --> 33:00.860
And she has no idea where they are.

33:00.861 --> 33:02.441
Please forward my mail to Argentina.

33:02.442 --> 33:05.268
I'll be hiding out until the heat blows over. I love you guys!

33:05.269 --> 33:06.907
- Bye!
- Bye!

33:06.908 --> 33:08.441
Did she try on the ring?

33:08.442 --> 33:09.473
I have no idea.

33:09.474 --> 33:11.397
I can't believe you have no idea what she’s going to do.

33:11.398 --> 33:13.239
I mean aren’t you two “bosom buddies”

33:13.240 --> 33:15.849
Isn't the sharing of intimate information your thing?

33:15.850 --> 33:18.813
Mom our thing right now is letting Rory make her own decisions.

33:18.814 --> 33:20.010
What did you tell her to do?

33:20.011 --> 33:22.529
Mom I didn't tell her to do anything.

33:22.530 --> 33:23.948
I'm letting her make her own decision.

33:23.949 --> 33:25.016
But you must have at least…

33:25.017 --> 33:26.822
Emily can we focus on the ceremony?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.913
So, are these seats okay? Can you both see the stage?

33:29.914 --> 33:30.816
Perfectly.

33:30.817 --> 33:32.329
Well, I'm sure someone will take a photo

33:32.330 --> 33:34.884
of Rory receiving her diploma close-up.

33:34.885 --> 33:37.306
Mom, if you don't like these seats, we can go look for others.

33:37.307 --> 33:38.526
No. Then we'll lose these.

33:38.527 --> 33:41.077
Well we can have dad wait here while I try to find better seats…

33:41.078 --> 33:42.520
Lorelai, these seats are fine.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.104
Hey!

33:43.105 --> 33:44.758
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

33:44.759 --> 33:45.720
You're not late.

33:46.165 --> 33:48.476
The ceremony is starting late, of course,

33:48.477 --> 33:50.870
after Lorelai drove us like cattle to get here.

33:51.421 --> 33:53.459
You be the deciding vote. Are these seats okay,

33:53.460 --> 33:55.148
or do you think we should look for better ones?

33:55.149 --> 33:56.245
These seem great.

33:56.679 --> 33:59.050
Really? Because that lady has long hair,

33:59.051 --> 34:00.223
and if a breeze blows up, it might…

34:00.224 --> 34:01.827
Lorelai, Lorelai, the seats are perfect.

34:01.828 --> 34:02.660
All righty.

34:02.661 --> 34:04.358
- Any answer from Rory?
- Not yet.

34:04.359 --> 34:06.258
Apparently Lorelai has decided to invoke

34:06.259 --> 34:07.572
the "don't ask, don't tell" rule.

34:07.573 --> 34:08.428
Oh mom.

34:08.429 --> 34:10.971
Bill Clinton -- that’s a speaker I would have enjoyed.

34:10.972 --> 34:14.780
I can't stand his politics, but he has a commanding presence and a nice voice.

34:14.781 --> 34:17.147
I wonder if he records books on tape.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.194
So have you thought about what you're going to say?

34:20.195 --> 34:20.722
What?

34:20.723 --> 34:22.114
When he hands you the diploma.

34:22.114 --> 34:24.929
I can't decide between "thank you" and "thank you so much."

34:24.931 --> 34:25.572
Oh.

34:25.572 --> 34:27.795
It’s a significant moment, and I want to do it right.

34:27.795 --> 34:30.000
If I say just plain "thank you," it sounds kind of casual,

34:30.001 --> 34:31.713
ike he’s handing me a slice of pizza.

34:31.714 --> 34:33.235
But "thank you so much" sounds weird,

34:33.235 --> 34:35.650
like I'm acknowledging applause after singing a love ballad.

34:35.652 --> 34:38.936
I think I'm just gonna do a polite smile and a "thank you."

34:39.525 --> 34:42.094
- Okay. This is it.
- Yeah.

34:42.094 --> 34:44.170
We've been drafting off each other since high school,

34:44.170 --> 34:46.047
and now it’s each woman for herself.

34:46.047 --> 34:47.815
Who knows when we'll see each other again, right?

34:47.815 --> 34:49.815
Paris I haven't been able to shake you off all these years.

34:49.815 --> 34:52.114
We're gonna be friends for a very long time.

34:52.114 --> 34:54.949
You're gonna do such great things with your life, Rory.

34:54.951 --> 34:58.384
Oh! Wow. Okay.

34:58.385 --> 35:00.974
Okay, g’s, you're on the move!

35:03.680 --> 35:05.006
Unto the breach.

35:13.208 --> 35:15.496
Phoebe Elizabeth Gabner.

35:19.771 --> 35:21.554
You ready to be parents of a Yale graduate?

35:21.555 --> 35:23.651
I already got the bumper sticker picked out.

35:23.652 --> 35:25.446
Just so you know, I read in the New York Times

35:25.447 --> 35:27.683
that people are getting married younger and younger these days.

35:27.684 --> 35:29.792
Well the good news is, if it was in the New York Times,

35:29.793 --> 35:31.669
Rory saw it and filed it away. What’s wrong?

35:31.670 --> 35:33.789
This chair is faulty. Every time I lean

35:33.790 --> 35:36.663
from one side to the other, I almost slide off.

35:36.664 --> 35:37.924
Do you want to switch seats?

35:37.925 --> 35:39.578
Now Lorelai, you don't need to switch.

35:39.579 --> 35:41.886
Emily, your chair’s fine. Just don't lean.

35:41.887 --> 35:44.502
I have to lean. This woman keeps rocking back and forth.

35:44.503 --> 35:46.396
It’s like sitting behind Ray Charles.

35:46.397 --> 35:48.249
Paris Eustace Geller.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.912
Oh, Paris!

35:50.170 --> 35:52.387
I'm just saying you have pull. Use it.

35:52.388 --> 35:53.534
That’s what parenting is.

35:53.535 --> 35:54.719
Don’t know if her family is here,

35:54.720 --> 35:55.534
I'm gonna take a picture for Rory.

35:55.535 --> 35:56.707
She looks up to you,

35:56.708 --> 35:59.428
and when a child looks up to you and has a difficult decision to make,

35:59.429 --> 36:00.566
you tell her what to do.

36:00.567 --> 36:02.091
That’s not how I do it.

36:02.092 --> 36:03.223
So you're just content…

36:03.224 --> 36:05.675
Emily, please. Rory is next.

36:05.676 --> 36:06.892
Roberta Gelson.

36:06.893 --> 36:08.264
Honey, tell me what time it is.

36:08.265 --> 36:09.836
I told everyone I'd notice the exact time

36:09.837 --> 36:11.883
so that when we do the re-enactment they would have the…

36:11.884 --> 36:14.897
Lorelai, I will note the time. I will take the photo.

36:14.898 --> 36:18.249
You just sit there and enjoy your daughter’s graduation from Yale.

36:18.250 --> 36:20.757
This is as much your moment as Rory’s.

36:20.758 --> 36:22.329
Enjoy it.

36:22.724 --> 36:24.848
Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.830
Yay, Rory!

36:48.073 --> 36:50.754
All right, everyone. Say "Fromage."

36:50.755 --> 36:51.352
Dad.

36:51.353 --> 36:52.267
Must you always do that?

36:52.268 --> 36:54.109
Entertain them with that in the Great War?

36:54.110 --> 36:55.748
- Got it.
-  Excellent.

36:55.749 --> 36:57.648
All right what other combinations haven't we done?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.314
Um, duh. Me, mom, and dad.

36:59.315 --> 37:01.009
"Duh"? That’s our Yale graduate.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.276
She meant “Doy”.

37:02.277 --> 37:03.927
All right. Everybody,

37:03.928 --> 37:05.179
everybody say...

37:05.180 --> 37:07.302
- Don't!
- ...Whatever you like.

37:07.642 --> 37:08.440
Got it.

37:08.441 --> 37:11.170
Good, make sure you save it. You erased the last one.

37:11.171 --> 37:12.484
I don't trust these things.

37:12.485 --> 37:13.522
I'll be right back.

37:14.437 --> 37:17.182
Oh, Richard, Emily, can I get one with you guys?

37:17.927 --> 37:19.933
Thank you. Good to see you.

37:20.378 --> 37:22.361
Hey. Congratulations.

37:22.362 --> 37:23.006
Thanks.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.598
Yeah you did great -- no tripping, no dropping the diploma.

37:25.599 --> 37:27.308
No, nothing like that.

37:27.309 --> 37:29.921
I remember when I graduated. I was a little tipsy

37:29.922 --> 37:31.854
that’s a big surprise, huh? -- And I did trip,

37:31.855 --> 37:34.842
and I reached out and grabbed the robe of Marcia Hadley,

37:34.843 --> 37:36.481
who was so not the person to grab.

37:36.482 --> 37:37.595
Logan…

37:39.296 --> 37:40.610
I'm sorry…

37:41.613 --> 37:42.669
I can't.

37:44.264 --> 37:44.933
I love you.

37:45.739 --> 37:47.686
You know how much I love you.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.249
I love the idea of being married to you...

37:53.554 --> 37:56.358
but... there are just

37:56.359 --> 37:59.273
a lot of things right now in my life that are undecided.

38:00.094 --> 38:02.593
And that used to scare me,

38:02.594 --> 38:04.947
but now I-I kind of like the idea that..

38:04.948 --> 38:06.868
it’s just all kind of...

38:06.869 --> 38:08.522
wide open.

38:08.523 --> 38:10.991
And if I married you, it just wouldn't be.

38:11.836 --> 38:14.241
So, what? I go to San Francisco, you stay on the east,

38:14.242 --> 38:16.302
and we see each other occasionally?

38:16.303 --> 38:18.050
Well, we can try long distance.

38:18.692 --> 38:20.170
We've done it before.

38:20.171 --> 38:21.672
You really think that’s gonna work?

38:21.673 --> 38:23.584
I think it would be hard, but...

38:24.024 --> 38:27.097
I don't want to do that, Rory. I don't want to go backwards.

38:27.098 --> 38:29.015
If we can't take the next step...

38:29.930 --> 38:30.505
What?

38:31.068 --> 38:32.205
I mean...

38:33.962 --> 38:35.780
Does it have to be all or nothing?

38:36.868 --> 38:38.358
Yeah, it does.

38:41.088 --> 38:43.469
But we could at least try.

38:46.522 --> 38:47.578
What’s the point?

38:51.167 --> 38:52.469
So...

38:53.766 --> 38:54.845
So...

39:15.464 --> 39:16.789
goodbye, Rory.

39:28.693 --> 39:30.147
Okay. Just one more trip.

39:30.757 --> 39:32.945
No! I can't.

39:32.946 --> 39:35.643
This is why we don't exercise. It’s too exhausting.

39:35.644 --> 39:37.657
Well it wouldn't be so exhausting if we exercised.

39:37.658 --> 39:40.801
Oh, darn your college-graduate logic.

39:42.077 --> 39:43.003
How you doing, honey?

39:43.004 --> 39:44.619
Uh, okay.

39:44.620 --> 39:46.508
Yeah?

39:46.915 --> 39:48.616
Well, I'm not okay.

39:48.617 --> 39:51.373
I feel awful. I feel sick.

39:51.374 --> 39:53.091
I miss him already.

39:53.092 --> 39:53.725
I know.

39:53.726 --> 39:55.496
And it just sucks, you know, because

39:55.497 --> 39:56.915
I graduated today.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.317
This was supposed to be a happy day in my life, and

39:59.318 --> 40:00.367
now when I look back on it,

40:00.368 --> 40:03.015
I'm just gonna think about this horrible thing that happened.

40:03.649 --> 40:04.857
I'm sorry.

40:05.549 --> 40:07.270
I think you made the right decision.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.687
- You do?
- I do.

40:09.688 --> 40:11.540
Someday you'll meet someone,

40:11.541 --> 40:14.135
and you'll just know it’s right.

40:14.136 --> 40:16.493
You won't want to hesitate. You'll just know.

40:16.494 --> 40:18.042
I hope so.

40:18.043 --> 40:19.434
I really do believe it.

40:21.522 --> 40:23.998
So I guess no avocado trees.

40:23.999 --> 40:26.203
Well, no avocado tree.

40:26.572 --> 40:28.543
You know, I think I'll get my own avocado tree.

40:28.544 --> 40:31.074
See? You could get your own cherry tree,

40:31.075 --> 40:33.097
get your own peanut tree,

40:33.098 --> 40:35.244
just have peanut butter all day long.

40:35.245 --> 40:37.226
Peanuts don't grown on trees. They grow under the ground.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.693
Whatever. My point is you can have anything you want.

40:41.664 --> 40:44.139
Oh, yes. It’s wide open.
