WEBVTT

01:12.200 --> 01:13.466
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:13.468 --> 01:15.503
Come on!
Come on, come on.

01:15.505 --> 01:17.706
Fuck! Move, move,
move! Get the door!

01:17.907 --> 01:19.709
Shit!

01:21.009 --> 01:22.544
Shut the fucking door!

01:53.675 --> 01:55.808
- Florek! Florek!
- I'm okay!

01:55.810 --> 01:57.543
- I'm okay!
- Gotta keep him awake.

01:57.545 --> 01:58.679
Get us out of here, Harry!

01:58.681 --> 02:00.113
You said this was handled!

02:00.115 --> 02:01.381
You said this was handled!

02:01.383 --> 02:03.316
Kick that fucking door off!

02:03.318 --> 02:04.519
Shit.

02:06.723 --> 02:07.723
Damn it!

02:08.056 --> 02:09.523
Come on, come on, come on!

02:09.525 --> 02:11.093
Shit!

02:11.359 --> 02:13.696
Fuck.

02:19.901 --> 02:22.101
I want my money.

02:22.103 --> 02:23.636
"I want my money."

02:23.638 --> 02:24.771
I thought it was our money.

02:24.773 --> 02:27.442
It's my store, Carlos.
My store.

02:28.075 --> 02:30.510
Every time I give you a loan,

02:30.512 --> 02:32.546
it's like an IOU,
but this is a new low.

02:32.548 --> 02:34.481
What, you accusing me
of stealing your money?

02:34.483 --> 02:35.614
Why do you look surprised?

02:35.616 --> 02:37.149
You do it for a living.

02:37.151 --> 02:38.485
Where you get the balls?

02:38.487 --> 02:40.654
What I do for this family.
I risk my life.

02:40.656 --> 02:42.221
Yeah. You risk your life

02:42.223 --> 02:43.959
and then you piss it up a wall.

02:44.592 --> 02:45.994
Mija, come here.

02:46.763 --> 02:47.763
I love you. Huh?

02:47.863 --> 02:50.032
Listen to your mother
even though she crazy. Huh?

02:50.299 --> 02:52.165
She's always crazy.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.799
Always crazy.

02:53.801 --> 02:54.971
Come here.

02:56.472 --> 02:58.339
- I love you.
- Always true.

02:58.341 --> 03:00.307
Always true.

03:00.309 --> 03:01.808
Just let me out!
Let me out!

03:01.810 --> 03:04.077
No way.
We're sticking to the plan.

03:14.090 --> 03:15.724
You should eat something.

03:19.228 --> 03:20.897
Does that hurt? That?

03:21.896 --> 03:23.031
Hmm?

03:23.698 --> 03:24.866
Boop.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.901
Boop, boop.

03:27.335 --> 03:28.868
You need to do
something with makeup.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.203
Makes me feel bad
to look at that.

03:30.205 --> 03:32.125
It makes me feel bad, too.

03:37.545 --> 03:38.747
Come here. I love you.

03:41.416 --> 03:42.682
Today with your

03:42.684 --> 03:44.083
forecast for the Windy City.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.652
Hi, I'm Christine Dawn.

03:45.654 --> 03:46.986
Winds are going
to continue to be

03:46.988 --> 03:48.721
out of the north
for most of Tuesday.

03:48.723 --> 03:51.857
At 28Â°, and that westerly
wind direction for your...

03:51.859 --> 03:52.860
Breakfast?

03:53.461 --> 03:55.697
Gotta run.

03:56.264 --> 03:57.464
Let's get in the other van.

03:57.466 --> 03:59.166
We'll fix him at home.
Let's go!

04:05.440 --> 04:06.873
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.644
Come on!

04:09.343 --> 04:10.743
That's it.

04:16.651 --> 04:17.918
What the fuck?

04:56.257 --> 04:59.825
Most people don't know
what an alderman does...

04:59.827 --> 05:02.596
including a fair number
of aldermen.

05:03.966 --> 05:07.369
It comes from the Old English,
meaning "older man."

05:08.002 --> 05:10.570
When I was a younger man,
Facebook...

05:10.572 --> 05:12.139
Back then, a face was something

05:12.141 --> 05:13.806
you tried never to forget.

05:13.808 --> 05:15.911
A book?

05:17.913 --> 05:20.914
A book was something you read
to your son. My son, Jack.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.649
Stand up, Jack. Stand up.

05:22.651 --> 05:23.685
My son.

05:24.286 --> 05:27.656
The best candidate for
alderman of the 18th ward.

05:28.757 --> 05:30.860
He's your man. Believe me.

05:50.545 --> 05:51.678
What, you can't speak?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.079
Yo, could I get a piece of that?

05:53.081 --> 05:54.515
Gotta get a loan, player.

05:54.517 --> 05:56.351
I got good credit.
What's up?

05:57.920 --> 05:59.288
Whatever.

06:05.127 --> 06:06.862
Mr. Mulligan.

06:07.428 --> 06:09.063
- Mr. Manning.
- Hmm.

06:09.065 --> 06:10.166
My aide, Siobhan.

06:10.432 --> 06:12.298
- This is my brother.
- Jatemme.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.301
I love you, too.

06:16.004 --> 06:18.404
As a kid, I used to help out
with my dad's campaign.

06:18.406 --> 06:19.772
It looked a lot like this.

06:19.774 --> 06:20.839
Except a little whiter,

06:20.841 --> 06:22.175
- I imagine.
- Yeah.

06:22.177 --> 06:23.444
- Mind?
- Please do.

06:23.911 --> 06:25.846
My father always thought
it was a good idea

06:25.848 --> 06:26.913
to keep the lines
of communication

06:26.915 --> 06:28.048
open with his opponent.

06:28.050 --> 06:30.750
Keep things honest, dignified.

06:30.752 --> 06:32.152
Maybe he could be
more honest and open

06:32.154 --> 06:33.919
about whatever deal he made
with the city council

06:33.921 --> 06:35.755
to call this special election
instead of waiting

06:35.757 --> 06:37.556
until February
like the law says.

06:37.558 --> 06:38.793
He had to step down.

06:39.226 --> 06:40.592
He had a heart attack.

06:40.594 --> 06:41.827
Who does waiting serve?

06:41.829 --> 06:43.729
Everyone who's
not named Mulligan.

06:43.731 --> 06:45.731
First time I've run for office.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.933
I'm already ahead of you
by 12 points in the polls.

06:47.935 --> 06:50.003
The Mulligans have run
the 18th ward for 60 years.

06:50.005 --> 06:51.171
My grandfather, my father.

06:51.173 --> 06:52.716
These days it's
all about name recognition.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.140
You wanna go against me?

06:54.142 --> 06:56.308
You don't inherit a ward, Jack.

06:56.310 --> 06:57.344
You run for it.

06:58.012 --> 06:59.532
You have much experience
in government?

06:59.880 --> 07:01.714
- I live here.
- So do I.

07:01.716 --> 07:02.916
No, no, no.

07:02.918 --> 07:06.786
You, uh, own a house one block
into the ward.

07:06.788 --> 07:09.289
A house people might actually
want to live in.

07:09.291 --> 07:10.490
It's a smart idea.

07:10.492 --> 07:12.093
Running headquarters
from a church.

07:12.827 --> 07:14.127
I mean, it's illegal.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.965
There's that whole
church and state thing.

07:16.298 --> 07:17.432
More illegal than nepotism?

07:17.632 --> 07:19.334
Nepotism isn't illegal.

07:19.601 --> 07:21.303
It's actually celebrated.
This is Chicago.

07:21.735 --> 07:23.437
Your daddy can put you
on some commission

07:23.439 --> 07:24.679
where people don't have no say.

07:24.774 --> 07:26.440
Let you be a big boy,
play with a few trains, but...

07:26.442 --> 07:28.140
Extending the Green Line
is the best thing

07:28.142 --> 07:29.976
for the people of the 18th ward.

07:29.978 --> 07:32.378
Brings them closer to jobs,
closer to culture.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.046
Those people
don't seem to be the ones

07:34.048 --> 07:35.615
getting rich though, Jack.

07:35.617 --> 07:36.849
What about you, Jamal?

07:36.851 --> 07:38.717
What have you been doing
to improve the lives

07:38.719 --> 07:39.920
of the people of Chicago?

07:40.154 --> 07:42.022
I bet your reputation's
a real problem

07:42.024 --> 07:43.184
for your communications team.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.493
Maybe you the one who need
the communications team.

07:45.894 --> 07:48.062
I've never been arrested.

07:48.363 --> 07:50.733
Let's see if you can say that
a few months from now.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.800
If you pull out now,
you can save yourself

07:53.802 --> 07:55.771
some money,
ton of embarrassment.

07:56.004 --> 07:57.637
Come on, Jack, I don't pull out

07:57.639 --> 07:58.738
when it feels this good.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.305
Right?

08:00.307 --> 08:02.341
All right. Don't forget
to vote on August 8th.

08:02.343 --> 08:05.445
Absolutely. Hey. the election
is on the 7th, Jack.

08:05.447 --> 08:06.448
Oh, I know.

08:14.221 --> 08:16.757
Why you wanna go
into politics anyway, man?

08:17.091 --> 08:20.125
Passing bills and shit.
Whatever the fuck they do.

08:20.127 --> 08:23.161
Alderman of this ward
makes a $104,000 a year.

08:23.163 --> 08:25.098
Shit, we make
more than that in a week.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.069
But then you add in
the juice, right?

08:27.469 --> 08:28.734
He gives his friend a contract

08:28.736 --> 08:30.437
for a new building,
gets a kickback.

08:30.439 --> 08:32.272
Gives his brother a contract
for construction.

08:32.274 --> 08:34.274
Hell, he give his mama
a contract for construction.

08:34.408 --> 08:37.779
That man owns a piece
of every fucking thing.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.645
The only people
coming after him,

08:39.648 --> 08:41.046
they got cameras
and microphones.

08:41.048 --> 08:42.717
People coming after us
with guns.

08:43.384 --> 08:46.221
I'm 37 years old, Jatemme.
I don't want this life no more.

08:47.322 --> 08:48.823
I want his fucking life.

08:49.991 --> 08:51.592
Harry Rawlings is dead.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.461
What that gotta do with us?

08:55.463 --> 08:56.896
Hey, what?

08:56.898 --> 08:58.367
He took our money with him.

09:08.076 --> 09:10.412
Medical examiner
say he can still ID them?

09:10.611 --> 09:12.447
I think off the teeth maybe?

09:13.682 --> 09:15.717
I always said
he should burn in hell.

09:16.051 --> 09:18.387
But, hey, Chicago'll do.

10:33.195 --> 10:35.528
He who admonishes
the young to live well

10:35.530 --> 10:38.364
and the old to make good end
speaks foolishly,

10:38.366 --> 10:41.166
not merely because of
the desirability of life,

10:41.168 --> 10:43.170
but because
the same exercise at once

10:43.172 --> 10:45.939
teaches us to live well
and to die well.

10:45.941 --> 10:47.740
Much worse is he who says

10:47.742 --> 10:49.943
that it were good
not to be born,

10:49.945 --> 10:53.045
but once one is born
to pass with all speed

10:53.047 --> 10:54.479
through the gates of Hades.

10:58.419 --> 11:01.253
He was so beautiful, wasn't he?

11:01.255 --> 11:04.824
His eyes. He got away with
so much because of those eyes.

11:04.826 --> 11:06.057
I know, I know.

11:06.059 --> 11:08.295
Because they
didn't let me see the body.

11:08.297 --> 11:10.499
I couldn't say goodbye
properly, Ma.

11:11.299 --> 11:12.699
I wanna see it.

11:12.701 --> 11:17.206
I promise you, Alitzia,
you don't wanna see his body.

11:18.505 --> 11:20.041
What's left of it.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.460
Would you like something to eat?

11:40.240 --> 11:41.940
Something to drink, then?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.160
I don't want anything from you.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.520
You're the reason I'm here...

11:48.800 --> 11:51.100
and Carlos isn't

11:56.520 --> 11:59.320
He got into the life on his own.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.280
He did if for you.

12:02.920 --> 12:07.520
Before you, he was going to college.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.320
His blood is on your hands.

12:24.172 --> 12:25.805
What do you think
of my new painting?

12:25.807 --> 12:26.873
What?

12:26.875 --> 12:28.940
The artist is really blowing up.

12:28.942 --> 12:31.676
I got in early,
got it for 50,000. Drink?

12:31.678 --> 12:32.680
Yeah.

12:34.048 --> 12:36.284
To the masterpiece.

12:39.354 --> 12:40.655
Yeah, so...

12:41.255 --> 12:43.225
Did you get him to concede?

12:43.692 --> 12:45.494
Go back to his normal business?

12:45.894 --> 12:47.395
Now, let me tell you something.

12:48.163 --> 12:50.632
I don't wanna see you
become the first Mulligan...

12:51.232 --> 12:52.233
to lose to a nigger.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.370
Especially this guy.
He's tricky.

12:54.836 --> 12:56.035
Okay?

12:56.037 --> 12:57.338
He's staying in.

12:57.639 --> 12:58.738
- But it's fine.
- Okay?

12:58.740 --> 13:00.375
Yeah. It's dealt with.

13:00.807 --> 13:02.075
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

13:02.077 --> 13:03.779
Dealt with? What do you mean,
"dealt with"?

13:04.011 --> 13:05.545
Maybe you shouldn't have been
such a hard-ass.

13:05.547 --> 13:06.746
Now, if you'd have
just rolled over

13:06.748 --> 13:08.359
for the mayor
on that housing development...

13:08.383 --> 13:10.652
I don't roll over for anybody!

13:11.318 --> 13:12.387
Okay?

13:13.255 --> 13:15.887
- He had his agenda, I had mine.
- Look where that's got us.

13:15.889 --> 13:17.169
The lines of the ward
are redrawn

13:17.259 --> 13:19.528
and we're down 7,000 votes
that would've gone our way.

13:21.163 --> 13:22.965
You created this problem.

13:23.599 --> 13:26.031
Now we might be left
without a pot to piss in.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.301
Oh, says the man
with the $50,000

13:28.303 --> 13:30.639
piece of wallpaper.

13:31.505 --> 13:32.640
It's art.

13:33.542 --> 13:34.710
It's wallpaper.

13:35.309 --> 13:36.310
Art.

13:37.044 --> 13:38.212
Wallpaper.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.124
Whole time caught the niggas
in the back rapping.

14:56.725 --> 14:58.527
They cold though, Ja.

15:00.928 --> 15:02.128
Hey, man, it wasn't our fault.

15:02.264 --> 15:03.829
They knew where we were
gonna be. That shit was a setup.

15:03.831 --> 15:05.430
They had to be professionals
or some shit.

15:05.432 --> 15:06.699
You let Harry Rawlings

15:06.701 --> 15:08.167
get away with our money.

15:08.169 --> 15:09.770
No, that's not what I'm...

15:17.711 --> 15:20.548
I wanna hear what you were
doing. Do it again.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.285
Hmm?

15:23.719 --> 15:25.521
Your music. Hmm?

15:28.456 --> 15:30.125
I'm not kidding. Do it again.

15:30.658 --> 15:32.461
All right, let's get it.

16:13.969 --> 16:15.237
Run.

16:19.408 --> 16:20.875
Take care of this.

16:37.926 --> 16:39.794
Is everything taken care of?

16:40.160 --> 16:42.763
Yes, ma'am,
I got the roses you wanted.

16:43.498 --> 16:46.033
They got three
different dove gray caskets.

16:46.601 --> 16:49.004
You'd be surprised how much
they want for those things.

16:50.272 --> 16:51.369
You wanna guess how much?

16:51.371 --> 16:53.641
No, no, I don't.
I just wanna go.

16:55.509 --> 16:57.209
Harry said if anything
happened to him,

16:57.211 --> 16:58.513
I should give this to you.

16:59.514 --> 17:00.581
When?

17:02.317 --> 17:03.619
Uh...

17:04.251 --> 17:05.921
Honestly, I don't remember.

17:07.021 --> 17:09.357
I don't remember
things too good.

17:12.794 --> 17:15.060
Then he will
see you face to face

17:15.063 --> 17:16.930
and in your light will see light

17:16.932 --> 17:19.231
and know the splendor of God.

17:19.233 --> 17:22.067
For you live and reign
forever and ever. Amen.

17:22.069 --> 17:23.271
Amen.

17:57.305 --> 17:58.774
Harry Rawlings.

17:59.641 --> 18:01.976
He never messed with me,
I never messed with him.

18:02.309 --> 18:05.346
We in different games.
I always had respect.

18:05.879 --> 18:07.180
So why'd he hit me now?

18:07.182 --> 18:08.316
Oh, I know why.

18:08.549 --> 18:09.882
He thinks
you're setting your sights

18:09.884 --> 18:12.054
on something higher,
you're getting sloppy.

18:13.288 --> 18:15.354
Mrs. Rawlings,
I'm Jack Mulligan.

18:15.356 --> 18:16.421
I had the privilege of working

18:16.423 --> 18:18.090
with your husband
a couple of times.

18:18.092 --> 18:19.458
He was a wonderful man.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.059
I'm so sorry for your loss.

18:21.061 --> 18:23.696
If there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to ask.

18:23.698 --> 18:25.430
I'm not a hard man to find.

18:25.432 --> 18:27.602
- Thank you.
- God bless.

18:42.017 --> 18:45.450
Harry wouldn't have liked it.
The backhoe.

18:45.452 --> 18:47.422
Should've hired gravediggers.

18:48.088 --> 18:50.759
I don't think they have
gravediggers anymore.

18:53.126 --> 18:54.427
I want you to give me the names

18:54.429 --> 18:56.398
of all the men
that died with Harry.

20:37.097 --> 20:38.230
Who is it?

20:38.232 --> 20:41.433
Mrs. Rawlings,
my name is Jamal Manning.

20:41.435 --> 20:43.038
I'm a friend of Harry's.

20:44.905 --> 20:46.805
Evening, Mrs. Rawlings.
My name is Jamal Manning.

20:46.807 --> 20:48.306
I'm running for alderman
of the 18th ward.

20:48.308 --> 20:49.440
This is not the 18th ward.

20:49.442 --> 20:50.910
Yes, but I'd like
to have a word with you

20:50.912 --> 20:52.277
to discuss some
urgent matters if you...

20:52.279 --> 20:53.347
No.

20:53.681 --> 20:55.646
It's not the 18th ward!
Get out!

20:55.648 --> 20:57.650
Come here, little fella.

20:57.652 --> 20:59.219
Because I didn't know
your husband.

20:59.221 --> 21:01.823
I didn't know your husband,
not really. Mm-mm.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.392
But he stole
two million dollars from me.

21:05.727 --> 21:07.459
He stole it...
right out of a van

21:07.461 --> 21:09.029
like he knew where it would be.

21:09.262 --> 21:10.496
I just wanna know why.

21:14.702 --> 21:17.702
I'm not involved in my
husband's business at all

21:17.704 --> 21:19.640
and I don't know
why you're here.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.577
It'll only take
a moment to discuss.

21:24.345 --> 21:26.413
Oh, yes.

21:30.285 --> 21:32.921
Mama's got a big house, yeah?

21:37.459 --> 21:38.759
See this one?

21:39.794 --> 21:41.229
Still haven't read that.

21:43.364 --> 21:46.498
Everybody out there involved
in Harry Rawlings' business

21:46.500 --> 21:48.133
as far as the eye can see.

21:48.135 --> 21:52.106
But you, you here living
with him, and you're not.

21:52.573 --> 21:53.940
I didn't work for Harry.

21:53.942 --> 21:55.641
I work for the teachers' union.

21:55.643 --> 21:57.742
I understand.

21:57.744 --> 22:00.781
Criminals like cops, they
don't bring their shit home.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.083
You have no idea, do you?

22:04.484 --> 22:06.352
Or did you choose not to know?

22:06.354 --> 22:07.556
It doesn't matter.

22:09.490 --> 22:11.026
Please join me.

22:12.359 --> 22:13.994
Oh, come on. I don't bite.

22:14.327 --> 22:15.495
Hey...

22:15.829 --> 22:18.498
What do they
say about dogs, huh?

22:18.500 --> 22:20.134
That they're good judges
of character?

22:22.436 --> 22:25.773
You see, that money
was meant to...

22:26.539 --> 22:27.672
buy me a new life,

22:27.674 --> 22:29.741
help with my campaign.
You understand?

22:29.743 --> 22:30.942
Listen, I don't have your money.

22:30.944 --> 22:32.644
Now, why don't you
just go out and make more?

22:32.646 --> 22:34.779
This is about my life!

22:34.781 --> 22:36.750
This is about my life.

22:39.119 --> 22:41.454
Because it's about my life,
it now becomes about yours.

22:41.721 --> 22:43.689
I told you.
I don't know anything...

22:43.691 --> 22:44.789
No, and even if that's true,

22:44.791 --> 22:46.192
you have a nice penthouse here.

22:46.559 --> 22:47.994
You got a lot of nice furniture,

22:47.996 --> 22:49.836
you got cars, you got
a closet full of clothes,

22:50.030 --> 22:52.466
none of which burnt up
in the van, by the way.

22:52.834 --> 22:54.700
I'll give you
one month to liquidate.

22:54.702 --> 22:55.702
I'll call the police.

22:55.936 --> 22:57.370
Mrs. Rawlings, do you know
what the police did

22:57.372 --> 22:59.341
the night
that Harry died? Do you?

23:00.540 --> 23:02.542
They laughed.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.910
They laughed
over his melted, burnt body,

23:04.912 --> 23:07.212
and they scraped whatever
they could into a bag

23:07.214 --> 23:08.713
and they went to a bar
to celebrate,

23:08.715 --> 23:10.682
because they give zero fucks

23:10.684 --> 23:13.621
about Harry Rawlings'
fucking widow.

23:15.623 --> 23:17.092
You're nothing now.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.096
Welcome back.

23:25.599 --> 23:28.202
So, uh, my money...

23:29.237 --> 23:30.238
one month.

23:37.444 --> 23:38.878
What the hell are you doing?

23:39.313 --> 23:42.648
How'd you get in here?
Who the hell are you?

23:42.650 --> 23:43.952
Who the hell are you?

23:45.219 --> 23:46.518
I'm calling the cops.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.585
And saying what?

23:47.587 --> 23:49.388
That you're in my fucking store!

23:49.390 --> 23:51.623
That wouldn't be true.
This is not your store.

23:51.625 --> 23:54.095
Obviously, your loser husband
didn't tell you.

23:54.496 --> 23:55.626
You knew him?

23:55.628 --> 23:58.163
Yes, and he knows
this is not your store.

23:58.165 --> 24:00.865
I have a lease.
I pay that shit every month!

24:00.867 --> 24:02.701
You gave that money to Carlos,

24:02.703 --> 24:04.268
and he spent it all at Arlington

24:04.270 --> 24:06.574
until the money ran out,
and he couldn't keep up.

24:06.906 --> 24:08.440
Then he started paying it to us.

24:08.442 --> 24:11.476
Then he fell behind,
then he gave us the store.

24:11.478 --> 24:13.314
Or, to be fair, we took it.

24:13.614 --> 24:14.746
It's like this.

24:14.748 --> 24:16.649
Carlos doesn't own it,
you don't own it.

24:16.651 --> 24:17.882
It's a system.

24:17.884 --> 24:19.884
Fuck your system!
That's my money!

24:19.886 --> 24:22.354
Maybe I'm
not explaining this clearly.

24:22.356 --> 24:24.425
- Ask Carlos.
- He's dead.

24:25.291 --> 24:26.290
Condolences.

24:26.292 --> 24:28.561
I'm just collecting
a debt here, ma'am.

24:29.096 --> 24:31.630
He should've loved you more
and the bookies less.

26:33.688 --> 26:35.886
Mrs. Rawlings,
I wanted to say that, uh,

26:35.888 --> 26:37.422
you don't have to keep me
hanging around

26:37.424 --> 26:40.158
the way that Harry did, if you
don't want. You can hire

26:40.160 --> 26:41.893
- someone else, if you want.
- I can't afford to hire

26:41.895 --> 26:43.828
someone else, Bash.
I can't even afford to keep you.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.430
You don't have to worry.

26:45.432 --> 26:49.404
I can always get a job working
security at a bar part-time.

26:53.673 --> 26:55.309
What if you keep the car?

26:57.045 --> 26:59.179
- This car?
- Yeah, you drive me around,

26:59.445 --> 27:02.015
you get me back on my feet,
and you keep the car.

27:03.850 --> 27:05.519
Where do you wanna go?

27:19.400 --> 27:20.700
The people I know

27:20.702 --> 27:24.271
are never gonna pay you
for a notebook, Mrs. Rawlings.

27:26.106 --> 27:28.206
So, let's pretend
you just came down here

27:28.208 --> 27:31.312
to refill Harry's flask
and have a drink.

27:32.613 --> 27:36.951
What if I told you that
Harry owed a lot of money...

27:37.952 --> 27:39.988
and now those people
want it from me?

27:41.021 --> 27:42.722
And what if I told you...

27:43.190 --> 27:46.527
a construction accident
didn't put me in this chair?

27:47.260 --> 27:48.629
A debt did.

27:51.398 --> 27:53.367
This is not your world.

27:56.002 --> 27:58.572
Use that notebook
to settle the debt.

27:59.140 --> 28:00.642
They might take it.

28:02.410 --> 28:04.545
It's what Harry
would have wanted.

28:07.515 --> 28:09.350
Render unto Caesar...

28:09.784 --> 28:12.687
what is Caesar's,
Mrs. Rawlings.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.455
Albert Woodfox
organized a chapter

28:16.457 --> 28:19.190
of the Black Panther Party
in Angola Prison,

28:19.192 --> 28:22.160
then spent 44 years in solitary.

28:22.162 --> 28:25.663
Yeah, I don't know
if I have the adequate words

28:25.665 --> 28:28.967
to describe what it's like
to be in a state

28:28.969 --> 28:31.036
of where nothing you do

28:31.038 --> 28:33.406
is gonna change your situation.

28:33.807 --> 28:35.874
I went almost 20 years

28:35.876 --> 28:38.175
without any
disciplinary reports.

28:38.177 --> 28:39.443
It made no difference

28:39.445 --> 28:41.513
when I went
before the review board.

28:41.515 --> 28:44.950
No matter how much you change,

28:44.952 --> 28:47.087
it makes no difference.

28:57.765 --> 28:58.967
Bash.

29:01.836 --> 29:03.471
I need those names.

29:08.075 --> 29:09.477
Yes, ma'am.

29:13.446 --> 29:16.847
Oh, my God!
It smells like a dead rat!

29:16.849 --> 29:18.519
I think I should get a job.

29:19.086 --> 29:22.153
As what?
A house cleaner?

29:22.155 --> 29:23.523
Serve coffee?

29:24.023 --> 29:25.990
Why would you ever do that?

29:25.992 --> 29:27.191
What else am I gonna do?

29:27.193 --> 29:29.260
I went from your home
to Florek's home.

29:29.262 --> 29:32.766
Men are supposed
to provide for you.

29:34.602 --> 29:36.133
Where did all the money go?

29:36.135 --> 29:38.002
I told you, Ma. We spent it.

29:38.004 --> 29:39.806
Wanted me to have a nice life.

29:40.207 --> 29:42.643
How much did you
get for your things?

29:43.644 --> 29:45.113
Three thousand.

29:45.512 --> 29:46.978
What about the bike?

29:46.980 --> 29:48.213
Gave it to Florek's friend.

29:48.215 --> 29:49.616
What am I gonna do with a bike?

29:50.050 --> 29:51.717
You idiot!

29:51.719 --> 29:54.219
- You never ask for enough!
- Why? I should be like you

29:54.221 --> 29:55.953
and ask for everything,
like I deserve it?

29:55.955 --> 29:57.354
Drive my husband in the ground?

29:57.356 --> 29:59.559
Take care of myself
before my children?

30:05.965 --> 30:07.534
I'm sorry, Mama.

30:08.367 --> 30:10.370
I just don't know what to do.

30:18.511 --> 30:21.848
Such a beautiful girl I made.

30:22.348 --> 30:24.351
I wanna show you something.

30:31.357 --> 30:33.627
It's an arrangement site.

30:36.363 --> 30:38.730
Alitzia, these girls are smart.

30:38.732 --> 30:41.134
They go out one night a week
and make as much

30:41.335 --> 30:44.038
as they'd make
in a month at a 7-Eleven.

30:44.404 --> 30:46.706
On top of that,
if you're sweet...

30:47.941 --> 30:49.343
like you...

30:50.044 --> 30:52.110
they get bonuses.
They get jewelry.

30:52.112 --> 30:54.715
They get treated
like a princess.

30:55.682 --> 30:58.219
And they go to college.

30:58.986 --> 31:01.689
That's what I want for you,
sweetheart.

31:02.689 --> 31:04.358
Is that so wrong?

31:07.094 --> 31:09.630
I'm not gonna sleep
with men I don't know.

31:11.198 --> 31:12.834
That ain't my life.

31:15.236 --> 31:16.838
What do you mean by that?

31:21.107 --> 31:24.077
Who the fuck do you
think you are, Alitzia?

31:24.577 --> 31:27.913
You forget whose roof
you slept under

31:28.347 --> 31:32.419
when you were 16, 17, 15.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.491
So don't act like you're
the fucking Virgin Mary.

31:38.992 --> 31:41.128
Those boys didn't pay me.

31:44.531 --> 31:46.733
Everybody,
thanks for coming today.

31:47.701 --> 31:50.904
Today, we are
standing on a vacant lot.

31:51.337 --> 31:53.673
But tomorrow, thanks to MWOW,

31:53.906 --> 31:57.077
the Minority Women Owned Work
initiative my father started,

31:57.377 --> 31:59.244
this will be
a thriving business,

31:59.246 --> 32:02.482
owned and operated
by the women of this ward.

32:02.782 --> 32:04.382
And it is my dream

32:04.384 --> 32:07.052
to continue that amazing work
that my father began,

32:07.054 --> 32:09.555
because this
is the 14th business

32:09.557 --> 32:11.657
that has opened
in the past three years.

32:11.659 --> 32:13.525
As long as there is
a Mulligan in office,

32:13.527 --> 32:16.363
there will be 14 more
in my first term, I promise.

32:16.797 --> 32:18.399
Now, can I get an "M-Wow"?

32:18.865 --> 32:20.164
M-Wow!

32:20.166 --> 32:21.400
Can I get an "M-Wow"?

32:21.402 --> 32:22.901
M-Wow!
- All right, all right.

32:22.903 --> 32:23.768
Now, where are my, uh...

32:23.770 --> 32:25.103
- Where are my success stories?
- Yes!

32:25.105 --> 32:26.304
- We got some success stories.
- Come on.

32:26.306 --> 32:27.338
Mr. Mulligan,
we want to talk about

32:27.340 --> 32:28.440
the audit that just came out.

32:28.442 --> 32:30.209
- Come on up!
- All right, let's...

32:30.211 --> 32:31.509
Perhaps some
of your constituents

32:31.511 --> 32:32.911
will be interested
to hear about it.

32:32.946 --> 32:36.248
These women, they aren't just
in business for themselves.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.482
They're in business
for the whole community.

32:38.484 --> 32:39.718
Over a million dollars

32:39.720 --> 32:41.353
they have generated
in the past three years.

32:41.355 --> 32:43.153
That's money that goes back
into the community.

32:43.155 --> 32:44.823
It's money that stays here,

32:44.825 --> 32:46.290
- in the 18th ward.
- Mr. Mulligan,

32:46.292 --> 32:47.625
an audit by the Cook County
comptroller

32:47.627 --> 32:49.160
shows over five million
dollars in overages...

32:49.162 --> 32:50.362
All right. Here we go.

32:50.364 --> 32:51.541
From the proposed

32:51.565 --> 32:52.941
- extension of the Green Line.
- M-Wow!

32:52.965 --> 32:55.232
During that time, you were
head of the CTA's commission.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.300
- Congratulations.
- A position

32:56.302 --> 32:57.870
you were appointed to
by your father.

32:57.872 --> 32:59.738
Do you care to comment on the
contracts you awarded while

32:59.740 --> 33:01.506
- serving on the commission?
- Mr. McRoberts. Sorry.

33:01.508 --> 33:03.342
I'll see you all on the 7th.
Thank you for coming out.

33:03.344 --> 33:05.376
Come on, Jack!
Give me a quote I can use.

33:05.378 --> 33:07.144
What about the contracts
you awarded

33:07.146 --> 33:08.279
while serving on the commission?

33:08.281 --> 33:09.458
All right, that's, uh...

33:09.482 --> 33:10.783
What about
the proposed extension

33:10.785 --> 33:12.316
- of the Green Line?
- That's enough questions,

33:12.318 --> 33:13.351
- thank you.
- The Green Line

33:13.353 --> 33:14.793
should serve
the people of this ward.

33:14.988 --> 33:17.021
Now, it can bring customers
to business like this

33:17.023 --> 33:20.191
and at the end of the day, it
can take tired workers home.

33:20.193 --> 33:21.825
Without that kind
of infrastructure

33:21.827 --> 33:25.096
MWOW is just another
empty gesture doomed to fail.

33:25.098 --> 33:26.297
You asked me about my father.

33:26.299 --> 33:28.432
My father taught me
about this neighborhood.

33:28.434 --> 33:30.367
He taught me
to empower the very people

33:30.369 --> 33:32.836
that this city has
overlooked for so long.

33:32.838 --> 33:34.338
But I'll see you, 18th,

33:34.340 --> 33:36.240
and I'll make sure
the rest of Chicago does, too.

33:36.242 --> 33:37.542
Thank you.

33:37.544 --> 33:39.614
End fucking quote.

33:43.182 --> 33:45.583
That fucking scumbag McRoberts!

33:45.585 --> 33:46.665
Won't he ever just give up?

33:46.987 --> 33:49.453
He's been shit on the sole
of my family's shoes forever.

33:49.455 --> 33:51.155
I wouldn't worry
about McRoberts.

33:51.157 --> 33:52.323
I'd be more worried
about the numbers.

33:52.325 --> 33:53.458
Your friend Jamal's no joke.

33:53.460 --> 33:54.828
Fucking Jamal...

33:58.898 --> 34:01.334
Tell me, have you ever slept
with a black guy?

34:01.934 --> 34:03.367
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

34:03.369 --> 34:04.809
Have you ever slept
with a black guy?

34:05.105 --> 34:07.171
What does that have
to do with Jamal, or anything?

34:07.173 --> 34:08.708
Just answer
the fucking question.

34:10.743 --> 34:13.545
We are in a situation
where you could lose everything.

34:13.946 --> 34:15.279
You've got the IG's office

34:15.281 --> 34:16.480
and the Feds
breathing down your neck.

34:16.482 --> 34:17.949
You got Jamal Manning
climbing in the polls,

34:17.952 --> 34:18.995
and all you're concerned with

34:19.018 --> 34:20.518
is whether or not
your dick is bigger than his?

34:20.520 --> 34:22.120
What are we
fighting for? This?

34:22.121 --> 34:23.522
You know how many
shootings happened

34:23.524 --> 34:24.822
in this city last weekend alone?

34:24.824 --> 34:27.895
Thirty-four! These people
are killing each other!

34:28.293 --> 34:30.761
This is not where
I wanna raise my children.

34:30.763 --> 34:33.433
What are we
fighting for exactly?

34:35.234 --> 34:36.500
I feel suffocated!

34:36.502 --> 34:38.136
I'm not a Mulligan,
I'm my mother's son!

34:38.138 --> 34:39.370
God rest her soul!

34:39.371 --> 34:41.371
The shit she had to put up
with from my father!

34:41.373 --> 34:42.505
I'm putting up with it, too.

34:42.507 --> 34:43.774
That's what adults do, Jack.

34:43.775 --> 34:45.476
I never wanted to be
in this fucking business

34:45.478 --> 34:48.380
and that's all this is.
It's a fucking business!

34:50.783 --> 34:54.185
Christ! I just wanna
be free of this shit.

34:54.187 --> 34:55.351
Can't take it anymore, I just...

34:55.353 --> 34:56.754
Wake the fuck up, Jack.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.489
You are not going
to pussy out now.

34:58.491 --> 34:59.857
What are you gonna do?
Work in a bank?

34:59.859 --> 35:01.893
Take the train downtown,
punch a clock?

35:01.895 --> 35:03.227
This is your life!

35:03.229 --> 35:05.932
This is our life.
It's what we do.

35:06.533 --> 35:07.765
Everyone has
a fucking sob story,

35:07.767 --> 35:09.234
most of them better than yours.

35:09.236 --> 35:10.701
So, if the idea is to be
mayor one day,

35:10.703 --> 35:12.539
you'd better man the fuck up!

35:14.741 --> 35:15.843
Jesus.

35:22.082 --> 35:24.417
Dollar signs and empty promises.

35:26.086 --> 35:29.754
Anybody who thinks different
are fooling themselves.

35:29.756 --> 35:31.725
It's the God's honest truth.

35:33.093 --> 35:34.494
Thanks, John.

35:47.808 --> 35:48.876
Fellas!

35:53.680 --> 35:56.049
I can't believe
none of us have ever met.

35:56.517 --> 35:58.616
Are you sure we
should've ordered champagne?

35:58.618 --> 36:00.488
She invited us.
It's fine.

36:00.821 --> 36:03.321
So she didn't tell you
anything else on the phone?

36:03.323 --> 36:05.960
Nothing.
Just the time and place.

36:08.127 --> 36:09.928
Is one of you Alice?

36:09.930 --> 36:11.495
- Mm.
- Amanda?

36:11.497 --> 36:13.332
I'm Linda. Who's Amanda?

36:13.700 --> 36:14.899
Let's hope it doesn't matter.

36:14.901 --> 36:16.869
I'm Veronica Rawlings,
Harry's wife.

36:17.136 --> 36:18.538
You're Harry's wife?

36:19.038 --> 36:20.441
How'd you two meet?

36:20.908 --> 36:22.042
Follow me.

36:23.577 --> 36:26.377
Your husbands worked
a long time for my husband.

36:26.379 --> 36:27.881
With your husband.

36:31.417 --> 36:32.952
How you doing for money?

36:35.221 --> 36:37.825
Here. To tide you over.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.593
Till what?

36:52.138 --> 36:53.740
How are the children?

36:54.640 --> 36:55.809
She's the one with the kids.

36:56.477 --> 36:57.778
They're fine.

37:00.212 --> 37:02.216
I have a business proposition.

37:07.787 --> 37:10.190
If you have
a high-risk threshold.

37:18.298 --> 37:19.500
Listen.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.401
We're in trouble.

37:22.301 --> 37:25.437
It was Jamal Manning's money
that our husbands stole.

37:25.439 --> 37:26.571
Who's that?

37:26.573 --> 37:27.933
Somebody you
don't wanna fuck with.

37:28.341 --> 37:29.741
The money burnt up in the van,

37:29.743 --> 37:31.845
and Jamal Manning,
he wants it back.

37:32.145 --> 37:33.480
From us? Or from you?

37:33.747 --> 37:36.413
Harry left me the plans
for his next job.

37:36.415 --> 37:37.883
It's worth five million dollars.

37:38.118 --> 37:39.049
I take two million,

37:39.051 --> 37:40.718
give it to the Mannings.
We split the rest.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.687
- You want us to...
- Pull off the job, yeah.

37:42.689 --> 37:43.923
A million apiece.

37:44.558 --> 37:45.559
A million?

37:45.892 --> 37:47.991
Maybe you have a secret plan
or a special skill

37:47.993 --> 37:49.727
that can make you
that kind of money.

37:49.729 --> 37:51.730
But if you don't,
there's an address

37:51.732 --> 37:53.832
in the pads of money
that I just gave you.

37:53.834 --> 37:56.100
Meet me there
tomorrow at 11:15.

37:56.102 --> 37:57.503
What if we say no?

37:57.870 --> 37:59.939
She'll give him our names.

38:06.979 --> 38:08.212
11:15 AM?

38:08.214 --> 38:09.214
PM.

38:09.383 --> 38:11.582
- It's not easy. I have kids.
- I don't want any trouble.

38:11.584 --> 38:13.987
Listen, our lives are in danger.

38:14.287 --> 38:16.523
Our husbands aren't coming back.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.225
We're on our own.

38:19.526 --> 38:21.127
Now, I'll be there tomorrow.

38:23.062 --> 38:24.798
I hope to see you there.

38:36.743 --> 38:40.781
So, what has
happened in the world...

38:41.415 --> 38:44.151
that normal now
passes as excellence?

38:45.386 --> 38:47.755
When did we lower our standards?

38:49.290 --> 38:51.189
There seems to be no expectation

38:51.191 --> 38:54.526
to go above and beyond
what one might know.

38:54.528 --> 38:57.196
- Yeah. Yes, sir.
- Or might want to know.

38:57.964 --> 39:03.201
It seems people are blissful
in their own ignorance.

39:04.604 --> 39:07.174
How far have we fallen?

39:08.207 --> 39:10.142
Indeed, how far have we fallen?

39:10.144 --> 39:13.879
We are living in an environment
where people are blind!

39:14.647 --> 39:17.214
What you don't see,
you don't know.

39:17.216 --> 39:18.917
Out of sight, out of mind.

39:18.919 --> 39:21.685
So now ignorance
is the new normal.

39:23.691 --> 39:28.060
In fact, ignorance...
Ignorance is the new excellence.

39:28.062 --> 39:32.830
The less you know
the more seemingly you gain.

39:34.167 --> 39:36.937
Not to care is deemed
to be smart.

39:38.004 --> 39:40.839
When you subtract
love from any equation,

39:40.841 --> 39:43.774
from any situation,
from any location,

39:43.776 --> 39:48.613
the result is always hurt
and pain on all sides.

39:50.683 --> 39:53.584
That is why
we need to bring love

39:53.586 --> 39:55.388
back into the equation.

39:57.524 --> 39:59.256
Love.

39:59.258 --> 40:01.192
In Jesus' words,

40:01.194 --> 40:04.431
"Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself."

40:05.131 --> 40:07.665
So he can hear you on high,
say it with me.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.500
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor

40:09.502 --> 40:10.801
- "as thyself."
- Amen!

40:10.803 --> 40:13.073
Even when it ain't easy!

40:14.475 --> 40:16.210
Even when
you've been done wrong!

40:17.977 --> 40:20.413
When this world's got you down
on your knees...

40:21.346 --> 40:24.250
love thy neighbor as thyself.

40:26.486 --> 40:27.954
All right. Amen.

40:30.990 --> 40:33.457
Noel, how are you, my brother?

40:33.459 --> 40:34.526
Reverend Wheeler.

40:34.961 --> 40:37.629
I'd like to introduce you
to Jamal Manning.

40:37.631 --> 40:39.263
- Jamal...
- Yeah.

40:39.265 --> 40:40.625
You know,
that's Arabic for beauty,

40:41.000 --> 40:42.801
and it is beautiful to see you.

40:42.803 --> 40:44.734
It is so good to meet you,
Reverend.

40:44.736 --> 40:46.171
I've admired you from afar.

40:46.173 --> 40:48.272
Now you can do it up close.

40:48.274 --> 40:49.873
Take a seat. Take a seat.

40:51.276 --> 40:52.745
How about I go first?

40:53.013 --> 40:54.013
Please.

40:54.180 --> 40:57.015
Now, as of the last poll,
you were down by 12 points.

40:57.017 --> 40:59.917
Now it's nine. Margin
of error, could be seven.

40:59.919 --> 41:01.621
Could also be 11, too.

41:01.955 --> 41:03.390
Thought I was going first?

41:04.589 --> 41:06.524
Election's in less than a month.

41:06.526 --> 41:07.926
If I was a doctor,
I'd be telling you

41:07.928 --> 41:09.328
to get your affairs in order.

41:09.962 --> 41:12.096
Three weeks from now,
you won't need a doctor.

41:12.098 --> 41:14.565
You'll be asking someone like
me to give you last rites.

41:14.567 --> 41:15.700
So says you.

41:15.702 --> 41:17.102
So says me.

41:17.337 --> 41:18.335
Exactly. Me, the guy

41:18.337 --> 41:20.370
with the largest congregation
in your ward

41:20.372 --> 41:22.141
and an even larger outreach.

41:23.243 --> 41:26.076
I've known the Mulligans
since I became a pastor.

41:26.078 --> 41:27.745
No, he's not helping anybody.

41:27.747 --> 41:29.750
Like I said, I know him.

41:29.950 --> 41:33.185
So you're endorsing
the Mulligans. Can we go now?

41:33.187 --> 41:34.288
I didn't say that.

41:35.288 --> 41:37.323
The ward has been redrawn.

41:37.758 --> 41:39.493
The Mulligans
weren't playing ball.

41:39.792 --> 41:42.561
For the first time,
someone like us has a shot.

41:42.828 --> 41:44.094
I'd be an idiot to ignore that.

41:44.096 --> 41:45.999
I'm gonna cut to the chase
here, Reverend.

41:46.533 --> 41:49.067
I'm in the driving seat, I just
don't have a set of wheels.

41:49.468 --> 41:51.935
All I need is your endorsement
and your contribution

41:51.937 --> 41:54.073
to help me
get across the finish line.

41:54.607 --> 41:56.910
How much of a contribution
do you need?

41:57.743 --> 41:59.345
And what's it worth to you?

41:59.678 --> 42:01.981
You mean worth
in terms of funding?

42:02.381 --> 42:04.848
I can fill you in on that,
but what matters

42:04.850 --> 42:06.584
is that you're with us.

42:08.620 --> 42:10.456
Someone's ears are burning.

42:10.957 --> 42:13.558
Gentlemen, let's discuss this
further another time.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.362
One always must
weigh out options.

42:15.629 --> 42:18.365
Jack Mulligan.
How are you, my brother?

42:19.566 --> 42:20.964
No, you know me.

42:20.966 --> 42:22.734
Praising Jesus, as always.

42:22.736 --> 42:24.203
Mm-hmm.

42:24.571 --> 42:27.241
Mm-hmm.
School was good?

42:28.642 --> 42:29.808
Okay, I gotta get back to work.

42:29.810 --> 42:31.341
Can you put your
grandma on the phone?

42:31.343 --> 42:32.345
Mommy loves you.

42:33.245 --> 42:36.212
Hey, Ma, will you
put her to bed for me?

42:36.214 --> 42:37.982
I'll be back as soon
as I can, all right?

42:37.984 --> 42:39.618
You keep asking me,

42:39.620 --> 42:41.260
- asking me for money...
- All right, bye.

42:43.423 --> 42:44.756
So, I asked her,

42:44.758 --> 42:46.368
how does she know it was true?
Who told her?

42:46.392 --> 42:48.326
I'm tired of y'all
motherfuckers coming up here...

42:48.328 --> 42:49.993
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

42:49.995 --> 42:51.194
What'd you call me?

42:51.196 --> 42:53.966
You deaf?
Motherfucker. Goodbye.

43:00.006 --> 43:01.641
What is going on?

43:01.941 --> 43:03.876
Who was that,
and what does he want?

43:04.511 --> 43:05.910
I don't want to talk about it.

43:05.912 --> 43:06.977
Breechelle, are you in trouble?

43:06.979 --> 43:08.513
I said
I don't want to talk about it.

43:08.515 --> 43:10.635
How long am I supposed
to be under this thing?

43:13.587 --> 43:14.888
Thank you.

43:15.921 --> 43:17.488
I'm sorry about all that.

43:17.490 --> 43:18.955
Oh, that's all right.

43:18.957 --> 43:20.860
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

44:08.707 --> 44:10.142
Wait for me here.

44:11.044 --> 44:13.343
I really don't think this is
a good idea, Mrs. Rawlings.

44:13.345 --> 44:15.081
Bash, give me the key.

46:02.589 --> 46:04.458
Hey, I'm meeting someone here.

46:09.229 --> 46:10.430
You must be Alice.

46:11.231 --> 46:12.832
You look just like you.

46:13.332 --> 46:14.835
I'll take that as a compliment.

46:15.102 --> 46:16.470
Have a seat.

46:19.973 --> 46:21.241
And you should.

46:22.008 --> 46:24.274
Although, I gotta say,

46:24.276 --> 46:26.545
you're even more
stunning in person.

46:28.714 --> 46:29.980
I'm David.

46:29.982 --> 46:31.218
David...

46:31.917 --> 46:33.220
Just David for now.

46:33.986 --> 46:35.320
Can I get you a drink?

46:35.620 --> 46:37.455
- Definitely.
- Yeah?

46:37.457 --> 46:38.589
Vodka rocks.

46:38.591 --> 46:39.457
Okay.

46:39.459 --> 46:41.161
Excellent.
Are you from Russia?

46:41.461 --> 46:42.662
No, I'm Polish.

46:42.995 --> 46:44.194
American.

46:44.196 --> 46:45.632
My grandma came over, but...

46:46.531 --> 46:47.734
I just like vodka.

46:48.167 --> 46:49.866
Hey, excuse me,
can you get Alice here

46:49.868 --> 46:51.303
a vodka rocks, please?

46:52.839 --> 46:54.174
What are you drinking?

46:54.573 --> 46:55.608
Just ginger ale.

46:57.243 --> 46:58.778
Have you done this before?

46:59.511 --> 47:01.680
I'm not really sure
what you mean.

47:03.183 --> 47:04.751
If I said no,
what would you say?

47:06.252 --> 47:08.355
I would probably say
something reassuring.

47:09.856 --> 47:11.223
Okay. Do that.

47:12.691 --> 47:13.692
Okay.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.627
Well, Alice...

47:16.261 --> 47:18.298
I feel lucky
to have met you tonight...

47:18.832 --> 47:21.600
and hopefully, in time,
you'll feel the same way.

47:25.470 --> 47:26.472
Cheers.

47:41.854 --> 47:43.089
Mommy!

47:43.522 --> 47:44.754
Baby. Hey.

47:47.026 --> 47:48.259
You look beat.

47:48.261 --> 47:50.259
I've been up since 5:30.
I had to...

47:52.832 --> 47:53.933
Hello?

47:54.399 --> 47:56.901
Bailee, it's okay. Come here.
Come here, baby.

47:56.903 --> 47:59.136
I can take the bus. I'll be
there in about 20 minutes.

47:59.138 --> 48:00.538
Come here, sweetie.

48:00.540 --> 48:03.006
Cabs are a little hard for me.
Twenty minutes.

48:03.008 --> 48:04.542
Baby, you just got home.

48:04.544 --> 48:06.143
Twelve bucks an hour.
I gotta take it.

48:06.145 --> 48:07.245
Bailee's been waiting for you

48:07.247 --> 48:08.527
- all night.
- Ma, please.

48:09.182 --> 48:11.015
At least let me
fix you something to eat!

48:11.017 --> 48:12.252
I'mma be back.

48:30.002 --> 48:31.437
I see you!

48:33.638 --> 48:35.774
You can't run
from a brother, baby!

48:46.819 --> 48:47.819
That one.

48:48.486 --> 48:50.354
That one's
the Jewelers' Building,

48:50.356 --> 48:52.256
designed by
Giaver and Dinkelberg.

48:52.258 --> 48:53.826
Five hundred and twenty three
feet.

48:54.093 --> 48:55.294
How do you know all that?

48:55.794 --> 48:59.164
I told you,
I develop buildings. Big ones.

48:59.432 --> 49:02.301
Some you can see from here,
some in other countries.

49:02.935 --> 49:03.937
That one.

49:04.470 --> 49:06.305
That one is a hotel.

49:08.040 --> 49:09.276
You wanna go?

49:12.877 --> 49:15.448
Look, I promise, I'm a nice guy.

49:15.781 --> 49:17.116
I used to be married.

49:17.482 --> 49:20.720
Two years followed
by three shitty ones.

49:21.153 --> 49:22.856
I work 80 hours a week.

49:24.256 --> 49:26.258
I miss the intimacy.

49:27.459 --> 49:30.595
I miss the way women smell.
The way they talk.

49:31.296 --> 49:33.330
You want all the good stuff,
none of the bad.

49:33.332 --> 49:34.567
Don't you?

49:38.004 --> 49:39.937
- Belle? City Sitters?
- Yeah.

49:39.939 --> 49:41.875
Hi, I'm Linda. Come on in.

49:42.808 --> 49:44.308
I'll only be a few hours.

49:44.310 --> 49:45.879
Don't worry. I'm fine.

49:46.812 --> 49:48.446
Hey, I'm Belle.

49:48.448 --> 49:49.613
I'm gonna be hanging with you

49:49.615 --> 49:51.750
while your mom
does what she's gotta do.

49:52.884 --> 49:53.986
I've got one of my own.

49:54.185 --> 49:55.721
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

49:57.656 --> 50:00.290
Okay.
Well, you kids be good, okay?

50:28.321 --> 50:29.522
Hello.

50:33.558 --> 50:34.928
We're closed. Can I help you?

50:36.495 --> 50:38.431
I'm here with a few questions.

50:39.397 --> 50:41.367
About Harry Rawlings.

50:42.868 --> 50:43.734
I'm betting you heard

50:43.736 --> 50:45.438
he stole from
the Manning brothers.

50:46.138 --> 50:49.276
Really?
Score one for us, huh?

50:50.609 --> 50:52.310
I want you to tell me why.

50:52.944 --> 50:55.848
What makes you think
I care about your wants, huh?

50:57.049 --> 50:58.584
Oh, fuck!

51:03.589 --> 51:05.957
Jesus fucking Christ, you shit!

51:19.272 --> 51:20.604
Why'd he fucking do it?

51:24.310 --> 51:26.913
Let me ask you again.
Why'd he fucking do it?

51:27.379 --> 51:29.682
Get the fuck off me, man!

51:39.424 --> 51:40.991
I see you're paralyzed
from the waist down,

51:40.993 --> 51:42.125
but chest up... You feel this?

51:42.127 --> 51:43.495
What the fuck?

51:45.296 --> 51:46.897
Oh, you feel that.

51:46.899 --> 51:48.332
You fucking shit!

51:48.334 --> 51:49.768
Oh, man.

51:50.435 --> 51:53.038
Oh, this is like
that old game Operation.

51:54.307 --> 51:55.841
You know that old game?

51:56.107 --> 51:57.239
Fuck.

51:57.241 --> 51:58.643
Now, where the bread basket?

52:01.948 --> 52:03.616
So, once again...

52:04.316 --> 52:09.218
why... did... he... do it?

52:11.924 --> 52:13.290
Does his wife know?

52:13.292 --> 52:16.194
She doesn't know
anything about anything.

52:16.196 --> 52:18.531
Does that tickle? Mm?

52:18.832 --> 52:21.665
She's got his notebook, okay?
Just get the notebook.

52:21.667 --> 52:23.100
What I want with a notebook?

52:23.102 --> 52:24.370
Harry was old-school.

52:24.837 --> 52:28.404
Wrote every single detail
of every job down on paper.

52:28.406 --> 52:29.506
How that gonna help me?

52:29.508 --> 52:30.940
It's all in there.
Every contact,

52:30.942 --> 52:33.310
every bribe,
the last job, the next job.

52:33.312 --> 52:35.279
Down to the fucking
piss breaks, okay?

52:35.281 --> 52:36.583
You bullshitting me?

52:37.450 --> 52:39.886
She has it.
I swear, all right?

52:40.953 --> 52:43.089
Your swears
don't mean shit to me, dawg.

52:45.191 --> 52:46.623
I have a no-kill
order right now,

52:46.625 --> 52:48.093
so your timing
is very fortunate.

52:52.397 --> 52:54.031
If I find out
you're lying to me,

52:54.033 --> 52:56.970
there'll be an unfortunate
act of God, my nigga.

53:01.540 --> 53:03.174
You fucker!

53:07.078 --> 53:09.046
We can't do it, the two of us.

53:09.048 --> 53:10.647
It's over. She's a flake.

53:10.649 --> 53:13.450
- Just give her five minutes.
- Why?

53:13.452 --> 53:15.518
Because our lives
are trickier than yours.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.221
What's tricky
about being on time?

53:17.223 --> 53:18.663
If she can't show...

53:20.459 --> 53:22.529
What the hell are you wearing?

53:23.328 --> 53:24.663
A condom.

53:25.564 --> 53:28.230
I'm here. I didn't
have to come, but I did.

53:28.232 --> 53:29.267
We're screwed.

53:29.535 --> 53:31.067
You know what?
If you don't wanna be here,

53:31.069 --> 53:32.268
then maybe you shouldn't.

53:32.270 --> 53:33.703
There's the door. In or out?

53:33.705 --> 53:35.772
Out, and you take your chances
with the Mannings.

53:35.774 --> 53:37.373
In, and there's no going back.

53:37.375 --> 53:39.210
How do we even know
what "in" means?

53:39.212 --> 53:40.544
Why should we trust you, anyway?

53:40.546 --> 53:42.111
Because I'm the only one
standing between you

53:42.113 --> 53:43.647
and a bullet in your head.

53:43.649 --> 53:45.348
Because I wouldn't ask you
to do anything

53:45.350 --> 53:46.716
I wouldn't do myself.

53:46.718 --> 53:49.888
Leave...
and you're on your own.

53:56.796 --> 53:57.797
I'm in.

54:01.433 --> 54:02.634
In.

54:04.337 --> 54:07.873
Like I said, this next job
is worth five million dollars.

54:08.174 --> 54:10.473
From what I can tell
with Harry's notebook,

54:10.475 --> 54:12.875
the money is either in a house
or an apartment.

54:12.877 --> 54:15.078
So the first thing
we're gonna need is a van.

54:15.080 --> 54:17.515
Don't you have a car?
Probably a nice one.

54:17.517 --> 54:19.815
The car is registered
to Harry. Think.

54:19.817 --> 54:21.821
- I'll buy a van.
- Good. Progress.

54:22.087 --> 54:23.053
What do I do?

54:23.055 --> 54:24.823
Find out what this is
and where it is.

54:25.890 --> 54:27.658
What? How am I
supposed to do that?

54:27.660 --> 54:29.727
By being smarter
than you are right now.

54:29.729 --> 54:31.395
Listen, we'll work out
what we need,

54:31.397 --> 54:32.895
and we'll take it
from there, all right?

54:32.897 --> 54:35.198
We'll meet here on Wednesday,
same time,

54:35.200 --> 54:37.401
and I expect these items
to be off the list.

54:37.403 --> 54:39.506
I'm gonna need transport money.

54:42.274 --> 54:45.044
Phones. Use only in emergency.

54:46.178 --> 54:47.212
This is for the guns.

54:48.314 --> 54:50.580
- Guns?
- Three Glocks. Ammo, too.

54:50.582 --> 54:53.417
- No more than $2,000.
- Me? From where?

54:53.419 --> 54:55.054
It's America.

54:55.754 --> 54:58.191
Olivia.
Come on.

55:02.495 --> 55:03.826
You don't have a jacket?

55:03.828 --> 55:06.196
No. I think she's crazy.

55:06.198 --> 55:07.997
Yep. She's got money.

55:07.999 --> 55:09.868
Might as well see
where this goes.

55:12.805 --> 55:14.573
Hundred.
Hundred dollars.

55:15.540 --> 55:17.841
Nine, nine, can we get $900?
There's nine!

55:27.019 --> 55:30.790
Thirteen. We got 13.
To 13, 14, 14...

55:32.124 --> 55:34.892
Now 15, 16. And $1,500...

55:34.894 --> 55:38.928
Now, 16. Right now, 16, 17.
Took a bid. 18, $1,800...

55:38.930 --> 55:41.131
Nineteen. Can we get 19, 19, 19?

55:41.133 --> 55:44.134
You don't want this one.
The gearshift pops out at 60.

55:44.136 --> 55:45.902
And sold.
Buyer number seven.

55:45.904 --> 55:49.138
Next coming up.
'98 Dodge Ram van. '98.

55:49.140 --> 55:50.309
500, 550.

55:51.343 --> 55:52.676
Now, this one looks good,

55:52.678 --> 55:54.647
but you're gonna be
at the mechanic all the time.

55:59.819 --> 56:02.151
- What do you want this for?
- Sold it there.

56:02.153 --> 56:05.156
Here's what I need.
A van, good pickup, low miles.

56:05.158 --> 56:07.690
'05. Got the
white van. Got the white van.

56:07.692 --> 56:09.359
- Buy this one.
- Wait, which one?

56:09.361 --> 56:10.560
This one, this one.

56:10.562 --> 56:12.965
Five, 550.
Six, six. Somebody...

56:14.466 --> 56:16.134
Thank you now. Six, now seven.

56:19.171 --> 56:20.839
Eight now. Nine.

56:21.607 --> 56:23.707
No. You're going higher
than what it's worth.

56:25.343 --> 56:26.743
And six, six there now.

56:26.745 --> 56:28.847
- A lot higher.
- Will it do what I ask?

56:30.015 --> 56:32.582
Then it's not too much.
My boss is kind of a dick.

56:32.584 --> 56:34.984
One! Sold it there, $6,000.
Forty-seven.

56:34.986 --> 56:37.754
Buyer 47 bought it, $6,000.

56:37.756 --> 56:39.689
I won!

56:39.691 --> 56:41.123
So, where are we
gonna go celebrate, huh?

56:41.125 --> 56:44.196
Gold Chevy.
I'd say it's a $1,200.

56:44.796 --> 56:46.331
That was my first auction.

56:50.636 --> 56:51.704
Jennifer Christie?

56:51.937 --> 56:54.207
- Can I please have it delivered?
- This isn't Grubhub.

56:56.274 --> 56:58.408
How do you go
to a car auction to get a car,

56:58.410 --> 56:59.710
and you don't know how to drive?

56:59.712 --> 57:01.578
I didn't know they just
gave it to you right there.

57:01.580 --> 57:02.678
I can't think of everything.

57:02.680 --> 57:03.814
When I assign you a task,

57:03.816 --> 57:05.448
you're supposed
to complete that task.

57:05.450 --> 57:07.352
You were meant to drive.

57:08.120 --> 57:11.020
We're already one person down.
Now I have to ask Bash.

57:11.022 --> 57:12.855
- Who's Bash?
- Harry's driver.

57:12.857 --> 57:14.924
- Can we trust him?
- We have to now.

57:14.926 --> 57:16.794
- Why didn't you ask Linda?
- Because there is a plan!

57:16.796 --> 57:18.263
Just shut up!

57:18.930 --> 57:21.066
- How much you pay for it?
- Six thousand.

57:22.401 --> 57:23.701
The point of an auction

57:23.703 --> 57:25.468
is to spend less
than what you came with.

57:25.470 --> 57:27.072
It was a good deal.

57:30.709 --> 57:32.442
Don't let your dog
shit in my lap.

57:32.444 --> 57:33.746
She's house-trained.

57:39.952 --> 57:42.888
We have a lot of work to do.
Crying isn't on the list.

57:50.196 --> 57:53.363
Mom, why do we
have to go to Lita's today?

57:53.365 --> 57:54.964
Because she loves you.

57:54.966 --> 57:57.232
Because she's mad at you.

57:57.234 --> 57:58.236
I know.

58:17.256 --> 58:18.687
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:18.689 --> 58:20.424
I'm with Gaspar-Judd.

58:20.426 --> 58:22.393
This was designed by your firm

58:22.395 --> 58:26.032
and I was wondering if
you could tell me where it is.

58:26.466 --> 58:29.368
- I can't, really.
- What about who designed it?

58:30.269 --> 58:32.337
Wait a minute.
Let me ask someone.

58:51.591 --> 58:53.526
They told me
I can't tell you anything.

58:53.625 --> 58:56.094
It's my first week of work...

58:56.227 --> 58:57.529
My boss...

58:59.865 --> 59:01.901
It was designed by Delia Foster.

59:02.567 --> 59:03.667
Thank you.

59:09.241 --> 59:10.309
Shit.

59:19.051 --> 59:20.283
Good afternoon, folks.

59:20.285 --> 59:22.118
Thanks for coming
out here today.

59:22.120 --> 59:23.786
We're gonna be talking
a little bit

59:23.788 --> 59:25.055
about handgun marksmanship.

01:00:04.763 --> 01:00:06.062
I don't understand.

01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:07.264
I'm sorry,

01:00:07.399 --> 01:00:09.968
I'm hoping I could
get your help to buy gun.

01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:13.872
This is hard. I'm a,
how you say, mail-order bride?

01:00:14.506 --> 01:00:15.839
When I arrived, my husband,

01:00:15.841 --> 01:00:18.007
he took my visa,
passport, everything.

01:00:18.009 --> 01:00:19.875
He beat me, always.
I finally left.

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:20.944
I had to for my babies,

01:00:20.946 --> 01:00:22.678
but he swear
he going to kill me.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.781
I can't go to police.
I'm illegal.

01:00:24.783 --> 01:00:26.984
I want a gun just to feel safe.

01:00:26.986 --> 01:00:29.419
I have cash. I know what I need.
Will you help me?

01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:33.859
Mom, you always say
a gun is a girl's best friend.

01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:37.163
What do you need?

01:00:37.363 --> 01:00:38.931
Three Glock 17s.

01:00:39.631 --> 01:00:41.064
That's a lot of firepower.

01:00:41.066 --> 01:00:42.935
I want one for every room.

01:00:54.145 --> 01:00:56.245
- Mr. Foster?
- Yeah.

01:00:56.247 --> 01:01:00.684
Hi. I'm Annette Castille.
I work with Bridges and Getty.

01:01:00.952 --> 01:01:03.721
Oh, uh, I'm sorry,
I don't think we've met.

01:01:03.923 --> 01:01:05.323
Um, I'm new.

01:01:05.558 --> 01:01:09.658
I work mostly as a secretary
with Miss Christina Glickman.

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.563
Uh-huh. I think I know her.

01:01:11.997 --> 01:01:13.298
May I come in?

01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:15.501
Oh, um...

01:01:16.535 --> 01:01:18.437
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:01:22.841 --> 01:01:24.076
Here.

01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:26.310
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:01:27.212 --> 01:01:30.316
I was trying to get in touch
with your wife, Delia.

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:36.020
I have a few questions
about some projects.

01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:40.058
I have a client who would
really like to speak with her.

01:01:41.227 --> 01:01:42.595
I think you should leave.

01:01:43.696 --> 01:01:44.964
What? Why?

01:01:46.263 --> 01:01:50.000
I'm not interested in talking
to you or whoever sent you.

01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.335
Obviously,
you're not with Bridges,

01:01:51.337 --> 01:01:53.506
as everyone there knows,
my wife died.

01:01:54.705 --> 01:01:56.408
Four months ago.

01:01:59.011 --> 01:02:00.613
I'm sorry.

01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:05.017
I'm so sorry.

01:02:06.584 --> 01:02:08.119
I asked you to go.

01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:16.062
I lost my husband two weeks ago.

01:02:30.341 --> 01:02:31.343
Oh, my...

01:03:09.013 --> 01:03:11.116
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:35.807
What do I know
about blueprints anyway?

01:03:36.341 --> 01:03:38.107
She's probably gonna
make me walk the streets

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:40.178
of Chicago
until I find this place.

01:03:40.879 --> 01:03:42.146
Leave them with me.

01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:44.316
- What?
- Leave them with me.

01:03:47.986 --> 01:03:49.587
Come on. It's our stop.

01:04:24.455 --> 01:04:26.522
So, Harry Rawlings
kept some sort of diary.

01:04:26.524 --> 01:04:28.457
Liked to write
shit down longhand.

01:04:28.459 --> 01:04:30.593
- What kind of shit?
- Plans, people.

01:04:30.595 --> 01:04:33.129
Details on how he robbed us
and who was next.

01:04:33.131 --> 01:04:34.399
His woman has it.

01:04:34.832 --> 01:04:35.834
You sure?

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.502
Easy enough to find out.

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:41.639
That notebook could lead us
to some big money.

01:04:44.176 --> 01:04:45.744
You do not touch her.

01:04:46.212 --> 01:04:47.613
I don't need that type of heat.

01:04:49.013 --> 01:04:50.281
No touching.

01:04:51.149 --> 01:04:53.184
She got two weeks
to pay us back.

01:04:53.718 --> 01:04:54.819
If she don't...

01:04:55.553 --> 01:04:57.822
she gonna need more than
a notebook to bargain with.

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:14.569
Hello?

01:05:14.571 --> 01:05:18.810
It's Welsh.
Bobby Welsh, yeah, yeah.

01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:22.847
Have you, uh...
Have you given up that notebook?

01:05:25.316 --> 01:05:27.183
- Yes.
- You have?

01:05:27.185 --> 01:05:29.720
Good. Good.
That's smart. That's smart.

01:05:29.988 --> 01:05:31.486
Are you sure you're okay?

01:05:31.488 --> 01:05:34.225
Yes, thank you.
Thank you for calling.

01:05:34.892 --> 01:05:36.292
I have to go now, Mr. Welsh.

01:05:36.294 --> 01:05:37.995
Listen, if there's anything...

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:53.542
Seriously, Jack, what
the fuck are you gonna do?

01:05:53.544 --> 01:05:55.143
I'm gonna beat
his gay black ass.

01:05:55.145 --> 01:05:56.446
I'm ahead in the polls.

01:05:56.448 --> 01:05:58.415
It's a six-point lead,
and it's falling.

01:05:58.417 --> 01:05:59.683
Is he gay?

01:05:59.685 --> 01:06:01.951
He doesn't have
5.1 million question marks

01:06:01.953 --> 01:06:03.553
- around his name.
- Should never

01:06:03.555 --> 01:06:05.721
have taken the appointment
on the Green Line commission.

01:06:05.723 --> 01:06:08.390
Bad optics. You and your dad
should've known better.

01:06:08.392 --> 01:06:10.026
Green Line seems
to run right through

01:06:10.028 --> 01:06:11.460
your own personal cookie jar.

01:06:11.462 --> 01:06:13.529
Get the fuck out of here.
You don't believe that shit.

01:06:13.531 --> 01:06:15.765
Jesus Christ!
Trains are expensive.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:16.567
So are swimming pools

01:06:16.767 --> 01:06:18.401
- and paintings and boats.
- And I work hard.

01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:20.203
He's got four kids at Latin

01:06:20.205 --> 01:06:21.437
- and the Jag.
- Used.

01:06:21.439 --> 01:06:22.705
One exquisite ex-wife.

01:06:22.707 --> 01:06:25.607
That's not exactly
the adjective I'd use.

01:06:26.544 --> 01:06:28.544
You know what? Fuck.
I'm not gonna

01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:30.348
stay around for
the rest of the math lesson.

01:06:31.183 --> 01:06:32.281
I'll see you all at my

01:06:32.283 --> 01:06:33.683
- victory party.
- Where's he going?

01:06:33.718 --> 01:06:35.685
Where you can beg me not to
have the IRS audit any of you.

01:06:35.687 --> 01:06:37.419
- Jack... Come back.
- Yeah, Jack what?

01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:38.989
- What? Come on!
- Oh, come on!

01:06:38.991 --> 01:06:41.189
- You still got my vote.
- Yeah, I won't need it.

01:06:41.191 --> 01:06:42.825
Jack, come back.

01:06:42.827 --> 01:06:43.928
You cocksuckers.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.703
Mm.

01:06:52.604 --> 01:06:53.839
Hi, baby.

01:06:57.908 --> 01:06:58.943
Morning.

01:07:06.618 --> 01:07:08.687
Never thought
I'd marry a white man.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.321
Or a criminal.

01:07:19.365 --> 01:07:21.433
Fucking me won't make it better.

01:07:24.602 --> 01:07:26.669
Don't make me feel
like my only regret

01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:28.573
is having a child with you.

01:07:29.941 --> 01:07:31.242
Maybe you're right.

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:33.375
Maybe you should've had him
with someone else.

01:07:33.377 --> 01:07:34.946
Then he'd still be alive.

01:09:04.335 --> 01:09:05.569
Hello?

01:09:06.371 --> 01:09:07.706
Amanda?

01:09:09.608 --> 01:09:10.676
No.

01:09:12.678 --> 01:09:14.813
It just comes in waves,
you know?

01:09:17.081 --> 01:09:18.584
Sure. Sure.

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.853
Yeah, I can do that.

01:09:21.886 --> 01:09:23.388
I wasn't trying to be rude

01:09:23.587 --> 01:09:26.692
by not turning up to the spa.
I was just scared.

01:09:27.224 --> 01:09:28.593
Maybe.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.560
I don't know.

01:09:30.562 --> 01:09:34.032
A lot of things. Scared, sad.

01:09:34.666 --> 01:09:37.069
What do they say about grief?
How many stages?

01:09:37.536 --> 01:09:39.404
I'm not sure which one I'm in.

01:09:40.938 --> 01:09:42.504
Maybe I was even angry.

01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:43.606
I got the impression from Jimmy

01:09:43.608 --> 01:09:45.341
he wasn't so sure
about this one.

01:09:45.343 --> 01:09:47.011
Thought Harry
was getting sloppy.

01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:49.212
Harry was never sloppy.

01:09:49.214 --> 01:09:52.216
Thirty years of doing
what he did, not one mistake.

01:09:52.783 --> 01:09:54.952
I guess he was human after all.

01:09:59.924 --> 01:10:02.060
So what did you
wanna talk to me about?

01:10:03.228 --> 01:10:05.128
I just wanted to know
how you were

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:06.698
since losing your husband.

01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:12.638
I'm a single parent
of a four-month-old baby boy.

01:10:14.238 --> 01:10:16.040
How are you coping on your own?

01:10:17.309 --> 01:10:18.844
Getting through it.

01:10:19.576 --> 01:10:21.078
What are you gonna do?

01:10:24.049 --> 01:10:26.984
Look for answers,
try to figure it out.

01:10:27.986 --> 01:10:31.990
Well... I hope he left you
enough to start over.

01:10:32.657 --> 01:10:34.493
Maybe go somewhere else?

01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:53.778
Hey.

01:11:15.934 --> 01:11:17.536
That a Super Bowl ring?

01:11:18.102 --> 01:11:19.770
1985 Bears.

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:21.538
You played for the Bears

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.807
when they won the Super Bowl?

01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:24.209
Hey, Asthma.

01:11:24.642 --> 01:11:26.743
Did Bash Babiak
win the Super Bowl?

01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:28.212
Don't believe he did.

01:11:28.647 --> 01:11:31.647
No. It was a birthday
present from Harry.

01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:32.718
Mm.

01:11:33.218 --> 01:11:35.787
I want you to help me
get Harry's notebook.

01:11:36.287 --> 01:11:37.387
I don't have it.

01:11:37.389 --> 01:11:38.890
I know you don't.
She has it.

01:11:39.157 --> 01:11:40.522
Who?

01:11:40.524 --> 01:11:43.127
Veronica.
Mrs. Rawlings. Your boss.

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:45.964
You're gonna agree
to get it for me.

01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:49.533
I don't work for her.
She don't have any money.

01:11:50.134 --> 01:11:53.038
She doesn't have any notebook,
far as I know.

01:11:56.741 --> 01:11:58.674
Give that
motherfucker two piece spicy.

01:11:58.676 --> 01:12:01.343
- Fuck!
- No biscuit!

01:12:03.348 --> 01:12:04.881
Pass rush coming.

01:12:04.883 --> 01:12:07.482
Two guys, stretched out,
landing. Just on the 40...

01:12:08.752 --> 01:12:10.285
Settled, stretching out,
playing brilliantly

01:12:10.287 --> 01:12:11.721
despite that low angle...

01:12:17.094 --> 01:12:20.131
Mrs. Rawlings,
we have an envelope for you.

01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:22.200
There you go.

01:12:38.349 --> 01:12:39.949
Bash? What's going on?

01:12:39.951 --> 01:12:42.384
What's going on
is you have one week.

01:12:54.398 --> 01:12:56.233
I thought we were going out.

01:12:57.935 --> 01:13:00.237
I thought so, too,
and then I saw you.

01:13:00.438 --> 01:13:02.374
I decided
we should try being late.

01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:14.052
Leave them.

01:13:16.955 --> 01:13:18.957
What, are you building
a safe room?

01:13:19.557 --> 01:13:20.625
A what?

01:13:20.892 --> 01:13:23.228
This. It looks like a...

01:13:23.694 --> 01:13:25.661
It looks like a safe room.
A nice one.

01:13:25.663 --> 01:13:27.797
You can tell that
just by looking at the plans?

01:13:27.799 --> 01:13:29.801
- Yeah.
- Can you tell me where it is?

01:13:30.701 --> 01:13:32.837
I know a guy who can find out.

01:13:35.406 --> 01:13:37.109
If you're really asking that.

01:13:52.122 --> 01:13:53.290
Alice?

01:13:55.193 --> 01:13:56.158
How would you feel about

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.095
making this
arrangement exclusive?

01:13:59.363 --> 01:14:01.030
I think I'd like that.

01:14:01.032 --> 01:14:02.034
Yeah?

01:14:29.626 --> 01:14:31.429
Oh, shit! That's my ma.

01:14:32.296 --> 01:14:33.628
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:35.030
- You shitting me?
- No.

01:14:35.032 --> 01:14:37.167
- Oh, fuck.
- Get your clothes on.

01:14:41.406 --> 01:14:43.408
Just a minute. Mom?

01:14:43.774 --> 01:14:45.277
It's Veronica.

01:14:49.913 --> 01:14:51.247
What are you doing here?

01:14:51.249 --> 01:14:52.983
I didn't know where else to go.

01:14:55.286 --> 01:14:56.321
Come in.

01:15:04.895 --> 01:15:06.298
Just sit on the bed.

01:15:09.834 --> 01:15:11.470
I'll just finish
getting dressed.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.776
Your mom, huh?

01:15:31.223 --> 01:15:33.390
Your husband's
been dead a month.

01:15:34.192 --> 01:15:35.861
Why are you being such a bitch?

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.526
You're being a cunt.

01:15:37.528 --> 01:15:38.793
Don't you say that word to me.

01:15:38.795 --> 01:15:40.530
It's appropriate.
You're being a cunt.

01:15:40.532 --> 01:15:41.732
A friend lets a friend know...

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.132
- when she's being a cunt.
- You're not a friend.

01:15:43.134 --> 01:15:44.734
You're just a stupid girl
with nothing in your head.

01:15:44.736 --> 01:15:45.834
I'm not stupid.

01:15:45.836 --> 01:15:47.101
Then why don't you
keep your legs shut?

01:15:47.103 --> 01:15:48.870
- David is gonna help us.
- Help us do what?

01:15:48.872 --> 01:15:50.172
He thinks the blueprints
are a safe room.

01:15:50.174 --> 01:15:51.339
He's gonna find out where it is.

01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:53.674
- You idiot.
- You're a cold, old bitch!

01:15:59.149 --> 01:16:01.286
I'm done being
treated like shit.

01:16:03.153 --> 01:16:04.356
Not again.

01:16:05.223 --> 01:16:06.390
Not by you.

01:16:07.192 --> 01:16:08.460
Not by anyone.

01:16:13.997 --> 01:16:15.567
They killed Bash.

01:16:18.502 --> 01:16:19.537
Who did?

01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:24.408
- The Mannings.
- What? How do you know?

01:16:25.175 --> 01:16:26.310
I know.

01:16:30.682 --> 01:16:32.050
I'm not Harry.

01:16:33.684 --> 01:16:35.618
All this damage, I...

01:16:36.187 --> 01:16:37.753
I can't be responsible
for all of it.

01:16:37.755 --> 01:16:38.988
Why do you have to be?

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:40.892
Because I don't own anything.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.362
Not even
the apartment I live in.

01:16:48.599 --> 01:16:50.067
I have nothing.

01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:17.162
We can't tell Linda about Bash.

01:17:18.529 --> 01:17:19.865
She'll back out.

01:17:22.399 --> 01:17:23.932
You need to find us
a new driver.

01:17:23.934 --> 01:17:24.974
That's not easy.

01:17:25.402 --> 01:17:26.869
Don't you know anyone else?

01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:28.704
No! I'm working on it.

01:17:28.706 --> 01:17:29.905
What have you been
doing all week?

01:17:29.907 --> 01:17:31.006
She's had a rough time.

01:17:31.008 --> 01:17:33.042
Yeah?
They wanna repo my home!

01:17:33.044 --> 01:17:35.311
My bitch of a mother-in-law
wants to take away my kids.

01:17:35.313 --> 01:17:36.579
What's your kids
and mother-in-law

01:17:36.581 --> 01:17:37.581
have to do with me?

01:17:37.648 --> 01:17:39.280
I gave you one job,
and you couldn't even do it,

01:17:39.282 --> 01:17:40.816
so don't tell me how to do mine!

01:17:40.818 --> 01:17:42.717
If we fuck this up

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:46.023
I know what the consequences
of this shit look like.

01:17:46.523 --> 01:17:50.327
Have either of you ever
been to a prison? Once?

01:17:53.363 --> 01:17:54.398
I didn't think so.

01:17:54.965 --> 01:17:56.401
Six days.

01:17:58.068 --> 01:17:59.937
Find a fucking driver!

01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:09.214
I know.

01:18:11.616 --> 01:18:12.616
Veronica.

01:18:12.716 --> 01:18:15.116
- Can I come in?
- Did you call?

01:18:15.118 --> 01:18:17.221
No. Can I ask you
some questions?

01:18:17.921 --> 01:18:19.189
Oh, sure. Of course.

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:21.324
Let me put Albert in his room.

01:18:21.326 --> 01:18:22.958
- Albert? Beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.130
- Can I put my dog down?
- Sure, of course.

01:18:34.973 --> 01:18:37.740
Um, this is actually not
a very good time for me.

01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:39.052
The baby is really fussy today...

01:18:39.076 --> 01:18:40.842
Did Jimmy tell you
about anyone else?

01:18:40.844 --> 01:18:42.279
Someone who could drive a job?

01:18:43.113 --> 01:18:45.381
- Veronica, what are you doing?
- Someone with some skills.

01:18:45.383 --> 01:18:47.251
Maybe the person
who prepped his cars.

01:18:48.218 --> 01:18:50.255
You need to leave this alone.

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:55.360
Sorry, I gotta...
I'll be right back.

01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:13.178
Olivia!

01:20:17.608 --> 01:20:20.211
We should have left sooner,
like you said we would.

01:20:22.947 --> 01:20:24.549
You always want more.

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.598
Your medical examiner
friend open his mouth yet?

01:21:16.133 --> 01:21:17.535
Grab the leg!
Get the leg!

01:21:24.608 --> 01:21:27.211
Not yet.
But he wants his money.

01:21:28.478 --> 01:21:30.780
Even dead bodies cost money
in this economy.

01:21:31.247 --> 01:21:33.348
What about that detective
scumbag, Fuller?

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:35.317
He's just happy that
you'll never show your face

01:21:35.319 --> 01:21:36.418
in Chicago again.

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.323
He's retiring a wealthy man.

01:21:39.490 --> 01:21:41.624
You know, your guys went
a little heavy

01:21:41.626 --> 01:21:42.627
on the accelerants.

01:21:43.326 --> 01:21:44.927
I was lucky to get away
with half of that.

01:21:44.929 --> 01:21:48.165
I want the full amount, Harry.
One million, like we agreed.

01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:51.068
I thought this was about
stopping the Mannings?

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:54.738
Don't think you can fuck me
over like you did your crew.

01:22:00.277 --> 01:22:02.311
Harry! What the fuck?

01:22:02.313 --> 01:22:04.149
Fuck, man! Come on!

01:22:07.818 --> 01:22:10.319
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!

01:22:10.321 --> 01:22:11.589
Harry!

01:22:15.326 --> 01:22:17.362
Harry!
You piece of shit!

01:22:46.156 --> 01:22:47.692
I want that money.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.761
I can get your money,
but I need time.

01:22:52.763 --> 01:22:53.898
Before the election.

01:22:55.599 --> 01:22:56.700
If not...

01:22:57.568 --> 01:22:59.204
you're gonna be alive again.

01:22:59.937 --> 01:23:01.573
In all the worst ways.

01:23:47.318 --> 01:23:49.721
You hungry?

01:24:14.578 --> 01:24:16.945
I told you, after
school I was taking the car,

01:24:16.947 --> 01:24:18.549
and you didn't say anything.

01:24:19.283 --> 01:24:22.786
Mom heard me. Dad,
Dad, ask her. Mom heard me.

01:24:23.687 --> 01:24:26.457
How is it my fault
if you left it in the car?

01:24:31.828 --> 01:24:33.398
How would I even...

01:24:35.198 --> 01:24:36.966
Can I just bring it
home to you later?

01:24:37.434 --> 01:24:39.467
Dad, I'm really about
to miss, like, half the game

01:24:39.469 --> 01:24:40.971
if I have to turn around now.

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.507
I'm not saying
it's more important

01:24:45.509 --> 01:24:46.910
than your anniversary.

01:24:47.277 --> 01:24:49.413
I'm already on my way back
right now, Dad.

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:52.579
I'll be there in, like,
15 minutes or something.

01:24:52.581 --> 01:24:55.319
Oh, fuck!

01:24:56.452 --> 01:24:58.187
Dad, Dad, Dad, I...

01:24:58.856 --> 01:25:00.825
Dad, I just got pulled over now.

01:25:04.527 --> 01:25:06.895
- Dad, I gotta go.
- Get out of the car. Keep your

01:25:06.897 --> 01:25:09.064
- hands where I can see them.
- I gotta go deal with this.

01:25:09.066 --> 01:25:10.198
Marcus!

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.036
- Marcus! Marcus!
- Oh, shit.

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:13.638
Hands where I can see them!

01:25:14.904 --> 01:25:17.341
Marcus! Marcus!

01:25:18.309 --> 01:25:19.577
Marcus!

01:26:10.961 --> 01:26:12.496
Look what I found.

01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:15.865
So I have to go to Shanghai
for a few nights.

01:26:15.867 --> 01:26:18.102
There's a site we're
thinking about developing.

01:26:18.469 --> 01:26:19.670
You wanna come?

01:26:21.839 --> 01:26:22.872
To Shanghai?

01:26:23.206 --> 01:26:24.474
You ever been?

01:26:24.841 --> 01:26:25.975
Uh, no.

01:26:26.276 --> 01:26:27.612
No. When?

01:26:27.944 --> 01:26:28.979
Tomorrow.

01:26:29.779 --> 01:26:30.848
I can't.

01:26:31.849 --> 01:26:32.849
You can't?

01:26:33.617 --> 01:26:34.883
I got commitments here.

01:26:34.885 --> 01:26:37.922
I can't just drop everything
and fly to Shanghai.

01:26:38.322 --> 01:26:39.924
My life's different than yours.

01:26:40.491 --> 01:26:42.022
It seems to me if you can ask me

01:26:42.024 --> 01:26:44.428
to get the address
off a permit, which I did,

01:26:44.627 --> 01:26:46.794
then I can certainly ask you
to ditch your commitments

01:26:46.796 --> 01:26:49.200
and fly with me to Shanghai
for a few days.

01:26:50.567 --> 01:26:52.970
Or do overseas adventures
cost more?

01:26:54.772 --> 01:26:56.607
Is everything
just a transaction?

01:26:57.541 --> 01:26:58.774
They brought us these drinks,

01:26:58.776 --> 01:27:00.109
next they're gonna
bring us the bill.

01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:02.647
It's the way the world works,
as far as I'm concerned.

01:27:07.017 --> 01:27:08.085
Sorry.

01:27:12.523 --> 01:27:13.925
Next time.

01:27:19.964 --> 01:27:21.131
Is that the one?

01:27:22.299 --> 01:27:23.501
Yep.

01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:42.883
- Hey, Xavy.
- Hi.

01:27:42.885 --> 01:27:45.089
- Thank God.
- Smells good.

01:27:45.356 --> 01:27:46.887
It's almost done. You hungry?

01:27:46.889 --> 01:27:47.821
Yeah.

01:27:47.823 --> 01:27:49.857
Mom, can I set
the table for Belle?

01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:50.894
Yes.

01:27:52.429 --> 01:27:53.796
You don't have to run, you know.

01:27:53.798 --> 01:27:55.998
Don't worry. I'd rather
be here on your dime

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.603
than sitting on that damn bus,
not making any money.

01:28:03.706 --> 01:28:05.876
Belle, can you drive?

01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:07.810
Why?

01:28:10.548 --> 01:28:11.749
Solved our problem.

01:28:12.616 --> 01:28:14.682
- What's this?
- This is Belle.

01:28:14.684 --> 01:28:17.622
She's fast, she's smart,
and she can drive.

01:28:19.223 --> 01:28:20.454
Come on. We can't do this,

01:28:20.456 --> 01:28:21.957
the three of us.
We need a driver.

01:28:21.959 --> 01:28:23.859
This is not your place.
Please ask her to leave.

01:28:23.861 --> 01:28:25.393
I'm standing here.
You can talk to me.

01:28:25.395 --> 01:28:26.962
- I don't know you.
- You don't have to.

01:28:26.964 --> 01:28:28.430
I'm happy to leave right now.

01:28:28.432 --> 01:28:30.100
Wait. We need a driver.

01:28:38.843 --> 01:28:40.609
You girls happy
to split your cut?

01:28:40.611 --> 01:28:42.013
Split our cut?

01:28:42.545 --> 01:28:43.981
It's equal or nothing.

01:28:45.549 --> 01:28:46.713
You vouch for her?

01:28:46.715 --> 01:28:48.251
I don't require a vouch.

01:28:49.319 --> 01:28:51.755
- We're gonna need another gun.
- I got my own.

01:28:52.857 --> 01:28:54.792
You need to watch
how you talk to me.

01:28:56.859 --> 01:28:59.796
If you're in, we need
to get you started right away.

01:29:53.983 --> 01:29:55.151
Expecting someone?

01:29:55.385 --> 01:29:57.585
You never can be
too sure in this neighborhood.

01:29:57.755 --> 01:30:00.724
My gosh, how many security
guards do you have?

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:02.893
Oh, just the one.

01:30:05.129 --> 01:30:06.997
The neighborhood's
really changing.

01:30:08.099 --> 01:30:09.432
Yes, it is.

01:30:09.698 --> 01:30:11.298
- Would you mind waiting here?
- No.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.267
Mr. Mulligan
should be free momentarily.

01:30:13.269 --> 01:30:14.304
He's in a meeting.

01:30:54.077 --> 01:30:56.913
We appreciate
your support. Bye-bye.

01:31:07.491 --> 01:31:09.126
Excuse me, can I help you?

01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:11.726
I was just looking
for the bathroom,

01:31:11.728 --> 01:31:13.427
and I was just
admiring this map.

01:31:13.429 --> 01:31:14.430
Sure. You are?

01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:16.664
I have a meeting
with Jack Mulligan.

01:31:16.666 --> 01:31:18.333
Ma'am, there's
a restroom downstairs.

01:31:18.335 --> 01:31:19.804
I can show you the way.

01:31:46.663 --> 01:31:48.274
You got a weak bladder
or something?

01:31:48.298 --> 01:31:50.131
My wife told me I need to drink

01:31:50.133 --> 01:31:52.001
eight glasses of water a day.
I guess...

01:31:58.843 --> 01:31:59.941
I'll tell you exactly why

01:31:59.943 --> 01:32:01.612
I fired your campaign manager.

01:32:01.978 --> 01:32:03.712
He told me we would get
the endorsement of Wheeler

01:32:03.714 --> 01:32:06.216
and now the good reverend has
decided to sit this one out.

01:32:06.884 --> 01:32:08.216
He doesn't get to do that.

01:32:08.218 --> 01:32:10.821
Oh.
Let me get this straight.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.022
You fire Hillsman.

01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:16.559
He's been working with
our family for 30 years.

01:32:16.926 --> 01:32:18.728
So you just put a bullet in him.

01:32:19.263 --> 01:32:23.499
When the polls drop to, what,
three percent? Why? Why?

01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:25.999
I got a new guy coming on.
Black guy. British.

01:32:26.001 --> 01:32:28.602
Black guy? Oh, really?
A black guy.

01:32:28.604 --> 01:32:29.736
Gavin Cunningham.

01:32:29.738 --> 01:32:31.308
- What?
- Gavin Cunningham.

01:32:31.907 --> 01:32:33.275
Fuck me and fuck him!

01:32:33.277 --> 01:32:36.645
Fuck you and fuck the fucking
horse you came in on!

01:32:36.647 --> 01:32:38.480
You fucking asshole!

01:32:38.482 --> 01:32:40.615
What a fucking asshole you are!

01:32:40.617 --> 01:32:42.419
Talk about loyalty. Hey!

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.652
Maybe I'll call the mayor
and tell him

01:32:44.654 --> 01:32:46.053
we gotta have
this election tomorrow,

01:32:46.055 --> 01:32:48.022
- before things get any worse.
- You won't call the mayor.

01:32:48.024 --> 01:32:49.824
I will take care of Manning
at the debate,

01:32:49.826 --> 01:32:51.058
and that will be the end of it.

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.460
Might I add,
running in your shadow

01:32:52.462 --> 01:32:53.673
would be a hell of a lot easier

01:32:53.697 --> 01:32:56.164
if there weren't piles of shit
scattered everywhere I walk!

01:32:56.166 --> 01:32:59.066
Keep your fucking mouth shut,
or I'll fucking whip your ass!

01:32:59.068 --> 01:33:00.101
Today!

01:33:00.103 --> 01:33:02.473
I can still do it. Believe me.

01:33:03.139 --> 01:33:04.140
Okay?

01:33:06.242 --> 01:33:07.743
JFK, huh?

01:33:08.045 --> 01:33:09.578
You think you're gonna
make things better.

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.860
They're not gonna be any better.

01:33:11.014 --> 01:33:14.417
You think you're gonna change
things? Change them to what?

01:33:14.885 --> 01:33:16.453
You're not gonna
change anything!

01:33:17.121 --> 01:33:19.456
They'll never change under you.

01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:21.923
The only thing that matters

01:33:21.925 --> 01:33:23.994
is that we survive.
That's all.

01:33:24.894 --> 01:33:26.860
Look around you.
It's like Custer's Last Stand.

01:33:26.862 --> 01:33:28.298
It's kill or be killed.

01:33:30.032 --> 01:33:31.500
Now, listen to me, son.

01:33:32.068 --> 01:33:34.235
Listen, we made this city.

01:33:34.237 --> 01:33:35.971
We're not having it
taken away from us

01:33:35.973 --> 01:33:38.209
by people
who come here illegally...

01:33:39.242 --> 01:33:41.212
or by people who can't stop,
you know...

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.248
making babies.

01:33:44.615 --> 01:33:46.483
That means staying in power...

01:33:46.983 --> 01:33:49.286
at all costs. You got that?

01:33:49.685 --> 01:33:50.685
Yeah?

01:33:50.987 --> 01:33:52.523
You listen to me, Father.

01:33:54.258 --> 01:33:57.227
I'm looking forward to the day
when all this bullshit is over

01:33:57.861 --> 01:34:00.197
and I don't have to talk
to people like you.

01:34:05.335 --> 01:34:06.537
Because...

01:34:10.307 --> 01:34:12.242
Because you won't be
here anymore.

01:34:19.616 --> 01:34:20.649
My son.

01:34:23.086 --> 01:34:24.087
Boy.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.229
- You finished?
- Yeah.

01:34:33.697 --> 01:34:34.697
Okay.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:38.001
Now, hear me.

01:34:39.969 --> 01:34:42.371
Tell your redheaded
paperweight here...

01:34:42.939 --> 01:34:46.242
to call Hillsman,
and hire him back.

01:34:46.843 --> 01:34:48.075
Okay?

01:34:48.077 --> 01:34:52.146
He's gonna make this
Gavin whatever, whoever,

01:34:52.148 --> 01:34:54.418
your debate prep consultant.

01:34:59.255 --> 01:35:02.291
You need to pick up your toys,
put them back in the box.

01:35:02.826 --> 01:35:07.262
When you're done, we will
continue this conversation.

01:35:07.264 --> 01:35:08.432
Eh?

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.467
Get the door.

01:35:15.538 --> 01:35:16.706
My jacket.

01:35:21.978 --> 01:35:24.110
- Who are you?
- I'm Veronica Rawlings.

01:35:24.112 --> 01:35:25.112
We met a long time ago,

01:35:25.282 --> 01:35:27.351
when I was lobbying
for the teachers' union.

01:35:28.684 --> 01:35:32.152
I hope you can teach my son
better than I did.

01:35:32.154 --> 01:35:34.387
Mrs. Rawlings, I don't think
you're on my schedule today.

01:35:34.389 --> 01:35:36.024
I'm not sure
I have the time to sit.

01:35:36.026 --> 01:35:38.191
You do. You absolutely do.

01:35:38.193 --> 01:35:40.496
She's from the teachers'
union. All right?

01:35:41.298 --> 01:35:43.597
Yeah, let's go.
We're leaving. Okay.

01:35:43.599 --> 01:35:44.766
Sorry to interrupt,

01:35:44.768 --> 01:35:45.888
- Mr. Mulligan.
- Yeah?

01:35:46.202 --> 01:35:48.070
Taking the car to the garage.
I'll be back in a few hours.

01:35:48.072 --> 01:35:50.307
Sure, John. Just see
Siobhan before you leave.

01:35:50.874 --> 01:35:52.509
Mrs. Rawlings, please come in.

01:36:04.321 --> 01:36:05.455
Hmm.

01:36:05.688 --> 01:36:06.722
I know that guy.

01:36:06.923 --> 01:36:08.325
Seen him at the salon.

01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:15.665
When was the last
time you saw my husband?

01:36:16.765 --> 01:36:18.501
Before he died?

01:36:19.068 --> 01:36:20.770
It was a while.
I can't remember.

01:36:21.438 --> 01:36:22.606
Why do you ask?

01:36:24.174 --> 01:36:26.276
Jamal Manning threatened me.

01:36:27.876 --> 01:36:29.745
He says Harry stole from him,

01:36:29.946 --> 01:36:31.548
and he presented me
with the bill.

01:36:32.916 --> 01:36:34.147
He wants his money.

01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:35.618
I'm not sure I follow.

01:36:37.821 --> 01:36:39.052
From what I understand,

01:36:39.054 --> 01:36:41.124
we both have
a Jamal Manning problem.

01:36:42.959 --> 01:36:44.327
You don't...

01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:49.099
You don't live in my ward,
Mrs. Rawlings.

01:36:49.799 --> 01:36:51.399
But if you're aware of a crime,

01:36:51.401 --> 01:36:52.633
you should really
go to the police.

01:36:52.635 --> 01:36:55.505
Mr. Mulligan, you said
whenever I needed help.

01:36:55.705 --> 01:36:58.807
Now, your family's been involved
in Harry's life for many years.

01:36:58.809 --> 01:36:59.975
When I say help...

01:36:59.977 --> 01:37:02.345
- I mean help.
- I understand, but...

01:37:03.612 --> 01:37:04.947
I'm not my father.

01:37:05.916 --> 01:37:08.619
As you can see, the years
have taken a toll on him...

01:37:09.085 --> 01:37:11.387
and I do not want to go down
that same road.

01:37:12.956 --> 01:37:14.856
So with much
admiration and respect

01:37:14.858 --> 01:37:18.262
for your late husband
and yourself, of course...

01:37:19.395 --> 01:37:20.798
I don't see what I can do.

01:37:23.633 --> 01:37:25.736
What I've learned
from men like my father...

01:37:26.469 --> 01:37:27.538
and Harry...

01:37:28.336 --> 01:37:30.174
is that you reap what you sow.

01:37:34.678 --> 01:37:36.113
Let's hope so.

01:37:50.294 --> 01:37:52.459
That guy who was here,
in the suit, who is he?

01:37:52.461 --> 01:37:54.195
I told you, I don't want you
to get involved.

01:37:54.197 --> 01:37:55.495
What do you mean?

01:37:55.497 --> 01:37:56.899
He works for someone.

01:37:57.134 --> 01:37:58.401
So who really owns this salon?

01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.801
How is that
any of your business?

01:37:59.803 --> 01:38:01.535
What doesn't bother you
doesn't trouble you.

01:38:01.537 --> 01:38:03.339
Mm-hmm.
- Jack Mulligan?

01:38:09.278 --> 01:38:10.647
He empowered me.

01:38:11.081 --> 01:38:13.780
I am a female minority
business owner.

01:38:13.782 --> 01:38:16.083
But the powers that be
take a very healthy cut.

01:38:16.085 --> 01:38:17.217
So why do you stand for it?

01:38:17.219 --> 01:38:19.520
Where exactly would you
like me to stand?

01:38:19.522 --> 01:38:20.955
I needed money
to start a business,

01:38:20.957 --> 01:38:22.490
he gave it to me,
and now I owe him.

01:38:22.492 --> 01:38:24.792
No bank was gonna give me
any money. He did.

01:38:24.794 --> 01:38:26.727
All I wanted to do was
have a business of my own

01:38:26.729 --> 01:38:28.396
and this way I'm allowed
to think I have one.

01:38:28.398 --> 01:38:30.343
Does that sound right to you?
Because it doesn't sound right

01:38:30.367 --> 01:38:31.600
- to me.
- You got a customer

01:38:31.602 --> 01:38:32.603
right over there.

01:38:44.514 --> 01:38:46.079
Two of the three
cameras at the back

01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:47.214
are covered by the construction.

01:38:47.216 --> 01:38:48.216
Mm-hmm.

01:38:48.518 --> 01:38:50.016
And what about
the codes for the safe room?

01:38:50.018 --> 01:38:51.253
Veronica's on it.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.286
Why isn't she here?
Why are we

01:38:53.288 --> 01:38:54.622
- doing this by ourselves?
- I don't know.

01:38:54.624 --> 01:38:56.593
Why are we doing this anyway?

01:38:56.992 --> 01:38:58.528
Wait, who's watching your kids?

01:38:59.862 --> 01:39:00.896
My mom.

01:39:01.264 --> 01:39:02.430
So while you were
sitting her kids,

01:39:02.432 --> 01:39:03.664
your mom was
watching your daughter?

01:39:03.666 --> 01:39:05.502
I work two jobs.
What do you do for money?

01:39:06.569 --> 01:39:07.904
I had Florek.

01:39:11.241 --> 01:39:12.475
I had a business.

01:39:12.675 --> 01:39:14.244
Did you know what they did?

01:39:14.777 --> 01:39:16.212
I thought I did.

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.715
If I asked, he'd hit me.

01:39:20.283 --> 01:39:22.518
After a job, though,
he was nice.

01:39:25.721 --> 01:39:28.455
What about Veronica?
You think she knew?

01:39:28.457 --> 01:39:30.826
I bet she knew everything.

01:39:31.126 --> 01:39:33.361
"You girls
happy to split your cut?"

01:39:33.595 --> 01:39:36.297
What about this? "You
vouch for her?"

01:39:36.299 --> 01:39:37.464
She'd be a lot nicer if she

01:39:37.466 --> 01:39:39.299
just took that stick
out of her ass.

01:39:39.301 --> 01:39:41.337
You know why
we need a new driver?

01:39:42.205 --> 01:39:43.807
The last one was killed.

01:39:48.210 --> 01:39:49.879
So if you're not serious...

01:40:06.295 --> 01:40:08.365
If this whole thing
goes wrong...

01:40:08.865 --> 01:40:10.196
I just want my kids to know

01:40:10.198 --> 01:40:11.835
that I didn't sit there
and take it.

01:40:12.868 --> 01:40:14.237
I did something.

01:40:21.877 --> 01:40:23.979
Our go date is in three days.

01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.949
The night of the debate.

01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:28.548
Now, all of our work
is worth nothing

01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:30.553
if we don't move
this money and fast.

01:40:30.819 --> 01:40:33.119
The notebook says
five million dollars.

01:40:33.121 --> 01:40:34.789
That's exactly
the amount of money

01:40:34.791 --> 01:40:37.326
Mulligan was accused of taking
in commission kickbacks.

01:40:37.792 --> 01:40:39.793
So over here we have
two million dollars.

01:40:39.795 --> 01:40:40.795
Twenty Tupperware boxes.

01:40:40.863 --> 01:40:43.998
Each box has 100,000 dollars
in 100-dollar bills.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.401
It weighs 44 pounds.

01:40:45.701 --> 01:40:47.868
Now, over here we have
two million dollars.

01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:49.036
Forty Tupperware boxes.

01:40:49.038 --> 01:40:52.073
Each box has 50,000 dollars
in 50-dollar bills.

01:40:52.075 --> 01:40:53.374
It weighs 88 pounds.

01:40:53.376 --> 01:40:54.674
I feel like I'm in school.

01:40:54.676 --> 01:40:56.476
- Tell me about it.
- Okay, Linda.

01:40:56.478 --> 01:40:57.911
That bag has the weight of

01:40:57.913 --> 01:40:59.747
two million dollars
in hundred-dollar bills.

01:40:59.749 --> 01:41:00.749
Put it on.

01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:08.191
All right.

01:41:08.524 --> 01:41:10.359
Run to the back
of that van and back.

01:41:14.697 --> 01:41:17.499
This is nothing.
All that for this?

01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:19.167
- Now, Belle...
- That was easy.

01:41:19.169 --> 01:41:20.170
Put that on.

01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:22.236
Watch you back.
Bend your knees.

01:41:22.238 --> 01:41:24.174
Okay, run to the back
of the van and back.

01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:27.173
Come on! Come on!

01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:29.709
It's not funny now, is it?

01:41:29.711 --> 01:41:31.212
And it won't be
if we get caught.

01:41:31.214 --> 01:41:34.818
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on, run!

01:41:35.285 --> 01:41:37.120
Get this thing off of me.

01:41:37.487 --> 01:41:39.820
Now, that bag had double
the weight of before.

01:41:39.822 --> 01:41:41.088
Why the fuck would you do that?

01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:43.123
Because I had to think
of the best-case scenario

01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:44.357
and the worst-case scenario.

01:41:44.359 --> 01:41:46.161
We gotta move fast.

01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:49.229
We gotta start thinking
like professionals.

01:41:49.231 --> 01:41:50.867
We're in business together.

01:41:51.501 --> 01:41:53.303
There's not gonna be
some cozy reunion.

01:41:53.736 --> 01:41:56.038
After this job, we're done.

01:41:57.541 --> 01:42:00.210
We have three days to look
and move like a team of men.

01:42:00.876 --> 01:42:04.080
The best thing we have going
for us is being who we are.

01:42:04.613 --> 01:42:05.613
Why?

01:42:06.182 --> 01:42:09.452
Because no one thinks we have
the balls to pull this off.

01:42:21.231 --> 01:42:22.698
Can I ask you a question?

01:42:23.066 --> 01:42:25.736
As long as I can answer it
and still get to my meeting.

01:42:26.536 --> 01:42:28.605
How come we
never go to your place?

01:42:29.339 --> 01:42:30.707
My place?

01:42:31.407 --> 01:42:32.606
That's your question?

01:42:32.608 --> 01:42:34.109
I'd like to see how you live.

01:42:34.477 --> 01:42:36.546
I could cook you dinner.
We could watch some TV.

01:42:37.412 --> 01:42:39.914
Look, I really,
really like you, Alice.

01:42:39.916 --> 01:42:41.882
I don't think I've ever been
this happy with a woman.

01:42:41.884 --> 01:42:44.587
I truly do care about you.
I really do.

01:42:45.188 --> 01:42:46.690
But I'm not your husband.

01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:49.725
I know you're not.

01:42:54.162 --> 01:42:57.698
Look, this is an arrangement,
okay? It's not a marriage.

01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:01.201
I pay for things, and outta
that, you get a nice life.

01:43:01.203 --> 01:43:03.106
I don't need you
to have a nice life.

01:43:04.174 --> 01:43:05.705
Look, if I ended things
right now,

01:43:05.707 --> 01:43:07.007
what would you do for money?

01:43:07.009 --> 01:43:08.011
Excuse me?

01:43:08.611 --> 01:43:10.476
My money, the way I live.

01:43:10.478 --> 01:43:11.857
I'm offering you
a nice life, Alice.

01:43:11.881 --> 01:43:14.984
You say "a life" like it's yours
to offer. But it's mine.

01:43:16.018 --> 01:43:18.921
It's mine to be ashamed of
or be proud of.

01:43:19.322 --> 01:43:21.290
Mine to fuck up or make good.
It's mine.

01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:23.626
I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

01:43:24.493 --> 01:43:25.862
I have to go.

01:43:28.264 --> 01:43:29.699
Can I drop you somewhere?

01:43:32.201 --> 01:43:33.569
I'll get where I need to go.

01:43:56.358 --> 01:43:57.891
It's over.
It was a mistake.

01:43:57.893 --> 01:43:59.459
I know the codes
change every day.

01:43:59.461 --> 01:44:00.794
I need those codes, Ken.

01:44:00.796 --> 01:44:02.932
I thought I was off the hook
now Harry's dead.

01:44:03.633 --> 01:44:05.833
It'll be the third time
my alarm systems get hit.

01:44:05.835 --> 01:44:07.002
People are asking questions.

01:44:07.202 --> 01:44:08.004
You should have thought twice

01:44:08.203 --> 01:44:09.704
before cheating
on your wife with your niece.

01:44:09.706 --> 01:44:10.805
You made a choice.

01:44:10.807 --> 01:44:12.039
Now, I'll go wait
at the gas station.

01:44:12.041 --> 01:44:13.775
If you drive away,
I know you're out.

01:44:13.777 --> 01:44:16.179
If you come to me
with the codes...

01:44:17.313 --> 01:44:18.712
maybe you have a future.

01:44:18.714 --> 01:44:21.551
Please, I'm begging you
as a human being.

01:44:21.984 --> 01:44:24.587
Please! I can't!

01:44:26.354 --> 01:44:27.624
Please!

01:44:35.932 --> 01:44:38.031
I'd like two return tickets.

01:44:55.951 --> 01:44:58.020
The polls say you're gonna win.

01:44:58.688 --> 01:45:01.658
So before you come out swingin'
at the debate tonight...

01:45:03.826 --> 01:45:06.629
What if I stop spending
money on advertising?

01:45:07.964 --> 01:45:10.834
You know, level the playing
field, so to speak.

01:45:11.733 --> 01:45:13.534
I stop making appearances,

01:45:13.536 --> 01:45:15.705
scale back my
"get out the vote" program.

01:45:16.372 --> 01:45:17.607
Make some calls.

01:45:19.608 --> 01:45:20.943
Jamal Manning...

01:45:21.745 --> 01:45:25.549
the first African American
alderman of the 18th ward.

01:45:27.883 --> 01:45:29.650
And I'd be there to advise you,

01:45:29.652 --> 01:45:31.585
you know,
on every important matter.

01:45:31.587 --> 01:45:32.887
Behind the scenes, of course.

01:45:32.889 --> 01:45:34.724
As far as everyone else
is concerned...

01:45:35.524 --> 01:45:36.792
Jamal...

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:38.894
you the man.

01:45:44.666 --> 01:45:46.602
Think about it.

01:45:51.206 --> 01:45:52.841
Not offering you charity.

01:45:53.675 --> 01:45:55.178
I'm offering you power.

01:45:55.711 --> 01:45:56.912
On whose terms?

01:45:58.447 --> 01:45:59.816
You decide.

01:46:02.484 --> 01:46:03.752
See you at the debate.

01:46:06.054 --> 01:46:08.258
Oh, and send my best
to the Reverend Wheeler.

01:47:19.395 --> 01:47:20.763
Everybody ready?

01:47:21.296 --> 01:47:22.765
You got the codes?

01:47:27.702 --> 01:47:29.205
Something goes wrong...

01:47:31.439 --> 01:47:32.841
you're all on your own.

01:47:34.277 --> 01:47:35.879
I'm gonna go get ready.

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.221
Each candidate has

01:47:47.223 --> 01:47:48.856
three minutes to give
an opening statement.

01:47:48.858 --> 01:47:51.225
Mr. Mulligan, you're up first.

01:47:52.527 --> 01:47:53.862
You all know me.

01:47:54.096 --> 01:47:56.633
I'm a proud
sixth generation Chicagoan.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.165
We laugh louder, we work harder,

01:47:59.167 --> 01:48:01.036
we sleep to the rattle
of the "L" train.

01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:08.109
Hey!

01:48:08.344 --> 01:48:09.813
- Hey!
- Go.

01:48:27.263 --> 01:48:28.430
Let's go.

01:49:29.157 --> 01:49:31.460
Put your
fuckin' hands in the air.

01:49:33.062 --> 01:49:36.265
Hurry up.
Don't even think about it.

01:49:36.666 --> 01:49:37.967
Get down!

01:49:38.201 --> 01:49:39.566
Get down!

01:49:40.836 --> 01:49:42.580
Take his gun! Take his gun!

01:50:40.828 --> 01:50:41.962
How do you know

01:50:41.964 --> 01:50:43.164
she's not gonna call the cops?

01:50:43.166 --> 01:50:45.001
She's not that stupid.

01:50:55.745 --> 01:50:56.944
What the fuck?

01:50:56.946 --> 01:50:58.448
What the fuck is wrong?

01:50:59.549 --> 01:51:00.780
Shit.

01:51:00.782 --> 01:51:02.151
Hang on.

01:51:02.518 --> 01:51:03.987
It's upside down.

01:51:10.693 --> 01:51:12.161
Come on.

01:51:24.206 --> 01:51:27.610
Hey, I got the hundreds
right over here.

01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:29.512
Come on.

01:51:32.281 --> 01:51:33.646
How much time do we have?

01:51:33.648 --> 01:51:35.317
Just get it done.

01:52:09.385 --> 01:52:12.088
Let's go. Let's go.

01:52:13.389 --> 01:52:14.389
Hands in the air!

01:52:15.057 --> 01:52:17.259
Drop your weapons!
Hands in the air!

01:52:17.593 --> 01:52:20.662
What, are you takin' my money?
Who the fuck are you?

01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:23.131
You're...

01:52:33.008 --> 01:52:34.676
Let me have the gun.

01:52:37.846 --> 01:52:39.615
Get him off me.

01:52:40.249 --> 01:52:42.151
Get him the fuck off me.

01:52:43.786 --> 01:52:45.455
It's your shoulder.

01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:50.393
Here we go. Here we go.

01:53:04.038 --> 01:53:05.375
Go!

01:53:05.808 --> 01:53:07.010
Go!

01:53:22.157 --> 01:53:24.160
But why do we have to?

01:53:24.527 --> 01:53:29.628
Chicago is a city in free fall.
Money, greed, avarice.

01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:33.499
Fat cats in city hall
getting fatter on our meals.

01:53:33.501 --> 01:53:34.601
Yeah.

01:53:34.603 --> 01:53:38.138
We, the people,
are not people to them.

01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:41.874
We are a mass of ugly need
they don't want to see.

01:53:41.876 --> 01:53:44.410
Let us have a chance at life.

01:53:44.412 --> 01:53:46.113
Not just to exist, but to live.

01:53:46.115 --> 01:53:48.015
Get him, bro. You call
that motherfucker out!

01:53:48.017 --> 01:53:50.618
Let us live!

01:54:06.635 --> 01:54:08.271
Okay.

01:54:09.804 --> 01:54:11.673
Pass it on! Pass it on!

01:54:22.084 --> 01:54:23.318
Go!

01:54:30.192 --> 01:54:32.391
- How's she doin'?
- She's losing blood.

01:54:32.393 --> 01:54:34.328
You gotta stay awake.

01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:35.829
You gotta keep her conscious.

01:54:35.831 --> 01:54:36.797
Stay up. Listen.

01:54:36.799 --> 01:54:38.332
- Shit. All right.
- I don't know

01:54:38.334 --> 01:54:39.999
- if I should put pressure.
- Okay, you're okay.

01:54:40.001 --> 01:54:41.235
- Oh, my God.
- Where is it?

01:54:41.237 --> 01:54:42.436
She's bleeding
all over the place.

01:54:42.438 --> 01:54:43.969
- You're okay.
- You need to stay awake.

01:54:43.971 --> 01:54:45.331
Come on, Alice.
You're okay.

01:54:45.808 --> 01:54:49.045
You guys take off.
I'm gonna stay with her.

01:54:49.478 --> 01:54:51.681
Almost there.

01:55:00.421 --> 01:55:02.622
No. No, no, no. No, no.

01:55:02.624 --> 01:55:03.792
Help!

01:55:04.559 --> 01:55:05.559
Help!

01:55:06.094 --> 01:55:08.531
She's been shot.
It's a drive-by.

01:55:09.130 --> 01:55:10.930
She lost a lot of blood.

01:55:10.932 --> 01:55:12.367
What's your name?

01:55:12.867 --> 01:55:14.000
What's your name, ma'am?

01:55:14.002 --> 01:55:16.572
Her name's Jennifer.

01:56:50.832 --> 01:56:51.832
Yeah.

01:56:57.139 --> 01:56:58.774
It was meant to be simple.

01:57:03.711 --> 01:57:06.946
Why couldn't you just
sell the book to Jamal

01:57:06.948 --> 01:57:08.347
and leave it at that, Ronnie?

01:57:08.349 --> 01:57:09.749
You're not supposed to be here.

01:57:09.751 --> 01:57:12.787
You left me alone,
you evil bastard.

01:57:13.255 --> 01:57:14.588
Wanted to start a new life

01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:18.357
with your new son,
your new white, happy family.

01:57:18.359 --> 01:57:20.496
I couldn't save him, Ronnie!

01:57:21.063 --> 01:57:22.832
I couldn't save us!

01:57:25.201 --> 01:57:28.037
I had to save me!
Me!

01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:30.006
You're a fucking coward!

01:57:33.843 --> 01:57:35.411
I need that money, Ronnie.

01:57:43.484 --> 01:57:44.985
I need the money.

01:59:58.085 --> 01:59:59.584
Muted celebrations

01:59:59.586 --> 02:00:00.786
in the Mulligan camp

02:00:00.788 --> 02:00:03.425
as Tuesday's
election results sink in.

02:00:03.692 --> 02:00:05.725
In a late rally,
there was a resounding

02:00:05.727 --> 02:00:07.561
victory for Jack Mulligan,

02:00:07.563 --> 02:00:09.796
seen as a sympathy vote
following the murder

02:00:09.798 --> 02:00:11.530
of Alderman Tom Mulligan.

02:00:11.532 --> 02:00:13.400
Reverend John Wheeler
was outside

02:00:13.402 --> 02:00:15.034
the Mulligan residence
this morning

02:00:15.036 --> 02:00:16.337
to talk to reporters.

02:00:16.904 --> 02:00:18.271
Brothers and sisters,

02:00:18.273 --> 02:00:21.909
we ask that you keep
Jack Mulligan in your prayers

02:00:21.911 --> 02:00:24.843
as he tries to find
the strength, with God's help,

02:00:24.845 --> 02:00:26.378
to begin his term of office

02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:28.414
and to continue
the program of change

02:00:28.416 --> 02:00:30.150
initiated by his beloved father.

02:00:30.152 --> 02:00:32.118
I know you remember
all the good work

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:34.052
the Mulligans have done
for this community.

02:00:34.054 --> 02:00:37.223
So we hope that
you will join us Sunday.

02:00:37.225 --> 02:00:39.092
We will be holding a service
for Tom Mulligan

02:00:39.094 --> 02:00:42.898
to pay our respects to this
great servant of our ward.

02:00:43.398 --> 02:00:45.231
Mommy, can we go now?

02:00:45.233 --> 02:00:46.535
Okay.

02:00:51.372 --> 02:00:53.707
Come on, open!
Come on! Come on!

02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:55.508
Come on, open it!

02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:56.945
Yeah!

02:00:57.345 --> 02:00:58.946
Come on.

02:00:59.348 --> 02:01:02.281
Come on.
You're not getting it.

02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:07.520
No! No!

02:01:07.522 --> 02:01:09.158
I'm gonna get you!

02:01:13.027 --> 02:01:14.896
Stop!

02:01:16.197 --> 02:01:17.797
What are you doing?

02:01:17.799 --> 02:01:19.633
We're bubble fighting.

02:01:19.635 --> 02:01:20.736
Yeah!

02:01:33.447 --> 02:01:34.847
- Hi.
- Just one?

02:01:34.849 --> 02:01:36.051
Uh, two.

02:01:39.353 --> 02:01:41.655
- This okay?
- Great, thanks.

02:01:42.090 --> 02:01:43.588
Can I get you
something to drink?

02:01:43.590 --> 02:01:45.126
Some coffee, please.

02:01:58.974 --> 02:02:00.705
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

02:02:00.707 --> 02:02:02.775
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

02:02:02.777 --> 02:02:05.946
It is crazy out there.
Driving like crazy people.

02:02:06.447 --> 02:02:09.015
You beat me, of course,
as always. I'm always late.

02:02:09.017 --> 02:02:10.816
I'm so sorry. Did I tell you
about my neighbors?

02:02:10.818 --> 02:02:12.317
They're already putting out
their lawn chairs

02:02:12.319 --> 02:02:13.485
and the kitchen chairs...

02:02:13.487 --> 02:02:14.588
Thank you so much.

02:02:14.856 --> 02:02:16.856
In preparation for
the winter, and it's like...

02:02:16.858 --> 02:02:20.895
"Come on, you guys.
The season is just starting."

02:02:29.638 --> 02:02:31.040
Are you okay?

02:02:31.506 --> 02:02:32.741
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

02:02:32.974 --> 02:02:35.275
Anyway, they were,
like, already putting it out

02:02:35.277 --> 02:02:36.575
and so John's really frustrated,

02:02:36.577 --> 02:02:39.111
so he's gonna put some
of the lawn chairs

02:02:39.113 --> 02:02:42.182
the kitchen chairs
back on the...

02:02:52.961 --> 02:02:54.860
Mrs. Rawlings, I was
surprised to hear from you.

02:02:54.862 --> 02:02:56.302
I want you to listen to me.

02:02:57.866 --> 02:03:00.669
Underneath this table
is a bag of money.

02:03:01.702 --> 02:03:03.636
I want you to use that money

02:03:03.638 --> 02:03:05.741
to help rebuild
the school library.

02:03:07.207 --> 02:03:08.376
All I ask...

02:03:09.544 --> 02:03:11.080
name it after Marcus.

02:03:28.296 --> 02:03:29.397
Alice?

02:03:38.439 --> 02:03:39.875
How you been?
