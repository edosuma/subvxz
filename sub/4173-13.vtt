Wait...
(SLURPS)

01:09.069 --> 01:13.699
Hi, guys. Hey, Baljeet.
How was physics camp?

01:13.699 --> 01:14.825
Positively remedial.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.076
How much more basic can you get

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
than the surface tension
of water droplets?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.080
Surfer tension?
What's that?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.666
Surface tension is the
property which allows

01:22.666 --> 01:25.210
molecules of water on its
surface to form a sort of

01:25.210 --> 01:30.048
stretchy skin which allows it to retain
its shape and durability at a small size.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.093
Cool! Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.720

of my busy social calendar

01:38.932 --> 01:41.977
I often forget to have quality
time with my pet goldfish, Biff.

smell you later.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.732

Wow.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.109
"Smell you later" sounds a lot
more formal when you bow.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.737
Well, Ferb, I know what the
rest of us are gonna do today.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.614

Cool. So what do you
want to do today?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.051
I don't know. I thought maybe
we could head to the mall.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.427
I suppose we could
go to the mall again.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.471

02:59.471 --> 03:01.223

03:01.223 --> 03:03.809
Wow, you are so predictable.
So ordinary!

03:03.809 --> 03:05.227
Predictable?
Ordinary?

03:05.227 --> 03:07.479
I mean, come on,
I play 2O instruments!

03:19.366 --> 03:22.077
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sorry.
Forget the mall.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.996
I'm gonna think of something else to do
that's really cool and totally different.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.207
'Cause, you know, I got to
be my unpredictable self.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209

later you'll tell me Phineas
and Ferb are up to something,

03:42.013 --> 03:45.225
but there's nothing there to see, so we
all have pie. Just another ordinary day.

for the hottest day
of the year?

04:06.163 --> 04:10.125
I might as well be doing hot yoga up in
this piece! Can I get a "what, what"?

04:12.043 --> 04:13.879

04:13.879 --> 04:16.964
<i>I'm sorry, sir. People

04:16.964 --> 04:19.216
How do you stay
so current?

04:19.216 --> 04:22.012
Ah, Perry the Platypus!
Won't you have a seat?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.848
That is not not
how you sit on a chair.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.517
Which means it is! Because
I used a double negative.

04:27.517 --> 04:31.396
Sure, it's grammatically incorrect, but
it is the core of my newest creation,

04:31.396 --> 04:34.524
the Double-Negative-inator!

04:34.524 --> 04:38.111
It takes any negative statement and
turns it into a double negative,

04:38.153 --> 04:41.114
which... Which in turn
makes it positive. I...

04:41.114 --> 04:44.034
Anyway, I was dreaming
about cold weather,

04:44.034 --> 04:48.288
and I remembered how much
I love the Minty Wink Egg Nog

04:48.288 --> 04:50.290
they make at
Beverly's Lunch downtown.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.792
<i>So I went out to get one.</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:54.127
<i>But then Beverly told me
I couldn't hove it,</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:56.171
<i>because they only
make it in the winter.</i>

04:56.171 --> 04:58.381

recovered from the shock,

05:03.804 --> 05:05.889
I did what
I always do

a complicated and menacing machine.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.438
All I have to do is blast
Beverly with this and (BUZZES)

she'll be like, "Oh, I guess you can
have it because it's not not winter."

05:17.442 --> 05:21.530
And suddenly, I'm drinking
Minty Wink Egg Nog, baby!

05:21.530 --> 05:25.325
Perhaps then I can make myself not
not ruler of the Tri-State Area!

10:11.736 --> 10:14.280
<i>Let's see what the
judges hove to soy.</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:17.117
<i>(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Wow! That puts
Rodney and Fluffy in the lead</i>

10:17.117 --> 10:18.785
<i>and almost impossible to beat!</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:21.162
<i>Next up ore Buford
and his pet goldfish, Biff,</i>

10:21.162 --> 10:23.289
<i>doing their version
of the hoop jump trick.</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:24.791
<i>Good luck topping
that one, guys.</i>

10:24.791 --> 10:27.293
Okay, Biffy, we're up.
Jump through the...

10:33.174 --> 10:34.801
Oh, no! Public art!
Right ahead!

10:34.801 --> 10:37.303
It must be part of the Public
Art Relocation Program!

10:37.303 --> 10:38.513
(ALL SCREAMING)

10:42.934 --> 10:44.310
(ALL LAUGHING)
PHINEAS: Yeah!

10:48.314 --> 10:51.151
You did it, Biff!
We're number one!

10:51.151 --> 10:52.652
Congrats, guys!
Thanks.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.821
I'm gonna put Biff's prize
money in a scholarship fund

10:54.821 --> 10:57.323
for that fancy fish
school in the Maldives.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.326
Wait until you see this giant
ball of water! PHINEAS: Hi, guys!

11:00.326 --> 11:02.537
Come on in,
the water's great!

11:02.537 --> 11:05.290
You're right, Candace, there
is a giant ball of water.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.333
Though most people
prefer to call it a lake.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.835
Wow! A party
on the lake?

11:08.835 --> 11:09.961
I never would've
thought of that!

11:09.961 --> 11:11.838
You come up with
the best ideas.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.465
You really want to
go to the mall again?

11:14.465 --> 11:16.301
We're teenagers.
It's what we do.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.471
Ha! You mi... Ow!

11:20.471 --> 11:22.724
(GRUNTS) Well,
that was refreshing.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.855
(EXPLOSION) Oh, that was not
not the self-destruct button.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.233
(GRUNTS) Well, 0h, man, once
again, the place is trashed,

11:32.233 --> 11:35.486
you just take off, leaving
me here to clean it all up.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.322
Does it ever occur to you,
Perry the Platypus,

11:37.322 --> 11:41.242
how much of a mess is left after
one of our little tete-a-tetes?

11:41.242 --> 11:45.205
That I keep talking to you
for a while after you're gone!

11:45.205 --> 11:47.498
I mean, it's probably a sad
commentary on my life

11:47.582 --> 11:51.377
that I'm wearing an apron and talking
to a platypus that's no longer...

11:51.377 --> 11:53.504
How long have you been
standing there, Vanessa?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.256
VANESSA: Long enough, Dad.
