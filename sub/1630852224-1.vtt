02:30.018 --> 02:32.651
Hey, Lexi.
It's me, Mikey.

02:33.518 --> 02:34.451
Mikey.

02:34.484 --> 02:36.818
No, no, no, no. Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

02:36.852 --> 02:40.818
I got a big fucking
surprise for you.

02:43.785 --> 02:46.085
- Who is it?
- I was cleaning...

02:46.118 --> 02:47.985
Hey! Surprise!

02:48.018 --> 02:49.918
Hey. Hey, Lil.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.752
Oh, my shit.

02:51.785 --> 02:53.752
Nice to see
you, too, uh...

02:53.785 --> 02:55.118
How you been?
How you been?

02:56.451 --> 02:58.118
Okay...

02:58.152 --> 03:00.985
- It's me, Mikey. Remember me?
- I know.

03:01.018 --> 03:03.052
I know.
What are you doing here for?

03:03.085 --> 03:05.118
Well, I just
came to see Lexi,

03:05.152 --> 03:06.585
and, well, I came
to see you of course.

03:06.618 --> 03:08.518
Both of you guys.
But is Lexi here right now?

03:08.918 --> 03:09.985
Lexi!

03:10.018 --> 03:11.052
- Thank you.
- What?

03:11.085 --> 03:12.852
You won't believe
who's here.

03:13.518 --> 03:14.918
Oh, my gosh.

03:16.785 --> 03:18.052
Oh, my shit.

03:18.085 --> 03:19.518
Surprise!

03:19.551 --> 03:21.852
Oh, my God, what the...
What are you doing here?

03:21.885 --> 03:23.852
Aw! It's good
to see you, too.

03:23.885 --> 03:24.952
Why are you here?

03:24.985 --> 03:27.118
Fuck. Oh, God damn it.
Where do I begin. Uh, look...

03:27.152 --> 03:28.451
No, you're not coming
in this house.

03:28.484 --> 03:29.852
- All beat up.
- That's right.

03:29.885 --> 03:31.718
- What... What the fuck?
- All right...

03:31.751 --> 03:34.085
All right, well,
I'll tell you what's...

03:34.118 --> 03:36.085
Yeah,
why are you here?

03:36.118 --> 03:37.686
- Yeah.
- Uh, well...

03:37.718 --> 03:38.618
Why are you here?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.052
Mom, Mom,
can you give me a minute?

03:40.085 --> 03:41.118
Lil, I just wanted
to come in,

03:41.152 --> 03:42.518
and hang
for a couple of days.

03:42.551 --> 03:44.085
No, you're not
coming in here.

03:44.118 --> 03:45.152
You're not coming
in my house.

03:45.185 --> 03:47.518
Mom, can you
just go inside and...

03:48.585 --> 03:50.952
- The fuck, Mikey?
- I... I know.

03:50.985 --> 03:52.551
I know.
This is unexpected.

03:52.585 --> 03:54.652
Oh, nothing with you
is unexpected.

03:54.686 --> 03:57.551
You still got that sass!

03:59.751 --> 04:01.785
Look, I don't know
what you want,

04:01.818 --> 04:03.619
but I can't help you.

04:03.652 --> 04:06.685
So it doesn't matter how
or why you're here.

04:06.718 --> 04:07.852
Go away.

04:08.718 --> 04:11.585
- Hey, Lil.
- Ma!

04:11.619 --> 04:13.484
- God damn it.
- Look, I don't want

04:13.518 --> 04:14.451
to be here, all right?
This is embarrassing.

04:14.484 --> 04:15.418
Well, I don't
want you here either.

04:15.451 --> 04:16.652
You think I want to
show up like this?

04:16.685 --> 04:18.918
I got my ass fuckin' kicked.
I just need a place to crash.

04:18.952 --> 04:20.584
- Why can't you be cool?
- What does it look like?

04:20.619 --> 04:22.084
- A hotel?
- Really? It's like that?

04:22.118 --> 04:24.418
Can you get off
the property, please?

04:24.451 --> 04:26.551
What, why... What are you
fucking going do? Really?

04:26.586 --> 04:27.952
Well, you...
Oh, you want me to call the cops?

04:27.985 --> 04:29.484
- I'll call the cops.
- Don't. Don't fucking...

04:29.518 --> 04:31.384
- No, I'm calling the cops.
- Fuck!

04:31.418 --> 04:32.985
- Nine, eight...
- God...

04:33.018 --> 04:35.018
Seven... Faster!

04:35.052 --> 04:36.518
I'm technically
off the property,

04:36.551 --> 04:37.619
so you can't
call the cops,

04:37.651 --> 04:40.551
because I'm on public land
respecting your boundaries!

04:40.586 --> 04:42.451
- Can you keep it down?
- Can you come over here

04:42.484 --> 04:44.484
so I don't have to project my
voice, please?

04:44.518 --> 04:46.118
Oh, fuck!

04:47.384 --> 04:49.918
Seriously, I just need a place
to crash for a couple of days.

04:49.952 --> 04:53.085
- What's the big deal?
- Mikey, go fuck yourself.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.052
Oh, you don't even know
what I've been through.

04:55.085 --> 04:56.918
- Oh, right.
- Look at my fucking face!

04:56.952 --> 04:58.619
I just was
on a bus for two days.

04:58.651 --> 05:00.451
I had to walk here
from the bus station...

05:00.484 --> 05:01.852
Why don't you stay
with your mama!

05:01.885 --> 05:03.852
My mom's in a nursing home
in Le Marque.

05:03.885 --> 05:05.751
A care home.
I can't sleep there.

05:06.885 --> 05:08.451
Mikey,
what do you want?

05:08.484 --> 05:09.751
- My God, I just...
- What do you want?

05:09.785 --> 05:10.952
I just fucking told you.

05:10.985 --> 05:13.586
I just need to crash
for a couple days.

05:13.618 --> 05:14.751
What, you want money,
right? Here.

05:14.785 --> 05:18.718
- I don't want fucking money.
- I got 22 fucking dollars.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.518
Here, come get it.
I can't come on your property.

05:20.552 --> 05:22.418
- Come get your money.
- You should've called!

05:22.451 --> 05:25.018
If I would've called,
you would've said "no."

05:25.052 --> 05:26.818
I'm still saying "no,"

05:26.852 --> 05:28.152
so you fucked yourself
by coming.

05:28.185 --> 05:30.586
Oh, please, come on.
You know me.

05:30.618 --> 05:31.818
Damn straight, I do.

05:31.852 --> 05:32.885
You know me
and you know

05:32.918 --> 05:33.952
I wouldn't be
literally begging

05:33.985 --> 05:35.018
if I had
somewhere to go.

05:35.052 --> 05:36.085
And if you don't
let me in,

05:36.118 --> 05:38.052
I'm going to sleep in
Tarpey fucking Park tonight,

05:38.085 --> 05:39.384
is that what you want?

05:39.418 --> 05:40.451
You said
you were never going

05:40.484 --> 05:42.085
to step a foot
in Texas again.

05:42.118 --> 05:44.852
And then the world fucked
me, what can I say.

05:45.585 --> 05:47.618
- Peek-a-boo!
- Ma!

05:47.651 --> 05:49.152
See, your mom's saying,
"Let him in.

05:49.185 --> 05:50.552
"Let him in
and take a shower."

05:50.585 --> 05:51.651
And the dog's like,

05:51.685 --> 05:54.085
"Oh, he's a good man,
I can tell by his nice energy."

05:54.118 --> 05:56.484
Please let me take
a fucking shower.

06:17.885 --> 06:20.085
<i>The shit got
out of fucking control.</i>

06:20.118 --> 06:21.519
<i>If I didn't see it
with my own eyes,</i>

06:21.551 --> 06:22.485
<i>I wouldn't believe it.</i>

06:22.519 --> 06:24.485
The place turned
into a fucking trap house

06:24.519 --> 06:25.751
right under my nose.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.018
Fucking Speigler sends me
some scraggly bitch from Ohio

06:28.052 --> 06:29.785
that he promised
would be chill.

06:29.818 --> 06:31.585
Her first night in the
house, she gets in a fight,

06:31.618 --> 06:33.152
knocks this
fucking bitch out.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.885
Crack. Right in front of me.
I was like, "Holy shit!"

06:35.918 --> 06:37.052
So, anyway, she bounced.

06:37.085 --> 06:39.551
Now, I got to fill the room
so I don't lose the month

06:39.585 --> 06:40.852
and her friend comes
and stays there

06:40.885 --> 06:42.418
and gets high
the whole fucking time.

06:42.452 --> 06:43.785
Why didn't you just
kick the bitch out?

06:43.818 --> 06:44.918
Well, I had seven hoes

06:44.952 --> 06:47.085
and they're letting MS-13
deal drugs the whole time.

06:47.118 --> 06:49.452
Lil, MS13 is a gang you
don't want to fuck with.

06:49.485 --> 06:51.518
You're good? You're good?
Okay. You need any coffee?

06:51.551 --> 06:53.118
All right. Sorry.
So, anyway.

06:53.152 --> 06:55.685
Long story short.
I ended up hiding out in my room,

06:55.718 --> 06:57.751
because these dudes were
straight fucking killers

06:57.785 --> 06:59.018
and I didn't wanna
fucking get killed

06:59.052 --> 07:00.818
so I played video games
the whole time.

07:00.852 --> 07:02.651
Remember the house
in Chatsworth?

07:02.685 --> 07:04.685
Mm-hmm.
- Well, this place was, like,

07:04.718 --> 07:06.685
maybe five times bigger.
Beautiful house.

07:06.718 --> 07:07.818
I had a two-year lease

07:07.852 --> 07:09.685
with an option to buy it at
the end of the lease, right?

07:09.718 --> 07:13.152
Well... As usual,
shit got fucking crazy.

07:13.185 --> 07:15.618
I snapped, I got up in
one of those cholos' faces

07:15.651 --> 07:16.818
because I'm not
a little bitch.

07:16.852 --> 07:18.818
I came this fucking close
to getting shot.

07:18.852 --> 07:20.485
This fucking close.

07:20.518 --> 07:21.751
So then I had to crash
with Kennedy.

07:21.785 --> 07:24.384
You remember Kennedy?
Remember...

07:24.419 --> 07:25.751
Do you remember Kennedy?

07:25.785 --> 07:27.152
Anyway, I had to crash
at Kennedy's

07:27.185 --> 07:28.985
for, like, three weeks
until he kicked my ass out

07:29.018 --> 07:30.052
'cause someone left
his back door open

07:30.085 --> 07:32.585
and his cute little cat
got out and got killed.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.818
And it wasn't me,

07:33.852 --> 07:34.618
it was some dumb cunt that
he fucked the night before.

07:34.651 --> 07:35.651
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to swear.

07:35.685 --> 07:37.885
But I don't do that,
everyone blames me, like,

07:37.918 --> 07:39.152
"Oh, Mikey's the bad guy."

07:39.185 --> 07:40.585
It's, like, whatever,
it's bullshit.

07:40.618 --> 07:42.718
So, anyway,
I had to crash at his place.

07:42.751 --> 07:43.852
He kicks me out,

07:43.885 --> 07:46.118
for, like, three nights,
I slept on the fucking street,

07:46.152 --> 07:47.385
I slept in a alleyway.

07:47.419 --> 07:49.052
I used my shoes
as a goddamn pillow.

07:49.085 --> 07:51.585
It's fucking bullshit,
my neck was so sore,

07:51.618 --> 07:54.052
I got beat up,
that's how all this happened.

07:54.085 --> 07:56.118
Two homeless fuckers
beat the shit out of me.

07:56.152 --> 07:58.118
They took everything except
my phone and my wallet.

07:58.152 --> 07:59.585
And the only reason
they didn't get that

07:59.618 --> 08:02.085
is the cop showed up
and arrested my ass!

08:02.118 --> 08:03.718
Why'd you get arrested?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.818
I have a feelin' there's a
whole lot more to this story.

08:05.852 --> 08:06.852
I'm sure there is.

08:06.885 --> 08:09.152
It doesn't even matter.
Look, guys.

08:09.185 --> 08:10.852
This could be fun,
this could be cool.

08:10.885 --> 08:12.818
I got a plan.
While I was on the bus,

08:12.852 --> 08:14.918
I thought about this,
I gave it some serious thought.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.852
Lil, you know I'm not a
freeloader, right?

08:16.885 --> 08:18.518
- While I'm here...
- How long?

08:18.551 --> 08:19.585
"How long" what?

08:19.618 --> 08:21.451
How long do you plan
on staying?

08:21.484 --> 08:23.018
Well, I mean, that's up to
you, and Lexi of course,

08:23.052 --> 08:24.852
but look, I saw some
hiring signs on the way in.

08:24.885 --> 08:25.918
I'll go downtown tomorrow,

08:25.952 --> 08:27.618
and I'll get a job
that pays cash.

08:27.651 --> 08:29.018
I'll teach fucking karate
if I have to.

08:29.052 --> 08:30.085
I just got my green belt.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.551
I'll make cash and I'll
help out around here.

08:32.585 --> 08:34.152
You need a man
around the house. Okay?

08:34.184 --> 08:35.650
I already see
shit's falling apart,

08:35.684 --> 08:37.650
I can help out
with all that shit, right?

08:37.684 --> 08:41.118
I want at least $200 a week.

08:41.152 --> 08:43.018
Thank you, Lil,
you're not going to regret this.

08:43.052 --> 08:45.952
Seriously, thank you so much
for trusting me... I'll...

08:45.985 --> 08:48.852
Let's give it a couple
of days and see how it goes.

08:48.885 --> 08:50.018
Yeah, whatever
you're comfortable with.

08:50.052 --> 08:51.885
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable,

08:51.918 --> 08:54.052
I'm here to help.
And look, before long,

08:54.085 --> 08:55.885
it'll be
like we're still married.

08:56.852 --> 08:58.685
We are still married.

09:01.618 --> 09:03.818
Oh, my God,
the backyard's a mess.

09:03.852 --> 09:06.618
See, you need a guy around...
Dude, there's a dragonfly.

09:10.152 --> 09:11.918
<i>...find
out, when she called you...</i>

09:11.952 --> 09:13.085
<i>Now, you traveled?</i>

09:13.118 --> 09:14.785
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>How many days later?</i>

09:14.818 --> 09:16.585
<i>Okay.</i>

09:16.618 --> 09:17.618
<i>This was
about three days.</i>

09:17.651 --> 09:18.651
<i>So,
she called you and said</i>

09:18.685 --> 09:19.852
<i>they were
in a high speed chase...</i>

09:19.885 --> 09:20.551
<i>She said
I was in a high speed chase,</i>

09:20.585 --> 09:23.118
- <i>with Dante...</i>
- Mornin'.

09:23.152 --> 09:25.018
- Mornin'.
- <i>She was chasing him.</i>

09:25.052 --> 09:27.952
<i>He was in the car,
she pulled up,</i>

09:27.985 --> 09:29.918
- <i>somebody told her...</i>
- I love this show.

09:31.118 --> 09:33.718
I watch it everyday,
so get used to it.

09:33.751 --> 09:35.418
<i>And from what I was told,</i>

09:35.451 --> 09:37.618
<i>they were doing like 80.</i>

09:37.651 --> 09:39.818
<i>Down a main street.</i>

09:39.852 --> 09:42.685
<i>She's trying to catch him,
and he hit a pole.</i>

09:42.718 --> 09:43.952
<i>A fence pole.</i>

09:43.985 --> 09:45.718
<i>What do
you say happened?</i>

09:45.751 --> 09:47.152
<i>I was coming back
from the airport,</i>

09:47.185 --> 09:48.952
<i>driving her off as she stated.</i>

09:48.985 --> 09:51.152
<i>And when I was
at the stop sign,</i>

09:51.185 --> 09:53.852
- <i>I had the right of way to...</i>
- Excuse me.

09:55.152 --> 09:58.418
<i>They ran the stop sign
and t-boned the car almost.</i>

09:58.451 --> 10:00.885
<i>Was this your baby
mother in the other car?</i>

10:00.918 --> 10:02.484
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>When she calls you</i>

10:02.518 --> 10:03.618
<i>and she tells you,</i>

10:03.651 --> 10:04.952
<i>'cause I believe
that conversation happened,</i>

10:04.985 --> 10:06.319
- <i>do you call him?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

10:06.351 --> 10:08.484
- <i>And what does he say?</i>
- <i>He like, "Man...</i>

10:08.518 --> 10:11.685
<i>"You know that crazy broad.
It's not my fault.</i>

10:11.718 --> 10:13.751
<i>"She crazy... I was tryna..."</i>

10:13.785 --> 10:16.618
<i>He was in fear for his
safety is what he told me.</i>

10:16.651 --> 10:17.751
<i>Is that
what you said?</i>

10:17.785 --> 10:20.152
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>I don't believe you.</i>

10:20.185 --> 10:22.751
<i>Sir, you have a $500
counterclaim</i>

10:22.785 --> 10:23.818
<i>for emotional distress.</i>

10:23.852 --> 10:25.618
<i>I cannot wait to hear this.</i>

10:25.651 --> 10:27.651
Hey, Lil,
I'm going to borrow

10:27.685 --> 10:29.085
some of your ground beef,
okay?

10:29.118 --> 10:30.384
Okay.

10:34.585 --> 10:36.418
Hey, Lexi?

10:36.451 --> 10:37.685
Hello?

10:37.718 --> 10:38.818
- Yeah?
- Hey.

10:38.852 --> 10:40.618
Uh, I'm not looking
too presentable,

10:40.651 --> 10:41.852
so I'm going to let this
thing go down

10:41.885 --> 10:43.651
before I go
on these interviews.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.651
So, few more days, okay?

10:46.852 --> 10:48.585
All right?

10:48.618 --> 10:50.418
- Sure.
- Thank you.

10:50.451 --> 10:51.585
<i>It was, before she started</i>

10:51.618 --> 10:53.818
- <i>getting into my business.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

10:53.852 --> 10:55.152
<i>So, that's what your
counter claim is about?</i>

10:55.185 --> 10:57.085
<i>She has caused
you emotional distress.</i>

10:57.118 --> 10:58.585
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- <i>Not baby mom...</i>

10:58.618 --> 11:00.918
Put some clothes on
for Christ's sake.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.052
- <i>All of them do.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

11:03.085 --> 11:04.585
<i>They all run together.</i>

11:06.118 --> 11:07.952
<i>Your counterclaim
is dismissed, sir.</i>

11:07.985 --> 11:11.118
<i>Judgment in this case
is for the plaintiff $2902.</i>

11:16.152 --> 11:18.052
Not even one men's shirt?

11:18.085 --> 11:20.751
Beggars can't be
choosers, Mikey.

11:52.985 --> 11:55.885
Your last job listed

11:55.918 --> 11:57.785
is over 17 years ago.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.618
That's quite a gap
in employment.

12:00.651 --> 12:02.518
Well, you know,
I've worked almost everyday

12:02.551 --> 12:03.818
for the last 17 years.

12:03.852 --> 12:05.685
It's just I've been
self-employed.

12:05.718 --> 12:07.484
- What line of work?
- Oh, mostly entertainment.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.618
I've been living
in Los Angeles,

12:08.651 --> 12:10.685
that's why I have the 323
area code right there,

12:10.718 --> 12:12.518
in case you were wondering.
But, yeah.

12:12.551 --> 12:15.119
Film, television,
music, entrepreneurship.

12:15.153 --> 12:17.551
Okay, so why are you
interested in working here?

12:17.585 --> 12:19.052
- Well, I'm living here now.
- Okay.

12:19.085 --> 12:21.119
We were estranged for a
while, I'll be honest.

12:21.153 --> 12:22.651
But, you know,
we're both from here.

12:22.685 --> 12:24.952
And, you know, now that
we're back living here,

12:24.985 --> 12:27.751
we decided
to make a run of it.

12:27.785 --> 12:29.585
Well, we do require
some experience

12:29.618 --> 12:31.685
or some previous training
in the service industry.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.985
- Mm.
- And at least one reference.

12:34.018 --> 12:36.952
Uh, yeah.
That's going to be tricky.

12:36.985 --> 12:39.918
But I did work for
CiCi's Pizza from '99 and 2000.

12:39.952 --> 12:41.785
I think that branch
that I worked for closed.

12:41.818 --> 12:42.852
I put it on there.

12:42.885 --> 12:45.852
But, yeah, you could contact
corporate if you like.

12:45.885 --> 12:47.852
Look, if you were
incarcerated, that's okay.

12:47.885 --> 12:49.052
I just need something

12:49.086 --> 12:50.119
from your parole officer.

12:50.153 --> 12:51.484
<i>All right, look,</i>

12:51.518 --> 12:52.818
I'm going to be straight
with you, all right?

12:52.852 --> 12:53.985
All right. Tell me.
I need that.

12:54.018 --> 12:56.518
Okay. All right, look,
I'll just be honest with you, man.

12:56.551 --> 12:58.152
You don't recognize me,
do you?

12:58.185 --> 13:00.119
I'm an adult film actor.

13:00.918 --> 13:01.985
Excuse me?

13:02.018 --> 13:04.484
A porn star.
I'm a porn star.

13:07.651 --> 13:08.818
I know, I've been working

13:08.852 --> 13:09.918
in the adult entertainment
industry

13:09.952 --> 13:11.852
since 2001 and, you know,
even though...

13:11.885 --> 13:13.384
Did you say porn?

13:13.418 --> 13:15.518
Hey, you know,
it was fun, I think.

13:15.551 --> 13:17.384
- I'm sure it was.
- Yeah, all the ladies...

13:17.418 --> 13:18.685
Why don't you
just google me?

13:18.718 --> 13:20.484
Look up "Mikey Saber."

13:20.518 --> 13:22.451
- Mikey...
- Saber.

13:22.484 --> 13:26.551
S-A-B-E-R XXX. Go ahead.
Search it.

13:26.585 --> 13:27.618
This is unbelievable.

13:27.651 --> 13:29.985
Yeah,
that's what they say.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.518
Yeah,
just pull down... Yep.

13:31.551 --> 13:33.585
That's me right there,
younger me, but...

13:35.451 --> 13:38.118
- Oh, that certainly is you.
- Mm. Yeah.

13:38.152 --> 13:39.952
2,000 movies, six awards,

13:39.985 --> 13:42.551
13 nominations
and Hall of Fame, did that.

13:42.585 --> 13:44.053
I want to, you know,
start fresh,

13:44.086 --> 13:46.985
and really start
a new chapter, a new life

13:47.018 --> 13:48.952
with you,
and your company, ma'am.

13:48.985 --> 13:50.086
I'd really
like to help you,

13:50.118 --> 13:53.818
but, um, my management,
they would not permit this.

13:53.852 --> 13:57.885
I'm sorry,
but you're just simply

13:57.918 --> 14:00.685
overqualified for this job.

14:00.718 --> 14:02.551
I'm just not sure
our customers

14:02.585 --> 14:06.718
would be comfortable
with you waiting on them.

14:06.751 --> 14:09.585
They may have seen
one of your movies.

14:09.618 --> 14:10.885
Later on,
when you get home,

14:10.918 --> 14:12.952
google "Mikey Saber XXX"

14:12.985 --> 14:14.053
and you'll see
what I'm talking about.

14:14.085 --> 14:14.985
- It's some good shit.
- Okay.

14:15.019 --> 14:16.518
- Yeah, yeah I'll do that.
- Thanks, man.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.651
- Thanks, man. Take care now.
- Okay.

14:23.053 --> 14:24.651
<i>I even went
to fucking Luby's...</i>

14:24.685 --> 14:25.885
Nobody's hiring.

14:27.852 --> 14:30.019
At least get your
assistance check.

14:33.052 --> 14:34.852
<i>Well, I may be able
to get you pay stubs</i>

14:34.885 --> 14:36.319

<i>but I had a falling out with
one of the guys over there.</i>

14:39.118 --> 14:40.052
<i>It's a long story.</i>

14:40.085 --> 14:41.052
<i>Okay,
but you need to be</i>

14:41.085 --> 14:42.885
<i>a Texas resident

14:42.918 --> 14:44.085
Oh, no,
I'm residing here.

14:44.118 --> 14:45.818
I moved back in
with my wife last week.

14:45.852 --> 14:46.785
In order
to be a resident,

14:46.818 --> 14:50.019
you need to reside here
for at least 180 days.

14:50.052 --> 14:51.618
So, why don't you
come back

14:51.651 --> 14:54.019
when you can provide me
with a Texas State ID,

14:54.052 --> 14:56.484
and a copy of your
marriage license, okay?

14:56.518 --> 14:57.585
Yes, ma'am.

14:57.618 --> 14:58.685
Also,
I'm a little confused,

14:58.718 --> 15:01.918
is your last name
Davies or Saber?

16:29.451 --> 16:31.919
Mikey? Oh.

16:31.952 --> 16:33.985
Mikey. Okay. Okay.

16:34.018 --> 16:35.818
Is your mom here?

16:35.852 --> 16:37.152
Yeah, she's here.

16:37.185 --> 16:39.618
Can I please speak
with her really quick?

16:39.651 --> 16:41.618
- Yeah, she's out in the back.
- Okay.

16:41.651 --> 16:43.118
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:43.152 --> 16:44.585
- Out back.
- That way?

16:44.618 --> 16:46.018
- Yeah, out back.
- Okay.

16:46.052 --> 16:47.785
Thanks, big dog.

16:58.886 --> 17:00.651
He retarded.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.618
Don't worry about it,
you know the boy is slow.

17:02.651 --> 17:05.018
That's why his head is so big.
Don't talk about the boy.

17:05.051 --> 17:06.085
I don't need him.

17:06.117 --> 17:07.417
I'm just tellin' you
to calm down,

17:07.451 --> 17:08.518
I'm gonna check his ass.

17:08.550 --> 17:10.685
Pardon me,
Leondria.

17:10.718 --> 17:12.051
Hey, it's me, Mikey.

17:13.518 --> 17:14.550
Mikey.

17:15.051 --> 17:16.351
Remember me?

17:17.651 --> 17:19.451
It's okay,
it's been forever.

17:19.483 --> 17:21.718
Lil's son in law. Mikey.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.417
Mikey...

17:24.451 --> 17:25.718
Yeah, it's good
to see you, ma'am.

17:25.751 --> 17:27.651
What the hell are you
doing around here?

17:27.685 --> 17:29.384
Yeah, I'm back in town.

17:29.418 --> 17:32.085
It's so good to see you
again, ma'am, you look great.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.618
- Hey, I'm Mikey.
- My daughter, June.

17:35.618 --> 17:36.885
Uh...

17:36.918 --> 17:38.551
Oh, shit, June.

17:38.585 --> 17:39.785
I haven't seen you since...

17:39.819 --> 17:41.651
Last time I saw you,
you were up to my knee.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.985
You've grown up.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.351
Big girl now.

17:47.451 --> 17:49.484
So, why you back,
Mr. Hollywood?

17:49.518 --> 17:51.585
Oh, uh...

17:51.618 --> 17:54.985
Well, me and the ol' lady
trying to give it another go.

17:55.018 --> 17:56.052
Oh, really?

17:56.085 --> 17:59.085
So you're telling me Lil
is letting you stay there?

17:59.118 --> 18:02.451
Well, yeah, yeah.
I mean, you know, I'm helping out,

18:02.484 --> 18:04.786
and chipping in
around the house.

18:04.819 --> 18:05.885
Which is why I'm here.

18:06.618 --> 18:07.518
So, I was wondering

18:07.551 --> 18:10.685
if maybe I could move
some bud for you?

18:10.718 --> 18:12.451
Like I did back in the day.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.085
Hmm...

18:15.918 --> 18:17.585
Speaking of
back in the day,

18:18.518 --> 18:20.585
you sound brand new.

18:20.618 --> 18:22.585
Oh, the accent?
Yeah...

18:22.618 --> 18:25.852
Yeah, I had to lose it
for the biz, ma'am.

18:25.885 --> 18:27.852
But y'all know I'm still
a Texas boy at heart.

18:27.885 --> 18:29.985
Mm-hmm.
You helpin' Lil with the rent?

18:30.018 --> 18:31.451
Of course!

18:31.484 --> 18:32.585
But, uh...

18:32.618 --> 18:33.952
I'm kinda cash poor
at the moment,

18:33.985 --> 18:35.985
do you think you could
put me on Front Street?

18:39.985 --> 18:41.118
Let's start
with an ounce.

18:41.152 --> 18:42.718
Yeah, that'd be great.

18:42.752 --> 18:44.786
- Thank you.
- Hey, June. Hey, Le.

18:44.818 --> 18:45.885
Hey darlin'.
How are you?

18:45.918 --> 18:47.685
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good, good, good.

18:47.718 --> 18:49.752
- Good, good, good.
- Everything is fine.

18:49.786 --> 18:52.118
You're looking good.
I know. You're looking good.

18:52.152 --> 18:53.918
You ladies have a nice day.

18:53.952 --> 18:55.651
You, too, Mikey.

18:55.685 --> 18:57.052
All right, girl...
Anyways, girl, so...

18:59.185 --> 19:01.085
Yeah, so, I kinda changed the...
Yeah.

19:01.118 --> 19:02.651
- I like the color.
- Girl, thank you.

19:02.685 --> 19:04.418
Yeah, what color is that?

19:06.518 --> 19:08.685
I bet you
any goddamn money,

19:08.719 --> 19:11.085
his ass gonna
smoke that shit himself.

19:11.118 --> 19:12.952
Well, I'm glad I gave
him some Reggie Bush.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.518
That's what
I'm talking about.

19:14.551 --> 19:15.985
You're smart, baby girl.

19:16.952 --> 19:17.985
- A pipe.
- Okay.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.152
- And those baggies.
- Yeah.

19:19.185 --> 19:20.818
And let me get
Dutch Masters.

19:20.852 --> 19:21.785
Wait, no, no.
Yeah, those.

19:21.818 --> 19:22.985
- Those papers right there.
- Oh, this one?

19:23.018 --> 19:24.052
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, okay.

19:24.085 --> 19:25.384
I'm a patriotic boy.

19:38.751 --> 19:40.818
<i>...but to do that,</i>

19:40.852 --> 19:43.052
<i>we must break free</i>

19:43.085 --> 19:46.484
<i>from the petty politics

19:46.518 --> 19:50.885
<i>America is a nation

You weren't
bullshitting.

20:09.785 --> 20:11.618
I don't bullshit.

20:11.652 --> 20:13.518
Just please don't give me
that snicklefritz shit again,

20:13.551 --> 20:14.686
or I won't get repeaters.

20:15.785 --> 20:17.686
It's not snicklefritz shit, son.

20:17.718 --> 20:18.718
Much better.

20:21.484 --> 20:22.484

20:25.518 --> 20:26.484
Hey, Leo.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.152

- Hey, darlin'.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.852

20:31.952 --> 20:33.918
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

20:49.518 --> 20:51.484
Yes.

20:53.918 --> 20:54.918
Got 'em.

20:55.718 --> 20:56.751
Hello, ma'am.

20:56.785 --> 20:58.585
Hey, how you doin' today, honey?

20:58.619 --> 21:00.785
Doin' good. You got

21:02.185 --> 21:03.384

- Oh.

21:03.852 --> 21:04.718
I like this.

21:04.751 --> 21:06.652
You think this is
a good color on me?

21:06.685 --> 21:08.018
Oh, absolutely.

21:08.052 --> 21:09.185
Let me get that.

21:09.219 --> 21:11.619
You have a fitting room?
Or do I just have to risk it?

21:11.652 --> 21:14.384
Yeah I think this shirt will
look real nice on you, hon.

21:17.451 --> 21:19.952
If I buy all those clothes,
throw this in for a dollar.

21:19.985 --> 21:21.018
- All right. Deal.
- Okay?

21:21.052 --> 21:22.085
Deal.

21:22.118 --> 21:23.518
- Sold.
- Sold.

21:23.551 --> 21:24.384
Sold!

21:25.852 --> 21:28.451
Lil, as a token
of my appreciation,

21:28.484 --> 21:30.885
step up from
your restaurant ashtray,

21:30.918 --> 21:32.551
and okay...

21:32.586 --> 21:35.518
This doesn't change anything,
but I do like it.

21:53.818 --> 21:56.552
Damn, dope ride.

21:56.586 --> 21:59.085
Uh, yeah, man.
Can I help you?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.118
Wow.

22:01.152 --> 22:02.818
I'm next door.
I'm living next door.

22:04.185 --> 22:06.118
Oh, yeah?
Wait a second.

22:08.018 --> 22:10.118
Shit, you're Mikey!

22:10.618 --> 22:11.651
Yeah.

22:11.685 --> 22:12.785
Yeah, man, it's...

22:12.818 --> 22:14.384
It's me, man.
It's me, Lonnie!

22:15.018 --> 22:16.152
Do I know you?

22:16.185 --> 22:19.484
Well, I mean, kinda.

22:19.519 --> 22:21.918
I mean, I live here,
obviously.

22:21.952 --> 22:23.418
And, uh...

22:23.451 --> 22:24.952
No, Lexi, man.

22:24.985 --> 22:26.785
Lexi used to babysit me
all the time.

22:26.818 --> 22:28.651
Oh, yeah.

22:28.685 --> 22:30.384
Yeah, my parents came home
one night,

22:30.418 --> 22:32.052
y'all were humpin'
in their bedroom.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.118
You jumped
out the window naked!

22:34.152 --> 22:36.018
They called the cops
on you and everything.

22:36.052 --> 22:37.651
Yep, yep, now I remember.

22:37.685 --> 22:39.818
Oh, shit, your mother
hates me.

22:39.852 --> 22:40.751
Uh, well, I mean,

22:40.785 --> 22:43.552
she hated you, man.
Uh, yeah, she died.

22:43.585 --> 22:45.585
Oh. Damn,
sorry to hear that.

22:45.618 --> 22:46.785
No, I mean, it's good, man.

22:46.818 --> 22:48.685
I mean,
it happened over a year ago.

22:48.718 --> 22:50.018
Bladder cancer.

22:50.052 --> 22:51.885
- Shit's a motherfucker.
- Ah, shit.

22:51.918 --> 22:53.651
That sucks.

22:53.685 --> 22:55.384
Hey, we should hang out
sometime.

22:55.418 --> 22:56.818
Take a spin in this bad boy.

22:56.852 --> 22:57.885
Uh, yeah, man.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.384
What are you even
doing back here?

22:59.418 --> 23:00.718
Oh, it's a long story,

23:00.751 --> 23:02.152
but do you think you could
take me downtown tomorrow?

23:02.185 --> 23:03.384
We could catch up.

23:03.418 --> 23:06.018
Yeah, dude. I would love to.
I got nothin' else to do.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.885
Hell, yeah.
Thanks, bro. Uh...

23:07.918 --> 23:09.818
Hey, let's just get you
some shoes on this bitch.

23:09.852 --> 23:10.985
You're good to go.

23:11.018 --> 23:13.018
- Yeah, man. I can't wait.
- All right.

23:13.052 --> 23:14.952
And welcome back, dude!

23:14.985 --> 23:16.852
Fuckin' Mikey, man. Shit.

23:19.519 --> 23:20.519
Fuckin' Mikey.

23:34.718 --> 23:37.585
Oh, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.852
Hey, great life choice,
guys, seriously.

23:47.485 --> 23:48.551
So stupid.

23:54.985 --> 23:56.085
Her doctor cut

23:56.118 --> 23:58.685
her pain meds in half,
you fucking asshole.

23:58.718 --> 23:59.785
Yeah, right.

24:01.651 --> 24:02.952
Oh,
this is a pimp mobile

24:02.985 --> 24:04.751
if I ever rode in one, Lonnie.

24:04.785 --> 24:06.484
Man, I'm not gonna
lie to you, Mikey,

24:06.518 --> 24:09.419
I never thought I'd see you
back in Texas City, brother.

24:09.452 --> 24:11.585
Yeah, me neither.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.118
God, I remember
when y'all left, man.

24:14.152 --> 24:16.618
You all were like celebrities,
you know?

24:16.651 --> 24:18.852
Fuckin' two porn stars,
the couple. Oh!

24:18.885 --> 24:20.018
Yeah? That's cool.

24:20.052 --> 24:23.618
Oh, dude, they used to
show Lexi's fuckin' videos

24:23.651 --> 24:25.885
at every one
of the high school parties.

24:25.918 --> 24:27.818
And I got to brag, man,

24:27.852 --> 24:29.484
because
she was my neighbor.

24:29.518 --> 24:30.852
And babysitter.

24:30.885 --> 24:33.018
Yeah, man.
And babysitter, man.

24:33.052 --> 24:33.952
Look, man,
I've got 800,

24:33.985 --> 24:36.152
almost 900 subscribers
on my Pornhub channel.

24:36.185 --> 24:38.518
And I got
one of the highest ratings.

24:38.551 --> 24:41.152
That's not just male talent,
that's overall.

24:41.185 --> 24:43.385
I've got
an 81% positive click rate.

24:43.419 --> 24:45.585
I was at this coffee shop in the
Valley, and these people were like,

24:45.618 --> 24:46.852
"Oh, shit,
that's Mikey Saber."

24:46.885 --> 24:48.385
Right here, bro.
Go right, right, right.

24:50.718 --> 24:52.685
Yeah, bro,
they recognized me.

24:52.718 --> 24:53.985
They're like, "Oh,
that's Mikey Saber.

24:54.018 --> 24:56.085
They took a picture of me,
tagged me on Instagram.

24:56.118 --> 24:57.918
And next thing you know,
I had 100 new followers.

24:58.985 --> 25:00.885
- 100 followers?
- Yep.

25:00.918 --> 25:02.918
I don't even have
100 followers.

25:02.952 --> 25:04.085
Well,
if you stick with me,

25:04.118 --> 25:05.885
I'll get
your followers up, baby.

25:05.918 --> 25:07.785
Jenna Haze, man...

25:07.818 --> 25:09.052
- Huh?
- Jenna Haze, man...

25:09.085 --> 25:10.118
Oh, yeah, Jenna.

25:10.152 --> 25:12.518
Yeah, I did at least
three scenes with her, man.

25:12.551 --> 25:15.484
She's a nasty bitch,
let me tell you.

25:15.518 --> 25:17.152
<i>Make it rain on that ass</i>

25:17.185 --> 25:19.551

<i>All night long.</i>

25:24.352 --> 25:26.852
She ran my bill
up to $1500 bucks.

25:26.885 --> 25:28.818
It's like,

25:28.852 --> 25:29.952
Fuck, if I know!

25:29.985 --> 25:33.118
Shit, yeah.
But she's a beautiful girl, man!

25:33.152 --> 25:34.518
- I can't hear you.
- I said,

25:34.551 --> 25:36.118
"Yeah, but she's
a beautiful girl, man."

25:36.152 --> 25:38.785
Oh, yeah, she's fuckin'

25:39.751 --> 25:42.018
Oh, God,

Mm.

26:14.118 --> 26:15.651
<i>...who you trust</i>

26:15.685 --> 26:17.052

Whatcha doing?

26:35.985 --> 26:38.118
- I'm watching TV.
- Oh.

26:38.152 --> 26:39.985
No way.
What are you watching?

26:40.018 --> 26:41.818
None of your business.

26:41.852 --> 26:43.918
- I love that show.
- Oh, my God.

26:44.651 --> 26:46.118
Hey, you, uh...

26:47.518 --> 26:48.818
You wanna hang out
and stuff?

26:49.918 --> 26:51.618
Do I want to hang out
and stuff?

26:51.651 --> 26:52.651
Yeah.

26:53.651 --> 26:54.685
What?

26:54.718 --> 26:55.718
Do you want to hook up?

26:57.085 --> 26:58.651
Do I want to hook up?

27:00.185 --> 27:02.018
Do... Do you want to fuck?

27:05.451 --> 27:06.818
Are you serious

27:06.852 --> 27:09.118
Yeah, I'm serious,

27:11.152 --> 27:14.351
- Come on.
- Okay, hurry.

27:15.852 --> 27:16.852
Phew.

27:23.718 --> 27:27.085
<i>...and no scratches. Look!
Burnt cheese...</i>

27:34.685 --> 27:36.052
Mm!

27:36.085 --> 27:37.651
Your body looks good.

27:37.685 --> 27:39.651
You been working out?

27:41.852 --> 27:43.118
- What?
- So...

27:44.618 --> 27:45.751
We're done here.

27:46.451 --> 27:47.484
What do you mean?

27:47.518 --> 27:48.818
What? I can't sleep here?

27:48.852 --> 27:49.885
No.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.484
- Really?
- Go back to the sofa.

27:52.518 --> 27:54.518
Come on now.

27:54.551 --> 27:56.484
Jesus. Oh, my God.

28:18.518 --> 28:19.518
That was fun.

28:26.651 --> 28:28.685
Sophie, I fucked your mom
last night.

28:28.718 --> 28:30.518
Oh, my God,
can you keep it down?

28:30.551 --> 28:31.818
- Oh, stop.
- Shut your...

28:31.852 --> 28:32.918
You love it.

28:34.852 --> 28:36.985
Don't think this is going
to become a regular thing.

28:43.518 --> 28:44.985
Think you can
cut the lawn today?

29:17.685 --> 29:20.018
That's right, I'm
back, I'm back in town,

29:20.052 --> 29:21.085
you've seen me before.

29:21.119 --> 29:22.153
Don't act
like you ain't seen me,

29:22.185 --> 29:23.585
she recognized me.

29:25.451 --> 29:26.918
You know, uh,
in high school,

29:26.952 --> 29:28.086
I beat this guy's ass

29:28.119 --> 29:29.818
- like 25 years ago.
- No way.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.818
We had a misunderstanding
on the basketball court

29:31.852 --> 29:33.985
over a basketball game.

29:34.018 --> 29:36.484
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

29:36.518 --> 29:39.119
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you!
Happy... ♪</i>

29:39.152 --> 29:40.518
<i>And to many more!</i>

29:41.952 --> 29:44.086
Mom, we just want to say
happy birthday.

29:44.119 --> 29:47.518
And we hope you have many more.

29:48.451 --> 29:50.018
Thank you, honey!

29:50.052 --> 29:52.651
- Yeah.
- This one.

29:52.685 --> 29:55.585
I guess you can set it down,
thank you all for comin' out!

30:17.086 --> 30:18.618
- Zena. Zena Valentine.
- Yeah.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.618
Zena. Melissa. Yeah.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.551
Yeah, man, you were
in a bunch of her scenes.

30:22.585 --> 30:24.718
Uh, she was in a bunch
of my scenes, technically.

30:24.751 --> 30:26.852
But yeah,
that was my girl after Lexi.

30:26.885 --> 30:27.818
Bitch goes and marries

30:27.852 --> 30:30.384
some rich software dork
she met in Vegas.

30:30.418 --> 30:31.252
I think they have a kid,

30:31.285 --> 30:33.152
they live in Salt Lake
or something.

30:33.185 --> 30:34.885
Boring fucking life.

30:34.918 --> 30:36.384
- Wow, man...
- Yeah.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.618
Who do you think
discovered her?

30:37.651 --> 30:38.718
I got her signed
to Renegade,

30:38.751 --> 30:39.985
I taught her the pole.

30:40.019 --> 30:41.118
I dealt with her crazy

30:41.152 --> 30:44.085
drugged-out ass
for a year, man.

30:44.118 --> 30:46.484
As soon as the bitch's head
gets big, they betray you.

30:47.718 --> 30:49.451
That's what happened
with Lexi, you know?

30:49.484 --> 30:50.985
- Really? Lexi?
- Yep.

30:51.019 --> 30:53.585
Jules Jordan bought her out
from under me for 10 grand

30:53.618 --> 30:55.785
the first chance he got,
that fucker.

30:55.818 --> 30:57.618
Wait, he bought her?

30:57.651 --> 30:58.985
Yeah, he paid her
10 grand to betray me,

30:59.019 --> 31:00.651
but the joke's
on Jules, though.

31:00.685 --> 31:02.651
She went from doing roxies
to smokin' tar

31:02.685 --> 31:05.118
the minute I wasn't there
to straighten her ass out.

31:05.152 --> 31:07.019
We were together
for five years.

31:07.053 --> 31:08.585
Five fuckin' years.

31:08.618 --> 31:10.618
She won two AVNs
under my watch.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.019
She leaves me,
bitch gets shot out in nine months,

31:13.052 --> 31:13.986
couldn't book shit.

31:14.019 --> 31:15.651
And then she goes,
and moves in with mommy

31:15.685 --> 31:18.718
exactly one year after
she left me high and dry.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.585
- Shit.
- Yeah, shit is right.

31:20.618 --> 31:22.618
Hey, is Whispers
in Galveston still open?

31:30.118 --> 31:32.451
You're not leaving that
dirty glass in the sink.

31:32.852 --> 31:34.952
- No, sir.
- Okay.

31:34.986 --> 31:36.019
Clean it up.

31:36.052 --> 31:37.118
Okay.

31:43.852 --> 31:45.953
That's right,
we all do our share.

31:45.986 --> 31:47.518
Mm-hmm. Okay.

31:47.551 --> 31:48.986
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

31:49.018 --> 31:49.953
What about the others?

31:49.986 --> 31:50.986
- Those are yours, too.
- Lil, look. All right.

31:51.018 --> 31:53.418
The last three houses
I lived in had dishwashers,

31:53.451 --> 31:54.484
I'm not doing the dishes.

31:54.518 --> 31:56.018
- I don't do that shit, right?
- You do not live here.

31:56.052 --> 31:57.618
This is my kitchen.

31:57.651 --> 31:59.018
If you can't follow
the rules...

31:59.052 --> 32:00.953
- Out! Out! Out!
- Why are you talking to me

32:00.986 --> 32:02.384
- like a little kid.
- Hey, Lexi!

32:02.418 --> 32:03.986
Don't you disrespect
your mother-in-law!

32:04.018 --> 32:05.118
Your mom's starting shit
with me.

32:05.152 --> 32:07.384
Can you please inform her
I'm not a dick?

32:07.418 --> 32:08.651
Why would I lie
to my mother?

32:08.685 --> 32:10.085
Oh, you, too, huh?
Really?

32:10.118 --> 32:11.852
You're just gonna turn on me like
that, after...

32:11.885 --> 32:12.919
I've been mowing
the fucking lawn.

32:12.953 --> 32:13.986
- Oh, my God.
- What?

32:14.018 --> 32:15.052
You've been
mowing the lawn.

32:15.085 --> 32:15.986
What? Yeah, I've been
mowing the lawn.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.384
- Jesus Christ, Mikey.
- You've been leaving

32:17.418 --> 32:18.518
dirty dishes in the sink.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.618
You haven't given me
a dime.

32:20.651 --> 32:22.052
I know, but I'm going
to pay you guys,

32:22.085 --> 32:23.085
but look,
I've been walkin' the dog.

32:23.118 --> 32:25.118
- I'm providing protection.
- She's an outside dog!

32:25.152 --> 32:26.152
She doesn't need walkin',
Mikey!

32:26.185 --> 32:27.418
I'm providing security.
I've been helpin' out.

32:27.451 --> 32:28.418
We don't need security.
Do we need a security guard, Mom?

32:28.451 --> 32:30.484
- Oh, come on.
- I didn't know that we hired

32:30.518 --> 32:31.618
a security guard.

32:31.651 --> 32:33.018
Yeah, you...
You're safe now because I'm here.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.418
You're always
on my couch.

32:34.451 --> 32:36.152
You've been drinking
all my Ensures.

32:36.185 --> 32:37.451
Listen, I'm trying
to get a job.

32:37.484 --> 32:39.152
You've been here
for three weeks now!

32:39.185 --> 32:40.384
I've been looking
for a job the whole time.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.118
- I want you out of here now.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

32:41.152 --> 32:43.052
Wait, wait.
Listen, listen.

32:43.085 --> 32:43.985
I know I said I'd help out
with the rent.

32:44.018 --> 32:45.551
- You did. You did.
- No, wait a minute.

32:45.585 --> 32:46.751
Let me finish.

32:46.785 --> 32:48.085
I know I said
I'd help out with the rent.

32:48.118 --> 32:49.585
- Yeah.
- So...

32:49.618 --> 32:50.818
I'm not gonna
help out with the rent.

32:50.852 --> 32:52.551
Well, get
the fuck out, then!

32:52.585 --> 32:54.518
I'm gonna pay
the whole goddamn thing!

32:56.818 --> 32:58.518
- Now you're talkin'.
- Uh-huh.

32:58.551 --> 33:00.384
August is on Mikey,
motherfuckers!

33:00.418 --> 33:01.618
Yeah! Look
how your eyes light up

33:01.651 --> 33:02.818
like a little
Christmas tree.

33:02.852 --> 33:03.919
The whole month.
The whole month.

33:03.952 --> 33:04.886
- Yes, the whole month.
- Okay.

33:04.919 --> 33:07.585
So let's go get some
fuckin' donuts, on me,

33:07.618 --> 33:09.418
'cause I take care of shit
around here.

33:09.451 --> 33:11.651
And whatever fuckin' donuts
you want, let's go.

33:11.685 --> 33:14.118
I just wanted to get you
guys taken care of, okay?

33:14.152 --> 33:15.985
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:16.018 --> 33:17.718
My favorite place.

33:17.751 --> 33:19.585
I know, Lil.
You love this place.

33:20.018 --> 33:21.152
Yes.

33:21.185 --> 33:23.152
I might have one bite.
I don't know, I'll see.

33:23.185 --> 33:24.853
You think it's too late
for me to get coffee?

33:24.886 --> 33:26.518
You can get coffee
whenever you want.

33:26.551 --> 33:27.651
I just don't think
it's gonna be

33:27.685 --> 33:29.052
the best coffee
in the world, but...

33:29.085 --> 33:31.853
Here, look. I even got
the door. I got the door.

33:31.886 --> 33:34.118
- I got the door.
- Thank you.

33:34.152 --> 33:35.484
- Here we are.
- Mom, come on.

33:35.518 --> 33:36.818
- Good evenin'.
- Hello.

33:36.853 --> 33:38.585
- Hello.
- Whatever these ladies want.

33:38.618 --> 33:40.685
- Okay.
- I want donut holes,

33:40.718 --> 33:42.853
and jelly filled donut,
and a cappuccino.

33:42.886 --> 33:43.918
There you go,
make it a large.

33:43.952 --> 33:45.651
- Give her an extra-large cup.
- For here or to go?

33:45.685 --> 33:47.585
- What do you want, for here?
- Yeah.

33:47.618 --> 33:48.785
- Do you want it here?
- What do you think?

33:48.818 --> 33:49.853
We're just gonna go,

33:49.886 --> 33:50.785
we're gonna eat it
just on the road?

33:50.818 --> 33:53.718
Give her the largest
cappuccino that you got,

33:53.751 --> 33:55.418
- and whatever drink she wants.
- I'll have a small coffee.

33:55.451 --> 33:57.484
Give her a large. Get a...
Now's the time. Get a large.

33:57.518 --> 33:58.651
Yeah, I'll get
a large coffee, and...

33:58.685 --> 34:00.085
- And...
- With lots of cream.

34:00.118 --> 34:01.853
- Sure.
- And a little bit of sugar.

34:01.885 --> 34:03.384
What other donuts
do you want?

34:03.418 --> 34:05.018
- Um, I wanna have...
- She wants a pink.

34:05.052 --> 34:06.853
I want a pink...
Yeah, pink sparkle, please.

34:06.885 --> 34:08.484
Give her the pink sparkles.
Whatever she wants.

34:08.518 --> 34:09.618
And then I can get...

34:09.650 --> 34:11.618
Ooh, can I get a chocolate, too?
Can I get a chocolate?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.650
- Thank you.
- Whatever they want. Okay?

34:13.685 --> 34:14.885
Donut holes, please.

34:14.918 --> 34:15.985
Yeah,
get the donut holes.

34:16.018 --> 34:17.551
Yeah, this is the day
to get everything you want.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.618
This is the day
that the Lord hath made.

34:19.650 --> 34:21.118
- Mr. Moneybags here.
- Thank you.

34:21.152 --> 34:23.018
- Okay.
- All right.

34:23.052 --> 34:24.819
Look at that, huh?
We got the holes, you're good.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.018
Is that enough
for you guys?

34:26.052 --> 34:27.717
You should get it while
we're here 'cause this is it.

34:27.751 --> 34:28.650
All right. There you go.
That's...

34:28.685 --> 34:29.551
- Is that one yours?
- Is that the cappuccino?

34:29.585 --> 34:31.518
Okay, that's the cappuccino.
This one's...

34:31.551 --> 34:32.585
That's the biggest one
they got.

34:32.618 --> 34:34.751
I don't know what more you want me to do.
All right.

34:34.786 --> 34:35.851
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

34:35.885 --> 34:37.384
You guys go ahead
and sit down.

34:37.418 --> 34:38.685
I'll grab this.
How much is that?

34:38.717 --> 34:42.786
- $6:32.
- $6:32. All right.

34:43.952 --> 34:45.018
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

34:45.052 --> 34:46.685
Can I get some napkins,
please?

34:46.717 --> 34:48.451
- Thank you, yeah.
- All righty.

34:49.851 --> 34:52.518
And here's your change.

34:58.718 --> 35:00.085
Thank you, kindly.

35:06.985 --> 35:08.952
Mm. I'm going
to save the pink sprinkle,

35:08.985 --> 35:10.152
this one, for last.

35:10.185 --> 35:12.518
This one, I don't know
what to do with.

35:12.551 --> 35:13.985
I don't know what to do
with that one.

35:14.018 --> 35:16.085
I don't know what to do
with that, Ma. Look.

35:16.118 --> 35:17.551
- All right, I'll have one.
- Don't you feel like it? Okay.

35:17.585 --> 35:18.685
- Just tear me half.
- Eat the part that doesn't

35:18.718 --> 35:19.618
- have the sprinkle on it.
- I don't want the colored one,

35:19.651 --> 35:21.685
just give me half of
one of the donut balls.

35:21.718 --> 35:23.152
- Half of a donut ball?
- Why do they call it a hole?

35:23.185 --> 35:25.052
I don't understand why
it's a hole if it's the...

35:25.085 --> 35:26.952
The hole is in the middle.

35:26.985 --> 35:28.952
That's where
it came out of.

35:28.985 --> 35:31.585
Right. Okay,
that makes sense.

35:31.618 --> 35:33.585
This one doesn't have
enough sprinkles on it.

35:33.618 --> 35:34.719
See that?

35:34.752 --> 35:35.786
What do you guys, uh...

35:35.818 --> 35:37.685
Can you guys wrap this up?
We got to get out of here.

35:37.719 --> 35:38.918
- Okay.
- Excuse me...

35:38.952 --> 35:40.185
What... No, Mom.
I am eating.

35:40.219 --> 35:44.118
I am going to savor every
goddamn sparkle on this donut.

35:44.152 --> 35:46.952
- Keep it down.
- What? She don't care.

35:46.985 --> 35:49.418
I know but it's rude,
we just came in...

35:50.785 --> 35:52.585
I don't know
why he's walkin' so fast.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.052
- Just hurry up.
- Must be a fire somewhere.

35:55.085 --> 35:56.585
I'm full!

35:56.618 --> 35:58.852
Come on,
we're full of donuts.

35:58.885 --> 36:01.018
- Okay, come on.
- I gotta pee.

36:01.052 --> 36:02.719
Stop act...
You get so dramatic.

36:02.752 --> 36:04.085
I'm not acting.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.551
What, are you training
for a marathon?

36:05.585 --> 36:07.118
Lil, will you tell
your daughter to...

36:07.152 --> 36:08.651
Is this the Olympics?

36:08.686 --> 36:11.118
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Are we going to a fire?

36:11.152 --> 36:13.618
Fire? What do you mean?
We're going home.

36:13.651 --> 36:15.418
- I'm full!
- I can't run

36:15.451 --> 36:16.852
- in these shoes, Mikey.
- All right.

36:16.885 --> 36:18.952
I don't wanna
throw up my cookies!

36:18.985 --> 36:21.451
Oh, shit, I forgot...
I forgot cigarettes.

36:21.484 --> 36:22.451
Oh, I got a pack.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.618
And I forgot rollin' papers.
I'll be right back.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.052
- All right.
- Yep.

36:26.085 --> 36:27.085
All right.

37:17.518 --> 37:18.518
Psst!

38:31.451 --> 38:33.118
Hello?

38:37.518 --> 38:38.384
- Hi.
- May I help you?

38:38.418 --> 38:41.552
Hi. Yeah. Uh, the ginger
that works here,

38:41.586 --> 38:43.484
she works Tuesdays, no?

38:43.518 --> 38:45.952
- Ginger?
- Uh, red-haired girl.

38:45.985 --> 38:47.918
- Raylee.
- Raylee, yeah.

38:47.952 --> 38:50.785
I called her ginger,
but Raylee. Yeah, Raylee.

38:50.818 --> 38:52.651
- Are you friend of hers?
- Very good friends with her,

38:52.685 --> 38:53.852
I just wanted
to come say "hi."

38:53.885 --> 38:57.552
I always get Tuesdays and
Wednesdays mixed up. So...

38:57.586 --> 38:59.085
Yeah, she doesn't
work Tuesdays.

38:59.118 --> 39:01.552
Right, okay. Yeah,
I'll just give her a call

39:01.585 --> 39:02.785
or a text or whatever.

39:06.451 --> 39:08.685
But... But she does
work Wednesdays, right?

39:08.718 --> 39:12.118
- Yeah, she works Wednesdays.
- Okay. Okay. Thought so, yeah.

39:12.152 --> 39:14.651
- You want a donut?
- Uh, how much?

39:16.918 --> 39:18.818
Mm.

39:28.685 --> 39:30.052
Top of the morning
to ya.

39:30.085 --> 39:31.618
Good morning, sir.
What can I grab you?

39:31.651 --> 39:34.052
Uh, it's Mikey, not sir.
I'm not that old.

39:34.085 --> 39:35.685
All right,
pleased to meet you, Mikey.

39:35.718 --> 39:37.485
- What's your name?
- Uh, Raylee.

39:37.519 --> 39:39.985
Raylee,
that's a beautiful name.

39:40.018 --> 39:42.585
- What do you recommend?
- Depends on what you like.

39:42.618 --> 39:44.685
- Um, custard one is good.
- Mm.

39:44.718 --> 39:47.384
- Jelly is sweet.
- Hmm.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.152
- Glazed is a favorite.
- Ooh, is that your favorite?

39:49.185 --> 39:50.618
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I might...

39:50.651 --> 39:52.052
I might have
to try that one.

39:52.085 --> 39:55.018
Uh, what did the donuts do
on their first date?

39:55.052 --> 39:56.418
I beg your pardon?

39:56.451 --> 39:57.718
What did the donuts do
on their first date?

39:57.751 --> 39:58.985
I don't know.

39:59.018 --> 40:00.118
They glazed

40:00.152 --> 40:01.485
into each other's eyes.

40:01.519 --> 40:03.384
That's so stupid.

40:03.418 --> 40:05.018
But I can't believe I haven't
heard that one before.

40:05.052 --> 40:06.551
Well, I wrote it,
you couldn't have heard it.

40:06.585 --> 40:08.384
I kinda write donut jokes

40:08.418 --> 40:10.985
on the side.
It's one of my many talents.

40:11.018 --> 40:12.185
- Okay.
- Yeah. But I'm thinkin',

40:12.219 --> 40:14.751
I don't know,
maybe I'll just go with the chocolate,

40:14.785 --> 40:16.718
and gotta get
some milk with...

40:16.751 --> 40:18.985
Oh, you guys go ahead,
I'm gonna need a minute.

40:19.018 --> 40:20.952
- Thank you, buddy.
- Hey. What can I grab ya?

40:20.985 --> 40:22.852
I would like
a large coffee, please.

40:22.885 --> 40:25.651
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, one hazel cream,

40:25.685 --> 40:27.685
- and two chocolate donuts.
- Okay.

40:28.618 --> 40:29.985
Help yourself
to the cream.

40:30.018 --> 40:31.485
And what can I get
for you, sir?

40:31.518 --> 40:33.419
I'll get a coffee black,

40:33.452 --> 40:36.018
and a filled donut,
and that'll be it for me.

40:36.052 --> 40:37.485
Sweet. Can they share
the same bag?

40:37.518 --> 40:38.985
- Yes, that's fine.
- All right.

40:40.018 --> 40:41.085
Good to conserve.

40:41.118 --> 40:42.651
All righty,
and your coffee

40:42.685 --> 40:44.751
is coming right up, sir.

40:46.484 --> 40:48.551
- Good morning.
- What's the damage?

40:48.585 --> 40:50.785
Uh... $6.32.

40:50.818 --> 40:52.419
- Here you go.
- Out of ten.

40:59.484 --> 41:01.885
Hey, Ms. Phan, can I get
some help out here?

41:01.918 --> 41:03.918
- Thank you.
- Oh!

41:03.952 --> 41:06.685
- Oh, there's your tip.
- Thank you.

41:06.718 --> 41:07.985
Next customer, please.

41:08.018 --> 41:10.085
Hey, when do things
slow down around here?

41:10.118 --> 41:12.451
- Uh, excuse me?
- What time does it wind down?

41:12.484 --> 41:14.618
Uh, we are slammed
until, like, 2:00-ish.

41:14.651 --> 41:15.818
I'll see you at 2:00.

41:15.852 --> 41:17.685
- Next customer, please.
- Okay.

41:17.718 --> 41:19.585
I'm sorry about that.
Uh, what would you like?

41:38.818 --> 41:41.018
I'm back,
just like I promised.

41:41.052 --> 41:42.018
I'm a man of my word,

41:42.052 --> 41:44.685
so, in the future,
you can always rely on me.

41:44.718 --> 41:46.685
Mm. Back to tell
more donut jokes?

41:46.718 --> 41:49.385
No, that was actually
the only donut joke I had,

41:49.418 --> 41:51.118
and it took me a very
long time to write that one.

41:51.152 --> 41:52.651
It's all I got.
Why, do you have any?

41:52.685 --> 41:54.718
Actually, I do.

41:54.751 --> 41:58.518
Um, what do you call
a Jamaican donut?

41:59.985 --> 42:02.718
Hmm, I like where this is going.
Give me a minute.

42:02.751 --> 42:05.585
Uh, Jamaican donut, huh?
I'm stumped.

42:06.418 --> 42:09.018
Cinnamaan.

42:09.052 --> 42:10.451
- I got to go.
- No.

42:10.484 --> 42:11.785
No, no, seriously,
that was really...

42:11.818 --> 42:13.484
That hurt my feelings,
that was terrible.

42:13.518 --> 42:15.518
That's okay, I forgive you.

42:15.551 --> 42:18.484
- So Raylee, I'm thinking...
- Call me Strawberry.

42:20.585 --> 42:22.384
- Call you what?
- Strawberry.

42:22.418 --> 42:23.518
- Strawberry?
- Mm-hmm.

42:23.551 --> 42:25.451
- Everybody calls me that.
- You're kidding.

42:25.985 --> 42:28.085
Okay. How old are you?

42:28.118 --> 42:29.952
- Who's asking?
- Me.

42:29.985 --> 42:31.651
- Why?
- Come on.

42:31.685 --> 42:33.918
- I'm old enough.
- For what?

42:35.451 --> 42:39.551
Oh, God. I'll be 18
in three weeks, okay?

42:39.585 --> 42:41.585
I knew it,
you're too old for me.

42:43.518 --> 42:45.085
Anyway, Strawberry.

42:45.118 --> 42:47.052
I can't believe that's
your name

42:47.085 --> 42:48.651
I don't know
what donut to get.

42:48.685 --> 42:49.651
I need your help.

42:49.685 --> 42:52.451
I really like the look
of those donut holes.

42:52.484 --> 42:53.585
And those, you know...

42:53.618 --> 42:55.818
Do you frost, do you do the
sprinkles, do you do those?

42:55.852 --> 42:56.785
How... Who makes them?

42:56.818 --> 42:58.918
I do the sprinkles,
and I fill the cream.

42:58.952 --> 43:00.018
- You fill the cream.
- Yeah.

43:00.052 --> 43:01.085
I just want the ones
that you make.

43:01.118 --> 43:02.384
- Okay.
- I want the ones

43:02.418 --> 43:03.551
that you cream-filled.

43:03.585 --> 43:05.152
Does that sound...
Oh, I don't want to get you in trouble.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.918
I'm thinking
maybe a chocolate round,

43:08.952 --> 43:11.852
or maybe I'll get
a strawberry-filled.

43:11.885 --> 43:14.618
- No pun intended.
- Oh, God.

43:14.651 --> 43:16.484
I don't
think she likes me very much.

43:16.518 --> 43:18.518
I don't think
she likes anyone very much.

43:18.551 --> 43:20.551
Yeah,
she's a mean boss.

43:20.585 --> 43:22.651
Anyway, okay.
So, yes, I've decided.

43:22.685 --> 43:24.384
Chocolate round.

43:24.418 --> 43:27.685
Okay, but you want
chocolate sprinkles?

43:27.718 --> 43:29.384
Chocolate cake?

43:29.418 --> 43:30.785
Chocolate Bavarian cream?

43:30.818 --> 43:31.918
There's all those
different chocolates?

43:31.952 --> 43:33.018
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.

43:33.052 --> 43:34.384
Now I got to stay here

43:34.418 --> 43:35.551
for a few more hours
and decide.

43:35.585 --> 43:36.985
Son of a bitch.

43:37.018 --> 43:38.085
Are you trying
to keep me here?

43:38.118 --> 43:39.152
'Cause
I'll sit in the corner

43:39.185 --> 43:41.152
and contemplate this for
a while until you get off.

43:41.185 --> 43:42.118
What time do you get off?

43:42.152 --> 43:44.785
<i>Oh, feels
so fucking good!</i>

43:44.818 --> 43:46.918
Oh, shit! Fuck, yeah, babe!

43:46.952 --> 43:49.052
- Yeah, you like that shit?
- Oh, yeah.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.751
You like that big dick
inside of you,

43:50.785 --> 43:52.484
- you fucking little slut.
- God, I love this big dick.

43:54.718 --> 43:57.918
- Not bad, huh?
- No, not bad at all.

43:57.952 --> 44:00.818
And I didn't even have to take
one of my magic pills. Hmm.

44:03.418 --> 44:06.018
Uh, I didn't know
you were usin' 'em.

44:06.052 --> 44:07.785
- Well, yeah.
- Oh.

44:07.818 --> 44:10.785
You remember how hard it is
to keep wood on set all day.

44:10.818 --> 44:12.785
Yeah.

44:12.818 --> 44:15.518
Remember when Kristina Rose
almost broke it off?

44:15.551 --> 44:17.152
I do. I do.

44:17.185 --> 44:19.085
I'm surprised
it even works at all.

44:19.118 --> 44:21.118
Oh, it sure works.

44:21.152 --> 44:23.751
Oh, yeah.

44:27.484 --> 44:29.685
Love the exterior
decorating, sir.

44:29.718 --> 44:30.751
It's looking spiffy.

44:38.651 --> 44:40.618
All right, Dad,
we'll be back around 5:00.

44:44.885 --> 44:47.052
You think
he remembers me?

44:47.085 --> 44:49.818
Man,
ever since my mom died,

44:49.852 --> 44:52.651
all he cares about is keeping
this place immaculate.

44:54.484 --> 44:56.418
Matter of fact,
I've been screwed out

44:56.451 --> 44:58.585
of Male Performer of the year
literally five times.

44:58.618 --> 44:59.952
But you know what?

44:59.985 --> 45:01.384
I don't say shit,
it's all good.

45:01.418 --> 45:02.618
I'm a team player.

45:02.651 --> 45:03.918
Almost every single girl
I did a scene with

45:03.952 --> 45:05.718
started fucking me
off-camera, right?

45:05.751 --> 45:07.018
But the agents hate that shit.

45:07.052 --> 45:08.852
But what do they expect?
You know?

45:08.885 --> 45:10.885
It's like, girl comes by
my model house,

45:10.918 --> 45:13.418
they see my Hall of Fame
trophy on the mantelpiece.

45:13.451 --> 45:15.985
They're like, "Oh, my God.
He's famous for fucking."

45:16.018 --> 45:17.785
Wait,
you used to have your own model house?

45:17.818 --> 45:19.818
I had three
model houses, bro.

45:19.852 --> 45:23.618
And the last one...
Ooh, that was a savage-ass house.

45:23.651 --> 45:25.952
Till I started letting agents
book bottom bitches in there.

45:25.985 --> 45:27.118
Bottom bitches?

45:27.153 --> 45:28.418
Yeah, bottom bitches

45:28.451 --> 45:29.585
are technically
the best of the hookers,

45:29.618 --> 45:30.852
but they're
still the hookers,

45:30.885 --> 45:31.952
and that's what
they started sending me,

45:31.985 --> 45:33.153
was the fucking hookers.

45:33.186 --> 45:34.285
And that's when
everything went to shit.

45:34.319 --> 45:37.451
'Cause see, once a porn chick
gets a hooker mentality,

45:37.484 --> 45:38.918
they become
a fucking nightmare.

45:38.952 --> 45:40.885
A real pain in my ass.

45:40.918 --> 45:42.384
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:42.418 --> 45:44.618
Dude, I forgot how hot
Gulf Coast bitches are.

45:44.651 --> 45:46.718
I saw this girl over by the
donut shop at the refinery.

45:46.751 --> 45:48.119
She works there,
smokin' hot.

45:48.153 --> 45:49.451
Gorgeous,
drop dead gorgeous.

45:49.484 --> 45:52.018
And get this,
17 years old.

45:52.052 --> 45:54.052
Legal as an eagle.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.685
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:59.052 --> 46:01.651
Hey, man, see that strip
of land over there?

46:01.685 --> 46:03.052
Yeah?

46:03.085 --> 46:05.518
Them's the Texas
Killing Fields, brother.

46:12.852 --> 46:14.384
- Strawberry?
- Yeah?

46:14.418 --> 46:16.818
- You blaze, right?
- Why, are you a cop?

46:16.852 --> 46:19.384
- Let's go smoke one.
- Hmm.

46:19.418 --> 46:21.985
Hey, Ms. Phan.
Can I take my ten?

46:34.618 --> 46:37.018
<i>So,
what do you do in LA?</i>

46:37.052 --> 46:39.618
- I'm in entertainment.
- I knew it.

46:39.651 --> 46:42.018
You have that Hollywood vibe.

46:42.053 --> 46:43.718
- Yeah, you think?
- Yeah.

46:43.751 --> 46:44.852
Oh.

46:44.885 --> 46:47.351
So,
what do you do in entertainment?

46:47.952 --> 46:49.952
Manager
slash agent.

46:49.985 --> 46:51.053
Like, for actors?

46:51.086 --> 46:53.751
Yeah.
That weed is good, right?

46:53.785 --> 46:54.885
If you
or your friends want any,

46:54.918 --> 46:57.018
I can get a whole bunch more,
no problem.

46:59.518 --> 47:01.451
So...

47:01.484 --> 47:04.152
You live in Hollywood,
managing actors,

47:04.185 --> 47:07.551
but you're in Texas City,
riding a bike,

47:07.585 --> 47:09.918
sellin' weed, and hittin'
on high schoolers?

47:09.952 --> 47:11.952
Well, my Camaro is in LA.

47:11.985 --> 47:14.585
You know, I wasn't going
to drive all the way to Texas,

47:14.618 --> 47:15.952
it's like
a three-day drive.

47:17.152 --> 47:18.818
All right, look,

47:18.852 --> 47:20.085
I'm here taking care
of my mom.

47:20.118 --> 47:21.852
All right?
She's not doing too well.

47:23.785 --> 47:24.918
I'm sorry.

47:24.952 --> 47:26.718
It's all right.

47:26.751 --> 47:27.852
But you're a good son

47:27.885 --> 47:29.718
- for being there for your mom.
- I am.

47:32.152 --> 47:34.618
By the way,
who smokes joints anymore?

47:34.651 --> 47:37.118
That's so old man-y.

47:37.152 --> 47:39.484
That was fun, we should
do that again sometime.

47:39.518 --> 47:41.019
Yeah, I'll smoke
your weed anytime.

47:42.785 --> 47:44.852
Hey, by the way,
you can move all your shit

47:44.885 --> 47:46.918
on the hardhats
from the refinery.

47:46.952 --> 47:48.418
I see them
at the end of their shift,

47:48.451 --> 47:49.986
and they want
to kill themselves.

47:51.152 --> 47:52.585
See you later, alligator.

47:52.618 --> 47:54.418
In a while, crocodile.

48:03.986 --> 48:06.019
<i>Did the dress designer</i>

48:06.052 --> 48:07.952
<i>cause a prom queen
to be late for the ball?</i>

48:07.986 --> 48:09.219
<i>I went there,
all he had</i>

48:09.252 --> 48:12.384
<i>was the cut-out fabric
and the applique sewn on.</i>

48:12.418 --> 48:14.019
<i>That's all he had...</i>

48:14.052 --> 48:16.685
- Oh! Oh, shit!
- Oh, my gosh.

48:16.718 --> 48:18.418
I'm sorry!

48:18.451 --> 48:20.818
Sorry, Lil. Aw, man!

48:23.852 --> 48:25.751
I thought you found
my couch comfy.

48:25.785 --> 48:27.885
Oh, I do, I just...
I sleep <i>au naturel.</i>

48:28.852 --> 48:30.518
- Cut the shit.
- My bad.

48:39.685 --> 48:41.484
Mikey.

48:41.518 --> 48:42.618
All seriousness.

48:42.651 --> 48:45.518
I appreciate you
taking care of the bills.

48:45.551 --> 48:49.018
That way it keeps Lexi from
being on the Craigslist.

48:50.651 --> 48:51.852
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

48:51.885 --> 48:53.052
Yeah, I understand...
Yeah.

48:53.085 --> 48:56.618
So, I need to know,
are you in or out?

48:57.052 --> 48:58.919
If you're in,

48:58.953 --> 49:00.785
I welcome you here.

49:00.818 --> 49:02.018
All right, okay, great.

49:02.052 --> 49:03.085
'Cause if you're out,

49:03.118 --> 49:04.152
don't let the door hit you
in the ass.

49:04.185 --> 49:05.852
No, no. I'm in. I'm in.

49:05.885 --> 49:07.852
- Okay, fine.
- I'm paying the fucking rent,

49:07.885 --> 49:10.885
- I pay for groceries...
- This is about my baby.

49:10.919 --> 49:12.618
I don't want her
getting hurt anymore.

49:12.651 --> 49:15.685
I don't want her
doin' clients anymore.

49:15.718 --> 49:16.852
It's too dangerous.

49:16.885 --> 49:19.118
I never know
when she's coming home.

49:20.484 --> 49:21.785
So, it's up to you.

49:23.518 --> 49:24.953
I'm in.

49:24.985 --> 49:26.351
Okay? I'm in.

49:27.751 --> 49:30.618
- Okay. Good, good. Good.
- I'm here, all right?

49:31.985 --> 49:33.484
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49:36.985 --> 49:40.018
Anything else?
Am I good to go?

49:40.052 --> 49:42.919
Yes. As long as I don't see
your junk anymore.

49:43.718 --> 49:45.018
Deal.

49:45.052 --> 49:46.785
Your mom's still a trip.

49:46.818 --> 49:48.018
I know.

49:49.886 --> 49:51.685
- In a good way.
- Yeah.

49:52.952 --> 49:54.118
She's a piece of work.

50:00.551 --> 50:01.418
That smoke stack,

50:01.451 --> 50:03.551
second one from the left,
is that new?

50:03.585 --> 50:04.651
Has that
always been there?

50:04.685 --> 50:06.551
No, that's always
been there.

50:06.585 --> 50:07.751
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:07.785 --> 50:08.818
Don't remember.

50:08.853 --> 50:10.451
And Ma calls that one
ol' smokey.

50:10.484 --> 50:11.618
Oh.

50:20.018 --> 50:21.518
It's my ex's truck.

50:23.085 --> 50:25.351
He was supposed to pick
it up two years ago.

50:27.085 --> 50:28.451
Still hasn't.

50:37.551 --> 50:38.819
Just needs new wheels.

50:41.985 --> 50:43.685
Well, I know
you guys get tested,

50:43.718 --> 50:46.618
which is why I got this,
synthetic piss.

50:46.651 --> 50:48.551
I'll throw it in free
with an ounce,

50:48.585 --> 50:49.518
other than that,
10 bucks a pop.

50:49.551 --> 50:51.551
But, yeah, I got you
if you guys ever need it.

50:51.585 --> 50:53.618
You know, I don't want you
guys getting fired and shit.

50:53.651 --> 50:54.785
Don't drink it.

50:54.819 --> 50:55.985
I mean...

50:56.018 --> 50:57.085
Unless you're into that kind of
shit, right?

50:58.418 --> 50:59.451
Good night, Ms. Phan!

50:59.484 --> 51:00.751
- Good night.
- Good night.

51:02.651 --> 51:04.618
See you later, alligator.

51:04.651 --> 51:05.853
Do you want a ride home?

51:05.885 --> 51:08.018
- No, I'm good.
- Throw it in the back.

51:08.052 --> 51:09.985
Uh, well...

51:10.018 --> 51:11.351
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Throw it in the back.

51:11.751 --> 51:12.852
Okay.

51:16.484 --> 51:19.052
- Which way?
- Uh, go left here. Go left.

51:19.085 --> 51:20.451
We're getting close.

51:22.085 --> 51:24.384
I really appreciate you
driving me home.

51:24.418 --> 51:25.685
Mm-hmm.

51:26.484 --> 51:28.384
It's a nice area, huh?

51:28.418 --> 51:29.518
Yeah, it's fancy.

51:29.551 --> 51:30.418
I just wanted
to buy my mom

51:30.451 --> 51:33.052
something nice
to retire in, you know?

51:33.085 --> 51:34.451
That's real sweet of you.

51:34.484 --> 51:35.585
Yeah.

51:35.618 --> 51:37.152
All right.
Yeah, it's right up here.

51:37.185 --> 51:39.551
Hey, we're getting... Yep.
Right up there. There it is.

51:41.518 --> 51:42.885
Maybe we'll...
Can you turn it down?

51:42.918 --> 51:44.786
'Cause we don't...
I don't want to wake up my mom.

51:44.818 --> 51:46.718
Yeah. Whoa,
this is fancy.

51:46.752 --> 51:48.018
Yeah, it's nice.

51:49.018 --> 51:51.651
I'd invite you in,
but like I said,

51:51.685 --> 51:53.052
you know,
my mom's feelin' sick

51:53.085 --> 51:54.985
and she don't take
too kindly to strangers.

51:55.018 --> 51:57.685
She's just not all there,
up there right now.

51:57.718 --> 51:58.752
No. Yeah.

51:58.786 --> 52:00.152
Probably not
a good idea, anyway.

52:00.185 --> 52:02.018
Yeah.
So thanks for the ride.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.152
Anytime.
I work on Wednesday.

52:04.185 --> 52:06.384
Oh, well,
I'll see you Wednesday.

52:06.418 --> 52:07.451
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:39.518 --> 52:40.719
<i>Look, I'm just glad</i>

52:40.752 --> 52:42.052
<i>weed is still illegal
in Texas.</i>

52:42.085 --> 52:44.085
You guys have no idea
how hard it is

52:44.118 --> 52:46.518
to move flower
in Cali right now.

52:46.551 --> 52:47.518
I mean, yeah, you know,

52:47.551 --> 52:49.451
selling it to the bitches
at my model house,

52:49.484 --> 52:52.052
but besides that,
felons and illegals.

52:53.818 --> 52:56.885
Hey, don't mess
with big oil.

52:56.918 --> 53:00.018
TCPD kittens next
to those Valero guys.

53:00.052 --> 53:01.618
That goes without saying,

53:01.651 --> 53:03.818
but you know,
keeping it on the DL

53:03.852 --> 53:05.719
has been the secret to my
success all these years.

53:05.751 --> 53:07.384
How do you think
I stayed out of prison?

53:07.418 --> 53:08.918
How do you think
I never got shot?

53:08.952 --> 53:10.085
Mom,
where's the hot sauce?

53:10.118 --> 53:12.052
Where the hell
it always been.

53:13.551 --> 53:15.118
No hot sauce, Mom.
I don't see it.

53:15.152 --> 53:16.418
Did you look
in your bedroom?

53:16.451 --> 53:17.518
You were
eatin' pizza there...

53:17.551 --> 53:18.451
- Oh, my God, Mom.
- ...the other night.

53:18.484 --> 53:19.719
I don't... I can't...
Where's the hot sauce?

53:19.751 --> 53:21.018
Why would he take it
into his room?

53:21.052 --> 53:22.719
You're laughin',
but you were eatin' pizza there.

53:22.751 --> 53:24.686
Mom, I've checked everywhere
in the kitchen!

53:24.718 --> 53:26.152
Where's the hot sauce?
Hey, man.

53:26.185 --> 53:27.652
What are you lookin' at?
This ain't got nothin' to do

53:27.686 --> 53:28.686
- with you.
- Fine.

53:29.918 --> 53:31.952
The world would
collapse without me.

53:34.718 --> 53:36.518
Did you check
under your bed?

53:36.551 --> 53:39.686
Hey, yo. So, I heard
you do porn or something.

53:39.718 --> 53:40.818
Five AVNs.

53:41.852 --> 53:43.551
What? That's an STD?

53:43.585 --> 53:45.418
No, no, no.
It's the, uh...

53:45.451 --> 53:46.618
It's the Adult Film Awards,

53:46.652 --> 53:49.052
it's like the Academy Awards
for what I do.

53:49.085 --> 53:51.085
- Okay, man. That's what's up.
- Yep.

53:51.118 --> 53:53.018
Best Oral
three years in a row.

53:53.052 --> 53:54.952
- Best oral?
- Yep!

53:55.718 --> 53:56.985
Just one question.

53:57.018 --> 53:58.852
Ain't that
about getting head?

53:58.885 --> 54:00.685
Well, I mean...

54:00.718 --> 54:02.685
Yeah, something like that.

54:02.718 --> 54:04.652
So, then what they got
to do with you?

54:04.685 --> 54:07.551
It's not like you're the one
doing any work or anything.

54:07.585 --> 54:09.852
I'm not doing the work?

54:09.885 --> 54:11.751
Sister,
let me tell you somethin'.

54:11.785 --> 54:13.085
Hey, man,
don't call me sister.

54:13.118 --> 54:15.085
Oh, my bad.
June, right, it's June?

54:15.118 --> 54:16.384
All right, June, look,

54:16.418 --> 54:18.518
if I won three years in a row,
with three different girls,

54:18.551 --> 54:20.685
the chances of it being
the girl is pretty limited.

54:20.718 --> 54:22.085
Think about it.

54:22.118 --> 54:23.018
No, seriously, look.

54:23.052 --> 54:25.118
I'm the one guiding
the girl in the scene.

54:25.152 --> 54:26.852
Essentially
I'm face-fucking her.

54:26.885 --> 54:28.451
Pardon my language.

54:28.484 --> 54:31.619
So the female really has
nothing to do with it.

54:31.651 --> 54:32.718
You know, I'm the one
that's holding her head

54:32.751 --> 54:35.384
for like 15 or 20 minutes
while I'm force-fucking her,

54:35.418 --> 54:36.885
so how is that about her,
exactly?

54:36.918 --> 54:38.152
- I got it, man.
- No, seriously.

54:38.185 --> 54:39.818
Look, it's about
the shit I say,

54:39.852 --> 54:41.619
the way I hold her face
towards the camera

54:41.651 --> 54:43.619
while she spits,
and drools all over herself,

54:43.651 --> 54:45.751
and I pinch her nose
and make her gag.

54:45.785 --> 54:47.785
- It's all technique.
- I said I got it.

55:26.718 --> 55:29.118
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

55:29.152 --> 55:30.751
Thanks, D.

55:31.785 --> 55:34.685
Man, this place
is off the chain.

55:34.718 --> 55:36.818
Thank you so much
for hooking this up.

55:36.852 --> 55:38.118
My pleasure.

55:38.918 --> 55:41.418
So tell me more about LA.

55:43.118 --> 55:45.085
Maybe you should find out
for yourself.

55:45.118 --> 55:46.818
You think
I have the money to go?

55:48.918 --> 55:51.118
You got a truck,
you can go anytime you want.

55:51.152 --> 55:52.852
That's my mama's truck.

55:52.885 --> 55:57.118
She just let's me use it
'cause she works from home.

55:57.152 --> 56:01.118
Well, when I left Texas City,
I didn't have a dime.

56:01.152 --> 56:03.052
I just said to myself,

56:03.085 --> 56:05.018
"Mikey, one day,
you're gonna own this town."

56:05.052 --> 56:06.585
And I just went for it,
you know?

56:07.918 --> 56:09.118
Mm.

56:10.185 --> 56:11.885
What is he doing
behind the counter?

56:11.918 --> 56:14.052
He's going to help me
with my SAT prep.

56:14.852 --> 56:16.384
No free donuts.

56:16.918 --> 56:18.418
Thank you.

56:20.451 --> 56:24.585
So you were saying something
about just going for it.

56:27.685 --> 56:29.751
Are you trying
to get fired?

56:29.785 --> 56:31.384
I'm trying to get hired.

56:34.985 --> 56:38.152
Are you going to help me
score high on my SATs?

56:38.185 --> 56:39.952
You get 600 points

56:39.985 --> 56:41.485
just for signing your name,
you know?

56:41.519 --> 56:43.551
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

56:45.852 --> 56:47.618
Hiya! What can I
get for ya today?

56:47.651 --> 56:48.952
Hi, sweetie.
Can I get, uh, two...

56:48.985 --> 56:51.718
Two chocolate covered
donuts and a medium coffee?

56:51.751 --> 56:53.118
All right.

56:53.152 --> 56:54.618
Good afternoon, sir.

57:00.818 --> 57:03.118
You're crazy,
you know that?

57:03.152 --> 57:05.618
You could have just
waited until now, you know?

57:05.651 --> 57:07.118
Where's the fun in that?

57:07.152 --> 57:08.384
Hmm.

57:12.852 --> 57:13.918
Come here.

57:35.085 --> 57:36.484
Yo, Lonnie!

57:37.618 --> 57:38.685
Wait up!

57:39.718 --> 57:40.952
What's up, man?

57:40.985 --> 57:42.718
What up, big dog,
where you going?

57:42.751 --> 57:44.585
Man, some errands.
I got to go to the mall,

57:44.618 --> 57:46.385
- stuff like that.
- Mm.

57:46.419 --> 57:48.118
Cool. Cool.
I'm rolling with you.

57:48.152 --> 57:50.952
Uh, just warning you, man,
I'm gonna be gone all day.

57:50.985 --> 57:53.551
Just, uh...
So if you don't want to go,

57:53.585 --> 57:54.551
- I mean...
- Whatever.

57:54.585 --> 57:56.385
I just got to get the fuck out
of here. Let's go.

57:56.419 --> 57:59.385
She's smokin' hot.
She made the first move.

57:59.419 --> 58:00.385
She's got no dad.

58:00.419 --> 58:02.985
And here's the kicker,
she lets me sell weed

58:03.018 --> 58:05.385
to the hardhats at her work.

58:05.419 --> 58:06.952
I mean, does it get
any better than this?

58:10.018 --> 58:11.518
I didn't know you served.

58:11.551 --> 58:13.918
Uh... Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I did, man.

58:16.052 --> 58:17.785
Thank you
for your service.

58:17.818 --> 58:19.785
Yeah, man, no, uh...
No problem.

58:23.484 --> 58:27.484
Man, this place ain't changed
much in 15 years, Lonnie.

58:27.518 --> 58:28.852
Yeah, I know,
for real, man.

58:28.885 --> 58:30.685
Hey, um...

58:30.718 --> 58:32.018
I think I'm going to be
hanging out over here

58:32.052 --> 58:33.118
- for a while, okay?
- Okay.

58:33.152 --> 58:35.018
Yeah, I'll meet you back here in
30, all right?

58:35.052 --> 58:36.085
- Thirty minutes?
- Yeah, thirty.

58:36.118 --> 58:36.952
All right, sounds good.

58:49.052 --> 58:50.852
Oh, shit!

58:52.585 --> 58:53.651
Ah...

58:58.085 --> 58:59.518
Oh!

59:01.185 --> 59:02.384
Whoo.

59:05.418 --> 59:06.585
Oh, come on...

59:10.518 --> 59:11.785
Whoo!

59:11.818 --> 59:13.751
So what's
this one, then?

59:13.785 --> 59:15.985
Uh, that's the one I got
when I was in Afghanistan.

59:16.018 --> 59:18.718
And, uh, that's for
my three tours in Iraq.

59:18.751 --> 59:20.118
Bullshit.
You're not even wearing

59:20.152 --> 59:22.418
the proper
infantry uniform.

59:22.451 --> 59:23.985
Well, yeah,
of course I am.

59:27.918 --> 59:29.551
<i>What's
the Army Uniform Regulation?</i>

59:29.585 --> 59:31.152
The code.

59:31.185 --> 59:32.985
Uh, to do my best,

59:33.018 --> 59:35.751
to do my duty
and to serve my country.

59:36.852 --> 59:39.585
You sure
it's not AR670-1?

59:39.618 --> 59:41.818
Uh, well,
as you guys know,

59:41.852 --> 59:44.085
there's a lot of different
codes in the military.

59:44.118 --> 59:46.384
Stolen valor
right here, folks.

59:46.418 --> 59:49.785
This man is not a veteran.
He's a fake and a fraud.

59:49.818 --> 59:51.618
Give me those back,
those are mine.

59:51.651 --> 59:53.484
- Take your jacket off.
- This is bullshit,

59:53.518 --> 59:54.685
what do I have to do to
convince y'all this is from...

59:54.718 --> 59:57.018
Take it off or I'm
gonna fucking kick your ass.

01:00:03.085 --> 01:00:04.118
Hey, man.

01:00:25.484 --> 01:00:27.985
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:29.618
Wait, what?

01:00:29.651 --> 01:00:31.118
Really? I would think
someone in your position

01:00:31.152 --> 01:00:32.351
would know what that means.

01:00:33.551 --> 01:00:36.618
Oh, shit. Yeah, man,
I kinda had, like,

01:00:36.651 --> 01:00:38.618
a little bathroom mishap
in there.

01:00:38.651 --> 01:00:40.551
Oh, man,
little bathroom mishap.

01:00:40.585 --> 01:00:42.651
Oh, you sure you didn't
get pushed in the fountain?

01:00:43.618 --> 01:00:44.818
Shit.

01:00:44.852 --> 01:00:46.451
You fucking saw that, man?

01:00:46.484 --> 01:00:48.384
Dude, I saw the whole
fucking thing, bro!

01:00:48.418 --> 01:00:49.351
You think I'm stupid?

01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:51.085
I can't be associated
with that shit, bro!

01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:53.052
That's fucked up,
that you would let me be a part

01:00:53.085 --> 01:00:55.018
of your fucking
bullshit scheme, dude!

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:57.585
I'm fuckin' pissed!
Dude, what if someone recognized me?

01:00:57.618 --> 01:01:00.384
People know who the fuck I am, dawg.
That's wack.

01:01:00.418 --> 01:01:02.918
You need help, bro.
It's fucking scandalous, dude.

01:01:04.918 --> 01:01:07.351
I'm sorry, man.
Shit, my bad.

01:01:10.018 --> 01:01:14.418
<i>♪ I'll see all my friends

That dope sure makes
you guys religious, huh.

01:02:10.885 --> 01:02:12.451
Just a friend.

01:02:12.484 --> 01:02:14.818
Seems like
a very friendly friend.

01:02:14.852 --> 01:02:17.384
Yeah. It's whatever.

01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:22.685
So I blew him
at junior prom.

01:02:23.718 --> 01:02:25.052
At junior prom?

01:02:25.085 --> 01:02:27.751
No, not at, after.
You know what I mean.

01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:29.751
Anyways,
I blew him at junior prom

01:02:29.785 --> 01:02:32.085
and ever since then,
he's been clingy as fuck.

01:02:32.119 --> 01:02:34.085
Is he stalking you?

01:02:34.119 --> 01:02:36.618
No. No, we hang and shit.

01:02:36.651 --> 01:02:39.351
- You fuckin' him?
- When I feel like it.

01:02:39.952 --> 01:02:41.852
It's not
like a real thing.

01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:43.351
This guy
thinks you're dating.

01:02:44.018 --> 01:02:45.484
- No...
- Raylee,

01:02:45.518 --> 01:02:47.518
- I need you inside!
- Okay!

01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:49.818
And I told you
not to smoke in front.

01:02:49.852 --> 01:02:50.918
Sorry.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:53.618
So you gonna
keep fucking him?

01:02:54.086 --> 01:02:55.918
That depends.

01:02:55.952 --> 01:02:59.551
- Does he know that?
- Mm-mm!

01:02:59.585 --> 01:03:01.618
All right,
what's this guy's name?

01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:02.918
Nash.

01:03:02.952 --> 01:03:04.685
Nash?

01:03:04.718 --> 01:03:05.885
All right, look.

01:03:05.918 --> 01:03:07.384
I think it's time
Nash got it

01:03:07.418 --> 01:03:09.484
that you guys
aren't dating. Come on.

01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:10.918
Wait, what?

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:12.651
God, this is crazy.

01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:14.119
This is crazy,
this is insane.

01:03:14.152 --> 01:03:15.818
I can't believe
we're doing this right now.

01:03:15.852 --> 01:03:17.718
Like...

01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:19.585
Like, maybe it's not
such a good idea, you know.

01:03:19.618 --> 01:03:22.418
It'll be quick and easy,
he'll get the message.

01:03:22.451 --> 01:03:24.018
Okay.
But no fightin', okay?

01:03:24.053 --> 01:03:25.651
I just wanna
talk to him.

01:03:25.685 --> 01:03:27.086
- You promise?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:28.118 --> 01:03:30.651
This is crazy.

01:03:34.785 --> 01:03:36.751
- Now what?
- Is this the house?

01:03:36.785 --> 01:03:38.685
- Yeah.
- Mm.

01:03:38.718 --> 01:03:40.618
Oh, my God!

01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:53.451
Wow, that's his mom?

01:03:53.484 --> 01:03:54.918
Hello, ma'am,
would you be so kind

01:03:54.952 --> 01:03:56.618
as to send
Nash out, please?

01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:02.053
- Raylee?
- Hi, Mrs. Parker.

01:04:08.651 --> 01:04:10.585
Nice necklace.
Fucking dork.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:15.885
What is this?
What's going on?

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:18.518
Hey, buddy, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

01:04:18.551 --> 01:04:21.019
but
you ain't with Strawberry,

01:04:21.053 --> 01:04:23.484
you never were,
she's with me now.

01:04:23.518 --> 01:04:25.918
- You understand?
- Raylee, what is this?

01:04:25.952 --> 01:04:27.152
I've been trying
to tell you, Nash.

01:04:27.185 --> 01:04:28.918
All right, look, bro,
so you're not going to call her,

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.118
you're not going
to text her

01:04:30.152 --> 01:04:31.484
and you're not going to go
by the Donut Hole anymore,

01:04:31.518 --> 01:04:32.384
you understand me?

01:04:32.418 --> 01:04:33.785
Raylee, come on,
I need to talk to you.

01:04:33.818 --> 01:04:36.651
Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro.
Hold on. Hold on.

01:04:37.685 --> 01:04:39.085
Whoa, hey,
no fightin', okay?

01:04:39.118 --> 01:04:40.718
You stay
in the car, babe.

01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:41.885
All right, come here.

01:04:41.918 --> 01:04:44.118
Google me, take out
your phone right now

01:04:44.152 --> 01:04:46.818
and google Mikey Saber.
Do it, you got your phone on you?

01:04:46.852 --> 01:04:48.418
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.085
- No fightin'!
- Babe, it's okay.

01:04:50.118 --> 01:04:52.718
20.1 million views
on Pornhub, bro.

01:04:52.751 --> 01:04:53.952
I'm not fuckin'
with you.

01:04:53.986 --> 01:04:55.718
Strawberry's
in a different league now,

01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:57.052
do you understand me?
You can't compete

01:04:57.085 --> 01:04:58.618
with someone
that fucked 1,300 bitches,

01:04:58.651 --> 01:04:59.785
do you get
what I'm saying?

01:04:59.818 --> 01:05:01.418
Hey,
let's not cause a scene!

01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:03.953
What are you doing?
Who is this?

01:05:03.986 --> 01:05:05.585
- Come on.
- I'm with him now.

01:05:05.618 --> 01:05:07.085
Yeah, you heard it from her
mouth, she's with me.

01:05:07.118 --> 01:05:08.451
Are you serious?

01:05:08.484 --> 01:05:10.418
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, dude.

01:05:10.451 --> 01:05:12.052
- It was fun, though.
- It wasn't fun.

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:23.751
Oh, my God!

01:05:26.618 --> 01:05:27.618
Ah...

01:05:31.018 --> 01:05:32.651
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:05:33.518 --> 01:05:34.718
Yeah, you will.

01:05:57.818 --> 01:06:00.852
Life's sweet, Sophie.
Life is sweet.

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:05.052
X equals negative-b

01:06:05.085 --> 01:06:08.052
plus or minus the square root
of b-squared minus 4ac,

01:06:08.085 --> 01:06:09.585
all over 2a.

01:06:09.618 --> 01:06:11.751
Whoa.
That's geometry?

01:06:11.785 --> 01:06:12.919
Algebra.

01:06:15.718 --> 01:06:16.718
Shit.

01:06:17.785 --> 01:06:19.085
It's all right, relax.

01:06:19.118 --> 01:06:20.651
No, that's Nash.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:21.985
- That's Nash?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:23.052
Shit.

01:06:23.085 --> 01:06:25.384
I think it's time I had a
man-to-man with this kid.

01:06:25.418 --> 01:06:26.952
No fightin'.

01:06:26.985 --> 01:06:29.018
You know what,
I'm tired of your fucking shit, bro.

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:30.886
I'm not afraid to fight
you, I don't give a fuck.

01:06:30.919 --> 01:06:32.484
Oh, what,

01:06:32.518 --> 01:06:33.551
this is your mommy
and daddy,

01:06:33.585 --> 01:06:34.685
you brought them
to the dance?

01:06:34.718 --> 01:06:37.152
You can't handle your shit by
yourself, huh, tough guy?

01:06:37.185 --> 01:06:39.052
Sir, your son is fucking
with my girlfriend.

01:06:39.085 --> 01:06:40.484
It ain't cool...

01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:45.952
You motherfucker!

01:06:45.985 --> 01:06:48.118
What the fuck!

01:06:48.152 --> 01:06:49.952
What the fuck, Nash,
what the fuck!

01:06:49.985 --> 01:06:51.451
I'm not with you
anymore!

01:06:51.484 --> 01:06:52.818
Fuck you,
you cheated on me!

01:06:52.853 --> 01:06:54.952
No, I didn't, we were never together!
No! No!

01:06:54.985 --> 01:06:57.384
You come to my home,
threaten my son, motherfucker!

01:06:57.418 --> 01:06:59.018
It took three of you to fuck me
up, you're a pussy!

01:06:59.052 --> 01:06:59.985
What are you talking about,

01:07:00.018 --> 01:07:00.952
what do you mean you're
not with him anymore?

01:07:00.985 --> 01:07:01.651
From the
start, I fuckin' said

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.484
I never wanted
to be with you.

01:07:03.518 --> 01:07:05.018
It was like
a casual fucking thing!

01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:06.886
Fuck that shit,
you wanted me.

01:07:06.918 --> 01:07:08.118
You're a little slut.

01:07:08.152 --> 01:07:10.418
You're a fucking slut!

01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:12.685
Hey, don't call my mama
that, what the fuck?

01:07:12.718 --> 01:07:14.085
You ain't
got nothin' to say?

01:07:14.118 --> 01:07:15.018
You come near
my house again,

01:07:15.052 --> 01:07:17.052
you'll be leaving
in a body bag, bitch!

01:07:17.085 --> 01:07:18.785
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:18.819 --> 01:07:20.085
He should
go to the hospital.

01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:21.718
Yeah, maybe you should
go to the hospital?

01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:23.152
No. It's not that bad,

01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:25.451
and plus I don't have
health insurance, anyway,

01:07:25.484 --> 01:07:26.518
but thank you,
Ms. Phan.

01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:28.052
- Okay, now stop movin'.
- All right.

01:07:28.085 --> 01:07:30.152
There's no fighting
in my parking lot.

01:07:30.185 --> 01:07:32.052
He flat-out
sucker-punched me.

01:07:32.085 --> 01:07:34.518
I would have 100%
out-cardio'd that guy.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.451
Fuck.
Sorry for swearing.

01:07:38.985 --> 01:07:40.819
Oh.
Oh, shit, be careful,

01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:42.118
- that's where he kicked me.
- I'm gonna come.

01:07:42.152 --> 01:07:43.418
That's right where
he kicked me.

01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:45.384
That fuckin'
little bitch. Oh.

01:07:45.418 --> 01:07:48.585
Oh, shit.
Ah, am I bleeding out of my head?

01:07:48.618 --> 01:07:50.418
Fuck.

01:07:56.718 --> 01:07:58.451
We're both going to be
hurtin' tomorrow.

01:07:59.185 --> 01:08:00.551
Why is that?

01:08:01.819 --> 01:08:03.885
Let's just say
you're blessed.

01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:05.618
Uh-uh.

01:08:05.651 --> 01:08:08.751
Yeah, I can't believe I'm
attracted to a ginger.

01:08:08.786 --> 01:08:10.718
You're not allowed
to use the G word.

01:08:13.152 --> 01:08:14.418
You have a type?

01:08:14.918 --> 01:08:16.085
Maybe.

01:08:16.118 --> 01:08:17.885
What's your type?

01:08:19.152 --> 01:08:21.018
Let's just say

01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:23.651
- I like men, not boys.
- Mm.

01:08:48.118 --> 01:08:49.685
Oh. Um...

01:08:49.718 --> 01:08:52.984
I'm sorry, I think
I have the wrong house.

01:08:53.018 --> 01:08:54.551
Yeah, 'cause
I saw you parked

01:08:54.585 --> 01:08:56.752
in front of my house
last night, too.

01:08:56.785 --> 01:08:58.917
No, it's... It's a simple mistake.
I'm new in town.

01:08:58.952 --> 01:09:00.952
If I see you around
here again...

01:09:00.984 --> 01:09:02.852
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.719
Honestly,
if shit was different,

01:09:27.885 --> 01:09:30.152
I could take over
the industry with her.

01:09:30.185 --> 01:09:31.417
- Think so?
- Yeah.

01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:33.852
Within six months,
I could see her nabbing Best Newcomer.

01:09:33.885 --> 01:09:35.885
One year and she would
sweep the AVNs.

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:37.484
Tori Black...
You know who Tori Black is?

01:09:37.518 --> 01:09:39.152
Yeah, man, of course,
I know who Tori Black is.

01:09:39.185 --> 01:09:41.051
All right. Well, uh,
she won Performer of the Year

01:09:41.085 --> 01:09:42.719
two years, back to back, right?

01:09:42.751 --> 01:09:44.551
I think that Strawberry's
got the potential.

01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:45.618
I'm not exaggerating,

01:09:45.651 --> 01:09:46.719
- I really believe this.
- Okay.

01:09:46.751 --> 01:09:49.818
I think... I think she could
win three years in a row.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.518
With my guidance,
of course.

01:09:55.518 --> 01:09:57.852
Doesn't matter, I'm stuck
in this shithole anyway.

01:09:59.118 --> 01:10:01.686
Yeah, man, it's gonna be
kind of awkward anyway,

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:02.585
she's gonna have to bang

01:10:02.618 --> 01:10:04.718
all those other fucking guys
on the scene.

01:10:04.751 --> 01:10:06.118
I don't give a fuck.

01:10:06.152 --> 01:10:08.484
I'll be fucking
other bitches, bro.

01:10:08.518 --> 01:10:10.985
Come on.
I think it's hot, I don't care.

01:10:12.451 --> 01:10:14.384
Okay, man.

01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:15.985
I mean, seriously,
it's part of the game.

01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:19.885
- That was nice.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:29.185 --> 01:10:30.785
You want to explain
those bruises?

01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:34.585
I fell off my bike.

01:10:36.185 --> 01:10:37.384
Mm.

01:10:40.852 --> 01:10:42.484
Must've been
a hard fall.

01:10:43.418 --> 01:10:44.652
Mm-hmm.

01:11:03.085 --> 01:11:04.751
This is eight,
I need ten.

01:11:11.619 --> 01:11:13.651
I'm moving a lot of
weight for you guys, huh?

01:11:18.985 --> 01:11:20.818
I like those gold teeth.

01:11:20.852 --> 01:11:23.085
I got one dia...
I got one diamond,

01:11:23.118 --> 01:11:25.551
I had my dentist in Cali
put it in. So...

01:11:28.152 --> 01:11:29.885
Yo, get your ass
out of here, man.

01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:34.085
All right, say hi
to your mom for me.

01:11:56.018 --> 01:11:58.418
These refinery boys
are the best.

01:11:58.451 --> 01:11:59.586
They buy way more weed

01:11:59.618 --> 01:12:02.818
than these skaters and
dancers I got to deal with.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.852
- Dancers?
- Yeah, from the titty bar.

01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:06.384
Oh, strippers.

01:12:06.418 --> 01:12:08.985
They prefer the term
"dancers," young lady.

01:12:09.018 --> 01:12:11.685
- Show some respect.
- Okay.

01:12:11.718 --> 01:12:12.818
Topless dancers.

01:12:12.852 --> 01:12:15.618
Oh, bottomless, too.
They got it all.

01:12:15.651 --> 01:12:17.852
- Really?
- Yeah, what, you never been?

01:12:17.885 --> 01:12:18.818
Well, why would I have been?

01:12:18.852 --> 01:12:21.152
Plus, I'm not even
old enough to get in.

01:12:21.185 --> 01:12:23.651
That's fine.
You want to go?

01:12:23.685 --> 01:12:25.018
Seriously?

01:12:25.052 --> 01:12:26.818
Strip club virgin!

01:12:31.618 --> 01:12:33.152
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:12:33.185 --> 01:12:34.785
- How old is she?
- Eighteen.

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:35.952
Eighteen.

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.451
Twenty bucks.

01:12:38.418 --> 01:12:40.618
You're hotter than
all these girls combined.

01:12:41.718 --> 01:12:43.585
If you worked here,
they'd be out of a job.

01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:46.485
You want to
give her a tip?

01:12:46.519 --> 01:12:47.651
Come on, let's go.
Let's give it to 'em.

01:12:47.685 --> 01:12:48.918
It's fun. Come on.

01:13:23.751 --> 01:13:24.718
Right here.
Right here.

01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:26.518
- Here?
- Yeah, pull in there.

01:13:29.018 --> 01:13:30.585
I just gotta
get some milk.

01:13:34.585 --> 01:13:36.418
All right, well...

01:13:37.452 --> 01:13:39.018
- Good night.
- Oh, I can...

01:13:39.052 --> 01:13:41.085
I can wait and drive
you all the way home.

01:13:41.118 --> 01:13:42.452
Oh, no, it's okay.

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.618
I like to ride my bike
at night.

01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:47.085
Okay.

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:49.518
But, technically,
that was our first date.

01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:52.118
So you just brought me
to a strip joint

01:13:52.152 --> 01:13:54.852
for our first date.
Real classy.

01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:56.551
Ooh, snap.

01:13:56.585 --> 01:13:58.885
Mm. Well, I guess
we got to do it again.

01:13:58.918 --> 01:14:02.518
You want to go to the
pier Friday night?

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:04.452
Beats liver and onions
at Luby's.

01:14:04.484 --> 01:14:06.384
I love Luby's.

01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:12.484
<i>So, friends,</i>

01:14:12.518 --> 01:14:16.518
<i>it is with humility,
determination,</i>

01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:19.952
<i>and boundless confidence
in America's promise...</i>

01:14:20.985 --> 01:14:23.918
<i>...that I accept
your nomination</i>

01:14:23.952 --> 01:14:26.985
<i>for President
of the United States!</i>

01:14:27.018 --> 01:14:28.085
<i>All right,</i>

01:14:28.118 --> 01:14:30.518
<i>Rich Snarkey
is with us in Washington.</i>

01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:33.085
<i>Rich, what are these
new emails revealing?</i>

01:14:33.118 --> 01:14:34.718
Yeah?

01:14:36.451 --> 01:14:38.085
Mm. Yeah?

01:14:38.918 --> 01:14:40.152
Daddy want to play?

01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:42.385
I don't know
if I'm feeling it.

01:14:42.419 --> 01:14:44.618
Oh, I can feel it. Mm.

01:14:45.484 --> 01:14:48.419
Nice and fast.

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:49.818
I just don't think
it's happening today.

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.852
Come on.

01:14:52.551 --> 01:14:54.419
Don't
you want to get in me?

01:14:54.451 --> 01:14:56.952
Don't you want to get
in this tight little pussy.

01:14:56.985 --> 01:14:59.551
I don't feel it, I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling it.

01:14:59.585 --> 01:15:01.985
Jesus Christ.
Okay, okay.

01:15:03.085 --> 01:15:05.385
- What?
- It's fine.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.585
Whatever.
I didn't want to, anyway.

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:24.152
Lonnie!

01:15:25.818 --> 01:15:26.818
Lonnie!

01:15:27.685 --> 01:15:30.885
Lonnie! Lon...
Lonniekins!

01:15:31.885 --> 01:15:32.985
Hey!

01:15:33.018 --> 01:15:35.018
Don't be tied up
all day.

01:15:38.118 --> 01:15:39.651
Hey, Lonniekins.

01:15:39.685 --> 01:15:42.718
- Hey, Lexi, what's up?
- Oh, not much.

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:44.484
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, you know,

01:15:44.518 --> 01:15:45.818
fartin' around
with the old man.

01:15:45.852 --> 01:15:47.985
- Oh, yeah.
- Same shit, different day.

01:15:48.018 --> 01:15:49.685
Oh, I know, I know.

01:15:49.718 --> 01:15:50.585
What are you doin'?

01:15:50.618 --> 01:15:53.018
I'm just, you know,
gettin' some air.

01:15:53.052 --> 01:15:54.320
Some sunshine.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.785
So you and Mikey
been hangin' out, huh?

01:15:57.818 --> 01:16:00.418
Yeah. It's been fun
having him in town.

01:16:00.451 --> 01:16:01.751
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:16:03.085 --> 01:16:05.985
Is he giving you money for all
those rides you're giving him?

01:16:06.018 --> 01:16:07.451
Mm, no.

01:16:07.484 --> 01:16:09.118
I mean, I don't
mind, we're buds.

01:16:09.152 --> 01:16:11.785
I know y'all don't have a set
of wheels right now, so...

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.618
No, we don't,
not right now.

01:16:17.418 --> 01:16:19.451
Yeah, you been working out?

01:16:19.484 --> 01:16:21.052
No.

01:16:21.085 --> 01:16:23.618
- Oh. You look good.
- Thanks.

01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:25.418
You sure you haven't
been working out?

01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:27.052
I'm positive.

01:16:27.085 --> 01:16:28.985
Can't call you "scrawny
Lonnie" no more,

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.718
can I?

01:16:33.618 --> 01:16:35.518
You keep Mikey out of trouble
now, you hear?

01:16:35.551 --> 01:16:37.018
I'll try.

01:16:37.052 --> 01:16:38.985
Okay, I know you will.

01:16:40.952 --> 01:16:41.985
Good seeing you.

01:16:42.018 --> 01:16:43.484
Good seeing you.
Take care.

01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:48.418
There's a lot of rides,

01:16:48.451 --> 01:16:50.418
we could do
the roller-coaster.

01:16:50.451 --> 01:16:51.451
Am I tall enough?

01:16:51.484 --> 01:16:53.785
I think it's, like,
48 inches or whatever.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:55.651
I'll give you 48
inches or whatever.

01:16:56.852 --> 01:16:58.718
I'm sorry.
That was too easy.

01:16:58.751 --> 01:16:59.685
But I got you. It's like,

01:16:59.718 --> 01:17:01.651
if you're scared,
just grab onto me, you know.

01:17:01.685 --> 01:17:03.618
I'll hold your hand.

01:17:03.651 --> 01:17:05.484
So, after this,

01:17:05.518 --> 01:17:07.952
are you gonna fuck me
under the boardwalk?

01:17:07.985 --> 01:17:10.484
You're such a little
exhibitionist, you know that?

01:17:10.518 --> 01:17:11.685
Look who's talking.

01:17:12.484 --> 01:17:13.818
Wait, what do you mean?

01:17:14.585 --> 01:17:16.518
You know what I mean.

01:17:16.551 --> 01:17:18.885
Mr. Saber.

01:17:32.052 --> 01:17:33.618
Oh, my God!

01:17:34.985 --> 01:17:36.952
Mikey!

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.818
The second I broke up
with Nash,

01:17:39.618 --> 01:17:40.685
my Facebook blew up

01:17:40.718 --> 01:17:42.585
with everyone
and their fucking grandma

01:17:42.618 --> 01:17:43.985
sending me links
to your videos.

01:17:46.585 --> 01:17:48.384
And you're cool
with it?

01:17:48.418 --> 01:17:50.551
Would I be here
if I gave a shit?

01:17:50.585 --> 01:17:52.018
I actually think
it's kinda dope.

01:17:52.618 --> 01:17:53.618
Hmm.

01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:57.418
I think it's cool
you just said,

01:17:57.451 --> 01:17:59.085
"Fuck it, I'm gonna get paid

01:17:59.118 --> 01:18:00.918
"for doing
the thing I love most."

01:18:00.952 --> 01:18:03.152
And as long as you're
not hurtin' anybody,

01:18:03.186 --> 01:18:05.384
you do you, man.

01:18:05.418 --> 01:18:06.918
But if you give me something,

01:18:06.952 --> 01:18:08.685
I swear to fuckin' God...

01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:09.718
Us porn folk

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.985
are the most tested people
on the whole planet.

01:18:12.018 --> 01:18:12.985
I mean, think about it,

01:18:13.018 --> 01:18:15.451
we got to get tested to
work, you know?

01:18:15.484 --> 01:18:16.751
Maybe I gave you somethin'?

01:18:16.785 --> 01:18:18.885
Oh, don't even kid!

01:18:21.518 --> 01:18:24.484
I posted a nude online once.

01:18:24.518 --> 01:18:27.085
I can never tell if you're
joking or if you're serious.

01:18:27.118 --> 01:18:29.518
My friends and I
were messing around

01:18:29.551 --> 01:18:32.618
on that subreddit,
Gone Wild.

01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:34.885
We were just trying to see how
much attention we could get.

01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:35.918
We weren't even naked,
we had,

01:18:35.952 --> 01:18:37.885
like, our stuffed animals
like that, you know?

01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:40.685
But this old guy
in Ohio

01:18:40.718 --> 01:18:42.818
propositioned us
to sell a nude pic.

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:45.952
And I did,
and he Venmo'd me 60 bucks.

01:18:45.985 --> 01:18:47.818
- Sixty bucks?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:47.852 --> 01:18:49.718
You're a bad, bad girl.

01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:50.885
But 60 bucks ain't shit.

01:18:50.918 --> 01:18:53.451
You should get
at least double that.

01:18:53.484 --> 01:18:55.785
So were you planning
on ever telling me?

01:18:55.818 --> 01:18:57.451
Yeah.

01:18:57.484 --> 01:18:59.484
It's not something you drop
on a civilian.

01:19:00.852 --> 01:19:02.952
A civilian?
Is that what I am?

01:19:04.153 --> 01:19:05.351
Yeah.

01:19:06.119 --> 01:19:07.518
But you don't have to be.

01:19:08.418 --> 01:19:10.153
For reals?

01:19:10.185 --> 01:19:13.818
Look,
I'm gonna be straight with you.

01:19:13.852 --> 01:19:16.685
I've been in the business
almost 20 years,

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:20.751
and nobody,
nobody comes close to you.

01:19:22.484 --> 01:19:24.885
Straight up, you could be a huge
star, I'm just saying.

01:19:26.418 --> 01:19:28.418
- You're funny.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:29.885 --> 01:19:31.018
Look,

01:19:31.052 --> 01:19:34.086
I'm already about to have
a very awkward senior year.

01:19:34.119 --> 01:19:35.285
Mm.

01:19:35.319 --> 01:19:37.751
I'm not about to have a very
awkward rest of my life.

01:19:37.785 --> 01:19:38.785
Ah.

01:19:58.551 --> 01:19:59.685
...but the second time

01:19:59.718 --> 01:20:01.018
I fell out of the tree,
remember?

01:20:01.053 --> 01:20:03.451
I fell straight down on the
ground and broke my arm,

01:20:03.484 --> 01:20:05.053
so I had a leg broken
and an arm broken.

01:20:05.086 --> 01:20:07.551
And then Mom had to wheel me
around in the shoppin' cart

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:08.618
for, like, a month...

01:20:08.651 --> 01:20:09.685
And you loved that.

01:20:09.718 --> 01:20:10.952
It was so embarrassing.

01:20:10.985 --> 01:20:12.718
- Aw.
- Hey!

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.885
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hmm.

01:20:15.918 --> 01:20:16.952
How you doing?

01:20:16.985 --> 01:20:19.751
I'm good.
What you doin' here?

01:20:19.785 --> 01:20:20.818
Just catchin' up

01:20:20.852 --> 01:20:22.518
- with Lil and Lexi.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.985
Catching up
on some old stuff.

01:20:24.018 --> 01:20:25.718
- Mm-hmm.
- Shootin' the breeze.

01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:26.885
- Sounds like it.
- Yeah.

01:20:26.918 --> 01:20:27.852
You should let me know
next time,

01:20:27.885 --> 01:20:31.484
I'll make some steaks.
Hang out with you guys.

01:20:31.518 --> 01:20:32.852
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

01:20:32.885 --> 01:20:34.818
- Sounds like a plan.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:34.852 --> 01:20:36.585
Ladies,
I'mma get up outta here.

01:20:36.618 --> 01:20:37.952
- It's getting late.
- Oh, no. Already?

01:20:37.985 --> 01:20:39.585
But your
hospitality was good,

01:20:39.618 --> 01:20:41.918
- the conversation was boss.
- Aw.

01:20:41.952 --> 01:20:43.885
- Okay, girls...
- So good to see you.

01:20:43.918 --> 01:20:44.751
Absolutely.

01:20:44.785 --> 01:20:46.551
So good to see you again, Lele.

01:20:46.585 --> 01:20:47.751
- You, too, my baby.
- Please come back.

01:20:47.785 --> 01:20:49.885
- I will. I will.
- Don't be a stranger.

01:20:49.918 --> 01:20:50.952
You take care of yourself,
baby girl.

01:20:50.985 --> 01:20:52.118
- You, too.
- All right?

01:20:52.152 --> 01:20:53.384
Be safe out there.

01:20:53.418 --> 01:20:55.053
Mikey, I'm sure
I'll see you soon.

01:20:55.085 --> 01:20:55.952
Yeah, you will.

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:57.618
- Thanks, Lele.
- Good night.

01:20:57.651 --> 01:20:59.451
- Good night.
- God bless you.

01:21:06.085 --> 01:21:07.585
Did it come through?

01:21:07.618 --> 01:21:09.451
<i>Yeah. Bullshit.</i>

01:21:09.484 --> 01:21:12.551
You see her?
She's fuckin' smokin', right?

01:21:12.585 --> 01:21:14.651
You're not gonna
believe this, dude.

01:21:14.685 --> 01:21:17.019
- Her name is Strawberry.
- <i>What?</i>

01:21:17.052 --> 01:21:18.085
Fucking Strawberry.

01:21:18.118 --> 01:21:19.451
You can't make
this shit up, man.

01:21:19.484 --> 01:21:20.384
- <i>Strawberry?</i>
- Yeah. No, I...

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:22.751
Has there even been
a Strawberry before?

01:21:22.785 --> 01:21:25.618
She's my way back
in, man, I'm tellin' you.

01:21:25.651 --> 01:21:29.019
This is like a Jenna Jameson,
Sasha Grey-level find here.

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:31.518
Aw, fuck, I'm blessed,
I'm so fucking blessed.

01:21:31.551 --> 01:21:33.885
See, this is my talent,

01:21:33.918 --> 01:21:35.785
I could be a badass scout.

01:21:35.818 --> 01:21:38.685
I got my finger on the pulse
of the next generation, baby.

01:21:39.918 --> 01:21:41.484
How do you know she's
gonna be down for this, man?

01:21:41.518 --> 01:21:44.451
Oh, she's down,
trust me, she's down.

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:47.651
Plus, she sucks on my fingers
while I'm fucking her, bro.

01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:48.618
Oh, yeah? That's cool.

01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:51.384
Yeah, it's cool.
You know what that means?

01:21:51.418 --> 01:21:52.451
She likes fingers?

01:21:52.484 --> 01:21:54.052
You're so cute.

01:21:55.518 --> 01:21:57.451
Means she likes
having a dick in her mouth

01:21:57.484 --> 01:22:00.018
while getting fucked.
It's a telltale sign, bro.

01:22:00.052 --> 01:22:01.185
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:22:01.219 --> 01:22:03.152
Any time a girl puts something
in her mouth while fucking,

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:04.986
either they're familiar
with that scenario

01:22:05.018 --> 01:22:06.953
or they're intrigued
by that scenario.

01:22:06.986 --> 01:22:08.852
Think about it, man,
it's just logic.

01:22:08.885 --> 01:22:10.451
I never thought
about it that way.

01:22:10.484 --> 01:22:12.484
Yeah, man,
no, that's what Lexi did.

01:22:12.518 --> 01:22:13.919
You know,
when we first started dating,

01:22:13.953 --> 01:22:16.052
Lexi would suck on my fingers
while I was fucking her.

01:22:16.085 --> 01:22:17.718
That's what schooled me
to the knowledge

01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:18.785
that she'd slept with

01:22:18.818 --> 01:22:20.418
more than one dude
at a time before.

01:22:20.451 --> 01:22:22.018
So when I proposed
a threesome, she was in.

01:22:22.052 --> 01:22:24.052
She didn't fight it,
she fucking loved it.

01:22:24.085 --> 01:22:25.351
- Huh.
- Yeah.

01:22:27.685 --> 01:22:28.685
Well, what do you think

01:22:28.718 --> 01:22:31.052
Lexi is gonna think
about all of this, though?

01:22:31.085 --> 01:22:34.118
Dude, Lexi is the bane
of my fucking existence, man.

01:22:34.152 --> 01:22:36.685
Everything that has gone wrong
in my life the last 15 years

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.651
pretty much
stems back to her.

01:22:39.919 --> 01:22:42.018
I've forgiven her
over and over again.

01:22:42.052 --> 01:22:44.018
I've overlooked so much shit
in the name of forgiveness,

01:22:44.052 --> 01:22:45.852
but it doesn't matter,
she always fucks me...

01:22:46.953 --> 01:22:48.451
Hey, how you doin', sir?

01:22:53.518 --> 01:22:55.618
Go look up the Lexi Lane,
Ashley Blue gangbang.

01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:56.818
At the end,
I'm fucking Ashley,

01:22:56.852 --> 01:22:58.484
so I wasn't paying attention.

01:22:58.518 --> 01:23:01.052
Lexi starts badmouthing me
to the male talent on camera.

01:23:01.085 --> 01:23:02.118
Saying that I'm limp dick
and shit,

01:23:02.152 --> 01:23:03.384
and that's
a total fucking lie.

01:23:03.418 --> 01:23:04.418
Of course
I can get it up, right?

01:23:04.451 --> 01:23:06.618
I didn't know this until
the fucking DVD came out.

01:23:06.651 --> 01:23:08.018
I wanted to knock
that bitch out.

01:23:08.052 --> 01:23:09.952
Anyway, don't say shit.
That stays between us.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:11.751
- I got you, brother.
- You got the next set.

01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:16.551
- Appreciate you.
- Thank you.

01:23:18.152 --> 01:23:20.651
So... I joined
your Pornhub page.

01:23:21.818 --> 01:23:23.551
You watching my scenes?

01:23:23.585 --> 01:23:24.818
Checked out a few.

01:23:24.853 --> 01:23:27.451
I watched the one
you won Best Oral for.

01:23:27.484 --> 01:23:30.152
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:23:30.185 --> 01:23:32.651
Not that it's not hot watchin'
you, but, like...

01:23:33.185 --> 01:23:34.252
Yeah?

01:23:34.285 --> 01:23:38.551
So the girl,
plus all the guys she's blowin'...

01:23:41.152 --> 01:23:42.886
Hello, Mr. Mikey.

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:44.818
Hey, Ms. Phan.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.085
Uh, I swept outside and
watered the plants for you.

01:23:47.118 --> 01:23:48.118
Great.

01:23:51.451 --> 01:23:55.118
So the girl, plus all the guys
she's blowin', win the award?

01:23:55.152 --> 01:23:56.384
Right.

01:23:56.418 --> 01:23:57.985
But we all share it,
the award.

01:23:58.018 --> 01:23:59.952
Okay. But, like,

01:23:59.985 --> 01:24:02.052
she's on her knees
blowing a line of guys,

01:24:02.085 --> 01:24:03.484
it's like her scene.

01:24:03.518 --> 01:24:05.384
Why are you winning
an award for it?

01:24:05.418 --> 01:24:07.418
Okay, well,
that's up for discussion.

01:24:08.718 --> 01:24:10.152
Anyway, you shouldn't
be watching that stuff.

01:24:10.185 --> 01:24:12.118
You know,
just pretend it doesn't exist.

01:24:12.152 --> 01:24:13.819
Don't watch that stuff,
it's not good.

01:24:14.618 --> 01:24:15.885
I'm sorry.

01:24:15.918 --> 01:24:17.819
- Did I hurt your feelings?
- No. It's okay.

01:24:19.185 --> 01:24:20.651
Sorry, I should have asked

01:24:20.685 --> 01:24:22.118
if it was okay
if I watched.

01:24:22.152 --> 01:24:23.685
Hmm.

01:24:25.786 --> 01:24:27.451
Well,
if you do want to watch one,

01:24:27.484 --> 01:24:29.885
check out <i>The Fast and
the Furious</i> parody I did.

01:24:29.918 --> 01:24:31.718
- Are you serious?
- Hell yeah.

01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:34.718
<i>Fast and the Fury-ass.</i>

01:24:34.751 --> 01:24:35.852
- Yeah.
- I love it.

01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:36.952
Clever, right?

01:24:36.985 --> 01:24:39.918
I play Brian O'Conner,
that's Paul Walker's character.

01:24:39.952 --> 01:24:41.985
Man, my acting was next level.
Seriously.

01:24:42.018 --> 01:24:44.651
I mean, my scenes were miles
above the other scenes.

01:24:44.685 --> 01:24:45.985
To this day, people
will tweet me and be like,

01:24:46.018 --> 01:24:47.918
"Oh, you were
the perfect O'Conner."

01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:50.484
I was actually even
nominated for that role.

01:24:50.518 --> 01:24:53.052
Best Supporting Actor
in a Parody.

01:24:53.085 --> 01:24:55.751
But I didn't win.
It was the big snub of the night.

01:24:55.786 --> 01:24:58.451
There was boos and everything.
It was crazy.

01:24:58.484 --> 01:25:01.518
And then Paul Walker goes
and gets himself killed,

01:25:01.551 --> 01:25:02.818
which is such a bummer

01:25:02.852 --> 01:25:05.585
because then I'm fucked
out of the sequels.

01:25:05.618 --> 01:25:06.885
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

01:25:07.818 --> 01:25:08.618
So...

01:25:11.152 --> 01:25:12.818
You want to come over
this weekend?

01:25:14.418 --> 01:25:15.818
Come over?
What, to your place?

01:25:15.852 --> 01:25:17.918
Yeah. We can spend
Saturday night there.

01:25:17.952 --> 01:25:19.152
Uh... Nah, nah,
I'm not into

01:25:19.185 --> 01:25:21.118
the whole
meet-the-parents thing.

01:25:21.152 --> 01:25:22.952
You think I'd introduce you
to my mom?

01:25:22.985 --> 01:25:25.651
Are you fucking kidding me?
No. God, no! No.

01:25:25.685 --> 01:25:28.551
She'll be out of town.
She got a new boyfriend,

01:25:28.585 --> 01:25:30.952
and they're going to Houston
to fuck themselves silly.

01:25:30.985 --> 01:25:33.451
So, we got the place
to our own,

01:25:33.484 --> 01:25:35.085
to fuck ourselves
even sillier.

01:25:36.518 --> 01:25:37.518
Ah!

01:25:41.551 --> 01:25:42.719
- Mikey?
- Yeah?

01:25:44.118 --> 01:25:46.351
You haven't even asked
about Eric once.

01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:50.752
You got my Facebook
message when it happened.

01:25:50.785 --> 01:25:51.852
We chatted.

01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:58.985
My heart goes out to you.
It was a terrible thing.

01:26:05.052 --> 01:26:06.618
So...

01:26:06.651 --> 01:26:09.384
Any word on you getting
custody or whatever?

01:26:11.852 --> 01:26:12.852
Yeah.

01:26:13.785 --> 01:26:15.351
Well, I was thinking...

01:26:16.518 --> 01:26:18.686
I have a meetin'
with CPS next week.

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:21.918
And I was thinking
you could come with me

01:26:21.952 --> 01:26:24.719
and we could tell
the case worker...

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:25.751
Her name is Mary-Anne,

01:26:25.785 --> 01:26:28.785
she's real nice and she's
trying to help me out.

01:26:28.818 --> 01:26:32.018
And we can tell her about how
things are going well here

01:26:32.052 --> 01:26:33.052
and, you know...

01:26:34.451 --> 01:26:36.686
Like you and me,
and all...

01:26:39.518 --> 01:26:40.719
'Cause, I mean,

01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:43.418
if things are going well
with you and me and all,

01:26:43.451 --> 01:26:44.952
and I can get
a clean test...

01:26:44.985 --> 01:26:46.351
And that's gonna happen?

01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:48.285
No wonder they took him,

01:26:48.319 --> 01:26:50.384
you're right back to where you
were in '08 all over again.

01:26:52.585 --> 01:26:54.052
Where's his dad
in all this shit anyway?

01:26:54.085 --> 01:26:56.484
Why doesn't he step
the fuck up? Seriously.

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:01.484
Or better yet,
why doesn't Leondria go with you,

01:27:01.518 --> 01:27:03.751
being that she's so concerned
with our fucking business.

01:27:05.418 --> 01:27:07.418
You know what,
fuck this place.

01:27:07.451 --> 01:27:09.351
I'm going to go watch TV
with your mom.

01:27:41.185 --> 01:27:43.085
Don't judge, okay?

01:27:43.118 --> 01:27:44.852
Why would I do that?

01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:47.118
You're talking to a boy
who grew up in Texas City,

01:27:47.152 --> 01:27:49.018
so I'm not going
to judge anything.

01:27:49.052 --> 01:27:51.586
- This is it?
- Yeah.

01:27:51.619 --> 01:27:54.619
Oh. Uh, I take it back,
this place is a shithole.

01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:55.885
Can you take me
home, please?

01:27:59.586 --> 01:28:00.818
All right, ta-da.

01:28:00.852 --> 01:28:02.885
- Wow. Luxurious.
- Yeah.

01:28:02.918 --> 01:28:04.518
Can't smoke in here,
by the way,

01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:06.484
- my mom's trying to quit.
- That's okay.

01:28:08.952 --> 01:28:10.651
- Is this you?
- Yeah.

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:12.152
That's the first selfie
I ever took.

01:28:12.185 --> 01:28:14.052
- Mm.
- Vintage.

01:28:14.085 --> 01:28:15.685
- You want a Coke?
- Yes.

01:28:17.018 --> 01:28:18.885
And that's your mom?

01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:22.418
Yep. And that's my
grandma, and that's me.

01:28:22.451 --> 01:28:24.586
And that's me.
And that's me.

01:28:24.618 --> 01:28:25.651
Cute.

01:28:25.685 --> 01:28:26.718
What's back here?

01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:27.885
- Ah, that's my mom's room.
- Oh.

01:28:27.918 --> 01:28:29.085
I am right here.

01:28:33.952 --> 01:28:35.918
Wow. Wow.

01:28:36.718 --> 01:28:37.718
Pink.

01:28:38.552 --> 01:28:39.552
Pink.

01:28:39.586 --> 01:28:41.384
It's supposed to make you
happy or something.

01:28:41.418 --> 01:28:42.418
Yeah.

01:28:43.586 --> 01:28:44.785
Wow.

01:28:50.985 --> 01:28:53.384
So, tell your mom
I'm moving in.

01:28:58.418 --> 01:28:59.885
You feel the sunshine?

01:29:02.985 --> 01:29:04.585
By the way,
what sign are you?

01:29:06.651 --> 01:29:07.852
Why?

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:11.152
Uh... I mean,
I don't even believe in astrology,

01:29:11.185 --> 01:29:12.552
but I'm just asking.

01:29:14.018 --> 01:29:15.418
A bad sign.

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:18.552
I don't believe
in that shit, either.

01:29:18.585 --> 01:29:19.585
Yeah.

01:29:26.785 --> 01:29:28.718
You know, before this
place was about black gold,

01:29:28.751 --> 01:29:29.985
it was about black ivory.

01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:32.384
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29:32.418 --> 01:29:34.152
I don't understand.

01:29:34.185 --> 01:29:36.384
- Slave trade, silly.
- Oh.

01:29:36.418 --> 01:29:37.918
Slaves were sold here.

01:29:37.952 --> 01:29:41.618
Some, like, famous
French pirate ran the show.

01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:44.085
A French pirate?
I bet he had really good style.

01:29:44.118 --> 01:29:46.085
I bet he dressed good.

01:29:46.118 --> 01:29:48.852
When I was little,
my mama would take me out here

01:29:48.885 --> 01:29:50.785
and we'd go hunting
for pirate booty.

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:51.852
Ooh.

01:29:51.885 --> 01:29:53.618
- I love pirate booty.
- Ooh.

01:29:53.651 --> 01:29:55.551
Tell me more.

01:29:57.818 --> 01:29:59.985
I'm coming to get ya.

01:30:01.418 --> 01:30:02.985
Fuck!

01:30:15.518 --> 01:30:18.785
This is prime Texas beef
right here.

01:30:18.818 --> 01:30:21.918
This might be the one thing
this place has above LA.

01:30:21.952 --> 01:30:24.018
Besides you, of course.

01:30:24.052 --> 01:30:27.751
You're like an
extraterrestrial around here.

01:30:27.785 --> 01:30:30.952
When I look at you,
I don't think Gulf Coast,

01:30:30.985 --> 01:30:33.384
you know...
Well, besides the sexy drawl.

01:30:33.419 --> 01:30:35.052
You jerk.
It's not that bad.

01:30:35.085 --> 01:30:36.518
It's pretty bad.

01:30:36.551 --> 01:30:37.852
Stop makin' fun of me.

01:30:37.885 --> 01:30:40.551
I'm not.
I had one, but I lost it,

01:30:40.585 --> 01:30:43.818
after living in LA for a
while, you lose it.

01:30:43.852 --> 01:30:46.384
I remember being at work
when I first got there,

01:30:46.419 --> 01:30:47.818
these guys made fun of me
'cause I was like,

01:30:47.852 --> 01:30:48.952
"Hi, I'm Mikey."

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:51.585
And they all said,
"You sound like a dumb hick."

01:30:51.618 --> 01:30:53.384
So, yeah, just lost it.

01:30:54.452 --> 01:30:55.785
Well,

01:30:55.818 --> 01:30:57.551
another year or so
and I'm out of here.

01:30:58.685 --> 01:31:02.118
- Why wait?
- I told you. Moolah.

01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:04.085
I didn't have any money
when I left.

01:31:04.118 --> 01:31:07.985
I have no friends.
No connections.

01:31:08.018 --> 01:31:11.085
I'll be your friend.
I'll be your connection.

01:31:11.118 --> 01:31:12.618
Don't fuck with me.

01:31:13.018 --> 01:31:13.885
I'm not.

01:31:32.152 --> 01:31:34.419
- This is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

01:31:35.451 --> 01:31:37.885
Hold up.
I got an idea.

01:31:42.118 --> 01:31:43.585
Whoa,
what are you doing?

01:31:43.618 --> 01:31:46.918
Let's shoot a scene, for us.
Just for us.

01:31:48.952 --> 01:31:51.818
All right, but if we do that,
we're using my phone.

01:31:52.785 --> 01:31:54.018
Why, you don't trust me?

01:31:54.052 --> 01:31:56.785
Well, you could lose
your phone, motherfucker.

01:31:56.818 --> 01:31:58.885
You could lose your phone,
motherfucker.

01:31:58.918 --> 01:32:01.918
- Well, then it would be on me.
- Mm, true dat.

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:05.085
Look at that, look at that.

01:32:05.118 --> 01:32:07.551
You see that, you see
how good you look?

01:32:08.918 --> 01:32:11.718
You film here, take it.
Take it.

01:32:11.751 --> 01:32:13.585
Mm-hmm.

01:32:13.618 --> 01:32:15.018
Yeah.

01:32:19.651 --> 01:32:21.918
- That's so hot.
- I know.

01:32:21.952 --> 01:32:23.785
You're telling me.

01:32:23.818 --> 01:32:25.685
Look at that,
look at that,

01:32:25.718 --> 01:32:27.818
you know how to play to
the camera and everything.

01:32:29.518 --> 01:32:32.384
You see how you make sure
your face is always seen

01:32:32.418 --> 01:32:33.718
and you're aware
of the camera?

01:32:34.918 --> 01:32:37.551
That's skill right there.
That's crazy.

01:32:38.718 --> 01:32:40.852
If this doesn't show you
that you can be a star,

01:32:40.885 --> 01:32:42.852
I don't know what will.

01:32:42.885 --> 01:32:45.018
- You really think so?
- I know so.

01:32:45.751 --> 01:32:47.085
Hmm.

01:32:47.118 --> 01:32:49.484
I'm not into that
swinger stuff though.

01:32:50.685 --> 01:32:52.152
- Swinger stuff?
- Yeah.

01:32:52.185 --> 01:32:54.052
I like fucking you,

01:32:54.085 --> 01:32:55.918
and I don't want to fuck
anybody else.

01:32:55.952 --> 01:32:59.018
And I don't want to think
about you fucking other girls.

01:33:00.185 --> 01:33:02.384
It'll be just us.

01:33:02.418 --> 01:33:04.618
It's called
"couple scenes."

01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:06.918
It'll be exclusive,
just me and you.

01:33:06.952 --> 01:33:09.618
Getting paid to do
what we just did.

01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:11.518
Shit, you would
have made $2,000

01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:13.751
- for that video right there.
- Mm.

01:33:13.785 --> 01:33:15.785
- How many times did you come?
- Three times.

01:33:15.818 --> 01:33:18.985
You would have been paid two
grand to come three times.

01:33:19.018 --> 01:33:20.052
I'm not
that good at math,

01:33:20.085 --> 01:33:21.685
but that's
a really good deal.

01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:25.785
I have to
sleep on it,

01:33:25.818 --> 01:33:28.085
but it's not like I don't
already have the porn star name.

01:33:28.118 --> 01:33:29.918
Right?

01:33:33.018 --> 01:33:34.018
You play?

01:33:34.718 --> 01:33:36.384
No, I eat off of it.

01:33:36.418 --> 01:33:37.718
- You're such a smart-ass.
- Yeah.

01:33:37.751 --> 01:33:39.952
Yeah, since I was six.

01:33:41.952 --> 01:33:43.585
You going
to play me something?

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.852
- Gonna make me?
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.

01:33:45.885 --> 01:33:46.952

01:35:29.551 --> 01:35:30.718
Where were you?

01:35:33.685 --> 01:35:36.418
I texted you.
I was gone for the weekend.

01:35:37.985 --> 01:35:39.985
I know.

01:35:44.685 --> 01:35:46.518
That's not my question.

01:35:47.918 --> 01:35:49.018
Where were you?

01:35:51.918 --> 01:35:53.484
You serious right now?

01:35:53.518 --> 01:35:54.985
Yeah,
I'm fuckin' serious.

01:35:56.185 --> 01:35:57.153
I was in this
cute little town

01:35:57.185 --> 01:35:59.085
called none of your
fuckin' business Texas.

01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:00.952
How about
that's where I was.

01:36:00.985 --> 01:36:02.451
- Oh, were ya?
- Yeah.

01:36:03.418 --> 01:36:04.618
That sounds like
a lot of fun.

01:36:04.651 --> 01:36:05.952
I hope you had
a good fuckin' time!

01:36:08.518 --> 01:36:10.785
What the fuck was that, huh?
Huh? Huh?

01:36:10.818 --> 01:36:11.852
Get your fuckin' hands
off me!

01:36:11.885 --> 01:36:13.751
Hey, Lil,
come get your daughter!

01:36:13.785 --> 01:36:15.852
- Huh?
- Mikey, go fuck yourself!

01:36:15.885 --> 01:36:18.052
Okay. Look!
Look! Look! Look!

01:36:19.618 --> 01:36:21.451
I was makin' us
money, okay?

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:24.551
I had to go down to Corpus
Christi to pick up some shit.

01:36:24.585 --> 01:36:26.651
- For us!
- Oh, I don't believe you!

01:36:26.685 --> 01:36:28.052
- You don't believe me?
- I don't fuckin' believe you!

01:36:28.086 --> 01:36:29.551
You don't believe me?

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:32.451
Huh?

01:36:32.484 --> 01:36:35.052
Four weeks ago,
I had zip, huh.

01:36:35.086 --> 01:36:37.618
Now I got 3K!
Look at it!

01:36:37.651 --> 01:36:38.651
Give me a fucking break!

01:36:38.685 --> 01:36:40.451
When was the last time
you had money like that

01:36:40.484 --> 01:36:41.618
under your
fucking roof, huh?

01:36:41.651 --> 01:36:44.152
Now, if you want me to keep
paying for rent and food,

01:36:44.185 --> 01:36:45.718
shut the fuck up!

01:36:45.751 --> 01:36:47.685
And I'm not cleaning
that shit up, either!

01:36:57.451 --> 01:37:00.384
She's in, man.
She's fuckin' in!

01:37:00.418 --> 01:37:01.685
- Yeah? She's in?
- Yeah.

01:37:01.718 --> 01:37:03.985
I'm still ironing out
the details, but guaranteed,

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:06.985
I'll have her shooting scenes
by September, baby!

01:37:07.018 --> 01:37:08.852
That's pretty impressive
though, man.

01:37:08.885 --> 01:37:11.384
Three weeks, you convinced
a girl to do porn?

01:37:11.418 --> 01:37:13.451
Like, what the fuck.

01:37:13.484 --> 01:37:15.118
I couldn't convince
my first girlfriend

01:37:15.152 --> 01:37:17.685
to give me a blowjob
for three fucking years.

01:37:17.718 --> 01:37:18.852
Hey, man,

01:37:18.885 --> 01:37:22.952
what can I say, baby,
I'm good at what I do. Ha-ha!

01:37:22.985 --> 01:37:24.818
So that means
you're going to be leaving?

01:37:24.852 --> 01:37:26.685
Yeah, I'm leaving.

01:37:26.718 --> 01:37:28.918
Well, when are you leaving?

01:37:28.952 --> 01:37:30.751
Basically,
I need enough to float us

01:37:30.785 --> 01:37:31.985
until she starts shootin'.

01:37:32.019 --> 01:37:34.751
I'm thinkin' I could have that
by the end of August, easy.

01:37:34.785 --> 01:37:36.952
Dude, it's going to suck
for you to go.

01:37:36.985 --> 01:37:38.685
I know, man,
it's going to suck

01:37:38.718 --> 01:37:40.651
not hanging with you,
anymore, Lonnie.

01:37:40.685 --> 01:37:42.651
You're my guy!
But, dude,

01:37:42.685 --> 01:37:44.053
I'm on top of my game
right now,

01:37:44.085 --> 01:37:46.085
on, like, every single
possible level.

01:37:46.118 --> 01:37:48.651
Physical stamina,
my mind is sharp.

01:37:48.685 --> 01:37:49.618
Now that I'm making money,

01:37:49.651 --> 01:37:52.418
I'm taking 5-HTP
for serotonin in my brain.

01:37:52.451 --> 01:37:54.585
Dude,
with my skill and ability

01:37:54.618 --> 01:37:55.918
and my eidetic memory shit,

01:37:55.952 --> 01:37:57.551
there's no denying
what I could do.

01:37:57.585 --> 01:37:59.618
The universe
is on my side, bro.

01:37:59.651 --> 01:38:00.718
Yeah?

01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:03.618
Saber Entertainment's
first signed contract girl.

01:38:03.651 --> 01:38:05.585
Strawberry!
Huh? You like that?

01:38:05.618 --> 01:38:06.585
I do, yeah.

01:38:06.618 --> 01:38:08.818
Just Strawberry.
No need for anything fancy,

01:38:08.852 --> 01:38:10.585
all the biggest celebrities
have one name.

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:11.986
Cher. Prince. Madonna.

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:14.118
Ooh, I'm getting a LLC
for Saber Entertainment.

01:38:14.152 --> 01:38:16.651
- Yeah?
- I had a DBA for Mikey Saber,

01:38:16.685 --> 01:38:19.384
but, uh, I didn't pay my annual
fees, so it expired,

01:38:19.418 --> 01:38:21.551
and I had a falling out
with my old business partner.

01:38:21.585 --> 01:38:23.685
But I do have
Mike Saber trademarked.

01:38:23.718 --> 01:38:24.852
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

01:38:24.885 --> 01:38:27.018
Oh, it's going to be a big
announcement at AdultCon, bro.

01:38:27.052 --> 01:38:28.885
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.

01:38:28.918 --> 01:38:30.118
You know what,
this small-town life,

01:38:30.152 --> 01:38:31.252
it just ain't for me, man.

01:38:31.285 --> 01:38:34.052
No offense. But, like,
I'm a big-city guy, you know.

01:38:34.085 --> 01:38:36.052
Dude, if you want, I can
hook you up with Leondria

01:38:36.085 --> 01:38:37.585
so you can have
my clientele.

01:38:37.618 --> 01:38:38.818
- Hell yeah!
- Yeah.

01:38:38.852 --> 01:38:40.618
I just don't want you
selling fuckin' flags

01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:41.953
for the rest of your life,
you know what I mean?

01:38:41.986 --> 01:38:43.052
Oh, here's the exit
right here, bro!

01:38:43.085 --> 01:38:45.918
Fuck! Shit! What the fuck!

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.818
Dude, we're fucked,
dude, we're fucked!

01:38:47.852 --> 01:38:49.418
I fuckin' know, man.

01:38:49.451 --> 01:38:51.052
We're fucked!
We're fucked!

01:38:51.085 --> 01:38:52.484
Oh, my God, Lonnie,

01:38:52.518 --> 01:38:54.685
why'd you fuckin' pull off
like that, man?

01:38:54.718 --> 01:38:55.751
I didn't do
anything, man,

01:38:55.785 --> 01:38:56.818
I just fuckin'
took the turn

01:38:56.852 --> 01:38:58.751
like you fuckin'
asked me to, man!

01:38:58.785 --> 01:39:00.751
Stop the car, man.
Stop the fucking car.

01:39:00.785 --> 01:39:02.919
Stop the fucking car! Stop!

01:39:04.718 --> 01:39:05.852
Where you going?

01:39:07.585 --> 01:39:09.418
Crap! Fuck!

Look. I've been doing

- You got a car?
- Oh, I mean get a taxi.

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:46.618
I'm gonna have
a taxi pick us up

01:48:46.651 --> 01:48:47.852
and take us
to the station,

01:48:47.885 --> 01:48:50.818
and we're taking a bus
to Hollywood, baby.

01:48:51.618 --> 01:48:53.085
- Okay.
- So just be packed

01:48:53.118 --> 01:48:55.018
and ready to go at 10:00,
but just bring one bag,

01:48:55.052 --> 01:48:56.085
'cause when we get to LA,

01:48:56.118 --> 01:48:57.952
we're going to buy
all new shit.

01:49:01.018 --> 01:49:02.685
- Mikey?
- Yeah?

01:49:04.685 --> 01:49:05.952
You make me so happy.

01:49:16.985 --> 01:49:18.085
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:49:21.518 --> 01:49:22.551
Mm-hmm.

01:49:32.618 --> 01:49:34.685
- Is Lil here? She's...
- She's sleeping.

01:49:45.885 --> 01:49:48.085
Uh...

01:49:51.085 --> 01:49:52.585
It's been
a crazy month, huh?

01:49:53.451 --> 01:49:55.085
Sure has.

01:49:55.118 --> 01:49:56.152
Poor Lonnie.

01:49:56.185 --> 01:49:57.985
- Oh, God, so sad.
- So fucked up.

01:49:59.818 --> 01:50:02.085
- I hope he's all right.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:50:04.585 --> 01:50:05.585
Uh...

01:50:06.952 --> 01:50:09.052
Yeah, it's just
been so wild,

01:50:09.085 --> 01:50:10.818
we've been fighting
and all that stuff.

01:50:13.484 --> 01:50:14.484
Yeah.

01:50:15.685 --> 01:50:17.418
I'm not...
I'm not really in the mood.

01:50:17.451 --> 01:50:18.585
Huh?

01:50:18.618 --> 01:50:20.152
I'm not really in the mood
to mess around.

01:50:20.185 --> 01:50:21.484
Oh.

01:50:21.518 --> 01:50:22.751
- Yeah.
- Just saying.

01:50:22.785 --> 01:50:23.885
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:50:26.751 --> 01:50:27.618
Just been fighting a lot,

01:50:27.651 --> 01:50:29.785
been a lot of drama
lately. And, uh...

01:50:33.918 --> 01:50:35.718
We don't want to fight,
you know what I mean.

01:50:37.451 --> 01:50:39.384
I know you don't want that.
I don't want that.

01:50:42.818 --> 01:50:43.818
So...

01:50:44.751 --> 01:50:45.751
Yeah.

01:50:48.751 --> 01:50:49.952
Look, I'm...

01:50:51.852 --> 01:50:52.885
I'm just gonna tell ya,

01:50:52.918 --> 01:50:54.918
I'm going back to
California in the morning.

01:50:58.952 --> 01:50:59.985
So...

01:51:04.785 --> 01:51:06.085
- I mean...
- You're going back

01:51:06.118 --> 01:51:07.818
- to California.
- Yeah.

01:51:09.018 --> 01:51:10.451
I got some work,

01:51:11.751 --> 01:51:13.718
so that's good.
And...

01:51:15.018 --> 01:51:16.451
Uh...

01:51:18.818 --> 01:51:22.152
You know, this has not
been going good with us.

01:51:22.186 --> 01:51:24.618
It's so much drama,
throwing coffee pots.

01:51:24.651 --> 01:51:26.751
We don't need that,
you know. And...

01:51:27.785 --> 01:51:29.551
But this has been fun.

01:51:29.585 --> 01:51:31.085
You know, we had some good times.
I know...

01:51:34.451 --> 01:51:35.952
Just feels like, uh...

01:51:35.985 --> 01:51:38.818
Just feels like it's time to
go, you know?

01:51:38.852 --> 01:51:42.052
I'm sure Lil's ready for me to go.
I...

01:51:44.153 --> 01:51:45.351
Yeah.

01:51:48.985 --> 01:51:50.018
I don't want
to fight with you,

01:51:50.052 --> 01:51:51.085
you know what I mean,

01:51:51.118 --> 01:51:53.052
but we had good times,
as always.

01:51:53.085 --> 01:51:55.685
And thank you
for the hospitality.

01:51:57.018 --> 01:51:59.585
It's been great.
So...

01:52:02.418 --> 01:52:04.418
You know, I wanted to
tell you and Lil together,

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:06.918
but I guess I could just
tell her in the morning,

01:52:06.952 --> 01:52:09.153
before I go.
Or if I...

01:52:09.186 --> 01:52:10.885
I don't see her,
I can...

01:52:10.918 --> 01:52:13.484
I'll call her or something,
and thank her. But...

01:52:16.985 --> 01:52:18.384
So I'm gonna go to bed.

01:52:27.618 --> 01:52:29.451
Okay? We're good?

01:52:30.119 --> 01:52:31.384
You understand.

01:54:51.019 --> 01:54:53.551
Aw, look at
this cutie pie.

01:54:53.585 --> 01:54:54.651
Aw.

01:54:54.685 --> 01:54:55.986
Hey, yo, B,
hit the light.

01:54:56.019 --> 01:54:57.718
Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey!

01:54:59.152 --> 01:55:01.918
- Yo!
- Ahh! Ah, what the fuck!

01:55:03.518 --> 01:55:04.685
Oh, look out, it's me!

01:55:04.718 --> 01:55:06.618
Look at this scared
motherfucker, man.

01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:07.986
June?

01:55:08.651 --> 01:55:09.918
It's me, homeboy.

01:55:09.953 --> 01:55:11.118
- What the fuck?
- That's right.

01:55:12.618 --> 01:55:14.718
What...
What are you doing here?

01:55:14.751 --> 01:55:16.751
Money. Weed.

01:55:16.785 --> 01:55:19.052
Get your shit
and get the fuck out!

01:55:19.085 --> 01:55:20.651
June, what the fuck,
I'm good with your mama.

01:55:20.685 --> 01:55:21.918
What are you talking about?
I'm not giving you shit.

01:55:21.953 --> 01:55:24.451
You good with my mama?
Yeah, nah. See...

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:26.585
This is your eviction
notice, Mikey.

01:55:26.618 --> 01:55:28.118
I don't think
you got the message.

01:55:28.152 --> 01:55:29.953
No, wait, what the fuck
are you talking about?

01:55:29.986 --> 01:55:31.785
- I'm good with your mama...
- She sent us here.

01:55:31.818 --> 01:55:33.518
Give me my phone,
I'm calling Leondria.

01:55:33.551 --> 01:55:34.785
That shit's not an option.

01:55:34.818 --> 01:55:35.718
Where the hell
the money at?

01:55:35.751 --> 01:55:37.018
No, fuck you,
I'm not giving you shit!

01:55:37.052 --> 01:55:37.919
- Fuck me?
- I'm not telling you

01:55:37.953 --> 01:55:39.885
- where my fucking money is.
- Fuck me?

01:55:39.919 --> 01:55:41.618
- It's under the mattress!
- Yo, go ahead.

01:55:43.685 --> 01:55:45.018
What the hell
are you doing?

01:55:45.052 --> 01:55:46.785
- Damn!
- What the fuck!

01:55:46.818 --> 01:55:48.052
- What are you doing, man?
- What the fuck, man!

01:55:48.085 --> 01:55:49.118
Motherfucker's naked!

01:55:49.152 --> 01:55:50.919
The money's
under the mattress!

01:55:50.953 --> 01:55:52.919
Shut the fuck up!
What are you doing? No!

01:55:52.953 --> 01:55:54.384
On the other side,
it's under the mattress.

01:55:54.418 --> 01:55:55.319
Go and get that, B.

01:55:55.351 --> 01:55:57.384
This motherfucker
is layin' on the bed.

01:55:57.418 --> 01:55:58.585
Get that money!
Get that money!

01:55:58.618 --> 01:55:59.651
What are you doing?

01:55:59.685 --> 01:56:00.885
I'm sorry, Mikey.

01:56:00.919 --> 01:56:02.852
Don't! Stop! Stop!

01:56:05.651 --> 01:56:07.952
That's my money!
Hey, that's my fuckin' money!

01:56:07.985 --> 01:56:09.018
What are you doing?

01:56:09.052 --> 01:56:10.085
Look, I was gonna
leave tomorrow,

01:56:10.118 --> 01:56:11.718
give me that shit back.
Come on, June. Be cool.

01:56:11.751 --> 01:56:12.886
- I want you out tonight.
- Oh, fuck you, Lil!

01:56:12.919 --> 01:56:14.152
I don't give
a fuck about you!

01:56:14.185 --> 01:56:15.118
- Yeah fuck you!
- I don't give a fuck

01:56:15.152 --> 01:56:17.384
about nothin' that
they got goin' on over here.

01:56:17.418 --> 01:56:18.651
I'm here
for a motherfuckin' job.

01:56:18.685 --> 01:56:20.152
- Give me that shit back!
- Get your ass back!

01:56:20.185 --> 01:56:22.085
- What are you doing?
- Thank you so much.

01:56:22.118 --> 01:56:23.152
Get dressed, man!

01:56:23.185 --> 01:56:24.785
I see, you bitches played me.

01:56:24.818 --> 01:56:25.751
Look at all this money...

01:56:25.785 --> 01:56:28.451
Oh, this is fuckin' great!
This is just great!

01:56:28.484 --> 01:56:30.018
- Fuck you!
- So much fuckin' money!

01:56:30.052 --> 01:56:32.018
I can't believe she called me
over here for this shit, man!

01:56:32.052 --> 01:56:33.418
Fuck you,
I paid for August rent!

01:56:33.451 --> 01:56:34.484
Give me some of that back!

01:56:34.518 --> 01:56:35.685
Now give me my mom weed,
homeboy!

01:56:35.718 --> 01:56:37.152
I'm not telling you
where the weed's at!

01:56:37.185 --> 01:56:38.219
I'mma fuck you up!

01:56:38.252 --> 01:56:39.651
You got my money,
you're not getting my weed!

01:56:39.685 --> 01:56:40.818
It's right over there
actually.

01:56:40.853 --> 01:56:41.685
You fuckin' bitch!

01:56:41.718 --> 01:56:43.551
Ernesto, you get...

01:56:43.585 --> 01:56:45.052
- God...
- Oh, it's so hot

01:56:45.085 --> 01:56:47.618
in here. Ma, are you hot?
Oh, Ma, it's so hot.

01:56:47.651 --> 01:56:48.585
I'll fucking lunge kick
you and your mom!

01:56:48.618 --> 01:56:50.751
Oh, will you?
You got a green belt?

01:56:50.785 --> 01:56:51.818
You gonna do
some of those moves?

01:56:51.853 --> 01:56:53.551
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:56:53.585 --> 01:56:55.918
- Relax, Ernesto!
- Get him out, guys.

01:56:55.952 --> 01:56:56.785
Now get your shit
and get out.

01:56:56.818 --> 01:56:57.751
That's right.
It's time to go.

01:56:57.785 --> 01:56:59.484
And don't even
think about stepping foot

01:56:59.518 --> 01:57:01.518
in Texas City again.
You got me?

01:57:01.551 --> 01:57:03.952
Ain't no lie, baby,
bye, bye, bye.

01:57:05.152 --> 01:57:06.384
Can I put my clothes on,
please,

01:57:06.418 --> 01:57:07.451
can you just
give me some privacy

01:57:07.484 --> 01:57:08.618
so I can put
my clothes on, please?

01:57:08.651 --> 01:57:11.052
You got 30 motherfuckin'
seconds, homeboy.

01:57:11.085 --> 01:57:12.918
Thirty seconds
'cause you wasting my time.

01:57:12.952 --> 01:57:13.853
Okay.

01:57:13.885 --> 01:57:14.853
That's less
than a minute, Mikey.

01:57:14.885 --> 01:57:16.685
Yeah,
I'll give you less than a minute.

01:57:16.718 --> 01:57:17.685
Less than
a motherfuckin' minute.

01:57:17.718 --> 01:57:19.551
I'll give you
less than a fuckin' minute.

01:57:19.585 --> 01:57:21.618
Thirty seconds
starts now.

01:57:21.651 --> 01:57:23.451
- You hear me? 30 seconds.
- Yup.

01:57:23.484 --> 01:57:25.518
Thank you. All right,
let me get changed. Jesus.

01:57:25.551 --> 01:57:26.585
Motherfucker.

01:57:26.618 --> 01:57:28.451
Look at
all this money.

01:57:28.484 --> 01:57:29.985
Hurry the the fuck up,
you nasty bitch.

01:57:31.085 --> 01:57:33.152
One, two...

01:57:33.185 --> 01:57:37.918
...three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

01:57:37.952 --> 01:57:39.451
nine... Thirty!

01:57:43.853 --> 01:57:45.052
Oh, man.

01:57:45.085 --> 01:57:46.685
Mama's gonna kill me.

01:58:22.118 --> 01:58:23.918
Leondria!

01:58:23.952 --> 01:58:25.885
Shit. Open up!

01:58:26.551 --> 01:58:27.685
- Whoa!
- Shit.

01:58:27.718 --> 01:58:28.752
- Oh!
- Okay, sorry.

01:58:28.786 --> 01:58:30.786
Oh, fuck this!
What are you doing?

01:58:30.818 --> 01:58:31.852
- We gotta talk.
- Where's June?

01:58:31.885 --> 01:58:33.786
- What do you mean? You sent...
- Wait! I don't...

01:58:33.818 --> 01:58:34.852
Listen. Go in the back.

01:58:34.885 --> 01:58:36.685
Okay. Can...
Can I have a towel?

01:58:36.718 --> 01:58:37.918
Hell no!
Go that way.

01:58:38.952 --> 01:58:39.952
Fuck this.

01:58:41.985 --> 01:58:43.418
Cover that shit up, boy.

01:58:47.152 --> 01:58:48.451
Okay, look, yeah,
you want me to admit it,

01:58:48.484 --> 01:58:49.618
I was selling
to the hardhats.

01:58:49.651 --> 01:58:51.651
I know you told me not to,
but they're good customers.

01:58:51.685 --> 01:58:53.551
They're good guys.

01:58:53.585 --> 01:58:55.484
I... I...
You got their money.

01:59:01.018 --> 01:59:02.152
Yes?

01:59:02.185 --> 01:59:03.685
Yeah. Out back.

01:59:09.451 --> 01:59:12.118
You're <i>persona non grata.</i>

01:59:12.152 --> 01:59:14.384
You know what that means,
Mr. Hollywood?

01:59:14.418 --> 01:59:16.551
Yes. Yes, I know what that means.
But why?

01:59:16.585 --> 01:59:18.451
I'm looking out for Lil.

01:59:18.484 --> 01:59:20.484
And that's all
you need to know.

01:59:21.518 --> 01:59:22.852
Goddamn sabotage.

01:59:23.551 --> 01:59:24.818
- Okay.
- Whatever.

01:59:26.152 --> 01:59:28.118
Oh, great,
the goonette squad.

01:59:28.152 --> 01:59:29.319
Look at them go.

01:59:29.351 --> 01:59:31.785
All right, Ma, man,
this nigga jumped out the window.

01:59:31.818 --> 01:59:33.451
Is Lil and Lexi okay?

01:59:33.484 --> 01:59:34.518
They're fine.

01:59:34.551 --> 01:59:35.918
Hey, man,
shut the fuck up.

01:59:36.985 --> 01:59:39.018
Look, that house is crazy.

01:59:39.052 --> 01:59:41.118
Everybody over there
screamin' and cryin',

01:59:41.152 --> 01:59:43.818
this motherfucker with
his junk swingin' everywhere.

01:59:43.852 --> 01:59:45.719
This lazy bastard
not doin' shit.

01:59:45.751 --> 01:59:47.018
- Besides sittin' on your ass.
- Shit, I do a lot.

01:59:47.052 --> 01:59:48.618
I showed up, man,
I'm the fuckin' muscle.

01:59:48.651 --> 01:59:50.451
And your lazy ass,

01:59:50.484 --> 01:59:51.719
all you did
was get the money.

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:53.152
And then
you were just watchin'.

01:59:53.185 --> 01:59:54.686
Nobody told me
I was going to be draggin'

01:59:54.719 --> 01:59:56.018
a freakin' butt-naked dude
out the bed.

01:59:56.052 --> 01:59:57.651
Man, you ain't
even do shit, anyways.

01:59:57.686 --> 01:59:59.085
I don't need you coming
on no runs with me.

01:59:59.118 --> 02:00:01.085
You ain't nothin' but
deadweight, motherfucker.

02:00:01.118 --> 02:00:03.118
Okay. That's cool.
It's all good.

02:00:03.152 --> 02:00:04.686
Mom, you gonna
let her talk to me like that?

02:00:04.718 --> 02:00:05.852
Hell yeah,
I'mma talk to you like that.

02:00:05.885 --> 02:00:07.551
- Listen...
- She can't save you.

02:00:07.585 --> 02:00:08.652
- Time-out.
- Okay.

02:00:08.686 --> 02:00:11.351
- Lazy motherfucker.
- Time the fuck out.

02:00:12.686 --> 02:00:14.451
Yeah, you guys
are on time-out.

02:00:14.484 --> 02:00:16.785
- Shut up.
- Shut up, bro. Zip it.

02:00:18.085 --> 02:00:19.085
Mom...

02:00:20.118 --> 02:00:21.885
This incident
ruined my night.

02:00:21.918 --> 02:00:23.852
One of my buddies
had a party at Oceans,

02:00:23.885 --> 02:00:24.785
I could have been there.

02:00:24.818 --> 02:00:26.885
But I gotta come
and deal with this bullshit!

02:00:26.918 --> 02:00:27.785
You see?
Constant complaining.

02:00:27.818 --> 02:00:29.484
You were there
to protect your sister.

02:00:29.518 --> 02:00:30.952
He not coming
with me no more.

02:00:30.985 --> 02:00:31.952
A'ight, well,
I'm done with this shit.

02:00:31.985 --> 02:00:33.085
You should've
stayed your ass at home.

02:00:33.118 --> 02:00:34.484
You know what?

02:00:34.518 --> 02:00:36.118
We havin' a family meeting
after this.

02:00:36.152 --> 02:00:37.952
- Family meeting?
- Point-blank.

02:00:37.985 --> 02:00:39.152
- You serious?
- We need a meeting.

02:00:39.185 --> 02:00:40.285
You can take that information

02:00:40.319 --> 02:00:42.751
and do what you want with it.

02:00:42.785 --> 02:00:44.685
You ain't going
to that fucked-up club.

02:00:44.718 --> 02:00:45.751
You ain't goin' nowhere.

02:00:45.785 --> 02:00:47.885
Homeboy, you gon' sit right
here and roll with us.

02:00:47.918 --> 02:00:49.484
We need a meeting.

02:00:49.518 --> 02:00:50.619
Now back to you.

02:00:50.652 --> 02:00:52.384
Yeah, yeah,
back to the sabotage.

02:00:52.418 --> 02:00:54.885
Whatever you wanna call it.
It's over with.

02:00:54.918 --> 02:00:57.551
That was between me and Lexi.
Seriously, what the fuck.

02:00:57.585 --> 02:00:58.418
At the end of the day,

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:00.585
it's about you getting up
out of Texas.

02:01:00.619 --> 02:01:02.551
It's time for you
to bounce.

02:01:02.585 --> 02:01:03.852
Yeah, I'm fixin' to,

02:01:03.885 --> 02:01:05.718
but I was gonna leave
in the morning,

02:01:05.751 --> 02:01:07.685
I need money
to do that.

02:01:07.718 --> 02:01:09.785
Well, maybe you could go sell
one of your fuck trophies.

02:01:09.818 --> 02:01:11.484
Hey,
watch your mouth in front of Mom.

02:01:11.518 --> 02:01:12.852
What's wrong with you?

02:01:12.885 --> 02:01:14.018
Did you give him his 200?

02:01:14.052 --> 02:01:16.118
I was, but then his punk-ass
jumped out the window.

02:01:16.152 --> 02:01:17.418
Two hundred, that's it?

02:01:17.451 --> 02:01:18.751
That's enough
to get you a bus ticket

02:01:18.785 --> 02:01:19.785
far beyond the state line.

02:01:22.651 --> 02:01:24.619
After everything
I did for you.

02:01:24.651 --> 02:01:26.052
Two hundred. Wow.

02:01:27.484 --> 02:01:28.785
Be gone by midday.

02:01:31.852 --> 02:01:34.418
- Thank your mom for me.
- I sure will.

02:01:34.451 --> 02:01:36.718
Maybe you oughta come
by our house sometime.

02:01:36.751 --> 02:01:37.885
Yeah, that would be nice.

02:01:37.918 --> 02:01:39.552
Yeah, you and Lex,
y'all come on over,

02:01:39.586 --> 02:01:40.885
we can, you know, barbeque,

02:01:40.918 --> 02:01:42.085
- drink some beer.
- Oh, that would be great.

02:01:43.586 --> 02:01:45.052
You know,
I should be taking

02:01:45.085 --> 02:01:46.552
the backpack
that you gave me,

02:01:46.586 --> 02:01:47.952
but, no, I'll take...
I'll use this.

02:01:47.985 --> 02:01:49.085
You want me
to walk down the street

02:01:49.118 --> 02:01:50.418
with a garbage bag? Fine.

02:01:50.451 --> 02:01:51.651
Yeah, you should.

02:01:51.685 --> 02:01:53.152
- Fuckin' bullshit.
- Like a hobo.

02:01:53.185 --> 02:01:54.885
Threw my clothes in there
all fucked up,

02:01:54.918 --> 02:01:55.785
I'm gonna fold my clothes

02:01:55.818 --> 02:01:56.818
so when I leave,
they're not wrinkled.

02:01:56.852 --> 02:01:58.985
Me and him got in a fight
about 25 years ago.

02:01:59.018 --> 02:02:00.052
Really?

02:02:00.085 --> 02:02:00.918
I whupped his ass
in high school.

02:02:00.952 --> 02:02:03.052
- I'm sure he deserved it.
- Yeah.

02:02:03.085 --> 02:02:04.018
I'm gonna take my time.

02:02:04.052 --> 02:02:05.552
- Let's see how you fold.
- Yeah, watch.

02:02:05.586 --> 02:02:06.952
- Oh, look at that fold...
- Oh, my God.

02:02:06.985 --> 02:02:08.552
Oh, you should work
at the Gap.

02:02:08.586 --> 02:02:10.085
Man, y'all get tired
of this shit, man?

02:02:10.118 --> 02:02:12.052
- No, I love it.
- Y'all get tired of this shit?

02:02:12.085 --> 02:02:13.651
Lil, you're
a good woman, Lil.

02:02:13.685 --> 02:02:15.118
- Thank you.
- You really are.

02:02:15.152 --> 02:02:16.519
Good seeing you again.

02:02:16.552 --> 02:02:18.052
Fuckin' dumb bitch.
All this...

02:02:18.085 --> 02:02:20.552
- Man, hurry the fuck up!
- June, relax! What the fuck!

02:02:20.585 --> 02:02:21.519
That's right, hurry up.
Thank you, June!

02:02:21.552 --> 02:02:23.052
- All right! Jesus.
- Get your shit, come on.

02:02:25.519 --> 02:02:26.751
June!

02:02:26.785 --> 02:02:28.852
There's been
a lot of drama here.

02:02:28.885 --> 02:02:30.852
Oh, no, no, no,
you're not taking big stripes!

02:02:30.885 --> 02:02:32.152
- Your big stripes...
- No, no!

02:02:32.185 --> 02:02:33.918
I have the 64-ounce one!

02:02:33.952 --> 02:02:35.618
And I took favorite shirt,
fuck you.

02:02:35.651 --> 02:02:38.785
...for you, in here,
Mikey, get the fuck...

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:40.451
- Come on!
- Go sit down!

02:02:40.484 --> 02:02:41.952
I'm taking my toothbrush!

02:02:41.985 --> 02:02:43.451
Don't pretend
you brush your teeth.

02:02:43.484 --> 02:02:45.552
- Shut up! Relax, June, damn.
- Oh, my God.

02:02:45.585 --> 02:02:46.751
All right, I'm going.

02:02:46.785 --> 02:02:49.618
Uh, Lil, seriously,
thank you so much for letting me stay,

02:02:49.651 --> 02:02:50.618
I had an amazing time,

02:02:50.651 --> 02:02:52.418
and you and your daughter
are dumb bitches.

02:02:52.451 --> 02:02:53.785
- Don't say that.
- Piece of shit.

02:02:53.818 --> 02:02:54.718
That is not right.

02:02:54.751 --> 02:02:55.618
- Get the fuck out!
- I gotta get water

02:02:55.651 --> 02:02:57.519
before I leave
'cause I'm gonna be thirsty!

02:02:57.551 --> 02:02:58.384
You gotta go, man.

02:02:58.418 --> 02:03:00.485
I bought this.
I bought this ashtray!

02:03:00.519 --> 02:03:02.685
No, I said when I
got, I can take it back.

02:03:02.718 --> 02:03:03.818
- Hey, let's go.
- You did not!

02:03:03.852 --> 02:03:05.384
- There's no take-backs!
- Fine. Fine.

02:03:05.418 --> 02:03:06.319
Get outta here, man.

02:03:06.351 --> 02:03:08.384
I should have beat your ass
in high school.

02:03:08.418 --> 02:03:09.852
Too bad it was the
other way around, huh?

02:03:09.885 --> 02:03:11.418
- Yeah.
- You want to go another round?

02:03:11.451 --> 02:03:13.485
Nah. You know what?

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:15.519
I got one last thing
to say to all you guys.

02:03:15.551 --> 02:03:17.018
- Man, shut your bitch-ass up.
- Shut up!

02:03:17.052 --> 02:03:18.585
- Shut the fuck up.
- Leave.

02:03:18.618 --> 02:03:20.518
Not another word out
of your mouth!

02:03:22.118 --> 02:03:24.852
Now get the fuck out,
you suitcase pimp.

02:03:25.818 --> 02:03:26.818
What'd you say?

02:03:28.018 --> 02:03:31.485
You heard me.
Suitcase pimp.

02:03:32.152 --> 02:03:33.685
Say that shit again.

02:03:33.718 --> 02:03:37.518
Homeless suitcase pimp.

02:03:40.551 --> 02:03:41.551
Hmm.

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:47.018
Just go ahead
and leave, dude.

02:03:52.518 --> 02:03:53.518
What the...

02:03:55.185 --> 02:03:57.118
- He's outta here, babe.
- He's outta here.

02:03:57.152 --> 02:03:58.852
No more.

02:03:58.885 --> 02:04:01.152
Ah, that was
nothin' but trouble.
