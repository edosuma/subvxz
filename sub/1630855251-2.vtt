Trent!

00:09.420 --> 00:11.480
- Vanessa! No! No!
- Trent!

00:12.880 --> 00:15.660
We've recruited an interstate detective
to lead the case.

00:15.860 --> 00:18.860
Detective Eddie Redcliffe is my name.
I am from Darwin.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.220
Who is the psycho
with the 25-page rap sheet?

00:22.420 --> 00:23.780
That is Gavin Latham,

00:23.980 --> 00:26.100
Trent Latham's brother
and business partner.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.740
What happened to
your windscreen, Gavin?

00:27.940 --> 00:29.540
- [Eddie] Who's that?
- [Dulcie] That's Trent.

00:29.740 --> 00:32.340
Looks like our brothers
took a little trip together.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.660
Time of death was between 3 and 4am.

00:34.860 --> 00:35.860
No foreign DNA on the body.

00:36.060 --> 00:38.260
What's the deal with
that forensic pathologist?

00:38.460 --> 00:40.000
"Lingua amputo."

[Dulcie] Five years ago,
Deadloch's mayor, Rod Dixon,

washed up dead on the same beach
as Trent Latham.

00:47.860 --> 00:48.940
Comin' through!

00:49.140 --> 00:50.100
Who was that woman with Dulcie?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.100
- The detective?
- He's a woman?

00:52.300 --> 00:54.260
Vanessa! Stop right there!

for work-life balance?

Well, I just don't think that the...

Oh, I have to go.

I think I'm still upset you lied to me
about Detective Redcliffe, you know?

02:33.140 --> 02:35.420
Yeah, and as I said,
I omitted some information

02:35.620 --> 02:38.060

So let's just reset.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.340
This whole investigation

02:54.540 --> 02:56.260

Alright. OK.

He kicked you off the footy team

Yeah, 'cause this town is cooked, brah.

She said that Detective Redcliffe

Very similar to the brother.

He's been completely cleaned.

- Wow!
- Ah, excuse me, babe.

04:19.980 --> 04:22.140
- The hyoid was broken.
- Mm-hm?

04:22.340 --> 04:23.700
Same sort of ligature
was used to strangle him.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.620
- You see these bruises here?
- Mm-hm.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.140
- [Dulcie] Detective!
- They're full of blood.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.900
You said the autopsy started at nine.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.820
Oh, well, the early bird
catches the crim.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.540
OK, let's get back to it, can we?

04:33.740 --> 04:35.620
James, how long was Gavin's body
on the beach?

04:35.820 --> 04:37.900
Nup. What about the Latham brothers'
tox report?

04:38.100 --> 04:39.660
What are we talking?
Fuck-ton of drugs?

04:39.860 --> 04:41.460
You reckon some fucking local dealer
bumped 'em off?

04:41.660 --> 04:43.980
Well, we won't found out who killed him
until we found out how it happened.

04:44.180 --> 04:45.660
Now, the bodies
were transported by boat.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.220
Oh, you and your fucking boats!

04:47.420 --> 04:49.580
[James] OK, Collins,
in answer to your question...

04:49.780 --> 04:51.220
the minimal amount of pooled blood

04:51.420 --> 04:53.020
suggests the body
hadn't been lying on the beach long,

04:53.220 --> 04:54.820
- which actually suggests the killer...

04:55.020 --> 04:55.980

05:07.260 --> 05:08.980
What about his fucking
toxicology report?

05:09.180 --> 05:11.460
Yeah, it's still pending, Detective.
The liver's damaged, though.

05:11.660 --> 05:14.140
But from what? Drugs?
Hey? Which ones?

05:14.340 --> 05:15.700
Ah, T-B-C.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.700
Well, T-B-have a fucking guess.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.540
OK, what type of knife was used
to cut out his tongue, James?

05:20.740 --> 05:21.980
How was his tongue removed?

05:22.180 --> 05:24.120
With difficulty, I'd say. [chuckles]

05:25.640 --> 05:29.380
See these ragged marks on the throat?
They're from a serrated blade.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.620
But these ones on the cheek,
they're more dagger-like.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.700
- So the killer...
- [phone buzzes and dings]
- Ugh.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.620
Can we just have a modicum of
decorum in here, please...

05:35.820 --> 05:37.660
Can you just keep going, James?
Thank you. Just keep going.

05:37.860 --> 05:41.140
I surmise the killer used two knives
to cut out the tongue.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.700
Which tracks: the tongue is actually
the strongest muscle in the human body.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.340
- [Dulcie] It's not, James.
- Yeah, yeah, just wind it up, mate.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.340

right n...

at the old sawmill.

source of employment in the town.

husband, Rod Dixon,

food products, Margaret's Table...

that knob-jockey boyfriend.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.260

06:22.460 --> 06:24.220
Because I'm on this case,
and I can drive us,

06:24.420 --> 06:26.020
so here we find ourselves.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.920
And I think it's relevant
because Rod Dixon was the mayor.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.940
On the beach.
With the missing tongue.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.220
Oh, you're not still going on
about that, are ya?

06:36.420 --> 06:39.780
Yes, I am, because fur seals
don't eat human flesh.

06:39.980 --> 06:42.220
I think it's worth reinterrogating
how the tongue was removed.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.500
No, no, no. OK?

06:43.700 --> 06:47.500
Enough of your fucking Miss Marble's
Midwinter Murder Theories, mate.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.460
The Latham brothers were
up their scrotes in drugs.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.780
Someone's making an example of them.
Who's... Who's the local drug dealer?

06:53.980 --> 06:54.780
Joan.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.540
OK, so this Joan, what is she?

06:56.740 --> 06:59.740
Is she like a Judy Moran
crime matriarch?

06:59.940 --> 07:01.780
She sells under-the-counter hash gummies

07:01.980 --> 07:05.220
at the local farmers' market
every second Sunday of the month.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.220
- OK, well, it's bigger than Joan.
- Mm-hm.

07:07.420 --> 07:11.220
Town like this, probably some kingpin
running drugs with boats

07:11.420 --> 07:15.340
and he's gone under your radar
because he is a man and you are a...

- Mm-mm.

07:55.820 --> 07:57.300

Yeah, please. Yeah, you do that.

08:18.140 --> 08:21.100
So Gavin and Trent used to work
out here at the sawmill, didn't they?

work at the sawmill

08:22.900 --> 08:24.340
before your lot took root, hmm?

08:24.540 --> 08:27.020
[Dulcie] Any idea what Gavin
was doing out here the night he died?

08:27.220 --> 08:28.620
[McGangus] Absolutely no idea.

08:28.820 --> 08:30.140

08:30.340 --> 08:31.780
Can I help you there, sweetheart?

08:31.980 --> 08:34.100
Yeah, what's all that shit? In there?

08:34.300 --> 08:35.620
Well, that's my personal property.

08:35.820 --> 08:37.420
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.780
And where were you two nights ago,
Mr... McGangus, was it?

08:40.980 --> 08:43.340
I was with Mike Nugent at
the footy club, planning Trent's wake.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.540
Now I've got to plan another one
because two of me mates are dead.

08:45.740 --> 08:46.780
It's no good, is it, Phil?

08:46.980 --> 08:49.960
And can this, ah, Mark, corrobor...

08:50.960 --> 08:52.540
...corrlob... corroba...

08:52.740 --> 08:54.540
Can<i> Mike</i> corroborate that, Phil?

08:54.740 --> 08:56.020
Well, I wouldn't have said it
if he couldn't.

08:56.220 --> 08:57.860
What about you, Jimmy?
Where were you two nights ago?

08:58.060 --> 08:59.780
I was at the Doorbell till closing.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.260
- She was there too.
- That's irrelevant.

09:02.460 --> 09:03.980
Were the Lathams involved in drugs?

09:04.180 --> 09:05.140
Not that I'm aware.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.980
- Are you involved in drugs?
- Not that I'm aware.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.940
I'd like to take a look
in that sawmill, Phil.

09:09.140 --> 09:11.020
Would you?
You know what you need for that.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.660
- A warrant.
- Eyes.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.660
Mm, yeah, is that alright with you,
Inspectress?

09:14.860 --> 09:17.420
Yeah, 'course. Is it OK with you,
Phil, if you eat my dick?

09:17.620 --> 09:19.880
[McGangus chuckles]
Shane's gonna love this.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.640
[scoffs]

09:29.640 --> 09:31.980
Good. That was good.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.220
So, up in Darwin, do you lot threaten
all interviewees with fellatio,

09:36.420 --> 09:37.980
or just the ones that are grieving?

09:38.180 --> 09:39.340
Let's go.

09:39.540 --> 09:40.540
You want to tell me where?

09:40.740 --> 09:42.660
Fuck! Trent's wife!

09:42.860 --> 09:44.140
Vajazzle.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.360
- [squelch]
- Agh!

09:50.720 --> 09:52.140
It's Margaret's Feastival, Gez,

09:52.340 --> 09:53.900
and her name looks like "Maggot".

09:54.100 --> 09:55.140
Maggot Carruthers.

09:55.340 --> 09:58.020
Oh, gosh, I feel like such a dingo.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.260
It's OK, babe.
I know it's just a mistake.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.100
[Dulcie] Detective, what are you doing?

10:03.300 --> 10:05.540
But, obviously, fix it, or I'm revoking
your volunteer privileges.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.300
Dulcie!

10:07.500 --> 10:09.140
[Eddie] Is this
the drug-cunt brothers' gym, is it?

10:09.340 --> 10:11.600
[Dulcie] Well it's Gavin
and Trent Latham's gym, yes.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.380
Detective, in light of
the Phil McGangus debacle,

10:15.580 --> 10:18.860
I'd like to take the lead
on the interview with Vanessa myself.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.300
This is my town and Vanessa and I
have a relationship.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.300
Oh, yeah,
what's that relationship like?

10:23.500 --> 10:24.940
You and your inner-city lezzo mates

10:25.140 --> 10:27.260
narrowly avoiding getting
hate-crimed by Vanessa's lot?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.220
Ah, well, obviously Deadloch
isn't perfect...

10:29.420 --> 10:30.540
It's Satan's fucking snow globe!

10:30.740 --> 10:33.220
I think that right now, Vanessa
would appreciate a familiar face,

10:33.420 --> 10:34.660
in a pair of actual shoes.

10:34.860 --> 10:35.740
[Aleyna] Dulcie!

10:35.940 --> 10:37.260
Mate, I am the lead detective, OK?

10:37.460 --> 10:40.060
You are a day-rate cop who's used to
solving great mysteries like

10:40.260 --> 10:42.100
"My Hat Is Missing",
and "I Shot My Dog".

10:42.300 --> 10:44.540
So, hipso facto, I'll be doing
the interviewing, OK?

10:44.740 --> 10:45.660
- Dulcie?
- Yes?

10:45.860 --> 10:48.260
What you pulled at the parade
last night cannot happen again, OK?

10:48.460 --> 10:49.740
OK, well, I didn't kill him myself,
Aleyna.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.100
I mean it. No more of this
dead body nonsense.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.780
You know how hard Margaret and I
have worked at this Feastival?

10:54.980 --> 10:55.940
It's given me IBS.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.940
Detective! Aleyna,
I do want to, and I will...

10:58.140 --> 11:01.080
My colon is shredded, Dulcie.
Shredded!

11:03.560 --> 11:05.300
[Eddie] We found the Pro-Bro ute
this morning.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.100
Pretty... Pretty schmick rig.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.180
Yeah, must be worth a bit of coin.

11:09.380 --> 11:10.660
Got me thinking, you know?

11:10.860 --> 11:15.100
How could Trent and Gavin afford
a souped-up ute like that when...

11:15.300 --> 11:19.540
that gym downstairs is emptier than
an arsehole after breakfast?

11:19.740 --> 11:21.740
- Was it drugs, Vanessa?
- Detective.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.540
Was it drugs?

11:23.740 --> 11:28.660
You know, started with
'roids, peptides, Molly, then, bang!

11:28.860 --> 11:32.260
Half of Deadloch are just sticking
Special K right up the dick hole.

11:32.460 --> 11:33.660
- Is that it, Vanessa?
- I... I am...

11:33.860 --> 11:35.820
- Is that it, huh?
- I'm deeply sorry about this.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.900
- I don't like you.
- OK.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.020
We know you threw the plate
at his head, didn't you, Vanessa?

11:40.220 --> 11:42.020
No, Trent threw the plate at her!

11:42.220 --> 11:44.500
It ricocheted off the marble accent tray
and hit him in the head.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.460
And we know about the affair.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.540
- Mm, we've seen the dick pics.
- Detective.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.980
How long have you and Gav
been smashing meat?

11:51.180 --> 11:53.620
No, Mum kept telling Uncle Gavin
to stop sending her photos,

11:53.820 --> 11:55.500
but he just kept sending them.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.300
See? Look at her phone for yourself.

11:58.500 --> 12:02.060
- Oh, good one.
- I'm not even sure if they're his.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.220
They have watermarks.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.740
I never wanted his penises.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.500
Ah... Who are you?

12:08.700 --> 12:09.780
Are you her dad, are ya?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.800
No, I'm Greg, from Grey Lady Funerals.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.820
Ah, Vanessa, Rod Dixon was their boss
at the sawmill. Were they on good terms?

12:18.020 --> 12:19.140
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

12:19.340 --> 12:20.900
Just a second, Vanessa.
This question is relevant.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.420
- My fuzzy brown arse it is.
- It absolutely is.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.420
More relevant than anything
out of your mouth this morning.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.180
- I'll tell you what is a relevant...
- [Vanessa] Rod.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.020
Yeah. Yes, Vanessa.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.440
He was president of the mayor.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.780
He was...

12:32.980 --> 12:36.700
President of the football club,
and the mayor. Thank you, Vanessa.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.780
- Lesbian.
- OK.

12:38.980 --> 12:41.180
Everything was good until
Mr Dixon died,

12:41.380 --> 12:42.940
then his wife shut the sawmill down.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.380
I see.

12:44.580 --> 12:47.340
Mum said it was part of God's plan,
because if they hadn't lost their jobs,

12:47.540 --> 12:49.500
then the three of them would have
never opened the Beast Factory.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.940
Three?

12:51.140 --> 12:52.680
Yeah. Phil's a part-owner.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.020
Really? Well, isn't that fascinating.

12:57.220 --> 13:00.460
And what percentage of...
of that did he own?

13:00.660 --> 13:03.160
I don't know. I'm 17.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.020
[Abby] Phil's a majority owner
of the Beast Factory.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.420
He co-owns Pro-Bro protein powder.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.700
He owns Vanessa and Trent's place
upstairs.

13:10.900 --> 13:11.980
Well, that's fucking cosy, isn't it?

13:12.180 --> 13:13.820
And, of course, the old sawmill site.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.660
Oh, gee, Sarge,

13:15.860 --> 13:18.980
I wonder where he's getting
all the cash for all these purchases?

13:19.180 --> 13:22.180
If Phil was running drugs,
we would know about it.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.500
The money's probably from
his fishing business. He owns a trawler.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.500
Well, there's a fucking
mystery murder boat

13:26.700 --> 13:28.820
you've been banging on about,
it's Phil the drug king's boat!

13:29.020 --> 13:30.420
Phil's boat was not used in the murder.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.860
The harbour surveillance footage
from the night Trent died

13:33.060 --> 13:35.060
comes<i> from</i> Phil's boat, Detective.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.740
It was parked at the harbour all night.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.060
It's moored, ma'am. Sorry.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.980
OK, then he's got some associate,
you know?

13:42.180 --> 13:43.620
A dodgy fuck who's got a boat

13:43.820 --> 13:45.860
and he carts the bodies
and the drugs around.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.700
You are over-simplifying this.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.740
What the fuck is Father Time
doing up here?

13:49.940 --> 13:51.140
I told you that Rod Dixon's death

13:51.340 --> 13:53.420
might be connected to
Trent and Gavin's.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.900
There is no connection, OK?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.340
And if you mention
the seal tongue again,

13:56.540 --> 13:58.300
I swear to God I'm gonna
cunt-punch you so hard

13:58.500 --> 13:59.860
you're gonna double as a hand puppet.

14:00.060 --> 14:02.700
[Sven] Dulce, I've got Cath
on the phone. She says it's important.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.540
Well, did she try my mobile?

14:04.740 --> 14:06.460
Yes, but your coverage is terrible.

14:06.660 --> 14:07.560
Right.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.660
[murmurs] Bullshit.

14:12.860 --> 14:13.660
Hi, love.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.260
Sexy, you've got to get a new mobile
carrier. Your coverage is terrible.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.180
I'm picking up tickets
to Helena Papatonis...

14:18.380 --> 14:20.620
Oh, love, I really can't
see a show right now.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.500
<i>No, I know.</i>
<i>I gave your tickets to Nadiyah.</i>

14:22.700 --> 14:24.020
Textbook Skye,
making her new girlfriend

14:24.220 --> 14:26.420
move to a town
where the poor thing knows no-one.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.140
- So depressing.
- Right, yeah.

14:28.340 --> 14:29.540
[Eddie] Fucking knew it!

14:29.740 --> 14:33.380
Amphetamines, uppers, downers,
tranqs, steroids, peptides, shrooms.

14:33.580 --> 14:34.740
The Latham brother's tox report

14:34.940 --> 14:37.820
reads like a fucking
dark web shopping cart.

14:38.020 --> 14:40.500
And I bet my right tit
McGangus and those Latham boys

14:40.700 --> 14:42.620
are storing drugs
at that fucking sawmill

14:42.820 --> 14:45.140
in that banana-guava flavoured
Pro-Bro shit.

14:45.340 --> 14:47.340
Maybe that's why Gavin was out there
the night he died, ma'am?

14:47.540 --> 14:48.940
Yeah, he was moving the product.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.760
The Latham boys did the dirty on him
and that's why Phil killed them.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.420
I need to search that sawmill.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.340
You! How are you getting on with
that warrant?

14:56.540 --> 14:58.900
Warrant? I didn't know
that was in my column.

14:59.100 --> 15:02.480
Oh, fucking small town fucking...

15:03.480 --> 15:04.460
[Cath]<i> Nadiyah just told me</i>

15:04.660 --> 15:06.300
<i>the detective has to move out of</i>
<i>the Bush Wolf tomorrow.</i>

15:06.500 --> 15:08.260
<i>Her room's been put up</i>
<i>for the Feastival.</i>

15:08.460 --> 15:09.620
OK. Alright.

15:09.820 --> 15:11.140
The earlier she can check out,
the better,

15:11.340 --> 15:12.740
just so Nads has got time
to give it a clean.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.580
It looks like a Tracey Emin
installation, apparently.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.020
Big Eyes, grab your keys.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.540
Oh, um, I've actually got
my wedding make-up trial today.

15:18.740 --> 15:20.140
- Cancel it.
- OK.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.740
[Cath]<i> Don't stress about it,</i>
<i>I'll find the detective</i>
<i>somewhere to stay.</i>

15:22.940 --> 15:25.060
<i>I'll take it off your plate</i>
<i>and I'll put it on my plate.</i>

15:25.260 --> 15:27.020
Oh, thank you.
Thanks, love, that's great.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.020
Speaking of plates, I really want to
go down on you tonight.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.140
<i>Oh, OK.</i>

15:31.340 --> 15:33.780
'Cause, you know, when we
work through conflict, I get horny.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.940
Shouldn't we wait for
Senior Sergeant Collins, ma'am?

15:36.140 --> 15:37.140
Nup.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.340
You, get her onto Phil McNugget's alibi.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.340
- Yep.
- We're going bush.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.580
- Oh, actually that's Dulcie's jacket.
- Who?

15:43.780 --> 15:45.820
- I do have to go right now, love.
- <i> OK.</i>

15:46.020 --> 15:48.460
OK, sexy, I love you. Bye!

15:48.660 --> 15:52.140
[Sven] Hi, Virginia.
Now, I need to organise a warrant.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.580
So, what's the go there?

15:54.780 --> 15:56.340
Is there a county sheriff that I call,
or is it a PDF...

15:56.540 --> 15:57.900
Where'd she go?

15:58.100 --> 16:01.660
Ah, she didn't say, but she wants you
to verify Phil's alibi, please.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.280
- Oh, she does, does she?
- Mm-hm.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.320
Where's my jacket?

16:08.880 --> 16:13.140
[Eddie] Come on Phil, you puffed-up
fuck-hole. Show yourself.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.260
I can't believe I'm on a stakeout!

16:15.460 --> 16:17.560
It's so aggressively policey.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.580
So did you always want to be
a female detective?

16:23.780 --> 16:26.300
It's pretty cool. There aren't many
women in forensic science, either.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.780
That's what I originally studied.
James was my lecturer, actually...

16:28.980 --> 16:30.400
- Too much talking.
- Yep!

16:33.560 --> 16:35.440
[phone rings and buzzes]

16:36.960 --> 16:38.380
That might be Senior Sergeant Collins.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.820
Should we tell her what we're doing?

16:40.020 --> 16:41.420
Nah, I'll text her.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.040
[phone continues ringing]

16:46.200 --> 16:48.000
[phone rings]

16:51.600 --> 16:55.140
<i>Yeah, nah, it's Eddie. Ah, yeah, nah,</i>
<i>leave us a message.</i>

16:55.340 --> 16:56.300
[beep]

16:56.500 --> 16:57.400
[hangs up]

17:13.760 --> 17:15.220
Phil McGangus said that

17:15.420 --> 17:17.300
you were with him the night that
Gavin died.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.580
Is that correct, Mike?

17:18.780 --> 17:20.820
Yeah. We were organising
the music for Trent's wake.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.700
- Mm-hm.
- A lot of Tool.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.400
It's what he would have wanted.

17:25.560 --> 17:30.700
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Helena Papatonis. Is that you?

17:30.900 --> 17:32.860
Ah, no, I'm a cop.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.980
Yeah, the performance
is over the road.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.080
Oh.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.160
Can't believe the Latham boys
are both dead.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.700
25 blokes graduated my year
at Deadloch High.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.340
Now there's only a few left.

17:47.540 --> 17:48.460
Really? Why?

17:48.660 --> 17:51.220
Suicide. Drugs.

17:51.420 --> 17:54.660
Oh, there was one drink-driving accident
wiped about seven of them.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.380
They were in a boat.

17:56.580 --> 17:57.800
On the roof.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.940
Was that all you wanted to ask me?

18:03.140 --> 18:06.560
Yeah. that was my only job
for the whole day. Thank you, Mike.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.540
Actually, no, Mike,
there is something else.

18:12.740 --> 18:13.940
You were still on the force

18:14.140 --> 18:15.900
when Rod Dixon's body
was found, weren't you?

18:16.100 --> 18:18.060
Yeah, that was my last day.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.060
Put a bit of a dampener
on my farewell drinks.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.160
Why aren't there any photos
in the case file?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.420
- Sven, it's me.
- [Sven]<i> Hey.</i>

18:25.620 --> 18:29.460
I need you to have a hunt around
for any old station cameras lying about.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.300
I'm looking for some photos of
Rod Dixon's body.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.100
Apparently the old station sergeant

18:34.300 --> 18:36.460
used to let them take the camera home
on the weekends.

18:36.660 --> 18:37.460
<i>OK.</i>

18:37.660 --> 18:39.940
And any instructions from the detective
as to my next steps?

18:40.140 --> 18:41.820
- <i> Ah, nope. Nothing yet.</i>
- Nothing!

18:42.020 --> 18:45.660
- OK, perfect.
- <i> OK. Cheers, Dulce. Bye.</i>

18:45.860 --> 18:46.760
[hangs up]

19:28.680 --> 19:31.340
Cath. Cath, when does this finish?

19:31.540 --> 19:33.420
It's Endurance Art, Nadiyah.
No-one knows.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.220
Ugh, wow.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.180
OK. [chuckles]

19:37.380 --> 19:40.420
Um, I have a lot of people checking
into the Bush Wolf today, though.

19:40.620 --> 19:41.700
[crowd] Shhh!

19:41.900 --> 19:43.040
[whispers] Sorry.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
[exhales]

19:50.560 --> 19:51.800
[Cath whispers] Dulcie!

20:03.520 --> 20:06.420
[Dulcie] Sorry Margaret, I didn't mean
to interrupt your Feastival meeting.

20:06.620 --> 20:09.700
It's fine, it's fine. Here we are.

20:09.900 --> 20:10.900
Thank you, darling.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.220
- Thank you.
- Vanilla dust?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.900
Ah, no, thanks, darling, Margaret,
I'm working.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.380
It's sugar, darling.
It's not methamphetamines. Mm-hm.

20:17.580 --> 20:18.580
[chuckles]

20:18.780 --> 20:21.180
So, here is the artwork
for your book launch.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.460
[gasps]
God, I look like a psychopath!

20:24.660 --> 20:26.300
Well, we can change it.
We'll change it.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.940
No, no, it's fine, darling.
It's fine, it's fine.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.460
Your semi-freddo is melting, hmm?

20:29.660 --> 20:31.180
I actually do have a few questions
for Margaret...

20:31.380 --> 20:32.900
No, Dulcie, I was here first.
This is my turn.

20:33.100 --> 20:36.300
Aleyna, I want you to go outside
and start walking.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.820
And then I want you to keep walking

20:38.020 --> 20:39.820
until your shoulders
stop grazing your ears.

20:40.020 --> 20:41.060
You're very stressed.

20:41.260 --> 20:43.620
I am stressed, Margaret.
My colon is red-raw.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.420
I'm sorry if that's
too much information,

20:45.620 --> 20:47.660
but you just remind me
a lot of my mother.

20:47.860 --> 20:49.100
- Except more motherly.
- Yeah.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.200
- And white.
- Good. Off you pop.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.980
Aleyna!

20:54.180 --> 20:55.080
Slower.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.420
Now, Dulce, how can I help?

21:03.620 --> 21:04.880
It's about Rod.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.220
If you've come to tell me he's dead,
you're a bit late.

21:08.420 --> 21:11.900
It's just a formality with...

21:12.100 --> 21:14.380
beach-based... deaths.

21:14.580 --> 21:17.580
Was Rod alone on the boat
the night he drowned?

21:17.780 --> 21:20.820
Yes. I mean, normally he went fishing
with his friend Sam...

21:21.020 --> 21:22.340
Sam O'Dwyer?

21:22.540 --> 21:25.380
Yes, but that night he was alone,
and, um...

21:25.580 --> 21:28.820
weather was terrible,
and he just... he just...

21:29.020 --> 21:30.980
fell in.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.340
- No life-jacket, of course.
- Mmm.

21:33.540 --> 21:34.900
- Men!
- Yeah.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.300
So, what are your thoughts?

21:36.500 --> 21:41.220
I'm just... I'm not at liberty to
discuss the case, Margaret, sorry.

21:41.420 --> 21:42.820
I meant the semi-freddo.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.180
- Oh!
- It's for the dessert line.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.180
Right. Mmm. Sorry. It's good.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.780
It is just awful though, isn't it?

21:47.980 --> 21:50.460
- It's maybe a little gritty.
- I meant the murders.

21:50.660 --> 21:52.860
Right. No, the murders.
They are very bad.

21:53.060 --> 21:56.300
So, did you see Rod's body?

21:56.500 --> 21:57.740
Ah, no, no.

21:57.940 --> 21:59.500
- The police recommended against it.
- Mm-hm.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.700
You know, because of what
Kevin the Seal did to him.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.460
- But Claire saw him.
- Claire?

22:05.660 --> 22:07.900
Yeah, Claire found Rod
when she was walking her groodle.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.400
She did a painting of him.
Tried to give it to me.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.720
Hmm.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.940
I tried to give it to Margaret,
but she didn't want it.

22:20.140 --> 22:21.620
Really? I can't...

22:21.820 --> 22:23.500
Yeah, but I mean,
you've seen the Carruthers Estate.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.620
I don't think Margaret's
much into modern art.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.060
Yeah, yeah, that... that's the reason.

22:28.260 --> 22:32.660
My therapist thought that painting Rod
might help me process the experience.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.340
It didn't.
I mean, I ended up taking Valium.

22:35.540 --> 22:36.500
[vaper bubbles]

22:36.700 --> 22:38.940
I left my therapist.
I mean, she was terrible.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.700
Also, we kept sleeping together.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.000
[bubbling]

22:43.280 --> 22:44.780
Oh, what? It's medicinal, Dulce.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.720
Mm-hm. Do you have a prescription?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.200
[bubbling]

22:53.320 --> 22:55.040
Claire, what's that mark?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.320
Oh, that's red wine.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.820
Oh, bum.
I thought it was something else.

23:02.020 --> 23:05.260
Hey, how is Cath going
at Helena Papatonis?

23:05.460 --> 23:07.360
It was so boring I had to leave.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.080
[exhales shakily]

23:32.440 --> 23:33.760
[snores softly]

23:39.240 --> 23:40.940
Ma'am!

23:41.140 --> 23:42.140
- Ugh.
- Ma'am!

23:42.340 --> 23:43.460
- Oh!
- Sorry!

23:43.660 --> 23:45.940
- Fuck!
- Phil's loading Pro-Bro boxes!

23:46.140 --> 23:48.780
Oh, fuck. [wearily] We're on, we're on.
Follow them.

23:48.980 --> 23:50.080
- [starts engine]
- [groans]

23:51.120 --> 23:52.880
- No lights!
- Sorry, ma'am!

24:05.080 --> 24:06.340
[bang]

24:06.540 --> 24:09.580
Sorry. That was a rock, I think.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.080
Gosh, it's dark.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.420
What is this place?

24:20.620 --> 24:21.700
This is Deadloch Lake,

24:21.900 --> 24:24.780
which translates to "Deadlake Lake",
which is weird.

24:24.980 --> 24:26.780
Also it’s not even a lake,
because it connects to the sea...

24:26.980 --> 24:28.400
- Shh!
- Yes, sorry, I'm nervous.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.020
[Eddie gasps softly] Now why would you
be dumping all this product

24:35.220 --> 24:36.940
if you had nothing to hide, eh?

24:37.140 --> 24:39.640
Fucking knew it!
He's a sneaky fucker.

24:40.640 --> 24:41.980
- [Eddie] Brr...
- [gently splashing]

24:42.180 --> 24:43.300
[Abby] Is it cold, ma'am?

24:43.500 --> 24:46.040
Yeah! Me muff's frozen over!

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
Got it!

24:56.200 --> 24:58.460
[Sven, on radio]<i> So Dulce, I found you</i>
<i>a bunch of old station cameras</i>

24:58.660 --> 25:00.940
<i>that might have the Rod Dixon crime</i>
<i>scene piccy-dicks on them.</i>

25:01.140 --> 25:01.940
Oh, great.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.660
<i>Yeah, but there's no chargers for them.</i>

25:03.860 --> 25:05.500
So...

25:05.700 --> 25:08.500
That's that, I guess. Dead end.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.140
Ah, no, no, not a dead end, Sven.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.660
You go to the shops,
you get on Gumtree,

25:13.860 --> 25:16.420
you post on the Deadloch Police
Facebook page

25:16.620 --> 25:18.340
and you track down some chargers.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.140
Any word from the detective?

25:20.340 --> 25:21.740
Ah, yeah, Abby just got onto me.

25:21.940 --> 25:24.500
Apparently they are on a stakeout.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.660
What?

25:25.860 --> 25:28.340
And they got a Pro-Bro sample,
so that's great.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.980
Ah, no. Nup, not great, Sven.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.660
The woman does not have a warrant.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.140
<i>OK, bye Dulce. Ta-ta, see ya.</i>

25:35.340 --> 25:36.360
[Sven hangs up]

25:37.680 --> 25:39.700
Sexy, you picked me up!

25:39.900 --> 25:42.180
Yes, I did, I did. I picked you up.

25:42.380 --> 25:44.140
Um, how was the endurance art?

25:44.340 --> 25:45.980
Oh, God, I hated it.

25:46.180 --> 25:47.220
It was amazing.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.820
[laughs]

25:49.020 --> 25:50.540
I found somewhere
for the detective to stay.

25:50.740 --> 25:52.260
I'll sort it out, though.
Don't you stress about it.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.220
You know I love it. Let's go.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.300
I could piss for three hours.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.900
Speaking of which, did you know
we got 25mm in under an hour

25:59.100 --> 26:01.180
the other night? Huh.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.080
[starts engine]

26:11.880 --> 26:13.840
[snoring]

26:23.200 --> 26:25.260
Oh, fuck.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.940
[Dulcie clears throat]

26:27.140 --> 26:29.220
What the fuck! Stalker!

26:29.420 --> 26:31.020
- I...
- How'd you get in here?

26:31.220 --> 26:35.000
You let me in five minutes ago,
then you fell asleep again.

26:36.760 --> 26:40.080
- I'm fully nude.
- Mmm. Yeah, I am very aware.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.340
So Mike confirmed Phil's alibi.

26:43.540 --> 26:46.740
[exhales] OK, well,
ta for the big update, Sergeant.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.420
Feel free to bugger off now
if you want.

26:49.620 --> 26:51.500
No, I wanted to collect you
personally, actually,

26:51.700 --> 26:54.260
to avoid yesterday's miscommunication.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.500
I think yesterday
went really well, actually.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.580
Oh, oh, right.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.740
Yeah, you know good teamwork
is sometimes, you know,

26:59.940 --> 27:01.420
not working together, ever.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.540
Your warrant to search the sawmill
came through this morning

27:03.740 --> 27:05.580
and it was rejected
by the Commissioner,

27:05.780 --> 27:08.300
possibly because you told his...
his good friend Phil McGangus

27:08.500 --> 27:09.820
to eat some of your penis.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.340
Fuck, really? I'll have to think of
another plan, then.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.220
Oh, I know about
the stakeout, Detective,

27:14.420 --> 27:17.140
and that w... that was
just so incredibly risky.

27:17.340 --> 27:18.460
You don't know Phil.

27:18.660 --> 27:21.620
If he knew that you had followed him,
he would sue your pants off.

27:21.820 --> 27:25.460
Big risks reap big rewards,
like those astronaut monkeys.

27:25.660 --> 27:28.860
Yeah, they died in a fireball,
but they got to see space, didn't they?

27:29.060 --> 27:30.300
I want to exhume Rod Dixon's body.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.100
Oh, fuck a dead dick!

27:32.300 --> 27:33.940
I'd want Forensics
to check for similarities

27:34.140 --> 27:35.780
between the Latham brothers
and Rod Dixon.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.420
Trent's funeral's at 10am.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.260
The excavator
is already at the cemetery.

27:39.460 --> 27:41.460
We could do it discreetly this afternoon
after everybody's left.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.540
Now, obviously there won't be
any soft tissue left on the body

27:44.740 --> 27:46.860
but we could check for damage
to the hyoid and the oral cavity...

27:47.060 --> 27:49.940
You're like a fucking dog
with a boner, aren't you? I said no.

27:50.140 --> 27:51.780
Now, there is a fuck-ton of paperwork

27:51.980 --> 27:53.700
that you need to do
for Commissioner What's-his-dick.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.100
So I suggest you run along
to the station

27:56.300 --> 28:00.180
so I can wash my skanky old lady fanny
and go have a poke around.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.820
No. No. You can't... Who are you poking?
No more.

28:03.020 --> 28:03.900
None of your beeswax.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.620
- Stop the poking. Be careful...
- Have a little poke.

28:06.820 --> 28:08.500
Is that my jacket?

28:08.700 --> 28:11.140
- Nup.
- That is absolutely my...

28:11.340 --> 28:12.400
Ow!

28:15.320 --> 28:17.280
Th... [exhales]

28:23.080 --> 28:24.480
Stuff her.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.780
Ah, yeah, well,
I have Margaret's permission

28:27.980 --> 28:29.220
to exhume Rod's body, James.

28:29.420 --> 28:30.900
Just now.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.620
Well, I know that there won't be
any soft tissue left on the body

28:33.820 --> 28:36.060
but we will be able to
see if the hyoid is crushed

28:36.260 --> 28:38.980
and if there's any knife wounds
in the oral cavity, won't we?

28:39.180 --> 28:40.380
Yeah, just what I thought.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.660
OK. Alright, thanks. Gotta go. Bye.

28:42.860 --> 28:43.760
Oh my...

28:46.000 --> 28:47.080
Sven!

28:48.480 --> 28:50.180
- Sven!
- Yeah, over here!

28:50.380 --> 28:52.060
OK, station camera update.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.780
So I did five click-and-collects,

28:53.980 --> 28:55.820
raided the Buy-Sell-Swap
Facebook page,

28:56.020 --> 28:58.100
I met a guy from Gumtree on a clifftop,

28:58.300 --> 28:59.820
side bar: thought I was gonna die.

29:00.020 --> 29:02.140
Now, 22 hours later, I haven't slept,

29:02.340 --> 29:03.620
- my vision's pixelated...
- [phone buzzes]

29:03.820 --> 29:05.820
...but I have chargers
for all the cameras.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.420
Great. I need you to stop all that
and head out to Margaret's

29:08.620 --> 29:09.980
to pick up some forms.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.540
- Senior Sergeant Collins...
- Dulcie!

29:11.740 --> 29:14.980
Because of you, 16 people from
Gumtree have my private number!

29:15.180 --> 29:16.380
- Oh, hey, Ted, yeah.
- I'm a cop, Dulcie!

29:16.580 --> 29:19.220
- Thank you for calling me back.
- I am very afraid right now!

29:19.420 --> 29:21.500
Sergeant, I've tried
bulldozing the English ivy

29:21.700 --> 29:22.820
at the entrance of the station.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.020
It cannot be killed.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.640
Ah, no, Ted, I need you to
excavate a coffin for me.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.020
- Ted?
- Alright.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.620
But if anyone arkses any questions,
I want involved, OK?

29:34.820 --> 29:36.220
I'm police, Ted.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.860
Alright. Tomorrow afternoon...

40:49.140 --> 40:49.940
I've never...

40:50.140 --> 40:53.460
That was a miscommunication,
a genuine one!

40:53.660 --> 40:55.420
And if Rod Dixon's hyoid bone is broken,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.260
then it proves his death is
connected to the Lathams'.

40:57.460 --> 40:58.460
No, enough, OK?

40:58.660 --> 41:00.340
You are lucky that
I don't care about you enough

41:00.540 --> 41:03.220
to report you to Hastings for that shit
you tried to pull this morning.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.860
- You're a liability.
- Oh,<i> I'm</i> a liability?

41:06.060 --> 41:07.540
Yeah, how are you going
with the case, Detective?

41:07.740 --> 41:09.060
'Cause I'm really fascinated to see

41:09.260 --> 41:12.580
who else you think is involved in
this trans-Tasman drug ring.

41:12.780 --> 41:14.540
Is Kevin the harbour seal
in on it, maybe?

41:14.740 --> 41:15.860
Fuck up, mate!

41:16.060 --> 41:17.780
Go back to the station.
Do that work I gave you.

41:17.980 --> 41:20.820
No! You will not
shake me off, Detective.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.980
And not just because
I have a duty to the victims,

41:23.180 --> 41:25.300
not just because this is<i> my</i> town

41:25.500 --> 41:27.820
and I have memorised the street plan,

41:28.020 --> 41:30.980
but because, Detective Redcliffe,
I am your partner.

41:31.180 --> 41:33.160
And I<i> know</i> that's my jacket.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.700
- You are not my partner.
- I am.

41:36.900 --> 41:39.460
It is deeply unfortunate,
but it is the truth.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.520
I don't need a new partner.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.540
Here, have your jacket.

41:44.740 --> 41:46.640
Smells like a lavender bush
pissed on it.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.840
Shit.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.880
Ugh.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.120
[sighs]

42:28.920 --> 42:30.640
Hi. How's it going?

42:46.520 --> 42:49.460
Yeah, uh, g'day, Holly, it's um...

42:49.660 --> 42:50.980
it's me again.

42:51.180 --> 42:52.540
Ah...

42:52.740 --> 42:55.780
Yeah, look, I haven't heard back
from you about the barbecue.

42:55.980 --> 42:56.820
Um...

42:57.020 --> 42:59.020
But, actually, something's come up
down here,

42:59.220 --> 43:01.060
so I don't reckon I'm gonna...

43:01.260 --> 43:03.060
get back in time.

43:03.260 --> 43:04.740
So...

43:04.940 --> 43:07.740
uh, you might need to get someone...

43:07.940 --> 43:09.260
to bring the chops, you know,

43:09.460 --> 43:12.980
in case you were relying on me
to bring... bring the chops.

43:13.180 --> 43:17.180
But, ah, you know,
I'll be back up north soon, and...

43:17.380 --> 43:19.820
you know, we can all have
a little catch up.

43:20.020 --> 43:22.760
Have a chat about Bush, or whatever.

43:34.120 --> 43:35.420
So, yeah!

43:35.620 --> 43:38.380
Ah, you're good, and I'm good,
the case is going good.

43:38.580 --> 43:40.180
So, yeah, that's...

43:40.380 --> 43:41.960
So, anyway. Um, OK.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.520
[sighs loudly]

43:48.280 --> 43:50.920
[phone rings and buzzes]

43:53.560 --> 43:55.460
Big Eyes, what you got for me?

43:55.660 --> 43:58.360
<i>Hi, ma'am, the Pro-Bro powder</i>
<i>analysis is through.</i>

43:59.960 --> 44:01.760
[Eddie shouts] Fucking McGangus!

44:04.360 --> 44:06.940
<i>Yo, yo, this is Dr James King.</i>
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

44:07.140 --> 44:10.420
- [beep]
- James, it is Senior Sergeant Collins.

44:10.620 --> 44:14.400
Any word on Rod Dixon's autopsy?
I am here, waiting for your call.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.760
Oh, my God.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.940
Oh, fuck me!

44:47.140 --> 44:48.860
OK, kick it back.
Set up a mark for me.

44:49.060 --> 44:50.180
I don't know what that means.

44:50.380 --> 44:52.300
I told Luke Caddy that
I was part of a killer girls' squad,

44:52.500 --> 44:54.180
so don't embarrass, me, yeah?

44:54.380 --> 44:55.460
Any of you guys want a gummy?

44:55.660 --> 44:56.860
Nadiyah got them
from the market for me.

44:57.060 --> 44:59.520
No, brah, I can't do that shit anymore.
I'm going pro.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.440
Dude, they're made with weed.

45:04.360 --> 45:05.540
What?

45:05.740 --> 45:07.340
I've eaten, like, 15 of these!

45:07.540 --> 45:10.260
We know. We thought you were just
prepping for your mum's launch.

45:10.460 --> 45:11.800
We should go to that, actually.

45:13.680 --> 45:15.540
Look at that!
Straight through the sticks!

45:15.740 --> 45:18.180
Wait! What do I do?

45:18.380 --> 45:19.740
Am I gonna die?

45:19.940 --> 45:21.160
Guys!

45:22.160 --> 45:23.060
[door closes]

45:23.260 --> 45:25.020
[Eddie] Oi, McCuntus.

45:25.220 --> 45:27.180
Do your tree-necked mates know

45:27.380 --> 45:30.460
their big-boy powder's
cut with strawberry jelly crystals

45:30.660 --> 45:34.060
and pet-grade powdered milk?

45:34.260 --> 45:35.660
Yeah?

45:35.860 --> 45:38.860
Well, that got you choking on
your Pissfiddich, didn't it?

45:39.060 --> 45:40.100
Listen here,

45:40.300 --> 45:42.100
I'm not going to be in this
dick-sore of a town for very long,

45:42.300 --> 45:44.380
but I promise you, you fraudulent fuck,

45:44.580 --> 45:46.020
while I am here,

45:46.220 --> 45:48.580
I'm gonna dig into
your shonky businesses

45:48.780 --> 45:52.560
and staple-gun your nut-sack
to a fucking wall.

45:53.800 --> 45:55.380
[coughs]

45:55.580 --> 45:57.580
[♪ Live: "Lightning Crashes"]

45:57.780 --> 46:01.400
Vanessa, enough with
"Lightning Crashes". For fuck's sake!

46:03.800 --> 46:05.960
[Eddie] That's a fucking sloop.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.000
Who owns this boat?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.300
Hey, Sergeant Horsehair,
where's the footage?

46:12.500 --> 46:13.620
- What?
- The footage.

46:13.820 --> 46:15.740
- What footage? What...
- The brothers. The biffo.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.300
- What footage?
- The fight. Press play!

46:18.500 --> 46:19.740
- Come on! Come on.
- Do not touch things!

46:19.940 --> 46:21.140
Give me a little bit of space.

46:21.340 --> 46:22.960
Oh, now you want
some fucking space, do ya?

46:24.960 --> 46:28.040
Look. Look. Look at that boat.
Look at that boat.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.200
Same sloop, different paint job.

46:33.600 --> 46:36.740
- Whose boat is it?
- That is Sam O'Dwyer's boat.

46:36.940 --> 46:38.980
- No, that can't be right.
- Yeah.

46:39.180 --> 46:40.500
- I'm sure that went missing...
- [groaning]

46:40.700 --> 46:42.380
- The fuck?
- Oh, sorry don't mind me.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.300
Don't mind me!

46:44.500 --> 46:45.780
[grunts]

46:45.980 --> 46:49.420
Just taking a nap,
'cause I was up all night.

46:49.620 --> 46:51.560
Finger limes, from Margaret.

46:54.120 --> 46:56.580
Who's that? Collins?

46:56.780 --> 46:58.420
Rod Dixon.

46:58.620 --> 47:00.860
His mouth has the same markings
as the Lathams,

47:01.060 --> 47:02.560
and ligature markings
around the neck.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.980
Fuck me sideways, Collins.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.140
No, that must be a mistake.

47:07.340 --> 47:08.640
What?

47:10.720 --> 47:14.320
Sam O'Dwyer went missing five days
after Rod Dixon's body was found.

47:16.760 --> 47:19.300
Well, that's why he shot through,
isn't it?

47:19.500 --> 47:22.580
He necked your mate Dixon,
and then he did a runner.

47:22.780 --> 47:26.100
I'm sorry, was that the acknowledgement
that I was right about Rod Dixon?

47:26.300 --> 47:29.340
'Cause that was very quick and quiet,
and I think I missed it.

47:29.540 --> 47:31.700
Well, you know, actually,
I was right too. I, ah...

47:31.900 --> 47:32.740
Forgot my pillow.

47:32.940 --> 47:34.580
Yeah, I saw that picture of Sam O'Dwyer
and I was, like,

47:34.780 --> 47:35.940
"That man is pure evil."

47:36.140 --> 47:36.940
- Uh-huh.
- [squeals]

47:37.140 --> 47:38.260
Oh, my God!
There's somebody there.

47:38.460 --> 47:39.880
There's somebody there. Oh!

47:43.360 --> 47:45.140
[Eddie] That's gotta be him.

47:45.340 --> 47:47.040
[Dulcie] And he's watching them.

47:48.600 --> 47:52.440
Sam O'Dwyer is fucking back, baby.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.620
Sorry, we will let you
get back to the launch in a sec.

48:01.820 --> 48:02.900
Yeah, I need to get to the bakery.

48:03.100 --> 48:04.260
Mum, it's my launch!

48:04.460 --> 48:06.260
I'm going to make sandwiches
for everyone, Skye.

48:06.460 --> 48:07.460
The food in there's tiny.

48:07.660 --> 48:09.660
It's tiny because
it's fucking hors d'oeuvres, Mum.

48:09.860 --> 48:12.380
Sorry, just circling back,
we just have some questions about Sam.

48:12.580 --> 48:15.260
Do you know what happened to
his boat, the Loch Nessie?

48:15.460 --> 48:17.060
Well we thought he took it with him,
didn't we love?

48:17.260 --> 48:18.220
Yeah.

48:18.420 --> 48:20.740
Dad loved that boat.
It was a Bass Strait yawl?

48:20.940 --> 48:21.980
- Uh-huh.
- A sloop.

48:22.180 --> 48:24.620
Um, and... and where did he
park the sloop?

48:24.820 --> 48:26.860
He<i> moored</i> it
near our shack at the lake.

48:27.060 --> 48:27.980
Mate, what's this all about?

48:28.180 --> 48:29.980
- We're just making some enquiries...
- We think Sam's back.

48:30.180 --> 48:31.020
- No...
- What?

48:31.220 --> 48:32.540
No, we're just making
some routine enquiries,

48:32.740 --> 48:35.180
- ...trying to establish a possible...
- We reckon he's involved in
these murders

48:35.380 --> 48:36.900
that have been going on.
It's probably a vendetta.

48:37.100 --> 48:38.740
Sam got wind that
Trent, Gavin and Phil

48:38.940 --> 48:40.860
were using the gym
as a cover for drugs so,

48:41.060 --> 48:42.220
he learnt Mandarin.

48:42.420 --> 48:45.180
Sailed the seas on the Loch Nessie,
became their Asian connection,

48:45.380 --> 48:46.540
then when that all turned to shit,

48:46.740 --> 48:48.460
he came back and just
fucking necked them, you know?

48:48.660 --> 48:49.900
Sorry, that is her theory, not mine.

48:50.100 --> 48:53.900
Now, he's the boss of what we're
all calling the Deadcunt drug ring...

48:54.100 --> 48:56.580
Ah, no, we're not. Absolutely
have not signed off on that name.

48:56.780 --> 48:58.660
Sorry, you're saying that Dad
might have killed these men?

48:58.860 --> 49:00.940
No, we're just trying to establish
a possible pattern at the moment.

49:01.140 --> 49:02.140
- Oh, 100%, yeah.
- We have no...

49:02.340 --> 49:03.380
- Excuse me.
- What?

49:03.580 --> 49:05.020
The detective has run away
a little with that...

49:05.220 --> 49:06.140
Hello, hello. Sorry. Excuse me!

49:06.340 --> 49:11.380
Hello, hi. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt
this very intense conversation but,

49:11.580 --> 49:13.500
guests are starting to arrive
and I look like this.

49:13.700 --> 49:14.820
Sorry, we'll let you go.

49:15.020 --> 49:16.740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get amongst it.

49:16.940 --> 49:19.080
Safest spot for you.
Plenty of witnesses.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.940
Um, Detective, I took the liberty
of packing up your room,

49:23.140 --> 49:24.780
given you didn't actually check out.

49:24.980 --> 49:26.900
Oh, ripper! Those are my undies?

49:27.100 --> 49:28.060
Yes, yep.

49:28.260 --> 49:30.260
Uh, I found them in the kettle.

49:30.460 --> 49:32.200
Thanks for choosing the Bush Wolf.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.740
Where are you going?

49:35.940 --> 49:38.180
To the harbour office, mate,
to see if anyone's seen that boat.

49:38.380 --> 49:40.780
Sam's probably been hiding out on it
in between murders.

49:40.980 --> 49:42.660
Oh, my God,
why do you just shout everything?

49:42.860 --> 49:45.020
Can you just shush?

49:45.220 --> 49:46.820
The harbour office is shut for the day.

49:47.020 --> 49:49.540
But if Sam's transporting bodies by boat

49:49.740 --> 49:51.820
then it makes more sense
if he'd park it elsewhere.

49:52.020 --> 49:54.660
OK. Get those Carnage Bay cops
to check the moorings up the coast...

49:54.860 --> 49:57.540
Yeah, they are all drunk
at Trent's wake.

49:57.740 --> 49:59.620
Fucking small towns!

49:59.820 --> 50:01.580
Well what about O'Dwyer's old haunts?

50:01.780 --> 50:03.620
His house, his workplace?

50:03.820 --> 50:07.660
This is it. You are standing in
his old house and workplace.

50:07.860 --> 50:09.900
It'd be too risky for him to
show his face anywhere else in town.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.780
We'll start a full search
in the morning.

50:11.980 --> 50:14.020
Well what the shit am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

50:14.220 --> 50:15.540
Hey.

50:15.740 --> 50:18.900
Ah, Tom. This is Tom, my godson.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.260
Spanish croquettes?

50:21.460 --> 50:24.200
- I don't...
- Seriously, they're so good.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.820
[Cath] The Happy Plum's perfect, Dulce.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.460
We're not going to be the only ones
who can see past the fire damage.

50:31.660 --> 50:33.300
So were Gavin and Trent's deaths
linked, Dulcie?

50:33.500 --> 50:35.900
- I can't discuss the case, Aleyna...
- She doesn't really
want to talk about it.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.460
Because, you know
it'd be good if they were.

50:37.660 --> 50:38.580
Yeah, it'd be clean, Dulcie.

50:38.780 --> 50:40.700
It'd be easy to wrap it up in, what,
like, a couple of days?

50:40.900 --> 50:41.980
You could wrap it up
in a couple of days.

50:42.180 --> 50:44.500
- Let's talk about something else.
- I reckon it's drugs.

50:44.700 --> 50:47.180
- Is it drugs? Dulcie, is it drugs?
- [Dulcie sighs softly]

50:47.380 --> 50:48.600
Is Joan involved?

50:58.760 --> 51:01.160
- What's Doppelbock?
- I don't know.

51:08.800 --> 51:09.840
Ugh...

51:11.840 --> 51:13.380
Eugh.

51:13.580 --> 51:14.900
- Ray! Hi!
- Hi all.

51:15.100 --> 51:18.660
Dulce, didn't expect to see you here
tonight with the...

51:18.860 --> 51:20.260
Is, um, the detective here too?

51:20.460 --> 51:22.220
Oh, my God, the detective
digging up that grave,

51:22.420 --> 51:24.140
the complaints I had to
deal with afterwards!

51:24.340 --> 51:27.180
Yeah, don't let her do it again,
OK, Dulce? She's insane.

51:27.380 --> 51:29.220
- Mm-hm.
- And the smell of the woman!

51:29.420 --> 51:31.340
It's like an old block of parmesan
lost in a foot...

51:31.540 --> 51:33.940
Eddie, hi. I'm Cath,
I'm Dulcie's wife.

51:34.140 --> 51:37.720
I was at the beach last night. I...
I shot Kevin with a tranquiliser.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.000
How do I know you?

51:43.080 --> 51:44.780
- Have we fucked?
- Oh...

51:44.980 --> 51:47.840
- No, I saw you at the bakery today.
- Hmm.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.060
Righto, well, I'm...

51:52.260 --> 51:53.900
I'm off the clock so...

51:54.100 --> 51:55.820
are you driving me to my new digs?

51:56.020 --> 51:57.660
No, Ray can take you, can't you Ray?

51:57.860 --> 52:00.520
Yep. Sure, Cath. Happy to.

[phone rings]

52:57.040 --> 52:59.380
Hey, babe, I don't think
the killer used two knives.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.860
I think he used one knife
with two blades.

53:02.060 --> 53:04.440
Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry.
Coming now.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.460
[Eddie] Oh, fuck my fanny, it's cold!

53:11.660 --> 53:15.480
[Ray] Oh, so, lights are here.

53:17.680 --> 53:18.880
Found the heating.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.140
I know the owners.
That's why I know my way around.

53:23.340 --> 53:24.700
We're not together, though.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.160
I'm not with anyone.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.780
Yeah, picked the wrong town
to find true love.

53:31.980 --> 53:33.200
A lot of lesbians.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.680
<i>Lot</i> of lesbians.

53:38.160 --> 53:41.720
And I love lesbians. My best mate,
Skye, she's a lesbian.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.780
You've got Cath who's a lesbian,
Dulcie, obviously, is a lesbian,

53:45.980 --> 53:47.860
and Skye, that's Nadiyah, lesbian.

53:48.060 --> 53:49.760
A lot of the choir, also...

53:50.840 --> 53:52.120
...lesbians.

53:55.200 --> 54:00.260
So, Detective, um, how long
are you here for, do you reckon?

54:00.460 --> 54:03.140
I don't know.
Might stick around for a bit.

54:03.340 --> 54:05.660
Become a white witch.

54:05.860 --> 54:06.900
Really?

54:07.100 --> 54:08.460
- Nuh.
- No.

54:08.660 --> 54:11.260
I'm out of here the moment
Sam O'Dwyer is in cuffs.

54:11.460 --> 54:13.120
Oh. Right.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.400
OK. Ah...

54:19.000 --> 54:21.400
I am off to bed.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.360
Yep.

54:28.920 --> 54:32.740
OK, um... I will go.

54:32.940 --> 54:36.080
So, there's keys. Light.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.880
[sighs, murmurs indistinctly]

54:42.240 --> 54:43.760
You gave it a nudge.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.580
- Pretty solid, huh?
- I...

54:48.780 --> 54:51.580
Sorry I'm late. What are you two
talking about?

54:51.780 --> 54:54.940
James was just telling me about
a double-bladed knife theory of his.

54:55.140 --> 54:56.380
If the blade had two edges,

54:56.580 --> 54:59.500
it would account for the two markings
in the oral cavity.

54:59.700 --> 55:01.980
- Mm-hm.
- It's surprisingly solid.

55:02.180 --> 55:05.100
And, uh... Thanks, babe. I took a quick
look at Rod Dixon this afternoon.

55:05.300 --> 55:08.580
As we both suspected,
his hyoid was crushed.

55:08.780 --> 55:12.700
Right, well, uh, thank you for only
waiting six hours to tell me, James.

55:12.900 --> 55:16.940
Mm-hm. That is not... pet nat.
That's... something else.

55:17.140 --> 55:18.300
Do you want to take that back?

55:18.500 --> 55:20.040
[laughter]

55:22.360 --> 55:24.300
[Cath] The shack today was like a tip.

55:24.500 --> 55:27.100
Old food, beer cans,
piss all over the toilet floor.

55:27.300 --> 55:28.420
If I didn't know any better,

55:28.620 --> 55:30.820
I would have thought
some<i> man</i> lived out there.

55:31.020 --> 55:32.560
Sorry, I wasn't listening.
What shack?

55:33.560 --> 55:34.500
Vic's shack, babe.

55:34.700 --> 55:35.940
Detective Redcliffe
needed a place to stay

55:36.140 --> 55:38.180
and the shack was just sitting there,
so I thought why not?

55:38.380 --> 55:41.440
Actually, the lights were on in there
when I went for a run last week.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.240
"Olive tamponade"?

55:58.920 --> 56:00.440

56:12.080 --> 56:16.420

and welcome, everyone, to my baby,

56:17.860 --> 56:21.740
I'm so proud of what my family,
Nadiyah, Tom,

56:21.940 --> 56:23.340
yeah, there they are there,

56:23.540 --> 56:27.620
have helped a former little bush rat
to create.

56:27.820 --> 56:30.740
The Bush Wolf, the Feastival
and all of us here tonight,

56:30.940 --> 56:33.540
we're breathing new life into
my little home town.

56:33.740 --> 56:36.300
Good things are going to happen here.
I can feel it.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.000
[Woman] Shame!

56:39.400 --> 56:41.540
Shame!

56:41.740 --> 56:42.660

56:42.860 --> 56:46.140

all of this, he'd be custard.

Dis... custard.
