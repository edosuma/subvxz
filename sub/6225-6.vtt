-She's a troll.
-She's not that bad.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.277
GAIUS: Trolls are greedy and Lady
Catrina's like the rest of her kind.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.738
She lusts after
wealth and power.

00:28.821 --> 00:29.947
Uther's wealth and power.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.801
When I was forced
to flee my home,

02:13.926 --> 02:17.555
the one thing I was able to take with me
was my family seal.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.765

02:45.166 --> 02:48.377
It was Arthur's servant.

We've come to arrest him,
by order of the king.

You need to get out of here.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.039
-The King has ordered me to arrest you.
-What?

03:25.122 --> 03:27.166
Catrina's accused you
of taking her seal.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.626
But I didn't.

my quarry is long gone.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.181
Despite appearances,

04:24.265 --> 04:26.642
Merlin isn't stupid.
He must have got wind

04:26.725 --> 04:28.561

and left.

04:28.644 --> 04:31.021

Try not to worry, Gwen.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.625
That was comfortable.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.669

the trail that we left,

You should have heard the way
he spoke to me.

they were fangs,

31:02.737 --> 31:03.904
more like tusks.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.949
Yes, they are more like tusks.

31:08.451 --> 31:10.786
Not that we're saying that's
necessarily a bad thing.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.580
| just thought I ought
to point it out to you

31:12.663 --> 31:14.248
in case it'd passed you by.

31:19.295 --> 31:22.798
The next person
to insult Queen Catrina

31:24.341 --> 31:28.095
will be charged with treason
and beheaded

31:28.179 --> 31:30.931
according to
the laws of the land.

31:34.435 --> 31:37.605
Uther must be enchanted
it's the only explanation.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.440
Which is why we
have to find a way to break it.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.942
You won't find anything
in your magic books,

31:42.318 --> 31:44.487
troll enchantments
are too strong.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.199
Then what are we going to do?

31:49.366 --> 31:50.701
You must speak to the Dragon.

31:51.368 --> 31:54.205
If there is a way to
break Catrina's hold on Uther,

31:54.497 --> 31:56.832
he will know it.
But be careful.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.628
Dragon's and trolls have been
close allies in the past.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.015
(GRUNTING)

32:14.016 --> 32:15.518
Oh. (SNIFFS)

32:16.852 --> 32:18.562
Is everything
to your satisfaction?

32:20.689 --> 32:22.358
Uh, no,

32:23.150 --> 32:25.277

to go for a start.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.737

It's made for midgets,

32:29.198 --> 32:32.034

not my taste at all.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.245
What can I get you instead?

32:36.038 --> 32:39.041

the grounds this morning

32:39.166 --> 32:40.960

32:41.043 --> 32:44.046
that your stables have
just been mucked out.

32:45.214 --> 32:48.843
It seems such a waste
to throw away all that lovely dung.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.221
(LAUGHING)

32:57.184 --> 32:58.519
This isn't funny.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.855
Oh, it is. It is.

33:00.938 --> 33:04.108
The thought of Uther
marrying a troll.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.194
Was it a very public affair?

33:07.278 --> 33:08.404
Public enough.

33:08.571 --> 33:09.947
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

33:10.072 --> 33:11.323
Don't laugh.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.660
If she can't be stopped
Arthur won't become king.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.912
Albion will never be born.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.250
I'm sorry.
You are right of course.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.961
How can we break
the enchantment?

33:24.295 --> 33:27.339
These are not trifling tricks,

33:27.423 --> 33:29.925
troll magic is very powerful.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.260
There has to be a way.

33:31.385 --> 33:33.596
The only way you could break
this enchantment

33:33.721 --> 33:37.057
is if Uther were to cry tears
of true remorse.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.061
How do we make him do that?

33:41.145 --> 33:42.730
That I can't answer.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.983
Uther's heart
is cold as stone.

33:46.567 --> 33:48.777
He's never been
sorry for anything.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.779
Thanks. I think.

33:52.740 --> 33:53.782
Young warlock!

33:57.411 --> 34:00.831
It was some time ago
you promised to set me free.

34:02.458 --> 34:05.628
The help I give is
not unconditional.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.302
(CATRINA LAUGHING GLEEFULLY)

34:27.608 --> 34:28.984
That is for you.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.612
Now tell them about
our plans, beloved.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.114
We're introducing further taxes.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.451
Sire, we can't.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.328
The people have
given all they can.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.163
You told me that before,

34:41.288 --> 34:43.373
-and yet our coffer is full.
-(FARTS AUDIBLY)

Your people are
already going hungry.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.212
Are you questioning my orders?

34:48.337 --> 34:49.755
It's just...

34:49.838 --> 34:51.297
If we take more
they'll starve.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.344
Who are you to tell me
what's best for my people?

34:55.469 --> 34:57.429
You will collect more taxes,

34:57.513 --> 34:59.306
or you will lose your head.

(CATRINA CHUCKLES)

-Yes, Sire.
-Oh, good.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.822
Now tell this Ba yard

35:14.905 --> 35:17.366
Lots of lovely shiny gold.

35:21.578 --> 35:22.830

To respectfully decline
his offer of a visit.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.755
I'm still not sure
that we can trust Ba yard.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.216
Nonsense,

35:34.341 --> 35:35.426
You will send our reply.

It will be an honor

35:37.720 --> 35:38.846
Honor.

35:40.055 --> 35:43.017
The Dragon said he had
to cry tears of true remorse

35:43.100 --> 35:44.601
to break the enchantment.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.437
Well, that's not going
to be easy.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.314
Uther's heart is

Not everyone.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.574
Then there's only one
course of action we can take.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.910
Uther must see his son die.

No, of course not. No.

No, well, yes...

37:13.607 --> 37:15.317
Not exactly.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.656

of death

37:20.739 --> 37:22.574

37:25.494 --> 37:27.663
It's fine, there's nothing
to worry about.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.665

Oh. Only to the brink.

about me anymore.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.269

of the antidote

the effects immediately.

it was important.

wasn't important.
