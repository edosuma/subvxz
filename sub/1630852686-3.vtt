WEBVTT

00:15.516 --> 00:18.519
‐ Son, this is the story of the time

00:18.519 --> 00:22.147
I tried to help someone else
fix all their dating problems

00:22.147 --> 00:24.066
through the magic of photography.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.692
SOPHIE'S SON :
I feel like we've derailed.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.446
‐ I gave you life.
You give me one night.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.116
Now, back in 2022,

00:33.116 --> 00:36.662
having the perfect profile photo
was a very big deal.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.248
‐ Ugh. All my photos are terrible.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.208
Forget it! I'm not joining Tinder.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.585
I'll just die alone or with Sid.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.964
‐ What? No, dude. Hannah and I plan on
dying at the exact same time at 98...

00:47.923 --> 00:49.675
mid‐penetrayshe.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.594
And you were not invited to that party.
‐ That's fine!

00:52.594 --> 00:54.596
Alone it is. Anything's better

00:54.596 --> 00:57.057
than joining these ridiculous apps.
Why?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.226
You'd do great on the apps.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.144
You're a cool, handsome musician.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.772
‐ Well, thank you, but no.

01:03.772 --> 01:07.401
Actually, what I am is a part‐time
music teacher who drives Uber

01:07.401 --> 01:10.445
and is internet famous for
his rejected marriage proposal.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.906
‐ Look, if I join Tinder,
I'm just going to get a bunch

01:12.906 --> 01:16.034
of mean messages from people that
recognize me as the Proposal Fail Guy.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.705
I mean, l‐l‐let's just take a glimpse
at my Instagram DMs, shall we?

01:19.705 --> 01:22.249
Uh... "You don't deserve to have balls."

01:23.750 --> 01:25.586
Uh, "LOL, you suck."

01:25.586 --> 01:27.921
But "suck" is spelled with five k's.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.382
Uh, "You have kind eyes."

01:30.382 --> 01:32.718
Okay, well, that one doesn't count
'cause it's from our Aunt Karen.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.055
‐ You know, who cares about
random internet trolls?

01:37.055 --> 01:40.684
Jesse, I've been out with
87 app guys this year.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.643
‐ 88.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.730
Oh, it was 87 before
you struck out with Ian,

01:44.730 --> 01:47.149
so now, technically, it's 88.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.775
‐ Oh, got it. Thanks.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.570
88 guys, okay,

01:51.570 --> 01:53.697
and I haven't given up on finding someone.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.200
I refuse to let you quit before
you've even gotten started.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.993
‐ I don't know...
‐ I say

01:57.993 --> 02:00.120
if you don't want to join Tinder,
don't join.

02:00.120 --> 02:00.871
‐ Thank you!

02:00.871 --> 02:03.624
‐ You can always spend
your Saturday nights with...

02:03.624 --> 02:05.584
Postmates and Pornhub.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.668
‐ Ugh, stop.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.879
‐ Your Kung Pao shrimp in one hand,

02:08.879 --> 02:09.963
your man shrimp in the other...

02:10.964 --> 02:13.550
‐ Soy sauce dripping on
your downtown dumpling‐‐

02:13.550 --> 02:16.428
‐ Okay! Fine! I'll join!

02:16.428 --> 02:19.348
‐ You know what? I'm going
to help you crush on Tinder.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.975
If there's one thing I know from my 87‐‐
‐ 88.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.435
‐ We get it! You can count!

02:24.269 --> 02:26.480
88 app guys,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.483
it's how to create a profile
that makes a girl swipe right.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.276
Let me do this for you, Jesse.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.402
Repeat after me.

02:32.402 --> 02:36.365
"Today is the first chapter
of my next great love story."

02:36.365 --> 02:38.534
‐ Okay. I'm never going to say that,

02:38.534 --> 02:40.702
but I will accept your weird offer.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.246
‐ Great! Okay, first,

02:42.246 --> 02:45.207
I have to take the greatest photo
of you ever for your profile.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.333
‐ Mm‐hmm.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.960
‐ You're gonna be drowning
in internet honeys.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.587
You're going to be like, "I can't breathe!
There's too many honeys!"

02:50.587 --> 02:51.922
‐ Okay.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.340
Uh, well, I teach music classes tomorrow,

02:53.340 --> 02:54.883
but maybe we could do it
during my lunch break?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.552
‐ Perfect. I'll meet you there.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.305
Jesse, life's gonna be alright.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.057
‐ Life's a nightmare.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.810
‐ Aw, babe. No luck apartment hunting?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.396
‐ No. Turns out, searching
for apartments in this city

03:07.396 --> 03:09.523
without access to your
trust fund's impossible.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.025
I have no idea how you poors did it.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.862
‐ Charlie! We've talked about
using "poor" as a noun.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.572
ELLEN:
Charlie's right.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.240
I'm looking for a place, too.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.410
I just got my harvest check from
the farm I share with my ex.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.288
Our love may have wilted,
but our butter lettuce is poppin'.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.915
‐ Wait, you still get farm money?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.292
Why aren't you paying us rent?

03:28.292 --> 03:30.502
‐ Because I'm on my way out.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.503
I gotta be.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.838
‐ Mikey!

03:32.838 --> 03:35.215
You tell your mom
your bedtime is bullshit, okay?

03:35.215 --> 03:38.093
‐ Stop crying, Mikey!

03:38.093 --> 03:40.012
‐ Why don't you and Charlie shack up?

03:40.012 --> 03:42.181
Because you can afford a way
better place with a roommate.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.474
‐ Oh my god, let's do it! Alright.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.477
Should we get a grand piano
or a normal piano? Hm? Who am I kidding?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.354
If you're going to get a piano,
you might as well go big.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.898
Alright, grand it is.
Sorry.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.109
‐ I'm not really a... roommate person.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.237
‐ All good, you know.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.615
Because I very much see myself
as a lone wolf anyway.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.868
Solitary and... and serious.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.328
Often nude...

04:04.328 --> 04:06.747
‐ I'm sure you can find someone
else to be your roommate‐‐

04:06.747 --> 04:08.248
‐ I did say, "all good."

04:12.461 --> 04:13.754
‐ Let's do this!

04:14.338 --> 04:16.381
Okay, repeat after me.
"Today is the first chapter"‐‐

04:16.381 --> 04:17.841
‐ Never gonna say it.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.928
‐ Well, relax your body.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.055
Shake it out a little.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.724
Angle towards me.
‐ Alright, ready? How's this?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.564
‐ Um, why are you looking up?

04:32.564 --> 04:34.107
‐ It's my go‐to look.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.526
I have a really prominent Adam's apple,

04:35.526 --> 04:37.194
which I have heard on good authority women

04:37.194 --> 04:38.862
find irresistible.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.072
‐ What women?

04:40.697 --> 04:43.116
‐ Not my mom,
if that's what you're thinking.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.078
‐ Okay. Maybe posing is not our friend.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.455
Let's‐let's do something,
like, a little more natural.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.666
We could, um...

04:51.416 --> 04:53.794
And you're unpacking hummus.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.921
‐ Yeah. Let's get some
of me snacking, right?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.214
And make sure you get the backpack,

04:57.214 --> 04:59.132
so it's clear that I packed
this hummus myself

04:59.132 --> 05:01.802
because backpack hummus
says that I'm prepared,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.096
frugal, and health conscious.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.014
‐ Your mom tell you that, too?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.017
‐ Fine. No hummus.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.395
But just make sure to get my teeth, okay?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.689
I didn't do two rounds
of Invisalign for nothing.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.490
‐ What's that?
‐ Package from Hannah.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.950
Probably our HelloFresh meal for tonight.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.370
We do weekly FaceTime
cooking dates to stay connected.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.788
I think tonight we're making baked cod.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.791
‐ That's your secret to
a happy long‐distance relationship?

05:32.791 --> 05:34.751
Watching each other eat fish?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.754
‐ "Thought we could
spice things up tonight."

05:37.754 --> 05:39.840
Hm, spice things up? What is this?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.425
A last‐minute switch to Thai?

05:41.425 --> 05:43.594
She is so bad.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.724
The Vyper Ace Interactive Male... Stroker?

05:49.766 --> 05:50.767
What is this?

05:51.476 --> 05:54.229
‐ She sent you a sex toy.
And not just any sex toy.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.191
That is the Birkin bag
of sex toys. It has...

05:57.191 --> 05:58.692
three motors.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.611
‐ So fire.
‐ What?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.237
‐ Hey, I gotta record my podcast.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.239
I'll be back in, like, three hours.
Okay...

06:05.908 --> 06:08.202
‐ This thing? Game changer.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.578
So, there's a separate toy for her,

06:09.578 --> 06:12.164
and you can control each
other's devices with an app.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.125
‐ I don't know.
I'm not really a sex toy guy.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.002
I'm not even a toy guy.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.297
I had a bad experience with
a Lego astronaut as a kid.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.091
He got lost... inside me.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.385
‐ Look... I don't care

06:25.385 --> 06:27.888
if you stuffed a Lego astronaut
up your butt when you were little.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.557
‐ What? I didn't do that.
I swallowed it.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.600
‐ With your butt?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.271
‐ I'm just gonna text Hannah
and tell her I can't do this.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.689
‐ Uh‐uh‐uh! Sid,

06:37.689 --> 06:41.026
Hannah is trying to keep things
fresh and fun and hot

06:41.026 --> 06:42.444
from 3,000 miles away!

06:42.444 --> 06:45.447
She is putting herself out there,
so you need to put yourself in there.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.910
‐ Yeah, you're right, you're right. Okay.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.954
Okay. Okay!

06:51.954 --> 06:54.081
So, what? Li'l Sid just...

06:54.081 --> 06:55.707
goes into the black tube?

06:55.707 --> 06:58.293
‐ Your nickname for your penis
has the word "li'l" in it?

06:58.293 --> 07:01.338
‐ Yeah. It's ironic
'cause he's comically large.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.761
‐ Ellen?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.848
‐ Oh... Hey.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.683
‐ I guess we have the same taste
in apartments, huh?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.770
‐ Hey. Maybe we should
be roommates, after all.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.773
Just kidding. I know that
roommates aren't your thing.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.193
‐ Hi. I'm Ralph, Ellen's new roommate.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.864
‐ See, I thought that I... I get it.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.825
Well, Ralph must be, like, your best
childhood pal or something.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.368
‐ I met him on Craigslist an hour ago.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.954
‐ Wow. Okay, well, that is hurtful.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.956
And also dangerous.
That man could be a...

07:37.040 --> 07:38.625
:
pervert.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.627
‐ Hey, I'm a good guy.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.880
I'm going to go test out the bathtub.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.301
‐ Look, Charlie, the truth is

07:47.301 --> 07:49.219
I just don't think we'd be
a good fit to live together.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.721
I'm brand new to New York.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.223
I need to live with
someone who isn't so...

07:54.057 --> 07:55.684
‐ clueless.
‐ Clueless?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.812
I know my way around this city.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.231
I even learned to keep my mouth
closed on the subway.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.609
‐ Open your mouth for a treat.

08:05.694 --> 08:06.904
‐ Ah!

08:06.904 --> 08:09.281
That was not a treat!

08:09.281 --> 08:12.784
Yes, I got very drunk trying to
disinfect my tongue, but I learned!

08:16.622 --> 08:18.332
‐ I'm sorry, what is this now?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.501
‐ It's the Karate Kid.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.461
Alright, break's over.
You think we got it?

08:23.045 --> 08:24.254
‐ Do you think we got it?

08:25.047 --> 08:26.381
‐ Jesse!
‐ Yeah?

08:26.381 --> 08:29.635
‐ I've practicing my Twinkle Twinkle,
and it's getting really good!

08:29.635 --> 08:32.554
‐ Great! I know you've been working
really hard, and it's a complicated song.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.473
Some might say poetic.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.393
‐ Hey, kid. Do me a favor.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.812
Hold this light reflector up for me?

08:40.812 --> 08:43.315
Come on, I'll give you an Altoid.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.733
Here we go. Quick.
I don't wanna miss this shot.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.570
‐ Uh, uh, Sophie, please stop
photographing me and this child.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.614
‐ Okay, but this could actually work.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.367
Okay, you, this cute kid? This is money!

08:53.367 --> 08:54.826
MAN:
Jesse!

08:55.410 --> 08:56.662
‐ Drew.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.413
Hi. Sophie,

08:58.413 --> 09:00.165
this is Drew.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.875
The vice principal.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.378
‐ What's going on here?
‐ Oh...

09:04.378 --> 09:07.172
Jesse needs a date, real bad,

09:07.172 --> 09:09.675
and this little boy's
the only hope we've got.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.179
‐ Where's my Altoid?

09:20.185 --> 09:21.979
‐ Drew, listen‐‐
‐ Let me explain.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.897
We're taking these photos for Tinder.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.692
No, no, no, no, no.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.735
For Jesse's Tinder!

09:28.735 --> 09:31.655
To get him dates!
We are not trying to get children dates.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.282
I am very much against children dating.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.785
‐ So, this was all just to get
Jesse a new Tinder profile pic?

09:36.785 --> 09:39.621
‐ Yes.
‐ Good luck with that.

09:39.621 --> 09:43.083
Jesse's signature looking‐up face
ruined the faculty photo this year.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.086
It‐it was like he was seeing an airplane
for the very first time.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.629
‐ I know, right?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.882
"My god, a flying machine.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.925
Whatever will they think of next?"

09:54.428 --> 09:56.930
‐ Hey, have we met before?
You‐you look familiar.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.601
‐ I don't think so.
I have one of those faces.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.478
‐ Oh, I‐I don't think you have
one of those faces. I...

10:03.478 --> 10:05.147
I think you have
a singularly great face.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.818
Uh, I should go.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.570
Sophie, it's very nice to meet you.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.824
I do need to ask you to leave
the premises immediately.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.326
But it was very nice meeting you.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.996
‐ You, too. I understand.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.876
‐ Wow. He was super into you,

10:25.876 --> 10:28.712
even though you were giving off
strong Amber Alert vibes.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.506
‐ Really? You think so?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.468
‐ Doesn't matter.
Today is "help Jesse find love" day.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.470
‐ Yeah, Jesse's done, okay?

10:36.470 --> 10:39.598
‐ Stop. Okay, okay,
maybe the apps aren't your vibe.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.726
Legend has it, occasionally,

10:42.726 --> 10:44.353
people still meet in real life.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.064
Come on. Let's go to a bar.
I'll be your wingman.

10:47.064 --> 10:47.981
‐ I can't.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.150
‐ Stop making excuses,
and let me help you.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.151
‐ I'm not making excuses.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.071
It's 1:30 PM on a Tuesday.
I'm at work.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.572
‐ Right.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.991
Okay. We'll go later.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.080
Normal work hours are so random.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.126
Remember, the camera adds 10 pounds,

11:08.126 --> 11:10.838
so your best angle naked
is from high up.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.341
But, not too high!
You don't want Li'l Sid to get too li'l.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.885
‐ Okay. Wow.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.263
I mean, you could give a TED Talk
on cross‐country coitus.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.973
‐ Aw, you're sweet.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.933
I've been in a ton of LDRs.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.893
I was in a pretty serious one
with the ambassador to Peru.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.272
And then, I had a very hot thing
with a Polish pilot.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.941
It is true what they say
about the Polish.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.444
‐ No idea what they say, but wow.
You have lived a life.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.613
‐ Alright!

11:36.613 --> 11:39.449
I think my work here is done.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.288
‐ Ah!
‐ Get it!

11:44.288 --> 11:45.664
- I'm trying!
- Well, try harder!

11:45.664 --> 11:48.125
‐ Well, I didn't think
it'd play hard to get!

11:50.836 --> 11:51.879
‐ Good day.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.008
‐ I know that you have many
interested parties, such as her,

11:56.008 --> 11:58.177
but I want this apartment so much,

11:58.177 --> 12:00.679
I'm prepared to pay a year's cash upfront

12:00.679 --> 12:02.890
and five percent over the asking.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.726
‐ Let me think about that‐‐
Okay, yes, deal.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.398
‐ I thought you said
you didn't have any money.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.610
‐ Well, I realized that
I can pawn my gold spoon.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.653
‐ This is exactly
what I was talking about.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.947
I don't want to live
with some clueless rich guy

12:18.947 --> 12:22.868
who was born with a literal
gold spoon in his mouth! Come on, Ralph!

12:23.744 --> 12:24.912
‐ Not cool.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.581
‐ I wasn't born with it in my mouth.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.876
It was gently placed in my hand
while I napped in my diamond crib.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.923
You can't put a gold spoon
in a baby's mouth.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.717
Choking hazard.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.434
‐ It's Drew. He's asking
for your phone number.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.270
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah, should I give it to him?

12:51.605 --> 12:54.691
‐ Nah, no. He's not really my type.
‐ Really?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.652
You guys were all giggling and smiling

12:56.652 --> 12:58.570
and talking about
how singular your face is.

12:59.029 --> 13:02.199
‐ I said I'm good. Now, stop trying
to change the subject, okay?

13:02.824 --> 13:04.201
Go talk to her.

13:05.953 --> 13:06.995
‐ And say what?

13:07.496 --> 13:09.915
‐ How about, uh... "Hey!

13:10.707 --> 13:12.960
I think you're gonna like me."
‐ So, lie to her?

13:14.336 --> 13:15.546
Fine.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.760
‐ Hey!
‐ Hey.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.305
‐ I think you're gonna like me.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.557
‐ Oh, am I?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.476
‐ Honestly, it could go either way.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.144
I mean, some people think
that I'm charming,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.647
but other people
kind of find me, like, to be a lot.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.023
Uh...

13:35.023 --> 13:36.733
I could buy you a drink
if you're interested

13:36.733 --> 13:38.819
in figuring out
which category you fit into.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.822
‐ Sure. I'll have a margarita.

13:41.822 --> 13:42.948
‐ Okay.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.496
‐ She will have a margarita.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.923
‐ Hey, babe.
Hey. Whoa,

13:59.923 --> 14:02.634
you look amazing! Great angle.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.888
‐ Really? 'Cause I didn't
even think about my setup.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.807
‐ Okay, I'm turning mine...

14:08.807 --> 14:10.225
on.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.227
‐ Okay, well, watch out 'cause soon
I'll be turning you on.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.107
Uh... Wait, something's wrong with mine.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.611
God, the WiFi in here is so bad.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.364
Come with me.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.244
Anyone home?

14:31.371 --> 14:32.623
Alright.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.417
Yeah, the signal's way better in here

14:35.417 --> 14:37.586
Okay.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.967
Let me just open the app
that controls your toy...

14:43.967 --> 14:46.303
MICHAEL BARBARO :
Today on The Daily...

14:46.303 --> 14:48.096
- This thing has a speaker!
- ...the survivor

14:48.096 --> 14:49.681
of a rare bacterial infection...

14:49.681 --> 14:52.142
‐ Is that... The Daily?
...talks to us about losing

14:52.142 --> 14:54.478
all his limbs...
‐ Yeah, I'm trying to turn it off.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.271
BARBARO:
...and most of his lower face.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.814
I'm Michael Barbaro.

14:59.858 --> 15:00.859
‐ Okay.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.152
‐ Okay.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.404
‐ Where were we?

15:08.534 --> 15:10.369
Yeah. Hannah, I can't do this.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.122
Alright, Li'l Sid's stuck
in a Chinese finger trap.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.416
Big Sid can't stop thinking about
flesh‐eating bacteria. I mean,

15:16.416 --> 15:19.336
this sucks even more than
cooking FaceTime fish!

15:19.336 --> 15:21.421
Which I have to pretend
to be psyched about once a week.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.049
‐ I know it sucks.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.802
Long‐distance relationships suck,

15:26.802 --> 15:29.221
but at least I'm trying!

15:33.517 --> 15:35.769
BARBARO:
Here's what else you need to know today.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.814
‐ No! There's nothing else I need

15:38.814 --> 15:40.190
:
to know today!

15:40.190 --> 15:41.400
Michael!

15:42.317 --> 15:44.611
‐ Uh, another drink?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.405
‐ I'd love that!
‐ Okay, great.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.705
‐ Siri. Text Fort Greene Girls.

15:54.705 --> 15:58.500
"OMG. You will not believe
was hitting on me right now!"

15:58.500 --> 16:00.878
All caps. "Proposal Fail Guy.

16:00.878 --> 16:03.505
"I literally cannot!
I'm dying!

16:03.505 --> 16:06.717
I'm gonna try to get him
to sing me his sad proposal song."

16:06.717 --> 16:07.843
L‐O‐L, exclamation,

16:07.843 --> 16:10.679
skull face, exclamation,
L‐O‐L, exclamation, skull face,

16:10.679 --> 16:12.389
exclamation, L‐O‐‐
‐ Excuse me.

16:13.098 --> 16:16.560
‐ We're getting drinks from the bar, but
I'll have a water and fries. Thank you!

16:16.560 --> 16:17.895
‐ I'm not your waitress.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.649
Okay, I get the confusion.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.652
But, this is about my friend Jesse, okay?

16:25.652 --> 16:28.030
And he is not some
punchline for you to tell

16:28.030 --> 16:30.032
your dumb friends about at boozy brunch.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.784
He's an incredible guy,
and I am killing myself

16:32.784 --> 16:34.786
to make him believe
that he will find love.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.248
Do you know how hard
it is to believe that?

16:38.248 --> 16:42.044
Do you know what it's like
to go on 87 first dates?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.462
No, 88.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.839
88 first dates and have none of them lead

16:45.839 --> 16:48.342
to anything even close
to a real relationship?

16:48.884 --> 16:51.220
Have you ever met a totally cute,

16:51.220 --> 16:52.930
nice vice principal
who wants to take you out,

16:52.930 --> 16:54.640
and all you can think about is why?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.933
What's the point?

16:55.933 --> 16:58.268
If I say yes, he's inevitably
just going to turn into

16:58.268 --> 16:59.770
failed date number 89!

17:00.646 --> 17:03.524
‐ Yes. Actually, I know
exactly what you mean.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.609
Dating in this city is killing me
and seriously‐‐

17:05.609 --> 17:08.695
‐ No! No, no, you do not get
to be relatable right now.

17:09.655 --> 17:12.241
‐ Okay, look.
Yes, I was texting my friends

17:12.241 --> 17:14.535
about meeting Proposal Fail Guy,

17:14.535 --> 17:16.453
but I still wanted to sleep with him.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.914
Uh, is the "sleeping with me" thing

17:18.914 --> 17:20.624
still on the table or...

17:20.624 --> 17:23.418
‐ No. Your mean waitress friend ruined it!

17:24.211 --> 17:25.462
‐ Waitress?

17:30.300 --> 17:32.344
‐ I think you're gonna like me.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.938
‐ Hey. Thanks for
letting me borrow all this.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.691
‐ How'd it go?
‐ Very, very poorly.

17:45.691 --> 17:48.485
‐ I can tell. If you'd used
the Vyper Ace correctly,

17:48.485 --> 17:50.487
you wouldn't be walking right now.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.906
Talk to me.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.157
‐ Um...

17:54.157 --> 17:56.076
When Hannah took the residency in LA,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.829
we promised each other we wouldn't be
like other long‐distance couples.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.456
Like, we'd make time for
our relationship, but...

18:02.583 --> 18:05.085
between her surgery rotations and me
trying to keep this bar afloat,

18:05.085 --> 18:06.545
it's just harder than
I thought it would be.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.547
To feel close to her.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.425
And I hate it. I just miss her.

18:12.718 --> 18:14.803
I just want to cook dinner in
the same room as Hannah.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.431
Or, like, read the newspaper
with her on a Sunday.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.893
Have sex with her human vagina.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.895
‐ That is so romantic.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.898
I have an idea.
‐ Yeah?

18:26.523 --> 18:28.025
‐ God, you are lucky you met me!

18:32.404 --> 18:35.282
‐ I'm sorry about tonight.
‐ That's okay.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.493
Camilla didn't look like
she was very good at sex anyway.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.830
‐ Yeah, she did.
‐ Yeah, she did.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.753
All that stuff you said to her,
that was, uh...

18:48.420 --> 18:49.713
kind of intense, huh?

18:50.631 --> 18:53.175
‐ You remember that night
when we met at the bar,

18:53.175 --> 18:56.512
and you guessed that my parents
had a really happy marriage?

18:56.512 --> 18:59.515
‐ I'm so sorry about that.
Valentina told me I was way off.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.558
‐ Yeah.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.477
You were.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.312
Hm.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.567
My childhood was kind of a mess.

19:11.443 --> 19:15.239
It was just my mom and I bouncing around
from one boyfriend's house to the next.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.826
We were more like, you know,
sisters than mother‐daughter.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.247
And I was the big sister.
‐ Oof.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.498
‐ Always...

19:25.123 --> 19:27.417
picking up the pieces after every breakup.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.380
And I got really good at fixing her.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.844
So, fixer became my go‐to mode.

19:38.512 --> 19:41.014
Especially when I can't figure out
how to fix things for myself.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.436
‐ Uh, fix things for yourself, you mean...

19:46.937 --> 19:49.940
‐ You know, like, find my person.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.735
I want to so bad,

19:53.735 --> 19:57.030
and it just... keeps not happening.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.033
‐ Okay. Sophie...

20:00.701 --> 20:04.246
Repeat after me.
"Today is the first chapter

20:04.246 --> 20:07.416
of my next great love story." Come on.

20:09.877 --> 20:12.838
‐ Today is the first chapter of my...

20:12.838 --> 20:15.841
next great love story.
‐ Next... Love story. Hell yeah.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.762
‐ Alright, this is me.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.973
Good night, Sophie.
‐ Good night, Jesse.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.400
‐ Open your mouth for a treat.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.902
‐ Not tonight, Frank.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.326
‐ Hi.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.079
‐ Hi.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.916
‐ How how's your amazing new apartment?

20:50.334 --> 20:52.002
‐ Didn't exactly work out.

20:52.461 --> 20:54.922
Smile and say, "new apartment"!

20:56.715 --> 20:58.717
‐ Alright, that was fun.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.385
How about that year of rent
you promised?

21:00.886 --> 21:02.137
‐ On it.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.807
Ah!

21:05.807 --> 21:06.934
‐ Ugh.

21:06.934 --> 21:09.895
Well, if makes you feel any better,
my day wasn't great, either.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.814
‐ Hi. I'd like to open a line of credit.

21:12.814 --> 21:16.360
My name's Ellen,
and my social security number is...

21:16.360 --> 21:19.613
‐ He bought a camcorder, a bra,
and three jars of honey

21:19.613 --> 21:21.323
before I could cancel the credit card.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.534
He was definitely a pervert.

21:24.660 --> 21:27.496
‐ Look, Ellen, I'm really sorry
I tried to steal the apartment.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.250
‐ I'm sorry for lying to you
about wanting a roommate.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.294
Maybe I don't need a grizzled
New Yorker to show me the ropes.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.713
Maybe I just need a good person

21:36.713 --> 21:38.465
who won't steal my identity,

21:38.465 --> 21:41.260
and we can figure out
how to crush the city together.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.638
I mean, if you'd still have me?

21:44.638 --> 21:47.891
‐ Absolutely. Together,
we will take this city by storm.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.352
We are not afraid of you, New York.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.271
‐ We're the bravest people in the city!

22:01.238 --> 22:02.948
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi!

22:03.615 --> 22:05.325
What are you doing here?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.828
‐ This is me, uh, trying.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.712
‐ That is so sweet.

22:16.712 --> 22:19.756
But, that last‐minute flight
must have cost you a fortune.

22:19.756 --> 22:23.093
‐ Not really. I mean, it's a long story,
but I got hooked up.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.304
I have this friend who was
in a long‐distance relationship

22:25.304 --> 22:27.306
with a Polish pilot. Yeah.
‐ Huh...

22:28.265 --> 22:30.934
‐ Like I said, back in 2022,

22:30.934 --> 22:34.354
having a great profile photo
was essential,

22:34.354 --> 22:37.399
but it wasn't everything.
You also had to be willing

22:37.399 --> 22:39.026
to put yourself out there,

22:39.026 --> 22:41.320
time and time again,

22:41.320 --> 22:44.615
even when you just wanted
to curl up under a blanket

22:44.615 --> 22:46.575
with a box of Froot Loops,

22:46.575 --> 22:48.452
a box of wine,

22:48.452 --> 22:51.288
and some unboxing videos.

22:51.288 --> 22:53.290
SOPHIE'S SON:
What the hell is an unboxing video?

22:55.209 --> 22:56.752
‐ For a brief time, when I was younger,

22:56.752 --> 22:58.795
everyone was very into watching

22:58.795 --> 23:01.006
other people open stuff on camera.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.051
SOPHIE'S SON: Sounds dark.
‐ Mm, it was.

23:05.928 --> 23:07.471
But, anyway...

23:48.303 --> 23:49.304
‐ Hello?

23:49.304 --> 23:52.474
‐ Hi, Drew. It's Sophie,

23:52.474 --> 23:54.101
Jesse's photographer friend.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.853
‐ Oh. Hi.

23:56.937 --> 24:00.315
‐ Jesse said that you
asked for my number, so...

24:00.315 --> 24:02.568
well, I thought I'd beat you to the punch.

24:02.568 --> 24:05.279
‐ Oh, amazing.
You know, I was going crazy

24:05.279 --> 24:06.864
trying to figure out
where I know you from,

24:06.864 --> 24:08.740
and then I realized that we met

24:08.740 --> 24:10.701
at Sid and Hannah's engagement party.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.202
‐ We did?

24:14.580 --> 24:16.164
Excuse me!
You wouldn't happen to have

24:16.164 --> 24:17.916
a cell phone charger handy, would you?

24:17.916 --> 24:21.044
‐ Oh, uh, yeah.
Never leave home without it.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.838
‐ Thanks!

24:22.838 --> 24:25.007
‐ Yeah. Yeah, Hannah's a college friend.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.219
So, uh, what are you doing Friday night?

24:29.928 --> 24:31.513
‐ Having dinner with you.
