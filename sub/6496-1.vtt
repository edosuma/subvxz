00:31.033 --> 00:34.324
Elsa, sweetheart, I know you too well.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.706
You tell me everything.

00:38.573 --> 00:41.623
Do the bombs closer?

00:44.718 --> 00:48.674
We could you and the children
further inland to pass.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.286
Yes, let me speak to him.

00:57.313 --> 00:58.584
What?

01:01.458 --> 01:02.876
I.

01:07.939 --> 01:09.688
Uli?

01:10.751 --> 01:15.086
I did not know you were promoted to field marshal.

01:16.367 --> 01:20.401
Max would not really
Field Marshal may tease.

01:23.705 --> 01:26.873
Customize your good to your mother?

01:27.039 --> 01:30.276
Now you're the man of the house.

01:31.142 --> 01:33.662
On your marks!

01:33.763 --> 01:38.395
Do not cry, Uli.
All is well.

01:39.369 --> 01:42.511
Everyone is sometimes afraid, Uli.

01:44.760 --> 01:49.717
Watch.
Make a eagle. I do it too.

01:51.666 --> 01:55.756
High from heaven.
On rocks and hills...

01:55.764 --> 01:58.562
Sees both of us...

01:59.697 --> 02:02.734
And keeps us safe.

02:07.782 --> 02:11.314
I love you too.

02:49.664 --> 02:51.586
Preparing.

02:54.068 --> 02:55.820
Aim.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.304

Two months after D-Day Start
the Allies with Operation Dragoon.

03:53.773 --> 03:57.023
The goal was to occupy southern France.

03:57.794 --> 04:03.544
517de The Parachute Regiment combat
was used for this purpose.

04:06.461 --> 04:09.185

Provence, France
5:03 pm

04:45.099 --> 04:48.165
Jump over five minutes.
Get ready!

05:37.590 --> 05:40.878
Please note that the Americans.

05:55.108 --> 05:57.657
Stay together.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.746
Stand up. Hands up.
- Do not shoot.

07:34.928 --> 07:37.975
Do not shoot!
- Come here.

07:43.628 --> 07:45.164
Do not shoot.

07:46.106 --> 07:47.360
Do not shoot.

07:58.892 --> 08:00.672
What have we here?

08:02.498 --> 08:03.948
What is that?

08:17.958 --> 08:21.182
Where is your unit?
Tell me!

08:21.696 --> 08:23.654
On your knees.

08:25.092 --> 08:26.754
Are you alone?

08:32.544 --> 08:34.058
Are you alone?

08:37.042 --> 08:38.812
Grenade!

09:04.577 --> 09:07.281
Never been so happy to see you.

09:08.665 --> 09:10.889
I'm alone.
- What?

09:11.565 --> 09:13.042
I'm alone.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.214
Where's the rest of your unit?

09:15.315 --> 09:17.714
No idea.
Where's the rest of yours?

09:17.860 --> 09:21.102
My name is Curtis.
- I'm Rossi.

09:21.788 --> 09:23.330
Thank you.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.578
Pleasure.

09:26.926 --> 09:31.207
What are you looking for?
- I promised my buddy a souvenir.

09:31.426 --> 09:34.911
A SS skull ring, Luger,
or something.

09:35.215 --> 09:38.633
I have no idea where the landing zone from here.

09:38.734 --> 09:41.974
You got a compass?
- Yes, I have.

09:42.075 --> 09:43.452
Give me a minute.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.790
Where is yours?
- Lost in the jump.

09:51.174 --> 09:56.362
This sleeve was faster than I expected.
A drop in the night gives a rough landing.

09:56.428 --> 09:58.270
This mountain range there...

09:58.722 --> 10:00.838
Says that we are here.

10:00.873 --> 10:02.954
More than 20 km from the landing zone.

10:03.364 --> 10:06.819
How is it that we so far have landed?
- Blame it on the scouts.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.705
When I jumped, I swear to you, for giving me
above the sea already left jump.

10:09.806 --> 10:11.554
That was hellish.

10:11.929 --> 10:17.431
I hope they wait for us in Les Arcs.
- That is 3 km past the landing zone.

10:17.532 --> 10:20.375
Here, we better go.
Are you ready?

10:20.476 --> 10:22.857
Yes, only grab my gun.

11:06.486 --> 11:07.760
Rossi!

11:08.033 --> 11:09.485
Okay.

11:10.489 --> 11:13.127
Let's see.
I'll go first.

11:13.999 --> 11:17.347
No, I will go.
And you give me coverage.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.601
Okay. Go ahead.

12:29.976 --> 12:31.331
Do not move.

12:31.514 --> 12:33.697
Democracy.
- Lafayette.

12:33.798 --> 12:35.399
Curtis?

12:35.553 --> 12:37.199
Sergeant?

12:39.243 --> 12:42.929
Are you but two?
- We could not find anyone else.

12:43.030 --> 12:46.565
This is Corporal Rossi.
- Sergeant Jones, Bravo Company.

13:00.699 --> 13:03.213
What are you singing?

13:03.222 --> 13:05.327
This is an old song.

13:05.453 --> 13:08.927
That's not really uplifting.
Can you remember anything else?

13:10.803 --> 13:13.637
Not directly.
- What happened to you?

13:16.553 --> 13:20.784
My platoon did.
Seemed like a good idea when.

13:20.885 --> 13:25.327
What would your mother think? If everyone
of a bridge jump, do you do it?

13:25.428 --> 13:29.242
All my friends jump out of airplanes.
That's pretty much the same.

13:29.343 --> 13:33.577
What is the reason that there should be?
- It's a warrior thing.

13:33.678 --> 13:35.585
Ten battle.

13:35.993 --> 13:39.566
I'd best explain it, but do not
that you would understand.

13:40.681 --> 13:42.758
Also good.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.321
What are we gonna do, Sergeant?

13:48.739 --> 13:54.387
We can not just sit here and wait.
The Germans will broadcast patrols.

13:54.488 --> 13:58.049
Who knows how long it takes for us is our unity.

13:58.506 --> 14:02.480
The battalion would have to meet in Les Arcs.
That's what we do.

14:02.521 --> 14:05.926
With luck we are in the evening.
- How far is that?

14:06.027 --> 14:07.694
I would say...

14:09.126 --> 14:12.286
A 19 kilometer.
- I need to know in miles.

14:12.337 --> 14:15.760
Can not convert kilometers in miles?
That was one of the first lessons.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.612
They gave lessons in there, but
I have no lesson learned.

14:21.062 --> 14:24.258
This is... about eleven miles.

14:25.678 --> 14:29.630
I do not know what you think, but I
joined the paratroopers to be properly disposed.

14:29.731 --> 14:33.054
Not that I should wear my shoes
to have to search.

14:33.895 --> 14:36.557
Way we will probably encounter a lot of Germans.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.745
Yes, like you assume.

14:39.745 --> 14:43.968
We'll have to improvise.
What did Colonel Graves again?

14:44.069 --> 14:49.161
<i> A few men can really make much
problems as they are on the right place. </ I></i>

14:49.957 --> 14:53.297
We do what we practiced.
Then we get it.

14:55.387 --> 14:58.723
Why we're here, is not it gentlemen?
A plane jump...

14:58.824 --> 15:01.993
Countries behind enemy lines in the middle of the night.

15:02.094 --> 15:06.053
And all for $ 50 extra per month.

15:06.125 --> 15:09.174
I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.052
I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

15:12.153 --> 15:15.997
I give this to me as a volunteer,
I've known the dangers all too well.

15:16.247 --> 15:20.249
<i> I serve a mighty force,
famous for his actions during war... </ i></i>

15:20.300 --> 15:25.546
<i> known for its usability and peace.
It is my honor and prestige oath to uphold... </ i></i>

15:25.597 --> 15:29.439
<i> in everything I am and do. </ I></i>

15:34.650 --> 15:37.408
I said to myself every day.

15:38.628 --> 15:43.274
Why not surprise me that, Curtis?
Let you feel invincible?

15:44.022 --> 15:48.477
When I was little, I went with friends
to the pier at the beach of Long Beach.

15:48.504 --> 15:51.688
There was a roller coaster.
- Cyclone Racer.

15:51.789 --> 15:54.806
The Cyclone Racer, you know him!
- Yes, that is famous.

15:54.841 --> 15:58.323
They say the first fall is so steep,
thing people are dying.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.213
Yes, exactly.
We bought our tickets.

16:01.314 --> 16:04.371
We ran the first place.
And when we left...

16:04.422 --> 16:08.585
We went that steep slope.
We made the security release...

16:08.636 --> 16:12.164
And climbed onto the front of it trolley
and dangled our legs over.

16:12.199 --> 16:13.569
And then suddenly...

16:13.919 --> 16:15.689
160 km per hour.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.797
Your legs tremble and I think to myself,
I'm coming!

16:18.848 --> 16:21.986
I'm going to lose weight and fall to pieces.

16:22.021 --> 16:26.360
Could not you have anything less adventurous can do
like a mohawk your hair do?

16:26.411 --> 16:27.931
It gets better.

16:28.023 --> 16:32.113
At the moment we come out of that first dive,
we climb out of the front cart...

16:32.164 --> 16:35.552
And go back.
By the time that the ride to an end...

16:35.553 --> 16:38.305
Seated completely in the last carriage.

16:38.406 --> 16:40.655
Do not sure why I did it.

16:41.655 --> 16:44.688
Maybe I liked
to the death to outsmart.

16:45.806 --> 16:50.062
Was that the story you told
to the 517de to get?

16:50.244 --> 16:52.028
Should I disagree.

16:52.129 --> 16:55.999
Major siez looked at me once to
and knew that I was perfect.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.561
Keep going.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.250
Have you ever heard of that Nazi Aryan babies?

18:37.351 --> 18:40.568
No, tell me.

18:40.592 --> 18:44.013
Nazi Hitler want a pure race, right?
- Yes.

18:44.932 --> 18:48.876
So he looks for people with Aryan features
and take their babies away.

18:48.977 --> 18:52.540
Once they are born, comes the Third Reich
to come and take them away.

18:52.692 --> 18:56.696
Nazis come in and take the baby away
from their mothers when they are born?

18:56.797 --> 19:01.115
Yes, that is correct. Hitler has those places where he
all those young Aryan people gather...

19:01.166 --> 19:06.106
Nazis to small babies to make.
As a factory, they are like horses bred.

19:06.338 --> 19:09.618
They do some tests.
Put them in a room together.

19:09.854 --> 19:12.800
They have never met each other,
they know each other at all.

19:12.851 --> 19:16.658
Not "delicious perfume, nice to meet you"?
- No, nothing like that.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.484
Throw balboekje out
and there is the door.

19:19.585 --> 19:22.954
I've got to admit, I did not know
.

19:23.055 --> 19:24.263
Wait.

19:26.019 --> 19:30.165
You know, they have a name
for such places.

19:30.266 --> 19:33.758
Yes, but those places are not directly intended
for kids to make.

19:33.859 --> 19:38.706
Kids who grow up, put on uniforms,
conquer the world, our guys dead...

19:38.848 --> 19:43.303
They will foot the bill.
If not in this life then in the afterlife.

19:43.354 --> 19:46.786
You really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure.

20:21.075 --> 20:24.117
Wait.
I want the map view.

20:42.531 --> 20:44.344
Now look.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.159
What do you think?
Is it me?

20:49.023 --> 20:50.477
It is short...

20:50.821 --> 20:52.623
But handsome.

20:53.574 --> 20:56.092
My own handsome soldier.

21:02.127 --> 21:03.843
They are beautiful.

21:04.289 --> 21:06.329
Is that for me?

21:07.045 --> 21:10.043
I do not know.
Is yet to be seen.

21:12.346 --> 21:15.724
Hey, handsome.
Do you even open the door?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.242
Careful.
- Thank you.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.357
Beware of your head.

21:22.999 --> 21:26.515
Good. We can continue.

21:38.617 --> 21:41.563
What do you think if we jump?
- What do you mean?

21:43.881 --> 21:47.281
You know, where do you think
if you jump from the plane?

21:47.867 --> 21:51.263
Some count the seconds before they hit the ground...

21:51.364 --> 21:55.332
Others think about how they are going to die.

21:55.433 --> 21:57.215
Just want to know what you think.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.155
I actually think of anything.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.679
To what do you think?

22:04.239 --> 22:06.721
Mostly about my girlfriend, Charlotte.

22:07.983 --> 22:10.927
This seems mostly to calm.

22:25.657 --> 22:27.663
What are you doing?

22:27.714 --> 22:29.649
There is a pebble in my shoe.

22:29.770 --> 22:31.382
Throw it.

23:00.511 --> 23:02.063
All clear.

23:03.690 --> 23:06.792
I think you got him to graze.

23:10.832 --> 23:13.715
Damn pebble in my shoe.

23:13.874 --> 23:15.615
You know, Rossi?

23:15.803 --> 23:18.757
I'm going to recommend this
for a medal.

23:18.879 --> 23:21.641
Go in search of your Luger, Gates.

23:24.135 --> 23:28.193
Let's see what you were doing,
you naughty, naughty Germans.

23:29.749 --> 23:31.581
What do we have here.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.819
Guess whose face at work I look.

23:38.595 --> 23:42.269
Please mein Fuhrer beautiful.

23:51.189 --> 23:55.443
What have we passed, 5 to 6 km?
What do you think, Curtis?

23:57.011 --> 24:00.339
I think so about.
- How much is that in miles?

24:00.605 --> 24:03.043
Multiply it by 0.62.

24:04.335 --> 24:08.799
I was never good at math.
Probably because I'm kicked out of school so much.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.583
Why?
- Usually by fighting.

24:11.940 --> 24:14.149
I've seen you fight.

24:14.331 --> 24:16.431
Really? Where?

24:16.797 --> 24:20.898
Camp McCall.
You had the record for the most knockouts.

24:20.949 --> 24:22.771
Right?
- Yeah, I've always though.

24:22.822 --> 24:24.081
Is that you?

24:28.330 --> 24:30.384
I thought you were bigger.

24:31.506 --> 24:33.766
What you got there, Sergeant?

24:35.286 --> 24:37.464
My father has given me.

24:37.552 --> 24:41.200
Would not you should go to church?
- Yes, that's right.

24:41.893 --> 24:44.968
Mother is Catholic, Baptist's father.

24:45.069 --> 24:47.441
Ben while growing
far been to church.

24:47.535 --> 24:49.937
Why are you not a chaplain?

24:50.047 --> 24:53.163
One of those sacred kneusjes.

24:53.585 --> 24:57.893
I can also "holy" are
among the Gentiles.

24:58.823 --> 25:01.083
Will you sometimes repent?

25:02.961 --> 25:05.115
Let me know when you're ready.

25:05.401 --> 25:07.375
Well, grab your stuff.

25:07.483 --> 25:09.087
Come on, let's go further.

25:25.402 --> 25:27.875
Your mother waits in the car.

25:27.981 --> 25:30.805
I'm sorry.
I was the time it lost.

25:30.963 --> 25:35.495
It is best to wait,
because they sit on comfortable chairs.

25:36.613 --> 25:41.583
Dad, I think I know what I must do.
I feel it.

25:43.458 --> 25:47.609
But I... It is hard.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.906
If you feel the calling to serve,
you should follow it.

25:51.957 --> 25:55.131
You will be much more useful as a chaplain.

25:55.232 --> 25:59.214
But I feel that it is not enough.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.436
What do you mean?

26:08.782 --> 26:11.315
I enlisted in the paratroopers.
- No.

26:11.366 --> 26:13.535
I'm going to be commando.
- Really.

26:13.586 --> 26:15.668
It's already happened.
- No!

26:33.590 --> 26:37.955
Have you seen the 2nd Battalion?
- They are an hour ago that direction assumed.

26:49.461 --> 26:50.830
Warning.

26:54.643 --> 26:56.959
Go look.

27:41.124 --> 27:42.971
I grab him!

28:38.555 --> 28:41.043
Come on, who's got my Luger.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.318
Hey, take my picture again.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.243
Come on, quickly.

28:50.434 --> 28:53.200
I'm gonna send home to my mother.
Will her proud.

28:54.956 --> 28:57.671
You look like a big game hunter.

29:01.346 --> 29:02.810
What are you doing?

29:02.934 --> 29:06.086
Put ​​the camera down.
We go.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.600
What is it?

30:01.651 --> 30:03.951
Someone's watching us.

30:04.813 --> 30:07.975
At the dike, on the right flank.

30:09.603 --> 30:11.460
Are you sure?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.677
Yes. I'm sure.

30:22.741 --> 30:24.623
Do not shoot.

30:26.343 --> 30:28.213
Do not shoot.

30:29.319 --> 30:31.394
Are you alone?

30:31.751 --> 30:33.119
Yes.

30:33.969 --> 30:36.485
Step forward.
Slow.

30:52.742 --> 30:56.454
I'm Sergeant Jones.
- I'm Emilie Moreaux.

30:56.630 --> 30:59.427
Do you know French?
- My mother is French-Canadian.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.359
Do you speak English?
- A little bit.

31:02.441 --> 31:05.203
Can you bring us to Les Arcs.
There are more Americans.

31:05.304 --> 31:07.889
I can take you over there.
I am of the resistance.

31:07.890 --> 31:10.707
Resistance Friends are captured,
they keep them fixed, not far from here.

31:10.758 --> 31:13.567
I can bring you to Les Arcs
if you first help me to free them.

31:13.568 --> 31:15.707
Germans, how much?

31:16.219 --> 31:18.613
Five, maybe six.

31:18.783 --> 31:20.765
Can they help us or not?
What is she saying?

31:20.816 --> 31:24.762
Her name is Emilie. She says she
can help us but wants our help first.

31:24.813 --> 31:27.067
With what?
Help with what?

31:27.168 --> 31:30.027
She wants us
a group of her friends liberate resistance.

31:30.078 --> 31:32.440
The Germans keep them here not far from fixed.

31:32.714 --> 31:35.428
No.
You bring us to Les Arcs.

31:35.529 --> 31:38.050
And then we come back to help you,
but not before.

31:38.151 --> 31:43.391
We got many soldiers.
- Then it's too late, they're going to kill them.

31:43.422 --> 31:45.932
Please, I beg you.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.970
She says that it can not wait.
Then it may be too late.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.243
Dan let her just here.
We do not need her help.

31:53.294 --> 31:55.280
We can find it yourself Les Arcs.

31:55.902 --> 31:58.684
Please,
I need your help.

31:59.144 --> 32:00.800
Please.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.834
How do we know this is not a trap?
They can best collaborate with the Nazis...

32:05.885 --> 32:07.968
And lead us right into a trap.

32:12.186 --> 32:14.478
I think not.

32:22.842 --> 32:26.144
Agreed.
Take us there.

32:26.794 --> 32:28.734
Thank you.
Follow me.

32:29.174 --> 32:30.828
What did you tell her.

32:30.889 --> 32:36.423
I said that a few men a lot of problems
make, as they are on the right place.

32:36.895 --> 32:40.111
Of course, you did.
You are the Holy Jones.

32:40.212 --> 32:43.586
The patron saint of strangers in the woods.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.265
Forward.

32:56.755 --> 32:58.061
Wait.

33:11.729 --> 33:13.621
Can I?

33:13.969 --> 33:16.071
Is good.
- Thank you.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.099
There's a parachute.

33:21.997 --> 33:23.579
An American?

33:24.201 --> 33:26.047
Yes, it looks like this.

33:26.148 --> 33:28.499
We need to be sure.

33:47.111 --> 33:48.395
Lie!

33:55.581 --> 33:57.457
It's one of ours.

33:57.983 --> 34:02.011
Did he see us?
- Yeah, you know. He swings his wings.

34:02.392 --> 34:04.037
What the hell?

34:10.411 --> 34:13.665
To the other side of the field.
Move!

34:32.587 --> 34:34.353
Is he gone?

34:38.235 --> 34:40.637
Yes, I think he's gone.

35:01.097 --> 35:03.489
Curtis, help me to cover him.

35:14.621 --> 35:16.665
I'm speechless.

35:16.716 --> 35:19.702
I saw it in the pawn shop of Mr.
. Steven.

35:21.141 --> 35:22.449
Thank you.

35:23.501 --> 35:27.051
You want our last day together
not wasting me to kiss.

35:33.616 --> 35:36.725
You need me every week to send a picture.

35:36.776 --> 35:39.495
So I can see what you see.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.992
What would I do without you.

35:45.255 --> 35:47.217
This is easy.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.669
First, close your eyes.

35:50.113 --> 35:51.967
Close your eyes.

35:55.856 --> 35:58.503
Remember me that you hold.

35:59.785 --> 36:02.419
And then you breathe.

36:14.467 --> 36:16.704
What if I do not return.

36:17.213 --> 36:19.327
I come get you.

36:31.217 --> 36:33.278
What is the purpose?

36:34.085 --> 36:36.354
Nothing has changed.
- Think.

36:36.455 --> 36:39.162
She has brought us further away
and we know nothing about her.

36:39.203 --> 36:42.048
You know nothing about her.
- Put us a try?

36:42.099 --> 36:45.930
Her father was a doctor. Moisture in the first
war, would then no longer touch weapon.

36:45.981 --> 36:49.694
The Germans invaded, they joined the Resistance
. He did not think they did.

36:49.729 --> 36:53.028
Three weeks ago the Gestapo
learned about her, seized her father and brother.

36:53.129 --> 36:55.064
And they tortured and executed.

36:55.165 --> 36:58.156
She's got more than you invested.

37:16.407 --> 37:18.610
What is your real name?

37:19.790 --> 37:23.135
I know you understand me,
more than let you know.

37:23.580 --> 37:25.564
Why do you ask?

37:31.708 --> 37:34.075
Because I want to trust.

37:34.812 --> 37:36.632
Trust me.

38:27.021 --> 38:30.119
We will soon be doing, or
it is not our work.

38:30.865 --> 38:34.555
Rossi, I'll take these two.
You go around along the East.

38:34.656 --> 38:37.603
Fri
Make the back and we see each other again at the front.

38:43.605 --> 38:47.063
You and Emilie remain here and give me coverage.

38:47.783 --> 38:51.167
Stay here with Curtis and
keep the Germans in the eye.

39:09.425 --> 39:13.208
I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

39:13.410 --> 39:16.506
I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

39:16.637 --> 39:20.444
I give this to me as a volunteer,
I've known the dangers all too well.

39:23.209 --> 39:24.642
Sorry.

39:35.915 --> 39:39.849
It is my honor and oath
prestige to uphold...

39:39.950 --> 39:43.102
In everything I am and do.

39:43.137 --> 39:46.725
I serve a mighty force
famous for...

39:47.135 --> 39:49.949
Sorry, I'm ready.

39:53.113 --> 39:54.879
Hands up!
- No, do not shoot.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.217
Do not shoot!

40:05.076 --> 40:06.621
Warning.

40:22.973 --> 40:24.282
Safe.

40:25.603 --> 40:29.371
All is well.
Those soldiers are there to help us.

40:29.991 --> 40:33.473
That was good cover fire.
- She can shoot pretty.

40:33.875 --> 40:37.159
Where is Gustave?
- They took him in for interrogation.

40:38.205 --> 40:41.131
We got him all night
screaming.

40:41.637 --> 40:44.739
There is still a prisoner.
Look after the other building.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.557
Mr. Lieb, Mr.. Jacques.

40:50.071 --> 40:52.323
Thank you.
- Anytime.

40:52.511 --> 40:54.480
Hello.
- Jacques.

42:18.296 --> 42:19.767
Open the door!

42:20.255 --> 42:21.821
The door is locked.

42:21.965 --> 42:23.717
Let me inside.

42:25.185 --> 42:27.899
Rossi, come on.
Open!

42:45.697 --> 42:47.707
He's dead.

42:48.737 --> 42:50.119
He's dead.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.937
Let's get you cleaned up.

43:03.125 --> 43:07.101
But you special talents and a calling.
You're a preacher.

43:07.202 --> 43:10.884
God does not want you die
in some foxhole.

43:11.015 --> 43:13.679
He does not want anyone
in a foxhole dies, Dad.

43:13.720 --> 43:18.647
But your calling is special.
You have to find another way to serve.

43:18.712 --> 43:22.803
A safer way.
- Exactly, you have not thought about it.

43:26.413 --> 43:29.011
I've thought about it,
I've done nothing...

43:29.112 --> 43:31.167
Then think about this.

43:31.751 --> 43:35.321
It is good to support and provide guidance...

43:35.453 --> 43:37.947
If I can do that, I will do that.

43:38.071 --> 43:42.658
I know I should be,
I can do the most good.

43:46.031 --> 43:47.319
Yes.

43:51.331 --> 43:54.869
I have you learned your own choices.

43:56.670 --> 43:59.291
This changes everything.

43:59.888 --> 44:02.707
I'll wait in the car with your mother.

44:15.561 --> 44:18.077
Thank you.
- We must bring them to Les Arcs.

44:18.178 --> 44:20.357
This is the least we can do.

44:20.989 --> 44:25.217
We are here, right?
- No, actually we're here.

44:26.301 --> 44:31.551
In order to Les Arcs, we must take this road
, but that is full of German patrols.

44:31.561 --> 44:35.894
What do we do?
- Here is a path through the hills.

44:35.953 --> 44:38.593
This is used by shepherds.

44:41.157 --> 44:46.021
This is a detour.
At least five kilometers.

44:46.115 --> 44:50.362
But much safer. We know that forests
good and the Germans never.

44:51.149 --> 44:56.059
It will take longer, but it is safer
?

44:56.205 --> 44:59.449
Is that it?
- Much safer, yes.

45:19.225 --> 45:21.407
Waiting.

45:23.561 --> 45:25.355
There's a vehicle.

45:30.736 --> 45:33.139
Stop!
Hands up.

45:34.865 --> 45:37.831
Soldiers of the 517de.
Good to see you.

45:40.603 --> 45:44.553
Sergeant Jones.
- Lt. Woodward, this is my driver, Stewart.

45:44.723 --> 45:47.362
Are the Allies already far
broken through in one night?

45:47.413 --> 45:50.307
Yes, certainly. We have the Krauts harshly.
Have you encountered resistance?

45:50.358 --> 45:54.443
Yes, a few.
We have a German postal disabled.

45:54.494 --> 45:55.879
Some partisans liberated.

45:55.920 --> 45:59.600
Then you will be pleased to hear that
10 km away, this way you sit battalion.

45:59.651 --> 46:01.518
That's good to know.

46:02.282 --> 46:06.868
I think we have a leak or something,
against something we will have driven.

46:07.952 --> 46:11.480
Yes, that's a ruptured fuel line.
That I might recover.

46:11.580 --> 46:13.628
Do you sometimes thirsty?

46:14.670 --> 46:20.288
So, Lieutenant, what are you doing here exactly?
- I care for the recovery of ammunition.

46:20.576 --> 46:24.064
It's just you and Stewart?
- For now.

46:24.115 --> 46:27.193
There is a war going on, people
no surplus.

46:30.567 --> 46:34.808
Have you heard of that officer
that his head was cut off?

46:34.908 --> 46:39.374
No, I do remember.
- Was in a small town in Italy.

46:39.474 --> 46:41.164
I can not remember its name
, but...

46:41.265 --> 46:44.436
Across the street had the Germans
a piano to use.

46:44.487 --> 46:46.903
It was guillotine  thread.
- Whatever.

46:47.004 --> 46:49.507
If you tell it you may call the guillotine wire.

46:49.558 --> 46:53.002
So which officer sits in his jeep with his
windshield folded down.

46:53.103 --> 46:55.809
He drives maybe a good 25 km / h.

46:55.910 --> 46:58.689
This thread grabs him right in his throat.

46:59.497 --> 47:02.563
It was his mouth.
- I heard it was his throat.

47:02.664 --> 47:04.479
His head came immediately.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.907
I have all of his teeth picked.

47:10.116 --> 47:12.146
It was his mouth.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.768
Well, that should be it.

47:21.006 --> 47:23.631
Thank you've helped me.
- No problem.

47:23.732 --> 47:27.538
Whence are you?
- Seattle, Washington.

47:28.906 --> 47:31.154
There it is wet and rainy.

47:31.310 --> 47:37.486
Many totem poles.
- Sometimes I feel small on the totem pole.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.144
The lonely man.

47:39.622 --> 47:40.996
Excuse?

47:41.362 --> 47:43.756
Do not you mean the lone man on the totem pole
?

47:44.090 --> 47:46.680
Yeah, right.
Lonely man.

47:47.134 --> 47:49.155
And you then?

47:49.320 --> 47:52.030
Whence are you?
- Albuquerque, New Mexico.

47:52.131 --> 47:55.499
Torrance, California, born and raised.
- Good.

47:55.550 --> 48:00.275
Since I've never been.
Have never been outside the Northwest.

48:02.212 --> 48:05.033
Have you fought?
- We are no opposition encountered.

48:05.134 --> 48:07.573
Have been a few times been fired,
but it's pretty quiet.

48:07.674 --> 48:10.550
Besides, if we are attacked,
we burn the paper and...

48:10.601 --> 48:13.818
We have no lists or inventories.
- Can I see your gun here?

48:13.869 --> 48:16.218
Excuse?
- May I?

48:16.851 --> 48:20.732
I'm sorry, I do not understand what she says.
- She wants the gun.

48:30.030 --> 48:31.374
Beautiful.

48:32.892 --> 48:35.768
Can I shoot it?
- Did you hear that, Rossi?

48:35.869 --> 48:37.952
She thinks you're beautiful rifle.

48:38.018 --> 48:40.472
She can fold
fixed and stabbing into her handbag.

48:41.429 --> 48:45.302
I know we normally have to be frugal with our
ammunition, but she wants it fires.

48:45.353 --> 48:48.218
Do you mind?
- I have no problem with that.

48:48.269 --> 48:51.644
The Germans are long gone.
- Yeah, try it.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.184
You need to convert the safety.

49:14.867 --> 49:16.593
Can he shoot well?

49:19.132 --> 49:22.328
He ​​is not as good as he thinks he is.

49:22.429 --> 49:25.408
I heard you my name,
which you had it?

49:25.495 --> 49:29.581
I'm sure I can shoot better.
You want to bet?

49:30.110 --> 49:32.974
What is she saying?
- She says she wants a shooting.

49:33.075 --> 49:35.530
She thinks she's better than you.
- I really want to see.

49:35.631 --> 49:38.184
No, we're not...

49:38.285 --> 49:40.088
She wants to bet.

49:42.712 --> 49:45.601
Okay.
I take her money.

49:45.725 --> 49:51.080
He says he does not like
money will decrease.

49:52.014 --> 49:56.129
He's too cocky.
Why are we betting?

49:56.184 --> 49:58.841
What you got, Rossi?

50:05.671 --> 50:08.492
This is good. Yes.
- She does not mind.

50:08.549 --> 50:10.377
What do you want?

50:10.899 --> 50:13.909
I said I do want her money, but...

50:14.065 --> 50:16.319
A kiss for me as well.

50:16.859 --> 50:18.073
A kiss?

50:18.104 --> 50:23.018
Yes, a kiss just as
French women can give.

50:25.398 --> 50:27.151
Agreement.

50:28.309 --> 50:31.714
Looks like we have a deal.
- This is going to be awesome.

50:49.908 --> 50:54.200
Is this the fair sometimes?
- It is 1000 meters, about anyway.

50:54.580 --> 50:57.934
That's not fair, she can never touch.
I can maybe not.

50:57.985 --> 51:00.256
That's the idea.

51:01.410 --> 51:03.870
I'm a fool but you just set.

51:04.532 --> 51:08.528
You must first let the lady go.
- Yes, but do your best.

51:08.629 --> 51:13.317
No, I prefer the second.
- She wants you to show how to do it.

51:16.245 --> 51:18.079
What the lady like.

51:18.180 --> 51:21.881
Well, three shots. Nothing more.
Three bullets, that's good?

51:21.982 --> 51:23.275
Yes, that's good.

51:33.531 --> 51:35.663
Do you want to...

52:04.047 --> 52:05.289
Thank you.

52:05.754 --> 52:07.283
Handsome shot.

52:09.368 --> 52:11.535
It is pretty nice shoot.

52:13.829 --> 52:16.435
Standing  she never hit.

52:20.855 --> 52:26.013
She does it standing and put you fool.
That's what she'll do.

52:28.137 --> 52:30.659
Congratulations, that was impressive.

52:40.460 --> 52:41.715
Thank you.

52:46.772 --> 52:51.288
I admire your courage. Countries in
enemy territory without artillery support.

52:51.389 --> 52:54.941
No knowledge of the area.
I have a cousin who is in the Navy,

52:55.042 --> 52:58.425
for them is totally different. They
sleep every night in the same bed, hot food...

52:58.526 --> 53:01.615
Daily news of home movies.
I'm not saying it's easy...

53:01.666 --> 53:04.283
But it's not what you do.

53:05.401 --> 53:07.005
Movies?

53:07.207 --> 53:10.625
I can not remember when I've seen one.

53:11.365 --> 53:12.586
Yes, sir?

53:13.017 --> 53:15.961
When the last time you saw a movie?
Do you remember that?

53:16.012 --> 53:18.061
It's been a while ago.

53:18.112 --> 53:20.379
"Watch on the Rhine" with Paul Lukas.

53:21.605 --> 53:24.843
Lieutenant, I wanted to ask you...

53:25.027 --> 53:28.465
Where were you before you landed in Provence?
- We were in Italy.

53:28.505 --> 53:29.927
We.

53:30.176 --> 53:31.867
Where exactly?

53:32.991 --> 53:35.261
We landed in the south.

53:35.613 --> 53:38.823
In Suvito Vecchia?
- Sergeant, we need to go.

53:38.874 --> 53:40.955
You need to your battalion.
You may be entitled to...

53:41.006 --> 53:44.347
What are you landed?
- I do not have time for your questions.

53:44.485 --> 53:48.308
You need to get away, and that's an order.
- I ask you a simple question.

53:48.409 --> 53:50.751
What are you landed in Italy.

53:50.845 --> 53:52.717
Are you crazy?

53:53.193 --> 53:56.511
They are Germans.
Take their weapons, search them.

53:58.325 --> 54:01.439
You're going to tell us exactly who you are.

54:03.403 --> 54:07.364
I hate nothing worse than
sneaky nasty Nazis.

54:24.291 --> 54:25.783
Seat.

54:30.249 --> 54:32.047
Frisk them again.

54:32.072 --> 54:33.763
Look after his pockets.

54:33.836 --> 54:35.343
Nothing forgotten.

54:49.001 --> 54:50.545
They have nothing.

54:52.003 --> 54:54.399
Who is Francois Poulenc?

54:54.518 --> 54:57.603
I have to just give my name and rank.

54:58.043 --> 54:59.903
Who is Francois Poulenc?

55:01.176 --> 55:04.322
Schneider, Klaus.
Soldier.

55:04.491 --> 55:07.457
Why are you here?
What is your mission?

55:07.508 --> 55:11.323
Material destroy officers
murder, inquire, what?

55:12.201 --> 55:13.809
Talk!

55:13.883 --> 55:16.577
I need to know what your association with this man!

55:16.622 --> 55:19.913
I'm not mad, Sergeant.
I know how it goes in your country.

55:19.969 --> 55:22.333
Americans injure no prisoners.

55:24.183 --> 55:27.963
You tell me right now
or I swear I blow your head off.

55:28.589 --> 55:30.771
That you did not do.

55:34.349 --> 55:35.593
Now...

55:35.770 --> 55:39.012
All bluff.
That's all this is.

55:53.147 --> 55:55.260
Like I said.

55:55.361 --> 55:57.001
I know Americans.

56:10.109 --> 56:14.165
This fine French people,
who are not like Germans made.

56:14.266 --> 56:18.060
I need to know who Francois Poulenc and
why you see his name on paper with you.

56:18.161 --> 56:19.493
And it immediately.

56:19.676 --> 56:22.588
Poulenc was one of our best informants
in Provence.

56:22.639 --> 56:26.821
And you would 'm going to meet.
- In Le Tournay, in his apartment.

56:26.934 --> 56:29.790
And then?
- We had to relieve him...

56:29.841 --> 56:33.571
Fear that the Allies
him with important data would intervene.

56:33.587 --> 56:38.063
I would not worry.
The resistance will be to him care.

56:47.262 --> 56:50.213
Jacques will bring the prisoner and return with reinforcements.

56:50.342 --> 56:52.049
Where does he go?

56:52.140 --> 56:55.736
For his final journey.
- I do not care.

56:55.837 --> 56:59.324
All I know is that
he returns with reinforcements.

56:59.414 --> 57:02.404
Emilie and I will bring you to Les Arcs.
- Good.

57:09.127 --> 57:11.574
He knew that the Germans were you?

57:12.191 --> 57:15.507
A U.S. soldier with a German binoculars?

57:15.568 --> 57:18.910
Did you know that buyer that wearing?
We do not on the battlefield.

57:19.011 --> 57:23.295
Yes, officer back.
Patton drove even always easy front.

57:23.396 --> 57:25.376
That was close.

58:14.449 --> 58:16.742
This is the way to Les Arcs.

58:16.843 --> 58:18.141
Good.

58:21.964 --> 58:23.956
Do not shoot, it's Jacques.

58:29.755 --> 58:32.418
And? Everything went well?

58:33.475 --> 58:36.122
Kill these guys Germans?

58:37.114 --> 58:38.987
Yes, I suppose so.

58:39.071 --> 58:41.019
And they eat them.

58:42.401 --> 58:45.754
How did you find us.
- You have left traces everywhere.

58:45.937 --> 58:49.524
Is everybody ready?
Good. Then we go.

59:01.091 --> 59:03.925
We have a tank and a halftrack.

59:04.947 --> 59:09.843
Maybe 12-15 infantry.
- Are we, or do we wait?

59:12.395 --> 59:15.528
No, we have a task to accomplish.

59:15.629 --> 59:18.415
A few men and a lot of problems.

59:20.518 --> 59:22.954
We need that tank off.

59:23.782 --> 59:25.945
That will not be easy.

59:26.418 --> 59:30.483
We must destroy that tank.
Can we count on you?

59:30.584 --> 59:34.129
This is our country.
Course we help you.

59:34.771 --> 59:38.852
Stay here on this ridge.
Then can you halftrack flank.

59:38.858 --> 59:41.906
I want you out firing rifle grenades.
- Understood.

59:41.957 --> 59:47.524
I, Rossi, Philippe, we go to the
riverbed. Wait until they pass.

59:47.625 --> 59:50.969
And then we accompany them on their left.
Clear?

59:51.092 --> 59:53.775
Then we have that tank off.

59:54.035 --> 59:57.560
What we have for that tank?
- A surprise.

59:57.661 --> 01:00:00.512
A magnetic charge.
This is perfect.

01:00:00.715 --> 01:00:03.117
You, come with us.

01:00:03.218 --> 01:00:04.553
Jacques.

01:00:08.562 --> 01:00:09.797
Take it.

01:00:10.022 --> 01:00:11.829
For luck.

01:00:11.968 --> 01:00:13.571
Thank you.

01:01:08.022 --> 01:01:11.088
Wait until they disappear.
Not before.

01:01:34.638 --> 01:01:37.854
Everybody out.

01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.892
Fast.
- In coverage.

01:02:31.975 --> 01:02:33.741
Go left!

01:02:48.163 --> 01:02:50.367
I need that tank to get you.

01:02:57.987 --> 01:02:59.799
Lie!

01:03:36.362 --> 01:03:38.684
Warning.
In coverage remain.

01:04:42.814 --> 01:04:44.310
Do you...

01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:46.964
I do not recommend for a medal.

01:04:48.156 --> 01:04:50.396
You have a medic needed.
Medic!

01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:53.267
Is okay.

01:04:53.368 --> 01:04:55.276
You're a bad liar.

01:04:56.606 --> 01:04:58.673
Is okay.

01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:02.644
Grenade!

01:05:10.196 --> 01:05:12.789
Do not go.
I'll get you out of here.

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:14.378
I'll get you out of here.

01:05:18.836 --> 01:05:24.289
I do not recommend for a medal.
- Do not go. I'm getting you out of here.

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:32.625
Dad, I think I know what I must do.
I feel it.

01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:37.121
If you feel the calling to serve,
you should follow it.

01:05:39.632 --> 01:05:42.504
I enlisted in the paratroopers.

01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:46.359
God does not want you die
in some foxhole.

01:05:51.511 --> 01:05:56.054
I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

01:05:56.254 --> 01:05:59.482
I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

01:05:59.941 --> 01:06:03.362
I give this to me as a volunteer...

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:10.885
I'll have to come get you.

01:06:12.046 --> 01:06:14.194
I'm sorry.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.085
Close your eyes.

01:06:19.374 --> 01:06:21.560
Close your eyes.

01:06:21.991 --> 01:06:23.800
Close your eyes.

01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:28.836
Close your eyes.

01:06:35.443 --> 01:06:38.082
Remember me that you hold.

01:06:41.902 --> 01:06:44.399
Remember me that you hold.

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:49.681
And then you breathe.

01:06:53.107 --> 01:06:55.631
And then you breathe.

01:12:00.381 --> 01:12:04.010
I've wound as best connected.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.368
But I had no relationship.

01:12:12.187 --> 01:12:14.333
How do you feel?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.223
It tastes good.

01:12:48.752 --> 01:12:51.059
Please, take some.

01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:07.034
You need to eat.

01:13:07.037 --> 01:13:09.630
You should be healthy again.

01:13:20.412 --> 01:13:21.690
Eat.

01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:26.722
Food.

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.438
Eat.

01:13:39.405 --> 01:13:42.880
Usually, it's terrible.

01:13:43.197 --> 01:13:46.322
But if you have not eaten for days...

01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:49.559
Then it's not so bad.

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:03.228
My name is Erich Neuman.

01:14:06.523 --> 01:14:07.835
Erich.

01:14:09.999 --> 01:14:11.446
And you?

01:14:14.396 --> 01:14:16.173
What is your name?

01:14:20.491 --> 01:14:22.488
Your name?

01:14:33.447 --> 01:14:35.632
Are you an officer?

01:14:35.682 --> 01:14:37.573
Excuse?

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:40.311
I do not know what you mean.

01:14:41.245 --> 01:14:44.721
Your stripes.
Officer?

01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:48.091
Officer, yes.

01:15:08.727 --> 01:15:10.885
This is my brother.

01:15:13.018 --> 01:15:15.657
He has learned English.

01:15:16.665 --> 01:15:18.457
He's interpreter.

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:23.980
A translator.

01:15:27.536 --> 01:15:30.956
He tried to persuade me
to learn English.

01:15:33.138 --> 01:15:35.443
This is your brother?

01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:37.738
Yes.

01:15:37.893 --> 01:15:41.429
Can he English?
- Yes.

01:15:46.394 --> 01:15:48.398
Where is he?

01:15:52.679 --> 01:15:54.049
Where?

01:15:57.504 --> 01:15:59.714
He's...

01:15:59.815 --> 01:16:02.393
He was killed in Italy.

01:16:03.114 --> 01:16:04.711
Italy?

01:16:07.244 --> 01:16:10.050
Then he lucky.

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.382
I've been to Italy.

01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:18.914
Is he still there?

01:16:19.093 --> 01:16:22.004
He's dead.

01:16:23.924 --> 01:16:25.226
What?

01:16:30.842 --> 01:16:32.478
Death.

01:16:39.914 --> 01:16:42.442
I had a friend...

01:16:44.245 --> 01:16:46.678
Together with me in Italy.

01:16:49.117 --> 01:16:52.014
He was my best friend.

01:16:58.006 --> 01:17:01.175
I do not even know why I'm talking to you.

01:17:02.196 --> 01:17:05.011
I do not know if you understand me.

01:17:09.004 --> 01:17:12.653
I promised his mother...

01:17:13.646 --> 01:17:16.331
I would keep him safe.

01:17:30.911 --> 01:17:33.760
Do you have a family?

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:38.565
Yes.
- Yes, kids?

01:17:38.646 --> 01:17:41.741
I have a son.

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:44.652
Do you have a picture of him?

01:18:01.314 --> 01:18:04.137
Is this your son?

01:18:08.835 --> 01:18:11.419
He's wearing your uniform.

01:18:22.535 --> 01:18:24.964
I hate that uniform.

01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:35.655
And I'm supposed to hate you too.

01:18:39.837 --> 01:18:42.760
I'm supposed to want to kill you.

01:18:52.118 --> 01:18:55.553
Do you miss your brother?

01:19:00.398 --> 01:19:03.172
And would you not kill me?

01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:16.225
I...

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:18.271
'm...

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.511
Tired.

01:19:27.193 --> 01:19:29.279
I'm too tired.

01:19:41.014 --> 01:19:42.405
Sorry.

01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:30.203
High from heaven.
On rocks and hills...

01:21:31.443 --> 01:21:34.199
Sees both of us...

01:21:34.736 --> 01:21:37.593
And keeps us safe.

01:21:44.523 --> 01:21:46.142
Elsa!

01:21:49.673 --> 01:21:51.141
Uli.

01:21:57.506 --> 01:22:01.026
You make me think of my son.

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:32.485
Someone's coming.
Wake up.

01:22:47.089 --> 01:22:49.187
Wake up.

01:22:50.672 --> 01:22:52.378
Wake up.

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:55.495
Democracy - Lafayette.

01:22:55.546 --> 01:22:57.327
I'm coming.

01:23:00.874 --> 01:23:03.637
He's wounded. We are only two of us.

01:23:03.688 --> 01:23:06.046
Captain, everything is safe.

01:23:17.142 --> 01:23:19.119
That's been there.

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.207
Corporal...

01:23:21.305 --> 01:23:23.897
Have you shot him.

01:23:24.682 --> 01:23:26.855
No, I did not.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:33.229
We have a wounded soldier.
Remove the medic.

01:23:46.674 --> 01:23:50.312
Captain, he's my prisoner.

01:23:50.528 --> 01:23:53.480
So I find that I toehoort.

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.132
Also good.

01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:00.220
This is a beautiful Luger.

01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:08.305
I want you to inform the emergency room.
Let them know we're coming with injuries.

01:25:09.555 --> 01:25:12.312
How did you do with the progress report?
- It's almost done.

01:25:12.366 --> 01:25:13.573
Excuse me.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.821
Can you tell me whether Sergeant Caleb Jones
was brought here?

01:25:19.922 --> 01:25:21.449
Jones?

01:25:24.805 --> 01:25:29.925
Jones, wounded, transferred to a
first aid in Draguignan.

01:25:33.387 --> 01:25:36.456
And Harland Curtis?

01:25:36.557 --> 01:25:39.627
This is a corporal.
- Corporal Curtis...

01:25:42.029 --> 01:25:43.319
"K".

01:25:49.141 --> 01:25:51.162
I'll be back.

01:25:59.504 --> 01:26:01.704
You have nothing.

01:26:02.117 --> 01:26:04.248
Is there anyone else with you?

01:26:05.454 --> 01:26:06.879
No.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.705
But they have destroyed the tank.

01:26:11.894 --> 01:26:14.509
I thought you'd want.

01:26:15.667 --> 01:26:18.277
Is this Curtis?

01:26:19.577 --> 01:26:22.150
Thanks, Emilie.

01:26:22.953 --> 01:26:25.297
Emilie's not my real name.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:28.994
Yes, I know.

01:26:31.614 --> 01:26:33.852
Do you have a real name?

01:26:44.012 --> 01:26:48.966
I'm sorry. Can you wait outside,
I need him further care.

01:27:15.581 --> 01:27:18.215
I'm sorry about your family.

01:27:18.941 --> 01:27:21.515
I'm sorry about your friends.

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.437
Can it?

01:28:41.826 --> 01:28:49.092
In memory of Harland "Bud" Curtis
and the brave men of the 517de PRCT.
