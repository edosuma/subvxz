00:58.591 --> 01:00.459
<i>Heaven or hell?</i>

01:00.461 --> 01:04.263
<i>People don't find out where
they're headed until they die.</i>

01:04.265 --> 01:08.434
<i>But I know. I know
where everyone's going.</i>

01:08.436 --> 01:10.769
<i>Because I'm the one
who makes the decision.</i>

01:13.441 --> 01:16.975
<i>This was the moment
my life changed forever.</i>

01:16.977 --> 01:19.545
<i>Because God starting
speaking to me.</i>

01:35.662 --> 01:37.429
<i>He gave me a job.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:40.165
<i>My purpose in life.</i>

01:40.167 --> 01:42.367
<i>The judgements.</i>

01:45.773 --> 01:47.306
<i>He told me as long as
I trusted my instincts</i>

01:47.308 --> 01:50.676
<i>and did my job...</i>

01:50.678 --> 01:51.878
<i>everything would be alright.</i>

03:02.115 --> 03:05.117
<i>My name is
Walter Gary Benjamin.</i>

03:05.119 --> 03:08.253
<i>My friends call me Wally.</i>

03:08.255 --> 03:10.088
<i>My enemies call me
"kid" or "dumbass"</i>

03:10.090 --> 03:13.258
<i>or sometimes "stupid fuck."</i>

03:13.260 --> 03:15.160
<i>My mom has always
gone with Walt,</i>

03:15.162 --> 03:18.297
<i>and my dad, whenever I talk
to him, goes with Walter.</i>

03:18.299 --> 03:21.900
<i>He's God, by the way.
My dad.</i>

03:21.902 --> 03:24.603
<i>And no, I'm not Jesus,
that was someone else.</i>

03:24.605 --> 03:25.971
<i>With a beard.</i>

03:40.287 --> 03:41.720
Eggs?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.222
I have to go to work.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.257
It's an important part of life,
you know, eating.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.025
I'm sorry, but being late
is not an option.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.493
You're never late.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.163
Because I always leave
at the same time. Goodbye.

03:51.165 --> 03:53.532
Well, what if you starve
to death on the way to work?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.701
I won't.
You might!

03:55.703 --> 03:56.703
I won't.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.036
Your bus could crash.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.173
Everybody dies on impact,
except you.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.841
But the paramedics
can't get to you,

04:02.843 --> 04:03.875
because you're trapped,

04:03.877 --> 04:05.611
under all the twisted metal,

04:05.613 --> 04:07.012
and the other dead passengers,

04:07.014 --> 04:09.047
and then there's gas,
all over the road!

04:09.049 --> 04:11.416
Now it doesn't explode,
which is a good thing.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.018
But while they're
busy making

04:13.020 --> 04:15.020
all of their explosion
preparations,

04:15.022 --> 04:18.123
who dies of starvation?

04:18.125 --> 04:20.459
You do!

04:56.096 --> 04:58.196
<i>Being who I am
isn't always easy.</i>

04:58.198 --> 04:59.865
<i>The job of deciding
someone's eternal fate</i>

04:59.867 --> 05:02.167
<i>is a great responsibility.</i>

05:22.089 --> 05:25.724
<i>Him, hell.
Her, heaven.</i>

05:25.726 --> 05:26.992
<i>Heaven.</i>

05:26.994 --> 05:31.797
<i>Heaven, hell.
Heaven.</i>

05:31.799 --> 05:33.031
<i>Heaven.</i>

05:33.033 --> 05:34.533
<i>When making a judgement,</i>

05:34.535 --> 05:36.575
<i>I'm required to look
past the obvious.</i>

05:43.444 --> 05:48.246
<i>Heaven. Heaven. Heaven.</i>

05:59.826 --> 06:03.528
<i>Most of the time, I'm able to
do my job without question.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.931
<i>But it's hard for me on
this particular city bus.</i>

06:08.334 --> 06:10.902
<i>When I was eleven, I took this
same bus to the hospital</i>

06:10.904 --> 06:14.706
<i>with Jim a lot.</i>

06:14.708 --> 06:16.375
<i>He told me if he could
fight fires for a living,</i>

06:16.377 --> 06:17.909
<i>a little disease was
nothing to worry about.</i>

06:17.911 --> 06:19.311
Then everything's
gonna be okay?

06:19.313 --> 06:21.346
Then everything's gonna be okay.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.803
Dad, when I grow up,
I'm gonna be...

06:58.485 --> 07:01.353
Look at this kid,
all eager and shit.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.588
I take the time out of
my day to address

07:03.590 --> 07:04.823
your quirky little dumbass self,

07:04.825 --> 07:05.957
and you're just
gonna blow me off?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.259
I'm working, Vince.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.894
No, you're vacuuming.
I'm working.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.329
Constantly. See, I got this call
back on this jack-in-the-box

07:11.331 --> 07:12.764
spot they're shooting
up in Chi-town.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.499
Corey gave each of us a list
of pre-matinee duties

07:14.501 --> 07:16.268
that we're supposed to...
Corey gave up on life

07:16.270 --> 07:18.036
when he gained 40 pounds,
opted against using Rogaine

07:18.038 --> 07:20.005
and decided to manage
a fuckin' movie theatre

07:20.007 --> 07:21.473
was an acceptable
career choice.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.442
He's still our boss.
No, he's your boss.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.210
My boss is Brando.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.546
My boss is
motherfucking Denzel.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.414
My... my boss is that guy
who played Gandhi

07:29.416 --> 07:32.150
in that old-ass <i> Gandhi</i> movie.
Corey ain't shit.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.553
What was that?

07:34.555 --> 07:37.222
Ha! You know, I saw you
creeping up my perphery.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.557
You like what I was doing there?

07:38.559 --> 07:41.460
I was like, you know,
"Corey ain't shit!",

07:41.462 --> 07:43.695
knowing the whole time
you were coming right up on me.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.030
That's funny!

07:45.032 --> 07:47.532
Theatre 3 has puke
in one of the aisles,

07:47.534 --> 07:49.468
just for you, Vince.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.237
Yeah. Yeah, my boy,
he's all over that.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.239
Usually, when someone
identifies you by name,

07:54.241 --> 07:55.874
they're talking to you.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.396
Unless you've changed
your name to Douchebag.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.887
Lobby looks good.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.555
Thank you.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.524
The lobby floor is highest on
my list of pre-matinee duties,

08:12.526 --> 08:15.093
so I always make sure to...
Jesus Christ.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.486
- Undigested Milk Duds.
- Look at 'em.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.455
No thank you.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.023
Just fuckin' look at 'em!

08:45.025 --> 08:46.825
You're seein' general human
condition bullshit

08:46.827 --> 08:48.293
going on right in there, man!

08:48.295 --> 08:50.929
It's just a metaphor for life,
stupid fuck!

08:56.503 --> 08:58.803
<i>That's Kendall.</i>

08:58.805 --> 09:00.639
<i>Definitely heaven.</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:02.707
<i>I've liked her since the moment
she started working here,</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:04.976
<i>but she's Concessions.
I'm Tickets.</i>

09:04.978 --> 09:06.511
Yo, Kendall!

09:06.513 --> 09:08.673
<i>If only I can figure out
how to talk to her.</i>

09:13.319 --> 09:14.519
It's about time, Wally...

09:14.521 --> 09:16.354
<i>She says, cueing the music.</i>

09:18.425 --> 09:20.859
She says something
cool, poetic.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.427
Something cool,

09:22.429 --> 09:23.361
poetic.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.996
<i>I respond with equally profound</i>

09:24.998 --> 09:26.831
<i>yet effortless banter.</i>

09:26.833 --> 09:29.334
Words, words, words.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.081
I love you.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.449
You're staring.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.383
What?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.819
You're staring, dumbass.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.288
I wasn't staring.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.723
No, whatever you say,
Brokeback Rain Man.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.557
Vince!
What?

09:52.559 --> 09:54.259
Stop.
Hey, it's cool.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.194
I'm... I'm all secure
in my shit.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.129
Like, I don't want you to think
that I'm hatin' on

09:58.131 --> 09:59.664
the goofy bitch, I just...

09:59.666 --> 10:01.900
I'm totally into the ladies,
so I gotta be like,

10:01.902 --> 10:05.303
"Yo, you know, keep the homo
party on that side of the...

10:05.305 --> 10:07.305
"the lobby, 'cause
I only bang chicks."

10:07.307 --> 10:08.840
You know what I mean?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.542
Look, it's okay,
don't feel bad about yourself.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.410
I got an appeal.
It's an it-factor.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.612
I wasn't staring.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.013
Does this normally
work for you?

10:15.015 --> 10:17.515
What?
When you talk.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.754
Dramatic tension.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.491
Wow.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.860
I wasn't staring at Vince.

10:30.663 --> 10:34.032
Umm... I'm gonna go
set up before we open.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.034
Well, w... I wasn't staring.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.570
I wasn't.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.640
<i>- Even for the most dedicated
- Cineplex employee,</i>

10:41.642 --> 10:44.542
<i>there are extended
gaps of down-time.</i>

10:44.544 --> 10:46.878
<i>I spend mine watching movies.</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:48.980
<i>Comedy, romance, action,</i>

10:48.982 --> 10:53.318
<i>whatever it is Tyler Perry
thinks he's doing.</i>

10:53.320 --> 10:57.155
<i>As long as I can just watch.
No judging.</i>

11:12.806 --> 11:16.041
<i>Heaven. Heaven.</i>

11:16.043 --> 11:17.043
<i>What...</i>

11:27.186 --> 11:28.753
- Theatre 1 to your left.
- Heaven.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.795
Theatre 2. Heaven.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.068
Theatre 8 to your right. Hell.

12:13.599 --> 12:16.034
Hello?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.069
What do you want?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.423
Good day at work?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.291
Fine. It was fine.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.526
I made eggs.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.528
I'm... I'm not... I'm not...

12:43.530 --> 12:45.396
Are you sick?
No.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.432
Oh, Walt, you don't
look good.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.767
Did you catch something?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.235
I'm fine.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.736
I told you to get a flu shot.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.638
You're working at
that movie theatre,

12:53.640 --> 12:55.974
with all those people
with butter

12:55.976 --> 12:58.309
and bathroom doorknob
feces on their hands.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.345
I'll get the thermometer.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.760
<i>Heaven, heaven.</i>

14:57.162 --> 14:57.996
Listen, man, I don't
know what's wrong...

14:57.998 --> 14:59.264
<i>Hell.</i>

14:59.266 --> 15:00.706
But I need it today,
not tomorrow.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.574
Heaven. Heaven.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.709
Heav...

15:15.081 --> 15:16.614
Heaven.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.549
Heav...

15:18.551 --> 15:20.718
Hell. Heaven.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.434
Theatre 3 to your left. Heaven.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.809
Theatre 2 to your right.
Polo heaven, tank-top hell.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.911
Anybody say he'd be your
Prince Charming?

15:46.913 --> 15:49.647
Do you think or you just
completely...

15:49.649 --> 15:54.085
Uhh, Theatre 4 right...
uhh, to your right. Hell.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.557
Hello?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.759
Come on, man,
I'll miss my movie.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.395
Where are you going,
ticket guy?

16:04.397 --> 16:07.799
Just make the judgement, kid.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.367
This is not...
Yes or no,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.769
up or down, heaven or hell,
I really don't care,

16:11.771 --> 16:13.771
but I can't be here
any longer.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.174
You're not...
you're not even...

16:16.176 --> 16:18.910
I know who you are.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.445
This isn't...
This isn't...

16:20.447 --> 16:22.180
Do your job.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.781
- I can't get a reading...
- Can I get a new ticket guy?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.116
Mine's broken.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.852
Do... your... job.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.108
Must be nice.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.311
If I had a direct line like you,
I wouldn't have to do this.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.712
Do what? Who are you?

16:54.714 --> 16:55.913
I'm Greg.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.248
Greg?

16:57.250 --> 17:00.885
Yeah. Gregory Douglas Tomlinson,

17:00.887 --> 17:03.087
if that helps with
the paperwork.

17:03.089 --> 17:06.557
How do you...
Hmm? How do I what?

17:08.359 --> 17:10.161
Know who I am. No one knows.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.196
No one living, at least.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.165
Boo.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.968
It's a stupid joke.
It's... I just...

17:16.970 --> 17:20.171
I've been waiting a long time
to try that out, so...

17:20.173 --> 17:21.606
You're dead.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.141
My lack of colour
give me away?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.976
That's why I couldn't
get a read.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.310
So what's the plan?
How did you find me?

17:27.313 --> 17:29.080
I'm dead, Walter.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.448
I'm dead and I'm talking
to you.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.582
I judge the living.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.584
You judge everyone.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.118
Everyone living!

17:38.123 --> 17:40.491
So I'm...

17:40.493 --> 17:41.692
I'm stuck here like this?

17:41.694 --> 17:44.195
I don't know! I... I don't...

17:45.464 --> 17:47.298
Well, I can't!

17:53.405 --> 17:54.572
Living, dead,

17:54.574 --> 17:57.275
what's the difference?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.743
I told you, I can't
get a read...

17:58.745 --> 18:00.578
A read, a read,
right, whatever.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.580
Uhh, make a guess.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.315
I honestly don't care
where you send me,

18:04.317 --> 18:05.683
just get me outta here.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.685
Flip a goddamn coin!

18:14.726 --> 18:15.960
It doesn't work that way.

18:15.962 --> 18:16.761
Why not?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.162
Because I have to know.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.231
Who cares?

18:20.233 --> 18:22.300
He does.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.235
I have to be right,
that's how it works.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.536
And how does that happen

18:25.538 --> 18:28.673
with normal people
who aren't, you know, dead?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.608
I just see them and I know.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.110
You do all this
on a fuckin' hunch?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.945
I wouldn't expect you to
understand how I work.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.746
There's certain... mysteries
that can't be explained.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.415
Mysterious ways, right.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.884
Godspeak for bullshit.

18:44.390 --> 18:48.126
Can't feel anything.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.061
You have any idea
what that's like?

18:52.798 --> 18:53.931
I'm sorry, but I...

18:53.933 --> 18:55.166
I still can't help you.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.968
What's the harm
in trying, Walter?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.369
I have work to do,
and anything that keeps me

18:58.371 --> 19:00.638
from doing that work
is harmful, so please...

19:02.441 --> 19:05.176
Go away.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.187
Okay, I know I promised
not to talk about it...

19:16.189 --> 19:19.157
I'm fine.
You don't look fine.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.925
I told you we're
not talking about it.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.628
Well, you have kind of
a plague-y look.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.762
Plague-y?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.330
Well, a pre-plague-y look,

19:26.332 --> 19:28.132
but that's how it starts.
I don't have the plague.

19:28.134 --> 19:31.302
Ohh, The plague.
As if there's only one.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.970
Goodnight, Mom.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.406
Okay, okay, okay.
This time I promise:

19:35.408 --> 19:37.208
we will not talk about it.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.143
You won't keep that promise.
How do you know?

19:39.145 --> 19:41.078
Because you've broken it five
times since we started eating.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.147
Well, then tell me!
Tell you what?

19:43.149 --> 19:44.448
Whatever it is!

19:47.319 --> 19:48.586
You're gay.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.421
What?

19:50.423 --> 19:51.423
Aren't you?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.424
I'm not gay.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.624
It's okay if you are.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.092
But I'm not.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.196
Well, you're something.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.198
Something not gay!

20:01.467 --> 20:03.701
The book said you'd say that.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.436
And the book about
having a depressed son

20:05.438 --> 20:07.705
said I would deny being
depressed if confronted,

20:07.707 --> 20:10.074
and so did the one about
having an alcoholic son,

20:10.076 --> 20:13.444
and a cutter, and a
crystal meth addict, and...
Hey.

20:13.446 --> 20:17.148
I mean, it makes
the most sense.

20:17.150 --> 20:22.086
And I want you to know that
I am totally okay with it.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.889
Goodnight, Mom.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.062
Walt!

20:31.064 --> 20:34.065
I'm not sick, I'm not gay
and I'm not hungry.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.044
Whatever's going on with you,
you have to talk about it.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.047
If not with me,
then with somebody.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.750
There must be good
therapists out there.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.987
We can find one.

20:55.989 --> 20:57.788
Walt?

20:57.790 --> 20:58.790
Walt!

20:58.791 --> 21:00.191
I'm not dead, Mom.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.127
Just checking.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.844
Karen?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.179
Karen Benjamin?

21:55.181 --> 21:56.080
No.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.448
Oh, my Christ, is that you?

21:57.450 --> 22:00.518
I haven't seen you in so...
Honey, hug!

22:00.520 --> 22:03.688
Oh...
Oh, yeah, we're doin' it!

22:03.690 --> 22:05.823
How are you?
I'm great.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.325
I gotta tell you,

22:07.327 --> 22:10.628
that office was never
the same after you left, mmm-mm.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.996
Oh...
Really.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.497
What have you been doing?

22:13.499 --> 22:14.832
How's little Walter?

22:14.834 --> 22:16.200
Oh, I guess he's not
so little anymore.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.868
Gotta be in college
by now, right?

22:17.870 --> 22:20.705
Yeah, college and...
girlfriend.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.139
I mean, he's great.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.841
We're... we're... we're great.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.242
Oh, that's great!

22:26.478 --> 22:28.479
Umm...

22:28.481 --> 22:30.114
Wow!

22:30.116 --> 22:32.676
Oh, well, you know,
we ran out of eggs.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.545
Hey, Walter.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.480
You want some popcorn?

23:36.482 --> 23:38.048
I made it just for you.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.818
Special.
With extra butter...

23:40.820 --> 23:42.920
and bathroom doorknob feces.

23:45.324 --> 23:49.160
Let me know how many eggs
you want for breakfast, Walt.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.663
Wally?

23:52.665 --> 23:55.566
Walter!

23:55.568 --> 23:56.967
Walter.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.473
Walter...

24:03.809 --> 24:06.444
Don't be like that, Walter.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.645
Go away!

24:07.647 --> 24:09.847
That's all I'm trying
to do, buddy, go away.

24:09.849 --> 24:10.849
Forever.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.850
Leave me alone!

24:11.851 --> 24:12.983
Not a chance.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.385
Wanna snuggle?

24:16.288 --> 24:17.688
Stop!

24:19.124 --> 24:22.626
Stop! You have to stop!
You have...

24:27.899 --> 24:29.567
Are you gone?

24:33.071 --> 24:34.805
Is this destructive
ghost silence,

24:34.807 --> 24:36.740
or "gone forever because you've
realized I can't help you"

24:36.742 --> 24:37.875
silence?

24:41.047 --> 24:42.613
Walt?

24:43.950 --> 24:46.183
I'm... I'm fine!
Every... everything's fine.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.785
I can hear you
yelling in there.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.620
You can go away now,
'cause everything's okay,

24:49.622 --> 24:52.182
and I just need to start
getting ready now, so I...

24:55.327 --> 24:58.362
Umm... I have
your clothes ready.

24:58.364 --> 24:59.897
Thank you.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.699
I'll just...

25:04.769 --> 25:06.170
Everything's fine?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.707
Oh, I forgot the battery.
What?

25:09.709 --> 25:12.643
You asked me to get one
with a battery for a backup.

25:12.645 --> 25:16.313
Right. Batteries.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.781
It's important to be on time.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.854
Well, everything's fine.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.825
I need to get ready now.
I have a lot to do today, so...

25:27.827 --> 25:30.327
Okay.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.064
Does it help?

25:35.934 --> 25:37.201
What?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.470
If something's wrong with you,

25:39.472 --> 25:41.572
if something isn't
making sense...

25:43.375 --> 25:45.776
does it help to talk
to someone about it?

25:50.615 --> 25:52.249
Yes.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.656
I really need to start
getting ready now.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.959
As soon as I'm done
hugging you.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.863
Walter Benjamin.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.632
That's my name, yes.

26:43.635 --> 26:48.172
That is your name.
Walter Gary Benjamin.

26:48.174 --> 26:52.142
Ohh. You hiding bodies,
Walter Gary Benjamin?

26:53.478 --> 26:54.645
Bodies?

26:54.647 --> 26:56.447
You got a sort of serial killer
kind of name.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.715
Anyone ever tell you that?

26:57.717 --> 26:58.949
No.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.884
Of course not, that's
a terrible thing to say!

27:00.886 --> 27:03.153
So, what kind of crazy
are you?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.422
- I'm not crazy.
- Sure.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.257
But since you're here,
might as well pretend

27:07.259 --> 27:08.792
you're not completely
sane and normal

27:08.794 --> 27:10.894
so that I can pretend
to make you less crazy.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.763
You ever been in therapy before?

27:14.499 --> 27:15.699
No.

27:17.402 --> 27:20.404
Your mom said that
after your dad died,

27:20.406 --> 27:23.374
she took you to at least
ten different therapists.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.476
He wasn't my dad.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.644
Who?

27:26.646 --> 27:28.612
I didn't come here
to talk about him.

27:28.614 --> 27:30.347
Well, who'd you come
to talk about?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.816
Greg.
Greg.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.886
He's a ghost.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.821
Greg's a ghost.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.123
Yes.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.124
And that's who you came
to talk about?

27:40.126 --> 27:41.191
Greg, the ghost?

27:41.193 --> 27:43.093
Yeah.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.895
I'm not supposed to see ghosts.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.296
That was never...

27:48.500 --> 27:49.933
There's a plan.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.135
Of course there is.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.836
But I can't really
get into that.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.204
Greg needs to go.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.974
Okay? He's not supposed
to be here, so...

27:56.976 --> 28:00.177
there must be something
wrong with me, in my brain?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.979
If you know how to fix this,
I need you to do it

28:01.981 --> 28:04.081
as quickly as possible,
because it's starting to have

28:04.083 --> 28:06.316
a very negative effect
on my work.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.791
Could we go back
to Jim for a second?

28:13.793 --> 28:15.459
I'd rather not.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.328
Well, of course you wouldn't,
but I'm a doctor,

28:18.330 --> 28:19.897
this is my office,
and I'm bigger than you,

28:19.899 --> 28:21.465
so let's do it
my way for a second.

28:21.467 --> 28:25.402
Is Jim a ghost too?

28:26.838 --> 28:29.840
If I tell you, you have to
promise not to get angry.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.575
Why would I get angry?

28:33.278 --> 28:34.845
Because you're going to hell.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.719
Tell me something I don't know.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.722
You have the most beautiful
eyes, you should show those.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.657
You should really show those,
they're really nice.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.126
Thank you.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.328
Damn, they'd look really
good for cameras...

29:25.898 --> 29:28.999
That picks it up, and then
when you down the iris scope...

29:48.186 --> 29:50.521
She's beautiful.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.025
Yes, she is.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.261
Gonna talk to her?

29:57.263 --> 29:58.695
You don't exist
and I have work to do,

29:58.697 --> 30:00.164
so I'd rather not have
this conversation.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.632
Just say the word,
and I'm gone.

30:01.634 --> 30:02.866
Go!

30:02.868 --> 30:05.469
That's not the word
I'm lookin' for.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.838
Mine starts with an "H",
preferably two syllables,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.873
but I'll take what I can get.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.375
Go away!

30:11.377 --> 30:12.943
Talk to her, and I will.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.078
Really?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.780
Not forever, O Chosen One.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.549
You're not getting rid of me
'til you do your job.

30:18.551 --> 30:20.284
But I'll give you
the afternoon off.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.985
And all I have to do
is just... go... just...

30:21.987 --> 30:23.921
Talk to her like
a person would, yeah.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.089
But I don't think
you have the balls.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.958
I've got plenty of...

30:27.960 --> 30:29.359
balls.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.795
Prove it.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.781
Hi. What's going on?

30:50.783 --> 30:53.050
Uhh, maybe if there's
some free time after

30:53.052 --> 30:54.952
all the matinees start, I could
buy you some Junior Mints

30:54.954 --> 30:56.854
or something. But you wouldn't
have to eat them with me,

30:56.856 --> 30:59.923
they... they'd be a gift for you
to enjoy at your own leisure.

31:01.659 --> 31:05.696
Umm, actually... all of us back
here kinda just...

31:05.698 --> 31:08.398
borrow the candy that we want,
for free,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.868
so we don't have
to pay for it. Shh.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.469
I'm right here.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.471
It's fine, he doesn't care.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.672
See ya later.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.774
"Maybe after the
matinees start,

31:17.776 --> 31:19.943
"I could buy you some
Junior Mints or something?"

31:19.945 --> 31:22.379
That was fucking beautiful, bro.
Really, I mean it.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.681
I'm actually... I'm... I'm a
little hard right now,

31:24.683 --> 31:26.650
having just experienced
the joy of watching you do

31:26.652 --> 31:28.385
your thing, man!
That was great!

31:28.387 --> 31:30.287
My mom says that you're supposed
to treat women with respect,

31:30.289 --> 31:31.989
and talk to them about things
that they're interested in.

31:31.991 --> 31:32.956
And Kendall sells
Junior Mints...
Oh, God, hey,

31:32.958 --> 31:35.158
I know you're all in love with
her and shit, it's cool.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.695
I get it. But, I should
let you know that, umm,

31:38.697 --> 31:41.565
as your co-worker, and I like
to think as your friend, that...

31:41.567 --> 31:44.668
I'm probably gonna
nail that at some point.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.037
Like, really hard!
Oh yeah, she got a crazy side.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.805
Has some sort of breakdown
or something

31:48.807 --> 31:50.140
at that fancy-ass college

31:50.142 --> 31:52.409
she was going to.
Yeah, plus, I heard

31:52.411 --> 31:53.644
she ain't talked to her dad

31:53.646 --> 31:55.012
since she tried
to go pro as a cutter.

31:55.014 --> 31:59.016
You know what I mean?
Yeah. I kinda like that.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.984
Unstable bitches
are the shit, bro.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.987
You know, I don't want
to ruin, you know,

32:03.989 --> 32:05.856
what you and I have,
'cause I like to think that

32:05.858 --> 32:08.458
you and I have like
a <i> Of Mice and Men</i> thing.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.727
You know, I'm George.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.896
Or Lennie. Whichever one
isn't the fuckin' retard,

32:12.898 --> 32:14.798
and I don't wanna
ruin that, you know?

32:14.800 --> 32:17.968
So, for... for your sake,
and for our sake, really,

32:17.970 --> 32:20.771
just try not to picture her
riding my dick.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.940
Even though it's
totally gonna happen.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.141
Yo, Kendall!

32:27.345 --> 32:30.514
You pictured it. Ah, it's cool,
man. You're welcome.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.183
I didn't picture it!

32:39.224 --> 32:40.891
I didn't picture it.

32:40.893 --> 32:42.926
I do.

32:44.562 --> 32:48.332
<i>Most people seem really worried
about being alone.</i>

32:48.334 --> 32:50.801
<i>I guess I can understand
how someone can see life</i>

32:50.803 --> 32:53.203
<i>as random and meaningless.</i>

32:53.205 --> 32:54.938
<i>Even cruel, at times.</i>

32:56.240 --> 32:57.841
<i>So it makes sense
they'd spend most,</i>

32:57.843 --> 32:59.509
<i>if not all of their time,</i>

32:59.511 --> 33:01.378
<i>doing their best to ensure
they don't have to go</i>

33:01.380 --> 33:02.980
<i>through it by themselves.</i>

33:07.486 --> 33:09.753
<i>Safety in numbers, I suppose.</i>

33:53.164 --> 33:55.766
Not sure I understand the rules
of this particular game,

33:55.768 --> 33:58.735
but I'm pretty sure
we're both losing.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.670
So, how'd it go
with the girl?

34:00.672 --> 34:02.305
Fine.
You sure about that?

34:02.307 --> 34:03.707
Go away!
Make me.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.108
You know I can't do anything...

34:05.110 --> 34:06.543
We've got a big day
ahead of us, Walter.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.011
Figure we should
get going soon,

34:08.013 --> 34:10.147
so I can get you back
in time for work.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.313
Back?

34:11.315 --> 34:13.583
You do have, like,
adults' clothes, right?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.385
Back from where?
Huh? Field trip.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.786
What?

34:16.789 --> 34:19.056
A Son of God, I would think
a clothing allowance

34:19.058 --> 34:20.524
would be in order.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.525
Why are we... I'm not going
on a field trip with you.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.592
You're not even real!

34:23.594 --> 34:25.262
I have a therapist now.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.331
Ohh.
Yeah, you know, he's...
gonna fix this, so...

34:28.333 --> 34:30.333
I'm not going anywhere with you,
and even if I did,

34:30.335 --> 34:32.202
I'm not capable of sending you
to Heaven or Hell,

34:32.204 --> 34:33.703
so you're just gonna have
to get help with your problem

34:33.705 --> 34:34.971
from someone else.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.106
Okay?

34:36.108 --> 34:37.873
Huh? Sorry, didn't catch
most of that,

34:37.876 --> 34:40.911
I was too busy suffering from
the weight of ten years

34:40.913 --> 34:44.614
of unrealized post-death
eternity to hear you.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.216
Care to run all
that by me again?

34:47.717 --> 34:48.784
That's the best you got?

34:48.786 --> 34:50.754
I can't wear that.

34:53.658 --> 34:56.092
A church?

34:56.094 --> 34:59.096
Stop messin' with your suit,
you look fine.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.197
I do?

35:00.199 --> 35:01.731
No, but we're late.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.535
You never told me how.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.703
How what?

35:06.705 --> 35:08.605
You were able to find me.

35:10.641 --> 35:12.742
Mysterious ways, I guess.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.478
I still don't know
what we're doing here,

35:14.480 --> 35:16.279
and I haven't been inside a
church since Jim's funeral,

35:16.281 --> 35:17.547
and I just... I don't...

35:17.549 --> 35:18.782
the suit's really
uncomfortable!

35:18.784 --> 35:19.916
It's making my thighs
all sweaty,

35:19.918 --> 35:21.318
and I don't understand what...

35:23.321 --> 35:25.322
And then we'll go
through your vows.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.424
You've both written them
by now, yes?

35:27.426 --> 35:29.960
We'll have them done
by tomorrow, I promise.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.895
This is weird,
we shouldn't be here.
Not yet.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.931
"Wind Beneath My Wings",
a capella.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.400
Look, we should leave.

35:37.402 --> 35:38.902
Okay, alright,

35:38.904 --> 35:40.203
and then we'll have the
presentation of the rings.

35:40.205 --> 35:41.805
That's your cue.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.440
And, uhh...

35:43.442 --> 35:45.075
Mason.

35:45.077 --> 35:46.776
...don't chew gum throughout
the ceremony...

35:46.778 --> 35:49.412
Who's Mason?

35:49.414 --> 35:50.947
My son.

35:55.053 --> 35:58.722
Baby girl. Goddamn
beautiful baby girl.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.324
You have a family?

36:01.326 --> 36:03.894
Had. Had, yeah.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.262
Now, to her credit,

36:05.264 --> 36:08.064
it took her almost
a decade to re-marry.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.866
All this time,
you've just been...

36:09.868 --> 36:11.468
I don't stalk 'em
or anything.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.937
Anymore. I just keep tabs.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.739
Make sure everyone's okay.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.141
I mean, the new guy's
a little stiff.

36:18.143 --> 36:19.943
Pretty sure he's breathin'.

36:21.445 --> 36:22.946
So...

36:22.948 --> 36:24.748
So what?

36:24.750 --> 36:27.717
Where are they headed?

36:27.719 --> 36:29.252
You... you mean...

36:29.254 --> 36:31.521
I'm assuming that you
judge 'em one by one.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.325
You don't have, like,
an afterlife family plan

36:35.327 --> 36:36.459
or anything, right?

36:36.461 --> 36:37.794
Look, this isn't, really...

36:37.796 --> 36:39.329
So, they're gonna be okay?

36:39.331 --> 36:41.291
I...
I mean...

36:42.967 --> 36:44.367
She's not perfect.

36:46.470 --> 36:49.139
But for whatever it's worth,
she doesn't deserve Hell.

36:49.141 --> 36:50.607
And if you even think about
fucking over

36:50.609 --> 36:51.741
either one of my kids...

36:51.743 --> 36:54.377
I can't talk about it.
What?

36:54.379 --> 36:56.746
Other people's judgements
is not for anyone else to know.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.114
Come on.
I can't.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.383
That's my fuckin' family.
Not anymore!

37:00.385 --> 37:03.753
And you're off to start your
life as husband and wife,

37:03.755 --> 37:06.456
happily ever after.
Sound like a game plan?

37:06.458 --> 37:07.657
Thank you!

37:07.659 --> 37:09.226
I'm sorry.
No, that's good.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.994
That's good. It's... you know
you got your rules.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.996
Certainly convenient.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.054
Where are you going?

37:38.056 --> 37:39.656
I'm late for work!

38:01.245 --> 38:05.382
Nothing to worry about, kiddo.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.183
Just some more tests.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.619
Tests for what?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.488
Well... come here.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.823
They wanna know if
I'm really from Mars,

38:13.825 --> 38:16.393
or if I'm just weird.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.994
You should get tested too.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.898
You're weird. Are you weird
or just a Martian, Walter?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.302
<i>Jim Benjamin.</i>

38:25.304 --> 38:26.870
<i>Jim Benjamin.</i>

38:26.872 --> 38:28.505
Wish me luck.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.581
Okay, uhh, do you know
the number?

38:38.583 --> 38:42.118
Yeah.
I just need you to sign
for that, it's the top form.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.888
And then, uhh,
I'll be back in a bit.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.090
Alright. Sorry!

38:47.092 --> 38:49.192
Thank you.

39:19.291 --> 39:22.258
Oh, man, you're making this shit
too easy on me, Rain Man.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.127
Hey, by the way,
you're late, motherfucker.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.229
What?

39:26.231 --> 39:27.231
Wally!

39:27.232 --> 39:28.965
Wally.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.266
Hello, Kendall.

39:30.268 --> 39:34.671
How's your day going...
so far... today?

39:34.673 --> 39:36.406
Umm, it's... it's good.

39:36.408 --> 39:39.008
Yes, it's, uhh,
it's good so far.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.477
Good.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.446
Hey, tell me to just
shut up if I'm prying,

39:43.448 --> 39:45.515
or anything, but the
past couple days,

39:45.517 --> 39:47.784
you've seemed a little off,
or something.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.387
I'm fine, thank you.

39:52.189 --> 39:55.458
Cool suit you got there.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.593
It's too small.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.729
And very uncomfortable
in a variety of places,

39:59.731 --> 40:02.165
and it's making my thighs
continue to sweat even though

40:02.167 --> 40:05.001
I'm now in a very well
air-conditioned building.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.472
I feel weird now.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.408
No, Wally...
Goodbye.

40:12.777 --> 40:16.713
Well, well, well,
you are exactly...

40:17.916 --> 40:19.249
You're late.

40:19.251 --> 40:22.352
Which means you have to do
Vince's shit-work.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.053
But I'm the ticket-taker/
ticket-tearer.

40:24.055 --> 40:27.323
Sorry, Miho,
I don't make up the...

40:27.325 --> 40:29.526
What is... what are
you wearing?

40:29.528 --> 40:30.693
A suit.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.328
I didn't even know
you had other clothes.

40:32.330 --> 40:35.331
It's too small.
Yeah, a little bit.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.125
At least pretend to be
a little rattled.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.527
I'm a ghost, man!
You owe me that much.

41:04.529 --> 41:07.597
I'm working.
Yeah, apparently.

41:07.599 --> 41:08.965
You made me late.
So?

41:08.967 --> 41:09.999
I'm never late.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.402
Hey, I'm sorry, but...

41:12.404 --> 41:15.438
What's the Son of God doing
working at a movie theatre?

41:15.440 --> 41:17.807
Shouldn't you be, like,
curing lepers or something?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.943
Miracles were phased out
over a thousand years ago.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.078
I'm pretty sure lepers don't
go to the movies very often.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.347
Never answered my question.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.749
The lobby offers constant access
to new people for judgment.

41:26.751 --> 41:27.750
Just makes sense to work here.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.152
Bullshit!

41:29.154 --> 41:31.120
There'd be like three times
as many people

41:31.122 --> 41:34.290
at McDonalds or the
fuckin' DMV. Why here?

41:34.292 --> 41:35.792
He used to take me here a lot.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.160
Who?
Jim.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.828
Who's Jim?
Even after he got sick.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.897
"A nice escape from reality,"
he called it.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.432
Walter...
So now I work here.

41:42.434 --> 41:44.501
But instead of doing
my cineplex duties,

41:44.503 --> 41:45.969
I'm the trash collector/
trash emptier,

41:45.971 --> 41:47.237
which is the punishment
for being late,

41:47.239 --> 41:48.439
which I only am
because of you,

41:48.440 --> 41:49.839
which... which I don't
even think

41:49.841 --> 41:52.281
you've properly acknowledged.
You miss him?

41:55.246 --> 41:57.180
- They don't miss me.
- I mean, you know.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.948
I have to go back to work.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.783
You know her, don't ya?

42:00.785 --> 42:03.019
Who?
Allie.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.754
The way you looked at her,
at the church.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.222
I need to get back inside...
How do you know her?

42:06.224 --> 42:07.957
Just please leave me alone.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.493
I'm not gonna watch her walk
down that aisle, Walter.

42:10.495 --> 42:13.329
It has to be now!
Do your job!

42:33.918 --> 42:35.218
No!

42:35.220 --> 42:37.220
Church? Really?

42:37.222 --> 42:38.688
I know we talked about this.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.624
You let Greg the ghost take you
to a house of worship?!

42:41.626 --> 42:42.792
You did that!

42:42.794 --> 42:44.027
Can I just explain...

42:44.029 --> 42:46.362
Hold on, I've gotta
get another lap in

42:46.364 --> 42:48.331
before I listen to this.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.800
Oh, my...

42:50.802 --> 42:52.402
Alright.

42:57.875 --> 42:58.942
Go.
I just thought that...

42:58.944 --> 42:59.976
It's crazy.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.377
What?

43:01.379 --> 43:02.478
It doesn't matter
what you're about to say

43:02.480 --> 43:04.047
if what you're about to say is

43:04.049 --> 43:05.548
you went to church
with a dead guy.

43:05.550 --> 43:07.483
Who we both had agreed
was not an actual dead guy,

43:07.485 --> 43:10.520
but the kind of dead guy
only crazy people see!

43:10.522 --> 43:11.988
But, you don't...
Crazy!

43:11.990 --> 43:13.923
And I will be completely
honest with you.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.626
You're lookin' a bit off
at the moment.
Off?

43:16.628 --> 43:19.729
Not that you were ever
a picture of "on." No...

43:19.731 --> 43:22.031
Should I leave?
Yes.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.666
Really?

43:23.668 --> 43:26.903
You didn't have an appointment.
You said I could come in!

43:26.905 --> 43:28.137
Why did you come here?

43:28.139 --> 43:29.672
Because I think that this
is an emergency.

43:29.674 --> 43:32.175
No, no, I mean, why did you
come here initially?

43:32.177 --> 43:34.911
I... came here to...

43:34.913 --> 43:36.012
To?

43:36.014 --> 43:37.180
Stop seeing the...

43:37.182 --> 43:38.314
To stop seeing
Greg the ghost,

43:38.316 --> 43:39.882
that's why you came here.

43:39.884 --> 43:42.585
You knew enough to know that
seeing dead people was crazy.

43:42.587 --> 43:43.419
So why,

43:43.421 --> 43:46.122
Walter Gary Benjamin,

43:46.124 --> 43:48.024
are you now going on
dates with him?!

43:48.026 --> 43:49.425
He's very persistant!

43:52.096 --> 43:53.396
Leave.
What?

43:53.398 --> 43:54.998
Seriously, you gotta go.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.666
But... but... I'm trying...
Crazy.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.701
He... you don't understand.
He seems real.

43:58.703 --> 44:00.970
Crazy.
He's got a family,
and I know they're real.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.605
Straight-up batshit.

44:02.607 --> 44:05.308
I'm sorry, Walter, but that's
my professional opinion;

44:05.310 --> 44:07.677
you're beyond fixing. Goodbye.

44:14.685 --> 44:17.153
You know Greg
ain't the problem, right?

44:19.690 --> 44:21.524
I just came here because
I just... I just need...

44:21.526 --> 44:23.092
I know why you think
you came here,

44:23.094 --> 44:24.560
but that doesn't help me,

44:24.562 --> 44:26.129
and I doubt it's doing
much for you either.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.064
Aren't you supposed to ask me
questions about stuff?

44:28.066 --> 44:29.932
Isn't that how this works?

44:29.934 --> 44:31.734
It's a pretty popular
approach, yeah.

44:31.736 --> 44:34.203
What do you think you should
be asking me about?

44:34.205 --> 44:36.339
I got these pages and pages
of notes here,

44:36.341 --> 44:39.709
mostly stuff about Greg.
And try as I might,

44:39.711 --> 44:41.911
with my undeniable
talent and insight,

44:41.913 --> 44:45.448
I can't seem to come up with a
single worthwhile question

44:45.450 --> 44:47.417
out of any of this.

44:50.254 --> 44:52.622
But...

44:52.624 --> 44:55.625
There is one question
we touched on briefly

44:55.627 --> 44:58.628
that I'm thinking might
merit a second look.

45:06.403 --> 45:07.770
Who's Jim?

45:11.910 --> 45:16.112
I love the movies, Dad...

45:20.151 --> 45:21.617
Come on, Walter.

45:36.534 --> 45:38.334
<i>No one is coming.</i>

45:38.336 --> 45:42.271
<i>And we're all gonna starve
to death if we stay up here.</i>

45:42.273 --> 45:44.107
<i>What are you saying?</i>

45:46.010 --> 45:48.911
<i>I'm saying that those things
are still in the house,</i>

45:48.913 --> 45:50.580
<i>and if we stay up here</i>

45:50.582 --> 45:54.217
<i>with no food or no water,
we're all gonna die.</i>

45:54.219 --> 45:55.818
<i>First David.</i>

45:58.355 --> 46:02.792
<i>Then Mersp, Centreller.</i>

46:02.794 --> 46:04.727
<i>And then Teller.</i>

46:04.729 --> 46:07.497
<i>There is no search
and rescue.</i>

46:09.967 --> 46:12.869
<i>We're gonna have to leave.</i>

46:12.871 --> 46:15.872
<i>First, someone's gonna have
to go get it,</i>

46:15.874 --> 46:17.106
<i>and bring it around
the other side of...</i>

46:17.108 --> 46:19.208
Hey, Wally.

46:20.979 --> 46:25.081
Uhh... how'd you know
it was me?

46:25.083 --> 46:26.415
<i>What about me?</i>

46:26.417 --> 46:29.552
You're always sort of here,
aren't you?

46:29.554 --> 46:30.753
<i>Hopefully they'll stay</i>

46:30.755 --> 46:32.622
<i>where I can see really well.</i>

46:32.624 --> 46:36.325
I guess I love movies.

46:36.327 --> 46:40.897
I know. I'm sure
you do, but...

46:40.899 --> 46:44.167
it's different
for you, isn't it?

46:44.169 --> 46:47.203
<i>I don't know, Taylor,
what if they...</i>

46:47.205 --> 46:49.071
Everything sort of is.

46:49.073 --> 46:52.975
<i>You know what happens</i>
<i>if we stay up here.</i>
I'm sorry.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.977
I'm sorry, I'm just...

46:57.447 --> 47:00.383
The crazy thing is,
I really like this movie.

47:04.555 --> 47:07.824
Well, then why are
you crying?

47:07.826 --> 47:09.525
<i>These guys are gonna
be chasing you,</i>

47:09.527 --> 47:11.928
<i>so you'll have
to punch the car...</i>

47:11.930 --> 47:13.963
I don't know.

47:18.269 --> 47:21.003
We're all broken, Wally.

47:26.109 --> 47:27.543
But maybe that's okay.

47:27.545 --> 47:28.678
<i>You got it?</i>

47:28.680 --> 47:30.279
<i>I got it.</i>

47:30.281 --> 47:32.615
<i>Okay, I'm going.</i>

48:42.419 --> 48:44.120
Please go away.

48:49.059 --> 48:50.960
Whatcha prayin' for?

48:50.962 --> 48:52.595
The girl?
It's the girl, right?

48:52.597 --> 48:55.464
Askin' Daddy to pull
a few strings? I like it.

48:55.466 --> 48:58.067
I mean, if the Son of God can't
get the girl of his dreams,

48:58.069 --> 49:01.737
really, what chance does
true love have in this world?

49:03.073 --> 49:04.540
Why are you doing this?

49:04.542 --> 49:09.545
Allie will be someone else's
wife in less than an hour.

49:09.547 --> 49:11.514
Please.
I can't help you.

49:11.516 --> 49:13.115
What if I told you everything?

49:13.117 --> 49:14.951
What?

49:16.954 --> 49:18.688
Like everything.

49:18.690 --> 49:21.657
The stuff that you normally
see when you...

49:21.659 --> 49:23.526
look into someone's
soul or whatever.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.962
I'll just lay it out there.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.797
It doesn't work that way,
and even if it did,

49:27.799 --> 49:29.065
how would I know you were
telling me the truth?

49:29.067 --> 49:30.566
You don't even
have the instincts

49:30.568 --> 49:32.001
to tell if a man's
lying or not?

49:32.003 --> 49:33.235
Ask me anything!

49:33.237 --> 49:34.570
You think I'm bullshitting you
in any way,

49:34.572 --> 49:36.339
I will leave you
alone forever.

49:36.341 --> 49:38.341
I can't really get
into the logistics...
She was gonna leave me.

49:38.343 --> 49:40.710
Why are you telling me this?

49:42.279 --> 49:46.549
You might understand this...
unrequited pining thing

49:46.551 --> 49:51.053
or whatever you're doing
with Popcorn Girl, but, uhh...

49:51.055 --> 49:55.558
to actually have the girl,
to have her love you...

49:55.560 --> 49:59.362
like, start a family together...

49:59.364 --> 50:01.864
to know someone in such a
perfect way, like completely,

50:01.866 --> 50:04.700
that's the best, man.

50:04.702 --> 50:07.169
That's the best. I had that.

50:09.706 --> 50:11.474
So you think I'm
afraid of Hell?

50:11.476 --> 50:14.577
That's Hell. Worse than Hell.
Having that, losing it.

50:14.579 --> 50:18.748
Don't need you or God
or anyone else

50:18.750 --> 50:20.983
to explain that to me.

50:23.755 --> 50:25.921
So what do you say, Walter?

50:25.923 --> 50:28.190
Walter?

50:28.192 --> 50:30.659
Deal with me, you chicken-shit
little bitch...

50:30.661 --> 50:32.828
How'd you die?

50:35.999 --> 50:38.534
What am I supposed...
How did you die?

50:50.013 --> 50:52.615
I mean...

50:52.617 --> 50:54.550
she was my life.

51:07.264 --> 51:10.232
I answer your question,
and you run off.

51:10.234 --> 51:11.567
Poor form, Son of God.

51:11.569 --> 51:13.636
Poor form. What are you doing?

51:13.638 --> 51:15.237
We have to go.

51:15.239 --> 51:16.338
Go where?

51:16.340 --> 51:17.540
Another field trip.

51:32.556 --> 51:34.090
No.

51:34.092 --> 51:35.291
You think it started
already?

51:35.293 --> 51:36.525
What does it matter?

51:36.527 --> 51:38.594
It's not like you're
invited.

51:38.596 --> 51:39.795
Whoa, hey, Walter!

51:39.797 --> 51:41.263
I need to talk to her!
Whoa!

51:41.265 --> 51:42.865
Don't do this, man!

51:42.867 --> 51:45.668
You can't just show up
at her wedding.

51:45.670 --> 51:48.370
Hey, hey, what's the plan here?

51:52.810 --> 51:54.543
Excuse me.
...honourable estate.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.212
Excuse me!
Made by God in Paradise,

51:56.214 --> 51:57.680
into its holy...

51:57.682 --> 51:58.682
Excuse me!

51:59.750 --> 52:01.250
Uhh... sorry, sorry.

52:01.252 --> 52:02.451
I'm sorry to interrupt.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.620
Son, I'm sorry, this is
a private ceremony.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.455
I need to talk to the...
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave right now.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.824
My name is Walter Gary Benjamin,
I need to talk to the bride!

52:08.826 --> 52:10.392
Really?

52:10.394 --> 52:11.827
Wait!

52:13.498 --> 52:15.865
It's okay, I know him.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.555
Uhh, Allie...

52:39.557 --> 52:44.160
Can you give us a minute?
Please?

52:44.162 --> 52:47.463
Just trust me, I...

52:47.465 --> 52:48.764
You yell if you need me.

52:48.766 --> 52:50.166
I will.

52:54.771 --> 52:58.340
I gotta say, your timing
could use some work.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.076
Do you know why I'm here?

53:04.181 --> 53:05.381
Do you?

53:09.886 --> 53:12.154
You were at the rehearsal too,
weren't you?

53:12.156 --> 53:16.959
I couldn't quite place
you then, but...

53:20.030 --> 53:22.698
You look just like him.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.810
Are you okay?

53:36.247 --> 53:37.646
No.

53:40.484 --> 53:43.252
No, I'm not.

53:43.254 --> 53:44.334
Walter.

53:53.663 --> 53:54.863
Walter?

54:24.661 --> 54:27.129
Oh, this smells so good.

54:27.131 --> 54:28.764
Well, you probably won't be able
to keep much down

54:28.766 --> 54:30.399
once you start chemo.

54:30.401 --> 54:33.168
I figured you should have a shot
at some real food beforehand.

54:34.070 --> 54:37.373
Last meal, so to speak.

54:37.375 --> 54:38.874
Don't say that.

54:43.714 --> 54:47.916
Is it bad... that I love you?

54:55.825 --> 54:58.160
I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
No, no, no, no.

55:00.964 --> 55:02.898
It's okay.

55:11.541 --> 55:15.077
<i>Doctor Forrest, dial 118,
please.</i>

55:15.079 --> 55:18.080
<i>Doctor Forrest,
please dial 1-1-8.</i>

55:25.589 --> 55:27.790
Mom?

55:27.792 --> 55:30.125
Mom? Mom! Mom!

55:36.767 --> 55:39.835
Stop it, stop it.
Stop it! Stop!

55:39.837 --> 55:42.438
Stop!

55:42.440 --> 55:44.573
No, stop, stop!
Walter?

55:44.575 --> 55:47.042
Wal... hey, Walter, honey,
take a deep breath.

55:47.044 --> 55:49.845
Are you okay?
I'm calling 911.
No, Darren, he's...

55:49.847 --> 55:51.146
This is crazy!

55:51.148 --> 55:52.214
Walter, it's okay, honey.
No, no, no...

55:52.216 --> 55:53.515
Okay, look, take a deep breath

55:53.517 --> 55:55.050
and come sit down
for a moment, okay?

55:55.052 --> 55:56.318
She is a nurse, listen to her!
Okay, Darren...

55:56.320 --> 55:57.320
I should go.

55:57.321 --> 55:59.788
I loved him!

55:59.790 --> 56:01.190
If that matters.

56:03.660 --> 56:05.694
So did I.

56:05.696 --> 56:07.663
And it doesn't.

56:19.075 --> 56:20.109
Hey!

56:27.951 --> 56:29.852
Told you it was a bad idea.

56:29.854 --> 56:31.453
Why didn't you say anything?

56:31.455 --> 56:35.057
Look, man, I had my own shit
to figure out here.

56:35.059 --> 56:36.492
How was I supposed
to know about...

56:36.494 --> 56:38.427
Wait, you knew about Jim
and Allie this whole time?

56:38.429 --> 56:42.831
Look, I think maybe we should,
uhh, calm down a bit, before...

56:42.833 --> 56:45.200
Answer the question.

56:45.202 --> 56:47.169
Of course I fuckin' knew.

56:47.171 --> 56:48.971
You gonna try
and tell me you didn't?

56:50.874 --> 56:51.974
What?

56:51.976 --> 56:54.443
I mean, really.

56:54.445 --> 56:56.178
How long do we
keep doing this?

56:56.180 --> 56:57.446
I didn't even know
that she existed

56:57.448 --> 56:58.547
until you brought me
over here yourself.

56:58.549 --> 57:01.350
We both know nothing happened
that you didn't already know.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.952
No, no, no. Everything made
sense until you showed up.

57:03.954 --> 57:05.287
Everything made sense

57:05.289 --> 57:06.922
until you started
thinkin' about shit.

57:06.924 --> 57:07.924
No, no-no, no-no.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.558
Don't, don't.

57:11.594 --> 57:12.895
Don't!

57:12.897 --> 57:14.496
Hey, man,
why am I still here?

57:14.498 --> 57:15.564
Leave me alone!

57:15.566 --> 57:17.099
If you wanted me
to leave you alone,

57:17.101 --> 57:20.102
you would have done your job!
But maybe,

57:20.104 --> 57:22.584
it's not really
your job, after all.

57:24.674 --> 57:26.074
How do you know?

57:31.648 --> 57:32.748
Come on.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.150
Really? We're doing that?

57:35.152 --> 57:36.718
Alright.
Leave me alone!

57:36.720 --> 57:38.020
Okay.

57:38.022 --> 57:41.023
You know, I did a
little cross-country

57:41.025 --> 57:43.091
in high school.

57:43.093 --> 57:44.460
Plus I'm dead!

57:44.462 --> 57:47.496
So I don't have to,
you know, breathe!

57:47.498 --> 57:49.932
You might wanna re-think the
"outrunning me" plan!

57:57.508 --> 57:59.875
Leave me alone!

58:56.467 --> 58:58.267
That worked out well for ya.

58:59.936 --> 59:01.203
Get outta here.

59:10.980 --> 59:13.615
You know, I forgave her.
Allie.

59:13.617 --> 59:14.850
A long time ago, actually.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.785
That's the funny thing
about bein' dead:

59:16.787 --> 59:20.455
you don't really dwell on the
things that you'd expect to.

59:20.457 --> 59:24.626
See, the only thing that
really sticks with you,

59:24.628 --> 59:27.729
haunts you even,

59:27.731 --> 59:30.399
is the overwhelming feeling
that you were alive,

59:30.401 --> 59:34.469
you fucking existed,
and you wasted it.

59:36.306 --> 59:40.609
Ten years is
a long time to waste.

59:45.181 --> 59:46.782
You ready?

59:50.019 --> 59:51.753
You tell me.

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.073
Walt?

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.075
Mom.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:01.343
I heard...

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.649
I sent Jim to Hell.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.020
What?

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:15.056
I sent Jim to Hell
right after he died,

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:17.726
and there's nothing
I can do about it now.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:20.862
Are you feeling okay?

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:22.330
Would you like me
to make you some eggs?

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:23.865
I'm not hungry.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.770
Maybe I should make up a batch,

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:31.206
just in case your body is so
calorie-deprived you're...

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.208
starting to feed
on your organs.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.876
I'm not hungry, Mom.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.244
Now see, that's the thing
about the more advanced

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:37.246
stages of starvation...

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:39.848
I'm not fucking hungry!

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.357
I sent him to Hell.
Don't you want to know why?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.128
You're not making any sense.

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.430
We never talk about it,
but you knew, didn't you?

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:01.670
I think you need
some sleep...

01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:04.673
He broke your heart.
That's what you need.

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:07.943
Walt...
He broke your heart,
and I sent him to Hell for it.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:12.113
Walt...
You used to be different.
You used to be happy.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:14.382
You weren't always like...

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.618
Like what?
Like this!

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.789
Your father was a good man!

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:23.058
And her husband...
that woman had a husband,

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.559
in case you didn't know that,

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.928
her husband found out,
and he killed himself,
Walt...

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.797
because Jim and Allie cared
more about themselves

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:30.765
than they ever did
about anybody else!

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:33.301
Your father made a mistake!

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:35.170
Now, you can't
blame him for that!

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:37.572
Jim wasn't my father.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:42.344
Will you stop it?
You stop it, right now!

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:44.479
He wasn't perfect!

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:47.449
But he loved us, and you.

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:49.784
He loved you more
than anything!

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:51.586
More than Allie?

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.121
That's enough!

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:01.296
Do you wanna know what
broke my heart, Walt?

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:02.931
Really?

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.901
Because it wasn't just him
messing around with some nurse,

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:08.737
right after he found out
he was dying.

01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:12.607
Yeah, that hurt.
And I let him know.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:17.178
But it couldn't erase
a lifetime with him.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.214
Not even close!

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.615
And it wasn't even him dying.

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:24.219
I had the strength to get us
through losing him.

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:27.722
And you're right,
I was different then.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:30.025
I was strong, Walt!

01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:32.494
I was strong enough
to watch him die!

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:35.697
But it wasn't losing him
that broke me!

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:38.767
It was losing you
that killed me.

01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:47.242
Now there's eggs on the wall,
and on the floor,

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:48.843
if you're hungry.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:41.896
Hell, hell.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:43.898
Hell.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.301
Hell.

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:50.472
Hell, hell, hell. Hell.

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.555
Theatre 6 down the hall
to your right. Hell.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.593
Theatre 1, down the hall
to your left.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:12.994
Hell.

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:18.133
Theatre 6, hell.

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:20.068
Hell. Hell.

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:22.871
You're all going to hell!

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:25.507
- What?
- All of you.

01:07:28.245 --> 01:07:30.945
Okay.

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:00.875
You look like shit.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:03.645
Forgive me for stating the
obvious, but it's so obvious

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:05.780
I felt personally and
professionally obligated

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.482
to say something about it.

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:09.517
When's the last time
you slept?

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:10.985
I don't know.

01:08:10.987 --> 01:08:13.721
Ate?

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:17.125
Eggs.
I think I had eggs.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:18.158
When?

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.462
I don't... I don't remember.

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:25.867
Well, I won't ask
about bathing,

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.736
'cause I think I know
the answer to that one.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:31.171
How's Greg?

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.211
You know, your ghost friend.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.580
I thought you didn't
wanna talk about Greg.

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:39.781
I don't, but you do, right?

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.082
Not anymore.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:44.519
Well, that's why
we're here, right?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.920
Your ghost problem?

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.723
I'm not crazy.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.725
Are you sure?

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.362
I don't...

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.134
I don't know. I... I...

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.537
You're just supposed to...

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:03.671
What am I supposed to do?

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.640
Just stop. Just stop.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.175
What am I doing, Walter?
You know!

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:10.712
You know! You...
you always know what you...

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:13.148
God, you know exactly what...

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:19.953
I can't... I can't.
I don't know. I don't know.

01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:21.356
I don't know. I don't know.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:25.760
I had control.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:33.434
You can sit there,
and you can... and you can

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.303
tell me what's real,
and what's crazy,

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:37.305
and what's total bullshit
and you can say that

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:39.140
I'm just some kid who doesn't
know how to function properly

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:43.478
in the world, you can say all
that. Okay? Fine. Fine.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:46.848
But I had control.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.883
I woke up every day
and I went outside,

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:51.152
and I did something.

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:54.189
I did something. I never...
I never took a personal day,

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:57.458
I never called in sick,
I never made excuses

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.860
for why life is unfair, I...

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:01.796
I... figured out my place.

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:06.834
I see so many people
that are just...

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:10.338
they're just wasting
so much time,

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.774
doing nothing.

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:15.376
And that's crazy.
That's crazy.

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:22.917
They're...

01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:26.087
Things can happen. Things can
happen. They can be bad.

01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:27.655
They can be worse than bad.
They... they...

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:30.158
they can destroy you
if you let them.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.661
If you even acknowledge them,
they can destroy you,

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:36.064
so I took control
and I made rules,

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.799
and I followed them
without question,

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.867
and I... and I...

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:45.173
I thought... I just thought...
I thought that if I did that,

01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:48.076
then nothing...
could tear me apart,

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:50.778
the way... the way that
cancer did with Jim,

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.214
that life did with my mom.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.899
Sounds crazy?
Does this sound crazy?

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.506
I know this... I know.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:25.013
I know it sounds crazy,
I know it sounds crazy, I...

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.954
I probably am crazy.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.492
I just...

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:41.195
I just need you to help me.
I just need you to help me.

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:44.732
That's what I...
I just need...

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:46.801
I just need you to help me.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.337
I need help.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.178
I'm sorry.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.585
You know how something
really funny

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:07.221
just pops into your head
at like the worst times?

01:12:07.223 --> 01:12:09.424
And the more you try
not to laugh,

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:11.759
the funnier... here I was,
sitting here,

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:13.861
hoping for something
really good,

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:16.664
some legit case-study
crazy shit.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:21.202
And instead...

01:12:21.204 --> 01:12:22.603
...and this is the funny part,

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:26.174
the joke I can't help
but laughing at...

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.376
you're not crazy.

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:30.011
What do you mean?

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.714
You're fine.
This is okay.

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.449
You're not crazy.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:37.251
You are not crazy.

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:40.054
You just forgot to grieve.

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.999
Time's up.

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:05.046
Hey, Walter...

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.881
I don't mean to put you
on the spot or anything,

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.983
but am I still going to hell?

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:14.422
I don't know.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:18.960
I'll see you next week.

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.284
Mom?

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.321
Mom?

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.593
How'd you sleep?

01:18:19.595 --> 01:18:21.262
Okay.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:23.164
I hate not making you anything,

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:26.734
but, um, I didn't
want to be late.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.936
Late?

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:32.707
I, um, have an interview...

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.809
for a job.

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:36.844
That's great, Mom.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.279
Yeah.

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:41.582
Yeah, it is.

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:45.845
Have a nice day
at work, Walt.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.328
Thank you.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.058
<i>- My name is
- Walter Gary Benjamin.</i>

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.694
<i>My friends call me "Wally."</i>

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:06.734
<i>My mom has always
gone with "Walt."</i>

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:10.404
<i>And my dad, whenever
I talked to him,</i>

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.139
<i>he'd go with "Walter."</i>

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:15.342
<i>He's dead, by the way, my dad.</i>

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:18.445
<i>But I'm not.</i>

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:22.716
Oh, late again, stupid fuck.
Hey, you keep this up,

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:24.885
you're going to be the permanent
trash bitch around here.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:25.887
Vince?
Yeah?

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:27.922
Fuck you.

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:30.925
When you're late, I can't
give Vince the shit work

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:34.728
and I enjoy giving
Vince the shit work.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.634
Hey, you don't
have your vest on.

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:48.342
Hey.

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.544
Hey.
