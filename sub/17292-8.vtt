What are you reading?

I die over a perfectly hit seventh.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.929
[applause]

00:13.012 --> 00:15.515
That's the end of the first song, right?
I just missed the first song?

00:15.598 --> 00:17.225
That was the encore.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.728
- Where are you going? Don't leave.
- I'm gonna grab a drink with Hank.

00:19.811 --> 00:22.021
Please, just stay and we'll talk this out.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.567
Paula, I need a minute.
I need to cool off.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.526
Splamf!

00:26.609 --> 00:28.486
It's a Statue of Liberty keychain.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.822
- 'Cause you're from New York.
- I love it!

00:30.905 --> 00:32.907
Our relationship has
always been one-sided.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.702
- I give, you take.
- That's not fair. That hurts me.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.662
You've never been there for me
when I need you.

00:38.329 --> 00:42.333
I know what you want, you know.
You want <i>me </i>to apologize.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.587
<i>You know what, though?</i>
<i>You owe</i> me<i> the apology this time.</i>

00:45.670 --> 00:48.590
I told her that your name is Madge
and my name is Allegra.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.384
- Madge?
- Tell me about the boyfriend, girlfriend.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.889
His name is Josh and I feel bad for him.
He's been through some really tough times.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.640
Had some toxic relationships.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.519
This one girl quit her job, and then
moved across the country to be with him.

Hey, we're busy around here.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.898
I put slices of cheese in there
and some loose bread.

01:46.981 --> 01:50.193
Get yourself a knife and you're
in the sandwich-making business, buddy.

01:51.194 --> 01:55.573
Great. Now, I have to steal a quiche
from the teachers' lounge again.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.451
You know, you should say
"thank you" to your dad!

01:58.535 --> 01:59.577
[door closes]

02:00.662 --> 02:04.457
Seriously, thank you, honey. I just...
I couldn't do all of this without you.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.709
- Oh, it's nothing. I...
- Oh, it's something.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.504
And it means a lot to me. You're the best.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.256
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.175
I was just telling Sunil the other day
how lucky I am.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.510
I had sex with Tanya.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.427
[laughs] Ha!

02:16.511 --> 02:17.804
Yeah, I had sex with Nancy...

02:19.222 --> 02:21.099
Kerrigan.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.813
- Oh, you're serious.
- It was an accident, I swear.

02:26.896 --> 02:30.525
We went drinking after work
with some other people and I had too much.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.570
She was gonna drive me home. We got
in her car. She was too drunk to drive.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.864
So, we decided to wait it out
and it started raining--

02:35.947 --> 02:37.532
Okay, that's enough.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.659
So-- ahem--
it sounds so romantic.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.662
It's just, like, a night
that you'll remember forever.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.790
It happened one time, I promise.
It will never happen again.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.459
It was a complete accident. I...

02:50.545 --> 02:52.380
You know, I have to get ready for work.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.675
- Wait, let's talk about this.
- Nope, I gotta go.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.760
Okay. We'll talk about it
when we get home.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.804
Home? What home?

03:00.930 --> 03:03.683
You don't live here anymore.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.027
Oh, hi. Sorry. I'm almost done.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.696
It's okay. I'm just making
my iced mocha. I can wait.

It's hard.
The water splooshes around,

04:01.366 --> 04:05.119
and how am I supposed to open the door
while I'm holding a shaky tray of water?

04:06.287 --> 04:09.958

- It's <i>me!</i>

04:13.294 --> 04:15.421
It is okay. Don't worry about it.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.174
I'll just fill up a tray and wait outside
the freezer for three hours

04:18.258 --> 04:20.551

you <i>son of a bitch!</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:26.808

04:39.779 --> 04:41.322
[sniffles]

04:41.406 --> 04:42.573
I know why you're crying.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.912
It's because of me and I get it.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.748
I miss our friendship too,
so let's stop all this foolishness

04:50.832 --> 04:54.460
and just go back
to the way things were, okay?

04:54.544 --> 04:58.089
I'm willing to overlook all of the things
on your end that you did wrong.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.009
The apology tears in your eyes--
you don't have to say it, I'll say it.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.594
You're sorry.
Whew.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.806
Didn't that feel good?
And you know what? I'm sorry, too.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.766
- I'll say it.
- Would you just shut up?

05:12.854 --> 05:17.734
You're just such a selfish, whiny,
entitled brat. Just stop.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.447
- You talk?
- What? I talk all the time.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.700
You're too busy staring at...

05:25.783 --> 05:28.911
the narcissist pond
of your bewitching self to even notice.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.872
Wow.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.958
You're mean... and poetic.

05:35.084 --> 05:39.505
Okay. Paula, if it's not about us,
then what's wrong?

05:42.216 --> 05:44.719
- Scott is...
- Gay. I knew it. I knew it.

05:44.802 --> 05:47.013
I always knew it.
I didn't say anything. That's on me.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.348
He had sex with Tanya from work.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.642
Why would he have sex
with Tanya if he's gay? Good God,
you're really a piece of work, sister.

05:54.020 --> 05:58.191
So, this is our dynamic now? Great.
God, I'm so sorry, Paula.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.526
It's just-- it's what
my father always told me.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.572
That if I ever tried to make something
of myself, that no man would want me.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.992
And so, just, like, the minute
that I try to pursue my dreams,

06:08.076 --> 06:12.288
my husband "accidentally" falls
into another woman's vagina.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.456
God.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.250
I mean, I threw him out,
so I'm by myself,

06:16.334 --> 06:19.754
and, you know, Scott used to do
a lot of stuff around the house.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.131
The morning rush used to be
like an Olympic event,

06:22.215 --> 06:24.383
and now it's gonna be like
<i>The Hunger Games.</i>

06:24.467 --> 06:27.637
It's like... like a dystopian nightmare.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.475
Just children fighting for food,
trying to kill each other.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.312
At least, you have the weekend
to start to figure things out.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.064
No, well, I mean, this weekend,

06:38.147 --> 06:42.652
I was supposed to go on a class trip
to Sacramento to tour the Supreme Court,

06:42.735 --> 06:46.155
but, I mean, I'm definitely not going now.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.785
I can't go. Oh, my God. I can't...
I can't talk about this anymore.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.912
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go back to work.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.705
[sighs]
Oh--!

06:57.041 --> 06:59.752
-[door closes]
-So, what are we gonna do, Mrs. H?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.965
Oh, now, we're back to this?

07:08.010 --> 07:09.011
So, what do you think?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.806
This is, like, the new hangout
in the San Gabriel Valley.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.976
Is that where we are?
I thought this was the Inland Empire.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.187
Common mistake, but no.
It's the San Gabes Vals, babes.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.607
I can't believe it took a month of dating
to get me to come out here and visit.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.359
Super cute.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.069
Ah-choo! [sniffles]

07:25.153 --> 07:26.320
Are you sick?

07:26.404 --> 07:29.657
I hope not.
I have this big thing coming up.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.534
There's, like, a super cool party
at Spiders.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.704
They're doing a party where they have
all these advertisers and...

07:34.787 --> 07:36.289
A sponsored party. Fun.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.458
Yeah. We're doing
a little something special.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.920
Let's just say I'm "involved,"
and I was hoping you would come.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.673
I would, but I'm working.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.468
It's the Teen Sports Awards this weekend,

07:48.551 --> 07:51.012
and I'm gonna have my hands full
with 13-year-old celebrity unibrows.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.265
Okay, then. I'll miss you.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.893
Oh--

07:56.976 --> 07:59.687
if you're coming down with something,
I probably shouldn't smooch ya.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.564
Oh.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.482
Okay.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.613
Hey, Mom. Where's my volcano?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.365
I need a live volcano today.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.576
I don't have time for that.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.787
- You need to ask Brendan to help you.
- He left again.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.999
I found this note taped
to the mannequin under his sheets.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.126
"Hopped a Greyhound cross country.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.338
Be back when I run out of the money
I took from Mom's purse."

08:25.421 --> 08:26.672
Oh, God.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.842
Who's gonna take you to school now?
How am I supposed to do all this?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.844
I volunteer as tribute!

08:32.762 --> 08:35.806
District Nine will take Tommy
to the Capitol!

08:36.849 --> 08:38.935
-Honey, what are you doing?
-<i>The Hunger Games.</i>

08:39.018 --> 08:40.895
You said your life was gonna
be like <i>The Hunger Ga--</i>

08:40.978 --> 08:43.356
I read the first book last night
just for this moment.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.900
Okay, I'm here to help.

08:45.983 --> 08:50.321
Yeah, I brought myself,
I brought food, I brought toys.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.698
Here you go. Here you go, buddy. Enjoy.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.409
How?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.912
Okay, Rebecca, I know
that your heart is in the right place,

08:57.995 --> 09:00.289
- but I have so much to deal with...
- I'm sorry.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.711
I'm sorry, okay?
I'll say it first because I should.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.839
I was more wrong.
I was the more wronger one.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.967
That's horrible grammar.
Do not emulate that grammar.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.554
Look, you said to me at my house
that I didn't support you.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.889
You were right.

09:18.474 --> 09:22.687
Every time we talk, I...
I'm really just thinking about myself,

09:22.770 --> 09:24.939
I'm thinking about the next piece
of advice to ask you for,

09:25.022 --> 09:30.069
and I never think about you,
so let me think about you now, okay?

09:30.152 --> 09:33.656
I love you and I'm here to help.
Let me do something.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.741
I'll be like "Mr. Mom," okay?

09:35.825 --> 09:39.161
Your own personal Michael Keaton,
and then you can go on that field trip.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.747
Oh, no, no, no. I can't do that.
Tommy needs me,

09:41.831 --> 09:45.418
and, you know, so does Brendan,
theoretically, wherever he is.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.545
Yeah, so, first of all, we both know

09:47.628 --> 09:49.005
[whispers]
that Brendan is kind of a lost cause.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.756
- Not in front of Tommy.
- Sorry.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.676
And second of all,
you can't not go on a field trip, Paula.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.637
If I had skipped Presidential Classroom
in Washington DC,

09:56.721 --> 10:01.100
I would still be a virgin who knew nothing
about the Electoral College. You gotta go.

10:01.183 --> 10:05.771
You can't miss something like this
because someone else messed up.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.982
Are you sure you know
what you're signing up for?

10:08.065 --> 10:11.861
Because this is just--
it is so much harder than it looks.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.823
I mean, parenting turns you
into, well, me.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.199
Come on, Mom.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.037
Let her help. Then you can go on
your weird grown-up field trip thingy.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.038
[sighs]
Oh...!

10:22.121 --> 10:24.123
Yeah, you don't understand
what you're taking on.

10:24.206 --> 10:28.544
Okay, look, it's gonna be the weekend,
and Tommy's not gonna be in school,

10:28.628 --> 10:31.964
which means he will be with you
the whole time.

10:32.048 --> 10:36.260
Paula, it's okay.
I've cleared my schedule.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.306
I've only made plans for this.
It'll all be fine.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.434
I swear I can do it.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.560
[sighs]

10:45.019 --> 10:47.688
- Okay. So, emergency numbers are--
- Got it.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.399
Ugh! It's not that big a deal.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.985
All I got to do
is keep you alive for 48 hours.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.655
Really? That's where
we're setting the bar?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.573
Yeah, it is, kid. Yeah, it is.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.116
[sighs]
Oh, wow.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.912
You know, I gotta say, I think this
whole mom thing is gonna be really easy.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.205
Do you even have kids?

11:04.288 --> 11:05.456
[laughs]

11:05.539 --> 11:06.957
No. No, no, no.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.378
But I do have a lot of things
that are more important, like my smarts,

11:10.461 --> 11:15.007
my feminine intuition, and this amazing
podcast called <i>Mom Time Daily</i>

11:15.091 --> 11:18.552

what an honor it is for you

how to be a mom,

12:29.665 --> 12:32.042

from other "mothers."

[Rebecca]
Oh!

13:29.225 --> 13:32.228
Hey, hey, hey. So, it's Saturday.
What do you wanna do?

13:32.311 --> 13:36.190
I woke up early to turn on the cartoons,
but then you slept for three hours, so...

13:36.273 --> 13:37.274
[chuckles]

13:37.358 --> 13:39.026
You didn't make any plans for us?

13:40.319 --> 13:42.947
No, you-- what, what?
You don't have anything to do?

13:43.030 --> 13:46.200
You don't have baseball
or soccer or improv?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.452
Don't you need to start padding
that resumé for college?

13:48.536 --> 13:51.622
College? Who needs college
when you got this pretty face?

13:51.705 --> 13:53.541
Wow, precocious. You know what?

13:53.624 --> 13:56.168
It's your day,
so just tell me what you want to do.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.753
- Anything?
- Anything at all.

13:57.836 --> 14:01.215
I'm Mr. Mom, which means I'm a dad,
which means fun stuff.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.509
Great. I'd like to try smoking and beer.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.510
Oh...

14:04.593 --> 14:07.137
and I'd like to see naked boobs.
They don't have to be yours though.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.723
Yeah, so none of that's legal.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.810
So, why don't we just
binge-watch a TV show?

14:12.893 --> 14:15.646
I'm thinking <i>Dora the Explorer.</i>

14:15.729 --> 14:18.190
You really don't know
how old I am, do you?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.943
I know you're older than eight
and younger than me.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.111
Hey, tell you what,

14:22.194 --> 14:25.322
why don't we just go get a bunch
of popcorn and watch whatever we want?

14:25.406 --> 14:27.324
Sounds good? All right.
<i>Vamonos, </i>Boots.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.993
And also, FYI,

14:29.076 --> 14:32.496
boobs are really just sacks of yellow fat,
so not worth the whole obsession.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.706
Ugh...!

14:33.789 --> 14:36.292
Now, where does your mom
keep your car seat?

14:40.421 --> 14:43.465
Why is your friend on a sign
for the thing my mom calls my dad?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.886
Oh, a douche.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.930
Tommy, do you know what douches are?

14:50.723 --> 14:55.185
Okay, this is a great opportunity
for you to soak up some wisdom from a lady

14:55.269 --> 14:57.521
who understands
something called "the patriarchy."

14:57.605 --> 15:02.359
So, douches are a product created by
a corporation that are meant to exploit...

15:02.443 --> 15:04.320
OMG, it's my ex. Okay, this is really awkward

15:06.363 --> 15:09.575
because the last time I saw him,
I peed on all of his stuff.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.868
[laughs] Up top.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.995
Thanks.

15:13.078 --> 15:18.167
You know what? There's Josh Chan,
but who cares? I feel nothing.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.543
Quick emotional scan--

15:19.627 --> 15:21.712
boop, boop, boop--
no, nothing.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.798
I'm in remission.
Yeah, I'm not even gonna say hi.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.842
Watch, I'm not gonna say hi.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.429
Hi! Hi, Josh! Hi.

15:30.512 --> 15:34.516
Hi, Rebecca. How have you been?
I haven't seen you since...

15:34.600 --> 15:35.601
She peed on your stuff.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.145
Uh...

15:38.479 --> 15:41.023
Sorry. This is Paula's son, Tommy.

15:41.106 --> 15:46.487
He's my... my ward, my protégé,
my charge for the day.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.364
- I'm babysitting.
- Oh, cool.

15:48.447 --> 15:53.494
Hey, Tommy, why don't you go
get yourself some candy, my man?

15:53.577 --> 15:57.665
- This is a hundred-dollar bill.
- Oh, sorry.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.958
There you go. That should be enough.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.501
[chuckles]

16:00.709 --> 16:01.710
Kids.

16:02.544 --> 16:06.465
So, hey, I've been meaning
to apologize to you about,

16:06.548 --> 16:08.050
as Tommy said, the peeing.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.722
I have no excuse
other than I felt primal that day,

16:13.806 --> 16:17.309
but I hope it didn't fritz out
any of the expensive equipment.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.436
It's fine. Stuff happens. Listen, Josh, I'm glad we ran
into each other, honestly.

16:21.647 --> 16:25.693
because I hope that after everything
that has happened,

16:25.776 --> 16:26.986
that we can still be friends.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.906
Wow. Yeah, me too.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.492
I thought you would still be mad
because of the way we broke up.

16:33.575 --> 16:38.330
No, I made mistakes. You made mistakes.
You made some other more mistakes.

16:38.414 --> 16:42.710
- We're human.
- I'm so glad to hear that. Yeah.

16:42.793 --> 16:46.046
Yeah. And, oh, I saw that you have
a new lady in your life.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.007
Is her name Hannah?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.717
- Anna.
- Anna!

16:49.800 --> 16:53.679
Oh, right, Anna. I saw you post
about it online. Not all the posts.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.057
A normal amount of posts.
Let's say three. I saw three posts.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.767
Anyway, she's... whoo!

16:58.851 --> 17:02.563
She's breathtaking, Josh.
So, good job, sir.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.232
[chuckles]
Thank you. Yeah, wow.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.277
I mean, I'm relieved
we can just be normal about this.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.655
- Why would I be weird about it?
- Yeah, right? Exactly.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.617
Well... good to see you.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.871
Yeah, me too.
For me to see you, good. Yeah.

17:19.913 --> 17:25.044
- Hey, come here.
- I'm actually a little sick.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.464
That's what these tissues are for.
I got a little case of the sniffles.

17:28.547 --> 17:33.594
Oh, come on. I don't care.
Friends share their airborne pathogens.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.644
Tommy, you're one lucky little dude
to have Rebecca as a babysitter.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.855
Yeah. She's not bad.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.525
She's more than not bad.
She's Rebecca Bunch. She's the greatest.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.613
[chuckles]
"The greatest"? That's so nice of you.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.240
That's nice. Isn't that nice?
Being hyperbolic?

17:57.993 --> 18:00.370
Yes, just a quart of chicken soup.

18:00.454 --> 18:04.208
And, sorry, just to be clear,
you do not have matzo balls, correct?

18:04.291 --> 18:09.004
No, it's okay. I've just never heard
of chicken soup without them, but okay.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.674
Yes, so send to Josh Chan at Aloha Tech.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.968
All right, now for the note.
Grab a pen. All right.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.346
Hey, Tommy, what do you think
the note should say?

18:17.429 --> 18:20.516
I want it to convey, "I still really care
about you, but not in a needy way.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.726
Just in a friend way
'cause I'm nurturing."

18:24.937 --> 18:29.066
Okay, I'll handle it. Never mind.
Hi, yes. Ready for the note? Great.

18:29.149 --> 18:33.195
Ahem.
"Dear Josh Chan..."

18:33.278 --> 18:35.489
Actually, you know what?
Don't say "Chan." Just "Josh."

18:35.572 --> 18:39.535
Don't write "just Josh."
Just-- no, no. Write just "Josh."

18:39.618 --> 18:41.995
Don't write the word "just."

18:42.079 --> 18:45.332
Okay, never mind. Let's start over.
You ready? Okay.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.626
"Dear Josh..."

19:16.488 --> 19:18.031
Yeah. Also take out the "N."

19:18.115 --> 19:21.326
Too formal, I agree. Okay. Thanks.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.495
[sighs]

19:24.288 --> 19:26.915
Just to let you know, I would have
done that for any sick friend.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.042
I'm not doing it just because it's Josh.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.712
He did look really sick, though.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.756
Do you think Anna's taking care of him?

19:34.840 --> 19:38.051
I mean, 'cause here's this guy, green
to the gills, getting his own tissues.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.262
Why, 'cause she's busy with eyebrows?

19:41.263 --> 19:45.350
Clearly, there's an "I" in eyebrows.
You know what I'm saying?

19:45.434 --> 19:48.353
Feel free to weigh in, Tommy-o!
Tommy boy. Oh, my God.
Can you just stop talking?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.483
I'm trying to look at boobs.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.110
[gasps]

19:55.194 --> 19:57.613
Thomas "No Idea What
Your Middle Name Is" Proctor!

19:57.696 --> 20:00.616
Is this an adult-themed publication?

20:00.699 --> 20:03.952
You gave me five months' allowance
and no guidelines.

20:05.454 --> 20:09.833
Okay. So, Tommy, you're not in trouble.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.085
But I think it's important that you know

20:12.169 --> 20:16.173
that pornography does not accurately
reflect adult sexual behavior.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.759
- Do you always make big speeches?
- Yes, I do.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.469
- Oh, man.
- So, let's put it this way.

20:20.552 --> 20:25.682
Pornography is to sex
as superhero movies are to seventh grade.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.392
- Do you get what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.020
You're saying that seventh grade
is going to be awesome.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.529
Hey, delivery for you. Chicken soup.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.741
That is so nice of you.
Thank you, Alex.

20:42.824 --> 20:46.328
It's not from me. There's something
in the bottom. It's all wet.

20:46.411 --> 20:50.874
Is that a note? No, it can't be a note.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.919
Who put this crazy long of a note
in a soup delivery?

20:54.002 --> 20:58.757
It must be a shopping list or something.
I guess you have an anonymous soup fairy.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.843
No, I know who it is.
My girlfriend Anna.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.348
She is the best.
This is exactly what I love about her.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.893
Who else would take the time
out of their day to take care of me?

21:09.977 --> 21:13.105
I gotta get a selfie with the soup
and tag her. Can you take it?

21:13.188 --> 21:15.691
I can, but then it's not a selfie.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.194
It's a picture with "myself-ie,"
so it's a selfie.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.073
- How do you not see that?
- Got me there, bro.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.992
Chicken soup!

21:25.075 --> 21:29.496
So, you're on Instagram,
but I thought you had to be at least 13.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.706
[laughs]

21:30.789 --> 21:32.416
Well, I hope your account is private. Why? I've made a lot of friends.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.211
Men who like birdwatching,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.213
men who fly drones,
men who build basements.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.718
Okay, Tommy, let's... let's have a talk.
It's another little lecture.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.637
So, you need to understand
how pre-teen boys are viewed

21:45.721 --> 21:49.141
by some men
with, let's say, personal issues.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.976
Now, it's not just men.

21:51.059 --> 21:54.229
Female phys-ed teachers can also be
a problem, but you have to be vigilant--

21:54.313 --> 21:56.315
- oh, my God!
- What's wrong?

21:56.398 --> 21:59.526
Josh posted a selfie of himself
with the soup.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.778
That's not a selfie.
Someone else took that photo.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.740
Okay, whatevs. And--
[squeals] no!

22:04.823 --> 22:06.533
[grunts]

22:06.700 --> 22:10.329
Sorry. He said,
"Thank you, @annathebrowbarian,

22:10.412 --> 22:12.706
the best sweetest girlfriend ever,
for my soup."

22:12.789 --> 22:14.958
That-- he thinks Anna gave him
the soup.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.628
I can't have that happen.
I gotta find him and tell him.

22:18.712 --> 22:22.716
I mean, I mean... I can't let Anna
take credit for my nurturing instincts.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.718
No, I gotta find him. Let's see.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.763
Okay, okay. His Instagram says
right now he's at Spiders.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.515
That's a nightclub downtown
with confusing punctuation.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.726
You know what? I have an idea.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.896
You go to the club, leave me
with some more of those hundos,

22:35.979 --> 22:39.649
and I'll stay home, order myself
some sushi, study my magazines, and...

22:39.733 --> 22:42.402
No, no, no, you don't.
Okay, not falling for that.

22:42.486 --> 22:46.198
Okay, hey, I made a promise to your mom
that I would take care of you,

22:46.281 --> 22:48.075
and I take that responsibility
very seriously,

22:48.158 --> 22:50.118
so I'm not leaving you home alone.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.245
Now, come on. Let's get you a fake ID
so we can go clubbin'.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.586
[music playing]

23:06.093 --> 23:07.469
When did Heather get famous?

23:09.179 --> 23:11.598
What is this?
I asked for whiskey on the rocks.

23:11.681 --> 23:15.310
All they had were branded cocktails.
Enjoy your Soju peachtini.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.104
Soju? What is that?

23:17.187 --> 23:20.774
Dude, it's the most popular
alcoholic beverage in Korea. Get woke.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.110
Okay, that is not
the proper usage of "woke."

23:23.193 --> 23:24.361
Whatever, white man.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.740
- Hey, what's the big surprise?
- Yeah, bro. You look nervous.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.743
Let's just say tonight could
change everything for me.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.579
Could be a real career move.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.165
- What's he talking about?
- I have no idea.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.251
Hmm!

23:39.334 --> 23:41.503
- It's actually not bad.
- Yeah, I love it.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.130
I'm gonna bring a bottle home
for my mom.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.131
[groans]
Mmm.

23:44.214 --> 23:48.176
All right, so your name is Manuel
and you're 27.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.429
Eh. Whatever. Go on in.
I don't care about this job anyway.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.099
- I want to be a stuntman.
- Sorry about that.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.643
- Soju?
- Excuse me?

23:56.726 --> 23:59.771
- Soju.
- "So Jew"?

24:00.564 --> 24:02.232
Okay. <i>Seig Heil,</i> bitch.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.693
All right, Tommy,
here's what's gonna happen.

24:04.776 --> 24:08.238
We're going to go in, find Josh,
tell him about the soup, then leave.

24:09.489 --> 24:12.450
Oh, look, the sign's
grammatically correct! Spiders'.

24:12.534 --> 24:16.121
No, actually, Mr. Spiders went into
business with his brother, Dr. Spiders,

24:16.204 --> 24:18.123
so it's actually "Spiders-es-es."

24:18.206 --> 24:21.209
Actually, that's a common misconception
about how plural possessive works,

24:21.293 --> 24:22.419
but nice try, "Himmler."

24:22.502 --> 24:24.129
Okay, let's go, come on.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.926
- Peek-a-boo!
- What are you doing here?

24:30.010 --> 24:34.097
I got done early and you said you were
doing something special, so here I am.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.350
Oh, my God, you're the best.
It means so much that you're here.

24:37.976 --> 24:38.810
Oh, hey, fellas.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.855
Oh, hey, Rebecca and child
who doesn't belong in a place like this.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.523
He's fine. We're just running an errand.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.775
I'm looking for... for Josh.
Have you seen him?

24:45.859 --> 24:48.486
Yeah, I just saw him with his girlfriend.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.781
Thank you.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.409
Ugh! I'm so stupid,
I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid. Okay.

24:54.492 --> 24:58.788
- Listen, she can't know that I'm here.
- Why not?

24:58.872 --> 25:02.209
Okay, I accidentally almost killed her cat
and she thinks my name is Madge

25:02.292 --> 25:04.961
- and that I live in Silver Lake.
- So, you lied to her?

25:05.045 --> 25:08.381
I didn't lie. You gotta assess the context
and the role of the speaker--

25:10.091 --> 25:12.260
Oh, here comes the soup stealer. Duck!

25:12.344 --> 25:13.762
[music continues]

25:15.263 --> 25:17.641
Tommy, that was close. Tommy?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.895
Tommy, can you hear me?

25:23.063 --> 25:26.316
Tommy, can you see me? Tommy?

25:27.609 --> 25:32.822
Sorry, so I'm not a doctor,
so I cannot diagnose your situation,

25:32.906 --> 25:34.950
but thank you for all of your detail.

25:35.033 --> 25:38.703
I thought you were Miss Douche.
Like, that's supposed to mean something.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.913
Maybe stop douching.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.415
That's probably the cause
of what's going on with you down there.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.709
Whatever. I'll just take
another free douche then.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.127
Ser-- okay.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.006
Don't douche and drive.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.259
[panting]
Heather, Heather! Okay, okay, okay!

25:52.342 --> 25:55.053
Lost child, crowd, his ID says Manuel...

25:55.136 --> 25:57.347
Okay, calm down. What's happening?

25:57.430 --> 25:59.683
Why are you wearing
those ironic mom half-sneakers?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.810
They're not ironic,
and I really need your help right now.

26:01.893 --> 26:06.731
- I lost Paula's son in this club.
- Okay. Just take a deep breath.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.567
We will find him.
This place is not that big.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.153
It's just dark and full of creepy adults.
Crap, let's move.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.239
Let me see if he called me. Nothing.

26:14.322 --> 26:16.992
But... but, he did post on Instagram.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.035
Thank God Paula doesn't know
he has an account.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.829
- Bathroom. He's in the bathroom.
- Bathroom.

26:20.912 --> 26:21.913
- Bathroom.
- Bathroom.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.333
Tommy? Tommy? Tommy?

26:25.417 --> 26:27.210
[door thumps]

26:27.294 --> 26:29.129
Where'd he go?
He was here two minutes ago.

26:29.212 --> 26:33.383
Well, great. Paula and I are done.
Yeah. 'Cause I was making it up to her,

26:33.466 --> 26:36.177
but then I ruined it,
so she'll never forgive me.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.180
Totally. I think you meant to say
you're upset a kid is missing?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.850
- [Josh] Anna, what are we even doing?
- Come on. Follow me.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.184
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

26:43.268 --> 26:45.895
- We gotta find Tommy.
- They can't see me, they can't see me.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.149
I don't think we should be
in the ladies' room.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.735
- Hide your feet, hide your feet.
- It's a unisex bathroom.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.528
They're practically begging for us
to do it in here.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.530
Oh. Cool.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.035
[whispers]
No, no.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.370
No, no, no, this isn't happening.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.496
[faint panting, laughter]

27:03.580 --> 27:07.083
How many times must I sit in the bathroom
listening to Josh Chan

27:07.167 --> 27:09.544
have sex with another woman?

27:10.587 --> 27:11.880
[panting continues]

27:12.881 --> 27:13.965
[grunts]

27:14.049 --> 27:17.344
Oh, he's nasty.

27:17.427 --> 27:20.764
I totally get it now, girl.
Good for you.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.686
-[door closes]
-Okay, they're gone. Let's go!

27:26.770 --> 27:28.605
We gotta find Tommy.
He hasn't responded to my texts

27:28.688 --> 27:31.649
or my Instagram messages.
I don't know what's wrong.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.485
We heard there was sex going on
in the bathroom.

27:33.568 --> 27:36.780
I was gonna come in and stop it, but
now that I see it's you guys, carry on.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.616
- I'll just sit here and watch.
- Our love is not for your gaze.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.659
Come on, let's split up
and look for him.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.827
What she said.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.329
[music playing]

27:44.412 --> 27:47.624
You know, this place is not that bad
for a club in the suburbs.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.293
For starters, the parking lot is huge.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.712
So, Anna, do you know
what Josh's big surprise is?

27:52.796 --> 27:55.215
- No.
- He thinks he can beatbox.

27:55.298 --> 27:59.010
- I really hope it's not that.
- Well, maybe he's a party promoter now.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.638
He did say he thought
this was gonna be a "big career move."

28:01.805 --> 28:02.806

-[scattered applause]
-Oh, no.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.655
No, no.

28:18.738 --> 28:19.656
Uh--!

28:20.156 --> 28:22.242
Anna, could you go
get us drinks at the bar?

28:22.325 --> 28:25.036
- With your back turned? Away from us?
- For the rest of the night.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.247
Or go outside
and check out that cool parking lot. - Yep.
- What? And miss the mall models?

28:29.541 --> 28:32.252
Are you kidding?
This is gonna be hilarious.

28:32.335 --> 28:35.380
[Anna] I mean, this is gonna be
the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

28:37.674 --> 28:41.219
[Anna] Oh my God, look at that guy.
He's so shiny.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.679
Where's Josh? He's missing this.

28:42.762 --> 28:43.722
[nervous chuckling]

28:43.805 --> 28:45.432
He's sure missing something.

28:45.515 --> 28:46.433
[Anna] Wow.

28:46.516 --> 28:50.979
- Oh, this is good.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.566
[Anna] An adult man with a tiger tee?
Hysterical.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.317
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.320
[Anna] This seriously can't get any worse.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.115
[sighs]
Oh...

29:04.033 --> 29:05.618
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.121
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.914
[spectator wolf whistles]

29:21.009 --> 29:22.469
Oh, my...

29:26.556 --> 29:27.599
[plops]

29:32.228 --> 29:35.690
Oh, God, I've left my body. I'm floating
over this room right now, looking down.

29:36.441 --> 29:41.905
Okay, okay. That's over.
That is done. That happened.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.324
Oh, good, he's coming back.
Here he comes.

29:44.407 --> 29:48.286
This is good 'cause we can get
a better look at my boy looking fresh.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.247
- Looking good, dude!
- Go, boo.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.373
[gasping]

29:54.584 --> 29:56.878
- Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
- So sexy.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.463
Mmm. [wincing]

30:00.131 --> 30:01.841
[music playing]

30:01.925 --> 30:03.051
[gasps]
Did you find him?

30:03.134 --> 30:05.678
No, he's not in this club.
I looked everywhere.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.430
Oh, this is such a Rebecca Bunch move!

30:07.514 --> 30:10.225
Because all I had to do
was keep him alive for 48 hours,

30:10.308 --> 30:12.477
and instead, no, no.
I lost him and put him in danger

30:12.560 --> 30:16.314
'cause I'm selfish and I'm stupid,
I'm stupid, I'm stupid.

30:16.397 --> 30:19.275
If you're waiting for me to disagree
with you, that's not gonna happen.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.862
Excuse me. Sorry, guys.
Hey, there you are!

30:22.946 --> 30:26.449
So, how does it feel to be sleeping
with a model? Boom.

30:26.950 --> 30:27.784
[sighs]

30:27.867 --> 30:32.247
Yeah. You know what?
I'm not feeling very well.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.916
I think I'm coming down with that cold.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.461
Don't worry. It's just a couple days
of post-nasal drip and a light cough.

30:38.545 --> 30:43.967
Yeah, I think I'm gonna need
some time to recover.

30:44.050 --> 30:47.846
Great. Okay, you go home and I'll come
over later and bring you some cough drops.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.806
Maybe we can take a hot bath together.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.809
Um... you know what?

30:52.892 --> 30:57.063
Josh, here's the thing.
I really was into you.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.898
I know. I remember the bathroom.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.317
Unisexy.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.653
But now my feelings changed.

31:05.572 --> 31:10.410
- Since 30 minutes ago?
- I'm sorry. It's a thing that happens.

31:10.493 --> 31:13.329
Sometimes, you really like someone,
and then, a switch gets flipped,

31:13.413 --> 31:15.665
and then, suddenly,
you kind of feel like you wanna barf.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.542
- So sorry.
- When did this happen?

31:17.625 --> 31:21.838
It might be when the sleeves zipped off.
I'm not sure. Oh, God. I feel really bad.

31:21.921 --> 31:26.968
- So, okay. What are you saying?
- I'm saying we're over.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.763
Over? But we're a couple.
You just sent me chicken soup. That-- that big tub
of chicken soup you sent me?

31:35.602 --> 31:38.396
What? No. That wasn't...
that wasn't me. I didn't do that.

31:38.479 --> 31:43.026
Well, you take care, Josh. It's been fun.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.487
How did I get here?

31:51.534 --> 31:57.665
Wait, she didn't send me that soup.
So, someone else sent me that soup.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.959
But I don't know who sent me that soup.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.129
How will I find out who sent me
that soup?

32:05.506 --> 32:09.552
[sighs] I was so wrong about Anna.
I thought she was a nice person.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.470
Mm.

32:10.553 --> 32:14.140
- She's not. She's a poo person.
- Wow, Josh.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.600
Watch your mouth, okay, bud?

32:15.683 --> 32:19.604
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Aw, come on. It's not your fault.

32:19.687 --> 32:21.439
Something wrong with my modeling?

32:21.522 --> 32:25.610
Your male modeling?
No. Nope. It was very good.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.112
The soup was the thing
that made me feel

32:28.196 --> 32:30.365
like she was right for me, you know?

32:31.407 --> 32:35.954
And that's what I want in a person.
Someone who's warm and nourishing.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.206
Okay, I talked to Dave at the diner.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.792
I thought he wouldn't remember
one soup order, but apparently,

32:40.875 --> 32:43.044
the person who called it in
made quite an impression.

32:44.212 --> 32:47.298
- Quoted Shakespeare and stuff.
- Ah, so, I guess we know who that is.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.549
- Rebecca.
- Shakespeare.

32:49.676 --> 32:55.014
Rebecca? That makes
perfect sense! It's her!

32:56.391 --> 32:58.309
She knew I was sick.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.813
And she hugged me
even though I was contagious.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.983
Oh, my God, she's amazing.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.944
- Well...
- She has her issues.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.448
Rebecca, of course.
It's always Rebecca, isn't it?

33:12.532 --> 33:15.493
Wherever I turn,
everything points back to her.

You're-- you're home!

35:16.322 --> 35:19.784
Hey, I thought you weren't supposed
to be back until tomorrow.

35:19.867 --> 35:23.955
- Well, I wasn't, but then...
- Tommy!

35:24.205 --> 35:25.623
[gasps]

35:26.290 --> 35:28.918
Wow, you two really bonded.

35:29.001 --> 35:33.131
Yeah, yeah, we did,
over all that volcano stuff.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.387
Yeah, volcano. Yeah, volcano.

35:39.470 --> 35:43.224
Yeah, and I already told my mom about
that bully that destroyed our volcano.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.560
- Right.
- The one that we made.

35:45.643 --> 35:46.894
Yes, right. And...

35:46.978 --> 35:50.523
And then, he sat on it
and it just exploded right up his butt.

35:51.774 --> 35:54.360
Okay. The kid is fine.

35:54.443 --> 35:58.322
The lava was just made of chewable mints
and soda pop, so no harm done.

35:58.406 --> 36:02.076
But I was just at that child's house
talking to his parents very firmly

36:02.243 --> 36:07.373
and saying that any further bullying
would result in legal action.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.125
And then, I TP'd his house.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.505
That is...

36:16.174 --> 36:19.552
exactly what I would have done.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.263
[laughs]
That is the truth.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.599
The truth. It's all about context, right?

36:25.433 --> 36:27.059
Exactly.

Hey, so, Paula, why did you come home?
Is everything okay?

36:33.816 --> 36:37.737
Aw, I just felt bad being away right now.

36:37.820 --> 36:43.534
I missed Tommy, and...
I just started feeling kind of sad.

36:44.327 --> 36:49.498
Well, I'm here,

You are a true friend.
You have been so great.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.644
-Nothing.
-[rapping on door] Who could that be? It's late.

37:18.236 --> 37:22.323
- Josh? What are you doing here?
- I had to come as soon as I knew.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.993
Rebecca, it's you. It's you.
You're my soup fairy.

37:26.077 --> 37:30.665
- Oh, my God, you found out?
- Yes. I know the truth now.

37:30.748 --> 37:33.876
That soup shows that you're the one
who really cares about me.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.338
Well, I know how sad you get
when you're sickie.

37:38.172 --> 37:42.551
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna give you guys a second.

37:44.595 --> 37:50.768
Rebecca, I'm an idiot. I realize now
that all this time, it's been you.

- You've always been there for me.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.524
But what about your girlfriend?

37:56.607 --> 37:58.776
We're over. She's a poo person.

37:58.859 --> 38:01.696
Oh, my God, I thought so too,
but I didn't want to say anything.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.907
Hey, do you want
to go somewhere and talk?

38:04.991 --> 38:08.244
Just me and you,
see where we can go from here?

38:08.327 --> 38:11.080
I... I don't know if I can just leave. Hey, you know what? I just...
I'm sorry to interrupt, but--

38:14.000 --> 38:15.960
and I wasn't listening at all.

38:16.043 --> 38:20.381
I just want to say that...
I mean, you can go.

38:20.464 --> 38:24.844
I am fine, I promise. It's just this is--

38:24.927 --> 38:27.096

- Yeah.

38:38.858 --> 38:42.236
And... and you need to go.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.614
- What?
- What?

38:45.698 --> 38:48.200
I have to take care of my family.

38:48.284 --> 38:51.912
I'm a mom now
and I have other priorities.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.665
Okay.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.211
I guess I'll go.

39:05.968 --> 39:09.889
But I'm not gonna give up on you,
Rebecca, and I'm not gonna give up on us.

39:11.682 --> 39:15.144
But I am gonna get my car out of that
parking lot because it closes at midnight.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.812
- Hi, Paula.
- Hi.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.818
What just happened?

39:23.819 --> 39:27.073
Paula, I gotta tell you the truth.

39:28.824 --> 39:32.578
None of what Tommy or I said earlier
happened. It was all a lie, okay?

39:32.661 --> 39:35.039
What actually happened tonight was...

39:35.122 --> 39:38.542
I went to Spiders to find Josh to tell him
that I'm the one who gave him soup.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.962
And I got Tommy a fake ID and lost him
in the club. I really lost him, Paula.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.089
I thought he was dead.

39:44.632 --> 39:49.261
So... I put your son at risk.
I put our family at risk,

39:49.345 --> 39:54.725
and I completely understand if you don't
want to be friends with me anymore.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.316
I've held on to this every day
since you gave it to me...

40:02.400 --> 40:05.027
and I look at it a lot,
especially in the last few weeks,

40:05.111 --> 40:09.031
when things weren't so good between us,
but I don't deserve the Statue of Liberty.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.953
Did anything happen to him at the club?

40:14.036 --> 40:16.455
Did anyone interfere with him
in the bathroom?

40:16.539 --> 40:18.749
- Did he do any drugs?
- No.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.169
So, he just ran around a club
and took an Uber home?

40:23.629 --> 40:29.093
Oh, God. Honey, I lost him
for an entire weekend at the mall once.

40:29.176 --> 40:32.138
He was living in the Barnes &amp; Noble.
He was so happy there.

40:32.972 --> 40:37.601
Lord, I just-- I have made
a million mistakes with my kids.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.020
I mean, he's fine, clearly.

40:41.897 --> 40:44.692
Wait. Wait, this is okay? Are you sure?

40:44.775 --> 40:49.905
Rebecca, you were here for me
when I needed you,

40:49.989 --> 40:54.118
and right now, you could've sailed right
out that door with Josh, but you didn't.

40:54.201 --> 41:00.749
Instead, you decided to stay
and own up to your mistakes.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.130
That is my brave little cookie.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.634

- I love you, too.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.977
- A weekend in Barnes &amp; Noble?
- Yeah.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.355
Just to clarify. You've never given birth?

41:23.439 --> 41:25.858
Oh, no, no, no.
Would not be a good idea.

41:25.941 --> 41:28.569
Mental illness runs rampant
on both sides of my family.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.489
- Many suicides, many suicides.
- Amazing. All right.

41:31.572 --> 41:36.285
Let's take a quick break to hear a word
from our podcast sponsor, Truly Butter.

41:36.368 --> 41:39.038
"When you're trying to make things right
with your best friend, Paula,

kind of a bitch to, lately,

why not take a break
and eat some butter together?"

Wow, that is weirdly specific
to my own life.
