01:18.161 --> 01:19.537
Lahela!

01:19.621 --> 01:21.289
I love a birthday surf.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.666
You're starting off sixteen right,
baby girl.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.376
I remember when I used to hold you

01:25.460 --> 01:27.045
-in the palm of my hand...
-Dad...

01:28.129 --> 01:29.339
Hottie at twelve o'clock.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.015
Hey, Walter.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.184
Excited for the dance on Friday?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.770
Yeah, I am. 'Cause I'm going with you.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.981
Easy with the <i>shaka,</i> buddy.
I'm right here.

01:49.567 --> 01:50.443
We should go.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.529
I don't want to be late
for my driver's license test.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.072
I'm all grown up.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.198
Aren't you psyched, Dad?

02:13.049 --> 02:15.176
I think you can go a little bit faster.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.970
It's the second time she's passed us.

02:17.053 --> 02:17.929
You got it.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.142
Hey, so what part of the island you from?

02:22.225 --> 02:24.227
The part of the island called,
"Mind your business."

02:24.310 --> 02:26.855
You are not even supposed
to be here, Daddy.

02:26.938 --> 02:27.814
Cool.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.822
Looks like they've got
a big accident up there.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.329
Slow down, yeah? Hey.
We're plenty fast, yeah? Slow down!

02:43.955 --> 02:45.248
Are you crazy?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.583
Lahela!

02:50.378 --> 02:52.839
Hey, return to the vehicle!

02:54.591 --> 02:55.800
Where are you going?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.802
-Excuse me. Hey.
-We got an 11-41.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.846
-Male. Bicycle rider.
-Get outta here.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.806
Few years of age.
Let's roll across on this one.

03:01.890 --> 03:02.932
Let me see him.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.517
So, how she's doing so far?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.936
Who are you? Get the hell outta here.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.396
Excuse me, kid.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.940
Possible concussion.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.233
-Come on.
-Get off me.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.735
-You wanna go to jail?
-You'll be going to jail

03:13.818 --> 03:14.819
for criminal negligence.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.865
This man has
a fracture-dislocation of the hip

03:18.948 --> 03:20.617
and he's gonna lose his leg
unless I fix it right away.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.493
Hold his hips down
so I can rotate his leg.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.411
What?

03:23.494 --> 03:24.913
There's no palpable pulse in his leg,

03:24.996 --> 03:26.539
and he's gonna lose it
because of blocked circulation.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.125
-I'm not gonna...
-Hold him down now.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.169
And you, support his neck.

03:32.879 --> 03:33.838
Ready?

03:35.173 --> 03:38.051
Hold him steady, okay? Here we go.

03:49.812 --> 03:50.688
I can feel pulses.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.731
Circulation is restored.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.316
Now, get me something
I can use as a brace.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.234
-Yes, doc.
-Go.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.570
And something we can use to put pressure
on this wound to stop the bleeding.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.121
You owe me a scrunchie.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.373
Who is this kid?

04:09.207 --> 04:10.541
My daughter.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.043
A doctor.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.628
Sure.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.248
-That's so weird.
-Girl, you get your greens too.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.165
It's great.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.042
Hello, Mr. Lim.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.253
I'm Dr. Nakayama and this is Dr. Zeller.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.754
Hi. We're both residents.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.007
Dr. Kamealoha will be taking care of you.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.258
Aloha, Mr. Lim.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.471
Is this some kind of practical joke?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.890
She may be 16, but she is a doctor.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.350
You know who she's like?

05:09.434 --> 05:10.560
Here we go.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.936
Remember <i>Doogie Howser?</i>

05:12.020 --> 05:13.354
That show from the '90s?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.773
She's like a real-life, Doogie Howser.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.233
That's why we call her Doogie.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.110
Oh, I never made the connection.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.695
Girl, why did you think
we called her Doogie?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.613
She is every Asian mom's dream.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.614
I mean, to them,

05:23.698 --> 05:26.826
the only thing better than being a doctor
is being a doctor faster.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.828
Like, some moms like to brag
about their kids being doctors,

05:28.911 --> 05:31.372
but they're like 27... losers.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.292
Is the wound anesthetized,

05:34.375 --> 05:36.127
-cleaned, irrigated?
-Yes, doctor.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.545
Great. Mr. Lim,
if you could just hold still.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.631
You'll be holding still for a lawsuit
in federal court.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.425
Only 16 years old?

05:42.508 --> 05:45.553
I’ll add a count for infliction
of emotional distress.

05:45.636 --> 05:46.971
I'm sorry you feel that way, sir.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.097
I can tell you're an attorney,

05:48.181 --> 05:50.141
so you must know that there's no duty
owed by the hospital

05:50.224 --> 05:51.934
with respect to the age of its doctors.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.646
Nor is there any proximate cause
connecting my age to the harm suffered.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.441
And even if you could make out
a prima facie case of negligence,

05:58.524 --> 06:00.276
you do not have the diversity
of jurisdiction

06:00.360 --> 06:02.070
to get this into federal court.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.946
Besides which, I am done.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.532
-You're done?
-Nice and neat.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.742
Shouldn't be much of a scar.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.912
Maybe I won't sue.

06:10.995 --> 06:11.871
Well, if you change your mind,

06:11.954 --> 06:14.665
the statute of limitations for malpractice
is actually three years.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.335
I thought about going to law school
when I was nine,

06:17.418 --> 06:19.045
but then I got really into Rainbow Loom.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.382
Thanks... Doogie.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.926
Residents, I need your patient reports.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.804
And Dr. Kamealoha,
may I have a word with you?

06:28.971 --> 06:30.681
Yes, doctor.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.560
Last time she said that to me,
I legit threw up in my mouth.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.520
I know, right?

06:35.603 --> 06:38.272
She sent me an email once,
and I had to open it with my therapist.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.190
Hey.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.443
Is everything okay, doctor?

06:42.527 --> 06:45.405
It was, until this morning
when I saw your new TikTok.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.406
Mom.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.408
We're at work, it's Dr. Hannon.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.869
And I know it's your birthday,
but that was way too much hip action.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.080
-A dab will do you.
-I was dancing.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.331
-So much hip.
-Okay.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.458
So I have to call your doctor
because we're at work,

06:57.542 --> 07:00.086
but you're allowed to mom out on me
because I do this.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.506
Oh, no. Stop that.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.715
Stop!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.050
Sorry, I got moves and you don't.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.885
I got moves.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.680
There is no beat I can't get jiggy wit.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.724
See the hip, subtle.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.937
So this is fine.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.857
But I go full Magic Mike
at the Halloween office party,

07:20.940 --> 07:24.402
and suddenly, it's a "problem"
that needs to be "addressed"?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.571
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.574
Is there anything else, Dr. Hannon?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.033
Wait. You got a little something
right under...

07:31.117 --> 07:33.077
Ew, Mom. Gross.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.829
Well, are you hungry?

07:34.912 --> 07:37.582
'Cause Dad's got his
shave ice truck here today,

07:37.665 --> 07:40.460
or there's almonds in my desk drawer.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.504
Okay. I love you, doctor...

07:47.091 --> 07:47.925
BENNY'S
SHAVE ICE AND FLOWERS

07:48.009 --> 07:49.010
Here you go.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.846
The rainbow shave ice
and two <i>plumeria lei.</i>

07:51.929 --> 07:54.348
-Mahalo!
-Mahalo.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.516
This is so neat.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.143
How’d you come up with this?

07:57.226 --> 07:59.228
I’ve never heard
of a shave ice-flower truck.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.229
The truck chose me.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.107
Say, I used to work in finance,
but I wanted more out of life.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.736
So, I said,
what are the two things I love most?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.863
It’s shave ice and flowers.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.156
So here we are.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.493
Well, I love Shih Tzus
and my nephew Kevin.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.660
Is there anything in that?

08:15.244 --> 08:17.413
Seems like a tough truck,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.582
but if you put your heart in it,
anything's possible.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.792
-Hey, honey.
-Hey!

08:24.378 --> 08:25.880
I know that face.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.798
The "I'm not fine, no matter how much
I say I'm fine" face.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.467
I'm fine.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.386
It's just... me and Lahela
got into it again.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.723
She keeps pulling away from me.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.350
Do you think I should be worried
about her?

08:37.433 --> 08:39.519
You shouldn't worry about her.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.770
Or our other two.

08:40.853 --> 08:44.065
You know. Straight C's
and only eats pizza bagels.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.401
Hey, guys. How was school today?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.195
It's great! I got a C in math,

08:49.278 --> 08:51.822
which the teacher says
is the median score.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.826
And I ate a pizza bagel
for breakfast and lunch.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.620
See? Everybody's doing great.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.038
Hey, remember, we're celebrating

08:59.121 --> 09:00.331
-Lahela's birthday tonight.
-Right.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.542
I got her a midnight musk body spray.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.460
I figured we could share.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.088
I don't want to brag,
but puberty is coming for me.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.925
Stuff is happening, guys. Wanna hear more?

09:11.008 --> 09:12.009
-No.
-No.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.888
You know, the self-portrait you did
in art class really told the full story.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.772
Morning, Will.

09:24.855 --> 09:25.940
Hey, Doogie!

09:26.023 --> 09:28.901
You know, you are the only person
who's allowed to call me that.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.529
I like what you've done with the place.

09:31.612 --> 09:37.034
Yeah. My daughter came and did all this
to try to lift my spirits.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.744
-Groovy?
-Yeah.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.162
You like this song?

09:41.289 --> 09:42.623
I don't think I know this one.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.959
No? It's a classic.

09:46.210 --> 09:50.089
When I was your age,
I snuck out to see Creedence live.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.133
The first concert I'd ever been to.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.427
And it's first time
I ever danced with a woman.

09:55.636 --> 10:00.391
And it's the first time that I ever...
I tried a few other things.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.479
You never forget a night of firsts.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.440
I want a night like that.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.150
Are you kidding me?

10:09.233 --> 10:10.109
You're young.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.737
Your whole life
is gonna be nights like that.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.075
Will, you are so popular,

10:18.159 --> 10:20.161
this whole team of doctors
wanted to see you.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.162
This is Dr. Lee.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.039
He's the heart surgeon
I was telling you about.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.958
Will, I hear you're not feeling too well.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.545
But not to worry, we're going
to make you feel much better.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.505
We might even give you a new heart.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.385
What do you say to that?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.680
I worry.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.391
Well, there are risks.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.562
And given your age,
complications to consider,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.648
but Dr. Lee is an expert

10:48.731 --> 10:51.651
and he's gonna fix you up
so we can get a really sick guy in here.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.860
Right, Dr. Lee?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.236
Definitely.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.030
<i>A transplant?</i>

10:56.113 --> 10:57.698
We never discussed a transplant.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.617
I know he's got severe AS

10:59.700 --> 11:02.036
and he's been in class four failure
for a long time.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.246
But we should start with TAVR,
and go from there.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.665
A transplant is too risky.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.041
Not according to these labs.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.586
Statistically, he's got a better chance
if we replace the valve,

11:10.670 --> 11:12.296
then probably a bive pacer.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.299
I know I can get his EF
above 20 percent in two months.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.803
Look, my recommendation
is to do the transplant, okay?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.471
Does my call stand or not?

11:22.473 --> 11:23.724
It's a tough call.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.896
But Dr. Kamealoha,
I'm not sure we have the time to wait.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.981
So, yes, Dr. Lee, your call stands.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.443
He is my patient and I know what he needs.

11:35.945 --> 11:36.821
Lahela!

11:39.073 --> 11:40.658
You just gonna take that?

11:40.741 --> 11:42.410
Man, I wish I had a white mom.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.370
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.012
Good news.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.389
I caught dinner.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.473
Yum!

12:04.557 --> 12:06.350
I'm gonna throw it in the washing machine
to tenderize it.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.476
-Okay.
-Dad?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.477
Yeah?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.439
Kids at school think it's weird
that we have a separate washing machine

12:11.522 --> 12:13.023
just to tenderize octopus.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.942
I think it's weird they don't have one.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.656
Hey, guys. Dr. Kamealoha here
with an update.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.783
Today is my 16th birthday,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.035
and I think I might be coming down
with something.

12:25.119 --> 12:30.499
My symptoms are sweaty palms,
stomach pangs, slight heart palpitations.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.253
Yeah, I got a case of going
to the dance with a hottie.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.756
Happy birthday!

12:36.839 --> 12:38.132
Jeez, Steph.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.426
I like to make an entrance.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.678
You should ask my mom
what happened when I was born.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.680
I got my driver's license.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.598
Yes!

12:45.681 --> 12:48.142
And tomorrow night at the dance
will be my first date with Walter.

12:48.225 --> 12:51.145
Hey, do you think there's
any world your brother Kai

12:51.228 --> 12:52.229
would go to the dance with me?

12:52.313 --> 12:55.566
Steph, we've been over this.
You're his little sister's best friend.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.359
I mean, he's known you
since we were toddlers.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.987
I just don't think he sees you
as dating material.

13:00.070 --> 13:00.988
So there's a chance?

13:02.656 --> 13:05.326
Now, all I need is for my mom
to extend my curfew.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.286
She says nothing good
ever happens after 11:00,

13:07.369 --> 13:09.371
and I cannot wait
to find out what that is.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.540
My mom always says,
"Careful where you get your tattoos

13:11.624 --> 13:13.709
in case they get stretched out
when you have a baby."

13:16.045 --> 13:17.129
Yes.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.090
-That octopus was delicious.
-So good.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.843
Thanks. I set the washer to heavy load.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.179
Okay, look. So here's the thing.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.974
I have the dance tomorrow night
with Walter.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.937
And I was hoping we could push my curfew,
just this one time.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.439
I think 11:00 is pretty reasonable.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.819
Okay. But everyone goes to Zippy's after,
and I really wanna hang out.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.321
Isn't that what you do at the dance?

13:42.404 --> 13:44.406
No, the real thing
is the thing after the thing.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.200
-Please.
-Honey. I'm sorry,

13:46.283 --> 13:47.952
but you have work the next day.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.246
Please?

13:51.038 --> 13:51.872
Hey, guys.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.083
Sorry. Are you guys eating dinner at 6:45,

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
the same exact time
you eat dinner every night?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.003
I'd hate to interrupt.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.172
Steph, get over here.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.095
Hey, Kai.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.265
How's it going?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.726
Are you, like,
going to the dance on Friday?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.564
-I want to.
-Really?

14:16.647 --> 14:18.566
Yeah, but just with some friends.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.692
Seems more fun that way.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.153
Totally.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.363
I wish I could go to the dance.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.699
Find a high school girl and ask her.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.827
Stephanie Marie Denesco...

14:29.910 --> 14:31.412
Don't even think about it, Paw Patrol.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.372
Yeah. Save that energy
for the monkey bars.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.250
Joke's on you. I can't lift my own weight.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.960
Don't worry, son. We'll work on that.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.087
Boys, you wanna come help me?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.255
Yeah.

14:42.006 --> 14:42.965
Plates.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.886
Thank you.

14:46.969 --> 14:47.970
Okay, Mom.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.931
Please, just this one night.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
It is a birthday present.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.101
Let me stay out a little later.

14:54.184 --> 14:58.022
Look. I'm sorry. I know you're excited
about the dance, but I'm afraid not.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.483
-I will...
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:06.822
<i>-Happy birthday, dear Lahela
-Happy birthday, dear Lahela</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:11.035
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

15:16.248 --> 15:17.333
Make a wish.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.626
What's the point?

15:18.709 --> 15:19.835
Clara here already said no.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.670
Hey, I'm your mother.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.297
So, now you're my mother.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.008
A second ago, you were my boss.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.051
Which one is it?

15:27.134 --> 15:30.471
Because you don't get to control
my entire life.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.646
BENNY'S
SHAVE ICE AND FLOWERS

15:38.729 --> 15:40.564
-Hey, Benny. What's up?
-Hey.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.608
Can I get a cherry icy, please?

15:42.691 --> 15:45.611
Bruh, I'm a local boy. I sell shave ice.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.612
Sorry, Benny.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.613
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.032
At lunch, he ordered a Pokemon bowl.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.201
He also thought
Aloha Spirit was an airline.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.911
He doesn't know when to <i>shaka</i> either.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.747
Like today, he gave this poor family
in the recovery room false hope.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.124
Okay. So, I have some learning to do.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.502
<i>-Shaka.</i>
-Aloha.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.087
Hey, Noelani! How's it going, Charles?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.546
Well, you know. As Oprah says,

16:04.630 --> 16:07.549
"the biggest adventure you can take
in this life is to live your dream..."

16:07.633 --> 16:09.510
I guess we're done here. That was fun.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.806
Hey. I know you're still worried
about Lahela.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.933
So, I've brought you a little something
to cheer you up.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.394
Honey, that is so sweet!

16:19.561 --> 16:22.523
It's impossible to work with Lahela
and be her mom.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.777
I'm worried... she can't stand me.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.445
What are you talking about?
You guys just made that TikTok.

16:28.529 --> 16:34.535
@dr.kamealoha

16:34.618 --> 16:36.203
That was months ago.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.372
And she made me be a basketball.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.710
I just want to know she's okay.
But she shuts me out.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.129
No. I think she just needs
a little freedom.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.715
You know. Room to make mistakes,
like all teenagers.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.092
But that's what makes this so hard.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.053
She's not just a teenager, she's a doctor.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.556
Making a mistake in a high school
is one thing.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.725
In a hospital, it's life and death.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.728
I'm just trying to protect her.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.396
You know what I think you need?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.565
To get in the ocean.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.359
I'm an Irish-Catholic woman
from Philly, okay?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.194
That's not how we do things.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.906
Feel guilty, pound a 40,
punch a Giants fan.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.366
That's how we roll.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.660
You and Lahela take care
of everybody at the hospital.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.038
But it's my job to take care
of both of you.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.541
I really think you could use a swim.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.793
Feel the sun on your face.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.211
Salt water on your skin.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.629
I'm working.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.466
Wait, where are you going?

17:31.341 --> 17:33.802
The ocean. I talk myself into it.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.137
Besides, it's right over there.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.389
What are we doing just sitting here?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.183
Come on.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.225
Well, have fun.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.351
Love you!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.442
Hey, Will. How are you?

17:48.525 --> 17:49.777
Oh, hey, Doogie!

17:49.860 --> 17:51.361
Come on in, grab a seat.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.952
What's wrong?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.121
Nothing.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.499
Come on, talk to me. You can tell me.

18:06.835 --> 18:12.257
I just... feel so ready for everything.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.469
But I have my first dance tonight.

18:15.552 --> 18:19.056
And I'm not allowed
to hang out afterwards.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.393
I just wanna be free.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.815
Got just the thing.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.650
-Here. Take this.
-No.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.276
-I couldn't. I...
-Come on. Take it.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.446
My garbage son-in-law
gave it to me for Christmas.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.656
It's a CD.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.116
You know what a CD is?

18:37.199 --> 18:38.742
I do.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.620
I think I have a Doc McStuffins
boom box somewhere.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.414
Well, you just put that out,
when you need a little pick me up.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.666
Trust me, it'll help.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.834
Thanks.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.171
So are you ready for your new heart?

18:52.506 --> 18:54.216
When do I get it?

18:54.299 --> 18:57.052
The transplant schedule
is hard to predict.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.389
It could be today, tomorrow, next week.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.099
Depends on when they get one.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.145
Hey, it's okay.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.148
Will you be there when I get it?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.567
Yes, absolutely.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.651
They will call me.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.112
No matter what,
no matter when, I will be there.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.614
-Promise?
-I promise.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.950
Okay.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.828
Come on, get out of here.
You got a dance to get to.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.747
Some lucky prince charming awaits.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.274
Walter, you look so nice.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.567
Thank you, Dr. Hannon.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.988
Mr. Kamealoha, this is for you.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.157
Lahela said it was your favorite.

20:04.411 --> 20:08.165
It looks like it doesn't expire
for, well, ever.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.710
Gives me some time to make my spam musubi.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.462
That's very sweet, Walter.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.673
When Benny met my dad,
he brought him scrapple.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.052
It's the Spam of Pennsylvania.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.303
Okay.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.055
I'll just, I'll go check on her.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.264
Okay.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.312
Hey.

20:31.855 --> 20:32.940
Hi.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.571
You look...

20:41.240 --> 20:42.491
You look beautiful.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.911
Thanks, so do you.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.371
Oh, thanks.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.338
Here you go.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.350
I catch octopus with my bare hands.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.478
Imagine what I could do to something
with only two arms.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.273
What a pretty!

21:14.356 --> 21:16.191
-Who is that?
-I think I know.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.902
Aloha! We are Walter's aunties.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.362
His mommy had to work tonight,

21:20.445 --> 21:23.198
but we have promised
we are going to take plenty pictures!

21:23.282 --> 21:25.158
Come on in.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.332
Aloha!

21:32.416 --> 21:34.084
-Aloha!
-Aloha!

21:34.167 --> 21:37.129
We gonna need a lot more Spam.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.006
Say "cheese."

21:41.508 --> 21:44.011
At some point, this will stop, right?

21:45.095 --> 21:46.388
I don't know.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.557
They just sent Uncle Shack on a Costco
run.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.100
Have fun, you two.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.602
We will... until 11:00.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.231
-Bye, guys.
-No! Wait.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.234
I want a picture of you too
before you go to the dance.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.028
Okay. Just me?

22:01.111 --> 22:02.529
-Yeah. Right there.
-Excuse me.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.114
Sorry.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.576
Hey, guys.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.578
Are you taking photos before the dance?

22:09.661 --> 22:11.747
Crazy. I happen upon you,
right at this moment,

22:11.830 --> 22:15.125
with my Nikon D500 camera
and totally empty memory card.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.501
What a coincidence!

22:16.585 --> 22:18.253
Steph, get in there!

22:18.337 --> 22:19.212
Let it rip, B dawg.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.213
You got it.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.259
Hey, Kai!

22:24.343 --> 22:25.802
I've been thinking
about my carbon footprint,

22:25.886 --> 22:27.512
and ways to save the planet.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.681
And something small that we could do
is go to the dance together

22:29.765 --> 22:32.559
because you know... the environment.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.023
Sure!

22:41.026 --> 22:42.444
It's happening!

22:42.527 --> 22:45.113
I got to apologize ahead of time
for frontal grinding with your brother.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.454
The plot thickens
in this love triangle of ours.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.635
I'm just trying to get some punch.

23:14.893 --> 23:15.977
It's all shoulders.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.604
Oh, it's all in the shoulders?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.366
I guess, we should...

23:37.249 --> 23:38.959
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.253
Of course.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.504
I'm having a great time.

23:45.424 --> 23:50.637
This is my first dance
with, like, a... date.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.389
Me, too.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.015
Really?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.434
Yeah.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.770
It's a night of firsts.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.282
I'm sorry.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.871
It's the hospital. I have to call in.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.123
Okay.

24:18.206 --> 24:19.124
Right now?

24:19.708 --> 24:20.750
Sorry.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.807
No.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.731
What happened?

24:45.984 --> 24:50.489
He was asleep in his bed,
when he suddenly went to V-fib arrest.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.326
We worked on him for over an hour, but...

24:55.285 --> 24:58.246
he was just... too debilitated.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.636
Hey.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.059
I'm sorry...

25:20.477 --> 25:22.062
Dr. Kamealoha.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.580
Lahela!

25:41.873 --> 25:43.416
I came as soon as I heard.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.338
So sorry.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.757
Honey, I'm so sorry.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.301
I'm so sorry.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.346
It's okay.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.641
It's okay.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.656
You were right.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.157
He was really weakened.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.868
But Dr. Lee was right too.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.955
His best chance was a new heart.

26:22.038 --> 26:25.542
Unfortunately, his time came
before we could get him one.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.211
As hard as we try,

26:28.295 --> 26:32.424
sometimes, it just doesn't work out
the way we want it to.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.968
I really thought I could make him better.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.515
I wanted to help him.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.183
And you did.

26:44.894 --> 26:48.523
I saw how he lit up
whenever you came into the room.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.151
We were buddies.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.612
No.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.196
You were his doctor.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.824
The one he trusted.

26:57.907 --> 27:00.952
The one he knew was looking out for him.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.582
Well, a lot of good that did him.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.542
Look at me.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.426
You are an extraordinary doctor.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.138
You're just saying that
'cause you're my mom.

27:20.221 --> 27:23.141
No, I'm saying it because it's true.

27:23.224 --> 27:26.394
And I know that because I'm your boss.

27:29.689 --> 27:34.069
The first patient I lost
was a 52-year-old male.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.278
Heart attack.

27:35.862 --> 27:38.990
An hour before he came into the ER,

27:39.074 --> 27:41.910
he was at home making dinner
with his wife.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.831
I just couldn't accept
that it could have happened so fast.

27:46.915 --> 27:50.752
So, I kept giving him CPR.

27:50.835 --> 27:54.756
Thinking that if I just tried harder,
then I could make him wake up.

27:55.882 --> 28:01.262
Finally, after an hour,
they had to pull me off him.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.434
Weren't you worried his brain
had gone too long without oxygen?

28:07.268 --> 28:08.353
Of course.

28:09.020 --> 28:14.317
But the thought of giving up on him,
I couldn't do it.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.862
I'll never forget. I...

28:19.114 --> 28:20.907
I walked out of the ER,

28:20.990 --> 28:26.705
and I saw someone...
buying pretzels at a vending machine.

28:26.788 --> 28:31.334
And I wanted to scream, you know?

28:31.418 --> 28:37.048
'Cause, how could anybody
be eating pretzels right now?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.804
I'm sorry.

28:46.015 --> 28:49.686
It's too bad your mom's not a doctor,
and she couldn't be there for you.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.196
That's all I want.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.699
To be there for you. To know you're okay.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.870
You can talk to me about anything.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.705
Thanks, Mom.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.917
Mom?

29:14.294 --> 29:15.503
What is it, honey?

29:16.838 --> 29:18.715
Could I be alone for a minute?

29:21.301 --> 29:22.302
Yeah.

29:45.950 --> 29:46.910
And when that happens...

29:46.993 --> 29:48.745
I would swipe right every...

30:20.443 --> 30:22.487
I just wanna know she's okay.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.200
I wanna know you're okay.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.665
When I look at pictures of your
high school friends shoveling snow,

30:33.748 --> 30:35.458
I feel good about your choices.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.003
I got a better idea.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.590
Let's get in the ocean.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.302
Now, we're talking.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.140
Lahela!

30:52.100 --> 30:53.768
Walter. Hey!

30:53.852 --> 30:54.811
How is it?

30:56.062 --> 30:57.230
How was Zippy's?

30:57.313 --> 31:00.567
There were like 12 of us at one table
and we only ordered two coffees,

31:00.650 --> 31:02.318
so I kinda felt bad for the waitress.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.072
But then we saw two teachers there
on a date, so we left.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.243
I'm sorry that I had to bail on the dance.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.664
No worries. I know you had to run off
and save lives...

31:14.747 --> 31:15.582
How did it go?

31:25.550 --> 31:26.759
Lahela, what is it?

31:29.220 --> 31:30.138
You can talk to me.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.297
She's okay.

A good friend once told me,
you never forget your firsts.

32:49.884 --> 32:53.346
The first time you kiss someone
and feel a spark.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.310
The first time you lose someone
you really care about.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.565
The first time you see your bestie
frontal grind on your brother.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.527
Definitely never forgetting that one,
no matter how much I want to.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.322
But it's true.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.909
I'm never going to forget these firsts.
