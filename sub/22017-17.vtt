00:01.050 --> 00:02.259
<i>Previously on</i> Star...

00:02.260 --> 00:03.496
Principal Sportswear
just called.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.576
They're looking for somebody
for their new ad campaign.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.048
<i>Now, I find the next big
thing, I make my name.</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.600
I'm-a go old school
like back in the day.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.060
Or you could just look
right under your nose.

00:13.590 --> 00:16.260
Let's get the hell out of here.
I said move, boy.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.630
Sponsor called.

00:19.670 --> 00:21.230
So they're ready
to make an offer?

00:21.270 --> 00:22.320
Well, actually, they did.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.416
<i>Yeah, well, you know, Alex,</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.140
she's making a name for herself.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.559
<i>The question is, what
are you gonna do</i>

00:27.560 --> 00:28.580
<i>to stand out?</i>

00:28.600 --> 00:30.540
- Am I gonna die?
- I'm not gonna let you die.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.509
You drinking again?
This is the reason

00:32.549 --> 00:34.659
Sound House was hesitant to work
with you in the first place.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.810
- Are you Angel Rivera?
- What is it?

00:36.850 --> 00:38.030
It's a letter from Immigration.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.050
They denied my DACA application.

00:41.060 --> 00:42.060
Alex, Alex.

00:42.061 --> 00:43.240
- Alex.
- Right here.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.359
Alex, what do you think
about the <i> Scoopish</i> article?

00:45.360 --> 00:46.459
So, Alex don't got time

00:46.460 --> 00:47.690
to show up to our
studio session,

00:47.700 --> 00:49.490
but she has time to
talk to the paparazzi?

00:49.630 --> 00:51.700
Wow, what did Alex do now?

00:51.740 --> 00:52.830
How do you feel

00:52.870 --> 00:55.110
about Noah and Star's new duet?
Any beef between you two?

00:55.140 --> 00:58.400
There's no beef. It was cute.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.760
Cute? I got your cute.

01:01.780 --> 01:02.919
What I want you all to focus on

01:02.920 --> 01:04.180
is my new solo track.

01:04.209 --> 01:05.239
I'm gonna collab

01:05.239 --> 01:06.990
- with a dope-ass producer.
- Solo track?

01:07.010 --> 01:09.410
So, without Take Three? The
other girls mad at you?

01:09.450 --> 01:11.180
What solo song? Do
you know about this?

01:11.220 --> 01:13.166
When's the last time you
talked with Noah? Alex...

01:13.190 --> 01:14.350
Simone.

01:14.390 --> 01:15.920
What's wrong with you?

01:16.520 --> 01:19.160
Why are you paying attention
to that mess, anyway?

01:19.190 --> 01:21.390
Don't we got
something to record?

01:22.360 --> 01:24.600
I can't believe you don't care.

01:24.630 --> 01:27.320
But I didn't come all this
way to be Alex's come-up.

back at the helm.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.750
Thank you, Jeff.

01:43.780 --> 01:45.780
It's been a struggle

01:45.820 --> 01:48.690
in the face of my father's
never-ending publicity storm.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.620
But I'm primed to
elevate this label.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.990
And you believe that, uh,
Noah Brooks can do that, huh?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.330
We're halfway there.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.160
Sound House has asked
to hear his album,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.630
and a national tour's
around the corner.

01:59.630 --> 02:01.570
They haven't come on board yet?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.179
Don't worry. They'll
come on board.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.280
Noah has to charm the
hell out of Sound House.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.540

I'm gonna tear it up.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.610
Yeah, right.

03:22.650 --> 03:24.780
- Go ahead, take it.
- That don't matter now.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.530
Angel, look, I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

03:26.550 --> 03:28.620
- I'm being deported.
- Wait, what?

03:28.650 --> 03:29.790
- Yeah.
- No, look,

03:29.820 --> 03:31.190
I got to help you
figure this out.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.699
No. You sound like
a broken record.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.760
You can't help nobody.

03:33.790 --> 03:35.260
You can't even help
your damn self.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.130
My dad was right about
you this whole time.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.400
You know what? I've always
loved you like a son, nephew.

03:39.430 --> 03:42.370
All I ever wanted to do was
help you and your mother.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.770
Don't bring Mom into this.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.540

04:09.930 --> 04:12.500
You really backed
up the money truck.

04:12.530 --> 04:15.930
I'm putting every resource
Midtown has behind Noah.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.940
- He deserves it.
- Well, it feels good

04:17.970 --> 04:19.670
to finally be on the same side.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.560
I know how instrumental you were

04:21.579 --> 04:23.099
in helping Noah get
through his demons

04:23.100 --> 04:25.600
to finish this album.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.800
Thank you. I owe you.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.950
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

04:29.980 --> 04:32.460
Take Three also made
a lot of sacrifices

04:32.480 --> 04:34.150
of their own to help
Noah get here, too.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.290
Clearly they ain't just
talent show winners anymore.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.190
They got hits, radio
play, growing fan base.

04:40.230 --> 04:43.530
Where's this going, Carlotta?

04:44.160 --> 04:47.130
I'd like you to revisit the
terms of their contract.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.370
Let 'em know how valuable
they are at this label.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.670
I'll give them an
album release date.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.410
It's a good start.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.620
But I know you can
do better than that.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.100
What are your demands?

04:58.160 --> 04:59.200
How much time you got?

05:00.650 --> 05:02.650
Okay, first of all,

05:02.680 --> 05:05.880
our budget is a third less
than any other breakout artist

05:05.920 --> 05:07.120
on any other label.

05:07.150 --> 05:08.790
I've done my research.

05:08.820 --> 05:11.640
It takes money to
make money, Ayanna.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.500
Set up a meeting with my team.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.279
I see

05:18.280 --> 05:21.100
your girls aren't the only
ones stepping up their game.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.200
- How was that?
- Amazing.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.240
You're amazing.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.410
No, Noah,

05:30.440 --> 05:31.940
I have not forgotten.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.150
I will be at the listening
party right by your side.

05:34.180 --> 05:35.780
I promise.

05:35.820 --> 05:37.150
Okay. Okay, bye.

05:37.180 --> 05:38.240
Welcome.

05:38.420 --> 05:41.050
This recording session
started 45 minutes ago.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.170
And how much of my part did
you sing while I was away?

05:43.190 --> 05:45.160
Do you care? I heard
you were going solo.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.420
- Can y'all stop, please?
- Listen up.

05:47.460 --> 05:48.499
Good news.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.679
I finally got Ayanna

05:50.680 --> 05:52.380
to give us an album
release date.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.830
Plus, I got her to
open up your contract

05:54.870 --> 05:56.230
so we can renegotiate.

05:56.270 --> 05:59.180
So now is the time
to be really clear

05:59.260 --> 06:00.570
about what we want.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.610
Easy. I want a guarantee

06:02.680 --> 06:04.880
that I can do projects
outside of Take Three.

06:06.310 --> 06:07.950
You're already doing that.

06:07.980 --> 06:10.480
Yeah, but maybe we
should get it on paper

06:10.520 --> 06:12.380
so you can stop
acting like a bitch

06:12.400 --> 06:14.040
every time I'm given
an opportunity.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.500
Maybe you should decide once
and for all if you're here

06:16.520 --> 06:18.300
for Alexandra Crane
or Take Three.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.960
'Cause if it's not Take
Three, why are you here?

06:20.990 --> 06:22.380
This is not about you or you.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.660
I'm in there

06:23.700 --> 06:25.360
fighting for an entire group.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.520
You know, it sure as hell
don't feel like one, Miss C.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.280
You know what?

06:31.740 --> 06:33.300
I think I'm done.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.670
I think I'm really
done with Take Three.

in our contract, Miss C?

07:05.440 --> 07:07.119
No, Simone, that
wouldn't even work.

group thing go?

07:14.880 --> 07:17.010
How can you say that
so easily, Simone?

07:17.050 --> 07:19.899
Maybe you need to stop
overreacting to every damn thing

07:19.900 --> 07:21.030
that happens in this group.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.290
Oh, please.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.736
Coming from you, that
sounds ridiculous.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.920
Okay, you know what?

07:24.960 --> 07:26.860
This is not my dream.
This is your dream.

07:26.890 --> 07:29.030

to work this out.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.800
You do what the hell
you want to do.

07:31.830 --> 07:34.400
I'm-a be at the
hospital with Cotton.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.210
We got some good news from UNOS.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.780
- Yeah?
- Jayden got a kidney?

07:49.820 --> 07:51.850
Not yet. But he has
been officially added

07:51.880 --> 07:53.380
to the list as a priority.

07:53.420 --> 07:55.820
"Priority." That means,
like, in a couple of days?

07:55.860 --> 07:57.390
It's gonna be a few
weeks at least.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.840
What if he doesn't
have a few weeks?

08:01.860 --> 08:03.330
Jayden has to wait

08:03.360 --> 08:05.460
for a matching donor organ
to become available.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.810
But you said he
needs a transplant

08:06.830 --> 08:08.830
- as soon as possible.
- I'm sorry.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.130
But without a match available,

08:10.170 --> 08:12.120
there's not much we
can do besides wait.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.300
- What's up?
- Simone wants to leave the group.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.920
Alex is acting
like Roland Crane.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.166
I don't know what to do anymore.

08:29.190 --> 08:30.890
It sounds like Alex is doing

08:30.920 --> 08:32.720
exactly what I told
you she would.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.330
The brands, the features.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.239
She's been positioning herself

08:36.240 --> 08:38.100
as a solo artist
for a while now.

08:38.130 --> 08:39.929
Question is, why aren't you?

08:39.970 --> 08:41.780
Look, I know you're trying
to make me go solo.

08:41.799 --> 08:42.900
It's not just me.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.440
It's right in your damn face.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.270
We got some traction
on this article

08:46.310 --> 08:47.640
we leaked on <i> Scoopish.</i>

08:47.670 --> 08:49.110
Now, you can either run with it

08:49.140 --> 08:50.470
or continue to sit back

08:50.510 --> 08:52.400
and watch Alex make
her way to the top.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.580
This track is all you.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.159
Trust me, you sing on this,

09:01.160 --> 09:03.700
you're gonna give Alex and
Jackson a run for their money.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.930
Jackson?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.440
That's who Alex
been working with?

09:14.260 --> 09:15.700
Okay.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.080
Cassie.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.080
Listen, why you calling
me 90,000 times if I...

09:31.320 --> 09:33.220
I'm not dodging you.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.450
Ca... I appreciate everything
you've done for me, okay?

09:36.490 --> 09:38.890
I'm just not with that life.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
Cassie?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.680
Cassie, Carlotta's sister?

09:43.060 --> 09:44.660
Man, where the hell
you popping up from?

09:44.700 --> 09:45.910
Damn, boy. You know
you're dancing

09:45.930 --> 09:47.010
with the devil there, right?

09:47.030 --> 09:48.146
You know we fired you, right?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.719
- She's no one to play with.
- Keep my business

09:49.720 --> 09:51.400
out your mouth. Can
you do that for me?

09:51.420 --> 09:52.940
What y'all beefing about now?

09:53.010 --> 09:54.160
Oh, nothing.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.470
Just checking in on my guy here.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.640
Just remember he means well.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.410
I mean well.

10:00.450 --> 10:02.810
Look, I'm just trying
to tie up loose ends.

10:02.850 --> 10:06.180
Jahil, I don't care what
you're here to tie up.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.040
We've had to start everything
over because of you.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.636
Do you understand, ever
since you came around,

10:09.660 --> 10:11.570
- you've ruined everything, all right?
- Look out!

10:11.590 --> 10:13.360
Andy, get down!

10:22.280 --> 10:23.830
You okay?

10:23.870 --> 10:25.200
You okay?

10:25.670 --> 10:26.720
Stay down, just-just stay down.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.269
- Stay down, okay?
- I'm good.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.279
Lottie, I'm good.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.040
Andy, are you good?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.390
- Stay down, stay down.
- I'm-I'm good.

10:32.410 --> 10:33.410
Get me a blanket.

10:33.450 --> 10:34.880
Can somebody call an ambulance?

10:34.910 --> 10:35.910
Come on.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.380
- Okay.
- 911...

10:37.420 --> 10:39.030
- I-I can get up, I-I'm o...
- You good. You good.

10:39.050 --> 10:40.730
- You good. You good. You good.
- I know, I'm good.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.920
Put some pressure on this.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.236
- I'm all right.
- Stay down, baby.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.760
Stay down, baby. You okay, baby.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.900
All them bullets, and
I just got grazed.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.846
You sure you don't want
to have this looked at?

10:53.870 --> 10:56.500
Come on, girl. You
know I got nine lives.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.040
All right.

10:58.070 --> 10:59.870
Hold that there.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.870
So...

11:01.910 --> 11:05.040
who's trying to kill you now?
Maggie?

11:05.080 --> 11:07.050
It don't matter.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.850
They didn't kill me.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.850
Yeah, well, they might have.

11:16.220 --> 11:17.760
Yeah.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.360
Yeah, that should do it.

11:19.390 --> 11:21.030

You're just giving

12:21.120 --> 12:24.590
Yeah, well, music wasn't
really my dream, you know?

12:24.630 --> 12:26.490
I did it for Star.

12:26.530 --> 12:29.360
Yeah, but somewhere along the
way, you fell in love with it.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.360
No.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.800
I fell in love with you.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.440
Yeah?

12:38.470 --> 12:39.970
Mm-hmm.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.110
I realized there's more to
life than chasing fame.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.140
You know?

12:45.180 --> 12:47.220
That ain't me.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.020
Angel, let's get out of here.

12:58.060 --> 13:01.260
What do you mean? Run away?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.320
I got Immigration on my back.

13:03.340 --> 13:04.719
Well, not if they
can't find you.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.720
Okay, you're crazy.

13:05.721 --> 13:07.230
I'm serious.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.920
Are you in or not?

13:11.070 --> 13:12.970
When are we leaving, Bonnie?

13:14.200 --> 13:17.180
As soon as you can
pack your bag, Clyde.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.220
Ooh!

13:23.350 --> 13:24.950
Big ballin', huh?

13:24.990 --> 13:27.020
Heard you and Selena
are moving out.

13:27.050 --> 13:29.150
Is my grandma telling everybody?

13:29.190 --> 13:32.920
Your Big Mama used to be
the neighborhood gossip

13:32.960 --> 13:34.500
and the neighborhood watch, too.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.759
But it looks like we need

13:35.760 --> 13:37.106
a little bit more of
that around here.

13:37.130 --> 13:40.170
I know that's right. I mean,
I've been putting up flyers,

13:40.200 --> 13:41.470
- talking to folks.
- I know,

13:41.500 --> 13:43.500
but I wish we could do
something more permanent.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.679
Help folks on parole
get some jobs.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.710
You know, get people off the streets.
If you down.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.310
No, I'm down. I'm always trying
to be a part of the solution.

13:51.350 --> 13:54.350
So whatever the
hustle is, I'm in.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.410
All right. Then we partners.

13:56.450 --> 13:57.500
- We partners.
- Cool.

14:05.930 --> 14:08.030
You know, I almost
didn't come, Ayanna.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.199
This place is starting
to look like Death Row

14:10.200 --> 14:12.530
instead of Midtown Sound.

14:12.570 --> 14:14.020
Excuse me.

14:16.860 --> 14:19.600
Yo, this is my party, and
I got to be searched?

14:19.640 --> 14:21.479
I'm not trying to take
any chances after

14:21.480 --> 14:23.579
what happened to Jahil.
Have you heard anything?

14:23.580 --> 14:25.100
Yeah, Carlotta says he's fine.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.810
Says I should just
focus on this party.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.300
Lena from Sound House
is in the front row.

14:29.340 --> 14:30.550
You need to impress her.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.050
- You seen Alex?
- Not now. It's showtime.

14:33.090 --> 14:34.800
- Yo, what up, Noah?
- Let's get it.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.260
Welcome, everyone, to <i>The
Truth</i> album release party.

14:40.290 --> 14:42.360
We got Noah Brooks
in the hot seat.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.630
That's Noah!

14:43.660 --> 14:46.000
What was the inspiration
for this album?

14:46.030 --> 14:49.080
Well, uh, my inspiration was...

14:53.110 --> 14:54.780
It was...

14:57.680 --> 14:59.180
I-I'm sorry.

14:59.210 --> 15:00.880
What-what was the question?

15:00.910 --> 15:02.950
Your inspiration.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.700
Um...

15:06.520 --> 15:08.350
Yeah, man, I love your work.

15:08.390 --> 15:10.240
I'm Alexandra Crane, by the way.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.859
- Okay.
- I'm looking to collab

15:11.860 --> 15:13.079
on my new solo track.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.860
You got a sick voice,
just like your old man.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.300
Sellout like her daddy, too.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.260
You just love to pop up
uninvited, don't you?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.150
We're about to lose our girl
group, and you're over here

15:22.170 --> 15:24.100
trying to be America's
Next Top Feature Ho.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.170
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

15:26.210 --> 15:28.010
I've always been
loyal to Take Three.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.320
Till you weren't.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.250
Anyway...

15:35.720 --> 15:37.980
We, uh, saw your performance
in New Orleans.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.990
What was behind that?
It seemed so personal.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.950
- Uh...
- Noah was inspired by his father.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.320
Yeah, my-my father.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.660
Um, I-I don't exactly like
talking about my family,

15:47.690 --> 15:48.890
but my music...

15:48.930 --> 15:50.630
Has a connection to your family.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.300
People like to know
their artists.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.770
Can you get off my back
about my dad, please?

15:56.700 --> 15:58.760
C-Can I... can I...

15:58.800 --> 16:01.170
- can I get some water real quick?
- Sure, take your time.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.410
Are you okay?

16:33.110 --> 16:34.370
Instead...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.270
You know you want this.

16:38.910 --> 16:42.019
Wow, this is crazy.

16:42.020 --> 16:43.356
Who would've thought
we'd be here?

16:43.380 --> 16:45.120
Again.

16:45.150 --> 16:46.920
I always knew.

16:46.950 --> 16:49.090
That's why I still
got paper on you.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.100
It's why you never
asked for a divorce.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.330
You know, I still got that ring.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.130
Mrs. Rivera.

16:59.170 --> 17:01.900
Now, you know...

17:01.940 --> 17:04.140
you ain't supposed...

17:04.170 --> 17:05.839
to call me that.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.109
That was a night of
drunken truth or dare.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.440
That we never undid.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.720
Hey.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.079
You want to do something
crazy, for old times' sake?

17:19.119 --> 17:20.759
Jahil, I'm not flexible

17:20.760 --> 17:22.619
like I used to be.
We can't try that.

17:22.690 --> 17:24.378
- Girl, I ain't talking about that.
- You can't even do that one.

17:24.380 --> 17:25.406
Although, you know what...

17:25.430 --> 17:27.700
I know. I mean, I
would try, I suppose.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.630
Get dressed.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.430
