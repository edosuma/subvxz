[theme song playing]

00:56.424 --> 00:57.625
You know something else?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.093
Bill Cheevers, that
guy that's done

00:59.127 --> 01:02.230
makeup for like the last 10
years, lives with his mother?

01:02.263 --> 01:05.133
Oh yeah.
I know all about him.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.101
Totally straight.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.236
Get out of here.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.304
Hetero from the word go.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.106
No.
Hold that thought.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.374
I got to yell at the girls.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.508
I told you if you
came home late,

01:14.542 --> 01:15.876
I was going to kick your butt.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.844
Oh yeah?

01:16.877 --> 01:18.045
You think you're
big enough to do it?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.380
Let's go.
Come on.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.648
Come on.
Come on.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.049
Come on.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.484
What's going on?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.952
The girls are late.

01:24.985 --> 01:28.489
Boy, I don't know why we bother
to set down any kind of curfew.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.491
They just come home when
they feel like it anyway.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.260
Well, they're
just a little late.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.361
An hour late.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.595
And they don't even
care that we're sitting

01:34.628 --> 01:35.829
here worried sick about 'em.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.198
Gin.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.333
Yeah, you're real worried.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.568
Hey, we're laying
down rules here.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.935
And they're ignoring us.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.771
Yeah, and it's for their own
good anyway 'cause a lot can

01:43.804 --> 01:45.072
happen to a couple
of teenage girls

01:45.105 --> 01:46.674
an hour after the mall closes.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.942
So that's why
we want 'em here.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.212
We just don't
want 'em out there.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.346
I'm gonna get some coffee.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.247
You want some, Dan?

01:53.281 --> 01:54.081
Sure.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.520
Run!

01:59.553 --> 02:00.421
Ho!

02:00.454 --> 02:01.389
Ho!

02:01.422 --> 02:02.656
Ho!

02:02.690 --> 02:03.924
Where the hell you been?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.259
We're really sorry.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.261
What exactly are you sorry
about, that you didn't come

02:07.295 --> 02:08.696
home when we told you
to, that you never

02:08.729 --> 02:10.198
learned how to use a payphone?

02:10.231 --> 02:14.335
Or that you may never
see the light of day again?

02:14.368 --> 02:17.238
That'd be the one.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.606
It's only 10:00.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.940
Which means
you're an hour late.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.343
And you're always
an hour late.

02:22.376 --> 02:27.448
Well then, we're on time.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.516
We said 9:00.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.883
We meant 9:00.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.620
Yeah, because see, we have
this really crazy idea that you

02:32.653 --> 02:35.323
actually listen when we speak.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.590
And when you're
not here by 9:00,

02:36.624 --> 02:37.758
we figure you have a reason.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.793
And if we're not hearing
that reason from you,

02:39.827 --> 02:41.161
then we just sit
here and make up

02:41.195 --> 02:44.365
our own reason like that you're
laying in a ditch somewhere.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.666
We would have called.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.568
But there was no phone in
the ditch we were laying in.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.941
Ha ha?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.142
You're grounded.

02:55.175 --> 02:55.976
Ha ha.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.881
And you're home
tomorrow night.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.416
And you are very, very sorry.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.218
Am I right?
- Yes.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.553
We didn't mean to
make you worry.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.488
It'll never happen again.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.389
All right.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.223
Get upstairs.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.831
Boy, you grounded 'em
real good that time.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.732
Thank you.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.633
Thank you.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.901
Think it'll work?

03:20.934 --> 03:24.204
Probably as good as it
did the last 12 times.

03:24.238 --> 03:28.108
Maybe you should
try something else.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.244
I mean it.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.179
You should talk to him
like they were adults.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.213
They're people.

03:33.247 --> 03:36.116
They can listen to reason.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.586
Honey, Jackie's still here.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.490
Just smile and nod.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.295
Come on!

03:47.328 --> 03:48.128
This is good advice.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.568
[theme song playing]

03:58.105 --> 03:58.972
Hey.

03:59.006 --> 03:59.873
Hey.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.941
What are you doing?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.976
Oh, I'm packing DJ's
little duffel bag.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.280
He's going to stay over at
little Warren's house tonight.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.382
You think that's a good idea?

04:08.416 --> 04:09.950
I mean, isn't little
Warren the one that tied

04:09.983 --> 04:10.851
all those squirrels together?

04:13.721 --> 04:14.588
No!

04:14.622 --> 04:17.190
That was DJ!

04:17.224 --> 04:20.761
Little Warren just stunned 'em.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.063
[doorbell rings]

04:23.096 --> 04:25.165
Honey, get that, would ya?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.167
Sure, why not?

04:27.200 --> 04:30.338
I have nothing else
to do god knows.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.440
Trying to pack a bag for DJ.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.007
You come in don't
have anything to do.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.777
[muttering] You say jump.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.313
And I'm just supposed
to go how high.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.281
- Mrs. Conner?
- Yeah.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.351
Flowers for you.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.251
What's the catch?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.387
I have to buy something?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.390
No, you just take them.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.258
OK.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.126
Did you send me flowers, Dan?

04:53.160 --> 04:53.994
No.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.964
Why would I do that?

04:56.997 --> 04:59.433
Yeah right, like you'd ever be
romantic enough to do something

04:59.467 --> 05:01.802
like that for no reason.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.736
Dear Roseanne, I lied.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.637
They're from me.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.340
Love, Dan.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.176
You scum!

05:09.209 --> 05:10.678
I love you too, dear.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.812
Why'd you do this?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.180
Let me paint the picture.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.884
20 years ago today, I picked
you up in my dad's El Camino,

05:16.917 --> 05:19.019
a little Zeppelin
on the 8-track,

05:19.052 --> 05:20.888
a little Boone's
Farm Apple warming

05:20.921 --> 05:24.224
up in the glove compartment.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.193
Our first date!

05:26.226 --> 05:30.698
No, our first date was a
motorcycle at the A&W drive in.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.701
This is the anniversary
of our first time.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.639
Our second date!

05:42.543 --> 05:44.912
No.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.914
As I recall, I was
able to fend you

05:46.947 --> 05:48.549
off just a little bit longer.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.617
I remember.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.519
We drove to that quaint
little restaurant.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.853
The Blue Swan Cafe.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.690
Yes, nestled there in the
heart of the Blue Swan Motel

05:56.724 --> 05:59.092
out there on highway 72.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.561
I had a New York
steak. you had the shrimp

06:00.594 --> 06:02.963
cocktail and chicken parmesan.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.698
I thought that was so chic.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.166
And the guy kept
calling you sir.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.535
And then he said for the lady.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.636
He meant me.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.337
And I was like really
excited about that.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.409
That was the night I asked
you to be my girlfriend.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.744
Yep.

06:16.777 --> 06:21.815
You said you'd make me the
happiest girl in the whole USA.

06:21.849 --> 06:22.983
Mom, the toilet's broken.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.186
Liar.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.725
Anyhow, remember how we
said we were going to be

06:31.759 --> 06:33.060
more crazy and spontaneous?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.261
Mm-hmm.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.564
Well, tonight I booked
us two dinner reservations

06:36.597 --> 06:38.031
at the Blue Swan Cafe.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.867
Oh, how romantic.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.470
I hope we get that same booth,
you know, the one with the view

06:42.503 --> 06:43.604
of the interstate.

06:43.637 --> 06:47.775
And just the scent
of diesel in the air.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.176
You know, it's
getting so's I can

06:49.209 --> 06:53.481
hardly smell a truck anymore
without thinking of you.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.982
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:55.015 --> 06:55.883
Where are you going?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.150
You're grounded.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.520
No you see, we were
late on Thursday.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.354
So we were grounded last night.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.156
Tonight, we are free.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.192
Oh OK, so where you going?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.727
Me and Dana are
going to the mall.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.996
And they're going to
drop me off at Marcy's.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.231
OK, well since it's
Saturday, you've got till 11.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.365
And your dad and
I are going to be

07:12.399 --> 07:14.234
home early to check on it so.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.672
One minute late, we'll
have your butts in a sling.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.274
You look real nice, Mom.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.076
Thank you.
11 o'clock.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.647
Not nice, thin!

07:26.680 --> 07:29.550
Thin!

07:29.583 --> 07:32.385
[theme song playing]

07:40.994 --> 07:43.731
So tell me about the
first time you ever saw me.

07:43.764 --> 07:48.035
Ah, well you were
coming out of study hall.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.171
And you were wearing
those tight corduroys.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.673
And they were making
this sound when

07:52.706 --> 07:55.909
you were walking down the hall
like they were calling my name.

07:55.943 --> 08:00.280
Dan Conner, Dan
Conner, Dan Conner.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.282
Steak for you.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.451
Chicken parmesan for you.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.587
Yeah, 45 minutes
for a rare steak.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.988
I'd ask for a steak
sauce, but I gotta

08:08.021 --> 08:11.258
be at work Monday morning.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.926
You know, it's 10:30.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.128
We're not even going to
be home till way past 11.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.163
Call home.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.430
Tell the girls we're
going to be late.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.733
OK.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.002
No.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.470
What do you mean, no?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.573
Well, you know,
this grounding stuff

08:25.606 --> 08:26.940
doesn't seem to be working.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.610
So like, ah, let them worry
about us for a while, you know?

08:29.643 --> 08:30.844
Maybe I'll call Jackie.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.245
What do you think?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.947
I'll tell her to go over there
and freak them out for a while.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.348
And then after a little
bit, she can tell

08:35.382 --> 08:37.184
them what's really going on.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.787
Lady, you have an evil mind.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.888
And a body to match.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.662
What was the second thing
you noticed about me?

08:48.696 --> 08:52.199
[laughter] What, what, what?

08:52.232 --> 08:56.303
Oh, it was those big brown
eyes like two chained Dobermans

08:56.336 --> 08:57.537
waiting to rip your leg off.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.339
Good, good, good.
Keep going.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.407
Oh, it's your turn.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.009
What'd you like about me?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.712
Um, the fact that
you asked me out.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.752
What else?

09:11.785 --> 09:14.354
That's about it.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.590
So what, if Tommy Jorgensen
woulda asked you out,

09:16.624 --> 09:18.358
you'd be Mrs. Tommy
Jorgensen right now?

09:18.391 --> 09:22.529
Oh, like Tommy
Jorgensen'd ever ask me out!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.531
Oh, get off the
sympathy wagon, Roseanne.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.366
There were plenty of guys
standing in line for you

09:26.399 --> 09:29.136
to treat 'em like dirt.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.904
I was just the lucky one.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.473
Now I remember what I liked
about you, Dan, the fact

09:33.506 --> 09:36.309
that you could just
spread it on so thick.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.645
Come on, Roseanne.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.380
What about me made you quiver?

09:40.413 --> 09:44.584
Well, I'd have to say
it was the forearms.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.686
Really?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.621
Yeah.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.624
They were the biggest, manliest,
meatiest hunks of flesh

09:50.658 --> 09:52.392
I ever laid my eyes on.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.528
The pythons, huh?

09:55.562 --> 09:58.732
I remember like I would sneak
these looks at you in class.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.901
And you'd start rolling
your sleeve up really

10:00.934 --> 10:04.738
slow you know just to tease me.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.173
Why, it was all I
could do to keep

10:06.206 --> 10:07.474
from climbing over
all those desks

10:07.507 --> 10:09.242
and just throwing
you to the floor.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.716
You know, [clears throat]
since we're not rushing home,

10:15.749 --> 10:17.384
maybe after dinner
we could see if they

10:17.417 --> 10:20.287
get our old room vacant.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.990
Oh, I never thought
I'd say this, Dan.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.894
But let's skip dessert.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.830
[theme song playing]

10:39.973 --> 10:41.141
JACKIE: Darlene!
- OK.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.042
10 minutes.

10:42.075 --> 10:42.943
10 lousy minutes.

10:42.976 --> 10:43.877
But it's not my--

10:43.911 --> 10:45.045
Don't sweat it.

10:45.078 --> 10:45.946
They're not home.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.280
Then I'm not late!

10:47.314 --> 10:48.181
Right?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.549
Yeah, don't worry, Darlene.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.885
I wouldn't rat on ya.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.221
You know, now that
you mention it though,

10:54.254 --> 10:57.190
it is kind of strange
they're not back yet.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.960
Oh, I didn't mention it.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.194
I wonder where they could be.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.863
Hmm.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.764
You want some ice cream?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.899
Sure.

11:05.933 --> 11:06.800
What are you doing here?

11:06.834 --> 11:07.868
Oh, a load of laundry.

11:13.573 --> 11:17.177
Nah, I'm-- I'm sure they're OK.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.946
Ow, ooh, ow.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.847
Ow, ow, ow.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.414
Oh they're not home yet.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.784
Oh, cool.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.684
Roseanne?

11:24.718 --> 11:26.053
Oh, Becky.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.054
Yeah.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.055
Hi.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.923
Hi.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.058
What is she doing here?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.325
Laundry.
Don't worry.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.460
She won't tell.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.962
You know, it's kind of
weird they're not here.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.196
I mean, after that
whole deal they've

11:36.229 --> 11:37.564
been making about
curfew and everything,

11:37.597 --> 11:39.466
I thought I'd be grounded
before I even opened the door.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.533
Yeah.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.602
This is the kind of
stuff they live for.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.004
There you go.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.905
Thanks.

11:44.938 --> 11:45.873
You're not having any?

11:45.906 --> 11:46.874
No.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.210
I'm not really hungry
all of a sudden.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.550
So you girls have fun tonight?

11:57.584 --> 11:58.485
Yeah.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.619
JACKIE: Yeah?
- Yeah, it was OK.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.720
Yeah.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.022
What'd you do?
- Well, I went down to the--

12:02.055 --> 12:03.156
I'm going to go
make a phone call.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.763
Crystal, hi.

12:09.797 --> 12:10.730
Yeah, I know it's late.

12:10.764 --> 12:11.564
I'm sorry.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.070
Have you heard from Roseanne?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.439
Yeah.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.808
OK.
Sure.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.009
Yeah.
Thanks.

12:22.042 --> 12:22.843
Buh-bye.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.316
Crystal says hi.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.984
Aunt Jackie, what's going on?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.820
I'm just thinking that
it's not like your folks

12:32.853 --> 12:34.254
to be this late.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.189
Well, maybe their
car broke down again.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.190
Yeah, that's probably it.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.292
Yeah.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.061
Yeah.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.963
Oh, boy.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.465
This is the kind of
night that cops hate.

12:50.470 --> 12:55.642
Lot of accidents, but
I'm sure they're OK.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.919
Wonder what's
taking 'em so long.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.587
You don't think there's
a problem, do you?

13:20.934 --> 13:23.837
[theme song playing]

13:23.871 --> 13:26.239
[sultry jazz music]

13:37.684 --> 13:41.154
So what do you want to do now?

13:41.188 --> 13:44.057
What'd we do 20 years ago?

13:44.091 --> 13:45.158
Well, let's see.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.793
You were in the bathroom
putting on a fresh coat

13:46.826 --> 13:47.627
of white lipstick.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.099
And you were out on
the payphone bragging

13:52.132 --> 13:53.400
to your buddies.

13:53.433 --> 13:58.438
I still do that.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.672
I remember what we did we.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.942
Filled up that huge bath
tub and played voyage

14:01.975 --> 14:04.111
to the bottom of the sea.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.045
Oh, yeah!

14:05.078 --> 14:06.079
You kept going ooh!

14:06.113 --> 14:06.980
Ooh!

14:07.014 --> 14:10.817
[roseanne laughing]

14:10.850 --> 14:12.920
Let's do that again.

14:12.953 --> 14:13.853
OK.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.255
This time I get to
be Captain Nemo.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.860
[music]

14:20.894 --> 14:22.195
No towel snapping.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.931
Oh, I'm not
making any promises.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.434
[music]

14:27.467 --> 14:29.236
Hey, would you look at that?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.739
Boy, that tub
got a lot smaller.

14:32.772 --> 14:37.544
[music]

14:37.577 --> 14:39.947
It is really
icing up out there.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.983
What are they
doing out so late?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.751
Are you getting worried?

14:44.784 --> 14:46.586
No.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.754
You?

14:47.787 --> 14:48.588
No.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.327
How long could it
take to eat dinner?

14:54.361 --> 14:55.895
Yeah, and if they were
going to be this late,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.830
how come they didn't call?

14:57.864 --> 14:59.066
I mean, this is just so weird!

14:59.099 --> 15:00.633
Because they were just
telling us how much

15:00.667 --> 15:01.868
they worry when we're late.

15:07.707 --> 15:11.044
And here we are
worrying about them.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.613
Incredible coincidence or
a lesson for the kiddies?

15:13.646 --> 15:16.583
You make the call.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.650
And check.

15:17.684 --> 15:22.722
He's doing laundry
at 11:30 on Saturday.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.857
But there's no laundry.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.194
Oh, well, I just
can't believe that one.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.563
Isn't this just a little
bit too cutesy for them?

15:30.597 --> 15:33.633
I think they've been
watching too much TV.

15:33.666 --> 15:38.238
So, like, Aunt Jackie is just
here to make sure we worry?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.207
Well, we can't let
her down now, can we?

15:48.415 --> 15:49.716
DARLENE: Still no
sign of them, eh?

15:49.749 --> 15:50.917
Mm-mm.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.421
I got to admit, guys, I'm
starting to get worried.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.322
That's it.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.589
I'm calling the police.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.325
No, no, no, we can't do that.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.726
Why not?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.262
Well, you'd have to say that
it was a missing persons thing

16:02.295 --> 16:06.833
and they don't like that.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.501
But maybe mom and
dad are missing.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.670
Well, they're
not missing enough.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.972
They would have to be
missing for 24 hours

16:13.006 --> 16:15.708
before the cops will do
that missing person thing.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.278
Well, if they're not
missing, then what are they?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.280
I mean, let's face it,
even mom and dad can't

16:20.313 --> 16:21.481
eat dinner for four hours.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.321
Oh, my God.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.689
They could be dead!

16:29.722 --> 16:32.359
Let's not go crazy here.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.260
They're dead!

16:36.063 --> 16:39.332
They're big, giant street pizzas
and they're out on the highway

16:39.366 --> 16:40.533
all squishy.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.436
Those 18 wheels running
over them, squish-squish!

16:43.470 --> 16:44.337
Squish-squish!

16:44.371 --> 16:46.806
Mommy, Daddy!

16:46.839 --> 16:49.309
Are we done now?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.078
But we're so worried.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.981
You are rotten, rotten
kids and I can't even

16:55.014 --> 16:59.386
believe I'm related to you two!

16:59.419 --> 17:01.854
Does that mean you won't
adopt us, Aunt Jackie?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.423
What will become
of us, Darlene?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.892
We'll be orphans.

17:05.925 --> 17:10.363
DARLENE AND BECKY: The
sun'll come out tomorrow.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.564
JACKIE: You two are very funny.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.166
DARLENE AND BECKY: Bet
your bottom dollar that--

17:13.200 --> 17:15.668
JACKIE: Knock it off!

17:15.702 --> 17:17.904
So your mom's little
idea didn't work.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.372
That's fine.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.773
Why don't we sit
down here and discuss

17:20.807 --> 17:22.509
this curfew thing as adults?

17:22.542 --> 17:23.410
OK?

17:23.443 --> 17:25.345
All right.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.179
Um...

17:29.482 --> 17:30.683
See.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.951
All right.

17:31.984 --> 17:36.656
First of all, don't think
of curfew as a punishment.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.825
You see, your parents
don't think that way.

17:38.858 --> 17:42.929
To them, it's a way of
showing their concern.

17:42.962 --> 17:47.467
So think of curfew as your
parent's way of saying I

17:47.500 --> 17:50.470
love you.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.273
BECKY: I curfew, Darlene.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.874
DARLENE: Well, I
curfew too, Beck.

17:54.907 --> 17:55.775
All right, that's it.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.709
Both of you, upstairs.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.511
You're grounded!
That's it!

17:58.545 --> 18:00.680
You're rotten, rotten,
rotten, rotten kids!

18:00.713 --> 18:03.150
DARLENE AND BECKY: Tomorrow!

18:03.183 --> 18:05.585
[music]

18:10.157 --> 18:11.090
ROSEANNE: What are you doing?

18:11.124 --> 18:11.991
DAN: Nothing.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.195
ROSEANNE: You took extra cheese!

18:15.228 --> 18:16.763
Cheese fell off my slice.

18:16.796 --> 18:17.897
I'm putting it back on.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.199
It pulled all the
cheese off of this piece!

18:19.232 --> 18:20.433
Eat the other piece.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.302
I don't want that.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.736
I want the one with
the brown bubble on it.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.373
You're not getting my cheese!

18:26.406 --> 18:27.274
Dan?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.442
What?

18:29.476 --> 18:31.911
Well, we could be having
this argument at home

18:31.944 --> 18:34.914
and it wouldn't be costing
us 14 bucks an hour.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.815
What are you saying?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.650
You want to go home?

18:37.684 --> 18:38.985
I don't know.
Do you?

18:39.018 --> 18:39.886
No!

18:39.919 --> 18:41.888
We can't go home yet!

18:41.921 --> 18:43.156
This a romantic thing.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.393
We're celebrating a
great moment in our life.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.294

- No.

But that was the one where
Hoss finds the leprechauns!

We're not watching TV.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.408

19:05.612 --> 19:06.779
Oh, yeah!

19:06.813 --> 19:08.548
I completely forgot how
much I used to love that.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.749
Yeah.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.017
Remember last time we
couldn't get enough of it

19:11.050 --> 19:12.685
and we only had
quarters between us?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.754
And one of them
was for the wine.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.123
Only the best for my baby.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.024
What do you think?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.292
Should I crank it up?

19:19.326 --> 19:21.294
Crank away, my bishop of love.

I'm going to throw up.

We were getting
too old for this.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.196
No!

19:57.230 --> 19:58.097
No.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.866
It was great, honey.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.801
Great as the last time?

20:01.834 --> 20:03.603
Better.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.104
You know why?

20:05.137 --> 20:07.474
Because this time we're in love.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.975
I was in love the other time.

20:09.008 --> 20:09.809
Me too.

20:12.279 --> 20:16.182
[theme music]

20:16.215 --> 20:20.152
Well, thanks for walking
me to my door Mr. Conner.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.589
You're welcome, Miss Harris.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.156
So are you ever
going to call me again,

20:24.190 --> 20:28.160
or is it just wham,
bam, thank you Roseanne?

20:28.194 --> 20:29.396
Hey, don't say that.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.763
You're my girl.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.365
Now, I want to
tell you something

20:32.399 --> 20:34.767
I never told anybody before.

20:34.801 --> 20:38.170
This is my first time.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.005
I know.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.312
How about a good kiss?

20:45.345 --> 20:48.715
Oh, maybe one.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.182
[chuckling]

20:50.216 --> 20:52.118
One more.

20:52.151 --> 20:55.522
Uh, OK.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.690
Remember that night
when we played one more

20:57.724 --> 21:00.293
kiss for about half a hour?

21:00.327 --> 21:01.193
Then the door opened.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.529
It was my dad.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.397
In his underwear.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.066
He was reading
us the riot act.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.368
Daddy's not here now.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.473
Where have you been?

21:13.506 --> 21:14.941
Do you know what time it is?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.709
Couldn't you pick up a phone?

21:16.743 --> 21:19.479
I mean, we thought you
were dead in a ditch.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.847
I don't think our
plot worked, dear.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.315
BECKY: Do you have any
idea what time it is?

21:22.349 --> 21:23.249
I have an idea.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.351
Let's try something new.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.986
DARLENE: You're grounded.

21:27.019 --> 21:27.954
[deadbolt clicking]

21:27.987 --> 21:28.855
BECKY: Hey!

21:28.888 --> 21:30.289
Hey!

21:30.323 --> 21:31.290
DARLENE: Let us in!

21:31.324 --> 21:33.092
Hey!
Come on!

21:33.125 --> 21:34.193
It's cold out here.
Come on!

21:34.226 --> 21:35.261
That's what we needed all along.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.229
Now they can't
wait to come home.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.965

21:48.375 --> 21:50.710
