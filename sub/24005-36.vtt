If I'm in the middle
of a fight,

40:26.090 --> 40:27.759
I wouldn't want my bow
to come apart.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.093
Now let's talk about
your arrows.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.929
The tip that
didn't hit the plate

40:30.929 --> 40:32.805
is in perfect order.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.807
The next one flattened its tip.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.352
The third one has
a pretty significant bend

40:37.352 --> 40:38.853
to the arrowhead.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.190
But in general,
they're all still tight

40:42.190 --> 40:43.524
and in one piece, so well done.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.525
- Thank you, sir.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.070
- Tommy, Michael,

40:47.070 --> 40:47.987
when you guys showed up
to The Forge

40:47.987 --> 40:48.988
you had no idea what was

40:48.988 --> 40:50.323
in store for you.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.116
We had you make
crusader daggers

40:52.116 --> 40:53.368
and then were
given instructions

40:53.368 --> 40:55.954
by Taron Egerton and Jamie Foxx

40:55.954 --> 40:59.040
from the new "Robin Hood" film
on your bows.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.209
The judges have made
their final decision.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.836
Our next "Forged in Fire"
champion is...

41:03.836 --> 41:06.923

41:06.923 --> 41:08.007
Tommy.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.133
Congratulations, you're

41:09.133 --> 41:10.635
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.594
Michael, unfortunately
your weapon

41:11.594 --> 41:13.054
didn't make the cut.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.223
David Baker's gonna
tell you why.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.350
- Michael, you brought us
a really creative

41:17.350 --> 41:19.477
and unique-designed bow.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.520
But its large weight,

41:20.520 --> 41:22.397
even in the takedown position,

41:22.397 --> 41:24.524
would be difficult to conceal,

41:24.524 --> 41:26.484
and its short draw length--

41:26.484 --> 41:28.736
well, those two things
led us to this decision.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.114
- Michael, you did a great job.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.240
But at this time
I have to ask you

41:32.240 --> 41:34.075
to please surrender your bow.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.827
<i>- I made three great friends,</i>

41:35.827 --> 41:37.662

41:37.662 --> 41:39.789
Tommy's bow was higher quality.

41:39.789 --> 41:42.375

41:46.587 --> 41:48.089

41:48.089 --> 41:49.382
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion

41:49.382 --> 41:50.341
and that's a title that comes

41:50.341 --> 41:52.760
with a check for $10,000.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.346
Please present your bow
to the judges.
