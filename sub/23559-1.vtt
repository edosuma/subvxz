02:14.573 --> 02:16.506
<i>The communion of saints...</i>

02:16.573 --> 02:19.904
<i>forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body...</i>

02:19.973 --> 02:21.906
<i>and life everlasting.</i>

02:21.973 --> 02:24.269
<i>Amen.</i>

02:24.339 --> 02:26.330
Let us pray.

02:28.308 --> 02:30.740
Lord, have mercy upon us.

02:30.808 --> 02:32.740
Christ, have mercy upon us.

02:32.809 --> 02:35.138
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Amen.

02:35.209 --> 02:37.402
Our Father.

02:37.475 --> 02:39.703
Our Father, which art
in heaven, hallowed...

02:39.776 --> 02:42.707
Dear God, there's something
I want to ask you.

02:42.775 --> 02:44.707
Of course you know what it is...

02:44.776 --> 02:47.708
because you know everything that's
going to happen before it happens...

02:47.775 --> 02:50.208
so there's really
no need to ask you.

02:50.276 --> 02:52.708
But I thought I'd ask
you in any case.

02:52.776 --> 02:55.209
Now, you know that I believe in you.

02:55.278 --> 02:58.506
But I was wondering if you could
give me just a little sign.

03:04.311 --> 03:07.245
I mean, I'm not saying that if
you don't give me the sign...

03:07.312 --> 03:10.641
that I won't believe in you... I'm not
threatening you or anything like that.

03:10.711 --> 03:13.644
<i>But please, please give
me enough courage...</i>

03:13.712 --> 03:16.769
<i>to speak to Margaret Spencer
and get to know her.</i>

03:16.845 --> 03:19.936
O God, make clean our
hearts within us.

03:20.012 --> 03:22.773
And take not thy
holy spirit from us.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.095
Miss Spencer...

03:29.846 --> 03:32.836
I wonder if I could
have a word with you.

03:32.914 --> 03:34.812
There's something
I've got to tell you...

03:34.881 --> 03:38.142
something I've got to
bring out into the open.

03:38.214 --> 03:40.646
I've been bottling it up
inside me too long...

03:40.714 --> 03:44.339
and there's no point
in hiding it anymore.

03:44.415 --> 03:47.848
For six years now, ever since
you came to Wimpy's...

03:47.916 --> 03:50.780
I've been in love with you.

03:50.848 --> 03:53.644
I only live to hear your voice.

03:53.716 --> 03:57.079
One cheeseburger, one shanty,
one portion french fries.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.082
Each time you speak...

03:59.150 --> 04:03.276
it's like a thousand violins
playing in the halls of heaven.

04:03.350 --> 04:05.317
I-I love you, Miss Spencer.

04:05.384 --> 04:08.611
I love everything about you...

04:08.684 --> 04:13.448
the way you walk, your sweet
smile, your easy grace and charm.

04:13.519 --> 04:17.349
Wimpy Burgers twice, one M.R.,
one well, heavy on the onions.

04:17.418 --> 04:20.942
I wish I could take you
away from all this.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.610
I'd like us to start a
new life together...

04:23.686 --> 04:27.949
a little house of our own, a car,
the two of us against the world...

04:28.019 --> 04:30.814
joined forevermore in holy wedlock.

04:36.969 --> 04:38.147
Miss Spencer!

04:38.281 --> 04:39.647
What?

04:45.059 --> 04:46.697
Nothing.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.258
Good evening.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.017
I couldn't help noticing that you were
making an unsuccessful suicide bid.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.355
What are you doing in my room?
What do you want?
I'm here to help you, Mr. Moon.

05:32.426 --> 05:35.586
- I don't want any help. Please go away.
- Oh, all right.

05:35.659 --> 05:38.956
I just thought you might be interested
in a little matter of a million pounds.

05:39.027 --> 05:40.617
A million pounds?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.524
Don't let me interfere with
your doing away with yourself.

05:46.593 --> 05:48.525
What's this about a million pounds?

05:48.593 --> 05:50.525
- May I come in?
- Yes, please do.

05:50.593 --> 05:53.685
Thank you. I wonder if you'd
mind taking my cloak.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.249
Hang it somewhere dry, would you.

05:58.394 --> 06:00.987
- Might I sit down?
- Oh. Do.

06:01.063 --> 06:02.994
Thank you.

06:03.062 --> 06:06.357
- It's a very nasty little place you've got here.
- Oh. Thank you.

06:06.428 --> 06:08.361
What's this about a million pounds?

06:08.428 --> 06:10.361
Oh, a million pounds, yes.

06:10.428 --> 06:12.487
You remember your
great-great-great-grandfather?

06:12.563 --> 06:14.790
Well, I never even met my father.

06:14.862 --> 06:17.852
- How very sad.
- Excuse me.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.562
In all events, your great-great-great-
grandfather, Ephraim Moon...

06:23.630 --> 06:26.563
sailed for Australia in
1782 on a ship of the line.

06:26.631 --> 06:28.927
Set himself up as an apothecary.

06:28.998 --> 06:30.930
The business flourished...

06:30.998 --> 06:33.931
and by the time he died it was worth
something in the region of £2,000.

06:33.999 --> 06:36.260
A large amount in those days.
Yes.

06:36.331 --> 06:38.763
Your great-great-grandfather,
Cedric Moon...

06:38.832 --> 06:41.264
by skillful management
and careful husbandry...

06:41.331 --> 06:43.265
increased that sum a hundredfold.

06:43.331 --> 06:46.924
This, in turn, was inherited by your
great-grandfather, Desmond Moon...

06:46.999 --> 06:49.261
who expanded, diversified...

06:49.332 --> 06:54.426
and built up a personal fortune
of well over a million pounds.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.329
Oh. That's a lot of money.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.127
A great deal of money, Mr. Moon.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.758
And this gigantic sum...

07:01.834 --> 07:05.096
was inherited by your
grandfather, Hubert Moon...

07:05.168 --> 07:08.930
who returned to London and frittered it
away on wine, women and loose living.

07:11.069 --> 07:13.591
Uh, where does that leave me then?

07:13.668 --> 07:16.897
Penniless and on the
brink of suicide.

07:20.569 --> 07:23.500
You get out of here
before I call the police.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.500
Before you call the what?
The police.

07:25.569 --> 07:28.501
You realize that suicide
is a criminal offense.

07:28.569 --> 07:31.559
In less enlightened times
they'd have hung you for it.

07:33.737 --> 07:35.669
Look, exactly what do you want?

07:35.736 --> 07:38.668
I told you.
Seriously, I want to help you.

07:38.736 --> 07:41.669
Unburden yourself. It does you
good to share your problems.

07:41.737 --> 07:44.670
What interest is it to you?

07:44.738 --> 07:47.899
Please go away!
I'm interested in everybody.

07:47.973 --> 07:51.098
Please tell me. What drove
you to this desperate act?

07:51.173 --> 07:53.605
All right, I'll tell you.
I'm miserable.

07:53.672 --> 07:56.604
I've got a boring job, no
money, no prospects...

07:56.671 --> 08:01.105
I haven't got a girlfriend, I can't get to know
anyone, no one wants to get to know me...

08:01.173 --> 08:03.105
and everything is hopeless.

08:03.173 --> 08:05.105
All right? Satisfied?

08:05.173 --> 08:08.197
And if you really want to help me,
you can get me a sock for this pipe.

08:08.273 --> 08:11.638
Oh, yes. They're in the top
left-hand drawer, aren't they?
Yeah.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.038
But suicide, Mr. Moon?

08:14.108 --> 08:16.039
Really, really, really.

08:16.108 --> 08:18.039
That's the last thing you should do.

08:18.108 --> 08:21.041
Don't you think it's
taking the easy way out?

08:21.108 --> 08:23.041
Easy way out?

08:23.108 --> 08:25.041
What's easy about it?

08:25.108 --> 08:27.540
Look. The bleedin' pipe's broken.

08:27.610 --> 08:29.541
Can't even manage to kill myself.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.539
Let's face it, Mr. Moon...
you're a complete failure.

08:32.607 --> 08:34.940
Yes... Oh.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.943
I'll fix that.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.601
You know that million
pounds I mentioned?

08:39.677 --> 08:41.609
Yes?
I wasn't joking.

08:41.677 --> 08:43.836
I could give you that and more.

08:43.910 --> 08:46.342
Everything you've ever seen
in the advertisements...

08:46.411 --> 08:48.343
fast, white convertibles...

08:48.411 --> 08:51.342
blonde women, their hair
trailing in the wind...

08:51.410 --> 08:53.343
wafer-thin after-dinner chocolates.

08:53.411 --> 08:56.036
If you had all that, would
you be any happier?

08:56.111 --> 08:58.134
What are you on about?

08:58.211 --> 09:01.077
Would the words Prince of
Darkness mean anything to you?

09:01.146 --> 09:04.044
Beelzebub? Mephistopheles?
The horned one?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.178
I know. You've escaped
from somewhere.

09:08.246 --> 09:10.178
No, I haven't, Mr. Moon.

09:10.246 --> 09:13.975
I'm the horned one, the devil.
Let me give you my card.

09:17.247 --> 09:19.542
Oh, yes, the devil. Of course.

09:19.613 --> 09:21.546
Silly old me.

09:21.614 --> 09:24.410
Cor blimey!
I left my hankie at Wimpy's.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.641
I wonder if you'll excuse me.
Don't rush away, Mr. Moon.

09:27.715 --> 09:30.011
You're a nutcase.
You're a bleedin' nutcase.

09:30.082 --> 09:32.809
They said the same of Jesus
Christ, Freud and Galileo.

09:32.881 --> 09:34.848
They said it of a lot
of nutcases too.

09:34.917 --> 09:37.848
You're not as stupid as you
look, are you, Mr. Moon?

09:37.915 --> 09:41.077
What can I do to convince
you that I'm the devil?

09:41.149 --> 09:44.081
Supposing I granted you your
dearest wish here and now?

09:44.149 --> 09:46.272
What about that girl at Wimpy's?

09:46.348 --> 09:48.976
Margaret Spencer?
Yes.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.981
How do you know about her?

09:51.049 --> 09:53.483
And how do you know
so much about me...

09:53.552 --> 09:55.484
where my socks are and
who my grandfather was?

09:55.552 --> 09:58.176
I told you.
I've been taking an interest in you.

09:58.251 --> 10:00.980
Look, well, supposing I, um...

10:01.052 --> 10:02.983
gave you a trial wish.

10:03.051 --> 10:05.482
No obligation on your part.
Just to get acquainted.

10:05.551 --> 10:08.313
Is there anything in the
world you really desire?

10:08.385 --> 10:10.350
Margaret Spen...
Aside from Margaret Spencer.

10:10.418 --> 10:13.009
We'll save her till later, when
you sign. Anything else?

10:13.085 --> 10:17.518
Um... a Frobisher and Gleason
raspberry-flavored ice lolly.

10:17.585 --> 10:19.518
Very well, Mr. Moon.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.882
Conclusively to prove that
I am indeed the unholy one...

10:22.953 --> 10:25.612
a Frobisher and Gleason
raspberry-flavored ice lolly...

10:25.686 --> 10:27.619
shall be yours...

10:27.687 --> 10:29.676
in a trice.

10:36.621 --> 10:39.553
Here you are.
Thank you.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.554
Oh, um, have you got sixpence?

10:41.621 --> 10:44.144
I've only got a million-pound note.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.153
- Thank you.
- Ta.

10:46.221 --> 10:48.711
Convinced?
Do me a favor.

10:48.789 --> 10:50.722
I could have done that myself.

10:50.789 --> 10:52.778
I thought you were
gonna conjure it up.

10:52.856 --> 10:56.448
You're just like all the rest, aren't you?
No proof is good enough.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.545
I want a miracle.

10:58.623 --> 11:00.556
A rain of toads or something.

11:00.624 --> 11:04.055
All right then. Which of the
cheap tricks is it gonna be?

11:04.123 --> 11:06.555
Wine into water?
Stick into serpent?

11:06.624 --> 11:09.455
How about flying through
space at the speed of light?

11:09.524 --> 11:13.047
How about you checking in to the nearest
loony bin for a few weeks' holiday?

11:13.124 --> 11:15.558
O ye of little faith, Moon.

11:15.627 --> 11:17.955
You're not wearing nylon
underwear, are you?

11:18.024 --> 11:20.514
Why?
It disintegrates at high speeds.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.525
Prepare yourself.

11:22.592 --> 11:24.387
The magic words: I.B.J.

11:26.525 --> 11:28.788
Here, my ice lolly's melted.

11:30.193 --> 11:32.125
You really must be the devil.

11:32.193 --> 11:35.182
Incarnate. How do you do?
Oh. How do you do?

11:41.629 --> 11:43.617
Where are we? Is this hell?

11:43.695 --> 11:45.489
Just my London headquarters.

11:46.428 --> 11:48.587
That's not your name, is it?

11:48.662 --> 11:51.628
George Spiggott?

11:51.695 --> 11:54.855
Come on in. It's one of my many
earthly pseudoplumes, or nom de nyms.

11:54.929 --> 11:56.860
I thought you were called Lucifer.

11:56.929 --> 11:59.360
I know. The Bringer of the
Light, it used to be.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.053
Sounded a bit pouffy to me.

12:01.128 --> 12:03.061
God keeps changing his
name too, you know.

12:03.128 --> 12:05.062
He used to be called the Word.

12:05.129 --> 12:08.063
Yeah."ln the beginning was the Word."
"And the Word was God."

12:08.130 --> 12:11.062
Was there just a word
hanging about in space then?
I suppose so.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.062
I wasn't there.

12:13.129 --> 12:15.858
What's it mean,"the Word"?
What does"Stanley Moon" mean?

12:15.931 --> 12:17.920
Evening, Anger.

12:22.531 --> 12:25.463
It's all right, Anger.
He's with me.

12:25.531 --> 12:27.464
Come in, Mr. Moon.

12:27.532 --> 12:30.464
I'd like you to meet Anger.
He works for me.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.690
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

12:32.765 --> 12:34.994
Watch it, that's all.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.898
This is the, uh, Club Room.

12:39.966 --> 12:43.797
It's, uh, quite nicely decorated
and painted. Early Hitler.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.799
Now, what about my
little proposition?

12:45.867 --> 12:49.196
All I want from you is something you
probably don't even realize you have.

12:49.267 --> 12:51.199
I'm talking about your soul.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.198
My soul?
Yes.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.199
Like you collect moths...

12:55.268 --> 12:57.200
I collect souls.

12:57.269 --> 13:00.200
I'd like to add yours
to my collection.

13:00.268 --> 13:03.134
What are you doing?
Just a bit of routine mischief.

13:03.202 --> 13:05.168
Now, then, what about your soul?

13:05.236 --> 13:09.565
Well, uh, I don't know where it
is or how to get hold of it.

13:09.636 --> 13:11.568
Exactly.

13:11.636 --> 13:15.694
And all I want from you is the exclusive
global and universal rights to it.

13:16.836 --> 13:18.995
But if you took it
out, wouldn't it hurt?

13:19.069 --> 13:21.002
It's a painless operation.

13:21.070 --> 13:23.468
And afterwards, you
won't feel a thing.

13:23.538 --> 13:25.560
Besides, it's been no earthly
good to you, has it?

13:25.637 --> 13:27.399
Like to look at the contract?
Yes, please.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.404
There we are.

13:29.472 --> 13:33.063
Your soul's rather like your appendix...
totally expendable.

13:33.138 --> 13:35.571
There was a time when it
did have a function...

13:35.639 --> 13:40.071
but nowadays the vast majority
of people never use it.

13:40.138 --> 13:42.571
Looks a bit complicated.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.571
It's a standard contract.

13:44.639 --> 13:47.571
Gives you seven wishes in accordance
with the mystic rules of life...

13:47.638 --> 13:52.072
seven days of the week, seven deadly sins,
seven seas, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.071
Look, if you're not interested...

13:54.140 --> 13:57.130
I'm sure there's thousands of others
who'd jump at the opportunity.

13:58.274 --> 14:00.400
No, it's just a bit
sudden, that's all.

14:00.475 --> 14:03.498
Read it through on your own time.

14:05.574 --> 14:07.506
"I, Stanley Moon...

14:07.574 --> 14:09.507
"hereinafter and in the hereafter...

14:09.575 --> 14:12.166
to be known as the damned..."

14:12.241 --> 14:15.698
The damned?
It's a form of words. Legal jargon.

14:17.310 --> 14:20.706
"Do warrant that I am the
sole owner of my soul."

14:22.577 --> 14:26.304
But what about Margaret? Do you promise
that I'll have her all to myself?

14:26.377 --> 14:28.366
Sign that...

14:29.378 --> 14:31.240
and Margaret Spencer...

14:31.310 --> 14:33.173
will be yours.

14:33.243 --> 14:37.438
"Dear Miss Spencer, this
is just to say cheerio.

14:37.511 --> 14:40.305
"Yours sincerely, Stanley Moon.

14:40.377 --> 14:44.573
P.S. I leave you my
collection of moths."

14:44.646 --> 14:47.076
Just how well did you know Mr. Moon?

14:47.144 --> 14:50.077
Not at all, really.
I used to see him at Wimpy's.

14:50.145 --> 14:53.578
Well, it does seem that, of all the people
in his life, you were the closest to him.

14:53.647 --> 14:57.169
Why else would he leave you that note?
I suppose that must be true.

14:57.245 --> 14:59.837
How awful.

14:59.912 --> 15:03.310
Have you any idea why he
contemplated this rash act?

15:03.380 --> 15:05.312
Can't say, really.

15:05.380 --> 15:08.314
At work he always seems
so calm and quiet.

15:08.382 --> 15:10.314
Sorry to be so blunt,
Miss Spencer...

15:10.382 --> 15:14.337
but are you sure you're not concealing your
relationship with the would-be deceased?

15:14.414 --> 15:17.869
Wasn't a relationship.
I scarcely knew the man.

15:19.481 --> 15:22.141
What are you doing all
that measuring for?

15:22.215 --> 15:25.306
Eh? Oh, we always do
this, Miss Spencer.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.349
You'd be amazed how
often it pays off.

15:27.415 --> 15:30.349
Now, did you say anything
that might have upset him?

15:30.416 --> 15:32.813
Can you remember your
exact last words to him?

15:32.881 --> 15:35.145
I think it was...

15:35.217 --> 15:39.876
"Wimpy Burgers twice, one M.R.,
one well, heavy on the onions."

15:39.949 --> 15:42.747
Yes, I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

15:44.584 --> 15:47.516
- It all seems to be quite straightforward.
- Good.

15:47.584 --> 15:50.778
All we need do now, then,
is get it witnessed.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.815
Sloth would be best. He's a lawyer.

16:00.785 --> 16:04.684
Come on now, Sloth!
Wake up, you idle, great slob!

16:04.753 --> 16:06.685
Here, are all your staff like this?

16:06.753 --> 16:09.685
That's the trouble. I can't get
any decent help these days.

16:09.752 --> 16:11.685
God's laughing, of course.

16:11.752 --> 16:14.185
All he has to do is raise
his little finger...

16:14.253 --> 16:18.481
he's got a thousand sycophantic,
prissy angels at his beck and call.

16:18.553 --> 16:20.916
I'm lumbered with Anger and Sloth.

16:20.986 --> 16:24.079
Wake up, you lazy, legal layabout!

16:24.154 --> 16:26.746
Get up! Wake up!

16:29.855 --> 16:32.151
Here, well, this is Stanley Moon.

16:32.221 --> 16:36.155
He's selling me his soul, and I want
you to witness it on this document.

16:36.222 --> 16:38.155
I want you to do some writing.

16:38.222 --> 16:40.348
That's your forte, isn't it?
Writing.

16:40.424 --> 16:43.356
Where it says,"ln the
presence of," your signature.

16:43.425 --> 16:45.356
Your name. Remember that one?

16:45.425 --> 16:48.014
Y... Yeah.
Sloth.

16:48.089 --> 16:50.988
S... I...
S... I...

16:51.057 --> 16:54.252
O... T...
O... T...

16:54.325 --> 16:56.723
T... H.

16:56.792 --> 16:59.951
Right. Very nice.
Now it's your turn.

17:00.024 --> 17:02.288
Um...

17:02.360 --> 17:04.290
there's just one thing, though.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.276
You're not having second
thoughts, are you?

17:06.301 --> 17:10.258
No. But shouldn't I sign in blood?
Blimey, you are a traditionalist.

17:10.327 --> 17:12.258
All right then.

17:12.327 --> 17:14.383
Let's use some of his.
He'll never notice.

17:16.093 --> 17:18.082
There we are. Help yourself.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.884
Well done.
Welcome to the club.

17:28.961 --> 17:32.484
- When can I get started on my wishes?
- Soon as you like.

17:34.294 --> 17:37.228
And if, by any chance,
you become dissatisfied...

17:37.296 --> 17:39.726
all you have to do is go...

17:39.795 --> 17:41.886
Just go...
You just go...

17:41.960 --> 17:45.156
This'll terminate your wish and bring
you back to me, wherever I am.

17:45.229 --> 17:47.161
Here we are. "M."

17:47.229 --> 17:49.162
Let's see, um...

17:49.230 --> 17:53.162
Machiavelli, McCarthy,
Masoch, Miller, Moses...

17:53.230 --> 17:55.753
- Moses?
- Irving Moses, the fruiterer.

17:55.831 --> 17:58.161
Here's Moon. S. Moon.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.527
That's you filed away.

18:01.597 --> 18:04.529
Now then, what would you like
to be first? Prime minister?

18:04.598 --> 18:07.393
Oh, no, I've made that deal already.

18:07.464 --> 18:10.158
Um, I don't know, really.

18:10.231 --> 18:13.164
It's just that I'm not
very good with words.

18:13.232 --> 18:16.597
I didn't have very
much of an education.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.461
And... And I'm a bit, um...

18:20.466 --> 18:22.625
Uh...

18:22.700 --> 18:24.631
Um, I'm just a bit...

18:24.700 --> 18:26.995
Inarticulate?

18:27.066 --> 18:29.125
Yes, that's it... I think.

18:29.201 --> 18:32.632
And you'd like to be the sort of person
who can use words like "inarticulate"?

18:32.700 --> 18:37.259
Yeah! I'd like to be able to talk to
Margaret and tell her how I feel.

18:37.335 --> 18:39.960
An intellectual who can get his
ideas across to the one he loves.

18:40.034 --> 18:42.001
Yes, that's it.
Easily done.

18:42.068 --> 18:45.001
Now then, you just stand
over here by the bird...

18:45.069 --> 18:47.728
put your right hand
on its left claw.

18:47.802 --> 18:50.235
Okay, lights out!

18:51.236 --> 18:53.463
Take this!
Ooh! Ooh!

18:53.536 --> 18:55.468
Am I gonna explode?

18:55.535 --> 18:58.263
No, no, it's quite safe. I just put it
there for a bit of visual excitement.

18:58.336 --> 19:01.063
It's not gonna hurt, is it?
Not a bit.

19:01.135 --> 19:03.126
Hold tight!

19:03.838 --> 19:05.632
The magic words:

19:05.704 --> 19:07.761
Julie Andrews.

19:07.837 --> 19:10.770
I could stand and
watch them for hours.

19:10.838 --> 19:12.827
They've such beautiful hands.
Mmm.

19:12.905 --> 19:15.336
Such fantastic delicacy, you see...

19:15.404 --> 19:20.666
but combined as well with this
almost preternatural strength.

19:20.738 --> 19:24.534
Doesn't it make you sad to see
animals caged up like this?

19:25.705 --> 19:27.638
Well, in a way, but, uh...

19:27.705 --> 19:30.640
quite honestly, they're really
no worse off than most of us.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.639
How do you mean?

19:32.707 --> 19:35.138
Well, metaphorically speaking...

19:35.206 --> 19:37.139
and in a very real sense...

19:37.207 --> 19:39.139
society creates its own cages.

19:39.207 --> 19:41.139
You know, cages of the mind.

19:41.207 --> 19:43.140
Yes. Yes.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.140
A curious kind of
cerebral captivity.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.139
Buy a flower, madam?

19:47.208 --> 19:50.731
Oh! Um, what's it for?
Depraved criminals.

19:50.808 --> 19:53.740
You see, civilization...

19:53.808 --> 19:56.470
has had the effect of...

19:56.543 --> 19:59.008
inhibiting our deepest...

19:59.077 --> 20:01.008
natural animal instincts, you see.

20:01.077 --> 20:03.009
Mmm.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.202
The conventions of an
ordered society...

20:05.277 --> 20:09.766
have made us lose what Freud calls
our urmenschgefuhnaturlichkeit.

20:09.843 --> 20:12.502
Well, it's a bit of a
mouthful, isn't it?

20:12.576 --> 20:15.008
Must have been a marvelous man.

20:15.077 --> 20:17.770
Oh, yes. One of the seminal forces.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.775
Um, as Rousseau said...

20:19.843 --> 20:22.277
we must learn to unlearn...

20:22.346 --> 20:27.277
because only by unlearning
can we really learn to be.

20:27.346 --> 20:29.140
Your ideas are so exciting!

20:29.211 --> 20:31.337
Oh!

20:31.412 --> 20:33.344
What a...

20:33.412 --> 20:35.344
fabulous room!

20:35.412 --> 20:37.345
It's marvelous!
Do you like it?

20:37.413 --> 20:39.571
Oh, I love it.

20:39.646 --> 20:41.577
It's so right.

20:41.646 --> 20:43.578
I mean, it's you!

20:43.647 --> 20:46.840
The moment I walked in,
everything about it says Stanley.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.845
Well...
This room is you.

20:48.913 --> 20:51.347
It's a bit untidy, bit of a mess...

20:51.415 --> 20:54.470
but we bachelors have to fend
for ourselves, you know.

20:54.547 --> 20:56.980
Brahms! I can't believe it!

20:57.049 --> 20:58.980
You too?
Mmm.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.911
Ohh.

21:00.981 --> 21:02.913
Absolutely adore him.
Mmm.

21:02.981 --> 21:04.913
He has a...

21:04.981 --> 21:07.413
virile romanticism that
I find irresistible.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.915
Oh, Brahms is just so fantastic!

21:10.982 --> 21:12.914
Whenever I feel tense or anything...

21:12.982 --> 21:16.973
I put him on, just sprawl on the
carpet and let him flow all over me.

21:17.051 --> 21:19.812
- Would you like a little
taste of him now then?
- Please!

21:19.884 --> 21:21.814
Not that I'm tense or anything.

21:21.882 --> 21:25.146
It's just that it would
make me even less tense.

21:26.384 --> 21:28.373
Mm-hmm.

21:35.718 --> 21:38.151
Mmm!

21:42.319 --> 21:44.308
Go on.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.343
Lie down.

21:48.418 --> 21:49.977
Oh, uh, I didn't mean...

21:50.053 --> 21:52.281
Whew!

21:52.354 --> 21:54.286
Let it happen.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.343
Oh.

22:09.955 --> 22:12.047
Mmm.

22:19.555 --> 22:23.318
I love the way he brings
the flute in there.

22:23.388 --> 22:25.821
That is a French horn, actually.

22:25.889 --> 22:27.821
Oh. How silly of me.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.322
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Goodness gracious.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.652
The French horn can sound
incredibly like a flute, you know.

22:33.724 --> 22:35.656
In fact, not many people notice...

22:35.723 --> 22:38.714
the flute-like qualities
of a French horn.

22:41.623 --> 22:44.056
It's so sensual and evocative.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.057
Mm-hmm.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.057
One can almost see the trees...

22:48.125 --> 22:50.558
and the sunlight dappling through.

22:50.625 --> 22:52.557
And a little brook.

22:52.625 --> 22:54.556
Mmm.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.556
And what's that?

22:56.623 --> 22:58.557
A powerful, young stag...

22:58.624 --> 23:00.489
darts into the clearing...

23:00.560 --> 23:02.889
raises his antlers...

23:02.960 --> 23:05.392
and edges closer to his doe.

23:07.461 --> 23:10.394
Oh, that record was
new this morning.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.859
Where did you get
that fantastic thing?

23:17.928 --> 23:20.860
It is nice, isn't it?

23:20.928 --> 23:22.860
Oh, it's beautiful.

23:22.928 --> 23:25.862
Mmm. I got it off a stall, actually.

23:25.930 --> 23:29.362
Just saw it there
and had to have it.

23:29.428 --> 23:31.361
I'm rather like that, you know.

23:31.428 --> 23:33.361
I see something I want...

23:33.428 --> 23:35.361
and that's it, boy-o.

23:35.428 --> 23:37.362
Have to have it.
Me too.

23:37.429 --> 23:40.089
Yes, you too.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.395
Mmm.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.897
Have a look at it.
Oh, thank you.

23:45.964 --> 23:48.123
Oh!
Bit of a weight, isn't it?

23:48.198 --> 23:50.129
Oh, it's so smooth...

23:50.197 --> 23:52.131
and cool.

23:52.199 --> 23:54.426
Yes, that's the extraordinary
thing about marble.

23:54.498 --> 23:56.429
It's always 11 degrees cooler...

23:56.497 --> 23:58.430
than the air that surrounds it.

23:58.498 --> 24:00.430
Fahrenheit, of course.

24:02.765 --> 24:04.756
Do you like feeling things?

24:06.133 --> 24:09.360
Oh, yes,
I'm a very... tactile person.

24:09.432 --> 24:11.364
I love touching things.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.364
Sometimes...

24:13.433 --> 24:15.364
I go into the forest...

24:15.432 --> 24:17.365
and shut my eyes...

24:17.433 --> 24:21.958
and just wander around touching
trees and grass and boulders.

24:22.035 --> 24:24.593
Y-You should try it.
Do it in here!

24:24.668 --> 24:27.293
Go on. Shut your eyes.

24:33.335 --> 24:35.323
Now feel something hard.

24:36.868 --> 24:38.801
Oh.

24:38.869 --> 24:40.801
Ohh!

24:40.869 --> 24:44.427
Oh, I'm feeling something
terribly hard. It's fantastic.

24:46.003 --> 24:48.628
Oh, now feel something soft.

24:48.703 --> 24:50.829
Oh.

24:50.904 --> 24:54.029
Oh, my goodness gracious me.

24:54.104 --> 24:57.094
Oh, it's unbelievable.

24:58.271 --> 25:00.634
Oh, the contrast.

25:00.705 --> 25:03.635
I've never felt anything
so exciting in my life.

25:03.704 --> 25:07.329
Yeah. I love it. Feel my tie.

25:13.906 --> 25:15.838
Oh!
Mmm.

25:15.906 --> 25:17.839
Oh. It's delicious!

25:17.907 --> 25:19.838
Yeah?
Velvet.

25:19.907 --> 25:21.837
It's so wild.

25:21.906 --> 25:24.428
It really does something to me.

25:24.507 --> 25:26.803
Oh. Uh...
Hmm.

25:28.507 --> 25:31.735
I suppose after all that touching you
could do with something to drink.

25:31.807 --> 25:33.739
Please!
What would you like?

25:33.807 --> 25:36.204
Cinzano.
Cinzano? Fantastic.

25:38.143 --> 25:41.074
One sip of Cinzano,
and I'm in Italy.

25:41.142 --> 25:43.131
Mmm.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.508
The freedom of it.

25:46.576 --> 25:49.007
The sun beating down.
Mmm.

25:49.076 --> 25:53.008
The incredible thing about the Italians
is the way they touch each other.

25:53.076 --> 25:55.633
Have you noticed that?
Yes. Cheers.

25:58.076 --> 26:01.439
The Anglo-Saxons have lost the
art of touching each other.

26:01.509 --> 26:04.443
I mean, if someone wants
to touch somebody else...

26:04.511 --> 26:07.443
then they should go right
ahead and touch them.

26:07.511 --> 26:10.443
I mean, it's a healthy,
human thing to do.

26:10.511 --> 26:12.444
Y-You're so right.

26:12.512 --> 26:15.272
There's a tribe in... in Africa
who never say a word.

26:15.344 --> 26:18.106
They just touch each other.
That's how they communicate.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.110
Life is far too complicated.

26:20.177 --> 26:22.769
I think we should get
down to basic elements.

26:22.846 --> 26:24.539
Mmm.
I mean...

26:24.612 --> 26:28.476
For example, if you
were a girl, and I...

26:28.545 --> 26:31.604
I am a girl.
Well, of course!

26:35.380 --> 26:37.608
All right, but if...
if you were a girl...

26:37.680 --> 26:39.669
which, of course, you are...

26:41.247 --> 26:45.475
and if I were a man, which, for
argument's sake, let's say I am...

26:45.547 --> 26:49.036
and I wanted to touch you, well...

26:49.115 --> 26:51.047
I wouldn't feel restrained.

26:51.115 --> 26:53.047
I mean, I'd just go right ahead...

26:53.115 --> 26:55.172
and...

26:55.248 --> 26:57.180
touch you.

26:57.248 --> 26:59.181
You see? That's how I am.

26:59.249 --> 27:01.112
I feel the same way.

27:01.182 --> 27:04.114
I mean, if two adult human beings
want to touch each other...

27:04.181 --> 27:07.080
they should go ahead
and touch each other.

27:07.150 --> 27:09.139
Why hold back?
Yes.

27:11.751 --> 27:13.683
This afternoon has been...

27:13.751 --> 27:15.682
so perfect.

27:15.751 --> 27:17.443
The Cinzano. The zoo.

27:17.516 --> 27:20.142
The music. The touching.

27:20.217 --> 27:22.651
And you're so right
about the animals.

27:22.718 --> 27:24.878
I mean, that's what we are...

27:24.953 --> 27:28.282
deep down, underneath our
sophisticated civilization...

27:28.352 --> 27:30.783
and we should behave like they do.

27:30.852 --> 27:32.785
Of course.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.785
I mean, the fact that it's...

27:34.853 --> 27:39.047
seven minutes past 3:00 in the afternoon
wouldn't make any difference to a goat.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.848
I mean, Old Billy wouldn't stop to think
what time of day it was, would he?

27:42.920 --> 27:45.886
No, it just goes right ahead
and does what it feels like.

27:45.954 --> 27:48.784
I mean, really, what are
people waiting for?

27:48.854 --> 27:51.251
I want to live!
That's what matters... living.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.617
I want to do everything,
be everything...

27:53.688 --> 27:55.620
feel everything...

27:55.688 --> 27:57.619
Rape! Rape!

27:57.688 --> 27:59.552
No, no! Margaret! Margaret!

27:59.622 --> 28:02.053
The animals! The goats!
The touching!

28:02.122 --> 28:04.053
Rape! Rape! Rape!

28:04.122 --> 28:06.519
What's going on in there? Open the door!

28:06.588 --> 28:08.520
Aah! Ohh! Ooh!

28:08.588 --> 28:10.520
Owwww!

28:12.589 --> 28:14.783
Rape! Aah!

28:16.790 --> 28:19.120
Hello, Stanley.
I won't be a minute.

28:19.190 --> 28:23.179
- Get me down from here.
- You're quite safe.
It's only a 300-foot drop.

28:25.290 --> 28:27.518
What am I doing in this costume?

28:27.591 --> 28:30.113
I thought you ought to
dress for the occasion.

28:30.190 --> 28:32.953
Come on, my darling.
Out you come.

28:33.024 --> 28:35.990
There we are.

28:36.057 --> 28:39.024
What did you say?
I just said...

28:39.092 --> 28:42.057
- What's that mean?
- It's pigeon talk.
I'm just issuing instructions.

28:42.125 --> 28:45.525
I'm going for a double tempt, actually.
Like to come and watch?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.456
- No.
- Come over here.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.458
No need to be frightened.

28:49.526 --> 28:52.459
You won't fall. I'll hold on
to your belt, if you like.

28:52.527 --> 28:54.516
Up you come.

28:56.060 --> 28:57.992
There we are.

28:58.060 --> 29:01.390
Now, you see that man over there?
Yes.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.892
And do you see this pigeon?
Yes.

29:02.959 --> 29:05.392
Well, this is a classic
double tempt situation.

29:05.460 --> 29:07.900
With a bit of luck, I can get
two sins for the price of one...

29:07.962 --> 29:10.860
spite from the perpetrating
pigeon and anger from the victim!

29:10.928 --> 29:12.360
It's terrific!

29:12.430 --> 29:14.861
Are you trying to tell me
you want that pigeon...

29:14.929 --> 29:16.861
to do his doo-dahs
on that man's head?

29:16.929 --> 29:18.861
That's right.

29:18.929 --> 29:20.860
All right, birdie,
remember what I said.

29:20.929 --> 29:22.860
Target in range.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.520
All systems... go!

29:25.597 --> 29:29.529
Release your doo-dahs

29:33.532 --> 29:36.463
What a pathetic thing to do.

29:36.531 --> 29:39.691
If you're the devil, why didn't you
go for that vicar down there?

29:39.766 --> 29:42.196
Oh, no. He's one of ours.

29:42.264 --> 29:44.595
Is this your idea of having fun?

29:44.664 --> 29:46.722
Tempting pigeons?

29:46.799 --> 29:50.127
Banal as it may seem,
Stanley, it is my job.

29:50.198 --> 29:52.631
I don't know.

29:52.700 --> 29:55.028
If it hadn't been for you...

29:55.098 --> 29:59.192
we'd still be blissfully wandering
about naked in paradise.

29:59.266 --> 30:01.198
You're welcome, mate.

30:01.266 --> 30:04.323
The Garden of Eden was a boggy swamp just
south of Croydon. You can see it over there.

30:04.401 --> 30:06.868
Adam and Eve were happy enough.

30:06.933 --> 30:09.695
I'll tell you why...
they were pig ignorant.

30:09.768 --> 30:13.700
Come on, my darling. Out you go,
and do something really nasty.

30:13.768 --> 30:16.199
Oh, how'd you get on
with Margaret Spencer?

30:16.267 --> 30:19.199
I was wondering when
you'd ask me that.

30:19.268 --> 30:22.199
It was terrible.
I was so frustrated.

30:22.267 --> 30:24.700
I had all these words and ideas...

30:24.770 --> 30:27.066
and she listened to them
and agreed with them...

30:27.137 --> 30:29.068
but when I touched her she screamed.

30:29.137 --> 30:31.068
Let me tell you something, Stanley.

30:31.137 --> 30:34.000
As far as sex is concerned,
patience is a virtue.

30:34.069 --> 30:36.194
I wanted her so much
I just couldn't wait.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.668
Let me give you a tip. Come here.

30:38.736 --> 30:41.362
In the words of Marcel Proust...

30:41.437 --> 30:44.232
and this applies to any
woman in the world...

30:44.303 --> 30:47.736
if you can stay up and listen with a fair
degree of attention to whatever garbage...

30:47.805 --> 30:49.736
no matter how stupid it is...

30:49.804 --> 30:51.736
that they're coming out with...

30:51.804 --> 30:54.846
till 10 minutes past 4:00
in the morning, you're in.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.944
Ten minutes past 4:00 in the
morning, and you're there?

30:58.013 --> 30:59.536
It never fails.

31:00.713 --> 31:03.577
Oh, that Margaret's such a...
gorgeous girl.

31:03.647 --> 31:05.135
Isn't she lovely?

31:05.213 --> 31:07.772
I'd like to know what
she's doing right now.

31:07.847 --> 31:10.506
Well, that can be arranged.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.046
Let's just get this out.
What's that?

31:13.114 --> 31:15.046
Galileo's wonderful
little invention.

31:15.114 --> 31:17.102
Have you got sixpence?

31:18.514 --> 31:20.448
Yes.

31:20.515 --> 31:22.505
Have a peer through that.

31:24.315 --> 31:27.077
There we are.
Wha...

31:27.148 --> 31:30.581
Come on, Roberts.
Put your back into it!

31:30.649 --> 31:33.582
It's very good of you to
spend so much time on this.

31:33.650 --> 31:36.582
Shh. Oh, that's why we're here,
Miss Spencer... to help people out.

31:36.650 --> 31:39.081
Or fish people out, rather.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.082
Excuse me, Miss Spencer.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.083
People get the wrong
idea about the police.

31:44.150 --> 31:46.743
We're all human beings
as well, you know.

31:46.818 --> 31:50.750
No, we like the public to
think of us as their friends.

31:50.818 --> 31:52.751
I'm sure we all do, Inspector.

31:52.819 --> 31:55.251
Why don't you call me Reg?

31:55.318 --> 31:58.648
All right, Reg.
And you must call me Margaret.

31:58.718 --> 32:00.911
Here, she told him to
call her Margaret.

32:00.985 --> 32:04.417
I think she fancies him a bit.
Shut up!

32:04.485 --> 32:06.849
Oh, I do hope they don't
find Stanley down there.

32:06.919 --> 32:08.908
He was such a...

32:10.120 --> 32:12.552
Quick, it's run out!
Give me another sixpence.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.609
Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ah! Ooh-ooh!
I haven't got one!

32:14.687 --> 32:16.620
Ohh!

32:16.687 --> 32:19.553
Oh, I know she was gonna say
something nice about me.

32:19.622 --> 32:22.451
Oh, let me have her now.
I must have her now. Please!

32:22.521 --> 32:25.247
Just tell me who, where, when,
under what circumstances.

32:25.320 --> 32:29.549
Margaret is who, of course, but I don't want
to go through courting again... that was awful.

32:29.621 --> 32:32.985
Why not be married to her? Then you'll
be absolutely certain of having her.

32:33.055 --> 32:36.648
Yeah. A-And I'd like to be powerful,
'cause I'd like to give her lots of things.

32:36.723 --> 32:38.655
Rich. Influential. Millionaire.

32:38.723 --> 32:40.655
Multi.
Multi. Good thinking.

32:40.723 --> 32:45.051
Multimillionaire. Yachts, servants,
country estates, a phone in the lav.

32:45.122 --> 32:48.556
Yeah, but I don't want her to be like
she was last time... you know, timid.

32:48.623 --> 32:51.487
I want her to be... physical.

32:51.557 --> 32:53.853
I'll make her very physical,
indeed, for you, Stanley.

32:53.924 --> 32:55.913
Stiffen yourself.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.456
The magic words: Jackie Kennedy!

33:03.225 --> 33:05.088
Oh, well. Julie Andrews.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.616
Randy!

33:17.693 --> 33:19.624
Afternoon, Seed.

33:19.692 --> 33:23.216
Hello, everybody. How are you, Peter?
Sorry I'm late, darling.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.225
Mmm! Hello, Randolph.
Hello.

33:25.293 --> 33:28.227
Brought you a little
something from town.

33:28.294 --> 33:30.227
Do you like it?

33:30.294 --> 33:33.921
Yes. Isn't it lovely, Randy?
Yes.

33:34.995 --> 33:36.925
We're playing croquet.

33:36.993 --> 33:38.925
Why don't you and Peter go away...

33:38.993 --> 33:41.586
and discuss your affairs?

33:41.663 --> 33:43.595
True enough.

33:43.663 --> 33:47.060
I suppose we ought to... tie
up this Venezuelan business.

33:47.130 --> 33:48.719
Yes.

33:48.795 --> 33:52.091
Lord Dowdy, I wonder if you'd be so
kind as to take over my blue ball...

33:52.162 --> 33:53.923
and double up with Daphne.

33:53.995 --> 33:55.927
C-C-C-C-C-Certainly.

33:55.996 --> 33:58.927
Who is that young Randy fellow?
What?

33:58.996 --> 34:00.860
Oh. Randolph.

34:00.931 --> 34:02.863
He's an awfully nice chap.

34:02.931 --> 34:05.362
He's, uh... He's teaching
Margaret the harp.

34:05.431 --> 34:07.363
Oh, yes.

34:07.431 --> 34:09.362
She's terribly artistic, you know.
Is she?

34:09.431 --> 34:11.362
Yes. Terribly.
Artistic?

34:11.431 --> 34:13.362
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

34:13.431 --> 34:16.362
We met Randolph, actually,
when we were in the Bahamas...

34:16.431 --> 34:18.862
forming Margaret's mother
into a limited company.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.864
Very shrewd move.

34:20.933 --> 34:24.864
You ever thought of making Margaret
into a charitable institution?

34:24.933 --> 34:26.866
What a cracking wheeze!

34:26.934 --> 34:29.364
Yes, and then I could get a
depreciation allowance on her.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.864
Exactly. I think the revenue
boys would buy that one.

34:31.933 --> 34:33.866
Yes.

34:33.934 --> 34:36.127
You could probably get her
clothes taken off as well.

34:38.201 --> 34:41.132
Yes, I'm sure they'd be deductible.

34:41.202 --> 34:45.132
Properly handled, I think she could
be a wonderful little asset.

34:45.201 --> 34:47.135
Yes.

34:47.203 --> 34:50.134
I was shopping around for a
wife, actually, the other day.

34:50.202 --> 34:52.134
Mmm. Daphne?

34:52.202 --> 34:54.135
Or something along similar lines.

34:54.203 --> 34:56.793
But my accountant said that in
my bracket it really wasn't on.

34:56.869 --> 34:59.460
Oh, yes... Oh, yes... Come on!

35:00.471 --> 35:03.301
Yes. Excuse me.

35:03.370 --> 35:06.302
I forgot to give you
this, my precious!

35:06.370 --> 35:08.630
Oh, you doll!

35:08.702 --> 35:11.168
There we are. Do you like it?
Oh!

35:11.236 --> 35:13.169
Well!

35:13.237 --> 35:15.601
Feel the fur, Randolph.
Mmm. Beautiful.

35:15.671 --> 35:18.467
How is the old harp...
harp coming along?

35:18.538 --> 35:20.471
Oh, splendidly.

35:20.539 --> 35:22.505
Your wife has extraordinary
sensitivity.

35:22.573 --> 35:24.505
She has, she has. Extraordinary.

35:24.573 --> 35:27.436
Oh, I'm so hot and sticky and...

35:27.505 --> 35:30.495
Randy, we must have a dip!

35:41.874 --> 35:44.600
Your wife has a very beautiful body.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.235
It is nice, isn't it?

35:50.674 --> 35:53.903
You must be a very happy man.

35:55.741 --> 35:58.003
Yes.

35:58.075 --> 36:00.007
Yes, I must be.

36:03.508 --> 36:05.442
I find her...

36:05.509 --> 36:07.839
fantastically attractive.

36:07.909 --> 36:09.966
Hmm.

36:12.477 --> 36:14.410
Thank you.

36:14.478 --> 36:16.409
You don't mind my saying that.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.205
My dear chap. Good Lord.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.435
Not at all. Not at all.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.076
I imagine everybody does.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.441
I imagine they do. Yes.

36:34.712 --> 36:37.644
Sex is a terribly thorny
subject, isn't it?

36:37.712 --> 36:40.269
Mmm. Tsk-tsk-tsk.

36:40.345 --> 36:42.278
Terribly thorny.

36:42.346 --> 36:44.278
Very thorny subject.

36:44.346 --> 36:47.472
I don't really need it.
Yes, please.

36:47.546 --> 36:49.978
I always think it very ironical...

36:50.046 --> 36:54.480
that the male of the species reaches
his sexual peak at the age of 14.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.479
Mmm.

36:56.546 --> 36:58.479
Whereas the appetite
of the female...

36:58.546 --> 37:01.479
continues to increase
with the passing years.

37:02.714 --> 37:04.646
Yes.

37:04.714 --> 37:06.646
Hmm.

37:06.714 --> 37:09.204
It is ironic, isn't it?

37:10.882 --> 37:12.814
Bloody ironic.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.974
Ah.

37:16.515 --> 37:19.674
Of course, monogamy isn't a
natural state for any animal.

37:19.747 --> 37:21.681
Good Lord, no.

37:21.748 --> 37:23.681
Goodness gracious, no. No.

37:23.748 --> 37:26.682
When I say "animal," I mean man.
Yes.

37:26.749 --> 37:29.683
- And when I say "man," I mean woman, of course.
- Of course.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.682
You see, he... or,
for that matter, she...

37:34.750 --> 37:36.682
is, um...

37:36.749 --> 37:38.807
fundamentally promiscuous.

37:38.884 --> 37:40.849
Now.

37:41.852 --> 37:44.443
Yes.

37:44.518 --> 37:46.814
Yes, she probably is.

37:46.885 --> 37:49.476
How does that feel?

37:50.854 --> 37:52.784
Excuse me.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.785
Darling! Darling!
Mmm?

37:54.854 --> 37:56.785
I forgot to give you
this, dear heart.

37:56.854 --> 37:58.785
How exciting. What is it?

38:00.353 --> 38:03.081
Boo-boo-boo-boo!
You shouldn't have.

38:03.154 --> 38:06.586
Is it the original?
Yes. I thought it might appeal.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.484
Thank you, dear. You are sweet.

38:09.553 --> 38:11.485
Oh, good!

38:11.552 --> 38:14.486
And now we must go and get
out of our wet things.

38:14.553 --> 38:17.645
Come along, Randy.

38:19.421 --> 38:23.116
Beautiful collection of books
you've got here, Stanley.

38:23.189 --> 38:25.655
Must be worth a packet.

38:25.722 --> 38:28.655
Yes, I caught a rather nasty
cold in blue chips last week...

38:28.723 --> 38:32.246
and my broker's advised me
to switch to first editions.

38:32.323 --> 38:34.084
They're going up all the time.

38:34.156 --> 38:36.088
Yes.

38:36.157 --> 38:39.680
That one's worth about £10 more
than it was when we came in.

38:39.756 --> 38:45.123
Forgive my ignorance,
B-B-B-Bagshot...

38:45.192 --> 38:48.124
b-but what are y-y-y-you in?

38:48.192 --> 38:50.986
Missiles and munitions, mainly.

38:51.058 --> 38:53.149
Mmm.
How's the market holding up?

38:53.225 --> 38:57.658
Well, we've been very badly
hit by this peace scare.

38:58.959 --> 39:01.289
We fell four points yesterday.

39:02.593 --> 39:04.524
Luckily, I managed to off-load...

39:04.593 --> 39:06.854
a lot of obsolete rubbish...

39:06.925 --> 39:08.915
on the freedom fighters.

39:10.526 --> 39:12.857
Yet things still look rather dodgy.

39:12.927 --> 39:15.620
S-S-S-Surely i-i-i-i-it's...

39:15.694 --> 39:19.820
only a t-t-t-temporary...

39:19.894 --> 39:22.793
s-s-s-s-setback.

39:22.862 --> 39:26.294
That's very easy for you
to say, Lord Dowdy.

39:26.359 --> 39:28.294
But it only takes two lunatics...

39:28.361 --> 39:30.792
to sit down and sign
a piece of paper...

39:30.862 --> 39:34.487
and we could be plunged into a
nuclear peace so devastating...

39:34.561 --> 39:37.494
that my company, for one, would
be wiped out completely.

39:37.563 --> 39:40.687
Where's that harp coming from?

39:40.762 --> 39:43.729
It's probably Margaret
playing with Randolph...

39:43.796 --> 39:46.126
in the music room.

39:46.196 --> 39:48.128
They're very good
together, aren't they?

39:48.197 --> 39:50.629
Yes, they certainly are.

39:50.697 --> 39:55.426
I often wish I'd been forced to take up
an instrument myself when I was young.

39:55.498 --> 39:58.429
I must say, I, uh, admire the way...

39:58.498 --> 40:00.429
you allow her such freedom.

40:00.497 --> 40:03.430
I think most husbands would
object to their wives...

40:03.498 --> 40:06.727
being alone in a room
with a handsome...

40:06.799 --> 40:09.288
virile young man.

40:12.365 --> 40:15.800
Well, it is the 20th
century, after all, old boy.

40:15.867 --> 40:19.354
Can't expect to possess
anyone body and soul.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.932
Huh.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.932
Wonder why the...

40:26.000 --> 40:27.933
music stopped.

40:28.001 --> 40:31.264
They've probably come to the
end of their first movement.

40:31.335 --> 40:33.267
Your shot, Stanley.

40:33.335 --> 40:35.268
Yes. Yes.

40:35.336 --> 40:37.528
Um... Ah-ta-ta-ta.

40:37.603 --> 40:42.035
Uh, l-l-I'll just pop
along and, uh, uh...

40:42.102 --> 40:45.034
see if they need
anything before, uh...

40:45.102 --> 40:49.126
they start their, um, next...

40:49.203 --> 40:52.134
movement.

40:57.227 --> 40:59.089
Oh.

40:59.159 --> 41:01.092
Uh, hello, Randolph.

41:01.159 --> 41:04.093
Have you seen anything
of my wife at all?

41:04.160 --> 41:06.591
Not recently.
I thought she was with you.

41:07.826 --> 41:10.258
Yes. Probably is. Probably is, yes.

41:11.261 --> 41:13.193
Yes.

41:13.260 --> 41:16.317
Probably... with...

41:16.394 --> 41:18.383
Probably with me.

41:22.130 --> 41:24.857
Oh. Um, where's Peter got to?

41:24.929 --> 41:27.792
H-H-He said s-s-s...

41:27.862 --> 41:31.795
s-s-something had
c-c-c-c... come up.

41:31.863 --> 41:33.794
Come up?
Something come up? Yes.

41:33.862 --> 41:35.795
Y-Y-Your sh-shot.

41:35.863 --> 41:38.420
My shot. Yes. Yes, my shot.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.428
Yes, you're certainly right there.

41:40.496 --> 41:42.428
Gosh. My shot. Yes.

41:42.497 --> 41:44.428
Oh, blast!

41:44.497 --> 41:47.760
Gosh.
Seem to have broken me cue.

41:47.831 --> 41:50.094
Um... won't use any of those.

41:50.166 --> 41:52.097
Rubbishy old things.

41:52.165 --> 41:54.595
I'll just... just go and
get my special one.

41:54.663 --> 41:58.391
Um, Margaret'll know where
to lay her hands on it!

41:58.464 --> 42:01.328
Margaret, my darling! My precious!

42:01.398 --> 42:03.695
My sweet? My love? Margaret!

42:05.166 --> 42:07.098
Seed!
Sir?

42:07.166 --> 42:10.495
Oh. Uh, have you seen
Lady Margaret, Seed?

42:10.565 --> 42:12.828
Her Ladyship is in
the bathroom, sir.

42:12.900 --> 42:15.833
In the bathroom, Seed.
Jolly good.

42:20.734 --> 42:22.791
Oh. Hello, Peter. Hello, darling.

42:22.869 --> 42:24.801
Uh, s...

42:24.869 --> 42:27.800
sorry to butt in like this, Peter...

42:27.867 --> 42:30.390
but, um, uh...

42:30.467 --> 42:33.025
about this Venezuelan business...

42:33.101 --> 42:36.829
I thought we ought to get it, uh,
tied up one way or the other.

42:36.902 --> 42:39.960
Um, uh...

42:40.035 --> 42:42.969
do you want me to come
in with you on it...

42:43.036 --> 42:45.969
or, um, do you...
do you wish to pull out...

42:46.036 --> 42:49.434
or shall we just call
the whole thing, um...

42:52.137 --> 42:54.262
Aaah!

42:54.337 --> 42:57.269
Hello, Stanley.
Just tap this for me, would you?

42:57.337 --> 42:59.860
What are we doing up here?
Trapping a few wasps.

42:59.937 --> 43:03.199
Wasps? Blimey!
Come on, my darlings.

43:03.271 --> 43:06.704
Come on, my beastlies.
Out of the nest, into the jar. Come on.

43:06.772 --> 43:10.204
How'd it go, Stanley?
You know perfectly well how it went.

43:10.272 --> 43:13.203
That Bagshot bloke
looked exactly like you.

43:13.272 --> 43:15.203
Well, there's a lot
of me in everyone.

43:15.271 --> 43:18.568
It was even worse than the last time.
I've never been so miserable.

43:18.639 --> 43:21.571
Wasn't she physical enough?
She was physical, all right.

43:21.639 --> 43:23.571
She was too physical.

43:23.639 --> 43:26.071
She was physical all over
the place, except with me.

43:26.139 --> 43:29.402
Oh, don't be too hard on her.
Fornication's such a puny sin.

43:29.473 --> 43:31.531
What she did to me
was unforgivable.

43:31.608 --> 43:34.540
You're just like all my clients.
Absolutely typical.

43:34.608 --> 43:37.541
If Margaret had come in and told
you she'd murdered the gardener...

43:37.609 --> 43:40.541
you'd have forgiven her,
shielded her from the police.

43:40.609 --> 43:43.540
Just because she has a bit of
harmless fun with some young man...

43:43.609 --> 43:45.540
doesn't do anybody any damage...

43:45.609 --> 43:47.540
you want to strangle her.

43:47.608 --> 43:49.599
You're a complete hypocrite.

43:49.676 --> 43:51.607
I thought you were
gonna make me happy.

43:51.676 --> 43:54.607
I never promised you that.
That's up to you.

43:54.675 --> 43:57.769
I just gave you seven wishes
for one measly little soul.

43:57.844 --> 44:00.002
I'm only doing me job.
Your job?

44:00.076 --> 44:01.906
Making people miserable?

44:01.977 --> 44:05.671
No! Giving them the chance
to be happy. It's God's idea.

44:06.743 --> 44:08.676
Don't confuse me with religion.

44:08.743 --> 44:11.677
You see, his theory...
and I'm not knocking it...

44:11.745 --> 44:14.677
is that in order for people
to be really good...

44:14.745 --> 44:18.506
they have to make a free choice between
good and evil and choose good.

44:18.578 --> 44:20.202
Look.

44:21.911 --> 44:25.106
I'm a vital part of his plan.
I provide the evil.

44:29.479 --> 44:31.412
Wasps!

44:31.480 --> 44:33.378
Wasps! Wasps!

44:35.446 --> 44:38.879
Oh, you rotten,
nasty-minded troublemaker.

44:38.947 --> 44:40.878
Ohh!

44:40.947 --> 44:43.708
Those nice, gentle flower people
grooving along quietly...

44:43.781 --> 44:45.713
and you had to mess it up.

44:45.781 --> 44:48.269
You could do something about it.
How?

44:48.347 --> 44:51.247
Why don't you give them
one of your wishes?

44:53.416 --> 44:56.348
Well, because they're mine, and
I've only got five of 'em left.

44:56.416 --> 44:59.211
Not falling for any more of your
tricks, thank you very much.

44:59.282 --> 45:02.714
Well, just as you like.
Let's go. More work to be done.

45:05.817 --> 45:07.749
What a dreary thing to do.

45:07.817 --> 45:09.750
I hope you're proud of yourself.

45:09.818 --> 45:11.750
It was pride that got me into this.

45:11.818 --> 45:14.748
I used to be an angel,
you know, up in heaven.

45:14.817 --> 45:17.750
- Oh, yeah. You used to be
God's favorite, didn't you?
- That's right.

45:17.819 --> 45:21.841
"I Love Lucifer" it was, in those days.
What was it like in heaven?

45:21.918 --> 45:23.975
Very nice, really.

45:24.051 --> 45:26.677
We used to sit around
all day and adore him.

45:26.752 --> 45:28.843
Believe me, he was adorable.

45:28.919 --> 45:31.851
Just about the most adorable
thing you ever did see.

45:31.919 --> 45:34.384
Well, what went wrong then?
I'll show you.

45:34.452 --> 45:38.077
Here we are.
Give me a leg up, would you?

45:38.152 --> 45:40.085
Now, then...

45:40.152 --> 45:42.086
I'm God.

45:42.153 --> 45:44.087
This is my throne, see.

45:44.154 --> 45:46.086
All around me are the
cherubim, seraphim...

45:46.154 --> 45:48.086
continually crying,"Holy,
holy, holy"...

45:48.154 --> 45:50.086
the angels, archangels,
that sort of thing.

45:50.154 --> 45:53.746
Now you be me, Lucifer, the
loveliest angel of them all.

45:53.821 --> 45:57.083
- What do I do?
- Well, sort of dance around
praising me, mainly.

45:57.154 --> 46:00.019
- What sort of things do I say?
- Anything that comes into
your head that's nice.

46:00.088 --> 46:03.714
How beautiful I am, how wise, how
handsome, that sort of thing.

46:03.789 --> 46:05.915
Come on. Start dancing.

46:07.523 --> 46:10.421
You're wise, you're
beautiful You're handsome

46:10.489 --> 46:12.421
Thank you very much.

46:12.489 --> 46:14.079
The universe

46:14.157 --> 46:16.588
- What a wonderful idea.
Take my hat off to you.
- Thank you.

46:16.657 --> 46:20.089
Trees, terrific.
Water, another good one.

46:20.157 --> 46:23.089
That was a good one.
Yes! Sex... top marks.

46:23.157 --> 46:25.783
Now make it more personal.
A bit more fulsome, please.

46:25.857 --> 46:28.186
Come on.
Immortal, invisible.

46:28.257 --> 46:31.190
You're handsome, you're,
uh, you're glorious.

46:31.258 --> 46:33.189
Thank you. More!

46:33.258 --> 46:35.190
You're the most beautiful
person in the world

46:35.259 --> 46:39.123
Here, I'm getting a bit bored with this.
Can't we change places?

46:39.192 --> 46:41.317
That's exactly how I felt.

46:42.326 --> 46:44.258
I only wanted to be like him...

46:44.326 --> 46:46.257
and have a few angels adoring me.

46:46.324 --> 46:50.258
He didn't see it like that.
Pride, he called it. Sin of pride.

46:50.326 --> 46:55.917
Flew into a monumental rage, chucked me
out of heaven, gave me this miserable job.

46:55.993 --> 46:57.925
Just 'cause I wanted to be loved.

46:57.994 --> 47:00.859
I had no idea.
It's a very sad story.

47:00.927 --> 47:02.860
I suppose he had his reasons.

47:02.927 --> 47:04.860
Oh, can't you stop?

47:04.927 --> 47:06.860
It's a compulsion!

47:06.927 --> 47:09.519
I'm compelled to. His orders.
Pathetic.

47:09.595 --> 47:12.425
He moves in a very
mysterious way, you know.

47:16.829 --> 47:19.420
Here, that's terrible!

47:19.496 --> 47:23.086
But apart from the way he
moves, what's God really like?

47:23.162 --> 47:25.094
I mean, what color is he?

47:25.163 --> 47:27.095
He's all colors of the rainbow...
many-hued.

47:27.164 --> 47:29.924
But he is English, isn't he?
Oh, yes. Very upper-class.

47:32.930 --> 47:36.192
Course his son had a lot of problems,
having such a famous father.

47:36.264 --> 47:39.697
I always felt sorry for Jesus having
his birthday on Christmas Day.

47:39.764 --> 47:41.753
Just one lot of presents.

47:49.930 --> 47:52.363
That's a bad day's work.

47:52.433 --> 47:54.365
Oh, no. He's in here again.

47:54.433 --> 47:57.366
Come on, Vanity, you
worthless old sin!

47:57.434 --> 48:01.024
Stop preening! Get back and
tidy up your men's room!

48:10.199 --> 48:12.758
How could he see where he's going?
He can't.

48:14.833 --> 48:18.767
What rotten sins I've got working for me.
I suppose it's the wages.

48:18.833 --> 48:20.768
Anyway, enough of my problems.

48:20.835 --> 48:22.768
Sit down.
Thank you.

48:22.835 --> 48:25.769
You must be exhausted after all
that business with Margaret.

48:25.836 --> 48:28.302
Jealousy really takes it
out of you, doesn't it?

48:28.369 --> 48:31.302
Think things over before you
decide on your next wish.

48:31.370 --> 48:34.302
Don't rush into it.
Have a bit of kip.

48:34.370 --> 48:36.800
Things'll seem clearer
in the morning.

48:36.868 --> 48:39.892
You can use my bed if you like.

48:39.969 --> 48:41.900
Slip into this.

48:41.969 --> 48:44.094
Oh. Where will you sleep then?

48:44.170 --> 48:46.764
Oh, don't worry about me.
I never do.

48:46.838 --> 48:49.770
I had a fitful doze in the Middle Ages.
Since then, nothing.

48:49.838 --> 48:52.827
- Go on. You can change through there.
- Thank you.

48:54.838 --> 48:59.601
It's very kind of you to lend me
your room and your bed like this.

48:59.672 --> 49:02.604
You're the first person who's
ever shown any concern for me...

49:02.672 --> 49:04.605
and you're the devil.

49:04.673 --> 49:07.696
I mean, God's never taken any
interest in me, as far as I can see.

49:07.772 --> 49:11.228
Of course not. He never pushes himself
forward. Prefers to work subliminally.

49:11.307 --> 49:14.238
It's the oldest trick in the
game, your soft-sell technique.

49:14.307 --> 49:17.205
Well, I wish he would push himself
forward and help people a bit...

49:17.274 --> 49:19.207
and prove he was there.

49:19.275 --> 49:21.206
Well, in God's view,
for what it's worth...

49:21.275 --> 49:23.206
this would interfere with
your freedom of choice.

49:23.275 --> 49:25.207
Freedom of choice?

49:25.276 --> 49:28.708
What sort of freedom of choice did
I have about where I was born...

49:28.774 --> 49:30.706
and what size I was...

49:30.773 --> 49:33.707
and what a bloody awful
job I landed myself in?

49:33.774 --> 49:36.706
If we really had
freedom of choice...

49:36.774 --> 49:40.901
we should be able to decide who are parents
are, what we look like and everything.

49:40.975 --> 49:45.238
- I couldn't agree more.
- Then why the hell doesn't he
do something about it?

49:45.310 --> 49:47.367
God knows.

49:47.445 --> 49:49.965
Well, that's very
handsome, I must say.

49:50.042 --> 49:52.203
- It's a bit long.
- Suits you down to the ground.

49:52.277 --> 49:54.266
Looks very good on you.

49:54.343 --> 49:57.275
Actually, um, red's
not really my color.

49:57.343 --> 49:59.537
I'm normally a bit
more conservative.

49:59.610 --> 50:01.543
But it's very nice though.

50:01.610 --> 50:03.600
In you get.

50:07.777 --> 50:09.970
You know, Mr. Spiggott...

50:10.044 --> 50:13.704
you're really the first person who's
ever taken the trouble to talk to me.

50:13.778 --> 50:15.711
I like you...

50:15.778 --> 50:18.712
but you keep on doing
these terrible things.

50:18.779 --> 50:20.768
It's nothing personal.

50:22.380 --> 50:25.642
Well, if you say so.
Good night, Stanley.

50:25.712 --> 50:28.474
Good night, Mr. Spiggott.
Call me George.

50:30.381 --> 50:32.371
Oh. Good night, George.

50:46.981 --> 50:48.947
Good...

50:50.615 --> 50:53.480
morning, Mr. Moon.

50:53.550 --> 50:57.642
- Morning?
- I've brought y'all somethin'.

51:01.051 --> 51:04.243
To eat.
Thank you.

51:10.184 --> 51:12.117
It's so hot in here.

51:12.185 --> 51:14.175
Whew!

51:17.552 --> 51:20.484
Would you, uh, help
me with my buttons?

51:20.552 --> 51:23.542
I seem to be all
thumbs this mornin'.

51:30.153 --> 51:32.086
Oh!

51:32.154 --> 51:35.881
I find clothes so constrictin'.

51:35.954 --> 51:39.386
We must allow our pores to breathe.

51:40.853 --> 51:43.717
That's better!

51:45.254 --> 51:47.482
Can you hear my pores breathe?

51:48.988 --> 51:50.957
Listen.

51:51.090 --> 51:53.955
Would you like a nibble?

51:54.024 --> 51:56.682
Why, you must be ravenous.

51:58.124 --> 52:00.489
Would you like orange juice?

52:00.558 --> 52:02.387
Um...

52:02.457 --> 52:04.389
Or...

52:04.457 --> 52:07.946
a succulent, sun-ripe, whole...

52:08.026 --> 52:10.548
pineapple?

52:10.624 --> 52:14.114
But you have to be
careful of the prickles.

52:14.192 --> 52:18.387
Oh, I will.
Do you like it in bed?

52:18.460 --> 52:20.721
Uh, uh, yes.

52:20.793 --> 52:23.917
Good. So do I!

52:27.028 --> 52:29.016
Look up there.

52:30.626 --> 52:34.115
Don't we make a pretty pair?
Yes.

52:34.193 --> 52:37.353
Coffee?
Um, yes.

52:37.427 --> 52:41.986
Strong, black and sweet.

52:42.062 --> 52:45.223
Two mountainous spoons full.

52:48.796 --> 52:51.556
Hot toast or buttered buns?

52:53.095 --> 52:58.028
- Either.
- Oh, I love a man who knows what he wants.

52:58.095 --> 53:01.460
Do you crave marmalade or honey?

53:03.197 --> 53:05.186
Honey.

53:09.098 --> 53:11.029
Ohh!

53:11.097 --> 53:16.189
I do so love the smell of
honey on a man's lips.

53:16.264 --> 53:19.198
Come on now, Lily.

53:19.265 --> 53:21.391
Up you get.

53:21.466 --> 53:24.954
Pick your clothes up. You're due
down at the Foreign Office.

53:31.631 --> 53:33.861
Good-bye, Mr. Moon.

53:33.934 --> 53:36.923
Let's get together soon.

53:38.567 --> 53:40.467
Um, who was that?

53:40.533 --> 53:44.126
Didn't she introduce herself? That's
Lilian Lust, the babe with the bust.

53:44.201 --> 53:47.326
Oh. She's quite nice, really.

53:47.402 --> 53:50.696
She's a very sweet, warm, wonderful
human being. I'll say that for her.

53:50.767 --> 53:53.929
Mmm. You know, I...

53:54.002 --> 53:56.967
You're quite right. I do see things
much more clearly this morning.

53:57.035 --> 53:58.797
Thought you would.

53:58.869 --> 54:02.734
I was... thinking about that girl Lilian.
You know, she's...

54:02.804 --> 54:05.132
Shh! Stanley.

54:05.202 --> 54:07.691
I wouldn't mess around with
married women if I were you.

54:07.770 --> 54:10.259
Oh. She married?
Yes. Tragic business.

54:10.336 --> 54:13.395
Completely incompatible.
You met the husband... Sloth.

54:13.470 --> 54:15.561
So that's it then? She's out?
Afraid so.

54:17.171 --> 54:20.898
But can I... can I be
someone who women...

54:20.971 --> 54:23.868
yearn after and crave
for and lust after?

54:23.937 --> 54:26.167
You'd like to be young
and sexy and dynamic...

54:26.239 --> 54:28.705
and have beautiful women hurl
themselves at your feet.

54:28.772 --> 54:31.761
Yeah, that's it. But most of
all, it's gotta be Margaret.

54:31.838 --> 54:33.964
I want Margaret lusting after me.

54:34.040 --> 54:37.200
I'll tell you what people go mad for
these days. That's your pop stars.

54:37.273 --> 54:41.500
I can just see you, Stanley, standing
there in your skintight pants...

54:41.573 --> 54:45.869
the music pounding, the women
screaming, Margaret laughing...

54:45.940 --> 54:49.736
the drums throbbing out with
their incessant animal beat!

54:49.807 --> 54:54.502
Let me have it!
Julie Andrews!

55:11.741 --> 55:13.732
Oh, Stanley!

55:18.709 --> 55:20.642
Stanley!

55:25.144 --> 55:26.838
Oh!

55:30.477 --> 55:33.206
I love you, Stanley!

56:22.115 --> 56:24.048
Oh, Stanley!

56:38.284 --> 56:41.149
Oh!

56:43.618 --> 56:48.279
And now, this year's most
exciting discovery...

56:48.352 --> 56:51.250
Drimble Wedge and the Vegetation!

59:00.998 --> 59:03.463
Oh!
Oh, hello, Stanley.

59:03.531 --> 59:07.191
Nice to have you back so soon.
I won't be a moment.

59:07.265 --> 59:10.096
Hello. You've just cut me off.
I was talking to Tokyo.

59:12.432 --> 59:16.196
Do you really love me?
Of course I do, you jerk!
Get off my line!

59:16.267 --> 59:19.254
I thought you were
supposed to be my friend.

59:19.333 --> 59:21.266
All that talk.

59:21.334 --> 59:23.663
Your bed and that
girl this morning.

59:23.733 --> 59:27.427
You just put her there to get me all excited
and confused so I'd make the wrong decision.

59:27.500 --> 59:29.762
What happened?
What happened.

59:29.834 --> 59:32.322
It finished before it started.
That's what happened.

59:32.400 --> 59:37.059
They're like that these days, your
pop fans, aren't they? Very fickle.

59:37.132 --> 59:39.395
Mrs. Fitch?
Speaking.

59:39.467 --> 59:42.629
Abercrombie here.
I work with your husband.
Oh, yes?

59:42.703 --> 59:46.862
I thought you'd like to know he's just checked
in to the Cheeseborough Hotel, Brighton...

59:46.935 --> 59:48.869
with his secretary, Fiona.

59:48.936 --> 59:53.766
- Good-bye.
- What a putrid thing to do.

59:53.836 --> 59:56.495
Why did I get myself
into such a mess?

59:56.569 --> 59:59.626
Let me answer that by
asking you a question.

59:59.703 --> 01:00:03.602
In the words of the great
Zen master, Li Kwi Kwat...

01:00:03.669 --> 01:00:06.499
"If you were hanging from a
cliff by your fingernails...

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:10.629
"and above you was a raging
tiger baring his fangs...

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:13.693
"and below you was the tiger's
mate, baring her fangs...

01:00:13.771 --> 01:00:15.704
what would you do?"

01:00:15.772 --> 01:00:18.100
What a stupid question!

01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:22.195
Cliffs and tigers. I wouldn't get myself
into such a ridiculous situation.

01:00:22.272 --> 01:00:25.432
Oh, of course not.
You've got the secret.

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:27.495
You're far better off.

01:00:27.574 --> 01:00:30.198
Here you are, halfway up
a pole in Berkshire...

01:00:30.273 --> 01:00:33.968
damned in the hereafter for
eternity, half your wishes gone.

01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:37.700
You've nothing to learn from Li Kwi
Kwat and his tigers, have you?

01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:42.000
Hello. Mrs. Phelps?
Hello. Yes?

01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:44.131
Mrs.Jonathan Phelps?
Yes.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.801
Mrs.Jonathan Phelps of 8 Puseley
Rise, Hounslow, Middlesex?

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:48.461
Yes.

01:00:48.487 --> 01:00:50.831
Did I get you out of the
bath to answer the phone?

01:00:50.874 --> 01:00:54.204
Yes, you did.
Sorry. Wrong number.

01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:58.837
Your tricks are so bloomin' dismal.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:01.706
I know, Stanley. Don't rub it in.

01:01:01.777 --> 01:01:03.800
I've lost me spark.

01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:06.365
There was a time when I
used to get lots of ideas.

01:01:06.443 --> 01:01:09.171
I was creative, original.

01:01:09.243 --> 01:01:11.936
I thought up the seven deadly
sins in one afternoon.

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.568
The only thing I've come up
with recently is advertising.

01:01:15.644 --> 01:01:18.974
Blimey! We're due at Mrs. Wisby's.
Hurry up. Let's get changed.

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:22.533
You're so dull, the way
you go about things.

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.100
Everything you do is third-rate.

01:01:25.178 --> 01:01:27.667
Pass me over me britches.
There's a good chap.

01:01:27.746 --> 01:01:32.508
"Pass me my britches." The Prince of Darkness
changing his britches in a G.P.O. van.

01:01:32.579 --> 01:01:36.033
What's the matter with you? Where's
your style? Use your magic powers.

01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:40.409
I daren't waste those. I've got to save
all that up for my struggle with him.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.504
I thought you were
supposed to be his equal.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.738
Huh! That'll be the day.

01:01:44.813 --> 01:01:47.370
For a start, he's omnipresent.
What do you mean?

01:01:47.446 --> 01:01:51.106
I only mean he's everywhere, all
over the world, at the same time.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.113
That's all I mean.
I'm just highly maneuverable.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.978
So he's in here right now.
Of course he is.

01:01:57.048 --> 01:01:59.310
He's in the van. He's in the can.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.645
He's up the trees.
He's in the breeze.

01:02:01.716 --> 01:02:03.841
He's in your hair. He's everywhere.

01:02:03.916 --> 01:02:07.176
Spying on you, peering at you,
listening to everything you say.

01:02:07.247 --> 01:02:11.340
There's no privacy for anyone. Get out
of here while I'm changing, can't you?

01:02:11.415 --> 01:02:13.847
You won't get anywhere by
shouting at him, you know.

01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:18.350
You're quite right, of course.
I'll try the humble approach.

01:02:18.417 --> 01:02:21.007
Excuse me, Your
Ineffable Hugeness.

01:02:21.084 --> 01:02:24.073
I wonder if you'd be gracious enough
to step outside for a moment...

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:26.708
while we miserable worms
get our drawers on.

01:02:26.783 --> 01:02:29.716
I can't say you sounded
very sincere, mate.

01:02:31.584 --> 01:02:33.915
Here! What's your game?

01:02:33.985 --> 01:02:38.059
I wanted to give him a bit of a turn.
I saw him nestling in your trousers.

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:47.883
Good afternoon, madam.
We're the Froony Green Eyewash men.

01:02:47.959 --> 01:02:51.484
Have you, by any chance, got 10 bottles
of Froony Green Eyewash in your house?

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.390
Oh, no. I'm afraid I haven't.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.687
Oh, what a pity, 'cause if you had
and could answer a simple question...

01:02:57.759 --> 01:03:00.247
you'd have won a beautiful
silver tea service...

01:03:00.327 --> 01:03:02.817
and a night on the town
with Alfred Hitchcock.

01:03:02.895 --> 01:03:04.793
Oh, what a shame.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.349
Never mind.
Look, I'll tell you what.

01:03:08.429 --> 01:03:10.418
Nobody will ever
know the difference.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:15.292
Why don't you nip down to the shops,
buy 10 bottles of Froony Green Eyewash...

01:03:15.363 --> 01:03:17.692
come back here as
quickly as you can...

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:20.124
and I'll pretend you
had them all the time.

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:23.162
You're very kind.
Hurry back now.

01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:27.992
Let's get something to eat.

01:03:28.064 --> 01:03:30.428
Let's see what we've got.
Very nice.

01:03:30.497 --> 01:03:34.155
Raspberries, cream, sugar.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:38.890
Ideal combination for a
lovely summer afternoon.

01:03:41.197 --> 01:03:43.187
Oh, leave her a few.

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:45.254
I need them more than she does.

01:03:45.332 --> 01:03:47.264
I'm so depressed.

01:03:47.332 --> 01:03:50.492
This job, it's really
getting me down.

01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:54.223
What have you... What have you
got to be depressed about?

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:56.287
I mean, look on the bright side.

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:59.990
Think of all your successes.
Sodom and Gomorrah.

01:04:00.065 --> 01:04:02.761
Short-lived, Stanley. Short-lived.

01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:05.527
Besides, as soon as I get a
really swinging scene going...

01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:08.999
he butts in with his
fire and brimstone.

01:04:09.068 --> 01:04:12.124
He's a very destructive,
unpredictable person.

01:04:12.199 --> 01:04:14.928
Is that why you can't insure
against acts of God?

01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:19.400
Exactly. As if that isn't enough, I've got
last-minute repentance to contend with.

01:04:19.467 --> 01:04:22.799
- That doesn't sound too much of a threat.
- Not much of a threat?

01:04:22.868 --> 01:04:26.197
Do you realize I can spend 50
or 60 years working on a client...

01:04:26.268 --> 01:04:29.758
making him vain, greedy,
lustful, slothful, the lot...

01:04:29.836 --> 01:04:33.132
and then just when he's breathing his
last, he goes and bloody repents?

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.499
- I lost Mussolini that way.
- Really?

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:39.730
At the moment they're putting the noose around
his neck, he says, "Scusi. Mille regrette."

01:04:39.804 --> 01:04:41.736
Up he goes. Psst!

01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:48.661
Here they are. Ten bottles
of Froony's Green Eyewash.

01:04:48.737 --> 01:04:50.726
I just got in before they closed.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.894
Well done, Mrs. Wisby.

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:56.497
Now all you have to do is answer
one very simple question.

01:04:56.573 --> 01:04:58.504
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:04:58.573 --> 01:05:00.595
How tall is the Duke of Edinburgh?

01:05:00.672 --> 01:05:03.138
Oh, dear.

01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:07.501
Let me see. I saw it somewhere.
Six foot one, is it?

01:05:07.572 --> 01:05:09.970
Alas, no.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.528
The correct answer
is six foot two...

01:05:12.607 --> 01:05:15.301
and this means you've lost £10.

01:05:15.374 --> 01:05:18.066
Terribly sorry, Mrs. Wisby.
Better luck next time.

01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:20.798
Come on, Stanley. Off we go.

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:23.897
Good-bye!

01:05:23.975 --> 01:05:26.702
That poor old lady.
How can you be so mean?

01:05:26.773 --> 01:05:29.105
That grasping, greedy old bag?

01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:31.573
She didn't mind the idea
of cheating Froony's.

01:05:31.642 --> 01:05:34.631
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you
something about Margaret Spencer.

01:05:34.709 --> 01:05:37.437
What's that?
She's dead.

01:05:37.509 --> 01:05:39.565
- No, she's not.
- No, she's not.

01:05:39.643 --> 01:05:41.972
She's not?
No, she's alive.

01:05:42.043 --> 01:05:44.008
Then why did you say that?

01:05:44.075 --> 01:05:47.270
Malice. I'm a liar. I do it the
whole time. I can't help it.

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:50.139
Are you telling me that everything
you've ever said is a lie?

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:53.006
Everything I've ever told you
has been a lie, including that.

01:05:53.078 --> 01:05:55.942
- Including what?
- That everything I've ever
told you has been a lie.

01:05:56.011 --> 01:05:57.943
That's not true.

01:05:58.011 --> 01:06:01.067
I don't know what to believe.
Not me, Stanley. Believe me.

01:06:03.445 --> 01:06:07.275
Listen, you tell me one
thing, and it better be true.

01:06:07.344 --> 01:06:10.072
What is Margaret Spencer
doing right now?

01:06:11.144 --> 01:06:13.076
Scout's honor, Stanley.

01:06:13.144 --> 01:06:15.442
She's with that powerfully
built Inspector Clark.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:19.001
She's very concerned about you.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.842
Oh, I'd like to be in the room with them.
Wish I was a fly on the wall.

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.811
Julie Andrews!
You rotten bas...

01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:26.811
You've tricked me again!

01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:28.811
That wasn't meant to be a wish!

01:06:28.879 --> 01:06:31.846
I only did what you said.
Blow a raspberry.

01:06:31.914 --> 01:06:33.846
Not yet.
I want to see what's going on.

01:06:33.914 --> 01:06:35.903
And why are you here with me?

01:06:35.982 --> 01:06:38.470
I want to protect you, Stanley.
I like you.

01:06:38.548 --> 01:06:41.981
I'd hate to see you swatted.
Shut up. Here she comes.

01:06:42.047 --> 01:06:44.537
Lovely weather we've been having.
Lovely.

01:06:44.617 --> 01:06:46.605
Of course, we've been
kept pretty busy.

01:06:46.682 --> 01:06:50.672
It's the summer frocks. I've had three
rapes on my hands this morning.

01:06:50.749 --> 01:06:53.738
- Is that a lot?
- Oh, round about the seasonal average.

01:06:53.816 --> 01:06:56.009
That's a nice dress you're wearing.

01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:57.946
I don't like his attitude.

01:06:58.016 --> 01:07:01.176
I've always had mixed
feelings about rape.

01:07:07.317 --> 01:07:10.080
I mean, half the time,
it's the, uh... the girls...

01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:12.379
that have led things on.

01:07:12.452 --> 01:07:14.440
I agree with you.

01:07:18.518 --> 01:07:21.881
They bring it on themselves,
you know. They really do.

01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:26.816
I'm so happy he's not here.

01:07:26.885 --> 01:07:30.909
But we must find him
before he kills himself.

01:07:30.987 --> 01:07:32.816
She noticed me! She noticed me!

01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:34.818
Well.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.810
Thank you, lads.

01:07:39.387 --> 01:07:41.376
Not him?

01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:45.510
Oh, it's cold in here.

01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:48.247
He seemed a cut above the others.

01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:50.481
There was something
different about him.

01:07:50.556 --> 01:07:52.747
A special quality.

01:07:52.821 --> 01:07:55.810
He put so much into
those cheeseburgers.

01:07:55.887 --> 01:07:57.750
He was a real artist.

01:07:57.822 --> 01:08:00.346
Yes, but like so many of
your artistic types...

01:08:00.423 --> 01:08:03.356
unable to cope with life, he
took the coward's way out.

01:08:03.424 --> 01:08:05.083
He called me a coward!

01:08:05.157 --> 01:08:08.452
The vice squad is having
a bit of a do tonight.

01:08:08.523 --> 01:08:11.421
Would you like to come along?
Will I be allowed?

01:08:11.491 --> 01:08:14.081
An outsider?
Of course!

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.782
They asked us to bring
along a girlfriend.

01:08:16.857 --> 01:08:18.788
You'd soon feel at home.

01:08:18.857 --> 01:08:22.345
I'm gonna break this up!
But you've never flown before.

01:08:22.424 --> 01:08:24.482
You can't go up alone.

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:27.286
Oh, yes, I can.
I'll take him first. You follow.

01:08:29.358 --> 01:08:32.349
The Vice Squad is usually having
a first-class get-together.

01:08:32.426 --> 01:08:34.687
Flap them, Stanley!

01:08:34.759 --> 01:08:37.089
Not your legs, your wings!

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.157
You've got lovely lips.
Very tempting and alluring.

01:08:42.225 --> 01:08:44.455
"Lorelie lips" is what I call 'em.

01:08:44.527 --> 01:08:47.581
Has anyone ever said that before?
No, never.

01:08:47.658 --> 01:08:51.116
Here I come, Stanley!
I don't want to alarm you...

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:54.524
but I'd say that lips like that
would be a magnet to sex maniacs.

01:08:54.594 --> 01:08:56.582
Really?
Oh!

01:08:56.662 --> 01:08:59.220
Oh! Oh!
Damn flies!

01:08:59.296 --> 01:09:03.557
Oh, it's a whopper!
Oh, let's get out of this fly trap.

01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:26.385
Blow your raspberry.

01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:29.259
I can't, with these
terrible fly's lips!

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:33.492
Quick, blow your raspberry!

01:09:37.698 --> 01:09:40.187
She noticed me, George.
She noticed me.

01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:43.323
I must have her before she goes to
that terrible vice party with the police.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.957
- That's what I'm here for.
- I want her to be in love
with everything about me.

01:09:47.033 --> 01:09:50.022
Madly in love with me!
Look, Stanley.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:54.033
I feel terribly bad about the way
I've tricked you in the past.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:58.125
I want to be nice to you this time. Really
nice to you. I mean it. I'd like to help you.

01:09:58.867 --> 01:10:01.026
I've been thinking
about your problem.

01:10:01.101 --> 01:10:04.124
What I think you need
is the simple life.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:06.258
How does this strike you?

01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:11.325
You and Margaret are both
warm, tender, loving people.

01:10:11.403 --> 01:10:14.392
Picture a little cottage
in the country.

01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:18.924
Two beautiful children are
playing in the sunlit garden.

01:10:19.003 --> 01:10:22.230
Margaret's in the kitchen,
preparing the anniversary dinner.

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:24.791
She hears you drive up in the car.

01:10:24.869 --> 01:10:27.358
She's madly in love with
you and you with her.

01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:31.164
She's bursting with the anticipation
of seeing you at the end of the day.

01:10:31.237 --> 01:10:34.226
By George, you've got it.
I think you've got it.

01:10:34.304 --> 01:10:38.794
Julie Andrews

01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:41.529
Darling! Mmm!

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:49.499
Hello, darling. Mmm.
Hello, darling.

01:10:49.571 --> 01:10:52.733
Hope you don't mind me bringing Stanley along.
Oh, he's always welcome.

01:10:52.806 --> 01:10:54.963
Would you like a drink, Stanley?
Please.

01:10:55.038 --> 01:10:58.028
I'll do that. You sit down.
You've been coping with the kids all day.

01:10:58.106 --> 01:11:01.129
Go on. Have a good sit-down. Relax.
What are you going to have? Your usual?

01:11:01.206 --> 01:11:03.196
Yes, dear.
Right.

01:11:03.274 --> 01:11:05.603
You know that, um...
that book I was reading?

01:11:05.674 --> 01:11:08.663
The Spinoza Reassessment?
Yes.

01:11:08.741 --> 01:11:11.502
I was thinking Stanley should have
a look at that. Fascinating.

01:11:11.574 --> 01:11:14.039
Absolutely fascinating.

01:11:14.107 --> 01:11:17.836
Here we are. Old Mr. Wine will
soon set you on your feet again.

01:11:17.908 --> 01:11:21.465
What for you, Stanley?
Oh, I'll have the same as Margaret.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.769
Same as Margaret. Wine.

01:11:23.842 --> 01:11:27.501
I bet you thought I'd
forgotten what day it was.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:31.304
How awful of me. I forgot.

01:11:31.377 --> 01:11:35.138
Don't be silly.
You've got so much on your mind.

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:37.698
Who cares about a silly
old anniversary?

01:11:37.777 --> 01:11:40.208
What matters is we love each other.

01:11:40.278 --> 01:11:43.802
Do you know, Stanley, we've been married
seven years? It's our wooden wedding.

01:11:43.878 --> 01:11:46.639
Incredible.
I got a little something for you.

01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:49.075
Oh!
From my heart.

01:11:49.145 --> 01:11:51.372
Darling. Oh.

01:11:53.477 --> 01:11:55.671
Here's to our marriage.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.974
Here's to all of us.

01:11:58.046 --> 01:11:59.978
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:12:00.046 --> 01:12:02.035
Cheers.

01:12:02.113 --> 01:12:05.136
I'll go and get that book.

01:12:07.247 --> 01:12:10.735
I forgot our wedding anniversary.
Don't be upset.

01:12:10.812 --> 01:12:14.210
I feel so dreadful!
Oh, darling...

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.270
Here we are.
See what you make of it.

01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:19.835
We can discuss it at next
week's tutorial. Fine.

01:12:19.913 --> 01:12:22.402
I must get on with the cooking.
Don't you do a thing.

01:12:22.481 --> 01:12:26.607
You sit down, relax and enjoy your drink.
I'll do the supper tonight.

01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:29.670
I feel a bit of an intruder,
your anniversary and everything.

01:12:29.747 --> 01:12:32.771
You're not an intruder.
You're very welcome. Isn't he, Margaret?

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.939
Well, I ought to be off anyway.

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:38.448
I want to catch the Giotto exhibition.
What time's the next bus to Oxford?

01:12:38.516 --> 01:12:41.311
Are you going to that?
I've got a great idea.

01:12:41.382 --> 01:12:45.042
Margaret, why don't you drive Stanley?
You can see it together.

01:12:45.117 --> 01:12:47.777
- You've been longing to see that.
It's the last day.
- I can't.

01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:50.578
- There's the supper, the kids to put to bed.
- I'll do all that.

01:12:50.651 --> 01:12:53.640
It'll be your present to me. Really.

01:12:53.717 --> 01:12:55.649
You are sweet, darling.

01:12:55.717 --> 01:12:58.878
- Go on. Enjoy yourself
and come back for supper.
- Are you sure?

01:12:58.952 --> 01:13:02.383
Absolutely positive.
Hello, darlings!

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.440
Up into Daddy's arms.

01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:06.609
Bye-bye.
Say bye-bye to Mommy. Bye-bye.

01:13:06.685 --> 01:13:09.673
Look after Daddy, darlings.
Look after Margaret, Stanley.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:13.879
I will. Have a good time.
Blow a kiss to Mommy.

01:13:13.953 --> 01:13:16.475
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:28.509
Do you think he knows?
It would never occur to him.

01:13:31.588 --> 01:13:33.519
Oh.

01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:39.155
He's such a marvelous man.

01:13:39.223 --> 01:13:43.381
The way he brings
philosophy to life.

01:13:43.454 --> 01:13:47.218
Oh, he couldn't be a
better husband or father.

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:50.882
Or teacher. He's a saint.

01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:55.450
He's the only man I know...

01:13:55.522 --> 01:13:58.318
who actually lives
up to his ideals.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:00.981
He's such an example to us all.

01:14:04.957 --> 01:14:07.549
The children worship him.

01:14:07.624 --> 01:14:10.647
He's more of a god
than a human being.

01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:13.316
If only he weren't so good.

01:14:13.392 --> 01:14:15.790
If only he had one tiny flaw.

01:14:15.859 --> 01:14:18.189
We must stop thinking about him...

01:14:18.257 --> 01:14:21.486
and think more of ourselves!

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.884
But it would kill him if he knew.

01:14:25.959 --> 01:14:29.982
I feel as if I'm being torn apart.

01:14:34.427 --> 01:14:37.688
My darling.
My precious darling.

01:14:39.261 --> 01:14:41.886
We c... We can't...

01:14:41.961 --> 01:14:44.120
We can't keep on denying ourselves.

01:14:44.194 --> 01:14:46.786
All these years we've
been married...

01:14:46.862 --> 01:14:49.021
he's never said a cross word.

01:14:49.095 --> 01:14:51.083
When I was ill...

01:14:51.163 --> 01:14:55.094
he came to my room...

01:14:55.161 --> 01:14:57.822
and he gave me some soup...

01:14:57.897 --> 01:14:59.829
he made!

01:14:59.897 --> 01:15:04.591
Oh, Stanley!
How can we do this to him?

01:15:05.697 --> 01:15:07.823
I love you.

01:15:07.897 --> 01:15:10.362
And I love you.

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:15.419
It... It can't hurt him
if he doesn't know.

01:15:15.497 --> 01:15:18.396
I... I want... I want...

01:15:18.464 --> 01:15:20.828
I want to give you my love...

01:15:20.898 --> 01:15:25.559
in the best, most...
most beautiful way.

01:15:32.599 --> 01:15:35.588
Oh. Oh.

01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:37.962
Ow!

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:41.693
What? What is it?

01:15:41.766 --> 01:15:45.255
It's his pipe. His favorite pipe.

01:15:45.334 --> 01:15:47.891
But, Margaret,
don't be upset, please.

01:15:47.967 --> 01:15:50.159
And we were going to...

01:15:50.234 --> 01:15:52.393
On his favorite pipe!

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:56.234
The whole thing's impossible!

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:58.166
No, Margaret!
Go. Just go!

01:15:58.236 --> 01:16:00.725
We must never see each
other again, for his sake.

01:16:00.802 --> 01:16:04.098
Margaret, please.
Please, Margaret! Oh!

01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:09.067
Margaret, please!
Margaret, I beg of you!

01:16:09.134 --> 01:16:12.364
Wh...

01:16:21.937 --> 01:16:24.300
Ohh.
Hello, Stanley.

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:26.302
Hold this.

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.302
Whatever you say, George.

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:30.302
You sound down in the dumps.

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.303
Why not?

01:16:32.371 --> 01:16:35.701
You painted a beautiful dream
and shoved me into a nightmare.

01:16:35.772 --> 01:16:39.001
You should never believe the ads.
Shine the light up a bit.

01:16:39.073 --> 01:16:41.230
What are you doing now?

01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:45.329
Just putting a tiny little
ventilation hole in this oil tanker.

01:16:46.739 --> 01:16:49.170
Up we go.

01:16:50.407 --> 01:16:52.930
That Nicholas was so sickening...

01:16:53.007 --> 01:16:57.234
with all his blasted
sweetness and... ugh!

01:16:57.307 --> 01:16:59.297
I know what you mean, Stanley.

01:16:59.374 --> 01:17:02.203
Most of the saints throughout history
have been a pain in the neck.

01:17:02.273 --> 01:17:05.502
Give me a hand with these bottles, would you?
I'm due down in Fleet Street.

01:17:05.574 --> 01:17:07.563
You can't stop, can you, eh?

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.335
As a matter of fact, I will very soon.
My job's almost done.

01:17:10.409 --> 01:17:12.342
What do you mean?

01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:15.968
I was up in heaven a few thousand years
ago, having a summit conference with God.

01:17:16.044 --> 01:17:18.372
I was putting forward
a few new proposals.

01:17:18.442 --> 01:17:20.874
You go up there every now and again?
Yes.

01:17:20.943 --> 01:17:23.203
We were having a giggle
about Job actually.

01:17:23.275 --> 01:17:27.675
That poor bloke you gave all the boils to and
burnt his home and destroyed his family?

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:31.572
That's right. God thought it would be a
good idea if I tested Job's faith...

01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:33.906
with a few diseases and disasters.

01:17:33.978 --> 01:17:35.968
You didn't win, though, did you, eh?

01:17:36.045 --> 01:17:39.534
In spite of all you did to him, he
still believed that God was good.

01:17:39.611 --> 01:17:42.372
Well, Job was what you'd
technically describe as a loony.

01:17:42.444 --> 01:17:45.239
But as I pointed out
to God at the time...

01:17:45.313 --> 01:17:49.040
for every job or soul that
he lands, I get two.

01:17:49.112 --> 01:17:51.476
I was two billion ahead already.

01:17:51.545 --> 01:17:53.876
You make it sound
like a blooming game.

01:17:53.946 --> 01:17:55.878
That's precisely what it is...

01:17:55.946 --> 01:17:59.274
and the first one to reach a hundred
billion souls is the winner.

01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:03.404
He doesn't stand a chance actually.
I've only got six to go.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.639
What happens when you get them?

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.306
Oh, when I've won... when I've won...

01:18:08.381 --> 01:18:10.973
the world will be in such a
rotten, stinking mess...

01:18:11.047 --> 01:18:13.038
that it can get on without me.

01:18:13.115 --> 01:18:17.512
I'll go back to heaven, sit on God's right
hand and be his favorite angel again.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.570
It must be very nice for you to go back
to heaven, but... what will happen to me?

01:18:22.648 --> 01:18:25.581
Don't worry, Stanley.
Your future's assured.

01:18:25.649 --> 01:18:27.582
Um, George...

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:32.378
I don't want to go on with
the rest of my wishes.

01:18:32.451 --> 01:18:36.176
I can't find happiness like this.
You're always too clever for me.

01:18:36.249 --> 01:18:38.945
So, um, I'll be running along...

01:18:39.017 --> 01:18:41.745
and, uh, I'll see you sometime, eh?

01:18:48.217 --> 01:18:51.047
Stanley, I can't let
you go in this mood.

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:54.175
Let's cancel my appointment.
I'm ahead of schedule, in any case.

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:57.343
No, I can't interrupt your work.
What are friends for?

01:18:57.418 --> 01:19:01.186
I'll round up Avarice and Gluttony, two
lovely girls. The afternoon's on me.

01:19:01.318 --> 01:19:04.716
Whee!

01:19:04.786 --> 01:19:07.275
Oh, eat up, Stanley!

01:19:07.354 --> 01:19:10.045
Come on, Stanley. Stick one in
Jane Russell and win a goldfish.

01:19:10.118 --> 01:19:12.415
No.

01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:16.248
You have a go, Gluttony.
Chuck 'em. Don't eat 'em.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:19.411
This is how Garibaldi lost his life.

01:19:19.487 --> 01:19:23.886
Enjoying yourself, Stanley?
You know I can't stand heights, George.

01:19:25.053 --> 01:19:28.646
Up, up, up, up!
Having fun, Stanley?

01:19:31.788 --> 01:19:33.414
Bang!

01:19:35.954 --> 01:19:39.149
Another 10 shillings gone.
Don't worry about that, Avarice.

01:19:39.222 --> 01:19:42.416
Whee!

01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:48.256
Enjoying yourself, Stanley?

01:19:48.322 --> 01:19:51.948
That's three pounds-seven and nine
pence without Gluttony's sweets.

01:19:54.358 --> 01:19:56.220
George, take me out
of here, will you?

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:58.949
Enough, George, is enough.

01:19:59.023 --> 01:20:01.014
We didn't need to take a taxi.

01:20:01.091 --> 01:20:04.058
Nothing's too much for
my friend Stanley.

01:20:04.124 --> 01:20:07.284
Thank you very much for this
afternoon, George, but, um...

01:20:07.358 --> 01:20:09.847
I don't think it's
really helped, you know.

01:20:09.924 --> 01:20:13.290
I still don't want to go on with it.
But you were so nearly there.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.348
She loved you, you loved her.
You just left me one little loophole.

01:20:17.426 --> 01:20:20.984
I had to take advantage of it.
Doctor's orders.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:25.320
Next time you must specify,
really spell things out in detail.

01:20:25.392 --> 01:20:28.052
I can't think straight anymore.

01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:31.752
Take your time.
Have another lie-down in my room.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:35.783
Yeah, and then you put Lust
in the bed just to confuse me.

01:20:35.861 --> 01:20:39.420
I promise you, Lust
won't be there.

01:20:43.061 --> 01:20:44.993
Hello.

01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:47.620
Oh, excuse me. I thought this
was Mr. Spiggott's bedroom.

01:20:47.696 --> 01:20:50.457
How right you were. It is.

01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:54.485
Oh. Well, he must have made a mistake.
He said I could use it.

01:20:54.563 --> 01:20:57.461
Oh, you're his new little
favorite, are you?

01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:59.498
I'm Stanley Moon. Who are you?

01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:02.461
They call me Envy.

01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:05.326
Not a very attractive name, is it?

01:21:05.398 --> 01:21:09.853
I always wanted to be called Vanity.
Never mind. I'm stuck with it.

01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:12.954
How is Mr. Spiggott these days?

01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:15.726
Quite well.
He may be leaving soon.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.789
Charming.

01:21:17.865 --> 01:21:20.457
I'm always the last to be told.

01:21:20.532 --> 01:21:23.328
It's funny how he's always
too busy for me...

01:21:23.399 --> 01:21:26.990
but he's never too
busy for Lust, ducky.

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:29.588
He's at her beck and bloody call.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:32.724
Look, what are you doing
in George's bedroom?

01:21:32.801 --> 01:21:35.632
Oh, it's "George," is it?

01:21:35.701 --> 01:21:38.097
Good friends, I suppose.

01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:42.328
If you want to know why I'm in his
bedroom, go and take a look at mine.

01:21:42.401 --> 01:21:44.629
What's wrong with it?
What's right with it?

01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:47.361
For a start, it's half the
size of all the others.

01:21:47.434 --> 01:21:50.697
Wallpaper's peeling off, and it's
miles from the nearest convenience.

01:21:50.769 --> 01:21:54.428
Of course, Lust and Gluttony are
right next door to the bathroom.

01:21:54.502 --> 01:21:56.764
Nothing's too good for them.

01:21:56.836 --> 01:21:59.325
Well, I suppose Lust and Gluttony...

01:21:59.402 --> 01:22:02.426
really have to be rather
near the bathroom.

01:22:02.503 --> 01:22:06.060
You're on the seven-wishes
bit, aren't you, dear?

01:22:06.136 --> 01:22:09.796
Yeah, but it doesn't seem
to be doing me much good.

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:13.632
Although George said if I really specified
the personality, I'd be all right.

01:22:13.703 --> 01:22:16.533
Don't you believe it, cherub.

01:22:16.603 --> 01:22:19.091
He may think he's the
cat's whiskers...

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:23.401
but there's one person who
can run rings round him.

01:22:23.681 --> 01:22:25.529
Who do you mean?

01:22:27.614 --> 01:22:28.973
God?

01:22:29.152 --> 01:22:34.465
Old creepy drawers can't
hold a candle to him.

01:22:34.539 --> 01:22:38.631
I think you've got me this time, Stanley.
Let me get it quite clear.

01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:42.638
I want to be a warm,
loving, tender person...

01:22:42.706 --> 01:22:45.332
and Margaret exactly the same.

01:22:45.406 --> 01:22:49.398
I want all the fun of meeting her for the
first time and falling in love with her.

01:22:49.476 --> 01:22:53.304
I love her, and she loves me.
We're in love forever.

01:22:53.375 --> 01:22:56.034
Surroundings?

01:22:56.108 --> 01:22:59.040
Serene and far removed...

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:02.097
from the false glitter...

01:23:02.176 --> 01:23:06.472
the raucous music and the neon
lights of this modern world.

01:23:06.543 --> 01:23:11.839
We're both young, white
and in perfect health.

01:23:11.909 --> 01:23:15.239
Stanley, I've gotta hand it to you.

01:23:15.309 --> 01:23:18.037
That's real specifying.

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:22.168
You've come up with the one formula
that I, as the devil, really dread...

01:23:22.244 --> 01:23:25.142
mutual love and spiritual values.

01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:28.507
I want peace and quiet...

01:23:28.578 --> 01:23:31.974
and... and no other men in her life.

01:23:32.044 --> 01:23:35.443
Julie Andrews.

01:23:40.479 --> 01:23:42.742
Shh!

01:23:44.679 --> 01:23:47.441
Welcome to the Berelian
Order, Sister Luna.

01:23:47.513 --> 01:23:50.945
Until you are initiated, you
will wear the habit of a novice.

01:23:51.013 --> 01:23:53.844
We must speak no more.

01:25:48.557 --> 01:25:51.184
<i>The order of the Leaping
Berelians is new...</i>

01:25:51.258 --> 01:25:53.521
<i>and nondenominational.</i>

01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:56.717
<i>Our patron, Beryl of Sussex,
was a simple shepherdess.</i>

01:25:56.791 --> 01:26:00.247
<i>One afternoon she saw a vision
in the sky which beckoned her.</i>

01:26:00.325 --> 01:26:03.349
<i>Dropping her crook, she
leapt towards the vision...</i>

01:26:03.426 --> 01:26:06.914
<i>which, ever receding and ever
beckoning, urged her upwards...</i>

01:26:06.992 --> 01:26:09.357
<i>until she disappeared
into the clouds.</i>

01:26:09.427 --> 01:26:11.914
<i>This miracle was witnessed
by a two-year-old child...</i>

01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:16.449
<i>who ran to the spot and picked up Beryl's
shoes that had fallen to the Earth.</i>

01:26:16.526 --> 01:26:19.323
<i>That child founded this order...</i>

01:26:19.395 --> 01:26:21.953
<i>whose Sisters have taken
a vow of silence...</i>

01:26:22.029 --> 01:26:25.358
<i>until such time as Beryl
of Sussex is canonized...</i>

01:26:25.428 --> 01:26:30.258
<i>and recognized by the people of the
world for her tremendous feat.</i>

01:26:47.363 --> 01:26:51.296
What is this feeling
that overwhelms me?

01:26:51.363 --> 01:26:53.521
It is something new and strange.

01:26:53.596 --> 01:26:57.620
It is love, oh, my most cherished.
I see it in your eyes.

01:26:57.697 --> 01:27:02.494
This is love profane. Must be sin
in me that so confounds my senses.

01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:05.293
There is no sin in love, my darling.

01:27:05.365 --> 01:27:07.795
And I love you for all eternity.

01:27:07.865 --> 01:27:11.263
Margaret.
You know my name.

01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.264
What magic is afoot?

01:27:13.332 --> 01:27:17.458
Our love is written in the book
of fate. There is no escaping it.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.521
This can't be right...

01:27:19.599 --> 01:27:24.000
and yet, within my breast
beats such desire.

01:27:24.067 --> 01:27:26.999
Don't be afraid. Just trust in me.

01:27:27.066 --> 01:27:29.364
Allow your heart to speak.

01:28:16.706 --> 01:28:19.762
You must go through with the initiation
ceremony to show your faith.

01:28:19.839 --> 01:28:24.329
But I'm afraid of heights.
Show your courage in your leaping.

01:29:47.413 --> 01:29:51.677
I didn't go to vespers.
I had to see if you were all right.

01:29:51.748 --> 01:29:54.713
Oh, Margaret, my precious.
At last we're alone. We can speak.

01:29:54.781 --> 01:29:57.612
But only this once.

01:29:57.682 --> 01:30:01.011
Whatever it is that draws us
together we must cast out.

01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:03.344
It is unnatural and wrong.

01:30:03.416 --> 01:30:06.540
How can it be wrong if
we love each other?

01:30:06.615 --> 01:30:08.582
It is wrong...

01:30:08.648 --> 01:30:11.614
and I'm so ashamed to break my vow.

01:30:11.682 --> 01:30:14.911
I came here to find
peace and quiet...

01:30:14.983 --> 01:30:16.973
and faith.

01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:20.278
And have you found it?
Not yet.

01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:22.579
However hard I try...

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:25.276
I can't believe that God exists.

01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:28.010
But he does exist.
I know that for certain.

01:30:28.084 --> 01:30:31.676
How can you be so sure?
Because I've met the devil.

01:30:31.751 --> 01:30:34.217
The devil?
Yeah.

01:30:34.283 --> 01:30:38.183
Let me tell you what happened to me.
I used to be a man.

01:30:38.252 --> 01:30:41.980
My name was Stanley Moon,
and I was a short order cook.

01:30:42.053 --> 01:30:45.451
I was very much in love with you,
but I was too shy to tell you.

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.213
I've never seen you before today.

01:30:48.285 --> 01:30:51.547
I got so miserable that
I tried to kill myself.

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.347
And then George came along and
offered me seven wishes for my soul.

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:58.182
Who's George?
Well, he's the devil.

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:02.687
We're very good friends. He's not so bad
when you understand his problems.

01:31:02.755 --> 01:31:04.720
That's why I keep going...

01:31:04.788 --> 01:31:06.719
'Cause I usually
disappear when I go...

01:31:06.787 --> 01:31:10.812
I find that as hard to believe as
all that about Beryl and her leap.

01:31:10.889 --> 01:31:14.117
But it's true, and I've
got one wish to go.

01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:17.156
I can't think what's
happened to George. Look.

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:19.382
You see? Nothing.

01:31:19.456 --> 01:31:22.250
I just hope it's not too late.

01:31:23.757 --> 01:31:27.209
I love you, Margaret.
And I love you, Sister Luna.

01:31:27.289 --> 01:31:30.414
And my love will last forever.

01:31:30.489 --> 01:31:33.888
But it can never be... fulfilled.

01:31:36.459 --> 01:31:39.549
I must find George before
he goes to heaven.

01:31:40.626 --> 01:31:42.682
Good evening, Sister.

01:31:53.626 --> 01:31:57.025
We gave already!
Let me in! Let me in!

01:31:59.895 --> 01:32:02.655
Take that, you great git!

01:32:02.727 --> 01:32:06.125
Huh. Sorry, Father.

01:32:08.193 --> 01:32:12.353
Can I be of any help? Oh!

01:32:12.427 --> 01:32:14.519
Wake up, George!

01:32:14.594 --> 01:32:17.061
George, wake up.

01:32:17.129 --> 01:32:19.457
Thank goodness you're still here.

01:32:19.528 --> 01:32:24.153
I was just having a bit of
a nap before the party.

01:32:24.228 --> 01:32:27.128
I've done it.
I've got me hundred billion.

01:32:27.195 --> 01:32:30.253
Oh, congratulations.
Look, what went wrong?

01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:33.660
I blew my raspberry hundreds of
times, and nothing happened.

01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:36.720
I still got one more wish to go, you know.
How'd you figure that out?

01:32:36.798 --> 01:32:40.593
I was the intellectual, I was Sir
Stanley Moon, the businessman...

01:32:40.663 --> 01:32:44.687
I was the fly, the pop singer, the
student, and this one makes six.

01:32:44.763 --> 01:32:48.560
What about the Frobisher and Gleason
raspberry-flavored ice lolly?

01:32:48.631 --> 01:32:52.564
- That didn't count!
- Of course it did.
It was a wish, wasn't it?

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:54.689
That reminds me.

01:32:54.765 --> 01:32:56.754
I owe you sixpence.

01:32:58.665 --> 01:33:00.858
Here we are. Now we're even.

01:33:00.932 --> 01:33:03.899
Then I'm stuck as a woman?
As a nun.

01:33:03.967 --> 01:33:07.228
You should have specified the sex.

01:33:11.801 --> 01:33:15.892
You've won, haven't you, George? Well, if
I can't have Margaret, I'll kill myself.

01:33:15.967 --> 01:33:19.297
Sorry, Stanley. It's
out of the question.

01:33:19.367 --> 01:33:22.163
Whatever you are on your last
wish you remain forever.

01:33:52.904 --> 01:33:56.530
Isn't this a terrific party?

01:33:56.605 --> 01:34:00.560
Terrific for some, ducky.
Look at the lousy table I've got.

01:34:22.773 --> 01:34:25.262
Come on, sweetie. Let's dance.

01:34:25.341 --> 01:34:27.636
No, thank you.

01:34:36.776 --> 01:34:39.400
You're going now, George?
Yes, Stanley.

01:34:39.476 --> 01:34:41.998
I thought I'd just
sneak away quietly.

01:34:42.075 --> 01:34:44.009
I don't want to spoil the party.

01:34:44.076 --> 01:34:47.304
Well, um, I hope you get back in...

01:34:47.375 --> 01:34:49.364
you know, upstairs.

01:34:49.442 --> 01:34:51.500
Thank you very much.

01:34:51.576 --> 01:34:54.906
Apart from Margaret, you're the only
person I've ever enjoyed talking to.

01:34:54.977 --> 01:34:59.307
Now you're going, and,
well, I can't talk to her.

01:34:59.377 --> 01:35:01.343
Um, I'll rather miss you.

01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:03.741
I'll miss you too, Stanley.

01:35:03.812 --> 01:35:08.141
You know, looking around
the party at everybody...

01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:12.007
all of them trying to be something
they weren't in the first place...

01:35:12.078 --> 01:35:16.170
all I want to be is me, what
I was before I met you.

01:35:16.245 --> 01:35:20.338
But that's impossible.
You can't be that without your soul.

01:35:20.412 --> 01:35:25.140
Being me didn't seem like
very much at the time.

01:35:25.212 --> 01:35:29.475
Well, it wasn't very much, but it's a
good deal better than the alternatives.

01:35:31.548 --> 01:35:35.776
I'd give... anything
to be myself again.

01:35:37.182 --> 01:35:41.095
But I don't have anything
to give, really, do I?

01:35:42.829 --> 01:35:44.819
Look, I'll tell you what, Stanley.

01:35:44.897 --> 01:35:47.693
I've got me hundred billion
souls and a few to spare.

01:35:47.763 --> 01:35:51.526
I don't really need yours. It's not much of
a catch. I can give it to you back again.

01:35:51.597 --> 01:35:53.858
Is it possible?

01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:57.762
It's never been done before.
It's a very magnanimous gesture.

01:35:57.832 --> 01:36:01.319
In fact, it's a glorious gesture.

01:36:01.397 --> 01:36:03.830
Part of my new image. Here we are.

01:36:03.899 --> 01:36:06.194
I knew you weren't all bad.

01:36:06.265 --> 01:36:09.197
Of course not. I've just been
thoroughly misunderstood.

01:36:09.265 --> 01:36:12.289
Now, then take this, burn it
up, and when it's all gone...

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:14.355
you'll be Stanley Moon again...

01:36:14.433 --> 01:36:18.421
short order chef,
Caucasian, 28, male.

01:36:18.499 --> 01:36:21.431
And what about Margaret?
She'll be at Wimpy's as usual.

01:36:21.499 --> 01:36:24.524
Nobody will know that any
of this has ever happened.

01:36:24.601 --> 01:36:27.760
You're an angel, George.
Here's hoping.

01:36:27.834 --> 01:36:31.494
Do me a favor, Stanley. Look after the party
for me. See everybody has a good time.

01:36:31.568 --> 01:36:33.761
When that's done, it's over to you.

01:36:33.835 --> 01:36:35.823
I'll do my best.

01:36:40.435 --> 01:36:43.265
Bye, George.
Bye, Stanley.

01:37:07.438 --> 01:37:11.064
Hello, my good man. Are you Saint Peter?
Yes.

01:37:11.138 --> 01:37:13.569
I'd like to see God, please.
Who shall I say is calling?

01:37:13.637 --> 01:37:15.571
Oh, come on. You know me.

01:37:15.638 --> 01:37:18.002
Beelzebub, Lucifer,
Prince of Darkness.

01:37:18.073 --> 01:37:20.596
Have you an appointment?
He's always got time for me.

01:37:20.673 --> 01:37:23.605
I'll just see if he's...
Don't say you'll just see if he's in.

01:37:23.673 --> 01:37:27.106
Of course he's in.
Blimey, how did you get this job?

01:37:27.173 --> 01:37:30.162
Would you wait here, sir?
Hurry up then!

01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:34.535
If I were you wanting to get in,
I should try being a bit more humble.

01:37:34.606 --> 01:37:36.867
Oh, would you really? Yes.

01:37:36.939 --> 01:37:39.338
I dare say you would.
You're quite right, of course.

01:37:39.407 --> 01:37:42.067
I'll throw a bit of filth over meself.
That should please him.

01:37:47.509 --> 01:37:49.474
He'll see you now.

01:37:49.541 --> 01:37:52.269
Oh, thank you very much.

01:37:58.842 --> 01:38:01.070
Hello!

01:38:01.142 --> 01:38:03.472
God!

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:06.101
It's me.

01:38:06.177 --> 01:38:09.575
Where are you?

01:38:09.644 --> 01:38:13.542
I wish you'd manifest yourself a bit.
It's so hard just talking to thin air.

01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:18.408
On thy belly shalt thou go!

01:38:18.479 --> 01:38:21.206
Oh, blimey. You're not still
on about that, are you?

01:38:21.279 --> 01:38:25.007
All right.
Dust shalt thou eat!

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.375
Oh, naturally, yes.
Dust, of course. What else?

01:38:27.446 --> 01:38:31.572
Mmm. Delicious. This is very
good. Num, num, num.

01:38:31.646 --> 01:38:33.613
Speak!

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.305
It's a bit difficult with all
this dust in me mouth...

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:38.313
but I've come about readmission.

01:38:38.381 --> 01:38:40.846
You know, I'm ready to come
back in again and join you.

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:45.369
Hast thou, in thy purpose,
swayed or wavered?

01:38:45.448 --> 01:38:47.744
Swayed or wavered?

01:38:47.814 --> 01:38:51.940
Just take a look at the world.
It's never been in such a mess.

01:38:52.014 --> 01:38:53.946
I've done a wonderful job.

01:38:54.014 --> 01:38:57.276
People are killing each other,
lusting after each other's wives...

01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:59.281
worshipping false idols.

01:38:59.349 --> 01:39:03.747
I've done a marvelous job. It's never been
so sinful, miserable and perverted.

01:39:03.815 --> 01:39:07.441
You should be very happy.

01:39:07.515 --> 01:39:11.176
Oh, don't go forming
yourself into a whirlwind...

01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:14.080
just 'cause I got to a
hundred billion souls first.

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:17.808
Somebody's got to lose. Oh, I'll tell you
something that'll really please you.

01:39:17.884 --> 01:39:21.440
I've done a good deed. I gave
that little twit his soul back.

01:39:21.517 --> 01:39:25.847
Wasn't that generous?
Made me feel marvelous!

01:39:25.918 --> 01:39:28.714
Well, come on. Am I in?

01:39:29.951 --> 01:39:32.918
Hello. Where are you?

01:39:32.985 --> 01:39:36.349
This way, please.
What's happening?

01:39:36.419 --> 01:39:39.284
One moment he was talking to me,
the next moment he was gone.

01:39:39.352 --> 01:39:42.079
I'm afraid you failed the
entrance examination.

01:39:42.152 --> 01:39:45.517
I can't have failed. I've done
everything he asked of me.

01:39:45.586 --> 01:39:48.348
And to show how repentant I was,
I even did a good deed.

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.853
Made me feel marvelous, just
like I was in the old days.

01:39:51.921 --> 01:39:55.581
There you are. It sounds as if you made
a good gesture for the wrong motives.

01:39:55.655 --> 01:39:57.245
What do you mean, "wrong motives"?

01:39:57.321 --> 01:40:00.617
For your own joy, to make you
feel better than someone else.

01:40:00.688 --> 01:40:03.915
Oh. Well, I can fix that.

01:40:03.987 --> 01:40:07.648
I'll get Stanley to give me his soul back,
then return it for the right reasons.

01:40:07.722 --> 01:40:10.846
I won't be proud. Tell God not to go away.
I'll be back in a minute.

01:40:17.456 --> 01:40:19.617
Stanley! Hold everything!

01:40:19.689 --> 01:40:22.849
Stanley! Stanley!

01:40:22.923 --> 01:40:27.323
Where are you?
It's me, George, your old friend.

01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:30.413
I want your soul back
just for a second.

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:33.491
Then I'll give it to you back in a better
way. I promise you. Where are you?

01:40:33.492 --> 01:40:35.718
Stanley!

01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:38.882
Are you in there? It's not a trick.

01:40:38.958 --> 01:40:40.548
Stanley!

01:40:40.624 --> 01:40:43.283
Stanley, wait!

01:40:43.357 --> 01:40:45.790
Stanley!

01:40:59.627 --> 01:41:01.785
I'm gonna do it.

01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:04.349
This time I'm...
I'm going to do it.

01:41:04.427 --> 01:41:07.621
I've got to do it.
I-I know I can and I know I will.

01:41:07.693 --> 01:41:11.888
Here... Here I go. Now!

01:41:11.961 --> 01:41:14.427
Miss Spencer!
What is it, Stanley?

01:41:17.261 --> 01:41:20.057
I wonder if you'd like to come
and have dinner with me tonight.

01:41:20.129 --> 01:41:23.390
Sorry. I'm already doing something.
Another night perhaps.

01:41:28.297 --> 01:41:33.229
Stanley. Stanley.
She could make it tonight. I could fix it.

01:41:33.297 --> 01:41:37.695
Tonight and every night.
I've got a new deal for you.

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:47.395
No, thanks, George.
I'd like to try it my way.

01:41:51.531 --> 01:41:53.655
What a triumph.

01:41:53.731 --> 01:41:55.924
Very funny.

01:41:55.997 --> 01:42:00.794
All right, you great git.
You've asked for it.

01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:04.856
I'll cover the world in
Tastee-Freez and Wimpy Burgers.

01:42:04.934 --> 01:42:08.763
I'll fill it full of concrete
runways, motorways...

01:42:08.833 --> 01:42:11.924
