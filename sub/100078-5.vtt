WEBVTT

00:04.839 --> 00:06.173
- Maggie?
- I need to take a minute.

00:09.135 --> 00:11.303
SHARON: Don't you feel
worn down from your chemo?

00:11.387 --> 00:13.514
If you don't want us
to treat you medically,

00:13.597 --> 00:14.807
then you're getting help.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.393
That Crockett guy,
what's the deal with him?

00:17.476 --> 00:18.811
ETHAN: Not sure he's my speed.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.063
Strikes me as someone
who doesn't take things seriously.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.607
We told your supervisor
we didn't want you treating our daughter.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.277
- I just need to check one last thing.
- Dr. Manning?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.070
I'm gonna want to
oversee all your cases,

00:28.154 --> 00:31.031
until we know your TBI
isn't adversely affecting your patients.

00:31.115 --> 00:32.241
You don't have
the authority.

00:32.324 --> 00:33.909
It's for your
own protection.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.332
I'll go talk to her.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.088
I know, I know, I'm late.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.840
It was hard getting out
of the house this morning.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.049
You sleep okay?

00:49.133 --> 00:51.927
I got a full eight hours.
I had breakfast.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.472
I don't have a headache.
I feel great.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.601
Toddler in Treatment Six.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.561
Nanny brought him in.
Parents just got here.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.688
A bloody nose?

01:02.772 --> 01:04.774
I'll do the intake
and then pass it off to Terry.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.484
This has med student
written all over it.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.819
I don't know.

01:09.528 --> 01:10.571
Lanik wants you
to take it.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.574
But I've got pediatric charts
to follow up on from the night shift.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.576
- I'll take care of them.
- Are you kidding?

01:15.659 --> 01:18.621
I was late because traffic sucked,
not because of my TBI.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.122
That's not my decision.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.959
I am fine.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.586
Natalie.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.046
(SIGHS)

01:36.972 --> 01:38.057
Thank you.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.021
(LAUGHING)

01:44.104 --> 01:45.314
What?

01:45.397 --> 01:47.566
The wink wasn't
exactly natural.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.902
I was trying to
match your sexy.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.445
Just keep being you.

01:57.743 --> 01:58.911
You catch any of that?

01:58.994 --> 02:01.455
You mean you
ogling my sister

02:01.539 --> 02:02.873
like she put
the gris–gris on you?

02:02.957 --> 02:04.250
- Yeah.
- Yes,

02:04.333 --> 02:07.336
- it's now burned into my retinas.
- Sorry.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.462
"Gris–gris"?

02:08.546 --> 02:10.422
It's a voodoo thing,

02:10.506 --> 02:12.299
means you're
under the spell.

02:12.383 --> 02:15.594
At least I think it does.
Dr. Marcel drops a lot of Cajun nuggets.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.596
You're starting
your surgical residency with him,

02:17.680 --> 02:18.931
not prepping
for Mardi Gras.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.641
Speaking of,
how's it going?

02:20.724 --> 02:22.434
It's intense.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.520
I mean, one minute
I'm cracking open a chest,

02:24.603 --> 02:26.063
the next I'm digging
through a belly.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.898
Just remember there's
an actual person on that table,

02:27.982 --> 02:29.024
not just a body.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.776
Of course.

02:30.860 --> 02:31.944
MARCEL: Dr. Choi.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.530
Good morning to you.
Dr. Sexton, right on time.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.031
- Let's go.
- Cool.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.742
Hey, hey there,
Ms. April.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.119
Good morning, Dr. Marcel.

02:42.121 --> 02:43.497
Did Noah say
anything to you

02:43.581 --> 02:45.124
about working
with Dr. Marcel?

02:45.207 --> 02:46.834
Just that he's keeping him
really busy,

02:46.917 --> 02:48.294
which I figure
is a good thing.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.839
Yeah.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.090
DANIEL: You know,
I got a question for you.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.092
CAROLINE: What?
DANIEL: Why are you so damn sexy?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.468
Stop it! Stop...

02:56.552 --> 02:58.679
How you gonna be talking nasty
in the middle of the hospital!

02:58.762 --> 03:01.348
I'm not nasty.
She's nasty, trust me.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.725
Well, you two
look happy.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.935
I'm here with my man.
What's not to be happy about?

03:05.019 --> 03:06.645
Where are you off to?

03:06.729 --> 03:07.980
You know,
I've been doing that volunteer upstairs.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.857
So we gonna go
grab a cup of coffee

03:09.940 --> 03:12.318
and then he's gonna
walk me upstairs afterwards.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.153
Wait a minute.
You should join us.

03:14.236 --> 03:17.573
Honey, I'm so sorry, it's the ED.
I gotta skip coffee.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.617
Okay.
What, well you do, but we don't.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.328
Uh, sorry, I have a staff meeting
in 20 minutes.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.204
Well, then, we gotta
drink fast then, right?

03:24.288 --> 03:25.789
Come on,
give me some.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.917
- I love you. I'll see you later.
- I love you, too.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.251
I love you, too,
but in a different way.

03:29.335 --> 03:30.544
Whatever.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.623
So, Carl, how long has the pain
and nausea been bothering you?

04:49.707 --> 04:51.917
Kind of lost track.
Let's just say, years.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.585
So it comes and goes?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.462
No, it came
and never left.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.547
I've learned
how to cope.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.008
But some days,
I just can't look the other way.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.969
(GROANS)
Yeah... Yeah, today's one of them.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.263
Actually, this is the
worst it's ever been.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.848
Vitals are normal.
Afebrile.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.183
Is this the first time
you've seen a doctor for it?

05:08.267 --> 05:11.395
Here in Chicago.
I'm from Tennessee, though.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.148
I was a regular
at the Westwood Regional ED.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.942
Pretty sure every doc there poked,
prodded and scanned me.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.360
I'll have them
forward his records.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.696
Did Westwood Regional
make a diagnosis?

05:20.779 --> 05:24.408
No, they had a lot of theories.
IBS, IBS–C, ulcer.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.618
One doc thought I had
an eating disorder.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.913
Believe me, I would pile on
the pounds if I could,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.041
but eating sends me
right to the bathroom.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.251
- Vomiting?
- Most of the time.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.712
I just can't believe
this is what I've been reduced to.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.297
I'm 26.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.966
I should've graduated college,
met someone special.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.468
Instead, my life
is making sure

05:42.551 --> 05:44.595
I always know where
the nearest bathroom is.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.180
We'll figure this out.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.890
Mo, let's get a chest X–ray,

05:47.973 --> 05:50.059
- KUB, CBC, CMP and a UA.
- Mmm–hmm.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.894
I know you've seen
a lot of doctors for this.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.520
I'll do my best
to be the last one.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.900
- Here you go...
- Good morning, I'm Dr. Manning.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.943
- See?
- I'm Kyle. This is my wife, Janet.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.361
- Hi.
- And the little guy is Lucas.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.739
Hey, Lucas... Hi.
(GASPS)

06:03.822 --> 06:05.949
- Peekaboo.
- Peekaboo.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.242
(ALL LAUGH)

06:07.326 --> 06:09.286
Well, he seems happy.
That's a good start.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.497
I see the bloody
nose has stopped.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.915
Can you tell me
what happened?

06:12.998 --> 06:16.335
He was at the park with his nanny
and it just started gushing.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.753
And she couldn't
reach either of us,

06:17.836 --> 06:19.713
so since they were
around the corner,

06:19.797 --> 06:21.215
she brought him here.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.258
I have a three–year–old
and a nanny, I get it.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.760
All right.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.261
Yeah, the nosebleeds
aren't a new thing.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.971
We've been dealing
with them all summer.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.182
Can I see
your nose?

06:30.265 --> 06:33.018
Turbinates are swollen
and irritated.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.728
- Seasonal allergies?
- Oh, yeah.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.522
They've been brutal for
all of us this year.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.566
For Lucas, it's nosebleeds
and this rash on his arm.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.027
(COUGHS)

06:42.111 --> 06:43.612
Oh, yeah, and
that little cough.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.948
Hey, buddy. Can you
open your mouth for me?

06:46.031 --> 06:48.534
Real wide,
like this... Aah!

06:48.617 --> 06:51.954
Good, good, good.
I am seeing evidence of post nasal drip.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.288
That's likely what's
causing the cough.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.707
- Is it worse at night?
- It was.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.252
But then we put an atomizer
with eucalyptus oil by his crib.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.419
It's helped a lot.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.005
NATALIE:
Let's take a look.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.340
All right,
let's see.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.679
He's a little wheezy.
Any fever?

07:08.762 --> 07:11.974
Yeah. He felt a little warm
yesterday morning. He...

07:12.057 --> 07:13.433
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

07:13.517 --> 07:15.435
He was fussy
at breakfast,

07:15.519 --> 07:17.771
but by lunch,
and ever since then,

07:17.855 --> 07:19.565
he's been a bundle
of energy. (CHUCKLES)

07:19.648 --> 07:20.941
Good.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.402
Is this the rash you mentioned?
JANET: Yes.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.780
Have you been using
a topical hydrocortisone cream on it?

07:26.864 --> 07:30.534
No. I've been mashing up
a chewable fish oil tablet in his yogurt.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.620
Oh, okay.
Well, if it's working.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.708
All evidence is pointing

07:37.791 --> 07:40.085
towards allergies and
an overcautious nanny.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.546
But since Lucas may have
had a fever yesterday,

07:42.629 --> 07:44.715
I would like to do
some blood tests.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.760
Is something wrong?

07:48.844 --> 07:52.556
We just have adopted a naturopathic
approach to our health care.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.099
Look, the thing
with blood tests is,

07:54.183 --> 07:57.019
they will not introduce
anything new into Lucas' system.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.813
They'll just show us
if something's there that shouldn't be.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.483
Yeah. Okay.
Go ahead.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.360
Great. I'll send
a nurse in.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.115
Maggie? Doris said
you were looking for me.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.034
Yes. I've got an appointment
this afternoon.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.119
I need you to take over
for me while I'm gone.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.371
No problem.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.456
What time
will you be back?

08:17.539 --> 08:18.832
I won't.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.000
Okay.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.127
Guess that's all
I need to know.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.507
Monique,
what am I missing?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.718
These last few weeks
Maggie's been so short with me.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.053
It's not just you.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.972
The other day I saw her sneak into
an open treatment room and lie down.

08:34.056 --> 08:37.517
So I asked her if she was
feeling okay and she bit my head off.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.810
Huh.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.608
I'm elbow–deep in this guy's belly,
and it was a big belly.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.526
Highly doubtful this fellow
ever skipped a meal.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.404
No, not surgical.

08:49.488 --> 08:53.742
So I go to sew up
a hole in the small bowel and, bam!

08:53.825 --> 08:55.786
Out pops
this critter.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.205
No lie, this thing
looked straight at me,

08:58.288 --> 09:00.499
dropped back into the bowel,
disappeared.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.294
What the hell?
What was it?

09:04.378 --> 09:05.587
A tapeworm.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.005
The biggest one
I've ever seen.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.757
Only one I ever seen.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.093
Uh, also, not surgical.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.137
So what did you do?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.305
Went after it.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.392
I stuck ringed forceps into that bowel
and I yanked that old worm out.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.559
All three feet
of him.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.646
Then I sent him off to pathology
and finished the case.

09:25.607 --> 09:29.236
(SCOFFS) If Dr. Marcel's
taking Noah under his wing,

09:29.319 --> 09:31.780
he should teach more
and brag less.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.449
Yeah, his style's
just different than yours.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.576
That's probably why
you don't like it.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.245
Come on, you buy
that tapeworm story?

09:38.328 --> 09:42.708
(LAUGHING) Come on,
Dr. Marcel may be a personality,

09:42.791 --> 09:44.543
but he's a good
surgeon.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.382
Carl's labs and
X–rays are back.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.093
What about his medical records
from his previous hospital?

09:53.176 --> 09:56.430
Still working on it.
Seems Westwood Regional went bankrupt.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.141
I've got a call into the company appointed
to handle patient affairs.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.517
- Thanks, Mo.
- Mmm–hmm.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.523
Uh–oh.
You look concerned.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.650
Your white cell count
is high.

10:08.734 --> 10:12.112
X–ray showed dilated loops of bowel
and your overall blood count is low.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.989
Means more
tests, right?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.658
- Yeah.
- So what's next?

10:16.742 --> 10:19.119
A CT angiogram
of your blood vessels

10:19.202 --> 10:20.954
and a CT with contrast
for your bowel.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.874
Did you ever have
either of these tests before?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.793
Angiogram...
I don't know, maybe.

10:26.877 --> 10:31.548
The CT with contrast, is that the scan
you drink something first?

10:31.631 --> 10:36.219
Ugh. Then I've had one of them.
Didn't like that drink at all.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.263
Well, unfortunately,
it hasn't gotten any better.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.058
(SCOFFS)
- Sorry, man. I'll go put in the order.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.225
Thanks.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.489
Hey, so in T Four...

10:58.367 --> 10:59.659
...something worth
looking into.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.746
MARCEL: Mmm–hmm.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.417
Don't forget. Don't forget.
Don't forget.

11:07.501 --> 11:11.671
Don't forget legal research regarding
contractor's negligence for the complaint.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.049
- Issue. Rule.
ROSADO: Eunice Kim, 25.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.343
First year associate
at some big time law firm.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.636
Anyway, her roommate called us

11:17.719 --> 11:20.389
when the ranting and the pacing started
to annoy the neighbors.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.809
She say anything about
the last time she slept?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.685
Yeah, been
at least two days.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.146
When we showed up, she was screaming
at herself in the mirror.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.981
- We tried to calm her, but...
- Yeah.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.942
- She wasn't having any of that.
- Yeah.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.235
Find any drugs
in the apartment?

11:33.318 --> 11:36.071
Nope. Tons of books,
nothing sketchy.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.531
Charges pending?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.491
Figured you could help
more than lock–up.

11:39.574 --> 11:40.909
I appreciate it.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.954
Hey, let's get some
M–tabs for Eunice.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.501
EUNICE: Don't forget.
Don't forget! Don't forget.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.752
- Eunice, how you doing?
- Get legal research...

11:50.836 --> 11:52.796
- I'm Dr. Charles.
- ...regarding contractor's negligence.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.464
- IRAC. Issue. Rule. IRAC.
DANIEL: Eunice?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.758
- IRAC. IRAC.
- Eunice!

11:56.842 --> 11:58.760
Hey! How you doing?
I'm Dr. Charles.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.512
You think we could maybe
sit and talk a bit?

12:00.595 --> 12:03.390
Only a moment, I don't have
anything more to spare.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.517
I got it. A motion to strike
the affirmative defense.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.893
- Eunice...
- Wait, can't do that

12:06.977 --> 12:08.311
because there is a genuine issue
of material fact.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.438
- Gotta do discovery...
- Eunice!

12:09.521 --> 12:11.565
I can see you're under
a whole lot of pressure.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.277
I'd like to give you some medicine
to help you calm down a bit,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.237
you know, maybe
think more clearly.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.573
- Think more clearly.
- Yeah.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.825
- That might help.
- Okay.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.035
- (CHUCKLES) I need to organize.
- Yeah.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.080
I don't know where I am.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.082
You're in
a safe place, Eunice.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.130
(CELL PHONE CHIMES, BUZZES)

12:42.596 --> 12:43.930
- What's going on?
- He's losing it.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.683
I need to get out!
How much longer till we get the scan?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.727
- Twenty seconds.
- Two milligrams of midazolam.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.395
Carl, it's Dr. Choi.
We're almost done.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.730
I'm gonna be sick.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.650
Slow breaths.
Only ten more seconds.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.776
I'm not gonna make it.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.612
Yes, you can.
You can do this, Carl.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.991
Five seconds.
Four, three,

13:03.074 --> 13:05.577
two, one. You good?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.579
Get him out.
Get him out. Get him out.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.042
You did it, Carl.

13:12.918 --> 13:13.919
Good job, buddy.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.214
It's over.
Good job.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.133
(VOMITING)

13:20.842 --> 13:22.969
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, hey.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.054
It's all right.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.556
Good job, man.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.526
I mean, that's not
a normal calf, right?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.903
Yeah, it's swollen.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.447
- And you didn't injure it?
- Nope. Nothing.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.784
I went to bed, it was fine. Woke up,
thing's a grapefruit.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.495
Press against my hand.
One to ten, how bad's the pain?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.373
I'd say a seven,
maybe an eight.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.416
That's in line with what
I'm thinking. Blood clot.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.294
It's called a DVT,
deep vein thrombosis.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.629
Seriously? Me?

13:57.712 --> 14:01.883
I exercise a few times a week.
I don't sit for long periods of time.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.553
Yeah, unfortunately,
not fitting the profile

14:04.636 --> 14:05.971
doesn't mean you
can't develop one.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.430
(SIGHS)

14:07.514 --> 14:10.225
Beating the odds.
Lucky me. (CHUCKLES)

14:11.434 --> 14:14.980
CBC, BMP, protein C, S
and Factor V Leiden.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.483
Let's get Mr. Bowe a DVT scan
and put him on a heparin drip.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.609
I'll check on you in a bit.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.237
Dr. Halstead,
before you leave,

14:22.320 --> 14:23.530
can you grab my phone?

14:23.613 --> 14:24.823
Front pocket of my jeans.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.535
- Sure.
- I kept the swollen calf under wraps

14:28.618 --> 14:31.037
'cause I didn't want
my fiancée to freak out.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.874
But I think we're to the point where
I'd better let her know what's going on.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.126
Got you.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.504
(GROANS)

14:40.880 --> 14:42.424
Oh, man.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.175
(GROANS)

14:44.259 --> 14:45.802
That's one
angry belly.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.512
What's going on?

14:48.430 --> 14:51.349
- Surgical consult.
- I didn't call for one.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.393
It was only
a matter of time.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.477
Good find, Noah.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.813
Dr. Marcel, Dr. Sexton,
can I speak with you outside?

15:01.943 --> 15:05.155
All this stalking around the ED,
peeking in on patients.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.407
You hanging outside
Carl's room earlier,

15:07.490 --> 15:08.867
you were sniffing
for surgical cases.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.620
And Noah's your intern.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.663
Best you could do is show him
how to poach patients?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.999
Whoa. Poaching
implies stealing.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.917
Hardly think that
applies in Carl's case,

15:18.001 --> 15:20.337
seeing as how you were
gonna call us anyway.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.422
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

15:22.505 --> 15:25.675
Dr. Choi, Carl's belly was so hot
it nearly burned my hands.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.928
There's an issue in there
that requires surgical attention.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.305
Or do my hands
deceive me?

15:31.222 --> 15:34.100
No. CT showed a partial
small bowel obstruction

15:34.184 --> 15:35.393
with a likely
transition point.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.855
- So it is surgical.
- Possibly.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.568
The CT imagery is poor because Carl
was agitated during the scan.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.654
I'm not comfortable
making any treatment decisions

15:45.737 --> 15:48.239
before I know exactly
what's causing the obstruction.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.493
So I'm ordering an MRI.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.328
Pending the results,

15:53.411 --> 15:56.206
I'll let you know
if a surgical consult is needed.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.291
Okay.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.044
I apologize
for overstepping.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.296
Protocol, etiquette,

16:03.380 --> 16:04.756
they mean something.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.383
I'll do better at
remembering that.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.551
Okay.

16:16.101 --> 16:19.396
Doris, any word from
the lab on Lucas' tests?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.190
Not yet. Word's out your
case screams allergies.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.650
It's probably
last in line.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.361
Maggie?

16:27.320 --> 16:31.074
MAGGIE: Yeah.
- There are patients waiting to be seen

16:31.157 --> 16:33.410
and I have absolutely
nothing going on.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.121
Light case load.
Lanik was very clear.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.664
This is ridiculous.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.833
Then talk to Lanik
and stop bugging me.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.253
Because you're giving me
one more headache that I don't need.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.671
Okay.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.632
Look, I'm sorry.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.760
I've somewhere to be
and I can't be late.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.139
April, I'm leaving.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.145
Eunice, how you doing?

17:00.228 --> 17:04.065
I'm happy
to see that, um,

17:04.149 --> 17:05.483
you seem to be
a little better.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.571
Embarrassed
is more like it.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.158
It's all a blur,
but I know I wasn't

17:14.409 --> 17:15.410
myself.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.580
I understand how...
How scary that can feel.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.666
It can't happen again.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.086
Now on, no matter how busy I am,
I'll make time for sleep.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.838
I mean, sleep is crucial.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.925
But counseling, medication,
other lifestyle changes

17:31.009 --> 17:32.927
are all things that
we need to talk about.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.597
Little extreme, no?

17:35.680 --> 17:38.516
I mean, I had a panic attack,
not a nervous breakdown.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.684
It wasn't
a panic attack.

17:39.768 --> 17:42.937
I'm quite sure that you were experiencing
a manic episode, Eunice,

17:43.021 --> 17:45.440
symptomatic of
bipolar disorder.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.819
No, no, no...

17:49.903 --> 17:51.780
I can't have bipolar.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.448
I have $300,000

17:53.531 --> 17:55.658
in student loans and my salary
doesn't even make a dent.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.660
I need to make partner.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.120
Takes most lawyers
five years,

17:59.204 --> 18:00.663
I'm on track
to do it in three.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.751
Can't you just give me
more of that medication?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.085
Or something else?

18:06.169 --> 18:10.256
Well, thing is, bipolar disorder
doesn't really work that way.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.300
Unless you address it
comprehensively,

18:12.383 --> 18:14.636
the manic episodes
will likely return.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.055
They'll increase in intensity
and can even be followed

18:17.138 --> 18:19.557
- by cycles of depression...
- But I know the signs now.

18:19.641 --> 18:23.770
I can get out in front
of it if I start to feel off, control it.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.189
I don't think anybody
can control this.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.608
You know, not even somebody
as determined as you.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.070
But, Eunice, you can absolutely
learn how to manage it.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.446
Why don't you
let me admit you

18:33.530 --> 18:35.657
and let's start looking
for a stable medication?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.408
No. I'd like
to be discharged.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.869
Today's not
a wash yet.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.746
I can still put in some face time
at the firm.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.629
Look, I know the criteria
for involuntary commitment.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.383
Legally, you can't
keep me here.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.636
(SIGHS)

19:04.602 --> 19:06.563
Does the furrow
of your brow

19:06.646 --> 19:09.190
suggest a surgical
consult is now needed?

19:10.859 --> 19:14.070
MRI revealed a focal solitary mass
in the distal pancreas.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.697
- May be a cyst.
- I concur.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.908
Gotta assume it's what's riling
Carl's belly up so fiercely.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.035
He needs a distal
pancreatectomy.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.371
You take out the section
of the pancreas housing the mass,

19:23.454 --> 19:25.039
no more
chaos downstream.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.499
That is a huge
procedure.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.961
Not to mention, it won't do a thing
for Carl if the mass isn't the issue.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.213
If the mass isn't the problem,
then what are we looking at?

19:32.297 --> 19:33.715
Carl's been
suffering for years.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.717
The mass could have
been there the whole time, unchanged,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.260
which means it's
likely not a factor.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.721
Or the mass has been
growing over time.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.931
We leave it in,
the inflammation worsens,

19:42.015 --> 19:43.308
the bowel
completely obstructs,

19:43.391 --> 19:45.226
then perforates
and Carl becomes septic.

19:45.310 --> 19:49.314
The first step of that
potentially fatal catastrophe is a fever,

19:49.397 --> 19:51.024
which, by the
looks of him,

19:51.107 --> 19:52.483
has set in.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.029
100.6.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.531
- But holding.
- Yeah, for now.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.158
You operate on his pancreas
and you're wrong,

20:00.241 --> 20:01.576
it does way more
harm than good.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.995
- But if I'm correct, he lives.
- And I don't like if's.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.458
Carl will be treated medicinally
until his previous scans arrive

20:08.541 --> 20:10.752
and I can compare them
against today's MRI.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.045
That's gonna
be a problem.

20:13.129 --> 20:17.091
His medical records from
Westwood Regional are being held hostage.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.477
This is a mess.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.354
You know, Westwood
Regional's bankruptcy

20:29.437 --> 20:32.273
has created the legal equivalent
of a battle royale.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.901
MRS. Medical
Record Services.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.695
I'm assuming they control
Westwood's patient charts?

20:37.779 --> 20:40.865
Correct. It's MRS
that have the files on lockdown,

20:40.949 --> 20:43.159
they're actually threatening
to destroy them.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.869
My main concern
right now is Carl.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.579
My opinion
is not changed.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.415
His distal pancreas is wreaking havoc
and it needs to come out.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.085
Without Carl's previous scans,
which it's clear we're not gonna get,

20:52.168 --> 20:53.294
you can't prove
that's the fix.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.339
No, I cannot.
Then you shouldn't operate.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.967
The pancreas is the most
unforgiving organ in the body.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.594
The potential for surgical complications
is through the roof.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.681
True. But God
only gave us so many heartbeats.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.058
No sense in Carl
running out of his early.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.768
Excuse me?
Is there something going on here

21:08.851 --> 21:09.894
that I should
know about?

21:09.978 --> 21:11.145
MARCEL: Nothing
I'm aware of.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.647
Dr. Choi?

21:16.317 --> 21:18.778
Then give me
recommendations.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.656
Let me operate now

21:21.739 --> 21:23.700
before his bowel perforates
and it's too late.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.786
Ms. Goodwin, it's a risky procedure
that may be unnecessary.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.496
Let me admit Carl
for more tests.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.583
JANET: Hon?
- Hi.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.628
I'm sorry, the lab took
longer than expected.

21:35.712 --> 21:40.717
So, Lucas' BUN, creatinine
and white cell count are all elevated.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.386
- That suggests dehydration.
(COUGHS)

21:44.303 --> 21:46.389
And between
the white cell count,

21:46.472 --> 21:48.599
his persistent cough
and the post nasal drip,

21:48.683 --> 21:51.102
it's likely a bacterial
sinus infection.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.187
- Okay. Thanks, Dr. Manning.
- Yeah.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.314
So, what do you think?

21:55.398 --> 21:57.358
We could make popsicles
from coconut water.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.027
That should help
with the dehydration.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.446
Yeah, maybe add an
herbal antihistamine, too.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.906
I can pick up some powdered quercetin
at the farmer's market.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.033
Great.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.785
I'm sorry, perhaps
a more immediate treatment...

22:07.869 --> 22:10.413
You mean antibiotics?
No. Not after last time.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.457
Lucas had an ear
infection last year.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.333
The doctor prescribed
amoxicillin.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.836
One dose and he broke out
in hives everywhere.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.755
I mean, his recovery
from the antibiotic

22:18.838 --> 22:20.631
was worse than
the ear infection.

22:20.715 --> 22:21.758
And since then,

22:21.841 --> 22:23.551
if there are natural options
without side effects,

22:23.634 --> 22:25.011
we try those first.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.848
Look, like you two, my son's health
comes before anything else.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.559
But, you know, sometimes
there's just some things

22:31.642 --> 22:33.603
that a holistic approach
alone won't cure.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.439
We agree. A sinus infection
isn't one of them, though.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.732
You're right.

22:37.815 --> 22:42.528
Over time, natural remedies may help
his immune system resolve the infection.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.739
But the dehydration...

22:44.822 --> 22:47.200
Lucas needs
more than popsicles.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.577
At least let me give him
an electrolyte drink.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.120
How much?

22:51.204 --> 22:53.456
Twenty–four ounces
to sip throughout the day.

22:53.539 --> 22:56.125
Twenty–four ounces through a sippy cup,
he won't do it.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.210
Is there another way?

22:57.293 --> 22:58.544
Saline IV.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.505
I know
it's another needle,

23:00.588 --> 23:02.840
but no side effects,
I promise.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.635
(SIGHS)

23:05.718 --> 23:07.386
Saline, but no
antibiotics.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.472
Understood.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.140
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.603
NEAL: Dr. Halstead,
the blood thinner,

23:15.686 --> 23:17.021
I don't think it's working.

23:17.105 --> 23:21.025
The calf's still huge and my foot's
starting to swell up, too.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.402
You having
trouble breathing?

23:23.486 --> 23:25.113
More like winded.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.662
I wanna send you for a CT.
I gotta get a better look at that clot.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.082
This will help you
breathe better.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.084
Get a hold
of your fiancée?

23:38.167 --> 23:39.252
Voicemail.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.462
She's still looking
at dresses.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.172
Pretty sure she's not
checking her phone.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.759
- So, when's the big day?
- Spring.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.345
Still debating locations.

23:50.721 --> 23:51.722
Well, congratulations.

23:52.849 --> 23:53.850
Techs will be
by in a few.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.854
SHARON: The surgery,
it's your choice.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.897
- Okay. All right.
- Thank you.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.903
So, I explained both
of your positions.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.990
Philosophically,
he agrees with you, Dr. Choi,

24:09.073 --> 24:11.534
preferring
a conservative approach.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.703
But, realistically,
he's in pain

24:13.786 --> 24:15.496
and desperate
to feel better.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.582
So he chose the surgery.

24:17.665 --> 24:21.127
Dr. Marcel, Mr. Harris
is now your patient.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.675
All right,
let's do this.

24:28.593 --> 24:29.886
See you in the OR.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.349
This is huge.

24:49.864 --> 24:50.865
Eunice?

24:53.075 --> 24:54.076
You're right.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.163
I can't control this.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.542
I need help.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.130
Well, you're
gonna get it.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.509
Come on.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.105
How long
will the CT take?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.566
Just a few moments.
You'll be back before you know it.

25:25.650 --> 25:29.946
Okay, because I haven't been able
to reach my fiancée

25:30.029 --> 25:32.865
and my phone's at,
like, 4%.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.700
I'll call her.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.118
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.538
Her name's Aubrey.
Number's my emergency contact.

25:39.622 --> 25:40.623
Got it.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.422
- Wait, now you think it's pneumonia?
- It's a possibility.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.424
We thought you were gonna tell us
we could go home.

25:50.508 --> 25:53.094
I mean,
Lucas isn't dehydrated anymore, right?

25:53.177 --> 25:56.764
Right, but he is still wheezing
and his temperature has ticked up.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.809
The nurse said he was 99.3.
Is that even a fever?

25:59.892 --> 26:03.062
He looks fine.
He's up, he's active.

26:03.145 --> 26:06.107
On the outside,
he may look normal, but on the inside,

26:06.190 --> 26:09.277
pneumonia is notorious
for its slow progression.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.987
Or it is just
a sinus infection,

26:11.070 --> 26:13.447
which you've been saying all day until,
apparently, right now.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.699
JANET: Okay.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.744
How would you know for sure
if it's pneumonia or not?

26:18.828 --> 26:20.329
A chest X–ray.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.789
KYLE: You're kidding,
right?

26:21.872 --> 26:23.624
We said no
to antibiotics.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.377
We're definitely not letting you zap
Lucas full of radiation.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.795
These hospitals.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.797
You scare people
with diagnoses

26:29.880 --> 26:31.674
and then you sell them on treatments
they don't need

26:31.757 --> 26:33.092
that actually
make them sicker.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.677
Dr. Manning, we'd like
to go home. Okay?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.846
If Lucas doesn't improve,
we'll take him to our doctor.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.347
Your doctor?

26:38.431 --> 26:40.308
An actual MD?

26:41.434 --> 26:43.060
No. He's a holistic healer.

26:43.811 --> 26:47.982
So his answer for pneumonia's gonna
be what, oil of oregano?

26:48.065 --> 26:49.442
Horseradish with lemon?

26:49.525 --> 26:51.861
Look, you don't agree
with alternative medicine, fine.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.822
- But don't insult us.
- I'm not. I'm trying to inform you.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.407
WILL: Dr. Manning?
- Yes.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.117
Speak with you
a moment?

26:58.951 --> 26:59.994
Please excuse me.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.460
What's going on?

27:07.543 --> 27:10.755
My boy with the bloody
nose, it may very well be pneumonia,

27:10.838 --> 27:12.840
but his parents won't allow me
to do a chest X–ray.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.592
They would rather go home

27:14.675 --> 27:16.510
and take their chances
with herbs and teas.

27:16.594 --> 27:17.845
Let me see the chart.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.685
Yeah, these symptoms, okay,
pneumonia has to be on the differential.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.687
- Yeah.
- Let me talk to them.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.397
Okay.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.482
Alone.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.157
I'm the
attending physician.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.408
We don't know.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.327
These tests are the only
way to provide us...

27:43.913 --> 27:46.415
- Do what you need to do.
- Thank you for working with us.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.500
Yeah.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.087
They agreed to
the chest X–ray.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.340
This is the second
time this month

27:54.423 --> 27:56.717
that parents have lost faith
in your judgment.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.260
They may be
upset now,

27:58.344 --> 28:00.554
they won't be
when I'm right.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.307
I gotta tell you, these labs,
they look like a sinus infection.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.726
So you'd better be right
that it's pneumonia.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.573
CAROLINE: Hello, hello, hello.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.244
This is your last week?

28:23.327 --> 28:24.495
WOMAN: Oh, girlie.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.706
You're looking good!
Girlfriend's a champ!

28:29.250 --> 28:30.876
WOMAN: You still walk
around in my sweater.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.879
(CAROLINE CHUCKLES)
Thank you. That's a good catch.

28:37.842 --> 28:38.884
(SOFTLY) Maggie.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.054
Caroline.

28:44.014 --> 28:45.933
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.229
No one does,
except for Sharon.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.773
And I'd like to keep it
that way, please.

28:52.857 --> 28:54.316
Yeah.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.609
I've been there.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.488
You mind if I sit?

29:00.489 --> 29:04.326
Girl, you got a whole bag hanging.
You ain't going nowhere no time quick.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.328
(SCOFFS)

29:07.705 --> 29:08.706
Okay.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.417
Come on.
Come on.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.961
Come on.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.093
So, where's the badness?

29:21.177 --> 29:23.012
In my breast.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.014
And what's
the prognosis?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.892
Still waiting to see how I respond
to chemo stage.

29:27.975 --> 29:28.976
I've been there.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.939
Sisters in arms.
(CHUCKLES)

29:34.023 --> 29:37.026
So, you know this keeping a secret thing,
it's not gonna...

29:37.109 --> 29:38.444
It's not gonna be
that easy, right?

29:38.527 --> 29:40.738
- I'm managing.
- Oh!

29:40.821 --> 29:44.783
That cancer's a heavy lift and I know
it sounds like a cliché,

29:44.867 --> 29:47.286
but there's strength
in community.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.121
And pity.

29:49.205 --> 29:51.540
- Mmm–hmm.
- And obligation.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.001
- And I don't want any of that.
- I hear you.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.087
And I was afraid to
tell my friends, too.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.882
But once I let 'em in,

30:00.799 --> 30:02.301
I let my friends
be my friends.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.472
That was a real comfort.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.940
It's time to heal
with steel, Dr. Sexton.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.692
Incision is yours.
What's it gonna be?

30:19.860 --> 30:22.196
- Midline...
- Is that a question or a statement?

30:22.279 --> 30:23.572
Midline.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.241
Okay. Then what?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.493
Divide and tie off
the falciform ligament.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.702
Keep going.

30:28.786 --> 30:30.162
Eviscerate the patient

30:30.246 --> 30:33.582
and find the transition point
of the small bowel.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.126
I like what I'm hearing.
Don't stop now.

30:37.044 --> 30:40.297
We open the lesser sack
and take down the lienocolic ligament...

30:40.381 --> 30:41.465
MARCEL: (SOFTLY) Hey, Carl.

30:41.549 --> 30:42.925
- I'm gonna take good care of you.
- Dr. Marcel?

30:43.008 --> 30:44.093
I'm gonna be by your side
the whole time, Carl.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.844
- What are you doing?
- Okay?

30:47.429 --> 30:48.639
This isn't
an easy surgery.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.600
I'm just letting Carl know
that we're gonna take special care of him.

30:51.684 --> 30:52.935
You think he can hear you?

30:53.018 --> 30:54.520
Unsure.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.398
But what the body can't hear,
perhaps the soul can.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.568
That said, Carl needs to know exactly
what's gonna happen.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.653
So continue,
Dr. Sexton.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.447
NOAH: Isolate the spleen,

31:05.531 --> 31:10.744
put a curved eight around the hilum
and then take the spleen out.

31:10.828 --> 31:14.290
From there we mobilize
the distal pancreas

31:14.373 --> 31:16.208
and put a TA 90
stapler across it.

31:16.292 --> 31:19.044
MARCEL: Okay.
Let's get started.

31:28.596 --> 31:29.847
Hey!

31:29.930 --> 31:32.016
- Hey!
- Sorry I'm late. Patient surprised me.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.018
- In a good way.
- Hey.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.311
Not always the case.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.855
Mmm.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.940
How you doing?
How's your day going?

31:40.774 --> 31:42.026
You know what?

31:43.319 --> 31:44.862
I am so happy.

31:45.779 --> 31:48.532
You know? I wish everyone
could feel this way.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.493
Nice.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.414
You know what?
Let's make some lasagna.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.790
I wanna make some.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.083
I love your lasagna.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.753
(CHUCKLES)
- I do.

32:01.962 --> 32:05.090
All right, let's invite Sharon over.
It'd be nice to hang out with friends.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.884
- Done.
- I love that.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.553
Come on, lasagna.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.016
Thank you.

32:15.351 --> 32:16.393
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

32:32.117 --> 32:34.953
Nurse moved me up
to the oxygen mask,

32:35.037 --> 32:37.373
- but I still can hardly breathe.
- Yeah.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.709
Your CT shows
a large proximal pulmonary embolism.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.879
Okay, that means your blood clot
from your leg has moved to your lungs.

32:45.381 --> 32:46.840
I played
tennis yesterday.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.510
Now, I don't have
the energy to sit up.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.553
Why is this happening,
Dr. Halstead?

32:51.637 --> 32:54.139
Well, we'll figure that out later.
Right now, we need to deal with that clot.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.433
I'm gonna send you up
to IR to treat it endoscopically.

32:56.517 --> 32:57.893
Okay? Let's go.

32:57.976 --> 33:03.482
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Were you able
to get in touch with my fiancée, Aubrey?

33:06.235 --> 33:09.405
No, and I'm really sorry.
I was about to and I got pulled away.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.657
I promise I will call her
soon as you're on the move.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.203

33:16.286 --> 33:18.914
- Neal?

33:18.997 --> 33:19.998
Neal!

33:22.126 --> 33:23.585
No pulse.
VF on the monitors. Bag him.

33:27.423 --> 33:28.757
Paddles. Charge to 200.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.887
Charged.

33:35.264 --> 33:40.060
- Clear.

33:41.103 --> 33:42.271
Epi. One milligram.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.443
Epi's in.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.779
Okay, here we go.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.073
- Clear.
NURSE: Clear.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.871
No, no, no.
Another round of epi.

Damn it!

34:24.897 --> 34:26.815
Time of death, 17:48.

34:48.796 --> 34:50.506
Tough one, Halstead.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.840
But don't sweat
the review.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.927
I looked over the chart and the PE
is clearly the cause of death.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.346
There's nothing
you could've done.

34:57.429 --> 35:01.141
Dr. Halstead,
Neal's fiancée Aubrey just arrived.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.977
Hello? Mama,
I'm here.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.774
I don't know, they're not
telling me anything.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.822
I don't know
who to find.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.074
Can you please
just come now?

35:28.418 --> 35:29.837
No complications.

35:30.712 --> 35:33.507
Lucky for us, too,
'cause Carl's bowel was in bad shape.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.675
Dr. Marcel

35:34.758 --> 35:37.010
- was right to push for surgery.
- Yeah. He was right.

35:37.094 --> 35:38.220
- Yeah.
- This time.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.514
But Dr. Marcel's style,
the risks he's willing to take...

35:40.597 --> 35:44.101
Man, Ethan,
can't you even enjoy the moment, man?

35:45.060 --> 35:46.645
I mean, we won.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.105
We saved his life.

35:48.981 --> 35:50.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.321
- Okay.
- Noah. Noah!

36:00.617 --> 36:03.412
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

36:04.288 --> 36:05.330
I should be
celebrating.

36:05.414 --> 36:06.790
If we'd waited
like I wanted,

36:06.874 --> 36:09.001
Carl's bowel would
have perforated.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.169
- Well, it turned out okay.
- Yeah. Noah...

36:13.255 --> 36:15.173
I want you to succeed,
you know that.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.970
After two years
at Dr. Choi boot camp,

36:20.053 --> 36:21.805
and what I've seen
from Dr. Marcel,

36:22.890 --> 36:24.516
don't know
why I wouldn't.

36:33.734 --> 36:37.237
You ever need anything,
questions, advice,

36:37.321 --> 36:38.614
just wanna talk
something out...

36:38.697 --> 36:40.198
Yeah. I know
where to find you.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.286
I gotta get back
to recovery.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.079
Want to be there
when Carl wakes up.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.790
Go, go.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.132
(CHUCKLES)
Or maybe you can't go to bed.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.258
Why?

37:00.010 --> 37:01.178
Maggie?

37:02.512 --> 37:03.805
You okay?

37:07.184 --> 37:08.769
Maggie,
what's going on?

37:55.774 --> 37:56.775
Honey?

37:57.359 --> 37:58.694
CAROLINE: I'm in the kitchen.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.697
Are you sure that we don't need
any more wine?

38:01.780 --> 38:04.282
It's very easy for me
to just sort of jump back...

38:07.202 --> 38:09.579
- Hey, Bert.
- Hey! Wine's covered, Dan.

38:09.663 --> 38:10.789
Got red and white.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.042
I know both go well
with CeCe's lasagna.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.961
CAROLINE: Honey? Honey,
dinner's almost ready.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.714
So will you set the table?
The dishes are already out there, please.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.800
Mmm. Let me.
The least I can do.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.093
Thanks, Bert.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.512
BERT: Good to see you, pal.
- Hey, man.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.931
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm good. Good, yeah.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.477
Sharon's gonna be here,
like, any minute.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.062
Why didn't you tell me
Bert was coming?

38:34.146 --> 38:36.356
(SOFTLY) Because if I told,
I know you wouldn't invite her.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.692
And three people don't exactly
make a couples dinner party.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.486
Couples?
What are you doing?

38:41.570 --> 38:43.864
I do not wanna hear how you
think this is a bad idea.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.283
It is way beyond a bad idea.
It's atrocious.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.701
Okay, yes,
I am meddling.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.620
And I would've preferred
to warm Sharon up to the idea,

38:50.704 --> 38:52.873
but I happen to be
a little short on time.

38:52.956 --> 38:54.624
You cannot spring this
on them unannounced.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.251
These two people went
through a terrible divorce.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.211
They haven't talked to
each other for a year.

38:58.295 --> 38:59.546
Danny, you and I found
our way back to each other.

38:59.629 --> 39:00.714
That's completely
different.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.841
Who says that Sharon and Bert
can't do the same thing?

39:02.924 --> 39:05.135
I just want them
to be happy. That's it.

39:05.218 --> 39:06.511
Well, you can't
manipulate people

39:06.595 --> 39:08.764
into doing what you want
if it's not what they want.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.652
SHARON: Hey.

39:22.736 --> 39:28.867
I remembered that CeCe's lasagna pairs
well with both red and white, so...

39:28.950 --> 39:30.452
That's right,
it does.

39:30.535 --> 39:33.830
It's good with red
and with white.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.626
And rosé.

Sharon!

Bert.

39:50.347 --> 39:51.807
So, who's hungry?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.897
You said an X–ray
would confirm pneumonia.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.149
- I thought it would.
- But you still aren't sure?

40:01.233 --> 40:04.027
And now you wanna try to pump our son
full of antibiotics again?

40:04.111 --> 40:05.612
To be safe, yes.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.531
No. We have been
here for hours

40:07.614 --> 40:09.491
agreeing to things
we're not comfortable with.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.785
No more.
We're going home.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.454

approve that discharge.

our lawyer.

Lucas most likely
has pneumonia.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.010
He needs these
antibiotics, now!

- No!
