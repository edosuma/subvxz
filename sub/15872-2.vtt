<i>The Lying Game...</i>

00:01.752 --> 00:02.885
My twin sister.

00:02.919 --> 00:04.720
I just can't wait
to finally meet you.

00:04.755 --> 00:05.721
(police siren chirps)

00:05.756 --> 00:06.922
OFFICER:
Stop right there!

00:06.957 --> 00:08.891
My pervy foster brother
set me up,

00:08.925 --> 00:11.861
and I have nowhere else to go.
We need to change clothes.

00:11.895 --> 00:13.729
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.464
You-you-you want me
to take your place.

00:15.499 --> 00:16.665
Two days.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.933
Just hang
out, relax.

00:17.968 --> 00:19.635
I'm gonna find our real parents.

00:19.669 --> 00:20.636
You've been
a little different

00:20.670 --> 00:21.737
since we got back.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.839
So people have been telling me.

00:23.874 --> 00:26.609
Even your real mother
didn't want you.

00:26.643 --> 00:28.602
Someone broke into the house,
into your room.

00:28.627 --> 00:29.930
The laptop's gone.

00:30.514 --> 00:34.517
Ah, yes, Scottsdale's
own Ethan Whitehorse.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.852
You're not Sutton.

00:36.887 --> 00:39.588
Sutton didn't want me
to tell anybody.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.824
We both have to keep it up
until she comes back.

00:41.858 --> 00:43.993
(door opens, Emma gasps)

00:51.501 --> 00:53.502
(soft groan)

01:03.547 --> 01:04.780
(sighs)

01:25.836 --> 01:27.937
(phone rings)

01:41.618 --> 01:44.487
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have one new message.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.855
Hey, Emma. Travis again.

01:45.889 --> 01:48.791
Still not returning my calls.

01:48.825 --> 01:52.661
But so you know, Vegas P.D.'s
still on the case.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.864
KRISTIN: Sutton,
breakfast!

01:54.898 --> 01:58.667
It's such a weird feeling,
someone actually breaking in.

01:58.702 --> 02:02.438
Well, I still say it was
just some kid, though.

02:02.472 --> 02:04.773
I mean, all they took
was Sutton's laptop?

02:04.808 --> 02:06.375
Morning.

02:06.409 --> 02:07.710
You sleep okay?

02:07.744 --> 02:10.812
Pretty good... considering.

02:10.847 --> 02:12.748
I have a glass guy
coming later, okay?

02:12.782 --> 02:14.617
So we will get back
to normal

02:14.651 --> 02:16.619
so we can now start
focusing on Sunday.

02:16.653 --> 02:18.387
Unless you girls
have forgotten?

02:18.421 --> 02:20.856
LAUREL: Forgotten the
father/daughter dance?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.691
That's unlikely.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.560
Let's see what you got,
Sutton. Let's go.

02:24.594 --> 02:27.563
All right, ready?
Three, two, one.

02:27.597 --> 02:28.898
(humming)

02:30.433 --> 02:32.668
Now spin. Ho!

02:32.702 --> 02:34.470
There we go.

02:34.504 --> 02:35.604
(humming)

02:35.639 --> 02:37.673
Then we spin.

02:37.707 --> 02:39.542
She's forgotten!

02:39.576 --> 02:41.477
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

02:41.511 --> 02:44.647
I have to get ready for...
school.

03:05.835 --> 03:07.570
Let me guess.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.405
You're going back to Vegas?

03:09.439 --> 03:10.806
Los Angeles to find Sutton.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.441
Something happened.
I can feel it.

03:12.475 --> 03:14.410
As for Vegas, I
can never go back.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.647
They'll put me in-in jail
or that house with Travis.

03:18.682 --> 03:21.417
If they catch me here,
pretending to be my twin...

03:21.451 --> 03:22.818
Do you have any idea
how hard this is?

03:22.852 --> 03:26.488
I start to think that I can
actually do this, and then

03:26.523 --> 03:29.725
I am blindsided by some family
tradition or Suttonism.

03:29.759 --> 03:32.428
Sutton said she was close
to finding your real mother.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.862
She also said
that she was going to meet me

03:33.897 --> 03:35.598
at the cabin last night.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.600
But while we were there,
somebody broke in here.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.436
That laptop--
my one key

03:40.470 --> 03:42.471
to Sutton-- gone.

03:42.505 --> 03:43.706
Only thing stolen.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.507
Right now you've just got to

03:45.542 --> 03:46.775
trust me on this,
all right?

03:46.810 --> 03:48.544
You know, that's another thing:

03:48.578 --> 03:50.479
Why should I trust you?

03:50.513 --> 03:53.716
Because right now I am the
only person you can trust.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.451
You just can't worry
about Sutton, all right?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.585
That girl can
take care of herself.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.786
She can handle anything.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.488
(knocking)

04:01.524 --> 04:02.725
(sighs)

04:04.794 --> 04:06.762
Hi.
Hey.

04:06.796 --> 04:09.531
Thought you could use my laptop
till we get a replacement.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.400
I'll use the hospital's
in the meantime.

04:13.703 --> 04:15.404
- You okay?.
- Wow, that's really nice.

04:15.438 --> 04:17.505
'Course I am. Yeah.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.476
Sutton Mercer,
she can handle anything.

04:53.190 --> 04:55.971
Figured I'd skip the
daddy-daughter dance this year.

04:55.972 --> 04:57.673
At least that's
what I told Mom.

04:57.707 --> 04:58.707
What? You're
kidding.

04:58.742 --> 05:01.610
No. I need you there.

05:01.645 --> 05:05.547
Did you just say "need,"
you need me?

05:05.582 --> 05:07.516
Okay, cool, here it is.

05:07.550 --> 05:08.751
Smackdown at the Randall house
last night.

05:08.785 --> 05:10.653
Someone got you slapping Nisha.

05:10.687 --> 05:14.723
Gonna be seriously viral
by the time we get to school.

05:14.758 --> 05:15.508
PDR? "Public
display of rage."

05:15.509 --> 05:17.443
I mean, that's guaranteed
celebutante status.

05:17.697 --> 05:19.765
Great.

05:19.799 --> 05:23.535
Oh, uh... Okay, sure, right,
why stop for coffee

05:23.570 --> 05:26.772
like we've been doing every
morning for the last two years?

05:26.806 --> 05:28.574
Sorry. I-I--
skipping the caffeine.

05:28.608 --> 05:30.676
Just feeling a little freaked
from the break-in

05:30.710 --> 05:32.778
and my laptop being stolen.

05:32.812 --> 05:34.480
My guess is that

05:34.514 --> 05:36.415
they were looking
for the "lying games,"

05:36.449 --> 05:37.783
or at least one in particular.

05:37.817 --> 05:39.618
You kept them on there, right?

05:39.652 --> 05:43.388
Uh... uh, yeah, I might have.

05:43.423 --> 05:44.623
Translating...

05:44.657 --> 05:46.425
you did.

05:49.496 --> 05:52.431
Whoever it was broke in
through a window.

05:52.465 --> 05:54.433
- Too much drama.
- Yeah. Uh-oh.

05:54.467 --> 05:55.734
Bad boy ahead.

05:55.769 --> 05:57.469
He's kind of
hot, though.

05:57.504 --> 05:59.338
Mads!

06:01.741 --> 06:03.742
(girls laughing)

06:07.347 --> 06:08.547
(all laughing)

06:23.530 --> 06:24.730
What do you want?

06:24.764 --> 06:28.433
I'm really sorry about
this whole video thing

06:28.468 --> 06:29.601
and that it's out there...

06:29.636 --> 06:31.336
that it was even made.

06:31.371 --> 06:33.739
Uh-huh, sure, you are.

06:33.773 --> 06:35.274
No, really.

06:35.308 --> 06:36.475
I'm sorry
for slapping you.

06:36.509 --> 06:39.311
I kind of lost it.

06:39.345 --> 06:41.346
And it's not an excuse.

06:41.381 --> 06:43.415
Okay, that's twice you've said
you're sorry,

06:43.449 --> 06:46.618
which is, like, twice more than
I have ever heard you say it.

06:46.653 --> 06:48.420
I know.

06:48.454 --> 06:50.656
It's kind of a...

06:50.690 --> 06:53.425
"new leaf" thing with me.

06:53.459 --> 06:56.361
Oh, and Luke was kind of a...

06:56.396 --> 06:58.730
"payback" thing for me.

07:07.473 --> 07:10.442
We were one second
from coming over.

07:10.476 --> 07:13.312
We assume you have
something planned.

07:13.346 --> 07:14.613
To get even.

07:14.647 --> 07:17.349
Uh, like, say....

07:17.383 --> 07:19.418
a lying game?

07:19.452 --> 07:21.520
Well, if ever there was
a reason to start up again...

07:21.554 --> 07:23.322
Forget it, Mads,
she'll never go for it.

07:23.356 --> 07:24.690
Besides, we've got
more important things to do,

07:24.724 --> 07:26.358
like shopping.

07:26.392 --> 07:29.561
Oh. Uh, I'm gonna meet
you guys later, okay?

07:29.596 --> 07:32.331
Yeah.
Okay.

07:32.365 --> 07:34.266
(school bell rings)

07:36.336 --> 07:38.437
(sighs) Nothing, not one word
from Sutton.

07:38.471 --> 07:41.206
I tried video chat,
but she's never online.

07:41.241 --> 07:44.610
In the meantime, do you know
what the "lying games" are?

07:44.644 --> 07:47.446
I thought they were done
with those.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.348
They were big a few
years back-- it was...

07:49.382 --> 07:51.450
something Sutton
and her friends used to do.

07:51.484 --> 07:54.219
It was, like, um...
pranks and practical jokes.

07:54.254 --> 07:55.621
They would video, upload.

07:55.655 --> 07:59.491
Well, that's why Laurel thinks
the laptop was stolen.

08:00.593 --> 08:04.196
I'm desperate.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.398
First chance I get,
I'll go to my brother's computer

08:06.432 --> 08:09.268
at the station, and I'll look
for hospital records,

08:09.302 --> 08:11.637
police reports-- I'll see
if anything turns up there.

08:11.671 --> 08:14.539
Okay. Meanwhile, I have to deal
with this father-daughter dance.

08:14.574 --> 08:16.541
I have never ballroom-
danced in my entire life.

08:16.576 --> 08:18.477
The second I step
on that dance floor,

08:18.511 --> 08:20.479
people are gonna
just know I'm a fake.

08:20.513 --> 08:23.448
Well, I might actually be able
to help you with that one.

08:23.483 --> 08:24.483
Just meet me

08:24.517 --> 08:25.651
at 7:00 tonight

08:25.685 --> 08:27.252
at the Chelsea Creek
Country Club.

08:27.287 --> 08:28.387
It'll be on her nav system.

08:28.421 --> 08:29.488
Don't be late.

08:37.292 --> 08:38.491
Hey.

08:39.128 --> 08:42.030
Oh, this one.

08:43.232 --> 08:46.201
Hear you're standing
me up for the dance.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.203
That's okay, though.
I'm, I'm okay.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.004
(sighs):
I'm... fine.

08:50.039 --> 08:51.106
I'll be all right.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.907
(mock crying):
I can handle it.

08:52.942 --> 08:55.844
(laughs) It's... it's nothing
personal, Daddy.

08:55.878 --> 08:57.212
It's just...

08:57.246 --> 09:01.082
It's always been your night
with Sutton, and...

09:02.785 --> 09:05.987
This is... coming
from Mom, isn't it?

09:06.021 --> 09:07.989
Don't be so smart.

09:08.023 --> 09:09.991
That's right,
you <i>are</i> smart.

09:10.025 --> 09:11.192
Mm-hmm.

09:11.227 --> 09:13.061
(sighs)

09:13.095 --> 09:15.930
We just, we want you
to always remember...

09:15.965 --> 09:18.166
"We love you equally."

09:18.200 --> 09:21.069
Right. How many times
have we said that?

09:21.103 --> 09:23.004
It's cool.

09:23.038 --> 09:26.241
So the part about you
being the easy one

09:26.275 --> 09:28.977
and all that...?
Get it, too.

09:30.079 --> 09:32.247
I want you to be
there Sunday, honey.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.016
I need you there.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.885
Please?

09:40.055 --> 09:42.824
Okay. Sure, Dad.

09:42.858 --> 09:44.959
If it means that much.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.845
You work here?

10:03.879 --> 10:05.146
My brother called in a favor.

10:05.181 --> 10:07.882
After juvie, I had to get
on the straight-and-narrow.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.984
Job, curfew, haircuts.

10:10.019 --> 10:13.855
Ballroom's just through the
garden, then to the right.

10:13.889 --> 10:16.024
I get off in,
like, five minutes.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.963
(groans softly)

10:25.201 --> 10:26.901
MAN:
Hi, Sutton.

10:26.936 --> 10:29.938
Mr. and Mrs....

10:32.308 --> 10:33.908
...you.

10:33.943 --> 10:35.109
(sighs): Ah...

10:47.022 --> 10:49.858
So, do you know anything?

10:49.892 --> 10:52.126
Um... does the
chicken dance count?

10:54.196 --> 10:56.231
For right now,
just, um...

10:56.265 --> 10:59.267
don't even think about
the technical stuff, okay?

10:59.301 --> 11:02.770
Just try to...
feel the music.

11:02.805 --> 11:03.805
All right?

11:03.839 --> 11:05.106
Okay.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.107
Okay.

11:06.141 --> 11:08.009
Good.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.043
Here?

11:09.078 --> 11:10.044
Yeah.

11:10.079 --> 11:11.880
That's good.
Okay.

11:11.914 --> 11:13.948
Let go.
It's all right.

11:13.983 --> 11:15.016
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.084
Other foot.
(clears throat)

11:16.118 --> 11:17.185
Okay.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.253
Go.

11:18.287 --> 11:19.787
You're doing
all right. No.

11:19.822 --> 11:21.122
Keep looking at me.

11:21.156 --> 11:24.859
Okay, we'll go side.

11:24.894 --> 11:25.994
Side. To the side.

11:26.028 --> 11:27.028
Sorry.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.163
Just...
(sighs)

11:29.198 --> 11:31.232
You're doing
all right.

11:31.267 --> 11:32.967
No, keep
looking at me.

11:33.002 --> 11:35.003
You want to trust your partner
when you do this.

11:35.037 --> 11:36.237
That's the key.

11:36.272 --> 11:37.906
Now, let me lead.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.807
Side.

11:39.842 --> 11:41.175
Well, let your father
lead, you know.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.210
Back.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.978
To the side.
Just... (sighs)

11:44.013 --> 11:45.213
And then you
go through.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.247
Go through what?

11:46.282 --> 11:47.982
You-you--
it's a turn.

11:48.017 --> 11:49.984
(both sigh)

11:50.019 --> 11:51.920
All right, look.
Hey, come on.

11:51.954 --> 11:53.922
You have to learn this dance.
If somebody figures out that

11:53.956 --> 11:55.189
you're not who
you say you are,

11:55.224 --> 11:58.860
you're going back to
Vegas, and that's it.

12:00.863 --> 12:02.030
(sighs)

12:02.064 --> 12:04.999
So I just... trust him?

12:05.034 --> 12:07.802
Trust me.

12:07.836 --> 12:09.170
Okay, here.

12:12.241 --> 12:13.942
Look at me.

12:15.945 --> 12:17.278
Okay, ready?

12:22.017 --> 12:23.151
That's good.

12:29.091 --> 12:31.092
To the side.

12:34.997 --> 12:36.197
(gasps)

12:50.245 --> 12:52.847
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

12:52.881 --> 12:54.148
Oh.

12:54.183 --> 12:56.150
Sutton taught me.

13:21.419 --> 13:22.386
(music stops)

13:22.420 --> 13:23.620
No, no, no, no.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.079
You're not feeling
the music.

13:26.113 --> 13:28.114
You got to feel
the music. Again.

13:28.148 --> 13:29.982
Only this time, just Mads.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.919
Adagio, please.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.864
♪ ♪

14:07.688 --> 14:09.689
♪ ♪

14:24.905 --> 14:26.806
(applause)

14:26.840 --> 14:28.074
That's all for today.

14:28.108 --> 14:30.076
Char, if I could have a word
with you, please.

14:38.152 --> 14:40.720
Worried about Char.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.821
Why?

14:41.855 --> 14:42.989
Well, he's riding her
really hard,

14:43.023 --> 14:44.924
and you know how she gets.

14:44.958 --> 14:47.026
We'll get her
through it.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.095
Yeah, sure we will.

14:49.129 --> 14:51.798
There she is.

14:51.832 --> 14:53.099
How's my goddaughter?

14:53.133 --> 14:56.736
Wow. Paris agreed with you.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.904
Listen, I'm gonna take Mads

14:57.938 --> 14:59.839
to the club for dinner;
you want to join us?

14:59.873 --> 15:03.075
Oh, actually, we were planning
to go dress shopping

15:03.110 --> 15:04.977
for the father-daughter dance.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.914
You need some cash.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.015
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.852
It's probably
a better investment

15:12.886 --> 15:14.987
than your brother's
crazy video game venture.

15:15.022 --> 15:17.023
Has Mads told you?

15:17.057 --> 15:19.025
He hasn't been back
since he left for L.A.

15:19.059 --> 15:20.026
You haven't heard

15:20.060 --> 15:21.060
from him, have you?

15:21.094 --> 15:23.663
Couple of calls...

15:23.697 --> 15:25.698
here and there.

15:25.732 --> 15:28.968
I know it's hard to understand
what I'm doing, but...

15:29.002 --> 15:31.671
it's important that Thayer
understands how cold

15:31.705 --> 15:33.940
it can be out there--
away from home,

15:33.974 --> 15:35.641
no college degree.

15:35.676 --> 15:36.876
But you understand that,
don't you, Sutton?

15:36.910 --> 15:38.711
Yeah.

15:38.745 --> 15:40.012
(chuckles)
Yeah.

15:41.682 --> 15:43.649
Okay, well,
have fun shopping.

15:43.684 --> 15:45.952
Don't be home too late.
Mm-hmm.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.654
What was that?

15:48.689 --> 15:50.723
I thought you were
on Thayer's side.

15:50.757 --> 15:52.024
Sorry. I-I just...

15:52.059 --> 15:54.060
trying to keep the peace.

15:54.094 --> 15:56.095
CHAR: You've never been
able to do that.

15:57.731 --> 15:59.999
So, wh... what
did Eduardo want?

16:00.033 --> 16:03.769
Uh... I got cut
from the recital.

16:03.804 --> 16:06.005
You mean no solo?

16:06.039 --> 16:08.074
I mean no nothing. I'm out.

16:08.108 --> 16:11.844
Hey, sometimes you're born to do
something, sometimes you're not.

16:11.879 --> 16:13.613
Anyway, who wants
to go shopping?

16:13.647 --> 16:15.648
- You're driving, right, Sutton?
- Yeah.

16:15.682 --> 16:18.651
Let's go.

16:19.786 --> 16:21.587
Denial.

16:21.622 --> 16:23.789
(sighs)
Yeah, just like always.

16:23.824 --> 16:25.758
We should get her
to talk about it.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.994
(laughs)
Yeah, like that'll ever work.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.065
(siren wailing outside)

16:37.905 --> 16:40.973
You might want to ask my
permission before using my computer.

16:42.976 --> 16:44.043
Ah, Los Angeles.

16:44.077 --> 16:45.811
What's in L.A., buddy?

16:45.846 --> 16:47.647
Uh, I'm just
messing around.

16:47.681 --> 16:49.982
You know, trying to see what
celebs are back in rehab.

16:50.017 --> 16:52.885
- Cops know everything first, so...
- Well, this one is wondering

16:52.920 --> 16:54.720
why you're not
at work right now.

16:54.755 --> 16:56.689
(phone beeping)
Well, they cut my hours.

16:56.723 --> 16:58.691
(chuckles)
Really? Let me guess.

16:58.725 --> 17:00.927
Wouldn't cut your
hair, would you?

17:00.961 --> 17:03.629
Uh, no. I told them I couldn't.

17:03.664 --> 17:05.731
It's against our heritage.

17:05.766 --> 17:08.034
Yeah, I'm sure they loved
that one, didn't they?

17:08.068 --> 17:09.702
C-Come on.

17:09.736 --> 17:11.671
Oh, the...
the Mercer girl <i>again?</i>

17:11.704 --> 17:13.772
It's none of your business.
Actually,

17:13.807 --> 17:14.874
it is my business,

17:14.907 --> 17:16.576
as your court-appointed
watch dog

17:16.609 --> 17:17.977
to keep you out of trouble.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.912
And I'm telling you,
Sutton Mercer

17:19.946 --> 17:21.047
is nothing but.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.049
All those games
she plays,

17:23.083 --> 17:26.819
their friends, and now
that break-in in her home.

17:26.853 --> 17:29.689
There's something else
going on there, man.

17:29.723 --> 17:31.824
I'm sure of it.

17:33.827 --> 17:35.661
See you at home.

17:35.696 --> 17:36.929
Yeah.

17:47.841 --> 17:50.042
Think this'll work.

17:51.678 --> 17:53.646
Looks interesting.
Who's it from?

17:53.680 --> 17:55.615
No one.

17:55.649 --> 17:56.849
No one?

17:56.883 --> 17:59.652
(phone rings)

17:59.686 --> 18:00.953
Thayer!

18:02.623 --> 18:03.990
Hey, big brother.

18:04.024 --> 18:05.825
How's L.A.?

18:05.859 --> 18:07.660
Sunny, hot...

18:07.694 --> 18:09.829
but nowhere near Phoenix hot.

18:09.863 --> 18:11.831
I saw you called;
what's up?

18:11.865 --> 18:13.666
Oh, um, just wanted
you to know,

18:13.700 --> 18:14.867
I'm sending
you some cash.

18:14.901 --> 18:16.636
Yeah, look, if it's from Dad...

18:16.670 --> 18:17.803
or you...

18:17.838 --> 18:19.739
Doesn't matter where I got it.

18:19.773 --> 18:21.574
Just take it.
Dad's convinced

18:21.608 --> 18:22.842
when you're broke
enough, you'll come home.

18:22.876 --> 18:25.645
So, how is your
project going?

18:25.679 --> 18:27.780
Oh, a little slow.
I've had some distractions.

18:27.814 --> 18:30.750
There's a lot of game aps
out there, lots of competition.

18:30.784 --> 18:33.653
Well, hey, Sutton's
here, home from Paris.

18:33.687 --> 18:34.854
Say hi.

18:36.089 --> 18:37.957
Hi!

18:37.991 --> 18:39.825
Hey, Sutton.

18:39.860 --> 18:41.661
How was France?

18:41.695 --> 18:43.929
Good. How's L.A.?

18:43.964 --> 18:45.731
Good.

18:47.067 --> 18:50.069
Oh, God, could this
be any more boring?

18:50.103 --> 18:52.605
Miss you, Thayer,
and love ya.

18:52.639 --> 18:53.839
Watch for that cash.

18:53.874 --> 18:55.074
Okay.

18:56.777 --> 18:59.578
Uh-oh. We left Char
with your mother.

18:59.613 --> 19:01.647
I'm okay, Mrs. M., really.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.749
I figure I just won't tell her.

19:03.784 --> 19:06.786
Hey, maybe she won't even ask.
Char,

19:06.820 --> 19:08.654
I've known your mom a long time.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.589
She's going to ask.

19:10.624 --> 19:12.792
But Mom's put this whole chunk
of herself into my dancing.

19:12.826 --> 19:14.894
As much as I wish
she would get a life,

19:14.928 --> 19:16.929
I just can't do this
to her right now.

19:16.963 --> 19:18.564
I need to lie.

19:18.598 --> 19:20.733
Right, guys?

19:20.767 --> 19:22.902
Yeah. Sort of, like, what
other choice do you have?

19:23.937 --> 19:25.538
Right?

19:25.572 --> 19:27.673
Yeah.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.843
I... Well,
I guess in this case...

19:30.877 --> 19:32.978
Mom?
I...

19:33.013 --> 19:36.682
think if it was my kid I would
want her to tell me the truth.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.851
MADS: Yeah, it'd be nice
if parents did, too.

19:38.885 --> 19:40.753
CHAR: My dad doesn't
tell me everything;

19:40.787 --> 19:41.854
or sometimes anything.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.723
What do you think
I should do, Sutton?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.894
I think you should...

19:48.929 --> 19:51.764
tell her the truth.

19:51.798 --> 19:55.735
I mean, the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

19:55.769 --> 19:58.671
Well, good.
Problem solved.

19:58.705 --> 20:01.006
And, girls,
love the dresses.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.742
(Char sighs)

20:02.776 --> 20:06.645
Well, guess it's time
to face the music.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.848
I'd better go get changed.

20:08.882 --> 20:11.684
Me, too.

20:11.718 --> 20:13.786
Oh, hey, Mads, wait,
you... have a tag

20:13.820 --> 20:15.621
on your dress.

20:15.655 --> 20:17.757
Um, hello? BWR.

20:18.925 --> 20:20.760
Buy Wear Return.

20:20.794 --> 20:22.628
Oh. (laughs)

20:22.662 --> 20:23.796
Right, right.

20:23.830 --> 20:26.799
And then SMT--
Send Money to Thayer?

20:26.833 --> 20:28.667
Exactly.

20:28.702 --> 20:31.604
Come on.
Char needs us.

20:31.638 --> 20:33.939
PHYLLIS:
<i>...just because.</i>

20:33.974 --> 20:36.041
And I'm assuming
you won a plum roll

20:36.076 --> 20:39.645
in the fall recital-- he
announced today, right?

20:39.679 --> 20:40.846
Sort of.

20:40.881 --> 20:42.748
Sweetie, he did
or he didn't?

20:44.084 --> 20:47.052
Okay, hey, not
everyone gets a solo.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.689
Actually...

20:52.025 --> 20:53.726
...I was cut from recital.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.795
The whole thing.

20:55.829 --> 20:57.630
I didn't make it.

20:57.664 --> 21:00.733
You know, I'm gonna go
give that studio a call.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.034
No.

21:02.936 --> 21:03.936
Mother,

21:03.970 --> 21:05.671
I really wish you wouldn't.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.776
I'm just not a natural, okay?
It doesn't come easily.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.913
It's not supposed to;
it takes hard work.

21:13.947 --> 21:15.848
Right, Mads?
And...

21:15.882 --> 21:18.684
Sutton, reaching your level in
tennis didn't happen overnight.

21:18.718 --> 21:19.785
No, but...

21:19.820 --> 21:21.821
Of course
it didn't.

21:23.790 --> 21:25.558
(exhales)
You know...

21:25.592 --> 21:26.959
sometimes I wish...

21:26.993 --> 21:28.761
Go on.

21:29.896 --> 21:31.831
You wish I was like one of them.

21:33.033 --> 21:34.834
That's just...

21:34.868 --> 21:35.968
What's that, Sutton?

21:36.002 --> 21:37.036
She was just
about to say

21:37.070 --> 21:38.904
it's time for us
to go. Right?

21:38.939 --> 21:41.841
No, I don't think that's
what she was going to say.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.876
No, I-I'm sorry, I...

21:43.910 --> 21:45.911
You know what?
Char is my friend,

21:45.946 --> 21:47.046
and she's
not a quitter.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.714
She's hurting.

21:48.748 --> 21:51.650
You are so lucky to
have someone like her.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.919
- She deserves much...
- You know, I think I'm done here.

21:55.822 --> 21:56.789
Come inside, Char.

22:08.668 --> 22:09.969
You have lost
your mind.

22:10.003 --> 22:12.571
I know. I know.
I-I-I'm usually...

22:12.606 --> 22:14.006
You usually
duck and run.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.975
God, Sutton,
who are you?

22:16.009 --> 22:18.711
I... I'm...

22:18.745 --> 22:22.815
Whatever that was,
don't... don't ever stop,

22:22.849 --> 22:25.584
'cause... (sighs)

22:26.786 --> 22:29.688
That was awesome.
Oh.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.757
Yeah.

22:36.241 --> 22:38.676
Hey. I'm just playing
a quick round with Alec...

22:38.809 --> 22:39.909
about tonight...

22:39.944 --> 22:41.011
I know.

22:41.045 --> 22:43.780
From here, 8:00.

22:45.883 --> 22:47.884
Hi.

22:47.918 --> 22:50.587
Looks like fun.
I'd ask you to lend a hand...

22:50.621 --> 22:51.888
Can I?

22:53.057 --> 22:56.660
Stir this while
I butter the pan.

22:57.962 --> 23:01.564
So... Char's
mom called.

23:01.599 --> 23:02.932
About that--

23:02.967 --> 23:04.901
I'm sorry.

23:04.935 --> 23:09.005
Um... I don't really know
what got into me.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.875
Char's my friend, and the way
that her mom was talking to her,

23:11.909 --> 23:13.777
it just kind of came out.

23:13.811 --> 23:15.745
Well, you may have gone
a little overboard,

23:15.780 --> 23:17.781
but she probably
deserved it.

23:17.815 --> 23:19.849
Phyllis has always been
a little bit of a pain,

23:19.884 --> 23:22.018
even back in high school.

23:34.865 --> 23:37.067
(sighs) Sneak attack.

23:38.803 --> 23:40.804
Won't happen again.

23:54.785 --> 23:56.753
Good.

23:57.822 --> 23:59.956
Nice.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.658
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
What?

24:01.692 --> 24:03.560
I...

24:03.594 --> 24:04.861
I... (sighs)

24:04.895 --> 24:06.863
It's just, it's
been three days

24:06.897 --> 24:08.865
and... and three
nights now.

24:08.899 --> 24:09.966
I realize that.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.601
I told you-- I-I checked

24:11.635 --> 24:13.603
with the hospitals,
police reports.

24:13.637 --> 24:15.805
There was nothing.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.807
Los Angeles is a huge place.

24:17.842 --> 24:18.975
Emma, I know that.

24:19.009 --> 24:20.677
Look, I'm...
I'm worried here, too.

24:20.711 --> 24:22.612
Okay, but right now,
we have to do

24:22.646 --> 24:23.780
what she
asked us to do.

24:23.814 --> 24:25.582
Great, but tell
me this one--

24:25.616 --> 24:26.983
how am I supposed to
keep being Sutton

24:27.017 --> 24:28.885
when I know
nothing about her?

24:28.919 --> 24:31.855
I keep thinking that I'm doing
things that Sutton would do,

24:31.889 --> 24:33.957
and then I just end
up messing it up.

24:33.991 --> 24:36.626
God, those parents.

24:36.660 --> 24:41.598
A mother like that,
and a father-- a... a dad.

24:41.632 --> 24:45.034
And friends-- those girls
are the best friends.

24:45.069 --> 24:47.804
It's everything
that I've ever wanted,

24:47.838 --> 24:50.673
except it's not mine; it's hers,

24:50.708 --> 24:55.044
and I'm just here...
I'm borrowing it.

24:55.079 --> 24:56.980
(music playing)

24:57.014 --> 25:00.884
If Emma's done, I believe Sutton
has to get ready for the dance.

25:04.789 --> 25:06.790
All right?
Yes. Sorry.

25:06.824 --> 25:08.992
Try a couple
of pirouettes.

25:09.026 --> 25:11.628
Kind of hard
in this terrain.

25:11.662 --> 25:12.629
Do a turn.

25:12.663 --> 25:13.897
Go through it.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.832
There you go.

25:19.904 --> 25:22.906
Hold still-- I can't
do this with you squirming.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.841
So your mom gets drunk at lunch,

25:24.875 --> 25:26.910
and your dad has to
stay home with her.

25:26.944 --> 25:28.845
She so did this on purpose.

25:28.879 --> 25:30.980
CHAR:
I'm okay with it. Really, guys.

25:31.015 --> 25:33.016
Now, sit still--
this part's critical.

25:33.050 --> 25:35.919
Come with us.
My dad'll dance with you.

25:35.953 --> 25:38.755
Well... I did bring my dress.

25:38.789 --> 25:40.857
(laughs)
Nnn, surprise, surprise.

25:40.891 --> 25:43.893
(doorbell rings)
Go get changed; I'll finish this.

25:43.928 --> 25:46.029
Hi.
Hey.

25:46.063 --> 25:48.998
Like always, they've been up
in that bedroom all afternoon.

25:49.033 --> 25:51.868
Well, I got to admit, I'm kind
of looking forward to it myself.

25:51.902 --> 25:53.002
TED:
Looking forward to it?

25:53.037 --> 25:55.672
Highlight of your year--
who you kidding?

25:55.706 --> 25:58.641
Hey, Ted. Please find out what
is taking them so long, hmm?

25:58.676 --> 26:00.710
I'm gonna find my phone;
we're gonna go.

26:00.744 --> 26:01.811
All right.

26:01.846 --> 26:03.746
Any news from Thayer?

26:03.781 --> 26:04.848
I'm sure he's all right.

26:04.882 --> 26:06.649
He'll be home in no time.

26:06.684 --> 26:08.518
That's got to be hard.

26:11.522 --> 26:12.789
Yeah.

26:12.823 --> 26:14.824
Do what we can, right?

26:28.639 --> 26:30.573
Thank you.
Yeah.

26:31.842 --> 26:33.776
The guy so gives me
the creeps.

26:33.811 --> 26:35.845
Here, touch--
actual goose bumps.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.947
ALEC: Hold up.
Let's get a picture.

26:37.982 --> 26:39.716
Oh.
Who's got a camera?

26:39.750 --> 26:41.985
Here, use mine.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.754
Would you be so kind?
Uh, yeah.

26:44.788 --> 26:45.822
Gather round, girls.

26:45.856 --> 26:48.825
Smile. Smile.

26:48.859 --> 26:49.926
(shutter clicks)

26:49.960 --> 26:51.861
Yeah, there we go.

26:51.896 --> 26:53.696
All right.
Oh, wait, what is that?

26:53.731 --> 26:55.565
What is that that I'm hearing?

26:55.599 --> 26:58.001
Is that music?

26:58.035 --> 27:00.570
Warm up the dancing shoes.

27:00.604 --> 27:01.838
Your dad is so funny.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.606
Some of us see it

27:03.641 --> 27:04.674
as a little nerdy.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.476
Bordering
on buffoonish.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.578
Well, whatever it is,
he sure loves his family.

27:08.612 --> 27:10.580
It makes you so lucky.

27:10.614 --> 27:12.548
Ms. Mercer?

27:17.922 --> 27:19.822
There's still no word?

27:19.857 --> 27:22.759
No. I had this fantasy

27:22.793 --> 27:24.761
that she would walk in
right before we left.

27:24.795 --> 27:26.829
You know, even if they
do send me back to Vegas,

27:26.864 --> 27:28.631
at least it'd save me

27:28.666 --> 27:30.833
from making an ass out of myself
on the dance floor.

27:30.868 --> 27:33.569
You're gonna do fine, okay?

27:33.604 --> 27:35.772
And you look great.

27:35.806 --> 27:37.874
Just like Sutton.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.577
No. Just like you.

27:46.717 --> 27:49.652
I mean, who would really
care if I don't dance?

27:49.687 --> 27:51.554
Seriously, would
anyone even notice?

27:51.588 --> 27:54.557
CHAR: Well, probably
just about everyone.

27:54.591 --> 27:57.794
Yeah, you'd need
a supersized excuse.

27:57.828 --> 28:00.830
Actually, my knee's
feeling really tweaked.

28:00.864 --> 28:02.932
Please, that
one again?

28:02.967 --> 28:07.537
Let's get something
to drink, Mads.

28:07.571 --> 28:09.839
This thing is at the top of
my lame list.

28:09.873 --> 28:15.712
Huh? Three-time
all-pro, like, every single

28:15.746 --> 28:16.913
record is his?

28:16.947 --> 28:19.716
Whoa. I remember
Dad used to kid you

28:19.750 --> 28:21.851
about knowing nothing
about football.

28:21.885 --> 28:27.523
Oh. I-I mean, Googling.

28:27.558 --> 28:28.858
Sutton and her laptop...

28:28.892 --> 28:30.827
like Freddie Krueger
and his claw.

28:30.861 --> 28:34.964
(chuckles) Ooh, look,
some of my friends.

28:38.569 --> 28:39.969
I tell you, though,
it's been a big relief.

28:40.004 --> 28:41.804
There's a lot less
tension around the house.

28:41.839 --> 28:43.740
She's still keeping
secrets, though, right?

28:43.774 --> 28:45.975
Yeah. I doubt that
will ever change.

28:46.010 --> 28:49.612
But we have kept a few of
our own, haven't we?

28:49.646 --> 28:51.647
Just the one.

29:04.595 --> 29:06.629
(phone ringing)

29:18.909 --> 29:20.877
Hello?

29:20.911 --> 29:23.746
TRAVIS:
Hey, Emma, finally answered.

29:23.781 --> 29:25.681
Beginning to think
you were avoiding me.

29:25.716 --> 29:27.917
I'm sorry, no.
I-I just picked up.

29:27.951 --> 29:29.752
Who is this?

29:29.787 --> 29:32.922
(phone clicks, dial tone droning)
Hello?

29:41.435 --> 29:42.635
And now the highlight
of our evening

29:43.401 --> 29:45.502
the traditional spotlight dance.

30:07.258 --> 30:09.058
Come on. I feel
like I'm dancing

30:09.093 --> 30:10.126
with a couple
of two-by-fours.

30:10.161 --> 30:13.296
Just trying to remember.

30:13.330 --> 30:15.465
Paris wasn't
that long ago.

30:15.499 --> 30:19.068
What a blast we had at that
dance hall dancing all night.

30:19.103 --> 30:21.237
There we go. Okay.

30:21.272 --> 30:24.174
At least you've given up
trying to lead.

30:24.208 --> 30:25.542
(chuckles)

30:27.478 --> 30:29.312
Ah...

30:39.457 --> 30:41.424
They look so good
out there.

30:44.361 --> 30:47.263
What?

30:47.298 --> 30:52.168
Nothing. It's just that
you're actually talking to me.

30:52.203 --> 30:55.104
It's not like you're
this total cretin.

30:55.139 --> 30:57.540
Uh, thanks?

30:57.575 --> 31:00.143
She's different since
she got back from Paris.

31:00.177 --> 31:02.445
She sure is.

31:15.526 --> 31:17.494
(cheers and applause)

31:17.528 --> 31:20.163
It's okay, it's okay.

31:20.197 --> 31:22.532
Hey, you're doing
great. Ready?

31:22.566 --> 31:23.533
Thank you, sweetheart.

31:33.277 --> 31:35.078
I love you, honey.

31:35.112 --> 31:37.447
I love you, too... Dad.

31:41.452 --> 31:44.053
(song ends, crowd cheers)

31:44.088 --> 31:45.522
(chuckles)

31:48.425 --> 31:51.294
Substitute daughter
reporting for duty.

31:54.365 --> 31:56.232
(whispers): Where's Laurel?

31:59.436 --> 32:02.171
Char just butted in,
but you're next.

32:02.206 --> 32:04.140
Dad really wants
to dance with you.

32:04.174 --> 32:06.075
Not to worry.

32:06.110 --> 32:08.511
I'm well-versed in
how to wait my turn.

32:12.182 --> 32:15.184
Did you really have
to have another drink?

32:19.323 --> 32:21.324
Your tag is out.

32:25.396 --> 32:27.096
Let me guess.

32:27.131 --> 32:31.134
You're gonna return
the dress anyways.

32:31.168 --> 32:35.138
And you sent the money
I gave you to Thayer.

32:35.172 --> 32:38.107
Dad...
Hmm?

32:38.142 --> 32:41.210
can't you understand that
he's living his dream in L.A.?

32:41.245 --> 32:42.512
It's what he's always wanted?

32:42.546 --> 32:45.281
And that the whole idea of him
getting some law degree,

32:45.316 --> 32:48.117
that was your dream,
not his?

32:48.152 --> 32:49.385
Mads, let me explain

32:49.420 --> 32:52.088
to you something
about pipe dreams.

32:52.122 --> 32:53.456
His is a pipe dream,

32:53.490 --> 32:56.492
and they have a nasty habit
of not turning out at all.

32:56.527 --> 33:00.263
Maybe you should try
and explain that to him

33:00.297 --> 33:03.299
since, apparently, you're
the only one he'll listen to.

33:03.334 --> 33:05.134
No.

33:05.169 --> 33:07.370
I'm not going to do that.

33:10.074 --> 33:12.208
I'm not.

33:12.242 --> 33:14.077
(sighs)

33:33.063 --> 33:35.331
Hey. Could you
call me a cab?

33:39.103 --> 33:42.438
I'm just trying
to understand, okay?

33:42.473 --> 33:45.408
I'm not scared
of you anymore.

33:45.442 --> 33:47.510
Do you think I want
you afraid of me?

33:47.544 --> 33:51.080
I think you count on it.

33:52.483 --> 33:55.251
How can you not realize
how much I love you?

33:55.285 --> 33:57.086
Both my children.

33:57.121 --> 33:59.022
Then why can't you
leave us alone?

33:59.056 --> 34:01.324
Because I love you.

34:01.358 --> 34:04.193
I need my son back.
You understand that?

34:04.228 --> 34:06.129
Well, maybe he doesn't need you.

34:06.163 --> 34:09.032
And he certainly doesn't need
you telling him what to do.

34:09.065 --> 34:12.301
Dad, Thayer was drowning here.

34:12.335 --> 34:15.071
He had to leave. Have him come
back and tell that to me!

34:15.105 --> 34:16.472
So you can just yell
at him some more?

34:16.507 --> 34:18.306
So you can humiliate him
like you always do?

34:18.342 --> 34:20.275
Is everything okay?

34:20.310 --> 34:24.013
We're fine. You know, God,
haven't <i>you</i> done enough?

34:24.047 --> 34:26.081
Uh... I don't...

34:26.116 --> 34:28.117
Listen, I know you talk to
Thayer all the time, okay?

34:28.152 --> 34:29.318
You...

34:29.353 --> 34:31.054
It was probably
your idea that he

34:31.088 --> 34:32.422
go to Los Angeles,
am I wrong?

34:32.456 --> 34:33.382
Dad.

34:33.384 --> 34:34.524
It was probably you
that gave him the idea

34:34.525 --> 34:35.701
to go there, you told
him, didn't you?

34:35.726 --> 34:36.525
I'm sorry, I...

34:36.527 --> 34:38.226
- Didn't you? Answer me!
- No.

34:38.262 --> 34:40.329
Is that right? Answer me!
What are you doing?

34:40.364 --> 34:41.330
TED:
Hey! Whoa.

34:41.364 --> 34:43.433
Whoa. Calm down, Alec...

34:44.435 --> 34:46.302
TED:
Calm down, both of you.

34:46.335 --> 34:50.206
TED: Hey. Hey!
Maybe we should call security.

34:51.442 --> 34:54.243
(garbled police radio
transmission)

35:05.022 --> 35:06.322
Looks like I assaulted
the right D.A.

35:06.356 --> 35:08.424
He's not going
to press charges.

35:08.459 --> 35:10.093
Oh...

35:12.396 --> 35:14.464
My brother and Mads'
father go way back.

35:14.498 --> 35:17.133
I... you didn't
have to defend me.

35:18.268 --> 35:20.169
I-I kind of lost it.

35:20.204 --> 35:22.071
That happens to me sometimes.

35:22.106 --> 35:25.441
It's just... another thing
that you wouldn't know.

35:29.246 --> 35:30.413
What?

35:32.516 --> 35:35.218
I'm so done with this.

35:42.059 --> 35:44.293
Save it, Sutton.
No charges were filed.

35:44.328 --> 35:46.295
Yeah, I know, I know.
That's not what this is about.

35:46.330 --> 35:49.098
Well, I was just
about to leave,

35:49.133 --> 35:51.300
to go thank Alec Rybak,
so whatever it is...

35:51.335 --> 35:53.102
What is it that you want?
No, there's something

35:53.137 --> 35:55.037
that you need to know,
and it cannot wait.

35:55.072 --> 35:56.038
(sighs)

35:56.073 --> 35:57.140
Fine.

36:00.277 --> 36:02.178
I'm not who I say I am.

36:02.212 --> 36:04.180
I'm not Sutton Mercer.

36:04.214 --> 36:06.249
My name is Emma Becker.
I am her twin sister,

36:06.283 --> 36:08.151
we were separated as babies,

36:08.185 --> 36:11.254
and you need to listen to me--
I think that she is in trouble.

36:11.288 --> 36:13.022
That's...

36:13.056 --> 36:14.991
that's actually a really
good one, you know?

36:15.025 --> 36:17.093
I mean, it's just another
one of your games, right?

36:17.127 --> 36:18.294
Same crap as last year.

36:18.328 --> 36:20.396
False alarms.
Fake calls to police.

36:20.430 --> 36:23.432
I mean, you guys set me up
like what-- five times already?

36:23.467 --> 36:25.101
Now I've really got to go.

36:25.135 --> 36:26.102
(cell phone rings)

36:26.136 --> 36:28.137
Wait.

36:29.339 --> 36:30.473
Yes?

36:30.507 --> 36:33.042
I'm sorry?

36:33.076 --> 36:35.111
You said "wait,"
so I'm waiting.

36:35.145 --> 36:38.147
Yeah, uh... well,
what I meant to say...

36:38.182 --> 36:42.118
was... you were right.

36:42.152 --> 36:44.220
It's... a lying game.

36:44.254 --> 36:46.255
Great.

36:50.360 --> 36:53.262
Let me guess:
He didn't believe you.

36:53.297 --> 36:56.132
Yeah. N-- I mean, no.
It doesn't matter. Look.

36:56.166 --> 36:58.201
It's her.

36:58.235 --> 37:00.303
It's Sutton.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.924
MADS: It's really important
to you, huh?

37:09.031 --> 37:10.966
That we all stay together.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.936
High school, college, forever.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.839
Isn't it to you?

37:16.873 --> 37:18.941
Yeah. Sure.

37:18.975 --> 37:22.144
You're not thinking of
taking off, too? Like Thayer?

37:22.178 --> 37:24.947
No.

37:24.981 --> 37:27.850
No, can't desert my girls.

37:27.884 --> 37:29.952
Better not.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.955
(cell phone buzzes)

37:32.989 --> 37:35.090
(sighs)
My dad.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.925
Pretty sure that's
who they had in mind

37:36.960 --> 37:38.260
when they invented.
the "ignore" button.

37:39.963 --> 37:41.864
Hey.
There you are.

37:41.898 --> 37:43.195
Hi.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.614
You get Mads and
Char home okay?

37:44.615 --> 37:47.301
Yeah.
No problem.

37:48.104 --> 37:50.038
Well, I just told your
mom about what happened.

37:50.073 --> 37:51.874
You're okay, though?

37:51.908 --> 37:53.108
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:53.143 --> 37:55.043
Just... tired.

37:55.078 --> 37:56.912
Good night, guys.

37:56.946 --> 38:00.949
Oh, honey, I found this
in your bedroom.

38:00.984 --> 38:02.951
Any idea whose this is?

38:02.986 --> 38:05.053
That's Char's.

38:05.088 --> 38:07.823
She... must've left it there.

38:07.857 --> 38:11.126
She loves my bedroom.
She'd move in if I let her.

38:12.896 --> 38:15.130
Well, it rang,
and I answered it,

38:15.165 --> 38:18.167
and the guy on the other end
asked for an "Emma."

38:18.201 --> 38:21.036
I don't know any Emmas.
Do you?

38:22.906 --> 38:25.073
Must be one of her
Facebook aliases.

38:25.108 --> 38:27.843
You know, she has
like three or four...

38:27.877 --> 38:30.012
I'll make sure she
gets it back. Thanks.

38:30.046 --> 38:33.115
Okay. Well, good night. Um...

38:33.149 --> 38:34.850
Thanks for a nice time, Dad.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.153
TED:
Night, hon.

38:42.158 --> 38:45.060
She's letting us back in.

38:45.094 --> 38:47.830
I don't think we
can question it.

39:00.043 --> 39:01.977
(sighs)

39:02.011 --> 39:03.078
Hey.

39:03.112 --> 39:04.079
(typing)

39:04.113 --> 39:05.814
(computer beeps)

39:05.849 --> 39:07.115
SUTTON:
Emma, there you are.

39:07.150 --> 39:09.818
I have never been so glad
to see someone.

39:09.853 --> 39:10.953
You have no idea.

39:10.987 --> 39:12.888
Sorry I didn't make it
to the cabin.

39:12.922 --> 39:14.122
How's it going there?

39:14.157 --> 39:16.825
A lot happens in a day
in the life

39:16.860 --> 39:18.927
of Sutton Mercer.
I mean, so far I

39:18.962 --> 39:24.833
caught Luke cheating with Nisha,
and I broke up with him, and...

39:24.868 --> 39:25.834
Yeah, and me.

39:25.869 --> 39:27.069
Wait a second...

39:27.103 --> 39:29.805
Yeah, you should have
told her about us.

39:29.839 --> 39:31.940
All right? And you should've
told me that you had a twin.

39:31.975 --> 39:34.009
And that you were
going to L.A.

39:34.043 --> 39:36.044
You know, you've had
Emma worried sick.

39:37.947 --> 39:39.014
What about you?

39:39.048 --> 39:41.850
More pissed than worried.

39:41.885 --> 39:44.820
Look, Sutton, I just need to
know what's happening there.

39:44.854 --> 39:47.055
You said something
about a meeting.

39:47.090 --> 39:48.857
Okay.

39:48.892 --> 39:51.093
The night before you came here,

39:51.127 --> 39:55.097
I found a profile page of a
woman who I think is our mother.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.866
So I arranged to meet with her

39:57.901 --> 40:00.068
at this pier in L.A.,
but she never showed up.

40:00.103 --> 40:04.106
Then someone stole my purse
with my keys, everything.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.941
Things are... weird, here.

40:05.975 --> 40:10.846
I just need a little bit
more time.

40:12.849 --> 40:14.116
Well, someone broke
into your house.

40:14.150 --> 40:15.951
My house?

40:15.985 --> 40:17.786
Yeah, your room.
And the only thing

40:17.820 --> 40:18.921
that they stole
is the laptop.

40:18.955 --> 40:20.889
Yeah, so we need to
know what's on it.

40:20.924 --> 40:23.825
God, absolutely everything
is on that!

40:23.860 --> 40:25.827
The search for our
biological parents.

40:25.862 --> 40:27.829
The fact that
I even have a twin.

40:27.864 --> 40:29.131
The trail that's
led me back to here.

40:29.165 --> 40:31.833
You guys need to
find that thing.

40:31.868 --> 40:33.902
We'll try.

40:33.937 --> 40:35.837
Okay.

40:35.872 --> 40:39.141
Look, I-I just need a few
more days, I promise.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.842
Think you can handle it?

40:40.877 --> 40:42.844
Yeah.
Okay.

40:42.879 --> 40:46.048
Well...

40:46.082 --> 40:47.049
good night, you two.

40:47.083 --> 40:49.885
(computer beeps)

40:53.890 --> 40:55.991
Why didn't you tell
them about me?

40:56.025 --> 40:57.926
How I'm helping
you in this?

40:57.961 --> 41:00.896
We've a bigger problem.

41:00.930 --> 41:03.832
My laptop was stolen.

41:05.902 --> 41:07.803
(sighs)

41:07.837 --> 41:09.838
Look, I told you, I don't know
what's wrong with Alec.

41:09.872 --> 41:11.974
I've never seen him
act like this before.

41:12.008 --> 41:15.744
Angry at Sutton? I mean, it
just, it doesn't make sense.

41:15.778 --> 41:17.746
I'll tell you the thing
that doesn't make sense

41:17.780 --> 41:19.815
is this valet. This kid--
you weren't there.

41:19.849 --> 41:21.049
The way he stepped in...

41:21.084 --> 41:24.052
I mean, it's like
he knew Sutton.

41:24.087 --> 41:26.888
He's seeing her!

41:27.890 --> 41:29.091
What did you say?

41:29.125 --> 41:31.927
It's just...

41:31.961 --> 41:33.762
TED:
Honey...

41:33.796 --> 41:35.831
Do you know something?

41:35.865 --> 41:37.899
His name's Ethan Whitehorse.

41:37.934 --> 41:40.035
I saw him watching you
guys dance at the club,

41:40.069 --> 41:41.103
and sneaking around
with Sutton at school.

41:41.137 --> 41:43.839
I mean...

41:43.873 --> 41:45.841
It's like he's her secret
boyfriend or something.

41:49.879 --> 41:50.979
Sutton?

41:54.083 --> 41:56.084
- I was just, um...
- He's just a friend.

41:56.119 --> 41:58.954
Um. He came over
to apologize.

41:58.988 --> 42:01.923
Yeah? So why didn't he
use the front door?

42:07.864 --> 42:09.965
(sighs)

42:09.990 --> 42:13.990
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

42:19.588 --> 42:21.200
You expecting someone else?

42:22.766 --> 42:23.966
What can I do for you Dan?

42:25.523 --> 42:28.796
I wanted to thank you for not
pressing charges against my brother.

42:28.821 --> 42:30.021
Ah, listen, he's just a kid

42:31.633 --> 42:32.833
We all make mistakes.

42:34.580 --> 42:35.780
Don't we?

42:38.346 --> 42:39.546
Suppose we do.

42:41.822 --> 42:43.660
Goodnight Dan.

42:45.515 --> 42:46.715
Goodnight.

43:11.982 --> 43:13.200
Where the hell have you been?

43:13.790 --> 43:15.830
You didn't tell me those
Mercer's had an alarm.

43:16.959 --> 43:18.834
But as promised,
Sutton Mercer's laptop.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.477
So, about those possession charges?

43:23.502 --> 43:24.953
Yeah, yeah,
you're off the hook.

43:27.047 --> 43:28.247
Okay.
