WEBVTT

00:09.000 --> 00:12.200
- All right, rockers, time
for a little freestyle jam sesh.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.333
Freddy, you ready
to pound those skins?

00:14.333 --> 00:15.933
- Locked and loaded.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.167
[plays drums]

00:17.167 --> 00:19.933
- Zack, Tomika,
you fools ready to shred?

00:19.933 --> 00:22.000
- Bring it.
- Let's do this.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.900
[both playing guitars]
- Oh.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.467
You both scare me,
and I dig it.

00:27.467 --> 00:30.100
Lawrence, you all
set to tickle those keys?

00:30.100 --> 00:32.367
- Oh, come on,
they get to pound and shred,

00:32.367 --> 00:34.500
and I have to tickle?

00:34.500 --> 00:36.033
- Fair point.

00:36.033 --> 00:39.133
Wail on those keys like they
just called your mama "stupid."

00:39.133 --> 00:41.200
- That woman does
the best she can

00:41.200 --> 00:43.467
with the tools
she was given.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.600
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, rock--

00:45.600 --> 00:48.033
- Summer, banging
on the tambo.

00:48.033 --> 00:51.167
[plays tambourine off-key]

00:54.567 --> 00:56.033
- Okay, Summer.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.200
- Double tamb!

00:57.200 --> 01:00.067
- Okay.
You can--

01:01.467 --> 01:05.067
[music ends, tambourines
continue playing off-key]

01:07.667 --> 01:09.067
- Sweet jam sesh.

01:09.067 --> 01:11.100
I think we're ready
to lay that track down.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.333
- [chuckles]
Summer, the tambourine

01:13.333 --> 01:15.367
is a subtle instrument.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.733
It makes more of an impact
when it makes less of an impact.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.167
You feel me?

01:20.167 --> 01:22.667
- I think. So you're saying
I should do less?

01:22.667 --> 01:25.067
- Well, if you say so.

01:25.067 --> 01:26.700
As a matter of fact,

01:26.700 --> 01:30.667
let's get you a brand-new,
slightly more quiet instrument.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.900
Bang these together,
hard as you want.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.733
Just feel the music.

01:34.733 --> 01:35.967
- But how will anybody--

01:35.967 --> 01:37.767
- Two, three, four!

01:37.767 --> 01:41.067
[band plays rock]

01:41.067 --> 01:43.733
- [coughing]

01:43.733 --> 01:47.667
- Yeah, there we go, people.
Now we're jamming.

01:47.667 --> 01:51.067
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

01:51.067 --> 01:53.433
* It all adds up
to one thing *

01:53.433 --> 01:55.167
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.500
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

01:57.500 --> 02:00.200
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

02:00.200 --> 02:03.167
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:03.167 --> 02:04.767
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

02:04.767 --> 02:06.500
*

02:06.500 --> 02:08.500
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

02:08.500 --> 02:10.967
* There's a answer
right in front of you *

02:10.967 --> 02:13.667
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:13.667 --> 02:15.433
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

02:15.433 --> 02:17.533
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

02:20.067 --> 02:23.167

02:29.600 --> 02:31.500
- [humming keyboard riff]

02:31.500 --> 02:33.300
- [humming guitar riff]

02:33.300 --> 02:36.533

- [off-key]
* Hi yi yi yi, ya yi yi yi!

02:44.800 --> 02:46.067
- No?

02:46.067 --> 02:48.267
Okay.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.267
[school bell rings]

02:50.267 --> 02:52.200
He's late, again.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.900
- I don't get it. How much time
does it take to not shower?

02:56.900 --> 03:00.267
- Here is today's bulletin,
Mr. Fi--Mr.--

03:00.267 --> 03:02.367
[scoffs]
Class, where is Mr. Finn?

03:02.367 --> 03:04.667
Is he tardy?
- Shh.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.067
- Principal Mullins,
I'm so glad you're here.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.067
- Oh. Why?

03:09.067 --> 03:11.267
- Uh, I'm not sure.

03:13.300 --> 03:17.533
- We wanted to show you
our class hamster.

03:17.533 --> 03:20.233
Oh, my gosh.
Nibbles escaped.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.300
- And he took his cage
with him.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.933
- My homework too.

03:23.933 --> 03:27.167
- Before we look for hamsters,
let's find Mr. Fi--

03:27.167 --> 03:29.433
- Oh, hello,
Principal Mullins.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.333
I didn't hear you come in.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.067
- But I--
I mean, you--

03:33.067 --> 03:34.467
- I know.

03:34.467 --> 03:37.767
We're all at a loss
for words about Nibbles.

03:37.767 --> 03:38.900
But life goes on.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.300
- Well, don't worry,
children.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.533
I'm sure your hamster
will turn up.

03:48.467 --> 03:50.667
You know, I have some extras
in my office.

03:50.667 --> 03:51.900
Black or brown?

03:51.900 --> 03:53.300
- Black, please.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.533
[all sigh]

03:57.533 --> 03:59.233
- Whew!

03:59.233 --> 04:01.567
Thanks for covering
for me, guys.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.500
- You need to be careful,
Mr. Finn.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.733
You've been late a lot,

04:04.733 --> 04:06.833
and Principal Mullins
hates tardiness.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.367
- What? When have I ever
been late before?

04:10.367 --> 04:13.933
[whistling]

04:18.067 --> 04:21.900
Good morning, students.
[school bell rings]

04:21.900 --> 04:23.067
Good work, guys.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.167
You nailed it.

04:24.167 --> 04:25.167
Great effort.

04:25.167 --> 04:27.967
See you guys tomorrow!

04:27.967 --> 04:30.133
Okay, fine.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.967
But let's get started.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.800
We still need to find
one more amazing, original song

04:34.800 --> 04:36.733
to end our set
at the Battle of the Bands.

04:36.733 --> 04:38.300
- What about our poetry
homework?

04:38.300 --> 04:40.067
- Songwriting is poetry.

04:40.067 --> 04:43.867
If you'd ever listen to AC/DC,
you'd know that.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.500
Great bands can't exist
without great songwriting.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.400
- So who's our songwriter?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.300
- We don't have one
but don't worry.

04:50.300 --> 04:54.433
I put an ad online, so I'm sure
we'll find a great songwriter,

04:54.433 --> 04:56.700
and hopefully,
I'll sell that futon.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.067
- I'll be our songwriter.

04:58.067 --> 05:00.067
- Have you ever written
a song before?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.667
- No, but I do write
our family's newsletter.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.133
Uncle Mark went to Peru.

05:04.133 --> 05:08.133
- Oh, well,
felicidades to Uncle Mark.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.500
But it isn't that easy.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.633
Songwriting is a craft
you have to work at.

05:11.633 --> 05:12.933
It takes time.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.433
You got to write hundreds
of songs

05:14.433 --> 05:15.967
before you can master the art.

05:19.467 --> 05:20.800
What's this?

05:20.800 --> 05:23.300
- 100 songs.
I wrote them.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.567
- Since yesterday?
- I know.

05:25.567 --> 05:28.367
I would've written more, except
I had to do my algebra homework,

05:28.367 --> 05:32.400
which was the motivation
for my song "Algebra Homework."

05:32.400 --> 05:33.833
- "Y equals five.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.367
Why, oh, why must
Y equal five?"

05:37.367 --> 05:39.733
- Instant classic.

05:39.733 --> 05:41.433
- Mm-hmm.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.633
There's another song here,
"Grocery List,"

05:43.633 --> 05:47.067
that looks like
it's just a grocery list.

05:47.067 --> 05:50.367
"Apples, paper towels,
bread, bread, bread."

05:50.367 --> 05:52.600
- "Bread" is the chorus.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.933
- Ah, ha ha.
- Yeah.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.633
- Um...

05:55.633 --> 05:59.867
Summer, I respect you
too much to lie to you,

05:59.867 --> 06:02.667
so I'm gonna give you
some constructive criticism.

06:02.667 --> 06:06.333
- Okay.
- These songs are awful.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.500
Like, crazy bad.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.133
- Mr. Finn,
constructive criticism

06:11.133 --> 06:13.867
is supposed to be
about specific things.

06:13.867 --> 06:16.833
- Well, specifically,
this...

06:16.833 --> 06:19.433
is terrible.

06:19.433 --> 06:22.867
- I get it. I'm not good enough
for anything in this band.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.567
- Oh, come on.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.467
If you really
want to write a song,

06:26.467 --> 06:27.700
look at some of
your favorite artists

06:27.700 --> 06:29.733
and find out
how they do it.

06:29.733 --> 06:32.067
- You mean like
a research project?

06:32.067 --> 06:34.433
- I call it sitting around
and listening to music,

06:34.433 --> 06:36.900
but whatever works.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.500
- Thanks, Mr. Finn.
I'm on it.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.133
- Anytime.

06:41.133 --> 06:43.967
* Y equals five
Why, oh, why does Y-- *

06:43.967 --> 06:47.500
Just 'cause I'm singing it
doesn't mean it's good.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.200
[rock music]

06:50.200 --> 06:51.733
Pop quiz--

06:51.733 --> 06:55.667
Van Halen with David Lee Roth
or Van Halen with Sammy Hagar?

06:55.667 --> 06:58.833
- Trick question. Both.
- Oh, Mr. Finn, Mr. Finn.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.400
I'm glad I ran into you.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.833
- Hello, Principal Mullins.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.733
Lovely day, isn't it?

07:03.733 --> 07:06.967
You look very principal-y.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.800
- Thank you.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.500
Mr. Finn, there's something
I'd like to speak

07:11.500 --> 07:12.900
to you about in private.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.767
Can you meet me in my office
this afternoon at 3:00?

07:15.767 --> 07:17.467
- Oh, private meeting.

07:17.467 --> 07:18.867
What are we gonna do--

07:18.867 --> 07:20.900
talk smack about all
the teachers we can't stand?

07:20.900 --> 07:22.667
Love it.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.067
I'll bring snacks.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.367
Pound it.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.267
- I don't know
what's happening right now.

07:27.267 --> 07:29.433
- Yeah.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.500
What's up, fellas?

07:31.500 --> 07:33.233
Why are your mouths
open like that?

07:33.233 --> 07:36.133
- Principal Mullins said
she wanted to speak with you,

07:36.133 --> 07:37.767
in private.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.533
- You don't think
she wants to date, do you?

07:39.533 --> 07:44.200
I really don't need the drama of
a workplace romance right now.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.833
- When Principal Mullins
speaks to a teacher,

07:46.833 --> 07:48.800
it's almost always
to fire them.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.067
- Wait. You think
she wants to fire me?

07:51.067 --> 07:52.233
- I hope not.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.100
This school would stink
without you here.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.500
It would just be
like...school.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.667
- It's true, Mr. Finn.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.133
Thanks to you,
I've got confidence.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.267
Plus, you helped me work
on my game with the ladies.

08:02.267 --> 08:05.800
- Hi, Lawrence.
- What's up, Esme?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.933
I'm falling.

08:11.167 --> 08:14.167
In the old days,
that would have gone badly.

08:14.167 --> 08:16.667
- You have to impress
Principal Mullins in the meeting

08:16.667 --> 08:18.133
and keep your job.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.933
So far, you've only had
to deal with Mullins

08:19.933 --> 08:21.567
for five minutes, tops.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.067
- This is
an actual meeting.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.367
You're looking at a full
half hour of good behavior.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.767
- You're right, my record
for good behavior is 11 minutes.

08:27.767 --> 08:29.433
I'm toast.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.067
- No, we can help you.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.067
I know what it takes
to impress adults.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.933
I've been fooling
my friends' moms into thinking

08:34.933 --> 08:36.767
I'm a good influence
for years.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.200
- It's true. My mom's all, "Why
can't you be more like Freddy?"

08:40.200 --> 08:42.833
She brought a picture
of him to my last haircut.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.067
- Mm. That's just weird.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.933
And the barber
didn't even come close.

08:47.933 --> 08:49.800
- You've taught us
how to be rock stars.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.433
Now let us teach you
how to behave like an adult.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.900
- Okay, mold me.
- Lesson one--

08:54.900 --> 08:58.533
at the meeting,
don't wear flip-flops.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.100
- How would she ever
even notice?

09:00.100 --> 09:03.133
[sandals flopping loudly]

09:03.133 --> 09:06.167
[rock music]

09:06.167 --> 09:08.233
- Oh, no,
here comes my brother.

09:08.233 --> 09:09.667
What do you think
it's gonna be today,

09:09.667 --> 09:11.500
make fun of my height,
my hair,

09:11.500 --> 09:12.667
or punch me in the arm?

09:12.667 --> 09:14.833
- Hey. You're short.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.233
Your hair looks dumb.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.067
- Is that all
you losers got?

09:19.067 --> 09:20.333
My grandma
hits harder than--

09:20.333 --> 09:22.133
- Tomika, shh!

09:22.133 --> 09:24.600
- Guys, guys, guys, I've been
researching Taylor Swift,

09:24.600 --> 09:26.967
and I figured out
how to write way better songs

09:26.967 --> 09:28.067
for us to play together.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.567
Good-bye, eraser clapper.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.500
Hello, songwriter.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.533
- I thought your song
"Texting with Tomika"

09:33.533 --> 09:34.900
was pretty catchy.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.833
- Thanks.
But Taylor's songs

09:36.833 --> 09:39.167
are all about dating
and breakups and stuff.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.900
So I'm gonna do
what she does.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.800
I'm going to find a boyfriend,
break up with him,

09:42.800 --> 09:44.867
and wear cute boots.

09:44.867 --> 09:47.633
- You look so cute
in cute boots.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.533
But getting a boyfriend
sounds hard.

09:49.533 --> 09:51.667
- I don't need a real boyfriend,
just someone to pretend,

09:51.667 --> 09:53.100
so I can write great songs.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.767
He doesn't even have to
"like me" like me.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.367
- No way!

10:00.367 --> 10:02.800
Not interested.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.133
- You're so funny, Zacky.

10:07.133 --> 10:08.933
I'm so lucky
I'm your girlfriend,

10:08.933 --> 10:11.200
which, in turn,
makes you my boyfriend.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.433
- Yo, Zack.

10:12.433 --> 10:14.100
- Oh.
Hey, Ashton.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.333
My arm's really sore.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.700
Can you just punch me
in the face?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.233
- I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

10:19.233 --> 10:21.500
- She's not my girl--
- That's baller, bro.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.300
Makes me not want
to punch you.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.133
- Okay, I'll do it.
I'm your boyfriend.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.767
- Yay.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.000
I mean, of course I will.

10:43.867 --> 10:46.033
- My boyfriend
will be paying.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.233
Boop.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.467
- Better than
getting punched.

10:51.467 --> 10:55.367
I'm just gonna go
dump our trays, honey-boo.

10:55.367 --> 10:59.333
- Speaking of dumping, I think
it's time for us to break up.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.633
- Break up?

11:00.633 --> 11:03.733
We just started dating
a half hour ago.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.167
- I know,

11:05.167 --> 11:09.700
and it's been a super-special
half hour, Zack.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.567
I've gotten so much
out of this relationship--

11:12.567 --> 11:14.067
the highs, the lows,

11:14.067 --> 11:17.533
the 28 minutes in the middle
where not much happened.

11:17.533 --> 11:19.233
- Uh, okay.

11:19.233 --> 11:21.667
But I'm gonna pretend
you're still my girlfriend,

11:21.667 --> 11:23.067
not because I like you.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.767
I like not getting punched.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.267
Good.
You're here.

11:34.267 --> 11:36.067
Zack's amp's
been shaking funny,

11:36.067 --> 11:39.667
and we were hoping you could sit
on it to dampen the noise.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.833
- What?
I'm no amp dampener.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.833
I am a songwriter.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.133
I did what you said,
and I wrote a relationship song,

11:46.133 --> 11:48.733
just like Taylor Swift does.

11:48.733 --> 11:53.233
- "'A Relationship Song,
Just Like Taylor Swift Does'...

11:58.067 --> 11:59.633
Summer, I'm sorry.

11:59.633 --> 12:02.767
I know how badly you want
to write songs for the band,

12:02.767 --> 12:05.333
but these words
just feel fake.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.433
It's like this whole boyfriend
thing was made up.

12:07.433 --> 12:10.267
- It's not!
It's real.

12:10.267 --> 12:13.100
You don't see my brother
out there, do you?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.067
- So, I still don't get
to write our song

12:15.067 --> 12:16.900
for Battle of the Bands?

12:16.900 --> 12:20.767
What am I supposed to do now?

12:20.767 --> 12:23.833
Fine.
I'll get on the amp.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.633
your job depends
on you acting like an adult

12:51.633 --> 12:53.600
in your meeting
with Principal Mullins.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.167
- So we've come up
with a way to train you.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.933
- You mean teach me?

12:57.933 --> 12:59.700
- Yeah, sure.

You're gonna pretend like you're
talking to Principal Mullins.

Whenever you do something right,
you get a treat.

- I don't like that.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.467
You said this was
an ab sculptor.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.067
- Would you have worn it
if I told you

13:18.067 --> 13:19.800
it was a homemade
shock machine?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.733
- If it gave me a six-pack.

13:22.733 --> 13:25.133
- Now, Lawrence is going to
greet you as Principal Mullins.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.500
Greet her with a handshake,
not a fist bump,

13:27.500 --> 13:29.967
and do not call her "bro,"
"man," or "dude."

13:29.967 --> 13:32.067
Got it?

Principal Mullins rescheduled it
to tomorrow at 7:45 a.m.

14:23.533 --> 14:24.667
- What?

14:24.667 --> 14:26.133
The only way
you'd be here that early

14:26.133 --> 14:27.633
is if you slept
at the school.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.100
- Yeah.
- Yes, sleep at the school.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.800

just isn't your thing.

It has to be.

a thing but me.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.067
What am I doing wrong?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.767

writing from your head

14:52.767 --> 14:55.767
and write from your heart.

14:55.767 --> 14:58.367
Music is about a feeling.

than a feeling.

19:51.533 --> 19:52.833
It's the beginning
of the school day.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.933
I'm here, and Summer's not.

19:55.933 --> 19:59.600
I'm very disappointed
in the both of us.

20:04.633 --> 20:07.567
- Amp dampener,
reporting for duty.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.467
- Are you okay?

20:09.467 --> 20:11.000
You don't look like you.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.567
- I wouldn't rule out
body snatchers.

20:14.567 --> 20:17.800
- I tried everything,
but I couldn't do it.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.000
I will never write a great song
for the band.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.933
- Summer, it's okay.

20:21.933 --> 20:24.867
So you can't write a song.
So what?

20:24.867 --> 20:28.333
It's no reason to give up on,
by the looks of it, life.

20:28.333 --> 20:31.700
- It's not
just about a song.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.067
I feel like I'm not
in the band.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.300
I am always left out.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.033
I mean, everybody
knows where they go.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.333
They get to do what they do.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.500
You're all playing
the same song,

20:41.500 --> 20:44.267
and I can't even sing along.

20:44.267 --> 20:46.533
I just want to be with them,

20:46.533 --> 20:49.633
but I'm outside looking in.

20:49.633 --> 20:51.967
- Summer, do you see
what you just did?

20:51.967 --> 20:53.500
- Humiliated myself?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.267
- No, you wrote a song.

20:55.267 --> 20:58.600
Say that again,
that part about being left out.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.500
- Everybody knows where they go.
- Keep going.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.433
- They get to do what they do.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.767
- Chord change.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.400
- You're all playing
the same song,

21:06.400 --> 21:08.367
and I can't even sing along.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.467
I just want to be with them,
but I'm outside looking in.

21:13.067 --> 21:15.800
both: * I just want
to be with them *

21:15.800 --> 21:18.567
*But I'm outside looking in *

21:18.567 --> 21:22.067
* Let me in, let me in

21:22.067 --> 21:23.600
* Oh, oh

21:23.600 --> 21:27.300
* Let me in, let me in

21:27.300 --> 21:29.500
* Oh, oh

21:29.500 --> 21:32.267
- * I just want
to be with them *

21:32.267 --> 21:34.433
* But I'm outside looking in *

21:34.433 --> 21:37.900
both:
* Let me in, let me in

21:37.900 --> 21:39.933
* Oh, oh

21:39.933 --> 21:42.100
* Let me in

21:42.100 --> 21:43.933
- Yeah!

21:43.933 --> 21:46.100
I think we've just found
our killer new song

21:46.100 --> 21:49.467
for Battle of the Bands.

21:49.467 --> 21:51.400
- Way to go, Summer.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.067
- I used to date her.
