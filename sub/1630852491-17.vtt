00:01.502 --> 00:03.504
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.537 --> 00:04.872
REBECCA:
Any Sunday my dad

00:04.905 --> 00:07.007
had to go into the office,
he would, uh,

00:07.041 --> 00:09.543
take me on the train
to the city with him.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.979
I loved those Sundays.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.014
You and the girls and Beth
should get here

00:14.048 --> 00:15.316
as soon as you can.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.052
They're saying
it won't be long now.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.820
ADULT ANNIE:
It's not gonna stay
a secret long

00:19.853 --> 00:21.322
if you keep touching
your belly like that.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.857
-What? I didn't touch my belly.
-Mm-hmm.

00:23.891 --> 00:24.892
You okay, Dej?

00:24.925 --> 00:26.860
I'm fine.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.963
Um, let's-let's go see her.

00:37.871 --> 00:43.411
So, looks like we get off
next exit, 6.8 miles.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.614
(chuckles)
Thanks for the 24-hour heads-up.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.449
Eyes on the road, please.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.352
With this eye candy
sitting right next to me?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.087
I'll try, but no promises.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.188
(laughs)

00:54.222 --> 00:55.723
Marcus gets me.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.791
Mm. Well, God help you both.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.927
Eyes on road.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.962
(groans)
This is taking forever.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.597
You drive like an old man.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.467
Let me tell you something,
my petulant daughter.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.703
One day, you'll remember
enjoying this precious time,

01:09.737 --> 01:13.073
with your world-class mother,
your Denzel-esque father...

01:13.107 --> 01:15.209
-(stifled laugh)
-This again?

01:15.243 --> 01:17.611
-You do not look like him.
-I so do.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.280
KENNY:
Driving home from your brother's

01:19.313 --> 01:21.282
travel tournament
where he won MVP

01:21.315 --> 01:22.916
GABRIEL:
Marcus won MVP?

01:22.950 --> 01:24.618
I hadn't heard.
Can you repeat that, like,

01:24.652 --> 01:25.853
-a hundred more times?
-(soft laughter)

01:28.756 --> 01:32.493
-KENNY: Boys.
-MEGAN: Your father's driving.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.562
-Marcus, in your seat.
-Hey.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.130
Seatbelt please, Marcus.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.832
(overlapping chatter)

01:41.469 --> 01:42.503
Kenny!

01:44.338 --> 01:46.374
*

01:52.045 --> 01:54.114
(insects trilling)

01:57.318 --> 01:58.619
Rebecca?

02:00.488 --> 02:01.722
How you doing
in there, honey?

02:16.570 --> 02:19.240
(train rattling)

02:34.988 --> 02:36.657
I'm waiting for someone.

02:41.529 --> 02:45.399
My father always wanted
to take me on a train like this.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.368
(laughs softly)

02:47.401 --> 02:52.340
He'd say, "One day, we're gonna
take a ride on a train where...

02:52.373 --> 02:57.345
people wear tuxedos
and drink Vespers."

02:57.378 --> 03:02.149
I had no idea what a Vesper was,
but I knew I wanted one.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.819
A martini with gin,
vodka and Lillet.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.055
Shaken, never stirred.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.657
James Bond.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.425
That's right.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.429
-(pats seat softly)
-Sit with me.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.003
Remind me the poem?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.339
The one that gave me
the idea for his name.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.175
-"Luzon."
-"Luzon."

03:28.208 --> 03:30.511
Yes.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.813
Dudley Randall.

03:35.383 --> 03:39.086
Will you recite it for me?

03:39.119 --> 03:41.255
"Splendid against the night,

03:41.289 --> 03:44.525
"the searchlights,
the tracers' arcs

03:44.558 --> 03:49.096
and the red flair bombs
filling the eye and the brain."

03:53.967 --> 03:57.805
Would you like to go
to the bar car with me, Rebecca?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.973
I'm waiting for someone.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.344
I know. It's okay.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.649
Come on.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.753
KEVIN:
All right.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.756
All right, everybody?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.458
That is it, the food is ready.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.892
Come on and get it,
it's time to eat.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.960
Got enough food in here
to choke a horse.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.129
-Be right there.
-KEVIN: All right.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.298
Hey, uh,
thanks for doing all this.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.966
Can I, can I chip in, or...

04:25.999 --> 04:28.636
Oh, no. Toby, come on,
don't be silly.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.004
-It's fine.
-Kev, I can pay for my own food.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.474
I was just k-- I'm kidding.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.843
It's a callback
to our old dynamic.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.178
-(laughs)
-Yes. Yes. Yeah.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.948
Seriously, though, uh,
thanks for including me.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.115
I appreciate it.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.752
Mom wouldn't have had it
any other way.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.620
BETH:
Hey. Move, move,
Nicky's going straight

04:46.654 --> 04:48.356
for that orange chicken,
and I'm not getting stuck

04:48.389 --> 04:50.090
with no lame-ass moo shu, Nicky.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.525
(indistinct chatter)

04:53.794 --> 04:55.629
FRANNY:
Here, Daddy. You need to eat.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.431
KEVIN:
Franny, you are so sweet.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.700
PHILIP:
Hey, hey, hey!

04:59.733 --> 05:00.968
-KEVIN: Uh-oh...
-RANDALL: Hey, there.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.135
-Hello.
-We have arrived.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.171
RANDALL:
What's going on? What up, Jack?

05:04.204 --> 05:07.475
-What up, Hail?
-TOBY: Here they are.
Come hug me up.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.510
I didn't think I was gonna get
to see you until I got home.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.145
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, sweetheart.
Hi, how are you?

05:12.179 --> 05:14.948
We're good, but we are all
in desperate need of a pee.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.351
-But, uh...
-Long journey?
-Yes.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.319
Come this way.
Say hi to everybody.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.954
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.391
-KEVIN: Hey, good to see you.
-Hi, everyone.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.058
-KEVIN: Welcome, welcome.
-How's she doing?

05:26.059 --> 05:27.628
She's hanging in. I mean,

05:27.661 --> 05:30.063
well, they say it could be
a couple days to a week, so...

05:30.097 --> 05:31.999
Mm. All right.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.567
Is that orange chicken?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.403
-It was.
-EDIE: Don't worry.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.804
I stashed you some
in the fridge.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.038
Thank you, Edie.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.840
-You are the only one I like.
-(chuckles)

05:39.873 --> 05:41.008
You talk to Kate?

05:41.041 --> 05:43.377
Yeah.
She-she rushed to the airport

05:43.411 --> 05:46.814
and is, uh, boarding a plane
from London any minute.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.315
So she'll be here
in the morning.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.483
KEVIN:
Okay, good.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.818
Well, eat up.
There's plenty of food.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.219
-MADISON: Yeah.
-PHILIP: Thank you.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.354
KEVIN: Those ribs are
a favorite. You love them.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.256
PHILIP:
Oh, I love a rib.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.459
(indistinct chatter)

05:59.793 --> 06:01.194
KEVIN:
He can have a rib.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.263
Quite a tower you got there.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.366
-KEVIN: Terrible.
-(laughter)

06:08.469 --> 06:10.738
We're all just...

06:11.705 --> 06:13.240
...waiting.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.411
Laughing.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.480
Eating Chinese.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.651
Is this even right?

06:25.152 --> 06:28.288
I don't think
there are any rules.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.157
For any of this.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.265
You?

06:38.298 --> 06:39.733
You okay?

06:45.606 --> 06:51.411
If I tell you something big
right now,

06:51.445 --> 06:53.914
you have to promise
not to react.

06:53.947 --> 06:57.417
You have to be totally cool.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.953
If there's one distinguishing
quality of Randall Pearson,

06:59.987 --> 07:01.622
it's that he's
effortlessly cool.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.691
(chuckles):
I'm not playing.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.163
I'm pregnant.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.600
You're gonna be a grandfather.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.538
Don't. Don't.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.612
We're not even married yet.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.847
I just started
my medical residency.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.516
He's working all the time.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.518
You know how he is about work.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.821
May I give you
a very Randall Pearson,

07:33.854 --> 07:35.288
-effortlessly cool hug...
-(chuckles softly)

07:35.322 --> 07:36.824
...that nobody notices?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.458
You may.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.960
But just stop calling yourself

07:39.993 --> 07:41.495
effortlessly cool.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.330
(both chuckling)

07:46.534 --> 07:47.968
-(sniffles)
-(sighs)

07:48.001 --> 07:50.403
(whispers):
I'm very happy, Dej.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.177
Does he know?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.979
(exhales)

07:59.012 --> 08:00.548
I was gonna tell him
after this weekend.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.015
He's working late.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.585
Because what else is new?
(scoffs)

08:05.553 --> 08:07.588
(soft whirring)

08:11.859 --> 08:13.226
(inhales deeply)

08:13.260 --> 08:14.995
(sighs)
Look at me, Frank.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.631
I'm in the prime of my life,
dude.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.867
And I'm here with you
every night,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.301
trying to reduce
cell inflammation

08:21.334 --> 08:23.036
in pancreatic tumors.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.873
Working our tails off.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.242
Well, I worked mine off.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.144
(chuckles softly)
You still have yours.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.180
-(chuckles)
-(beep)

08:43.356 --> 08:45.058
Holy crap.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.238
Excuse me.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.541
I know we wanted her to rest,
but...

09:01.575 --> 09:03.443
Rebecca's blood pressure's
dropping

09:03.476 --> 09:05.746
and her legs
are starting to go cold.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.582
Things are happening
quickly now.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.418
I don't see her making it
through the night.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.787
I think it's time
to start saying goodbyes.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.889
*

09:25.799 --> 09:26.934
-DOCTOR: What's the briefing?
-EMS: Marcus Brooks.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.936
11-year-old male.
Unrestrained passenger

09:28.969 --> 09:30.103
in a motor vehicle crash.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.271
Open fracture
to the right lower leg.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.606
No pulse in foot.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.974
NURSE:
Got two units of blood ready.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.142
Family's in the waiting room.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.148
(insects trilling)

09:42.515 --> 09:44.618
(sighs deeply)

09:44.652 --> 09:48.188
So, should we draw really...
sad straws?

09:49.522 --> 09:52.325
Anybody want
to go say goodbye first?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.930
I'll go.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.342
*

10:23.957 --> 10:26.026
Beth.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.828
What are you doing here?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.032
I just wanted to see you.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.469
I just wanted to say...

10:36.503 --> 10:38.138
(over speaker):
...so much of being a mom

10:38.171 --> 10:40.407
is about faking it, isn't it?

10:41.374 --> 10:44.411
We don't know
what the hell we're doing.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.247
Not when they're young.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.217
Not when they're older.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.722
So we fake it.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.592
We imitate what we think
a mom should be.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.630
I had a good mom.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.098
But, uh...

11:06.066 --> 11:08.035
...we were complicated.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.441
I just want to say...

11:16.176 --> 11:18.478
...all these years,

11:18.511 --> 11:22.115
so many times
when I was faking it...

11:23.583 --> 11:27.587
...I was doing my best
impression of you, Rebecca.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.460
(whispers): I'll take him
the rest of the way, Mama.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.999
Thank you

11:39.032 --> 11:41.835
for helping me with that...

11:41.869 --> 11:43.871
complicated, incredible,

11:43.904 --> 11:47.440
beautiful boy that you raised.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.614
(whispers):
But I got him now.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.785
Rebecca?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.620
The train is moving fast.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.955
We have to keep going, dear.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.930
KATE:
Well, I boarded.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.899
Should be there
in less than 12 hours.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.633
Is everyone there?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.138
Kate, Mom's taken a turn.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.809
We don't think she's
gonna make it through the night.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.380
Oh, my God.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.449
I should have never come
on this trip.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.650
KEVIN:
No.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.585
No, don't-don't say that.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.554
All right? You're doing exactly
what Mom wanted you to do.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.223
-You're taking the big swings.
-Yeah.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.892
Taking your curriculum
international--

12:38.926 --> 12:40.660
there's nothing bigger
than that.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.931
You tell her that I'm on my way.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.132
Do you hear me?

12:45.165 --> 12:47.600
You tell Mom
that her daughter is on her way.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.303
Miss, I have to ask you
to turn off your phone.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.805
Okay.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.907
I got to go.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.775
You tell her. You hear me?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.644
-RANDALL: We will.
-KEVIN: Mm.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.493
DR. K:
Rebecca.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.962
Welcome.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.730
What are you having?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.305
Marcus. Marcus, it's late.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.940
I want to go home to my wife.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.675
She's not much, but
she's better than this place.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.310
Sir, look at this.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.645
We're seeing a small decrease
in cell inflammation.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.847
The drug is working.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.217
No.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.886
Marcus,

13:38.919 --> 13:41.321
do you know how many
cancer drugs are being tested?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.956
How many are ahead of ours?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.157
How many swings

13:44.191 --> 13:45.625
-and misses...
-Sir, d-due respect,

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
-this is very promising.
-It's an interesting result,

13:47.527 --> 13:49.129
and I'll send it up the ladder.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.463
But...

13:50.497 --> 13:51.498
(sighs)

13:51.531 --> 13:53.300
...our funding has run dry.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.767
We're shutting down.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.038
Go home, kid.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.672
You need to make a life
for yourself

13:59.706 --> 14:01.208
outside of this place.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.610
Don't you have someone nice
to be home with?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.747
(insects trilling)

14:18.425 --> 14:19.759
(inhales deeply)

14:19.792 --> 14:21.995
(sighs)

14:22.029 --> 14:23.430
How you doing?

14:23.463 --> 14:25.165
(inhales deeply)

14:25.198 --> 14:26.599
I said what I needed to say.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.903
I'm at peace with it.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.206
Now I just want her to be.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.009
What'd you say to her?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.278
Uh-uh. I'm not tellin'.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.113
Was it about me?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.248
It's a secret.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.250
Ah. I got you.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.090
Well, I got a secret, too.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.191
Hmm.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.193
Mm-hmm.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.728
-And it's a whopper,
if I do say so myself.
-(chuckles softly)

14:55.762 --> 14:56.964
Deja's pregnant.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.065
How the hell did--

14:58.098 --> 14:59.933
Come on, man. She told you?

14:59.967 --> 15:02.569
I'm that girl's mother, Randall.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.937
I knew she was pregnant
before she did.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.805
Oh...

15:07.807 --> 15:09.342
You're gonna be a grandpappy.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.778
You gonna be a meemaw.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.947
Hell no. Anybody call me Meemaw,

15:13.981 --> 15:16.449
-I'm stuffing that baby
right back up inside of her.
-(laughing)

15:16.483 --> 15:17.450
Mm.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.953
(chuckling)

15:26.793 --> 15:29.029
Kev and I are gonna
go in there last.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.665
Stay with her.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.836
I don't know
what I want to say to her.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.473
I want to tell her she can go,

15:40.507 --> 15:42.775
but I don't want to scare her,
you know?

15:42.809 --> 15:45.312
-Just, um...
-(door opens)

15:45.345 --> 15:47.580
I want to get it right.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.417
-(footsteps approaching)
-You will.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.485
You always do.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.926
Old life,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.494
new life.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.264
It's so strange.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.999
(inhales deeply)

16:06.033 --> 16:08.868
The dichotomy, you know?

16:08.901 --> 16:11.038
Not really.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.772
But I married you
so I wouldn't have to learn

16:12.805 --> 16:13.973
-all the big words.
-Mm.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.576
Another bite.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.683
Be with you in just a second,
dear.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.521
CURT GOWDY:
Last chance for the Steelers.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.923
Bradshaw, trying to get away.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.327
And his pass is...

16:34.361 --> 16:36.296
broken up by Tatum.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.497
Picked off!

16:37.530 --> 16:39.999
Franco Harris has it!

16:40.033 --> 16:41.168
And he's over!

16:41.201 --> 16:42.169
Limoncello?

16:42.202 --> 16:44.171
Or is that too on the nose?

16:45.538 --> 16:48.175
Hey, if life gives you lemons...

16:48.208 --> 16:49.476
(chuckles)

16:49.509 --> 16:50.977
(commentators
continue indistinctly)

16:51.010 --> 16:53.146
Actually...

16:53.180 --> 16:55.548
could you make me a Vesper?

16:55.582 --> 16:57.884
-Coming right up.
-(chuckles softly)

17:04.424 --> 17:06.226
Your kids grew up beautifully.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.260
(Randall laughs)

17:07.294 --> 17:08.428
RANDALL:
Now you can see.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.429
You should've got
your glasses earlier,

17:09.462 --> 17:10.597
you know that?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.599
Yeah, you're handsome.
(laughs)

17:12.632 --> 17:15.135
Check it out. Smile.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.205
Looking good.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.806
Kate's not here.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.143
Yeah. I know.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.651
I've spent my whole life
worrying about them.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.987
Wondering...

17:35.988 --> 17:38.125
...what else I could do
for them, and...

17:38.158 --> 17:39.359
and now...

17:39.392 --> 17:42.095
There's nothing left to do.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.433
You trust the process.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.135
And...

17:50.603 --> 17:52.105
...you drink a Vesper.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.773
(chuckles softly)

17:53.806 --> 17:54.841
Thank you.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.481
Mmm.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.216
And you thought
I just delivered babies.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.517
(laughs)

18:05.652 --> 18:07.086
Hmm.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.624
(Rebecca sighs)

18:15.595 --> 18:17.630
I made so many mistakes.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.333
Well, I hate
to break it to you, kiddo,

18:20.367 --> 18:22.469
but I have yet to meet
the parent who says

18:22.502 --> 18:25.004
-"I got it all right."
-(sighs)

18:25.037 --> 18:27.140
No perfect games in parenting.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.508
Not even close.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.378
Hmm.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.616
Can I tell you something?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.785
Something I'm...

18:38.818 --> 18:40.520
not supposed to say?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.694
I, um...

18:50.330 --> 18:52.999
I thought
I was gonna lose you that day.

18:54.501 --> 18:58.137
And I sense
that you felt it, too.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.439
There was a moment,

18:59.472 --> 19:02.342
right after the first child
came out,

19:02.375 --> 19:04.444
and you started crashing.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.348
And that little voice
in my head kept saying,

19:08.381 --> 19:11.718
"You're gonna lose the mother.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.153
Save the children if you can."

19:16.856 --> 19:18.891
But you came through.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.495
You survived.

19:24.531 --> 19:28.968
You survived
just to lose a child

19:29.001 --> 19:30.603
and then a husband.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
And, still...

19:37.377 --> 19:39.846
...what a thing
you made of it all.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.417
What a big,

19:44.451 --> 19:46.353
messy,

19:46.386 --> 19:48.288
gigantic...

19:49.922 --> 19:51.691
...spectacular thing.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.796
I said it to you once.
I say it again.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.767
You're as tough as they come,
Rebecca Pearson.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.936
(shudders)

20:05.137 --> 20:07.340
And you, my dear,

20:07.374 --> 20:09.576
have earned a rest.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.780
William?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.560
Thank you.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.961
For being my doctor.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.129
DR. K:
Eh.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.899
I was only your doctor
that one time.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.103
It was a big one, though.
(chuckles softly)

20:38.104 --> 20:39.972
Yes, it was.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.074
*

20:49.449 --> 20:52.919
All right, now these were
your grandmother's. Right?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.754
And, uh...

20:57.290 --> 21:01.160
...she was her favorite.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.195
Yeah.

21:04.497 --> 21:08.134
And this... this right here...

21:08.167 --> 21:09.336
was my favorite.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.639
("The Circle Game"
by Joni Mitchell begins)

21:12.672 --> 21:15.442
*

21:15.475 --> 21:17.444
Huh? That's the real stuff
right there.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.112
Now, kids only, kids only.
No adults.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.449
-Anybody know who this is?
-Joni Mitchell.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.451
Joni Mitchell! Spot-on.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.118
Very, very nice, Jack.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.355
And, Nicholas, did you know
that when your grandmother

21:28.388 --> 21:30.122
was first diagnosed,
we actually broke into

21:30.156 --> 21:31.858
Joni Mitchell's house?
Did you know that?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.259
It's a true story.
Your grandmother loved

21:33.292 --> 21:34.694
a good B&E.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.795
-(scattered laughter)
-Uh, you know, for the record,

21:35.828 --> 21:36.863
from what I've been told,

21:36.896 --> 21:38.631
you pushed through an open gate

21:38.665 --> 21:40.132
and had a pleasant conversation

21:40.166 --> 21:41.968
in Joni Mitchell's driveway,
but...

21:42.001 --> 21:43.803
I don't know who told you that,
but you know, I'll tell you,

21:43.836 --> 21:46.606
-just let a tall tale
be a tall tale.
-RANDALL: That's my bad.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.109
Didn't, uh, Rebecca take
a road trip to L.A. with Jack

21:50.142 --> 21:51.310
on their third date?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.880
A ballsy third date
by my brother.

21:53.913 --> 21:57.517
-(laughter)
-Now, your Uncle Nicky
took me to Olive Garden

21:57.550 --> 22:00.787
-on our third date.
-HAILEY: That's very impressive.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.954
NICKY:
You said you loved Olive Garden,

22:01.988 --> 22:03.390
so I took you to Olive Garden.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.558
And I don't remember you
complaining.

22:05.592 --> 22:08.528
You know, we were just talking
about your road trip with Jack.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.732
You two really had

22:12.765 --> 22:16.403
a once-in-a-lifetime love story.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.970
Just like me and Kevin.

22:18.004 --> 22:21.474
* And go 'round and 'round
and 'round *

22:21.508 --> 22:24.544
* In the circle game *

22:24.577 --> 22:28.147
Minus all the turbulence
and psychotherapy, obviously.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.883
Even when your daughter and I
were at our worst,

22:30.917 --> 22:33.185
you never stopped
believing in me.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.222
I hope I turned out to be
the father

22:36.255 --> 22:38.658
that you always knew
I could be,

22:38.691 --> 22:40.660
even though things
didn't work out

22:40.693 --> 22:41.928
the way that we thought
they would.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.996
(chuckles)

22:44.030 --> 22:47.500
Uh, Rebecca, you can tell me.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.603
You love me more
than Philip, right?

22:50.637 --> 22:53.673
You know Rebecca was a low-key
Pearson matchmaker?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.007
RANDALL:
Mm.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.509
Even when I was unsure
about marrying Randall...

22:56.543 --> 22:57.677
Now, hold on now. Wait.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.778
Unsure about marrying me?

22:58.811 --> 23:01.013
Oh, come on,
it's R&B legend, Boo.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.615
Own it. Okay?

23:02.649 --> 23:05.585
-You're talking nonsense, woman.
-(Beth laughs)

23:05.618 --> 23:07.454
You know it's R&B for life.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.789
It is R&B for life. It is.

23:09.822 --> 23:10.957
Okay, okay.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.392
You guys are way too old
for this much PDA.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.927
RANDALL:
What are you talking about?

23:14.961 --> 23:17.296
-How do you think you got here?
-HAILEY: Look away.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.965
ANNIE:
Okay, I'm out of here.

23:18.998 --> 23:23.603
* Behind from where we came,
and go 'round... *

23:23.636 --> 23:26.773
I always felt so small
in this family.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.075
Everyone else was so big.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.744
So loud.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.980
Do you remember
what you said to me?

23:34.013 --> 23:36.716
You told me that
it's okay to be small,

23:36.749 --> 23:39.719
as long as I didn't
think of myself as small.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.622
That quiet was okay.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.091
As long as I wasn't afraid
to be loud.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.559
MADISON:
Beth,

23:46.593 --> 23:50.663
do you remember
my bachelorette--

23:50.697 --> 23:53.933
-the-the first one.
-(laughter)

23:53.966 --> 23:56.102
-MADISON: Sorry.
-ELIJAH: I don't think I've
actually heard this story.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.270
-Please, no, no, no, go on.
-Uh...

23:58.304 --> 24:00.773
So Kate hired a...
What was it?

24:00.807 --> 24:02.742
-What was his official title?
-Stripper.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.110
-MADISON: A stripper.
-(laughter)

24:04.143 --> 24:05.311
A stripper that we painted.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.279
Oh, gosh, will you look
at the time.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.015
I think it's time for
the kids to go to bed.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.784
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

24:11.818 --> 24:13.285
Madison, thank you
for the stripper story.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.453
-Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
-Appreciate that.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.688
-Sorry, kids. Kids...
-RANDALL: No, no.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.490
-It's all good.
-She was always there.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.825
She was always there.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.460
And I didn't know that,
you know, at the time,

24:21.494 --> 24:22.795
his relationship with his mom.
And I didn't realize...

24:22.829 --> 24:26.165
My mother and I are close.
I won't be judged.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.200
Bye.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.702
-RANDALL: Have a good night.
-Good night, everybody.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.037
-Good night.
-* And 'round *

24:31.070 --> 24:32.539
* In the circle game *

24:32.572 --> 24:34.173
(Randall sighs)

24:34.206 --> 24:35.775
First of all, she said
you're an idiot.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.976
And then she said...

24:37.009 --> 24:38.678
-Shat did she...
-I told you, she's a low-key,

24:38.711 --> 24:40.146
-she's a low-key matchmaker.
-KEVIN: No.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.282
-RANDALL: What did she say?
-KEVIN: Okay, good night.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.951
RANDALL:
Good night, Soph.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.219
-We'll make it.
-Are you okay?

24:47.253 --> 24:50.489
* Behind from where we came *

24:50.523 --> 24:53.492
* And go 'round and 'round
and 'round... *

24:53.526 --> 24:55.995
-Good night.
-See you in the morning.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.731
* Game *

24:58.765 --> 25:02.535
* And go 'round and 'round
and 'round *

25:02.569 --> 25:06.072
* In the circle game. *

25:11.678 --> 25:14.013
(insects trilling outside)

25:20.252 --> 25:22.488
Hey, Mom.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.693
It's us.
Kevin and Randall.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.098
Kate's on her way,
but she wanted you to know

25:32.131 --> 25:34.066
that she's here in spirit.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.569
Yeah.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.739
So, um...

25:39.772 --> 25:42.241
she's with us here, too.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.584
-Oh.
-(sighs heavily)

26:06.799 --> 26:08.200
-(chuckles)
-Mm.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.269
(mumbles)

26:10.302 --> 26:13.640
Do you remember that time
Kate got appendicitis,

26:13.673 --> 26:16.108
we had to take her
to the hospital? Thanksgiving?

26:16.142 --> 26:19.311
No, it was Christmas.
I got a snow globe.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.580
Mm...

26:21.614 --> 26:22.949
No, I'm sure of it.
I wouldn't have bought

26:22.982 --> 26:24.951
a snow globe
if it was Thanksgiving.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.186
Fair enough.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.257
-Question.
-Hmm?

26:31.290 --> 26:33.760
Pilgrim Rick.
A real-life person,

26:33.793 --> 26:34.961
or did we just make him up?

26:34.994 --> 26:37.296
(laughs)

26:37.329 --> 26:38.597
I think Dad made him up.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.733
See, I think he was
a real-life person.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.135
'Cause Dad, he wasn't that
creative a storyteller, right?

26:43.169 --> 26:46.238
I don't think he could just
conjure up Pilgrim Rick.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.140
Fair enough.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.343
-Yeah.
-(Randall chuckles)

26:55.447 --> 26:57.349
Strangely ripped for a dad
in the '90s, wasn't he?

26:57.383 --> 26:58.617
-Did a lot of pushups.
-Loved 'em.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.186
-Yeah.
-Couldn't get enough.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.287
Remember that thing
he used to do with you?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.621
He would put you on his back

27:02.655 --> 27:03.790
at the karate place, the...

27:03.823 --> 27:06.793
-Dojo.
-Dojo. Yeah.

27:11.864 --> 27:15.101
You know, Mom once drove me
to go get my John Smiley

27:15.134 --> 27:18.104
-baseball card autographed.
-Hmm.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.741
99% sure John Smiley
had a crush on Mom.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.045
Everyone had a crush on Mom.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.749
Yeah.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.790
I like that she kept
your painting up.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.793
(Randall chuckles)

27:40.827 --> 27:43.295
It's actually not bad.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.031
No, it's not.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.136
Should I have been
a professional painter?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.838
You should not have been.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.873
(both laugh)

27:55.708 --> 27:58.410
I wonder if any of this is
getting through to her.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.367
*

28:31.610 --> 28:33.645
MIGUEL:
Hey, you.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.318
Hey, you.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.356
Great nose, great legs.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.292
You like the wine.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.328
Oh, I wasn't talking
about the wine.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.465
You know, I still...

28:53.499 --> 28:57.103
I still can't get over it
after all of these years.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.604
It's still you.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.940
What?

29:00.973 --> 29:03.810
My favorite person.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.314
Rebecca?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.599
Dej.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.941
Hey.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.477
Malik.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.179
The nurse let me in.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.614
I ran out of the restaurant
when I got your text.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.851
Oh...

29:47.786 --> 29:50.923
I know we weren't
expecting this,

29:50.957 --> 29:52.925
and I know it's complicated.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.894
It really isn't, Dej.

29:56.162 --> 29:59.098
I've loved you since
I was 16.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.168
*

30:02.201 --> 30:05.137
I want to marry you.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.906
I want to have
this baby with you.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.442
(chuckles)

30:10.476 --> 30:12.912
(both laugh)

30:18.350 --> 30:21.320
Oh, Lord,
someone's in a mood.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.655
Oh, another long night
with the rats?

30:24.857 --> 30:26.492
Our funding got shut down.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.360
The drug didn't work.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.863
Not enough, anyway.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.631
I just spent years
chasing something

30:32.664 --> 30:34.934
that led to nothing, so...

30:35.902 --> 30:39.038
Bro, are you seriously mad
'cause you didn't cure cancer

30:39.071 --> 30:40.339
on the first try?

30:40.372 --> 30:42.174
(scoffs)

30:42.208 --> 30:43.642
Yeah, I know.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.478
I don't know, I'm just...
I'm just down.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.181
I just thought this was
the big thing I was meant to do.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.886
(monitor beeping)

30:55.554 --> 30:58.590
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

30:58.624 --> 31:00.326
The nurse said he's still
in the OR.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.395
They're waiting for
a trauma surgeon.

31:03.429 --> 31:08.134
They're concerned about
blood circulation to his foot.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.770
GABRIEL:
It's my fault.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.873
I shouldn't have smacked
the ball away from him.

31:14.907 --> 31:19.245
Hey. Hey. Look at me.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.080
It was an accident.

31:21.113 --> 31:25.651
It's no one's fault.
It's no one's fault.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.487
Marcus is gonna be fine.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.392
Listen to me.

31:33.425 --> 31:37.663
It's gonna be a long night,
but he's gonna be fine.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.470
Um, I'm gonna go
get us some coffee.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.960
(coffee running)

32:10.129 --> 32:13.499
Vending machines are next door,
if you're looking for those.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.069
Oh, no.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.504
Just coffee.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.474
Well, you're in the right spot
for that,

32:22.508 --> 32:25.978
if you can legally
call this stuff coffee.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.659
Long night?

32:40.692 --> 32:42.928
(sighs)

32:42.961 --> 32:44.763
Yeah.

32:44.796 --> 32:45.998
JACK:
Yeah.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.637
Yeah, my house burned down.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.973
Whole thing.
Middle of the night.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.143
Just, poof!

32:57.176 --> 32:59.578
Barely got the family out.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.582
-Jesus.
-Yeah.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.020
Everyone okay?

33:08.054 --> 33:10.189
Yeah.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.859
I got a little dinged up,
so I'll just

33:13.892 --> 33:16.795
wait for 'em to take me in,
check my hands out

33:16.828 --> 33:19.498
and run a few tests.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.304
My family was in
a car accident.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.240
Everyone all right?

33:30.876 --> 33:33.379
No, actually.

33:35.081 --> 33:39.285
My son Marcus,
he's in surgery.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.024
Sorry.

33:46.058 --> 33:49.528
You're pretty much catching me
on the worst night of my life.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.563
TIFFANY:
Hey, come on now.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.699
What did Dad always say?

33:53.732 --> 33:56.335
Oh, no. Please, no. I can't...

33:56.368 --> 33:58.937
I can't listen to
some greeting card platitude

33:58.970 --> 34:01.473
about lemons right now, no.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.844
You know what?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.613
I was here 18 years ago,

34:07.646 --> 34:11.550
a night not too different
than tonight.

34:11.583 --> 34:15.020
One of those nights
that changes everything.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.189
And, uh,

34:17.223 --> 34:20.859
a pretty smart guy,

34:20.892 --> 34:22.594
he said a pretty smart thing
to me.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.898
-What does it even mean?!
-No, look, look.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.768
He was saying that
even the darkest moment

34:29.801 --> 34:31.437
can turn into something sweet.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.071
With lemonade?

34:33.105 --> 34:36.242
With something
resembling lemonade.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.444
-How is this our family motto?!
-(laughter)

34:38.477 --> 34:40.612
What is wrong with you?

34:40.646 --> 34:43.415
GABRIEL:
You know Dad! (laughs)

34:43.449 --> 34:44.883
NURSE:
O2 sat is dropping.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.652
Heart rate is dropping.

34:47.986 --> 34:49.788
-Loss of pulse.
-Starting CPR.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.391
Call Dr. Spencer, now.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.261
SPENCER:
I want you applying the cream
every 12 hours, okay?

34:55.294 --> 34:57.696
-You took in a tremendous amount
of smoke.
-(clearing throat)

35:01.200 --> 35:02.834
(alarm beeping)

35:05.003 --> 35:08.006
-Okay, talk to me.
-I think it's a fat embolism.

35:08.039 --> 35:10.108
Recommending anti-coagulation
now.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.743
Hold it, stop.
He could bleed out.

35:11.777 --> 35:15.947
-Continue CPR.
-(rapid beeping continues)

35:15.981 --> 35:18.250
*

35:18.284 --> 35:21.953
Okay, I am gonna go make us
hotel reservations.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.589
Gonna call the kids.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.557
(alarm beeping rapidly)

35:28.460 --> 35:30.829
Stop CPR.
I've got a pulse.

35:30.862 --> 35:31.963
(beeping steadies)

35:31.997 --> 35:33.165
Good save.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.702
Dr. Spencer, you're needed
back downstairs

35:36.735 --> 35:38.737
-in the ER stat.
-SPENCER: Thank you.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.545
We lost Pearson in 107.

35:46.578 --> 35:50.015
Cardiac arrest. Lifesaving
measures did not work.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.050
What?

35:56.222 --> 35:59.325
He was presenting normal
not 20 minutes ago.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.631
I had a kid coding upstairs,

36:05.664 --> 36:07.333
and this was just
smoke inhalation.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.501
(exhales)

36:10.702 --> 36:13.104
I've got to find his wife.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.711
SPENCER:
Mrs. Pearson?

36:19.745 --> 36:20.912
Oh.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.122
Mrs. Pearson,
your husband has died.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.593
Your son is gonna be okay.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.896
He has a long recovery
ahead of him.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.965
*

36:55.547 --> 36:57.583
*

37:15.066 --> 37:16.935
No.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.708
I told you
I'm waiting for someone.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.776
(birds singing)

37:26.645 --> 37:29.448
She's a fighter, your mother.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.020
-I'm here if you need me.
-Thank you.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.329
(exhales loudly)

37:45.831 --> 37:49.435
Hey, look at that. The kids are
playing four square.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.838
Would you look at that?

37:52.871 --> 37:55.374
(indistinct chatter outside)

37:59.678 --> 38:01.813
So strange.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.850
The dichotomy, you know?

38:17.563 --> 38:18.997
JACK:
Mom!

38:30.876 --> 38:32.243
RANDALL:
It's okay.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.981
(Kate panting)

38:39.250 --> 38:41.553
Hey, Mom.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.456
It's me. It's Bug.

38:44.490 --> 38:49.094
(over speakers):
I'm here. I'm here.

38:52.030 --> 38:55.066
KATE (sniffles):
I love you, Mom.

38:56.602 --> 38:59.170
I love you so much.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.343
(softly):
Okay.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.756
*

39:42.147 --> 39:44.916
I want to say
the perfect thing to you, Mom,

39:44.950 --> 39:47.052
but, uh...

39:47.085 --> 39:49.888
I'm not sure what that is.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.959
I don't even know
if you can hear me,

39:53.992 --> 39:56.127
but, uh...

39:59.130 --> 40:01.399
...I love you, Mom.

40:03.802 --> 40:07.172
Uh, we're good now.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.810
You made us good.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.586
So, uh...

40:20.619 --> 40:23.254
thanks for all the meals.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.993
Thank you for always
making us feel loved.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.732
Thank you for that one time
you beat down David Adams

40:33.765 --> 40:35.667
for hitting me in the head
with a baseball bat.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.769
(stifled laughter, sobs)

40:43.975 --> 40:46.478
I love you, Ma.

40:49.715 --> 40:52.651
This is quite sad, isn't it?

40:54.820 --> 40:56.955
The end?

40:56.988 --> 40:59.625
Oh, I don't know.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.693
The way I see it,

41:01.727 --> 41:04.295
if something makes you sad
when it ends,

41:04.329 --> 41:07.533
it must have been pretty
wonderful when it was happening.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.136
Truth be told,

41:11.169 --> 41:12.671
I've always felt it
a bit lazy

41:12.704 --> 41:16.642
to just think of the world
as sad,

41:16.675 --> 41:19.177
because so much of it is.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.813
Because everything ends.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.182
Everything dies.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.490
But if you step back...

41:34.159 --> 41:38.664
If you step back and
look at the whole picture...

41:40.599 --> 41:42.467
If you're brave enough
to allow yourself

41:42.500 --> 41:46.672
the gift of a really
wide perspective...

41:47.873 --> 41:49.875
PRESENTER:
And so, for his pioneering role

41:49.908 --> 41:51.342
in the development of drugs

41:51.376 --> 41:53.679
targeting Alzheimer's disease,

41:53.712 --> 41:56.381
we're proud to honor
Dr. Marcus Brooks.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.284
(applause)

42:01.920 --> 42:06.825
You know, this all started
from a number of cancer drugs

42:06.858 --> 42:08.426
that didn't work. Uh...

42:08.459 --> 42:09.895
WILLIAM:
If you do that...

42:11.262 --> 42:15.366
...you'll see that the end
is not sad, Rebecca.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.937
It's just the start of the next

42:18.970 --> 42:22.774
incredibly beautiful thing.

42:25.944 --> 42:29.214
It's like that dopey painting
your son made that time.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.682
(laughs)

42:30.716 --> 42:33.719
Hey, I really love
that painting.

42:37.322 --> 42:39.057
(Rebecca sniffles)

42:44.562 --> 42:46.097
Okay.

42:49.635 --> 42:51.136
(kisses cheek)

43:05.483 --> 43:07.653
(sniffling)

43:18.664 --> 43:21.166
You tell him hey.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.652
*

44:09.848 --> 44:11.883
*

44:18.423 --> 44:19.490
Hey.

44:21.026 --> 44:22.527
Hey.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.700
