19:46.534 --> 19:48.300
I'm keeping you up.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.167
No, no. It's just,
you know, school tomorrow.

19:51.167 --> 19:53.901
So how you doing?

19:54.868 --> 19:56.167
Better.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.200
Better, I guess.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.300
This stuff--

20:00.300 --> 20:04.534
This listening to music
with you

20:04.534 --> 20:07.501
just helps me keep
my mind off things, you know?

20:08.834 --> 20:12.000
It just helps a lot
being with you.

20:15.968 --> 20:18.300
Um, Bailey, you know what,
that's great.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.801
But don't, okay?
Don't do that.

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

That's great.

Anyway, um,

20:47.133 --> 20:50.000
I'll-- I'll help you.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.968
But you kind of have to learn
how to help yourself too.

20:52.968 --> 20:55.701
And believe me, you are.

20:55.701 --> 20:59.367

to make some serious changes.

You know, you need to get away

21:04.734 --> 21:06.567

want to drink,

21:06.567 --> 21:10.801
all the things that remind you
of the partying and alcohol.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.033
You are beautiful
in the morning.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.567
Did I ever tell you that?

21:37.567 --> 21:40.300
Oh, coffee.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.133
God, it is an amazing day
outside today.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.934
I was thinking that we should be
out there,

21:43.934 --> 21:46.434
you know, doing something fun.
You want to do something fun?

21:46.434 --> 21:48.567
Sure, as long as it doesn't
involve mud.

21:48.567 --> 21:51.133
I was thinking we could pack up
some stuff and hop on your bike

21:51.133 --> 21:53.467
and head up to Drake's Beach
through Marin?

21:55.234 --> 21:57.534
Nope.
After breakfast.

21:57.534 --> 21:58.734
Don't you have school?

21:58.734 --> 22:00.300
Yeah. But they're
not gonna miss me.

anything going on there.

I pick you.

22:10.501 --> 22:12.801
Yeah, I mean,
that sounds pretty cool.

22:12.801 --> 22:15.667
It's just, not today.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.400
Why not today?

22:17.400 --> 22:18.968
Today is perfect.

22:18.968 --> 22:21.100
You know what?

22:21.100 --> 22:24.300
I gotta replace the plugs
on my bike.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.901
It's running kind of rough,
so...

22:25.901 --> 22:27.634
Oh, well, how long
is that gonna take?

22:27.634 --> 22:30.734
By the time I go
and pick up the parts, uh,

22:30.734 --> 22:32.100
probably all afternoon.

22:33.601 --> 22:36.234
Maybe-- Maybe Saturday
would be good?

22:38.334 --> 22:40.267
Yeah.

Okay. Maybe.

What time is it?

22:56.100 --> 22:57.634
It's almost 8.

22:57.634 --> 23:01.667
Look, you didn't slip up or
anything last night, did you?

23:01.667 --> 23:03.734
I mean, that's not why
you slept out here, right?

and you were out late.

gonna do that anymore.

it's possible.

of how much I want to drink.

that Pavlov guy or whoever,

24:07.734 --> 24:09.734
because I can't wait
to get to the fridge.

And then I get there and I open
the door, and I remember.

in the <i>Ledger,</i>

a followup piece.

was doing another story

25:56.167 --> 25:58.667
that she'd be really close

in this.

with on his own.

he needs to get away from me.

That's not fair.
I didn't tell him that.

27:25.667 --> 27:29.133
Yes, you did. I mean, there's so
many things that he could do

27:29.133 --> 27:31.534

it all about me,

person

about the accident and--

27:37.801 --> 27:39.968

27:39.968 --> 27:42.567
because you don't want to see
him with me.

to come back to you?

that I'm spending time with him

is because
he says he needs me.

he needs my help.

gonna stand there

doing this

You name the place.

40:59.968 --> 41:01.200
Bailey, you know what?

41:01.200 --> 41:03.000
That's really sweet,
but I can't.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.534
I'm sort of
going out with Drew.

41:06.267 --> 41:09.534
Oh, oh, of course.

41:09.534 --> 41:12.634
Anyway, I should probably,
um...

41:12.634 --> 41:15.534
Ahem. So I'll--
I'll see you?

41:15.534 --> 41:18.133
Yeah, I'll see you.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.934
Sarah.
Hm?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.234
Nothing. Just...

41:27.667 --> 41:30.067
Don't mention it.

41:30.067 --> 41:31.601
[***]

41:47.601 --> 41:51.634
What? You--
You did all this while I--?

41:53.167 --> 41:55.067
You look, uh...

41:55.067 --> 41:56.834
We're celebrating.

41:56.834 --> 41:58.534
We are?
Mm-hm.

41:58.534 --> 42:00.868
Come here.

42:00.868 --> 42:02.033
I want to show you something.

42:07.968 --> 42:11.934
I asked Mr. Langen
to give me a makeup.

42:11.934 --> 42:15.501
I mean, I know how well
you want me to do.

42:17.033 --> 42:19.601
You're doing
pretty well so far.

42:19.601 --> 42:21.734
Good.

42:21.734 --> 42:24.734
Have I ever told you about--?

42:24.734 --> 42:26.601
Heh. What?

42:28.901 --> 42:31.534
The Punic Wars?

42:31.534 --> 42:33.601
No.
Hm.

42:33.601 --> 42:37.501
Well,
there were three of them.

42:37.501 --> 42:40.767
Between Rome and Carthage.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.100
Three of them, huh?
Mm-hm.

42:42.100 --> 42:43.567
Mm. Who won?

42:43.567 --> 42:48.133
Well, Rome captured Carthage,

42:48.133 --> 42:50.634
tore it down by stone by stone.

42:50.634 --> 42:54.534
And sold its inhabitants
into slavery.

42:54.534 --> 42:57.300
Oh, bummer.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.234
All thanks to Cato.

42:59.234 --> 43:00.801
Kaelin?
[CHUCKLES]

43:00.801 --> 43:02.601
The philosopher.

43:02.601 --> 43:03.634
Oh.

43:03.634 --> 43:07.534
He said
 <i>"Delenda est Carthago."</i>

43:07.534 --> 43:09.334
He did?

43:09.334 --> 43:11.934
Yeah.

43:11.934 --> 43:13.701
Yeah? What's it mean?

43:13.701 --> 43:16.667
Well, it means

43:16.667 --> 43:20.300
"Carthage must be destroyed."

43:21.367 --> 43:22.467
Ah.

43:22.467 --> 43:23.901
[GIGGLES]

43:28.067 --> 43:30.400
