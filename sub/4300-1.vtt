00:24.566 --> 00:26.659
Where are you headed, little lady?

00:27.269 --> 00:29.897
Nowhere with you, numb-nuts. Buzz off!

00:37.679 --> 00:40.045
See you Thursday, you gorgeous thing.

00:45.521 --> 00:47.853
You picked a beautiful day to hitchhike.

00:47.923 --> 00:52.019
Well, I've got a nice little VW back
at Stenson's Beach with a cracked block.

00:54.030 --> 00:57.261
You guys wouldn't be going up
to Mill Valley, would you?

00:58.001 --> 01:00.094
Andy, aren't we going up to Mill Valley?

01:00.170 --> 01:04.402
I got a couple of bottles of ice-cold beer
up there, if you're interested.

01:08.478 --> 01:10.378
You son of a bitch.

01:12.515 --> 01:14.278
Okay, pile in.

01:41.811 --> 01:45.474
How long you been in the Western Gas
and Electric Company business?

01:45.582 --> 01:48.983
I can't remember how long I've been in it.
How long have I been in it?

01:55.092 --> 01:56.218
Turn in, right here.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.293
Climb up this road here.

02:25.689 --> 02:27.884
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

06:01.943 --> 06:05.037
Better hang a left here, Harry.
There's a jam up on Bay.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.696
What's with the citizen?

06:42.117 --> 06:43.948
Police officer, what's the problem?

06:44.019 --> 06:46.647
Thank God. He's inside.

06:48.690 --> 06:50.658
Come on, it's a heart attack.

06:50.893 --> 06:52.588
Wait here.

06:54.096 --> 06:56.326
Make some room, please.
Please, move aside.

06:56.398 --> 06:58.866
Please, move aside. This is an emergency.

07:01.937 --> 07:03.962
Excuse us. Would you please move over.

07:04.039 --> 07:07.236
Would you please give us room.
He's a police officer.

07:07.442 --> 07:10.775
- Police? Where's the ambulance?
- This poor man's had a heart attack.

07:10.846 --> 07:13.041
I think he's still breathing, though.

07:19.187 --> 07:20.415
Come on, get up.

07:20.489 --> 07:23.754
- Get up. Come on.
- What are you doing?

07:30.332 --> 07:31.891
I say.

07:33.069 --> 07:35.469
- Party's over.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.

07:36.105 --> 07:37.663
What are you squawking about?

07:37.740 --> 07:39.537
You got the free meal, didn't you?

07:39.609 --> 07:42.874
Yeah, but I always enjoy the ride
in the ambulance.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.373
Get out of here.

07:46.749 --> 07:48.239
<i>All units, be advised that this is a 406.</i>

07:48.585 --> 07:50.519
<i>Harry, it's an ''all units.''</i>

07:52.755 --> 07:54.347
Marvelous.

07:57.193 --> 07:58.922
My old lady's gonna kill me.

07:58.995 --> 08:03.932
She's doing a nine-church novena tonight
and I told her I'd be home early for supper.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.632
<i>Suspects are armed.</i>

08:11.874 --> 08:14.172
<i>Code 33. Code 33.</i>

08:14.344 --> 08:18.110
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

08:30.728 --> 08:32.025
What's going on?

08:32.096 --> 08:35.121
A couple of bastards
held up that liquor store.

08:35.299 --> 08:38.700
One of our guys stumbled in on it
and they shot him up.

08:38.802 --> 08:40.394
They grabbed four hostages.

08:40.471 --> 08:44.270
They said they'll start shooting them
one by one unless we give them a car.

08:44.341 --> 08:45.808
Then what are you waiting on?

08:45.876 --> 08:47.844
Lieutenant Brannigan of Robbery.

08:47.911 --> 08:50.379
He said to stall them until he gets here.

08:52.249 --> 08:56.948
- God, don't let him kill me.
- We want the goddamn car, right now.

09:02.693 --> 09:06.094
<i>All right. But you don't get anything
till I come in and talk.</i>

09:06.163 --> 09:09.189
All right, you bastard,
lay your piece on the hood of that car.

09:15.539 --> 09:17.939
What about me? I'm your partner.

09:18.008 --> 09:22.035
<i>I may have to move fast and I don't need
too much linguini to hold me back.</i>

09:22.112 --> 09:24.343
You got a lot of class, Harry.

09:51.810 --> 09:55.871
You get cute,
I blow this nice lady all over you. Let's go.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.288
On the floor, motherfucker.

10:05.356 --> 10:08.086
For God's sakes, mister, do like he says!

10:08.827 --> 10:10.419
This is my best sports jacket.

10:10.495 --> 10:13.362
I said, get your ass on the floor,
you dirty son of a bitch!

10:13.431 --> 10:15.331
Spread eagle. Move it!

10:16.534 --> 10:18.502
Get down there.

10:21.907 --> 10:24.068
San Francisco's finest.

10:26.946 --> 10:28.743
Mitch.

10:31.617 --> 10:32.914
Roll him over.

10:37.423 --> 10:38.788
He's clean.

10:40.459 --> 10:42.086
Here's the story.

10:44.196 --> 10:47.632
First, we want all the pigs out of here.

10:48.167 --> 10:51.432
Second, we want a car...

10:52.304 --> 10:53.931
...with a police radio.

10:54.707 --> 10:56.868
Deliver it right out there in front.

10:56.942 --> 10:58.842
We're taking two hostages:

11:00.279 --> 11:01.940
Both the women.

11:02.281 --> 11:06.547
If you don't do exactly what I tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off!

11:07.520 --> 11:10.318
- You got the picture?
- Yeah.

11:11.056 --> 11:13.024
What are you waiting for?

11:21.334 --> 11:23.894
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

11:35.615 --> 11:38.175
- What do they want?
- They want a car.

11:40.987 --> 11:42.682
What are you going to do?

11:43.890 --> 11:45.357
Give them one.

12:03.210 --> 12:04.939
You son of a bitch!

12:40.882 --> 12:43.976
Tell me, what makes a man
crazy enough to join the cops?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.879
If you find out, you let me know, huh?

12:51.425 --> 12:55.361
$14,379.

12:56.731 --> 12:59.666
- How can that be?
- You want an itemized account?

12:59.734 --> 13:03.761
You took out two front doors,
one front window, 12 feet of counter.

13:03.871 --> 13:08.535
Plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

13:08.709 --> 13:13.511
As well as three hostages in the hospital,
all of whom will probably sue the city.

13:13.649 --> 13:15.947
- For what?
- Excessive use of force.

13:16.018 --> 13:17.952
For your information, Callahan...

13:18.020 --> 13:21.786
...the minority community has just about
had it with this kind of police work.

13:21.857 --> 13:24.849
<i>By the ''minority community,''
you're talking about the hoods?</i>

13:24.927 --> 13:27.862
It so happens that they are
American citizens, too.

13:27.963 --> 13:30.329
What about the lady with the shotgun
in her ear?

13:30.399 --> 13:32.367
I'm not going to debate this with you.

13:32.434 --> 13:35.096
I've been on the phone
to the Mayor twice this morning.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.468
He went right through the ceiling over this.

13:37.539 --> 13:39.404
Did you tell him about the meeting?

13:39.474 --> 13:42.443
- What meeting?
- The meeting right here, two months ago...

13:42.511 --> 13:45.639
<i>...when you said high priority was:
''Run these hoods out of here.''</i>

13:45.714 --> 13:47.272
I never said to use violence.

13:47.349 --> 13:49.715
<i>What should I do,
yell ''trick-or-treat'' at them?</i>

13:49.785 --> 13:50.945
Come on, Harry.

13:51.019 --> 13:53.920
I expect you,
and every other man on this force...

13:53.989 --> 13:57.447
...to behave with restraint
or turn in his resignation.

13:58.126 --> 13:59.957
You're on notice, Callahan.

14:00.028 --> 14:03.589
This little show of yours yesterday
is exactly the kind of thing...

14:03.665 --> 14:06.600
...this department
is no longer prepared to tolerate!

14:06.868 --> 14:08.359
Is that clear?

14:09.605 --> 14:10.867
Yes, sir.

14:13.409 --> 14:16.970
- If that's all, Captain, I've got work to do.
- But not in Homicide.

14:19.549 --> 14:20.777
What?

14:21.284 --> 14:23.479
You've been transferred to Personnel.

14:24.153 --> 14:25.381
To Personnel?

14:25.455 --> 14:27.252
That's for assholes.

14:31.928 --> 14:34.897
I was in Personnel for 10 years.

14:36.599 --> 14:37.793
Yeah.

14:39.068 --> 14:40.126
That's it.

14:40.203 --> 14:44.196
You report tomorrow to the Oral
Examining Board. 9:00, on the dot.

14:48.878 --> 14:51.039
No, you haven't got the picture.

14:51.714 --> 14:54.774
I'm the robber, you're the cop.

14:55.952 --> 14:57.647
Now, I'm in a market, see?

14:57.720 --> 15:00.951
And you've just caught me, dead bang.
A 211 in the act.

15:01.024 --> 15:03.185
But I'm coming out, and I've got a hostage.

15:03.259 --> 15:05.694
A kid with a gun at his head.

15:05.763 --> 15:07.993
There's no way you're gonna take me alive.

15:08.065 --> 15:10.761
<i>You've 10 seconds to make up your mind,
''Here I come.''</i>

15:10.834 --> 15:12.199
What are you gonna do?

15:12.269 --> 15:13.395
One...

15:13.470 --> 15:15.631
...two, three...
- You're under arrest.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.266
...four, five...
- Do something!

15:18.342 --> 15:20.242
<i>...six, seven...
- How tall is he?</i>

15:20.310 --> 15:22.744
Don't just stand there, goddamn it,
do something!

15:22.813 --> 15:24.576
Bang, you're dead.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.249
- You're late, Callahan.
- Sorry about that.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.047
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.785
All right, Bustanoby,
you'll be notified of your grade.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.322
You were told to be here at 9:00.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.862
We have 50 officers out there to test.

15:40.164 --> 15:42.462
- For how many vacancies?
- Eight.

15:42.699 --> 15:47.136
There will be five men and three women
promoted to inspector out of this group.

15:47.204 --> 15:49.900
- Three women?
- Do you object, Inspector?

15:51.542 --> 15:53.339
Now, who might you be?

15:53.610 --> 15:56.170
This is Mrs. Grey of the Mayor's staff.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.373
She's here to monitor these examinations.

15:58.449 --> 15:59.916
This is Inspector Callahan.

15:59.983 --> 16:02.452
Yes, I know something
of Inspector Callahan.

16:03.154 --> 16:05.213
And I'd like to tell you...

16:05.290 --> 16:09.124
...it's the Mayor's plan that the department
be brought more into line with...

16:09.194 --> 16:12.721
...the mainstream of 20th century thought.

16:14.732 --> 16:17.792
How does he figure to do that?

16:20.271 --> 16:21.932
For one thing...

16:22.006 --> 16:23.439
...his Honor intends...

16:23.541 --> 16:27.534
...to broaden the areas of participation
for women in the police force.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.678
Well, that sounds very stylish.

16:32.050 --> 16:35.213
I think he also said something about:

16:35.453 --> 16:38.980
<i>''Winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.''</i>

16:44.028 --> 16:47.088
Well, I guess we better get on with it.
Next applicant.

16:50.735 --> 16:52.999
- Officer Moore?
- Yes, sir.

16:53.071 --> 16:56.063
As you know, this is the final stage
in your examination.

16:56.141 --> 17:00.909
It's an informal test to try and get an idea
of your ability to think on your feet.

17:00.980 --> 17:03.574
Your reaction to stress and pressure.

17:03.849 --> 17:08.183
Your ability to apply the law
in a hypothetical situation and so on, okay?

17:08.487 --> 17:09.749
Yes, sir.

17:10.522 --> 17:12.387
How long have you been on the force?

17:12.458 --> 17:14.323
- Nine years.
- What department?

17:15.394 --> 17:17.362
Mainly Personnel and Records.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.694
- Personnel and Records?
- Yes, sir.

17:27.473 --> 17:30.203
Have you any questions for the applicant?

17:33.779 --> 17:37.078
Questions? How fast do you run the 100?

17:37.349 --> 17:40.716
Come on, Callahan,
you know how this board functions.

17:44.557 --> 17:46.354
All right, I'm sorry.

17:49.195 --> 17:51.026
You know that...

17:52.198 --> 17:55.600
...if you make inspector
under the Mayor's new guidelines...

17:56.002 --> 17:59.403
...you might just be out riding
in a police car?

17:59.539 --> 18:01.803
Yes, sir, that's what I'm hoping for.

18:02.075 --> 18:04.043
Officer Moore, maybe you'll tell us...

18:04.110 --> 18:06.544
...about your most important felony arrest.

18:08.582 --> 18:10.914
I've never made a felony arrest.

18:13.420 --> 18:17.117
Well, maybe you'll tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest, then.

18:18.024 --> 18:20.925
I've never made
a misdemeanor arrest either.

18:21.094 --> 18:24.188
Then what the hell gives you the right
to become an inspector...

18:24.264 --> 18:27.062
...when some men have been
on the street for 10 or 15 years?

18:27.133 --> 18:30.534
<i>''The woman's place is in the home.''
Is that what you're trying to say?</i>

18:30.604 --> 18:32.663
Do you think this is an encounter group?

18:32.739 --> 18:35.936
I want to know what she'll do
when someone points a gun at her...

18:36.009 --> 18:37.499
<i>...and says, ''Hit the deck! ''</i>

18:37.577 --> 18:40.910
You're just deliberately trying
to fail this candidate, aren't you?

18:40.981 --> 18:43.950
Well, if she fails out there,
she gets her ass blown off.

18:44.017 --> 18:45.917
It's my ass!

18:47.687 --> 18:49.882
And my hard luck.

18:50.323 --> 18:52.656
Except, out there you'll have a partner.

18:52.727 --> 18:55.195
If you get blown away,
he gets blown away with you.

18:55.263 --> 18:58.562
And that's a hell of a price to pay
for being stylish.

19:04.805 --> 19:07.569
Are you finished with the questioning?

19:10.411 --> 19:12.538
Hypothetical situation, huh?

19:15.082 --> 19:16.947
I'm standing on the street corner...

19:17.018 --> 19:19.748
...and Mrs. Grey there comes up
and propositions me.

19:19.820 --> 19:23.187
She says, if I come home with her for $5,
she'll put on a show...

19:23.257 --> 19:27.250
<i>...with a Shetland pony.
- If this is your idea of humor, Inspector...</i>

19:30.698 --> 19:33.565
All right, what are you trying
to do here, Callahan?

19:33.634 --> 19:37.297
I'm trying to find out if anybody here
knows what law is being broken...

19:37.371 --> 19:39.339
...besides cruelty to animals.

19:39.774 --> 19:42.572
That's a conspiracy,
under Title 7, Section 182...

19:42.643 --> 19:45.111
...Paragraph 1
of the California State Penal Code.

19:45.179 --> 19:47.647
A conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor
is a felony...

19:47.715 --> 19:51.618
...and according to People vs. Bashor in...
- Yes, that's right, good answer.

19:51.687 --> 19:54.986
Thank you, Officer Moore,
you'll be notified of your grade.

20:17.179 --> 20:19.773
After I take care of the guard
and get his keys...

20:19.848 --> 20:23.045
...we drive to the far end
of warehouse 50A. Lalo?

20:24.820 --> 20:26.845
<i>All right, now that's...</i>

20:26.988 --> 20:30.549
I drop you off at that end,
at that small door, then I drive around...

20:30.625 --> 20:34.186
...to the wharf side of the warehouse.
You open up that first big door...

20:34.763 --> 20:38.563
...I drive it in and back up
to the first compound on the right.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.061
Karl and Tex?

20:40.135 --> 20:43.195
Hey, man,
we grab the M-16 automatic rifles, right?

20:43.271 --> 20:44.431
Wanda?

20:45.340 --> 20:47.809
Locate and take any explosives.

20:48.144 --> 20:50.806
Dynamite, detonators, and any plastics.

20:51.381 --> 20:52.814
Right. Henry Lee?

20:53.015 --> 20:56.849
I tote and I load all the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

20:57.053 --> 20:58.145
Miki?

20:58.221 --> 21:02.089
Locate the Law rockets. They should be
somewhere in the back of the compound.

21:02.158 --> 21:05.685
That's the most important item.
Tex, are you sure of their location?

21:05.762 --> 21:08.492
Hey, I sweated in that place for five years.

21:08.564 --> 21:10.555
They're there, I promise.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.797
All right, you guys.

21:12.902 --> 21:15.962
<i>- This is for the people.
- Right on, ''for the people.''</i>

21:16.239 --> 21:19.367
Jesus, spare me.

21:55.446 --> 21:57.346
- What is it?
- Gas Company.

21:57.414 --> 22:00.008
- What's the trouble?
- We've a gas leak in the area.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.244
We got to check out
your underground pipes.

22:02.319 --> 22:05.152
For pete's sake,
don't smoke until we tell you it's okay.

22:05.222 --> 22:07.019
I won't.

22:15.999 --> 22:20.493
It's seeping down into your sewer system.
This whole damn block could go!

22:20.571 --> 22:23.506
- You got a phone I could use?
- Yeah, right this way.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.525
Let's go.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.703
Charlie left the gate open.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.574
Better check it.

24:33.006 --> 24:34.633
Tony, call a backup.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.443
- I'm going to check around.
- Frank, watch yourself.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.354
Law's rocket!

24:58.898 --> 25:02.061
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

25:03.903 --> 25:07.031
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

25:15.415 --> 25:18.384
You'll blow us out of here.
Be quiet. Are you all right?

25:19.252 --> 25:21.311
Let us get these.

25:25.659 --> 25:27.251
Freeze.

25:44.645 --> 25:47.910
All of you, hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

25:51.185 --> 25:54.154
You, back there,
stand up where I can see you.

25:54.221 --> 25:58.453
And drop that gun.
Put your hands over your head and freeze!

26:05.032 --> 26:08.399
- Now, just wait a second, mister.
- Now you shut up and listen.

26:08.502 --> 26:12.836
You just blink an eyelid
and I'll mail you home to Mama in a box.

26:13.074 --> 26:15.201
Now, all of you, against the fence!

26:15.910 --> 26:17.377
Now!

26:23.918 --> 26:25.351
You, too, honey!

26:28.623 --> 26:31.888
Oh, Jesus!

26:32.360 --> 26:35.659
Oh, my God. Jesus!

26:37.532 --> 26:40.797
Oh, baby, it's all right,
I'll get you out. I'll get you home.

26:40.869 --> 26:42.734
Bobby, help me. Help me get her up.

26:42.804 --> 26:45.796
- You're going to get us caught.
- No, we'll make it.

26:45.874 --> 26:48.172
- She's dead.
- She's not dead!

26:48.243 --> 26:49.972
The hell she isn't!

26:53.315 --> 26:56.478
Come on, it's over.

27:15.904 --> 27:17.963
Get it on there.

27:19.941 --> 27:22.774
Lalo, get up in there. Come on.

27:43.666 --> 27:47.625
Halt, police! Halt or I'll fire!

27:50.239 --> 27:52.366
I'm gonna get this son of a bitch.

27:52.575 --> 27:53.940
Goddamn it!

28:03.686 --> 28:06.883
Well, he said it looked like
a regular Gas Company truck.

28:07.924 --> 28:10.654
I'm checking with the Marin County
Sheriff's Department.

28:10.726 --> 28:14.560
Might tie in with those two bodies
they found up there last week.

28:17.934 --> 28:19.162
Yes, sir.

28:19.769 --> 28:21.362
How's DiGeorgio?

28:21.605 --> 28:23.903
Well, Irene is in there with him now.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.532
Is that supposed to be
some kind of answer?

28:27.044 --> 28:29.569
Harry, he's just been given the last rites.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.871
- Get what you can, huh?
- I will.

28:31.949 --> 28:33.814
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- I know.

28:39.590 --> 28:41.057
Hello, Harry.

28:41.525 --> 28:43.254
He's been asking for you.

28:43.493 --> 28:44.824
How is he?

28:45.395 --> 28:46.987
He's in and out.

28:53.570 --> 28:55.470
I'll smoke a cigarette.

28:58.308 --> 29:00.105
It's a war, isn't it?

29:01.712 --> 29:04.340
I guess I never really understood that.

29:18.963 --> 29:21.864
Frank, what happened?

29:22.500 --> 29:25.435
<i>I had them dead bang. And then I...</i>

29:32.343 --> 29:33.605
Sorry.

29:39.717 --> 29:42.208
There's something
you wanted to tell Harry.

29:42.921 --> 29:46.948
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

29:47.959 --> 29:49.586
...l've seen him before.

29:50.028 --> 29:51.188
Where?

29:52.096 --> 29:54.189
I just can't make the name.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.700
Well, where do you know him from, Frank?

29:58.036 --> 29:59.867
That homicide, remember?

30:00.505 --> 30:01.972
The old hooker...

30:02.040 --> 30:03.871
...up on Filmore district.

30:04.008 --> 30:05.976
The summer of '71?

30:07.312 --> 30:08.404
What about it?

30:08.479 --> 30:11.812
Well, he was one of the pimps
we questioned.

30:12.050 --> 30:14.019
We liked him for it, Harry.

30:15.487 --> 30:17.682
We liked him real good.

30:17.890 --> 30:21.417
As I recall, we liked everybody
north of Market Street on that one.

30:21.493 --> 30:26.487
He had one of those cutesy-pie
little boy names:

30:27.399 --> 30:30.459
Charlie or something, or Bobby.

30:31.603 --> 30:34.697
I'll check Records,
they should have your notes.

30:37.843 --> 30:39.834
Ten-to-one they blow it.

30:40.212 --> 30:42.180
Not this time, Frank.

30:46.151 --> 30:48.312
Maybe you better get some rest, huh?

30:48.654 --> 30:50.588
Do you have to go just yet?

30:50.789 --> 30:52.916
Not if you don't want me to.

30:53.359 --> 30:54.917
Thanks, Harry.

31:03.168 --> 31:04.601
Get Irene.

31:12.746 --> 31:15.977
- Did you talk to Records?
- No, not yet. That was McKay.

31:16.783 --> 31:21.117
We just got a tape from those bastards.
I'll see you in my office in 30 minutes.

31:25.392 --> 31:27.223
Code Blue, intensive care.

31:29.496 --> 31:30.827
Thirty minutes.

31:31.698 --> 31:34.599
<i>We want $1 million
or we start blowing things up.</i>

31:34.667 --> 31:37.067
<i>The People's Revolutionary Strike Force.</i>

31:37.203 --> 31:38.966
<i>Remember Fessenheim.</i>

31:39.939 --> 31:41.201
Fessenheim?

31:41.741 --> 31:43.140
It's being checked.

31:43.209 --> 31:46.235
This Revolutionary Strike Force,
are they on your list?

31:49.516 --> 31:51.040
Nothing.

31:51.217 --> 31:53.708
- Think it's legitimate?
- Probably not.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.113
This is Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

31:58.758 --> 32:02.216
Well, what are you doing
about those records? What's happening?

32:02.495 --> 32:04.292
<i>What do you mean, ''what records''?</i>

32:04.364 --> 32:06.993
I talked to you about them
half an hour ago.

32:07.134 --> 32:11.935
Homicide. Filmore district.
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

32:14.542 --> 32:17.170
What are you talking about,
a written request?

32:17.378 --> 32:19.403
Well, who's got the keys?

32:19.847 --> 32:22.714
Look. I'm coming down there
in five minutes...

32:22.783 --> 32:27.345
...and you better have those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

32:30.191 --> 32:31.624
You don't have to make threats.

32:31.859 --> 32:33.884
I'm telling you, I'm going to nail the guy...

32:33.961 --> 32:36.862
...who carved DiGeorgio
if I have to do it on my own time.

32:36.931 --> 32:38.330
That won't be necessary.

32:38.399 --> 32:41.994
You've been back in Homicide
since 9:00 this morning, didn't you know?

32:43.471 --> 32:46.872
No. I've been down in Records
looking up an old homicide.

32:46.941 --> 32:48.101
Any luck?

32:48.175 --> 32:51.406
Well, I've got 11 names here
of known pimps.

32:52.346 --> 32:56.339
- I think our man is one of them.
- Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.781
Shall I tell you my instinct on this?

32:59.854 --> 33:02.914
- Black militants.
- No, it keeps coming up hookers.

33:02.990 --> 33:05.755
The girl who was shot in the warehouse
is Miki Waleska.

33:05.827 --> 33:07.522
She was a known prostitute.

33:07.596 --> 33:11.498
What we've got here is
a well-organized group of militants...

33:11.566 --> 33:15.400
...with enough explosives to blow half
of San Francisco away, including...

33:15.470 --> 33:17.404
...Law's rockets!

33:17.472 --> 33:18.700
- Law's rockets?
- Yeah.

33:18.773 --> 33:21.606
The Army's giving us a demonstration
at the firing range...

33:21.676 --> 33:23.667
...in exactly 35 minutes.

33:23.745 --> 33:26.407
I'd like everyone connected
with the case to be there.

33:26.481 --> 33:28.642
I want you to know what you're up against.

33:28.717 --> 33:32.619
I've too much to do. Besides, I've already
been checked out on a Law's rocket.

33:32.687 --> 33:34.018
Your partner hasn't.

33:35.423 --> 33:36.549
My partner?

33:44.132 --> 33:45.861
Shit!

33:46.301 --> 33:48.394
You know Inspector Moore?

33:50.438 --> 33:51.769
Inspector.

33:52.474 --> 33:54.965
I'll see you both out at the firing range.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.977
Inspector?

34:02.151 --> 34:06.679
Listen, Inspector, I realize that you are not
particularly happy by this assignment.

34:06.756 --> 34:10.021
- You don't think I'm up to it, do you?
- Right.

34:10.826 --> 34:12.157
All right...

34:12.228 --> 34:15.857
...I would like to get one thing straight,
and that is the fact I'm a woman.

34:15.931 --> 34:18.628
I consider that fact absolutely irrelevant
from now on...

34:18.701 --> 34:22.467
...because I will not accept,
nor do I expect, any special consideration.

34:22.672 --> 34:24.071
Marvelous.

34:24.873 --> 34:27.866
The Law's rocket,
for all intents and purposes...

34:28.177 --> 34:31.010
...a one-shot, throwaway,
disposable bazooka.

34:32.915 --> 34:35.382
It is a fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

34:35.451 --> 34:38.614
...3 inches in diameter,
which fires a single projectile...

34:38.688 --> 34:43.125
<i>...designed to penetrate armor plating
up to the thickness 3/4 of an inch.</i>

34:43.326 --> 34:47.387
If you've all had a good look at the rocket,
I'll demonstrate how it works.

34:48.063 --> 34:51.033
To fire the rocket, you first pull this pin...

34:51.367 --> 34:53.266
...dropping the rear cover...

34:53.636 --> 34:55.467
...then pull.

34:55.771 --> 34:58.172
<i>Your front sight,
your rear sight spring up...</i>

34:58.242 --> 35:00.540
I got word from Pathology...

35:00.611 --> 35:04.047
...at noon they're posting that guard
that was killed last night.

35:04.114 --> 35:06.412
- Check on it.
- I'll be there.

35:07.251 --> 35:08.275
Captain?

35:08.552 --> 35:09.814
Go ahead.

35:09.953 --> 35:12.786
Gentlemen, if you'll keep your eyes
on that half-track...

35:12.856 --> 35:16.053
...l'll demonstrate how effective
this weapon can be.

35:35.979 --> 35:38.914
Coming, Inspector?

36:11.716 --> 36:13.377
- Inspector?
- Yeah?

36:13.484 --> 36:15.952
- 13.5 in my gym shorts.
- What?

36:16.287 --> 36:19.518
My time in the 100.
You asked me at the Orals Board.

36:19.691 --> 36:22.125
- You think I was picking on you?
- Yes.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.655
It was nothing personal.

36:24.762 --> 36:25.751
Right.

36:25.930 --> 36:28.763
I don't think you know
what we do for a living in Homicide.

36:28.833 --> 36:29.822
I'll find out.

36:29.901 --> 36:32.028
I hope you don't find out the hard way.

36:32.103 --> 36:34.264
How fast do you run the 100, Inspector?

36:34.339 --> 36:35.772
Beats me.

36:36.374 --> 36:39.138
I meant to tell you how sorry I am
about your partner.

36:39.210 --> 36:40.973
He's not the first one I've lost.

36:41.045 --> 36:45.641
I know, Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

36:45.850 --> 36:48.478
- How'd you know that?
- I checked on your records.

36:48.853 --> 36:51.186
I don't want to get killed
anymore than you do.

36:51.256 --> 36:52.518
What's the matter?

36:52.691 --> 36:55.558
The Black guy with the briefcase.
I know him from somewhere.

36:55.627 --> 36:57.117
- Tan suit?
- Yeah.

36:58.230 --> 37:00.027
What did he do?

37:00.466 --> 37:03.026
Can't remember. It's not important.

37:05.871 --> 37:08.601
- Tell me, ever been to one of these before?
- No.

37:09.208 --> 37:12.336
In that case,
I'd like to suggest that you sit out here.

37:12.845 --> 37:15.643
Please don't concern yourself, Inspector.

37:21.253 --> 37:22.618
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi.

37:22.688 --> 37:24.553
Who's the pretty lady?

37:24.923 --> 37:27.221
That's my partner, Inspector Moore.

37:27.693 --> 37:29.251
You've missed most of it.

37:29.328 --> 37:31.159
We got hung up on a firing range.

37:31.230 --> 37:34.859
I've got it on tape for you.
We've just finished the abdominal cavity.

37:34.933 --> 37:36.696
I'm interested in the wound.

37:36.769 --> 37:39.966
The entry wound
was above the right renal area...

37:40.038 --> 37:43.633
...between the ninth and tenth rib,
penetrating up into the chest cavity...

37:43.709 --> 37:45.472
...perforating the right lung.

37:45.544 --> 37:48.708
There was also damage
to some of the other vital organs...

37:48.782 --> 37:50.909
...pancreas, kidneys, etcetera.

37:51.484 --> 37:54.317
- What kind of a knife was it?
- A long heavy blade.

37:54.954 --> 37:56.945
We're going into the skull now.

37:58.591 --> 38:02.152
I'd say, an educated guess,
it was one of those killing knives:

38:02.228 --> 38:05.664
A Marine Corps Boy,
or one of those Special Forces' Randalls.

38:05.899 --> 38:07.366
Any bruises about the face?

38:07.434 --> 38:11.200
Indications that the killer clamped
his left hand over the mouth, from behind.

38:11.271 --> 38:12.966
- Professional?
- Textbook.

38:14.774 --> 38:18.141
On first examination,
no exterior damage to the skull.

38:56.083 --> 39:00.713
<i>Subject brain shows no contrecoup- type
damage or blood clotting.</i>

39:01.055 --> 39:03.819
Jesus H. Christ, Harry,
come here and look at this!

39:03.891 --> 39:07.088
- It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- What's that?

39:07.261 --> 39:09.593
<i>What it says: ''Eat at Luigi's! ''</i>

39:26.447 --> 39:28.210
Welcome to Homicide.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.992
What are you doing? Come here.

39:52.908 --> 39:54.603
Excuse me, I'm with him.

39:57.345 --> 40:01.611
I was coming down the hall to take a leak
when this whole thing blew.

40:02.050 --> 40:03.677
Anybody in there?

40:05.687 --> 40:08.315
- No, I don't think so.
- Where are you going?

40:08.390 --> 40:10.654
I got a group of kids,
some of them are missing.

40:10.759 --> 40:12.784
- Help him out.
- Me?

40:12.894 --> 40:15.556
Great. Just step out here, will you?

40:15.730 --> 40:17.960
Well, we were lucky this time.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.800
It's getting so that you can't even go
to the can in peace.

40:27.609 --> 40:29.941
- We've got them all, they're okay.
- Good.

40:31.446 --> 40:34.643
You didn't see anybody go in there
before the explosion, did you?

40:34.716 --> 40:35.478
No.

40:35.550 --> 40:39.009
You sure? Black guy with a tan hat
and suit, briefcase.

40:39.922 --> 40:41.412
I did see a guy like that.

40:41.490 --> 40:43.355
Was he a short guy, about 5-foot-1?

40:43.426 --> 40:45.417
No, this dude was 6 foot.

40:45.528 --> 40:46.893
That's him.

40:51.701 --> 40:53.760
It was a bomb, I think I saw who did it.

40:53.836 --> 40:55.804
- Any idea who it was?
- He looked familiar...

40:55.871 --> 40:57.463
- Inspector?
- Just a minute.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.103
- You better check the mug shots.
- Inspector?

41:00.176 --> 41:03.543
Honey, do you mind, we're talking.
This is very important.

41:03.613 --> 41:06.980
Now, you better check the mug shots,
we just got another message.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.880
They're asking for $2 million now.

41:08.951 --> 41:10.441
- $2 million?
- I just saw him.

41:10.519 --> 41:13.215
- Who?
- Tan suit and a hat and a briefcase.

41:14.123 --> 41:16.353
- Where?
- Right down here.

41:16.425 --> 41:19.986
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- Why the hell didn't you ask me?

41:31.440 --> 41:33.101
There he is, look!

43:50.115 --> 43:51.104
Jesus!

44:31.090 --> 44:32.216
Damn it.

45:12.732 --> 45:14.666
What the hell's going on here?

45:17.303 --> 45:18.998
What are you doing here?

45:30.451 --> 45:32.919
- Who are you?
- Police officer.

46:25.307 --> 46:27.468
All right, speedy, you're under arrest.

46:27.542 --> 46:30.534
In the name of God, man, this is a church.
What are you doing?

46:30.612 --> 46:32.944
I'm a police officer, this man's under arrest.

46:33.014 --> 46:36.472
Father, help me, I wasn't doing a thing.
This guy is just rousting me.

46:36.551 --> 46:39.714
Would it be asking too much
to see some credentials, Officer?

46:39.788 --> 46:42.621
This guy runs like a rabbit.
I'm not about to let him go.

46:42.691 --> 46:45.182
I'd like to see the credentials, right now.

46:45.860 --> 46:47.122
If you insist.

46:51.933 --> 46:54.925
- Callahan, Inspector.
- Well, Callahan...

46:56.338 --> 46:59.136
...I think you're a disgrace to this city.

46:59.207 --> 47:01.300
Okay. Nobody move!

47:10.185 --> 47:11.516
Marvelous.

47:13.455 --> 47:14.581
Yes, I think so.

47:14.656 --> 47:16.852
Harry, wait a minute, I'm just talking to...

47:16.926 --> 47:18.393
Jesus Christ!

47:19.061 --> 47:20.358
Give him my best.

47:20.429 --> 47:21.862
I'll call you back.

47:21.998 --> 47:24.558
Don't worry,
it's been disarmed by the bomb squad.

47:24.633 --> 47:28.467
But it's definitely the explosive
out of the Hamilton Firearms works.

47:29.071 --> 47:32.097
There are times when I can only stand you
as a human being.

47:32.842 --> 47:34.503
What about the punk?

47:34.877 --> 47:37.345
- You mean the suspect.
- Suspect, my ass.

47:37.413 --> 47:39.938
He isn't talking,
but we've got a make on him.

47:40.016 --> 47:41.677
His name is Henry Lee Caldwell.

47:41.751 --> 47:44.948
And he is a member
of a Black militant group called Uhuru.

47:45.955 --> 47:48.321
- Pusseau, shelve that.
- Uhuru?

47:49.125 --> 47:52.026
It's run by a guy called Big Ed Mustapha.

47:52.094 --> 47:55.291
Mustapha, down the Mission district.

47:55.364 --> 47:57.332
I thought that guy looked familiar.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.697
Where's my partner?

47:58.768 --> 48:00.736
She's in the can.

48:00.836 --> 48:03.202
She's been in there
ever since she found out...

48:03.272 --> 48:07.106
...that she was packing this thing,
in that briefcase, all over San Francisco.

48:07.176 --> 48:09.508
Harry, do me a favor. Go easy on her, huh?

48:09.578 --> 48:12.742
It's her first day
and it's been a damn long one.

48:13.450 --> 48:17.784
If she wants to play lumberjack, she's got
to learn to handle her end of the log.

48:37.474 --> 48:39.374
Okay, I give up, what's this?

48:39.576 --> 48:43.342
This is the Filmore chapter
of the VFW: Very Few Whites.

48:43.980 --> 48:47.711
I don't suppose it would do any good
to suggest you wait in the car?

48:47.784 --> 48:49.911
Don't concern yourself, Inspector.

48:55.158 --> 48:58.525
Well, if it ain't the mighty whitey
and friend.

48:59.629 --> 49:01.961
I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

49:02.299 --> 49:06.030
Sorry, honkie, she can stay,
but you've got to go.

49:06.503 --> 49:10.463
Yeah, baby, we're trying to keep up
the standards, you understand.

49:10.641 --> 49:13.508
- You're not making us feel too welcome.
- You're welcome.

49:13.578 --> 49:16.547
You're about as welcome as a turd
in a swimming pool.

49:27.258 --> 49:29.954
Well, lookie here, if it ain't the fuzz.

49:30.161 --> 49:31.924
I'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

49:31.996 --> 49:36.330
- You hold some kind of warrant, honkie?
- What I'm holding is Henry Lee Caldwell.

49:37.001 --> 49:38.593
I've never heard of him.

49:38.669 --> 49:42.901
Let's see how fast you and the lady fuzz
can get your white asses out of here.

49:43.774 --> 49:45.571
What is Henry Lee into now?

49:50.681 --> 49:53.673
He's been playing with dynamite.
Are you Mustapha?

49:54.252 --> 49:56.083
Yeah, that's right.

49:56.888 --> 49:59.413
Why don't you just come
into my office here.

50:01.459 --> 50:02.756
Just you.

50:04.328 --> 50:07.196
Don't worry, pig,
we'll see she don't get lonesome.

50:10.469 --> 50:12.562
Well, that's mighty white of you.

50:15.474 --> 50:18.341
Now, gentlemen, before anybody
does anything uncalled for...

50:18.410 --> 50:21.811
...l'd like to take this chance
to point out I am a police officer...

50:21.914 --> 50:24.974
<i>...and if you touch me
with intent to do bodily harm...</i>

50:31.089 --> 50:32.488
Sit down, Callahan.

50:33.025 --> 50:34.754
Where do I know you from?

50:38.463 --> 50:39.555
You don't.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.799
I just know you.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.841
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

50:52.144 --> 50:53.873
You telling me you don't know?

50:53.946 --> 50:57.677
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

50:58.050 --> 50:59.449
Where is he?

51:00.485 --> 51:04.115
He went white.
Why, did he do something else foolish?

51:06.025 --> 51:10.291
He and his friends were involved
in a ripoff at the Hamilton Firearms.

51:10.396 --> 51:12.193
I heard about that.

51:13.166 --> 51:14.997
Would you like to buy into that?

51:15.068 --> 51:17.536
Four counts of murder, aiding and abetting.

51:17.604 --> 51:22.041
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

51:22.208 --> 51:23.766
What do you deal in?

51:23.843 --> 51:25.071
Waiting.

51:25.678 --> 51:26.940
For what?

51:29.649 --> 51:31.879
Waiting for all you white honkies...

51:31.951 --> 51:35.546
...to blow each other up
so we can move right on in.

51:38.625 --> 51:41.059
Tell me about Henry Lee
and these friends of his.

51:41.127 --> 51:45.188
Some paddy-dudes he met in Vietnam.
Why?

51:47.734 --> 51:50.225
Anybody on this list here grab you?

51:50.770 --> 51:53.671
Hey, man, why should I want to help you?

51:54.741 --> 51:58.074
If you don't, I have to talk to Robbery.
They might be interested...

51:58.144 --> 52:00.079
...in these elaborate furnishings.

52:00.714 --> 52:02.511
What are you talking about?

52:04.551 --> 52:06.382
Room 401, Fairmont.

52:08.222 --> 52:10.053
<i>''Rest easy at the Holiday Inn.''</i>

52:10.958 --> 52:12.755
Okay, so?

52:13.527 --> 52:15.461
Maybe they're a little warm.

52:15.863 --> 52:17.262
I'll tell you what:

52:18.098 --> 52:21.431
One of my boys got busted
on a possession charge.

52:21.635 --> 52:25.469
Now, you get him off and forget about
my interior decorator...

52:25.873 --> 52:28.103
...and I'll see what I can do.

52:28.275 --> 52:29.572
That's asking a lot.

52:29.548 --> 52:30.845
You want a lot.

52:32.751 --> 52:35.652
A thing like this can ruin my image.

52:39.425 --> 52:41.017
I'll see what I can do.

52:41.994 --> 52:43.757
What about the list?

52:52.805 --> 52:54.033
Bobby Maxwell.

52:57.611 --> 52:59.010
He's the main man.

52:59.412 --> 53:00.674
You know him?

53:01.114 --> 53:03.173
Stone waste of white.

53:03.450 --> 53:04.974
Where can I find him?

53:06.753 --> 53:08.414
I'll check around.

53:09.956 --> 53:13.187
You do that. Much obliged.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.989
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

53:17.530 --> 53:19.157
How do you figure that?

53:19.466 --> 53:21.457
You go and put your ass on the line...

53:21.534 --> 53:25.368
...for a bunch of dudes who wouldn't even
let you in the front door anymore...

53:26.439 --> 53:28.031
...than they would me.

53:28.108 --> 53:30.474
- I'm not doing it for them.
- Who, then?

53:34.381 --> 53:36.679
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

53:40.654 --> 53:44.317
- If it becomes necessary to pull this piece...
- Having fun, Inspector?

53:44.391 --> 53:47.360
If you're through socializing,
we do have work to do.

53:48.461 --> 53:50.088
Son of a bitch.

53:53.734 --> 53:57.465
If you have some sort of objection
to the way I handled myself...

53:57.538 --> 53:59.267
...I wish you'd just say so.

54:00.074 --> 54:02.099
I thought I was doing all right.

54:09.116 --> 54:10.515
Marvelous.

55:04.206 --> 55:06.367
<i>All right, Mustapha...</i>

55:07.275 --> 55:10.938
<i>... this is Captain McKay
of the San Francisco Police Department.</i>

55:12.247 --> 55:16.411
<i>I'm ordering you to throw down
your weapons and come out peacefully.</i>

55:23.291 --> 55:25.384
<i>You are totally surrounded.</i>

55:26.328 --> 55:28.125
<i>Mustapha, do you hear me?</i>

55:29.231 --> 55:31.961
<i>Come out with your hands
raised over your heads.</i>

56:06.169 --> 56:08.569
I don't want to seem ungrateful,
Your Honor...

56:08.638 --> 56:11.232
...I just feel that it might be a better idea.

56:11.307 --> 56:14.105
Well, I'm still a little confused.

56:15.011 --> 56:17.605
Now, you and the SWAT team
made the arrest...

56:17.680 --> 56:20.945
...but you want the credit to go
to Inspectors Moore and Callahan?

56:21.017 --> 56:23.815
Your Honor,
I just felt it might be a better tactic...

56:23.886 --> 56:27.083
...politically,
what with the election coming up soon.

56:27.223 --> 56:31.387
To show how your new guidelines
for women in the police have worked.

56:31.494 --> 56:34.895
Sort of an I-told-you-so situation,
if you know what I mean, sir.

56:34.964 --> 56:39.458
Yes, I see. It's an excellent idea.
What do you think, Jimmy?

56:40.169 --> 56:42.160
Yes, sir, I couldn't agree more.

56:43.507 --> 56:45.873
You have proved to be quite an asset...

56:46.076 --> 56:48.704
...to the department
and to this administration.

56:48.779 --> 56:49.837
Thank you, sir.

56:49.913 --> 56:53.974
Mr. Mayor, the presentation of
the commendation starts in five minutes.

56:54.051 --> 56:57.020
- I think we'd better get going, sir.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

56:57.154 --> 57:00.123
Captain, off the record,
there are going to be changes...

57:00.190 --> 57:04.627
...in the department after the election,
and you'll figure greatly in my plans.

57:04.962 --> 57:07.829
I'm sure you'll make the right decision, sir.

57:11.268 --> 57:15.261
Do you have any comments on the arrest
of the Black militants yesterday?

57:15.706 --> 57:17.571
Later, Jim, later.

57:18.675 --> 57:22.839
Now, as Mayor of San Francisco,
I want to make it official.

57:23.247 --> 57:27.411
This is one hell of a cop.
And here come a couple more.

57:27.484 --> 57:29.247
Good morning, right this way.

57:29.319 --> 57:32.720
Lieutenant Bressler, Inspector Moore,
would you move toward the stairs.

57:32.789 --> 57:35.257
Mr. Mayor, would you join them.

57:35.325 --> 57:37.759
We're gonna have
some photographs taken here.

57:42.166 --> 57:43.997
- Is this all right, Mayor?
- Yes.

57:44.068 --> 57:46.764
Would you kindly move in
just a little tighter.

57:48.406 --> 57:52.274
Here we are, gentlemen, the two
inspectors who made the Mustapha arrest.

57:52.343 --> 57:55.107
This is Inspector Moore and Callahan.

57:56.447 --> 58:00.076
How about one with the Mayor
and Inspector Moore?

58:00.518 --> 58:04.010
Captain McKay, can you switch places
with Inspector Moore?

58:05.957 --> 58:07.447
Move in, nice and close.

58:07.525 --> 58:09.720
And, Callahan, you get in there, too!

58:11.262 --> 58:12.422
We're ready.

58:12.497 --> 58:16.263
Inspector Moore is one of the first
of her sex in the whole country...

58:16.334 --> 58:19.201
...to become
a full-time homicide investigator.

58:19.404 --> 58:23.340
And we're very proud
of her stunning professionalism.

58:24.776 --> 58:26.744
Thank you very much.

58:27.245 --> 58:31.113
Jimmy, do you want to...
Let me have some time with these people.

58:31.182 --> 58:32.012
Certainly.

58:32.083 --> 58:34.074
Could we move off to the right.

58:34.152 --> 58:36.450
We'll see each other at the conference.

58:37.756 --> 58:40.623
Now, anybody here have
the letters of commendation?

58:41.427 --> 58:43.122
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir?

58:43.195 --> 58:45.789
- Who's got the letters?
- Right here, sir.

58:46.932 --> 58:49.901
- Wait a minute, what's this?
- These are some form letters.

58:50.369 --> 58:53.600
They'll do, just so you hand them
something for the cameras.

58:53.672 --> 58:55.037
Well, all right.

58:55.107 --> 58:56.699
Thank you, Jimmy.

58:56.775 --> 59:01.508
The Mayor will introduce you,
hand you your letters of commendation...

59:01.614 --> 59:04.412
...and then you'll each move off to the left,
out of camera.

59:04.483 --> 59:06.747
And then I'm going to take
this opportunity...

59:06.819 --> 59:09.014
...to deliver a few boots in the rear...

59:09.088 --> 59:12.854
...to those people who think
the police department has gone to hell...

59:13.258 --> 59:15.158
...under this administration.

59:15.694 --> 59:17.252
Two minutes, Mr. Mayor.

59:17.329 --> 59:19.160
Well, ready? Let's go.

59:22.635 --> 59:25.297
- Just one minute, Mr. Mayor.
- Harry!

59:25.537 --> 59:28.665
Would you mind telling me
what these commendations are for?

59:28.741 --> 59:31.505
- This can wait until after the broadcast.
- No, it can't.

59:31.577 --> 59:33.568
All right, just watch it, Callahan.

59:33.646 --> 59:37.811
The Inspector has a right to know
what he's being commended for.

59:38.418 --> 59:43.754
Specifically, it's for your part
in smashing the group of terrorists...

59:43.823 --> 59:48.624
...who were trying to blackmail
San Francisco out of $2 million.

59:48.695 --> 59:50.060
Let's look at the...

59:50.130 --> 59:53.327
If you're talking about the Mustapha bust,
nobody smashed anything.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.059
What?

59:54.134 --> 59:57.661
I made a deal with him. He was to help me
find out who the people were.

59:57.737 --> 01:00:01.138
- Inspector Moore and I weren't even there.
- What is he talking about?

01:00:01.207 --> 01:00:05.610
- No weapons or explosives were found.
- We'll find them.

01:00:05.679 --> 01:00:09.171
The people are still out there.
They'll blow hell out of half this city.

01:00:09.249 --> 01:00:11.615
Meanwhile, you're telling everyone
how great we are.

01:00:11.685 --> 01:00:13.550
Button your lip. That's an order.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.112
If you want to jerk these people off
you can, but don't do it with me.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.954
Callahan, you just got yourself
a 60-day suspension.

01:00:20.026 --> 01:00:21.186
Make it 90.

01:00:21.261 --> 01:00:23.627
180. Give me your star.

01:00:26.232 --> 01:00:29.065
Here's a seven-point suppository, Captain.

01:00:29.436 --> 01:00:31.064
What did you say?

01:00:31.172 --> 01:00:33.299
I said stick it in your ass.

01:00:46.287 --> 01:00:49.723
- Mr. Mayor, you're on.
- I know, Jimmy, I know.

01:00:54.695 --> 01:00:56.822
I'll have to go down there and...

01:00:59.066 --> 01:01:02.058
Go down there and jerk them off.

01:01:10.244 --> 01:01:11.677
Inspector Callahan.

01:01:15.449 --> 01:01:17.440
Damn it, Harry, slow down.

01:01:23.023 --> 01:01:24.422
What's the matter?

01:01:24.759 --> 01:01:25.987
Nothing.

01:01:26.093 --> 01:01:28.927
Why aren't you up there
getting your commendation?

01:01:29.831 --> 01:01:31.492
You don't give up, do you?

01:01:31.566 --> 01:01:32.897
Sometimes.

01:01:33.769 --> 01:01:34.997
Not you.

01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:37.766
What makes you think so?

01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:40.234
A woman's intuition.

01:01:45.046 --> 01:01:49.710
Listen. Harry, if you need anything
or if there's anything I can do...

01:01:50.519 --> 01:01:52.384
...access to records or files...

01:01:52.888 --> 01:01:55.288
...anything, call me up.

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:58.482
I might just do that.

01:01:59.027 --> 01:02:00.085
Fine.

01:02:03.598 --> 01:02:04.656
Anytime.

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:07.464
Come on, take a walk.

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:09.031
All right.

01:02:16.444 --> 01:02:19.902
I was wondering if I'll still have a job
when I get back there.

01:02:20.148 --> 01:02:22.048
What difference does it make?

01:02:23.485 --> 01:02:25.886
What do you want to be a cop for, anyway?

01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:29.752
Why aren't you married
and having kids like everybody else?

01:02:29.826 --> 01:02:31.123
Why aren't you?

01:02:32.428 --> 01:02:34.794
Nobody in their right mind's asking.

01:02:37.233 --> 01:02:38.962
<i>Coitis interruptus.</i>

01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:40.635
I beg your pardon?

01:02:40.703 --> 01:02:43.797
Coit Tower, it's vaguely phallic,
don't you think?

01:02:46.776 --> 01:02:48.835
I never thought of it that way.

01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:52.070
I make up names for things.

01:02:52.148 --> 01:02:57.051
For instance, you're "Cold, bold Callahan
with his great big.44."

01:02:59.722 --> 01:03:03.658
Every other cop in this city
is satisfied with a.38 or a 357.

01:03:03.726 --> 01:03:06.320
What do you have to carry that cannon for?

01:03:06.896 --> 01:03:09.262
So I can hit what I aim at, that's why.

01:03:09.465 --> 01:03:11.729
A 357 is a good weapon,
but I've seen.38s...

01:03:11.801 --> 01:03:14.827
...careen off windshields.
No good in a city like this.

01:03:14.904 --> 01:03:18.965
I see, so it's for the penetration?

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:23.578
Does everything have
a sexual connotation with you?

01:03:25.315 --> 01:03:26.839
Only sometimes.

01:03:28.418 --> 01:03:30.511
Want to go have a few beers?

01:03:36.159 --> 01:03:39.458
You've got a lot of nerve
the way you talk to the Mayor.

01:03:39.529 --> 01:03:40.587
And McKay.

01:03:41.698 --> 01:03:43.825
Besides being wrong, they're stupid.

01:03:44.334 --> 01:03:48.202
They arrested the wrong guy,
but their egos won't let them admit it.

01:03:48.705 --> 01:03:50.764
- You mean Mustapha?
- Yeah.

01:03:52.175 --> 01:03:54.302
I had a deal with Mustapha.

01:03:54.444 --> 01:03:58.608
He put me on to Bobby Maxwell, the guy
who knifed DiGeorgio, I'm sure of it.

01:03:58.682 --> 01:04:00.411
Where can we find Maxwell?

01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:03.044
We can't, now with Mustapha busted,
can we?

01:04:04.254 --> 01:04:07.280
Maxwell's a prime candidate,
he's a real tough cookie.

01:04:07.357 --> 01:04:09.416
He was in Vietnam, likes combat.

01:04:09.493 --> 01:04:12.553
He was finally busted out
of the service on a Section 8.

01:04:12.629 --> 01:04:15.860
Well, we're good citizens,
why don't we post Mustapha's bail?

01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:17.457
Not a bad idea.

01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:20.967
Big question is: Will he work with us now?

01:04:23.274 --> 01:04:25.265
Want to have a couple of beers?

01:04:26.844 --> 01:04:28.641
Why didn't I think of that?

01:04:35.653 --> 01:04:38.121
Only thing they had worth drinking
was apple juice.

01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:39.952
- Anything's okay.
- Here.

01:04:40.024 --> 01:04:41.389
I'm sorry.

01:04:43.328 --> 01:04:44.955
You like fishing?

01:04:45.897 --> 01:04:49.162
I have an Auntie Kate, I'm called after her.

01:04:49.968 --> 01:04:53.665
When I was a little girl,
she had a ranch up in Oroville.

01:04:54.472 --> 01:04:57.964
We used to fish together,
I'd even bait my own hooks.

01:04:59.644 --> 01:05:01.737
Is that what they call you, Kate?

01:05:02.914 --> 01:05:04.609
That or Inspector Moore.

01:05:07.185 --> 01:05:11.053
Well, Inspector Moore, I don't like
to get too friendly with partners.

01:05:11.122 --> 01:05:13.989
I know. I mean I understand.

01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:15.682
Kate...

01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:21.325
...you know whoever draws you
as a partner could do a lot worse.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:51.989
Mr. Mayor, I think if we want to beat
the crowd, we should leave now.

01:05:52.064 --> 01:05:55.795
You think so? You may be right.

01:05:55.968 --> 01:05:57.936
I'll see you, Karl.

01:05:58.003 --> 01:05:59.971
You don't have to come back to the office.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.973
- Take over, fellas.
- Take it easy.

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:04.475
- You hold onto this.
- Sure thing.

01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:10.481
- Nice to see you.
- We are running a little late, sir.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.487
- Please, come on, sir.
- How you doing?

01:06:30.937 --> 01:06:32.734
All right, talk to me.

01:06:32.806 --> 01:06:33.898
He's on his way.

01:06:33.973 --> 01:06:34.997
Beautiful.

01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:38.309
- Everything set?
- I'm ready.

01:07:27.528 --> 01:07:28.654
Hi there.

01:07:28.996 --> 01:07:32.363
Well, hello there, young lady.
What can I do for you?

01:07:33.167 --> 01:07:34.794
Raise the bridge.

01:07:36.537 --> 01:07:37.902
Raise the bridge?

01:07:39.206 --> 01:07:40.571
Are you kidding?

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:42.639
When I tell you to.

01:07:51.152 --> 01:07:52.915
I wish we could've stayed.

01:07:54.388 --> 01:07:56.913
I think the Giants
are gonna finally win one.

01:07:56.991 --> 01:08:01.451
I don't know, Mr. Mayor,
looks like it could end up as a no-hitter.

01:08:02.062 --> 01:08:04.656
Besides, you do have
a testimonial this evening.

01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:09.227
God, testimonials.
They never end, do they?

01:08:13.575 --> 01:08:15.133
Give me the Taser gun.

01:08:15.677 --> 01:08:16.871
Karl.

01:08:24.252 --> 01:08:27.345
<i>Man, this thing looks like something
from a James Bond movie.</i>

01:08:27.421 --> 01:08:29.014
Sure it'll work?

01:08:29.823 --> 01:08:32.759
Karl, there's 25,000 volts in this thing.

01:08:32.827 --> 01:08:36.490
Even the fat boy's gonna do what we want
once we hook him up to it.

01:08:45.573 --> 01:08:46.666
Okay, Tex.

01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:58.314
Raise it.

01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:27.211
What the hell! Dave, get me out of this.

01:09:33.656 --> 01:09:35.680
Don't hit the Mayor, goddamn it!

01:09:58.414 --> 01:10:00.542
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:01.675
You.

01:10:02.619 --> 01:10:06.020
Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:10:06.089 --> 01:10:08.080
The hell you aren't!

01:11:08.152 --> 01:11:12.680
<i>We're still trying to get details and
as they come in we'll get them to you.</i>

01:11:12.757 --> 01:11:15.954
<i>- Somebody said the Mayor was killed.
- That was the first report.</i>

01:11:16.027 --> 01:11:17.824
<i>Then we heard he was kidnapped.</i>

01:11:17.895 --> 01:11:21.490
<i>There's something heavy going on
in China Basin, that's for sure.</i>

01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:24.160
<i>Okay, listen, I've got to go.
Thanks for calling.</i>

01:11:24.235 --> 01:11:26.203
<i>You're rapping with Bubba, go ahead.</i>

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:29.364
The Mayor of this pig city
has been taken prisoner of war...

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.965
...by the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force.

01:11:34.245 --> 01:11:37.510
<i>Everybody's a comedian tonight.
Look, this is very serious.</i>

01:11:38.383 --> 01:11:39.782
Hey, man, look...

01:11:39.851 --> 01:11:43.082
...l'm leaving a tape of our demands
in the booth across the street.

01:11:43.888 --> 01:11:45.651
<i>Power to the people!</i>

01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:49.822
<i>Okay, we're gonna do a little music
and I'll be right back.</i>

01:12:09.782 --> 01:12:10.942
Harry?

01:12:12.684 --> 01:12:15.619
- What can I do for you?
- We've got to talk.

01:12:15.954 --> 01:12:17.478
Go right ahead.

01:12:19.258 --> 01:12:22.716
I want all the information
that you have on this case, Callahan.

01:12:23.395 --> 01:12:27.491
- Black militants, remember?
- Come on, Harry, so we were wrong.

01:12:29.234 --> 01:12:32.499
- I'll handle this one.
- No. We play as a team.

01:12:34.673 --> 01:12:38.939
As I remember, the last time we played
as a team I got the cue stuck in my ass.

01:12:39.011 --> 01:12:42.845
Harry, we just got a tape,
this time they're asking for $5 million.

01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:45.884
Or they send back the Mayor,
one piece at a time.

01:12:45.951 --> 01:12:48.579
The negotiations
are at a crucial point right now.

01:12:48.654 --> 01:12:51.283
What are you going to do,
pay the bastards?

01:12:51.791 --> 01:12:56.228
Well, the Mayor's family is loaded,
they can afford it.

01:12:57.530 --> 01:13:01.193
What about the people who were killed?
Or isn't it against the law anymore?

01:13:01.267 --> 01:13:04.430
We're not debating the point,
I'm simply saying you're out of it.

01:13:04.504 --> 01:13:05.562
What you're saying is:

01:13:05.638 --> 01:13:09.836
Whoever's got balls to grab a hostage,
will do it. And can walk away from it.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:12.471
I'm saying, you're out of it.

01:13:12.545 --> 01:13:16.242
If I hear otherwise,
you're finished as a cop in San Francisco.

01:13:16.449 --> 01:13:22.183
I want every bit of information you have
on this case, every lead. Is that clear?

01:13:22.388 --> 01:13:24.856
- May I make a statement, McKay?
- Go ahead!

01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:27.282
Your mouthwash ain't making it!

01:13:45.913 --> 01:13:48.347
You got any more surprises for me today?

01:13:49.049 --> 01:13:50.641
What do you mean?

01:13:50.985 --> 01:13:53.215
I mean, are you and McKay
going to throw...

01:13:53.287 --> 01:13:56.279
...another one
of those paddy-wagon parties for me?

01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:01.194
That frigging McKay,
he's something, isn't he?

01:14:02.096 --> 01:14:05.463
Now, I want a line
on this Revolutionary Strike Force.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.700
You got to be kidding.

01:14:09.036 --> 01:14:10.560
No, I'm not kidding.

01:14:10.638 --> 01:14:13.664
If you don't give it to me,
I'll let it out that you're an ear.

01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:17.142
Don't say that, not even joking.

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.048
Who's joking?

01:14:23.684 --> 01:14:27.381
You really are a dirty bastard,
ain't you, Harry?

01:14:28.055 --> 01:14:29.283
The dirtiest.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.988
Word has it that Bobby Maxwell and this...

01:14:37.898 --> 01:14:39.229
...chick, Wanda...

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.929
...they're running around
with these dudes who call themselves...

01:14:43.004 --> 01:14:46.235
...the People's Revolutionary Strike Force.

01:14:46.308 --> 01:14:47.434
"Call themselves."

01:14:47.509 --> 01:14:50.307
They don't believe in that shit.

01:14:50.745 --> 01:14:54.579
They're just interested in the bread,
that's where their head's at.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:57.043
Where do I find this Wanda?

01:14:57.218 --> 01:15:01.882
She's a tall brunette,
works at Tiffany's on Broadway.

01:15:04.593 --> 01:15:05.787
Thanks.

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:12.160
Do them in.

01:15:13.268 --> 01:15:15.293
You can count on that.

01:15:45.768 --> 01:15:46.860
Hi there.

01:15:46.936 --> 01:15:49.700
- Is this Tiffany's?
- Like the sign says.

01:15:49.772 --> 01:15:51.399
My name is Larry Dickman...

01:15:51.474 --> 01:15:54.272
...my brother was here last week.
Tall fella, balding.

01:15:54.343 --> 01:15:55.708
Remember him well.

01:15:55.778 --> 01:15:57.803
Has a gold tooth right in front.

01:15:57.947 --> 01:15:59.278
That's him.

01:16:01.484 --> 01:16:03.748
You know what I bet you'd like.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.021
I bet you'd like to learn the love tussle.

01:16:07.356 --> 01:16:11.087
That sounds swell,
but I was looking for a certain girl.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.685
We've got a whole bunch of them,
warm and willing.

01:16:13.763 --> 01:16:15.958
- Her name's Wanda.
- Anybody you want.

01:16:16.032 --> 01:16:18.330
My brother says she's terrific.

01:16:18.467 --> 01:16:19.661
Can I trust you?

01:16:19.735 --> 01:16:20.827
Yeah.

01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:23.404
What it is, is $75.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.164
$75?

01:16:25.241 --> 01:16:27.573
Of course, that includes...

01:16:29.378 --> 01:16:33.246
We're not supposed to do this,
you understand, because the heat is on...

01:16:33.315 --> 01:16:35.510
...but seeing your brother was here...

01:16:36.887 --> 01:16:40.254
...the $75 includes personal instructions...

01:16:40.323 --> 01:16:43.292
...in 32 positions of lovemaking.

01:16:43.827 --> 01:16:45.192
That many?

01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:49.997
$75, you pay me first.

01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:52.366
Oh, yeah.

01:16:59.509 --> 01:17:00.999
Right this way.

01:17:11.855 --> 01:17:12.879
What's this?

01:17:12.956 --> 01:17:16.414
You've heard of a tackling dummy,
well, it's the same principle.

01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:21.088
I see, for $75 you get to make it
with a rubber dolly.

01:17:21.164 --> 01:17:22.756
Thirty-two ways!

01:17:22.999 --> 01:17:24.489
Any objections?

01:17:24.568 --> 01:17:27.503
No, is there one
where the man gets on top?

01:17:27.704 --> 01:17:28.671
Thirty-three!

01:17:29.573 --> 01:17:32.839
Just take your duds off, honey.
I'll send your teacher in.

01:17:37.915 --> 01:17:39.177
Hi there.

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.681
You're not Wanda.

01:17:40.752 --> 01:17:43.653
Well, these are the breaks. Needs air.

01:17:44.055 --> 01:17:46.649
Can't hump a limp dummy, I always say.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.390
Speaking of limp dummies,
hadn't you better strip?

01:17:52.463 --> 01:17:53.760
Where's Wanda?

01:17:53.831 --> 01:17:56.356
Beats the hell out of me, Tom.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.038
Now, I'm gonna ask you just one last time.

01:18:05.109 --> 01:18:08.169
- Where's Wanda?
- I don't know.

01:18:08.412 --> 01:18:10.846
She left here a couple of weeks ago.

01:18:10.915 --> 01:18:13.884
Ask Buchinsky.
He runs the whole damn street.

01:18:13.985 --> 01:18:17.614
- Where do I find this Buchinsky?
- Down the hall, to the right.

01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:06.067
<i>That's right, my friends,
nearer my God to thee.</i>

01:19:06.138 --> 01:19:08.038
<i>That's why brother Bob is here.</i>

01:19:08.106 --> 01:19:10.700
<i>Brother Bob is here
to bring you nearer to the Lord.</i>

01:19:10.776 --> 01:19:13.768
<i>To bring you nearer to the man.
To save your soul.</i>

01:19:13.912 --> 01:19:16.073
<i>Salvation is where it is at, brother.</i>

01:19:17.249 --> 01:19:20.412
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

01:19:20.686 --> 01:19:23.621
- You a lawyer?
- Seeing as you ask, yes, I am.

01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:26.180
I'm looking for a tall brunette,
named Wanda.

01:19:26.759 --> 01:19:30.752
I want to tell you something, punk.
This is a protected operation.

01:19:30.997 --> 01:19:34.160
Now, you can end up with your balls
in spaghetti sauce.

01:19:34.234 --> 01:19:37.328
Are you trying to say you've a lot of clout
with the syndicate?

01:19:37.403 --> 01:19:41.464
Enough to blow you away with one call.
Now get the hell out of here!

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:46.137
I'll tell you what you are to me.
Just a maggot who sells dirty pictures.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.925
- Wanda, where is she?
- Go to hell.

01:20:10.036 --> 01:20:13.494
- One more time, Wanda.
- All right, all right.

01:20:15.842 --> 01:20:18.777
She quit a couple of weeks ago,
that's all I know.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.879
She got religious.

01:20:23.016 --> 01:20:26.453
- What do you mean?
- Hanging around the church on Garvey.

01:20:31.525 --> 01:20:33.959
<i>Captain, is it true
you received another ransom tape...</i>

01:20:34.028 --> 01:20:36.258
<i>... from the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force?</i>

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.491
<i>- Yes, we have.
- Is the Mayor all right?</i>

01:20:38.565 --> 01:20:42.865
<i>We have been assured that he's okay
but, of course, there won't be...</i>

01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:46.901
<i>... any payment or arrangement
for transportation until we have...</i>

01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:48.839
<i>... seen the Mayor with our own eyes.</i>

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:52.504
<i>- Then you're letting the kidnappers go?
- That is the agreement.</i>

01:20:52.579 --> 01:20:55.844
<i>- Any idea where they are holed up?
- Not yet...</i>

01:20:55.916 --> 01:20:59.716
<i>... but we should get one more message
this evening. If you'll excuse me.</i>

01:20:59.887 --> 01:21:03.084
<i>Is it true that Inspector Callahan
has been taken off this case?</i>

01:21:03.157 --> 01:21:04.988
<i>I'm sorry, no more questions.</i>

01:21:14.034 --> 01:21:15.126
What do you have?

01:21:15.202 --> 01:21:19.400
I got the priest, John Voss, Father John,
very militant, very big in prison reform.

01:21:19.473 --> 01:21:24.309
He runs rehabilitation seminars
in all the prisons in this area.

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:27.678
This is a list of the prisoners
that took the seminar in San Quentin.

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:30.377
Bobby Maxwell never missed a session.

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.580
- You wait here.
- Wait, wait.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:36.886
Fessenheim. The latest ransom tape
mentioned Fessenheim again.

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.653
And what does that mean?

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:42.891
Last year, two bombs were exploded
at a nuclear plant near Fessenheim, France.

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.557
How about that.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.368
The body of Christ.

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.379
The body of Christ.

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:09.150
The body...

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.188
Remember me, Father?

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:13.783
Yes.

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.092
What is it you want, Callahan?

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:18.690
I'd like to talk to you
about Bobby Maxwell.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.226
Then get a warrant.

01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:44.047
- Just a minute.
- I thought I made it clear to you, Officer.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:46.458
I have nothing whatsoever to say to you.

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:51.723
And what right do you have to come
in here and harass me in my church?

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:55.967
- Is that a confessional over there?
- You want to make a confession?

01:22:56.038 --> 01:22:58.734
You first!

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:02.505
Where the hell's Maxwell?

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:04.872
God just might forgive you, but I won't.

01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:08.246
Why do you protect these people?
Do you know how many they've killed?

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:11.878
Sacrifices have to be made, mister.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.952
These people are at war!

01:23:14.024 --> 01:23:15.252
So am I.

01:23:15.826 --> 01:23:18.886
How dare you pull a gun
in the house of God.

01:23:18.962 --> 01:23:21.123
If you don't believe in the sanctity...

01:23:21.198 --> 01:23:24.395
I don't have time
to argue religion with you, boy.

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:35.033
Look at her hands!

01:23:44.788 --> 01:23:48.349
- There wasn't supposed to be any killing.
- Is she dead?

01:23:54.965 --> 01:23:56.660
I close my eyes to this.

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:01.867
Father in heaven, help me.

01:24:01.938 --> 01:24:04.065
You can't close your eyes anymore.

01:24:06.543 --> 01:24:08.272
Now, where's Maxwell?

01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:22.053
Alcatraz.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.450
A place to hole up.

01:24:26.264 --> 01:24:29.131
I don't suppose
it would do any good to suggest...

01:24:30.902 --> 01:24:32.392
Forget it.

01:24:35.706 --> 01:24:38.641
<i>No further communications
have been received since the last...</i>

01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:42.873
Nothing. You sure Wanda
got those tapes to the cops?

01:24:43.347 --> 01:24:45.838
Bobby, I don't know.

01:24:46.817 --> 01:24:49.581
I don't know, I don't... I wasn't with her.

01:24:55.493 --> 01:24:58.155
- If you didn't think she could do it...
- Shut up!

01:24:58.229 --> 01:25:00.891
- What are you doing here?
- A lousy cup of coffee, okay?

01:25:10.776 --> 01:25:13.244
Hey, can't you see it says no trespassing?

01:25:15.214 --> 01:25:17.079
Get the hell out of here.

01:25:20.586 --> 01:25:23.612
Jesus Christ, man, get your ass out there!

01:26:22.448 --> 01:26:23.642
Lalo.

01:26:23.716 --> 01:26:26.651
Let's get the Mayor.
We'll bring him in here and hold out.

01:28:40.688 --> 01:28:43.782
I'll get the bar.
You get that son of a bitch out of there.

01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:59.466
Freeze!

01:29:01.143 --> 01:29:04.010
All right, let him go.

01:29:06.015 --> 01:29:09.781
Move over there, Your Honor. That's fine.

01:29:11.821 --> 01:29:15.780
Okay, now, I want you very slowly...

01:29:16.859 --> 01:29:18.827
...to put down that weapon...

01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:21.855
...and then on the deck,
and spread your legs.

01:29:24.066 --> 01:29:25.795
Are you kidding me?

01:29:26.335 --> 01:29:29.896
You laugh at me, you bastard,
and I'll shoot you where you stand.

01:29:42.051 --> 01:29:45.509
Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go!

01:29:45.788 --> 01:29:48.882
Let's get out of here. Now speed it up!

01:29:50.392 --> 01:29:51.917
Stay with me.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:53.760
Hold it.

01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:56.697
Just take it very easy.

01:29:58.335 --> 01:30:02.601
You relax, do just as I say,
and I'll get you home, all right?

01:30:02.672 --> 01:30:03.570
Yes.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:07.235
All right, take it slow. Wait a minute.

01:30:08.979 --> 01:30:10.344
Here we go.

01:30:43.547 --> 01:30:44.980
Harry, look out!

01:31:06.304 --> 01:31:09.364
Oh, Harry, I messed up.

01:31:09.574 --> 01:31:11.303
You're doing just fine, Kate.

01:31:11.375 --> 01:31:13.070
Let me get you out of here.

01:31:16.881 --> 01:31:19.975
Don't concern yourself, Harry.

01:31:27.358 --> 01:31:28.620
Get him.

01:31:35.333 --> 01:31:36.960
You can count on it.

01:32:09.868 --> 01:32:11.733
You fucking fruit!

01:32:20.145 --> 01:32:21.635
Get up there!

01:32:25.517 --> 01:32:27.178
Go on, move!

01:32:49.175 --> 01:32:50.972
Oh, God!

01:33:30.683 --> 01:33:34.119
Callahan, you saved my life.

01:33:35.455 --> 01:33:39.586
I'll never be able to thank you.
I'll never be able to tell you.

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.653
There will be a letter of commendation
there for you.

01:34:03.383 --> 01:34:05.112
The chopper's here.

01:34:05.886 --> 01:34:08.753
Don't you want to ride...

01:34:43.625 --> 01:34:44.853
<i>Maxwell.</i>

01:34:45.326 --> 01:34:49.422
<i>Bobby Maxwell,
this is Captain McKay speaking.</i>

01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:51.994
<i>We have your money.</i>

01:34:53.001 --> 01:34:55.993
<i>A plane is waiting for you at the airport.</i>

01:34:56.871 --> 01:35:00.034
<i>We have acceded to all your demands...</i>

01:35:00.675 --> 01:35:02.609
<i>... so release the Mayor.</i>

01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:07.404
<i>The pilot of this helicopter
will fly you and your men to safety.</i>
