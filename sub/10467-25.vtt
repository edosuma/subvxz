"I DON'T TRUST YOU,"

09:45.802 --> 09:48.805
NO. MAKE THAT AFTER
YOU HAVE ACED IT.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.547
IT'S ALL
THE BIOCHEMISTRY
YOU NEED TO KNOW,

09:51.547 --> 09:54.028
MINUS THE POINTLESS
FILLERS THAT YOU'RE
GETTING HOPPED UP

09:54.028 --> 09:55.464

09:55.464 --> 09:57.379
DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT
I SAID TO YOU BEFORE?

09:57.379 --> 10:00.338

ABOUT THIS WHOLE, UH...

10:00.338 --> 10:02.079
VOW OF SOLITUDE THING,

10:02.079 --> 10:05.996
AND I THINK
IT'S FANTASTIC. I DO.

10:05.996 --> 10:09.652
BUT WHY DON'T YOU STOP
BEFORE YOU BECOME A NUN?

10:09.652 --> 10:10.958
THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.350
THAT'S NOT WHY I SAID NO
TO YOUR HELP.

10:12.350 --> 10:16.006
I HAVE ZERO FEAR OF US
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

10:16.006 --> 10:19.140
JULIA, I WAS JUST
OFFERING YOU MY NOTES.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.011
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT US
GETTING BACK TOGETHER,

10:21.011 --> 10:23.318
BUT, UH, ZERO?

10:23.318 --> 10:26.016
JUSTIN, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU'RE STILL
NOT LISTENING.

10:26.016 --> 10:29.629
BEING ON MY OWN,
THAT'S NOT JUST
A RELATIONSHIP THING.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.153
I HAVE TO LEARN
TO DEPEND ON MYSELF
FOR LOTS OF THINGS.

10:32.153 --> 10:35.417
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
WHAT AM I GAINING?

10:35.417 --> 10:37.245

THAT I CAN DO IT MYSELF,

10:37.245 --> 10:40.509

TO SOME YALE UNIVERSITY

10:42.990 --> 10:46.776

I GOTTA DO HOMEWORK WITH OWEN.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.395

10:57.395 --> 10:58.788
BAILEY,
THIS IS MY LAST EXAM.

10:58.788 --> 10:59.963
MY SCHOLARSHIP RIDES
ON THIS ONE GRADE,

10:59.963 --> 11:02.009
SO IF YOU COULD JUST
CHECK MY SCORE FOR ME,

11:02.009 --> 11:04.664
THEN I'LL DO
OWEN'S HOMEWORK.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.753
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET STARTED?
WE'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.667

11:10.670 --> 11:14.369

DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

11:14.369 --> 11:16.066
YOU'RE FREE?

11:16.066 --> 11:18.025
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY KIND
OF LAST-MINUTE STUDY GROUP?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.417
NO. I TOLD YOU
IT WAS THE LAST EXAM.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.071
NOW, WHAT ARE THEY
SAYING?

11:21.071 --> 11:23.813
UH, NOTHING. THEY'RE
SEARCHING THEIR RECORDS.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.424
WHY AM I EVEN PUTTING
MYSELF THROUGH THIS?

11:26.424 --> 11:27.425
I MEAN, I'LL NEVER WIN.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.557
MY ESSAY IS SO...

11:28.557 --> 11:30.167

WITH SOME KID

11:30.167 --> 11:31.821

KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS
FROM HER LIFE?

11:35.042 --> 11:37.392
WHAT? HOW DID I DO,
BAILEY?

11:37.392 --> 11:42.789
FOR YOUR GPA, YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED AT LEAST A 93?

11:47.271 --> 11:49.143
I'M SORRY.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.710
WOW.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.670

12:00.807 --> 12:02.504
FORGET IT.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.462
JUST PUT IT
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

12:04.462 --> 12:05.463
FORGET IT?
YES.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.421
I REALLY WANTED THIS.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.249
I KNOW, BUT...

12:08.249 --> 12:10.294
TONIGHT...

12:10.294 --> 12:12.122
TONIGHT
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT.

12:12.122 --> 12:15.125
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THIS AMAZING ROMANTIC
NIGHT TOGETHER,

12:15.125 --> 12:16.953
AND YOU'RE GONNA
PUT ALL OF THIS
BEHIND YOU.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.086

YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.478
NO, I AM.
I KNOW THIS HURTS.

12:20.478 --> 12:23.830
I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY,
BUT THE WAY I SEE IT,

12:23.830 --> 12:25.483
IT MEANS NOTHING.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.571
THESE SCHOLARSHIP GUYS,
IF THEY SAY NO,

12:26.571 --> 12:28.356
THEY KNOW NOTHING.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.751
I WOULD PICK YOU
OVER ANYONE
IN THAT COMPETITION.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.492
I WOULD PICK YOU OVER
ANYONE IN THE WORLD.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.451

I WOULD PICK YOU...

12:37.626 --> 12:38.540

WHAT AM I DOING?
I'M SORRY.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.418
NO. IT'S OK.

12:47.418 --> 12:52.032
HOW DID I GET SO LUCKY
TO FIND YOU?

TO DESERVE YOU?

13:01.519 --> 13:03.521

13:03.521 --> 13:05.523
I DID. IT COOLS
THE BOTTLES QUICKER.

CAME OFF.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.592
AND THIS DIAMOND RING
ON MY FINGER?

31:04.601 --> 31:05.733
WHAT IS IT?

31:05.733 --> 31:07.430
WHAT'S WRONG?

31:07.430 --> 31:12.174
I MEAN, I KNOW
HOW IT ALL STARTED.

31:12.174 --> 31:15.221
IT STARTED WITH YOU.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.266
AND IT WAS GREAT.

31:17.266 --> 31:21.531
BUT THEN THINGS
STARTED HAPPENING.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.708
YOU TOOK ON OWEN.
WE MOVED HERE.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.928
THAT GAVE US CLAUD
AND THE HOUSE,

31:26.928 --> 31:29.452
AND THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S ALL FINE.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.151
EXCEPT I DON'T REMEMBER
ASKING FOR ANY OF THIS.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.849
OK, SARAH. I KNOW.
I HEAR YOU.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.807
YOU ARE
WHAT I ASKED FOR.

31:36.807 --> 31:40.028
YOU AND SCHOOL,

31:40.028 --> 31:42.552
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
THERE'S LESS AND LESS ROOM

31:42.552 --> 31:43.945
FOR WHAT I ASKED FOR.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.513
OK, SO WE'LL
WORK ON ALL THAT.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.515
OK? WE'LL
MOVE THINGS AROUND.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.952
THINGS LIKE OWEN?

31:50.952 --> 31:54.434
BAILEY, COME ON,
HE'S A CHILD.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.436
AND HE NEEDS
WHAT HE NEEDS.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.743
AND MY COLLEGE PROBLEMS.

31:59.743 --> 32:03.008
THEY JUST DON'T SEEM
TO MATTER THAT MUCH.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.532
NOT NOW AND ESPECIALLY
NOT ONCE WE'RE MARRIED.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.360
COME ON, GIMME SOME
CREDIT HERE.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.624
YOU DON'T THINK THAT I CARE
ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU?

32:10.624 --> 32:13.148
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA FIND A WAY
TO MAKE ALL THIS WORK?

32:16.412 --> 32:19.502
WHAT IF I DON'T
WANT IT TO WORK, BAILEY?

32:23.202 --> 32:27.554
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

32:27.554 --> 32:32.341
I REALLY DO, BUT I'M 19
AND IN COLLEGE.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.997
AND FOR ME, THAT MEANS
TRYING STUFF OUT,

32:35.997 --> 32:37.607
LIKE MAKING MISTAKES.

32:37.607 --> 32:42.177
BUT MISTAKES WHERE I CAN
TAKE AN "INCOMPLETE"

32:42.177 --> 32:45.354
IF, YOU KNOW, THINGS
AREN'T WORKING OUT.

32:45.354 --> 32:48.053
NOT MISTAKES WHERE
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES

32:48.053 --> 32:50.272
ARE RIDING
ON WHAT I CHOOSE.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.016
SARAH...

32:55.016 --> 32:57.279
I CAN'T BE ENGAGED
TO YOU, BAILEY.

33:00.674 --> 33:01.892
I'M SORRY,

33:01.892 --> 33:03.285
BUT I CAN'T.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.820
YOU SURE HE DOESN'T MIND,
THOUGH?

33:16.820 --> 33:18.518
WE COULD STILL CANCEL.
THERE'S STILL TIME
TO MAKE THE CALLS.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.737
THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAID.
OFFERED, LIKE, 50 TIMES,

33:20.737 --> 33:22.217
BUT YOU KNOW BAILEY.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.438
HE WOULDN'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

33:25.438 --> 33:28.615
HEY, WHAT TIME IS IT?
SHOULDN'T DIANA BE HERE?

33:28.615 --> 33:30.704
DAPHNE IS A LITTLE LATE.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.836
YOU DID TELL HER THE HOUSE,
NOT THE APARTMENT, RIGHT?

33:32.836 --> 33:34.577
YEAH, YEAH.
I WROTE IT ALL DOWN.

33:34.577 --> 33:35.796
HI.

33:35.796 --> 33:36.971
HI. HEY.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.625
YOU GUYS
GET ENOUGH SODA?

33:38.625 --> 33:39.756
'CAUSE I CAN
GRAB SOME MORE
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.236
NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE ALL SET.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.716
LISTEN, UM, DO YOU
HAVE A MINUTE,

33:42.716 --> 33:45.110
'CAUSE WE'VE HARDLY TALKED
ABOUT ALL THIS SARAH STUFF.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.981
I GOT TO GO
GET SOME CANDLES.

33:46.981 --> 33:50.071
THE ONES AROUND HERE ARE
ALL DOWN TO THE WICKS,
SO--

33:50.071 --> 33:50.898
I'LL BE BACK.

33:58.384 --> 33:59.820
THANKS.

34:02.518 --> 34:06.435
BAILEY, COULD WE, UM,
COULD WE TALK ABOUT
THIS, PLEASE?

34:06.435 --> 34:09.308
NOT RIGHT NOW, SARAH, OK?
THIS IS CHARLIE'S PARTY.

34:09.308 --> 34:13.094
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
BE LIKE THIS?

34:13.094 --> 34:15.966
YOU'RE GONNA
AVOID ME ALL NIGHT?

34:15.966 --> 34:18.360
YOU BROKE OFF
OUR ENGAGEMENT, SARAH.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.058
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FEEL ABOUT THAT?

34:21.189 --> 34:23.496
I DON'T KNOW.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.976
BUT WE WEREN'T ENGAGED
3 DAYS AGO,

34:25.976 --> 34:27.369
AND YOU WERE OK, THEN.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.544
COME ON, SARAH.

34:28.544 --> 34:31.721
I LOVE YOU. BAILEY,
THAT'S THE SAME.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.898
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.901
THINK ABOUT IT.

34:37.901 --> 34:40.339
THINK ABOUT
WHAT NO MEANS.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.384
NO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE
DOUBTS ABOUT ME.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.386
IT MEANS I HAVE
DOUBTS ABOUT ME.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.127
THAT'S THE
SAME THING, SARAH.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.955
IT MEANS YOU DON'T WANNA
GET MARRIED TO ME

34:47.955 --> 34:49.957
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
HELP BUT THINK

34:49.957 --> 34:53.308
THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE,
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU.

34:53.308 --> 34:56.790
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
BETTER FOR YOU THAN ME.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.662
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT,
BAILEY.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.403
I DIDN'T.

35:01.403 --> 35:04.145
BUT IF THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE,

35:04.145 --> 35:06.756
SOMETHING ELSE
OUT THERE FOR ME,

35:06.756 --> 35:08.062
THEN I'VE
NEVER FOUND IT.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.759
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL MY LIFE,

35:09.759 --> 35:12.240
AND THE BEST THING THAT
I HAVE FOUND BY FAR
IS YOU.

35:29.039 --> 35:31.216
HEY, CLAUD.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.566
GOD, LOOK AT YOU.

35:33.566 --> 35:36.351
YOU LOOK...GREAT.
THAT DRESS IS--

35:36.351 --> 35:38.092
COULD YOU NOT SAY THAT
LIKE THAT, PLEASE?

35:38.092 --> 35:40.312
WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH--

35:40.312 --> 35:42.662
IT'S THE SAME AS SAYING
WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE, BAILEY.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.446
IT'S STILL TRYING TO MAKE ME
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO BE.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.671
OK, I'M SORRY, CLAUD.

35:51.671 --> 35:55.022
NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
THAT'S--

35:55.022 --> 35:57.024
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANTED TO SAY.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.333
I HEARD ABOUT SARAH.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.859
I KNOW YOU'RE
PROBABLY FEELING...

36:08.122 --> 36:09.602
I...

36:09.602 --> 36:11.647
GOT THIS FOR YOU.

36:18.132 --> 36:21.657
IT'S MY NEW PAGER NUMBER.
FOR YOUR ROLODEX.

36:21.657 --> 36:25.313
'CAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
I BEG YOU TO STOP,

36:25.313 --> 36:29.099
I KNOW THAT
YOU'LL STILL WORRY.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.884
SO...

36:32.886 --> 36:35.845
CLAUDIA, THAT'S--THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

36:35.845 --> 36:39.893
WHAT'S THIS?

36:39.893 --> 36:43.157
OH, UM...IT'S THE BILL
FOR THE PAGER.

36:43.157 --> 36:45.638
I GOT YOU
A REALLY GOOD DEAL.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.037
Kirsten: THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.213
OH, HI.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.345
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.434
I LOST THAT PIECE OF PAPER
YOU GAVE ME,

36:59.434 --> 37:00.740
AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER
IF IT SAID 6:00 OR 7:00.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.002
IT'S 8:00 NOW, DAPHNE.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.744
OH, IS IT? SORRY.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.529
KIND OF ACTUALLY FORGOT
MY WATCH TODAY, TOO.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.577
SO...

37:11.577 --> 37:14.623
ANYWAY, UM...

37:16.495 --> 37:18.105
CONGRATULATIONS.

37:18.105 --> 37:21.543
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.284
BYE, SWEET POTATO.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.807
LOVE YOU.

37:26.374 --> 37:29.682
JOY, COULD YOU, UM,
TAKE DIANA FOR A SECOND?

37:29.682 --> 37:31.684
SURE. NO PROBLEM.

37:31.684 --> 37:34.426
THANKS.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.603
DAPHNE, HOLD ON.
WAIT A SECOND.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.779
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU? WHAT'S WRONG?

37:39.779 --> 37:41.041
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

37:41.041 --> 37:43.304
YOU LOST THE TIME
YOU WROTE DOWN?

37:43.304 --> 37:45.001
YOU FORGOT YOUR WATCH?
I MEAN, COME ON.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.873
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA BE STRAIGHT
WITH EACH OTHER.

37:46.873 --> 37:47.787
NO PRETENDING.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.965
LOOK, IT'S JUST...

37:53.445 --> 37:56.535
THIS ALL HAPPENED
SO FAST, YOU KNOW.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.406
YOU AND CHARLIE ARE
GETTING ENGAGED LIKE THAT.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.103
YOU'RE CIRCLING THE WAGONS.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.801
WAIT. "CIRCLING
THE WAGONS"?

38:01.801 --> 38:04.369
YOU'RE A FAMILY NOW, OK?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.979
AND WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE ME?

38:05.979 --> 38:07.285
I'M...

38:07.285 --> 38:09.461
WHAT?

38:09.461 --> 38:12.072
I'M SOME SORT
OF FIFTH WHEEL

38:12.072 --> 38:14.379
WHO JUST HAPPENS
TO HAVE HER NAME ON
DIANA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.380
THAT'S NOT--

38:15.380 --> 38:17.251
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

38:17.251 --> 38:19.514
I WANT TO BE
IN HER LIFE, OK?

38:19.514 --> 38:21.429
BUT NOT JUST BECAUSE
IT'S GOOD FOR ME.

38:23.866 --> 38:24.780
DAPHNE.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.438
YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:30.438 --> 38:32.135
THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD
OUT BACK.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.702
AND THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT YOU KNOW.

38:33.702 --> 38:34.877
WHY DON'T YOU STAY?

38:34.877 --> 38:36.618
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT, KIRSTEN.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.098
NO. NO PRETENDING,
REMEMBER?

38:38.098 --> 38:40.796
I WANT YOU TO STAY, OK?

38:43.538 --> 38:45.497
I WANT YOU TO STAY.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.545
JUSTIN, JUSTIN, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA BELIEVE--

38:50.545 --> 38:52.591
MAGGIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR CALLING ME.

38:52.591 --> 38:53.809
I'LL CALL YOU BACK
LATER, OK? OK.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.158
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BYE.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.203
WHAT?

38:56.203 --> 38:59.075
I WON. I WON
THE SCHOLARSHIP.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.860
THEY JUST
SENT A TELEGRAM
TO THE DORM. I WON.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.383
I WON.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.603
HEY. WAIT A MINUTE.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.300
I THOUGHT YOUR GRADES
DIDN'T CUT IT.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.171
WELL, I KNOW, BUT
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.130
OR MAYBE THEY LOVED
MY ESSAY. OR--

39:10.130 --> 39:11.697
NO, NO. YOU SAID
YOUR ESSAY SUCKED.

39:11.697 --> 39:12.915
I THOUGHT IT DID.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.440
HUH. MAYBE THEY MADE
A MISTAKE.

39:16.571 --> 39:17.790
OH.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.143
NO. THEY--

39:23.143 --> 39:25.885
THEY DIDN'T
MAKE A MISTAKE.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.582
I DID.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.758
JUSTIN,
I MADE THE MISTAKE.

39:29.758 --> 39:35.285
IT'S LIKE
NOTHING I EVER DO
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.636
AND I MEAN, MAYBE--

39:37.636 --> 39:40.943
IS THAT WHY
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED?

39:40.943 --> 39:41.944
THIS WHAT?

39:41.944 --> 39:44.251
THIS RELATIONSHIP HABIT.

39:44.251 --> 39:48.473
THE--THE WAY I KEEP
NEEDING PEOPLE.

39:48.473 --> 39:52.172
I MEAN, MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT IT IS.

39:52.172 --> 39:55.784
I KEEP
NEEDING SOMEONE AROUND
TO SAY, "HEY, IT'S OK.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.656
YOU'RE OK,
NO MATTER WHAT."

39:57.656 --> 39:59.092
YOU KNOW?

39:59.092 --> 40:02.530
KINDA LIKE MY MOM
AND DAD ALWAYS DID.

40:02.530 --> 40:06.665
YOU...ARE OK, JULIA.

40:06.665 --> 40:09.102
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

40:10.799 --> 40:12.235
I KNOW.

40:14.455 --> 40:17.893
YOU'RE SAYING THAT NOW,
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT TIME?

40:17.893 --> 40:21.419
WHAT ABOUT
WHEN YOU ARE ALONE?

40:23.377 --> 40:24.857
I'LL REMEMBER.

40:26.162 --> 40:27.468
I WILL.

40:37.217 --> 40:38.131
HEY.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.134
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:41.134 --> 40:42.788
EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR YOU
DOWNSTAIRS.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.833
NOTHING. I WAS JUST--

40:47.140 --> 40:49.142
LOOKING AROUND THIS ROOM.

40:49.142 --> 40:52.972
IT USED TO BE YOURS.

40:52.972 --> 40:55.540
PROBABLY STILL
SHOULD BE YOURS.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.890
AND ALL I CAN THINK IS...

41:01.763 --> 41:03.504
I DID EVERYTHING WRONG.

41:05.985 --> 41:08.770
BAY...COME ON, MAN.

41:08.770 --> 41:11.294
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.296
IT'S TRUE, CHARLIE.

41:15.690 --> 41:17.649
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO ANY OF THIS.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.434
'CAUSE EVERYTHING
THAT I TRY,

41:20.434 --> 41:24.699
EVERYTHING THAT FEELS
RIGHT TO ME TO DO,

41:24.699 --> 41:27.746
JUST MAKES
EVERYTHING WORSE.

41:27.746 --> 41:28.921
FOR EVERYBODY.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.491
LISTEN, UM...

41:35.014 --> 41:37.886
THE TIMING MIGHT NOT
BE RIGHT FOR THIS,

41:37.886 --> 41:40.628
MAYBE IT IS,
BUT, UH...

41:40.628 --> 41:43.413
I NEED A FAVOR FROM YOU.

41:43.413 --> 41:47.853
IT'S A LOT OF WORK, AND IT'S
SWEATING A TON OF DETAILS,

41:47.853 --> 41:50.290
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
A BEST MAN.

41:50.290 --> 41:51.944
SOMEONE I TOTALLY TRUST.

41:55.164 --> 41:55.948
BEST MAN.

41:57.776 --> 41:59.908
CHARLIE, DON'T DO IT.
DON'T DO THAT.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.736
I'LL DRIVE YOU NUTS.

42:01.736 --> 42:03.825
WE'LL BE AT
EACH OTHER'S THROATS.
BAILEY, LISTEN TO ME.

42:03.825 --> 42:06.741
I KNOW WHAT I WANT, ALL RIGHT.
I WANT THE PERFECT WEDDING.

42:06.741 --> 42:09.527
I WANNA WALK DOWN THAT AISLE,
AND I WANNA KNOW SOMEONE--

42:09.527 --> 42:13.226
SOMEONE WHO CARED,
LIKE, WAY TOO MUCH

42:13.226 --> 42:16.011
MADE SURE THAT THERE'S
NOT ONE DOILY OUT OF PLACE.

42:16.011 --> 42:18.405
NOW, WHO ELSE
CAN GIVE ME THAT--

42:18.405 --> 42:20.625
HEH HEH--BESIDES YOU?

42:24.193 --> 42:26.631
