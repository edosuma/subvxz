WEBVTT

02:17.680 --> 02:20.557
<i>Four, three, two...</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:23.101
one.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.945
Oh, God.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.951
Ten more. Then we go again.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.618
Hey!

02:43.496 --> 02:47.334
-Hey!
-There's no one out there, Scott.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.429
-It's not right.
-No, maybe it is!

02:59.512 --> 03:00.931
I feel like...

03:01.014 --> 03:05.936
where my movement ends,
your movement begins.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.981
Maybe they're connected,
like pieces of a puzzle.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.025
It's like that,
it's just sharper more.

03:12.109 --> 03:16.029
The fingers open and bend almost like
they're broken and just hanging.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.240
Why don't you just break
your fucking fingers, man?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.910
Hey!

03:28.500 --> 03:31.378
Scott, maybe
we should let Rachel sleep.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.088
No, she's...

03:33.171 --> 03:35.673
She gonna be out cold
for at least another day.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.804
I'll bet you
he's making the gas stronger.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.810
Maybe she's got a movement
inside her.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.355
Let's see, you got a bird,
he's got a sea creature.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.190
I wonder what's next.

03:54.692 --> 03:58.405
I mean, what'd you...

03:59.364 --> 04:01.074
What'd you think? You think...

04:02.659 --> 04:04.787
You think you're gonna
break your fingers back...

04:06.121 --> 04:09.958
and... and this glass is gonna melt?

04:10.042 --> 04:14.046
And a... and a door in the rock
is gonna open

04:14.129 --> 04:17.382
and we're just gonna follow
a yellow brick road right out of here?

04:17.925 --> 04:21.094
'Cause of some movements
that you fucking hallucinated?

04:22.637 --> 04:26.058
How did you explain your NDE
to people in Pittsburgh?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.101
I didn't.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.271
Why, because people would think
you're insane?

04:31.354 --> 04:36.193
No, because I knew better than to talk
about things you can't talk about.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.527
That's it.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.198
I have no idea
how to talk about this.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.201
-That's why we're just doing it.
-Doing what?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.660
Getting us out of here.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.832
And when Rachel wakes up,
maybe she'll try it, too,

04:50.916 --> 04:53.293
- and then and maybe you will.
- Prairie...

04:54.878 --> 04:57.047
I liked you better
when you were blind.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.275
Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.909
Please.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.165
Are you a feminist?

05:32.916 --> 05:36.794
Uh, I like symmetry.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.341
You were at the concert.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.927
I saw you.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.304
I didn't think you saw anyone.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.145
I don't look in the beginning,

05:53.228 --> 05:55.063
but at the end, I take in the crowd.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.400
It's like sleeping with a stranger

05:58.483 --> 06:01.278
and then asking their name
on the way out the door.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.113
To validate the intimacy.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.866
Or to invalidate it.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.453
Hmm. You're a wordsmith. Like your father.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.790
You know him?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.333
I know his work.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.336
You are a poet.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.632
-No, I'm a scientist.
-Hmm.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.927
That's obscure work
for a scientist to know.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.430
It's part of my study.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.723
What do you study?

06:32.058 --> 06:32.893
You.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.894
And people like you.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.316
Your uncanny skill level,
given how long you've been playing,

06:39.399 --> 06:41.359
is miraculous to your audience.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.485
It's inexplicable.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.779
Not to me.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.157
It's a simple scientific connection...

06:48.116 --> 06:51.494
explained... by your travels.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.832
I've never been off this island.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.585
Your travels in death.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.424
How do you know that?

07:05.383 --> 07:08.761
Three years ago you drowned,
then took up guitar.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.889
It is not a miracle.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.017
It is economics.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.771
I'm just a poor girl
trying to escape poor circumstances.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.857
Well, I can help with that.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.527
I have a plane, and I can guarantee you
safe passage to America

07:24.611 --> 07:28.573
in exchange for
limited participation in my study.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.415
I don't want to be examined.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.210
I prefer to remain unknown,
even to myself.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.172
The mind is a sticky thing.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.505
<i>We have found that</i>

08:25.588 --> 08:27.965
<i>what we have long thought</i>
<i>to be everything</i>

08:28.050 --> 08:31.344
<i>is only a small part of a grander whole,</i>

08:31.428 --> 08:34.431
<i>only one piece of a much wider cosmos.</i>

08:34.514 --> 08:37.684
<i>And to, really, kind of</i>
<i>communicate that idea,</i>

08:37.767 --> 08:39.561
<i>we've introduced this new terminology</i>

08:39.644 --> 08:42.730
<i>that our universe</i>
<i>is just one of many universes,</i>

08:42.814 --> 08:46.026
<i>populating, possibly,</i>
<i>a grander multiverse.</i>

08:46.693 --> 08:50.113
<i>Then you're on the verge</i>
<i>of a scientific revolution.</i>

08:50.196 --> 08:52.449
<i>This would be,</i>
<i>of course, a huge revolution.</i>

08:53.450 --> 08:57.495
<i>It's a revolution in a way</i>
<i>that would complete</i>

08:57.579 --> 09:01.624
<i>a meta-revolution that's been</i>
<i>in the making for five centuries.</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:03.793
<i>You know, a long time ago,</i>
<i>we all know that</i>

09:03.876 --> 09:07.214
<i>we thought that the Earth</i>
<i>was the center of everything.</i>

09:07.297 --> 09:09.799
<i>Then Copernicus comes along</i>
<i>and we learn that,</i>

09:09.882 --> 09:12.302
<i>no, the Earth is going around the sun,</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:16.431
<i>and then later, we learn the sun</i>
<i>is one of many stars in our galaxy,</i>

09:16.514 --> 09:18.558
<i>one of hundreds of billions</i>
<i>of stars in our galaxy.</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:19.809
<i>Then we learn that our galaxy is...</i>

09:31.613 --> 09:33.240
Don't stop on my account.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.783
Aren't we allowed
to do some fucking exercises?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.452
Exercise, sure.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.578
What is that?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.497
What is that thing you're doing?
Where does that come from?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.790
- We made them up.
- No.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.417
No, I don't think you did, Rachel.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.461
All respect that's due, Hap.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.672
Um, how the fuck would you know
what we make up and what we don't?

09:49.756 --> 09:50.965
No, I don't know,

09:51.048 --> 09:53.301
but I can find out, Scott,
as you're all well aware.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.220
So, somebody please tell me
what's going on right now.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.431
Right now!

10:00.933 --> 10:02.059
Scott?

10:04.146 --> 10:06.648
This isn't helping anyone!

10:06.731 --> 10:08.358
Help!

10:08.441 --> 10:10.402
Rachel?

10:10.485 --> 10:13.946
-Help! Help!
-Rachel. Rachel, calm down.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.532
Hey! Hey!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.784
Hey! Hey!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.495
Help!

10:20.578 --> 10:21.579
Help!

10:22.497 --> 10:23.581
Hey!

10:37.220 --> 10:39.431
Hey, Stan.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.848
What was that racket?

10:41.516 --> 10:43.851
Ah, it's just heavy metal.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.812
Helps me concentrate.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.730
Go figure.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.649
So... how you doing?

10:49.732 --> 10:52.360
What... what, uh...
Was just about to take a break.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.779
-Will you smoke with me?
-No, thanks. I'm fine.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.407
Listen, Hap, I feel bad
just coming up here,

10:57.490 --> 10:59.742
but you're not exactly
listed in the phone book, uh...

10:59.826 --> 11:01.703
Oh, yeah, that's... that's intentional.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.497
Oh, big city doctor
in search of peace and quiet.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.583
Yeah, I get that. I... I really do.

11:07.709 --> 11:13.506
I tell you, I never thought I'd see
this old mine looking so... so homey.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.301
Well, I like to maintain.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.721
You know, I figure order outside
will generate order inside.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.888
Yeah?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.725
Hmm.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.448
Your timber here needs a bit a work.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.118
You'll wanna get that done
before the rain comes in spring.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.413
Right, thanks. Well, uh, will do.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.124
Let me know if you need some help.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.754
Is there something
I can help you with today, Stan?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.089
You don't come around much, and...

11:57.174 --> 11:59.594
You know my wife, Evelyn.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.139
We've been struggling with her illness.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.601
ALS is a merciless disease. It's...

12:07.602 --> 12:10.397
I don't know
how much more of this she can take.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.902
It became impossible
for her to walk and grasp things,

12:15.985 --> 12:18.154
but we still talked and talked.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.990
She could laugh.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.701
But now...

12:26.663 --> 12:27.955
it's just so goddamn lonely.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.541
It's like I'm living in a haunted house.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.210
I can only imagine.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.089
She's completely trapped
in her own body.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.467
It's like she's living in a cage.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.513
She can blink, "yes..."

12:44.556 --> 12:46.766
she can blink, "no," but that's it.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.478
Now, we're not crazy.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.607
We just need a little bit of hope.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.195
I don't know what to tell you, Stan,
it's...

12:59.278 --> 13:00.322
It's irreversible.

13:00.405 --> 13:04.451
I can't candy coat it.
It's a slow... painful death.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.494
It's what it is, I'm sorry.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.417
Uh, I feel foolish driving up here.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.546
But, um... you're a doctor.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.256
I'd feel even more of a fool
if I didn't try.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.592
Sure, no, I'm... I'm glad you came up.

13:21.676 --> 13:26.514
Uh... why don't I, um, look into it,
see if there's any new research,

13:26.598 --> 13:29.351
or cutting edge things
coming out of Europe.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.894
They have less regulation than us,
you never know.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.732
We'd appreciate that.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.821
I'm glad you stopped by.
Stan, it's good to see you.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.782
I'll... I'll do whatever I can.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.596
-He took him.
-I didn't hear the gas.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.724
He took him upstairs.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.795
<i>Police say seven people were killed</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:30.383
<i>after a shooter opened fire inside</i>
<i>a shopping mall on Tuesday evening.</i>

17:30.466 --> 17:33.094
<i>Authorities are searching</i>
<i>for the suspected shooter,</i>

17:33.177 --> 17:35.137
<i>- whom they say left the scene...</i>

17:35.221 --> 17:36.681
<i>...before the police arrived.</i>

17:36.764 --> 17:38.307
<i>He was last seen walking towards...</i>

18:10.798 --> 18:13.759
Oh, so that's how they beat him?
The fucking Paleo Diet?

18:13.843 --> 18:16.763
You know, bad language
obscures rather than clarifies, Steven.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.472
Just tell us what's bothering you.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.142
Okay, OA eats a bird,
then Homer eats a starfish,

18:21.225 --> 18:22.476
and that's how they get the movements?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.103
Homer didn't eat a starfish.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.772
Look, which fish is not the issue.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.439
Well, it makes sense
if you just think about it.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.067
Oh, is this that invisible self shit?

18:30.151 --> 18:31.277
Swallow before you speak.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.613
I'm not on the lacrosse team.
I never learned to swallow.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.906
Okay, easy, boys.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.283
Okay, but what's Hap
gonna do to Homer?

18:37.366 --> 18:40.327
Well, we know Homer's alive,
'cause OA wants to find him.

18:40.411 --> 18:43.665
That doesn't mean he can't be,
like, brain damaged, or lose his legs.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.416
Or maybe this is it.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.169
When Homer gets trapped,
maybe it's the end of her story.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.257
Shit. I gotta go.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.259
You can't just drop a bomb like that
and cut out.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.012
No, I'm gonna be late
for practice again. See you guys later.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.854
Uh, French, hey...
Ready for the big night?

19:06.938 --> 19:07.939
Yeah.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.693
That's, um, that's quite
an interesting group you're sitting with.

19:12.609 --> 19:16.322
Hey, I sort of, uh, pride myself
on my high school anthropology.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.324
But for the life of me...

19:19.450 --> 19:21.953
I can't imagine
what the five of you have in common.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.872
Hey, man,
what happened to your head?

19:25.790 --> 19:28.334
Oh... it's nothing.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.961
-You sure? You okay?
-Yeah.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.587
Fine. Lacrosse.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.672
Yeah, 'course.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.590
See you at the scholarship dinner.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.516
How do you know what's right?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.642
What do you mean?

19:45.727 --> 19:50.439
Like, even just bringing this game,
it's kind of dangerous to make a mistake.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.776
Where do you find the confidence
to guide another person?

19:54.777 --> 20:00.282
It's just a combination of instinct
and training, like anything, I guess.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.039
Could life experience work like training?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.290
Yeah, over time.

20:08.374 --> 20:12.211
But you'd start out
making a ton of rookie mistakes.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.755
Nice and slow.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.299
You're training for something?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.886
You know I have a mission.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.596
Mmm.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.307
What makes you so sure
the FBI can't help with it?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.393
Can't help those other captives?

20:29.937 --> 20:30.980
They're gone.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.231
As in, passed?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.567
No, off the board.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.866
You worried the same thing
might happen to you?

20:42.449 --> 20:43.951
I want it to happen to me.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.038
Should I be worried, then?

20:47.121 --> 20:49.290
I don't want you taken off the board.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.963
The more days that pass here,

20:56.047 --> 20:57.298
the more I think
it couldn't have happened.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.009
Hey, I saw the medical reports, okay?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.469
Vitamin D deficiency,
dental decay, metal residue.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.930
Copper in those scars on your back?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.766
You did not imagine it.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.518
I couldn't have imagined love.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.231
Well, can I ask, is he or she
one of the captives you left behind?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.110
-He is.
-Okay, so let's accept, for a minute,

21:18.194 --> 21:20.905
your claim the FBI can't help him.
Does that mean you have to do it alone?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.532
Oh, I'm not alone.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.496
I wish I could sing.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.499
Can't carry a tune in a bag.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.417
Still, what do you do with a choir voice?

22:15.501 --> 22:19.505
I mean, career-wise, I mean,
we're all about industry here.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.801
Michigan's economy is ranked,
what, 13th in the nation now?

22:23.885 --> 22:24.886
Yes, sir.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.638
GM, Dow, Whirlpool.
Lot of potential for you there.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.056
Definitely.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.309
But, if I were you,
I'd look into politics.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.979
Situation with the demographic now?

22:35.062 --> 22:37.899
A smart kid like you,
put yourself right into the statehouse.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.400
-Thank you.
-I'd vote for ya!

22:39.483 --> 22:42.194
Thank you.
Um, could you excuse me for a second?

22:42.278 --> 22:44.363
Uh, sorry, I should really go see
where my mom is.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.697
And he loves his mama.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.784
Where do I sign the check?

22:52.829 --> 22:53.830
He's a good kid.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.422
Wine all over the place, carpet stained.

23:03.465 --> 23:07.094
Well, you...
Next time, you have to use Tide Ultra.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.430
- Tide?
- Yeah, it'll take it all out.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.556
- Tide Ultra?
- Mom.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.723
- Yeah!
- Tide?

23:11.807 --> 23:14.018
Mom.

23:14.101 --> 23:17.146
-Alfonso! Hi, baby.
-You missed half the dinner.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.272
People are starting to go.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.732
Okay, I'll go inside.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.194
I'm just enjoying my cigarette.
Okay? Go.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.861
I'm Chris. I'm Peyton's dad.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.493
Okay, say bye to your friends,

23:31.577 --> 23:34.121
and that fat teacher
who talked my ear off.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.710
I'm gonna grab my coat.
Can I get you anything?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.628
-Uh, yeah--
-No, she's fine.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.632
What is wrong with you?

23:45.716 --> 23:49.428
He's married, okay?
All the fucking dads here are married.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.098
Why're you telling me the fucking dads
are, like I am some child?

23:52.181 --> 23:54.016
No, you know,
this was supposed to be the one night.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.142
What?

23:55.226 --> 23:57.769
You want another medal?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.146
Mom...

23:59.230 --> 24:01.273
...I'm the one who has two jobs
because you can't work.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.733
-Mmm.
-But it's crazy to expect you

24:02.816 --> 24:05.486
to act like an adult for once. Just...

24:05.569 --> 24:08.280
What? Just what?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.865
I don't even know.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.575
I have worked so hard for this--

24:11.658 --> 24:14.370
Yes, you've worked so hard,

24:14.453 --> 24:18.124
but you do not know what life is, Alfonso.

24:19.083 --> 24:22.294
You don't know how hard it really gets.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.131
What, you don't think
I had dreams like yours?

24:25.214 --> 24:30.011
I lived in Paris, but I...
I'm here with you.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.471
Is that so bad?

24:35.099 --> 24:40.479
No, no. Listen, you are strong, yes.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.400
But you do not know everything, okay?

24:44.483 --> 24:47.486
You only see
what I haven't done.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.697
But what about what I have given you?

24:50.781 --> 24:52.699
What I have done?

24:52.783 --> 24:56.162
Giving you some kind of life
that can make this happen.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.332
Okay, I... I'm proud of you, yes.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.875
You got this medal, but...

25:02.334 --> 25:05.212
you don't need this
to be the man you will be.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.966
Okay? You will be the man
you will be no matter what.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.677
Okay?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.560
Buck, can you grab my bag?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.990
Come on. Can you stand?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.243
- Mmm.
- Come on.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.095
Are we the good guys, Buck?

26:38.472 --> 26:39.848
Yeah, what do you mean?

26:40.766 --> 26:43.519
I mean, even Hap was young
at some point.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.354
Like a doctor in some ER.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.191
And before that, he was a kid
in a medical school somewhere.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.154
And before that, probably played
in the high school band.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.157
What if, I don't know...

26:57.449 --> 26:58.659
we change?

26:59.701 --> 27:00.786
No...

27:01.703 --> 27:03.205
We won't change like that.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.999
No way.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.358
Hi, guys.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.319
Hey.

27:33.402 --> 27:37.448
<i>People who want power will always</i>
<i>try to control those who truly possess it.</i>

27:38.073 --> 27:40.033
Hap didn't know what was going on
in the basement,

27:40.116 --> 27:43.036
but he knew it was dangerous
to allow it to continue.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.415
It gave us strength, unity,

27:46.498 --> 27:48.542
and he knew Homer was the linchpin.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.464
What happens next is hard to hear.

27:53.547 --> 27:58.802
Because it's... hard to understand
how confusing freedom is

27:58.885 --> 28:01.054
when you've been a prisoner for so long,

28:01.137 --> 28:04.391
<i>how hard it is to grasp</i>
<i>that you have choice,</i>

28:04.475 --> 28:06.310
<i>that you can act,</i>

28:06.393 --> 28:10.647
<i>how unimaginable the sun is if you've</i>
<i>been living underground for years.</i>

28:10.731 --> 28:13.024
What?

28:14.109 --> 28:15.569
Where are we going?

28:20.241 --> 28:21.992
You're gonna help me with something.

28:32.294 --> 28:36.340
If anything happens to me,
your friends all die in the laboratory.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.508
They starve to death down there.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.009
So, bear that in mind.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.179
Oh, there's a microphone in your shirt.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.182
So, I'll be with you at every stage.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.936
Please don't talk too loudly.
You'll give me a headache.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.072
I'm in danger.
I'm in serious, serious danger.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.283
Please, just help. I need--
We need to call the police.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.953
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.372
Please hurry.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.554
<i>- Sí, sí.</i>
- No, no, no, no. No, no.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.889
Who are you calling? Who are you...

32:15.100 --> 32:17.185
They said you were having
some kind of breakdown.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.606
I told them about my son, of course.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.942
The golden boy with the brain damage
from the football injury.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.277
They're worried about you.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.281
Now, come on, Homer.
We're having a nice time, aren't we?

32:30.365 --> 32:34.077
All you have to do is convince her
to come up to your room.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.330
Then you can have a nice long sleep
with the window open

32:37.413 --> 32:39.374
and the ocean breeze blowing through.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.334
I'm gonna call--

32:41.417 --> 32:43.504
Who? Who you gonna call?

32:43.587 --> 32:46.465
-The FBI.
-And tell them what, exactly?

32:46.548 --> 32:48.383
That you keep us in a cellar.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.636
Where's that?

32:54.097 --> 32:55.265
A mine.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.683
An abandoned mine.

32:56.767 --> 32:57.934
-A mine.
-Yeah.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.352
That should be easy to find.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.896
Well, how many of them could there be?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.899
With that kind of dust, and those
kinds of trees? What, a hundred?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.610
Approximately 500,000 in North America.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.446
But the FBI, they would...
they would find them.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.407
They would search
all over the country in, like, 24 hours.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.867
No, less than 12 hours.

33:13.950 --> 33:17.078
They'd figure it out, they'd find you,
and... and they'd rescue them.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.830
You're a smart boy, Homer.

33:18.914 --> 33:19.998
Use your brain.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.167
The FBI are not coming to Cuba.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.920
They're not coming to get you
and they're not coming to get me.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.507
And if you somehow prevent me
from getting back there,

33:28.590 --> 33:31.927
you would starve Prairie
and all your friends to death.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.011
Is that what you want?

33:33.678 --> 33:35.722
-I can't hear you. Is that what you want?
-No.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.559
No. Me neither.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.563
So, turn around
and go and finish getting ready.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.690
Now.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.305
<i>Gracias.</i>

34:19.683 --> 34:20.767
Eat up. It's good.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.234
Here.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.363
There you go.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.756
Do you smoke?

34:52.758 --> 34:54.092
Try it.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.636
It'll calm you down.

34:58.304 --> 35:01.057
If you like it,
we can smoke cigars later.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.104
She's the one we're here for.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.399
She likes to dance on the veranda.

37:14.482 --> 37:18.486
After the evening is over,
you're gonna invite her up to your room.

37:19.946 --> 37:20.989
Me?

37:21.072 --> 37:25.160
<i>She likes handsome young men.</i>
<i>I'll do the rest.</i>

37:26.953 --> 37:28.997
So, how old are you, Homer?

37:34.294 --> 37:35.586
I'm not sure.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.008
Twenty-two?

37:40.967 --> 37:42.761
- Twenty-five?
- I'm not sure. I don't know.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.054
Maybe.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.808
Have you been to Cuba before?

37:49.517 --> 37:52.312
I've never even seen the ocean before.

37:54.397 --> 37:58.109
So much you don't know.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.196
Water?

38:05.658 --> 38:06.659
I'm sorry.

38:06.742 --> 38:09.830
Did you invite me up to this room
to seduce me?

38:10.872 --> 38:12.457
Or do you want to be seduced?

38:12.540 --> 38:14.250
Oh!

38:29.640 --> 38:31.226
You are trembling.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.186
Whoa!

38:34.938 --> 38:37.523
Hey, hey. Come... Come, come.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.996
What are you doing?
Don't worry about that.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.664
Shh, you should sleep.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.502
And I should go.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.711
Yeah.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.673
Something happened to you?

39:05.301 --> 39:06.469
Yes.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.722
A secret?

39:10.681 --> 39:12.058
Go. Please go.

39:12.142 --> 39:13.852
Please.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.770
I'm sorry. Just...

39:31.202 --> 39:35.373
They say at the bar that a crazy man
was running through the hotel earlier.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.878
Maybe they just thought he was crazy.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.630
Maybe he was just a prisoner
trying to break free.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.184
I'm a prisoner, too.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.270
Of this island.

41:43.293 --> 41:45.128
You taste like cold water.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.425
Say it again.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.430
<i>Say it again, Homer.</i>

41:56.055 --> 41:58.766
<i>What you said. You said I played like--</i>

41:58.849 --> 42:01.561
- <i>A maniac. A maniac.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

42:01.644 --> 42:03.938
- <i>You're a fucking maniac.</i>
<i>- Angel! Angel!</i>

42:04.022 --> 42:06.691
<i>Yes, yes. Fuck, yes!</i>

42:06.774 --> 42:08.734
<i>You're an angel.</i>

42:26.252 --> 42:27.628
He's alive.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.256
How can Homer do it?

42:30.340 --> 42:33.218
- How could he have done that to you?
- Relax, man.

42:33.301 --> 42:34.719
OA, what happens next?

42:34.802 --> 42:36.929
No, no. I would have never given in.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.681
He should have kept trying.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.395
Try to imagine what it's like

42:44.479 --> 42:46.689
to have been a prisoner
for all those years.

42:47.773 --> 42:50.193
You're not free just because
you can see the ocean.

42:50.276 --> 42:53.654
Captivity is a mentality.
It's a thing you carry with you.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.544
Hap succeeded.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.631
He broke the rebellion
by making Homer complicit

43:11.714 --> 43:13.299
in kidnapping Renata.

43:13.383 --> 43:16.469
He made us feel
we couldn't possibly be angels.

43:17.803 --> 43:19.222
We were too human.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.183
Fucking liar! I hate you!

43:23.309 --> 43:24.477
Scum of the Earth.

43:31.692 --> 43:32.902
OA.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.325
It isn't Homer that's doing this to us.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.410
It's him.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.291
You told us.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.753
You told us that we're down here
to find each other.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.381
To find out what we are.

43:55.508 --> 43:57.218
Maybe even Renata.

43:59.179 --> 44:00.596
You said we needed five.

44:01.556 --> 44:02.682
We're five.

44:03.599 --> 44:04.684
I was wrong.

44:05.726 --> 44:06.936
Look at me.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.647
OA, look at me.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.278
Fuck me!

44:22.285 --> 44:23.453
It's broken?

44:25.288 --> 44:28.374
My fucking luck.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.506
Listen...

44:35.590 --> 44:38.676
if he comes for me...
I ain't comin' back.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.347
I'm... I'm too sick.

44:52.147 --> 44:54.609
Hap, you know I won't survive
another round.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.362
I ain't no championship quarterback.

44:57.445 --> 44:58.488
You'll be fine.

44:58.571 --> 45:00.030
No. Don't, don't, don't.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.532
Please, just wait.

45:01.616 --> 45:05.202
I can tell you things.
I've got information.

45:05.286 --> 45:08.289
Look, uh, my fingers go in here?

45:09.206 --> 45:11.417
See? I ain't struggling.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.004
All right, it's your choice.

45:19.634 --> 45:21.135
What's that? What is that?

45:21.719 --> 45:22.762
It's gel.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.431
It makes the collar
slide nicely over your head.

45:25.515 --> 45:27.558
Keeps your hair in place.

45:27.642 --> 45:29.184
- Uh...
- All right.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.562
Head down.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.273
Lower.

45:37.568 --> 45:38.778
What information, Scott?

45:40.405 --> 45:43.240
You know they're trying to escape?

45:43.324 --> 45:44.534
Homer and Prairie.

45:45.410 --> 45:49.330
They're, uh... they're practicing these...
these movements.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.666
All night long, while you're asleep.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.545
Yeah, they were.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.339
She says it's gonna open up a...

45:58.423 --> 46:00.883
- ...a celestial door.
- Mmm-hmm.

46:00.966 --> 46:03.594
A portal that they can...
that they can escape through.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.432
She thinks they're angels.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.059
Is that right?

46:10.768 --> 46:12.520
Lean your head back. Chin down.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.229
Keep still. Stop talking.

46:21.571 --> 46:23.072
There we go.

46:28.202 --> 46:31.163
Look, I...
I gave you good information, right?

46:32.289 --> 46:36.293
I was thinking maybe you...
you skip the experiment and, uh,

46:36.377 --> 46:39.254
and send me back to my cell.

46:39.339 --> 46:42.592
Well... it is good information, Scott,

46:42.675 --> 46:45.928
but most important thing
we do here is the work.

46:46.011 --> 46:47.638
Collect the data.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.141
We're gonna change the world.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.479
And that's it.

47:01.736 --> 47:04.071
You... you think you know everything.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.032
Some fucking doctor you are.
Did you know she can see?

47:10.619 --> 47:13.122
Since her last NDE.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.541
Since you whacked her in the head.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.420
She's been playin' you for a fool.

47:22.382 --> 47:24.384
You broke their rebellion. You did.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.888
You broke him, and you broke her, too.

47:30.222 --> 47:33.893
You showed her
that he ain't nothin' but an animal.

47:35.019 --> 47:37.855
No, I changed my mind.
I want the gas! I want the gas!

47:39.649 --> 47:41.401
You know, just because
she doesn't love him

47:41.484 --> 47:43.360
doesn't mean she's ever
gonna love a monster like you.

47:44.487 --> 47:45.988
You know what she calls you?

47:46.572 --> 47:48.616
She calls you the "Angel Hunter."

48:02.755 --> 48:04.799
Oh!

48:04.882 --> 48:06.050
Oh, shit.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.384
Aah...

49:11.991 --> 49:13.576
You lied to me.

49:17.830 --> 49:19.289
You did this.

55:41.630 --> 55:43.883
You were right.

55:43.966 --> 55:45.008
There...

55:45.759 --> 55:47.427
there are movements.

55:48.929 --> 55:50.555
Five of 'em.

55:52.641 --> 55:55.644
And you need five people...

55:55.727 --> 55:57.312
at least.

55:57.396 --> 56:00.190
The movements, they...

56:00.274 --> 56:05.029
they do things we... cannot imagine.

56:06.488 --> 56:10.492
Five movements... open a...

56:10.575 --> 56:15.247
a tunnel to another dimension.

56:15.330 --> 56:17.332
Our freedom.

56:27.259 --> 56:29.553
I have the third movement.

57:21.521 --> 57:22.897
<i>Do you see now?</i>

57:24.024 --> 57:25.692
How we're going to save them?

57:26.818 --> 57:28.612
I'm gonna teach you the movements.

57:28.695 --> 57:30.655
All five of them.

57:30.739 --> 57:33.825
We're gonna open a tunnel into
another dimension. I will travel there...

57:35.494 --> 57:37.162
<i>and rescue them.</i>
