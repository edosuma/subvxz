Wait, wait, wait!
Stop! Stop. I need to stop.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.040
Nish!

00:55.040 --> 00:57.120
If they catch you,
they'll deport you.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.200
I-I can't.
You must.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.040
I can't.
Yes, you can.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.960
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on.

Ehi, vieni!

02:36.760 --> 02:39.960
Venite! Hanno trovato qualcosa.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.880
Andiamo.

02:41.880 --> 02:45.120

It's Wingfield.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.920
Well, good night, then.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.560
Good night.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.600
Come on, Nish. Where are you?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.960
I understand.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.200
No.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.200
You don't.

LIGHT CHATTER

07:39.360 --> 07:41.800
Buongiorno.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.560
Don't slip, my dear.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.040
Oh, Lady Latchmere, I do hope
that last night's hijinks

08:11.040 --> 08:12.360
didn't disturb you too much.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.720
No, no, no. They seemed to have
a much gayer evening than we did.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.920
I'm only sorry that Melissa
didn't stay behind.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.840
Don't look so surprised, my dear.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.840
I've decided to try and follow your
lead and become a little more...

08:25.840 --> 08:30.720
a little more modern in my outlook.
A little less judgemental, perhaps.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.120
For Ernest's sake.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.360
Come, come, my dear.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.800
We cannot blame the young
for trying to squeeze as much

08:40.800 --> 08:43.560
out of life as quickly as possible.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.800
Given the mess
that we've made of it all,

08:46.800 --> 08:50.040
who knows how long
they'll have to enjoy it?

08:50.040 --> 08:51.840
Rose?

08:53.400 --> 08:56.360
Rose?

08:56.360 --> 09:00.120
I was wondering where you'd got to.
Rose?

09:10.480 --> 09:12.880
Rose?
KNOCKING

09:12.880 --> 09:15.960
Er... occupied.
My apologies.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.040
Have you seen Rose?
Not since breakfast, no.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.080
Julia,
might I have a quick word with you?

09:27.080 --> 09:29.640
Of course. Please.
Oh.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.200
I must apologise.
Whatever for?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.240
For the unedifying spectacle
that greeted us

09:37.240 --> 09:38.760
on our return from supper
last night.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.440
They were in rather high spirits,
weren't they?

09:41.440 --> 09:42.840
They were drunk.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.400
I was rather glad
to see Rose having a lovely time.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.400
I was worried she was having
a dreadful time until now.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.520
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, no.

09:54.520 --> 09:58.120
I thought perhaps we should
talk about her and Lucian.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.600
But I'm speaking with Cecil
about all the arrangements.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.560
Yes, but there are...
other aspects to consider.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.240
Oh.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.720
You mean matters of the heart.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.960
Of course! Why not?

10:09.960 --> 10:11.960
How very sentimental of you.

10:11.960 --> 10:17.080
Is it sentimental to want your child
to be happy and settled?

10:17.080 --> 10:21.320
No. But it is to put happiness
above status and security.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.200
Yes, I...
Have I offended you?

10:25.200 --> 10:29.160
No, not at all.
I fear I have.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.280
I wondered if Rose was ready.
She's a year older than I was.

10:33.280 --> 10:40.000
Perhaps, but...
she seems very... young.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.880
Is there anything to be gained
from waiting?

10:44.480 --> 10:46.280
Perspective, perhaps.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.240
Time to see
if they are well matched.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.040
Is any of us well matched?

10:52.760 --> 10:55.360
You and I, Bella, of all people,

10:55.360 --> 10:58.560
we shouldn't pretend
that love ever trumps money

10:58.560 --> 11:00.680
when it comes to marriage.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.440
Oh.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.440
WAVES LAP

11:16.720 --> 11:19.840
Are you all right?
You look a bit peaky.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.360
I don't feel well.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.680
Well enough to come on
our boat trip, I hope.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.440
What boat trip?

11:29.440 --> 11:31.480
The one that we agreed upon
last night.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.240
Oh, Lucian, I can't.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.840
You can't or you won't?
What does it matter?

11:49.400 --> 11:52.360
You see, I know what it feels like
to live in constant fear

11:52.360 --> 11:53.920
of a parent's disapproval.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.760
My father finds faults
in almost everything that I do.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.840
Ever since I got... damaged.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.520
Sometimes it's like
he can't stand the sight of me.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.720
And my mother...

12:15.720 --> 12:18.360
tells me that I ought to stop
worrying about making him happy

12:18.360 --> 12:21.560
and start worrying about
making myself happy.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.640
I can't believe that Rose,

12:31.640 --> 12:34.080
the girl that I saw last night

12:34.080 --> 12:37.480
dancing with such
reckless abandon...

12:39.200 --> 12:42.760
..is too fearful to tell her mother

12:42.760 --> 12:45.800
that she wants to go on a boat trip
with her friends.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.880
I could ask.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.360
Go on.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.760
Lizzie, there you are.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.800
At least now I know
why you're feeling so beastly.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.720
Has someone been telling tales?
Only the bar bill.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.960
Listen, Lizzie?
Mm-hm.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.680
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just out with it.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.680
We're in trouble.

14:09.680 --> 14:14.320
Pelham, you always say that.
But this time I mean it.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.600
So, how bad is it?
Bad enough I can't pay the bill.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.440
The hotel bill?
The bar bill! Any of it.

14:20.440 --> 14:26.320
But your father gave you 500.
Not long ago. Where's it all gone?

14:27.680 --> 14:30.600
I lost it.
Lost it.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.720
I had a wager on myself
in Monte Carlo.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.000
Rather a sizeable one, I'm afraid.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.880
Well, can you ask him for more?

14:44.880 --> 14:48.440
I've already written to him, but
it's been ten days and not a peep.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.720
He'll come good.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.800
Not this time, I fear.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.240
So what are we going to do?

14:59.800 --> 15:02.000
I have a plan.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.120
But you may need to be ready
to leave. At short notice.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.280
When's the last time
you put a comb through that?

15:17.280 --> 15:18.680
Thank you.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.480
Smarten yourself up
before Mrs Ainsworth sees you.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.040
What's this?
Mrs Turner lent it me.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.120
What?
I hope you know what you're doing.

15:45.160 --> 15:49.320
And what does that mean?
It means be careful.

15:49.320 --> 15:54.480
Wearing a skimpy thing like that.
Now, you should know, of all people.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.400
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting nowt.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.520
You're saying it's my fault.
What happened to me.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.480
No. No, no, that's not what I said.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.240
But it's what you think.
You and the rest of them.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.040
I just don't want you
to get hurt again, Conny.

16:11.040 --> 16:16.240
I'm sick of it! Skulking around,
all buttoned up, living in fear.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.280
That what I do, or what I say,
or how I look...

16:20.680 --> 16:22.960
..gets taken the wrong way.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.000
I just want to let go.
It's just the way it is.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.120
Not for Mrs Turner, it's not.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.200
Oh, they'll soon
cut her down to size. You watch.

16:37.200 --> 16:42.120
Oh, don't listen to me, love.
I'm just a silly old fool

16:42.120 --> 16:44.840
who's forgotten
what it's like to be young.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.440
You're the wisest woman I know.
Oh.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.720
Get on with you. Go on.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.720
Go and enjoy yourself, Conny.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.760
Is that everything?
Yes, ma'am.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.440
Darling?
Hmm?

17:16.400 --> 17:21.800
Might Rose join you?
It certainly doesn't appear so.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.640
Ah.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.880
Perhaps Mrs Drummond-Ward
thinks you're a bad influence.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.560
Mm-hm. Me and everyone else.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.680
Take these.
Oh. Thank you.

17:33.680 --> 17:37.000
Well, at least you can give
some more attention to our guests.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.080
Will your husband be joining us,
Mrs Wingfield?

17:41.080 --> 17:46.080
He's lying low, I'm afraid. Saving
his strength for the big match.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.640
What about Mr Turner?

17:47.640 --> 17:49.760
Jack wouldn't be seen dead
on a boat.

17:49.760 --> 17:54.160
Then it seems Mr Albani and I
will have you all to ourselves.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.960
Have fun.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.080
Are we ready? Andiamo.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.960
Aren't you going to the ball,
poppet?

18:28.960 --> 18:33.320
Nobody thought to invite me, Daddy.
No-one ever does.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.840
Then start inviting yourself.
Put your best foot forward.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.520
You don't want to be the last
chicken on the shelf. Is that it?

18:39.520 --> 18:43.720
We all have to let our hair down
from time to time.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.880
I'm too old to go out gallivanting.
Gallivanting?

18:47.880 --> 18:51.960
You're 26, for heaven's sake.
And you know what they say.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.600
All work and no play.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.880
Or all play and no work,
in your case.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.200
Ah. I get quite enough of that
from your mother, if you don't mind.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.920
Oh, poor old Daddy.
Yes.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.440
Why poor old Daddy? What's...
He's feeling put upon.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.520
I'm merely trying to suggest to our
daughter that she might occasionally

19:07.520 --> 19:08.960
allow herself to have some fun.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.720
And I'm merely trying to suggest
that I'm too busy.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.320
Oh, darling.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.600
What brought all that on?

19:16.600 --> 19:18.760
She claims she's being overlooked.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.760
Well, perhaps it should be Alice
that you're trying to matchmake,

19:23.760 --> 19:25.480
rather than Lucian.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.120
What do you think?

19:31.640 --> 19:35.480
HE STAMMERS,
SIGHS

20:13.320 --> 20:15.960
LIVELY CHATTER

20:28.880 --> 20:31.520
Signora...
Buongiorno.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.040
SHE PROTESTS

20:35.160 --> 20:37.960
Signora Ainsworth!
Signor Danioni.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.640
What an honour. Coffee, perhaps?
No, thank you.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.880
I won't stay long enough
to drink it.

20:42.880 --> 20:48.080
A gift, from one... friend
to another.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.240
Thank you so much.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.880
That will be the last.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.200
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.920
You imagine
that I am a woman of means.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.840
But every penny I own
has been sunk into our hotel.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.880
I simply cannot afford
to keep paying you.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.440
Please don't try
to be clever with me.

21:12.440 --> 21:15.600
Now, listen carefully.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.440
You are a resourceful woman,
Signora.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.480
And I'm sure you will find
another way.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.600
You are a resourceful man.

21:27.640 --> 21:30.160
So will you.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.480
Good day.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.000
LOW CHATTER

24:04.120 --> 24:06.160
Come and have a look at this,
Mrs Wingfield.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.800
Stepping in all the right places.
If you look down there

24:09.800 --> 24:11.560
you can see winkle shells

24:11.560 --> 24:14.080
and also, if you're very careful,
sea urchins.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.400
Oh! Oh!

24:21.400 --> 24:23.560
Oh, you little devil!

24:30.840 --> 24:34.240
PLAYFUL CHATTER

25:18.240 --> 25:20.080
Leave me be, can't you?

25:50.680 --> 25:52.640
Ma che fai?
Don't you understand?

25:52.640 --> 25:57.000
That was a one-time thing. One time.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.880
What is this place?

26:21.880 --> 26:25.720
It belongs to my father.
Is he a farmer?

26:26.720 --> 26:29.520
He's a lawyer. And a landowner.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.880
He grows all this?
He rents it out.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.840
His tenants send him
half of what they harvest.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.120
A bit bourgeois, isn't it?

26:40.120 --> 26:43.920
My grandfather bought it
off the church, in the last century.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.600
I've pleaded with him
to give it away.

26:46.600 --> 26:50.360
And what does he say?
He calls me an anarchist.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.800
That's why I'm leaving.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.320
Leaving?

26:56.800 --> 26:58.840
We're not simpatici.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.000
He wants you to settle down.

27:12.920 --> 27:18.040
Where will you go?
Torino. I'm needed there.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.600
You're needed here.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.560
We must take the fight
to Mussolini in the cities.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.240
Perhaps you'll come too.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.760
What would I do in Turin?

27:47.760 --> 27:50.280
We'll learn to resist.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.360
Don't you think
you're being a touch hard on her?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.760
She behaved shamefully.
Yes, but I...

28:17.760 --> 28:21.080
I thought the general idea was
to bring the two of them together.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.480
Not at the cost of her good name.

28:23.480 --> 28:28.080
Besides, nothing's been agreed yet.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.080
Hasn't it?
Well, there's the question of money

28:32.080 --> 28:35.480
for one thing.
What did you have in mind?

28:35.480 --> 28:38.320
Well, there's Ivor's mother's house
in Bayswater.

28:38.320 --> 28:42.400
I rather thought they could have
the top two floors of that.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.120
And then the whole thing, over time.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.040
Oh.
Well, that's jolly decent of you.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.080
But then there's
the question of the wedding.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.960
And what they're going to live on,
of course.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.480
Yes, well, I'm...

28:53.480 --> 28:56.320
I'm hoping the boy will settle down
to some suitable employment.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.080
You can't run a household on hope.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.840
Of course not.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.240
Which is why I shall be happy
to give them an income.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.720
At least until
they get on their feet.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.760
Splendid. Have you decided how much?

29:10.760 --> 29:14.240
Not yet. I'm waiting.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.760
For a few things to...
you know, fall into place.

29:19.080 --> 29:22.920
To pluck up the courage to ask
your father-in-law, you mean?

29:22.920 --> 29:24.400
I wouldn't lower myself.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.360
I don't see why not.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.240
There has to be some advantage
to opening up your bloodline

29:30.240 --> 29:32.160
to the highest bidder.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.920
I do have other means
of raising money.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.920
Well, don't leave it too long.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.320
You don't want things
to get too far.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.520
Not until we know the price
we're both going to have to pay.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.760
You look busy, darling.
We made a profit on our tea party.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.440
No!
Next time it'll be bigger.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.840
Well, you are clever.
Oh, darling, this arrived for you.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.080
What happened to it?
I'm so sorry, I opened it.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.200
I didn't see
who it was addressed to.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.920
Darling...
I do hope you don't mind me saying,

30:20.920 --> 30:23.520
just while money is very tight,

30:23.520 --> 30:26.520
if you do have anything left over
from your widow's pension,

30:26.520 --> 30:29.680
or from the annuity
that George left you and Lottie,

30:29.680 --> 30:32.400
perhaps it should go back
into the running of the hotel.

30:32.400 --> 30:36.200
Rather than spending it
on jewellery.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.680
But I haven't.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.320
SHE GASPS

30:43.320 --> 30:46.120
I REALLY haven't.

30:52.040 --> 30:56.280
Oh, Carlo. Of course.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.440
Count Albani?
Yes.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.960
Oh, no.
Gosh.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.400
No.
Really?

31:05.400 --> 31:06.760
No.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.960
Stai benissimo.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.480
My, oh, my!
THEY CHEER

31:34.320 --> 31:37.040
Look out, world!

31:45.720 --> 31:47.440
Will you swim with me?

31:47.440 --> 31:50.640
Mm-hm.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.680
I thought you might
show me the cave.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.240
Of course.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.600
Shall we go in?

32:59.480 --> 33:04.040
Where did you learn how to swim?
Scarborough. In the summers.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.040
But it's nothing like this.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.720
What about you?
I learned in school.

33:09.720 --> 33:14.040
We had this terrible lake thing
that we called "the spinney."

33:14.040 --> 33:17.320
Is that where you learnt to draw?
At school?

33:17.320 --> 33:19.680
Well... Erm...

33:19.680 --> 33:22.280
No, I've always
just known how to do that.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.920
It's beautiful, isn't it?

33:30.920 --> 33:35.480
What would you call it?
Luminescent, I think.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.760
We should... We should go back.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.160
I'll race you!
Come back!

34:26.160 --> 34:28.600
I'm only resting my eyes.

34:29.720 --> 34:33.440
Count Albani.
Oh, my dear Mrs Mays-Smith.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.960
It is always a pleasure.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.920
May I assist you?
I cannot accept this.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.840
It's a lovely thing.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.120
Exquisite, even.

34:47.120 --> 34:50.160
But... inappropriate.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.640
I'm sorry to hear you think so.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.200
I would be taking it
under false pretences.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.880
I understand your... sensibilities.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.760
I will convey them to Roberto.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.360
Roberto?
Yes.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.160
It is he who commissioned
this gift for you.

35:19.160 --> 35:24.160
As a token of our... his admiration.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.720
For you and your family.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.080
I would be most obliged.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.720
I've been on at him for ages.
To give it up.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.600
Losing is so bad
for his self-esteem.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.160
Men and their egos.

36:03.160 --> 36:08.160
They're such children. Pelham
can sulk for days. Weeks, even.

36:08.160 --> 36:11.600
Over a stupid tennis match.
They're all the same.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.640
Yes, well, I'm beyond caring,
to be honest.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.800
You know, I'd be happy to leave him
to stew in his own juices,

36:18.800 --> 36:23.240
if he'd only pull himself together
long enough to give me what I want.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.480
And what would that be?

36:25.480 --> 36:27.560
A damned baby!

36:29.720 --> 36:34.640
Been trying long, honey?
We're barely trying at all.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.680
He shows no bloody interest.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.040
You're right, men are babies. But...

36:45.040 --> 36:48.720
..with a bit of pampering
and cajoling,

36:48.720 --> 36:51.800
we can teach them to behave
the way that we want.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.080
Mm?
Yeah.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.080
SHE GASPS

37:18.640 --> 37:21.120
I'm sorry.

37:39.960 --> 37:43.080
Bellakins.
Yes?

37:43.080 --> 37:45.120
Do we have any Champagne
in the cellar?

37:45.120 --> 37:49.080
Um... I kept behind a crate or two.
But why?

37:49.080 --> 37:51.200
Be a good girl and crack open
a bottle or three?

37:51.200 --> 37:54.400
Oh, no. Darling, we can't afford
to drink it ourselves.

37:54.400 --> 37:58.080
Ah! Not even if we're celebrating?

37:58.080 --> 38:01.160
What do we have to celebrate?

38:01.160 --> 38:04.480
Let me show you.
Cecil...

38:10.200 --> 38:12.360
LOW CHATTER

38:13.880 --> 38:17.160
Ancora bicchieri. Grazie.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.560
What's happening here?

38:19.560 --> 38:21.880
Your father's about to make
an announcement.

38:21.880 --> 38:25.200
He's...?
Not that one, darling.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.760
What, then?
He wants to tell you himself.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.320
DINGING

38:35.880 --> 38:39.040
Alice, hold it.
Er, thank you, everybody,

38:39.040 --> 38:41.520
for joining us
at this slightly earlier hour.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.520
I promise I shan't keep you
from your dinner.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.880
Now, I have to confess,

38:45.880 --> 38:50.400
when it comes to art,
I'm a bit of a Philistine.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.320
I mean, I enjoy a good cartoon
in Punch as much as the next man,

38:53.320 --> 38:55.240
but that's the end of it.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.000
I'd prefer to leave the enjoyment
of the finer things in life

38:58.000 --> 38:59.480
to my wife and son here.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.040
And the rest of the Ainsworth clan
are equally lacking

39:02.040 --> 39:05.640
in aesthetic sensibility, so
it shouldn't surprise you to learn

39:05.640 --> 39:08.800
that we've had a quite extraordinary
artefact hanging in our midst

39:08.800 --> 39:12.520
for nearly half a century, without
having the foggiest idea about it.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.880
Now, as luck would have it, I've
recently made a new acquaintance.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.800
A new friend, I should say.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.960
A man who does know his art
from his elbow. Take a bow, Jack!

39:25.280 --> 39:30.360
Now, Jack Turner here is not just
a connoisseur, he's a man of action.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.720
You see, it's taken my brother and I
a lifetime to realise

39:32.720 --> 39:34.480
we own a masterpiece,

39:34.480 --> 39:37.880
but it's taken Jack a jiffy to bring
his man up here to authenticate it.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.680
So...

39:39.680 --> 39:41.920
with a letter in my hand
to prove it,

39:41.920 --> 39:45.160
it gives me very great pleasure
to present

39:45.160 --> 39:51.360
a previously unidentified work by
the Old Master, Peter Paul Rubens.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.360
My word.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.080
Quite something, isn't she?

40:08.080 --> 40:10.880
This is what's going to stop you
going cap in hand

40:10.880 --> 40:12.840
to Old Man Livesey.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.480
Jack says that we shouldn't settle
for a penny less

40:15.480 --> 40:16.840
than a hundred thousand.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.240
One hundred thousand?

40:28.960 --> 40:32.760
Are you still on for tonight, honey?
Very much so.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.720
Ten thirty?
First floor bathroom.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.800
Mm-hm.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.200
Bring every weapon in your armoury.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.800
The composition is so... dramatic.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.360
Yet with such delicacy
at the same time.

40:50.360 --> 40:54.480
Just look at the skin tone.
It's almost...

40:54.480 --> 40:56.280
Luminescent.

41:03.200 --> 41:07.440
She's rather...
Exposed.

41:07.440 --> 41:11.560
That's one way of putting it.
Not to your taste, Aunt?

41:11.560 --> 41:15.040
I feel nudity is something that
I'll never grow accustomed to.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.640
Are you going to let him hang it?

41:25.120 --> 41:28.000
Good heavens, no.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.520
It would clash with the decor.

41:35.160 --> 41:39.640
Proprio come piacciono a me.
No, le preferisco con meno muscoli.

41:39.640 --> 41:44.400
Piu femminili.
Quanto pensate che valga questo?

41:44.400 --> 41:46.120
Centomila sterline.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.560
Dicono.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.760
What a stroke of luck, Danioni.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.640
That you were here
for the grand unveiling.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.560
Most fortunate.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.960
And what brings you this way?

42:05.960 --> 42:09.200
I just want to return you this.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.360
Oh. Where did you find it?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.640
It was recovered from a bicycle.

42:13.640 --> 42:18.280
Left at an illegal gathering held
by enemies of the Italian state.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.480
HE STAMMERS

42:19.480 --> 42:21.160
Do you have any idea
how it got there?

42:21.160 --> 42:24.600
Of course, yeah.
One of the undesirables we arrested.

42:24.600 --> 42:28.720
He has confessed
to stealing the bicycle

42:28.720 --> 42:32.360
at request of, er...

42:34.800 --> 42:37.800
..William Scanlon.
Billy, you say.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.560
Why, the little blighter.
Yeah.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.120
He's fallen in
with criminal elements now.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.120
Oh, God!

42:46.120 --> 42:50.760
And what exactly
are you proposing to do about it?

42:50.760 --> 42:53.560
Well, I will leave that to you.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.600
Thank you, Signore.
That's jolly decent of you.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.040
Absolutely.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.680
Oh. How stupid of me.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.320
I forgot. There is also this.

43:17.240 --> 43:20.120
Where did you get this?
It was found in the street.

43:20.120 --> 43:23.520
But... it's been opened.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.120
This is a private correspondence
from my wife.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.840
I fear so, yeah.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.200
No, no, no.
To her father's accountant.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.960
I've no head for sums, I'm afraid.
I leave all that to her.

43:33.960 --> 43:38.360
Yeah. Well, I think a man should
always be across his wife's affairs,

43:38.360 --> 43:39.880
Signor Ainsworth.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.120
Ah, Ainsworth! There you are.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.920
So I...

43:44.920 --> 43:46.960
Hi.

43:48.760 --> 43:53.000
Shall we?
Yes. Of course. Do excuse me.

44:06.320 --> 44:10.360
Mr Sengupta.
Thank you, Billy.

44:10.360 --> 44:12.360
What is it?

44:34.640 --> 44:37.520
Who gave you this?

44:37.520 --> 44:41.760
A friend.
I were asked to pass it on.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.880
Was that all?

44:45.800 --> 44:47.200
There's summat else.

44:53.360 --> 44:57.720
I were told to tell you
to bring these when you come.

45:03.720 --> 45:07.640
I don't suppose you read Italian.
Not a word.

45:07.640 --> 45:11.120
But I can tell they don't say
owt nice about Old Musso.

45:13.120 --> 45:15.880
You're not gonna
leave them there, are you?

45:15.880 --> 45:19.480
That's jail time if you're caught.
What am I supposed to do with them?

45:22.280 --> 45:25.600
I could hide them for you.
For a price.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.320
Sorry, Mr Sengupta.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.520
What are you skulking about
down here for?

45:38.520 --> 45:40.520
What have you got there?
Nowt for nosey.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.320
I don't know what
this has got to do with Mr Sengupta,

45:47.320 --> 45:49.320
but I do know
you're asking for trouble.

45:49.320 --> 45:53.600
Not if you don't tell on me.
Well, you can't leave them here.

45:53.600 --> 45:58.000
Mrs Ainsworth and Mr Ainsworth,
they're up and down here all day.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.200
I'm gonna hide them
under Lady Latchmere's bed.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.720
Whilst they're all busy with dinner.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.400
Keep your hair on.
No-one will look for them there.

46:30.960 --> 46:35.120
So you liked it, then?
The painting?

46:37.440 --> 46:38.640
Yes.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.760
To think he painted her
more than 300 years ago,

46:43.760 --> 46:47.640
and yet it seems so... fresh.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.760
Well, you have a good eye.

46:49.760 --> 46:53.320
Well, I've never really seen
a painting like that before.

46:53.320 --> 46:57.240
At leastways, not so close up
as I could touch it.

46:57.240 --> 47:00.120
That's not the only thing
that you saw close up today.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.840
I'm sorry that you had to be...
exposed to that.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.160
You have nothing to apologise for.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.440
It must have repulsed you.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.480
It took my breath away.

47:25.360 --> 47:30.440
It made me yearn to know what you
must have been through to get it.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.960
And what it must be like
to carry it still.

47:32.960 --> 47:36.320
To be scarred for life, you mean.

47:36.320 --> 47:38.280
We all have scars.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.240
I saw none on you today.

47:44.640 --> 47:47.760
I looked and looked.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.400
And there were no imperfections.

48:18.880 --> 48:23.360
Ah. Excellent. Are we OK to... talk?

48:23.360 --> 48:25.040
He doesn't understand a word.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.200
Well, will this do?

48:29.200 --> 48:32.920
I'd say $50,000
would do very nicely.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.120
Uh-huh.
Let's just hope she sells.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.720
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

48:36.720 --> 48:39.360
The only real question
is for how much.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.600
Yeah.

48:44.600 --> 48:47.200
Should I keep her locked up in here
until your man gets back?

48:47.200 --> 48:51.440
Ah. No, no. I'd prefer to keep
the lady with me. If you don't mind.

48:51.440 --> 48:54.760
You're quite sure
she'll be safe with you?

48:54.760 --> 48:57.600
Oh, yeah.
She'll be well protected.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.880
I see. Then take her away.
Francesco?

49:01.880 --> 49:05.560
Oh, but, er... do come back down
for a glass of brandy and a cigar.

49:05.560 --> 49:07.480
I hate to drink alone.
Of course.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.840
OK. Let's go.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.000
KNOCK AT DOOR

49:25.960 --> 49:29.040
Now just... set it down over here.
That's it.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.560
Terrific. Thanks, Francesco.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.320
Thank you.

49:43.960 --> 49:46.520
Don't let anyone in, baby.

49:46.520 --> 49:50.360
And I want you to stay put yourself,
all right?

49:50.360 --> 49:52.280
I won't be long.

49:59.440 --> 50:02.520
'Last Dance In Paris'
by Anders Johan Greger Lewen

50:08.680 --> 50:13.000
If I have two pairs
of the same number, is that OK?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.520
Can I put them down?
Yes, just in twos.

50:15.520 --> 50:18.280
Mr Albani?
Buonasera.

50:18.280 --> 50:22.040
Are you looking for your father?
Scusi?

50:22.040 --> 50:25.680
Oh, tuo padre?
Si.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.600
I think he's upstairs. Sleeping.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.840
Con permesso.
Roberto.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.440
I just wanted to say thank you.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.800
To say grazie. For the bracelet.

50:42.800 --> 50:48.360
It was very beautiful and a very
thoughtful and generous gift.

50:48.360 --> 50:50.840
I hope you can understand
why I had to refuse.

50:50.840 --> 50:56.400
But that doesn't mean I'm not...
grateful for the interest.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.800
HE WHISTLES

51:19.720 --> 51:22.120
You sent back a gift!

51:22.120 --> 51:24.440
I couldn't accept it.
Because he's Italian?

51:24.440 --> 51:26.480
Because I thought it was
from the Count.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.800
From the Count?
Yes.

51:28.800 --> 51:31.880
But it was from... from Roberto.
Yes.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.640
Oh, poor man.
He doesn't speak a word of English.

51:35.640 --> 51:38.160
Perhaps he needs his father
to speak on his behalf.

51:38.160 --> 51:41.800
Perhaps.
Oh, you won!

51:41.800 --> 51:45.640
You sent back a gift!
That's so scandalous!
