WEBVTT

00:02.295 --> 00:05.992
Emerson, please.
Figure it out for yourself.

00:06.166 --> 00:08.430
It's just an omelet.

00:08.602 --> 00:12.265
Well, just choose any kind you like.
Pick one.

00:12.439 --> 00:14.270
Pick one.

00:14.708 --> 00:17.609
- Okay. Use Velveeta.
- Good choice.

00:18.812 --> 00:21.302
I mean, from a melting standpoint.

00:22.649 --> 00:25.743
Emerson, I've got to go.
I'll see you later.

00:26.019 --> 00:27.815
How is your fiancé?

00:27.987 --> 00:29.648
Helpless.

00:30.357 --> 00:33.155
But then, most men are.

00:33.493 --> 00:36.086
Remember you're being interviewed
by that reporter...

00:36.262 --> 00:38.390
...from the law journal
during the lunch break.

00:38.565 --> 00:41.227
Lana, are you okay?
You look kind of...

00:41.401 --> 00:44.130
- Peaked?
- Yeah, and mealy.

00:46.673 --> 00:49.436
- Mealy?
- Kind of gamy.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.774
Look, I'm sick, all right?

00:55.482 --> 00:57.346
For your information, it's just a virus.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.916
My doctor gave me a prescription,
and I'll be fine.

01:00.085 --> 01:03.749
Well, good, then take your medicine,
take the night off, go home and go to bed.

01:03.923 --> 01:06.756
- Hi, everybody.
- I cannot do you any good in bed.

01:06.926 --> 01:09.292
No man's gonna buy that.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.698
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.663
He bought it.

01:15.834 --> 01:17.096
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, judge.

01:17.269 --> 01:20.238
I just need a copy of the calendar,
and I'll be trotting along.

01:20.406 --> 01:21.964
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22.141 --> 01:23.870
Here it is.

01:25.611 --> 01:27.670
Did he hit you?

01:29.748 --> 01:32.308
Look, I know I look awful,
but it's just a little bug.

01:32.484 --> 01:35.783
I'm under medication,
and I'll be just fine.

01:36.655 --> 01:39.249
- We're all set out there.
- Okay.

01:40.025 --> 01:42.516
You lost someone close.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.261
I'm sorry.

01:46.432 --> 01:50.231
Lana is just feeling a little
under the weather tonight, Bull.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.893
I always choose natural fabrics.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.904
Now, a good alpaca
is a lifetime investment.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.010
Oh, I must jot that down.

01:59.178 --> 02:01.271
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Selma.

02:01.447 --> 02:03.937
- Greetings.
- Hi, Dan.

02:04.115 --> 02:05.946
Good God.

02:07.319 --> 02:09.946
All right. That's it. I've had it.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.557
Once again,
for everybody's information...

02:13.725 --> 02:16.354
...I am sick with a virus.
I am under a doctor's care.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.394
No matter how I look,
I am well enough to perform my duties...

02:19.564 --> 02:24.024
...as a clerk of this court.
Do I make myself clear?

02:29.307 --> 02:31.901
- I understand her.
- I pity her.

02:32.076 --> 02:34.271
I touched her.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.492 --> 03:24.790
Slow down.

03:24.961 --> 03:26.725
I feel great. Thanks.

03:26.898 --> 03:29.229
Whatever the medication is,
it seems to be working.

03:29.399 --> 03:32.766
I don't feel so drained anymore.
You know, I feel vigorous...

03:32.936 --> 03:35.098
...like I could ride my bike
around the park.

03:35.273 --> 03:39.766
You know, my doctor made me
get one of those exercise bicycles.

03:39.943 --> 03:41.934
Does it have one of those
machines on it...

03:42.112 --> 03:44.512
...that measures your blood pressure
and pulse rate?

03:44.681 --> 03:46.080
Used to, but I took it off.

03:47.851 --> 03:51.218
- Why?
- Make room for the ashtray.

03:54.991 --> 03:56.549
All set, Your Honor.

03:56.726 --> 03:58.853
What's it look like tonight?

03:59.830 --> 04:03.197
The guy in the dress
wants another strip search.

04:08.438 --> 04:10.906
- What a sickie.
- Yeah.

04:11.074 --> 04:14.406
I mean, gloves with a cocktail dress?

04:15.912 --> 04:17.903
First case, Emil Dutton, Your Honor.

04:18.081 --> 04:20.605
- Well, you're looking good.
- I know.

04:21.916 --> 04:24.682
In case you didn't. Call Emil Dutton.

04:27.156 --> 04:29.556
- Bring that clown in here.
- Bull!

04:31.161 --> 04:33.994
Let's not forget that everyone
that comes before this court...

04:34.164 --> 04:36.028
...is due a certain amount of respect.

04:36.198 --> 04:40.033
And I will not tolerate you
referring to anyone as a clown.

04:45.407 --> 04:48.377
Unless, of course,
they are, in fact, a clown.

04:49.645 --> 04:51.875
- Explanation?
- Emil Dutton, Your Honor.

04:52.047 --> 04:53.947
Alias, Mr. Froufrou.

04:55.051 --> 04:58.349
Charged with gambling,
disorderly conduct, inciting a riot...

04:58.521 --> 05:02.287
...attempted assault, attacking an officer
and resisting arrest.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.153
What, no lewd behavior?

05:04.426 --> 05:06.519
I was too drunk.

05:07.863 --> 05:09.160
Mr. Prosecutor?

05:09.331 --> 05:13.768
Your Honor, several witnesses,
assorted photographs. The state rests.

05:14.737 --> 05:16.102
Any defense, Miss Williams?

05:16.472 --> 05:19.771
- Tell them what we got, baby.
- Shut up.

05:20.342 --> 05:24.108
You're disgusting,
and I'm disgusted to have to defend you.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.875
Check me later and I'll show you
why all the world loves a clown.

05:30.186 --> 05:32.120
Your Honor, if there were a reduction...

05:32.287 --> 05:36.054
...my client would consider pleading guilty
to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.

05:36.225 --> 05:40.422
May I submit that this man is more in need
of our help than our punishment.

05:40.595 --> 05:43.759
- Is that your best shot?
- Stick it, Bozo.

05:45.734 --> 05:49.760
Your Honor, the state does not feel
compelled to bargain with this...

05:49.938 --> 05:53.397
...fallen idol of children everywhere.

05:53.909 --> 05:57.309
Spare me. If the little creeps
want an idol, I won't disappoint them.

05:57.478 --> 06:01.710
Let them suck on a George Washington
or lvanhoe, somebody dead.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.147
I find your attitude a little unbelievable.

06:04.319 --> 06:07.653
I mean, according to your file,
you've been a circus clown for 15 years.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.414
It's a job.

06:09.591 --> 06:13.152
A job? You call delighting children,
inspiring glee...

06:13.328 --> 06:16.855
...and tickling young fancies a job?

06:18.333 --> 06:20.164
Who the hell is that?

06:21.102 --> 06:23.696
My court clerk. Miss Wagner...

06:23.871 --> 06:27.238
...as a student of decorum,
I'm sure you realize that your remarks...

06:27.408 --> 06:30.570
...were ill-timed and highly irregular.

06:31.846 --> 06:33.313
Why, you're right.

06:33.481 --> 06:34.914
I'm sorry.

06:35.083 --> 06:39.543
I don't know why...
I mean... Please forgive me!

06:41.256 --> 06:44.157
- There's something wrong with her.
- No kidding.

06:44.325 --> 06:48.386
My roommate in law school acted like that
once. Turned out to be rabies.

06:49.564 --> 06:52.464
- Well, what happened to him?
- He died.

06:52.666 --> 06:55.066
He started chasing sports cars,
and he was run over.

06:57.472 --> 07:00.838
I'm kidding. He died of the rabies.

07:01.642 --> 07:05.079
Excuse me. I hate to break up
your little party...

07:05.246 --> 07:07.338
...but can we get on with this?
I gotta sleep.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.414
I got a seltzer seminar in the morning.

07:09.883 --> 07:14.149
They got a new pump on the market.
Lets you hit a man in the face at 30 feet.

07:14.955 --> 07:16.183
What a breakthrough.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.922
Anything for a laugh.

07:19.159 --> 07:21.787
Lana seems to be doing better.
Let's finish this one up.

07:21.962 --> 07:24.624
Then we'll take a break,
and I'll get her to lie down.

07:24.798 --> 07:27.859
Miss Wagner, can I have
the disposition reports, please?

07:28.036 --> 07:29.730
Sure.

07:30.871 --> 07:32.361
Here.

07:34.775 --> 07:36.936
- She's flipped out.
- Yeah.

07:37.110 --> 07:41.046
I'll take her to my chambers. Arrange
for another clerk. We'll pick up after lunch.

07:41.214 --> 07:44.012
Got it. Listen, are you sure
you can handle her by yourself?

07:44.284 --> 07:46.309
Staple fight!

07:48.588 --> 07:51.614
She's gotta reload sooner or later.

07:52.492 --> 07:54.892
That's lunch, everybody.

07:55.996 --> 07:57.963
The place is a circus.

07:58.130 --> 08:00.258
That's for sure.

08:01.201 --> 08:03.294
Great seats, though.

08:06.372 --> 08:08.102
What's going on?

08:08.275 --> 08:10.436
Your trial has been postponed
till after lunch.

08:10.610 --> 08:13.373
What happened to my right
to a speedy trial?

08:13.846 --> 08:17.010
Dutton, if you're inconvenienced,
I'm glad.

08:17.184 --> 08:20.516
You have defiled the image
of what a clown is supposed to be.

08:20.686 --> 08:26.454
A symbol of childish innocence,
simple spirit, ingenuous fun.

08:28.494 --> 08:29.893
Is that what you had in mind?

08:36.902 --> 08:40.236
- Well, what is it?
- I'm gonna call your doctor. You are sick.

08:40.407 --> 08:43.807
Sick? I'm feeling wonderful.

08:43.976 --> 08:46.604
I'm having wonderful feelings.

08:46.779 --> 08:51.580
"Barefoot in the park" feelings,
"soaring on a swing" feelings...

08:51.751 --> 08:54.686
..."first time in my life" feelings.

08:55.154 --> 08:57.019
That's sick.

08:58.090 --> 09:01.025
- You're sweet, you know that?
- Yeah, I know that.

09:01.193 --> 09:05.289
- You're a humanist.
- Okay, I'm a sweet humanist.

09:06.065 --> 09:08.625
- Let's call somebody.
- Like my fiancé, Emerson.

09:08.801 --> 09:11.291
- Good choice.
- No, I'm too happy.

09:13.372 --> 09:15.203
Happiness just worries Emerson.

09:15.374 --> 09:17.398
It's only temporary.
He's gonna understand.

09:17.575 --> 09:20.477
Oh, of course he'll understand.
Emerson understands everything.

09:20.646 --> 09:24.206
Emerson understands computers,
foreign policy...

09:24.382 --> 09:27.215
...the international money market.

09:27.485 --> 09:29.215
He's not like you.

09:29.588 --> 09:31.612
No, I took a beating in pesos.

09:32.857 --> 09:34.722
Just kidding.

09:35.895 --> 09:38.625
That's what's so great about you,
you know. You can kid.

09:38.797 --> 09:40.560
You can joke.

09:40.732 --> 09:42.996
You understand people.

09:43.168 --> 09:46.035
Their wants, their needs...

09:46.204 --> 09:48.365
...their desires.

09:54.913 --> 09:58.542
Well, how about that
Middle East situation, huh?

10:08.560 --> 10:10.892
No. Let me guess.

10:12.864 --> 10:15.525
This isn't what it appears to be.

10:16.234 --> 10:18.293
Oh, yes, it is!

10:25.176 --> 10:28.475
Yes, doctor, she took them
about an hour ago.

10:29.147 --> 10:30.704
Bizarre behavior?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.955
That would not be
too strong a term, no.

10:40.124 --> 10:42.354
Right. Right. Yeah, of course.

10:42.527 --> 10:45.984
We will not let her operate
any heavy machinery. Right.

10:46.163 --> 10:49.258
Okay. All right, thank you, doctor.
Goodbye.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.234
- Was it the medication?
- Well, apparently so.

10:52.436 --> 10:54.700
According to the doctor,
in certain individuals...

10:54.872 --> 10:57.774
...it causes "insomnia,
drowsiness, restlessness...

10:57.942 --> 11:01.968
...euphoria, depression
or a change of libido."

11:02.145 --> 11:06.639
- What does it cure?
- Apparently the fear of imitating an ape.

11:06.850 --> 11:09.683
I can see the Chrysler Building
from here.

11:09.853 --> 11:11.650
Eventually, you're gonna be...

11:11.822 --> 11:14.586
- Hello?
- Company!

11:14.958 --> 11:18.394
Hi. I'm looking for
Judge Harold T. Stone.

11:18.562 --> 11:21.258
- I'm Judge Stone.
- Hi. Steven Bostwick from the law review.

11:21.698 --> 11:27.432
Stevie! Hi! Lana Wagner!
Talked to you on the phone, remember.

11:28.205 --> 11:30.901
Look, if I'm interrupting something,
perhaps I could...

11:31.074 --> 11:34.237
No, no, don't be silly.
We're just doing a little redecorating.

11:34.411 --> 11:38.677
Let's get your opinion. Don't you think
she'd look better over the desk?

11:39.850 --> 11:43.148
- I beg your pardon.
- You're gonna have to excuse us.

11:43.319 --> 11:46.084
We have a small medical problem
on our hands.

11:47.524 --> 11:49.582
Somebody sick?

11:50.560 --> 11:53.462
- Where do you want it?
- Anywhere, please.

11:54.064 --> 11:56.964
Lana, why don't you and I
go get a cup of coffee...

11:57.133 --> 12:00.399
...and let the judge do his interview.
- No. He said I could stay.

12:00.571 --> 12:04.233
I deserve it. I booked the appointment.
I rearranged the court schedule.

12:04.407 --> 12:06.671
I brought in the soft drinks.

12:06.842 --> 12:08.674
Orange or grape, Bostwick?

12:09.513 --> 12:12.606
- Lana.
- Well, what is it?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.280
Okay, you can stay.

12:15.451 --> 12:19.182
The doctor said to keep her quiet
for a couple of hours and it would wear off.

12:19.355 --> 12:22.347
- You can all go to lunch. We'll be okay.
- Lf you're sure.

12:22.525 --> 12:24.994
Come on. Harry knows best.

12:25.395 --> 12:28.261
- Take care.
- Yeah. Thanks.

12:29.098 --> 12:30.326
Shall we all have a seat?

12:30.499 --> 12:33.662
If this isn't a good time,
I'd be more than happy to reschedule it.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.565
He said, sit down!

12:39.108 --> 12:45.513
Miss Wagner, if you are going to stay,
you have to sit there quietly and just...

12:45.681 --> 12:47.807
...sit there quietly.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.883
That's what Emerson wants.

12:51.621 --> 12:53.555
- Emerson?
- Her fiancé.

12:53.723 --> 12:58.023
"Sit there quietly."
It's hard to sit quietly.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.095
I mean, statistics show that right now
I'm at my sexual peak.

13:02.263 --> 13:04.163
- We're off the record here.
- You know...

13:04.333 --> 13:08.702
...I think that we all need a little adventure
every now and then, don't you think so?

13:08.871 --> 13:11.100
Well, we're having one now, aren't we?

13:11.272 --> 13:15.676
You know, sometimes Emerson
is very cooperative.

13:16.078 --> 13:19.410
- Maybe I should...
- No, no. I mean, don't get me wrong.

13:19.581 --> 13:23.984
Emerson has his good points, you know.
He's practical. He's dependable. He's safe.

13:24.152 --> 13:26.643
Emerson's a Volvo.

13:29.659 --> 13:33.560
Perhaps this is something you should be
talking to Emerson about.

13:33.728 --> 13:37.563
I can't talk to Emerson,
not after what you did to me.

13:38.099 --> 13:41.227
- I didn't do anything to you.
- You kissed me.

13:41.403 --> 13:45.067
- No, you kissed me.
- Sure, after you practically begged for it.

13:46.241 --> 13:50.769
Lana, because of your condition,
I am trying my best not to lose my temper.

13:50.945 --> 13:54.108
- Well, what are we gonna do about it?
- Do about what?

13:54.282 --> 13:58.378
- This thing that's happening.
- No thing is happening!

14:00.655 --> 14:03.749
You used me!

14:04.292 --> 14:05.384
Lana!

14:05.560 --> 14:09.997
A little afternoon delight with the help
and then forget it, eh, Harry?

14:10.165 --> 14:11.223
Listen, I'm very sorry.

14:11.399 --> 14:13.629
Why apologize to him?
You should apologize to me.

14:13.802 --> 14:17.260
I mean, I'm the one that got hurt.
You never liked me!

14:17.439 --> 14:21.273
- I like you, Lana!
- Oh, you never did!

14:21.443 --> 14:22.932
I was just...

14:23.110 --> 14:25.272
...office equipment.

14:27.248 --> 14:30.375
- I hate men!
- Me too.

14:31.318 --> 14:34.777
- Hi, Selma. Nice suit.
- Thanks.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.755
"Don't move to New York,"
my mother said.

14:37.925 --> 14:40.827
"It's full of heartbreakers
and degenerates."

14:41.429 --> 14:44.659
I haven't worn underwear
since the late '60s.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.329
I bet your lungs are disgusting too.

14:49.804 --> 14:51.327
- Lana, hold up.
- Hey.

14:51.672 --> 14:54.038
She threw my cigarette on the floor.

14:55.409 --> 14:57.310
Probably one of these.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.777
- I respected you, Harry Stone.
- I respect you too, Lana.

15:00.948 --> 15:04.908
You would've been a good father.
I know I would've been a good mother.

15:05.085 --> 15:10.022
I want children, lots of them. My doctor
says that I'm built to have children.

15:10.190 --> 15:12.521
I envy you.

15:14.094 --> 15:15.686
Get a shave.

15:15.863 --> 15:19.798
Lana, please hold up.
I've got to talk to you.

15:19.966 --> 15:23.562
Dacron, lightweight, easy care,
good choice.

15:23.737 --> 15:25.261
Thanks.

15:26.607 --> 15:29.075
- Lana.
- I'll have to call you back.

15:29.243 --> 15:32.508
Lana, stop. Stop right there.
Now, listen to me. Listen.

15:32.679 --> 15:35.545
I know you don't understand this,
but you're sick.

15:35.715 --> 15:40.119
What happened back in the office
between you and me was an illusion.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.846
It was a drug-induced episode.

15:43.022 --> 15:45.685
Someday we're gonna look back on it
and we're gonna laugh.

15:53.934 --> 15:55.924
Oh, look, it's Lana.

15:56.202 --> 15:57.533
Lana.

15:58.271 --> 16:00.501
Don't worry. Harry's here.

16:02.109 --> 16:05.544
Lana, please, talk to me!

16:05.745 --> 16:07.872
Here. I'll give you a sandwich.

16:08.047 --> 16:10.413
See, I told you it'd be fine.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.780
You hurt me, and you try and bribe me
with a sandwich?

16:16.222 --> 16:18.213
Hey, it could have worked.

16:18.758 --> 16:19.850
Lana...

16:43.583 --> 16:46.813
Did a really bad singer come by here?

16:55.927 --> 16:57.225
Bull, Lana!

16:58.197 --> 16:59.789
You're right.

17:01.233 --> 17:02.928
Good work.

17:05.371 --> 17:09.670
- Life is a cruel joke!
- Tell me about it.

17:14.347 --> 17:15.336
Thanks.

17:15.512 --> 17:19.313
I was on the dean's list in college, and,
of course, I edited the poetry magazine.

17:19.483 --> 17:21.112
- Lana.
- And...

17:21.287 --> 17:24.016
- Yes?
- Are you all right?

17:24.189 --> 17:28.250
Well, yes, considering
my emotional state, I'm...

17:28.492 --> 17:30.188
I'm...

17:30.428 --> 17:31.656
...very...

17:32.631 --> 17:34.326
Very...

17:35.400 --> 17:38.699
Harry, how could you?

17:41.573 --> 17:42.870
Wonderful.

17:43.041 --> 17:47.205
- I'm very sorry, Mr. Bostwick.
- That's okay. I understand.

17:47.379 --> 17:49.904
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

17:52.216 --> 17:55.118
Lana, darling, I know this is tough
for you to understand...

17:55.287 --> 17:57.551
...but you have got to try.

17:57.722 --> 18:03.627
You have had a very powerful reaction
to a medication...

18:03.795 --> 18:07.787
...and everything just isn't what
it seems to be right now.

18:07.965 --> 18:13.165
Your emotions are heightened,
and your sensitivities are heightened...

18:13.338 --> 18:14.998
...and your...

18:18.076 --> 18:20.839
You're out like a light, aren't you?

18:28.552 --> 18:31.783
Have you ever seen anyone
sleep like that?

18:31.956 --> 18:35.687
Not without candles at both ends.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.698
I was just resting my eyes.

18:44.868 --> 18:47.359
For five hours?

18:48.439 --> 18:50.737
- Oh, my God.
- She sounds better.

18:50.908 --> 18:54.935
The guilt is coming back into her cheeks.

18:55.679 --> 18:58.614
- Court?
- Oh, it was over long ago, honey.

18:58.782 --> 19:02.775
- Can we get you anything?
- Over the counter.

19:03.153 --> 19:05.781
No. No, thank you.

19:05.956 --> 19:09.187
You're all so nice to be concerned after...

19:09.360 --> 19:12.021
...what I must have done.

19:12.195 --> 19:15.029
Don't worry about it, kid.
You're still young.

19:15.199 --> 19:18.895
Big embarrassments are still ahead.

19:19.068 --> 19:21.629
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night, Selma.

19:21.805 --> 19:25.172
- I'm going too. Take care, Lana.
- Bye, Bull.

19:25.342 --> 19:30.541
- Well, if my services aren't needed...
- Yeah, I guess I'll be running along too.

19:30.814 --> 19:33.907
- Take care, honey.
- Thank you. Thanks for everything.

19:34.083 --> 19:37.451
Let's go ask Bull if he'll walk us down
to the garage.

19:43.826 --> 19:45.761
You must be...

19:45.929 --> 19:49.193
...furious.
- Forget it. I'm just glad you're okay.

19:50.867 --> 19:54.201
Seems like the cure was worse
than the disease in this case, huh.

19:55.872 --> 19:57.499
I...

19:57.673 --> 20:02.906
- I meant how I embarrassed you before.
- No. Bostwick understood all that.

20:03.079 --> 20:06.480
- No, I meant before that.
- What you did in the court? No.

20:06.649 --> 20:08.514
I meant after that.

20:10.753 --> 20:12.550
The lip lock.

20:14.757 --> 20:16.554
Was it that ridiculous?

20:17.192 --> 20:20.685
- No.
- Of course you know it was just the drugs.

20:20.863 --> 20:22.490
Well, of course.

20:22.665 --> 20:27.602
But there are those who say that drugs
simply do away with one's inhibitions.

20:29.405 --> 20:30.394
Meaning?

20:31.140 --> 20:34.405
Meaning that sometimes we act crazy
and we do impulsive things...

20:34.577 --> 20:37.375
...because somewhere underneath...

20:37.547 --> 20:40.606
...we want to act crazy
and do impulsive things.

20:41.584 --> 20:46.111
- Are you implying I wanted to kiss you?
- Oh, no, no. Course not.

20:46.288 --> 20:49.747
Well, good, because I would never imply
that you enjoyed being kissed.

20:49.926 --> 20:54.419
No matter what I'm pretty sure I felt coming
back from you when it was happening.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.899
Then we're even.

20:58.601 --> 20:59.829
Right.

21:05.207 --> 21:09.200
It's sort of funny thinking about
you and me.

21:09.377 --> 21:10.708
Yeah.

21:10.912 --> 21:13.814
- That's funny.
- What's so funny about it?

21:16.151 --> 21:19.382
Well, Lana, if you weren't
engaged, maybe...

21:22.290 --> 21:23.848
Maybe...

21:25.594 --> 21:27.494
Gil Hodges.

21:28.230 --> 21:30.630
- What?
- I was trying all day to think of the name...

21:30.799 --> 21:34.667
...of the guy who played first base
for the Dodgers in '52.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.530
Gil Hodges.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.873
Well, you're busy,
so I guess I better be going.

21:41.042 --> 21:42.771
Lana, are you okay?

21:43.145 --> 21:45.169
Perfectly fine, thank you.

21:47.282 --> 21:48.806
See you tomorrow?

21:49.718 --> 21:53.278
- I got nothing better to do.
- Great.

21:54.456 --> 21:56.083
Well...

21:56.791 --> 21:59.350
...good night.
- Good night.

22:01.295 --> 22:02.854
Lana?

22:04.900 --> 22:06.389
Yes?

22:09.703 --> 22:11.194
Good night.

22:12.973 --> 22:14.531
Good night.

22:36.430 --> 22:38.091
Harry?

22:41.402 --> 22:43.393
Are you all right?

22:45.539 --> 22:49.804
Well, I just wanted to say that...

22:50.010 --> 22:53.707
Oh, well, never mind.
It's not important.

22:56.050 --> 22:58.314
Well, see you tomorrow.

23:00.688 --> 23:03.248
Are you sure you're all right?

23:03.690 --> 23:05.521
Good night.
