Don't.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.035
Come on, honey, we need to see it.

38:47.119 --> 38:48.245
No, you don't.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.371
Let us see it.

38:49.830 --> 38:50.998
Now.

38:56.170 --> 38:58.005
(PANTING)

38:59.590 --> 39:00.632
(WHISPERS) Ivy.

39:03.969 --> 39:06.096
Ivy, Ivy… Ivy, wait.

39:06.597 --> 39:07.764
(GASPS)

39:09.933 --> 39:10.934
Jesus Christ!

39:11.018 --> 39:13.020
You're having an affair
with the babysitter?

39:13.103 --> 39:14.646
No. No, I am not.

39:14.730 --> 39:16.190
(TREMBLING) It's on video!

39:17.399 --> 39:20.986
-She's fingering you in the tub.
-Ivy, I would never do that to you.

39:21.069 --> 39:24.406
Okay? Don't you see that
someone was in our house?

39:24.489 --> 39:26.658
Someone put a camera
in our bathroom.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.619
I told you it is all connected.

39:28.702 --> 39:30.662
What if Winter is working
with the neighbors?

39:30.746 --> 39:32.497
What if it's a setup? I am telling you,

39:32.581 --> 39:34.416
they are trying to tear us apart.
It is them!

39:34.499 --> 39:35.626
No, it's you!

39:37.628 --> 39:39.004
You cheated!

39:39.296 --> 39:41.423
-You betrayed our family.
-No, no.

39:41.507 --> 39:43.342
-Listen to me!
-Is there a problem here?

39:44.176 --> 39:45.260
ALLY: Uh…

39:46.094 --> 39:47.846
It's… It's really none of your business.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.264
Ma'am?

39:49.890 --> 39:51.099
I'm fine.

39:54.770 --> 39:56.104
I'm leaving, too. With Oz.

39:56.188 --> 39:57.648
I'm not spending another night
here with you.

39:57.731 --> 40:00.067
-I'm not… I'm not…
-Ivy, Ivy, I'm… Please!

40:00.150 --> 40:01.276
(WHISPERS) Listen to me.

40:02.027 --> 40:04.988
Please don't go.
Please don't leave me here alone.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.115
You should call Winter.

40:09.076 --> 40:12.538
And if that smiley face on
the door is what the cop said,

40:13.121 --> 40:14.498
you'll have plenty of company.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.209
(DOOR SLAMS)

40:17.835 --> 40:19.628
-Let's go, Oz!
-Ivy, please…

40:19.711 --> 40:20.963
(WHISPERS) Please, don't do this.

40:21.129 --> 40:23.340
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
-(MOUTHING)

40:27.427 --> 40:29.054
Why isn't Mama coming with us?

40:29.388 --> 40:32.391
Uh, she needs to stay home
and do some thinking.

40:33.642 --> 40:35.519
-It's my fault, isn't it?
-No.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.480
No, it is not your fault.

40:38.564 --> 40:40.315
And I will see you really soon.

40:40.983 --> 40:42.401
Okay? So don't worry.

40:43.110 --> 40:44.486

40:44.570 --> 40:46.405

HARRISON: No!

40:54.621 --> 40:56.498
I told you, I don't know what happened!

40:56.582 --> 40:58.917
I didn't do anything! I was asleep!

40:59.001 --> 41:01.545
Ozzie, we need you to stay here, okay?

41:01.628 --> 41:04.047
Just stay right here.
I will be right back.

41:04.131 --> 41:05.257
HARRISON: No!

41:05.340 --> 41:06.633
That's bullshit!

41:06.717 --> 41:09.678
I told you, I don't know what happened!
I was asleep!

41:10.137 --> 41:13.223
And I roll over,
and then I'm wet and sticky, and then I…

41:13.307 --> 41:15.100
I get up, and then I'm covered

41:15.184 --> 41:16.852
-in blood!
-Sir, try to calm down.

41:16.935 --> 41:18.270
No, I can't calm down!

41:18.645 --> 41:20.063
You need to calm up!

41:20.147 --> 41:23.108
You need to get to my level!
You need to get agitated!

41:26.153 --> 41:27.279
She's the one.

41:28.363 --> 41:29.489
She's the killer.

41:30.574 --> 41:32.409
What did you do, you crazy bitch?

41:32.492 --> 41:34.620
What kind of <i>Gone Girl</i> shit are you up to?

41:34.703 --> 41:36.622
Why don't you stay away from me,
you maniac!

41:36.705 --> 41:38.457
Oh, yeah? Where's Meadow?

41:39.166 --> 41:40.792
-What did you do to my Meadow?
-Hey, hey!

41:42.044 --> 41:45.631
No! No! Let me go! Let me go! It's her!

41:45.714 --> 41:48.258
-It's her!
-We should… We should go back inside.

41:50.469 --> 41:51.720
Where's Ozzie?

41:53.931 --> 41:55.182
Ivy, where's Ozzie?

41:55.265 --> 41:56.725
HARRISON: (GRUNTS) No!
