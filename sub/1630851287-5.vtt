She's like Christmas
for your eyes, ain't she?

00:37.054 --> 00:39.446
I wouldn't kick that kayak
out of bed for eating crackers.

00:39.598 --> 00:43.042
Me, neither. So what's
the BoatFax on this bad boy?

00:43.269 --> 00:45.085
Owned for 50 years
by a doctor and her husband

00:45.195 --> 00:47.695
in Kachemak before he passed,
mid-kayak.

00:47.790 --> 00:51.032
Gosh, I'm torn. This kayak
has such romantic history.

00:51.126 --> 00:52.700
It could also be
super haunted.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.628
I need a second opinion.
Dad? Dad?

00:54.722 --> 00:57.890
Come check out this kayak.
I need to know if it's haunted.

00:58.117 --> 00:59.874
Not sure why
he's looking in rec vehicles.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.301
He's strictly a workboat guy.

01:01.453 --> 01:05.380
Calls pleasure craft
"water trash." Hey, Dad? Dad?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.274
♪<i> Vroom</i> ♪

01:09.128 --> 01:10.627
♪<i> Whoosh</i> ♪

01:10.646 --> 01:12.196
Whee!

01:13.132 --> 01:16.075
(giggles)
Vroom. Whoosh.

01:16.302 --> 01:19.078
He's been coming by a couple
times a week for the past month.

01:19.229 --> 01:20.913
It's very common
for people his age

01:21.140 --> 01:22.915
to suddenly get interested
in a craft like that.

01:23.142 --> 01:24.991
It's what I call
"a midlife crisis vessel."

01:25.086 --> 01:27.311
But Dad's not having
a midlife crisis.

01:27.404 --> 01:31.164
He just turned 40 exactly
a month ago... Oh, my God.

01:31.317 --> 01:34.668
Uh, hey, uh, Dad, uh, uh,
What are you looking at?

01:34.820 --> 01:37.838
Oh, just looking
at this gaudy contraption. Yuck.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.673
$900 for a Sea-Doo?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.266
More like Sea-Don't.
(chuckles)

01:41.493 --> 01:43.102
Am I right?

01:43.996 --> 01:45.420
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Guys, this lunch-slash-meeting</i>

01:45.514 --> 01:47.606
is about Dad. I don't know
if you watch him like a hawk,

01:47.757 --> 01:49.274
with awe and admiration,
like I do, but if so,

01:49.426 --> 01:51.017
you may have noticed
that he's been acting

01:51.170 --> 01:53.028
a little different lately.

01:54.598 --> 01:56.323
Cologne?

01:57.025 --> 01:58.700
(whispers):
Sugar.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.679
Reversible.
Can't be.

02:02.698 --> 02:04.105
Papa.
Papa, no.

02:04.199 --> 02:05.866
What's the big deal
with Beef using a little bit

02:05.960 --> 02:07.851
of sugar
or getting a reversible belt?

02:07.870 --> 02:10.704
Because Dad says
coffee is a tool, not a drink.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.297
You use it,
you don't enjoy it.

02:12.449 --> 02:14.782
And he thinks reversible
belts fall apart much faster

02:14.802 --> 02:17.136
than regular belts
because of all of the reversing.

02:17.287 --> 02:19.120
(imitates Beef):
"It's half the belt
for twice the price."

02:19.214 --> 02:21.956
That means he bought it
purely for fashion.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.367
And I didn't know
what it all added up to

02:23.427 --> 02:25.310
until what happened this morning
at the boat yard.

02:25.462 --> 02:27.871
I discovered that Dad's
been going there every week

02:27.964 --> 02:30.632
-to stare at a Jet Ski.
-(gasps)

02:30.651 --> 02:32.559
Yeah. And then he just
drifts off into space

02:32.711 --> 02:35.136
and giggles while saying "vroom"
and "whoosh."

02:35.230 --> 02:38.824
So after going on W-Eb-MD
and eliminating illness, drugs

02:38.975 --> 02:41.234
or Dad having Joker syndrome,
I was able to figure it out

02:41.387 --> 02:44.145
with no help whatsoever
from Edna at the boat yard.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.481
Guys, Dad's going through
a midlife crisis.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.001
It was his 40th birthday
last month, and traditionally,

02:49.152 --> 02:50.818
Tobins who survive
past childhood

02:50.838 --> 02:52.337
die at exactly 80.

02:52.489 --> 02:54.414
I mean, except for Tobias Tobin,
who died at 54

02:54.566 --> 02:57.325
during the first-ever Lone Moose
hot dog eating contest.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.677
Yep, the runner-up shot him.

02:58.828 --> 03:01.405
Anyway, Dad's clearly
feeling the pressure of 40.

03:01.423 --> 03:03.348
There's only one way
to keep him from falling

03:03.575 --> 03:06.185
through the thin emotional ice
he's currently dancing all over.

03:06.336 --> 03:09.354
We help him get that Sea-Doo
jet ski.

03:09.506 --> 03:10.672
We just need $900.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.691
How are we supposed
to get that kind of cash?

03:12.842 --> 03:15.101
Uh, yeah, I make associ-ette
photograph-ette money.

03:15.254 --> 03:17.254
I've still got some of
my bar mitzvah money left.

03:17.272 --> 03:19.681
What bar mitzvah money, Ham?
We're not Jewish.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.866
Do you want to get Dad's Sea-Doo

03:21.093 --> 03:22.092
or do you want to interrogate me

03:22.110 --> 03:23.427
about my bar mitzvah money
all day?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.612
Well, now I will dramatically
reveal the reason

03:25.764 --> 03:28.040
I asked you guys to meet me here
instead of the house.

03:28.267 --> 03:31.043
-Ta-da!
-Yeah, we've all seen
that typo before.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.712
-We know it says "warffles,"
and we love it.
-No, look.

03:33.863 --> 03:34.880
I wanted to show you
this ad.

03:35.031 --> 03:36.215
Oh, we can do the Herring Run.

03:36.366 --> 03:37.883
Herring Run?
What are they running from?

03:38.034 --> 03:39.218
They look so happy.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.461
But I guess you can never really
know a fish's secrets.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.538
Every year, the department
of fish and wildlife

03:43.632 --> 03:45.540
lets people catch herring
for 15 minutes,

03:45.559 --> 03:48.118
and then that's it for the rest
of the year-- that's all.

03:48.136 --> 03:49.652
It's like playing the lottery.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.897
Some get an entire year's salary
in 15 minutes,

03:52.048 --> 03:53.790
others get no herring at all.

03:53.883 --> 03:55.292
It's pretty ding-dang exciting.

03:55.310 --> 03:58.403
I don't know. Dad always says
it's too flashy.

03:58.555 --> 03:59.571
But I guess we could try.

03:59.723 --> 04:01.573
We'll just have to be
very, very subtle.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.057
-ALL: Surprise!
-Aah!

04:03.077 --> 04:05.485
A surprise party.
Wow, great surprise.

04:05.637 --> 04:08.972
Now I'll go to my room while
you complete the party part.

04:08.991 --> 04:10.916
It's not a party, Dad.
It's an intervention.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.493
We had an off-site family
meeting at Maude's because

04:13.587 --> 04:15.921
we know about the belt
and the sugar

04:16.148 --> 04:18.482
and the Scent Sail, a cologne
for adventurous men.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.985
You're going through a midlife
crisis, and that's okay.

04:22.004 --> 04:23.745
Midlife crisis?
No, that's not me.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.840
That's for people in Ketchikan.
Or those fellas from<i> Wild Hogs.</i>

04:26.992 --> 04:30.251
I can smell your cologne
from here. It's wonderful.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.345
Fine, I bought cologne
and a reversible belt.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.940
It made me feel like a<i> Mad Men.</i>
Don't judge me.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.608
We're not judging, Dad.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.093
But you're not going to fill the
Sea-Doo size hole in your heart

04:39.113 --> 04:41.187
with reversible belts
and bottles of cologne.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.782
Only a Sea-Doo
can fill your Doo hole.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.784
I think Wolf's right, Dad.
All you do is fish,

04:45.935 --> 04:47.268
sleep an adequate
four and a half hours

04:47.362 --> 04:49.346
and eat food for energy
and not pleasure.

04:49.364 --> 04:50.847
You should treat yourself.

04:50.866 --> 04:52.849
(groans)
Okay, fine.

04:52.868 --> 04:54.701
Honestly, I would
love a Sea-Doo.

04:54.853 --> 04:56.962
But it's so impractical.
Yet cool,

04:57.189 --> 04:59.280
In a<i> Miami Vice</i> Don Johnson
kind of way.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.207
-Love me some Don John.
-I'm more of a Tubbs girl.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.951
And this one has four seats,
so we could all enjoy,

05:03.971 --> 05:05.862
in sensible shifts
of four at a time.

05:05.881 --> 05:08.048
But where am I gonna
get an extra $900?

05:08.142 --> 05:09.533
I carefully plan
every penny we spend,

05:09.551 --> 05:11.310
down to the lightbulb
we'll have to buy next week

05:11.419 --> 05:13.961
when the one in the living room
is scheduled to burn out.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.221
-Voilà!
-The Herring Run?

05:15.316 --> 05:17.149
I don't want to mess
with the Herring run.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.893
I hate it. All those boats
and planes-- it's a circus.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.228
How am I supposed to fish
if I can't even hear the ocean?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.990
If I can't sense the puffins
diving for herring,

05:25.141 --> 05:27.159
the whispers of the whales
scooping them up?

05:27.310 --> 05:29.143
Dad, you won't need
your sixth sense for fish.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.312
I'll get my ex-girlfriend Lara
to go up in her plane

05:31.332 --> 05:32.572
and spot for us.

05:32.741 --> 05:35.575
Okay, but my ex-friend Craig
Ptarmigan will he there,

05:35.727 --> 05:37.836
and I steer clear of Craig
at all costs.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.079
Dad, you got to
give up this idea

05:39.231 --> 05:41.006
that Craig
is your secret nemesis.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.749
He-he is the sweetest
sweetheart in town.

05:42.901 --> 05:44.067
Not to me, he isn't.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.510
He's had a grudge
against me for years,

05:45.662 --> 05:47.904
and I don't know why.
The man's out to get me.

05:47.923 --> 05:49.163
Dad, just because
you and Craig grew apart

05:49.257 --> 05:50.849
doesn't mean
he's out to get you.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.411
This is just like when Stacey B
got popular and told me

05:54.429 --> 05:56.003
she was too cool to hang out
with me. (short chuckle)

05:56.098 --> 05:58.690
Just a painless,
mutual parting of ways.

05:58.842 --> 06:01.693
Craig's a good guy, Dad.
He gives so much to the town.

06:01.845 --> 06:04.679
As they say at the Ptarmigan
Geology Center: Craig rocks.

06:04.773 --> 06:07.014
And the slide he donated
to the town playground

06:07.034 --> 06:09.201
is one of the best
I've ever slid.

06:09.428 --> 06:11.928
Sometimes I close my eyes
and pretend I'm being swallowed

06:12.021 --> 06:14.114
by a giraffe.
Pure bliss.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.208
Dad, you shouldn't be thinking
about Craig Ptarmigan.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.268
You should be thinking
about getting

06:18.361 --> 06:21.362
that mother-scratchin'
Sea-Doo. Okay?

06:21.382 --> 06:23.882
Now, we'll all pitch in
and catch just enough fish

06:24.033 --> 06:25.942
to buy that Sea-Doo,
and no more.

06:25.961 --> 06:28.461
Well, it would just be
a day of fishing with you all,

06:28.614 --> 06:30.614
which is my favorite
kind of day.

06:30.632 --> 06:32.039
Let's do it.

06:32.134 --> 06:35.435
Frang dang! Get ready
to fill your Doo hole, Dad!

06:38.381 --> 06:40.565
Hmm.
Where are you, old binoculars?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.067
Dad needs you
for the Herring Run.

06:42.294 --> 06:44.903
He prefers your vintage lenses.

Dad, calm down.

on his feet like we are.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.868
Hey, Beef.
I saw that you signed up.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.203
Glad you could make it.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.963
I just stopped by your boat,
but you weren't there.

07:45.114 --> 07:46.539
I was gonna give you this.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.208
I've been collecting
four-leaf clovers all year

07:48.360 --> 07:49.375
to pass 'em out today.

07:49.528 --> 07:51.711
-Hope it brings you luck.
-Aw, Craig.

07:51.863 --> 07:54.030
(Irish accent):
Thank you kindly, Mr. Ptarmigan.

07:54.123 --> 07:55.623
May the road rise to meet you.

07:55.717 --> 07:57.717
(chuckles) And may the ocean
put many fish

07:57.869 --> 07:59.385
in your pockets today,
my friends.

07:59.538 --> 08:01.538
(quietly):
Good luck my butt.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.873
See? Craig Ptarmigan's
not out to get you.

08:03.892 --> 08:06.392
In fact, he got you
this lovely gift.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.894
Clovers should have
three leaves, Judy.

08:08.046 --> 08:10.304
I'm sure it's cursed.
He probably got it from Gerald,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.065
that male witch
who lives near the dump.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.733
It's all part of Craig's
twisted game.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.069
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> So, Beef, what's your beef</i>
<i> with Craig?</i>

08:16.163 --> 08:17.478
I followed him on Snaphole

08:17.498 --> 08:20.073
and he seems like a total
sweetie on social media.

08:20.225 --> 08:21.391
Last week he posted
a video of him

08:21.484 --> 08:23.059
bottle feeding a baby dolphin.

08:23.152 --> 08:25.411
Well, growing up, we always
sat next to each other in class

08:25.564 --> 08:27.822
because the teacher didn't know
Ptarmigan started with a P.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.916
So we became friends.
We both liked pie

08:30.010 --> 08:31.510
and cake equally.

08:31.737 --> 08:32.919
We always had the same
number of teeth.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.088
We even have the same birthday,
which was so fun.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.848
But after high school
we just stopped hanging out.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.165
And for the past 20 years,

08:38.185 --> 08:39.576
I feel like
he's been messing with me,

08:39.594 --> 08:40.685
and I have no idea why.

08:40.912 --> 08:42.670
-Messing with you how?
-Well, one day I found

08:42.764 --> 08:45.506
a bucket of rotting chum
on my boat and saw someone

08:45.600 --> 08:49.252
-who may or may not have been
Craig walking away.
-Mm-hmm.

08:49.345 --> 08:50.754
<i> And one time at Val-U-Buy,</i>
<i> his cart, quote,</i>

08:50.772 --> 08:53.273
<i> "got away from him"</i>
<i> and crashed into our van.</i>

08:53.425 --> 08:54.774
<i> I also have a suspicion</i>
<i> that for years</i>

08:54.926 --> 08:56.442
<i> He's been replacing</i>
<i> all my nets</i>

08:56.595 --> 08:58.686
<i> with nearly identical nets.</i>
<i> It's diabolical.</i>

08:58.705 --> 09:00.613
Who knows what he'll do
here at the Herring Run.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.615
Dad, you got to stop thinking
about Craig Ptarmigan

09:02.768 --> 09:05.192
and you got to start
thinking about herring.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.028
Are you<i> herring</i> that, Dad?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.046
(chuckles)
You get it?

09:08.273 --> 09:09.381
Yes, I<i> herr</i> you.

09:09.532 --> 09:11.274
All right, let's all
go in for our final

09:11.367 --> 09:12.884
herring run... through.

09:13.036 --> 09:15.202
Are you guys gonna be doing
herring puns all day?

09:15.297 --> 09:17.872
Yes. And that's my
<i> fin-al</i> answer.

09:17.966 --> 09:19.373
Oh, boy.

09:20.285 --> 09:22.952
Oh, thank you
for bringing me, Ham,

09:22.971 --> 09:24.378

And earlier, when I said there's
at least 1,000 fish in the sea?

09:44.643 --> 09:47.477
Also true. And soon,
1,000 of my herring brethren

09:47.495 --> 09:50.330
will be hauled into the air,
where they are doomed to die.

09:50.482 --> 09:53.574
Oh, no.
Are they as charismatic as you?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.077
Some even more so,
but mostly not.

09:56.096 --> 10:00.173
-Regardless, it is unto you
to save them.
-How?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.175
Just save the herring, Ham.
Save 'em.

10:02.327 --> 10:04.510
Can you, uh, get your hands
on any explosives?

10:04.663 --> 10:06.271
I don't think so.

10:06.422 --> 10:08.498
Well, the only other idea I have
is singing the same song

10:08.516 --> 10:10.667
over and over again,
so I think you're on your own.

10:10.685 --> 10:14.003

10:14.097 --> 10:15.672

And while I have you,

11:03.054 --> 11:05.813
thanks for donating the owl
exhibit to the Nature Center.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.409

11:11.171 --> 11:12.912
You're owl-come.
Craig out.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.321
(sighs)
What a delightful man.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.899
He's taunting me.
He did this.

11:15.992 --> 11:17.008
He messed with the boat.

11:17.235 --> 11:18.418
I wonder what else
is booby-trapped.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.585
Dad, you're being silly.

11:19.738 --> 11:21.070
Our boat breaks all the time

11:21.089 --> 11:22.255
because it's
a million years old.

11:22.407 --> 11:24.015
Incorrect.
It's 48 years old,

11:24.242 --> 11:26.000
and it only breaks
some of the time.

11:26.094 --> 11:27.168

11:29.523 --> 11:32.006

He's a good guy.
Works hard, loves his family.

11:49.768 --> 11:52.877

but does he deserve to die?

11:53.029 --> 11:54.954
Does Seth deserve to die?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.214
Oh, no, not Seth.

12:01.129 --> 12:02.612

Game Warden Burt,
what brings you here?

12:35.313 --> 12:37.330
You're forbidding us
from fishing?

12:37.482 --> 12:39.406
Is that what you're saying?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.741
Yes, actually.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.076
Tough but fair.
I respect it.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.410
Let's head home, guys.

12:43.538 --> 12:45.096
I don't understand.
What's the problem?

12:45.248 --> 12:46.931
Just doing my job, Beef.
Those nets are going

12:47.158 --> 12:48.582
over the legal fishing border.

12:48.676 --> 12:50.101
Uh, I know you're a newbie
to the Herring Run,

12:50.253 --> 12:51.436
but I'll have to
give you a ticket.

12:51.587 --> 12:54.180
A newbie?
Is that slang for "new baby"?

12:54.332 --> 12:56.274
Because I can assure you
I am an old baby

12:56.425 --> 12:58.001
who's been fishing here
for decades.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.110
I know where the border is.

12:59.262 --> 13:00.594
Sit tight.
Writing this ticket

13:00.614 --> 13:01.854
shouldn't take more
than Craig minutes.

13:02.007 --> 13:03.615
Did you just say
"Craig minutes"?

13:03.842 --> 13:05.283
No, I said "Ptarmigan minutes."

13:05.434 --> 13:07.677
No, I said "12 normal minutes,"
and you all heard it.

13:07.695 --> 13:09.362
So Craig put you up to this.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.438
Pfft. Craig who?
What's a Craig?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.850

13:13.943 --> 13:15.685
-Burt.
-Well, I mean...

13:15.703 --> 13:18.112
Okay, fine.
Yeah, he did.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.355

-No.
-Unbelievable.

13:19.448 --> 13:20.373

13:20.467 --> 13:22.859

Craig's a hater.

13:22.877 --> 13:24.636
Why are you helping him,

13:24.863 --> 13:27.697
Or maybe I should call you
For Shame Warden Burt.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.308

well, he gave me a mini fridge

13:30.535 --> 13:33.036
and a code to get
a free 23andMe kit.

13:33.054 --> 13:34.128

16:08.969 --> 16:11.094
I want Beef's fish!

16:11.954 --> 16:14.514
We got company.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.720
Ahoy, Tobins! We hope you're
having a rich and bountiful...

16:20.814 --> 16:22.397
Not now, Londra!

16:26.894 --> 16:29.378
Where the heck are we going?

16:29.397 --> 16:30.896
Where the heck
are you going?

16:30.991 --> 16:33.566
(laughs) Let's see you get into
this channel with your large,

16:33.718 --> 16:35.885
very impressive,
state-of-the-art boat, Craig.

16:35.903 --> 16:40.498
Sick burn, Dad, using his own
incredible boat against him.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.964
Ah, we can't fit.
I'm turning the boat.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.733
We did it!
We lost Craig!

16:50.752 --> 16:54.554
Oh, look at him back there,
sucking, like we said earlier.

17:00.503 --> 17:03.746
Look at all that fish!
This is a monster haul.

17:03.839 --> 17:05.839
<i> COLTON:</i>
<i> Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham,</i>

17:05.933 --> 17:09.585
<i> you could still save some</i>
<i> of my brothers and sisters.</i>

17:09.604 --> 17:12.772
Enjoy freedom, friend.

17:12.924 --> 17:15.033
Oh, come on, bird!

17:15.943 --> 17:17.035
(grunting)

17:17.262 --> 17:18.778
Okay, you guys
just chill in this bucket

17:18.930 --> 17:21.280
till we get back to shore,
where I will release you.

17:21.432 --> 17:23.282
Anything else? Snacks? No?
You're good.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.877
<i> LARA:</i>
<i> Heads up-- Craig</i>
<i> went around the long way,</i>

17:26.028 --> 17:28.362
<i> and he's closing in</i>
<i> on you guys fast.</i>

17:28.456 --> 17:30.531
-(horn droning)
-What should we do?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.699
I say we play chicken,
go straight at him.

17:32.794 --> 17:34.610
He'll flinch.
I can feel it.

17:34.629 --> 17:36.370
Beef, here I come.

17:36.464 --> 17:39.390
Are you going to ram
into my boat and drown my kids?

17:39.617 --> 17:40.725
What?
No.

17:40.968 --> 17:43.061
I'm just gonna nudge your boat
and knock your net loose

17:43.288 --> 17:44.804
so all your fish will get away.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.230
Craig, why are you doing this?

17:46.382 --> 17:48.232
Everyone, brace for nudging!

17:50.311 --> 17:53.629
(gasps) We hit something!
We're taking on water!

17:53.648 --> 17:57.075
You mess with the Beef,
you get the reef.

18:02.398 --> 18:04.140
-There they are!
-Toss a buoy!

18:04.233 --> 18:05.708
Buoy toss!
(grunts)

18:06.661 --> 18:08.402
Oh, no!
We can't reach them.

18:08.496 --> 18:10.404
Lower the net
so they can grab on.

18:10.498 --> 18:12.757
-Let the fish go.
-With pleasure.

18:12.984 --> 18:16.344
Dad, the Sea-Doo!
Your midlife crisis!

18:18.339 --> 18:20.914
Craig, grab the net.
Climb aboard!

18:20.934 --> 18:23.601
No way. I won't
let you rescue me, Tobin.

18:23.786 --> 18:26.178
Look, whatever it is you've had
against me all these years,

18:26.331 --> 18:28.272
you won, Craig-- you won life.

18:28.424 --> 18:29.607
You're a cool, rich, single guy

18:29.834 --> 18:32.001
with a really nice boat
until very, very recently.

18:32.094 --> 18:35.613
Everyone loves you, and you
probably already own a Sea-Doo.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.431
I have a Yamaha

18:37.450 --> 18:40.009
and one of those
water jet pack things,

18:40.102 --> 18:41.844
but I didn't win.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.195
You did, Beef.

18:43.348 --> 18:46.106
Because I don't have
Kuh... Kuh...

18:46.126 --> 18:47.458
-Corn!
-Candy?
-Candy corn!

18:47.685 --> 18:49.943
I have some left over
from Halloween, Craig.

18:50.037 --> 18:51.445
You can have all of it.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.540
All this over some candy corn.
Makes me sick.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.025
You don't have what, Craig?

18:56.118 --> 18:58.210
Kathleen.
And it's all your fault.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.303
What are you talking about?

18:59.530 --> 19:01.046
You and Kathleen
never even dated.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.623
But we should have.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.476
You ruined my chances with her
at my birthday party.

19:05.628 --> 19:06.960
Our birthday party.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.814
The joint one we had
when we both turned 18.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.132
<i> I came out of the bathroom,</i>

19:12.226 --> 19:15.211
<i> and you called me...</i>
<i> you called me...</i>

19:15.229 --> 19:16.896
(laughs)
Craig Turd-migan!

19:16.990 --> 19:20.641
<i> CRAIG:</i>
<i> After that, everyone started</i>
<i> calling me Turd-migan.</i>

19:20.735 --> 19:24.162
<i>And Kathleen went home with you</i>
<i> that night instead of me.</i>

19:24.313 --> 19:26.146
<i> I wasn't even taking a turd.</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:28.073
I was vomiting.

19:28.226 --> 19:30.501
You got Kathleen,
and every time I see you,

19:30.653 --> 19:33.337
I'm Craig Turd-migan
all over again.

19:33.489 --> 19:36.007
Sorry, Craig.
I was young and dumb.

19:36.234 --> 19:38.234
Hey, Dad, Craig passed out
from the cold.

19:38.252 --> 19:39.752
Whoops.
I'm on it.

19:39.904 --> 19:41.345
CRAIG:
Thanks for saving me, Beef.

19:41.497 --> 19:43.589
While I was in the water,
I got some clarity.

19:43.741 --> 19:46.517
Also hallucinations,
but mostly clarity.

19:46.744 --> 19:49.412
I've always had a little
Kathleen-shaped hole in my heart

19:49.430 --> 19:50.930
and turning 40
only made it worse.

19:51.082 --> 19:53.340
But I realized
I don't want your life, Beef.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.027
I hate kids. That's why
I donate playground equipment.

19:56.178 --> 19:58.921
I prefer they stay there
and away from me.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.256
I feel the same.

20:00.349 --> 20:02.107
About not wanting your life,
not about kids.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.275
I believe kids are funny,

20:03.428 --> 20:04.944
smaller versions
of regular people.

20:05.096 --> 20:06.370
Also, I love mine.

20:06.522 --> 20:08.355
And you know Kathleen
left me, right?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.600
Aw, man, I would love
to be left by Kathleen.

20:11.619 --> 20:12.785
There's still time.

20:12.937 --> 20:13.878
Thanks, man.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.028
I have a confession.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.288
I tried to save these herring,

20:16.441 --> 20:18.883
but instead,
I accidentally killed them.

20:19.034 --> 20:20.276
In the heat of the moment,

20:20.294 --> 20:22.202
I put them in fresh water
instead of salt water.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.037
<i> Molly of Denali,</i>
with that herring

20:24.057 --> 20:25.297
and your bar mitzvah money,

20:25.450 --> 20:27.283
we'd have enough
to rent a Sea-Doo.

20:27.376 --> 20:29.301
Eh. I realized something
out on the water, too.

20:29.454 --> 20:31.470
Growing old isn't about
grasping at youth

20:31.622 --> 20:32.788
by getting a Sea-Doo.

20:32.807 --> 20:34.473
It's about grace
and dignity and...

20:34.567 --> 20:36.459
Ah, screw it,
let's rent that Doo.

20:36.552 --> 20:37.902
Midlife crisis?

20:38.129 --> 20:40.796
More like
