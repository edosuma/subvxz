00:51.800 --> 00:53.040
<i>Hundreds of years ago,</i>

00:53.120 --> 00:55.327
<i>when the Romans
occupied Britannia,</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:58.809
<i>the clans of the north
were a people
impossible to tame,</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:02.089
<i>and so the emperor, Hadrian,</i>

01:02.160 --> 01:04.083
<i>erected a wall
across the isle</i>

01:04.160 --> 01:07.801
<i>to stop their deadly raids
and control the countryside.</i>

01:09.880 --> 01:12.087
<i>Though Rome eventually fell,</i>

01:12.160 --> 01:14.640
<i>the Wall still stands.</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:17.451
<i>Knights of the southern
kingdoms guard its ramparts,</i>

01:17.680 --> 01:19.444
<i>ever fearful
of the mysterious north,</i>

01:19.520 --> 01:23.605
<i>where some clans,
led by a wise
circle of druids,</i>

01:23.880 --> 01:26.008
<i>are content to work
their lands in peace,</i>

01:26.720 --> 01:28.848
<i>while others envision a day</i>

01:28.920 --> 01:31.446
<i>when the wall
comes tumbling down.</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:48.847
<i>May the fire carry our voices</i>

01:49.280 --> 01:51.647
to the stars
under which we sleep,

01:52.400 --> 01:55.051
let the spirits
bless our homelands

01:55.440 --> 01:58.489
as we honor
the old codes we keep.

02:08.639 --> 02:09.800
Oh, heavens,

02:09.880 --> 02:14.010
druids from every clan
gather here to understand
your mysteries

02:14.320 --> 02:16.084
and learn of the future.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.364
A falling star

02:39.960 --> 02:41.724
from the constellation Draco.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.286
This is a sign

02:44.360 --> 02:46.601
to gather swords,
go over the wall

02:46.680 --> 02:50.002
and claim the wealthy lands
that are rightfully ours.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.084
Put this in our trove
for safekeeping.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.365
Brother Brude,

02:59.120 --> 03:01.521
sometimes
you must leave

03:01.600 --> 03:03.329
well enough alone.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.207
Are we not guides to our
people of the north?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.968
Why learn the spells
of the ancients

03:11.040 --> 03:13.771
if not to use them
for a just cause?

03:14.880 --> 03:17.167
I'm beginning to doubt
this druid circle

03:17.240 --> 03:19.811
can effectively lead
the Celts any longer.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.965
This falling star
could mean

03:27.040 --> 03:29.042
a new era for the Celts.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.444
An era of peace.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.171
Our people
are tired of fighting.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.002
That is why I invited the
Painted Tribe to join us.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.171
The Picti.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.368
To spur the clans to war.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.128
They can be
quite motivational.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.321
I will take

04:12.760 --> 04:13.761
you!

04:15.320 --> 04:17.368
By sun and moon

04:18.440 --> 04:21.363
switching stance,
two as one,

04:21.600 --> 04:23.682
druids, dance!

04:38.320 --> 04:42.291
By the light of the moon,
by which all power flows,

04:43.920 --> 04:47.129
we will show our
people the way forward

04:48.120 --> 04:49.485
with blood

04:49.840 --> 04:51.205
and iron!

05:23.560 --> 05:25.164
All right,

05:25.240 --> 05:26.924
you puking foot-lickers!

05:34.840 --> 05:38.606
Tomorrow, the squires
who have pleased me

05:40.600 --> 05:41.806
will be knighted

05:43.320 --> 05:45.607
and earn a Silver Sword.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.323
This is your last test

05:50.440 --> 05:51.805
of combat.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.845
And the winner

05:57.280 --> 05:59.009
gets a cut

05:59.200 --> 06:00.611
of the collections.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.926
Begin.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.801
Don't take it too hard,
we can't all be knighted.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.560
I'm sure you'll make
a fine soldier.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.728
I'm not taking orders.
I'm giving them.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.320
Put some weight in it!

06:27.640 --> 06:28.721
Get a blade!

06:31.640 --> 06:33.529
Finally,
something interesting.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.730
I'm getting a seat
at the knight's table.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.882
Do you always need
two friends to get
your sword up?

06:40.320 --> 06:41.526
I've been waiting
a long time

06:41.600 --> 06:43.170
to give your tart
mouth a beating.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.688
It's obvious
you should quit, Gareth.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.681
I don't quit.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.761
You Will.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.246
I quit.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.606
Oh, now he'll see.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.681
I quit.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.884
Please, Gareth.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.609
Sir Gareth.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.404
First day
of the month! Pay up!

07:53.480 --> 07:54.811
Make your payments!

07:55.040 --> 07:56.166
Pay up!

07:56.320 --> 07:57.970
Pay your respects
to Sir Horsa.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.411
What? No.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.561
Please, sir.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.126
Here's your blood money.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.884
And much good
may it do you.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.770
- Watch your mouth!

08:08.080 --> 08:09.127
Pay up!

08:09.720 --> 08:10.767
Come on, pay up!

08:10.840 --> 08:11.887
Coins.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.561
What good will a few coins
from a poor man do you?

08:18.640 --> 08:21.211
You think that wall
is enough to protect you
from the savages?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.250
Show some respect.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.171
It's that time!
Everyone pays!

08:27.240 --> 08:30.130
These last few months,
they've been
preparing for war.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.679
How'd you like us to let
them meet your daughter?

08:40.440 --> 08:41.441
Get inside. Go.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.249
Who did you think
defends the garrison, eh?

08:43.320 --> 08:44.765
You there.
You're next.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.491
We're about to fetch you
some of those coins, squire.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.801
Old man!

09:00.280 --> 09:01.805
Got clay in those ears?

09:02.240 --> 09:03.765
It's time for your tribute.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.490
Trade's dried up.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.602
People are scared,
they've moved south.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.288
I haven't sold enough
to give you a cut.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.130
You know the routine.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.771
Need me to remind you?

09:20.720 --> 09:21.721
Oh.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.560
You've got
a good eye.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.244
Twelve days
of my life in that.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.801
How much of yourself
have you ever put
into one thing?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.162
Is he giving
you trouble in there?

09:49.680 --> 09:50.681
No!

09:52.960 --> 09:55.088
Just showing him
who's in charge.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.121
Feels light.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.086
Some of them
were short, master.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.568
But they won't
do it again.
Keep my share.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.049
A squire walking away
from his cut?

10:34.880 --> 10:35.920
I only meant to honor you.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.441
You honor me

10:38.880 --> 10:40.325
by obeying my command.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.366
Kneel.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.244
Lower.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.571
Lower.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.723
You remember that smell?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.930
It's the stench of the
poor and the common.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.163
Why do you want
to go back there, boy?

11:18.880 --> 11:21.326
I'm not a boy anymore, master.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.405
And I don't want to go back.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.285
I want to be a knight.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.522
This is what you've
worked so hard for,

11:32.680 --> 11:34.284
and you'd throw
all that away.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.521
For what?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.361
Mercy.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.280
You're good with a blade
but you've cost me money.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.680
Get your kit
and get out.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.491
You're not gonna be knighted.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.169
But I've done
all you've ever asked.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.127
I've oiled your armor,
tended your horses.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.529
I've got nothing else.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.080
By my count, you owe me
a hundred crowns.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.761
Bring it to me.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.640
Then you can have your sword.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.446
You can be one of us!

12:08.680 --> 12:09.681
You can be a knight.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.486
I'd have to steal
to earn that much.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.806
Better get started then.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.729
Swear by your life.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.649
I swear my affinity.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.646
Swear by your life.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.365
I swear my affinity.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.362
More knights, more war.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.569
All rotten to the core.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.530
Arise, knights of
Sir Horsa's Guard!

13:27.760 --> 13:29.250
My roof leaks,

13:30.400 --> 13:31.811
but not this much.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.771
Come on.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.731
More soup, Begilda.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.842
He's a grown man.

14:01.480 --> 14:05.769
The legends say that
when dragons were alive,
they served mankind.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.608
So I thought tableware
seemed appropriate.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.360
But no one buys it.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.200
Who wants to touch
a lizard every time
you need a drink?

14:13.600 --> 14:15.921
It'll be popular again,
you'll see.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.566
People need a sign
to believe in.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.441
Five years.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.680
You asked how long
I put myself
into something?

14:25.920 --> 14:27.922
Five years cleaning
my master's boots.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.121
And is that an order
you still want to belong to?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.051
Plague took my parents.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.320
Priests got rid of me
as soon as they could.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.250
Being a squire was hard,

14:40.840 --> 14:41.841
but I belonged.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.127
When you're a knight, you get respect.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.088
I'll find those hundred
crowns and my sword.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.921
I won't be poor anymore.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.489
Where I come from, we say,

14:53.600 --> 14:56.365
"The poor are first to suffer,
but also first to help."

14:57.480 --> 14:59.164
There's honor in that.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.445
The heavens weep!

15:40.440 --> 15:42.363
What sorcery is this?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.041
Oh, it's a sign.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.486
It's a sign! It's a sign!

15:47.560 --> 15:49.562
Of what?
Maybe an opportunity!

15:51.360 --> 15:52.964
Tell the gate
to double the watch.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.044
This could be
a Celt-skin trick.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.246
Yes, sir.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.481
My father used to
mine soil and rocks,
and sometimes, he said...

16:05.040 --> 16:06.724
Ah! His tools!

16:06.960 --> 16:08.450
He said sometimes,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.968
the heavens would drop
a rock to the Earth,

16:11.040 --> 16:12.565
a rock full of riches.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.324
It is north
of the wall.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.961
There are painted
flesh-eaters everywhere.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.601
You're right.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.721
But I bet
there's gold

16:29.840 --> 16:31.205
at the end
of that rainbow.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.361
I can do it.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.490
I wish you
good fortune.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.728
Watching you young boys
run around the village

16:52.920 --> 16:55.526
made me wonder
what a son of ours
would have become.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.242
I would have passed him
this necklace

17:02.280 --> 17:03.725
to give his true love.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.089
Maybe you can
use it one day.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.121
Shh!

17:31.760 --> 17:33.205
Saltpeter.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.045
Did those
supplies come in yet?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.167
They have, sir.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.241
I've got
a knight's salary

17:39.320 --> 17:40.810
to spend on you now,
my lovely.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.011
Cuthbert.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.204
Is that a knight I see?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.843
No, my mistake.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.685
Just a beggar.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.364
With no coins
to my name.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.001
Yet.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.806
He's heading south,

18:24.640 --> 18:26.642
looking for a warm
street to die on.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.484
As usual
you're mistaken.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.046
I'm heading north.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.531
Over the wall.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.282
- Oh, I can't see!
- Arrest him!

18:37.360 --> 18:38.725
He's got my sword!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.127
Come on!

18:40.200 --> 18:41.201
He's getting away!

18:41.720 --> 18:42.721
Help! Thief!

18:43.000 --> 18:44.126
He's on the wall!

18:45.240 --> 18:46.651
To your posts!

19:04.360 --> 19:05.850
You're fen-sucked now.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.329
Good luck
among the savages!

19:14.280 --> 19:17.250
You'll eat your words
when I'm back
with a full purse

19:17.320 --> 19:19.243
and a knighthood to claim!

19:19.600 --> 19:20.681
I can still get him!

19:22.080 --> 19:24.003
Save your arrows.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.889
They're gonna have
his liver for lunch.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.771
No one will ever
remember you, Gareth!

21:21.160 --> 21:22.161
Show yourself.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.001
Ahhh!

22:22.120 --> 22:24.088
A thousand crowns
if there are a hundred.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.489
Pox me. A dragon.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.721
Gold.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.446
Fetch the sorcerer!

24:53.160 --> 24:54.764
No, you don't.
That's mine!

25:04.960 --> 25:05.961
No!

26:40.720 --> 26:43.644
Shade by day,
bright by night,

26:44.280 --> 26:47.170
to do my will
in full moon's light!

27:19.640 --> 27:23.440
Brothers.
Our greatest weapon
is now at hand.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.251
It's a sign!
It's a sign!

27:47.120 --> 27:48.610
It took me an hour
to brew that!

27:49.080 --> 27:51.651
I'm sure making poison
takes great patience.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.721
Poison?

27:54.160 --> 27:55.650
This is to keep you
from getting sick.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.001
What is this place?

28:11.720 --> 28:13.960
All that remains
of the collected
knowledge of the druids.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.601
They're our prophets

28:16.480 --> 28:17.481
and our oracles.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.764
I was an apprentice
with the White Circle,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.286
preparing to take
the Great Trial

28:24.160 --> 28:25.161
and earn this robe.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.769
That's when Brude
began his reign of terror,

28:30.720 --> 28:31.800
and the druids were killed.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.241
Brude.

28:33.640 --> 28:34.641
That sorcerer?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.121
I need to find him.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.641
He has the dragon's eggs.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.166
Yes.
And they're very valuable.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.040
There's no telling
what he might do with them.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.321
But save your strength.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.400
The time to face Brude
will come soon enough,

28:47.120 --> 28:48.326
now that you're on our side.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.204
I'm on no one's side
but my own.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.561
Are you sure?

28:53.440 --> 28:54.441
Look.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.921
The druids prophesized
that a favorable omen
would show in the sky.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.041
And it has.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.402
A dragon has returned
to our lands,

29:03.560 --> 29:05.562
and I believe it
brought you to us.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.331
It saved your life.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.281
You've been chosen.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.801
A sign.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.044
A dragon was
sometimes known to

29:17.320 --> 29:20.688
share its heart
with an ailing human
who'd earned its respect.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.168
You selflessly
protected its eggs.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.681
Could this be dangerous?

29:25.760 --> 29:27.922
I don't know.
I'm just an apprentice.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.480
Right now I'm learning
the unknotting spell.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.807
The knots
are supposed to disappear.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.200
I was once an apprentice.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.161
A squire.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.321
Before you became a knight.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.447
Yes.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.521
Oh, I knew it!

29:51.200 --> 29:52.725
The way you handled
this blade.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.723
And how you stood up
to those savages.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.440
You're a knight
of the Old Code.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.561
Old Code?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.049
Uh, Merlin,
the first druid,

30:02.360 --> 30:04.442
kept company with dragons
over 400 years ago.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.084
They helped the king
named Arthur bring peace
to the whole isle.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.604
The first dragons taught the
knights a code of honor.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.728
"A knight is sworn to valor.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.924
"His heart knows only virtue.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.244
"His blade..."

30:24.440 --> 30:26.488
Well, the rest is illegible,
it just says, "his blade."

30:26.560 --> 30:27.925
Defends the helpless.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.486
So you do know it.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.761
Yes.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.649
We recite it every day.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.930
Lorne. Is that
wall-crawler awake?

30:37.120 --> 30:38.121
Wall-crawler?

30:38.480 --> 30:39.481
That's Rhonu.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.040
You want my advice?

30:41.080 --> 30:42.411
Just nod
and say, yes.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.120
I told you to keep
the southerner bound.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.845
Stay back!

30:47.920 --> 30:49.843
Rhonu,
he can help us.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.400
He's a knight,
and the dragon saved him...
He's no knight.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.809
I am, and have
no quarrel with you.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.609
Now let me pass
and I'll be on my way.

31:00.840 --> 31:01.887
Kill the boy

31:02.480 --> 31:03.520
if you think it will help.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.561
Wait!

31:05.680 --> 31:07.011
You need our help
to find Brude.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.401
What if he could help us?

31:14.880 --> 31:16.564
What if he could
get the dragon

31:16.640 --> 31:18.005
to fight on our side?

31:31.400 --> 31:32.401
Not poison.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.441
Ah.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.081
My uncle and I cut down
five more bodies.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.970
Brude has driven every
village into hiding

31:57.040 --> 31:58.326
and hanged
the able-bodied men

31:58.400 --> 31:59.925
who won't
join his army.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.524
We only want
to live in peace.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.889
But between him
and your accursed wall...

32:16.200 --> 32:18.089
Lorne says this creature
saved your life.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.366
Is it true?

32:20.840 --> 32:22.683
Has a dragon
come from the stars?

32:23.920 --> 32:24.921
And with nine eggs.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.202
How will you convince it
to take up our cause?

32:36.760 --> 32:38.046
When dragons were alive,

32:39.080 --> 32:40.366
they served mankind.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.882
Knights had a special
bond with them.
We're chosen.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.282
It's southern hogwash.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.645
It was fate that
brought me to the dragon.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.483
Perhaps it's fate
that our causes unite.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.161
Each noose

33:00.960 --> 33:02.803
yields a string
that I will shoot back

33:02.880 --> 33:04.291
at Brude
in the name of the dead.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.245
This one is for my mother.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.364
Show us this dragon.

33:48.640 --> 33:49.721
This way.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.521
I can feel him!

34:05.040 --> 34:06.041
It's moving.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.199
Whoa!

34:55.679 --> 34:57.921
My heart.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.168
And your heart.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.204
Is one heart, yes?

35:12.160 --> 35:13.525
Me, Gareth.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.451
Me, strong.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.645
Good. Good human.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.881
Uh...

35:20.000 --> 35:23.129
The others, savages. Bad.

35:23.280 --> 35:26.045
Really awful,
evil, smelly...

35:26.120 --> 35:29.363
I shared my heart
with the village idiot.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.201
You talk?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.451
And you're a male dragon.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.321
<i>But you lay eggs.</i>

35:39.120 --> 35:41.327
Don't make assumptions.
The eggs are not mine.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.930
I'm their guardian.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.561
No offense meant.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.450
And I didn't know
dragons could talk.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.081
We can't.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.845
At least not like this.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.730
You did this to me.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.280
When our hearts
were shared,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.089
I suddenly found
words in my mouth.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.161
Do you have a name?

36:00.240 --> 36:04.325
Back home I am called,
Hissyoxyillammochogannatoss.

36:04.880 --> 36:05.881
So...

36:07.000 --> 36:08.411
How about something simpler?

36:08.560 --> 36:10.403
Uh, I know.
You're a dragon.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.770
<i>How about Drago?</i>

36:14.040 --> 36:15.804
<i>Drago.</i>

36:17.360 --> 36:18.361
<i>Drago.</i>

36:19.920 --> 36:20.921
It'll do.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.566
Why did you save me?

36:24.760 --> 36:26.489
For your mercy.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.203
The young dragons,
sit in their shells.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.408
Without thinking
of yourself,

36:32.840 --> 36:33.841
you saved them.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.002
Gareth. Great!

36:37.200 --> 36:38.201
No, no, no.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.567
It's all right.
They're friends.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.001
They're friends.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.848
Me, human.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.009
You, dragon.

36:55.120 --> 36:57.043
Been through that,
thank you.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.889
It speaks!

37:00.640 --> 37:01.641
A witness

37:02.640 --> 37:05.246
to a dragon and knight

37:06.520 --> 37:07.806
sharing a heart.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.481
A knight?

37:10.360 --> 37:11.361
<i>You?</i>

37:12.240 --> 37:13.241
Yes.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.561
Sir Gareth.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.327
Very well.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.846
I can use a knight
to help me rescue the eggs.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.167
In the wrong hands,
a great harm
can be done with them.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.321
Follow me.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.086
Why don't you fly down

37:51.160 --> 37:52.446
and burn them
all to a cinder?

37:53.240 --> 37:54.241
Watch.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.531
Hurry! It's coming!

38:10.880 --> 38:12.723
Keep the fires stoked.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.529
You heard that!
Downwind!

38:14.600 --> 38:16.887
I'll take a tongue for
every one that goes out!

38:22.720 --> 38:24.643
The sorcerer
has cursed me.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.885
By day or by the light
of a torch,

38:27.960 --> 38:29.485
I become ghostly.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.242
If you can darken
some torches,

38:33.440 --> 38:37.206
I can get the eggs back
and fulfill my duty
to raise the dragons

38:37.320 --> 38:39.084
as friends to mankind.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.527
And if we return
the eggs to you,

38:42.560 --> 38:44.562
will you help us
defeat these savages?

38:45.800 --> 38:46.801
Gladly.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.921
Intruder!

39:25.400 --> 39:26.606
Intruder!

39:36.040 --> 39:37.121
Prepare!

39:37.360 --> 39:38.486
Prepare!

39:38.560 --> 39:39.607
Oil!
Fire!

39:52.480 --> 39:54.130
Soon, my child.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.450
You will understand

39:57.520 --> 39:59.841
what I have
in store for you.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.961
Hmm.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.208
Paint can't hide
your true skin.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.441
A southerner?

40:13.040 --> 40:14.644
So far from home.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.844
What brings you
over the wall?

40:21.840 --> 40:22.841
Are you a spy?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.127
Ah.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.400
You like my treasures?

40:40.880 --> 40:42.530
I prayed

40:43.360 --> 40:46.443
that the prophecy
would bring me one dragon

40:46.520 --> 40:47.646
that I could make my own.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.681
Stay down.

40:51.960 --> 40:52.961
But nine?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.290
They will grow up
knowing me

40:58.360 --> 40:59.725
as their only master,

41:02.080 --> 41:03.605
and when their
wings are strong,

41:06.480 --> 41:08.209
they will fly
over your wall

41:09.440 --> 41:10.965
and show your people

41:11.040 --> 41:13.611
the horror
they've shown mine.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.445
Tie him to the tree.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.250
This is what
happens to those

41:39.320 --> 41:41.641
who stand against
the tide of the moon!

42:10.000 --> 42:11.764
They share
each other's pain.

42:16.960 --> 42:17.961
Water!

42:30.520 --> 42:31.521
Bonded,

42:32.560 --> 42:34.324
just like Merlin said.

42:37.800 --> 42:38.801
If you die,

42:41.000 --> 42:42.001
so does the dragon.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.849
So valuable.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.687
Brude chose the moon
to be his spirit guide.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.209
When it ebbs, at dawn,

42:57.920 --> 42:59.365
his powers will be
at his weakest.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.603
Sleep now,
Mother Moon.

43:04.160 --> 43:08.484
Swell thy belly to
bring upon a blacker night.

43:36.480 --> 43:37.561
Come.
We're going hunting.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.165
I can bring forth a fog

43:50.040 --> 43:51.883
so thick it will
hide your movements,

43:53.720 --> 43:54.721
yet so natural

43:55.960 --> 43:57.405
they'll never
suspect it's me.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.160
You better be worth
a hundred crowns,

44:21.240 --> 44:22.446
or I'm frying
the lot of you.

44:22.520 --> 44:23.567
Lorne.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.681
Here.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.601
I can do this.

44:44.280 --> 44:45.520
Earth and water,

44:46.160 --> 44:47.491
blackest bog,

44:48.800 --> 44:50.290
water and air,

44:50.640 --> 44:51.687
white as fog.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.090
White as fog!

44:58.880 --> 45:00.166
White as fog!

45:07.720 --> 45:08.767
What's this?

45:23.960 --> 45:25.200
Sorcery!

45:26.800 --> 45:28.643
Horses from the trees!

45:37.640 --> 45:39.324
Brace yourselves, men!

45:49.600 --> 45:51.170
Get out of the way!

45:59.560 --> 46:00.721
I'll take that.

46:05.480 --> 46:06.641
Catch!

46:10.240 --> 46:11.685
Ha! Ha!

46:25.040 --> 46:28.203
You'll need more
than smoke tricks, runt.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.121
Ha!

46:32.080 --> 46:33.081
Ha!

46:35.600 --> 46:36.761
Stop.

46:36.840 --> 46:38.126
We'll wait
for my uncle here.

46:38.200 --> 46:39.929
We should keep
moving while we can.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.968
Where I come from,
when you have
the advantage,

46:42.040 --> 46:44.361
you use it.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.249
Wait!

46:56.800 --> 46:58.290
Lorne! Lorne!

47:01.720 --> 47:03.609
Are you hurt?

47:04.800 --> 47:06.165
Sorcery has a cost.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.485
Even when
you get it right.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.085
Here, get up.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.923
The younger you are,

47:15.240 --> 47:17.561
the more it drains
your energy.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.126
<i>Drago.</i>

47:22.000 --> 47:24.048
Thank you
for saving them.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.090
Daylight burns.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.322
I must stay
in the shadows.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.484
Did you see that?

47:37.920 --> 47:39.365
He jumped.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.410
And what good is a dragon
powerless beneath the sun?

47:42.480 --> 47:44.960
We've staked
everything on him.

47:45.040 --> 47:46.080
Can't you break the curse?

47:46.120 --> 47:47.929
I was never ordained.

47:48.560 --> 47:52.042
But perhaps with time
I could study my scrolls.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.210
Find your remedy?

47:55.640 --> 47:58.166
We've some time until
they catch their horses,

47:58.240 --> 48:00.720
but they'll hunt down
every last family
in the vale to find you.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.404
No, Brude will
follow the eggs.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.767
I'll take them
south in the wagon,
drawing his forces away.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.444
That will give you time
to gather those in hiding,

48:06.520 --> 48:07.885
and a chance
to make a stand.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.042
Head south and you hit
the Wall in three days.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.963
There's more road
to the north.

48:12.040 --> 48:14.646
Unless you're planning
on taking those eggs
back over for yourself.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.242
No. I can travel
faster over ground
I've already covered.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.049
Besides, I'm a knight.

48:20.600 --> 48:23.001
I'm chosen.
The dragon trusts me.

48:23.640 --> 48:25.005
All right.

48:25.680 --> 48:27.125
South it is.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.769
But Brude has men taking
slaves in the hills.

48:31.160 --> 48:32.161
We'll have
to be careful.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.129
We?
Well, I'm coming
with you.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.680
And Lorne can study
his scrolls along the way.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.808
Arm every man
who can fight,

48:41.520 --> 48:43.648
then come south and we'll
trap Brude against the Wall.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.366
Rhonu, the journey
will be difficult,
with little sleep.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.329
Do I look like
I've lived a life
of comfort?

48:48.400 --> 48:50.164
I forbid it.
Forbid?

49:02.640 --> 49:05.166
I'm only concerned
for your safety.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.489
And can you blame me?

49:08.560 --> 49:12.042
You must have felt something
when you touched my heart?

49:15.640 --> 49:17.290
Let's get started.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.960
She grows on you,
does she not?

49:22.040 --> 49:23.804
Like a thorny vine.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.927
The answer is no,
by the way.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.244
I can't blame you
for feeling protective.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.241
Well, laugh, if you will.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.280
Come now,

49:45.360 --> 49:47.727
you really think a Celt
could like a southerner?

49:48.880 --> 49:50.564
Well, a man is a man,
is he not?

49:50.640 --> 49:52.404
Aye, a man be a man,

49:53.240 --> 49:55.402
but his homeland
gives him his nature.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.485
At least that's
what we believe.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.130
Inside the Wall.

50:00.840 --> 50:02.842
Inside? You mean outside.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.688
No, this side is inside.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.888
The other side is inside.
This is outside.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.566
You built the Wall
to keep us in.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.251
Like animals in a cage.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.646
It was built
to keep you out,

50:13.720 --> 50:15.051
like monsters at your door.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.964
And I didn't build it.
And I am not

50:19.200 --> 50:20.531
a monster.

50:20.840 --> 50:23.207
I could have chosen
wiser words.

50:38.600 --> 50:39.647
Whoa!

50:42.440 --> 50:44.727
What in hellfire
just happened?

50:44.800 --> 50:45.847
I was just holding it.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.367
I didn't mean to.

50:47.480 --> 50:48.561
Until the dragons hatch,

50:48.640 --> 50:51.291
they have no control
over their fire.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.766
I'm afraid
some of them

50:52.840 --> 50:54.365
might not survive
this journey.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.647
I need the southerner alive!

50:59.720 --> 51:01.927
They'll have
heard the sound.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.409
Then we get off
the road. Go on foot.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.164
Stick to broken ground.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.330
Hand me the eggs.

51:11.640 --> 51:12.880
Slowly.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.320
That's it.

51:15.480 --> 51:16.766
Careful.

51:20.480 --> 51:21.845
That's it.

53:01.880 --> 53:03.848
There's a cave
up ahead.

53:37.680 --> 53:38.761
Gareth.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.965
What do you see?

53:41.040 --> 53:42.326
A shadow.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.842
It has shape and feeling.

53:45.080 --> 53:46.570
Yes.
Brude's dark sorcery

53:46.640 --> 53:47.926
has opened the shadows to me

53:48.000 --> 53:50.890
and through our hearts,
to you as well.

53:51.320 --> 53:53.482
Come. I'll show you
how it works.

53:54.560 --> 53:57.291
Waiting for me to carry
you over the threshold?

53:59.640 --> 54:01.440
Master shadow jumping
and you'll travel

54:01.480 --> 54:03.244
with great speed.

54:06.600 --> 54:07.931
Like growing wings!

54:08.000 --> 54:09.525
Drago! Wait up!

54:11.040 --> 54:13.088
Step number one,

54:13.160 --> 54:15.128
think of the shadows
as doors.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.164
Use your imagination.

54:33.600 --> 54:36.046
See? Every shadow
is a passageway.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.766
Now give it a try.

54:39.080 --> 54:42.289
It's shadow jumping,
not shadow standing.

54:42.520 --> 54:43.885
Yeah, keep laughing,
lizard breath.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.241
Step number two,

54:45.320 --> 54:47.721
choose a shadow
to exit ahead of you.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.883
Step number three,
focus and take your
mind off distractions.

54:50.960 --> 54:52.450
Now follow me.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.165
Jump, jump, jump!

54:59.600 --> 55:00.840
Jump!

55:01.120 --> 55:02.121
Jump!

55:02.800 --> 55:04.211
Jump, jump, jump!

55:04.600 --> 55:05.726
Jump!

55:05.920 --> 55:07.445
You can do it!

55:08.240 --> 55:09.651
Concentrate!

55:10.080 --> 55:11.241
Jump!

55:18.200 --> 55:19.611
Ow.

55:20.280 --> 55:22.965
Maybe you haven't
inherited anything from me.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.964
Either that or Rhonu's
distracting you.

55:26.360 --> 55:28.601
I do think she likes you.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
You're mad.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.967
Notice how she
sneers at you.

55:32.520 --> 55:35.444
When a female dragon
finds a male worthy,

55:35.560 --> 55:36.846
she strikes him
with her tail.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.280
Let's hope that tradition

55:40.360 --> 55:42.681
doesn't catch on
amongst humans.

55:45.240 --> 55:46.730
You like her too.

55:46.800 --> 55:48.165
I do not.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.688
Each day, our bond
grows closer.

55:50.760 --> 55:53.491
First it was pain, sorrow.

55:54.440 --> 55:57.887
But now I can feel
how your heart races
when she's near you.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.684
We're being chased
by a murderous sorcerer.

55:59.760 --> 56:00.966
Of course
my heart's racing.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.322
A true knight would
be able to train hard

56:03.400 --> 56:05.050
and set aside
distractions.

56:05.120 --> 56:08.169
I trained for years,
you talking saddlebag.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.727
How dare you? Take that.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.649
Oh! Ow! Ow!

56:32.440 --> 56:34.807
You're making
assumptions again.

56:36.600 --> 56:37.806
Armored.

56:40.720 --> 56:42.165
You don't feel anything?

56:42.240 --> 56:43.924
Maybe a tickle.

56:49.880 --> 56:51.291
It's nice to see
you found the occasion

56:51.360 --> 56:52.850
to play the fool.

56:55.320 --> 56:56.401
Come.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.688
Lorne's found something.

57:01.160 --> 57:04.050
It is called, simply,
the Sorcerer's Curse,

57:04.760 --> 57:06.364
an incantation of enslavement.

57:08.080 --> 57:10.162
The victim will follow
the druid's command,

57:10.280 --> 57:12.521
but only from
dusk till dawn.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.729
In daylight

57:15.800 --> 57:17.609
they will be weak, useless.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.328
There is always a price,

57:22.120 --> 57:23.610
even to a sorcerer
such as Brude.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.280
See here?

57:27.320 --> 57:29.243
The curse takes
its hold slowly.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.489
But at the full moon,

57:33.120 --> 57:35.361
the victim loses
his own will.

57:40.640 --> 57:42.881
Drago will be
on Brude's side.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.120
Two days.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.126
Come to me.

58:09.960 --> 58:12.691
Come to me.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.041
Something wrong?

59:32.120 --> 59:33.770
I was dreaming
of the great things

59:33.880 --> 59:36.247
the dragons will do
for mankind.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.164
When I felt
the curse quicken.

59:38.560 --> 59:41.928
It seems evil desires
can spoil a dream

59:42.000 --> 59:44.606
just like they can a heart.

59:56.440 --> 59:58.488
Two more days
to the Wall.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.365
And for Drago.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.924
What was her name?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.560
Begilda.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.404
Is she beautiful?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.963
Has she borne children?

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.443
You'd have to
ask her husband.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.003
What wicked habits
do you keep
over that Wall?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.490
You misunderstand.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.166
She's an old woman
who showed me kindness.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.844
And as for beauty,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.571
I've seen more of it
on this side of the Wall,
truth be known.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.850
They were here.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.570
Signs of a fire.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.841
Fear.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.244
We're getting closer.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.447
Put your feet on!

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.046
Get down.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.809
Move yourself,
you dog!

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.850
I know that clan.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.805
Some are cousins from
homesteads to the east.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.725
Five guards.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.326
We could free them.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.926
Are you mad?
We have to keep moving.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.645
Once they pass,
we can carry on

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.131
over the ridge
and into the forest.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.920
The eggs are the only
thing that matter now.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.206
What matters
is my people's freedom.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.610
Here.
Careful.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.920
Do what you will.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.331
I'm helping them.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.640
Rhonu, wait.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.120
Listen.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.602
You could have tried to stop her.
Me?

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.968
You're supposed to be the
knight in shining armor.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.644
Oh, we're leaving?

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.801
She said to go on.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.040
It's a clear shot south once
we get through the forest.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.686
Sir Gareth.
I've seen you fight.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.401
You can take them.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.246
She's all alone.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.446
You've already
lost us one dragon,

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.760
do you intend
to kill the rest?

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.648
Keep going!
I said move!

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.767
The ties that bind,

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.730
hear my call,

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.651
un-entwine,

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.881
free from all!

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.000
We're free!

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.801
Lorne!

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.765
We're free!

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.206
Gareth.
Whoa!

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.122
A knight is sworn to valor.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.521
Look!

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.404
I'm back!

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.607
Shade by day,
bright by night,

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.365
to do my will
in full moon's light!

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.650
All cannot
survive this journey.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.841
<i>Sacrifice what you must.</i>

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.887
Shoot! Shoot!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.286
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.041
Oh!

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.088
Through your own shadow!
What valor!

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.722
Southern man!

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.687
I see you've gone
dizzy-eyed

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.445
for that yeasty scut!

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.205
Kiss her neck
while you can,

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.211
before I stretch it
like her mother's.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.449
Hey, hey. Wait.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.680
Let's go.
No!

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.807
No!
Let's go. Come on.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.645
There's still too
many of them. Come on.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.720
The code.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.928
When Drago
regained his form,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.365
could that have
been your doing?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.883
Me? How?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.684
Well, you upheld
the code.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.285
You came back.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.645
And to my recollection
that was the precise
moment Drago appeared.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.768
You share feelings, pain.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.930
Perhaps he can feel
the valor in you too.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.284
How does it feel?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.205
Seeing home?

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.128
Hard to see anything
but a wall.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.645
By end of day tomorrow

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.166
we'll be trapped
between it and Brude.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.006
Your uncle will
make it, I'm sure.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.162
He'll be riding
into certain death

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.890
if Drago has fallen
under Brude's control.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:29.365
The men of the Wall
will honor a knight's
request for protection,

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.801
won't they?

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.531
Yes, honor's
in their every word.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:42.051
Well, I know
a place we can shelter.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.328
The Druid's Circle,

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.008
where I was to get my robe.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.439
No more.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:18.404
The curse grows stronger.
I can't move.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.450
You have to fight it.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.968
Brude is a potent sorcerer,

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.609
which apparently
l'll never be.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.286
I can't find a way
to break the curse.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:35.965
I am now
a danger to you all.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.451
You must leave.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.291
We need you.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.810
I will not be enslaved.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.520
I will take
my own life first.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.290
And mine?

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.607
No!

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.040
There must be another way.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.050
Rhonu is right.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.489
I can't take your life.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.206
Choices must be one's own.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.682
I never thanked you
for sharing
your heart with me.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.362
And I never said
I was sorry

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.771
for doubting

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.127
that you're a true knight.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.045
It is time.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.201
Will I still
feel your heart?

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.601
What do I do?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.930
What happens now?

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.284
Follow the code,
like a knight always does.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.810
I'm not a knight.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.405
I never was.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.691
I don't even know
what one is anymore.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.927
On the other side
of the Wall,

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.370
there is no code.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.730
It's just cruelty.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.085
I'm sorry.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.206
Gareth,

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.724
if you would
truly be a knight,

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.887
your might will
uphold the weak,

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.921
your word will
speak only truth.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.924
And if this is to be
my last dawn of freedom,

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.441
I'm glad you were
here by my side,

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.931
my friend.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.010
Well, this is it.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.281
We can't run any further.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.491
Stay hidden.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.801
Oh! Oh!

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.848
Hey, wait! They'll shoot
one of us on sight.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.048
Hail! Hail!
Men of the Wall!

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.802
It's me! Gareth!
Don't shoot!

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.284
Hold your fire!
Don't shoot!

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.566
Man approaching!
Don't shoot!

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.165
On your post!
It's me!

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.846
Kalin, it's Gareth!

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.650
I returned from the north!

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.281
Kalin, open the gate.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.920
Any moment, a pack
of savages will come

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.365
through those trees,
hundreds of them...

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.680
Well, what have we here?

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.242
...led by a cruel
and powerful sorcerer
and a dragon.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.442
You won't be laughing
when you're under attack.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.845
So you've returned!

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.445
Not empty-handed, I hope.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.004
A dragon's egg,
made of gold.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.771
What's he doing?

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.766
Showing his true heart.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.565
Gareth! Wait!

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.681
Don't!

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.451
Archers ready!

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.965
No, wait.
They're with me.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.769
Fire on my command.
Look!

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.285
I see you've found
the fortune

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.203
you needed to buy
your knighthood.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.721
Chosen, was it?

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.406
I don't want it anymore.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.520
Open the gates.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.925
You have to believe me.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.730
I just want to help.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.245
Open the gate!

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.841
Your quest
hasn't improved

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.524
the company that you keep.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.880
But you've certainly
accomplished what
I asked of you.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.688
For this
marvelous creation,

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.120
I would knight you.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.923
But, seeing as
you've brought this,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.081
what is it,

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.727
a powerful sorcerer
to my wall?

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.284
I'd have you denied.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.166
Welcome,

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.961
my pet.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.202
Tonight, you will be
mine in body and mind.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.162
Was this part
of your plan?

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.324
He's led us to our deaths.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.367
And you, druid.
You said
he'd help free us.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.888
What are they
waiting for?

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.041
The fools have
forgotten their ladders.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.442
They can't
get over the Wall.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.044
They're waiting
for the moon!

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.090
Waiting for Drago.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.371
If we're up here
when he attacks,

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.010
we'll be burned to ash.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.724
I can free Gareth.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.731
But you can't do
the rope trick

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.444
because he's in chains.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.929
This is no rope trick.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.044
I hear your king has
feasted on every creature

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.044
that walks, flies
or swims.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.281
He will pay handsomely
to consume these rarities.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.884
Now, my child.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.288
- To arms!
- To arms!

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.962
Moon and sun,
two as one.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.288
Switching stance,
druids dance.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.364
Lorne? How did he...

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.210
Get up to the wall,
you cowards!

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.244
Feed!

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.403
- To battle!
- To battle!

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.730
We've lost him.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.560
Drago's gone.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.489
We've lost everything!

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.728
And the best thing
I could do is put an arrow

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.644
straight through
your heart and his!

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.480
Kill me if you want.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.689
But the only good part
of Drago left is in here!

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.526
He shared his heart with me
before he was cursed.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.331
But what are you gonna do?
Give it back to him?

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.131
I'm going to do
what the code requires.

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.646
Onward!

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.404
We've lost the dragon!

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.324
I've led you to a slaughter!

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.082
Come this far, my dillie.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.405
I'm seeing the other
side of that wall!

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.371
Charge!

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.446
Grab what you can.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.684
No need to count.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.849
Closed for business.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.281
You still trying to earn
a silver sword?

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.290
This one will do.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.606
Leave.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.530
You see what
caring about savages

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.568
unworthy of your
status brings?

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.924
You've doomed
this settlement.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.923
A knight
is sworn to valor.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.645
That old rhyme?

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.250
Just poetry, boy.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.521
It's more than
you ever taught me.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.204
And if it wasn't
for those words,

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.931
I'd still be
stealing from the poor.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.529
And you'd still have

01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.321
your head!

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.040
My blade shall
defend the helpless.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.325
See? I've taught
you something.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.241
And now for your
last lesson, squire.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.529
The old codes have
been bought and sold.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.125
A knight is only
worth his profit!

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.084
Aim for their front line.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.083
You, raise your elbow.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.401
Don't they teach you
anything here?

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.720
Better.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.360
Life takes some
damn strange turns.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.721
Ahhh!

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.362
I won't leave
their side.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.924
Our hearts know only virtue.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.491
Brave lass.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.122
Show me the dragon's eggs
and I'll spare you the noose.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.886
Rhonu!

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.685
For my mother!

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.963
Run! Run!

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.361
Gareth!

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:30.885
The curse is broken!

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.970
You saved me!

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.407
The village idiot
strikes again!

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.929
I only see a knight.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.891
Sir Gareth.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.728
Druid's alive!
Get him down!

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.126
Gareth?

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.964
I guess it worked.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.044
I'd say you've
earned that robe.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.601
Gareth!

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.126
Gareth!

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.930
Hold on, Rhonu.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.445
We did it.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.926
We won.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.326
Gareth.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.042
Now we really do have
something in common.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.364
<i>Let today mark
the beginning of a new age,</i>

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.843
<i>with the wisdom of the
dragons and the Old Code.</i>

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.522
<i>We can lay down our weapons
and unite together in peace.</i>

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.326
Sir Gareth!

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.243
This will now be called
the Dragon's Gate,

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.611
<i>and it will always
remain open</i>

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.882
<i>for people from both sides.</i>

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.408
Am I the chosen one now?

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.811
Choices must always
be one's own.

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.730
Ah! Welcome
from the north.
Hi, there.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.882
Would you like a gold
dragon mug, sir?

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.041
Uh, that one.
This one?

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.400
Yeah.
This is the best.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.204
One only. That one?

01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.601
Okay-

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.487
Welcome, Northerners.
Who would like
a dragon pot?

01:37:04.305 --> 01:37:10.329
