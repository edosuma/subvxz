00:55.838 --> 01:02.136
Is there anybody
Going to listen to my story.

01:02.678 --> 01:07.308
All about the girl who came to stay.

01:08.601 --> 01:12.688
She's the kind of girl, you want so much...

01:12.723 --> 01:15.734
It makes you sorry.

01:15.901 --> 01:21.323
Still you don't regret a single day.

01:21.406 --> 01:25.327
Oh girl...

01:29.289 --> 01:32.292
Girl...

01:43.762 --> 01:46.890
When I get to the bottom I go back
to the top of the slide

01:46.925 --> 01:50.035
Then I stop and I turn and I
go for a ride

01:50.070 --> 01:53.146
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

01:53.181 --> 01:56.276
yeah yeah yeah...

01:58.069 --> 02:00.029
Helter Skelter

02:01.281 --> 02:03.157
Helter Skelter

02:04.325 --> 02:06.202
Helter Skelter

02:39.361 --> 02:41.864
Hold me tight.

02:43.532 --> 02:46.035
Tell me I'm the only one.

02:46.660 --> 02:49.371
And then I might.

02:50.831 --> 02:53.334
Never be the lonely one.

02:53.375 --> 02:56.754
So hold me tight.

02:56.879 --> 03:00.215
Tonight. Tonight.

03:00.257 --> 03:02.718
It's you.

03:03.260 --> 03:07.514
You... you... you...

03:07.848 --> 03:10.352
Hold me tight.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.397
Let me go on loving you.

03:15.023 --> 03:17.525
Tonight. Tonight.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.488
Making love to only you.

03:21.613 --> 03:24.407
So hold me tight.

03:25.367 --> 03:28.286
Tonight. Tonight.

03:28.321 --> 03:30.956
It's you.

03:31.790 --> 03:35.126
You... you... you...

03:38.380 --> 03:41.508
What it means to hold you tight.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.804
Being here alone tonight with you.

03:46.513 --> 03:48.474
It feels so right now...

03:48.516 --> 03:51.102
Hold me tight.

03:52.478 --> 03:54.981
Let me go on loving you.

03:55.273 --> 03:56.524
Tonight.

03:57.358 --> 03:58.901
Tonight.

03:59.443 --> 04:02.154
Let me gone on loving you...

04:02.905 --> 04:04.448
Who will take me out next week?

04:05.491 --> 04:07.076
You'll be halfway around the world.

04:07.368 --> 04:09.996
Well, it better not be Phil Scully.

04:10.997 --> 04:12.164
Come here.

04:14.041 --> 04:15.293
I'll be back soon.

04:16.334 --> 04:18.337
They give you a furlough
after boot camp.

04:19.672 --> 04:20.714
And after that?

04:47.242 --> 04:51.038
- Yeah. All right.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.040
All right, then.

04:58.995 --> 05:02.707
Don't spend it all at once.
Last one for a while, eh, son?

05:02.916 --> 05:04.208
Last one ever, Cyril.

05:04.542 --> 05:06.461
I felt the same at your age.

05:06.669 --> 05:11.382
I told myself, "When I'm 64,
I'll be long gone from this place.

05:11.925 --> 05:14.594
- But I'm still here.
- Move it along.

05:13.269 --> 05:17.148
Some of us are thirsty and
the pubs have been open five minutes.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.611
Hi, Charlie.

05:24.113 --> 05:26.324
You're gonna miss this place.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.785
Don't count on it, Phil.

05:49.431 --> 05:51.767
I've ironed your best shirts.

05:52.476 --> 05:58.023
I'll be shoveling coal in a furnace,
Mum. I don't think I'll be wearing them.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.484
You'll be wearing them
when you go ashore in America.

06:00.519 --> 06:02.861
Yeah, well, that could be
months from now.

06:03.487 --> 06:05.913
If you wanted a seafaring life...

06:05.948 --> 06:07.783
...couldn't you have
signed up for the Mersey Ferry?

06:08.867 --> 06:10.703
At least you'd be home
for your supper every night.

07:06.719 --> 07:09.013
I sometimes feel
you're not telling me everything.

07:10.181 --> 07:12.350
I just need a break
from the yard, Molly.

07:14.352 --> 07:15.603
I'll be back before you know it.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.189
Or do you need a break from me?
Is that what this is about?

07:19.649 --> 07:20.691
Come here.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.613
Close your eyes and I'll kiss ya

07:26.739 --> 07:29.659
Tomorrow I'll miss ya

07:32.703 --> 07:36.207
And remember I'll always be true

07:36.332 --> 07:38.001
- Pull the other one.
- What?

07:39.253 --> 07:41.630
And then while I'm away

07:42.798 --> 07:46.343
- I'll write home every day
- You better.

07:47.594 --> 07:50.639
And I'll send all my loving to you

07:51.682 --> 07:53.725
You bastard.

07:54.393 --> 07:57.604
I'll pretend that I"m kissing...

07:58.146 --> 08:00.941
...your lips I am missing...

08:01.650 --> 08:06.571
...and hope that my dreams will
... come true

08:07.614 --> 08:10.742
...and then while I'm away...

08:11.076 --> 08:14.079
...I"ll write home every day...

08:14.579 --> 08:20.003
...and I'll send all my loving to you.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.137
All my loving...

08:23.172 --> 08:24.882
- Bye, sweetheart!
- Bye!

08:24.917 --> 08:26.593
...I will send to you...

08:28.052 --> 08:30.013
All my loving...

08:30.555 --> 08:33.683
...Darling I'll be true...

08:34.517 --> 08:36.602
All my loving...

08:38.062 --> 08:40.773
All my loving...

08:41.607 --> 08:43.775
All my loving...

08:44.444 --> 08:47.113
...I will send to you.

08:56.749 --> 08:58.125
Bye.

08:58.459 --> 09:00.628
- Go deep!
- Let's go...

09:00.878 --> 09:02.212
...Wildcats!

09:03.505 --> 09:06.467
All right, ladies, let's take a break.
Come on.

09:12.139 --> 09:17.853
Yeah... I'll tell you somethin'

09:17.895 --> 09:22.399
I think you'll understand

09:23.817 --> 09:28.238
When I say that somethin'

09:30.491 --> 09:34.371
I wanna hold your hand

09:43.004 --> 09:46.049
I wanna hold your hand.

09:47.175 --> 09:52.305
Oh, please say to me.

09:53.974 --> 09:58.353
You'll let me be your man

09:59.396 --> 10:04.109
And please say to me.

10:06.069 --> 10:11.367
You'll let me hold your hand.

10:12.201 --> 10:16.914
Now let me hold your hand.

10:18.582 --> 10:22.545
I wanna hold your hand.

10:24.714 --> 10:33.806
And when I touch you...
I feel happy inside.

10:36.642 --> 10:41.522
It's such a feeling that my love

10:43.316 --> 10:45.151
I can't hide...

10:46.110 --> 10:47.903
I can't hide...

10:48.696 --> 10:54.870
I can't hide!

10:55.579 --> 11:00.417
Yea, you... got that something.

11:02.502 --> 11:06.131
...I think you'll understand...

11:07.674 --> 11:12.679
and I... feel that something.

11:14.264 --> 11:19.895
I wanna hold your hand!

11:20.729 --> 11:25.025
I wanna hold your hand!

11:25.525 --> 11:31.032
I wanna hold your hand...

11:33.368 --> 11:37.956
I wanna hold your hand!

12:06.193 --> 12:07.569
Hop in.

12:08.779 --> 12:10.948
Thanks, mate. Appreciate it.

12:23.168 --> 12:24.545
Sorry. Excuse me.

12:32.595 --> 12:35.806
Shit! Goddamn it.

12:36.432 --> 12:38.851
Thanks, man.

12:40.185 --> 12:44.149
Excuse me, you don't where I
could find Professor Huber, do you?

12:44.691 --> 12:46.943
No such person.
Not that I'm aware of.

12:47.068 --> 12:49.571
Professor Wesley Huber?

12:50.614 --> 12:52.782
Listen, I've pissed off
every professor in Princeton...

12:52.824 --> 12:55.166
...and he's not one of them.

12:55.201 --> 12:56.953
Oh, wait a second,
there's a Wes Huber.

12:58.371 --> 12:59.831
That's him right over there.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.133
Can I have a word?

13:10.216 --> 13:13.178
If you're looking for work here,
check with administration.

13:13.219 --> 13:15.639
I got a job, thanks.

13:15.805 --> 13:17.474
You sound like a limey.

13:18.808 --> 13:20.226
I am, yeah.

13:21.561 --> 13:26.651
I was stationed there during the war.
I had some good times.

13:26.817 --> 13:28.819
Yeah, I know.

13:29.403 --> 13:32.114
At Burtonwood, right?

13:33.407 --> 13:35.242
How would you know that?

13:37.119 --> 13:39.538
I... I believe I'm your son.

13:42.249 --> 13:44.543
I don't think so.

13:45.086 --> 13:47.630
Me mother's Martha Feeny.

13:52.718 --> 13:55.304
How'd you track me down?

13:55.638 --> 13:58.182
Through Army records.

13:58.599 --> 14:00.601
If I would have known about you...

14:00.811 --> 14:03.313
What? You would've come back,
is that it?

14:03.772 --> 14:07.317
You know, she said that wouldn't
have proved that you loved her...

14:07.359 --> 14:08.986
...only that you felt obligated.

14:10.612 --> 14:14.116
Well, it would have been better
than raising a kid on her own.

14:14.199 --> 14:17.369
Yeah, well, she wasn't the only one
in those days.

14:17.411 --> 14:21.373
You could excuse a bastard by saying
his dad was killed in the war.

14:30.924 --> 14:32.884
Did she find someone else?

14:34.970 --> 14:38.390
There were a few hopefuls
over the years, yeah.

14:38.682 --> 14:40.560
I think I scared them off.

14:42.270 --> 14:44.439
- Listen, kid, I...
- It's Jude.

14:44.564 --> 14:46.357
Jude.

14:46.608 --> 14:49.485
I got a family.
I got a wife, I got two kids.

14:49.611 --> 14:54.657
Yeah, look. Mr. Huber,
I didn't come here to derail your life.

14:55.325 --> 14:58.036
You know? And I'm not here
for your love or your approval.

14:58.244 --> 15:01.713
I'm just here so that we both...

15:01.748 --> 15:05.752
Both know
that the other one exists.

15:10.423 --> 15:12.508
All right.

15:13.176 --> 15:17.138
- Fifteen bucks says you miss this shot.
- Fifty says your sister still marries me.

15:17.221 --> 15:19.475
Yeah, well, maybe.

15:19.683 --> 15:21.185
All right, window. Let's go.

15:21.393 --> 15:22.895
- All right, ladies.
- There you go.

15:23.103 --> 15:24.396
- Ready?
- Yep.

15:24.730 --> 15:26.231
Okay.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.566
Fore!

15:28.025 --> 15:29.777
Run!

15:30.152 --> 15:31.487
You missed!

15:31.695 --> 15:32.905
- Whatever.
- It was the wind.

15:33.113 --> 15:34.698
- Set me up.
- I believe in you.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.701
You couldn't hit the barn side
of a broad, man. Come on.

15:37.910 --> 15:39.286
There you go.

15:39.495 --> 15:40.996
Fore!

15:43.082 --> 15:46.335
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

15:46.543 --> 15:49.213
- How do you like me now?
- We're gonna get you, asshole!

15:49.421 --> 15:52.633
How do you like me? Go to bed.
Go to bed, you ain't got nothing.

15:52.841 --> 15:55.762
- Yeah, they're going back into...
- They're not going back to bed.

15:55.929 --> 15:57.639
- No, they're not.
- Go, go, go.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.358
Go, go, go.

16:09.859 --> 16:11.861
They went this way. Come on!

16:24.541 --> 16:26.626
Shit, I'm out of shape.

16:32.048 --> 16:34.677
You're the guy who was
asking for the janitor, right?

16:34.885 --> 16:35.886
Yeah.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.723
So, what are you,
like the assistant janitor?

16:40.266 --> 16:44.061
I'm just bunking down here,
you know, temporarily.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.230
- Why?
- Why do you need to know?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.443
You're wanted by the cops, huh?
FBI?

16:51.444 --> 16:55.364
You know, it looks to me as though
you're the one who's on the run.

16:55.573 --> 16:58.451
Yeah.
Thank you for that, by the way.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.661
What would they have done
if they caught you?

17:00.870 --> 17:05.833
I don't know. Something involving
genitalia and shoe polish.

17:06.584 --> 17:09.002
- Nasty.
- Yeah.

17:09.211 --> 17:12.758
- Where's that accent from?
- Same place as me. Liverpool.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.218
And do you have a name?

17:16.094 --> 17:17.429
Yeah.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.098
- It's Jude.
- Max.

17:21.767 --> 17:23.226
I'm pleased to meet you.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.313
Well, Jude,
as a stranger to our shores...

17:26.521 --> 17:31.485
...the least I can do is offer you
some Ivy League hospitality.

17:36.698 --> 17:38.033
Cheers.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.538
Welcome to the nursery.

17:44.581 --> 17:47.292
What would you do
If I sang out of tune

17:47.501 --> 17:48.961
- Thank you.
- Would you stand up

17:49.127 --> 17:51.255
And walk out on me?

17:52.298 --> 17:53.841
- Hey. I'm Chris.
- Lend me your ears

17:54.050 --> 17:55.969
- And I'll sing you a song
- Thanks.

17:56.177 --> 17:59.264
- And I'll try not to sing out of key
- There we go. All right.

18:00.139 --> 18:03.476
I get by
With a little help from my friends

18:04.310 --> 18:07.250
He gets high
With a little help from his friends

18:07.285 --> 18:10.191
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

18:11.651 --> 18:13.111
- Take it easy, man.
- Hold it in.

18:16.030 --> 18:18.449
What do I do when my love is away?

18:19.450 --> 18:22.335
Does it worry you to be alone?

18:22.370 --> 18:26.457
No, I
get by with a little help from my friends

18:27.709 --> 18:30.629
I get high with a
little help from my friends

18:31.755 --> 18:35.009
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

18:35.843 --> 18:38.762
Do you need anybody?

18:40.848 --> 18:42.933
I need somebody to love

18:43.976 --> 18:47.521
Could it be anybody?

18:49.064 --> 18:51.609
I want somebody to love

18:53.152 --> 18:56.614
Would you believe in a love at first sight?

18:56.697 --> 18:59.825
Yes I'm certain that
it happens all the time

19:00.993 --> 19:04.330
What do you see when you turn out the light?

19:04.830 --> 19:07.334
I can't tell you but I know
it's mine

19:07.667 --> 19:11.296
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends

19:12.964 --> 19:15.592
I get high with a little help from my friends

19:16.635 --> 19:19.846
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

19:23.725 --> 19:28.313
Do you need anybody?

19:30.398 --> 19:33.944
I need someone to love

19:35.403 --> 19:40.700
Could it be anybody?

Try with a little help from my friends

20:04.183 --> 20:09.063
Get by with a little help from my friends

20:14.819 --> 20:23.578
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends

20:41.305 --> 20:43.807
I can't believe her.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.520
I'm never having children.

20:48.729 --> 20:51.898
- Really?
- No.

20:52.107 --> 20:54.610
Think about it, it's pure narcissism.

20:54.818 --> 20:58.030
I mean, people putting out little
carbon copies of themselves, going:

20:58.238 --> 21:00.115
"Oh, doesn't he have
his father's eyes?

21:00.324 --> 21:02.243
Doesn't he have his mother's lips?"
It's...

21:02.452 --> 21:04.370
It's disgusting.

21:05.246 --> 21:08.124
Well, what about adoption?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.001
Luce!

21:10.376 --> 21:12.503
Lucy!

21:16.674 --> 21:22.895
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah

21:22.930 --> 21:29.395
It won't be long, yeah, 'till I belong to you

21:32.774 --> 21:37.153
Every night
When everybody has fun

21:38.154 --> 21:42.409
Here am I
Sitting all on my own

21:43.035 --> 21:51.001
It won't be long, yeah

21:52.586 --> 21:56.423
Till I belong to you

21:58.342 --> 22:01.720
Since you left me, I'm so alone

22:01.929 --> 22:05.557
Now you're coming
You're coming on home

22:05.975 --> 22:08.651
I'll be good like I know I should

22:08.686 --> 22:12.488
You're coming home, you're coming home

22:12.523 --> 22:18.279
Every night the tears come down from my eyes

22:18.314 --> 22:18.947
- Do you know when?
- Next weekend.

22:19.155 --> 22:20.448
He got a pass
before his outfit ships out.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.451
Every day I've done nothing but cry

22:25.662 --> 22:32.627
It won't be long yeah...

22:33.586 --> 22:38.049
It won't be long 'till I belong to you

22:40.135 --> 22:43.388
Since you left me I'm so alone

22:43.680 --> 22:47.642
Now you're coming, coming on home

22:47.851 --> 22:51.152
I'll be good like I know I should

22:51.187 --> 22:53.898
You're coming home, you're coming home

22:54.441 --> 22:59.447
Every day we'll be happy I know

23:00.281 --> 23:04.535
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

23:06.120 --> 23:12.460
It won't be long yeah...

23:22.678 --> 23:28.517
'Till I belong to you

23:34.732 --> 23:37.903
I tell you, man,
this is my favorite time of day.

23:38.111 --> 23:41.573
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

23:43.325 --> 23:45.118
- Hey.
- Max!

23:45.285 --> 23:46.870
Jailbait.

23:51.959 --> 23:53.418
- How are you? Good.
- I'm good.

23:53.627 --> 23:55.629
- Damn.
- Max, you're such a pervert.

23:55.796 --> 23:58.173
What? Some of them
are kind of cute.

23:58.590 --> 23:59.883
When did Emily get tits?

24:01.468 --> 24:03.053
Emily.

24:04.137 --> 24:07.599
This is Jude. I asked him over
for Thanksgiving.

24:13.523 --> 24:16.359
We don't have it in England.
Is it...? Is it a big deal?

24:16.567 --> 24:19.237
Well, it's a heartwarming
American tradition.

24:19.445 --> 24:21.447
Yeah. It celebrates the time...

24:21.656 --> 24:24.492
...when the Indians shared their food
with the early settlers.

24:24.659 --> 24:27.412
And how did we repay them?
We slaughter them in thousands...

24:27.620 --> 24:30.623
...and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.375
I'm Lucy.

24:35.295 --> 24:38.464
I went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs weren't there.

24:38.673 --> 24:40.508
- If you'd asked...
- You'd have said no.

24:40.717 --> 24:42.593
I never knew Princeton
had a golf program.

24:42.802 --> 24:43.761
They don't.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.556
It's just my way of unwinding,
you know?

24:46.764 --> 24:48.850
Whack a few balls around
at the end of the day.

24:49.058 --> 24:50.685
Those lectures can fry your brains.

24:50.893 --> 24:53.856
"Lectures. " What lectures?
He dropped two courses.

24:54.023 --> 24:55.274
Is that fashionable?

24:56.483 --> 24:57.610
Is what fashionable?

24:57.985 --> 25:01.655
- Your haircut, or lack of one.
- Androgyny suits you, Max.

25:02.114 --> 25:04.491
These kids are so spoiled.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.786
I washed dishes
to put myself through college.

25:07.995 --> 25:11.957
You've never washed one since.
More stuffing, Jude?

25:12.499 --> 25:13.834
I'm stuffed enough, thanks.

25:14.001 --> 25:16.962
You have any idea what your father
pays for those tuition fees?

25:17.171 --> 25:19.298
- Please.
- You know, Uncle Teddy...

25:19.506 --> 25:21.717
...he won't have to
pay them much longer.

25:21.925 --> 25:24.720
- I'm dropping out.
- The cranberry sauce isn't as tangy...

25:24.928 --> 25:26.930
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I am not cut out...

25:27.139 --> 25:28.641
...for this collegiate crap.

25:28.849 --> 25:30.894
No problem. What are you...?
What's your plans?

25:31.102 --> 25:33.647
You gonna buy a broken-down
station wagon...

25:33.855 --> 25:35.982
...and drive across America
like Jack...

25:36.191 --> 25:37.442
- What is it?
- Kerouac.

25:37.651 --> 25:39.152
- Mom.
- I read.

25:39.361 --> 25:43.698
Well, actually, I was hoping to borrow
your car, Dad. It's got AC and stereo.

25:43.990 --> 25:46.201
Goddamn it, Max!

25:46.409 --> 25:48.411
Be serious for once.

25:48.620 --> 25:51.122
What do you actually intend
to do with your life?

25:51.331 --> 25:53.833
Why is it always about,
"What will you do?"

25:54.042 --> 25:57.045
"What will you do? What will he do?
Oh, my God, what will he do?"

25:57.253 --> 25:58.713
Do, do, do, do, do.

25:58.922 --> 26:00.757
Why isn't the issue here who I am?

26:01.132 --> 26:04.177
Because, Maxwell,
what you do defines who you are.

26:04.386 --> 26:08.516
No, Uncle Teddy,
who you are defines what you do.

26:08.724 --> 26:09.809
Right, Jude?

26:14.188 --> 26:16.983
Surely it's not what you do...

26:17.191 --> 26:20.361
...but it's the way that you do it.

26:24.740 --> 26:27.493
Sorry you had to sit through that.

26:28.536 --> 26:30.788
Is it like that at your house?

26:30.997 --> 26:32.832
Not really, no.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.042
It's just me and me mum...

26:35.251 --> 26:38.713
...so me education
is rarely a topic of conversation.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.675
Max said you came here
to find your father.

26:43.301 --> 26:47.014
- You jumped ship.
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

26:47.222 --> 26:51.518
It was weird when I got
this Princeton address, you know.

26:51.727 --> 26:55.063
I had it in my head that he might be
some kind of Einstein or something.

26:55.272 --> 26:58.859
But it turns out he's just
a working stiff like meself.

26:59.234 --> 27:00.527
How'd it go?

27:01.695 --> 27:03.530
It was okay.

27:03.905 --> 27:06.700
I mean, he didn't invite me back
for Thanksgiving.

27:08.410 --> 27:12.372
Might've been a bit tricky anyway. I've
spent half me life trying to hate him.

27:14.374 --> 27:18.545
He walked out on me mum
when I was just a bun in the oven.

27:22.591 --> 27:25.178
I never realized I had it so easy.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.265
I mean, we're so... normal.

27:29.474 --> 27:30.933
Oh, yeah?

27:31.684 --> 27:33.603
I don't know, dinner was quite lively.

27:33.811 --> 27:37.440
You know, when do that lot start
chucking plates at each other?

27:37.732 --> 27:40.443
- Dessert. Yeah.
- Oh, dessert. All right, yeah.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.405
My God, you...
You have perfect teeth.

27:45.365 --> 27:47.533
No, you do, they're perfect.

27:47.742 --> 27:49.577
People in Liverpool,
they only seldom do.

27:49.786 --> 27:53.998
They stick out in all different
directions. It's horrible.

27:54.207 --> 27:55.375
You never heard of braces?

27:55.583 --> 27:59.045
Yes, I have, thank you very much.
We use them to keep our trousers up.

27:59.253 --> 28:01.839
Goddamn it! It's like this
every time I come home.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.718
I mean, what the hell do they
talk about when I'm not here?

28:04.927 --> 28:06.762
You, mainly.

28:06.971 --> 28:09.932
Jude, shit. I'm sorry, man.

28:10.140 --> 28:11.934
Come on, we gotta
do something with him.

28:12.142 --> 28:15.479
He's a sailor on leave. He needs
a bar, a brawl and a brothel.

28:21.485 --> 28:22.486
I've just seen a face

28:22.695 --> 28:25.114
I can't forget
The time or place where we just met

28:25.322 --> 28:26.490
She's just the girl for me

28:26.699 --> 28:29.535
And I want all the world to see
We've met

28:31.287 --> 28:34.748
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way

28:35.040 --> 28:38.711
And I'd have never been aware but as it is
I'll dream of her tonight

28:42.048 --> 28:44.426
Falling, yes I am falling

28:44.551 --> 28:48.596
And she keeps calling me back again

28:48.631 --> 28:50.814
I have never known alike her

28:50.849 --> 28:54.394
This I've been alone and I have
missed things and kept out of sight

28:54.429 --> 28:57.480
but other girls were never quite like this

28:59.566 --> 29:01.985
Falling, yes I am falling

29:02.485 --> 29:06.031
And she keeps calling me back again

29:06.615 --> 29:08.491
Oh, yes!

29:08.867 --> 29:11.077
What will you do
if you don't go back to college?

29:11.286 --> 29:14.289
What any irresponsible, unmotivated
dropout would do:

29:14.497 --> 29:16.374
Go to New York. Like, tonight.

29:16.958 --> 29:18.668
What's the rush?

29:19.461 --> 29:20.880
I mean, I like it here.

29:21.088 --> 29:23.758
Come on. The most exciting thing
that ever happened here...

29:23.966 --> 29:27.053
...was when they got automatic
pin setting. I'm talking the Village.

29:27.261 --> 29:29.722
Think about it.
Great music, great dope, orgies.

29:30.097 --> 29:32.350
It'll be a gas!

29:43.861 --> 29:45.529
Yeah!

29:51.786 --> 29:53.746
Falling, yes I am falling

29:54.789 --> 29:58.543
And she keeps calling me back again

29:58.585 --> 30:01.678
Falling, yes I am falling

30:01.713 --> 30:04.716
And she keeps calling me back again

30:06.426 --> 30:08.011
She's got a boyfriend.

30:08.220 --> 30:10.764
That's okay. I've got a girlfriend.

30:37.583 --> 30:39.419
Forget it, man.

30:39.836 --> 30:41.671
I'm not living here.

30:44.674 --> 30:46.301
You must be the two who called.

30:46.509 --> 30:49.637
Yeah. We saw your ad
in Rat Magazine.

30:50.513 --> 30:52.849
Right. Come on in.

30:55.018 --> 30:57.145
It's our kitchen through here.

30:58.479 --> 31:01.816
This would be our main room...

31:02.025 --> 31:05.278
...living room, whatever room.

31:06.362 --> 31:08.197
Real bummer losing my last tenant.

31:08.406 --> 31:12.952
He played sax at the Gaslight.
Out all night, slept all day.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.289
We could do that.

31:15.497 --> 31:17.875
You'd have to, man,
because I'm a singer.

31:18.083 --> 31:21.295
I can't have no one screwing up
my beauty sleep before 2:00.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.340
Someone can take this bedroom.

31:24.548 --> 31:27.509
I'm gonna need two weeks in advance,
guys. Is that a problem?

31:27.676 --> 31:31.472
- No, no, no, that's not a problem at all.
- You look kind of clean-cut.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.808
Then again, could've murdered
your granny with a hammer.

31:39.688 --> 31:43.150
Actually, we're students.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.069
I'm Jude and he's Max.

31:45.277 --> 31:46.528
I'm Sadie.

31:46.737 --> 31:49.031
That's me. Out of bounds.

31:49.990 --> 31:52.493
- Are you famous, Sadie?
- Man.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.287
Not yet.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.456
You guys have
a good memory for faces?

31:56.665 --> 31:58.708
Yeah, I think so. Why?

31:59.042 --> 32:00.919
There's no mirror in your bathroom.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.682
- Oh, man! What a fox!
- Yes!

32:13.890 --> 32:16.726
I mean, for an older woman, huh?

32:18.019 --> 32:22.148
Max, I will pay for my share of the rent
just as soon as I get a job, man.

32:23.108 --> 32:27.195
Jude, don't worry about it.
Look where we are, man.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.327
Move it, pal. Come on.

32:33.744 --> 32:35.830
Get out of here.

33:10.449 --> 33:16.163
When I find myself in times of trouble

33:16.198 --> 33:19.788
Mother Mary comes to me

33:19.823 --> 33:23.135
Speaking words of wisdom

33:23.170 --> 33:25.255
Get on the ground!
Get down!

33:25.380 --> 33:28.592
Let it be

33:29.426 --> 33:32.728
And in my hour of darkness

33:32.763 --> 33:37.976
She is standing right in front of me

33:38.810 --> 33:42.981
Speaking words of wisdom

33:43.016 --> 33:46.234
Let it be

33:46.360 --> 33:52.075
Let it be...

33:57.622 --> 34:01.584
Whisper words of wisdom

34:01.619 --> 34:05.129
Let it be

34:07.006 --> 34:10.969
And when the broken hearted people

34:12.219 --> 34:17.225
Living in this world agree

34:17.308 --> 34:20.770
There will be an answer

34:20.804 --> 34:24.940
Let it be

34:25.775 --> 34:29.495
For though they may be parted

34:29.530 --> 34:35.159
There is still a chance that they will see

34:35.195 --> 34:37.871
There will be an answer

34:38.080 --> 34:43.022
Let it be

34:43.056 --> 34:47.965
Let it be...

34:53.178 --> 34:57.349
There will be an answer

34:58.309 --> 35:03.153
Let it be

35:03.188 --> 35:07.569
And when the night is cloudy

35:07.986 --> 35:12.490
There is still a light that shines on me

35:12.525 --> 35:15.827
Shine until tomorrow

35:15.910 --> 35:19.039
Let it be

35:21.333 --> 35:25.629
I wake up to the sound of music

35:25.664 --> 35:29.507
Mother Mary comes to me

35:30.425 --> 35:34.095
Speaking words of wisdom

35:34.130 --> 35:37.307
Let it be

36:07.546 --> 36:12.760
Whisper words of wisdom

36:12.795 --> 36:16.639
Let it be

36:41.540 --> 36:42.666
Attention.

36:42.874 --> 36:46.378
The 7:05 Northeast Limited
leaving for New York City...

36:46.586 --> 36:49.881
...now ready for boarding
on Platform 20.

36:50.090 --> 36:55.262
Platform 20, Northeast Limited
now ready for boarding.

37:31.758 --> 37:34.886
Here come old flat top he come

37:34.921 --> 37:37.823
Grooving up slowly he got

37:40.891 --> 37:43.819
Holy roller he got

Hands down to his knees

37:49.068 --> 37:54.490

38:07.002 --> 38:10.130
He wear no shoeshine he got

Toe-jam football he's got

39:26.208 --> 39:28.419
Spinal cracker he got

39:28.669 --> 39:33.508
Feet down below his knees

39:34.968 --> 39:38.847
Hold you in his arms yes you can feel his disease

39:38.882 --> 39:38.889
What the hell are you doing, man?

39:39.389 --> 39:41.850
Come together

39:41.885 --> 39:44.311
Right now

39:45.145 --> 39:47.731
Over me

40:11.589 --> 40:13.549
Desmond, this boy
wants to talk to you.

40:13.758 --> 40:15.051
Hey.

40:19.597 --> 40:20.807
I love it.

40:29.148 --> 40:31.025
He roller coaster he got

40:31.060 --> 40:33.503
Early warning he got

40:33.538 --> 40:36.306

Mojo filter he say

40:39.932 --> 40:43.454

40:44.289 --> 40:49.795
Got to be good looking
'cos he's so hard to see

40:50.129 --> 40:51.463
Come together

40:52.923 --> 40:55.009
Right now

40:55.843 --> 40:58.554
Over me

40:58.721 --> 41:00.639
"Just stand on your head. "
She said, "Why?"

41:00.848 --> 41:03.267
"I wanna see what it'd look like
through a beer. "

41:03.434 --> 41:05.853
- Get off me.
- Oh, man.

41:09.148 --> 41:11.025
Hey, do you write your own songs,
Jo-Jo?

41:11.233 --> 41:12.443
Yeah.

41:12.776 --> 41:14.153
I got 20 in a notebook...

41:14.611 --> 41:16.238
...another 10 in my head.

41:16.447 --> 41:17.990
Leave room for anything else?

41:18.365 --> 41:21.577
Music's the only thing
that makes sense anymore, man.

41:22.244 --> 41:26.498
Play it loud enough,
it keeps the demons at bay.

41:34.257 --> 41:36.426
Hello, hello. Who are you?

41:37.969 --> 41:41.431
- Prudence.
- Where you from, Prudence?

41:42.098 --> 41:43.725
Nowhere.

41:44.309 --> 41:47.062
Oh, and before nowhere?

41:49.314 --> 41:50.982
Ohio.

41:51.191 --> 41:54.986
Then I was living
with this guy across the street.

41:57.822 --> 41:59.199
Did he do that to you?

41:59.699 --> 42:01.618
He was a mistake.

42:03.662 --> 42:05.206
Where'd she come from?

42:06.666 --> 42:08.960
She came in
through the bathroom window.

42:10.628 --> 42:12.296
Thanks.

42:13.381 --> 42:15.383
I understand you need to get away...

42:15.591 --> 42:18.052
...but why not come to Europe
with your father and me?

42:18.260 --> 42:20.262
I'd rather be with Max.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.139
In New York?

42:22.348 --> 42:25.142
Just for the summer,
till I go to college.

42:25.935 --> 42:29.689
I shudder to think how Max lives,
or what he's up to.

42:29.897 --> 42:32.358
He always attracts
the most dubious people.

42:32.566 --> 42:35.987
He's probably surrounded by
promiscuous dope fiends.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.822
Mom!

42:38.364 --> 42:41.242
You know me. I don't even smoke.

42:42.785 --> 42:45.247
The big, bad city's
not gonna get me.

43:15.527 --> 43:17.112
Isn't she fantastic?

43:20.574 --> 43:22.285
Amazing.

43:22.744 --> 43:24.704
She's our landlady.

43:24.996 --> 43:28.499
- You live with my brother too?
- Yeah, him and Jude took me in.

43:28.708 --> 43:31.002
I don't sleep with them anymore.

43:58.946 --> 44:00.491
Thank you.

44:00.908 --> 44:02.868
Hey, Lucy?

44:03.035 --> 44:05.412
How do you like New York so far?

44:05.621 --> 44:08.540
This is all I've seen. I only
got off the train three hours ago.

44:08.749 --> 44:11.126
- Oh, yeah?
- Let's hear it for the Po Boys, y'all.

44:11.335 --> 44:13.420
Do you wanna go out
and get some fresh air?

44:15.714 --> 44:18.008
- Yeah?
- How about another one?

44:18.217 --> 44:20.177
- All right, bring it home!
- All right!

44:21.053 --> 44:23.180
Man, it's packed in there.

44:23.847 --> 44:27.434
Your girlfriend didn't look too happy
about us leaving together.

44:28.143 --> 44:30.688
She... She's not my girlfriend.

44:30.896 --> 44:35.359
Well, you know, she's a friend
who's a girl.

44:38.321 --> 44:40.281
I thought you'd gone home.

44:40.490 --> 44:43.368
No, no. I like it here.

44:43.576 --> 44:44.953
Although I'm not really here.

44:45.161 --> 44:48.707
You know, without a visa
I don't officially exist.

44:48.915 --> 44:53.211
It's exhilarating in a way. It's like
a weird kind of freedom. You know?

44:56.798 --> 44:58.174
Hey.

44:59.217 --> 45:01.011
Are you okay?

45:02.387 --> 45:05.432
I mean, you know,
I heard what happened.

45:06.725 --> 45:08.059
Yeah.

45:11.688 --> 45:13.231
But...

45:14.774 --> 45:18.070
...a letter came for Max
before I left home...

45:19.572 --> 45:22.950
...and I haven't been able
to bring myself to give it to him yet.

45:26.203 --> 45:29.332
- Scrub the floor, right, Jo-Jo?
- That's disgusting.

45:30.041 --> 45:33.336
That was great, man.
You got a really good sound.

45:35.379 --> 45:37.465
You shouldn't have
dropped out of college, Max.

45:37.673 --> 45:41.052
Your sister's right. You had that
whole Ivy League thing going for you.

45:41.260 --> 45:44.513
- And your father's a lawyer and shit.
- Max, what exactly does it say?

45:45.931 --> 45:48.601
It says I have to report to
an induction center on the 7th.

45:48.809 --> 45:49.769
Bummer.

45:49.977 --> 45:52.063
You got a week to contract
some fatal disease.

45:52.271 --> 45:54.607
Guys tried all kinds of stuff
when I did my time.

45:54.815 --> 45:58.278
- You were in the military, Jo-Jo?
- No escaping it where I'm from.

45:58.487 --> 45:59.738
I went in when I was 17.

45:59.946 --> 46:01.907
Say you're a homo.
They don't take homos.

46:02.115 --> 46:05.160
Just say you're a pedophile.
Say you wanna go into the villages...

46:05.369 --> 46:09.247
...and you wanna rape and pillage
all the little girls that look like me.

46:09.456 --> 46:10.916
I remember this one cat.

46:11.124 --> 46:13.543
He ate a ton of beets
the night before the physical.

46:13.752 --> 46:16.254
- Looks like blood when you piss.
- Well, I hate beets.

46:16.463 --> 46:18.590
- Can we get the check, please?
- In a minute.

46:18.799 --> 46:20.550
- What is with these pricks?
- Calm down.

46:20.759 --> 46:23.971
My mate's brother swallowed
a ball of cotton to get out the army.

46:24.179 --> 46:25.389
What does that do?

46:25.597 --> 46:28.141
It shows up as, like,
a shadow on the x-ray.

46:28.350 --> 46:31.603
- Track marks. They won't take a junkie.
- You want him to shoot up?

46:31.812 --> 46:34.524
No. We could just jab his arm
with a needle a few times.

46:34.732 --> 46:36.901
Make it a rusty needle.
Then it'll get infected.

46:37.110 --> 46:39.153
- That could work.
- Yeah. Gets all nasty.

46:39.362 --> 46:42.156
- Max.
- Oh, man, Max, what are you doing?

46:43.825 --> 46:45.618
You can burn that paper, boy...

46:46.285 --> 46:48.287
...but you still gotta show.

46:52.291 --> 46:54.627
Daniel couldn't wait to go.

46:55.211 --> 46:58.798
He saw it as his patriotic duty.

46:59.048 --> 47:00.550
And I went along with it.

47:01.259 --> 47:02.719
I was proud of him, I guess.

47:05.722 --> 47:08.683
Apparently, he did
something brave...

47:08.891 --> 47:12.688
...so he wore a medal
when they buried him.

47:13.022 --> 47:15.274
You don't have to talk about this.

47:17.401 --> 47:18.569
I want to.

47:22.114 --> 47:23.991
I can't pretend like it didn't happen.

47:25.117 --> 47:27.745
He was my first boyfriend.

47:27.953 --> 47:30.914
He was the first person
I ever knew to die.

47:31.206 --> 47:34.460
I'd never even been
to a funeral before.

47:41.133 --> 47:42.801
I'm so scared for Max.

47:43.010 --> 47:46.096
Listen, no one and no gun
is gonna get Max.

47:47.598 --> 47:51.770
You know, he's so twisted,
he'll bend his way out of this fix.

47:53.146 --> 47:54.939
Hope you're right.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.067
I am right.

47:58.818 --> 48:00.195
I love the bugger.

48:19.965 --> 48:24.135
- Do you have the draft in England?
- Not anymore.

48:24.344 --> 48:26.638
Well, I'd have been exempt
as a shipyard worker.

48:28.933 --> 48:30.267
You should've studied art.

48:31.769 --> 48:33.104
Yeah.

48:33.437 --> 48:36.065
Well, I had to bring money
into the house.

48:36.273 --> 48:39.568
So I joined the ranks
of the great unwashed.

48:43.197 --> 48:44.657
Here. Come here.

48:44.991 --> 48:45.992
Come here.

48:49.745 --> 48:51.539
A little closer.

48:55.126 --> 48:57.169
I just wanna get your eyes right.

49:00.756 --> 49:03.676
You two, scram!
You're defacing city property.

49:03.884 --> 49:06.178
- Oh, shit.
- What are you talking about?

49:06.388 --> 49:08.932
This was just a crappy wall
and now it's a work of art.

49:09.141 --> 49:10.559
You want me to come down there?

49:10.767 --> 49:14.479
Please do come down.
You'll scuff up them shiny black boots.

49:14.688 --> 49:15.897
Idiot.

49:16.106 --> 49:18.859
Shit! Come on, you don't want to
get in trouble with the law.

49:19.067 --> 49:21.403
- Let's go!
- Go! Go, go, go.

49:24.614 --> 49:26.533
Jude, Jude, come here. Come here.

49:54.562 --> 49:57.857
If I fell in love with you

49:59.192 --> 50:02.528
Would you promise to be true

50:03.988 --> 50:11.120
And help me understand

50:12.413 --> 50:16.501
'Cause I've been in love before

50:16.876 --> 50:20.546
And I found that love was more

50:21.547 --> 50:27.388
Than just holding hands

50:29.014 --> 50:36.522
If I give my heart to you

50:37.398 --> 50:44.905
I must be sure from the very start

50:45.739 --> 50:53.205
That you would love me
More than her

50:57.668 --> 51:02.841
If I trust in you

51:03.550 --> 51:09.514
Oh, please, don't run and hide

51:09.723 --> 51:14.769
If I love you too

51:16.104 --> 51:23.611
Oh, please, don't hurt my pride
Like her

51:24.738 --> 51:30.201
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain

51:32.120 --> 51:39.670
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

52:32.891 --> 52:34.101
So that's the way it is.

52:38.605 --> 52:40.983
Yeah. That's the way it is.

52:41.191 --> 52:45.028
Yeah, well, speaking as a brother,
I think she could do better.

52:45.904 --> 52:47.155
Max, get out.

52:47.364 --> 52:51.451
Well, excuse me, but as blissful as
you are in the throes of young love...

52:51.660 --> 52:54.746
...I'm just letting you know
I got a date with Uncle Sam.

53:26.279 --> 53:28.156
I want you

53:30.074 --> 53:33.745
I want you so bad

53:38.834 --> 53:41.545
I want you so bad

53:41.754 --> 53:43.714
It's drivin' me mad

55:20.688 --> 55:23.816
She's so...

55:25.484 --> 55:29.329
heavy...

55:29.364 --> 55:37.706
She's so heavy...

55:52.804 --> 55:55.182
Any reason you shouldn't
be in this man's Army, son?

55:55.390 --> 55:58.685
I'm a cross-dressing homosexual
pacifist with a spot on my lung.

55:59.019 --> 56:00.687
Long as you don't have flat feet.

56:05.901 --> 56:09.572
You know what really pisses me off?
Is I swallowed all those cotton balls...

56:09.781 --> 56:11.407
...and they never even
took an x-ray.

56:11.616 --> 56:14.118
- You still have options, man.
- Yeah, jail or Canada...

56:14.327 --> 56:15.662
...and they both suck.

56:15.870 --> 56:18.164
I mean, I could never come home.
So, what is it?

56:18.373 --> 56:22.794
It's a choice of a 6-by-4 cell or an
endless wasteland of frozen tundra.

56:23.002 --> 56:25.963
- Montreal's cool.
- Man, they speak French.

56:26.214 --> 56:28.383
So learn French.
Learn French or die.

56:28.418 --> 56:34.639
I want you

56:35.264 --> 56:38.601
I want you so bad

56:41.854 --> 56:44.857
I want you

56:45.692 --> 56:49.119
You know I want you so bad

56:49.154 --> 56:54.368
It's driving me mad it's driving me...

56:58.122 --> 56:59.915
You think Sadie knows?

57:01.667 --> 57:03.293
Knows what?

57:22.062 --> 57:23.522
Let me see.

57:25.942 --> 57:29.404
- No way.
- You look gorgeous.

57:29.571 --> 57:31.614
Sadie, come on. What...?

57:31.823 --> 57:35.452
- It's my band, honey.
- I can't wear this.

57:36.995 --> 57:40.415
It's Tuxedo Club. For my 'do.

57:42.292 --> 57:43.835
Yeah?

57:51.343 --> 57:53.803
- Cool.
- Don't start.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.930
What is it, Max?

57:57.265 --> 58:00.060
Prudence. Come on, sweet pea.

58:00.435 --> 58:01.603
We all love you.

58:01.811 --> 58:04.148
- How long's she been in there?
- All night, I guess.

58:05.483 --> 58:07.735
- Come on, Pru.
- What's going on?

58:07.943 --> 58:10.488
It's Prudence.
I think she's hung up on me.

58:14.075 --> 58:16.410
Dear Prudence

58:16.577 --> 58:18.871
Won't you come out to play?

58:20.831 --> 58:23.167
Dear Prudence

58:23.376 --> 58:28.964
Greet the brand-new day

58:31.300 --> 58:34.178
The sun is up, the sky is blue

58:34.387 --> 58:37.765
It's beautiful and so are you

58:37.807 --> 58:41.318
Dear Prudence

58:41.353 --> 58:46.566
want you come out to play?

58:47.192 --> 58:50.404
- Sadie, we gotta go.
- Later.

58:51.363 --> 58:56.785
Dear Prudence,
Open up your eyes...

58:57.828 --> 59:05.460
Dear Prudence, see the sunny sky...

59:08.380 --> 59:11.299
The wind is low...
The birds will sing

59:11.334 --> 59:14.636
That you're a part of everything

59:15.053 --> 59:24.647
Dear Prudence...
wont you open up your eyes?

59:28.276 --> 59:31.612
Look around...

59:31.821 --> 59:34.657
Round... round... round... round... round

59:35.074 --> 59:41.748
Round... round... round... round... round

59:53.926 --> 59:55.678
Dear Prudence...

59:59.558 --> 01:00:04.146
Greet a brand new day...

01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:13.495
the sun is up... the sky is blue...

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:19.870
- Our voice is our weapon, and united we will win!
... and so are you...

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:21.003
That's right, yeah!

01:00:21.038 --> 01:00:29.880
Dear Prudence...
- "You can crush the idealists",... why dont you come out and play?

01:00:30.089 --> 01:00:34.426
The Americans are forcing even their
friends into becoming their enemies.

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:37.389
Round... round... round... round... round
Every day the hatred increases...

01:00:38.431 --> 01:00:40.684
...in the hearts of the Vietnamese who want us out!
Round... round... round... round... round...

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:47.273
The image of America
will never again...

01:00:47.482 --> 01:00:52.737
...be the image of revolution,
freedom and democracy...

01:00:52.946 --> 01:00:55.407
...but the image
of violent imperialism!

01:00:57.742 --> 01:01:01.079
Hey, Luce! Luce, come on,
stop worrying about it.

01:01:01.246 --> 01:01:02.122
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:04.791
I could go in the Army
and not get shipped to anywhere.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.419
Play a lot of cards, learn how to box.

01:01:07.627 --> 01:01:10.130
Come on, look at this.
It's happening everywhere, man.

01:01:10.338 --> 01:01:14.301
Maybe LBJ will have a change of heart
and call the whole thing off, huh?

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:17.138
This war is totally immoral!

01:01:23.185 --> 01:01:26.397
- As soon as possible.
- Yeah, I can get it.

01:01:26.605 --> 01:01:28.733
Paco. This is Lucy Carrigan.

01:01:28.941 --> 01:01:30.860
She's an old friend.
She's not a student...

01:01:31.068 --> 01:01:33.321
...but she's interested in what we do.
Wanted to meet you.

01:01:33.529 --> 01:01:34.739
- Paco.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:34.947 --> 01:01:36.365
How'd you hear about us?

01:01:36.574 --> 01:01:40.036
I saw you at the Fifth Avenue peace
march. I was really moved by your speech.

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:49.754
I'm thinking of renting the spare room
since Prudence split.

01:01:50.963 --> 01:01:52.174
Jesus, Max.

01:01:52.382 --> 01:01:55.177
Well, she's Prudence. She'll show.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.725
You're up before 2 and
looking wicked cool. Who's it for?

01:02:01.933 --> 01:02:05.604
- I have a meeting.
- Why, is that a prayer meeting?

01:02:06.146 --> 01:02:08.690
Yeah, for your twisted soul.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:13.362
- Put my shirt away when you're done.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:02:20.535 --> 01:02:22.037
What the hell was that?

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:24.498
That's Dr. Robert.

01:02:25.707 --> 01:02:27.417
He's here to plug his book.

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:29.503
Spread the word.

01:02:30.087 --> 01:02:32.548
There's a party for him tonight
if you wanna join me.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.510
We could celebrate.

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.553
I haven't said yes yet, Bill.

01:02:37.762 --> 01:02:39.889
Sign with my label.

01:02:40.098 --> 01:02:43.851
I'll put you in a studio within a month
and get you a publishing deal.

01:02:45.645 --> 01:02:50.066
It sounds fantastic, man. But I still
gotta talk it over with the guys.

01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:52.360
No, you don't.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:09.211
- Whose place is this?
- Luna Park, Dr. Robert's publisher.

01:03:10.462 --> 01:03:13.841
There she is. Luna!

01:03:14.633 --> 01:03:17.970
Bill, good to see you.

01:03:18.178 --> 01:03:19.680
Luna Park.

01:03:19.972 --> 01:03:23.392
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- This is Sadie.

01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:27.980
Fabulous singer and future star,
if she's smart and signs with me.

01:03:28.188 --> 01:03:29.982
Oh, look at this, pink punch.

01:03:32.818 --> 01:03:34.528
Cheers.

01:03:35.362 --> 01:03:38.032
- You're not listening.
- Your guitar sound is a little lazy.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.868
- We need it tighter, not slick.
- This band gets behind me.

01:03:41.076 --> 01:03:45.205
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Dr. Robert.

01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:53.882
Time is not on our hands, people.

01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:57.135
Time is slipping through them.

01:03:57.344 --> 01:04:01.890
We gotta transcend the bullshit,
and fast.

01:04:02.098 --> 01:04:07.354
But, hey, no point butting your heads
bucking the system.

01:04:08.229 --> 01:04:11.650
Let them get all snarled up
in their dreary hive.

01:04:12.525 --> 01:04:15.570
Never knock the way
another cat swings, man.

01:04:22.369 --> 01:04:25.038
Hate to mess with your groove,
New York...

01:04:25.247 --> 01:04:28.376
...but we're about two years
ahead of you on the coast.

01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:32.546
We already graduated
from what's been going on...

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:34.840
...to where it's gone.

01:04:36.717 --> 01:04:37.677
Amen.

01:04:40.096 --> 01:04:43.224
I am he as you are he

01:04:43.259 --> 01:04:44.732
As you are me

01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:48.611
And we are all together

01:04:48.646 --> 01:04:50.523
See how they run like pigs from a gun

01:04:51.023 --> 01:04:53.442
See how they fly

01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:56.028
I'm crying

01:04:56.654 --> 01:04:59.156
Sitting on a cornflake

01:05:00.116 --> 01:05:03.537
Waiting for the van to come

01:05:04.162 --> 01:05:05.956
Corporation tea shed

01:05:06.581 --> 01:05:08.006
Stupid bloody Tuesday

01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:12.713
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

01:05:12.838 --> 01:05:15.132
I am the egg man

01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:17.843
They are the egg men

01:05:18.051 --> 01:05:21.596
I am the walrus goo goo go choo

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.682
Mister city policeman sitting

01:05:24.099 --> 01:05:29.104
Pretty little policeman in the road

01:05:29.187 --> 01:05:32.441
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess

01:05:32.941 --> 01:05:34.109
Boy you've been a naughty girl

01:05:34.192 --> 01:05:37.362
You let your knickers down

01:05:37.446 --> 01:05:39.531
I am the egg man

01:05:40.282 --> 01:05:42.577
They are the egg men

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.122
I am the walrus goo goo go choo

01:05:52.378 --> 01:05:55.089
Sitting in an English garden

01:05:55.173 --> 01:05:57.383
Waiting for the sun

01:05:58.718 --> 01:06:04.891
If the sun don't come you get a tan
from standing in the English rain

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:06.976
I am the egg man

01:06:07.477 --> 01:06:09.771
They are the egg men

01:06:10.104 --> 01:06:14.150
I am the walrus goo goo go choo...

01:06:21.575 --> 01:06:24.703
Experts texperts choking smokers

01:06:24.787 --> 01:06:28.332
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:32.836
See how they smile like pigs in a sty

01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:35.756
See how they snide

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.007
I'm crying

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:41.053
Semolina Pilchard

01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:45.731
climbing up the Eiffel Tower

01:06:45.766 --> 01:06:49.568
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna

01:06:49.603 --> 01:06:53.357
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

01:06:54.942 --> 01:06:56.485
I am the eggman

01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:59.197
They are the eggmen

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:01.533
I am the walrus goo goo go choo...

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:21.761
Nice. Nice.

01:07:22.178 --> 01:07:27.183
Love the people. Love the people.
We love the people.

01:07:49.707 --> 01:07:50.958
Where are we?

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:55.129
I don't know.
And I don't know how we got here.

01:07:55.755 --> 01:07:57.340
What is that place?

01:07:57.548 --> 01:08:00.718
Headquarters of
the League of Spiritual Deliverance.

01:08:00.926 --> 01:08:03.679
The home of Dr. Geary.

01:08:03.888 --> 01:08:08.684
Another outlaw like myself.
We're navigators.

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:11.645
We're aviators. We're...

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:14.690
...eating taters.
Masturbating alligators.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.527
Bombardiers, we got no fears,
won't shed no tears.

01:08:17.736 --> 01:08:20.197
We're pushing the frontiers...

01:08:20.404 --> 01:08:23.075
...of transcendental perception.

01:08:23.283 --> 01:08:27.537
What's weird is we haven't met yet...

01:08:27.746 --> 01:08:30.666
...on this or any other plane.
- Hey, doc.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:33.877
- He says he won't see you, man.
- Why, is he sick?

01:08:34.086 --> 01:08:36.380
He just said he's busy.

01:08:38.006 --> 01:08:40.716
Did you tell that son of a bitch...

01:08:40.926 --> 01:08:44.595
...that we drove 3000 miles
to see him?

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:49.559
- All right, everybody back on the bus.
- What?

01:08:49.768 --> 01:08:51.853
We're going home. California.

01:08:52.062 --> 01:08:53.356
- Doc?
- We just got here.

01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:55.733
- California isn't home to all of us.
- Yeah.

01:08:55.942 --> 01:09:01.238
What can I say? You're either
on the bus or off the bus.

01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:07.286
- Sayonara!
- Screw you!

01:09:07.495 --> 01:09:08.955
Oh, well, that's just perfect.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.082
My last blowout before the Army,
we're stuck in the middle of...

01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:15.377
- Where are we, huh?
- It doesn't matter.

01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:20.133
"I am me as you are he as you are
me and we are all together. "

01:09:20.341 --> 01:09:21.926
That is so right. That's right.

01:09:22.135 --> 01:09:27.682
You know, and if nobody's everybody
then someone can be anybody, right?

01:09:29.142 --> 01:09:31.854
Listen. Do you hear the music?

01:09:37.776 --> 01:09:40.821
- Where are we going?
- We're going out of our minds.

01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:43.032
Come on, this way.

01:09:43.573 --> 01:09:46.076
- Where are you taking me?
- Down the rabbit hole.

01:09:46.118 --> 01:09:49.371
- Oh, I wanna feed the cow.
- Let's go.

01:09:49.747 --> 01:09:52.957
Oh, my God, Jude.

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.627
Now, that's big.

01:10:21.905 --> 01:10:24.240
For the benefit of Mr. Kite

01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:28.370
There will be a show tonight
On trampoline

01:10:31.081 --> 01:10:35.293
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair

01:10:35.502 --> 01:10:38.254
Have you seen it?
It's great, they got stuff.

01:10:38.463 --> 01:10:40.507
Over men and horses
Hoops and garters

01:10:40.715 --> 01:10:43.843
Lastly through a hogshead
Of real fire

01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:47.931
In this way
Mr. K. Will challenge the world

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.437
With the blue people. They're great.
They're just chilled out.

01:10:58.109 --> 01:10:59.992
I better heat you up.

01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:04.115
The celebrated Mr K
performs his feat on Saturday

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:05.992
At Bishopsgate

01:11:07.952 --> 01:11:10.162
The Henderson's are gonna dance and sing

01:11:10.197 --> 01:11:13.082
As Mr Kite flies through the ring

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:14.959
Don't be late

01:11:18.379 --> 01:11:21.424
Messrs. K and H. assure the public

01:11:21.507 --> 01:11:24.135
Their production is second to none

01:11:24.635 --> 01:11:28.932
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:36.982
Is that Prudence?

01:11:38.066 --> 01:11:38.984
It is!

01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:43.989
Prudence!

01:11:44.531 --> 01:11:45.657
Hi, guys!

01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:58.135
The band begins at ten to six

01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:02.966
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound

01:12:04.301 --> 01:12:06.144
And Mr. H. will demonstrate

01:12:06.179 --> 01:12:10.558
Ten somersets he's gonna do on solid ground

01:12:13.269 --> 01:12:15.041
Having been some days in preparation

01:12:15.076 --> 01:12:16.814
A splendid time is guaranteed for all

01:12:17.648 --> 01:12:21.402
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

01:12:44.176 --> 01:12:45.969
Oh, man, that was amazing.

01:12:46.178 --> 01:12:49.139
That was bizarre, yo. That was...

01:12:51.141 --> 01:12:53.644
- Look at you, sweet pea.
- It's good to see you.

01:12:53.894 --> 01:12:56.397
- You too.
- Oh, I want you to meet Rita.

01:12:56.432 --> 01:12:59.274
- She's a contortionist.
- Oh, yea.

01:13:14.707 --> 01:13:19.712
Because the world is round...

01:13:19.747 --> 01:13:25.343
It turns me on...

01:13:27.095 --> 01:13:35.979
Because the world is round.

01:13:44.446 --> 01:13:49.868
Because the wind is high...

01:13:49.903 --> 01:13:56.750
It blows my mind...

01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:05.176
Because the wind is high.

01:14:13.642 --> 01:14:20.149
Love is old, love is new.

01:14:20.232 --> 01:14:25.696
Love is all, love is you.

01:14:26.739 --> 01:14:31.744
Because the sky is blue

01:14:31.779 --> 01:14:38.210
It makes me cry

01:14:38.418 --> 01:14:48.345
Because the sky is blue

01:16:05.007 --> 01:16:08.469
Blood! Down! Down!

01:16:08.504 --> 01:16:10.387
Down!

01:17:07.237 --> 01:17:09.322
What time do you finish?

01:17:09.357 --> 01:17:10.740
I don't know.

01:17:12.868 --> 01:17:14.412
I love you.

01:17:31.762 --> 01:17:39.311
Something in the way she moves

01:17:39.854 --> 01:17:43.983
Attracts me like no other lover

01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:51.283
Something in the way she woos me

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:59.916
I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe, in how

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:11.386
Somewhere in her smile she knows

01:18:11.595 --> 01:18:17.351
That I don't need no other lover.

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:24.649
Something in her style, that shows me

01:18:25.692 --> 01:18:31.949
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how.

01:18:41.376 --> 01:18:52.887
You're asking me, will my love grow,
I don't know... I don't know

01:18:55.973 --> 01:19:07.403
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know... I don't know

01:19:18.831 --> 01:19:20.624
Hey, you didn't get
my left nipple right.

01:19:20.916 --> 01:19:22.084
Oh, is that so?

01:19:23.794 --> 01:19:25.546
Well, you know,
you were lying on your side...

01:19:26.714 --> 01:19:28.257
...and I was drawing from a distance.

01:19:29.258 --> 01:19:32.553
So I couldn't see it properly.

01:19:44.399 --> 01:19:47.110
What time is it?

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.405
- Eleven o'clock, I think.
- I gotta run.

01:19:51.406 --> 01:19:53.581
You didn't get in till half passed two.

01:19:53.616 --> 01:19:56.911
You know Columbia's top scientists are
working for the Defense Department?

01:19:56.946 --> 01:19:58.920
I didn't, no.

01:19:58.955 --> 01:20:01.124
There's gonna be this demonstration
on the campus to protest it.

01:20:01.159 --> 01:20:04.627
Paco says we need to radicalize.

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:06.671
It's not enough
to just hand out leaflets...

01:20:06.755 --> 01:20:10.091
...and lie down in the middle of the
street and give flowers to cops.

01:20:11.426 --> 01:20:15.013
Well, will he give you time off
to go to Sadie's gig? Which is tonight.

01:20:16.514 --> 01:20:17.557
I'll try.

01:20:19.851 --> 01:20:21.728
Well, can you try harder?

01:20:25.399 --> 01:20:29.737
I can't believe you're telling me this.
And the rest of the guys?

01:20:29.772 --> 01:20:33.449
- I tried to tell you this a million times.
- So this is it?

01:20:33.484 --> 01:20:36.285
Oh, darlin'

01:20:36.369 --> 01:20:40.164
Please believe me

01:20:40.498 --> 01:20:46.545
I'll never do you no harm

01:20:48.589 --> 01:20:52.927
Believe me when I tell you

01:20:53.552 --> 01:20:58.974
I'll never do you no harm

01:21:03.063 --> 01:21:06.525
- Oh, darlin'
- Oh, darlin'

01:21:07.067 --> 01:21:11.238
- If you leave me
- If you leave me

01:21:11.738 --> 01:21:15.909
I'll never make it alone

01:21:16.451 --> 01:21:17.994
I doubt that.

01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:21.665
Oh, believe me when I beg you

01:21:22.165 --> 01:21:27.212
Don't ever leave me alone

01:21:27.963 --> 01:21:31.091
All alone

01:21:33.176 --> 01:21:36.304
When you told me

01:21:37.347 --> 01:21:41.519
You didn't need me anymore

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:46.502
Hey, where you going?

01:22:47.211 --> 01:22:49.713
Where were we?

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:15.532
Oh, yeah, that's right, baby.
I don't need you. I'm gonna show you.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.591
What the hell happened, man?
Where'd Sadie go?

01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:15.302
Solo, man. Way solo.

01:24:39.326 --> 01:24:43.705
Hey, how's it going? Hope we're
not interrupting the creative flow.

01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:49.009
Still life?

01:24:49.044 --> 01:24:50.880
Yeah, yeah, it's...

01:24:52.298 --> 01:24:54.592
I'm sorry, what's that doing here?

01:24:54.676 --> 01:24:57.762
Well, you don't have one.
I had a spare.

01:24:57.804 --> 01:25:00.556
Where should I put it?

01:25:01.099 --> 01:25:02.225
Right here is fine for now.

01:25:03.309 --> 01:25:05.395
They're transmitting
live from Vietnam now.

01:25:06.396 --> 01:25:08.398
It's gonna make a difference.

01:25:08.606 --> 01:25:10.274
Bringing the war
right in the people's living room.

01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:13.820
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,
mate, but this isn't a living room.

01:25:16.447 --> 01:25:17.782
This is where I work.

01:25:26.416 --> 01:25:30.087
I'm sorry, he must really
be caught up with what he's doing.

01:25:31.422 --> 01:25:32.381
There you go.

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.637
You should probably
try to get an outside antenna.

01:25:39.972 --> 01:25:41.974
I gotta go. You'll be there later?

01:25:42.266 --> 01:25:43.642
Yeah.

01:25:55.612 --> 01:25:58.657
Saigon command disclosed
that 5000 more U.S. Troops...

01:25:58.692 --> 01:26:02.161
...were committed to the war
last week...

01:26:02.286 --> 01:26:04.997
...bringing American troop strength
to over half a million men.

01:26:05.032 --> 01:26:07.083
The Vietcong assault
on South Vietnam cities...

01:26:07.118 --> 01:26:09.676
...produced record casualties
last week.

01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:12.297
Four hundred sixteen
Americans were killed...

01:26:12.332 --> 01:26:15.932
...and 15,029 wounded...

01:26:15.967 --> 01:26:18.553
...raising total U.S. Combat fatalities
in this country's longest war...

01:26:18.588 --> 01:26:21.181
...to 30,057.

01:26:23.558 --> 01:26:30.982
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to

01:26:31.608 --> 01:26:34.611
Strawberry Fields

01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:39.407
Nothing is real

01:26:40.158 --> 01:26:43.912
And nothing to get hung about

01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:48.834
Strawberry Fields forever

01:26:49.752 --> 01:26:55.299
Living is easy with eyes closed

01:26:56.425 --> 01:27:00.304
Misunderstanding all you see

01:27:01.138 --> 01:27:06.560
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out

01:27:07.395 --> 01:27:11.649
It doesn't matter much to me

01:27:12.483 --> 01:27:19.990
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to

01:27:20.025 --> 01:27:24.804
Strawberry Fields

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:29.549
Nothing is real

01:27:29.584 --> 01:27:34.172
And nothing to get hung about

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:38.760
Strawberry Fields forever

01:27:41.888 --> 01:27:47.310
Always, No sometimes I think it's me

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:52.733
But you know I know when it's a dream

01:27:52.941 --> 01:27:59.197
I think you know I mean oh yes but it's all wrong

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:02.660
That is, I think I disagree

01:28:04.537 --> 01:28:10.585
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:14.630
Strawberry Fields

01:28:15.048 --> 01:28:20.560
Nothing is real

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:27.998
And nothing to get hung about

01:28:28.033 --> 01:28:35.401
Strawberry Fields forever

01:29:42.137 --> 01:29:44.222
I got a job

01:29:44.889 --> 01:29:47.809
You know, as in,
"We'll pay you to do it. "

01:29:48.768 --> 01:29:51.271
I thought you'd be pleased.

01:29:52.439 --> 01:29:54.190
What job?

01:29:54.232 --> 01:29:56.944
It's a logo
for Sadie's record company.

01:29:57.653 --> 01:29:58.779
It's a strawberry.

01:30:00.781 --> 01:30:05.161
You know, red, juicy, sexy.

01:30:06.912 --> 01:30:07.872
Yeah, get it? No?

01:30:10.791 --> 01:30:12.960
Why were you so rude
to Paco before?

01:30:14.754 --> 01:30:17.465
It wouldn't have killed you
to talk to him. He's got a good mind.

01:30:18.299 --> 01:30:20.384
He's committed,
he's involved, he's...

01:30:20.926 --> 01:30:22.553
- A shagger.
- A what?

01:30:22.678 --> 01:30:26.223
A shagger. A Don Juan.

01:30:27.266 --> 01:30:29.560
A seducer
of young, vulnerable women.

01:30:31.645 --> 01:30:33.314
Jude, you know nothing about him.

01:30:34.148 --> 01:30:36.860
Every time I go to your place,
there's about 50 people there.

01:30:37.611 --> 01:30:40.197
There's one bloke licking stamps
and the other 49 are...

01:30:40.405 --> 01:30:42.491
- Oh, they're all female.
- Don't exaggerate.

01:30:42.824 --> 01:30:44.785
Trust me, I'm not.

01:30:49.373 --> 01:30:53.126
We're in the middle of a revolution.
What are you doing, doodles and cartoons?

01:30:56.755 --> 01:30:58.465
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No?

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.926
No? Well, what did you mean?

01:31:01.343 --> 01:31:03.762
Sorry I'm not the man with
the megaphone, this is what I do.

01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:06.181
You could at least hear
what he has to say.

01:31:07.099 --> 01:31:09.685
I suppose you don't, because
you're never gonna be drafted.

01:31:09.935 --> 01:31:11.770
Nor will you, Lucy.

01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.067
I would lie down in front of a tank, if it
would stop this war and bring Max home.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.112
Yeah? Well, it wouldn't.

01:31:19.278 --> 01:31:22.115
What do you mean, it wouldn't?
You don't think that it's worth trying?

01:31:23.282 --> 01:31:24.951
I didn't say that. I'm...

01:31:25.034 --> 01:31:28.871
Well, maybe when bombs
start going off here, people will listen.

01:31:45.263 --> 01:31:50.893
You say you want a revolution,
Well, you know

01:31:52.354 --> 01:31:54.815
We all wanna change the world

01:31:54.857 --> 01:31:56.650
Jude, what are you doing?
I can't do this right now.

01:31:56.692 --> 01:32:02.448
You tell me that it's evolution,
Well, you know

01:32:04.158 --> 01:32:07.077
Yeah, we all wanna change the world

01:32:07.161 --> 01:32:09.455
Jude, please. Please, don't.

01:32:10.581 --> 01:32:13.709
But when you talk about destruction

01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:16.754
Don't you know
That you can count me out?

01:32:16.837 --> 01:32:20.174
- What the hell, you're doing here, friend?
- It's not the time. Not now.

01:32:20.215 --> 01:32:21.807
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right

01:32:21.842 --> 01:32:25.179
- Escort him to the door. Thank you.
- I'm sorry. Come on, let's go.

01:32:27.681 --> 01:32:29.684
Come on, let's go.

01:32:32.395 --> 01:32:34.481
I've never seen him like that.
I don't know.

01:32:35.315 --> 01:32:38.860
You say you change the Constitution

01:32:38.895 --> 01:32:41.363
Well, you know

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.614
You gotta leave, buddy. Come on.

01:32:43.448 --> 01:32:46.785
- Jude!
- Who is this asshole?

01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:54.292
You tell me it's the Institution well, you know

01:32:54.501 --> 01:32:59.679
You better free your mind instead

01:32:59.714 --> 01:33:04.636
but if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao

01:33:04.671 --> 01:33:09.100
You aint gonna make it with anyone anyhow

01:33:09.135 --> 01:33:09.934
Jesus!

01:33:10.976 --> 01:33:11.727
Are you okay?

01:33:12.436 --> 01:33:14.105
Get this clown out of here now!

01:33:15.648 --> 01:33:16.607
Get him out of here!

01:33:23.906 --> 01:33:26.617
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

01:33:26.659 --> 01:33:27.493
All right!

01:33:38.087 --> 01:33:39.672
All right!

01:33:44.969 --> 01:33:47.597
What is the matter with you?
Why would you do that?

01:34:19.713 --> 01:34:21.673
...that all men are created equal.

01:34:21.798 --> 01:34:24.384
Memphis is a confused
and shocked city tonight.

01:34:24.468 --> 01:34:25.970
No one can believe
what has happened.

01:34:26.054 --> 01:34:28.890
It's been just a little over an hour...

01:34:29.057 --> 01:34:32.393
...since Dr. Martin Luther King died
from an assassin's bullet.

01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:37.106
He died from a gunshot wound
in the neck.

01:34:37.231 --> 01:34:39.192
I'm sick and tired of violence.

01:34:39.317 --> 01:34:41.277
I'm tired of the war in Vietnam.

01:34:49.327 --> 01:34:53.790
I look at you all

01:34:53.915 --> 01:34:59.128
See the love there that's sleeping

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:05.052
While my guitar gently weeps

01:35:07.346 --> 01:35:10.474
I look at the floor

01:35:11.517 --> 01:35:15.270
And I see it needs sweeping

01:35:16.939 --> 01:35:22.861
Still my guitar gently weeps

01:35:24.655 --> 01:35:29.368
I don't know why

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.539
Nobody told you

01:35:34.498 --> 01:35:36.632
How to unfold your love

01:35:36.667 --> 01:35:41.548
The sound sucks out there.
How many times...?

01:35:41.589 --> 01:35:45.051
Get out there and tell Tony to fix it
or I don't go on tomorrow night.

01:35:45.093 --> 01:35:48.430
Come on, Sadie,
it's the ratty end of the tour. Cool it.

01:35:48.465 --> 01:35:50.014
Someone controlled you

01:35:50.348 --> 01:35:52.434
Find me someone
who can play the guitar, man.

01:35:52.517 --> 01:35:54.894
This new guy's
got no soul, he stinks.

01:35:58.023 --> 01:36:02.158
I look at the world

01:36:02.193 --> 01:36:08.241
And I notice it's turning

01:36:08.276 --> 01:36:14.289
While my guitar gently weeps

01:36:16.082 --> 01:36:25.468
With every mistake we must surely be learning

01:36:25.885 --> 01:36:32.558
Still my guitar gently weeps

01:36:51.535 --> 01:36:55.373
I look at you all

01:37:00.921 --> 01:37:08.095
Still my guitar gently weeps

01:37:34.037 --> 01:37:35.372
Do you wanna come up
for one more, Jo?

01:37:37.792 --> 01:37:39.460
I ain't gonna find Sadie there, man.

01:37:40.795 --> 01:37:42.130
You better go on up to Lucy.

01:37:42.171 --> 01:37:43.131
Yeah.

01:37:45.383 --> 01:37:47.593
Well, she's probably out
fighting for the cause, you know?

01:37:48.553 --> 01:37:53.975
It look like you been
fighting for it too, huh?

01:37:54.183 --> 01:37:55.601
I don't have one.
That's the problem.

01:38:57.457 --> 01:39:03.470
Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup

01:39:03.505 --> 01:39:09.719
They slither while they pass, they slip away
Across the universe

01:39:11.012 --> 01:39:17.102
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my open mind

01:39:17.143 --> 01:39:20.355
Possessing and caressing me

01:39:20.397 --> 01:39:28.613
Jai Guru Deva

01:39:28.738 --> 01:39:31.534
Om

01:39:32.201 --> 01:39:37.748
Nothing's gonna change my world

01:39:38.457 --> 01:39:42.962
Nothing's gonna change my world

01:39:44.797 --> 01:39:51.595
Images of broken light, which dance
before me like a million eyes

01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:55.766
They call me on and on
Across the universe

01:39:57.768 --> 01:40:03.614
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letterbox

01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:10.365
They tumble blindly as they
Make their way across the universe

01:40:12.117 --> 01:40:16.455
Strike! Strike! Strike!

01:40:21.168 --> 01:40:26.715
Nothing's gonna change my world

01:40:27.466 --> 01:40:34.056
Nothing's gonna change my world

01:41:10.134 --> 01:41:17.266
No! No!

01:41:31.865 --> 01:41:34.159
Lucy!

01:41:34.868 --> 01:41:37.204
- Jude!
- Lucy!

01:42:40.602 --> 01:42:44.690
Nothing's gonna change my world

01:42:45.816 --> 01:42:49.904
Nothing's gonna change my world

01:42:52.198 --> 01:43:03.793
Jai Guru Deva

01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:05.773
You have a visitor.

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.783
- What are you doing here?
- I got a call from a friend of yours, a girl.

01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:19.495
Said that you were in trouble,
so I came down.

01:44:20.371 --> 01:44:21.247
Are you all right?

01:44:30.089 --> 01:44:33.718
I told the cops that I was a
U.S. Citizen and you were my son.

01:44:36.012 --> 01:44:39.099
- What did they say?
- They wanted proof.

01:44:40.726 --> 01:44:41.894
I didn't have any.

01:44:44.605 --> 01:44:48.984
I talked the cops out of pressing
charges for the riot and stuff...

01:44:49.359 --> 01:44:51.153
...but the bottom line,
this is an immigration issue.

01:44:51.403 --> 01:44:53.405
Meaning they're
kicking me out of the country?

01:44:53.489 --> 01:44:55.491
- I'm afraid so.
- Shit.

01:45:05.292 --> 01:45:06.877
Thanks... Thanks, for trying anyway.

01:45:12.508 --> 01:45:13.967
Have you told your mother
you met me?

01:45:17.305 --> 01:45:19.265
Not yet.

01:45:23.937 --> 01:45:25.647
But... But I will.

01:45:43.081 --> 01:45:45.083
Look who's coming.

01:45:48.336 --> 01:45:51.339
- How's it going, Jude?
- I'm okay, yeah.

01:45:52.382 --> 01:45:54.677
So when did you and Phil hitch up?

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.179
About two weeks
after you stopped writing.

01:45:59.765 --> 01:46:02.685
Oh, I'm pleased for you, though.
And a kid's on the way.

01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:03.936
That's great.

01:46:05.312 --> 01:46:08.232
- What was the name?
- Who?

01:46:08.274 --> 01:46:11.360
The reason you stopped writing.

01:46:13.946 --> 01:46:15.114
Her name was Lucy.

01:46:16.991 --> 01:46:19.910
It was... It was good
for a while, you know.

01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:23.372
It all seems a bit unreal.

01:46:23.456 --> 01:46:25.541
Is this real enough for you?

01:46:27.293 --> 01:46:29.211
Glad to be back?

01:46:29.503 --> 01:46:33.550
Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't be happier.

01:46:42.225 --> 01:46:47.230
She's not a girl
Who misses much

01:46:54.738 --> 01:46:59.534
She's well aquainted with the touch of a velvet hand

01:46:59.659 --> 01:47:04.004
Like a lizard on a window-pane

01:47:04.039 --> 01:47:11.339
The man in the crowd with the multi-coloured mirrors
And his hobnail boots

01:47:11.374 --> 01:47:17.852
Lying with his eyes while his hands appear he's working overtime

01:47:17.887 --> 01:47:25.520
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

01:47:25.812 --> 01:47:28.314
I'll be here same time next week,
okay?

01:47:41.577 --> 01:47:45.206
I need a fix
'Cause I'm going down

01:47:50.462 --> 01:47:55.634
I need a fix
'Cause I'm going down

01:47:55.718 --> 01:48:06.353
Mother Superior jumped the gun

01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:26.415
Happiness is a warm gun

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:34.758
Happiness is a warm gun

01:48:34.924 --> 01:48:39.137
When I hold you
In my arms

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:45.393
And when I feel
My finger on your trigger

01:48:45.428 --> 01:48:49.522
Nobody can do me no harm

01:48:49.731 --> 01:49:02.994
Happiness is a warm gun...

01:49:41.992 --> 01:49:45.247
Stop telling me this is a peaceful
march. It's much worse than that.

01:49:45.747 --> 01:49:47.714
The dogs and the violence...

01:49:47.749 --> 01:49:51.169
...and the people you're with are more
radical than you want me to believe.

01:49:51.211 --> 01:49:55.340
They should be radical. You should
be radical. We should all be radical.

01:49:55.507 --> 01:50:00.387
Daniel is dead
and Max is all fucked up...

01:50:00.429 --> 01:50:03.265
...and this war just keeps going
on and on and nobody's listening.

01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.941
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not listening.

01:50:05.976 --> 01:50:08.186
I just don't want
my beautiful daughter to get hurt.

01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:12.941
Look, Mom. Don't cry.

01:50:13.066 --> 01:50:15.026
Please don't cry.

01:50:16.278 --> 01:50:18.488
Everything's really okay here,
I promise.

01:50:22.785 --> 01:50:25.038
It's gonna be all right, I gotta go.

01:50:48.519 --> 01:50:51.564
It's gonna be

01:50:52.065 --> 01:50:53.524
Allright

01:50:55.318 --> 01:50:57.070
It's gonna be

01:50:57.987 --> 01:50:59.572
Allright

01:51:01.325 --> 01:51:02.701
It's gonna be

01:51:04.995 --> 01:51:05.913
Allright

01:52:15.567 --> 01:52:17.069
Close the door.

01:52:21.949 --> 01:52:24.160
I thought it was the other side
who dropped bombs.

01:52:56.985 --> 01:52:58.653
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks.

01:54:03.511 --> 01:54:07.348
Blackbird singing
In the dead of night

01:54:09.434 --> 01:54:14.982
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly

01:54:16.233 --> 01:54:20.195
All your life
You were only waiting

01:54:21.113 --> 01:54:28.120
For this moment to arise

01:54:31.665 --> 01:54:37.212
Blackbird fly

01:54:38.213 --> 01:54:43.343
Blackbird fly

01:54:44.386 --> 01:54:50.018
Into the light of the dark black night

01:55:25.178 --> 01:55:27.764
- Here, love.
- Thanks.

01:55:41.112 --> 01:55:43.406
Last call, pal.

01:55:55.793 --> 01:56:00.923
Hey, Jude
Don't make it bad

01:56:02.049 --> 01:56:08.014
Take a sad song
And make it better

01:56:09.558 --> 01:56:14.479
Remember
To let her into your heart

01:56:15.105 --> 01:56:21.069
Then you can start
To make it better

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:28.243
Hey, Jude
Don't be afraid

01:56:29.286 --> 01:56:34.916
You were made to go out and get her

01:56:36.376 --> 01:56:40.839
The minute you let her under your skin

01:56:41.798 --> 01:56:47.221
Then you begin to make it better

01:56:50.349 --> 01:56:53.603
And anytime you feel the pain

01:56:54.103 --> 01:57:00.359
Hey, Jude refrain
Don't carry the world

01:57:00.777 --> 01:57:04.739
Upon your shoulder

01:57:07.366 --> 01:57:10.161
Well you know that it's a fool

01:57:10.703 --> 01:57:13.206
Who plays it cool

01:57:14.123 --> 01:57:21.005
By making the world a little colder

01:57:22.048 --> 01:57:28.222
Na na na na na, na na na na!

01:57:30.808 --> 01:57:35.896
Hey, Jude
Don't let me down

01:57:37.398 --> 01:57:44.363
You have found her now go and get her

01:57:44.905 --> 01:57:48.951
Remermber to let her in to your heart

01:57:49.993 --> 01:57:55.833
Then you can start to make it better

01:57:55.874 --> 01:58:01.464
Better, better, better, better, better, Ah!

01:58:03.133 --> 01:58:07.595
Na na na, nanananana!

01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:10.932
Nanananana!

01:58:11.266 --> 01:58:12.851
Hey, Jude!

01:58:15.437 --> 01:58:21.484
Na na na, nanananana!

01:58:22.318 --> 01:58:24.529
Nanananana!

01:58:24.821 --> 01:58:26.489
Hey, Jude!

01:58:43.049 --> 01:58:47.887
Na na na, nanananana!

01:58:49.305 --> 01:58:51.098
Nanananana!

01:58:51.932 --> 01:58:53.809
Hey, Jude!

01:58:56.395 --> 01:59:00.816
- Max...
Na na na, nanananana!

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:04.653
Nanananana!

01:59:06.822 --> 01:59:07.907
You don't look too messed up.

01:59:08.199 --> 01:59:10.576
Yeah, well, everything
below the neck works fine.

01:59:14.747 --> 01:59:17.918
- Does she know?
- No.

01:59:18.210 --> 01:59:20.921
- You didn't tell her.
- Nope.

01:59:21.004 --> 01:59:22.589
All right, good. Good.

01:59:23.924 --> 01:59:26.725
Hey, this is your Cousin Brucie
at 720 WWEN...

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:29.888
...in a live broadcast
from the top of the world with...

01:59:33.225 --> 01:59:35.018
- Is that Sadie?
- You got that right.

01:59:35.602 --> 01:59:36.978
Shit, we're late.

01:59:41.566 --> 01:59:44.069
Don't let me down

01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:50.450
Don't let me down

01:59:52.702 --> 01:59:56.999
Nobody ever loved me like he does

02:00:05.341 --> 02:00:08.886
And if somebody loved me
Like she do me

02:00:10.763 --> 02:00:17.019
Ooh, she do me
Yes, she does

02:00:19.230 --> 02:00:22.316
Don't let me down

02:00:25.236 --> 02:00:28.906
Don't let me down

02:00:31.492 --> 02:00:34.329
Don't let me down

02:00:37.666 --> 02:00:40.169
Don't let me down

02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:12.786
Don't let me down

02:01:14.287 --> 02:01:18.625
Don't let me down

02:01:20.126 --> 02:01:22.378
- Yeah!
- Hey, Prudence.

02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:25.006
- How are you?
- Good. Welcome back.

02:01:25.131 --> 02:01:26.549
Where's Lucy?

02:01:26.883 --> 02:01:28.551
Don't know.
She should be on her way.

02:01:28.635 --> 02:01:31.388
- Did you give her the right address?
- Yeah. I thought I saw her on the street.

02:01:32.931 --> 02:01:34.391
Oh, shit.

02:01:35.308 --> 02:01:36.476
Let's go.

02:01:36.559 --> 02:01:38.526
Spread out.

02:01:38.561 --> 02:01:40.647
That's it. Wrap it up. Let's go.

02:01:50.448 --> 02:01:54.912
You have no permit. You're disturbing
the peace. Come on, off the roof.

02:01:56.288 --> 02:01:58.249
- Come on.
- Thank you!

02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:01.419
- Come on, let's go.
- Feels good to be back, baby.

02:02:01.454 --> 02:02:03.170
Yeah!

02:02:04.004 --> 02:02:05.589
Come on, we gotta clear the roof.
Let's go.

02:02:07.758 --> 02:02:10.052
- Hey. Be nice, be nice.
- All right. Keep moving.

02:02:10.511 --> 02:02:13.222
- Yeah, yeah.
- Joy. Happiness.

02:02:13.472 --> 02:02:15.439
That's right.
Background singers, huh?

02:02:15.474 --> 02:02:18.394
- Where did Jude go?
- I don't know. And where the hell is my sister?

02:02:18.429 --> 02:02:20.187
I'm sure I saw her, Max.

02:02:25.693 --> 02:02:29.156
Man, get your hands off me.

02:02:54.681 --> 02:02:57.309
There's nothing you can do
That can't be done

02:02:59.811 --> 02:03:02.606
Nothing you can sing
That can't be sung

02:03:04.733 --> 02:03:06.193
Nothing you can say

02:03:06.359 --> 02:03:09.072
But you can
Learn how to play the game

02:03:09.697 --> 02:03:10.948
Who the hell is that?

02:03:11.657 --> 02:03:12.492
- Jude?
- It's Jude.

02:03:14.994 --> 02:03:17.914
There's nothing you can make
That can't be made

02:03:19.832 --> 02:03:23.169
No one you can save
That can't be saved

02:03:24.587 --> 02:03:28.341
Nothing you can do but you can
Learn how to be you in time.

02:03:28.591 --> 02:03:30.760
It's easy.

02:03:33.596 --> 02:03:36.182
All you need is love!

02:03:38.351 --> 02:03:40.978
All you need is love!

02:03:43.064 --> 02:03:46.527
All you need is love!... love.

02:03:47.861 --> 02:03:49.863
...love is all you need.

02:03:49.947 --> 02:03:52.116
Hey kid, get your ass out of here!

02:03:52.408 --> 02:03:53.158
Let's go.

02:03:55.285 --> 02:03:59.296
Love... love... love!

02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:02.668
Nothing you can know that can't be known

02:04:04.545 --> 02:04:07.673
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.

02:04:10.384 --> 02:04:12.803
Nowhere you can be that isn't where
you're meant to be.

02:04:13.095 --> 02:04:15.305
It's easy.

02:04:17.891 --> 02:04:20.310
All you need is love!

02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:25.191
All you need is love!

02:04:27.694 --> 02:04:31.322
All you need is love... love... love!
- The roof is closed. The roof is closed.

02:04:31.865 --> 02:04:39.143
Love is all you need

02:04:39.178 --> 02:04:45.656
All you need is love...

02:04:45.691 --> 02:04:52.135
Love is all you need

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:21.662
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:05:44.898 --> 02:06:01.671
Lucy in the sky with diamonds...

02:06:01.706 --> 02:06:07.608
Picture yourself in a boat in a river

02:06:07.643 --> 02:06:13.475
With tangerine trees and marmelade sky

02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:19.976
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly

02:06:20.011 --> 02:06:25.398
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

02:06:25.690 --> 02:06:33.197
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green

02:06:33.232 --> 02:06:38.745
Towering over your head

02:06:38.828 --> 02:06:47.170
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone

02:06:47.205 --> 02:07:04.153
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

02:07:04.188 --> 02:07:10.701
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain

02:07:10.736 --> 02:07:17.534
Where rocking-horse people eat marshmallow pies

02:07:17.743 --> 02:07:22.206
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers

02:07:22.414 --> 02:07:28.378
That grow so incredibly high

02:07:30.756 --> 02:07:36.596
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore

02:07:36.631 --> 02:07:41.518
Waiting to take you away

02:07:43.478 --> 02:07:46.940
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

02:07:46.975 --> 02:07:49.616
And you're gone

02:07:49.651 --> 02:08:06.626
