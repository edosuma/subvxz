WEBVTT

00:04.513 --> 00:08.007
Hey! Great news. I'm on my
way to becoming a teacher.

00:08.031 --> 00:12.026
I filled out all my college
applications in Red pen.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.575
That's a little... that's,
like, a little teacher joke.

00:17.662 --> 00:19.199
Well, now look at him...

00:19.234 --> 00:22.496
out of bed and doing something
productive before noon.

00:22.532 --> 00:24.553
Honey, you're like a marine.

00:26.319 --> 00:27.442
A marine?

00:27.524 --> 00:32.051
The only time I ever saw him storm a beach
was when he was running away from a jellyfish.

00:33.212 --> 00:35.105
Hey, dad, all I
need from you now

00:35.162 --> 00:39.038
is a financial statement so the school
can see where I'm getting the old moola.

00:40.430 --> 00:41.982
Uh, well, um,

00:42.160 --> 00:44.503
bad news. I, uh...

00:44.543 --> 00:48.757
I spent your college money to
keep the muffler shop going.

00:49.425 --> 00:50.245
What?

00:50.635 --> 00:55.020
This is really weird, because my
parents, instead of paying for my college,

00:55.079 --> 00:56.592
bought me a muffler.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.634
Dad, how am I supposed
to pay for college?

01:01.669 --> 01:05.221
Look, with this damn mild
winter, nobody's muffler rusted.

01:05.257 --> 01:06.884
I tried to rust them.

01:06.924 --> 01:10.762
I went out at night and sprinkled
salt all over the streets.

01:11.231 --> 01:13.474
Not my good kosher salt.

01:14.308 --> 01:18.018
Yes, Kitty, I sprinkled
the streets of Point Place

01:18.041 --> 01:20.318
with your half-pound
bag of salt.

01:22.126 --> 01:23.770
Wait. Mom, you
knew about this?

01:23.793 --> 01:28.361
And you just said, "Please, go ahead. Take my
son's college money and use it on a muffler shop"?

01:28.384 --> 01:29.282
No.

01:32.088 --> 01:36.116
I think your father asked me if I
thought you would amount to anything,

01:36.151 --> 01:39.592
and I said, "I really,
really hope so."

01:41.147 --> 01:45.721
And then he said, "I'm spending Eric's
college money on my muffler shop."

01:45.757 --> 01:50.348
And then I made the best
blueberry cobbler I have ever made.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.273
Man, that was good.

01:53.175 --> 01:54.890
Best cobbler ever.

01:55.547 --> 01:56.381
Huh.

01:56.487 --> 01:58.119
I remember that cobbler.

01:58.741 --> 02:01.606
I always wondered why,
when I said it was so good,

02:01.676 --> 02:05.306
you said, "at least I can give
you this," and started to cry.

02:05.787 --> 02:07.807
Well, look at
the bright side.

02:07.842 --> 02:11.130
There's always a place for
you at a failing muffler shop.

02:13.558 --> 02:17.233
So the upshot is, I have
absolutely no money for college.

02:17.456 --> 02:20.474
Eric, don't worry. There are plenty
of ways to get money for school.

02:20.544 --> 02:23.125
Yeah, man. You could always
get a football scholarship.

02:24.205 --> 02:28.702
Hey, look, he weighs about as much as a
football, and people do like to kick him.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.233
I know what you should do.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.239
You should go to Hollywood and
become the next Gene Wilder.

02:35.437 --> 02:37.398
That guy's a laugh riot.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.800
Eric, you should
go see Mr. Bray.

02:40.847 --> 02:43.571
Finding money for college is what
high school guidance counselors do.

02:43.606 --> 02:47.094
Yeah, they also spend a lot of time
staring at themselves in the mirror saying,

02:47.129 --> 02:49.853
"I can't believe, I'm a high
school guidance counselor."

02:51.854 --> 02:54.930
I don't know about Mr. Bray. I
don't think he really liked me.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.725
One time I told him I was
being bullied, and he just said,

02:58.054 --> 02:59.545
"What'd you expect?"

03:01.529 --> 03:03.007
All right, I'll go with you.

03:03.512 --> 03:05.473
He'll help. He
totally loved me...

03:05.532 --> 03:08.209
in almost entirely
appropriate ways.

03:09.583 --> 03:10.463
Okay,

03:10.791 --> 03:14.361
I'm breaking up with Angie.
All we have anymore is hot sex.

03:15.406 --> 03:18.083
Hot sex? All I
have is hot soup.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.239
Can't make love to that.

03:22.260 --> 03:23.341
Too damn hot.

03:27.262 --> 03:29.528
So, Kelso, you gonna break
up with her your usual way...

03:29.564 --> 03:32.547
Send a note saying you got
kidnapped by kung fu robots?

03:33.839 --> 03:38.001
No, it won't work with her. She
doesn't even believe in kung fu robots.

03:39.798 --> 03:41.476
Just gonna have
to talk to her.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.625
Whoa! Kelso,

03:43.825 --> 03:46.267
you never break up
with a girl to her face.

03:46.302 --> 03:48.427
You usually have me
tell her you're dead.

03:49.566 --> 03:51.894
And then when she
eventually sees you,

03:51.930 --> 03:54.207
you have me tell
her you're a ghost.

03:55.851 --> 03:58.270
Michael, why don't you
do what you did with me?

03:58.552 --> 04:00.806
Toilet paper my house!

04:02.386 --> 04:03.901
I can't do that to Angie.

04:03.924 --> 04:07.564
I respect her too much 'cause she
agreed to have sex with me so fast.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.640
Look, I don't
care how you do it.

04:10.687 --> 04:13.293
I'm just happy you won't be
violating my sister anymore.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.315
Yeah, I know you
hated it, Hyde.

04:16.362 --> 04:20.355
I would have broken up with her sooner
if I didn't find it so hilarious.

04:23.337 --> 04:26.038
You be nice, or
I will marry her.

I'm so glad you

05:07.283 --> 05:09.923
Well, I missed you guys.
I'm not just your rich boss.

05:09.947 --> 05:11.766
I'm also your rich dad.

05:12.565 --> 05:16.275
In fact, everyone related to me,
grab some cash from the register.

05:17.739 --> 05:19.853
Uh, I've already been
in there once today.

05:21.367 --> 05:22.495
But you're the boss.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.285
Okay. I can do this.

05:29.543 --> 05:33.817
I'm just gonna tell Angie that things are
fizzling between us, and we should end it.

05:33.864 --> 05:36.318
- Hey, how's it going, sweets?
- Not bad, toots.

05:38.616 --> 05:40.178
Oh, him. Go, go, go.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.381
Okay. Well, um,

05:44.827 --> 05:46.448
we need to talk
about something.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.544
This might be kind
of hard to take.

05:51.845 --> 05:53.360
Fez still wets the bed.

05:53.383 --> 05:54.534
- What?
- Eww!

05:56.800 --> 06:00.089
At least we're still
together. I'll see you later.

06:01.274 --> 06:03.071
I'm going to wet your bed.

06:04.774 --> 06:10.496
Hey, Angie, can you recommend a record?
Something Dean Martiny, but not Dean Martin,

06:11.306 --> 06:14.359
because I don't like that he
didn't wave to me in Atlantic city.

06:15.345 --> 06:20.765
Well,  I don't know much about Dean Martin, but I do
know that the top-selling record this week is Blondie.

06:21.399 --> 06:22.573
Abroad, huh?

06:24.534 --> 06:25.834
Is she jazzy?

06:26.585 --> 06:28.241
Well, I know she's blonde.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.505
Here you go, bob.
Try this Joey Bishop.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.206
He swings like Dean, but
he'll wave at anybody.

06:36.711 --> 06:39.858
Good job knowing the
number one album, honey.

06:39.893 --> 06:41.467
I love watching
you in action,

06:41.502 --> 06:43.839
because the more you
work, the less I have to.

06:44.825 --> 06:48.923
Well, I'm just trying to get ready for the
day you kick the bucket, and I get everything.

06:50.483 --> 06:51.680
Just like her mother.

06:55.954 --> 06:57.246
Oh, my god.

06:57.434 --> 07:01.906
I can't believe I have to tell my high school guidance
counselor that I spent an entire year doing nothing.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.808
He's gonna think
I'm such a loser.

07:05.146 --> 07:07.459
Oh! Donna, let's
tell him it's you.

07:08.807 --> 07:11.484
No. You're a much
more believable loser.

07:12.435 --> 07:16.063
Oh, come on. He won't
judge you. He loves you.

07:16.592 --> 07:18.858
I mean, Jeez, he
asked you to prom.

07:21.851 --> 07:24.188
Okay, let's see...

07:24.411 --> 07:25.503
Donna.

07:28.203 --> 07:29.797
What a pleasant...

07:32.274 --> 07:34.035
Pleasant surprise.

07:35.667 --> 07:39.730
Jeez, you've done something different
with your hair since the prom.

07:41.221 --> 07:43.264
Yeah. You noticed.

07:43.299 --> 07:45.964
Well, I notice everything
about all my students.

07:46.869 --> 07:49.041
I put on a little weight.

07:49.628 --> 07:50.847
And you are?

07:52.491 --> 07:53.418
Eric.

07:54.217 --> 07:55.250
Forman.

07:55.426 --> 07:58.911
1977's most
improved mathlete.

07:59.956 --> 08:03.126
Oh, right. Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, Eric. I...

08:03.173 --> 08:05.263
I just figured the
bullies had gotten ya.

08:06.931 --> 08:11.592
Anyway, Donna here is looking
for some college scholarships.

08:11.674 --> 08:17.237
Well, Donna, you've come to the right place,
because I am an expert at college scholarships

08:17.272 --> 08:19.562
as well as the
affairs of the heart.

08:20.983 --> 08:24.059
Why don't you have just a little
seat right here, young lady?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.290
Thank you.

08:26.699 --> 08:29.082
Uh... I guess I'll, um...

08:35.179 --> 08:35.977
Great.

08:36.811 --> 08:40.873
So, Donna, to figure out what
scholarships you're eligible for,

08:40.919 --> 08:43.163
I'll have to know what
you've done for the last year.

08:43.250 --> 08:47.102
Oh. Um, well,
not a lot. I...

08:48.400 --> 08:50.252
Read comic books...

08:51.200 --> 08:53.283
Acted out movies
with my dolls...

08:53.323 --> 08:54.817
Action figures!

08:56.604 --> 09:00.010
You always insist that they
are called action figures.

09:00.526 --> 09:03.704
Jeez, that's... you know, if Eric had told
me he had wasted a whole year of his life,

09:03.736 --> 09:06.176
I wouldn't be surprised,
but... but you?

09:06.219 --> 09:08.649
I know. I'm just as
surprised as you are.

09:08.907 --> 09:12.298
It has been a long, ugly
fall. Very hard to watch.

09:13.026 --> 09:15.597
In fact, just between
you and me, she's

09:15.879 --> 09:18.497
even gotten into a little
bit of the smokey-smokey.

09:18.533 --> 09:19.576
All right.

09:20.973 --> 09:22.382
Screw this.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.237
The scholarship is for him.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.446
Eric, good luck.

09:25.470 --> 09:29.720
Mr. Bray, my coming here was not an
invitation to start driving by my house again.

09:31.293 --> 09:35.404
Hey, uh, my mother
lives right next door.

09:37.295 --> 09:39.044
I live right next door.

09:40.124 --> 09:41.827
Oh. Well...

09:42.931 --> 09:44.199
How's mother?

09:50.161 --> 09:51.957
Oh, my god! You guys,

09:52.404 --> 09:53.923
I just got a promotion.

09:53.955 --> 09:55.628
Daddy says I've been
doing such a great job

09:55.675 --> 09:58.911
that he wants me to move to Milwaukee
and help run the corporate office.

09:59.451 --> 10:02.967
Wait, what about Steven? He's
the one doing the great job.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.478
You just sit around doing your
nails and making smart-ass comments.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.625
Jackie, that's you.

10:11.562 --> 10:14.861
Yeah. Well, it's
annoying, now isn't it?

10:16.447 --> 10:19.439
How did you get a promotion? You
don't know anything about music.

10:19.580 --> 10:24.065
Last week a guy came in asking for Kiss. You
called him a pervert and slapped him in the face.

10:25.509 --> 10:28.230
Well, did your dad say
anything about Steven?

10:28.265 --> 10:32.879
I don't know. I just heard the word "promotion,"
and I got a little dizzy and sort of blacked out.

10:32.915 --> 10:34.922
It was awesome.

10:37.252 --> 10:41.772
Well, here's the america I know... the
person who can't do anything rises to the top,

10:41.819 --> 10:44.200
while the guy who's working
his ass off gets nothing.

10:44.224 --> 10:46.396
Are you supposed to be the
guy that works his ass off?

10:47.159 --> 10:49.449
Don't make this more
complicated than it has to be.

10:51.679 --> 10:53.299
Jackie! Listen,

10:53.745 --> 10:56.763
I need some advice on
breaking up with girls, okay?

10:56.774 --> 10:58.771
And you've been
broken up with a lot,

10:59.592 --> 11:01.612
and several times by me.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.559
So what didn't you like?

11:05.299 --> 11:10.172
Oh, um, the lying, the
cheating, the sneaking around.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.644
Oh, and I also didn't like Fez trying
to make out with me five minutes later.

11:15.795 --> 11:18.213
Well, then you're really
not gonna like this.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.145
Look, I don't know how
to break up with Angie.

11:22.181 --> 11:27.194
Well, why don't you try to figure out how
to do it kindly, maturely, respectfully?

11:27.415 --> 11:28.413
Yeah.

11:28.707 --> 11:30.010
- That sounds nice.
- Hmm.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.648
I think I'm just gonna
sleep with her best friend.

11:35.957 --> 11:36.708
Okay,

11:37.161 --> 11:39.852
I actually got some great news
from the guidance counselor.

11:39.892 --> 11:43.285
There's this program where you go and
teach in an impoverished area for a year,

11:43.320 --> 11:45.686
and then they pay
for your college.

11:45.721 --> 11:46.883
I signed up.

11:46.930 --> 11:48.727
- Eric, that's perfect.
- That's wonderful!

11:48.750 --> 11:53.283
See? I knew spending your college
money would work out for the best.

11:55.009 --> 11:56.280
You're welcome.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.601
So what impoverished
area will you go to?

12:00.907 --> 12:02.680
Is it east Milwaukee?

12:03.372 --> 12:08.186
I  made a wrong turn there once, and
I ended up in an awful neighborhood.

12:08.244 --> 12:12.359
There were kids playing
radios on a street corner.

12:13.862 --> 12:16.105
No, I'm not going
to Milwaukee.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.467
So where then?

12:17.831 --> 12:18.817
Africa!

12:21.936 --> 12:23.627
Africa, Wisconsin?

12:31.862 --> 12:33.969
You're going to
teach in Africa?

12:34.005 --> 12:37.257
What are you gonna teach 'em,
how to get eaten by an ostrich?

12:37.715 --> 12:39.300
Mom, an ostrich?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.478
I saw a documentary.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.636
They are vicious,
cruel creatures.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.862
Well, I think it's great
he's going to Africa.

12:49.897 --> 12:51.764
It'll make him a man.

12:51.805 --> 12:55.151
You think the only way
to become a man is to die.

12:56.313 --> 12:59.938
How are you gonna feel when
your son gets killed by a lion

12:59.974 --> 13:03.109
or a disease-carrying fly?

13:03.719 --> 13:07.128
You get killed by a fly, I'm
not buying you a headstone.

13:08.548 --> 13:10.685
You can't go to Africa.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.740
They don't even
have ketchup there.

13:13.198 --> 13:15.570
You put ketchup
on everything.

13:16.034 --> 13:18.300
You'll starve to death.

13:18.981 --> 13:21.142
Can you believe how
much she's freaking out?

13:21.165 --> 13:21.940
No.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.826
I cannot believe that someone
you supposedly love is upset

13:24.850 --> 13:28.689
that you decided to go to Africa
without considering her feelings at all!

13:30.949 --> 13:33.435
See? Donna understands.

13:38.203 --> 13:42.303
So there's a problem with my "sleeping
with Angie's best friend" plan.

13:42.526 --> 13:44.674
Angie's best friend is Hyde.

13:47.398 --> 13:49.465
You know what we
may have to do here?

13:49.712 --> 13:51.473
The dark room switch.

13:52.736 --> 13:55.108
You will make love
to her in a dark room.

13:55.143 --> 13:57.292
Halfway through, you
will excuse yourself.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.803
Then I'll come in, pretend
to be you and finish the job.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.279
And how does that
fix my problem?

14:06.112 --> 14:08.038
Oh. I was working
on my problem.

14:09.740 --> 14:14.290
You guys, Donna's totally freaking out about this
Africa thing. She won't return any of my calls.

14:14.325 --> 14:15.993
Think I have a solution.

14:17.719 --> 14:19.433
The dark room switch.

14:20.830 --> 14:23.613
Look, man, tell
Donna to just lay off,

14:23.660 --> 14:26.304
Okay? Africa is
gonna be awesome.

14:26.339 --> 14:30.014
You know, they have this bug over
there that burrows into your brain,

14:30.061 --> 14:32.926
and it lays, like,
a thousand eggs.

14:32.973 --> 14:37.973
And then when the eggs hatch, they, like,
shoot out of your head like little worm bullets.

14:39.358 --> 14:41.730
Kelso, those worms
aren't in Africa.

14:41.753 --> 14:43.632
They're on the
planet Zorgon,

14:44.150 --> 14:46.087
which is from a comic book

14:46.885 --> 14:48.107
that you wrote.

14:50.161 --> 14:52.181
Just trying to
generate a little buzz.

14:57.627 --> 14:58.648
W. B.,

14:59.646 --> 15:01.020
What the hell
were you thinking?

15:01.055 --> 15:04.261
I don't know. I thought I'd try
a new thing with my shoulders.

15:05.483 --> 15:08.642
Look, he means, why did you
promote that whore Angie?

15:10.368 --> 15:12.587
You mean my daughter Angie.

15:12.739 --> 15:14.982
I stand by my statement.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.736
You can't hit a girl.

15:20.777 --> 15:25.589
Look, if this is about me not being
professional, I've already told you...

15:25.624 --> 15:28.313
bottle rocket friday
nights are over.

15:29.076 --> 15:32.341
Steven, I'm moving Angie to Milwaukee
to get her away from the customers.

15:32.376 --> 15:36.707
I love my little girl, but you're the one who
should be running that store. So it's yours.

15:38.257 --> 15:39.055
Whoa.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.777
Uh, thanks, man.

15:43.129 --> 15:46.083
Oh, my god! I own
a record store!

15:48.537 --> 15:51.378
No, I own a record store.

15:52.188 --> 15:54.812
Actually, I own
a record store.

15:55.035 --> 15:58.064
I own one-third
of a record store!

15:59.109 --> 16:01.211
Moving Angie here is gonna
work out for everybody.

16:01.234 --> 16:05.262
See, I just got into this real snooty country
club, and they don't think I'm gonna be there much.

16:05.285 --> 16:07.892
But I'm gonna be there
all day, every day.

16:08.197 --> 16:10.017
And I'm bringing friends.

16:10.064 --> 16:12.657
So I need somebody around
here looking after things

16:12.692 --> 16:15.251
while I'm out making
white people uncomfortable.

16:22.156 --> 16:23.166
Hello?

16:23.377 --> 16:24.375
Oh, hi.

16:25.984 --> 16:30.528
How are ya? I'm Eric's guidance counselor.
I just came over with some papers for him.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.003
You look familiar.

16:32.132 --> 16:35.079
Do you live around here? 'Cause I see you
drive up and down the street all the time.

16:38.343 --> 16:41.898
Yeah, well, I see you emptying your
trash in your bathrobe all the time,

16:41.934 --> 16:43.902
but I keep it
to myself, okay?

16:44.963 --> 16:49.084
Eric, I brought you a brochure
with some survival tips, on Africa.

16:49.131 --> 16:50.117
Funny,

16:50.646 --> 16:54.380
They don't have brochures with
survival tips on Wisconsin.

16:55.202 --> 16:58.889
That's because death isn't
hiding behind every bush.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.018
Mom, please.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.860
I'm sorry if Eric's
trip has upset anyone.

17:03.883 --> 17:05.645
It's upset everyone.

17:05.714 --> 17:08.005
I'm not upset.
I'm tickled pink.

17:10.271 --> 17:12.996
What about Donna?
How's Donna doing?

17:14.499 --> 17:16.388
I don't know. She's
not even talking to me.

17:16.412 --> 17:22.340
Ah. Yeah, well, you know, sometimes I think she just
kind of lets her fiery emotions get the best of her.

17:22.987 --> 17:27.848
But I think maybe a gentle word
from me might just calm her down or

17:27.872 --> 17:30.279
send her into the
arms of someone else.

17:30.889 --> 17:33.904
You know what? You're
not gonna talk to her.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.065
I'm gonna go talk to her.

17:51.406 --> 17:53.496
So do you guys
have a daughter?

17:59.009 --> 17:59.748
Angie...

18:02.339 --> 18:04.029
I've been thinking
about this all day,

18:04.288 --> 18:06.706
and I finally
worked up the nerve.

18:06.953 --> 18:07.869
And

18:08.256 --> 18:10.581
I think we need
to talk about us.

18:10.759 --> 18:13.037
Michael, I'm
breaking up with you.

18:16.031 --> 18:16.946
How

18:17.052 --> 18:18.406
dare you?!

18:20.015 --> 18:22.022
I'm moving to Milwaukee.

18:22.598 --> 18:23.807
Milwau...

18:23.889 --> 18:26.364
well, when were
you gonna tell me,

18:26.552 --> 18:28.713
you know, your boyfriend?

18:29.570 --> 18:30.685
Come on.

18:30.721 --> 18:33.470
You know things were
sort of fizzling anyways.

18:33.505 --> 18:35.008
F-fizzling?

18:35.842 --> 18:37.239
How can you even say that?

18:37.263 --> 18:40.750
What about all the times you said that
I was really, really good-looking?

18:42.169 --> 18:44.893
Michael, it's over.
But know this...

18:44.917 --> 18:47.018
when I said you
were good-looking,

18:47.054 --> 18:49.014
I really meant it.

18:51.373 --> 18:55.283
You know what? You got a
lot of growing up to do!

19:02.504 --> 19:03.362
Hey.

19:03.455 --> 19:05.393
Don't you "Hey" me.

19:05.804 --> 19:08.122
My daughter stayed home
from college for you.

19:08.158 --> 19:09.796
She could have had
a bright future.

19:09.837 --> 19:13.796
Sure, she wouldn't be president of a
company or anything 'cause she's a gal,

19:15.217 --> 19:18.328
but she would have been
one hell of a secretary!

19:23.730 --> 19:25.483
Okay, look, Donna,
I know you're upset...

19:25.518 --> 19:28.149
Eric, if you wanna break up
with me, just go ahead and do it.

19:28.184 --> 19:29.522
What? No!

19:30.333 --> 19:32.023
Donna, I'm not
breaking up with you.

19:32.068 --> 19:32.890
Really?

19:33.360 --> 19:37.305
Well, did you consider me at all before
you decided to run away to Africa?

19:37.986 --> 19:39.924
Okay, look, Donna,

19:40.594 --> 19:43.846
the reason I'm
doing this is for us.

19:44.022 --> 19:47.826
Okay? So I can go to college
and get a job, you know,

19:48.496 --> 19:50.233
so I can deserve you.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.852
Don't give me that crap.
You're doing it for you.

19:54.437 --> 19:57.513
Donna, when my dad got sick,
and I had to stay at home,

19:58.770 --> 20:01.213
I thought I'd missed
my only chance.

20:02.904 --> 20:04.125
But this is it.

20:04.395 --> 20:06.703
This is my second chance.

20:06.920 --> 20:11.624
And you're always saying how I gotta get
out of this town, how I gotta start my life.

20:11.773 --> 20:14.614
Donna, I thought if anyone was gonna
support me in this, it was gonna be you.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.171
So good. Go start it.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.749
Look, I really just don't
wanna fight about this.

20:22.878 --> 20:24.322
What do you wanna do?

20:27.332 --> 20:28.342
Movie?

20:30.326 --> 20:31.841
And then what?

20:32.311 --> 20:36.646
Um, I vote the thing we
usually do after a movie.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.673
What's the point of that?

20:41.155 --> 20:43.057
Well, I don't
know. I think that's

20:43.139 --> 20:45.241
really its own reward.

20:48.043 --> 20:49.640
I think you need to leave.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.153
- Donna, I'm not...
- She said get out.

20:53.292 --> 20:55.746
I know, 'cause I was
listening the whole time.

20:59.488 --> 21:00.627
Okay, fine.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.171
You still got me, cupcake.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.625
Thanks, dad.

21:08.153 --> 21:10.819
If it makes you feel any
better, he's gonna be sorry.

21:11.148 --> 21:15.257
I read someplace that in Africa, they
got a bug that burrows in your brain

21:16.315 --> 21:19.039
and shoots out your
eyes like worm bullets.

21:26.514 --> 21:27.758
Okay, Angie,

21:28.052 --> 21:31.434
Kelso feels that you two should
have one last night together,

21:31.469 --> 21:36.152
and he wants it to be special. So
it will take place in this dark room.

21:36.199 --> 21:39.815
And for a minute you may think,
"Hey, this is not Kelso!"

21:40.754 --> 21:42.843
But that's just
the liquor talking.

21:43.547 --> 21:46.812
I forgot to mention you will
need to drink a lot of liquor.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.573
You going to get
the liquor now?

21:52.346 --> 21:53.685
Okay, I'll wait.
