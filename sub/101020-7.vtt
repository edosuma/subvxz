WEBVTT

00:17.058 --> 00:18.852
Damn it, we're still in the den.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.688
That, or the demon realm
looks a lot like home.

00:21.771 --> 00:22.939
Shit, guys, it didn't work.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.857
I can fix it.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.235
I'll get it up and running, I promise.
Just give me a second.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.320
It's not you, Nicole, it's this spell.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.449
Just like the last one,
and the one before that.

00:32.532 --> 00:36.953
Look, the grimoires we've been sneaking
from the reliquary are appetizers.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.914
To access the demon realm,
we need a main-course incantation.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.416
And all of those were in the vault.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.169
So our only chance to save Lilith
was stolen?

00:44.961 --> 00:46.171
It appears so.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.757
Then why aren't we kicking down doors
and tracking it all down?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.467
Because the last time we tried that,

00:50.550 --> 00:53.720
some inbred plant cult almost
turned me into a life-sized Chia Pet.

00:53.803 --> 00:57.265
Yeah, and ever since then, we've been kept
on a short leash by Severa.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.516
Absolutely not.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.770
What? She is the Grand Magus.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.647
Look, we'll get Lilith back, I promise.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.358
You're right. we just have to keep trying.

01:12.113 --> 01:12.989
Later, guys.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.491
Bye, Nicole.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.330
I hate lying to her like that.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.041
Telling her we're responsible
is not going to make it better.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.250
She's right, though.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.585
We should look for that stuff.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.837
No, what we should be doing
is hunting down Foley

01:27.921 --> 01:28.838
and rescuing Midnight.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.174
We're not doing anything
until the Order says so.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.426
We need to show Vera
we can be team players.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.552
Why?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.012
Do you want her to like us?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.098
-I want her to not punish us.
- Hm.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.390
Right, that, too.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.142
I guess that's valid.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.310
-Jack--
-I know.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.728
I know, "heel."

02:03.706 --> 02:06.584
Alyssa, come on, I know you're home.
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

02:09.712 --> 02:10.797
Now you have, so...

02:11.214 --> 02:13.591
Alyssa, look,
I know what you're going through.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.010
All right, getting weaned off
that Promethean mind juice,

02:16.094 --> 02:17.428
it took me a while, too, and...

02:18.304 --> 02:19.639
even Vera had trouble with it.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.724
Except you have wolf powers
to help heal you,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.143
and she's a Grand Magus.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.854
Probably a robot.

02:27.105 --> 02:31.025
I-- I get it.
That Egregore shit is strong and...

02:31.943 --> 02:34.362
without it, you feel like
you're stuck in limbo, but

02:34.946 --> 02:37.282
you're not alone, okay?

02:51.337 --> 02:52.172
Yeah.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.215
I'm, uh...

02:55.300 --> 02:56.759
taking some "me" time.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.472
Uh, well,
maybe your detox plan was too short.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.309
We could talk to Vera
about getting you more juice.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.226
Never again.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.106
What do you want?
Tell me, and I'll get it for you.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.192
My magic fixed?

03:12.275 --> 03:13.109
Alyssa,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.611
you're not broken.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.653
Vera thinks so.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.823
She sidelined me during Rogwan,
and now it's an outright ban.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.620
And not a single disciple has reached out.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.496
Uh...

03:25.580 --> 03:26.414
Hello?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.209
You don't count.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.085
I don't-- I should count the most.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.838
Look, don't take it too personally,
all right?

03:33.922 --> 03:36.883
Between hunting down Foley
and covering for us,

03:36.966 --> 03:38.760
Vera has a lot on her plate.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.054
Did you just defend Vera Stone?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.097
Yeah, I guess I did.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.643
Careful, she may have
messed with your mind again.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.519
Well, she can try.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.105
It's not gonna work this time.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.858
Why? Because there's nothing in there
to work with?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.068
Ha ha.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.444
Because I...

03:57.946 --> 03:59.155
I'm tired of letting...

04:00.156 --> 04:01.866
revenge and anger control my life.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.285
<i>The Tao of Pete.</i>

04:04.661 --> 04:05.745
You know, it's funny.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.747
I think I was afraid to let

04:08.331 --> 04:10.792
all that stuff go 'cause I'm afraid
to let him go.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.713
What brought us together
was getting back at Coventry.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.260
What if that's all we had?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.224
It isn't.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.435
But it's good to hear you talk
about what you want to let go.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.605
Gives me hope.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.821
We're being friends here,
is that what's happening?

04:41.864 --> 04:42.824
I don't know.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.493
A real friend would clean my apartment.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.705
Yeah, hold that thought.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.210
Look, I gotta go,

04:54.294 --> 04:55.378
but if you need...

04:56.379 --> 04:57.255
anything...

04:58.715 --> 05:00.300
Anything, I'm here for you.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.343
You got it?

05:03.928 --> 05:04.762
Yeah.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.660
This doesn't make any sense.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.913
This isn't an alliance,
it's an amnesty for theft.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.875
It's not an amnesty,
it's terms of surrender.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.418
We can't sign this.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.086
I think you're overreacting.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.838
I think you're protecting your girlfriend.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.548
We're not... Uh, we...

05:40.631 --> 05:42.175
How dare you?

05:42.258 --> 05:43.551
-Wha--

05:43.634 --> 05:45.053
Randall, it's not that bad.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.513
There's a code of conduct,

05:48.097 --> 05:49.515
a pledge of fealty,

05:49.974 --> 05:51.100
a dress code?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.560
You could use one.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.357
We can't even call ourselves
the Knights of Saint Christopher.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.526
Our hide lockers stay at the temple?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.236
Oh, no, no, no, no!

06:02.445 --> 06:04.072
Some of these items
are a little extreme...

06:05.365 --> 06:06.324
Grand Magus.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.534
Nevertheless...

06:09.494 --> 06:11.204
-these are...

06:11.287 --> 06:12.288
...the terms.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.586
Look, Grand Magus,

06:18.669 --> 06:20.630
it's not that we don't appreciate
the offer, but--

06:20.713 --> 06:21.756
We don't.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.427
We were expecting an alliance
like the ones you offered the Prometheans.

06:26.511 --> 06:31.933
Oh, well, the Sons of Prometheus
are a separate organization.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.477
You are not.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.729
Never have been.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.315
Before facing Rogwan,

06:39.399 --> 06:44.946
you and Ms. Bathory said an oath
that sounded familiar.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.739
Right there.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.575
"I give my life to the cause..."

06:49.659 --> 06:53.663
"...of defending
the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose..."

06:53.746 --> 06:56.666
-"From threats both within and without."

06:57.250 --> 06:59.502
Your true oath.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.339
Time to come home.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.852
The Knights of the Blue Rose.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.479
Guardians of the Vade Maecum.
Can you believe this?

07:19.647 --> 07:22.775
Cassie told me everything I had to know
was in those journals.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.277
And?

07:24.902 --> 07:25.945
I got distracted.

07:26.654 --> 07:31.325
Dudes, if we do this, we are killing
the Knights of Saint Christopher.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.743
Think of Lilith.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.330
The Order can help us track down
that library and find the right spell.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.082
Or it's a trick.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.461
It was all in that book.
The Knights originally served the Order.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.879
Of course you'd believe her.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.131
I believe her.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.843
Dude, for real?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.971
Look, it's just a feeling
I'm getting from Silverback.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.764
Don't you get feelings from Greybeard?

07:53.848 --> 07:54.891
Just hunger.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.392
It's probably a tapeworm.

07:56.976 --> 07:57.894
Can I see a menu?

07:59.729 --> 08:02.773
If she's telling the truth, we need
to honor our history, and that oath.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.818
Oh, God, this is your argument
about user agreements all over again.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.362
-I can't believe you don't read those.
-I can't believe you do.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.073
It's a binding contract, like our pledge.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.825
We have to sign. She's got us.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.868
And if we don't?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.245
What's she gonna do, kill us?

08:16.329 --> 08:19.040
She's too smart to kill us,
not while Praxis has our hide lockers.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.917
It'd be like giving your enemy
a loaded gun.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.544
No, she'll probably just imprison us.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.630
Okay, you don't have to sound
so impressed.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.298
-It's sound tactical strategy.
-Guys!

08:27.381 --> 08:29.634
Fighting with each other
is not going to help us.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.802
Look, I get it.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.888
You don't like the Order.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.225
But Vera is not Edward, all right?
She's not a monster.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.809
She could've killed me at the Commons.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.938
We gave her every reason to
when we robbed her,  but she didn't.

08:43.439 --> 08:44.357
So you trust her?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.692
I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.

08:51.948 --> 08:52.782
I vote no.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.743
This feels too much like a surrender.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.495
Knights don't surrender.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.915
Our problems are too big to handle
on our own.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.708
Our needs are tied to the Order's.

09:03.125 --> 09:03.960
I'm a yes.

09:04.043 --> 09:04.877
Okay.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.880
So that's one yea and one nay.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.594
Maybe.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.804
I invoke privilege.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.600
What is privilege?

09:20.226 --> 09:21.477
Boom! I win!

09:22.270 --> 09:24.814
Yeah, congratulations.

09:24.981 --> 09:25.856
Now you choose.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.400
I what?

09:28.818 --> 09:30.152
No, I don't want to decide.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.487
Winner always decides.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.197
What did you think we were playing for?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.449
Not-- No, that's way too much pressure.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.867
No kidding.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.869
That's why you made me play, huh?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.913
-Newest knight, freshest eyes.
-Yeah.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.790
That, and I always beat him.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.584
-Not always.
-Most of the time.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.086
Beer pong's the reason you're still alive.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.171
You decided my fate
over a game of beer pong?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.841
We usually do best two out of three.

09:51.924 --> 09:52.967
Quit stalling.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.185
A choice I don't make will be made for me.

10:04.979 --> 10:05.938
What was that?

10:06.772 --> 10:08.733
Something Vera once told me.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.484
No.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.531
Before, I thought joining the Order
would solve all of my problems,

10:15.615 --> 10:16.866
and then I found out

10:17.491 --> 10:20.119
the cause of all of my problems
was in charge of the Order,

10:20.202 --> 10:21.787
and so everything went to shit.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.997
Wow.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.376
You really need to work
on your pep talks there, coach.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.462
-No.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.590
My point is, before I joined,
I thought the Order was good.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.967
Remember with Rogwan?
They wanted to stop him.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.012
Yeah, after they released him.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.764
That wasn't the Order, though.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.809
That was some idiot that was doing it
for his or her benefit,

10:43.893 --> 10:45.770
like Edward with the Vade Maecum.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.731
All right? Maybe...
the Order isn't the problem,

10:48.814 --> 10:49.982
but the people in charge.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.237
So if we make it our responsibility
to keep them in line...

10:55.321 --> 10:58.449
"To protect it from threats,
both within and without."

10:59.909 --> 11:03.371
So, we're magic internal affairs cops?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.915
Randall, we can turn the Order

11:05.998 --> 11:09.293
into a magic society that works
for the benefit of everyone,

11:09.377 --> 11:10.753
not just the members.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.759
The only way to go forward is to sign.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.182
So that's it.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.893
It's the end of the Knights
as we know them.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.021
It's not the end, it's just a change.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.064
Like puberty.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.274
Don't worry.
You'll know what it's like someday.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.526
Ha ha ha.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.363
Well, you have to have the talk
with Lilith when she's back.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.368
So it's settled.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.296
So?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.298
How do we acknowledge this

11:56.382 --> 11:58.384
momentous, life-altering event?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.014
-I got a two-for-one pizza promo.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.229
-Hi, Mike.
-Good morning, Amy.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.122
Alyssa.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.331
I need to talk to you...

12:31.417 --> 12:32.501
about the Egregore.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.384
Xavier made it clear to your Magus.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.303
You'll only be getting enough
to wean you off.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.180
We need the rest
to rebuild the organization,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.724
especially since the Order took everything
that Praxis didn't.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.602
It's not that. After you tricked me
into drinking the juice...

12:49.685 --> 12:52.354
-I wouldn't say I tricked you.
-...I could hear you talking to Essie.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.024
You said that I couldn't fully connect
to the Egregore.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.066
Why not?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.152
It's not an uncommon experience
for outsiders.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.781
Pre-existing bonds can interfere
with the magic that forms our Egregore.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.948
Pre-existing, like...

13:03.657 --> 13:05.326
Like how you feel about a person?

13:05.409 --> 13:06.994
Like how you feel about Jack?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.580
-Yes.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.503
Can you eliminate the interference?

13:16.045 --> 13:18.005
We have an elixir
that can sever those bonds.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.758
Are you asking to rejoin the Egregore?

13:21.926 --> 13:25.054
I think that the bond blocking
my connection to the Egregore

13:25.137 --> 13:26.680
is also blocking my magic.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.058
Right. Of course.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.560
I mean, I suppose it's possible.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.816
Look, magic is the only thing
that makes sense to me.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.151
I'm lost without it.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.530
If this bond is crippling my magic,
then...

13:44.907 --> 13:46.116
I have to break it.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.203
I need you to make me that elixir.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.958
What do I get in exchange?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.044
I won't tell Vera you're the reason

13:57.127 --> 14:00.089
why marijuana consumption on campus
has jumped 1,000%.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.677
I'll need a piece of Jack
to brew the elixir.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.679
Like hair?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.180
Or a finger.

14:09.932 --> 14:10.808
Hair it is.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.686
Are you sure you want to do this?

14:14.228 --> 14:15.855
We felt the emotions you shared.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.524
Come on, those lips?

14:19.733 --> 14:21.944
They're not that great.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.155
If he is the blockage,

14:25.656 --> 14:26.949
this spell will completely sever

14:27.032 --> 14:29.368
all emotional connections
you have for Jack Morton,

14:29.827 --> 14:30.661
good or bad.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.163
Are you sure this is what you want?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.292
I won't be held back anymore.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.929
- <i>Inveniatur Cameron Foley.</i>

14:51.682 --> 14:53.684
It's not working.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.477
No shit.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.648
Your disciples can't perform
a simple tracking spell?

15:00.274 --> 15:01.358
It's not that simple

15:01.442 --> 15:03.861
when the person you're hunting
knows how to cover their tracks.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.696
So whatever you want, can it wait?

15:05.779 --> 15:06.822
I'm a little busy.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.366
No, Vera.<i> </i>It can't wait.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.328
Continue working, please.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.958
You have got to be kidding me.

15:19.126 --> 15:19.960
Now?

15:23.839 --> 15:24.882
God damn it, Kepler.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.176
I, Elizabeth Kepler, head of...

15:27.259 --> 15:30.137
I am this close to finding Foley
and everything he took from us.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.057
...sacred scrolls of An Nem Tep,
do hereby assigned myself the ranking...

15:33.140 --> 15:35.684
-Now is not the time for this.
-...and assign myself

15:35.768 --> 15:38.020
the solemn duty to undertake<i> Invocare.</i>

15:38.103 --> 15:40.272
You are out of your mind.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.192
You endangered us all
when you drank that mind juice,

15:43.275 --> 15:44.693
and it's not the first time

15:44.777 --> 15:46.946
you've put your own interests
ahead of this organization.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.573
The Order needs a leader with vision.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.784
Who's that gonna be, Kepler? You?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.702
I am merely a conduit

15:54.411 --> 15:56.330
for the will of the Order.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.430
<i>They say college is where</i>
<i>you meet your true friends.</i>

16:13.514 --> 16:16.225
Apparently, it's also where you meet
your best enemies.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.476
Sorry about that.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.269
I'm Jack.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.397
Hi, Jack.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.025
<i>Astounding?</i>

16:29.947 --> 16:30.948
Beautiful.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.493
Cool.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.259
<i>I love you.</i>

17:10.738 --> 17:14.825
I can honestly say
I was not expecting this.

17:15.909 --> 17:16.994
Me, neither.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.623
-Just makes everything that much harder.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.666
Boy trouble?

17:23.709 --> 17:24.585
Boys.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.713
Impressive.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.382
I wanted to get it over with
and get out of here.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.426
- Fine with that.
- Yeah, no kidding.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.429
I guess now I am waiting till tomorrow.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.142
When you know what's right for you,
you just have to push through and do it.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.269
Even if you end up breaking a few hearts.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.731
Including your own.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.360
They teaching life skills
at the sororities now?

17:50.444 --> 17:51.528
Whoa.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.906
Hey, now. The "S" word? Really?

17:53.989 --> 17:56.200
Sorry, I just... assumed.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.285
I'm someone who joins groups?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.370
And clearly...

18:00.454 --> 18:01.997
...you're not.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.919
Well, they're lucky to have you.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.421
Tell them that.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.340
Any time.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.425
Salvador.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.385
Alyssa.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.347
Shall we?

18:23.852 --> 18:24.853
Hey, Alyssa!

18:25.938 --> 18:26.772
Alyssa!

18:27.481 --> 18:28.565
Hey, it's Jack!

18:33.529 --> 18:34.696
Snap and shine!

18:36.031 --> 18:37.157
Whoo!

18:38.075 --> 18:39.243
Oh, I'm so glad you came!

18:39.326 --> 18:40.577
-Oh, hey!
-Yeah.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.703
-Oh!
-All right.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.372
Um...

18:44.289 --> 18:47.376
Okay. Uh, do you want to talk
somewhere quiet?

18:47.459 --> 18:49.503
Of course, yeah.
I wanna show you something. Come on.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.177
I said somewhere quiet.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.096
Hang on. Where is it?

19:00.889 --> 19:01.723
Ta-da!

19:02.558 --> 19:04.351
-Yeah, that's a cup.
-Yes, no.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.521
Not just a cup.
This is <i>the</i> cup that changed everything.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.650
Vera offered us amnesty,
and we're taking it.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.569
We're joining the Order, again!

19:13.652 --> 19:14.820
For real.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.655
Are you out of your mind?

19:17.322 --> 19:20.117
I thought you'd be happy. Come on,
we get to be on the same side now.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.411
I don't want you to change for me.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.413
Alyssa, I would do anything for you. Here.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.581
I will prove it to you.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.041
Jack, wait.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.170
Alyssa, hey! Did you hear the news?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.172
We're joining the Order again.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.799
-About that--
-We're gonna be one big happy family.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.718
New families are the best.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.220
Do I have to call Vera "Mom"?
'Cause I will!

19:40.304 --> 19:41.638
Fun!

19:48.520 --> 19:49.855
Mm.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.815
Hey, are you looking for Jack?

19:53.108 --> 19:54.693
-Are you guys crazy?

19:55.110 --> 19:56.069
So you heard.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.239
Turns out, we used to be
the Knights of the Blue Rose,

19:59.323 --> 20:03.577
tasked with protecting the Order
from threats, both inside and out.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.830
So, if you can't fight 'em, police 'em.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.874
But why?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.878
Try this. It's called a Lily-Bell.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.423
Rye, vermouth, sherry,
and a splash of Fernet-Branca.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.263
It's good. Strong.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.765
Like her.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.809
That's why you're doing it.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.313
This might be the only way
to get the Order to help us rescue her.

20:32.856 --> 20:33.941
To hope.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.320
-Mm.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.199
Oh, duty calls.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.916
What are you doing here?

20:53.126 --> 20:54.336
Hello, Gabrielle.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.837
Just wanna talk to Jack.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.547
God, you two are so lame.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.424
You know the whole time
I let him live with me,

20:59.508 --> 21:00.801
he was basically all about you?

21:00.884 --> 21:03.929
He even dreamed about you,
like, all the fricking time. So annoying.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.597
What are you doing here anyway?

21:06.306 --> 21:08.100
I'm basically, like, the fifth Knight.

21:09.893 --> 21:10.852
Good luck with that.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.605
Things get complicated when
you hang out with these guys for too long.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.648
You don't know me,

21:14.731 --> 21:16.566
and I like complicated,

21:16.650 --> 21:19.194
and friends who look past the surface,

21:19.278 --> 21:21.154
and maybe you should be nicer to me.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.364
I don't need more friends.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.533
You don't have any friends!

21:25.909 --> 21:26.785
Oh, my God.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.288
Is that a karaoke machine?

21:30.831 --> 21:31.915
We're singing a duet.

21:32.874 --> 21:33.792
Move!

21:34.209 --> 21:35.085
Randall.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.463
Nicole! Hey!

21:38.964 --> 21:39.798
Um...

21:39.881 --> 21:42.217
Oh, don't worry, everyone's way too drunk.
Watch.

21:42.759 --> 21:43.760
Hey, guys.

21:43.844 --> 21:47.889
I'm part of a secret society
dedicated to fighting evil magic.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.475
-Eh, yeah!

21:50.559 --> 21:52.436
See? See? No one cares.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.605
Okay. I found the spell
that's going to work.

21:56.356 --> 21:57.566
We can do it tonight...

21:57.649 --> 21:59.067
or tomorrow morning.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.659
This spell only retrieves
non-living things.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.579
Lilith is most definitely alive.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.956
How did I miss that?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.168
-I'm just...

22:16.251 --> 22:17.127
It's okay.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.045
You're wiped.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.047
You haven't stopped since she disappeared.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.090
I've been through every book
in Vera's reliquary.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.134
That was literally our last chance.

22:24.217 --> 22:26.261
If I ever get my hands
on whoever robbed us...

22:26.928 --> 22:30.640
That... would... be... us.

22:30.724 --> 22:34.019
We robbed the vault
so we could leave the Order,

22:34.102 --> 22:37.522
but then Praxis robbed us,
so really, it's their fault.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.483
This whole time, I've been blaming myself.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.610
No one is laying any blame on you.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.737
-I was!
-This is totally on us.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.489
So what happened to her
is her fault, then?

22:45.572 --> 22:47.824
And I'm the idiot who thought
she was in love with a hero.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.493
She wasn't trying to save me,

22:49.576 --> 22:51.411
she was trying to cover her own ass.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.205
This all came out wrong.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.708
We want to rescue her more than anyone,

22:56.792 --> 22:58.377
and we will, believe me.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.836
No.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.464
No, I can't screw up again.
Not like this. I...

23:03.131 --> 23:03.965
I can't.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.469
Okay, I feel like we're just talking
about two different things here.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.347
Nicole!

23:34.579 --> 23:36.540
-Hello? Nope.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.624
Oh-oh.

23:39.000 --> 23:39.960
Oh-oh.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.212

-You're awake.
-Yeah.

28:12.857 --> 28:13.775
Um...

28:14.526 --> 28:16.736
I had a bad dream.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.405
Yeah?

28:19.030 --> 28:20.990
Was I wearing a cheerleading outfit?

28:22.117 --> 28:24.119
As a matter fact, you were.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.957
And we lived in a world without magic.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.543
Sounds terrible.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.378
It is.

28:47.016 --> 28:51.062
Uh, we should, um, blow off class
and go get breakfast.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.606
I...

28:54.607 --> 28:55.692
I've got a thing.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.736
I can't. I'm sorry.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.282
Well, last night was amazing.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.828
Yeah, I thought so, too.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.099
Get some sleep.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.560
Okay.

29:57.086 --> 29:57.962
Nice shirt.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.881
Randall's got one just like it.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.510
What the hell?

30:03.593 --> 30:06.888
That's for not dumping me before
you took off with Alyssa last night.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.849
I'm your fake girlfriend.
I deserve more respect.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.184
We were never really together.

30:15.939 --> 30:16.773
So?

30:17.649 --> 30:18.650
You and Randall?

30:20.360 --> 30:21.736
You and I are so broken up.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.322
Why do we have to keep going
to this stupid class?

30:24.405 --> 30:25.615
Foley's long gone.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.409
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,
but I need the credits to graduate.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.037
It's from Kepler.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.501
Why didn't I get it?

30:37.210 --> 30:39.879
Probably because
the world doesn't revolve around you.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.303
That's far enough.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.224
Kepler gave strict orders
not to let you through.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.809
Why is Kepler giving orders?

30:53.309 --> 30:54.310
I'm not telling you.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.520
You can tell me.

31:00.149 --> 31:01.067
There's been an attack.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.654
Get over it.
He was going to find out anyway.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.531
An attack on us?

31:07.031 --> 31:08.199
There is no "us."

31:08.283 --> 31:09.158
There's the Order,

31:09.576 --> 31:11.119
and there's you assholes.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.757
-I need to talk to Kepler.
-You can try.

31:35.810 --> 31:36.853
Mr. Morton.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.314
If I didn't know any better,

31:39.397 --> 31:41.941
I'd say you were pleased
to see me still alive.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.735
Oh, trust me, it's purely selfish.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.863
Your amnesty. Of course.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.907
You got a little... thing.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.329
-What happened?

31:55.455 --> 31:59.334
Praxis launched attacks
against several temples.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.920
Disciples across the country are dead.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.380
Disciples like you, Mr. Morton.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.716
If you're okay,
then why is Kepler running the show?

32:07.216 --> 32:09.302
Because Kepler triggered <i>Invocare.</i>

32:10.428 --> 32:11.346
We're at war.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.765
She's trying to elect a new Grand Magus.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.391
You're Grand Magus.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.726
Not anymore.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.479
Perhaps never again.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.733
I dismissed Foley as a fringe radical,

32:23.816 --> 32:26.361
and I let Praxis manifest under my nose.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.739
I underestimated this entire threat,

32:29.822 --> 32:31.699
and now we're both endangered.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.035
We signed your amnesty.

32:34.118 --> 32:38.456
Do you honestly expect the next
Grand Magus to honor that agreement?

32:38.539 --> 32:40.333
Good point.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.710
Okay, you focus on winning this election,

32:42.794 --> 32:45.046
and we'll find Foley.
He's just one werewolf against three.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.799
Do you have something against
devising an actual plan?

32:48.341 --> 32:49.634
I like to improvise.

32:53.805 --> 32:54.722
Magus.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.393
Have you seen or heard
from Hamish this morning?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.480
Why would you ask me that?

33:04.315 --> 33:05.858
I'm just grasping at straws.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.571
I'm certain he's fine.

33:15.660 --> 33:16.786
Now add the hair.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.342
Now what?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.678
Well, it is a tea.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.152
How do you feel?

33:50.319 --> 33:52.196
Like I just drank out of an old shoe.

33:52.739 --> 33:53.781
About Jack Morton.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.582
Damn it. I still care about him.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.167
Damn it.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.129
The potion can only sever the magic block.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.006
-Jack Morton isn't the cause.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.716
It's something else.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.971
But there is no one else. I mean...

34:17.555 --> 34:18.973
Kyle was a mistake.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.976
Shelley was just a fling.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.896
I don't speak to my family, but...

34:26.481 --> 34:30.109
I admired Edward Coventry
as a mentor, but...

34:37.575 --> 34:38.409
Oh, no.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.915
You were supposed to take care of them.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.125
There were too many innocent civilians.

34:46.209 --> 34:48.836
So you take one of the stupid Knights
as a hostage?

34:49.087 --> 34:50.088
Relax.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.049
The chains prevent any transformation,

34:53.132 --> 34:56.511
and that sleep spell lasts for hours.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.889
And he's here because
you couldn't do your job.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.766
No one could have done that job.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.684
You couldn't do that job.
She's unkillable.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.856
You told me you could manage Belgrave,
that you could establish a cell.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.026
Instead, you recruited incompetents
and psychotics.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.821
Tell me why I am keeping you alive.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.824
Because I'll do anything
for the cause, anything. I swear.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.493
That's right.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.579
You will.

35:42.431 --> 35:43.391
Found this...

35:44.016 --> 35:45.184
tossed into the bushes.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.770
Hamish wolfed out.

35:55.778 --> 35:56.654
Look familiar?

35:56.737 --> 35:58.030
Yeah, another killer stick girl.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.699
They came for him last night.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.410
They came for us.

36:08.082 --> 36:11.002
Look, I don't care how big Praxis is.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.211
They hurt him.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.546
Your friend's alive.

36:14.046 --> 36:16.007
At least, he was the last time I saw him.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.634
I-- I know you're angry.

36:18.718 --> 36:22.221
"Angry" doesn't even begin
to describe what I am.

36:22.597 --> 36:23.472
Start talking.

36:24.390 --> 36:25.224
Now.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.477
Foley sent me here last night to kill you.

36:28.853 --> 36:29.812
Interesting start.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.189
But I didn't,

36:31.272 --> 36:32.648
because last night,

36:32.732 --> 36:35.735
I saw the world that Foley sold us on
right here.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.863
The Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose
and the Knights of Saint Christopher.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.573
No one was fighting.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.408
A world of peace.

36:42.491 --> 36:43.492
A world of magic.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.537
When he found out that
I didn't complete the mission,

36:46.621 --> 36:48.164
he threatened to kill me

36:48.789 --> 36:50.541
unless I took your friend.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.461
Okay, get to the part where
we start caring if you live or die.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.964
Foley changed after he robbed everyone.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.507
He's a werewolf, too,

36:58.591 --> 37:00.927
but he's obsessed with power.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.762
I didn't sign up for murder.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.388
Please.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.015
You have to help us.

37:06.098 --> 37:08.476
I can show you where he is,
and you can rescue your friend.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.810
Yeah, walk right into your trap.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.313
I took a huge risk even coming here.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.814
It's not a trap.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.483
I promise.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.525
Oh, great.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.277
She promises, Jack.

37:19.654 --> 37:20.738
What's in it for you?

37:21.113 --> 37:22.156
You leave me alone.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.243
Let me try to convince the others
to bring Praxis back to its roots.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.412
It's still a good idea, and...

37:29.038 --> 37:30.831
last night I saw what it could be.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.458
We'll check it out.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.044
And you'll stay right here.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.671
What? No.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.715
What if you fail?
What if he finds me here and he--

37:39.799 --> 37:41.968
It's not up for debate.
Tell us where he is.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.763
Okay. Okay. Uh...

37:45.846 --> 37:49.350
Take Highway 8 out of Norwich,
then get off at exit 20.

37:49.892 --> 37:52.061
Take the third left,
head in for two miles.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.063
You'll find an old station house there.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.234
Okay.  Upstairs, now.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.209
Mm.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.420
Mm.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.166
Hey, Professor!

39:00.963 --> 39:03.674
When you land,
you'll be coming straight to the temple.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.177
Kepler wants to start
proceedings immediately.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.929
You'll have to stall her
for as long as you can.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.726
Thank you, Ian. I won't forget this.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.977
Call me when you land.

39:15.728 --> 39:16.771
Miss Drake.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.523
You and your broken magic
aren't supposed to be in this temple.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.026
Yeah, that's actually why I'm here,
Grand Magus.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.571
Orbin told me that something was
blocking my access to the Egregore,

39:26.280 --> 39:27.656
some kind of magic bond.

39:27.740 --> 39:30.576
Then I realized it may be
the same thing affecting my magic.

39:30.659 --> 39:32.203
Mm-hmm. I'm very busy.

39:32.286 --> 39:36.374
At first, I thought Jack was the reason,
but I was wrong,

39:36.457 --> 39:40.336
and there's only one other thing
that I think it could be.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.756
What if the Vade Maecum Infernal survived?

39:49.220 --> 39:50.137
Go on.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.475
Well, I was Edward's witness, and...

39:55.518 --> 39:57.561
if even just a piece of it survived,

39:58.312 --> 39:59.980
I could still be tied to it.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.401
Well, that is impossible.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.195
The Nephilim's tears obliterated it.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.614
I swept the ashes away myself.

40:13.077 --> 40:13.911
Yes.

40:14.995 --> 40:15.955
Yes, of course.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.166
Take my word for it, Miss Drake.

40:20.459 --> 40:23.129
Regardless of the outcome of <i>Invocare,</i>

40:23.212 --> 40:26.382
I will help you get to the bottom
of whatever is

40:26.465 --> 40:28.551
truly breaking your magic.

40:33.013 --> 40:35.099
Thank you, Grand Magus.

40:44.024 --> 40:44.859
You all right?

40:46.902 --> 40:47.736
No.

40:48.028 --> 40:48.946
I'm not.

40:50.739 --> 40:51.866
Could have been killed.

40:52.825 --> 40:53.742
Nearly was.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.204
I sensed someone coming up on me, but I...

40:57.997 --> 40:59.373
basically ignored it because...

41:00.416 --> 41:02.126
who could hurt me? I'm a werewolf.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.462
It's okay. You're safe now.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.881
- I'm an idiot.
-No, you're not.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.633
I've already been stabbed once.
I still thought I couldn't be hurt.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.514
Well, he won't tell me where the stuff is,

41:15.598 --> 41:18.309
but he did give me a great recipe
for Rice Krispies squares.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.561
-My turn.
-Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

41:20.644 --> 41:21.604
We need him alive.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.689
Okay? I will talk to him.

41:31.614 --> 41:35.493
Look, tell us where you stashed the stuff,
and we'll make sure Vera goes easy on you.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.330
You want me to talk, you're gonna
have to offer more than merciful death.

41:39.914 --> 41:43.292
You signed your own death warrant
when you went up against the Order.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.794
You think you have the right to do that?

41:45.878 --> 41:47.254
It doesn't matter what I think.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.298
And that's your problem, Jack.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.634
You're smart, but you're dumb.

41:51.717 --> 41:54.720
You're really not the person that should
be lecturing me about this situation.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.514
I'm not talking about the ethics.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.140
I'm talking about your morals.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.141
It's the same thing.

41:59.225 --> 42:02.019
If I actually get through to you
about anything, let it be this:

42:02.102 --> 42:04.230
Ethics and morals are not the same thing.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.981
Ethics are the rules to the game,

42:06.065 --> 42:07.983
and your morals dictate
whether you follow them,

42:08.067 --> 42:09.443
like this situation right now.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.197
You're looking at this as a binary option
because you're refusing to see yourself

42:13.280 --> 42:14.782
as an agent of change, but...

42:15.824 --> 42:18.327
you could release me. Hell...

42:18.410 --> 42:19.453
...you could join me.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.372
Praxis is finished.

42:22.122 --> 42:22.957
Okay?

42:23.207 --> 42:25.918
Your fate was sealed
the minute Salvador gave you up.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.296
What else did she tell you?

42:29.380 --> 42:32.174
That you're a murderer,
not a revolutionary.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.511
Ouch. Harsh.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.179
And that with you gone,

42:37.721 --> 42:41.183
she thinks she can restore Praxis
to its peaceful beginnings.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.646
You actually think
the Order will let her do that?

42:46.522 --> 42:47.481
It's a shame, Jack.

42:49.858 --> 42:53.362
If I had come to Belgrave earlier,
if we'd met sooner...

42:54.405 --> 42:57.992
you and I could have been allies,
and everything would have been different.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.077
I sincerely doubt that.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.329
You are not one of them
and you never will be.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.998
In their eyes, you'll always be a townie.

43:04.415 --> 43:08.711
And I know, deep down, you appreciate me
trying to level this playing field.

43:08.794 --> 43:11.463
Otherwise, you would have
brought me in hours ago.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.466
We just want our stuff back.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.135
Let me go and it's yours.

43:17.761 --> 43:18.846
You know what I'm craving?

43:18.929 --> 43:21.557
-Rice Krispies squares?
-Rice Krispies squares.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.434
Sometimes I wonder
how we're all still alive.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.019
Yeah. Me, too.

43:25.519 --> 43:26.562
We're going.

43:26.645 --> 43:27.813
Give me one more shot at him.

43:27.896 --> 43:29.732
No, we need to take him to Vera, okay?

43:29.815 --> 43:32.359
We're obviously terrible
at this enhanced interrogation.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.111
FYI, that is a good thing.

43:34.194 --> 43:37.114
We need her, and she needs Foley
if she's gonna remain Grand Magus.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.282
Maybe she shouldn't.

43:38.365 --> 43:40.326
Do you really wanna take that risk?
'Cause I don't.

43:40.409 --> 43:41.619
We can handle this on our own.

43:41.702 --> 43:42.828
Maybe we shouldn't have to.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.913
Well, if you want my opinion--<i> </i>

43:50.002 --> 43:53.130
Can't wait for the vote to be over
so things go back to normal.

43:53.422 --> 43:55.716
There's no such thing as normal
around here.

43:56.091 --> 43:57.885
They said USC was hit the worst.

43:57.968 --> 43:58.844
I'm sorry, Angus.

43:59.261 --> 44:01.764
The way those Adeptii are talking,
it doesn't seem like they think

44:01.847 --> 44:03.807
Vera will make a very strong war Magus.

44:04.099 --> 44:06.518
Once she's out, so are the wolves.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.979
You didn't meet our last Grand Magus.

44:09.396 --> 44:11.607
If it weren't for the wolves,
we'd be dead right now.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.400
Of course you'd say that.

44:13.817 --> 44:15.527
Yeah, wolf lover.

44:15.611 --> 44:16.445
Excuse you?

44:16.904 --> 44:19.239
If anyone's a mangy wolf lover, it's you.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.325
That was before I knew
the truth about them.

44:26.830 --> 44:27.831
Is everyone okay?

44:31.043 --> 44:32.127
Did we miss anything?

44:32.753 --> 44:33.629
Just in time.

44:41.553 --> 44:43.013
To the Knights of Saint Christopher.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.474
-AKA the Knights of the Blue Rose.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.017
Still not used to it.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.561
-Gotta go.

44:52.147 --> 44:53.148
I'm gonna take off, too.

44:53.232 --> 44:56.193
W-- Wait, come on. At least stay
and finish your drink with me.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.070
I'm not thirsty.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.370
Oh, my God, we have a hostage.

45:06.453 --> 45:07.996
Can I get two burgers to go?

45:13.001 --> 45:16.088
We caught Foley and we got him to Vera
in time for <i>Invocare.</i>

45:16.171 --> 45:17.840
I know why my magic is crippled.

45:17.923 --> 45:20.759
Vera lied about the Vade Maecum.
She didn't destroy it.

45:21.468 --> 45:23.554
That's impossible. We saw it burn to ash.

45:23.637 --> 45:24.471
Exactly.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.057
She must've switched out
the Nephilim's tears for something else.

45:27.182 --> 45:29.184
Real Nephilim's tears
would've obliterated that book.

45:29.268 --> 45:31.395
There should've been nothing left,
not even ash.

45:32.604 --> 45:33.480
Holy shit.

45:35.482 --> 45:36.900
She must have had her reasons, then.

45:37.401 --> 45:38.902
Maybe the book did something to her.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.448
How could you say that?

45:43.323 --> 45:45.325
I'm broken because of that book.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.077
You almost died because of it.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.704
Yeah, I remember. I was there.

45:48.787 --> 45:49.663
And you're not angry?

45:49.747 --> 45:53.292
Of course I'm angry, but I'm trying
to let go of anger and revenge, remember?

45:53.375 --> 45:55.377
Yeah, well, maybe I'm not. Maybe I...

45:58.005 --> 45:59.381
You said you would do anything.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.467
Okay.

46:02.092 --> 46:03.761
Let's go talk to her, figure this out.

46:05.804 --> 46:07.055
You really believe that?

46:08.348 --> 46:09.391
I do.

46:10.392 --> 46:11.268
I have to.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.401
We're never going to be on the same side.

46:27.117 --> 46:29.244
Well, you were right about Foley.

46:29.328 --> 46:30.162
Hope you're...

46:31.121 --> 46:31.955
hungry.

46:40.005 --> 46:40.923
Holy shit.

46:43.717 --> 46:45.010
She's a werewolf.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.098
Professor Foley.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.643
I regret to inform you,

46:52.726 --> 46:55.938
Belgrave University will not
be renewing your contract.

46:56.021 --> 46:56.855
What?

46:59.107 --> 47:00.859
Is this 'cause I failed you last term?

47:01.276 --> 47:03.111
Utter an incantation and you die.

47:03.779 --> 47:04.822
Even abracadabra?

47:09.993 --> 47:11.954
Tell me where my magic is.

47:12.037 --> 47:15.249
Why is it that abracadabra
is such a bullshit incantation,

47:15.332 --> 47:19.044
but I could utter some ancient Latin
and level this room?

47:19.127 --> 47:21.088
My magic, where is it?

47:21.171 --> 47:24.550
We think the word dictates the magic.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.136
But how does magic even know...

47:29.930 --> 47:32.266
Even know what these words mean?

47:33.559 --> 47:34.685
You know what I think?

47:34.810 --> 47:37.145
I think we can control magic with our mind

47:37.229 --> 47:40.315
and these words just help us visualize
what we wanna have happen.

47:41.817 --> 47:45.028
I bet I could make any word a magic word

47:45.112 --> 47:48.156
as long as I concentrate
on what I want the magic to do.

47:50.158 --> 47:51.910
And pay for it to...

47:53.537 --> 47:55.581
And, oh, boy, I'm paying for it now.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.668
God, this hurts so much.

48:00.502 --> 48:02.504
I let Salvador down. Please...

48:04.756 --> 48:06.592
...could I get a hug?
