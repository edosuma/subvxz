00:01.835 --> 00:02.752
- Hey, Gabby.

00:02.836 --> 00:03.961
- Can't talk, I'm baking.

00:06.297 --> 00:07.924
- Um, I'm not an expert.

00:08.007 --> 00:12.220
But on the cooking shows,
that stuff goes in a bowl.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.430

00:13.513 --> 00:14.764
Where do the eggs go?

Mm?

00:18.518 --> 00:19.811
- I'm not an expert,

00:19.894 --> 00:23.189
but on the addiction shows
they call this a cry for help.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.444
Are you upset because your mom
is moving back to America?

00:27.527 --> 00:28.737
Are you gonna
have to go live with her?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.280
- No, she gave us a choice.

Now we're just going to visit
her in Florida whenever we want.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.326
I'm actually
pretty happy about it.

00:39.914 --> 00:40.790
- Okay.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.418
Then why are we "baking"?

00:43.501 --> 00:45.795
- Remember how I applied
for college a year early?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.756
- Remember how I cried
and begged you not to?

00:47.839 --> 00:48.631
- Remember how I said,

00:48.715 --> 00:51.217
"Suck it up,
I probably won't get in?"

00:51.301 --> 00:52.802
Well, I got in.

00:52.886 --> 00:53.928

00:54.012 --> 00:55.638

00:58.057 --> 00:59.142

00:59.225 --> 01:00.477
- Here's the thing.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.312
I knew Dad and Steph wouldn't
even want me to apply.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.897
So I did it
without telling them.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.355
And now I'm gonna be awful,

01:05.440 --> 01:09.527
so it'll be easier for them
to let me go.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.848
- Not that I'm complaining,

19:42.931 --> 19:45.767
but, uh, why do you think
they really stayed?

19:45.851 --> 19:48.186
- Uh, don't pull threads,
Charlie, they're staying.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.356
But if all of this chaos
is hanging around,

19:51.440 --> 19:51.815
I can't have a baby.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.944
- O-o-oh, yes!

19:56.028 --> 19:57.279
- Now!

19:57.362 --> 19:59.197
I can't have a baby now.

19:59.281 --> 20:04.119
How 'bout we revisit the subject
next year?

20:04.202 --> 20:05.787
- [chuckles] Fair enough.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.123
To one more year?

20:08.206 --> 20:09.458
- To one more year.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.667
[laughing]

20:10.751 --> 20:16.089
- Hey, wait a minute!

20:16.173 --> 20:17.507
You can't be drinking that!

20:17.591 --> 20:21.053
- Oh!

20:21.136 --> 20:22.012
Neither can you.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.889
You are driving
my kids for ice cream.

20:23.972 --> 20:28.018
- The tall one can drive.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.853

20:32.064 --> 20:35.359
