00:10.760 --> 00:13.230
<i>Was it sunny that day?</i>

00:13.550 --> 00:15.050
<i>Was it raining?</i>

00:20.600 --> 00:24.810
<i>My memory is as
fuzzy as the weather.</i>

00:57.800 --> 00:59.260
What? But...

01:19.450 --> 01:23.040
<i>But in that moment... </i>

01:26.620 --> 01:29.170
<i>my heart was filled with blue sky.</i>

01:36.260 --> 01:43.270
<i>[ The Blue Skies at Your Feet ]</i>

02:32.900 --> 02:36.150
Good morning.
You're finally up.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.450
Curry?

02:42.660 --> 02:45.240
Oh, it's recyclable trash day.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.200
Miyu, can you take it out?

02:47.290 --> 02:48.910
What? No way.

02:49.410 --> 02:52.420
Come on, help me out a little.

02:53.850 --> 02:55.380
<i>Especially in the Kanto region,</i>

02:55.380 --> 02:59.610
<i>there is a possibility of strong
rain with localized thunderstorms...</i>

02:59.730 --> 03:01.230
Rain again?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.480
Hurry up and eat it.
Because it won't clean itself up.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.810
Bread would've been better.

03:07.810 --> 03:10.690
It would be a waste. So eat it.

03:12.350 --> 03:16.610
<i>Later in the evening, as cold air
moves south, it will get even colder.</i>

03:16.610 --> 03:18.690
- You're not gonna eat it?
- I don't want it

03:19.570 --> 03:20.640
Hey.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.160
Oh... Miyu!

03:26.400 --> 03:28.290
Geez...

03:30.210 --> 03:32.670
<i>Why won't it keep
together on rainy days?</i>

03:35.040 --> 03:36.200
Miyu.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.840
Your umbrella. Okay.

03:39.270 --> 03:40.710
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.140
Thank you. Have a nice day.

03:54.350 --> 03:56.110
Good morning.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.940
Good morning. Thank you.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.530
Have a nice day.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.820
Whoa, are you okay?

04:06.910 --> 04:08.970
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.210
It's so embarrassing! Stop it!

04:15.080 --> 04:19.330
<i>Curry in the morning, and weather
forecast says it will rain all the time.</i>

04:19.330 --> 04:21.010
I'm so unlucky.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.840
Wow, so cold!

04:29.210 --> 04:30.270
Good morning.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.430
Good morning, Sakiko.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.730
Miyu.

04:34.850 --> 04:35.760
Miyu?

04:36.350 --> 04:36.960
Huh?

04:39.150 --> 04:40.320
You okay?

04:41.650 --> 04:43.490
Huh? Why?

04:44.260 --> 04:48.230
Ah... I was wondering
if you had studied for the test.

04:49.370 --> 04:50.370
Test?

04:50.370 --> 04:53.830
Fourth period,
English test, remember?

04:54.330 --> 04:56.000
Do we have one today?

04:58.550 --> 04:59.630
Ah!

05:00.800 --> 05:02.350
I forgot I'm on class duty, too.

05:02.710 --> 05:03.800
Sorry, I'm going ahead.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.430
Okay.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.510
Here, take this.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.510
Later!

05:21.820 --> 05:23.320
Morning, Yuto.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.740
What's with the mask?

05:29.120 --> 05:29.720
Hey.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.120
What's going on with you two?

05:34.250 --> 05:35.720
Huh? With who?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.210
With Shuya.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.080
What's going on...

05:41.040 --> 05:41.920
Nothing.

05:42.420 --> 05:46.550
Nothing... aren't you guys dating?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.510
I don't know.

05:51.290 --> 05:52.890
What are you saying?

05:53.810 --> 05:56.310
You know, don't you? The rumors.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.320
Are you guys even talking at all?
If you won't tell me, I'll just...

06:02.320 --> 06:05.230
You're so nosy.

06:13.160 --> 06:13.950
Miyu.

06:17.790 --> 06:18.920
Thanks.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.130
But I'm totally fine.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.680
<i>I'm the worst...</i>

06:40.940 --> 06:42.900
Go for it! Go, go!

06:46.650 --> 06:47.900
Yeah!

06:47.990 --> 06:51.110
Nice one! Thank you!

06:51.990 --> 06:53.410
Okay, I'll hand them out.

06:53.410 --> 06:54.660
What...

06:54.740 --> 06:55.910
Ah! Ah!

06:56.410 --> 06:59.330
Score less than 50, and you'll stay
after school to turn in your homework.

06:59.410 --> 07:00.290
What!?

07:00.370 --> 07:02.830
Be quiet. Be quiet.

07:02.830 --> 07:05.250
Okay, put your textbooks away.

07:08.330 --> 07:11.090
Write upper case and
lower case letters clearly.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.020
Shuya, you can do it!

07:30.740 --> 07:32.110
What are you daydreaming about?

07:32.730 --> 07:33.800
Sorry...

07:33.990 --> 07:34.740
Here.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.660
Oh, my God.
Sorry, sorry.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.580
Sorry, sorry.
Thank you.

07:44.710 --> 07:48.920
Shuya, you can do it!
One more!

08:14.350 --> 08:17.120
I heard growling during the test.

08:18.730 --> 08:19.580
Thanks for this.

08:19.580 --> 08:20.470
Did you get it?

08:21.370 --> 08:22.710
I got detention.

08:22.790 --> 08:26.630
What?! Today's the first.
You got a date, remember?

08:27.880 --> 08:31.090
Watch the movie
and tell him what I think...

08:31.800 --> 08:35.800
It's not a date,
it's just a movie night.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.350
Miyu...

08:37.430 --> 08:40.810
I mean, what's the point of
only going to the movies on the first

08:40.810 --> 08:43.600
when we can go anytime
with a student discount?

08:45.390 --> 08:48.110
Why don't you just tell him
you want to see him more?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.940
I'm not trying to say that...

08:50.940 --> 08:54.490
Okay, okay.
You're not being honest, Miyu.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.120
Ah... I'm starving.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.830
But it's not that easy
dating someone for two years.

09:02.830 --> 09:03.790
Yes.

09:07.630 --> 09:11.500
I don't know if I'd call it dating...

09:14.770 --> 09:20.300
Miyu, are you still
bothered by the rumors?

09:43.040 --> 09:43.990
Not at all!

09:44.690 --> 09:48.080
Come on, let's eat!
I'm so hungry.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.580
Lunch!

09:56.690 --> 09:57.730
- Look.
- Huh?

09:58.010 --> 10:01.220
Whoa. You didn't put
your lunch box the right way.

10:02.470 --> 10:03.720
But it looks delicious.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.090
Where?

10:05.090 --> 10:08.270
Well, because everything's handmade.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.320
Egg rolls, can I?

10:13.520 --> 10:14.430
It's yours.

10:14.590 --> 10:16.240
- What? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.840
Yay!

10:21.370 --> 10:24.290
Mmm... Delicious!

10:25.880 --> 10:27.850
You're exaggerating.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.040
I'll take one!

10:31.040 --> 10:33.250
- It's really good!
- Right!

10:33.250 --> 10:35.000
It's really good.

10:38.260 --> 10:39.090
He's here.

10:42.530 --> 10:43.670
You should go.

10:44.060 --> 10:44.670
Yeah.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.400
I'll be right back.

11:00.490 --> 11:02.240
<i>W-What?</i>

11:03.700 --> 11:04.740
Miyu...

11:15.290 --> 11:16.760
Your hair's a mess.

11:17.550 --> 11:18.760
You overslept?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.050
It won't keep it together on rainy days.

11:24.050 --> 11:24.800
So?

11:25.410 --> 11:27.520
- What is it?
- "What is it?"...

11:28.020 --> 11:30.270
You can go to the
movie today, right?

11:32.980 --> 11:34.670
I'm free today...

11:35.060 --> 11:39.070
What the heck...
It's like I'm inviting you just to kill time.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.490
See you after school.

11:41.650 --> 11:42.930
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.290
Do you know what today is?

11:57.920 --> 11:58.750
Movie Day?

12:00.460 --> 12:02.800
Yuto's answer was that
it was my Dad's birthday.

12:05.010 --> 12:07.220
I was thinking of
going to the movies.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.570
With who?

12:11.310 --> 12:11.890
Huh?

12:13.520 --> 12:14.310
The movie...

12:16.270 --> 12:17.610
who are you going with?

12:18.770 --> 12:20.360
I haven't decided yet.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.740
Let's go together.
I was thinking of going too.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.320
- What?
- What are you watching?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.780
- Ah...
- Oh, wait.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.040
Let's say it together.

12:31.790 --> 12:37.000
So, if it's the same movie
we want to see... let's watch it.

12:37.670 --> 12:38.590
What do you think?

12:40.930 --> 12:41.760
Yeah.

12:43.130 --> 12:43.980
Okay.

12:45.410 --> 12:46.120
Okay.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.560
Ready?

12:49.190 --> 12:51.110
- One, two...
- One, two...

12:51.280 --> 12:52.530
"I Want to Eat Your Pancreas".

12:54.070 --> 12:55.320
Why?

12:56.280 --> 12:58.050
You two really are a perfect match.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.530
Why don't you two just go out?

13:00.990 --> 13:01.780
What?

13:02.290 --> 13:03.290
Then...

13:04.930 --> 13:06.090
let's go out?

13:08.150 --> 13:09.040
What...

13:15.120 --> 13:17.720
Congrats, man!

13:17.720 --> 13:19.720
- Way to go, Shuya!
- Congrats!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.180
- Let's take a pic.
- I like that!

13:28.230 --> 13:30.370
Say cheese.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.750
Is it really okay?

14:10.940 --> 14:12.190
Okay, thank you.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.320
See you tomorrow.

14:16.780 --> 14:17.860
Are you done?

14:19.930 --> 14:21.200
Are you okay?

14:22.950 --> 14:24.960
You never got detention before, right?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.080
Okay!

14:30.270 --> 14:34.120
Well, don't be a regular like this guy.

14:34.610 --> 14:35.170
Yes.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.590
What the heck..

14:37.880 --> 14:42.430
- Hey, don't write this in katakana.
- No, no, I didn't.

14:50.070 --> 14:52.870
- Be careful on your way home. Don't detour.
- I won't.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.210
- See you.
- Yes. Bye.

15:00.340 --> 15:01.380
Movie...

15:02.170 --> 15:03.120
you're not going?

15:04.590 --> 15:05.550
I'm going.

15:08.180 --> 15:09.550
I really...

15:10.510 --> 15:12.590
don't get you guys.

15:13.850 --> 15:16.520
I don't even know myself.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.650
- See ya.
- Okay.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.490
Oh, sorry. I'll go on ahead.

15:35.490 --> 15:37.670
- Okay, bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow. Take care.

15:38.290 --> 15:39.030
Miyu!

15:43.550 --> 15:44.460
Hey.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.050
Let's go.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.090
Yeah.

15:49.970 --> 15:51.960
- That's good, right?
- That looks good, right?

15:51.960 --> 15:54.520
- You made a mistake.
- We did?

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
Hello?

16:04.570 --> 16:07.240
Oh, excuse me for a bit.

16:09.860 --> 16:10.810
Hello?

16:13.660 --> 16:14.700
Really?

16:19.250 --> 16:20.330
Okay.

16:21.210 --> 16:22.590
I'll be on my way.

16:23.210 --> 16:24.380
Thank you.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.800
Sorry, Miyu.

16:32.970 --> 16:34.970
Something urgent came up, so...

16:35.470 --> 16:37.310
I can't watch the movie.

16:39.020 --> 16:40.250
I'm really sorry.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.230
Urgent?

16:48.030 --> 16:49.190
Just a little...

16:52.700 --> 16:53.700
What the...

16:55.330 --> 16:58.000
Sorry. Next week, I promise!

16:59.660 --> 17:00.660
Sorry.

17:04.920 --> 17:05.920
Miyu?

17:09.170 --> 17:10.050
Okay.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.850
No, it's completely alright.

17:18.810 --> 17:19.980
I'm sorry.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.240
I'm sorry.

17:53.220 --> 17:54.010
Go on.

17:55.430 --> 17:56.210
Eat.

18:10.570 --> 18:12.880
Shuya, clear weather suits you.

18:12.990 --> 18:13.640
Huh?

18:15.030 --> 18:17.240
You're like the blue sky.

18:18.370 --> 18:19.040
What?

18:31.550 --> 18:32.550
Miyu.

18:34.220 --> 18:34.970
Huh?

18:35.550 --> 18:36.760
I promise.

18:38.260 --> 18:42.560
First day of every month,
we'll absolutely go to the movies together.

18:42.810 --> 18:43.930
Absolutely?

18:44.020 --> 18:46.060
Yeah, even if we have a fight.

18:46.270 --> 18:46.910
Huh?

18:48.980 --> 18:50.110
No matter what happens.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.030
Okay.

18:55.150 --> 18:56.320
I promise.

18:57.410 --> 18:58.040
Okay.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.090
Let's come here again.

19:17.820 --> 19:21.260
<i>"Starting Tomorrow, My Love For
Her Will Be Rainy" will start soon...</i>

19:21.350 --> 19:24.550
<i>I shouldn't have made that promise.</i>

19:36.750 --> 19:41.930
<i>[ I want to talk to you again.
I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. ]</i>

20:06.730 --> 20:07.690
I'm sorry.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.440
Miyu!

20:15.320 --> 20:17.490
- Listen to me!
- Enough.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.820
I'm not mad.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.950
If you want to play
with other girls, go ahead.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.580
It's not my business.

20:28.710 --> 20:29.610
What...

20:38.590 --> 20:39.880
I wish...

20:41.590 --> 20:43.470
you would just disappear.

20:45.160 --> 20:45.990
Miyu!

21:28.720 --> 21:29.390
Huh?

21:34.650 --> 21:35.650
A dream?

22:19.270 --> 22:22.490
Good morning. You're finally up.

22:24.790 --> 22:26.370
Why curry again?

22:26.370 --> 22:29.330
Why? Because yesterday's
leftovers would go to waste.

22:29.330 --> 22:30.870
<i>Here is the national weather forecast.</i>

22:30.870 --> 22:34.720
It's recyclable trash day.
Miyu, can you take it out?

22:35.500 --> 22:36.250
What?

22:36.880 --> 22:39.200
Help me out once in a while.

22:39.380 --> 22:43.010
<i>Low pressure will bring
rain in the evening.</i>

22:44.300 --> 22:45.960
<i>Especially in the Kanto region,</i>

22:45.960 --> 22:49.830
<i>there is a possibility of strong
rain with localized thunderstorms, </i>

22:49.830 --> 22:51.930
<i>so please take precautions.</i>

22:53.060 --> 22:55.510
<i>When you go out, even if it's not raining,</i>

22:55.510 --> 22:57.440
<i>don't forget to bring an umbrella.</i>

22:57.520 --> 23:00.050
Mom, is today the 1st?

23:00.570 --> 23:02.550
That's why it's recyclable trash.

23:02.550 --> 23:06.860
<i>Later in the evening, as cold air
moves south, it will get even colder.</i>

23:12.200 --> 23:13.370
You're not gonna eat it?

23:13.540 --> 23:14.330
I'm good!

23:14.830 --> 23:16.210
Hey!

23:21.380 --> 23:22.210
Miyu?

23:26.340 --> 23:27.590
Geez...

23:27.590 --> 23:30.430
Good morning. Thank you.

23:30.430 --> 23:32.140
Have a nice day.

23:32.140 --> 23:35.530
Good morning. Thank you.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.650
Good morning. Thank you.

23:39.310 --> 23:40.980
Have a nice day.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.570
- Whoa, are you okay?
- I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

23:47.650 --> 23:49.030
Ah, it's okay.

23:49.530 --> 23:52.700
It's so embarrassing! Stop it!

23:57.500 --> 23:59.330
Wow, so cold!

24:02.790 --> 24:05.670
What is this? Déjà vu?

24:05.880 --> 24:06.720
Good morning.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.440
- Oh, Sakiko.
- What's wrong?

24:12.640 --> 24:15.220
Shuya's safe, right?

24:15.720 --> 24:16.480
Huh?

24:17.560 --> 24:20.100
No! It's nothing.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.860
Right. Did you study for the test?

24:27.450 --> 24:31.110
Test... English, right?

24:34.120 --> 24:36.660
Here, I'll lend you this.

24:41.710 --> 24:42.630
Miyu?

24:42.630 --> 24:44.800
Oh, sorry, I'm going ahead.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.630
What?

24:52.550 --> 24:54.040
What's wrong with her?

24:55.100 --> 24:56.310
Beats me...

24:56.810 --> 25:01.560
<i>The number you are calling may
not be on, or out of coverage area...</i>

25:23.080 --> 25:24.210
Miyu?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.040
Shuya.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.590
How unusual of you to
come to my classroom.

25:30.470 --> 25:31.800
You're alive...

25:33.800 --> 25:34.720
What?

25:35.130 --> 25:38.100
Hey! Why won't you answer your phone?

25:40.100 --> 25:42.230
Oh, it's out of juice.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.650
Do you have a charger?

25:43.730 --> 25:45.270
Of course not.

25:45.770 --> 25:46.610
You don't...

25:47.230 --> 25:48.280
I do.

25:48.690 --> 25:49.780
Ah, Tomoka.

25:49.950 --> 25:50.830
I'll lend it to you.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.720
- Here.
- Thanks.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.930
As expected of Tomoka.

26:14.430 --> 26:15.430
Well, yeah...

26:19.140 --> 26:20.930
- What's the matter?
- What?

26:24.560 --> 26:27.400
I forgot my world history textbook...

26:27.570 --> 26:29.190
World history...

26:29.900 --> 26:32.240
Oh, sorry, we don't have one today.

26:32.940 --> 26:33.820
Oh.

26:34.370 --> 26:36.240
That's okay. No problem.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.280
Really?

26:37.370 --> 26:38.370
I have mine.

26:38.950 --> 26:40.740
Hey, hey, you left it again?

26:41.750 --> 26:44.460
Maybe I should stop lending it to you.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.350
I'm sorry. Can you lend it to her?

26:46.500 --> 26:47.710
Wait there.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.880
Are you okay?

26:52.170 --> 26:52.830
Yeah.

26:54.130 --> 26:54.970
Here.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.350
Thank you... very much.

26:59.510 --> 27:00.140
Yeah.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.440
Okay, Shuya, treat me
to something next time!

27:05.440 --> 27:06.310
No way!

27:06.720 --> 27:08.750
- It's okay.
- Shuya, you buying?

27:08.750 --> 27:09.980
No, I'll return it.

27:10.070 --> 27:11.650
- I'm good.
- It's okay.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.740
It's okay. It's okay.

27:26.090 --> 27:28.500
World history?
We don't have one today.

27:29.420 --> 27:30.420
I know.

27:33.210 --> 27:35.170
Okay, I'll hand them out.

27:36.470 --> 27:37.520
Ah! Ah!

27:37.880 --> 27:40.770
Score less than 50, and you'll stay
after school to turn in your homework.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.720
Be quiet. Be quiet.

27:45.350 --> 27:46.600
Put your textbooks away.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.920
Write upper case and lower case letters...

27:51.920 --> 27:52.730
<i>It goes in.</i>

28:00.930 --> 28:02.170
What are you daydreaming about?

28:03.120 --> 28:03.830
Here.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.150
It will fly.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.210
Oh, my God.

28:12.210 --> 28:14.340
Sorry, sorry.
Thank you.

28:15.010 --> 28:15.630
Thank you.

28:15.630 --> 28:18.510
<i>Is the same day repeating itself?</i>

28:19.130 --> 28:19.830
Here.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.800
<i>Why can't I remember this one?</i>

28:47.200 --> 28:50.710
I heard growling during the test.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.850
How did you do?
Did you get it?

28:54.870 --> 28:56.570
I got detention.

28:56.570 --> 29:00.180
What?! Today's the first.
You got a date, remember?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.720
Sakiko, will you listen to me?

29:06.200 --> 29:06.880
What?

29:09.060 --> 29:13.440
I think this is the second
time I've spent this day.

29:15.650 --> 29:16.280
Huh?

29:16.490 --> 29:18.900
Yesterday was November 1,

29:19.400 --> 29:22.600
and when I woke up this morning,
it was November 1 again!

29:23.370 --> 29:23.950
What?

29:24.400 --> 29:25.830
What's going on?

29:26.040 --> 29:27.120
It's true!

29:27.450 --> 29:31.410
If we go to the movies today,
something bad will happen.

29:31.750 --> 29:35.970
Is it a prophetic dream thing?

29:37.000 --> 29:37.710
Yeah.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.050
I heard that prophetic dreams
are all subconscious.

29:41.350 --> 29:44.890
I've heard that it's a
manifestation of your desires.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.640
Desire?

29:46.760 --> 29:48.640
Yes. What did you dream about?

29:50.730 --> 29:52.140
Shuya...

29:54.150 --> 29:55.990
will be punished.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.410
Miyu.

29:59.690 --> 30:02.820
You really do care!
About the rumors.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.350
No! That's not it!

30:04.350 --> 30:05.870
Yes, yes, you're right.

30:05.870 --> 30:08.730
Rumor is rumor.
Best not to worry about it.

30:22.850 --> 30:24.090
<i>It's uneven.</i>

30:30.180 --> 30:32.310
You didn't put it straight
in your bag, didn't you?

30:32.810 --> 30:34.270
But it looks delicious.

30:35.770 --> 30:36.860
Want some?

30:37.010 --> 30:38.990
<i>Sakiko chooses the egg rolls.</i>

30:38.990 --> 30:39.770
Are you sure?

30:39.820 --> 30:41.900
- Yeah.
- Then, I won't hesitate!

30:44.990 --> 30:46.490
<i>I knew it.</i>

30:47.120 --> 30:48.830
Delicious!

30:49.640 --> 30:50.870
I'll take one!

30:53.470 --> 30:54.660
- It's really good!
- It's really good!

30:59.130 --> 31:00.000
You...

31:00.550 --> 31:01.840
know what I'm gonna say.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.130
She knows what you'll say.

31:03.510 --> 31:06.470
- She knows.
- She knows.

31:06.470 --> 31:07.650
It's good, right?

31:10.470 --> 31:13.180
<i>I knew it. It is the same.</i>

31:16.640 --> 31:17.650
Miyu...

31:19.730 --> 31:20.520
<i>Here it comes.</i>

31:23.480 --> 31:24.210
What?

31:24.210 --> 31:25.410
Nothing.

31:28.950 --> 31:30.560
Your hair's a mess.

31:30.560 --> 31:34.500
I told you that it won't
keep it together on rainy days.

31:36.530 --> 31:37.250
So?

31:38.290 --> 31:39.120
What is it?

31:39.500 --> 31:40.710
"What is it?"...

31:40.930 --> 31:43.160
You can go to the
movie today, right?

31:44.210 --> 31:46.610
<i>We went to the movies, and Shuya...</i>

31:51.640 --> 31:52.470
Sorry.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.020
I can't go today.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.980
I got detention.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.280
I'll wait.

32:01.610 --> 32:03.710
I don't know when it will be.

32:04.230 --> 32:05.720
It's okay, no problem.

32:05.850 --> 32:06.930
<i>Stubborn.</i>

32:07.130 --> 32:08.400
I've got things to do.

32:08.550 --> 32:09.600
Things to do?

32:09.600 --> 32:11.310
Things to do at home.

32:11.310 --> 32:12.080
For how long?

32:12.160 --> 32:13.950
Anyway!

32:16.410 --> 32:17.790
I can't today.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.590
Sorry.

32:22.670 --> 32:23.760
Okay.

32:27.050 --> 32:27.790
Bye.

32:48.570 --> 32:50.450
See you tomorrow.

32:51.950 --> 32:54.370
You'll go straight home today, right?

33:01.170 --> 33:03.170
- Here!
- Are you done?

33:04.840 --> 33:06.380
Are you okay?

33:07.090 --> 33:07.840
Yes.

33:08.340 --> 33:09.260
What?

33:10.340 --> 33:11.470
Oh, okay...

33:11.970 --> 33:14.600
Okay, okay, okay!

33:14.600 --> 33:17.030
- Detention regular.
- Hello!

33:17.030 --> 33:18.640
- Starting tomorrow, okay?
- Yes, sir.

33:22.230 --> 33:23.650
- Don't detour, just go home.
- Yes, sir.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.150
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

33:26.860 --> 33:27.860
Movie...

33:29.360 --> 33:30.570
you're not going?

33:33.110 --> 33:36.780
<i>If he doesn't go to the movies, he'll be fine.</i>

33:37.830 --> 33:39.870
Ah! Hey... Come on.

33:39.950 --> 33:42.670
- Come on, come on. Shh...
- Ouch! What are you doing?

33:47.710 --> 33:51.590
I really don't get you guys.

33:53.190 --> 33:55.260
I don't even know myself.

34:03.120 --> 34:09.000
<i>[ I'm watching this today.
If you change your mind, just come. ]</i>

34:12.030 --> 34:15.010

<i>[ Starting Tomorrow,

34:20.870 --> 34:22.460
Sorry! I'm going ahead.

34:22.640 --> 34:23.160
What?

34:23.250 --> 34:24.870
Sorry! See you tomorrow!

34:24.960 --> 34:26.290
Hey, Miyu!

34:35.550 --> 34:38.640
Wow, I want to watch this next month.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.970
- Which one?
- This one, this one.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.140
A sci-fi, "Concluder".

34:43.230 --> 34:44.190
Oh...

34:44.270 --> 34:46.730
What about you?
Anything you want to watch?

34:49.900 --> 34:51.440
Shuya, you idiot!

35:02.910 --> 35:04.410
Oh, come on!

35:16.220 --> 35:17.040
Found him.

35:27.020 --> 35:29.610
♪ Happy birthday to you

- Wow!
- Let's take out the sparklers.

35:56.630 --> 35:58.970
Stop, stop! It's dangerous.

35:58.970 --> 36:01.470
I'm sorry. Can I make a call?

36:15.690 --> 36:16.690
Miyu?

36:21.660 --> 36:22.660
Hello.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.790
What are you doing here?

36:27.250 --> 36:29.620
Oh, um...

36:30.880 --> 36:34.320
I thought you can't go
to the movies today.

36:36.380 --> 36:38.380
Oh, um...

36:40.800 --> 36:43.220
I was just returning this.

36:44.810 --> 36:46.350
Thank you very much.

36:48.730 --> 36:49.730
Good.

36:50.940 --> 36:51.610
What?

36:52.400 --> 36:54.270
Let me be with him today.

36:57.860 --> 36:58.640
Bye.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.400
Hey!

37:13.920 --> 37:17.630
Today... don't let Shuya
go to the movies.

37:20.380 --> 37:21.690
Please.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.070
I intend to.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.700
Hold this, hold this,
both of you hold this.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.500
I'm okay with this.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.980
I saved him...

38:21.860 --> 38:23.240
Thank goodness...

38:48.610 --> 38:49.800
Hello?

38:53.560 --> 38:55.270
Here, your lunch box.

38:55.350 --> 38:56.310
Thanks.

38:57.690 --> 39:00.070
Oh? Shuya's not with you?

39:01.320 --> 39:02.040
Yeah.

39:03.990 --> 39:05.570
Did something happen?

39:09.280 --> 39:10.280
What about the movie?

39:11.080 --> 39:13.120
Today's the first, right?

39:14.570 --> 39:17.170
There it is, Yuto's meddling.

39:19.130 --> 39:20.450
What the hell is he doing?

39:23.090 --> 39:25.420
Today I told him I can't go.

39:26.930 --> 39:27.930
Why?

39:29.640 --> 39:31.010
A lot of things happened.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.270
Are you okay?

39:39.650 --> 39:40.860
I'm okay.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.570
Are you?

39:45.240 --> 39:48.320
Your nosiness is hard-core, isn't it

39:50.530 --> 39:52.370
I'm not being nosy.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.790
I don't like it when you cry.

40:07.380 --> 40:09.650
- Thanks for the surprise.
- Not at all.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.880
It's great that everyone was there.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.550
I'm glad.

40:13.550 --> 40:15.490
Everyone had a great time, didn't they?

40:17.480 --> 40:18.730
Shuya...

40:27.320 --> 40:28.570
Don't go.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.210
I...

40:39.540 --> 40:42.630
I like you.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.470
Sorry, I have to go!

41:03.480 --> 41:04.940
Shuya!

41:08.360 --> 41:09.400
Shuya!

41:33.390 --> 41:35.100
Hey! Hey, you there!

41:36.930 --> 41:38.520
Are you okay?

41:40.020 --> 41:42.730
Are you okay?
Can you answer me?

41:57.160 --> 42:00.540
Shuya... Why?

42:35.950 --> 42:37.070
I'm back.

42:38.330 --> 42:41.620
<i>It's not a dream.
It's definitely repeating itself.</i>

42:41.770 --> 42:43.360
Ah, Shuya!

42:49.080 --> 42:53.760
<i>The number you are calling
may not be on or out of coverage...</i>

43:09.940 --> 43:10.810
Miyu?

43:12.490 --> 43:13.370
Good morning.

43:13.780 --> 43:14.810
Aren't you late for today?

43:17.660 --> 43:20.740
I was waiting for you, Shuya.

43:20.890 --> 43:21.520
What?

43:22.950 --> 43:25.120
I can't call your phone.

43:26.290 --> 43:27.920
It must be low battery.

43:30.340 --> 43:30.930
Yes.

43:37.010 --> 43:38.560
- What's wrong?
- What?

43:39.930 --> 43:41.720
Ah... nothing.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.650
You don't have a fever.

43:49.900 --> 43:52.360
You okay?
You're spacing out.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.730
That startled me...

44:10.130 --> 44:10.830
Huh?

44:12.420 --> 44:15.840
I thought I hadn't seen it in a while.

44:17.010 --> 44:17.650
Huh?

44:18.050 --> 44:19.590
Your smile.

44:22.210 --> 44:23.680
What are you talking about?

44:23.930 --> 44:25.180
Well, because...

44:26.060 --> 44:30.160
recently you're kind of moody
and not feeling well.

44:32.570 --> 44:35.400
Because of...

44:37.150 --> 44:38.070
the rain!

44:39.700 --> 44:40.780
I prefer you that way.

44:42.070 --> 44:43.530
I prefer you smiling.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.590
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

45:01.830 --> 45:02.890
<i>A desire?</i>

45:04.220 --> 45:05.220
<i>No.</i>

45:05.310 --> 45:07.390
You can go today, right?
To the movies.

45:08.350 --> 45:09.100
Yeah.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.480
Okay.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.230
<i>I want to save Shuya.</i>

45:16.030 --> 45:17.070
Shuya.

45:17.230 --> 45:17.760
Yeah?

45:18.190 --> 45:19.780
Can we leave early today?

45:20.490 --> 45:21.360
Okay.

45:38.460 --> 45:39.630
I'll go buy some.

45:39.630 --> 45:41.510
- Whoa!
- Whoops.

45:42.680 --> 45:43.910
What the heck...

45:44.350 --> 45:45.390
You're late.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.440
<i>I like you.</i>

45:53.520 --> 45:55.880
Ah, yeah...

46:06.740 --> 46:08.080
Are you okay?

46:11.290 --> 46:13.830
Yeah, I'm okay.

46:20.450 --> 46:22.760
If you forget a period, you lose a point.

46:25.280 --> 46:25.920
Here.

46:27.870 --> 46:29.310
You're motivated, aren't you?

46:29.430 --> 46:30.090
I am!

46:31.710 --> 46:32.600
Did you get it?

46:32.770 --> 46:33.850
Perfect!

46:37.020 --> 46:38.610
Here, an egg roll!

46:42.650 --> 46:43.250
Here.

46:44.110 --> 46:45.280
Thank you.

46:47.990 --> 46:49.200
- It's really good!
- It's really good!

47:04.590 --> 47:05.800
Miyu?

47:08.760 --> 47:11.470
Thanks for the textbook the other day.

47:11.560 --> 47:12.230
What?

47:12.890 --> 47:13.600
Huh?

47:14.600 --> 47:17.940
Oh... it's nothing.

47:19.190 --> 47:21.860
Shuya was here a while ago...

47:22.940 --> 47:23.780
Movie?

47:24.860 --> 47:25.530
Huh?

47:26.360 --> 47:27.710
Shuya told me

47:27.960 --> 47:29.990
that the first of every
month is movie day.

47:33.000 --> 47:33.790
Yes.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.620
That's nice.

47:38.290 --> 47:41.840
But isn't it lonely if
that's all there is?

47:46.630 --> 47:48.470
If I were you,
I'd want to see him more.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.470
Take better care of him.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.170
- Even I...
- Ow, ow, ow!

47:58.170 --> 47:58.950
Ah, Shuya.

48:00.770 --> 48:01.720
Oh, Miyu!

48:06.360 --> 48:07.280
Wait here a bit.

48:07.550 --> 48:08.160
Okay.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.430
See ya...

48:31.090 --> 48:32.350
Hey, Shuya.

48:33.350 --> 48:34.770
I have a favor to ask.

48:34.850 --> 48:35.430
Huh?

48:37.310 --> 48:39.390
Turn off your phone.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.570
What? Now? Isn't it better
when the movie starts?

48:42.570 --> 48:44.250
I need you to turn it off now.

48:44.820 --> 48:45.840
What's the matter?

48:46.150 --> 48:47.200
Please.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.990
Just for today, listen to me.

48:53.780 --> 48:54.580
Okay.

49:00.290 --> 49:01.240
Is that okay?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.640
- Thank you.
- Okay.

49:05.800 --> 49:06.880
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

49:07.760 --> 49:10.380
<i>I can save him for sure today.</i>

49:10.760 --> 49:13.550
<i>"Starting Tomorrow,
My Love For Her Will Be Rainy"</i>

49:13.550 --> 49:15.810
<i>will be starting soon.</i>

49:15.890 --> 49:16.550
Let's go.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.610
Shuya.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.410
Tomoka?

49:21.410 --> 49:22.510
<i>Why is she here?</i>

49:22.510 --> 49:23.760
I finally found you.

49:24.060 --> 49:25.980
I can't get a hold of you at all.

49:26.070 --> 49:27.530
Oh, sorry.

49:28.440 --> 49:29.530
Can we talk for a bit?

49:30.360 --> 49:31.030
Okay.

49:31.780 --> 49:32.910
Wait here.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.460
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll go ahead.

49:57.010 --> 49:58.350
Miyu, I'm sorry.

49:58.430 --> 50:00.270
Can we do the movie next week?

50:04.100 --> 50:05.310
Did something happen?

50:06.570 --> 50:08.190
It's an emergency...

50:09.780 --> 50:11.150
I'm really sorry.

50:13.860 --> 50:16.950
You promised you'd
listen to me today,

50:16.950 --> 50:18.620
didn't you?

50:19.950 --> 50:20.790
I'm sorry.

50:21.660 --> 50:22.830
Don't go.

50:23.330 --> 50:24.960
- Miyu.
- Please!

50:27.840 --> 50:28.680
Sorry.

50:38.470 --> 50:40.100
If you insist on going...

50:44.230 --> 50:45.310
then let's break up.

50:47.230 --> 50:48.070
What?

50:49.030 --> 50:50.720
You're choosing her, aren't you?

50:51.270 --> 50:53.490
- What are you saying?
- I'm serious.

50:53.990 --> 50:55.410
My last request.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.450
After today, you and I can break up.

51:00.540 --> 51:03.410
So, just for today...

51:04.120 --> 51:05.120
Please.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.040
Miyu.

51:09.530 --> 51:11.590
Are you really thinking that?

51:12.340 --> 51:13.130
What?

51:14.080 --> 51:17.680
You can decide if it's
the last time or breaking up.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.530
If you have something to say, say it!

51:20.140 --> 51:23.730
Shuya, don't just hide and sneak around,

51:23.730 --> 51:26.100
speak up!
- What about you, Miyu?

51:28.560 --> 51:31.570
You've never once told
me how you really feel.

51:42.660 --> 51:44.000
I'm going.

52:33.530 --> 52:34.300
Huh?

52:41.140 --> 52:42.230
Hello?

52:42.790 --> 52:44.480
<i>Hello? It's me.</i>

52:45.020 --> 52:47.560
<i>You forgot your lunch box, didn't you?</i>

52:47.640 --> 52:49.650
Oh, yeah...

52:49.650 --> 52:50.750
<i>I forgot.</i>

52:52.810 --> 52:56.410
Oh, and I don't mean to be nosy,

52:57.490 --> 53:02.070
<i>but I asked Shuya
about the rumors with Tomoka.</i>

53:02.820 --> 53:06.640
He said they were just part-timers.

53:07.790 --> 53:08.500
What?

53:08.640 --> 53:10.710
<i>That guy must be
working part-time too.</i>

53:11.420 --> 53:12.580
<i>So...</i>

53:13.540 --> 53:15.300
don't worry about it anymore.

53:16.950 --> 53:17.750
<i>Bye.</i>

53:30.480 --> 53:34.330
<i>[ I want to talk to you again.
I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. ]</i>

53:56.850 --> 53:57.890
Shuya!

54:02.220 --> 54:04.260
Shuya!

54:05.430 --> 54:06.470
Shuya!

54:36.330 --> 54:37.250
Shuya!

54:38.380 --> 54:39.490
Shuya!

54:41.670 --> 54:42.640
Shuya!

54:45.050 --> 54:47.720
Somebody! Help!

54:48.010 --> 54:48.990
Somebody!

54:59.560 --> 55:02.650
Please! Turn it back!

55:03.400 --> 55:04.570
I beg of you!

55:05.070 --> 55:06.230
One more time...

55:08.660 --> 55:09.950
Please!

55:33.750 --> 55:34.560
Okay.

55:43.780 --> 55:47.490
<i>Taurus, today brings you good luck.</i>

55:48.160 --> 55:52.840
<i>Positive attitude toward
everything will bring good results.</i>

55:55.230 --> 55:55.950
Good morning.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.250
Good morning.

55:59.580 --> 56:01.490
Do you do that every day?

56:03.000 --> 56:06.550
You think the creases on your skirt
would straighten on their own?

56:08.220 --> 56:09.160
Thanks.

56:09.890 --> 56:11.790
Wait a minute.
I'll get you breakfast.

56:11.790 --> 56:13.640
I'll pack your lunch first.

56:20.230 --> 56:21.770
<i>I didn't notice it.</i>

56:25.240 --> 56:28.320
<i>I thought I was repeating
the same day over and over.</i>

56:29.570 --> 56:30.100
Here.

56:32.580 --> 56:33.600
Have a nice day.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.950
- I'm off.
- Okay.

56:38.830 --> 56:40.730
- Bye.
- Yeah, have a nice day.

56:41.940 --> 56:42.530
<i>But...</i>

56:43.170 --> 56:47.840
<i>every day that I thought was the same
was that every day was different.</i>

56:47.920 --> 56:50.680
Thank you. Have a nice day.

56:51.260 --> 56:54.210
<i>If I can change it,
I'm sure it will change.</i>

56:54.210 --> 56:56.270
Good morning. Thank you.

56:56.350 --> 56:58.430
Good morning.
I'm off.

56:58.590 --> 56:59.520
Have a nice day.

57:04.940 --> 57:06.480
Hey, let's go!

57:07.070 --> 57:07.900
Look!

57:09.320 --> 57:10.860
Wow, amazing!

57:13.800 --> 57:14.620
Sakiko!

57:15.990 --> 57:18.040
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

57:18.120 --> 57:19.370
You waited for me?

57:19.460 --> 57:20.330
Yeah.

57:21.670 --> 57:24.170
I just want to talk to you.

57:26.050 --> 57:28.860
I see. So they were part-timers.

57:29.060 --> 57:29.760
Yeah.

57:32.140 --> 57:37.100
I was afraid to confirm
the truth with Shuya.

57:38.020 --> 57:39.020
Miyu...

57:40.390 --> 57:41.640
I always wondered

57:43.070 --> 57:47.230
what Shuya liked about me.

57:48.320 --> 57:51.240
Do you not trust Shuya?

57:52.530 --> 57:53.530
It's not that.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.270
I'm just not sure of myself.

57:58.370 --> 57:59.330
Miyu...

58:00.000 --> 58:03.210
We started going out
on a whim, didn't we?

58:06.090 --> 58:07.380
It's not on a whim.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.500
What?

58:11.420 --> 58:15.720
If you say it was on a whim,
I feel sorry for Shuya.

58:18.830 --> 58:19.940
What do you mean?

58:21.810 --> 58:27.230
I was told this would
be an absolute secret.

58:29.610 --> 58:31.280
Ah, Sakiko.

58:32.030 --> 58:34.240
Tell me a movie you think Miyu would like.

58:34.360 --> 58:36.390
- A movie Miyu might like?
- Shh!

58:38.290 --> 58:39.240
Tell me.

58:41.080 --> 58:43.230
That confession
during the first year...

58:43.600 --> 58:45.290
I was thinking of going too.

58:47.420 --> 58:51.380
Shuya asked us to do it,
and we all set it up.

58:53.630 --> 58:54.340
What?

58:57.680 --> 59:02.930
Shuya had been in love with
you for a long time.

59:08.230 --> 59:10.960
Ah... I feel so much better.

59:11.280 --> 59:12.740
I finally said it.

59:20.680 --> 59:21.500
Thank you.

59:25.400 --> 59:30.540
Shuya really loves you, Miyu.

59:31.380 --> 59:31.950
Yes.

59:33.010 --> 59:34.380
What about you, Miyu?

59:36.890 --> 59:37.890
I'll...

59:39.600 --> 59:41.390
talk to Shuya properly.

59:45.640 --> 59:48.350
Ah! Sakiko, aren't
you on school duty today?

59:48.440 --> 59:50.030
I've got the test today. So go!

59:50.030 --> 59:51.870
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

59:56.460 --> 59:57.350
Yuto!

59:58.870 --> 59:59.990
What the heck...

1:00:00.490 --> 1:00:03.580
That scared me...
Don't turn around so suddenly.

1:00:03.580 --> 1:00:04.350
Good morning.

1:00:07.900 --> 1:00:10.960
What's up? You're looking well...

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:11.790
Yeah.

1:00:13.100 --> 1:00:13.990
I...

1:00:15.790 --> 1:00:17.070
am okay now.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:20.850
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.430
Thank you for your concern.

1:00:25.250 --> 1:00:27.600
I'm not really concerned, though.

1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:30.440
Oh, you are nosy.

1:00:31.070 --> 1:00:31.720
Hey.

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:35.240
But...

1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:40.920
thanks for your meddling.

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:46.600
Hey.

1:00:49.550 --> 1:00:50.450
Good luck.

1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:53.380
Okay.

1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:15.190
Miyu?

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:18.860
Is Shuya in here?

1:01:19.950 --> 1:01:21.160
Movie day, right?

1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:27.910
Shuya told me that the
first of every month is movie day.

1:01:29.330 --> 1:01:30.000
Yes.

1:01:31.830 --> 1:01:32.890
That's nice.

1:01:34.790 --> 1:01:36.920
But isn't it lonely if
that's all there is?

1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:45.010
If I were you,
I'd want to see him more.

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:48.170
Take better care of him.

1:01:54.110 --> 1:01:55.060
I do take care of him.

1:01:59.030 --> 1:02:02.150
I care about him a lot.

1:02:16.710 --> 1:02:17.590
Miyu?

1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:19.810
Ah, Shuya.

1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:23.500
I have a favor to ask.

1:02:24.660 --> 1:02:25.180
Huh?

1:02:44.950 --> 1:02:45.820
Am I heavy?

1:02:45.910 --> 1:02:47.120
More than before.

1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:50.330
That's harsh.
Then why are we riding a bike?

1:02:50.330 --> 1:02:52.070
Yuto said we could ride it.

1:02:52.870 --> 1:02:54.050
He's so nosy.

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:56.460
So what's the matter?

1:02:56.540 --> 1:02:57.290
What?

1:02:57.380 --> 1:02:58.210
Your hair!

1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:01.420
Ah... weird, isn't it?

1:03:01.510 --> 1:03:03.590
It looks so good on you!

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:06.550
Hey!

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.060
You think they know I skipped class?

1:03:10.890 --> 1:03:12.290
Are you freaking out maybe?

1:03:12.290 --> 1:03:13.680
No, I'm not.

1:03:13.770 --> 1:03:15.230
Shut up.

1:03:30.910 --> 1:03:33.080
I wanted to come here
one more time.

1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:39.260
Shuya.

1:03:43.130 --> 1:03:46.530
Is it true you're working part-time?

1:03:48.050 --> 1:03:49.550
How did you know that...

1:03:56.730 --> 1:03:59.520
Was it Tomoka?

1:04:00.570 --> 1:04:02.820
I heard you two
were working together.

1:04:04.530 --> 1:04:05.780
It's just a coincidence.

1:04:07.070 --> 1:04:08.780
A rental store at the next station

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:12.640
Because we finish late,

1:04:12.950 --> 1:04:15.680
the manager asks me
to walk her to the station,

1:04:18.460 --> 1:04:20.000
so we sometimes go home together.

1:04:23.210 --> 1:04:25.210
Why didn't you tell me?

1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:27.470
About your part-time job.

1:04:29.390 --> 1:04:30.680
It's...

1:04:52.530 --> 1:04:53.960
For our anniversary.

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:57.220
What?

1:04:58.540 --> 1:05:00.500
Because I forgot last year...

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:06.550
our first year anniversary
since we started dating.

1:05:09.010 --> 1:05:11.510
That you had prepared a present for me...

1:05:14.010 --> 1:05:16.020
and Sakiko told me about it later.

1:05:21.150 --> 1:05:23.060
I regretted it so much.

1:05:27.150 --> 1:05:29.150
So, I've been working
part-time secretly...

1:05:48.030 --> 1:05:49.050
I promise.

1:05:52.390 --> 1:05:54.390
I'll do it right on our 2nd anniversary.

1:05:58.430 --> 1:06:00.230
You are an idiot.

1:06:00.310 --> 1:06:01.600
Idiot...

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:03.940
Why don't you tell me?

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:07.180
Why...

1:06:08.900 --> 1:06:10.740
To surprise you?

1:06:18.910 --> 1:06:20.500
Why are you crying?

1:06:21.610 --> 1:06:22.870
I'm not crying.

1:06:24.460 --> 1:06:25.230
Miyu.

1:06:26.380 --> 1:06:27.880
I'm not crying.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:35.990
I...

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:42.020
love it when you smile.

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:55.620
Do you remember
the first day we met?

1:06:57.910 --> 1:06:58.740
I do.

1:07:50.290 --> 1:07:51.840
It was love at first sight.

1:07:53.550 --> 1:07:54.550
You're lying.

1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:00.350
Your smile made me smile too.

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:03.600
So...

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:07.270
I want you to keep smiling.

1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:12.220
Yeah.

1:09:16.510 --> 1:09:18.920
- Happy birthday!
- You're 18!

1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:22.300
You're 18, first shot,
where do you want to go?

1:09:23.050 --> 1:09:25.160
- We should go somewhere together.
- Camping.

1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:26.430
Not at an amusement park?

1:09:26.430 --> 1:09:29.520
Then, let's have Tomoka,
our star decide.

1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:31.730
You're right.
Where do you want to go?

1:09:31.730 --> 1:09:33.330
Sorry. Can I make a quick call?

1:09:33.330 --> 1:09:34.400
Ah... okay, okay.

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:36.030
Then we'll decide on our own.

1:09:36.150 --> 1:09:39.150
We'll decide on our own.
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:47.410
Sorry. Miyu.

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:50.540
I have a part-time job today...

1:09:51.830 --> 1:09:54.670
Shuya, do you know?

1:09:58.550 --> 1:10:02.380
We can go to the
movies not just on the 1st,

1:10:03.390 --> 1:10:04.860
but we can watch it anytime.

1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:08.770
That's why...

1:10:13.150 --> 1:10:14.560
I want to see you more.

1:10:19.650 --> 1:10:20.350
Okay.

1:10:22.910 --> 1:10:24.280
Today is all good.

1:10:25.660 --> 1:10:26.620
Let's go again.

1:10:27.700 --> 1:10:29.750
Yeah, thanks.

1:10:39.260 --> 1:10:40.460
See you tomorrow.

1:10:47.890 --> 1:10:52.010
<i>I want you to smile, too.</i>

1:11:01.110 --> 1:11:02.110
Tomoka.

1:11:04.610 --> 1:11:05.870
Thanks for calling me.

1:11:06.950 --> 1:11:08.600
The part-time job?
Are you not going?

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:13.080
Shuya, I need to talk to you.

1:11:13.370 --> 1:11:13.960
Huh?

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:20.500
I'm sorry.

1:11:22.130 --> 1:11:23.550
I lied.

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:31.090
I really wanna be with you today.

1:11:33.810 --> 1:11:37.980
You lied about having a shift?

1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:43.240
I like you, Shuya.

1:11:54.660 --> 1:11:55.660
I'm sorry.

1:11:58.710 --> 1:11:59.710
I'm sorry.

1:12:16.940 --> 1:12:17.810
Tomoka.

1:12:23.570 --> 1:12:24.880
Happy birthday.

1:12:49.930 --> 1:12:52.600
<i>[ No part-time.
I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower.
I want to see you. ]</i>

1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:54.310
<i>No matter how many times it is repeated,</i>

1:12:56.810 --> 1:12:59.080
<i>I may not be able to change his fate.</i>

1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:07.260
<i>But still...</i>

1:13:11.660 --> 1:13:13.740
<i>I want to save Shuya.</i>

1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:55.240
Shuya!

1:14:32.850 --> 1:14:33.780
Miyu...

1:14:36.910 --> 1:14:37.870
Miyu!

1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:43.080
Miyu! Somebody!

1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:44.310
Miyu...

1:14:44.410 --> 1:14:47.340
Are you okay? Somebody,
somebody call an ambulance!

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:49.260
Somebody!

1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:52.930
Miyu! Are you okay...

1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:54.750
Miyu!

1:15:17.370 --> 1:15:19.020
Thank goodness...

1:15:37.390 --> 1:15:38.240
Miyu...

1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:52.400
Miyu...

1:15:58.910 --> 1:16:01.410
Miyu!

1:16:25.730 --> 1:16:26.730
Miyu?

1:16:28.900 --> 1:16:31.360
Ah, Miyu...

1:16:32.650 --> 1:16:34.570
I'm glad you're safe.

1:16:35.070 --> 1:16:36.200
Mom.

1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:39.360
Thank goodness...

1:16:42.030 --> 1:16:43.240
Shuya...

1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:48.460
What about Shuya?

1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:53.210
Shuya saved you.

1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:00.820
What do you mean?

1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:08.730
He protected you when
you almost got run over...

1:17:41.090 --> 1:17:42.020
<i>Miyu.</i>

1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:45.350
<i>- Listen to me!
- Enough.</i>

1:17:46.850 --> 1:17:48.640
<i>I'm not mad.</i>

1:17:50.310 --> 1:17:52.850
<i>If you want to play
with other girls, go ahead.</i>

1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:57.440
<i>It's not my business.</i>

1:18:11.710 --> 1:18:12.620
<i>Miyu!</i>

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:53.540
Shuya...

1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:58.050
Wake up.

1:19:03.130 --> 1:19:06.140
No, Shuya! Wake up!

1:19:06.930 --> 1:19:07.970
Please!

1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:09.470
Wake up!

1:19:10.730 --> 1:19:11.890
Miyu...

1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:21.740
Shuya...

1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:26.490
Miyu...

1:19:31.620 --> 1:19:33.120
Shuya.

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:41.090
Miyu.

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:21.650
<i>[ To Miyu ] </i>

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:24.090
Shuya was holding on to it.

1:20:58.830 --> 1:20:59.960
<i>To Miyu.</i>

1:21:02.090 --> 1:21:06.590
<i>I can't speak honestly
when I'm face to face with you.</i>

1:21:07.050 --> 1:21:08.510
<i>So I'm writing you a letter.</i>

1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:27.260
<i>I'm sorry we haven't
spoken more often lately.</i>

1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:35.600
Delicious!

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:37.090
You're exaggerating.

1:21:37.370 --> 1:21:39.370
I'll take one!

1:21:40.790 --> 1:21:42.880
It's really good!

1:21:45.210 --> 1:21:50.800
<i>I haven't seen your
smiling face for a while.</i>

1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:53.220
He's here.

1:22:02.230 --> 1:22:04.620
- Okay, I'll record it.
- Okay, nice.

1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:05.570
Ready!

1:22:09.530 --> 1:22:11.610
Yay!

1:22:11.610 --> 1:22:12.780
I made a mistake.

1:22:17.950 --> 1:22:19.960
I'll go on ahead. Sorry, sorry.

1:22:20.660 --> 1:22:21.500
Miyu!

1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:29.390
<i>Soon it will be our
two-year anniversary.</i>

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:33.130
<i>I'm sorry about last year.</i>

1:22:41.430 --> 1:22:43.190
<i>This anniversary,</i>

1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:47.150
<i>I want to make you smile.</i>

1:22:49.530 --> 1:22:51.610
<i>I want to spend time
with you this year.</i>

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:41.950
<i>I wanna be with you</i>

1:23:42.950 --> 1:23:44.430
<i>forever and ever.</i>

1:23:57.720 --> 1:23:58.720
<i>Shuya.</i>

1:25:07.870 --> 1:25:09.750
<i>I thought it would never end.</i>

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:16.210
<i>I thought the same day
would go on forever.</i>

1:25:21.770 --> 1:25:22.930
Miyu!

1:25:25.430 --> 1:25:26.560
<i>But...</i>

1:25:27.930 --> 1:25:30.690
<i>every day was
a completely different day.</i>

1:25:33.820 --> 1:25:39.600
<i>Every day ends
and a new day begins again.</i>

1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:46.040
<i>And one day,
the end will come.</i>

1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:51.810
<i>But I'm not afraid.</i>

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:58.160
<i>I live every day
as if it were my last.</i>

1:26:23.030 --> 1:26:28.700
<i>Even if it's sad or painful,
I feel it as much as I can </i>

1:26:28.790 --> 1:26:31.080
<i>and create a different everyday.</i>

1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:34.670
<i>When I'm sad, I look at the sky,</i>

1:26:36.250 --> 1:26:39.050
<i>when I'm in pain, I look at my feet,</i>

1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:43.260
<i>and pick up a smile.</i>

1:26:57.980 --> 1:26:59.860
<i>The rain will clear up someday,</i>

1:27:00.070 --> 1:27:03.820
<i>and the blue sky will spread
out in the sky and under my feet,</i>

1:27:04.570 --> 1:27:07.330
<i>as long as I keep smiling.</i>

1:27:30.180 --> 1:27:31.050
Miyu!

1:27:58.500 --> 1:27:59.960
I missed you so much.

1:28:07.590 --> 1:28:08.850
I love you.

1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:29.280
I love you too.
