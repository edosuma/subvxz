03:34.959 --> 03:41.600
Poor, poor, Dan O'Reilly.
Sit, sir. Drink with me.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.740
Hello.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.780
One more crack about
the Irish, Mr. Lamb…

03:45.880 --> 03:47.500
- And I'll shoot you.
- Excuse me?

03:47.600 --> 03:50.260
Am I clear?
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.020
I'm supposed to meet a man here.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.900
Let us drink then to the Irish.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.260
Have you seen anyone?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.361
No finer race of men
have ever peeled a potato.

03:57.841 --> 04:02.141
- Do you pray, Mr. Lamb?
- Good lord, son. No, I do not.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.741
I'm to meet a man here
to take me to the compound.

04:04.841 --> 04:07.021
Let us change our toast, sir.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.721
To the God who has forgotten us.

04:11.681 --> 04:14.421
But first, cardinal rule…

04:14.521 --> 04:16.522
Do you have a bathroom?

04:21.722 --> 04:24.822
Perhaps you've read
On the Origin of the Species

04:24.922 --> 04:28.362
by Means of Natural Selection
by Charles Darwin?

05:28.446 --> 05:30.446
You the one going to
the compound?

05:33.086 --> 05:35.086
Uh, yeah.

06:06.008 --> 06:08.008
This isn't
a god damn beauty spa.

06:09.288 --> 06:11.288
Don't waste water.

06:51.010 --> 06:54.450
$100 for the gas,
$20 for the water.

06:55.530 --> 06:57.530
I'll add that to the $200
you owe me for the ride.

07:03.811 --> 07:05.811
I thought gas was included
in the $200?

07:08.691 --> 07:10.691
Is that a problem?

07:12.531 --> 07:14.471
Because I can turn back?

07:14.571 --> 07:16.571
No, no problem, I'm…

07:18.972 --> 07:21.152
I thought it was $200,
that's all.

07:21.252 --> 07:22.332
Well, I figured the company

07:22.372 --> 07:24.372
would have given you
the details.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.112
They said that there
was a man driving out this way

07:27.212 --> 07:29.212
and that it was $200
to get a ride.

07:29.692 --> 07:32.132
Well, they should have told you
that gas and whatnot is extra.

07:43.653 --> 07:45.653
It's fine.

08:13.175 --> 08:15.515
Leave it on there. You'll blow
the engine.

08:15.615 --> 08:17.915
Bitcoin is currently trading

08:18.015 --> 08:20.835
at 1.25 million US dollars.

08:20.935 --> 08:24.915
Leading charity cryptocoin
Avatar Eclipse

08:25.015 --> 08:26.755
contributed another one million
in aid

08:26.855 --> 08:29.396
to the Northern Territory
caught in the crossfire.

08:30.656 --> 08:34.476
It's now trading at 2244 US dollars

08:34.576 --> 08:37.096
or 14,500 Yen.

10:07.661 --> 10:09.801
You sure you don't need
any help with that?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.901
I got it.

10:18.381 --> 10:19.922
When you and your driver
double shift,

10:20.022 --> 10:22.022
you'll always de-lug like that?

10:22.502 --> 10:24.502
I said, I got it.

10:37.423 --> 10:39.423
Go on! Leave it alone.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.030
Came from the west, right?

12:46.110 --> 12:48.110
Thereabouts, yeah.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.390
I hear it's getting pretty bad
out that way now.

12:53.950 --> 12:55.170
It's not good.

12:55.270 --> 12:57.270
Folks turning on each other?

12:58.350 --> 13:00.350
Yeah.

13:01.830 --> 13:03.771
Seeing that mass exodus
down south there,

13:03.871 --> 13:05.871
that ain't gonna end well.

13:06.951 --> 13:08.951
I don't follow it that close.

13:12.431 --> 13:15.651
Yeah, pretty soon
there'll be hordes of people

13:15.751 --> 13:17.751
coming out this way.

13:23.112 --> 13:25.112
What happened to your face?

13:26.352 --> 13:27.492
What happened?

13:27.592 --> 13:28.612
Yeah.

13:28.712 --> 13:29.812
Nothing happened.

13:29.912 --> 13:31.372
You got that big old scar
on there,

13:31.472 --> 13:33.292
look like someone
might have jumped you.

13:33.392 --> 13:35.392
Does it matter?

13:38.112 --> 13:40.313
Not to me, no, I'm just making
conversation is all.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.393
No-one back west
worth staying for, huh?

13:49.273 --> 13:51.273
No.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.433
You?

13:54.793 --> 13:56.794
Nah, not me, no.

14:00.154 --> 14:02.354
I got used to being alone
a long time ago.

14:09.754 --> 14:11.754
Yeah, me too.

14:13.194 --> 14:15.195
So, why the compound?

14:16.115 --> 14:18.115
Seems a strange place
to be heading.

14:19.955 --> 14:21.535
You're going there.

14:21.635 --> 14:23.795
Yeah, but I mean,
I'm in and out, so…

14:25.235 --> 14:27.235
Opportunity.

14:49.476 --> 14:51.477
Once in a lifetime opportunity.

14:53.957 --> 14:55.957
Let me look at that.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.537
Go on, let me have a look.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.637
Please.

15:08.557 --> 15:10.558
Wow!

15:11.718 --> 15:13.918
In just four months
you'll be a changed man, huh?

15:21.318 --> 15:24.218
I'd take what they say
with a grain of salt, you know?

15:24.318 --> 15:26.374
I mean, I don't mean to
rain on your parade or nothing,

15:26.398 --> 15:28.619
but those places
and the people who run them,

15:28.719 --> 15:32.779
they just talk it up to get
the likes of you out here.

15:32.879 --> 15:34.879
The likes of me?

15:35.999 --> 15:37.999
Where I'm from ain't no picnic
neither.

15:38.879 --> 15:42.059
Well, I daresay whatever you've
come from ain't very pretty,

15:42.159 --> 15:44.199
but where you're heading
certainly ain't any better.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.320
I'll tell you that much
for free.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.140
It's hard labour.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.640
Shitty hours, real dirty work.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
I'm not afraid of hard work.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.320
Yeah, well, it ain't just
the hard work.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.880
It's the whole damn place.

16:06.641 --> 16:08.641
People there have got that look
in their eye.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.741
And there's you coming in
with your little puppy dog eyes

16:15.841 --> 16:17.021
and your quiet nature,

16:17.121 --> 16:18.497
and you're gonna have
a right time of it,

16:18.521 --> 16:20.621
you're gonna be a target.

16:20.721 --> 16:22.722
I can handle it.

16:27.642 --> 16:29.642
I'm sure you can.

17:44.766 --> 17:46.766
What did you just fucking do?

17:49.046 --> 17:51.046
Pull the fuck over!

17:53.887 --> 17:56.867
Jesus fuck god damn Christ!

17:56.967 --> 17:58.967
I told you not to turn it
all the way up!

18:06.287 --> 18:08.287
Fuck!

18:35.609 --> 18:37.229
I'm sorry.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.329
What?

18:39.849 --> 18:41.849
I'm sorry.

18:55.450 --> 18:57.450
Probably just the hose.

20:32.975 --> 20:34.975
What is it?

20:40.776 --> 20:43.616
Hey! Come look at this.

20:44.336 --> 20:46.396
What?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.496
Just come here!

20:49.056 --> 20:51.056
Look at this! Come here!

21:22.698 --> 21:24.698
If it burns black,
it ain't gold.

21:57.940 --> 21:59.940
That's fucking gold.

22:17.981 --> 22:21.341
Alright. Come over here.

22:21.701 --> 22:23.561
Let's go.

22:23.661 --> 22:25.481
Alright, help me here, again.

22:25.581 --> 22:27.582
Wiggle out this thing.

22:27.982 --> 22:29.922
OK.

22:30.022 --> 22:32.022
Ready? One…

22:33.062 --> 22:35.502
Two… Three…

22:50.183 --> 22:51.443
How do we do this?

22:51.543 --> 22:53.123
Ah…

22:55.063 --> 22:57.063
I don't know.

22:58.303 --> 23:00.303
We're getting the fucking thing
out.

23:02.984 --> 23:04.984
OK.

23:22.185 --> 23:24.245
Rope it again.

23:29.945 --> 23:31.285
OK.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.726
Fuck it!

23:46.826 --> 23:48.966
It didn't move at all.

23:49.066 --> 23:50.766
Fuck!

23:58.147 --> 24:00.327
Fuckin' piece of shit!

24:58.830 --> 25:01.830
Well, better get us
some firewood before sundown.

25:03.150 --> 25:05.150
Keep those damn dogs away.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.330
What dogs?

25:09.430 --> 25:12.831
They got their eye on us now,
but with a good fire burning…

25:14.231 --> 25:16.231
they won't bother us.

25:28.592 --> 25:30.592
Come on.

26:20.794 --> 26:23.034
Well, I guess I ain't taking
you to the compound no more?

26:23.515 --> 26:25.515
You gonna head back west now?

26:26.475 --> 26:28.475
I guess not.

26:30.195 --> 26:33.195
Yeah. Never much worth
in what we leave behind.

26:39.915 --> 26:41.916
Goddammit!

26:43.876 --> 26:45.876
You just found a fuckin' pile
of gold.

26:46.956 --> 26:49.416
Yee-hah!

26:49.516 --> 26:51.516
We just found
a fucking pile of gold!

26:52.276 --> 26:54.576
We just found a fucking pile
of gold! Come on, man!

26:54.676 --> 26:57.076
Get up! When does this ever
fuckin' happen?

26:57.596 --> 26:59.537
Yee-hahahaha!

26:59.637 --> 27:02.297
What are the odds, man?
What are the odds?

27:02.397 --> 27:04.597
Woo!

27:05.397 --> 27:06.937
Oh!

27:33.438 --> 27:37.439
Well, one of us will have to get
the excavator to get it out.

27:45.639 --> 27:47.639
Why one of us?

27:48.479 --> 27:50.760
One of us will have to stay here
with the gold, obviously.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.740
Protect it.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
Of course, yeah.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.620
I know a place
a couple of days drive east

28:00.720 --> 28:02.720
that'll have what we need.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.680
Two days there, two days back,
one sorting an excavator.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.380
Five days?

28:11.480 --> 28:13.941
Well, maybe four,
but you'll have to keep stopping

28:14.041 --> 28:16.041
to cool down the engine.

28:18.001 --> 28:20.001
You'll have to be careful
asking around.

28:20.841 --> 28:22.781
People get wind of you
needing an excavator,

28:22.881 --> 28:24.881
they're likely to want to know
why.

28:31.882 --> 28:33.882
I'll give you the name
of someone I trust

28:37.682 --> 28:39.682
and I'll stay here
with the gold.

28:46.082 --> 28:48.083
Why don't I stay here
with the gold?

28:51.003 --> 28:53.003
You know where to get
the excavator.

29:07.724 --> 29:09.064
I'm gonna say something here,

29:09.164 --> 29:12.964
and uh, I don't want you to take
it the wrong way or nothing,

29:16.284 --> 29:20.084
but I don't trust you to keep
your head while I'm gone.

29:24.004 --> 29:26.245
I don't mean to talk down to you
or nothing, but,

29:27.005 --> 29:29.005
you gotta watch your water.

29:29.405 --> 29:31.405
How much you drink,
how much you got left.

29:31.765 --> 29:33.665
You gotta stay out of the sun.

29:33.765 --> 29:35.885
Watch your food. If you run out,
you gotta catch more.

29:35.925 --> 29:37.925
It ain't no fucking joke
out here.

29:39.605 --> 29:42.045
You're a bit loose with it all,
not being from here, you know?

29:43.326 --> 29:45.326
I think I can handle it.

29:45.966 --> 29:48.426
Well, like I said, I don't mean
to condescend you or nothing,

29:48.526 --> 29:50.526
but,

29:51.446 --> 29:53.646
you may feel pretty safe with me
here right now, but,

29:55.206 --> 29:56.746
once I'm gone with the truck

29:56.846 --> 29:58.846
and you're here
all by your lonesome,

30:00.046 --> 30:02.047
be a very different feeling
indeed.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.887
You're likely to panic.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.187
Do something stupid.

30:10.287 --> 30:12.287
And then what?

30:13.567 --> 30:15.143
There's fuck all people
coming through here,

30:15.167 --> 30:17.167
but if someone does,

30:19.288 --> 30:21.584
they're not likely to want us
to keep the gold for ourselves,

30:21.608 --> 30:23.608
if you know what I mean?

30:25.728 --> 30:27.728
And I just don't think
you have it in you

30:28.088 --> 30:30.088
to stop that from happening.

30:32.368 --> 30:34.368
And I do not want to risk
what we got here.

30:38.889 --> 30:40.889
No offence.

30:45.729 --> 30:47.729
I think I'll stay with the gold.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.890
You sure?

31:05.890 --> 31:07.890
I'm sure.

31:23.851 --> 31:25.151
I got more water

31:25.251 --> 31:28.651
'cause I've gotta put it in the
truck to keep the engine cool.

31:31.852 --> 31:33.852
It is what it is.

31:35.572 --> 31:37.572
It is what it is.

31:39.292 --> 31:41.752
You got a few cans
of food there,

31:41.852 --> 31:44.972
but if run out,
you might want this.

31:46.332 --> 31:50.013
You see something,
don't be afraid, you use it.

31:58.413 --> 32:01.653
Now, keep this sat phone on you.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.153
Spare batteries.

32:05.253 --> 32:08.834
And I'll try and call you from
a payphone on the way there.

32:08.934 --> 32:12.874
But I'm going to try and buy one
when I get to the excavator.

32:12.974 --> 32:16.334
Then I can call you on the way
back without stopping.

32:17.214 --> 32:20.174
OK.

32:25.894 --> 32:27.895
It'll be OK.

32:28.815 --> 32:32.255
You just do what I said and…
keep your head on.

32:39.455 --> 32:44.235
Just think, by the time I get
back, we'll be rich as all hell.

35:38.065 --> 35:40.065
Oh, no, no, no.

35:51.706 --> 35:53.706
Go away.

39:27.558 --> 39:29.558
Oh, no.

39:30.638 --> 39:32.638
Fuck.

47:44.265 --> 47:46.265
Look at you.

47:50.585 --> 47:52.785
Crawling over a massive…

47:54.506 --> 47:57.546
Massive chunk of gold.

47:58.026 --> 48:00.026
For your whole life.

48:01.986 --> 48:03.986
You don't even know it.

48:14.227 --> 48:16.227
You can stay here.

49:40.431 --> 49:42.131
Hey.

49:42.231 --> 49:44.212
Got some bad news, I'm afraid.

49:44.312 --> 49:46.892
I'm at the weigh station,
and the engine's overheated.

49:46.992 --> 49:48.992
Shit!

49:50.072 --> 49:51.692
I'm moving as fast as I can,

49:51.792 --> 49:53.792
but this could take longer.

49:55.752 --> 49:57.752
I broke off a chunk of the gold.

49:58.792 --> 50:00.792
It's a decent size.

50:01.913 --> 50:03.913
Chunk?

50:04.393 --> 50:06.453
Don't even think about it.

50:06.553 --> 50:08.673
You had something like this
landed in your lap before?

50:09.713 --> 50:10.613
No.

50:10.713 --> 50:13.793
- Want to risk losing it?
- No.

50:14.153 --> 50:16.153
Stay with the gold.

50:17.153 --> 50:18.493
I'll be there as soon as I can.

50:18.593 --> 50:20.374
We'll have more
than just a chunk.

50:20.474 --> 50:22.474
We'll have it all.

50:24.234 --> 50:26.234
OK.

53:54.405 --> 53:58.786
Oh, no.

53:58.886 --> 54:00.886
Oh, fuck. God. Fuck.

54:01.886 --> 54:03.886
Fuck!

54:05.446 --> 54:08.126
Stupid fuck.

54:11.926 --> 54:14.926
Fuck.

56:29.854 --> 56:32.094
You hiding?

56:36.534 --> 56:38.534
Are you coming out, then?

57:09.856 --> 57:12.056
Are you scavenging?

57:14.976 --> 57:18.137
- Yep.
- To take where?

57:20.457 --> 57:24.337
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere?

57:25.577 --> 57:27.577
Right.

57:32.257 --> 57:34.437
Dried snake?

57:34.537 --> 57:38.738
- No.
- Go On. They won't bite.

57:39.498 --> 57:41.498
I said no.

57:47.338 --> 57:49.418
Sláinte.

58:04.739 --> 58:06.739
So you're out here on your own?

58:09.979 --> 58:11.979
I was.

58:13.420 --> 58:15.420
Why here?

58:20.300 --> 58:22.300
It's as good as place as any.

58:23.380 --> 58:25.040
Well, that's a load of bollocks,

58:25.140 --> 58:29.520
'cause about 5km that way,
there's actually a waterhole.

58:29.620 --> 58:31.621
More shelter.

58:32.101 --> 58:34.101
I like it just fine here.

58:35.261 --> 58:37.261
Then where are you taking that?

58:44.621 --> 58:46.621
Nervous little fucker,
aren't you?

59:14.863 --> 59:17.263
Wait. Wait!

59:18.583 --> 59:21.723
I see you got another camp
that way over there.

59:21.823 --> 59:22.923
Stop. Stop.

59:23.023 --> 59:25.784
Listen. I'm burning waste,
that's all.

59:26.384 --> 59:28.544
OK, I can see the smoke.

59:29.344 --> 59:32.844
You…you shouldn't shit
in your own backyard.

59:32.944 --> 59:37.024
Oh, oh, that…that's smart.

59:37.984 --> 59:40.144
Nothin' worse than
the smell of shite in the sun.

59:43.184 --> 59:45.185
Wait.

59:45.825 --> 59:50.005
Tell me, will you mind

59:50.105 --> 59:53.465
if I commandeer your little
shite fire over there?

59:56.305 --> 59:58.705
Just take the plane.

59:59.385 --> 1:00:01.005
It's the best shelter.

1:00:01.105 --> 1:00:03.106
You can build a fire.

1:00:05.346 --> 1:00:07.346
I'll leave you to it.

1:00:23.867 --> 1:00:26.187
You running from something?

1:00:26.907 --> 1:00:28.907
No.

1:00:29.947 --> 1:00:31.947
You hiding from the law?

1:00:33.507 --> 1:00:35.487
No.

1:00:35.587 --> 1:00:37.868
Well, I bet you're
from the north.

1:00:40.068 --> 1:00:42.188
How'd you say you got here?

1:00:43.468 --> 1:00:45.468
I didn't.

1:00:45.908 --> 1:00:47.908
Where are you going?

1:00:48.668 --> 1:00:50.668
To the compound.

1:00:51.388 --> 1:00:53.388
And how are you getting there?

1:00:55.268 --> 1:00:57.509
- A friend.
- Friend?

1:00:58.109 --> 1:01:00.109
So where is this friend?

1:01:01.029 --> 1:01:04.269
Passing through
and picking me up on the way.

1:01:05.309 --> 1:01:08.109
But how did you get here, then?
Hm?

1:01:09.069 --> 1:01:12.269
I'm a little deaf in this ear,
you'll have to speak up.

1:01:12.909 --> 1:01:15.050
Listen, lady.

1:01:15.150 --> 1:01:16.730
My friend is coming through,

1:01:16.830 --> 1:01:18.590
and he's picking me up on the
way, that's it.

1:01:18.670 --> 1:01:21.210
There's nothing more to it.

1:01:21.310 --> 1:01:23.890
OK? Fuck off.

1:01:23.990 --> 1:01:26.470
I offered you shelter. Take it.

1:01:30.950 --> 1:01:32.951
I think you're lying.

1:01:39.751 --> 1:01:43.591
Got a headache, huh? Have you?

1:01:44.551 --> 1:01:47.831
The brain gets dehydrated
out here.

1:01:48.791 --> 1:01:51.532
Sooner or later, it'll be
nothing but a dried up sponge

1:01:51.632 --> 1:01:54.432
bouncing around in your skull.

1:01:56.112 --> 1:01:58.592
Things start to get real
strange then.

1:02:01.472 --> 1:02:03.472
Hallucinations, even.

1:02:05.512 --> 1:02:07.992
You should rest, you should take
your shoes off.

1:02:08.472 --> 1:02:10.473
Take it easy, breathe.

1:02:11.793 --> 1:02:13.793
That's it.

1:02:15.353 --> 1:02:17.353
Just rest.

1:02:28.914 --> 1:02:31.014
Hey.

1:02:31.114 --> 1:02:33.274
Hey. Hey!

1:02:35.034 --> 1:02:37.034
Wait!

1:02:38.714 --> 1:02:40.754
Hey!

1:02:43.754 --> 1:02:45.755
Nice little camp you got here.

1:02:47.195 --> 1:02:49.055
You didn't want to share, huh?

1:02:52.915 --> 1:02:55.715
Pitched yourself a 5-star hotel,
have ya?

1:02:56.675 --> 1:02:58.775
And look at this fuckin' knot.

1:02:58.875 --> 1:03:00.875
Get the fuck outta here!

1:03:02.595 --> 1:03:04.596
Leave it!

1:03:10.476 --> 1:03:13.476
So, how did you get here,
anyway, hm?

1:03:14.756 --> 1:03:16.756
Did you walk?

1:03:17.356 --> 1:03:19.356
Camel?

1:03:19.716 --> 1:03:21.717
Magic carpet, maybe?

1:03:23.277 --> 1:03:25.277
You need to leave.

1:03:27.157 --> 1:03:29.317
Well, I think
you're hidin' somethin'.

1:03:33.797 --> 1:03:36.077
You're a lyin' little swine.

1:03:39.037 --> 1:03:42.058
I think you came through here
with someone,

1:03:42.158 --> 1:03:43.858
and hatched a wee plan.

1:03:43.958 --> 1:03:46.818
A bunch of greedy little pigs.

1:03:46.918 --> 1:03:48.498
You think you can come out here

1:03:48.598 --> 1:03:50.898
'cause your fucked-up city
turned on itself,

1:03:50.998 --> 1:03:52.998
and take what isn't yours?

1:03:53.758 --> 1:03:58.459
No, you people are a virus
and you want me to leave.

1:03:58.559 --> 1:04:00.899
Well, fuck you, city boy!

1:04:00.999 --> 1:04:02.059
Now, why don't you…?

1:06:12.126 --> 1:06:13.306
Hey!

1:06:13.406 --> 1:06:15.746
Hey, yeah, fuck, get the fuck…!

1:06:15.846 --> 1:06:17.846
Fuckin'…

1:07:46.691 --> 1:07:48.671
Get! Get!

1:07:49.971 --> 1:07:51.351
Get!

1:09:39.137 --> 1:09:41.117
Hello?

1:09:42.457 --> 1:09:43.998
You with the gold?

1:09:44.098 --> 1:09:46.098
Where are you?

1:09:48.698 --> 1:09:50.698
Nearly here?

1:09:51.058 --> 1:09:52.958
I got the excavator now

1:09:53.058 --> 1:09:55.058
the goddamn thing's
slowing me down.

1:10:03.699 --> 1:10:05.699
You there?

1:10:08.699 --> 1:10:10.559
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1:10:10.659 --> 1:10:11.919
OK, listen.

1:10:12.019 --> 1:10:13.519
I can make up some time,

1:10:13.619 --> 1:10:15.619
but it still may take longer
than I planned.

1:10:21.860 --> 1:10:23.860
You there?

1:10:26.540 --> 1:10:28.600
Yeah, I'm here.

1:10:28.700 --> 1:10:30.840
I got a phone now
that you can call me on.

1:10:30.940 --> 1:10:33.980
Call me on this number
if you need anything.

1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:37.300
Stay strong.

1:10:38.701 --> 1:10:43.101
Listen, like I said, just keep
your head on. You'll be fine.

1:10:44.701 --> 1:10:46.701
I'm goin' as fast as I can.

1:10:47.901 --> 1:10:50.081
You OK?

1:10:50.181 --> 1:10:51.801
How long until…?

1:10:51.901 --> 1:10:53.901
How much longer…?

1:10:55.341 --> 1:10:57.522
How long until you fix the hose?

1:10:57.622 --> 1:10:59.622
What hose?

1:11:00.142 --> 1:11:01.642
The hose.

1:11:01.742 --> 1:11:03.742
I fixed it before I left.

1:11:05.982 --> 1:11:07.982
You sure you're OK?

1:11:11.782 --> 1:11:13.782
Can you hear me?

1:11:15.183 --> 1:11:17.183
How's your water?

1:11:17.623 --> 1:11:19.623
You have enough to eat?

1:13:27.809 --> 1:13:28.909
Oh, fuck.

1:19:52.451 --> 1:19:54.451
Thirsty?

1:19:54.971 --> 1:19:56.971
Go on.

1:19:58.811 --> 1:20:00.811
Take it.

1:20:02.572 --> 1:20:04.632
That's enough, that's enough.

1:20:15.572 --> 1:20:17.572
Got a headache, huh?

1:20:18.572 --> 1:20:20.933
Things start to get
real strange then.

1:22:00.378 --> 1:22:02.378
Hello.

1:22:04.258 --> 1:22:05.758
- Hello.
- Hey, can you hear me?

1:22:05.858 --> 1:22:09.119
I can't see her.
I can't see her.

1:22:09.219 --> 1:22:11.819
What are you talking about?
Who else is there?

1:22:14.339 --> 1:22:16.039
She's all over the place.

1:22:16.139 --> 1:22:18.499
Is someone else there?
Who is she?

1:22:19.939 --> 1:22:21.939
Does she know about the gold?

1:22:23.419 --> 1:22:25.419
Has she seen the gold?

1:22:26.179 --> 1:22:28.180
No.

1:22:28.620 --> 1:22:30.620
You gotta get rid of her, OK?

1:22:31.100 --> 1:22:33.100
OK?

1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:39.860
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK, good.

1:22:41.020 --> 1:22:44.220
Do whatever you gotta do.
You understand?

1:22:47.261 --> 1:22:49.981
You there? Can you hear me?

1:22:51.341 --> 1:22:53.341
Fuckin' get rid of her!

1:22:57.541 --> 1:22:59.681
You there?

1:22:59.781 --> 1:23:01.781
Can you hear me?

1:23:05.462 --> 1:23:07.442
OK.

1:23:07.542 --> 1:23:09.542
OK.

1:23:10.382 --> 1:23:12.382
You hungry?

1:23:41.464 --> 1:23:43.464
You're not hungry?

1:23:46.544 --> 1:23:48.544
No.

1:23:51.544 --> 1:23:53.984
Let me fix you some food.

1:23:55.104 --> 1:23:57.104
Did you not hear me?

1:23:57.904 --> 1:23:59.905
I said no.

1:24:05.465 --> 1:24:07.285
Listen, there's a waterhole.

1:24:07.385 --> 1:24:09.725
I can walk you there.

1:24:09.825 --> 1:24:11.825
Go.

1:24:15.025 --> 1:24:17.026
You'll die if you don't.

1:24:20.066 --> 1:24:22.066
Go!

1:24:25.106 --> 1:24:27.106
So, you didn't see my sister?

1:24:31.626 --> 1:24:33.626
Go.

1:25:44.190 --> 1:25:46.190
- Did you get rid of her?
- Yeah.

1:25:47.070 --> 1:25:48.171
Yeah.

1:25:48.271 --> 1:25:50.411
- Where are you?
- I'm close.

1:25:50.511 --> 1:25:53.411
- How close?
- I can see smoke.

1:25:53.511 --> 1:25:54.691
Is that you?

1:25:54.791 --> 1:25:56.831
Yeah. Yeah.

1:25:58.631 --> 1:26:00.831
Yeah. That's me.

1:26:05.031 --> 1:26:06.892
Get the fuck outta here!

1:26:23.792 --> 1:26:25.793
You need to hurry.

1:26:26.113 --> 1:26:28.113
You need to hurry.

1:26:33.473 --> 1:26:34.933
Get the fuck outta here!

1:26:46.634 --> 1:26:47.734
Get off!

1:26:47.834 --> 1:26:49.834
I said get the fuck outta here!

1:26:59.354 --> 1:27:01.355
Fuck off!

1:27:13.595 --> 1:27:15.595
Where are you?

1:27:20.516 --> 1:27:22.516
Hello?

1:27:23.236 --> 1:27:25.236
Can you see the smoke?

1:27:27.436 --> 1:27:29.456
Can you hear me?

1:27:29.556 --> 1:27:31.556
Hello.

1:27:31.876 --> 1:27:33.656
Where are you?

1:27:33.756 --> 1:27:36.456
I did my part, I protected it!

1:27:41.477 --> 1:27:43.417
You useless prick!

1:27:43.517 --> 1:27:46.037
I found it! It's mine!
