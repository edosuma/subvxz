And the bad?

00:36.170 --> 00:39.921
According to the surveyors,
the only viable way
is across Glenbogle land.

I wanted to talk to
you about it.

02:04.122 --> 02:07.498
I've agreed to build
an access road
to bypass the village.

It seems only fair
to the locals,
I'm sure you agree.

02:10.167 --> 02:15.127

done, and the shortest route
runs from here to here.

I know you two didn't get off
on the right foot. But...

Does it not strike
you as ironic that in order to
build her so-called "EcoDome",

03:20.694 --> 03:22.111
the first thing
she does is start

Well, maybe you'll get
a job in a city.

14:15.790 --> 14:18.082
I'm not exactly overqualified.

14:21.125 --> 14:24.585
Why did your parents
move up here
in the first place?

14:24.669 --> 14:27.295
They talked about it
for years,

14:27.378 --> 14:30.296
thought the fresh air
would be good for us.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.422
Anyway,

14:33.505 --> 14:36.172
I reckon they'd be gutted
if I moved back.

14:36.256 --> 14:38.549
-So, you're a good lad really?
-Aye!

14:41.924 --> 14:43.801
All right, I'm no angel...

14:45.218 --> 14:48.303
But I'm not what
they make me out
to be, either.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.804
What would you say
if I offered you a job?

14:54.013 --> 14:55.389
Okay, if you don't want it...

14:55.472 --> 14:57.348
Doing what?

14:57.432 --> 15:00.683
Well, I need someone
to help me run this place.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.392
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

15:02.475 --> 15:04.810
-For money?
-No, for lollipops.

15:04.893 --> 15:08.144
Yeah, course, for money!
Come on.

15:08.227 --> 15:10.770
We'll discuss it over lunch.

15:10.854 --> 15:12.896
Pasta, on a bed of toast.

16:00.373 --> 16:03.041
Right, lads, gather round
and give this man
a bit of respect.

16:12.670 --> 16:16.171
Aye-aye, Duncan,
so you're the boss!

16:16.254 --> 16:20.507
Oh, I wouldn't call me
the boss, Brendan!

16:20.590 --> 16:23.090
I mean, I don't want
you to think of me as...

16:26.008 --> 16:30.719
I... I mean,
it's not a them...
and us situation.

16:32.220 --> 16:33.220
Is it?

16:35.095 --> 16:38.472
No, I just
came down to
say that, er, I'm...

16:38.555 --> 16:43.307
I'm sure that
you're as excited
about this project

16:43.390 --> 16:47.934
as I am, and to remember
that it's not just a job,

16:48.017 --> 16:50.727
but that you're part
of a team.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.353
You're a cog...

16:54.144 --> 16:56.312
In a machine made of men.

17:00.022 --> 17:01.105
Any questions?

17:01.189 --> 17:03.565
Aye, where did
you get the suit?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.733
Now, I'm holding
a meeting in the village hall
tomorrow night

17:08.817 --> 17:12.653
to launch the EcoDome
project officially.
Will you be there?

17:12.736 --> 17:14.402
Yeah, I'll be there.

17:14.486 --> 17:17.655
Good. I'm still
a bit of a newcomer
when it comes to the locals.

17:17.738 --> 17:20.239
And It would be nice
to have someone
to hold my hand.

17:20.321 --> 17:22.948
Well, I did promise
your brother that
I'd look after you.

17:23.031 --> 17:25.074
I know. I'm so grateful.

17:26.449 --> 17:27.866
Oh,

17:27.950 --> 17:30.451
I don't suppose
you'd consider
chairing the meeting,

17:30.535 --> 17:32.702
as a prominent local figure?

17:33.410 --> 17:35.994
Um, yeah, why not?

17:36.078 --> 17:37.621
Of course it would
be really useful

17:37.704 --> 17:40.330
to know if I had your go-ahead
for the access road. But...

17:40.413 --> 17:44.039
I quite understand if you're
not allowed to make decisions
single-handed any more.

17:44.123 --> 17:46.914
-I can make whatever
decisions I like.
-Good.

17:47.707 --> 17:49.416
So, what do you say?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.292
Have we got a deal?

17:53.502 --> 17:55.544
Right, lads, let's do it!

17:57.127 --> 18:00.672
And the quicker
we get started,
the sooner we get away.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.137
Duncan...

18:18.303 --> 18:20.221
Let me explain something.

18:20.304 --> 18:22.514
We're no piece workers.

18:22.597 --> 18:24.973
We're paid by the hour,

18:25.056 --> 18:27.224
so how the hell would
we want to go away early?

18:34.268 --> 18:36.227
Does the word bonus
mean anything to you?

18:38.103 --> 18:39.145
That'll do for me!

18:42.272 --> 18:43.689
I cannot believe you did that!

18:43.771 --> 18:45.772
After everything that I said!

18:45.856 --> 18:49.065
Look, I was only acting in
the best interests of
the village and Glenbogle.

18:49.149 --> 18:53.401
Well, you've linked
the Glenbogle name
to Dorothy Trumpington-Bonnet!

18:53.484 --> 18:56.860
-So, let's just hope
that you're right.
-Bad moment?

18:56.943 --> 19:01.737
No, no, Paul, come in!
Archie's got some great news!

19:01.820 --> 19:04.363

redevelop your site!

19:04.447 --> 19:06.156
PAUL: What?

19:06.239 --> 19:08.740
(SCOFFS) I knew you weren't
that interested in
the activity centre,

19:08.823 --> 19:10.324
but to run a road
through it...

19:10.408 --> 19:12.451
Come on, now Paul,
Arch wouldn't be that petty.

19:12.534 --> 19:15.410
Like it or not,
Dorothy is here to stay,

19:15.493 --> 19:17.286
so we might as well
work with her.

19:17.369 --> 19:19.995
We've got plenty of land
to move the activity centre
wherever we want!

19:20.078 --> 19:23.121
No, you're missing the point.
We're supposed to be partners,

19:23.204 --> 19:25.289
but you couldn't even
be bothered to consult me!

19:25.372 --> 19:28.956
Um, I think I'll leave
you two boys to sort out
your differences.

19:33.167 --> 19:36.585
-What are you doing here?
-I'm Paul's new assistant.

19:43.337 --> 19:45.213
Wait for me by
the assault course, will you?

19:51.840 --> 19:54.258
ARCHIE: What a hypocrite!
I cannot believe that

19:54.341 --> 19:57.052
you have the nerve to give me
a hard time over Dorothy,

19:57.135 --> 19:59.553
when you go and hire people
without even asking me!

20:01.678 --> 20:05.888
Bye. Bye.
Sorry about that, lads,

to offer any bonuses just now.

20:09.931 --> 20:14.892
However, the good news
is that the EcoDome will prove

20:14.975 --> 20:17.101
a bonus to the whole area.

20:19.852 --> 20:24.312
-Right then, let's get on
with some work.
-Yeah, lads, back to work.

Thanks for backing
me up with Paul.

I defended you
as much as I could,

I'm sorry, you're in the wrong
over this Dorothy thing.

to keep personal feelings

in this estate without me.

that Duncan's gone?

you be looking for?

31:06.027 --> 31:07.028
Kiss, kiss, Tiger.

31:14.197 --> 31:15.698
Good meeting?

31:15.781 --> 31:17.949
Ah, you know, networking,

31:19.574 --> 31:22.701
bit of strategic
brainstorming...

31:22.784 --> 31:26.077
You're very sexy when you go
all alpha male on me.

31:33.788 --> 31:35.622
A... Actually...

31:35.706 --> 31:38.999
It's been a long day.
I think I'll turn in.

31:39.916 --> 31:41.917
You read my mind.

31:43.709 --> 31:46.919
Uh, why don't you go on ahead?

31:47.003 --> 31:49.128
And I'll be up in a minute.

32:06.551 --> 32:09.636
That's an hors d'oeuvres.
Don't be long.

-(GASPS)
-What you doing here?

32:21.473 --> 32:25.726
-I'm sorry, but I just had...
-No, actually, forget it.
There isn't time.

32:25.809 --> 32:29.769
"You're very sexy
when you go
all alpha male on me!"

32:29.853 --> 32:32.812
-Oh, just hurry up.
-HERMIONE: Duncan!

32:32.895 --> 32:35.646
-Oh!
-All right.
Steady on... Tiger.

32:50.944 --> 32:52.486
I've locked up.

32:53.445 --> 32:54.779
Get in!

33:00.948 --> 33:02.699
Oh, there you are.

33:03.616 --> 33:04.950
What are you doing?

33:07.451 --> 33:12.037
Nothing...
I was just about
to come up, too.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.412
Well, in that case...

-Morning.
-Morning.

35:08.332 --> 35:10.375
I'm sorry I took the gun.

35:10.458 --> 35:13.126
Ah, let's just put
that behind us, eh?

35:13.876 --> 35:14.919
Okay.

35:15.002 --> 35:17.294
So, what do you want me to do?

35:19.045 --> 35:20.963
GOLLY: Come in.

35:21.046 --> 35:23.380
He's early.
That's a good start.

35:24.881 --> 35:26.715
-EWAN: Morning.
-Aye.

35:26.799 --> 35:28.674
-Morning.
-Hi.

35:28.757 --> 35:32.341
Ewan is gonna trail us today.
I promised Paul
I'd try him out.

35:32.425 --> 35:34.718
I heard there was
a head ranger's job
up for grabs.

35:46.472 --> 35:48.973
I was thinking about
what you said.

35:49.599 --> 35:51.474
You're right.

35:51.557 --> 35:54.518
The locals do look to me,
to all of us,

35:54.601 --> 35:56.476
to do the right thing.

35:57.351 --> 36:00.770
So, what are you saying?

36:00.854 --> 36:04.355
Well, I was hoping that we
could maybe present a united
front at this meeting tonight.

36:06.272 --> 36:07.898
You want me to back off?

36:09.399 --> 36:11.398
I think we should
look beyond this thing.
Yeah?

36:17.986 --> 36:21.028
There you go.

36:21.111 --> 36:24.530
Just remember what I said,
you take a deep breath,
you hold it and then

36:24.613 --> 36:27.197
just gently squeeze
the trigger.

36:27.281 --> 36:29.866
I'll get your safety
off for you.

36:29.949 --> 36:31.658
Okay. Away you go.

(STUTTERS)
That's not bad, son.

36:54.292 --> 36:57.626
Maybe just next time,
try and keep your eyes open.

36:58.793 --> 37:00.627
Do you mind taking over, Jess?

37:00.711 --> 37:02.545
Still want me
to take up teaching?

37:02.628 --> 37:05.296
Well, I thought you might
pass on what you've learned
about fly-fishing

37:05.379 --> 37:08.589
and get a wee bit of
extra practise
in with the lad.

37:08.672 --> 37:12.132
Right, so I'm off to bag
those rabbits
I promised to Lex...

37:12.215 --> 37:13.924
Put that gun down!

37:19.427 --> 37:21.469
Never, ever point
a gun at anyone!

37:22.094 --> 37:23.136
Sorry.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.555
-All right?
-Aye, fine.

37:31.015 --> 37:32.348

37:55.900 --> 37:58.150
What's this?
No suit?

37:58.233 --> 38:00.610
Nah! I thought this would
be a safer bet.

38:00.693 --> 38:03.861
-I didn't think you'd be back.
-Oh, India rubber, me.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.154
You all right, lads?

38:09.029 --> 38:11.615
Any more initiation rites?
Or will we

38:11.698 --> 38:15.574
pretend to be grown-ups
and, you know,
actually do some work?

38:20.409 --> 38:23.118
Fair enough.
Right, lads, back to work.

38:35.874 --> 38:37.583
-Down at last.
-Oh!

38:40.834 --> 38:42.794
It must have been
a heavy night.

It was.

fluid movement
you're after.

you can do, then.
-Look and learn.

39:34.731 --> 39:37.357
we'll just un-snag this,

39:37.440 --> 39:40.233
and we'll have another go.

39:40.316 --> 39:43.109
-Right, you ready?
-Ladies first.

40:05.785 --> 40:08.744
Surely you're not gonna let
a girl beat you?

40:08.828 --> 40:10.161
I didn't break in.

40:10.245 --> 40:12.246
The door was unlocked.

40:12.329 --> 40:15.163
Well, I think you'll find
in the eyes of the law,
that is technically burglary.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.707
Have you completely
lost your senses?

40:16.790 --> 40:18.873
She is up to something,
Archie.

40:18.956 --> 40:21.040
You just can't let it go,
can you?

40:21.124 --> 40:23.000
Did your new best friend

40:23.083 --> 40:27.294
happen to tell you
that without your access road,
there's no EcoDome?

40:28.085 --> 40:29.586
-No, but...
-A-ha!

40:29.670 --> 40:32.170
A-ha, nothing.

40:32.254 --> 40:36.130
Have you any proof
at all that she's been
up to no good?

40:36.213 --> 40:37.214
No.

40:38.298 --> 40:39.299
A-ha.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.759
Aye, aye.

40:46.802 --> 40:48.677
So, how did it go with Ewan?

40:48.760 --> 40:51.469
Yeah, he's a nice kid.
Tried really hard but,

40:51.554 --> 40:54.221
to be honest,
I wouldn't think he was
a natural head ranger.

40:54.305 --> 40:56.471
No? Okay, well,
I'll let Paul know.

40:56.556 --> 40:58.764
-Not that, that'll stop
you both from taking him on.
-What?

40:58.848 --> 41:00.765
Well, he is the right sex.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.433
-Now, just wait a wee minute.
-I know I'm only here
for a while,

41:03.516 --> 41:05.642
but it's not just the job.

41:05.726 --> 41:08.018
Okay, the money would
have been nice, but

41:08.101 --> 41:13.270
the thing that really gets me
is I can't believe my own dad
could be so insensitive!

41:14.396 --> 41:16.313
How have I been insensitive?

41:16.396 --> 41:19.356
-If you don't know...
-Just tell me, lass.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.733
All I wanted
was a bit of recognition,

41:23.774 --> 41:24.817
a word,

41:24.900 --> 41:26.150
a smile,

41:26.233 --> 41:27.776
a sign

41:27.860 --> 41:31.485
that you had noticed
how hard I was trying
to impress you.

41:35.446 --> 41:38.572
The only reason
I took up land management
was after I met you

41:38.655 --> 41:39.989
for the first time.

41:43.699 --> 41:45.116
I didn't know that.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.869
I just wanted to make
you proud of me.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.870
How stupid was that.

41:56.663 --> 41:57.788
Jess.

42:22.215 --> 42:24.382
Duncan! I need to talk to you.

42:24.466 --> 42:27.008
-Lexie, I told you last...
-Look, no, no, no!
Just hear me out.

42:27.091 --> 42:29.884
-Okay.
-I found a file last night.

42:29.967 --> 42:32.594
-Lexie...
-No, I think it's important.

42:32.677 --> 42:34.011
I've got to get on.
I'm sorry...

42:34.094 --> 42:35.803
I've also just had
a phone call...

42:35.886 --> 42:38.387
From a hotel...
In Glasgow.

43:12.401 --> 43:15.486
-No Lexie?
-She'll probably meet
us down there.

43:17.612 --> 43:19.655
-Glad I caught you.
-Oh, not another accident?

43:19.738 --> 43:21.614
No, nothing like that.

43:22.197 --> 43:23.614
It's just...

43:23.697 --> 43:26.073
Well, I wanted to thank you
both for giving me a chance,

43:26.156 --> 43:30.033
but I'm just not cut out
to be a head ranger.

43:30.116 --> 43:33.909
-I'm... Um, sorry
to hear that.
-Ah, well...

43:33.993 --> 43:36.828
I suppose it's good to know
your weaknesses as well
as your strengths.

43:36.911 --> 43:38.787
You'll find a job soon.

43:40.454 --> 43:42.455
Well, I'd better be off.
Soon be dinner time.

43:43.789 --> 43:46.666
Ah, that reminds me...

43:46.749 --> 43:48.791
Isn't it your turn
to cook tonight?

43:48.873 --> 43:53.000
Oh, yeah completely forgot.
Have to rustle up
something when I get back.

43:53.084 --> 43:54.544
Looks like someone's
going hungry.

43:54.627 --> 43:56.670
-See you.
-Watch it, you!

44:13.342 --> 44:15.677
Duncan.
You're not even changed.

44:17.511 --> 44:19.262
What?

44:19.345 --> 44:21.136
I know about the hotel job.

44:22.638 --> 44:23.972
What are you talking about?

44:24.055 --> 44:26.264
(EXHALES)
You opened the letter.

44:26.347 --> 44:28.056
The job was mine.
You told me I didn't get it,

44:28.140 --> 44:30.599
and they gave it
to somebody else.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.434
I trusted you, Hermione.
How could you do that?

44:37.519 --> 44:40.061
It was only a job.

44:40.145 --> 44:41.979
That's okay for you to say.

44:42.062 --> 44:43.646
You'll never be stuck for work

44:43.729 --> 44:45.772
as long as you've got
your mummy to bail you out.

44:45.855 --> 44:49.065
In case you hadn't noticed,
you're doing all right,
thanks to her.

44:49.149 --> 44:51.858
You knew how much
I wanted that job!

44:51.941 --> 44:54.859
I couldn't stand
the idea of you
being so far away.

44:54.942 --> 45:00.653
-Oh, it was only Glasgow!
-I thought you'd be happier
here with me!

45:00.736 --> 45:04.155
No, Hermione, don't pretend
that you were thinking about
what was best for me.

45:04.238 --> 45:05.697
You lied to me.

45:07.614 --> 45:09.657
Where are you going?

45:09.740 --> 45:12.866
The meeting, of course.
I wouldn't miss
that for the world.

45:13.907 --> 45:15.200
And then?

45:17.535 --> 45:20.453
Then I'll come back here
and start to pack.

45:21.244 --> 45:22.579
Duncan...

45:22.662 --> 45:25.912
Sorry, Hermione.
I just can't trust
you any more.

MAN: (ON TELEVISION)
Had that happened
a week or two from now...

45:35.958 --> 45:38.293
Are you hungry, lass?

45:38.376 --> 45:41.919
Hmm? I've got a pot
of hot homemade soup there.

45:42.878 --> 45:44.171
Whatever.

45:45.962 --> 45:48.922
(SIGHS) Would you mind
just switching that off
for a minute?

46:01.511 --> 46:02.678
I'm...

46:03.636 --> 46:05.679
I'm sorry if I upset you.

46:06.262 --> 46:07.513
I know.

46:08.888 --> 46:10.805
I just wanted you
to take me seriously.

46:10.889 --> 46:13.599
And I just wanted you to know
what this job is really like.

46:15.099 --> 46:16.476
So tell me.

46:17.517 --> 46:20.310
Well, um...

46:20.393 --> 46:24.187
Well, you can forget
about your social life
for a start.

46:24.270 --> 46:27.188
I can tell you that deer make
pretty lousy conversation.

46:29.647 --> 46:31.230
It's...

46:31.314 --> 46:34.149
A vocation, rather than a job.
You work...

46:34.232 --> 46:37.192
Very long hours
for very little thanks.

46:38.733 --> 46:41.735
The only reward you get
is knowing that the...

46:41.818 --> 46:44.153
That the land is
well looked after.

46:45.028 --> 46:46.488
But you love it.

46:48.571 --> 46:52.156
Imagine how I felt today
when you told me
you were trying Ewan out.

46:52.239 --> 46:55.240
Now, that was Paul.
He wanted to give
the boy another chance.

46:57.241 --> 46:59.493
You handled him well, though.

47:00.409 --> 47:02.035
-Did I?
-Oh, yes.

47:04.328 --> 47:07.162
Anyway, uh...
I've had a word
with Archie and...

47:08.704 --> 47:12.373
He's happy
for you to have
the head ranger job

47:12.456 --> 47:13.873
while you're here.

47:14.915 --> 47:16.332
And so am I.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.918
-Did you just say
what I thought you said?
-I did.

47:22.001 --> 47:24.044
Thanks, Dad!

47:38.049 --> 47:40.050

47:43.093 --> 47:46.177
-Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
-(PEOPLE MUMBLING)

47:46.260 --> 47:49.513
It's good to see such
a big turnout.

47:49.596 --> 47:54.139
Um, it has come to my,
or rather, our attention

47:54.223 --> 47:57.391
that all sorts of rumours
have been circulating um...

47:57.474 --> 48:01.058
Since work on
the EcoDome site began,

48:01.141 --> 48:03.976
so I'm gonna hand you
over to Lady Dorothy
Trumpington-Bonnet

48:04.060 --> 48:06.936
who I'm sure
will be more than happy
to answer any questions.

48:07.727 --> 48:08.727
(APPLAUSE)

48:12.105 --> 48:15.855
I'm very glad to be able
to address your concerns
head on,

48:15.939 --> 48:19.732
and I'm certain that by the
end of this evening, your
fears will have been allayed.

48:19.816 --> 48:22.401
Lights, please.
Hermione!

This is the future
of eco-tourism,

48:27.653 --> 48:31.363
a haven for naturalists
and holidaymakers alike,

48:31.446 --> 48:35.155
the EcoDome will put
the village of Glenbogle
on the map.

48:35.239 --> 48:38.698
-Never mind that, what do
we get out of it?
-ALL: Yeah!

48:38.781 --> 48:41.617
And what about all the traffic
and the mess?

48:41.700 --> 48:45.909
I think it'll be in all
our interests if we let
the speaker finish.

48:48.244 --> 48:50.661
This is the interface,

48:50.744 --> 48:54.539
where traditional
Highland heritage meets
the 21st century.

48:55.580 --> 48:56.831
In its first year,

48:56.914 --> 49:00.040
the EcoDome will create
150 new jobs,

49:00.124 --> 49:02.333
and bring a considerable
income to the area.

49:02.417 --> 49:04.418
(APPLAUSE)

49:09.044 --> 49:12.753
Excellent, excellent!
But...

49:12.837 --> 49:16.046
What about the second phase
of the development?

49:19.424 --> 49:23.632
What about the holiday village
and the self-catering
apartments,

49:23.716 --> 49:27.676
and the restaurants,
and the gym
and the swimming pools.

49:27.759 --> 49:30.261
These are just
theoretical drawings

49:30.344 --> 49:33.429
I've had made up
for possible consideration
in the future,

49:33.512 --> 49:36.263
and should it even happen,

49:36.347 --> 49:40.764
all local people would
be welcome to join
in the facilities.

49:40.848 --> 49:44.434
Yeah, that's very good,
but I don't think
that these local people

49:44.517 --> 49:46.476
could afford your facilities.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.852
I've already told you,
we'll be creating
a lot of new jobs.

49:49.935 --> 49:54.854
Actually, that's true,
Dorothy will be creating
a lot of new jobs,

49:54.937 --> 49:58.730
it's just that the bad news is
that none of them
are for you lot.

49:58.814 --> 50:03.816
This is a recruitment file
from a specialist company
in London.

50:03.899 --> 50:08.109
Dorothy is recruiting
from London and Europe.

50:09.569 --> 50:13.736
Well, anywhere really,
except for Glenbogle.

50:13.820 --> 50:15.154
MAN: That's outrageous!

50:15.237 --> 50:17.155
Is this true?

50:17.238 --> 50:19.573
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a malicious slander

50:19.655 --> 50:21.948
-cast by someone who has
just left my employment.
-(LEXIE SCOFFS)

50:22.032 --> 50:25.949
-Answer Duncan's point,
please.
-ALL: Yeah.

50:26.033 --> 50:28.200
Is this true?

50:28.284 --> 50:30.618
Well, I'll need trained,

50:30.701 --> 50:34.579
uh, resourceful,
energetic people
at the beginning.

50:34.661 --> 50:36.538
(AUDIENCE CLAPPING MOCKINGLY)

50:36.621 --> 50:40.080
And what about the road?
Is it true that you can't
proceed without it?

50:40.164 --> 50:43.206
Archie, this is neither
the time nor the place
to discuss this.

50:43.290 --> 50:46.292
Has there been
a grain of truth in anything
you've told me?

50:52.377 --> 50:54.211
Ladies and gentlemen,

50:55.711 --> 50:57.004
Paul was right.

50:57.087 --> 50:59.713
I was acting in what I thought

50:59.796 --> 51:02.589
was the best interest
of us all, but...

51:02.672 --> 51:06.841
In the light of this evening's
revelations, it seems
that I have been duped,

51:06.925 --> 51:11.134
and so I withdraw
my offer for your road
to cross my land.

51:12.469 --> 51:14.886
The deal is off.

51:14.969 --> 51:18.054
-PAUL: Bravo!
-(ALL CHEERING)

51:27.266 --> 51:30.142
Well done, Duncan!

51:30.226 --> 51:33.684
-You did the right thing,
Archie.
-Thank you very much.

51:33.769 --> 51:37.895
It takes a brave man
to admit he's wrong in public.

51:37.978 --> 51:39.438
Listen, Dunc,
I'm sorry about the...

51:39.521 --> 51:42.356
The relationship?
Career change?

51:44.023 --> 51:46.774
Well, it's given me
a lot to think about,
but you know,

51:46.857 --> 51:50.484
I reckon I'm just
the wrong shape for
a suit.

51:50.566 --> 51:54.027
So, you can call off
the search for
a new head ranger.

51:55.402 --> 51:56.736
I'm back!

51:57.778 --> 51:59.737
Sorry, mate, but...

51:59.820 --> 52:02.280
The position's already
been taken.

52:04.365 --> 52:09.574
-Of course, if I'd known
this was going to happen...
-No, no, I understand.

52:09.658 --> 52:11.909
You're welcome
to come back and have
your old room if you like.

52:11.992 --> 52:15.576
No, it's okay,
I... I... (STUTTERS)

52:18.328 --> 52:20.454
When were you planning
to tell me?

52:20.537 --> 52:23.579
Well, you know that
Jessica's the right person
for the job.

52:23.663 --> 52:25.456
Not the point, Arch.

52:27.499 --> 52:29.250
I know. I know.

52:36.961 --> 52:39.586
-I'm starving.
-Well, you'll have to wait.

52:39.670 --> 52:42.838
-What?
-Well, I didn't get a chance
to cook because of...

52:42.921 --> 52:44.672
What are you doing here?

52:44.755 --> 52:48.048
-And what's that smell?
-Have a little faith, eh?

52:57.427 --> 52:59.428
I don't believe this!

53:05.763 --> 53:07.431
Where did you learn
to cook like this?

53:07.514 --> 53:10.015
EWAN: It's amazing
what you can learn
from daytime telly!

53:10.099 --> 53:12.141
-When you've got nothing
better to do.
-(LAUGHING)

53:12.225 --> 53:14.934
-This is fantastic!
-Glad you like it.

53:15.017 --> 53:17.560
You know that Dougal's looking
to do more food at the pub?

53:17.643 --> 53:20.061
Wages and beer.
Can't be bad!

53:21.354 --> 53:22.812
Bon appetit.

53:28.231 --> 53:31.233
-Right!
-Let's get stuck in, then!

53:31.316 --> 53:33.275
