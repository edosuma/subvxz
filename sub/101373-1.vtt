-Jesus.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.421
When was the last time
you slept, Hugh?

14:39.462 --> 14:41.548
Head down. Head down. Sorry.

14:41.590 --> 14:46.094
I just... I'm wanted
and you're kind of super famous,

14:46.136 --> 14:48.972
so, uh...

14:49.014 --> 14:51.349
-Did you snap the SIM card? I...
-Yes. Uh, yes.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.934
I snapped the SIM card, okay?

14:52.976 --> 14:55.103
And no one followed me
down here,

14:55.145 --> 14:57.397
and they can't even trace
my chip down here.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.149
We're okay.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.032
You look good.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.909
Yeah, you, um...
you look good, too.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.163
You look very, you know, uh...

15:14.873 --> 15:16.708
Yeah, I'm lying. I'm sorry.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.002
-You look like shit.
-I know.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.254
I know.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.672
Where are you guys living?

15:24.966 --> 15:26.509
Club Med in Ibiza.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.511
It's been awesome.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.180
The foam parties will
change your life.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.389
Idiot.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.646
(laughs softly)

15:41.107 --> 15:45.278
Oh, um... here it is.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.660
STARLIGHT:
Oh, shit.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.414
I know him.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.416
-You do?
-Yeah.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.669
I mean, not for a while,

16:00.710 --> 16:03.421
but yes, from my
Capes for Christ days.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.634
Are you sure you can do this?

16:07.676 --> 16:09.636
I have a choice?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.813
Hey, I, uh...

16:19.854 --> 16:21.856
I saw a really great picture
of you

16:21.898 --> 16:24.442
at the Teen Choice Awards
with, um-- what's his name?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.237
Ansel Adams?

16:27.278 --> 16:31.199
Alden Ehrenreich.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.493
Are you stalking me
on Instagram?

16:33.535 --> 16:35.745
No. No, of course not.
Get over yourself.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.331
So did the PR people put you
together or what, what's...

16:38.373 --> 16:40.583
-No. He's a nice guy.
-He's an actor.

16:40.625 --> 16:45.046
He's an actor who didn't
lie to my face every day.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.801
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, I got it. Ouch.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.556
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.683

Hey.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.444
Get some sleep.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.781
I'll sleep when I know
you're safe.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.164
(children shouting playfully)

17:19.205 --> 17:21.207
(siren chirps)

17:22.959 --> 17:25.128
You think this is fun?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.714
You think water's supposed
to be fun?

17:27.756 --> 17:30.300
Try swimming in the
Mariana Trench,

17:30.341 --> 17:31.843
you little fucking idiots.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.345
Yeah, not so fun there.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.640
No, it's dark and it's cold.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.268
-And you're so alone.
-OFFICER: Sir?

17:41.603 --> 17:43.188
-You're so...
-Sir?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.315
...goddamn fucking alone.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.649
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:49.778 --> 17:52.906
(keys jingling)

17:55.158 --> 17:56.910
Swim free, little fish.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.203
You made bail.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.206
(squishing)

18:01.247 --> 18:04.083
(laughter)

18:06.419 --> 18:09.464
(laughter continues)

18:09.506 --> 18:11.508
Hey, man.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.967
Want a Fresca?

18:15.386 --> 18:16.763
Thanks.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.348
Hey, I know you.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.893
Yeah, you're, uh, Raven...
Ravenwing.

18:21.935 --> 18:25.688
It's Eagle. Eagle the Archer.
Out of Cleveland?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.690
We met, like, five times
at Vought-Con.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.902
I mean-- mm.
No, that doesn't matter.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.779
You bailed me out?

18:32.821 --> 18:35.240
-Yeah.
-Why?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.867
Because even heroes need
a hand once in a while.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.118
Come on.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.832
The Translucent franchise,

18:43.873 --> 18:46.960
especially Invisible Force 2,
is...

18:48.127 --> 18:49.462
Please.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.881
My baby needs a mother.

18:51.923 --> 18:55.969
Oi! Shut your trap,
you dumb bird,

18:56.010 --> 18:59.472
or else I'll bollocks you.

18:59.514 --> 19:02.809
But that's exactly what
William Butcher did.

19:02.851 --> 19:06.104
He murdered Vought Vice
President Madelyn Stillwell

19:06.145 --> 19:09.858
using upwards of 30 pounds
of C-4.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.568
Why would William Butcher
do it?

19:11.609 --> 19:14.946
Disgruntled, perhaps,
over his deceased wife,

19:14.988 --> 19:16.489
a former Vought employee.

19:16.531 --> 19:21.411
And why was Madelyn Stillwell's
baby found safe in a yard

19:21.452 --> 19:23.204
17 miles away?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.623
It is a puzzle.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.126
Where is Monsieur Charcuter?

19:28.167 --> 19:31.588
-Why hasn't he called?
-Who cares?

19:31.629 --> 19:32.881
He could be dead.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.173
(chuckles):
No. No.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.675
He's too much of an asshole
to die.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.219
-(shushing)
-...or any of his known
associates--

19:38.261 --> 19:41.306
Marvin Milk, Hugh Campbell,
or this man,

19:41.347 --> 19:43.266
whose real identity
is unknown--

19:43.308 --> 19:47.854
please call 1-888-0-CRIMES.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.314
Christ.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.691
(sighs)

19:51.733 --> 19:54.736
We gotta get out of here, now.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.405
Good passports do not
come cheap.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.616
I sell the RPGs,
smuggle in the Kalashnikovs.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.784
We have enough money.
That's it.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.373
-Where will you go,
Petit Hughie?
-Could just stay here.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.417
With Frenchie's gangbanger
friends.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.544
The cots, they got 31 flavors
of semen on them.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.629
You'll love 'em.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.506
Oh, and you have a better idea?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.634
No, maybe we can stay,
all of us,

20:17.675 --> 20:18.801
in your mother's asshole.

20:18.843 --> 20:22.472
Or... maybe we could not run.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.933
FRENCHIE:
You are like a record
that is broken.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.352
Well, we shouldn't just give up.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.270
Guys, we get some Compound V,

20:29.312 --> 20:30.980
we-we bring it to
The New York Times,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.315
we burn Vought to the ground.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.775
MOTHER'S MILK:
You got some V, Hughie?

20:33.816 --> 20:36.235
-'Cause I don't.
-We could...

20:36.277 --> 20:39.197
get some.
Someone could help us get it.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.240
And who might that be?

20:43.284 --> 20:44.827
FRENCHIE:
You did not hear the television?

20:44.869 --> 20:46.746
We are famous now.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.247
-Butcher even more so.
-Fuck Butcher!

20:48.289 --> 20:49.499
We don't need him.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.000
A-Team had Hannibal.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.002
Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.879
Beatles, Brian Epstein.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.381
We don't need Butcher.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.718
FRENCHIE:
Okay, who's going to
be our captain? You?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.680
I mean, guys, just-just-just
hear me out.

21:03.721 --> 21:07.016
Shut the fuck up!

21:11.437 --> 21:12.647
This is over.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.616
(door closes)

21:46.347 --> 21:48.349
(sighs)

21:53.271 --> 21:55.565
(door closes in distance)

22:20.923 --> 22:23.217
(pulsing)

22:38.107 --> 22:40.026
(exhales sharply)

23:00.838 --> 23:01.923
Homelander, hi.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.466
-(bottle drops)
-Ashley.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.093
(clears throat)

23:05.134 --> 23:08.471
Glad to see you're, uh,
making yourself at home.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.307
Yeah.
(chuckles)

23:11.349 --> 23:13.392
Renovation is definitely
overdue.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.062
It's like 2003 called,
they want their office back.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.271
You know?

23:17.313 --> 23:19.565
Huh. I liked it.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.776
Yeah, me, too.
It was really great.

23:21.818 --> 23:24.654
Homelander, I just want
to thank you again

23:24.695 --> 23:26.823
for recommending me
for this job.

23:26.864 --> 23:31.744
I was so surprised
to get the call.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.956
I am gonna fill
Ms. Stillwell's shoes

23:34.997 --> 23:36.791
as best I can.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.628
God rest her soul.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.754
Yeah.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.966
God rest it. Yeah.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.096
Any luck catching her killer,
that Butcher maniac?

23:51.806 --> 23:55.268
No, not yet.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.312
But we will.

23:58.354 --> 23:59.856
Oh, good news.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.482
I think I found a hero.

24:01.524 --> 24:05.236
Perfect candidate
to replace Translucent.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.363
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.823
So soon?

24:08.865 --> 24:10.158
He's in the gym right now.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.284
You want to meet him?

24:11.325 --> 24:13.286
Do I?

24:13.327 --> 24:15.204

We're gonna poll through

an ethnic female

24:55.912 --> 24:58.206

Wow.

25:02.627 --> 25:05.171
That's-that's impressive.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.381
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.635
Can I just say, that is amazing.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.763
And you, my friend,
are a true hero.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.640
Not because of what you do
for a job,

25:15.681 --> 25:17.850
but... (sighs)

25:17.892 --> 25:19.393
well, because of what
you've overcome.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.978
Thank you.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.314
That means everything

-Yeah.

-Yeah.

I don't know, I do this?

25:57.390 --> 26:01.686
What made you think I would ever
allow a cripple into The Seven?

26:01.727 --> 26:04.814
For fuck sakes, Ashley,
don't look at him, look at me!

26:04.855 --> 26:06.315
(Blindspot groaning)

26:06.357 --> 26:09.568
Ashley! Look at me.

26:09.610 --> 26:12.989
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Let's get one thing straight.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.075
The only reason you're here
and not doing corporate PR

26:16.117 --> 26:17.994
for fucking Diva Cups

26:18.035 --> 26:19.787
is that I brought you here.

26:19.829 --> 26:22.957
You are dispensable,
which means you answer to me.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.375
Okay. Okay.

26:26.168 --> 26:29.463
From now on,
I will set my own agenda,

26:29.505 --> 26:30.881
I'll approve my own marketing

26:30.923 --> 26:32.925
and write my own talking points.

26:32.967 --> 26:36.012
You will tell me everything
that goes on

26:36.053 --> 26:39.098
on the 99th floor,
and I mean everything.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.850
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

26:40.891 --> 26:44.562
If a fucking light bulb
goes out, you will tell me.

26:44.603 --> 26:49.483
And, Ashley, in no fucking way

26:49.525 --> 26:53.612
do you decide
who goes in The Seven.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.824
I decide.

26:56.866 --> 26:59.493
Do we have an understanding?

26:59.535 --> 27:01.245
Yes.

Margaret.

I'd love to follow up on that.

What do you mean
when you say you hate

33:52.698 --> 33:54.116
the term "Super Terrorist"?

33:54.158 --> 33:56.076
I just mean, it's really scary.

33:56.118 --> 33:57.494
It makes me want
to lock the door

33:57.536 --> 33:59.037
and hide under the bed,
you know?

33:59.079 --> 34:00.539
Which means a double-digit drop

I keep saying

34:03.876 --> 34:06.503
"Super Villain"

Uh, "Super Criminals" sounds
like something in a cartoon.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.842

about "Super Villain."

34:11.884 --> 34:14.344
Uh, what about the term
"Super Villain"?

34:14.386 --> 34:17.514
That sounds better to me.
More exciting.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.392

34:25.606 --> 34:27.608
which do you prefer?

34:27.649 --> 34:30.652
"Saving America,"
can I get a show of hands?

34:30.694 --> 34:34.281
Okay. How about
"Saving the World"? Wow.

34:34.323 --> 34:36.950
Unanimous, strong reaction.
So what is it about...

34:36.992 --> 34:40.078
Nope. It's "Saving America."

34:40.120 --> 34:42.706
Uh...

34:42.748 --> 34:46.001
I-I don't know. I-I feel like
"Saving the World" has a...

34:46.043 --> 34:49.338
JILL:
Okay. But is there
something specific

34:49.379 --> 34:51.548
about "Saving the World"
that "Saving America..."

34:51.590 --> 34:54.259
It's Americans that are gonna
keep us in the Army,

34:54.301 --> 34:56.512
not the fucking world.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.514
It's "Saving America."

34:58.555 --> 35:00.933
Mm-hmm?

35:00.974 --> 35:02.893
-Pull the trigger.

I...

I don't think

EAGLE:
Uh, f-for me,

36:15.424 --> 36:20.220
my aha moment came with
a hostage situation at Kroger.

36:20.262 --> 36:22.264
Multiple shooters.

36:22.306 --> 36:27.769
I showed up, I'm letting
arrows fly, my aim is perfect.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.813
But...

36:31.857 --> 36:37.029
...there's only so many arrows
a quiver can hold.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.865
I just ran out.

36:39.907 --> 36:45.329
And then, we lost
a lot of good people that day.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.457
Then you start to question,

36:48.498 --> 36:52.711
like, fucking arrows
against TEC-9s?

36:52.753 --> 36:56.548
-But?
-But I came to see

36:56.590 --> 37:00.802
that archery isn't irrelevant,
it's timeless.

37:00.844 --> 37:05.432
It's a pure and ancient art.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.643
Carol helped me see that.

37:07.684 --> 37:09.645
And what are you, his therapist

37:09.686 --> 37:12.356
-or something?
-(laughs): No.

37:12.397 --> 37:16.193
No, therapy's
very destructive, actually.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.362
You could say I'm his teacher.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.156

37:21.198 --> 37:23.492
What-what about, what about me?

37:23.533 --> 37:25.285
How did you end up here?

37:26.703 --> 37:28.747
You can tell her, Deep.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.918
(chuckles):
Tell her what?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.544
About your drinking.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.755
About your self-esteem issues.

37:36.797 --> 37:39.174
-Really open up, Deep.
-No, I don't...

37:39.216 --> 37:40.801
I don't have a drinking...
(laughs softly)

37:40.842 --> 37:42.761
-I'm fine.
-This is a safe space, Deep.

37:42.803 --> 37:45.722
CAROL:
If you don't have
any self-esteem issues,

37:45.764 --> 37:47.933
why are you constantly
demeaning women?

37:47.975 --> 37:50.352
-That's a good question, Deep.
-Okay, thank you.

37:50.394 --> 37:51.979
You know what? I don't know
what the fuck this is,

37:52.020 --> 37:54.272
but it's weird as fuck,
so I'm leaving.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.108
W-We just want to help.

37:56.149 --> 37:58.902
-Carol really helped me, Deep.
-No, thank you.

NEWS ANCHOR:
Yesterday, the Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children

38:21.842 --> 38:24.803
at Splash Zone
in Sandusky, Ohio.

38:33.395 --> 38:34.813

38:46.158 --> 38:47.993
You wrote something.

"Boy."

38:52.414 --> 38:54.207
What boy?

38:54.249 --> 38:57.210

39:03.925 --> 39:05.844
(huffs)

39:05.886 --> 39:08.263
Okay, so?

39:08.305 --> 39:10.891
They were wired the money
from a blind account

39:10.932 --> 39:12.768
to smuggle the bastard in.

What do we do?

39:24.696 --> 39:27.282

39:29.034 --> 39:30.827
Yeah, I'm sure that'll go
straight to the mayor.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.496
You saw that video.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.747
What if he does that
to-to an airplane?

39:33.789 --> 39:35.499
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

39:35.540 --> 39:38.418
So, what's your big plan,
Hughie?

39:38.460 --> 39:41.254
Okay, the CIA lady, right?

39:41.296 --> 39:42.589
Rayner.

39:42.631 --> 39:45.342
Right, the same CIA

39:45.383 --> 39:47.511
that wants to clamp our nuts

39:47.552 --> 39:49.096
into some jumper cables.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.098
We could call Butcher.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.974
For the last time,
we don't need Butcher.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.851
Then what?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.980
We should...

39:59.022 --> 40:01.024
call Annie.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.026
(chuckles)

40:03.068 --> 40:05.487
"Call Annie."

40:07.823 --> 40:09.825
Annie?

40:11.535 --> 40:12.577
Yeah.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.580
You mean Starlight?

40:17.040 --> 40:20.085
'Cause that's who she is.

40:20.127 --> 40:24.297
Vought has her phone
so bugged...

40:24.339 --> 40:26.675
they're praying
that you do that.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.389
Oh, no.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.974
You fucking called her?

40:34.015 --> 40:36.810
No, no. I'm not,
I'm not stupid, okay?

40:39.229 --> 40:41.481
-I texted her.
-Oh, fuck.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.859
And then we met up, but we're
getting some Compound V.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.403
-Fuck you, Hughie!
Are you fucking crazy?
-M.M., easy!

40:46.444 --> 40:47.863
-Are you fucking crazy?!
-We were careful!

40:47.904 --> 40:49.030
-What the fuck are you doing?!
-We used burner...

40:49.072 --> 40:51.158
-We used burner phones.
-Kid, you don't get it!

40:51.199 --> 40:52.659
They could've been
following you.

40:52.701 --> 40:55.745
They could be watching us
right fucking now!

40:57.455 --> 40:59.708
If you're the fucking reason

40:59.749 --> 41:01.501
why I can't finish

41:01.543 --> 41:03.336
that Vermont country dollhouse,

41:03.378 --> 41:04.880
I will fucking end you.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.339
You've been walking
around for days

41:06.381 --> 41:08.008
like you want to kick my ass,

41:08.049 --> 41:10.260
so do it already.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.058
Goddamn it.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.561
(sighing)

41:19.603 --> 41:20.979
Shit!

41:24.024 --> 41:26.902
I don't want to kick
your ass, Hughie.

41:26.943 --> 41:30.530
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

41:30.572 --> 41:33.325
I want to get home to my wife

41:33.366 --> 41:35.160
and my kid.

41:35.202 --> 41:37.245
That's it.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.707
If I still can.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.375
This guy could kill
a lot of people.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.337
Hughie... let somebody else
handle it, okay?

41:45.378 --> 41:46.463
There's no one else!

41:46.504 --> 41:47.797
No one's coming to save us.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.090
You don't get it.

41:49.132 --> 41:51.343
You are not a soldier.

41:51.384 --> 41:54.137
You're not a spy.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.723
You're just a kid that
sells stereo equipment.

41:56.765 --> 41:58.016
No, I don't!

41:59.142 --> 42:01.228
I don't have a job.

42:03.271 --> 42:06.149
Or Robin.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.776
Or my dad.

42:07.817 --> 42:10.654
Or Annie.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.240
One way or another,
they all, uh...

42:17.160 --> 42:19.663
Now all I have is this.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.748
This.

42:21.790 --> 42:24.251
Which is really fucking
depressing, but it's true.

42:26.628 --> 42:30.382
So, maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

42:30.423 --> 42:33.134
But I can be Harry Potter.

42:33.176 --> 42:36.638
Or, uh... you know, John Connor

42:36.680 --> 42:39.766
or-or-or what's her name
from The Hunger Games.

42:39.808 --> 42:40.892
Katniss.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.729
Yeah, the point is
I could be the person

42:44.771 --> 42:46.731
that nobody thinks is awesome,

42:46.773 --> 42:49.776
but it turns out they're
kind of fucking awesome.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.738
M.M.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.198
Listen, we help the CIA lady,

42:55.240 --> 42:58.034
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.578
Did you ever think of that?

43:04.291 --> 43:05.375
(sighs)

43:05.417 --> 43:06.876
My baby needs a mother!

43:06.918 --> 43:10.463
Oi! Shut your trap,
you dumb bird...

43:10.505 --> 43:13.758
or else I'll bollocks you.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.887
MAN (on TV):
But that's exactly
what William Butcher did.

43:20.724 --> 43:21.891
Gecko?

43:21.933 --> 43:23.685
Is that you?

43:23.727 --> 43:25.145
Starlight?

43:25.186 --> 43:27.439
I mean, Annie, hi.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.482
-Hi.
-Oh, my God, hi!

43:31.359 --> 43:33.528
Look at you,
big-time Seven hero.

43:33.570 --> 43:34.738
Oh, shut up.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.323
You know, I-I work
in Vought Tower

43:36.364 --> 43:38.908
at the, uh, labs on-on 67?

43:38.950 --> 43:40.577
Oh, you don't say?

43:40.618 --> 43:41.995
I see your posters everywhere.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.580
They're marketing
the shit out of you.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.831
(scoffs)

43:44.873 --> 43:48.001
I'm happy for you, really.

43:48.043 --> 43:50.420
Buy you some coffee?

43:50.462 --> 43:52.672
(laughs) Thank you.

43:52.714 --> 43:55.216
Yeah, at the, uh, Capes for
Christ Bible Camp, yes, totally.

43:55.258 --> 43:57.052
Mm-hmm, that Passion play
we put on?

43:57.093 --> 43:58.678
You were the best Jesus.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.679
I mean, no one's gonna take

43:59.721 --> 44:01.056
a nail through the hand
like I can.

44:01.097 --> 44:03.475
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

44:03.516 --> 44:06.311
Oh, my God, those freckles.

44:06.353 --> 44:07.937
You know he wanted
to make out with me?

44:07.979 --> 44:09.898
-Pontius Pilate
and Mary hooking up?
-Mm-hmm.

44:09.939 --> 44:10.940
Ooh, "sacri-licious."

44:10.982 --> 44:12.192
Yeah, we never did.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.610
Why not?

44:13.651 --> 44:15.612
-He was so cute.
-Yeah, it just,

44:15.653 --> 44:17.113
it was what Ezekiel always said.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.448
And my mom, too.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.033
That God is watching over you,

44:20.075 --> 44:22.077
every second.

44:22.118 --> 44:24.079
You know, I thought
that He was watching us,

44:24.120 --> 44:26.539
and I thought
that He'd be upset.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.166
Yeah, it's a,
it's a messed up thing

44:28.208 --> 44:29.667
-to tell a kid.
-Yeah.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.836
But looking back?

44:31.878 --> 44:34.506
I should've made out
with Big Game.

44:34.547 --> 44:36.966
I should've done
a lot more stuff.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.510
Because...

44:38.551 --> 44:40.929
there is nothing

44:40.970 --> 44:42.931
up there.

44:42.972 --> 44:46.559
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

44:48.311 --> 44:51.231
Not God, not Homelander.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.442
Not anybody.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.696
It's all just...

44:58.738 --> 45:00.865
lies.

45:10.458 --> 45:13.044
I need a favor.

45:13.086 --> 45:14.504
Yeah.

45:14.546 --> 45:17.173
Yeah, anything
for a Bible Camp alum.

45:21.386 --> 45:23.346
(clears throat, smacks lips)

45:23.388 --> 45:25.515
I need you to go
into the labs on 67,

45:25.557 --> 45:28.226
and steal me
a sample of Compound V.

45:31.271 --> 45:33.356
Um...

45:33.398 --> 45:35.024
I, uh...

45:35.066 --> 45:36.609
I don't,
I don't know what that is.

45:36.651 --> 45:38.319
Ah, see?

45:38.361 --> 45:42.073
Another lie.

45:42.115 --> 45:44.284
I know how we're made.

45:44.325 --> 45:46.744
And it is not Jesus.

45:48.621 --> 45:49.956
I can't.

45:49.998 --> 45:51.040
I mean, it's impossible.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.125
I'm a nobody there.

45:52.167 --> 45:53.585
I'm a lab rat.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.211
They cut off my limbs
and they grow back.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.255
-I can't get you...
-You have to.

45:57.297 --> 46:00.008
Or I put this
on Facebook tonight.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.597
Gecko,

46:05.638 --> 46:07.432
former teen star

46:07.474 --> 46:10.101
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

46:10.143 --> 46:13.438
working as an S&M hooker

46:13.480 --> 46:15.732
as a side hustle?

46:17.901 --> 46:21.446
I'm sure inquiring minds
will want to know.

46:21.488 --> 46:24.199
Annie?

46:24.240 --> 46:25.658
I thought that we were friends?

46:25.700 --> 46:28.203
I'm sorry.

46:28.244 --> 46:29.787
But...

46:29.829 --> 46:31.873
we're not anything.

46:39.881 --> 46:41.883
(helicopter blades whirring)

46:41.925 --> 46:43.092
Hi.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.677
You know who we are.

46:44.719 --> 46:46.888
But let's meet another hero.

46:46.930 --> 46:50.016
This is Lance Corporal
Dan Miller.

46:50.058 --> 46:52.477
Dan and the other brave
Marines of Second Battalion

46:52.519 --> 46:56.022
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

46:56.064 --> 46:57.732
We're proud to fly
alongside them.

46:57.774 --> 47:00.443
And now, we could use
your support.

47:00.485 --> 47:03.446
That's right, Maeve, with our
new campaign, Saving America.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.907
Here I go, you guys!
Wish me luck.

47:05.949 --> 47:08.660
Oh, FYI, not a real base.

47:08.701 --> 47:11.746
As if Homelander and Maeve
are gonna eat MREs

47:11.788 --> 47:13.748
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

47:13.790 --> 47:15.750
Uh, hey, yeah, hi, we're
filming right now. Excuse me?

47:15.792 --> 47:19.295
Also, you might recognize
"Army Boy" as Hotel Clerk #2

47:19.337 --> 47:21.297
-from "The Devil's Breath"
-Hello, excuse-- okay.

47:21.339 --> 47:23.174
episode of Criminal Minds:
Beyond Borders.

47:23.216 --> 47:24.592
Well, hello!

47:24.634 --> 47:26.636
Oh, my God, hi!

47:26.678 --> 47:28.137
My nana's your biggest fan.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.264
I'm Stormfront.

47:29.305 --> 47:30.723
-Great.
-Oh, right, yeah.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.559
From Seattle, right?

47:32.600 --> 47:38.773
Uh... Portland, actually,
Your, uh, Highness.

47:38.815 --> 47:41.067
Holy shit!

47:41.109 --> 47:43.111
Your eyes are really
fucking blue up close.

47:43.152 --> 47:44.445
(chuckles)

47:44.487 --> 47:46.573
You are... fun.

47:46.614 --> 47:48.491
It's been a hoot,
but we got work to do,

47:48.533 --> 47:50.243
so... let's get back to it.

47:50.285 --> 47:52.370
Oh, totally, uh,

47:52.412 --> 47:54.455
they just wanted me to meet you.

47:54.497 --> 47:55.748
Who?

47:55.790 --> 47:58.209
Oh, the boys on 82.

47:58.251 --> 48:00.503
-I'm the new girl.
-Wait...

48:00.545 --> 48:02.839
what are you talking about?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.340
Oh! Hi.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.092
I'm in The Seven.

48:06.134 --> 48:08.595
Replacing Translucent.

48:08.636 --> 48:10.847
God bless his soul.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.057
Ink's barely dry, but, uh,

48:13.099 --> 48:14.809
yeah, reporting for duty,

48:14.851 --> 48:17.270
so... fuck yeah!

48:17.312 --> 48:19.397
Um, no, I don't think that
this is, it's not true.

48:19.439 --> 48:21.899
I don't know anything
about this.

48:21.941 --> 48:23.276
Wow!

48:23.318 --> 48:27.322
Well, uh, Stormfront?

48:27.363 --> 48:29.741
Who delivered the good news?

48:29.782 --> 48:33.161
STORMFRONT:
Oh, uh, Mr. Edgar,

48:33.202 --> 48:35.496
the big guy?

48:35.538 --> 48:38.124
-MAN: All right, back to one.
-Wonderful.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.126
Great.

48:40.168 --> 48:42.879
All right!

48:42.920 --> 48:46.466
-Great!
-MAN: We're going again, people.

48:46.507 --> 48:49.677
Well, I think
this is going great.

48:53.306 --> 48:54.891
MOTHER'S MILK:
You know,

48:54.932 --> 48:56.809
you ain't John Cusack, man.

48:56.851 --> 48:59.937
You ain't got
no motherfucking boom box.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.939
-Sorry?
-You want to get back together

49:01.981 --> 49:03.650
-with Starlight.
-No. No-no, I don't.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.151
Yes. Yes, you do.

49:05.193 --> 49:07.737
But this ain't the way
to do it, Hughie.

49:07.779 --> 49:09.530
You can't keep
pulling this shit, man.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.783
Calling her, texting her.

49:11.824 --> 49:13.576
Are you crazy?

49:13.618 --> 49:14.702
You know, you sound
like Butcher.

49:14.744 --> 49:16.537
-She's on our side.
-I know.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.081
I'm saying this for her, kid.

49:18.122 --> 49:19.957
You're putting her in danger.

49:19.999 --> 49:22.585
Homelander finds out that
she's been talking to you?

49:22.627 --> 49:25.046
She's fucked.

49:25.088 --> 49:27.423
The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

49:27.465 --> 49:29.926
the deeper in the meat grinder
she goes.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.348
RAYNER:
How are you guys doing?

49:35.390 --> 49:37.308
MOTHER'S MILK:
We're hanging in there.

49:37.350 --> 49:38.893
RAYNER:
Has Butcher contacted you?

49:38.935 --> 49:40.061
Nope.

49:40.103 --> 49:42.605
He's completely ghosted.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.650
Do you think he killed
Madelyn Stillwell?

49:45.692 --> 49:47.443
MOTHER'S MILK:
I'd like to think
that he didn't.

49:47.485 --> 49:50.655
But I... I don't know.

49:52.699 --> 49:54.742
Deputy Director,
I know this might not be

49:54.784 --> 49:56.953
the best time to ask,
but do you ever...?

49:56.994 --> 49:58.621
Hear about your family?

49:58.663 --> 50:02.458
Your daughter is, uh,
starting soccer, I think.

50:04.168 --> 50:07.338
Soccer?

50:07.380 --> 50:09.841
Um, ma'am.

50:09.882 --> 50:11.592
Can M.M. see them?

50:11.634 --> 50:15.138
You know what, let's,
let's see if this checks out.

50:15.179 --> 50:18.057
And I will see what I can do.

50:19.350 --> 50:22.186
Thank you, ma'am.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.646
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

50:23.688 --> 50:27.442
All right, uh,
about five-ten, 165,

50:27.483 --> 50:30.445
black hair, wearing
knockoff jeans and sneakers

50:30.486 --> 50:34.031
probably from Taiwan,
maybe India.

50:34.073 --> 50:36.659
You got all that from the video?

50:36.701 --> 50:38.619
So, the other shoe drops,

50:38.661 --> 50:40.455
and it just crushes us all.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.540
MOTHER'S MILK:
Meaning?

50:42.582 --> 50:46.169
Meaning I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

50:46.210 --> 50:48.504
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.506
And I think you

50:52.049 --> 50:53.885

-Come on! Get in!
Go, go, go, go, go!

Must be a Supe out there.

51:16.616 --> 51:18.534

51:18.576 --> 51:20.286

No one!

Look, I have a daughter.

51:25.625 --> 51:29.170
I'm worried about
Super Terrorists, too.

51:29.212 --> 51:31.130
But that does not mean

51:31.172 --> 51:34.258
that Vought can use
that fear to control us.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.885
-Morning.
-Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry, I...

51:35.927 --> 51:37.220

That's all right, Samantha.

51:37.261 --> 51:38.596
Busy day. (chuckles)

51:38.638 --> 51:39.806
Morning, Homelander.

51:42.517 --> 51:44.477
Well, you never come up to 99.

51:44.519 --> 51:46.854
So, figured I'd pay you a visit.

51:46.896 --> 51:49.148
-What a lovely idea.
-(chuckling): Right?

51:49.190 --> 51:51.234
After all,
you run a superhero company,

51:51.275 --> 51:54.278
and, uh, you never check in
with your superheroes,

51:54.320 --> 51:56.364

for example.

52:01.244 --> 52:03.579
You wished to be consulted
on Stormfront?

52:03.621 --> 52:05.581
Well, why not?

52:05.623 --> 52:08.292
I signed off on all the rest.

52:08.334 --> 52:09.961

52:18.511 --> 52:20.304

Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.893
No, no. Stan.

Vought.

Our esteemed founder.

53:22.742 --> 53:25.328
Well, I don't know, um,
not a lot, probably.

53:25.369 --> 53:27.622
I only read his autobiography...

53:27.663 --> 53:29.832
-five times?
-(chuckles softly)

53:29.874 --> 53:31.918
Not the self-serving bullshit

53:31.959 --> 53:34.420
that we peddle to the
shareholders, the real story.

53:34.462 --> 53:37.882
-Enlighten me.
-Got his doctorate from Munich.

53:37.924 --> 53:39.884
Ahead of his time in genetics.

53:39.926 --> 53:43.679
Such the rising young star
that in '39,

53:43.721 --> 53:46.307
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

53:46.349 --> 53:49.310
where he enjoyed
a ready supply of human subjects

53:49.352 --> 53:52.188
on which to test his earliest
iterations of Compound V.

53:52.229 --> 53:56.484
For which we condemn in
the strongest of possible terms.

53:56.525 --> 53:59.236
Early in '44,
he felt the winds change,

53:59.278 --> 54:01.489
got spirited away to the Allies.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.574
When Oppenheimer was
flailing with the bomb,

54:03.616 --> 54:07.411
Dr. Vought already had practical
applications of Compound V

54:07.453 --> 54:08.663
tested in the field.

54:08.704 --> 54:11.207
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

54:11.248 --> 54:13.876
killing Germans by the dozen.

54:13.918 --> 54:17.088
So, Roosevelt pardoned him,

54:17.129 --> 54:20.341
and he became
as Wonder Bread American

54:20.383 --> 54:22.885
as Disney and Edison.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.388
Well, this is
a truly fascinating,

54:25.429 --> 54:29.016
if not slightly condescending
lecture, but, um...

54:29.058 --> 54:31.352
I don't think
I see the point, Stan.

54:31.394 --> 54:32.895
The point is...

54:32.937 --> 54:35.523
that you are
under a misconception

54:35.564 --> 54:37.233
that we are a superhero company.

54:37.274 --> 54:38.651
We are not.

54:38.693 --> 54:41.529
What we are, really,
is a pharmaceutical company.

54:41.570 --> 54:45.032
And you are not
our most valuable asset.

54:45.074 --> 54:48.828
That would be our confidential
formula for Compound V.

You slipped Compound V
to terrorists all over the globe

55:01.841 --> 55:04.468
to get you and your cronies
into national defense.

55:04.510 --> 55:07.304

FDA now knows about Compound V,
