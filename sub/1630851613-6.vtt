00:02.291 --> 00:06.088
(water trickling)
(ominous music)

00:13.561 --> 00:15.060
(dramatic whooshing)

00:15.160 --> 00:18.317
(light dramatic music)

00:32.425 --> 00:37.301
(Fran groans)
(metal clanging)

00:37.860 --> 00:39.858
- Hello?

00:41.257 --> 00:42.596
(light dramatic music)
Jamie!

00:42.696 --> 00:44.694
Jamie, I'm down here!

00:46.333 --> 00:48.331
Jamie, get away from her,
she's a fucking psycho!

00:50.009 --> 00:51.588
Jamie!

00:51.688 --> 00:52.987
(suspenseful music)

00:53.087 --> 00:56.144
(gun bangs)
(gun clicks)

00:56.244 --> 00:58.682
(light music)

01:00.880 --> 01:02.878
- How is it?

01:03.358 --> 01:04.097
- Delicious.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.775
Thanks, mate.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.414
- Mate?

01:07.514 --> 01:09.412
We're not plumbers, Jamie.

01:09.512 --> 01:10.851
- Right, yeah.

01:10.951 --> 01:12.949
Sorry.

01:15.947 --> 01:18.524
- Thinking about
she-who-must-not-be-named again?

01:18.624 --> 01:19.723
- No, no, no.

01:19.823 --> 01:22.081
Well, a bit.

01:22.181 --> 01:23.999
I haven't heard from her.

01:24.099 --> 01:25.958
- We've been
through this, Jamie.

01:26.058 --> 01:28.675
You need to forget
about Fran and move on.

01:28.775 --> 01:32.152
I know it's tough but
she certainly has.

01:32.252 --> 01:35.190
Off to Japan without
so much as a peep

01:35.290 --> 01:38.227
to her so-called best friend.

01:38.327 --> 01:41.284
But you've got me now, and
I'm not going anywhere.

01:44.282 --> 01:46.280
Hope you've left some
from for the kedgeree.

01:47.279 --> 01:49.957
(both chuckling)

01:51.675 --> 01:54.213
(water trickling)
(birds chirping)

01:54.313 --> 01:58.929
(Fran grunts)
(phone beeps)

01:59.029 --> 02:00.527
Oh, Franny.

02:00.627 --> 02:01.846
You're awake.

02:01.946 --> 02:04.004
I'm so glad.

02:04.104 --> 02:05.443
- What the hell
is going on, Kat?

02:05.543 --> 02:06.802
What the fuck do you want?

02:06.902 --> 02:09.380
- Oh, sounds like
somebody's hungry.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.475
Seeing as you won't be
going to Japan anymore,

02:14.575 --> 02:18.651
I thought I might bring
a bit of Japan to you.

02:21.929 --> 02:24.586
(plate clattering)

02:24.686 --> 02:26.025
You might regret that
when you see what

02:26.125 --> 02:28.123
you'll be eating from now on.

02:30.041 --> 02:32.319
(Kat sighs)

02:35.077 --> 02:37.974
Well (giggles).

02:38.074 --> 02:39.413
- Jamie, help!

02:39.513 --> 02:41.252
I'm down here!

02:41.352 --> 02:43.350
- Jamie, please help!

02:46.147 --> 02:48.965
Oh no, this place is
totally soundproofed.

02:49.065 --> 02:51.842
I could skin you alive and
Jamie wouldn't hear a squeak.

02:51.942 --> 02:53.761
- If this is a weird sex thing,

02:53.861 --> 02:55.799
I need you to know I'm actually
pretty vanilla, you know?

02:55.899 --> 02:57.637
I'm a glass of pinot and three
minutes of disappointment

02:57.737 --> 02:59.036
kind of a girl.

02:59.136 --> 02:59.935
If you want more than
that you're gonna have

03:00.015 --> 03:00.754
to just kill me now.

03:00.854 --> 03:02.353
- Don't be silly, Fran.

03:02.453 --> 03:04.431
If I killed you you
wouldn't be able to watch.

03:04.531 --> 03:05.390
- Watch what?
(ominous music)

03:05.490 --> 03:07.588
- Jamie, of course.

03:07.688 --> 03:12.364
Oh, lovely Jamie happily
going about her life with me.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.081
Her new best friend.

03:16.641 --> 03:19.658
Now it's your turn to
be cast aside helpless

03:19.758 --> 03:22.156
while she forgets
you even exist.

03:23.754 --> 03:27.331
You're gonna spend the
rest of your miserable life

03:27.431 --> 03:31.967
learning just how crazy
that can make you feel.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.765
(suspenseful music)

03:33.865 --> 03:35.284
(dramatic music)

03:35.384 --> 03:37.562
- You did all of
this because Jamie

03:37.662 --> 03:40.280
became my friend at school?

03:40.380 --> 03:42.038
Have you ever thought
about therapy or,

03:42.138 --> 03:43.557
I don't know, taking up
a flute or something?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.155
- I don't know.

03:45.255 --> 03:47.074
Knock down some flats,
offer Jamie a place to live,

03:47.174 --> 03:49.392
drive a wedge between you two.

03:49.492 --> 03:51.989
It was almost disappointingly
easy, to be honest.

03:52.089 --> 03:53.988
- But you've not been
very thorough, have you?

03:54.088 --> 03:58.264
Because news flash, nut
bag, your new best friend

03:58.364 --> 04:00.362
is a contract killer.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.959
And so am I.

04:05.318 --> 04:08.375
- Well your boss is
going to come looking

04:08.475 --> 04:09.654
for you, isn't he?

04:09.754 --> 04:11.372
- Yeah.

04:11.472 --> 04:14.809
- But do you think if I could
talk to Mr. V, maybe it might-

04:14.909 --> 04:17.527
- No, he's not gonna be
very interested in t...

04:17.627 --> 04:19.205
(light dramatic music)

04:19.305 --> 04:21.603
How did you know
his name was Mr. V?

04:21.703 --> 04:23.801
- His name?
(light dramatic music)

04:23.901 --> 04:24.901
- You know that new
client who keeps giving us

04:24.980 --> 04:26.279
these amazing jobs?

04:26.379 --> 04:27.398
(gun bangs)
(woman groans)

04:27.498 --> 04:29.496
- Mr. V?

04:29.856 --> 04:31.834
(suspenseful music)

04:31.934 --> 04:33.933
- Holy shit.

04:34.332 --> 04:37.310
- That look on your face, Fran.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.408
Do you mind if I smoke?

04:40.127 --> 04:42.745
But it's not easy tracking
down trained killers,

04:42.845 --> 04:45.602
it took me years, but then I...

04:47.760 --> 04:50.138
Then I engineered a perfect
excuse to bump into you.

04:50.238 --> 04:52.536
- Class of '89 reunion!

04:52.636 --> 04:54.295
- I'm head of the
organising committee.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.454
Control freak alert.

04:55.554 --> 04:58.531
- And set myself up as Mr. V.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.529
pulling contracts
off the dark web.

05:00.629 --> 05:01.888
It really is amazing
what you find on there,

05:01.988 --> 05:04.066
and then giving them
to my two new clients.

05:05.904 --> 05:07.443
There was something
so fucking delicious

05:07.543 --> 05:09.281
about knowing where you
were, who you were with,

05:09.381 --> 05:11.120
who you were killing.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.957
Pulling all the
strings between you.

05:14.057 --> 05:16.915
- And there is a
little sofa emoji

05:17.015 --> 05:18.793
hurdling its way down the M6.

05:18.893 --> 05:22.989
- And without Mr. V how could
I execute my master stroke?

05:23.089 --> 05:24.188
- We've got sent another job.

05:24.288 --> 05:26.027
- The Japan job.

05:26.127 --> 05:27.585
- I'm embarrassed to show
you the salary, but...

05:27.685 --> 05:31.142
- What better way to pander
to your pathetic ego?

05:31.242 --> 05:32.581
Pull your friendship apart.

05:32.681 --> 05:34.419
- I think you should go, Fran.

05:34.519 --> 05:37.736
- Make Jamie believe that you'd
fallen off the map forever.

05:37.836 --> 05:40.454
Maybe it would've been
easier to take up the flute,

05:40.554 --> 05:44.890
but why play an instrument when
you can play the orchestra?

05:44.990 --> 05:47.728
(ominous music)

05:47.828 --> 05:49.246
- Fucking psycho.

05:49.346 --> 05:51.684
You fuck, fucking
psycho, you psycho bitch!

05:51.784 --> 05:53.842
Get away, bitch!

05:53.942 --> 05:55.920
- Temper temper.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.019
Oh, I nearly forgot.

05:58.778 --> 06:00.556
I thought you might
need something

06:00.656 --> 06:03.454
to help you through
this difficult time.

06:05.252 --> 06:08.150
- [Kat Recording] Hello and
welcome to "It's All About You"

06:08.250 --> 06:10.248
with me, Kat Gateskill.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.945
Chapter one, destiny is

06:14.045 --> 06:15.583
a three letter word.
- I only smoke after sex.

06:15.683 --> 06:18.381
- [Kat Recording] Y-O-U.

06:18.481 --> 06:20.139
Are you ready to live a new life

07:12.833 --> 07:16.929
I've never been to Fiji, but
I'd like to go there one day.

07:17.029 --> 07:19.247
They say that no
man is an island.

07:19.347 --> 07:22.045
That's true, I'm not an island,

07:22.145 --> 07:24.303
I'm a continent and so are you.

07:25.901 --> 07:27.840
I sincerely hope
that completing this

07:27.940 --> 07:29.718
12 hour introduction course
- Yes, yes.

07:29.818 --> 07:30.957

Is just a first step

07:31.057 --> 07:32.635
on an exciting new journey.

07:32.735 --> 07:34.354
- Well you've locked me in
a basement, so I doubt it!

07:34.454 --> 07:37.351
- [Kat Recording] But for
now, have a good afternoon.

07:37.451 --> 07:38.710
(Fran gasps)

07:38.810 --> 07:41.887
And remember, you deserve it.

07:43.126 --> 07:45.125
- Oh, thank god.

07:45.604 --> 07:47.542
- Hello and welcome to-
- No, no shut up!

07:47.642 --> 07:49.641
Shut up, shut up!

08:01.230 --> 08:02.569
Right, what have I got?
- Are you ready to live

08:02.669 --> 08:04.487
a life filled with adventure.
- Great, dog food.

08:04.587 --> 08:07.645
- And new horizons.
- Oh god, not even Iams,

08:07.745 --> 08:09.243
the stingy cow.

08:09.343 --> 08:11.841
Right, this is 40%
beef, meaty chunks,

08:11.941 --> 08:13.879

08:16.817 --> 08:18.815
I mean, how bad can it be?

08:19.374 --> 08:22.152
- [Kat Recording] And
the potential of you

08:22.252 --> 08:24.750
for the beginning of living
openly and courageously

08:24.850 --> 08:26.848
in your own personal universe.

08:30.445 --> 08:33.122
- Right, you're not
responding to my messages,

to resist singing along to

off on that key change,

so you will have to adjust
your line accordingly.

10:01.525 --> 10:03.783
But, seriously mate, though,

10:03.883 --> 10:06.240

checking the windows

11:46.273 --> 11:49.889
Mutton, beef, baked beans?

11:49.989 --> 11:51.608
- [Kat Recording] I can relate.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.126
Sometimes I feel like I'm
trapped in my own success.

11:54.226 --> 11:56.244
- You utter bitch!
- Anger is not your friend.

11:56.344 --> 12:01.139
- Bitch!
(light dramatic music)

12:03.697 --> 12:05.795
- Oh, morning.

12:05.895 --> 12:07.894
Get back to sleep okay?

12:10.491 --> 12:12.769
(Kat sighs)

12:14.048 --> 12:16.046
Going somewhere?

12:16.486 --> 12:17.785
- Sorry, Kat, I need to go
and check that Fran's okay.

12:17.885 --> 12:20.263
- Oh, Jamie, how many times?

12:20.363 --> 12:22.341
She's on the other
side of the world.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.018
- Yeah, I think there's
something seriously wrong.

12:25.118 --> 12:29.255
- Fran doesn't want you
to contact her ever again.

12:29.355 --> 12:32.092
She was very
explicit about that.

12:32.192 --> 12:34.190
- I don't remember
telling you that.

12:35.509 --> 12:38.167
- No, I just mean her soft
launch, the way she behaved.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.685
She was basically
saying "Fuck you".

12:40.785 --> 12:43.482
- Kat, listen, I just feel
that something's not right.

12:43.582 --> 12:47.319
And I know Fran messed
up, but whatever happens

12:47.419 --> 12:49.717
she'll always be my best friend.

12:49.817 --> 12:51.275
And if I think she

12:51.375 --> 12:52.834
might be in trouble.
- Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran.

12:52.934 --> 12:55.232
Why do I have to keep
hearing about fucking Fran?

12:55.332 --> 12:56.830
She's gone, you idiot!

12:56.930 --> 12:58.949
(glass shattering)
- Oh my god, Kat.

12:59.049 --> 13:01.047
- [Kat] Oh.

13:02.206 --> 13:03.385
- Kat, you're bleeding.

13:03.485 --> 13:06.422
- Oh, Jamie, I'm
sorry, you're right.

13:06.522 --> 13:08.500
If you're worried
about your friend,

13:08.600 --> 13:12.297
you should go and check on her.

13:12.397 --> 13:14.055
- Thanks, Kat.

13:14.155 --> 13:17.013
- Maybe I could make you
something yummy before you go.

13:17.113 --> 13:19.171
Don't want to send you
off with an empty stomach.

13:19.271 --> 13:21.009
(light dramatic music)
- Okay, a quick snack

13:21.109 --> 13:23.287
and then I've gotta go.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.966
- Okay.

13:25.066 --> 13:27.404
Well, you set the table and
I'll throw something together.

13:27.504 --> 13:29.642
(light dramatic music continues)

13:29.742 --> 13:32.819
(silverware clanging)

13:40.132 --> 13:43.030
- [Kat Recording] There's
only the absence of success.

13:43.130 --> 13:47.746
(light dramatic music continues)

13:47.846 --> 13:50.483
And you can try this
exercise anywhere; in bed,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.619
at a picnic with friends.

13:55.719 --> 13:57.717
Just take a deep breath

14:00.994 --> 14:03.352
and say I am in control.
- The fuck is that?

14:05.270 --> 14:07.988
(suspenseful music)
Oh, my God.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.325
Jamie, don't eat
anything she gives you.

14:11.425 --> 14:12.604
Jamie, Jamie!
- Everything else

14:12.704 --> 14:14.362
is welcome to be forgiven.

14:14.462 --> 14:17.380
(suspenseful music)

14:19.578 --> 14:21.596
- Oh come on, think.
- Climbing every mountain

14:21.696 --> 14:23.274
and swimming every sea.
- Think, think, think.

14:23.374 --> 14:25.153
(Fran sighs)
- The best part?

14:25.253 --> 14:27.711
You're only just
getting started.

14:27.811 --> 14:29.669
Let me ask you a question.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.466
Can someone else suffer for you?

14:32.566 --> 14:35.304
Can someone else feel
pleasure for you?

14:35.404 --> 14:39.161
How about, can someone
achieve your goals for you?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.278
- Hope you're hungry!

14:45.515 --> 14:47.533
- Oh.

14:47.633 --> 14:48.972
(Jamie inhales)

14:49.072 --> 14:51.070
Smells great.

14:53.548 --> 14:56.965
- Jamie, you've
forgotten my spoon.

14:57.065 --> 15:00.622
Honestly, if your head
wasn't screwed on.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.919
- [Kat Recording] That's
the day you start living

15:04.019 --> 15:05.158
your life for you.

15:05.258 --> 15:07.256
- [Fran] Here we go, yes!

15:09.574 --> 15:14.330
- Ah.
(Jamie hums)

15:16.808 --> 15:19.165
(Kat slurps)

15:22.483 --> 15:23.781
(Jamie hums)

15:23.881 --> 15:24.800
- [Kat Recording] I
want you to promise me

15:24.880 --> 15:26.459
that you'll never say the words

15:26.559 --> 15:28.957
"It was somebody else's
fault" ever again.

15:30.356 --> 15:31.654
If you're not happy
with your situation,

15:31.754 --> 15:36.011
it's nobody's fault but-
(alarm beeping)

15:36.111 --> 15:38.448
- [Jamie] What's that?

15:38.548 --> 15:40.527
- Oh, don't worry, I think
I know what's happened.

15:40.627 --> 15:42.625
You wait here.

15:46.981 --> 15:51.817
(light dramatic music)
(keys jingling)

15:53.935 --> 15:55.354
Where are you, Fran?

15:55.454 --> 15:59.450
(light dramatic music continues)

16:05.205 --> 16:07.603
(phone beeps)

16:11.599 --> 16:13.598
- Oh my...

16:14.637 --> 16:16.255
- [Kat Recording] I sincerely
hope that completing

16:16.355 --> 16:18.573
this 12 hour introductory
course is just

16:18.673 --> 16:21.810
the first step on an exciting-
- Oh fuck, fuck.

16:21.910 --> 16:24.048
- [Kat Recording] But for
now, it's goodbye from me.

16:24.148 --> 16:25.607
Kat Gateskill.

16:25.707 --> 16:29.424
With love, hugs, and
bucket loads of positivity.

16:31.502 --> 16:35.518
You deserve it.
- Okay, you wanna play,

16:35.618 --> 16:39.575
I'll fucking play.
(suspenseful music)

16:43.971 --> 16:45.969
Jamie?

16:46.489 --> 16:48.147
Jamie!

16:48.247 --> 16:49.786
Oh, there you are.

16:49.886 --> 16:53.063
We have to go now, I think
there might be an intruder.

16:53.163 --> 16:54.342
- What are you doing with this?

16:54.442 --> 16:56.420
- Have you been going
through my office?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.298
I can't believe
you'd abuse my trust.

16:58.398 --> 16:59.657
- What have you done with Fran

16:59.757 --> 17:01.256
and what are you doing
with that shotgun?

17:01.356 --> 17:03.354
- I'll explain that later,
but now we have to go.

17:04.673 --> 17:07.290
Why can't you just do what
you're fucking told for once?

17:07.390 --> 17:10.448
(women grunting)

17:10.548 --> 17:12.366
You were my best friend first.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.464
She was just a new girl.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.242
(Kat grunts)

17:16.342 --> 17:18.241
(suspenseful music)

17:18.341 --> 17:21.798
(spray hisses)
(Kat shrieks)

17:21.898 --> 17:23.236
- [Kat Recording] Are
you ready to break free

17:23.336 --> 17:25.335
and start really enjoying life?

17:26.533 --> 17:30.770
Here's a secret: you-
(dramatic music)

17:33.048 --> 17:34.826
- [Kat] Jamie!

17:34.926 --> 17:37.684
(gun bangs)
- Shit.

17:40.122 --> 17:42.060
- [Kat Recording] I
want to open your mind,

17:42.160 --> 17:44.418
just like you've
opened this book.

17:44.518 --> 17:46.416
For an account on my website,

17:46.516 --> 17:49.213
look at the other
side of this book.

17:49.313 --> 17:53.030
(suspenseful music continues)

18:12.693 --> 18:14.691
- Shit.

18:16.570 --> 18:20.586
(birds chirping)
(suspenseful music)

18:20.686 --> 18:23.224
- Jamie.

18:23.324 --> 18:25.322
I just want to talk.

18:38.191 --> 18:43.026
(Fran grunts)
(ground rustling)

18:45.784 --> 18:48.941
(light dramatic music)

19:00.451 --> 19:02.429
Jamie.

19:02.529 --> 19:03.788
I know we can work this out,

19:03.888 --> 19:05.926
I just want what's best for you.

19:06.805 --> 19:08.304
- Jamie.

19:08.404 --> 19:10.402
Jamie.

19:14.399 --> 19:16.397
- [Kat] Jamie.

19:17.476 --> 19:21.293
Come on.
(light dramatic music)

19:21.393 --> 19:23.131
(Jamie groans)

19:23.231 --> 19:24.410
Jamie?

19:24.510 --> 19:26.208
(both giggling)

19:26.308 --> 19:27.247
(Fran hushes)
- You're here!

19:27.347 --> 19:28.246
- Yes, I am.

19:28.346 --> 19:29.066
I've been here the whole time.

19:29.146 --> 19:29.765
- What? In the maze?

19:29.865 --> 19:31.324
- No.

19:31.424 --> 19:32.822
No, she locked me in the
basement after the soft launch.

19:32.902 --> 19:34.721
- Oh, Fran, I'm so sorry.

19:34.821 --> 19:36.000
You were totally right.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.398
- Yeah.
- She's insane.

19:37.498 --> 19:38.957
She's trying to kill me.

19:39.057 --> 19:40.476
- Listen, she had the house
hooked up with cameras

19:40.576 --> 19:42.234
and I saw everything.

19:42.334 --> 19:43.833
- Were you watching
me on the toilet?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.271
- Why would your
mind go there first?

19:45.371 --> 19:47.370
- Okay, but were you though?

19:48.449 --> 19:50.467
- No.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.626
Really good to see you.

19:51.726 --> 19:53.384
- [Jamie] Oh, you too, mate.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.622
- Okay.

19:55.722 --> 19:57.301
- Yeah.

19:57.401 --> 20:00.578
- [Fran] Let's get outta here.

20:00.678 --> 20:03.575
(gun bangs)
(dramatic music)

20:03.675 --> 20:05.294
- Well isn't this perfect?

20:05.394 --> 20:08.211
Fran getting between
me and Jamie yet again.

20:08.311 --> 20:10.130
- You've only got one shot left.

20:10.230 --> 20:12.847
- Don't worry, this thing
can rip through a car door.

20:12.947 --> 20:14.945
One shot's enough
for the pair of you.

20:17.144 --> 20:20.341
Why couldn't you just
be my friend, Jamie?

20:21.420 --> 20:23.418
That's all I wanted.

20:24.337 --> 20:28.534
I became a multimillionaire,
I put you up in a palace,

20:29.373 --> 20:31.551
I got my teeth fixed.

20:31.651 --> 20:36.546
And still, you're
choosing her over me.

20:36.646 --> 20:39.784
- That's not exactly how
friendship works though, is it?

20:39.884 --> 20:41.862
- People fucking died
so we could be together.

20:41.962 --> 20:43.061
- Wait, what?

20:43.161 --> 20:45.419
- Oh, I'll tell you later.

20:45.519 --> 20:47.097
- Wait, Kat.

20:47.197 --> 20:49.855
We can still be friends, we
can all three be friends.

20:49.955 --> 20:52.612
I mean, three is a great
number for friendship.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.331
The Three Amigos.

20:54.431 --> 20:56.769
Harry, Hermione,
Ron, the Sugarbabes.

20:56.869 --> 20:58.407
I know there were
a lot of lineups,

20:58.507 --> 21:00.905
but at base always
just the three.

21:02.424 --> 21:04.122
- Wow.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.120
You really mean that, Jamie?

21:06.220 --> 21:07.120
The three of us?

21:07.220 --> 21:09.218
- Definitely.

21:10.377 --> 21:12.535
- Sorry, Jamie, but
three's a crowd.

21:17.211 --> 21:20.408
(light dramatic music)

21:21.287 --> 21:23.905
(Kat groans)

21:24.005 --> 21:25.863
- She poisoned the
food, I knew it.

21:25.963 --> 21:27.102
- No, she poisoned your food.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.501
I saw her do it.

21:28.601 --> 21:31.019
- I switched the bowls.
(suspenseful music)

21:31.119 --> 21:33.397
(Kat gasps)

21:37.713 --> 21:39.491
- I'm sorry.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.090
- [Fran] A bit late for that.

21:41.190 --> 21:42.648
- I know she's
trying to kill us,

21:42.748 --> 21:45.726
but is it weird that I actually
feel kind of bad for her?

21:45.826 --> 21:48.443
I mean, her last words
were "I'm sorry".

21:48.543 --> 21:49.562
- I'm sorry I didn't
kill you both.

21:49.662 --> 21:50.761
(gun bangs)
- Jesus!

21:50.861 --> 21:52.919
(Kat groans)

21:53.019 --> 21:54.558
- (sighs) Still
feeling sorry for her?

21:54.658 --> 21:55.557
- Not at all, no.

21:55.657 --> 21:56.796
- No, shall we?

21:56.896 --> 21:58.035
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:58.135 --> 21:58.994
Come on.
- Come on.

21:59.094 --> 22:01.032
- Let's go.

22:01.132 --> 22:03.270
- [Jamie] So, just to recap...

22:03.370 --> 22:04.269
- [Fran] How many more times?

22:04.369 --> 22:05.708
I did not see you take a dump.

22:05.808 --> 22:07.666
- [Jamie] Oh god, oh.

22:07.766 --> 22:09.145
Hang on, it's this way.
- No, no, no, it's not.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.224
This is way.

22:10.324 --> 22:11.623
I'm sure.
- Oh no, come this way.

22:11.723 --> 22:12.902
- Oh, okay.
- No, trust me, trust me.

22:13.002 --> 22:14.580
- [Jamie] Okay.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.778
No, it's just it would kinda
change the dynamic of things.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.816
- [Fran] What, the dynamic
of who's seen who do a poo?

22:19.916 --> 22:21.854
- [Jamie] Yeah, I mean
basically to even things up

22:21.954 --> 22:24.252
I'd have to then
view you doing a poo.

22:24.352 --> 22:25.271
- [Fran] Well if we don't
get out of here soon

22:25.351 --> 22:26.730
that's gonna become a reality.

22:26.830 --> 22:28.688
- Oh, that's it.
- Okay, this is the exit.

22:28.788 --> 22:30.786
Oh.
- Oh, for God's sake.
