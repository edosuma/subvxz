you kids out of.

positively ID Jayden.

31:07.932 --> 31:09.334

when he shows up?

Well, that's the problem.
No one's saying anything.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.019
Fess up.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.188
Mm...
Dad just gave it away.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.989
I certainly did not.

40:58.989 --> 41:01.425
Spill it or we walk.
FRANK:
Hey.

41:01.425 --> 41:03.227
(Janko laughs)
Sorry.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.662
Really, a surprise?

41:04.662 --> 41:06.964
Maybe it's
the archbishop again?

41:06.964 --> 41:09.700
No, it's got to be Lenny.
He's late.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.035
Is it Joe?

41:11.035 --> 41:12.803
Well, I guess
we'll know soon enough.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.104
Well, how soon?

41:14.104 --> 41:15.639
Isn't the food
getting cold?
HENRY: Yeah.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.308
(doorbell rings)
Ah.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.410
HENRY: Thank heaven.
Eddie, you're closest.

41:20.277 --> 41:21.846
Oh. Okay, well,

41:21.846 --> 41:25.449
if it's someone from my family,
I apologize in advance.

41:25.449 --> 41:27.251
(chuckles)

41:30.521 --> 41:31.922
(sighs)

41:31.922 --> 41:34.625
(stammers) Witten, I don't--
I don't know what to say.

41:34.625 --> 41:39.096
(stammers)
Don't say anything.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.399
You were just doing your job

41:42.399 --> 41:44.501
and I respect
the hell out of that.

41:45.502 --> 41:47.071
Thank you.

41:49.373 --> 41:50.908
'Cause it was killing me.

41:50.908 --> 41:52.643
Yeah, me too.

41:52.643 --> 41:55.045
ERIN:
Um, hello?
We're waiting.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.915
DANNY:
And starving. Ooh.

41:57.915 --> 42:00.818
(both chuckling)

42:02.086 --> 42:03.888
Hey!
(overlapping greetings)

42:03.888 --> 42:05.422
Welcome.

42:05.422 --> 42:07.324
And please, please, sit down.

42:07.324 --> 42:10.094
This bus is on the move.
All right.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.597
This is a nice surprise.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.835
We only have
one rule here.

42:17.835 --> 42:19.203
Keep your arms and legs

42:19.203 --> 42:20.504
away from Eddie
when she starts eating,

42:20.504 --> 42:22.439
'cause she might rip
your limbs off.

42:22.439 --> 42:24.141
Oh, you think
I don't know that?
I figured you did.

42:24.141 --> 42:25.476
(Witten chuckles)
Witten.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.912
Thank you all
for having me.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.682
Thank you for
making this happen.

42:31.682 --> 42:35.653
Now you know why
she's sitting next to me.
