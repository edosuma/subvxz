[scream]

00:50.742 --> 00:53.843
Mom, why do we
watch these movies?

00:53.845 --> 00:57.380
Maybe because we're
not supposed to.

00:57.382 --> 00:59.549
And they're fun.

00:59.551 --> 01:01.953
I thought these
movies were scary.

01:01.955 --> 01:05.756
They are... so scary
that most people would

01:05.758 --> 01:07.893
close their eyes or run away.

01:07.895 --> 01:09.895
But we don't.

01:09.897 --> 01:12.330
When the shadows are dark,
and the music is creepy,

01:12.332 --> 01:17.401
and you know you should close
your eyes, we take a peek...

01:17.403 --> 01:23.743
boo!... and laugh
because now you know.

01:23.745 --> 01:25.812
Know what?

01:25.814 --> 01:29.481
That you're stronger than
anything you're afraid of.

01:29.483 --> 01:30.786
Pretty cheesy, Mom.

01:34.356 --> 01:35.923
I'm going to
check in on Jeanie.

01:35.925 --> 01:37.156
OK.

01:37.158 --> 01:40.027
You two continue to
scare yourself silly.

01:40.029 --> 01:41.129
Thanks, babe.

01:43.566 --> 01:44.733

01:44.735 --> 01:45.568
Yeah.

04:22.671 --> 04:23.703
"Blood feast."

04:23.705 --> 04:26.439
It actually sounds
kind of boring.

04:26.441 --> 04:28.675
Boring?
Come on, Sis.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.145
"Blood Feast" is
a Herschell Gordon

04:30.147 --> 04:31.880
Lewis cinematic classic, OK?

04:31.882 --> 04:34.715
Blood Fest, the thing
that I'm going to,

04:34.717 --> 04:39.121
is the greatest horror
event of all time.

04:39.123 --> 04:40.122
It's gonna suck.

04:40.124 --> 04:41.991
Whatever, Jayme.

04:41.993 --> 04:43.026
DR. CONWAY: Dax?

04:43.028 --> 04:46.728
Will you come to
my office, please?

04:46.730 --> 04:48.231
(MUMBLING) Hey,
shut the fuck up.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.100
Cheers!

05:00.880 --> 05:04.951
Hey, you, uh,
wanting to see me?

05:09.056 --> 05:11.488
You know, I'm being
interviewed on Network News

05:11.490 --> 05:12.224
tonight.

05:12.226 --> 05:13.124
It's kind of a big deal.

05:13.126 --> 05:14.393
I really want you to be there.

05:16.696 --> 05:18.264
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

05:18.266 --> 05:19.932
I... I'll, uh, I'll try to come.

05:19.934 --> 05:24.036
I'm going to be talking
about Blood Fest...

05:24.038 --> 05:27.907
how I and my family are
totally opposed to it,

05:27.909 --> 05:34.780
how no child of mine would
ever set foot on those grounds.

05:34.782 --> 05:36.250
You understand?

05:36.252 --> 05:37.918
Mm-hmm.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.987
Good.

05:39.989 --> 05:42.791
Then, uh, you won't
be needing this.

05:48.764 --> 05:50.098
Wait a minute, I...

05:50.100 --> 05:52.200
look, I think I'm old enough
to make my own decision.

05:52.202 --> 05:55.070
You live in my house.

05:55.072 --> 06:00.242
I don't understand this
obsession with violence, Dax.

06:00.244 --> 06:02.810
Dad, it's... it's movies.

06:02.812 --> 06:03.878
I don't know what to tell you.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.316
It poses as
entertainment, but it's

06:06.318 --> 06:10.619
these kind of movies that drove
my patient to kill your mother.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.721
How do you not see that?

06:12.723 --> 06:13.824
This isn't about her.

06:16.761 --> 06:20.097
Please, don't... don't do that.

06:20.099 --> 06:23.200
Blood Fest is a gathering
of freaks and degenerates

06:23.202 --> 06:27.939

violence and gore.

You've got to
stop watching that.

07:25.003 --> 07:27.669
You're torturing yourself.

07:27.671 --> 07:29.305
We'll find another ticket.

07:29.307 --> 07:31.341
The whole thing has
been sold out for months.

07:31.343 --> 07:34.244

07:43.922 --> 07:45.323

07:48.194 --> 07:49.526
Morning, Krill.

07:49.528 --> 07:51.062
I'm now ready to forsake
my virtual multiverses

07:51.064 --> 07:53.898
for a weekend of Blood Fest.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.267
Plus, I think it's
time that I find

07:55.269 --> 07:58.736
the extraordinary lady worthy
enough to de-flower me,

07:58.738 --> 08:00.205
the Krill.

08:00.207 --> 08:02.207
It's mind boggling that no
one has snatched you up yet.

08:02.209 --> 08:03.775
I know, right?
That's what I'm saying.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.009
It's crazy out here.

08:05.011 --> 08:05.878
It's crazy out here
in this world, man.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.348
Where... what... what... what...

08:08.350 --> 08:10.350
what's up with him?

08:10.352 --> 08:12.751
His dad found his wristband.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.121
You guys just go
ahead without me.

08:15.123 --> 08:16.021
Maybe you should call Ashley.

08:16.023 --> 08:17.157
She could probably get you in.

08:17.159 --> 08:18.359
Oh, please don't
mention her, dude.

08:18.361 --> 08:19.226
There's a "Hell's Nest"
panel at Blood Fest.

08:19.228 --> 08:20.263
She probably has an extra pass.

08:22.298 --> 08:23.696
I... I... I can't...

08:23.698 --> 08:24.931
I can't believe... It's so wrong.

08:24.933 --> 08:28.402
Ashley Spats... Ashley
Spats is at Blood Fest.

08:28.404 --> 08:29.770
And I'm stuck here.

08:29.772 --> 08:32.340
You know, Ashley who thought
"Black Christmas" was

08:32.342 --> 08:34.275
a Tyler Perry holiday movie.

08:34.278 --> 08:36.777
You know, sh... sh... she refuses
to watch "Seven," because she

08:36.779 --> 08:37.778
didn't see the first six.

08:37.780 --> 08:38.846
OK.

08:38.847 --> 08:40.347
She thought that
"28 Days Later"

08:40.350 --> 08:42.318
was a... was a health doc about
the fucking menstrual cycle.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.921
Dax, you're pitiful.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.957
Here's something
that you really want,

08:48.959 --> 08:53.430
and you're going to
let your dad stop you?

08:53.432 --> 08:55.399
He's a... he's a scary guy.

08:55.401 --> 08:58.168
Everyone's dad is a scary guy.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.769
Nut up.

08:59.771 --> 09:01.039
You were made for Blood Fest.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.811
Blood Fest.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.780
I'll call her.

09:09.782 --> 09:10.881
You happy?

09:10.883 --> 09:11.917
Yeah.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.523

DAX (ON PHONE): I just
wanted to congratulate you on

09:28.835 --> 09:31.338
your new movie, "Hell's Nest."

09:31.340 --> 09:35.007
Looks like it's
going to be awesome.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.977
So you're... you're a...
you're an actor in it, right?

09:37.979 --> 09:40.447
You're... oh, God... wha...
wha... what are you...

09:40.449 --> 09:41.915
what are you playing again?

09:41.917 --> 09:42.983
Topless girl number four.

09:42.985 --> 09:44.918
Topless girl number
four, that's it.

09:44.920 --> 09:45.952
It's a key role.

09:45.954 --> 09:48.054
It's no topless
girl number three.

09:48.056 --> 09:50.090
I'd kill for topless
girl number three.

09:50.092 --> 09:51.325
Well, you're in a movie.

09:51.327 --> 09:52.460
That's awesome.

09:52.462 --> 09:53.661
You're making your
dreams come true.

09:53.663 --> 09:56.265
Uh, if you need, uh,
a ride to... uh, to...

09:56.267 --> 09:58.467
Blood Fest, you're more
than welcome to, uh...

09:58.469 --> 10:02.371
Uh, I'm actually here already,
you know, to emotionally

10:02.373 --> 10:03.871
prepare for the fans.

10:03.873 --> 10:06.509
I'm trying to find a way in.

10:06.511 --> 10:09.912
They have more barbed wire
here than an S&M summer camp.

10:09.914 --> 10:12.881
Wait, Ashely, the...
the reason I'm calling...

10:12.883 --> 10:13.749
What's taking him so long?

10:13.751 --> 10:15.218
Why doesn't he just ask her?

10:15.220 --> 10:16.985
I've known Dax a long time.

10:16.987 --> 10:18.556
He survived some hard stuff.

10:18.558 --> 10:20.823
And he's got his pride.

10:20.825 --> 10:22.193
Dax is not going a
coward just so he can...

10:22.195 --> 10:24.495
Please, Ashley, just...
just get me through the door!

10:24.497 --> 10:28.097
I'm literally on my
knees begging you, look.

10:28.099 --> 10:29.367
That's me begging.

10:29.369 --> 10:30.468
Do you get it?

10:30.470 --> 10:31.168
Scratch that.

10:31.170 --> 10:33.137
He's cookie dough.

10:33.139 --> 10:36.006
Let's go to Blood Fest!

10:36.008 --> 10:37.942
SAM: Why all the rules?

10:37.944 --> 10:41.213
Freddy only kills in
dreams, virgins survive.

10:41.215 --> 10:43.549
Michael won't just build a
dirty bomb and kill them all.

10:43.551 --> 10:44.450
These rules.

10:44.452 --> 10:46.184
DAX: You've got to have rules.

10:46.186 --> 10:47.886
Otherwise, death
would be random...

10:47.888 --> 10:49.921
just chaotic and meaningless.

10:49.923 --> 10:51.324
SAM: That's life.

10:51.326 --> 10:53.527
DAX: If movies were life,
no one would buy a ticket.

[music playing]

11:53.327 --> 11:56.461
Please have your
wristbands on and visible.

11:56.463 --> 11:57.663
This is so beautiful.

11:57.665 --> 12:00.064
It's like some twisted
and horrific heaven.

12:00.066 --> 12:03.602
Tone it back, boys.

12:03.604 --> 12:05.237
Hi.

12:05.239 --> 12:06.106
Hey.

12:11.945 --> 12:13.245
Wristband.

12:13.247 --> 12:15.348
I'm actually supposed to
be meaning someone here.

12:15.350 --> 12:16.081
Dax.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.351
Oh, she's right there.

12:17.353 --> 12:18.084
Whoa.

LENJAMIN: Oh, it's cool.

12:18.721 --> 12:21.622
He's with me.

12:21.624 --> 12:23.089
Thanks.

12:23.091 --> 12:24.391
Ashley, you are a lifesaver.

12:24.393 --> 12:27.628
This is Lenjamin Cain,
director of "Hell's Nest."

12:27.630 --> 12:29.128
He's why you're here.

12:29.130 --> 12:30.964
Thanks, baby.

12:30.966 --> 12:31.965
Appreciate it.

12:31.967 --> 12:32.835
Uh-huh.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.339
It's my pleasure.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.573
It's my pleasure to help out.

12:38.575 --> 12:42.378
Uh, babe, I'm sorry,
but why is this fanboy

12:42.380 --> 12:44.012
getting in under my name?

12:44.014 --> 12:45.481
He's a friend.

12:45.483 --> 12:48.617
And besides, you did it for
me, your little pooky pokey

12:48.619 --> 12:49.719
pooky bear.

12:49.721 --> 12:51.487
LENJAMIN: Oh, yeah?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

12:51.489 --> 12:52.521
Rawr.

12:52.523 --> 12:53.255
LENJAMIN: Pooky
bear needs a poke?

12:53.257 --> 12:55.625
I'm a naughty bear.

12:55.627 --> 12:57.059
Uh, OK.

12:57.061 --> 13:00.196
Uh, well, thanks very much
for getting me in, Lenjamin.

13:00.198 --> 13:01.665
And congratulations on the film.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.232
Oh, thank you so much.

13:03.234 --> 13:04.401
It's... it's shit.

13:04.403 --> 13:06.637
It's the shit.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.071
It's the shit.

13:08.073 --> 13:11.007
I left out that article.

13:11.009 --> 13:14.177
I got to ask you to leave.

13:14.179 --> 13:15.112
I'm messing with you.

13:15.114 --> 13:16.213
Oh, OK.

13:16.215 --> 13:17.348
I'm messing with you.

13:17.350 --> 13:18.684
Yeah, you're going
to love the film.

13:18.686 --> 13:19.451
When it comes out,
everybody's going to love it.

13:19.453 --> 13:22.086
Ashley's great in it.

13:22.088 --> 13:23.522
- Stacked.
- Really?

13:23.524 --> 13:24.590
We need to go.

13:24.592 --> 13:26.057
Namaste.

13:26.059 --> 13:27.559
OK.

13:27.561 --> 13:30.697
That was awkward.

13:30.699 --> 13:32.197
That's my balloons.

13:32.199 --> 13:35.568
[music playing]

13:35.570 --> 13:37.236
Clown Town?

13:37.238 --> 13:38.003
That's not even funny.

13:38.005 --> 13:39.706
We're not going there.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.039
We're going everywhere, dude.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.342
You don't like clowns?

13:42.344 --> 13:44.512
You know I don't like clowns!

13:44.514 --> 13:47.450
[music playing]

13:51.487 --> 13:52.422
Nice balloons.

13:57.828 --> 14:00.060
She's the one.

14:00.062 --> 14:02.631
She's the one I will
lay with tonight.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.832
SAM: Lucky girl.

14:03.834 --> 14:04.566
Someone should tell her.

14:04.568 --> 14:05.603
KRILL: Why do you joke?

14:08.673 --> 14:09.806
Oh, my God...

14:09.808 --> 14:10.673
the Arborist.

14:10.675 --> 14:11.841
SAM: Whoa, he trimmed the beard.

14:11.843 --> 14:12.608
KRILL: Dax, you've
got to go meet him.

14:12.610 --> 14:14.278
It's the Arborist!

14:16.246 --> 14:21.552
Roger Hinckley, you, sir,
are the scariest man alive.

14:21.554 --> 14:23.654
Hey, check it out.

14:23.656 --> 14:25.489
I got a, uh, tattoo.

14:25.491 --> 14:26.590
Oh.

14:26.592 --> 14:28.057
Arbor Day?

14:28.059 --> 14:31.763
Between you and me though, part
four is my favorite, all right?

14:31.765 --> 14:33.230
Never saw it.

14:33.232 --> 14:35.767
Part four?

14:35.769 --> 14:38.202
Never saw any of them.

14:38.204 --> 14:41.306
You've never seen
any of your own films?

14:41.308 --> 14:44.142
I don't like scary movies, OK?

14:44.144 --> 14:45.310
It's too much gore.

14:45.312 --> 14:49.247
The sight of blood
just makes me want to...

14:49.249 --> 14:50.651
I used to puke after every take.

14:54.623 --> 14:55.956
Wou... would it
be too much to ask

14:55.958 --> 15:00.159
if you'd possibly do the
Arborist catchphrase for me?

15:00.161 --> 15:01.162
Yeah.

15:03.130 --> 15:03.998
It would be.

15:08.872 --> 15:10.337
Hey, a big fan.

15:10.339 --> 15:13.273
I actually disemboweled you in a
modded version of Mortal Kombat

15:13.275 --> 15:14.276
the other day.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.246
Um, dude, let's go.

15:18.248 --> 15:19.550
The kick-off party's
about to start.

15:25.421 --> 15:27.689
Asshole.

15:27.691 --> 15:30.158
DAX: That was devastating.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.194
SAM: Never meet your heroes.

15:32.196 --> 15:35.698
It's always a letdown.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.165
This should cheer you up.

15:37.167 --> 15:40.168
[cheering]

15:40.170 --> 15:43.576
[music playing]

15:47.479 --> 15:55.921
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one!

15:55.923 --> 15:57.523
[applause]

16:05.900 --> 16:07.467
[applause]

16:09.403 --> 16:12.337
I've got a question!

16:12.339 --> 16:15.775
Who wants some horror!

16:15.777 --> 16:16.778
[applause]

16:20.583 --> 16:25.586
Inside these gates,
we have re-created all

16:25.588 --> 16:28.321
your cinematic scare-scapes...

16:28.323 --> 16:32.760
from summer camps to
asylums to circuses!

16:32.762 --> 16:33.962
Clowns, not the clowns.

16:33.964 --> 16:37.966
Every monster or maniac
to ever spill blood

16:37.968 --> 16:40.367
on the silver screen
has been granted

16:40.369 --> 16:43.237
a portion of these grounds.

16:43.239 --> 16:46.474
And it's all for you.

16:46.476 --> 16:50.345
I want this man to adopt me.

16:50.347 --> 16:55.417
But children... children,
we have a problem.

16:55.419 --> 16:58.520
Horror is dead.

16:58.522 --> 17:00.389
I mean, look around you!

17:00.391 --> 17:02.491
Our vampires glitter!

17:02.493 --> 17:05.796
Our zombies have become
soap opera stars!

17:05.798 --> 17:11.935
Our slashers have
grown dull and old.

17:11.938 --> 17:14.371
We put Freddy on a lunchbox!

17:14.373 --> 17:17.608
We put Lovecraft
in a coloring book!

17:17.609 --> 17:21.545
We have overconsumed
and overproduced,

17:21.547 --> 17:27.318
and we have taken what was
forbidden, what was dangerous,

17:27.319 --> 17:29.423
and we have made it common.

17:36.296 --> 17:37.864
Wanna make movies scary again?

17:37.866 --> 17:41.367
[cheering]

17:41.369 --> 17:42.568
Wanna do it tonight?

17:42.570 --> 17:43.971
Yeah!

17:43.973 --> 17:47.710
Wanna make a horror movie
to end all horror movies?

17:51.781 --> 17:53.782
Ladies and gentleman!

17:53.784 --> 17:58.720
I give you Red!

17:58.722 --> 18:01.958
[cheering]

18:10.835 --> 18:14.469
Let me introduce you to your
new favorite nightmare, your

18:14.471 --> 18:17.708
dark id, your boner for blood.

18:17.710 --> 18:24.014
And if you come up on
stage, he will kill you.

18:24.016 --> 18:26.415
Any volunteers?

18:26.417 --> 18:28.018
Uh, should I?

18:28.020 --> 18:30.487
You two girls, come on up!

18:30.489 --> 18:31.388
Wonderful!

18:31.390 --> 18:33.390
Give them a round of applause!

18:33.392 --> 18:34.158
[applause]

18:34.160 --> 18:35.392
Oh, my... oh, my god.

18:35.394 --> 18:36.460
It's... it's them.

18:36.462 --> 18:37.494
- It's them.
- It's your soulmate.

18:37.496 --> 18:38.462
KRILL: Yeah!

18:38.464 --> 18:40.597
Don't be shy!

18:40.599 --> 18:42.968
You look beautiful!

18:42.970 --> 18:45.773
Ladies, meet Red!

18:49.409 --> 18:50.410
Oh.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.429
[cheering]

19:09.431 --> 19:12.599
That was amazing!

19:12.601 --> 19:14.601
That was... that
was pretty good.

19:14.603 --> 19:17.673
[suspenseful music]

19:23.579 --> 19:25.679
So when do you start filming?

19:25.681 --> 19:28.150
Oh, we're already filming.

19:28.152 --> 19:30.687
[chainsaw starts]

19:32.556 --> 19:36.491
And the best part?

19:36.493 --> 19:37.594
This shit's for real!

19:43.969 --> 19:44.904
[screams]

19:56.448 --> 19:58.448
We gotta run now!

19:58.450 --> 20:00.218
Go!

20:00.220 --> 20:03.888
Welcome to Blood
Fest, mother fuckers!

20:03.890 --> 20:04.655
Guys!

20:04.657 --> 20:05.925
It's special effects!

20:05.927 --> 20:07.759
All the blood is fake!

20:07.761 --> 20:09.929
What are you running for?

20:09.931 --> 20:10.865
Oh, shit!

20:19.975 --> 20:20.874
Hey guys!

20:20.876 --> 20:22.209
I'm running from the pigheads.

20:22.211 --> 20:23.210
Not the kind you think.

20:23.212 --> 20:24.211
Not the usual kind.

20:24.213 --> 20:25.813
These have chainsaws!

20:32.188 --> 20:33.187
Hey!

20:33.189 --> 20:34.489
Come and get it!

20:36.926 --> 20:38.125
No.

20:38.127 --> 20:39.260
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

20:39.262 --> 20:40.161
No!
No!

20:40.163 --> 20:41.031
No!

20:46.669 --> 20:50.005
And remember, there's
no horror without hope!

20:50.007 --> 20:54.776
If you know the rules,
you just might make it!

20:54.778 --> 20:57.781
The rest of you are dead!

21:05.824 --> 21:07.024
Everyone's going
to the main gate.

21:07.026 --> 21:08.526
It's going to be a death trap.
This way!

21:13.900 --> 21:15.101
[screams]

21:20.140 --> 21:21.639
DAX: I can't see a thing.

21:21.641 --> 21:22.840
SAM: Found a light.

21:22.842 --> 21:23.407
Oh!

21:23.409 --> 21:24.677
Oh my God!

21:31.986 --> 21:33.219
Did you hear something?

21:33.221 --> 21:34.452
Yeah.

21:34.454 --> 21:35.288
Besides chainsaws,
death screams, and me

21:35.290 --> 21:36.991
pissing my fucking pants!

21:39.726 --> 21:41.261
No, there's something.

21:41.263 --> 21:42.762
It's over there.

21:42.764 --> 21:45.833
[suspenseful music]

21:51.106 --> 21:53.107
Wh... wh... wh... wh... wha...
wha... what are you doing?

21:53.109 --> 21:54.175
You can't open that door!

21:54.177 --> 21:55.442
It'll be like a
cat or like a rake.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.910
And then we'll all
breathe a sigh of relief.

21:56.912 --> 21:59.414
And then something will pounce
from the other direction!

21:59.416 --> 22:01.249
James Wan has made a
career on that shit, Dax!

22:01.251 --> 22:02.216
Please don't!

22:02.218 --> 22:03.117
Shut up, Krill!

22:03.119 --> 22:03.850
Please!

22:03.852 --> 22:06.923
[suspenseful music]

22:18.936 --> 22:19.635
KRILL: See?

22:19.637 --> 22:22.871
I fucking said so!

22:22.873 --> 22:23.741
Ashley!

22:31.317 --> 22:32.682
No signal.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.850
How fucking cliche is that?

22:33.852 --> 22:34.784
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

22:34.786 --> 22:35.719
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

22:35.721 --> 22:36.320
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

22:36.322 --> 22:36.920
Oh, my God!

22:36.922 --> 22:37.654
Oh, my God!

22:37.656 --> 22:39.622
And my vape's down.

22:39.624 --> 22:41.360
Perfect night.

22:41.362 --> 22:44.162
OK, let's calm
down, and let's think.

22:44.164 --> 22:45.397
There's got to be
another way out of here.

22:45.399 --> 22:48.666
The gate is locked, and
the fence is electric.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.335
There's pigs with chainsaws.

22:50.337 --> 22:51.569
We're dead!

22:51.571 --> 22:54.107
Do you think the back
gate is locked too?

22:54.109 --> 22:55.540
What back gate?

22:55.542 --> 22:58.378
Well, I got here early, and
the doors were still shut.

22:58.380 --> 23:01.114
And there was this
yellow warehouse

23:01.116 --> 23:02.848
thing with a back door.

23:02.850 --> 23:05.386
It was sealed shut, but
some guy gave me this,

23:05.388 --> 23:06.819
and it opened right up.

23:06.821 --> 23:07.687
It's not going to open now.

23:07.689 --> 23:08.588
The whole place is locked down.

23:08.590 --> 23:11.824
Hey, this a crypto-processor.

23:11.826 --> 23:13.327
We use this on Doomlarp!

23:13.329 --> 23:14.294
Doomlarp?

23:14.296 --> 23:16.030
Jesus!
Geek!

23:16.032 --> 23:17.032
Fuck!

23:17.034 --> 23:18.932
I can hack this.

23:18.934 --> 23:21.069
If you get me to the back
gate, I'll get it open.

23:21.071 --> 23:22.404
We can do this.

23:22.406 --> 23:23.937
Sorry.

23:23.939 --> 23:28.276
It's on the other side of the
grounds near the circus stuff.

23:28.278 --> 23:30.879
My God!
Fucking Clown Town!

23:30.881 --> 23:32.083
Are you fucking serious?

23:35.786 --> 23:39.821
All right, so, we are
by the main entrance.

23:39.823 --> 23:40.956
Clown Town is here.

23:40.958 --> 23:43.093
Yeah, we just gotta move quick.

23:43.095 --> 23:43.859
Stay quiet.

23:43.861 --> 23:45.362
You have flashlights?

23:45.364 --> 23:47.963
I always have flashlights.

23:47.965 --> 23:51.767
So you want to hike through
700 acres of nightmare filled

23:51.769 --> 23:54.704
with those pig fuck
butchers and any other freak

23:54.706 --> 23:57.075
that Walsh has cooked
up for the slim chance

23:57.077 --> 24:00.844
that Mr. Robot here can
hack open a back door.

24:00.846 --> 24:02.480
You got any other plans?

24:02.482 --> 24:03.814
Uh, you turds go and get help.

24:03.816 --> 24:05.716
Me and Ashley are staying
here where it's safe.

24:05.718 --> 24:06.884
What?

24:06.886 --> 24:08.387
DAX: No, we can't do that.
It's a bad idea.

24:08.389 --> 24:11.989
Wa... Walsh said
follow the rules.

24:11.991 --> 24:13.358
What rules?

24:13.360 --> 24:15.026
Dude, ru... rules of the
genre, rules of the subgenres,

24:15.028 --> 24:16.962
the tropes, the principles.

24:16.964 --> 24:19.998
Rule number one is... is
don't split up, dude.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.901
You... you seen a film before?

24:22.903 --> 24:25.003
I don't see movies.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.739
I make them.

24:27.741 --> 24:29.176
Babe, I got a signal.

24:29.178 --> 24:31.010
911 DISPATCHER (ON PHONE):
911, what's your emergency?

24:31.012 --> 24:32.513
Uh, yeah, I'm at Blood Fest.

24:32.515 --> 24:34.013
We're trapped on the
festival grounds,

24:34.015 --> 24:36.150
and people are
being slaughtered.

24:36.152 --> 24:38.818
I need immediate
assistance for two people.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.387
911 DISPATCHER (ON PHONE):
We have your location.

24:40.389 --> 24:42.290
Someone is on the way.

24:42.292 --> 24:43.592
Thank you very much.

24:43.594 --> 24:46.194
My name is Lenjamin Cain,
and I'm a film director.

24:46.196 --> 24:47.429
And I'm a celebrity.

24:47.431 --> 24:48.762
And I'm with an
up-and-coming actress, so...

24:48.764 --> 24:50.232
- Coming actress.
- I'm with the coming actress.

24:50.234 --> 24:52.334
So if that will speed things
up at all, that would be great.

24:52.336 --> 24:53.101
911 DISPATCHER (ON
PHONE): Stay calm.

24:53.103 --> 24:54.137
Remain where you are.

24:54.139 --> 24:57.275
And if you can,
go fuck yourself.

25:00.445 --> 25:01.977
What was that?

25:01.979 --> 25:03.312
911 DISPATCHER (ON PHONE): If
you are able and so inclined,

25:03.314 --> 25:07.950
put your penis between your
legs and into your anus.

25:07.952 --> 25:10.387
Then proceed to fuck yourself.

25:10.389 --> 25:11.854
And how would that help us?

25:11.856 --> 25:13.022
No one's coming.

25:13.024 --> 25:14.158
911 DISPATCHER (ON
PHONE): Oh, don't worry.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.925
Someone should be
there any moment.

Go!
Come on!

25:23.470 --> 25:24.435
Through the door!

25:24.437 --> 25:26.103
Don't rush me!

25:26.105 --> 25:28.574
Anything else I
can assist you with?

25:28.576 --> 25:31.477
Thank you for using 911.

25:31.479 --> 25:33.345
So that was a pleasant start.

25:33.347 --> 25:35.581
Billy, I want you to
double-check the outer fences,

25:35.583 --> 25:38.082

25:38.084 --> 25:40.118
Amy, let's talk Clown Town.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.222
I want to see those
freaks all riled up.

25:42.224 --> 25:43.689
They're riled up, sir.

25:43.691 --> 25:45.925
OK, make sure you catch any
call that tries to get out.

25:45.927 --> 25:47.460
But on a few of
them, play it cool.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.530
I at least put some people to
think that help is on the way.

25:50.532 --> 25:52.332
Why?

25:52.334 --> 25:56.069
I mean, doesn't it seem
kind of cruel just to give

25:56.071 --> 25:57.307
people a false sense of hope?

26:03.979 --> 26:07.349
What if I told you that
you were going to die

26:07.351 --> 26:10.586
tonight no matter what you did?

26:10.588 --> 26:13.222
What would you feel?

26:13.224 --> 26:14.523
Despair.

26:14.525 --> 26:16.858
Despair.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.395
Now what if I told
you, you had a chance

26:19.397 --> 26:23.466
but only, only if you made all
the right calls, only if you

26:23.468 --> 26:26.168
took all the right
steps, only you

26:26.170 --> 26:29.406
dug down deep inside
your soul and you

26:29.408 --> 26:34.578
found some hidden strength
you never even knew you had?

26:34.580 --> 26:35.847
How would you feel then?

26:38.284 --> 26:40.552
Motivated.

26:40.554 --> 26:42.886
Motivation.

26:42.888 --> 26:44.190
It's what every character needs.

26:47.294 --> 26:50.896
[music playing]

26:55.436 --> 26:57.969
DAX: I'm telling you, there
are rules you have to follow,

26:57.971 --> 26:59.904
like don't chant
anything in Latin.

26:59.906 --> 27:01.039
Don't get naked.

27:01.041 --> 27:02.441
Never be alone with a doll...

27:02.443 --> 27:03.509
those kinds of things.

27:03.511 --> 27:05.945
ASHLEY: These rules
are ridiculous.

27:08.450 --> 27:09.351
Let me see that badge.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.522
Yeah, I think I
should hold on this.

27:15.524 --> 27:16.591
Why?

27:16.593 --> 27:17.458
Because I don't
trust the monster squad

27:17.460 --> 27:19.092
to get us out of here alive.

27:19.094 --> 27:20.361
Are we going backwards?

27:20.363 --> 27:21.329
It's upside down.

27:21.331 --> 27:22.430
Do you trust me?

27:22.432 --> 27:26.066
Babe, no.

27:26.068 --> 27:27.602
You're an actress.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.803
All right, let's keep moving.

27:28.805 --> 27:30.539
Well, uh, wh... wh... whoa!
Wait a minute.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.006
Wait a minute.

27:32.008 --> 27:33.975
Maybe we should double-back
and find a different route.

27:33.977 --> 27:34.942
Double-back?

27:34.944 --> 27:37.379
This is a straight shot.

27:37.381 --> 27:38.846
Oh, wait.

27:38.848 --> 27:41.685
You don't think we're going
to wake the dead, you know?

27:41.687 --> 27:43.386
Like get attacked by zombies?

27:43.388 --> 27:44.354
Maybe.

27:44.356 --> 27:46.055
Are you serious?

27:46.057 --> 27:46.922
You're right.

27:46.924 --> 27:48.157
We should be really respectful.

27:48.159 --> 27:50.959
Excuse me, sir or madam,
I'm so sorry to tread

27:50.961 --> 27:52.630
on your forever resting place.

27:52.632 --> 27:53.499
[evil chuckle]

27:56.402 --> 27:58.001
Those are props.

27:58.003 --> 28:01.037
This is not a real
graveyard, OK?

28:01.039 --> 28:02.707
Do you honestly think
that Walsh wouldn't spring

28:02.709 --> 28:04.676
for real tombstones
but went ahead

28:04.678 --> 28:07.178
and got a boatload
of corpses from...

28:07.180 --> 28:09.013
God knows where you get corpses!

28:09.015 --> 28:11.115
And then he figured out
a way to animate them.

28:11.117 --> 28:13.585
And then he buried
them here in the hopes

28:13.587 --> 28:16.120
that we would come
tromping through

28:16.122 --> 28:19.091
and make a little too
much noise, wake the dead,

28:19.093 --> 28:20.660
and get attacked by zombies.

28:20.662 --> 28:23.063
Well, there's no such
thing as zombies!

28:27.402 --> 28:28.502
What?

28:28.504 --> 28:31.538
It's just... that's
usually when...

28:31.540 --> 28:33.674
when something happens to you.

28:33.676 --> 28:36.477
Like what?

28:36.479 --> 28:37.444
Ah!

28:37.446 --> 28:38.313

I'm sorry there's no
more room in here!

29:32.272 --> 29:33.472
we have a pregnant
woman in here.

29:33.474 --> 29:36.274
And, uh, we have...
actually, we have two

He's gone.

29:51.726 --> 29:52.893
He's gone.

29:52.895 --> 29:55.094
And he was going to
direct a rom-com.

up with a plan.

virgin, I'd probably

30:38.243 --> 30:39.743
You're not a virgin?

30:39.745 --> 30:43.848
The point is that no one knows
these movies better than you.

30:43.850 --> 30:46.416
So we need you to
pull it together

30:46.418 --> 30:49.721

dealing with here?

if I just tag along?

Well, it just occurs
to me that the guy

that gets left behind is
usually the next one to bite it.

34:41.808 --> 34:43.841

the Arborist's MO.

Huh, you have seen the movies.

34:45.978 --> 34:47.011

I'm going to need you to
fix that zombie transmitter.

35:08.837 --> 35:11.436
While you're at it,
add a few extra dead.

35:11.438 --> 35:13.472

35:13.474 --> 35:15.774
Sir, may I remind
you your partner

35:15.776 --> 35:19.113
didn't authorize any repairs
after the first death?

Yes, but he's
not here right now.

That is deliciously disgusting.

Oh!

How do you do all this?

35:47.477 --> 35:49.045
Like how do you get
all these participants?

35:49.047 --> 35:51.881
Oh, it took a lot of work...

35:51.883 --> 35:52.715
years of it.

35:52.717 --> 35:56.086
I found some scary people.

And the homicidal maniacs?

35:58.858 --> 36:03.793
You take a clinically damaged
mind, you force him to watch

36:03.795 --> 36:06.496
one movie continuously.

36:06.498 --> 36:12.036
Eventually, the movie mythos
becomes the man's mythos.

36:12.038 --> 36:18.010
Eventually, the movie world
becomes the man's world.

still not recovered.

botany class stays behind

take his time, like a tree.

43:27.376 --> 43:31.244
so they produce abnormal
amounts of pheromones,

43:31.246 --> 43:34.917
making them sexually
irresistible.

43:38.521 --> 43:40.622
Wow.

43:40.624 --> 43:42.524
You are really pretty.

43:42.526 --> 43:47.563
And then finally, you would
infect them with a chronic case

43:47.565 --> 43:48.998
of porphyria.

43:55.306 --> 43:57.005
Wh... what is that?

43:57.007 --> 44:00.443
It's a rare disease
resulting in insomnia,

44:00.445 --> 44:05.383
heightened sensitivity to light,
and an unquenchable thirst

44:05.385 --> 44:07.418
for blood.

44:07.420 --> 44:09.453
Is that a real thing?

44:09.455 --> 44:10.322
Look it up.

44:16.430 --> 44:19.398
[screaming]

44:19.400 --> 44:20.266
Oh.

44:24.605 --> 44:27.607
I... I'm sorry.

44:27.609 --> 44:30.777
I... I'm not going to stay.

44:30.779 --> 44:33.513
You're such a neat girl.

44:33.515 --> 44:36.582
I really would love to stay here
and maybe have sex with you.

44:36.584 --> 44:37.483
I really would.

44:37.485 --> 44:38.352
I just...

44:41.089 --> 44:43.657
You've never be with a woman.

44:43.659 --> 44:45.126
Not in person, no.

44:49.230 --> 44:53.066
Look, my friends are out
there, and they might need me.

44:53.068 --> 44:53.701
Oh!

44:53.703 --> 44:56.403
Such loyalty!

44:56.405 --> 44:59.707
Such innocence.

44:59.709 --> 45:00.742
You could come with us.

45:00.744 --> 45:03.210
I mean, maybe...
there's a way out.

45:03.212 --> 45:04.480
- No, get away.
- No, don't.

45:04.482 --> 45:05.380
- Please...
- No!

45:05.382 --> 45:07.215
Go!

45:07.217 --> 45:08.584
OK.

45:08.586 --> 45:09.485
Go!

45:09.487 --> 45:10.353
I'm sorry.

45:13.458 --> 45:14.324
I suck with girls.

45:22.634 --> 45:24.166
So here's what
you're gonna do.

45:24.168 --> 45:28.171
You are going to distract him
by pretending to be his dad.

45:28.173 --> 45:29.640
- Whose dad?
- Your dad.

45:29.642 --> 45:30.541
My dad.

45:30.543 --> 45:33.210
Yeah, his dad.

45:33.212 --> 45:38.749
He's, uh, he's a... he's a
complicated character, right?

45:38.751 --> 45:43.755
A tragic soul, a ghostly
patriarch reaching out

45:43.757 --> 45:45.791
to his troubled son.

45:45.793 --> 45:48.794
It's Hamlet's father.

45:48.796 --> 45:50.363
It's the role you
were born to play.

46:17.594 --> 46:18.461
Son.

46:25.434 --> 46:29.339
I am so... so proud of you.

46:32.175 --> 46:38.213
You have avenged me, honored me.

46:38.215 --> 46:43.654
You have ripped up all
the diseased roots.

46:43.656 --> 46:47.456
You've thrashed all the weeds.

46:47.458 --> 46:51.796
You've cleared the garden
of all the fickle growth

46:51.798 --> 46:54.366
so that a true tree may thrive!

46:56.903 --> 47:00.272
That tree is you.

47:03.343 --> 47:04.509
He's amazing.

47:04.511 --> 47:10.883
My son, you may rest now.

47:10.885 --> 47:14.385
Your work is done.

47:14.387 --> 47:15.791
Give me the trimmer.

47:25.701 --> 47:28.669
That's it.

47:28.671 --> 47:31.371
Well done, Timmy.

47:31.373 --> 47:32.840
Tommy.

47:32.842 --> 47:33.774
Tommy.

47:33.776 --> 47:34.777
[growls]

47:37.981 --> 47:41.582
Hey, tree hugger!

47:41.584 --> 47:42.583
Oh!

47:42.585 --> 47:43.852
Got it!

47:43.854 --> 47:45.453
It's sticky.
Take it.

47:45.455 --> 47:46.287
- Oh, shit.
- Dax!

47:46.289 --> 47:47.421
- Dax!
- Go, go, go!

47:47.423 --> 47:48.058
Run!

47:51.696 --> 47:52.662
Come on!
Come on!

47:52.664 --> 47:53.528
Come on!

47:53.530 --> 47:55.199
I'm going as fast as I can.

48:03.541 --> 48:04.442
[yelling]

48:13.753 --> 48:16.054
Holy... Holy shit!

48:16.056 --> 48:19.556
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
but I killed your ass!

48:19.558 --> 48:20.759
Woo!

48:20.761 --> 48:21.960
Woo!

48:21.962 --> 48:23.396
That's what I'm talking about!

48:27.300 --> 48:28.034
Woo!

48:28.036 --> 48:29.601
The virgin took him out!

48:29.603 --> 48:30.568
You're the best!

48:30.570 --> 48:31.503
Oh, hi.

48:31.505 --> 48:32.805
Hey.

48:32.807 --> 48:34.073
Are you OK?

48:34.075 --> 48:35.941
Yeah.

48:35.943 --> 48:37.177
Thank you.

48:39.815 --> 48:42.348
Hey, this goes down.

48:42.350 --> 48:43.649
So?

48:43.651 --> 48:45.886
It could be a tunnel
system for maintenance

48:45.888 --> 48:47.020
for the grounds.

48:47.022 --> 48:48.220
Do you think it's
safer down there?

48:48.222 --> 48:50.658
Would you rather be in
Blood Fest or below it?

49:02.706 --> 49:03.972
It's locked.

49:03.974 --> 49:05.941
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.376
I can unlock this.

49:08.378 --> 49:09.577
You have a lock-picking kit?

49:09.579 --> 49:10.478
You don't?

49:10.480 --> 49:11.347
Of course.

49:13.516 --> 49:17.087
That was some amazing
directing back there.

49:17.089 --> 49:20.056
Where did you get those skills?

49:20.058 --> 49:22.624
I've seen a lot of movies.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.128
And my mom, she loved
them, and especially

49:25.130 --> 49:26.730
the black and white ones.

49:26.732 --> 49:29.734
You know, Universal, Val Lewton.

49:29.736 --> 49:31.434
We used to watch them all night.

49:31.436 --> 49:32.770
Huh.

49:32.772 --> 49:34.772
Well, that is some A-plus
parenting right there.

49:34.774 --> 49:36.941
I mean...

49:36.943 --> 49:39.410
She was murdered.

49:39.412 --> 49:40.145
What?

49:40.147 --> 49:41.378
Oh, God.

49:41.380 --> 49:42.147
I'm sorry.

49:42.149 --> 49:42.748
Jesus.

49:42.750 --> 49:44.816
It's fine.

49:44.818 --> 49:51.656
You know, for a while,
I was so afraid.

49:51.658 --> 49:57.096
Everything scared me...
everything except movies.

49:57.098 --> 49:58.396
Now, movies I knew
that the blood

49:58.398 --> 50:01.801
was fake, that the daggers
were made of rubber.

50:01.803 --> 50:05.038
It was kind of like I could
play with fear, you know?

50:05.040 --> 50:07.141
I could sit in the dark
for an hour or two.

50:07.143 --> 50:08.508
I could scream, I
could jump, I could

50:08.510 --> 50:12.578
laugh and know that
everything was going to be OK.

50:12.580 --> 50:13.781
I don't know.

50:13.783 --> 50:14.848
There's something honest
about those movies.

50:14.850 --> 50:15.817
[chuckle]

50:15.819 --> 50:17.451
Honest?

50:17.453 --> 50:20.021
Those films are ridiculous!

50:20.023 --> 50:21.923
In "Arbor Day,"
"Friday the 13th,"

50:21.925 --> 50:23.792
"Halloween," it doesn't
matter where you run

50:23.794 --> 50:27.897
or where you hide, death
is always going to get you.

50:27.899 --> 50:32.634
And even if you do survive,
you'll just die in the sequel.

50:32.636 --> 50:34.870
So death is inevitable?

50:34.872 --> 50:38.007
That's the takeaway?

50:38.009 --> 50:40.543
I don't know.

50:40.545 --> 50:44.080
Gotta live while
you can, I guess.

50:44.082 --> 50:47.984
Make the most of what
little screen time you got?

50:47.986 --> 50:50.153
Is that what you do?

50:50.155 --> 50:51.390
Live life to the fullest?

50:57.596 --> 50:58.630
Not even close.

51:05.638 --> 51:08.639
Who knew Arbor Day
was so life affirming!

51:08.641 --> 51:10.010
[chuckles]

51:11.611 --> 51:12.445
KRILL: Got it.

51:15.749 --> 51:17.618
Uh, you first, Dax.

51:32.834 --> 51:33.668
Hello?

51:38.773 --> 51:40.909
Now this is pleasant.

51:40.911 --> 51:44.045
Looks like the matinee crowd.

51:44.047 --> 51:45.615
Where the hell are we?

51:48.285 --> 51:51.686
Thought I'd be
safer down here.

51:51.688 --> 51:52.787
Not safer, unsafer!

51:52.789 --> 51:54.090
We gotta turn back, Dax!

51:54.092 --> 51:57.126
No, we keep going.

51:57.128 --> 51:59.095
Tortureville leads
to Clown Town.

51:59.097 --> 52:00.930
Clowns!
Clowns!

52:00.932 --> 52:02.064
And past Clown
Town is the service

52:02.066 --> 52:03.733
gate Ashley came through.

52:03.735 --> 52:04.700
We're close.

52:04.702 --> 52:07.204
We're dead.

52:07.206 --> 52:08.804
Just don't touch anything.

52:08.806 --> 52:09.674
OK?

52:24.790 --> 52:26.257
I owe you an apology.

52:26.259 --> 52:28.559
If I hadn't hounded
you, you'd be at home

52:28.561 --> 52:30.595
right now, safe on your couch.

52:30.597 --> 52:31.829
Sam, is it
weren't for you, I'd

52:31.831 --> 52:33.631
always be at home on my couch.

52:33.633 --> 52:36.768
And I'd rather be right here...

52:36.770 --> 52:38.803
with you.

52:38.805 --> 52:41.074
MAN: Help!

52:41.076 --> 52:43.176
Guys, guys, don't...

52:43.178 --> 52:44.277
we shouldn't go that way.

52:44.279 --> 52:46.046
It could be a trap.

52:46.048 --> 52:47.613
MAN: Somebody!

52:47.615 --> 52:48.814
Help!

52:48.816 --> 52:50.951
I've seen too many
people died tonight.

52:50.953 --> 52:51.918
No more.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.886
Sam...

52:52.888 --> 52:53.988
- Hey, let's...
- Hey, Sam!

52:53.990 --> 52:54.823
Let's not...

53:02.831 --> 53:04.066
TRAPPER: Please!
Help!

53:04.068 --> 53:05.135
Somebody!

53:08.305 --> 53:09.870
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

53:09.872 --> 53:10.740
Thank you.

53:14.711 --> 53:17.846
MR. LEADFOOT: When it strikes
12, the game is through.

53:17.848 --> 53:21.184
These chains will
rip up a man in two.

53:21.186 --> 53:24.020
Please, you got to
get me out of here.

53:24.022 --> 53:24.886
But you... you worked her.

53:24.888 --> 53:26.055
You... you're a part of this.

53:26.057 --> 53:29.926
I sell fucking hot
dogs, scan bands.

53:29.928 --> 53:31.828
I wasn't even paid!

53:31.830 --> 53:33.197
I did it for a wristband.

53:33.199 --> 53:35.932
Please, help me.

53:35.934 --> 53:36.833
Wh... what do I do?

53:36.835 --> 53:38.901
Over there against the wall.

53:38.903 --> 53:40.771
There's a button in the box.

53:40.773 --> 53:41.939
OK.
I got it.

53:41.941 --> 53:43.174
You gotta hit them
at the same time.

53:43.176 --> 53:45.076
Please hurry!

53:45.078 --> 53:45.911
Ah!

53:56.190 --> 53:57.089
Sorry.

53:57.091 --> 53:57.958
What?

54:00.128 --> 54:00.961
Sam?

54:09.937 --> 54:11.670
Who the fuck is Mr. Leadfeet?

54:11.672 --> 54:12.406
Come on.

54:12.408 --> 54:15.076
In here.

54:15.078 --> 54:16.077
Hey!

54:16.079 --> 54:17.646
Hey, mother fucker!

54:20.350 --> 54:21.681
Sam, what's going on?

54:21.683 --> 54:23.016
Dax!

54:23.018 --> 54:23.950
Uh!

54:23.952 --> 54:27.356
So much blood.

54:27.358 --> 54:29.224
Ah!

54:29.226 --> 54:30.858
- Ah!
- What's happening?

54:30.860 --> 54:31.959
I traded places with him.

54:31.961 --> 54:32.794
It was dumb.

54:32.796 --> 54:33.961
It was... it was so stupid.

54:33.963 --> 54:34.831
What?

54:39.204 --> 54:40.272
Oh, shit!

54:43.841 --> 54:45.808
It won't budge!

54:45.810 --> 54:47.042
We're fucking stuck.

54:47.044 --> 54:48.111
We're stuck, Ash.

54:48.113 --> 54:50.916
We're... Ashley?

54:55.121 --> 54:57.288
We're never
getting out of here.

54:57.290 --> 54:58.489
We are.
We are!

54:58.491 --> 55:00.291
We just gotta get to
the other warehouse.

55:00.293 --> 55:02.093
And I'll use the
card to hack it.

55:02.095 --> 55:05.397
And we'll be free, I promise.

55:05.399 --> 55:08.866
Lenjamin had it.

55:08.868 --> 55:11.203
Oh, crap.

55:11.205 --> 55:12.237
Um, OK.

55:12.239 --> 55:14.306
We'll find another
way out of here.

55:14.308 --> 55:16.975
I'm gonna to die.

55:16.977 --> 55:21.481
And I can't die like this,
covered in dirt and filth

55:21.483 --> 55:25.750
and Zachary Levi's blood on me!

55:25.752 --> 55:27.722
You could always
take a shower.

55:31.360 --> 55:33.427
You're right.

55:33.429 --> 55:36.095
No, no, no, no, that's
actually not a good idea.

55:36.097 --> 55:37.131
That's just what I need.

55:37.133 --> 55:38.932
No, no, I was kidding.

55:38.934 --> 55:39.700
Ashley, please.

55:39.702 --> 55:41.136
Think about the rules.

55:41.138 --> 55:42.903
I'm sick of the rules, Krill.

55:42.905 --> 55:45.038
I'm sick of people
telling me what to do.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.940
No, no!

55:46.942 --> 55:48.909
Oh, my God.

55:48.911 --> 55:50.777
Uh, hot water.

55:50.779 --> 55:51.681
Thank God.

55:54.519 --> 55:55.251
Uh!

55:55.253 --> 55:57.486
That feels so good!

55:57.488 --> 55:58.686
Oh, oh.

55:58.688 --> 56:00.121
I thought you were
just washing your face.

56:00.123 --> 56:03.527
You know, all my life, I've
acted the way other people

56:03.529 --> 56:06.795
wanted me to act,
dressed the way

56:06.797 --> 56:10.467
other people wanted me
to dress, wasted time

56:10.469 --> 56:13.370

what I want to do.

I want to be with.

56:17.943 --> 56:18.844
Good guys.

56:22.147 --> 56:23.079
Hey, Krill?

56:23.081 --> 56:24.448
Yeah.

56:24.450 --> 56:27.319
Do you think I'm shallow?

56:27.321 --> 56:28.554
Shallow?

56:28.556 --> 56:32.089
I'm just here because
I want to be famous.

56:32.091 --> 56:33.726
How fucking shallow is that?

56:36.230 --> 56:39.965
Well, I just came
here to get laid, so...

56:39.967 --> 56:43.168
and hear... and hear you
speak at your panel.

56:43.170 --> 56:46.104
I... I like hearing you talk.

56:46.106 --> 56:48.374
I'd watch you on anything...

56:48.376 --> 56:51.378
A Tommy Wiseau movie,
a driver's ed video.

56:51.380 --> 56:54.113
I'd watch you in a
commercial for granola,

56:54.115 --> 56:55.717
and I hate granola.

Hey, Krill.

56:59.322 --> 57:01.854
Yeah?

57:01.856 --> 57:04.927
Maybe we could still make
one of our dreams come true?

Stop!

57:09.466 --> 57:10.665
OK, OK, OK, OK.

57:10.667 --> 57:11.732
We, uh, we... we gotta
call help, right?

57:11.734 --> 57:12.667
Maybe we should
trick somebody else.

57:12.669 --> 57:15.471
No, no, no, no,
I won't do that!

57:15.473 --> 57:17.273
You can't cheat time.

57:17.275 --> 57:18.974
That just won't do.

57:27.952 --> 57:28.685
OK?
I don't know!

57:28.687 --> 57:30.554
This is going to hurt!

Hey, you've got to
get them out of here.

Listen to me.

57:41.200 --> 57:42.165
I'm right here.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.166
What can I do?

57:43.168 --> 57:44.036
I'm scared.

57:50.910 --> 57:51.778
It's OK.

Oh.

No, no, no, no, no, no...

Stop.

58:01.422 --> 58:03.590
You were right.

Everybody gets a
shot at redemption.

58:07.596 --> 58:10.363
You know, I think they're going
to need another poor bastard

58:10.365 --> 58:13.333

He said it.

58:39.296 --> 58:44.166
The glorification of violence,
the over-sexualized crowds,

58:44.168 --> 58:49.271
the rampant exploration of
humanity's darkest sides...

58:49.273 --> 58:50.973
this is what horror gives us.

58:50.975 --> 58:57.450
Horror begets horror,
especially in the...

59:00.151 --> 59:02.251

Are you all right, Dr. Conway?

59:04.123 --> 59:05.189
Sorry, yeah.

59:05.191 --> 59:08.025
Just my son was
supposed to join us.

59:08.027 --> 59:10.060
I... I'm fine.

59:10.062 --> 59:13.598
Doctor, perhaps you are
exaggerating the issue?

59:13.600 --> 59:14.899

59:52.041 --> 59:54.308
Oh.

Ashley!

01:00:03.455 --> 01:00:05.287
- Where have you guys been?
- We were stuck in the bathroom.

01:00:05.289 --> 01:00:06.157
We weren't doing anything.

01:00:10.227 --> 01:00:11.795

Yeah, we got to move now.

01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:17.066
We got to get to this warehouse.

01:00:17.068 --> 01:00:17.936
About that?

01:00:20.506 --> 01:00:23.841
Lenjamin, he had the key card.

01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:25.509
And you're only
telling us now.

01:00:25.511 --> 01:00:27.344
I just thought another
solution would pop up.

01:00:27.346 --> 01:00:28.513
Don't get mad at her!

01:00:28.515 --> 01:00:29.581

All these monsters,
these nightmares...

01:00:37.223 --> 01:00:38.389
and we paid for it.

01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:39.259
We enjoy it.

01:00:42.429 --> 01:00:44.064

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.004
[evil laugh]

01:06:31.607 --> 01:06:32.606
Krill?

01:06:32.608 --> 01:06:33.574
Yeah, I'm almost there.

01:06:33.576 --> 01:06:35.243
Just wait.

01:06:35.245 --> 01:06:36.177
Krill!

01:06:36.179 --> 01:06:37.045
I got it.

01:06:37.047 --> 01:06:39.714
Just... just one more second!

01:06:39.716 --> 01:06:40.682
DAX: Krill!

01:06:40.684 --> 01:06:42.784
What?

01:06:42.786 --> 01:06:43.653
Hey.

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:47.622
It's cool.
It's cool.

01:06:47.624 --> 01:06:48.891
I know her.

01:06:48.893 --> 01:06:49.824
DAX: What?

01:06:49.826 --> 01:06:51.228
Hey.

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.029
You made it.

01:06:53.031 --> 01:06:56.933
I try to stay
away, but I couldn't.

01:06:56.935 --> 01:07:00.571
Uh, my sweet little virgin.

01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:07.146
Actually, I... never mind.

01:07:12.018 --> 01:07:14.554
You have a little something...

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.659
You... you... you got it.

01:07:21.661 --> 01:07:22.895
Run!
Run!

01:07:22.897 --> 01:07:23.896
Run!

01:07:23.898 --> 01:07:24.932
Ah!

01:07:33.308 --> 01:07:34.274
No!

01:07:34.276 --> 01:07:36.109
Krill!

01:07:36.111 --> 01:07:38.778
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.746
Oh, fuck.

01:07:39.748 --> 01:07:40.682
Oh, fuck.

01:07:51.061 --> 01:07:55.163
It didn't have to
be a wooden stake.

01:07:55.165 --> 01:07:57.898
Seemed to do the trick, bitch.

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.935
Ah!

01:07:59.937 --> 01:08:00.868
Ah!

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:01.802
Ah!

01:08:01.804 --> 01:08:03.838
Ah!

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.839
Ah!

01:08:04.841 --> 01:08:05.742
[screams]

01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:14.884
Is going to be OK, all right?

01:08:14.886 --> 01:08:17.586
Don't... don't...
don't say that.

01:08:17.587 --> 01:08:20.991
Th... that usually
means I'm dead.

01:08:20.993 --> 01:08:22.658
Oh, come on, man.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.591
Come on, Krill.

01:08:23.594 --> 01:08:24.462
We need you!

01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:32.868
Come on, man.

01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:33.904
You'll be OK.

01:08:33.906 --> 01:08:35.640
The virgin always
survives, right?

01:08:38.379 --> 01:08:42.116
Then... then I
guess I'm a dead man.

01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:01.633
ALARM SYSTEM: Access granted.

01:09:01.635 --> 01:09:02.935
It's open.

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:03.937
It's open!

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.407
[buzzing]

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.907
Oh, shit!

01:09:07.908 --> 01:09:08.908
Dad?

01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:10.310
Dax.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.479
How did you...

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.345
- Everybody's dying in here!
- It's OK.

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:12.946
It's going to be all right.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.683
Don't worry.

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:16.649
Yes!

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:17.818
You got a gun!

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.819
Dad, you' were right.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.057
You were right about everything.

01:09:22.059 --> 01:09:24.725
[muffled screams]

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:25.926
Sam!
Stop!

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.063
Shoot him!

01:09:27.064 --> 01:09:28.997
Unload the fucking clip!

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:30.299
DAX: You'll hit her.

01:09:30.301 --> 01:09:35.371
I will never do anything
that would hurt you, OK?

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:36.439
Do it.

01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:37.340
Do it!

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:38.210
Do it!

01:09:43.115 --> 01:09:44.846
DAX: What?

01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:46.183
- Dad...
- It's OK, Dax.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:47.783
You can look.
You're old enough.

01:09:47.786 --> 01:09:48.653
[gunshot]

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:51.158
OK.

01:09:54.727 --> 01:09:56.061
Jayme.

01:09:56.063 --> 01:09:58.231
This is going to take
some time to process, Dax.

01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:02.967
But I told you...

01:10:02.969 --> 01:10:04.869
I told all of you...

01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:06.472
these films, they're dangerous.

01:10:06.474 --> 01:10:08.706
They're savage.

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:09.974
But you wouldn't listen.

01:10:09.976 --> 01:10:12.178
None of you would listen!

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.945
Well, you'll listen now.

01:10:13.947 --> 01:10:15.215
They'll never make
another horror

01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:16.784
film again... not after tonight.

01:10:19.854 --> 01:10:22.255
You did this because
you hate horror movies?

01:10:22.257 --> 01:10:23.624
Horror killed my wife!

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:30.063
Horror killed your mother.

01:10:30.065 --> 01:10:35.105
So tonight, I kill horror.

01:10:39.909 --> 01:10:41.376
I'm going up to the tower.

01:10:41.378 --> 01:10:44.246
This spectacle has
gone on long enough.

01:10:44.248 --> 01:10:45.249
Take care of him.

01:10:47.984 --> 01:10:49.351
Jayme, let her go.

01:10:49.353 --> 01:10:51.154
You should've known, Dax.

01:10:51.156 --> 01:10:53.889
Dad's been planning
this for years.

01:10:53.891 --> 01:10:55.057
I've been helping.

01:10:55.059 --> 01:10:57.160
But the masks, th...
th... the killing!

01:10:57.162 --> 01:10:58.228
Dad's idea.

01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:00.396
Kind of an
experiment... you know,

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:03.766
become the thing you fear,
and you won't feel afraid.

01:11:03.768 --> 01:11:05.402
And I don't.

01:11:05.404 --> 01:11:08.139
Truth is I don't feel
much of anything.

01:11:08.141 --> 01:11:11.875
So are you going to
kill us too, or w...

01:11:11.877 --> 01:11:12.809
No.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:14.979
Maybe her.

01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:17.449
I'm kidding!

01:11:17.451 --> 01:11:19.484
But seriously, you should go.

01:11:19.486 --> 01:11:23.020
Everyone else here
is going to die.

01:11:23.022 --> 01:11:24.054
The door's unlocked.

01:11:24.056 --> 01:11:26.192
You should go.

01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:28.927
I'm going to help
Dad in the tower.

01:11:28.929 --> 01:11:30.329
Jayme, w...

01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:32.030
I know this is all...

01:11:32.032 --> 01:11:33.266
I don't know... ultraviolent.

01:11:33.268 --> 01:11:36.237
But I did warn you Blood
Fest was gonna suck.

01:11:40.808 --> 01:11:41.676
Let's go.

01:11:46.315 --> 01:11:48.080
Thank God it's Friday.

01:11:48.082 --> 01:11:49.516
TGIF.

01:11:49.518 --> 01:11:50.684
So...

01:11:50.686 --> 01:11:53.820
Maybe we could go
grab queso or something.

01:11:53.822 --> 01:11:54.955
You love queso?

01:11:54.957 --> 01:11:56.056
I love queso...

01:11:56.058 --> 01:11:57.559
all the dips.

01:11:57.561 --> 01:11:58.393
All the dips?

01:11:58.395 --> 01:12:01.094
Double-dip, triple-dip...

01:12:01.096 --> 01:12:02.030
You can handle all that?

01:12:02.032 --> 01:12:03.031
I can handle...

01:12:03.033 --> 01:12:07.001
oh, oh!

01:12:07.003 --> 01:12:09.103
What just happened?

01:12:09.105 --> 01:12:11.507
Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:12:11.509 --> 01:12:13.275
No fucking way!

01:12:13.277 --> 01:12:15.378
Oh, that was close.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.145
Hey!

01:12:16.147 --> 01:12:18.113
Open the fucking gate!

01:12:18.115 --> 01:12:20.217
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:12:20.219 --> 01:12:21.253
Fuck!

01:12:37.503 --> 01:12:38.370
I'm sorry.

01:12:38.372 --> 01:12:39.973
This is all because of my dad.

01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:50.983
OK, let's think, huh?

01:12:50.985 --> 01:12:53.353
How do horror movies end?

01:12:53.355 --> 01:12:54.320
There's got to be an answer.

01:12:54.322 --> 01:12:55.988
It doesn't matter.

01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:58.156
Some monster is going to
come out of the shadows

01:12:58.158 --> 01:13:01.294
and kill us, rip us apart.

01:13:01.296 --> 01:13:04.531
We might as well just
sit here and wait for it.

01:13:04.533 --> 01:13:07.200
OK.

01:13:07.202 --> 01:13:09.168
You know, my mom...

01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:12.205
she always used
to say that I'm...

01:13:12.207 --> 01:13:16.378
I'm stronger than
anything I'm afraid of.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.447
It's bullshit.

01:13:20.983 --> 01:13:23.217
We're going to die here.

01:13:23.219 --> 01:13:26.054
Fuck you.

01:13:26.056 --> 01:13:27.523
What?

01:13:27.525 --> 01:13:30.125
Fuck you and your dead mom.

01:13:30.127 --> 01:13:31.360
Whoa.

01:13:31.362 --> 01:13:33.529
We've gone up against
clowns and zombies,

01:13:33.531 --> 01:13:37.466
vampires, arborists, and
you're still afraid of Daddy?

01:13:37.468 --> 01:13:39.268
Check it out, Dax.

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:42.572
This is life... right now.

01:13:42.574 --> 01:13:44.341
And you can sit there
watching, or you

01:13:44.343 --> 01:13:47.176
can get up and do something.

01:13:47.178 --> 01:13:49.479
Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

01:13:49.481 --> 01:13:51.982
There's one thing these
movies have taught me...

01:13:51.984 --> 01:13:54.385
that you've taught me.

01:13:54.387 --> 01:13:56.654
It's that you can't
run away from death.

01:13:56.656 --> 01:13:57.555
So I won't.

01:13:57.557 --> 01:13:59.990
I'm going to run right at it.

01:13:59.992 --> 01:14:01.191
You want to stop Blood Fest?

01:14:01.193 --> 01:14:02.396
You stop whatever's
happening in that tower.

01:14:05.031 --> 01:14:12.471
Sam... there are three
ways a horror movie ends.

01:14:12.473 --> 01:14:15.274
One, a single hero survives...

01:14:15.276 --> 01:14:19.978
"Halloween,"
"Chainsaw," "Get Out."

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.014
Two, no one survives...

01:14:22.016 --> 01:14:25.387
"The Thing," "Sinister,"
"Night of the Living Dead."

01:14:28.223 --> 01:14:31.191
What's the third?

01:14:31.193 --> 01:14:32.027
I don't know.

01:14:35.063 --> 01:14:38.132
Let's go find out.

01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:39.468
Fuck yeah.

01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:42.539
[music playing]

01:15:14.039 --> 01:15:17.442
It's a real shit
show out there, Walsh.

01:15:17.444 --> 01:15:19.477
Uh-oh.
Doc!

01:15:19.479 --> 01:15:20.612
What are you doing here?

01:15:20.614 --> 01:15:22.680
You're the silent
partner, remember?

01:15:22.682 --> 01:15:25.717
Your goddamn festival
nearly killed my son.

01:15:25.719 --> 01:15:27.720
Your son?

01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:30.456
He's misguided.

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:33.057
Loves all this
repugnant ghoulishness.

01:15:33.059 --> 01:15:33.826
Hmm.

01:15:33.828 --> 01:15:36.495
Must run in the family.

01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:38.197
- I beg your pardon?
- Doc!

01:15:38.199 --> 01:15:39.331
Will you relax?

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:40.266
Go home!

01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:42.569
This will all be
over by morning.

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.737
What's the mortality rate?

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:44.871
I don't know.

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.673
There's maybe 100
people left alive.

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:49.108
237.

01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:50.410
Thanks, Amy!

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:52.179
Did not need that.

01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:53.581
That's too many.

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:54.649
That is too many.

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:56.416
I need to get my
family and finish this.

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:57.585
I'm pulling the plug.

01:15:57.587 --> 01:15:59.219
- I'm blowing it up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.488
Doc, Doc!

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.323
Our plan... it's rigged
to blow in the morning.

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:03.357
Come on!

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:04.626
I give you the fans!

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:06.495
I give you the filmmakers!

01:16:06.497 --> 01:16:09.397
And you give me till
dawn to make my movie!

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:11.600
And explosion is simple.
It's easy.

01:16:11.602 --> 01:16:12.801
It was part of the
original plan before you

01:16:12.803 --> 01:16:15.738
talk me into this
ridiculous exhibition.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.105
Doc, where's the fun in it?

01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:17.841
Where's the tension?

01:16:17.843 --> 01:16:19.208
Look around!

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:20.643
We've made nightmares.

01:16:20.645 --> 01:16:22.512
We've made monsters!

01:16:22.514 --> 01:16:25.214
I've seen adults on these
screens shit themselves.

01:16:25.216 --> 01:16:26.149
You...

01:16:26.151 --> 01:16:29.553
My son has been
here all night!

01:16:29.555 --> 01:16:31.387
Dax is fine!

01:16:31.389 --> 01:16:32.558
I sent him home.

01:16:35.393 --> 01:16:36.627
See?

01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:39.664
He's perfectly safe!

01:16:39.666 --> 01:16:41.298
Should've worn seatbelts.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.768
A little late for that.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:44.671
Safety first.

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:50.612
[heavy metal music playing]

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.223
[growling]

01:17:39.932 --> 01:17:41.065
Start the truck.

01:17:43.635 --> 01:17:44.834
SAM: Start the truck, Dax!

01:17:44.836 --> 01:17:45.704
I'm trying!

01:17:49.976 --> 01:17:52.743
Seatbelts.

01:17:52.745 --> 01:17:55.480
Forgive me, Father, because
I'm about to fuck this nun up!

01:17:59.886 --> 01:18:02.821
Let's do something
with a little pizazz...

01:18:02.823 --> 01:18:04.957
something a little
extraordinary.

01:18:04.959 --> 01:18:06.658
Let me do the pulse.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.359
- Walsh...
- Come on!

01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:09.460
You know you want to see it!

01:18:09.462 --> 01:18:10.194
Look, look, look.

01:18:10.196 --> 01:18:11.295
We'll do the pulse.

01:18:11.297 --> 01:18:13.633
And then... then
we'll blow it all up.

01:18:13.635 --> 01:18:15.702
No survivors.

01:18:15.704 --> 01:18:19.939
Uh, when you say,
"no survivors,"

01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:21.373
could you be a little
bit more specific?

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:24.545
You just keep editing and...
and... and save your work.

01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:29.382
What do you say?

01:18:29.384 --> 01:18:32.418
Have a little fun?

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.790
All right, well,
activate the pulse.

01:18:37.694 --> 01:18:39.094
What was the pulse again?

01:18:39.096 --> 01:18:41.528
The pulse is something I
developed at the asylum...

01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:46.868
an accident, an attempt
at a synoptic lobotomy.

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:48.770
It's a vibration that
goes through the skin,

01:18:48.772 --> 01:18:50.472
through the pulse, to the brain.

01:18:50.474 --> 01:18:51.606
It was supposed to
calm my patients.

01:18:51.608 --> 01:18:53.709
It didn't... not at all.

01:18:53.711 --> 01:18:55.745
It drove them mad.

01:18:55.747 --> 01:18:57.545
Well, weren't
they already mad?

01:18:57.547 --> 01:18:59.815
It drove them more mad!

01:18:59.817 --> 01:19:03.720
So filled with rage, they tore
each other apart before they

01:19:03.722 --> 01:19:05.488
turned on themselves.

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.556
You saved your
last cut, right?

01:19:07.558 --> 01:19:09.358
Yeah.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.293
Uh, I'm sorry.

01:19:11.295 --> 01:19:12.829
Could you go back
over that part again?

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.366
How exactly would you activate
a vibration through the pulse

01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:18.703
of every surviving...

01:19:18.705 --> 01:19:20.907
Get ready to be very angry.

01:19:24.443 --> 01:19:26.945
Wait, wait, now
wait a second here.

01:19:26.947 --> 01:19:28.047
OK?

01:19:28.049 --> 01:19:30.883
Let's not do anything
that we might...

01:19:30.885 --> 01:19:31.719
regret!

01:19:48.602 --> 01:19:51.337
Nice.

01:19:51.339 --> 01:19:52.240
Mother fucker.

01:19:56.545 --> 01:19:59.479
I'm glad I don't
have a wristband.

01:19:59.481 --> 01:20:00.682
Amy, did you see...

01:20:11.729 --> 01:20:12.728
You're right.

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:14.331
It's very entertaining.

01:20:19.738 --> 01:20:21.305
We're close to the tower.

01:20:33.018 --> 01:20:35.685
What's... what's
wrong with them?

01:20:35.687 --> 01:20:38.655
They're not...
they're not monsters.

01:20:38.657 --> 01:20:40.259
It's like they're possessed.

01:20:51.105 --> 01:20:52.104
Sam!

01:20:52.106 --> 01:20:53.172
Sam!

01:20:53.174 --> 01:20:54.106
Sam!

01:20:54.108 --> 01:20:54.942
Come on!

01:21:03.952 --> 01:21:06.552
ALARM SYSTEM: Tower breach.

01:21:06.554 --> 01:21:08.721
Tower breach.

01:21:08.723 --> 01:21:09.790
Tower breach.

01:21:09.792 --> 01:21:11.191
Oh, I love it when
they fight back!

01:21:11.193 --> 01:21:12.660
ALARM SYSTEM: Tower breach.

01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:21.670
You're gonna be OK.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:31.512
Hey!

01:21:31.514 --> 01:21:32.348
Come on!

01:22:01.982 --> 01:22:02.981
Dad?

01:22:02.983 --> 01:22:04.015
Dad!

01:22:04.017 --> 01:22:05.716
Just let them all
kill themselves.

01:22:05.718 --> 01:22:07.618
It's Dax.

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:22:09.622 --> 01:22:11.890
You said I was made
for Blood Fest.

01:22:11.892 --> 01:22:13.825
It's not true.

01:22:13.827 --> 01:22:14.929
I was made for you.

01:22:20.767 --> 01:22:21.870
I think I love...

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:29.111
Thought that would work.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:35.550
Sam, wa... wa... wa... wa... wait.

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:49.030
You did this!

01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:52.867
Do you have one sliver
of self-awareness?

01:22:52.869 --> 01:22:54.236
You helped birth all of this!

01:22:54.238 --> 01:22:57.172
Half the monsters
are your patients!

01:22:57.174 --> 01:22:59.208
And Doc, if you haven't
looked in the mirror lately,

01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:01.710
you're looking a little
bloodthirsty yourself.

01:23:01.712 --> 01:23:02.946
You're right.

01:23:02.948 --> 01:23:04.780
I am a little bloodthirsty.

01:23:04.782 --> 01:23:05.781
OK.

01:23:05.783 --> 01:23:06.817
Dad!

01:23:10.554 --> 01:23:11.754
Dax.

01:23:11.756 --> 01:23:12.488
Dad, stop whatever
it is you're doing.

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:13.189
You're killing her!

01:23:13.191 --> 01:23:14.091
Don't worry, son.

01:23:14.093 --> 01:23:16.260
It will all be over very soon.

01:23:16.262 --> 01:23:17.128
We'll get out of here.

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:18.296
No one will know we're here.

01:23:18.298 --> 01:23:20.932
He's filmed himself
doing everything...

01:23:20.934 --> 01:23:21.765
everything.

01:23:21.767 --> 01:23:23.234
He'll take all the credit.

01:23:23.236 --> 01:23:26.671
And then we'll walk out of
here, blow the whole place up,

01:23:26.673 --> 01:23:28.974
and we'll be a happy family.

01:23:28.976 --> 01:23:30.309
Let's not blow
it up quite yet.

01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:32.843
I still need my
ending... something big!

01:23:32.845 --> 01:23:34.246
Something I didn't
expect coming!

01:23:34.248 --> 01:23:35.746
How's this?

01:23:35.748 --> 01:23:36.616
See?

01:23:39.254 --> 01:23:42.854
There's no need for
re-animated corpses

01:23:42.856 --> 01:23:45.791
or blood-sucking clowns!

01:23:45.793 --> 01:23:46.960
All you need is a gun...

01:23:46.962 --> 01:23:50.230
just one God damn gun!

01:23:50.232 --> 01:23:50.930
Dad!

01:23:50.932 --> 01:23:52.299
Stop right there.

01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:54.101
I'm not going anywhere.

01:23:54.103 --> 01:23:58.805
I'm gonna stay here and save
my friend and my sister.

01:23:58.807 --> 01:24:01.276
And if I get out of
this place alive,

01:24:01.278 --> 01:24:03.378
I'm telling the whole
world what you really are.

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:06.613
Every time I look in your
eyes, all I see is fear.

01:24:06.615 --> 01:24:09.184
Well, there won't be anything
to be afraid of anymore, Dax.

01:24:09.186 --> 01:24:11.785
The only thing I was
ever afraid of was you!

01:24:11.787 --> 01:24:13.356
Stop right there, Dax.

01:24:13.358 --> 01:24:14.290
Right now.

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:15.224
No.

01:24:15.226 --> 01:24:17.994
Mom was right.

01:24:17.996 --> 01:24:21.629
I'm stronger than
anything I'm afraid of...

01:24:21.631 --> 01:24:22.532
including you.

01:24:27.406 --> 01:24:28.040
Ah!

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:32.277
I can't let you die...

01:24:35.347 --> 01:24:39.649
unless I die with you.

01:24:39.651 --> 01:24:40.385
Dad...

01:24:40.387 --> 01:24:41.254
Yes.

01:24:44.957 --> 01:24:48.292
I'm going to end
this God damn farce.

01:24:48.294 --> 01:24:49.195
[growling]

01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:53.265
It's for the best.

01:24:53.267 --> 01:24:55.234
Honestly.

01:24:55.236 --> 01:24:58.671
Dad... Dad, no.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.935
Here we go.

01:25:34.877 --> 01:25:35.643
It's OK.

01:25:35.645 --> 01:25:37.380
Let's figure this out!

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:38.249
Sam!

01:25:41.819 --> 01:25:43.119

01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:44.721
Try the wristband.

01:25:58.002 --> 01:26:00.903
You're covered in black vomit.

01:26:00.905 --> 01:26:02.307
I don't mind.

01:26:02.309 --> 01:26:03.176
It's yours.

01:26:16.224 --> 01:26:18.259
A "thank you"
would be appreciated.

01:26:24.298 --> 01:26:28.368
You know, Sis, you, uh,
you killed a number of people

01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:29.336
tonight.

01:26:29.338 --> 01:26:30.403
Yeah.

01:26:30.405 --> 01:26:31.304
Phew!

01:26:31.306 --> 01:26:34.341
I mean, murder.

01:26:34.343 --> 01:26:36.443
Horrible.

01:26:36.445 --> 01:26:38.446
Lesson learned.

01:26:38.448 --> 01:26:40.814
I think maybe they're
going to send you somewhere.

01:26:40.816 --> 01:26:41.982
Uh-huh.

01:26:41.984 --> 01:26:44.220
Maybe get some good
psychiatric help.

01:26:49.193 --> 01:26:50.791
Jesus Christ, Sis!

01:26:50.793 --> 01:26:52.128

So is this the third
way a horror movie ends?

01:27:11.048 --> 01:27:11.980
Classic.

01:27:51.227 --> 01:27:54.228
You think anyone survived?

01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:56.298
Maybe there's a chance.

01:28:07.142 --> 01:28:09.277
Never mind.

01:28:09.279 --> 01:28:11.078
No.
