00:02.569 --> 00:04.242
[passengers screaming]

00:05.138 --> 00:06.310
(Dominic) Nothing, String.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.751
Not on our radar and not on our infrared.

00:08.809 --> 00:12.655
(Hergos) One 747 and 100 or so
assorted American citizens.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.319
$50 million for the package or they're dead.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.852
You pay and you'll probably never
see any of those people again.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.657
[passengers screaming]

00:25.325 --> 00:26.599
Somethings wrong.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.504
That rocket tore up our
pods. Everything's jammed.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:58.218 --> 01:59.788
Are we on course?

01:59.853 --> 02:01.161
Which course?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.394
The one we bounced off a second ago?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.562
Or the one we're bouncing around on?

02:05.626 --> 02:08.436
Or the one that we're about to slam into now?

02:13.233 --> 02:14.940
National Weather,

02:15.535 --> 02:17.742
this is Special Survey 3.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.543
We're at a heading of 056 over Cabo San Martin.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.088
Hurricane Kim is unstable.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.215
Winds, 100 knots.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.427
Drift right degree 40 at 8,000.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.985
Do you read?

02:31.084 --> 02:33.223
(man on radio) Special
Survey 3. Loud and clear.

02:33.286 --> 02:36.165
You guys come on in. We got the toddies hot.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.433
That's a big thanks.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.233
We're a little late for a wedding.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.534
Hey, you do a great job on these emergencies.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.906
How come we never see you?

02:45.032 --> 02:47.808
'Cause we're too modest to accept. Out.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.704
[laughing]

03:04.084 --> 03:05.961
Mom, I said I'm com’n.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.564
No, I told you, I'm com’n alone.

03:08.755 --> 03:12.635
Mom, I'm sorry. There is no Mr. Right just yet.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.367
No, no, it's not Daddy's fault
for teaching me how to fly.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.176
Mom, a lot of girls fly.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.603
Who?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.671
The Flying Nun, Wonder Woman, Peter Pan.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.984
Okay, I know Peter Pan was a boy.
But Sandy Duncan played him.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.478
Mom, I'll be there, all right?

03:31.545 --> 03:34.856
Mom, I know I can't have a
baby with a helicopter, okay?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.892
Goodbye.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.590
Caitlin, your plane leaves in an hour.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.093
You know what?

03:41.154 --> 03:44.192
I think it's real unfair
for me to walk out on my job

03:44.257 --> 03:45.736
for some personal event.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.066
Personal?

03:47.194 --> 03:48.935
Your sister's getting married.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.668
Well, whose fault is that?

03:54.501 --> 03:57.038
You check the Ranger. I'll get her dressed.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.909
Well, you know, figuratively speaking.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.462
(Designer) I always see my own
girls off to a fashion show

04:13.520 --> 04:15.591
regardless of where it is.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.868
After all, they're my rags

04:19.091 --> 04:22.505
and I want them hung from my bones.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.201
Voila.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.543
(woman on PA) Attention. All
passengers on Trans Pacific Airlines

04:30.604 --> 04:33.210
flight 322 for Portland and Seattle…

04:33.273 --> 04:35.150
What do you think, Ingrid?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.552
What does your crystal ball say?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.885
We're a small airline,

04:41.281 --> 04:44.626
but after you get finished telling
those bankers in Dallas what for,

04:44.684 --> 04:46.288
we'll be a big airline.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.697
All we need is $100 million.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.563
Edward,

04:52.058 --> 04:55.528
they say airports are a place
where people say things

04:55.896 --> 04:58.399
because they're forced to say them quickly.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.635
Oh? Yeah?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.172
And I…

05:02.335 --> 05:03.336
Huh?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.214
Well, I…

05:07.374 --> 05:09.445
This is a momentous occasion.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.386
Ingrid Kendall is at a loss for words.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.157
Well, I…

05:16.349 --> 05:18.852
I just wanted to say, I
know you'll get the money.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.455
If anybody can…

05:22.923 --> 05:25.267
You're very good for me, Ingrid.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.865
I don't know what I'd do without you.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.238
No need to find out.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.441
Would you stop shoving me?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.881
- You'll miss your plane.
- Wouldn't that be too bad?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.941
- Caitlin, you're going to that wedding.
- Yeah.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.578
I don't know why I have to go to Texas
to be told what's wrong with me.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.680
- I could stay at Santini Air.
- (Stringfellow) Yeah.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.156
[beeping]

05:47.247 --> 05:49.090
Empty your pockets, please.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.623
(woman on PA) Passenger Joel Geiderman,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.565
passenger Joel Geiderman,

05:56.623 --> 05:58.864
Pacific Airlines flight 3, please
pick up a white courtesy telephone.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.233
[beeping]

06:04.497 --> 06:07.671
Trans Pacific flight 188 to Honolulu,

06:07.734 --> 06:09.475
departing gate 9.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.280
Trans Pacific Airlines flight…

06:12.339 --> 06:14.649
Hey, you do and I'll bite.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.322
What are these things?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.020
Wedding presents.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.596
She's a Texan.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.797
Thanks.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.537
Come on, guys, don't make me go.

06:36.596 --> 06:37.904
Ah, you'll love it.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.602
Sure, you just take care.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.340
(Stewardess) Welcome, everyone.
We have good news for you.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.211
Our weather is improving.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.750
Please follow me.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.150
- Okay, here.
- Okay, thanks.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.882
- (Dominic) Bye. Bye-bye.
- (Caitlin) Okay.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.184
Excuse me.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.315
Excuse me.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.223
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.099
First class? Straight around to the front.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.664
This way, please.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.471
- (Attendant) Straight down…
- Not bad.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.613
Excuse me.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.782
- Any time. What's your name?

07:26.713 --> 07:28.556
- Could you move?
- What's the rush?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.288
We're both gonna get there at the same time.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.159
- My name's Mark.
- Do you know karate?

07:32.218 --> 07:34.664
- What?
- I give free samples.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.594
Thanks.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.235
I'm sorry.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.002
That's all right, dear.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.737
I'm here.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.536
Oh.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.310
See, I'm goin’ to my sister's wedd’n.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.218
And I've got knick-knacks for just
about everybody who's ever heard of me

07:57.277 --> 07:59.154
ever since I was born.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.087
Is this your first flight, honey?

08:02.349 --> 08:03.726
(Hergos) Excuse me.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.456
You're kind of last minute, don't you think?

08:05.518 --> 08:07.293
Gotta check the microwave for a leak.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.958
I just work here.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.398
(Stewardess) Your seat's right
up this way, sweetheart.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.114
[beeping]

08:57.303 --> 08:59.977
(Stewardess) Welcome aboard
flight 093 to Dallas.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.884
Your Captain has requested that
your seat belts be fastened

09:02.942 --> 09:05.855
and that all seat-backs and trays
be in an upright position,

09:05.912 --> 09:07.448
prepared for takeoff.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.425
Please extinguish all smoking materials

09:09.482 --> 09:12.361
until the Captain has turned
off the no-smoking sign.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.899
Please watch the Flight Attendant
at the front of your cabin,

09:14.954 --> 09:16.934
as she points out the emergency exits

09:16.990 --> 09:20.164
which are located at the front
and rear of the cabin areas.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.832
If there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure,

09:22.896 --> 09:26.309
an oxygen mask will fall from
the ceiling above your seat.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.642
Place the mask over your nose and mouth,

09:28.701 --> 09:32.478
bring the strap over your head and
tighten, and breathe normally.

09:32.539 --> 09:36.009
Your life vest is located in
a container under your seat.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.987
Place the vest over your head,

09:38.044 --> 09:40.615
tighten by pulling the 2 straps as shown.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.126
We hope you enjoy your flight to Dallas.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.356
We look forward to serving you.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.038
You know how break dancing came about?

10:01.501 --> 10:05.381
Some kid tried to steal
hubcaps off a moving car.

10:10.477 --> 10:14.186
But that doesn't take away
from you doing your taxes.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.385
They never even called me.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.090
String, we got the same accountant.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.259
And he says you're gonna go
to jail if you don't file.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.928
Just a lot of paperwork.

10:25.992 --> 10:29.804
And he's flying up a special
accountant just to save your neck.

10:29.863 --> 10:30.967
Special, huh?

10:31.030 --> 10:32.976
Somebody good with puzzles.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.443
[Dominic laughing]

10:41.908 --> 10:45.822
I expect to be a Mother one day.
I hope to be a good one.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.515
Do all Mothers and daughters argue so much?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.788
It's part of life, I guess.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.922
I just don't know what upsets her.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.864
I mean, I don't know what's wrong with me.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.663
You seem very nice.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.303
See, she's always throw’n my sister in my face.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.534
She says we're so different.
But I really don't see where.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.837
You see, my sister went to
school, and I went to school.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.709
My sister dated lots of
guys, but then so did I.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.806
Now my sister works for an
insurance company, and I'm work’n.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.942
Well, I guess we're all the same.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.181
I didn't sleep till my
own daughters were married.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.354
Just what is it you do, dear?

11:19.412 --> 11:21.016
I'm a helicopter pilot.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.252
Oh!

11:22.315 --> 11:23.988
Well I mean, it's no big deal.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.428
I fly movie stunts, do a little crop-dusting,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.659
border hops, that kind of thing.

11:29.822 --> 11:30.823
Oh!

11:43.503 --> 11:44.675
Let's go.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.490
There has been some concern about
Hurricane Kim, but so far so good.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.160
The storm is exhausting itself out at sea.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.431
We expect a comfortable flight.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.329
(Hijacker) Okay everybody, stay calm.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.830
(Pilot) Hey, what's going on?

12:42.562 --> 12:46.305
(Accountant) I'm in accounting because
it's a neat, organized profession.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.572
Direct.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.836
Actually, very uncomplicated.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.041
1 and 1 always makes 2.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.477
Why are you crossing that out?

12:57.577 --> 13:00.581
Dry-cleaning your personal clothes
is not a business deduction.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.685
Hey, it was a client. He
regurgitated on my pants

13:03.750 --> 13:05.127
when we hit an air pocket.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.357
Well, you clean your suits anyway.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.565
I wouldn't even wear suits
if Dom didn't insist on it.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.230
Oh, the rest of the time you fly in the nude?

13:14.294 --> 13:17.036
You must be very popular in some quarters.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.570
So, what about these?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.706
I need the stubs.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.978
But you know, I really
don't need them right now.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.747
I need a break.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.084
Could I have something to drink?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.682
Coffee? Tea? Juice?

13:35.381 --> 13:36.553
Vodka?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.532
Sorry you had to get stuck doing these taxes

13:45.591 --> 13:47.229
on such a short notice.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.100
Well, Santini and my boss are friends.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.472
I saw you at our office
one day, so I volunteered.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.638
[helicopter whirring]

13:57.837 --> 13:59.339
It's just tourists, they fly over.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.713
[whimpering]

14:01.074 --> 14:02.451
They'll be gone.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.255
This is a lovely place.

14:06.646 --> 14:07.989
Thank you.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.120
Thanks.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.927
Kind of a hideaway?

14:14.987 --> 14:16.364
String!

14:16.422 --> 14:18.026
Hey, String!

14:18.224 --> 14:19.828
Where are you, String?

14:20.893 --> 14:21.963
Hi.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.805
Go down to 700 feet and take a heading of 190.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.318
You know, you're gonna kill us all.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.389
For $50 mill, it's one hell of a crap-shoot.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.832
(Air Traffic Controller) Flight
093, your signal is weak.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.765
Okay, take out the radio.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.350
(Air Traffic Controller)
Flight 093, come in, please.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.585
Flight 093, come in, please.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.268
It's no use, he's off my scope.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.643
Oh, my,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.712
aren't those waves large?

15:43.976 --> 15:46.547
We're too low. Fasten your seat belts.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.693
Fasten your seat belts. Put it on.

15:51.517 --> 15:52.689
Captain?

15:53.319 --> 15:54.593
Captain?

15:54.654 --> 15:56.463
Bobby, what's going on?

15:56.522 --> 15:57.694
(Hijacker) Ladies and gentlemen,

15:57.757 --> 16:00.397
I would like to announce
that this is a hijacking.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.031
Relax, enjoy your experience,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.606
and pray that your ransom is paid.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.434
For now, buckle up.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.741
We're about to land on the water.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.077
Okay everybody, just stay calm.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.616
[passengers screaming]

16:43.703 --> 16:44.943
It's okay.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.545
Mommy, Mommy!

16:49.408 --> 16:51.081
It's all right, dear.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.187
It's okay.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.862
Take it easy. Take it easy.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.062
[passengers chattering]

17:07.359 --> 17:08.862
We're sinking.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.471
We're sinking!

17:48.234 --> 17:49.770
[seagulls cawing]

17:55.274 --> 17:58.380
(Announcer) Investigators of the Los
Angeles area are currently looking into

17:58.444 --> 18:01.118
the strange disappearance
and subsequent ransom demand

18:01.180 --> 18:04.684
of flight 093 from LAX bound for Dallas.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.697
The plane carried 156 passengers,

18:07.753 --> 18:09.630
among them, the Airline's President.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.794
Search operations are underway.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.564
Next, Barney Cabral with sports.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.730
They're down.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.137
We did it.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.333
Yeah.

18:26.505 --> 18:27.575
[crying] Oh, my God.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.746
We're gonna be fine. It's all
right. Everything's fine.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.686
Everything’s okay.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.258
[sobbing]

18:41.287 --> 18:44.700
Hey, hey, hey, you know what? They're
gett’n out of hand out there.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.361
I'm scared.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.170
I'm scared.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.299
Now you can't be, because that's not your job.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.976
Okay.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.991
Everyone please, please, don't panic.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.825
We are all right.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.893
You can be sure that rescue
operations are already underway.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.097
She's right.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.835
This plane can maintain its
integrity underwater indefinitely.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.902
What do you know?

19:27.066 --> 19:29.876
My name is Johnson, sir. I'm
Vice President of this airline.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.471
We don't need lies.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.915
Hey, we doth need a party pooper.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.145
Right?

19:38.511 --> 19:42.152
Come on guys, do I have to say
we're all in this together?

19:46.385 --> 19:48.797
(man) Pain in my leg. I can't move.

19:50.489 --> 19:51.797
Thanks.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.803
[sonar beeping]

20:13.012 --> 20:14.457
[buzzing]

20:16.982 --> 20:18.393
Yeah, we got it.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.762
His leg got cut. It won't stop bleeding.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.269
Give me some napkins.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.206
Can somebody help us?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.000
Is there a Doctor onboard?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.907
I'll get the first-aid kit.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.774
Hey you, come here, come here. You're elected.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.439
I need your thumb.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.109
Good, good, good. Right there.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.344
Like that?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.818
Yeah. You okay?

20:43.876 --> 20:46.652
Yeah, I'm all right, thanks.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.821
We've got something I want you to hear.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.627
(Hergos) We are not greedy men.

21:01.794 --> 21:06.743
One 747 and 100 or so assorted American
citizens, man, woman and child.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.037
$50 million for the package.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.377
Prepare the money, any denominations.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.007
Wait for our next call.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.450
Play it straight or they're dead.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.082
Tony, thanks for lett’n us in.

21:20.146 --> 21:24.526
No problem you guys, just
keep a low profile, all right?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.362
What really has us up a tree is the fact

21:27.419 --> 21:30.263
that even a downed plane can
be spotted by a satellite.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.603
This plane is gone, vanished.

21:33.659 --> 21:35.866
What about an abandoned airstrip?

21:35.928 --> 21:37.771
Could it be camouflaged?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.400
There are just so many airstrips en-route

21:39.465 --> 21:42.002
large enough to handle a plane that size.

21:42.067 --> 21:46.345
Why are we talking? It has
to be down somewhere by now.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.951
It could take days to raise the money.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.214
We'd better start.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.755
You gonna pay?

21:52.378 --> 21:54.051
What's our choice?

21:54.213 --> 21:55.851
You wanna get cute now

21:55.915 --> 21:59.453
and play FBI with a bunch of
who-knows-what-kind of lunatics?

21:59.518 --> 22:03.762
You pay and you'll probably never
see any of those people again.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.694
[phone ringing]

22:08.127 --> 22:09.128
Hey.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.814
You're right, of course.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.711
You know, I have a friend on that plane, too.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.253
We've been together 11 years.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.619
I fell in love with him the day we met.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.655
But I never told him.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.433
He was married and had children.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.268
When his wife died,

22:42.995 --> 22:44.668
I cried too.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.171
Then I told myself,

22:48.234 --> 22:49.542
“Ingrid,”

22:50.002 --> 22:52.676
“it's been a respectable amount of time.”

22:53.038 --> 22:54.711
“Now you'll tell him.”

22:57.109 --> 22:58.782
But I never did.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.705
Hey, don't blow that window.
You'll drown us all.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.402
[explosion]

23:17.463 --> 23:19.067
[passengers screaming]

23:20.299 --> 23:21.710
(woman) Oh, no!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.345
(man) There's water coming in.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.774
(woman) This is terrible.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.114
We're filling up.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.654
We won't fill up.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.587
No, no, no, we're pressurized.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.717
Well, look at it! We're breaking apart.

23:35.781 --> 23:36.782
Would you shut up?

23:45.858 --> 23:47.337
Hey, we did it!

23:47.393 --> 23:48.428
There.

23:48.494 --> 23:49.495
Yeah.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.371
[hooting]

24:02.308 --> 24:03.685
Oh, no.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.551
Maybe they'll go away, huh?

24:06.578 --> 24:07.784
Can't let it,

24:08.113 --> 24:11.583
not when all the evidence against
us is buried on the bottom.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.393
[hooting]

24:46.719 --> 24:48.357
(Hijacker) Great shot!

24:48.420 --> 24:49.524
Thanks!

25:00.699 --> 25:02.474
Now nobody knows!

25:07.806 --> 25:10.013
- We've just gotten some bad news.
- Oh?

25:10.709 --> 25:12.586
The storm's swinging north.

25:12.644 --> 25:16.524
If it gets any closer, we'll have
to call the search planes back in.

25:16.582 --> 25:19.085
Not a trace, noth’n to check out.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.097
Nobody even has a hunch.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.292
Where the devil could it be?

25:25.824 --> 25:27.428
Come on, let's go.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.602
Listen.

25:33.132 --> 25:36.511
They may have to call off
the search, but we don't.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.107
Hey.

25:38.437 --> 25:40.747
Our baby doesn't mind a little rough weather,

25:40.806 --> 25:42.808
not with Caitlin out there.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.591
Oh hey, what the heck. Go ahead and eat up.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.898
Have a grand time. It's on
the airline. No charge.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.334
We're all gonna die here.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.035
Coffee, tea, chateaubriand for 2?

26:06.098 --> 26:08.601
What are you doing? Sir stop, no!

26:08.667 --> 26:11.079
If we heard a boat before,
we couldn't be that deep.

26:11.136 --> 26:12.410
Hey, hey…

26:13.705 --> 26:15.742
now it's okay, everything's all right.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.617
Everything's gonna be…

26:19.778 --> 26:21.155
everything's gonna be fine.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.215
Just give me that knife.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.358
[sighs]

26:35.160 --> 26:36.366
You okay?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.429
Yeah.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.823
(Dominic) Nothing, String.

26:55.914 --> 26:59.623
Not on our radar and not on our infrared.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.229
Are you getting any pictures?

27:01.286 --> 27:02.492
Plenty.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.061
Let's take her up.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.663
Turbos.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.039
Oops!

27:12.097 --> 27:13.804
Forget the turbos.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.276
Nature just lent us her elevator.

27:32.084 --> 27:36.032
Well, for whatever it'll get us, it's
a look no one else will ever get.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.398
Running cameras through
weather over large areas

27:38.457 --> 27:39.993
with our kind of equipment.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.060
How's the weather ahead?

27:42.127 --> 27:43.629
Worse, if anything.

27:43.695 --> 27:45.197
No let up.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.505
(man on radio) Flight 093, this
is Coast Guard Weather Patrol.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.638
All call in.

27:50.702 --> 27:52.113
There it is.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.516
Don't answer it.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.211
You'd better ID.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.454
Coast Guard Patrol, this is Ranger 276.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.959
Ranger what?

28:04.016 --> 28:05.461
Helicopter.

28:05.517 --> 28:09.192
The hell you say, we
clocked you doin’ 800 knots.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.631
We have a tailwind.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.999
A tailwind?

28:13.058 --> 28:14.435
What's the problem?

28:14.493 --> 28:17.372
That big storm is the worst. Can't
make up its mind where it's go’n.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.340
Right now, it's com’n your way fast.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.344
You're ordered to call off
the search for a while.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.572
"Tailwind"?

28:22.634 --> 28:25.638
Well, we've got a friend
aboard. We gotta keep going.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.012
You've been ordered to come in.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.416
We don't want to end up
search’n for 2 miss’n craft.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.613
What are you still doing out there?

28:36.481 --> 28:37.824
[static crackling]

28:38.750 --> 28:41.162
Hello? Are you there?

28:42.254 --> 28:43.733
Can you read me?

28:59.438 --> 29:01.850
(Announcer) All attempts to
locate the 747 have failed

29:01.907 --> 29:04.285
because of worsening weather conditions.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.653
I never demanded, I swear.
I just said, "Get it."

29:08.747 --> 29:11.057
They just called off the search.

29:11.116 --> 29:13.221
They'd never find it anyway.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.958
This time tomorrow we're gonna have
more cash than most countries.

29:16.021 --> 29:20.060
And all the evidence against us
is under 30 fathoms forever.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.531
Cool.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.609
(Caitlin) And so he took a deep, deep breath,

29:28.667 --> 29:32.205
and he huffed and he puffed
and he puffed and he huffed,

29:32.271 --> 29:35.081
but he couldn't blow down
the house made of stone.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.211
(girl) Were you really a policeman?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.051
Now, I said I was, didn't I?

29:39.111 --> 29:41.921
I was a policewoman. Ladies can be police.

29:41.980 --> 29:45.257
They teach you how to knock
down a man like that?

29:45.317 --> 29:47.092
Only if you have to.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.924
I have this brother

29:51.556 --> 29:53.263
who's mean to me.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.771
- Mmm-hmm.
- And you wanna knock him down?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.540
I bet you do.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.435
[creaking]

30:03.635 --> 30:05.273
(man) Why are we moving?

30:05.737 --> 30:07.341
Look, the water is back.

30:30.028 --> 30:33.407
I'm look’n and I'm look’n
and I can't see anything.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.542
You know,

30:44.042 --> 30:45.885
I know where they are.

30:47.512 --> 30:48.957
What's this?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.459
Oh, my God.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.661
[passengers chattering]

31:13.538 --> 31:15.176
(man) We've got to do
something, we can't just…

31:17.175 --> 31:19.121
I've got another one over here.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.516
They're all alike.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.094
I'm afraid the plane has shifted its weight,

31:27.052 --> 31:28.861
popped some rivets,

31:29.821 --> 31:32.267
separated some plates.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.103
Just enough.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.873
(Caitlin) Is there any
way to get at ‘em to fix?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.076
Nah.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.948
How long until the plane fills up?

31:51.076 --> 31:52.453
I'd say

31:53.645 --> 31:55.750
we can last a few more hours.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.123
Hey, we're hang’n in there.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.929
- Can we help?
- Anything we can do?

32:04.990 --> 32:06.230
Yeah, smile.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.430
Put on a happy face, sing happy songs,

32:08.493 --> 32:11.235
and if all else fails, put on your bikinis.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.776
You know, this is gett’n downright boring.

32:13.832 --> 32:16.005
At least there's good company.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.113
We're not getting out of here.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.983
Hey, you wanna bet? 5’ll get you 10.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.715
Now, put up or shut up.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.789
It's okay.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.500
(Stringfellow) The plane never
put down along this route.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.596
It went off radar right here,
where it changed course.

32:42.661 --> 32:43.935
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

32:44.029 --> 32:46.475
Right into the mountains, here.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.641
That's what we thought at first.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.543
But they didn't go to the mountains.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.774
Well, the rest of it's just… just water.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.945
Right here, look at this photo. It's infrared.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.456
Yeah, but it's just shadows.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.091
That is the silhouette of an airplane.

33:03.949 --> 33:06.156
You mean they went down at sea?

33:08.153 --> 33:10.030
Well, it's all over then. They're all dead.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.624
(Dominic) Not so fast.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.636
That plane looks intact.

33:13.692 --> 33:17.265
If it is, there's no reason why
those people wouldn't be alive.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.572
Well, we've got a break in
the weather. We got a chance.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.043
We're gonna go check it out.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.807
Please, let it be.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.773
Yeah, we'll… we’ll radio back.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.954
Wait, wait, wait.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.449
You guys said you had a plane
that could see underwater with?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.117
Do you mind if I tell that to the press?

33:36.181 --> 33:39.594
No, just say it's some special equipment
we're testing for the military.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.255
- Special equipment?
- Yeah.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.491
Right.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.359
Right.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.772
Coast Guard Rescue.

33:54.900 --> 33:58.143
(Hergos) It was on the radio. Coast
Guard thinks they've spotted a plane.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.944
Maybe we should forget about it, man.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.110
They're never supposed to find that plane.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.516
We gotta get out of here.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.111
We gotta get outta the country.

34:05.176 --> 34:08.646
What, from $50 mill, we
don't get back gas money?

34:08.746 --> 34:10.226
Take the wheel.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.056
- We gotta destroy the evidence.
- Evidence?

34:12.117 --> 34:14.027
Those people are dead one
way or the other, man.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.121
There's no way they can ID anybody.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.893
They send divers down,

34:17.956 --> 34:19.697
and they remove the bodies.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.396
And they find out that 4 guys are missing.

34:21.458 --> 34:24.440
And they start to check
it out and they get to us.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.134
Man, this was perfect.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.870
We are gonna blow that plane out of the water.

34:28.934 --> 34:32.472
And the next time we pull this
job, they'll pay and fast.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.544
(Stringfellow) Well?

35:01.866 --> 35:03.504
(Dominic) Noth’n yet.

35:03.635 --> 35:07.378
And we're as close as we can
locate from those infrared photos.

35:09.174 --> 35:11.484
If we're right, it's gotta be here.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.954
Where else can it be?

35:13.011 --> 35:14.718
Are we on coordinates?

35:14.879 --> 35:16.950
String, don't get your hopes up.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.426
Our chances of finding them…

35:18.483 --> 35:19.791
All right, just check’n.

35:20.318 --> 35:22.924
She's miss’n her sister's wedding.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.397
Try those scanners again.

35:27.592 --> 35:28.969
Okay.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.903
[beeping]

35:32.097 --> 35:35.271
Since that plane went down,
it just doesn't seem real.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.069
Ransom and hijacking.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.941
And Caitlin's right in the middle.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.585
Boy, is her Mom gonna be mad.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.585
Hey, what's that?

35:48.213 --> 35:50.284
Hey String, I swear, it's them.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.157
It's them, String!

35:52.651 --> 35:54.255
It's really them!

35:56.354 --> 35:58.493
Air Rescue, this is Ranger.

35:59.024 --> 36:02.005
We've just spotted flight 093.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.368
I repeat.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.135
We believe we have spotted 093.

36:10.869 --> 36:15.318
(Dominic) Our bearing is longitude 114 west,

36:15.907 --> 36:18.979
latitude 27 north.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.255
Get out here fast.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.224
(man) All right, longitude 62…

36:33.958 --> 36:35.631
Okay, over you go.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.898
Oh, my.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.437
Oh, my.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.767
- What?
- Oh, oh, my!

37:14.599 --> 37:15.907
Oh, my!

37:15.967 --> 37:17.503
Hawke, is that you?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.912
Hawke, is that you?

37:18.970 --> 37:20.449
It's a diver.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.074
[passengers cheering]

37:22.974 --> 37:25.477
We're saved! We're saved!

37:34.719 --> 37:37.325
Let them know we'll have a rescue
unit out there within the hour

37:37.388 --> 37:38.799
to lift the plane out of the water.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.565
Commander, we are not flying a submarine.

37:42.894 --> 37:46.103
Well, whatever it is, you did
an incredible job, sir.

37:46.164 --> 37:47.871
And you should feel proud of yourselves.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.775
Yeah, yeah, sure.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.978
Oh, what the heck. Hooray!

37:56.040 --> 37:57.075
[laughing]

38:10.522 --> 38:12.559
Did you set the depth charges for 100 feet?

38:12.624 --> 38:15.298
- They're set.
- Okay, let me give it a test shot.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.380
Let's do it!

39:11.649 --> 39:13.219
I saw Caitlin.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.854
The plane’s intact.

39:15.119 --> 39:16.530
Thank God.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.829
Yeah, but it can't keep the water out forever.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.665
It shouldn't be much longer.

39:20.725 --> 39:22.932
Coast Guard Rescue's on its way.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.564
We better be on ours.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.267
We're not gonna just leave ‘em.

39:26.331 --> 39:29.335
Well String, we're practically
sucking on dry tanks now.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.108
Well at least mark the spot
for when the boats get here.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.013
- They'll know where they are.
- Okay.

39:41.512 --> 39:44.425
♪ Happy days are here again ♪

39:44.482 --> 39:47.895
♪ The skies above are blue again ♪

39:47.952 --> 39:51.297
♪ Let's sing a song of cheer again ♪

39:51.356 --> 39:54.701
♪ Happy days are here again ♪

39:57.762 --> 39:59.435
We'll get you outta here.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.306
We need swimsuits.

40:05.370 --> 40:09.079
Oh darl’n, happily the water's
not deep enough for that.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.511
Caitlin,

40:14.479 --> 40:16.220
look I was wondering,

40:16.281 --> 40:17.817
when we get out of here…

40:17.882 --> 40:18.917
Yes.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.222
Now, that wasn't too hard, was it?

40:21.819 --> 40:23.162
Yes, what?

40:23.888 --> 40:27.768
Yes, when we get out of here, we
can get together someplace dry.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.300
That's incredible.

40:32.463 --> 40:34.465
- What's incredible?
- Well, you are.

40:34.532 --> 40:37.376
You knew I was gonna ask you out for a date.

40:38.002 --> 40:40.505
Well you see, my socks may not be dry

40:40.571 --> 40:44.109
and my composure is not up to
par, but my instincts are intact.

40:44.208 --> 40:47.621
I think it would be very nice to
see you someplace other than this.

40:47.679 --> 40:50.626
Listen, for right now, you
could buy me a cup of coffee.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.355
- You've got it.
- Okay.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.392
You stay here, sugar.

40:58.890 --> 41:02.531
(Dominic) Here they come, rescue
ships, the first of ‘em, anyway.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.163
- Drop a dye marker.
- Drop a dye marker.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.202
There you go boys, “X” marks the spot.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.575
(Joskins) They're already here.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.774
(Hergos) Shoot it down.

41:12.837 --> 41:14.407
It looks military, it could be armed, man.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.110
Use a rocket.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.248
[passengers cheering]

41:34.492 --> 41:36.597
Hey, go get ‘em, sailor.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.936
- What the…
- We're losin’ altitude.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.946
[beeping] Number 2 engine's out.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.316
They're signaling.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.777
They're signaling us!

41:52.510 --> 41:55.787
Now, drop a charge over the
spot, while I come about.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.295
[passengers screaming]

42:17.702 --> 42:20.342
What in God's name are they doing?

42:22.040 --> 42:23.542
(Stringfellow) Give me a Hellfire.

42:23.608 --> 42:25.281
(Dominic) Somethings wrong.

42:25.343 --> 42:26.720
What, a malfunction?

42:26.778 --> 42:29.952
That rocket tore up our
pods. Everything's jammed.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.089
(Stringfellow) Guns.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.925
They're coming around for another run.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.765
The whole system's shorted out.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.327
The circuitry's shattered.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.930
String, we got to keep 'em
away from that airplane.

42:48.599 --> 42:50.670
He's coming back!

42:54.605 --> 42:56.050
[beeping]

43:06.918 --> 43:08.693
Hit it with the 50’s.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.909
If I can get this cover off, I can splice it.

43:26.304 --> 43:28.682
We just gotta keep ‘em away from that spot.

43:51.329 --> 43:54.333
I almost had it. Give me a
steady platform, will ya?

43:58.136 --> 44:00.241
All right, try ‘em now.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.683
The Coast Guard ships
should be here any minute.

44:44.749 --> 44:47.252
At least we'll be here to bring ‘em in.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.861
[passengers chattering]

44:59.997 --> 45:02.273
It's been quiet for some time now.

45:08.973 --> 45:10.077
Ah.

45:10.508 --> 45:13.717
Is that a great sight or is that a great sight?

45:24.121 --> 45:25.327
Listen.

45:27.491 --> 45:30.495
It's got to be a whole fleet of ships. Yeah.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.639
That's got to be the rescue force.

45:33.698 --> 45:35.405
(Caitlin) We're okay, everybody.
My friends, they found us.

45:35.466 --> 45:36.501
- They're gonna rescue us.
- We're saved.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.945
Everything is gonna be okay. They're out there.

45:48.713 --> 45:53.093
My dear, if your Mother has
any complaints about you,

45:53.150 --> 45:54.993
have her call me.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.588
In my book, you're a hero.

46:03.861 --> 46:05.499
Are you a hero?

46:05.997 --> 46:07.601
Oh, darl’n,

46:07.865 --> 46:09.344
I don't know.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.359
(Announcer) Yesterday's extraordinary
drama concluded happily

46:29.420 --> 46:32.799
for all passengers aboard ill-fated flight 093

46:32.857 --> 46:35.531
with heroic efforts by
our Navy and Coast Guard.

46:35.593 --> 46:38.802
All 156 passengers and most of the crew

46:38.896 --> 46:42.002
- were safely returned to shore...
- Mom, I'm sorry I wasn't there.

46:42.066 --> 46:45.172
Yeah. Well, tell her I
won't miss her next wedding.

46:45.903 --> 46:47.905
Mom, I didn't mean it that way.

46:48.005 --> 46:50.178
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

46:51.575 --> 46:54.181
Uh-huh, I mailed all the
presents, every one of ‘em.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.383
Okay.

46:55.913 --> 46:57.517
Mom, I know.

46:57.682 --> 46:58.854
Okay.

46:59.016 --> 47:00.859
Listen, I'll call you later.

47:00.918 --> 47:03.330
Mom, who said you're wrong?

47:04.488 --> 47:07.264
Mom, you're right.
Yes, yes, you're always right.

47:07.325 --> 47:11.535
Mom, look, if I was married and I had
a family and a husband and children,

47:11.595 --> 47:13.472
I wouldn't have been on that plane.

47:13.531 --> 47:14.771
Right.

47:15.433 --> 47:17.106
I love you too, Mom.

47:17.168 --> 47:18.272
Okay.

47:22.206 --> 47:23.742
You mad at me?

47:24.875 --> 47:28.322
No, but you know, maybe your Mommy
has a point, you know that?

47:28.379 --> 47:30.484
You should be looking out for the future.

47:30.548 --> 47:32.755
And there's a lot of eligible
young men out there.

47:32.817 --> 47:34.228
Yeah? Where?

47:34.285 --> 47:35.662
Where?

47:35.986 --> 47:37.488
Well, huh?
