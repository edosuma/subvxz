WEBVTT

00:07.378 --> 00:11.542
( cackling manically )

00:11.542 --> 00:15.486
OKAY, WHAT IS WITH
ALL OF THE HAPPY,
SQUEAKY HAMSTER NOISES?

00:15.486 --> 00:19.050
DID YOU FINALLY
GROW A CHEST HAIR?

00:19.050 --> 00:20.621
NO!

00:20.621 --> 00:23.254
I GREW TWO.

00:24.555 --> 00:26.527
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
A LITTLE SOMETHING

00:26.527 --> 00:28.459
I LIKE TO CALL "ADAM'S PAYBACK."

00:28.459 --> 00:31.732
FOR WHAT?
 DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED LAST THURSDAY?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.666
OH, YEAH.

00:35.666 --> 00:38.669
ADAM, THERE IS NO WAY
YOU CAN CLEAR THAT COUNTER.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.342
I CAN REACH THAT EASY.
 I'VE SEEN HIM DO IT.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.444
HEY. WHAT YOU GUYS
TALKIN' ABOUT?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.775
THIS.

00:44.775 --> 00:46.447
AAAH!

00:49.780 --> 00:52.353
TOLD YOU.

00:52.353 --> 00:55.656
OH, YEAH. WE ALL LOVE
THE "BIONIC BROTHER TOSS."

00:55.656 --> 00:59.130
YEAH? WELL, LET'S SEE
HOW HE LIKES THIS.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.266
TRAP.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.367
TRAP WHAT?

01:06.367 --> 01:07.698
WHOA!

01:07.698 --> 01:09.840
Chase: OH, YES!

01:09.840 --> 01:11.542
IT WORKED! NOW LET'S SEE

01:11.542 --> 01:14.375
HOW YOU LIKE BEING
RELENTLESSLY MANHANDLED!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.679
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.682
OH, THE TRAP WAS
ON THE FLOOR.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.786
YEP, AND NOW
WE'RE GONNA PLAY A GAME
CALLED "HUMAN PIÑATA."

01:25.786 --> 01:29.460
BUT INSTEAD OF CANDY,
WE'RE GONNA GUESS WHAT
ADAM HAD FOR LUNCH.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.193
IRONICALLY,
I'M GUESSING IT'S CANDY.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.226
YOU'RE FORGETTING
ONE THING, CHASE--

01:35.226 --> 01:37.828
I CAN USE MY HEAT VISION
TO BREAK FREE.

01:40.531 --> 01:42.403
( thud )
 AAAH! OOH!

01:45.376 --> 01:47.638
HA! NICE TRY!

01:47.638 --> 01:50.511
OH-- ADAM?

01:50.511 --> 01:55.246
WHOA. I NEVER KNEW
MY ARM COULD BEND LIKE THAT.

01:55.246 --> 01:58.389
UM...IT CAN'T.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.693
OWWWW!

02:02.693 --> 02:04.124
OHHH!

02:04.124 --> 02:07.198
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:07.198 --> 02:08.799
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.462
FASTER. SMARTER.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.764
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:13.764 --> 02:16.136
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:16.136 --> 02:18.869
♪♪

02:54.675 --> 02:58.849
YOU'RE LUCKY IT'S JUST
A DISLOCATION.

02:58.849 --> 03:02.213
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU GUYS
NOT TO GOOF AROUND?

03:02.213 --> 03:05.616
BRACE YOURSELF,
BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY
GONNA SHATTER YOUR WORLD,

03:05.616 --> 03:07.888
BUT THEY DON'T LISTEN
TO A WORD YOU SAY.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.791
LOOK, I KNOW THIS
WAS A FREAK ACCIDENT,

03:10.791 --> 03:12.463
BUT HE COULD HAVE
SERIOUSLY BEEN HURT.

03:12.463 --> 03:14.365
WHAT IF HE'D HAVE
LANDED ON HIS HEAD?

03:14.365 --> 03:17.398
UH, IT WOULD HAVE POPPED OPEN,
SPRAYING CONFETTI EVERYWHERE?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.670
OH HO! THAT WOULD
BE AWESOME!

03:20.871 --> 03:22.803
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.576
BUT MR. DAVENPORT,
I WASN'T TRYING TO HURT HIM--

03:25.576 --> 03:27.278
I WAS TRYING
TO GET EVEN.

03:27.278 --> 03:29.310
ADAM IS ALWAYS PUNCHING ME
AND THROWING ME AROUND.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.742
YEAH, BUT WHEN I DO IT,
IT'S FUNNY.

03:31.742 --> 03:34.315
ADAM, IT IS NOT FUNNY.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.288
IF ANY OF YOU
GET SERIOUSLY HURT
WHEN I'M NOT AROUND,

03:37.288 --> 03:39.550
ALL IT TAKES IS
ONE X-RAY OF YOUR BIONIC CHIP

03:39.550 --> 03:42.523
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
 Leo: YEP.

03:42.523 --> 03:46.627
YOU THREE GO TO
A GOVERNMENT FACILITY,
YOU GO TO THE BIG HOUSE,

03:46.627 --> 03:49.430
AND I GET A BIG OLD MANSION
ALL TO MYSELF.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.633
LEO, THIS IS SERIOUS.
 OH, COME ON--

03:52.633 --> 03:55.736
THIS REALLY CAN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME ADAM
HAS EVER GOTTEN HURT.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.308
NO, IT REALLY IS.

03:57.308 --> 03:59.440
ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE
BEEN SOME CLOSE CALLS.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.673
YEAH, LIKE THAT ONE TIME
I REACHED UNDER THE TABLE
AND WHEN I STOOD UP I--

04:02.673 --> 04:04.815
( thud )
 OHH!

04:04.815 --> 04:07.748
OHH. HEY, IT WAS
JUST LIKE THAT!

04:09.450 --> 04:12.683
LOOK, YOU'RE ALL
GONNA HAVE TO START BEING
A LOT MORE CAREFUL.

04:12.683 --> 04:15.526
YOU'RE SUPERHUMAN,
BUT YOU'RE NOT INVINCIBLE.

04:15.526 --> 04:17.488
MAYBE NOT,
BUT I CAN STILL DO THIS.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.491
AHHH! OOF!

04:20.491 --> 04:22.493
THAT HURTS!

04:22.493 --> 04:24.835
GREAT, NOW BREE'S
THE STRONGEST.

04:27.938 --> 04:30.270
( TV on )

04:30.270 --> 04:32.603
OH, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!

04:33.874 --> 04:35.546
OKAY, I DON'T WANT
TO SPOIL IT,

04:35.546 --> 04:37.778
BUT HE FALLS OFF A CLIFF,
THOSE TWO GET MARRIED,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.481
AND THAT BEAR IS
HER FATHER IN DISGUISE.

04:42.513 --> 04:45.786
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO DO THAT?!

04:45.786 --> 04:48.959
(Leo's voice):
"I'M LEO, AND I HAVE TO RUIN
EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE."

04:51.522 --> 04:53.424
WHAT--

04:53.424 --> 04:54.695
DID YOU JUST--

04:54.695 --> 04:57.598
WHAT'D YOU JUST DO?!

04:57.598 --> 04:59.770
(Leo's voice):
I HAVE NO IDEA!

05:02.603 --> 05:05.005
BREE, REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU
THAT STRANGE THINGS

05:05.005 --> 05:07.307
MIGHT BE HAPPENING
TO YOUR BIONICS?

05:07.307 --> 05:11.482
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAVE UNCOVERED ONE
OF YOUR HIDDEN ABILITIES.

05:11.482 --> 05:16.046
EITHER THAT OR PUBERTY
HAS BEEN VERY UNKIND TO YOU.

05:18.088 --> 05:20.951
IT'S NOT FUNNY. THIS IS
REALLY FREAKING ME OUT.

05:20.951 --> 05:24.525
FREAKING YOU OUT?
YOU JACKED MY VOICE, MAN!

05:24.525 --> 05:28.098
IT SEEMS TO BE
SOME KIND OF VOCAL
MANIPULATION.

05:28.098 --> 05:29.560
WHENEVER BREE
HEARS A SOUND,

05:29.560 --> 05:31.462
HER BIONICS MANIPULATE
HER VOCAL CORDS

05:31.462 --> 05:34.365
TO REPRODUCE THE EXACT
SAME SONIC WAVE LENGTH.

05:34.365 --> 05:35.636
OKAY, THAT'S FAIR.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.638
SO CHASE GETS TO MOVE STUFF
WITH HIS MIND,

05:37.638 --> 05:40.711
AND I'M A VENTRILOQUIST
WITHOUT A DUMMY.

05:40.711 --> 05:44.575
LOOK, I'M GUESSING
YOU WILL DEVELOP
A BANK OF VOICES AND SOUNDS

05:44.575 --> 05:46.417
THAT WILL COME IN HANDY
ON MISSIONS.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.779
BUT UNTIL THEN,
DO NOT USE IT.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.581
IT'S NOT A TOY.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.557
(Davenport's voice):
RIGHT, IT'S NOT A TOY.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.390
AND I'M AWESOME! HA!

05:59.390 --> 06:02.893
YOU CAN DO HIM, TOO?
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

06:02.893 --> 06:06.767
OH. NOW SAY,
"MY NAME IS DONALD DAVENPORT,

06:06.767 --> 06:09.940
AND I WOULD LIKE TO
WITHDRAW ALL MY MONEY
FROM THIS BANK."

06:15.145 --> 06:17.548
ADAM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:17.548 --> 06:19.510
THAT ACCIDENT
WAS A WAKE-UP CALL.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.752
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW UNSAFE THE WORLD IS--

06:21.752 --> 06:23.584
DANGER LURKS AT EVERY CORNER,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.085
AND IT USES THE STAIRS
TO GET THERE!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.521
GO AROUND, THISTLE!
I WAS HERE FIRST!

06:33.624 --> 06:37.498
WAIT. IF YOU'RE SUDDENLY
SO SAFETY CONSCIOUS,

06:37.498 --> 06:40.971
THEN I GUESS YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO RUN AFTER ME
WHEN I DO THIS.

06:40.971 --> 06:42.102
OW!

06:42.102 --> 06:43.504
HEY, BE CAREFUL!

06:43.504 --> 06:45.105
RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS
IS DANGEROUS!

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
LIVES ARE AT STAKE HERE!

06:48.839 --> 06:51.612
HEY, YOU DO KNOW YOUR CLASS
IS DOWNSTAIRS, RIGHT?

06:54.645 --> 06:55.986
COME ON, BREE,

06:55.986 --> 06:58.549
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE
TO USE YOUR VOCAL MANIPULATION.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.621
IT'S A HOTBED OF
AUTHORITY FIGURES,

07:00.621 --> 07:01.792
HORMONAL CHANGES,

07:01.792 --> 07:03.724
AND PEOPLE I NEED
TO GET EVEN WITH.

07:05.756 --> 07:08.599
OKAY, FINE.
YOU WANT ME
TO USE IT?

07:08.599 --> 07:09.760
(Leo's voice):
HI, I'M LEO DOOLEY,

07:09.760 --> 07:11.702
AND THAT HORRIBLE STENCH
YOU'RE SMELLING IS ME.

07:11.702 --> 07:12.903
CAN I HAVE A HUG?

07:15.566 --> 07:18.609
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I TAKE A BATH EVERY DAY.

07:18.609 --> 07:21.642
SNIFF ME.
THAT'S "HIBISCUS WATERFALLS."

07:23.744 --> 07:25.145
ALL RIGHT!

07:25.145 --> 07:27.948
WHO PUT A RAW CHICKEN
IN MY DESK?!

07:27.948 --> 07:29.650
JOKE'S ON YOU.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.023
AN OLD DELI ACCIDENT
LEFT ME IMMUNE
TO SALMONELLA.

07:35.856 --> 07:40.591
BREE, YOU HAVE TO IMITATE
PRINCIPAL PERRY!

07:40.591 --> 07:44.034
NO WAY. I'M NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE USING THIS
ABILITY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:44.034 --> 07:46.136
COME ON, THIS IS
TOO GOOD TO PASS UP.

07:46.136 --> 07:48.569
DO IT! DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!

07:48.569 --> 07:50.200
UHH! OKAY, FINE.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.942
BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.005
ATTENTION, STUDENTS!

07:55.005 --> 07:56.547
(Bree as Perry):
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT:

07:56.547 --> 07:58.178
I'M A LEPRECHAUN.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.751
WHO SAID THAT?
IT'S NOT TRUE!

08:00.751 --> 08:03.483
I JUST LIKE TO
RUN AFTER RAINBOWS!

08:05.586 --> 08:08.188
(as Perry): I ALSO HAVE
SIX TOES ON ONE FOOT.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.763
IT'S NOT A SIXTH TOE,
IT'S AN OVERGROWN BUNION!

08:12.763 --> 08:15.596
AND IT GIVES ME THE BALANCE
OF A LOW-LYING GORILLA!

08:15.596 --> 08:18.128
( laughter )

08:18.128 --> 08:20.100
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S DOING THIS,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.933
BUT WHEN I CATCH YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA PAY!

08:24.504 --> 08:26.907
(as Perry): BUT NOT
WITH ME GOLD COINS!

08:31.211 --> 08:32.582
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND?

08:32.582 --> 08:34.645
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS!
 NO, I'M NOT!

08:34.645 --> 08:36.186
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:36.186 --> 08:39.149
OUR MISSION MOTHER HERE
IS SO OBSESSED WITH SAFETY

08:39.149 --> 08:41.652
THAT HE ALMOST JEOPARDIZED
THE ENTIRE OPERATION.

08:41.652 --> 08:42.793
HE WOULDN'T PITCH IN,

08:42.793 --> 08:44.855
HE SECOND-GUESSED
EVERYTHING I SAID,

08:44.855 --> 08:47.127
AND LOOK WHAT HE DID
TO OUR MISSION SUITS.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.001
WELL, WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:51.001 --> 08:53.103
THEY WOULDN'T WEAR
THEIR SAFETY HATS.

08:55.005 --> 08:57.638
ADAM, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING CAUTIOUS.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.810
BUT IF YOU'RE TOO CAUTIOUS,
YOU'LL OVERTHINK THINGS

08:59.810 --> 09:01.842
AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO COMPLETE YOUR MISSIONS.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.975
OH. SO IF I'M NOT CAREFUL,
I COULD GET HURT.

09:04.975 --> 09:07.017
BUT IF I'M TOO CAREFUL,
I'M USELESS.

09:07.017 --> 09:08.849
EXACTLY.

09:08.849 --> 09:12.623
GREAT. NO MATTER WHAT I DO
I'M EITHER HURTING MYSELF
OR THE TEAM.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.186
I'M NOT GONNA BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

09:16.186 --> 09:18.228
I'M NOT GOING ON
ANY MORE MISSIONS.

09:18.228 --> 09:19.329
WHAT?
 WHAT?
 WHAT?

09:19.329 --> 09:21.662
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.694
I'M SAYING I QUIT.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.111
I CAN'T BELIEVE
ADAM SAID HE'S QUITTING.
WHAT A BABY.

09:41.111 --> 09:43.914
HE'S HAD HIS CONFIDENCE
RATTLED.

09:43.914 --> 09:46.256
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WHEN A BASEBALL PLAYER
GETS HIT BY THE PITCH

09:46.256 --> 09:49.960
AND HE'S AFRAID TO
STEP UP TO THE PLATE AGAIN.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.063
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS,
RIGHT? MY HIGH SCHOOL SPORT
WAS A.P. CHEMISTRY.

09:55.726 --> 09:57.067
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.929
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M LOVING THIS BECAUSE

09:58.929 --> 10:02.602
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
I'M THE ONE MAKING HIM FLINCH.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.835
LOOK AT THIS. SEE THAT?
BRUISE-FREE!

10:04.835 --> 10:07.978
I CAN FINALLY WEAR
SHORT SLEEVES AGAIN.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.911
LOOK, CHASE, I KNOW
THIS IS FUN FOR YOU,

10:10.911 --> 10:12.983
BUT IF ADAM STOPS
GOING ON MISSIONS,

10:12.983 --> 10:15.085
WE AS A UNIT
ARE IN TROUBLE.

10:15.085 --> 10:18.148
THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS
IS TO STOP TEARING DOWN
HIS CONFIDENCE

10:18.148 --> 10:19.619
AND START BUILDING IT UP
AGAIN.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.221
I CAN'T DO THAT.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.253
IF HE GETS HIS CONFIDENCE BACK,

10:23.253 --> 10:25.295
I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK
TO BEING HIS PUNCHING BAG.

10:25.295 --> 10:29.629
OR MAYBE NOW THAT
ADAM KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE PICKED ON,

10:29.629 --> 10:30.961
HE'LL TREAT YOU
DIFFERENTLY.

10:30.961 --> 10:33.263
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

10:33.263 --> 10:36.336
BUT ADAM ISN'T REALLY
THE BEST AT LEARNING...

10:36.336 --> 10:38.869
THINGS.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.914
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

10:43.914 --> 10:47.948
GOOD. 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA HAVE TO. UGH.

10:51.682 --> 10:55.756
I'VE GOT NEWS FOR
WHOEVER PARKED THEIR BIKE
IN MY PARKING SPOT:

10:55.756 --> 10:58.729
UH, YOU NEED A NEW BIKE,

10:58.729 --> 11:01.191
AND YOU OWE ME FOUR TIRES!

11:02.863 --> 11:05.265
I'M GONNA
DO HER VOICE AGAIN.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.197
BAD IDEA, BREE.

11:07.197 --> 11:08.999
SHE REALLY LOOKS MAD,

11:08.999 --> 11:11.401
AND WITH PERRY,
YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHEN TO DRAW THE LINE.

11:11.401 --> 11:14.174
COME ON. I'M LOVING THIS.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.807
I NEVER KNEW BIONICS
COULD BE SO MUCH FUN!

11:16.807 --> 11:18.749
THE LAST TIME
SHE TURNED THAT RED,

11:18.749 --> 11:23.053
THE JANITOR HAD TO TAKE HER DOWN
WITH A TRANQUILIZER GUN.

11:23.053 --> 11:25.756
AND IT TOOK THREE SHOTS.

11:25.756 --> 11:30.290
SOMEBODY BETTER FESS UP.
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.422
(Perry's voice):
BECAUSE SCHOOL ENDS RIGHT NOW.

11:32.422 --> 11:35.025
( bell rings, students cheer )
 NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

11:35.025 --> 11:37.127
WHO SAID THAT?
SCHOOL ISN'T OVER!

11:37.127 --> 11:39.469
DON'T MAKE ME GO HOME.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.032
AHA.

11:42.032 --> 11:43.774
LATER.

11:43.774 --> 11:44.905
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
DOOLEY!

11:44.905 --> 11:45.976
(as Perry)
KEEP WALKIN', DOOLEY!

11:45.976 --> 11:47.838
FREEZE, DOOLEY!
 BEAT IT, DOOLEY!

11:47.838 --> 11:50.380
PARK IT, DOOLEY!
 ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?

11:50.380 --> 11:53.343
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO...

11:54.484 --> 11:57.948
...HAVE A NICE DAY?

11:58.989 --> 12:00.120
HI.

12:01.191 --> 12:03.123
GAHHH!

12:03.123 --> 12:05.095
SO...

12:05.095 --> 12:07.097
YOU'RE THE LITTLE
COMEDIAN, HUH?

12:07.097 --> 12:12.833
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE
SO GOOD AT IMITATING THE CHORUS
OF ANGELS THAT IS MY VOICE,

12:12.833 --> 12:15.936
BUT GO AHEAD--
SHOW ME HOW YOU DO IT.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.007
UH--WELL..

12:17.007 --> 12:18.909
I'M WAITING.

12:18.909 --> 12:21.111
WELL, I'M NOT...
( bell rings)...

12:21.111 --> 12:23.073
(as Chase):
REALLY SURE...
( alarm blares)..

12:23.073 --> 12:25.375
(as Leo):
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY...
( bird chirping )...

12:25.375 --> 12:27.177
(as Adam)
AT THIS EXTREMELY...
( wolf howls )...

12:27.177 --> 12:30.020
(boy) AWKWARD (girl) MOMENT...
( clown car horn ).

12:34.024 --> 12:36.286
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
 THAT WAS.

12:36.286 --> 12:39.089
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING IN THERE
WAS OFFENSIVE.

12:39.089 --> 12:41.391
I'M CALLING YOUR DAD,
AND YOU'RE STAYING AFTER SCHOOL.

12:41.391 --> 12:43.533
DON'T MOVE.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.039
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

12:49.039 --> 12:52.142
I GOT SO NERVOUS
WHEN PERRY BUSTED ME
THAT I GLITCHED.

12:52.142 --> 12:55.505
NOW DAVENPORT'S GONNA KNOW
I USED MY VOCAL MANIPULATION!

12:55.505 --> 12:57.177
( dog bark )

12:59.109 --> 13:02.953
IF ONLY SOMEONE SUAVE,
COOL AND COLLECTED

13:02.953 --> 13:05.255
HAD TOLD YOU NOT TO.

13:05.255 --> 13:08.088
YEAH, WELL, THEY DIDN'T--
YOU DID.

13:10.821 --> 13:13.824
ADAM, DID YOU PUT A SEAT BELT
ON THE TOILET?

13:13.824 --> 13:17.928
YEP. AND IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
OF A BATHTUB OVERFLOW,

13:17.928 --> 13:20.200
THE BATH MAT MAY BE USED
AS A FLOTATION DEVICE.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.935
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
 SAFETY SUIT.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.477
YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO SAFE
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING TOAST.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.112
( exhales )

13:35.315 --> 13:38.588
ADAM, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
LIFE IS ABOUT GETTING HURT.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.922
I GET HURT ALL THE TIME,
BUT I DON'T GO OVERBOARD
AND QUIT.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.094
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
 TO GET HURT.

13:44.094 --> 13:46.096
I'M A HUGE, MUSCULAR,
BEASTLY MAN.

13:46.096 --> 13:47.457
FOR ME IT'S JUST UNNATURAL.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.332
LOOK, YOU CAN'T QUIT THE TEAM.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.034
WITHOUT YOU,
BREE AND I CAN'T DO IT.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.967
WE NEED YOUR STRENGTH
AND YOUR...

13:56.967 --> 13:57.938
STRENGTH.

13:59.269 --> 14:01.111
SORRY, CHASE,
I MADE UP MY MIND.

14:01.111 --> 14:05.115
HEY, YOU KNOW THE SAYING
"THERE IS NO 'ME' IN 'TEAM'"?

14:05.115 --> 14:06.316
( toaster dings )

14:08.118 --> 14:10.220
MMM. THERE.

14:10.220 --> 14:13.453
I SUCCESSFULLY MADE TOAST
AND AVOIDED INJURY

14:13.453 --> 14:14.584
ALL THANKS TO MY--

14:19.859 --> 14:21.892
SAFETY SUIT.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.037
GREAT. NOW PERRY'S
GONNA TELL DAVENPORT

14:27.037 --> 14:28.538
I WAS USING
MY VOCAL MANIPULATION.

14:28.538 --> 14:31.871
YEAH, I LIKE TO SPLIT THE WORLD
UP INTO MY PROBLEMS

14:31.871 --> 14:33.343
AND OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS,

14:33.343 --> 14:35.976
AND THIS SEEMS TO FALL
SQUARELY IN THE LATTER.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.048
SO HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.509
NO. NO.

14:39.509 --> 14:43.083
THIS IS PARTLY YOUR FAULT.
HELP ME.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.885
HOW? IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN
JUST BE HOME RIGHT NOW

14:45.885 --> 14:47.117
TO TAKE THE CALL
TO DAVENPORT.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.890
OH, RIGHT. YOU CAN.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.994
OH, GREAT.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.926
NOW I'M LATE FOR
MY ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASS.

14:55.926 --> 14:58.628
I HATE IT WHEN I'M LATE
FOR THAT CLASS!!!

15:00.330 --> 15:03.403
ALL RIGHT, DAVENDORK,
LET'S SEE WHAT EXCUSE
YOU COME UP WITH

15:03.403 --> 15:05.905
FOR YOUR LITTLE DELINQUENTS
THIS TIME.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.208
( telephone ringing )

15:10.240 --> 15:11.241
HELLO? UH--

15:11.241 --> 15:12.682
(as Davenport):
I MEAN, HELLO,

15:12.682 --> 15:14.044
THIS IS DONALD DAVENPORT.

15:14.044 --> 15:17.147
DON, TERRY PERRY.

15:17.147 --> 15:20.120
LISTEN, YOUR LITTLE
DELINQUENT BREE

15:20.120 --> 15:22.352
IS BECOMING
A PAIN IN THE NECK
AT SCHOOL.

15:22.352 --> 15:26.997
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM,
BECAUSE I CAN BARELY STAND
THE KIDS WHO BEHAVE.

15:26.997 --> 15:29.099
(as Davenport):
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

15:29.099 --> 15:32.532
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
THE CHARMING, WELL BEHAVED
LITTLE PRINCESS

15:32.532 --> 15:34.704
I KNOW AS BREE.

15:34.704 --> 15:39.539
(laughs) WELL, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR PRINCESS SOUNDS LIKE
WHEN SHE'S IMITATING ME?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.111
I'LL PUT HER ON THE PHONE!

15:47.077 --> 15:48.118
DOOLEY!

15:50.020 --> 15:52.222
WHERE'S LITTLE MISS LIP FLAPPER?

15:53.223 --> 15:56.026
OH. SHE...IS--

15:56.026 --> 16:00.460
SAY, WHERE DO YOU GET
THOSE LOVELY PANTSUITS?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.593
I ORDER THEM OUT OF
A HUNTING CATALOG.

16:04.995 --> 16:07.037
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?!

16:08.999 --> 16:11.101
WHY DO I SMELL
BURNING RUBBER?

16:11.101 --> 16:13.303
I HATE THE SMELL
OF BURNING RUBBER!

16:15.205 --> 16:16.206
( Perry grumbling )

16:17.607 --> 16:20.110
OH. THERE YOU ARE.

16:20.110 --> 16:22.282
COME HERE AND TELL YOUR DAD
WHAT YOU DID.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.086
I AM SO SORRY.
 She's sorry.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.390
I IMITATED PRINCIPAL PERRY.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.024
YES, I WILL TELL HER
YOU WILL PUNISH ME
WHEN I GET HOME TONIGHT.

16:34.024 --> 16:37.027
OKAY, BYE.
 WAIT! I WASN'T
DONE WITH HIM!

16:37.027 --> 16:38.068
HELLO? DON? DON?

16:38.068 --> 16:39.329
HE HUNG UP.

16:39.329 --> 16:42.102
ARGH! I HATE IT WHEN
PEOPLE HANG UP ON ME!

16:43.373 --> 16:46.336
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
I'M CALLING HIM BACK.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.682
( telephone ringing )

16:55.545 --> 16:57.487
(as Davenport):
HELLO?

16:57.487 --> 17:01.591
OH. SO YOU'LL PUNISH HER
AT HOME, MR. DAVENPORT?

17:01.591 --> 17:02.792
YOU BETCHA.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.694
OKAY.

17:04.694 --> 17:07.297
WELL, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE
WHO'D LIKE TO SAY HI.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.601
HELLO, MR. DAVENPORT?

17:13.063 --> 17:15.704
THIS IS MR. DAVENPORT!

17:17.436 --> 17:20.210
(as Leo) HEY, BIG D.
LEO HERE.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.472
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT BREE,
BUT TRUST ME,

17:22.472 --> 17:25.275
THIS WAS ALL MY IDEA.

17:29.779 --> 17:32.822
I'M SORRY THAT I USED
MY VOCAL MANIPULATION.

17:32.822 --> 17:35.425
BUT TRUST ME, IF YOU HAD IT
YOU'D BE USING IT ALL DAY LONG.

17:35.425 --> 17:39.489
NO, I WOULD NOT,
BECAUSE I AM A MATURE ADULT.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.791
I'M AN ADULT.

17:41.791 --> 17:44.134
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.735
BUT IT'S ALSO A BIONIC ABILITY,

17:45.735 --> 17:48.168
AND WE CANNOT RISK
PEOPLE FINDING OUT ABOUT IT.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.170
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.801
AND CAN I JUST SAY THAT

17:51.801 --> 17:54.474
THIS HAS TAUGHT ME SO MUCH.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.307
THANK YOU FOR
SHARING YOUR WISDOM.

17:57.307 --> 18:01.080
I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON,
AND I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.312
HUGS?

18:02.312 --> 18:03.853
NICE TRY. YOU'RE GROUNDED.

18:05.855 --> 18:07.187
CLASSIC DAVENPORT--

18:07.187 --> 18:08.718
TOUGH BUT FAIR.

18:08.718 --> 18:10.089
YOU'RE GROUNDED TOO.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.261
ARE YOU INSANE?!

18:14.324 --> 18:16.496
HOW'D YOUR TALK WITH ADAM GO?
DID YOU BUILD UP HIS CONFIDENCE?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.097
IS HE READY TO GET BACK UP
ON THE HORSE?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.700
I KEEP TRYING, BUT WHENEVER
I SAY THE WORD "HORSE,"

18:20.700 --> 18:23.303
HE RUNS OUT OF THE ROOM
BECAUSE HE'S SCARED
HE'S GONNA GET KICKED.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.877
ALL RIGHT, CLEARLY,
LOGIC IS NOT GONNA WORK,

18:27.877 --> 18:32.582
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
RESORT TO SOME GOOD,
OLD-FASHIONED TRICKERY.

18:32.582 --> 18:36.486
LET'S PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER
AND COME UP WITH A WAY
TO OUTSMART ADAM.

18:37.687 --> 18:39.389
DONE.
 DONE.

18:43.193 --> 18:44.394
OKAY, GET READY.
HERE HE COMES.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.158
ADAM! OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE.

18:48.158 --> 18:49.599
THERE'S AN EMERGENCY.

18:49.599 --> 18:51.831
THE OPERATING SYSTEM
IN CHASE'S CAPSULE
HAS MALFUNCTIONED!

18:51.831 --> 18:52.832
SEE?

18:52.832 --> 18:55.865
OH, NO! I'M TRAPPED
IN MY CAPSULE!

18:55.865 --> 18:57.637
I CAN'T GET OUT!

18:59.239 --> 19:01.571
I SURE HOPE I DON'T
ASPHYXIATE IN HERE!

19:03.173 --> 19:05.175
AND STOP BREATHING.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.378
ADAM, YOU GOTTA
BREAK OPEN THE DOOR!

19:08.378 --> 19:11.251
YEAH, NICE TRY, GUYS.
I KNOW A PRANK WHEN I SEE ONE.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.254
IF THIS WERE REAL,
CHASE WOULD BE SCREAMING
AND GASPING FOR AIR,

19:14.254 --> 19:16.856
LIKE WHEN I USE HIM
TO CLEAN THE TOILET.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.289
ALL RIGHT, CHASE,
COME ON OUT.
HE'S NOT BUYING IT.

19:19.289 --> 19:21.391
( beeping, whirring )

19:21.391 --> 19:23.533
UH, MR. DAVENPORT?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.437
ADAM, YOUR--YOUR FOOT
TURNED ON THE HEAT SANITIZER!

19:27.437 --> 19:29.469
THAT THING GETS UP
TO 200 DEGREES!

19:29.469 --> 19:31.841
I REALLY CAN'T BREATHE!
GET ME OUT!

19:31.841 --> 19:33.843
IT'S LOCKED!

19:33.843 --> 19:36.306
ADAM, YOU GOTTA
BREAK DOWN THIS DOOR!

19:36.306 --> 19:37.907
AH, BRAVO!

19:37.907 --> 19:40.380
SO DRAMATIC!
YOUR ACTING'S MUCH BETTER
THIS TIME.

19:42.212 --> 19:43.913
DO IT!!!

19:43.913 --> 19:45.915
WAIT A MINUTE.
HE REALLY IS IN TROUBLE!

19:45.915 --> 19:47.857
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?!
 I DID!

19:48.958 --> 19:50.920
I'M COMING FOR YOU,
CHASEY!

20:03.233 --> 20:04.504
ARE YOU OKAY?

20:04.504 --> 20:06.836
WAIT, WAIT. SO YOU TWO
SET THIS WHOLE THING UP,

20:06.836 --> 20:09.379
AND CHASE ALMOST
TURNED INTO A S'MORE?

20:10.940 --> 20:13.283
HA! AND I'M THE DUMB ONE.

20:13.283 --> 20:16.786
ADAM...YOU JUST USED
YOUR SUPER STRENGTH

20:16.786 --> 20:18.648
TO SHATTER AN UNBREAKABLE
CAPSULE,

20:18.648 --> 20:20.420
AND FEAR NEVER EVEN
ENTERED YOUR MIND.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.922
YEAH. I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT GETTING HURT.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.354
I WASN'T THINKING AT ALL.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.458
LOOK, ALL THIS TIME
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN FEAR,

20:28.458 --> 20:30.229
AND WHEN YOU
DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK,

20:30.229 --> 20:31.661
YOU JUST GOT THE JOB DONE.

20:31.661 --> 20:33.703
WOW! THAT'S IT!

20:33.703 --> 20:37.437
FROM NOW ON I JUST NEED
TO SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE
NOT THINKING!

20:38.968 --> 20:40.970
ABSOLUTELY.
 ABSOLUTELY.

20:42.972 --> 20:44.914
SO, YOU'RE BACK ON MISSIONS?

20:44.914 --> 20:46.946
I GUESS I AM.
WHOO-HOO!

20:46.946 --> 20:49.619
PHEW. I'M GLAD
THAT WORKED OUT.

20:49.619 --> 20:52.852
AND I THINK YOU BOTH LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON TODAY?

20:52.852 --> 20:54.954
NO MORE HORSEPLAY.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.586
GOT IT.
 GOT IT.

20:58.288 --> 21:01.891
HEY, HOW ABOUT ONE MORE TOSS
JUST FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

21:01.891 --> 21:03.863
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
 NO, YOU DON'T.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.943
HOO HOO HOO HOO!

21:13.943 --> 21:15.775
ADAM, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.877
TRUST ME, BREE,
IT WILL WORK.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.355
TRAP.

21:25.355 --> 21:27.317
WAIT--TRAP WHAT?

21:27.317 --> 21:29.859
WHOA! UHH!

21:29.859 --> 21:33.292
TOLD YOU
YOU WEREN'T DOING IT RIGHT.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.365
YOU LEFT THE REMOTE
OVER HERE.

21:35.365 --> 21:39.298
DON'T WORRY. I CAN USE
MY HEAT VISION TO BREAK FREE.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.770
NO!
 NO!
 NO!
