WEBVTT

00:37.120 --> 00:39.120
You going somewhere?

00:40.760 --> 00:43.320
Without so much as saying goodbye?

00:44.440 --> 00:46.080
Goodbye.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.600
All I did was try to help you.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.920
Look at me.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.160
I've seen the way
you pull strings to enrich yourself

01:09.200 --> 01:11.840
and the people you call
your friends.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.720
It is not right
that so much wealth

01:15.760 --> 01:18.280
and so much power
are in the hands of so few.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.000
Who said that? Your priest?

01:20.000 --> 01:20.840
Who said that? Your priest?

01:20.880 --> 01:23.080
He didn't have to.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.800
This is about
what is fair and what is right.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.000
Nadya, there's the world
we'd like...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.440
Nadya, there's the world
we'd like...

01:31.440 --> 01:34.240
..and then there's
the world as it is.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.000
Idealism is a luxury
we can not afford.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.240
Idealism is a luxury
we can not afford.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.800
You can afford it.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.000
There's going to be a readjustment.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.040
There's going to be a readjustment.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.680
A recalculation.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.000
Finance will be democratised.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.520
And if you don't see that...

01:58.800 --> 02:00.000
..it will ruin you.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.160
..it will ruin you.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.320
Is that a threat?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.520
No.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.000
But I am a threat to you.
And so are my friends.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.600
But I am a threat to you.
And so are my friends.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.200
Your friends. From Flamestar?

02:13.920 --> 02:15.960
They're not your friends.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.280
You don't even know who they are.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.200
It was...

02:23.240 --> 02:24.000
It was never
my intention to hurt you.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.880
It was never
my intention to hurt you.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.880
You helped me and I am grateful.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.200
But I can't ignore
the pain you cause others.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.000
I'm sorry.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.480
I'm sorry.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.600
I'm going to ask around today.
For some names.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.960
Yeah. If you think it will help.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I see, so you don't.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.480
I see, so you don't.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.640
Like I said...

04:04.840 --> 04:07.800
..if you think counselling
will help, I'm there.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.000
Good. We'll discuss it tonight.
Yeah, sure.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.880
Good. We'll discuss it tonight.
Yeah, sure.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.920
What are you building there,
big man? You? Me?

04:13.960 --> 04:16.000
Go on, put another one.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.360
Go on, put another one.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.000
Careful, Carter, it's going to fall.
No, it won't.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.600
Go on. Hey, that's it.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.000
So this Massimo thing,
you're going to go ahead with it?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.760
So this Massimo thing,
you're going to go ahead with it?

04:25.800 --> 04:28.360
I said I was, didn't I?

04:28.400 --> 04:31.800
This isn't just a play, Oliver,
it's deceiving your friends.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.000
That's called getting ahead.
And this is what it takes.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.120
That's called getting ahead.
And this is what it takes.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.160
Is it? Slowly.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.640
The only way I move up at NYL

04:44.680 --> 04:48.000
is by proving to Liwei
that I'm no longer Massimo's man.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.560
is by proving to Liwei
that I'm no longer Massimo's man.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.320
By playing Judas?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.000
I hope it's worth
your 30 pieces of silver.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.920
I hope it's worth
your 30 pieces of silver.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.000
Hey, go on, put another one.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.200
Hey, go on, put another one.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.080
There you go.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.360
Ooh, one more, one more.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.640
You fall.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.320
Hey. Hey.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.000
You have the memory stick?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.240
You have the memory stick?

05:45.280 --> 05:48.640
It proves Dominic and Rebecca
undermined the referendum.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.680
They were involved in Kalim's death.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.000
Go to the police.
I can't. Not yet.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.960
Go to the police.
I can't. Not yet.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.280
Why not? There's a presidential
election coming up.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.000
Why stop with Brexit?
The police won't act.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.440
Why stop with Brexit?
The police won't act.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.360
They'll just keep going.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.000
I need your help.
You said yourself it's dangerous.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.120
I need your help.
You said yourself it's dangerous.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.320
I have to think about the baby.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.000
Are you keeping it?

06:16.000 --> 06:16.480
Are you keeping it?

06:19.040 --> 06:22.760
At some point you'll have to decide
if you want to be a father.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.000
Look, I'm not telling you this
to make you feel guilty.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.560
Look, I'm not telling you this
to make you feel guilty.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.800
Or to make you feel anything at all.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.000
It's just for your own sake.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.920
It's just for your own sake.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.000
I can only keep FramTek off
of NYL's radar for so long.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.600
I can only keep FramTek off
of NYL's radar for so long.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.640
48 hours at most. It'll be enough.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.000
Thank you.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.280
Thank you.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.000
Carolina. Can you be at the
EU Commission in Westminster

07:20.000 --> 07:20.760
Carolina. Can you be at the
EU Commission in Westminster

07:20.800 --> 07:24.120
in 30 minutes?
I'll be there. OK.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.000
Hi there.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.840
I gotta go.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.720
She's here.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.000
What are you doing here?
Looking for a job.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.120
What are you doing here?
Looking for a job.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.000
Going some place? Finland.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.440
Going some place? Finland.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.160
To finally close the
Ellams Automotive deal

08:11.200 --> 08:16.000
with Mikael Korhonen. But first, I
wanted to see where we stand on 5G.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.400
with Mikael Korhonen. But first, I
wanted to see where we stand on 5G.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.960
We're well-positioned, I think.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.800
Could you be more specific, please?

08:23.480 --> 08:24.000
Well, we're going after
three high-priority targets.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.440
Well, we're going after
three high-priority targets.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.680
Are Dominic and Massimo
going after those targets, too?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.800
Of course.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.000
You're confident we'll prevail?
Yes.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.360
You're confident we'll prevail?
Yes.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.000
Almost seems too good to be true.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.040
Almost seems too good to be true.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.320
That we could outmanoeuvre Massimo
on three prime acquisitions.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.000
It shouldn't. He's good.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.000
But I'm better.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.080
But I'm better.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.800
NYL offered me Head of Trading.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.400
And you didn't take it.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.560
It was conditional.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.360
They wanted me
to spy on Massimo, so...

09:01.400 --> 09:03.480
I resigned.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.520
What?

09:05.560 --> 09:08.920
I wish you'd realised
you had principles a little sooner.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.000
What Liwei made me do to you
has been eating me up.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.360
What Liwei made me do to you
has been eating me up.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.440
Honestly,
I should have just walked away.

09:16.480 --> 09:20.000
They always saw me
as Massimo's guy.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.200
They always saw me
as Massimo's guy.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.200
Truth is...

09:23.240 --> 09:25.000
they were right.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.080
Zhi?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.760
Could I have a moment?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.000
Alone. Chris, please.
Of course.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Alone. Chris, please.
Of course.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.760
I wanted you to know Oliver Harris
is no longer with the bank.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.000
Why?

09:52.000 --> 09:52.680
Why?

09:52.720 --> 09:55.360
A question of loyalty.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.960
Which, as you know, is the very
least I require from my employees.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.240
Of course.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.360
You can't be serious about the job.
I know I fucked up.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.000
And I know this is a big ask,
but I'm looking for a second chance.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.520
And I know this is a big ask,
but I'm looking for a second chance.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.960
I'll talk to Massimo.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.600
Thank you.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.000
Really.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.000
Hi. Hi.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Hi. Hi.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.680
Well?

10:44.720 --> 10:48.000
I guess I should have trusted
my instincts about Rebecca Farmer.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.160
I guess I should have trusted
my instincts about Rebecca Farmer.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.600
Massimo Ruggero,
my friend, Sara Dirks.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.280
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.000
Much like you,
Sara's not afraid of a fight.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.040
Much like you,
Sara's not afraid of a fight.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.680
Carolina has told me about you,
Mr Ruggero.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.520
And, of course, we'd love
to give Europe a secure 5G pipeline,

11:11.560 --> 11:12.000
protecting our data
from exploitation

11:12.000 --> 11:13.840
protecting our data
from exploitation

11:13.880 --> 11:15.800
by either the US or China.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
But no single European company
could achieve such a thing.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.400
But no single European company
could achieve such a thing.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.560
You're aware that Aikoa
wants to acquire FramTek.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.280
And you're aware
the EU Commissioner for Competition

11:26.320 --> 11:28.000
believes such a merger
would distort the market.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
believes such a merger
would distort the market.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.120
They've forbidden it.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.960
This merger is the only way

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
to safeguard
the privacy of EU citizens.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.360
to safeguard
the privacy of EU citizens.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.440
I think the Commissioner
could be persuaded.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.000
You would have to prove
that the alternative is not secure.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.120
You would have to prove
that the alternative is not secure.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.000
We need actual evidence
that another country's 5G

11:52.000 --> 11:52.880
We need actual evidence
that another country's 5G

11:52.920 --> 11:55.200
could be used to spy on Europeans.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.480
Without that, you've no chance.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.000
And if you had that evidence?

12:00.000 --> 12:00.960
And if you had that evidence?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.080
I expect the Commissioner
would agree

12:03.120 --> 12:05.800
that protecting Europe
must always be our priority.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.600
Promised her what?

12:13.640 --> 12:16.000
Hard evidence of illegal Chinese
surveillance in Europe.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.400
Hard evidence of illegal Chinese
surveillance in Europe.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.840
You said it was in the programming
for the contact tracing app.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.200
No.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.000
I can't help.
Carl, please...

12:24.000 --> 12:25.400
I can't help.
Carl, please...

12:25.440 --> 12:27.640
My family in Hong Kong
is suffering because of you.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.840
I know, but I'm not the one
punishing them.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.720
You know that.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.000
And now I need you.
I don't care..

12:32.000 --> 12:35.560
And now I need you.
I don't care..

12:36.680 --> 12:38.320
Not anymore.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.480
I understand.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.440
How could you?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.880
Because one of
my best friends is dead.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.320
How far are you willing to go?

12:57.160 --> 12:59.160
These 5G acquisitions.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.520
You've got the raw data?

13:03.560 --> 13:04.000
Of course.
Good. I want to review it.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Of course.
Good. I want to review it.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.440
You're not an analyst.
I'm not asking.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.400
I want it on my desk. Now.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.840
Alex...

13:24.880 --> 13:27.760
These 5G acquisitions,
how many years did you go back

13:27.800 --> 13:28.000
on each company?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.840
on each company?

13:29.880 --> 13:33.760
OK, I need you to go back
twice as far, on each one.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, leave nothing out.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.080
Yeah, leave nothing out.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.600
I want every single piece of raw
data on Chris Bailey's desk. Now.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.480
All those have anointed
themselves as new gods.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.000
Don't worry themselves...
The small matters of democracy.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.520
Don't worry themselves...
The small matters of democracy.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.840
Daniel Duval's sentence
for financial improprieties

14:22.880 --> 14:24.000
came to an abrupt end this morning.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.800
came to an abrupt end this morning.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.680
As The Home Office announced he
is to be expelled from the UK

14:27.720 --> 14:29.960
to Russia. You need to ask yourself

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
what sort of information
is important in the world today.

14:32.000 --> 14:32.720
what sort of information
is important in the world today.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.000
Good morning.
Good morning.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Good morning.
Good morning.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.000
Where's Nadya? She flew back to
Warsaw this morning.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.440
Where's Nadya? She flew back to
Warsaw this morning.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.120
They said it was
some kind of family emergency.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.640
Did you speak to her?

14:53.680 --> 14:56.000
I tried calling,
but it went straight to voicemail.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.480
I tried calling,
but it went straight to voicemail.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.640
Dominic knows.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.000
What happened at the EU?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.040
What happened at the EU?

15:05.080 --> 15:07.720
Officially, nothing.
And unofficially?

15:09.120 --> 15:11.440
If we can prove Chinese wrongdoing,

15:11.480 --> 15:12.000
they'll let the Aikoa-FramTek
merger go forward.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.320
they'll let the Aikoa-FramTek
merger go forward.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.360
Carl Wong is working on it now.
OK.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.680
We only have 48 hours.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.000
Simple, then.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.840
Simple, then.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.280
There's something else
I need to tell you. What?

15:25.320 --> 15:27.320
About Oliver.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.320
Mass.
Hey.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.000
Thanks for coming.
I heard you're looking for a job.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.920
Thanks for coming.
I heard you're looking for a job.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.320
Water, please. Thank you.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.000
It's funny, isn't it?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.360
It's funny, isn't it?

15:45.400 --> 15:47.520
Look, I get it.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.400
You're upset with me, I fucked up.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.000
I will do whatever it takes
to earn your trust.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.280
I will do whatever it takes
to earn your trust.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.400
Whatever it takes?

15:56.440 --> 15:58.720
Yeah.
Good.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.000
Spike Ellams Automotive.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.400
Spike Ellams Automotive.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.480
Seriously?
Yeah.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.560
You wanted
to take care of their employees.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.000
Now you're going to be a hero.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.960
Thank you.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.760
You do know that Liwei's flying
to Helsinki today to sign the deal?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.400
I do.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.000
What can I do? It's too late.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.560
What can I do? It's too late.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.280
Make Korhonen an offer 20 percent
higher than Huang Capital's.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.000
And who's going to put up
that kind of money?

16:24.000 --> 16:24.600
And who's going to put up
that kind of money?

16:24.640 --> 16:28.120
We've put together a consortium
of European companies.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.840
A consortium? Mm-hmm.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.600
And Mikael Korhonen's
left with nothing?

16:35.640 --> 16:37.640
I'll take care of him.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.840
Let's go.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.360
Thank you.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.000
Don't fuck it up.
I won't.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.160
Don't fuck it up.
I won't.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.000
We've been pretty clear
about how we view the risk

17:09.040 --> 17:12.000
connected to Huawei
and 5G infrastructure.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.040
connected to Huawei
and 5G infrastructure.

17:12.080 --> 17:15.760
The internet future must have
Western values embedded within it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.960
Are you sure
you want to know?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.040
There she is.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.000
It's a she.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.920
It's a she.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.000
Massimo!
Hey, mate, how are you?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.920
Massimo!
Hey, mate, how are you?

17:53.960 --> 17:56.440
I'm fine, thanks. Come here, look.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.000
What? Come on.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.080
What? Come on.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.280
Look.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.960
You look good.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.000
How are you?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.320
How are you?

18:20.520 --> 18:24.000
I've come...to ask you something.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.240
I've come...to ask you something.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.160
I have some information about Kalim
that I'd like to send to the press.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.920
With your permission.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.800
What kind of information?
About why he was killed.

18:39.800 --> 18:40.000
And Damian Curtis, too.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.760
And Damian Curtis, too.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.000
And I know it'll be painful.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And I know it'll be painful.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.400
Bringing all this
back in the public eye.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.000
The way they reported it, as though
he'd died just to prove their point.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.080
The way they reported it, as though
he'd died just to prove their point.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.840
I know.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.440
But this will be the truth, Amina.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.080
Then you'd better do it.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.240
Donald Trump has showered
Vladimir Putin with praise

19:10.280 --> 19:12.000
during a question-and-answer session
with military veterans.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.400
during a question-and-answer session
with military veterans.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.600
The Republican presidential nominee
told the forum that

19:16.640 --> 19:19.760
the Russian President is more of a
leader than the current President...

19:19.800 --> 19:20.000
Mr Morgan, Ms Farmer.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Mr Morgan, Ms Farmer.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.280
Mr Trump said that the leader
has great control over Russia...

19:25.320 --> 19:27.600
Told you he'd be useful.

19:27.640 --> 19:28.000
He's not elected yet.
He will be.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.040
He's not elected yet.
He will be.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.200
Brexit proved it.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.600
You have news?

19:35.640 --> 19:36.000
It's not good.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.760
It's not good.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.640
Massimo met with Sara Dirks
this morning.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.920
The EU Commission on Competition.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.000
She's an old friend
of Carolina Elsher's.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.480
She's an old friend
of Carolina Elsher's.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.200
First your protege, then Carolina...

19:49.240 --> 19:52.000
That must hurt. Losing two
of your favourite girls in one day.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.200
That must hurt. Losing two
of your favourite girls in one day.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.360
Replacing an investor like
Carolina won't be easy.

19:59.480 --> 20:00.000
I've already spoken to Anton Kozlov.
I'm not interested.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.040
I've already spoken to Anton Kozlov.
I'm not interested.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.920
You have someone else lined up
with those kind of resources?

21:13.440 --> 21:17.160
I reviewed the 5G acquisitions.
And...?

21:17.200 --> 21:20.000
FramTek looks
like a real prospect.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.160
FramTek looks
like a real prospect.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.600
A potential disruptor.
I'm looking at it.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.320
Funny, it looked to me
like you were trying to bury it

21:26.360 --> 21:28.000
in all that raw data you dumped on
me. And why would I do that, Chris?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.080
in all that raw data you dumped on
me. And why would I do that, Chris?

21:30.120 --> 21:31.920
You tell me.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.760
I'll look at it again. Don't bother.

21:35.800 --> 21:36.000
Scoop them up now
before Massimo does.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.200
Scoop them up now
before Massimo does.

21:38.240 --> 21:42.080
You're the risk guy,
not acquisitions. Just do it.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.200
Good morning, Ms Widholm,
fellow board members.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.960
It's my pleasure to introduce you
to Carolina Elsher.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.240
Aikoa has developed an impressive
proprietary technology.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.440
Putting you in a unique position

22:14.480 --> 22:16.000
to create
a secure 5G infrastructure...

22:16.000 --> 22:16.840
to create
a secure 5G infrastructure...

22:16.880 --> 22:20.360
In Europe. Your reputation precedes
you, Ms Elsher.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.280
And your offer of 400 million pounds
is generous.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.000
Almost too generous.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.600
Almost too generous.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.000
I assume there's a catch.
There is.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.080
FramTek doesn't just need cash.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.000
You need a partner who will help you
future-proof your technology.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.080
You need a partner who will help you
future-proof your technology.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.200
A partner with the technology
to roll out your tech

22:38.240 --> 22:40.000
in a large scale,
cost-effective way.

22:40.000 --> 22:40.640
in a large scale,
cost-effective way.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.560
And we've already been
down that route.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.200
The EU Commissioner would
never approve a merger with Aikoa.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.000
FramTek would have to agree
to be acquired.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.520
FramTek would have to agree
to be acquired.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.880
I know.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.680
We happen to think they will.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.080
Alright.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.400
Dominic Morgan.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.000
Anton Kozlov.
Welcome, Mr Kozlov.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.000
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I doubt that.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.360
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I doubt that.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.600
But as this is business,
not pleasure,

23:09.640 --> 23:12.000
I assume the source of my wealth
is not an issue for you.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.440
I assume the source of my wealth
is not an issue for you.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.720
Let's just say a common interest
outweighs our differences.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.960
Please, Mr Kozlov, have a seat.
We have much to discuss.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.080
Well?

23:27.120 --> 23:28.000
FramTek have signed off
on the Heads of Agreement.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.040
FramTek have signed off
on the Heads of Agreement.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.920
The legal team
are drawing up the full contract.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.320
What about Aikoa?
We're on it.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.000
You know,
we just might pull this off.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.120
You know,
we just might pull this off.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.240
Let me call you back, OK?

23:41.280 --> 23:43.280
Taxi!

23:44.800 --> 23:47.000
What a pleasure indeed, yes.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.680
Please.
Sure.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.000
We'll be in touch, Anton.
I'll see you.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.680
We'll be in touch, Anton.
I'll see you.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.920
Look at that smile. You had him
eating out of your hand.

23:59.960 --> 24:00.000
He's the kind of man who'll bite
the hand that feeds him.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.720
He's the kind of man who'll bite
the hand that feeds him.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.000
Well, at least
we've stopped the bleeding here.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.000
How are you going to stop Massimo?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.880
How are you going to stop Massimo?

24:09.920 --> 24:12.640
I've been working on it.
So have I.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.480
Is Massimo the father?

24:36.520 --> 24:39.800
Yes. Does he know?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.600
It's sweet, really.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.240
And useful.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.200
I will hold onto this.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.000
What are you going to do?
Not what you would do.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.960
What are you going to do?
Not what you would do.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.720
Alright, then.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.880
But you don't have much time.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.000
You don't need to tell me that.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.040
You don't need to tell me that.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Oliver?

25:51.920 --> 25:52.000
Mr Korhonen?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.480
Mr Korhonen?

25:53.520 --> 25:58.040
Well, if it isn't
Massimo Ruggero's loyal protege.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.000
How can I help you,
Mr Harris?

26:00.000 --> 26:00.920
How can I help you,
Mr Harris?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.240
The consortium
Massimo has put together

26:04.280 --> 26:07.600
is offering 20 percent more
than Theodore Huang.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.480
The consortium?
Who is putting up the money?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.600
I can't tell you that.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.000
You don't know.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.680
You don't know.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.960
I'd have to pay
a significant penalty.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.360
Huang already put the money
into an escrow account.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.000
But not into your account.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.480
But not into your account.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.720
You're still free to make a choice.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.280
I'm due to sign the contract
in about 20 minutes.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.240
Mr Korhonen...

26:37.280 --> 26:38.920
you're hesitating.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.000
Which tells me you're giving this
serious consideration.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.600
Which tells me you're giving this
serious consideration.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.600
Now, I know you don't have
all the intel you need

26:44.640 --> 26:46.880
to make an informed decision.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.000
But you do have great faith
in Massimo Ruggero.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.720
But you do have great faith
in Massimo Ruggero.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.000
Mr Korhonen.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.720
I don't believe you've met
Mr Huang.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.720
Mr Huang...

27:18.760 --> 27:20.000
I'm afraid there is no way
of sugar-coating this.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.480
I'm afraid there is no way
of sugar-coating this.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.320
I've received another offer.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.400
Excuse me?

27:25.440 --> 27:28.000
A significantly higher bid,
which I'd be foolish to reject.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.080
A significantly higher bid,
which I'd be foolish to reject.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.920
So sorry for wasting your time.

27:30.960 --> 27:35.000
This is outrageous.
It's only just landed on my desk.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.000
If I'd known before, I would
of course saved you a wasted trip.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.520
If I'd known before, I would
of course saved you a wasted trip.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.800
Good afternoon, Mr Korhonen.
I really am so sorry.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.720
Shh.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.880
Mr Ellams. Massimo.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.000
I never thought you and I would have
reason to speak again.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.680
I never thought you and I would have
reason to speak again.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.440
But I've just heard
from Mikael Korhonen.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.000
You're going to save
an awful lot of jobs here.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.760
You're going to save
an awful lot of jobs here.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.640
I'm eternally grateful.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.000
Please understand,
if word of my involvement got out...

28:32.000 --> 28:32.800
Please understand,
if word of my involvement got out...

28:32.840 --> 28:34.640
it wouldn't look good.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.920
Oliver made that abundantly clear,
don't worry.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.760
My lips are sealed.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.000
The hell do you think
you're playing at?

29:04.000 --> 29:04.920
The hell do you think
you're playing at?

29:04.960 --> 29:08.240
Doing what you asked. By killing
the Ellams Automotive deal?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.000
It was a test.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.000
I had to go through with it
to win Massimo's trust.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.880
I had to go through with it
to win Massimo's trust.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.240
See for yourself.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.840
What, you didn't think to warn us?

29:17.880 --> 29:20.000
You humiliated
the CEO of your own bank.

29:20.000 --> 29:20.480
You humiliated
the CEO of your own bank.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.360
That was never my intention.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.280
I had to play it straight or Massimo
would think I was a plant.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.000
You're sure Massimo doesn't know
that already? Hundred percent.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.760
You're sure Massimo doesn't know
that already? Hundred percent.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.720
Well, your little stunt just
cost this bank millions of pounds.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.000
So if you don't bring down
Dominic and Massimo and soon...

29:36.000 --> 29:37.440
So if you don't bring down
Dominic and Massimo and soon...

29:37.480 --> 29:40.240
you'll be out on your ass for real.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.680
Can I get a drink, please?

29:50.720 --> 29:52.000
Just something strong, whatever.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.720
Just something strong, whatever.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.000
Scotch, sir. Thanks.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.480
Scotch, sir. Thanks.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.680
Hey, can I get a drink, please?

30:24.600 --> 30:26.600
Hey. Hey.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.280
Drink?

30:28.320 --> 30:31.560
Vodka and soda, please.
Same again.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.160
So... What's so urgent?

30:36.200 --> 30:38.760
I passed the test.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.000
Massimo hired me.
So, we need to celebrate, man!

30:40.000 --> 30:42.720
Massimo hired me.
So, we need to celebrate, man!

30:42.760 --> 30:44.760
Hey, come on, come on.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.000
Come, let's take a selfie
for Massimo first.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.520
Come, let's take a selfie
for Massimo first.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.320
Come on, man, for Massimo.
OK, OK.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.200
There we go.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
How many of those
have you had? Oh...

31:04.000 --> 31:04.840
How many of those
have you had? Oh...

31:04.880 --> 31:07.480
To the pirates.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.720
Thank you.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.440
So...

31:18.480 --> 31:20.000
Fill me in.
About what?

31:20.000 --> 31:20.720
Fill me in.
About what?

31:20.760 --> 31:23.080
Hey, you remember back in the days.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.680
It was me, you, Massimo...

31:27.840 --> 31:28.000
..and Kalim.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
..and Kalim.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.680
Yeah.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.480
I miss that.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.000
I miss him.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.440
I miss him.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.320
You know? It's like he left a hole.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.040
Right here.
Just a hole where he was.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.440
You know?
I know.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.400
Things were simpler back then.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.000
I guess. Hey.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.120
Ellams...

31:58.160 --> 32:00.000
That was...

32:00.000 --> 32:00.200
That was...

32:00.240 --> 32:03.240
What's the big plan?
You know, like...

32:03.280 --> 32:06.960
Come on, you know with Massimo,
he's always got some secret.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.520
You know, under his sleeve...

32:11.560 --> 32:13.600
He'll tell you when he's ready.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.000
Come on, you know, it's...
We're a team.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.040
Come on, you know, it's...
We're a team.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.600
No?

32:20.480 --> 32:22.800
Oliver...

32:22.840 --> 32:24.000
We are way past this.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.320
We are way past this.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.760
Yeah... Shit.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.520
You're right, I'm stupid, I'm sorry.

32:32.840 --> 32:36.520
I'm going to go now.
You probably should.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.000
Go easy on those. Work tomorrow.

32:40.000 --> 32:40.720
Go easy on those. Work tomorrow.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.440
OK.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.000
I picked up yours.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.120
I picked up yours.

33:29.160 --> 33:32.160
Oh, that's why
my password didn't work.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.520
See you tomorrow.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.000
Oh, sorry.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.760
Oh, sorry.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.000
Ms Wu, this arrived
for you. Thank you.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.040
Ms Wu, this arrived
for you. Thank you.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.000
Zhi. Liwei's office. OK.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.880
Zhi. Liwei's office. OK.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.800
Now. Yeah.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.000
Where are we with FramTek?

37:07.040 --> 37:09.800
I'm preparing a bid.
You're dragging your feet.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.000
It's one of several 5G prospects
we're trying to pursue, Chris.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.160
It's one of several 5G prospects
we're trying to pursue, Chris.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.120
I told you to move on this
yesterday. I don't report to you.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.400
You know Open RAN interoperability

37:18.440 --> 37:20.000
poses a direct threat
to our strategic aims in Europe?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.280
poses a direct threat
to our strategic aims in Europe?

37:21.320 --> 37:23.520
FramTek might have the technology

37:23.560 --> 37:26.040
but they don't have the capacity
to pose any true threat.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.000
They would if they merged
with a partner like Aikoa.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.760
They would if they merged
with a partner like Aikoa.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.400
You will ignore
all other acquisitions.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.080
Acquire FramTek.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.080
Yeah.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.640
She lied to your face.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.000
She deserved a chance
to tell the truth.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.920
She deserved a chance
to tell the truth.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.000
Ms Widholm. It's an exciting day
for FramTek.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.160
Ms Widholm. It's an exciting day
for FramTek.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.560
It is. Can you come to the office?
We're ready to close.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.120
What's happened?

38:27.160 --> 38:29.720
Eleanor's on her way
to sign the deal with FramTek.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.000
Well then, you've won. Not quite.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.640
Well then, you've won. Not quite.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.520
I still have to get
Carl Wong's proof to the EU

38:35.560 --> 38:37.600
to make sure they approve the deal.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.000
And I'm going to give the memory
stick to a Guardian reporter.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.040
And I'm going to give the memory
stick to a Guardian reporter.

38:43.800 --> 38:47.400
What? This was delivered
to my office this morning.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.000
Liwei would never threaten me
like this.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.040
This is going to end.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.760
I promise.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.000
Thank you.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.960
Thank you.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.920
It's all on there?

39:39.960 --> 39:43.160
Why Damian Curtis and Kalim
Chowdhrey were murdered.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.000
How the British electorate
were tricked into voting "leave".

39:44.000 --> 39:46.960
How the British electorate
were tricked into voting "leave".

39:51.440 --> 39:52.000
Insider traders
make millions with it.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.600
Insider traders
make millions with it.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.840
If that's true, this is explosive.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.160
No one can know this came from me.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.640
The headlines
will speak for themselves.

40:07.680 --> 40:08.000
Watch this space.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.680
Watch this space.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.720
Shall we?

40:21.960 --> 40:24.000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

40:24.000 --> 40:24.680
Thank you very much. Thank you.

40:26.160 --> 40:29.400
El?

40:29.440 --> 40:31.400
It's signed, Massimo.

40:31.440 --> 40:32.000
We've fucking done it.
Well done.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.280
We've fucking done it.
Well done.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.880
I'm just about to meet Carl Wong.
I'll call you after.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.000
What the hell is this? A joke?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
What the hell is this? A joke?

40:42.040 --> 40:45.160
What are you talking about?
There's nothing on here.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.480
It's blank.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.000
No, it's not possible. There's been
a mistake, let me check...

40:48.000 --> 40:50.840
No, it's not possible. There's been
a mistake, let me check...

40:50.880 --> 40:55.680
I'm the one who made the mistake.
Thanks for wasting my time. Hey.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.400
I'll put it on the cloud.
That way it can't be erased.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.360
Thank you.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.800
Need a ride?

41:22.560 --> 41:26.000
Don't worry. Carl Wong isn't coming.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.520
Get in.

41:43.960 --> 41:44.000
Big day today?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.400
Big day today?

41:47.800 --> 41:50.360
It was Agnes Sharma, right?

41:50.400 --> 41:52.000
Someone got to her?

41:52.000 --> 41:52.400
Someone got to her?

41:53.400 --> 41:55.200
Trust no one.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.560
Where's Carl? Gone.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.600
What do you mean, gone?

42:01.480 --> 42:03.560
You disappoint me, Massimo.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.880
Mr Wong is on a flight
to New York City to join his family.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.200
He decided they were more important
than a lost cause.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
It's too bad you didn't make
the same decision.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.400
It's too bad you didn't make
the same decision.

42:23.320 --> 42:24.000
What's going on?

42:24.000 --> 42:24.720
What's going on?

42:24.760 --> 42:28.400
Please don't pretend you don't know.
At least show me that much respect.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.000
You knew that Massimo Ruggero
intended to acquire FramTek.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.680
You knew that Massimo Ruggero
intended to acquire FramTek.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.640
And you actively prevented us
from challenging him.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.000
I'm sorry.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.160
I'm sorry.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.320
Are you?

42:44.360 --> 42:47.320
My duty now is not only to you.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.000
Not only to China.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.480
Not only to China.

42:53.240 --> 42:56.000
Right, we won't pursue criminal
charges so long as you resign.

42:56.000 --> 42:56.680
Right, we won't pursue criminal
charges so long as you resign.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.120
Meaning you have no case.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.440
You betrayed the bank, Zhi.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.000
And you betrayed a friend.

43:04.000 --> 43:04.960
And you betrayed a friend.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.240
You have more than proven yourself.
Congratulations.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.840
Congratulations.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.880
I didn't have anything to do
with Kalim's death.

43:25.920 --> 43:28.000
Or Damian Curtis'.
But Rebecca did, didn't she?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.080
Or Damian Curtis'.
But Rebecca did, didn't she?

43:31.920 --> 43:34.680
Her men saw Kalim
take the memory stick.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.000
They didn't have to kill him.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.680
They didn't have to kill him.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.880
But they didn't give a fuck, right?

43:39.920 --> 43:43.560
So they had to do the same
to Damian Curtis.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.000
But maybe you didn't even know
about that until I told you, right?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.600
But maybe you didn't even know
about that until I told you, right?

43:47.640 --> 43:50.320
Even if that were true...

43:50.360 --> 43:52.000
you could never prove it.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
you could never prove it.

43:53.040 --> 43:57.320
Whereas the evidence against you
is rock solid.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.160
What are you talking about?

43:59.200 --> 44:00.000
Using Mikael Korhonen
as a front was brilliant.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.800
Using Mikael Korhonen
as a front was brilliant.

44:02.840 --> 44:06.280
And it was also money laundering.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.000
If you had the evidence
I went behind the FCA's back, yes.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.440
If you had the evidence
I went behind the FCA's back, yes.

44:10.480 --> 44:11.920
I have it.

44:11.960 --> 44:14.160
I had spyware at NYL, remember?

44:15.640 --> 44:16.000
The deal didn't go through.
Because you had Oliver unwind it.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.200
The deal didn't go through.
Because you had Oliver unwind it.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.640
I can prove intent...

44:21.680 --> 44:24.000
and conspiracy.
Fuck you, Dominic.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.640
and conspiracy.
Fuck you, Dominic.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.400
I know you're angry.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.760
And you're scared.
And now what?

44:30.800 --> 44:32.000
You and your friends
are going to kill me?

44:32.000 --> 44:33.760
You and your friends
are going to kill me?

44:35.120 --> 44:38.320
Me, Zhi, the baby?
What do you want to do?

44:38.360 --> 44:40.000
I sent those photos.
Not as a threat, but as a warning.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.080
I sent those photos.
Not as a threat, but as a warning.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.720
Run, Massimo.

44:44.760 --> 44:47.240
Run and never come back.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.000
Hey. Hey.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.880
That's all I could draw in
one go. Sorry it's not more.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.480
Thank you.

46:01.480 --> 46:04.000
Where will you go?

46:04.040 --> 46:06.280
I don't know.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.720
This is not going to be easy.

46:12.760 --> 46:15.160
I'm sorry.
No, it's OK.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.000
Here, take this with you.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.160
Here, take this with you.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.720
It's a girl.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.280
You'd better go.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.000
I'm going to fix this.

46:48.000 --> 46:48.360
I'm going to fix this.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.440
Be careful.
Thank you.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.760
In a sensational turn of events

47:07.800 --> 47:12.000
it appears that the CEO of Morgan
Atlantic Investments Massimo Ruggero

47:12.000 --> 47:12.200
it appears that the CEO of Morgan
Atlantic Investments Massimo Ruggero

47:12.240 --> 47:13.840
has fled the country

47:13.880 --> 47:16.440
before he could be arrested
on money laundering charges.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.600
Hillary Clinton has a 12-point...

47:18.640 --> 47:20.000
I didn't hear you come in.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.720
I didn't hear you come in.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.560
I came to say goodbye.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.440
I understand an oligarch
is buying my shares.

47:33.480 --> 47:36.000
Anton Kozlov.

47:36.000 --> 47:36.080
Anton Kozlov.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.920
Yes.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.320
I'm sorry it had to end like this.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.000
So am I.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.480
So am I.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.000
A data programme used
by the campaign

48:08.000 --> 48:08.040
A data programme used
by the campaign

48:08.080 --> 48:11.840
of the democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton was
accessed...

48:11.880 --> 48:14.880
During her Q
defended her judgement

48:14.920 --> 48:16.000
despite the e-mail scandal...

48:16.000 --> 48:16.680
despite the e-mail scandal...

48:16.720 --> 48:19.360
She has a 12-point lead
over Donald Trump...

48:19.400 --> 48:21.520
She lied to Congress
while under oath!

48:21.560 --> 48:23.640
This night is turning out to be
a real nail biter.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.000
Donald Trump
will carry the State of Florida!

48:24.000 --> 48:26.360
Donald Trump
will carry the State of Florida!

48:26.400 --> 48:28.920
They aren't surprised
he's heading for...

48:28.960 --> 48:31.800
For the Democrats, the move is
heading in the opposite direction.

48:31.840 --> 48:32.000
A result which
hardly anyone predicted.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.840
A result which
hardly anyone predicted.

48:33.880 --> 48:37.160
Donald Trump will
become the 45th US President

48:37.200 --> 48:40.000
after a stunning victory
over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

48:40.000 --> 48:40.720
after a stunning victory
over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

48:40.760 --> 48:45.240
I just received a call
from Secretary Clinton.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.840
She congratulated us.

49:11.360 --> 49:12.000
Game's over. You lost.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.960
Game's over. You lost.

49:23.080 --> 49:26.080
When you finish the game...

49:26.120 --> 49:28.000
the king and the pawn...

49:28.000 --> 49:28.320
the king and the pawn...

49:28.360 --> 49:30.760
end up in the same box.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.680
I'm shaking hands,
at the hospital the other night,

50:22.720 --> 50:24.000
where I think there were actually
a few Coronavirus patients,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.160
where I think there were actually
a few Coronavirus patients,

50:26.200 --> 50:27.920
and I shook hands with everybody.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.480
You'll be pleased to know,
and I continue to shake hands.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.000
When you do testing to that extent,
you're gonna find more people,

50:32.000 --> 50:33.440
When you do testing to that extent,
you're gonna find more people,

50:33.480 --> 50:35.120
you're gonna find more cases.

50:35.160 --> 50:39.040
So I said to my people,
slow the testing down, please.
