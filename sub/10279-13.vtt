E. R.

00:04.093 --> 00:05.286
Previously on E. R.

00:05.287 --> 00:06.425
Mark, she's out of control.

00:06.460 --> 00:08.726
- You need to stop lying.
- You don't believe me.

00:08.827 --> 00:11.580
- You search my room and private things.
- I was looking for drugs.

00:11.681 --> 00:14.681
I'm getting my job back
with the following conditions.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.494
I didn't agree to any conditions.

00:16.595 --> 00:18.347
- I failed your brother.
- Mom.

00:18.448 --> 00:21.025
He was tired before we left for France.

00:21.126 --> 00:23.765
It delayed the diagnosis
by less than a month.

00:23.866 --> 00:26.696
I just stood by while
it was eating him alive.

00:26.897 --> 00:29.819
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Shut your lying, filthy mouth!

00:30.020 --> 00:32.710
- Well, it's not the way it seems.
- Our walls are pretty thin, Joyce.

00:32.811 --> 00:34.846
Rachel, I want you to stay here.

00:49.608 --> 00:51.762
Chamomile tea?

00:51.939 --> 00:53.763
Feeling better?

00:53.979 --> 00:56.430
Well, I haven't been to the bathroom
in 10 minutes.

00:56.602 --> 00:58.923
I guess that's progress.

00:59.099 --> 01:01.384
- Hey, at least someone's happy.
- She should be.

01:01.556 --> 01:03.876
She T.P.'d the bathroom, the hallway
and half the kitchen...

01:04.012 --> 01:05.254
while I made tea.

01:05.427 --> 01:09.121
God. She's not even walking yet.

01:09.299 --> 01:11.453
- Did you take your temperature?
- Yeah.

01:11.630 --> 01:14.116
- But-
- Okay.

01:14.294 --> 01:17.325
- Should I call or do you want to?
- I'm presenting at grand rounds.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.164
- Not with the stomach flu, you're not.
- Mark.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.906
Hi, I'm calling for Dr. Corday.
Yeah, she's projectile vomiting.

01:24.077 --> 01:25.900
Do you still want her to come in?

01:26.075 --> 01:28.029
- Very funny.
- Thank you.

01:29.031 --> 01:32.278
I'm calling right back. I just need
loperamide. Then I'll be fine.

01:32.313 --> 01:34.729
What you need to do is stay in bed.

01:36.899 --> 01:39.385
- What about Ella?
- Katherine's coming over.

01:39.938 --> 01:41.808
Who's gonna look after her till then?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.262
I'm not doing anything today.

01:43.435 --> 01:45.968
- Hey, Rach.
- I can watch her if you want.

01:48.055 --> 01:50.091
I wouldn't want you to give up
your Saturday.

01:50.262 --> 01:52.795
- It's freezing out anyway.
- Sold. I'm late.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.255
You, stay in bed.

01:55.424 --> 01:56.797
Hello.

01:56.964 --> 01:58.834
Haleh, gallstone in 4 needs Toradol.

01:59.004 --> 02:01.040
Can you check the labs
on Cathy Jensen?

02:01.210 --> 02:02.583
- Upper GI bleed?
- Yeah.

02:02.751 --> 02:05.580
- Is Dr. Chen in yet?
- Nope.

02:05.956 --> 02:08.740
- Get the message he was looking for you?
- No.

02:08.912 --> 02:11.149
Oh, really?

02:12.284 --> 02:14.356
- In just a swim cap?
- Yeah. And a Speedo.

02:14.532 --> 02:17.148
- You've gotta try it.
- In January in Lake Michigan?

02:17.321 --> 02:20.103
- It has a spiritual quality.
- You wanted to see me, Robert?

02:20.276 --> 02:23.188
Yes. Just discussing with Dr. Lewis
what a tough year it's been.

02:23.357 --> 02:25.678
What with personnel changes, lawsuits
and whatnot.

02:25.855 --> 02:28.685
Can you believe Dr. Romano's a member
of the Polar Bear Club?

02:28.852 --> 02:29.929
Can you excuse us?

02:30.059 --> 02:31.172
Stay. I've found a solution...

02:31.350 --> 02:33.718
- ... for the administrative bottleneck-
- Bottleneck?

02:33.889 --> 02:36.922
- Your QAs are a month behind.
- Which you'll have by day's end.

02:37.095 --> 02:40.090
I'm sorry. Does she really need
to be here for this?

02:40.259 --> 02:42.827
Actually, I have a patient.

02:44.005 --> 02:46.867
- Well, that was elegant.
- Look, you can't expect me...

02:46.902 --> 02:49.166
...to do low-priority administrative work...

02:49.201 --> 02:52.035
...while I'm clocking more clinical shifts
than anybody in my department.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.594
You're overburdened.

02:53.629 --> 02:55.354
That's why I asked Dr. Lewis to pitch in.

02:55.489 --> 02:56.342
How?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.652
Covering meetings, overseeing teaching
in your absence.

02:59.065 --> 03:00.608
Which is what Chief Resident does.

03:00.734 --> 03:02.776
Carter's not an Attending. Dr. Lewis is.

03:02.947 --> 03:05.653
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm feeling unappreciated here.

03:05.827 --> 03:09.281
- I'm trying to lighten your load.
- No, you're not. You're jerking my chain.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.452
- Why would I do that?
- Because you can.

03:11.629 --> 03:14.999
Well, for the time being, consider
Dr. Lewis your unofficial assistant.

03:15.176 --> 03:16.505
No, I don't need any help!

03:16.679 --> 03:19.765
And try to keep the public displays
of affection to a minimum.

03:19.934 --> 03:23.020
This is a workplace, not a parade.

03:23.774 --> 03:26.730
- I have messages for you, Dr. Weaver.
- Thank you.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.486
So you're gay, huh?

03:31.663 --> 03:33.953
Yeah, Frank. I'm gay, all right?

03:34.125 --> 03:36.340
You know you're going to hell, right?

04:28.931 --> 04:33.178
- An entire bottle of wine?
- Topped off with a couple of Xanax.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.518
Was she embarrassed?

04:35.688 --> 04:38.974
Kind of hard not to be
when you're puking your guts out.

04:39.150 --> 04:42.400
- Know what the worst part about it was?
- You had to put her to bed?

04:42.571 --> 04:45.240
It was a 40-year-old bottle of Bordeaux!

04:45.407 --> 04:47.613
Is this a new thing?

04:47.993 --> 04:49.274
She's been taking them for years.

04:49.369 --> 04:50.401
Really?

04:50.579 --> 04:53.450
Mortality reviews.
It seems you get to finish them for me.

04:53.624 --> 04:55.201
- I guess.
- They're due by day's end.

04:55.376 --> 04:57.332
- Great.
- Should I have some soup sent over?

04:57.503 --> 04:59.791
- Is Elizabeth still sick?
- Yeah.

04:59.964 --> 05:02.336
Listen, if you change your mind,
call me, okay?

05:02.508 --> 05:05.509
And hang in there. Love you.

05:05.678 --> 05:08.133
She's been on the toilet all night.

05:08.306 --> 05:11.924
I'm not sure, but that may be more
than I need to know.

05:12.101 --> 05:15.019
So Romano conned you
into picking up the slack, huh?

05:15.188 --> 05:17.430
Oh, God! I agreed to help.
Was that stupid?

05:17.607 --> 05:20.857
A little bit around the edges.
Kerry's lucky to have you.

05:21.028 --> 05:23.649
I don't think she sees it that way.
She's never liked me.

05:23.822 --> 05:25.364
She doesn't like anyone.

05:25.532 --> 05:28.652
- Don't people work around here?
- Glutton for punishment, huh?

05:28.828 --> 05:31.235
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Oh, hi. Welcome back.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.287
- Yeah. To you too.
- Thank you.

05:33.457 --> 05:35.497
You're here.
I was hoping you'd come earlier.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.292
- Why?
- I wanted to acquaint you...

05:37.462 --> 05:39.370
...with the new forms for the CPT codes.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.172
I'll be fine.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.215
Suit yourself.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.710
Good for you, girl.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.724
You still owe me $20
for Cleo's going-away present.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.468
Suddenly I feel like I never left.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.761
You lost your locker. Keep your stuff
in here for the time being.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.476
Wait. There's dirt in here.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.525
No.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.898
It's doughnut sprinkles.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.764
Donald Brower, 35.
Face, neck and chest injuries...

06:06.778 --> 06:08.175
...from some sort of explosion.

06:08.203 --> 06:09.818
Unknown LOC, GCS 14...

06:09.996 --> 06:12.035
...hypotensive, 80 palp, pulse 130.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.328
Mr. Brower, can you hear me?

06:13.500 --> 06:15.741
- Can you tell me what happened?
- Mail...

06:15.919 --> 06:17.329
- Sorry?
- ... exploded.

06:17.546 --> 06:19.917
- What happened?
- He opened some kind of letter bomb.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.916
- Daughter's in that rig.
- Give it to me.

06:22.092 --> 06:24.499
Jessica Brower, 6.
Near amputation of right hand.

06:24.678 --> 06:26.635
BP is 100/70, pulse 120.

06:26.805 --> 06:28.798
- Estimated blood loss?
- Three hundred cc's.

06:28.974 --> 06:31.430
Couple of litres at wrist,
controlled with the cuff.

06:31.602 --> 06:34.093
I'm Dr. Lewis.
We're gonna take care of you, all right?

06:34.271 --> 06:37.439
- It hurts!
- Yeah, I know it does, sweetheart.

06:37.858 --> 06:39.898
- How's the airway?
- He's talking now.

06:40.069 --> 06:42.739
- GCS 14 here.
- BP, 80/40.

06:42.905 --> 06:44.530
Sir, can you see out of this eye?

06:44.741 --> 06:46.532
- I'll get it.
- What-?

06:47.786 --> 06:51.285
Peaked iris, probable globe rupture.
Follow the light.

06:52.416 --> 06:53.910
Decreased breath sounds on the left.

06:54.042 --> 06:55.205
He needs a chest tube.

06:55.377 --> 06:58.082
- Betadine and chest tube tray.
- This is her birthday.

06:58.589 --> 07:02.124
- Whose birthday, Mr. Brower?
- I let Jessica pull on the bow.

07:02.301 --> 07:04.542
Do you know why someone
would send you a bomb?

07:04.762 --> 07:07.087
- My wife.
- Your wife?

07:09.016 --> 07:11.305
- Mr. Brower?
- Sinus tach at 120.

07:12.144 --> 07:14.766
- Is that chest tube in yet?
- That's the pleura.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.936
- Open your eyes, Mr. Brower.
- Pressure's dropping, 70 systolic.

07:21.113 --> 07:23.899
- He's out. Vascular clamp.
- Another thoracostomy tray.

07:24.073 --> 07:25.319
I've got it, Kerry.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.948
I wonder how Susan's doing
over there with the kid.

07:28.829 --> 07:31.699
Okay, I'll put in the second chest tube
and you get the airway.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.659
Airway's fine.

07:38.672 --> 07:40.879
- Gram of Ancef, IV piggyback.
- Where are we?

07:41.050 --> 07:43.042
Superficial flash burns, face is fine.

07:43.177 --> 07:44.921
Lungs are clear, pelvis is stable.

07:45.095 --> 07:48.299
- All the money's on the hand.
- Pressure's steady at 100/70.

07:48.474 --> 07:51.310
No visible deformity
to shoulder or elbow.

07:51.978 --> 07:54.516
Hold on. We need to take a look
at your hand, all right?

07:54.689 --> 07:56.682
- Thumb's intact.
- First HemoCue's eight.

07:56.858 --> 07:58.103
Ring and little finger are missing.

07:58.235 --> 08:01.022
We need Hand Surgery, Ortho, Plastics.

08:01.196 --> 08:03.688
- Let the cuff down.
- Surgery'll be here in a minute.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.823
I said take the cuff down.

08:13.042 --> 08:15.793
Okay, Jessica. Okay, sweetheart.
You just relax.

08:15.962 --> 08:19.212
- Just need to know the exact injury.
- Well, now you know.

08:19.382 --> 08:21.873
- You want hemostats?
- Yeah.

08:22.052 --> 08:23.712
Just direct pressure.

08:23.887 --> 08:25.796
Blood supply intact. Probably salvageable.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.045
We're okay here, Kerry.

08:27.224 --> 08:28.422
Sinus at 100.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.639
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine, coags and-

08:30.769 --> 08:32.477
We already ordered pre-op labs.

08:35.941 --> 08:37.566
- Fine.
- Two more of morphine.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.652
- Let's get an x-ray tech down here.
- Carter, your mom's here.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.150
Brought a kid from her leukemia center.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.360
I got it.

08:43.532 --> 08:44.731
Yeah?
They come in on a rig?

08:44.909 --> 08:46.533
No. She brought him in herself.

08:46.703 --> 08:49.739
He has weakness and a slight fever.

08:49.914 --> 08:51.029
Thanks.

08:51.165 --> 08:53.454
And she's nicer than I remembered.

08:58.590 --> 09:00.666
Oh, John. Thank goodness
you're here today.

09:00.842 --> 09:04.543
- Who's your friend?
- Mickey is the center's Child of the Year.

09:04.722 --> 09:07.723
We were photographing him
for the spring mailer.

09:07.891 --> 09:11.177
And he suddenly became lightheaded
and warm.

09:11.354 --> 09:12.598
So you brought him here?

09:12.771 --> 09:14.930
We tried phoning his doctors,
but it's Saturday.

09:15.107 --> 09:17.266
Is there someplace else
I should have taken him?

09:17.443 --> 09:21.109
- Did they give him anything yet?
- Your friend gave him some Tylenol.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.403
- How long has he had leukemia?
- I'm not sure.

09:23.574 --> 09:24.654
He's been in remission a year.

09:24.784 --> 09:25.816
Call his parents?

09:25.993 --> 09:28.663
- He's an orphan.
- So he lives in a foster home?

09:28.830 --> 09:30.538
With three other special-needs children.

09:30.665 --> 09:32.492
And foster parents he barely knows.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.289
Hey, Mickey, how you doing?

09:35.462 --> 09:36.707
- Not so good.
- Yeah?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.964
We're gonna see if we can figure out
a way to make you feel better.

09:40.134 --> 09:43.218
- Okay.
- A private room would help.

09:44.722 --> 09:46.465
Swing your legs up there for me.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.966
Unit six going up. Pressure, 90/50.

09:49.143 --> 09:51.469
AC 12 on 100 percent.
Tidal volume 500,

09:51.604 --> 09:53.063
PEEP of five.

09:53.230 --> 09:54.974
- You holding up okay?
- Yeah.

09:55.149 --> 09:57.936
- Fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- You can't let Kerry get to you.

09:58.111 --> 10:00.567
And in the left pericolic gutter.
Where is Surgery?

10:00.739 --> 10:03.195
- Like riding a bicycle.
- Yeah, one with square wheels.

10:03.366 --> 10:05.739
- Ectopy!
- V-tach!

10:05.911 --> 10:09.779
Charge the paddles,
open a thoracotomy tray. Get ready.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.237
There's no pulse.

10:11.417 --> 10:15.165
He'll be fine. Charge to 200.
Clear!

10:17.465 --> 10:19.623
- Charge to 300.
- Ten blade.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.295
Clear.

10:22.845 --> 10:25.301
- Asystole.
- Go ahead. Open the chest.

10:28.601 --> 10:31.057
- A-positive is up. BP's 100/60.
- TKO the other fluids.

10:31.187 --> 10:32.659
- Bring another dose of fent.
- Jessica?

10:32.735 --> 10:34.271
- Are you her mother?
- Yeah.

10:34.366 --> 10:37.022
She's stable.
She's had extensive damage to her hand.

10:37.194 --> 10:39.233
- We need to get her to O.R.
- Can you hear me?

10:39.404 --> 10:41.812
We've given her pain medication.
She may not respond.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.064
- It's Mommy.
- Why don't you come to Pre-op.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.784
The surgeon will need to talk to you.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.026
Where's my husband?

10:47.205 --> 10:51.617
He's in there. They're working on him.
Mrs. Brower? Mrs. Brower?

10:52.209 --> 10:53.408
- P.E.A.
- Don?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.959
- V-fib.
- Oh, God!

10:57.632 --> 10:59.375
Shock him.

11:00.135 --> 11:02.043
You the wife?

11:03.722 --> 11:06.676
Your husband's injuries
caused his heart to stop beating.

11:06.850 --> 11:09.685
- We're trying to bring him back.
- A thoracotomy.

11:09.853 --> 11:11.396
- Charge again.
- You a doctor?

11:11.646 --> 11:14.054
- Researcher.
- Clear.

11:14.984 --> 11:17.901
- Still V-fib.
- Witnessed arrest.

11:18.070 --> 11:19.730
- Charge again.
- Ten percent chance.

11:19.905 --> 11:21.566
Clear.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.823
- I told him not to worry.
- Still V-fib.

11:24.994 --> 11:28.363
- Charge again.
- I told him it was safe.

11:28.539 --> 11:30.199
Clear.

11:31.877 --> 11:33.869
Agonal rhythm.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.671
He's been down for 30 minutes.

11:45.098 --> 11:46.759
You can stop.

11:46.934 --> 11:49.420
He's gone.

11:55.804 --> 11:59.756
- Are you being treated for your diabetes?
- Look, I'm blind.

11:59.791 --> 12:01.471
I'm not stupid.

12:01.647 --> 12:03.356
I do okay.

12:03.525 --> 12:05.852
It's not easy to get someone
to measure my insulin.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.818
But that's life.

12:08.993 --> 12:11.995
Look, you know, I'm just here
for the toenails, right?

12:12.164 --> 12:14.621
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

12:15.378 --> 12:17.336
You know, they're getting worse all week.

12:17.464 --> 12:18.960
I think it was the new shoes.

12:19.426 --> 12:20.969
When did you have them clipped?

12:21.138 --> 12:25.886
- Oh, April maybe.
- They're pretty overgrown.

12:26.062 --> 12:29.897
Well, listen. You think it's hard to get
someone to give you a sugar shot...

12:30.069 --> 12:33.072
...just try asking them to clip
these puppies.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.405
Well, you know, I can do that for you.

12:36.579 --> 12:38.977
Of course you can.
You're a gifted doctor.

12:39.209 --> 12:42.248
Or at least you will be.
Hold on.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.678
Someone smells beautiful.

12:47.723 --> 12:48.922
Bless you.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.772
- Hi, I'm Dr. Chen.
- I've heard a lot about you.

12:52.857 --> 12:54.103
I mean, good things.

12:55.111 --> 12:57.864
And the bad things
aren't really your fault.

12:57.990 --> 13:01.117
- Excuse me?
- Manny has a sixth sense about people.

13:01.288 --> 13:04.125
- Or so he says.
- Well, with my eyes...

13:04.292 --> 13:06.286
...I had to get something out of the deal.

13:06.421 --> 13:07.537
What is this?

13:07.715 --> 13:09.923
It's Mr. Kindlevich's Seeing Eye dog.

13:10.094 --> 13:13.132
- Well, where's his harness?
- He isn't official.

13:13.307 --> 13:16.560
But trust me. He's my eyes. I need him.

13:17.022 --> 13:19.266
All right. Just keep him on a leash,
a short one.

13:19.443 --> 13:22.481
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr. Chen, can I speak with you privately?

13:31.171 --> 13:32.880
What do you want?

13:33.049 --> 13:35.624
You know, eventually this has to stop.

13:35.803 --> 13:38.972
This attitude, this resentment
you have towards me.

13:39.143 --> 13:40.721
- Does it?
- We have to work together.

13:40.895 --> 13:42.438
I can't allow patient care...

13:42.564 --> 13:44.024
to be compromised
because you dislike me.

13:44.192 --> 13:46.102
- I wouldn't let that happen.
- Good.

13:46.279 --> 13:49.198
Because the last thing I need
is a divisive medical staff.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.160
Then maybe you should quit.

14:01.137 --> 14:02.881
The police want to talk to you.

14:03.057 --> 14:05.596
I told them to wait
until after your daughter's surgery.

14:05.770 --> 14:08.607
- Has it started?
- Yes.

14:10.236 --> 14:13.239
I should have told him about the threats.

14:16.037 --> 14:19.373
We're trying to create stem cells.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.120
Using embryos?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.337
DNA.

14:23.717 --> 14:25.757
Cloning.

14:26.763 --> 14:31.512
This was meant for me, not him.
Not Jessica.

14:40.202 --> 14:42.777
Could I observe the surgery?

14:42.957 --> 14:45.746
- It's probably not a good idea.
- I'm a doctor.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.246
You're also a mother.

14:51.430 --> 14:53.637
I'll see what I can do.

15:03.282 --> 15:06.534
- Easy, kid. Easy.
- Almost there.

15:06.871 --> 15:08.117
Hey!

15:09.334 --> 15:13.037
- Sorry about that.
- Damn medical students!

15:13.632 --> 15:15.211
He's all bark.

15:15.386 --> 15:17.594
You know, you remind him of his son.

15:19.226 --> 15:20.471
I'm black, sir.

15:22.815 --> 15:24.393
I can't see.

15:24.567 --> 15:27.405
Did you want two sets of cultures?

15:28.490 --> 15:32.990
- My best friend Eddie has the flu.
- Yeah. There's a lot of that going around.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.871
- We were shooting outside.
- It's freezing.

15:36.045 --> 15:38.454
I tried to tell the photographer.
He wouldn't listen.

15:38.632 --> 15:40.425
Abby is gonna draw some of your blood.

15:42.723 --> 15:45.809
- I have a good vein here.
- Okay.

15:46.395 --> 15:48.722
Take a deep breath.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.442
Exhale.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.693
You don't have to watch.

15:56.954 --> 15:59.079
I'm fine.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.460
Just a couple more vials
and we'll be all done.

16:05.261 --> 16:07.503
- Where are you going?
- I have other patients.

16:26.838 --> 16:30.458
Yeah. It's the head.

16:32.389 --> 16:34.466
You want to play with it?

16:36.395 --> 16:39.980
- Hi!
- Are you feeling any better?

16:40.152 --> 16:41.980
Hardly.

16:44.075 --> 16:45.700
- Is she keeping you busy?
- Yeah.

16:45.870 --> 16:49.205
I tried to get her down for a nap earlier,
but she wouldn't do it.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.423
Sometimes stroking her earlobes
helps lull her to sleep.

16:53.632 --> 16:55.294
Can I get you anything to eat?

16:55.469 --> 16:59.006
Oh, Rachel, I don't think
I can keep anything down.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.426
How about some tea?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.311
Sure. Sure.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.733
Hello, sweetie pie.

17:10.618 --> 17:13.028
Careful. You don't want to get her sick.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.534
Yeah.

17:16.713 --> 17:18.955
Okay. Why did I wear these shoes?

17:19.133 --> 17:21.970
- Because you forgot that around here-
- Comfort first.

17:22.137 --> 17:23.384
- Yes.
- No, I didn't forget.

17:23.557 --> 17:26.726
It's just I'm not ready to go back
to ugly, sensible shoes.

17:26.896 --> 17:30.398
I heard that you did some really nice work
in that trauma today.

17:30.569 --> 17:32.147
Doesn't count if they don't make it.

17:32.321 --> 17:34.114
Why did you treat pyelo with Bactrim?

17:34.283 --> 17:36.658
Because the PMD sent a culture
two days ago.

17:36.829 --> 17:38.788
I have the sensitivities.

17:38.874 --> 17:40.120
There's been resistance to Bactrim.

17:40.210 --> 17:41.289
Not for her.

17:41.420 --> 17:45.291
Well, if you don't have a culture, you start
with Levaquin or an aminoglycoside.

17:45.468 --> 17:49.385
- Hey, looks like you made a friend.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, knock it off.

17:49.559 --> 17:51.849
- Gallant, get this dog out of here.
- Thanks a lot.

17:52.021 --> 17:54.265
- This is a hospital, not a kennel.
- What'd I do?

17:54.442 --> 17:56.934
Tried to let her off the hook.
Whose side are you on?

17:57.113 --> 18:00.032
I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm trying to play this very neutral.

18:00.202 --> 18:02.955
No. You have to be on someone's side.
It better be mine.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.331
- Deb, she's my boss.
- You like her, don't you?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.460
I don't dislike her.

18:07.631 --> 18:10.634
- That makes a lot of sense.
- What makes a lot of sense?

18:10.802 --> 18:14.221
- Oh, your taste.
- Excuse me?

18:14.392 --> 18:17.098
John, it's obvious.
You have a thing for older women.

18:17.272 --> 18:19.431
- What?
- Yeah. Weaver, Lewis...

18:19.609 --> 18:22.066
...and, oh, that pediatric surgeon.
What was her name?

18:22.238 --> 18:25.491
- Oh, come on!
- Come on.

18:25.785 --> 18:27.495
Younger women just too much for you?

18:27.664 --> 18:29.040
I can handle myself either way.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.368
- Yeah, sure you can.
- Your mom's asking for you.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.670
- What do you want to tell her?
- Where's my kid?

18:33.841 --> 18:36.000
- I'm with a patient.
- What'd you do with my kid?

18:36.178 --> 18:37.459
- How's the leg?
- Much better.

18:37.639 --> 18:39.597
- What you got?
- Leslie, unrestrained driver.

18:39.767 --> 18:42.141
Slow-speed MVA.
Drove her car into some bushes.

18:42.314 --> 18:44.141
Found her and daughter on the curb.

18:44.275 --> 18:45.521
Only injury's a scalp lac.

18:45.693 --> 18:47.237
- Where's the daughter?
- Behind us.

18:47.405 --> 18:51.536
- Hey, Leslie. I'm Dr. Carter.
- Oh, I just bet you are, sweet face.

18:51.704 --> 18:54.742
BP, 130/80, no LOC.
And enough alcohol...

18:54.834 --> 18:56.893
- ...on her breath to start a fire.
- Hey, I resent...

18:56.987 --> 18:58.749
- Hi. What's your name?
- Stacy Miller.

18:58.924 --> 19:01.631
Thirteen years old. No LOC.
Says she wasn't hurt.

19:01.804 --> 19:02.919
We're gonna check you out,

19:03.015 --> 19:04.046
...make sure you're okay.

19:04.225 --> 19:06.764
- You feeling pain anywhere?
- Yeah, a big one.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.265
You guys a bunch of frigging perverts
or something?

19:09.442 --> 19:11.352
In my ass.

19:11.904 --> 19:13.150
Excuse me?

19:13.323 --> 19:15.234
- That looks pretty superficial.
- What?

19:15.409 --> 19:16.608
The cut on your head.

19:16.912 --> 19:18.906
There's a cut on my head?

19:19.417 --> 19:23.002
I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. You know-

19:23.548 --> 19:27.964
- Softer hands, honey.
- I'm sorry. But I ain't "honey.”

19:28.139 --> 19:31.261
Why is everybody so serious
around here?

19:31.436 --> 19:33.347
A pretty serious thing happened to you.

19:33.524 --> 19:38.022
No, no, no.
See, this is a bump.

19:38.198 --> 19:41.865
What's seriously wrong is
what's in here.

19:42.747 --> 19:44.705
You having chest pain?

19:46.128 --> 19:47.623
I have a broken heart.

19:48.048 --> 19:51.799
Two great weeks,
and he leaves me without a word.

19:51.971 --> 19:53.929
What the hell kind of fiancé is that?

19:54.099 --> 19:56.972
Trauma panel, urine tox and a dip.

19:57.146 --> 19:58.891
B.A.L. and hang a banana bag.

19:59.066 --> 20:00.644
- Suture kit?
- I'll get it.

20:01.403 --> 20:02.982
"Banana bag"?

20:05.201 --> 20:07.492
- Is that the daughter?
- Yeah.

20:07.997 --> 20:09.493
Lucky me, huh?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.542
Stacy,
we need to get you into a gown...

20:11.711 --> 20:13.504
...so I can examine your chest and belly.

20:13.674 --> 20:14.705
I said I wasn't hurt.

20:15.009 --> 20:17.846
You want to get out of here, right?
Go home, clean the house.

20:18.014 --> 20:19.565
Get your homework done.

20:20.894 --> 20:23.267
- How did you know?
- I'm very smart.

20:23.565 --> 20:26.652
Besides, the quicker you get into this,
the quicker you get out.

20:34.124 --> 20:35.868
At least you were being responsible.

20:36.378 --> 20:38.668
Mom says seat belts are too confining.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.464
Nice example to set,
driving drunk and beltless.

20:41.637 --> 20:43.797
She wasn't driving. I was.

20:43.974 --> 20:45.884
- You're 13.
- Almost 14.

20:46.060 --> 20:48.767
- You don't have a driver's license.
- Neither does my mom.

20:48.941 --> 20:53.570
She still drives. I just take over
when she's had too much to drink.

20:54.074 --> 20:55.902
You been doing this for a while now?

20:56.077 --> 20:58.570
Three years. Not one accident.

21:00.418 --> 21:01.878
Till now.

21:02.838 --> 21:06.590
Okay. We'll be right back.
We just need to get some more supplies.

21:09.683 --> 21:11.642
That is completely nuts.

21:11.811 --> 21:15.265
Or brilliant,
depending on your point of view.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.103
A 13-year-old driving
her lush mom is good?

21:18.281 --> 21:21.450
No. But neither is a lush mom
driving her 13-year-old around.

21:21.619 --> 21:23.614
Somebody's gotta be the adult.

21:23.790 --> 21:26.193
Everything was going along fine...

21:34.614 --> 21:35.809
Elizabeth, you awake?

21:36.778 --> 21:38.814
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. She's sweaty.

21:38.985 --> 21:42.762
- And she just started crying.
- Let me see. Let me see.

21:42.939 --> 21:46.349
- Did you give her milk?
- No. Just mashed bananas.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.343
Here, just take her a moment.

21:48.518 --> 21:50.839
I'll just get the thermometer.

21:51.016 --> 21:53.218
Oh, sweetie.

21:53.388 --> 21:55.839
How long's she been crying?

21:56.219 --> 21:57.841
Elizabeth, she just threw up.

21:59.341 --> 22:01.165
Oh, dear.

22:01.340 --> 22:04.619
- Oh, come here, sweetie.
- Maybe she caught what you have.

22:04.795 --> 22:06.251
Oh, it's okay.

22:06.418 --> 22:08.987
- What's this?
- What?

22:09.998 --> 22:11.241
- Get the phone.
- What is it?

22:11.414 --> 22:13.900
It's a pill fragment.
She swallowed something.

22:15.077 --> 22:17.362
Oh, my God! Her heart's pounding.
It's okay.

22:18.033 --> 22:19.524
Rachel!

22:19.698 --> 22:22.314
It's okay, sweetie pie. It's okay.

22:22.487 --> 22:26.181
It's okay. It's all right, darling.

22:27.691 --> 22:31.302
- It's all right, darling. Answer, damn it!
- Oh, my God!

22:31.479 --> 22:33.219
It's okay.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.348
- It's E.
- What?

22:36.017 --> 22:38.550
It's Ecstasy. I had some in my backpack.

22:38.848 --> 22:40.718
911.

22:41.179 --> 22:44.339
Yes, sorry. No, hold on. Hold on.

22:44.509 --> 22:45.705
- How many?
- What?

22:45.883 --> 22:48.878
- How many pills are missing?
- Just one or two.

22:51.045 --> 22:54.206
Yeah, sorry. I have a baby
with an amphetamine overdose.

22:54.375 --> 22:57.903
- What's your address?
- Yes. 1211 Dupont Drive.

22:58.080 --> 23:02.533
Please hurry. It's all right.
It's all right.

23:03.154 --> 23:05.147
DUI's a pretty serious offense.

23:05.323 --> 23:08.324
Yeah, but letting her sober daughter drive
was worse?

23:08.492 --> 23:10.900
I don't know if it's worse.
It's child endangerment.

23:11.078 --> 23:12.490
You gotta get Social Services involved.

23:12.622 --> 23:14.365
Stacy goes into foster care?

23:14.541 --> 23:16.332
That may not be such a bad thing.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.292
So you want to call the cops, or should I?

23:18.419 --> 23:20.210
Abby, we need to find Dr. Greene.

23:20.380 --> 23:21.624
Okay.

23:21.798 --> 23:25.878
- Abby?
- I'll take care of it. Oh, sorry.

23:26.052 --> 23:28.589
Sorry. I got a little busy there.
Has his fever broke?

23:28.763 --> 23:30.305
No. And he's very uncomfortable.

23:30.473 --> 23:33.723
- No one's given him anything to eat.
- I'll make sure he gets something.

23:33.894 --> 23:36.849
I talked to the Pedes Oncology fellow.
He's gonna come see him.

23:37.021 --> 23:40.390
- Aren't you going to do something?
- Yeah. I sent off his labs.

23:40.566 --> 23:42.606
No, I mean in terms of treating him.

23:43.653 --> 23:46.689
There's no obvious infection.
The oncologist can take it from here.

23:48.408 --> 23:50.864
It may be a while,
if you want to go home.

23:51.035 --> 23:52.281
I can't leave.

23:52.454 --> 23:53.948
His foster parents still can't get here?

23:54.080 --> 23:55.159
No.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.449
Somebody from the center
can relieve you.

23:57.626 --> 23:59.702
I'm from the center.

24:01.129 --> 24:04.498
Are you sure that you want to do this?
I mean, stay involved?

24:12.891 --> 24:15.298
Do you think she'll remember him?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.681
When my daughter was 6...

24:19.856 --> 24:23.225
...she broke her arm in two places
riding her bike.

24:23.402 --> 24:27.862
And the only thing she remembers
from that year is seeing Muppets on Ice.

24:28.364 --> 24:32.991
They remember the good things.
She won't forget her father.

24:35.246 --> 24:37.038
- Mrs. Brower.
- Yes?

24:37.207 --> 24:40.291
I'm Dr. Romano. I finished my part
of the surgery, which went well.

24:40.586 --> 24:41.830
Will they need to amputate?

24:43.881 --> 24:45.789
She's a doctor.

24:46.550 --> 24:48.838
There's stable bone
on the remaining digits...

24:49.011 --> 24:51.466
...blood supply and enough skin
to cover grafts.

24:51.639 --> 24:53.465
So she'll have use of the hand.

24:53.598 --> 24:55.721
Limited use. But kids can adapt.

24:59.813 --> 25:02.649
Corday and the paramedics
are on their way with your daughter.

25:02.816 --> 25:04.275
What?

25:04.443 --> 25:06.601
Came over the MICN
as an Ecstasy overdose.

25:06.778 --> 25:10.361
- Did they say how much Rachel took?
- All I know is, she's vomiting.

25:11.659 --> 25:13.782
- Is she awake?
- They didn't say.

25:13.952 --> 25:16.989
- Who didn't say?
- I didn't take the call. Haleh did.

25:21.293 --> 25:24.460
- What are her vitals?
- I'm sorry. I don't know anything.

25:24.629 --> 25:26.789
I knew she was doing this.

25:27.049 --> 25:28.792
I knew it.

25:29.217 --> 25:31.626
I should have trusted my instincts.

25:33.931 --> 25:36.089
I gotta take the stairs.

25:40.312 --> 25:42.021
- Move! Move!
- Sorry.

25:42.189 --> 25:44.561
I got the charcoal!
We need a Pedes ICU bed!

25:44.734 --> 25:47.403
- Where are they?
- Trauma 1.

25:47.569 --> 25:49.312
Move! Move! Move!
How's her airway?

25:49.488 --> 25:53.022
She's breathing on her own,
tachy at 180 and febrile.

25:58.372 --> 26:00.579
- Oh, God!
- She's diaphoretic.

26:00.749 --> 26:03.667
- Let's get a rectal temp.
- What the hell happened?

26:03.836 --> 26:06.327
- She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.
- What?

26:06.505 --> 26:08.047
I'm not sure how.

26:08.215 --> 26:09.924
She's sympathomimetic toxidrome.

26:10.051 --> 26:12.257
And we couldn't get a line in the rig.

26:12.928 --> 26:15.217
- Where was it?
- What?

26:15.389 --> 26:17.762
It was in her backpack!
She had four pills.

26:17.933 --> 26:19.178
Two have disappeared.

26:19.352 --> 26:22.435
And Ella vomited a fragment of one.

26:22.605 --> 26:28.359
Bolus 100 of IV saline.
Ten milligrams of charcoal by NG.

26:28.527 --> 26:31.398
- Prep a milligram of Ativan.
- They blew two veins in the field.

26:31.572 --> 26:35.321
- I'm gonna try an interosseous.
- No! No! She's got a good antecubital!

26:37.328 --> 26:39.154
- Oh, God!
- Heart rate's 250.

26:39.330 --> 26:41.370
Looks like a narrow-complex SVT.

26:41.499 --> 26:42.614
I need a glove full of ice.

26:42.791 --> 26:45.544
And prep one of adenosine.

26:45.836 --> 26:48.708
Dr. Corday, what is her weight?

26:48.881 --> 26:51.373
Ten kilograms at the pediatrician's
last week.

26:51.551 --> 26:54.635
Okay, here we go. Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

26:54.845 --> 26:57.337
- Twenty-four gauge in right AC.
- Push the adenosine.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.223
Lungs are wet. She's in failure.

26:59.350 --> 27:00.513
We need to break tachycardia!

27:00.684 --> 27:03.140
The CHF is rate-related!

27:03.438 --> 27:06.308
Could somebody get me a stool, please?

27:06.649 --> 27:09.484
- Still in SVT. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

27:09.652 --> 27:12.487
- Worry about my daughter!
- We're gonna need the crash cart.

27:12.655 --> 27:15.229
- What?
- She's hypoxic with pulmonary edema...

27:15.408 --> 27:19.358
...in SVT. The protocol is to synch
cardiovert at half a joule per kilo.

27:19.537 --> 27:22.906
No! No, we're not shocking her.
She's hemodynamically stable.

27:23.082 --> 27:25.075
Maybe we should get Dr. Weaver in here.

27:25.209 --> 27:26.241
No.

27:26.419 --> 27:28.875
Let's try two of adenosine.

27:30.423 --> 27:32.166
Abby, get Dr. Weaver.

27:34.469 --> 27:36.627
Mr. Kindlevich, you still being treated?

27:36.763 --> 27:37.925
No, discharged.

27:38.098 --> 27:41.632
Just waiting for the van to pick us up.

27:42.018 --> 27:44.936
- Stinky!
- Why don't you have a seat?

27:45.105 --> 27:47.774
Here we go. Just step straight back.
There you go.

27:47.940 --> 27:51.060
- He never leaves.
- Well, I'm sure he'll be back soon.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.979
Stinky!

27:55.364 --> 27:57.440
Stinky? Is that you?

27:57.617 --> 28:00.024
Stinky? Stinky?

28:00.203 --> 28:03.786
Oh, Stinky! Oh, Stinky.

28:03.957 --> 28:05.617
He needed to take care of business.

28:05.792 --> 28:09.291
Gallant, you're a student,
not a dog walker.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.870
- Bless you.
- I think I'm allergic to dogs.

28:13.633 --> 28:15.211
Apparently.

28:15.385 --> 28:17.010
Next time use a plastic bag.

28:17.137 --> 28:18.168
Dr. Weaver!

28:18.346 --> 28:21.217
They need you in Trauma 1.
Dr. Greene's daughter's in trouble.

28:21.391 --> 28:23.882
- Second round's onboard.
- Stats down to 90.

28:24.060 --> 28:25.555
Put her up to 50 litres of O-2.

28:25.728 --> 28:27.388
- Still in SVT?
- Yes.

28:27.564 --> 28:28.892
- Have-?
- Push 3 adenosine.

28:29.066 --> 28:32.481
Mark, we both know how difficult
it can be working on a family member.

28:32.652 --> 28:35.772
- Okay, get ready with diltiazem.
- And your own child in particular.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.154
- I got it, Kerry.
- No.

28:38.324 --> 28:40.946
- No, you need to step aside.
- I said I've got it, Kerry.

28:41.494 --> 28:44.277
Calcium channel blockers
can cause cardiovascular collapse...

28:44.456 --> 28:47.077
...and death in kids under 1.

28:48.168 --> 28:49.566
Mark.

28:53.882 --> 28:56.634
- Push one milligram of Inderal.
- You're soaking wet.

28:56.801 --> 28:59.008
- Please.
- Your pulse's thready. You have a fever.

28:59.179 --> 29:01.137
It's just gastroenteritis.

29:03.183 --> 29:05.757
- Sinus rhythm.
- Thank God!

29:10.232 --> 29:13.600
- Number 8 French NG for the charcoal.
- Let's get Elizabeth to bed.

29:13.777 --> 29:16.232
- And run in two litres of saline.
- I'm not leaving!

29:16.405 --> 29:20.354
If you don't, you're gonna pass out.
That won't help anyone, least of all Ella.

29:20.534 --> 29:24.911
She's okay. She's stable now, okay?
Go lie down.

29:25.080 --> 29:29.541
- I want to be able to see her.
- I'll set you up in Exam 2.

29:29.710 --> 29:31.998
- Damn it!
- Pulse ox is down to 88.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.412
Lungs are full of fluid.
Fifteen of Lasix.

29:34.589 --> 29:37.163
- Think about intubation.
- I can get her out of failure.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.335
- She's retracting.
- Using accessory muscles.

29:39.512 --> 29:40.756
She's in respiratory distress.

29:40.887 --> 29:42.797
Give the diuretics a chance to work.

29:42.973 --> 29:45.381
Put her in the Broselow tape.
Bag her on 100 percent.

29:45.559 --> 29:48.595
- No. You'll hyper-inflate the stomach!
- Mark, your baby is hypoxic.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.680
You want to avoid
unnecessary procedures.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.347
But if we don't intubate,
you're making a big mistake.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.016
- Now, step aside.
- Rate-

29:56.195 --> 29:59.729
The failure was rate-related.
We broke the SVT.

29:59.907 --> 30:01.734
But now she's in pulmonary edema.

30:01.908 --> 30:05.444
If this wasn't your baby, we would
have intubated her a long time ago.

30:05.621 --> 30:07.032
I'm trying to save her life.

30:13.129 --> 30:17.209
Pre-medicate with. 2 of atropine,
15 of lidocaine.

30:18.384 --> 30:21.587
Induce with 3.2 of etomidate
and paralyze with 22 of sux.

30:21.762 --> 30:23.138
- What size tube?
-4.0 uncuffed.

30:23.305 --> 30:25.879
- A number-one straight blade.
- Call for a Pedes vent.

30:26.058 --> 30:29.593
Tidal volume of 100 cc's.

30:31.105 --> 30:33.810
- We should be doing something.
- There's nothing we can do.

30:33.983 --> 30:36.818
They got three doctors.
I think we'd just be in the way.

30:36.986 --> 30:40.769
- Yeah. Did you hear how it happened?
- Yeah.

30:40.948 --> 30:44.780
It is amazing the drugs
that kids can get ahold of.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.651
Oh, my God! Is that Rachel?

30:51.876 --> 30:53.501
Yeah.

30:55.046 --> 30:56.706
John?

30:56.881 --> 30:59.917
Mickey's been upstairs an hour.
He hasn't been seen by a doctor.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.584
Yeah. That's not uncommon.

31:02.762 --> 31:05.134
Well, it's unacceptable.

31:05.806 --> 31:07.634
I was gonna get coffee.
You want some?

31:07.809 --> 31:09.967
Yes. I'd love some.

31:15.692 --> 31:18.895
I was hoping you could tell me
what all this means.

31:19.070 --> 31:21.643
- You stole his lab slips?
- Yes.

31:21.823 --> 31:25.772
I heard that they were back
but no one gave us the results.

31:34.377 --> 31:36.121
What is it?

31:36.796 --> 31:39.714
He's in blast crisis.
He's had a recurrence.

31:39.883 --> 31:41.840
His bone marrow's full of leukemia cells.

31:42.010 --> 31:44.964
He's not gonna be able to fight infection.

31:45.138 --> 31:49.088
- Is there something we can do?
- I'm sure they're giving him antibiotics.

31:49.267 --> 31:52.184
The oncologist will know
exactly what to do.

31:52.687 --> 31:54.846
Yes, of course.
But he's just a number to them.

31:55.023 --> 31:58.273
Maybe if you spoke to the doctors,
they'd take him more personally.

31:58.443 --> 32:00.519
Why are you doing this?

32:00.696 --> 32:02.023
You've been here all day.

32:02.197 --> 32:05.779
You've been holding his hand,
clipping his chart, bugging the staff.

32:05.951 --> 32:09.201
- I'm trying to help a sick child.
- Mom, he has leukemia.

32:09.370 --> 32:12.490
- I know that.
- And he may not survive.

32:13.207 --> 32:16.411
If you've got some kind of twisted need
to relive this, that's fine.

32:16.794 --> 32:20.495
I'm not gonna do it again.
I made my peace a long time ago.

32:25.762 --> 32:28.004
Let's pull the tube back five millimeters.

32:28.181 --> 32:30.850
- Are you in the main stem?
- At the carina.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.559
You should be in bed.

32:32.728 --> 32:36.226
Heart rate's down to 100.
Pulse ox is 99.

32:36.398 --> 32:38.023
When can we extubate?

32:38.191 --> 32:40.516
They'll probably keep her sedated
in the PICU...

32:40.694 --> 32:44.395
...rest her overnight in the vent and
extubate her first thing in the morning.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.857
Mark, we need them to get a rollaway
in the room.

32:48.035 --> 32:50.241
- I'm staying the night.
- Elizabeth, you're sick.

32:50.412 --> 32:52.570
- Well, you're not leaving, are you?
- No.

32:52.748 --> 32:54.372
Mark?

32:54.624 --> 32:57.460
- I found her wandering the hallway.
- Dad?

33:03.759 --> 33:05.301
Rachel, where have you been?

33:06.011 --> 33:08.965
I was just waiting outside.
Is she okay?

33:09.139 --> 33:11.381
Does she look okay?

33:14.937 --> 33:16.894
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

33:17.064 --> 33:19.898
- Mark?
- Stay out of this.

33:20.067 --> 33:23.068
You bring drugs into our house
and leave them out for a baby?

33:23.237 --> 33:25.110
- It wasn't mine.
- Stop lying!

33:25.281 --> 33:27.985
They were for a party.
I wasn't sure I was gonna take them.

33:28.158 --> 33:29.404
Your sister did.

33:30.202 --> 33:32.490
But she's gonna be okay, right?
It was one pill.

33:32.663 --> 33:34.241
Are you really that stupid?

33:35.416 --> 33:37.159
- Ella is 9 months old!
- I know.

33:37.334 --> 33:39.042
- She almost died.
- Dad, don't-

33:39.211 --> 33:41.832
Don't what? What? Don't call you a liar?

33:42.006 --> 33:45.173
Because that's what you are!
You promised you weren't doing drugs!

33:46.051 --> 33:47.082
I'm sorry.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.250
She could have brain damage...

33:48.429 --> 33:51.299
...learning disabilities, low IQ,
memory impairment.

33:51.474 --> 33:53.098
- She could still die!
- I know, Dad!

33:53.267 --> 33:55.971
Please, please, Dad. I'm sorry!

33:56.145 --> 33:57.686
Dad, I'm-

33:57.980 --> 33:59.260
Daddy, I'm sorry.

34:01.650 --> 34:04.183
Dad, I'm...

34:12.030 --> 34:14.864
- She still seems a little warm.
- We'll get a repeat temp.

34:15.033 --> 34:17.025
She can have ibuprofen by NG.

34:17.159 --> 34:18.190
I'll check the orders.

34:18.369 --> 34:19.614
Is this the overdose?

34:19.788 --> 34:22.574
Do we have a post-intubation film?

34:24.751 --> 34:25.947
I want someone else.

34:26.418 --> 34:28.328
Let's see how she's satting
on 70 percent.

34:28.504 --> 34:30.496
No, no, no. You're not touching her.

34:30.672 --> 34:32.713
- What's the problem?
- Page me another doctor.

34:32.884 --> 34:36.418
- There's no one else on service.
- If we're going to control toxicity...

34:36.596 --> 34:40.592
- ... we need to wean down the oxygen.
- Yes. Well, I want my own pediatrician.

34:40.766 --> 34:43.518
- Is this your daughter?
- You are not touching her!

34:43.937 --> 34:46.474
I have to. I'm the Critical Care Attending.

34:46.606 --> 34:47.721
No! No!

34:47.899 --> 34:50.139
You do not touch my child!
Do you hear me?

34:50.318 --> 34:51.860
- You stay away from her!
- Lizzie!

34:52.027 --> 34:53.938
- We have to check the blood gas!
- Get out!

34:54.114 --> 34:55.525
You heard what she said. Out!

34:55.947 --> 34:57.657
Get Dr. Rosato in here.

34:57.950 --> 34:59.362
Kerry?

34:59.535 --> 35:01.113
Yeah. How's she doing?

35:01.288 --> 35:04.454
Vitals are stable.
Satting well on 50 percent.

35:04.624 --> 35:08.251
- Sounds like her lungs are drying up.
- Yeah, we've got a long ways to go.

35:12.966 --> 35:15.172
My prayers are with you all.

35:16.803 --> 35:18.463
Kerry...

35:21.641 --> 35:23.550
...thank you.

35:33.403 --> 35:35.442
- Taking off?
- Yep.

35:35.614 --> 35:39.112
If I hang around here much longer,
I'm gonna start to cry.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.494
- Is your mom still upstairs?
- Don't know.

35:43.914 --> 35:45.705
Don't care?

35:46.999 --> 35:48.375
Hi.

35:48.543 --> 35:52.458
- Hey, I thought you left.
- I wanted to say thanks.

35:53.173 --> 35:55.877
The officer said that they'd book her
for the DUI...

35:56.051 --> 35:58.541
...but that I could post bail
in a couple hours.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.092
Wait. They're charging your mother
with the DUI?

36:01.264 --> 36:04.218
And I made an appointment
at that treatment center.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.558
- Great.
- But you were driving.

36:07.187 --> 36:09.677
- No, I wasn't.
- I thought you said she was driving.

36:09.856 --> 36:11.729
- No, I didn't.
- What?

36:11.942 --> 36:13.935
Anyway, I gotta catch a bus.

36:14.194 --> 36:15.771
Good luck.

36:18.740 --> 36:20.613
You said you were gonna call the police.

36:20.784 --> 36:22.277
You said I was gonna call.

36:22.411 --> 36:24.237
I asked, "Will you take care of this?"

36:24.412 --> 36:28.071
She's her mother's best chance
for recovery. I think you know that.

36:29.209 --> 36:31.996
- Good night, Carter.
- Good night.

36:41.346 --> 36:43.505
Hey, Gallant.

36:47.018 --> 36:48.892
Your guy's dead.

37:07.372 --> 37:09.080
Hey.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.627
Rachel's here.

37:23.472 --> 37:25.014
Did you call the police?

37:28.227 --> 37:30.100
She wants to talk to you.

37:36.443 --> 37:38.234
I can't.

37:40.238 --> 37:42.277
- Elizabeth-
- I'm sorry, Mark.

37:43.992 --> 37:45.819
I can't.

38:00.801 --> 38:03.718
Let's get you something to eat, okay?

38:07.974 --> 38:10.810
I want to stop by. But they probably
want to be by themselves.

38:10.978 --> 38:12.721
You want to go in on dinner for them?

38:12.895 --> 38:14.972
Have it sent over
so they don't have to leave?

38:15.148 --> 38:17.520
Yeah. That'd be nice.

38:17.734 --> 38:20.023
- Bye, Kerry.
- Bye.

38:24.157 --> 38:26.649
- Good night, Dr. Weaver.
- Good night.

38:35.001 --> 38:36.828
Stinky!

38:37.171 --> 38:39.329
What are you doing here?

38:41.508 --> 38:43.999
I've been trying to catch him.
He's running in circles.

38:44.177 --> 38:47.427
And he comes back here.
I think he knows Animal Control's coming.

38:47.597 --> 38:51.512
Oh, for God's sake!
Go inside and take an antihistamine.

38:52.644 --> 38:54.470
Yes, ma'am.

38:55.856 --> 38:58.014
Come here. I don't like dogs.

38:58.984 --> 39:00.691
And I don't like your name.

39:03.947 --> 39:06.106
Give me a break.

39:09.578 --> 39:12.532
All right, come on.

39:12.706 --> 39:13.987
You better be housebroken.

39:14.166 --> 39:17.534
Because if you're not,
you're going right back to the pound.

39:19.629 --> 39:21.955
- Who is it?
- Abby, it's me. Let me in.

39:22.132 --> 39:24.883
- Joyce?
- Please hurry.

39:25.052 --> 39:26.545
Hey.

39:27.346 --> 39:29.089
What's wrong?

39:29.389 --> 39:31.180
- Joyce?
- Turn out the lights.

39:31.349 --> 39:32.843
- What?
- Turn out all the lights.

39:33.018 --> 39:35.640
- Well, what's going on?
- I'm sorry. I had to get out.

39:35.812 --> 39:37.722
I hope it's okay that I came here.

39:37.856 --> 39:38.935
Well, of course it is.

39:39.107 --> 39:41.681
But- Joyce?

39:43.779 --> 39:45.902
Joyce, you in there?

39:47.657 --> 39:49.199
No, no, no, no. Don't go.

39:49.368 --> 39:51.906
He's probably just looking anyplace
he can think of.

39:52.079 --> 39:53.573
Open up, damn it!

39:54.497 --> 39:57.415
- I'm calling the police.
- No. It'll just make it worse.

39:57.584 --> 40:01.664
- He just needs to calm down.
- Joyce, you in there?

40:02.130 --> 40:04.917
Joyce, we can't hide in here all night.

40:05.175 --> 40:06.918
Joyce!

40:08.762 --> 40:10.422
He'll go away.

40:10.597 --> 40:13.883
- When?
- Open up, damn it!

40:14.851 --> 40:16.559
Bitch!

40:21.442 --> 40:22.984
I think he's gone.

40:24.069 --> 40:25.978
Can I stay here for a while?

40:27.823 --> 40:29.483
Sure.

41:17.539 --> 41:19.247
She's pretty tired.

41:20.501 --> 41:22.208
Okay.

41:23.504 --> 41:25.377
How you feeling?

41:27.216 --> 41:30.833
- Kind of better.
- Yeah? They treating you okay up here?

41:31.637 --> 41:34.175
They don't tell me much.

41:36.975 --> 41:39.098
They tell her mostly.

41:47.027 --> 41:48.901
You know what's happening to you,
Mickey?

41:52.741 --> 41:54.699
I know it's back.

41:56.829 --> 41:58.537
But...

41:58.998 --> 42:01.536
...I don't think it'll be as bad this time.

42:07.548 --> 42:09.837
I was by myself before.

42:42.875 --> 42:45.247
She looks asleep.

42:48.798 --> 42:51.039
But she's not.

42:58.765 --> 43:01.221
Hey, you want me to...?

43:01.393 --> 43:03.931
You want me to take over for a while?

43:04.105 --> 43:05.848
No.

43:21.205 --> 43:24.289
She is gonna come out of this.

43:27.420 --> 43:31.287
Well, she may not.

43:33.801 --> 43:37.169
She may never open her eyes again.

43:37.721 --> 43:39.595
Elizabeth.

43:41.100 --> 43:45.762
I don't understand
why this has happened.

43:54.905 --> 43:57.278
It'll be okay.

44:02.622 --> 44:07.034
Mark, you don't know that, do you?

44:16.219 --> 44:17.926
No.

44:18.554 --> 44:20.644
No.
