<i>Alice?</i>

01:17.392 --> 01:18.807
Hey.

01:18.807 --> 01:21.120
<i>Hey.
There you are. Good morning.</i>

01:21.120 --> 01:22.742
Good morning.

01:22.742 --> 01:24.261
Where are you?

01:24.261 --> 01:27.368
<i>Um, what do you mean?
I'm home.</i>

01:27.368 --> 01:29.266
It's 2:00 in the morning.

01:29.266 --> 01:31.372
<i>Yeah, I know, I couldn't sleep.</i>

01:31.372 --> 01:34.444
<i>I just feel, um...</i>

01:34.444 --> 01:35.755
<i>I don't know, I'm excited.</i>

01:35.755 --> 01:39.380
<i>It's a big day, I guess,
you know.</i>

01:39.380 --> 01:44.212
<i>Uh, John, he's good to drive
you back at this hour?</i>

01:44.212 --> 01:45.662
Yeah, all good.

01:45.662 --> 01:47.733
<i>We can't be late, right?</i>

01:47.733 --> 01:49.735
I know, trust me.

01:49.735 --> 01:53.773
<i>Yeah, they say she's the
best fertility doctor around.</i>

01:53.773 --> 01:56.155
<i>And also,
freeway's closed still,</i>

01:56.155 --> 01:58.157
<i>so it's gonna take you
a bit longer.</i>

01:58.157 --> 01:59.607
Yep.
Okay, I gotta go.

01:59.607 --> 02:02.196
I love you.
<i>- Okay.</i>

02:28.532 --> 02:31.259
So early.

02:42.236 --> 02:43.685
Hey, let's just...

02:43.685 --> 02:45.687
go back inside.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.483
Stop. Come on, drive.

02:48.483 --> 02:50.623
I need coffee.

02:50.623 --> 02:52.349
Yeah. Sure.

04:14.397 --> 04:16.847
Maybe you should answer.

04:16.847 --> 04:19.298
It's okay.

04:19.298 --> 04:20.920
Is it, though?

04:23.578 --> 04:25.442
He's gotta know something is up.

04:25.442 --> 04:28.065
No, he doesn't, trust me.

04:28.065 --> 04:31.552
Trust you.

04:38.869 --> 04:41.389
Take the 59.
The freeway is still closed.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.331
Gas light is on.

04:52.331 --> 04:54.506
I told you to fill it
last night.

04:54.506 --> 04:58.061
I did.

04:58.061 --> 05:00.960
What? I did.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.893
If we're late,
I'm gonna kill you.

05:02.893 --> 05:04.757
You know what your problem is?

05:04.757 --> 05:07.726
My problem is men thinking they
know what my fucking problem is.

05:46.903 --> 05:48.007
What?

05:48.007 --> 05:50.976
Company card?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.598
Thank you.

No, he shot it.

<i>Where are you exactly?</i>

17:57.391 --> 17:58.875
<i>Yeah,
there's been a shooting</i>

17:58.875 --> 18:01.395
<i>at the 24/7 FILL UP station
on Route 59.</i>

18:01.395 --> 18:04.295
<i>A woman's hurt over there.</i>

18:04.295 --> 18:07.850
<i>No, she's talking to me
on the two-way radio.</i>

18:07.850 --> 18:11.129
<i>No, I'm on the road.</i>

18:11.129 --> 18:14.339
<i>Hang on.</i>

18:14.339 --> 18:15.892
<i>Hey, they want to know
if he's an active shooter.</i>

18:15.892 --> 18:18.309
<i>Is he still there?</i>
- Yes, yes, he's here.

18:18.309 --> 18:20.656
Please just ask them
to send someone.

18:20.656 --> 18:24.280
<i>Yeah, she says
he's still there.</i>

18:24.280 --> 18:26.731
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

18:26.731 --> 18:29.182
<i>Well, how long?</i>

18:29.182 --> 18:31.391
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

18:31.391 --> 18:33.634
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

18:33.634 --> 18:35.395
<i>Okay, they're on their way.</i>

18:35.395 --> 18:36.879
<i>Operator said to stay put,</i>

18:36.879 --> 18:38.536
<i>should be there

18:38.536 --> 18:39.640
<i>Okay?</i>

18:39.640 --> 18:42.919
Yes, thank you.

18:42.919 --> 18:44.714
<i>God, I'm really worried.</i>

18:44.714 --> 18:47.303
<i>My wife should have
called me by now.</i>

18:53.896 --> 18:55.725
Can you please
stay here with me?

18:57.900 --> 19:01.386
<i>Okay.</i>

19:01.386 --> 19:03.388
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

19:05.494 --> 19:07.254
Thank you.

19:10.913 --> 19:12.777
<i>You know the man
who got shot?</i>

19:18.023 --> 19:19.956
Yeah, he's my friend.

19:19.956 --> 19:21.337
<i>Oh.</i>

19:21.337 --> 19:24.375
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19:24.375 --> 19:28.275
<i>Where were you guys
going so late?</i>

19:28.275 --> 19:30.864
We were driving home
from a convention.

19:30.864 --> 19:33.211
He's my colleague.

19:33.211 --> 19:36.352
<i>Oh, right. Convention.</i>

19:36.352 --> 19:38.941
<i>You guys work together?</i>

19:38.941 --> 19:42.738
<i>I can't imagine what
you're feeling right now.</i>

19:42.738 --> 19:45.568
<i>You think we should call
an ambulance?</i>

19:45.568 --> 19:47.743
I think he's dead.

19:52.851 --> 19:54.646
<i>Yeah...</i>

19:56.821 --> 19:58.616
<i>Because I blew his head off.</i>

20:06.796 --> 20:08.798
<i>You still there?</i>

20:08.798 --> 20:10.869
<i>Alice?</i>

20:10.869 --> 20:12.733
<i>Alice Germain Bach?</i>

20:16.289 --> 20:17.842
Oh, my God.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.395
<i>Just stand up...</i>

20:19.395 --> 20:21.397
<i>so I can see you.</i>

20:25.436 --> 20:26.816
<i>Fine.</i>

20:26.816 --> 20:28.611
<i>I'll come down there, then.</i>

20:35.308 --> 20:36.309
What do you want?

20:36.309 --> 20:38.311
<i>What do I want?</i>

20:38.311 --> 20:43.419
<i>Hm... What do I want?</i>

20:43.419 --> 20:45.559
<i>What is it that you want,
Alice?</i>

20:49.736 --> 20:51.600
<i>Huh?</i>

20:51.600 --> 20:54.361
I want you to leave me alone.

20:54.361 --> 20:56.605
<i>I think that's what
we all want.</i>

21:00.747 --> 21:02.542
<i>Alice?</i>

21:22.803 --> 21:24.288
Fuck.

22:40.916 --> 22:42.089
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

22:42.089 --> 22:43.884
Please answer.

22:48.544 --> 22:50.408
Hello? Can you hear me?

22:55.620 --> 22:59.417
Hello? If there's anyone
out there, please answer.

22:59.417 --> 23:01.039
<i>I'm right here.</i>

23:03.663 --> 23:05.596
Fuck.

23:07.563 --> 23:10.428
<i>Just me and you.</i>

23:10.428 --> 23:12.534
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

23:12.534 --> 23:14.501
<i>And my wife...</i>

23:16.745 --> 23:18.505
<i>Amelia.</i>

23:41.804 --> 23:42.840
Oh, my God.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.981
Oh! Oh, my God.

23:45.981 --> 23:50.157
<i>So hard to think of her
with another man.</i>

23:50.157 --> 23:52.056
Did I treat her poorly?

23:54.541 --> 23:56.681
<i>Abuse her physically?</i>

23:58.718 --> 24:00.478
<i>Did I abuse her emotionally?</i>

24:00.478 --> 24:02.929
<i>Or is everything abusive
these days?</i>

24:05.207 --> 24:07.899
<i>Did I not provide?</i>

24:07.899 --> 24:11.178
<i>No.</i>

24:11.178 --> 24:13.560
<i>She was probably just bored.</i>

24:15.804 --> 24:18.082
<i>Tell me.</i>

24:18.082 --> 24:19.980
<i>Are you bored, Alice?</i>

24:19.980 --> 24:22.776
I need a phone.

24:22.776 --> 24:24.088
Her phone?

24:41.174 --> 24:43.038
Fuck.

24:46.697 --> 24:48.630
<i>That's okay.</i>

24:50.770 --> 24:52.737
<i>You don't have to answer.</i>

24:56.810 --> 24:58.985
<i>We can take our time.</i>

25:00.124 --> 25:02.851
<i>What I know for sure though</i>

25:02.851 --> 25:05.232
<i>is that we're not
going anywhere</i>

25:05.232 --> 25:08.650
<i>till we're figure this out.</i>

25:08.650 --> 25:11.066
Fuck!

25:18.901 --> 25:20.662
Shit.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.914
Fuck.

27:00.727 --> 27:06.250
Fuck.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.771
<i>We seem to be stuck,
you and me.</i>

27:11.358 --> 27:17.088
<i>Cowering on the floor of
a dark and dirty gas station.</i>

27:17.088 --> 27:18.883
<i>What a waste.</i>

27:21.265 --> 27:24.717
<i>If you're not interested
in saving yourself...</i>

27:26.995 --> 27:29.307
<i>well, then, this is
how it all ends.</i>

27:38.869 --> 27:41.803
I've never done anything to you.

27:41.803 --> 27:45.254
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

27:45.254 --> 27:46.773
Who are you?

27:46.773 --> 27:49.327
<i>Who do you think I am?</i>

27:49.327 --> 27:51.951
<i>And more importantly...</i>

27:51.951 --> 27:54.194
<i>who the fuck do you think
you are?</i>

28:00.442 --> 28:02.237
<i>Alice?</i>

28:10.072 --> 28:12.765
<i>Come out.</i>

28:12.765 --> 28:15.837
<i>And I promise
you'll hardly feel a thing.</i>

28:17.183 --> 28:20.496
<i>One shot and all our problems
will be over.</i>

28:23.292 --> 28:25.294
Oh, fuck.

29:01.158 --> 29:03.781
Fuck.

31:38.487 --> 31:40.282
Amelia?

31:42.767 --> 31:43.734
Holy shit!

31:43.734 --> 31:45.356
Get down!

31:45.356 --> 31:46.737
What?
Get out of the doorway!

31:46.737 --> 31:49.084
There's someone
shooting in the store!

31:49.084 --> 31:51.535
What?

31:51.535 --> 31:53.088
Amelia?

31:53.088 --> 31:54.987
Where is Amelia,
the girl who works here?

31:54.987 --> 31:57.368
You need to call the police!

31:57.368 --> 31:59.646
Amelia?

31:59.646 --> 32:03.098
Where the hell is she?

32:03.098 --> 32:05.376
She's dead.
What the fuck?

32:05.376 --> 32:06.757
What the fuck?

32:06.757 --> 32:08.552
Listen to me.

32:08.552 --> 32:11.210
You need to call the police.

32:11.210 --> 32:13.177
Do you have your phone?

32:15.628 --> 32:17.492
Yeah.

32:17.492 --> 32:19.321
Good.

32:22.290 --> 32:24.775
Fuck. Shit.

32:24.775 --> 32:27.571
It's in the car.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.022
Fuck.

32:30.022 --> 32:32.024
Where are you?

32:34.785 --> 32:37.201
I'm behind the counter.

32:37.201 --> 32:40.308
If you go towards the
refrigerator, you can see me.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.560
What the hell happened?

32:51.560 --> 32:55.357
I just walked in here
and someone shot me.

32:55.357 --> 32:56.634
Where is Amelia?

32:56.634 --> 33:00.259
She's right here.
She's right here with me.

33:00.259 --> 33:01.743
Are you hurt bad?

33:01.743 --> 33:03.676
I don't know.
I don't know. It's my arm.

33:03.676 --> 33:05.160
You don't have a phone?

33:05.160 --> 33:07.024
No, and I can't find hers either.

33:07.024 --> 33:08.577
- What about the landline...
- No.

33:08.577 --> 33:09.647
...on the counter?

33:09.647 --> 33:11.580
It's not working, nothing is.

33:11.580 --> 33:13.203
Nothing is working.

33:13.203 --> 33:14.721
It's impossible to move around.

33:14.721 --> 33:16.309
He--
He can see everything.

33:16.309 --> 33:17.621
Where's he shooting from?

33:17.621 --> 33:18.794
I think he's shooting

33:18.794 --> 33:20.486
from the billboard
across the road,

33:20.486 --> 33:21.728
but there's an another door.

33:21.728 --> 33:24.007
I saw it
in the security monitor.

33:27.872 --> 33:30.841
The door to the garage.

33:30.841 --> 33:32.394
But that's locked at night.

33:32.394 --> 33:34.534
Well, is there a key?

33:34.534 --> 33:37.123
What the f...
What the fuck?

33:37.123 --> 33:39.056
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck?

33:39.056 --> 33:40.851
Hey, hey, listen to me.

33:40.851 --> 33:42.508
We need to stay calm, okay?

33:42.508 --> 33:43.716
We need to flag someone down.

33:43.716 --> 33:45.752
No one uses this road at night.

33:45.752 --> 33:48.272
Yeah, but you did.

33:48.272 --> 33:50.240
You think he's still out there?

33:51.896 --> 33:55.417
I don't know. He...

33:55.417 --> 33:58.558
He hasn't fire a shot
since you...

34:12.434 --> 34:14.264
Amelia...

34:14.885 --> 34:19.131
No, no, no, no.

34:19.131 --> 34:20.580
Oh, my God.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.591
She was such a good person.

34:36.734 --> 34:42.119
This is so fucked up.

35:06.454 --> 35:08.283
The only reason
she was working here

35:08.283 --> 35:10.285
was to help out her parents.

35:10.285 --> 35:12.908
They came from Mexico city
and bought this place,

35:12.908 --> 35:14.289
and then her mom got sick.

35:14.289 --> 35:17.396
- He said she was his wife.
- What?

35:17.396 --> 35:21.538
He said that he shot her
because she left him.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.643
Who?

35:23.643 --> 35:27.440
You talked to the guy
who did this?

35:27.440 --> 35:28.890
How?

35:28.890 --> 35:30.685
On that walkie.

35:34.275 --> 35:35.966
He said that she was his wife!

35:35.966 --> 35:38.624
No, he's-- he's lying.
That's not true.

35:38.624 --> 35:40.557
How do I know
that you're not lying?

35:42.904 --> 35:44.664
What do you mean?

35:47.529 --> 35:49.255
I'm being shot at all night,

35:49.255 --> 35:51.188
and the moment that you
get here, it all stops.

35:51.188 --> 35:53.604
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

35:53.604 --> 35:55.779
You think that I did this?
Hold on.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.574
Don't move!
Stay were you are!

35:57.574 --> 35:58.816
Stay away from me!

35:58.816 --> 36:01.233
Just calm down.

36:01.233 --> 36:05.306
This is crazy, okay?

36:05.306 --> 36:07.515
Then why are you
showing up at 3:00 AM?

36:07.515 --> 36:11.553
Because we both work
graveyard shifts.

36:11.553 --> 36:13.762
Sometimes I would come
in between deliveries

36:13.762 --> 36:15.557
and we would just...

36:18.836 --> 36:21.011
We would just talk.

36:21.011 --> 36:27.707
This country is so fucked up.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.778
Fucking racists.

36:29.778 --> 36:31.711
Guns everywhere.

36:31.711 --> 36:34.576
I can't take it anymore.

36:37.027 --> 36:40.582
And it's always innocent people
who get caught up in this shit.

36:43.723 --> 36:47.244
You don't-- You don't--
You don't believe me?

36:47.244 --> 36:49.626
Okay, fine, talk to him, then.

36:49.626 --> 36:52.284
You'll see.

36:52.284 --> 36:53.457
Go ahead.

36:53.457 --> 36:54.976
Tell him that I called the cops.

36:54.976 --> 36:57.392
He doesn't know I left my phone
in the car, right?

37:17.516 --> 37:19.311
We called the police.

37:19.311 --> 37:21.105
They're on their way.

37:24.971 --> 37:26.732
Try again.

37:30.529 --> 37:32.462
Did you hear what I said?

37:32.462 --> 37:33.842
We called the cops.

37:33.842 --> 37:35.741
You better
get the hell out of here.

37:38.985 --> 37:40.849
Try again.

37:40.849 --> 37:42.644
Please.

37:49.789 --> 37:52.447
Maybe he's gone. Yeah?

37:52.447 --> 37:54.415
- Go get your phone, then.
- What?

37:54.415 --> 37:55.795
Yeah, if he's gone,
go get your phone.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.901
No. I mean, I'm not gonna
go get myself shot

37:57.901 --> 38:00.006
just to prove
I'm not some fucking terrorist.

38:00.006 --> 38:03.320
I'm telling you, this is not me!

38:03.320 --> 38:05.736
I could never do anything
like this.

38:32.004 --> 38:34.006
I see it.

38:34.006 --> 38:35.939
My phone.

38:38.528 --> 38:41.013
Well, do you think
you can get it?

38:41.013 --> 38:42.635
Maybe if I...

38:42.635 --> 38:46.121
Maybe if I go around the shelves
to the other side.

38:46.121 --> 38:47.502
Yeah.

38:47.502 --> 38:49.090
You can use the car as a shield.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.059
Yeah, sure.

38:53.059 --> 38:54.889
Let's do it.

39:03.518 --> 39:06.452
Maybe we should just wait
a few-- maybe a little bit.

39:06.452 --> 39:07.936
The truckers start arriving
in a few hours.

39:07.936 --> 39:10.629
No, no, this is important.
This is the only way.

39:12.493 --> 39:14.702
You need to call for help, okay?

39:14.702 --> 39:17.187
Are you insane?
I'm not going across there

39:17.187 --> 39:18.775
and get my fucking head
blown off.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.052
If you're telling the truth,

39:20.052 --> 39:21.605
he's gonna be down here
any second.

39:21.605 --> 39:23.607
You need to call for help.

39:28.578 --> 39:30.511
I can distract him.

39:32.444 --> 39:33.893
How?

39:33.893 --> 39:35.619
There's a flashlight
under the counter.

40:01.162 --> 40:02.750
Okay.

41:39.053 --> 41:41.780
<i>You know the difference
between you and that guy?</i>

41:44.265 --> 41:46.992
<i>He was willing
to sacrifice himself...</i>

41:52.722 --> 41:54.655
<i>...while you survive.</i>

41:58.624 --> 42:00.868
<i>You put him up to it,
didn't you?</i>

42:06.598 --> 42:08.910
<i>What kind of a person
does that?</i>

42:12.327 --> 42:13.950
<i>Then again...</i>

42:13.950 --> 42:16.746
<i>what kind of person
does what I'm doing?</i>

42:28.723 --> 42:31.761
<i>I guess we both have a lot
to think about, huh?</i>

42:34.315 --> 42:36.075
<i>The way we've lived...</i>

42:43.945 --> 42:46.776
<i>The repercussions
of our actions...</i>

42:52.022 --> 42:53.921
<i>Who we've become.</i>

43:28.852 --> 43:30.785
Why are you doing this?

43:32.718 --> 43:35.445
<i>For the truth.</i>

43:35.445 --> 43:37.240
<i>Because I need the truth.</i>

43:42.348 --> 43:46.042
You sure tell a lot of lies for
someone looking for the truth.

43:46.042 --> 43:48.078
<i>Do I?</i>

43:48.078 --> 43:50.218
<i>And what about you?</i>

43:50.218 --> 43:52.220
<i>You were at the convention,
right?</i>

43:54.050 --> 43:58.295
I work for a pharmaceutical
company, so...

43:58.295 --> 44:01.367
<i>So...</i>

44:01.367 --> 44:03.162
<i>you're a drug dealer.</i>

44:08.823 --> 44:10.411
That's very original.

44:10.411 --> 44:14.001
<i>You know how many people
lost sons, daughters</i>

44:14.001 --> 44:15.347
<i>because of you?</i>

44:15.347 --> 44:18.971
<i>Your drugs,
your bullshit vaccines.</i>

44:18.971 --> 44:20.697
Fucking idiot.

44:20.697 --> 44:23.458
<i>All so that
you can get rich...</i>

44:23.458 --> 44:26.289
<i>with zero accountability, ever.</i>
- Sure.

44:26.289 --> 44:29.775
Do you know how many fucking
people's lives we've saved?

44:29.775 --> 44:31.743
<i>You think someone might
want you dead for that?</i>

44:31.743 --> 44:33.503
<i>But no, no, no.</i>

44:33.503 --> 44:36.023
<i>Instead, let's focus on
the microchips</i>

44:36.023 --> 44:38.819
<i>and Bill Gates
and all the anti-vaxxers</i>

44:38.819 --> 44:42.167
<i>so we all sound crazy
so you can censor us.</i>

44:42.167 --> 44:44.479
<i>So we can never talk about
what's actually going on.</i>

44:44.479 --> 44:46.827
What the fuck are you
talking about?

44:46.827 --> 44:48.967
<i>I'm talking about
the truth!</i>

44:48.967 --> 44:50.831
Yeah?

44:50.831 --> 44:54.973
<i>But you'd rather label us
so you can control us?</i>

44:54.973 --> 44:57.803
<i>You think someone might
want you dead for that?</i>

44:57.803 --> 44:59.253
<i>Do you?</i>
- Are you finished?

44:59.253 --> 45:01.048
Can I talk?

45:03.257 --> 45:05.880
I'm a VP of Marketing.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.226
Social media, okay?

45:07.226 --> 45:09.435
I don't make the stuff.

45:09.435 --> 45:12.991
<i>Oh, that's even worse.</i>

45:12.991 --> 45:15.787
<i>You promote it.</i>

45:15.787 --> 45:19.549
<i>You create the image.</i>

45:19.549 --> 45:22.276
<i>Filling young minds
with lies and deceit.</i>

45:22.276 --> 45:24.243
<i>Marching them to their deaths.</i>

45:32.044 --> 45:34.012
<i>How many people did you
have to step on</i>

45:34.012 --> 45:36.393
<i>to get such an important job?</i>

45:40.190 --> 45:44.885
<i>How many years
did you have to put in</i>

45:44.885 --> 45:48.267
<i>before you became
Vice President of Marketing...</i>

45:51.546 --> 45:53.928
<i>...at Phinzer Pharmaceuticals?</i>

45:57.967 --> 45:59.934
<i>I'll tell you how long.</i>

46:01.936 --> 46:05.181
<i>Two years,</i>

46:05.181 --> 46:08.080
<i>and you became VP</i>

46:08.080 --> 46:12.153
<i>of one of the biggest
drug companies in the country.</i>

46:14.638 --> 46:16.433
<i>God, that's amazing.</i>

46:19.264 --> 46:21.507
<i>I bet you didn't even have to
sleep with anyone</i>

46:21.507 --> 46:23.302
<i>to get ahead.</i>

46:28.307 --> 46:30.206
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

46:30.206 --> 46:33.105
<i>You don't need to sleep with
anyone to get ahead anymore.</i>

46:33.105 --> 46:34.313
Fuck you.

46:34.313 --> 46:35.970
<i>You can just accuse someone</i>

46:35.970 --> 46:38.593
<i>for something they did
when they were 12</i>

46:38.593 --> 46:42.597
<i>or a picture in blackface.</i>

46:42.597 --> 46:46.878
<i>Or maybe a boss came in one day</i>

46:46.878 --> 46:49.121
<i>and told you
how pretty you looked.</i>

46:51.641 --> 46:54.955
<i>Next thing you know,
he's gone,</i>

46:54.955 --> 46:56.370
<i>just like that!</i>

46:56.370 --> 46:58.130
<i>Piece of shit.</i>

46:58.130 --> 47:00.132
<i>Pig.</i>

47:02.272 --> 47:06.207
<i>Just because he said something
nice to a woman with ambition.</i>

47:13.594 --> 47:15.389
<i>Now he's out of a job.</i>

47:19.669 --> 47:21.947
<i>Can't make his house payments.</i>

47:25.123 --> 47:28.022
<i>And he can't take care of--</i>

47:28.022 --> 47:31.336
<i>of his little girl.</i>

47:31.336 --> 47:33.890
<i>You don't know what it's like
to hear a child</i>

47:33.890 --> 47:37.169
<i>screaming in the middle
of the night.</i>

47:37.169 --> 47:40.241
<i>To wait for hours
in the emergency room...</i>

47:46.972 --> 47:49.319
<i>...because her daddy,</i>

47:49.319 --> 47:52.081
<i>who's supposed to protect her,</i>

47:52.081 --> 47:55.015
<i>has no health insurance</i>

47:55.015 --> 47:58.328
<i>and is so...</i>

47:58.328 --> 48:01.159
<i>fucking helpless.</i>

48:06.440 --> 48:09.063
<i>You think that guy
might want you to kill you?</i>

48:13.619 --> 48:16.415
<i>You think that guy
might want you dead?</i>

48:18.590 --> 48:21.110
<i>All these deaths...</i>

48:21.110 --> 48:23.043
<i>could have been avoided.</i>

48:25.459 --> 48:29.049
<i>Because someone has to pay.</i>

48:29.049 --> 48:31.327
<i>Someone always has to pay.</i>

48:37.264 --> 48:40.508
<i>I'm tired of playing games.</i>

48:40.508 --> 48:43.649
<i>But all you wanna do</i>

48:43.649 --> 48:45.272
<i>is play hide and seek.</i>

48:52.348 --> 48:56.455
<i>One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,</i>

48:56.455 --> 48:58.250
<i>three Mississippi,</i>

48:58.250 --> 49:01.391
<i>four Mississippi,
five Mississippi.</i>

49:01.391 --> 49:02.703
<i>Who is Alice?</i>

49:02.703 --> 49:05.982
<i>Six Mississippi,
seven Mississippi.</i>

49:05.982 --> 49:08.364
<i>What did she do?
Eight Mississippi.</i>

49:08.364 --> 49:11.574
<i>Admit it, Alice.
Nine Mississippi.</i>

49:11.574 --> 49:13.334
<i>Ten Mississippi.</i>

49:13.334 --> 49:14.991
<i>Ready or not, here I--</i>

49:24.794 --> 49:27.590
<i>You don't get to
hijack this country</i>

49:27.590 --> 49:29.419
<i>and hide behind your lies</i>

49:29.419 --> 49:34.493
<i>and your fake news
and your forced mandates!</i>

49:34.493 --> 49:36.426
Please don't do this.

49:36.426 --> 49:39.671
<i>I'm not doing anything you
haven't been doing for years.</i>

49:48.818 --> 49:50.785
I never killed anybody.

49:50.785 --> 49:52.511
<i>Yes, you have.</i>

49:52.511 --> 49:55.066
<i>That's the whole point.
We're the same.</i>

49:55.066 --> 49:58.034
<i>We kill to protect
our interests.</i>

49:58.034 --> 50:01.451
<i>I'm just not blind to it
like you are.</i>

50:01.451 --> 50:03.039
We're nothing alike.

50:03.039 --> 50:05.593
<i>Oh, of course.</i>

50:05.593 --> 50:07.837
<i>You're woke,</i>

50:07.837 --> 50:09.563
<i>and I'm a psychopath.</i>

50:09.563 --> 50:13.049
<i>How convenient for you.</i>

50:13.049 --> 50:14.706
I never said that.

50:14.706 --> 50:17.640
<i>No.
But you wanted to.</i>

50:17.640 --> 50:20.470
<i>And yet, when I was sent
to Afghanistan</i>

50:20.470 --> 50:23.439
<i>and I was killing for you,
it was okay.</i>

50:23.439 --> 50:26.545
<i>When my friends died thousands
of miles away from home</i>

50:26.545 --> 50:29.100
<i>while the were killing for you,
it was okay.</i>

50:29.100 --> 50:30.791
<i>But now that you are forced</i>

50:30.791 --> 50:32.655
<i>to face the consequences
of your life,</i>

50:32.655 --> 50:35.623
<i>it's so much easier
for you to label me</i>

50:35.623 --> 50:37.694
<i>than it is for you
to face reality.</i>

51:00.683 --> 51:04.549
<i>But until you recognize
your part in all this,</i>

51:04.549 --> 51:07.897
<i>you'll never understand
why people like me exist.</i>

51:07.897 --> 51:09.450
<i>And we do.</i>

51:09.450 --> 51:11.107
<i>And there's a lot of us.</i>

51:11.107 --> 51:13.834
<i>You could be at school,
in the supermarket,</i>

51:13.834 --> 51:17.355
<i>at work, or even, uh...</i>

51:17.355 --> 51:20.841
<i>filling up your car
at a gas station.</i>

51:20.841 --> 51:22.256
<i>You wouldn't even
see it coming,</i>

51:22.256 --> 51:24.120
<i>and then suddenly...</i>

51:24.120 --> 51:25.742
<i>you're dead.</i>

51:28.745 --> 51:30.402
Why am I even talking to you?

51:30.402 --> 51:33.647
<i>Oh, because you want to
know who I am.</i>

51:33.647 --> 51:35.545
<i>And because you know
that every second</i>

51:35.545 --> 51:38.134
<i>I'm engaged in
this conversation</i>

51:38.134 --> 51:40.171
<i>is another second
I'm not coming down there</i>

51:40.171 --> 51:43.933
<i>to spill your brains
on that filthy linoleum floor.</i>

51:46.487 --> 51:49.870
Fuck.

51:59.190 --> 52:01.882
Get out. Get out.

52:10.822 --> 52:13.238
Fuck.

52:13.238 --> 52:15.275
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

52:15.275 --> 52:17.518
Fuck!

52:20.487 --> 52:23.386
Fuck!

52:23.386 --> 52:25.630
What the fuck, man?

52:25.630 --> 52:27.321
What's the hell?

52:27.321 --> 52:29.323
Get out of here.

52:52.001 --> 52:54.210
<i>See?</i>

52:54.210 --> 52:56.592
<i>Would a psychopath
have let him go?</i>

52:59.526 --> 53:02.770
<i>Although, if that guy had
better credit, he'd be dead.</i>

53:08.259 --> 53:10.364
<i>See what we've been reduced to?</i>

53:26.035 --> 53:29.487
You're not a bad guy. You...

53:29.487 --> 53:32.593
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have let him go.

53:32.593 --> 53:34.526
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

53:34.526 --> 53:37.322
<i>How many likes do you think
that will get me?</i>

53:41.671 --> 53:43.501
There's something
you should know about me.

53:43.501 --> 53:46.676
Something you wouldn't find out
on social media.

53:46.676 --> 53:48.437
<i>I'm listening.</i>

53:48.437 --> 53:50.439
We're trying
to have a baby.

53:52.717 --> 53:55.409
<i>And yet here you are
traveling with your lover</i>

53:55.409 --> 53:57.653
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

53:57.653 --> 54:00.414
<i>How could you ever have time
for children?</i>

54:00.414 --> 54:04.729
<i>No, you don't strike me
as the maternal type.</i>

54:04.729 --> 54:07.939
<i>You couldn't handle
the commitment.</i>

54:07.939 --> 54:09.734
<i>The pain.</i>

54:13.910 --> 54:15.774
You know nothing about me.

54:18.432 --> 54:20.745
<i>I know you
more than you think.</i>

54:23.541 --> 54:26.716
<i>I know you put yourself ahead
of everybody else.</i>

54:30.651 --> 54:33.033
<i>I bet there's even been
a couple of abortions</i>

54:33.033 --> 54:35.760
<i>along the way, huh?</i>

54:35.760 --> 54:37.555
Fuck you.

54:40.661 --> 54:42.456
Fuck you.

54:43.526 --> 54:47.358
You know nothing.

54:47.358 --> 54:49.083
<i>Why is that, Alice?</i>

55:01.441 --> 55:05.479
Because I can't have children.

55:05.479 --> 55:07.550
<i>Am I meant to feel bad?</i>

55:10.519 --> 55:13.038
<i>We both know you'd do
or say anything</i>

55:13.038 --> 55:14.799
<i>to save your life right now.</i>

55:26.742 --> 55:28.502
My life?

55:32.023 --> 55:35.509
My whole life has been
about pleasing men.

55:35.509 --> 55:38.409
My--

55:38.409 --> 55:42.171
My father,

55:42.171 --> 55:44.449
my husband,

55:44.449 --> 55:45.899
my boss.

55:55.840 --> 56:01.363
I'm sure you know what it's like
to never feel good enough.

56:07.748 --> 56:10.475
Do you know what it does
to a marriage?

56:21.728 --> 56:23.039
I'm...

56:23.039 --> 56:26.629
not having an affair
'cause I'm in love.

56:29.770 --> 56:32.773
I'm having an affair
'cause I'm in pain.

56:45.165 --> 56:47.616
And I love my husband.

56:47.616 --> 56:50.481
I'm--

56:50.481 --> 56:52.655
I love-- I love him.

56:58.661 --> 57:00.042
<i>That's so sad.</i>

57:02.285 --> 57:05.875
<i>So sad that it takes being at
the end of a gun for two people</i>

57:05.875 --> 57:08.740
<i>to finally have
a real conversation.</i>

57:37.320 --> 57:39.219
Yes, yes, yes.

57:44.983 --> 57:47.158
No! No, I'm here!

57:47.158 --> 57:49.298
No!

57:49.298 --> 57:51.127
Help! I'm right here!

58:07.074 --> 58:08.869
<i>Alice?</i>

58:12.355 --> 58:14.150
<i>Are you hiding again?</i>

58:28.924 --> 58:31.064
<i>Where are you?</i>

58:43.801 --> 58:45.561
Oh, my God.

58:55.640 --> 58:58.091
<i>Where are you, Alice?</i>

01:01:13.329 --> 01:01:16.125
Fuck!

01:01:26.066 --> 01:01:28.034
Oh, my God.

01:01:48.054 --> 01:01:50.297
<i>You can't run
from this, Alice.</i>

01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:54.336
<i>Not anymore.</i>

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.305
<i>Because there's
nowhere to hide.</i>

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.102
<i>Nowhere to go.</i>

01:02:05.174 --> 01:02:08.315
<i>That's the reason you ran
back in here, isn't it?</i>

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.995
<i>Alice?</i>

01:03:12.621 --> 01:03:14.968
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:14.968 --> 01:03:18.489
<i>Are you still with me, Alice?</i>

01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:20.284
<i>Are you still there?</i>

01:03:29.465 --> 01:03:33.262
<i>It's becoming unbearable,
isn't it?</i>

01:03:33.262 --> 01:03:36.403
<i>The pain.</i>

01:03:36.403 --> 01:03:38.440
<i>It leads to anger.</i>

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.338
<i>It leads to violence.</i>

01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:51.073
<i>Don't you feel a paradigm
shift in this country,</i>

01:03:51.073 --> 01:03:56.147
<i>toward selfishness
and brute force?</i>

01:03:56.147 --> 01:04:01.083
<i>Why is it easier for a kid to
buy an AR-15 than a six pack?</i>

01:04:03.154 --> 01:04:06.951
<i>That's because the DNA
to not give a shit</i>

01:04:06.951 --> 01:04:10.921
<i>is more desirable from
an evolutionary standpoint.</i>

01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:12.888
<i>Plain and simple.</i>

01:04:14.648 --> 01:04:20.171
<i>Do you think that the shooters
in Vegas or Florida or Buffalo</i>

01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:25.901
<i>or Uvalde or Sandy Hook
had any feelings of guilt?</i>

01:04:36.015 --> 01:04:37.982
<i>Do you think
I should feel any guilt?</i>

01:04:37.982 --> 01:04:40.985
<i>Do you feel guilt?</i>

01:04:43.091 --> 01:04:44.678
<i>If you don't believe it's wrong</i>

01:04:44.678 --> 01:04:46.473
<i>to do the things
that serve your needs,</i>

01:04:46.473 --> 01:04:48.268
<i>why should I?</i>

01:04:50.477 --> 01:04:53.998
<i>What do you think drives
the company you work for?</i>

01:04:58.485 --> 01:05:01.557
<i>Look at the thousands
of people you've harmed.</i>

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:10.049
<i>Who's worse?</i>

01:05:10.049 --> 01:05:12.016
<i>Who's done more damage?</i>

01:05:16.469 --> 01:05:19.506
<i>Just because you don't have
your finger on the trigger</i>

01:05:19.506 --> 01:05:23.579
<i>doesn't make you
any less of a killer.</i>

01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:27.756
<i>You don't care about people.</i>

01:05:27.756 --> 01:05:32.071
<i>All you really care about
is the money.</i>

01:05:32.071 --> 01:05:34.728
<i>And you'll do or say
anything to get it.</i>

01:05:34.728 --> 01:05:37.352
<i>Because money is freedom,
isn't that right?</i>

01:05:43.047 --> 01:05:45.118
<i>Freedom to do
what you want.</i>

01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:51.228
<i>To buy whatever you desire.</i>

01:05:54.231 --> 01:05:57.061
<i>Freedom to go
anywhere you please.</i>

01:05:59.029 --> 01:06:01.686
<i>But I think someone
said it best.</i>

01:06:01.686 --> 01:06:07.175
<i>"Freedom is just another word
for nothing left to lose."</i>

01:06:29.783 --> 01:06:32.062
Aah!

01:06:32.062 --> 01:06:33.995
Fuck!

01:06:38.758 --> 01:06:40.484
You fucking piece of shit loser.

01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:42.313
It's gonna take a lot more
than killing me

01:06:42.313 --> 01:06:44.315
to solve
your fucking problems.

01:06:44.315 --> 01:06:46.317
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:06:46.317 --> 01:06:49.079
<i>Or maybe it will make the next
person willing to spread filth</i>

01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:51.667
<i>and lies think about
the consequences.</i>

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.451
It's been a really
shitty couple of years.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:21.525
I'm angry too.

01:07:21.525 --> 01:07:22.836
I get it.

01:07:22.836 --> 01:07:24.769
And the media...

01:07:24.769 --> 01:07:27.255
does not help.

01:07:27.255 --> 01:07:29.774
Spreading conspiracies
all over the place.

01:07:29.774 --> 01:07:31.707
<i>That's the one.</i>

01:07:31.707 --> 01:07:33.882
<i>A conspiracy.</i>

01:07:33.882 --> 01:07:35.780
<i>I was waiting for you
to drop that one.</i>

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.162
<i>Best buzzword
to devalue anything</i>

01:07:38.162 --> 01:07:42.304
<i>I have to say
and label me as crazy.</i>

01:07:42.304 --> 01:07:43.857
Did you really lose your job?

01:07:43.857 --> 01:07:45.687
Is that what this is...

01:07:48.897 --> 01:07:50.657
...Henry?

01:07:58.424 --> 01:08:00.460
Did you really lose a child?

01:08:08.192 --> 01:08:10.643
Because if that's the case,
I'm--

01:08:10.643 --> 01:08:13.232
I'm really, really sorry.

01:08:15.786 --> 01:08:17.236
<i>Who's Henry?</i>

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:17.261
You got to leave.
You got to leave.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:24.889
Hey!

01:09:24.889 --> 01:09:27.202
Hey, get back in your car!

01:09:39.525 --> 01:09:41.320
Get out!

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.666
Get out of here!

01:09:42.666 --> 01:09:45.427
Car!
Call-- Call the police!

01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:52.779
Shit.
- Ohh!

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:54.402
Shit.

01:09:54.402 --> 01:09:56.369
Hey, get back in your car!

01:09:56.369 --> 01:10:00.339
Get out of the way!

01:10:00.339 --> 01:10:04.274
- Bob.
- Hide.

01:10:05.275 --> 01:10:07.380
No, move out!

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.729
What are you doing?

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.662
No, what are you doing?
No!

01:10:50.837 --> 01:10:53.771
<i>Well, that was touching.</i>

01:10:53.771 --> 01:10:55.808
<i>That's the kind of
sentimental crap</i>

01:10:55.808 --> 01:10:59.674
<i>that will die off
with that generation.</i>

01:10:59.674 --> 01:11:02.435
<i>What scares you most is
knowing that, deep down,</i>

01:11:02.435 --> 01:11:06.819
<i>we like it that way, because
you and I, we are survivors.</i>

01:11:06.819 --> 01:11:09.097
No!

01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:12.756
We're nothing alike!

01:11:15.966 --> 01:11:19.797
<i>You're in denial, Alice.</i>

01:11:19.797 --> 01:11:22.006
<i>The only reason
we're both still alive</i>

01:11:22.006 --> 01:11:24.768
<i>is because we share that gene.</i>

01:11:24.768 --> 01:11:30.083
<i>And it's that gene you'll pass
down to your unborn child.</i>

01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:32.707
<i>If you ever actually
get pregnant.</i>

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:42.717
That's exactly why
I can't have children.

01:11:42.717 --> 01:11:44.960
Because I don't wanna fear
for their lives

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.618
every time
they leave the house.

01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:52.520
Because I don't want them
bullied on their phones,

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.627
feeling unloved and alone.

01:11:56.627 --> 01:12:01.114
Depressed and bitter

01:12:01.114 --> 01:12:04.359
to potentially end up a coward!

01:12:06.982 --> 01:12:10.572
Hiding in the dark,
killing innocent people.

01:12:13.817 --> 01:12:15.370
I can't have children

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:19.857
because people like you
exist in the world.

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:23.067
But most of all,

01:12:23.067 --> 01:12:28.487
I can't have children because
it's my fucking choice!

01:12:30.109 --> 01:12:33.112
And it's the same choice
your mother would have made

01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:36.149
if she knew
what you'd become!

01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:52.649
Hey.

01:12:52.649 --> 01:12:54.892
Hey, get down.

01:12:55.652 --> 01:12:58.413
Hey, get down.

01:12:58.413 --> 01:12:59.828
Lay down.

01:13:03.453 --> 01:13:05.420
Grandma.

01:13:08.699 --> 01:13:10.839
Fuck.

01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:15.465
Listen, I know that you think
that by doing this,

01:13:15.465 --> 01:13:17.743
it's gonna give meaning
to your life, but it won't.

01:13:17.743 --> 01:13:19.227
They'll kill you

01:13:19.227 --> 01:13:21.609
or they'll cornered you
and you'll kill yourself.

01:13:21.609 --> 01:13:23.783
Just like all the others.

01:13:23.783 --> 01:13:25.440
And they're just gonna
write it off

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.890
like another shooting,

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:28.719
and people will send
their thoughts and prayers

01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:32.620
but no one will give a fuck
and nothing is gonna change.

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.518
<i>Oh, you're right.</i>

01:13:34.518 --> 01:13:38.971
<i>Nothing will change, because
I only exist in you mind.</i>

01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:41.767
<i>I'm your creation.</i>

01:13:41.767 --> 01:13:43.769
<i>I am your perception</i>

01:13:43.769 --> 01:13:45.564
<i>that you have
projected onto me</i>

01:13:45.564 --> 01:13:48.670
<i>so you never have to hear
the real reasons why.</i>

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:52.502
<i>No matter how justified,
I'm just a crazy shooter.</i>

01:13:52.502 --> 01:13:55.056

<i>election fraud,
domestic terrorist,</i>

<i>anti-vaxxer,
anti-this, anti-that.</i>

01:14:02.615 --> 01:14:07.102
<i>You label me and vilify me</i>

01:14:07.102 --> 01:14:08.794
<i>when all I ever wanted</i>

01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:10.934
<i>was to be left the fuck alone!</i>

01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.879
<i>Did you really think</i>

01:14:24.879 --> 01:14:26.984
<i>you could keep something
like that from me?</i>

01:14:29.953 --> 01:14:32.127
No, no, no, no!

01:14:32.127 --> 01:14:35.165
Fuck.

01:14:35.165 --> 01:14:36.960
Shit.

01:14:41.758 --> 01:14:43.898
Don't you dare shoot her, motherfucker.

01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:55.875
Wake up, Grandma.

01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.705
Wake up.

01:15:12.685 --> 01:15:15.239
Please.
Please, I'm begging you.

01:15:15.239 --> 01:15:17.966
<i>Begging is so beneath you, Alice.</i>

01:15:17.966 --> 01:15:21.936
<i>It's hard for me to believe
you really care.</i>

01:15:21.936 --> 01:15:23.972
Of course I care.

01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:26.803
<i>Enough that you would
trade your life for hers?</i>

01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:38.608
Yes, I would.

01:15:38.608 --> 01:15:40.161
Tell you what, then.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:42.612
Come out where I can see you clearly

01:15:42.612 --> 01:15:45.131
and I'll let her go.

01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:47.686
<i>How can I trust you?</i>

01:15:47.686 --> 01:15:50.689
How can I trust you?

01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:52.276
<i>Because I get it.</i>

01:15:52.276 --> 01:15:54.140
<i>I get it.
I learned my lesson.</i>

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.005
But what do you gain
by letting her live?

01:15:58.904 --> 01:16:01.147
<i>I get to save
an innocent life.</i>

01:16:03.356 --> 01:16:05.669
But if you sacrifice
yourself for her,

01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:07.775
then you'll be
teaching me a lesson.

01:16:13.159 --> 01:16:16.024
<i>Okay.</i>

01:16:16.024 --> 01:16:17.163
<i>Let's see.</i>

01:16:17.163 --> 01:16:19.614
<i>Tell her to run,</i>

01:16:19.614 --> 01:16:21.754
<i>and when she's out of range,
you come out front.</i>

01:16:21.754 --> 01:16:23.618
Put your gun down.

01:16:23.618 --> 01:16:25.586
<i>It's down.</i>

01:16:53.165 --> 01:16:55.857
No, no, no, no, no, no,
what are you doing?

01:16:55.857 --> 01:16:57.134
Go!

01:16:57.134 --> 01:16:59.205

01:17:16.982 --> 01:17:19.260
Shit.

01:17:45.873 --> 01:17:48.841
Don't worry, we're gonna
find a way out of here, okay?

01:18:20.424 --> 01:18:21.978
Come.

Listen to me.

01:19:09.819 --> 01:19:11.475
If you hear something
that's not me,

01:19:11.475 --> 01:19:13.823

01:19:13.823 --> 01:19:15.825
