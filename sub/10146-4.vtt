00:10.135 --> 00:11.177

00:13.430 --> 00:14.514
Fuck.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.028
What the hell?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.864
Fuck. Who the hell are you?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.700
The reason you're still breathing, asshole.

00:33.784 --> 00:34.867
Yeah, fair enough.

00:34.952 --> 00:35.952
We're with the agency.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.079
- Move it!
- Move!

01:04.147 --> 01:06.190
Damien. Damien, Damien!

01:09.445 --> 01:11.863
Move back. Move, kid.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.534
Move, move. Get behind me and start running.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.327
Get behind me.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.495
Run!

01:19.997 --> 01:21.914
- Get to the boat!
- Moving.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.587
Move, move, move!

01:27.671 --> 01:28.713
Go!

01:39.224 --> 01:40.683
Go, go, go!

01:51.737 --> 01:54.489
You just blew months of our work,
so thanks for that.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.283
So, what, the CIA's recruiting
out of South London now, are they?

01:57.868 --> 01:59.994
Funny guy. We're contractors.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.580
You're a couple of mercs, I tell you that.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.499
Yeah, mercs that just saved your life.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.795
Whereas you and your amateur crew
just screwed our entire mission.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.422
So what you gonna do about that, huh?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.217
It's Shiro.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.806
He ordered the murder of two of my mates.
And I want him.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.226
Now you can stand by me, or you can kill me.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.520
I don't really care.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.815
Because I'm not stopping until I get him.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.540
Come here. You okay?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.918
I think we lost 'em. All right.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.672
- Gotta keep moving. Let's go.
- Yeah.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.260
Hey, Finn, walk in the water.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.803
Walk in the water.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.889
- No prints.
- Right.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.516
You're really a soldier?

04:29.519 --> 04:31.812
Yeah, I am.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.357
I'm not a drug dealer.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.026
I'm definitely not an IT consultant.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.071
I'm a soldier.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.865
I'm really good at it, too.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.118
Come on.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.245
We'd better get off this beach, kid.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.706
It's too easy to see us.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.001
- Damien, hey.
- What?

04:54.086 --> 04:55.753
What about that?

04:59.383 --> 05:02.885
Hey! Hey! Over here.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.221
Over here, over here.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.807
Akiyama.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.998
The exchange can't be delayed.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.082
Section 20?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.751
They were grasping at straws.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.920
But we'll adjust our plans.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.923
Too much is at stake for both of us.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.722
And they said they were CIA?

05:48.098 --> 05:50.766
Yeah, here to render Shiro back to the US.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.103
- And do you trust them?
- No, I don't trust them.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.523
Why don't I bring them in?
Let's meet somewhere neutral.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.733
Roger that.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.283
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.493
The agency's finest.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.370
Mason and Faber.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.540
Philip Locke.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.960
Get me Izzy Fernandez in Virginia.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.338
CIA won't verify us.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.091
Oh, Izzy owes me a few favors.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.178
If need be, she'll verify.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.932
See, it don't matter
if you verify us or not.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.437
What matters is that you people
got in the way of our fucking mission.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.813
Hmm.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.114
No sudden moves, darlin'.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.994
Otherwise, I'll turn this cafÃ©
into a fucking bloodbath.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.830
Okay.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.835
Izzy.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.881
Do the names Faber and Mason
mean anything to you?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.346
You're brave.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.681
You did good.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.892
Why are you so calm?

07:15.352 --> 07:19.605
You just killed three people
and you're acting like nothing happened.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.067
Well, yeah, I did.
They were coming at us with guns.

07:23.819 --> 07:27.905
They would've shot us. Could've lost ya.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.325
Who were they?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.702
Looked like Yakuza.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.579
Never seen 'em before.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.083
Occupational hazard.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.878
Strangers trying to kill you
without introducing themselves.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.632
- You think this is funny?
- Yeah.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.219
You got to develop a sense of humor
to deal with that shit.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.889
Uh, no, you... No, you don't.
Normal people don't.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.100
How many...

07:57.102 --> 07:59.228
How many have you killed?

08:04.860 --> 08:06.068
You know what?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.738
I'm starting to think it was a good idea
you never stuck around.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.244
Look, kid.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.580
I know I'm an asshole.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.582
I ran out.

08:19.791 --> 08:24.879
And if I could, I'd run back 16 years
and kick my own ass.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.755
I deserve it.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.966
I don't blame you for hating me.

08:30.302 --> 08:35.097
What I don't understand is
why you came all this way just to tell me.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.768
You could've just picked up the phone
and said, "Fuck you."

08:42.647 --> 08:44.481
Roger that, Izzy. Thank you.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.486
CIA confirms.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.992
- So, what are your orders?
- Right now?

08:55.285 --> 08:59.163
To tell you to "back the fuck up,"
as my grandmama'd say.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.789
This is our op.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.499
Shiro is our target.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.251
Really?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.254
Tell me, where is Shiro? Hmm?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.465
I mean, you're the CIA.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.218
You know everything, right?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.267
Our priority is to stop
the Yakuza shipping vanadium

10:01.351 --> 10:03.310
on behalf of the North Koreans.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.771
After that,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.190
you can take Shiro with you.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.733
Deal?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.237
You know the MO.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.616
The sooner we bring in Shiro,
the bigger our bonus.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.621
All right.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.789
Martinez?

10:23.873 --> 10:27.751
Our intel suggests Shiro's operation's
being held at an aid depot

10:27.836 --> 10:29.211
about 20 klicks from here.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.465
It's part of Takagi's Kokura Foundation.
It's legit.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.718
No, it ain't.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.095
It's a front for Shiro's drug business.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.310
You asked me why I came here.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.858
See, my dad, Marcus,
he's always been there for me.

11:32.942 --> 11:36.320
Every time I mess up, he's always on my side.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.573
Your mom told me you messed up.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.743
Got wasted and stole a car on your birthday.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.580
No, Damien, I stole Marcus' credit card.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.875
I maxed it out, fuckin' blew the lot.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.086
I can't go back.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.298
Look, kid...

11:57.801 --> 12:00.969
People don't mess up
because they're bad or evil.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.849
They only mess up
'cause that's what people do.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.019
If your...

12:10.772 --> 12:13.023
If Marcus

12:15.235 --> 12:17.694
is as good as you say he is,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.280
he'll know that.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.201
You can go back.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.371
Trust me.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.711
What?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.756
What?

12:39.926 --> 12:43.470
It's my first piece of, uh, parental advice.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.349
I nailed it.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.185
Oh, fuck you.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.813
You're an asshole.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.189
Yeah.

12:54.983 --> 12:58.026
Well, a lot of people
would probably agree with you.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.163
Can I buy your phone?

13:14.878 --> 13:16.086
Here.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.965
- More, more.
- More?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.092
Great.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.663
Yeah?

13:51.748 --> 13:52.748
That all you got?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.333
Oh, Jesus. It's Damien.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.128
Where the fuck are you?

13:58.213 --> 13:59.630
Somewhere south of nowhere.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.423
And you're all right? Finn?

14:01.508 --> 14:04.760
Yeah. Both good.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.470
Why, you miss me?

14:06.804 --> 14:08.263
Oh, mate, terribly.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.892
Yeah. I'm tearing up.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.103
Hey, Mikey, I might lose the signal.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.106
- We got hit.
- Yeah, Yakuzas, we know, we know.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.775
The bastards are in bed with Office 39.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.861
Listen, we're on an op.
I'm gonna send you the grid right now.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.363
One second.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.031
What's the holdup?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.867
Who's that?

14:28.952 --> 14:31.537
It's just a couple of guys
we're working with.

14:31.621 --> 14:35.123
What? I haven't been gone 24 hours
and you're already replacing me?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.626
What, are you jealous?
It's not like that, trust me.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.504
Well, he's American.
Somehow that makes it worse.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.630
Did you get the grid?

14:44.968 --> 14:47.844
Yeah, just came through. Thanks.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.638
Mikey...

14:49.722 --> 14:51.682
Julia okay?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.725
Mate, I think she's moved on.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.269
Fuck you.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.896
Mate, we could use a little help here.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.526
Damien, Damien?

15:03.653 --> 15:06.154
Damien. Shit, lost him.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.449
Fuck, shit.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.162
Puen. Does this go any faster?

15:32.849 --> 15:36.602
Okay, Martinez and Richmond with me.
We have good visual on the road.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.608
Bravo One Team,
move to the warehouse.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.318
See if you can ID the vanadium.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.279
And remember, they don't know
we're here until we have eyes on.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.072
Okay, let's move.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.206
Fuck.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.683
Thank you.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.730
We've got to find some transport
and get back to my team.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.483
Hey, what about those?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.444
Funny.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.239
Who do you think I am? Hannibal?

17:12.323 --> 17:14.825
What's Hannibal Lecter got to do with this?

17:14.909 --> 17:15.992
No.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.204
Hannibal was a general who went into war.
Took an army.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.417
- Fought with elephants.
- Okay.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.171
Anyway, got something else on my mind.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.635
Great, stealing bikes. Nice.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.846
- No. Finn...
- What?

17:35.930 --> 17:38.432
We're not, I am.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.143
You're gonna get in that thing.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.979
What? No, hey! You're not ditching me again.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.481
Finn, I have to. All right?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.568
I won't be long, come on.

17:49.652 --> 17:53.196
You're gonna go back to the city,
find yourself a hotel.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.199
Contact me if you need to, all right?

17:56.284 --> 17:58.577
As soon as I'm done, I'll get back there.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.036
I promise.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.290
What if you don't?

18:03.791 --> 18:04.833
I will.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.588
People have been trying to kill me for years.
No one's succeeded yet.

18:09.672 --> 18:10.881
Here...

18:12.425 --> 18:14.926
That is for the hotel, all right?

18:15.011 --> 18:17.846
Not alcohol. Not girls.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.350
And that is not a suggestion.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.603
You hear me?

18:37.241 --> 18:39.701
Bravo One,
you got eyes on the metal yet?

18:40.161 --> 18:43.288
No, that's a negative.
There's water, rice, fertilizer.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.123
There's no vanadium here.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.794
Come on! Where's the metal?
It has to be in play.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.706
And in mine.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.417
My father knew that.

19:31.254 --> 19:32.879
And that's why he had to die.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.577
Eyes on Mei. This is it.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.788
Be advised, drugs are in play.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.061
- What is it?
- Check this one.

20:36.444 --> 20:39.154
If 20 comes, we're ready for them.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.669
Jesus Christ!
Mason's going after Shiro.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.714
Shit! He's not supposed to go after Shiro yet.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.176
Richmond, stop him before
he screws the whole thing up.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.223
Shit.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.903
You're not taking him
back to the US, are you?

21:19.987 --> 21:22.781
No. We're a kill squad.

21:22.865 --> 21:26.952
Ain't nothing personal,
but we plan on getting paid.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.972
Fuck.

22:01.654 --> 22:06.533
Mason, you pull that trigger,
you're dead before he is.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.884
You think the CIA gives a shit
about some Yakuza asshole?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.095
When North Korea's getting
its hands on long-range missiles?

22:27.304 --> 22:29.764
You think they're gonna
refuse to pay our employer?

22:30.516 --> 22:34.352
Our company's got
half the fucking Senate on a retainer.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.438
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.982
'Cause I could have killed you on that beach.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.156
Shit.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.325
I'm going after the trucks.

23:31.994 --> 23:32.994
Move!

23:40.336 --> 23:42.378
The vanadium has to be in the trucks. Pursue.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.013
Fuck!

25:19.727 --> 25:21.102
Come here!

25:26.358 --> 25:28.902
Where's the vanadium? Where is it?

25:28.986 --> 25:32.780
Mate, I'm gonna give you three seconds to
tell me or I'm taking you for a test drive.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.408
- Where is it?
- The drums.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.089
The drums. The drums are the vanadium?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.967
Oh, thanks, mate.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.309
Shit. Boss, I've got the vanadium.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.478
It's been melted down into the aid drums.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.482
- You know what to do.
- Yeah, roger that.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.192
Okay, come on.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.768
It's one truck down and one to go.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.395
I need a lift.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.896
Coming to you, Michael.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.162
We should go now.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.873
When 20 are here.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.943
You're willing to die for this, aren't you?

27:35.571 --> 27:38.239
Why? You're educated.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.034
You've seen things from the outside.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.453
You know the truth about your country.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.586
The West brought their cold war
to Korea,

27:51.920 --> 27:55.673
and used my homeland as
a battleground against the Russians.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.677
The South is still occupied
by 30,000 American soldiers,

27:59.762 --> 28:02.388
regularly demonstrating their military skills

28:02.473 --> 28:05.516
just to remind the North of their might.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.189
So whose truth are we discussing?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.882
Got multiple x-rays.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.177
But no sign of Mei.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.149
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.528
Oi, mate, one second.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.826
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.829
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Come on.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.665
You know it's going to take more than
a couple of bullets to keep me down.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.336
Look, now's not the best time to talk.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.172
But we're still on for that dinner.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.340
Sounds great to me.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.008
I'm coming home, baby.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.520
They're here.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.277
Looks like they're moving it by air.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.948
Well, let's stop them before they get a chance.

30:29.203 --> 30:30.995
Move, move, move!

30:39.546 --> 30:40.963
Moving.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.759
Move!

30:50.766 --> 30:51.766
Ah, shit.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.232
Okay, if we don't get past this,
we lose the metal.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.110
And then it really will be game over.

31:07.157 --> 31:10.785
Shit! We've got small arms fire
coming from 12 o'clock.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.621
Then do a girl a favor and take 'em out.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.040
Me and Richmond, we'll take out the truck.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.377
Okay, blow it apart. Nothing else matters.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.922
Boss! On me.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.508
Come on.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.870
Move.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.263
Clear. Martinez, go for the truck.
We're going after Mei.

32:12.389 --> 32:13.764
Copy that.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.445
There's the target.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.077
You draw them out.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.038
I'll take the truck.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.709
Okay. How much C-4 you got?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.294
Three sticks.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.255
That is definitely a four-stick job.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.757
Yeah.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.843
Ready?

32:52.346 --> 32:53.346
Yeah.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.581
Shit. Move, move, move!

33:25.962 --> 33:27.588
Boss, they're there, get down.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.559
Let's go.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.439
We're taking different paths now.

33:49.111 --> 33:52.947
I took this from your father
on the day you murdered him.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.245
I trusted you.

34:01.331 --> 34:02.832
Trust.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.545
That blood was your father's.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.005
He gave you life, and you took his.

34:11.925 --> 34:16.554
How could I trust a man who
betrayed his own father for greed?

34:19.683 --> 34:21.266
To get power,

34:22.143 --> 34:24.562
you need to make sacrifices.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.985
Power is a means to an end.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.157
Without reason, it's nothing.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.369
What I did,

34:41.036 --> 34:42.830
what I'm doing,

34:42.956 --> 34:44.498
is in the service of my people.

34:48.043 --> 34:49.545
What you did,

34:56.219 --> 34:58.846
you must decide if you can live with.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.437
Your father's legacy.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.023
Use it as you see fit.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.252
Shit.

35:47.604 --> 35:48.729
Fuck.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.734
Fuck.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.370
Fuck you!

36:42.242 --> 36:45.536
Mei is leaving. I repeat, Mei is leaving.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.121
She's taken Richmond.

36:54.129 --> 36:57.631
Everything you did was for nothing.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.139
Look, Scott.
Listen to me. They've taken Richmond.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.600
Fuck. Where?

37:07.684 --> 37:08.976
The grid reference I sent you earlier?

37:09.811 --> 37:12.688
There's a dirt road due south of it. Follow it.

37:13.315 --> 37:14.857
And, mate, hurry up.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.081
Run away and leave you, did she?

37:34.669 --> 37:37.838
You're too late. The vanadium's gone.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.011
What?

37:45.055 --> 37:47.306
All this noise, the gunfire?

37:48.350 --> 37:50.434
Nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.478
She knew you'd follow.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.688
She was counting on it.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.441
Martinez.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.277
You all right?

38:00.362 --> 38:02.488
There were so many, I should've...
I should've...

38:02.572 --> 38:03.989
Look at me, look at me.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.699
You were doing your job,
you were following orders.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.451
But I gave the order.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.703
I told her... I told her to draw them out.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.374
Where's the metal?

38:15.919 --> 38:17.628
Where's she gone?

38:21.216 --> 38:22.883
Go ahead.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.677
That bullet is my father's.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.689
She had you kill him, didn't she? Hmm?

38:36.773 --> 38:38.065
Why?

38:38.733 --> 38:39.984
Why?

38:40.068 --> 38:42.486
Because he wouldn't do the deal?

38:45.198 --> 38:47.241
My family is from Kokura.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.495
The city the Americans
planned to drop the atomic bomb on.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.750
That's why my father
wouldn't help the North Koreans.

38:58.753 --> 39:02.506
Why he chose compassion over duty.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.301
Help me stop her.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.513
You do that,

39:11.933 --> 39:13.434
I'll give you this.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.937
Where's the metal?

39:22.235 --> 39:24.278
Being taken to the...

39:24.362 --> 39:25.362
No!

39:50.555 --> 39:54.391
In a few hours,
the vanadium will be in North Korea.

39:54.476 --> 39:57.394
And all that you did will be for nothing.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.147
Everything you gave.

40:09.449 --> 40:14.328
I'm impressed by you and your team.
That is why I have to be sure.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.499
What do 20 know about
what we have planned?

40:24.672 --> 40:26.381
Julia Richmond.

40:27.801 --> 40:29.176
Sergeant.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.387
Service number,

40:33.139 --> 40:34.556
2-5-1-3...

40:36.142 --> 40:38.477
0-5-8-1.

40:38.561 --> 40:41.688
All you have to do is tell me, Julia.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.025
What intel you have, what suspicion.

40:45.568 --> 40:49.363
If you do this for me, I will let you live.

40:56.538 --> 40:59.039
Do you have anything to live for?

40:59.916 --> 41:01.166
Anyone?

41:19.936 --> 41:21.478
Yes.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.733
Yes, I do.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.494
We're not that different.

41:38.121 --> 41:41.748
We are both soldiers
fighting for what we believe in.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.752
I have no desire to kill you.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.173
Julia Richmond.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.175
Sergeant.

41:52.343 --> 41:58.932
Service number, 2-5-1-3-0-5-8-1.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.370
He'll come for you.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.210
There's nowhere you can hide.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.504
What happens to me is not important.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.634
You're not scared to die?

42:50.568 --> 42:52.778
I always knew I would die like this.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.825
In a place like this.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.540
I just never knew who would pull the trigger.

45:14.796 --> 45:16.254
You've done well.

45:16.339 --> 45:18.590
I'm sure the council will reward you.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.638
Time to go home.
