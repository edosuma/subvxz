WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.716
Very still now.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.220
That's it. You can get through this.
Imagine them naked.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.805
That's exactly what they're doing to you.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.683
How can a mother and a wife--

00:16.767 --> 00:19.102
Not to mention
a representative of this company.

00:19.186 --> 00:23.315
How does a woman with
your responsibilities possibly justify

00:23.398 --> 00:25.609
engaging in that sort of behavior?

00:34.117 --> 00:38.080
Are you expecting an answer to that or…

00:39.498 --> 00:42.209
Who do you think saw fit
to send us this tape?

00:42.292 --> 00:43.502
I did, moron.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.505
I have no idea. I--

00:46.588 --> 00:49.216
Is this a habit of yours, Miss Rubin?

00:50.175 --> 00:53.512
An activity you engage in with regularity?

00:54.972 --> 00:55.973
You mean…

00:56.056 --> 00:58.100
Just say it. They all do it.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.019
-Masturbating?
-Public masturbating!

01:01.103 --> 01:04.313
Needless to say, this complicates
your relationship with the company.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.901
It destroys it.
Doesn't she know this is a family company?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.321
-This is a family company.
-Yes.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.491
And she was aware of
the morality clause in her contract?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.034
I can't say for certain that--

01:16.118 --> 01:18.537
There is a morality clause
in your contract.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.290
Remember you had no idea. Sell it.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.334
Which, given the nature of your behavior,

01:24.418 --> 01:28.505
the very public nature of your behavior,
gives us the right

01:28.589 --> 01:32.217
to terminate our agreement with you
effective immediately.

01:34.052 --> 01:37.556
Dad's funeral.
No, no. Maya's funeral. That's it.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.308
Squeeze out a tear.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.520
Well, I'm very sorry…
that I've let you all down.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.275
And I'll be doing a lot of
soul-searching over the next few months.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.699
We're very sorry to see you go.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.452
You had such growth potential.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.371
And we don't want this here.

02:05.334 --> 02:09.713
And the Oscar goes to me
for that performance.

02:09.795 --> 02:13.592
You did it! You're free.
Now, let's get out of this morgue.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.718
But first…

02:20.682 --> 02:23.185
-Hello?
-Hi, it's me. It's Sheila.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.436
Hi!

02:24.520 --> 02:25.896
-It's her! Hey.
-Great.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.773
I'm sorry I've been out of touch. I--

02:27.856 --> 02:29.691
No, stop. Please don't be. I'm sorry.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.110
Can I take you to lunch?

02:32.194 --> 02:36.490
I got a lot of changes I'd love to discuss
with you. Ki's, one o'clock?

02:37.783 --> 02:40.827
Yeah, of course. Ciao.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.038
Ciao?

02:45.791 --> 02:46.792
So?

02:50.963 --> 02:52.589
She wants to go to lunch.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.882
That's great, babe!

02:55.133 --> 02:58.929
She's gonna break up with me
in a public place so I can't cry.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.431
And I'm gonna pick up the check.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.516
We made it weird!

03:03.600 --> 03:06.937
Friends don't plunge their sex parts
into each other, Ernie!

03:08.730 --> 03:12.150
Friends give each other space to--
to be themselves.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.403
Sheila barely gives herself space.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.488
You have to face it. We made it weird.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.333
We are praying for you, dear.

03:28.417 --> 03:32.129
Whatever happens to Maria
and that little angel, God is with them.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.049
Thank you, Aunt Lillian.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.054
Hey, Dad,
I think it's time for the blessing.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.100
-Are you gonna say it?
-I would prefer not to.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.522
Okay.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.204
Let us pray.

04:08.874 --> 04:12.294
Dear Heavenly Father,
we would like to thank thee

04:12.377 --> 04:15.130
-for the food that has been provided…
-Don't punish them.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.964
…and for the hands
that have prepared that food.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.677
-Don't punish them. Don't punish them.
-We ask thee to bless it.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.971
Don't punish them. I caused this.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.307
May it nourish
and strengthen our bodies.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.893
I caused this. Don't punish them.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.979
In Jesus Christ's name, we pray. Amen.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.481
I caused this. Don't punish them.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.574
-Amen.
-Amen.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.086
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.338
-Hey.
-What's going on?

04:56.839 --> 04:58.715
Could you come sit down? Please?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.051
-I'm kind of in a hurry.
-It'll just be a second.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.928
Oh, no. What the hell is this?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.304
Please.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.487
I'm not saying anything…

05:22.573 --> 05:25.784
but there is a place

05:27.703 --> 05:29.746
where you can go and…

05:32.416 --> 05:33.959
they have programs.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.131
Three days. More.

05:40.090 --> 05:46.346
And you can talk to people
about these issues…

05:48.599 --> 05:49.600
to get some help.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.067
But I'm not saying anything,
and I'm the one walking out for once.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.134
You know what this is.
You know what he's trying to do.

06:24.218 --> 06:28.305
He's trying to stop you from moving up,
from moving on, from moving at all.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.433
He wants you to give up, and give in,
and get fat and lazy.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.444
So, what did you wanna talk about?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.072
Right. Well,

06:46.073 --> 06:50.244
there's been a few changes since
we've last seen each other.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.789
Big changes. Not just with Danny.

06:53.872 --> 06:58.335
And you know how greatly I value you
as a friend.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.755
So I don't say this lightly,

07:01.839 --> 07:06.760
but to evolve, we have to face discomfort.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.849
Would you wanna go into business with me?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.809
I know it would change things between us,

07:13.892 --> 07:17.020
and there's always risks bringing money
into personal relationships.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.356
But I bought out my contract
at Stahl/Grunner,

07:19.439 --> 07:23.277
and there's only one investor that
I'd really wanna build my business with.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.488
Of course, you don't have to
give me an answer right now.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.366
And if you decide it's not for you,
then I understand that as well.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.702
No, wait. You wanna be partners with me?

07:31.785 --> 07:32.995
Like a team?

07:33.662 --> 07:35.497
Yes. I mean, yes!

07:36.748 --> 07:40.335
I don't know what to say.
I mean, I want to. I really do.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.588
I just-- I have one condition.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.381
Okay. Yeah?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.924
Everything's on the table?

07:46.008 --> 07:49.469
Not sex! I-- Not sex. I didn't--
That's not what I mean. I don't mean that.

07:49.553 --> 07:53.265
What I mean is, no more secrets?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.519
What secrets?

07:58.896 --> 08:01.315
Those ones. The ones behind your smile.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.233
Because I think that whatever they are,

08:03.317 --> 08:06.361
that's what's holding you back
from really flying.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.448
I mean, like, so high. So--

08:09.531 --> 08:10.699
Hi, excuse me. Sorry.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.493
Can I just get another Arnold Palmer?
Just whenever you get a chance.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.661
-Of course.
-Thank you.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.997
Sorry. I couldn't get that guy's attention
for the life of me.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.503
No more secrets. You have my word.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.509
We're gonna be partners!

08:28.592 --> 08:31.386
I mean, we are, like,
legally bound partners.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.304
I'm gonna have Ernie's guy
draw up a contract,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.015
and we can talk specific numbers.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.518
-Oh, my God, I feel so official.
-Yes. Yes. We are official.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.936
-We're official.
-We are official.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.105
Okay, so, what's our first official move?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.649
What are we gonna sell
besides the workout?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.400
Workout equipment.
Is that still on the table?

08:45.484 --> 08:48.237
What about clothing? Shoes?
I love those high-top sneakers.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.865
And you're sure?

08:51.949 --> 08:54.409
In medicine,
there's no being absolutely sure.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.744
Okay, but…

08:55.827 --> 08:57.913
But the procedure went about
as well as it could.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.748
The baby's lung function is very good.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.417
I'm as sure as I can be
that you're out of the woods.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.420
You should all be going home soon.
Where you belong.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.840
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.008
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.853
I'd like to call her Grace.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.647
That's beautiful. Yes.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.399
Let's call her that.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.444
What you've been through…

09:29.528 --> 09:31.238
It's okay, sweetheart.

09:31.738 --> 09:35.075
You've been through so much too,
but we're through it.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.119
Oh, God. We're through it.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.165
I'm terrible.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.257
-I'm a terrible man.
-Stop it. You are not.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.219
God is punishing you for
all the terrible things that I've done.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.222
God isn't punishing me, John.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.643
Yes, he is. He is.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.854
What's gotten into you?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.148
I promised him if he made this stop,

10:06.231 --> 10:09.151
I would never do any of those terrible
things again, and I won't.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.486
I won't do any of it. Ever again.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.532
Well, that's good. Okay?
That's enough now.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.700
I've been unfaithful.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.542
I've been unfaithful
more times than I can even count.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.961
That's not true.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.051
I've been unfaithful 19 times.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.473
Nineteen different women?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.308
Just-- No, just one woman.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.978
Do you love her?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.480
What? No.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.399
I hate her! She's as terrible as me!

10:50.025 --> 10:51.401
I have to tell you everything.

10:51.485 --> 10:55.447
I have to confess my sins.
All the many ways I've disobeyed our God.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.660
I measured my penis…

11:02.079 --> 11:04.039
with Timothy's school ruler.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.500
There were no other rulers in the house.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.587
When I was a kid,
I would get in the shower,

11:10.671 --> 11:14.633
and I would put my finger in my rear end
just to see what it felt like.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.179
I've tasted alcohol. It's fine.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.475
More and more, I'm not sure
I wanna be in the church anymore.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.645
Stop it! Stop it!

11:27.145 --> 11:29.565
You must get yourself together
this instant.

11:31.817 --> 11:35.529
It's fine, okay? It's fine. It's all fine.

11:35.612 --> 11:40.325
But I never, and I mean never,
want to see you act like this again.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.452
Stand up.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.746
Stand up!

11:47.875 --> 11:51.670
You are the man of our house.
Not whoever this is.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.756
You pull yourself together,
and you act like it.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.134
Okay.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.893
Where to, boss?
What's next? What's the plan?

12:05.976 --> 12:08.228
What do you wanna sell?
Have you figured out anything?

12:08.312 --> 12:10.272
You set yourself free, but for what?
To go where?

12:10.355 --> 12:13.400
You don't have a plan.
That whiteboard full of pipe dreams?

12:13.483 --> 12:15.319
Who the fuck do you think you are?

12:15.402 --> 12:18.447
You better figure it out before
Danny ships you off to the funny farm.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.233
Babe, are you okay?

12:55.651 --> 12:59.029
Should you be doing this? Is this healthy?
I mean, you're still recovering.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.491
How do you not fucking get it?
This gets me healthy!

13:03.075 --> 13:07.162
You always think you know,
but you never see. This saved me.

13:08.038 --> 13:13.001
Not you, not college, not sex, not Maya,
not another fucking baby.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.045
This.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.132
So get with the program,
or just get out of the fucking way.

13:39.319 --> 13:43.115
Four, five, six. Five, six, seven.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.450
To the left. Two, three, four.

13:45.534 --> 13:49.246
Knee. Knee. Back to the right.
Two, three, four.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.083
Knee. Knee. To the left. Two, three, four.

13:53.166 --> 13:58.172
Knee. Knee up, two, three, four.
Knee. Knee.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.300
Now kick for eight. Give it up for seven.

14:01.967 --> 14:05.429
Not tired for six. Break free for five.

14:05.512 --> 14:10.642
Unleash for four. And three, two, one.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.898
Now squats, squats, squats.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.451
Where did that come from?

14:29.203 --> 14:32.664
I guess I just finally feel ready.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.417
Yeah, everything was so murky before,

14:35.501 --> 14:39.963
and now I'm stepping into a position
where I can kick some ass.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.215
I finally feel ready.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.887
Sheila's so lucky.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.806
What a gift that she gets
to partner with someone

14:49.890 --> 14:53.101
who makes everyone around them better.

14:55.354 --> 14:58.524
It's not a gift, Ern. It's an investment.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.071
Next year, I'm gonna buy us
a vacation home in Acapulco.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.366
And I didn't make it weird.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.284
Well…

15:13.705 --> 15:15.499
That felt… good.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.543
Really good.

15:17.626 --> 15:22.381
I didn't quite get it before,
but that wakes you right up.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.216
Right?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.262
When it's needed, it's just-- it's needed.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.478
You've been seeing someone.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.940
What? No, I--

15:40.023 --> 15:43.235
I miss a lot of things. Too many things.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.904
Been so myopic, but I do see you, Sheila.

15:45.988 --> 15:50.576
And those phone calls.
That wasn't the cable company, that time.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.918
No, it wasn't.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.429
I mean, I've had my share of--

16:11.889 --> 16:15.601
Well, I can't really
be a hypocrite right now, can I?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.480
But I do think if it's gonna continue,

16:20.564 --> 16:22.816
we should have a talk
about what that means.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.151
It's not.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.237
It's over.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.075
All right.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.168
I do love you.

16:43.629 --> 16:45.422
You know that I love you.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.968
I love all of you.
I'm bad at it, but I do.

16:51.803 --> 16:55.807
I'm so proud of you.
I mean, you really have something here.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.062
Also, you look fucking bonkers in spandex,

17:00.854 --> 17:02.439
if I can say that.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.693
I just want you to be okay.

17:16.286 --> 17:21.666
I'm having a hard time
figuring out what's next for me.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.880
Well, maybe I can help. Like I used to.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.678
Oh, please,
can't I just enjoy getting stoned?

17:32.761 --> 17:34.721
Yes, we are. I'm just, you know--

17:34.805 --> 17:37.975
Let's do this. Let's get up.
Let's move around.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.103
Let's feel the blood flowing
and just let the ideas go.

17:41.186 --> 17:44.398
Don't even think about it.
What do you love about aerobics?

17:44.481 --> 17:47.234
-Okay, I--
-You're already thinking too much.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.069
-No, I think-- Well--
-Come on.

17:49.152 --> 17:54.408
Okay. Well, you know
when you don't know that anything's wrong

17:54.491 --> 17:56.827
because you're so used
to everything feeling so bad

17:56.910 --> 18:01.957
that you've kind of forgotten
what it feels like to feel good anymore?

18:02.040 --> 18:04.501
So when I found aerobics, it was like--
I was like…

18:05.002 --> 18:06.545
All the colors came rushing back,

18:06.628 --> 18:09.715
and I could feel everything again
instead of everything just feeling me.

18:09.798 --> 18:13.093
You know, like… Just--
Does that make any sense?

18:13.177 --> 18:17.222
That makes a lot of sense.
You felt control…

18:17.306 --> 18:18.473
Yeah.

18:18.557 --> 18:21.018
-…strong, capable, like you.
-Yes. Yeah!

18:21.101 --> 18:22.936
-Like myself. Like myself.
-Yeah.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.898
Like how I wanna feel.
Like what I wanna be.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.485
-I don't think it's Body By Sheila.
-No.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.613
-No. I think that's too limiting.
-Yeah.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.157
Because we're talking about
the whole self.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.783
-Yes!
-It's not just the body.

18:36.867 --> 18:40.120
No, and that's what I want
everyone to discover too.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.831
-"Discover." That's a great word. Yes.
-Yes. Okay, yes.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.666
-Discover…
-Yes!

18:44.750 --> 18:45.959
Discover themselves.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.086
No, but Rediscover Yourself.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.588
Yes!

18:49.671 --> 18:53.050
Rediscover Yourself with Sheila.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.593
Yes!

18:55.719 --> 18:58.013
-Yes.
-Oh, my God.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.224
-Yes. "Rediscover," yes!
-Okay.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.851
-I gotta write this down.
-Yes. Okay.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.187
-All right, so--
-Rediscover Yourself with Sheila.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.356
-So, what are some of the tools, right?
-Yes.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.442
'Cause it can't just be the tape.
It's gotta be more than that. So what--

19:10.526 --> 19:12.277
-A journal.
-A journal. That's good. Okay.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.279
You can track how you feel when you start…

19:14.363 --> 19:16.365
-"Track."
-…and you track as you progress.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.576
Tracking with--
Get on track with the tracker, hey?

19:19.660 --> 19:21.411
-Tracker! You have a tracker.
-Yeah.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.747
If you're tracking how you feel,
you won't forget.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.541
If you don't forget, you'll remember.

19:25.624 --> 19:30.295
-Then, you'll--
-Rediscover yourself with Sheila.

19:30.379 --> 19:31.588
-Oh, my God.
-Yes!

19:31.672 --> 19:33.423
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:34.049 --> 19:38.011
-Yes.
-Wow.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.515
I'm glad you're not under the thumb
of Stahl/Grunner anymore.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.309
That's such a huge deal.
You shouldn't be under their thumb.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.562
-No thumbs!
-You shouldn't be under anybody's thumb.

19:46.645 --> 19:47.646
Like a cat.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.737
Whose thumb does Cat Girl live under?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.698
That's impossible. Yeah.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.200
Here she goes.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.494
She's getting into the couch.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.955
Uh-oh, no pillows.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.207
No, get these outta here.

20:10.919 --> 20:11.920
All right.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.138
Can I tell you something?

20:22.890 --> 20:25.517
I think it's great
that you're not under this contract now,

20:25.601 --> 20:28.353
but I don't think
you should jump right in with Greta.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.397
This is your thing.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.818
You're creating it, and I think
you should just take what's yours.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.156
-Okay, yeah. I mean--
-It's you.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.574
Sure, but how?

20:41.867 --> 20:42.868
How?

20:43.911 --> 20:45.495
Maya. Her college fund.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.832
-We can't do that.
-Why not?

20:48.916 --> 20:50.834
-Because--
-It's an investment.

20:51.585 --> 20:55.839
It's an investment in yourself.
It's an investment in you.

20:55.923 --> 21:00.302
And you are a sure thing.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.641
Oh, baby…

21:10.646 --> 21:11.647
Greta!

21:12.439 --> 21:13.690
Howdy, partner.

21:14.483 --> 21:15.567
-Hi.
-Hey.

21:15.651 --> 21:16.902
Thanks for meeting me here.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.947
Of course.
I love a walking meeting. Keeps me sharp.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.574
So, I have some numbers
I wanna run by you.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.034
I think you'll be very happy.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.995
-Yes, that's what I wanted to talk about.
-Okay.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.040
So, the thing is, I was thinking--

21:30.123 --> 21:34.294
Well, Danny and I
had a great conversation last night

21:34.378 --> 21:38.715
about the business and you coming on board
and next steps of, like, what--

21:38.799 --> 21:40.968
You and Danny were talking
about you and me?

21:41.051 --> 21:43.011
Yes! Well, not just you.

21:43.095 --> 21:47.182
It was more of a macro conversation
about the future and the business--

21:47.266 --> 21:49.101
Since when does he care about any of that?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.978
Let's face it.
When it comes to your future,

21:51.061 --> 21:53.564
Danny's always been
a little more micro than macro, right?

21:53.647 --> 21:55.858
You know what?
He really does care.

21:56.692 --> 21:57.860
He does! Greta, he does.

21:57.943 --> 22:01.530
So much so
that he's going to invest in the business.

22:01.613 --> 22:05.075
We are as a couple. Isn't that exciting?

22:05.158 --> 22:07.619
Exciting for who? For me? Or Danny?

22:07.703 --> 22:09.288
For all three of us, really.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.415
I mean,
it means more capital to work with.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.625
He has great ideas
for next steps and branding--

22:13.709 --> 22:17.129
You're messing with me, right?
Are we talking about the same Danny Rubin?

22:17.212 --> 22:19.464
Why would you listen to anything he says?

22:20.549 --> 22:22.593
Because he's still my husband.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.138
Okay.

22:27.639 --> 22:31.143
Wha-- Well, don't say it like that.
Yesterday, you were so excited.

22:31.226 --> 22:35.439
Yesterday, it was you and me.
That's what I was excited about.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.650
And now, all of a sudden,
it's you and Danny. And me.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.903
But Danny's involvement
doesn't lessen your involvement.

22:40.986 --> 22:42.738
-He's an added contribution--
-How can you say that?

22:42.821 --> 22:45.157
How do you not see it? He's no good.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.242
You're being a little unreasonable, Greta.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.995
You see it sometimes,
and other times you are so blind to it.

22:50.078 --> 22:55.042
He has hurt you emotionally and butt-wise.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.127
And he cheated on you with a girl that--

22:57.211 --> 22:58.629
-I cheated on him too.
-When?

22:58.712 --> 23:01.673
With-- Wait, what?
You didn't tell me that.

23:01.757 --> 23:04.009
Well, I told Danny, and he accepts me.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.969
He's not nearly as judgmental as you are,

23:06.053 --> 23:09.348
which is probably why
I haven't told you until now.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.893
You seem so brave sometimes,
like someone I can really look up to.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.811
And other times, you're, like, such a…

23:16.021 --> 23:17.231
A what?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.441
Coward.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.278
I'm not a coward.

23:23.362 --> 23:24.571
You said no more secrets.

23:24.655 --> 23:27.199
You're like a fucking child sometimes.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.409
Like I have to tell you everything,
or we can't be friends?

23:29.493 --> 23:30.786
You want secrets?

23:31.537 --> 23:35.457
I'm bulimic. I eat and throw up.
I have for 20 years, off and on.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.585
So, you're selling a lie?

23:38.669 --> 23:41.338
No. Aerobics saved my life.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.298
That's not the reason you look like that.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.050
But that's not what aerobics is for.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.845
For women like me, it is.
That's part of it, anyways. Most of it.

23:47.928 --> 23:49.930
And all along, you were cheating?

23:50.013 --> 23:52.891
I was hating myself,
if that's any consolation.

23:52.975 --> 23:55.018
It's not! We all hate ourselves.

23:55.102 --> 23:57.813
Jesus Christ, Sheila.
What the hell do you expect me to say?

23:57.896 --> 24:00.816
I don't know. But you don't have to be
so angry at me.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.067
How can I not be?

24:02.150 --> 24:04.111
You only come to me
when you need something.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.738
Someone to watch Maya,
or someone to play cheerleader,

24:06.822 --> 24:09.491
someone to give you money,
someone to be fat next to you.

24:09.575 --> 24:12.828
-And I don't even get to know you.
-You ask too much. It's not fair.

24:12.911 --> 24:15.581
-It's friendship!
-No, that's what you demand of it.

24:15.664 --> 24:18.834
And that hot tub shit. I mean, come on.
That was too much.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.127
You're too much.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.755
You think you're so open now,
but yet, you can't even handle my secrets.

24:23.839 --> 24:26.466
-You can't handle me.
-You want me to be obsessed with you.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.552
That's what makes you feel good.
You and I know it.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.137
So, if anyone is too much, it's you.

24:36.143 --> 24:37.477
But I hope you find somebody.

24:37.561 --> 24:40.606
Whether it's Danny or whoever,
I hope you find somebody.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.566
And I hope they get you help.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.484
And that's it.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.209
Hello?

25:00.292 --> 25:02.836
Hello, ma'am.
I'm calling from the cable company.

25:17.768 --> 25:18.894
Hi.

25:18.977 --> 25:19.978
Hi.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.405
I know you must be surprised, dear.

25:31.990 --> 25:37.496
I certainly was
when I first heard about all this.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.210
Sit down. Please.

25:44.169 --> 25:45.462
Yes, please do.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.131
We won't keep you too long.

25:52.928 --> 25:53.929
John.

25:56.265 --> 26:00.394
Christ teaches us
there's no greater love than forgiveness.

26:01.019 --> 26:03.981
"Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you,

26:04.565 --> 26:07.234
do good to them that hate you,

26:07.317 --> 26:09.903
and pray for them
that despitefully use you

26:10.612 --> 26:11.989
and persecute you."

26:13.073 --> 26:19.079
Sheila, I forgive you
for your grievous sins and indiscretions.

26:20.330 --> 26:23.834
As do I, just as I've forgiven John.

26:31.592 --> 26:36.263
For the sake of your soul,
you must repent with all your heart.

26:36.346 --> 26:39.308
It is the only way to be forgiven
by our Heavenly Father.

26:40.267 --> 26:43.562
And it is the only way
to escape eternal damnation.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.397
Let us come together in prayer.

26:46.565 --> 26:47.691
Join us, Sheila.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.485
We can save you.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.238
I have to save myself.

26:54.156 --> 26:55.157
I'm proud of you.

26:56.533 --> 26:59.745
-And you and Maya, you'll be okay?
-Yeah. We're gonna be fine.

26:59.828 --> 27:03.498
This isn't about us. This is about you,
and I'm really proud that you're going.

27:03.582 --> 27:06.084
It's one of the best facilities
in San Diego.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.337
Well, according to them.

27:10.297 --> 27:14.218
You know, it's just a few days,
and it's right down the road.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.136
Maybe we'll come and visit.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.933
They discourage visitors, so…

27:21.016 --> 27:23.435
Well, then, shit.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.232
It's just a few days. But it's a start.

27:28.774 --> 27:30.150
It's a fresh start.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.152
Okay.

27:36.365 --> 27:37.366
All right.

28:04.393 --> 28:07.563
They don't wanna save you.
They wanna stop you.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.236
You're not falling for it.
You're gonna keep on going.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.780
All the way now. That's it.
