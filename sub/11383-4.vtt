on 12 Monkeys...

the Messengers went.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.833

They need me dead.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.940

Crawford was murdered
in his office.

In the red forest.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.774
We have to go back.
We were there.

00:34.869 --> 00:38.282
The structure of

Yeah, ldid.

be before he tries
to execute me again?

Mr. Ramse,

01:13.199 --> 01:14.439
we need your help.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.611
Well, why didn't
you say so?

01:16.744 --> 01:17.733
What do you
need me to do?

01:18.246 --> 01:20.453
You need me to beg for mercy
while you break my fingers?

01:20.539 --> 01:22.200
That's not what...
How about electrocution?

01:22.541 --> 01:25.123
You could tie
a wire around
my one nut!

01:25.253 --> 01:27.960
Mr. Cole is in jeopardy,

01:29.131 --> 01:31.258
and so is Dr. Railly.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.757
What are you
talking about?

01:34.720 --> 01:35.971
What did you do now?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.929
They're both
stuck in the past.

01:39.558 --> 01:45.269
Their tethers were broken,
and we have no way
of bringing them back.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.606
We need you to
go back to 1944,

01:50.569 --> 01:53.652

bring them home safely.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.654
You trust me now?

01:55.741 --> 01:57.481
I trust your relationship
with Mr. Cole

01:57.618 --> 01:59.483
enough to know that
you will help him.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.237
And you are the only
traveler we have now.

02:04.417 --> 02:08.251

And now,
the Twelve Monkeys
are there as well

02:12.925 --> 02:14.756
and no doubt
have something to do

02:14.844 --> 02:16.800
with the massive
temporal disturbance.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.965
A paradox.

02:21.017 --> 02:25.351
See, I can send you
back before that event.

02:26.355 --> 02:30.098
Mr. Ramse, you can find them,
you can save their lives,

02:30.943 --> 02:33.184
and you can
bring them back home.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.279
And when you do...

02:39.493 --> 02:41.324
When I do?

02:42.038 --> 02:43.869
I will guarantee
your freedom.

You'll be free to walk
out of here with your son.

of us get back here?

03:11.150 --> 03:13.141
Jones is working on that.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.729
You're only sending him back
two days before the paradox.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.734
Is that enough time?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.404
I don't want to give
him the opportunity
to simmer back there.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.988
No telling
what he could do.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.241
Why are you sending him back
ifyou don't trust him?

03:27.041 --> 03:30.329
Because, at the moment,
I'm lacking of
a great many things.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.580
And options are among them.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.661
Right.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.588
So, let me
get this straight.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.924
You want me to place
a classified ad
in the paper?

03:39.595 --> 03:42.052

and we'll find it.

03:42.765 --> 03:47.179
Assuming, of course,
that some aspect of
causality still works.

That's gonna help you
snatch us back home, right?

03:50.606 --> 03:51.937
Yeah.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.102
That's not convincing.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.692
It is a theory at the moment,
but it's a good theory.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.610
Still not convincing.

Some catastrophic
event in 1944

06:06.575 --> 06:09.738
disrupted
the fabric of space-time,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.657
causing temporal anomalies
