WEBVTT

00:17.726 --> 00:20.270
Miss Zott,
please explain how you plan on taking

00:20.270 --> 00:23.190
the X-ray diffraction images outlined
in your proposal

00:23.190 --> 00:27.402
without first drying the protein
into a mineral crystalline form.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.781
Dr. James Bernal
and Dr. Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin

00:30.781 --> 00:32.866
have pioneered a technique
that allows them

00:32.866 --> 00:35.369
to expose pepsin crystals
for X-ray crystallography

00:35.369 --> 00:38.080
within the mother liquor solution
from which they crystallized.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.416
In their crystalline form,
the proteins are largely solvent by volume

00:41.416 --> 00:43.961
within the cellular environment
from which they function.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.712
This allows me the unique opportunity

00:45.712 --> 00:48.382
to image both larger proteins
and nucleic acids.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.179
I'm happy to elaborate.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.741
Thought I'd find you here. Always working.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.869
Hardly. I just keep looking at the clock.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.787
What did they say? Tell me everything.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.957
It's too soon to know for sure, but you
just about knocked their socks off, kid.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.293
Really? I can't believe it.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.920
- Look, like I said, it's not official yet.
- Who are the holdouts?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.338
Meyers. He's old guard.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.008
Did you see his face
when I parried on X-ray crystallography?

01:31.008 --> 01:32.676
He really thought that he had me there.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.928
One of the proudest moments
of my academic career.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.017
Dr. Bates, I--

01:40.642 --> 01:43.270
Oh, God, no. It's okay.
We're the only ones here.

01:45.981 --> 01:46.982
No...

01:47.774 --> 01:51.737
I don't feel that way about you,
Dr. Bates.

01:51.737 --> 01:55.032
Hey, don't play dumb, Elizabeth.
We both know you're anything but dumb.

01:56.742 --> 01:57.910
- I should--
- Hey, hey.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.786
- Not in here. I should--
- Just wait. Hey, just--

01:59.786 --> 02:01.955
Would you hold on? Just stop. Hold on.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.209
- Hold still. Just hold still.
- Stop!

02:05.209 --> 02:06.585
Please!

02:13.217 --> 02:15.928
God! Christ almighty.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.056
You fucking bitch!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.267
You're a very lucky girl.

02:23.393 --> 02:28.065
Dr. Bates has agreed not to file
an aggravated assault charge against you.

02:28.065 --> 02:32.569
However, the department has asked
for a formal statement of regret

02:32.569 --> 02:35.280
to proceed with your PhD candidacy.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.910
They want me to apologize?

02:40.744 --> 02:45.582
Miss Zott,
these types of misunderstandings,

02:45.582 --> 02:47.709
they rarely allow for second chances.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.171
This is an elegant solution
that works for everyone.

02:52.297 --> 02:56.468
Unless, of course, you'd prefer
to discontinue your PhD candidacy.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.222
But I am currently running experiments.
I'm months away from publishing.

03:00.222 --> 03:03.684
You stabbed a tenured professor
with a pencil.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.813
Express regret for your actions,

03:08.564 --> 03:12.109
and we will pretend like none of this
unfortunate business ever happened.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.366
Now that I think about it,
I do have one regret.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.450
Good.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.496
I regret not having more pencils.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.583
I would like to return to my previous
lab position as soon as possible.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.751
Not sure I follow.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.503
I no longer wish
to work with Calvin Evans.

04:54.503 --> 04:55.838
I see. May I ask why?

04:55.838 --> 04:57.214
It's just not working out.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.509
I'm so sorry, I really am,
but sadly my hands are tied.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.386
For Christ's sake, Fran.
What do I have to do?

05:02.386 --> 05:05.222
Is there a form I need to fill out?
A 20-step exit interview?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.516
Whatever meaningless hoops you want me
to jump through, I will do it.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.892
You're a real piece of work.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.353
Not even Dr. Calvin Evans
is good enough for you now?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.188
- Excuse me?
- Since the day you got here,

05:13.188 --> 05:16.066
you have just acted like you are
so much better than the rest of us.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.234
Marching around these halls

05:17.234 --> 05:19.820
with your perfect little nose up
like you invented penicillin.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.905
- Penicillin wasn't invented. It was disc--
- Spare me.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.491
I don't need to be lectured
by somebody so totally clueless.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.034
- What do you mean?
- I told you

05:26.034 --> 05:28.704
that things would get complicated with
Dr. Evans, but you didn't listen to me.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.623
Because I'm a silly,
superficial woman, right?

05:31.623 --> 05:34.877
What could I possibly have to teach
a great lab technician such as yourself?

05:34.877 --> 05:37.546
- I'm a chemist.
- You are a snob is what you are.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.423
You're too good to participate
in Little Miss Hastings,

05:39.423 --> 05:41.175
it doesn't matter how much time and effort

05:41.175 --> 05:42.467
- went into--
- I did participate!

05:42.467 --> 05:44.595
No, you left early.
And you didn't tell anybody.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.513
So,
another lucky girl could've had that spot.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.473
Who could possibly care
about a fake pageant?

05:48.473 --> 05:49.850
I care! It's my job to care.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.935
And I think-- You know,
I think people would agree,

05:51.935 --> 05:53.729
it's a more important job
than opening up your legs

05:53.729 --> 05:56.064
to the most prestigious scientist
in this joint.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.983
That is unequivocally false.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.570
You know, Dr. Evans isn't exactly popular,

06:01.570 --> 06:03.822
but he's a damn good scientist.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.115
And you're neither.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.453
You cannot force me to work with him
out of spite. I'll talk to Dr. Donatti.

06:09.953 --> 06:10.787
Be my guest.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.665
He'll tell you that we already filled
your position in the amino acids lab.

06:13.665 --> 06:17.336
A bright young fellow from Harvard.
On his recommendation, in fact.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.757
You made your bed.
It's not my fault you have to lie in it.

06:49.868 --> 06:50.869
Hi.

06:52.913 --> 06:53.747
Hello.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.416
Can we talk?

06:56.416 --> 06:59.044
Could you please go
to that side of the room? This is my side.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.509
I've created a new spatial system that
will maximize our research productivity

07:05.509 --> 07:07.678
while also respecting
each other's boundaries.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.723
That will be your side of the lab.
This will be my side of the lab.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.185
Obviously,
the room is not perfectly symmetrical,

07:15.185 --> 07:17.396
so I gave myself
11 square centimeters less,

07:17.396 --> 07:20.274
which I think is only fair
considering our body mass differential.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.449
Elizabeth, I don't understand.
What did I do that was so wrong?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.701
It's just clearer this way.

07:36.999 --> 07:40.627
Is it hygiene related?
Because you'll notice no more underwear.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.507
I promise not to eat saltines
in the lab anymore.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.019
Whatever it is,
I'm certain that I can make it right.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.395
Dr. Evans, I'm in the middle of something.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.689
Could we have this conversation
at a later date?

08:01.732 --> 08:02.733
Of course.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.367
Should I--

08:16.705 --> 08:18.165
How about I take off?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.418
Give you the place to yourself.

08:23.795 --> 08:24.796
Very well then.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.877
Don't eat that! You'll make yourself sick.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.549
Wait here. I'll be right back.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.368
Nice to meet you too.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.413
Well, best of luck to you.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.002
Are you ready to extract DNA
from a strawberry?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.089
Here we go.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.510
- That's it?
- Hello.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.678
"That's it?"

11:18.178 --> 11:23.267
You are looking at the instruction manual
for life.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.893
That looks like a booger.

11:24.893 --> 11:25.936
Oh, boy.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.229
Can we watch TV?

11:29.106 --> 11:30.440
Thanks for watching them.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.733
I tried.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.156
And meanwhile,
the California Highway Commission

11:38.156 --> 11:39.950
sent surveyors out despite our petition.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.660
Or maybe because of it.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.330
They were taking measurements
near the church. Can you imagine?

11:46.415 --> 11:47.416
That's awful.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.586
Is there anything I can do?

11:51.503 --> 11:52.838
Yes, actually.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.592
The city council is having
a meeting at the end of the month.

11:56.592 --> 12:00.095
And the Adams-Washington Committee is
presenting our case against the freeway.

12:01.138 --> 12:05.309
If you came, showed your support,
it could make a big difference.

12:05.309 --> 12:09.354
Sure, but I don't have any expertise
in urban development.

12:10.189 --> 12:13.317
You don't need expertise. I've got that.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.614
What I need is someone who looks
like you standing on our side of the room,

12:18.614 --> 12:22.326
backing me up
when I say this is a community issue.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.913
I'll be there. You can count on it.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.540
Thank you.

12:36.089 --> 12:36.924
You okay?

12:41.845 --> 12:42.679
Yeah.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.763
He's not in the building.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.646
Give us the room.

13:42.656 --> 13:47.786
This is the third week in a row I have had
to cancel my tee time to sit in a room,

13:48.412 --> 13:49.496
waiting for a ghost.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.249
- Sir, I was--
- Calvin Evans is a star.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.293
Hastings need stars.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.421
We need the awards and grants
that follow them.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.673
Stars are not disposable.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.259
You are not a star, Robert.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.011
You are a suit.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.138
Suits are disposable.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.893
So let's
skip the pretense of these weekly meetings

14:10.893 --> 14:15.939
in this incredibly depressing room,
and we'll set a deadline.

14:16.565 --> 14:20.110
I'm giving you to February the first
to get Evans in here,

14:20.110 --> 14:23.030
presenting his Remsen submission.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.575
A day later and you are out.

14:29.828 --> 14:33.916
Don't be cross, Robert. I'm a suit too.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.503
It's just that mine is more expensive.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.065
Where's Evans?

14:59.525 --> 15:00.442
I couldn't venture.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.292
He cares for you, doesn't he?

15:18.544 --> 15:20.087
You would have to ask him that.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.048
Layoffs are coming.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.844
If he doesn't secure the Remsen funding
by the top of the year,

15:28.428 --> 15:29.805
I will have to fire people.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.599
Lab techs, for example.

15:33.851 --> 15:37.271
Secretaries. All the female support staff
are gonna have to go first.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.235
The men,
they need to take care of their families.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.697
When you're in my position,

15:48.323 --> 15:50.158
these are the things you have to consider.

15:55.706 --> 15:59.418
Dr. Donatti, is that a threat?

16:01.211 --> 16:03.422
When I fire them,
I will tell them the truth.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.509
That it is the fault of the girl
that distracted Calvin Evans.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.675
Calvin?

16:54.348 --> 16:55.349
Calvin.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.560
Calvin.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.940
- What?
- Donatti came by the lab yesterday.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.858
So what?

17:05.442 --> 17:09.655
He's going to fire people,
if you don't win the Remsen.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.906
More pressure. Perfect.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.492
Perfect.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.329
Do you know what I've done
since I last won the Remsen two years ago?

17:18.329 --> 17:19.330
Do you?

17:21.791 --> 17:22.792
Nothing.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.127
Nothing.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.841
I go into my lab every day, and I shut
the door so that no one will see

17:28.841 --> 17:31.009
that I haven't accomplished a damn thing.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.931
I'm out of ideas.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.143
And then I met you,

17:41.478 --> 17:43.146
and you had so many.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.275
And it was like I could breathe again.

17:48.527 --> 17:49.903
We were building something.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.738
And then you just--

17:53.615 --> 17:57.870
You left me with no explanation.
You just--

17:58.620 --> 18:00.205
I didn't mean to hurt you.

18:02.249 --> 18:06.086
There's just things--
It's hard for me to talk about. I--

18:08.714 --> 18:12.342
I need the door open, 'cause I need
to know that there's a way out.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.682
Okay.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.770
If that's what you need, I can do that.

18:26.607 --> 18:28.025
I miss working with you.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.944
I miss that too.

18:32.821 --> 18:33.822
It's just--

18:36.200 --> 18:40.621
It's hard to trust
that this partnership won't go bad.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.041
It might.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.919
Can't say for certain.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.254
Okay.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.925
See you Monday then.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.429
Elizabeth. What's your dog's name?

18:59.640 --> 19:00.474
Six Thirty.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.978
Excellent name.
After carbon and zinc, I assume?

19:05.562 --> 19:10.359
No. After the time he wakes me up
in the morning. It's like clockwork.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.818
May I ask you another question?

19:12.569 --> 19:15.614
Asking to ask is inefficient,
moving forward, but yes.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.077
Would you like to learn how to row?

19:20.077 --> 19:21.954
On that? No. No, thank you.

19:21.954 --> 19:25.541
No. No, I just meant on the water.

19:25.541 --> 19:29.294
It's calming, picturesque.
And talk about efficiency.

19:29.294 --> 19:34.967
There is nothing more perfectly measured,
more entirely scientific than rowing.

19:35.801 --> 19:38.262
Even the slightest head tilt
will offset the boat.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.889
I would be hard-pressed

19:40.889 --> 19:43.308
to find someone better suited
for the sport than you.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.313
And could be good for teamwork.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.986
Remember to take a breath
and relax. You know?

19:54.945 --> 19:57.781
Just be patient up the slide, okay?

19:57.781 --> 19:58.866
- You're rushing.
- Rushing?

19:58.866 --> 20:00.492
What? You just said I was too slow.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.452
- Get outta your head.
- That's impossible.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.037
Let the oars just sink in.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.623
- You're doing great, all right?
- Calvin Evans, I am absolutely

20:06.623 --> 20:08.959
- and completely hopeless--
- Hey, no, no!

20:13.839 --> 20:16.675
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

20:18.302 --> 20:22.055
<i>"It's calming," he said.
"It's picturesque," he said.</i>

20:23.849 --> 20:25.851
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't know how to swim?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.437
You said we would be in a boat.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.440
A boat negates the need for swimming,
as I previously understood the word.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.483
Ideally, yes.

20:37.946 --> 20:41.742
Thank you for not letting me die.

20:42.993 --> 20:46.997
- You mean gallantly saving your life?
- Please. Do not take it that far.

20:52.920 --> 20:56.131
It is picturesque. I'll give you that.

21:02.346 --> 21:05.474
Elizabeth,
I think this is gonna be a problem.

21:07.184 --> 21:09.478
And I'm not sure there's a solution.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.942
I'm developing feelings for you.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.569
Deep feelings.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.656
And it's not fair to you as a scientist.

21:20.656 --> 21:24.868
You deserve to be treated
with professionalism and respect.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.330
So maybe you were right.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.542
Maybe it is best if we work separately.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.087
That way, I won't be exposed to
your pheromones and--

21:47.307 --> 21:48.308
Correct.

21:50.811 --> 21:51.854
What now?

21:52.980 --> 21:53.981
We carry on.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.985
But we'll be doing that again,
right? The kissing?

21:57.985 --> 22:01.071
Yeah. There is always that risk.

22:03.866 --> 22:04.908
And as you can see,

22:04.908 --> 22:07.619
our proposed route is
the most economically efficient one

22:07.619 --> 22:11.206
and will also enliven
several blighted communities in its path.

22:11.206 --> 22:15.836
We are confident that this freeway will be
a shining example of urban geography.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.672
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

22:18.672 --> 22:25.012
Next, we will hear from a representative
of the Adams-Washington Committee.

22:26.263 --> 22:28.932
Good afternoon. I'm Harriet Sloane,

22:28.932 --> 22:32.519
legal aid in the office of Eugene Hollis,
proud Sugar Hill resident

22:32.519 --> 22:34.813
and founding member of this committee.

22:36.690 --> 22:42.696
In your proposal defense,
you used the word "blighted" nine times

22:42.696 --> 22:44.323
to refer to the Sugar Hill neighborhood.

22:46.241 --> 22:49.494
I'm not sure I know
the meaning of that word.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.956
Grim, dreary, inhospitable.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.125
Do you need me
to define any of those words?

22:55.125 --> 22:57.377
Thank you. I do not.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.590
I only ask because, well, I'm confused.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.134
I have two children, Linda and Junior,

23:04.134 --> 23:06.762
who love to sell lemonade
in Berkeley Square.

23:06.762 --> 23:09.806
Duke Ellington
and his good friend Hattie McDaniel

23:09.806 --> 23:12.184
host salons in their mansions.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.812
My husband, who is currently serving
our country in Korea,

23:15.812 --> 23:17.940
is the first Black chief of surgery.

23:17.940 --> 23:21.235
One of my neighbors is in line
for a Nobel in Chemistry.

23:21.735 --> 23:25.113
So, when you say "blighted,"

23:27.074 --> 23:28.116
I don't understand.

23:29.493 --> 23:33.205
When you seek to put your freeway through
our predominantly Black neighborhood

23:33.205 --> 23:36.166
and two other Black neighborhoods
miles away,

23:36.166 --> 23:39.711
solely on the basis
that they are "blighted",

23:41.171 --> 23:44.550
my only recourse is to question
the definition of the word.

23:56.353 --> 24:00.649
So, I've tried adding PRPP
and ATP at various concentrations,

24:00.649 --> 24:02.067
but the result is always the same.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.487
Maybe the solution is too acidic?

24:06.905 --> 24:08.198
Too basic?

24:08.198 --> 24:09.616
I am genuinely offended.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.326
What do you think I am,
some kind of dimwit?

24:11.326 --> 24:12.870
No, definitely not.

24:16.331 --> 24:17.791
We should take a break.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.543
Take a break?
We haven't even been productive.

24:19.543 --> 24:21.086
That's why we should take a break.

24:21.086 --> 24:24.882
Elizabeth, you are smarter than me,

24:24.882 --> 24:26.925
but there's one thing I have
that you don't.

24:27.718 --> 24:28.719
A Y chromosome?

24:29.428 --> 24:32.264
Yes. But also, I have a jazz mindset.

24:32.264 --> 24:36.310
I know when to sit back,
go easy, let the ideas...

24:36.310 --> 24:39.062
- Meander.
- ...carry me where they may.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.858
Directionless with no goal?

24:43.775 --> 24:45.485
Towards the supreme goal.

24:46.945 --> 24:47.946
Which is?

24:50.824 --> 24:51.825
The good stuff.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.788
Come on, let's get outta here.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.790
I want to take you somewhere
more important.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.382
You're okay. I'm right here.

25:11.428 --> 25:15.849
I think that the issue is that
my body's residual diving reflex

25:15.849 --> 25:19.269
is being overridden
by my fear-paralysis reflex,

25:19.269 --> 25:23.774
so I just need to find a way
to circumvent that reflex.

25:25.651 --> 25:26.652
Could be.

25:27.903 --> 25:30.113
I think you need to learn to blow bubbles.

25:40.624 --> 25:41.875
<i>Let's try this.</i>

25:42.459 --> 25:46.338
Keep your hands on the wall,
put your face in

25:47.589 --> 25:48.799
and s-- and blow bubbles.

25:48.799 --> 25:51.802
You don't even have to put your
whole head in. Just your face, like this.

25:59.393 --> 26:00.602
You got it.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.772
This is silly that I'm so nervous.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.440
I'm right here.

26:12.698 --> 26:13.991
I changed my mind.

26:14.658 --> 26:15.951
Well, okay.

26:18.704 --> 26:19.746
What if we were to kiss?

26:19.746 --> 26:21.248
How would that be helpful?

26:21.248 --> 26:24.001
If I were to occupy your mouth
as we go under, I think--

26:24.001 --> 26:27.880
I think it could work.
You just have to trust me.

26:28.630 --> 26:29.923
- Do it.
- Are you sure?

26:29.923 --> 26:31.675
Yes, do it before I can think about it.

26:40.893 --> 26:41.894
How was that?

26:42.477 --> 26:44.438
I'm not sure. I think we should try again.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.026
What are you writing?

27:32.444 --> 27:35.948
Just some musings. Not ready to share.

27:35.948 --> 27:37.074
Give me a hint.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.587
You seduced then tricked me.

27:51.630 --> 27:55.300
"Repeated hydrolysis of ATP
after it's already been reduced to ADP"?

27:55.300 --> 27:57.094
It's just something I'm playing with.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.721
The products are AMP,
but I'm stuck. It's impossible.

27:59.721 --> 28:04.393
The hydrolyzed molecules release
an inorganic pyrophosphate.

28:07.813 --> 28:09.857
I'm very attracted to you right now.

28:11.984 --> 28:17.239
With the energy produced from the reaction
and the added phosphorous-containing ion.

28:18.532 --> 28:20.200
This is it, Calvin.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.579
Oh, my God. Come here.

28:28.250 --> 28:32.880
<i>Come, all ye faithful</i>

28:32.880 --> 28:36.884
<i>Joyful and triumphant</i>

28:36.884 --> 28:39.303
<i>O come ye</i>

28:39.303 --> 28:45.475
<i>O come ye to Bethlehem</i>

28:45.976 --> 28:49.313
<i>Come and behold him</i>

28:49.313 --> 28:50.898
Are you going home for Christmas?

28:52.900 --> 28:53.901
What do you mean?

28:55.152 --> 28:57.738
I'm assuming you have family
to celebrate the holidays with?

28:59.281 --> 29:01.658
No. What about you?

29:03.452 --> 29:05.454
I don't really feel
like celebrating this year.

29:06.330 --> 29:08.248
All I want for Christmas is
to keep working.

29:10.209 --> 29:11.668
That's strange, Elizabeth.

29:12.628 --> 29:13.629
Why?

29:14.129 --> 29:15.380
I feel the exact same way.

29:20.177 --> 29:21.178
What about you?

30:26.702 --> 30:29.705
Calvin, turn the music off.

30:37.629 --> 30:40.007
Do it again. Wow.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.593
- Wow
- Did we do it?

30:43.927 --> 30:45.512
- Oh, man alive.
- We did it.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.103
We should celebrate.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.188
We must celebrate.

30:55.981 --> 30:57.024
Come with me.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.277
Number eight, you little devil.

32:13.642 --> 32:14.977
This is how you dance.

32:31.326 --> 32:34.162
I think this is the first time
I haven't hated Christmas.

32:35.497 --> 32:36.915
Not big on holidays?

32:37.916 --> 32:41.295
Just reminds me of things that
I don't want to be reminded of.

32:42.629 --> 32:43.630
Me too.

32:44.214 --> 32:46.550
Like what kinds of things?

32:48.051 --> 32:49.803
All my relatives are dead.

32:49.803 --> 32:53.473
I'm alone in the world.
Your usual festive holiday fare.

32:53.974 --> 32:54.975
I'm sorry.

32:57.978 --> 32:58.979
What about you?

33:00.105 --> 33:05.027
My family?
I lost my brother when we were young.

33:07.863 --> 33:08.780
And your parents?

33:10.282 --> 33:14.536
I haven't spoken to them since I was 17.
It's my choice.

33:17.497 --> 33:21.168
- Really festive holiday fare.
- Really.

33:21.168 --> 33:23.837
We are quite bad at celebrating Christmas.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.173
Christmas is a fiction.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.717
Right. Christmas is a fiction.

33:28.717 --> 33:29.927
I forgot about that.

33:30.886 --> 33:32.888
Guess that means
presents are off the table.

33:33.722 --> 33:35.724
But I didn't say that.

33:35.724 --> 33:38.727
I didn't mean to-- It depends.
What did you get me?

33:40.646 --> 33:42.689
Meet me in the cafeteria
in two and a half hours.

33:44.525 --> 33:45.817
Okay.

33:45.817 --> 33:50.489
I did have some A5P
I wanted to purify before next week, so...

33:52.699 --> 33:54.701
Perfect. Okay.

33:57.496 --> 33:58.789
Two and a half hours.

34:54.094 --> 34:55.094
You cooked for me?

34:55.888 --> 34:57.639
I can't promise it'll taste
as good as yours.

34:57.639 --> 35:02.644
But, you know, I did a practice run,
and it was edible.

35:08.483 --> 35:10.194
The open flame is a safety hazard.

35:10.986 --> 35:13.405
Well, just wait till you try the chicken.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.244
This is odd. I'm--

35:20.120 --> 35:20.954
Yes.

35:20.954 --> 35:22.539
Too far? Yeah.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.643
You know, it's not-- I mean--

35:42.643 --> 35:44.311
It's good. Well done.

35:44.811 --> 35:45.812
Well done?

35:48.565 --> 35:49.983
Not well done. It's well-done.

35:50.734 --> 35:51.735
It's good.

35:56.198 --> 35:57.074
Your gift.

36:10.212 --> 36:12.047
I thought Six Thirty
could be your running buddy.

36:13.048 --> 36:14.925
Because I sure as hell
will not be doing that with you.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.055
It's perfect.

36:24.268 --> 36:25.435
I have one last thing.

36:27.980 --> 36:29.565
It's small, but...

36:33.902 --> 36:35.779
I think you should move in with me.

36:36.488 --> 36:38.824
And maybe you'll say it's too fast.

36:38.824 --> 36:43.370
But we spend all our time together anyway,
and I have so much space for one person.

36:43.370 --> 36:46.790
It's just illogical for us
to keep going back and forth

36:46.790 --> 36:47.833
and back and forth and--

36:47.833 --> 36:50.919
Not to mention just very disorienting
for Six Thirty.

36:52.546 --> 36:56.300
Yes.
Extremely disorienting for Six Thirty.

36:56.967 --> 37:00.971
I'll have to contribute to rent.

37:00.971 --> 37:03.724
I own the house. It's paid in full.

37:03.724 --> 37:06.810
Oh, no, no. I'll chip in, in some way.

37:12.316 --> 37:15.110
Dinner, four nights a week.

37:17.821 --> 37:19.156
Three dinners and a lunch.

37:21.867 --> 37:22.868
Deal.

37:24.369 --> 37:25.495
Okay. Let me try this.

37:35.756 --> 37:37.841
I think it's still missing something.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.386
Yes, it is missing quite a few things.

37:42.387 --> 37:43.764
But it is an excellent start.

37:43.764 --> 37:44.848
Thank you.

37:52.856 --> 37:56.652
All right, go ahead. What's it missing?

37:58.362 --> 38:00.030
Do you have your notepad and pencil?

38:03.575 --> 38:07.913
Harriet. Sorry,
he's still getting used to his leash.

38:07.913 --> 38:10.290
I've been trying to catch you.
I have some exciting news.

38:14.336 --> 38:20.008
Oh, shit. The meeting. I'm so sorry.
It's just this research with Elizabeth.

38:20.008 --> 38:23.637
And you know, I-- We actually
have a presentation in a few hours.

38:23.637 --> 38:26.348
Don't worry about it.
Looks like you got your hands full.

38:27.307 --> 38:28.225
How'd it go?

38:28.225 --> 38:29.893
How do you think it went?

38:31.103 --> 38:34.565
- Here, let me help you with that.
- I've got it. Thank you.

38:36.275 --> 38:37.776
Good luck with your presentation.

39:03.927 --> 39:06.930
So, building on the work of Pauling,

39:06.930 --> 39:11.018
my hypothesis supports the notion-- Sorry.

39:11.018 --> 39:12.269
My hypothesis,

39:12.269 --> 39:18.358
supported by the notion that
proteins are composed of amino acids--

39:18.358 --> 39:21.195
I'm sorry, chains--
are composed by chains,

39:21.195 --> 39:23.530
entire chains of amino acids.

39:25.449 --> 39:26.700
It's quite exhilarating.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.035
You ready?

40:11.328 --> 40:12.704
It's a long time coming.

40:26.677 --> 40:27.803
Good afternoon.

40:29.513 --> 40:33.267
Dr. Evans, we've heard a lot of
thoroughly researched submissions today.

40:33.267 --> 40:37.729
So, we're all very excited to hear what's
kept you behind closed doors for so long.

40:37.729 --> 40:38.981
Thank you, Dr. Donatti.

40:38.981 --> 40:42.818
But, as first author,
Elizabeth will be presenting today.

40:48.657 --> 40:52.703
Dr. Evans and I have been investigating
de novo nucleotide synthesis

40:52.703 --> 40:56.999
as a way of better understanding early
biochemical evolution and abiogenesis.

40:57.583 --> 40:58.959
Unlike the aminos study group,

40:58.959 --> 41:01.461
we are starting with
the basic assumption that DNA,

41:01.461 --> 41:04.006
not protein,
is the basic foundation of life.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.718
After successfully isolating PRPP,

41:07.718 --> 41:10.345
we've used it
to synthesize uridine monophosphate

41:10.345 --> 41:13.765
and inosine monophosphate for pyrimidines
and purines, respectively.

41:13.765 --> 41:18.520
I'm sorry, are you saying that
you can create nucleotides from scratch?

41:19.104 --> 41:21.106
That is exactly what
I'm saying, Dr. Price.

41:21.106 --> 41:23.817
Even if you have managed
to synthesize nucleotides,

41:23.817 --> 41:28.238
we here at Hastings believe that DNA will
eventually prove to be a dead end.

41:29.072 --> 41:31.450
This protocol that you
and Dr. Evans have come up with

41:31.450 --> 41:33.035
is likely nothing more than a party trick.

41:33.035 --> 41:37.372
Whether you believe that proteins
or DNA are the foundations of life,

41:37.372 --> 41:40.751
this synthesis pathway is novel.

41:40.751 --> 41:43.420
Diels and Alder won the Nobel Prize
for diene synthesis.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.505
Miss Zott.

41:44.505 --> 41:47.216
Miss? Isn't she a doctor?

41:47.216 --> 41:48.258
She's a lab tech.

41:48.258 --> 41:51.220
It is her research that is
the basis for this proposal.

41:51.220 --> 41:54.556
Dr. Evans,
this institution has a reputation.

41:54.556 --> 41:59.520
A reputation based on the likes of
world-class scientists like yourself

41:59.520 --> 42:01.021
doing world-class work.

42:01.897 --> 42:04.816
Not the specious theories of
a pretty lab tech

42:04.816 --> 42:07.986
who's been distracting him from real work.

42:07.986 --> 42:10.072
This work is revelatory, sir.

42:10.948 --> 42:15.953
Sir, a lab technician taking first billing
over a chemist?

42:16.620 --> 42:20.207
Hastings would be the laughingstock of
the entire scientific community.

42:20.207 --> 42:21.708
I'd rather shutter the place.

42:22.876 --> 42:27.005
Do you have any other chemists to present
for the Remsen, or are we done here?

42:27.881 --> 42:29.383
We are done here.

42:29.967 --> 42:32.386
- Let's go home.
- We'll take my name off the paper.

42:34.221 --> 42:35.472
No, we won't.

42:41.186 --> 42:42.271
Elizabeth.

42:43.397 --> 42:44.731
- We can't finish our research...
- Elizabeth.

42:44.731 --> 42:47.317
...without the grant, and we can't get
the grant unless we submit.

42:47.317 --> 42:49.570
- The work is too important.
- I was protecting you.

42:49.570 --> 42:52.072
Calvin, I need you to understand this.

42:52.072 --> 42:55.784
If I don't stand on my own two feet,
I'm no one.

42:55.784 --> 42:59.371
And I need you to understand this. You are
what I treasure most in this world.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.415
Not because you are pretty,
not because you are smart,

43:01.415 --> 43:03.250
but because you love me and I love you.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.919
And you can try and deny it,
but I will not believe you.

43:05.919 --> 43:07.004
When certain atoms collide,

43:07.004 --> 43:09.548
it is instantaneous and it is inevitable.

43:09.548 --> 43:10.883
It is basic chemistry.

43:13.969 --> 43:15.053
I don't deny it.

43:19.141 --> 43:20.142
Thank you.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.479
We will submit on our own
without Hastings.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.232
Can you even do that?

43:28.275 --> 43:30.068
I don't know that anyone has ever tried.

44:18.700 --> 44:20.619
I don't feel bad when I'm with you.

44:22.621 --> 44:23.622
Thanks?

44:25.374 --> 44:26.375
No, I just--

44:27.501 --> 44:31.630
I mean,
most of my life I've lived with this

44:33.048 --> 44:37.845
inexplicable panic
in the core of my heart.

44:40.556 --> 44:42.558
When we're together, it goes quiet.

44:46.103 --> 44:50.023
You're like a medicine
that I wanna take forever.

44:58.323 --> 45:01.994
If by "forever" you're talking
about the traditional model,

45:01.994 --> 45:05.622
I'd like to be clear
so there's no confusion.

45:05.622 --> 45:09.209
I don't want to get married,
and I don't want to have children.

45:09.209 --> 45:12.880
Yeah, sure. Not right this instant,
but I mean, eventually.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.006
You'd be incredible--

45:14.006 --> 45:17.843
Calvin,
you could have six or seven children,

45:17.843 --> 45:20.554
and it wouldn't do anything to your life
or to your work.

45:21.638 --> 45:23.223
A woman has to make a choice.

45:24.391 --> 45:28.353
Does she want to have children,
or does she want to do anything else?

45:29.980 --> 45:33.317
I have made my decision,
and I'm not going to change my mind.

45:34.234 --> 45:37.279
And if that puts an end to this,

45:38.488 --> 45:39.531
I understand.

45:50.626 --> 45:52.085
Thank you for telling me.

45:53.086 --> 45:54.254
Now I know.

45:55.422 --> 45:56.423
Know what?

45:58.800 --> 45:59.927
What you need.

46:02.930 --> 46:06.683
As long as I have you and you are happy,
that is enough for me.

46:07.559 --> 46:12.272
It's more than I could have ever imagined.
And it's absolutely...

46:13.774 --> 46:14.608
What?

46:15.692 --> 46:16.860
I don't know. I--

46:19.696 --> 46:24.117
Science has been trying to define
the laws that govern our universe.

46:24.117 --> 46:28.622
The equations that can explain our past
and predict our future.

46:28.622 --> 46:34.962
But I'm starting to wonder if maybe we've
forgotten the most important variable.

46:36.171 --> 46:37.631
Please don't tell me it's God.

46:39.716 --> 46:40.676
Surprise.

46:41.176 --> 46:42.177
Surprise?

46:42.803 --> 46:48.892
What if life is necessarily unpredictable?

46:49.935 --> 46:54.314
Maybe even the very thing that
makes it possible in the first place.

46:55.941 --> 47:00.028
Is that how you explain abiogenesis?
How life began?

47:01.446 --> 47:02.281
Surprise.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.786
- You think the Remsen's gonna go for that?
- All right. Okay. All right.

47:09.037 --> 47:13.333
Hear me out. One of science's greatest
minds and his revolutionary theory:

47:13.834 --> 47:15.752
surprise, we can't predict anything.

47:28.891 --> 47:30.893
All right. We're gonna go on a run.

47:31.602 --> 47:33.770
I need to have a think
on hydrolyzing enzymes.

47:34.354 --> 47:35.522
It's a dead end.

47:37.900 --> 47:38.901
Never know.

47:40.194 --> 47:41.278
We're getting close.

47:42.029 --> 47:43.113
Very close.

47:44.740 --> 47:48.410
Yes, we are going. Good boy.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.380
Hey, come on. Hey, let's go.

48:00.380 --> 48:02.257
Okay, let's go. Okay.

48:06.136 --> 48:07.554
Yeah. Yeah, boy.

48:41.088 --> 48:45.926
Come on. Hey. Hey, Six Thirty, it's okay.
Come here. Come on.

49:03.694 --> 49:05.946
- Okay, okay.
- He's not moving!

49:06.947 --> 49:09.783
- Come here, give me a hand.
- Go get help!
