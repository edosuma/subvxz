-Well, the big spooky pictures

they're real.

how joking about it
might make Jed feel?

and ugly enough
to fight his own fights.

41:10.553 --> 41:12.514
I don't know.

41:12.597 --> 41:14.766
You've gotta help me.
Please help me.

41:14.849 --> 41:16.184
(CRUNCHING)

41:16.267 --> 41:17.811
Jesus, what's that noise?

41:20.438 --> 41:23.316
-Describe where you are.
-I'm in a... I'm in a box.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.235
A wooden box.

41:25.318 --> 41:26.736
It's dark...

41:27.737 --> 41:29.030
I'm scared, Jed.

41:29.114 --> 41:31.032
What the hell
is happening to me?

41:31.116 --> 41:33.743
It's all right.
It's all right, don't panic.
All right? I'm gonna find you.

41:33.827 --> 41:36.287
-Jed...
-Sadie...

41:36.371 --> 41:38.373
-(COUGHS)
-Sadie, I'm losing you.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.840
(CLATTERING AND CLUNKING)

41:49.759 --> 41:52.220
(SOBS) It's no good.

41:59.227 --> 42:00.729
(RINGING TONE)

42:02.105 --> 42:04.315
Hi, it's Sadie.
Please leave a message.

42:12.115 --> 42:13.908
(DISTANT CLATTERING)

42:18.121 --> 42:19.164
Sadie!

42:20.665 --> 42:22.042
(CRIES OUT)

42:24.627 --> 42:25.920
Sadie!

42:26.004 --> 42:27.797
I'm coming! Hold on!

42:30.175 --> 42:31.843
Sadie, stay calm.
I'm here.

42:33.261 --> 42:34.596
(SOBS)

42:38.683 --> 42:40.352
(WHIMPERS)

42:41.853 --> 42:43.605
Somebody call
an ambulance now!

42:43.688 --> 42:45.273
He was alive!

42:46.983 --> 42:48.610
My baby.

42:48.693 --> 42:50.320
He was alive.

42:54.199 --> 42:55.408
(SOBS)

42:55.492 --> 42:56.743
I'm so sorry.

43:08.630 --> 43:12.634
I'm sorry to hear about
Sadie's unfortunate cry
for help.

43:14.552 --> 43:16.012
I hope
she recovers soon.

43:16.805 --> 43:18.223
(DOOR OPENS)

43:19.849 --> 43:22.227
You have got to see
what's happening outside.

43:36.366 --> 43:39.452
Ex-patient.
Used to hang around
the place apparently.
