00:27.820 --> 00:31.051
<i> Fall in line

00:31.120 --> 00:33.490
<i> They don't know

00:53.640 --> 00:56.810

Kids got the beat</i>

01:32.020 --> 01:34.920

02:16.090 --> 02:19.530
Linda, there's that guy
from the stereo store.

02:19.660 --> 02:23.900
- Don't you think
he looks like Richard Gere?
- See his cute little butt?

02:23.970 --> 02:28.340
- You guys, let's talk about
that fox that just walked in.
- We already were.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.840
I'm gonna go over there
and change the shakers.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.400
- Cool out. That's Stacy's section.
- He's too old.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.970
She's not even
in high school yet.

02:36.050 --> 02:37.880
Smoking's upstairs to your left.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.480
Smoking's upstairs to your left.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.080
Smoking's upstairs.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.320
Rat, is Dolly Parton giving you
a percentage of the profit?

02:48.390 --> 02:50.420
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

02:50.490 --> 02:53.760
You the guy with
the Van Halen tickets?

02:53.830 --> 02:55.800
That could be.

02:55.870 --> 02:57.960
How much for something
in the first ten rows?

02:58.040 --> 03:01.030
- Twenty bucks apiece.
- Those tickets were only $12.50.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.010
So don't buy 'em.

03:03.070 --> 03:05.170
All the other scalpers are sold out.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.300
Scalper?
Did you call me a scalper?

03:08.380 --> 03:13.440
Listen, gentlemen, I perform a service
here, and the service costs money.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.780
Do you want the tickets or don't you?

03:15.850 --> 03:17.790
Okay, we'll take 'em.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.690
All right.
What'd I say, $25?

03:20.760 --> 03:22.230
Twenty!

03:23.960 --> 03:27.400
All right.
Thank you.

03:29.730 --> 03:33.530
Just made 16 bucks, Rat.
What's the matter? You look depressed.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.060
I hate working the theater. All the
action's on the other side of the mall.

03:42.110 --> 03:45.510
- How's it going?
- You want to take his table?

03:45.580 --> 03:48.380
Go for it.
He's cute.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.940
Just take his order,
look him in the eye.

03:52.020 --> 03:56.220
If he says anything remotely funny,
laugh like you never heard anything
so funny.

03:56.290 --> 03:58.230
And smile!

04:01.300 --> 04:03.230
Go for it.

04:07.810 --> 04:12.110
So, you working hard or hardly working?

04:12.180 --> 04:15.610
You look like you
could still be in high school.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.269
I know.
Everybody says that.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.940
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.080
- How old are you?
- Twenty-six.

04:23.150 --> 04:26.210
Do you think we could
still be friends?

04:28.090 --> 04:30.460
So what can I get you?

04:30.530 --> 04:33.620
How 'bout a meatball sandwich,

04:33.700 --> 04:37.530
a medium Coke,
and your phone number?

04:49.350 --> 04:51.980
- Hi.
- Hello.

04:52.050 --> 04:55.020
Get outta here, Bradley.

04:55.090 --> 04:57.050
- Dave.
- How you doin', Brad?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.350
Cookin'!

04:59.420 --> 05:01.480
Daddy's home, boys.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.930
I shall serve no fries
before their time.

05:10.530 --> 05:14.730
This one's on you, dude.
Who's got the beaucoup dolares today?

05:14.810 --> 05:17.640
Uno dinero.

05:17.710 --> 05:21.670
- What have you got, Mr. Buck Man?
- I got a cigarette.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.510
I got uno "nickelette."

05:24.580 --> 05:28.520
Hey! You guys had shirts on
when you came in here.

05:29.850 --> 05:32.150
Somethin' happened to 'em, man.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.090
Come on, Spicoli,
just put the shirts back on.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.250
You see that sign?

05:40.930 --> 05:44.630
"No shirts. No shoes. No dice."

05:44.700 --> 05:46.670
Right.

05:46.740 --> 05:50.300
Learn it.
Know it. Live it.

05:51.140 --> 05:53.510
- Whoa.
- He's the full hot orator.

05:55.010 --> 05:58.310
Linda, did I show you this?
He gave me his card.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.510
"Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant."

06:00.580 --> 06:02.950
Maybe we should get a frame for this,
and put it up on the wall.

06:03.020 --> 06:07.550
Linda, you're the one who told me
I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall.

06:07.630 --> 06:10.720
- Do you think he'll call this week?
- Why don't you call him?

06:10.800 --> 06:15.460
- I can't.
- You can. Guys love that sort of thing.

06:15.530 --> 06:17.870
- Really?
- Yes!

06:17.940 --> 06:20.840
Stacy, what are you waiting for?
You're 15 years old.

06:20.910 --> 06:25.340
I did it when I was 13.
It's no huge thing. It's just sex.

06:25.410 --> 06:29.570
- He was hot, wasn't he?
- If I didn't have a fiance
in Chicago, I'd go for it.

06:38.990 --> 06:43.150
Hey, how you doin'?
Welcome to Ridgemont.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.190
Will it look okay?

06:51.940 --> 06:55.770
<i>Well, she was an American girl</i>

06:56.770 --> 06:58.440
<i> Raised on promises</i>

06:59.610 --> 07:04.570
- Do you know where U.S. History is?
- Down the hall and turn left.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.280
<i> Somewhere else</i>

07:09.350 --> 07:13.310
<i> She was an American girl</i>

07:31.940 --> 07:33.070
Hi, Bradley.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.700
Grown up.
Lookin' good.

07:36.980 --> 07:39.750
Another year joined at the lips.

07:39.820 --> 07:43.880
- Hi, Brad!
- Denise. I'd make you see God.

07:43.950 --> 07:44.890
Brad!

07:47.690 --> 07:49.660
- Big Cruising Vessel!
- Bradley!

07:51.760 --> 07:52.730
Thank you.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.330
Six more payments, gentlemen,
and this beautiful...

07:57.400 --> 08:00.930
blue, four-door, luxury sedan
is all mine!

08:01.010 --> 08:04.240
I'll give you
four tickets in the fifth row...

08:04.310 --> 08:07.180
for the low price of $140.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.610
See that car? Some alumni
gave Jefferson that car...

08:10.680 --> 08:12.650
for playing football
when he was a sophomore.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.620
- Helped him pick it out.
- Slick car.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.550
We go way back, you know.

08:20.990 --> 08:26.330
Hey, Charles, how you doin', buddy?
Car looks great. I mean really terrific.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.060
You're really keeping it up
wonderfully.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.930
Don't fuck with it!

08:36.039 --> 08:37.669
Shit!
That's my man.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.210
Brad?

08:44.280 --> 08:47.980
- Arnold! What's happening?
- Can I talk to you a minute?

08:48.050 --> 08:49.990
Sure, man.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.850
I really hate Bronco Burger.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.720
Ever since they started with the chicken
nuggets, everything went downhill.

08:55.790 --> 08:59.700
You have to fry all their greasy food,
and you have to polish things.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.220
And the manager's an asshole.
I was just wondering...

09:04.300 --> 09:07.500
Arnold, do you want to work
at All-American Burger?

09:07.570 --> 09:09.700
Yeah, well, um...

09:09.770 --> 09:12.540
I can probably get you in.
Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.

09:12.610 --> 09:14.410
- All right!
- Okay.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.810
Wait.
Did you hear the bell ring?

09:17.880 --> 09:20.910
- What bell?
- We're here.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.370
Aloha.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.130
My name is Mr. Hand.

09:43.870 --> 09:46.570
I have but one question for you.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.550
Can you attend my class?

09:49.610 --> 09:55.050
It is for your own good. And if you
can't make it, I can make you.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.580
We have a 20-question quiz every Friday.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.590
Your grade is the average
of all your quizzes,

10:01.660 --> 10:04.630
plus the midterm and final
which counts for one-third.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.460
Got it?

10:08.100 --> 10:10.500
Also...

10:11.970 --> 10:16.930
There will be no eating. E-A-T-l-N-G.

10:17.010 --> 10:20.970
No eating in this class!

10:21.050 --> 10:23.610
You get used to doing
your own business on your own time.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.210
That's one demand I make.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.450
Just like you wouldn't want me
to come to your house...

10:29.520 --> 10:32.150
- and discuss U.S. History
on your time, understand?
- Yes, sir.

10:37.490 --> 10:40.490
This guy's been stoned
since the third grade.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.370
- Yes?
- Yeah, I'm registered in this class.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.730
- What class?
- This is U.S. History.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.700
- I see the globe right there.
- Really?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.570
Hey.
May I come in?

10:51.640 --> 10:54.130
Oh, please!

10:54.210 --> 10:57.670
I get so lonely when I hear
that third attendance bell ring...

10:57.750 --> 11:00.840
and all my kids are not here.

11:00.920 --> 11:05.790
Sorry, I'm late. It's just like
this new schedule's totally confusing.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.450
I know that dude!

11:09.530 --> 11:11.860
Mr. Spicoli.

11:11.930 --> 11:15.090
That's the name they gave me.

11:16.730 --> 11:20.730
- You're ripping my card!
- Yes.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.260
Hey, bud, what's your problem?

11:24.340 --> 11:26.310
No problem at all.

11:26.380 --> 11:30.280
I think you know
where the front office is.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.010
You dick!

11:32.080 --> 11:35.520
I have taken the time
to print up a complete schedule...

11:35.590 --> 11:39.150
of class quizzes
and the chapters they cover.

11:39.220 --> 11:42.020
Please pass them
to the desk behind you.

11:42.090 --> 11:43.650
Back, back, back.

11:55.140 --> 11:58.540
Did you hear about this surfer guy
who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand
this morning?

11:58.610 --> 12:01.410
Oh, no!
He just called him a dick.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.310
A dick? Oh, God.
People exaggerate so much here.

12:06.580 --> 12:10.490
Linda, that girl
looks just like Pat Benatar.

12:10.550 --> 12:14.220
I know. Wait.
There are three girls at Ridgemont...

12:14.290 --> 12:16.520
who have cultivated
the Pat Benatar look.

12:16.590 --> 12:18.720
Chanel Semlar,

12:18.800 --> 12:22.660
Mary Ann Zlotnick
in the red tights.

12:22.730 --> 12:24.760
Do you think guys find that
more attractive?

12:24.840 --> 12:28.500
Stacy, please, give me a break!
You are so much prettier!

12:28.570 --> 12:33.010
Yeah, I know, but do you think
they'd be better in bed?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.700
What do you mean?
You either do it or you don't.

12:35.780 --> 12:41.220
No. There are like... variables
that I might not be good at.

12:41.290 --> 12:46.550
- Like what variables?
- Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

12:46.620 --> 12:49.250
What's the big deal?

12:49.330 --> 12:52.890
- I never did it.
- You've never given a blow job?

12:52.960 --> 12:57.460
Never? Stace, there's nothing to it.
It's so easy.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.600
Check it out.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.770
Relax your throat muscles.

13:09.780 --> 13:12.180
Don't bite.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.880
And slide it in.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.880
Try it again.

13:23.960 --> 13:29.160
Good. Push it slowly in and out.
You got it.

13:29.230 --> 13:31.360
Okay.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.200
- Can I ask you something
and you promise not to laugh?
- Sure.

13:34.270 --> 13:38.770
Okay. When a guy has an orgasm,
how much comes out?

13:38.840 --> 13:41.570
A quart or so.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.940
No, I'm just kidding.

13:44.010 --> 13:46.310
Just practice.

13:54.420 --> 13:57.790
I'm not going to a morgue.
I'll get my mom to write a note.

13:57.860 --> 14:01.060
Nobody's getting me into a room
with a bunch of dead guys.

14:01.130 --> 14:04.230
You have to go.
I hear it's part of the final.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.070
I hear it's really disgusting.
Do you know what they do?

14:07.140 --> 14:09.730
- Have you heard?
- What?

14:09.810 --> 14:12.170
The bodies are dissected
and Mr. Vargas...

14:12.240 --> 14:15.470
pulls out parts of the dead body
and holds them up.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.880
You mean, he reaches in
and pulls this stuff out?

14:17.950 --> 14:22.180
- Like stomach and tumors or something?
- Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.

14:22.250 --> 14:26.710
Good day, everyone.
My name is Mr. Vargas.

14:26.790 --> 14:29.690
Look.
I'm a little slow today.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.660
I just switched to Sanka,
so have a heart.

14:33.730 --> 14:37.000
All right, now.

14:37.070 --> 14:41.030
The World of Life. That is the name
of the textbook we will be using.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.070
I'm in love.

14:44.140 --> 14:48.010
See the mustache comin' in, Rat?

14:48.080 --> 14:50.380
You can almost cross it out.

14:51.820 --> 14:57.080
- I'm in love.
- You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.

14:57.150 --> 15:01.560
What do you mean wuss?
This girl is my... exact type.

15:01.630 --> 15:04.320
- Where'd you see her?
- In my biology class.

15:04.390 --> 15:06.520
- Did you get her number?
- No.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.330
- Did you get her name?
- No! No! It's too soon.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.390
It's never too soon, Rat.

15:12.470 --> 15:16.370
A girl decides how far she's gonna
let you go in the first five minutes.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.380
What am I supposed to do? Go up to
this strange girl in my biology class...

15:20.440 --> 15:24.240
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to
take your clothes off and jump on me"?

15:24.310 --> 15:26.110
I would.

15:26.180 --> 15:29.350
I can see it all now. This is
gonna be just like last summer.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.410
You fell in love
with that girl at the Fotomat.

15:31.490 --> 15:35.750
You bought $40 worth of fuckin' film,
and you never even talked to her.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.730
You don't even own a camera!

15:37.790 --> 15:39.920
You tell me, Mike.
What should I do?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.590
This is what you do.

15:42.670 --> 15:45.860
Start from the minute
you walk into biology.

15:45.940 --> 15:49.770
I mean, don't just walk in.
Move across the room.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.430
And you don't talk to her.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.770
You use your face.
You use your body.

15:55.850 --> 15:58.370
Use everything.

15:58.450 --> 15:59.920
That's what I do.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.210
I mean, I just send out
this vibe...

16:02.290 --> 16:05.780
and I have personally found
that women do respond.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.320
I mean, something happens.

16:08.390 --> 16:10.550
Naturally something happens.

16:10.630 --> 16:13.560
You put the vibe out to 30 million
chicks, something is gonna happen.

16:13.630 --> 16:17.500
That's the idea, Rat.
That's the attitude.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.660
- The attitude?
- Yeah.

16:19.740 --> 16:23.300
The attitude dictates
that you don't care whether
she comes, stays, lays or prays.

16:23.370 --> 16:26.340
Whatever happens,
your toes are still tappin'.

16:26.410 --> 16:31.040
Now, when you got that...
then you have the attitude.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.210
- Good night, Stacy.
- Good night, Mom.

16:56.940 --> 17:02.380
<i> Just look at that girl with the lights
coming up in her eyes</i>

17:05.450 --> 17:09.410
<i> She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

17:09.490 --> 17:14.050
<i> She must be somebody's baby</i>

17:14.119 --> 17:17.359
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks. So do you.

17:18.430 --> 17:19.859
Where do you feel like going?

17:19.930 --> 17:22.130
I don't know.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.500
- How 'bout The Point?
- Okay.

17:26.569 --> 17:30.060
All right!
The Point it is.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.200
<i> She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

17:33.280 --> 17:35.400
<i> She's so fine</i>

17:35.480 --> 17:40.040
<i> She's probably somebody's only light</i>

17:40.120 --> 17:42.640
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

17:42.720 --> 17:49.560
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

17:52.300 --> 17:56.360
<i> She's gonna be somebody's only light</i>

17:56.430 --> 17:58.830
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

17:58.900 --> 18:04.770
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

18:17.150 --> 18:19.350
That's a really nice jacket.

18:19.420 --> 18:22.620
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

18:27.930 --> 18:31.420
- It's warm.
- Yeah, it is. It's really warm.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.990
I wonder how long it will last.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.970
So...

18:41.040 --> 18:44.780
am I gonna get to first base?

18:54.060 --> 18:58.790
- Are you really 19?
- Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm really 19.

19:02.500 --> 19:08.130
<i> She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

19:08.210 --> 19:14.200
<i> I try to shut my eyes
but I can't get her out of my sight</i>

19:16.150 --> 19:21.950
<i> I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>

19:24.390 --> 19:26.910
<i> I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

19:26.990 --> 19:31.930
<i> I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>

19:41.440 --> 19:45.370
<i> Gonna shine tonight
Make her mine tonight?</i>

19:45.440 --> 19:47.500
<i> Yeah</i>

19:49.610 --> 19:54.110
<i> Gonna shine tonight
Make her mine tonight</i>

19:55.520 --> 19:57.950
So tell me, do you like Ron?

19:58.020 --> 20:01.290
I like Ron, but it hurt so bad.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.020
Don't worry. Keep doing it.
It gets a lot better. I swear.

20:04.090 --> 20:05.620
It better.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.460
<i> Raised on the radio</i>

20:08.530 --> 20:12.490
<i> Just an all-American boy</i>

20:12.570 --> 20:15.600
<i> I got my favorite toy</i>

20:15.670 --> 20:20.370
<i> I was
raised on the radio</i>

20:20.440 --> 20:23.470
<i> Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

20:23.550 --> 20:26.910
<i> Remembering when times were bad</i>

20:26.980 --> 20:31.550
<i> Love is all we need
and love was all we had</i>

20:31.620 --> 20:35.280
- Mom says to clean the pool.
- Why can't you do it?

20:35.360 --> 20:37.850
Your friends use the pool.
Your friends messed it up.

20:37.930 --> 20:42.190
- Your friends use the pool too.
- I take out the garbage!

20:55.450 --> 20:57.000
Brad!

20:59.720 --> 21:04.520
- Brad, have Mom and Dad seen these?
- They're not home yet.

21:04.590 --> 21:07.280
- Brad?
- What?

21:07.360 --> 21:09.330
What would you say if
I asked you to put these...

21:09.390 --> 21:12.360
in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel
and get rid of them?

21:12.430 --> 21:16.760
- I'd say, "Who the hell is Ron Johnson?"
- Please.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.990
Thank you very much.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.830
- Lisa's great!
- Yeah.

21:24.910 --> 21:29.640
I don't understand why you want
to break up with a girl like that.

21:29.710 --> 21:34.050
Me and Lisa have been going together
for two years. I love her and all.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.210
I mean, she's great in bed.

21:37.290 --> 21:41.490
It's just that...
I'm a single, successful guy.

21:43.930 --> 21:48.490
And this is my last year in school.
This could be the best year of my life!

21:49.900 --> 21:53.200
I just feel like I need
my freedom now, you know?

21:56.670 --> 21:59.070
Okay, here's your preparation stuff.

21:59.140 --> 22:03.310
You got your sliced tomatoes,
shredded lettuce, secret sauce.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.140
- What's the secret sauce?
- Thousand Island dressing.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.710
What's the secret sauce
at Bronco Burger?

22:08.790 --> 22:11.480
- Ketchup and mayonnaise.
- Gotcha.

22:11.550 --> 22:14.020
Order for you, Bradley.

22:15.330 --> 22:18.490
- Were those flowers really for me?
- Of course!

22:18.560 --> 22:21.790
- How much did they cost?
- Don't worry about it.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.830
Want to go to The Point tonight?

22:25.070 --> 22:27.000
What's there to do at The Point?

22:27.070 --> 22:31.530
What do you mean? We've been
going out together for two years.

22:31.610 --> 22:35.770
I don't want to have to use sex
as a tool, Brad.

22:35.850 --> 22:39.780
Tool? Tool for what?
We've been going together for two years!

22:39.850 --> 22:43.150
- I don't want to talk about it here.
- I wanna talk about it!

22:43.220 --> 22:45.520
- Brad?
- Lisa!

22:45.590 --> 22:47.990
Brad!

22:48.060 --> 22:51.720
You gotta flip 'em, or they'll burn.
Great.

22:52.230 --> 22:53.790
"C."

22:53.860 --> 22:56.060
"D."

22:56.130 --> 22:58.790
"F."

22:58.870 --> 23:02.330
"F." "F."

23:02.410 --> 23:05.700
Three weeks we've been talking
about the Platt Amendment.

23:05.780 --> 23:09.070
What are you people, on dope?

23:09.150 --> 23:14.010
A piece of legislation was introduced
into Congress by Senator John Platt.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.350
It was passed in 1906.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.680
This amendment to our Constitution...

23:19.760 --> 23:22.250
has a profound impact
upon all of our...

23:22.330 --> 23:26.820
Where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier
today near the first floor bathrooms.

23:26.900 --> 23:30.730
Is he still on campus?
Anyone? Yes, Desmond?

23:30.800 --> 23:33.390
I saw him by the food machines.

23:33.470 --> 23:36.100
- How long ago?
- Right before class.

23:36.170 --> 23:38.400
Okay.
Bring him in.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.700
What is this fascination with truancy?

23:42.780 --> 23:46.610
What is it that gets inside your heads?

23:46.680 --> 23:50.520
There are some teachers in this school
who look the other way at truants.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.610
It's a little game
that you both play.

23:52.690 --> 23:55.590
They pretend they don't see you.
You pretend you don't ditch.

23:55.660 --> 23:59.360
Now, who pays the price later?
You!

24:02.030 --> 24:04.660
Wait a minute.
There's no birthday party for me here!

24:06.070 --> 24:09.200
Hola, Mr. Hand.

24:09.270 --> 24:11.740
What's the reason for your truancy?

24:11.810 --> 24:14.040
Just couldn't make it on time.

24:14.110 --> 24:16.740
You mean,
you couldn't or you wouldn't?

24:18.820 --> 24:21.380
It was like a full crowd scene
at the food lines.

24:21.450 --> 24:24.580
Food will be eaten on your time.

24:24.650 --> 24:28.220
Why are you continuously late
for this class, Mr. Spicoli?

24:28.290 --> 24:32.750
Why do you shamelessly waste
my time like this?

24:35.670 --> 24:37.600
- I don't know.
-

24:57.490 --> 24:59.850
I like that.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.620
"I don't know."
That's nice!

25:02.690 --> 25:04.920
"Mr. Hand,
will I pass this class?"

25:04.990 --> 25:08.930
"Gee, Mr. Spicoli,
I don't know!"

25:09.000 --> 25:11.520
That's nice. I really like that.
You know what I'm gonna do?

25:11.600 --> 25:15.560
I'm going to leave your words on this
board for all my classes to enjoy.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.110
Giving you full credit,
of course, Mr. Spicoli!

25:18.170 --> 25:19.970
All right.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.820
<i> Sleigh bells ring
are you listening</i>

25:33.890 --> 25:35.650
- Mommy!
- <i> In the lane</i>

25:35.730 --> 25:37.280
- Oh, no!
- <i> Snow is glistening</i>

25:37.360 --> 25:41.890
<i> A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight</i>

25:41.970 --> 25:45.160
<i> Walking in a winter wonderland</i>

25:45.400 --> 25:47.460
How fucking long
do I have to wait?

25:49.340 --> 25:51.670
Christmas sucks.
I hate it.

25:51.740 --> 25:54.540
You gotta get used to working holidays.
People are always screaming.

25:54.610 --> 25:56.840
I have to quit this job.
I'm gonna get so fat...

25:56.910 --> 26:01.820
- no one's gonna want to take me out.
- Ron hasn't called, huh?

26:01.880 --> 26:06.580
- Not since November.
- What does it matter?
He's a stereo salesman.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.420
What'd you wanna do, marry him?
Have kids with him?

26:09.490 --> 26:12.760
Have this guy come home
50 years old and bald?

26:12.830 --> 26:16.390
And have that little Pacific Stereo
sign on? Come on, Stace.

26:16.470 --> 26:18.300
Hey, it's his loss.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.430
Got any Blue Oyster Cult?

26:21.500 --> 26:24.960
No, I don't have any
Blue Oyster Cult.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.700
I ate 34 pairs last time.
Where were you?

26:28.780 --> 26:31.110
I was that close to working
at 7-Eleven, you know.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.580
What?

26:37.490 --> 26:40.350
- All right! Play me?
- Totally.

26:40.420 --> 26:42.720
You got quarters?

26:46.260 --> 26:48.700
When are those Earth, Wind and Fire
tickets comin' in?

26:48.770 --> 26:51.860
Earth, Wind and Fire?
Geez, I haven't heard anything.

26:51.930 --> 26:53.930
The minute I do,
I'll let you know.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.530
I'm plannin' on taking
my little brother over here.

26:56.610 --> 27:00.270
Is that your little brother?
He's a good-lookin' kid.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.310
Great.
Charles Jefferson...

27:02.380 --> 27:05.750
for Earth, Wind and Fire
and little brother.

27:05.820 --> 27:08.910
I'll let you know when
they come around, okay?

27:13.220 --> 27:17.250
Wow! Does he really live here?
I thought he just flew in for games.

27:17.330 --> 27:20.060
Shit! He knows where to come
when he wants some tickets.

27:20.130 --> 27:23.570
Go on. Get outta here.
You're messing up my business.

27:23.630 --> 27:26.500
Come on, Rat.
Let's go get you a woman.

27:26.570 --> 27:28.500
Wow.

27:28.570 --> 27:30.700
You ready for
your moment of truth?

27:30.770 --> 27:33.540
Damone, I noticed I was starting
to get a pimple this morning...

27:33.610 --> 27:37.940
Rat, the shyness routine
is really starting to aggravate me.

27:38.010 --> 27:42.140
I mean, who is she, anyway?
She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.

27:42.220 --> 27:46.590
Look at her. Look at you.
A member of the Honor Roll.

27:46.660 --> 27:49.820
Assistant to the assistant manager
of the movie theater.

27:49.890 --> 27:54.960
Rat, if this girl
can't smell your qualifications,
then who needs her, right?

27:55.030 --> 27:57.190
- Right.
- All right. How do you feel?

27:57.270 --> 27:59.230
- I feel good.
- Do ya? All right.

27:59.300 --> 28:02.290
Now stop fucking around
and go get her.

28:02.370 --> 28:05.860
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.

28:05.940 --> 28:08.380
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All right, that's cool.

28:08.440 --> 28:12.850
You look good. All right?
Go get her.

28:17.220 --> 28:20.680
$1.10, and you get five cents back.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.690
Thanks.

28:22.760 --> 28:26.720
- Hi! Don't I know you
from biology class?
- Yeah!

28:26.800 --> 28:31.600
- What can I do for you?
- I had a couple of questions.
I was curious.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.530
What do you do with the
jackets people leave here?

28:34.600 --> 28:37.800
- We keep 'em.
- You keep 'em?

28:37.870 --> 28:41.370
In case they come back.
You can look through it if you want.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.740
No, that's cool. It would take
too long to look through all that.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.040
I'll pick up a new one.

28:48.790 --> 28:50.840
What was your other question?

28:50.920 --> 28:55.620
Oh, my other question is...

28:55.690 --> 28:58.990
can I have your phone number
so I can ask you out sometime?

28:59.060 --> 29:03.460
- Do you have a pen?
This one's out of ink.
- Yeah.

29:14.240 --> 29:18.270
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy.
My name is Mark Ratner.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.620
I've gotta go.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.000
Lisa, I have something to tell you.

29:43.570 --> 29:47.530
Look, I'm a senior now.

29:47.610 --> 29:50.880
I'm a single, successful guy.

29:50.950 --> 29:53.680
And I've got to be fair to myself.

29:53.750 --> 29:58.450
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

30:02.860 --> 30:05.020
Oh, don't do that.

30:05.090 --> 30:07.260
- Please, please don't do that.
- Brad!

30:07.330 --> 30:11.390
- Can you cover me on register two?
- Okay.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.100
- May I help you?
- Ah, yes.

30:17.170 --> 30:19.510
This is not the best breakfast
I ever ate and...

30:19.580 --> 30:23.600
- I'd like my money back.
- Okay. I believe
you have to fill out a form.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.840
No. I'd like my money back now.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.350
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.
I have to fill out a form.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.850
Well, you ate most of it
already so...

30:32.920 --> 30:35.980
See that sign?
It says "100% guaranteed."

30:36.060 --> 30:38.790
You know what the meaning
of guarantee is?
Did they teach you that here?

30:38.860 --> 30:41.520
Sir, if you'd just wait a minute.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.530
Look. Just put your little hand
in the cash register...

30:44.600 --> 30:48.630
and give me my $2.75 back,
please, Brad.

30:48.700 --> 30:53.200
Sir, if you'd just give me a minute.
I'll find the forms.
I'll take care of everything.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.250
I don't have a minute.
You've made me late enough.

30:56.310 --> 30:59.110
I am so tired of dealing
with incompetence.

30:59.180 --> 31:02.210
It says 100% guaranteed,
you moron!

31:02.290 --> 31:06.620
Mister, if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.

31:06.690 --> 31:10.130
Ah, is there a problem here?
Can I help you, sir?

31:10.190 --> 31:15.220
You bet you have a problem.
Your employee used profanity
and threatened me with violence.

31:15.300 --> 31:18.030
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time
and usually have good service.

31:18.100 --> 31:23.090
All I wanted was my money back on this
breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.

31:23.170 --> 31:26.010
And he threatens me with violence.
I'm gonna call your super...

31:26.080 --> 31:29.310
I can take care of it.

31:29.380 --> 31:35.010
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this
customer or use profanity in any way?

31:35.080 --> 31:40.220
Uh... he insulted me first.
He called me a moron, Dennis.

31:40.290 --> 31:43.880
Answer me! Did you threaten
this customer or use profanity?

31:43.960 --> 31:46.590
- Yes.
- You're fired.

31:46.660 --> 31:50.430
I'm very sorry, sir.
I'll refund your money right now.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.430
I hope you won't hold this against us.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.200
You know how these young kids are
these days.

31:55.270 --> 31:57.710
Here we are.
Perhaps another breakfast?

31:57.770 --> 32:00.900
I hope you had
a hell of a piss, Arnold!

32:07.980 --> 32:10.920
The world's finest
surfers showed up today to do battle...

32:10.990 --> 32:15.550
with what's turned out to be the biggest
waves to hit this coast since 1946.

32:15.620 --> 32:18.060
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan,
and I'd like you to meet this young man.

32:18.130 --> 32:22.120
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
Jeff, congratulations.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.720
Things looked rough out there today.

32:24.800 --> 32:28.330
I'll tell you, Stu,
I did battle with some humongous waves.

32:28.400 --> 32:33.340
Just like I told the guy on ABC,
"Danger is my business."

32:33.410 --> 32:38.370
A lot of people
expected Mark "Cutback" Davis,
or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard...

32:38.450 --> 32:41.970
- would take the honors this year.
- Those guys are fags!

32:42.050 --> 32:45.820
Let me ask you. When you get out there,
do you ever fear for your life?

32:45.890 --> 32:50.480
Stu, surfing's not a sport.
It's a way of life. It's no hobby.

32:50.560 --> 32:55.290
It's a way of looking at that wave
and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!"

32:56.170 --> 32:57.630
Where'd you get this jacket?

32:57.700 --> 33:01.600
From the network. Let me ask you,
what's next for Jeff Spicoli?

33:01.670 --> 33:05.660
Headed over to the Australian
and then the Hawaiian Internationals.

33:05.740 --> 33:10.040
Then me and Mick are gonna wing on over
to London and jam with the Stones.

33:10.680 --> 33:14.450
You guys are invited too.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.750
Jeff! Jeff!

33:16.820 --> 33:20.020
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.

33:20.090 --> 33:23.920
- Leave me alone.
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you butthole!

33:23.990 --> 33:27.660
- Leave me alone!
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you booger!

33:27.730 --> 33:31.500
Dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!

33:33.570 --> 33:37.130
We just want to say that
we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.

33:37.210 --> 33:41.140
We always hated that name.
It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.

33:41.210 --> 33:43.770
- It's just such a put-down!
- Really!

33:43.850 --> 33:48.040
We know you've got a lot of spirit,
everybody, right?

33:48.120 --> 33:51.450
And we're gonna destroy Lincoln
next week! All right!

33:55.190 --> 33:58.560
You know, it takes a lot
of courage to get up here...

33:58.630 --> 34:01.290
and do something that
you know people will make fun of.

34:01.360 --> 34:04.560
- Yeah.
- Man...

34:04.630 --> 34:07.330
I'm never gonna talk
to those guys again.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.360
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave
their jobs there in the first place.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.340
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
I'm sure he'd take you back.

34:14.409 --> 34:17.810
Fuck Dennis Taylor!
I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.580
I'm just glad
we're still together...

34:23.650 --> 34:28.060
because a lot's happened,
and I really need you this year.

34:28.120 --> 34:32.489
Look, Brad, I've been trying
to think of a way to tell you this.

34:34.260 --> 34:38.199
We're almost out of school.
It's our last year.

34:38.270 --> 34:42.830
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to be free,

34:42.909 --> 34:46.739
to go out with other people.

34:48.739 --> 34:51.580
I still want to be friends.

34:51.650 --> 34:54.670
What do I say to her
once we get in the car?

34:54.750 --> 34:59.050
No problem, Rat. What you need
is my special five-point plan.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.280
Come on, Damone, I need real help.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.350
What'd you mean?
Men have died...

35:03.430 --> 35:06.660
trying to obtain this
valuable information.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.660
- But I'll give it to you for free.
- What's your five-point plan?

35:11.670 --> 35:15.130
All right.
Now, pay attention.

35:16.610 --> 35:21.070
First of all, you never let on
how much you like a girl.

35:21.140 --> 35:24.240
Oh, Debbie... hi.

35:25.380 --> 35:28.610
Two.
You always call the shots.

35:28.680 --> 35:32.380
Kiss me, you won't regret it.

35:32.450 --> 35:36.890
Three. Act like wherever you are,
that's the place to be.

35:38.130 --> 35:40.120
Isn't this great?

35:40.200 --> 35:42.720
Four.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.000
When ordering food, find out what she
wants, then order for the both of you.

35:46.070 --> 35:47.970
It's a classy move.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.270
The lady will have
the linguine in a white clam sauce,

35:51.340 --> 35:53.740
and a coke with no ice.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.540
And five.

35:55.610 --> 35:59.170
Now, this is most important, Rat.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.340
When it comes down to makin' out,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.410
whenever possible,

36:03.490 --> 36:05.210
put on side one
of Led Zeppelin IV.

36:16.670 --> 36:19.900
- This is a nice car.
- Yeah. It's my sister's.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.100
Yeah?

36:24.310 --> 36:26.470
Do you have Mrs. George
for English?

36:26.540 --> 36:31.040
- Yeah. She's pretty good.
- Yeah, she is pretty good.

36:38.120 --> 36:42.020
- Have you decided?
- Um, yeah.

36:42.090 --> 36:44.790
I'll have the knockwurst.

36:44.860 --> 36:47.120
Excellent.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.060
You work at Cinema Four, right?

36:50.130 --> 36:52.970
That must be great.
You get to see all those free movies.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.230
You get free popcorn.

36:56.310 --> 36:59.670
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:59.740 --> 37:02.180
Would you mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

37:02.240 --> 37:04.410
Oh, no, go ahead.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.010
Are you ready to order here?

37:09.850 --> 37:12.050
She will have the knockwurst.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.090
And you?

37:15.160 --> 37:18.020
- I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?

37:18.090 --> 37:20.530
- Coke.
- Two Cokes.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.660
Okay.
Thank you.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.160
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

37:32.540 --> 37:35.530
- Hello?
- Mike, it's Mark.

37:35.610 --> 37:39.780
- What happened to your date?
- It's happening right now.
Everything's fine except...

37:40.950 --> 37:42.880
I left my wallet at home.

37:42.950 --> 37:44.940
Why don't you go home and get it?

37:45.020 --> 37:48.150
No, I can't! I'm here.
The food's coming and everything.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.820
Look, would you do me a favor?

37:50.890 --> 37:55.630
Just borrow your mom's car, drive to my
house, get my wallet and bring it here.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.790
Hello? Mike?

37:59.870 --> 38:02.630
Mike?

38:02.710 --> 38:05.540
Geez, I'm really kinda busy, Rat.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.540
Just do me this one favor.

38:07.610 --> 38:11.270
I swear I won't ask you for anything
again in this lifetime or any other.

38:11.350 --> 38:14.480
- But just please do this for me.
- You owe me for this one.

38:14.550 --> 38:17.540
Okay, thanks.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

38:17.620 --> 38:21.950
-  Beaver, are you all right?
- What happened?

38:29.800 --> 38:32.790
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can bring you?

38:32.870 --> 38:34.800
Do you want another Coke?

38:34.870 --> 38:36.960
Um... okay.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.510
Two more Cokes.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.570
Two more Cokes.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.040
- Hey, Mark, is that you?
- Yeah, hi.

38:45.110 --> 38:48.640
- You come here?
- Yeah. I come for the strudel.
It's great.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.780
Hey, listen, I found your wallet
the other day. You want it back?

38:51.850 --> 38:54.580
Oh, wow! Yeah.
I was looking for this.

38:56.690 --> 38:58.680
Oh, Mike,
you don't know Stacy Hamilton.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.200
- Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
- Hi.

39:01.260 --> 39:04.130
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.030
See you later.

39:07.100 --> 39:11.270
Right. Gotta be goin'.
See you later.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.800
You wanna go?

39:14.880 --> 39:17.350
Um... yeah.

39:30.730 --> 39:34.060
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Me too.

39:34.130 --> 39:37.100
I'm real sorry someone broke in
and stole your tape deck.

39:37.170 --> 39:39.660
I never thought it would've happened
at such a fancy place.

39:39.740 --> 39:42.830
I know.
You want to come in for a sec?

39:45.540 --> 39:48.030
- Okay, sure.
- Good.

39:55.150 --> 39:57.980
- Where's your brother?
- He's out tonight with some friends.

39:58.050 --> 40:01.050
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, that's... that's okay.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.580
Oh. Well,
would you mind if I change?

40:05.660 --> 40:07.650
No.

40:07.730 --> 40:11.030
Okay. Could you get this for me?
It always sticks.

40:18.470 --> 40:20.240
Thanks.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.910
Where are your parents?

40:28.980 --> 40:32.250
My parents are out of town
for the weekend.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.410
Brad and I are watching the house.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.380
- This is a really nice picture of you.
- Thanks.

40:38.460 --> 40:40.720
You can come in my room
if you want.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.030
So, what do you want to do?

40:54.110 --> 40:56.480
I don't know.

40:56.550 --> 41:00.110
Um, you want to look
at a photo album?

41:00.180 --> 41:03.450
I keep a lot of pictures
from when I grew up and stuff.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.710
- It's kinda stupid, huh?
- Sure! Yeah.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.150
Yeah? Great.

41:10.990 --> 41:14.220
Photographs.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.490
This is the one that Brad took.

41:16.570 --> 41:19.660
It's like double-image type thing,
you know. It's like a mirror.

41:19.740 --> 41:23.300
This is me being stupid.

41:23.370 --> 41:27.270
And this is my dog Gypsy,
and my cat Tullio.

41:27.340 --> 41:30.940
- They're dead now.
- Remember him? Mr. Degan?

41:31.010 --> 41:33.110
You had Degan?

41:33.180 --> 41:35.450
- He always wore the same suit!
- The same suit!

41:35.520 --> 41:38.980
- He must've had 500 of those suits.
- He was terrible!

41:39.050 --> 41:41.780
No, I think it was one.

41:41.860 --> 41:47.190
<i> So you go out there
and you get one too</i>

41:47.260 --> 41:51.260
<i> Love rules</i>

41:51.330 --> 41:54.960
<i> Ohh, love rules</i>

41:56.970 --> 41:59.810
<i> Love rules</i>

42:00.910 --> 42:04.710
<i> Yeah, love rules</i>

42:07.680 --> 42:11.520
- You know, I just thought of something.
- What?

42:11.590 --> 42:14.750
My sister is crazy
when it comes to her car.

42:14.820 --> 42:16.690
- It's gotta be back by 11:00.
- Want to call her?

42:16.760 --> 42:20.750
No. Look, I... She gets crazy.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.990
Her car is her baby.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.330
- I better be going.
- Really?

42:25.400 --> 42:29.000
I'll call you.
Well, I'll see you in class. Okay?

42:29.070 --> 42:31.040
Bye.

42:31.110 --> 42:34.670
<i>Love rules</i>

42:56.970 --> 43:01.270
- Mark Ratner doesn't like me.
- Mark Ratner doesn't like you?
You're crazy!

43:01.340 --> 43:04.330
No, he shows absolutely
no interest in me.

43:04.410 --> 43:08.640
Mark Ratner is definitely somebody
you'd have to make the first move with.

43:08.710 --> 43:12.700
Linda, I did. I made the first move,
I made the second move.

43:12.780 --> 43:15.340
I made a complete jerk out of myself,
is what I did.

43:15.420 --> 43:17.540
What do you care about
Mark Ratner for?

43:17.620 --> 43:20.380
He's a 16-year-old usher
in the movie theater.

43:20.460 --> 43:24.620
You have dated older guys. You work
at the best food stand in the mall.

43:24.690 --> 43:29.220
And you are a close
personal friend of mine.

43:29.300 --> 43:33.960
Yeah. But I was really
beginning to like him.

43:34.040 --> 43:37.770
Yeah? If that's true,
you better find somebody else fast.

43:47.580 --> 43:50.750
- Seen the new Playboy?
- Good?

43:50.820 --> 43:54.260
- Bo Derek's tits!
- All right!

43:54.320 --> 43:56.310
I like sex.

44:00.600 --> 44:03.160
People on ludes
should not drive.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.900
Hey, this is my brother's car!

44:13.980 --> 44:16.340
- You said he was outta town.
- And he is.

44:16.410 --> 44:18.780
All right.
Then don't hassle it.

44:33.730 --> 44:36.360
Are you crazy, Spicoli?
That light was red!

44:36.430 --> 44:42.060
- It was yellow a minute ago.
- You're gonna scratch my brother's car.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.830
No, I'm not.

44:44.910 --> 44:48.740
Look, I'm driving.
You navigate.

44:50.210 --> 44:53.180
Where is this party?

44:53.720 --> 44:56.810
Make a right, right here.
Here! Here! Here!

45:13.500 --> 45:16.340
My brother's gonna kill us!
He's gonna kill us!

45:16.400 --> 45:20.340
He's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill us!

45:20.410 --> 45:23.000
Hey, man, just be glad
I had fast reflexes.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.710
- My brother's gonna shit!
- Make up your mind, dude.

45:26.780 --> 45:28.810
Is he gonna shit,
or is he gonna kill us?

45:28.880 --> 45:32.580
First he's gonna shit,
then he's gonna kill us.

45:32.650 --> 45:37.490
Relax, all right?
My old man is a television repairman.

45:37.560 --> 45:42.500
He's got this ultimate set of tools.
I can fix it!

45:42.560 --> 45:45.260
You can't fix this car, Spicoli!

45:50.370 --> 45:51.840
- I can fix it.
- Ha.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.380
Hey!

46:12.960 --> 46:15.490
- I'm giving you $50...
- No, no, no!

46:15.560 --> 46:18.530
That means if you win
I give you $25.

46:18.600 --> 46:21.300
If I win, you give me $5.

46:21.370 --> 46:23.860
- You can't lose.
- All right.

46:23.940 --> 46:25.910
I'll put you down for $5.

46:25.970 --> 46:29.170
Now, don't forget about
the 14-point spread.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.410
Fourteen-point sp...

46:35.180 --> 46:38.120
I don't believe those guys
at Lincoln did this to Jefferson's car!

46:38.190 --> 46:41.450
They totalled it.
I can't believe it.

46:43.790 --> 46:47.280
Jefferson's gonna really make
Lincoln pay for this.

46:48.660 --> 46:51.150
That guy's gonna totally
destroy them.

46:51.230 --> 46:53.260
Annihilate.
You know what I mean?

46:56.040 --> 46:57.770
Shit, he is pissed off.

47:15.990 --> 47:21.120
<i> They may well mean
what they say about you</i>

47:21.200 --> 47:24.460
<i> You might wander back
to future friends</i>

47:31.510 --> 47:36.710
<i> Come too close
and take you by the hand</i>

47:36.750 --> 47:41.380
<i> 'Cause now you see there's more
to life then what we lovers do</i>

47:41.450 --> 47:44.180
- Oh, shit!
- Hut. Hut.

47:52.530 --> 47:55.960
Brought down again
by 33, Charles Jefferson.

47:56.030 --> 48:00.370
Hit by Jefferson.
Crushed by Jefferson.

48:00.440 --> 48:05.200
Man! Jefferson. Jefferson.
Jefferson. Jefferson.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.070
Jefferson.

48:08.140 --> 48:09.740
Stretcher!

48:13.950 --> 48:16.380
Again by Jefferson.

48:23.890 --> 48:27.920
Five, four, three, two, one!

48:32.630 --> 48:35.130
- There's nothing to eat here.
- What do you mean?

48:35.200 --> 48:37.730
- Take a look. There's nothing I can eat.
- Get a trout dog.

48:37.810 --> 48:40.470
Forget it. Do you have any fish here
that isn't breaded?

48:40.540 --> 48:43.600
- It's all prepared the same way.
- Get a whaler.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.670
Or a clamwich.

48:45.750 --> 48:48.180
Ever hear the word blemish?
Want me to eat something fried?

48:48.250 --> 48:51.010
- Let's get outta here.
- Let's go.

48:52.990 --> 48:56.290
Thank you.
Come again, and have a nice day.

48:58.990 --> 49:02.520
I sent a letter to Doug today.
Can't wait 'til he gets out here.

49:02.600 --> 49:07.090
- What's Doug doing in Chicago?
- He works for the airline.
You'll meet him.

49:07.170 --> 49:09.530
Oh, Linda, you have to do this.

49:09.600 --> 49:12.370
- What?
- "Rate Your Mate."

49:12.440 --> 49:14.410
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

49:14.480 --> 49:16.410
- Let me test Doug.
- Okay.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.570
"Most satisfactory
lovemaking occurs:

49:18.650 --> 49:20.670
"A, when your mate climaxes first.

49:20.750 --> 49:24.210
B, you climax first.
C, you and your mate climax together?"

49:24.290 --> 49:26.050
Climax together.

49:26.120 --> 49:29.060
This is gonna be great, Rat.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.590
It's like the highlight of their day.

49:31.660 --> 49:34.180
Maybe we oughta call first. I don't know
about dropping in like this.

49:34.260 --> 49:36.860
Are you kiddin'?
We're gonna surprise 'em.

49:36.930 --> 49:39.130
Just fix your collar, all right?

49:39.200 --> 49:42.730
Relax. Just be cool.
Attitude, remember?

49:42.800 --> 49:45.860
- Where'd you get that, the hamper?
- Hey, this is clean.

49:45.940 --> 49:48.670
It's like riding a bike.
You fall off, you get right back on.

49:48.740 --> 49:51.140
You mess up a date, do it again!

49:52.280 --> 49:54.610
- Do you always climax with Doug?
- Yes.

49:57.050 --> 50:00.850
I think so.
He's no high school boy.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.450
Hey!

50:03.530 --> 50:06.520
Come over to help you
with your math homework.

50:06.590 --> 50:09.090
Figured you could use it
on such a hot day.

50:09.160 --> 50:12.690
Don't worry.
They're gonna let us in.

50:12.770 --> 50:14.700
Okay.

50:20.480 --> 50:25.170
- Promise you're going to leave
as soon as my mother gets home.
- Okay.

50:25.250 --> 50:29.620
- Linda, this is Mike and Mark.
- How you doin'?

50:29.680 --> 50:33.380
The water looks great.
Check it out.

50:35.520 --> 50:38.250
Looks fine.
Wai...

50:39.230 --> 50:42.460
Very funny!
Very funny!

50:51.210 --> 50:54.300
-  Lin, come in!
-  I'll teach you to dive.

50:54.380 --> 50:56.970
I used to be a champion, you know.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.910
Does Mom know you have company?

51:09.990 --> 51:12.190
It's just Mark and Mike from school.

51:12.260 --> 51:14.750
- Hi.
-  How ya doin'?

51:14.830 --> 51:16.760
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Brad.

51:19.230 --> 51:24.500
Uh, could you keep it down?
I have work to do inside.

51:24.570 --> 51:26.200
Okay.

51:26.270 --> 51:28.270
Who's his tailor?

51:28.340 --> 51:31.780
God, he hardly even talks anymore.

51:31.850 --> 51:35.110
Yeah, I know.
He hates wearing a uniform.

51:35.180 --> 51:37.740
Rat, show them
how you can stand up underwater.

51:42.220 --> 51:44.050
What are you doing?

51:44.130 --> 51:46.820
- Watch out, Rat!
- Leave me alone!

51:47.030 --> 51:50.160
All right, Damone,
you're gonna get it.

52:05.450 --> 52:08.070
Hi, Brad.

52:08.150 --> 52:11.080
You know how cute
I always thought you were.

52:48.820 --> 52:52.420
Stacy, do you have Q-tips?
I've got water in my ears.

52:52.490 --> 52:54.930
I don't know.
Check in the house.

52:59.100 --> 53:01.630
Wait. Just a minute.

53:07.740 --> 53:10.210
Doesn't anybody
fucking knock anymore?

53:24.630 --> 53:28.760
In 1898, Spain owned Cuba outright.

53:28.830 --> 53:30.760
Think about it.

53:30.830 --> 53:35.500
Cuba owned by a disorganized
parliament 4,000 miles away.

53:35.570 --> 53:38.730
Cubans were in a constant...

53:42.110 --> 53:45.270
Cubans were in
a constant state of revolt.

53:45.350 --> 53:47.310
In 1904...

53:47.380 --> 53:51.510
the United States decided
to throw weight around...

53:54.520 --> 53:56.990
- Who is it?
- Mr. Pizza Guy.

53:57.060 --> 53:59.080
- Again?
- Mr. Pizza Guy, sir.

54:05.130 --> 54:08.630
- Who ordered
the double cheese and sausage?
- Right here, dude.

54:16.780 --> 54:19.340
For you, dude.

54:26.620 --> 54:31.060
Am I hallucinating? What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

54:31.130 --> 54:33.060
Learning about Cuba,
and having some food.

54:33.290 --> 54:35.690
Mr. Spicoli,
you're on dangerous ground.

54:35.760 --> 54:38.700
You're causing a major disturbance
on my time.

54:38.770 --> 54:42.700
I've been thinking about this,
Mr. Hand.

54:42.770 --> 54:47.070
If I'm here and you're here,
doesn't that make it "our" time?

54:47.140 --> 54:51.010
There's nothing wrong
with a feast on "our" time.

54:51.080 --> 54:55.520
You're absolutely right.
It is our time.

54:55.580 --> 54:59.750
Yours, mine and everyone else's
in this room.

54:59.820 --> 55:04.420
But it is my class.
Hamilton, Brandt, Cornfeld, up front!

55:04.490 --> 55:07.520
Mr. Spicoli has been kind enough
to bring us a snack.

55:07.600 --> 55:10.660
Be my guest.
Help yourselves.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.600
Get a good one.

55:19.670 --> 55:22.800
- Mike? Mike? Hi.
- Hi.

55:22.880 --> 55:25.810
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

55:25.880 --> 55:29.340
I hate walking. I have to walk
every day. It's such a drag.

55:29.420 --> 55:31.440
Why don't you get a ride
with somebody?

55:31.520 --> 55:34.610
Sometimes I ride with my brother,
but he works mornings.

55:34.690 --> 55:38.390
- Then he drives himself to school.
- What a guy!

55:38.460 --> 55:42.730
Listen, Mark Ratner
really likes you.

55:42.800 --> 55:47.330
- Do you like him?
- Mark is really nice.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.630
But I think I like you.

56:00.380 --> 56:03.820
Well, uh... this is me.

56:05.090 --> 56:07.750
- Do you have any iced tea?
- Yeah, sure.

56:07.820 --> 56:09.790
Come on in.

56:12.790 --> 56:15.960
The annuals are coming out
pretty soon.

56:16.030 --> 56:19.730
- You gonna get one?
- I don't know.

56:19.800 --> 56:24.070
Oh, come on. Aren't you curious
to see how your picture turned out?

56:24.140 --> 56:26.770
- I know what I look like.
- I know.

56:26.840 --> 56:30.240
But it's nice to have pictures
of your friends and stuff.

56:30.310 --> 56:33.180
I don't know. Maybe.
It's no big deal.

56:33.250 --> 56:36.310
I probably will.

56:36.380 --> 56:38.320
Must be nice having a pool.

56:38.390 --> 56:41.150
- You want to go swimming?
- Yeah, sure.

56:41.220 --> 56:44.590
- I'm going to go change, okay?
- Yeah.

56:44.660 --> 56:45.750
Okay, great.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.930
This is great iced tea.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.370
- Come on.
- Huh?

57:03.440 --> 57:05.710
Brad keeps his stuff
in the change room.

57:17.830 --> 57:19.820
- This is nice.
- Yeah?

57:19.890 --> 57:23.890
- Yeah.
- These'll fit you.

57:35.980 --> 57:39.740
- You're really a good kisser.
- Yeah?

57:39.810 --> 57:41.840
So are you.

57:48.690 --> 57:51.750
You want to take off
your clothes, Mike?

57:51.830 --> 57:54.560
You first.

57:54.630 --> 57:58.330
Both of us at the same time.

57:58.400 --> 58:00.330
Okay.

58:03.300 --> 58:07.000
<i> She's gonna be
somebody's only light</i>

58:07.070 --> 58:10.040
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

58:10.110 --> 58:17.240
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

58:17.320 --> 58:23.260
<i> I try to shut my eyes
but I can't get her out of my sight</i>

58:26.090 --> 58:31.120
<i> I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>

58:33.630 --> 58:36.470
- Wait.
- <i> I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

58:36.540 --> 58:39.270
- <i> I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>
- M-Mike! Mike!

58:44.010 --> 58:46.070
Are you okay?

58:46.150 --> 58:48.210
Ahh.

58:48.280 --> 58:51.580
I think I came.
Didn't you feel it?

58:52.650 --> 58:54.140
Yeah. I guess I did.

58:57.660 --> 59:00.290
I gotta go, Stacy.

59:00.360 --> 59:02.920
I've really gotta go.

59:17.040 --> 59:19.980
- See ya.
- Bye.

59:21.180 --> 59:24.410
Linda, how long does Doug take?

59:24.490 --> 59:27.390
- Doug takes forever.
- Come on.

59:27.460 --> 59:31.150
He takes, uh... 20 to 30 minutes.

59:31.230 --> 59:34.560
I thought you said
he took 30 to 40 minutes.

59:34.630 --> 59:38.260
That's right. I'm sorry.
I meant 30 to 40 minutes.

59:38.330 --> 59:40.360
How long did Damone take?

59:40.430 --> 59:45.870
Damone took, uh...
15 to 20 minutes.

59:45.940 --> 59:49.710
That's not bad for a high school boy.

59:52.210 --> 59:55.310
<i> Raised on the radio</i>

59:55.380 --> 59:57.940
<i> Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.320
<i> Just like an all-American boy</i>

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:04.120
- Mike! Hi!
- Hi.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:07.390
- God, I haven't seen you for a while.
- Yeah.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.950
- In a hurry. Got stuff I gotta do.
- I'm in a hurry too.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:14.090
- I just thought I'd say hi to you.
- Hi.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.210
Hamilton, I'll take over
the fryer for a while.

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:23.570
Those boys at I.B.M. Ordered a stack
of those Catch-of-the-Day boxes.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:28.050
- I told them you would personally
deliver them within the hour.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.420
Hamilton, come over here.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.090
- What are you doing?
- I'm changing.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.130
You took off your Captain Hook uniform.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.100
I thought I'd put street clothes on
for the drive to I.B.M.

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:53.110
The uniform's uncomfortable.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:57.610
You're going there as a representative
of Captain Hook Fish and Chips.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.980
Part of our image, part of our appeal
is that uniform. You know that.

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.450
You want me to put
the stuff back on?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.110
Yes, I do. Show a little pride.

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:08.820
Aye, aye, sir.

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:19.220
<i> Talk on the phone
Call up the coast</i>

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.330
<i> Call it collect
Dial direct</i>

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.400
<i> Reverse the charges
If they accept, they're home</i>

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.410
<i> Or you can go overseas
Speak Japanese</i>

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.610
<i> Buy a new Sony
They make great TVs</i>

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:44.120
<i> Do the Watusi
Watch I Love Lucy too</i>

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.880
<i> But don't let nobody</i>

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:10.080
<i> Tell ya that
there's nothin' to do</i>

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.990
<i> Well, well, well, well
Don't let nobody</i>

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:17.790
<i> Tell ya that
there's nothin' to do</i>

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:24.520
Dina, can you honestly tell me
that you forgot?

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.630
Forgot the magnetism of Robin Zander
or the charisma of Rick Nielsen?

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.690
- That's kid stuff.
- Kid stuff?

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:36.270
How 'bout the tunes?
<i> I want you to want me</i>

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.470
<i> The dream police
Da-na-na-na-na-na</i>

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:42.520
<i> Your mama's all right
Your daddy's all right</i>

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:46.880
- <i> They just seem a little bit weird</i>
- Mike? Mike?

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:49.890
Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.830
Stacy, I'm doing business.
Call me tonight, all right?

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.800
No. I've gotta talk to you now.
Okay?

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.260
Don't go away.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.310
Look at 'em.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:10.840
I hope this is important
because I could be blowin' a big deal.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.940
Mike, I just...

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:16.450
I just want you to know
that I'm pregnant.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:22.350
How do you know it's mine?
We only did it once.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.390
I haven't been with anybody else.
I know it's yours.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.720
Jesus!
It was your idea.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.560
You wanted to do it.
You wanted it more than I did.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.930
No.
Take that back.

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:39.200
All right.
I take it back.

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:42.610
Look, we gotta do somethin' about it.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.770
I mean, uh,
we gotta get an abortion.

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:49.610
My brother Art got his girlfriend
one once. It's simple.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.710
- It's no big deal.
- Yeah. I got that planned.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:58.720
It's going to cost $150
at the Free Clinic.

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:02.490
Doesn't sound free to me.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.230
I suppose you want me
to pay for it.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.290
Half, okay?
And a ride to the clinic.

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.840
Seventy-five dollars and a ride.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.900
Okay.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.240
Okay. Thanks.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.320
Thank you.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.350
God.

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:29.990
Rick, I need that $50 you owe me.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:34.590
- Don't have it.
- I know times are tight,
but I really need it.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:38.830
- Don't have it now.
- When you needed the tickets,
I got 'em for you.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.270
So close to stage
you probably scared the band.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.770
I'm not the Bank of America.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.900
I know you're not the Bank of America,
but I need my $50.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:50.740
- How about Thursday?
- Thursday's too late.
I need it tonight.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:53.370
Can't give you what I don't have.

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:58.150
Just forget about it.
I'll get it from you Thursday, okay?

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.620
All right.
See ya.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.230
<i> Flowers</i>

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.660
<i> And the vine</i>

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.170
<i> Take me</i>

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.930
<i> Sleeping angel</i>

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:24.140
<i> Catch me when you can</i>

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:28.310
<i> Feel love better</i>

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.410
<i> Heavy steps for a woman</i>

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:34.980
<i> And a man</i>

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.920
Is Mike there?
This is Stacy.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.020
Hold on, please.

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:43.430
Stacy, he says he's helping
his father in the garage.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.930
He'll call you later.

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:50.060
Brad!

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.500
Wait a second.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.370
- Yeah, this is it.
We're just going bowling.
- Okay.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.380
- Thanks a lot.
- See you later.

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:02.380
Okay.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.200
- How we doing in here?
Debbie, you ready to leave?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.260
Stacy, I can't let you go
unless you have a ride home.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:29.780
- Oh. I told my boyfriend
to meet me downstairs.
- Okay.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.830
Thanks.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.850
Brad.

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:48.960
Since when do you
go bowling anyway?

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:52.260
Okay, Brad.
Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:55.600
Come on!
Who did it?

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.980
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:09.950
Okay.
It'll just be your secret.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.950
Okay.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.350
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.480
Come on.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.850
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:29.430
I told you to tell Mike to pay for it.
Why didn't you tell him?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.870
Linda, he didn't show up.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.670
That little prick!

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.710
I called his house.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:41.270
His mother told me he was
in the garage helping his father.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:44.280
Mike Damone's
a no-brain little prick, Stacy.

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.320
I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:51.650
Linda, please don't do anything.
I don't even like the guy.

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:56.030
Stacy, he's not a guy.
He's a little prick!

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.640
<i> I can't explain the way I feel</i>

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.000
<i> Each time I get behind the wheel</i>

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:19.410
<i> A rush of blood
comes after power surges</i>

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:25.120
<i> And my right foot urges
the car to push</i>

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:28.250
Hi, Mikey!

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:42.740
Hi, Damone.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.120
Damone, what went on
between you and Stacy?

01:08:57.189 --> 01:09:01.290
Let me tell you something.
Sometimes girls go haywire.

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:05.660
It happened a month ago.
I've been trying to think
of a way to tell you ever since.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:09.600
We were out... messin' around,
and something happened.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.470
It's over.
It's no big deal.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.470
I never even called her again.

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:20.979
If you ask me,
she's a very aggressive girl.

01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:23.880
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:28.319
- She never really was your girlfriend.
- Fuck you, Damone.

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:32.920
There are a lot of girls out there,
and you have to mess around with Stacy?

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:35.520
What do you gotta prove, anyway?

01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:38.359
I'm sorry.

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:41.060
I always stick up for you.

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:45.370
Whenever people say, "That Damone, he's
a loudmouth," and they say that a lot,

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.200
I always say,
"Hey, you just don't know Damone."

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:52.140
When they call you an idiot,
I say, "Damone's not an idiot.
You just don't know him."

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:56.980
Well, you know something, man?
Maybe they do know you pretty good.

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.180
Maybe I'm just finding out now.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.190
Get lost.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.390
You want to do something about it, Rat?

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.290
You want to do something about it?
Come on.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.560
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay. Let's go, man.

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:14.290
- I'll break your fuckin' head off.
- Do something, man.

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:17.930
- A big talker, man!
- Knock this crap off!

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:20.340
Take it somewhere else.

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.070
Not in my gym, buddy.

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:30.970
Shit.

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:38.860
Woke up in a great mood.
I don't know what the hell happened.

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:43.650
Come on. Hurry up.
Hurry up.

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:48.900
Today we're going to explore
how this hospital preserves human life.

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:53.300
We'll be visiting every floor
where these fine doctors and nurses...

01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:57.070
take care of us in life...
and in death.

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:08.310
Over 30 children
are delivered here each day.

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.750
Dr. Kramer to the nurses' station.

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.550
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Hi.

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:15.560
Class, this is Dr. Miller.

01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:18.690
He'll be joining us
for the last part of our tour today.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:21.530
If you guys will follow me, please.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.470
I'd like to ask you one last time.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.270
Conduct yourselves
with the utmost maturity.

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.970
- You in my class?
- I am today.

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:48.820
-  Yes, Greg?
- Who are these guys?

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.330
Most of them are derelicts.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.420
They sold their bodies
to medicine for money.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.940
- About $30, I think?
- Twenty-five.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.270
Righteous bucks!

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.670
This gentleman here is named Arthur.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.040
Arthur was good enough
to die last week of heart failure.

01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:10.070
We are fortunate today
to view his body...

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:12.640
in its pristine state.

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:19.160
Here an incision has been made.

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:21.290
The ribs have been sawed off,

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.230
allowing us to remove
the breastplate...

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.830
and really observe the human organs
as they exist in their natural state.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.030
Here we have the human lungs.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.870
And here is the human heart
which, you can see,

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:41.240
is actually located
in the center of your chest.

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:43.780
Ohh! Gnarly!

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.990
Are you okay?

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.460
Yeah.
I'm fine.

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:02.230
- I just made a jerk out of myself.
- No, you didn't.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.430
Can't go back in there.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.940
Sure. We'll wait until they come out,
and then we'll blend in.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:12.070
Here they come.

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.170
You're so nice.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.730
<i> I don't know, I don't know
which way I should go</i>

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:46.750
<i> I don't know</i>

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.410
<i> I don't know</i>

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.620
<i> I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>

01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:00.680
<i> I don't know</i>

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:05.560
<i> I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:07.120
<i> I don't know</i>

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.070
<i> I don't know</i>

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:31.680
<i> I don't know</i>

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:41.160
You should be comin' on pretty soon,
dude. How much did you smoke?

01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:44.860
This'll be
a little demonstration of that.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.870
Listen up.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.340
- What was that?
- That was my skull.

01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:53.810
-
- I'm so wasted!

01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:56.510
Oh, man!

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.780
What is this stuff?

01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:02.120
Doesn't that stuff
cause brain damage?

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:06.220
- Only if you take it
every day for a month.
- Bitchin'!

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:10.460
- Dude, I'll pick you up in
the van and go to the dance.
- Later.

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:13.290
Jeff, you have company.

01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:17.300
Get out of here, Curtis.
I don't hear you unless you knock.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.130
That's better. Entre.

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:29.070
Mr. Hand!

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:32.880
Well, were you going somewhere
tonight, Jeff?

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.980
Yeah.
The graduation dance.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.250
It's the last school fiesta
of the year.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.160
Hmm. I'm afraid we've got
some business to discuss here.

01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:43.320
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.660
According to my calculations,
Mr. Spicoli,

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:52.760
you wasted a total of, uh,
eight hours of my time this year.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.170
And rest assured,
that is a kind estimate.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.410
Now I have the unique pleasure
of squaring our account.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.750
Tonight you and I are going to talk in
great detail about the Davis Agreement,

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:11.520
all the associated treaties, and
the American Revolution in particular.

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:16.460
If you can turn to page 47
of Land of Truth and Liberty.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:20.800
Oh, I left that book in my locker,
Mr. Hand.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:25.100
In that case, I'm glad I remembered to
bring an extra copy... just for you.

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:54.400
<i> He was a hardheaded man
He was brutally handsome</i>

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:58.230
<i> And she was terminally pretty</i>

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.830
<i> She held him up
and he held her for ransom</i>

01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:06.350
<i> In the heart
of the cold, cold city</i>

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:08.070
<i> He had a nasty reputation
as a cruel dude</i>

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:09.580
Look, Mark.

01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:13.590
I want to apologize for
everything that's happened.

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:15.680
I'm really sorry.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.810
A guy just doesn't do that to a buddy.

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:19.920
I understand.
You can't help it.

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:22.290
You're just lewd,
crude and obnoxious.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.760
- I can deal with that.
- Excuse me.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.830
Are we still friends?

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.640
- Huh?
- Okay.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:38.640
All right.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:42.350
What Jefferson
was saying was, "Hey!

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.580
"We left this England place
'cause it was bogus.

01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.550
"So if we don't get some cool rules
ourselves... pronto,

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.220
we'll just be bogus too."

01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:56.090
Very close, Jeff.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.370
I think I've made my point with you
tonight.

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:05.560
Do you have a guy like me
in class every year?

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.470
You know,
a guy who you make an example of?

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.980
- You'll find out next year.
- No way!

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:15.910
As soon as I cruise history, I'm not
coming near your side of the building.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.110
- "Cruise history"?
- Soon as I pass your class.

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:22.210
Ooh. If you pass.

01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:24.690
You're gonna flunk me?

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.220
Don't worry, Spicoli.
You'll probably squeak by.

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.320
Yeah! Aloha, Mr. Hand.

01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.600
Aloha, Spicoli.

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:47.170
Honey,
these are my two star students.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:49.940
Boys, I'd like you to meet
my wife, Mrs. Vargas.

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.950
Hi.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.130
Summer!
Yea!

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.830
Totally!

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.570
I wrote him a letter.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.080
Tell me what you think.
"Dear Doug.

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.370
"I received your message that
you weren't coming to my graduation.

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:23.280
"Doug, this is not the kind of thing
that occurs between adults.

01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:28.220
"Maybe you've found someone new,
someone more mature.

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:32.350
"But if you ask me, Doug,
you're the one being childish.

01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:36.050
"Anyhow, if you think I'm gonna
sit around and wait for you, forget it.

01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:39.500
- Sincerely, Linda." What do you think?
- Uh...

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:41.500
I have another version
where I call him an asshole.

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:43.970
No, that one's better.
It's more...

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.970
- Mature?
- Yeah.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.440
- I don't have to sink to his level.
- Yeah.

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:51.140
- I can go out with anyone I want,
practically.
- That's right.

01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:55.110
Yeah.
Thanks for cheering me up.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.970
Come on.

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.750
Hey, dude!
I know that song.

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.040
Hey, I'm not.
I'm not.

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:21.370
<i> Mattie told Hattie</i>

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.840
<i> About the things you do</i>

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:26.950
Hey, come on down
from there.

01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:29.280
<i> To wooly bully with you</i>

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.320
- <i> Wooly bully</i>
- Whaa!

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:33.850
<i> Wooly bully</i>

01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:37.550
<i> Wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:40.680
<i> Wooly bully</i>

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:44.700
<i> Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.600
<i> Wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:51.500
<i> Wooly bully</i>

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:07.520
Linda, I finally figured it out.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:11.890
I don't want sex.
Anyone can have sex.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:15.490
- What do you want?
- I want a relationship.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.000
- I want romance.
- You want romance?

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:24.090
In Ridgemont? We can't even get
cable TV here, and you want romance.

01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:31.030
Another summer at Perry's.
I can't. I swear.

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:33.100
It's not that bad.
Keep your eyes open.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.080
There's lots of men around here.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.640
<i> As we strolled by the sea</i>

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.250
<i> Together</i>

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.090
<i> Under stars twinkling
high above</i>

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.720
<i> So in love are we two</i>

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.060
<i> No one else but me and you</i>

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.330
- <i> So in love</i>
- <i> Two so in love</i>

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.860
- <i> So much in love</i>
- <i> Two so in love</i>

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.880
- <i> So in love</i>
- <i> Two so in love</i>

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:08.070
- <i> Are you and I</i>
- <i> Two, you and I</i>

01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:10.670
- <i> So in love</i> ?
- Hi.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.220
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.810
I'm glad you came over...

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.910
'cause I have this picture of me
that I wanted to give to you...

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:22.330
so that you'll remember
to call me over the summer.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.200
I don't know. I'm going to be traveling
a lot this summer and I'm not sure...

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.000
I'll give you a call sometime.

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:38.070
- That'd be great.
-  Stacy!

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.490
- You worked at All-American Burger!
- Seven months ago.

01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:05.700
Uh-huh.
I knew it.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.590
Why don't you get a job,
Spicoli?

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.720
- What for?
- You need money.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.820
All I need are some tasty waves,

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.090
a cool buzz, and I'm fine.

01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:39.500
Thanks.
Can I use your bathroom?

01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:43.140
Yeah, go ahead.

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:46.240
- It's the first door on the left.
- Like up this ramp?

01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:50.210
First door on the left.

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:58.250
Money, and I want it now.
Now!

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.660
- Okay. Okay. Um...
- Now!

01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:03.620
What are you doin'?

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.220
The safe!
Behind the doughnuts.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.890
I've been watchin' this place.
I know what I'm doin'.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.600
- Open it up. Open it up!
- Okay.

01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:15.370
C'mon! C'mon!

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.970
I just started here. They just
taught me the procedure and I...

01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:22.310
Let me figure it out.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:25.980
- Come on, shit head. Let's go.
- Get off my case, motherfucker!

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:28.280
Hey, no towels, man.

01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:37.460
- I got you, you son of a bitch.
- Oh, motherfucker!

01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:39.460
There goes your ride home.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:42.090
Awesome! Totally awesome!

01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:43.760
All right, Hamilton.

01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:00.420
<i> Oh, I know something</i>

01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:03.110
<i> About the ways of loving</i>

01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:05.660
<i> But I could tell you baby</i>

01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:08.320
<i> That something's wrong</i>

01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:14.060
<i> Look to the sky above
and the mud below</i>

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:16.430
<i> Something's driving me crazy</i>

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.300
<i> Got to got to get away</i>

01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:23.210
<i> Bye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye</i>

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.570
<i> Without a doubt</i>

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:28.380
<i> I'm telling you
I'm burnt out</i>

01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:32.580
<i> My tank is running on empty</i>

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:35.680
<i> For far too long
I need fuel</i>

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.250
<i> 'Cause I'm getting so low</i>

01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:42.490
<i> Something drives me crazy</i>

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.500
<i> So bad</i>

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.000
<i> Bye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:06.520
<i> I need fuel</i>

01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:09.180
<i> Not the kind you give me</i>

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:11.520
<i> Makes me feel so bad</i>

01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:15.430
