WEBVTT

00:09.040 --> 00:11.782
DONALD, I JUST
NOTICED THE HOLIDAY
CARD WE MAILED OUT.

00:11.782 --> 00:14.085
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE FAMILY PORTRAIT WE TOOK

00:14.085 --> 00:16.187
TO CELEBRATE OUR FIRST
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER?

00:16.187 --> 00:17.688
( chuckling )
OH, I SHREDDED THOSE.

00:17.688 --> 00:19.350
THESE ARE WAY
MORE FESTIVE.

00:23.694 --> 00:26.257
WHO WANTS
A CHRISTMAS COOKIE?

00:26.257 --> 00:28.099
ADAM, THOSE
AREN'T EVEN COOKED.

00:28.099 --> 00:31.262
OH, NO PROBLEM.
( sighs )

00:34.405 --> 00:35.806
CAREFUL, THEY MAY BE HOT.

00:37.608 --> 00:38.769
( blowing )

00:40.571 --> 00:45.746
OKAY, WHO COVERED THE ENTIRE
HOUSE IN BLINKING LIGHTS?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.448
PEOPLE ALREADY
THINK WE'RE WEIRD,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.420
WE DON'T NEED TO
SHINE A LIGHT ON IT.

00:49.420 --> 00:53.584
NO, I DID THAT. I WANT
TO MAKE SURE SANTA CLAUS
COMES TO OUR HOUSE FIRST.

00:55.086 --> 00:57.688
ADAM, WE ALL LOVE
CHRISTMAS,

00:57.688 --> 01:00.231
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GOING
A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

01:00.231 --> 01:03.063
( banging noise )

01:04.595 --> 01:06.667
( laughing )

01:06.667 --> 01:08.569
THAT, HOWEVER, IS SPOT ON.

01:10.441 --> 01:13.674
HEY, GET BACK UP ON THE ROOF.
YOU'RE RUINING MY DISPLAY.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.577
YOU WERE LUCKY A RACCOON
CHEWED ME FREE!

01:16.577 --> 01:19.610
( alarm sounding )

01:19.610 --> 01:22.183
THAT'S AN URGENT MISSION ALERT.
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE LAB.

01:23.714 --> 01:26.086
HELLO? A LITTLE HELP?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.388
( grunting )

01:29.120 --> 01:30.321
( yelling )

01:32.793 --> 01:34.665
THE ALERT IS COMING
FROM FACILITY X,

01:34.665 --> 01:36.627
MY RESEARCH CENTER
IN THE FROZEN TUNDRA.

01:36.627 --> 01:40.701
HEY, HEY, I'M THE MISSION
SPECIALIST. I'LL HANDLE THIS.

01:42.573 --> 01:44.175
THE ALERT IS COMING
FROM FACILITY X,

01:44.175 --> 01:45.776
HIS RESEARCH CENTER
IN THE FROZEN TUNDRA.

01:47.238 --> 01:49.680
WAIT. THE TUNDRA'S
NEAR THE NORTH POLE.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.342
( gasping )
SANTA NEEDS OUR HELP!

01:51.342 --> 01:53.584
YOU WRAP, YOU TAPE,
I'LL GO HANG WITH THE ELVES.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.587
DR. EVANS.
ARE YOU THERE?

01:58.149 --> 02:01.192
YEAH, I'M HERE.
ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR

02:01.192 --> 02:04.455
VOLCANIC ERUPTION NEARBY AND
WE'RE EXPERIENCING AFTERSHOCKS.

02:04.455 --> 02:06.697
I'M AFRAID IF WE
DON'T ACT FAST...

02:08.359 --> 02:11.502
OH, MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU, TOO, DR. EVANS.

02:11.502 --> 02:13.464
RUDE.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.806
SORRY, GUYS.
I KNOW THE TIMING'S NOT IDEAL.

02:15.806 --> 02:18.369
IT'S OKAY, MR. DAVENPORT.
WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

02:18.369 --> 02:22.613
YEP. LET'S CRACK OPEN
SOME EGGNOG AND HIT IT
HARD AFTER THE NEW YEAR.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.919
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

02:28.919 --> 02:33.224
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:33.224 --> 02:35.586
THE NEXT GENERATION OF
THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:35.586 --> 02:37.788
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:37.788 --> 02:40.531

02:40.531 --> 02:41.692

02:43.694 --> 02:45.436

03:16.797 --> 03:17.968
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS HAVE TO GO

03:17.968 --> 03:20.331
ON A MISSION
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

03:20.331 --> 03:21.872
JUST TO BE CLEAR,
I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT

03:21.872 --> 03:23.734
FOR THEM TO OPEN MY PRESENTS,
RIGHT?

03:25.436 --> 03:27.738
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS
RUIN MY CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

03:27.738 --> 03:30.941
SO, I WILL BE WEARING
MY SANTA HAT.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.745
REALLY, ADAM? A SANTA HAT
WITH A MISSION SUIT?

03:34.745 --> 03:37.788
HEY, IF THE LADIES AT THE BANK
CAN WEAR THEM AT WORK, SO CAN I.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.922
I CAN'T RE-ESTABLISH CONTACT
WITH DR. EVANS.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.596
THE VOLCANO MUST HAVE KNOCKED
OUT SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.

03:45.596 --> 03:48.929
THIS GIANT ASH CLOUD HAS PLUNGED
THE AREA INTO TOTAL DARKNESS.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.662
THERE IS NO WAY RESCUE TEAMS
WILL BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.634
WELL, THAT MEANS
DR. EVANS IS TRAPPED.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.935
EH, HE'S BETTER OFF.
THE AIRPORTS ARE

03:54.935 --> 03:56.637
PACKED THIS TIME OF YEAR.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.940
THERE'S AN AUTOMATED
TRANSPORT READY
TO TAKE YOU UP THERE,

03:59.940 --> 04:01.712
BUT WITHOUT SATELLITE
COMMUNICATIONS,

04:01.712 --> 04:03.774
LEO AND I WON'T
BE ON THE COMM SET.

04:03.774 --> 04:06.417
AH, WELL, IT WILL BE TOUGH
NAVIGATING THROUGH A MISSION

04:06.417 --> 04:09.450
WITHOUT THE CONSTANT SOUND OF
LEO CHOMPING ON CARROT STICKS.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.924
HEY, YOU KNOW
I'M A STRESS EATER.

04:16.527 --> 04:17.928
( doorbell ringing )

04:17.928 --> 04:20.891
OH, I GOT IT. MUST BE GRANDMA
WITH HER HOLIDAY FEAST.

04:20.891 --> 04:25.296
OR PERHAPS SOME CAROLERS
HAVE COME TO SPREAD
SOME HOLIDAY CHEER.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.697
MERRY--
 HEY, DOOLEY.

04:26.697 --> 04:28.639
( yells )

04:29.800 --> 04:33.043
CODE RED. TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.
EVERYBODY, HIDE.

04:33.043 --> 04:35.646
LEO.

04:35.646 --> 04:38.849
HI.
 I'M WITH HIM, I'LL
BE BEHIND THE TREE.

04:38.849 --> 04:41.412
DON.

04:41.412 --> 04:43.814
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT I RAN INTO SOME
CAR TROUBLE

04:43.814 --> 04:46.817
WHILE DOING ONE
OF MY FAVORITE
YULETIDE TRADITIONS.

04:46.817 --> 04:49.820
OH, WERE YOU DRIVING AROUND
LOOKING AT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?

04:49.820 --> 04:54.765
NO. I WAS TEARING
THROUGH PUDDLES TRYING
TO SPLASH CAROLERS.

04:54.765 --> 04:58.799
TOOK A CORNER TOO FAST
AND ACCIDENTALLY RAN OVER
SOME OF YOUR DECORATIONS.

05:02.873 --> 05:04.775
HO-HO-HO,
HERE YOU GO.

05:06.877 --> 05:10.010
NICE AIM.
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING,
A TRACTOR?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.883
I'M STUCK. I POPPED
A TIRE AND I CAN'T
GET ANY CELL PHONE

05:12.883 --> 05:15.686
SERVICE UP HERE
ON RICH MAN MOUNTAIN.

05:15.686 --> 05:19.590
UH, WE LIKE TO CALL IT
BILLIONAIRE BUTTE ACTUALLY.
THERE'S A HISTORY--

05:19.590 --> 05:21.051
STOP TALKING,
I'M ON THE PHONE.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.626
JOSE, TERRY PERRY.

05:25.626 --> 05:29.059
UH, YEAH, HAD ANOTHER ACCIDENT.
I'M GONNA NEED A TOW.

05:29.059 --> 05:32.062
NO, THE CAT WASN'T
DRIVING THIS TIME.

05:33.764 --> 05:36.507
UH-HUH.
OOH, COCOA.

05:36.507 --> 05:38.609
( laughing )

05:38.609 --> 05:41.111
WHAT?
UGH, GREAT.

05:41.111 --> 05:43.944
( sighing )
THERE'S ONLY ONE
DRIVER TONIGHT

05:43.944 --> 05:45.516
AND THERE'S 30 PEOPLE
AHEAD OF ME.

05:45.516 --> 05:48.779
HEY, WELL, I HAVE
A BIKE PUMP.
LET'S SEE IF THAT WORKS.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.451
LEO.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.953
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
WHAT ARE YOUR CHRISTMAS PLANS?

05:52.953 --> 05:56.487
NOT MUCH. JUST ENJOYING MY CATS'
PRODUCTION OF THE NUTCRACKER,

05:56.487 --> 05:58.959
WITH ME AS THE STAGE.
( laughing )

05:58.959 --> 06:03.564
THE SOUNDTRACK COMES
COURTESY OF MY BELLY GROWLS.

06:03.564 --> 06:07.698
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH US.
 NO, SHE'S REALLY NOT.

06:07.698 --> 06:09.740
AH, I COULDN'T...

06:09.740 --> 06:13.544
WITHOUT GRABBING
A FEW THINGS FROM MY CAR.
( laughs )

06:13.544 --> 06:16.477
WHAT CURSE HATH YOU WROUGHT
UPON THIS HOUSE?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.415
OH, GOOD, YOU MADE IT.

06:24.415 --> 06:27.057
UH, DID WE REALLY
JUST RISK OUR LIVES

06:27.057 --> 06:29.520
TO SAVE A GUY
IN A VIKING HELMET?

06:29.520 --> 06:33.023
OH, THIS? THIS
IS MY TV ANTENNA.

06:33.023 --> 06:38.499
WHEN THE ASH CLOUD CLEARS,
I GET GREAT RECEPTION.
ALL TWO ESKIMO CHANNELS.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.601
IS EVERYTHING OKAY HERE?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.773
WELL, THE VOLCANO
REALLY SHOOK THINGS UP.

06:42.773 --> 06:45.836
COMMUNICATIONS ARE DOWN,
AND THE PIZZA GUY
IS FOUR YEARS LATE.

06:46.977 --> 06:49.880
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I'M GOOD.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.843
GREAT. ANOTHER GENIUS
WITH BAD JOKES.

06:52.843 --> 06:55.816
( laughing )
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME.

06:55.816 --> 06:59.490
WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M FINALLY GETTING
TO MEET THE BIONIC

06:59.490 --> 07:01.822
SUPER-HUMANS I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.626
WH-- YOU KNOW OUR SECRET?
OH, GREAT, WE CAME
TO SAVE HIM AND NOW

07:05.626 --> 07:10.100
WE HAVE TO DESTROY HIM.
CHASE, YOU GRAB HIS LEGS,
I'LL GET THE BUCKET.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.734
STOP. HE'S MR. DAVENPORT'S
CHIEF SCIENTIST,

07:13.734 --> 07:14.965
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
ABOUT US.

07:14.965 --> 07:16.937
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.039
WELL, HERE, LET ME,
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

07:19.039 --> 07:23.143
THIS IS MY LAB-SLASH-
BEDROOM-SLASH-KITCHEN

07:23.143 --> 07:26.016
SLASH-
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

07:26.016 --> 07:30.821
WAIT. YOU LIVE
HERE ALL ALONE?

07:30.821 --> 07:33.123
WITH NO BROTHERS?

07:33.123 --> 07:35.826
DOES THIS PLACE
HAVE A GUEST HOUSE?

07:35.826 --> 07:39.459
THIS IS IT. AND I'M,
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

07:39.459 --> 07:44.765
THINGS HAVE REALLY GONE DOWNHILL
SINCE MY HOLOGRAM WIFE LEFT ME.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.466
I'M KIDDING.
( laughing )

07:46.466 --> 07:48.969
WE ACTUALLY GET ALONG GREAT.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.972
ALTHOUGH SHE'S A HOLOGRAM,
SHE'S NOT REALLY THERE FOR ME.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.607
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
A GIANT CRYSTAL BALL.

07:56.607 --> 07:58.679
I'M GONNA ASK IT A QUESTION.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.182
WHEN WILL CHASE START
TO LOOK LIKE A MAN?

08:02.182 --> 08:05.055
UH, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

08:05.055 --> 08:08.218
IT'S A GAMMA-SPHERE.
IT'S A CONTAINMENT VESSEL
FOR THE MOST POWERFUL

08:08.218 --> 08:10.791
ENERGY KNOWN TO MAN,
GAMMA RAYS.

08:10.791 --> 08:14.565
IF WE COULD HARNESS THESE,
WE COULD SOLVE THE WORLD'S
ENERGY PROBLEMS.

08:14.565 --> 08:17.067
DAVENPORT AND I HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.799
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.972
I WAS TRYING TO DEVELOP
A GAMMA-SPHERE
FOR MR. DAVENPORT.

08:21.972 --> 08:26.637
WELL, I GUESS I BEAT
YOU TO IT, LITTLE GUY.

08:26.637 --> 08:28.979
BUT DON'T FEEL BAD.
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

08:28.979 --> 08:33.683
IN FACT, IF THEY GAVE
OUT MEDALS FOR TRYING,
YOU WOULD HAVE A GOLD.

08:35.044 --> 08:37.918
ARE YOU PATRONIZING ME?
 ( laughing )

08:37.918 --> 08:41.251
IT'S PATRONIZING.
 AND YES.

08:41.251 --> 08:44.695
YOU DO REALIZE I'M
THE SMARTEST PERSON
ON THE PLANET?

08:44.695 --> 08:46.697
( grunting )
AND EVERY TIME YOU
HAVE TO SAY IT,

08:46.697 --> 08:48.699
IT DIMINISHES IT
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

08:48.699 --> 08:51.101
( laughing )
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?

08:51.101 --> 08:54.104
OH, I CAN'T LOOK AWAY.

08:54.104 --> 08:56.907
LUCKILY, THE SPHERE WASN'T
DAMAGED DURING THE ERUPTION.

08:56.907 --> 09:01.612
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
CRACK COULD HAVE HAD
CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES.

09:01.612 --> 09:03.243
LIKE WHAT?
 THE GAMMA RAYS

09:03.243 --> 09:05.045
WOULD HAVE BLOWN
A HOLE IN THE ATMOSPHERE

09:05.045 --> 09:07.618
AND WIPED OUT 20%
OF THE POPULATION.

09:07.618 --> 09:10.681
WELL, THAT IS
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES:
RISKING THE FATE

09:10.681 --> 09:13.854
OF MANKIND SINCE 1992.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.956
COME ON, DR. EVANS,
WE GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

09:15.956 --> 09:19.089
WHOA, I CAN'T LEAVE
UNTIL I'VE STABILIZED
A FEW THINGS.

09:19.089 --> 09:20.961
IF YOU'LL ALL HELP ME,
THIS WON'T TAKE VERY LONG.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.995
OH. OH, IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
BECAUSE I'M SMART.

09:24.995 --> 09:26.967
YOU SAID IT AGAIN.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.844
( sighing )

09:33.844 --> 09:36.006
THAT'S "A FEW THINGS?"

09:36.006 --> 09:38.979
I KEEP MY CAR STOCKED WITH
SUPPLIES IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.952
OR IF I'M JUST TOO TIRED
TO WALK TO THE HOUSE.

09:41.952 --> 09:43.784
OOPS, ONE MORE THING.

09:46.256 --> 09:47.317
( meows )

09:47.317 --> 09:50.621
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.
YOU BROUGHT YOUR CAT.

09:50.621 --> 09:52.262
NO.

09:54.224 --> 09:56.927
I BROUGHT MY CATS.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.702
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SCRATCH, THUMPER,
BOOM-BOOM, MR. WHISKERS,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.273
DINGLE, AND WIDGET
ARE EVEN HERE.

10:03.273 --> 10:05.175
THEY'LL SLEEP WITH ME
INSIDE THE TENT.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.978
THEY FORM A LIVING BLANKET
AROUND MAMA.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.881
UH, TENT?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.918
I DON'T SLEEP ON
OTHER PEOPLE'S BED LINENS.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.850
AND, NO OFFENSE,
DOOLEY-DAVENPORTS,

10:19.850 --> 10:21.722
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN.

10:25.195 --> 10:27.097
OH, THANKS FOR
LENDING A HAND, GUYS.

10:27.097 --> 10:31.031
NO PROBLEM.
GLAD WE COULD HELP.
'CAUSE YOU NEEDED IT.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.805
YEP, BRILLIANT
SCIENTIST RESCUED
BY A 15-YEAR-OLD.

10:34.805 --> 10:37.067
YOU, SIR, ARE WELCOME.

10:39.309 --> 10:42.072
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
AROUND PEOPLE FOR A WHILE,

10:42.072 --> 10:44.745
BUT HE'S REALLY ANNOYING.

10:46.016 --> 10:49.019
YEAH, IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL
OF ALL HIS ABILITIES.

10:49.019 --> 10:52.753
( rumbling sound )

10:52.753 --> 10:54.184
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

10:54.184 --> 10:57.127
OH, UH, YOU REMEMBER
THAT QUESTIONABLE
MEATBALL SANDWICH

10:57.127 --> 10:59.129
I HAD AT THE GAS STATION?

10:59.129 --> 11:01.191
QUESTION'S BEEN ANSWERED.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.965
NO, THAT SOUNDED
LIKE AN AFTERSHOCK.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.998
AFTERSHOCK.
BRACE YOURSELVES.

11:07.998 --> 11:12.202
( rumbling continues )

11:12.202 --> 11:13.904
( alarm sounding )

11:13.904 --> 11:15.976
OKAY, THAT WAS
NOT THE MEATBALLS.

11:17.748 --> 11:22.052
UH, DR. EVANS.

11:22.052 --> 11:25.685
( gasping ) OH, NO.
THERE'S A CRACK
IN THE GAMMA-SPHERE.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.457
OH, MAN,
THAT LOOKS DANGEROUS.

11:27.457 --> 11:29.119
WELL, WE'RE GONNA BOUNCE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.773
WHOA, DON'T GET TOO CLOSE.
IF THAT CRACK OPENS UP,

11:42.773 --> 11:44.434
THOSE GAMMA RAYS'LL
MIX WITH THE ASH CLOUD,

11:44.434 --> 11:46.937
AND SAY GOOD-BYE,
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.

11:46.937 --> 11:49.109
CAN WE PATCH THE CRACK?

11:49.109 --> 11:51.441
PATCH THE CRACK?

11:51.441 --> 11:55.746
BILLION-DOLLAR TECHNOLOGY,
UNSTABLE ENERGY SOURCE.

11:55.746 --> 12:00.050
SURE, LET'S PUT A LITTLE
CHEWING GUM IN THERE
AND SEE IF THAT WORKS.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.993
STARTING TO SEE WHY
THE HOLOGRAM WIFE LEFT.

12:04.154 --> 12:06.757
HEY, HOW ABOUT I SHOOT
MY HEAT VISION AT IT?

12:06.757 --> 12:10.160
WELL, HOW WOULD
THAT HELP?
 I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S WHAT I DO.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.002
( crackling sound )

12:12.002 --> 12:16.106
WHOA. THE MORE OXYGEN
THAT GETS IN THAT CRACK,
THE WORSE THIS IS GONNA GET.

12:16.106 --> 12:20.070
WAIT. MAYBE I CAN
TEMPORARILY CONTAIN
IT WITH MY FORCE FIELD.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.943
GREAT. AND I'LL
COME UP WITH A MORE
PERMANENT SOLUTION.

12:22.943 --> 12:28.078
( zapping sound )

12:28.078 --> 12:31.321
WELL, UH, YOU SEEM BUSY,
SO I'M GONNA GO WATCH TV.

12:31.321 --> 12:34.955
WHAT DO YOU, UH, RECOMMEND,
ESKIMO ONE OR TWO?

12:39.259 --> 12:42.492
( sighing )

12:42.492 --> 12:45.095
SORRY WE DON'T HAVE
A STOCKING FOR YOU.

12:45.095 --> 12:46.396
( gasping )
I GOT IT.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.174
MAKE SURE YOU
PUSH THE CANDY WAY
DOWN IN THERE

12:54.174 --> 12:56.006
SO IT FILLS UP
MY TOOTSIES.

12:58.008 --> 13:01.411
I'M GONNA GO SQUEEZE
INTO MY CHRISTMAS JAMMIES.
( squeals )

13:04.985 --> 13:07.087
OKAY, WE HAVE GOT
TO GET RID OF HER.

13:07.087 --> 13:10.390
I AGREE, BUT ALL MY PLANS
END WITH US GOING TO JAIL.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.462
( grunting, cats meowing )

13:27.978 --> 13:33.083
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

13:33.083 --> 13:34.915
MY CHRISTMAS PJS.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.488
WANT TO SEE ME BELLY DANCE
FROSTY THE SNOWMAN?

13:38.488 --> 13:41.451
NO. NO.
( yelling )

13:43.393 --> 13:46.126
THE GAMMA RAYS ARE MELTING
A HOLE IN MY FORCE FIELD.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.258
I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH LONGER I'LL BE
ABLE TO CONTAIN IT.

13:48.258 --> 13:51.301
UH, YOU HAVE TO,
I DON'T HAVE A FIX YET.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.003
SHOCKING.

13:53.003 --> 13:55.936
WHAT, SO WHEN THESE
GAMMA RAYS HIT,
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH GONERS.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.068
WELL, WE'LL BE.
BUT YOU SHOULD BE FINE,

13:58.068 --> 13:59.339
SINCE YOUR HEAD
IS FULL OF LEAD.

14:01.211 --> 14:04.244
HA. YES. LEAD.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.877
HEY, DR. SMARTY,
WE JUST MET.

14:06.877 --> 14:08.848
YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT PRIVILEGE YET.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.522
NO. LEAD CAN CONTAIN
THE GAMMA RAYS.

14:12.522 --> 14:16.356
EXACTLY. AND DAVENPORT MADE
THIS BUILDING OUT OF LEAD

14:16.356 --> 14:19.089
TO KEEP EVERYBODY FROM SPYING
ON HIS SECRET TECHNOLOGY.

14:19.089 --> 14:21.631
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS RIG
ENOUGH EXPLOSIVES TO...

14:21.631 --> 14:23.633
IMPLODE ON
THE GAMMA-SPHERE.

14:23.633 --> 14:28.038
GREAT IDEA.
 BLOWING STUFF UP
ON CHRISTMAS.

14:28.038 --> 14:30.600
IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL
TIME OF THE YEAR.

14:34.204 --> 14:38.508
( loud snoring )

14:38.508 --> 14:41.881
( talking loudly )
THANK YOU FOR
THE SCARF, DONALD.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.215
WHAT?
 I SAID THANK YOU,
FOR THE SCARF.

14:45.215 --> 14:46.616
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.961
SO, UH, LEO.

14:50.961 --> 14:53.393
( snoring stops )

14:53.393 --> 14:55.365
WHAT'D YOU GET?

14:55.365 --> 14:58.398
I GOT SOCKS.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.102
WET SOCKS.
OH. THAT HAVE BEEN
MARKED BY A CAT.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.174
OKAY.

15:06.977 --> 15:09.139
( phone ringing )

15:09.139 --> 15:13.483
OH, NO. GRANDMA'S SNOWED IN.
SHE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

15:13.483 --> 15:19.089
GREAT. SO, NO ADAM,
NO BREE, NO CHASE,
AND NO GRANDMA TURKEY?

15:19.089 --> 15:21.691
HOW MUCH WORSE
CAN THIS GET?

15:21.691 --> 15:24.224
( groaning )

15:24.224 --> 15:26.596
( yawning )

15:29.529 --> 15:31.331
AND THERE'S MY ANSWER.

15:35.205 --> 15:38.038
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
PRINCIPAL PERRY.
I HOPE YOU SLEPT WELL.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.669
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.445
OOH, SANTA CAME.
WHAT'D I GET?
WHAT'D I GET?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.617
( yelling )
( ripping sound )

15:47.617 --> 15:50.480
HOPEFULLY, SOME NEW PJS,
'CAUSE THOSE JUST RIPPED.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.155
UM, NO ONE GOT YOU--
 OOH, UH,

15:55.155 --> 15:57.027
OF COURSE
WE GOT YOU SOMETHING.

15:57.027 --> 16:00.530
IT'S CHRISTMAS. YOU CAN'T NOT
GET A GIFT ON CHRISTMAS.

16:00.530 --> 16:02.462
( chuckling )
IT WOULD BE RUDE.

16:04.995 --> 16:08.468
HERE YOU GO,
PRINCIPAL PERRY.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.101
( yelling excitedly )

16:11.101 --> 16:15.975
( gasping )
A QHT VIDEO GAME SYSTEM.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.279
I CAN EXCHANGE THIS
FOR A NICE BLOUSE
AND TWO PAIRS OF SLACKS.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.252
THE GOOD KIND THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE TO IRON. OR WASH.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.656
BUT I ASKED FOR A QHT.

16:27.617 --> 16:30.020
WORST CHRISTMAS EVER.

16:30.020 --> 16:33.363
OOH, SOMEBODY NEEDS A NAP.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.567
DID HE LIKE THE SOCKS?

16:40.600 --> 16:43.033
♪ DECK THE HALLS
WITH LARGE EXPLOSIVES ♪

16:43.033 --> 16:45.305
♪ BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM
BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM ♪

16:45.305 --> 16:47.137
OKAY.

16:47.137 --> 16:49.309
CHARGES ARE SET.
SO NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO

16:49.309 --> 16:51.641
IS LIGHT THIS FUSE
TO START THE IMPLOSION.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.343
WE'LL ONLY HAVE
15 SECONDS TO GET OUT

16:53.343 --> 16:55.245
OF THE BLAST ZONE
ONCE THE FUSE IS LIT.

16:55.245 --> 16:57.587
OOF. THINK WE'LL
MAKE IT OUT IN TIME?

16:57.587 --> 17:00.190
I KNOW I WILL.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.622
OKAY, ADAM,
LIGHT THE FUSE.
 RIGHT.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.500
( powering down sound )

17:12.502 --> 17:13.663
LET'S GO.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.069
OH. THESE RAYS,
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.171
ALTHOUGH, I REALLY THOUGHT
THEY'D BE A LOT MORE BLINDING.

17:21.171 --> 17:23.242
AH, THERE'S THE BURN.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.773
Bree:
COME ON.

17:28.078 --> 17:30.049
( explosions going off )

17:33.123 --> 17:34.184
DID IT WORK?

17:34.184 --> 17:36.386
I STILL CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.328
DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL WEAR OFF.

17:38.328 --> 17:39.489
WE GOTTA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

17:39.489 --> 17:42.061
ADAM, WHERE DID
YOU PARK THE TRANSPORT?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.164
IN THE GARAGE UNDER FACILITY X.

17:45.535 --> 17:48.738
( frustrated groans )

17:48.738 --> 17:51.701
ALL RIGHT.
DR. EVANS,
HOP ON, YOU'RE FIRST.

17:53.143 --> 17:54.404
READY WHEN YOU ARE,
MISSY.
 WHAT-- NO. GET--

17:54.404 --> 17:55.445
( grunting )
GET--

17:55.445 --> 17:57.107
GET OFF ME.

17:57.107 --> 17:59.349
SHE'S A FEISTY
LITTLE THING,
ISN'T SHE?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.484
YOU KNOW,
AFTER SPENDING TIME
WITH PERRY,

18:04.484 --> 18:07.717
THE GRINCH DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE SUCH A BAD GUY.

18:07.717 --> 18:12.792
YEAH, AT LEAST AFTER
HE TOOK EVERYONE'S
PRESENTS HE WENT HOME.
 MM-HMM.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.225
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING DOWN HERE?

18:15.225 --> 18:18.868
SAME THING I DO AT SCHOOL.
HIDING FROM PRINCIPAL PERRY.

18:18.868 --> 18:21.231
LEO, SHE IS OUR GUEST.
IT IS RUDE

18:21.231 --> 18:23.173
TO LEAVE HER UPSTAIRS
BY HERSELF.

18:23.173 --> 18:26.105
SO GET UP THERE AND LET US
KNOW WHEN SHE'S GONE.
 YEAH.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.341
OH.
 YOU'RE BACK.

18:31.341 --> 18:33.783
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

18:33.783 --> 18:34.784
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

18:34.784 --> 18:36.786
( all laughing )

18:36.786 --> 18:39.789
SO, HOW'D
THE MISSION GO?

18:39.789 --> 18:42.492
YES.

18:42.492 --> 18:44.454
WELL, HOW'S MY
RESEARCH FACILITY?

18:44.454 --> 18:45.455
( laughing )

18:45.455 --> 18:48.428
OH, YOU WOULDN'T
EVEN RECOGNIZE IT.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.899
OH.

18:49.899 --> 18:53.463
HEY, WHY ARE WE DOWN
HERE WHEN THE
PRESENTS ARE UPSTAIRS?

18:53.463 --> 18:55.735
HEY, WAIT, WAIT.
NOT SO FAST. UM...

18:55.735 --> 19:00.440
PRINCIPAL PERRY IS UPSTAIRS.
I REPEAT, PERRY IS IN THE HOUSE.

19:02.312 --> 19:03.743
YOU KNOW,
I AM VERY TIRED.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.844
YEAH, I COULD
USE SOME SLEEP.
 SEE YOU IN THE NEW YEAR.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.247
FREEZE.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.879
LOOK, THE POOR WOMAN
IS ALL ALONE,
AND IT'S CHRISTMAS.

19:09.879 --> 19:11.181
HEY, AT LEAST
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

19:11.181 --> 19:13.353
SO, LET'S MAKE
THE BEST OF IT, RIGHT?

19:13.353 --> 19:17.757
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.630
WE ARE GOING TO MARCH
UP THERE RIGHT NOW
AND TELL THIS WOMAN,

19:20.630 --> 19:22.832
VAMOOSE, LADY.
THIS IS OUR CHRISTMAS.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.294
( all cheering )

19:24.294 --> 19:27.237
WAIT, SHE CAN'T SEE US
IN OUR MISSION SUITS.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.639
WELL, HURRY UP AND CHANGE,
I'M NOT TELLING HER
WITHOUT BACKUP.

19:31.871 --> 19:35.245
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
WE-- UH, SMELL FOOD.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.947
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:37.947 --> 19:40.179
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?
I'M MAKING DINNER.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.811
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.
GET OUT.

19:43.653 --> 19:46.416
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
THIS IS AMAZING.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.318
WELL, I DIDN'T SEE YOU
COOKING ANYTHING.

19:50.420 --> 19:54.324
WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING NICE.

19:54.324 --> 19:56.826
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.

19:56.826 --> 19:58.828
AH, IT'S NOTHING.
I FIGURED,

19:58.828 --> 20:01.271
I CRASHED YOUR HOLIDAY,
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

20:01.271 --> 20:03.873
OH, LOOK, HOW FANCY.

20:03.873 --> 20:05.975
SHE MADE
A CHRISTMAS GOOSE.
 OH.

20:05.975 --> 20:09.539
IT'S ACTUALLY A SWAN FROM
THE POND DOWN THE STREET.

20:09.539 --> 20:13.343
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
WALK RIGHT UP TO 'EM.

20:13.343 --> 20:14.684
( cat meowing )

20:14.684 --> 20:16.746
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S NOT
COMING FROM THE OVEN.

20:17.847 --> 20:19.449
I GOT IT.

20:19.449 --> 20:22.392
THE CHRISTMAS TREE
IS ONE BIG SCRATCHING
POST FOR THOSE CATS.

20:23.753 --> 20:25.995
( cats meowing )

20:25.995 --> 20:28.898
OOH, COME ON, DINGLE.
COME ON, BOY.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.000
OH, HE'S USUALLY
VERY, VERY GOOD.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.232
Principal Perry:
COME ON, DINGLE.
COME ON.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.365
HE'S GETTING REALLY FEISTY NOW.
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

20:35.365 --> 20:37.337
WE'RE GUESTS, DINGLE.
WE'RE GUESTS.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.838
COME ON, DINGLE.
COME ON.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.841
( cat screeches )
 GET OUT OF HERE.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.743
( grunting )

20:43.743 --> 20:49.449
( yelling )

21:00.430 --> 21:02.892
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS MEAL.

21:02.892 --> 21:05.465
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.298
I'LL TAKE THAT
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.441
WHAT'S THIS?

21:11.441 --> 21:14.474
UH, YOUR BILL.

21:14.474 --> 21:18.978
I SEE YOU INCLUDED TAX, TIP,
AND THE COST OF A NEW TIRE.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.312
SORRY, GRATUITY IS INCLUDED
FOR PARTIES OF SIX OR MORE.

21:22.312 --> 21:23.683
I HAVE NO SAY IN THAT.

21:26.055 --> 21:29.359
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA
CHARGE US FOR DINNER?
 WELL,

21:29.359 --> 21:30.890
I DIDN'T MAKE
THIS MEAL WITH LOVE.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.963
I MADE IT WITH SKILL,
SWEAT, AND WHATEVER
CAME OFF THE TIP

21:33.963 --> 21:35.895
OF MY PINKY WHEN I WAS
CHOPPING THE VEGGIES.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.467
( groaning )

21:37.467 --> 21:39.499
( coughing )
