11:33.125 --> 11:35.167
HA HA HA HA.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.792
Eddy:
OH, ED.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.417
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HUH?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.792
Edd: I'M SURROUNDED
BY IDIOTS.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.083
COOL.

11:42.167 --> 11:43.667
IT IS SO FLAT.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.167
A WALL, EDDY?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.500
CERTAINLY YOU JEST.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.875
YOU WANT TO SEE
MY BROTHER'S ROOM?

11:51.958 --> 11:53.542
YOUR BROTHER'S ROOM?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.125
EVERY MAN
FOR HIMSELF!

11:55.208 --> 11:56.333
Eddy: HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE!

11:56.417 --> 11:59.042
WHO GAVE YOU
PERMISSION TO
TOUCH HIS DOOR?

11:59.125 --> 12:00.125
NOBODY.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.333
THAT'S RIGHT,
ED.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.458
HAVE A SEAT.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.708
RELAX.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.333
MAYBE I CAN TRIM
YOUR TOENAILS
OR SOMETHING.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.292
OH, BE STILL MY HEART.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.167
AAH!

12:09.250 --> 12:10.333
NOW THEN.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.833
IF YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
IN MY BROTHER'S ROOM,

12:12.917 --> 12:14.042
I'LL--
Edd: EDDY?

12:14.125 --> 12:18.667
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE WE ENTER
THIS OUTPOURING OF RESISTANCE?

12:18.750 --> 12:19.875
NO PROBLEM.

12:19.958 --> 12:22.000
I GOT A KEY.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.000
COME ON IN, BOYS.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.083
CHECK IT OUT.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.500
Ed: YOUR BROTHER'S ROOM
IS COOL, EDDY!

12:32.583 --> 12:34.833
Eddy: MY BROTHER
IS THE COOLEST, ED.

12:34.917 --> 12:38.417
Edd: YES, WELL,
IN SOME CIRCLES,
I'M SURE.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.125
SHALL WE THROW CAUTION
TO THE WIND

12:41.208 --> 12:42.875
AND ENTER THIS LAIR OF--

12:42.958 --> 12:43.917
WATCH IT!

12:44.000 --> 12:46.708
MY BROTHER WAS A WHIZ
AT BOOBY TRAPS.

12:46.792 --> 12:47.417
HA HA HA.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.625
BUT, EDDY,
THE SAFE!

12:48.708 --> 12:50.917
I ALREADY CHECKED IT,
DOUBLE D.

12:51.000 --> 12:51.792
IT'S EMPTY.

12:51.875 --> 12:52.750
Edd: YEOW!

12:52.833 --> 12:55.458
CAN'T YOU JUST
SMELL HIS GREATNESS?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.458
I THINK
THAT IS ME, EDDY.

12:57.542 --> 12:58.917
Eddy: LOOK AT THIS!

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
AIN'T SHE A BEAUT?

13:00.083 --> 13:01.333
[PURRS]

13:01.417 --> 13:04.000
MY BROTHER SAID
I COULD HAVE IT
WHEN I TURN 14.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.750
NOT THAT IT'S OUT OF
PLACE IN THIS DEN OF
DISHEVELMENT,

13:07.833 --> 13:09.292
BUT WHY IS THERE
A VEHICLE

13:09.375 --> 13:11.167
SITTING IN YOUR
BROTHER'S BEDROOM?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.083
HE KEEPS HIS SNAKE
IN THE TRUNK.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.292
HUH. THE LITTLE WEASEL
MUST HAVE ESCAPED AGAIN.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.000
ESCAPED?

13:18.083 --> 13:20.583
OH DEAR, OH DEAR, OH--

13:21.292 --> 13:22.667
HEY,
WATCH THE CAMEL!

13:22.750 --> 13:23.833
I SAID
NO TOUCHING.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.750
I WISH I HAD
A ROOM LIKE THIS.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.792
AH-CHOO!

13:28.875 --> 13:29.750
DUST.

13:29.833 --> 13:30.917
FROM A CAMEL.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.500
WHO KNOWS WHERE
THAT THING HAS
WALLOWED.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.208
AIR.
I NEED AIR!

13:38.792 --> 13:39.833
HA HA!

13:39.917 --> 13:41.417
MY BROTHER
WAS A WHIZ AT
LAYING BRICKS.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.750
HEY, LUMPY.
DID YOU CATCH
THAT ONE?

13:43.833 --> 13:46.208
ED! GET AWAY
FROM THERE!

13:47.292 --> 13:48.375
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

13:48.458 --> 13:52.208
DON'T TOUCH ANY OF
MY BROTHER'S STUFF, ED.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.958
EVER THOUGHT OF RENTIN'
OUT THAT EMPTY SPACE
YOU CALL A HEAD?

13:57.042 --> 13:58.792
OH, LOOK AT
THE TIME.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.208
GOT TO GO.
TA TA.

14:00.042 --> 14:01.500
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:01.583 --> 14:05.917
DID I TELL YOU MY BROTHER
WAS A WHIZ AT CHEWIN'
ICE CUBES?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.083
Ed: COOL.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.583
OH.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.583
AH--

14:12.667 --> 14:15.167
AH-CHOO!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.083
PLEASE, EDDY.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.083
I'M SURE YOUR BROTHER
WAS A MULTIFACETED
INDIVIDUAL,

14:20.167 --> 14:22.208
BUT I--

14:26.625 --> 14:27.917
[GASPING]

14:28.000 --> 14:28.792
DID IT DENT?

14:28.875 --> 14:30.125
I WILL GET IT, EDDY.

14:30.208 --> 14:33.292
NICE AND SOFT,
LIKE A KITTEN.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.583
ED! GET YOUR SLOBBERING MOUTH
OFF MY BROTHER'S TROPHY!

14:37.667 --> 14:39.000
OH! OH!

14:39.083 --> 14:41.583
OK, THAT'S IT.
I PROTEST.

14:41.667 --> 14:45.042
LET GO, YOU PATHETIC
EXCUSE FOR A LUMP!

14:45.125 --> 14:46.208
OH!

14:46.042 --> 14:47.042
LET GO!

14:47.125 --> 14:49.042
ED!

14:49.125 --> 14:52.000
I'VE TRULY HAD
ENOUGH OF--

14:57.750 --> 15:01.167
READ TO ME WHAT IS ON
THE PRETTY PAPER,
DOUBLE D.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.708
FORGET THE STUPID PAPER!

15:02.792 --> 15:05.542
FIND ME SOME
STUPID TAPE.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.792
WHY, I DO BELIEVE
THIS IS A MAP.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.458
LET ME SEE
THAT THING.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.500
IT'S A MAP TO
MY BROTHER'S
SECRET STASH!

15:14.583 --> 15:18.083
WE'RE GOING TO BE RICH!
SWIMMIN' IN MOOLAH!
ROLLIN' IN HAY!

15:18.167 --> 15:19.750
UH...

15:20.375 --> 15:21.583
I THINK
IT'S IN GREEK.

15:21.667 --> 15:24.625
MY BROTHER WAS A WHIZ
AT BAZUKI PLAYING.

15:24.708 --> 15:25.667
YES, WELL.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.833
IT APPEARS TO BE
SOME FORM OF ENCODING.

15:27.917 --> 15:30.083
LET'S DRY IT OUT
AT MY HOUSE.

15:30.167 --> 15:31.375
MY MOM HAS A STOVE.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.208
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, ED?

15:33.292 --> 15:34.542
MY STOVE'LL WORK FINE.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.125
OH, PLEASE.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.083
THE STRANGE THING IS
ALL TREASURE MAPS
HAVE SOME INDICATION

15:38.167 --> 15:39.333
AS TO ITS LOCATION.

15:39.417 --> 15:41.042
A STAR, AN "X,"
A CROSS.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.792
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING HERE.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.792
IT'S BAFFLING.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.333
DO YOU SEE ONE HERE,
BECAUSE I DON'T.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.208
THIS REQUIRES
CAREFUL STUDYING

15:48.292 --> 15:51.708
AND CAN ONLY BE
SOLVED BY INGENUITY
AND PATIENT EFFORT.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.000
MEET ME AT MY HOUSE
IN ONE HOUR.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.083
ONE HOUR?

15:55.167 --> 15:57.833
AND I'LL HAVE YOUR
ANSWER TO OUR DESTINY.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.083
GENTLEMEN.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.208
GREAT.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.000
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO
FOR AN HOUR?

16:03.083 --> 16:05.000
I'VE GOT AN ELASTIC,
EDDY.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.750
BIG DEAL.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.375
[SNAP]
YEOWCH!

16:16.625 --> 16:19.083
WHY DID YOU PUMMEL MY
DOOR WITH A SHOVEL?

16:19.167 --> 16:22.917
SO, WHERE DO WE
START DIGGING,
DOUBLE D?

16:23.458 --> 16:26.125
I CONCEDE TO
YOUR BROTHER'S
INGENUITY.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.958
I COULDN'T
DECIPHER THE MAP.

16:29.042 --> 16:29.958
WHAT?

16:30.042 --> 16:31.167
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.333
I EXHAUSTED
ALL THEOREMS.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.250
ELIMINATED ALL
CONJECTURE.

16:34.333 --> 16:35.458
PONDERED
EVERY VIEWPOINT.

16:35.542 --> 16:38.917
BUT THIS IS ONE MOTHER
OF A TREASURE MAP, EDDY!

16:39.000 --> 16:40.333
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE SMART GUY!

16:40.417 --> 16:43.917
YOU'RE MESSING WITH
OUR GROUP DYNAMIC!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.458
IT'S BEYOND ME,
EDDY.

16:46.542 --> 16:47.958
HE ALWAYS HAD IT
OUT FOR ME.

16:48.042 --> 16:50.167
HE'S DOING THIS
ON PURPOSE,
I TELL YOU!

16:50.250 --> 16:52.458
I NEED THAT TREASURE
BAD, DOUBLE D.

16:52.542 --> 16:53.917
I THINK I JUST THUNK.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.417
WAS THAT ENGLISH,
ED?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.208
HA HA HA.

16:56.292 --> 16:57.583
LET GO OF ME,
FUNNELHEAD.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.458

DOUBLE D.

17:00.542 --> 17:02.292

17:06.042 --> 17:08.208
HMM.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.125
BY JOVE,
HE'S GOT IT.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.583
ED, HOW DID YOU
DO THAT?

17:13.667 --> 17:14.708
BECAUSE I'M A BROTHER,

17:14.792 --> 17:16.583
AND EDDY'S BROTHER
IS A BROTHER,

17:16.667 --> 17:19.125
AND EDDY IS A BROTHER

17:19.208 --> 17:21.167

NICELY PUT, ED.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.917
OH, BROTHER.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.208
NOW, IF I WERE TO
PLACE THIS OVER TOP
OF YOUR BROTHER'S MAP,

17:28.292 --> 17:32.208
THERE MAY BE
A CORRELATION TO THE
AREA OF ITS LOCATION.

17:32.042 --> 17:34.625
HURRY UP.
I'M STARTIN'
TO SEE SPOTS.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.125

17:36.208 --> 17:38.000
OH, NO.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.000
EDDY, ACCORDING
TO MY CALCULATIONS,

17:42.083 --> 17:46.083
YOUR BROTHER'S TREASURE
LIES DEEP WITHIN
THE CONFINES OF...

19:18.583 --> 19:20.833
IF MY INTERPRETATION
OF THE MAP IS CORRECT,

19:20.917 --> 19:24.625
