00:30.250 --> 00:31.500
[preacher] Thank Heaven!

00:32.333 --> 00:35.250
The crisis, the danger, is past...

00:36.250 --> 00:39.750
and the lingering illness is over at last.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
And the fever called "living"
is conquered at last.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.958
Be silent in that solitude,
which is not loneliness.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.750
For then, the spirits of the dead

00:54.208 --> 00:56.625
- who stood in life before thee--

shadowy, shadowy

yet unbroken, is a symbol and a token.

01:15.875 --> 01:19.875
How it hangs upon the trees,
a mystery of mysteries.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.875
The boundaries
which divide life from death

01:23.875 --> 01:27.958

01:42.166 --> 01:43.750

01:43.750 --> 01:44.958
She's here.

01:46.125 --> 01:49.000
[preacher] Our first impulse
is to shrink from the danger.

He wants to meet with you tonight.

02:58.458 --> 02:59.833
- Who?
- Him.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.166
He sent an address. A...

03:02.166 --> 03:04.333
A weird address, but it was actually him.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.625
Not a secretary, not an assistant,
not even the Pym Reaper.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.750
Most expensive in the world.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.166
This bottle
was four million euros at auction.

Aged in barrels for more than 100 years.

And the bottle itself
dipped in 18 karat yellow gold,

05:06.375 --> 05:11.083

05:12.625 --> 05:13.958
You know, a single pour...

05:15.333 --> 05:17.458

See what a few years'

I mean it, Roderick.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.708
It's unimaginable and I am truly sorry--

05:33.708 --> 05:36.958
No, I understand, Auggie.
You're sorry my children are all dead.

05:39.416 --> 05:42.333
Where's Mr. Pym? It's better
we talk with your attorney present.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.916
How many subpoenas have you sent me
over the years?

05:45.625 --> 05:46.625
You finally got me.

05:48.458 --> 05:50.083
You're hung up on protocol.

05:50.666 --> 05:54.083
- Waive it then.
- Fine. I waive my right to an attorney.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.750
Here's to Title 18, Section 371.

06:03.625 --> 06:04.625
Sure.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.750
What's not to celebrate?
You got away with it.

06:08.541 --> 06:10.583
- Again.
- Nobody gets away with anything.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.625
Not really.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.125
[chuckles] Madeline would beg to differ.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.916
You can ask yourself.
She's downstairs in the basement.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.333
Oh, that's right,
she's an even tougher get than me.

06:23.333 --> 06:26.375
Have you ever had her on the record?
I don't think so.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.625
You've never had either of us
on the record.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.083
- Have you?
- [phone vibrates]

06:34.833 --> 06:36.791

06:37.375 --> 06:40.750
- It's my granddaughter, Lenore.
- You can take that if you need to.

the only thing you've ever wanted.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.791
My confession.

07:00.666 --> 07:04.875
This is Assistant U.S. Attorney
C. A. Dupin, sitting with Roderick Usher.

07:05.666 --> 07:08.625
November 20th, 2023.

07:08.625 --> 07:11.375
Mr. Usher has waived his right
to have an attorney present.

07:11.375 --> 07:15.208
And Mr. Dupin has waived a glass
of Henri IV, so which of us is crazier?

07:15.208 --> 07:16.875
Just warming it up.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.583
This is indeed Roderick Usher.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.875
We're in my childhood home.

07:22.708 --> 07:26.208
Yeah, this is where I grew up.
Kept it all these years.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.541
The whole neighborhood...

07:28.083 --> 07:29.083
actually.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.708
So I can watch the paint peel.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.750
The weeds grow.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.208
And smell the rot
if I needed a pick-me-up.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.791
And what exactly are you confessing to?

07:41.750 --> 07:44.750
You mentioned Title 18, Section 371.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.375
- That's defrauding the U.S. government...
- All of it.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.375
- All of it?
- The whole thing.

07:49.958 --> 07:52.791
You brought what, uh, 73 charges?

07:52.791 --> 07:56.916
All of them, everything, all yours.
Right now.

07:58.416 --> 07:59.833
And I'll throw in a...

08:02.250 --> 08:03.250
a bonus.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.833
I'll tell you how my children died.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.041
I know how they died, Roderick.
Everybody knows.

08:16.958 --> 08:20.083
Believe me, Mr. Dupin, when I tell you,
you don't know a thing.

08:21.875 --> 08:22.875
But where to start?

08:24.625 --> 08:26.041
At the beginning, I suppose...

08:29.416 --> 08:30.416
is here...

08:32.041 --> 08:33.166
in this very room.

08:36.791 --> 08:39.166
<i>You cannot understand
the things I've done,</i>

08:39.166 --> 08:42.916
<i>unless you understand the life
that Madeline and I were born into.</i>

08:43.791 --> 08:47.291
<i>And the woman who would shape
every choice we'd ever make.</i>

08:47.833 --> 08:48.958
<i>Our mother.</i>

08:50.041 --> 08:51.041
<i>Eliza.</i>

08:52.666 --> 08:57.000
<i>She was personal secretary
to the CEO of Fortunato Pharmaceuticals.</i>

08:57.000 --> 08:59.416
<i>William Longfellow back then.</i>

09:00.250 --> 09:02.250
<i>A man of appetites.</i>

09:02.250 --> 09:06.166
<i>A man of business,
who once reportedly told his wife...</i>

09:06.166 --> 09:08.750
Children are never too tender
to be whipped.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.541
Like tough beefsteaks,
the more you beat them,

09:12.125 --> 09:13.916
the more tender they become.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.541
[Roderick] <i>For reasons
we were far too young to understand,</i>

09:19.375 --> 09:22.416
<i>we were forbidden to go
anywhere near Longfellow's house.</i>

09:24.041 --> 09:27.166
<i>It was one of our mother's
most insistent rules.</i>

09:27.166 --> 09:31.250
<i>So Madeline being Madeline,
insisted that we break it.</i>

09:44.291 --> 09:46.875
Spy! Climbing my fence!

09:47.458 --> 09:49.916
Not here. Not ever. We agreed.

09:49.916 --> 09:52.708
- [whispers] I'm sorry.
- Let go of her arm.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.833
- [woman] Honey?
- Oh, nothing to worry about.

09:55.833 --> 09:58.458
We've just had a couple of lookie-loos,
that's all.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.625
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
it won't happen again.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.833
Eliza? Is he all right?

10:02.833 --> 10:05.708
- He's fine.
- No harm done. We'll talk about it Monday.

10:05.708 --> 10:09.916
Just make sure those Emory files
are on my desk when I get in.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.125
Of course, Mr. Longfellow.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.333
[Roderick] <i>Madeline hated Longfellow,
even then.</i>

10:14.333 --> 10:16.416
<i>She knew, somehow.</i>

10:16.416 --> 10:18.250
- Madeline.
- [Roderick] <i>She always knew.</i>

10:18.250 --> 10:20.375
[Eliza] We stay away
from Mr. Longfellow's house.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.375
- We were just trying to see...
- [Eliza] You know the rules, Madeline.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.458
Just like God the Father is on high

10:25.458 --> 10:29.875
and loves us from far away,
the same is true for Mr. Longfellow.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.375
He's mean.

10:31.375 --> 10:32.583
He's complicated.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.041
Like God.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.208
- How's your foot?
- It hurts.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.958
Remember what Mother Teresa said,

10:38.958 --> 10:41.666
"Pain and suffering
are like the kiss of Jesus."

10:42.791 --> 10:46.666
It just means you've come so close to him
that he can kiss you.

10:47.541 --> 10:48.375
[kisses]

10:49.041 --> 10:51.916
[Roderick] <i>If pain and suffering
were the kisses of Jesus,</i>

10:51.916 --> 10:54.250
<i>then he kissed the living fuck
out of my mother</i>

10:54.250 --> 10:55.708
<i>in the years that followed.</i>

10:55.708 --> 10:57.791

11:14.500 --> 11:16.000
[Roderick] Okay, Mom, okay.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.583
- [gasps in pain]
- Here. Here.

11:18.583 --> 11:19.875
- No! [grunts]
- [glass shatters]

11:19.875 --> 11:23.083
Mom, you have to drink and...
And we think maybe...

11:23.750 --> 11:25.666
Maybe we need to call a doctor,
like on the TV.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.708
- [Eliza] No!
- [Roderick] Mom, please.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.250
Jesus showed us

11:29.250 --> 11:31.958
how to heal the sick,
and it wasn't through medicine!

11:32.541 --> 11:34.041
Where is your faith?

11:34.666 --> 11:37.708
Your body is a temple of God.

11:37.708 --> 11:38.916
And you'd pollute it?!

11:39.875 --> 11:42.041
[groaning]

11:42.041 --> 11:44.833
Don't say what you want,
say what makes him say what you want.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.333
That way it's his idea.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.333
Mom said we're not supposed
to ever bother him. Him especially.

11:49.333 --> 11:53.291
Trust me, it's the least he can do.
Okay, now let's go over it one more time.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.625
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Longfellow,
but since she worked for you

11:56.625 --> 12:00.125
so well for so long, almost 20 years,
we thought you would want to know...

12:00.125 --> 12:01.541
[Roderick] She's getting worse.

12:01.541 --> 12:04.416
And we know that you're...
You're so good at helping people.

12:04.416 --> 12:05.333
[chuckles]

12:05.333 --> 12:08.291
[Roderick] She always said you were a man
that could move mountains,

12:08.291 --> 12:09.541
talk anyone into anything.

12:09.541 --> 12:11.583
You were the smartest man she ever met.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.625
Uh, we're here to ask you,
maybe you have an idea.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.708
Maybe you could talk her into it.

12:17.708 --> 12:20.750
I'm sorry, you're here at my home

12:21.416 --> 12:24.250
so I'll talk your mother
into seeing a doctor?

12:24.250 --> 12:26.666
She won't take any medicine. Nothing.

12:26.666 --> 12:29.541
Won't see any doctors.
And she's in so much pain.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.416
[Roderick] We thought
if you could help her,

12:31.416 --> 12:33.791
if you told her what she needs to do,
she might listen.

12:33.791 --> 12:35.916
She won't listen to us. But you, she...

12:37.458 --> 12:38.833
I mean...

12:38.833 --> 12:39.916
She loves you.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.791
- What did you say?
- It's the least you could do. For her.

12:45.541 --> 12:46.500
For us.

12:47.291 --> 12:51.375
I don't know what you're talking about.
No idea, okay?

12:51.375 --> 12:57.791
Eliza was a decent worker for a long time,
but she lost it. Didn't she?

12:57.791 --> 13:02.291
Now take your insinuations,
your fucking false insinuations,

13:02.291 --> 13:06.250
take your grift and get off my property.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.125
[woman] Are those...

13:16.416 --> 13:17.708
Are those Eliza's kids?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
What do we do?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
We know what she wouldn't want us to do.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.583
If we call someone that means police.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.041
- Doctors, they'll embalm her.
- They can't.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.125
[Madeline] I know.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.208

16:25.041 --> 16:26.750
- [Roderick] Mom!
- [Madeline] Mommy!

16:27.708 --> 16:28.708
[Roderick] Mommy!

16:50.791 --> 16:53.666
I mean, she's probably
passed out somewhere, right?

16:53.666 --> 16:57.000
She had to crawl up, break out,
she probably just passed right out.

16:57.000 --> 16:57.958
Jesus.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.916
- What do we do?
- Call a doctor.

16:59.916 --> 17:02.500
We've got to call!
I don't care what she says.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.083
It was an accident. They got to know
we didn't mean to...

17:13.500 --> 17:15.416
[whimpering]

17:20.000 --> 17:21.750
[breathing heavily]

17:21.750 --> 17:22.791
[choking]

17:23.333 --> 17:24.791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.708
- We didn't know.
- We're sorry. Please, Mommy.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.958
[exhales]

17:37.791 --> 17:39.791
[breathing heavily]

17:42.291 --> 17:44.291
[menacing music playing]

17:45.375 --> 17:47.083
[both breathing heavily]

18:11.875 --> 18:14.958
No, the whole street's out,
it's not just us!

18:25.625 --> 18:26.583
Who is that?

18:28.083 --> 18:29.291
What are you doing here?

18:34.458 --> 18:35.666
Oh, my God.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.083
[screams]

18:41.083 --> 18:42.416
Mom!

18:53.958 --> 18:54.958
William!

19:00.208 --> 19:02.041
[woman] William!

19:02.041 --> 19:04.250
[shivering]

19:06.000 --> 19:07.875
[woman] William!

19:11.833 --> 19:14.916
The official story was Longfellow
had a heart attack in his sleep.

19:14.916 --> 19:17.791
That was before the Internet.
Prehistoric times.

19:17.791 --> 19:21.041
The nastiest bits we cleaned up
after I took over the company.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.083
To spare the family any embarrassment.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.458
I mean, my family, the Usher family.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.500
The last thing my mother did in this life...

19:30.875 --> 19:32.500
was kill a powerful man.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.958
And we carried that secret with us,
and loved her all the more.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.333
She was...

19:40.958 --> 19:42.291
remarkable.

19:44.958 --> 19:48.916
Why are you telling me this?
Why are we talking about your mother?

19:50.166 --> 19:54.583
Oh, I assume that I'm supposed to
because she's here.

19:56.750 --> 19:57.875
What do you mean?

19:59.250 --> 20:00.416
She's right behind you.

20:05.708 --> 20:07.083
[inhales deeply]

20:07.083 --> 20:13.000
You know, I read somewhere
about high-powered negotiation tactics.

20:13.791 --> 20:16.791
How some truly brilliant business people

20:16.791 --> 20:20.500
will plant these moments
into high-stakes conversations.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.125
Force a reaction, no matter how trivial.

20:23.125 --> 20:26.500
Talk softly to make an adversary lean in.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.916
Make them repeat themselves.
Throw your eyeline behind them.

20:31.708 --> 20:32.708
Make them...

20:33.666 --> 20:34.666
turn around.

20:35.375 --> 20:39.291
Just something to assert a little control.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.708
I'm not going to turn around, Roderick.

20:46.833 --> 20:47.833
That's fine with me.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.916
[thunder rumbling]

20:51.916 --> 20:53.875
So, why are you telling me this?

20:53.875 --> 20:57.416
Because... Well, we were
talking about my kids, weren't we?

20:57.416 --> 20:59.250
And... And this is important to know

20:59.250 --> 21:01.041
when we talk about how they died.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.541
And why I treated them the way I did.

21:04.250 --> 21:09.458
And why they were the way they were,
was because of my dad.

21:11.750 --> 21:15.083
I just promised
I would never do what he did.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.041
I wouldn't close the gates.
If you're my blood, you're my blood.

21:18.041 --> 21:21.583
Doesn't matter how you got here,
who your mother was. I have six kids.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.041
Six kids by five mothers.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.000
But they're all mine.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.375
And I treated them so.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.458
If you're an Usher,

21:31.833 --> 21:33.416
the gates are open. Period.

21:34.666 --> 21:35.750
Matter of principle.

21:37.791 --> 21:39.166
[phone vibrates]

21:41.208 --> 21:42.458
Your granddaughter again?

21:44.541 --> 21:45.500
Yeah.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.708
[Auguste] Mmm. The gates are always open,

21:47.708 --> 21:49.916
but that doesn't mean
you answer the phone.

21:50.916 --> 21:52.375
No, it does not.

21:52.375 --> 21:55.083
Day will come, she'll stop texting.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.500
They all do, sooner or later.

21:57.500 --> 22:01.958
Your grandkids are at your house
right now, with your kids too,

22:01.958 --> 22:03.458
and you're here with me.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.083
So let's skip the soapbox.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.541
Are you watching my house?

22:08.541 --> 22:12.041
If I'm not mistaken,
I never saw your husband at the courtroom.

22:12.625 --> 22:13.583
Not once.

22:13.583 --> 22:17.166
A culmination of your life's work,
and he wasn't there, rooting you on.

22:17.166 --> 22:20.500
Why is that, if you're such an expert
on family values?

22:20.500 --> 22:23.541
And come to think of it, my whole family
was there. Day one.

22:23.541 --> 22:26.166
In fairness, a few of them
were indicted co-conspirators.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.916
- Hey now.
- My family didn't need to be there.

22:28.916 --> 22:31.125
I didn't want them
anywhere near you people.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.041
You always were
an effective orator, Auggie.

22:35.083 --> 22:37.208
Your opening arguments, I was impressed.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.333
I watched that tape back a few times.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.916
That may have been the last time...

22:45.875 --> 22:47.125
you know...

22:47.125 --> 22:50.708
- The last time you were impressed?
- The last time we were all together.

22:52.708 --> 22:56.416
That day was the last day
we were all in the same place.

22:58.458 --> 22:59.458
Alive.

23:01.416 --> 23:03.000
[Auguste] Thank you, Your Honor.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.583
Ladies and gentlemen...

23:05.375 --> 23:07.958
my name is Charles Auguste Dupin.

23:09.041 --> 23:12.458
And it is my privilege to represent
the United States of America

23:12.458 --> 23:15.791
against Fortunato Pharmaceuticals

23:15.791 --> 23:18.333
and the Usher crime family.

23:18.333 --> 23:22.125
Today, I want to tell you why
the United States government

23:22.125 --> 23:24.916
has finally brought these charges

23:24.916 --> 23:28.833
in what will be the most meaningful
pharmaceutical prosecution

23:28.833 --> 23:31.333
in the history of our country.

23:31.333 --> 23:37.416
Now, I know, there have already been
a lot of headlines about Fortunato Pharma.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.375
About Ligodone.

23:40.041 --> 23:43.583
About the opioid epidemic
in our homes and streets.

23:43.583 --> 23:47.916
The mountain of corpses that piled up
since Roderick Usher,

23:47.916 --> 23:52.875
he's sitting over there, began marketing
his painkillers decades ago.

23:53.791 --> 23:58.375
The Usher family under CEO Roderick Usher
and COO Madeline Usher

23:59.000 --> 24:03.416
spent four decades growing Fortunato
into one of the most profitable,

24:03.416 --> 24:05.833
powerful companies on the planet Earth.

24:05.833 --> 24:10.291
They've achieved this
by doing awful, awful things.

24:11.166 --> 24:17.833
Flagrantly violating regulations, statutes
and the most fundamental ethics.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.458
And at the cost of people's lives.

24:23.458 --> 24:27.458
We will prove that Fortunato,
as a matter of policy,

24:27.458 --> 24:30.125
engages in misleading marketing practices.

24:30.125 --> 24:33.208
It claims its products
are safe and effective,

24:34.208 --> 24:36.750
and destroys any evidence
that they are not.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.416
Burns evidence, fabricates evidence,

24:40.125 --> 24:43.625
destroys, defiles, degrades and defrauds.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.666
And the reason they aren't sweating,

24:47.916 --> 24:51.000
the reason their lead attorney
and enforcer Mr. Arthur Pym--

24:51.000 --> 24:52.750
- Objection.
- [Judge] Sustained.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.833
Their lead attorney, Mr. Arthur Pym,

24:55.833 --> 24:58.583
he's the one doing the crossword puzzle
while I'm talking.

24:59.416 --> 25:04.625
They believe that people like them
don't go to prison.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.250
Ladies and gentlemen, they're right.

25:07.791 --> 25:12.750
In 40 years, not one thing,
not one indictment, not one charge.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.333
Not even a speeding ticket.

25:14.333 --> 25:19.083
Not one consequence
has stuck to Roderick Usher

25:19.083 --> 25:21.458
or Madeline Usher
or anyone else in the family.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.750
- Objection.
- Sustained.

25:25.083 --> 25:28.500
The House of Usher
has weathered every storm,

25:28.500 --> 25:30.750
sling and arrow and stands higher,

25:30.750 --> 25:35.166
stronger and darker today
than ever before.

25:35.875 --> 25:39.083
But you're going to hear
something else too.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.041
Something they don't expect.

25:41.041 --> 25:44.000
And the reason why this trial's
going to have a different outcome.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.458
You're going to hear from one of them.

25:49.083 --> 25:52.166
An informant from within the inner circle.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.791
Someone so close to this family's crimes,

25:54.791 --> 25:57.166
their testimony and evidence
will be unimpeachable.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.041
- Objection!
- [Judge] Approach.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.708
[people murmuring]

26:07.791 --> 26:09.333
If such a witness exists,

26:09.333 --> 26:11.708
they have not been made known
to the defense.

26:11.708 --> 26:13.541
That violates basic discovery,

26:13.541 --> 26:15.625
and the government
knows better, Your Honor.

26:15.625 --> 26:18.666
This witness came forward
at great personal risk,

26:18.666 --> 26:20.458
would be in danger if exposed.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.041
They even fear for their life.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.958
Your Honor, we have reason to believe
this courtroom is compromised.

26:25.958 --> 26:27.083
[Arthur] That's absurd!

26:27.083 --> 26:31.208
And until we are satisfied, we will keep
this informant's identity confidential.

26:31.208 --> 26:34.208
The government's position
is that the danger is real and immediate.

26:34.208 --> 26:37.583
All the more reason not to mention this
in your opening argument, Mr. Dupin.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.291
You're right. Your Honor, I...

26:40.833 --> 26:42.791
Well, I got ahead of myself.

26:42.791 --> 26:45.791
I'm not the young lawyer I used to be.
I'll happily strike.

26:49.333 --> 26:54.000
[Judge] We'll disregard the allusion
to an informant for the time being.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.541
Strike from the record, please.

26:56.708 --> 26:57.916
[gavel banging]

26:57.916 --> 26:59.750
Well, I think we're all frustrated.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.208
In the past year, what?

27:01.208 --> 27:05.125
Fifty-four, fifty-five thousand people
have died because...

27:06.208 --> 27:07.208
of greed.

27:07.916 --> 27:09.833
- Family dinner.
- All of them?

27:09.833 --> 27:11.125
Spouses too.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.166
[Auguste] No, this is not
a joyful day for me.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.666
I wish that individuals like the Ushers

27:17.666 --> 27:21.000
would take responsibility for things
they've caused in people's lives.

27:21.791 --> 27:23.583
[Frederick] Holy fuck, this is bad.

27:27.416 --> 27:30.166
Dad doesn't do family dinners.
This is about one thing.

27:30.708 --> 27:33.041
- The mole.
- [Lenore] Informant.

27:33.041 --> 27:35.041
A mole is one of them who infiltrated us,

27:35.041 --> 27:37.500
an informant is one of us
giving something to them.

27:37.500 --> 27:41.083
Okay, so a mole is like
Leonardo DiCaprio in <i>The Departed,</i>

27:41.791 --> 27:44.083
an informant is Jack Nicholson
in <i>The Departed.</i>

27:44.083 --> 27:46.750
He was! Nicholson was talking to the Feds
the whole time.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.875
I get it. There are other movies, Dad.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.208
- Not as good as <i>The Departed.</i>
- Look at this one.

27:51.208 --> 27:53.416
You are getting ridiculously good
at that, honey.

27:53.416 --> 27:55.583
- Well, I want your dad to love it.
- [ball thuds]

27:55.583 --> 27:58.250
And this always just delights him
when he's in such a mood.

27:58.250 --> 27:59.958
[scoffs] Well, yeah, there's a...

27:59.958 --> 28:02.291
[sighs] ...an informant in the family.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.625
I mean, that can't be true,
can it? [sighs]

28:05.625 --> 28:08.458
I don't think it can be true.
If it is true, it's Perry.

28:08.458 --> 28:10.041
Oh, he's just a kid, Freddie.

28:10.041 --> 28:13.000
Who knows what that crazy little sh--
Sorry, honey.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.708
Who knows what that crazy little spit-head
will or won't do?

28:16.708 --> 28:18.500
And why the fuck-- Sorry, honey.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.541
Why the fuck would anybody think
it would serve their best interests

28:21.541 --> 28:24.375
to become a goddamn informant
for the government?

28:24.375 --> 28:27.125
Well, I mean,
they'd have to be pretty brave, I guess.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.208
Are the charges true?

28:30.416 --> 28:33.000
Because if not,
we've got nothing to worry about,

28:33.000 --> 28:37.041
but if someone really broke the law,
shouldn't they be punished?

28:37.041 --> 28:40.833
Lenore, that is a brave
and thoughtful thing to say.

28:41.791 --> 28:44.125
Especially if you want to get
written out of the will.

28:45.666 --> 28:47.791
[Bill] <i>You don't think
he'd do that, do you?</i>

28:47.791 --> 28:49.708
The only thing you can say
about Freddie is

28:49.708 --> 28:52.166
he wants Dad to love him
more than anything.

28:52.166 --> 28:55.208
He's shit at business, but he wouldn't
do anything to piss him off.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.583
My money is on one of the bastards.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.458
Maybe we've all
just underestimated Freddie.

29:00.458 --> 29:02.708
When your dad goes down,
Freddie's on the throne.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.416
Maybe he's giving him a little push.

29:04.416 --> 29:05.333
Why bother?

29:05.333 --> 29:08.541
He gets everything,
no matter how inept he is, apparently.

29:08.541 --> 29:09.875
Just look at his name.

29:09.875 --> 29:13.125
Frederick is as close to Roderick
as you get without a junior.

29:13.916 --> 29:16.291
I don't know why
he didn't just call him Froderick.

29:16.291 --> 29:19.083
- Oh, it's probably Perry.
- What about your new stepmom?

29:19.583 --> 29:20.666
- Could be Juno.
- Shut it!

29:20.666 --> 29:24.333
Don't mention her ever.
She doesn't exist. Do you understand?

29:24.333 --> 29:27.750
She's not in the will, is she?
He has to be smarter than that.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.458
Doesn't exist.

29:30.291 --> 29:31.666
Also doesn't know anything.

29:31.666 --> 29:34.916
- God, the timing. Bill--
- You could always push back the launch.

29:34.916 --> 29:36.000
No. No way.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Goldbug has to go off on time.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.291
I built the launch date
into the presentation.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.625
- Dad's already signed off.
- I mean, the trial.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.750
All the rest,
the world will understand, Tammy.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.958
I don't give a shit about the world.

29:47.958 --> 29:51.791
I care about what Dad thinks,
and he'd ride this out, so we ride it out.

29:51.791 --> 29:55.791
Goldbug will show him that
the Usher empire should be a matriarchy.

29:55.791 --> 29:59.666
And Tamerlane Usher should be the queen.
So just tell me what you need.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.083
I need Bill T. Wilson.

30:03.125 --> 30:05.291
So you just keep being him, okay?

30:06.208 --> 30:07.375
You warm up BILLT Nation,

30:07.375 --> 30:11.291
you keep those 10 million subscribers
all frothy for me.

30:11.291 --> 30:13.125
You know Blippi has 12 million?

30:13.125 --> 30:17.125
Fuck Blippi. And fuck this trial.
And fuck this informant.

30:17.958 --> 30:19.000
[sighs]

30:19.000 --> 30:20.333
Speaking of fucking...

30:21.125 --> 30:24.375
Who knows how late this goes tonight.
I canceled the girl.

30:24.916 --> 30:27.666
[hesitates] I didn't know
there was a girl tonight.

30:27.666 --> 30:30.666
Well, there was and she's cancelled.
Well, pushed, today.

30:30.666 --> 30:34.250
Dad needs to see his kids
don't need half a billion dollars

30:34.250 --> 30:37.125
and an endless supply of test monkeys
to be successful.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.291
[ECG beeping]

30:38.291 --> 30:41.166
[Alessandra] Just about got it.

30:42.916 --> 30:43.875
Ready?

30:51.208 --> 30:53.791
[breathes deeply, chuckles]

30:56.875 --> 30:59.166
[Alessandra] All right.
Let's close her up.

31:00.416 --> 31:01.833
Then cross our fingers.

31:06.041 --> 31:08.541
[Victorine] <i>It worked.
It really fucking worked.</i>

31:08.541 --> 31:09.833
I have to say,

31:09.833 --> 31:12.125
I think we're going to struggle
to get peer review.

31:12.125 --> 31:13.958
Don't say it's because of the nightshade.

31:13.958 --> 31:16.791
Because of the nightshade.
I am gonna say it again.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.916
This new powder your dad sent over...

31:18.916 --> 31:20.916
- Oh. [scoffs]
- ...it's gonna poison the study.

31:20.916 --> 31:22.416
Hey. You hear those stories?

31:22.416 --> 31:25.250
Tourists in South America
get powder blown in their face

31:25.250 --> 31:26.916
and it paralyzes them?

31:26.916 --> 31:28.916
This is the same stuff.

31:28.916 --> 31:31.166
Our trial's never going to look legit

31:31.166 --> 31:34.000
if we're using
an experimental Fortunato paralytic.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.416
We'll just have to
keep it away from Perry.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.291
Or it'll end up in some co-ed's drink.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.416
[chuckles]

31:40.333 --> 31:43.250
- You sure you want me to come tonight?
- What?

31:43.250 --> 31:46.541
Seems like everybody's going to have
their guns out after court today.

31:46.541 --> 31:48.791
- The informant?
- No, you have to come.

31:48.791 --> 31:50.750
It's Camille, we all know it's Camille.

31:50.750 --> 31:53.875
- It's going to be a bloodbath.
- They said, bring Al.

31:53.875 --> 31:57.625
I'm sorry, Dr. Ruiz, but you have to come.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.208
[Leo] <i>You absolutely cannot come.</i>

31:59.208 --> 32:00.833
[Julius] <i>I'd like to meet your family.</i>

32:00.833 --> 32:04.500
But there's a whole process for that.
Significant others are a thing.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.833
You don't want that yet.

32:06.416 --> 32:08.166
The prenup's like a fucking phone book.

32:08.166 --> 32:11.500
[Julius] <i>Leo, you let me move in,
but you won't let me meet your family?</i>

32:11.500 --> 32:14.000
That's right.
I don't know when I'm going to get back,

32:14.000 --> 32:15.333
but we'll talk about it then.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.416
[Julius] <i>I'll be right up.
I'm in the elevator.</i>

32:17.416 --> 32:19.208
<i>- We can talk about it in a minute.</i>
- Oh.

32:19.208 --> 32:20.250
You're in the elevator.

32:21.291 --> 32:23.083
Okay, see you in a sec. [sighs]

32:23.083 --> 32:25.291
- You've got to go.
- You promised a selfie.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.541
Now. Fuck.

32:26.541 --> 32:29.750
Okay, you are going to have to wait
out here, okay?

32:29.750 --> 32:31.458
Are you fucking serious?

32:31.458 --> 32:32.541
Yeah.

32:32.541 --> 32:35.583
There's a blanket on the sofa,
hide under that or something.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.000
I don't know. Come on.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.166
I'll let you out
when he goes to the bathroom.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.333
Okay. My friends aren't going to believe
I met Napoleon Usher.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.833
- Okay.
- [giggles]

32:46.791 --> 32:50.375
- Hey. Why are you home early?
- [chuckles]

32:50.375 --> 32:54.500
- Not that I'm complaining.
- I figured, um... shit might hit the fan.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.166
I saw the clips on the news.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.041
Hey.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.500
[Leo] Mmm. Mmm...

33:01.416 --> 33:03.583
- [exhales] Okay.
- [inhales]

33:03.583 --> 33:05.250
You sure I can't come with you?

33:05.250 --> 33:07.708
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
- [meows]

33:07.708 --> 33:09.125
It was on the news?

33:09.125 --> 33:10.791
You're kidding. It was all over the news.

33:10.791 --> 33:11.833
- Hey, Pluto.
- [Pluto meows]

33:14.291 --> 33:17.166
Hey, sweetie. Are you being good
for Other Daddy? Are you?

33:17.166 --> 33:18.125
Hey!

33:18.125 --> 33:20.250
Why don't we put the news on
in the bedroom?

33:20.250 --> 33:23.250
[Camille] We're coming out swinging.
Front-facing stuff.

33:23.250 --> 33:24.166
Softballs like Fox,

33:24.166 --> 33:27.208
Hannity knows which side
his dick's buttered on. He'll be friendly.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.166
Tucker?

33:28.166 --> 33:30.208
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

33:30.958 --> 33:34.833
Yes, um, call Bresnickan at <i>Vanity Fair,</i>
see if he wants a profile on Leo.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.541
We can let Leo help out for a change.

33:36.541 --> 33:38.916
He can talk about his Jordans,
and his charity work.

33:38.916 --> 33:41.541
Kimmel, Colbert, also Leo.

33:41.541 --> 33:46.166
And fuck it, fine, Victorine as well,
Victorine will work for <i>Vanity</i> and <i>Cosmo.</i>

33:46.166 --> 33:48.458
- For some reason, people like her.
- Uh, your step...

33:49.666 --> 33:53.625
Juno will be at the Met this weekend,
your dad's office asked for some <i>Page Six.</i>

33:53.625 --> 33:55.750
They scraped her off
an emergency room floor.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.125
Do they think I can turn her
into Princess Grace?

33:58.125 --> 34:00.791
Old enough to be her grandfather.
That'll never not be gross.

34:00.791 --> 34:03.541
It's fine, whatever. Fine.
Give them what they want.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.458
Um, priority one is the informant.

34:06.458 --> 34:09.958
I want you to start with Perry obviously,
but I don't think

34:09.958 --> 34:13.333
he's clever enough to keep it off TikTok
if he was dealing with the Feds.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.500
Do you need us after dinner?

34:15.500 --> 34:16.583
No, not tonight.

34:16.583 --> 34:20.333
What I do need is for you to stay on top
of Victorine and the rest of it.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.625
If this informant is real,
I have to find them.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.166
It's tough with Victorine.
She knows you're watching.

34:25.166 --> 34:28.750
I know, you'll figure it out. We're gonna
find out who's talking to the Feds.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.375
Then I'll freeze their fucking head

34:30.375 --> 34:32.458
and give it to my father
on a platinum plate.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.500
See if Cartier will make a platinum plate.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.291
I still am so nervous.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.458
I've never hosted anything before.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.875
Moderated an NA meeting once.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.833
And only once. It was a disaster.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.333
You'll be great.
You don't have to do anything.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.541
But all of them? All at once?

34:56.541 --> 35:01.375
Thank God we didn't have a wedding.
I didn't have to look them all in the eye.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.791
- They hate me.
- They don't.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.375
Well, except Freddie.

35:05.958 --> 35:08.125
But I'm pretty sure
he's just kissing your arse.

35:08.125 --> 35:11.958
They will love you because I love you,
and the only thing stronger than love

35:11.958 --> 35:14.708
is how scared they are
of getting cut out of the will.

35:14.708 --> 35:16.750
- [door opens]
- [man] Excuse me.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
I'm sorry.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.875
Don, what are you doing here?
Have you met my wife?

35:23.875 --> 35:27.708
Juno, this is Dr. Donaldson.
He's been with me a long time now.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.750
He'll be taking over your care soon
as you're done with Lewis.

35:30.750 --> 35:34.791
I was going to call, but figured
this was important enough that, uh...

35:36.625 --> 35:37.916
I need to talk to you.

35:38.500 --> 35:42.000
- Go ahead.
- [Donaldson] Alone, I think might be best.

35:54.000 --> 35:54.916
[car beeps]

36:11.541 --> 36:13.916
Hey. Prospero is here.

36:14.958 --> 36:16.041
You ready for him?

36:16.041 --> 36:17.125
What?

36:19.208 --> 36:20.541
[bottle opens]

36:20.541 --> 36:22.541
[Prospero] This is a Glenfiddich. '96.

36:24.291 --> 36:27.916
- '96, the year...
- The year I was born. Yes. Exactly.

36:28.541 --> 36:30.958
Glenfiddich is totally into this idea,
by the way.

36:30.958 --> 36:32.916
We make it the official whiskey
of the club

36:32.916 --> 36:35.583
and they open up the entire library
of bottles to us.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.583
You've had a year, a calendar year

36:38.583 --> 36:41.791
to come up with a proposal
for your first business venture,

36:41.791 --> 36:46.000
a venture we'd like to support,
and you've come up with a nightclub.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.541
Yes. Obviously,
you're not thinking big enough.

36:48.541 --> 36:49.458
- Uh...
- [Madeline] Hmm.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.333
Is the flagship club going to be amazing?

36:51.333 --> 36:54.125
Of course it is,
but it's the franchise possibilities,

36:54.125 --> 36:57.083
Prospero Rome, Prospero New York,
Prospero Dubai...

36:57.083 --> 37:01.416
Well, outside of naming
this, uh, establishment after yourself,

37:01.416 --> 37:03.541
what else makes it at all worthwhile?

37:03.541 --> 37:06.500
Well, this isn't a fucking
Dave & Buster's, Aunt Madeline,

37:06.500 --> 37:08.750
I'm talking Berghain. Limelight.

37:09.375 --> 37:13.208
Prospero's will be one of the most
exclusive nightclubs in the entire world.

37:13.208 --> 37:16.291
We'll turn movie stars
and monarchs away with attitude,

37:16.291 --> 37:19.666
we're going to make Studio 54
look like fucking <i>Romper Room.</i>

37:19.666 --> 37:23.791
And you're going to do this
by marking up bottles of Glenfiddich.

37:23.791 --> 37:26.125
I'm not selling Glenfiddich.
I'm-- I'm selling...

37:27.125 --> 37:29.041
hedonism, privilege.

37:29.750 --> 37:34.125
It's a dark room with killer music,
few rules, fewer consequences.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.791
It's where the movie starlet
everybody fucking worships

37:36.791 --> 37:40.875
is busy giving head to the real VIPs,
in the corner.

37:41.416 --> 37:43.958
Let me come to the office,
show you the numbers,

37:43.958 --> 37:45.416
franchise projections are good.

37:45.416 --> 37:48.541
- I'm thinking a tiered membership--
- Roderick, please, any time.

37:48.541 --> 37:51.333
Oh, tiered membership,
why didn't you say so? No.

37:51.333 --> 37:53.166
We won't set up a meeting at the office.

37:53.166 --> 37:55.625
Being an Usher
is about changing the fucking world.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.791
It's not a blow job whisky bar.

37:58.541 --> 38:01.541
Look at the numbers. I'll come
to the office on Monday and you can--

38:01.541 --> 38:03.541
Fuck's sake. That's all.

38:06.666 --> 38:07.500
[sighs]

38:14.791 --> 38:17.250
[door opens, closes]

38:18.375 --> 38:21.916
Well, I don't think he's the informant,
but got no clue about business.

38:22.458 --> 38:25.833
I know it's important to you
everybody gets that first loan, but--

38:25.833 --> 38:27.083
He's not making it easy.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.166
Let's get in there and watch their eyes.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.916
When the paperwork's passed out,
I'll be able to tell.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.000
What is going on with you?

38:35.583 --> 38:38.708
- Something is going on with you.
- All good.

38:40.625 --> 38:41.583
Right behind you.

38:47.416 --> 38:49.416
[footsteps receding]

38:51.333 --> 38:54.666
[door opens, closes]

39:02.125 --> 39:03.041
[sighs]

39:04.666 --> 39:08.000
[breathes deeply]

39:11.083 --> 39:12.000
For the road.

39:29.708 --> 39:30.833
[Morrie clears throat]

39:31.625 --> 39:36.208
I thought we could all benefit from this.
Um, Pharmaceutical Law.

39:36.208 --> 39:39.583
- Maybe something in here can help us.
- [Roderick] No, really?

39:39.583 --> 39:43.083
Arthur, dig into this book.
Find something for our defense.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.458
Oh, no.

39:44.458 --> 39:47.916
- Wait, it's... cake.
- [light applause]

39:51.875 --> 39:55.208
Well, I swear, if your TV show
had been about your cakes,

39:55.208 --> 39:56.625
it would have run 20 seasons.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.458
[Morrie chuckles] Care to wash it down?

39:59.083 --> 40:00.000
Coffee?

40:01.250 --> 40:02.625
- No way.
- Mmm.

40:02.625 --> 40:03.750
I bet it's cake.

40:05.041 --> 40:06.958
- [Morrie chuckles]
- [all applauding]

40:09.500 --> 40:12.666
Freddie, marrying this woman
might be the one thing you didn't fuck up.

40:13.250 --> 40:14.250
She's a genius.

40:14.916 --> 40:16.375
[chuckles] Well...

40:16.375 --> 40:20.000
We have that in common then, Dad.
We're both lucky men.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.541
Oh, for fuck's sake, Freddie.

40:22.541 --> 40:25.625
All right, while you all eat the law,

40:25.625 --> 40:28.958
Mr. Pym has some important paperwork
for each of you.

40:31.166 --> 40:34.000
[Camille] Paperwork from the Pym Reaper,
always a blast.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.041
Wait. Is this also cake?

40:37.041 --> 40:38.500
This is a robust,

40:38.500 --> 40:43.083
new non-disclosure agreement,
and it is consequential.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.750
[Camille] Forfeiture of inheritance?
Waiving of civil suits...

40:45.750 --> 40:49.125
We really should get together more often,
it's a balm for the soul.

40:49.125 --> 40:52.583
Consequence only applies if it's proven
you violated the agreements.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.291
So it seems to me
no one has anything to worry about.

40:55.291 --> 40:57.208
Unless they have something to worry about.

40:57.208 --> 40:59.916
[Madeline] Exactly.
And your father and I appreciate

40:59.916 --> 41:03.750
this display of confidence,
loyalty and family. Now sign it.

41:03.750 --> 41:07.291
It's been a minute since I've gotten
to feel like a member of the family.

41:07.291 --> 41:11.083
Al, have you gotten to sign
an original Pym yet?

41:11.083 --> 41:13.583
It's a rite of passage.
Wait until you see the prenup.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.250
Yes, speaking of prenups,
how are things, Juno?

41:16.750 --> 41:17.750
It's going great.

41:17.750 --> 41:21.416
Yeah, I prefer not to sign anything
without my guy looking at it first.

41:25.125 --> 41:26.041
Or not.

41:26.041 --> 41:29.375
[Victorine] While we're on the subject
and, hate to point this out but,

41:29.375 --> 41:32.166
if there were ever
any one of us collecting,

41:32.166 --> 41:35.250
or even bartering a family secret,
we all know who that is.

41:35.250 --> 41:40.458
- Aw, fuck you very much, Victorine.
- No in-fighting. Jesus, have some dignity.

41:40.458 --> 41:42.000
You want to watch me sign it?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.500
- I'll sign it right now.
- How do you spell "Froderick"?

41:44.500 --> 41:47.500
[Madeline] Get the jokes out now
because this isn't funny.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.083
Fortunato is the reason you exist.

41:50.958 --> 41:52.916
The reason you have
your little knock-offs,

41:52.916 --> 41:56.333
your heart implants, your debutante balls.

41:56.333 --> 41:58.333
Debutante balls?
Is that what you think I do?

41:58.333 --> 42:00.083
[Madeline] The company is the family,

42:00.083 --> 42:03.250
and we expect you
to defend it with your life.

42:03.250 --> 42:06.041
And if anyone, anyone comes after us,

42:06.041 --> 42:10.166
we will exhaust our arsenal
until the threat's neutralized.

42:10.166 --> 42:13.458
By neutralized,
do you mean sued into oblivion,

42:13.458 --> 42:17.500
taken out of the Board,
out of the will, on the streets...

42:17.500 --> 42:20.083
Neutralized. Like dead.

42:21.041 --> 42:25.041
Pym made this document particularly nasty,
I asked him to, but that's not the thing.

42:25.041 --> 42:26.958
When I find out who's been talking,

42:26.958 --> 42:29.750
to the goddamn government,
against your own blood,

42:29.750 --> 42:32.166
there won't be enough of you left to sue.

42:32.166 --> 42:36.791
I'll have to sue the bloody puddle of gore
in the designer shoes.

42:37.708 --> 42:40.250
- Make no mistake, we'll find out.
- $50 million.

42:42.166 --> 42:43.500
To whoever solves it.

42:43.500 --> 42:47.291
To the lucky Usher who figures out
who's talking to the Feds.

42:47.291 --> 42:51.000
Fifty million cash, no strings, no taxes.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.833
Did you just put a--

42:52.833 --> 42:54.791
Yes, I'm putting a bounty on you.

42:54.791 --> 42:58.750
You, the shit bag,
you the informant, you know who you are.

42:59.916 --> 43:01.458
It's 50 million. Sleep tight.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.208
The rest of you...

43:08.125 --> 43:09.125
happy hunting.

I saw them together.</i>

43:16.958 --> 43:19.333
<i>Some of them,
the last time I saw them alive.</i>

43:21.291 --> 43:23.041
If you're saying it was because of...

43:24.166 --> 43:25.166
Well...

43:25.916 --> 43:28.750
because of the informant thing
that all of this happened,

43:28.750 --> 43:33.000
if you're somehow implying
that I'm responsible, even indirectly...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.708
I'm not. I know who's responsible.

43:35.708 --> 43:39.125
You know who's responsible
for which death?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.291
All of them.

43:42.916 --> 43:46.583
Forgive me, Roderick, but the deaths

43:47.458 --> 43:50.208
of your children have been examined,

43:50.208 --> 43:51.875
investigated pretty thoroughly

43:51.875 --> 43:55.000
and, as strange as they may be,
those deaths are unrelated.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.083
I am responsible.

43:57.666 --> 43:59.166
And more to the point,

44:00.041 --> 44:01.208
perhaps...

44:03.250 --> 44:04.250
there is a woman.

44:05.916 --> 44:07.333
[Madeline] <i>I know that face.</i>

44:07.958 --> 44:09.041
<i>You know her too.</i>

44:09.041 --> 44:10.625
A woman I have to tell you about.

44:22.666 --> 44:25.125
New Year's Eve. You know why? Resolutions.

44:26.250 --> 44:27.791
People take that word for granted,

44:27.791 --> 44:30.375
they don't realize
just how heavy a word it is.

44:31.041 --> 44:32.041
Resolution.

44:33.041 --> 44:34.041
Resolve.

44:35.958 --> 44:41.000
Means being unwavering, determined,
a firm commitment to do something, or...

44:42.375 --> 44:43.458
not to do something.

44:44.208 --> 44:48.083
And most people
go their whole, wasted, stupid lives

44:48.083 --> 44:52.291
without one minute of true resolution.

44:55.166 --> 44:56.375
Not me though.

45:00.583 --> 45:01.583
Not me.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
And not Madeline.

He stayed sharp and sober.
Watched everybody else drink.

46:27.875 --> 46:29.708
Both of us. Whisky. Neat.

All dressed up,
didn't wait for the ball to drop?

New Year's and all.

46:44.875 --> 46:47.625
It'll fill up later.
We're a midnight business.
