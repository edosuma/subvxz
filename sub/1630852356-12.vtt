Citizens of Big City!

00:35.750 --> 00:38.289
There is a severe heat warning
in effect!

00:38.290 --> 00:41.249
For your safety,
please remain indoors.

Unless, of course, you are
required to patrol the streets

00:44.250 --> 00:47.249

on a group trip to the beach.

you'll have to pry my

It's quite simple, brother.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.959

the part around my middle,
like a cummerbund?

Uh, now what, may I ask,
is a cummerbund?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.879

that you tie around your waist

a dinner jacket or a tuxedo.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.669

actually!

all the blankets and coats.

in the fireplace,
but we've got no wood.

I want you to apologize
for hoggin' the fan earlier.

into the horseman's lap.

Give me your little shoes, man,
my foot pads are broilin'.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.459
No.

Why won't you
give me your shoes!

08:07.620 --> 08:08.960
- No.

08:11.330 --> 08:15.540
OK! Backswopp the hoop

Ricky Stork and...

08:44.710 --> 08:46.499
Wizard Williams!

08:46.500 --> 08:48.919
[both]
What?!

08:48.920 --> 08:50.579
Please, children,
calm yourselves.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.329
We've come to share with you
an important lesson.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.579
Is it about
over-competitiveness?

08:54.580 --> 08:56.419
And the value of friendship?

08:56.420 --> 08:58.919
No. We just came to tell you
to get out of the sun.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.249
It's too hot!

in the heat of competing,

09:06.750 --> 09:08.499
was built on
a beautiful friendship.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.169
No, you're not listening.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.039
I forfeit the game!

This victory is yours.

But I refuse your forfeit!
