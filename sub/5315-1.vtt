08:23.712 --> 08:25.212
Hello, gorgeous.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.568
Miss Fanny?

10:12.404 --> 10:15.114
- Miss Fanny?
- Down here, Emma. Third row.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.285
I came in early to tidy up,
and the doorman said you were in.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.995
What you doing out there?

10:23.665 --> 10:26.333
It's the one place in the theater
I've never sat.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.006
Maybe things look different from here.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.468
This is the day, isn't it?

10:36.678 --> 10:37.845
Yeah.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.723
Any word yet?

10:40.932 --> 10:43.058
No. The wire just said tonight.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.145
You nervous?

10:47.314 --> 10:50.149
Nervous, happy, scared, excited...

10:53.028 --> 10:55.821
I'm going to make a fresh pot
of coffee. You coming?

10:56.323 --> 10:59.825
No, no. I think I'll just sit here
for a while, okay?

11:00.035 --> 11:02.870
Well, I'll be in the dressing room
if you want me.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.418
Mr. Ziegfeld wants to see you.
When you feel like it, he says.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.295
He'll be waiting in his office.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.590
Thanks, Em.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.932
Did you hear that, Mrs. Strakosh?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.146
Ziegfeld is waiting for me.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.360
For me.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.573
See, you were wrong, Mrs. Strakosh.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.788
No, Fanny, darling, I'm not wrong.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.832
For a girl, for average,
you're a pleasure.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.169
But when people pay good money
in the theater...

11:52.379 --> 11:57.132
...especially the male element,
they want something extra to look at.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.385
But if a girl isn't...

11:59.761 --> 12:02.304
If a girl isn't what?

12:04.140 --> 12:08.894
If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City

12:09.062 --> 12:13.524
All she gets from life
Is pity and a pat

12:13.691 --> 12:18.529
Kindly name a star who hasn't
Won a contest or a pageant

12:18.696 --> 12:21.615
If she hasn't she just never
Gets to bat

12:22.992 --> 12:27.955
She must a-shine in every detail
Like a ring you're buyin' retail

12:28.123 --> 12:32.459
Be a standard size that
Fits a standard dress

12:32.627 --> 12:39.258
When a girl's incidentals
Are no bigger than two lentils

12:40.885 --> 12:43.595
Then to me
It doesn't spell success

12:43.805 --> 12:45.681
Don't worry, they'll look at me.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.643
The whole world will look at me
and be stunned.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.564
That was all right when you were
a child and made funny faces.

12:53.731 --> 12:58.610
- Then, you were cute.
- My condolences, you're no longer cute.

12:58.862 --> 13:03.532
From three faces that could cause ya
To have temporary nausea

13:03.700 --> 13:07.786
Do I have to hear a lecture
Such as that?

13:07.954 --> 13:11.748
Is a nose with deviation
Such a crime against the nation?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.167
Ma. Ma.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.878
Should I throw her into jail
Or drown the cat?

13:16.087 --> 13:18.380
Ma! Bye.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.048
Bye.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.552
So she looks
A bit off balance

13:23.720 --> 13:27.514
She possesses
Golden talents

13:27.682 --> 13:31.435
Or is that a pill too bitter
To digest?

13:47.869 --> 13:52.372
I've got them! Right off the net!
Fresh fish!

13:53.124 --> 13:55.417
Fresh fish!

14:01.049 --> 14:02.216
Wait a minute, wait.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.552
No, no, it's all right.
I'm one of the 8 Beautiful Girls 8.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.724
Well, the makeup helps a lot.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.684
Really.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.364
Sell it, sell it.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.052
Get in there, Fanny.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.100
Knees high. High! Way up there.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.477
Go.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.404
Hold it, Eddie.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.990
Hold it!

15:08.199 --> 15:09.866
You, with the skinny legs.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.371
You. Yes, you, with the bloomers!

15:16.749 --> 15:18.041
Yeah?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.877
- You're fired.
- What?

15:21.170 --> 15:24.965
You call that a replacement? What,
Eddie, did you owe somebody a favor?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.467
- It seemed like a funny idea.
- What's funny?

15:27.635 --> 15:29.344
- That's what I say.
- Back at 4.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.097
Yeah, but listen.
Wait, you're making a mistake.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.059
I've got a lot of experience, honest.
I've been on-stage since I was 10.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.229
Amateur contests,
Gottlieb's Southern Repertory...

15:39.439 --> 15:42.316
...professional companies.
I doubled six parts.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.861
I played a daughter and her father.
A 60-year-old Indian chief.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.112
Listen, girlie...

15:47.280 --> 15:50.949
Please, you've got to face facts.
You don't look like the other girls.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.493
- But...
- You've got skinny legs, you stick out.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.788
- And you are out! Eddie?
- I'm trying to tell you something...

15:56.956 --> 15:58.665
- Sorry, kid.
- Give me a chance!

15:58.833 --> 16:00.876
- Out.
- I do a terrific time step! Watch!

16:01.169 --> 16:02.586
Out.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.259
Look, Mr. Keeney, suppose
all you ever had was onion rolls.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.511
Now, all of a sudden, in walks a bagel.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.723
So you take a look at it and say,
"What is that?"...

16:14.932 --> 16:17.559
...until you tried it.
So that's my trouble.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.311
What's your trouble?

16:19.520 --> 16:22.189
I'm a bagel on a plate
full of onion rolls!

16:22.440 --> 16:24.149
Nobody recognizes me. Listen:

16:24.317 --> 16:28.320
I got 36 expressions
Sweet as pie to tough as leather

16:28.488 --> 16:32.366
And that's six expressions more
Than all them Barrymores put together

16:32.575 --> 16:33.575
Come on.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.035
Instead of just kicking me

16:35.203 --> 16:36.244
Come on.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.289
Why don't they give me a lift?
Well, it must be a plot

16:39.457 --> 16:42.292
'Cause they're scared that I got
Such a gift

16:42.585 --> 16:43.752
Oh, sure. Let's go.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.961
Well, I'm miffed

16:45.380 --> 16:46.546
Hey!

16:47.006 --> 16:53.345
'Cause I'm the greatest star

16:53.513 --> 16:56.682
I am by far

16:56.849 --> 16:59.935
But no one knows it

17:00.103 --> 17:03.397
Wait
They're gonna hear a voice

17:03.564 --> 17:05.315
A silver flute

17:06.693 --> 17:09.569
They'll cheer each toot
Hey, that kid is terrific

17:09.737 --> 17:12.155
When I expose it

17:12.323 --> 17:19.079
Can't you see to look at me
That I'm a natural Camille

17:19.247 --> 17:24.376
As Camille I just feel
I've so much to offer

17:24.544 --> 17:26.461
Hey, listen, kid
I know I'd be divine

17:26.628 --> 17:30.507
Because I'm a natural cougher

17:33.594 --> 17:36.346
Some ain't got it, not a lump

17:36.514 --> 17:40.267
I'm a great big clump of talent
Laugh

17:41.894 --> 17:43.019
They'll bend in half

17:43.187 --> 17:44.730
Did you ever hear the story
About the traveling salesman?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.441
A thousand jokes
Stick around for the jokes

17:47.608 --> 17:48.650
Sure.

17:48.818 --> 17:52.821
A thousand faces
I reiterate

17:52.989 --> 17:55.741
When you're gifted
Then you're gifted

17:55.908 --> 18:00.912
These are facts
I got no ax to grind

18:01.080 --> 18:03.457
Hey, what are you, blind?

18:04.125 --> 18:09.921
In all of the world so far
I'm the greatest star

18:11.424 --> 18:14.342
- No autographs, please.
- What? What'd she say?

18:14.510 --> 18:17.179
You think beautiful girls'll
stay in style forever?

18:17.346 --> 18:20.891
I should say not. Any minute now
they're gonna be out. Finished!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.476
Then it'll be my turn!

18:22.685 --> 18:24.269
- Mom! Ma!
- Mom!

18:24.479 --> 18:30.108
Who is the pip with pizazz?
Who is all ginger and jazz?

18:30.276 --> 18:36.198
Who is as glamorous as?
Who's an American beauty rose?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.326
With an American beauty nose

18:39.494 --> 18:42.162
And 10 American beauty toes

18:42.330 --> 18:44.915
Eyes on the target and wham

18:45.082 --> 18:49.503
One shot, one gunshot
And bam

18:49.670 --> 18:56.718
Hey, Mr. Kenney
Here I am

19:04.977 --> 19:12.567
I'm the greatest star
I am by far

19:12.735 --> 19:16.530
But no one knows it

19:16.697 --> 19:21.368
That's why I was born

19:21.536 --> 19:25.705
I'll blow my horn

19:25.873 --> 19:30.043
Till someone blows it

19:30.211 --> 19:36.383
I'll light up like a light
Right up like a light

19:36.551 --> 19:39.177
I'll flicker then flare up

19:40.555 --> 19:44.766
All the world's gonna stare up

19:44.934 --> 19:47.185
Lookin' down
You'll never see me

19:47.353 --> 19:49.896
Try the sky
'Cause that'll be me

19:50.064 --> 19:54.442
I can make 'em cry
I can make 'em sigh

19:54.610 --> 19:59.698
Someday they'll clamor
For my "drammer"

19:59.866 --> 20:02.242
Have you guessed yet

20:02.410 --> 20:04.202
Who's the best yet

20:04.370 --> 20:09.875
If you ain't
I'll tell you one more time

20:10.042 --> 20:14.838
You'll bet your last dime
In all of the world so far

20:15.006 --> 20:16.882
I am the greatest

20:17.049 --> 20:19.551
Greatest

20:19.719 --> 20:26.975
Star

20:47.914 --> 20:50.123
You're no chorus girl.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.585
You're a singer and a comic.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.005
Yeah. With skinny legs.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.967
So why'd you try out for the chorus?

21:01.344 --> 21:03.553
Because that's what
you were looking for.

21:03.721 --> 21:07.057
If you were looking for a juggler,
I'd have been a juggler.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.310
I just gotta get
on the stage somehow.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.564
How come you hired me?

21:16.859 --> 21:19.110
Because you wanted it so much.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.741
You sure you're tough enough
for show business?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.243
Maybe not.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.123
- Say, can you roller-skate?
- You got a sudden urge to go skating?

21:32.333 --> 21:36.378
I'm trying out a novelty number tomorrow.
If you can skate, be here at noon.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.005
- What about Keeney?
- He won't be in till night.

21:39.173 --> 21:43.176
- By then the number'll be in the show.
- He'll kill you. Might even fire you.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.761
Not if you're good.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.681
Are you sure you can roller-skate?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.979
Can I roller-skate?

21:59.402 --> 22:02.153
- You said you could skate.
- I didn't know I couldn't.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.446
- Nora.
- Sandra.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.698
- Cherry.
- Wilma.

22:04.907 --> 22:05.949
- Ruthie.
- Polly.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.367
Fanny.

22:13.791 --> 22:17.752
The roller skate rag
Is a really up-to-date rag

22:17.920 --> 22:21.798
It's heard every place
You find the grand ole flag

22:21.966 --> 22:25.010
Click your skates
Spin your wheels

22:25.636 --> 22:28.054
You're gonna be surprised

22:29.390 --> 22:31.057
How your torso feels

22:31.267 --> 22:33.143
Go. Get out there.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.647
The girls in Paree
In gay Paree across the sea

22:39.108 --> 22:42.402
Say it's bigger than fads
That ever used to be

22:44.280 --> 22:46.489
Thanks, mister, I really...

22:46.907 --> 22:48.575
Hey, you!

23:32.286 --> 23:34.579
Click your skates
Spin your wheels, twirl your hips

23:34.747 --> 23:36.998
Click, spin, twirl

23:58.062 --> 24:00.355
- Lady...
- What are you doing?

24:00.564 --> 24:02.690
- Stay there.
- What are you doing?

24:02.900 --> 24:06.694
Fanny, they liked you. Go back out
there, Fan. Go ahead, honey.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.072
- Go back...
- It's my show!

24:09.281 --> 24:11.157
No, you don't.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.494
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.000
Her. On her. Over there!

24:49.864 --> 24:51.573
Smile.

27:11.505 --> 27:14.132
Eddie, they liked it!
Did you hear that...?

27:14.341 --> 27:17.051
- Mr. Keeney...
- Eddie, get the next act on.

27:17.261 --> 27:20.596
What do you think I'm paying you for?
So they shouldn't like it?

27:20.764 --> 27:21.973
You're paying me?

27:22.141 --> 27:25.393
I don't know what you're paying me,
but I bet it isn't enough.

27:25.561 --> 27:29.480
When I get around to thinking
about you, I'll let you know.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.864
Well, if it isn't Miss Roller Skates.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.242
- Listen, I'm really sorry, girls.
- Oh, sure you are.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.702
We heard the applause.

27:42.911 --> 27:46.039
I'm sorry I loused up the number,
but I couldn't help it.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.166
Long as I did, I'm glad it was a hit.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.627
Who do you think will see you
in this dump? Florenz Ziegfeld?

27:51.837 --> 27:55.465
Why not? You think the word
can't spread? I'll spread it myself.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.509
I know a lady who knows the lady
who makes his shirts.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.763
- Sure you do.
- He's gonna hear about me.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.807
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm telling you something.

28:05.017 --> 28:08.353
One night, you'll be laughing
and kidding, just like that...

28:08.562 --> 28:10.355
...and there'll be a knock.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.149
You see? And there he'll be, Ziegfeld!

28:20.449 --> 28:23.201
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but the name's Arnstein.

28:25.996 --> 28:28.498
- Did you wanna see someone?
- Yes.

28:28.749 --> 28:29.957
You.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.005
Gorgeous.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.175
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I mean, your shirt.

28:39.385 --> 28:43.304
It's absolutely the most gorgeous
thing I've ever seen in my life.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.181
What's it made out of?

28:45.391 --> 28:48.559
Oh, French handkerchief linen.
It goes very limp, though.

28:48.769 --> 28:53.064
Yeah. I can see.
Except, it's really beautiful.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.566
All the tailcoats I've seen, I mean...

28:55.734 --> 28:57.735
...well, they were rented, you know...

28:57.945 --> 29:00.029
...they all got these stiff shirts.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.949
Well, this one's just for fun.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.327
You've probably heard this
very often that it's boring...

29:06.495 --> 29:09.831
...but I had to tell you how much
I enjoyed what you did.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.376
It's not so boring. You'd be
surprised how boring it isn't.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.045
You're going to be a big star
someday, Miss...

29:17.464 --> 29:18.631
Brice. Fanny Brice.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.675
Fanny Brice.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.136
I'll look for it in lights.

29:24.388 --> 29:27.098
- What'd you say your name was?
- Nick Arnstein.

29:28.267 --> 29:34.313
Nicky Arnstein, Nicky Arnstein
What a beautiful, beautiful name

29:35.732 --> 29:39.235
- Thinking about me yet, Mr. Keeney?
- Oh, it's you. Hello, Arnstein.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.363
I'll give you $25 a week.
Take it or leave it.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.157
- I'll take it.
- Leave it.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.201
I'm offering 35.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.495
You're offering? Since when are you...?

29:49.705 --> 29:51.539
In show business? I'm not.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.792
One of your competitors
authorized me to deal for him...

29:55.002 --> 29:58.337
...whenever I ran across a talent
I considered really unique.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.589
So...

29:59.798 --> 30:00.882
...$35 a week?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.592
- Forty.
- Forty-five.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.010
Fifty.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.929
Well, I wasn't authorized
to go over 50.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.849
Keeney, she's yours for $50 a week.
Congratulations.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.685
Yeah. Yeah.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.982
Fifty dollars a week?

30:18.484 --> 30:20.943
Fifty a week?
I'm practically a millionaire!

30:21.153 --> 30:24.322
- Hey, who's the competitor?
- There's no competitor.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.992
What do you mean, you were bluffing?
Like in a poker game?

30:28.702 --> 30:31.537
- Well, what if Keeney stopped first?
- You'd have lost.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.666
- I would've lost a job.
- I was willing to take a chance.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.585
With my job?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.087
Hey, Nicky.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.007
- Come on.
- We're waiting. Hurry up.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.092
I'll be with you in a minute.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.429
Are those yours?

30:48.639 --> 30:51.140
I'm just minding them for a friend.

30:51.725 --> 30:55.394
Look, we're going to Delmonico's
for supper. Won't you join us?

30:56.313 --> 30:58.856
We'd be happy to wait
while you change.

30:59.149 --> 31:02.401
I'd have to change too much.
Nobody could wait that long.

31:04.071 --> 31:07.615
I'd have a much better time
and a lot more laughs.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.326
Well...

31:11.245 --> 31:12.828
...thanks anyway...

31:13.038 --> 31:16.123
...but I gotta meet a gang of people
at my mother's saloon.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.251
Honest.

31:21.171 --> 31:23.506
You want a couple of jokes
to take with you?

31:24.341 --> 31:28.302
I'll wait till the next time we meet,
which will be soon, I hope.

31:32.599 --> 31:37.270
Nicky Arnstein, Nicky Arnstein
He's got polish on his nails

31:42.943 --> 31:44.318
Hey!

31:47.322 --> 31:52.076
Tell them to put a little starch in the last
rinse. That way, it won't go so limp.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.664
A little starch...

31:56.873 --> 31:58.916
...in the last rinse.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.794
Thank you. I won't forget.

32:06.925 --> 32:12.346
Nicky Arnstein, Nicky Arnstein

32:14.433 --> 32:20.688
I'll never see him again

32:28.196 --> 32:29.238
There's a telegram!

32:29.448 --> 32:34.035
- There's a telegram for Mrs. Brice!
- Telegram, telegram, telegram!

32:34.244 --> 32:35.328
Come on, telegram!

32:35.495 --> 32:38.497
There's a telegram for the Brices!
The Western Union man.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.250
That's life for you. Somebody's dead.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.544
Come on, telegram!

32:43.754 --> 32:46.422
A telegram for Mrs. Brice!

32:55.474 --> 32:58.100
What is it? Come on.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.322
- What do you think of my new song?
- I like the old one better.

33:11.531 --> 33:15.117
Yeah, but I'm tired of it.
I've been singing it for six months.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.161
- So?
- So?

33:17.371 --> 33:18.579
What?

33:20.123 --> 33:21.499
What's that?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.971
- Oh, look, here's Fanny now.
- Let her mama tell her.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.556
Rosie.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.770
Who is it, Mama?

33:43.814 --> 33:45.481
Auntie Blanche or Lou?

33:46.566 --> 33:48.401
Ziegfeld.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.277
He died?

33:53.490 --> 33:55.116
"Dear Miss Brice. Stop.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.785
Please meet me
at the New Amsterdam Theatre...

33:57.994 --> 34:00.913
...on Thursday morning at 11. Stop.
Florence Ziegfeld."

34:01.123 --> 34:03.833
See? By heart, like
the Pledge Allegiance.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.587
Mazel tov, Fanny, darling, mazel tov.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.965
- I knew you could do it.
- My stomach aches.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.009
I wonder how a mother
could call a boy Florence.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.678
It's Florenz.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.639
I wonder how a mother
could call a boy Florenz.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.350
- You think it's a job or an audition?
- A job.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.937
You know what I think?
Somebody talked to him about me.

34:25.147 --> 34:29.150
See, I met this guy backstage
one night with a ruffled shirt on.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.069
Just the kind of guy you figure
to know Ziegfeld.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.947
I bet you he said a word.
That's what must have happened.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.409
- Oh, my head aches.
- Nothing aches.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.579
- You're built like a horse.
- I have nothing to wear.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.750
What's she been walking around in
all this time? Towels?

34:45.958 --> 34:49.085
It's coming too easy.
That's what's got me scared.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.089
Where's all the suffering
before you click?

34:52.299 --> 34:56.051
And the hard knocks, and the setbacks
you're supposed to learn from?

34:56.261 --> 34:59.930
This is too quick.
I haven't suffered enough yet.

35:03.351 --> 35:07.605
You haven't got the job yet. Who says
if you get it, in a week you can't lose it?

35:07.773 --> 35:09.690
Cheer up. Maybe you'll suffer later.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.526
If you're as bossy with Ziegfeld
as you are with...

35:12.736 --> 35:15.362
I am not bossy with you or anyone.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.490
And even if I was...

35:17.741 --> 35:20.159
...Ziegfeld isn't just anyone.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.286
And believe me...

35:22.496 --> 35:25.289
...whatever he tells me to do,
that's what I'll do.

35:25.499 --> 35:32.046
Even our piano in the parlor

35:32.214 --> 35:38.511
Father bought for 10 cents
On the dollar

35:38.678 --> 35:42.890
Second hand pearls
I'm wearin'

35:43.058 --> 35:45.059
Second hand curls

35:45.227 --> 35:51.273
I never get a single thing
That's new

35:52.317 --> 35:58.948
Even Jake the plumber
He's the man I adore

35:59.115 --> 36:05.538
He had the nerve to tell me
He's been married before

36:05.705 --> 36:12.169
Everyone knows that I'm just
Second hand Rose

36:12.337 --> 36:25.432
From Second Avenue

36:32.399 --> 36:35.401
Bravo, Miss Brice! Perfectly charming,
and I'm delighted.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.988
John, will you get the bride music
for Miss Brice, please?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.282
- Yes, sir.
- You mean I'm hired?

36:41.783 --> 36:45.119
- I'm a Ziegfeld Girl?
- That's exactly what you are.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.498
I'm a Ziegfeld Girl.

36:49.708 --> 36:54.211
Miss Brice, you will do
"Second Hand Rose" in the first act...

36:54.421 --> 36:57.172
...and you will sing
this new number in the finale.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.674
Anything you say.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.428
And just go along with Tony,
and he'll teach it to you.

37:04.598 --> 37:08.142
John, I want to see the second act
opening right from the top.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.936
I'll watch it from the balcony.
Turn on the rails.

37:11.104 --> 37:15.691
Right, sir. Oh, Bill, will you turn on
the rails for Mr. Ziegfeld, please?

37:15.901 --> 37:18.235
We'll do the second act opening, kids.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.995
This way, miss.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.041
Hey!

37:32.250 --> 37:33.792
Paul. Paul?

37:34.002 --> 37:36.503
Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Ziegfeld?

37:36.755 --> 37:39.173
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ziegfeld?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.717
Mr. Ziegfeld?

37:43.553 --> 37:45.054
Georgia, you're late.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.347
Sorry, Flo.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.558
- Where is he?
- He's up above. Like God.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.315
Mr. Ziegfeld?

37:57.442 --> 37:59.944
Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Ziegfeld?

38:00.612 --> 38:01.695
Yes, Miss Brice?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.031
I don't wanna be in the finale.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.581
What was that you said?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.918
Well, I just...

38:16.211 --> 38:17.503
I can't sing words like:

38:17.671 --> 38:22.591
"I am the beautiful reflection
of my love's affection." I mean...

38:23.593 --> 38:25.094
Why not?

38:26.179 --> 38:30.057
Well, it's embarrassing.
Why don't I just do my first act number...

38:30.225 --> 38:32.059
...and we'll call it a night, okay?

38:32.352 --> 38:35.062
- No, it's not okay.
- Why not?

38:35.605 --> 38:39.108
Miss Brice, may I remind you
that you're in my theater?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.403
So nobody argues with the landlord?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.448
Wait right there. I'm coming down.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.829
Take five. Take five, everybody.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.998
Just take...

38:54.207 --> 38:55.249
...five.

39:00.380 --> 39:04.049
- Is that bad, he's coming down?
- Only if you wanna stay in the show.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.968
- What's your name?
- Fanny Brice.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.219
- Georgia James.
- Hi.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.972
- Tell him you were wrong.
- But I'm not.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.518
Well, in that case,
it was nice to have met you.

39:14.769 --> 39:15.811
Miss Brice?

39:19.274 --> 39:22.151
Now, what is all this?
Not two minutes ago you said:

39:22.360 --> 39:24.820
"Anything you say, Mr. Ziegfeld."
Remember?

39:25.030 --> 39:27.990
Yes, and I'm sorry.
But if I come out opening night...

39:28.158 --> 39:31.869
...telling the audience how beautiful
I am, I'll be back at Keeney's...

39:32.037 --> 39:35.706
...before the curtain comes down.
- I assure you that won't happen.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.250
But I need a strong voice
in the finale.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.669
But please take me out of it.

39:41.755 --> 39:44.465
Miss Brice, if I take you out
of the finale...

39:44.674 --> 39:48.469
...I will also take you out of the Follies.
It's just that simple.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.520
Okay, you win.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.648
Thank you.

40:02.859 --> 40:05.235
You don't win fair, but you win.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.782
John, forget the second act opening.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.785
I want to see the bride number
with Miss Brice.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.287
- She can walk through it.
- Right, sir.

40:15.497 --> 40:17.623
All right,
this'll be the bride number.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.374
Mr. Ziegfeld?

40:21.294 --> 40:22.336
Mr. Ziegfeld!

40:25.006 --> 40:26.131
Now what?

40:26.800 --> 40:29.384
- Listen, can I hum it?
- All right. Okay, girl.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.972
You will sing the words
exactly as written.

40:34.849 --> 40:39.186
And that, Miss Brice,
is the end of this discussion.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.898
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.

40:45.318 --> 40:47.528
Whatever you say, Mr. Ziegfeld.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.030
I'm sorry.

40:58.373 --> 41:02.876
The most beautiful bride
In the world

41:03.044 --> 41:06.588
And we are the very lucky gents

41:06.756 --> 41:12.594
Who'll be standing at the sides
Of the scintillating brides

41:12.762 --> 41:22.771
Florenz Ziegfeld
Now presents

41:24.691 --> 41:32.739
You are the beautiful reflection
Of his love's affection

41:32.907 --> 41:38.078
The walking illustration
Of his adoration

41:38.246 --> 41:42.416
His love makes you beautiful

41:42.584 --> 41:48.380
So beautiful
So beautiful

41:48.548 --> 41:51.758
You ask your looking glass
What is it

41:51.926 --> 41:57.055
Makes you so exquisite
The answer to your query

41:57.223 --> 42:00.559
Comes back, dearie

42:00.727 --> 42:07.149
His love makes you beautiful
So beautiful

42:07.734 --> 42:11.778
So beautiful

42:11.946 --> 42:17.201
And woman loved
Is woman glorified

42:17.368 --> 42:27.377
You'll make a beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful bride

43:01.246 --> 43:06.250
The winter bride is typified
By Christmas, frost and fairies

43:06.417 --> 43:11.672
An though the weather is changeable
Her virtue never varies

43:22.141 --> 43:24.601
The springtime bride
Is starry-eyed

43:24.769 --> 43:26.812
And poets often say

43:26.980 --> 43:29.648
No other bride
Would dare to dream

43:29.816 --> 43:32.359
The dreams that April
May

43:32.527 --> 43:37.239
The summer bride is glorified
By Merlin's magic touch

43:37.407 --> 43:39.950
A lucky man receives
The love

43:40.118 --> 43:41.201
Of June
July

43:41.369 --> 43:42.703
And such

43:42.870 --> 43:47.791
The autumn bride is prudent and wise
At sweet 16 or 20

43:47.959 --> 43:52.921
And as a wife in future life
She'll hold the horn of plenty

44:01.055 --> 44:05.600
And now a singing bride
Who vocally encompasses

44:05.768 --> 44:11.481
The happiness and harmony
That marriage truly promises

44:28.958 --> 44:37.841
I am the beautiful reflection

44:38.009 --> 44:42.054
Of my love's affection

44:42.221 --> 44:46.558
A walking illustration

44:46.726 --> 44:51.271
Of his adoration

44:51.439 --> 44:54.649
His love makes you beautiful

44:56.486 --> 45:03.283
So beautiful, so beautiful

45:03.701 --> 45:06.453
I ask my looking glass

45:06.621 --> 45:11.208
What is it makes me
So exquisite

45:11.376 --> 45:17.214
The answer to your query
Comes back, dearie

45:17.382 --> 45:20.842
His love makes you beautiful

45:22.595 --> 45:28.308
So beautiful

45:31.854 --> 45:34.898
You are so beautiful

45:37.110 --> 45:41.822
I am so beautiful

45:41.989 --> 45:46.326
You are so beautiful

46:24.323 --> 46:33.331
The most beautiful bride
In the world

46:47.763 --> 46:49.764
My friend the showstopper.

46:49.932 --> 46:52.601
- You could have told me.
- I didn't know about it...

46:52.810 --> 46:55.395
...until I was in my dressing room,
and I saw...

46:56.189 --> 46:57.772
I had to do something.

47:01.652 --> 47:04.321
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much.

47:04.530 --> 47:07.407
It went beautifully.
You were all very good...

47:07.658 --> 47:09.993
...and I am proud of you.

47:18.044 --> 47:20.212
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

47:20.463 --> 47:23.965
- Wonderful, Flo.
- That finale topped everything.

47:25.259 --> 47:27.636
- Mr. Ziegfeld, I...
- Be quiet.

47:27.887 --> 47:29.596
The bride number was wonderful.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.432
Yes, that was fun, wasn't it?

47:36.896 --> 47:38.355
All right, Miss Brice.

47:42.610 --> 47:45.362
- I'm waiting.
- I don't blame you for being mad.

47:45.613 --> 47:48.365
But I didn't do it out of spite.
I didn't plan it.

47:48.574 --> 47:52.035
I was just sitting here and...
"Oh, look. What do you know?"

47:52.286 --> 47:55.080
Because I couldn't do it straight
like those girls.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.665
They would have laughed.

47:56.874 --> 48:00.794
- And they did.
- Yes, but it was my joke. You see?

48:01.045 --> 48:04.881
They laughed with me, not at me.
Because I wanted them to laugh.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.551
But, I mean...
You know what I mean.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.470
No, explain it to me.

48:11.472 --> 48:15.308
- Miss Brice can't see anyone.
- Oh, not even her mama?

48:15.560 --> 48:18.311
- Mama...
- Darling, everybody's talking.

48:18.521 --> 48:19.563
You were wonderful.

48:19.814 --> 48:23.191
You know, we're so proud of you,
we're ready to bust.

48:23.401 --> 48:26.570
Proud, yes. But surprised, no.

48:26.821 --> 48:30.490
- Mr. Ziegfeld, this is my mother.
- Oh, the big boss.

48:30.741 --> 48:34.035
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld.
You have a hit on your hands.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.746
- Especially with my daughter, Fanny.
- Ma.

48:36.914 --> 48:41.126
This is Mrs. Strakosh, our neighbor.
And this is Eddie Ryan. He's my friend.

48:41.335 --> 48:46.089
- Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld. How do you do?
- How do you do?

48:46.299 --> 48:49.301
Mr. Ziegfeld, you're a genius.

48:49.552 --> 48:53.763
To put a beautiful wedding gown
on a girl that's in the family way.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.391
Who would think of such a thing?

48:56.726 --> 48:58.560
Only one person I know.

48:59.020 --> 49:02.272
We'd better go. Mrs. Brice is
expecting half the neighborhood.

49:02.481 --> 49:03.898
Half? All.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.443
Free beer. You come, huh?

49:06.694 --> 49:07.944
Beer?

49:08.529 --> 49:10.363
Mama, I'll come home soon.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.366
Take your time.
I'm gonna be so busy showing off.

49:13.618 --> 49:18.246
How many mothers on Henry Street
are the mother of a Ziegfeld star?

49:18.497 --> 49:20.290
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.

49:26.756 --> 49:30.842
Well, you have a charming mother,
and I have a problem.

49:31.052 --> 49:34.804
I ought to fire you, but I love talent.

49:35.181 --> 49:38.850
And, well, it's hard to quarrel
with five curtain calls.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.435
Six.

49:40.895 --> 49:43.980
Well, there you are.
That's my problem.

49:44.649 --> 49:47.150
So I guess I'll have
to give you another chance.

49:47.318 --> 49:50.070
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!

49:50.655 --> 49:52.947
- Did he fire you?
- Not yet.

49:53.491 --> 49:57.327
But I'll ring the curtain
down on you...

49:57.536 --> 49:59.496
...if you disobey my orders again.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.456
I won't. I won't. Never, ever.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.792
I'll do it straight tomorrow night.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.293
I mean...

50:05.503 --> 50:08.338
...without the pillow.

50:08.631 --> 50:10.757
You'll do it exactly as you did tonight.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.051
- That's an order.
- You mean you liked it?

50:13.219 --> 50:17.806
No! But the audience did. That's why
I'm going to give you another number.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.808
I'll choose a new song for you.

50:20.017 --> 50:24.062
Oh, thank you, Mr. Ziegfeld!
The only thing is, about that song...

50:24.271 --> 50:27.440
I mean, a song, you know,
it's a very, very intimate thing.

50:27.650 --> 50:31.361
I mean, it's really
between me and the audience.

50:31.612 --> 50:32.862
So?

50:33.072 --> 50:38.201
So one of the things I really feel
definite about is choosing my own.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.330
Choosing your own what?

50:42.540 --> 50:43.665
Songs. Songs.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.297
Good evening.

50:51.507 --> 50:54.342
- And congratulations. Both of you.
- Hello, Nick.

50:54.552 --> 50:58.722
- It's you, my first ruffled shirt.
- Good to see you. How are they running?

50:58.931 --> 51:01.683
Oh, ahead, Flo, just like you
and this little girl.

51:01.892 --> 51:05.186
First time I saw her, I had a hunch
you two belonged together.

51:05.354 --> 51:08.106
I have the same hunch.
And it's aging me...

51:09.316 --> 51:10.942
...fast.

51:11.152 --> 51:13.737
I knew it.
It was you who told him about me.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.406
- Afraid not, I wish I had.
- I don't believe you.

51:16.574 --> 51:18.283
Have it your own way.

51:18.492 --> 51:22.245
And you had it your own way
on that stage tonight, didn't you?

51:22.455 --> 51:24.289
Six curtain calls.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.167
Only five.

51:27.460 --> 51:31.671
- But you stopped the show.
- I did! I stopped the Follies!

51:31.881 --> 51:35.508
I knew you would. I wrote the card
with your flowers before the show.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.470
- What?
- The yellow roses.

51:39.847 --> 51:42.640
Oh, I didn't even have
a chance to look!

51:44.393 --> 51:46.811
Oh, they're beautiful.

51:48.022 --> 51:52.734
- "Dear Star, I told you so."
- Don't forget, I saw you work out.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.569
So where would you like to go?

51:54.779 --> 51:57.572
Luchow's? Delmonico's?
A party? Two parties?

51:57.740 --> 52:01.242
- I can't. I gotta meet a gang of people...
- "At my mother's saloon."

52:01.410 --> 52:04.788
- Not again. Can't you skip it?
- No. It wouldn't be nice.

52:04.997 --> 52:07.957
It's sort of a party for me.

52:08.167 --> 52:10.043
- You wanna come?
- I'd love to.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.129
- You mean it?
- Of course.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.673
Think it over.
It's a neighborhood thing.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.259
It might waste
the whole evening for you.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.386
I'll be with you, won't I?

52:25.017 --> 52:26.434
Go ahead, get dressed.

53:03.806 --> 53:07.475
Candidly, Mrs. Brice,
that's a good-looking fellow.

53:07.685 --> 53:13.022
Gorgeous. He reminds me of
Fanny's papa, my ex, also gorgeous.

53:13.232 --> 53:17.151
Wherever he is,
he should only stay there, huh?

53:20.656 --> 53:24.284
What do you do anyway?
I mean, between my opening nights?

53:24.493 --> 53:27.328
- Live.
- Everybody does that.

53:27.538 --> 53:31.499
Hardly anyone does. But I do.
And on the side, I gamble.

53:31.709 --> 53:34.085
You just gamble?

53:34.295 --> 53:36.921
Yes. Like you did tonight.

53:43.804 --> 53:44.971
You married?

53:45.180 --> 53:47.765
No, Mrs. Strakosh, I'm not married.

53:50.978 --> 53:54.439
So you're Mrs. Strakosh's
married daughter, Sadie.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.733
To a dentist.

53:59.403 --> 54:04.449
Oh, Mr. Arnstein, could I interest you
in a friendly little game of poker?

54:04.700 --> 54:06.701
Three-cent limit.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.746
- I was hoping you'd ask me.
- Oh, good.

54:09.955 --> 54:13.666
- Deuces, tens and jokers wild.
- What?

54:14.126 --> 54:16.544
We're out for blood.

54:19.757 --> 54:22.175
- Would you care to deal?
- All right.

54:22.801 --> 54:24.469
Oh, look!

54:25.596 --> 54:26.971
That's marvelous.

54:27.556 --> 54:31.392
I think he's played a game
of poker before, that Mr. Arnstein.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.645
The way he looks to home.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.147
He's a gentleman.

54:36.565 --> 54:40.860
- A gentleman fits in any place.
- A sponge fits in any place.

54:41.111 --> 54:45.323
To me, when a person's a stranger,
they should act a little strange.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.783
I bet.

54:47.159 --> 54:49.494
- Call.
- I call.

55:09.682 --> 55:12.016
I'm afraid you're too good for me.

55:12.393 --> 55:14.727
I see. I got two pair.

55:14.937 --> 55:16.145
Oh, it's yours.

55:16.355 --> 55:19.107
Oh, I win, I win, I win!

55:19.942 --> 55:22.735
- How much do I owe?
- I think 27 cents.

55:22.945 --> 55:25.613
Fine bunch of crooks
I introduced you to.

55:25.781 --> 55:28.658
We had a little more practice, that's all.

55:28.867 --> 55:33.246
Oh, Fanny, darling,
I'm so happy for your success.

55:33.747 --> 55:36.916
- Only one thing could make me happier.
- What?

55:37.126 --> 55:39.335
To dance at your wedding.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.672
Come on, children, sit down.

55:42.923 --> 55:45.466
Talk a little. Settle in.

55:51.265 --> 55:54.892
Should I murder her now
or wait till the party's over?

55:55.102 --> 55:58.187
- Now.
- No, I like her.

55:58.397 --> 56:02.567
Besides, I've been waiting all evening
for a chance to be alone with you.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.360
Where does that go?

56:05.237 --> 56:06.863
It's the alley.

56:08.824 --> 56:10.450
Come.

56:20.252 --> 56:21.294
Alone at last.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.379
Fanny, congratulations!

56:23.589 --> 56:26.966
- Thanks, Mrs. Nadler.
- I had to get up on account of the baby.

56:27.176 --> 56:30.636
- He's a regular midnight fisherman.
- He'll outgrow it.

56:32.598 --> 56:34.390
Alone at last.

56:36.143 --> 56:37.310
That's Henry Street.

56:37.519 --> 56:40.855
You're never alone.
Everybody worries about everybody.

56:41.065 --> 56:43.858
It's my home.
I love having people care about me.

56:44.068 --> 56:48.154
But I don't see how anyone
could help caring about you.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.365
Why, because I'm funny?

56:51.575 --> 56:54.202
Well, that's part of it.

56:57.831 --> 57:02.710
You know, it's a funny thing. I've imagined
you practically all over the world:

57:02.920 --> 57:05.963
Paris, London,
the Delaware Water Gap.

57:06.173 --> 57:10.635
Everyplace. Everyplace except
Henry Street. And here you are.

57:10.844 --> 57:12.762
You've imagined me?

57:13.263 --> 57:16.182
Well, I mean,
I thought about you a lot.

57:16.391 --> 57:18.434
Maybe it was your ruffled shirt.

57:18.644 --> 57:22.980
Anyway, you're like a character
in a book to me.

57:23.232 --> 57:27.777
And I hadn't read many books, see?
So that makes you kind of...

57:28.904 --> 57:31.948
- I talk a lot, don't I?
- Yes.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.910
But it's one of the things
I like best about you.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.579
Boy, have you got good manners.

57:40.958 --> 57:44.043
- It's your turn. Say something.
- All right.

57:44.294 --> 57:49.340
With all these people who care about
you by the blockful and theater-full...

57:49.550 --> 57:53.219
...doesn't it ever narrow down
to just one special person?

57:54.263 --> 57:56.139
You mean, like a boyfriend?

57:57.558 --> 57:59.350
I haven't had time.

57:59.560 --> 58:03.020
But don't get me wrong.
I mean, I know a million guys.

58:03.689 --> 58:06.566
- After all, I am in the theater.
- Oh, yes.

58:08.068 --> 58:12.405
Well, see, I've been very busy and...

58:14.241 --> 58:15.908
How about you?

58:16.410 --> 58:19.287
- Hundreds of girls, huh?
- Oh, thousands!

58:19.496 --> 58:22.915
All gorgeous.

58:23.125 --> 58:25.543
Well, tonight should be
a nice change for you.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.130
It is.

58:37.264 --> 58:38.931
Thousands, wow.

58:39.141 --> 58:41.601
That way, I don't get too involved.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.520
I like to feel free.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.857
You can get lonesome being that free.

58:48.650 --> 58:51.194
You can get lonesome being that busy.

58:53.030 --> 58:56.574
Now, who would think to look at us
that we got the same problem?

58:58.410 --> 59:01.287
We travel single, oh

59:03.832 --> 59:09.295
Maybe we're lucky
But I don't know

59:11.465 --> 59:16.219
With them, just let one kid fall down
And seven mothers faint

59:18.388 --> 59:21.724
I guess we're both happy

59:22.893 --> 59:27.146
But maybe we ain't

59:33.654 --> 59:36.781
People

59:38.450 --> 59:42.495
People who need people

59:44.706 --> 59:49.877
Are the luckiest people

59:50.045 --> 59:55.508
In the world

59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.721
We're children

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:05.810
Needing other children

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:13.442
And yet
Letting our grown-up pride

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:17.905
Hide all the need inside

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:23.494
Acting more like children

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.415
Than children

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:33.963
Lovers

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:38.926
Are very special people

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.933
They're the luckiest people

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:51.147
In the world

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:55.192
With one person

01:00:55.694 --> 01:01:01.032
One very special person

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:06.245
A feeling deep in your soul

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:10.374
Says you were half
Now you're whole

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:14.920
No more hunger and thirst

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:21.260
But first be a person
Who needs people

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:28.434
People who need people

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:36.025
Are the luckiest people

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:48.287
In the world

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:06.180
Fanny, you're an enchanting girl.
I wish I could get to know you better.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.351
So give me six good reasons why not.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.104
Just one.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.607
I have to catch a train for Kentucky
early in the morning.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.861
What's in Kentucky?

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:24.740
Oh, a half interest in a little farm.
I breed horses.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.660
What's the matter,
they can't do it alone?

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:34.333
Hey, you all packed?
So, what are you doing around here?

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.710
It's late. I'll walk you to the car.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.756
- I should go in and say good night.
- It's all right, I'll say it for you.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.180
You know, if you weren't in a show...

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.808
...I think I'd have asked you
to come with me.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.435
Too bad, isn't it?

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.313
I don't know. What with the Follies
and an indecent proposal...

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.315
...it's been quite a night.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.318
It was indecent, wasn't it?

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.945
- Very.
- Oh, thank God.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.240
At least I can tell Mrs. Strakosh
things are looking up.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:11.203
- May I call you when I come back?
- Yeah, sure. When's that?

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:16.667
I don't know exactly. I may go
right on to Europe or the coast...

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:20.504
You see, I never have definite plans.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:23.132
They make me feel too tied down.

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:26.051
But I'll call you.

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.471
Goodbye.

01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:02.690
A feeling deep in your soul

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:07.987
Says you were half
Now you're whole

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:12.658
No more hunger and thirst

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:19.832
But first be a person
Who needs people

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:27.339
People who need people

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:34.597
Are the luckiest people

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:48.235
In the world

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.300
Watch your step.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.927
- Come on down here. Come on.
- Watch your step.

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:17.765
Watch your step.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.267
- Are you the Ziegfeld Girls?
- You can't tell?

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.227
All right, line up over here.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.605
Get over there. Get over there, that's it.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:28.192
Conductor, baby. What time is it,
and where are we?

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:32.905
It's 7 a.m., miss,
and we're in Baltimore.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.782
Baltimore?

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.201
All right, just a second.
Hold it there.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.703
All right, girls, that's it. Smile pretty.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.455
Hold it.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.626
Good. All right, girls.
Hold it, hold it.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.920
Now, where's that new star...

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.422
...Fanny Brice?

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.508
Enter the star.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.134
Miss Brice?

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:57.930
Hold it. Perfect. This'll just
take a minute, Miss Brice.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.810
How about a smile, Miss Brice?

01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:14.196
So shoot the picture.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:15.656
Now.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.033
Oh, very good.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.577
- Great.
- Yes, wasn't it? Terrific. I loved it.

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.372
I'm coming.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:47.896
Fanny! Fanny.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.482
How wonderful to see you.

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.318
And how wonderful you look.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:57.364
You look good too. The first time
I've seen you in broad daylight.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.909
You haven't changed. And I'm glad.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:04.037
- Do you know how long it's been?
- Just a year.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:05.831
And two weeks.

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:09.251
What are you doing here?

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:11.754
I'm waiting for the train
from New York.

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:14.047
- My train?
- That's right.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.259
Fanny, will you have dinner
with me tonight?

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:21.220
Tell me all about Mrs. Strakosh
and about you.

01:08:21.473 --> 01:08:24.850
When a fella gets up at 7 in
the morning to meet a girl's train...

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.978
I came here to meet
another girl, named Elsie.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.149
Good. I have plans,
so you can have dinner with her.

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:34.484
Oh, it'll be very dull.

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:38.863
There she is now.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.831
Thanks, Jack.
I'll see you at the stables.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:51.585
- That's my girl Elsie.
- Skinny legs, just like mine.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.051
How about dinner? Will you, Fanny?

01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:03.095
You always ask me out, don't you?

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.557
Whenever you happen to run into me.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.310
- I've never known anyone so polite.
- Fanny, I...

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:12.981
But I still have other plans.
And I really must go.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.942
Thanks anyway.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:18.111
Oh, Fanny. I can't give up this easily.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:21.823
I wanna see you too much.
We've such a lot to catch up on.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:24.201
Where are you staying? Majestic?

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.287
There's a nice little private
dining room downstairs.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.874
I'll reserve it for 8:00.
I hope you'll change your mind.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.292
I'll be waiting.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.171
No law against waiting.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:38.506
People do it all the time.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.100
"No law against waiting," I said.

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.394
"People do it all the time."

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.564
Should've heard me,
I was a regular Theda Bara.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:57.734
For once in my life, I didn't say
too much, I didn't say too little.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.404
I said just enough, then I walked.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.783
You like these flowers in my hair?

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:08.370
Why should I have dinner with him?
I'm not even hungry.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.830
You like these earrings?

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:13.166
Even if I was hungry,
I don't need him to buy my dinner.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.002
Then why are you going?

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.841
- I said, why...?
- Who said I was going?

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:47.951
Won't you please come in?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.378
May I take your wrap?

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:05.928
That color looks wonderful
with your eyes.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.307
Just my right eye.
I hate what it does to the left.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:21.860
You planning to make advances?

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:30.494
I wasn't planning it,
but it does seem possible.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.665
Before dinner or after dinner?

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.793
You look beautiful.

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:43.423
You don't have to make leading-lady
dialogue for me. I'm a comic.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:46.969
- On-stage.
- That's where I live, on-stage.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:49.471
Then you're missing too much.

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.642
You said we had a lot to catch up on.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:57.771
I'm touring with the Follies.
A week here, then a week in Chicago.

01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:01.191
And then we rehearse a new show
after that. What about you?

01:12:01.401 --> 01:12:04.987
My girl Elsie's running in the
Baltimore Handicap next Friday.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:09.241
- After that, I'm not sure because...
- You never have definite plans.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.951
I remember.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.038
Hey, somebody laid an egg
on your table.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:19.668
- What is it?
- A blue marble egg.

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:21.795
I got it in Rome ages ago.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:26.049
It's one of my favorite things
so I thought you might like to have it.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:35.559
A blue marble egg
and yellow roses...

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.938
You went to a lot of trouble even
though you weren't sure I'd show up.

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.649
I hoped you would.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:46.278
Just as I hope
you like very dry sherry.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.697
I wouldn't know dry from wet.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:19.269
Fanny.

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:21.855
What are you so angry about?

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:27.027
Who's angry?

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:31.865
I'm sorry if I'm disappointing you
in some way, but what did you expect?

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.160
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you so angry?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.413
I am not angry!
Why don't you answer a question?

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:42.417
Should I be flattered because your train
isn't leaving in the morning?

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.670
Oh, this time you have
a few days to kill.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.756
You're not slumming at Keeney's.

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:50.634
- I never was and you know it.
- Don't holler at me!

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.553
- I'm not hollering. You are.
- That's different.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:57.349
I'm a natural hollerer.
Anyway, I answered your silly question.

01:13:57.558 --> 01:14:01.686
Look, why don't we cut through all this
and get to the point, which is:

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:05.649
Why didn't I call you
when I got back from Kentucky?

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.401
Well, you got busy.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:10.654
You forgot.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.989
There could be a hundred reasons.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.825
Just one.

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:18.370
I wanted to stay away from you.

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:28.380
We were heading for something you
couldn't have known how to handle.

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:35.887
What makes you think I do now?

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.933
If you don't...

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.144
...it's time you learned.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:54.447
Maybe we should order now?

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.908
Yeah.

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:07.377
Are you sure you want to stay?

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.339
Well...

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:14.259
...might as well have dinner.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.553
Very sensible.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.847
Come in.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:23.435
Paul, I think we're about ready now.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:25.312
Madame.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.273
Caviar, to begin with?

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.942
No, I don't think so.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.573
Good.

01:15:38.326 --> 01:15:41.786
Then we'll have filet de boeuf,
sauce bordelaise.

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:49.920
Very good, Paul. Thank you.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.673
Very good. Thank you.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.009
All right?

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.887
I would have ordered
roast beef and potatoes.

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:02.015
I did.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:07.771
What's the matter?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.232
If I can't tell
what you're ordering...

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:13.068
...how will I know
when you're making advances?

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:17.030
You'll know.
I'll be much more direct.

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:21.201
You are woman

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.621
I am man

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:28.792
You are smaller

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:32.379
So I can be taller than

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:36.216
You are softer

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:38.718
To the touch

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:46.601
It's a feeling
I like feeling very much

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:52.607
You are someone

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:56.236
I've admired

01:16:56.904 --> 01:17:00.115
Still our friendship

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:03.785
Leaves something
To be desired

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:10.250
Does it take more explanation
Than this?

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:15.797
You are woman, I am man

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.966
Let's kiss

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:32.731
Isn't this the height
Of nonchalance

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:36.776
Furnishing a bed
In restaurants

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:40.030
Well, a bit of dinner
Never hurt

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:44.159
But guess who is
Gonna be dessert

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:47.620
Do good girls do
Just what Mama says

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:51.458
When Mama's not around?
It's a feeling

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.711
Oy, vey, what a feeling

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:58.340
A bit of pâté?
I drink it all day

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:02.469
Should I do the things
He'll tell me to?

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:06.097
In this pickle
What would Sadie do?

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.809
In my soul I feel
An inner lack

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:13.938
Just suppose he wants
His dinner back

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:26.284
Just some dried-out toast in a sliver
On the top a...

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.745
A little chopped liver

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:46.763
How many girls become
A sinner while

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:50.183
Waiting for a roast beef dinner?
Though

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:53.812
Most girls slip
In ordinary ways

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:57.732
I got style
I do it Bordelaise

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.902
Well, at least
You think I'm special

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.363
You ordered à la carte

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:08.743
It's a feeling
I like feeling very

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:12.455
I feel the feeling
Down to my toes

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:16.418
Now I feel that
There's a fire here

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:20.004
Try that once
A little higher, dear

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.800
What a beast
To ruin such a pearl

01:19:23.968 --> 01:19:27.262
Would a convent
Take a Jewish girl?

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:58.460
Does it take more explanation
Than this?

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:09.846
The thrills and chills
Going through me

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:15.018
If I stop him now
Can he sue me?

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:18.938
You are woman

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:22.984
You are man

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:24.777
Let's

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:41.127
I'm calling you. What have you got?

01:20:42.922 --> 01:20:44.881
Ace of diamonds...

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:48.051
...jack of spades, nine of hearts...

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:51.763
...four of clubs and two of diamonds.

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:55.099
Take it. I thought you were bluffing.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:58.853
- I got the pot.
- What do you hear from Fanny?

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:02.232
This morning she telephoned,
long-distance.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.359
- Oh, yeah?
- How did she sound?

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.195
Two shows in a row
and three months on the road.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:09.697
How do you think she sounded? Tired.

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:13.576
- She didn't sound tired.
- Excuse me, I made a mistake.

01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:15.828
She sounded silly, she kept laughing.

01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:18.790
Well, maybe something
strike her comical.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:21.793
A mother says, "How are you?"
That's so comical?

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.419
She breaks out laughing.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:26.381
Another thing.
On the road, she lives like a mouse.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:30.176
All day in the hotel,
all night in the theater, no fresh air.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:33.054
But suddenly in Baltimore, MD,
she's running...

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:37.600
...up streets, down streets, museums,
racetracks, graveyards yet.

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:39.394
Graveyard?

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:43.565
- Do you think it could be a fella?
- Think? I know.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.984
- Who?
- Who is it?

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:49.904
- The ruffled shirt!
- The ruffled shirt.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:22:00.665
Lady, if you're game for this one,
he's on the house.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.501
Nobody in history ever had three.

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.880
Start boiling the water.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.810
I'm proud to think that I'm the man...

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.313
...who introduced you
to your first lobster.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.398
Among other things.

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:28.318
Behave yourself!

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:40.913
I get so mad when I think
of what I missed before I met you.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:47.295
I played Baltimore before, but never
realized it was the most beautiful city.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:50.548
Sort of makes me wish
you'd come with us tomorrow.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.592
See what you can do for Chicago.

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:55.845
I was going to, I decided yesterday.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:58.139
Now I can't.

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:02.685
What happened between
yesterday and now?

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:05.897
You were there.
Elsie lost the Baltimore Handicap.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:07.940
And I lost Elsie and my shirt.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.028
But I was watching you.

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:16.282
You didn't blink an eye.
You didn't lose your ruffled shirt.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.993
No, darling. I never lose that.

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:22.747
Nor my gambling money.
Just about everything else.

01:23:23.082 --> 01:23:24.624
So...

01:23:25.376 --> 01:23:28.127
...I have to take a train
for New York at midnight...

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:30.880
...and the Berengaria for Europe
tomorrow night.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.805
Stop boiling the water.
I just lost my appetite.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.144
- What's in Europe?
- It's what's on the boat to Europe.

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:49.774
A lot of bored men who have nothing
to do for eight days but play cards.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.568
Wait a minute.

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:56.948
You are going to Europe
so you can play cards on the boat?

01:23:57.783 --> 01:24:02.704
Fanny, that's how I live.
I told you that on Henry Street...

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:05.915
...and the first night we were here.
- Yes, I know.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.583
I know.

01:24:07.835 --> 01:24:09.460
I know it by heart.

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:12.380
And...

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.591
...you don't have to worry.
You're not involved.

01:24:15.926 --> 01:24:17.760
But I am involved...

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:24.058
...with a girl who has her own work,
is too busy to get lonesome.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.689
So we wave to each other
from boats and trains.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.402
I better get to the theater.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:41.784
Yes, sir.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.676
Fanny, please don't look sad.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:04.432
You walk back into my life,
change everything and walk out again.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.142
How should I look? Happy?

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:09.353
But I'll be back in your life again, darling.
Very soon.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:10.772
Yeah, like last time.

01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:13.900
- Not a bit like last time.
- So, what's different?

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.777
I love you.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:21.199
Do you mean that?

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:25.995
You're not just trying to be polite?

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:35.379
You do mean it.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:37.256
What do you know?

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:43.721
It's been the most beautiful week
in my whole life.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.897
Fanny, I should hurry
if I'm to drop you, get packed...

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:55.608
...and catch that train for New York.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.069
Well, pick me up at the theater at 11...

01:25:58.237 --> 01:26:00.238
...and I'll go to the station with you.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:03.533
Oh, why not? Are you afraid I'll cry?

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:06.661
No. I'm afraid I will.

01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:40.444
So where have you been
since 6:00 this morning?

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.113
Walking.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:44.615
Just walking.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:48.870
If you're gonna die every time
you say goodbye to a man...

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.372
Calling Miss Brice, Miss Fanny Brice.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:53.165
Right here.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:56.294
- Miss Brice?
- Yeah?

01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:06.971
- You feel better now?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.598
Better.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:14.437
Thank you.

01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:17.565
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:19.358
- Ten dollars?
- Thank you!

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:22.278
From Fanny Brice?
The last of the 5-cent tippers?

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.447
Yeah, I should have made it 20.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.532
Emma. Emma. Where's Emma?

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:28.659
What is it, Fanny?

01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:32.788
I am not going to die. That's all.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:35.124
And I'm not going to Chicago either.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.419
Are you out of your mind?
What are you gonna tell Ziegfeld?

01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:41.881
I'd better find out. Please get him
on the phone for me. Emma.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.133
Where's Emma?
Have you seen Emma?

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:45.843
Where is she? Em?

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:49.889
- Miss Fanny?
- Be an angel and help me. Hold these.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:54.143
I'm only gonna take that bag
and that one. I'm not going to Chicago.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:57.396
What do you mean,
you're not going to Chicago?!

01:27:57.648 --> 01:27:58.814
Where are you going?

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:02.151
- Empire Limited departing for New York...
- Fanny.

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:06.948
...at 8:30 a.m., now boarding at track 14.
- Fanny.

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.658
I told him.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.244
Please talk to her, Miss Georgia.

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:15.581
You can't. Once she makes up her mind,
she makes up her mind.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:17.249
Somebody has to talk to her.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.043
- Who's she talking to?
- Ziegfeld.

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:21.963
You don't need me.
You have four other good names...

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.090
...and the tour is over in two weeks.

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:27.301
- You've said a lot of idiotic things.
- No, Flo.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.720
- That's the most unprofessional...
- Flo!

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:32.890
- I've heard in my entire life!

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:35.351
Hello?

01:28:35.686 --> 01:28:38.354
Will you simmer down before
your ulcer flares up?

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:41.190
Funny coming from you.
You gave me that ulcer.

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:44.318
Now, listen, Flo, I love the theater.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:48.280
I love to hear an audience applaud,
but you can't take an audience home!

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:52.952
I want a personal life too, and I'm gonna
have it. Why not just wish me luck?

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:58.457
She can't walk out in the middle
of the show.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:01.252
She can't stop in the middle...
What did he say?

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:04.755
- He hung up.
- Let me have that phone.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:08.050
Ladies of the ensemble, adieu.

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.177
- Where are you going?
- New York.

01:29:10.387 --> 01:29:12.722
- Why?
- I'm going to Europe with Nick.

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:14.432
- What?
- You're kidding!

01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:17.560
I told you when I meet a guy I want,
I won't make jokes.

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:20.813
Fanny, did Nick ask you
to go with him?

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:23.107
No, but...

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:25.359
...when he sees me, he'll be glad.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.569
I hope.

01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:28.654
Fanny!

01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:35.202
One ticket on the Empire Limited
departing for New York at 8:30 a.m.

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:37.163
Haven't you any pride?

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:40.082
I love the guy, he loves me.
I wanna be with him.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:44.712
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- Georgia, this is right for me.

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:48.257
- Is it right for Nick?
- I'll make it right for him!

01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:52.511
- Don't stick your neck out this way!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

01:29:52.763 --> 01:29:55.848
- Don't. You mustn't do it. Don't quit.
- Don't tell me...

01:29:56.016 --> 01:29:59.101
Don't tell me not to live
Just sit and putter

01:29:59.269 --> 01:30:02.063
Life's candy and the sun's
A ball of butter

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:07.860
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:11.072
Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.991
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:18.621
Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:24.960
I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:30.466
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:35.721
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:38.891
But whether I'm the rose
Of sheer perfection

01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:41.644
A freckle on the nose
Of life's complexion

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:47.858
The cinder or the
Shiny apple of its eye

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:50.945
I got to fly once
I got to try once

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:54.156
Only can die once
Right, sir?

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:57.576
Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy, and you see

01:30:57.744 --> 01:31:00.996
I've got to have my bite, sir

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:04.125
Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a comer

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:07.253
I simply got to march
My heart's a drummer

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:12.925
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.554
I'm going to live and live now

01:31:16.721 --> 01:31:19.807
Get what I want, I know how

01:31:19.975 --> 01:31:22.810
One roll for the whole shebang

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:25.771
One throw, that bell will go clang

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:28.607
Eye on the target and wham

01:31:28.775 --> 01:31:31.986
One shot, one gunshot and bam

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:42.830
Hey, Mr. Arnstein, here I am

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:15.112
I'd march my band out

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.825
I'll beat my drum

01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:23.954
And if I'm fanned out

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:27.041
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.168
Hat, sir, guess I didn't make it

01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:31.921
Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a comer

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:34.131
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:38.135
Nobody, no, nobody

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:43.849
Is going to rain on my

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:58.072
Parade

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.015
Would you like all of these out, sir?

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:33.143
- Oh, no. Just these two, please.
- Thank you, sir.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:52.121
Fanny.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.040
Darling!

01:36:07.429 --> 01:36:09.972
If you hadn't looked
exactly the way you did...

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:13.100
...this could have been
very embarrassing.

01:36:17.147 --> 01:36:19.273
You crazy girl.

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:21.316
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:26.321
...I figured that if I waited for you
to make your fortune...

01:36:26.489 --> 01:36:29.658
...how would you know that I wasn't
after you for your money?

01:36:31.828 --> 01:36:35.080
Nick, I promise I'll never tie you down.
I promise.

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:42.171
Will that be all, sir?

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.716
- Oh, yes, steward. Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:50.220
I say, I caught your show
last time I was in port.

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:51.805
You were simply marvelous.

01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:54.057
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:56.518
Just ring if you need me, Mr. Brice.

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:29.510
Thank you.

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.221
Courvoisier, Mr. Arnstein, right?

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:33.680
Yes, perfect. And a...

01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:37.559
...crème de menthe frappé. All right?
- Yes, sir.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.650
I like that beard on that captain.
It makes him look trustworthy.

01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:47.694
He wants me to bring you
to his cabin for cocktails.

01:37:47.946 --> 01:37:51.198
You're a great success, Fanny,
and that's off-stage.

01:37:51.407 --> 01:37:53.492
I'm with you, that's all.

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.787
Don't know how I thought
of going without you.

01:37:56.955 --> 01:37:58.497
Me neither.

01:37:59.749 --> 01:38:01.833
- Nick...
- Yes?

01:38:02.418 --> 01:38:03.919
Go on, say it.

01:38:04.546 --> 01:38:08.090
Well, you went to good schools.
I went to practically no schools.

01:38:08.341 --> 01:38:09.424
You're Park Avenue.

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:13.095
- I'm Lower East Side.
- Now, now. Don't be a snob.

01:38:13.763 --> 01:38:18.433
No, no. What I am trying to say is...

01:38:18.685 --> 01:38:22.896
And you don't have to...
I mean, I'm all yours anyway, but...

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:27.359
Well, where I come from
on Henry Street...

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:32.906
...when two people
sort of love each other...

01:38:35.785 --> 01:38:37.494
Oh, never mind, never mind.

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:42.916
Well, what do they do
when they sort of love each other?

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:49.423
One of them says,
"Why don't we get married?"

01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.466
Is that so?

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:56.054
- And sometimes it's even the man.
- Really?

01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:59.725
Look, forget the whole thing.
Just forget I mentioned it.

01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:01.268
All right.

01:39:01.603 --> 01:39:03.353
Thank you.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.273
You know...

01:39:06.733 --> 01:39:09.401
...it's pretty much the same
where I come from.

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:16.491
Well, why don't you stop making jokes
and say it so that I can say...

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:20.662
...I have to think it over,
or ask my mother, or turn you down.

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:22.956
I've got a better idea.

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:24.625
What's that?

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:28.170
- Have your drink.
- Have my drink.

01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:32.758
Look, why don't we get married?

01:39:35.762 --> 01:39:37.971
When? Here? Tonight? When?

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:40.140
The captain looks like a rabbi.

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:43.518
- How? When? Tonight? Right now?
- When I make a bankroll.

01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:45.937
- No, I don't care about that.
- I do.

01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:49.691
- I intend to be the head of this family.
- You will. You're smarter.

01:39:49.942 --> 01:39:52.361
It'll be the way I say or not at all.

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:56.323
Well, could you win what you need
in that poker game tonight?

01:39:56.616 --> 01:39:59.034
- It's possible.
- Go ahead, go play cards.

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:00.869
- Wait.
- I wanna be a Sadie.

01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:03.038
A what?

01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:07.000
You met Mrs. Strakosh's
married daughter, Sadie.

01:40:07.168 --> 01:40:09.836
- That's a married lady.
- I see.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:12.589
Can I come and watch with you?

01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:17.386
Look, my whole future
depends on it. Please!

01:40:20.556 --> 01:40:23.141
Can you watch
with no expression at all?

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:25.310
Whatever happens?

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.107
Can I watch with no expression?

01:40:31.526 --> 01:40:33.026
I pass.

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:36.571
I'll call.

01:40:38.324 --> 01:40:41.243
- I call.
- I pass.

01:40:41.494 --> 01:40:42.577
Call.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:44.079
I'll call.

01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:46.164
Cards?

01:40:46.708 --> 01:40:49.668
Just one, please. Thank you.

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:54.589
Three here.

01:40:54.799 --> 01:40:56.049
Three.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.885
- Two.
- Two.

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:01.388
The dealer takes three.

01:41:04.684 --> 01:41:06.393
Up to the opener.

01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.023
Opener checks.

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.611
I'll bet a thousand.

01:41:20.199 --> 01:41:21.408
I'm out.

01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:28.915
All right.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.043
One thousand and...

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:35.172
...two thousand more.

01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:40.177
I'm out.

01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:58.111
Well, I think you are bluffing,
Mr. Arnstein.

01:42:06.287 --> 01:42:07.913
So I'll see you.

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:10.874
Well, I've got three kings here.

01:42:15.505 --> 01:42:20.091
- I thought you were bluffing.
- In this distinguished company?

01:42:20.343 --> 01:42:21.468
I wouldn't dare.

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:27.098
I'm afraid this is getting
rather dull for you, darling.

01:42:27.475 --> 01:42:29.476
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

01:42:29.727 --> 01:42:31.686
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.943
Quit, quit, quit!

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:41.905
It's against my religion
to break a winning streak.

01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:46.701
Goodbye, Sadie.

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:51.498
Sorry, gentlemen.

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:54.209
Your deal.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.860
What happened?

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:23.405
It's a beautiful night.

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:27.075
I had a stroll around the deck.
It did me a lot of good.

01:43:27.326 --> 01:43:28.827
Nick!

01:43:32.665 --> 01:43:36.543
It's terribly late, Sadie.
You should have been in bed ages ago.

01:43:36.878 --> 01:43:41.131
How could I go to bed?! I've been
sitting here waiting, hour after hour.

01:43:47.346 --> 01:43:49.806
Did you say "Sadie"?

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:08.158
Mrs. Arnstein, Mrs. Arnstein

01:44:08.326 --> 01:44:14.122
What a beautiful, beautiful name

01:44:22.924 --> 01:44:29.554
Sadie, Sadie, married lady

01:44:29.972 --> 01:44:34.893
See what's on my hand

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:42.108
There's nothing quite as touching

01:44:42.818 --> 01:44:48.740
As a simple wedding band

01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:53.578
Oh, how that
Marriage license works

01:44:53.871 --> 01:44:57.457
On chambermaids and hotel clerks

01:44:57.625 --> 01:45:01.670
The honeymoon was such delight

01:45:01.837 --> 01:45:05.757
That we got married that same night

01:45:05.925 --> 01:45:11.012
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.556
Sadie, you did the trick

01:45:14.642 --> 01:45:18.937
Not every girl can get herself

01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:22.232
A guy who looks like Nick

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:27.737
To tell the truth
It hurt my pride

01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:32.617
The groom was prettier
Than the bride

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:37.205
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady
That's me

01:45:45.047 --> 01:45:49.175
We're sailing home
So, Rosie, dear

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:53.179
Bring chicken soup
Down to the pier

01:45:53.347 --> 01:45:57.851
Sadie, Sadie, married lady
That's me

01:46:16.662 --> 01:46:20.749
Honey, if this is a hotel,
I don't think they're ready for us.

01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:24.002
Oh, Nick.

01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:26.588
Oh, Nick!

01:46:26.839 --> 01:46:28.506
It must have cost a fortune.

01:46:28.758 --> 01:46:31.217
Well, I made a fortune
on the Epsom Derby.

01:46:31.594 --> 01:46:35.764
I expect to make another with this Florida
deal. There's nothing to worry about.

01:46:36.432 --> 01:46:39.476
Who's worried? Anyway,
it's the perfect house for a millionaire.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:42.312
And for Sadie, Sadie

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.980
Married lady

01:46:44.607 --> 01:46:47.442
Meet a mortgagee

01:46:47.985 --> 01:46:51.112
The owner of an icebox

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.199
With a 10-year guarantee

01:46:55.159 --> 01:46:59.162
Oh, sit me in the softest seat

01:46:59.497 --> 01:47:02.916
Quick, a cushion for my feet

01:47:03.084 --> 01:47:07.170
Do for me, buy for me
Lift me, carry me

01:47:07.338 --> 01:47:10.465
Finally got a guy to marry me

01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:14.052
I do my nails, read up on sales

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.555
All day the records play

01:47:17.723 --> 01:47:21.142
Then he comes home, I tell him

01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:24.813
"Oy, what a day I had today"

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:29.109
I swear I'll do my wifely job

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:32.946
Just sit at home, become a slob

01:47:39.036 --> 01:47:44.082
A husband, a house

01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:50.380
And a beautiful reflection

01:47:50.548 --> 01:47:56.177
Of my love's affection

01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:59.639
Sadie, Sadie

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:05.770
Married lady

01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:07.897
That's me

01:48:17.408 --> 01:48:21.202
Nice baby. Open your eyes,
look at your daddy.

01:48:24.123 --> 01:48:25.790
Baby.

01:48:28.794 --> 01:48:30.211
I bought her something.

01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:33.923
- An add-a-pearl necklace.
- An add-a-tooth necklace would be...

01:48:34.133 --> 01:48:36.926
Nick, you are absolutely crazy.

01:48:37.178 --> 01:48:39.596
She can't wear this
until she's grown up.

01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:42.682
But she'll know she has it.
It'll give her confidence.

01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:45.393
Besides, if you play your cards right...

01:48:45.644 --> 01:48:47.687
...she might loan it to you until then.

01:48:47.938 --> 01:48:51.107
You bet she will. Won't you?

01:48:51.317 --> 01:48:53.193
- Fifteen. One more.
- Oh, please!

01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:55.195
Sixteen.

01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:58.448
Look at me.
I'm breathing like a whale.

01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:01.868
The way that baby slowed me down,
I ought to sue her.

01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:03.578
She's so pretty, isn't she?

01:49:03.829 --> 01:49:06.581
Frances? She's the cutest little thing
I ever saw.

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:09.584
- Alive, alert...
- But she's pretty.

01:49:10.127 --> 01:49:14.297
Yes, Fan, she's pretty.
Very pretty. Come on.

01:49:14.548 --> 01:49:17.091
Ziegfeld made no mistake hiring you.

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.677
Heard from Nick lately?

01:49:19.929 --> 01:49:22.805
- Yeah, he calls me every night.
- From Oklahoma?

01:49:23.015 --> 01:49:26.309
Sure. With the phone bills
we're getting, he better strike oil.

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:29.354
Come on, let's try this.

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.064
Let's go.

01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:39.364
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, four.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:00.677
Nick!

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:09.435
I can't believe it.

01:50:12.314 --> 01:50:14.649
- There you are.
- Thank you very much.

01:50:14.858 --> 01:50:17.777
Is that ghastly sound
coming from my daughter?

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:22.156
What is it, honey?
What is it, sweetheart? Are you wet?

01:50:22.408 --> 01:50:25.159
- Welcome home, Mr. Arnstein.
- It's good to see you.

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:28.121
What happened?
What happened to the baby?

01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:31.708
- Look who's here, honey.
- Frances, that isn't very attractive.

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:33.042
So I wish you'd stop.

01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:37.338
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:50:38.799 --> 01:50:41.175
Why, you've stayed blond,
you clever girl.

01:50:41.385 --> 01:50:44.053
Miss Fanny, we're going
to be late for rehearsal.

01:50:44.263 --> 01:50:46.222
Oh, just a few more minutes.

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:48.516
Would you take the baby
to Hilda for me?

01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:51.644
- Sure.
- Goodbye, my love.

01:50:51.895 --> 01:50:53.646
Say bye-bye.

01:50:58.110 --> 01:50:59.485
You know what?

01:51:00.738 --> 01:51:03.656
This time I think maybe
you lost your ruffled shirt.

01:51:06.243 --> 01:51:09.912
We struck sand and rock and water.

01:51:10.247 --> 01:51:12.290
I think we even struck champagne.

01:51:12.458 --> 01:51:14.751
The one thing
we didn't strike was oil.

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:17.128
Well, you'll think of something better...

01:51:17.296 --> 01:51:20.757
...while lying in a hammock
at your beautiful country house.

01:51:24.261 --> 01:51:25.595
It is beautiful, isn't it?

01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:33.895
Nick, it's been absolutely murder...

01:51:34.146 --> 01:51:37.440
...dragging myself back and forth
to that theater every day.

01:51:39.651 --> 01:51:41.402
You guessed it.

01:51:42.946 --> 01:51:45.615
We better start looking
for an apartment in town...

01:51:45.783 --> 01:51:48.993
...on 5th Avenue.
- Even on 6th. I wouldn't be insulted.

01:51:49.161 --> 01:51:52.205
You know what bothers me
even more than losing the house?

01:51:52.373 --> 01:51:55.583
It's the fact that I seem
to have lost my poker face.

01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:58.920
Just to me, honey. Come on.

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:07.929
Place your come bets. Eight eats five.

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.851
Coming out. Seven away, eight alive.

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:22.026
New shooter.

01:52:22.694 --> 01:52:24.987
- Nick.
- Tom.

01:52:25.239 --> 01:52:27.073
Hey, the place looks wonderful.

01:52:27.324 --> 01:52:31.369
As you said, a church can look cute,
but a gambling house has to look honest.

01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:33.329
And be honest.

01:52:33.539 --> 01:52:35.039
Come on in here.

01:52:35.374 --> 01:52:38.584
Oh, Joe, a Scotch and water
for Mr. Arnstein.

01:52:39.378 --> 01:52:40.920
Well, when did you get back?

01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:43.339
Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

01:52:44.049 --> 01:52:45.633
It's good to see you, Tom.

01:52:45.884 --> 01:52:48.553
Well, what took you
so long to drop in?

01:52:48.804 --> 01:52:51.764
Well, we've been moving
into a new apartment in town.

01:52:51.932 --> 01:52:53.808
I've been helping with the legwork.

01:52:53.976 --> 01:52:56.686
My wife has a show opening tonight.

01:52:57.187 --> 01:53:01.065
Say, Nick, I was sorry to hear
about those oil wells.

01:53:03.318 --> 01:53:05.445
Is it all over town, Tom?

01:53:05.946 --> 01:53:07.947
Even made the papers.

01:53:08.157 --> 01:53:10.366
Oh, but that doesn't mean anything.

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:12.326
It's funny, though.

01:53:12.703 --> 01:53:14.495
I once dropped 20,000 on Monday...

01:53:14.663 --> 01:53:18.458
...picked up 30 on Tuesday,
all in absolute privacy.

01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:20.918
The news travels
much faster these days.

01:53:22.087 --> 01:53:24.881
That spotlight on your wife
lights you up too.

01:53:31.930 --> 01:53:36.309
- Any action in the backroom?
- Now? Yeah, there's a game, but...

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.768
Nick.

01:53:38.896 --> 01:53:42.356
Just by way of limbering up.
Besides, I've got an hour to kill.

01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:45.067
I hear they haven't been
running too well.

01:53:45.611 --> 01:53:47.361
It'll change.

01:53:50.741 --> 01:53:52.074
He's not in his seat.

01:53:52.284 --> 01:53:55.495
I looked down during the number.
He's not in his seat.

01:53:55.704 --> 01:53:59.790
So maybe the guy's late, ran into
an old friend or his watch stopped.

01:54:00.042 --> 01:54:04.045
- You're getting excited over nothing.
- Nothing? People get run over.

01:54:04.213 --> 01:54:06.214
They have accidents, don't they?

01:54:06.465 --> 01:54:10.551
Emma, go call the hospitals.
I mean, he could be lying in a street.

01:54:10.719 --> 01:54:13.012
Where's my eyeliner?
Do you see my eyeliner?

01:54:13.222 --> 01:54:15.306
Hurry up and get dressed, will you?

01:54:19.645 --> 01:54:21.771
I'll call 300.

01:54:28.278 --> 01:54:30.154
Five hundred. Bettor.

01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:00.977
No, not for me.

01:55:11.697 --> 01:55:16.200
Have a bite. Keep your strength up.
Food and liquor right over there.

01:55:22.291 --> 01:55:24.875
Nick, it's after 9:00.

01:55:25.544 --> 01:55:27.253
Why don't you get out?

01:55:27.462 --> 01:55:29.630
No, Tom. Thank you. I'll watch it.

01:55:29.881 --> 01:55:34.969
Telephone for you, Mr. Arnstein, in the
bar. It's your wife's maid at the theater.

01:55:36.263 --> 01:55:40.266
Well, look, tell her...
Tell her I've been detained.

01:55:40.517 --> 01:55:44.186
I'll be there in time
for the second act. Thank you.

01:56:56.218 --> 01:56:58.594
What are you gonna do?
Shoot the swans?

01:56:58.887 --> 01:57:00.179
These lovelies?

01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:03.182
My swan girls?
What are you, dumb?

01:57:03.642 --> 01:57:06.644
Can't you see
When you look at me

01:57:06.812 --> 01:57:10.022
What a lovely creature is a swan
Yoo-hoo

01:57:10.232 --> 01:57:13.484
I'm all over fluffy white
I wouldn't peck at you or bite

01:57:13.652 --> 01:57:16.487
And have teeny twinkle toes
To dance upon

01:57:21.118 --> 01:57:22.660
Oh, was that good!

01:57:26.081 --> 01:57:28.165
Prince!

01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:30.376
Was that necessary?

01:57:30.585 --> 01:57:33.087
You couldn't walk over here
like a person?

01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:36.465
Where was I? Oh, I was here.

01:57:36.758 --> 01:57:41.220
So you just

01:57:41.388 --> 01:57:44.682
Gotta have a swan
Or you're out of luck

01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:48.352
'Cause a chicken wouldn't do
It would only cluck

01:57:48.603 --> 01:57:51.105
And besides you couldn't say

01:57:51.857 --> 01:57:54.024
"I saw Chicken Lake ballet"

01:57:54.192 --> 01:57:56.527
They would think you don't know nothin'
You are missing here a button

01:57:56.695 --> 01:57:59.488
'Cause a chicken's
Only good for consommé

01:57:59.948 --> 01:58:04.034
Whereupon, whereupon
Whereupon, whereupon

01:58:04.202 --> 01:58:07.288
A chicken or a duck
Is a mistake

01:58:07.873 --> 01:58:14.044
When you do Swan Lake
Swan Lake

02:00:07.826 --> 02:00:09.618
I'm sorry, darling.

02:00:13.957 --> 02:00:15.666
How did it go?

02:00:18.503 --> 02:00:20.045
Good reviews?

02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:35.060
"All any show needs is Fanny Brice."

02:00:38.273 --> 02:00:42.568
"New York audiences continue
their love affair with Fanny."

02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:45.905
Darling, I'm so happy for you.

02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:58.000
How was the party?

02:00:58.919 --> 02:01:01.128
There was no party.

02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:06.550
The guests didn't think the hostess
was in the mood for a party.

02:01:07.218 --> 02:01:09.261
Not without the host.

02:01:09.721 --> 02:01:11.513
Look, let's not fight about this.

02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:13.223
Why not?

02:01:13.934 --> 02:01:17.186
Isn't your spoiling my opening night
worth fighting about?

02:01:17.938 --> 02:01:21.148
How do you think I felt out there,
trying to be funny?

02:01:22.317 --> 02:01:24.318
I'm trying to make them laugh.

02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:27.821
My own husband
not caring enough to be there!

02:01:28.156 --> 02:01:30.741
You didn't let your audience suffer
because of me.

02:01:30.909 --> 02:01:32.785
You're damn right I didn't.

02:01:32.994 --> 02:01:37.289
But how do you think I felt afterwards,
with people asking me where you were?

02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:41.585
What could I say? A poker game was
more important than my opening night?!

02:01:41.795 --> 02:01:43.712
To hell with your opening night!

02:01:43.964 --> 02:01:47.925
Why shouldn't the poker game
be as important as your opening night?

02:01:48.176 --> 02:01:51.929
It's my work, and I haven't
had a smash hit for a long time.

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:56.016
But tonight I was winning. I wouldn't
have left that game for anything...

02:01:56.184 --> 02:02:01.188
...because I thought maybe, finally,
at last my luck had changed.

02:02:05.110 --> 02:02:06.819
Only it hadn't.

02:02:12.701 --> 02:02:14.743
So it'll change tomorrow.

02:02:16.121 --> 02:02:18.706
The way it has a hundred other times.

02:02:21.626 --> 02:02:25.587
Everyone has a run of bad luck
now and then. It doesn't mean anything.

02:02:27.215 --> 02:02:29.550
How would you know, darling?

02:02:29.884 --> 02:02:31.635
You never lose.

02:02:57.787 --> 02:02:59.788
That was my crazy husband
on the phone.

02:02:59.956 --> 02:03:03.584
A guy with a deal for me offered
Nick a thousand to put in a word.

02:03:03.752 --> 02:03:08.547
He took the thousand and gave it
to a waiter he never saw before in his life.

02:03:09.007 --> 02:03:11.258
And he just put in a word.

02:03:21.895 --> 02:03:23.562
You wanna play? Get a deck.

02:03:26.441 --> 02:03:30.652
Fanny, I never butted
in your life, did I?

02:03:32.155 --> 02:03:35.657
Sure. When I was a kid, you made me
wear long underwear to school.

02:03:35.909 --> 02:03:38.744
When your children grow up
and you wanna talk serious...

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:40.996
...I hope they make jokes.
- I'm sorry.

02:03:41.164 --> 02:03:43.749
I just thought you were gonna
start in on Nick.

02:03:44.334 --> 02:03:48.170
Where would I come to criticize Nick?
It's you I'm surprised at.

02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:52.758
Why?

02:03:53.009 --> 02:03:57.971
Because when you look at him,
you only see what you want to see.

02:03:58.306 --> 02:04:01.266
I see him as he is. I love him as he is.

02:04:01.476 --> 02:04:03.727
Fanny, love him a little less.

02:04:03.978 --> 02:04:05.771
Help him a little more.

02:04:07.649 --> 02:04:11.443
Mama, he doesn't need any help.
He's not a child.

02:04:11.694 --> 02:04:14.071
The man is drowning.
He owes money everywhere.

02:04:14.239 --> 02:04:16.949
He doesn't know which way to turn.

02:04:18.743 --> 02:04:20.285
What?

02:04:21.371 --> 02:04:25.791
- How do you know that?
- Everybody knows. Only you don't know.

02:04:26.668 --> 02:04:31.338
Fanny, are you so wrapped up in
the show, you can't see anything else?

02:04:31.631 --> 02:04:36.051
Why wouldn't he tell me? He knows
he can have anything I've got.

02:04:36.511 --> 02:04:38.262
That's not what he needs.

02:04:38.513 --> 02:04:39.930
Darling, you are his wife.

02:04:40.098 --> 02:04:43.016
You've gotta sit down with him,
talk to him...

02:04:43.226 --> 02:04:45.686
...think together what he should do.

02:05:01.703 --> 02:05:03.495
Some of that for me, Nick?

02:05:03.663 --> 02:05:06.039
Won't make a dent
in what I owe you, Peterson.

02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:10.919
- But if you can't wait...
- Hey. I could wait. I could even forget it.

02:05:11.921 --> 02:05:13.839
In return for what?

02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:18.719
I need a front man,
someone like you...

02:05:18.928 --> 02:05:22.472
...who can talk, for a bond deal
I'm putting together.

02:05:22.682 --> 02:05:23.849
It's a big one, Nick.

02:05:24.058 --> 02:05:28.228
- You could make yourself a mint.
- Thanks, but I don't think so.

02:05:28.438 --> 02:05:31.648
Okay. I guess when you have
Fanny Brice for a meal ticket...

02:05:31.858 --> 02:05:34.484
...you don't get very hungry. Nicky.

02:05:34.652 --> 02:05:36.486
Hey.

02:05:37.739 --> 02:05:39.907
I'm sorry, Peterson.

02:05:41.242 --> 02:05:42.701
Meal tickets...

02:05:42.911 --> 02:05:44.703
...that's my joke.

02:05:45.747 --> 02:05:47.206
Sure.

02:05:56.674 --> 02:05:58.091
Boo!

02:06:00.136 --> 02:06:01.553
Is Mr. Branca here yet?

02:06:01.763 --> 02:06:04.723
- Not yet, Mr. Arnstein.
- Well, I expect him any minute.

02:06:04.933 --> 02:06:07.226
This yelled through the window
of FAO Schwarz:

02:06:07.435 --> 02:06:10.312
"Take me home to Frances,"
it said. So I did.

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:14.691
- Will you give it to her for me? Thank you.
- Yes, Mr. Arnstein.

02:06:14.901 --> 02:06:17.402
- Oh, Hilda.
- Yes?

02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:21.657
You and the cook have been very patient,
but it's time I paid your salaries.

02:06:21.866 --> 02:06:24.409
I owe you for two months, I believe.

02:06:24.619 --> 02:06:29.373
Miss Brice paid us, sir. All that was owed
and three months in advance.

02:06:29.582 --> 02:06:32.292
I mean, Mrs. Arnstein paid us.

02:06:32.502 --> 02:06:34.544
Miss Brice paid you.

02:06:37.298 --> 02:06:39.132
I'll get it, thank you.

02:06:41.386 --> 02:06:42.928
- There you are.
- Am I late?

02:06:43.179 --> 02:06:46.181
No, I just beat you in.
Let's go in here.

02:06:46.349 --> 02:06:49.309
I'll mix us a drink.
You tell me what you have in mind.

02:06:49.477 --> 02:06:50.936
All right.

02:06:51.104 --> 02:06:52.688
Hey, nice place, Nick.

02:06:52.897 --> 02:06:55.607
It's comfortable and very convenient.

02:06:55.858 --> 02:06:59.486
- Water or soda, Tom?
- Straight. Look, I haven't got much time.

02:06:59.737 --> 02:07:02.572
The place is getting crowded
earlier these days.

02:07:02.782 --> 02:07:05.158
When you do that well,
it's called good trouble.

02:07:05.326 --> 02:07:08.537
- That's what I want to talk to you about.
- Nick.

02:07:08.705 --> 02:07:11.665
- I didn't know you were home.
- Hello, darling.

02:07:11.874 --> 02:07:14.042
Mr. Branca, I haven't
seen you for ages.

02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:17.754
I've been dying to see your show,
Mrs. Arnstein, but I've been so busy.

02:07:17.922 --> 02:07:20.507
I just dropped by
to make Nick a little proposition.

02:07:20.717 --> 02:07:24.177
Well, if it's some new way
of marking cards, Nick, don't listen.

02:07:24.345 --> 02:07:27.723
Aside from that, I'll leave you.
Although I'm dying of curiosity.

02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:31.768
Come back, silly.
Get yourself a drink and sit down.

02:07:31.978 --> 02:07:35.314
- All right with you, Tom?
- Of course. It's all in the family.

02:07:35.523 --> 02:07:39.609
- Then sit down and start propositioning.
- All right.

02:07:41.946 --> 02:07:44.656
Well, as I told you, the place...

02:07:44.907 --> 02:07:47.951
No, thanks.
The place is doing awfully well.

02:07:48.119 --> 02:07:50.495
So well that a couple money men
approached me...

02:07:50.663 --> 02:07:55.042
...about opening another one on the
East Side. It's getting very fashionable.

02:07:55.877 --> 02:07:58.003
I'd like to, Nick. I think it would go.

02:07:58.212 --> 02:08:01.506
But I can't possibly run
two places single-handed.

02:08:01.674 --> 02:08:04.676
Those people don't know the first thing
about this business.

02:08:04.886 --> 02:08:06.678
So I told them about you.

02:08:06.888 --> 02:08:10.140
And the long and the short of it is,
we want you to be a partner.

02:08:10.308 --> 02:08:13.894
With an extra cut for running
the place. How's it strike you?

02:08:14.103 --> 02:08:17.272
Pleasantly. I'm flattered, naturally.

02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:21.193
And it's no secret
there's no place I'd rather be...

02:08:21.402 --> 02:08:23.070
...than a gambling club.

02:08:23.279 --> 02:08:25.697
Except the theater on opening night.

02:08:27.825 --> 02:08:30.243
It does sound like something
you'd be good at.

02:08:30.453 --> 02:08:33.747
I've always had a little yen to run a club.
And lots of ideas.

02:08:34.082 --> 02:08:38.210
- Well, then, great. Then it's a deal.
- Wait, wait a minute.

02:08:39.295 --> 02:08:44.508
It depends on how much I'd have to
put up for the partnership, because...

02:08:44.717 --> 02:08:48.637
Nick, we don't need your money.
We need you.

02:08:49.305 --> 02:08:52.015
Well, how much are you
and the others putting in?

02:08:53.184 --> 02:08:54.893
Fifty thousand.

02:08:55.812 --> 02:08:58.021
And for me it's free?

02:08:58.523 --> 02:09:01.858
Tom, I can't let you put up my share.

02:09:02.402 --> 02:09:05.112
I'm not. I swear I'm not.

02:09:05.363 --> 02:09:09.699
Look, our thinking is that
with your know-how and your...

02:09:09.951 --> 02:09:12.452
...well, class is the only
word I can use...

02:09:12.703 --> 02:09:16.998
...you'll attract all the right people.
We'll make our money back in no time.

02:09:21.337 --> 02:09:26.091
Full partnership for nothing?
Oh, except my class.

02:09:26.342 --> 02:09:29.094
Plus a cut for running the place.

02:09:29.512 --> 02:09:32.013
That's a very generous offer.

02:09:34.392 --> 02:09:36.184
Too generous.

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:40.981
Fanny...

02:09:44.068 --> 02:09:46.403
...how much were you going to put in?

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.622
Fifty thousand.

02:10:12.305 --> 02:10:15.182
Tom, I'm sorry
your time's been wasted.

02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:19.311
- Nick, it is a good idea.
- Was a good idea.

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:23.106
Please don't blame Tom.
I talked him into it.

02:10:24.650 --> 02:10:26.443
Thanks for everything.

02:10:51.219 --> 02:10:53.011
Nick.

02:10:56.057 --> 02:10:59.684
- I was just trying to help.
- I don't want that kind of help!

02:10:59.894 --> 02:11:02.395
I don't want anyone
going around behind my back...

02:11:02.605 --> 02:11:05.649
...sinking money into me
to make me look good.

02:11:06.692 --> 02:11:08.360
Fanny, I...

02:11:10.947 --> 02:11:13.198
I just wish you hadn't done it.

02:11:15.117 --> 02:11:18.995
You'd better go.
You'll be late for the theater.

02:11:20.206 --> 02:11:25.043
I... I can't go. Not like this.

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.671
Darling, listen. Please.

02:11:28.839 --> 02:11:31.550
Once I saw how unhappy you are...

02:11:31.801 --> 02:11:35.303
...I knew I had to do something.
I guess I did it wrong.

02:11:35.471 --> 02:11:37.264
- You know how dumb I can be.
- Fanny.

02:11:37.431 --> 02:11:40.100
You don't have to tell me
that you did it out of love.

02:11:40.268 --> 02:11:42.143
Believe me, I know that.

02:12:53.966 --> 02:12:56.384
Murray Hill 4119.

02:13:00.222 --> 02:13:01.598
Peterson?

02:13:03.934 --> 02:13:05.352
Arnstein.

02:13:34.757 --> 02:13:36.216
Something wrong?

02:13:38.552 --> 02:13:39.969
It's Nick.

02:13:41.639 --> 02:13:42.764
He's hurt?

02:13:42.973 --> 02:13:45.600
No, no. He's in trouble.

02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:49.354
He's gotten himself mixed up
in a phony bond deal.

02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:55.944
So, what do I do?

02:13:56.195 --> 02:13:59.406
- I call a lawyer or...?
- No, he's got a lawyer.

02:13:59.657 --> 02:14:01.658
Branca got him Bill Fallon.

02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:06.037
And Fallon's the best criminal attorney
in New York City.

02:14:06.789 --> 02:14:07.831
Criminal?

02:14:09.375 --> 02:14:13.336
Fanny, embezzlement
is a criminal charge.

02:14:13.546 --> 02:14:18.550
Now, Fallon advised him to give
himself up, and he did. A few hours ago.

02:14:20.344 --> 02:14:21.928
He gave himself up?

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:30.019
You mean he's in jail?

02:14:30.604 --> 02:14:32.772
Nick.

02:14:35.484 --> 02:14:36.526
I've gotta see him.

02:14:36.694 --> 02:14:39.195
You can't, honey. They won't let you.

02:14:39.655 --> 02:14:41.072
- I just gotta.
- Look...

02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:44.868
- Miss Fanny, is there something I can do?
- Fanny. Fanny. Fanny, look.

02:14:46.078 --> 02:14:49.456
He... He doesn't want to see you.

02:14:49.623 --> 02:14:52.459
It's understandable, dear.
The man's humiliated, ashamed.

02:14:52.626 --> 02:14:55.754
Ashamed of what?
This is Nick Arnstein, not some hood!

02:14:55.963 --> 02:14:59.215
If these bonds were phony,
you don't think he knew it, do you?

02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:05.180
That's the line Fallon is going to use,
that he was a victim, a dupe.

02:15:05.389 --> 02:15:08.224
- Fallon's going to call you at home.
- I'd better go then.

02:15:08.392 --> 02:15:10.894
There are a bunch of reporters
at that stage door.

02:15:11.061 --> 02:15:14.856
Now, come on up to my office and
go out through the front of the house.

02:15:15.775 --> 02:15:19.027
Why? There's nothing to hide.

02:15:19.612 --> 02:15:21.529
You want me to go with you, Fan?

02:15:21.822 --> 02:15:23.198
No.

02:15:37.338 --> 02:15:38.588
Miss Brice.

02:15:38.756 --> 02:15:42.425
- Will you answer a few questions?
- Sure, but I don't talk very good yet.

02:15:42.593 --> 02:15:43.635
Hold that pose!

02:15:43.803 --> 02:15:45.804
Did you know Nick
would give himself up?

02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:48.306
He'll do anything not to
come home for dinner.

02:15:48.516 --> 02:15:52.143
Peterson says Nick masterminded
the whole swindle. What do you say?

02:15:52.311 --> 02:15:56.147
Nick. He couldn't mastermind
an electric light bulb out of a socket!

02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.024
Fanny, what about these stocks?

02:15:58.234 --> 02:16:00.902
Stock? The only stock I know about
is summer stock.

02:16:01.070 --> 02:16:03.446
- What's your husband's story?
- There's no story.

02:16:03.656 --> 02:16:07.992
My dope was an innocent dupe!
Or my dupe was an innocent dope?

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.496
- Did he try to sell you any bonds?
- That much of a dope, he ain't.

02:16:11.664 --> 02:16:16.251
- You realize he might go to prison?
- At least I'll know where he is nights.

02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:18.461
You still love him, Miss Brice?

02:16:19.046 --> 02:16:20.797
The name is Arnstein.

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:22.841
Mrs. Arnstein.

02:16:23.342 --> 02:16:25.760
Mrs. Arnstein, do you still love him?

02:16:56.165 --> 02:16:57.666
Next case.

02:16:57.959 --> 02:16:59.502
"The People v. Arnstein.

02:16:59.712 --> 02:17:02.338
The grand jury has
charged the defendant...

02:17:02.548 --> 02:17:06.800
...with embezzlement, according to
Statute 119, Section A of the penal code."

02:17:07.011 --> 02:17:08.969
How does the defendant plead?

02:17:09.179 --> 02:17:11.431
Your Honor,
I move for a postponement.

02:17:11.639 --> 02:17:12.682
Why, Mr. Fallon?

02:17:12.892 --> 02:17:16.727
My client has been in custody only
24 hours. I've seen him only once.

02:17:16.937 --> 02:17:19.731
I've been unable to acquaint him
fully with the charges.

02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:23.317
- He's unable to enter a plea without full...
- Your Honor.

02:17:23.527 --> 02:17:25.278
- Nick, please.
- Sorry, Bill.

02:17:25.486 --> 02:17:29.406
Your Honor, there's no need for a
postponement. I understand the charge.

02:17:29.617 --> 02:17:32.576
- I knew exactly what I was doing.
- Nick.

02:17:32.786 --> 02:17:34.995
So I wish to plead guilty.

02:17:48.343 --> 02:17:52.555
I will see the deputy district attorney
and Mr. Fallon in my chambers.

02:18:03.191 --> 02:18:04.609
I'm sorry.

02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:09.197
- You have only a few minutes.
- Thank you.

02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:18.414
Nick. Oh, Nick.

02:18:22.085 --> 02:18:23.795
What happened in there?

02:18:25.297 --> 02:18:27.966
The minimum sentence, two years.

02:18:28.675 --> 02:18:31.511
With luck, I'll be out in 18 months.

02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:35.889
With luck.

02:18:37.393 --> 02:18:39.018
Why, Nick?

02:18:39.852 --> 02:18:41.728
You had a chance.

02:18:42.356 --> 02:18:45.358
All you had to do was say
that Peterson tricked you.

02:18:46.610 --> 02:18:49.028
- I couldn't say that.
- Why not?

02:18:49.237 --> 02:18:50.279
Because he didn't.

02:18:52.199 --> 02:18:54.242
I want you to divorce me.

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:00.373
What are you saying?

02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:07.797
We're just no good for each other,
that's all. Everybody knows that.

02:19:09.341 --> 02:19:12.593
Look, my darling,
I may not be good for you...

02:19:12.803 --> 02:19:15.722
...but nobody has the right to say
what's good for me.

02:19:15.931 --> 02:19:17.389
Not even you.

02:19:20.059 --> 02:19:23.603
You think I don't know that everything
that went wrong was my fault?

02:19:23.772 --> 02:19:26.566
- I know that.
- It's no use, Fanny.

02:19:27.567 --> 02:19:31.821
Look, I've tried to tell myself
I'll catch up with you.

02:19:32.072 --> 02:19:33.406
It'll be all right.

02:19:33.615 --> 02:19:36.367
But there's no way
I can catch up with you.

02:19:36.951 --> 02:19:41.371
I don't want to run anymore,
not in a race I can't win.

02:19:42.458 --> 02:19:46.627
- Let me go. Let me be myself again.
- I can't.

02:19:46.879 --> 02:19:49.047
I can't just let you go off to prison.

02:19:49.214 --> 02:19:52.633
Why not?
Wouldn't the publicity be good?

02:20:02.519 --> 02:20:04.520
I'll be with you in a minute.

02:20:07.733 --> 02:20:11.736
I'm sorry, darling.
That's what I've turned into.

02:20:13.197 --> 02:20:14.906
Nick.

02:20:15.074 --> 02:20:18.910
You think you mean this,
and maybe you do.

02:20:19.495 --> 02:20:22.455
But maybe it's just because
of all that's happened.

02:20:23.123 --> 02:20:26.667
So why don't we just
leave it for now?

02:20:26.919 --> 02:20:30.922
And if you still feel the same way
when you come home...

02:20:31.173 --> 02:20:32.882
...I won't fight you.

02:20:34.343 --> 02:20:35.885
Okay?

02:20:39.765 --> 02:20:44.393
Okay.

02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.367
Listen, you take care of yourself.

02:20:59.618 --> 02:21:03.329
Go out, see people,
do things, enjoy yourself.

02:21:04.331 --> 02:21:06.249
I don't worry about you.

02:21:06.416 --> 02:21:09.752
The moment you're out there
on that stage, nothing bothers you.

02:21:11.672 --> 02:21:13.131
Nothing.

02:21:14.675 --> 02:21:18.553
The strongest woman in the whole world,
that's what you are.

02:21:18.804 --> 02:21:20.429
Did you know that?

02:21:20.931 --> 02:21:22.640
Yeah, sure.

02:21:23.433 --> 02:21:25.601
Everybody knows that.

02:21:47.791 --> 02:21:49.834
So long, funny girl.

02:21:51.879 --> 02:21:53.546
Hey.

02:22:12.024 --> 02:22:16.235
Funny

02:22:17.154 --> 02:22:19.197
Did you hear that?

02:22:20.616 --> 02:22:23.784
Funny

02:22:24.745 --> 02:22:30.499
Yeah, the guy said
"Honey

02:22:31.668 --> 02:22:38.132
You're a funny girl"

02:22:38.717 --> 02:22:43.387
That's me
I just keep them

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:47.892
In stitches

02:22:48.644 --> 02:22:52.647
Doubled in half

02:22:53.315 --> 02:22:55.942
And though I may be

02:22:56.109 --> 02:23:00.238
All wrong for the guy

02:23:01.281 --> 02:23:03.824
I'm good for a laugh

02:23:03.992 --> 02:23:09.747
I guess it's not funny

02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:15.753
Life is far from sunny

02:23:16.797 --> 02:23:22.301
When the laugh is over

02:23:22.594 --> 02:23:29.517
And the joke's on you

02:23:29.685 --> 02:23:35.773
A girl oughta have
A sense of humor

02:23:36.566 --> 02:23:39.485
That's one thing

02:23:39.653 --> 02:23:43.823
You really need for sure

02:23:43.991 --> 02:23:51.747
When you're a funny girl

02:23:52.916 --> 02:24:00.715
The fella said, "A funny girl"

02:24:02.050 --> 02:24:04.093
Funny

02:24:04.261 --> 02:24:11.851
How it ain't so funny

02:24:12.936 --> 02:24:20.943
Funny girl

02:24:44.134 --> 02:24:46.135
It cleaned up fine.

02:24:48.472 --> 02:24:51.349
You've been sitting
in that theater all this time?

02:24:52.976 --> 02:24:54.602
You all right?

02:24:55.062 --> 02:24:57.480
Then would you see Mr. Ziegfeld?
He's waiting.

02:24:57.647 --> 02:25:00.733
Yeah. Flo, come on in.

02:25:01.443 --> 02:25:03.319
I'll get your props for you.

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:06.781
- Any word from Nick?
- No, not yet.

02:25:08.492 --> 02:25:10.409
I've been worried about you, Fanny.

02:25:10.619 --> 02:25:13.788
I'm sorry you've been worried. Flo.

02:25:16.416 --> 02:25:19.919
I don't even know
if Nick wants us to go on...

02:25:21.213 --> 02:25:23.047
...but if he does...

02:25:24.716 --> 02:25:27.051
...I don't wanna make
the same mistakes.

02:25:27.928 --> 02:25:32.014
So if it means giving up the theater,
I hope you'll be a sport about it.

02:25:32.182 --> 02:25:34.517
Well, I won't be.

02:25:35.018 --> 02:25:38.145
But I won't worry about it
till it happens.

02:25:38.355 --> 02:25:40.981
- Fifteen minutes, Miss Brice.
- Thank you.

02:25:42.401 --> 02:25:44.318
I'll let you get dressed.

02:25:48.156 --> 02:25:49.949
Be happy, dear.

02:26:27.362 --> 02:26:29.155
Hello, Fanny.

02:26:38.999 --> 02:26:42.001
You must be that fella
I met at Keeney's one night.

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:47.506
You must be that girl
from Henry Street.

02:26:56.224 --> 02:26:58.767
I feel like a kid on a blind date.

02:27:42.437 --> 02:27:44.855
Did you see the baby, darling?

02:27:45.065 --> 02:27:46.315
No.

02:27:46.733 --> 02:27:48.609
I came straight here.

02:27:49.027 --> 02:27:51.529
Well, she's gorgeous.

02:27:52.739 --> 02:27:55.074
Getting to look just like you.

02:27:59.079 --> 02:28:00.913
Who says I'm not lucky?

02:28:10.048 --> 02:28:11.549
Fanny, I...

02:28:14.844 --> 02:28:18.013
I've had 18 months to think about us.

02:28:18.932 --> 02:28:20.933
You wanna hear something funny?

02:28:21.518 --> 02:28:24.853
I've had the same 18 months,
and I never thought about us.

02:28:28.608 --> 02:28:31.610
I mean, I simmered, I stewed...

02:28:31.861 --> 02:28:34.280
...I cried my eyes out...

02:28:35.574 --> 02:28:39.243
...but I never really thought.

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.872
Not until today.

02:28:54.801 --> 02:28:56.927
Then I saw that you were right.

02:29:04.561 --> 02:29:06.604
You did a lot for me, Nick.

02:29:08.023 --> 02:29:10.149
That's what I'm gonna remember.

02:29:12.402 --> 02:29:14.945
What did I ever do for you, darling?

02:29:16.072 --> 02:29:19.908
What did I ever give you that you
couldn't have gotten for yourself?

02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.998
A blue marble egg.

02:29:28.168 --> 02:29:30.794
No one would have
given me that but you.

02:29:32.005 --> 02:29:35.507
And you... You...

02:29:35.675 --> 02:29:37.885
You made me feel sort of...

02:29:39.095 --> 02:29:43.098
...beautiful, you know,
for a very long time.

02:29:54.235 --> 02:29:56.236
You are beautiful.

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:11.460
Five minutes.

02:30:14.255 --> 02:30:17.299
There are a lot of people
waiting for you.

02:30:30.730 --> 02:30:32.523
Goodbye, Fanny.

02:30:44.703 --> 02:30:46.620
Bye, Nick.

02:31:16.109 --> 02:31:18.777
Oh, my man, I love him so

02:31:21.573 --> 02:31:22.990
He'll never know

02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:28.036
All my life is just despair

02:31:30.749 --> 02:31:32.416
But I don't care

02:31:34.586 --> 02:31:37.546
When he takes me in his arms

02:31:39.424 --> 02:31:43.802
The world is bright

02:31:44.971 --> 02:31:47.639
All right

02:31:56.775 --> 02:31:59.318
What's the difference if I say

02:32:01.613 --> 02:32:03.238
I'll go away

02:32:07.243 --> 02:32:09.661
When I know I'll come back

02:32:11.456 --> 02:32:13.874
On my knees someday

02:32:16.044 --> 02:32:18.337
For whatever my man is

02:32:18.922 --> 02:32:20.631
I am his

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:27.179
Forevermore

02:32:27.347 --> 02:32:31.433
Oh, my man, I love him so

02:32:31.601 --> 02:32:34.645
He'll never know

02:32:34.813 --> 02:32:37.022
All my life is just despair

02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:40.859
But I don't care

02:32:41.027 --> 02:32:45.531
When he takes me in his arms

02:32:45.698 --> 02:32:49.034
The world is bright

02:32:49.202 --> 02:32:54.331
All right

02:32:54.499 --> 02:32:58.585
What's the difference if I say

02:32:58.753 --> 02:33:00.921
I'll go away

02:33:01.089 --> 02:33:03.131
When I know I'll come back

02:33:03.299 --> 02:33:08.011
On my knees someday

02:33:08.179 --> 02:33:12.140
For whatever my man is

02:33:12.308 --> 02:33:14.977
I am his

02:33:15.144 --> 02:33:31.326
Forevermore

02:33:32.305 --> 02:33:38.892
