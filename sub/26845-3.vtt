WEBVTT

00:04.218 --> 00:06.218
( music playing )

00:36.343 --> 00:38.468
( playing old-world
sounding anthem )

01:02.010 --> 01:05.010
( Russian accent ) Shut up.
You are such a silly man.

01:05.094 --> 01:07.510
You think I don't know
what my job is.

01:07.593 --> 01:09.844
All I do is create chaos.

01:09.927 --> 01:11.552
That is what
you're going to get.

01:11.635 --> 01:13.468
Trust me, I'm quite serious.

01:13.552 --> 01:15.218
I already started
putting more money

01:15.301 --> 01:17.510
into groups of little punks
in Grozny,

01:17.593 --> 01:19.844
nationalistic skinheads...

01:22.301 --> 01:23.677
Doesn't matter.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.010
Doesn't matter.

01:26.094 --> 01:27.426
Listen. Two things matter:

01:27.510 --> 01:29.010
They need to have a good name

01:29.094 --> 01:31.094
so that they seem
like a movement.

01:31.176 --> 01:33.677
But then also crucial
is we have to fund

01:33.760 --> 01:37.260
the little
whatever-they're-called
young socialists

01:37.343 --> 01:39.426
or whatever is the opposite.

01:39.510 --> 01:42.885
Yes. Non-skinheads.

01:42.969 --> 01:46.885
Hey... get some hippie kids
from the university

01:46.969 --> 01:50.635
who listen to folk music
and love gays and Pussy Riot

01:50.718 --> 01:53.677
and the "power to the people."

01:53.760 --> 01:55.176
Yes. Exactly.

01:55.260 --> 01:57.094
It definitely will confuse
some people.

01:57.176 --> 01:59.760
We need to confuse some people.

01:59.844 --> 02:01.010
We got this.

02:01.094 --> 02:03.760
The takeaway here is,
I am on a trip.

02:03.844 --> 02:05.176
I will be right back.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.885
It is personal.

02:06.969 --> 02:10.718
That is why they are called
personal days.

02:10.802 --> 02:13.552
Just tell them,
"You either ride with us

02:13.635 --> 02:15.052
or collide with us."

02:17.094 --> 02:20.718
Yes, you might say,
"You have no choice."

02:20.802 --> 02:23.343
Or "My way or the highway."

02:23.426 --> 02:27.343
But someone who is a non-idiot

02:27.426 --> 02:30.552
might say what I have suggested.

02:30.635 --> 02:35.927
You are aware that sometimes
you come off like you've never
managed a democracy before.

02:36.010 --> 02:36.927
Peace.

02:39.468 --> 02:40.593
My God.

02:42.176 --> 02:45.176
I do not even really
have time to take a shower.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.510
She's supposed to get here
at 8:00.

02:47.593 --> 02:49.176
( Russian accent )
You'll never be sad

02:49.260 --> 02:51.927
if you take a shower
before you meet a woman.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.052
( door slams, water running )

02:59.135 --> 03:01.218
- How's your room?
- It's a dump.

03:01.301 --> 03:04.343
It's fine.
It's identical to this one.

03:04.426 --> 03:07.635
( as Liz Taylor
doing Bette Davis)
"What a dump! What's that from?"

03:07.718 --> 03:10.635
- ( water shuts off )
- Liz Taylor doing Bette Davis.

03:10.718 --> 03:12.927
I know! That's what she says.
She asks that.

03:13.010 --> 03:14.718
She says "What's this from?"

03:14.802 --> 03:16.885
- It's in the play, it's not me.
- I know.

03:16.969 --> 03:19.885
But seriously,
why did you choose this place?

03:19.969 --> 03:23.135
Yeah, I did not want to come on
too strong, you know. Too fancy.

03:23.218 --> 03:27.176
She seems very down-to-earth
in her emails.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.385
Well, I won't be out
too late tonight.

03:29.468 --> 03:31.385
If this one-horse town
has no piano bar,

03:31.468 --> 03:33.760
I will search out
this famous "Walmart."

03:33.844 --> 03:36.927
It's so nice to see
how different countries
do their packaging.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.135
I love it.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.760
There I will buy
a six-pack of beer

03:39.844 --> 03:42.176
because for some reason
there is no hotel bar here.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.260
Which was definitely
your mistake.

03:44.343 --> 03:47.593
You know something, most girls
do not want to meet a man

03:47.677 --> 03:50.426
for the first time
in a motel room.

03:50.510 --> 03:53.260
I explained the situation
and I already said

03:53.343 --> 03:55.927
there will be security here
and all that.

03:56.010 --> 03:58.802
She understands.
It's normal.

03:58.885 --> 04:01.468
It's normal perhaps for
some kind of important

04:01.552 --> 04:03.468
political technologist
in our country,

04:03.552 --> 04:05.218
but for her
it's non-standard.

04:05.301 --> 04:06.760
Let me see you.

04:06.844 --> 04:09.635
Bars, public spaces,
that's normal.

04:09.718 --> 04:11.260
- Hmm.
- No, no, no.

04:11.343 --> 04:12.426
I'm sure it's fine.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.844
You trust each other.
I get it.

04:14.927 --> 04:17.552
Well.

04:17.635 --> 04:22.385
I am not going to try
to sleep with her.

04:22.468 --> 04:25.969
I'm going to try
to really make a connection.

04:26.052 --> 04:27.176
( giggles )

04:27.260 --> 04:30.301
Hi, I'm Darla Andrews.
I'm...

04:30.385 --> 04:32.260
Oh... ( giggles )

04:32.343 --> 04:34.927
Okay, um... yeah.

04:36.552 --> 04:38.343
Ms. Darla Andrews.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.927
Uh, hi.

04:43.010 --> 04:44.969
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Darla.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.426
Ochin'priyatna.
So nice to meet you, Darla.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.593
I'm so sorry,
but I have to run.

04:50.677 --> 04:51.593
Oh.

04:55.635 --> 04:57.301
You must be Nathan.

04:57.385 --> 05:00.468
Ciao. "Nathan."

05:00.552 --> 05:02.176
( giggles )

05:02.260 --> 05:03.927
( door closes )

05:07.301 --> 05:11.260
Thank you for
coming to meet me.

05:11.343 --> 05:12.927
I was looking forward to it.

05:13.010 --> 05:17.010
Yes, please. This way.

05:17.094 --> 05:21.135
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes.

05:22.927 --> 05:25.218
( clears throat ) It's fancy.

05:25.301 --> 05:30.343
I have very much enjoyed
our correspondence.

05:30.426 --> 05:32.176
Oh, I...

05:32.260 --> 05:34.052
I just think you're
such a great writer.

05:34.135 --> 05:36.510
It has been
such a pleasure. Really.

05:36.593 --> 05:40.426
Eh. I am an amateur at best.

05:40.510 --> 05:42.010
( laughs ) Oh, no.

05:42.094 --> 05:44.510
You are very lovely in person.

05:44.593 --> 05:47.010
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

05:50.135 --> 05:51.593
I hope I look like my picture.

05:51.677 --> 05:52.885
At least enough.

05:52.969 --> 05:55.552
- Totally! Do not worry!
- ( phone rings )

05:55.635 --> 05:59.927
Oh, unbelievable!
Fuck my mother.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.552
Eh...

06:01.635 --> 06:03.343
I have to take this.

06:03.426 --> 06:04.885
So sorry for the swearing.

06:04.969 --> 06:07.718
I did not want to be called
when I am just meeting you.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.343
Bastards.

06:09.426 --> 06:11.844
You do very high-level
English language swearing.

06:11.927 --> 06:12.969
Hello.

06:13.052 --> 06:15.552
Yes. I told you I was doing it.

06:15.635 --> 06:20.552
Hell yes,
I told everybody
I was doing it.

06:20.635 --> 06:22.385
Oh. Thanks.

06:22.468 --> 06:25.010
The question you need
to be asking is,

06:25.135 --> 06:29.176
how can you afford
not to back your own enemies?

06:29.260 --> 06:30.385
( cork pops )

06:30.468 --> 06:32.510
No rational person
would do that,

06:32.593 --> 06:37.510
so then how can they
understand that we did it?

06:37.593 --> 06:39.593
- Exactly! They can't.
- Oh, thank you.

06:39.677 --> 06:42.260
Some biker gangs
are also supporting us.

06:42.343 --> 06:44.802
And I have
a Black Panther type thing

06:44.885 --> 06:47.760
in the works
I haven't even announced yet.

06:47.844 --> 06:50.635
That's right, baby!
They won't even know
what hit them!

06:50.718 --> 06:51.593
( giggles )

06:51.677 --> 06:54.885
Bam! Be gone.
All right.

06:54.969 --> 06:56.593
I'm so sorry.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.426
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but you seen like you've been

06:58.510 --> 07:01.927
a little modest about
having such a fancy job.

07:02.010 --> 07:04.260
I do not admire false modesty.

07:04.343 --> 07:09.176
It's true that in my country
I have some influence.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.260
The people we are discussing

07:11.343 --> 07:14.552
will be like
your cartoon characters,

07:14.635 --> 07:18.885
with the birds and the stars
spinning around the head area.

07:18.969 --> 07:19.844
Bam!

07:19.927 --> 07:21.468
( chuckles )

07:21.552 --> 07:25.677
But although I have been
a person of influence,

07:25.760 --> 07:28.094
that is not why I am here.

07:28.176 --> 07:33.260
Oh, I don't think you came
all this way just to like,
"influence" me.

07:33.343 --> 07:36.802
A side effect
of having influence

07:36.885 --> 07:40.635
is that it can be distorting
to you personally.

07:40.718 --> 07:44.135
Like how, um...
rich people never know

07:44.218 --> 07:47.260
if someone really likes them
or just wants their money?

07:47.343 --> 07:50.844
Yes, I would expect it
would be similar.

07:50.927 --> 07:52.010
Hmm.

07:52.094 --> 07:55.052
It is a funhouse mirror,
in a way,

07:55.135 --> 08:00.010
and then you forget
what you really look like.

08:00.094 --> 08:04.426
I used to know more rich people,
and they had worries like that.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.844
I used to make more money, too,
that's why--

08:07.927 --> 08:11.844
I mean, I'm-I'm doing good.
I'm fine now.

08:11.927 --> 08:15.969
I'm great, actually.
This looks delicious.

08:16.052 --> 08:19.426
I'm glad that it appeals to you.

08:23.718 --> 08:28.343
So, where you're from,
um, what does it signify

08:28.426 --> 08:30.885
when a man wears, um--

08:30.969 --> 08:33.552
So, you are a veterinarian?

08:33.635 --> 08:37.552
Um... almost.

08:37.635 --> 08:39.760
I am a veterinary nurse.

08:39.844 --> 08:42.552
You care for baby animals.

08:42.635 --> 08:44.927
Yup, and they love it.

08:45.010 --> 08:47.218
You, uh, put the medicines

08:47.301 --> 08:50.343
in their eyes and their ears.

08:50.426 --> 08:53.927
- Yeah, all that.
- That is nice, isn't it?

08:54.010 --> 08:56.927
Yeah. It's so pure,
how people love their pets.

08:57.010 --> 08:59.677
Sometimes it is hard, though,
when I...

08:59.760 --> 09:03.677
when I can't help them,
but it's always really real.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.844
And that can be hard to come by.

09:05.927 --> 09:08.343
What is that supposed to mean?

09:10.802 --> 09:12.677
Nothing. I...

09:12.760 --> 09:14.635
I'm so sorry.

09:14.718 --> 09:16.927
Sometimes I stress myself out.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.260
Of course, you are just
talking about,

09:19.343 --> 09:23.010
uh, "keeping it real," right?

09:23.094 --> 09:25.969
Exactly. Yeah.

09:26.052 --> 09:29.969
It's just, you know...

09:30.052 --> 09:32.510
talking about my job.

09:32.593 --> 09:34.885
Do you like vodka?

09:34.969 --> 09:36.677
Yeah.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.718
I know gay guys who make it
a point not to lisp,

09:40.802 --> 09:45.677
and French guys who make it
a point not to womanize.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.969
But no.

09:47.052 --> 09:51.260
I had to be a Russian
who likes vodka.

09:51.343 --> 09:53.760
- ( laughs )
- ( door opens )

09:53.844 --> 09:58.593
But at least
I am not provincial--

09:58.677 --> 10:02.135
this vodka... is Canadian.

10:02.218 --> 10:04.468
( both laugh )

10:04.552 --> 10:05.552
( knock at door )

10:21.802 --> 10:23.176
Spasibo.

10:28.927 --> 10:30.760
( pouring )

10:34.176 --> 10:35.635
To my first

10:35.718 --> 10:39.094
international internet date.

10:39.176 --> 10:41.552
( laughs )
Mine, too, actually.

10:41.635 --> 10:43.094
International.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.176
( glasses clink )

10:44.260 --> 10:45.094
Yes.

10:45.176 --> 10:48.094
But, uh, domestic?

10:51.176 --> 10:54.760
I mean, I've tried.
Uh, You know.

10:54.844 --> 10:58.218
What were they like, the others?

10:58.301 --> 10:59.885
Oh, jeez.

10:59.969 --> 11:02.760
Um, well, one guy,

11:02.844 --> 11:04.802
uh, started telling me
on the second drink

11:04.885 --> 11:06.552
how badly he wanted
to have kids.

11:06.635 --> 11:07.718
Oof.

11:07.802 --> 11:10.593
So... yeah.

11:10.677 --> 11:12.593
Do you really want
to hear about this?

11:12.677 --> 11:13.593
Mm-hmm.

11:14.927 --> 11:16.343
Okay, well,

11:16.426 --> 11:18.218
I really don't care
what a guy's job is,

11:18.301 --> 11:21.885
but I did notice when
I started going on these dates,

11:21.969 --> 11:24.426
that all of them,
the rich ones and the poor ones,

11:24.510 --> 11:27.677
they all seem to think that they
should be doing better by now.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.677
You know?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.385
Like making more money,

11:30.468 --> 11:32.343
or just being happier.

11:32.426 --> 11:37.468
It's really tender
when a stranger shares
something intimate with you.

11:37.552 --> 11:39.218
You know?

11:39.301 --> 11:41.468
They didn't even know
they're transmitting it,

11:41.552 --> 11:45.593
but they were blaring it
like neon signs of sadness.

11:45.677 --> 11:47.094
Every single one of them.

11:47.176 --> 11:48.135
Hmm.

11:50.135 --> 11:52.301
Was it a lot?

11:52.385 --> 11:53.844
Sometimes.

11:53.927 --> 11:55.635
Some of them
just more of like a...

11:55.718 --> 11:57.718
like a slight melancholy vibe.

11:57.802 --> 11:58.677
Guys...

11:58.760 --> 12:02.176
Was it a lot of guys?

12:02.260 --> 12:03.176
Oh.

12:04.260 --> 12:06.176
Oh.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.635
Um...

12:12.385 --> 12:15.927
Well, I didn't sleep
with them...

12:16.010 --> 12:17.343
all.

12:17.426 --> 12:20.260
- ( phone vibrates )
- Good. All good.

12:20.343 --> 12:22.426
'Scusey! I-- so sorry.

12:22.510 --> 12:25.593
You see, I'd like to get
to know more about you,
as a person.

12:25.677 --> 12:30.844
One of my best qualities
is my attentive listening
and my interest in others.

12:30.927 --> 12:32.677
Idiots.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.218
Do you prefer fish
or chicken?

12:41.301 --> 12:42.218
Fish.

12:42.301 --> 12:43.218
Hmm.

12:45.218 --> 12:48.468
- ( clanging )
- ( sighs )

12:48.552 --> 12:50.301
( sniffs )

12:50.385 --> 12:55.135
It was the same when
I worked in reality TV.

12:55.218 --> 12:57.218
Listening, observation.

12:57.301 --> 12:59.301
You guys have reality TV?

12:59.385 --> 13:00.969
Of course we do.

13:01.052 --> 13:04.385
Do you know that sometimes
it isn't totally real?

13:04.468 --> 13:08.343
You know, I think that
it used to more real,

13:08.426 --> 13:10.552
- The way you hold attention,
- but then it became obvious

13:10.635 --> 13:12.802
- tease people, make them wait,
- that they're just
casting people

13:12.885 --> 13:15.385
- dazzle them with spectacle,
- that we know are gonna
flame out

13:15.468 --> 13:18.343
- is very structured.
- or be like, "I didn't
come here to make friends."

13:18.426 --> 13:19.927
It's not all literally true.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.844
We are saying the same thing,

13:23.927 --> 13:25.010
in fact.

13:25.094 --> 13:26.510
Yeah.

13:26.593 --> 13:31.052
Um... well, I, uh,

13:31.135 --> 13:34.010
have to say I think
it's really great
that you've been able

13:34.094 --> 13:36.885
to stay so creative while
having a government job.

13:36.969 --> 13:41.844
You know, those two things
seem really different in
my mind, but what do I know?

13:41.927 --> 13:45.010
Um, I was really sad
I couldn't read your book.

13:45.094 --> 13:48.010
I looked for it,
but I couldn't find it
in English.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.218
It is a wonderful book,

13:50.301 --> 13:52.426
but I didn't write it.

13:52.510 --> 13:53.760
You didn't write it?

13:53.844 --> 13:54.844
No.

13:54.927 --> 13:55.927
Oh.

13:56.010 --> 13:57.593
I wish.

13:57.677 --> 14:00.677
It has somebody else's
name on it.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.176
Someone else named
Nathan Ivanovich?

14:03.260 --> 14:05.718
That is not my name.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.760
A pen name...

14:07.844 --> 14:08.927
I guess so.

14:09.010 --> 14:10.052
Do you like the fish?

14:10.135 --> 14:12.010
So what's
your real name?

14:14.468 --> 14:18.927
You know,
I also designed a city.

14:20.802 --> 14:22.301
Did I tell you about that?

14:22.385 --> 14:27.385
It's not finished yet,
but maybe you could come see it.

14:27.468 --> 14:29.176
What do you like to be called?

14:29.260 --> 14:32.927
I am like the guy who wanted
to have a baby with you

14:33.010 --> 14:34.718
on the second drink.

14:34.802 --> 14:39.468
I did not mean to invite you
to Russia so soon.
I apologize.

14:39.552 --> 14:41.385
Why did you want me
to call you by your pen name?

14:41.468 --> 14:44.010
I didn't say it
was my pen name.

14:44.094 --> 14:47.468
I mean, the book
is a piece of shit.

14:47.552 --> 14:50.969
Ivanovich is a
Hamlet-obsessed hack.

14:51.052 --> 14:56.010
I would've been
totally embarrassed
to have written it.

14:56.094 --> 14:58.468
Let me sign you a copy.

14:58.552 --> 15:02.927
Well, whomever he is,
why do you think
he's obsessed with Hamlet?

15:03.010 --> 15:06.844
Are you kidding? All Russians
should be obsessed with Hamlet.

15:06.927 --> 15:08.718
It is the story of
power-obsessed men

15:08.802 --> 15:11.094
with small areas
of total dominion,

15:11.176 --> 15:13.052
the occasional murder
by poisoning

15:13.135 --> 15:15.552
and a basic inability
to tell what is real,

15:15.635 --> 15:20.426
what is a ghost,
what's happening, who's crazy,
and who's sane.

15:20.510 --> 15:22.176
It's brilliant.

15:35.927 --> 15:37.760
What do your friends call you?

15:37.844 --> 15:39.969
That again?

15:40.052 --> 15:41.593
Seriously.

15:44.426 --> 15:45.385
( mutters )

15:48.426 --> 15:49.593
Pardon?

15:49.677 --> 15:50.718
( mutters )

15:50.802 --> 15:54.176
I still didn't catch it.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.426
( mutters )

15:56.510 --> 16:00.635
Hey, what is your favorite
kind of Russian music?

16:00.718 --> 16:02.969
Oh, I don't really know
any Russian music.

16:03.052 --> 16:08.135
I did hear those guys
out there, but, uh,
that's about it.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.343
Okay, so in this country,

16:11.426 --> 16:15.094
when a man wears a piece
of jewelry on this finger,

16:15.176 --> 16:17.510
it typically signifies--

16:17.593 --> 16:19.844
Nom de plume.

16:19.927 --> 16:22.760
No, that he's married.

16:22.844 --> 16:24.218
So...

16:24.301 --> 16:27.593
Okay, I know that sometimes
people lie on their profiles,

16:27.677 --> 16:31.052
like tell little white lies
like about their height
or their age--

16:31.135 --> 16:34.176
Nom de guerre like "The Fox,"
or "The Jackal."

16:34.260 --> 16:37.510
No. That's...

16:37.593 --> 16:41.094
No, I think that there's
a language barrier,
'cause what I--

16:41.176 --> 16:43.510
- Pen name. Real name.
- Right.

16:43.593 --> 16:47.552
That's a pen name,
and then what's your real name?

16:47.635 --> 16:49.760
- Pen name.
- Right, that's a pen name.

16:49.844 --> 16:52.802
Real name, pen name,
real name.

16:54.510 --> 16:58.844
Don't matter what you call me.

No? Oh. Well, okay.

18:50.218 --> 18:51.385
Okay, then.

18:51.468 --> 18:54.718
Eh, gentlemen, give us a minute.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.010
I thought you were going
to this famous "Walmart."

19:03.094 --> 19:04.593
Overrated.

19:07.052 --> 19:11.677
Are you okay?
We have a salad course.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.260
Would you like a salad course?

19:14.343 --> 19:16.802
I--I don't need
a salad course. Um...

19:16.885 --> 19:19.593
( clears throat )

19:19.677 --> 19:23.260
I'm very flattered.

19:23.343 --> 19:27.052
You're an incredible singer,
and dancer...

19:27.135 --> 19:28.718
and rapper.

19:31.593 --> 19:34.426
There's still an elephant
in the room, though.

19:36.385 --> 19:39.510
Excuse me just a moment.

19:42.802 --> 19:43.802
( door closes )

19:43.885 --> 19:46.218
What's his real name?

19:46.301 --> 19:48.552
You're still on that?

19:48.635 --> 19:50.969
I don't understand,

19:51.052 --> 19:53.969
our emails were so promising.

19:54.052 --> 19:55.301
I know what it's like.

19:55.385 --> 19:56.885
- You do?
- Sure.

19:56.969 --> 19:59.635
Being pampered by
a charismatic leader
in a hotel room...

19:59.718 --> 20:02.552
where maybe even he thinks
he's in love with you.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.010
Plus, power is intoxicating.

20:05.094 --> 20:07.260
- So is vodka.
- Isn't that what dates are for?

20:07.343 --> 20:10.718
You squint at things
and try to see the best
in a guy.

20:10.802 --> 20:14.802
I like giving people
the benefit of the doubt. I do.

20:16.218 --> 20:18.260
Wait, are you in character
right now?

20:18.343 --> 20:19.426
Often. I lose track.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.426
You didn't even Google him?

20:22.510 --> 20:24.802
I didn't think I needed to.

20:24.885 --> 20:26.385
We'd been emailing for months.

20:26.468 --> 20:27.301
I thought--

20:27.385 --> 20:28.552
Girl, it's not that hard.

20:28.635 --> 20:29.969
Especially after Crimea.

20:30.052 --> 20:31.927
When I walked in here,

20:32.010 --> 20:33.885
he was wearing a wedding ring.

20:33.969 --> 20:35.593
But when I checked again,
he wasn't.

20:35.677 --> 20:37.677
And then
I swear he just was.

20:37.760 --> 20:42.176
He can be a little bit
indecisive about
his self-presentation.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.426
Girl. Seriously,
what are you doing?

20:47.510 --> 20:51.176
I don't know.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.927
You know what,
you're a grown woman.

20:54.010 --> 20:55.176
Figure it out.

20:56.635 --> 20:58.844
( door opens and closes )

20:58.927 --> 20:59.760
( sighs )

20:59.844 --> 21:04.468
Alas, Nathan Ivanovich.

21:04.552 --> 21:08.094
I never knew you.

21:10.343 --> 21:15.426
I don't know what is,
only what seems to be.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.552
Or not to be.

21:19.844 --> 21:22.927
How do we even hold up
this heavy life,

21:23.010 --> 21:26.844
which I myself have had
a hand in reducing

21:26.927 --> 21:29.927
down to bare survival?

21:30.010 --> 21:31.552
Survival.

21:33.343 --> 21:36.969
Survival sucks,
but it is possible

21:37.052 --> 21:40.218
death is worse.

21:43.635 --> 21:48.052
Of all the things
I have been party to,

21:48.135 --> 21:51.510
I, who have the power

21:51.593 --> 21:55.510
to bend the course of history,

21:55.593 --> 21:58.885
have come up
against a problem--

22:01.176 --> 22:04.052
one small woman...

22:04.135 --> 22:06.593
and who to be to her.

22:10.552 --> 22:13.552
I should be real to her.

22:15.094 --> 22:18.593
Unless I am corroded
to my depth.

22:21.844 --> 22:24.927
I am out of scale.
I feel myself so.

22:28.969 --> 22:31.176
I should give it a whirl.

22:35.635 --> 22:39.301
( door opens )

22:45.176 --> 22:48.301
Are you married?

22:49.426 --> 22:52.301
Well, yes and no.

22:52.385 --> 22:53.677
( sighs )

22:53.760 --> 22:55.260
I just Googled you.

22:55.343 --> 22:57.552
And if I'm not mistaken,

22:57.635 --> 22:59.635
you have a wife.

23:00.802 --> 23:02.552
You can Google me?

23:02.635 --> 23:04.718
Yeah. I can.

23:04.802 --> 23:06.593
It was pretty easy, too.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.844
It would've been easier if you
didn't have so many pseudonyms.

23:09.927 --> 23:12.468
Hmm.

23:12.552 --> 23:16.635
So, do you and your wife
have some sort of arrangement?

23:16.718 --> 23:19.552
Eh, yes and no.

23:19.635 --> 23:22.052
What's that
supposed to mean?

23:22.135 --> 23:23.927
Well, I mean, sort of.

23:24.010 --> 23:25.260
There's no sort of.

23:25.343 --> 23:27.385
Either you're married
or you aren't,

23:27.468 --> 23:29.969
or your wife and you have
an arrangement or you don't.

23:30.052 --> 23:31.385
Don't get upset.

23:31.468 --> 23:33.052
I'm not upset.

23:36.052 --> 23:38.510
I just need to know.

23:38.593 --> 23:41.969
I mean,
I'm not above casual sex,

23:42.052 --> 23:45.844
but I think we both know
that's not why we're here.

23:47.885 --> 23:51.844
I really liked writing to you
and I like talking to you

23:51.927 --> 23:56.885
and now we're in a hotel room
and I need to know.

24:03.718 --> 24:07.718
Why didn't you ask me before
about being married.

24:07.802 --> 24:10.052
Because you checked
the box.

24:10.135 --> 24:11.135
What box?

24:11.218 --> 24:14.135
The one about
being single.

24:14.218 --> 24:16.260
Oops.

24:16.343 --> 24:17.260
( sighs )

24:20.176 --> 24:23.094
Did you lie about
the sex questions, too?

24:23.176 --> 24:27.385
No. No, no, no, no.
Of course not. Never.

24:27.468 --> 24:29.635
It would mess up the algorithm.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.301
( sighs )

24:32.385 --> 24:35.010
What's the point of having
a girlfriend or a mistress

24:35.094 --> 24:37.010
or whatever it is
you want me to be

24:37.094 --> 24:38.885
if you're just gonna act
the same way you do

24:38.969 --> 24:41.260
at home, or at work,
or whatever?

24:42.760 --> 24:44.593
I know.

24:44.677 --> 24:48.094
This is the tragedy of my life.

24:48.176 --> 24:49.969
( scoffs )

24:50.052 --> 24:52.885
Do you know
the tragedy of my life?

24:54.969 --> 24:56.094
No.

24:56.176 --> 24:58.426
I know.
Because you never asked me.

24:58.510 --> 25:00.010
You're really charming
on the internet,

25:00.094 --> 25:01.510
but then in person,
you don't even ask me

25:01.593 --> 25:03.343
shit like what's
the tragedy of my life

25:03.426 --> 25:05.969
or even if
my parents are alive.

25:06.052 --> 25:07.802
I know your parents are alive
because it came up

25:07.885 --> 25:11.677
in the email when you
went back to Wisconsin.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.010
For my dad's funeral.

25:16.718 --> 25:19.135
This is not my first language.

25:22.260 --> 25:27.385
Don't you even wanna try being
honest just for like one day,
like for an experiment?

25:27.468 --> 25:30.426
- ( stammers )
- ( scoffs )

25:30.510 --> 25:34.552
Look, I need to be
around someone real,

25:34.635 --> 25:37.260
and, Darla,
I can feel that about you.

25:37.343 --> 25:40.010
You are so freaking real.

25:40.094 --> 25:43.385
And... all I do
is create chaos--

25:43.468 --> 25:45.052
which is remarkably
effective--

25:45.135 --> 25:47.010
but you are actually,
truly real.

25:47.094 --> 25:49.426
And that-that
is what I need.

25:49.510 --> 25:51.010
That is why I am here.

25:51.094 --> 25:53.635
I'm sorry.
I... I'm gonna go.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.468
No, no, no, no, no!
Please, please.

25:55.552 --> 25:57.969
Please stay
just for a little longer.

25:58.052 --> 26:00.094
Hey, stay for dessert.

26:00.176 --> 26:01.593
A wonderful
white chocolate mousse.

26:01.677 --> 26:04.343
I need to go. Oh, my God.

26:04.426 --> 26:06.426
( speaking Russian )

26:06.510 --> 26:10.176
No, no, no, they are saying
that it is not safe for you

26:10.260 --> 26:13.426
to leave because
there is a... wildfire.

26:13.510 --> 26:15.844
I don't see any wildfire.

26:15.927 --> 26:17.885
( speaking Russian )

26:21.677 --> 26:23.927
Oh, yes. They are saying
there is a shooting.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.593
It's not safe for you to go.

26:25.677 --> 26:27.593
I didn't hear any shooting,
did you?

26:27.677 --> 26:31.260
Some threat of shooting
or a bomb threat
or something like that.

26:31.343 --> 26:33.885
I don't believe you.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.718
- ( jiggling doorknob)
- All right.

26:36.802 --> 26:38.969
Oh, my God!

26:39.052 --> 26:41.094
They lock it from the outside?

26:42.885 --> 26:45.301
No, no, please,
please relax.

26:45.385 --> 26:46.635
( sighs )

26:46.718 --> 26:49.010
You'll break the knob.

26:49.094 --> 26:51.635
Thank you for staying.

26:51.718 --> 26:55.301
It means a lot to me.

26:55.385 --> 27:00.426
There is so much to say
about the tragedy of my life.

27:00.510 --> 27:02.010
And from your writing,

27:02.094 --> 27:06.635
I believe you will really
be able to understand the pains

27:06.718 --> 27:08.135
that come from being

27:08.218 --> 27:11.969
such an important
political technologist.

27:12.052 --> 27:15.385
You see, it started
when I was a child.

27:18.260 --> 27:21.677
At the academy
in the mountains,

27:21.760 --> 27:25.218
the Ural Mountains.

27:25.301 --> 27:29.176
- They can be beautiful...
- ( sighs )

27:29.260 --> 27:31.426
but they can be deadly.

27:31.510 --> 27:34.426
( old-world sounding anthem
playing )

28:33.635 --> 28:35.468
-♪ (LOW BASS MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
-(SIZZLING)

28:36.010 --> 28:38.802
Thank you for doing what
nobody else seems to understand.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.260
I'm excited for this,
and for my turn next.

28:41.343 --> 28:43.343
It didn't hurt much at all,
by the way.

28:43.426 --> 28:47.343
Oh. Shall we,
before it gets cold? (LAUGHS)
